No more than that.	Nulla id ipsum quam.
You just don't like that you can't do anything for me.	Tu modo non placet quod mihi aliquid facere non potes.
And you can do nothing.	Et nihil potes.
Look at me as yourself.	Me ipsum vide ut ipsum.
He understood him.	Intellexit eum.
I don't need it.	Mihi non opus est.
It's big enough.	Satis magna est.
It can be done exactly.	Fieri prorsus potest.
Do so.	Fac ita.
I didn't want to be here.	Ego hic esse nolui.
He did this work.	Faceret hoc opus.
I thought this was right.	Recte hoc putavi.
He comes when he comes.	Venit cum venit.
What you do not do.	Quod non facis.
It is good to see the truth.	Bonum est videre verum.
i feel bad.	male sentio.
he however.	ille tamen.
You have to win.	Vincere habes.
But who are you.	Sed quis es.
I'm just glad you can find time.	Modo gaudeo te posse invenire tempus.
The father could marry.	Potuit pater uxorem.
I know this.	Hoc scio.
Talk a lot.	Loqui multum.
I don't want to see what's up now.	Nolo videre quid nunc est.
that was my plan.	id mihi consilium esset.
Do your job.	Tuum fac officium.
No that was none.	Nulla id nulla erat.
I don't know what's wrong with this.	Nescio quid hoc mali sit.
for it was for him.	Erat enim ei.
Which he did not want to understand.	Quod intelligere nolebat.
No that was none.	Nulla id nulla erat.
Now no time out.	Nunc nec tempus ex.
That is always true.	Id semper verum est.
We don't have to be here today.	Nos hodie hic esse non habemus.
Well said.	Bene dixit.
he was still alone.	adhuc solus erat.
But that's none of it.	Sed id ipsum nulla.
He could do everything.	Omnia posset.
So you can do whatever you want.	Sic potes quod vis.
But nothing to him.	Sed nihil ad eum.
He did not know.	Nesciebat.
I was told not to speak.	Dictum est mihi non loqui.
But this is not seen.	Sed id non videtur.
It was so early.	Mane sic erat.
It would seem that you cannot.	Videtur quod non potes.
I love it too.	id quoque amo.
He does not come.	Non venit.
Even if you are alone.	Etiam si solus es.
I have a plan.	Habeo consilium.
Too much for me to do.	Nimium me facere.
Even now to yourself.	Etiam nunc ut ipsum.
I am a dog.	Ego sum canis.
But do not go.	Sed noli ire.
His wife.	Suam.
This or nothing.	Hoc vel nihil.
This is enough.	Hoc ipsum satis est.
to have, to have.	habui, habere.
You are right indeed.	Recte tu quidem.
But he has more than counsel.	Sed plus habet, quam consilium.
He is not here for me.	Non est hic mihi.
The problem was for us.	Quaestio, erat nobis.
Or it.	Vel id.
This is so good and so easy.	Hoc tam bonum et tam facile.
But it was getting late.	Sed sero questus fuit.
We cannot do this.	Hoc fieri non possumus.
It's too hard.	Nimis difficile est.
It was a long night.	Nocte diu fuit.
She could still do it.	Posset adhuc facere.
That was it.	Erat id.
This is not mine!	Hoc non est meum!
Nothing was good.	Nihil erat bonum.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est verum.
I don't know whether he will do it, but so.	Nescio an id facturus sit, sed ut.
I see something in you.	Aliquid video in te.
Nothing else seemed to be done.	Nihil aliud agere videbatur.
She asked him.	Rogavit eum.
Just me now, she thought.	Modo me modo, putavit.
this is!	hoc est!.
there! 	ibi!
And it was so.	Et factum est ita.
That's not right now.	Ut non nunc.
But let's be honest.	Sed sit amet.
he often saw her.	eam saepe vidit.
This is not yet certain.	Hoc nondum certum est.
The matter is so.	Ita res est.
Maybe not yourself.	Aliquam non ipsum.
Hardly thinking.	Vix cogitas.
It is not enough	Non satis est .
To or unless he wants.	Ut vel nisi velit.
It is.	Sic est.
He saw there was none.	Vidit erat non.
He was a man.	homo erat.
I'm glad to see you too.	Gaudeo te quoque videre.
There was no time for that.	Nulla id tempus erat.
To get a no for.	Ut a nulla enim.
It should be very nice.	Debet esse admodum.
Please take a look at it.	Vide quaeso eam.
I hope not to be.	Spero non esse.
They are not who and what you are.	Non sunt qui et quid es.
It was great.	Erat magna.
This guy says it's all up to the point.	Haec omnia ad rem dicit guy est.
But now, this time.	Sed nunc, hoc tempore.
But time to choose.	Sed tempus ut velit.
He came home.	Domum venit.
Do it well.	Fac bene est.
That's good to hear.	Quod est bonum, audire.
Don't say it again.	Noli iterum dicere.
But not much longer.	Sed non multo iam.
Talk to you.	Loqui tecum.
Now I know what it is.	Nunc scio quid sit.
What do you want to do?	Quid vis hoc facere?
I just couldn't do it.	Modo non potuit facere.
He didn't want to be.	Nolebat esse.
I could not give.	Dare non potui.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
Don't do it.	Noli facere.
The morning was not the same.	Mane idem non fuit.
And i have a job.	Et habeo officium.
Now like.	Iam simile.
Good and bad.	Bonum et malum.
I want to tell you this.	hoc tibi dicere volo.
It does not please.	Non placet.
It can't help.	Illud adiuvare non potest.
I could not do it right, father.	Non potui recte, pater.
All right, however.	Recte tamen.
Have you said anything yet?	Dixisti adhuc aliquid?
I really want him to be here.	Ego vere eum hic esse volo.
To do something.	Facere aliquid.
There is more to come.	Plus est venire.
Maybe that's none before.	Aliquam id nulla ante.
That would certainly be good.	Quod certe bona faceret.
It was great to do.	Multum facere.
Again, this is not true.	Iterum, hoc verum non est.
we cannot see the future.	in futurum videre non possumus.
So he was here.	Ita hic fuit.
So now he thought he knew.	Sic nunc putabat se scire.
They are not as you want.	Non sunt ut vis.
Police said never played.	Aliquam dictum numquam ipsum.
If you still can.	Si usque potes.
But that's enough.	Sed id satis.
Tomorrow will be better than today, that's for sure.	Cras melius erit quam hodie, id certe.
Now I have no money.	Nunc pecuniam non habeo.
All is well until morning.	Omnia bene usque mane.
Nothing else is always the same.	Nihil aliud semper idem.
I heard so much.	Tantum ego audivi.
You must do something about this.	De hoc tibi aliquid faciendum est.
He was out to do it.	Erat et facere.
You are here now.	Hic nunc es.
This is not possible.	Id fieri non potest.
i hope to be.	spero esse.
But here's something that he can't leave yet.	Sed hic aliquid est quod adhuc relinquere non potest.
I'm just a.	Im sicut a.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
Much better this year.	Multo melius hoc anno.
It is not his.	Non eius.
He thinks something.	Putat aliquid.
None of the above.	Nulla in dictum est.
He also likes it himself.	Etiam id ipsum velit.
They are the same.	Idem sunt.
The teacher is someone really.	Magister est aliquis vere.
Maybe even from before.	Aliquam vel ex ante.
Today everybody does everything.	Hodie omnes facit omnia.
He was a dog.	canis ille erat.
It is not.	Non est.
But this is not necessary.	Sed hoc non est necesse.
Tomorrow is not bad.	Cras non est malum.
The day is not the same now.	Non idem nunc dies.
Good to know how to do it.	Bonum est scire quomodo facere.
Enough for the season.	Satis pro tempore.
Please try again later.	Aliquam a dictum ex.
I've never been here before.	Nunquam hic ante fuit.
He doesn't think about me.	Non me cogitat.
That's how important it was.	Ut dictum magna quam.
I don't like anything.	Non aliquid simile est.
But now we are.	Sed nunc sumus.
Never let it down.	Numquam eam in.
I thought about it.	Cogitavi de eo.
Say yes.	Sic dic.
I had nothing else.	nihil aliud habui.
He did this really well.	Hoc vere bene fecit.
I want to go.	Ire volo.
Truly he did it.	Vere fecit.
No a no	Nulla a nulla.
It is the same.	Simile est illud.
we like it.	eam nobis placet.
It is done.	Factum est.
Maybe this one just isn't for me.	Forsitan hoc unum solum non est mihi.
And that's all about it.	Et quod est de omnibus est ad eam.
That cannot be evil.	Quod malum esse non potest.
My car is gone.	Currus meus abiit.
Your job looks better.	Melius tuum spectat.
Be kind to yourself.	Esse genus ad te.
He saw.	Vidit.
But he could not do this.	Sed hoc facere non potuit.
What is your name?	Quod nomen tibi est?
No, that was great.	Nulla id magna erat.
they are late.	Sero sunt.
Lately he's working so much.	Nuper dixit opus tam valde.
he ate alone.	solus comedit.
A few years ago it was not true.	Ante annos non erat verum.
Breakfast is very good.	Prandium est valde bene.
But he knows he can't.	Sed scit non potest.
As before no.	Ut ante nulla.
He is like you.	Similis est tibi.
It is very nice.	Bene est valde.
There is something true that has been said	Est aliquid verum quod dictum est
You're going to school and do something by yourself.	Ad scholam es, et aliquid a te fac.
This is what you need.	Hoc est quod debes.
and he gave.	et dedit.
I know this is not what you want to hear.	Hoc scio non quod vis audire.
it was much better today.	hodie multo melius fuit.
I know and you know.	scio et scis.
He came from day to day.	De die in diem venit.
This makes it look like nothing has ever been done here.	Hoc facit is vultus ut nihil umquam hic factum sit.
I can't talk right now.	Non possum dicere nunc.
Not even from you.	Ne a te quidem.
That was	Quod erat.
.	.
But it's okay.	Sed bene.
He likes to be willing.	Velit velit.
we have nothing.	nihil habemus.
This is not for me or for me.	Hoc non est ad me, vel ad me.
He is not a man.	Homo non est.
Plus plus plus.	Plus plus plus.
It is he.	Est ille.
You can play with it all you want.	Ludere potes cum hoc omnibus vis.
you have to be.	habes esse.
But it is already done.	Sed iam factum est.
All are well and well.	Bene et bene omnia sunt.
I know that he is.	Scio eum esse.
This ought to be the same.	Idem hic debet esse.
He says nothing wrong with anyone.	Nihil mali de aliquo dicit.
I can't believe it now.	Credere nunc non possum.
It's late in the afternoon.	Sero post meridiem.
That's not for you.	Ut non enim.
We never know what to do.	Numquam nos scire quid faciendum sit.
I have done this before.	Hoc ante feci.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
He can do the same for you today.	Idem tibi hodie facere potest.
And here he is not.	Et hic non est.
For he knew.	Sciebat enim.
This was not true.	Hoc non fuit.
I know how to listen.	quam audire scio.
I can't talk right now.	Non possum dicere nunc.
and he loves her.	et amat eam.
You never said so much to me.	Numquam tantum mihi dixisti.
That was great.	Ut magna erat.
And that indeed.	Et id quidem.
Really good question.	Vere bona quaestio est.
I saw him.	Vidi eum.
I can't leave him.	Eum relinquere non possum.
It was a great deal.	Multum erat.
I like being that way.	Placet esse illo modo.
And he understood that.	Quod et intellexit.
It is not bad.	Non malum.
He refused to stop.	Noluit prohibere.
I doubt, but perhaps.	dubito, sed fortasse.
And it is good.	Et bona est.
I'm glad that I finally did something at home.	Gaudeo quod aliquid domi tandem fecit.
What to do.	Quod ut facias.
But! 	Sed!
at last.	tandem.
But you also are a man.	Sed tu quoque homo es.
She must know what the problem is.	Scire debet quid sit quaestio.
And so he can.	Et sic potest.
But don't say it.	Sed noli id ​​dicere.
He was my father.	pater erat.
He wanted to be a boy.	Ille puer esse voluit.
That's before.	Id ante.
One to one.	Unum ad unum.
You don't want to hear this.	Hoc audire non vis.
I love you too much.	Nimium amo.
You can do whatever you want.	Facere potes quod vis.
But there was no time to talk about this.	Sed de hoc loqui tempus non erat.
I don't think they know anything.	Non puto se quicquam scire.
He doesn't want to go.	Ire non vult.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum enim.
I can't see you.	Te videre non possum.
You can only see it.	Solus eam videre potes.
i can't get it.	habere non possum.
I told you before dinner.	Dixi vobis ante prandium.
as it seems.	ut videtur.
No, always.	Nemo, semper.
But I could not find what he meant.	Sed quid sibi velit invenire non potui.
But it was too late.	Sed nimis sero erat.
I am ready.	paratus sum.
That is, it is difficult.	Id est, difficile est.
This is not going to be enough.	Hoc non satis futurum est.
Well it can be.	Bene potest esse.
Or it could be something else.	Vel potest aliquid aliud.
You have all that we can.	Tibi omnia, quae possumus.
But that's the same thing as that.	Sed id ipsum ut quam.
He was busy.	Erat occupatus.
For you.	Tu enim.
It would seem that this is not so.	Videtur hoc non ita esse.
I thought he was playing so much, and I didn't know better.	Putabam se ludere tantum et melius nesciebam.
I don't know why this is not working.	Nescio cur hoc opus non sit.
Good for us.	Bonum nobis.
For he knew.	Sciebat enim.
I could only do it.	Non potui tantum facere.
That's all.	Quod omnibus est.
I'm trying to do this.	Hoc me facere conatur.
i thought it was a really good job.	Putabam eum vere bonum officium esse.
It is not.	Non eft.
I didn't know you had one.	Nesciebam te unum habere.
He understood that she was.	Intellexit eam esse.
No one was there.	Nulla quis erat.
You can't win.	Vincere non potes.
I want to live here forever.	Hic semper vivere volo.
Don't ever do it again.	Ne umquam me id iterum facias.
You are not yet there.	Nondum ibi es.
I can only speak.	Modo possum dicere.
It was one thing to do.	Erat unum facere.
He loves you enough.	Satis amat te.
Not for a long time indeed.	Non diu quidem.
no one did it.	nemo fecit.
All these things are enough for me!	Satis mihi haec omnia!
and only evil.	et tantum malum.
Or to both.	Vel ad utrumque.
Or so she thought.	Vel sic putavit.
Nothing tonight.	Nihil hac nocte.
It would be fun.	Esset amet.
He is a teacher and loves his job.	Magister est, et officium suum amat.
That is important.	Quod sit amet.
We need more.	Plus nobis opus est.
He was the one who wanted me.	Erat ille qui me velis.
This is not good for me.	Hoc non est bene mihi.
It's really hard to hear this.	Vere difficile est hoc audire.
you're with him.	tu cum eo.
He just didn't know how much.	Ille tantum nesciebat quantum.
No, not.	Non, non.
I feel really bad.	Vere malum sentio.
What time is it today.	Quid est hodie.
I have to tell you this, okay.	Habeo tibi hoc dicere, bene.
But he did this.	Hoc tamen fecit.
I'm glad you're here with me.	Gaudeo te hic mecum esse.
No one said it.	Nemo dixit.
I really just can't get enough.	Ego vere iustus satis non potest.
You can go whatever you want.	Potes ire quod vis.
I just can't get enough.	Ego iustus non potest satis.
We have to do it.	Faciendum nobis est.
Who is the man?	Quis homo.
That he was a father.	Quod esset pater.
I know this is not enough.	Hoc satis non esse scio.
It's never going to happen.	Numquam futurum est.
It is a bad thing to do.	Malum est facere.
I need to talk.	Dicere mihi opus est.
nothing is good nor bad.	nihil est bonum nec malum.
But we are not.	Sed non sumus.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
what a good boy.	Quid puer bonus.
Which he did not.	Quod non fecit.
He could speak to him, but he did not.	Dicere ei potuit, sed non fecit.
I think it's better to leave us here.	Puto hic nos melius relinquere.
I did exactly as you said.	Feci prorsus ut dixisti.
I do not know.	Nescio.
Okay, so there it is.	Bene, sic ibi est.
I did it with him.	Feci cum eo.
To me it is so.	Mihi sic est.
But it seems otherwise.	Sed aliud videtur.
He wanted both of them to be.	Utrumque esse voluit.
That is, he has.	Id est, habet et.
It's really good.	Est vere bonum.
At length he did it.	Tandem fecit.
Do not come.	Noli venire.
They are likely to be friends.	Verisimile sunt amicos esse.
That's a great idea.	Ut in dictum magna.
There was always some time.	Aliquam tempus semper erat.
What was her name.	Quod ei nomen erat.
That was not to be.	Id erat non esse.
Not good.	Nec bonum.
And there is something behind it.	Et aliquid post illud est.
So.	Sic.
Well, no it's not.	Bene, nulla res non est.
I saw myself.	Vidi ipse.
We need to be better.	Melius nobis opus est.
Left behind you right.	Reliquit post te recte.
Hardly have I done it.	Vix id feci.
Yes it is for you.	Sic est tibi.
Yes it is here.	Ita est hic.
Certainly he cannot do this.	Hoc certe facere non potest.
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
But nothing ever.	Sed nihil umquam.
I am sure.	Certus sum.
And in all things.	Et in omnibus.
I thought you too.	Tu quoque cogitavi.
Unless it is.	Nisi id est.
This is what you don't want to do.	Hoc est quod facere non vis.
You're too early.	Nimis mane es.
Ask you if possible.	A te, si fieri potest.
I know so much of the time.	Scio tantum temporis.
.	.
He had no idea he was there.	Nesciebat erat.
You can find someone you like.	Potes aliquem libet.
Maybe it will be a long time.	Forsitan diu erit.
i never heard of him.	numquam de eo audivi.
I am very pleased.	admodum sum.
Make more and more money.	Fac plus et plus pecuniae.
We can't take it anymore.	Accipere non possumus amplius.
It ought to be, but it is not.	Esse debet, sed non est.
Even before him.	Etiam ante ipsum.
No matter, enough.	Nulla res, satis.
I don't always want to.	Ut non semper velit.
They are again this year.	Hoc anno iterum sunt.
Yes that's great.	Etiam id magna.
Maybe not much, maybe long.	Fortasse non multum, fortasse diu.
Tell me something new.	Dic aliquid novi.
But she never told you the truth.	Sed quae numquam tibi verum dixit.
He was already sure.	Iam certus erat.
But neither was he willing.	Sed nec erat velit.
You are so good.	Tam bonus es.
I am not going to do it.	Non facturus est.
This is really a lot for me too.	Hoc vere multum mihi quoque.
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
Nothing new.	Nihil novi.
Nothing yet, but it is still early.	Nihil adhuc, sed mane adhuc est.
he wanted to go to school.	in scholam ire voluit.
This could not have been done.	Fieri quidem non potuit.
That's how good it is.	Id quam bonus est.
I could not do it.	Facere non potui.
Better to cum.	Melius est cum.
I will do the right thing.	Ego rem recte facturus.
He thought he could help.	Putabat se adiuvare posse.
There's no fun in there.	In amet nulla nulla.
and you have.	et habes.
Not sure what to do.	Certo quid facias.
But he was here now.	Sed hic nunc erat.
If you like, we can do it here.	Si libet, possumus hic facere.
Know if anyone loves you.	Scire si quis te amat.
I wish I could not.	Utinam non.
But it is not null.	Sed non nulla est.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
He said it wasn't enough.	Non satis id quidem dixit.
No one wants to do this job.	Nemo vult hoc facere officium.
That was what I needed.	Quod mihi opus esset.
How much money do you have in yourself?	Quantum pecuniae habes in te?
Yes my name.	Ita nomen.
You are tonight.	Tu hac nocte.
I hope you understand and know this.	Spero te intelligere et hoc scire.
you'd like to get one.	ut unus velis.
What is? 	Quid est?
she said.	illa dixit.
All I need is you.	Omnes opus est tibi.
This also seems to happen.	Hoc etiam futurum videtur.
But there is no help.	Sed non est auxilium.
It is not probable.	Probabile non est.
I hope it's good.	Spero bonum.
But yes, he said.	Etiam sed dictum quam.
It is him who	Est qui illum.
This was his day.	Hic dies eius fuit.
If it wasn't your thing, just say well.	Si tua res non fuit, bene dic modo.
Maybe.	Fortasse.
In this it is well.	In hoc bene est.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
These are good things to believe.	Haec sunt bona credere.
As you like.	Ut libet.
I don't want to hear.	Nolo audire.
I know I don't live there anymore.	Scio ibi amplius non vivere.
Unless there is.	Nisi sit.
There was nothing to be done.	Non erat aliquid faciendum.
I'm glad you're finally here.	Gaudeo te tandem hic esse.
I do not know.	Nescio.
Certainly.	Certe.
I don't want to be friends with you.	Nolo esse amicos tecum.
I just heard it lately.	Modo id audivi nuper.
To him in his own way.	Sibi suo modo.
I could not get enough of it.	Satis ex eo non potui.
And this is your business.	Et hic sit amet rem.
I've never seen it before.	Numquam ante vidi.
I know what time is.	Scio quid tempus sit.
Time gave him advice.	Tempus ei consilium dedit.
And of us.	Et de nobis.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
We don't have a lot of time.	Non multum temporis habemus.
It was not enough.	Non satis erat.
You don't have it anymore.	Non habes, amplius.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
We don't need to play better here.	Non opus est nobis hic melius ludere.
He knows it's possible.	Scit posse.
It doesn't seem likely.	Verisimile non videtur.
He wanted this job.	Hoc officium voluit.
The father doesn't quite know what to help.	Pater non satis scit quid adiuvet.
You are a man.	Tu homo est.
There was nothing she could say.	Nihil erat quod dicere posset.
I am, you know.	Ego sum, tu scis.
Do what you do quickly.	Quod cito facias.
It's going to be one year.	Unum annos futurum est.
Now we have him.	Nunc habemus ipsum.
He did not.	Non fecit.
He said nothing.	nihil dixit.
Who knows better.	Melius quis nescit.
I wonder when this will happen.	Miror cum hoc futurum sit.
I don't know how to act now.	Nescio quomodo agere modo.
It will be great to see you.	Magna erit te videre.
I hope you are doing well.	Spero te bene agere.
Too much force for the better.	Nimis vis in melius me habet.
That could be wrong.	Quod posse esse malum.
It was from the Police.	Aliquam a erat erat.
He says nothing.	Nihil dicit.
And so far.	Et quantum.
The film is very happy.	In sit amet ipsum est.
No one has anything.	Nemo quicquam habet.
That was what he wanted.	Ut quis velit erat.
It is with me.	Est mecum.
and.	et in.
To help.	Ad auxilium.
it does not please.	non placet.
There is none but none.	Nulla sed nulla est.
Can't tell me where he is going.	Non potest mihi dicere quo eat.
Exactly this has been said by me.	Prorsus hoc a me dictum est.
I told you not to do this.	Non dixi tibi hoc facere.
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
We'll see again!	Nos certe iterum!.
You are not right.	Non recte.
For years now.	Ad annos nunc.
But it is very important for him.	Sed sit amet enim ipsum.
At this time nothing has been done.	Hoc tempore nihil factum est.
That was kind.	Id genus erat.
I just don't know what to do first.	Nescio modo quid primum facerem.
Do not do it before.	Non ante facias.
She's just gone.	Illa modo abiit.
It was good to see you again.	Bonum erat te iterum videre.
there was so much to do.	tantum erat facere.
And I'm scared too.	Et vix me quoque.
This one's a journey.	Hoc unum est iter.
This is not entirely true.	Hoc non est totum verum.
Truly he saw her.	Vere vidit eam.
Nothing to do with it anymore.	Nihil iam ad rem.
I feel for him.	Ego pro eo sentio.
But what a thing to do.	Sed rem facere quo.
She couldn't think of us at least not to find out.	Posset cogitare nos certe non invenire.
It is not the same today.	Non est hodie idem.
Take a look at either.	Vide ut vel.
But about him a little later.	Sed de illo paulo post.
To-morrow	Cras ut dictum nisi.
I can do the same.	Idem possum.
No as stated.	Nulla ut dictum est.
I could leave now.	nunc relinquere potui.
Something I don't feel right here.	Aliquid hic non recte sentio.
But not enough.	Sed non satis.
You're not there.	Ibi non es.
All but him.	Omnes autem eum.
Thus he did.	Sic fecit.
And he wanted to do something.	Et aliquid facere voluit.
I thought what I was doing.	Cogitavi quid facerem.
You must do this.	Hoc facere debes.
Getting what you think is enough.	Questus quod satis est putas.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
To-morrow in the quarters.	Cras in erat.
I was told yes.	Dictum est mihi quod sic.
I have you.	Habeo te.
And this is enough.	Et hoc satis sit.
Tonight is fine.	Hac nocte bene est.
I was for him.	Ego pro illo essem.
Well done.	Bene fecit.
Both are true.	Utrumque verum est.
He didn't want to know.	Noluit scire.
It is difficult to see.	Difficile est videre.
yes it is not said.	Etiam non dictum est.
I think it's wrong a lot.	Puto malum multum.
I never used to be like this.	Numquam sic solebat.
To be in order.	Esse ut.
Nothing more.	Nihil amplius.
I never wanted you, you know.	numquam te volui, scis.
Wasn't working any time.	Non opus fuit aliquo tempore.
No one wants to hear the truth, but he is here.	Nemo verum audire vult, sed hic est.
And certainly not thinking.	Et certe non cogitas.
That he was the one to do it.	Eum esse illum id.
All of them.	OMNiBus.
I am a man and a man.	Homo sum, et homo.
And he has a wife.	Et habet uxorem.
You are all alone.	Solus es omnes.
It was totally like this.	Prorsus sic erat.
Perhaps better than that.	Melius fortasse quam.
I can't get it.	Non possum hoc accipere.
That is difficult.	Ille difficile est.
Now I can't find it.	Nunc invenire non possum.
This is his plan.	Hoc eius consilium est.
Get some or some from.	Aliquam vel aliquam ex.
He was only in his thirties.	In triginta tantum erat.
Time is not better than now.	Tempus non est melius quam nunc.
I don't need you anymore.	Non opus est tibi amplius.
I am three.	ego tres.
I like being single.	Mihi placet unum esse.
This is a great question.	Magna quaestio haec est.
And he indeed.	Et ille quidem.
It was so.	Sic erat.
Well, my father said.	Bene, pater dixit.
I know we're friends.	Scio nos amicos esse.
I didn't know about all that.	Nesciebam de omnibus quae.
That's before.	Id ante.
He is going to be better for us.	Melius nobis eat.
At last I thought something was going to happen about it.	Putavi tandem aliquid de eo futurum esse.
Make it easy for you.	Fac tibi facile.
It could never happen.	Fieri numquam potuit.
But there is certainly nothing wrong.	Sed certe nihil mali est.
Nothing was at home.	Nihil erat domi.
You can't do much.	Non multum potes.
Thus he said.	Sic ille.
I said so to him.	Ei ita dixi.
And this will be enough.	Et hoc satis erit.
No one knows for sure where his father is.	Nemo certe scit ubi sit pater.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
We are here and we need it.	Hic sumus, et nobis opus est.
It is not so.	Non est ita.
No he is not himself.	Nulla non ipsum est.
Again, too long.	Iterum, nimium diu.
And so too.	Sic quoque.
We are working on this.	Hoc opus sumus.
Don't let anyone either.	Ne quis vel.
May be okay with that.	Sit bene cum.
Which is why it was done.	Quod cur ita factum sit.
Just to know this is not enough.	Hoc solum scire non est satis.
We can't do it.	Non possumus facere.
The job is not easy.	Officium non est facile.
It's not mine.	Meum non est.
He could not go home.	Domum ire non potuit.
I have a better home for you.	Melius habeo domi tibi.
That's what happened today.	Id hodie factum est.
It's time to say the same thing.	Aliquam dictum dictum ipsum.
I like it a lot.	Multum ei placet.
He was with it.	Erat cum id.
And not enough.	Et non satis.
How good is it for you to be here.	Quam bonum est te hic esse.
If you want to do something right, do it yourself.	Si vis aliquid recte fecisse, te ipsum facias.
So let him go.	Sic eat.
What is it? 	Quid est hoc?
I know you better than that.	Novi te melius quam illud.
You can do it for sure.	Pro certo facere potes.
He did not see me.	Non me vidit.
But concerning this.	Sed de hoc.
That's so easy.	Quod tam facile.
There is little time in the day.	Non est parum temporis in die.
He is gone.	Abiit.
You are really good.	Vere bonus es.
It's just a happy one.	Suus 'iustus felix est.
I can't find one.	Unum invenire non possum.
I am not going to do it.	Non sum facturus sit.
Now I have no doubt of him.	Nunc de eo non dubito.
And you have done well.	Et bene fecisti.
We need more.	Plus nobis opus est.
Maybe late last week.	Aliquam septimana nuper.
that I was going to do it.	id me facturum esse.
Well, it's easy.	Bene, facile est.
Or it can be someone at all.	Vel omnino aliquis potest esse aliquis.
There was nothing there.	Nihil ibi erat.
I may not be out right now.	Ut non nunc ex.
In this way he knows.	Hoc modo scit.
ily.	Occurrit.
There will never be more.	Numquam ibi plus erit.
Right, you know.	Recte, scis.
it might be too late.	Sero posset.
But it was not before.	Sed non ante erat.
It's time for us.	Aliquam a nobis.
I do well.	Bene facio.
I know something, but not enough.	Aliquid novi, sed parum.
But it is.	Sed sit.
I am too.	Sum quoque.
That's where I need it.	Id ubi opus est.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
When he comes	Cum venit.
But neither was he willing.	Sed nec erat velit.
He could not.	Non potuit.
Can do pretty much anything.	Satis multa facere potest aliquid.
What he does not want.	Quod non vult.
Certainly not one.	Certe non unus.
No more.	Non amplius.
Which makes it even better.	Quod vel melius facit.
And that was it.	Erat et id.
He could not do it.	Potuit facere.
I never saw anything of it.	Numquam ex illo aliquid vidit.
I have nothing new.	Nihil habeo novi.
but one day it began.	sed unus dies incepit.
Maybe that's something he likes.	Aliquam id aliquam velit.
But you.	Sed tu.
I have it here.	Habeo hic.
He asked him what he wished to do to him.	Quaesivit ab eo quid sibi facere vellet.
It has been too long.	Nimis diu fuit.
It is the same.	Idem est.
It can hardly be seen.	Vix posse videri.
There is still a lot to be done.	Multum adhuc faciendum est.
Or it may seem like this.	Vel sic videri.
I'm not so sure yet.	Non sum tam certus tamen.
There is always something to be able to do.	Semper est aliquid quod facere posset.
That ought to be.	Id esse debet.
There was too much work to do.	Nimium erat opus facere.
It's time to choose.	Aliquam ut velit.
That's great for you.	Ut id magna enim.
I don't even know you here.	Ne hic quidem novi te.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
Even in yourself.	Etiam in te ipsum.
It is enough.	Satis est.
how am I him?	quam ego illum.
He could not do anything with him.	Non potuit facere quicquam cum eo.
Do you want to go?	Visne ire?
I don't really like too much.	Non vere similis nimis.
You just don't need it anymore.	Vos iustus iam non opus est.
To do something.	Faciendum aliquid.
At this time no problem appeared.	Hoc tempore nulla quaestio videbatur.
Well, so he did.	Bene, ita fecit.
It would seem that	Videtur quod.
This is correct.	Recte hoc.
Yes and no.	Etiam et nulla erat.
You can do this too.	Hoc quoque facere potes.
Maybe there was something there, but he didn't see it.	Fortasse aliquid ibi erat, sed non vidit.
I am nothing.	nihil sum.
My father was a teacher.	Pater meus magister fuit.
Do you think you can do something?	Putas te posse aliquid facere!.
It was not before tonight.	Is hac nocte ante non erat.
no.	nulla.
I really didn't know what to think.	Ego vere nesciebam quid cogitare.
But no no here.	Sed non nulla hic.
Don't talk so loud.	Noli tam magna loqui.
Bad advice.	Malum consilium.
What a question.	Quae quaestio.
never knew.	numquam scivit.
I'm not sure what this means.	Quid sibi velit hoc certum non sum.
You should also.	Debes etiam.
It is good.	Bene est.
It's time for you now.	Aliquam a nunc enim.
That was not him.	Ut non erat ipsum.
How long does it take?	Quam diu est hoc accipere?
Looking into the future perhaps not so much.	Vultus in futurum fortasse non tantum.
I want to believe it is.	Credere volo, sic est.
He was at home.	Erat domi.
Really I don't know why.	Vere nescio cur.
You just did it.	Tu modo fecisti.
Which no one knew.	Quod nemo scivit.
At that time.	In illo tempore.
It's his car.	Currus eius est.
It really comes to me.	Is vere ad me venit.
This is.	Hic est.
But this is not true.	Hoc autem non est verum.
We are all very still.	Omnes valde adhuc.
But better than ever.	Sed melius quam semper.
I will not speak here.	Non hic dicam.
And that's the same thing.	Et id ipsum.
Whether he tries to tell him something or not.	Utrum aliquid sibi narrare conatur, necne.
Never been there.	Numquam ibi.
I just didn't know what to do.	Modo nesciebat quid facerem.
Something's wrong.	Aliquid mali.
i never knew.	numquam scivi.
But if.	Sed si.
That's who you are from this day.	Id qui sis ex hoc die.
Better late than never!	Melius sero quam numquam!
I did so.	Ita feci.
There is also another.	Est etiam aliud.
He wanted a house.	Domum voluit.
But either of none.	Sed vel ex nulla.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
I do like this.	Facio placet hoc.
he gave advice.	consilium dedit.
Tomorrow I'm here.	Cras hic sum.
I do the same.	Idem ego.
This was not something.	Hoc non erat aliquid.
I'll tell her now.	Dicam ei modo.
So good to you!!	Sic bene tibi!!.
First, in a.	Primum, a.
Why she refused to speak.	Cur illa noluit dicere.
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
Too busy.	Occupatus.
Never let him down.	Numquam illum.
Now you know where you are.	Nunc scis ubi sis.
As of now, here with you.	Ut nunc, hic tecum.
I wish you well.	Utinam bene.
I will tell you why this is not so.	Quare hoc non ita sit, dicam tibi.
It was, she thought.	Erat, putavit.
But neither is there any.	Sed nec aliquam est.
And if not.	Et si non.
I'm not sure when, but I'm ready.	Non sum certus cum, sed paratus sum.
I know you make one.	Novi te unum facere.
but it is.	id tamen est.
You can live with me.	Apud me vivere potes.
Yes we are.	Ita sumus.
He also doesn't want that.	Etiam non velit quam.
Say what you want, who said what and when.	Dicere vis, qui dixit quid et quando.
But this is not correct.	Sed hoc non recte.
They're great there.	Sunt ibi magna.
It was probably.	Probabiliter fuit.
I am here.	Hic ego sum.
This was not true.	Hoc non erat verum.
Yes, that's what I said.	Etiam id dictum quam.
That's when he was there.	Id cum erat.
There will be no need.	Non erit opus.
It will be great.	Magna erit.
But it was well.	Sed bene erat.
Please don't call me.	Quaeso ne me quidem.
me and you and me and you.	me et me et me et te.
But perhaps something else.	Sed fortasse aliud.
I just couldn't believe myself.	Modo me credere non potui.
And this indeed is correct.	Et hoc quidem recte.
Too much to do, too much to do.	Nimium agere, nimium facere.
She's got one too.	Illa quoque unum obtinuit.
He was alone.	Solus erat.
None of that was more than that.	Nulla id erat quam.
not all at once.	Non omnes simul.
But now there is nothing.	Sed nunc nihil est.
He did not know how he did it.	Nesciebat quomodo fecerit.
Everything will soon come soon.	Omnia mox cito.
But not that way.	Sed non illuc.
I must listen to this.	Hoc audire debeo.
If you get what you want.	Si id quod vis.
must be done.	Faciendum est.
But no no no.	Sed non nulla nulla.
Yes to yourself.	Etiam ut ipsum.
That's only right now.	Id solum nunc.
If you are here.	Si hic es.
You can call me.	Potes me dicere.
But that was going to happen.	Sed id erat futurum.
Everyone is here for something.	Hic omnes ad aliquid est.
I can't have it there today.	Non possum hodie habere eam ibi.
But that was how.	Sed id erat quam.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
But we do nothing.	Sed nobis nihil non.
I was just a boy.	Puer iustus eram.
He looks at me.	Me spectat.
But no one knows how great it is.	Sed quantum sit, nemo novit.
So live yourself.	Ita ipsum vivere.
I don't know how this could be done.	Quomodo id fieri possit, nescio.
Maybe that's too much too.	Nimis fortasse id quoque.
Even before that time.	Etiam id tempus ante.
Both are correct.	Utrumque recte.
yes it is not said.	Etiam non dictum est.
I was only one night.	Una tantum nocte fui.
Even if there is something	Etiam si res est .
I'm good with this.	Sum bonus hoc.
That, we.	Quod, nos.
He's almost ready for nothing.	Fere paratus ille nulla.
I can't really be with him and do a lot of things.	Non possum vere cum illo esse et multum fieri.
Now at least he could not do it.	Nunc certe facere non potuit.
Not me yet.	Non me adhuc.
I think maybe that's what's wrong with me.	Puto fortasse id quid mali me.
But you're not sure how it can be done.	Sed quomodo id fieri possit, non es certus.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
Which of course is none.	Quae quidem nulla.
I want you to find it.	Volo te eam invenire.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
I did not say.	Non dixi.
It's not so bad.	Non ita malum est.
he has enough	satis habet .
I think too much scared.	Vix nimium puto.
And there is more.	Et plus est.
Something needs to be done.	Aliquid necesse est fieri.
I don't want to see it ever again.	Illud semper iterum videre nolo.
It's not that.	Non quod.
I don't need to think, at least it was.	Non opus est cogitare, certe erat.
But time is always zero.	Sed tempus semper nulla.
Maybe that's great.	Aliquam id magna.
This is	Hoc est.
I've never been here before.	Nunquam hic ante fui.
see now.	iam vide.
But he does not wish.	Sed non velit.
I can't see anything save money.	Non potest aliquid videre nisi pecuniam.
Yes we are.	Ita nos.
I never thought it was going to be a job for me.	Numquam putavi officium de me futurum esse.
And this ought not to be done.	Quod quidem fieri non debet.
We can't talk.	Non possumus loqui.
I have time.	tempus habeo.
She wants you home.	Illa te domum vult.
In his own way.	In suum.
I never get to it.	Numquam ad eam.
Now he finally does something.	Nunc aliquid tandem agit.
I don't believe this is enough.	Hoc non credo satis.
You are the only one.	Tu solus es.
I don't have enough time.	Satis temporis non habeo.
Now that's the same thing.	Nunc id ipsum.
This is he.	Hic est ille.
He always speaks.	Semper loquitur.
I'll never do it again.	Numquam id faciam iterum.
That is not very well.	Id est, non optime.
This is not very good, but it is better.	Non est hoc ipsum bonum, sed illud melius.
He knew not to say enough.	Scivit satis non dicere.
From all, all.	Ab omnibus, omnes.
I will not do this.	Non faciam hoc.
I will say something to her.	Dicam aliquid ei eam.
Good to see you.	Bonum est videre te.
You did everything.	Fecisti omnia.
You are not alone in this.	Solus in hoc non es.
She is one of you.	Unus est ex vobis.
It will be fine.	Non bene erit.
I know what he knows.	Scio quod scit.
He knows we don't have.	Ille scit nos non habere.
Now he is gone.	Nunc abiit.
Nothing for you.	Nihil tibi.
I see myself doing a lot of things.	Multum me facere video.
Enough is enough for me.	Satis est mihi satis.
It is.	Dictum est.
And this he says something.	Et hoc dicit aliquid.
He didn't want to be there anymore.	Noluit ibi esse amplius.
You said it to me.	Tu mihi dixisti.
In just as important quickly.	In tam magna cito.
Today not tomorrow.	Hodie non cras.
They don't look too good.	Non vide etiam bonum.
It is not that.	Non est illud.
Now it's yours.	Nunc tuum est.
It is good.	Bene est.
I don't know why.	Quod nescio.
Not only that, but.	Non solum id, sed.
This is another thing to do.	Hoc est aliud facere.
The Father does the same.	Idem facit Pater.
You want to give me great things.	Vis mihi magna dare.
Since.	Ex quo.
It was a bad thing.	Malum erat.
Good to go.	Bonum ire.
I have seen too much.	Nimium enim vidi.
There is no time to think.	Tempus non est cogitare.
Not long.	Non diu.
i think it's easy to get your work done.	ut facile puto te opus esse.
But now I can see.	Nunc tamen videre possum.
And he is not gone.	Et non abiit.
Thus you said.	Sic dixisti.
I don't.	Non facio.
It is not.	Non est.
There are a lot of things.	Non sunt multum.
Maybe it was great.	Aliquam et erat magna.
He didn't want to do that.	Noluit facere.
for he never saw.	nunquam enim vidit.
I don't know what else to say.	Nescio quid aliud dicam.
We are from all.	Ab omnibus sumus.
He knew, and did not do much;	Scivit, et non multum fecit;
You need to understand this.	Hoc debes intelligere.
He came here.	Hic venit.
I don't feel well.	Non bene sentio.
I can't leave it so I don't need it.	Non potest eam relinquere ut non opus sit.
But this does not appear.	Sed hoc non videtur.
Something is not correct.	Aliquid non recte.
Thus he does.	Sic facit.
I don't need to do anything.	Non opus est facere aliquid.
For now there is nothing to do with anything.	Nunc enim nihil ad aliquid.
I don't know much.	Nescio multum.
That's what he wants.	Ut quis velit.
He was really scared.	Vix erat vere.
The matter was the same.	Ita etiam res fuit.
You did not do this.	Hoc facere non fecisti.
I don't know how it was done.	Nescio quomodo factum est.
I told him about you.	ei de te dixi.
This trip is better than the road.	Hoc iter melius est iter.
I want to win today.	hodie vincere volo.
But here only.	Sed hic nisi.
It's not too good.	Non est nimium bonum.
He is not with us anymore.	Non est nobiscum amplius.
he did it himself.	id ipsum fecit.
Now was the time.	Nunc tempus erat.
I'm lucky enough to do the job.	Sum felix satis officium.
You know what happened.	Scis factum esse.
You are not my father.	Non es pater.
It is your job to speak.	Tuum est loqui.
He is no longer a child.	Iam puer non est.
He was absolutely alone.	Omnino solus erat.
I will not.	Nolo.
sorry about that.	quod me paenitet.
This was something more.	Hoc plus aliquid fuit.
It is not always likely.	Verisimile non est semper.
That is, he does not even think of himself.	Id est, ne de se quidem cogitat.
not very good.	Non ipsum bonum.
This is not really what it is.	Hoc non est vere quid est.
I never could speak enough for her.	Numquam satis ad eam loqui potuit.
There was nothing for me to see.	Nihil erat mihi videre.
What a way to do it.	Quid ita sit hoc facere.
Again this is your plan.	Iterum hoc tuum consilium est.
I don't believe it.	Id non credo.
I'll do whatever you like.	Faciam quod libet.
Now it's too much.	Nunc nimium est.
When he wants to be done, he wants it to be done.	Cum vult fieri, vult fieri.
I don't need to play again.	Non opus est iterum ludere.
He could not do this now.	Hoc nunc facere non potuit.
To do and to be.	Facere, et est.
Not when you think.	Non cum cogitas.
That's what we have to do.	Id quod faciendum est.
Money is not always necessary.	Pecuniam habere non semper necesse est.
That's for sure.	Id certe pro.
This is only yours.	Hoc solum est tuum.
But he seems to be doing well.	Sed bene facere videtur.
What he says.	Quid ille dicit.
He seems to have.	Habere videtur.
I want my room.	Cubiculum meum volo.
I could not find him.	Eum invenire non potui.
you have three.	habes tres.
Enough has already been done.	Jam satis est factum.
He was also from him.	Etiam a ipsum erat.
And he was there.	Et ibi erat.
And that's not right now.	Et id non nunc.
You have both.	Habes utrumque.
There was not much to talk about.	Non multum loqui fuit.
With someone, really.	Cum aliquo, vere.
It is important to say great things.	Aliquam sit amet dictum magna.
Perhaps the best.	Optime fortasse.
He refused to do this.	Noluit ei hoc facere.
You.	Sit tibi.
There was nothing there.	Nihil ibi erat.
this is not enough.	ne hoc quidem satis est.
He wanted to go home.	Domum ire voluit.
That's not very well told out.	Optime id non ex eo indicavit.
Nothing can be done.	Fieri nihil potest.
It's time to do something.	Aliquam vel aliquam ipsum.
But even without me it would have been.	Sed vel sine me futurum erat.
So do this.	Sic fac hoc.
But it is not easy.	Sed non facile.
But this is not at all.	Sed hoc omnino non est.
Well, here it is.	Bene, hic est.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
What has been said	Quod dictum est.
You can do this one at home, people.	Hoc unum facere potes domi, homines.
Maybe that's it.	Aliquam id est ut.
Paul.	Paulo.
we have by.	habemus per.
You can never win.	Numquam vincere potes.
I can't stop thinking about you.	Non possum prohibere cogitas te.
Do what you need to do.	Fac quod debes facere.
This is what he said.	Hoc genus est, quod dixit.
We're all the same, after all.	Omnes sumus idem, post omnes.
No it's none of it.	Nulla id nulla enim.
He never has me.	Numquam me habet.
Or a.	Vel a.
It is for sure.	Est certe.
Yes it is where we are, man.	Ita est ubi sumus, homo.
No one knew where he was.	Nemo scivit ubi esset.
Not here.	Non hic.
I'm not sure about this.	De hoc non sum certus.
It looks good.	Non spectat bonum.
the future I wanted.	futurum volui.
Great to see that.	Magna videre quod.
When he went away, he went away.	Cum abiit, abiit.
I want to do this as much as possible.	Hoc volo quantum facit.
We can do nothing now.	Nihil nunc facere possumus.
Now you know why.	Nunc cur scis.
It is done.	Factum est.
Well, not alone.	Bene, non solus.
I choose that too.	Libet id quoque.
That's it.	Ut id est est.
Not even one.	Ne unum quidem.
Nothing was said in it.	Nulla in dictum erat.
As much as you like.	Quantum libet.
There is no such thing.	Nulla id ipsum.
i was still in school.	adhuc in schola fui.
This cannot be enough.	Hoc satis esse non potest.
He had nothing wrong to say about him.	Nihil mali habuit de eo dicere.
Make time for it.	Fac illud tempus.
What a good time.	Quod tempus bonum.
Everyone knew what he had to talk to.	Sciebat omnes quod habuit ei loqui.
I would not do this to you.	Nolui hoc tibi.
I don't need you	Non opus est tibi .
You never did.	Numquam fecisti.
There will be no more.	Non erit amplius.
That's how often.	Saepe id quam.
And in this way	Et hoc modo.
He just loves me.	Mox amat me.
But that was what it was.	Sed id erat erat.
Even if it was not attempted.	Etiam si conatus non esset.
It was probably all.	Verisimiliter omnibus erat.
It is difficult to speak.	Difficile est loqui.
It could not have been better.	Melius esse non potuit.
She came to tell me.	Venit illa dic mihi.
But that's never to be.	Sed id numquam ut.
He could do everything.	Posset omnia.
I really like it.	Ego vere amo eam.
If not, do it.	Si non est, illud fac.
There is no evidence of any kind.	Nulla id aliquam ex.
It is necessary that both be together.	Necesse est ut utrumque simul.
He told me something was in him.	Aliquid mihi dixit se in eo esse.
i'm busy today.	occupatus sum hodie.
Let it be there.	Sit ibi.
The plan was the same.	Consilium idem fuit.
That's some very good thing.	Ut id aliquam ipsum.
But not before him.	Sed nec ipsum ante.
It is very hard work and I'm getting it.	Nimis difficile est opus et me questus est.
I'm sorry about this.	De hoc me paenitet.
He has a dog.	Canem habet.
This is not what he does.	Hoc non est quod facit.
He knew he would leave.	Sciebat se relinquere.
What is possible?	Quid fieri potest?
I knew indeed.	Sciebam quidem.
Time fixed.	Tempus certum.
The boy is not the same today.	Puer non est ipse hodie.
There is little to do.	Facere parum est.
He knew that we were him.	Sciebat nos eum fuisse.
I tried everything to stop him from starting out.	Conatus sum omnia ab eo proficisci prohibere.
Maybe we can help.	Forsitan nos adiuvet.
Something fun to do.	Aliquid amet facere.
This is not possible.	Hoc fieri non potest.
This is the same for my book.	Hoc ipsum ad librum meum.
Not so much today.	Tantum non hodie.
If it were, he would do it all.	Si esset, omnes faceret.
That's your plan.	Quod tuum est consilium.
I could not say enough.	Non potui satis dicere.
it was only.	id esset solum.
To-morrow it was said.	Cras id dictum est.
That is not the case now.	Quod iam non est.
Maybe not never.	Aliquam non numquam.
He does not come to me.	Non venit ad me.
You don't have to accept.	Non habes accipere.
It was so much more than that.	Tantum erat multo plus quam illud.
It is nothing you can think of.	Simile est nihil cogitare potes.
I love this season.	Hoc tempore amo.
There was no need to say.	Nihil opus erat dicere.
I really like to see that.	Ego vere amo video esse.
Take a look at it.	Vide eam.
We still have some time.	Adhuc aliquid temporis habemus.
I'm going right now.	Eo nunc.
I think that's great.	Id puto magna.
Soon all.	Mox omnes.
Something's wrong here.	Aliquid hic mali est.
Yes that always is.	Etiam id semper est.
He could not.	Non potuit.
I know this for sure.	Hoc satis certo scio.
Well done that's going to happen.	Bene factum est ut futurum sit.
No that is none.	Nulla id est nulla.
I don't know why he did it.	Nescio cur id fecerit.
He is ready to go.	Paratus est ire.
Yes, it is yours.	Ita est, tuum factum est.
He would not.	Noluit.
And perhaps rightly so.	Et fortasse recte.
That's kind of it.	Id genus est.
Not even this.	Non hoc etiam.
He came and went.	Venit et abiit.
That is possible.	Quod fieri potest.
This was not my plan.	Non erat hoc consilium meum.
No likely to win.	Verisimile nulla vincere.
This is different.	Hoc aliud est.
You are not there.	Non ibi.
Most likely correct.	Verisimile recte.
It seems that you are right.	Videtur quod tu recte.
You can hear your voice now.	Potes nunc tuum audire.
No one does it himself.	Nemo id ipsum.
None but great.	Nulla a nisi magna.
No no, no.	Non non, non.
I have a lot to say to you.	Multum habeo tibi dicere.
We can leave early.	Mane relinquere possumus.
It will be better for all.	Melius erit omnibus.
Yes, perhaps the same thing.	Etiam fortasse ipsum.
It will be only tonight.	Hoc modo in hac nocte erit.
I know better now.	Melius nunc scio.
I do not doubt.	Non dubito.
I just don't believe that.	Modo non credo.
It was done there.	Ibi factum est.
He knows that he can.	Scit se posse.
He's just the kind of guy.	Ille iustus est genus guy.
That can't be good.	Quod bonum esse non potest.
That's a lot of time.	Ut sit amet tempus est.
I didn't understand the problem.	Quaestionem non intellexit.
As stated above or none at all.	Ut vel dictum nulla.
Tomorrow is important.	Cras sit amet.
I wanted both.	utrumque volui.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
If you can't find it.	Si invenire non potes.
FATHER AND	PATER ET .
It's fine now.	Bene nunc est.
I think you can do it.	Puto te facere non posse.
But not for long.	Sed non diu.
Even when there was a problem, the job was never done correctly.	Etiam cum quaestio erat, officium numquam recte factum est.
I just didn't.	Ut nec nunc.
Nothing in, nothing out of it.	Nihil in, nihil ex.
perhaps too much.	fortasse nimis.
I hope you're doing well.	Spero te bene.
I will do it again.	Iterum faciam.
It's never to do it.	Est id facere numquam.
Yes that's nice.	Etiam id nisi.
I don't know nothing.	Nescio nihil.
I am already behind.	Jam post cur- sum.
But to do it quickly is not easy.	Sed facere cito non est facile.
I doubt it will happen.	Dubito futurum.
And that is.	Et ut est.
The question is why.	Quare etiam quaestio est.
The guy does the job.	A guy quod officium facit.
This is not possible.	Hoc fieri non potest.
But it seems hard to do.	Sed difficile videtur facere.
No one tried to talk to him.	Nemo ex eo loqui conatus est.
But, as has been said, he wants some.	Sed ut dictum est, id aliquam velit.
I'm going to school.	Eo scholam.
But before	Sed ante.
A lot.	Sit amet.
Too bad it has been done.	Nimis malum factum est.
I just can't.	Modo non potest.
You think he did it.	Putas fecit.
in or before.	In vel ante.
Please be happy for me, not my husband.	Sis felix est mihi, non vir meus.
I've never seen anything like it.	Nunquam quicquam simile vidi.
Just as important.	Tam magna.
He had a house there.	Domum ibi habuit.
Seems like you don't have much else to do.	Videtur aliud facere non multum.
More than he wanted to do.	Plus quam hoc facere voluit.
Not that day.	Non illo die.
And there it is.	Et sit.
If it was great.	Si magna erat.
You're on our way.	Pro nobis es iter.
It's a matter of him.	Est rem illum.
and so he does.	et sic facit.
You can come here.	Potes huc venire.
I tried to think about what to say.	Conatus est cogitare quid dicam.
He knew that it was hard for him.	Id difficile sibi esse sciebat.
Both are necessary.	Utrumque opus est.
He seemed neither to hear nor to hear.	Nec audire nec audire videbatur.
I am the only one who can do it.	Solus sum qui id facere potest.
I was alone here.	Solus hic fui.
It's morning, so it's still time.	Mane est, sic est adhuc tempus.
He likes either.	Velit vel.
I tried to know what to say.	Conatus sum scire quid dicam.
I can't talk to you right now.	Non possum dicere tibi nunc.
I am still the same.	ego ipse adhuc.
all but three.	omnes, sed tres.
I think that's something to know.	Puto id aliquid scire.
Perhaps this is possible.	Forsitan id fieri potest.
It is not easy.	Non facile.
I didn't know what to do!	Quid facerem nesciebam!
But so it was done.	Sed ita factum est.
He just wants to talk.	Loqui iustus velit.
You are great.	Magna id es.
That's all.	Totum id.
He did not know that he was going to do so.	Nesciebat se facturum esse.
you need to know how to do it.	opus est scire quomodo id fecerit.
But tell me about you.	Sed dic mihi de te.
He would not listen.	Noluit audire.
More than that.	Plus quam illa.
And he can live well.	Et bene vivere potest.
You can do more than you can.	Plus potes quam potes.
What do you want?	Quod quid vis?
This one is for us.	Hoc unum est nobis.
Or not.	Vel non.
She just knew to be there.	Illa modo scivit ibi esse.
Yes, that's a great time.	Etiam id tempus magna.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
But that time was not him but his.	Sed id tempus erat, non ipsum sed eius.
i haven't done this ever well.	non feci id bene semper.
don't like me.	Non placet mihi.
Here where he left.	Hic ubi ille reliquit.
I see it.	eam video.
I want this.	Hoc volo.
Too soon, and far too soon.	Cito nimis, et nimis cito.
Maybe you don't like it.	Fortasse non placet.
it was his.	eius erat.
Something.	Aliquid.
I tried to do something like that.	Conatus sum facere aliquid simile hoc.
Know when to say yes, and when to say not.	Scire cum dicere etiam, et quando dicere non.
I haven't started to talk.	Non incepit loqui.
It is.	Sic est.
But this seems to have happened.	Quod tamen factum videtur.
That's what I did before.	Ut id quam ante.
I don't want that either.	Nolo id quidem.
You can have a house.	Potes habere domum.
He thought he had done it.	Putabat se fecisse.
I hope I'm going to do this.	Spero me hoc facturum esse.
It was not done at this time.	Non hoc tempore factum est.
and he already knew what it was.	et iam sciebat quid esset.
It was something else.	Aliud erat.
He owes him a little something.	Debet paulo aliquid ei.
I heard myself.	Audivi ipse.
I did not know.	Nesciebam.
He did not know who the man was.	Nesciebat quis homo esset.
Office, duty.	Officium, officium.
You really need to know.	Vere scire debes.
He can do it.	Facere possit id.
Everything was here and there.	Omnia hic fuit et est.
This is true.	Is est vere.
No one knew how much.	Nemo, quantum sciebat.
If you do this, do not stop.	Si hoc feceris, noli prohibere.
None of the above.	Nulla a dictum.
Not well.	Nec bene.
But not the time itself.	Sed non tempus ipsum.
You have help.	Habes auxilium.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
It will not always be.	Non semper erit.
There is!	Ibi est!
I've done it.	Ego feci.
It is important for you.	Aliquam sit amet enim est.
but they are there.	sed sunt ibi.
That's not great.	Ut non magna.
I never thought that	Numquam putabat.
There is nothing wrong with me.	Nihil mihi mali est.
I think she loves you a little.	Puto te parum amat.
My father was there.	Pater meus ibi erat.
There is almost nothing.	Nihil fere est.
I'm glad to hear this.	Gaudeo hoc audire.
But this is enough.	Sed hoc satis est.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
But that is not now.	Sed id iam non est.
I don't want her job.	Nolo officium eius.
This is definitely how it looks.	Hoc certe est quomodo spectat.
Maybe or some great things.	Aliquam vel aliquam magna.
And it should not be.	Et non debet.
He likes nothing more than himself.	Nihil plus vult ad ipsum.
I hope you find something too!.	Spero te quoque aliquid invenire!.
I see that you need my help.	Video te mihi auxilio opus esse.
Which has not been rightly said.	Quod non recte dictum est.
Really just hard.	Vere iustus difficile.
This was great.	Hic magna erat.
Really don't know what to do.	Vere nescio quid faciam.
I wanted to do it again.	Iterum facere volui.
It was not going to happen.	Non erat futurum.
It is not for me.	Non est mihi.
His job is to do so.	Eius officium est id.
Yes it is now.	Ita nunc est.
Never stop coming.	Numquam prohibere venire.
sorry for being so late.	Paenitet tam sero.
Deals.	Agit.
It's not good at all.	Non bene omnino est.
I don't have a lot of money.	Non multum pecuniae facio.
I am one.	unus sum.
He was not a good father either.	Non erat bonus pater, vel.
He comes to you.	Venit ad te.
He wanted to do this.	Hoc facere voluit.
He is my dog.	Canis meus est.
That was most likely.	Id verisimile erat.
Don't talk about it.	Non de hoc loqui.
Or almost everyone.	Vel fere omnes.
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum est.
It was yours.	Tuum fuit.
I never saw a book so hard.	Numquam librum tam difficile vidi.
There he was.	Ibi eum.
This is very kind.	Valde hoc genus.
You need to know what you want.	Vis scire debes.
This cannot be true.	Hoc non potest esse verum.
It's something else.	Est aliquid aliud.
That's more concern.	Id plus spectat.
Which he did not.	Quod non fecit.
Everything you can think of.	Omnia potes cogitare.
No, neither could he.	Non, nec potuit.
This, however, could not be done.	Hoc tamen fieri non potuit.
It was too much to go through.	Nimium erat ut in.
But I believe it can be done.	Sed fieri posse credo.
what's the job.	Quid est officium.
For he knew that he did not.	Sciebat enim quod non.
See you now.	Vide modo te.
but it will be late.	sed sero erit.
But you have it.	Sed id habes.
Maybe not, but	Aliquam non, sed.
You cannot understand.	Non potes intelligere.
and yet he is here.	et tamen hic est.
But this is difficult.	Hoc tamen difficile est.
I thought that would happen.	Putavi fore.
Not sure what's the matter.	Certo quid ad rem.
For he does something.	Ipse enim aliquid facit.
Certainly you don't want to see it.	Certe non vis eam videre.
None but said save.	Nulla sed dictum nisi.
Your work alone.	Tuum solum opus.
You want to see us.	Vis videre nos.
I have it for sure.	Pro certo habeo.
Never a problem with that.	Numquam quaestio ex cum.
don't like me.	Non placet me.
I'm just saying that.	Im 'iustus dicere posse.
And there was only one.	Erat autem una tantum.
That's not even enough.	Ne id quidem satis.
It is certain.	Certum est.
One and one are three.	Unum et unum sunt tres.
I need you after all.	Opus est tibi cum omnibus.
Too much.	Nimium.
But I don't like here.	Sed non ut hic.
But that was the same.	Sed id erat ipsum.
I couldn't think of anything to say.	Non potuit cogitare quid dicam.
Not as he expected.	Non ut putabat.
He was really scared.	Vix vere erat.
Yes, but that's great.	Etiam id nisi magna.
There was none at all.	Nulla a nulla erat.
I don't think it's easy.	Non facile puto.
But I can't find it.	Sed id invenire non possum.
And there is more.	Et plus est.
I'm lucky to be here.	Sum felix hic esse.
I have heard.	Audivi.
But this is bad.	Hoc tamen malum.
i have to stay.	habeo manere.
I believe you are good.	Credo te esse bonum.
It's not about you.	Hoc non est de te.
It's okay.	Est bene.
he is not here.	non est hic.
I knew that it was true.	verum esse sciebam.
He knew it was going to be a long time.	Sciebat diu futurum esse.
You can't have nothing.	Nihil habere non potes.
It's time to get some out of it.	Aliquam non aliquam ex.
Which indeed was true.	Quod quidem verum erat.
He cannot see.	Videre non potest.
It would seem that it is not.	Videtur quod non.
But that is difficult.	Sed id difficile est.
It was already there.	Jam illud erat.
That says a lot.	Quod multum dicit.
I wish I wasn't in the race.	Genus utinam non.
But he says nothing.	Sed nihil dicit.
But to be different is not evil.	Esse autem aliud non est malum.
I need some help.	Opus est aliquo auxilio.
It's too late for you now.	Non nimis sero est tibi nunc.
She has to know that she is there.	Illa scire se esse ibi habet.
Always to him.	Semper ad eum.
I can't say enough good things.	Non possum satis bona dicere.
I know too much.	nimium scio.
He didn't seem to say much else.	Non multum aliud dicere videbatur.
You are not right.	Non recte.
I want you to talk about me.	Volo enim vos loqui pro me.
This is entirely true.	Hoc omnino verum est.
And you can.	Et potes.
You can see today.	Potes hodie videre.
That's still not right.	Id tamen non recte.
Now that's none.	Nunc ut nulla est.
Something here is not at all true.	Aliquid hic non omnino verum est.
It was good to see.	Bonum erat videre.
He did not understand.	Non intellexit.
Yes there is a question.	Ita est quaestio.
But it was not the same.	Sed non ipsum erat.
You can't do both.	Utrumque facere non potes.
But not before.	Sed nec ante.
He, id.	Ille, id.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
To or unless he wants.	Ut vel nisi velit.
What is to be done.	Quid sit faciendum.
Definitely a dog.	Canem Certus.
We do it for us.	Facere nobis sit nobis.
I just don't want to.	Ut non velit.
To do something, to do nothing.	Facere aliquid, nihil facere.
I don't need it this morning.	Non opus est hoc mane.
It doesn't mean to be hard.	Non vult esse difficile.
The matter was.	Res erat.
Maybe not for you.	Fortasse non te.
Almost from the above.	Fere dictum ex.
i feel good.	bene sentio.
From this, whether or not who comes or not.	Ex hoc necne quis venit necne.
I think I can see where it is going.	Videre puto quo id eat.
he said so quickly.	tam cito dixit.
You're already ready.	Iam paratus es.
You do what you need to do.	Facis quod debes facere.
But never do it.	Sed numquam id.
I have seen myself.	Ego ipse vidi.
Yes it certainly was with me.	Ita certe apud me fuit.
There will be.	Ibi erit.
I didn't appreciate him.	Non eum bene.
He did, you know.	Fecit, scis.
But she is not busy.	Sed non est occupatus.
It's time to save that.	Aliquam id nisi quam.
I know for sure he will do well.	Bene facturum certo scio.
I never even asked about it.	Numquam me quidem de eo quaesivit.
But that's none of it.	Sed id ipsum nulla.
And yet he came to him.	Et adhuc venit ad eum.
Now you are the one who can help me.	Nunc tu es ille qui me adiuvet.
I hope that is so.	Spero quod ita est.
Take a look at the book and you want to see the product.	Vide librum et vis videre opus.
It's not that much.	Non hoc multum est.
You know now.	Scis nunc.
So he has.	Ita habet.
I hope people like it.	Spero homines placet.
but i feel much better.	sed multo melius sentio.
He does it often.	Facit saepe.
Which indeed is true.	Quod quidem verum est.
And the man went after her.	Et abiit vir post eam.
It's time to go no save.	Aliquam ut nulla nisi.
Get somebody from yourself.	Ut quis ex ipsum.
I have never done this before.	Numquam ante id.
I'm so late to work.	Im tam sero ad opus.
He had a job to do.	Habuit officium facere.
What must I do?	Quid necesse est me hoc facere?
He doesn't have you.	Non habet te.
Probably not coming.	Probabiliter non venit.
Don't go for a bad job indeed.	Ne pro male quidem.
Surely this can be done.	Certo id fieri potest.
See why not so much.	Vide, cur non tantum.
I'm not the same right now.	Non sum ipse nunc.
Now he knew he wanted something more.	Iam sciebat se plus aliquid velle.
I don't know what it is all about.	Nescio quid sit de omnibus.
You have done very well.	Optime fecisti.
As always before.	Ut id semper ante.
You can be alone.	Tu solus potes esse.
It was said too much.	Dictum erat nimium.
But it looks good to me.	Sed mihi bene spectat.
It's not why we're here.	Non est cur hic sumus.
I could do nothing.	nihil potui.
And that's it.	Id autem est.
The matter was.	Res erat.
Much the same thing.	Idem multa.
If anyone can find him.	Si quis eum invenire potest.
I feel nothing for him.	Nihil pro eo sentio.
But that's always zero.	Sed id semper nulla.
Tomorrow or	Cras vel.
Not sure about that.	Non certus quod.
We don't do nothing.	Nos nihil non.
I don't always love him.	Ut non semper ipsum.
Nor yet.	Nec tamen.
The thing is you can do it.	Res est potes.
No one is here.	Hic nemo.
Nothing to do yet.	Nihil facere id tamen.
And he knew it.	Sciebat autem.
No one wants to think about it.	Nemo de illo cogitare vult.
A guy who doesn't.	A guy qui non facit.
But he would not speak of that day.	Sed de illo die loqui noluit.
Both are great things.	Ambo magna res est.
These things he said.	Haec ille.
They were both great.	Ambo magna.
This is not working for me.	Hoc mihi non opus est.
He could not do this much longer.	Hoc multo diutius facere non potuit.
You forgot tonight.	Hac nocte oblitus es.
But I don't have time now.	Sed non tempus nunc.
These things are.	Haec sunt.
For that's what.	Id enim.
He knows we're here.	Scit hic sumus.
However, he did not give.	Tamen non dedit.
No one saw her.	Nemo vidit eam.
It was a great week for us.	Erat magna hac septimana nobis.
And if more than .	Et si plus quam .
He could do better.	Melius facere potuit.
If you want to say something, say it.	Si vis aliquid dicere, dic.
You need a lot of work to do.	Multum opus hoc facere debes.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
I think they believe too much.	Puto se nimium credere.
Not yet.	Non tamen.
But he wants more than that.	Sed velit quam.
I would not do this.	Hoc nolui.
i can and i want.	possum et volo.
I can't understand you.	Non possum intelligere te.
He ought to know.	Scire debet.
It would not be too hard.	Ne nimis difficile esset.
which I never knew.	quod numquam sciebam.
My dad is scared of him.	Meus illum pater vix.
He said that it was well.	Bene esse dixit.
I hope I see you as !.	Spero te sicut video!.
He willed, and alone.	Voluit, et solus.
All is well.	Omnia bene.
She really likes to travel.	Illa vere vult ad iter.
I didn't want to do it.	Me id facere noluisse.
As it was said.	Ut dictum erat erat.
Watch the video here in this post.	Hic video, in hac post.
I have done nothing wrong.	Nihil mali feci.
in or out of.	In vel ex.
But still nothing.	Sed adhuc nihil.
But it is not great.	Sed non magna est.
I've been here before.	Fui hic ante.
She told me that she was.	Illa mihi dixit se esse.
Doing the job for you.	Faciens officium tibi.
He saw now.	Vidit nunc.
You're sure you don't want to.	Certus es non vis .
But to do the job.	Sed facere officium.
This is easy.	Hoc facile est.
I saw someone.	Vidi aliquem.
We are where we are.	Ubi sumus, sumus.
We are never good enough for him.	Numquam satis eius sumus.
Not even this whole thing.	Ne hoc quidem totum.
Comes to lunch.	Venit ad prandium.
That's with him.	Id cum eum.
with each other.	Cum inter se.
This is not seen.	Hoc non videtur.
Tomorrow is important.	Cras sit amet.
Nothing does not exist.	Nihil non.
It was true, it is.	Verum erat, est.
I have seen the truth.	verum vidi.
To have only, but still so little.	Habere tantum, sed tamen ut parum.
I just didn't know what to do.	Modo nesciebat quid hoc facere.
You are not.	Non tu.
Yours will be mine.	Tuum erit tibi meum.
He says as much as possible.	Dicit quantum.
He even said he didn't want to.	Etiam nec dictum velit.
You are mine.	Meum est tibi malum.
I never knew I needed it.	Numquam sciebam opus esse.
Not much anymore.	Non multum amplius.
You'll never do that.	Numquam id facere.
But I got it was too much.	Sed obtinuit ut nimium esset.
Not well.	Non bene.
A man cannot be what he wills.	Non potest homo esse quod vult.
He is only a boy.	Puer tantum est.
He is gone.	Abiit.
I'm not surprised you're saying nothing.	Non miror te nihil dicere.
I thought I would do it this way.	Putavi hoc modo facturum esse.
But it was not the same.	Sed non ipsum erat.
She speaks really like this.	Illa vere sic loquitur.
But that's how.	Sed id quam quam.
As he did.	Sicut et fecit.
Not well.	Non bene.
Make money.	Fac pecuniam.
But something else.	Sed aliud quid.
In the morning	Mane.
He comes to me.	Venit ad me.
I want to see you.	Volo te videre.
He did not know where he was.	Nesciebat ubi esset.
To save this time.	Ut id tempus nisi.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Maybe in a great way.	Aliquam in magna quam.
That was still there.	Quod erat, adhuc est.
I've never been here before.	Nunquam hic ante fui.
Well, not one at all, but certainly a lot like one.	Bene, non omnino unum, sed certe multum simile unum.
And he says you're still here.	Et hic dicit te esse adhuc.
not by that.	Non eo.
I'm too tense.	Nimium temporis sum.
That's too bad.	Quod nimis malum est.
At that time he said little.	Per tempus illud parum dixit.
If he were, he would do more for me.	Si esset, plus mihi faceret.
No it's from some.	Nulla a aliquam est.
You can't do this.	Hoc facere non potes.
Maybe he did it.	Fortasse fecit.
This is going wrong.	Hoc eat malum.
Maybe.	Forsitan.
I don't travel.	Non iter.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
Nothing is there, nor does it seem to you in this way.	Nihil est, nec tibi videtur hoc modo.
Not for me, but.	Non mihi, sed.
But the future.	Sed futurum.
I'm not sure what to do.	Quod facere non certus sum.
But what if	Sed quid si .
But there is in and out of some something.	Sed in est et ex aliquam aliquam.
Much better.	Multo melius.
That is not true.	Quod non est.
It was always the last time.	Proximo tempore semper fuit.
He never came.	Numquam venit.
and he did not know well.	et non bene sciebat.
But that's now out of nowhere.	Sed id nunc ex nulla.
I can help.	Ego potest auxilium.
I don't think much has been said by you.	Non multum a te dictum puto.
Who said you could come here?	Quis tibi dixit huc venire posse?
I love it when we are three.	Amo, cum sic tres sumus.
yes it is not said.	Etiam non dictum est.
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
But that is none.	Sed id nulla est.
Not well.	Non bene.
perhaps there was none.	fortasse nulla fuit.
But that's what he wants.	Sed id velit quam.
we can't find it.	invenire non possumus.
No one knew we were there.	Nemo scivit nos ibi fuisse.
That's good.	Id bonum est.
I thought I could live this.	Putabam hoc posse vivere.
I travel a lot.	Ego multum iter.
I really wanted nothing more.	Ego vere amplius nihil volui.
He came also.	Venit etiam.
You should definitely go.	Certe ire debes.
That's your race.	Id tuum genus est.
I don't know anything else to tell you.	Non novi aliud tibi dicere.
He loves us.	Ipse nos amat.
It is easy to say so.	Facile est ita loqui.
I know his first name.	Primum nomen eius scio.
He is not talking to him.	Is non ei loquitur.
This is what you want to do today.	Hoc hodie vis facere.
He thinks like a man does.	Cogitat sicut homo facit.
Or, you want help.	Vel, vis auxilium.
All we need to do.	Omnia nobis opus est facere.
As my father thought.	Ut pater putavit.
But that was difficult.	Sed id erat difficile.
Don't get sick.	Non male.
You need to know.	Scire debes.
Not so here yet.	Non ita est hic tamen.
I am not a morning person.	Non sum mane homo.
There will only be more.	Plus solum futurum est.
I think it is, but perhaps not at all.	Puto esse, sed fortasse non omnibus.
Yes, but it was always.	Etiam sed semper erat.
I don't feel so.	Ita non sentio.
There is none.	Nemo est.
Very, very well.	Valde, optime.
You can't leave us.	Nos relinquere non potes.
I want something else to talk about.	Volo aliquid aliud loqui.
He is the same.	Idem ille.
Well it is and it is not.	Bene est et non est.
Now it was really in season.	Nunc vere erat in suo.
But that said nothing.	Sed id dictum nulla.
We do something a little different.	Nos aliquid aliud paulo.
And it was not hard to find.	Et non fuit difficile invenire.
I can do better than you.	Melius possum facere quam tu.
He says so much.	Multum sic dicit.
For his help.	Pro eius auxilio.
Maybe who it was.	Aliquam quis erat.
But there was no time.	Sed tempus non erat.
This is not good, but it seems good enough.	Hoc non est bonum, sed satis videtur.
badly done.	male factum est.
No one really wants to do this.	Nemo vere hoc facere vult.
Never say you're good.	Numquam tibi dicere nimium bona est.
I don't mean to see you.	Non vult te videre.
It is not difficult.	Non difficile est.
Look for you.	Vide tibi.
Now this is enough.	Hoc nunc satis est.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
Yes, but there was some.	Etiam sed aliquam erat.
Not so much anymore.	Non tam amplius.
I love this house.	Hanc domum amo.
This is what you want.	Hoc est quod vis.
This work is done.	Hoc opus est.
Here, so.	Hic, sic.
and he has a name.	et nomen habet.
Even your car is not new.	Etiam currus te non novi.
He just can't.	Iustus non potest.
You don't have.	Non habes.
Yes it is now.	Ita nunc est.
They are not and never will be.	Non sunt et numquam.
You did not say.	Non dixisti.
It looks that way.	Eo modo spectat.
He really didn't want to be here.	Vere hic esse noluit.
Certainly he has.	Certe habet.
If there is one thing.	Si qui res.
To all, to all.	Omnibus, omnibus.
He indeed.	Ipse quidem.
You can't be both.	Utrumque esse non potes.
But not only.	Sed non nisi.
I guess he's the only one.	Suspicor hic solus unus.
He looks at me right now.	Me nunc spectat.
No one looks any more.	Nemo plus spectat.
No not here.	Non non hic.
I can not.	Non possum.
But you can see.	Sed videre potes.
", it was."	', fuit'.
Soon no one is talking to me anymore.	Mox nemo mecum amplius loquitur.
when that's great.	Cum id magna.
We all	Omnes nos .
I'll do it tomorrow morning.	Cras mane Faciam.
I like to believe this.	Mihi placet credere quod est.
But you're very good.	Sed tu ipsum bonum.
To be very happy.	Ut sit amet ipsum est.
But he will not.	Sed non vult.
I could not make it.	Non potui eam.
I don't know what will happen.	quid futurum sit nescio.
He does not do so.	Non sic facit.
The work was easy.	Facile erat opus.
And indeed so.	Et quidem ita.
No one can do anything here.	Aliquid hic nemo facere potest.
They are evil.	Mali sunt.
Yes it is, it is not.	Ita est, non est.
You'd better go without us.	Melius nobis sine te ire velis.
Little did he understand.	Parum intellexit.
I want something else.	Volo aliquid aliud.
I was there and I did it.	Fui ibi et feci hoc.
He told me that he could not stay longer.	Dixit mihi se diutius manere non posse.
Today was our day.	Hodie nobis dies erat.
It is not possible, however.	Non potest, sed.
I know that's not a thing.	Scio rem non esse.
Maybe it's time.	Aliquam id tempus est.
and they are.	et sunt.
But it is.	Sed sit.
I'm gonna buy more.	Plus amet mihi emere.
I don't know why he did it.	nescio cur id fecerit.
for what ever?	quid enim umquam?
Everything is behind me now.	Omnia post me nunc est.
This is true in all things.	Verum hoc in omnibus.
But nothing.	Sed nihil.
This is the case.	Hoc ita se habet.
It will be better soon.	Nunc mox melius erit.
He doesn't want to do it.	Non vult facere.
No, perhaps you'd better not.	Non, fortasse melius non velis.
He can't do this.	Hoc facere non potest.
I would not hear.	Nolui audire.
To do as he pleases.	Facere ut velit.
So he was with us.	Sic erat nobiscum.
he left the room.	cubiculum reliquit.
They're both great indeed.	Sunt et magna quidem.
But that is.	Sed id enim est.
The boy is his.	Puer eius est.
Make it so.	Fac ita esse.
It was a happy time.	Tempus erat felix.
He did not know who it was.	Nesciebat quis esset.
There's nothing better to do.	Nihil melius facere.
I thought tomorrow would be better.	Putabam cras melius fore.
So many things.	Tam multa.
He wants you to come home.	Ipse te domum venire vult.
If we can do it, we can.	Si facere possumus, possumus.
I guess nothing else.	Suspicor nihil aliud.
Or just know me.	Vel solum scire me.
It's a good thing we owe one thing.	Bona res est unum nobis debet.
I'm ready to be friends.	Paratus sum amicos esse.
Like a teacher.	Sicut magister.
But that's only save.	Sed id nisi nisi.
What you need is what you need.	Quod tibi opus est, id tibi opus est.
if you do it right.	si recte feceris.
Yes, but it was.	Etiam sed enim erat.
There could still be more evil.	Non potuit tamen plus esse mali.
And this is enough.	Et hoc satis est.
I didn't know who or whom.	Nesciebam quis vel quo.
I have to stop.	Habeo prohibere.
So it is.	Ita est.
You can't be mine.	Meus esse non potes.
Better if not.	Melius si non.
He can't go on the road.	Iter ire non potest.
I did both.	utrumque ego feci.
No one knows her.	Nemo eam novit.
I am not.	Non sum.
The thing, as it is, is one.	Res, ut est, una est.
But today I can't see you.	Sed hodie te videre non potest.
He has no money.	Pecuniam non habet.
It does not please.	Non placet.
He can't do this.	Hoc facere non potest.
It's time not out.	Aliquam non ex.
that I do.	id facio.
Please tell me.	Dic quaeso.
We don't need time.	Tempus nobis opus non habemus.
These are correct.	Recte haec sunt.
I know him well enough.	Eum satis scio.
But much better.	Sed multo melius.
But always so.	Sed semper sic.
Not sure if at the same time or not.	Non certe si simul vel non.
But so is the question.	Sed sic est quaestio.
Not that much the night before.	Non quod multa nocte ante.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
yes not always.	Etiam non semper est.
That's okay with that.	Quod cum bene.
You're just in time.	Mox in tempore es.
Which is better, who is to say?	Quod melius est, quis est dicere?
It certainly should.	Is certe debet.
I've never met like you before.	Nunquam ante te similis occurrit.
We're not quite there yet.	Non satis ibi adhuc sumus.
There was another thing too.	Aliud quoque fuit.
In which one.	In quis quam.
It looks good.	Non spectat bene.
You tried, really.	Conatus, vere.
It's not bad.	Non est malum.
It was so.	Sic erat.
I know, he knows.	scio, scit.
If you're lucky.	Si felix es.
I don't want to be like him.	Non vis ei similis esse.
There was no need for this.	Hoc opus non erat.
If you don't, do it now.	Si non feceris, fac modo.
It was not very nice.	Non erat admodum.
He didn't want to see her like that.	Noluit videre sibi hoc simile.
Better than that.	Melius quam.
It is enough.	satis est.
Well perhaps we are.	Bene fortasse sumus.
He could not think of why he wanted her.	Non potuit cogitare cur eam vellet.
That still wasn't enough.	Quod adhuc satis non erat.
Which he did well.	Quod bene fecit.
He could not.	Non potuit.
But that's the same thing too.	Sed id ipsum etiam.
It is true.	Verum est.
I can't do much.	Multum facere non possum.
Just like a father.	Sicut pater.
But you are a man.	Sed tu homo es.
I feel better this morning.	Sentio melius hoc mane.
I've seen it before.	Ego ante vidi.
I don't know why or when.	nescio cur vel quando.
It was morning.	Erat mane.
I don't like this.	Non placet hoc.
The thing was, though.	Res fuit, sed.
He did not see me again.	Iterum me non vidit.
If anyone can, you.	Si quis potest, tu.
It's not a little more.	Non plus parum est.
And what do you think?	Quid autem vobis videtur?
It was this time that you needed.	Erat id temporis, quod tibi opus erat.
Or something at all.	Vel aliquid omnino.
These are actually pretty much.	Haec vere satis multa sunt.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Noluit loqui ad me.
I could not believe it.	Credere non potui.
I don't love you anymore.	Non amo amplius.
I just don't want to.	Ut non velit.
and these are for you.	et haec ad te sunt.
It was better.	Melius erat.
But there was nothing to see.	Sed nihil erat videre.
And he did well.	Et bene fecit.
He came before him.	Venit ante se.
I have it with me.	Mecum habeo.
He knew me well.	Mecum non bene sciebat.
Everything in season.	Omnia in tempore.
I don't know how to deal with it.	Nescio quomodo agere.
But you must not stay if you do not wish.	Sed non debes manere si non vis.
There was no one who wanted to speak.	Nemo erat quae loqui vellet.
Well done.	Bene factum est.
Don't do my job for me.	Noli officium meum pro me facere.
I don't know where we are right now.	Nescio ubi nunc sumus.
Well, that's a great question.	Est, magna quaestio est.
Yes, this name is also true.	Ita, hoc quoque nomen eius verum est.
It was so hard to find.	Ita difficile erat invenire.
Maybe he was the only one.	Forte unus, ille fuit.
You can do everything.	Fac potes omnia.
I like it too.	Placet id etiam.
This is my plan.	Hoc est consilium meum.
He could not overcome this.	Hoc vincere non potuit.
Don't say if you don't.	Non dicam si non.
There was no such thing.	Nulla id ipsum erat.
It's time or very important.	Aliquam vel ipsum magna.
We need both.	Utrumque opus habemus.
Maybe this is the first time.	Forsitan hoc primum.
I just need to see it.	Ego iustus ut opus est videre eam.
Everything is there.	Omnia ibi.
I have no better.	Non habeo melius.
And this is too bad.	Et hoc nimis malum est.
It's not like it used to be.	Hoc non est simile esse solebat.
He did not.	Non fecit.
I had nothing else to think about.	aliud cogitare habui.
But I could not do it.	Sed facere non potui.
To-morrow no one says to go.	Cras nemo dicit ire.
what I heard.	quod audivi.
This was by chance.	Hic forte fuit.
we can remain.	manere possumus.
I know how to win.	vincere scio.
But perhaps it does not seem so difficult.	Sed fortasse non ita difficile videtur.
It was good.	Bonum erat.
I do not have.	Non habeo.
It's going to happen.	Eius futurum est.
I'm not at home.	Non sum domi.
If you don't want it, don't.	Si non vis, noli.
It is not true.	Non est verum.
It probably won't.	Quod nec verisimile non.
But no.	Nulla sed.
and still going to school.	et adhuc ad scholam.
That's me.	Id ego.
And if not .	Et si non .
I'm so sorry.	Ita me paenitet.
I couldn't stop my car.	Currus prohibere non potui.
I can't give my name.	Nomen meum dare non possum.
This was before.	Hic ante erat.
He chooses not to.	Velit non.
What was this done?	Quid hoc factum est.
I can not.	Non possum.
No one was any.	Nulla quis aliquam erat.
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum ex.
I know what you see.	Scio quod vide.
Please be happy for me.	Sis felix in me.
You have something else.	Habes aliquid aliud.
He was also from him.	Etiam a ipsum erat.
The same thing is correct.	Recte idem.
I wanted to play again.	Ludere adhuc volui.
It was certain.	Certum erat.
But this morning.	Sed hoc mane.
How would you like some?	Quam vis aliquam!
I'm not really sure.	Non sum vere certus.
You shouldn't talk if you don't want to.	Loqui non debes si non vis.
This is for you.	Hoc est tibi.
never ever again.	Non umquam iterum.
All things are very good.	Omnia valde bona sunt.
That seems too much to me.	Quod mihi nimium videtur.
And I need you.	Et opus est vobis.
No one seems to know the truth.	Nemo verum scire videtur.
Not last week.	Non septimana.
What is?.	Quid est?.
There is no email	Nulla quis.
That's very important.	Ut in ipsum magna.
But probably not.	Sed verisimile non est.
Today, you're just there.	Hodie, tu iustus est.
He barely eats.	Vix comedit.
No one knows why.	Nemo cur.
There is no need for tomorrow.	Cras non opus est.
He has not.	Non habet.
I'll always like it.	Et semper ut eam.
Thus he did.	Sic fecit.
not very nice.	Non admodum admodum.
I don't know what's going to happen.	Nescio quid futurum est.
Can't come to me soon enough.	Satis cito mihi venire non potest.
You too are good to me.	Tu quoque mihi bonus es.
You don't have everything.	Non habes omnia.
I want to do my best.	Volo me optime facere.
It's a pretty long story.	Satis diu res est.
I said this to all.	id omnibus dixi.
But that's only a great idea.	Sed id magna nisi.
It's hard to believe in it.	Difficile est credere in eam.
Just say yes.	Sicut etiam dicere.
And you're totally right.	Et tu prorsus recte.
I don't know how this work is.	Nescio quomodo hoc opus sit.
Take a look! 	Vide!
There was no need.	Nihil opus erat.
We're here to help you.	Hic sumus ut adiuvet te.
So I don't know what to do.	Sic nescio quid faciam.
He was not.	Non erat.
I don't think anyone really.	Non puto aliquem vere.
He came before me.	ante me venit.
Not yet.	Non Nondum.
This has now been done.	Hoc nunc factum est.
I do not yet know.	nondum scio.
But that was the same.	Sed id erat ipsum.
He did very well.	Nimis bene fecit.
We need to help you further.	Non opus est nobis ut te amplius adiuvet.
But it is time.	Sed tempus est.
Not after what just happened.	Non post id quod modo factum est.
It was just too much for him.	Erat solum nimium ei.
That's how bad it is.	Id quam malum est.
what i will do.	quod ego faciam.
You will likely be fine.	Verisimile erit tibi bene.
But there is more.	Sed plus est.
He thought it was too easy.	Nimis facile putavit.
I don't know anything about me.	Nescio quid de me.
There was none at all.	Nulla a nulla erat.
Still what he said.	Adhuc quod dixit.
I need to be alone.	Solus opus esse.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
sorry to say so late.	Paenitet tam sero dicere.
These things are great.	Haec sunt magna.
I thought about you.	Cogitavi de te.
There is one thing that I can't tell you.	Unum est quod non tibi dicere.
Not mine, not always.	Non mea, non semper.
Certainly you don't need both.	Certe non utrumque opus est.
All you want.	Omnes vis.
But that's none of it.	Sed id ipsum nulla.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
But not even this is so bad.	Sed ne hoc quidem ita malum est.
i feel good.	bene sentio.
Happy.	Felix.
Yes, it was true.	Etiam verum erat.
Now that's out loud.	Nunc id magna ex.
It's so good tonight.	Tam bonus est hac nocte.
But neither was he from.	Sed nec ex erat.
He says.	Dicit.
He was not like him.	Non erat ei similis.
he was sure.	certus erat.
You need to do this.	Hoc debes facere.
I didn't want to have anything to do with it.	Nolui habere nihil ad rem.
This time is no different.	Hoc tempus non est aliud.
That was not there.	Quod ibi non erat.
Is it the same for you?	an idem tibi?
I love her.	Eam amo.
I am certain.	Certum habeo.
I've never done this.	Nunquam hoc feci.
Trying to think.	Cogitare conatur.
It has been with me for too long.	Mecum nimis diu fuit.
I feel you.	Sentio tibi.
We are all along.	Inter nos omnia per.
But it is generally bad.	Sed fere mali est.
He does not say, but does.	Non dicit, sed facit.
But no need not.	Sed non opus non est.
For all.	Pro omnibus.
He is going to do it.	Qui id facturus sit.
If you don't do it now.	Si non facere nunc.
I am certain.	Certum habeo.
I'm glad, but hardly surprised.	Gaudeo, sed vix miror.
I wonder where she's gone.	Miror quo illa abiit.
But there was only one.	Sed non erat nisi.
No, he didn't know where it was.	Non, nesciebat ubi sit.
I need a little more of this.	Hoc paulo amplius opus est.
He came.	Is venit.
He says that he could not believe.	Dicit se non posse credere.
Now who was him.	Nunc quis erat ipsum.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
To not save.	Ut non nisi.
I'm trying to help you here.	Im 'conatur hic te adiuvare.
He had to see her.	Videre habuit eam.
But who	Sed quis.
I have not seen why.	Cur non vidi.
I have experienced this for a long time.	Habui hoc diu.
Not much longer.	Non multo iam.
Not yet.	Non tamen.
You have a good name.	Bonum nomen habes.
And almost always.	Et semper fere.
But perhaps not for you.	Sed fortasse non tibi.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
I could not even see.	Ne quidem videre potui.
Life has never been better.	Numquam fuit melius vivere.
But perhaps rightly so.	Sed fortasse recte.
Must be in school.	In schola esse debet.
I don't like doing nothing.	Non placet nihil facere.
Maybe it doesn't work	Aliquam non agit
I'll tell you when.	Dicam tibi quando.
So we're still together.	Sic adhuc una sumus.
This is the only thing I can do.	Hoc solum possum facere.
Can't do it tonight.	Hac nocte facere non potest.
I don't know this.	Hoc nescio.
We're all well here.	Bene hic omnes sumus.
It wasn't what actually happened.	Non erat id quod vere factum est.
You do both.	Utrumque facis.
You can, you know.	Potes, scis.
So you too.	Sic et tu.
he thought.	putavit.
I heard everything he said.	Audivi omnia dixisse.
he wanted to know.	scire voluit.
It seems that is my job.	Videtur quod officium meum est.
I don't like to talk.	Non placet loqui.
I don't do anything.	Non aliquid.
But it is not that.	Sed non est id.
Just like a father.	Sicut pater.
Please help me with this.	Quaeso si me adiuvet hoc.
He eats too quickly.	Nimis cito comedit.
The key is to be honest.	Amet bene sit amet.
I know exactly where it is.	Prorsus scio ubi sit.
and he did it.	et fecit.
I have some fun business.	Habeo aliquam amet rem.
Or it may be.	Vel ut sit.
You do not want.	Non vis.
As it will be.	Sicut erit .
I don't think they can do it.	Non puto posse facere.
I am indebted to you.	Debeo.
Now you can do whatever you want.	Iam potes quod vis.
It does not seem true, it does nothing.	Non videtur verum, nihil facit.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est verum.
I need nothing.	Mihi nihil opus est.
I love my bedroom.	Cubiculum meum amo.
This is who we are.	Hic est qui nobis.
You'll never do that.	Numquam id facere.
As already mentioned	Ut iam dictum est,
It is not that.	Non id est.
I don't know why that is.	Nescio cur id sit.
But I can say this.	Sed hoc possum dicere.
Well, they are not.	Bene, non sunt.
Are you sure we do this?	Certus esne hoc facere nobis?
Well, he didn't.	Bene, non faceret.
And indeed that.	Et quidem id.
This could not have been done.	Quod fieri non potuit.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
Who and where.	Qui ubi.
But we are here.	Sed nos hic sumus.
All I need is now.	Omnia nunc opus est.
It was his first time out.	Primum de suo fuit.
It is necessary to stop.	Necesse est prohibere.
It does not appear to have been.	Non videtur fuisse.
I help you.	Ego tibi.
But not as great as before.	Sed non magna ut ante.
It seems like it was here.	Simile videtur hic fuisse.
This he did.	Hoc fecit.
I don't think it's true.	Non puto verum.
I just want to talk to you.	EGO iustus volo loqui tecum.
I hope you are too.	Spero te quoque.
He does not want to believe.	Non vult credere.
Let no one help you.	Nemo te adiuvet.
She's never met again.	Illa numquam iterum occurrit.
Maybe not before.	Aliquam nec ante.
I'd like to understand.	Libet intelligere.
They are scarce.	Vix sunt.
I don't need this.	Non hoc opus est.
Not soon enough.	Non satis cito.
I'm afraid about that.	Vereor ut.
I don't know what it was.	Nescio quid fuit.
And this is the case.	Et hoc ita se habet.
Not after this.	Non post hoc.
He's not anyone but him.	Hic ne quis nisi se.
And now he's here.	Et nunc hic est.
I was always here.	Hic semper fui.
Don't talk to me!	Noli mecum loqui!
He said to himself.	Dixit se.
All this work has been done.	Hoc totum opus factum est.
I want you to be here with me.	Volo te esse hic mecum.
I haven't seen it.	Non vidi sic.
I know you're there.	Scio te ibi esse.
Maybe that was always the case.	Aliquam id semper erat.
The boy was no longer there.	Puer iam non erat.
did not do this work.	Non fecit hoc opus.
None but said no.	Nulla sed dictum nulla.
To do and to do and to do.	Facere et facere et facere.
I am indebted to you.	Debeo.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
I hardly know you.	Vix te novi.
I thought it was something.	Putavi esse aliquid.
He knew what it was now.	Sciebat quid nunc esset.
All right enough.	Recte satis.
I wish there was still work.	Utinam adhuc opus esset.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
You still travel.	Te tamen iter facit.
I can't take it anymore.	Non possum amplius accipere.
He said that this was his job.	Dixit se hoc suum esse officium.
No one tried to stop me.	Nemo me prohibere conatus est.
But perhaps not.	Sed fortasse non.
It was so busy.	Tam occupatus fuit.
Thus man knows how to conquer.	Sic homo vincere novit.
We can win again.	Iterum vincere possumus.
Not everything.	Non omnia.
To do this, for who to do so.	Facere id, enim qui id.
That's not always the case.	Ut non semper ante.
And quickly concerning him.	Et cito de illo.
But not the time itself.	Sed non tempus ipsum.
Today is not that day.	Hodie non est ille dies.
Maybe that's been said before.	Aliquam id dictum ante.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
And this is true.	Et hoc verum est.
It is possible, however.	Potest tamen.
Without whom he cannot live.	Sine quo vivere non potest.
He could not, indeed.	Non potuit, vere.
He gave everything.	Omnia dedit.
So many things.	Tam multa.
If to the point.	Si ad illud.
She thought it would be good.	Putavit fore bonum esse.
No that's always for us.	Nulla id semper nobis.
Perhaps the best.	Optime fortasse.
I don't know what would happen without you.	Quid futurum esset sine nescio.
But how can he do this good?	Sed quomodo hoc bonum facere potest?
Let it be only.	Sit modo.
All in all.	Omnino.
Not in this way.	Non hoc modo.
How happy it is, it can not yet be seen.	Quam felix sit, nondum videri potest.
He made a book.	Librum fecit.
I don't need it anymore.	Non iam opus est.
First of all it was.	Ante omnia fuit.
No one wants anything.	Nemo aliquid velit.
You can do nothing about it.	Nihil de illo facere potes.
It is difficult to say.	Dicere difficile est.
I don't know what he did.	Quid hoc fecerit nescio.
It's time and none other than that.	Aliquam et nulla quam.
But here we are.	Sed hic sumus.
You are doing very well.	Optime facis.
We need as much as possible.	Nobis quantum opus est.
it was the same for us.	nobis idem fuit.
But do as you need.	Sed fac ut debes.
tell him that I am.	dic ei me esse.
The same is true.	Ita se ipsum.
It is good.	Bene est.
I know it was mine.	Scio meum fuisse.
But it is not so.	Sed ita non est.
For it is.	Est enim.
Nothing to do, nothing to be done.	Nihil facere, nihil fieri.
I have nothing to say to you.	Nihil habeo loqui tibi.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
he does his job.	officium suum facit.
But no one knows this.	Sed hoc nemo scit.
What a journey.	Quod iter.
I didn't like it before.	Ut non velit ante.
This man .	Hic vir .
It's not so bad.	Non ita malum est.
I only have mine.	Tantum habeo meum.
Which is not exactly true.	Quod non est prorsus verum.
There must be someone who doesn't.	Aliquis debet esse qui non.
He could not speak.	Dicere non potuit.
perhaps never will.	numquam fortasse erit.
It is true who you are.	Verum est qui sis.
I could not play.	Ludere non potui.
I just like the money.	Modo ut pecuniam.
I have something to do.	Habeo aliquid facere.
He did not know what he was doing with them all.	Nesciebat quid cum omnibus faceret.
You can't do everything.	Omnia non potes.
I don't have time.	Non tempus.
I know more than you.	Plus scio quam tu.
He didn't want to stop.	Nolebat prohibere.
And so you are.	Et sic es.
It is indeed.	Est quidem.
Well here.	Hic bene.
Your not trying too hard.	Non difficile conatur tuum.
Not all is well.	Non omnia bene.
Not long yet.	Non diu tamen.
I can't do everything today or this week.	Non possum omnia hodie vel hac septimana facere.
Do as he was.	Fac ut erat.
He was my teacher in school.	Magister in schola mea erat.
Where you are now, we are all.	Ubi nunc es, omnes sumus.
i know it does.	scio facit.
Which perhaps he can't do with me.	Quod fortasse mecum facere non potest.
To be honest it was great.	Ut sit amet magna erat.
I haven't even heard it.	Ne illud quidem audivi.
But however.	Sed tamen.
And he has everything.	Et habet ad omnia.
I wanted to be done.	fieri volui.
You can do everything.	Omnia potes.
Here's my advice to yourself.	Hic meum consilium ipsum.
I know you don't exist.	Scio te non esse.
I'm going home.	Nunc domum.
You need to know.	Scire debes.
Or something like that.	Vel aliquid ut.
A quid but.	A quid nisi.
It was not his business.	Non eius res fuit.
In that regard.	In id ipsum quam.
Yes that's great and great.	Etiam id magna magna.
Quite loud.	Satis magna.
Yes this is evil, exactly.	Ita hoc malum est, prorsus.
By that time it's too late.	Per tempus illud tempus est nimis sero.
Is big.	Magna est.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
Maybe a little.	Fortasse paulo.
That is .	Id est .
That's it now.	Id nunc.
It has to be better.	Non habet esse melius.
But what a thing to do.	Sed rem facere quo.
This is not true.	Hic non.
I was not here.	Hic non fui.
No not great.	Nulla non magna.
But this is not possible.	Sed id fieri non potest.
But who is none other than that.	Sed quis nulla quam.
I wanted to know you.	Scire te volui.
That's not right now.	Quod nec nunc.
I like the decision to be made or not.	Placet consilium fieri vel non.
I haven't done it yet.	Non feci tamen.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
But see what it is.	Sed vide quid sit.
Really not much.	Vere non multum.
He said to him.	Dixit ei ille.
i would like too much.	nimium vellem.
But not much to do.	Sed id facere non multum.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
This was what he wanted.	Hoc erat quod voluit.
I want as much as I can.	Multum volo quod esse non potest.
This is not what you want to do.	Hoc non vis facere.
I'm in school.	In schola sum.
Tell me.	Dic mihi.
Soon, it would be.	Mox, esset.
Felix was behind her.	Felix fuit post eam.
This was always my thing.	Haec semper mea res erat.
But, boy, did you.	Sed, puer, fecit te.
That was what it was.	Id erat id erat.
But this is not correct.	Sed hoc non recte.
Absolutely everything you think.	Omnino cogitas omnia.
I'm not ready.	Non sum paratus.
Yes, do it right.	Sic, recte facias.
But it is time.	Sed tempus est.
The job has been done.	Factum est officium.
I do not know what.	nescio quid.
I need to see it.	Mihi opus est videre eam.
We don't like it.	Nobis non placet.
I'm hard to do something.	Im Difficile est aliquid.
There again.	Ibi iterum.
I am quite happy going home.	Ego satis gaudeo domum.
Not the same dog ever since.	Non idem canis ex quo.
I've never met him.	Nunquam occurrit ei.
Until morning.	Usque mane.
But this is it.	Sed hoc est.
So my father did.	Ita pater meus fecit.
Go into the room with him.	Ire in cubiculum cum eo.
What is it? 	Quid est hoc?
Is he happy?	estne felix?
This was done today.	Hoc hodie factum est.
I like talking about you.	Placet de te.
don't like me.	Non placet in me.
You may not want to have it.	Nolo eam habere potes.
This was not enough.	Hoc parum fuit.
I will tell the truth.	Verum dicam.
I told him so much yesterday.	Heri tantum ei dixi.
It's not.	Suus 'non.
It's still time to leave you.	Est adhuc tempus relinquere te.
I am already	Jam ego.
I think it's possible too.	Puto etiam posse.
I wanted to go.	ire volui.
he had nothing.	nihil habuit.
I believe it would be.	fore credo.
I don't even have a name.	Ne nomen quidem habeo.
That is, it could be.	Id est, posset.
I just don't know what else to say.	Modo nescio quid aliud dicere.
This was not done before.	Id ante non.
You can probably do better.	Probabiliter potes melius facere.
I didn't know where it was.	Nesciebam ubi esset.
He has always been good to me.	Mihi semper bonus fuit.
And rightly indeed.	Et recte quidem.
Police have not said.	Aliquam non dictum est.
This boy was when he was.	Hic puer erat, cum esset.
but I like to travel.	ut essem iter, sed.
I don't like it here, you know.	Non placet hic, tu scis.
I don't know much about him.	Nescio nimis de eo.
It is not so.	Non est ita.
Nothing could hinder him.	Nihil prohibere potuit.
He is also very happy with himself.	Etiam sit amet quam ipsum.
I can't tell you at all.	Non possum omnino tibi dicere.
left for work.	opus reliquit.
You've definitely done a lot of time in this.	Multum temporis in hoc certo fecisti.
Make yourself see.	Fac te ipsum videre.
But I.	Sed ego.
So it is.	Ita est.
But to myself.	Sed ad me ipsum.
Please, tell me.	Quaeso, dic.
I couldn't even find you the first time.	Ne primum quidem te invenire potui.
The next night the same.	Proxima nocte idem.
I want this to be true.	Hoc volo non esse verum.
I am surprised that he knows my name.	Miror quod nomen meum novit.
It is not a race.	Genus non.
I really love you.	Ego vere amo.
Do you want to see this?	Visne hoc videre?
I wanted to do it.	facere volui.
This was my job.	Hoc erat officium meum.
That was not good.	Quod non erat bonum.
Just do it.	Solum fac id.
Maybe even better.	Forte melius vel.
But if everything goes well.	Sed si bene omnia.
There was nothing to see.	Nihil erat videre.
i thought we were having a good morning.	Putabam nos habere bonum mane.
You can say nothing.	Nihil potes dicere.
We are not yet there.	Nondum ibi sumus.
Now it's almost none.	Nunc fere nulla est.
There was someone behind him.	Post eum fuit aliquis.
he says.	dicit.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
I know you understand.	Scio te intelligere.
He was still scared.	Vix adhuc erat.
She did it.	Illa fecit.
It is not difficult.	Non est difficile.
it is necessary to go.	ire necesse est.
Nothing from that time	Nihil ex eo tempore.
I knew it was going to be true at last.	Sciebam verum futurum esse tandem.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
Or it could be.	Vel posset.
You can't speak.	Non potes loqui.
Not in this way.	Non hoc modo.
He does this very well.	Optime hoc facit.
I wanted to be someone.	esse aliquem volui.
It was not for you.	Non erat tibi.
It was already late.	Iam sero erat.
He gave everything.	Omnia dedit.
It's probably not the same for you.	Verisimile non est idem tibi.
I've been through a lot of time.	Fui per multum simul.
As of today.	Ut hodie.
You just want.	Tu modo velis.
Maybe he didn't.	Fortasse non fecit.
You think the future is better than today.	Putas futurum melius quam hodie.
Not so in his own time.	Non ita suo tempore.
But the thing is there.	Sed res ibi.
I have it.	ego id habeo.
She asked in the morning.	Mane quaesivit illa.
He did as much as possible.	Fieri fecit ut.
What he himself wanted.	Quod ipse voluit.
Time is the plan.	Tempus est consilium.
That's what it was before.	Ut id erat ante.
i never knew.	numquam scivi.
yes you say something.	Etiam tu aliquid dicere.
That is gone.	Quod abiit.
I just wasn't.	Modo non fuit.
He did not understand, he did not understand.	Non intellexit, non intellexit.
I have nothing to say.	Nihil habeo quod dicam.
Not much.	Non multum.
She refused to do anything.	Nihil facere illa noluit.
I'm not sure if it's wrong with me or not.	Non sum certus si mali est de me vel non.
There was none.	Nulla erat.
I think it's you.	Puto esse te.
That's what you did.	Id quod fecisti.
And he is not going.	Et non eat.
Not that.	Non illud.
I heard nothing from him.	Nihil ab eo audivi.
What I didn't know.	Quid ego nesciebam.
It could not be, but it could not be.	Fieri non potuit, verum esse non potuit.
And you are	Et tu es .
I tried to talk to her.	Conatus sum loqui ad eam.
This is not working.	Hoc non opus est.
But you do not want this, as you said.	Sed hoc, ut dixisti, non vis.
I don't know how you did it.	Nescio quomodo feceris.
It's not always that.	Etiam non semper quam.
I do not doubt.	Non dubito.
I said too much about myself.	De me nimium dixi.
I think there is.	Puto ibi esse.
It has been said and done about.	Dictum et fere.
and if you are, I beg you.	quod si es, quaeso te.
I will say probably yes.	Probabiliter etiam dicam.
But it is so.	Sed ita est.
I will do this.	Hoc faciam.
No one knew the matter.	Nemo rem scivit.
Nothing is enough.	Nihil satis est.
It was already enough time.	Iam satis temporis erat.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
Someone had to talk.	Habuit aliquis dicere.
What is.	Quid est.
Time knows well.	Tempus bene scit.
I know him without whom there is nothing to do.	Scio eum, sine quo nihil est facturus.
And again.	Et iterum.
The thing is exactly like how you've said it.	Res prorsus similis est quomodo tu dictum est.
No one can help you.	Nemo te adiuvare potest.
It is probably still alive.	Probabiliter adhuc est.
It will be in the fridge.	In amet erit.
So does this boy.	Sic facit hic puer.
Maybe that was all.	Fortasse id totum fuit.
It is true, you know.	Verum est, scis.
I just know that he is not.	Modo scio eum non esse.
What do you want?.	Quid vis?.
But he does this.	Hoc tamen facit.
You've got to think about it.	Illa te cogitare de obtinuit.
he did not say this to him at first.	non hoc ei primum dixit.
They are evil.	Mali sunt.
What is "to have"?	Quid est 'habere'?
They are not present.	Non sunt nunc.
One thing is always true.	Unum semper verum dicere.
There is no way to do it yourself.	Nulla ut enim ipsum.
And this seems to be one way to do it.	Et hoc videtur unum modo facere.
I thought it was really good.	Putavi vere bonum esse.
It's too big.	Nimis magna est.
This may be true.	Hoc verum sit.
I never forgot her.	Numquam oblitus est eius.
It doesn't appear anymore.	Quod non videtur amplius.
yes it is not bad.	Etiam non est malum.
I could not think of what he meant.	Non potui cogitare quid vellet.
But they are not yet.	Sed non sunt adhuc.
But soon enough.	Sed mox satis.
You are totally right.	Prorsus recte es.
No one was saying this.	Nemo erat id dicere.
I often wonder what will happen.	Saepe miror quid futurum sit.
I don't know them all.	Nescio omnes.
this does not occur to me.	id mihi non occurrit.
Who says this?	Quis hoc dicit?
We just didn't know anything else.	Nos iustus aliud nesciebam.
You are mine, always mine.	Meus es, semper meus.
You are not yet ready.	Nondum paratus es.
And why not.	Cur autem non.
This does not mean that.	Hoc non vult esse.
i love you and everything.	amo te et omnia.
This is pretty good.	Hoc est satis bonum.
I can't really think of it.	Rem non possum cogitare.
And not even rightly so.	Et ne recte quidem.
can remain.	manere potest.
Both at the same time.	Ambo simul.
It was done, however.	Factum est tamen.
Which is the case.	Quod ita se habet.
we are never.	numquam sumus.
It will be much better.	Multo melius erit.
He comes to us for help.	Venit ad nos auxilium.
It's time to get there.	Aliquam ut est est.
She thought well of me.	Bene mecum, sibi putavit.
He can barely see.	Vix videre possit.
And at this time	Et in hoc tempore.
I looked again in time.	Iterum vidi in tempore.
That's the only way.	Id solum.
I can't tell people what to do.	Non possum dicere homines facere quae sunt.
And rightly so too.	Et recte etiam.
I have not forgotten.	non oblitus fui.
I'm glad you're well.	Gaudeo te bene esse.
He knows what really happened.	Scit quid vere factum sit.
Don't talk too much.	Noli nimium loqui.
It's work, it's a job.	Est opus, est officium.
neither do you.	nec tu.
I do not see.	Non video.
He wanted something else.	Aliud esse voluit.
than never.	quam numquam.
Someone to give everything.	Aliquis omnia dare.
That is for sure.	Id est pro certo.
He would not, however.	Noluit tamen.
Today everybody does everything.	Hodie omnes facit omnia.
It's going to happen.	Futurum est.
I told you it was not going to happen.	Dixi tibi sic non futurum esse.
It would be great if	Si magna esset.
No no no great.	Nulla nec magna.
I want to know everything.	Scire volo omnia.
I'm sorry, boy.	Me paenitet, puer.
That she did.	Id fecit.
This is way better than that.	Hoc modo melius est esse.
Never and never.	Numquam et numquam.
I feel what I feel.	Sentio quod sentio.
There's something she wants to see.	Ibi est quod te videre non vult.
So it wasn't even a problem.	Ita ne quaestio quidem fuit.
I will too.	Volo etiam.
No one thought either.	Nemo vel cogitavi.
for truly.	vere enim.
It is good.	Bene est.
I don't know what he means.	Quid sibi velit nescio.
He was a good man.	Erat vir bonus.
You don't have to make money.	Pecuniam facere non habes.
And they are still there for a year.	Et adhuc sunt ibi in anno.
No one did it.	Nemo id fecit.
But it is not possible.	Sed fieri non potest.
I did, and it's not enough.	Feci, et non satis est.
First you have to find.	Primum habes invenire.
He spoke thus.	Sic dixit.
Nothing more.	Nihil amplius.
but never do it.	numquam id sed.
i have to say.	habeo dicere.
Maybe no more than that.	Aliquam nec ipsum quam.
Please try again or later on.	Aliquam vel dictum ex.
This is also true.	Hoc etiam verum est.
He treats of her.	Agit de suo.
he did not know why.	nesciebat quare.
He wants nothing.	Nihil sibi vult.
I feel so lucky.	Ita sentio felix.
I hope you could.	Spero posse.
But that is none.	Sed id nulla est.
And this to me a lot.	Et hoc mihi multum.
But here I can't say much about him.	Hic tamen multa de eo dicere non possum.
That seems difficult.	Quod difficile videtur.
To be honest.	Ut sit amet.
He is gone.	Abiit.
He wants to be here.	Hic esse velit.
His, yours.	Suum, tuum.
That's very important to us.	Magna id ipsum nobis.
You should have an affair.	Rem habere debes.
That should stop by.	Quod per prohibere debet.
Which is seen.	Quod videtur.
That it is so, can be seen thus.	Quod ita sit, sic videri potest.
I know this.	Id scio.
No time for everything, that's great.	Nulla tempus omnia, id magna.
You need to know everything.	Scire debes omnia.
He knew that he was going to do something.	Sciebat se aliquid facturum esse.
In a statement.	In a dictum est.
I could not do more.	non potui amplius.
I can't talk anymore.	Non possum amplius dicere.
He is good.	Eum bonum, est.
Exactly like each other.	Prorsus sicut inter se.
We don't need someone to believe.	Non opus est nobis aliquem credere.
For we have	Habemus enim .
I don't like the guy.	Non amo guy.
I haven't even been home yet.	Ego ne domi quidem adhuc fui.
I tried to make it home so I need it.	Conatus sum facere domum, ut tibi opus sit.
It has been a long time.	Non diu fuit.
Make a book.	Librum fac.
He said to me.	Dixit ad me .
But that's too easy.	Sed id nimis facile.
That's not the first time.	Ut non est ante.
At that time now.	In id tempus nunc.
It was his time.	Eius erat tempus.
He cannot have both.	Utrumque habere non potest.
he was through.	erat per.
i can have.	habere possum.
This may take some time.	Id ut aliquam.
It could be your own, it could be yours.	Posset esse suum, posset esse tuum.
It will be more than you know!	Plus erit quam scis!.
That something can be done.	Quod aliquid fieri possit.
But there are also.	Sed et sunt.
How can it be done.	Quomodo fieri potest.
The time has come.	Venit in tempore.
it is certain to me.	certum mihi est.
I don't really want anything.	Non vere volo aliquid.
He could not be certain.	Certum esse non potuit.
Now look at him.	Nunc vide ipsum.
You're too young.	Nimis puer es.
I never wanted to do this before.	Numquam ante hoc facere voluit.
If he wants.	Si velit.
It has been a long time.	Iam diu fuit.
Well who could.	Bene quis posset.
But the situation is so.	Sed ita se habet.
At least now.	Modo certe.
i have done it yet.	adhuc feci.
I absolutely love you.	Prorsus amo.
Enough about me.	De me satis.
I can't leave it again.	Non possum iterum eam relinquere.
Now is the time to get yourself out.	Nunc tempus ipsum ut ex.
Why do I do the thing.	Cur ego rem.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
Good guy.	Bene est guy.
This is not even seen.	Hoc ne quidem videtur.
And still there.	Et adhuc ibi.
It's time to save time.	Aliquam ut tempus nisi.
Now let's start now.	Nunc sit amet nunc.
Or perhaps.	Vel fortasse.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
That was the first time.	Primum erat id.
No, there is none.	Nulla, nulla est.
It seemed.	Videbatur.
No, neither was there any, nor ever before.	Nulla nec aliquam erat, vel semper ante.
It is never too late.	Numquam sero.
It is a great thing.	Magna res est.
Maybe that was him.	Aliquam ut erat ipsum.
I know indeed.	Scio quidem.
but he himself.	sed ipse.
Help? 	Auxilium?
I certainly don't like it.	Ego certe non placet.
This just doesn't do it for me.	Hoc modo non id mihi.
he did his job.	officium suum fecit.
Now now.	Nunc nunc.
He did the same.	Idem fecit.
So what's wrong?	Ita, quid mali est?
He does too much, man.	Nimium facit, homo.
After this question comes to you.	Post haec quaestio ad te venit.
I doubt greatly.	valde dubito.
All the same.	Omnibus idem.
I like it more.	Placet, amplius.
You know what's going to happen.	Scis quid futurum sit.
I need to know.	Scire opus est.
He was only here.	Hic modo erat.
It was late now.	Sero nunc erat.
He did not know what it was.	Nesciebat quid esset.
Certainly it is so.	Certe ita est.
He can't speak.	Dicere non potest.
He truly loves me.	Vere amat.
But to him there was none.	Sed ei nulla erat.
But not the time itself.	Sed non tempus ipsum.
This was really good.	Hoc erat vere bonum.
you have enough time.	satis temporis habes.
It was not so much.	Tantum non erat.
Thanks a lot!	Multum agere;
Maybe years ago.	Fortasse annos.
I couldn't think of anything to say.	Non potuit cogitare quid dicam.
He refused to speak to me.	Noluit mihi dicere.
No one seems to be able to help him.	Nemo eum adiuvare posse videtur.
Something else too.	Aliud quoque.
It was better.	Melius erat.
I love him, but I don't know what to do.	Eum amo, sed quid faciam nescio.
Now it won't be.	Nunc non erit.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
He also does not.	Ipse quoque non.
Maybe not only.	Aliquam non nisi.
We don't need it.	Non opus est nobis.
This time it was different.	Aliud erat hoc tempore.
Today is not true.	Hodie verum non est.
and asked.	et rogavit.
It seems to me that we know we are here.	Mihi videtur scire nos hic esse.
But you should not believe this.	Sed hoc non debes credere.
I must be here.	Mihi necesse est hic esse.
He does not come any more.	Non venit amplius.
He has for you.	Habet enim te.
You don't have.	Non habes.
But it is not so easy.	Sed non tam facile.
She doesn't want to be good enough.	Quae non satis vult esse.
Tell her something.	Dic ei quid.
I wish that were my advice.	Utinam esset consilium meum.
But certainly nothing else.	Sed certe nihil aliud.
For that is.	Id enim est.
Only between you and me.	Modo inter me et te.
So it is.	Ita est.
Don't think, just do it!	Noli cogitare, modo fac!.
Nothing else to say.	Nihil aliud dicere.
Happy to talk to someone.	Felix de aliquo loqui.
He knew he was not indebted.	Sciebat se non debere.
When to work?	Quando ad opus?
The boy doesn't want to be.	Puer non vult esse.
I could not see where you did it.	non potui videre ubi id feceris.
We both.	Nos ambo.
he said to himself.	dixit se.
No one knows what you mean except yourself.	Nemo scit quid vis, nisi tibi.
It was also true.	Verum etiam fuit.
But it will be better in the end.	Sed melius tandem erit.
I absolutely believe you.	Omnino tibi credo.
It is working well now.	Nunc bene sit opus.
How could it be done? 	Quomodo fieri potuit?
he asked himself.	quaesivit ipse.
I believe.	credo.
It's not the same.	Etiam non ipsum est.
Well, I don't know exactly this type.	Bene, nescio an prorsus hoc genus.
Please do not go early.	Noli ire, quaeso, mane.
That never, never.	Id numquam, numquam.
There was a need to know.	Scire opus erat.
Who was.	Quis erat.
There is a lot of work to be done.	Multum est opus faciendum.
That is not the case now.	Quod iam non est.
Your advice is here.	Tuum consilium hic est.
Nothing is.	Nihil est.
But there is still much to be done.	Sed multum tamen faciendum est.
You need to know the time to do it.	Scire debes tempus ad faciendum illud.
But you don't want to do this.	Sed hoc facere non vis.
I was lucky as you can be.	Felix fui quantum potes esse.
You can see and hear all things truly here.	Hic etiam omnia vere videre et audire potes.
But to do what has been said.	Sed facere quod dictum est.
I just wasn't sure what she meant.	Modo quid hoc vellet, non erat certus.
This is what we all have.	Hoc est quod nos omnes habemus.
But something has been done.	Sed aliquid factum est.
Nothing seems to be possible about this.	Hoc nihil fieri posse videtur.
I hope all is well with you.	Spero bene tibi.
He says why.	Dicit quare.
I could not stop myself.	Non potui me prohibere.
But not at all.	Sed non nulla.
There is no time to love him any time.	Nulla et nunc ut ipsum quis nunc.
Even if he wants to do so.	Etiam id nisi velit.
Certainly you do.	Certe facis.
And all indeed.	Et omnes quidem.
That's how you want, so you got it.	Sic quomodo vis, sic obtinuit.
But not so bad.	Sed non ita malum.
I just want to be myself.	Ego iustus volo me esse.
It's kind of like this.	Genus hoc modo est.
But you don't want this.	Sed hoc non vis.
No one has ever seen.	Nemo vidit umquam.
Too much time to think here.	Nimis tempus est hic cogitare.
It's not there.	Est non est.
he knew very well.	parum bene sciebat.
Thus you said.	Sic dixisti.
This is definitely not looking good.	Hoc est certus non vultus bonus.
Your goods are up now.	Tua bona sunt usque nunc.
There is no way to save.	Nulla ut nisi.
This is the dog.	Canis hic est.
He said that he was well.	Dixit se bene esse.
Three faces.	Tres vultus eius.
Well there it is.	Bene ibi est.
Let it be.	Sit.
But something for me to do.	Sed aliquid in me facere.
We both like it here.	Ambo placet hic.
Well done job.	Bene factum est officium.
He gave me.	DEDIT MIHI.
Never let him down either.	Numquam vel illum.
Everyone thinks you are alone.	Solus cogitat omnes te esse.
Boy, it's too late.	Puer, sero est.
Yes, good question.	Ita, bona quaestio.
No one seems to do this.	Hoc facere nemo videtur.
But not me at all.	Sed nec me omnia.
Which still is, I am not quite sure.	Quod adhuc est, non satis certum habeo.
You can do nothing about it.	Nihil de eo facere potes.
OF NIGHT	DE NOCTE.
But let me do something.	Sed fac mihi aliquid.
What a? 	Quod a?
I know what his job is.	Scio quid eius sit officium.
I just wasn't sure.	Ego iustus certus non erat.
He says nothing to me.	Nihil dicit mihi.
I don't know why that's happened.	Nescio cur id acciderit.
One thing else.	Unum aliud.
I am sure like me.	Certus sum, sicut me.
I'll tell you tomorrow.	Dicam tibi cras.
It's not bad.	Non est malum.
She asked me, and it's enough for me.	Rogavit me, et mihi satis est.
Where ever you are.	Ubi semper es.
And it is still true.	Et adhuc verum est.
Lunch is only late.	Nisi sero prandium est.
Now we have no plan.	Nunc consilium non habemus.
and what journey it was.	et quod iter esset.
That's a great idea.	Ut in dictum magna.
It will never be enough.	Numquam satis erit.
Get out of this yourself.	Ut ex hac ipsum.
So you too.	Sic et tu.
It's his name.	Est nomen eius.
I don't need to do anything.	Non opus est facere aliquid.
They are not like us.	Non sunt sicut nos.
No one can.	Nemo potest.
I love money now.	Pecuniam nunc amo.
That's what he does.	Id quod agit.
But it is not so.	Sed non ita est.
we cannot know.	scire non possumus.
No one comes.	Nemo venit.
No id right now.	Nulla id nunc.
I'm sorry I'm not sorry.	Paenitet me paenitet, non.
There is no certainty of this.	De hoc quid sit certum non est.
Or he could have.	Vel habere potuit .
Which again appears.	Quod iterum videtur.
When he wanted to.	Cum vellet.
I think you're going to do it.	id te facturum puto.
This is how it is.	Haec quomodo sit.
Well, I don't like it.	Bene, non placet.
Again that's me.	Iterum id me.
It was even before.	Etiam vel ante erat.
It is probably a good decision.	Probabile est bonum consilium.
I said.	dixi.
Not so much.	Tantum non.
He does what he wants.	Facit quod vult.
But you are right.	Sed tu recte.
that perhaps was the reason why nothing was done.	id fortasse fuit quare nihil factum est.
I said it would be in the afternoon.	Dixi eum fore post meridiem.
This has never been done before.	Hoc numquam ante factum est.
In this way it makes me so.	Hoc modo me sic facit .
I'll tell you one more time.	Dicam tibi unum tempus.
To say that.	Dicere.
He has some interest.	Habet aliquam rem.
Do it correctly.	Fac recte.
But he was able to do so.	Sed hoc facere potuit.
Make friends.	Fac amicos habere.
But neither is it.	Sed nec est.
There really isn't anything for me to do.	Ibi vere non est mihi aliquid facere.
which I wanted to be better.	quod melius esse volui.
You probably too.	Probabiliter tu quoque.
He wants to live again.	Iterum vivere vult.
Everything is better in the morning.	Omnia melius mane.
Tell her again.	Dic ei iterum.
The man who is not the father is not a man.	Homo, qui pater non est, homo non est.
I was behind him.	post eum fui.
I told him many things.	Multa dixi ei.
There is absolutely nothing wrong.	Omnino nihil mali est.
I never believe it.	Numquam id credo.
This was actually done.	Hoc vere factum est.
You must believe this.	Hoc debes credere.
I would like to have a little longer.	Vellem paulo diutius habere.
He can give himself time.	Potest se tempus dare.
Maybe he really did.	Fortasse vere fecit.
In a great voice.	In dictum magna magna.
He wanted to know more.	Plus scire voluit.
But not so.	Sed non sic.
That should be that.	Id esse debet id.
It's not looking good.	Suus non vultus bonus.
I don't want him to know this.	Nolo eum hoc scire.
I knew it was wrong.	Malum esse sciebam.
Now take some of it.	Nunc id aliquam ex.
He never knew.	Nunquam scivit.
It's actually pretty good.	Est vere satis bona.
There was no time to talk about this.	Nec tempus erat hoc loqui.
in or before him.	In vel ante ipsum.
Not easy, though.	Non facile, sed.
I don't like it.	Non placet ei.
Great indeed.	Magna quidem.
No one understood.	Nemo intellexit.
And you can have it.	Et habere potes.
I had no interest in doing this.	Nihil rem facere id.
My father likes me.	Pater meus me vult.
All is well.	Omnia bene.
He could do nothing.	Nihil potuit.
But he knew that he was going to do something.	Sed sciebat se aliquid facturum.
It was not that.	Non erat id.
This is what you don't like.	Hoc est quod tibi non placet.
Is that what you want? 	Estne id quod vis?
I feel good too.	Bene etiam sentio.
No one could do it for me.	Nemo me facere potuit.
It's up to him.	Est ad ipsum.
he says.	dicit.
I wanted to have her.	Hanc volui habere.
but he did not do it for us.	pro nobis tamen non fecit.
Not to you if you don't like it.	Non tibi, si tibi non placet.
Yes, you can do nothing.	Etiam nihil potes.
He refused to give his name.	Nomen suum dare noluit.
Everything is in your hands.	Omnia in tua.
He had nothing to say about him.	De eo nihil habuit dicere.
It's after one.	Est post unum.
He seemed to speak to her.	Sibi videbatur loqui.
How does this work?	Quomodo hoc opus facit?
There is no time for it.	Nulla id tempus ipsum.
It's time to get it out.	Aliquam ut erat ex.
Is good.	Bonus est.
I've been thinking about this for a long time.	de hoc diu cogitavi.
He was always giving.	Semper erat dare.
But I don't have time out.	Sed non tempus ex.
Certainly so.	Certe ita.
This is no longer true.	Hoc iam verum non est.
Not quite right.	Non satis recte.
Unless today.	Nisi hodie.
not in the game.	In non ipsum.
But there you are.	Sed ibi es.
That is important to us.	Id sit amet nobis.
You've done the work.	Tu fecisti opus.
In this we are one.	In hoc una sumus.
Up to this point.	Huc usque.
I think this is correct.	Hoc recte puto.
Don't talk to me.	Noli mihi loqui.
He never wants.	Numquam velit.
But this is not so.	Sed hoc non ita est.
But no more than that.	Sed vel nulla quam.
If he does, well.	Si facit, bene.
That it is possible.	Quod potest.
But that was not enough.	Sed id parum erat.
He never told me about this.	Numquam mihi de hoc dixit.
Nothing is better than something.	Nihil certe melius est aliquid.
Be there every morning.	Ibi omnes mane.
Without my dad I can't do this.	Sine pater meus hoc facere non possum.
But this for the time being.	Sed hoc ad tempus.
And you know why.	Et scis quare.
For something or anyone.	Aliquid enim vel quis.
We have not yet enough.	Nondum satis habemus.
You need it.	Opus tibi est.
we have to be.	esse habemus.
Not before, but after him.	Non ante, sed post eum.
Now if that's what you want, okay.	Nunc, si id quod vis, bene.
He gave you.	Dedit te.
She has three days to live.	Habet tres dies vivere.
Can we travel in time?	Per tempus iter possumus?
She said too much.	Illa nimium dixit.
One has to live.	Vivere unum habet.
He did not eat.	Non comedit.
I can't give out this.	Non possum de hoc dare.
It was just like, well, this is what I need.	Sicut erat, bene, hoc mihi opus est.
I don't like it.	Non ut illud.
For he says.	Dicit enim.
It's time to do something.	Aliquam id aliquam est.
This is difficult.	Hoc difficile est.
it was a plan.	consilium fuit.
At this time he said.	Hoc tempore dixit.
Not very likely.	Non multum probabile.
I know he is getting better.	Novi ille melius questus est.
There is someone you can do but like.	Est aliquis potes, sed simile.
Here they are.	Hic sunt.
It is enough.	Satis est.
Maybe that was some.	Aliquam id aliquam erat.
The dog is day by night.	Canis dies nocte.
No, you should not.	Non, non debes.
Not in a week.	Non in septimana.
I don't like just one tonight.	Sicut una hac nocte non placet.
Exactly what you said.	Prorsus quod dixisti.
He said it was done.	Factum dixit.
Nothing new here again.	Nihil novi hic iterum.
But this will not be.	Sed hoc non erit.
Nothing is gonna be said before.	Nulla sit amet dictum ante.
But we cannot be done.	Sed fieri non possumus.
It does not please.	Non placet.
Tomorrow some.	Cras aliquam.
I think you got it.	Puto obtinuit.
He was the father.	Pater erat.
Because you are.	Pro eo es tu.
To see this you have to believe.	Videre habes hoc credere.
He does the same.	Idem facit.
I need to go and you.	Mihi necesse est ire, et tu.
Maybe she doesn't like it much.	Fortasse non multum sibi placet.
Not much, but little.	Non multum, sed parum.
But that's enough.	Sed id satis.
To be or not to be, that is the question.	Esse vel non esse, id est quaestio.
Not so much for me.	Non tam mihi.
As stated in the report.	Ut in dictum ipsum.
It's a car.	Currus suus est.
This he does.	Hoc facit.
There is no job.	Non est officium.
Never and never will.	Numquam et numquam et.
My husband	Vir meus .
Nothing pleases me.	Nihil placet loqui.
I am none and all.	nemo sum et omnes.
At last I saw my father.	Tandem pater meus vidi.
I see you.	Te video.
Not too early now.	Non nunc etiam mane.
He wanted a house.	Domum voluit.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
Never do it.	Nunquam id facias.
My room is now.	Cubiculum meum nunc est.
At last.	Tandem.
But only if you want to be true.	Sed solum verum est si vis esse.
I do not yet.	Non tamen facio.
I have this.	hoc habeo.
And we.	Et nos.
Please stay home unless absolutely necessary.	Quaeso manere domum nisi omnino necesse est.
You are still here.	Hic tamen es.
You can say nothing.	Nihil potes dicere.
And it was great.	Et erat magna.
The time was true.	Tempus verum erat.
Not that either.	Non quod vel.
That's not the only one.	Id est non unum solum.
And yet it was different.	Et, sed adhuc aliud fuit.
That's how it is.	Id quantum est.
To say so.	Ut ita dicam.
You have a job to do.	Habes officium facere.
It made him want more.	Plus ei vis fecit.
But he could not stop.	Sed prohibere non potuit.
Totally gone.	Prorsus abiit.
You may even have a job.	Vos vel officium habere potest.
to do what i want.	facere quod volo.
What he wants.	Quae velit.
You are not a man.	Non homo.
It's not in me that I can't tell you.	Non est in me, ut non dicam tibi.
And we're not there.	Et non sumus ibi.
It does not please.	Non placet.
I'm glad that it's you and not me.	Gaudeo quod tibi est et non me.
Do this just beforehand.	Hoc solum ante facere.
Now it is hard to think.	Nunc difficile est putare.
Trying to think of something else.	Cogitare aliquid aliud conatus est.
It's time or nothing.	Aliquam vel nulla est.
And perhaps it is.	Et fortasse est.
Maybe it was nothing.	Aliquam non erat nisi.
You are not right.	Non recte.
I have it for sure.	Pro certo habeo illud.
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
Something to do with it. 	Facere aliquid cum eo. 
He is gone from you.	Abiit a te.
This will be my job.	Hoc erit officium meum.
She's been busy.	Illa occupatus fuit.
I just want to do what is right.	EGO iustus volo fac id quod est.
I really like to see that.	Ego vere amo video esse.
I hope you're doing well.	Spero te bene.
This may be the first class.	Hoc primum potest esse genus.
It will be better for us.	Melius nobis erit.
I was one.	unum essem.
What do you do?.	Quid facis?.
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
But neither was he now.	Sed nec nunc erat.
But not even now.	Sed ne id quidem nunc.
She was not scared.	Vix illa non erat.
You are ready.	Paratus es.
I knew this to be true.	hoc verum esse sciebam.
Which is true.	Quod verum est.
Never do that yourself.	Numquam id ipsum.
What's the difference?	Quid sit amet?.
He didn't want to think about it.	Noluit cogitare de illo.
This was just in and on.	Hoc modo erat in et in.
You can't do it for me.	Non potes me facere.
It is time that this issue has been resolved.	Tempus est quod haec res est certus.
Something like that.	Aliquid simile quod.
It will be probably late again.	Probabiliter sero iterum erit.
Really like him.	Vere similis ei.
Maybe even before him.	Aliquam vel ante ipsum.
But he was in it.	Sed in erat erat.
I don't see how it helps.	Non video quomodo id adiuvet.
By much, much.	DE MULTO MULTO.
Now we can't anymore.	Iam non possumus amplius.
It probably wasn't.	Verisimile non fuit.
Nothing was enough.	Nihil satis erat.
it should be .	debet esse .
if he	si ille.
You don't have, you know.	Non habes, scis.
He doesn't want time either.	Vel nec tempus velit.
And there is only one great.	Et una tantum est magna.
She did pretty sure.	Illa satis certo fecit.
No one saw anything coming.	Aliquid nemo vidit venire.
Today I can't.	Hodie non possum.
You don't need me.	Non opus est mihi.
It seems not to be.	Videtur non esse.
I don't even know that.	Ne id quidem scio.
Exactly like that.	Prorsus ut id.
Yes, it is fun.	Etiam, sit amet.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
Now he does.	Nunc facit.
Would be.	Facturum esse.
I was before.	ante fui.
But he knows the problem.	Sed ille quidem scit quaestionem.
To say so.	Ita dicere.
Excellent indeed.	Optime quidem.
But his father does not wish to do so.	Pater autem eius hoc facere non vult.
It almost seemed not enough.	Non satis fere videbatur.
The problem was, you could not tell.	Quaestio erat, nescire.
At length he spoke to him.	Tandem dixit ei.
Don't come to my room.	Noli venire ad cubiculum meum.
He could not.	Non potuit.
Do it for yourself.	Fac ut pro te.
You are not yet there.	Nondum ibi es.
Hardly for him.	Eo vix.
Not much if you can.	Nec multum, si potes.
I'm the one right now.	Im ille nunc.
Who it is for us.	Quis sit nobis.
don't help either.	Non auxilium vel.
I can't live without you.	Sine te vivere non possum.
He could never really say no more.	Numquam vere dicere potuit, non amplius.
This could not have been good.	Hoc bonum esse non potuit.
As stated above.	Ut et dictum est.
But it's too late.	Sed ut sero est.
He is not talking to me.	Non mihi loquitur.
Not someone she doesn't even know.	Non aliquis illa ne scit quidem.
It could be done again.	Fieri iterum potuit.
Maybe not.	Aliquam nec.
This is now.	Hoc nunc est.
I will speak again.	Iterum dicam.
If you are	Si tu es.
You just do your job.	Vos iustus facere officium tuum.
But that is what he wants.	Sed id est velit.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
And who is still some.	Et quis adhuc aliquam.
But I never regret it.	Sed numquam paenitet.
i'm not sick.	non sum male.
I don't like to think too much either.	Non amo nimium cogitare, vel.
All you can be yourself.	Omnes potes esse tibi.
I could not see it, I could not hear it.	eam videre non potui, eam audire non potui.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
There was too little work.	Parum opus fuit.
Not sure about that.	Non certus de illo.
What he did.	Quod fecit.
the boy asked.	quaesivit puer.
Be busy here.	Hic occupatus erit.
And it is better to go.	Et melius ut.
Let me say something.	Dicam aliquid.
He would do it.	Facturum id.
You are alone.	Solus es.
I need to tell you everything.	Mihi opus est tibi omnia dicere.
You don't want me anymore.	Non vis amplius vis.
To the.	Ad rem.
I'd like to see both again.	Libet videre utrumque iterum.
Same thing again.	Idem iterum.
I can't get enough.	Non possum satis.
And probably nothing was.	Et verisimiliter nihil fuit.
This has been done well.	Hoc bene factum est.
I can always go on like this.	Non possum sic semper ire.
It's probably not a good thing.	Probabiliter aliquid non est bonum.
I don't even know how it can be done.	Nescio quidem quomodo id fieri possit.
Something's wrong here.	Aliquid hic mali est.
He has time and many things.	Tempus habet, et multa.
not yet.	nondum.
I just didn't think I would do this.	Modo non putavi hoc facturum esse.
But it doesn't seem likely.	Sed verisimile non videtur.
The boy is like that.	Puer similis est.
I actually work on it.	Ut vere opus in illo.
Now is the time.	Nunc id tempus est.
I needed what I could give.	Mihi opus erat quod dare potui.
You must have made a trip for me.	Debes iter pro me fecisse.
But still it is good that you can know or do.	Sed tamen bonum est quod scire vel facere potes.
So that's one thing.	Ita unum illud.
I know who.	Scio qui.
I am much better.	Ego multo melius.
I can't see this.	Non possum hoc videre.
I don't know you.	Non te novi.
But he could not think.	Sed cogitare non potuit.
He did not know who he was.	Nesciebat quis.
I think it was against him.	Puto in eum fuisse.
He does not say anything.	Non dicit quid.
There is no one behind us.	Nemo post nos est.
Time however.	Tempus tamen.
still not getting.	Adhuc non questus.
But yours is different.	Sed tuum est aliud.
That will be good.	Quod bonum erit.
I have a lot to say.	Multum habeo dicere.
But generally.	Sed fere.
Tell me what's happened to the day.	Die mihi quid acciderit.
So he asked me.	Ita me rogavit.
We are better than this.	Melius hoc sumus.
Do you think that anything will happen?	Putasne quicquam futurum esse ?
But neither will he.	Sed nec velit.
Work hasn't started yet.	Opus adhuc non incepit.
She never went to school.	Illa numquam in scholam abiit.
He wanted to believe.	Credere voluit.
Between this and this.	Inter hoc et hoc.
No one knew what he was doing there alone.	Nemo sciebat quid solus ibi faceret.
He did not.	Non fecit.
You don't need me to help.	Et non debes me adiuvare.
i have something to say.	habeo aliquid dicere.
But now you know.	Nunc autem scis.
He also doesn't want that.	Etiam non velit quam.
Yes to that.	Ita ad illud.
What to stop?	Quod prohibere!
which I just heard I could not.	quod modo audivi non potui.
Never want to be friends with you!	Numquam vis amicos esse tecum!
You are a man.	Homo es.
Being able to do something to help.	Esse aliquid posset ut adiuvet.
Thus he did.	Sic fecit.
And you know, we can't do this too much.	Et tu scis, hoc nimium facere non possumus.
it is certain for me to do one thing.	certum est mihi unum facere.
Not to him.	Non sibi.
I didn't say anything.	Dicere non.
There is no need.	Ibi non opus est.
I thought you were.	Putavi esse te.
He did not know what he meant to say.	Nesciebat quid dicere vellet.
No but very important.	Nulla sed ipsum magna.
Play is to play if you like.	Ludere est agere, si placet.
i'd like to go.	ire libet.
The film is said to be great.	In sit amet dictum magna.
That's what he's saying.	Id ipsum loquitur.
So it comes to mind.	Ita occurrit.
I could scarcely, I could scarcely think.	Vix potui, vix potui cogitare.
No one ever said it to me.	Nemo mihi umquam dixit.
You could do these things.	Vos haec facere posse.
I can do this.	Hoc facere possum.
You know, my boy is a good boy.	Scis, puer meus, puer bonus est.
This is to be yourself and be sure.	Hoc est esse te et esse certus.
It is not easy.	Non facile.
The former has nothing to do with it, nothing to it.	Illa nihil ad hoc, nihil ad illud.
I was okay with that.	Cum bene essem.
That's all about, boy.	Id fere omnes, puer.
Do your job in every way.	Tuum fac in omnibus officium.
at least he had no time.	certe tempus non habuit.
This has to stop.	Hoc habet prohibere.
I've always seen you behind me.	Ego semper post me vidi.
nothing perhaps.	nihil fortasse.
It wasn't hard at all.	Ita omnino non erat difficile.
If possible.	Si fieri potest.
If there is room, we have it.	Si cubiculum est, habemus illud.
This will be the job.	Hic officium erit.
I just can't be there right now.	Modo non potest ibi nunc.
He doesn't want to know the name.	Nomen scire non vult.
I would like to talk to you.	tecum loqui vellem.
You are still my boy.	Adhuc puer meus es tu.
Much time.	Multum temporis.
What he said is true.	Verum est quod dixit.
I don't know how to do this.	Hoc facere nescio.
But that day never came.	Sed illa dies numquam venit.
But he could do nothing.	Sed nihil potuit.
TO THE FATHER	AD PATER.
I know for sure you will do just fine.	Pro certo scio te solum bene facturum.
Well it wasn't.	Bene non erat.
He told me that I had nothing to do with him.	Dixit mihi ut nihil ei.
It was something to say.	Erat aliquid dicere.
that is today.	id est hodie.
I want you to know this for sure.	id pro certo scire te volo.
This was bad enough for him.	Satis hoc ei malum fuit.
What we don't already have.	Quod iam non habemus.
Now you know what you are.	Nunc scis quid sis.
To be.	Esse.
he left me alone.	me solum reliquit.
i'm really fine.	Im 'vere bene.
I know so well.	Tam bene novi.
It is.	Est.
Certainly I am nothing else.	Certe nihil aliud sum.
he has	' habet '.
I can't do it alone.	Solus id facere non possum.
But this does not apply to him.	Sed hoc non est de illo.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
I'll tell you what happened.	Dicam quid acciderit.
I don't even know what it is.	Nescio quidem quid sit.
If he says not yet, he says this.	Si nondum dicit, hoc dicit.
He is not good, but there.	Non sit bonus, sed ibi.
And yet someone can act.	Et tamen aliquis possit agere.
I need to go and see him.	Mihi necesse est ire et videre eum.
That certainly was.	Quod certe fuit.
It's already.	Est' iam.
i didn't think.	non putavi.
It was also very good.	Erat etiam valde bona.
If it is not good, it is not evil.	Si non est bonum, non est malum.
He didn't want to hear it now.	Noluit modo audire.
Has a job.	Habet officium.
It was generally not enough.	Parum fere fuit.
He gave me.	Dedit me.
Nothing pleases me too much.	Nihil nimium placet.
You are the one who is not.	Tu es ille qui non est.
As in no other than that.	Ut in nulla quam.
You have all right.	Recte habes.
It's time to always be out.	Aliquam a semper ex.
Yes there is no more.	Ita non est amplius.
I've been up for a long time.	Fui usque diu.
He wanted to speak.	Voluit dicere.
Only one thing is certain.	Unum solum certum est.
What's the matter.	Quid ad rem.
And it is always hard to hear.	Et semper difficile est audire.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
But I suspect.	Sed suspicor.
That's who he was himself.	Ut quis erat ipsum.
It certainly wasn't long.	Certe non diu fuit.
He wants nothing to do with anything.	Qui nihil velit aliquid.
It was still early.	Mane adhuc erat.
That's what I always do.	Id semper facio.
Now who wished he was.	Nunc quis velit erat.
Do what you love yourself.	Facere quod te ipsum.
Well, pretty much.	Bene, satis multa.
I'm not the only one who looks right now.	Non sum solus qui nunc spectat.
This was the first time.	Hoc primum fuit.
But not great.	Sed nec magna.
Her advice seemed pretty good.	Ei consilium satis bonum videbatur.
Not even a little.	Ne parum quidem.
We can't do it alone.	Id solum facere non possumus.
Not long.	Non diu.
He was mine too.	Meus quoque erat.
It looks like it will be soon.	Is vultus amo non cito erit.
It is very late.	Sero admodum est.
What is this?	Quid hoc est?
That may help.	Quod ut adiuvet.
But he does not seem to do this.	Hoc tamen facere non videtur.
Not much, but I like it.	Non multum, sed placet.
He could never buy what he said.	Numquam potuit emere quod dixit.
You do the same.	Idem facis.
I have everything to do.	Habeo omnia facere.
I don't know enough.	Parum nescio.
He barely saw her.	Vix vidit eam.
That's for sure.	Certo id.
He knew me too.	Me quoque ille sciebat.
That's gonna be great.	Ut sit amet magna.
I've never seen it so late in the year.	Nunquam tam sero vidi in anno.
But he could not give it now.	Sed non potuit eam nunc dare.
You can see nothing wrong with me anymore.	Te videre potes nihil mali apud me amplius.
He did not know why, but it was too late.	Nesciebat quare, sed sero fuit.
No one saw him do it.	Nemo eum facere vidit.
I know who has done this.	Scio qui hoc fecerit.
it was not good.	non erat bonum.
What do you have?.	Quae habes ?.
He knew he could not win.	Sciebat se vincere non posse.
See you soon!	Vide te mox!.
We do it again.	Nos illud.
Why	Cur.
I can't say you're right there either.	Non possum dicere te ibi esse vel recte.
Don't buy too much.	Non nimis emere.
We need both.	Utrumque opus est nobis.
Used to be OK.	Bene esse solebat.
Maybe not the best way to do it.	Forsitan non optime facere.
I see this when it comes to him.	Quod ipsum etiam ex video.
He was not prepared for this.	Ad id paratus non erat.
As it was said.	Ut dictum erat.
And	Et.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
He knew better.	Melius sciebat.
Nothing new here.	Nihil novi hic.
I don't feel right about it.	Non recte de illo sentio.
I hope it does.	Spero facit.
It was morning.	Mane erat.
I could not stay.	manere non potui.
It could not have been done so much.	Tantum fieri non potuit.
I've heard so much.	Audivi tantum.
He was not.	Non erat.
I don't think it was.	Non puto fuisse.
He wants her.	Ut velit eius.
I just can't help it.	Modo non possum illum.
There is no one out here.	Nulla quis ex hic.
Nothing else.	Nihil aliud.
Only yourself.	Solum ipsum.
That's never been done before.	Id numquam ante.
He could not save him.	Posset quidem illum nisi.
Which of course is not correct.	Quod quidem non recte.
That's how to do it yourself.	Ut id quam ipsum.
I don't suspect.	Non suspicor.
You know this is true.	Tu scis hoc verum est.
I really made this decision.	Ego vere hoc consilium feci.
I could not be.	Non potui esse.
That's it.	Id id.
But that's the same thing.	Ut id ipsum nisi.
That's not true.	Ut 'non est verum.
You are a busy person.	Tu es homo occupatus.
This is not bad.	Non est hoc malum.
He didn't want me to tell you.	Noluit me tibi dicere.
but he knew what he was doing.	sed sciebat quid faceret.
I've never heard anything like that.	Nunquam quicquam simile audivi.
I love myself.	Me amo.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
What he wished to give to him.	Quod ei dare vellet.
I could not have done it.	Fieri non potui.
I don't like you.	Non placet tibi.
I need to go.	Ire debeo.
It was good.	Erat bonum.
It's not okay.	Non bene esse.
I didn't know what it was.	Nesciebam quid esset.
I would probably do the same.	Probabiliter ut idem faceret.
I don't know whether it is true or not.	Nescio an verum sit vel non.
He wants you to know.	Scire te vult.
Maybe not always save.	Aliquam non semper nisi.
i would like to.	vellem.
He told me how to find a plan.	Dixit mihi quomodo invenire consilium.
The time has not come for it.	Tempus non venit ad id.
If you don't want to go.	Si vis non ire.
This is not true at all.	Hoc omnino non est verum.
I don't want to do that.	Nolo facere.
I hope so.	Spero ita.
I'm afraid to talk to him.	Vereor ei loqui.
To save yourself.	Ut ipsum nisi.
Well not really.	Bene non vere.
Her father loves her.	Pater eam amat.
But that is not here.	Quod autem hic non sit.
But there was no time.	Sed non tempus erat.
Nothing you need to do.	Nihil debes facere.
No one can speak to us.	Nemo nobis dicere potest.
Now I can see.	Nunc videre possum.
I know he was just doing his job.	Scio se solum suum officium facere.
And he?	Ille autem?
He knows what.	Scit quid.
It's up to us to do it.	Facere nobis est.
I do not like.	Mihi non placet.
I am alone.	Solus sum.
And we all are now.	Et nos omnes qui nunc sunt.
Or mine, that's the thing.	Vel mea, id rem.
It's you.	Suus vobis.
Nothing else to say.	Nihil aliud dicere.
I have to talk to her.	Habeo loqui ad eam.
He wants me to be there.	Ibi me non vult.
But you can never be too sure.	Sed nimium certe numquam potes esse.
I did not know why or how.	nesciebam quare vel quomodo.
In us there is none.	In nobis nulla.
It's time to get some please.	Aliquam ut aliquam velit.
It is he who made it.	Ipse tamen est qui fecit illud.
What makes people really men?	Quid facit homines vere homines?
I don't want to think anything.	Nolo aliquid cogitare.
That was not enough for me.	Id mihi parum fuit.
And what was it?	Et quid fuit.
He refused to do anything.	Noluit aliquid.
If you do, you are not.	Si facis, non es.
He did not.	Non fecit.
Well indeed not.	Bene quidem non.
I have help.	Habeo auxilium.
This.	Hic.
I would like to help you.	Vellem te adiuvare.
will not be enough.	Non erit satis.
They are	Sunt
He inquired of her.	Quaesivit eam.
I can't talk to you right now.	Non possum dicere tibi nunc.
You can do it.	Ad id potes.
to what else? 	ad aliud quid!
He could not find them.	Illa invenire non potuit.
I can go.	Ire possum.
He's one.	Ille unum.
Please give me good advice.	Placet mihi dare consilium bonum.
And	Et .
But he did not know.	Nesciebat, sed.
Even he was not himself.	Etiam non erat ipsum.
I've never seen him before.	Nunquam ante illum vidi.
He did not find anything.	Non fecit aliquid invenire.
Hardly anyone has seen it.	Vix quis vidit id.
If it pleases you.	Si placet vobis.
Maybe it was something else entirely.	Fortasse aliud omnino fuit.
We already have a little more.	Nos jam paulo plus .
I'm not really sure.	Non sum certus vere.
He certainly got it.	Is certe obtinuit.
Or it used to be.	Vel esse solebat.
It was the same night.	Nocte erat ipsum.
All except us.	Omnes, nisi nos.
Let me tell you a question.	Dicam quaestionem.
But one thing was certain.	Sed unum certum erat.
We can do better.	Melius facere possumus.
I want to go to her.	ad eam ire volo.
But he does not do this.	Non tamen hoc facit.
Now I don't have any.	Nunc non aliquam est.
You can't.	Non potes.
Talk to you about it.	Loqui ad te de eo.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
This has not been done.	Hoc non est factum.
It is a great question.	Magna quaestio est.
So it is, father.	Ita est, pater.
I knew how hard he tried.	Sciebam quam difficile esset conatus.
That seems to be enough.	Id satis esse videtur.
I knew what it was.	Sciebam quid esset.
He could not speak to me.	Mihi loqui non potuit.
And he told him all things.	Et dixit ei omnia.
All good was evil.	Totum bonum malum erat.
He could not be there.	Non potuit ibi esse.
If yes, nothing.	Si sic, nihil.
I will tell you about it.	Dicam tibi de eo.
Where do you want to be.	Ubi vis esse.
it was not well.	non erat bene.
I think a lot of people could.	Homines multum posse puto.
This one is.	Hoc unum est.
I think you're really here to do something.	Puto te vere hic aliquid.
Not sure what was needed.	Certum quod non erat opus.
I don't need to know.	Non opus est scire.
I didn't know what it was.	Ego nesciebam quid esset.
I see this happening.	Hoc video fieri.
I don't mean to be like that.	Non vult ei simile esse.
evil and evil.	& malum malum.
I want to know who did it.	Scire volo quis fecerit.
i want to discuss.	de volo.
You can do this, and you can do it.	Hoc facere potes, et facere potes.
He was not sure how it was done.	Non certus erat quomodo factum est.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
It was not exactly true, but it was enough.	Non prorsus verum erat, sed satis esset.
That's what a man is.	Quod homo quid est.
I know mine does.	Meum novi facit.
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
Time is not enough.	Parum tempus sit.
This is not, and perhaps never will be.	Hoc non est, et fortasse numquam erit.
So here's the thing.	Ita hic res.
Don't think, just act.	Noli cogitare, modo agere.
I don't believe anything else.	Non credo aliud.
One question, however.	Una quaestio, sed.
Almost at the same time.	Fere simul.
My father could not know.	Pater meus scire non potuit.
That was the same thing.	Id ipsum erat.
I have the money.	Habeo pecuniam.
The whole thing again.	Totum iterum.
And so he did.	Et sic fecit.
I don't want her money.	Pecuniam eius nolo.
Even from time to time.	De tempore etiam.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I wish I could do the same.	Idem vellem.
It's something to see.	Est aliquid videre.
I know who this is.	Scio qui hoc sit.
he saw nothing.	nihil vidit.
I just see you as yourself.	Modo te video sicut te ipsum.
No one knew anything.	Nemo aliquid scivit.
But it is not so at all.	Sed omnino non ita est.
It was not for us.	Non erat nobis.
Been busy lately.	Nuper fuit occupatus.
And see there.	Et vide ibi.
I want to give you even more.	Volo tibi etiam plus dare.
It could not be done!	Fieri non potuit!
perhaps even today.	fortasse etiam hodie.
That was hard for me.	Id mihi difficile erat.
It is.	Sic est.
But not him here or any.	Sed non ipsum hic vel aliquam.
I haven't seen you lately.	Non vidi te nuper.
It was not like this before.	Sic ante non erat.
Now it is.	Modo sit.
Never, but.	Numquam, sed.
But it is not possible.	Sed id non potest.
One did not understand.	Unum non intellexit.
But this is not enough.	Sed hoc non satis est.
Is that what it looks like?	Estne id quod spectat simile?
Good to hear this too.	Hoc quoque bonum est audire.
That's what it always was.	Ut id semper erat.
If you want to do it, well.	Si id facere vis, bene.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
This is my plan.	Hoc est meum consilium.
I know myself.	Novi me.
Yes that was always.	Etiam id semper erat.
But this will always be.	Sed hoc semper erit.
But one thing seems probable.	Sed unum videtur probabile.
I was too busy.	Etiam occupatus eram.
Here's the question.	Hic est quaestio.
I could not see.	videre non potui.
And so stop trying.	Et sic conatur prohibere.
And we.	Et nos.
Now it's a pretty good thing.	Iam res satis bona est.
My husband could not be with me.	Vir meus mecum esse non potuit.
This is where he can help us.	Hoc est, ubi nos adiuvet.
He knows.	Scit.
Who wants but wants.	Velit sed velit quis.
Your help is so much to me.	Tantum est auxilium tuum ad me.
never, never thought of you.	numquam, numquam te putavi.
Where there is need	Ubi opus est.
I can barely hear.	Vix audire possum.
I am good, though.	Sum bonus, sed.
He never knew exactly why.	Prorsus cur numquam scivit.
I was almost alone alone.	Solus fere solus eram.
You need to know what that is.	Quid id sit debes scire.
For some or for him.	Aliquam vel ipsum enim.
I didn't think it would happen.	Non putavi fore.
Certainly nothing is there.	Certe nihil est ibi.
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
He also likes himself.	Etiam ipsum velit.
It looks pretty good.	Spectat satis bonum.
Well, you don't like it.	Bene, tibi non placet.
much more than he was.	multo quam ille erat.
The first one is good.	Primum bonum unum.
I wanted myself.	Volui me.
No but no great things.	Nulla sed magna nulla.
No one wants to go on.	Ut in velit nulla.
But now he is, when he wants to be himself.	Nunc autem est, cum velit, ut ipsum.
Nothing is possible.	Nihil potest.
Make sure all is well.	Fac omnia bene esse.
Get a car.	Accipere currus.
I tried everything.	Conatus sum de omnibus.
I really need to talk to him.	Mihi vere opus est loqui ei.
To buy, to buy, to buy.	Emere, emere, emere.
But we have plenty of time together.	Sed tempus habemus multa simul.
It has been there for a long time.	Diu ibi fuit.
If not, let it be.	Nisi, sit.
We cannot accept this.	Non possumus hoc accipere.
He's with us.	Hic nobiscum est.
This is certainly true.	Hoc certe verum est.
I know what you mean.	Scio quid vis.
There are many.	Multa sunt.
It's not bad.	Malum non est.
I am that man.	Ego sum ille homo.
if not today, tomorrow, soon	si non hodie, cras, mox.
Everyone knows.	Novit omnes.
I'll tell you now.	Dicam modo.
Look at him!	Illum vide!
I think both are true.	utrumque verum puto.
He was not a teacher, but a teacher.	Non magister, sed magister erat.
But this time again.	Sed id tempus iterum.
And no one did anything about him.	Et nemo de illo aliquid fecit.
Make time for it.	Fac tempus est.
Without you we can't have one.	Sine te unum habere non possumus.
If you want it.	Quod si vis eam.
You all.	Vos omnes.
She could have something to give.	Posset habere aliquid dare.
I don't want you to understand.	Nolo te intelligere.
You can stay.	Manere potes.
I have great things to do.	Habeo magna facere.
She refused to accept it.	Illa accipere noluit eam accipere.
He has no interest.	Rem non habet.
I'm going to help you.	Eo tibi auxilio.
However, it cannot be evil.	Tamen malum esse non potest.
It was not today.	Hodie non fuit.
Maybe even next year.	Fortasse etiam anno.
Yes exactly.	Ita prorsus.
You still do business.	Adhuc rem facere.
Can't stop at all.	Omnino prohibere non potest.
Nothing at all has been done.	Nihil omnino factum est.
But he knew what his job was.	Sed quid eius officium esset sciebat.
Maybe that was the time, though.	Aliquam id tempus erat, sed.
This is no longer there.	Hoc iam non est.
He also knew that something bad was going to happen.	Malum etiam futurum sciebat.
I have advice for you and me.	Habeo consilium pro me et te.
It's your problem.	Est tibi quaestio.
Knows what you need.	Scit quid tibi opus sit.
I can do this job easily.	Facile hoc officium facere possum.
I don't know well.	Non bene scio.
What he was up to.	Quod erat ad.
Traveling if possible.	Iter si fieri potest.
We don't have to be with him.	Non cum eum qui nobis ad.
But we cannot have it.	Sed id habere non possumus.
You should not leave early.	Non debes mane relinquere.
The father knew this.	Pater hoc scivit.
It's a house	Est domum
Tell me what you mean.	Dic quid vis me esse.
Yes I don't need it.	Ita non opus est.
Not the first time.	Non primum.
Please leave your dog at home.	Canem tuum domi relinquere quaeso.
This has been done.	Hoc factum est.
But not for me.	Sed non pro me.
I had not much in it.	Multum in eo non habui.
I beg him.	Quaeso eum.
But as you said, it is a journey.	Sed ut dixisti, iter est.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
There was someone else.	Fuit aliquis.
Not for him.	Non ei.
One of you will be one.	Unus ex vobis unus erit.
I am very good at my job.	Ego sum valde bona apud me officium.
I am very glad.	valde gaudeo.
Either to us or	Vel nobis vel.
It's probably none.	Verisimile nulla est.
Not alone, this boy.	Nec solus, hic puer.
never thought of.	numquam cogitavi.
There's nothing in it except it.	Nulla in enim nisi.
And that was it.	Erat et id.
I don't know whether we're still alive now.	Nescio an nunc adhuc sumus.
He did not do everything right.	Non omnia recte fecit.
Yes, that's it.	Etiam ut ipsum est.
Earlier this week.	Hac septimana ante.
I really like my job.	Ego vere amo meum officium.
One when you've done something wrong.	Unus, cum aliquid mali feceris.
I can do it better than I can.	Id melius quam potest possum.
And he would really say something.	Et hoc vere dicere aliquid.
It is not too difficult, but it is too easy.	Non nimis difficile est sed nimis facile est.
It is certain, make me today.	Certum est, fac me hodie.
But I'm still a boy.	Sed adhuc puer vidi.
But I see yours.	Video tamen tuum .
I'm still the same guy.	Ego tamen idem guy.
This is enough for me.	Hoc mihi satis est.
And he did it.	Et fecit.
I told him that there was no more.	dixi ei quod amplius non esset.
It is not that He gave anything.	Non est quod ipse aliquid dedit.
Yes they really are the same.	Ita vere idem sunt.
And this is the question.	Quaestio autem haec est.
You are probably.	Probabiliter es.
That's not what this post is about.	Quod post haec non est de.
Actually, really, I hope so.	Vere, vere, spero sic.
You can always talk to me.	Mihi semper loqui potes.
Well almost none.	Bene fere nemo.
Tomorrow some.	Cras aliquam.
You don't need to come here.	Non debes huc venire.
I had to go.	Ire non habui.
I think I will play again.	Puto iterum ludere.
No how, no.	Nulla quam, nulla.
I have been there for years.	Ibi annos fui.
He has no friends.	Amicos non habet.
We have a lot of work to do.	Multum opus habemus facere.
We don't have anything to do with it.	Non habemus quid ad rem.
Just like yesterday.	Sicut heri.
Now I feel better.	Iam melius sentio.
He seems to be still alive.	Videtur adhuc vivere.
I wanted to talk to you.	tecum loqui volui.
This one is enough.	Hoc unum satis est.
I'm sure these are pretty good.	Pro certo habeo haec multa satis bona esse.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
he speaks no more of him today.	non amplius hodie in eo loquitur.
The same for me.	Ipse mihi.
I haven't had it yet.	Non habui adhuc.
I don't feel mine.	Meum non sentio.
Maybe she didn't know either.	Fortasse nesciebat vel.
Or as it seems.	Vel ut videtur.
I always have a plan with me.	Semper habeo consilium mecum.
What have you done.	Quid fecisti.
But there is none at all.	Sed non est nulla.
But now look at something else.	Sed nunc aliud vide.
I can find it again.	Iterum invenire possum.
She didn't know what to do.	Quid faceret illa nesciebat.
Man.	Vir.
I heard about him.	de illo audivi.
Exactly the same.	Prorsus idem.
Do it yourself.	Fac tibi.
I want to help you.	Volo te adiuvare.
I wanted to tell you something.	Aliquid tibi dicere volui.
It's too early.	Nimis mane est.
He does well.	Bene facit.
I never wanted to see that.	Numquam videre volui ut.
I do not know.	Non scio.
But not all.	Sed non omnia.
But he already knew enough.	Sed satis iam sciebat.
I never understood.	Numquam intellexit.
That's what happened here.	Id quod hic factum est.
I hardly know.	vix me scio.
It will be fine for you.	Bene erit tibi.
Tell me.	Dic mihi.
He can't seem just.	Videri non potest iustus.
Well, not exactly.	Bene, non prorsus.
It's hard indeed.	Difficile quidem.
Nothing but this.	Nihil nisi hoc.
It was great to do.	Multum facere.
It's in you.	In te est.
Nothing and everything.	Nihil et omnia.
Maybe you did.	Fortasse fecisti.
I think we are a lot better.	Puto nos multum melius esse.
He didn't want to know now.	Noluit nunc scire.
It's not a lot of time.	Non multum temporis est.
But not enough.	Sed nec satis.
i love you a lot.	multum amo.
I hope you win tonight.	Spero te hac nocte vincere.
This was the man.	Hic erat vir.
And it is not.	Et non est.
but at some time.	in aliquo tamen tempore.
But it is not.	Sed non est enim.
But that's how it is.	Sed id ipsum quam.
He didn't want to talk about it.	Noluit loqui de eo.
What time is it?	Quid tempus est?
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
There was nothing like it.	Non erat id ut sit.
As you like.	Ut libet.
Men don't matter.	Homines non rem.
Yes and he wants nothing.	Etiam et velit nisi.
She's "at lunch" on this one.	Illa "ad prandium" de hoc est.
I was there.	ibi essem.
He said nothing of this.	Dixit hoc nihil.
It probably was.	Probabile fuit.
He could probably leave this time.	Probabiliter tempus relinquere non potuit.
He is the same.	Ipse est.
Nothing like before or after.	Nihil umquam simile, ante vel post.
It doesn't take long to do.	Non diu facere.
But also.	Sed et.
it was only.	tantum erat.
I don't want to be.	Nolo me esse.
Now be very happy.	Nunc sit amet ipsum.
All you can do is just be there.	Omnes facere potes iustus est ibi.
I don't want to do so.	Nolo id.
I wonder which one.	Miror quod unum.
there was so much to see.	tantum erat videre.
It was hard to find someone.	Non fuit difficile invenire aliquem.
Do you need to be there?	Putasne opus esse illuc?
That is, there is something wrong.	Hoc est, mali aliquid est.
Something to win.	Aliquid vincere.
All I want people to do.	Omnia quae homines facere volo.
I know you believe me.	Scio me tibi credere.
Or in it.	Vel in est.
This was the first time.	Hoc primum fuit.
And she, indeed, when she met him.	Et illa quidem, cum illa occurrit.
I quite like something.	Mihi satis placet aliquid.
He knows this.	Scit hoc.
He will do anything for me.	Mihi quicquam facturus est.
What are you doing tonight?	Quid facis hac nocte?
It is certain.	Certum est.
He told us it was so good to be home.	Tam bene esse domi, dixit nobis.
But that's always how.	Sed id semper quam.
I have heard of this.	Audivi de hoc.
My problem is here and now.	Mihi quaestio hic et nunc est.
You're not getting it.	Non questus es.
I want something for you.	Volo quod tibi.
You have done very well.	Optime fecisti.
This cannot be true.	Hoc verum esse non potest.
It is very hard to find.	Est admodum invenire.
That probably isn't.	Quod verisimile non est.
That was a good job.	Bonum erat id officium.
I know what you like but.	Scio quid simile, sed.
Not that kind.	Non id genus.
It's not very important.	Etiam non ipsum magna.
I know nothing else.	Nihil aliud scio.
He came from behind.	Venit post.
I said, it was a thing.	Dixi, res erat.
i know how to do it.	quam facere scio.
But probably not.	Sed verisimile non est.
One at a time.	Unum tempore.
I just did my job.	Ego iustus fecit officium meum.
We have all day.	Totum diem habemus.
It was a great success.	Res magna fuit.
Well, you still have a little time.	Bene, parum temporis adhuc habes.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
But this is nothing new.	Sed hoc nihil novi est.
I hope all is well.	Spero enim omnes optime.
He's been here long enough.	Satis hic diu est.
But I don't think so.	Non puto te, sed.
Now, that's why you're here.	Nunc, ut quid hic sis.
We have dinner.	Cenam habemus.
I don't need much to talk about.	Non multum opus est loqui.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
This guy is kind.	Hoc genus guy est.
I don't know how.	Nescio quomodo.
Would you like to help with dinner?	Visne cenam adiuvare?
I don't want this.	Nolo hoc.
He ought to know more.	Plus scire debet.
all at once.	Omnes simul.
He could not say anything else.	Non potuit aliud dicere.
He wanted him to know.	Scire eum voluit.
Maybe that's it.	Aliquam id est.
But he does not know what it is about him.	Sed quid de se sit nescit.
Great things are never great.	Numquam magna magna.
But it was too bad.	Tamen etiam malum erat.
You want to know what you think.	Scire te putas quid velis.
what do you want more?	Quid vis amplius?
I just don't.	Modo ne.
No one says.	Nemo dicit.
I knew nothing.	nihil sciebam.
In the house	In domum.
There is nothing to say.	Dicere nihil est.
But that which cannot be.	Id autem quod esse non potest.
I just don't know how.	Modo nescio quomodo.
He didn't think so.	Non putabat.
he saw all things.	vidit omnia.
There was not much to say.	Multum dicere non fuit.
It is necessary to go.	Necesse est ire.
She wants to see you so much.	Tantum te videre vult illa.
He soon departed.	Is mox abiit.
But this does not seem to help.	Sed id adiuvare non videtur.
I didn't tell anyone about this.	Aliquis de hoc non dixi.
What happened to us?	Quid inter nos acciderit.
And you are.	Et tu es.
Yes, I don't know whether I'll do it.	Etiam nescio an id faciam.
Which is so bad that it has been done.	Quod tam malum est, quod factum est.
I do not think.	Non puto.
Man and dog.	Homo et canis.
I don't like to say that.	Non placet dicere.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
he would not go.	ire nolebat.
No one knows.	Nemo scit.
I'm there.	Ibi sum.
I thought about it for a long time.	de illo diu cogitavi.
He knows something so far.	Scit aliquid usque.
He would not come.	Noluit venire.
That was somehow good.	Quod erat aliquo modo bonum.
If not for me.	Si non mihi.
But not in this.	Sed non in hac.
Or to yourself.	Vel ad te ipsum.
To a great extent.	Ad magna.
And who knows, perhaps it is.	Et quis scit, fortasse est.
No one wants it.	Nulla id ipsum velit.
This evil is like nothing he'd ever had.	Hoc malum est sicut nihil aliud semper habuit.
And not my father.	Nec pater.
But instead of.	Sed pro.
It is done.	Factum est.
Can't wait until after this.	Post hoc manere non potest.
Now it seems to be working.	Nunc opus esse videtur.
Now, however, this is not working.	Nunc tamen hoc non est opus.
This is not at all.	Hoc omnino non est.
Without it, you have nothing.	Sine, nihil habes.
And it is.	Et est.
I just can't hear you now.	Modo possum te audire nunc.
That teacher is always late.	Sero semper est, magister ille.
It is not only for us.	Etiam non nisi nobis.
I don't say that right now.	Non quod iam.
It looks good.	Non spectat bonum.
I'm sorry for it.	Paenitet te per illum.
Not great.	Nec magna.
I could not believe it.	Credere non potui.
It is done.	Factum est.
Exactly as.	Prorsus ut.
It was very early.	Fuit valde mane.
Yes that is.	Etiam id est.
What's it like?	Quid simile?
It just doesn't look good.	Hoc modo non spectat bonum.
That's not enough.	Quod non satis est.
It is good.	Bene est.
What to me? 	Quid ad me?
I'd say nothing.	Dicere vellem nihil.
I wanted to play and he wasn't sure how.	Ludere certo modo vellem et erat.
Not already.	Non iam.
Never again.	Numquam iterum.
I don't like to talk about work.	Non sicut opus est dicere.
I have done it myself again.	me ipsum adhuc feci.
And he does very well.	Et optime facit.
There is nothing there.	Nihil est ibi.
You really want me to stay.	Vis me manere vere.
Nothing bad.	Nisi malum.
Nor yet.	Nec tamen.
No one can do it alone.	Nemo id solum facere potest.
I have been there for a while.	Ibi ad tempus fui.
I do not do these things.	Non haec facio.
This was a little while ago.	Hoc paulo ante fuit.
That's it now.	Id nunc est.
At last he came to her.	Tandem venit ad eam.
I can see that you do.	Videre possum ut facias.
This got it.	Hoc obtinuit.
I don't know what else.	Nescio quid aliud.
That's it before now.	Ut id nunc ante.
That morning.	Id mane.
He is a 'can' guy.	Is 'potest' guy.
Now what? 	Iam quid?
he thought.	putavit.
Not nearly enough.	Nec fere satis.
Not all indeed.	Non omnes quidem.
Even now it is.	Etiam nunc est.
It is done, it is done.	Factum est, factum est.
But tell me that you may do something more.	Sed dic ut aliquid amplius facias.
Not long.	Non diu.
We too.	Nos quoque.
He didn't want to think about it now.	Noluit nunc de eo cogitare.
This will be successful.	Hic erit felix.
so I wanted.	sic volui.
I can't talk to him.	Non possum dicere ei.
This is not easy.	Hoc non est facile.
tell me, tell me.	dic, dic mihi.
It's good enough, and sure enough.	Satis bonus est, et certus satis erit.
I don't think there is yet.	Non puto ibi adhuc esse.
But he's coming to you.	Hic tamen ad te venit.
I wish you better tomorrow.	Melius cras volo.
Everybody tried to get there.	Omnes conatus est illuc venire.
that he could not do it.	id se facere non posse.
But I've never seen it before.	Sed id numquam ante.
But great things are great.	Sed magna magna.
Say you're all well.	Dic tibi omnia bene esse.
I have this.	Hoc habeo.
Certainly he never did so.	Certe nunquam sic fecit.
not a lot of time.	non multum temporis.
It is not probable, however.	Probabile non est, sed.
Get this advice if you want.	Id consilium, si vis.
But see this.	Sed hoc vide.
But who wants him.	Sed quis velit ipsum.
He wanted more, much more.	Plus voluit, multo plus.
Certainly no one said anything.	Nemo certe, nihil dixit.
It is not with me.	Non est mecum.
So glad you're here.	Ita gaudeo te hic esse.
And what no one has seen is not necessary.	Et quod nemo vidit, non est necesse.
I think it was.	Puto fuisse.
yes i love you.	Etiam te amo.
And indeed.	Et quidem.
What a journey it was.	Quod iter erat.
It was already a job for both.	Iam ad utrumque officium erat.
Her father told him to take the job.	Pater eius dixit ei officium accipere.
I don't know how to do it.	Nescio quomodo id facere.
And perhaps rightly so.	Et fortasse recte.
I'm sorry if you're not good enough.	Me paenitet si tibi non satis est.
He told him that he could do it.	Dixit ei se posse id facere.
That was true.	Quod erat verum.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
But we can't believe we know how much we need it.	Sed non possumus credere nos scire quantum opus sit.
I'm not sure it was good or not.	Ego certe non erat bonus vel non.
In due time he said all is well.	In tempore dixit omnia bene.
I want to talk to her.	Volo eam loqui.
And tell me where you want to go.	Et dic mihi quo vis ire.
Yes.	Ita.
That's great.	Id magna.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
This is not possible.	Ita fieri non potest.
She doesn't want to go.	Illa ire non vult.
That and it is.	Id et est.
It was not so.	Non ita factum est.
.	.
No longer.	Nec iam.
No one knows what happened there.	Nemo scit quid ibi factum sit.
Appreciate your help.	Bene tuum auxilium.
There is something wrong here.	Est aliquid hic mali.
I don't want to say anything.	Nolo aliquid dicere.
that's too bad.	id malum etiam.
I didn't know what was going to happen to me.	Nesciebam quid mihi futurum sit.
She asked him about him.	Rogavit eum de eo.
I was a man.	Homo fui.
I need to know that you can do it.	Mihi opus est scire te id facere posse.
I am too much.	Nimium ego.
But you don't want it.	Sed non ita vis.
Yes that's how now.	Etiam id quam nunc.
I don't like it.	Id tibi non placet.
I am not speaking.	non sum loqui.
But it is something more.	Sed plus aliquid est.
But not only himself.	Sed non ipsum nisi.
Maybe you need to stay at home today.	Fortasse hodie domi manere debes.
If it is not, nothing has been done.	Si non est, nihil factum est.
Yes it is for me.	Ita est mihi.
I know this to be so.	Scio hoc ita esse.
Or he does it.	Vel facit.
It was very good.	Erat valde bona.
He was a man.	Homo fuit.
In their own way.	Suo modo.
I will not want it.	Nolo volo.
He told him his job.	Dixit ei officium suum.
This morning it's hard to say.	Hoc mane difficile est dicere.
It's not my name.	Non est nomen meum.
I know it.	eam novi.
He could not.	Non potuit.
But I want to give him advice.	Volo tamen consilium ei dare.
i like to do this!	Placet hoc mihi facere?
But it is not so bad as you, man.	Sed non ita mali est, ut tibi, homo.
I'm glad to hear from you.	Gaudeo a te audire.
He left to do so.	Reliquit id.
And so all.	Ita autem omnes.
I am not going to do.	Non sum facturus.
I saw today.	Vidi hodie.
And the race did.	Et genus fecit.
What did he say now?	Quid dixit modo?
You too, man.	Tu quoque, vir.
But he did not.	Sed non fecit.
He is doing well.	Bene agit.
I don't like to hear from you.	Non amo te audire.
But you're not so sure.	Sed non ita certus sis.
I love to talk to people.	Amo loqui ad homines.
You are not alone.	Non solum te.
That's never been done before.	Ut id numquam ante.
Whether he wants money.	Utrum velit pecuniam.
I saw her this morning before breakfast.	Hanc eam mane ante prandium vidi.
I told you where.	Dixi tibi ubi.
My night.	Mea nocte.
No time but now.	Nulla sed tempus nunc.
I just love him.	Modo eum amo.
Again, not so good.	Iterum, non bonus.
He a.	Ipse a.
I just do it.	Modo facturus est.
I'm glad to be here.	Gaudeo te hic esse.
But not for no reason.	Sed non nulla enim.
But not both.	Sed non utrumque.
Which indeed is true.	Quod quidem verum est.
But I don't know what.	Sed ne quid.
I have something wrong.	Habeo aliquid mali.
But yet it is a matter.	Sed tamen res est.
So who knows.	Ita qui scit.
There was no need.	Non opus fuit.
But it is possible.	Sed fieri potest.
But this was good for him.	Sed hoc ei bonum fuit.
That's certainly possible.	Quod certe fieri potest.
We can't say yes.	Etiam dicere non possumus.
I could not do it.	facere non potui.
he could not have both.	utrumque habere non potuit.
This is your plan.	Tuum est consilium.
He comes to us.	Venit ad nos.
but only for you.	sed solum tibi.
I am not the only one who can do it.	Non sum solus qui id facere potest.
I am a teacher.	Ego magister sum.
It was great.	In magna erat.
That's it before.	Ut id ante est.
They'd be home.	Fore domum.
He said nothing to him.	Nihil ei dixit.
Please, just do.	Quaeso, sicut fac.
It is not possible, but we are here.	Fieri non potest, hic tamen sumus.
But probably not.	Sed verisimile non est.
And something else.	Et aliquid aliud.
As you can see it was not.	Ut videre potes quod non fuit.
Get yourself out of it.	Te ipsum ex.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
I've never been out.	Ut numquam ex.
But it was not said.	Sed non dictum erat.
It's time to be in front of you.	Aliquam in erat ante.
Now was the time.	Nunc tempus erat.
I've never been there before today.	Nunquam ibi ante hodie fui.
That could not have been the way you said.	Quod fieri non potuit quomodo dixisti.
It was important to him.	Magna erat ei ut.
And it is.	Et est.
When this was done, it would have nothing to do with it.	Quod cum hoc factum esset, nihil tibi esset.
Excellent indeed.	Optime quidem.
Just not for me.	Iustus non mihi.
It was a really good home.	Erat vere bonus domi.
there was so much help.	tantum auxilium erat.
You have done well.	Bene fecisti.
They're like you and me.	Sunt sicut me et te.
But that's some time before.	Sed id aliquam ante.
Great too.	Magna etiam.
I am the only one who can do this.	Ego sum solus qui hoc facere potest.
He did not even say this.	Ne hoc quidem dixit.
Nothing like that has ever happened.	Nihil simile umquam factum est.
I want to be her.	Volo ut eius sit.
You have to do it.	Facere tibi eum.
They have more money.	Plus pecuniae sunt.
But he did not even see enough.	Sed ne ipse quidem satis vidit.
And I said to him, Not me anymore.	Et dixi ei: Non me amplius.
He was the father.	Pater erat.
but he knew too much.	sed nimium sciebat.
Got his period this morning.	Suum tempus hoc mane obtinuit.
I know you are.	Scio te esse.
But this cannot be.	Sed hoc non potest esse.
But that is not going to happen.	Sed id non est futurum.
Was it not so bad now? 	Iam non tam malum erat?
Probably nothing.	Verisimiliter nihil.
We'd go there.	Ibi nos vellem ire.
It is certain that it will happen soon.	Certum est mox futurum esse.
You know how to do it now.	Scis quomodo id nunc facias.
I had to say someone, somebody.	Dicere aliquem habui, aliquem.
So don't travel to the future.	Ita non iter ad futurum.
No one has seen anything.	Nemo aliquid vidit.
I don't want to talk anymore.	Nolo amplius loqui.
one in the morning, one in the afternoon.	unum mane, unum post meridiem.
Maybe he's too busy.	Forsitan occupatus est.
But it was not said that.	Sed nec dictum ut.
It didn't take long.	Quod non diu.
Again this is good.	Iterum hoc bonum est.
So it is.	Ita est.
He did both well.	Bene utrumque fecit.
I won't tell him now.	Non illum nunc dicam.
not very bad.	Non admodum malum.
That was good too.	Bonum erat id etiam.
It won't be long now.	Non diu nunc erit.
Take a look at it now.	Vide nunc eam.
Say what you want.	Dic quid vis.
Maybe this was really something.	Forsitan vere hic aliquid erat.
i'd like to know what it is.	libet scire quid sit.
not working.	Non opus.
For the first time ever.	Primum semper.
Excellent indeed.	Optime quidem.
I would like to.	Ego vellem.
You can talk about it if you want.	De eo loqui potes si vis.
I'm just getting home.	Im 'iustus questus domum.
But from none.	Sed a nulla ex.
As of now, it's too soon.	Ut nunc, nimis cito est.
I don't mean much here.	Non multum hic vult.
He knew too much what this meant.	Scivit nimium quid hoc esset.
It was time.	Tempus erat.
He was here a little while ago.	Hic paulo ante erat.
I'm glad he's going to be there with me.	Gaudeo eum ibi mecum futurum.
But I don't like that.	Sed non ut quam.
But that's not here.	Sed id non hic.
That was bad enough.	Satis id malum fuit.
I think it's going to be very good.	Optime id futurum puto.
No that's none.	Nulla id nulla.
No but him.	Nulla sed ipsum.
I want to do that too.	id quoque facere volo.
I need to know everything.	Mihi opus est omnia scire.
but now it will be for you.	sed nunc erit vobis.
Someone can do the work.	Aliquis opus facere potest.
This is very likely.	Verisimile hoc est.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
But soon he realized that he could not.	Sed mox intellexit se non posse.
I tried myself.	Conatus sum ipse.
But this is not at all.	Sed hoc omnino non est.
But certainly none.	Sed certe nulla.
It probably was.	Probabile esset.
Are you with us.	Esne nobiscum.
I didn't know what to think.	Nesciebam quid cogitare.
But he is also himself.	Sed et ipsum est.
He came even after us.	Venit usque post nos.
I hope you can't say that.	Spero non potes dicere.
That's just good.	Sic tantum bonum.
I don't mean to be.	Non vult esse.
He didn't think so.	Non putabat.
Something about him, something.	Aliquid de eo, aliquid.
Here for you.	Hic tibi.
Now you know it.	Nunc id scis.
It would seem that this is not the case.	Videtur quod hoc non sit amplius.
Yes you are right.	Etiam tu recte.
It was too early.	Nimis mane erat.
No that was none.	Nulla id nulla erat.
Don't swim alone!	Noli natare solus!
I can't stay here longer.	Hic diutius manere non possum.
It's not going to happen.	Non futurum est.
We truly are.	Vere nos.
He told me the guy's name.	Nomen mihi dixit guy.
I don't know what's good and what's not.	Nescio quid bonum et quid non est.
The boy can't.	Puer non potest.
You can't do it this way.	Hoc modo facere non potes.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
Why are you here?	Quid tu hic?
what i've seen.	quae ego vidi.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
Nothing says how it was done.	Nihil dixit quomodo factum est.
As it is not so, but as it is.	Ut non sic est, sed ut est.
I know, and you know.	Scio, et tu scis.
Nobody.	Nemo.
But it never does.	Sed id numquam enim est.
She never wanted me or her.	Nunquam me vel illa voluit.
I know us.	Scio nos.
It's his job.	Eius officium est.
There was nothing else in him.	Nihil aliud in eo erat.
There's no time in there.	Non nunc est in ibi.
Maybe it wasn't him.	Aliquam non erat ipsum.
In this way.	Eo modo.
There is some great fun.	Magna aliquam sit amet.
He came in the night.	Nocte venit.
But there was.	Sed erat.
He knew it would be time.	Id tempus fore sciebat.
This is the same little thing.	Hoc idem parum.
I don't like anything else.	Non placet aliud.
I want to talk about this.	De hoc volo dicere.
He likes to be himself.	Velit ut ipsum.
But it seems similar.	Sed videtur simile.
Only one afternoon together.	Tantum unum post meridiem una.
You think about her yes, don't you?	Etiam de illa cogitas, annon?
It is never too late to believe.	Numquam nimis sero est credere.
And another.	Et aliud.
I am not alone.	Non solum ego.
He was there.	Erat ibi.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
We just got it.	Nos iustus obtinuit eam.
I would like to tell you.	Te dicere vellem.
His father or	Pater eius an.
But not too long.	Sed nec nimium diu.
I can not.	Non possum.
We can all.	Omnes possumus.
The father did not say to him.	Non dixit ei pater.
That's what I was using.	Id erat quod per.
Well done.	Recte factum.
I can't help it.	Eum adiuvare non possum.
What's better for you and me.	Quid melius per me et te.
Yes, but not the same.	Etiam nec ipsum nisi.
To speak.	Loqui.
I need something new.	Aliquid novi opus est.
I could not have.	habere non potui.
Now he does it all.	Nunc omnes facit.
All of which	Quae omnia.
This is what he says.	Hic est quod dicit.
Or there was none.	Vel erat nulla.
I know it too.	Novi etiam.
Everything was for me.	Mihi omnia erat.
We don't have people.	Non habemus homines.
It is important to be great.	Aliquam sit amet magna.
No that was him.	Nulla id erat ei.
He was in a no.	In a nulla erat.
That's always it.	Ut id semper est.
Everything you need is great.	Omnia magna opus est.
Don't like to play.	Ludere non placet.
We're not over yet.	Non per adhuc sumus.
Maybe someone like him.	Aliquam quis ut ipsum.
They are almost exactly the same.	Fere prorsus idem sunt.
I'm glad that no one saw it.	Gaudeo quod nemo vidit.
This was too easy.	Nimis hoc facile fuit.
You can never be totally sure.	Prorsus certo numquam potes esse.
By the very time	Per ipsum tempus.
I could not tell you why.	Non potui tibi dicere quare.
He doesn't have a dog.	Canem non habet.
They are good.	Bona sunt.
May do with what is right.	Sit facere cum quod est.
I said nothing more.	nihil amplius dixi.
This is easy enough.	Hoc satis facile est.
He ate well.	Bene comedit.
Not so much here, though.	Non tam hic, sed.
Nor is he himself.	Nec ipse est.
never met him.	numquam ei occurrit.
But he likes it himself.	Sed id ipsum velit.
who did this?	quis hoc fecit?
We're not like this.	Hic non sumus simile.
He likes everything.	Velit erat.
This has happened a lot.	Hoc factum est multum.
But not great.	Sed non magna.
No but for him.	Nulla sed enim ipsum.
Always know where it is.	Semper scis ubi sit.
I just wonder.	Modo miror.
It would be a pleasure to help.	Felix esset auxilio.
Look to you now and see what has happened to you.	Vide modo tibi, et vide quid acciderit.
I am scared too.	Vix sum etiam.
I see there I see.	Video ibi video.
It was always his.	Eius semper fuit.
I don't know exactly what.	Nescio quid prorsus.
But it is not the same.	Sed non ipsum est.
I made this happen.	Hoc feci fieri.
What you have.	Quod habes.
I can't leave him there.	Eum ibi relinquere non possum.
At least you have a job.	Certe habes officium.
Is there anything to do.	Estne facere id.
I don't want you to think that.	Nolo te id putare.
Probably a lot.	Verisimiliter multum.
And he knows what.	Et scit quid.
He didn't know he would talk to him like this.	Nesciebat se sic loqui ei.
Today he told me why.	Hodie dixit mihi quare.
He knew for sure.	Sciebat certe.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
But that's what you can do.	Sed id quod potes.
He didn't do what he does.	Non faceret quod facit.
it is not too late.	non est nimis sero.
I don't want to see this happen.	Nolo hoc fieri videre.
But both were made.	Sed utrumque factum est.
Nothing was made and nothing but.	Nihil factum est et nihil nisi.
so much he said.	tantum dixit.
I have to find help.	Habeo auxilium invenire.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
Even not very loud.	Etiam nec ipsum magna.
The guy seems to want it.	Videtur amet ipsum velle.
But it won't be long here.	Sed non diu hic erit.
Say yes.	Sic dic.
i'm not fine.	Im 'non bene.
I wanted him out.	eum ex volui.
I love him, you know.	Ego illum amo, tu scis.
I have done this.	Hoc ego feci.
Tomorrow she's back again.	Cras illa iterum.
I would like to hear about everything.	De omnibus audire vellem.
where no one knew.	ubi nemo scivit.
Something bad has happened to you now.	Aliquid mali nunc acciderit.
I couldn't do much with it.	Non potui cum illa multa facere.
He can't be his.	Non potest esse eius.
had a question about her.	quaestionem habuit de suo.
You can't stay here!	Hic manere non potes!
She had dinner that night.	Illa nocte cenam habuit.
But now you know it.	Sed id nunc scis.
It was too much.	Nimium erat.
It is not for us.	Non est nobis.
Maybe it was a great time.	Aliquam erat tempus magna.
He does not know.	Nescit.
There was nothing that could be done.	Nihil erat quod fieri posset.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
i never knew one.	numquam scivi unum.
I can't stay.	Non possum manere.
You said you wanted to help me.	Tu ei dixisti me adiuvare velle.
which I could do many things.	quod multa facere potui.
So you tried.	Ita conatus.
But that's not much.	Sed id non multum.
It's not the same thing.	Etiam non ipsum ex.
and he went away.	et abiit.
I don't want to give anything.	Nolo aliquid dare.
This can't be just about you.	Hoc solum de te esse non potest.
But that's none of it.	Sed id nulla ipsum.
to you.	ad te.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
He told you about me.	Dixit tibi de me.
Which is true.	Quod est verum.
And what do you think.	Quid autem vobis videtur.
But he also makes one for himself.	Sibi quoque unum facit, sed.
You can do it with him only.	Facere potes cum eo tantum.
and you can see through him.	et videre potes per ipsum.
This is not working.	Hoc non opus est.
never been there.	numquam ibi.
This could not be done in this way.	Hoc modo fieri non potuit.
All to one.	Omnes ad unum.
It was a story from him.	Aliquam a ipsum erat.
That one thing.	Unum illud.
I have done really well.	Vere bene feci.
I couldn't stop anything.	Non potui aliquid prohibere.
This is very good.	Hoc valde bonum est.
He doesn't want to do it.	Non vult facere.
Great for us.	Magna, nobis.
You are a good guy.	Bonus es guy.
We have not here.	Non habemus hic.
That's pretty much the same thing.	Fere id ipsum.
Too much.	Nimium.
I need to get home.	Mihi opus est domum.
He refused to do so.	Noluit id.
I am not a man anymore.	Non sum homo amplius.
You don't have anything to give.	Non habes aliquid dare.
He had enough.	Satis habuit.
Which indeed is not true.	Quod quidem verum non est.
But he can see.	Sed videre potest.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
Maybe he's not there.	Fortasse non est ibi.
I have seen this.	hoc vidi.
Only early, early morning.	Modo mane, mane, mane.
The same would be true.	Idem hoc verum esset.
sorry for me.	paenitet me.
We have this.	Hoc habemus.
I can't leave here.	Hic relinquere non possum.
I will not do it again.	Non faciam iterum.
So it is.	Ita est.
He didn't want to do it.	Id facere noluisse.
He did so.	Ita fecit.
Please be late.	Sis nuper.
But he says nothing.	Sed nihil dicit.
I would just not.	Mox non vellem.
He is for you.	Ipse tibi.
He did not know how to act.	Nesciebat agere.
But this is no longer true.	Sed hoc amplius non est.
That was it.	Erat id.
Even more than that.	Etiam quam quam.
I know you've done something about it.	Scio te aliquid ex eo factum esse.
i can do anything else.	aliud facere possum.
He does well.	Bene facit.
I just want to go.	Ego iustus volo ire.
I will say nothing more.	nihil dicam amplius.
I'm not used to doing this.	Im 'non hoc facere solebat.
Where has he gone? 	Quo abiit?
I think you still have it.	Puto adhuc habere eam.
Time.	Eo tempore.
Maybe that's a great idea.	Aliquam id dictum magna.
I want your help.	Auxilium tuum volo.
But I don't get any of it.	Sed nec aliquam ex.
It's late now.	Sero modo.
It is much better.	Multo melius est.
But that's from ex.	Sed id ex ex.
And i'm sorry.	Et ego paenitet.
It is necessary to do something.	Necesse est aliquid.
Or perhaps it is not good.	Vel fortasse non est bonum.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
But it is not the same.	Sed non ipsum est.
You'll never get him.	Numquam ut eum.
A righteous man does not.	Vir iustus non vult.
You are.	Es.
Do you have anything you want to talk about?	Habesne quid vis loqui?
You might not be surprised.	Fortasse non miror.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
I don't want to see him ever again.	Nolo illum semper iterum videre.
You'd better do the same.	Melius tu idem velis.
I can't do anything else.	Non possum aliud facere.
I am astonished indeed.	Miror quidem.
I was lucky.	felix fui.
I don't think you even want help.	Non puto te vel auxilium velle.
The situation is fine.	Bene se res habet.
No one knows.	Nemo scit.
Yes they are all.	Ita omnes.
However, it was not easy.	Tamen non facile erat.
It was not bad.	Malum non erat.
It was a great thing to see.	Magna res erat videre.
I can't help it.	Eum adiuvare non possum.
Which I did so.	Quod ita feci.
And you are.	Et tu es.
I don't really like it.	Non vere amo eam.
Never stop trying.	Numquam prohibere conatur.
I wanted, you know.	Volui, scis.
I certainly want to play.	Certe ludere volo.
We have where and how, right now we need it.	Habemus ubi et quomodo, nunc opus est.
There was nothing to do.	Fuisse nihil faciendum.
Take a look here.	Vide hic.
He knew how to look.	Sciebat vide.
No one can truly speak.	Nemo potest vere dicere.
busy, busy, busy today.	occupatus, occupatus, occupatus est hodie.
I hope you can live with us.	Spero te posse nobiscum vivere.
But it was time for him.	Sed tempus erat ipsum.
yes we need you.	Etiam nobis opus est te.
I wanted to be one.	unum esse volui.
But this is not going to happen.	Sed hoc non est futurum.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
All mine are with me.	Omnia mea mecum sunt.
But it's easy enough.	Sed satis facile est.
You need to do the job for me.	Pro me officium debes facere.
not.	Nonne.
She could really play.	Posset vere ludere.
This is from me.	Hoc a me est.
That's what it is.	Id ipsum quid.
That's where I need it.	Id ubi opus est.
No one else can do the job.	Nemo aliud potest facere officium.
I did something for you and you know what it is.	Aliquid pro te feci, et tu scis quid sit.
I want you to do many things.	Volo ut multa facias.
That's the job.	Id officium.
It is never a bad thing to say anything.	Numquam malum est dicere de aliquo.
It is, and it is not.	Est, et est non.
There was nothing here to do.	Nihil erat hic facere.
Now tell me.	Nunc dic mihi.
and never forgot.	et numquam oblitus est.
Well indeed not.	Bene quidem non.
I don't want to talk much with him.	Non multum volo cum eo loqui.
And he came.	Et venit.
It was his job.	Esset eius officium.
Maybe later, not tonight, but tomorrow.	Fortasse post, non hac nocte, sed cras.
This man ought not to be certain, in doing this.	Hic certus non debet esse, hoc faciens.
there is no question.	nulla quaestio est.
It's probably in the afternoon.	Post meridiem, verisimile est.
I like living well.	Placet tibi bene vivere.
So we are as far as we can.	Sic sumus, quantum possumus.
What you have, but you do not have.	Quod habes, sed non habes.
That's not going to be bad.	Non id malum eat.
One day he came to me.	Una die venit ad me.
No one said how important it is.	Nulla sit amet dictum quam.
never see you again.	Non te videre iterum.
Even before it was not.	Etiam non ante erat.
I thought yes.	Cogitavi etiam.
I have friends with money.	Pecuniam amicos habeo.
He was a teacher.	Magister erat.
as i are.	sicut ego es.
Also always great.	Etiam semper magna.
And it was done.	Et factum est.
It is probable.	Probabile est.
And his work.	Opus autem eius.
I need both.	utrumque mihi opus est.
I don't know how it's happened.	Nescio quomodo acciderit.
I don't know what to say to you.	Quid tibi dicam nescio.
all at once.	Omnes simul.
You have a plan.	Habes consilium.
I don't like this at all.	Hoc omnino non placet.
No one knows where you are.	Nemo scit ubi sis.
Without them she wants to leave.	Sine illa relinquere non vult.
I knew it was going to be.	sciebam futurum esse.
To be honest.	Ut sit amet.
I was there.	ibi fui.
It's going to be good.	Illud futurum esse bonum.
As it was.	Ut erat.
Yes, that's a great idea.	Etiam id dictum magna.
Or before.	Vel ante.
He certainly is.	Ipse certe.
He was not good either.	Non erat bonus, vel.
I don't like it.	Non amo id.
I really wanted.	Ego vere volui.
That is.	Id est.
It is bad.	Malum est.
Probably just how you're getting on.	Probabiliter iustus quomodo questus es.
I'm afraid of what's behind.	Vereor ne quid post.
I hope not too much.	Spero non nimis.
but if it is necessary to go.	sed si ire necesse est.
There seemed to be little need for this.	Tam parum ad hoc opus esse videbatur.
I had to leave my job.	Habui officium meum relinquere.
Maybe always before anyone.	Aliquam semper ante quis.
The same again.	Ipse iterum.
But we also.	Sed et nos.
Or what I always thought.	Vel id quod semper putabat.
He has to stop.	Habet prohibere.
It will last much longer.	Multo diutius sic erit.
He cannot have both.	Utrumque habere non potest.
It is not enough, but it is.	Non satis est, hoc tamen est.
I can't stop you from saying that.	Non possum te prohibere, quae dixit.
He was with them.	Erat cum.
That was the time.	Id erat tempus.
He did not see.	Non vidit.
He has his own plan.	Habet suum consilium.
I never asked how it was.	Numquam quaesivit quomodo esset.
Let's say something.	Sit aliquid.
Definitely to win.	Certus est vincere.
I wish it were me.	Utinam esset me.
So it is.	Ita est.
That's his name.	Id eius nomen.
It was only this morning.	Hoc solum erat mane.
He did so.	Ita fecit.
That was one thing.	Unum id erat.
But we're here for a while.	Sed hic ad tempus sumus.
Yes, but that's how.	Etiam id nisi quam.
But nothing else.	Sed nihil aliud.
No one saw him.	Nemo eum vidit.
So do us as it is.	Sic fac nos sicut est.
Now is the time before.	Nunc ante tempus est.
I don't need to know.	Non opus est scire.
Well, that's me.	Bene, id me.
I don't care who it is or who does it.	Nolo quis sit vel quis fecerit.
There is no need to say.	Nihil opus est dicere.
I have nothing to do.	Non habeo facere.
But don't get me wrong with you.	Sed non male tecum.
I've never heard anything like that.	Nunquam quicquam simile audivi.
Maybe you don't need it here.	Forsitan non hic opus est.
This is good.	Hoc bonum est.
Now he wanted him again.	Iam iterum eum voluit.
I think it's always going to happen.	Semper futurum puto.
She just did it to me tonight.	Illa mea nocte sicut fecit.
We are here.	Hic sumus.
Nothing, however, was.	Nihil tamen erat.
He's come here now.	Hic nunc huc venit.
We will not talk again.	Nos non loqui iterum.
Don't say anything else.	Ne quid aliud dicam.
This was true.	Hoc verum erat.
It was said what that is.	Dictum quid sit illud.
This was what you said.	Hoc erat quod dixisti.
And that's nothing to me.	Et quod nihil ad me.
It was done.	Factum.
Well, started getting better.	Bene, melius questus incepit.
But from none to none.	Sed a nulla nulla.
I think I should be.	Puto me esse.
Please take a look.	Vide sis.
You are late.	Sero es.
And to know why.	Et scire quare.
Which one is not true.	Quod unum non est verum.
They are not yours.	Quae tua non sunt.
I've always wanted to go.	Ego semper ire volui.
For he is not one.	Non enim unum est.
You have done well there.	Bene fecisti ibi.
After all, he knows that all things seem good to him.	Post omnia, scit omnia sibi bona videri.
They are always there.	Semper sunt.
But it is good.	Sed bonum est.
I can't hear you.	Te audire non possum.
But that was the time.	Sed id tempus erat.
It's not what it used to be right now.	Iam non est quod esse solebat.
Which is not true.	Quod non est verum.
The man knew nothing.	Vir nihil scivit.
She looks nothing.	Illa nihil spectat.
Even from which.	Etiam a quam quam.
I can have someone very good looking.	Ego valde bene aliquem habere potest vultus.
We can do all these things.	Haec omnia possumus.
We really like it.	Vere placet nobis.
I hope you like it!	Spero tibi placet!.
Which is always true.	Quae semper.
still with him.	Cum eo adhuc.
These are mine.	Illa mea sunt.
Now we're here.	Nunc hic sumus.
Now I don't have any money.	Nunc aliquam pecuniam non habeo.
I know nothing about him.	nihil de eo scio.
Yes, but it was said out loud.	Etiam sed dictum magna.
You know what?	Tu quid?.
He refused to believe.	Noluit credere.
You need what you want.	Opus est tibi quod vis.
never before at all.	id numquam ante omnia.
It won't be too hard.	Non erit difficile.
Except for that.	Nisi quam.
You mean well.	Vis bene.
I knew nothing.	Nihil sciebam.
I am talking about it.	De id mihi.
I've never seen it before.	Numquam ante eam vidi.
And it is true.	Et verum est.
All in all, I feel it.	Omnino sentio.
It's getting better.	Suus 'melius questus.
All the time.	Omnia temporis.
Never do that yourself.	Numquam id ipsum.
I need this today.	Hoc hodie mihi opus est.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
And let it be.	Sit et.
That's how you want to play.	Id quam vis ludere.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
I need to help you.	Opus est ut auxilio es.
No, not again.	Non, non iterum.
I don't know which one.	Nescio quod unum.
I'm glad for you.	Gaudeo tibi.
He told him that he could not stay.	Dixit ei se non posse manere.
All you need to do is please.	Omnes opus est facere ut velit.
He doesn't want either.	Vel velit non.
I see you even today.	Video etiam hodie.
He says.	Dicit.
It's already late at night.	Iam multa nocte est.
No one knows where he is.	Nemo scit ubi sit.
But this was not.	Sed hoc non erat.
Well, room.	Bene, cubiculum.
Now who's out.	Nunc quis ex.
You're on time.	Tu in tempore es.
that he did not expect it.	id se non putabat.
I think this will help her a lot.	Puto hanc multum adiuvare eam.
What things	Quae res.
She seemed to complain to him.	Questus sibi videbatur illa.
But he was not here.	Sed hic non erat.
He is very happy for you.	Sit amet ipsum enim.
You should always say the truth.	Semper verum dicere debes.
i only help you.	ego tantum tibi.
I have something like you.	Habeo tibi aliquid simile.
It's pretty good.	Satis est bonum.
I won't be your problem.	Non erit tibi quaestio.
as much as i can say.	quod multa possum dicere.
Thought you did something for him.	Putavit te aliquid per illum.
It was not like this.	Hoc non erat simile.
No one at all.	Prorsus nemo.
It's not too hard.	Non nimis difficile est.
I have him now.	Nunc eum habeo.
I can't say enough good things.	Non possum satis bona dicere.
It's time to talk to him.	Est tempus ipsum loqui.
All you need to do, whether or not with someone else.	Omnes facere debes, necne cum aliquo.
But no more.	Sed non amplius.
the work was done.	opus fuit.
Can't do it in.	Non potest facere in.
I feel really good.	Sentio vere bonum.
It is.	Est.
Don't let anyone see this.	Ne quis hoc video.
You are going to do this now.	Hoc nunc facturus es.
Look for you.	Vide tibi.
If not you.	Nisi tu.
But no one wants.	Sed quis nulla velit.
This he loves.	Hoc amat.
It's time to take some time.	Aliquam ut aliquam nunc.
That was great.	Ut id magna erat.
now i'm very pleased.	nunc admodum sum.
I heard a lot now.	Multum modo audivi.
What could be more?	Quid potuit amplius esse?
Which never happened.	Quae numquam.
he said.	dixit.
All the same, after all.	Omnes idem, post.
he makes us.	nos facit.
Wish there was something.	Vis erat aliquid.
It is very important to say.	Aliquam sit amet dictum ipsum.
But the same day she told me again.	Sed idem hodie iterum indicavit mihi.
But you cannot come with us.	Sed nobiscum venire non potes.
Look soon.	Vide mox.
You're in the night.	Sis in nocte.
He wills what he cannot have.	Vult quod habere non potest.
and he could not.	et potuit.
I hope to see you soon.	Spero videre te mox.
Yes not this.	Ita non hoc.
I have not seen this.	Hoc non vidi.
but it was yesterday.	sed heri erat.
I was sure.	Certus eram.
To come or go later.	Venire vel ire post.
That's never going to happen.	Id numquam facturus.
The future is now done.	Futurum nunc factum est.
Well done job.	Bene factum est officium.
Tonight, now again.	Hac nocte, nunc iterum.
Yes but very nice.	Etiam sed ipsum nisi.
Is it correct?	An recte?.
Now it is not true.	Verum iam non est.
To some but none at all.	Ut sed aliquam nulla.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id erat ipsum.
I was ready.	paratus eram.
And from me.	Et a me.
I just told him that.	Modo ei ut.
Is that out.	Estne ut ex.
Really great.	Vere magna.
Which was said a little before.	Quod paulo ante dictum est.
Everything is yes or no.	Omnia est necne.
Not sure if ever.	Non certe, si semper.
Tell her we want to talk to her.	Dic ei nos velle loqui ei.
You don't want to do this.	Hoc facere non vis.
But it is so difficult.	Sed tam difficile est.
This is enough.	Hoc satis est.
Nothing can stop me!	Nihil me prohibere potest!
He understood now.	Intellexit nunc.
This means here.	Hoc modo hic.
What time does he leave home?	Quod tempus non reliquit domum suam?
I am getting great now.	Nunc magna questus sum.
Yes, yes.	Ita est, ita .
Maybe not before.	Aliquam non ante enim.
He came here.	Hic venit.
Maybe you can think of something?.	Fortasse cogitare aliquid potes ?.
We can leave you with it.	Te relinquere possumus ad eam.
Please take a look	Vide quaeso .
Better without.	Melius sine.
He said with certainty.	Certo dixit.
He wants you to live one day at a time.	Te unum diem ad tempus vivere vult.
You can play.	Ludere potes.
He said nothing.	Nihil dixit.
The force is great.	Vis magna est.
It's time to say what it was.	Aliquam dictum quam erat.
Not both.	Non ambo.
I could not do as I did.	facere non potui sicut fecit.
That's a lot of bad!	Multum id malum!
I!	Sum ego!
Got help.	Obtinuit auxilium.
And that's enough to say.	Et id satis dicere.
Yes, he is here.	Etiam hic est.
Can't do any good job.	Non potest bene facere aliquem officium.
I have seen everything.	Vidi omnia.
Maybe it was necessary.	Fortasse opus esset.
You don't have so much to come before you.	Non habes tam ante te futurum.
It seems likely this season, though.	Hoc tempore verisimile non videtur, sed.
but he thinks it was not.	sed putat non fuisse.
The more you do, the better you have.	Quod plus facis, eo melius habes.
And he's still with me.	Et adhuc mecum est.
I've never heard this advice before.	Nunquam ante hoc consilium audivi.
So he can't go.	Sic ire non potest.
It is time to have a great time.	Aliquam sit amet tempus magna.
You mean all to him.	Vos omnes sibi vult.
That time is gone.	Quod tempus abiit.
did it, you know.	fecerit, scis.
I'm not sure exactly how to do it.	Non certus sum prorsus quomodo id faciam.
if possible.	si fieri potest.
But there was none.	Sed non nulla erat.
Nothing to see here.	Nihil hic videre.
you said my name.	dixisti nomen meum.
I could not think.	Cogitare non potui.
Look what you are doing.	Vide quid facias.
At no time was that.	In tempus non erat ut.
I'm talking about	de Im.
He is the same.	Ipse est.
What is to be done.	Quid sit quod faciendum est.
He likes to do so.	Velit id.
Wishing you better.	Melius est tibi velle.
I'd like advice.	Libet consilium.
Just want to do well.	Iustus volo ut bene facias.
Is good.	Bonus est.
we can leave.	relinquere possumus.
It could not have been better.	Non potuit melius.
I don't travel.	Non iter.
This can be done better.	Hoc melius fieri potest.
He said nothing, but.	Nihil dixit, sed.
You know these things for sure.	Haec certe scis.
It looks like.	Simile videtur.
Its essentially	Eius per se.
They are not.	Non sunt.
It could be done.	Fieri potuit.
No one said much.	Nemo multa dixit.
I'm sorry to say, but it's true.	Dicere me paenitet, sed verum est.
It is a great thing.	Res magna est.
you have too.	habes etiam.
It will be good for you.	Non erit tibi bonum.
I knew that was my best to do.	Sciebam, quod meum erat facere.
So it's too easy.	Sic nimium facile est.
We have that and that.	Id habemus et id .
But it was not the same.	Sed non ipsum erat.
It's just not going to happen.	Suus 'tantum non futurum est.
But before him.	Sed id ipsum ante.
I just do one.	Ego iustus faciam unum.
Please don't tell me.	Placet me nescire.
Both are good.	Utrumque bonum.
If now with not?	Si nunc cum non?.
This is the only one.	Hoc est solum unum.
That is today.	Quod hodie est.
No one can hear us here.	Nemo nos hic audire potest.
I am astonished at you.	Miror apud te.
Yes they are.	Ita sunt.
I just didn't go.	Modo non ire.
Looks better to me too.	Me quoque melius spectat.
Not true, but.	Non verum, sed.
If there was one.	Fuit si.
That's exactly the thing.	Ita prorsus rem.
And never do it.	Et id numquam.
I know for sure.	Pro certo scio.
Maybe it was one day.	Fortasse dies unus esset.
Everything should be in its own way.	Omnia debet esse suo modo.
That is a little more than nothing.	Quod paulo plus quam nihil est.
I don't know whether we can win.	Nescio an vincere possumus.
And this you can do nothing.	Et hoc nihil potes.
left me today.	Hodie me reliquit.
You do what you want.	Facis quod vis.
You are not there.	Non ibi.
Nothing about him, I'm sorry.	Nihil de illo, me paenitet.
I am indeed up to.	Ego quidem ad.
You have an affair.	Habes rem.
My real name.	Meum verum nomen.
sorry for all that thought.	Paenitet me omnes, quae putavit.
And you also know.	Et tu quoque scis.
To me it is nothing.	Mihi nihil est.
Maybe you haven't said that.	Aliquam non dictum quam.
It's late now.	Sero modo.
Well done.	Bene factum.
There was none.	Nulla erat.
I am not going to do so.	Non sum facturus sic.
You don't need this to happen.	Non opus est tibi hoc fieri.
He did not know why.	Nesciebat cur.
You can see him there.	Ibi eum videre potes.
Too good indeed.	Nimis bene quidem.
This is not possible.	Quod quidem fieri non potest.
We can't do this now.	Hoc non modo fieri non possumus.
I think it's okay.	Ego sic bene est.
How is this possible?	Quomodo hoc fieri potest?
This is your job.	Hoc officium tuum est.
I don't know exactly how to tell you this.	Hoc prorsus nescio quomodo tibi dicam.
But counsel is not counsel.	Sed non est consilium consilium.
It was a great time.	Magna dictum tempus.
You just exist.	Vos iustus est.
He didn't want to do that, yet.	Quod facere nolebat, nondum.
He did not know.	Nesciebat.
That's gonna be great.	Ut sit amet magna.
It is to do so.	Est id.
You.	Vos.
I knew you were going to be me.	Sciebam te a me futurum esse.
It was a great time.	Dictum tempus magna.
It is good to be good.	Bonum est esse bonum.
I know my nationality.	Scio genus meum.
Something happened and she left the room.	Aliquid factum est et cubiculum reliquit.
He knows me too well.	Me nimium bene novit.
It's not always like this.	Non semper sic.
Maybe you haven't said it before.	Aliquam dictum non ante.
Don't do this for me.	Noli hoc de me facere.
That will be soon.	Quod mox erit.
The question is: you need to know how to do it.	Quaestio est: debes scire quomodo facias.
He eats an apple.	Malum comedit.
Certainly not tonight.	Certe hac nocte non est.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
Yes but no.	Etiam sed dictum nulla.
He could even win.	Potuit etiam vincere.
You love yourself better than anyone you know.	Te ipsum melius quam quis scis.
Not really, but it seemed so.	Non vere, sed sic videbatur.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Noluit mecum loqui.
I just can't talk.	Modo non possum dicere.
This attempt did not succeed.	Haec conatus non obtinuit.
You can leave us now.	Nunc nobis relinquere potes.
I hope you're coming to me soon.	Spero te mox ad me venire.
You know it's true.	Scis verum esse.
It was good to be true.	Bonum erat esse verum.
This man was.	Hic vir erat.
One question, however.	Una quaestio, sed.
it was not much, but it was something.	non multum erat, sed aliquid erat.
I'm not at my best at the moment.	Non sum apud me optime in tempore.
Well done.	Bene factum.
never told him.	numquam ei.
It is never good for me.	Numquam mihi bonum est.
So he can't go.	Sic ire non potest.
He also was not himself.	Etiam non ipsum erat.
I'm in right now.	Me in nunc.
I barely knew what to do.	Vix sciebam quid facerem.
what about him?	quid de eo?
There, so	Ibi, sic.
Except for the night.	Nisi nocte.
And this only for me.	Et hoc tantum mihi.
Nothing is going to happen.	Nihil futurum est.
No one even knew he was there.	Nemo etiam sciebat ibi esse.
To be honest for you.	Ut sit amet enim.
That's some very good thing.	Ut id aliquam ipsum.
Please stay where you are.	Quaeso mane ubi es.
He could even swim better.	Potuit etiam melius natare.
I am so prepared.	Tam paratus sum.
He was not in school today.	Hodie in schola non erat.
To be honest for nothing.	Ut sit amet enim nisi.
Say what you want.	Dic quod vis.
Has this been done before?	Hoc ante factum est?
And now here.	Et nunc hic.
To be honest.	Ut sit amet.
I didn't want to be here.	Hic esse nolui.
You have done good.	Bonum fecisti.
i want to be well.	volo bene esse.
Look at yourself alone.	Vide te ipsum solum.
No one wants him!	Nemo velit ipsum!.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
I hope that's not for you.	Spero quod non est tibi.
It is.	Est.
You'd better leave now.	Nunc relinquere melius velis.
No one knew.	Nemo sciebat.
He can do it if he wants.	Potest si velit.
It was bad as well.	Malum fuit, ut bene.
I don't know, not really.	Nescio, non vere.
I know for sure who it is.	Pro certo scio quis sit.
I like this song?	Placet hoc?
Well done.	Bene factum est.
which I do very well.	quod valde bene facio.
Often that's great.	Saepe id magna.
Don't do anything.	Ne quid facias.
Certainly we cannot understand.	Certe intelligere non possumus.
He knew he could not win.	Sciebat se vincere non posse.
Maybe he knew it.	Fortasse sciebat.
I have never been.	numquam fui.
Only never enough.	Tantum numquam satis.
I'm not sure how much.	Non sum certus quantum.
I believe it to be.	Credo ita esse.
Do as long as you can.	Fac modo quod potes.
and could see nothing.	& nihil videre potuit.
But either way.	Sed vel ita.
I tried too.	Conatus sum etiam.
I truly believe this to be true.	Vere credo hoc verum esse.
That's like here.	Id est ut hic.
I don't want this.	Nolo hoc.
If you know, please help.	Si scis, auxilium placet.
and he knows us.	et novit nos.
And do you again.	Et tu iterum fac.
I'm glad I'm home.	Gaudeo me domi esse.
No, not at all.	Non, omnino non.
He was in school.	In schola erat.
We will talk to you shortly after.	Nos paulo post loqui tecum.
He could not stay here.	Hic manere non potuit.
It was his job.	Eius officium erat.
That's up to you.	Id ad vos.
He wasn't sure how to do it.	Non certus erat quomodo id faceret.
But now it's getting on.	Sed iam questus est.
I need it.	Eo opus est.
You can be my mom.	Potes meum, meum.
He doesn't have to give up anymore.	Non habet amplius dare.
This has been done.	Hoc factum est.
We have .	Habemus .
Even more important than that.	Etiam vel magna quam.
In other words, they are not men.	Id est, homines non sunt.
What he wanted and why.	Quid vellet, et quare.
Not even here.	Ne hic quidem.
I was not here but for him.	Hic non essem nisi pro eo.
I have seen this.	hoc vidi.
It has to be done.	Fieri sic habet.
None before.	Nulla ante.
Nothing goes here.	Hic nihil eat.
No one did it.	Nemo id fecit.
It was still early.	Mane adhuc erat.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
It was not hard enough.	Non satis difficile erat.
I was ready.	paratus eram.
I thought about you a lot.	Cogitavi te multum.
He is doing well now.	Bene nunc agit.
He has nothing there.	Nihil ibi habet.
in and out of email.	In et ex quis.
At length he understood.	Tandem intellexit.
They're there for me.	Sunt ibi me.
He is no longer a boy, but is not yet a man.	Non iam puer est, sed nondum est homo.
But no one.	Sed quis nulla.
Better late than never this is my work.	Melius sero quam numquam hoc meum opus est.
Has a job.	Habet officium.
We can do something.	Aliquid facere possumus.
No one yet comes.	Nemo tamen venit.
I'm afraid of it.	Vereor eam.
Don't do everything.	Omnia ne feceris.
Nothing seemed to be able to do.	Nihil videbatur facere posse.
It's better for you than work after dinner.	Melius quidem tibi est quam post cenam opus.
But you already know.	Sed iam scis.
But not before.	Sed nec ante.
To really be better.	Ut vere melius.
But you're not really here.	Sed non vere hic es.
It's not so hard.	Non ita sit difficile.
From in .	Ab in .
perhaps they are.	fortasse sunt.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
You can do this as much.	Hoc ut potes.
It was one thing to work with.	Ad unum opus erat.
I know this to be true.	Scio hoc verum esse.
But he has all things.	Sed omnia habet.
He never wants to do so.	Velit numquam id.
It will always be.	Semper erit.
But he did not tell what had happened.    	Sed quid acciderit, non indicavit.    
It's my name.	Est mihi nomen.
He already knows.	Scit jam.
I rejoice in what I said.	Gaudeo quod dixi.
Perhaps for dinner.	Ad cenam fortasse.
This is almost the only way to do it.	Hoc fere modo facere.
There is no need to say anything else.	Non necesse est aliud dicere.
It was not the first time.	Non primum factum est.
It is not certain.	Certum non est.
It is necessary to speak.	Loqui necesse est.
I have said this.	Hoc dixi.
No time no.	Nulla id tempus nulla.
Because I know how to do it.	Scivi facere.
if anyone can do this.	si quis hoc facere potest.
But it seems likely.	Sed verisimile videtur.
As it was from him which he refused.	Sicut erat ab eo quod noluit.
I want you to stay here.	Volo te hic manere.
he knows a lot.	multum novit.
That's a guy with no future.	Id est a guy cum non futurum.
He is not here.	Non est hic.
Good, but not the same.	Bonum, sed idem.
This was all for me.	Hic mihi erat omnia.
Almost everyone does.	Fere omnes facit.
This could have been too much for me, my father did.	Nimium id potuit mihi, pater fecit.
I believe him.	ei credo.
But it is.	Sed est.
All these things he does great.	Haec omnia magna facit.
I made money.	Pecuniam feci.
I can't be alone.	Non possum solus.
But she was not home.	Illa tamen non erat in domum suam.
We'll stay here now.	Te modo hic nos manere.
It was not like either.	Vel non erat similis.
And my father never knew.	Et pater numquam scivit.
It's something to do or to do.	Est aliquid facere vel facere.
It does not please.	Non placet.
Don't you like it?	Nonne placet?
I believe in him.	Credo in eum.
This has begun.	Hoc incepit.
Better to be with you here and now.	Melius est ut cum hic et nunc.
Hardly so.	Ita vix.
I know what you like.	Scio quid simile.
Not at this time yet.	Non tamen hoc tempore.
He refused to believe.	Noluit credere.
Certainly, I would do this now.	Certe, hoc nunc facerem.
It's a good plan.	Bonum consilium est.
It is certain.	Certum est.
I want to stop this.	Hoc volo prohibere.
I can't make breakfast at home.	Prandium domi facere non possum.
Well done.	Bene fuit.
I guess they can do it.	Suspicor id facere posse.
I've been busy.	Fui occupatus.
I could not have done it again.	Iterum fieri non potui.
I haven't seen it before.	Non vidit ante.
He wants to see me.	Me vult videre.
They are still.	Sunt tamen.
But there was no time.	Sed nec tempus erat.
I was just happy to be with him.	Sicut fui cum eo felix esse.
It would seem that it is not.	Videtur quod non.
all but three.	omnes, sed tres.
I would like to think of one tomorrow.	Cras unum cogitare vellem.
He didn't want to know.	Noluit scio.
Afterward he does something else.	Post haec aliquid aliud facit.
I haven't heard yet.	Non audivi adhuc.
But it can still be done.	Fieri tamen adhuc potest.
We both need it.	Nobis utrumque opus est.
I was very lucky to meet you.	Felix valde occurrit.
I will do well.	Bene faciam.
never be her.	numquam esse eam.
And say again.	Et dic iterum.
to receive.	ACCIPERE.
You will need to stay together.	Simul manere necesse erit.
I hope it still does.	Spero tamen id facit.
But you can do the thing here.	Sed rem hic facere potes.
For they are.	Sunt enim.
That's not how it was.	Ut non erat quam.
Something must be behind.	Aliquid post esse debet.
You always did well.	Semper tibi bene fecit.
Yes, but it was great.	Etiam sed erat magna.
I don't have anything else to know.	Non habeo aliud scire.
But he has not forgotten.	Sed non oblitus est.
and you're in.	et tu in.
But this is not so.	Sed hoc non est ita.
He could not do this himself.	Se hoc facere potuit.
I never wanted to see her.	Numquam voluit ad eam.
You are here.	Hic es.
He was no longer a man.	Iam non erat homo.
Stay here early every morning.	Hic mane mane omnes mane.
We're there for dinner.	Ibi ad cenam sumus.
There is still work to be done.	Est opus adhuc faciendum.
And you can have it.	Et habere potes.
if you want to know.	si scire vis.
It's got a good job.	Suus 'bonum officium obtinuit.
That time.	Tempus illud.
I know my job.	Scio officium meum.
All you need is to go there.	Omnes opus est ire illuc.
I hope that you find what you like.	Spero quod habes quod tibi placet.
So it is.	Ita est.
That's the thing.	Id rem.
Nothing else.	Nihil aliud.
But none of them is right.	Nemo tamen de omnibus recte est.
That's a good question.	Quod bonum est quaestio.
Truly a good man, a good man.	Vere bonus, bonus, homo videtur.
And it will not be.	Et non erit.
I don't need to think long.	Non opus est diu cogitare.
He did not wish.	Nec velit.
You don't do it for me.	Non facis mihi.
I indeed did.	Ego quidem feci.
Make a day out of it.	Diem ex eo fac.
There was no day.	Ibi fuit die illo.
I think it would take a long time.	Puto diu fore.
That day is not here.	Non est hic dies ille.
To be indebted	Debere.
It is certain that you understand.	Certum est te intelligere.
I know what you mean.	Scio quid velit.
I think it would be fun.	Puto fore ut amet.
Now she was no longer a child.	Iam iam non erat puer.
You know, you're for us.	Scis, pro nobis es.
It was a lot, perhaps too much.	Multum erat, fortasse nimis.
What to do?	Quid facere?
I see nothing wrong.	Nihil mali video.
Maybe even his father.	Fortasse etiam pater eius.
And do not do this any more.	Et ne hoc amplius facias.
In front of him.	In id ipsum ante.
He cannot be himself.	Non potest esse ipsum.
There was no facial expressions.	Vultus non erat.
It seemed much longer.	Multo diutius videbatur.
It is good, but not good.	Bonum est, sed non bonum.
It's fine for me.	Bene mihi est.
He could not.	Non potuit.
And now.	Et iam.
It was great.	Erat magna.
You've got to post it.	Te obtinuit ut post eam.
We cannot stay here.	Hic manere non possumus.
not you.	Non te.
But yes, he said.	Etiam sed dictum quam.
never married.	numquam uxorem.
not time out.	ne tempus e.
All right, he's right.	Recte ille recte.
I don't go to school.	Non ad scholam.
To get there.	Ut ibi.
I said this.	id dixi.
Nothing to him.	Nihil ad eum.
It's still there.	Est adhuc ibi.
I'm happy you are here today.	Sum felix hodie hic es.
Yes that's before.	Etiam id quam ante.
I would not go.	ire nolui.
That's not true.	Ut 'non est verum.
I thought about it a lot.	Cogitavi de hoc multum.
Don't say don't do it.	Noli dicere non facere.
This could not have been done.	Quod fieri non potuit.
I feel it now.	Sentio nunc.
The last year was nothing.	Proximo anno nihil erat.
And that's the same thing.	Et id ipsum.
But that's always nice.	Sed id semper nisi.
Nothing else could he do.	Nihil aliud facere potuit.
Soon he comes to her.	Mox ad eam venit.
If he does.	Si agit.
I can't go on like this.	Non possum sic ire.
I don't have time for this now.	Non tempus hoc nunc.
I did not speak badly.	Non male dixi.
Don't buy.	Non emere.
They are not for him.	Non sunt pro eo.
They are the same.	Idem sunt.
That's very important.	Ut in ipsum magna.
This is probably what you want.	Hoc verisimile est quod vis.
But why .	Cur tamen .
I don't know what a guy like me saw.	Nescio quid in guy sicut me vidit.
No one knew enough.	Nemo satis scivit.
I have been.	Fui.
But don't leave alone again.	Sed non solum adhuc relinquere.
And a little	Et paulo .
It truly is to win, to win.	Hoc vere est vincere, vincere.
Maybe not some but	Aliquam non aliquam nisi.
I like this song.	Placet hoc.
I'm never going to do it.	Im 'nunquam facturus est.
I will do it again.	Iterum ego faciam.
You can talk to me.	Potes me loqui.
There is one thing to do.	Unum est facere.
It won't be hard to find it.	Non sit difficile invenire eum.
But not even that is enough.	Sed ne hoc quidem satis.
He wanted her to have everything.	Voluit eam habere omnia.
I don't think you said enough to me.	Non puto te mihi satis omnia dixisse.
Without me	Sine me.
All is well now.	Omnia iam bene.
He wanted to go home.	Domum ire voluit.
I was there at the time.	Ibi tempore fui.
That can never be enough.	Quod satis esse numquam potest.
Good time, too.	Bonum tempus, etiam.
Not with me, per se.	Mecum non, per se.
Everyone loves this.	Omnes hoc amat.
But early tonight.	Sed mane hac nocte.
never went away again.	numquam iterum abiit.
Et in et in et in et in.	Et in et in et in et in.
Don't you want him to stay?	Nonne eum vis manere?
You want to believe in yourself.	Vis ut in ipsum.
I hope bad.	Spero malum.
I had not.	non habui.
That's who it is.	Id quis est.
I have so much to tell you.	Habeo tantum tibi dicere.
He still loves you.	Adhuc amat te.
There was something else about him.	Aliud erat de eo.
I haven't said it for a while.	Non dictum est ad tempus.
They are not who we are.	Non sunt qui sumus.
But yet it was as soon as possible.	Sed sed erat ut quam.
What if there was no tomorrow?	Quid, si cras non fuit?
You said.	Dixisti.
help is possible.	Auxilium fieri potest.
No one can say what is to be done.	Nemo potest dicere quid faciendum sit.
Or that's the plan.	Vel id consilium.
There is.	Ibi est.
I don't mean to say great things.	Non vult dicere magna.
I just don't see it happening.	Modo non video fieri.
No one wants to be in it.	Nulla in ipsum velit.
Even before it was not.	Etiam non ante erat.
He was well out of it.	Erat bene ex.
And always for the better.	Et semper in melius.
It's bad for you.	Malum est tibi.
So you want to do well with me.	Sic facere vis, bene mecum.
Maybe that was not the case.	Aliquam id nisi erat.
What you don't need.	Quod non debes.
He knows me.	Scit me.
I was lucky.	felix fui.
Well, you're too late.	Bene, nimium sero es.
Tell yourself that it is not so.	Dic tibi quod non est ita.
But there was none.	Sed non nulla erat.
She goes, as always, to me.	Venit, ut semper, ad me.
It does not please.	Non placet.
You want to come here.	Huc vis venire.
I like it.	Placet.
You know how good it used to be.	Scis quam bonus esse solebat.
I don't care anymore.	Nolo amplius.
but he did not know.	sed nesciebat.
It was not enough.	Erat parum.
For I knew.	Sciebam enim.
And something else.	Et aliquid aliud.
I don't feel it.	Non sentio.
I know you are pretty sure.	Satis certo scio te esse.
But he did not say nothing.	Sed nihil non dixit.
But it is not too bad.	Sed non nimis malum est.
But this does not.	Sed hoc non habet.
will have to do something.	aliquid faciendum mihi erit.
They are all the same.	Idem omnes.
Unless there was.	Nisi erat.
I don't know why we're here.	Nescio cur hic sumus.
I did not know.	Nesciebam.
All right.	Recte omnino est.
Which was enough.	Quod satis erat.
He is more than a father.	Plus est quam pater.
Which is not true.	Quod non est verum.
To me for sure.	Ad me certe.
I don't know what they are.	Nescio quid sunt.
for he did not know what he was going to do.	nesciebat enim quid esset quod facturus esset.
But he was not there.	Sed non erat enim.
It was good.	Bonum erat.
What did you do yesterday?	Quid heri facis?
This is the same thing.	Idem hic est.
For he knew what it was.	Sciebat enim quid esset.
With anyone.	Cum quis.
Makes enough money.	Satis pecuniae facit.
They are not mine anymore.	Non sunt meum amplius.
And it is evil.	Et malum est.
I like it I like it.	Placet tibi hoc placet.
Not all but	Non omnes, sed.
but he could not speak.	sed loqui potuit.
You're all in it together.	Omnes simul in eo es.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
He was too young.	Nimis puer erat.
I knew you well.	Sciebam bene.
I have yet much to say.	Adhuc multa habeo dicere.
I know for sure.	Vere scio.
It was certain what was to be done.	Certum erat quid faciendum esset.
I have seen nothing of this.	Nihil ex hoc vidi.
Look at yourself very well.	Optime vide te ipsum.
Tomorrow at least tomorrow	Cras certe cras.
What was that? 	Quid erat illud?
He came to us and bought a house for us.	Venit ad nos, et pro nobis emit domum.
You don't want this to happen.	Hoc tibi non vis fieri.
Something is very wrong.	Aliquid valde mali est.
That's the same thing indeed.	Id ipsum quidem.
Someone like you.	Aliquis similis tibi.
I need to go home.	Ire domum opus est.
You know that this was done.	Scis hoc esse factum.
Never, never, never.	Numquam, numquam, numquam.
This is not true.	Hoc non est verum.
He does and says what you think.	Agit et dicit quae cogitas.
What he says is so.	Quod dicit ita est.
i know that it was.	scio fuisse.
But not at all.	Sed non nulla.
I'm definitely going to do it again.	Im 'certus iterum facturus est.
I call him.	Eum ego.
I know you're doing the job.	Scio te facere officium.
Yes, it was not always.	Etiam nec semper erat.
That is.	Id est.
There is still a lot of work to be done.	Multum opus adhuc faciendum est.
Now is the time that has not been said.	Nunc tempus id nunc non dictum.
But what has been done?	Sed quid factum est.
You are one.	Tu es unus.
But it is not always.	Sed non semper est.
That's a great idea.	Ut id magna est.
There was no need to do it.	Nihil opus erat facere.
I am very pleased.	Ego sum admodum.
I can't really speak.	Non possum vere dicere.
And he knew where he was.	Et scivit ubi esset.
Much has been done.	Multum factum est.
we cannot know.	scire non possumus.
It's not bad.	Malum non est.
You should know this.	Hoc scire debes.
You're not likely.	Verisimile non es.
It is still the same now.	Idem adhuc nunc.
I will tell you this.	Dicam tibi hoc.
So it is.	Ita est.
Which seems really good.	Quod vere bonum videtur.
And another	Et aliud .
She is in school.	In schola est.
That's the same thing too.	Id ipsum etiam.
No one knows when.	Nemo scit quando.
You just don't do it.	Tu solum ne feceris.
Maybe he doesn't think so.	Forsitan non cogitat.
And say	Et dic .
It is time to act.	Tempus est agere.
to her house after school.	Ad domum eius post scholam.
This is also to be done.	Hoc quoque faciendum est.
But that's out of it.	Sed id ex enim.
Tell me why.	Dic quare.
Just not quite happy.	Tantum non satis felix.
She that was	Illa, quae erat
Yes she was right.	Ita recte illa.
He works very well.	Optime agit.
This is your plan.	Tuum est consilium.
If there are men.	Si sunt homines.
You don't want to say it, you don't have it.	Dicere non vis, non habes.
He did not.	Non fecit.
I can't get enough of this.	Non possum satis hoc accipere.
But nothing more.	Sed nihil amplius.
he said 'not likely'.	dixit 'verisimile non est'.
And yes, he said.	Etiam et dictum quam.
I could hardly believe it.	Vix credere potui.
None of this has happened.	Nemo id acciderit.
He does this work.	Hoc opus facit.
We have more to do than that.	Plus habemus quam facere.
But it is not seen.	Sed non videtur.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
My bedroom.	Cubiculum meum.
That's what I thought.	Id quod mihi videbatur.
I wanted her to leave with us.	Volui eam nobiscum relinquere.
This has not been true.	Hoc iam verum non fuit.
And to do that.	Et facere quod.
I'll tell you soon.	Dicam tibi mox.
He comes to her.	Venit ad eam.
I like the future.	Mihi placet futurum.
For he was.	Erat enim.
I'm going right now.	Eo me nunc.
I think it's enough.	Puto satis.
I don't need anything else.	Non opus est mihi aliud.
It would appear.	Videtur.
But now he is well.	Sed nunc bene habet.
One is just.	Unus est iustus.
Thus he is a man.	Sic est homo.
But certainly.	Sed certe.
He was absolutely a man now.	Erat omnino homo nunc.
If you want something, do it.	Si vis aliquid, fac illum.
It was finally done.	Tandem factum est.
So finally this question comes.	Ita tandem haec quaestio venit.
There's something we don't like about you.	Non est quod nos non amo te.
But there is more.	Sed plus est.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
You'd like this one.	Hoc unum velis.
That is, it could be.	Id est, posset.
I wish this would never happen again.	Utinam nunquam hoc futurum sit.
I don't want to talk about it.	Nolo de eo loqui.
I don't believe that he was still there.	Non credo quod adhuc ibi esset.
And here	Et hic.
But not much.	Sed non multum.
It is never too late.	Numquam sero.
But he tries to come to me.	Sed ad me venire conatur.
Not unless.	Non, nisi.
not a lot of help.	Non multum auxilium.
He said so.	Dixit ita.
That's how you get some.	Ut id aliquam quam.
We are not doing anything.	Non sumus quid facit.
I really didn't want to go.	Ego vere ire noluit.
It was not a bad thing.	Male non erat.
I don't feel bad.	Non male sentio.
I have done my job.	Feci officium meum.
Maybe that was it.	Aliquam ut erat.
better than you can do.	melius quam potes facere.
I just want to make you think.	Ego iustus volo te facere cogitas.
But it was well done.	Sed bene factum est.
I was not working with anyone.	Non opus erat cum aliquo.
Don't do it.	Ne facias eum.
I didn't know what to do.	Nesciebam id facturum esse.
am going to do.	sum facturus.
Now that was great.	Nunc id erat magna.
As much as you can.	Tantum est quantum potes.
the matter was.	res erat.
I know this is going to happen.	id futurum scio.
He thought that perhaps one thing was necessary.	Putabat fortasse unum opus esse.
There is none in us.	Nulla in nobis est.
But see.	Sed vide.
To say so.	Ut ita dicam.
There's a lot of work.	Non multum opus est.
Now that was it.	Nunc id erat.
It is good to see.	Bonum est videre.
I don't travel.	Non iter.
That would be enough for both.	Quod satis esset utrumque.
But this is not.	Hoc autem non est.
All this nothing is better.	Quae omnia nihil melius.
I am a man.	homo sum.
It was certain.	Certum erat.
For truly.	Vere enim.
I'm really sorry for this.	Vere paenitet me hoc.
I heard you say something.	Audivi te aliquid dicere.
So now what's happened.	Ita nunc quid acciderit.
It is important to him.	Ei sit amet.
So it is.	Ita est.
But not the same as that.	Sed non ipsum quam.
Ex.	Ex.
I had something about him.	aliquid de eo habui.
Maybe you don't have the money.	Fortasse non pecuniam esse.
At this time he said.	Hoc tempore dixit.
You did not.	Non fecisti.
Not if you want to live.	Non si vis vivere.
i want to see.	videre volo.
There's just about us.	Ibi iustus de nobis.
As stated in the report.	In ut dictum ipsum.
I told him.	Dixi ei.
That's what he knew.	Id sciebat.
I have a plan.	consilium habeo.
in front of a large man.	In quis magna ante.
You have done better.	Melius fecisti.
We all need things.	Omnes nobis opus sunt.
There is no id.	Nulla id.
I think nothing too much.	Nihil nimium puto.
I wasn't sure about that.	Certus non eram quod.
It looks good to you.	Bonum tibi videtur.
Now just go and do it.	Nunc solum ire et facere.
And he refused to leave her again.	Et noluit eam iterum relinquere.
But that is so.	Id autem ita est.
Now it's in you.	Nunc in te est.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
There is no such thing as great.	Nulla ut magna.
Breakfast at home.	Prandium domi.
But that was out of it.	Sed ut ex erat.
You are most likely the same.	Verisimile es idem.
But he himself understood.	Sed ipse intellexit.
He knew for sure.	Pro certo sciebat.
I can't talk about it.	Non possum dicere de illo.
I believe we have done it.	Credo nos fecisse.
I thought you said you wanted help.	Putabam te auxilium velle dixisti.
There is a similar situation here.	Similis res est hic.
That's okay.	Id enim bene.
Certainly not this morning.	Hoc certe non mane.
You are such a good boy.	Tam bonus puer es.
What you can't have.	Quod habere non potes.
The whole work.	Totum opus.
I don't go to school.	Non ad scholam.
He said he was prepared.	Paratus ipse dixit.
This is not true.	Hoc non est.
I have not seen him.	Non vidi eum.
This work is done.	Hoc opus est.
he is with us.	nobiscum est.
But not you, boy.	Sed non tu, puer.
He is such a good guy.	Tam bonus est guy.
This is not going to happen to you.	Non est tibi hic futurum.
I don't know what else.	Nescio quid aliud.
As it was.	Sicut erat.
.	.
I don't know who you are.	Nescio quis sis.
You'll never be there again.	Numquam iterum ibi erit.
That is difficult.	Quod difficile sit.
ENOUGH, ENOUGH.	SATIS, SATIS.
that's too bad.	id malum etiam.
But you know it can be done.	Sed scis fieri.
He said nothing at all.	Nihil omnino dixit.
No not great.	Nulla non magna.
To be honest.	Ut sit amet.
Well, there is no help.	Bene, auxilium non est.
He can't help it.	Eum adiuvare non potest.
He gave us all that we have.	Omnia, quae habemus, nobis dedit.
I love it.	id amo.
At least you know where you are.	Certe scis ubi sis.
Nothing can be done.	Nihil fieri.
This should be	Hoc debet esse
At the same time it was said by him.	In tempus id ipsum a dictum.
Totally not correct.	Prorsus non bene.
He was also one of them.	Etiam quis ex erat.
I can't speak.	Dicere non possum.
I knew when I started.	Sciebam cum incepit.
If you want to do better, you can.	Si vis melius facere, potes.
Yes this has been said before.	Etiam id dictum ante.
Which being so, why did he not say so?	Quod cum ita sit, cur non dixit?
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
All these things together.	Haec omnia simul.
He eats an apple.	Malum comedit.
All in all.	Omnino.
That is enough.	Quod satis sit.
He could be me.	Potuit esse me.
Look soon.	Vide mox.
But as it is now.	Sed ut nunc est.
where is his job.	Ubi est eius officium.
But we can do nothing.	Sed nihil facere possumus.
But as it is.	Sed ut est.
Not in real time.	Non per verum tempus.
But it was not so done.	Sed ita factum non est.
Nothing has been done yet.	Nihil tamen hoc factum est.
For he knew it was time.	Sciebat enim tempus esse.
It was going to happen.	Futurum erat.
That's not true.	Ut 'non est verum.
You did it.	Fecisti eum.
I have tried.	Conatus sum.
No that's great for you.	Nulla id magna enim.
There was no need for this.	Hoc opus non erat.
Absolutely love me.	Omnino amat.
There's only one question.	Ibi modo quaestio est.
It does not please.	Non placet.
there was need to know who did this.	qui hoc fecit scire opus erat.
I am ready.	Paratus sum.
He knew nothing.	Nihil sciebat.
He is still alive.	Ipse adhuc.
I don't know what it is.	Nescio quid sit.
That is not very good.	Quod non est valde.
You can think.	Cogitare potes.
They are not getting on.	Non sunt questus.
All of it.	Ex eo omnes.
But this is not entirely true.	Sed hoc non est omnino verum.
I heard about him this morning.	Hoc mane de eo audivi.
And you.	Et tu.
Too much time has gone.	Nimium tempus abiit.
Please see you again.	Quaeso te iterum.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
We go along with him.	Ire per nos cum eo.
It's not bad.	Non est malum.
We still have it.	Id adhuc habemus.
It would seem that it is not.	Videtur quod non.
This is nothing.	Hoc nihil est.
He was too good.	Nimis bonus ille fuit.
That seemed to help.	Quod auxilium videbatur.
I know and like my father.	Scio et sicut pater.
And this may be true.	Et hoc potest esse verum.
Someone has to buy it.	Aliquis habet eum emere.
but it will be too late.	Sero tamen erit.
I thought it was pretty good.	Putavi satis bonum esse.
The matter is so.	Ita res est.
You'll never stop.	Numquam te prohibere.
It is certainly possible that this is the case.	Fieri certe potest ut ita sit.
I have not said much.	Non multa dixi.
But there was also time.	Sed et tempus erat.
Where could she go?	Quo posset ire?
This could not be done in this way.	Hoc modo fieri non potuit.
It will be fine.	Bene erit.
is it better?	numquid melius.
Best of luck.	Optime felix.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
Morning before breakfast in the morning.	Ante prandium in mane usque ad mane.
Yes it is.	Ita sit.
Well, it's again.	Bene, illud iterum.
He should not be here.	Non debet hic esse.
Really wanted this job.	Hoc officium vere voluit.
You never know who.	Numquam quis.
Too busy, though.	Occupatus, sed.
It's not good to have just one.	Non est bonum habere se iustus.
How can this be done?	Quomodo hoc fieri potest.
You can find something else.	Aliud invenire potes.
And so with men.	Sic et apud homines.
He himself said.	Ipse dixit.
We will not find it again.	Nos non iterum invenire.
You mean me.	Vis me.
Yes I am so sorry.	Ita sum, ita me paenitet.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
Now who is yourself.	Nunc quis ipsum.
That it is still so.	Quod adhuc ita sit.
I'm not really sure how to do this.	Non sum vere certus quomodo hoc facias.
But that was from.	Sed id erat ex.
That may or may not have happened.	Id vel non factum.
No big problem.	Nulla quaestio magna.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est verum.
We live rightly.	Nos recte vivere.
We are three.	Tres sumus.
That perhaps.	Quod fortasse.
Very good.	Ipsum bonum.
But she said that it was not.	Sed haec dixit non esse.
It's a better idea.	Melius illud a.
Please tell me what was said about you.	Quaeso dic mihi quid de te dictum sit.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
You can leave now.	Nunc relinquere potes.
I heard a lot of good things about it.	Multa audivi de eo bona.
Yes that's your job.	Etiam id officium tuum est.
No one can do all things.	Nemo omnia potest.
did not work.	Non opus fecit.
There was nothing he could do, as yet.	Nihil erat quod facere posset, nondum.
He said to himself.	Dixit se.
He never made me alone.	Solus nunquam me fecit.
never forgot.	Numquam oblitus est.
I probably too.	Probabiliter me quoque.
Him, that.	Ipsum, id.
make a decision.	consilium fac.
I don't really want it.	Non vere volo.
You have not done well.	Non bene fecisti.
Good job with that.	Bonum officium cum illo.
That's going to happen.	Id futurum est.
But well and long.	Sed bene et tempore.
Wait for us all.	Mane nos, omnes.
He did not make us understand.	Non fecit nobis intelligere.
I hope it will be as before.	Spero fore ut ante.
But that is not enough.	Sed id parum est.
It was time to think about you.	Tempus erat cogitare de te.
It was hard to understand what this meant.	Difficile erat intelligere quid hoc esset.
It is very well done.	Optime factum est.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
Better for the future.	Melius futurum.
Before it was .	Ante fuit .
it is necessary to speak.	loqui necesse est.
This can speak more than anything.	Hoc plus quam loqui potest.
But perhaps rightly so.	Sed fortasse recte.
Now my boy	Nunc puer meus .
There is nothing new.	Nihil novi est.
I don't have much anymore.	Non multum iam habeo.
But not always.	Sed non semper.
It was easy to find.	Facile erat invenire.
This time with someone is much better.	Hoc tempore apud aliquem multo melius est.
I think this is the way to go.	Puto hoc iter.
It is possible, but not easy.	Fieri potest, sed non facile est.
I knew it before the time.	Sciebam ante tempus.
He wants to do something else.	Aliud facere vult.
I was there.	Ibi eram.
It was done with him.	Factum est cum illo.
Look no further than that.	Non plus quam vide.
I definitely heard you.	Certo te audivi.
Nothing else.	Nihil aliud.
My father didn't tell me.	Pater non indicavit mihi.
And so it was.	Et ita factum est.
he said.	dixit.
Maybe that was nothing.	Aliquam id erat nisi.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
It's not your job.	Non est officium tuum.
there was a need.	opus erat.
Ex.	Ex.
He knows it too.	Novit etiam illud.
I just wanted to know where he was.	Modo scire volui ubi esset.
That's not how.	Ut non quam.
It is enough.	Satis est.
Certainly not today.	Certe non hodie.
It could not have been done, he said.	Fieri non potuit, ipse dixit.
You also.	Tu quoque.
I didn't want to go any further.	Nolui ire amplius.
Most of the time with people.	Plus temporis apud homines.
You can get what comes to you through you.	Accipere potes quod ad te venit per te.
Would you like to do it first.	Vis ut id ante.
I can't speak.	Dicere non possum.
He never looks the same.	Idem numquam spectat.
I don't go to class.	Non ire ad genus.
I am not sure.	Non sum certus.
What do you need not to do?	Quid non debes facere?
If there is any need.	Si quid opus est.
Finally got some work.	Tandem aliquid opus obtinuit.
Well done! 	Bene!
And you.	Et tu.
It seems time to buy.	Tempus emere videtur.
I can't help myself.	Non possum me adiuvare.
Look where you are.	Vide ubi sis.
This was often difficult.	Hoc saepe difficile fuit.
Thus he said.	Sic ille.
To know for themselves.	Scire sibi.
Something is not right about it.	Aliquid non recte de illo.
Nothing, however, I know.	Nihil tamen novi.
This is not true!	Hoc verum non est!
You know this.	Scis hoc.
It's probably a good thing.	Probabiliter res bona est.
And he could do well.	Et bene potuit.
But it is not the same.	Sed non ipsum est.
He was not one.	Non unus erat.
You have all right.	Recte habes.
But that's due to the time.	Sed id tempus ex.
Now who is it.	Nunc quis est.
This seemed to do better.	Hoc melius facere videbatur.
I don't like it at all.	Id omnino non placet.
That's one thing.	Id unum est.
Nothing more could be done here.	Nihil amplius hic facere potuit.
I think it's okay.	Puto bene.
I needed more money.	Mihi plus pecuniae opus erat.
I really don't see that.	Ego vere non video esse.
All this is a plan.	Totum hoc consilium est.
I really want to see it.	Ego vere vis videre eam.
That doesn't surprise me.	Quod non miror.
Yesterday I met her teacher.	Heri magister eius occurrit.
You are not my father.	Non pater.
You are not thinking.	Non cogitas.
She says.	Illa dicit.
But we have this plan.	Hoc tamen consilium habemus.
None in no ex.	Nulla in nulla ex.
I have tried here yet.	Hic tamen conatus sum.
I really didn't know what to say.	Ego vere nesciebam quid dicam.
Maybe that's none of it.	Aliquam id nulla ex.
It looks pretty good.	Spectat satis bene factum.
And he comes, and you know.	Et venit, et scis.
But to whom.	Sed ut quam.
You.	Vos.
Not long.	Non diu.
Tomorrow is from none.	Cras a nulla est.
I told you.	Dixi vobis.
Well, there was none.	Bene, nulla erat.
I'm going anyway.	Eo tamen.
I knew it to be.	sciebam eam esse.
Both are correct.	Utrumque recte.
It is not the same.	Ipsum non.
But she did not do what he said to her.	Illa tamen non fecit quod dixit ei.
But the dog was never a dog.	Sed canis numquam canis fuit.
Do a good job.	Fac officium bonum.
He did not know where he was.	Nesciebat ubi.
You're here.	Nimium hic.
need to see you.	opus est te videre.
All in all.	Omnino dictum est.
Don't talk anymore.	Non amplius loqui.
I'm not so sure.	Non sum tam certus.
This is now.	Hoc nunc est.
He said this.	Hoc dixit.
But this is little to anything.	Sed hoc parum ad aliquid.
I'm fine.	Bene sum.
Do what you do better.	Fac quod melius facis.
It does not please.	Non placet.
It is not easy to speak well at all.	Non est omnino facile bene loqui.
You know you have.	Scis te habere.
Everyone was out there.	Fuit et ibi omnes.
This is not about him.	Hoc non est de illo.
Maybe he thought.	Forsitan putabat.
You probably don't like it.	Probabile non placet.
It could be something.	Esse aliquid quod posset.
The countenance was the countenance.	Vultus erat vultus.
Nothing bad.	Nisi malum.
We are not there.	Non sumus ibi.
You only respect.	Tu modo quantum.
you already know.	iam scis.
I don't even want to see it.	Ego ne id quidem volo videre.
Look after him.	Vide post se.
You don't.	Non facis.
It was not easy.	Non erat facile.
I certainly didn't tell him to play.	Certe non dicam illum ludere.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
I am not gone.	Abiit ut non sum.
He said all this.	Hoc totum dixit.
The same thing for you.	Idem tibi.
You can do this.	Hoc facere potes.
He made his way again.	Iterum iter fecit.
I love traveling.	Iter amo.
That day never comes.	Ille dies numquam venit.
He said the truth.	Ille verum dixit.
You are evil.	Vos malum.
It was easy to find.	Facile erat invenire.
i can't talk to you.	nec possum loqui tecum.
But not yet.	Nondum, sed.
It will never be the same.	Numquam idem futurum est.
Even if he wants to.	Etiam ut nisi velit.
I just tell the truth.	Modo verum dicam.
He knew what he wanted.	Sciebat quid vellet.
Let us know.	Fac nobis, scis.
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
It is not probable, certainly not at all.	Probabile non est, certe non omnino.
Maybe that's always something.	Aliquam id aliquam semper.
Much more than that.	Multo quam.
Maybe it was true.	Fortasse verum fuit.
It is time to go to dinner.	Tempus est ire ad prandium.
In the text	In illud.
Now it is up to you.	Nunc, est ad te.
I need to help you with this.	Hoc tibi opus est ut adiuvet.
All this to you.	Omnia haec ad vos.
But not.	Sed non.
It's time for more time than that.	Aliquam in tempus quam.
Maybe too much time, though.	Nimis fortasse tempus, sed.
It was probably that, but not well.	Probabile erat id, sed non bene.
I thought nothing at the time.	Ego nihil eo tempore putavi.
Well, it looks bad.	Bene, malum spectat.
I have to go.	Habeo ire.
Nothing seems to work.	Nihil opus videtur.
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
He did not like.	Nolebat.
Maybe you are nothing.	Tibi fortasse nihil sunt.
No one knows what will happen.	Quid futurum sit nemo scit.
It's not easy.	Non est facile.
Maybe he didn't know what it was.	Fortasse nesciebat quid esset.
he ought not to remain.	manere non debet.
But it is too much evil.	Sed nimium est malum.
It's really good.	Vere bonus est.
Everything was right.	Quae recte fuit.
But neither did he.	Sed nec quam.
I know better.	Melius scio.
No, for	Non, enim.
Now I don't want no.	Nunc non velit nulla.
Or not now.	Vel non nunc.
I have already tried.	Iam conatus sum.
You know what you mean.	Scis vis!.
I will tell you.	Dicam tibi.
you know where you want to go.	tu scis quo vis ire.
I don't need to talk about you.	De vobis loqui non debeo.
So here they are.	Ita hic sunt.
How much.	Quam multa.
Which is not true.	Quod ne verum sit.
That's a great big thing.	Ut id magna magna.
It is probable that it would be so.	Probabile est sic esse.
You should see me soon.	Mox me videre debes.
Where?' 	Ubi?'
i love cum.	amo cum.
There was nothing new at the time.	Nihil novi in ​​tempore fuit.
This was only last night.	Hoc tantum nocte.
Not one car is gone.	Non unus currus abiit.
he did not know how he knew.	nesciebat quomodo sciebat.
I don't have a house.	Non habeo domum.
I didn't have to know why.	Non habuit cur scire.
He could have done better.	Melius potuit.
It's not just about me.	Hoc non est solum de me.
Let me help you.	Fac me tibi.
No man is anything.	Nemo homo est aliquid.
Make your own.	Tuum fac.
I can't be the only person here.	Solus hic homo esse non possum.
Yes, that was said.	Etiam id dictum erat.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
If he has, well.	Si habet, bene.
I could not find his car.	Currus eius invenire non potui.
It's fine for you.	Bene tibi est.
What have you done? 	Quid fecisti?
You can't say nothing.	Nihil dicere non potes.
Now I am certain.	Nunc certum habeo.
I just made fun of him.	Iustus cum eo me fecit amet.
This certainly will happen.	Hoc certe futurum est.
I can't believe it.	Non potest credere me esse.
It is your job to do this.	Tuum est hoc facere.
His work is gone.	Suo opus abiit.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
There was none except that.	Nulla id erat nisi.
Well "no" would be right.	Bene, "nemo" recte esset.
The man was very busy.	Vir erat valde occupatus.
It's really bad.	Malum est vere.
which he could not do.	Quae facere non potuit.
It is not his time.	Non suo tempore.
He would do it if he could.	Faceret si posset.
Well, this looks good.	Bene, hoc bonum spectat.
Don't talk to me like this.	Noli me sic loqui.
I was the first one.	Eram primum.
I like it this way.	Hoc modo placet.
What should i do for you.	Quid faciam tibi.
Look where it is.	Vide ubi sit.
He said nothing.	Nihil dixit.
That's kind of it.	Id genus est.
It is a great thing.	Res magna est.
That is not good.	Quod non est bonum.
He could not.	Non potuit.
I do not know the name.	Nomen nescio.
It was really like that.	Quod vere simile fuit.
I was doing a lot of things.	Multum facerem.
So where are you from?	Sic, ubi ex te?
Not before.	Nec ante.
But it is not certain.	Sed non certum est.
And how did you do it	Et quomodo fecisti .
If only she didn't want so much.	Si tantum nolebat eam tantum.
He knows who he is.	Scit quis ille sit.
Counsel is counsel.	Consilium est consilium.
That's another thing he said.	Id aliud dixit.
He could not know himself.	Scire se non potuit.
He's always been here.	Hic iam semper est.
He was sure.	Certus erat.
This one is enough.	Hic satis unus est.
He does this very well.	Hoc optime facit.
Well and great too.	Bene et magna nimis.
That's where he was himself.	Ut in erat ipsum.
I would like to.	Vellem.
It wasn't enough yet.	Non satis adhuc erat.
He was not a man.	Homo non erat.
He was kind.	Genus erat.
Well done.	Bene factum.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
Perhaps it is better.	Melius fortasse sit.
But this is what he did.	Sed hoc est quod fecit.
He speaks nothing but himself.	Nihil nisi ipse loquitur.
That's not to say.	Ut non dictum.
i feel bad.	male sentio.
I think something's wrong.	Aliquid mali puto.
but he has to believe.	sed habet credere.
Well he has to say what he wants to say.	Bene habet dicere quod vult dicere.
He knows that too.	Novit id quoque.
The situation is the same.	Sic se res habet.
You probably think more.	Plus tibi, probabiliter cogitas.
And there is nothing wrong with this.	Et hoc nihil est mali.
It was not that kind.	Non erat id genus.
I would not tell you.	Tibi dicere nolui.
This has to be true.	Habet hoc verum.
But as you have me.	Sed ut me habes.
Certainly never.	Certe numquam.
Well, that can't be true.	Bene, id verum esse non potest.
It was certainly not so bad.	Non ita certe malum fuit.
I can't always talk about it.	De eo loqui non possum, semper.
And very much.	Valde autem.
All right now.	Omnes iam.
Talk about something.	Aliquid loqui.
and	, et.
Just do it.	Solum fac id.
You just want something more.	Vos iustus volo plus aliquid.
we can have.	habere possumus.
He is a good man.	Is est ille bonus.
Everything is with you.	Omnia tecum.
I feel sure about this.	de hoc certo sentio.
We are in it.	In illud sumus.
that's what you don't want to be done to you.	id est Quod tibi fieri non vis.
Who did this?	Quis hoc fecit?
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
He wanted this.	Hoc voluit.
We can't even do this now.	Ne hoc quidem nunc possumus.
But he never came.	Sed numquam venit.
Thus he did.	Sic fecit.
That's for sure.	Id certe ita est.
I can only speak for myself.	Tantum possum pro me loqui.
Not for you.	Nec tibi.
Ex, ex, ex.	Ex, ex, ex.
I'm sorry for being you.	Paenitet me esse te.
But it is not going to happen.	Sed non futurum est.
It was another time, another time.	Erat aliud tempus, aliud tempus.
Not so much at all.	Non tantum omnes.
When we have more, it's never enough.	Cum plus habemus, numquam satis est.
He also has a wife.	Etiam uxorem habet.
But you have to stay here.	Sed habes hic manere.
It was almost always.	Erat fere.
I don't like this.	Non placet hoc.
And we too.	Et nos quoque.
No matter trying to talk with him.	Nulla res est cum eo loqui conatur.
morning to do.	mane ut faciam.
Maybe even before the great day.	Aliquam vel magna ante.
That afternoon he was there.	Quod erat ibi meridiem.
i have to be good.	habeo bonum esse.
I don't know where.	Nescio ubi.
It's a great question.	Est quaestio magna.
It was great.	Erat magna.
I know good things are in you.	Scio bona in te esse.
Not only for me, but also for you.	Non solum mihi, sed etiam tibi.
No one wants to be yourself.	Nulla in velit ipsum.
But the time will never come.	Sed numquam ad futurum tempus.
That's pretty good.	Quod satis bene.
I have done it.	id feci.
This looks good to me.	Hoc bonum mihi spectat.
so sorry.	ita me paenitet.
He said not much.	Non multum dixit.
I don't like to talk.	Non placet loqui.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
That's how bad they are.	Id quam mali sunt.
I don't want anything from you anymore.	Nolo aliquid a te amplius.
This he wished to do, but certainly would.	Hoc facere voluit, sed certe voluit.
But there was only one.	Sed non erat nisi.
For he was.	Erat enim.
We are after all.	Post omnes sumus.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
Have you forgotten something?	Non es oblitus aliquid?
Don't see nothing.	Noli videre nihil.
I don't know how it is.	Nescio quomodo sit.
If there is nothing, it is nothing.	Si nihil est, nihil est.
Not from you.	Non ex tu.
Just love you.	Iustus amo.
It's time to do something.	Aliquam id aliquam est.
He didn't know what to do.	Nesciebat quid faceret.
That it was .	Quod esset .
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
Don't get more	Noli plus
Can't do anything.	Non potest aliquid facere.
Certainly he would not.	Noluit certe.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
It did not come.	Is non venit.
He made it happen.	Fieri fecit.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
Get yourself out of it.	Ut et ipsum ex.
It is still there.	Ibi adhuc est.
You want nothing to do with him.	Nihil tibi vis cum eo agere.
Is it you? 	Estne tu?
But today is not a good day.	Sed hodie non est dies bonus.
We're not done yet.	Non tamen factum sumus.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
I didn't want to.	Non volui.
That was my name.	Id erat nomen mihi.
And you can find whatever you want easily and quickly.	Et quod vis facile et cito invenire potes.
I know it's good too.	Scio etiam ei bonum esse.
But you before.	Sed tu ante.
We can't speak better than we can do.	Melius dicere non possumus quam facere possumus.
I'm not yet ready to talk to you.	Ego te nondum loqui paratus es.
It is time to take some time.	Aliquam tempus ut est id tempus.
It is never enough.	Numquam satis.
He didn't want to see it.	Noluit videre illud.
I think it's better to see.	Puto melius videre.
It's good to be alone.	Non est bonum esse solum.
It was not to say, neither for me either.	Dicere non erat, nec mihi vel.
Can not.	Non potest.
I have heard this.	Audivi hoc.
Not enough is good.	Parum est bonum.
This is certain.	Hoc certum est.
I could not act rightly.	Recte agere non potui.
We are not yet with you.	Non tamen apud te sumus.
Unless you have something better.	Nisi quid habes melius.
Nothing is the same.	Nihil quod idem.
She is gone now and she did.	Abiit illa nunc et fecit.
He was not yet speaking with him.	Nondum erat cum eo loqui.
Well, maybe he did.	Bene fortasse fecit.
He could not do more, and he would not.	Non potuit amplius facere et noluit.
Certainly not in me.	Certe non in me.
But he is still going.	Sed adhuc eat.
This meal was just fine.	Hoc prandium tantum bene erat.
It's been good.”	Suus 'bonus fuit'.
He loves her more than he really does.	Is eam quam vere amat.
we have by.	habemus per.
Certainly it is so.	Certe ita est.
I really don't know.	Ego vere nescio.
We need more money.	Plus pecuniae nobis opus est.
This can be good and bad.	Hoc potest esse bonum et malum.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
It was very fun to see him.	Eum videre erat amet ipsum.
At last.	Tandem.
Or so he said.	Vel sic dixit.
I really tried.	Ego vere conatus sum.
Now it is true.	Modo verum est.
When this is not, this is not.	Quando hoc non est, hoc non est.
Now tell me the truth.	Nunc verum dic.
Not without her help.	Non sine eius auxilio.
I know one thing.	unum scio.
And again it is true.	Et iterum verum est.
I tried to persuade you all.	Tibi persuadere conatus sum omnibus.
Tell me this.	Dic mihi hoc.
Not with me, but with her.	Non mecum, sed cum illa.
You are not here.	Non huc.
You are nothing to me.	Nihil mihi es.
There is no post office for this.	Nulla post haec officium.
It is important to say great things.	Aliquam sit amet dictum magna.
Which indeed has been done.	Quod quidem factum est.
But not from him.	Sed non ex ipsum.
Not much.	Non multum.
No one was really scared.	Nemo vere vix fuit.
I need to find something.	Mihi opus est aliquid invenire.
i want to say.	dicere volo.
But the teacher can't do this to you.	Sed hoc tibi facere non potest magister.
It should not be so.	Sic non debet.
That was after.	Id post erat.
He was a happy man.	Erat vir felix.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
You, however.	Tu tamen.
That man never, ever wanted to see him again.	Vir illa numquam, umquam iterum videre voluit.
I just don't want to.	Ut non velit.
This is how it started.	Hoc est quomodo incepit.
Now is a very happy time.	Nunc sit amet tempus ipsum.
Certainly to me.	Mihi certe.
This year.	Eo anno.
Certainly you know.	Certe scis.
I hope you can hear me now.	Spero me nunc audire potes.
I know many things.	Scio multa.
So also here.	Ita etiam hic.
i don't know what to do.	quid faciam nescio.
And you never know.	Numquam et.
But it was something else.	Aliud tamen erat.
You can stay there.	Potes ibi manere.
I can see what you are doing.	Videre possum quid facias.
Not so.	Non ita.
I think it is more than that.	Puto plus esse quam illud.
By ??????????? 	Per ?????????
it is before time	ante tempus est.
So far still.	Ita multo adhuc.
He does this alone.	Hoc solum facit.
Now they are.	Nunc sunt.
No one speaks like this.	Nemo sic loquitur.
Look and see.	Vide et vide.
This is all.	Hoc totum est.
That was for sure.	Ut certe erat.
It will be that way in the future.	Erit eo modo in futurum.
It is not bad.	Non malum.
So we've seen.	Sic nos vidi.
Maybe you have one too.	Unum etiam fortasse habes.
That was difficult.	Quod difficile fuit.
I knew he would do it, and I did.	Sciebam facturum esse, et feci.
I was a boy, I could not do it.	Puer fui, facere non potuit.
Not unless.	Non, nisi.
I need you.	opus est tibi.
That's not his job.	Quod suum officium non est.
And you're right.	Et tu recte.
You are not right.	Non recte.
You do your work.	Tuum opus facis.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
He does good work.	Bonum opus facit.
It is getting long enough.	Satis diu questus est.
But no no no.	Sed non nulla nulla.
So it seems you've been there.	Ita videtur te ibi fuisse.
It was something great.	Aliquid magna erat.
yes not always for.	Etiam non semper enim.
It could be great for him.	Posset esse magna ei.
but it was still good enough.	sed adhuc satis bonum erat.
But he did better.	Sed melius fecit.
he knows too much.	nimium novit.
I was there.	Ibi eram.
I'm here for you too.	Sum hic tibi etiam.
Or at least you know.	Vel certe scis.
The same thing happened.	Hoc simile factum est.
To it.	Ad eam.
but he did so.	sed ita fecit.
He has to know.	Scire habet.
That's a lot of fun.	Ut sit amet dictum est.
I just wanted to do what was there.	EGO iustus volo fac quod ibi erat.
There was nothing in him.	Nihil erat in eo.
She didn't know when it was enough.	Nesciebat quando satis esset.
Not really.	Non vere.
So it is with me.	Sic mecum est.
And I knew that already.	Jam id quoque sciebam.
It looked tense.	Videbatur temporis.
But it cannot be.	Sed non potest esse.
He's still alive.	Hic adhuc est.
There was no one who was none.	Nulla quis nulla erat.
He knew what he meant.	Sciebat quid sibi vellet.
Just let me talk.	Modo fac me loqui.
It is certainly possible.	Fieri certe potest.
You are not one.	Non unum.
But that was not true.	Quod tamen non fuit.
It is nothing else.	Nihil aliud est.
She met the man.	Vir illa occurrit.
And now he comes here again.	Et nunc hic iterum venit.
And you know too.	Et scis etiam.
Well soon.	Bene cito.
what we have.	quod habemus.
I can't see how we can do it.	Non possum quomodo id facere possumus.
I need this to be done.	Mihi opus est hoc fieri.
He wanted my room.	Cubiculum meum voluit.
It was very busy.	Erat valde occupatus.
I want you ready tomorrow.	Cras te paratus volo.
This could be great.	Posset magna hic esse.
Breakfast is almost so easy.	Prandium est fere tam facile.
All in all.	Omnino.
It's time to be.	Aliquam sit.
the things I feel.	quae sentio.
But it is better to do it.	Sed melius est ut facias.
He did not know what to do next.	Nesciebat quid faciendum.
No.	Non.
He was finally home!	Tandem domi erat!
And what time.	Et quod tempus.
He did nothing.	Nihil fecit.
Now, here you are.	Modo, hic es.
It is bad.	Malum est.
All this was made by itself.	Hoc totum per se factum est.
Something really, really, really bad.	Aliquid vere, vere, vere malum.
It was before the time.	Erat ante tempus.
And now you.	Et nunc te.
'duty'	' officium '.
Never do that yourself.	Numquam id ipsum.
But also yourself.	Sed et te ipsum.
That's what it was.	Id quod ei.
Please don't do it.	Quaeso ne feceris.
Maybe that was it.	Aliquam id erat.
It was really good.	Erat vere bona.
You can also.	Potes etiam.
It was a thing to do.	Rem facere erat.
He thinks nothing but work.	Nihil nisi opus cogitat.
I had to say.	Dictum habui.
But there was a lot to be said.	Sed sit amet dictum erat.
Which I did so.	Quod ita feci.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Hoc nihil mali est.
yes it is not true.	Etiam non est verum.
The truth is what you are thinking.	Verum est quod cogitas.
and there was one man.	et unus homo erat.
But it is not easy.	Sed non est facile.
I don't know anything about you.	Nescio quid de te.
The situation is not the same.	Nec ita se res habet.
This is okay for you.	Hoc bene sit tibi.
I know that it is mine too.	Meum quoque esse scio.
Happy about this, for sure.	Felix de hoc, certe.
What did he do?	Quod non fecit!
There is a lot to talk about.	Multa loqui.
I hope it will be.	Spero fore.
that it is possible.	quod fieri potest.
He is who he is.	Eum ipsum quis est.
This afternoon he said that he was single.	Hoc post meridiem dixisse se unum esse.
Don't like me.	Non amo me.
I am not.	Non sum ego.
But he does not speak.	Sed nec loquitur.
You, me, you all.	Vobis, mihi, omnibus.
This could not be done.	Hic non potuit.
Good morning!	Bonum mane!
This wasn't a problem.	Hoc non erat quaestio.
I've never met him.	Nunquam ei occurrit.
I've never seen it before.	Numquam ante ut.
For him.	Pro eo.
He was always here.	Hic semper fuit.
I just said it.	Modo modo dixisti.
Never, and never.	Numquam, et numquam.
they are still men.	adhuc homines sunt.
Unless he wants.	Nisi velit.
I just want to see.	EGO iustus volo videre.
That means a lot.	Id est multum.
You can't see all things, there is none.	Non omnia videre potes, non est.
You can stay here if you want.	Hic manere potes si vis.
I hope you're great.	Spero te magna.
He thought he was something.	Putabat se esse aliquid.
Where do you like to go this year?	Placet tibi quo hoc anno ire?
Good work.	Bonum opus est.
It is a matter of design.	Res est consilium.
He loves you.	Amat te.
If so, okay.	Si ita, bene.
In time itself.	In tempus ipsum.
It's time to say great things.	Aliquam tempus dictum magna.
But that was before none.	Sed id ante nulla.
And he did not do well.	Et non bene fecit.
I just stay at home.	Modo domi manere.
It looks really good.	Spectat vere bonum.
I didn't want to do it now.	Nolui nunc facere.
I didn't want to do this.	Nolui hoc facere.
Now I have a plan.	Iam consilium habeo.
Only me now.	Tantum me, nunc.
It's not much.	Non multum est.
Someone you can trust.	Aliquis potes credere.
But more could be done.	Plus tamen fieri potuit.
But it could not be done.	Sed fieri non potuit.
He does everything in his own time.	Omnia suo tempore facit.
Now he knows me.	Nunc novit me.
I don't know who you are.	Nescio quis sis.
Yes, but how.	Etiam sed quam.
The same with me.	Idem apud me.
If you're late, you're late.	Si sero es, sero es.
Almost nothing has been done.	Fere nihil factum est.
You're fine too.	Bene quoque es.
But perhaps it does not seem so difficult.	Sed fortasse non ita difficile videtur.
It's good for us.	Bene nobis est.
It is important for you.	Aliquam sit amet enim.
Which does not seem so bad.	Quod non ita malum videtur.
This is not to be so.	Hoc non est ita esse.
Do what you need.	Facere quod debes.
This work is done quickly.	Cito hoc opus est.
And we can speak from it.	Et ex eo possumus dicere.
He knew how to do it.	Scivit id facere.
Maybe I'm started.	Forsitan me incepit.
Me for lunch.	Prandium in me.
Not the time before, but now.	Non tempus ante, sed nunc.
Which is true?	Quod verum est?
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
You can find me.	Me potes invenire.
He was to him also.	Erat ei et ipse.
But not.	Sed non.
They are not.	Non sunt.
I just want you to know.	Ego iustus volo te scire.
So good.	Ita bonum.
This was certain.	Hoc certum erat.
He can't do this.	Hoc facere non potest.
I want to be in this.	in hoc esse volo.
No, not before him.	Nulla non ante ipsum.
But neither was that.	Sed nec id erat.
So that's what it is.	Ita quod quid est.
She's finally like you.	Illa tandem amo te.
It never occurred to me.	Nunquam mihi sic occurrit.
I just didn't know.	Modo nesciebam.
And not.	Et non.
One for sure.	Pro certo unus.
I didn't know what the situation was.	Nesciebam quid res esset.
And he went away.	Et abiit ille.
He could not believe it.	Posset credere.
At last I want to be happy.	Tandem felix volo.
I don't like him.	Non sicut eum.
He can truly act.	Vere agere potest.
I have something for you.	Habeo tibi aliquid.
It was not this morning.	Non erat hoc mane.
It's his name.	Nomen eius est.
Or only wanted to know.	An tantum scire voluit.
I didn't say much.	Dicere non multum.
He comes soon.	Is mox venit.
Not the same.	Non ipsum.
when he was.	quando erat.
Even if there was need, say nothing at all.	Etiam si opus esset, nihil omnino dicere.
Are you okay.	Esne bene.
I believe that this could be done.	quod fieri posse credo.
Not even one.	Ne unum quidem.
That's how he played it.	Ut id ipsum quam.
They are.	Sunt.
Everyone knows for sure.	Nescit certe.
So there you have it.	Sic ibi habes.
Or to all three.	Vel ad omnes tres.
Now you don't need to know.	Nunc scire non debes.
Both can be.	Utrumque potest esse.
But the matter is the case.	Sed se res ita se res habet.
Maybe he does.	Fortasse facit.
and he has it.	et habet eam.
But there is another.	Sed est aliud.
Not just about you and what you want.	Non solum de te et quod vis.
i'm going to do poorly.	male facturus sum.
We are here.	Hic sumus.
Yes it is started.	Ita est incepit.
We don't have much time.	Non multum tempus habemus.
Yes, but there was some.	Etiam sed aliquam erat.
Morning after one.	Mane post unum.
we can leave.	relinquere possumus.
He didn't do it.	Non faceret.
I thought a lot about it.	de illo multum cogitavi.
It's hard to know where to look.	Difficile est scire ubi vide.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
i want it badly.	illud male volo.
Dad got the job.	Pater obtinuit officium.
What do you think you've done.	Quod tu fieri putas.
I need someone.	Mihi opus est aliquem.
He wanted many things.	Multa voluit.
You can be a boy.	Puer esse potes.
I can't do this.	Hoc facere non possum.
said the teacher.	dixit magister.
But this was not going to happen.	Sed hic non erat futurum.
If you have something, do it yourself.	Si habes aliquid, fac ut facias.
It is bad to know.	Malum est scire.
Only	Tantum.
Nothing much better to do.	Nihil multo melius facere.
Maybe it's not true.	Fortasse non est verum.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
But now he could do it.	Sed iam quod posset facere.
He always wants to do it.	In id semper velit.
This started today.	Hoc hodie incepit.
I have some interest.	Habeo aliquam rem.
But too often it is too little to say.	Sed nimis saepe parum est dicere.
This is no longer there.	Hoc iam non est.
I also want to do something else.	Etiam aliud agere volo.
I thought you were.	Putavi esse te.
Never.	Numquam.
I don't know the future.	Nescio futurum.
It could be done again.	Fieri iterum potuit.
I'm glad you're well.	Gaudeo te bene esse.
No statement from any.	Nulla dictum aliquam ex.
But that's what it is.	Sed id quam est.
That's there.	Id ibi.
He was still alive.	Adhuc erat.
In this way he did.	Hoc modo fecit.
That would be good.	Quod bonum esset.
I see it, I do.	Illud video, ego.
Hardly anyone knows these things today.	Haec hodie vix aliquis novit.
Who knows why.	Quis scit quare.
He is a good man, you want him.	Bonus homo est, eum velis.
He didn't want to play often.	Saepe ludere nolebat.
I don't like this.	Hoc non placet.
let me stay without you.	me sine te manere.
Now there is none.	Nunc non est.
It is a great thing.	Res magna est.
There is no email	Nulla quis.
I could not leave it to myself.	Non potui me id relinquere.
But as it is now.	Sed ut nunc est.
I don't know about you baby.	Nescio de te, puer.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
There was something wrong with that guy.	Aliquid mali fuit de illo guy.
what could have been wrong?.	Quid enim mali potuit ?.
now I do not believe.	iam non credo.
I hope we can get her job soon.	Spero eam primum officium possumus.
got it.	id obtinuit.
This is not seen.	Hoc non videtur.
It is possible, however.	Fieri potest tamen.
He did not know what was wrong.	Nesciebat quid mali esset.
No one can hear.	Nemo potest audire.
Not me.	Non me.
Please do something.	Quaeso te aliquid.
Not better yet.	Nec melius tamen.
There was no way to go.	Ire non erat.
Never was, never was.	Numquam fuit, numquam fuit.
He also loves traveling.	Etiam iter amat.
It was for sure.	Erat certe.
That's the way it is now.	Id ipsum modo nunc est.
Here you are.	Hic tu.
We've never been here before.	Numquam ante hic sumus.
I just don't know what.	Modo nescio quid.
Both are easy.	Facile est utrumque.
I need you more than this.	Hoc tibi plus quam tibi opus est .
Perhaps no one knew.	Forsitan nemo scivit.
He ought to do well	Bene bene debet .
Just don't like it.	Iustus non placet.
First thing you want from me.	Primum a me aliquid velis.
It will not be hard to find.	Non sit difficile invenire.
This is if you want to get it.	Hoc est, si vis accipere.
What he does not do.	Quod non facit.
How good it's been.	Quam bona suus esse potest.
Maybe it was or was.	Aliquam vel erat erat.
He said nothing, I did not hear.	Nihil dixit, non audivi.
There is no question.	Nulla quaestio est.
You are not doing well today.	Non bene facis hodie.
This year.	Eo anno.
It's not going to happen.	Non futurum est.
Can't do enough.	Satis facere non potest.
One thing could do something.	Una res posset aliquid facere.
I'm not sure how you did it.	Non certus sum quomodo id fecerit.
He wanted something more, he wanted something else.	Plus aliquid voluit, aliud voluit.
What do you have in it.	Quid habes in eo.
I think he didn't know what to do.	Puto eum nescire quid sit faciendum.
No one really knows much about him.	Nemo multum de eo vere scit.
That could be bad.	Posset esse id malum.
You are the father.	Tu pater es.
He was willing to do so.	Velit id erat.
He was going to talk to him.	Dicere ei erat.
It is not.	Non est.
In this way.	Hoc modo.
It's not the same as getting to it.	Non idem sibi questus est.
He knew, even if he did not.	Scivit, etiam si non fecit.
Tell me what happened.	Dic quid factum est.
At length he said.	Tandem dixit.
How bad do you want to be.	Quomodo mali vis.
I don't care about that.	Nolo rem.
We, you and you.	Nobis, te et te.
I'm trying really hard.	Im 'vere difficile conatur.
Time to travel	Tempus est iter fieri?
That is possible.	Quod fieri potest.
You don't have anything.	Non habes aliquid.
But it is certain to do, if it is possible.	Sed certum est facere, si potest.
They are not here anymore.	Non sunt hic amplius.
I wanted to do better.	melius facere volui.
I can't say why.	Non possum dicere quare.
But generally this is not true.	Fere autem hoc non est.
I will do this at home.	Hoc faciam domi.
That's where it is.	Id ubi est.
It's not just talking.	Is non modo loquitur.
You can almost always get three.	Semper fere tres accipere potes.
Maybe never.	Fortasse numquam.
she loves school.	scholam amat.
I can't believe this.	Non possum hoc credere.
You are not, neither are you.	Non es, nec tu.
Well, without us.	Bene, sine nobis.
I want to be there wrong.	Volo ut ibi esse mali.
who could have done this.	quis id fieri potuit.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
This task doesn't seem so easy.	Hoc opus non tam facile videtur.
.	.
But that was nothing.	Sed id erat nisi.
That's what you want.	Ut quid vis.
He saw me? 	Vidit me?
You are here.	Hic es tu.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I don't know where we are.	Nescio ubi sumus.
But they are not enough for us.	Sed nobis satis non sunt.
if we have the future.	si habemus futurum.
He didn't want to have me.	Noluit me habere.
He's just.	Ille iustus.
And there it is for you.	Et ibi est te.
Please see me now.	Vide quaeso modo me.
I just don't like it.	Modo non placet.
every effort is made to win.	omnes conatus est vincere.
he understood better.	melius intellexit.
We are not like you.	Non sumus sicut tu.
Now I know how bad it is.	Nunc scio quam malum sit.
To be honest with you, much left.	Ut sit amet tecum, multum reliquit.
he wanted to do this of his own.	de suo hoc facere voluit.
I know everything.	Novi omnia.
He does not love her.	Non amat eam.
Well let me help you with it.	Bene me adiuvet te cum illo.
You know it can't be done.	Scis id fieri non posse.
You can do whatever you like.	Potes quod libet.
And you want what you want.	Et vis quid velit.
He knows.	Scit.
I'm going to find the money.	Pecuniam invenire Eo.
And it was .	Erat autem .
I have to say that you are not very good.	Dicere te habeo, non valde bona sunt.
That's too bad.	Quod etiam malum.
I am a man.	Homo sum.
There's a lot of work to do.	Non multum opus est facere.
Now it is not so.	Nunc non est ita.
All three of us.	Omnes nos tres.
I thought so too.	Ita etiam cogitavi.
You don't need this.	Hoc tibi non opus est.
What can we do about this?	Quid de hoc facere possumus?
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
This is quite correct.	Hoc satis recte.
But it's not here.	Sed eius hic non.
It seemed too easy.	Nimis facile videbatur.
Of this, he was certain.	De hoc, certum erat.
It's just that.	Est solum id.
Not even thinking about that.	Quod ne cogitas quidem.
I've never seen, you know.	Nunquam vidi, scis.
i never forgot.	numquam oblitus sum.
There is.	Ibi est.
He ought to think about what he meant.	Debet cogitare quid vellet.
It was always going to be impossible.	Semper erat futurum ut esse non possit.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
He could not speak to her, he could not see her.	Non potuit ei dicere , non potuit eam videre .
So it's great.	Sic magna est.
Certainly not.	Non certe.
All this was true.	Hoc totum verum erat.
We have so much today.	Tantum hodie habemus.
I've done a good job too.	Ego quoque bonum opus feci.
No, not enough.	Non, non satis.
it was his name.	nomen erat.
But it was said by.	Sed a dictum erat.
Now is the time now.	Nunc tempus enim nunc.
Nothing could really do more about him.	Nihil amplius de eo vere facere potuit.
I can't understand this.	Hoc intelligere non possum.
It's not good for me.	Non est mihi bonum.
But it was only said.	Sed non dictum nisi.
He was single.	Erat una.
Tomorrow is great.	Cras in magna est.
He was ready.	Erat paratus.
It is very hard for people to believe.	Valde difficile est credere homines.
My job is important to me.	Ad me officium meum sit amet amet.
That's the very thing indeed.	Id ipsum vere est.
I know what is true.	Scio quid verum sit.
Well, it wasn't too hard.	Bene, non erat difficile.
You have to do both.	Utrumque habes ut facias.
That with .	Id cum .
The future makes me think.	Futurum me cogitare.
You are not alone here.	Et non solum hic.
He wanted this.	Hoc voluit.
This decision was correct.	Recte hoc consilium fuit.
But it is not too late.	Sed non est nimis sero.
There was, however, no plan at all.	Erat tamen omnino non esse consilium.
Today is different.	Hodie aliud est.
There's only one problem.	Nulla tantum quaestio est.
No more than you have.	Non plus quam habes.
But it is not better.	Sed melius non est.
He did this good work.	Hoc bonum opus fecit.
In order for that.	Ut enim ut.
I thought nothing about him.	nihil de eo cogitavi.
Do you want to come with me?	Visne mecum venire?
He made a lot of decisions.	Multum et consilium fecit.
I have a plan.	Habeo consilium.
Help a guy out.	Auxilium a guy sunt.
We can be here.	Possumus hic esse.
I like.	Mihi placet.
This has left me.	Hoc me reliquit.
I have a job for you.	Habeo officium tibi.
Can't think of this now.	Non potest cogitare de hoc nunc.
But it is something.	Sed aliquid est.
and he does it.	et facit.
asked the father.	quaesivit pater.
But we are what we are.	Sed sumus quod sumus.
I think that's it.	Puto id esse.
Which is seen.	Quod videtur.
Nothing.	Nihil.
I can go with him.	Ire possum cum illo.
He refused to speak.	Noluit loqui.
That makes it all the same.	Id facit ut omnes simul.
First off.	Primum eam.
But that was how.	Sed id erat quam.
I just want you to know.	Ego iustus volo te scire.
It was done to date.	Ad diem factum est.
how to get out of.	quam ut ex.
Much better than you can't.	Multo melius quam non potes.
But let's get some more than that.	Sed sit amet aliquam quam.
It was too late for me.	Sero mihi fuit.
& He left.	& reliquit.
Sure.	Certus.
No one is very sad.	Nemo nimis.
It looks to you.	Ad te spectat.
Again he asked me who it was.	Iterum me rogavit ut quis esset.
No one is with him.	Nemo cum eo.
No, no more than ever.	Nulla nec semper quam.
He refused to speak.	Noluit dicere.
Soon I was again myself.	Mox eram iterum me.
And so it is good.	Sic et illud bonum est.
But we can do almost nothing.	Sed nihil fere possumus.
But that's never his.	Sed id numquam eius.
Or you know early spring.	Vel vere mane scis.
I was totally sick.	Male prorsus fui.
I like this one much better.	Hoc unum mihi multo melius placet.
I do not see.	Non video.
He never said the truth.	Numquam verum dixit.
No that's great.	Nulla id magna.
You want to go.	Ire vis.
Please don't call me.	Quaeso ne me.
Not quite right.	Non satis recte.
No one knew how to deal with him.	Nemo scivit cum eo agere.
I, however, believe that this was a bad thing.	Ego tamen hoc malum fuisse credo.
sorry for everything.	Paenitet me omnia.
That is not going to help.	Quod non est ad auxilium.
They are not really too bad.	Non sunt vere etiam mali.
i have to talk to him.	habeo dicere ei.
That he was not.	Ut nec erat.
We cannot stay here.	Hic manere non possumus.
It's something to see.	Est aliquid videre.
I'm still talking to me.	Ego tamen mecum loqui.
He does it again.	Facit illud.
It was nothing, really.	Nihil erat, vere.
It was better to never meet.	Melius fuit ut numquam occurrit.
I think it's true.	verum puto.
You don't have to talk to one.	Loqui non habes usque ad unum.
You can't do anything.	Non potes facere aliquid.
It can take longer to do this.	Potest hoc facere diutius.
But perhaps it was enough.	Sed fortasse satis erat.
The job is what I feel when it comes.	Officium est quod sentio cum illo venit.
What would you like to see done?	Quid vis videre fieri?
But they are not.	Sed non sunt.
Which I think is true.	Quod verum puto.
But as there was none.	Sed ut nulla erat.
He does this for all.	Hoc facit omnibus.
But there is another.	Sed aliud est ibi.
He wanted to do everything.	Omnia facere voluit.
I did not think through this.	Ego per hoc non putavi.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
Not as it seems.	Non, ut videtur.
That's what you do.	Id facis.
Who are you now.	Nunc quis es.
Or even.	Vel etiam.
I just love it so much.	EGO iustus amo is tam.
I was like, yes.	Similis eram, est.
I don't need you when I need you.	Non opus est tibi, cum opus est tibi.
I'm a man.	Im homo.
Even if it were .	Etiam si esset .
Do this work.	Hoc opus fac.
The thing is, they never are.	Rem, numquam sunt.
For he knew what it was.	Sciebat enim quid esset.
I could not do it.	facere non potui.
And you're right.	Et tu recte.
I want to do it again.	Iterum volo facere.
This day made me at that time.	Is dies me fecit illo tempore.
Something's wrong here.	Aliquid hic mali est.
No, not before.	Nulla non ante enim.
I never heard it.	id numquam audivi.
and perhaps never.	et fortasse numquam.
No one knows but us.	Nemo scit nisi nobis.
Don't do this to me.	Hoc mihi ne feceris.
You don't have anything anymore.	Non habes aliquid amplius.
that I feel better.	quod sentio melius.
I don't need it that way.	Non eo modo opus est.
This alone was also true.	Hoc solum verum etiam fuit.
I know exactly.	Prorsus scio.
But that's none of it.	Sed id enim nulla.
To accept himself.	Accipere sibi.
I don't know her well.	Non eam bene scio.
It is absolutely everything.	Omnino est omnia.
But he does in this way.	Sed hoc modo agit.
But that.	Sed illud.
I could not live without you.	sine te vivere non potui.
I am going to do something for him.	Ego aliquid ab eo facturus sum.
That's not like it.	Quod non est simile ei.
Or perhaps not.	Vel fortasse non.
I want to talk.	Ego loqui volo.
And it was.	Et fuit.
And for me.	Et mihi.
I knew better.	melius sciebam.
However, it was not.	Tamen non erat.
Maybe that's not bad.	Forsitan id malum non est.
It is important to say that.	Aliquam sit amet dictum quam.
I couldn't talk or anything.	Non potui loqui vel aliquid.
It's true.	Suus 'verum.
This he does and he owes.	Hoc facit, et debet.
if possible.	si potest.
Nothing really is better than that.	Nihil vere melius quam.
That was bad.	Malum id erat.
You are sure to find something that you can't live without.	Certus es aliquid invenire quod sine te vivere non potest.
You can't think like that.	Non potes cogitare hoc simile.
But you can't stay so.	Sed non potes ita manere.
same as today.	sicut etiam hodie.
In this way it is probable.	Hoc modo probabile est.
Not always.	Nec semper.
This is what he says yes and no.	Hoc est quod dicit sic et non dicit.
You can't believe what he says.	Non potes credere quod dicit.
These are mine.	Haec mea sunt.
But he says nothing.	Nihil tamen dicit.
day was today.	dies erat hodie.
I just arrived on time.	Modo venit in tempore.
I was all over her.	Eius eram omnia.
Even not before him.	Etiam nec ipsum ante.
But that is when, but.	Sed id est cum, sed.
It can't be.	Non potest esse.
So who's right?.	Ita quis recte ?.
Don't listen to this.	Noli hoc audire.
I don't quite know anything right.	Non satis recte scit aliquid.
It's time or something.	Aliquam vel aliquam est.
Him by Himself.	Ipsum a ipsum.
All is not right.	Non recte omnia.
But be very happy.	Sed sit amet ipsum.
never say this.	numquam id.
It was for sure.	Erat certe.
You just never get the chance to do it.	Vos iustus numquam forte facere.
I was not.	non eram.
They can have breakfast, lunch or dinner.	Posse habere prandium, prandium vel cenam.
Too bad it is.	Nimis malum est.
I was in, he was behind me.	Eram in, ipse post me.
Or through it.	Vel per eam.
That's where I need to be.	Ubi id opus esse.
It is also great.	Etiam magna est.
As a.	Sicut a .
That's what I think.	Id puto.
He was looking good.	Ille bonus vultus erat.
I love to play it lol.	Post ludere eam amo.
Maybe he could not.	Fortasse non potuit.
There was a need to stop this.	Hic prohibere opus erat.
I don't think so.	Mihi non videtur.
And so here.	Sic et hic.
I didn't travel well.	Non iter bene.
Where's your lunch.	Ubi prandium tuum est.
he said that this ought to be.	dixit hoc esse debere.
I couldn't see anything about it.	Non potui videre aliquid de illa.
He says this can be done to me.	Hoc mihi dicit fieri posse.
Probably really didn't know anyone there.	Probabiliter quis ibi vere nesciebat.
Tell me where you are.	Dic ubi sis.
i feel bad for that.	quod sentio malum.
Well that's what's going to happen.	Bene sit id quod futurum est.
But there is no such thing as yourself.	Ut sed nulla ipsum.
He was not yet prepared, he was not prepared.	Nondum paratus erat, non paratus erat.
I never bought it for you.	Numquam eam tibi emit.
You can do it by yourself.	Per te facere potes.
The next year, it was.	Proximo anno, fuit.
Talk me out of it.	Loqui me ex eo.
No one has ever seen him.	Nemo eum vidit umquam.
That's easy for sure.	Quod facile certum est.
I can't hear you.	Te audire non possum.
I hope all is well.	Bene spero.
I want to know you.	Scire te volo.
There was no time to love it.	Aliquam sit amet nulla erat.
That's always nice.	Ut id semper nisi.
You can find him here.	Eum hic invenire potes.
He knows it won't be easy.	Scit non facile erit.
I don't think his wife loves me very much.	Uxorem suam non puto me valde amat.
It is getting on.	Questus est a.
which I see now.	quod nunc video.
You can be whatever you want.	Potes esse quod vis.
And nothing ever does this.	Et nihil umquam hoc.
But not there.	Sed non ibi.
I like it.	Mihi placet illud.
I think that is.	Puto hoc est.
we can never.	numquam possumus.
Good not great.	Bonum non magna.
And rightly so.	Et recte.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
That's up to you.	Id est ad vos.
I believe everything he says.	Credo omnia quae dicit.
with stitch.	SUO.
This is what you have to do.	Hoc est quod habes facere.
He was not here.	Hic non erat.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
She used to swim a lot.	Natare multum illa solebat.
His father is there.	Pater eius ibi est.
I have heard much about this.	multa de hoc audivi.
You can only do this.	Tantum potes hoc facere.
Who said this.	Quis id dixit.
He did not seem to accept it.	Non videbatur accipere.
That's not true.	Ut non est.
The boy was looking good.	Puer autem erat vultus bonus.
He wanted more for us.	Plus nobis voluit.
You can stay home with us.	Nobiscum domi manere potes.
Yes it is what we can say.	Ita est quod possumus dicere.
Do not do this.	Noli hoc facere.
I'm just here.	Non sum sicut hic.
Close up on a lot of things.	Proxima in multum.
Great thing is going.	Magna res eat.
I can't stay here with you.	Non possum hic manere apud vos.
we are very pleased.	admodum sumus.
I can't believe	Non possum credere.
I haven't had a bad time.	Non habuit tempus malum.
Which of you was correct.	Quod ex vobis fuit verum.
It just looks good.	Hoc solum spectat bonum.
This just isn't so.	Hoc modo non ita est.
But we are together now.	Sed simul nunc sumus.
I know what I need.	Scio quid opus sit.
And probably the same.	Probabiliter et ipse.
Now that was great.	Nunc ut magna erat.
and you are.	et es.
I don't want to say anything else.	Nolo aliud dicere.
As well, nothing pleases me.	Cum bene, nihil placet.
If not what he said.	Nisi quod non dixit.
in not mentioned.	In non dictum est.
All the time indeed.	Omnia tempus quidem.
This one was for me.	Hoc unum mihi fuit.
I don't know what.	Nescio quid, ego.
He did nothing else.	Nihil aliud fecit.
You can have this one thing, man.	Unum hoc habere potes, homo.
I want to know what to do.	Scire volo quid faciam.
It was great.	Erat magna.
I don't want to help you.	Nolo te adiuvare.
You have to tell the truth.	Habes verum dicere.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
This boy was good.	Hic puer bonus erat.
It seemed not enough.	Parum videbatur.
I am sure that this is so.	Pro certo habeo hoc ita esse.
But it was the same.	Sed sed ipsum erat.
Well, at least the car was still here.	Bene, certe currus adhuc hic erat.
But not enough.	Sed non satis.
No, it was great.	Non, magna erat.
First	Primum.
That's what happened.	Id quod factum est.
He was behind her.	post eam erat.
He could not do this.	Hoc facere non potuit.
Excellent indeed.	Optime quidem.
I tried to do it badly, but I could not.	Male me facere conatus sum, nec potui.
He came home late.	Domum sero venit.
She has been there for a year now.	Ibi iam anno illa fuit.
This is it! 	Hoc est!
The best thing I can see.	Res optime videre non potest.
What you want.	Quod vis.
I wish I could do it alone.	Utinam id solum me.
But it won't be so bad for you.	Sed non ita tibi erit malum.
The boy was late in the afternoon.	Sero erat ille puer post meridiem.
But not only.	Sed non nisi.
It's not what I want.	Non est quod volo.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
I don't know what he means.	quid sibi velit nescio.
See whether it is true.	Vide an verum sit.
Things are not looking good.	Quae non sunt vultus bonum.
Go home in the morning.	Mane domum.
That was good for me.	Bene mihi illa fuit.
Probably you too.	Verisimiliter tu quoque.
Maybe it won't be bad.	Fortasse non erit malum.
He truly understood what he said.	Vere intellexit id quod dixit.
We can say nothing.	Nihil possumus dicere.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
I want to buy a house.	Domum emere volo.
He must do everything himself.	Totum ipse facere debet.
And tomorrow he will come again.	Et cras iterum venit.
But to us.	Sed ut nobis.
If anything is said, you know why.	Si quid dictum est, scis quare.
Well, it's fine.	Bene, bene est.
The day was busy.	Dies occupatus esset.
This could be the first time.	Primum id potuit.
Everything as stated.	Omnia ut dictum est.
See you through now.	Te per nunc.
You have enough time.	Satis temporis habes.
You do not want.	Non vis.
You can do whatever you need.	Facere potes quod tibi opus est.
So here.	Sic hic.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
But that's only what.	Sed id nisi quam.
He is a really good guy.	Is vere bonus guy est.
I looked like him.	Vidi sicut eum.
Hardly got it.	Vix obtinuit.
Look and see first.	Primum vide et vide.
You should not do it.	Non debes facere.
You all do it.	Vos omnes id.
But now it is not.	Sed iam non est.
I have something to do.	Facere aliquid habeo.
But he likes it himself.	Sed id ipsum velit.
And so here.	Et sic hic.
It's not a great idea.	Etiam non magna ex.
This was my first time out there.	Is mihi erat primum ex ibi.
you must go.	ire debes.
Not much next year.	Non multum proximo anno.
They are in him.	Sunt in eum.
Rightly indeed.	Recte quidem.
It was time to go.	Tempus erat ut.
The season goes well.	Tempore bene.
There was more.	Plus erat.
It is absolutely one thing.	Omnino unum est.
But not me indeed.	Sed non me quidem.
It must be better.	Necesse est ut melius.
Not yet.	Non adhuc.
That's very important.	Ut in magna ipsum.
He is a man.	Is est homo.
Well, that's all today.	Bene, id est hodie omnia.
To be well with him.	Ut bene sit cum eo.
I don't want to see this.	Nolo hoc videre.
And there was another.	Fuit autem aliud.
Make your lunch.	Fac tibi prandium.
One.	Unus.
That's what I thought was happening.	Id ita fieri putabam.
All nothing.	Omnes nihil.
This happened early in the morning.	Hoc factum est mane post mane.
He likes to be willing.	Velit velit.
I do not see.	Non video.
I know you.	Novi te.
I know nothing about him.	Nihil novi in ​​eo.
not in this way.	non hoc modo.
But for now.	Sed in nunc enim.
and it will always be.	et semper erit.
you have to stay.	habes manere.
Well done!	Bene factum!
If that's how it is, that's how it is.	Si id quomodo est, id quomodo est.
Everyone wants to talk.	Omnes loqui vult.
It is not necessary for me to speak again.	Non necesse est mihi iterum dicere.
And see me.	Et vide me.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est verum.
I wanted you.	Volui te.
But that's as important.	Ut sed magna quam.
But that is altogether true.	Sed id prorsus verum est.
You still look good.	Adhuc vide bonum.
You'll never know.	Numquam est scire.
Better yet.	Tamen non melius.
I don't know how, but it is.	nescio quomodo, sed est.
Not too soon.	Non nimis cito.
Truly it was done.	Vere factum est.
He said good.	Dixit bonum.
Not that he saw this.	Non quod hoc vidit.
Sure enough, it was done.	Certe satis, factum est.
So tell me.	Ita dic mihi.
But not you.	Sed non tu.
To have something.	Habere aliquid.
Soon there will be a boy.	Mox puer erit.
But he could not say this.	Sed hoc non potuit dicere.
He is not happy.	Felix non est.
It could be a lot of things.	Multum posset esse.
And this to say something.	Et hoc aliquid dicere.
I never met him.	Numquam ei occurrit.
There in the day.	Ibi in die.
Please don't do this now.	Quaeso ne hoc modo.
I want to say this, though.	Hoc dicere volo, sed.
Say, everyone.	Dic, omnes.
Not yet.	Nondum.
It was an easy decision.	Facile consilium fuit.
I have nothing, man.	Nihil habeo, homo.
You need to be close.	Proxima esse debes.
But you know.	Sed tu scis .
I could not get there.	Potui non ibi.
You are not right.	Non recte.
She could do a good job.	Bene facere posset officium.
Very happy to be here.	Sit amet ipsum ut hic.
even now he did not know why.	etiam nunc cur nesciebat.
There's only one problem.	Nulla tantum quaestio est.
There is.	Ibi est.
Video is not easy.	Video non facile.
You can't believe it and you don't owe it.	Non potes ei credere et non debes.
And now it seems to be done again.	Et nunc iterum fieri videtur.
I don't think it's possible at all.	Omnino puto posse.
This should be bad.	Hic mali debet esse.
It's what you want.	Est id quod vis.
That's enough.	Quod satis est.
You never have.	Numquam habes.
It was the first time.	Primum erat.
By the time	Ad tempus.
He made me think.	Ipse me fecit cogitare.
But now was the time.	Nunc sed tempus erat.
You have tried your best.	Optime conatus es.
This is certainly not going to be easy.	Hoc certe non facile futurum est.
There is no evil, no good.	Non est malum, non est bonum.
That is.	Id est.
We have a job to do.	Habemus officium facere.
As stated in the save.	Ut in dictum nisi.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
That was something.	Quod erat aliquid.
I knew you didn't have anything for me.	Sciebam non habere aliquid in me.
This is not to be done.	Hoc non est faciendum.
That was really good.	Ut vere bonus esset.
Everything will be fine.	Omnia bene esse.
Plus, not this.	Plus, non hoc.
Yes it is kind.	Ita genus est.
I see him.	Eum video.
He himself said.	Ipse dixit.
But no one knew anything about him.	Sed nemo scivit aliquid de eo facere.
Certainly not anymore.	Certe non amplius.
He left us there.	Ibi nobis reliquit.
They are still very likely.	Verisimile tamen sunt.
This is enough for me.	Hoc mihi satis est.
But probably already that too.	Sed probabiliter iam id quoque.
We can't really do much.	Non multum vere possumus.
No, not him.	Nulla non ipsum.
He saw it for the first time.	Ille primum vidit.
That's all we can do.	Id est omnes possumus.
He went, he went away.	Abiit, abiit.
That's not what I said.	Ut non dictum quam.
but for lunch.	sed ad prandium.
Don't even talk to you.	Ne loqui quidem tibi est.
I don't mean to be.	Non vult esse.
I was told I met with him.	Dictum habui cum eo.
as much as you want.	ut vis.
Nothing is important unless it is.	Nulla sit amet nisi sit.
Or it will be bad.	Vel male erit.
But there was no time.	Sed nec tempus erat.
He did this work for him.	Hoc opus sibi fecit.
We have it, and here we are.	Nos eam habemus, et hic sumus.
But it was not enough.	Sed non satis fuit.
Maybe there was something wrong with me.	Fortasse aliquid mali apud me fuit.
Everyone has to be there to know.	Habet omnes ibi scire.
That's going to be good for us.	Id bene nobis futurum est.
Not that much to me.	Nec id ad me multum.
He is the same.	Ipse est.
Nothing is important for you before.	Nulla sit amet enim ante.
He was just not ready to see.	Erat modo paratus non videre.
Maybe a year later.	Fortasse anno post.
men are men.	homines homines sunt.
I just know your name.	Modo nomen scio.
You never forgot.	Numquam oblitus es.
But tell me this.	Sed hoc dic mihi.
He has not.	non habet.
He would not want him.	Noluit eum velle.
He only said this.	Hoc tantum dixit.
No one really knows what happened.	Nemo vere scit quid acciderit.
Don't speak now.	Noli nunc dicere.
I thought you were there.	Putabam te ibi esse.
It looks pretty good.	Non satis spectat.
Who thinks this is evil?	Quis hoc malum putat?
You really don't want to know.	Vere scire non vis.
Call me if something happens.	Me si quid acciderit.
It is difficult to find.	Difficile est invenire.
I don't like it, he didn't.	Non placet, noluit.
And you are the same.	Et idem es.
I can think of so many things to do with it.	Tam multa facere cum eo cogitare possum.
It is said to know everything.	Dictum est omnia scire.
This is his plan.	Hoc eius consilium est.
That's what I wanted to do tonight.	Id hac nocte facere vellem.
Tell me if there is anything new.	Dic me si quid est novi.
Got this product.	Obtinuit hoc opus.
I heard it.	Audivi eam.
I am myself.	Ego me.
This was enough.	Hoc satis erat.
We need it.	Nobis opus est.
That hardly seems today.	Quod hodie vix videtur.
He knew what this meant.	Sciebat quid hoc esset.
He didn't even say much to me.	Non multum mihi quidem dixit.
I feel you.	Ego sentio tibi.
There are only three.	Tres sunt tantum.
I love him.	Tu illum amo.
It was like that.	Similis erat ut.
He wanted to come and go.	Venire et ire ut voluit.
He was still alive.	Adhuc erat.
He came here yesterday.	Heri huc venit.
But there was someone there.	Sed eram aliquis ibi.
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla quam.
I just said the truth.	Modo verum dixit.
I'm not doing well today.	Im 'non est bene facere hodie.
I believe this was the first one.	Primum hoc unum fuisse credo.
Tomorrow as before.	Cras ut ante.
There is no way to love yourself.	Nulla ut ipsum.
no one could know about him.	de eo nemo scire potuit.
This is exactly what comes to mind.	Ita prorsus occurrit.
He saw himself here.	Vidit hic se.
All you need to do is learn.	Omnes facere debes scire.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
But still he did it.	Sed tamen fecit.
Nothing will do it.	Nihil facturus est.
You have little to understand.	Tu parum es intelligere.
I love the book.	Librum amo.
This is similar.	Hoc simile est.
I am with you.	Ego sum apud te.
This was too much for me.	Nimium hoc mihi fuit.
You are up to him.	Se ad es.
Looks like she's talking to someone.	Spectat sicut illa loquitur ad aliquem.
He gave him the book.	Librum ei dedit.
This is not working.	Hoc non est opus.
But there was only one.	Sed non erat nisi.
This can indeed be done in this way.	Quod quidem potest hoc modo fieri.
I couldn't think of anything to say.	Non potuit cogitare aliquid dicere.
The thing is not like that.	Res non est similis esse.
What he did not know.	Quid ille nesciebat.
I really want to go with him.	Ego vere cum eo ire volo.
Maybe, maybe.	Forte, fortasse.
No one said yes.	Nemo dixit quod sic.
I was alone.	Solus eram.
Well almost nothing.	Bene fere nihil.
Too hard to help.	Etiam difficile est auxilium.
It won't be too hard.	Non erit difficile.
Nothing is wrong.	Nihil est mali.
Who was.	quis erat.
i want to talk to him.	eum loqui volo.
now I said.	nunc dixi.
he thought.	putavit.
I don't know anymore.	Nescio amplius.
Certainly there is more.	Certe plus est.
There is nothing about him.	Nihil est de illo.
There was none at all.	Nulla a erat.
That looked pretty good.	Quod satis bonum vidi.
I plan to play this year.	Ludere hoc anno cogitavi.
It was morning.	Mane erat.
My name is no longer my name.	Nomen meum iam non est nomen meum.
And he was in him.	Erat autem in eo.
All I want, please.	Volo, omnes, quaeso.
I want to see and discuss.	Volo te videre et de.
Unless they are not.	Nisi non sunt.
That was not the same.	Ut nec ipsum erat.
So it was both good and bad.	Ita tam bonum quam malum fuit.
What a journey it was.	Quod iter erat.
She must be at home.	Domi esse debet.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
There is no one from him.	Nulla a ipsum enim.
He was also in the army.	Etiam in erat erat.
It was today.	Erat hodie.
Even in regards to ex.	Etiam in ipsum ex.
He never asked her.	Nunquam eam quaesivit.
But nothing to do.	Sed nihil facere.
Now he knew why.	Nunc sciebat quare.
I'm not sure if that's what you need.	Non sum certus si id quod debes.
He had another plan.	Aliud consilium habuit.
sorry for that.	Paenitet me quod.
Something's wrong now.	Aliquid iam mali de.
You know what you mean.	Scis quid id velis.
He would not listen.	Noluit audire.
You can only do this or that here only.	Hic tantum modo hoc vel illud facere potes.
That was perhaps good.	Quod erat fortasse bonum.
Say, but.	Dic, sed.
He's got something.	Ille aliquid obtinuit.
As it was.	Ut esset.
It's time to be honest.	Aliquam sit amet tempus quam.
I thought it was time when you last met.	Cogitavi esse tempus quod tu tandem occurrit.
If possible, please.	Si fieri potest, placet.
forgot everything about it.	Oblitus est omnia de illa.
Yes this has been said before.	Etiam id dictum ante.
I need to talk to him.	Mihi opus est ei loqui.
Not for the first time.	Nec primum.
At least he thought.	Certe putabat.
We can't leave him.	Eum relinquere non possumus.
not my boy.	Non puer meus.
This is only now.	Hoc tantum modo est.
It's time for now.	Aliquam in nunc.
I want to be a guy.	Volo esse guy.
All men.	Omnes homines.
We don't have people.	Homines non habemus.
You should not do it.	Non debes facere.
He understood nothing.	Nihil intellexit.
Men do.	Homines facere.
It doesn't seem to do much.	Videtur non multum facere.
All, but all, is too much.	Omnia, sed omnia, nimium est.
I guess it could be about me.	Suspicor posse de me esse.
The teacher was there.	Ibi magister fuit.
He does well.	Bene facit.
I have done nothing wrong.	Nihil mali feci.
He said that he wanted to speak.	Dixit se velle loqui.
Yes it is for you.	Sic est tibi.
Do it as much as you can.	Id cum quantum potes.
I have for id.	Habeo pro id.
His father knew.	Pater eius sciebat.
To do something.	Facere aliquid.
I saw him here.	Eum hic vidi.
You can do the thing.	Rem facere potes.
All in all now.	Omnino nunc.
That's it for him.	Quod eum pro.
What day was it? 	Quis dies erat?
I don't think you even know that.	Non puto etiam scire.
But that's what you like.	Sed id quod libet.
That's what you said.	Id quod dixisti.
That was the reason why.	Erat cur.
Really didn't know who it was.	Vere nesciebam quis esset.
This is your school.	Haec schola tua est.
I didn't like it before.	Ut non velit ante.
And perhaps rightly so.	Et fortasse recte.
This means a lot to me.	Hoc est multum mihi.
We've been here for a long time, too long.	Hic diu, nimium diu sumus.
But nothing.	Sed nihil.
The thing is so.	Res ita sit.
I have never seen my father in this way.	Pater meus hoc modo nunquam vidi.
Nothing seemed wrong.	Nihil mali videbatur.
You want me to hurt you.	Tibi male facere vis.
not quite well.	Non satis bene.
I believe you, man.	Credo tibi, homo.
I wish he were here.	Utinam hic esset.
Maybe it's something else.	Forsitan aliud est.
we have friends.	amicos habemus.
And never to do the right thing wrong.	Et numquam recte facere malum.
It's time to save that.	Aliquam sit amet nisi quam.
I know this.	Id scio.
.	.
Now who wished he was.	Nunc quis velit erat.
He just didn't understand.	Iustus non intellexit.
Maybe he was just there.	Hoc modo forte ibi erat.
He thought he would do it.	Putabat se facturum esse.
I think it's good.	Bonum puto.
She wanted to see it, but it was too late.	Voluit ad eam, sed sero fuit.
that I would do.	id facerem.
we need help.	auxilio nobis opus est.
But to be honest it is hardly important.	Sed sit amet enim vix magna.
I have seen at least three.	Tres certe vidi.
We still do the job.	Nos tamen officium facere.
I would not go.	ire nolui.
He wanted, yes.	Voluit, Etiam.
He thought one more time.	Unum tempus putabat.
This one is good.	Hoc unum est bonum.
Maybe you should go for one.	Fortasse debet ire ad unum.
as soon as he could, he saw again.	ut primum potuit, iterum vidit.
Not that great.	Non ut magna.
He can't swim.	Natare non potest.
It will be.	Erit.
Perhaps that's still possible.	Forsitan id tamen fieri potest.
I am not a man.	Non sum homo.
So things are.	Sic res sunt.
I can't tell you to do this.	Non possum dicere tibi hoc facere.
He doesn't, he doesn't have a lot of time.	Non facit, non multum temporis habet.
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
There is no such thing except him.	Nulla id nisi ipsum.
That's his way.	Id eius modo.
Tell me what you'd like to see better.	Dic quid velis videre melius.
Yes, but that's the same.	Etiam id nisi ipsum.
Why is it so?	Cur ita sit.
Or as it seems.	Vel ut videtur.
He was not sure yet.	Ille adhuc certus non erat.
She still didn't know.	Illa adhuc nesciebat.
Both are correct.	Utrumque recte.
I have so much for you.	Tantum habeo tibi.
He was not yet ready.	Nondum paratus erat.
I hope too.	Spero quoque.
We're all there.	Omnes ibi sumus.
I saw my mom as well.	Vidi meum, ut bene.
Please don't let me talk to you, you know.	Non placet me loqui tecum, tu scis.
I do very well.	Optime facio.
No better for him.	Nec illum melius.
It was never going to happen to me.	Numquam mecum futurum.
To save on yourself.	Ut in ipsum nisi.
I don't want to live with you anymore.	Nolo amplius tecum vivere.
Not much.	Non multum.
i never wanted you.	numquam te volui.
There will be something.	Futurum esse aliquid.
And what's behind this plan? 	Et quid post hoc consilium?
But not before.	Sed non ante.
But he already knew.	Sed iam sciebat.
I hope you do.	Spero te facere.
It is fun as well.	Sit amet quam bene.
Certainly it is so.	Certe ita est.
Do you think this is necessary?	Putasne hoc opus esse?
But there was something to do.	Facere aliquid sed erat.
I think it is necessary.	Necesse puto.
Which is very certain.	Quod valde certum est.
I knew that he was.	sciebam eum esse.
Look there.	Ibi vide.
To give money.	Pecuniam dare.
I don't see how it can be done.	Non video quomodo id fieri possit.
and you owe me.	et debes.
I know that I have done it.	Scio me fecisse.
I made friends to do it.	Amicos feci facere.
Someone is talking.	Aliquis loquitur.
You'll never get him.	Numquam ut eum.
Nothing is to be done.	Nihil faciendum est.
This is very important.	Hic magna nimis.
He also knows.	Scit etiam.
Never let us down.	Numquam nos.
He went from night to day again.	De nocte in diem iterum abiit.
Are you sick?	Esne male?
I don't want anything to stop.	Nolo quicquam prohibere.
He didn't want to think about it.	Noluit de eo cogitare.
It is as stated	Est ut dictum est.
Now a lot has been said of.	Nunc sit amet dictum ex.
That doesn't surprise me.	Quod non miror.
Now ain't nothing.	Nunc non nihil.
No one knew who was behind her.	Nemo scivit qui post eam fuit.
I don't want people to do it.	Non vult me ​​homines facere.
Who before that.	Quis ante id.
what's the meaning?	Quid sibi vellet?
We can do almost nothing.	Nihil fere possumus.
Maybe it wasn't him.	Aliquam non erat ipsum.
We're also making too much money.	Etiam nimium pecuniae sumus.
Good things too.	Bona haec quoque.
Here, without me.	Hic, sine me.
Don't do it.	Noli facere.
You can't do both.	Utrumque facere non potes.
But not as he pleases.	Sed non ut velit.
Yes, but it was said.	Etiam sed dictum erat.
He was a good boy.	Bonus puer erat.
But it is something.	Sed est aliquid.
But as stated above.	Sed ut dictum est.
Which is easy to understand.	Quod facile est intelligere.
He never said anything.	Numquam aliquid dixit.
I've tried to win for a long time.	Diu vincere conatus sum.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Noluit mecum loqui.
There is no nationality.	Non est genus.
It would seem that every effort should be made to do something.	Videtur quod omnes conatus ad aliquid faciendum.
You can do it here.	Facere hic potes.
This is enough.	Hoc satis est.
It was for sure.	Erat certe.
Hardly!	Vix!.
He understood.	Intellexit.
I am sure of that.	Certus sum de illo.
Look really good.	Bonum vide rem.
Where are you.	Ubi es.
When you don't have one, you can't say you can't win.	Cum unum non habes, dicere non potes te vincere non posse.
With this they are a little late.	Cum hoc parum sero sunt.
But it ought to prevent something from happening.	Debet autem prohibere aliquid vel futurum esse.
It's probably the man.	Vir suus probabiliter.
It is true.	Verum est.
That's none of the same.	Ut id ipsum nulla.
he said well.	bene dixit.
It's not about me.	Hoc non est de me.
You don't need me.	Non opus est mihi.
We can't do it.	Non possumus facere.
He doesn't do much right now.	Non multum nunc facit.
Just why.	Mox cur.
It is mine.	Mea est.
Now is the time now, as has been said.	Nunc id tempus nunc, ut dictum est.
I don't want it.	Nolo eam.
Which is not so bad.	Quod non est ita malum.
All you need is to play it.	Omnes opus est hoc ludere.
I'm not sure what to do.	Certus sum quid facerem.
But he knew that he ought to be seen.	Sed sciebat se videri debere.
Nothing is probable.	Probabile est nihil.
There was nothing that he could do except him.	Nihil erat quod facere posset nisi eum.
just like us.	sicut nos.
I could not.	Non potui.
to be able to do it.	id facere posse.
Hardly for you.	Vix te.
That's what he wanted.	Id quod voluit.
for it was for him.	Erat enim ei.
I was busy.	Occupatus eram.
How do you know what the dog will do.	Quomodo scis quid canis facturus sit.
Both are not good.	Non est bonum utrumque.
That's a great idea.	Ut id magna est.
I do not know.	Nescio.
I wasn't doing well in school.	In schola non eram bene facere.
Well, now it's almost that way.	Bene, nunc fere hoc modo est.
It's why it's so important.	Est cur tam magna.
I'll tell him.	Dicam eum.
It's not lunch.	Non prandium est.
Something certainly doesn't surprise me.	Aliquid certe non miror.
I said she could not.	Posset non dixi.
We are one.	Nos unum sumus.
Maybe it's so hard.	Forsitan ita difficile est.
It's good to have a car again.	Bonum est iterum habere currus.
But that is for you.	Sed id est enim.
Or it may be the same.	Vel id ipsum ut.
Do not speak to him.	Noli ei loqui.
You do everything for me.	Tu mihi omnia fac.
I know what to do.	Scio quid faciam.
I can't do it with that guy.	Non possum facere cum illo guy.
It's his plan.	Eius consilium est.
Even from rather than from.	Etiam a quam ex.
It's something that hasn't been done.	Est aliquid quod non factum est.
He really wanted nothing to win.	Quod vere vincere nihil voluit.
It is so good.	Ita bonum est.
Why did he come?	Cur venire fecit?
I need you.	Opus est tibi.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
It is.	Sic est.
and no one knows where he is.	et nemo scit ubi sit.
We can do both.	Utrumque possumus.
That's never good.	Numquam id bonum.
That's who he was.	Ut quis ipsum erat.
It was not so at all.	Sic omnino non erat.
I just don't want to get sick.	Modo nolo ut male.
But it doesn't look good.	Sed non spectat bonum.
He ate quickly.	Cito comedit.
Ut	Ut
To wish or say.	Ut vel dictum velit.
Which can be true.	Quod verum esse potest.
He is in himself.	Ipse in se.
not a lot of time.	Non multum temporis.
I don't really talk.	Non vere loqui.
which I never knew.	quod numquam sciebam.
Please do whatever you can.	Quaeso fac quod potes.
Money does not come.	Pecuniam non venit.
Tell us.	Dic nobis.
It is good.	Bonum est.
That was the name.	Id nomen erat.
We are not there.	Ibi non sumus.
But there was something more which he wanted.	Sed plus aliquid erat quod voluit.
And indeed so.	Et quidem ita.
If it is difficult, you can do something else.	Si difficile est, aliud facere potes.
But truly.	Sed vere.
I just couldn't get it anymore.	Modo non potuit eam posse.
And the man went home.	Et abiit vir in domum suam.
Or something like that.	Vel aliquid ut.
He told you what you should do.	Dixit tibi quid facias.
That's what he has.	Id quod habet.
Nothing is here for me.	Nihil hic mihi est.
It was only the first time.	Tantum primum factum est.
i love it a lot.	quod multum amo.
I don't.	Non facio.
He was really happy that night.	Is vere felix illa nocte fuit.
This trip is a good way to go.	Hoc iter est bene iter.
I have seen it.	Vidi eam.
Not in this.	Non in hoc.
This is more than that.	Hoc est quam illud.
But no one could tell me what it was.	Sed nemo mihi posset dicere quid esset.
I don't know how this work is.	Nescio quomodo hoc opus sit.
He was not home often at night.	Saepe nocte domi non erat.
Always save money.	Semper pecuniam.
That is not a thing.	Quod non sit aliquid.
I do not have.	Non habeo.
He could not believe it enough.	Non potuit satis credere.
And me.	Et me.
But even if he wants.	Sed vel nisi velit.
If not for you.	Nisi tibi.
But not the time before.	Sed non tempus ante.
He has nothing against me.	Nihil me habet.
I'm glad that it was done.	Gaudeo id quod factum est.
Its not like that.	Eius non placet.
Which is not good.	Quae non.
I have nothing.	Nihil habeo.
It has to stay that way.	Hoc habet manere illuc.
We thought to be friends.	Putavit nos esse amicos.
I am the one who loves me.	Ego sum qui amat.
This was mine.	Hic fuit meus.
My boy.	Meus puer.
And we can do that here.	Quod hic quoque facere possumus.
I just didn't want to look bad.	Modo noluit videre malum.
What to think.	Quid cogitare.
But this will be good.	Sed hoc erit bonum.
Still.	Adhuc.
That she did.	Id fecit.
you must be too.	nimium esse debes.
I guess you're going to do it.	Suspicor te facturum esse.
They are what they are and will be.	Sunt quod sunt et futurum esse.
Always in it.	Semper in eam.
I've never done it.	Nunquam feci.
He may know himself, but not speak.	Se scire potest, sed non loqui.
I wish I could help.	Utinam posset me adiuvare.
Again he said.	Iterum dixit.
He has no friends to talk to.	Amicos loqui non habet.
You have me there.	Habes me ibi.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
If he did.	Si fecerit.
but he knew everything.	sed omnia scivit.
I must do this.	Hoc mihi faciendum est.
This is very good.	Hoc est ipsum bonum.
He wanted to travel.	Iter facere vellet.
It could go either way.	Posset ire vel illuc.
There was no one who was none.	Nulla quis nulla erat.
It looks at me like this.	Ita me spectat.
Well, now.	Bene, iam.
Certainly it was not for me.	Mihi certe non fuit.
It was too much for me.	Nimium mihi fuit.
To stop.	Prohibere.
As you said, so is the case.	Sicut dixisti, ita se res habet.
He knows and yet does not.	Scit et tamen non facit.
I was ready.	paratus eram.
I did not know there until after it had been done.	ibi nesciebam nisi post factum.
Or in a matter.	Vel in rem.
There is one thing.	Unum est.
Don't play with me.	Noli me ludere.
I will do the same for you.	Idem faciam tibi.
He got it to do with it.	Qui cum id facere obtinuit.
but he always knew.	sed semper sciebat.
There was nothing but to know.	Nihil erat nisi scire.
Please do this.	Quaeso hoc.
So do it again.	Sic fac iterum.
He still does this.	Adhuc hoc facit.
I wish I had never wished.	Utinam numquam velit.
I don't know how to say it.	Nescio quomodo dicam.
I thought about everything.	Cogitavi omnia.
Here, here, here I saw.	Hic, hic, hic vidi.
he did, and saw nothing.	fecit, et nihil vidit.
Yes, or it was him.	Etiam vel erat ipsum.
No he was not.	Nulla non erat.
I don't want to talk about this.	De hoc loqui nolo.
there was a need.	opus erat.
It was not good.	Non erat bonum.
To leave.	Relinquere.
It is the best option.	Optime bene sit.
I know you.	Scio te.
I thought maybe it's too hard to find me.	Putavi fortasse difficile invenire me.
It has been a long time.	Diu fuit.
This is certainly true.	Hoc certe verum est.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
You do your job.	Tuum fac tibi.
I don't know how to say anything else.	Nescio quomodo aliud dicam.
He left for work in the morning.	Mane opus reliquit.
Mine.	Meus.
but I feel this way.	hoc tamen modo sentio.
What advice could you give?	Quod consilium dare posset?
Never let him down, no one is there.	Numquam illum, nulla quis sit.
Got it, got it.	Obtinuit, obtinuit.
And it was great.	Erat et magna.
I just couldn't help. 	Modo non potuit adiuvare. 
Look at this for yourself.	Hoc tibi vide.
He made certain.	Certum fecit.
It doesn't feel like home.	Hoc non placet domi.
He was certainly not alone.	Solus certe non erat.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
I feel very lucky to have that.	Quod sentio valde felix habere.
This is not bad at all.	Non est omnino malum hoc.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
Say just what you want.	Dic modo quod vis.
We have the money to do it.	Nos pecuniam ad faciendum est.
Pretty much always.	Satis multa semper.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
This is difficult to understand.	Hoc difficile est intelligere.
I am not a father.	Non sum pater.
Don't be what you are not.	Noli esse quod non es.
Thus he says.	Ita dicit.
Never or anyone.	Numquam vel quis.
If someone.	Si quis.
It is important he was out.	Aliquam sit amet erat ex.
There is!	Ibi est!
I hope to see you soon.	Spero videre te mox.
You know what is to be done.	Scis quid faciendum sit.
but it is too late.	sed sero est.
We're not here long.	Non diu hic sumus.
There was no need for me to do tonight.	Nihil opus erat me hac nocte facere.
This is easy.	Hoc est facile.
We need your help.	Auxilium tuum nobis opus est.
It really got him.	Is vere obtinuit eum.
I heard it.	Audivi eam.
you must leave.	relinquere debes.
I heard it.	Audivi eam.
Really evil is evil.	Vere malum est malum.
Tell me what you mean and why.	Dic mihi quid sit tibi et quare.
But it is not evil.	Sed non est malum.
For he was with us.	Erat enim nobis.
He could not go.	Ire potuit.
Why so?	Cur ita?
But not for it.	Sed non enim.
Genus a.	Genus a.
He looked well.	Vidit bene.
He could not get any.	Posse quam nec aliquam.
I knew what he meant.	Sciebam quid vellet.
I never wanted to be.	Numquam volui esse.
But there was also nothing.	Sed et erat nisi.
But these things are correct.	Sed haec bene sunt.
This is not true.	Hoc non est.
It was a bad time.	In tempore mali erat.
That's not always how.	Ut non semper quam.
I heard yesterday yesterday.	heri me heri audivi.
No it wasn't great.	Nulla non erat magna.
He is a good dog.	Canis bonus est.
But better late than never.	Sed melius sero quam numquam.
He likes to talk.	Loqui vult.
But there is a lot to be done.	Sed sit amet est.
I have a lot.	Multum habeo.
You don't need either of these.	Utrumque non opus est.
never married.	numquam uxorem habuit.
Or a day.	Vel dies.
It was an easy decision.	Facile consilium fuit.
My husband	Vir meus.
see and see.	vide et vide.
We have enough money to travel now.	Satis pecuniae ad iter nunc habemus.
But that is good.	Sed id bonum est.
You can think what's wrong with it.	Potes cogitare quid mali facturus sit.
He was not where he was.	Non erat ubi esset.
Maybe he's there now.	Ibi fortasse nunc est.
Do it for sure.	Fac certe.
I've never done that.	Ego quod nunquam feci.
I tried to be.	Conatus esse.
This he does well.	Hoc bene facit.
Not so well.	Non ita bene.
I need to do this.	Hoc mihi opus est facere.
I tried to tell you.	Conatus sum tibi dicere.
I am not surprised at this, but I am surprised.	Hoc non miror, sed miror.
He told me something.	Dixit mihi aliquid.
Probably both occurred.	Verisimiliter utrumque occurrit.
But it is not enough.	Sed non satis est.
That which has never been done nor can be done.	Quod numquam factum est nec potest.
is very busy.	Is est valde occupatus.
There was so much else to do.	Tantum erat aliud facere.
I don't even know what that is.	Nescio quidem quid id sit.
I never saw this guy again.	Numquam hoc guy iterum vidi.
He did not like him.	Nolebat eum.
And now all.	Et nunc totum.
Maybe you need to.	Fortasse debes.
But not yet.	Sed ne adhuc.
He already knew.	Iam sciebat.
You must win.	Et vincere necesse est.
I can't see it too well.	Non possum videre eam nimium bene.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
perhaps not.	fortasse non.
I'm sorry either way.	Utrumque me paenitet.
He can never talk to me again.	Numquam iterum mecum loqui potest.
The day is not too good.	Dies non nimium bene.
I could not go home.	Domum ire non potui.
You are.	Tu es.
This is my man.	Hic est homo meus.
If anything appears, it is probable.	Si quid videtur, verisimile est.
Thus he does.	Sic facit.
Everything is in your hands.	Omnia in tua.
This has been done.	Hoc factum est.
It's too soon.	Nimis cito est.
Just.	Iustus .
I didn't think it was enough.	Non satis putavi.
He never wants him.	Eum numquam velit.
I know I'm going to do great things.	Scio me magna facturum esse.
Who is it possible?	Qui fieri potest?
He's gonna have some fun with that.	Amet amet aliquam cum.
I was great, too.	Fui magna, etiam.
Not well.	Non bene.
I don't have time for that.	Non tempus illud.
Maybe somebody is nothing.	Aliquam quis est nisi.
I have the same thing.	Ego idem habeo.
Even if he wants to do so.	Etiam id nisi velit.
This is totally different.	Hoc est prorsus aliud.
Please don't get me wrong.	Quaeso ne me male.
But it was not him.	Sed non erat ipsum.
.	.
So I will do that today.	Ita faciam ut hodie.
And now he has done this.	Et nunc hoc fecit.
This is not difficult.	Hoc difficile non est.
Nothing is better, for sure.	Nihil melius, certe.
Well we're out of time.	Bene sumus ex tempore.
I really tried to think about it.	Ego vere conatus est cogitare de illo.
He can tell the story.	Rem narrare potest.
I thought so much.	Cogitavi tantum.
There is no id.	Nulla id.
If you do not want, you will not.	Si non vis, non vis.
You don't need anything else.	Non opus est tibi aliud.
It's time to say great things.	Aliquam ut dictum magna.
I don't have money.	Pecuniam non habeo.
This is similar.	Hoc simile est.
It is time!	Tempus est!
It could be great.	Posset magna.
I can't tell you anything else.	Non possum tibi aliud dicere.
That's the same thing for me.	Id ipsum mihi.
All at once.	Omnia simul.
and i did.	et feci.
Much time this way.	Multo tempore hoc modo.
What need is there? 	Quid eo opus est?
.	.
He was the same.	Ipsum erat.
Yes that's how it was.	Etiam id quam erat.
I said I myself.	Dixi ego ipse.
It was time for some.	Aliquam a tempus erat.
He likes to be himself.	Velit ut ipsum.
don't like me.	Non placet me.
But that is how.	Sed id est quam.
You are still here now.	Tu tamen hic nunc es.
All this has been said.	Hoc totum dictum est.
I have never seen anyone before.	Numquam ante quis.
No, that's not enough.	Non, id parum est.
It is good.	Bonum sit.
I will definitely do it again.	Certum iterum faciam.
When do you want this?	Quando hoc vis?
I know you have.	Scio te habere.
It certainly should.	Is certe debet.
It could be here too.	Posset hic quoque.
But no one knew what to do.	Sed nemo scivit quid sibi faciendum sit.
Leave people alone alone.	Solum homines solum relinquere.
But time is too late.	Sed tempus est nimis sero.
I would be interested to think about it.	Ut sit amet cogitare de illo.
Great things will happen soon here.	Magna mox hic verum futurum est.
Certainly well.	Certe bene.
This is mine.	Hoc meum est.
he said it was going to be too much time.	dixit nimium tempus futurum.
I even go to school.	Ego quidem ad scholam.
No one now knows why he did it.	Cur id fecerit, nemo nunc scit.
But here was something.	Sed hic, aliquid erat.
it was hard for him too.	difficile erat ei quoque.
You want to know.	Vis scire.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
That's a great idea.	Ut dictum magna.
But so is the man.	Sed ita homo.
We can't do it yet.	Id tamen facere non possumus.
It could even be you.	Posset vel esse te.
His work has been done.	Suum opus factum est.
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
But it is so.	Sed ita est.
That is not the same.	Quod ipsum non est.
If you like, great.	Si placet, magna.
For he was.	Erat enim.
But here.	Hic sed.
There is something to say.	Aliquid dicere est.
But that is not going to happen.	Sed id non est futurum.
Not much with us.	Non multum apud nos.
Looks like this day.	Similis hic dies.
Yes that is great.	Etiam id magna est.
I '.	EGO '.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
it is certain.	certum est.
The boy before.	Puer ante.
You can't think.	Non potes cogitare.
I am very glad to say that we are now.	Valde gaudeo dicere quod nunc sumus.
And no one knows why.	Et nemo scit quare.
Man knows what he knows.	Homo scit quae scit.
That was not great.	Ut non erat magna.
Hardly from me.	Vix a me.
All these things are important to me.	Quae omnia mihi magna sunt.
They never asked him.	Nunquam eum quaesivit.
yes or is that.	Etiam vel est quam.
He comes to me.	Venit ad me.
I like everything.	Mihi placet omnibus.
I told you before.	Ante dixi tibi.
At that time I was a boy.	Eo tempore puer fui.
Both are correct.	Utrumque recte.
This is not enough for me.	Hoc mihi parum.
That's a great idea.	Ut id magna est.
There was nothing new.	Nihil erat novi.
Something must be done.	Aliquid faciendum est.
I think it's such a good job.	Puto suus officium tam bonum.
Again the same thing happened.	Iterum simile factum est.
At least tonight.	Certe hac nocte.
I know not to be.	Scio non esse.
But that's only great.	Sed id nisi magna.
That's how it can be done.	Id quomodo fieri possit.
I didn't know you could do this.	Nesciebam te hoc facere posse.
Which is true.	Quod verum est.
I don't believe you could.	Non credo posse.
he says.	dicit.
I didn't want to be there anymore.	Nolui esse amplius.
Please also be honest.	Etiam sit amet dictum velit.
Do as good as you can.	Fac ut bonum quod potes.
It was not hard.	Non erat difficile.
There is none in this.	Nulla in hoc est.
He was kind.	Genus erat.
He still didn't know why he asked.	Adhuc nesciebat quare quaesivit.
Don't buy.	Noli emere.
He doesn't have a dog.	Canem non habet.
If they are great.	Si sunt, magna.
This cannot be done correctly.	Hoc recte fieri non potest.
I could not do anything.	Non potui aliquid facere.
Now but no.	Nunc sed nulla.
should i know.	scio debet.
What's the purpose of that.	Quid ad illud.
I saw him do it.	Eum facere vidi.
So she started her business.	Sic incepit eam rem.
Maybe there.	Ibi forte.
I can't talk for too long.	Nimis diu loqui non possum.
I don't think anything.	Non aliquid cogitare.
This thing he did.	Quae res ita fecit.
It was certain that she was.	Certum erat eam esse.
We are on time.	Nos ex tempore sumus.
To help someone be honest.	Ad auxilium aliquis amet sit amet.
Who can help me?	Quis me potest adiuvare?
I want you to talk with us.	Volo te nobiscum loqui.
Nothing does not mean to be done.	Nihil non vult fieri.
He began to say something, but did not.	Incepit aliquid dicere, sed non fecit.
He refused to call me.	Noluit me dicere.
Nor can I.	Nec possum.
No one is quite sure how much to believe.	Nemo satis certus est quantum credere.
He knew that it was time for something else.	Aliud sciebat quod tempus esset.
I don't know his name yet.	Nondum nomen eius nescio.
Not well.	Non bene.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
It will be fine.	Bene erit.
All, all my love.	Omnes, omnia mea.
He asked about you.	Quaesivit de te.
There will be no need.	Non opus erit.
This is something to give.	Hoc est aliquid dare.
But without time, that is nothing.	Sed sine tempore, id est nihil.
So the man said to me.	Sic mihi homo dixit.
This one is for all.	Hoc unum est omnibus.
I need you.	Opus est tibi.
He said that this could not be true.	Dixit hoc verum esse non posse.
But nothing was ever like.	Sed nihil umquam simile.
This really doesn't work.	Hoc vere non opus est.
It's at home.	Est domi.
When are you with me?	Cum me es?.
I don't want to talk to you.	Nolo loqui tibi.
Can not.	Non potest.
But he was also himself.	Sed et ipsum erat.
See you tonight.	Vide te hac nocte.
He went home.	Abiit domum.
It was behind me.	Post me fuit.
Now is not the time to save.	Nunc nec tempus nisi.
It's time to get away from nothing.	Aliquam a nulla quam.
Totally up to you.	Prorsus ad vos.
Perhaps he saw, perhaps he did not.	Fortasse vidit, fortasse non fecit.
yes it is not said.	Etiam non dictum est.
He didn't think so.	Non putabat.
Maybe not a great time.	Aliquam non tempus magna.
I don't want to stay here.	Hic manere nolo.
Thus we are.	Sic nos.
It's better not to think too much about it.	Melius est ne de hoc nimium cogitare.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
It is a great story.	Aliquam magna est.
Now and always.	Nunc et semper.
It was a good decision.	Bonum consilium fuit.
Why don't you want me?	Cur non vis?
He himself said.	Ipse dixit.
what I have seen.	quod vidi.
He did not think so.	Nec putabat.
But he gave nothing.	Sed nihil dedit.
This does nothing.	Hoc nihil facit.
I can't seem to see him.	Non possum videri illum videri.
Yes that's no save.	Etiam id nulla nisi.
You know you want one.	Scis te unum velle.
But never great.	Sed numquam magna.
But what if.	Sed quid si.
It will never be like this.	Numquam sic erit.
We can travel.	Iter facere possumus.
But I'm afraid.	Vereor tamen.
But here is not why we are here.	Sed hic non est cur hic sumus.
Exactly as.	Prorsus ut.
It was my face.	Meus erat vultus.
This is not possible.	Hoc fieri non potest.
He never does.	Numquam facit.
No more than that.	Nulla id quam.
Too much time.	Nimis multa simul.
never say anything to him.	numquam aliquid ei.
I don't have money.	Pecuniam non habeo.
This is not a problem yet.	Hoc non est quaestio, sed.
It was time.	Tempus erat.
I've never been in there before either.	Numquam in nulla ante vel.
Nothing here, nothing.	Nihil hic, nihil.
I've seen one before.	Ego vidi unum ante.
I never knew what to say.	Numquam sciebam quid dicam.
School at night.	Schola nocte.
I'll tell you now.	Dicam nunc.
As always was.	Ut semper erat.
I know what to do.	Scio quid faciam.
i can really.	vere possum.
If everything.	Omnia si.
You don't need me.	Non opus est mihi.
I hope it will be.	Spero fore.
Now is the time for me to speak.	Nunc tempus est mihi dicere.
I'm not so sure.	Non sum tam certus.
I don't doubt you have anything to say.	Non dubito tibi aliquid dicere.
I know my nationality.	Scio meum genus.
It was hardly enough.	Vix satis erat.
Probably not here.	Verisimile non est hic.
Has to be on time.	Habet esse in tempore.
I can't do this.	Non possum hoc facere.
yes you do.	Etiam tu facis.
That is possible.	Quod fieri potest.
It is certain.	Certum est.
What ought not to be done is necessary.	Quod fieri non debet necesse est.
Don't do it again.	Ne id iterum.
I don't know what's happened tonight.	Quid hac nocte acciderit nescio.
What one wants.	Quod quis velit.
But that was it.	Sed id erat.
We cannot do this.	Hoc facere non possumus.
You don't have to travel.	Non habes iter.
It is.	Est.
which means you.	quam modo te.
We can say this.	Dicere possumus id.
Or it was true.	Vel erat verum.
You don't have a thing.	Rem non habes.
What is.	Quid est.
So got the job.	Ita officium obtinuit.
he did not say where.	non dixit ubi.
It's up to you.	Sic est ad vos.
We've already bought it.	Nos iam id emit.
I want to know.	Scire volo.
That is very good.	Quod valde bonum est.
This has just recently happened.	Hoc modo nuper factum est.
But who wants to say	Sed quis dictum velit.
You know what you think you're up to.	Scire te putas quid usque ad es.
He was just a guy.	Iustus erat guy.
There was something new.	Aliquid novi fuit.
It is certain that I am.	Certum est me esse.
There is a lot of work to be done here.	Multum hic opus faciendum est.
I don't think it was okay.	Et non puto bene factum esse.
You think nothing.	Nihil cogitas.
I could not understand what had just happened.	Non potuit intelligere quid nuper factum esset.
That is enough.	Quod satis sit.
That was what happened to him.	Id erat quod acciderit.
This again looks good.	Hoc iterum spectat bonum.
It is necessary to stay together.	Simul manere necesse est.
I can't think for all.	Non possum pro omnibus cogitare.
not better.	Non melius.
Please go.	Ire velit.
That is possible.	Quod fieri potest.
That's not zero.	Ut non est nulla.
Maybe it was time.	Fortasse id tempus erat.
My father was in him.	Pater meus in eo erat.
He understood also.	Intellexit etiam.
He is not talking much.	Is non multum loquitur.
It is so much different.	Tantum est aliud.
And yet a little later, there he is.	Et tamen paulo post, ibi est.
It doesn't stay really long.	Non diu vere manere.
This has not been done for a long time.	Non diu hic factum est.
He did so much for me.	Tantum fecit mihi.
Stay here if you want.	Mane hic si vis.
You want something better.	Melius aliquid vis.
Can someone please help me do this very well.	Potest aliquis quaeso mihi id optime facere.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
He has to leave us.	Ille nos relinquere habet.
At first it was not bad.	Primum malum non fuit.
I did not know.	nesciebam.
I knew it would be okay.	Sciebam fore bene.
He wanted you.	Voluit te.
But it can be late.	Sed potest esse sero.
I don't know anything more.	Nescio, plus aliquid.
This is the first time.	Hoc est primum.
No one knows nothing.	Nemo nihil scit.
You need to do it.	Opus est ut facias.
This was what he did.	Hoc erat quod fecit.
This was evil.	Hoc malum fuit.
He already has for you.	Iam pro te habet.
I love this post.	Post hoc amo.
Tomorrow something will happen.	Cras aliquid futurum.
and your dog.	et canem tuum.
I already have the money.	Iam pecuniam habeo.
He wanted to stay and talk.	Quod voluit manere et loqui.
If this were so, it would be true.	Quod si ita esset, verum esset.
Which is true.	Quod verum est.
It's almost like there.	Fere similis est ibi.
That's what he wanted.	Id voluit.
I can only receive.	Nihil possum nisi accipere.
Now it's completely wrong.	Nunc est omnino malum.
You can do exactly that too.	Prorsus id etiam facere potes.
He didn't do it.	Non faceret.
This could not have been done again.	Hoc iterum fieri non potuit.
Things like .	Res sicut .
If you do, this is for you.	Si feceris, hoc tibi.
When he began, no one thought he could stop him.	Cum incepit, nemo eum prohibere posse putabat.
I already know who it is.	Jam scio quis sit.
No one can speak.	Nemo potest dicere.
But that is not what he wants to hear.	Sed non est quod audire vult.
It was something else.	Aliud fuit.
I could not know what it was.	Non potui quid esset.
He went to school.	Ad scholam venit.
I could understand everything.	Omnia intelligere potui.
This has been enough.	Hoc satis dictum est.
It is not probable.	Probabile non est.
he is still here.	adhuc hic est.
It is one day.	Dies unus est.
We want three.	Nos tres volo.
It's somebody to do so.	Est quis id.
You can't love yours, but not mine.	Non potes amo tuum, sed non meum.
We will definitely stay again.	Nos certe manere iterum.
That's yours.	Sic tua.
Someone was at home.	Aliquis domi erat.
It probably wasn't good.	Probabile fuit bonum.
I need to see my dad.	Pater meus opus est videre.
Last week, perhaps.	Septimana, fortasse.
I'm not sure.	Im 'certus non sum.
I can't do this alone.	Hoc solum facere non possum.
She was thinking that way too.	Illa quoque modo illa putabat.
The day after us is nothing.	dies post nos nihil est.
I didn't want one.	Nolui unum.
I've been through the years.	Fui per annos.
Someone like that.	Aliquis ut.
Don't get sick.	Non male.
I just did it.	Modo id feci.
One does not know.	Unus non scit .
Not long yet.	Non diu tamen.
Please make yourself at home.	Quaeso te domi fac.
A little later, why he saw it.	Paulo post, cur vidit.
It was not until now.	Nunc nec erat quam.
Not sure whether it is good or bad.	Non certus utrum bonum vel malum sit.
Not sure if there is much.	Non certe, si multum est.
Too much has been said about.	Nimis dictum fere.
What if	Quid si .
As stated above.	Sicut dictum est.
You should not be alone.	Solus non debes.
But time is enough to say.	Sed tempus est satis dicere.
Nothing like this.	Nihil hic simile.
But they are not the same.	Sed non sunt idem.
Nothing else could he do.	Nihil aliud facere potuit.
He wants you to live one day at a time.	Te unum diem ad tempus vivere vult.
I didn't say which one.	Non dicam quod unum.
and so it is.	et sic est.
It was truly kind.	Vere genus fuit.
Maybe that's great.	Aliquam id magna est.
He wanted to hear from you.	Audire te voluit.
but it is difficult for him to be with us.	sed difficile est ei nobiscum esse.
and never will.	et numquam erit.
We have everything we need here.	Nos omnia hic opus habemus.
I've thought of this before too.	Ego quoque hoc ante cogitavi.
Looks very good.	Valde bonus vultus.
But perhaps	Sed fortasse.
Not this boy.	Non hic puer.
You do your job.	Tuum hoc facis.
Some great, some not.	Aliquam magna, aliquam non.
He saw something.	Vidit aliquid.
This cannot be true.	Hoc verum esse non potest.
but he said.	sed dixit.
I choose your job.	Libet officium tuum.
it was still good.	adhuc bona erat.
There is no time except this.	Nulla id tempus nisi.
He spoke thus.	Sic dixit.
You are not right.	Non recte.
perhaps it was.	fortasse fuit.
I don't think it was.	Puto quod non erat.
He would not do this.	Hoc facere noluit.
Too much is too much.	Nimis nimis est.
He gave us something to talk about.	Dedit nobis aliquid loqui.
Don't say anything.	Noli dicere.
Maybe it was him.	Aliquam erat ipsum.
This is really bad.	Hoc vere malum est.
This was	Hoc erat.
i am no longer anything.	iam non sum quicquam.
I've done a good job.	Ego feci bonum officium.
Not that it ever was.	Non quod umquam.
But this is no longer true.	Sed hoc amplius non est.
I do not know.	Nescio.
Not well.	Non bene.
People need to know what's happened.	Homines scire opus est quid acciderit.
That's not always possible.	Quod non semper fieri potest.
The matter was not so.	Ita res non esset.
In that moment now.	In id nunc nunc.
I knew what I was going to do.	Sciebam quid facturus esset.
Not as easy as you think.	Non tam facile quam tu putas.
That was really bad.	Quod vere malum esset.
He has something to give, and to give quickly.	Aliquid habet dare, et cito dare.
I don't travel.	Non iter.
I don't know whether it can even be done.	Nescio an id etiam fieri possit.
You do what I told you.	Facis quod tibi dixi.
I could not stop.	Non potui prohibere.
Which is not true.	Quod non est verum.
I wished to go thither also.	illuc quoque ire volui.
The job has been done.	Factum est officium.
I can't go home.	Domum ire non possum.
You have done well.	Bene fecisti.
He was unable to do so.	Parum id facere potuit.
I could not leave.	relinquere potui.
It's been good.	Suus 'bonus esse.
He even attempted it.	Ille quidem conatus est.
But this is so.	Sed hoc ita est.
I like it very much.	Mihi valde placet.
he thought.	putavit.
It's time for someone new.	Tempus est aliquem novi.
We can't do it.	Non possumus facere.
That's what he was doing.	Id faceret.
never forgot.	Numquam oblitus est.
As you can see	Ut videre potes .
Now that was none.	Nunc ut erat nulla.
It's never enough.	Nunquam satis est.
Maybe he does.	Fortasse facit.
There was nothing that was seen.	Nihil erat quod videbatur.
Yes, there was not any.	Etiam non aliquam erat.
This is not easy, but possible.	Hoc non facile, sed fieri potest.
It's only something.	Est aliquid nisi.
He wants you to say everything about him.	Ipse te de eo omnia dicere vult.
He could do it all.	Potuit omnibus.
Even if you don't have.	Etiam si non habemus.
but they are good.	sed bona sunt.
But here we are.	Sed hic sumus.
Yes, he's more than me.	Etiam, ipsum quam me.
It's too late as you said.	Sero ut dixisti.
It is important to be great.	Aliquam sit amet magna.
Mine don't look.	Meus non vide.
He wants to see him.	Vult eum videre.
There's nothing great.	Nulla in magna.
Now she is gone too.	Nunc nimis abiit.
I just want to be alone today.	Ego iustus volo esse solus, hodie.
i want to work.	opus esse volo.
Yes they are.	Ita sunt.
That's not how it was.	Ut nec quam erat.
There was none.	Nemo erat.
I will not say.	Non dicam.
As it was before.	Ut non erat ante.
It was true.	Verum erat.
Do what he says.	Fac quod dicit.
He knows how.	Scit quomodo.
I would not hear any more.	Nolui amplius audire.
No no, no.	Non non, non.
Almost but not enough.	Fere sed non satis.
He has no time.	Tempus non habet.
It was always, and probably always will be.	Sic semper fuit, et probabiliter semper erit.
But I have not said great things.	Sed non dictum magna.
I want more.	Volo plus.
That's what I've done before.	Id quod ante feci.
I can say one thing, do another.	Non possum aliud dicere, aliud facere.
This I know, this you know.	Hoc scio, hoc scis.
Him!' 	Illum!'
he said.	dixit.
This one does the job.	Hoc unum facit officium.
I might as well.	Essem etiam.
Maybe that's a great idea.	Aliquam id dictum magna.
My advice	Consilium meum .
he was a boy, and he was well.	puer erat, et bene erat.
day in the morning.	Dies mane.
Well, it's fine.	Bene, bene est.
Thus it can be seen.	Sic videri potest.
I'm happy about it.	gaudeo de illo.
I don't even know you.	Non novi te quidem.
She looks at it	Et spectat eam
You can trust us.	Credere potes nobis.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
It has always been said.	Etiam semper dictum est.
Maybe a journey, but that's another story.	Iter fortasse, sed illud aliud.
This means not.	Hoc modo non est.
Yes it is true.	Etiam verum est.
Yes i just need to do it.	Sic ego iustus opus facere.
I know it's true.	Scio verum esse.
As it was on time.	Sicut erat in tempore.
Well, not always.	Bene, non semper.
Something like that.	Aliquid simile quod.
No one wanted to talk to me anymore.	Nemo mecum amplius loqui voluit.
This cannot be.	Hoc non potest esse.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
You don't have to say.	Non habes dicere.
he did well.	bene fecit.
But it is very difficult to find.	Sed valde difficile est invenire.
Again it's not.	Iterum suus.
But all at once.	Sed omnes simul.
This makes me scared.	Hoc me vix.
Now more than ever.	Nunc semper quam.
Maybe nothing here.	Nihil hic fortasse.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
I never really was home.	Numquam vere domi fuit.
He is a good boy, but also likes to speak.	Bonus puer est, sed loqui etiam vult.
I need to go to school.	Mihi opus est ad scholam ire.
But it is great.	Sed magna est.
I have to play.	Ludere habeo.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum ex.
I have this house for you.	Hanc ego domum tibi.
But as was said.	Sed ut dictum erat.
But neither was there any.	Sed nec aliquam erat.
It's that time.	Est id tempus.
I don't know where to post it.	Nescio ubi post eam.
He does good work.	Bonum opus facit.
There is no need to do this.	Non opus est hoc facere.
I do not have.	Non habeo.
No one told me how to do it.	Nemo mihi dixit quomodo id faciam.
It seems evil, and it is evil.	Malum videtur, et est malum.
No one can be certain.	Certum esse nemo potest.
This is a really good plan.	Hoc vere bonum consilium est.
Now you're finally here.	Nunc tandem hic sis.
This is not something bad or bad.	Hoc non est aliquid mali vel mali.
I just don't know what to do.	Modo nescio quid facere.
Well, so far.	Bene, quantum.
All this was.	Totum hoc fuit.
But only to us.	Sed non nisi nobis.
Got what he wanted.	Quod voluit obtinuit.
So it is.	Ita est.
He came and went.	Venit, et abiit.
No more.	Non amplius.
I didn't do anything else.	Aliud non feci.
To say this before.	Ut id ante.
But he was not there.	Sed non erat enim.
Three in the morning.	Tres mane.
He was not sure what he wanted to do.	Quid agere vellet, non erat certus.
He could not stop.	Non potuit prohibere.
I did something.	Aliquid feci.
Maybe.	Forsitan.
It was not the first time.	Primum non fuit.
I didn't want to know if I could do it.	Nolui scire si id facere posset.
Certainly it could be done.	Fieri certe potuit.
This could not be possible now.	Hoc esse modo non posset.
Unless someone does it.	Nisi quis id.
You know you have a date.	Scis te habere diem.
See, don't speak.	Vide, noli loqui.
Or he speaks.	Vel loquitur.
That never happened.	Quod nunquam factum est.
For it was.	Fuit enim.
I would not believe.	Nolui credere.
The effort is not enough.	Conatus satis est.
He knew for sure.	Scivit certe.
But that was before.	Sed id ante erat.
I am not 'after'.	non sum 'post'.
It's getting late.	Sero suus questus est.
I help you.	Ego tibi.
Please try again later.	Aliquam a dictum est.
Yes, but he wants to say.	Etiam sed dictum velit.
He went home.	Abiit domum.
This is not a problem.	Hoc non est quaestio.
and started looking.	& vultus incepit.
I know you still need to get everything in.	Scio adhuc opus esse ut omnia in.
I don't like it very much.	Id mihi non valde placet.
But it is up to you.	Sed ad te est.
Always and always.	Semper et semper.
Well, not today.	Bene, non hodie.
He was not.	Non erat.
That it is what he says, and that it is true.	Quod sit quod dicit, et verum sit.
Yes! 	Ita!
even so	etiam sic.
I need advice.	consilium mihi opus est.
It was what it seemed.	Erat quod videbatur.
He can't get this.	Hoc habere non potest.
The journey is fun.	Iter, amet.
It was great.	Magna erat.
I'm here when I need it.	Hic ego cum opus sit.
And now this.	Et nunc hoc.
Maybe they are okay now.	Forsitan bene nunc sunt.
You're not me.	Non es me.
i can go in and out.	possum ire et in.
I never even got to see him.	Numquam vel obtinuit ut eum.
I don't know exactly what it is.	Quid sit prorsus nescio.
You are my father.	Pater meus es.
But he made me better.	Sed melius me fecit.
You don't know why you're here.	Nihil scis cur hic sis.
He will always be with us.	Semper nobiscum erit.
He asked what had happened.	Quaesivit quid factum esset.
Just don't like it.	Iustus non placet.
I didn't think it was enough.	Non putavit satis esse.
Yes, as I said please.	Etiam ut dictum velit.
I did not say when, but.	Non dixi cum, sed.
If you get what you want.	Si id quod vis.
You are not right.	Non recte.
I wonder how that was.	Miror quomodo id esset.
These are mine.	Haec mea sunt.
He could also be here.	Potuit etiam hic esse.
And this is the first thing you need to do.	Et hoc primum debes facere.
yes you can't get some out of it.	Etiam non aliquam ex.
To deal with the matter.	Agere rem.
Yes it is right.	Ita recte est.
He ate quickly.	Cito comedit.
For he knew what he did not know.	Sciebat enim quod nesciebat.
I want a guy to do something like this for me.	Volo a guy ut aliquid simile hoc mihi.
At least that's what she thought.	Id certe putavit.
Even not before.	Etiam non ante quam.
Which seems to be true, but it is not.	Quod verum videtur, sed non est.
This is not good.	Hoc non est bonum.
How does this work?	Quomodo hoc opus facit?
He only knew he could do it.	Solus sciebat id facere posse.
But rather than him.	Sed sed ipsum quam.
That guy was really happy tonight.	Guy vere felix illa nocte fuit.
I just can't get this.	Modo hoc habere non potest.
Really, really good stuff.	Vere, vere bonus domi.
when i can't talk.	Cum dicere non potest.
He was her husband.	Erat vir suus.
You said everything to you.	Dixisti omnia tibi.
Where does the money come from?	Ubi pecuniam venire?
The same can also be true for us.	Idem etiam nobis verum esse potest.
That's how it's done.	Id quomodo factum est.
Which is hardly true.	Quod vix verum est.
What's the last thing you need.	Quid tandem opus sit.
I was really happy.	Vere felix fui.
He is just a guy to be happy.	Is iustus a guy ut felix.
You want money.	Pecuniam vis.
We can do nothing which cannot be done without us.	Nihil possumus quod sine nobis fieri non potest.
All right, very well.	Recte, optime.
Same thing to me in this way.	Idem mihi sic.
He ate his lunch quickly.	Prandium suum cito comedit.
I want to believe my mom doesn't like it.	Volo credere meum, non est simile.
This is not enough.	Hoc parum est.
I will do something else.	Ego aliquid aliud.
That was good for me.	Illa mihi bona fuit.
I guess	Suspicor.
Well done.	Bene fecit.
You're time to think about us.	Tempus es ut nos velis cogitare.
You are doing well.	Id bene facis.
For always.	Semper enim.
No, not.	Non, non.
Look at what's happened.	Vide quid acciderit.
In this it is said.	In id dictum est.
Maybe it is not.	Forte non est.
It is good, this is good.	Bonum est, bonum hic est.
Yes exactly this has been done.	Ita prorsus hoc factum est.
It does not please.	Non placet.
What are you going to do with that.	Quid tibi facturus est illa.
But it was great to hear.	Audire magna sed erat.
Just like you.	Sicut et tibi.
That's the very thing indeed.	Id ipsum quidem aliquam.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I can't talk at any time.	Non possum dicere quando.
I want you to stop.	Volo te prohibere.
It seems that you are fine.	Videtur quod tu bene.
That night he came.	Illa nocte venit.
Family	Genus .
But neither was he himself.	Sed nec ipsum erat.
I love you.	Amo te.
I want to live with you.	Tecum vivere volo.
My dad just wants to talk.	Pater meus sicut loqui vult.
Or not at all.	Vel non nulla.
You just want people to see it.	Vos iustus volo homines videre eum.
It's his job.	Eius officium est.
Maybe it was like this.	Fortasse sic fuit.
You can't see this.	Hoc videre non potes.
It was not a plan.	Non erat consilium.
What are you doing and who you are.	Quid facis, et quis es.
He knew that.	Sciebat.
I've never seen this before.	Nunquam ante hoc vidi.
You have done well.	Bene fecisti.
I never said.	Numquam dixi.
I'm glad to have done it.	id fecisse gaudeo.
He knows that he can never win.	Scit se nunquam vincere posse.
Nothing I can do.	Nihil possum facere.
It looks good.	Spectat bonum.
that was the plan.	id consilium fuit.
He should not.	Non debet.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
This is no longer a class.	Hoc genus amplius non est.
In front of him.	In ante ipsum.
This was in this respect, he said.	Hoc quantum ad hoc fuit, dixit.
But he can do nothing.	Sed hoc facere nihil potest.
Except for that.	Nisi quam.
Now see this.	Nunc hoc vide.
But he is also himself.	Sed et ipsum est.
I heard nothing about this.	Nihil audivi de hoc.
That's all he says.	Id omnes dicit.
Now is not the time for that.	Nunc tempus nec quam.
And how much this was the plan.	Et quantum hoc esset consilium.
Good question!	Bonum quaestio!
I could not do it at all.	Omnino id facere non potui.
There's no way to make it big.	Nulla ut magna ipsum.
I don't like good.	Non placet bonum.
It's time to say the same thing, but no one said.	Aliquam ut dictum ipsum, sed dictum nulla.
We appreciate talking to you.	Ut bene nobis loquitur tecum.
I know it's going to be hard to talk.	Scio futurum esse difficile loqui.
I don't think it's true.	Non puto verum esse.
All right on the job.	Omnia recte officium.
He refused to accept anything.	Hoc aliquid accipere noluit.
He likes nothing more than himself.	Nihil plus vult ad ipsum.
I don't like to talk.	Non placet loqui.
He just can't help it.	Ille iustus non potest eam adiuvare.
I need to go to the mall today.	Mihi opus est hodie ire ad vir.
Just do it.	Solum fac id.
That's what's behind.	Id quod est post.
You can't see yourself alone.	Te solum videre non potes.
Last week.	Septimana.
My father gave it to me this morning.	Pater hoc mihi mane dedit.
He came here.	Hic venit.
But we are still here.	Sed tamen hic sumus.
I watched the film.	Vidi in amet.
He did not know what was needed.	Nesciebat quid opus esset.
I have enough already.	Satis jam habeo.
To act.	Agere.
She told me.	Indicavit mihi.
This is no longer there.	Hoc iam non est.
I want you to come with me.	Volo te mecum venire.
Now I see.	Nunc video.
It's fine.	Bene habet.
There was so much money.	Tantum pecuniae erat.
This video has a little more.	Hoc video paulo plus habet.
And there was something.	Erat et aliquid.
I need to talk.	Mihi opus est dicere.
I'm going to have a good time.	Eo habere tempus bonum.
Now it seems to be working.	Nunc opus esse videtur.
He said nothing.	Nihil dixit.
I don't know when.	Nescio quando.
I think he will be there.	Puto eum ibi esse.
He did not understand.	Non intellexit.
I love this one so much.	Hoc unum tantum amo.
That can be.	Quod potest esse.
Certainly he had not one.	Certe unum non habuit.
Or for the purpose.	Vel ad rem.
That's for sure.	Id certe est.
and i know a lot about him.	et multum scio de eo.
I heard what he said	Audivi quod dixit
Same thing for all, really.	Idem pro omnibus, vere.
men into men.	homines in homines.
He speaks only when he chooses.	Loquitur tantum cum vellet.
That's what's important to me.	Id quod mihi magna est.
And after this, that was in me.	Et post hoc, illud in me fuit.
It was too little to say.	Parum erat dicere.
I don't believe it would be.	Non credo fore.
That's who you are.	Ut quis ipsum quam.
Too great.	Magna nimis.
It was great.	Erat magna.
It is certain, he did so.	Certum est, ita fecit.
I can't speak.	Non possum dicere.
Soon after.	Paulo post.
I don't see anything else.	Non video aliud.
To go now.	Ire nunc.
The thing is, he did not.	Res est, non fecit.
He refused to speak.	Noluit loqui.
Nothing has been done for a long time.	Diu nihil factum est.
None or more than one said.	Nulla vel dictum quam.
There was nothing that he was not willing to see.	Nihil erat quod non vellet videre.
You should not go alone.	Solus ire non debes.
You want to go.	Vis ire.
I thought.	Cogitavi.
But enough about me.	Sed de me satis.
Hardly told me.	Vix mihi indicavit.
Good to see you again.	Bonum est videre vos.
He does not speak.	Non loquitur.
I would not.	Nolui.
What is the journey?	Quod iter est!.
But to be through him.	Sed per ipsum esse.
You can't stay here.	Hic manere non potes.
Don't help me yet.	Ne me adiuvet adhuc.
To get to.	Ut ad.
Back to the guy.	Ad guy.
See what it is.	Vide quid sit.
We'll be fine.	Bene nobis erit.
I was in him.	in eo fui.
She's really got along with him.	Illa vere obtinuit cum eo.
It is not enough.	Parum est.
But he could not find it.	Sed invenire non potuit.
Not sure if that's the case.	Non certe si ita est.
Don't do this again.	Noli iterum hoc facere.
You can also do it by yourself.	Etiam id ex potes.
Thus you said.	Sic dixisti.
So it is.	Ita est.
But that is only.	Sed id est nisi.
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
But he still has it.	Sed tamen habet.
We can't stop now.	Nunc prohibere non possumus.
So its good.	Ita bonum suum.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
But time is not so easy.	Sed tempus, non tam facile.
I wanted to believe.	Credere volui.
I don't want to be there.	Non vis ibi esse.
Many people do it.	Multa homines id.
We can take it a lot.	Id multa possumus accipere.
You are thinking.	Cogitas.
I believe you are right.	Recte credo.
I'm not with him yet.	Im 'non cum eo tamen.
But it's enough, you know.	Sed satis est, scis.
I heard both.	utrumque audivi.
and looks good.	et spectat bonum.
Yes, that's how it is now.	Etiam id nunc quam.
It was work in the morning.	Mane opus erat.
It seemed very unlikely.	Valde probabile videbatur.
But it is not true.	Sed non est verum.
Certainly you know.	Certe scis.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
I thought about this.	Cogitavi de hoc.
The boy himself appears.	Puer quidem ipse videtur.
All good things only.	Omnia bona tantum.
I don't want this to ever happen.	Nolo hoc umquam fieri.
Soon again.	Mox iterum.
Maybe he already has one.	Fortasse iam unum habet.
And perhaps this was it.	Et fortasse hoc illud fuit.
No one wants to.	Nulla a velit.
He ought to know.	Scire debet.
Even by us.	Etiam per nos.
now I do not believe.	iam non credo.
The only way.	Solum modo.
I believe this to be so.	Hoc ita esse credo.
That was it.	Erat id.
Certainly not.	Non certe.
Maybe it was that.	Aliquam erat id.
Don't talk so loud.	Noli tam magna loqui.
He could not do more.	Non potuit amplius facere.
The situation is as stated above.	ita se res habet sicut dictum est.
it will not be certain for me.	certum mihi non erit.
You will have to do everything.	Faciendum erit tibi omnia.
I think you know where it is going.	scire te puto quo id eat.
Name of the job.	Nomen illud officium.
I am very sorry.	Valde sum.
We're both still together.	Ambo adhuc una sumus.
Now it's yours.	Nunc tuum est.
He said nothing to me.	Nihil de eo dixit, ad me.
Never love yourself.	Numquam ipsum.
I want you.	te volo.
There was.	Fuit.
I like school.	Mihi placet schola.
Or pretty much everything.	Vel bene fere omnia.
I am not yet there.	Nondum ibi sum.
Now it's not him.	Nunc non ipsum est.
I will say this.	Dicam id.
glad to see you.	gaudeo te videre.
You can see it here.	Videre eam hic videre potes.
It was necessary to go to her.	Ad eam ire necesse erat.
It can be done again.	Fieri iterum potest.
That's what they are.	Id sunt enim.
I want.	Volo.
Why on my day.	Cur in diem meum.
It's not too hard for you to play.	Nec tibi difficile est ludere.
i was at home.	domi eram.
He did indeed.	Fecit ille quidem.
That was yours.	Tuum id erat.
There was yet another.	Aliud fuit tamen.
He knew it was not about him.	Sciebat non esse de eo.
that is where we are.	id est quo nos.
I wish it were.	Utinam esset.
Everything I tried to do.	Omnia conatus sum facere.
But he did not know everything.	Sed non omnia sciebat.
But we can do something about this.	Sed de hoc aliquid possumus.
Never say this.	Numquam id dicere.
perhaps he had.	fortasse habuit.
That's a zero.	Ut a nulla erat.
It is, and yet it is not.	Est, et tamen non est.
he said.	dixit.
I know it.	Novi.
Yes that's for now.	Etiam id nunc enim.
But perhaps not for long.	Sed fortasse non diu.
You are right.	Recte facis.
in him we are one.	in eo una sumus.
That alone will not work.	Quod solum opus non erit.
I was enough.	satis eram.
Just do it at home.	Sicut domi facere velis.
At that time.	In illo tempore.
Certainly I said, when.	certe dixi, quando.
I don't want to know.	Nolo scire.
It's not like you.	Hoc non est simile tibi.
I've never seen her.	Nunquam eam vidi.
I told him thirty.	Triginta ei dixi.
That's how important it is.	Ut id quam magna.
So I did.	Sic feci.
I just didn't want to be bad.	Modo nolui malum esse.
Well, there is no need.	Bene, opus non est.
He would never do this.	Hoc nunquam faceret.
This can be evil.	Malum hoc esse potest.
Now see what you've done.	Nunc vide quid feceris.
What to do.	Quod ut facias.
Not much.	Non multum.
That's nothing more than never.	Id nihil numquam quam.
But there was something.	Erat aliquid, sed.
He always says it.	Semper id dicit.
That's hardly the only thing that's happened.	Vix solus id acciderit.
Maybe he wanted something better for you than he.	Forsitan melius tibi aliquid voluit quam ille.
It's pretty good.	Satis bonus est.
exactly the same.	Idem prorsus.
Not as always, but as.	Non ut semper, sed quod.
Talk to someone.	Loqui ad aliquem.
There was nothing that could hinder him.	Nihil erat quod prohibere posset.
I didn't think it would happen.	Non putabam sic fore.
For he knew that it was true.	Sciebat enim verum esse.
There's no reason you're here.	Non est cur hic sis.
He does nothing.	Nihil facit.
i love what you see.	amo quod vide.
You're all here to do this.	Hoc vos omnes hic facere.
I have to tell you what I mean.	Non habeo tibi dicere quid hoc velit.
But not at all well.	Sed omnino bene.
I never wanted this to happen.	Numquam hoc fieri volui.
It was hard.	Difficile erat.
I've never done anything.	Ego numquam quicquam feci.
But who is the guy.	Sed quis est amet.
I love these things.	Haec amo.
It can be done in this way or in that way.	Potest hoc modo vel illo modo.
He wanted more, he came more.	Plus voluit, venit plus.
They are close to each other.	Proxima sunt inter se.
But help is needed.	Sed auxilio est opus.
it was only about what he did not know.	tantum erat de eo quod nesciebat.
A good man could do the same.	Idem facere potuit vir bonus.
We can still find each other.	Tamen inter se invenire possumus.
you do yourself and do nothing else.	te ipsum facis, et nihil aliud facit.
I am the one for sure.	Mihi unum pro certo est.
Not here, not his.	Non hic, non eius.
None in none.	Nulla in nulla ipsum.
Take some time.	Aliquam tempus.
I know that's not a thing.	Scio rem non esse.
But it is not as it is.	Sed non est ut est.
i have done nothing wrong.	nihil mali feci.
But to save time.	Sed ut tempus nisi.
I think it's not here.	Puto hic non esse.
He is gone with me.	Abiit me.
People are not that kind.	Homines non id genus.
Essentially difficult.	Per se difficile.
What that is is more than okay.	Quid illud est, quod plus quam bene.
It's good for you.	Tibi bonum est.
She never told him.	Quae numquam ei.
It was too late, he knew.	Sero erat, sciebat.
I don't like doing anything.	Non placet facere quicquam.
She finally came home.	Illa tandem domum venit.
There was absolutely nothing.	Prorsus nihil fuit.
That	Quod
Get me away from him.	Ut me ab eo.
He comes to me.	Venit ad me.
I'm sorry!.	Paenitet!.
There is a lot to see.	Est multum videre.
I think they like each other.	Puto quod placet inter se.
I've been here.	Fui hic.
Which is not so.	Quod non ita est.
Nothing much to say.	Nihil multa dicam.
I didn't think through.	Non putabat per.
I am doing really well.	Ego vere bene facio.
Unable to leave.	Posset relinquere.
Which would be better.	Quod melius esset.
It is good.	Bonum est.
And he said so.	Et dixit sic.
That's not zero.	Ut non nulla.
Good thing too.	Bona quoque res.
I didn't know who it was.	Nesciebam quis esset.
I wonder what it looks like.	Miror quid simile.
You need to know.	Scire debes.
If you haven't already.	Si nondum erat.
And good too.	Et bonus etiam.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
He did not say, but.	Non dixit, sed.
The work is not too bad.	Opus non est nimis malum.
I can't act now.	Non possum nunc agere.
Not even one day.	Ne unum quidem diem.
But that was always.	Sed id semper erat.
It will be better for you.	Melius tibi erit.
How you can do whatever you want.	Quam potes hoc facere quod vis.
I've heard everything.	Audivi omnia.
I wanted one before.	Unum ante vellem.
Too many things.	Nimis multa.
Tomorrow is gonna be great.	Cras sit amet ante magna.
and he does it better.	et melius facit.
Or who, you know.	Vel quis, scis.
I like him all in all.	Placet ei omnia in omnibus.
Why did he not do this.	Quare hoc non fecit.
This one is not.	Hoc unum non est.
I like to see this.	Placet hoc ipsum videre.
This was one thing.	Hoc unum erat.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
That's the same thing we have.	Id ipsum habemus.
But he was and was.	Sed erat, et erat.
No other.	Non aliud.
It's not bad.	Non est malum.
This is already enough.	Hic iam satis est.
But see what you want too.	Sed vide quid etiam vis.
I can hardly hear you.	Vix te audire possum.
You can help me if you want.	Potes me, si vis, adiuvare.
Nothing is.	Nihil est.
I heard about you.	Audivi de te.
After, not before.	Post, non ante.
It is difficult to know what to believe.	Difficile est scire quid sit credere.
She has too much money.	Pecuniam nimis multum habet.
I know it's not possible.	Scio non posse.
You want me.	Tu vis.
Not in any way.	Nec in aliquam.
I don't do what I don't want.	Non quod nolo, facio.
That would be very hard.	Quod admodum difficile esset.
I want to know.	Scire volo.
You are alone.	Solus es.
I just want to help in some way.	Ego iustus volo aliquo modo adiuvare.
He was a guy.	Guy erat.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
This is for her.	Hoc pro suo.
This is the same.	Hoc idem est.
But here it is.	Hic tamen, sit.
We are all one.	Omnes unum sumus.
I never asked.	Numquam quaesivit.
This is not working.	Hoc opus non est.
That's not good.	Ut 'non est bonum.
But this is your plan.	Sed tuum consilium est.
That was it.	Erat id.
Don't stay long.	Non diu manere.
What is the name.	Quod nomen est.
Up to this point.	Huc usque.
I did the same thing, and I did many things.	Idem ego feci et multa feci.
The man is just going.	Vir iustus eat.
It was only to be honest.	Ut sit amet erat nisi.
I don't already have anyone.	Non iam quis.
He wanted to do everything.	Omnia facere voluit.
i thought i got it.	Putabam eam obtinuit.
And so here.	Ita et hic.
That's very important.	Ut id ipsum magna.
I was in it.	Fui in eo.
Yes that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum.
We're here for you.	Hic sumus tibi.
I am astonished at this.	Miror hoc.
We can't really.	Non possumus vere.
It was certain.	Certum fuit.
It is time to go.	Tempus est ire.
It is certain.	Certum est.
But even he was himself.	Sed vel ipsum erat.
Take a look at this one.	Vide hoc unum.
It should not be done.	Fieri non debet.
It probably was.	Probabile fuit.
He doesn't know what to say.	Nescit quid dicam.
Why don't you say it.	Cur dicere non est.
Even a little.	Etiam paulo.
Maybe not yourself.	Aliquam non ipsum.
You can see right?	Potes videre, recte?
Please stay with him.	Mane quaeso cum eo.
He said yes.	Dixit etiam.
Probably it will be.	Verisimiliter erit.
I was not the same, nor was she.	non ipse fui, nec illa fuit.
And what is this? 	Et quid est hoc?
No one gave me so much as you.	Nemo mihi tantum quantum tibi dedit.
I said before.	ante dixi.
I don't like it today.	Non placet hodie.
Of him or her.	Eius vel eius.
I don't even know how.	Nescio etiam quomodo.
But neither was he himself.	Sed nec ipsum erat.
You will never do this.	Hoc nunquam facias.
Do not do too much.	Ne quid nimis.
For truly.	Vere enim.
i thought i could play.	posse putavi ludere.
Do what you want.	Fac id quod vis.
I don't want to go home.	Domum ire nolo.
Too much is too much.	Nimis nimis est.
Do you know.	Scisne.
I see what can't be there.	Video quid ibi esse non possit.
You know.	Scis.
In this way .	Hoc modo .
You want to act.	Vis agere.
He never knows.	Numquam scit.
So "what's for dinner?" 	Sic, "quid ad cenam?"
But it will be fine.	Sed bene erit.
I was on the job.	essem officium.
I wanted something.	rem volui.
I never thought.	Numquam cogitavi.
You have done well.	Recte fecisti.
Now everybody wants to hear it again.	Nunc omnes iterum audire vult.
But it's next week.	Sed id septimana proxima est.
I made my way home.	Ego iter meum feci in domum suam.
Tell me where it is.	Dic ubi sit.
Get to know you a little.	Scire te parum.
He likes to be himself.	Velit ut ipsum.
Now I have enough money.	Iam satis pecuniae habeo.
Get yourself out of it.	Ut et ipsum ex.
one does of his own.	unus de suo facit.
i'm not enough.	parum sum.
This is what is going to happen.	Hoc est quod futurum est.
I don't mean anything.	Non aliquid vult.
Maybe that's it.	Aliquam id est.
No one could do this better.	Hoc nemo melius facere potuit.
What he wanted .	Quid vellet .
He is going to get there.	Ibi ut eat.
But there is nothing for you.	Sed non est quod tibi.
Do it for fun.	Fac ut amet.
I know everything to tell you.	Scio omnia tibi dicere.
But it is time.	Sed tempus sit.
That was it.	Erat id.
That's us.	Id nobis.
But no one knows what will happen.	Sed, quid futurum sit, nemo scit.
Yes but no.	Etiam sed dictum nulla.
Now he doesn't want it before.	Nunc nec velit ante.
It's time for either.	Aliquam vel est enim.
I can't go through this again.	Per hoc iterum ire non possum.
It was tonight.	Hac nocte fuit.
Help was needed.	Auxilio opus erat.
I've never forgotten this plan.	Nunquam id consilium oblitus sum.
He did not know.	Nesciebat.
That was very happy.	Ut sit amet ipsum erat.
He doesn't want to be in there.	In non velit enim.
Or as he thinks.	Vel ut cogitat.
But there is only one.	Sed non est nisi.
And he wanted him.	Et voluit eum.
It is not difficult.	Non difficile est.
It looks pretty good too.	Spectat etiam satis bonum.
And you can stop what is going to happen.	Et potes prohibere quid futurum sit.
It was correct indeed.	Erat recte quidem.
but never sure.	sed certum numquam.
He knows you're here.	Scit te hic esse.
I'm not trying to tell you.	Im 'non conatur ad vos.
It is his.	Eius sit.
men	homines.
Nothing about him.	Nihil de illo.
The man who knows you.	Homo qui te novit.
I could be good.	Potui esse bonus.
But it is OK.	Bene autem est.
But it was not great.	Sed non erat magna.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
He did well too.	Bene quoque fecit.
He was in it now.	In id nunc erat.
I am not like my husband.	Non sum sicut vir meus.
I hope you know what this is.	Spero te scire quid hoc sit.
It is getting late.	Nuper questus est.
He ought to have.	Debet habere.
This is always a good e.	Semper bonus haec e.
I don't think it is, but it is.	Non puto esse, sed est.
I haven't seen him for a long time.	Non diu eum vidi.
Yes, but there was some.	Etiam sed aliquam erat.
I said always.	Dixi semper.
I didn't go through the same thing I thought.	Non per simile putavi.
You are not mine.	Non es meus.
Now	Nunc.
I am surprised so much.	Miror tantum.
They are not all.	Non sunt omnia.
No one knows that she is.	Nemo scit eam esse.
It's not his real name.	Non est eius verum nomen.
He can't hear right now.	Non potest nunc recte audire.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
that is years and years.	id est annos et annos.
As I can no longer live.	Sicut iam vivere non possum.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Noluit mecum loqui.
We cannot see.	Videre non possumus.
he loves them all.	omnes amat.
It is not enough.	Non satis.
In et in et.	In et in et.
But it was too much for me.	Sed nimium mihi erat.
Who also wants that.	Etiam quis velit quam.
I will make it happen.	Fieri faciam.
You can call me very well.	Potes me optime.
It's like somebody before.	Est ut quis ante.
But it is what it is.	Sed sit id est.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
I don't know how you got it.	Nescio quomodo obtinuit.
He said this.	Hoc dixit.
He was also from before.	Etiam a ante erat.
The thing has to be.	Res habet esse.
It seemed perhaps not.	Non videbatur fortasse.
I've never seen anything like it.	Nunquam quicquam simile vidi.
None of this was for us.	Nulla id nobis erat.
it was great.	magna erat.
A you know.	A scis.
It could have been so easy for me.	Tam facile me potuit.
i'm still.	sum usque.
But some more than that.	Sed aliquam quam.
He was so good to me.	Tam bonus erat mihi.
In some way.	Modo in aliquam.
Look at the job.	Vide ad officium.
It was just after lunch.	Is mox post prandium fuit.
As in a.	Ut a.
To live as we cannot do.	Vivere sicut nos facere non potest.
What are you up to.	Quod ad eam es.
It can't be good.	Bonum esse non potest.
No one has to go.	Nemo habet ire.
Things don't go well.	Res non bene.
Or nothing else.	Vel nihil aliud.
But that's always before.	Sed id semper ante.
Today was one day.	Hodie unus dies erat.
Good man.	Vir bonus.
Something's wrong.	Aliquid mali.
I don't know what this is.	Nescio quid hoc sit.
I would not say yes to him.	Nolui etiam ei dicere.
Can't believe	Non potest credere.
often I do.	saepe facio.
I have done this.	Hoc ego feci.
Let me tell you something.	Dicam tibi aliquid.
i think i could do both.	posse puto utrumque.
He came here.	Hic venit.
I tried so hard, but I couldn't do it.	Conatus sum ita, sed facere non potui.
I've seen it and it still looks good to me.	Ego vidi et bonum mihi adhuc spectat.
Why did he do this.	Cur hoc faceret.
I will not.	Nolo.
I want to make money.	Pecuniam facere volo.
I never knew you could do this.	Numquam scivi te hoc facere posse.
But there was something about him.	Sed de eo aliquid erat.
But not how to do so.	Sed non quam id.
Work is either done or not done.	Opus vel factum vel non factum.
which I see now.	quod nunc video.
Yes they are men.	Ita homines sunt.
I will speak in this way.	Hoc modo dicam.
He was not himself.	Non erat ipsum.
We can't do it yet.	Id tamen facere non possumus.
What time is it now?	Quid nunc temporis est?
So perhaps there is something in it.	Ita fortasse aliquid est in eo.
We don't need to do anything with it.	Non opus est nobis facere aliquid ex eo.
But that's the same thing as none.	Sed id ipsum ut nulla.
He said I could definitely help.	Dixit mihi certum auxilium posse.
It's 'good'.	Suus 'bonus'.
Well one really.	Bene unum vere.
No it is not.	Nulla non est.
Now she does no good.	Nunc bonum non facit.
I can't think of anything to say.	Non possum dicere aliquid cogitare.
There it was.	Ibi fuit.
I can be there pretty easily.	Ibi satis facile possum.
This is true even here.	Verum hic etiam hoc.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Aliquam non velit.
This is all.	Hoc totum est.
But more than that.	Plus tamen.
Something I'm doing.	Aliquid me facere.
But you need to know it.	Sed id scire debes.
I could not do this.	Hoc facere non potui.
I can't believe this too!	Ego quoque hoc credere non possum!
Right, you know.	Recte, scis.
I don't feel it.	Ego non sentio.
You owe me	Debes mihi .
He is so happy.	Tam felix est.
No, we can't help you.	Non, te adiuvare non possumus.
Don't play with us.	Noli nobiscum ludere.
That's what you're doing.	Id tibi facere.
And this is not another.	Et hoc non est aliud.
I have done so.	Feci ita.
I will not.	Nolo.
This is better.	Hoc melius.
You can do nothing.	Nihil potes.
What happened to him?	Quid ei acciderit.
all by means of.	omnes per.
That's a bad time.	Malum id tempus.
At length he gave.	Tandem dedit.
I think he says like that.	Dicit puto simile est.
But that which was made was not rightly done.	Sed eius quod factum est, non recte factum est.
I don't know what else to say.	Quid aliud dicam nescio.
I don't know how to do this.	Nescio quomodo hoc facias.
This man has no money.	Hic homo pecuniam non habet.
That's a good one to say.	Quod est dicere unum bonum.
At last together.	Simul tandem.
But as stated above.	Sed ut dictum est.
He was there.	Erat ibi.
It's a teacher.	Est magister.
But that is not, no one does.	Sed id non est, nemo facit.
I know I'm good.	Scio me esse bonum.
And finally got it.	Et tandem obtinuit eum.
But there is nothing wrong.	Sed nihil mali.
Maybe that was great.	Aliquam id magna erat.
yes or some button.	Etiam vel aliquam ipsum.
So it is not for me.	Ita non est mihi.
But you have to understand.	Sed habes intelligere.
But it is not difficult.	Sed non est difficile.
It is what it is.	Est quid est.
You don't want to do that?	Tu non vis facere?
One thing is not enough.	Unum quod non est satis.
He was not sure what was prepared.	Non erat certus quid paratus esset.
But this is he.	Sed hoc ille.
Certainly it could not have been done.	Fieri certe non potuit.
Please don't	Noli quaeso!
Thus you have .	Sic habes .
And yet I don't like it.	Et tamen non placet.
Not just to do it.	Non solum id facere.
Don't get it from him.	Noli id ​​ab eo accipere.
But first let me tell you why we're here.	Sed primum me dicam cur hic sumus.
I know you're doing what you can.	scio te facere quod potes.
I tried them all.	Conatus sum omnes.
I've seen a boy yet.	Ego adhuc puer vidi.
There is a plan.	Est consilium.
We are just too much.	Iustus nimium sumus.
To have something.	Habere aliquid.
I still can't believe it.	Ego tamen non possum credere.
I have not seen.	Non vidi.
It's good to see you again.	Suus 'bonus te videre iterum.
And what he did to me.	Et quod mihi fecit.
And he was with him.	Erat autem cum eo.
I can't think of this.	De hoc cogitare non possum.
He did all things.	Omnia fecit.
And we're still here.	Et adhuc hic sumus.
This doesn't take a lot of time.	Hoc non multum temporis.
No one knows for sure.	Nemo certe scit.
It's not hard to see.	Non difficile est videre.
I have one too.	Habeo etiam unum.
It does not please.	Non placet.
You need to give everything.	Debes omnia dare.
But neither was he.	Sed nec erat.
He thought it could be done.	Putabat fieri posse.
That's only what he wants.	Ut non nisi velit.
I hope that's okay.	Spero quod bene.
Years later.	Annos post.
No, that's true.	Non, quod verum est.
Now do it again.	Nunc iterum fac.
It can't be.	Non potest esse.
I'm glad we didn't.	Gaudeo nos non.
And it was.	Et fuit.
It is.	Est.
Much has been done.	Multum factum est.
And this is not good.	Et hoc non est bonum.
I would do so.	Facerem.
You have me good.	Habes me bonum.
You don't want to know well.	Bene scire non vis.
I told you next week.	Proxima septimana tibi dixi.
Don't even want it.	Ne id quidem velit.
that is only.	id est solum.
He could not do this.	Hoc facere potuit.
Just do your job.	Modo officium tuum fac.
But that's none of it.	Sed id nulla ex.
I have done it.	Feci.
In the end, it was not enough.	Tandem satis non esset.
Maybe it is not.	Aliquam non est est.
It certainly looks good.	Certe bonum spectat.
One.	Unus.
Or trying to be.	Vel conatur esse.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
He would not be able to do so.	Noluit posse.
It's true! 	Verum!
She could still be.	Posset adhuc esse.
I don't want to be again.	Iterum esse nolo.
Certainly never with him.	Numquam certe cum eo.
Looks like what's happened.	Simile quid acciderit.
if you can.	si potes.
I am determined in the morning.	Mane certum habeo.
Why do you do this correctly.	Quid recte hoc facias.
It was enough to say so.	Tam satis erat dicere.
He ate his lunch quickly and went away.	Prandium suum cito comedit et abiit.
I told her I don't think about doing this.	Dixi ei non cogitare de hoc facere.
But you can't go.	Sed non potes ire.
Everyone does better.	Melius omnes facit.
But in all things it was great.	Sed in omnibus magna erat.
and you are in it.	et es in eo.
They are not men.	Non sunt homines.
He was not happy.	Felix non erat.
That's for sure.	Quod certe.
I want to swim more	Plus natare volo .
One thing is certain.	Certum est unum.
Nothing got me wrong.	Nihil mali obtinuit me est.
With that said.	Cum ut dictum.
Been there for three years.	Fuit ibi per tres annos.
Maybe, she thought.	Fortasse, putavit.
We can't do both.	Utrumque facere non possumus.
He saw her.	Vidit eam.
He could not, however.	Non potuit tamen.
Do it, you know.	Facere, scis.
And see again.	Et iterum vide.
I'm a man.	Im homo.
And in this way it will be.	Et hoc modo futurum est.
he wished to remain.	manere voluit.
No one can know.	Nemo potest scire.
Wish you better in advance.	Melius ante velit.
He thought.	Putabat.
I don't know his name.	Nomen eius non novi.
It was too late.	Sero erat.
I don't do anything.	Non aliquid.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
He would not say this.	Noluit hoc dicere.
He speaks better.	Melius loquitur.
It is good in all things.	Bonum est in omnibus.
But neither was that.	Sed nec erat quam.
That's never, ever done before.	Quod nunquam, umquam ante factum est.
And we can talk a little about it.	Et de illo parum possumus loqui.
We cannot be certain.	Certum esse non possumus.
I need to say.	Opus est dicere.
Not only.	Non solum.
Maybe not.	Fortasse non.
It is similar.	Similis est.
I could not think of it myself.	Non potui me de illa cogitare.
Getting here late.	Hic nuper questus.
But there isn't anything wrong with you.	Sed aliquid mali non esse tibi.
and not there.	et non ibi.
I did it again.	Iterum feci.
It was not done.	Non factum est.
But he did not leave there.	Sed non reliquit ibi.
She doesn't even know what she did.	Illa ne scit quidem quid fecerit.
And he was still there.	Et erat adhuc ibi.
For he was.	Erat enim.
who is it or	quis est an.
But I will say this.	Sed ego hoc dicam.
Perhaps he did nothing.	Forsitan ille nihil fecit.
Which I could not do.	Quod facere non potui.
One man	Unus homo .
It's time to save time.	Aliquam sit amet tempus nisi.
Well, that's good to hear.	Bene, quod bonum est audire.
I've heard a lot.	Audivi multum.
No one tried to talk to him.	Nemo ex eo loqui conatus est.
That is.	Id est.
I just want to see what's going to happen.	EGO iustus volo videre quid futurum sit.
Too late, too late, too late.	Sero, Sero, Sero.
If anything was for you.	Si quid erat tibi.
I'll get you some way.	Faciam ut tibi aliquo modo.
Everything is great.	Omnia magna.
He did it himself.	Se id fecit.
No one could do this anymore.	Nemo hoc amplius facere potuit.
if they remain.	si manere.
He did not tell.	Non indicavit.
It's not a hard decision for me.	Mihi non est difficile consilium.
Why did you decide to leave your job?	Quid feci tibi placet tuum officium relinquere?
Nothing to do here.	Nihil hic facere.
This was it.	Hoc erat illud.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
What's better!?	Quid melius!?.
I'm just a guy who knows why.	Im iustus guy qui scit quid.
You know what you've done.	Scis quid feceris.
You know it's not possible.	Scis non posse.
I wanted to feel so bad that I was going to be there.	tam male me futurum habere volui.
This just did something to him.	Hic modo aliquid ei fecit.
We need to talk.	Loqui nobis opus est.
He says now is not a good time.	Dicit nunc tempus bonum non esse.
He didn't say anything.	Non dixit aliquid.
I could not live with me.	Mecum vivere non potui.
She already understood.	Jam illa intellexit.
i really like it.	vere placet.
That's going to be hard.	Id difficile futurum est.
I tried my best.	Conatus sum meum.
I think you know it.	Scis eam puto.
But as it is.	Sed ut est.
I am certain.	Certum habeo.
I don't think it would be.	Non puto fore.
and it was scarcely possible.	et vix erat.
You'd better say yes.	Melius etiam dicere velis.
It's not so bad.	Non ita malum est.
There is certainly something wrong with him.	Est certe aliquid mali apud eum.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
Soon again.	Mox iterum.
and he understood.	et intellexit.
He can do anything.	Quicquam potest.
This he does well.	Hoc bene facit.
And your hug is fine.	Et amet tua, bene est.
I've never done anything.	Nunquam quicquam fieri.
He did not know why.	Quod nesciebat, cur.
But he did not come.	Sed non venit.
It doesn't seem to matter.	Ad rem non videtur.
No one speaks of him anymore.	De eo amplius nemo loquitur.
Can't stop looking.	Non potest prohibere vultus.
It is not exactly so.	Prorsus non ita est.
I am almost certainly.	Fere certe ego.
It's great.	Est magna.
This is good.	Hoc bonum est.
This does a lot.	Hoc facit multum.
No one else yet.	Nemo tamen.
We don't have a dog.	Canem non habemus.
You have to give one.	Tibi dare unum.
Advice on him.	Consilium in eo.
All right.	Recte.
By this he was before.	Per id ante erat.
I also want a name.	Ego quoque nomen volo.
They are very used to it.	Valde solebat.
But now here again.	Sed iam hic iterum.
It is time to think.	Tempus est ut videtur.
And it will be soon.	Et mox futurum est.
Nothing really happened.	Nihil vere factum est.
I've done this completely.	Ego omnino hoc feci.
You know for sure.	Scis certe.
And nothing.	Et nihil.
There's nothing in it except it.	Nulla in enim nisi.
Maybe that was it.	Aliquam id erat.
Who are they?	Quis sunt?
Now as before.	Nunc ut ipsum ante.
unless by chance my love.	nisi forte mea.
Yes, as it seems.	Ita, ut videtur.
I like the name very much.	Valde mihi placet nomen.
I know this.	Id scio.
It is.	SIC est.
Maybe she was right.	Fortasse recte fuit.
Please try to get it.	Aliquam ut est velit.
But not soon enough.	Sed non satis cito.
Someone has.	Habet aliquis.
He knew what was to be done.	Sciebat quid sibi faciendum esset.
I'm not that good.	Non sum hoc bonum.
and even.	et usque.
How are they here.	Quo modo sunt hic.
Let him go too.	Eat quoque.
You do it at home.	Domi te facere.
You think he is a good guy.	Putas eum esse bonum guy.
He was only a boy.	Erat autem puer tantum.
But he could do nothing.	Posset tamen nihil.
You can't help yourself.	Te ipsum adiuvare non potes.
I don't want you to go.	Nolo te ire.
Someone was so lucky.	Aliquis erat ut felix.
You have enough money to travel so far.	Satis pecuniae habes ad iter tantum.
I don't really know what it's about yet.	Vere scio quid est de adhuc non.
Well maybe not.	Bene fortasse.
He does also.	Facit etiam.
So it is.	Ita est.
He thought better.	Melius putabat.
He's really good.	Ille vere bonum.
I didn't know what the matter was.	Ego nesciebam quid res esset.
He does not do well.	Bene non facit.
He knows everything.	Omnia novit.
Where he is with you is not.	Ubi est cum tecum non est.
Yes, there was some.	Etiam non aliquam erat.
Nothing was enough now.	Modo nihil satis erat.
This season is not so well.	Hoc tempore non ita bene.
I wanted to do this last night.	Hoc facere volui nocte.
he did it too.	fecit etiam.
Nothing but this.	Nihil nisi hac.
But it was in him, as stated above.	Sed in ipsum erat, ut dictum est.
I hope you're doing well.	Spero te bene facere.
Which indeed was good for me.	Quod quidem mihi bonum fuit.
And nothing of it.	Et nihil eius.
I believe it to be true.	verum esse credo.
But it's time for you to do it together.	Sed tempus est tibi ut simul facias.
and this is.	et hoc est.
And see how no one thinks of this.	Et vide quomodo nemo hoc cogitat.
Got a lot of things.	Obtinuit multum.
I don't know what to say.	Nescio quid dicam.
He was not.	Non erat.
And he still wanted to see him.	Et adhuc vellet videre eum.
And there is still much more time.	Et multum temporis est adhuc amplius.
He just wants to play with me.	Tantum vult mecum ludere.
But look at the guy.	Sed vide in guy.
I can't tell you.	Non possum tibi dicere.
You have a plan to do.	Habes consilium ut faciam.
He said nothing about him.	Nihil de eo dixit.
She's recently gone home.	Illa nuper abiit in domum suam.
But not in this way.	Sed non hoc modo.
And it has been said.	Sed et dictum est.
I think about you too.	Te quoque puto.
But it is getting on.	Sed questus est.
Something was wrong.	Aliquid mali fuit.
He doesn't want to leave him now.	Non vult eum nunc relinquere.
There was no such thing as him.	Nulla ut ipsum erat.
Tell her all you need to say.	Dic ei omnia quae debes dicere.
But you should not do this.	Sed hoc ne feceris.
not a lot of time.	Non multum temporis.
When you are not there you need to do it.	Cum non ibi opus faceret.
That's not how.	Ut non quam.
You don't just want to win.	Non solum vis vincere.
I think you do a very good job.	Puto officium valde bonum facere.
And perhaps rightly so.	Et fortasse recte.
Kind of like you.	Genus similis tibi.
I don't want to come.	Nolo venire.
I am sure of that.	Certus sum de illo.
We can do nothing about this.	Nihil de hoc facere possumus.
Too important to him.	Nimis magna ei.
if to.	si ad.
but it was also true.	nisi etiam verum erat.
It is important that you.	Aliquam sit amet quam et.
I can do nothing but live with him.	Non possum nihil agere nisi cum illo vivere.
But this is not possible.	Sed sic fieri non potest.
He could not do this for himself.	Non potuit sibi hoc facere.
I was not.	non fui.
Not easy, but possible.	Non facile, sed fieri potest.
Tonight is too much.	Hac nocte, nimium est.
That's how it is now.	Ut id quam nunc.
Perhaps thirty years ago.	Ante annos triginta fortasse.
I did so myself.	Ita me feci.
It's not good to be.	Non est bonum esse.
I didn't think I would be able to.	Non putabam me posse fore.
But not now.	Sed non nunc.
She's with you today.	Hodie tibi in illa est.
You have to come with me.	Venire habes mecum.
Tomorrow and for	Cras et enim.
Never say never.	Numquam numquam.
And see.	Et vide.
Got to be that far.	Quod usque ad obtinuit.
It's something very important.	Est aliquid ipsum.
it should be late.	Sero debet.
What I am doing.	Quod ego facio.
That's really great.	Ut, vere magna.
It was time to leave.	Tempus erat relinquere.
But this is not likely at all.	Sed hoc omnibus verisimile non est.
It was great to see.	Magna erat videre.
I will never be there.	Numquam ibi me esse.
Good to hear from you.	Bonum est a te audire.
Not so much.	Ne multa.
So you have a plan.	Sic habes consilium.
i'm good.	Sum bonus.
And for me.	Et mihi.
She asked for my name.	Rogavit nomen meum.
And it is still great.	Et adhuc magna est.
The boy seemed to do better, though.	Videbatur puer melius facere, sed.
I don't love you much.	Non multum amo.
He is not there.	Non est ibi.
Do well, if you please.	Bene facias, si placet.
before it was too late.	Sero ante fuit.
I must remain single.	Me unum manere debere.
Well who knows what's happened.	Bene qui scit quid acciderit.
Me and him.	Me et ipsum.
I'm fine.	Bene sum.
Which indeed is true.	Quod quidem verum est.
For it seemed to me also.	Id enim mihi quoque videbatur.
That doesn't mean anything.	Quod non aliquid vult.
Well, yes and no.	Bene, est sic et nulla.
so i love her.	ut eam amo.
He is a good boy, so good a boy.	Bonus puer est , tam bonus puer .
Getting stronger was not a problem.	Questus plus fuit quaestio.
I know what you like.	Scio quid simile.
I am one.	unus sum.
And he is also here.	Et etiam hic est.
There is still a lot of work to be done.	Est adhuc multum opus faciendum.
To do that for anyone.	Facere ut quis.
and at this time.	et hoc tempore.
What do you need.	Quid opus sit vobis.
This is not true.	Hoc non est verum.
This is what actually happened.	Hoc est quod vere factum est.
It is.	Sic est.
Now it was not before.	Nunc non erat ante.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
Himself.	Se ipsum.
which he could not know.	quod scire non potuit.
He was like a dog.	Similis erat canis.
I hope that I have another plan.	Spero quod habeo aliud consilium.
And there.	Et ibi.
What he knows, he knows.	Quod scit, scit.
All	Omnes.
Wife.	Uxorem.
We cannot come there soon.	Cito illuc venire non possumus.
But I don't have any none at all.	Sed non aliquam nulla.
Just why.	Mox cur.
Don't talk for a long time.	Non diu loqui.
Yes it was.	Etiam erat.
It has nothing in itself.	Non habet in se.
It is quite certain.	Satis certum est.
I am very happy about this style!	Multum gaudeo haec loquitur!
Everything you need to know.	Omnia scire opus est.
We're three now.	Nunc tres sumus.
He is gone.	Abiit.
He wanted to know what this meant.	Scire voluit quid hoc esset.
You said, I definitely want it.	Dixisti, certo volo.
That made my day.	Diem meum id fecit.
He has.	Habet.
I wish I could always be there.	Utinam semper possit.
It's just who you are.	Est solum quis es.
I'm a man.	Im 'homo'.
As soon as possible in the room.	Cum primum in cubiculum.
They are all the same.	Omnes idem sunt.
My dad thought it was money.	Pater meus pecuniam putabat.
Where this was.	Quo id erat.
Maybe he wanted to find him.	Fortasse voluit eum invenire.
No, but it is always.	Nulla sed semper est.
Hardly, indeed.	Vix, vere.
Nothing but money.	Nihil nisi pecuniam.
It's late now.	Sero nunc.
You can't do your work.	Opus tuum facere non potes.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
He was a good man.	Erat ille bonus.
I really like you don't think so.	Ego vere amo non puto.
i never had money.	numquam pecuniam habui.
and probably	et verisimiliter.
I don't think ever.	Non puto umquam.
Time to go or never.	Ut tempus ut vel numquam.
But it will be one day.	Sed unus dies erit.
Wasn't this bad last year?	Nonne hoc malum proximo anno fuit?
I have to know.	Habeo scire.
It was not my name.	Nomen non erat meum.
It was easy for me too.	Facile me quoque.
Maybe you're not here.	Forte hic non es.
he knew that he was.	sciebat eum esse.
He does not come.	Non venit.
Tomorrow was needed for me.	Cras opus erat ut ad me.
The man is coming.	Vir venit.
You can't have both.	Utrumque habere non potes.
Not much about him.	Non multum de eo.
But he cannot see.	Sed videre non potest.
But this is something new.	Sed hoc aliquid novi est.
And this he did.	Et hoc fecit.
What do you need.	Quid opus est tibi.
And generally.	Et fere.
i think i could.	posse puto.
This doesn't seem to matter much.	Hoc non multum ad rem videtur.
For he knew correctly.	Sciebat enim recte.
I am glad for you.	ego pro gaudeo.
He was going to be my father.	Facturus erat pater.
It has to be better.	Non habet esse melius.
Really good is what he does.	Vere bonum est quod facit.
and nothing comes.	et nihil venit.
He should be here too.	Debet hic quoque.
As you like.	Ut tibi placet.
So that he is going.	Ita ut eat.
This is where we are.	Haec ubi nos sumus.
do it, do it.	eam fac fac.
I don't even want it.	Ne id quidem volo.
But you don't have a problem.	Sed quaestio non facis.
He speaks a little about it.	Fere parum loquitur.
No in how great.	Nulla in quam magna.
They're fun people.	Sunt amet homines.
Certainly not for the better.	Certe non in melius.
Even so.	Etiam ut.
He knew he was more than that.	Sciebat se plus esse quam illud.
yes no how no.	Etiam non quam nulla.
Enough is enough.	Satis est satis.
That's what you do.	Id quod facis.
What did you do after school yesterday?	Quid fecisti post scholam heri?
It is important to be prepared for this game.	Aliquam sit amet paratus ut id ipsum.
This was good with me.	Hoc bene apud me fuit.
He knows what's happened.	Scit quid acciderit.
i know where he is.	scio ubi sit.
That was a lot of necessity.	Quod multum necesse fuit.
It's not what we have today.	Non est quod hodie habemus.
No one comes to talk to me.	Nemo venit mecum loqui.
I just want to come and help.	EGO iustus volo venire et auxilium.
It does not please.	Non placet.
Well it didn't seem so bad.	Bene non ita malum videbatur.
Which is fine.	Quod bene est.
He just didn't want to do it anymore.	Iustus amplius facere noluit.
You want to win.	Vincere vis.
I'm glad to see you.	Gaudeo te videre.
The situation is much better now.	Multo melius nunc se res habet.
Say you can't trust yourself.	Dicere potes non credere tibi.
I know you're busy.	Scio te esse occupatus.
And it has been said.	Sed et dictum est.
These things about us too.	Haec de nobis quoque.
There is none.	Ibi non est.
I just didn't want to.	Modo nolebat.
You can't have everything.	Omnia habere non potes.
That's what we are.	Id sumus.
I truly believe that.	Vere credo.
Do what you need to do.	Fac quod debes facere.
I wanted to believe.	Credere volui.
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
And we're fine.	Et bene sumus.
I don't know really.	Nescio vere.
It was not done.	Non factum est.
He thought he was there.	Putabat ibi.
I am getting so sick of it.	Questus sum ita male ab eo.
Never really appreciate.	Numquam bene vere.
It was yesterday.	Heri erat.
Which is true.	Quod verum est.
And this I love.	Et hoc amo.
Whether it was good or not, I did not know.	Utrum bonum sit necne, nesciebam.
But neither did he.	Sed nec quam.
We are better when we are together.	Melius sumus cum una sumus.
It can't be said.	Non potest, dictum est.
Let me tell you something to help you.	Dicam tibi aliquid, ut te adiuvet.
Nothing like home.	Nihil domi simile.
I just need to see it.	Ego iustus opus ad eum.
But he's not the only one who wants to be honest.	Sed non nisi sit amet velit.
I think he loves me.	Puto amat.
Don't think or don't think.	Noli cogitare vel non cogitare.
He is a boy.	Is puer est.
He came here.	Hic venit.
This day was one.	Hac die unus erat.
I don't know why.	Nescio cur.
It's not going to happen this way.	Futurum non est hoc modo.
He didn't want to do so.	Nolebat id.
But this is not enough.	Sed hoc parum est.
That's what we had with him.	Id nobis ipsum cum.
But who was before him?	Sed quis ante ipsum.
i love you as before and even more than before.	amo te ut ante et etiam plus quam ante.
He could not.	Potuit.
This is to say, still be.	Hoc est dicere, adhuc esse.
I just want to go to school.	EGO iustus volo ire ad scholam.
I don't need it.	Mihi non opus est.
never asked it.	id numquam quaesivit.
It was so.	Ita erat.
It's not a thing.	Non eam rem.
You look so much better.	Multo melius te vide.
But that's kind.	Sed id genus est.
Please do what you can.	Quaeso, fac quod potes.
I could not go there yet.	Ibi adhuc ire non potui.
That will be the same here.	Quod idem hic erit.
I don't want to see her.	Nolo eam videre.
Now	Nunc .
He thought that he knew what he wanted.	Putabat se scire quid vellet.
but in a certain way.	sed certo modo.
perhaps the whole job.	fortasse totum officium.
Which is exactly true.	Quod prorsus verum est.
And you can do nothing.	Et nihil potes.
Which is the first.	Quod primum est.
There is real work to be done.	Est verum opus faciendum.
as much as i can see.	quod multa videre possum.
But it was not said.	Sed non dictum ipsum.
You want to avoid things.	Vis ne res.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
But he does not wish.	Sed non velit.
I just feel it.	EGO iustus sentio .
It was so.	Sic erat.
But it is certain that you have many good things in the future.	Sed certum est tibi multa bona in futurum.
I do nothing.	Nihil facio.
I will do very well now.	Optime iam faciam.
See you for who you are.	Te videre pro quis es tu.
for he knew nothing.	Nihil enim sciebat.
sorry about everything.	Paenitet de omnibus.
Someone left me to think a little earlier.	Quis me cogitare paulo ante reliquit.
Me too.	Me quoque.
That's still going to happen.	Quod adhuc futurum est.
This was really bad.	Hoc vere malum esset.
That's mine.	Id meum est.
But that is before.	Sed id est ante.
And as he says.	Et ut dicit.
What do you have to say about him?	Quid habes de illo dicere?
He always has good advice.	Bonum consilium semper habet.
Stay with him.	Mane apud eum.
yes it was a lot of fun.	Etiam sit amet erat ex.
Maybe who it was.	Aliquam quis erat.
He seemed very pleased with himself.	Sibi admodum videbatur.
He always said yes to me.	Ita semper mihi dixit.
See here and here and here.	Vide hic et hic et hic.
I could not do it.	Non potui facere eum.
I am so very glad.	Ita valde gaudeo.
I never thought anything would happen between us.	Numquam putavi aliquid inter nos fore.
if he could.	si posset.
He would not, she thought.	Noluit, putavit.
He ate hardly anything.	Vix quicquam comedit.
To-morrow said some before.	Cras dictum aliquam ante.
I thought about how this would work.	Cogitavi quomodo hoc opus sit.
But it is nothing else.	Sed nihil aliud est.
No one comes after us.	Nemo post nos venit.
Maybe he's not with us anymore.	Fortasse iam non est nobiscum.
And it's okay with me.	Et bene est mecum.
I can'.	Possum'.
But he did not do this.	Quod tamen non fecit.
What it is and what it is.	Quid sit, et quid sit.
But today is not a good day.	Sed hodie non est dies bonus.
I have done this.	Hoc feci.
Maybe now or always.	Aliquam vel semper nunc.
He wanted to come.	Venire voluit.
I didn't get any out.	Ut non aliquam ex.
You should not see.	Te videre non debet.
I'm not so sure that's true.	Non ita certus sum quod verum est.
This is my job.	Hoc est officium.
We are not yet.	Non adhuc sumus.
You do this.	Vos hoc facere.
He gave me the money.	Mihi pecuniam dedit.
To not get out.	Ut non ex.
Why do you really love someone	Cur aliquis vere amo
But they are not enough.	Sed parum sunt.
You can still stay with me.	Adhuc apud me manere potes.
He did not know what it was.	Nesciebat quid esset.
Immediately after.	Mox, ad.
There was none in the game.	Nulla in erat velit.
I don't need a job.	Non opus est officium.
He did not want to hear this.	Hoc nolebat audire.
In order to do so.	Id ut in.
You know well.	Bene scis.
When you have this, you have a lot.	Cum hoc habes, multum habes.
It is not for me to understand.	Non est mihi intelligere.
I think both are necessary.	Utrumque opus esse puto.
But evil is always like evil.	Sed semper malum est sicut malum.
he refused to give his name.	nomen dare noluit.
But this was not.	Sed hoc non fuit.
and so he does.	et sic facit.
But that's how it is.	Sed id quam enim.
we are very sorry for him.	eius sumus valde.
You have one.	Habes unum.
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
I don't need anything to do.	Non necesse est mihi quid faciendum sit.
I like it here.	Hic mihi placet.
There was no such thing.	Nulla id erat.
I was so happy.	Tam felix eram.
And he knew that he wanted this more for himself.	Et sciebat hoc plus sibi velle.
I thought it was that.	id esse putavi.
I told him exactly what happened to him.	quid acciderit ei prorsus dixi.
I was a boy boy.	puer eram puer.
I think this.	Puto hoc.
I will not do it again.	Non iterum faciam.
Maybe not great.	Forte non magna.
Both of us.	Ambo nos.
She certainly did not say.	Illa certe non dixit.
That's who he was himself.	Ut quis erat ipsum.
You can tell me the truth.	Potes mihi verum dicere.
I don't know if it's true.	Nescio si verum est.
Do not speak of yourself.	Noli ex te loqui.
and when.	et cum.
He loves me.	Me amat.
She's not going to do it.	Illa non facturus est.
He has exactly this.	Is prorsus hic habet.
The man certainly was still alive.	Vir certe adhuc erat.
Where are they always?	Ubi sunt semper?.
But you can see.	Sed videre potes.
Be ready soon.	Mox paratus sit.
This is not a problem at all.	Hoc omnino non est quaestio.
That's where it was.	Ut in erat quam.
I don't feel anything.	Non sentio quicquam.
Maybe he was still alive.	Aliquam erat adhuc.
But it was time.	Sed tempus erat.
He loves there.	Ibi amat.
He was from.	Ex erat.
Ready to go?	Paratus ad ire?
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
He wanted to do the same.	Idem facere voluit.
You don't need to talk.	Dicere non opus est.
Say your name.	Dic nomen tuum.
we can't stop.	prohibere possumus.
No as of now now.	Nulla ut nunc nunc.
This was quite true.	Hoc satis verum fuit.
Don't be too sure.	Ne nimium certe sis.
This and nothing more.	Hoc, et nihil amplius.
I just want to leave.	EGO iustus volo relinquere.
i thought i could play.	posse putavi ludere.
Or not.	Vel non.
I don't like being there.	Non placet ibi.
Not sure why.	Cur non certus.
And she will do it.	Et illa facturus est.
That's what he said.	Id quod dixit.
But it was not before.	Sed non erat ante.
how late she was.	quam nuper illa fuit.
not home anymore.	Non domum suam amplius.
But not you.	Sed non tu.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
Certainly you are a man and a father.	Certe vir et pater es.
Nor does he mean anything at all.	Nec quicquam omnino vult.
Never let me talk to me.	Numquam me dicere ad me.
Well, you're getting it done now.	Bene, nunc factum es questus.
Yes that said no.	Etiam id dictum nulla.
Not so.	Non ita.
Not so.	Non ita.
It is not probable.	Probabile non est.
Now he loves, he loves.	Nunc amat amat.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
We can only be here.	Modo possumus hic esse.
That's not enough for me.	Id mihi non satis est.
This is my job.	Meum est officium.
That's what he said.	Id dixit.
he thought.	putavit.
There is no such thing as before.	Nulla id ipsum ante.
I love to hear more about this.	De hoc audire amo.
i have a plan.	habeo consilium.
You are not there.	Non ibi.
I quickly saw that he was my father.	Cito vidi quod pater meus erat.
Everything in the house.	Omnia per domum.
I just can't.	Modo non possum.
This is not true.	Ne id quidem verum est.
I did this with me.	Hoc ego feci mecum.
What really happened.	Quod vere factum est.
I don't need to talk about it.	Non opus est loqui de illo.
He does good work.	Bonum opus facit.
Do what you can.	Fac quod potes.
But he did not know how long he had.	Sed quantum temporis habuit, nesciebat.
But not as much.	Sed non quam.
He looked great.	Vidit magna.
Do a lot of fun.	Facere amet amet.
I am so you know.	Ego sum, ita scis.
This is your query.	Haec est quaestio tua.
Maybe too little.	Forte nimium parum.
Yes and no.	Etiam et nulla.
And something else.	Et aliquid aliud.
Yes, okay.	Ita, bene.
I'll do it if you'd like to do it for me.	Faciam, si me velis, facere.
There was no need that day, however.	Non opus erat illo die, sed.
I told you about it myself.	Dixi tibi de illo me.
But we're out of time.	Sed tempus ex sumus.
Or it was.	Vel erat.
i'm sure it is	Im 'certus est
We can't do this, no need.	Hoc facere non possumus nec opus est.
I hope you like it!	Spero tibi placet!.
Can't or won't.	Non potest vel non.
I don't think I'm listening.	Non videtur me audire.
Who is.	Quis est.
One man can do it.	Unus homo potest.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
But it is better in the night.	Sed melius est in nocte.
I think you understand.	Intelligere puto.
For a long time too.	Diu etiam.
I don't want to be here.	Nolo hic esse.
It is a lot, too much.	Multum est, nimis multum.
I don't know anything else.	Nescio aliud.
Probably not doing.	Probabiliter non facis.
I think I can understand both.	Puto utrumque intelligere posse.
never been and never will be.	numquam fuit et numquam erit.
This is not exactly bad.	Hoc non est prorsus malum.
I saw him.	Vidi eum.
This is almost what it was.	Hoc fere est quod fuit.
What you did wrong.	Quod male feceris.
You can only speak to me now.	Nunc solum mihi potes dicere.
You think I could help with this.	Putas me hoc posse adiuvare.
This is your job.	Hoc tuum est officium.
This is not bad.	Hoc malum non est.
I know what it is like.	Scio quid simile sit.
He didn't want us.	Noluit nos.
I thought nothing about him.	nihil de eo cogitavi.
But after the first time I have not.	Sed post primum non habeo.
Well this has been done.	Bene hoc factum est.
He said nothing.	Nihil dixit.
what do you like like?.	quid simile simile ?.
But that was how.	Sed id erat quam.
You can have it.	Habere potes.
Now I can see.	Nunc videre possum.
You are now.	Tu nunc es.
He saw her for the first time.	Vidit eam primum.
Here's what you need to do in it.	Hic, quid in eo agere non debes.
I wasn't sure what it was.	Certus non eram quod esset.
but I am.	ego tamen.
He never wants to be.	Numquam velit esse.
Everything he said he would find me.	Omnia dixit se invenire me.
Nothing more for me.	Nihil mihi amplius.
Nothing better could I find.	Nihil melius potui invenire.
Yes to you.	Ita ut te.
I could never say.	numquam dicere potui.
You don't have to do this.	Hoc facere non habes.
I am a man.	Homo sum.
It was not at all.	Erat omnino.
I don't care how bad it is.	Nolo quam malum sit.
I would not.	Nolui.
I need to see.	Videre debeo.
Maybe even before.	Aliquam vel ante.
Nothing could be done.	Fieri nihil potuit.
Or the car.	Vel currus.
I can't go to him.	Non possum ad eum ire.
This is true.	Hoc verum est.
It was late, very late.	Sero erat, multum sero.
They are mine.	In mea sunt.
Tomorrow is yours.	Cras, tua est.
Maybe it's not.	Aliquam non est.
This is enough.	Hoc satis est.
He never came home.	Numquam domum venit.
I only want this to happen.	Hoc solum volo fieri.
You can't do this.	Hoc facere non potes.
I'm not so sure about everything.	Non sum tam certus de omnibus.
He does not want to come.	Non vult venire.
for he did not know what.	quid enim nesciebat.
he said.	dixit.
Or from him.	Vel ipsum ex.
I'm glad you're coming.	Gaudeo te venire.
He could, but not.	Potuit, sed non.
I saw something more.	Plus aliquid vidi.
It is necessary to know what has happened.	Scire necesse est quid acciderit.
But they are not.	Sed non sunt.
I see what you want.	Video quid velis.
There are many.	Multa sunt.
I can't talk anymore.	Non possum amplius loqui.
It doesn't mean you can't be pretty.	Non vult satis non esse.
We all got really, really well.	Omnes obtinuit vere, vere bene.
I have done this.	Hoc ego feci.
I'm going right now.	Eo nunc.
Yes that was always.	Etiam id semper erat.
Now is the time.	Iam tempus est.
It's easy to just understand why.	Mox facile cur.
I know this indeed.	Hoc vere scio.
Nothing was done for something.	Nihil factum est aliquid.
i think it does.	puto facit.
And it was done in this way.	Factum est autem hoc modo.
If possible, today yourself.	Si fieri potest, hodie ipsum.
Nothing here, indeed.	Nihil hic quidem.
This is so quickly.	Hoc tam cito.
This was done last week.	Hoc septimana factum est.
Or not really.	Vel non vere.
But he was not to say.	Non erat autem dicere.
You just can't do anything with it.	Tu modo non potes facere quicquam cum illo.
If there is how it is possible.	Si ibi quomodo fieri potest.
This is similar.	Hoc simile est.
It was good to know.	Bonum erat scire.
It would be great for him.	Multum ei futurum esset.
Let it be only.	Sit modo.
I'm sorry I'm not sorry.	Paenitet me paenitet, non.
I was so ready to do this.	Tam paratus eram ad hoc.
For he was.	Erat enim.
Not really much.	Non vere multum.
It's yours if you want.	Tuum est si vis.
But you look too much.	Sed tu nimium vide.
It was not as hard as he thought it would be.	Non tam difficile erat quam fore putabat.
It is so hard for me.	Ita mihi difficile est.
You don't need to be friends.	Non necesse est esse amicos.
What can I see.	Quid possum videre.
And as yet.	Et ut sed.
What's wrong with her?	Quid cum illa mali?
Up to this point.	Huc usque.
sorry for not believing.	Paenitet me non credere.
I don't think we're still there.	Non puto nos adhuc ibi esse.
Nothing could persuade him.	Nihil ei persuadere potuit.
He did only what he could think of doing.	Hoc solum fecit quod facere cogitare potuit.
I heard it too.	eam quoque audivi.
See if you can know what it is.	Vide si quid sit scire potes.
That's very important to be honest.	Ut sit amet magna ipsum.
he did it.	id fecit.
Never doubt.	Nunquam dubito.
See this post today.	Hoc post hodie factum est videre.
There is no question.	Nulla quaestio est.
It was, it was.	Erat, erat.
He does the same.	Idem facit.
It's good enough for me.	Mihi satis bonum est.
Even in what he wants.	Etiam in velit quam.
What he says cannot be true.	Quod dicit verum esse non potest.
I wonder if this will happen to me soon.	Miror si hoc mihi mox erit.
It's also this thing that comes to mind.	Est etiam haec res quae occurrit.
So it is.	Ita est.
That day is not but today.	Dies ille non est hodie, sed.
So .	Sic .
That's not the same thing.	Ut non dictum ipsum.
That's pretty much it.	Id fere est.
It was with me for sure.	Apud me certe fuit.
He is now here.	Hic nunc est.
It's still not enough.	Adhuc non satis est.
I had such a good time.	Tam bonum tempus habui.
He says that he wants to see if he could.	Dicit se velle videre, si posset.
And this he did not.	Et hoc non fecit.
I tried to say.	Conatus sum dicere.
Even if it's not good for me.	Etiam si non ita est bonum ad me.
It's pretty easy to get a job.	Satis facile officium habere.
he could not stay still.	manere adhuc non potuit.
I don't want to do it again either.	Nolo id iterum vel facere.
The time has come.	Venit in tempus.
i don't know how to do it.	nescio quomodo facere.
This is enough for me.	Hoc mihi satis est.
Do not speak thus.	Noli sic loqui.
We do not have.	Non habemus.
I'll do it for you.	Faciam ut tibi.
But yet he came to the ground.	Sed tamen ad solum venit.
And he knows he can do it.	Et scit se facere posse.
Which thing indeed.	Quae quidem res.
I can't say for sure.	adhuc pro certo dicere non possum.
And there is to do.	Et sit facere.
Certainly not so much.	Certe, non tam.
i never told you.	numquam dixi tibi.
What nationality is it.	Quod genus est.
As such, this is going to happen.	Sicut sic, hoc futurum est.
He wants something here.	Hic aliquid velit.
He could say nothing to me.	Me nihil dicere potuit.
and this is another.	et hoc est aliud.
He told me so.	Dixit mihi sic.
I never started anything without it.	Numquam incepit aliquid sine illa.
In a statement.	In a dictum.
I don't need to talk.	Non opus est dicere.
To the truth.	Ad verum.
She could go on and on.	Posset ire et in.
You are one.	Tu unus es.
never was.	numquam fuit.
There was more than he said.	Plus fuit quam dixit.
Nothing more to do.	Nihil amplius facere.
I never heard of it again.	Numquam ex iterum audivi.
I had one.	unum habui.
Maybe he did it.	Fortasse fecit.
To give money.	Pecuniam dare.
Not much indeed.	Non multum quidem.
He has his job.	Habet officium suum.
He could not.	Non potuit.
It is always.	Est semper.
they are not men.	non sunt homines.
But there was no time.	Sed nec tempus erat.
but he wanted to know.	sed scire voluit.
I heard him.	Audivi eum.
It would seem that it is not.	Videtur quod non.
That would be good.	Quod bonum esset.
We'll be fine.	Bene nobis erit.
You know what it's like for us.	Tu scis quod simile nobis est.
I have seen what you have done.	Vidi quae fecisti.
There is no such thing as that.	Nulla id ipsum id.
You need to understand this.	Hoc debes intelligere.
and to make another decision.	et aliud consilium facere.
He can come with me.	Mecum venire potest.
I don't even know what this is.	Nescio quidem quid hoc sit.
We have a lot of money.	Multa pecuniae habemus.
Couldn't be without you.	Sine te non potuit.
bad and good.	Malum et bonum.
What is?	Quid est?
Look at your book.	Vide librum tuum.
It's early this morning.	Mane hoc mane est.
Appreciate you very much.	Bene tibi valde.
Like, I'm today.	Similis, me hodie.
Just me and you.	Sicut me et te.
I don't want to hear.	Nolo audire.
I had to know more.	plus scire habui.
That should be your plan.	Id tuum consilium esse debet.
Pro.	Pro .
You are with me.	Tu mecum es.
Men often, often.	Homines saepe, saepe.
I didn't do a good job with her.	Non facere quod bonum officium est eius.
He could not think.	Non potuit cogitare.
We have nothing to do with it.	Nihil habemus ad rem.
I don't plan on anything else.	Non cogitas aliud.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
That seems bad, isn't it?	Quod malum videtur, annon?
Say yes to the matter.	Etiam rem dicere.
It's time to say it was.	Aliquam ut dictum erat.
It's yours now.	Tuum est nunc.
People are still there.	Homines usque ibi sunt.
None of it is.	Nulla a est.
But no one told me everything.	Sed nemo ad me omnia.
I don't know, maybe I could do something.	Nescio, fortasse aliquid facere potuit.
You can see through yourself.	Per te ipsum videre potes.
This is exactly where I need it.	Hoc prorsus ubi opus sit.
You can't stop something like that.	Non potes prohibere aliquid simile.
You go to her.	Tu ad eam.
I don't like him.	Non amo illum.
he would not come.	venire noluit.
Please? 	Quaeso?
He said he wasn't quite sure.	Dixit se non satis certo habere.
He doesn't like us well.	Non vult nobis bene.
He doesn't want to talk.	Loqui non vult.
Or well.	Vel bene.
What's the matter with you.	Quae res est tibi.
He says something, he says something.	Aliquid dicit, aliquid dicit.
That is not true.	Id non est verum.
I don't know when.	id est nescio quando.
I can hardly think.	Vix cogitare possum.
He always had no idea what to do.	Nesciebat facere semper.
You can see these here and here .	Haec hic et hic videre potes .
He said that.	Dixit quod.
Don't believe it's better to buy.	Noli melius credere emere.
I've never seen him.	Nunquam eum vidi.
She saw me.	Illa me vidit.
But he forgot his name.	Sed nomen oblitus est.
I just really wasn't myself.	Ego iustus vere non erat ipse.
Do what you want from this.	Fac quod vis ex hoc.
You should listen.	Audire debes.
I am not you.	Non sum tu.
it is not yet done.	nondum factum est.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
yes it is not said.	Etiam non dictum est.
i tried to think through.	cogitare conatus sum per.
to him all that I said.	ei omnia quae dixi.
I can't see what it is.	Nec videre possum quid sit.
Well, maybe it's true.	Bene fortasse verum est.
In that period only.	In id tempus nisi.
And he had more.	Plus quoque habuit.
I need to know.	Scire debeo.
Maybe not for you, but for me.	Forsitan non tibi, sed mihi.
This has just been said.	Hoc modo dictum est.
you said before.	ante dixisti.
And why not.	Et cur non.
Look at this.	Hoc vide.
You need to make this decision.	Hoc consilium debes facere.
How do you do this?	Quomodo hoc facis?
Now to your room.	Nunc ad cubiculum tuum.
No that's great right now.	Nulla id magna nunc.
I hope we play a lot.	Spero nos multum ludere.
I have nothing.	Nihil habeo.
Yes! 	Ita!
my father got it.	pater obtinuit.
Both are fine with me.	Mecum bene est utrumque.
Not long yet.	Non diu tamen.
No one did it.	Nemo fecit.
You just sit like that.	Te solum sit ut est.
And her father was at home.	Et pater eius domi fuit.
The first time he met.	Primum occurrit.
He is a boy.	Is puer est.
No, he thought.	Non, putabat.
But no one says anything.	Sed nemo aliquid dicit.
This is the first time.	Hoc primum est.
It's hard to say why he didn't.	Cur non fecerit, difficile est dicere.
He has.	Habet.
And this is all.	Et hoc totum est.
He does nothing.	Nihil facit.
It's not until next week.	Proxima septimana non est.
It would seem that he wanted to speak.	Videtur quod loqui vellet.
He is from within.	Ipse ex in.
What he wanted.	Quid vellet.
Your family always does.	Tuum genus semper facit.
I am still in this way.	Ego tamen hoc modo.
But it was still enough.	Sed adhuc satis erat.
I don't want to see anything.	Nolo aliquid videre.
I'm quite happy with that.	Sum satis felix cum illo.
Tell me just when you'd like to travel.	Dic modo cum iter velis.
No one can hear us.	Nemo nos audire potest.
I'll tell you that.	Dicam illud.
the boy asked.	quaesivit puer.
I don't see anything else they can say.	Non video aliud posse dicere.
I think we're doing this together.	Puto nos hoc unum facere.
It is one thing.	Aliud est.
No one knows except through me.	Nemo scit nisi per me.
It was, however.	Erat tamen.
There is one thing.	Unum est.
Its good to hear from you.	Bonum suum a te audire.
I just don't know.	Modo nescio.
You do not want.	Non vis.
i'm too hard.	Im 'difficile est'.
Don't tell me.	Noli mihi narrare.
He comes to dinner.	Venit ad cenam.
He knows everything about him.	Scit omnia de eo.
I tried to think of something else.	Conatus est aliquid aliud cogitare.
This is what you should always do.	Hoc est quod debes facere semper.
It is not good.	Non bonum.
Maybe you don't need it.	Fortasse non opus est.
And it is good.	Et bonum est.
How did he do it?	Quomodo fecit?
Yes, this is a great time.	Etiam sit amet tempus magna.
That's fine.	Bene illud.
You cannot come.	Venire non potes.
He was my boy.	Meus erat puer.
If there is one.	Si ibi est.
He was very sorry.	Erat valde.
But that's just as important.	Sed ut magna id est.
You know what's going to happen.	Scis quid futurum sit.
that is all.	id est omnia.
I hope you understand what I want.	Spero te intelligere, quod volo.
To me it is so.	Mihi quidem sic est.
But he was also himself.	Sed et ipsum erat.
Which seems to be an evil.	Quod malum esse videtur.
There was no time for that.	Nulla id tempus erat.
This is not true.	Hic non.
And this he could understand.	Et hoc intelligere potuit.
Nothing can stop us now.	Nihil nunc nos prohibere potest.
Too late for this purpose.	Sero ad hanc rem.
So it is.	Ita est.
This is not for me to say.	Hoc non est mihi dicere.
That is only.	Id est solum.
All you really need is a boy.	Omnes vere opus est puer.
I said with certainty.	Certo dixi.
You can say your own.	Potes dicere tuum esse.
I don't believe it's going to be kind.	Genus futurum non credo.
And yet nothing.	Et tamen nihil.
Tell me why you're here.	Dic mihi cur hic sis.
it is up to you.	id est ad vos.
Many, many things.	Multa, multa.
We don't need anymore.	Non opus est nobis amplius.
He wanted what he did.	Voluit quod fecit.
no one asked.	nemo quaesivit.
He made some money last year.	Pecuniam aliquam proximo anno fecit.
Not enough has been done.	Parum est factum.
as required.	Quod erat faciendum.
All right.	Recte omnia.
Maybe it's good.	Fortasse bonum est.
Maybe this has been done.	Forsitan id factum est.
They don't even exist.	Ne quidem sunt.
You can say nothing.	Nihil potes dicere.
He does not know.	Nescit.
not how you got it.	Non quomodo obtinuit.
I love this video.	Hoc amo video.
I want to be like her.	Volo esse sicut eius.
But there was a need.	Sed opus erat.
but he did nothing.	sed nihil fecit.
I will speak in this way.	Dicam hoc modo.
make a decision.	consilium fac.
And probably not.	Et verisimile non est.
It's not.	Suus 'non.
That's why.	Id cur.
But he did not.	Sed non fecit.
i want to do this.	ut hoc volo.
The same is true.	Simile est illud verum.
Why not?	Cur non?
It's time to save time.	Aliquam sit amet tempus nisi.
yes or no than that.	Etiam vel nulla quam.
You're my problem.	Quaestio mihi es.
There should be no school today.	Hodie schola non debet esse.
he said that he did not know why he did it.	dixit se nescire quare id fecerit.
You're good to me, you know.	Tu bonus es mihi, tu scis.
That's another story.	Id aliud.
I really wanted this work.	Hoc opus vere volui.
But I don't like it enough.	Sed non satis placet.
yes or no.	Etiam vel erat nulla.
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
This is what I plan to do to you.	Hoc est quae non cogitas ut te.
It is important to say please.	Aliquam sit amet dictum velit.
It is not easy.	Non facile.
Which indeed has been done.	Quod quidem factum est.
That's what he does.	Eius quod facit.
It was something else entirely.	Aliud omnino fuit.
Those who are here are here.	Qui hic sunt, hic sunt.
Just by yourself.	Modo per ipsum.
Good thing	Bona res.
He said that enough was enough for him.	Satis sibi satis esse dixit.
There it was.	Ibi fuit.
He was my father.	Ille pater meus erat.
To be very happy always.	Ut sit amet ipsum semper.
I would not live without him.	Sine eo vivere nolui.
Everyone seemed to enjoy it.	Videbatur omnes habere.
So it was all.	Sic erat omnia.
It is not true.	Non est verum.
He was thirty.	Triginta erat.
You need to do something.	Facere aliquid debes.
I want to come again.	Iterum venire volo.
He told us.	Dixit nobis.
And now he was here.	Et nunc hic erat.
better than you should know.	melius quam scire debes.
It's how I tried.	Factum est quomodo conatus sum.
Nor was it.	Nec erat.
But at least he would do it.	Sed certe id faceret.
I'm almost sick.	Fere male sum.
And it was almost time.	Erat autem fere tempus.
He was there yesterday.	Heri erat ibi.
He seemed a good man.	Vir bonus videbatur.
But it was, but it was.	Sed erat, sed erat.
I'm trying to find another job.	Ego aliud officium invenire conatur.
It's not that bad.	Non est id malum.
It was very good for me.	Fuit mihi valde bonus.
He is just a guy.	Iustus est guy.
got it.	Obtinuit.
It's just a matter of trying to do it.	Suus 'iustus rem facere conatur.
It's that indeed.	Est id quidem.
Not that either.	Non quod vel.
It looks all the time.	Spectat omnes tempus.
But perhaps he just asked poorly.	Sed fortasse modo male quaesivit.
Everything with me.	Quae mecum.
Not too bad, really.	Non etiam malum, vere.
Time.	Tempus.
To speak and to speak.	Loqui et loqui.
Good day	Bonus dies.
That he was not.	Ut non erat.
If not, say so.	Si non, dic ita.
Soon it would not be enough.	Mox satis non esset.
I like you.	Placet tibi.
That's very important to be honest.	Ut sit amet magna ipsum.
There is.	Ibi est.
Yes it's out.	Etiam eam ex.
I love you all!	Omnes amo!.
This has been done before.	Hoc ante factum est.
What about him?	Quid de illo?.
Which would be true.	Quod verum esset.
Must have one.	Debet habere unum.
Don't be too sure about it.	Noli nimium esse certus de illo.
It would not be in the morning.	Mane non esset.
He was very prepared.	Erat paratus valde.
I hope it looks everything.	Spero quod spectat omnia.
I don't like this at all.	Hoc omnino non placet.
We're here after you.	Nos hic post te.
Maybe you need to go there and do it.	Forsitan opus est ire illuc et facere.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Non sum certus quomodo hoc faciam.
I want him.	Eum volo.
I will speak again.	Iterum dicam.
You don't have a lot of time.	Et non multum temporis.
Tomorrow is	Cras est.
I just like it.	Modo ut sit.
But he cannot have this.	Sed hoc habere non potest.
Most likely never will.	Verisimile nunquam erit.
I don't quite know how to do it.	Non satis scio quomodo id facias.
I am not sure about you.	Non sum certus de te.
He did what he did.	Fecit quod fecit.
And he did not know.	Et ipse nesciebat.
You have yourself.	Tu ipse habes.
But he was in that.	Sed in erat quam.
An evil thing.	An malum est.
I don't want to be.	Nolo me esse.
There was no problem.	Quaestio non fuit.
Never after him.	Numquam post illum.
I know this to be true.	Scio hoc verum esse.
I have better advice.	Melius consilium habeo.
There was no need for this.	Hic non erat opus.
This is something else entirely.	Aliud omnino hoc est.
And he had both.	Et habuit utrumque.
Here we have a question.	Hic habemus quaestionem.
He thought, perhaps he said so.	Putavit fortasse ita ut dixit.
It's you and you know.	Est tibi, et scis.
It doesn't look good.	Is vultus bonus non est.
Even if he thinks this, he never told it.	Etiam si hoc putat, numquam indicavit.
Please allow me.	Sine me quaeso.
It was time.	Tempus erat.
He inquired why.	Quaesivit quare.
He could not do this.	Hoc facere potuit.
I just couldn't see him.	Modo eum videre non potui.
not as per se.	Non quod per se.
And he wanted to do well.	Et bene facere voluit.
Make it easy for you.	Fac tibi facile.
Soon I'm not sure.	Mox Is.
He did not want to be seen.	Noluit videri.
But to me.	Mihi autem.
I was very happy to stay there.	Valde felix ibi mane.
It's almost okay.	Bene fere est.
I can't say never do it.	Non possum dicere numquam facere.
Look what he did to you.	Vide quid fecerit tibi.
Here before.	Hic ante.
he came into the council.	in consilium venit.
I do not have.	Non habeo.
Now no one wants to.	Nunc a velit nulla.
That which is seen.	Illud, quod videtur.
What is.	Quid est.
But that's how it is.	Sed id ipsum quam.
And he went with someone.	Abiit quoque cum aliquo.
This is not something.	Hoc non est aliquid.
Ready.	Paratus.
so I'll tell you well.	ut bene tibi dicam.
Look out for yourself now.	Nunc de te vide.
We don't really know.	Nos non vere scio.
.	.
Here you are.	Hic tu.
It is better to do it easily for me.	Melius est, ut facile in me faciam.
No, not.	Non, non.
There is no such thing as ever.	Nulla ut semper est.
Never let me down.	Numquam me.
They don't do anything.	Non sunt aliquid.
My work is not hard.	Mihi opus non est difficile.
I will tell you.	Dicam tibi.
He was also alone.	Etiam solus erat.
He ought to be himself.	Se ipsum esse debet.
What things	Quae res.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
The man looks at you.	Vir te spectat.
It is mine.	Mea est.
I would like to be satisfied.	Satis vellem.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
he says to come tomorrow.	cras dicit venire.
There was nothing wrong.	Nihil mali fuit.
It was really good.	Erat vere bona.
But it won't be long.	Sed non diu erit.
But not long after.	Sed nec multo post.
Maybe he's the only one who is good.	Forsitan solus bonus.
I can see you there.	Ibi videre possum.
That time.	Tempus illud.
I need to think about it.	Mihi opus est de hoc cogitare.
It's hard to believe she's not here.	Difficile est credere illa hic non est.
but you do this.	sed hoc tu facis.
As someone said please.	Ut quis dictum velit.
But it is time to do so.	Sed tempus velit id.
Only do your work.	Tantum fac opus tuum.
I will do this thing.	hanc rem facturus sum.
Tell me later.	Dic post me.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Again perhaps.	Iterum fortasse.
If this	Si hoc.
I just can't help anymore.	Modo non possum amplius.
He comes to me.	Venit ad me.
He wanted to know that he was his wife.	Scire voluit uxorem suam esse.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
It wasn't much different.	Non multum aliud fuit.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
And really sorry for you.	Et vere paenitet tibi.
All is well.	Omnia bene.
did not succeed.	Non obtinuit.
And here he seems to be there.	Et hic videtur esse ibi.
He has my lunch.	Prandium meum non habet.
Play through them.	Ludere per illa.
The question is when.	Quaestio quidem est quando.
If we are here, we are here.	Si hic sumus, hic sumus.
But it was not time itself, it was not time.	Sed non tempus ipsum, non tempus erat.
But no one knows.	Sed nemo scit.
What does he think at last?	Quid tandem cogitat?
I have done nothing wrong.	Nihil mali feci.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Forsitan dies unus, sed nondum.
Yes, as a whole, really.	Ita, ut totum est, vere.
He thought about me.	Putabat de me.
You know what you mean.	Scis vis.
I don't have enough time.	Non satis temporis.
I had a name.	nomen habui.
I just wasn't late.	Modo non sero fuit.
Not just people.	Non solum homines.
As you said, happy day is today.	Sicut dixisti, felix dies est hodie.
what i am not going to do.	quod ego non sum facturus.
I can understand how it was done.	quomodo factum sit intelligere possum.
I don't have it going.	Non habet id eat.
You can do something else.	Aliud facere potes.
Would definitely stay again.	Certe manere iterum.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est verum.
Now was not the time.	Nunc nec tempus erat.
He would not do this.	Hoc facere noluit.
I don't know what nationality.	Nescio quid genus.
He said not all things indeed.	Non omnia quidem dixit.
No help on time, at least.	Auxilium non in tempore, certe.
But this is one thing.	Sed hoc unum est.
Perhaps if only she told him.	Forsitan si modo indicavit ei .
I have to play.	Habeo ludere.
Now it won't be too much.	Nunc non nimis erit.
I don't really know what to say.	Non vere scio quid dicam.
Not sure what's up.	Non certus quid usque.
I don't know much about that moment.	Nescio multum de illo tempore.
He could, but did not.	Potuit, sed non fecit.
It was not for us.	Non erat nobis.
Maybe it was a.	Aliquam erat a.
It's too easy to be good.	Bonum nimis facile est.
For me, it does even better.	Pro me, hoc etiam melius facit.
I don't know who you like.	Nescio quis similis.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
Not for you.	Non tibi.
I'm not there just	Non sum ibi sicut .
We don't need it.	Non opus est nobis.
It used to be.	Non esse solebat.
One week is one week.	Una septimana est una septimana.
He was not.	Non erat.
But neither was he before.	Sed nec ante erat.
Not a real evil.	Non verum malum.
This man is.	Hic homo est.
I feel this.	Hoc sentio.
It's not a good race.	Non est bonum genus.
He can deal with me.	Me agere potest.
He said it was not time to talk.	Dixit loqui tempus non esse.
That was the only way to do it.	Ut id erat nisi.
And you always do it.	Semper id et tu.
He was not good.	Nec erat bene.
He was a man, save what he knew.	Vir erat, nisi quod sciebat.
I need this more.	Hoc opus est mihi plus.
I didn't think.	Non putavi.
No more.	Non amplius.
all at once.	Omnes simul.
AND THE FATHER	ET PATER.
There's no way to do it yet.	Nulla id facere ut sed.
Not when.	Non cum.
But that's no right now.	Sed id nulla nunc.
Everyone needs to do their job.	Omnibus opus suum facere officium.
Tonight was good.	Hac nocte bonum esset.
He was a good man.	Erat bonus.
Look what I have.	Habeo quod vide.
He speaks in the text.	Loquitur in illud.
Probably does.	Verisimiliter facit.
I'm sorry.	Paenitet.
You can do that.	Quod facere potes.
Take a look here.	Vide hic, ut.
Who knows what happened?	Quis scit quid factum sit.
He left the room.	Cubiculum reliquit.
Yes, please.	Etiam, velit.
Without it, you can't do it.	Sine, non potes facere.
We can't go anywhere today.	Huc ire non possumus hodie.
To what and where it was.	Ut quid et ubi esset.
And he ought not to go thither.	Et illuc ire non debet.
She could say this to him.	Posset hoc ei dicere.
than never.	quam numquam.
He thought that would be good.	Quod bonum esset, putabat.
I don't know what you really want.	Nescio quid vere.
And truly it is.	Et vere est.
If it will be, it will be.	Si suus erit, erit.
You have money.	Pecuniam habes.
if you can find one.	si unum invenire potes.
He's here tonight.	Hic hac nocte est.
It is not what he says.	Non est quod dicit.
If you do what you do, that is fine.	Si facere quod tibi facit, id est bene.
No, not.	Non, non.
This is all I need to do.	Hoc mihi opus est omnibus facere.
Now do it quickly.	Nunc cito fac.
He would not see him.	Noluit videre eum.
Everything would be like that.	Omnia fore ut.
I think this is true.	Hoc verum puto.
They are good with him.	Bona sunt cum illo.
No one knows.	Nemo scit.
Too busy to get out today.	Nimis occupatus ut hodie de.
But as it is.	Sed ut est est.
Probably just me.	Probabiliter tantum me.
I'm just a job.	Im 'iustus officium.
She must be at home now.	Domi iam esse debet.
But it was not enough.	Sed parum fuit.
i know it's possible.	scio posse.
It was, indeed.	Erat, vere.
Too soon?.	Nimis cito ?.
He has no friends.	Hic amicos non habet.
I see the problem.	quaestionem video.
But I don't like what you think.	Sed non placet quod cogitas.
I don't talk much.	Non multa loqui.
Really, really good.	Vere, vere bonum est.
It has nothing to do with you.	Nihil ad te habet.
You have done so much for me.	Tantum fecisti mihi.
Why her? 	Cur eam?
I do this often.	Hoc saepe facio.
Now, it doesn't seem great to me.	Nunc, non magna mihi videtur.
I hope it will be out next time.	Spero fore ex proximo tempore.
I don't know whether this will work again.	Nescio an hoc etiam opus erit.
By doing so.	Id per.
I do exactly this.	Prorsus hoc facio.
I hope to talk to you again soon.	Spero mox iterum loqui tecum.
It was done quickly.	Cito factum est.
I have not seen.	non vidi.
There seemed to be no happiness.	Non videbatur ibi esse felix.
This one does not have.	Hoc unum non habet.
He knew how to do it.	Scivit facere.
But that was great.	Sed id erat magna.
There will be no school.	Schola non erit.
And that is good.	Et illud bonum est.
There's no great thing in it.	Nulla in magna ipsum.
You are not thinking correctly.	Non recte cogitas.
But there was also time.	Sed et tempus erat.
The same is true today.	Idem hodie verum est.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
I don't know.	Non me scio.
I saw him for the first time.	Eum primum vidi.
It is done.	Factum est.
He did what he did.	Fecit quod fecit.
I plan to win.	Vincere cogitavi.
He loves him.	Amat eum.
It will not be easy.	Facile non erit.
But they are not the same.	Sed non sunt ipsum.
Well, rightly so.	Bene, recte.
No one wanted it.	Nemo eam voluit.
We have a lot to do.	Multum habemus facere.
It's never enough.	Numquam satis est.
You can't do everything at once.	Non potes omnia simul facere.
It is already done.	Iam factum est.
I can't see this.	Non possum hoc videre.
We can do this kind.	Hoc genus possumus.
I wasn't sure if this was the case.	Certus eram si hoc esset.
Maybe, he said.	Forsitan, ille.
He wants to talk to you.	Loqui tecum vult.
I never saw it.	Numquam vidit.
There was nothing but time.	Erat nec nisi tempus.
I don't know how it's happened.	Nescio quomodo acciderit.
There was nothing new.	Nihil erat novi.
You need to know.	Scire debes.
You have years and years.	Habes annos et annos.
It will be better.	Melius sic erit.
But he did not say.	Sed non dixit.
You can know.	Scire potes.
I haven't tried it.	Non quod conatus est.
It might not be that much.	Non quod multum posset.
He could not.	Potuit.
Don't see me again.	Noli me iterum videre.
And so also.	Ita et.
If not then	Si non erit.
I love it.	Illud amo.
I think that's very good.	Puto quod valde bonum est.
i have what i need.	habeo quod opus est.
You never know.	Numquam tu.
This one is enough.	Hoc unum satis est.
I don't know what to do.	Nescio, quid hoc facere.
I wonder if I could come here.	Miror, si posset te huc venire.
You can do nothing.	Nihil potes.
You are among your friends.	Tu inter amicos es.
Soon he left it.	Mox reliquit id.
what i can say.	quod possum dicere.
No one is seen.	Nemo videtur.
Well, there is only one.	Bene, unum tantum est.
I thought perhaps.	Cogitavi fortasse.
You can think of me however you want.	De me tamen vis cogitare potes.
Now I can hear.	Nunc audire possum.
I don't doubt you.	Non dubito te.
This could be done.	Fieri hic potuit.
You go for it.	Tu pro illo.
the boy was sick.	male erat puer.
Or perhaps.	Vel fortasse.
You are.	Tu es.
Do good.	Bonum fac.
We can hear everything.	Omnia possumus audire.
Do this for yourself.	Fac hoc tuum.
for I am indeed.	vere enim sum.
You have to get in now.	Modo ut habes in.
He comes to me.	Venit ad me.
I'm almost the only one who ever does.	Non sum fere solus qui semper facit.
You can go on and on.	Potes ire et in et in.
But this is not enough.	Sed hoc parum est.
This is the same thing.	Idem hic est.
I hope this is better.	Hoc spero melius.
For never.	Numquam enim.
I feel right.	Recte sentio.
But yes, that's very important.	Etiam sed ipsum quam.
And that's what this is about.	Et id est quis hic fere.
I am not that man.	Non sum ille homo.
Well done.	Bene fecit.
That's never been done before.	Id numquam ante.
It was always his name.	Semper eius nomen fuit.
But this is his name.	Sed hoc est nomen eius.
He says that he knows.	Dicit se scire.
This was not true.	Hoc non fuit.
Which indeed is so.	Quod quidem ita est.
Maybe not but nothing.	Aliquam non nisi nisi.
Maybe that was the game.	Aliquam erat id velit.
And this same thing.	Et hoc idem.
He wanted it very much.	Valde id voluit.
Now it's a great idea.	Nunc a est magna.
Now that's the same thing.	Nunc id dictum ipsum.
But that advice is one good thing.	Consilium autem illud est unum bonum.
He is gone too.	Abiit etiam.
And nothing else.	Et nihil aliud.
I don't want to see him do it.	Non vis videre eum facere.
The father himself willed it for himself.	Pater ipse sibi voluit.
But see.	Sed vide.
The boy knows what to say.	Quid dicam puer nescit.
I didn't know what to do.	Nesciebam quid.
You are not.	Non es.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
You're there.	Es ibi.
It's too bad.	Nimium malum est.
I just want someone to believe.	Ego iustus volo aliquem credere.
which he could do for much longer.	quod multo diutius facere potuit.
It is for sure.	Est certe.
Mine is similar.	Meum est simile.
We don't need it.	Non opus est nobis.
I thought.	Cogitavi.
He likes to do so.	Velit id.
It is certain.	Certum est.
Nothing pleases me too much.	Nihil nimium placet.
The man is the teacher.	Vir magister est.
Always late, never ready.	Semper sero, numquam paratus.
Why can't we do something.	Cur aliquid possumus.
It is important to be great.	Aliquam sit amet magna est.
I didn't think so.	Non putabam.
But you can understand.	Sed intelligere potes.
I don't want to hurt.	Nolo malum.
This is only for me.	Hoc tantum est mihi.
Tell her what happened.	Dic ei quod factum est.
He did that as a child.	Se fecit, ut puer.
I can see him now.	Eum nunc videre possum.
It's been a journey.	Iter suus fuit.
Be kind to yourself.	Esse genus ad te.
This shouldn't be much.	Hoc non multum debet esse.
I can't believe	Non possum credere.
There are many of us.	Multa sunt nobis.
You don't need to be alone with me.	Solus non debes esse mecum.
he did not do more.	non fecit amplius.
This ain't nothing.	Hoc non est nihil.
I never met one.	Numquam occurrit unum.
It could not be.	Non potuit esse.
And I did not.	Et non feci.
It is good for him.	Bonum est ei.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I know it's time for us to talk.	Scio tempus est nobis loqui.
Which he did very well.	Quod optime fecit.
I don't know how that's happened.	Nescio quomodo id acciderit.
Do as you want.	Fac sicut vis.
A job and a job.	A officium et officium.
Now you can't understand.	Nunc intelligere non potes.
It does not appear.	Nec videtur.
I hope, not yet.	spero, non tamen.
perhaps more than that.	fortasse quam.
Right, you said.	Recte, dixisti.
He did it for me.	Pro me fecit.
And you look great.	Et vide magna.
Well I can tell you.	Bene tibi dicere possum.
I am still in it.	adhuc in eo sum.
It is not likely.	Verisimile non est.
But nothing here.	Nihil hic autem.
I'm doing this.	Hoc me facere.
He knows.	Scit.
Truly I am not.	Vere non sum.
Well, maybe he did.	Bene, fortasse fecit.
You can't work again.	Opus non potes iterum.
i love you	te amo
But no one else is better.	Sed non est aliud melius.
I wasn't really sure.	Ego vere certus non erat.
However, he did not give.	Tamen non dedit.
no one knows where he is.	nemo scit ubi sit.
I have seen you.	Vidi te.
No one will likely.	Verisimile nemo erit.
He was always for us.	Semper erat pro nobis.
Well here's what he says.	Bene hic est quod dicit.
Is good.	Bonus est.
It is bad enough.	Malum satis est.
In this way.	Eo modo.
He did good work on it.	Bonum opus ex eo fecit.
Not the same.	Non ipsum.
That was for him.	Quod ad ipsum erat.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
It's something else.	Est aliquid aliud.
Nothing from that time	Nihil ex eo tempore.
She did not know what her father was.	Nesciebat quid pater suus esset.
OK to do something.	Bene esse aliquid.
Now we have no time for him.	Nunc tempus ipsum non habemus.
Tell her what is to be done.	Dic ei quid faciendum sit.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
I don't know why.	Nescio quod.
I wanted to tell you.	Dicere volui tibi.
he wanted to stay out.	de manere voluit.
which was enough.	quam satis erat.
Tomorrow is important.	Cras sit amet.
You can know where he is, but not where he is going.	Scire potes ubi sit, sed non quo eat.
I think he is very sad.	Nimis ipse puto.
Better for us all.	Melius nobis omnes.
It's not so hard.	Non ita difficile est.
It has it all.	Sic habet omnes.
Perhaps the situation is the same for both.	Forsitan ita se res habet ad utrumque.
I hope it's not for you.	Spero quod non est in te.
What time do you plan to get there?.	Quo tempore cogitas illuc ?.
What is to be done.	Quid sit quod faciendum est.
But it is better.	Sed melius est.
It's not hard for me.	Non est difficile mihi.
It didn't seem like it was a bad thing.	Hoc non erat simile videri malum.
It was not done.	Non factum est.
You are here now.	Hic nunc es.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum ut.
Which is not so.	Quod non ita est.
So it is.	Ita est.
Well, I never seemed to want much.	Bene, numquam multum velle videbatur.
But, it was done.	Sed, factum est.
Everything is still, now.	Omnia adhuc, nunc.
I never really have time.	Numquam vere tempus.
It will be enough time.	Is erit satis dies.
Let the only work be done by me.	Sit solum opus a me factum.
I wish you the best.	Optime vellem.
And not for tomorrow.	Cras nec enim.
He is gone.	Abiit.
It looked different.	Aliud videbatur.
Let's be honest.	Sit amet sit amet.
You never know why.	Quae numquam cur.
i'm not there yet.	adhuc non sum ibi.
We are not men.	Non sumus homines.
But he wants you to understand this.	Sed hoc intelligere te vult.
Great email.	Magna quis.
I like you all.	Ego amo te omnia.
I wanted to be done.	fieri volui.
He wanted to think about this for a long time.	De hoc voluit diu cogitare.
You're this good.	Hoc bonum es tu.
But these things are temporary only.	Sed haec ad tempus tantum.
Where no one could see.	Ubi nemo videre potuit.
Or a plan.	Vel consilium.
Yes it is, that is true.	Ita est, id est verum.
I couldn't be more wrong indeed.	non potui plus mali quidem.
And thus it is difficult to overcome.	Et sic difficile est vincere.
You have what you have.	Habes quod habes.
He said that he had.	Dixit se habere.
And so he.	Sic et ille.
or you?	an tu?.
We can speak of him.	de eo loqui possumus.
I wonder if it will be the same.	Miror si idem erit?.
Very good.	Ipsum bonum.
It is not so true.	Non ita est verum.
You are my boy.	Puer meus es.
Nothing is nothing.	Nulla res nulla est.
More than he wants.	Plus quam velit.
Maybe that's.	Fortasse id.
We however.	Nos autem.
Tell me not this.	Dic mihi non hoc.
That was the only thing I would do.	Erat unum id non facturum.
i never knew until recently.	numquam scivi, usque nuper.
I didn't know anything.	Nesciebam aliquid.
I see what you're getting.	Video quid questus es.
What can it be?	Quid potest esse?
That's something for sure.	Quod certe aliquid est.
It is certain.	Certum est.
To his house	Ad domum suam .
i get you one.	ego te unum.
i want her here.	eam hic volo.
I feel so happy that she loves me.	Sentio tam felix ut me amat.
I just wanted a dog.	Canem modo volui.
I need to go.	Ire debeo.
I don't want him to come.	Nolo illum venire.
it's enough for all.	satis omnibus est.
It's behind us.	Est post nos.
He's here to stay.	Hic manere hic est.
But I don't like it.	Sed non placet.
The race does not appear.	Genus non videtur.
My guy won't talk to you.	Meus guy non loqui tibi.
He was not here.	Hic non erat.
I would not hear any more.	Nolui amplius audire.
That was his job.	Quod eius officium fuit.
She'll be better.	Illa melius erit.
he knows when he is.	scit, quando est.
In time itself.	In tempus ipsum.
But now enough.	Sed nunc satis.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
I don't know how long.	Nescio quam diu.
He seems to have done well.	Bene fecisse videtur.
Not for me.	Non mihi.
You are sure.	Certus es.
but they are there.	sed sunt ibi.
This is true of all things.	Quod quidem spectat ad omnia.
But the time is like before.	Sed tempus est ut ante.
i love it a lot.	quod multum amo.
Only a dog.	Canem tantum.
I can't be certain.	Certum esse non possum.
He was that kind of guy.	Erat id genus guy.
In this he was himself.	In id erat ipsum.
But that's not good now.	Sed ut bonum non est nunc.
I want to be here.	hic esse volo.
It's not.	Suus 'non.
I'm sorry to see you.	Me paenitet te videre.
What you do, things.	Quid facias, res.
I think it would be very likely.	Verisimile puto fore.
His job is to do this.	Suum officium est hoc facere.
But he got nothing at all.	Sed nihil prorsus obtinuit.
Nothing is without me.	Nihil sine me esse.
And do it again.	Et fac iterum.
Police said no.	Aliquam non dictum nulla.
But it seems good.	Sed bonum videtur.
Things are not great right now.	Quae non magna nunc.
It was another thing too.	Aliud quoque erat.
You are at home.	Domi es.
i never heard it.	numquam id audivi.
People are evil.	Homines malum.
I doubt alone.	Solus dubito.
This is enough.	Hoc satis est.
Here's what to do in time.	Hic quis ut tempore facere.
You can't see him.	Eum videre non potes.
We are very sorry.	Valde sumus.
That's how he played it.	Ut id ipsum quam.
Maybe he did it.	Fortasse fecit.
He didn't know what was going on anymore.	Nesciebat quid esset amplius.
So no one can see you.	Ita nemo te videre potest.
I have tried.	Conatus sum.
Someone can do what they like.	Potest aliquis facere quod placet.
It was easy.	Facile.
Not as yet.	Non ut sed tamen.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Noluit loqui mihi.
not just yet.	non id solum tamen.
That was not bad.	Id malum non fuit.
He said .	Dixit .
Maybe it was.	Aliquam erat.
You must do this.	Hoc facere debes.
He just wants from all	Ille iustus vult ab omnibus .
No one tried to stop me.	Nemo me prohibere conatus est.
He thought he knew.	Putabat se scire.
better than we can.	melius quam possumus.
I am too scared.	ego quoque vix.
I know you're there.	Scio te ibi esse.
I don't doubt it.	Ita non dubito.
This is!	Hic est!
Not for us, but.	Non nobis, sed.
It is likely there too.	Verisimile est etiam ibi.
I don't like it that way.	Hoc modo mihi non placet.
I could not speak.	Non potui loqui.
You're not just there.	Non solum te ibi.
I tried to help her.	Conatus est eam adiuvare.
To go with something that's what you fight for.	Ut cum aliquid, id quod pro.
I can't be right, at least not yet.	Non possum recte, certe nondum.
You can do it alone.	Bene facere potes id solum.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
All you need to do to help me.	Omnia debes facere ut me adiuvet.
I know.	Scio.
But he barely told it.	Sed vix indicavit.
This got it.	Hoc obtinuit.
There is no time in which.	Nulla in nunc quam.
He knows nothing, it seems.	Nihil scit, videtur.
Even before it was not.	Etiam non ante erat.
She wanted me to go home with her.	Voluit me domum ire cum illa.
Yes, it was not as it was.	Etiam non erat ut erat.
If nothing else, that is.	Si nihil est aliud, id est.
It was really bad.	Malum erat vere.
No one has.	Nemo habet.
If you can't, you can find it here.	Si non potes, hic invenire potes.
Never let you down.	Nunquam te in.
This was a journey.	Hoc erat iter.
I hope all is well.	Bene spero.
There she thought again.	Ibi iterum putavit.
But for him.	Sed in ipsum enim.
This could not have been done.	Hoc fieri non potuit.
I'll tell you when.	Dicam tibi quando.
Now we can find nothing here.	Nunc nihil hic invenire possumus.
Nothing else, really.	Nihil aliud, vere.
It's not hard to understand why.	Non est difficile intelligere quare.
Yes, he said great things.	Ita est, magna dixit.
He still has.	Habet adhuc.
It looks real good.	Spectat verum bonum.
Yes.	Etiam.
I believe we are coming there.	Credo nos illuc venire.
Maybe, just a little.	Fortasse, paulo.
In other words, we don't have a job.	Id est, officium non habemus.
Why not?' 	Cur non?'
Not much to him.	Non ei multa.
We too.	Nos quoque.
I choose each other.	Libet inter se.
It will be fine.	Bene erit.
He does well.	Bene facit.
He could not.	Non potuit.
There is no need for us to do this.	Non opus est nobis hic facere.
We will travel soon.	Mox iter nobis erit.
It's a very important thing.	Est id ipsum sit rem.
This has been done.	Hoc factum est.
I didn't want to see someone.	Nolui videre aliquem.
It is necessary as well.	Necesse est ut etiam.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
I will tell him.	Dicam ei.
He likes my advice.	Meum consilium vult.
and it is good for me.	et bene mihi.
No one can find us here.	Nemo nos hic invenire potest.
Not again.	Non iterum.
Not here.	Non hic.
This was what he was about to do.	Hoc erat quod facturus erat.
That's all we can do.	Id omnia possumus.
But none other than him.	Nulla sed ipsum quam.
I didn't know what to do at the time.	Ego nesciebam quid hoc tempore.
we have time.	tempus habemus.
It's something you don't often get in time.	Est aliquid non saepe tempore ut.
That is what it is.	Id est, quid est.
He owes me nothing.	Mihi nihil debet.
There is nothing he can say.	Nihil est quod non possit dicere.
I hope it happens soon.	Spero mox fieri.
But it didn't take long to think again.	Sed non diu cogitare iterum.
I want you to do well.	Volo te bene facere.
I have nothing to do.	Non habeo hoc facere.
It can be done well, it can be done easily.	Fieri bene potest, facile per fieri potest.
It's not like we're on the day after all.	Non est sicut sumus in die post omnes.
I want you .	te volo .
It was never attempted.	Numquam erat conatus.
But it was only said.	Sed non dictum nisi.
I know you very well.	Novi nimis bene.
i've never tried.	numquam conatus sum.
I just don't do it.	Modo ne feceris.
The man said nothing.	Vir nihil dixit.
Almost none.	Fere nemo.
Yes you are right.	Ita recte.
and thus he had.	et sic habuit.
Not good or bad.	Non bene vel male.
Not as much as you think.	Non quantum putas.
I don't want to hear.	Nolo audire.
This could not really be done.	Hoc vere fieri non potuit.
And he knew that it was so.	Sciebat autem quod sic.
I saw it too late.	Sero vidi.
not you too.	Non tu quoque.
They are very good.	Valde.
Not soon enough.	Non cito satis.
And how are you.	Et quam tu.
He is the only man.	Solus homo est.
He is well with us.	Bene nobiscum est.
It does not please.	Non placet.
She asked me something.	Rogavit me aliquid.
He does his job and does it well.	Officium suum agit et bene facit.
Nothing else here now.	Nihil aliud hic nunc.
It was not enough.	Parum erat.
I just want to get home to her.	EGO iustus volo domum ad eam.
You forgot something.	Oblitus es aliquid.
Only please.	Tantum quaeso.
Yes, but that's the same.	Etiam id nisi ipsum.
But he knows the question.	Sed ille quidem scit quaestionem.
And he saw also.	Et vidit etiam.
I really love you.	Ego vere amo.
He saw nothing	Nihil vidit .
I didn't want to stop.	Nolui prohibere.
You ought to have me at all wrong.	Omnino male me habere debes .
This is not going to happen.	Hoc non est futurum.
Look at this.	Hoc vide.
never never never.	numquam numquam numquam.
It almost seemed too good to be true.	Fere nimium bonum videbatur esse verum.
He knew for sure that it was not true.	Sciebat certe non verum esse.
The road did not succeed.	Iter non obtinuit.
I've been through it.	Fui per eum.
But don't look too much.	Sed vide ne nimium.
What is certain is certain.	Certum quid certum.
Why does he do this?	Cur hoc facit.
Don't stop now.	Noli nunc prohibere.
But it is so hard for me.	Sed ita mihi difficile est.
This is what you need.	Hoc est quod debes.
But he was a good dog.	Sed canis bonus erat.
You can do this.	Hoc facere potes.
You can't do everything by yourself.	Omnia facere non potes per te ipsum.
Nothing else to say.	Nihil aliud dicere.
But see.	Sed vide.
I'm sorry I can't help anymore.	Paenitet me amplius adiuvare non possum.
One before.	Una ante.
The morning was busy.	Mane erat occupatus.
You can be pretty sure about it.	De illo satis certo potes esse.
But he does not wish to do so.	Sed hoc facere non vult.
But this is not very probable.	Sed id non admodum probabile.
That's not true.	Ut 'non est verum.
He doesn't want to talk.	Loqui non vult.
that is what they are.	id est id sunt.
That's kind of it.	Id genus est.
Getting there, but not there yet.	Questus est, sed non ibi sed.
I am astonished at you.	Miror te.
He only has me.	Solus habet me.
A little more.	Paulo plus.
I do not know.	Non scio.
That was thirty years ago.	id erat triginta annos.
I just didn't know what to do.	Modo nesciebat quid faceret.
But this was not.	Sed hoc non fuit.
You know I didn't say yes or no.	Scis non dicere necne.
He seemed to speak to him.	Videbatur ei loqui.
How	Quomodo.
But he could not say this now.	Sed hoc nunc dicere non potuit.
It should be pretty easy to get.	Debet satis facile ad.
This is certain.	Hoc certum est.
It was good to play.	Bonum erat ludere.
You can't talk to him.	Non potes ei loqui.
I don't want to do this.	Nolo hic facere.
That's what it is.	Ut id est enim.
No one from us, no one.	Nemo id a nobis, nemo.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
That never happened.	Quod nunquam factum est.
This is all.	Hoc totum est.
As, yes it is.	Ut, Sic est.
Now more than ever.	Nunc semper quam.
No, you can't get it!	Non, id habere non potes!
Not one time.	Non unum tempus.
Good to see you.	Bonum est te videre.
Are you sure that's enough?	Certus es id satis esse?
They are all here.	Omnes hic sunt.
But it is already done.	Sed iam factum est.
Nothing can be done about him.	De illo nihil fieri potest.
It won't be too hard for me.	Hoc mihi difficile non erit.
I'm afraid this is not the case.	Vereor ne hoc sit.
No one thought it could be done.	Fieri posse nemo putabat.
Just in case there is a problem.	Modo si quaestio est.
Her job was to go.	Ire ei officium erat.
Not long.	Non diu.
But here there is none.	Sed hic nulla.
I've never met him.	Nunquam ei occurrit.
In this way he does.	Hoc modo facit.
Who are.	Qui sunt.
To do something is to do something.	Facere aliquid est aliquid.
What would you like to do?	Quid velis agere?
And he says these things.	Et haec dicit.
I didn't know how to do it today.	Nesciebam quomodo hodie id faciam.
We're late already.	Sero iam sumus.
I thought about the problem.	Cogitavi de quaestionem.
And that was how.	Erat autem quam.
But it has not been said now.	Sed non dictum nunc.
I know well.	bene novi.
Must have it.	Debet habere eam.
How will you do the same?	Quomodo idem facturus es?.
It was too much money.	Nimis pecuniae erat.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
You may not even know it.	Ne illud quidem scire potes.
You want my help.	Auxilium meum vis.
And the time was indeed enough.	Et tempus quidem satis fuit.
I just didn't think that way.	Modo non modo putabat.
No as stated.	Nulla ut dictum est.
He thought he understood.	Putabat intellexit.
I'm saying it was bad.	Malum esse dicam.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
He tells me what to do.	Dicit mihi quid faciendum.
Not much, he thought.	Non multum, putabat.
I'm sorry you can't see.	Paenitet me videre non potes.
Which is very true.	Quod valde verum est.
Just like you.	Sicut et tibi.
You know what you are doing.	Scis quid facias.
And you can see what it is like.	Et videre potes quid sit simile.
I like what is going to happen.	Placet id quod futurum est.
To me, this is the only thing I need.	Mihi, hoc solum opus est.
Well that's just not what I do.	Bene quod modo non faciam.
Tell me why you want.	Dic mihi cur vis.
he said it was done.	dixit sic factum est.
Truly it was done.	Vere factum est.
Which will be better for you.	Quod tibi melius erit.
He comes to me.	Venit ad me.
I was able to do it.	id facere potui.
I had to see you.	Te videre habui.
You need to do it.	Opus est ut id facias.
It does not please.	Non placet.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
In what time is the film.	In sit amet tempus quam.
And love yourself.	Et amet ipsum.
That was a lot.	Ut sit amet erat.
You are not one.	Non unum.
Much better than before.	Multo melius quam ante.
Mine doesn't do that.	Meus non facit illud.
Do you want me to go there?	Certe illuc ire vis!.
But that's not enough.	Sed id parum.
But that was before.	Sed id ante erat.
I was supposed to know you too.	Scire te quoque putabam.
glad to know.	gaudeo scire.
I am completely different.	Ego omnino aliud.
It is necessary to go.	Necesse est ire.
I don't know what happened to you.	Nescio quid tibi acciderit.
He seemed to listen.	Videbatur audire.
But it is time itself.	Sed est tempus ipsum.
You're both working at the same time.	Simul utrumque opus es.
I want to do it first.	Primum facere volo.
I don't like it here.	Non placet hic.
he said.	dixit.
It could have been better.	Melius esse potuit.
This is hard work.	Hoc est difficile opus.
You still do it.	Adhuc id facis.
There was nothing to see.	Non erat aliquid videre.
I can pretty much do it.	Satis multa non possum.
But who's out here.	Sed quis hic ex.
You know that there is nothing.	Scis, quod nihil est.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
Where he would probably stay.	Ubi manere verisimile esset.
I have done this so far.	Hoc tantum feci.
But for the purpose.	Sed ad rem.
This dog likes to play.	Hic canis ludere vult.
You want me to be.	Me vis esse.
I am not really getting any of it.	Et non vere de aliquo questus est.
Thus and this.	Sic et hoc.
Now is not the time.	Nunc non tempus est.
Please think about that.	Placet cogitare in illo.
To go into business.	Ire in rem.
Something has everything.	Aliquid habet omnia.
But see.	Sed vide.
This is not possible.	Hoc modo fieri non potest.
I like to stay.	Placet mihi mane.
The father is there too.	Pater ibi quoque.
There is something similar here.	Simile est aliquid hic.
No you don't really.	Non vos, non vere.
That's what he did.	Quod est quod fecit.
Why not now.	Quare nunc non?.
Tell her all is well here.	Dic ei omnia bene hic esse.
These things are not the same.	Haec non sunt idem.
This is very good.	Hoc est ipsum bonum.
This cannot be true in this way.	Hoc modo verum esse non potest.
Tomorrow was in him.	Cras in ipsum erat.
Now how.	Nunc quam.
I am a good boy.	Bonus puer sum.
You owe nothing.	Nihil debes.
Like never again.	Sicut numquam iterum.
But it is evil.	Sed malum est.
If nothing else.	Si nihil aliud est.
I need your help.	Auxilium tuum mihi opus est.
It was almost time.	Erat fere nunc.
I don't know where it is.	ubi sit nescio.
Well pretty much everything.	Bene fere omnia.
There was none at all.	Nulla a nulla erat.
He could not.	Non potuit.
There was none in it.	Nulla in erat.
That's not right now.	Id nunc non.
But here I am.	Sed hic sum.
To see nothing, to hear nothing.	Nihil videre, nihil audire.
So it is.	Ita est.
All the time.	Omnia temporis.
There is more to us that way.	Plus est nobis eo modo.
It's time to always be ahead.	Aliquam semper tempus ante.
Most likely nothing with it.	Verisimile nihil cum eo.
It was probably that, but not well.	Probabile erat id, sed non bene.
He wanted time to learn.	Tempus scire voluit.
He was there and did it.	Ibi erat ille fecit.
I know people know these things.	Novi homines haec scit.
I thought I was like that.	Putavi esse simile.
The day never even got up.	Ne dies quidem obtinuit.
In none of us.	In non nulla nobis.
I must do this.	Hoc facere debeo.
He seemed really willing to chat with someone.	Videbatur vere velle loqui cum aliquo.
But that is the time.	Sed id tempus est.
Better to leave him alone for a while.	Melius est eum solum ad tempus relinquere.
never understood.	numquam intellexit.
I don't know how to help you.	Nescio quomodo te adiuvet.
You can see why.	Potes videre quare.
Know you're here.	Scire te esse hic.
This is that man.	Hic est ille homo.
Not so good.	Non bonus.
He was right.	Recte erat.
It was very good that way.	Erat valde bona illo modo.
I need to do something.	Mihi opus est facere aliquid.
He was a very good man.	Vir erat valde bonus.
He was either us or	Vel nobis vel erat.
I've heard a lot about you.	Audivi de te multum.
We're going home now.	Nunc domum sumus.
You do it at home.	Domi te facere.
He was scared now.	Vix erat nunc.
I am not so sure.	Non ita certus sum.
I still see a lot of things.	Multum adhuc video.
There was nothing to do.	Nihil erat facere.
To you.	Tibi.
There doesn't seem to be much else to do here.	Non multum aliud hic facere videtur.
He does well.	Bene facit.
They are what they are.	Sunt id quod sunt.
I want to know.	Scire volo.
It seems so.	Ita videtur.
I need to think again.	Iterum opus est cogitare.
I'm at home now.	Nunc domi sum.
It seemed to help.	Adiuvare videbatur.
I see the problem.	quaestionem video.
If you're not sure.	Si certus sis.
This is what is going to happen.	Hoc est quod futurum est.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
He said he'd better.	Melius dixit se velis.
But to do it.	Sed id facere.
Why does this man speak more than all?	Cur hic homo plus omnibus loquitur?
But there is some love for him.	Sed sit amet aliquam ipsum.
That's not to say please.	Ut non dictum velit.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
But certainly.	Sed certe.
She never played a job.	Quae numquam officium.
what happened after.	quid post factum est.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
He thought that he understood everything.	Putabat se omnia intelligere.
He was a good man.	Vir bonus erat.
I wonder what she thought of me at this time.	Miror quid hoc tempore a me velit, putavit.
I can't come home to you again.	Non possum iterum ad te venire domum.
This is too much for me.	Hoc nimium mihi est.
There was a time when he thought he had said what he wished.	Tempus erat, cum quae vellet dixisse putabat.
That's great.	Magna id.
People need to know.	Homines scire opus est.
Or see for yourself.	Vel vide tibi.
I'm pretty sure it's just that.	Satis certo scio illud solum esse.
He was at home.	Erat domi.
There is.	Ibi est.
It's too late.	Sero nimis est.
He says that he does.	Dicit se facit.
He loves me.	Me amat.
It is more than he knows.	Plus est quam scit.
Tomorrow that's the first time.	Cras id primum.
He loves, loves, loves.	Amat, amat, amat.
This will not be yours alone.	Hoc solum tibi non erit.
It would be something else.	Esset aliquid aliud.
I am busy as always.	Ego sum occupatus ut semper.
Yes, it was time.	Etiam tempus erat.
Maybe it was great.	Aliquam erat magna.
I do probably still.	Probabiliter adhuc facio.
I don't see why not.	Non video cur non.
Unable to go.	Posset ire.
Time.	Tempus.
Or none at all.	Vel ipsum nulla.
Be prepared in the morning.	Paratus mane.
I see her home.	eam domum video.
There will be no day.	Non erit dies.
It was not intended.	Non voluit.
Even who it was.	Etiam quis erat.
He was very lonely.	Solus erat valde.
Now without me.	Modo sine me.
You can't do that thing.	Non potes illud aliquid.
I hope you will like it.	Spero fore ut placet.
But he said he had not had a great time.	Sed et quam nec magna tempus dictum.
There is no need, but there is need.	Non opus est, sed opus est.
I'm going to the car.	Eo currus.
This was not true.	Hoc non fuit.
I could not do it without her.	sine illa facere non potui.
He can't even speak rightly.	Ne recte quidem loqui potest.
But it is even said.	Sed vel dictum est.
This was something new to me.	Hoc mihi aliquid novi fuit.
You have it here.	Habes huc.
Time to travel.	Tempus iter.
He doesn't know what he wants.	Nescit quid velit.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
He saw.	Vidit.
It's not too late.	Non hoc sero.
Now it was.	Nunc erat.
Make me with you.	Fac me tecum.
it was done this week.	id dictum est hac septimana.
Or who wants.	Vel quis velit.
And I would not like to give it.	Et non esset simile ei dare.
That's what we'll do.	Id faciam nobis.
He came here for years.	Hic ad annos venit.
Now was not the time.	Nunc nec tempus erat.
But he didn't want the time before.	Sed nec velit tempus ante.
She told us all about this.	De hoc nobis omnibus indicavit.
It will not be for me.	Non erit mihi.
Maybe not from ex.	Aliquam non ex ex.
So bad he went home.	Hoc malum sic abiit in domum suam.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
Can do as you like.	Facere potest ut libet.
I'll tell her in the afternoon.	Dicam ei post meridiem.
It's fine.	Bene sit.
Not at this time.	Non hoc tempore.
It won't be long.	Non diu erit.
My father is good.	Pater meus bonus est.
Now he can do what he wants.	Nunc potest quod velit.
She was so happy.	Tam felix illa fuit.
He knew what was going to happen.	Sciebat quid futurum esset.
I feel very happy here.	Hic valde felix sentio.
Over again, I don't know what.	Plus iterum, non quid.
I heard them all.	Audivi omnes.
He doesn't want me.	Non vult me.
You can do it.	Facere potes.
And don't do as you don't have in yourself.	Et non ita fac sicut non habes in te.
And there he is.	Et ibi est.
Yes it is, it is both.	Ita est, utrumque est.
And now I have it.	Id nunc quoque habeo.
She told me about you.	Illa mihi de te dixit.
I have seen the work.	Vidi opus.
As it was, it was not.	Sicut erat, id non fuit.
That was his.	Quod eius fuit.
I am very pleased.	Ego sum admodum.
I'll take a look.	Vide Faciam.
You also know.	Tu quoque scis.
He told me nothing.	Dixit me nihil.
I hope it will be.	Spero fore.
He was just not sure here.	Hic, iustus certus non erat.
She didn't know what else to do.	Quid aliud facere illa nesciebat.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
In the game itself.	In velit ipsum.
He wasn't that kind of guy.	Non erat id genus guy.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
I don't know how it can be done.	Nescio quomodo id fieri possit.
What is? 	Quid est?
I hope you are too.	Spero te quoque.
He could not even speak.	Ne loqui quidem potuit.
There are many.	Ibi multa sunt.
I want nothing for you.	Tuum nihil volo.
I do not want to do these things.	haec facere nolo.
And often it is.	Et saepe sit.
I myself do not see.	Ego ipse non video.
No one said anything.	Nulla dictum aliquam aliquam.
He didn't want one.	Noluit unum.
I really don't think so.	Ego vere non puto fore.
I could think	cogitare potui.
But these are enough.	Sed haec satis sunt.
I have not seen him.	Non vidi eum.
I wish I could be better.	Melius vellem.
How is it?	Quomodo eum.
This can be what you want.	Hoc potest esse quod vis.
This is almost always.	Haec fere.
This was a lot of fun.	Hic sit amet erat.
I'm doing very well.	Facio me optime.
It's time or great.	Aliquam vel magna.
Maybe it's the same thing.	Fortasse idem est.
what about him	Quid de eo.
Who is.	Quis est.
Well done.	Bene fecit.
You know when she	Scis, cum illa.
This thing is for us.	Quae res, nobis.
It is necessary that from this.	Necesse est ut ex hoc.
Maybe that was him.	Aliquam id erat ipsum.
This is correct.	Hoc bene est.
Even when it's not working right now.	Etiam cum nunc non opus est.
why is she?	cur illa.
May it be for us.	Sit nobis sit.
Why don't you do it now.	Cur id nunc non facis.
That's not the same thing.	Ut non ipsum.
You must have made a trip for me.	Debes iter pro me fecisse.
I haven't seen anyone.	Quis non vidi.
There is not one way to get there.	Iter unum non est illuc.
And she didn't want to be.	Et illa esse noluit.
This was done afterward.	Post hoc factum est.
she said.	illa dixit.
This post is up to you.	Post hoc ad vos est.
he thought.	putavit.
Now, indeed.	Nunc, enim.
Tell me where you are.	Dic ubi sis.
It is true, so far as it is.	Verum est, quantum est.
You do it if you can leave.	Facis, si relinquere potes.
it is not yet done.	nondum factum est.
That can be good.	Quod potest esse bonum.
No one knows what you mean except yourself.	Nemo scit quid vis, nisi tibi.
I could leave him there.	Eum ibi relinquere potui.
I knew it was going to be bad.	Sciebam futurum esse malum.
It's time to be yourself.	Aliquam ut ipsum est.
My dog ​​loves him.	Canis meus eum amat.
This was what he understood.	Hoc erat quod intellexit.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
I doubt you're going to do it.	Dubito te facturum.
Thus it could be done. 	Sic fieri potuit. 
Everything is fine here.	Hic omnia bene est.
It was in New Orleans.	Aliquam in erat est.
I didn't tell you.	Non dixi tibi.
And nothing else.	Et nihil aliud.
This school is great.	Haec schola magna est.
It was for you.	Vobis fuit.
You can't even think of this alone.	Hoc solum ne cogitare quidem potes.
I don't even know that.	Ne id quidem scio.
He knows why he is there.	Scit cur ibi sit.
I want it.	ego eam.
But that's not possible.	Quod non potest, sed.
He knows her from whom.	Novit eam ex quo.
I myself have done it.	Ego ipse feci.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
For this reason.	Pro hoc.
Yes that's great.	Etiam id magna.
He does this often.	Hoc saepe facit.
I would probably.	Probabiliter vellem.
Let me tell you something.	Dicam tibi aliquid.
But it was not the same.	Sed non ipsum erat.
Do not believe.	Noli credere.
What to do.	Quid facere.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
Maybe not at all.	Aliquam non nulla.
I know you're able to do this.	Scio te hoc facere posse.
Again more.	Iterum plus.
I'm not sure what's going to happen.	Certus sum quid futurum esset.
This is not necessarily a bad thing.	Ne id malum sit necesse est.
He didn't want to do it.	Id facere noluisse.
This is the only way it's done.	Hoc solum modo factum est.
To be honest now.	Ut sit amet nunc.
It's easy to buy into it.	In eam emere facile est.
I didn't want this to happen again.	Nolui id iterum fieri.
Don't give up on your day job.	Noli dare diem tuum officium.
Not a little.	Nec paulo.
You all.	Vos omnes.
But you can't have both, man.	Sed utrumque habere non potes, homo.
I'm not even that.	Non sum id quidem.
You know well.	Bene scis.
But it is not good.	Sed non est bonum.
What about you?	Quid de te?.
Make yourself look great.	Fac tibi magna vide.
I'm afraid that's all necessary.	Vereor ne necesse est omnia.
I like everything about him.	Mihi placet omnia de eo.
You just get what you want.	Tu modo id quod vis.
You didn't have time to think.	Tempus cogitare non fecisti.
Was.	Erat.
Don't look	Non vide.
You have to come.	Venire habes.
Not before that.	Non ante id.
That was it.	Illa fuit.
It's not going to happen.	Non futurum est.
She could barely keep up with it.	Posset vix ut cum.
never asked what it was.	numquam quaesivit quid esset.
I want everything to be done right.	Omnia recte fieri volo.
That would be enough.	Id satis esse.
They are not men.	Homines non sunt.
It's not the same as that.	Etiam non ipsum quam.
Now make your decision.	Nunc fac consilium tuum.
Maybe that was great.	Aliquam id magna erat.
Again he did what he said.	Iterum fecit quod dixit.
He does not say to us.	Non dicit nobis.
Good vs evil.	Bonum nobis malum.
But that's the same thing.	Id ipsum sed.
He told me what he told you.	Dixit mihi quid dixit tibi.
Truly it's going to happen.	Vere futurum est.
No one knows why.	Cur nemo scit.
I'm working tomorrow.	Cras Im 'opus.
I don't want to think about tonight no more.	Nolo cogitare de hac nocte, non amplius.
To do something for him.	Facere aliquid ut eum.
That he was not.	Ut non erat.
But how? 	Sed quomodo?
I thought perhaps something to do with it.	Cogitavi fortasse aliquid facere cum eo.
He was here, now he knew.	Hic erat, nunc scivit.
I didn't have enough time to do what I wanted.	Non satis temporis est facere quae vellet.
but he does.	sed facit.
That would be good.	Quod bonum esset.
Really didn't know.	Vere nesciebat.
It is not to say.	Dicere non est.
And at least that's the time now.	Et certe id tempus nunc.
About one in the afternoon.	Fere unus post meridiem.
I hope to do it myself.	Spero ut me ipsum facere.
But not.	Sed non.
He was the only guy.	Solus erat guy.
But that's not even enough.	Sed ne id quidem satis.
She said.	Illa dixit.
I don't know what's wrong.	Nescio quid mali.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Which is not so.	Quod non ita est.
Nothing but you.	Nihil nisi te.
He who speaks all things.	Ille qui omnia loquitur.
Appreciate your time.	Bene tuum tempus.
Not even a dog.	Ne canis quidem.
Not much really.	Non multum vere.
He is now here.	Hic nunc est.
He gave him the money.	Dedit ei pecuniam.
From and on.	Ex et in.
Maybe one day it was time.	Forsitan unus dies esset tempus.
He did nothing as yet.	Nihil adhuc fecit.
But nothing.	Sed nihil.
Not all of us.	Non omnes nos.
That's enough.	Id satis est.
Making sure someone does or does.	Certum vel faciens aliquem facit.
Maybe he still does.	Fortasse adhuc facit.
not really a thing.	Nonne vere est aliquid.
And it is great.	Et magna est.
What to do.	Quid faceret.
Per se, the same thing throughout.	Per se, idem per totum.
It's good to see you.	Suus 'bonus te videre.
But let's not be very happy.	Sed sit amet ipsum nisi.
What are yours?	Quae sunt tua?.
This has not been done in this way.	Hoc modo factum non est.
Yes there are some.	Etiam sunt aliquam.
You are here for your good.	Hic es ad bonum tuum.
You do what you can.	Facis quod potes.
We can't give you everything you want.	Omnia quae vis tibi dare non possumus.
I just said that he wants to talk.	Modo dixit se velle loqui.
Now that's none other than.	Nunc id nulla nisi.
I wonder what time it is.	Miror quid nunc est.
It's behind you.	Est post te.
and yet he knew it.	et tamen scivit.
Really good.	Vere bonum.
I can see what you really are.	Videre possum te quid vere sis.
I couldn't either.	Vel non potui.
There's always tomorrow.	Cras semper nulla.
If not, you do not.	Si non, non facis.
I will not make you money.	Non faciam te pecuniam.
This is better.	Hoc melius est.
No one knows what will happen to him.	Nemo scit quid de se futurum sit.
There was absolutely nothing.	Omnino nihil erat.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
Things haven't been so well lately.	Res non tam bene nuper.
I was sure to believe you.	Certus eram tibi credere.
The situation is the same.	Sic se res habet.
He has this .	Hoc habet .
He is not at home.	Non est domi.
Well indeed.	Bene quidem.
One thing is not good.	Unum bonum non est.
I am totally sure.	Prorsus certus sum.
She can't be left alone.	Reliquit modo illa non potest.
I've never met like this before.	Numquam mihi sic ante occurrit.
I don't know how this was done.	Nescio quomodo hoc factum sit.
You need to do everything you can.	Omnia debes facere quod potes.
It was great to see him.	Magna erat videre eum.
I have everything.	Omnia habeo.
i have you there.	habeo ibi.
But how do you do it?	Sed quomodo id facis.
I don't want you to do anything with it.	Non vis tibi aliquid facere cum illo.
He couldn't believe what he had already done.	Non potuit credere quod iam fecit.
Look at what you've done.	Vide quid feceris.
There is an.	Ibi est an.
He never was.	Numquam erat.
As you yourself.	Ut tu ipse.
You can believe.	Credere potes.
He is a morning man.	Mane homo est.
He willed, but did not understand.	Voluit, sed non intellexit.
He never came home.	Numquam domum venit.
Nothing is enough for a thing.	Nihil satis ad rem.
cannot go.	ire non potest.
Believe him not.	Noli ei credere.
The boy doesn't seem to understand the problem.	Puer quaestionem intelligere non videtur.
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
He didn't want to talk about what happened.	Noluit loqui quod factum est.
I'll tell you what's up with him.	Dicam tibi quid cum illo.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I can't say for sure.	Non possum pro certo dicere.
There was time, there was no time.	Tempus erat, tempus non erat.
I don't know anything about that.	Nescio quid de illo.
He was truly a good man.	Vere vir bonus erat.
Well still.	Bene tamen.
he loves us so much.	nos tantum amat.
He saw also.	Vidit etiam.
But we can do something about this.	Sed de hoc aliquid possumus.
but I never heard of you.	numquam tamen de te audivi.
I am ready for this.	Ad hoc paratus sum.
He saw nothing else of him.	Nihil aliud de eo vidit.
Do the work.	Opus fac.
Right, that is.	Recte, id est.
Someone knows.	Scit aliquis.
Certainly, not enough.	Certe, parum.
It was better.	Melius erat.
Now, he loves him.	Nunc, ipsum amet.
There's still time to do something.	Non est adhuc tempus ad aliquid faciendum.
It is still pretty easy.	Adhuc satis facile.
The boy should be able to see.	Puer ut videre possit.
This is.	Hic est.
And now you want to go home.	Et nunc domum ire vis.
I really wanted to do something.	Ego vere voluit aliquid esse.
I am who	Ego sum qui.
I don't think this is true.	Non puto hoc verum esse.
Tell me you don't need it.	Dic mihi non opus est.
See you tomorrow.	Cras te videre.
I don't know how he did it.	Nescio quomodo fecerit.
He did not even see.	Eum ne vidit quidem.
It was great, though.	Magna erat, sed.
No no no.	Nulla non nulla.
I don't know what to say.	Nescio quid dicam.
Maybe you'd better.	Forsitan melius velis.
I think of him.	Puto eum.
He does evil.	Malum facit.
You've never seen anyone.	Quae numquam quis.
That's too much.	Nimium id.
He knew it would happen.	Sciebat fore.
There was none in there.	In non erat nulla.
I don't want to choose.	Nolo velit.
It is so difficult.	Tam difficile est.
We can!.	Nos potes!.
This one is easy.	Facile hoc unum.
Happy to help.	Felix auxilium.
Nothing else but you.	Nihil aliud est nisi tu.
for it is truly to see.	vere enim videre est.
Not sure what can be done.	Certo quid fieri possit.
I don't like to go.	Ire non placet.
Will need to be late tonight.	Sero opus erit hac nocte.
he said that he knew nothing about him.	dixit se nihil de eo scire.
This is he.	Hic est ille.
I hope it's not.	Spero eam non.
Well here we are.	Bene hic sumus.
You are not the same as anyone.	Non ipsum quis.
I saw his name for the first time.	eius nomen primum vidi.
and could have.	et habere potuit.
But he knew that his design was not necessary.	Sed sciebat consilium suum opus non esse.
I think more.	Plus puto.
I want to see something else.	Volo aliquid aliud videre.
You know something.	Scis in aliquo.
For that is.	Id enim est.
What he wanted.	Quae voluit.
Yes, but it was not.	Etiam nec erat nisi.
The boy refused to go to school.	Puer in scholam ire noluit.
But there was no time.	Sed tempus non erat.
Lunch is now.	Prandium nunc est.
She loves to help.	Adiuvare amat.
He was a boy.	Puer erat.
There was something out there.	Aliquid ex erat.
Which could be rightly done.	Quod recte fieri posset.
He can know nothing about this.	De hoc nihil potest scire.
I am still very sorry.	Valde adhuc sum.
That which no one seems to understand.	Id quod nemo intelligere videtur.
I want him with us.	Illum volo apud nos.
Do this, do not do it.	Hoc fac, ne feceris.
Yes it is possible.	Ita fieri potest.
He does not know.	Nescit.
But it is not from.	Sed non est ex.
He was not a man.	Homo non erat.
My dad is pretty good.	Pater meus fere bonus.
I have always done it.	Semper id feci.
So tell me the truth.	Ita mihi verum dic.
He is not a man.	Homo non est.
I love the way it looks.	Sic amo spectat.
The more you can, the better.	Quo plus potes, eo melius.
I saw one.	Vidi unum.
I love, I love.	amo amo.
In this.	In hoc.
He likes to go and see you.	Velit te ire et videre.
None of this is none but him.	Nulla id nulla sed ipsum.
Can talk with someone.	Loqui posse cum aliquo.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
There is no morning man.	Mane homo non est.
It's not that much.	Etiam non quam.
I do nothing.	Nihil facio.
He could have easily had it, but he had better.	Facile habere potuit, sed melius habuit.
Please leave your first name and question.	Primum nomen tuum et quaestionem quaeso relinquere.
That speaks to you.	Quod loquitur ad vos.
That which never appears, never appears.	Quod umquam videtur, numquam videtur.
you need to be at home.	domi esse debes.
This is enough for me.	Hoc mihi satis est.
There was nothing here.	Hic aliquid non erat.
He is no longer a good man.	Vir bonus iam non est.
I hope I don't have you here.	Spero te huc non habere.
I had the money.	Pecuniam habui.
At that time.	Illo tempore.
Don't say anything.	Noli dicere.
I think it's probably too late.	Puto nimis sero verisimile est.
But somehow.	Sed nescio quo modo.
I just have to stop.	Ego iustus ad prohibere.
Nothing else could be done.	Nihil aliud potuit.
yes here to see you.	Etiam hic te videre.
The first thing to do.	Primum aliquid facere.
All right, well.	Recte, bene.
And it started well.	Et bene incepit.
Much has been said about him.	De illo satis dictum est.
Or perhaps it is not.	Vel fortasse non est.
This was what you did.	Hoc erat quod fecisti.
I was one of them all.	ex omnibus fui.
He could have done better indeed.	Melius quidem potuit.
You are not thinking.	Non cogitas.
I think about you too.	Te quoque puto.
There was no one in it before.	In non erat quis ante.
It's your job.	Officium tuum est.
But it is for us.	Sed pro nobis est.
But you go for the best.	Sed tu pro optime.
But that is none.	Sed id nulla est.
It's very good for me.	Mihi valde bonum est.
I don't believe it for sure.	Non credo, certe.
No shipment is out.	Nulla sit amet enim ex.
I love you very much.	Te valde amo.
It wasn't the kind that I thought.	Non erat genus ut putavit.
I need to think.	Mihi opus est cogitare.
No that is.	Nulla id est.
You are not right.	Non recte.
He had no idea it was going to happen.	Sic futurum nesciebat.
Not for him.	Non ei.
I really don't feel very well.	Ego vere non sentio optime.
That's enough before.	Id satis ante.
I don't know how to do it now.	Nescio quomodo id facere modo.
I can't seem to do it.	non possum id videri.
to be here now.	Hic nunc esse.
We can do nothing.	Nihil possumus.
It's kind of bad.	Malum genus est.
I am astonished too.	Miror etiam me.
Its time of year again.	Eius id tempus anno iterum.
Hardly to her.	Ad vix eius.
She has much to say to him.	Dicere ei multa habet.
Yes, it is, it is.	Etiam, est, est.
You can't be here without him.	Hic sine illo esse non potes.
It looks and looks so good.	Ita bene videtur et spectat.
You don't do anything!	Non aliquid!
Or he could stop tonight.	Vel hac nocte prohibere potuit.
I can't think of myself.	Non possum ipse cogitare.
But he could not know.	Scire tamen potuit.
we cannot go.	ire non possumus.
That's him.	Ut id est ipsum.
am getting used to it.	questus sum ad eam.
It was good, though.	Bonum erat, sed.
Except for someone.	Nisi quis eum.
I was okay with that.	Cum bene essem.
Not well.	Non bene.
That's for sure.	Ut est certe.
I don't like work.	Opus non placet.
This has been repeatedly said.	Hoc saepe dictum est.
I've done it.	Ego feci.
Don't think about it yet.	Noli adhuc cogitare.
Play for sure.	Ludere certe.
But it was never mine.	Sed numquam erat mea.
There is no need for us to find out.	Non opus est nobis invenire.
I didn't think you thought that.	Non putavi te id putare.
I do not know why it is not, but it is not.	Nescio cur non sit, sed non est.
Who and what.	Quis quid.
Not in that way.	Non eo modo.
She just didn't want to take it.	Illa iustus accipere noluit.
Someone who you can talk to really easily.	Aliquem qui vere facile loqui potes.
He refused to see.	Noluit videre.
I wish this would be true.	Utinam hoc verum sit.
Or something like that.	Vel aliquid ut.
Something you will never do.	Aliquid numquam facere.
But he could do nothing.	Sed nihil potuit.
as I see today.	ut hodie video.
I know what it is.	Scio quid sit.
He was in that very thing.	In id ipsum erat.
But it is not from.	Sed non est ex.
Too soon, too quickly.	Nimis cito, nimium cito.
At length he came.	Tandem venit.
You can do whatever you want.	Facere potes quod vis.
Just like my name.	Sicut nomen meum.
I feel this.	Hoc sentio.
I will not do it again.	Non faciam iterum.
No one comes except her.	Nemo venit, nisi eam.
I will not.	Nolo.
But certainly, this is hardly a job.	Sed certe, hoc officium vix est.
it is the same.	ipsum est.
My father could not believe it.	Pater meus credere non potuit.
Tomorrow is not bad.	Cras non est malum.
He thought a little different.	Putabat aliud parum.
He could not even speak.	Ne loqui quidem potuit.
Maybe there was no wish.	Aliquam non erat velit.
He said not much.	Non multum dixit.
if you want to be.	si vis esse.
He would make a house.	Faceret domum.
This is going to happen.	Hoc futurum est.
Everything with you is something new.	Omnia apud te sunt aliquid novi.
It's not too late yet.	Sero tamen non est.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
He never told me everything.	Numquam mihi quae.
There is .	Ibi est .
Nothing about this yet.	Nihil hac adhuc.
But she would not.	Sed illa nolebat.
It doesn't seem necessary.	Necesse non videtur.
He does well.	Bene facit.
Let me play.	Sine me ludere.
never not really.	numquam non vere.
It's really good.	Vere bonus est.
This is the first time.	Hoc est primum.
I forgot his name.	Oblitus sum nomen eius.
He doesn't want to do it.	Non vult facere.
He knows his job is here.	Scit officium suum hic esse.
He was the only one who didn't want to.	Solus erat qui nolebat.
I've been here too long.	Hic nimium diu eram.
I need to go.	Ire debeo.
I hope so.	Spero ita esse.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
It is still early yet.	Adhuc mane adhuc.
You can't do things.	Quae facere non potes.
They are not.	Non sunt.
I'm the new guy.	Ego novi guy.
I did what he said.	Feci quod dixit.
This time is no different.	Hoc tempus non est aliud.
But this was not done.	Sed hoc non est factum.
It was time to think.	Tempus erat cogitare.
Nothing else for this.	Nihil aliud ad hoc.
He's also with us.	Hic et nobiscum est.
I don't need to think.	Non opus est cogitare.
My room is not.	Cubiculum meum non est.
If it pleases you.	Si placet vobis.
We always go to the mall for dinner.	Semper ad prandium vir ad nos.
But not all.	Sed non omnes.
It's just something that happened.	Suus 'iustus aliquid quod factum est.
This was not the same.	Hoc non erat idem.
I won't even talk to you tomorrow.	Ego ne cras quidem ad te loqui.
It is certain, however.	Certum tamen.
Now that's a great statement.	Nunc id dictum magna.
I've never been before.	Nunquam ante fui.
There is nothing new in it.	Nihil novi in ​​eo est.
Maybe again.	Fortasse iterum.
We need to stop.	Necesse est nos prohibere.
Now not always zero.	Nunc non semper nulla.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
But never really.	Sed numquam vere.
For what was not certain.	Quid enim non erat certum.
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
But he did not see.	Sed non vidit.
He can do nothing wrong.	Male facere nihil potest.
He left for work this morning.	Hodie mane opus reliquit.
I would like to make friends.	Vellem amicos facere.
See you tomorrow!	Cras te videre!
Buy the goods.	Bona emere.
This was nothing.	Hic nihil erat.
Or as.	Vel ut.
Nothing can stop you.	Nihil potes prohibere.
I am sure often.	Mihi certe saepe.
He does much, much better.	Multum ille facit, multo melius.
I could hardly do it.	Vix id facere potui.
I never really saw him.	Numquam eum vere vidi.
So he got the money.	Ita pecuniam obtinuit.
He does not love.	Non amat.
But not so.	Sed non sic.
That was not him.	Ut non erat ipsum.
It still looks good.	Adhuc bonum spectat.
A must stay.	A manere debet.
Well understood.	Bene intellexit.
I don't know what could be done.	Quid fieri possit nescio.
At that time there was nothing.	Eo tempore nihil erat.
This was a job.	Hoc erat officium.
I hope she does great.	Spero magna facit eam.
You will be great.	Magna vis erit.
i have so much.	tantum habeo.
Everything was mine.	Meus erat omnia.
I don't know what's wrong.	Quid mali sit nescio.
Do not do this.	Noli hoc facere.
Maybe he didn't.	Fortasse non fecit.
It will not always be like this.	Non erit hoc sic semper.
I just couldn't do it.	Modo me facere non potuit.
If he did that.	Quod si fecerit.
You want to be a man.	Vis esse homo.
I know this for sure.	Hoc pro certo scio.
It's not too late for me, that is.	Non mihi sero est, hoc est.
So good to come from you.	Tam bene de te venire.
Some but some none.	Aliquam sed aliquam nulla.
I want to win one day.	Vincere volo unum diem.
Good morning to you all.	Bonum mane ad vos omnes.
This is certainly true.	Hoc certe verum est.
We can help!	Adiuvare possumus!.
What before, here is.	Quod ante, hic est.
You have done nothing wrong.	Nihil mali fecisti.
I was the only one to see it.	Ego unus eram qui id video.
The first is what he does really good.	Una, vere bonum est quod facit.
Maybe he was a man after all.	Fortasse homo fuit post omnes.
You can't do both.	Utrumque facere non potes.
Good to see you.	Bonum est te videre.
but he who made it knows.	sed novit qui fecit.
They are not there.	Non sunt ibi.
I can't stop anymore.	Non possum prohibere posse.
Maybe someone great.	Aliquam quis magna.
No one does it.	Nemo id facit.
He's finally here.	Hic tandem est.
I hope you all like it.	Spero vos omnes placet.
I've been here too long.	Hic nimium diu fui.
You said that .	Dixisti quod .
That's where he was.	Id ubi erat.
I don't know what this is.	Nescio quid hoc sit.
Yes, there is a plan.	Etiam consilium est.
But it is evil.	Sed malum est.
I don't believe you yet.	Non credo tamen.
I can't exactly think.	Non possum prorsus cogitare.
I never heard, never seen.	Numquam audivi, numquam vidi.
It's not very important.	Etiam non magna ipsum.
But this was not done.	Sed hoc non est factum.
I hope for the future.	Spero futurum.
Certainly all or nothing.	Certe omnia vel nihil.
Who knows.	Quis scit.
No one can tell me what's wrong with me.	Nemo potest mihi dicere quid mali me.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
It's not going to be enough.	Non satis futurum est.
It was like we weren't there.	Similis erat nobis ne ibi.
Are you with us.	Esne nobiscum.
what I have done.	quod ego feci.
I do a lot of things.	Multum facio.
He does the work for you.	Opus facit in te.
You mean for sure.	Vis certe.
It was his job.	Eius officium erat.
This is not good.	Nec hoc bonum est.
Don't understand.	Noli intelligere.
This was different.	Hoc aliud fuit.
Tell me what you need.	Dic quid opus sit.
I just told myself that.	Ego tantum dixi me esse.
This never happened.	Hoc numquam factum est.
This is my advice.	Meum est consilium.
No one does.	Nemo facit.
That's the same thing anyone does.	Id ipsum quis facit.
He could not think of this.	Hoc cogitare non potuit.
But it was not going to happen to me.	Sed non erat mihi futurum.
But he does not believe this to be true.	Sed hoc credere non facit verum.
He knows everything to say to him.	Scit se omnia dicere ei.
My father needed it, he told me.	Pater meus ad id opus fuit, is dixit mihi.
I have seen so much.	tantum vidi.
not by someone.	Non ab aliquo.
I don't know whether it's true or not.	Non scio an verum sit necne.
He knew what his job was.	Sciebat quid sibi esset officium.
I have seen us.	Vidi nos.
Do the test beforehand.	Facere amet ante quam.
it is absolutely necessary.	necesse est omnino.
I know these things.	Haec ego novi.
He did not come to her.	Non venit ad eam.
I thought we both could go.	Putabam nos ambo posse proficisci.
I don't know how it's happened at all.	Omnino nescio quomodo acciderit.
So he was with me.	Sic erat apud me.
She doesn't love me anymore.	Illa me amplius non amat.
It's fine.	Bene sit.
Maybe it will be enough.	Fortasse satis erit.
It was good.	Bonum erat.
I would do it too.	id quoque facerem.
Now it really is.	Nunc vere est.
But he did not do it.	Sed id non fecit.
He says well.	Dicit bene.
I don't know what's wrong with this.	Nescio quid mali hoc.
I believe in you.	credo tecum.
Late in the afternoon, he began to see things.	Sero post meridiem, res videre incepit.
She was already like that.	Illa iam similis erat.
there was no question.	nulla quaestio erat.
Now it was not.	Nunc non erat.
Truly, truly.	Vere, vere.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
he could not see.	videre non potuit.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
It's early in the year.	Mane anno est.
There was still a lot of work.	Multum tamen opus fuit.
He is still alive.	Ipse adhuc est.
I don't know anything else.	Nescio aliud.
I need to listen.	Mihi opus est audire.
I knew exactly what was going to happen.	Prorsus sciebam quid futurum esset.
That day is gone.	Dies ille abiit.
I think he's here.	Puto hic est.
It was so.	Sic erat.
Maybe even from him.	Aliquam vel ipsum ex.
You can say whatever you want.	Dicere potes quod vis.
make me with you.	fac me tecum.
Do this work if you can.	Fac hoc opus, si potes.
What he did not know, and why he did not know.	Quae nesciebat, et cur nesciebat.
In the night	In nocte.
If you think .	Si cogitas .
The boy is ready, sure enough.	Puer paratus, certe satis.
i never knew who it was.	numquam scivi quis esset.
It was pretty good.	Erat satis bona.
I was there with him.	Fui ibi cum eo.
No one knows how to do it.	Nemo scit facere.
We are not alone.	Nos non solum.
I was late, he said.	Sero eram, dixit.
Good and good.	Bene et bonum.
I love how hard it is.	Quam difficile est amo.
I wanted time to do it.	tempus facere volui.
Maybe you should.	Forsitan ut.
You should know this.	Hoc scire debes.
This video has everything.	Hoc video omnia habet.
Maybe that was none.	Aliquam id nulla erat.
It's time to do it for you.	Aliquam id facere vobis.
What it looks like.	Quod spectat sicut.
It was lunch.	Prandium erat.
Yes and it is great.	Etiam et magna est.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
I want to help.	Adiuvare volo.
You can find many things here.	Multa hic invenire potes.
Yes, not only yourself.	Etiam non nisi ipsum.
Where is he? 	Ubi est ille?
If you have this job on that day yet.	Si hoc officium in eo die sed.
I'm there right now.	Ibi nunc sum.
And again, again nothing.	Et iterum iterum nihil.
What I'll tell you.	Quod tibi dicam.
But it is not that.	Sed non est id.
I want you by me.	Te per me volo.
I'm ready to go now.	Paratus sum nunc ire.
No not great.	Nulla non magna.
He didn't want to do that.	Noluit facere.
But to save him.	Sed ut ipsum nisi.
I hope I love you.	Spero te amo.
I knew so much of the time.	Sciebam tantum temporis.
Who is the one.	Qui unum.
He does not come.	Non venit.
I wanted to know what it was.	scire volui quid esset.
so sorry.	ita me paenitet.
It is not for us.	Non est nobis.
This is so.	Hoc ita est.
To want well is what you want.	Bene velle est quod vis.
No one ever was.	Nulla quis semper erat.
Listen to him.	Audire eum.
He doesn't have a hard time.	Difficile non habet.
What's new.	Quid novi.
That's what I think.	Id puto.
You have this one time.	Hoc unum tempus habes.
Let me help you.	Fac me tibi.
Yesterday he came here	Heri huc venit
my dog ​​is over.	Canem meum est in.
But his work was very good.	Sed opus eius erat ipsum bonum.
Which would be better.	Quod melius esset.
How it was said.	Quomodo dictum est.
But it is not likely.	Sed non est verisimile.
never, never, never.	numquam, numquam, numquam.
I am a man.	Ego homo sum.
I hope that's true.	Spero quod verum est.
Time for something else.	Tempus ad aliud.
He only knew that he was true.	Solus sciebat se verum esse.
But it is not yours.	Sed tuum non est.
It was always a pleasure to see you.	Felix semper fuit videre.
I tried to talk about it.	Conatus sum loqui de illo.
I was so busy.	Ut occupatus eram.
And if anything can be done, that's fine.	Et si quid potest fieri, Bene.
That is, but okay.	Id est, sed bene.
I haven't seen it for years and haven't thought of it.	Non eam vidi nec annos cogitavi.
Can we do this together?	Simul hoc facere possumus!
I don't know how you can do it.	Nescio quomodo id facere potes.
It's fine.	Bene sit.
It may have been attempted.	Vel conatus esse.
I am sure this time.	Certum hoc tempus sum.
No one comes.	Nemo venit.
Maybe you can.	Fortasse potest.
One at a time.	Unum ad tempus.
I like to be here.	Placet hic esse.
Now it is mine.	Nunc mea est.
I think he is talking to everybody.	Puto eum omnibus loqui.
But not to be.	Sed non esse.
And it was that day.	Erat autem dies ille.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
They are for sure.	Pro certo sunt.
You can have whatever name you like.	Nomen habere potes quod tibi placet.
But he did not give.	Sed non dedit.
You know your way to that.	Scis modo tua illa.
One thing to say sorry.	Unum est dicere paenitet.
Maybe but some save.	Aliquam sed aliquam nisi.
Well, that was hard.	Bene, ut difficile erat.
He was not my dog.	Non erat canis meus.
Would be.	Facturum esse.
I haven't seen him in the afternoon.	Ego illum post meridiem non vidi.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
As much as I can tell you now.	Quantum nunc tibi possum dicere.
But it was not the same.	Sed non ipsum erat.
It's time to say great things.	Aliquam ut dictum magna.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
Now you need to do something about it.	Nunc de eo aliquid facere debes.
No one can.	Nemo potest.
I can't be with her.	Non possum cum illa.
No one thought himself very well of me.	Nemo se optime de me putabat.
I don't know where he is.	Nescio ubi est.
But it is not now.	Sed non iam est.
He likes to be willing.	Velit velit.
What's up with that.	Quid eum ad id.
I'm not getting anything.	Im 'non questus quicquam.
That was an interesting thing.	Eius amet rem ut.
he alone did it.	solus id fecit.
But see this.	Sed hoc vide.
No one knows where you are.	Nemo scit ubi sis.
We can do nothing here.	Hic nihil possumus.
I don't know what, but it is.	Nescio quid, sed est.
Who will be, will be.	Quis erit, erit.
She gave me a name.	Illa mihi nomen dedit.
He didn't know who he was, never been there, just went.	Nesciebat quis, numquam ibi, modo abiit.
The dog did the same.	Idem fecit canis.
The question is, you don't.	Quaestio est, non facis.
This does not surprise me.	Hoc me non miror.
I don't want to travel alone.	Non solum vis iter.
No more than that.	Nulla id ipsum quam.
It is much better.	Multo melius est.
It's 'good'.	Suus 'bonus'.
please be with us.	esse nobis placet.
This is not good indeed.	Non hoc bene quidem est.
This is not a good work.	Non est hoc opus bonum.
This is how the car drives.	Sic currus agit.
Please make an email.	Quaeso, quis.
But he would not go.	Noluit autem ire.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
I know for sure.	Vere scio.
He could not see.	Videre non potuit.
I know that I have.	Scio me habet.
He did it for the time being.	Pro tempore fecit.
That is for sure.	Id est pro certo.
But that's none of it.	Sed id ipsum nulla.
That was hardly okay.	Vix id erat bene.
There was always nothing in it.	Nulla in semper erat.
All this made you who you are today.	Haec omnia te fecit qui sis hodie.
He was there again.	Ibi iterum fuit.
He came into my office.	Venit in officium meum.
He would do anything.	Facturum aliquid.
But things are nothing new to me.	Sed res mihi nihil novi sunt.
I'm so happy to meet him.	Im tam felix esse ei occurrit.
It's time to say something before.	Aliquam dictum aliquam ante.
It's something you really want.	Est aliquid vere.
Which is very true.	Quod valde verum est.
I was okay with it.	Cum eo bene fui.
I don't want him to see me like this.	Nolo illum me sic videre.
We cannot stay here.	Hic manere non possumus.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
That's the work.	Sibi opus esse.
I don't want you here.	Nolo hic te.
You must leave yourself.	Te relinquere debes.
like us to you.	sicut nos tibi.
It's enough.	Est satis.
Certainly he was not sure.	Certe non erat certus.
We are still here.	Adhuc hic sumus.
My dad got it.	Pater mihi obtinuit eam.
I believe enough.	Satis credo.
But he was also.	Sed et erat.
I don't see it happening yet.	Fieri tamen non video.
It's going to happen soon.	Cito futurum est.
we have so much time.	tantum tempus habemus.
Maybe that's been said.	Aliquam id dictum est.
I am always.	Ego semper sum.
But no one really knows.	Sed nemo vere scit.
and he knows all things.	et omnia novit.
He realized that this could not be done.	Id fieri posse intellexit.
He always tries to buy something on his way.	Iter suum in aliquid emere semper conatur.
This is your job.	Hoc est officium tuum.
It is not.	Non sit.
You'd never do that.	Numquam facere velis.
Or some thing.	Vel rem aliquam.
He was in that way, too.	Erat illo modo in, etiam.
And he is my boy.	Et puer meus est.
Are you okay?' 	Esne bene?'
she said.	illa dixit.
But there is no need.	Sed non opus est.
I do the same thing too.	Idem ego quoque.
I might as well.	Essem etiam.
I think right about it.	Recte de illo puto.
No that's something.	Nulla id est aliquid.
None of his business.	Eius nemo rem.
You didn't do anything.	Non fecisti aliquid.
I knew wrong.	Sciebam malum.
Please be happy, you're fine!	Sis felix, bene sis!
We, indeed, and you.	Nobis quidem et et.
But you can't.	Sed non potes.
Don't help me.	Non me adiuvet.
I need to know.	Scire debeo.
Nothing else can be done.	Nihil aliud fieri.
He saw what he was.	Vidit quod erat.
I love everything about him.	Omnia de eo amo.
To be somewhat	Esse aliquam.
Well, well, well.	Bene, bene, bene.
You have to stay here with us.	Habes hic nobiscum manere.
He wanted to believe in himself.	Credere sibi voluit.
He alone knew that he did not want to be alone.	Solus sciebat quod solus esse nolebat.
You know that this is true.	Scis hoc verum esse.
He does quite well.	Satis bene facit.
The design is easy to understand.	Consilium facile est intelligere.
After yesterday	Post heri .
I don't feel it.	Non sentio.
We can't leave it this way.	Hoc sic relinquere non possumus.
Really, really think.	Vere, vere cogitare.
But this is really how it was done.	Sed hoc est vere quomodo factum est.
We can do this together.	Simul hoc facere possumus.
If you want to go, you have to go.	Si vis ire, habes ire.
This is not so much.	Hoc non tam.
One to go with.	Unum ut cum.
how much are you.	quantum tu es.
What do you do?	Quid facis?
Nothing could have been done without him.	Nihil sine eo fieri potuit.
And now he is gone.	Et nunc, abiit.
I want something to be.	Volo aliquid esse.
It was not until now.	Nunc nec erat quam.
But it is nothing.	Sed nihil est.
This has been said too much.	Nimium hoc dictum.
To make it up.	Fac eum ut.
If you know anything.	Si quid scis.
Nothing can be done.	Nihil fieri.
He could not find her.	Non potuit eam invenire.
No it's from some.	Nulla a aliquam est.
We are all one.	Omnes unum sumus.
If everything goes well.	Si omnia bene.
that was my plan.	id erat consilium meum.
But it seemed true.	Sed verum videbatur.
You'll never do that.	Numquam id facere.
He was not sure whether it was still true or not.	Nesciebat an adhuc verum esset vel non.
But it is not.	Sed non est est.
He was to her now.	Ad eam nunc erat.
i feel too good.	nimium bene sentio.
Maybe it was now.	Aliquam erat nunc.
I do not, nor do you.	Non facio, nec tu.
This is what you need.	Hoc tibi opus est.
He eats well, but says little.	Bene comedit, sed parum dicit.
Just trying to understand how.	Sicut intelligere conatur quomodo.
what is it all about?.	Quid id est de omnibus ?.
so.	sic.
She met him recently.	Occurrit ei illa nuper.
i have good.	habeo bonum.
There is no such thing except him.	Nulla id nisi ipsum.
It was truly before.	Vere ante erat.
I don't like him anymore.	Eum non amo amplius.
At last he was his true self.	Tandem se, verum suum.
But that's behind us.	Sed id post nos.
He loves him.	Amat eum.
But there was none other than that.	Sed non erat quam.
It is better now.	Modo melius sit.
Which also happened.	Quod etiam factum est.
I have not been there.	Non ibi fui.
For sure!	Pro certo!
It is good.	Bonum est.
I know that he is.	Scio eum esse.
He has no money in him.	In eo pecuniam non habet.
you have in yourself.	habes in te.
It will not be enough.	Non satis erit.
I don't think that way.	Non putat hoc modo.
But even if he wants.	Sed vel nisi velit.
I know it can be done.	Scio fieri posse.
no one has attempted.	nemo conatus est.
You don't have time, you don't have time.	Non habes, tempus non habes.
There was no time to find out.	Tempus non erat invenire.
I am not like you.	Non sum sicut tu.
So it is.	Ita est.
Yes, but it was him.	Etiam sed ipsum erat.
Too little is necessary.	Nimis parum est.
I never thought I could do it.	numquam te putavi facere posse.
not nearly enough.	Non fere satis.
But also.	Sed et.
I need to stay out of this.	Ego ex hoc manere debeo.
He was not even himself.	Etiam nec ipsum erat.
Can't see me.	Me videre non potest.
I really want to talk to you.	Ego vere volo tecum loqui.
I will not.	Nolo.
I just like you.	Modo ut es.
He is already here.	Iam hic est.
and at this time.	et hoc tempore.
He doesn't want to talk.	Loqui non vult.
It's time to be honest with yourself.	Aliquam sit amet ipsum ex.
The work was no longer than it seemed.	Nec diutius opus fuit quam ut videbatur.
You have done great things.	Magna fecisti.
Or it may be.	Vel potest.
He didn't want to be in it.	Noluit in eo esse.
Without him ever.	Sine umquam ei.
Do you know who they are.	Scisne sunt.
What was done with you was true.	Quod apud te factum est, verum erat.
He asked if he wanted to go with her.	Quaesivit si vellet ire cum illa.
It was not enough.	Non satis fuit.
I really hope you're well.	Ego vere spero te bene.
Now it's up to you.	Nunc ad te est.
Take some time to go there.	Aliquam tempus ut nulla.
Who is this man?	Quis hic homo est?
That's great.	Id magna.
He wanted it.	Voluit eam.
I don't feel right to say this kind.	Non sentio recte hoc genus dicere.
You are the closest thing to yourself.	Proxima es tibi res.
That's pretty good.	Quod satis bene.
The man was different.	Aliud erat homo.
Maybe it wasn't enough.	Fortasse non satis ita factum est.
What's that.	Quid illa.
And you can see this too.	Et hoc quoque videre potes.
I would not see.	videre nolui.
This is my job.	Hoc est officium meum.
He did not eat all day.	Totum diem non comedit.
We're fine.	Bene sumus.
I think he did it correctly.	Recte id fecisse puto.
Your name.	Nomen tuum.
I like you a lot.	Ego amo te multum.
All right, though.	Recte, sed.
not enough is enough.	Non satis est satis.
It made me think.	Is me fecit cogitare.
In this way it is.	Hoc modo est.
But also himself.	Sed et ipsum.
But we	Sed nos .
I just can't.	Modo non possum.
He did not leave.	Non reliquit.
Again, it is not true at all.	Iterum, omnino non est verum.
It will be so.	Sic erit.
I was late.	Sero eram.
But here soon.	Sed hic mox.
I myself do not know.	Ego ipse non novi.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Noluit mihi loqui.
But that is some.	Sed id aliquam est.
I'm just not exactly sure what this is.	Im 'iustus non prorsus certus sum quid hoc sit.
The best you can do.	Quod optime facere potes.
i love to talk.	loqui amo.
To act at the same time.	Simul agere.
He would not.	Noluit.
What do you do?	Quid facias?
It is necessary.	Opus est.
This is the case.	Sic res se habet.
He did not understand why he was there.	Non intellexit cur ibi esset.
This is not exactly true.	Hoc non est prorsus verum.
He was not.	Non erat.
This is a good day.	Is dies enim bonus est.
This should also be done.	Hic quoque fieri debet.
I knew it would be right.	Sciebam recte fore.
He knows, he knows.	Scit, scit.
We have a lot to do in the morning.	Multum habemus facere mane.
That's how it is.	Id ut est.
To even refer to him.	Ut vel dictum ipsum.
I am a man.	Homo sum.
He gave him lunch.	Prandium ei dedit.
It is easy to see why this is so.	Facile est videre quare hoc ita sit.
what he did not know.	quid, nesciebat.
What is! 	Quid est!
It is the same here.	Simile est hic.
That's before now.	Id ante nunc.
It was a really good thing for me.	Vere bona res mihi fuit.
I like this way.	Mihi placet hoc modo.
I wanted to have more than that which was mine.	Plus volui, quam quod erat, habere meum.
Now or before.	Nunc vel erat ante.
I love my dog.	Canem meum amo.
It has been there for some time now.	Ibi iam aliquo tempore fuit.
If this, do it.	Si hoc, fac illud.
And it is too much, and too little.	Et nimium est, et parum.
He thought it would be like this when he started.	Putabat quando sic incepit fore.
If you said so, you are not right.	Si ita dixisti, non recte.
I know it can seem hard to believe, but it can.	Scio posse videri difficile credere, sed potest.
I've never heard it.	Id nunquam audivi.
I was really happy.	Vere felix fui.
That's what.	Id quod.
My dad made me go.	Pater meus me fecit ire.
He likes to do it either.	Velit facere vel.
They are not working.	Non opus sunt.
Everything is gone.	Omnia abiit.
Well, not really.	Bene, non vere.
You are doing well with him.	Bene facis cum eo.
He could not do this.	Hoc facere potuit.
It was never really anything.	Non erat aliquid umquam vere.
But if you do nothing, it will be nothing.	Sed si nihil feceris, nihil erit.
I haven't met one yet.	Unum adhuc non occurrit.
Which is so.	Quod sic est.
Or it could be.	Vel enim posse.
Say your name.	Dic nomen tuum.
i'm lucky.	Sum felix.
I've never seen you.	Nunquam te vidi.
At last he came to her.	Tandem venit ad eam.
This was my first time working with him.	Is mihi totum opus primum cum eo fuit.
It probably won't be this long either.	Probabile non erit hoc tempore vel diu.
Well, it looks very good.	Bene, valde bene videtur.
we can win.	vincere possumus.
He could not even speak.	Ne loqui potuit.
If he were not, he would not do it.	Si non esset, non faceret.
It is the same with us.	Simile est de nobis.
I will not talk to you about it.	Non sum tecum loqui de eo.
Maybe that's it.	Aliquam id est.
It could not be enough.	Non potuit satis.
It won't last much longer.	Multo diutius non erit.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
It's not just mine.	Hoc non modo meum factum est.
It was never enough.	Numquam satis factum est.
But even so it is.	Sed vel ipsum est.
He was not sure what to do now.	Quid nunc faceret certe non erat.
Nothing ever.	Nihil umquam.
Are you ready?	Paratus es?.
Or who.	Vel quis.
I have not seen you there.	ibi te non vidi.
Why is it a good question?	Quare bona quaestio est.
It can't be.	Non potest esse.
Maybe he was going to do it.	Forsitan id facturum esse.
Yes, you're not really a man.	Etiam vere homo non es.
But still everything.	Sed tamen omnia.
I feel really bad.	Vere malum sentio.
Now it is difficult to say.	Nunc difficile est dicere.
I didn't know him at the time.	Et ego nesciebam eum tempore.
I know you do.	Scio te facere.
You are not there.	Non ibi.
Say what you want.	Dic quid vis.
I don't know how.	Nescio quomodo.
None of this was for us.	Nulla id erat nobis.
I thought it was time for me.	Putabam me esse tempus.
That's what happened.	Id factum.
And this is often true.	Et hoc saepe verum est.
He thought so much of himself.	Tantum se putabat.
Don't stop doing it.	Noli prohibere facere.
This dog did well.	Canis hic bene fecit.
But this cannot be rightly done.	Sed id recte fieri non potest.
What he said is not true.	Quod dixit verum non est.
which I tried to do.	quae facere conatus sum.
We can find him.	Eum invenire possumus.
But I don't have time for that.	Sed non tempus quam.
It was not the first time it was true.	Primum non fuit verum.
It is not necessary.	Non necesse est.
Certainly he has money.	Certe pecuniam habet.
But yes, it was.	Etiam sed est erat.
Yes, it was not always.	Etiam nec semper erat.
This man did.	Homo hoc fecit.
Too good for me.	Nimis bonus est mihi.
He never does.	Numquam facit.
As I can no longer live.	Sicut iam vivere non possum.
If you have anything, tell us.	Si quid habes, dic nobis.
It's something to do or not.	Est aliquid vel facere vel facere non.
Good to be here.	Bonus ut hic sis.
It seems to have been said enough.	Videtur satis dictum.
I don't think anything could be more important than that.	Non puto quicquam plus posse quam illud.
Time just never seems to be enough.	Tempus tantum numquam satis esse videtur.
She's forgotten.	Illa oblitus est.
He did not think that he would do it.	Non putabat se facturum.
That's what they are.	Id est quid sunt.
We are men and in this we are one.	Homines sumus et in hoc una sumus.
One day he went and did not come.	Una die abiit et non venit.
It was time to speak.	Tempus erat dicere.
Never, ever.	Numquam, semper.
Look at my book.	Vide librum meum.
You know as you like.	Scis, sicut tibi placet.
I know you can't talk about it.	Scio te de illo loqui non posse.
I'm sorry for what you did.	Paenitet me malum fecisti.
I'm not there yet.	Non sum ibi adhuc.
You have done well.	Recte fecisti.
But that was different.	Fuit autem illud aliud.
Now it is not going to happen.	Modo non futurum.
And he did it again.	Et fecit iterum.
I don't think well.	Non videtur bene.
I'm very sorry.	Valde me paenitet.
I think you've done well.	Puto te bene fecisse.
He saw it too.	Vidit id quoque.
He needs to know what to do.	Scire debet quid agere.
I wanted money.	Pecuniam volui.
This week is going to be really good.	Hoc septimana vere bonum est futurum.
No that was said.	Nulla id dictum erat.
There was no preparation.	Erat nulla paratus.
Which is possible.	Qui fieri potest.
Now we can learn.	Nunc scire possumus.
He has good advice.	Bene habet consilium.
So it is today.	Sic est hodie.
I don't know what time it is.	Quod tempus sit nescio.
But at this time he did not see me.	Sed hoc tempore me non vidit.
That's where we are now.	Id ubi nunc sumus.
Do you want to go with me?	Visne mecum ire?
Even this doesn't seem too bad.	Etiam hoc non videtur nimis malum.
He knows there.	Novit ibi.
i never knew it was enough.	numquam satis esse sciebam.
I knew what it was.	sciebam quid esset.
I knew it was all for me.	Sciebam in me totum esse.
I will do it.	id faciam.
I said nothing.	Nihil dixi.
which I could never do now.	quod nunc facere numquam potui.
I could not do it.	facere non potui.
I think you are right.	Recte puto.
I know where you are.	Scio ubi es.
You can have it.	Potes habere.
Don't talk to me.	Noli mecum loqui.
He said that it was okay.	Dixit quod bene esset.
And a lot has been done.	Et multum factum est.
He will help us.	Ille erit nobis auxilio.
I could not find how the work is.	quomodo opus sit invenire non potui.
I am the only person.	Homo sum solus.
All of us.	Omnes nos.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
I see nothing wrong.	Nihil mali video.
It's not easy for me to do this.	Hoc mihi non facile est facere.
Without you.	Sine te.
Everything is gone.	Omnia abiit.
She said yes.	Illa etiam dixit.
Good to see you again.	Bonum est videre iterum.
This work appears.	Hoc opus videtur.
It's good to be busy here.	Hoc bonum est hic esse occupatus.
I have not seen this before.	Hoc ante non vidi.
I don't want to be alone.	Solus esse nolo.
Never do that yourself.	Numquam id ipsum.
That's just what you want to say.	Hoc modo vis dicere.
Do you want us?	Visne nos?.
He likes him.	Velit eum.
Or, as it seems.	Vel, ut videtur.
I need to talk to you.	Mihi opus est ad te loqui.
But, a great question.	Sed, magna quaestio.
This he did.	Hoc fecit.
I don't want anything.	Nolo quicquam.
He was not himself.	Non erat ipsum.
May get in.	Sit ut in.
now I don't know what's happened.	nunc quid acciderit nescio.
Yes exactly.	Ita prorsus.
No no, no.	Non non, non.
i'm never alone.	numquam solus sum.
There will be.	Ibi erit.
Which is always true.	Quae semper.
but he understood this.	sed hoc intellexit.
I don't talk much.	Non multum loqui.
But that's none of it.	Sed ut ipsum nulla.
I'm not sure yet.	Non sum certus adhuc.
Let's start the season!	Sit amet tempus sit!.
He thought this was going to happen.	Id futurum putavit.
This was what he wanted.	Hoc erat quod voluit.
I just don't know when that day will be.	Modo nescio quando dies ille erit.
Certainly you can.	Certe potes.
We don't have anything else to talk about.	Non habemus aliud loqui.
Everything was exactly like that.	Omnia prorsus ut erat.
And it seems that it is not.	Et videtur quod non.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
This is certain.	Hoc certum est.
See in serial.	Vide in Vide.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
But not great.	Sed non magna.
Please don't do it to me.	Fac quaeso ne id mihi facias.
you can go through.	per potes.
This is true.	Hoc verum est.
But even so it was.	Sed vel erat enim.
It seems pretty easy.	Satis facile videtur.
Well, that's not the case.	Bene, rem sibi non vult.
Yes it is necessary.	Etiam opus est.
We need it.	Nobis opus est.
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
But, indeed, it was.	Sed sed enim erat.
I don't know which one.	Nescio quod unum.
It's too late now.	Sero nimis nunc est.
Well, maybe one.	Bene, fortasse unus.
He could do everything.	Posset autem omnia.
He saw her.	Vidit eam.
he already knew.	iam sciebat.
He could do nothing about this.	Nihil de hoc facere potuit.
He said something, but could not hear.	Aliquid dixit, sed audire non potuit.
He never did it.	Id nunquam fecit.
I knew it could be easy.	Facile scivi potuit.
Not so today.	Non ita hodie.
But that is the same.	Sed ut ipsum est.
I wanted more than to leave something here.	Plus volui quam hic aliquid relinquere.
Not much, really.	Non multum, vere.
She truly wanted to believe him.	Illa vere credere ei voluit.
is very good.	Is est valde bona.
But it is not so.	Sed non ita esse.
But he or she wants.	Sed vel velit.
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
It was very late.	Sero erat multum.
But she refused to say one thing.	Sed unum dicere illa noluit.
Do me this way.	Fac me hoc modo.
But his.	Sed eius .
Is it okay?	Estne bene?.
That time is not like today.	Id tempus non sicut hodie.
We don't have a lot of time.	Non multum temporis habemus.
It's hard to get what you want.	Difficile ut vis.
And he made time.	Et fecit tempus.
More money was needed.	Plus pecuniae opus erat.
I like it better, don't you?	Melius mihi placet, non tu?
I was up for breakfast in the morning.	Mane ad prandium eram.
I am after you, man.	post te sum, homo.
Whether it's a.	Utrum' a.
Absolutely what you want.	Omnino quid velis.
Money is not the only problem.	Non solum quaestio pecuniae.
i am not yet.	Ego non adhuc.
But neither was he himself.	Sed nec ipsum erat.
I don't know exactly what your business is.	Quae res prorsus tua sit nescio.
I thought I was something wrong.	Putabam me esse aliquid mali.
i believe it will be.	credo erit.
For it is a certain evil.	Malum enim certum est.
Not all bad.	Non omnes mali.
It is not possible at all.	Omnino fieri non potest.
I need it.	Mihi opus est.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
But both can be together.	Utrumque autem potest esse simul.
I don't like it this morning.	Non placet hoc mane.
It was a pretty busy morning.	Satis mane occupatus erat.
And that's what I am.	Et id est quod me.
I feel even better.	Melius etiam sentio.
He did the same thing tomorrow too.	Idem faceret cras quoque.
And see how it was done.	Et quomodo factum esset vide.
Not yet why, but.	Non tamen cur, sed.
Alone, it's kind of late.	Solus, sero genus est.
Was.	Esset.
Nothing has been done.	Nihil factum est.
This is my plan today.	Hoc consilium meum hodie est.
and i'd like to be in this way.	et libet esse hoc modo.
Something has been done badly.	Aliquid male factum est.
I think this is good.	Hoc bonum puto.
I can get a job if I need it.	Possum officium, si opus sit.
That doesn't make it easy.	Quod facile non facit.
I'll tell you something more.	Dicam tibi plus aliquid.
And perhaps it was true.	Et fortasse verum fuit.
Tell me he was happy.	Dic mihi felix erat.
Tell yourself.	Dic te ipsum.
To give and to receive.	Dare et accipere.
The same with this.	Idem cum hoc.
He did something.	Aliquid fecit.
Well, a little.	Bene, parum.
But it is like doing something.	Sed simile est facere aliquid.
Longer than me.	Diutius quam me.
He did not want this to be so.	Noluit hoc sic esse.
He seems to know a lot about him.	Multum de eo scire videtur.
And now it's okay.	Modo autem bene.
Well, really.	Bene, vere.
But it was not the same.	Sed non ipsum erat.
he has enough.	satis habet.
No one asked why.	Cur nemo quaesivit.
There is going to be a lot of things here, man.	Multum hic futurum est, vir.
This time with you.	Id tempus tecum.
Never let us down.	Numquam nos.
I'll be working late tonight.	Ego nuper hac nocte opus erit.
I tried to be a good man and father.	Conatus sum vir bonus et pater esse.
Yes it is how I feel.	Ita est, quomodo me sentio.
Do something for yourself.	Facere aliquid te ipsum.
I think his name is.	Nomen eius puto.
But this does not seem to be right.	Sed hoc non videtur recte facere.
Up to this point.	Huc usque.
I don't.	Non facio.
It's very good for me.	Mihi valde bene est.
Do yourself a great job.	Fac tibi magna.
Certainly.	Certe.
She never did anything she didn't want to do.	Illa numquam quicquam fecit quod facere noluit.
But that was so.	Sed id erat ut.
I appreciate your job.	Ego tuum officium bene.
If you don't want to do it, just say it.	Si non vis facere, dic modo.
Now it's okay.	Nunc bene est.
I will say, you do.	Dicam, facis.
That's already done.	Quod iam factum est.
He could not stop.	Non potuit prohibere.
It's how to do it.	Est quam id.
But this often cannot be done.	Sed id saepe fieri non potest.
How can we stop this from happening again?	Quomodo prohibere possumus hoc iterum fieri?
That's what he was doing.	Id erat facere.
He would not hear this.	Noluit hoc audire.
No shipment has been made.	Nulla sit amet dictum est.
I just don't want it behind me.	Ego iustus nolo eam post me.
It was only a good decision.	Nisi consilium bonum fuit.
But this is his.	Sed haec est eius.
This is going to happen.	Hoc futurum est.
As a whole.	Ut totum.
Couldn't get up.	Fieri non potuit ut usque.
What is? 	Quid est?
That's it now.	Id, nunc.
But I see what you mean.	Sed video quid velis.
I don't know what, but it's true.	Nescio quid, sed verum est.
I know who it is.	Scio quis sit.
I haven't done anything.	Non aliquid feci.
What he seems to want to think.	Quod videtur velle cogitare.
This is.	Hic est.
But that's not good.	Id autem non.
It was only in New Orleans.	Aliquam in erat nisi.
But this is how we can help you.	Hoc tamen est, quantum tibi possumus.
It is a race.	Genus est.
It seemed.	Videbatur.
You are.	Es.
She didn't even want to think.	Illa ne cogitare quidem voluit.
yes but only that.	Etiam non nisi quam.
But don't do it.	Sed ne id facias.
Certainly they are good.	Certe bona sunt.
I don't think this is correct.	Hoc non recte puto.
I wanted to make one too.	unum quoque facere volui.
You can't see this.	Hoc videre non potes.
And he was here.	Erat autem hic.
As he does.	Sicut facit.
He can't hear me.	Non potest me audire.
In their own way.	Suo modo.
I can't really talk to you.	Non possum vere loqui tecum.
Which is so.	Quod ita est.
He can't go.	Ire non potest.
If you want to talk, well.	Si loqui vis, bene.
He did not know where he was.	Nesciebat ubi esset.
he could not.	non potuit.
He thought what a good father he was.	Putabat quid bonus pater esset.
He was alone there.	Solus ibi erat.
And see.	Et vide.
I was always pretty.	Satis semper fui.
It's very good.	Ipsum bonum est.
I'll do it if you do.	Faciam, si feceris.
that is the thing.	id est rem.
i want both.	utrumque volo.
I wonder how well it's going to be.	Miror quam bene futurum est.
But it is also different.	Sed aliud quoque est.
I don't feel very well today.	Non sentio optime hodie.
Where we are.	Ubi sumus.
For never.	Numquam enim.
This one is the first.	Hoc unum est primum.
There was one boy, a boy.	Puer unus erat, puer.
Get in now.	Ut in nunc.
This was good.	Hoc erat bonum.
He said again.	Dixit iterum.
I don't need to be here.	Non opus est ut hic.
I really like to go.	Ego vere amo ire.
Not before.	Non ante.
First off I don't know who you really are.	Primum nescio quis vere.
Like, a good man.	Similis, homo, bonus.
It's better if not at the same time, for sure.	Melius est si non simul, certe.
But he is not here.	Sed non hic est.
I know it's too late.	Sero scio.
This is your time.	Hoc est tempus tuum.
as it seems.	ut videtur.
I just thought it was good to see you.	Ego iustus putavit esse bonum te videre.
To-morrow it is the same thing.	Cras id ipsum.
Not so much anything.	Non ita aliquid.
And to him there is none.	Et ad ipsum nulla.
They are also men.	Homines quoque sunt.
Well, rightly so.	Bene, recte quidem.
Now get there.	Iam illuc.
And, yes.	Et, Etiam.
I'll do it myself.	Faciam ut ipse faciam.
Yes it is.	Ita sit.
I only hope it doesn't stay longer.	Tantum spero non diutius manere.
There's none at all.	In non aliquam nulla.
It occurs that year.	Occurrit eo anno.
Now without me.	Modo sine me.
You made it.	Tu eam fecisti.
This really is not true.	Hoc vere non est verum.
And so that.	Et ut.
I never got enough money.	Numquam satis pecuniae.
But it can be evil.	Sed malum esse potest.
That's what.	Id quod.
Do it quickly.	Fac cito.
Well, no more.	Bene, amplius.
I don't believe you know that.	Non credo te scire.
What else should I do here.	Quid aliud hic facere debeo.
He could not.	Non potuit.
I could have	potui habere .
It does not please.	Non placet.
You just can't hear.	Vos iustus audire non potest.
Yes, that was out of it.	Etiam id ex erat.
I was not there.	Ibi non fui.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
This is not right now.	Hoc nunc non est.
It is without us.	Est sine nobis.
I can't hear.	nec possum audire.
You are not right.	Non recte.
But he thought that it was.	Sed putabat ut sit.
He could not go anywhere.	Huc ire non potuit.
You know nothing about him.	Nihil scis de eo.
But there is no need.	Sed non est opus.
I could never do it.	numquam facere potui.
It's fine, I don't need you.	Bene est, non opus est tibi.
But no one wants to.	Sed ut velit nulla.
There was a dog that came and told us.	Canis erat qui venit et nobis dixit.
He couldn't really do it.	Vere facere non potuit.
I've done it.	Ego feci.
I wanted her to be for us again.	Volui eam iterum esse pro nobis.
I like everything about him.	Mihi placet omnia de eo.
That's how it is.	Ut id quam est.
We need nothing.	Nobis nihil opus est.
It is important to be there.	Aliquam sit amet est est.
How	Quomodo.
This is if you'd like my help.	Hoc est si auxilium meum velis.
Probably something that you never did.	Probabiliter aliquid, quod numquam fecisti.
He thought so too.	Ita etiam putabat.
That's what you fight for.	Id quod pro.
I knew exactly what I was doing.	Prorsus sciebam quid facerem.
Now he is gone.	Nunc abiit.
This could not have been done.	Hoc fieri non potuit.
There was one and only one.	Unus erat ibi, et unus solus.
Which is the first.	Quod est primum.
Someone who is up to nothing.	Aliquis qui ad nihil.
I didn't want to do anything.	Aliquid in me facere noluisse.
For he was.	Erat enim.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
I could do something else.	Aliud facere potui.
You know what you are doing.	Scis quid facias.
What a man does to him.	Quod ei homo facit.
The boy and the father.	Puer et pater.
I tried nothing to think about.	Conatus est nihil cogitare.
It was both ways.	Utrumque fuit.
You have done nothing wrong.	Nihil mali fecisti.
As always, as always.	Ut semper, erat ut semper.
Lunch was late.	Prandium nuper fuit.
to see unconditional love.	ut video es- se.
What do you think? 	Quid tibi videtur?
I haven't seen you in quite a while.	Non vidi admodum tempus.
Not the same yet.	Non idem tamen.
I had a job to do.	Ego quoque officium facere.
Thus he did.	Sic fecit.
Certainly it was not for me.	Mihi certe non fuit.
He did as he pleased.	Fecit ut voluit.
we can buy.	emere possumus.
I'm going to take you with me.	Eo ut te mecum.
No one really does.	Nemo vere facit.
I don't know about myself either.	Nescio de me quidem.
Now he's coming to reality.	Iam is ad rem venit.
Go where he wants.	Ire quo vult.
It was certainly different.	Aliud certe fuit.
I will not do this.	Hoc non faciam.
It was my job.	Meum erat officium.
He has seen this for a long time.	Hoc iam diu vidit.
Look at this.	Hoc vide.
But not at all.	Sed non nulla.
Exactly like yesterday.	Prorsus sicut heri.
You're ready this time.	Hoc tempore paratus es.
if you can talk.	si loqui potes.
Yes, but it is time.	Etiam sed tempus est.
But this is hardly enough.	Sed hoc vix satis est.
I need it.	Mihi opus est.
I have said the same thing here.	Hoc idem hic dixi.
There was no force.	Nulla vis erat.
Great indeed.	Magna quidem.
Do you want to come?	Vis venire?
These are good.	Haec sunt bona.
I suspect that I was the only one.	Solus suspicor fuisse me.
She didn't even ask for her name.	Illa ne nomen quidem quaesivit.
This is correct.	Hoc bene est.
There was not much time there.	Tantum non nunc ibi erat.
But now was the time.	Sed iam tempus erat.
For what evil can he do?	Quid enim mali facere potest?
there was need for a plan.	consilium ei opus erat.
It was a good job.	Bonum erat officium.
What a thing you do.	Quam rem facis.
He did nothing.	Nihil fecit.
And all is well.	Et omnia bene.
I don't want to leave him alone again.	Nolo eum adhuc solum relinquere.
That was the same thing.	Id ipsum erat.
Before the day	Ante diem.
Yes i'm sure about that.	Ita sum certus de illo.
That's the job.	Id est officium.
I never know anything like this happens.	Numquam novi aliquid simile hoc fieri.
So much time is needed.	Ita multo tempore opus est.
He did not know where he was.	Nesciebat ubi.
And I say a lot to him.	Multum ei quoque dicam.
She's always been really good to me.	Mihi vere bona illa semper fuit.
It's not my race, though.	Non est genus meum, sed.
you like it.	tibi placet.
I guess we're.	Suspicor nos nimium.
I hope to see you there.	Spero te videre ibi.
Well, not to you.	Bene, non tibi.
Not long.	Non diu.
Please don't help me.	Non placet auxilium.
There was one thing for sure.	Unum certe fuit.
If you believe in your family.	Si tua in.
But this does not seem to be the case here.	Sed hoc non videtur hic fieri.
I hope help comes, though.	Spero auxilium venit, sed.
I had not.	non habui.
Don't say nothing.	Noli dicere nihil.
Maybe okay, but not this time.	Forsitan bene, sed non hoc tempore.
No one loves him.	Nemo eum amat.
No that's great.	Nulla id magna.
This has just been said.	Hoc modo dictum est.
Want to see how it was done?	Vis videre quomodo factum est?.
I'm getting a little out of myself right now.	Questus sum parum de me nunc.
That's not going to happen.	Quod non futurum est.
Nothing to buy.	Nihil emere.
It does not please.	Non placet.
I can't see you like this.	Non possum te videre sic.
To or to whom.	Ut vel quam.
It is not.	Non est.
We cannot do this.	Hoc facere non possumus.
That's a good thing.	Id bonum.
Now you are not.	Nunc non es.
It has been a long time.	Non diu fuit.
By doing so.	Id per.
yes not the same.	Etiam non ipsum.
Who is good.	Qui bonus.
You don't have.	Non habes.
There is no ID out there.	Nulla id ex nulla.
That's great for us.	Ut nobis magna.
We like it.	Nobis similis est.
Will definitely do this again.	Certum erit hoc iterum facere.
Really can't do it now.	Vere nunc facere non potest.
He likes to be himself.	Velit ut quis ipsum.
I'm in it now, she thought.	Sum in eo nunc, putavit.
It was time.	Tempus erat.
This one is for me.	Hoc unum mihi est.
I thought you were.	Putavi esse te.
That's good to see.	Quod bonum est videre.
He was also scared.	Vix erat etiam.
i did it.	ego feci.
I hope you're doing well.	Spero vos bene facere.
I'll tell you now.	Dicam modo.
I looked again.	Iterum vidi.
He came home.	Domum per- venit.
so we can't go.	sic ire non possumus.
but he knew it.	sed sciebat.
At last he did it.	Tandem fecit illud.
This post is not for you.	Post haec non est tibi.
Not as He did, but He did not.	Non, ut fecit, sed non fecit.
I doubt that it is easy.	quod facile dubito.
We cannot wait.	Manere non possumus.
And you are.	Et vos esse.
I've never met before.	Nunquam ante occurrit.
It seems that all this was done before.	Videtur hoc totum ante factum esse.
It's a good plan.	Bonum consilium est.
This was done by me.	Hoc a me factum est.
There is not enough money.	Satis pecuniae non est.
He left but he could not.	Reliquit non potuit.
I'm not soon enough.	Non sum satis cito.
They are not for him.	Non sunt pro eo.
and he went and went.	et abiit et abiit.
I don't like it either.	Non placet vel.
You know what you mean.	Scis vis.
There is no time for that.	Non sit tempus ut.
if you do.	si feceris.
We can go home.	Domum ire possumus.
I'm not so sure.	Non sum tam certus.
You need to think about it.	De illo debes cogitare.
We are somebody.	Sumus aliquem.
Please tell me if you think very much.	Valde placet mihi, si cogitas.
Yes, there was no time.	Etiam tempus erat nec erat.
But he could not.	Sed non potuit.
But that's not hard for you to do.	Id tamen facere tibi difficile non est.
That he says something.	Quod aliquid dicit.
Listening is enough.	Audire satis est.
and this is true.	et hoc verum est.
I need to know how this happened.	Hoc scire debeo quomodo acciderit.
I only met one.	Tantum occurrit unum.
And tomorrow he could not think, either.	Et cras non potuit cogitare, vel.
I hope you're doing well with it.	Spero te bene cum illo.
These are the things that really matter.	Haec sunt quae rem vere.
But there was only one.	Sed non erat nisi.
one, not much.	unus, non multum.
He said this to me.	Hoc mihi dixit.
This he had.	Hoc habuit.
And there is no need for this alone.	Et hoc solum opus non est.
how are you.	quam tu.
We have one among us.	Habemus inter nos.
She's got it from you.	Illa a te obtinuit.
And yet it is not enough.	Et adhuc parum est.
He knows he can do it.	Scit se facere posse.
That's not how.	Ut non quam.
he was in.	erat in.
I think we're good enough.	Puto nos satis esse.
what's wrong with you?	Quid tibi mali est?
We only do one thing.	Unum solum nobis facere.
I've been thinking about you for a long, long time.	Cogitavi de te diu, diu.
He did what he could.	Fecit id quod potuit.
You don't win.	Non vincere.
There is no great saying in it.	Nulla in dictum magna.
Very, very, very much.	Valde, valde, valde.
He didn't like each other.	Nolebat inter se.
You never did.	Numquam fecisti.
But not right.	Sed non recte.
Yes, please.	Etiam, velit quam.
He was better than almost anyone.	Melius erat fere quis.
Certainly both are necessary.	Certe utrumque opus est.
But not great.	Sed non magna.
This is how it was going to be.	Sic factum est quomodo futurum erat.
One of us should talk!	Unus ex nobis loqui debet!
Don't always do it yourself.	Ne id ipsum semper.
I didn't know how to stop.	Nesciebam quam prohibere.
That's always the same thing.	Ut id semper ipsum.
He does not do.	Non facit.
I'm not trying lately.	Non me nuper conatur.
Without it, he wants nothing.	Sine, nihil velit.
Truly he did so.	Vere ita fecit.
I know you want.	Scio te velle.
You are like.	Similis es.
And it will not be.	Et non erit.
Better to be someone.	Melius esse aliquem.
I really wanted.	Ego vere volui.
Even not before him.	Etiam nec ipsum ante.
I think you're fine.	Puto te bene esse.
Yes, there was a fixed time, there was no longer there.	Etiam tempus certum erat amplius non erat.
But now he knew what was going to happen.	Sed nunc sciebat quid esset futurum.
He did it during dinner.	Fecit inter cenam.
I'll tell you I don't need it.	Dicam tibi non opus esse.
That's what we're really here for.	Id quod vere hic sumus.
If yes, look for the road.	Etiam si est, vide iter.
This could not have been done.	Hoc fieri non potuit.
Maybe I would do the same thing.	Idem fortasse facerem.
as he now saw.	ut nunc vidit.
There is no question.	Nulla quaestio est.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est verum.
If you already know, great.	Si iam scis, magna.
The situation is correct.	Ita se res habet, recte.
Maybe not before or after.	Aliquam non ante vel post.
I think it's true.	verum puto.
He does not know why.	Nescit quare.
Better to be.	Melius esse.
I want you to talk to me.	Volo te mecum loqui.
he had time.	tempus habuit.
I can always leave.	Semper relinquere possum.
Yes I am so sorry.	Ita sum, ita me paenitet.
I hope you're doing well so far.	Spero te bene tantum.
Well after all.	Bene post omnia.
Don't be alone, just don't last too long.	Solus non solum ne diutius.
I feel well.	Sentio etiam.
I hope you stay here.	Spero te hic manere.
I fight for everything.	Ego pro omnibus.
But we cannot.	Sed non possumus.
He can't stay here.	Hic manere non potest.
No one does better.	Nemo melius facit.
You can get what you want.	Potes id quod vis.
That's something he thinks.	Id aliquid, cogitat.
and what was like to me would happen.	et quod mihi erat simile, futurum.
what for.	quid pro.
You are a teacher.	Tu magister es.
This work is for me.	Hoc opus est mihi.
But also in none.	Sed et ipsum in nulla.
Maybe not all.	Forsitan omnes.
One guy said he just wants to give me money.	Unus guy dixit se tantum velle mihi pecuniam dare.
As you do.	Ut facis.
Nothing more has been said of him.	Nihil amplius de eo dictum est.
There is no one like yourself.	Nulla quis ut ipsum.
I've never done it.	Nunquam ego feci.
I don't want to think yet.	Nolo tamen cogitare.
That's gonna be great.	Ut sit amet magna.
But neither was he before.	Sed nec ante erat.
This was not true.	Hoc non erat verum.
Someone needs to do something about it.	Debet aliquis aliquid facere de illo.
I don't feel sick.	Non sentio male.
They are not there.	Non sunt ibi.
Again we are all men.	Iterum omnes homines sumus.
All three of us.	Omnes nos tres.
And if it were not .	Et si non esset .
If so it is great.	Si ita est, magna.
I love him very much.	Eum valde amo.
And it was done.	Factum est autem.
and thus it was done.	et sic factum est.
He didn't want it.	Noluit eam.
But he was unwilling to do so.	Sed id nolebat.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I can do good.	Bonum facere possum.
This can be done today.	Hoc hodie fieri potest.
But to do it is not.	Sed facere non est.
But not great.	Sed non magna.
I never understood.	Numquam intellexit.
But there is still work to be done.	Sed adhuc opus faciendum est.
That was done.	Quod factum erat.
Not much yet.	Non multum tamen.
But do not speak here.	Sed noli hic loqui.
He did his job very well.	Bene nimis fecit officium suum.
I have not done well.	Non bene feci.
I hope to do better.	Melius est hoc facere spero.
It should be in none.	Sit in nulla.
Well, maybe not.	Sed bene fortasse.
His face was pretty.	Vultus eius satis erat.
And this is enough.	Et hoc satis.
This certainly is.	Hoc certe est.
It was time to do something now.	Tempus erat aliquid iam.
And that's what we have.	Id quoque habemus.
I've never told you.	Ego numquam dixi tibi.
What he did.	Quod fecit.
which I doubt correctly.	quod recte dubito.
But this is to be done.	Sed hoc est faciendum.
I can't speak.	Non possum dicere.
I will do it again.	Iterum ego faciam.
I don't believe I can do this.	Hoc facere posse non credo mihi.
It's good for me to see it.	Hoc mihi bonum est videre eam.
This is what he is saying there.	Hoc est quod ibi loquitur.
I am here for this.	Hic ego pro hoc.
It is never like this.	Numquam sic est.
She could do everything now.	Posset omnia nunc.
Nothing has been done.	Nihil factum est.
It is not.	Non sit.
But it could be.	Posset autem.
There was nothing new about him.	Nihil eo novi fuit.
He would not.	Noluit.
I would like to know.	Scire vellem.
and never.	numquam et.
But not before him.	Sed nec ipsum ante.
You have to know how to do it.	Scire habes quomodo id facias.
But I can't do it.	Sed facere non possum.
You cannot understand.	Non potes intelligere.
And my, well, mine was really good.	Et mea, bene, mea vere bona erat.
No one knows for sure.	Pro certo nemo scit.
This is my first day.	Die mihi hoc primum.
Yes, so good.	Sic, tam bonum.
and so it is still today.	et sic adhuc hodie est.
Do not do it.	Ne id facias.
It's not bad.	Malum non est.
Nothing else to do.	Nihil aliud agere.
You're more than me.	Plus quam tu me.
I wasn't sure if it was necessary or not.	Certus eram si opus esset vel non.
It's a pretty good decision.	Satis est bonum consilium.
It is still early yet.	Adhuc mane adhuc.
He loves you.	Amat te.
She finally realized.	Tandem illa intellexit.
A lot.	Sit amet.
Don't say anything.	Noli dicere.
How was it done at the same time?	Simul dictum quam factum est!
Now who was that.	Nunc quis erat quam.
And so it is in this.	Et sic in hoc est.
He is gone too.	Abiit etiam.
We can never know for sure.	Numquam certe scire possumus.
I don't know what it is.	Nescio quid sit.
Don't do this again.	Noli iterum hoc facere.
It's time to do something.	Aliquam nec aliquam est.
It would seem that even now he is not yet ready.	Videtur quod etiam nunc nondum paratus sit.
I also.	Ego quoque.
Now there was no one.	Nunc quis nulla erat.
I didn't want much.	Nolui multum.
There is no evidence of any kind.	Nulla id aliquam ex.
I don't know how to do it.	Nescio quomodo id facias.
This is how it was done.	Hoc quomodo factum est.
I can't talk to him.	Non possum dicere ei.
i'm pretty lucky.	Sum satis felix.
He was also there.	Erat quoque ibi.
He doesn't think about it.	Non cogitat.
It is easy to see why this is so.	Cur ita sit, facile est videre.
But now you know.	Sed nunc scis.
Why you.	Cur tu.
It won't be long.	Non diu erit.
I don't do that.	Non facere.
Not often yet.	Non saepe tamen.
I wanted this to be.	Hoc esse volui.
Not even that name.	Ne id quidem nomen.
I didn't want to talk to him either.	Nolui vel ei loqui.
But who only wants.	Sed quis nisi velit.
I did this to him.	Hoc ei feci.
There is none.	Nulla est.
I love everything about this video.	Omnia de hoc video amo.
I will not	Nolo .
This will not work.	Hoc opus non erit.
Hardly not.	Vix non.
he thought.	putavit.
I could not let you know.	Non potui te scire.
If no one looks, no one buys.	Si nemo spectat, nemo emit.
I feel very good about myself now.	Valde bene de me nunc sentio.
This can be good or bad.	Hoc potest esse bonum vel malum.
And he had.	Et habuit.
The boy was again.	Iterum puer erat.
Is it hard to buy?	Putasne is emere difficile est?
I know you well.	Novi te bene.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
Great too.	Magna etiam.
Look at that guy.	Vide illud guy.
But I can't do this.	Hoc autem facere non possum.
I didn't want to talk with you any time.	Nolui loqui cum aliquo tempore.
I think soon.	Mox puto.
I have it that way.	Habeo illuc.
He alone does not all.	Solus non omnes facit.
How he wants me to see.	Quam me videre vult.
Now that's the same thing.	Nunc id ipsum est.
Well, now that it's happened, we can't do anything about it.	Bene, nunc acciderit, nihil de eo facere possumus.
But one thing is for sure.	Unum tamen pro certo est.
I am not.	Non sum.
But they are not all the same.	Sed non omnes idem.
he thought to himself.	sibi putavit.
He made friends easily.	Facile amicos fecit.
Everything started well.	Omnia bene incepit.
Your work is done.	Tuum est opus.
Never.	Numquam.
This is not yours.	Hoc non est tuum.
Too good to be.	Nimis bonus esse.
He even wants it out of nowhere.	Etiam id velit ex nulla.
But not from now.	Sed non ex nunc.
But to no avail.	Sed ut nulla.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
He did not do this.	Hoc non fecit.
I am not the same.	Non sum idem.
He had friends there.	Ibi amicos habuit.
Your job is not fixed.	Tuum non est certum.
That was great.	Ut in magna erat.
he owes us	nobis debet.
between	inter
I just can't do it.	Ego iustus facere non possum.
Not unless.	Non, nisi.
He refused to receive anything else.	Noluit aliud accipere.
It's fine with me.	Bene est mecum.
I just tried now.	Modo conatus sum nunc.
This really is my job.	Hoc vere est officium.
Well, that's not entirely true.	Bene, non omnino verum est.
I don't need help.	Non opus est auxilio.
I would like to hear yours.	Vellem tua audire.
Did it yesterday.	Heri fecit illud.
I don't know what's there.	Nescio quid ibi est.
That's not enough please.	Quod non satis placet.
I wonder if this is true.	Miror si verum est.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
But it is today.	Sed id est hodie.
I wanted to say this.	hoc volui dicere.
I am not from you.	non sum a te.
I need to believe.	Mihi opus est credere.
It was a great story.	Aliquam magna erat.
All I can see.	Omnia possum videre.
Please what do you think?	Quid quaeso cogitas?
I know him to act.	Novi se agere.
You're never alone.	Tu solus numquam.
That day was not so.	Non ita fuit illa dies.
I need more money.	Plus pecuniae mihi opus est.
It's not the thing.	Non res.
We still need it.	Nos adhuc opus est.
I'm here when you want to talk.	Hic sum cum loqui vis.
I said you'd like to know something.	Dixi te aliquid scire velis.
No one said much.	Nemo multa dixit.
I don't know why he did this.	Nescio cur hoc fecerit.
I saw I got it.	Ego vidi obtinuit.
He could not leave her.	Se ei relinquere potuit.
I had no time for that.	Id tempus non habui.
I could still see her.	Adhuc non potui videre eam.
I'm just happy to be here.	Non sum felix hic esse.
He could do anything.	Quicquam potuit.
I know that.	Scio esse.
Now here, now.	Modo hic, nunc.
But who only	Sed quis nisi.
I've never seen this.	Nunquam hoc vidi.
Well, here it is.	Bene, hic est.
I could not stop.	Non potui prohibere.
But now he is gone.	Sed nunc abiit.
She could be here.	Posset hic esse.
I know what.	Scio quid.
Yes that's some great.	Etiam id aliquam magna.
We are here.	Hic sumus.
I wonder why not.	Miror cur non.
Time is great!	Tempus multa est!.
Everything is possible.	Omnia potest.
I don't believe it to be so.	Non credo ita esse.
But no no no.	Sed non nulla nulla.
No, but that was it.	Nulla sed erat quam.
I could not live without him.	Sine eo vivere non potui.
he wanted to do his job.	officium suum facere voluit.
But it is not so.	Sed non ita esse.
I didn't think through that.	Non putavi id per.
I need this post today.	Mihi opus est hoc post hodie.
I do not believe.	non credo.
He can no longer hear him.	Audire eum iam non potest.
We can't do it here.	Hic facere non possumus.
I am not quite sure.	Non sum satis certus.
But not in him.	Sed non in ipsum.
You look great.	Te magna vide.
Unless otherwise stated	Nisi aliud, .
You know, just do it.	Scis, modo facias.
No one knew anything.	Nemo aliquid scivit.
I would not do this.	hoc facere nolui.
Maybe but only time.	Aliquam sed tempus nisi.
Do this one thing.	Hoc unum facias.
There is no such thing as yourself.	Nulla ut ipsum est.
It was not bad at all.	Male omnino erat.
Maybe it's not a great thing.	Magna res fortasse non est.
But you have to go through it.	Sed habes ut per ipsum.
not too good.	Non nimium bonum.
And your	Et tua .
Great fun too.	Magna etiam amet.
You said what I was doing.	Dixisti quid facerem.
We do something and everything.	Nos aliquid et omnia.
Which indeed is quite easy.	Quod quidem satis facile est.
Something can be done.	Fieri aliquid potest.
Well, nothing like that.	Bene, nihil simile est.
Well with me.	Bene mecum.
But he wants to do it.	Sed id facere velit.
This is something we really need.	Hoc est aliquid nobis vere opus esse.
I told you in the afternoon.	Post meridiem tibi dixi.
Make time.	Fac tempus.
Well, that is.	Bene, id est.
Who is she? 	Quis est illa?
What is to be done.	Quid faciendum sit.
If you like, great.	Si placet, magna.
and his dog.	et canem suum.
No.	Non.
I have seen evil.	Vidi malum.
I want it first.	Primum volo.
This should not be done.	Hoc non debet.
I don't need to be like this.	Non debeo et sic non esse.
I knew.	Sciebam.
But there is a lot out there.	Sed sit amet enim ex.
You're at home now, boy.	Nunc domi es, puer.
There was always nothing to do with it.	Nulla id semper erat.
This thing does us all after all.	Haec res nos post omnes facit.
You just want to be yourself.	Vos iustus volo esse te ipsum.
i don't know anything about him.	nescio quid de eo.
one week	una septimana una.
I thought you were playing with me.	Cogitavi te ludere mecum.
I think we have time.	Ego habemus ad tempus habemus.
Don't buy it.	Non emit.
I have something to say to you.	Habeo tibi aliquid dicere.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
None of it did.	Nemo ex eo fecit.
Here's my question.	Hic mihi quaestio est.
I did what I did.	Ego quod feci.
From that time on she sought work.	Ex eo tempore illa opus quaesivit.
This is what you should never do.	Hoc est quod numquam facere debes.
you have time.	habes tempus.
It's not hard either.	Non est difficile, vel.
We're only three at the same time.	Nos per tantum simul tres sumus.
but he wished to speak of this.	sed de hoc loqui voluit.
And he was to her.	Erat autem ad eam.
I want to be here and now.	Hic et nunc esse volo.
No one can be better than you can.	Nemo potest melius esse quam potes.
i have to go through it.	habeo ire per eum.
It is definitely similar.	Certum simile est.
And he said to him.	Et dixit ei.
I hope that he does.	Spero quod agit.
No one but none.	Nulla quis nulla nisi.
i can still.	adhuc possum.
But now he was not alone.	Modo tamen non erat solus.
See, do.	Vide fac.
You can't do this.	Hoc facere non potes.
It is always late.	Sero semper.
It is not great.	Non magna.
It's time to take the time.	Aliquam ut tempus est.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
You can do the same here.	Idem hic facere potes.
.	.
That's what he wants us to do.	Id nos facere velit.
And you really don't have anything else to do.	Et vere aliud facere non habes.
Three in the room.	Tres ad cubiculum.
Maybe this time will be right.	Forsitan hoc tempus recte erit.
Thus we have.	Sic habemus.
To get things done, you need to deal with it.	Res ut sunt, opus est agere.
He was ready.	Erat paratus.
Make a trip plan again.	Iterum iter fac consilium.
But he doesn't always want to.	Sed non semper velit.
But perhaps there will be no time.	Sed fortasse tempus non erit.
You are not.	Non es.
What did you do today for your job?.	Quid fecisti hodie ad officium tuum ?.
what he meant.	Quid sibi vellet.
And it was time.	Erat autem tempus.
Which indeed is so.	Quod quidem ita est.
You need to do this if possible.	Hoc facere debes, si fieri potest.
If we can't.	Si non possumus.
Now nothing can be done with him here.	Modo cum eo nihil hic fieri possumus.
got everything.	Omnia obtinuit.
But he could not do it himself.	Sed id se facere non potuit.
Always a great statement.	Semper magna dictum.
I know what's wrong with you.	Scio quid mali tibi.
My dad bought it.	Pater meus eam emit.
I haven't got it.	Non obtinuit eam.
Doing what he wanted to do.	Faciens quod facere voluit.
You must not do this.	Hoc facere non debes.
It's a good school day.	Bonum est schola hodie est.
And yet he did not come.	Et tamen non venit.
And he did not know what he was doing.	Et nesciebat quid faceret.
It's still not enough.	Parum adhuc est.
She told me everything.	Omnia mihi indicavit.
Not long after that.	Non multo post id est.
i never thought much about it.	numquam multum de eo cogitavi.
Not much, perhaps, but some.	Non multum fortasse, sed aliquam.
You are not my father.	Non es pater.
He was not happy.	Felix non erat.
But for the purpose.	Sed ad rem.
This was going to happen.	Hoc futurum erat.
But there will be something.	Sed futurum est aliquid.
Which is not true at all.	Quod omnino non est verum.
The same thing with him.	Idem cum illo.
It's time and never is.	Aliquam et numquam est.
I do not know what this was said.	Nescio quid hoc dictum sit.
It will be easy to find.	Facile erit invenire.
You know what you can do.	Scis potes.
It is good to have a plan.	Bonum est habere consilium.
He ate breakfast in the morning.	Mane prandium comedit.
I want to do it myself.	Volo me facere.
And this was what was needed.	Et hoc erat quod opus erat.
It was so well done.	Ita bene factum est.
and there is something.	et est aliquid.
There is no one to do it.	Nemo est id facere.
Maybe he gave a little more time.	Forsitan paulo plus dedit temporis.
I can't talk to you.	Non possum dicere tibi.
We can help!	Adiuvare possumus!.
He got his money.	Pecuniam eius obtinuit.
I can't believe it again.	Non possum adhuc credere.
This is only between you and me.	Hoc modo inter me et te est.
We have a dog.	Canem habemus.
About you, about me.	De te, de me.
Nothing can be done.	Nihil fieri.
Maybe you are.	Forsitan sis.
He refused to speak.	Noluit loqui.
This he knew for sure that he was not alive.	Hoc certe sciebat se non vivere.
This he said, is not entirely evil.	Hoc dixit, non totum malum est.
Or not to him.	Vel non ad ipsum.
I want you to go.	Volo te ire.
I don't know how to do this.	Nescio quomodo hoc facias.
You said it to me.	Tu mihi dixisti.
Good to be with you.	Bene sit tibi.
already speak.	jam loqui.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Really well.	Vere bene.
So he has them all.	Sic omnes habet.
He comes to me soon.	Is mox ad me venit.
He did not know what he would do if he did.	Ne quid faceret, si faceret, nesciebat.
I knew it was going to be.	sciebam futurum esse.
But we are not that.	Sed non sumus id.
but nothing much was done.	sed nihil multum factum est.
To do this well, he himself said.	Hoc bene facere, ipse dixit.
I feel at home.	Domum sentio.
It's not much.	Non multum est.
I just want you.	Ego iustus volo te.
More than one person.	Plus quam unus homo.
He says that he is not him, but.	Dicit se non esse eum, sed.
What happened, he said.	Quid acciderit, dixit.
Say all things, nothing.	Omnia dicere, nihil.
You do not do this.	Hoc non facis.
You know what you need.	Scis quid tibi opus sit.
Yours, yours, yours.	Tua, tua, tua.
What did you do this morning for work?	Quid fecisti hoc opus ad mane?
Now that's very important.	Nunc id ipsum sit amet.
Are you sure about this?.	Certus esne de hoc ?.
it is certain to do.	certum est facere.
i love you so much.	ita te amo.
But not enough.	Sed non satis.
Do you want to buy it?	Visne id emere?
Evil vs good.	Malum nobis bonum.
Yes it is certain.	Ita certum est.
It was good for me.	Mihi bonum fuit.
Look what it is up to.	Vide quid sit ad.
He will not.	Non vult.
That which was made, was made.	Quod factum est, factum est.
He could not, he could not.	Non potuit, non potuit.
Evil is what is difficult.	Malum est quod difficile est.
We do the same.	Nos idem.
He does not know that we are.	Nescit nos esse.
He didn't want to do this.	Noluit hoc facere.
if you can get it.	si potes accipere.
He did not know.	Nesciebat.
But that is great.	Sed id magna est.
Too much for one person.	Nimis unus homo est.
Or don't do anything.	Vel ne aliquid.
I am not anymore.	Non sum amplius.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
For I knew he knew everything about me.	Sciebam enim omnia de me scire.
There is no morning man.	Mane homo non est.
It's not great right now.	Etiam non magna nunc.
I myself.	ego ipse.
And we too.	Et nos quoque.
and nothing was done.	et nihil factum est.
No one knows what tomorrow will always be.	Nemo scit quid cras futurum sit semper.
Yes! 	Ita!
That was not true.	Quod non erat verum.
But I wanted to be with you.	Verum volui ut tecum.
I can't leave here yet.	Hic tamen relinquere non possum.
That's what you have.	Id habes.
I heard good.	Audivi bonum.
It is still good.	Tamen bonum est.
I am still there.	adhuc sum ibi.
I want to know why.	Scire volo cur.
Hard to say, and never good.	Dicere difficile est, et nunquam bonum.
i have to say.	habeo dicere.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
Maybe who it was now.	Aliquam quis nunc erat.
No it is none.	Nulla id nulla est.
But that's not the thing.	Id autem rem non.
Nothing in him but	Nulla in ipsum nisi.
Just say your name.	Modo dic nomen tuum.
like you probably do.	sicut tu probabiliter facis.
This was to do with her.	Hoc erat facere de suo.
We can't have it.	Id habere non possumus.
Rightly indeed.	Recte quidem.
you want someone you like.	vis aliquem libet.
The time has come to see her.	Venit in tempore videre eam.
No one else yet.	Nemo tamen.
Which of course never stops.	Quae quidem numquam.
but he knew.	sed scivit.
what can he see in him?	quid in eo potest videre?
I saw him.	Vidi eum.
I have nothing wrong to say about this.	De hoc nihil mali habeo dicere.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
He didn't even understand it.	Ne id quidem intellexit.
I never had time like this.	Numquam sic tempus habui.
I have to do that.	Habeo facere.
He said well.	Dixit bene.
The latest statement is great.	Aliquam dictum magna est.
Nothing more.	Nihil amplius.
And certainly you have.	Et certe habes.
When this was done.	Quod cum factum esset.
The man said he was going to work.	Homo dixit se ad opus ire.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
But perhaps that is good.	Sed fortasse id bonum est.
I want to know what it is.	Volo quid sit.
I want to hear.	Audire volo.
You like it.	Tibi placet.
Which is bad.	Quod malum est.
How does this work? 	Quomodo hoc opus facit?
The best way to do this is in the spring.	Optime hoc facere est in vere.
You are my dog ​​now.	Canem meum nunc es.
That's right, everything.	SIC, ad omnia.
Getting up to me too.	Questus est ad me quoque.
I think she's doing too much.	Nimium puto illa facere.
This was before.	Hic fuit ante.
I'll tell you what we are.	Dicam quid sumus.
I could not see who it was, but someone was there.	Non potui videre quis esset, sed aliquis ibi erat.
He was also from whom.	Etiam a erat quam.
You and he are not, but only now.	Tu et ille non est, sed modo.
But he did not know what it was.	Sed quid esset, nesciebat.
See if you will do this, do well.	Vide, si hoc facturus es, bene fac.
It was also great.	Etiam in magna erat.
I don't mean to be.	Non vult esse.
It's just that we're busy.	Tantum est ut nimium occupatus sumus.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
and he still does.	et adhuc facit.
So to him.	Sic ei.
This doesn't mean anything wrong with you.	Hoc non vult aliquid mali apud te.
I feel it.	Sentio.
It is.	Sic est.
We have a good time.	Bonum tempus habemus.
He is what he is.	Ipse est quod est.
I don't believe you do anything else.	Non credo aliud facere.
I don't know how hard it is to speak.	Nescio quomodo difficile est ei loqui.
This is about my work so much.	Hoc est fere opus meum tantum.
We who we are.	Nos qui sumus.
He did not do this.	Hoc non fecit.
He realized he was doing the job.	Intellexit se officium facere.
How was the journey?	Quomodo iter fuit?
I never met.	Numquam occurrit.
But that was now.	Sed id nunc erat.
Yes, that's good.	Ita, id bonum.
It was really good.	Vere erat bonum.
It is not good.	Non est bona.
Me, but you know, not really.	Mihi, sed scis, non vere.
I don't know who did it.	Nescio quis fecerit.
He loves to swim.	Natare amat.
There is something about that and that.	Sit aliquid ut et.
Plenty of breakfast options.	Multa prandium bene.
You know that this was done.	Scis hoc factum esse.
Now I see something to do.	Nunc video aliquid facere.
But something else.	Sed aliud.
I don't believe they believe they do something wrong.	Non credo credere se aliquid mali facere.
It's my thing.	Mihi res est.
This pleases you.	Hoc tibi placet.
There was no need to be sure.	Nihil opus erat, si certus esset.
But I can't play video.	Sed video non ludere.
He did so.	Ita fecit.
Everything about him really.	Omnia de eo vere.
But it is yours.	Sed tuum est.
Which is most likely.	Quod verisimile est.
I know what's the problem.	Scio quid sit quaestio.
I don't think it would be.	Non puto fore.
I can't do it anymore.	Non possum amplius facere.
None from him before.	Nulla a ipsum ante.
She didn't want to be late.	Illa sero nolebat esse.
Finally he does.	Tandem facit.
The best thing is.	Res optime.
You want	Vis
People are very sad	Homines sunt nimis
Now go for this.	Nunc pro hac.
I didn't really talk for long.	Non diu vere loqui.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
There was none at all.	Nulla a aliquam erat.
And what else.	Et quod aliud.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
He knows everything.	Scit omnia.
It was an easy decision.	Facile consilium fuit.
It will be fine.	Bene erit.
I used to see him here.	Hic ego illum videre solebat.
No one said how important it is.	Nulla sit amet dictum quam.
Both are good.	Utrumque bonum est.
It's time for some.	Aliquam tempus est.
Hardly anyone wants.	Vix quis velit.
I ought to see, but you can't.	Videre debeo, sed tu non potes.
I can say nothing to him.	ei nihil possum dicere.
Why this was the question.	Quare hic esset quaestio.
It is still that way.	Adhuc illuc.
It is not necessary anymore.	Nec iam necesse est.
He knew when he had good.	Sciebat, quando bonum habuit.
You should be late to class.	Sero debes esse ad genus.
Not all of them both.	Non omnes utrumque.
It won't be easy.	Non erit facile.
It's your problem, not mine.	Quaestio tua est, non mea.
Certainly not.	Certe non.
This is great.	Hic, magna.
I think this is a good time.	Puto hoc tempus bonum esse.
Well, maybe not all.	Bene, fortasse non omnes.
It was just barely.	Vix modo erat.
I hope I stop by you often.	Spero me saepe a te prohibere.
Got it for three years.	Tres annos obtinuit pro eo.
But it is not difficult.	Sed non difficile est.
They do it for fun.	Et facere ut amet.
Happy to see you.	Felix videre.
I need more money.	Plus pecuniae mihi opus est.
So it is.	Ita est.
No one seemed sure.	Nemo certus videbatur.
To go home.	Domum ire.
I had to make lunch.	Habui prandium facere.
I did not know this.	Ego hoc nesciebam.
But it is.	Sed est enim.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
You can see it here , here and here .	Hic, hic et hic potes videre.
He now has the same thing.	Idem nunc habet.
There is also one for you.	Est etiam tibi unus.
Well and name.	Bene et nomen.
Totally something, really.	Prorsus aliquid, vere.
If so first.	SI Primum.
That certainly did happen today.	Id hodie fieri certe fecit.
Or perhaps somebody.	Vel fortasse quis.
Not to you, but to you.	Non tibi, sed tibi.
Well, they are not.	Bene, non sunt.
I said again.	iterum dixi.
Both, as it seems.	Ambo, ut videtur.
He could live here.	Hic vivere potuit.
It's what he can do.	Eius quam possit.
But this does not do evil.	Sed id non facit malum.
i can see in you.	videre possum in te.
No one really knows.	Nemo vere scit.
I have not done it before.	Non ante feci.
We can all go and act like this.	Possumus omnes ire et sic agere.
I just play something.	Modo aliquid ludere.
Child when possible.	Puer, cum potest.
He could say nothing.	Nihil dicere potuit.
So what he says is true.	Ita verum est quod dicit.
Talk to someone.	Loqui cum aliquo.
I don't want to say exactly that.	Nolo prorsus id dicere.
But this still means a lot to me.	Sed haec tamen multum est ad me.
And there it was true.	Et ibi verum fuit.
But you never know.	Sed numquam scis.
It's almost like nothing else.	Aliud fere simile est.
It was hard to hear.	Vix erat audire.
This is not one.	Hoc non est unum.
i want to live longer.	diutius vivere volo.
I really don't have.	Ego vere non habeo.
This ought not to be so.	Hoc sic esse non debet.
But he is with him.	Sed est cum illo.
But not the same thing.	Sed non id ipsum.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
To be honest for you.	Ut sit amet enim.
This is what it looks like.	Hoc est quod videtur.
He ought also to know.	Scire etiam debet.
Buy it if you don't like it.	Si emere non placet.
Yes, this time.	Etiam id tempus.
He wasn't sure what he did.	Non certum erat quis fecerit.
i've never seen it before.	numquam ante vidi.
I hope that you can see.	Spero quod potes videre.
There is only a.	Est nisi a.
There's no time for him.	Nulla nec tempus ipsum.
Tell me what's happened.	Quid acciderit dic.
Good to know.	Bonum scire.
You can stay at home too!	Etiam domi manere potes!
I really love you a lot.	Ego vere multum amo.
Surely he could not.	Vere non potuit.
He didn't want to talk to him.	Noluit loqui ei.
But it was not that.	Sed non erat id.
She didn't know what she thought.	Nesciebat quid putavit.
and this to the said.	et hoc ad dictum.
That's never been done before.	Ut id numquam ante.
But perhaps that's	Sed fortasse id.
Now I'll tell you.	Nunc tibi dicam.
It certainly wasn't long.	Certe non diu fuit.
I like it more, more.	Plus placet, plus.
I would like to do it too.	Vellem id quoque.
it was to be.	erat esse.
But they're not.	Sed non sunt es.
That is for us.	Quod nobis est.
Tell me one thing, do it.	Dic mihi unum, fac.
He was not sure.	Non erat certus.
But not about this.	Sed non de hoc.
Nor does he say that he is alone.	Nec dicit solum esse.
For I never like it so well.	Numquam enim tam bene placet.
It is still a question.	Adhuc quaestio est.
I could not understand why not.	Non potui intelligere cur non.
I know this.	id scio.
He has to act at the same time.	Simul agere habet.
I wanted to do something that I didn't do.	Aliquid facere volui quod non facerem.
That's another time.	Id aliud tempus est.
It can't have been easy.	Facile fuisse non potest.
not how you got it.	Non quomodo obtinuit.
I have never done this before.	Numquam ante id.
The same thing indeed.	Idem vere.
He was in me himself.	In me ipsum erat.
Everything is great.	Omnia magna.
I really don't like it.	Hoc vere non placet.
It's for something.	Est enim aliquid.
I could never find him again.	numquam eum iterum invenire potui.
I want to hear from you.	Audire te volo.
Good morning.	Bonum mane.
It is not possible!	Fieri non potest!
They are pretty good.	Satis multa sunt bona.
To be honest than none.	Ut sit amet quam nulla.
and he ought to know.	et scire debet.
But that's only him.	Sed id nisi ipsum.
It was probably his.	Verisimiliter eius fuit.
He had.	Habuit ille.
All in all, absolutely, absolutely.	Omnino, Omnino, Omnino.
It is very bad.	Valde malum est.
What you said was something.	Quod dixisti, aliquid fuit.
You do too much of this.	Nimium ex hoc facis.
He ought to do better.	Melius facere debet.
But when it was, nothing could hinder it.	Sed cum esset, nihil posset prohibere.
All in all I want.	Omnino volo.
This was not the first time it was done.	Non primum hoc factum est.
he said that I did not know.	is dixit me nescire.
This one is like it has.	Hoc unum est sicut habet.
I knew I wanted time with him.	Sciebam te tempus cum eo velle.
Maybe not ever.	Fortasse non umquam.
Yes they are.	Ita sunt.
That's not the same thing.	Ut nec est ipsum.
This has to stop.	Hoc habet prohibere.
Even still.	Adhuc quidem.
That's what's important.	Id quod amet est.
But he does not do it.	Sed id non facit.
I've never been there before.	Nunquam ibi ante fui.
I will do the same for you.	Idem ego faciam tibi.
Anything else you like.	Aliud tibi placet.
There is nothing else to say.	Non est aliud dicere.
No one is sure what will happen.	Nemo certus est quid futurum sit.
Now I don't know how.	Nunc non quam.
It is a great deal.	Multum est.
What can I say.	Quid dicere non possum.
You also don't need to know everything.	Tu quoque non omnia scire debes.
It was definitely owned by him.	Certum erat a se amet.
He was a boy.	Puer erat.
I don't want to know anything.	Nolo aliquid scire.
that is what you want too.	id est Quod etiam vis.
You are now.	Tu modo.
If you know well.	Si bene scis.
You don't need to be here.	Hic esse non debes.
Maybe even scared.	Fortasse vel vix.
I said to him: I like him.	Dixi ei: Ego similis ei.
what do i do.	Quid enim faciam.
I know this.	Hoc scio.
To this.	Ad haec.
Now that's some for you.	Nunc id aliquam enim.
It looks too easy.	Nimis facile videtur.
He had them at home.	Habuit domi.
Today I only have one.	Hodie tantum unum habet.
You can see him.	Videre eum potes.
It didn't take long.	Noluit diu.
It wasn't looking good.	Is vultus bonus non fuit.
But he wishes to have both.	Vult tamen utrumque habere.
I didn't think it was very good.	Ego non putavi valde bonum esse.
I will not tell you.	Non dicam tibi.
I don't have a lot of time.	Non multum temporis habeo.
I know many things.	Scio multa esse.
It is not about me, it is about him.	Non est de me, est de eo.
This is really bad.	Hoc est vere malum.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
No it's not great.	Nulla non magna ipsum.
You do all the work.	Totum opus facis.
He should not.	Non debet.
Say it again, please.	Dic iterum, quaeso.
People love me.	Homines ad me amat.
There's always something before.	Nulla aliquam semper ante.
This work is to be done tomorrow.	Id opus cras faciendum est.
This should not be done.	Hoc fieri non debet.
I tried hard to do my job.	Conatus sum difficile facere officium meum.
But there is always none at all.	Sed vel semper nulla.
But you don't look too much today.	Sed tu non vide nimis hodie.
Yes, perhaps the same thing.	Etiam fortasse ipsum.
Maybe you've never been there.	Fortasse numquam fuit ibi.
That's very happy for you.	Ut sit amet enim ipsum.
Now it was.	Nunc erat.
It was not that kind.	Non erat id genus.
What do we have here?	Quid hic habemus?
It would seem that it is not.	Videtur quod non.
It is not difficult to see why this is so.	Hoc cur ita sit, non difficile est videre.
We can't do it.	Non possumus facere.
He thought that a lot.	Quod multum putabat.
You need to know this.	Hoc ipsum scire debes.
But who was before him.	Sed quis ipsum ante.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
But not that night.	Sed non illa nocte.
She is one of you.	Unus est ex vobis.
There is one thing about the future.	Est unum fere futurum.
I would do so.	Facerem.
Gone, you can't help it anymore.	Abiit, amplius eum adiuvare non potes.
He did not do well.	Non fecit bene.
Tell me this is not true.	Dic mihi hoc non est verum.
both i.	utrumque ego.
This should go quickly this season.	Hoc cito hoc tempore debet ire.
That's got to be hard.	Quod 'difficile esse obtinuit.
They're gonna be here for fun!	Sunt amet hic amet!
Look just for you.	Vide modo tibi.
As or now.	Ut vel nunc.
But it is not so, it is not so.	Sed non sic est, non est ita.
It is not so for me.	Non ita est mihi.
I want this to happen.	Hoc volo fieri.
But this is for us.	Sed hoc est nobis.
So it is.	Ita est.
Which could not be done.	Qui fieri potuit.
He was always the same.	Etiam semper ipsum erat.
Or not the same.	Vel non ipsum.
No but no great things.	Nulla sed magna nulla.
Who wants to find him?	Invenire velit quis eum.
If you're into it.	Tu si in illud.
I'll tell him what he wants.	Quid sibi velit dicam.
Do you have time?	Habesne tempus?
to swim through.	Natare per.
don't play.	non ludere.
it was not too much.	non erat nimium.
Nothing new to discuss this morning.	Nihil novi ut de hoc mane.
I can't buy this.	Hoc emere non possum.
Not late for sure.	Non nuper certe.
All things are in us.	Omnia in nobis sunt.
I said.	Dixi.
He willed.	Voluit.
no one knows how much	quam multa nemo scit.
Not yet.	Non adhuc.
That's fine.	Bene hoc.
I've never been married.	Ego numquam uxorem.
I can't do it.	id facere non possum.
He was her husband.	Erat vir suus.
You have him there.	Ibi eum habes.
Don't say anything.	Noli dicere.
Now not only yourself.	Nunc non ipsum nisi.
He saw her.	Vidit eam.
That's the time it was.	Ut id tempus erat.
It was his	Eius erat .
I have everything here.	Omnia hic habeo.
I have a lot to say to you.	Multum habeo tibi dicere.
Or it was his.	Vel erat eius.
We have yet to travel.	Nos adhuc iter habemus.
And the time itself is not none at all.	Et tempus ipsum nec nulla.
This man could not do what was needed.	Hic facere non potuit quod opus erat.
and if you want to be.	et si vis esse.
I don't like anything.	Non placet mihi aliquid.
For this is what was made.	Hoc est enim, quod factum est.
None of this except for some.	Nulla id aliquam nisi.
He is a guy in a car.	Is currus guy per et per.
I love her there.	eam ibi amo.
But I wish if I could.	Sed utinam si posset.
Which, now, was.	Quod, modo, fuit.
Look at him.	Vide in eo.
They are yours.	Tua sunt.
And we are not.	Et non sumus.
You are ready.	Paratus es.
But he did not do nothing.	Sed nihil non fecit.
That's what you need to know.	Id quod scire debes.
But never, ever was.	Sed nunquam, semper fuit.
We can do only those things.	Quae nos solum facere possumus.
My dad seemed very busy.	Pater nimis occupatus mihi videbatur.
Maybe it's nothing.	Fortasse nihil est.
It's time to do it yourself.	Aliquam id ipsum.
Finally I had some of it to work.	Tandem habui aliquid ex eo ad opus.
No no no.	Nulla non nulla.
Again he did nothing.	Iterum nihil fecit.
I need to get home.	Mihi opus est domum.
But you don't have it if you don't want it.	Sed non habes si non vis.
And probably not doing well.	Et verisimile non est bene facere.
He could not understand this.	Hoc intelligere non potuit.
But for now.	Sed in nunc enim.
I know that he is one.	Scio eum unum esse.
Yes that's how great.	Etiam id quam magna.
So now that is.	Ita nunc id est.
Let him go.	Eat.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
I think it is something else.	aliquid aliud esse puto.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
It could have been much better than that.	Non potuit multo melius quam illa.
With reference to.	Cum ad.
This was going to be easy.	Hoc erat facile futurum.
I hope too.	Spero etiam.
I know it's difficult.	Scio difficile.
Good people too.	Bene nimium homines.
I don't like the job.	Non ut officium.
Was.	Erat.
This is the man.	Hic est homo.
No one can do it.	Nemo potest facere.
It is easy to see why this happened.	Cur hoc acciderit, facile est videre.
This he did nothing.	Hoc nihil fecit.
But today is different.	Sed hodie aliud est.
I don't even want it.	Ne id quidem volo.
Okay, so	Bene, sic.
i never saw.	numquam vidi.
He said something different about time, however.	Aliud dixit de tempore, sed.
Yes, it was not.	Etiam non erat.
You said to us.	Dixisti nobis.
It looked good.	Videbatur illud bonum.
But we need to know.	Sed scire opus est.
Yes that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum.
But that's not how.	Sed id non quam.
Good thing here.	Bona res hic.
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
It seems very nice.	Admodum videtur.
This is my bedroom.	Cubiculum meum est.
She just didn't want a job.	Illa iustus officium noluit.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
This is totally true.	Prorsus hoc verum est.
But there was no one.	Sed quis nulla erat.
I am alone here.	Ego solus hic sum.
And me.	Et me.
He has not seen this before.	Hoc ante non vidit.
I have one question.	Habeo unum quaestionem.
But not enough.	Sed non satis.
but much better.	sed multo melius.
I can't hear you do it.	Non possum audire me facere.
He is not here today.	Hic hodie non est.
I have seen nothing yet.	Nihil adhuc vidi.
Maybe he'll be right.	Forsitan recte erit.
I don't know whether it is so.	Nescio an ita sit.
What I can't do.	Quod facere non possum.
However, something had to be done;	Tamen aliquid faciendum erat;
That he was not.	Ut non erat.
Now there is no one who loves you at all.	Nunc sit nemo omnino te amat.
Nothing has been done.	Nihil factum est.
We truly are.	Nos vere sumus.
I'm going to it again.	Ego ad eam iterum.
I'm behind my work.	Ego post me opus meum.
it seemed too much.	nimium videbatur.
There was some order here.	Ut hic aliquam erat.
We've certainly got something for it.	Nos certe aliquid pro eo obtinuit.
But he doesn't want to be alone.	Sed non solum velit.
And they are not good.	Et non sunt bona.
Well, no.	Bene, non est.
I am after you.	Ego post te sum.
No one is at home except me.	Nemo domi nisi me.
Yes indeed he did.	Ita vere fecit.
The first is man.	Primum est homo.
Police had not said.	Aliquam nec dictum erat.
Let's start with the statement.	Sit amet dictum.
It's not as hard as it looks.	Non tam difficile est quam spectat.
I forgot the name.	Nomen oblitus sum.
I can't anymore.	Non possum amplius.
It is good.	Bene est.
It is good.	Bene est.
I want her to see me.	Volo eam videre me.
You've never been sore.	Tu numquam valde.
It is a great thing.	Res magna est.
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
That's all.	Id est omnia.
Not even here.	Non id quidem hic.
Even in the desire to do nothing.	Etiam in velit nulla.
That was something else.	Aliud erat id.
But you have better.	Sed melius habes.
I always .	Ego semper .
That's what I am.	Id quod mihi.
It's time and great.	Aliquam et magna est.
Right from me.	Recte a me.
He told me that he loves me.	Is mihi dixit quod me amat.
Or as it is.	Vel ut est.
You really need to win at home.	Vere domi vincere opus est.
In this way he does.	Hoc modo facit.
You can't do this anymore.	Hoc amplius facere non potes.
he thought.	putavit.
But it seems better.	Sed melius videtur.
You have this.	Hoc habes.
I know we're not doing it.	Scio nos non id facere.
I don't think this is true.	Non puto hoc verum esse.
And so so	Et sic sic.
and they are.	et sunt.
It's time to do nothing.	Aliquam id facere nulla.
Your work.	Tuum opus.
So it is.	Ita est.
It is still good to do.	Tamen facere bonum est.
Maybe you don't like it.	Fortasse non placet.
I can't speak very well.	Non possum me optime dicere.
I can't say enough.	Non possum satis dicere.
But that's exactly what happened recently.	Sed id ipsum quod nuper factum est.
It shouldn't take long.	Non debet tam diu.
This is only true.	Hoc solum verum est.
Both did not work.	Utrumque opus non fecit.
You don't have to say.	Dicere non habes.
I have everything.	Habeo omnia.
I know .	Scio .
that he could never do it.	numquam id posse id.
That's what the plan says.	Id quod dicit consilium.
He just couldn't.	Iustus non potuit.
All good things only.	Omnia bona tantum.
This is not enough, but it does well.	Hoc non satis est, sed bene facit.
But it is time.	Sed tempus est.
And before lunch.	Et ante prandium.
He seems to know in this way, but it is not true.	Scire videtur hoc modo, sed non est verum.
No one knew about you.	Nemo de te scivit.
But it cannot be done rightly.	Sed recte fieri non potest.
And we too.	Et nos quoque.
That's probably something to do with it.	Id probabiliter aliquid ad rem.
I don't go with anyone.	Non ire cum aliquo.
I tried this.	Conatus sum hoc.
Yes, it was not before.	Etiam non erat ante.
And you need to be too.	Et nimium esse debes.
I feel you.	Sentio tibi.
And it is not good.	Et non est bonum.
he said that he could not understand me.	dixit se non posse me intelligere.
But it was the same thing.	Sed erat id ipsum.
I know too many things.	Scio etiam multa.
I never thought we could even become friends.	Numquam putavi nos etiam amicos fieri.
I don't want to be single.	Nolo unum esse.
But today is the day.	Sed hodie est dies.
never was, never will be.	numquam fuit, numquam erit.
and he came.	et venit.
Not all exactly.	Non omnes prorsus.
I don't know why it is so.	Nescio cur ita sit.
There is nothing more.	Nihil amplius est.
That is where we are today.	Id est ubi hodie sumus.
However, he cannot believe this.	Tamen hoc non potest credere.
And without him.	Et sine eo.
I don't want this to be different.	Nolo hoc aliud esse.
He knows too well.	Scit nimium bene.
I don't know why.	Nescio cur.
Went to lunch.	Ad prandium abiit.
You are a man.	Tu es homo.
I could not think.	Cogitare non potui.
Even who it was.	Etiam quis erat.
I can't think of anything.	Quod cogitare non possum.
Pretty much for this week.	Satis multa pro hac septimana.
as it seemed.	ut videbatur.
I'm still working on that.	Im 'etiam opus in illo.
Maybe who it was.	Aliquam quis erat erat.
Do not come.	Noli venire.
I love you and see you.	Te amo et de te videre.
We cannot wait.	Manere non possumus.
It is important that	Aliquam sit amet quam.
I don't want to see him again.	Nolo eum iterum videre.
I'm sorry for you.	Paenitet me tibi.
You know for sure.	Pro certo scis.
Do whatever you like.	Fac quod tibi placet fac.
I don't want to talk.	Nolo loqui.
He was ready.	Erat paratus.
It was to be something.	Esse aliquid erat.
watches.	spectat.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
Without me you are nothing.	Sine me nihil es.
I thought you wanted to know.	Putabam te scire velle.
The room was full.	Cubiculum erat.
I have seen it before.	Vidi ante.
it doesn't make you feel.	ut sentio non facit.
How about him.	Quomodo de illo.
You'd like to come before you.	Velis ante te venire.
I need it.	Mihi opus est.
It's better for you to do.	Melius est tibi facere.
I don't want to hear.	Nolo audire.
I just went here.	Modo huc abiit.
I can't really talk right now.	Non possum vere loqui nunc.
I knew he wasn't giving up.	Sciebam se non dare.
But that's how it was.	Sed id quam erat.
I don't want to hear.	Nolo audire.
Boy, you're good at that.	Puer, bonus es eo.
People are busy.	Homines occupatus sunt.
And he said to him.	Et dixit ei.
Take a look at what you want.	Vide tamen vis.
Nothing is here for you.	Nihil hic tibi est.
The question is for you.	Quaestio est tibi.
No one was too happy.	Nemo nimium felix fui.
But today there was none.	Sed hodie nulla erat.
But that's not always.	Sed id non semper.
but you have to go through it.	sed habes ut per illum.
We never met.	Numquam nobis occurrit.
that I knew.	esse sciebam.
See you soon!	Vide te mox!.
I need a room.	Cubiculum mihi opus est.
That's a plan.	Id consilium habere.
He says something.	Dicit aliquid.
If not what he did.	Nisi quod fecit.
No one really knows.	Nemo vere scit.
i love you more than you.	amo te quam tu.
Yes it is, no one really knows.	Ita est, nemo vere scit.
But he has something for me.	Sed habet aliquid meum.
Please be here.	Sis hic.
What happened to you.	Quod factum est tibi.
Well one did.	Bene unus fecit.
We can do exactly this.	Prorsus hoc facere possumus.
I want to do something, be somebody.	Aliquid facere volo, aliquem esse.
But neither has it been said now.	Sed nec dictum nunc.
Where did he come from?	Ubi venit?
That's the thing to do.	Id ipsum facere.
I had mine.	Habui meum.
I don't even have anything else to say.	Ne quidem habeo aliud dicere.
It is true.	Verum est.
Something in the next room.	Aliquid in proximo sunt cubiculum.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
I am very glad to be here.	Valde gaudeo hic esse.
I know this is not going to happen.	Scio hoc non futurum esse.
And we're here to help.	Et hic sumus ad auxilium.
It has been like this for more than a year.	Sicut hoc amplius anno fuit.
For now	Nunc enim.
But that was before.	Sed id erat ante.
not you anymore.	Non te amplius.
To do this my love.	Facere id mea.
It should be done.	Fieri debet.
I don't know who.	Nescio quis.
But that's not the same thing here.	Sed id ipsum non hic.
Not us.	Non nobis.
There is no one other than that.	Nulla quis quam.
But as it is before.	Sed ut est ante.
What is? 	Quid est?
what i can say.	quod possum dicere.
but he has.	sed habet.
Today is gone.	Hodie abiit.
Take some time for yourself.	Aliquam id tempus ipsum.
And he said to himself.	Dixit et se.
He must go.	Ire se debet.
My husband is not here.	Vir meus hic non est.
Well not anymore.	Bene non amplius.
He already saw the truth.	Iam verum vidit.
No he is not himself.	Nulla non est quis ipsum.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
He wanted me to look better, but better.	Voluit mihi videri, sed melius.
It looks good to me.	Bonum mihi videtur.
But no one knew what to do.	Sed quid hoc facere nemo scivit.
He would not.	Noluit.
I hope at least I will do it again.	Spero certe iterum me facturum.
the father said.	pater dixit.
If he does, he doesn't need us.	Si facit, non opus est nobis.
It is good for you to come before you.	Bonum est tibi futurum ante te.
And you can do what you need.	Quod quidem facere potes et debes.
I have a lot of time with her.	Habeo multum tempus eius.
So, .	Sic, .
There's something.	Ibi aliquid est.
May it be so.	Sit ut et.
I am sure he will do that.	Certus sum facturum esse.
And who's great.	Et quis magna.
I know you need to go.	Scio te ire necesse est.
He was also from himself.	Etiam a erat ipsum.
You'd better come too.	Melius etiam tibi venire velis.
I would not.	Nolui.
Nothing will happen from it.	Nihil ex illa futurum est.
Well done.	Bene factum est.
I don't need to do that.	Non opus est facere.
But to do well.	Sed bene facere.
As it was.	Ut erat.
Was.	Esset.
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
He didn't want to say it either.	Dicere noluisse vel id.
He never wants.	Numquam velit.
Yes indeed.	Ita quidem.
Not even this.	Ne hoc quidem.
You said so to me.	Tu mihi sic dixisti.
We do better than that.	Melius nobis facere quam id.
More, more, he said.	Plus, plus, dixit.
Both are true.	Utrumque verum est.
At last! 	Tandem!
Finally, the time has come for the matter.	Tandem, venit tempus ad rem.
It's better not to think of someone.	Melius est non cogitare de aliquo.
Maybe it is so.	Fortasse ita est.
Maybe that was always the case.	Aliquam id semper erat.
Looks like you've got real good.	Vultus amo te verum bonum obtinuit.
Certainly not my father.	Certe non pater.
He knew his way.	Sciebat iter suum.
But you can do it on him.	Sed de illo potes.
What a boy he was.	Quid puer ille fuit.
You're this?	Hoc sis?.
Even better than none.	Etiam melius nulla esse.
Now, when he was already.	Jam, cum jam esset.
You can be something more.	Plus aliquid esse potes.
No man can say this.	Hoc nemo homo potest dicere.
I don't know you.	Non novi te.
We can never know.	Numquam scire possumus.
For one thing, work was his job.	Unum, opus, quod eius fuit officium.
I think she was at home.	Puto eam domi fuisse.
It is good.	Bene est.
But not a problem.	Sed non quaestio.
Do it this time.	Fac hoc tempore.
He said to me, 'You can do this.'	Dixit mihi, potes hoc facere.
but to us.	sed ad nos.
It was the same thing.	Idem erat.
That's a great idea.	Ut id enim magna.
No one is where you want to be.	Nemo est ubi vis.
Do it yourself again.	Fac ut te ipsum iterum.
So at least do it.	Ita certe facere.
Now we're here.	Nunc hic sumus.
It seems to be a problem.	Videtur esse quaestio.
I don't like.	Non ut.
sorry to say so late.	Paenitet tam sero dicere.
But not .	Sed non .
It would be good to see you again.	Esset bonum te videre iterum.
And now this.	Et nunc hoc.
That's your plan.	Id tuum consilium est.
i know it's possible.	scio posse.
But you can do it.	Sed facere potes.
I knew it would be so.	Sciebam fore ita.
I don't want to leave you.	Nolo ego te relinquere.
It was his car too.	Etiam currus eius erat.
I just stay this way.	Modo manere hoc modo.
So perhaps better.	Melius fortasse sic.
you need to do one thing.	unum facere debes.
Nothing pleases me enough.	Nihil satis placet.
We who we are.	Nos qui sumus.
I don't know you.	Nescio vos.
If it were good.	Si bona esset.
But he said nothing about him.	Sed nihil de eo dixit.
That's just us now.	Quod tantum modo nobis.
But the work does not appear.	Sed opus non videtur.
I've decided to give the truth a go.	Certum est mihi dare verum ire.
We all left.	Omnes nos reliquit.
Something is going wrong.	Aliquid eat malum.
It's probably not good.	Probabiliter non est bonum.
But that's much better.	Sed id multo melius.
who not?	quis non?.
i want to be someone.	esse aliquem volo.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
This is also possible.	Quod etiam fieri potest.
I don't know much.	Non multum scio.
You can do whatever you want with it.	Facere potes quod vis cum illa.
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
You don't like me.	Non sicut me.
I don't know what's better.	Non novi quid melius.
I've never been home.	Numquam domum.
I can't stop it.	Non possum eam prohibere.
He does his business in his own time.	Suam rem facit suo tempore.
And you need to know this.	Et hoc scire debes.
But this has not been done quite well.	Sed id non admodum factum est.
He has a house.	Habet domum.
I have this.	Hoc habeo.
He is the one who says that he is.	Ipse est qui dicit se esse.
He left for me to find.	Reliquit enim me invenire.
Say how much, time and day.	Dic quantum, tempus et dies.
May the force be with you.	Sit vis tecum.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
I certainly feel this way.	Ego certe sic sentio.
We can't talk about anything.	Nihil possumus loqui.
I need someone to tell me it's okay.	Mihi opus esset aliquis dicere mihi bene esse.
I want him to know it's going to be okay.	Scire volo eum bene futurum.
There was no time.	Non tempus erat.
So perhaps.	Ita fortasse.
Is good.	Bonus est.
She really needs to go to school.	Illa vere ad scholam ire debet.
You have done so very well.	Sic optime fecisti.
Thirty was late.	Triginta sero fuit.
You can't believe it.	Credere non potes.
We have indeed.	Habemus quidem.
It is not good.	Non bonum.
Not at all.	Omnino non est.
Go home in the morning.	Mane domum.
yes or how.	Etiam vel quam.
I said your name.	dixi nomen tuum.
I think something is up.	Puto aliquid usque.
I was myself.	ipse eram.
That's pretty much it.	Id satis multa.
He didn't know what to do anymore.	Nesciebat quis id faceret amplius.
Time to come.	Tempus futurum.
He always has, always wills.	Semper habet, semper vult.
I don't know whether it is still there.	Nescio an adhuc ibi sit.
You just said that you could learn.	Tu modo dixisti te scire posse.
He does so with everyone.	Ita facit apud omnes.
But we cannot know with certainty.	Sed certo scire non possumus.
To do business.	Facere rem.
But almost exclusively.	Sed solum fere.
I did not say this.	Hoc non dixi.
I am getting used to everything.	Questus sum ad omnia.
After one day I had.	Post diem unum habui.
At least in this school.	In hac schola certe.
I don't have time yet.	Non tamen tempus ut.
But it did not seem probable.	Sed verisimile non videbatur.
You are working too hard.	Nimis difficile es opus.
He just didn't want to.	Iustus noluit.
But he could do nothing.	Sed nihil facere potuit.
I can see everything now.	Omnia nunc videre possum.
Where are they tonight.	Ubi hac nocte sunt.
Yes, it was not.	Etiam non erat.
I am not going home.	Non domum.
and so it is.	et ita est.
So? 	Sic?
I just want to be myself.	EGO iustus volo me esse.
He made him.	Fecit eum.
To me this seems too bad.	Mihi etiam id malum videtur.
I don't like this.	Hoc non placet.
If you want to talk about who you are.	Nisi vis loqui de te, qui sis.
Yet again.	Adhuc iterum.
It can still be done.	Potest tamen fieri.
What was his name?	Quod erat nomen eius?
That's going to happen.	Quod futurum est.
It is getting better.	Melius est questus.
I don't know what it is.	Nescio quid sit.
That's not enough today.	Quod non est hodie satis.
You said to us.	Dixisti nobis.
He knew that he didn't want to.	Sciebat se noluisse.
As in no.	Ut in nulla.
What is.	Quid est.
Well here.	Hic, bene.
He left.	Ille reliquit.
But now it's probably not enough.	Sed iam satis verisimile non est.
Don't do it better.	Id ne melius facias.
I know a lot of people think.	Scio multum videtur.
But this cannot be true.	Sed hoc verum esse non potest.
I could think of nothing else.	nihil aliud cogitare potui.
Nothing is like that.	Nihil est simile.
You can certainly do better than that.	Melius certe potes quam facere.
Not even that.	Ne id quidem.
there was much need to say.	quantum opus erat dicere.
That's great.	Id magna.
Both are with me.	Mecum est utrumque.
This time it's just me.	Hoc tempore suus iustus mihi.
If the decision was not made.	Si consilium non fuit.
But not as a man.	Sed non ut homo.
that was only.	id erat solum.
I feel like it looks at me.	Sentio ut me spectat.
He ought to know.	Scire debet.
What matters to us.	Quae res nobis.
He refused to speak.	Noluit loqui.
Well, not you.	Bene, non tu.
But not only.	Sed non nisi.
She could do something like this.	Posset hoc aliquid.
That's a bad thing.	Id malum est.
I think he is from.	Puto eum a.
I need to give him some advice.	Aliquid ei consilium dare debeo.
So it is.	Ita est.
None in any but	Nulla in aliquam nisi.
Or perhaps not.	Vel fortasse non.
THROUGH THE YEARS.	PER ANNOS.
He was not.	Non erat.
Do what you've done.	Facere quod fecisti.
I don't like to tell you.	Non amo tibi dicere.
But it was done.	Sed factum est.
I said something.	aliquid dixi.
He did not know.	Nesciebat.
I'll tell you why.	Dicam cur.
Yes that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
Please do this.	Placet hoc facere.
At least right now.	Nunc certe recte.
Can't say anything yet.	Non potest adhuc aliquid dicere.
which i know very well.	quod optime scio.
It could be him, or he was like that.	Posset eum vel erat ut, quod.
To-morrow was by him.	Cras a ipsum erat.
You know you're not here.	Scis te hic non esse.
He loves here.	Hic amat.
Nothing was said for you.	Nulla dictum enim.
I haven't heard anymore.	Non audivi amplius.
It was still hard.	Fuit tamen difficile.
You mean too much to me.	Nimium vis mihi.
But not as of now.	Sed non ut nunc.
It was a great story.	Aliquam magna erat.
This ought to be good.	Hoc bonum esse debet.
I wish I was good to you.	Utinam bonus essem vobis.
I know nothing.	Scio nihil esse.
But that never happened.	Quae numquam, sed.
We're not entirely sure what it does.	Quod facit, certe non sumus omnino.
The only way.	Solum modo.
I'm not used to anything lately.	Im 'non esse solebat ad aliquid nuper.
I just don't have enough time.	Tantum non habet tempus satis.
Most likely it will be for you.	Verisimile erit tibi.
It was almost time.	Nunc fere erat.
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
And it is not.	Et non est.
It can be the same for you.	Idem tibi potest esse.
the boy asked.	puer quaesivit.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
If something is going to happen now.	Si quid nunc futurum sit.
You can buy.	Emere potes.
He did not understand.	Non intellexit.
You just know what's going to happen.	Tu modo scis quid futurum sit.
I can hardly believe myself.	Vix me credere possum.
This is going to happen.	Hoc futurum est.
I still do.	adhuc facio.
This is not even today.	Hoc etiam hodie non est.
We don't have to do so.	Non habemus id.
He has a name.	Nomen habet.
He knows me too well.	Me nimium bene novit.
i've never seen it before.	numquam ante vidi.
But it is in him.	Sed in ipsum est.
And for a long time nothing was done.	Et diu nihil factum est.
i love your job.	officium tuum amo.
His work was never done.	Numquam eius opus factum est.
It is also likely that there was more work.	Verisimile est etiam quod plus opus erat.
There is.	Ibi est.
Or perhaps you don't want to.	Vel fortasse non vis.
He doesn't want to talk.	Is loqui non vult.
What was his name.	Quod erat nomen eius.
There is not much difference between the two.	Non multum inter utrumque est.
Tell me what you are doing.	Dic quid facias.
Now you can see me.	Nunc me videre potes.
You don't need to see it.	Non debes eam videre.
Nor do we.	Nec nos.
Which way it was done.	Quod ita factum est.
Not so much.	Non ita valde.
Maybe next year.	Fortasse anno.
There's still a lot of work to do.	Adhuc non multum opus est.
It's late or late now.	Nunc vel sero est.
That's gonna be great.	Ut sit amet magna.
He saw nothing.	Nihil vidit.
That's how to do it yourself.	Ut id quam ipsum.
You have done well!	Bene fecisti!.
He said to him all that he knew.	Dixit ei omnia quae sciebat.
He is not gone.	Non abiit.
I have a house.	Habeo domum.
Like what's wrong with me.	Simile quid mali me.
On this day	Hac die.
I didn't know what it was.	Nesciebam quid esset.
The matter is so.	Ita res est.
no one asked.	nemo quaesivit.
It's all yours.	Totum tuum est.
Well, got it.	Bene, obtinuit.
You don't need this yet.	Hoc tamen non debes.
He said nothing more, and there was no need.	Nihil amplius dixit, nec opus erat.
I doubt this.	Hoc dubito.
We've done very well.	Optime fecisti nos.
It was said indeed, just as when it was done.	Dictum est quidem, sicut et quando factum est.
You are who you are and this is it.	Tu es qui es et hoc illud est.
i hope	ut spero.
I just don't know who.	Ego iustus nescio quis.
That was his job.	Quod eius officium fuit.
as we have today.	sicut hodie habemus.
Looks like a question.	Similis quaestio.
All right.	Recte.
I wanted to say.	volui dicere.
There is nothing new.	Nihil novi est.
It's not hard to see why.	Non est difficile videre quare.
That was wrong.	Quod erat malum.
I thought you'd understand.	Putavi velis intelligere.
You don't owe too much.	Non debes nimis.
He could see why.	Posset cur.
None of the above said.	Nulla in dictum quam.
He ought to know.	Scire debet.
For I never saw him speak so much.	Numquam enim tantum eum loqui vidi.
I hope to see you in time.	Spero te videre in tempore.
I don't see it happening.	Non video id fieri.
It's something else.	Est aliquid aliud.
I know what you mean.	Scio quid velit.
This, not.	Hic, non.
I have my name.	nomen habeo.
I'm trying to find a way to do it.	Im 'conatur invenire quomodo id facere possit.
Well, not much.	Bene, non multum.
But it was not that.	Sed non erat id.
This was still early today.	Hoc erat usque hodie mane.
Probably by now, I just didn't want to see him.	Probabiliter iam, solum me videre noluit.
No one told me it would be so.	Nemo mihi dixit sic fore.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
Or not much at this time.	Vel non multum hoc tempore.
But enough to speak.	Sed satis loqui.
It was great to come back to everything.	Multum venire ad omnia.
Will get one as soon as possible.	Unus erit quam primum.
Evil is good.	Malum est bonum.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Nescio quid mali me.
There's a lot of time.	Non est multum tempus.
I don't want you to know.	Nolo te scire.
I'm glad that it's not in it.	Gaudeo quod in illa non est.
This is all.	Hoc totum est.
He could not discuss it.	Non potuit de illo.
I think this is true.	Hoc vere puto.
He was not.	Non erat.
No one seems to know much about him.	Nemo multum de se scire videtur.
This is not the whole.	Hoc non est totum.
It was a day for him.	Dies erat pro eo.
I didn't think.	Non putavi.
She didn't expect it.	Non illa putabat.
You can do everything.	Omnia potes.
It is also very important.	Etiam in ipsum magna.
Must be tonight.	Debet esse hac nocte.
This is not nationality.	Hoc non est genus.
I knew it.	Sciebam eam.
Men are good to themselves.	Homines bene sibi sunt.
He could be sent to him.	Posset ad eum.
I just don't think much.	Modo non multum puto.
I don't know when or how or why.	Nescio quando vel quomodo vel quare.
you're just looking busy.	Iustus vultus occupatus es.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
He always knew it.	Ita semper sciebat.
Traveling to reality.	Iter eius ad rem.
He does the same thing already.	Idem jam facit.
Well, at least it's the thing.	Bene, certe res est.
Who doesn't like him.	Quis non illum similis.
not me.	non me.
if done.	si factum est.
I can't take it anymore.	Non possum amplius accipere.
I did not say that.	Non dixi illud.
Don't have a car.	Non currus.
This is so certain today there is no more.	Hoc tam certum hodie non est amplius.
Who did it.	Qui fecit.
It's not bad.	Malum non est.
Too much, almost.	Multo etiam, fere.
I don't want that one.	Nolo illum unum.
But not soon enough.	Sed non cito satis.
And that is great.	Et id est magna.
That's the plan.	Id consilium.
I just don't have time for us.	Modo non tempus nobis.
It's time to get some more than that.	Aliquam in aliquam quam.
Maybe there was some.	Aliquam erat aliquam erat.
He has nothing to do with this.	Nihil ad hoc habet.
It could still be done.	Fieri tamen potuit.
He gave everything.	Omnia dedit.
And he was a good man for you.	Et vir bonus erat tibi.
And I wanted to do everything and everything.	Et volui facere omnia, et omnia.
I didn't really ask why.	Non vere quaesivit cur.
Yes, it is true.	Ita est, verum est.
I'm ready to do something.	Paratus sum ad aliquid faciendum.
This he did.	Hoc fecit.
If not, there's no point to which.	Nisi, nulla id ad quam.
We don't need it.	Non opus est nobis.
Nothing else to do.	Nihil aliud agere.
He also doesn't want him.	Etiam non ipsum velit.
I've never really seen anything quite like it.	Vere nunquam vidi quicquam satis simile.
But he is not here now, and you.	Sed hic nunc non est, et tu.
.	.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
This is not possible.	Hoc fieri non potest.
which I could never see.	quod numquam videre potui.
I heard no one.	Unum nihil audivi.
I think we play well.	Puto nos bene ludere.
Now or from the grid.	Nunc vel ex velit.
But, that is not true.	Verum, id verum non est.
That's easy to do.	Quod facile facias.
He saw her, and did not see him.	Vidit eam, et non vidit eum.
You can have him now if you want.	Eum nunc habere potes si vis.
It is something more.	Plus aliquid est.
He did it for him.	Fecit ei.
It's not so hard.	Non ita difficile est.
Now I could see.	Nunc videre potui.
I'm late.	Sero sum.
You are so good.	Tam bene.
in.	in.
That's never a problem for us.	Numquam nobis quaestio id.
He never wants to be the thing.	Rem sit numquam velit.
Take a look at this and why.	Vide hoc quare.
I thought maybe we should leave this behind.	Putavi fortasse nos hoc post nos relinquere.
To an.	Ad an.
He comes to me.	Ad me venit.
It is probable that both.	Probabile est utrumque.
As much as you want.	Quantum vis.
My name is not there.	Nomen meum non est ibi.
I hope you do this soon.	Spero te hoc cito.
Maybe he already had a wife and a house.	Fortasse iam habuit uxorem et domum.
But I started to think.	Sed incepit me cogitare.
I hope your day is well.	Spero te hodie bene.
He could not stop, but he did not.	Potuit prohibere, sed non fecit.
He was in school.	Erat in schola.
I couldn't believe when he told me.	Non potui credere cum mihi dixit.
But that's always before.	Sed id semper ante.
Maybe not.	Fortasse non.
I really got it.	Ego vere obtinuit eam.
And often it is.	Et saepe sit.
I've heard him say it often.	Audivi saepe eum dicere.
I don't think it will be today.	Non puto fore hodie.
He has good.	Bonum habet.
To get in was out.	Ut in erat ex.
He said so.	Dixit ita.
i saw her do it.	vidi eam facere.
Now he	Iam ille .
But I never really met.	Sed numquam vere occurrit.
That it may be so.	Ut ita sit.
No one wants it.	Nulla id velit.
This is not possible.	Id non potest.
I knew he would do it.	Sciebam, facturum esse.
But that's none of it.	Ut sed ipsum nulla.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
He could do it for sure.	Potuit certe.
I can see the problem.	Quaestionem videre possum.
You never know so much.	Numquam tu tantum scis.
I'm not sorry.	Non me paenitet.
It was already enough.	Jam satis erat.
None of him.	Nemo ex eo.
as we do.	sicut et nos.
He is alone here.	Solus hic est.
He knew that he could not.	Scivit se non posse.
Where they are right.	Ubi recte sunt.
But not great.	Sed non magna.
But it is not with me.	Sed non est apud me.
I've never met a man like him.	Nunquam occurrit ei similis homo.
That it has begun.	Quod incepit.
Being with her is important.	Esse apud eam sit amet.
But very well.	Sed valde bene.
I hope that's not true.	Spero quod non est.
I like this work.	Placet hoc opus.
It could never happen.	Fieri nunquam potuit.
But it was only said.	Sed non dictum nisi.
No one could speak.	Nemo dicere potuit.
I think all too!.	Puto quoque omnes!.
But it could not be done in its own time.	Sed suo tempore fieri non potuit.
He thought he was.	Putabat se esse.
You need to be done.	Opus tibi faciendum est.
That morning.	Quod mane.
now i have one.	nunc unum habeo.
not very hard.	Non admodum difficile.
I am afraid lest I see and do not understand and do not know.	Vereor ne videre et non intelligere et nescire.
It was scarcely possible.	Vix erat.
He would do something more, and think.	Aliquid plus facturum esse, et putare.
It can take some time.	Accipere aliquid temporis potest.
Sorry for the late post.	Nos paenitet nuper post.
He.	Ille.
Not the first time.	Non primum.
I am a morning person.	Ego homo sum mane.
So the thing is for you.	Ita res tibi ita est.
He refused to say why.	Noluit dicere quare.
I did not do this.	Non hoc facerem.
He does nothing wrong.	Nihil mali facit.
Maybe that was it.	Aliquam id erat.
I can't help you.	Non possum te adiuvare.
You are a man.	Vir es.
I certainly did not.	Ego certe non feci.
There's no fixed time yet.	Nulla tamen certum tempus.
I could not have done it.	Fieri non potui.
This has not just been done.	Hoc non modo factum est.
Something to do.	Aliquid facere.
It was enough, he thought.	Satis erat, putabat.
How much is this?	Quantum est hoc?
That's what it was before.	Ut quis erat ante.
It was never too late to be friends again.	Sero non erat iterum amicos esse.
But that's none.	Sed id nulla.
Right, that's who.	Recte, id est qui.
He also knows.	Ille etiam scit.
Never, never seen.	Nunquam, nunquam vidi.
To yourself.	Ut te ipsum.
But that's none of it.	Sed id nulla ex.
Tell yourself.	Dic tibi.
I didn't want to talk to him.	Nolui eum loqui.
None in the said no.	Nulla in dictum nulla.
It is better to give than to receive.	Melius est dare quam accipere.
That was exactly what he was thinking.	Prorsus id erat quod putabat.
I have a journey.	Habeo iter.
As it was.	Ut erat.
You are thinking.	Cogitas.
Maybe I should help you.	Forsitan ut te adiuvet.
He likes you.	Velit et.
No, not.	Non, non.
This was not true.	Hoc non fuit.
I do not want to do these things.	haec facere nolo.
He is really good, really, really good.	Is vere bonus est, vere, vere bonus.
So it is.	Ita est.
so great.	magna sic.
I know enough.	satis scio.
I feel very lucky to be here.	Sentio valde felix hic esse.
Do all things.	Omnia fac.
I.	Sum ego.
I like this enough.	Hoc satis placet.
She did what she could.	Id fecit quod potuit.
This is really good.	Hoc vere bonum est.
Everything about you.	Omnia de te.
He wants me to be himself.	Me quam ipsum velit.
I don't like to be honest here.	Non ut hic sit amet.
I am good to you.	bonus sum vobis.
It was a very good day.	Erat dies valde bonus.
I'm sorry.	Paenitet.
It seemed very impossible.	Videbatur admodum posse.
Him, Him.	Ipsum, ipsum.
I will tell you.	Dicam tibi.
I'll do it well.	Faciam ut te bene fac.
I have done it before.	Ante feci.
What's more, he's not going to do this job.	Quod plus est, ipse hoc officium non facturus est.
Maybe you did.	Fortasse fecisti.
But you do better quickly.	Sed tu melius fac cito.
They're something else.	Sunt aliquid aliud.
Now that's too little, too late.	Nunc id parum est, nimium sero.
It also has something in it.	Aliquid etiam in illa habet.
Something you need to know.	Aliquid scire debes.
No, not right.	Non, non recte.
looked pretty.	Vidit satis.
But it was time for him.	Sed tempus erat ut ipsum.
He does not say.	Non dicit.
He would not do this.	Hoc facere noluit.
Maybe better.	Melius fortasse.
What you said is nothing.	Quod dixisti, nihil est.
All this he says.	Hoc omnes dicit.
This is not going to happen.	Hoc non est futurum.
We don't like it.	Non placet nobis.
But today is not easy.	Sed hodie non est facile.
I think it is.	esse puto.
He said he was not doing this.	Dixit se hoc non facere.
I have seen this a lot.	multum hoc vidi.
i think i love you.	Puto te amo.
That would be bad.	Malum id esset.
this is between you and me.	hoc est inter me et te.
I love the one too.	Ego quoque unum amo.
He is my father.	Pater meus est.
He willed.	Voluit.
You've always just bought.	Semper te tantum emit.
Not so great.	Non ita magna.
but you know.	sed tu scis.
You know why you're like this.	Tu scis cur hoc simile sis.
Time fixed.	Tempus certum.
Now there is no need for us.	Nunc non est nobis opus.
I will not.	Nolo.
I guess they still aren't.	Suspicor tamen non sunt.
It was a good time for me.	Bonum tempus mihi fuit.
He was kind.	Erat genus.
that's order for you.	id est Ut tibi.
I've never seen any of this myself.	Id ipsum numquam aliquam.
You never know her.	Numquam eius.
Well, to us.	Bene, nobis.
There was none in the past.	Nulla in erat ante.
It has absolutely nothing to do with you.	Nihil prorsus ad te habet.
Or at least it used to be.	Vel certe sic esse solebat.
Both of these.	Utrumque.
I was here for a long time.	Hic diu eram.
Someone needs to know.	Scire debet aliquis.
He is a good man.	Bonus homo est.
Too much to do.	Nimium facere.
And it will not be.	Et non erit.
This is pretty good.	Hoc satis bonum est.
This was it.	Hoc erat illud.
It can't be anymore.	Non potest esse amplius.
We cannot live together.	Simul vivere non possumus.
You are thinking better.	Tu melius cogitas.
But he did not wish before.	Sed non velit ante.
You're only working.	Tantum opus es.
I still don't like this.	Hoc tamen tibi non placet.
Maybe not for long.	Aliquam non diu.
This can help.	Hic adiuvare potest.
Certainly not so.	Certe non ita est.
You perhaps don't.	Tu fortasse non facis.
He would not do it again.	Noluit iterum fieri.
In et in et.	In et in et.
With much to go.	Cum multo ad.
Well now it's not.	Bene iam non est.
That is nothing new here.	Id est, nihil novi hic.
You will probably be fine.	Tu probabiliter bene erit.
And what is more, three days from the time this took place.	Et quod plus est, tres dies ex quo hoc factum est.
He wasn't sure what he was going to do.	Non certus erat quid facturus esset.
But he would not listen.	Noluit autem audire.
Again he himself said.	Iterum dixit ipse.
But it is getting late.	Sed sero questus est.
Now that's none of it.	Nunc id ipsum nulla.
I don't know what will happen.	quid futurum sit nescio.
you know that I am there.	ibi me esse scis.
If you can't hear, you can see.	Si audire non potes, videre potes.
No one can.	Nemo potest.
How did he know?	Quomodo sciebat?
i never did.	numquam feci.
Everything that I've done so far.	Omnia quae feci usque.
I told him everything.	Dixi ei omnia.
They just can't be there.	Iustus non ibi.
One is never enough.	Numquam satis est unus.
I'm single after all.	Im unum post omnes.
I have been.	Fui.
Little does he know what it is.	Parum scit quid sit.
He was not sure what she was.	Non erat certus quod illa erat.
You won't need anything else.	Non opus erit tibi aliud.
I don't like this anymore.	Non placet hic amplius.
It's good to be with you.	Bonum est tibi esse.
Never tell anyone.	Numquam ad quis.
It is important.	Aliquam sit amet.
And good is one thing, and evil another.	Et aliud est bonum, et aliud malum.
Finally a.	Tandem a.
It is bad.	Malum est.
But it is true that everything is wrong.	Sed verum est quod omnia male.
And there is absolutely nothing wrong.	Et omnino nihil est mali.
Don't even feel bad about it.	Ne id quidem sentio malum.
I know people do that.	Scio homines facere.
You've been married for a long time.	Iam diu uxorem.
But you are still there.	Sed adhuc ibi es.
But to save him.	Sed ut ipsum nisi.
Maybe no one.	Aliquam quis nulla.
You tried, you know.	Conatus, scis.
No, it will not be.	Non, non erit.
But even if he wants.	Sed vel nisi velit.
Not right, I don't know.	Non recte, nescio.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
It was still late today.	Hodie adhuc sero erat.
It was going to happen but no one knew.	Quod futurum erat nisi nemo scivit.
Not for me.	Non mihi.
All in all it was on time.	Omnino erat in tempore.
Not much, for sure.	Non multum, certe.
They are not and never will be.	Non sunt et numquam.
But in him there was something.	Verum in eo erat aliquid.
Maybe that's said nothing.	Aliquam id dictum nisi.
It should not be done.	Fieri non debet.
That is better.	Illud melius est.
He ate hardly anything.	Vix quicquam comedit.
He was not kind.	Genus non erat.
There is a lot to know.	Est multum scire.
This he did.	Hoc fecit.
I hope good things.	Spero bona.
I often thought about how it was.	Saepe cogitavi quomodo esset.
This was true.	Hoc verum erat.
I just saw this post.	Hoc modo vidi post.
Maybe it would be better without him.	Forsitan melius sine eo esset.
It is well prepared.	Bene paratus sit.
I can't do this.	Non possum hoc facere.
There is.	Ibi est.
It's not much.	Non multum est.
It doesn't seem to want to talk.	Is loqui non videtur velle.
This one looks really pretty.	Et hoc unum spectat ad rem satis.
These things he said.	Haec ille.
This is exactly that.	Prorsus hic est.
But you are among your friends.	Sed inter amicos es.
You have a plan for this.	Pro hoc habes consilium.
Maybe that's great.	Aliquam id magna est.
That was not good.	Quod non erat bonum.
I don't know what he means.	Quid sibi velit nescio.
I don't regret either.	Non paenitet, vel.
This is my job.	Meum est officium.
i'm still.	sum usque.
I want to say something.	Dicere volo aliquid.
But neither was it said.	Sed nec dictum erat.
She could do nothing.	Quae facere nihil posset.
I have already made a decision.	Jam consilium feci.
This is what it looks like.	Hoc est quod is vultus amo.
it was still very bad.	adhuc nimis erat malum.
Now he wants to do what he wants.	Nunc velit id facere quod velit.
he did a.	FECIT a.
I'm going to him.	Eo ad eum.
He did not say where.	Non dixit ubi.
Yes I can do it myself.	Etiam id ipsum possum.
That's what he says.	Id quod dicit.
He knew how to do it well.	Scivit bene facere.
It's late this year's season.	Sero hoc anno est tempus.
He can probably play.	Probabiliter enim ludere potest.
Nothing is possible.	Nihil potest.
Soon it began.	Mox incepit.
My work can be seen here and here .	Opus meum hic et hic videri potest.
That's what I'll do.	Id faciam.
But probably not.	Sed verisimile non est.
It's time to be honest with yourself.	Aliquam sit amet ipsum ex.
It was time!	Tempus erat!
It's probably bad.	Malum est verisimile.
Now not.	Nunc non.
But he was there again.	Sed ibi iterum fuit.
Talk to him first.	Primum loqui ei.
He is from all.	Ipse ab omnibus.
All is well, everything is great.	Omnia bene, omnia magna.
As much as you can.	Quantum potes.
I don't know how or when but I got sick.	Nescio quomodo vel quando sed male obtinuit.
But he had nothing to do with it.	Sed ei id nihil.
I need you too.	Opus est tibi nimium.
You can have as much as you want.	Habere potes quantum vis.
I don't want to do that.	Quod facere nolo.
I never got it.	Numquam obtinuit eam.
I believe evil.	Malum credo.
I don't know how it was done, but it does.	Nescio quomodo factum sit, sed habet.
But rightly so.	Sed recte.
He does so today.	Hodie sic facit.
He ought to say nothing.	Nihil dicere debet.
It's time to do it before.	Aliquam id enim ante.
It may or may not be.	Vel ne sit.
You can do nothing about it now.	Nihil de hoc nunc facere potes.
It has more for you.	Non plus habet tibi.
So, you can find people who can do it.	Ita, homines invenire potes, qui id facere potes.
You don't know what you mean.	Non es scit quid velit.
Look at what's happened.	Vide quid acciderit.
and never	et numquam.
It looks like we are starting out.	Spectat ut sumus proficisci.
He still didn't understand who he was now.	Adhuc non intellexit quis nunc esset.
But there seemed to be something wrong with him.	Videbatur autem aliquid mali apud eum esse.
I don't want to travel this way.	Hoc iter facere nolo.
But please only do this one thing for me.	Sed quaeso tantum fac hoc unum mihi.
He would not come hither.	Noluit huc venire.
He saw what was done.	Vidit quod factum est.
I am my guy right now.	Ego guy nunc mea.
Let's be honest.	Sit sit amet.
Really good to see.	Vere bonum est videre.
he was in there.	erat in ibi.
Yes, that's how.	Etiam id quam quam.
Please tell me.	Dic quaeso.
This was a pretty good question.	Satis erat haec quaestio.
I want to live for this purpose.	Ad hanc rem vivere volo.
I told her I needed more money.	Dixi ei plus pecuniae opus esse.
And no one does anything about it.	Et nemo de illo aliquid facit.
That would be difficult.	Quod difficile esset.
I need to do something right.	Debeo aliquid recte facere.
that is who you are.	id est quis es.
sorry to see you.	Paenitet te videre.
There's again.	Ibi iterum est.
In the said period.	In dictum tempus.
I want to go.	Ire volo.
I know you are not coming.	Scio te non venire.
No it's out.	Nulla id est ex.
Not so easy.	Non ita facile .
You are too much.	Nimium es.
But how? 	Sed quomodo?
I could not reach him.	Ad eum non potui.
I wanted to be his.	eius esse volui.
And see it.	Et vide eam.
I like going very much.	Valde mihi placet ire.
He did not understand.	Non intellexit.
I do not think.	Non puto.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
At length he got it.	Tandem obtinuit.
See us there.	Vide ibi nos.
No one wished there was.	Nulla quis velit erat.
He said that he believed it.	Dixit ei credere se.
i can get it.	accipere possum.
There is little else to do.	Non parum est aliud facere.
I can do this work for you.	Hoc opus facere possum tibi.
What are you from.	Quod es a.
Until, you can do nothing.	Usque, nihil potes.
She speaks of everything.	Illa de omnibus loquitur.
I can't overcome this.	Hoc vincere non possum.
It has never been said before.	Numquam ante ei dictum est.
You can tell me something.	Mihi aliquid dicere potes.
I want nothing	Nihil volo .
I was ready for this.	paratus eram ad hoc.
So it is.	Ita est.
I'm not sure someone really can.	Non sum certus aliquis vere potest.
I will not tell you.	Non dicam tibi.
There was none.	Non fuit.
I am the only one who can talk about this.	Solus sum de hoc loqui potest.
To be seen.	Esse videri.
That's what I think.	Id puto.
But here you are again.	Sed hic tu iterum.
Well, not me.	Bene, non me.
Before long.	Multo ante.
There was none at all.	Nulla a aliquam erat.
Yes, that's a great time.	Etiam id tempus magna.
We don't have a lot of time.	Non multum temporis habemus.
and perhaps they are.	et fortasse sunt.
it was better to say that it was never done.	melius fuit dicere numquam factum esse.
That's his job.	Id eius officium est.
So there is need for us all.	Sic omnibus nobis opus est.
But yet it was time.	Sed sed tempus erat.
I just know for sure.	Modo certo scio.
I knew what this meant.	Sciebam quid hoc esset.
I really think this is the only one.	Ego vere hoc solum puto.
I know it's true.	Scio verum esse.
I'm going to help.	Eo auxilio.
That's just the time to do it.	Id temporis tantum facere.
it is not necessary.	non est necesse.
I don't know how this was done.	Nescio quomodo hoc factum sit.
Maybe it was always.	Aliquam semper erat.
You can't go this way.	Sic ire non potes.
It was already morning.	Mane iam erat.
In not great.	In non magna.
What I need to do now is act.	Quod nunc facere opus est, agere.
It was so.	Sic erat.
It doesn't look so bad either.	Nec male vultus quidem.
But it is in none.	Sed in nulla est.
When was this done?	Quando hoc factum est?
when work is necessary.	Cum opus est.
I'm afraid	Vereor ne.
he said that he wanted to buy it.	dixit se emere velle.
But you have.	Sed habes.
I just need you to know.	Modo te scire opus est.
Yes, it was not.	Etiam non erat.
I don't know what's going to happen.	Nescio quid futurum est.
Only time can tell what will happen.	Tantum temporis potest dicere quid futurum sit.
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
But even there he could not.	Sed vel ibi non potuit.
She didn't know what else to do.	Quid aliud facere illa nesciebat.
Here they are.	Hic sunt.
No one comes.	Nemo venit.
I always thought I was there.	Ibi semper putavi fuisse.
And no one knows where he is.	Et nemo scit ubi sit.
Well for the time being.	Bene ad tempus.
How he knew that he did not know.	Quomodo scivit se nescire.
It is for us.	Pro nobis est.
For this he ought to give all his counsel.	Ad hoc debet totum consilium dare.
Just never very good.	Iustus numquam valde bonus.
There she is now.	Ibi nunc est.
I am one father.	Pater unus sum.
And they are always there for each other.	Et ibi semper sunt inter se.
I guess this one is.	Suspicor, hoc unum est.
I totally forgot.	Prorsus oblitus sum.
This is going to work.	Hoc opus facturus est.
Tell me now.	Dic nunc mihi.
What he did not know.	Quid ille nesciebat.
That's who's there.	Quod quis ibi.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
He said this well.	Hoc bene dixit.
I could not believe this to be so.	Hoc ita fieri non potui credere.
Okay, so what's up.	Bene, sic quid novi est.
I don't want either of them.	Nolo utrumque.
This is just me.	Hic mihi est iustus.
But he never did it.	Numquam tamen id fecit.
He came home.	Domum venit.
He told him to go.	Dixit ei se proficisci.
And you are the only one.	Et tu solus es .
Yes okay.	Ita bene.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
There is no way to love yourself now.	Nulla ut ipsum nunc.
I am not going to work.	Non opus facturus.
I didn't know what to do.	nesciebam quid facerem.
This has to stop.	Hoc habet prohibere.
I looked like a boy.	Vidi sicut puer.
Which also he does.	Quod etiam facit.
Look, you can't think of everything.	Vide, non potes cogitare omnia.
It is not.	Non est.
he knows something.	aliquid novit.
There is no lunch.	Prandium non est.
Why is it? 	Cur est?
I am not good.	Non sum bonus.
One more is gone.	Unus plus abiit.
None is from none.	Nulla a nulla est.
Say something else.	Dic aliud.
He could not think of anything to say.	Nihil dicere potuit cogitare.
And perhaps.	Forsitan et.
Stay with him.	Mane cum eo.
But he does nothing.	Nihil tamen facit.
In this it is said.	In id dictum est.
But only as far as we can.	Sed tantum quantum possumus.
And yet he did it.	Quae tamen fecit.
It would seem that so.	Videtur quod sic.
Where, I ask?	Ubi, quaeso?
In the article above.	In in dictum est.
I know again.	Scio iterum.
But I want to do better.	Sed hoc melius facere volo.
And	Et.
She thought it was good.	Putavit bonum esse.
If you really want, do it yourself.	Si vere vis, fac te ipsum.
When this was done.	Quod cum factum esset.
It was going to happen.	Futurum erat.
I will not say.	Non dicam.
But it is enough.	Sed satis est.
Not after lunch yesterday.	Non post prandium heri.
I knew exactly what I wanted.	Prorsus sciebam quid vellet.
I wonder if he's ever been here.	Miror si hic umquam fuit.
The time has finally come.	Tempus tandem venit.
There is no one with him.	Unus cum eo non est.
Yes it is here.	Ita est hic.
Your checklist is not working here.	Genus hic tuum non opus est.
But there was none.	Nulla sed erat.
Not in me yet.	Non in me tamen.
This may or may not be correct yet.	Hoc fortasse vel non recte tamen.
Yes and it was said out loud.	Etiam et dictum magna.
That's what I'll do.	Id faciam.
There is no great saying in it.	Nulla in dictum magna.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
There was so much to do!	Tantum facere erat!
It was his job.	Eius officium erat.
Who he was.	Qui erat.
As always said loud.	Ut semper dictum magna.
But you are in your hands.	Sed tu in tua.
We cannot discuss this here.	De hoc hic non possumus.
It is and is it.	Est et esse id.
Yours is the problem.	Tuum est quaestio esse.
I never met.	Numquam occurrit.
Time itself is time.	Tempus ipsum tempus.
What do you want to see through him?	Quid per eum vis videre?
Probably not so well.	Verisimiliter non ita bene.
To be alone.	Ad solum esse.
But he could never find him.	Verum nunquam potuit eum invenire.
to swim a lot.	Natare multum.
This is quite probable.	Hoc satis probabile est.
Now not yourself.	Nunc nec ipsum.
I couldn't get enough of that.	Non potui satis, de illa.
It is difficult to know.	Difficile est scire.
You know as mine.	Tu scis, ut meus.
No need to know.	Nec scire opus est.
It will be fine now.	Nunc bene erit.
No, not you.	Non, non te.
I am the only person.	Homo sum solus.
Always and always.	Semper et semper.
He does not say that both are true.	Non dicit utrumque verum esse.
It is.	Sic est.
We need to stop it.	Necesse est nos eam prohibere.
There was no need for help.	Auxilium opus non erat.
He did it for himself.	Sibi ipse fecit.
he would not do it at all.	id omnino non facturum.
All right, though.	Recte, sed.
They are great.	Magna sunt.
Who and whom.	Quis et quo.
It looks like you.	Spectat ut te.
Who speaks here?	Quis hic loquitur?
Everything is fine.	Omnia bene est.
But not.	Sed non.
No one can tell you when either.	Nemo tibi dicere potest, cum vel.
Well not long.	Bene non diu.
This is something for everyone.	Hic aliquid est omnibus.
Or buy us.	Vel emere nos.
There was no one wished.	Non erat quis velit.
I know what you will do.	Scio quid facturus sit.
And he did not tell it.	Et non indicavit.
It is not enough.	Non satis esse.
And this will be.	Et hoc erit.
Don't deal with me.	Ne me facias.
He said not much.	Non multum dixit.
Something else.	Aliquid aliud.
But who was he whom he wished.	Sed quis quam velit erat.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
Now that's it.	Nunc ut enim est.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
I have nothing for you.	Non habeo quod tibi.
No one can do it for us.	Nemo nobis id facere potest.
All things are.	Omnes res est.
There's never a problem.	Nulla umquam quaestio est.
But here is the time.	Sed hic tempus est.
I love you baby.	Amo te, puer.
You also .	Tu quoque .
I just didn't want to talk to him anymore.	Modo noluit loqui ei amplius.
not too often.	Non nimis saepe.
It is scarce.	Vix est.
Again it's not.	Iterum suus.
I want to talk about you.	de te loqui volo.
That's not going to happen.	Quod non futurum est.
Now I need it.	Nunc opus est.
But this is true.	Sed hoc vere.
He has nothing to say to her.	Non habet ei quicquam dicere.
Maybe I can't see anything.	Fortasse aliquid videre non potest.
I knew.	Sciebam.
Now he doesn't want to play at all.	Iam omnino ludere non vult.
As it was before.	Ut erat ante.
We thought they could be friends.	Putavit nos amicos esse posse.
It seemed to do the work.	Opus facere videbatur.
I thought about getting up and working on something.	Cogitavi de questus et opus ad aliquid.
The dog does not come.	Canis non venit.
I do not know.	Nescio.
often I do.	saepe facio.
You, boy.	Tu, puer.
But even if it were true.	Sed etiam si verum esset.
has a plan.	consilium habet.
It was not enough.	Parum fuit.
Of him also he seemed right.	De illo quoque recte videbatur.
I don't feel good right now.	Non iam bene sentio.
It is important.	Aliquam sit amet.
Even my husband got it.	Etiam vir meus obtinuit.
I am with you all.	Ego cum omnibus.
This was not what you ever thought you wanted.	Hoc non erat quod putavit umquam velle.
It was work in the morning.	Mane opus erat.
Almost all of this is not true.	Fere omnes id non verum.
It certainly happened.	Factum certe.
We need to do better.	Melius nobis opus est facere.
He got nothing.	Nihil obtinuit.
You have done this.	Hoc fecisti.
You're not a very good guy.	Nimis bonus es guy non.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
He does not do these things himself.	Haec ipse non facit.
Do better if you can.	Melius fac, si potes.
Just as important as time.	Tam magna quam tempus.
An ex est, ex est ex.	An ex est, ex est ex.
In.	In.
He knew he couldn't do it.	Scivit se non facere.
He did nothing.	Nihil fecit.
To be himself.	Sibi esse.
A lot of time to do it.	Multum temporis facere.
They are all here!	Omnes hic sunt!
he could not do it.	facere potuit.
Is there someone else?	Estne aliquis?
It is what it is.	Est, quid est.
It was too late to go home.	Sero erat domum ire.
Yes this has been said before.	Etiam id dictum ante.
One work at a time.	Unum opus ad tempus.
I'll do it for you.	Faciam ut tibi.
This was the plan.	Hoc consilium fuit.
That's up to you.	Id ad vos.
Maybe it's great.	Aliquam sed magna est.
I like to do some more than that.	Ut non aliquam quam.
So pretty much okay.	Ita fere bene.
But not out of nothing.	Sed non ex nulla.
There is also.	Est etiam.
But it was not him.	Sed non erat ipsum.
I don't mean to be.	Non vult esse.
But that has nothing to do with me.	Sed id nihil ad mea.
That is so.	Id ita sit.
What was truly said.	Quod vere dictum est.
It will not be.	Non erit.
One thing.	Unum.
I could not speak.	Non potui dicere.
You can't do this.	Hoc non potes.
whither he went.	Quo abiit.
A good man and a good man.	Vir bonus et bonus.
It's what you do.	Est quod facis.
However, you need to know if this is going to happen.	Tamen scire debes si hic futurum est.
He was mine.	Meus erat.
He could not think like this.	Non potuit se sic cogitare.
That's a very bad thing.	Valde id malum.
Never let him down.	Numquam eum.
No one is there.	Nulla quis est.
It's gonna be great.	Sed amet magna.
I just know what you mean.	Ego iustus est scire quid sit.
I don't need you anymore.	Non opus est tibi amplius.
You know that is great.	Scis, quae magna est.
And it was still late.	Et adhuc sero erat.
I will not tell you how it was done.	Non dicam tibi quomodo factum sit.
There was nothing else to do.	Aliud non erat facere.
Maybe that's the same thing.	Id ipsum fortasse.
Not for me, but.	Non mihi, sed.
You said that you were certain.	Certum te esse dixisti.
Or how to get out of it.	Vel quam ut ex.
There is none in him.	Nulla in ipsum nulla.
I see it here.	Hic video esse.
He says to do, but not tomorrow.	Dicit facere, sed non cras.
not better than that.	Non melius quam.
It was very important.	Aliquam sit amet ipsum erat.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
I was kind there.	Genus ibi fui.
I can't stop.	Non possum prohibere.
To be honest no.	Ut sit amet nulla.
It made him look.	Is vultus ei fecit.
I was almost there.	Fere non eram.
Not yet enough yet.	Nondum satis adhuc.
No one could hear her.	Nemo eam audire potuit.
But not only.	Sed non nisi.
I'm okay with that.	Sum bene esse.
That's what it was for us.	Id quod erat nobis.
Really didn't know what could be done.	Vere nesciebam quid fieri posset.
Why do you think this was done?	Cur hoc factum putas?
But he could not conceive of saying a thing.	Sed non potuit cogitare rem dicere.
I was sure.	Certus eram.
I want to know.	Scire volo.
Which is different.	Quod est aliud.
At home, in school.	Domi, in schola.
I don't want to be there.	Ibi esse nolo.
As it was said.	Ut id dictum erat.
He would not do this.	Hoc non facturum.
It was a great time.	Tempus erat magna.
I know you are not good.	Scio non esse bonum.
First off I don't know what it is.	Primum quid sit nescio.
I haven't done, well, enough time.	Non factum est, bene, satis temporis.
You're in the video.	In video es.
This evil will never happen.	Numquam malum hoc futurum est.
None either.	Nulla vel.
It is an obligation.	Officium est.
It is not enough work.	Parum est opus.
Someone help me with this.	Hoc me aliquis adiuvet.
In other words, we don't have a job.	Id est, officium non habemus.
It is not exactly true.	Prorsus non est verum.
I've done that before.	Feci quod ante.
It was good, but not great.	Bonum erat, sed non magna.
It can't be.	Non potest esse.
Not in this way.	Nec hoc modo.
No id right now.	Nulla id nunc.
But it never was.	Verum nunquam fuit.
You are doing well.	Bene facis.
In order to be yourself.	In et ipsum ut.
Yes, but it was always.	Etiam sed semper erat.
That seemed to tell.	Id narrare videbatur.
She is very busy and doesn't have time for this.	Valde occupatus est, nec tempus habet ad hoc.
It's up to you on time.	Est ad vos in tempore.
Or who wants.	Vel quis velit.
I thought it was yours.	Tuum esse putabam.
Time is not with you.	Tempus non est tecum.
He was already sure.	Jam certus erat.
Do you have a dog?	Habesne canem?
I like talking about you.	Placet de te.
Why didn't he say it.	Cur non dixit.
If he wants.	Si velit.
The race was tense.	Genus eius temporis fuit.
There was not much to be done.	Non multum erat ei faciendum.
He did not want me to come.	Noluit me venire.
Even not great.	Etiam non magna.
I knew exactly what I wanted.	Prorsus sciebam quid vellet.
But it is not that.	Sed non est id.
He has nothing.	Nihil habet.
They are there too.	Ibi etiam sunt.
It's very sad.	Est nimis.
Not all, probably.	Non omnes, probabiliter.
He cannot speak.	Loqui non potest.
Or stay exactly where you are.	Vel manere prorsus ubi sis.
Who truly loves you for who you are.	Quis enim te vere amat quis es.
To me indeed everything.	Mihi quidem omnia.
I hope you're doing the same.	Spero te idem facere.
It could not have been much better.	Multo melius ei fuisse non potuit.
He thought he was a good man.	Vir bonus putavit.
He did not know what to do.	Nesciebat id.
At length he understood.	Tandem intellexit.
Almost no one knows about you.	Fere nemo de te novit.
Yes they are.	Ita sunt.
It's just gone.	Suus 'iustus abiit.
This year is nothing new.	Hoc anno nihil novi est.
I don't.	Non facio.
which I do not know.	quae nescio quae.
There I am.	Ibi ego.
That was hard.	Quod erat difficile.
We have a plan for it.	Consilium habemus pro eo.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Forsitan id bonum.
But this was done in such a way.	Sed hoc ita factum est.
But that's not great.	Sed non id magna.
I can't leave you here.	Te hic relinquere non possum.
But as time goes by.	Sed ut tempus ipsum.
Not much.	Non multum.
You are so, as I always said.	Sic es, ut semper dixi.
It has been so long.	Tam diu fuit.
Well, well, this is not true.	Bene, bene, hoc non est verum.
I haven't seen yet.	Non vidi tamen.
That it is so.	Quod ita sit.
I'm going right now.	Eo modo recte.
Both of these.	Utrumque.
But you know how it is.	Sed quomodo sit scis.
There is still a lot of work to do.	Adhuc multum opus est facere.
He was also in him.	Etiam in ipsum erat.
Yes and how.	Etiam et quam quam.
Not for me.	Non mihi.
Not even one.	Ne unus quidem.
Something you will never do.	Aliquid numquam facere.
Well at least it is.	Bene certe sic est.
you'd like to get even with me somehow.	ut etiam apud me velis aliquo modo.
And there are many things about him.	Et multa sunt de illo.
We don't have enough money.	Non satis pecuniae habemus.
It's time to go there.	Aliquam ut nulla erat.
That's it now.	Id nunc.
And say so.	Et dic ita.
It has not been for years.	Annos non fuit.
And so it is necessary.	Et sic necesse est.
Maybe it is.	Forte, est.
Nothing is better.	Nihil melius est.
It is necessary to stop this now.	Hoc nunc prohibere necesse est.
This is certainly true for me.	Hoc certe verum est mihi.
And this was all, absolutely all.	Et hoc erat totum, omnino omnia.
This certainly had.	Hoc certe habuit.
He had a house.	Habuit domum.
There is no id.	Nulla id.
I made money.	Pecuniam feci.
I could not, not in any way he could.	Non potui, non quo modo posset.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
He did not do this.	Hoc non fecit.
What if.	Quid si.
It is difficult to believe.	Difficile est credere.
But don't stay there.	Sed noli ibi manere.
I need her help.	Auxilio eius mihi opus est.
He speaks to everyone.	Ad omnes loquitur.
But he would not.	Noluit autem.
I don't want to go that way.	Nolo illuc ire.
But he can't help.	Sed adiuvare non potest.
But never again.	Sed numquam iterum.
We all deal with him.	Nos omnes cum eo agere.
For it was good.	Erat enim bona.
I told you this afternoon.	Haec post meridiem tibi dixi.
He wanted to give him everything.	Omnia ei dare voluit.
Please do.	Fac quaeso.
No, it is not possible.	Non, non potest.
And so you can.	Et sic potes.
It was somebody.	Erat quis.
Yes, it will be fine.	Ita, bene erit.
I'm sorry for him.	Paenitet me eum.
This was not necessary.	Hoc non erat necesse.
Maybe he does.	Fortasse facit.
If it is not one thing, it is another.	Si aliud non est, aliud est.
Which is not evil, but is not good.	Quod malum non est, sed nec bonum est.
Certainly.	Certe.
You know more than you.	Plus scis quam tu.
We can't do it.	Facere non possumus.
He could too.	Potuit quoque.
He buys the book.	Librum emit.
Now he was behind him.	Nunc post ipsum erat.
He makes so much money.	Tantum pecuniae facit.
He could not believe what he said.	Non potuit credere quod dixit.
They're late to work.	Sunt nuper ad opus.
There was nothing in it.	Nulla in erat nisi.
Not at this time.	Non hoc tempore.
That's it here.	Id hic.
No one knows.	Nemo scit.
Please, please help me.	Quaeso, quaeso, auxilium.
Yes that always is.	Etiam id semper est.
Maybe that was none.	Aliquam id nulla erat.
I hope you are too.	Spero te quoque.
I really like it.	Vere mihi placet.
This could not have been done.	Hoc fieri non potuit.
But I got the job.	Sed officium obtinuit.
But it was not certain what.	Sed non erat certum quid.
you're with him.	tu cum eo.
i'm a boy	puer sum
I don't know much.	Non multum scire.
I want them all.	Volo autem omnes.
I know for sure that you will do the same.	Idem te facturum certo scio.
But right now.	Sed modo recte.
You can't think.	Cogitare non potes.
Not this boy.	Non hic puer.
It was said to him, but not good.	Dictum ei sed bona.
I don't want you.	Nolo te.
That's some time at the same time.	Id per idem tempus aliquam.
This is exactly the same.	Hoc idem prorsus.
You are one.	Unus es.
I can't really go over and over.	Non possum vere ire et in.
He wanted to know why.	Scire voluit quare.
You tell us.	Tu nobis dic.
Hardly, but well.	Vix, sed bene.
I never heard of him.	Numquam de eo audivi.
Maybe that was it.	Aliquam id erat.
I did it myself.	Ipse feci.
It's too hard.	Nimis difficile est.
Certainly it is the same now.	Certe nunc simile est.
You'd better know.	Melius scire velis.
You are still.	Tu tamen es.
He is going to see you.	Eat te videre.
I have heard.	Audivi.
Where do you want to go?	Quo ire vis?
There was something to do.	Non erat aliquid facere.
yes i like dog.	Etiam canis mihi placet.
I can't believe I did this.	Non possum credere me hoc fecisse.
You are still.	Tu tamen es.
I had this.	Hoc habui.
Thus and this.	Sic et hoc.
You just don't have it.	Vos iustus non eam.
I could never do it again.	Numquam iterum facere potui.
That's exactly what I didn't want.	Prorsus quod nolebat.
i've never done it before.	numquam ante id feci.
It is certain that you can do it.	Certum est te facere posse.
It is also great, great.	Etiam magna magna.
This was better for me.	Hoc melius mihi fuit.
It's time to see if you can.	Aliquam video, si potes.
That has to stop.	Quod habet prohibere.
He did this before.	Ante hoc fecit.
And yet.	Et adhuc.
It was good, too.	Bonum erat, etiam.
This never does.	Hoc nunquam facit.
And now he has.	Et nunc habet.
You can do it now.	Nunc id facere potes.
He still has a house there.	Habet adhuc ibi domum.
But there is nothing wrong.	Tamen nihil mali est.
No, not enough.	Non, non satis.
There was no such thing.	Nulla id erat.
Your name.	Nomen tuum.
So make one.	Ita fac unum.
We need to win to see this.	Vincere opus est hoc videre.
and it could be done.	et posset.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Exactly as stated.	Prorsus ut dictum est.
it is certain for me.	certum est mihi.
I don't need to do that.	Non opus est facere.
Who did not tell.	Quis non indicavit.
It was never long enough.	Satis diu fuit numquam.
It is not so certain.	Non ita certum est.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
He did not know why.	Cur nesciebat.
There you go again.	Ibi tu iterum.
I don't know how it was better tonight.	Nescio quomodo hac nocte melius fuit.
He knew what was there.	Sciebat quid ibi esset.
But he could not.	Sed non potuit.
I can't talk to him.	Non possum dicere ei.
Is it me? 	Estne mihi?
Don't tell who you are.	Non dicam quis sis.
I don't know who it is.	Nescio quis sit.
I've never heard anything like that.	Nunquam quicquam simile audivi.
That's what I got lucky with.	Hoc est quod felix cum obtinuit.
I could do more, better.	Potui, plus, melius.
By the way right.	A modo recte.
He did not even give it to me.	Nec mihi quidem dedit.
But this is not true, no more.	Sed hoc non est verum, non amplius.
I know nothing, I will say nothing.	Nihil novi, nihil dicam.
Perhaps he understood.	Forsitan et ipse intellexit.
That's not the same thing.	Ut nec ipsum.
This one does.	Hoc unum facit.
Tell her how much she wanted me.	Dicere ei quantum vellet me.
No one wanted to do this.	Nemo hoc facere voluit.
Who's traveling alone?	Quis solus iter?
He also wants what was said.	Etiam id dictum velit.
You don't need to talk.	Loqui non opus est.
I ought to have been something more.	Me plus aliquid debere fuisse.
There is no plan.	Non est consilium.
He did not do this.	Hoc non fecit.
Maybe it was even more than that.	Aliquam vel erat quam.
There you know now.	Ibi nunc scis.
You can do so many things.	Tam multa potes.
Yes, that was how.	Etiam id erat quam.
I think it was in New Orleans.	Aliquam in erat puto.
Mine is yours.	Meum est quod tuum est.
But it was not this.	Sed non hoc erat.
Maybe that's it.	Id forte.
Most likely he did it.	Verisimile id fecit.
I have friends.	amicos habeo.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
It's trying to be the best person to be.	Optime conatur ut homo suus suus sit.
My thing is to know.	Mihi res est scire.
I don't need to know.	Non opus est scire.
I saw, and I saw.	Vidi, et vidi.
But that's not even enough.	Sed ne id quidem satis.
I couldn't do it right at the time.	Non potui recte facere tempore.
And you're very happy.	Et nimium felix.
Maybe a little too much.	Forsitan parum nimis.
You can do it again.	Iterum facere potes.
This is one thing.	Hoc est unum.
Even not great.	Etiam non magna.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
She thought he knew something.	Putavit se aliquid scire.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
There is something here.	Est aliquid hic.
In not always yourself.	In non semper ipsum.
Or they may not.	Vel ut non.
and he loves his job.	et officium suum amat.
He said that it was yours.	Dixit tuum esse.
He never does.	Numquam facit.
None of the above.	Nulla in dictum est.
It's not about me.	Hoc non est de me.
But it is not seen.	Sed non videtur.
I wanted something more.	Plus aliquid volui.
I know nothing about him.	nihil de eo scio.
It's hard to make friends.	Difficile est amicos facere.
I hope nothing's wrong.	Spero nihil mali.
I want.	Volo.
In a great way.	In magna magna.
But no, that's not very bad.	Sed non id ipsum non male.
Certainly you know.	Certe scis.
I am not good at this.	Non sum bonum hoc.
Let me tell you something about me.	Dicam tibi aliquid de me.
met there? 	Ibi occurrit?
So tell me what you want.	Ita dic quod vis.
Both are very good.	Utrumque valde bonum est.
To do something.	Facere aliquam.
He was not there.	Non erat ibi.
No it is not.	Nulla non est.
We can't be late.	Sero esse non possumus.
Not so much.	Non tantum.
Do as you want.	Fac sicut vis.
That's something.	Id aliquid.
But you can't.	Sed non potes.
Even to win is not necessary.	Etiam vincere non est necesse.
I want us to have good advice.	Volo nos habere consilium bonum.
I like it indeed.	Mihi quidem placet.
But here	Sed hic.
The same with me.	Idem apud me.
there was so much to do.	tantum erat facere.
The three of us together.	Tres nos simul.
But no no no.	Sed non nulla nulla.
He knew where she was.	Ubi scivit eam esse.
This is my bedroom.	Cubiculum meum est.
If the truth is too good, it is likely.	Si verum nimis bonum est, verisimile est.
Say sorry.	Dic me paenitet.
But this is necessary.	Sed hoc opus est.
It's not going to happen.	Non futurum est.
It is not gone.	Non sic abiit.
nor yet.	nec tamen.
This is his thing.	Haec res eius est.
For he knew that there was something else about him.	Sciebat enim aliud esse de eo.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
I admire you very much.	Miror te valde.
I can't do this.	Non possum hoc facere.
Your job is to make it easy.	Tuum officium est id facile facere.
There will be time for that.	Erit tempus illud.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
That is.	Id est.
So many things.	Tam multa.
It's me, not you.	Est mihi, nec est tibi.
And we are one.	Et nos unum sumus.
Yes that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum.
You never know when it's going to be.	Numquam te cum futurum esse scis.
I know that he was pretty sure.	Satis certo scio eum fuisse.
It's too much for you to think.	Nimium est te cogitare.
I hope it helps you too.	Spero te quoque adiuvet.
He does not do much.	Ipse non multum.
I just wanted him to know what he knew.	Modo voluit eum scire quod scivit.
But that was quickly.	Sed id cito erat.
That was never said.	Quod numquam dictum est.
It's not just a bad decision.	Non est id solum malum consilium.
But that's no great thing.	Sed id nulla magna.
Well, not right.	Bene, non recte.
It's not easy.	Non est facile.
I never wanted.	Numquam volui.
You need to see people.	Videre debes homines.
You can't.	Non potes.
But also for him.	Sed et ipsum enim.
one and made.	unum et factum.
Yes, that was great.	Etiam id magna erat.
This one is much better.	Hoc unum multo melius est.
It should not be so.	Sic non debet.
I didn't know where it was.	Ego nesciebam ubi esset.
may have been.	potest fuisse.
This can indeed be done in this way.	Quod quidem potest hoc modo fieri.
Well, enough.	Bene, satis.
Good to have advice.	Bonum habere consilium.
I've been doing this for a long time.	Fui hoc diu.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
In.	In.
Yes, that's how.	Etiam id quam quam.
i did it.	ego feci.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
He never did.	Qui non numquam.
I don't think he wants to go home!	Non puto domum ire velle!.
if not longer.	si non diutius.
He loves you.	Amat te.
This is not a bad time for us.	Hoc non est malum tempus nobis.
Nothing else but really.	Nihil aliud quam vere.
I think of him a little.	Puto eum, parum.
I must be with you.	debeo apud te esse.
This is.	Hic est.
I like it enough.	Mihi satis placet.
Nothing is enough.	Nihil satis.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
Who was.	Quis erat.
It was hard.	Difficile erat.
So she thought better.	Melius sic putavit.
That's it now.	Id nunc.
You will still need it.	Adhuc opus erit.
Where has he gone?	Quo abiit?
Yes that is.	Etiam id est.
Maybe you can talk to him.	Forsitan ei loqui potes.
No one could do it.	Nemo id facere potuit.
i love it i love it.	amo eam amo.
Yes but there is none.	Etiam sed est nulla.
This is not even easy to say.	Ne id quidem facile dictum est.
It's not out of there.	Etiam non ex enim.
This is not possible.	Hoc fieri non potest.
You don't want to be like this.	Simile tibi hic esse non vis.
I've never seen him.	Nunquam eum vidi.
You are right.	Recte facis.
I'm not totally sure.	Prorsus non sum certus.
He was not prepared to give up.	Nec paratus dare.
Not a dog, either.	Non canis , vel .
and we can speak.	et loqui possumus.
I did so too.	Feci ita etiam.
You can do this ahead of time.	Hoc facere potes ante tempus.
Everything is fine.	Bene omnia est.
sorry for not being in.	Paenitet te non esse in.
I told him again.	Iterum ei dixi.
He told me that it was not a problem one more time.	Dixit mihi unum tempus quaestio non esse.
All is well now.	Omnia iam bene.
Please tell me the truth.	Placet mihi verum dicere.
And you're late.	Et sero es.
It can't be too bad.	Nimis malum esse non potest.
It is a bad name.	Nomen malum est.
It's all up to her.	Suus omnia ad eam.
I like it better.	Id melius placet.
It makes it possible.	Fieri facit.
But there was nothing.	Sed nihil erat.
I really love you.	Ego vere amo.
He will not be mine.	Meus non erit.
But this does not please the whole truth.	Sed hoc non placet totum verum.
Nor was anyone.	Nec quis erat.
I am sure it is fine.	Mihi certe bene est.
He does not do what he says.	Non facit quod dicit.
I don't know whether it was or not.	Nescio an fuit vel non fuit.
Now not great.	Nunc nec magna.
He wants you to have lunch too.	Te quoque prandium habere vult.
I could not believe it.	Ut non posset credere.
I don't know who's from.	Nescio quis a.
That is, no.	Id est, nulla.
Either it was, or it was.	Vel erat, vel id.
I know, but .	Scio, sed .
No, please.	Non, velit.
I don't want to go.	ire nolo.
You know, but me.	Scis, verum me.
He asked her a question.	Quaesivit eam quaestionem.
Which was better.	Quod erat melius.
to do, he did.	facere, fecit.
Not much.	Non multum.
We've never been here before.	Nos numquam hic ante.
Better late than never.	Melius sero quam numquam.
He wants him to be.	Ut velit ipsum.
This is.	Hic est.
I don't know what that is.	Quid id sit nescio.
He says well.	Bene dicit.
I'm sorry to say that.	Me paenitet dicere.
Everything still looked good.	Omnia adhuc vidi bona.
Nothing bad about him.	Nihil de eo male.
I tried to say something.	Conatus est aliquid dicere.
never do you.	numquam tu.
This is what you want to find.	Hoc est quod vis invenire.
Well, probably.	Satis, verisimile.
But you alone can do this.	Sed tu solus potes hoc facere.
Yes, he is going to school.	Etiam scholam eat.
I have done nothing there.	Nihil ibi feci.
No if you don't want to.	Non si non vis.
I don't just talk here.	Hic non solum loqui.
I would like to meet someone.	Occurrit aliquis vellem.
How great was it.	Quam magna erat.
I love him so much.	Eum ut amo.
But he could not do this.	Sed hoc facere non potuit.
He was certain of himself.	De se certum erat.
We cannot do this.	Hoc fieri non possumus.
I want to give you everything about me.	Volo tibi omnia de me dare.
indeed I was.	vere fui.
You did so.	Fecisti ita.
But you can't do it now.	Sed tu modo non potes.
I've never seen him before.	Nunquam ante illum vidi.
Well almost everyone.	Bene fere omnes.
But neither is the time itself.	Sed nec tempus ipsum.
People want them to do the right thing.	Homines in se vis recte facere.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
Well, maybe now.	Bene, fortasse nunc.
Or tell me what you know.	Vel dic quid scis.
That's not what he wants to win.	Quod non est vincere velit.
How can i do it.	Quomodo possum facere.
That is exactly between the two.	Id est, prorsus inter utrumque.
I'm not there right now.	Non sum ibi nunc.
may not always exist.	Ut non semper est.
I don't want to live like this.	Sic vivere nolo.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
That he wanted to live again.	Quod iterum vivere voluit.
No but ever before.	Nulla sed semper ante.
He is my dog.	Canis meus est.
But that was great.	Sed id magna erat.
I never did, I never did.	Nunquam feci, nunquam feci.
So he did not.	Ita non habuit.
The thing is.	In res est.
Maybe it wasn't.	Fortasse non erat.
Well yes.	Etiam bene.
As if.	Ut si.
Be sure that you are right.	Vide ut recte.
I need to talk to you again.	Mihi opus est tibi iterum dicere.
If not.	Quod si non.
It was good.	Bonum erat.
I just don't think so.	Modo non videtur.
Or at least not so much.	Vel certe, non tam.
I don't know who you are.	Nescio quis sis.
He is also very happy.	Etiam sit amet ipsum est.
It is still today.	Adhuc hodie est.
It is much, but it is little.	Multum est, sed parum est.
I don't know what will happen tomorrow.	quid cras futurum sit nescio.
I never thought I would be here.	Numquam hic putavi fore.
This is for you.	Hoc pro vobis est.
He quickly did it.	Cito fecit.
I don't feel well.	Non bene sentio.
I just don't do anything.	Non solum non aliquid.
i did it for a year.	feci pro anno.
as much as i can say.	quod multa possum dicere.
He was there to help.	Erat ibi auxilio.
No one wanted to know anything.	Nemo aliquid scire voluit.
I can't do what you can't.	Non possum fieri, quod non potes.
There was no need.	Non opus fuit.
But this would not be so.	Sed hoc non esset.
He is a dog.	Canis est.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
I can't be certain.	Certum esse non possum.
My order is to do the job.	Meus ut sit facere officium.
Do all this.	Hoc totum fac.
I don't think it's good.	Non puto bonum esse.
But he could not.	Sed non potuit.
So perhaps he saw nothing really.	Ita fortasse nihil vere vidit.
It was good, but it could have been better.	Bonum fuit, sed melius fieri potuit.
He was certainly not here.	Hic certe non erat.
Very good man.	Valde bonus homo.
I'm really sorry, but .	Sum vere paenitet, sed .
Or not one.	Vel non unum.
I need to go help.	Ire debeo auxilium.
He doesn't have much.	Multum non habet.
has to be.	habet esse.
Now you can.	Nunc potes.
Not much.	Non multum.
I just wasn't ready to tell her everything.	Modo non paratus eram omnia ei narrare.
I am so happy to do this job.	Ego sum tam felix hoc facere officium.
No one knows.	Nemo scit.
He can't have a date, he said.	Diem habere non potest, dixit.
I know him better than you.	Novi eum melius quam tu.
he was a teacher.	magister erat.
It is enough, it is enough.	Jam satis est, satis est.
If they are great.	Si sunt, magna.
And the dog is.	Et canis est.
I probably will.	Probabiliter ego.
No but for you.	Nulla sed enim.
I like you to do it.	Ego amo te ut facias.
Do this again as soon as possible.	Iterum hoc quam primum fac.
Maybe he would.	Fortasse vellet.
we have everything.	omnia habemus.
Not well.	Non bene.
Now not great.	Nunc non magna.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
No, that was great.	Nulla id magna erat.
It can't be seen what it is.	Non potest videri quid sit.
All right, though.	Recte, sed.
So there is more money.	Sic plus pecuniae est.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
That decision will get you where you want to go.	Consilium illud tibi erit quo vis ire.
One where you are.	Una, ubi es.
From behind me.	A post me.
This is my job right now.	Meum est officium nunc.
No one wants to speak out.	Nemo ex dicere velit.
He's great.	Ille magna.
Now it is not said.	Nunc nec dictum est.
At that time there was no one	Illo tempore nemo erat
He was not certain.	Certum non erat.
So you can't speak from this.	Sic ex hoc loqui non potes.
You can do everything.	Potes omnia facere.
He can no longer find his wife.	Uxorem suam amplius invenire non potest.
There was not much to tell.	Non fuit id quod multa narrare.
No one ever thought this would happen.	Nemo umquam hoc futurum putabat.
We can come after all.	Post omnes possumus venire.
But as stated above.	Sed ut dictum est.
It is certain.	Certum est.
She wants me to come and talk with him.	Illa me venire vult, et cum eo loqui.
Now this is certain.	Nunc id certum est.
that would be good.	id esset bonum.
Not even that.	Non id quidem.
and got to do it.	et obtinuit ut facias.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
Or what you didn't do before.	Vel id quod ante non.
But somehow.	Sed nescio quo modo.
It was a good question.	Bona quaestio fuit.
You know that way, you know what it is and what's wrong.	Scis illuc, scis quid sit et quid mali.
To none of us.	Ut non ex nobis.
Do not speak thus.	Noli sic loqui.
and to speak to him.	& loqui ei.
He was good to me.	Mihi bonus erat.
Maybe that's great.	Aliquam id magna est.
for he thought what he needed to do.	Putabat enim id quod opus erat facere.
Don't say anything wrong about him.	Noli de eo male dicere.
You should have this.	Debes hoc habere.
He willed.	Voluit.
I do.	Facio.
We just want you to feel happy.	Nos iustus volo vos sentio felix.
Something fun here.	Aliquid amet hic.
I was there too.	Ibi quoque eram.
Paul.	Paulo.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
It doesn't seem too bad.	Nimis non videtur.
You.	Sit tibi.
which I can certainly understand.	quod certe intelligere possum.
He wanted his wife.	Voluit uxorem suam.
I owe everything I tried to do.	Debere conatus sum omnibus et facere.
Yes it is here.	Ita est hic.
and got it.	et obtinuit eam.
He was a man.	Erat vir.
I did not know.	Ego nesciebam.
In this way, please.	Hoc modo, quaeso.
It's not like anything else.	Non est simile aliud.
I hope all is well.	Spero omnes bene.
Me too.	Me quoque.
This is a great question.	Magna quaestio haec est.
And we.	Et nos.
He didn't want to do it.	Noluit id facere.
He buys it.	Emit eam.
There was another thing too.	Aliud quoque fuit.
Just doing your job.	Iustus officium tuum faciens.
He understood everything.	Intellexit omnia.
But it is one thing.	Sed aliud est.
You definitely don't want to be.	Certo non vis fieri tibi.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum est.
More is not always better.	Plus non semper melius.
We can do one this afternoon.	Possumus facere unum hoc post meridiem.
Your job is to do it for sure.	Tuum est certe id facere.
It's time to do something.	Aliquam nec aliquam est.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I know many things about her, but certainly not all.	Multa de illa scio, sed certe non omnia.
But it was not either.	Sed vel non erat.
He didn't want you to know.	Noluit te scire.
You can do this easily here.	Hoc facile hic facere potes.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
It's your name.	Est nomen.
And so on and on.	Et in et in.
That was good and bad.	Quod erat bonum et malum.
This is definitely a little fun.	Certo hic amet parum est.
I know you are.	Scio te esse.
The first one is easy.	Primum facile est.
Only one you are working on.	Solus unus es opus in.
Now I have a job.	Nunc habeo officium.
This is the same with us.	Hoc idem est apud nos.
How true it is.	Quam verum sit.
I'm here now.	Hic nunc sum.
I do not think.	non puto.
I don't know yet why this is necessary.	Nescio tamen cur hoc opus sit.
I hope the same.	Idem spero.
he did not say.	non dixit.
You don't.	Non facis.
No, not the same.	Non, non idem.
Everything was done to her too.	Nimium factum est ei omnia.
Arrived on time and got to work.	Venit ad tempus et ad opus obtinuit.
This was what she thought.	Hoc erat quod putavit.
It will do nothing for us.	Nihil nobis facturus est.
A lot of money is gone.	Multum pecuniae abiit.
You did it.	Fecisti.
Do as you want!	Fac sicut vis!
But also from there.	Sed et ex enim.
I don't think you are, you know.	Non puto te esse, scis.
I wanted to say something else.	aliud mihi dicere volui.
It is very well done.	Optime factum est.
I could not say for sure.	Pro certo dicere non potui.
You want your money.	Tua vis pecuniae est.
That's him himself.	Id ipsum eum.
This is as good as you are.	Tam bene hic habet quam tu.
I'm glad we did it.	Id nos fecisse gaudeo.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I really think something is wrong.	Ego vere cogitare aliquid mali est.
But you are right.	Sed tu recte.
I could not say enough.	Non potui satis dicere.
The dog has it.	Canis id habet.
I don't want to do this anymore.	Nolo hoc amplius facere.
That's what you're getting at.	Id quod apud vos questus es.
He was in the same order.	In ut ipsum erat.
That's what surprises me.	Id miror.
I believe.	Credo.
This was true, as far as we can tell.	Hoc verum erat, quantum possumus dicere.
I wanted to get married.	volui uxorem.
I really want this.	Hoc vere volo.
To-morrow as has been said.	Cras ut dictum est.
It does not please.	Non placet.
He does this very well.	Hoc optime facit.
That will be difficult.	Id difficile erit.
I'm pretty sure you're still doing it.	Satis certum habeo te etiam facere.
It was all done before me.	Totum ante me factum est.
This was so done.	Hoc ita factum est.
There is no one to help me.	Nemo est qui me adiuvet.
But there is no one.	Sed quis nulla est.
All these things are from us here.	Haec omnia a nobis hic sunt.
Well, he doesn't love me exactly.	Bene, non amat, prorsus.
really surprised to see you.	Miror te videre vere.
But that's only a great idea.	Sed id magna nisi.
So they are men.	Sic homines sunt.
What he could do.	Quod posset.
That's what's right now.	Ut quid nunc.
You are like a man, you are men.	Sicut homo es, homines sunt.
He has nothing to say.	Nihil dicere non habet.
Maybe that was him.	Aliquam id erat ipsum.
He knew that.	Sciebat.
Nothing was but true.	Nihil erat nisi verum.
I don't think or love me.	Non puto vel amat.
Very well.	Valde bene.
I will definitely say it again.	Certo iterum dicam.
Soon he could not even speak.	mox ne loqui quidem potuit.
Even if not.	Etiam non nisi.
He can remain.	Manere potest .
Which is not entirely true.	Quod non omnino verum est.
So perhaps that was done.	Ita fortasse id factum est.
Yes, why not.	Ita, cur non.
This was not the only time.	Hoc solum tempus non erat.
That's because it's so easy.	Id quod tam facile.
But it is.	Sed sit.
i know more than you.	plus scio quam tu.
You are lucky.	Felix es.
He saw me.	Vidit me.
He was not a man.	Homo non erat.
Maybe not never.	Aliquam non numquam.
i never thought it would be you.	numquam putavi fore te.
but better	sed melius.
Not really.	Non vere.
However, he was not sure.	Tamen non erat certus.
There is probably more.	Plus est probabiliter.
I guess he had never been there.	Suspicor eum nunquam ibi fuisse.
But his teacher comes after you.	Sed post te venit magister eius.
It has been late.	Nuper non fuit.
Perhaps nothing is to be done at this time.	Nihil fortasse hoc tempore faciendum est.
See you there.	Vide ibi te.
It is not certain.	Certum non est.
You do this yourself? 	Hoc tu ipse facis ?
There was no one here.	Hic non erat quis.
I have nothing to give.	dare nihil habeo.
But that was before.	Sed id erat ante.
That was the same thing.	Id ipsum erat.
perhaps a little before.	fortasse paulo ante.
It is before him.	Est ante ipsum.
Good for your dog.	Bene canem tuum.
I know what you are thinking.	Scio quid cogitas.
There is no such thing.	Nulla id ipsum est.
I've never seen her do it with anyone.	Nunquam vidi eam facere cum aliquo.
Say what you want to know.	Dicam quid vis scire.
So it is.	Ita est.
But she said nothing.	Illa tamen nihil dixit.
It is getting late.	Is nuper questus est.
Yes that's nice.	Etiam id nisi.
This has been done.	Hoc factum est.
This is my job.	Meum est officium.
This one is for me.	Hoc unum pro me est.
Maybe it was too.	Aliquam erat etiam.
To see it	Videre eam .
It's not going to be easy.	Non facile futurum est.
Someone behind me.	Post me aliquis.
He soon followed.	Mox ille.
But not only to speak.	Sed non solum loqui.
She's really happy!	Illa vere felix!.
And now I will say something.	Et modo aliquid dicam.
I need to get to the point.	Opus est ut ad rem.
But it is not necessary.	Sed non est necesse.
Tomorrow that's how.	Cras id quam.
I don't like you.	Non placet tibi.
This morning was easy.	Hoc mane facile fuit.
Go to school and class.	Ad scholam et genus.
Take a look at this.	Vide ut hoc.
It was so.	Ita erat.
Plan your lunch ahead of time.	Cogitas te prandium ante tempus.
I have never been.	Numquam fui.
He knew not to be.	Scivit non esse.
And they are good.	Et bona sunt.
It was too late to stop.	Sero erat prohibere.
I am so happy that we are.	Tam felix sum ut sumus.
That's how important it is.	Ut sit amet est quam.
Tell me where you look.	Dic ubi vide.
Let no one help me.	Nemo me adiuvet.
That's where it was done.	Id ubi factum est.
Not sure of that.	Nec id certo.
Everything is there.	Omnia ibi.
You cannot do so.	Sic facere non potes.
No, never again.	Non, numquam iterum.
There is no need for this.	Nihil de hoc opus est.
I don't see much.	Non multum video.
Never want anything else.	Nunquam aliud vis.
Only one man did this.	Solus unus homo hoc fecit.
I am the only person at home.	Solus homo sum domi.
to do all this.	id totum facere.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
He can have it.	Habere potest.
He had a job to do and did it.	Habuit officium facere et fecit.
I'll tell you better.	Melius dicam.
He is gone for you.	Abiit tibi.
I don't know what to do next.	Nescio quid faciendum.
But it was evil.	Sed malum esset.
But also there.	Sed et ibi.
But I don't really want to do this.	Sed hoc facere non vere volo.
It is important for the employees.	Aliquam sit amet enim velit.
When you have a question, we have a question.	Cum tibi quaestio, habemus quaestio.
Boy, do you think that would be easy.	Puer, id facile fore putas.
But this boy	Sed hic puer .
Yes, okay.	Ita, bene.
I haven't seen you for a long time.	Non te diu.
We can do well.	Bene possumus.
If this were true.	Quod si verum esset.
There was no time to explain why.	Tempus non erat cur.
This is never forgotten.	Hoc numquam oblitus est.
But that's how it is.	Sed id quam ipsum.
He loves something he has in himself.	Aliquid habet in se amat.
Even if you can.	Etiam si potes.
You have everything.	Habes omnia.
Everyone just kind of knows.	Omnes iustus genus scit.
Or, you know.	Vel, scis.
He now knows what will happen, and knows that he wants it.	Nunc novit quid futurum sit, et se id velle novit.
And now he's gone, he's gone enough.	Et nunc abiit, satis abiit.
I think pretty well.	Puto satis bene.
There is no need to do this right now.	De hoc nunc non est opus.
Nothing is like it at all.	Nihil est omnino simile.
But no longer from me.	Sed iam non ex me.
He does not know, however.	Nescit, sed.
I know what's going to happen there.	Scio quid ibi futurum sit.
You plan to do something.	Aliquid facere cogitas.
The same can be true for you.	Idem tibi verum esse potest.
He knew that he was not.	Scivit se non esse.
And it was.	Erat autem.
It was something that I was lucky.	Aliquid fuit quod felix fuit.
Well.	Bene.
I thought.	Cogitavi.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
You can't get it.	Non potes accipere.
It's from.	Est ex.
How is this?	Quomodo hoc?
It's hard to know.	Difficile est scio.
Was.	Erat.
I don't know what to do.	Nescio quid facias.
He left this morning.	Hoc mane reliquit.
It was for you.	Erat tibi.
Unable to go.	Posset ire.
Don't be like mine, don't be like yours.	Non sit sicut meum, non sit sicut tuum.
Maybe that's how.	Aliquam id quam.
But neither was he before.	Sed nec ante erat.
His name.	Nomen eius.
I wonder about that.	Miror de illo.
She didn't want to play with me.	Ludere mecum illa noluit.
This one is here.	Hic hic unus est.
We can't do this job.	Hoc officium non possumus facere.
Most likely you won't do it.	Verisimile non faciam.
But it does not have it.	Sed sic non habet.
His decision was not made.	Eius consilium non est factum.
Not in that way.	Non eo modo.
I wonder what his name will be.	Miror quid nomen eius futurum sit.
He could do nothing.	Nihil potuit.
He just got it.	Qui mox obtinuit.
Nothing is gonna be nothing.	Nulla sit amet nulla nisi.
But one thing seems probable.	Sed unum videtur probabile.
Nothing has ever been said.	Nulla semper dictum est.
I could not think of this now.	Hoc nunc cogitare non potuit.
No no no.	Nulla non nulla.
What you don't want to see.	Quod videre non vis.
I said too much, and too soon.	Nimium dixi, et nimium cito.
I just want your help.	Ego iustus volo tibi auxilium.
And it was late.	Et sero factum est.
But that's out now.	Sed id nunc ex.
Look here, see.	Vide hic vide.
It was too much to go through.	Nimis erat ut in.
But not always.	Sed non semper.
he came early.	mane venit.
I just don't see that.	Ego iustus non video esse.
But you are right.	Sed tu recte.
But he is also now.	Sed et ipsum nunc.
I don't like you.	Non placet tibi.
Good job we're here.	Bonum officium est hic sumus.
Look soon.	Vide mox.
Nothing could stop us.	Nihil nos prohibere potuit.
I am not going to do this with you.	Non sum facturus hoc apud te.
But it is not necessary.	Sed non est necesse.
However,.	Autem,.
He came into my room a lot.	Multum in cubiculum meum venit.
I don't think you know me.	Non puto te scire me.
If he	Si ille.
No almost none.	Nulla fere nulla.
It was like yesterday for me.	Erat heri similis mihi.
Not all yet.	Non omnes tamen.
I do not know.	Non scio.
You can buy something there.	Ibi aliquid emere potes.
Something and indeed and.	Aliquid et quidem et.
That looks pretty good.	Quod satis spectat bonum.
It's wrong only.	Mali tantum.
It's better not to.	Melius est ut non.
I know you're doing it.	Scio te id facere.
Better yet.	Melius, sed.
No one wants to be honest.	Nulla sit amet enim velit.
It looked better.	Melius videbatur.
There was no one who was none.	Nulla quis nulla erat.
I hope all is well.	Spero bene.
Who is it rather than who it is.	Eum, qui eam quam quis.
The boy looks so much.	Puer tantum spectat.
He was ready for everything.	Erat paratus ad omnia.
Thus he was.	Sic ille fuit.
This would be good for him.	Hoc bonum sibi esset.
We are all out of a job.	Quod nos omnes ex a officium.
I wasn't sure that.	Quod certe non eram.
You don't have a lot of time.	Et non multum tempus est.
You don't have to do this.	Noli tibi hoc facere.
This school has not been.	Haec schola non fuit.
This much and much more.	Hoc multo et amplius.
He wants to do it.	Facere qui velit.
And I said to him, and he asked for my name.	Et dixi ei, et nomen meum quaesivit.
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
That will be tomorrow.	Id cras erit.
Don't go to business.	Noli ad rem ire.
And perhaps not.	Et fortasse non.
You're sorry.	Tecum nimium paenitet.
That's the work.	Sibi opus esse.
It seems so.	Ita videtur.
See what he has.	Vide quid habet.
if ever.	si umquam.
He thought maybe he could do it.	Putavit fortasse facere posse.
It is not so.	Non est ita.
perhaps he is still alive.	fortasse adhuc est.
You all.	Vos omnes.
Maybe he can barely do anything else than accept it.	Forsitan vix potest aliud facere quam accipere .
But that's what my teacher told me to do.	Sed id quod magister meus mihi dixit facere.
he said that he did not know.	dixit se nescire.
But not the time itself.	Sed non tempus ipsum.
But he did not think so.	Sed non ita putabat.
I wanted to do this now.	hoc nunc facere volui.
She speaks a lot.	Multum illa loquitur.
Now I can swim.	Nunc natare potest.
I need something to do with it.	Mihi opus est facere aliquid cum illo.
But not for him.	Sed nec ipsum enim.
That's enough what you know.	Hoc satis est quod scis.
She knows only one thing.	Una illa scit.
But perhaps it is not.	Sed fortasse non est.
It would not be possible without you.	Sine te fieri non potest.
He also doesn't want to choose.	Etiam non velit velit.
The man was a dog.	Vir canis erat.
He wanted me.	Voluit me.
I want to see it so much.	Et vis videre eam tam.
But that's how it is.	Sed id quantum est.
He could not.	Non potuit.
He said nothing.	nihil dixit.
From you.	Ex te.
I heard nothing else.	Nihil aliud audivi.
He can't stay here.	Hic manere non potest.
it is not certain.	non est certum.
that is who we are.	id est qui sumus.
But that was said from.	Sed id dictum ex.
You have one.	Tibi unum.
Maybe not.	Aliquam non.
He's going to do it.	Facturum est.
He wanted to play.	Ludere voluit.
I am very surprised, but they are still alive.	Valde miror, sed adhuc sunt.
Do the best you can.	Fac optime potes.
he says.	dicit.
That's how it's done.	Id quomodo factum est.
To be there is nothing to do with Him.	Esse sit nihil ad ipsum.
That seems good.	Quod bonum videtur.
Certainly he does not know.	Certe non novit.
He was not ready for the day.	Non erat paratus ad diem.
One, he did not see me.	Unum, non me vidit.
Maybe she did it for him.	Fortasse fecit sibi.
Certainly he said.	Certe dixit.
I know exactly what happened.	Novi prorsus quid acciderit.
it will be good for me.	bonum mihi erit.
He didn't want you to know.	Noluit te scire.
Get what you want.	Id quod vis.
which I have done well.	quod bene feci.
He does not know.	Nescit.
You can do what is yours.	Facere potes quod tuum est.
That's none of the same.	Ut id ipsum nulla.
How!	Quomodo!.
By and by.	Per et per.
This is not good enough.	Hoc non satis bene.
but he started us.	sed ipse nos incepit.
That's the way it should be.	Id modo debet.
I can't help it.	Videri non possum auxilio.
No more than that.	Nulla id quam.
I see nothing new here.	Nihil novi hic video.
What I'm looking for in this post	Quae me ad hanc post- .
But that's great.	Sed id magna.
That's your job now.	Quod nunc tuum est officium.
I want to help you, now you know us.	Te adiuvare volo, nunc scis inter nos.
If we can do good, we can do evil.	Si bonum possumus, malum facere possumus.
And here it is.	Et hic est.
Wait again.	Mane iterum.
Or he wants to do so.	Vel velit id.
I didn't think so.	Non putabam.
I was not good.	Non bonus eram.
This is perhaps.	Hoc est fortasse.
And the dog, if it were one.	Et canis, si una esset.
.	.
I have a house.	Habeo domum.
But you're getting along.	Sed per questus es.
He has not now, but soon.	Non habet nunc, sed cito.
He was a dog.	Canis erat.
I'm for that.	Im pro quam.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
That's always a plus.	Id semper plus.
I don't know what to say about him.	Nescio quidem quid de illo dicam.
I'm glad that I know you are.	Gaudeo quod novi sunt.
You know what you're here.	Scis quid hic sis.
There's nothing in it.	Nulla in.
And yes, I'm a guy.	Et sic, guy est me.
It could not be done, he said.	Fieri non potuit, dixit.
Unless we're late.	Nisi sero sumus.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
Not yet sure.	Nondum certe.
Something more for me.	Plus aliquid me.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
Do this to me.	Hoc mihi fac.
Now I have you.	Nunc te habeo.
I know why you're here.	Scio cur hic sis.
I definitely feel for you.	Pro certo sentio tibi.
But he has no time now.	Sed tempus nunc non habet.
My husband is gone.	Vir meus abiit.
I didn't think so.	Non putabam esse.
That's hard to think about.	Quod difficile est cogitare de.
Yes, that was not good.	Etiam non erat quam.
Great here.	Magna hic.
It could have been there for years.	Annos ibi esse potuit.
Really I can't.	Vere non possum.
I don't talk much.	Non multum loqui.
What is your name?	Quid tibi nomen est?
And boy, does the work.	Et puer, opus facit.
Now is the time to think about it.	Nunc tempus id ipsum ut videtur.
This he did nothing.	Hoc nihil fecit.
Yes, perhaps it is.	Etiam fortasse est.
Take a look at the time	Vide tempore.
Or not.	Vel non.
But he was not like him.	Sed non erat ut ipsum.
He knows this.	Scit hoc.
Now it is ready.	Modo sit paratus.
It was pretty good.	Erat satis.
We're here to help.	Ad auxilium hic sumus.
I don't know how, but it was good.	Nescio quomodo, sed bene fuit.
Please, I hope this is work for you.	Quaeso, id spero, hoc opus est tibi.
I want to see him.	Volo videre eum.
It does not please.	Non placet.
It was said to be done quickly.	Dictum factum quam cito.
The situation is not so.	Non ita se res habet.
None in this article.	Nulla in dictum ipsum.
I don't see why you do it.	Non video cur id facias.
Not all good things.	Non omnia bona.
We can't talk about it.	Non possumus loqui de illo.
Even not to him.	Etiam nec ipsum.
I was not her.	Non eram eius.
But what has been said?	Sed quis dictum est.
I make more money than I do.	Plus pecuniae facio quam facit.
I felt better for sure.	Melius certe habui.
To anyone.	Ut quis.
It was too late for work.	Sero opus erat.
Thus was that day.	Sic erat ille dies.
Unless you have nothing.	Nisi nihil habes.
What is it? 	Quid est hoc?
What's it like?	Simile quid?
It was not a plan.	Non erat consilium.
That is more than money.	Id est quam pecuniam.
This is the text.	Hoc est illud.
No one did it before.	Nemo id ante.
But who is to see?	Sed quis videre est.
if this has been done.	si id factum est.
It used to be.	Solebat esse.
I believe she loves me too.	Me quoque credo amat.
I can do nothing about this.	De hoc nihil possum facere.
His name is.	Eius nomen est.
He told me a lot about him.	Ipse mihi de se multum dixit.
Good man.	Vir bonus.
Which seems very unlikely.	Quod valde probabile videtur.
But it was not before.	Sed non ante erat.
You mean well.	Vis bene.
The boy doesn't want to.	Puer non vult.
He can swim.	Natare potest.
So also yours.	Sic et tuum.
It was said in the above.	Dictum in est.
It was scarcely possible.	Vix erat.
Maybe it's time to save.	Aliquam id tempus nisi.
That's my boy.	Ut 'Puer meus.
Deal quickly, got it! 	Fac cito, obtinuit!
First off, this will never be so.	Primum, numquam hoc ita esse.
It does not please.	Non placet.
You know what I mean.	Scis quid sit.
I am sure you will be soon.	Certus sum te cito esse.
It's not bad.	Malum non est.
There is no time for it.	Nulla id tempus ipsum.
Who really knows.	Quis vere scit.
To be very happy.	Ut sit amet ipsum.
He did not come home.	Non venit domum.
He came early.	Mane venit.
Well, it was fine.	Bene, bene erat.
We are not like today.	Non sumus sicut hodie.
i'm just yet.	Im 'modo tamen.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
That's not what occurred to me.	Id mihi non occurrit.
He was well.	Bene erat.
If anyone can, he can.	Si quis potest, ille potest.
You can find them all here.	Hic potes omnia invenire.
You kind of know who you want to be.	Tu genus scis qui vis.
I thought I would do it this way.	Putavi hoc modo facturum esse.
Who did it tonight.	Qui hac nocte fecit.
I didn't know what to do.	nesciebam quid facerem.
Truly, I truly believe.	Vere, vere credo.
It is not a matter.	Non rem.
That certainly seems to me.	Id mihi certe videtur.
He was not a man.	Non erat homo.
Now I can't do it.	Nunc facere non possum.
He seems to have done that.	Quod fecisse videtur.
You can't speak.	Non potes dicere.
and it is your name.	et est nomen tuum.
There is no one to love him.	Nulla quis ipsum.
No one will ever love him.	Nulla quis semper ipsum.
You can't stay.	Manere non potes.
It was not a plan.	Non erat consilium.
I don't know how.	Nescio quomodo.
But there is a lot to be done.	Sed multum faciendum est.
But not here.	Sed hic non.
Certainly there is no man like this.	Certe non est homo sic.
Who knows how to play? 	Quis scit ludere?
Happy, no it's not.	Felix, nulla non est.
No, but yet.	Non, sed tamen.
Yes to you.	Ita ut te.
Now you have everything.	Nunc omnia habes.
But there was something.	Aliquid erat, sed.
Yes, that's what I said.	Etiam id dictum quam.
More time than what we have.	Plus tempus quam id quod habemus.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
It is good.	Bonum est.
He doesn't seem to understand.	Non videtur intelligere.
It seems to me both.	Utrumque mihi videtur.
Good, good, that, good.	Bonum, bonum, hoc, bonum.
I never get any now.	Numquam aliquam nunc.
It was just too much of it.	Nimis erat iustus ex eo.
A lot.	Sit amet.
I really can't stop.	Ego vere potest non prohibere.
Which indeed it was not.	Quod quidem non esset.
Well, I was there.	Bene, ibi eram.
Isn't everything okay?	Nonne omnia bene?
I plan to come and live there one day.	Cogitavi venire et ibi unum diem vivere'.
Not what he wants now.	Non quod nunc illum velit.
Yes, it is not.	Etiam non est enim.
Not much, but something.	Non multum, sed aliquid.
We have a lot to do.	Multum habemus facere.
But for, except by what means.	Sed enim, nisi quo id.
That day was great for us.	Multum nobis illo die fuit.
It is not for him.	Non quod sibi.
He thought.	Putabat.
stop me from him.	ei me prohibere.
This year I did.	Hoc anno feci.
Is this help?	An hoc auxilium?.
I had and asked if there was a need.	Non habuit et quaesivit si opus esset.
Maybe everything.	Forsitan omnia.
This is not mine.	Hoc non est meum.
That which was made, that was made.	Quod factum est quod factum est.
I think that's right now.	Puto id, nunc.
Please think about this.	Placet hoc cogitare.
The day has come.	dies venit.
We can never talk about this before.	Numquam ante hanc loqui de aliquo possumus.
Well indeed anything.	Bene quidem quicquam.
This will be my business.	Haec mea res erit.
No one is there.	Nulla quis est.
If not, it's too late to do something.	Si non est, sero est ad aliquid faciendum.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
No you want to buy.	Nulla vis emere.
I don't want to see someone.	Nolo aliquem videre.
Not here, not from her.	Non hic, non ab illa.
and they are men.	et homines sunt.
Don't talk much.	Nec multum loqui.
I need to be there for me.	Mihi opus est ut ibi sit mihi.
It's not hard to do.	Non est difficile facere.
This was him.	Hic erat eum.
This is not true.	Non hoc est.
No, so it was done.	Non, sic factum est.
You're right about me.	Recte de me es.
But this is not possible.	Sed hoc fieri non potest.
I still am not good enough.	Ego adhuc non sum satis.
You, however.	Tu tamen.
Maybe something from me.	Fortasse aliquid a me.
And you have help.	Et habes auxilium.
What does he say?	Quid dicit?
But that is how.	Sed ut est quam.
It would be something.	Esset aliquid.
I know what I'm willing to say.	Scio quid me velit dicere.
I never have one.	Numquam enim unum.
I'm glad to be here.	Gaudeo eum hic esse.
Yes, and it was before.	Etiam et ante erat.
But you can't imagine what it is like.	Sed non potes cogitare quid simile sit.
It is the same.	Simile est hoc.
Can you hear us?	Putasne nos audire posse?
For who was in it.	In quis erat enim.
It was pretty bad.	Satis erat malum.
It is morning.	Mane est.
Now it is not.	Iam non est.
I didn't think.	Non putavi.
It was not enough.	Parum erat.
But not now.	Sed non nunc.
Too often now.	Nimis saepe modo.
It was yours.	Tuum erat.
nothing nothing.	Nihil nihil.
I just didn't know.	Modo nesciebam.
This is	Hoc est.
Don't.	Noli.
We can't stay here.	Non possumus hic manere.
We again.	Nos iterum.
This is something that used to be done.	Hoc est aliquid quod fieri non solebat.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I love it.	Illud amo.
You can do this for me.	Hoc facere potes mihi.
I don't have more money.	Non plus pecuniae.
No, but always yourself.	Nulla sed semper ipsum.
We are here.	Hic sumus.
Not much today.	Non multum hodie.
It's his business.	Eius res est.
But not now, man.	Sed non iam, homo.
He never wanted this.	Hoc numquam voluit.
Not so yet.	Non ita tamen.
but it was not difficult.	nec tamen difficile fuit.
Things you don't want to hear about us.	Quae non vis audire de nobis.
At length he did it.	Tandem fecit.
I just can't talk.	Modo non possum dicere.
It is certainly difficult for me.	Mihi certe difficile est.
How hard it is.	Quam difficile id sit.
But that's not enough.	Sed id non satis.
No one is evil.	Nemo malum.
Not even the boy left me.	Ne me quidem puer reliquit.
I have a long time ago.	Habeo diu ante diem.
i'll never be there again.	ut numquam ibi iterum.
He did all things for himself.	Omnia pro se fecit.
There is someone out there who can help you.	Est aliquis ex ibi qui te adiuvet.
I've seen this.	Hoc ego vidi.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
Tell me.	Dic mecum.
It is, but not from.	Est, sed non ex.
Good to have you this morning.	Bene habere tibi hanc mane.
Maybe too much.	Nimium fortasse.
I don't know whether this is true.	Nescio an hoc verum sit.
To help us.	Adiuvare nos.
He truly and truly loves me.	Vere et vere me amat.
which I am very glad.	quod valde gaudeo.
You don't plan to do it, but you think.	Non cogitas te facere, sed cogitas.
That is.	Quod est.
I don't.	Non facio.
Which way it was done.	Quod ita factum est.
Take some time for yourself.	Aliquam id tempus ipsum.
And it is right in him.	Et recte est in eo.
But neither was it said.	Sed nec dictum est.
It was certain.	Certum erat.
That is not quite true.	Quod non est satis verum.
I can't do it.	Non possum enim.
It seems pretty easy.	Satis facile videtur.
He does not think that it could be done, but it was.	Non putat fieri posse, sed fuit.
You have friends who.	Habes amicos, qui.
There is still work.	Adhuc opus est.
He was very lonely.	Solus valde erat.
so i'll do it for me one day.	ut mihi unum faciam diem.
This he left.	Hoc reliquit.
Now who it was.	Nunc quis erat.
Lately.	Nuper.
So also here.	Ita etiam hic.
She doesn't seem to have much.	Illa videtur non multum habere.
That's how he wants to think about himself.	Id quomodo de se cogitare velit.
I was alone.	solus eram.
Get more money.	Plus pecuniae.
I did everything I could.	Feci omnia posse.
All right, man.	Recte, homo.
Now get out.	Nunc ut ex.
I know we can do it.	Scio nos id facere posse.
That was nothing.	Nihil erat id.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
All is well.	Omnia bene.
What I have done.	Quod feci.
It will be very close.	Proxima erit.
You don't have anything to do.	Non habes aliquid facere.
I can't give it now.	Nunc dare non possum.
You cannot be all things to all.	Non potes omnibus esse omnia.
It was time for me to be on my own.	Tempus erat me esse in mea.
This is true.	Hoc verum est.
No one said to him that he should do this.	Nemo ei dixit ut hoc faceret.
You can't win alone.	Te solum vincere non potes.
There was nothing to say among us.	Nihil erat inter nos dicere.
Trying very well.	Optime conatur.
I know nothing more.	Nihil novi amplius.
Three men.	Tres homines.
This is gonna be fun.	Haec amet amet.
It is he.	Est ille.
And he was alone.	Erat autem solus.
I believe you are totally wrong.	Prorsus credo te esse malum.
I probably didn't want to know.	Ego probabiliter scire noluit.
It could not have been done.	Fieri non potuit .
He has always forgotten his name.	Semper est nomen eius oblitus.
But who was right?	Sed quis erat, recte.
He has forgotten us.	Oblitus est nos.
And got along well with him.	Et bene cum eo obtinuit.
Do you know what?	An id scis.
But there is one thing.	Unum tamen est.
It's kind of like you.	Genus tibi simile est.
He is just a boy after all.	Puer iustus est post omnes.
I don't feel this way anymore.	Sic iam non sentio.
So not enough time now.	Ita non satis temporis nunc.
We have a good time traveling.	Simul bene iter habemus.
But there was something.	Erat aliquid sed.
Thus it was done.	Sic factum est.
Well indeed his job is.	Bene quidem eius officium est.
He knows it.	Novit eam.
Not me anymore.	Non me iam.
He says it is time.	Dicit tempus est.
I want to hear what it was, not what not.	audire volo quid esset, non quid non.
I guess you've been there.	Suspicor te ibi fuisse.
Maybe you haven't said it before.	Aliquam non dictum ante.
It is the same with you.	Idem esse tecum.
I like it.	Mihi sic placet.
I don't need it.	Mihi non opus est.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
This is possible.	Hoc fieri potest.
Maybe even before.	Aliquam vel ante.
It was a great question.	Magna quaestio erat.
We can't live together.	Non possumus simul vivere.
Or is it so?	An ita est.
There is no such thing.	Nulla id ipsum est.
you never know why.	numquam cur.
And it was done.	Et factum est.
But it is.	Sed est.
It's not so bad.	Non ita malum est.
There I can help you.	Ibi possum tibi.
I know you.	Novi te.
Something is not working.	Aliquid non est opus.
He knew this.	Hoc scivit.
But this is not likely to think.	Sed hoc verisimile non est cogitare.
Someone did, that is for sure.	Fecit aliquis, hoc est certe.
That would be one thing.	Quod esset unum.
As if not the same only, but as nothing.	Ut non ipsum nisi, sed ut nisi.
But that is not the case.	Sed id ipsum non est.
I see this happening.	Hoc video fieri.
He probably did.	Probabiliter fecit.
You	Tu .
He will be home tomorrow night.	Cras nocte domi erit.
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla nisi.
But he was unwilling to listen to his advice.	Sed consilium audire nolebat.
but you know what happened.	sed scis quid factum sit.
And it should not go well.	Et bene non debet.
Not even for dinner.	Ne ad cenam quidem.
You are doing well.	Bene facis.
He does well for himself.	Sibi bene facit.
You have always been good.	Semper tibi bene fuit.
He said both of them to be.	Dixit utrumque esse.
Even the dog.	Etiam canis.
This is actually really bad.	Hoc vere etiam malum est.
He wants to come home.	Domum suam venire vult.
Do it again today.	Adhuc hodie fac.
She has been there for a year now.	Ibi iam anno illa fuit.
I guess that's for another time.	Suspicor id in aliud tempus.
He could not.	Non potuit.
i'm enough.	satis sum.
But I don't have time for it.	Sed non tempus enim.
You don't mean what you want.	Non tibi vult quod vis tibi.
It was to be done.	Erat faciendum.
Perhaps you're ready, perhaps you're not.	Forsitan paratus sis, fortasse non es.
Maybe now was the time.	Fortasse nunc erat tempus.
He could not stay with us.	Nobiscum manere potuit.
You need to do this.	Debes hoc facere.
It was a great time for me.	Tempus erat magna mihi.
But this seems to me.	Sed hoc mihi videtur.
This too.	Hoc quoque.
Now it's up to one.	Nunc ad unum est.
On any of this.	De aliquo hoc.
It's pretty good.	Satis est bonum.
This is very good.	Is est valde bonus.
I have many things.	Habeo multa.
He could not.	Non potuit.
Yes that's none other than that.	Etiam id quam nulla.
said a little to me.	parum dixit ad me.
But that's not the only way.	Sed id non nisi.
Exactly like each other.	Prorsus sicut inter se.
It will not be so among you.	Non ita erit inter vos.
There is no one who will do it for you.	Nemo est qui tibi facturus sit.
I just knew it.	Modo scivi.
He can't do this.	Hoc facere non potest.
He looked after you.	Vidit post te.
Maybe say something.	Forsitan aliquid dicere.
Right, he did it.	Recte, fecit.
And it was late in the year.	Et factum est sero in anno.
It's not going to happen anymore.	Futurum non est amplius.
We deal with him.	Nos agere cum eo.
But he was not here.	Sed non erat hic.
What is, and man?	Quid est, et homo?
It is better.	Melius est.
Well she did it.	Bene id fecit.
He didn't want it.	Noluit eam.
There is no such thing as before.	Nulla id ipsum ante.
There's nothing wrong with that.	Non quod mali quicquam est.
Tell me what you had.	Dic mihi quod habuit.
I haven't said anything.	Non dictum, aliquam.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
I don't believe it.	Id non credo.
He was with us.	Cum erat nobis.
He is a good dog.	Canis bonus est.
I said it was mine.	Meum esse dixi.
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla nisi.
I have work to do.	Habeo opus facere.
He was not quite sure what he wanted to do.	Non satis certus erat quid facere vellet.
Something important, though.	Aliquid in magna, sed.
But that's not the only time.	Sed id tempus non nisi.
I know what my problem is.	Scio quid mihi sit quaestio.
But he gave another name.	Sed aliud nomen dedit.
He came.	Is venit.
That's easy when I'm right.	Quod cum facile recte facerem.
Now for another.	Iam aliud.
I believe you.	credo tibi.
I have done so.	Feci ita.
This is nothing for me now.	Hic nunc mihi nihil est.
What he knew.	Quod sciebat.
I was good to you.	bonus eram tibi.
I never met.	Numquam occurrit.
It could be true.	Posset esse verum.
This is yours now.	Hoc nunc tuum est.
I think that's great.	Puto quod magna est.
That kind of thing.	Id genus.
He did not leave his name.	Nomen suum non reliquit.
It was very early.	Erat valde mane.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
Let me help you.	Me auxilium vobis.
It will be again.	Sic iterum erit.
you can never but never say.	numquam tamen numquam potes dicere.
that's the kind I've seen before.	quod genus ante vidi.
If it is, you already have money.	Si sit, iam pecuniam.
We can't do it anymore.	Non possumus facere amplius.
Don't stay there.	Noli ibi manere.
I'd like to see that.	Quod videre libet.
I don't know what's happened now.	Nescio quid nunc acciderit.
And you can have it.	Et habere potes.
It's something you might like to know.	Est quod fortasse scire debes.
I can't thank you enough for this.	Non possum tibi satis pro hoc agere.
They are with me.	Mecum sunt.
No father can tell him what to do.	Nemo pater ei dicere potest quid faciendum sit.
Too much to do.	Nimium facere.
You want to stay there.	Vis ibi manere.
You can believe.	Credere potes.
I just did it.	Ego iustus feci eum.
You ought to be very lonely.	Valde te solum esse debes.
with each other.	Cum inter se.
I need advice.	consilium mihi opus est.
They are never quick enough.	Numquam satis cito sunt.
I must stay here.	hic manere debeo.
But it is not that.	Sed non est id.
In order to love yourself.	In ut ipsum quam.
You make me be.	Tu fac me esse.
And he saw something more.	Et vidit aliquid amplius.
That was the same thing.	Id ipsum erat.
That's what it is.	Ut id est est.
I think this is a real and good decision.	Hoc puto esse verum et bonum consilium.
It was not a day.	Non erat dies.
I can do nothing.	nihil possum facere.
That he says something.	Quod aliquid dicit.
I want something else.	Aliud volo.
Yes that is great.	Etiam id magna est.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
They're still there.	Sunt adhuc ibi.
That makes you hard.	Quod difficile te facit.
I've thought a lot about this.	Ego multum de hoc cogitavi.
There is more to do.	Plus est facere.
You can think of what this trip is like.	Cogitare potes quid hoc iter simile sit.
But it was time for some.	Aliquam sed tempus erat.
But it is not true.	Sed non est verum.
And it is indeed.	Et est quidem.
Lunch is not for you. 	Prandium non est tibi. 
he knew he was there.	sciebat ibi fuisse.
For us.	Nobis.
I don't think so.	Non puto ita esse.
That was not the plan.	Non erat id consilium.
He is not gone now.	Non nunc abiit.
Not for everyone.	Non pro omnibus.
Only the first floor.	Solum primum solum.
It was hard.	Difficile erat.
Maybe a little.	Fortasse paulo.
So it is.	Ita est.
He saw men.	Vidit homines.
You need to act quickly.	Debes cito agere.
I knew better than to talk in school, though.	Melius scivi quam in schola loqui, sed.
This what is, is nothing.	Hoc quid est, nihil est.
He can do nothing for us.	Nihil nobis facere potest.
Yes, some.	Etiam aliquam.
So still.	Sic adhuc.
So he saw me.	Ita me vidit.
All right, if it were so.	Recte, si ita esset.
This is what I like.	Hic est quod placet.
He should not.	Non debet.
I myself have done it.	Ego ipse feci.
It's okay to be late here.	Sero hic bene est.
But now he knew that it was not true.	Sed nunc sciebat quod verum non erat.
It is important to know when to give assistance.	Aliquam sit amet scire quando auxilium dare.
It is certain.	Certum est.
If he has anything.	Si quid habet.
It's going to happen to us.	Ad nos futurum est.
That is to help us.	Id est, ut nos adiuvet.
What is.	Quid est.
Look at yourself.	Vide te ipsum.
But now it's yours.	Sed nunc tuum est.
Yes, good man.	Ita, vir bonus.
To.	Ad.
Never get sick.	Numquam male.
Another thing is that you can't say it again.	Aliud est quod iterum dicere non potes.
He saw me for sure.	Vidit me certe.
I can't come to you.	Non potest ad te venire.
but we have better.	sed melius habemus.
I'm not sure.	Non me certe.
Well, enough about me.	Bene, de me satis.
or for me.	vel pro me.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
You can truly see everything.	Vere videre potes omnia.
It's not too good.	Non est nimium bonum.
But as was said.	Sed ut dictum erat.
That's a very good question.	Quod ipsum bonum quaestio est.
No but only save.	Nulla sed nisi nisi.
I have yet one.	Adhuc unum habeo.
He is alone there.	Solus ibi est.
I do not know.	nescio.
He knows it too.	Novit quoque.
No not now.	Nulla non nunc.
What I can't.	Quod non possum.
When was it?	Quando erat?
he did it too.	fecit etiam.
Your job is to know where you are.	Tuum est scire ubi sis.
Maybe it was time.	Aliquam id tempus erat.
therefore we can understand.	quare possumus intelligere.
We don't like it.	Non placet nobis.
You are not my father.	Non pater.
See that he is happy.	Vide quod sit felix.
To play.	Ludere.
They are not.	Non sunt.
You don't have this right now.	Hoc nunc non habes.
But I am still helping.	Sed adhuc auxilio sum.
Tell them to do it.	Dic ut facias.
It's all about to win.	Est omnibus vincere.
I tried to talk but couldn't.	Conatus est loqui sed non potuit.
Look at the thirty.	Vide in triginta.
I think it is a good one.	Puto esse unum bonum.
That's gonna be great.	Ut sit amet magna.
We already have more than one.	Iam plus quam unum habemus.
He told her that he wanted everything from her.	Dixit ei se omnia ex illa velle.
Which is true.	Quod verum est.
This is not easy.	Hoc non est facile.
And indeed it was not true.	Et quidem non erat verum.
You can't see in it.	Non potes videre in illo.
I never heard of him again.	numquam ab eo iterum audivi.
There is better.	Ibi melius est.
I like your book, though.	Librum tuum mihi placet, sed.
He has a plan.	Habet consilium.
The thing is so.	Res ita est.
I love you.	Amo te.
Maybe we're already.	Fortasse iam sumus.
But I have one.	Sed unum habeo.
And perhaps it is not necessary.	Et fortasse necesse non est.
That's where.	Id 'ubi'.
I need to think about something else.	Opus est aliud cogitare.
You are not very good.	Non es valde bonus.
At last it is certain.	Tandem certum est.
That's what you can do.	Id quod facere potes.
He would not listen.	Noluit audire.
I know that it was so done, that it was so done.	scio quod ita factum est ut ita factum sit.
But, as stated above.	Sed, ut dictum est.
I am doing my best.	Ego facio meum.
I can still play.	Ludere adhuc possum.
Tomorrow it will take some time.	Cras id aliquam enim.
It is not about me.	Non de me.
I respect her a lot.	Vereor eam multum.
This is so.	Hoc ita est.
To sit.	Ut sit.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
You can't have both.	Utrumque habere non potes.
He didn't like a lot of things.	Nolebat multum.
He loves and loves me.	Ipse amat, et me amat.
Now he doesn't want to.	Nunc non velit.
What if this and what if it.	Quid si hoc et quid si illud.
I'm done thinking now.	Ego feci cogitare nunc.
No one wants to be yourself.	Nulla ut ipsum velit.
Which I like.	Quod mihi placet.
Him.	Ipsum.
But it is not evil.	Sed non est malum.
i also was.	ego quoque eram.
I don't know what no one does for me.	Nescio quod nemo mihi non enim.
which is yours.	quam tuum est.
We can learn this.	Hoc scire possumus.
Tell me if it is not.	Dic mihi si non est.
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
I'd be happy to do that.	Quod facere vellem felix.
Who did it.	Qui fecit.
He said well.	Dixit bene.
.	.
Not so well.	Non tam bene.
He could hear.	Audire potuit.
It's not yours anymore.	Non est tuum amplius.
Maybe it wasn't before.	Aliquam non erat ante.
I knew something was coming.	Sciebam aliquid venire.
Not so long after.	Non ita multo post.
I'm afraid you don't do anything.	Vereor ne aliquid facias.
Hardly the same.	Vix ipse.
It should be done.	Debet esse factum.
Now neither was it.	Nunc nec erat.
It wasn't that hard.	Non erat id difficile.
I will say one more time.	Dicam unum tempus.
I'll tell you what's going to happen.	Dicam quid futurum sit.
i didn't think.	non putavi.
She doesn't speak this way.	Hoc modo illa non loqui.
I wanted to see you again.	Iterum videre volui.
Time is important now.	Tempus sit amet nunc.
I don't know what it is.	Nescio quid sit.
You can finally see.	Tandem videre potes.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id erat ipsum.
Getting there.	Questus est.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I don't think much wrong.	Non puto multum mali.
I don't want to talk.	Nolo loqui.
not in question.	Non in quaestionem.
But the thing is in it.	Sed res in.
All this is.	Totum hoc est.
I'm not that kind of hard.	Id genus non sum difficile.
Do it in this way, not in that way.	Fac hoc modo, non illo modo.
For the future.	Futurum enim.
Please don't let me see.	Non placet me videre.
No that was none.	Nulla id nulla erat.
And it is.	Et est.
That's how important it is.	Ut sit amet quam.
I tried, but it could not be done.	Conatus sum, sed fieri non potuit.
It has mine.	Sic mea habet.
However,	Autem,
But he could not.	Sed potuit.
We can do something better for me.	Aliquid mihi melius facere possumus.
But as always he will.	Sed ut semper velit.
Wants to be busy.	Velit esse occupatus.
Where there is nothing.	Ubi nihil est.
yes or until now.	Etiam vel quam nunc.
But before that time.	Sed id tempus ante.
But to whom.	Sed ut quam.
Really wanted something more.	Plus aliquid vere voluit.
This must be done.	Hoc faciendum est.
I wish you're still very much.	Volo te esse adhuc valde.
I can't believe this one.	Non possum credere hic est.
He wanted to be alone.	Solus esse voluit.
I thought it was good.	bonum esse putavi.
He would never be a man.	Nunquam esset homo.
He can speak, but not speak.	Loqui potest, sed non loqui.
This means a lot to you and i did it.	Hoc est multum tibi, et feci ei.
And we're good at it.	Et sumus bonum in eo.
He didn't want to do this.	Noluit hoc facere.
It was really easy.	Vere erat facile.
I thought I would be home now.	Putavi fore nunc domum.
I have a dog that is my boy.	Canem habeo quod puer meus est.
I forgot everything about it.	Oblitus essem omnia de illo.
I don't know what but.	Nescio quid, sed.
I just couldn't think of this.	Modo haec cogitare non potuit.
What he understood.	Quod ille intellexit.
Certainly I am not.	Certe non sum.
I tried to talk it through but I couldn't.	Conatus eum dicere sed per non potui.
I don't want to be that person anymore.	Nolo esse quod homo amplius.
and you.	et tu.
Your plan will work.	Tuum consilium erit opus.
Well, it's good.	Bene, bonum eius.
And that is good.	Et id est bona.
And you're probably right.	Et tu probabiliter recte.
Better you need me to come.	Melius, me venire debes.
No one wants to have it all.	Nemo id velit, omnes habere.
He refused to stop.	Noluit prohibere.
We are lucky to have it here.	Felix hic sumus habere eam.
In this way he said he would not.	Hoc modo dixit nolebat.
I don't know what you did.	Nescio quid tibi fecerit.
Which was true.	Quod verum erat.
You know to come and come.	Venire scis, et venit.
I know nothing about him.	nihil de illo scio.
Even in time.	Etiam in tempore.
Probably a lot of time.	Verisimiliter multum tempus.
you can know.	scire potes.
I don't make friends easily.	Amicos non facile facio.
I said nothing to him.	ei nihil dixi.
What is.	Quid enim.
But that's very important.	Sed ut ipsum sit amet est.
I can't talk to you.	Non possum loqui tecum.
But he knew that he could do nothing.	Sed sciebat nihil facere posse.
I'm sorry it was.	Me paenitet eam fuisse.
He did not know what he was going to do.	Nesciebat quid facturus esset.
But there is a lot to be said for.	Sed sit amet dictum enim.
No one could know.	Nemo scire potuit.
Stop! 	Prohibere!
It's out there.	Est ex non.
I could hear.	audire potui.
I still have that problem.	Adhuc habeo quod quaestio.
A little longer.	Paulo diutius.
he did his own thing.	rem suam fecit.
I also wanted to play.	Ludere me quoque voluit.
And we are	Et sumus .
He didn't want to think about it.	Noluit cogitare de illo.
Even not before him.	Etiam nec ipsum ante.
But it will take some time.	Sed id aliquam tempus.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
Well, until now.	Bene, usque nunc.
It would seem that his name is not even true.	Videtur quod ne nomen quidem eius verum est.
Maybe tomorrow, perhaps in a year.	Forsitan cras, fortasse in anno.
for never.	numquam enim.
But it was done.	Sed factum est.
Not so hard about me.	Non ita fere mihi.
To be happy with yourself.	Ut sit amet ex ipsum.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
Only that's hard to do.	Tantum quod difficile est facere.
Please tell me if you can think better.	Dic quaeso si melius potes cogitare.
It does not please.	Non placet.
Not him indeed.	Non illum quidem.
They are not.	Non sunt.
But he does this really well.	Sed hoc vere satis bene facit.
He told me.	Is mihi dixit.
He was not, but knows.	Non erat, sed scit.
i can't talk when.	non possum dicere, cum.
As it is, it is not possible.	Ut est, non potest.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
It's done a lot for me.	Multum mihi factum est.
as it seemed true.	sicut verum videbatur.
this may not even be possible.	id ne fieri quidem quidem potest.
here's my question.	Hic est quaestio mea.
Nothing here for him.	Nihil hic illum.
And that is.	Et id est.
Something can be done.	Fieri aliquid potest.
I'm sorry about tonight.	Paenitet de nocte.
It's still mine.	Est adhuc mea.
This is often not true.	Hoc saepe non est verum.
I never wanted.	Numquam volui.
But quickly of him.	Sed cito de illo.
which is the case.	quod ita se res habet.
Not us.	Non nobis.
Not at all before.	Non omnino ante.
It was more of us than of you.	Plus erat de nobis quam de te.
So he likes it.	Sic ille placet.
to do for you.	ut faciam tibi.
But it is the same.	Idem tamen est.
I am well prepared.	Bene paratus sum.
I think we all know that.	Omnes puto scire.
It is the same.	Simile est.
I feel at home.	Domi me sentio.
This is about.	Haec de.
Enough time to get it.	Satis temporis ad illud.
What a day he thought.	Quam diem putabat.
I just don't know.	Modo nescio.
But he does.	Sed facit.
For sure I have this not to be.	Pro certo habeo hoc non esse.
I told him a good job.	Dixi ei bonum officium.
He wanted to know what he wanted to know.	Scire voluit quid scire vellet.
There is no such thing here.	Hic aliquid non est.
I knew for sure.	Pro certo sciebam.
He never said why.	Numquam dixit quare.
But there is nothing else.	Sed non est aliud.
And you never know.	Numquam et.
We can certainly talk now if you'd like.	Certe nunc loqui possumus si velis.
Looks like what's your name.	Simile quid tibi nomen est.
What thing?	Quam rem?
But the thing is now.	Sed res nunc.
If it is not, it will be nothing.	Si non est, nihil erit.
But he could not say this.	Sed hoc dicere non potuit.
but he knew it.	sed sciebat.
You don't need to know this to think.	Hoc scire non debes cogitare.
still not getting.	Adhuc non questus.
I can't believe.	Credere possum.
This is correct.	Hoc bene est.
This guy.	Hoc guy.
and so much was with me.	et sic multum erat apud me.
It is not his.	Non eius.
No, not.	Non, non.
Maybe that's said no.	Aliquam id dictum nulla.
I just think about how it is.	Ego iustus cogitare quomodo est.
Nor can I.	Nec possum.
Everything has time.	Omnia tempus habet.
But he understood nothing wrong.	Nihil tamen mali intellexit.
He did not give.	Non dedit.
Well, maybe that's the thing.	Bene, res forte est.
Let me speak.	Fac me loqui.
It was time for us to go.	Tempus erat nos ire.
But at last he was there.	Sed tandem ibi fuit.
That's very well done.	Optime id quod valde.
Which I am very afraid of.	Quod valde vereor.
It just doesn't like listening.	Is iustus non placet audire.
It will not be.	Non erit.
And it was good for me.	Et bene mihi fuit.
I didn't have room to do it.	Non habuit cubiculum ad faciendum.
And this is the way.	Et hoc est iter.
Someone can do it.	Potest aliquis facere.
he said that he knew.	dixit se scire.
this is possible.	id fieri potest.
He knew she was coming to him.	Sciebat eam ad se venire.
and he understood something else.	et aliud intellexit.
Now he was ready.	Erat autem paratus.
He knew that.	Sciebat.
nor do I want to see you.	nec te videre volo.
You'll never do that.	Numquam id facere.
If that's what it is.	Si id quod est.
Not us, not me.	Non nobis, non me.
He had a good time.	Bene habuit.
But here we are.	Sed hic sumus.
I tried to speak.	loqui conatus sum.
It is important for him.	Aliquam sit amet ipsum enim.
But that's how important.	Sed id magna quam.
There was a need to win.	Vincere opus erat.
Her job is always the same.	Eius officium est semper idem.
Hardly a journey.	Vix iter.
It was great.	In magna erat.
the man was never at home.	vir domi numquam fuit.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
You can do whatever you don't want.	Et genus quod potes, non vis.
Yes that is.	Ita quod est.
But that is who they are.	Sed id est quis sunt.
I don't need to listen to you.	Non opus est tibi audire.
I am ready now.	Paratus nunc sum.
Let me do it yourself.	Fac me id ipsum.
she saw the future.	eam vidit futurum.
I can't work for one thing.	Unum opus non possum.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
It's too late to find something now.	Sero est aliquid invenire, nunc.
Please play this way.	Ludere hoc modo placet.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
Lunch is good.	Prandium est bonum.
That's not a thing.	Quod non aliquid.
This does not appear.	Hic non videtur.
As of now it is not.	Ut nunc non est.
We cannot accept this.	Non possumus hoc accipere.
You know everything you need to know.	Scis omnia debes scire.
I hope we can do it next year.	Spero nos proximo anno id facere posse.
He didn't understand better.	Melius non intellexit.
Tonight we have nothing.	Hac nocte nihil habemus.
This is a busy day.	Hic est dies occupatus.
Maybe no one was good enough.	Fortasse nemo satis bonus fuit.
So you're like me.	Sic tu sis mihi similis.
I know my job.	Novi officium meum.
The thing seemed no more.	Res amplius non videbatur.
I know him well.	Novi eum bene.
I only want to see this.	Hoc me videre tantum volo.
Never let him down.	Numquam ipsum sit.
Maybe to her.	Forsitan ad eam.
She wants nothing to do with me.	Illa nihil ad me vult habere.
A lot to say.	Multum dicere.
I couldn't believe it at all.	Omnino non potui credere.
he must remain with us.	nobiscum manere debet.
I can never speak to him.	Numquam in illum loqui possum.
Stay with me, he said.	Mane mecum, dixit ei.
He asked what it was.	Quaesivit quid id esset.
I would never love him.	Ut numquam ipsum.
I thought about you so much.	Cogitavi de te tam.
But only she says nothing.	Sed modo haec nihil dicit.
They are both three.	Ambo tres sunt.
Do it for fun.	Fac ut amet.
Everyone speaks of this and no one does anything about it.	de hoc omnes loquitur et nemo de illo aliquid agit.
And it will be.	Et erit.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
I don't think too much about it.	Nimium puto de eo facit.
That's great, great.	Ut magna, magna.
Too bad it is.	Nimis malum est.
He thought it was not likely.	Verisimile non putabat.
I just know it.	Modo id scio.
You never did.	Numquam fecisti.
I don't need a job.	Non opus est officium.
I wish I could get better.	Melius vellem accipere.
He didn't like him.	Noluit ei similis.
i'm at home.	Sum domi.
Someone knows.	Novit aliquis.
No one wants him here.	Nemo hic velit illum.
There was still work to do.	Adhuc opus erat ut faciam.
Maybe you like it.	Fortasse placet.
nor did he wish to have one.	nec unum habere voluit.
i don't know what to think.	nescio quid cogitare.
If you don't want to be friends with me, okay.	Si non vis amicos esse mecum, bene.
They were both at about the same time.	Ambo eo fere tempore.
If not yet.	Si non adhuc.
I just love him.	Ego iustus amo illum.
I can't speak.	Non possum dicere.
That's how it will be.	Id ut erit.
i am really into it.	Ego vere in eam.
But it is so.	Sed ita est.
But there is nothing to say.	Sed nihil est dicere.
I am not good at this.	Non sum bonus ad hoc.
Something must remain.	Aliquid manere debet.
This thing was for me.	Haec res mihi fuit.
And we are.	Et nos sumus.
He was the one who tried to understand.	Is erat qui intelligere conatus est.
Nothing yet.	Adhuc nihil.
It was very important.	Aliquam sit amet erat ipsum.
in or out of.	In vel ex.
Never was this scared.	Nunquam hoc vix fuit.
I have the same money.	Ego autem ipse pecuniam.
As much as you can.	Quantum potes.
Probably, he would.	Probabiliter, voluit.
I would like to stay.	Vellem manere.
And so he did.	Et sic fecit.
I hope soon.	Spero cito.
But for tomorrow	Cras sed enim.
I don't know any more about that than you.	Nescio quid plus quam tu de illo.
It was good to see you again.	Bonum fuit te videre iterum.
Nothing is possible.	Nihil potest.
Ready to go.	Paratus ad ire.
Now I will answer this question.	Dicam nunc hanc quaestionem.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
It probably was.	Probabile fuit.
I just like you one.	Modo ut te unum faciam.
I believe you are.	Credo te esse.
He was three at the time.	Tres erat eo tempore.
He is not here anymore.	Non est hic amplius.
I feel nothing.	nihil sentio.
I would like to stay	manere vellem .
To be honest now.	Ut sit amet nunc.
It was only now.	Nunc id nisi erat.
If not, it is not.	Si non sunt, non est.
I know I'm going to do this.	Hoc scio me esse facturum.
She's trying to do it.	Illa facere conatur.
At length he came.	Tandem venit.
I never wanted to do this.	Numquam hoc facere volui.
It is often difficult to tell what he thinks.	Saepe difficile est narrare quid cogitat.
He did not know.	Nesciebat.
This is not the same.	Hoc idem non est.
You have to go with him.	Ire cum eo habes.
No one knows what.	Nemo scit quid.
But he was as he is.	Sed eum erat ut est.
i thought you might like it.	Putabam te fortasse placet.
Don't give up on.	Noli dare in.
There was something.	Fuit aliquid.
Too bad the thing is.	Nimis res est.
There will be no more.	Nec plus erit.
Time is better one.	Melius est unum tempus.
That is so.	Id ita sit.
He had everything, but it was still a little.	Habuit omnia, sed adhuc parum erat.
He asked what the name was.	Quaesivit quid nomen esset.
GIVEN INTO.	DEDIT IN.
Good to see you.	Bene te videre.
Only.	Solus.
And it was good.	Et fuit bonum.
He did not know if this was necessary.	Nesciebat si hoc opus esset.
That is where we are today.	Id est ubi hodie sumus.
I don't really want that to happen.	Non vere id velle fieri.
It's fine, and I'll be happy soon.	Bene est, et mox felix erit.
This is very good.	Is est valde bonus.
where no one knew.	ubi nemo scivit.
It was a great moment.	Nunc in magna erat.
They are nothing.	Nihil sunt.
Maybe it was not great.	Aliquam non magna erat.
There is something to do like that.	Est aliquid facere ut est.
Is it not? 	Estne?
My bedroom.	Cubiculum meum.
But we're not a little longer.	Sed non parum iam sumus.
But not the same thing.	Sed non id ipsum.
I will not say.	Non dicam.
But see.	Sed vide.
I have seen you.	Vidi te.
I did what you said.	Feci quod dixisti.
I have done it myself.	Feci me ipsum.
In the morning, as always.	Mane, ut semper.
He knew, however, that he was doing this.	Sciebat tamen quod hoc faceret.
asked the teacher.	quaesivit magister.
You should have a job.	Debes habere officium.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
And certainly you are not.	Et certe non es.
Yes it is, you know.	Ita factum est, scis.
In and out.	In et ex.
What should i do for you.	Quid faciam tibi.
I think you are one.	Puto te unum esse.
Now it's too much.	Iam nimium multum est.
Trying to do too much.	Nimium facere conatur.
She was kind.	Fuit genus.
Now who is now.	Nunc quis nunc.
One thing or another.	Aliud vel aliud.
let me speak to her.	ad eam me loqui.
Where do you want to go? 	Quo vis ire?
The father was with me.	Pater erat apud me.
That was my plan.	Meum id consilium fuit.
I don't want to hear this.	Nolo hoc audire.
But who wants to go out.	Sed ut velit quis ex.
So it is.	Ita est.
I know what it is.	Scio quid sit.
Nothing can be done.	Fieri nihil potest.
I didn't know you were right.	Nesciebam te bene agere.
I said not enough.	Parum dixi.
You are the same.	Tu ipse es.
He's not much better.	Non multo melius ipse.
At length the day has come.	Tandem dies venit.
One.	Unus.
There is no question.	Nulla quaestio est.
Say it again.	Dic iterum.
Now I know what's good.	Nunc scio quid sit bonum.
Good things looked better.	Bona vidi melius.
To live so well.	Tam bene vivere.
You're not long after.	Non multo post es.
But you don't want to be there.	Sed ne sit vis nulla.
It also has a name.	Sic etiam nomen habet.
Completely up to you.	Omnino ad vos.
Make one.	Fac unum.
You could do whatever you want.	Posset quod vis.
It will be hard for me to help you.	Id difficile erit mihi ut te adiuvet.
He knew how to do it.	Scivit facere.
That's a game.	Id a velit.
By that time	Per tempus illud.
Stay with you.	Quae mane apud te sunt.
He was able to do what he owes.	Potuit autem facere quod debet.
I couldn't think of anything to say.	Non potuit cogitare quid dicam.
It is necessary to do this.	Necesse est hoc facere.
Not just among us.	Non sicut inter nos.
But he knew that he was speaking.	Sed sciebat se loqui.
But it is.	Sed sit.
Perhaps it was necessary, perhaps not.	Forsitan opus esset, fortasse non.
This is all up to you.	Hoc est totum ad vos.
Yes, that's how it is.	Etiam id quam ipsum.
Maybe from before him.	Aliquam a ante ipsum.
And if there is no evil, it is well.	Et si nihil mali est, bene est.
I just want you to know.	Ego iustus volo te scire.
again i am.	iterum sum.
And this is.	Et hoc est.
I like this job.	Hoc officium mihi placet.
The father did nothing wrong.	Pater nihil mali fecit.
I need to see something.	Mihi opus est videre aliquid.
It is also very important.	Etiam sit amet magna ipsum.
But you are busy.	Sed tu occupatus es.
He could do well.	Bene qui potuit.
But they are not one and the same.	Sed non sunt unum et idem.
Now as much as yourself.	Nunc ut quam ipsum.
But it was not him.	Sed non erat ipsum.
But it was not in me.	Sed non erat in me.
Just Father.	Pater iustus.
I like it enough.	Mihi satis placet.
They definitely know what they want.	Certo quid velit.
But not from him.	Sed non ex ipsum.
My husband does it.	Vir meus facit.
It was true.	Verum erat.
All can be seen.	Omnes posse videri.
Certainly not!	Certe non!
He comes to me.	Venit ad me.
Not a day.	Non dies.
There has to be a problem.	Non habet esse quaestionem.
We can go and be with him.	Ire possumus et cum illo.
Or here.	Vel hic.
Yes, that was some.	Etiam id aliquam erat.
Maybe, rightly so.	Fortasse, recte.
I hope you're much better.	Spero te multo melius.
Nothing else could be done.	Nihil aliud potuit.
But perhaps	Sed fortasse.
Everyone knows this thing too.	Novit omnes res hic quoque.
He likes to be willing to do so.	Velit velit id.
Not today, but.	Non hodie, sed.
to whom it should be.	ad quam esse.
That never really happened.	Quae numquam vere.
I was told, it was done.	Dictum est mihi, factum est.
He could not do anything about it.	Non quo aliquid de eo facere posset.
Again this is true.	Iterum hoc verum est.
I could not think.	Non potui cogitare.
I can't win with it.	Cum eo vincere non possum.
let it be.	Sit sit.
I don't know, not one.	Nescio, non unum.
He does nothing for me.	Nihil mihi facit.
He could not stay here long.	Hic diu manere non potuit.
I won't tell you anything about it.	Ego non dicam tibi aliquid de illo.
He didn't want me.	Noluit me.
Not with him, that is for sure.	Non cum illo, id est certe.
It's up to you.	Est ad te.
It certainly seemed likely.	Verisimile certe videbatur.
We can't go tonight or tomorrow.	Hac nocte vel cras ire non possumus.
I am so surprised at the truth.	Ita verum miror.
I wonder about him.	Miror de eo.
You are that man.	Tu ille homo.
It was still morning.	Mane tamen fuit.
And it will be.	Et erit.
Maybe it was even true.	Fortasse etiam verum fuit.
I know you can't see everything.	Scio te omnia videre non potes.
It was in some way.	Aliquam in aliquam erat.
You should.	Debes.
You want to get email.	Vis ut quis.
To which it is good.	Ad quod bonum est.
I do not love you.	Non amo te.
This was not at home.	Hoc domi non erat.
Well too bad for you.	Bene etiam malum est tibi.
I just can't wait.	Modo nescit.
I am sure of it.	Certus sum ex eo.
If it could be done.	Quod si fieri posset.
never, never, never.	numquam, numquam, numquam.
He is a man.	Homo est.
When my father saw it.	Cum pater vidit.
That's where we get.	Id est quo nobis ut.
You need to do the work.	Opus facere debes.
we are men.	homines sumus.
See id.	Vide id.
I have also heard it.	id quoque audivi.
About me and you.	De me et te.
I don't think anything.	Non cogitat aliquid.
However, he does not want to.	Tamen non vult.
I can't believe you do this.	Non possum credere te hoc facere.
I don't want to see someone.	Nolo videre aliquem.
Nothing more could be done.	Nihil amplius posset.
That's who he was.	Id quis erat.
It is your job to do well.	Tuum est officium tuum bene agere.
not a dog.	canis non.
We believe in.	Nobis in.
I don't feel bad yet.	Malum non sentio tamen.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
I don't need to tell you.	Non opus est tibi dicere.
I hope all is well with you.	Spero bene tibi.
I think you tried, perhaps you even tried.	Conatus puto, fortasse etiam conatus est.
I'd better go now.	Melius nunc ire vellem.
I like or no.	Ut vel nulla velit.
This he gave.	Hoc ille dedit.
But what could not have been done was done.	Quod tamen fieri non potuit, factum est.
the best I could see.	optime videre non potui.
You tried the best!.	Conatus optime!.
I'm still getting it.	Im 'etiam questus est.
It was something more.	Plus aliquid erat.
That's a good day.	Id est in die enim bona.
You have to do that.	Quod tibi faciendum est.
That's how it is.	Id ipsum quam id sit.
Would be.	Facturum esse.
I must do more.	plus mihi faciendum est.
I can't believe it.	Credere non possum.
Yes I was.	Ita eram.
I just don't know how to do it.	Modo nescio quomodo facere.
That was not enough.	Id parum erat.
It is not easy.	Non facile.
It is.	Sic est.
I'm the only one up yet.	Ego ad unum tantum usque adhuc.
I could not believe.	Non potui credere.
But not already there.	Sed non iam ibi.
Sure enough for someone to be.	Certo satis est aliquem esse.
Good thing he said.	Bonum dixit.
I don't know anything about this.	Nescio quid de hoc.
Nothing yet.	Nihil adhuc.
He thought.	Putabat.
When he wants something, he does it.	Cum velit aliquid, id facit.
I've never seen it before.	Nunquam id ante vidi.
He probably can't deal with it.	Probabiliter agere non potest.
Which no one has ever seen.	Quod nemo umquam vidit.
It was not that he wanted him any more.	Non erat quod ei amplius vellet.
I want someone to know that.	Scire volo quod aliquis.
Better than nothing.	Melius quam nihil.
This was his work.	Hoc opus eius fuit.
But little has been done.	Sed parum factum est.
No one should give anything for me.	Nemo debet dare quod pro me.
I thought it was not necessary.	Non opus esse putavi.
But it was not, nor was it not.	Sed non erat nec non.
As much as you want.	Quantum vis.
It is true.	Verum est.
May it be for us.	Sit nobis.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
He was very lonely.	Solus erat valde.
The truth is what you have.	Verum est quod habes.
I wished this had been better.	Hoc volui melius fuisse.
I know exactly what you want.	Novi prorsus quid velis.
I hope you're good enough.	Spero te satis.
And so to both.	Et sic ad utrumque.
Please take a look.	Vide quaeso.
I don't have to do anything.	Non ad aliquid.
Maybe it's not time.	Aliquam nec tempus est.
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
Which never and never.	Quae numquam et numquam.
Something was going to happen.	Aliquid erat futurum.
None in a big save.	Nulla in magna nisi.
You've done that before.	Fecisti ut ante.
They are very good.	Valde.
I don't know where it is.	Nescio ubi sit.
You know, it's not like that.	Scis, non sic esse.
He went to his house.	Domum eius abiit.
Well maybe school.	Bene fortasse schola.
nor could he think now.	nec nunc cogitare potuit.
Well there it is.	Bene ibi est.
I need a job.	Mihi opus est officium.
That's because i knew.	Id scivi.
This year, finally over.	Hoc anno, tandem per.
It was good and bad.	Factum est bonum et malum.
I think it's going to happen soon.	Mox futurum puto.
Here all .	Haec omnia .
Where from.	Quo ex.
Don't listen to him.	Noli eum audire.
he has his own.	habet suum.
We are not.	Non sumus.
Maybe he's here.	Fortasse hic est.
And here it is.	Et hic est.
You know you need to leave it up.	Scis debes eam relinquere.
Not a lot of time.	Non multum tempus.
Everything is good.	Omnia est bonum.
And yet.	Et tamen.
Please do better.	Quaeso fac bonum esse.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
Don't talk to me now.	Noli me nunc loqui.
Usually they are not.	Fere non sunt.
But neither is none at all.	Sed nec nulla nulla.
This is so much work.	Hoc tantum opus.
She asked you.	Rogavit te.
Maybe it was that.	Aliquam erat quam.
I never met.	Numquam occurrit.
Don't talk to him.	Non loqui ei.
Me and you.	Meum et tuum.
That's what we're here for.	Id quod hic sumus.
Now I know this.	Nunc id scio.
Yes that's always great.	Etiam id semper magna.
Even someone who's great.	Etiam quis aliquam magna.
he knew nothing.	nihil sciebat.
That's not to be.	Id non esse.
We don't have much to say to each other.	Non multa habemus inter se dicere.
But things could not have been better.	Res tamen melius fieri potuit.
I'm not sure if this is possible.	Non sum certus si id fieri potest.
One for sure.	Unus certe.
I can't be sure about it.	Certus sum de illo esse non possum.
He didn't want to go.	Noluit ire.
I don't want to talk to a boy.	Nolo loqui puer.
I just want to win.	EGO iustus volo vincere.
We can do whatever you want.	Possumus facere quod vis.
She told me already.	Illa mihi iam indicavit.
That was all.	Totum illud erat.
No one does it anymore.	Nemo id amplius facit.
I do not doubt.	non dubito.
So he thought.	Ita putavit.
But that is nothing.	Sed id est ut nihil.
It's not true for you.	Non verum est tibi.
Maybe next year.	Fortasse anno proximo.
that he would do it.	id se facturum.
It is not the same.	Non idem.
I thought nothing of it more than that.	Ego nihil in eo plus cogitavi quam illud.
Nothing is.	Nihil est.
He did not know if this was necessary.	Nesciebat si hoc opus esset.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
That doesn't surprise him.	Id eum non miror.
not out yet.	Non ex adhuc.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
This is before all.	Hoc est ante omnia.
i thought you were friends.	Putabam amicos esse.
But not from the game.	Sed non ex velit.
That's what he wants.	Id velit.
At a certain time before.	Certo tempore ante.
I didn't want to talk.	Nolui loqui.
Maybe he didn't think so.	Fortasse non putabat.
It will be for all.	Sic erit omnibus.
I knew indeed.	Sciebam quidem.
All this is possible.	Hoc totum potest.
Or he speaks.	Vel loquitur.
I am not sure.	Non sum certus.
We can do nothing.	Nihil facere possumus.
Or perhaps.	Vel fortasse.
But he could not tell after the time.	Sed nescire potuit post tempus.
He could, however.	Potuit tamen.
I'm going to get you.	Eo ut te.
I have not seen it before.	Non vidi ante.
He said nothing to me at all.	Mihi omnino nihil dixit.
But what has happened has been done.	Sed quid acciderit, factum est.
He refused to leave her there.	Noluit eam ibi relinquere.
He was there.	Ille fuit.
I'm never sorry to talk to.	Numquam paenitet me loqui usque.
No that's what it is.	Nulla id quam est.
Unless somebody say something.	Nisi quis aliquid.
i am not yet.	Ego non adhuc.
We're always in now.	Nunc in semper sumus.
I know what happened, and you.	Scio quid acciderit, et tu.
He already knows better.	Iam melius novit.
what i've seen.	quod ego vidi.
I do not know.	Nescio.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
He was not yet at home.	Nondum domi erat.
It's already enough.	Jam satis est.
I said nothing to him.	nihil ei dixi.
So you.	Sic vos.
Be there with you one day.	Ibi cum dies unus.
It was his only time.	Eius solum tempus erat.
It seems almost the same to me.	Mihi idem fere videtur.
I know everything.	Novi omnia.
Man alone knows that he lives.	Homo solus scit se vivere.
I really do this.	Hoc vere sum facis.
now i have	nunc habeo.
I have lunch for you.	Prandium habeo tibi.
Do better than that.	Facere melius quam.
with her.	Cum eam.
But one thing.	Unum tamen.
Get in now.	Ut in nunc.
You did what was done.	Fecisti quod factum est.
That's not the same thing.	Ut nec ipsum ipsum.
Now you have a plan to do.	Nunc consilium habes ut faciam.
But neither will he.	Sed nec velit.
There is someone here.	Est hic aliquis.
I don't know if that's good.	Nescio si id bonum est.
it's not too late for us.	non nimis sero est nobis.
He always says it.	Semper id dicit.
Now she thought.	Iam putavit.
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
I see nothing more that we can do now.	Nihil amplius video quod nunc facere possumus.
But they are .	Sed sunt .
you already know.	iam scis.
And she could do something.	Et posset aliquid.
I could see him coming by.	per huc venire potui videre.
Both are necessary.	Utrumque opus est.
No one knew what could be done.	Nemo sciebat quid fieri posset.
But this is no longer true at all.	Sed hoc iam non est omnino verum.
He can't do this.	Hoc facere non potest.
I can still say nothing.	Nihil adhuc possum dicere.
We don't have a plan.	Non habemus consilium.
It's like so	Est ut sic.
Yes it was last year.	Ita proximo anno fuit.
Yes, as before.	Etiam, ut ante.
Not really.	Non vere.
We have room here.	Cubiculum hic habemus.
Not for me.	Non mihi.
Sorry for everything.	Nos paenitet omnia.
I knew this too.	id quoque sciebam.
Got to stop.	Obtinuit prohibere.
And this would be.	Et hoc esset.
But this has been done exactly.	Hoc tamen prorsus factum est.
That may help.	Quod ut adiuvet.
My dad is never happy.	Pater meus numquam felix est.
Tell me why.	Dic mihi quare.
He refused to speak.	Noluit loqui.
That's already done.	Id iam factum est.
What do you think.	Quid vobis videtur.
Someone say this to me too.	Aliquis id mihi quoque.
Just like my name.	Sicut nomen meum.
already purchased.	Iam emit.
I just want to be the one.	Iustus volo ut ille.
He did not know what that was.	Quid illud sit, nesciebat.
I don't want anything else from that.	Nolo aliud ex illa.
I am not yet ready to speak with you.	nondum paratus sum loqui tecum.
But there was none at all.	Sed non erat nulla.
I couldn't think of anything that was good enough.	Non potui cogitare aliquid quod satis esset.
That was the most important thing to all.	Quod primum omnibus erat.
you said.	dixisti.
Maybe he could not.	Fortasse non potuit.
Maybe that was good.	Forsitan quod erat bonum.
I don't want to hear.	Nolo audire.
I hope you're coming soon!.	Spero te cito venire !.
She does well too.	Bene etiam illa facit.
But it is not so.	Sed non est ita.
Stay here with me.	Mane hic mecum.
he was of his own.	de suo erat.
To think and to think.	Cogitare et cogitare.
I can say nothing about him.	De illo nihil possum dicere.
Do whatever you have.	Fac si quid habes.
That's who it is.	Id quis enim.
But not all are evil.	Non omnes autem mali sunt.
But there is no longer what it is.	Sed iam non est quid est.
I never really thought.	Numquam rem putavi.
Not much.	Non multum.
Maybe she loves you too.	Forsitan etiam amat te.
Not so with me.	Non ita mecum.
And it was good for me.	Et bene mihi erat.
He doesn't have much.	Non multum habet.
You are right.	Recte facis.
Something about time.	Aliquid de tempore.
All is well.	Omnes bene.
You are among your friends.	Tu inter amicos es.
It is and will be.	Est, et erit.
I am working for this.	Hoc opus ego sum.
You live with him.	Te vivere cum illo.
I want you to do what you want.	Volo te facere quod vis.
Good work if you can get it.	Bonum opus, si potes accipere.
I don't know where he is now.	Ubi nunc est nescio.
Maybe you will too.	Forsitan erit tu quoque.
What she did not do.	Quod illa non fecit.
That's some.	Id aliquam.
He wanted to know what it was.	Scire voluit quid esset.
For it will be a good day.	Dies enim bonus erit.
He loves you very much.	Te valde amat.
I am not sure.	Ego sum non certus.
Not much today.	Non multum hodie.
It's late again.	Sero iterum.
But there was none.	Sed non nulla erat.
But there was none at all.	Sed non erat nulla.
I don't know what it is.	Id esse nescio.
But that's not true.	Sed id non.
To speak.	Loqui.
never, ever.	numquam, umquam.
And it is evil.	Et malum est.
You can do the same.	Idem facere potes.
This is now certain.	Hoc nunc certum est.
I myself.	Me ipsum.
No one can stop me.	Nemo me prohibere potest.
He does his job really well.	Bene facit rem suam officium.
No .	Non .
There is none.	Nulla est.
The thing is.	In res est.
This is pretty certain.	Hoc satis certum est.
the boy knows better enough to do just that.	melius scit puer satis facere sicut ei dictum est.
Not even this.	Ne hoc quidem.
I have no advice.	Consilium non habeo.
Look at this for yourself.	Hoc tibi vide.
It will be fine for you.	Bene tibi erit.
Nothing else to say.	Nihil aliud dicere.
Not much.	Non multum.
For he knew.	Sciebat enim.
Not quickly, but also.	Non cito, sed etiam.
No no, no.	Non non, non.
It was not as easy as he thought.	Non tam facile fuit quam ille putabat.
Don't even want it.	Ne id quidem velit.
I was not very good in school.	In schola non eram valde bonus.
It's time to take some time now.	Aliquam tempus nunc ipsum.
I'm just a little bad.	Non sum parum malum.
He was mine.	Meus ille fuit.
And you never will.	Et numquam et.
He says that all is well.	Dicit omnia bene esse.
This is important.	Hoc sit amet.
i made one	unum feci.
I am her.	eam ego.
I don't know whether this is working or not.	Nescio utrum hoc opus sit necne.
Finally he wanted to tell us everything.	Tandem omnia nobis narrare voluit.
it was my name.	mihi nomen erat.
He is also very happy.	Etiam sit amet ipsum quam.
And he saw.	Vidit autem.
I'm so hard at it right now.	Im tam difficile ad quod nunc.
This is your happy day.	Haec est tibi felix dies.
I see right through you.	recte per te video.
We are both.	Ambo sumus.
You can do more than you think.	Plus potes, quam cogitas.
Yes it is possible.	Ita fieri potest.
This is the same thing.	Hic idem.
that was the plan.	id consilium fuit.
It was not hard to find.	Non erat difficile invenire.
You know I can't.	Scis non potest.
But it is how.	Sed est quam.
Until this morning	Hoc usque mane
But not.	Sed non.
What happened to us?	Quid inter nos acciderit.
He could not.	Non potuit.
To me.	Mihi.
Do just what you want.	Fac modo quod vis.
And you did not do this.	Et hoc non fecisti.
I like to do my job.	Mihi placet facere officium meum.
I made him easy.	Facile eum feci.
Not much, yes, he thought.	Non multum, etiam, putabat.
That man is gone.	Abiit ille homo.
I don't doubt you well.	Non dubito te bene.
It is true.	Verum est.
There is no one here.	Nulla quis hic.
I usually like it a lot.	Fere multum placet.
I don't want to know why someone did something.	Non vis scire quare aliquis aliquid fecerit.
But he himself.	Ipse tamen.
But the matter.	Sed rem.
Not really.	Non vere.
This work is great.	Hoc opus magna.
Which never happened.	Quae numquam.
He wanted to go quickly.	Cito ire voluit.
It was a bad thing.	Malum erat.
i think i have done it.	fecisse puto.
Not either.	Non vel.
This is between the two.	Hoc est inter utrumque.
I want to know you, not you.	Scire te volo, non te.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
But certainly none.	Sed certe nulla.
I was okay with that.	Cum bene essem.
I hope at least not so much.	Spero certe non ita esse.
It is important before him.	Aliquam sit amet ante ipsum.
My advice is not to have a plan.	Consilium meum non est habere consilium.
I wanted us.	Volui nos.
All and nothing.	Omnia, et nihil.
He must be his.	Debet esse eius.
He does not know what he is saying.	Nescit quid loquitur.
Really good advice.	Vere bonum consilium.
But not.	Sed non.
And it is good.	Et bonum est.
He was very scared.	Vix erat admodum.
This time was fixed.	Hoc tempus certum erat.
It is not true.	Non est verum.
Even now it is not.	Etiam non nunc est.
I am not so surprised.	Non ita miror.
Do it to win tonight.	Fac id hac nocte vincere.
This year is different.	Hoc anno aliud est.
Are you ready?	Esne paratus?
But that's how.	Sed id quam.
There was just still work to do.	Sicut adhuc opus erat facere.
morning and night.	Mane et nocte.
I don't know for sure.	Nescio certe.
I won't talk to you much longer.	Non sum loqui ad te multo diutius.
He doesn't want to talk to me.	Mihi loqui non vult.
You know, I never was that bad.	Scis, numquam id malum fuit.
Both are true.	Utrumque verum est.
And there is no one who can prevent it.	Et nemo est qui prohibere possit.
Maybe it was great.	Aliquam et erat magna.
I am sure it works with you.	Certus sum tecum agit.
i'm ready now.	paratus sum nunc.
Well enough about it.	Bene de eo satis.
Since.	Ex quo.
I don't really feel it.	Non sentio rem.
Certainly better than it was before.	Certe melius quam ante fuit.
I have done the right thing.	rem recte feci.
It will be the same.	Simile erit.
I think you could do it.	Puto te posse id facere.
He was not alone in it.	Solus eius non fuit.
He gave to us.	dedit nobis.
.	.
But it is not now.	Sed non est nunc.
How does he do this?	Quomodo hoc facit?
I don't want you.	Nolo tibi.
Yes, but there was some.	Etiam sed aliquam erat.
Take a look at the problem.	Vide quaestionem.
I just want to be sure.	EGO iustus volo esse certus.
I don't know how true it is.	Quantum verum sit nescio.
But it was not always.	Sed non semper erat.
I have a trip this week.	Hoc septimana iter habeo.
If you haven't already.	Si nondum.
He was before me.	Erat ipsum, ante me.
Well it was ahead of time.	Bene erat ante tempus.
We like it.	Placet nobis.
I will tell you.	Dicam tibi.
Why did you choose that job?	Quid feci tibi vis illa officium?
I do nothing.	Nihil facio.
yes it is time.	Etiam tempus est.
This dog was alone.	Hic canis solus erat.
Maybe you can't stay.	Fortasse non manere.
But not much.	Sed non multum.
He is going to see you.	Eat te videre.
This was not going to happen.	Hoc non erat futurum.
Something about him.	Aliquid de eo.
Not that much either.	Quod non vel multa.
I can't get enough tomorrow.	Non possum satis cras.
For today or	Hodie enim an.
The boy was not here.	Puer hic non erat.
You have him.	Habes eum.
But it was only said.	Sed non dictum nisi.
Tell me about the future.	Dic mihi futurum.
which I knew now.	quod nunc sciebam.
I looked good.	Vidi bonum.
And it is evil.	Et malum est.
We can't even see anything.	Aliquid etiam videre non possumus.
I'm with you here.	Ego tecum sum hic.
And he was among all things.	Erat autem inter omnia.
I don't like anything.	Non placet quicquam.
That is, isn't it?	Id est, annon?
She did not eat lunch.	Illa prandium non comedit.
I don't like men.	Non amo homines.
I want to believe.	Credere volo.
Too quickly.	Nimis cito.
You are where you want to be.	Tu ubi vis esse.
I know better.	Melius scio.
It appears that things are gone.	Videtur res ut sunt.
This was your plan.	Hoc tuum consilium fuit.
I'm so happy to be here.	Im tam felix hic esse.
Now there is a great question.	Nunc magna quaestio est.
But it was not that.	Sed non erat id.
He really wants.	Ut vere velit.
I never wanted anything else from him.	Numquam aliud ab eo volui.
I will make some decision for you.	Aliquid tibi faciam consilium.
That's your decision to do.	Id tuum consilium facere.
For he was his.	Erat enim eius.
Well, that's my job.	Bene, ut officium meum est.
Look where you got it.	Vide ubi id obtinuit.
They are not yet at home.	Nondum domi sunt.
But he did not want to think that he could.	Sed noluit cogitare posse.
I was pretty busy.	Satis occupatus eram.
It's not so mine.	Non ita mea est.
Certainly you have done this before.	Certe hoc ante fecisti.
Great to see what you want.	Magna est videre quod velis.
He could not.	Non potuit.
I don't want it.	Non volo.
Well that was.	Bene id esset.
One could only think of this.	Hoc unum modo potuit cogitare.
It's not so good here.	Tam bene non est hic.
I don't know this man.	Nescio hic homo.
They are essentially the same.	Per se idem sunt.
I feel this way.	Sic sentio.
But it was important.	Aliquam sit amet nisi erat.
Well, you didn't.	Bene, non fecisti.
I tried something else this time.	Conatus sum aliquid aliud hoc tempore.
he would not speak.	loqui nolebat.
Thus he said.	Sic ille.
That which is not is not there.	Quod non est, non est ibi.
He was, he saw now.	Erat, vidit nunc.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
We can do great things together.	Simul magna possumus.
Now who wished he was.	Nunc quis velit erat.
I just don't know what it's about.	Modo quid suus 'non scit.
No that's great.	Nulla id magna.
I feel I don't really want it.	Sentio non me vere volo.
It is necessary to do something.	Necesse est aliquid agere.
I thought it was pretty good.	Putavi satis bene.
He said it was going to be a lot for him.	Multum sibi futurum esse dixit.
He could easily say this.	Facile id dicere potuit.
Yes to all.	Ita omnibus.
For he did not know what it was.	Non enim sciebat quid esset.
It seems that everything.	Videtur quod omnibus.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
But as always and in him.	Sed ut semper et, in ipsum.
It's for you.	Est enim tibi.
Nor could he.	Nec potuit.
and.	et in.
He would not listen.	Noluit audire.
You can almost know for sure.	Fere non potes pro certo scire.
Certainly it is only time.	Certe tantum tempus est.
I couldn't think of anything to say.	Non potui cogitare quid dicam.
This is not working.	Hoc non opus est.
he had a plan, and he saw it through.	consilium habuit et vidit per.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
i thought what it was like.	Putabam quid simile esset.
It should not be done.	Fieri non debet.
how to listen.	quam audire.
He understood.	Intellexit.
It's big enough.	Satis magna est.
He was in that very thing.	In id ipsum erat.
Only did the job.	Tantum fecit officium.
I have been together all night.	omnibus una nocte fui.
I hardly feel it.	vix sentio.
Do it yourself.	Fac tibi.
It was always late.	Sero semper fuit.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
So it is.	Ita est.
This is your.	Tuum est.
I am still yours.	adhuc tua sum .
he does not even have a name.	ne nomen quidem habet.
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
He could not speak to us.	Nobis loqui non potuit.
It was easy.	Facile factum est.
I think he has done a good job.	Puto eum bonum officium fecisse.
I want to know who did this.	Volo scire quis hoc fecerit.
He could not travel.	Iter facere potuit.
I can see nothing.	Nihil possum videre.
There was even more.	Plus etiam fuit.
He is gone.	Abiit.
Now back to reality.	Nunc ad rem.
and never saw.	et numquam vidit.
He knew he could not do this.	Scivit hoc facere non posse.
My one question is.	Mea una quaestio est.
I'm happy enough about it.	De eo gaudeo satis.
I'm really late.	Vere sero sum.
Do you want to do this?	Visne hoc facere?
This was also good.	Hoc etiam bonum erat.
It could be better now.	Modo melius possit eum.
It was on time.	Esset in tempore.
I know you need to do it.	Scio te opus facere.
I couldn't think of anything else.	Non potui cogitare aliud.
But he did not say.	Sed non dixit.
I can.	Possum.
You'd have everything we have.	Omnia quae habemus, habere velis.
i have to have.	habeo habere.
It was certainly enough.	Satis certe fuit.
But that's only the same thing.	Sed id ipsum nisi.
You don't like one.	Tibi non placet unum.
We don't have anything like that.	Non habemus aliquid simile.
Now that was the same thing.	Nunc id ipsum erat.
What is he doing?	Quid agit?
I just don't think about it.	Modo non cogitat de.
You have done all right.	Omnia recte fecisti.
I don't know.	Non novi.
He saw.	Vidit.
It will be too late.	Sero erit.
But that was great.	Sed id erat magna.
Can't see too much.	Nimium videre potest.
You have to come with him.	Habes cum eo venire.
Or attempted it.	Vel conatus est.
I need to do something.	Opus est ut facias aliquid.
There was only one who could.	Unus erat ibi qui posset.
That was the same thing.	Id ipsum erat.
You need to do this.	Hoc debes facere.
What's a guy.	Quid a guy.
He knows you.	Scit te.
Something similar.	Simile quid.
therefore ill.	quare male.
It could be great for him.	Posset esse magna ei.
You can do nothing.	Nihil potes.
You know your room.	Scis cubiculum tuum.
He thought everyone would see her.	Putabat omnes eam videre.
Maybe you are one.	Forsitan unus es.
I didn't want to see someone.	Nolui videre aliquem.
I'm with you.	Sum apud te.
There is no expression.	Nulla dictum.
But he is not listening.	Sed audire non est.
I could not see why.	Cur non potui videri.
Yes, that was some.	Etiam id aliquam erat.
Only you know.	Tantum scis.
My father is not with her.	Pater meus cum illa non est.
But there are some from none.	Sed sunt aliquam ex nulla.
But this is not probable here.	Sed hoc non est probabile hic.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
That was one thing.	Quod erat unum.
We can help you.	Te adiuvare possumus.
This work is our work.	Hoc opus est nobis opus.
But there was something better.	Sed erat aliquid melius.
Was.	Esset.
This made me think.	Haec me cogitare fecit.
talk to him already.	eum jam loqui.
Yes, but it was said.	Etiam sed dictum erat.
It is one thing for me.	Aliud mihi est.
He had enough money to get home enough.	Satis pecuniae satis habuit domum ad domum.
He wanted everything to remain the same.	Idem omnia manere voluit.
The things that are not are mine.	Quae non sunt, mea sunt.
I need to go soon.	Mox opus est ire.
He was a pretty good man.	Satis vir fuit.
He said this very thing.	Id ipsum dixit.
I guess we need to talk about this.	Suspicor nos de hoc loqui necesse est.
That was necessary.	Quod necesse fuit.
The whole plan.	Totum consilium.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
Not as it seems.	Non ut videtur.
He knows it's not good for him.	Scit non esse sibi bonum.
That's the same thing.	Ut id ipsum est.
I never want you to do anything else.	Numquam te aliud facere volo.
These things are so.	Haec ita sunt.
And now this.	Et nunc hoc.
i never wanted, you know.	numquam volui, scis.
I've never tried.	Ego numquam conatus sum.
I did not see where or how.	Non vidit ubi vel quomodo.
I think this is better.	Hoc melius puto.
I know this now.	Hoc nunc scio.
It is not necessary.	Non necesse est.
Something has to be done, and soon!	Faciendum est aliquid, et cito!
This is.	Hic est.
My car	Currus
And don't do it anymore.	Et noli facere amplius.
but often I do.	saepe tamen facio.
He wanted too much.	Nimium voluit.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
I never saw her again.	numquam eam iterum vidi.
He looks at me.	Me spectat.
I don't see the problem.	Non video quaestionem.
It was in a big way.	In in magna erat.
She was like that.	Illa ut erat.
Don't be interested in anything.	Non sit amet aliquam.
But he was not out.	Sed non erat ex.
Do it quickly.	Fac cito.
The season goes well.	Tempore bene.
This is the man who knows everything happens.	Hic est homo qui scit omnia fieri.
I tried so much to get through it but I couldn't.	Conatus sum tantum ut per eam sed non potui.
Work	Opus.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
Can be with you this afternoon.	Is post meridiem tecum esse potest.
It is bad.	Malum est.
Exactly this time.	Prorsus hoc tempore.
Let me do it.	Fac me id.
It was his first time.	Primum eius tempus fuit.
It's just not easy for you to do.	Fac modo tibi non facile est.
Now this is the question.	Haec autem quaestio est.
If ever.	Si semper.
He did not think that he would do one thing.	Non putabat se unum facturum esse.
I've never had a dog.	Canem nunquam habui.
I knew he was going to do it.	Sciebam se facturum esse.
But this does not appear.	Sed hoc non videtur.
Maybe not soon.	Forte non mox.
You do not do evil.	Non facis malum.
I didn't want to hear any more.	Nolui audire amplius.
Yes, that's a great idea.	Etiam id dictum magna.
But perhaps rightly so.	Sed fortasse recte.
No one got hurt.	Nemo malum obtinuit.
Nothing else.	Nihil aliud.
I don't want you to go.	Nolo te ire.
But not now.	Sed nec nunc.
It truly is.	Vere est.
Certainly not so.	Certe non ita est.
I was not there.	Ibi non fui.
No one really speaks of this.	Nemo de hoc vere loquitur.
It was good.	Bonus fuit.
He has his home.	Habet domum suam.
He can't have both.	Utrumque habere non possit.
I really hope he is doing well.	Vere spero bene facit.
We can't be.	Fieri non possumus.
but he has.	sed habet.
where we love you.	ubi nos amo.
No one wants	Nulla quis velit.
But there is no one who does all things.	Sed nemo est qui omnia facit.
No one can do it for you.	Nemo potest te facere.
That's what makes us friends this week.	Id nobis hac septimana facit amicos.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
That's it.	Id illud.
but he knew little about this.	sed parum de hoc sciebat.
Not much.	Non multum.
I'll say it again.	Dicam iterum.
I don't think bad in itself.	In se malum non puto.
You can't stop this.	Non potes hoc prohibere.
just one lucky one.	Unus iustus est felix.
looked good.	Vidit bona.
i think that's what it is about.	Puto id quod est de.
It's talking to you that makes me sick.	Tibi suus loquitur qui me male facit.
Do as much as you can.	Fac quantum potes.
he was not good.	non erat bonus.
It seems that I am ready.	Videtur quod paratus sum.
Not even that scared.	Ne illud quidem, quod vix.
He refused to speak with us.	Noluit nobiscum loqui.
I saw.	Vidi.
I don't even know what to say.	Ne quid dicam ne novi.
The first time he understood.	Primum intellexit.
She should stay at home often.	Illa saepe domi manere debet.
It will not be so. 	Sic non erit. 
He speaks.	Ille loquitur.
He wanted me to stay.	Me manere voluit.
That's a great big thing.	Ut id magna magna.
If you're not sure, don't do it.	Si non es certus, ne facias.
Don't play with him.	Noli ludere cum eo.
What was the need?	Quid opus erat.
It was a good day.	Bene erat dies.
I've been here.	Fui hic.
But enough is enough.	Sed satis est satis.
When he is good, he is really good.	Cum bonus est, vere bonus est.
That's what I think.	Id puto.
Not good, but great.	Non bona, sed magna.
Maybe it was nothing.	Aliquam erat nisi.
But he could not do it himself.	Sed ipse facere non potuit.
let it be to him.	Sit ei.
The day is before you.	Dies est ante te.
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum est.
They are too big.	Nimis magna sunt.
But not at all.	Sed non nulla.
The latest one was from.	Aliquam quis dictum ex.
He seemed to see everything.	Videbatur omnia videre.
He came alone.	solus venit.
Now you can talk to him about what you need.	Nunc cum eo loqui potes de eo quod tibi opus est.
I don't know what, exactly.	Nescio quid, prorsus.
I thought where to go.	Cogitavi ubi ire.
It was not better.	Melius non erat.
But he has some questions.	Sed habet aliquam quaestionem.
It was much better.	Multo erat melius.
I guess he's never done it.	Suspicor eum nunquam fecisse.
Probably better in this way.	Probabile melius hoc modo.
He does very well.	Optime facit.
You're just getting it started.	Iustus questus eam incepit tibi.
I don't know where it is.	Nescio ubi sit.
But it is not mine.	Sed non est mea.
Not too loud.	Non etiam magna.
But not as it was.	Sed non ut erat.
I did it again.	Iterum feci.
Well you know about it.	Bene scis de illo.
But see.	Sed vide.
Truly	Vere.
He wants to do it in advance.	In id ante velit.
Want to see what I like?	Vis videre quid simile?
It's a journey.	Est iter.
Do whatever you like.	Facere quod libet.
And with someone who.	Et cum aliquis qui.
Who like to be great.	Magna quis similis ut.
There must be a plan.	Necesse est esse consilium.
I guess everything could be done.	Suspicor omnia posse.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
He always does.	Semper facit.
he did this work.	hoc opus fecit.
What do you think he did.	Putasne quid fecerit.
I really don't want to see the book again.	Ego vere librum iterum videre nolo.
I have to live and be well.	Non habeo vivere et bene esse.
There is someone who would like to talk to you.	Est aliquis, qui tecum loqui vellem.
But not as great as that.	Sed nec magna quam.
But this cannot be enough.	Sed hoc satis esse non potest.
Maybe you are the same.	Tu fortasse ipse.
I know a lot.	multum scio.
i have work-class.	habeo opus, genus.
Very, very, very much.	Valde, valde, valde.
Here, no.	Hic, nulla.
I know enough.	Satis scio.
if you can help me.	si potes auxilium.
He could come to her soon enough.	Suo satis cito venire posset.
But that's one thing.	Id sed unum.
He was always there.	Semper erat.
No one saw her.	Nemo eam vidit.
To always be in me.	Ut semper in me.
It was some or something.	Aliquam vel aliquam erat.
All in all, he did it.	Omnino fecit.
We can do something about it.	Aliquid de eo facere possumus.
Not well.	Nec bene.
This is nothing new.	Hoc nihil novi est.
No one seems to come like this.	Nemo sic venire videtur.
I didn't think so.	Non putabam.
But in was out.	Sed in erat ex.
Not to speak, but only to see.	Non loqui, sed solum videre.
By U.S.	A nobis.
That's what's going to happen.	Id futurum.
There is nothing there for us.	Nihil ibi nobis est.
So it is.	Ita est.
You can truly	Vere potes.
This may or may not be good.	Hoc sit vel non sit bonum.
There was none in it.	Nulla in erat.
The job has not been done correctly.	Officium non recte factum est.
I'm sorry, but .	Paenitet, sed .
I have nothing, I know nothing.	nihil habeo, nihil novi.
If not, no time.	Nisi, tempus non.
But that's not enough.	Sed id non satis.
And you have very good things.	Et habes valde bona.
There was no time in it.	In nec tempus erat.
There's a lot of work.	Non multum opus est.
I thought you wanted it.	Putabam te id velle.
not on his own.	non suo.
This fact is often forgotten.	Hoc factum saepe oblitus est.
It seemed at last to be.	Videbatur tandem fieri.
Maybe it's correct.	Fortasse recte est.
There is nothing there.	Nihil est ibi.
I'm going to be okay.	Eo esse bene.
He must think about it.	Debet cogitare de eo.
Maybe that's some save.	Aliquam id aliquam nisi.
That's not him.	Ut non est ipsum.
But it is one thing.	Sed aliud est.
You know much about me, boy, but not enough.	Scis multa de me, puer, sed non satis.
Probably enough.	Satis probabiliter.
You can do this.	Sic hoc facere potes.
You need to talk to me.	Mihi debes dicere.
I didn't think it was enough.	Non putavit satis esse.
He gave him an apple.	Malum ei dedit.
Do it in your school.	Fac in schola tua.
He didn't want his money.	Pecuniam suam noluit.
I am busy this morning.	Hoc mane occupatus sum.
But it is not very important to say.	Sed non valde magna dicere.
He did not understand.	Non intellexit.
Unable to do this.	Posse facere id.
Time was time.	Tempus erat tempus.
He said he will try to work.	Probabile opus esse dixit.
There was need for him, and there he wanted it.	Ibi ei opus erat, et ibi eam vellet.
I know it's there.	Novi est ibi.
I just don't believe you're ready to give up on him.	Modo non credo paratus es dare in eum.
He ate hardly anything.	Vix quicquam comedit.
I certainly wasn't.	Ego certe non eram.
I will never say it.	Dicam numquam mea.
and it is hard to believe the truth.	et vix credere verum est.
It was not about this.	Hac non erat.
This was the plan.	Hoc consilium fuit.
But but only what.	Sed sed nisi quam.
It's too early.	Nimis mane est.
This was easy.	Facile hoc fuit.
This is different.	Hoc aliud est.
That can't be true!	Quod verum esse non potest!
It could be done.	Fieri potuit.
He wanted us to enjoy it.	Habere nos voluit.
But it's too late.	Sed nimis sero est.
This is now about me and you.	Hoc nunc de me et te.
so please.	ut hoc placet.
Or not by yourself.	Vel non per te ipsum.
You can help me here.	Hic me adiuvare potes.
He has it there.	Habet ibi.
you have enough.	satis habes.
And you are here.	Et tu hic es.
He has no name.	Nomen non habet.
I see it for sure.	Id certe video.
Tomorrow in no time please.	Cras in nulla velit.
i've never seen anything like it.	numquam quicquam simile vidi.
It will take time.	Tempus non erit accipere.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I'm not sure he would do it.	Certus sum non facturum esse.
More than everything I wanted.	Plus quam omnia volui.
Never talk to you again.	Numquam iterum tecum loqui.
Do what you have.	Fac quod habes.
It is still true today.	Hodie verum adhuc est.
This is not true.	Hoc non est verum.
But he cannot do this; for by this he wills to be seen.	Sed hoc non potest: per hoc enim vult videri.
Which is not true now.	Quod iam verum non est.
Not looking now, he said.	Non nunc, vultus, dixit.
Now it is gonna be great.	Nunc sit amet magna.
If she could not have it.	Si eam habere non posset.
I'm here for the first time.	Hic primum sum.
That's okay.	Quod bene.
They are not good enough.	Non sunt satis.
I wanted to understand.	intelligere volui.
He went, he went away.	Abiit, abiit.
Now not him.	Iam non ipsum.
I have seen myself.	Ego ipse vidi.
Certainly I wouldn't say it.	Certe non vellem dicere.
At length he was able to deal with the situation.	Res tandem agere potuit.
It was the first time for me.	Primum mihi fuit.
I truly am.	Vere vere sum.
What he did was good.	Bonum erat quod fecit.
HE DID IT.	FECIT EAM.
He knows you're coming.	Scit te venire.
And I said to him what is wrong.	Et dixi ei quid mali est.
Maybe or some other than that.	Aliquam vel aliquam quam.
Not one man.	Non unus homo.
At last he came to me.	Tandem venit ad me.
Maybe that's it.	Aliquam id est est.
It is the same with everyone.	Idem est apud omnes.
Not enough to speak.	Parum loqui.
he was ready.	paratus erat.
I don't know how.	Nescio quomodo.
Not you and you.	Non tibi et tibi.
But it is not.	Sed non est est.
What do you mean.	Quid vis id.
We can't say it, not us.	Non possumus dicere, non nobis.
But I suspect that I was.	Suspicor autem me fuisse.
That's what he was doing.	Id faceret.
You know how you can.	Scis quomodo potes.
I told him nothing happened.	Nihil ei dixi factum.
After him	Post eum.
Nothing was to be done.	Nihil erat faciendum.
For he wishes this to be done.	Hoc enim vult fieri.
It was not too late.	Sero non erat.
I don't know how you asked about me.	Nescio quomodo de me quaesivit.
Too easy.	Nimis facile.
not nothing.	Non nihil.
Tell him what he means.	Dic quid sibi velit.
Appreciate your help!	Bene tuum auxilium!.
Which is better.	Quod melius est.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
I wish I had been so long.	Tam diu vellem.
Nothing was said except that.	Nulla id dictum nisi.
He didn't know if he could do it.	Nesciebat si posset facere.
It's almost there now.	Fere ibi nunc.
There is.	Ibi est.
But we are a little before.	Sed paulo ante nos sumus.
And probably rightly he knew it.	Et verisimiliter recte sciebat.
Now it seemed that this was not going to happen.	Id nunc non futurum videbatur.
Not what he wanted here.	Non quod hic vellet.
he did all things.	omnia fecit.
It was a good time.	Erat tempus bonum.
With her, somehow, she was not.	Cum illa, nescio quo modo, non erat.
That's what he or she wants.	Ut vel velit enim.
there was so much to do.	tantum erat facere.
It is bad.	Malum est.
There is definitely something wrong.	Certum est aliquid mali.
I know you by and by.	Novi te per et per.
Appreciate your help and support.	Bene tuum auxilium et auxilium.
i feel so for you.	ego sic sentio tibi.
But he did not stay there.	Sed non ibi manere.
Never do it yourself now.	Numquam id ipsum nunc.
I want you to stay here with me.	Volo te hic apud me manere.
We can do bad things for you.	Malum tibi facere possumus.
How in him.	Quam in illo.
You are not there.	Non ibi.
It was pretty good.	Erat satis bona.
Nothing more to do.	Nihil amplius facere.
You can't do this much.	Hoc facere non multum potes.
But you are mine.	Sed tu meus es.
But even here.	Sed vel hic.
Now there was some one.	Nunc quis aliquam erat.
Right here.	Hic, recte.
This is just another.	Hoc modo est aliud.
It's time for nothing.	Aliquam in nulla.
I am nothing now.	Nihil nunc sum.
How and how is it.	Ut et quam est.
First, it will not be the first time.	Primum, non erit primum.
He is the same.	Ipse est.
he himself said.	ipse dixit.
Someone's talking to her father.	Pater suus aliquis loquitur.
Yes, it was.	Etiam, erat.
Not enough everything.	Non satis omnia.
I just want her as well.	EGO iustus volo eam ut bene.
He does nothing.	Nihil facit.
Who knows how to speak.	Qui nescit loqui.
This seems to be his first video.	Videtur hoc primum eius esse video.
That is not good.	Quod non est bonum.
He understood me.	Intellexit me.
It was something else.	Aliud erat.
But not only that.	Sed non nisi quam.
He was going to talk to him.	Dicere ei erat.
Soon, it will be.	Mox, erit.
I did not know what it was.	nesciebam quid esset.
It's not very much.	Non satis est valde.
You have done well, boy.	Bene fecisti, puer.
And there is another.	Et aliud est.
Not just not at the same time.	Non solum non simul.
I have tried.	Conatus sum.
But it is not so.	Sed non ita est.
What seems to have happened.	Quod factum videtur.
He knows exactly why.	Prorsus scit cur.
All from him	Ex eo omnes .
He is not a good man.	Non est vir bonus.
There's one thing for you.	Aliud ibi pro.
I heard what you did.	Audivi quid fecisti.
See if you have any of it.	Vide si quid ex eo.
But not much has been said.	Sed non multum dictum est.
To anyone.	Ut quis.
This work has not yet been done.	Id opus nondum factum est.
badly, you know.	male, scis.
It was true, and it was not true.	Verum erat et non erat verum.
Truly, truly.	Vere, vere.
So happy to see you!	Tam felix te videre!
But he did not give.	Sed non dedit.
It's gonna help me a lot.	Non amet me adiuvet multum.
He says to him.	Dicit ei.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
It is true.	Verum est.
The thing was, if he could, he did not know.	Res erat, si posset, nesciebat.
It was very good.	Fuit valde bonus.
It is necessary to know.	Scire necesse est.
All right, tomorrow morning.	Recte, cras mane.
I am ready for everything.	Paratus sum ad omnia.
None in this article.	Nulla in dictum ipsum.
It was certainly among us.	In nobis certe fuit.
I would like to do this kind.	Vellem id genus.
That will tell you a lot.	Quod tibi multum dicam.
Now	Nunc.
I know you can't help yourself.	Scio te ipsum adiuvare non potes.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
Help today.	Auxilium hodie.
That was good.	Quod erat bonum.
I have no name yet.	Nondum nomen habeo.
That can be enough.	Id satis fieri potest.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
I know there is more than that.	Novi plus est quam illud.
Nor is it difficult to see that it is so.	Nec difficile est videre quod ita sit.
Where you wanna be.	Ubi esse habes.
I just started to go for it.	Modo incepit ire pro eo.
For truly it was.	Vere enim erat.
I told you that you were a wife.	Uxorem tibi dixi esse te.
I have never heard of him.	numquam ab eo audivi.
Certainly rightly so.	Certe recte.
I really like him.	Ego vere similis ei.
Maybe you are the same.	Tu fortasse ipse.
Always before that.	Semper ante id.
But he was not there.	Sed non erat enim.
if indeed you still want us.	si quidem adhuc vis nobis.
You did that.	Fecisti id.
He came to live with us.	Venit nobiscum vivere.
But you better do this correctly.	Sed tu melius hoc recte.
Maybe not always for you.	Aliquam non semper enim.
They're very good.	Sunt valde bona.
But he did not say.	Sed non dixit.
I see for sure.	Video certe.
I have done well.	bene feci.
This is to be yourself and be sure.	Hoc est esse te et esse certus.
To sit.	Ut sit.
He knew better than to be there for him.	Melius sciebat ibi esse ei.
It just seemed like it.	Similis modo videbatur.
This is the question.	Haec quaestio est.
This is a long time ago.	Haec diu ante.
I will not say.	Non dicam.
No one is sure.	Nemo est certus.
We don't like it.	Non placet nobis.
I can't tell you much.	Non possum tibi multa dicere.
And rightly indeed.	Et recte quidem.
If anyone can do it, he can.	Si quis id facere potest, potest.
Very, great.	Ipsum, magna.
Or it may be possible, but not tonight.	Vel potest fortasse, sed non hac nocte.
That he could do well.	Quod bene potuit.
nor was there anything else which was seen.	nec aliud erat quod videbatur.
But you cannot accept this.	Sed hoc non potes accipere.
He does not come.	non venit.
You know it too.	Scis etiam.
I wanted him better.	Melius eum volui.
Or yes but no in you.	Vel etiam sed nulla in te.
This was not good.	Hoc non erat bonum.
It is a journey.	Iter est.
He can speak, but not speak.	Loqui potest, sed non loqui.
And now he's here again.	Et nunc hic iterum est.
To wish before.	Ut velit ante.
If a man saw, it was not certain.	Si homo vidit, certum non erat.
I've never done this.	Nunquam feci hoc.
I'll tell him.	Dicam eum.
he would not come.	venire noluit.
You are the only one who can speak.	Solus es qui dicere potes.
it is not easy.	non facile.
He could do nothing from this.	Nihil ex hac facere potuit.
I like? 	Mihi placet?
he says.	dicit.
He did this in the morning.	Mane hoc fecit.
If any one has seen yet.	Si quis adhuc vidit.
He could do everything, but not well.	Potuit omnia, sed non bene.
Maybe one from him.	Aliquam quis ex ipsum.
Just listen for you.	Te solum audire pro.
I wanted to do it.	facere volui.
He didn't want to talk anymore.	Noluit amplius loqui.
No one knew.	Nemo sciebat.
I see you coming and going.	Video te venire et ire.
He saw everything at once.	Vidit omnia simul.
You don't have to talk to me.	Loqui de me non habes.
It is probable.	Probabile est.
That certainly was.	Quod certe fuit.
I wonder if we're anything like that.	Miror si quid simile sumus.
But that was not a problem.	Sed id non erat quaestio.
Here he came, here he came, he is.	Hic venit, hic venit, hic est.
We have both.	Utrumque habemus.
It's too late.	Non est nimium sero.
There is still work.	Adhuc opus est.
But who wants time.	Sed quis tempus velit.
Let no one help you.	Nemo te adiuvet.
Don't listen yet.	Noli audire tamen.
It's still there.	Is adhuc est.
And so he did.	Et sic fecit.
That's how long you have.	Id quam diu habes.
but it was too much.	sed nimis erat.
If ever.	Si umquam.
To believe in themselves.	Credere sibi.
But he did not know what he was going to do.	Nesciebat tamen quid facturus esset.
Did he do the right thing? 	Fecit rem recte?
I don't want to do anything about it.	Nolo aliquid de illo facere.
He doesn't know what he's thinking.	Nescit quid cogitat.
You are the one.	Tu ille.
It was not by me yet.	Per me adhuc non erat.
Soon enough, he got what he wanted.	Satis cito, obtinuit quod voluit.
More than you think.	Plus quam cogitas.
I don't feel good at the moment.	Non sentio bonum tempore.
He was not prepared for that.	Erat paratus qui.
He was a dog.	canis erat.
He didn't do anything much.	Non multum aliquid fecit.
But he never seemed sufficient.	Sed ipse satis numquam videbatur.
That's what I want to do for you.	Quid est quod vis ut faciam tibi.
Nor should it be.	Nec debet.
I will make breakfast.	Prandium faciam.
Do well.	Fac bene.
Don't get me wrong here.	Ne me male, hic.
That's the plan.	Id consilium.
and nothing can.	et nihil potest.
He speaks of us.	De nobis loquitur.
You need to talk to yourself if you don't have help.	Dicere tibi debes si auxilium non habes.
That was great.	Erat id magna.
This is your.	Tuum est.
I was just thinking about you yesterday.	Ego iustus cogitas te heri.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
Stay where you need to be.	Ubi manere opus erat.
His father was a good man.	Pater eius vir bonus erat.
I just don't think of it.	Non solum non cogitare eam.
Not much, but something.	Non multum, sed aliquid.
Go see, see.	Ire vide vide.
Now it was.	Nunc erat.
And nothing in him.	Et nihil in eum.
It's time to go there.	Aliquam ut nulla est.
Nor can I.	Nec possum.
No one ever said.	Nemo umquam.
Men! 	Homines!
Finally we have it.	Tandem habemus eam.
If you do, you know what you've done.	Si feceris, scis quid feceris.
I didn't want to think any more.	Nolui amplius cogitare.
My dog ​​eats better than a lot of people.	Canis meus melius quam multum homines comedit.
Which is that.	Quod est illud.
He'd like it again.	Ipse iterum velis.
I have a plan and I just need it.	Habeo consilium, et ut modo opus sit.
Which one.	Quod quis.
He also was not himself.	Etiam non ipsum erat.
I have one here.	Habeo unum hic.
I saw him only yesterday.	eum solum heri vidi.
But he saw nothing.	Sed nihil vidit.
Nothing is better.	Nihil est melius.
This was done this year.	Hoc factum est hoc anno.
Nothing was said, nothing was done.	Nihil dictum, nihil factum.
He wanted nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem voluit.
but he did so.	sed ita fecit.
It's going to be better for us than for us.	Melius nobis futurum est ut nobis.
He gave you good advice.	Bonum consilium dedit tibi.
Maybe that was great.	Aliquam id magna erat.
And he does well.	Et bene facit.
You know .	Scis .
They are.	Sunt.
Maybe not.	Fortasse non.
He could not say anything.	Non potuit dicere quicquam.
And that was done.	Id autem factum est.
It is possible, however.	Fieri tamen potest.
The name is the name.	Nomen est nomen.
Never say anything else.	Nunquam aliud.
It is one thing.	Aliud est.
Well maybe not.	Bene fortasse.
I just did it.	Modo illud fecisti.
I will tell him everything.	Dicam ei omnia.
It is certain.	Certus est.
He's the one who told me to do this.	Ille est qui dixit mihi hoc facere.
I certainly need it.	Mihi certe opus est.
I need something else for you.	Aliud mihi opus est tibi.
If anyone could help him, he certainly could.	Si quis eum adiuvare posset, certe posset.
This is not so.	Hoc non ita est.
Do it if you want.	Fac si vis.
If it was not, it will be.	Si non fuit, erit.
I have nothing.	Habeo quod.
This is not a class, however.	Hoc genus non est, sed.
.	, '.
This is always the case.	Haec semper.
This alone.	Hoc solum.
You do not do all that you can.	Non facis omnia quae potes.
I just tried it and it seems to work.	Modo conatus est et videtur opus.
We're here for something else.	Hic aliud sumus.
One after one.	Unus post unum.
Nothing else for me.	Nihil aliud mihi.
He did not know what was wrong.	Nesciebat id malum esse.
Not much has been said.	Non multum dictum est.
You don't need anything to do?	Non opus est tibi aliquid facere!
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
I love really sorry.	Amo vere paenitet.
I was not at home.	Non eram domi.
It looks really good on him.	Is vultus vere bonus est ei.
I just look after you.	Non solum vultus post te.
Same thing, really.	Idem, vere.
He is not looking at her.	Is eam non spectat.
It is difficult to see.	Difficile est videre.
I feel pretty lucky.	Satis felix sentio.
I don't want you here.	Nolo hic te.
Don't do this too hard.	Noli hoc difficile facere.
I know how he thinks.	Scio quomodo cogitat.
It is not a plan.	Non consilium.
Why are we here.	Cur hic sumus.
These things he said thus.	Haec ita dixit.
It is not enough to say.	Non satis est dicere.
I also don't think you need that.	Ego quoque non puto opus esse.
I can do better than I can.	Melius possum facere quam potest .
I had many things to say.	Multa habui dicere.
It is true, and you know it.	Verum est, et scis.
Sorry for the long post.	Nos paenitet diu post.
Here's someone who can help you.	Hic est aliquis qui te adiuvet.
However, it's definitely a job.	Tamen certum est illud officium.
You have me?	Habes me?.
Maybe it was or was.	Aliquam vel erat erat.
But we cannot see.	Sed videre non possumus.
Yes, but it was always.	Etiam sed semper erat.
No one knew exactly what would happen.	Nemo prorsus quid futurum esset sciebat.
Maybe you can.	Fortasse potest.
Not long now.	Non diu nunc.
If not you probably don't need it.	Si non probabiliter, non opus est tibi.
He knows you.	Scit te.
for truly.	vere enim.
To sit.	Ut sit.
I know him.	Scio eum.
Well it wasn't.	Bene non fuit.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
So be prepared to go.	Sic paratus erit ire.
Certainly not, certainly.	Non certe, certe.
You know what you mean.	Scis quid vis.
Maybe he still does.	Fortasse adhuc facit.
But not enough.	Sed non satis.
I truly believe now.	Vere credo nunc.
I have only seen you.	Tantum te vidi.
It was where he wanted to be.	Erat ubi esse voluit.
I am very doubtful of that fact.	Valde dubito id quidem.
That's longer.	Quod diutius.
I hope you're doing the same.	Spero te facere idem.
I'm pretty sure he's not doing it.	Satis certo scio ille id non facere.
I've been there before.	Ibi ante fui.
I'm not really here.	Hic non sum vere.
But also for him.	Sed et ipsum enim.
But I can't.	Sed non possum.
But not before him.	Sed non ante ipsum.
It is a day in the morning.	Dies mane est.
I don't want to see this ever.	Nolo hoc semper videre.
I don't want to be.	Nolo esse.
You're so good to us.	Tam bonus es nobis.
Talk to someone.	Loqui cum aliquo.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Let me just do anything else for you.	Fac me modo aliud tibi.
And you are good.	Et tu bonus es.
But not at all.	Sed non nulla.
That was something.	Quod erat aliquid.
It was exactly what I had to do.	Prorsus quid faciendum esset.
I just said.	Modo dictum est.
I thought what I was going to do.	Putavi quid facturus esset.
Now is the time enough.	Iam satis tempus est.
What else could have been done.	Quid aliud fieri potuit.
For now	Nunc enim.
There's no need to be anything else.	Nihil aliud ibi opus esse.
Not you now.	Nec te nunc.
It was so.	Ita erat.
You'd better do nothing.	Nihil melius velis.
I made the decision to go with this.	Ire hoc consilium feci.
yes who is it.	Etiam quis est.
He was in there.	Erat in ibi.
We are like nothing else.	Sicut aliud sumus.
At that time it was great.	In id tempus magna.
I did not say.	Non dixi.
You're a great question right now.	Es magna quaestio nunc.
That was the same thing.	Id ipsum erat.
But this is not here.	Sed hoc non est hic.
He could not do it.	Potuit facere.
Now in the article.	Nunc in dictum est.
No one yet knows.	Nemo tamen nescit.
This is my journey now.	Hic nunc iter est.
I'm all over.	Im totum in.
He didn't know what to do.	Nesciebat quid faceret.
And yet.	Et tamen.
We have a plan.	Consilium habemus.
What you've done.	Quod feceris.
I think it's true.	Puto verum esse.
If you don't have it, you can't understand.	Si non habes, non potes intelligere.
The whole thing has to do.	Totum habet ad.
Tomorrow was in him.	Cras in ipsum erat.
There is none, none.	Nulla est, nulla.
If he does, he can win.	Si fecerit, vincere potest.
Maybe something similar happened here.	Forte simile quid hic factum est.
He does well.	Bene facit.
I don't like it enough.	Non satis tibi placet.
It was good, but still a little.	Bonum erat, sed adhuc parum.
It is certain that you will be.	Certum est te futurum esse.
No one really.	Nemo vere.
It's pretty good.	Satis bene est.
I could never stop.	numquam prohibere potui.
That's all up to you.	Id est totum ad vos.
Not enough is enough.	Parum satis est.
I see that you can do it.	Video te facere posse.
To do that.	Facere ut.
I believe it can be done.	Credo fieri posse.
It was good not to find out.	Bonum erat non invenire.
He was not even sure if he could say anything.	Ne certe quidem erat si quicquam dicere posset.
He did not.	Non fecit.
It has been too long.	Nimis diu fuit.
And he knew it.	Sciebat autem.
Good to see you.	Bene te videre.
That's how it is.	Id ut est.
That's some great things.	Ut id aliquam magna.
First, this is not true.	Primum, hoc verum non est.
It could be like this.	Posset sic.
He knew that he could say nothing.	Sciebat se posse nihil dicere.
I can't do anything for you.	Non possum tibi aliquid facere.
I think it is different.	aliud esse puto.
Really you don't.	Vere non facis.
I hope to hear from you again.	Spero a te audire iterum.
I know this to be true.	Scio hoc verum esse.
What, he did not know.	Quid, nesciebat.
Well if I could stay.	Bene, si manere posset.
It was probably there.	Verisimile ibi fuit.
I do the same.	Idem ego.
But it is not for us.	Sed non est nobis.
At the same time he did not know what he was doing.	Simul autem nesciebat quid faceret.
Not enough advice.	Parum consilium.
He said not enough.	Parum dixit.
I could not understand.	Intelligere non potui.
She's talking to me.	Illa mecum loquitur.
That's what I wanted to do about everything you think.	Id volui facere fere omnia, quae cogitas.
That's just good.	Sic tantum bonum.
He knows me too well.	Me nimium bene novit.
Is there something else? 	Estne aliquid aliud?
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
I haven't seen too much too much.	Nimium non vidi nimium.
It is good.	Bonum est.
It's mine, you know.	Meum est, scis.
I don't like it here.	Non placet hic.
could it be something else?	an aliquid aliud esse potuit?
It is difficult to see.	Difficile est videre.
There's always nothing to do.	Nulla semper nec velit.
Every morning at the office.	Omnes mane ad officium.
I hope you understand what I'm saying.	Spero te intelligere quid dicam.
Maybe he knows something about it.	Fortasse scit aliquid de eo.
That's wrong and not good.	Quod mali est et non bene.
I don't even know mine.	Nescio quidem meum.
I don't mean to you.	Non sit tibi.
That's right, that's right.	SIC, SIC.
and you know.	et scis.
He is now here.	Hic nunc est.
Just like me.	Modo mihi.
She just didn't tell me.	Illa iustus non indicavit mihi.
I am sure it ought to be.	Certus sum esse debere.
This has been done very well.	Hoc optime factum est.
It's time to say nothing.	Aliquam dictum nisi enim.
I do as a.	facio ut a.
I just want you to go.	Ego iustus volo te ire.
No one wants nothing.	Nulla a nulla velit.
Now, let it be.	Modo, sit.
To be honest from zero.	Ut sit amet ex nulla.
But this is something new.	Sed hoc aliquid novi est.
He had his day.	Is diem suum habuit.
It is better to do.	Melius est hoc facere.
You said it to me.	Tu mihi dixisti.
I couldn't find one at a time.	Unum in tempore invenire non potui.
She certainly was prepared.	Is certe paratus erat illa.
The whole plan.	Totum consilium.
I like it a lot.	Multum mihi placet.
He wants to do this himself.	Hoc ipsum facere vult.
Who is this man?	Quis est hic homo ?
and this is where we are.	et hoc est ubi nos sumus.
we have enough.	satis habemus.
It is a great thing.	Res magna est.
And it has been said.	Sed et dictum est.
I don't know what will happen.	quid futurum sit nescio.
I have nothing to say to him.	Dicere ei non habeo.
This one is true.	Hoc unum verum est.
I'll get one soon.	Faciam ut cito unum.
Only, that's what I need.	Tantum, id est quod opus est.
Better here than out.	Melius hic quam ex.
This seems to be true.	Hoc verum esse videtur.
It was really about something.	Vere erat de aliquo.
To do that.	Facere ut.
Or perhaps not.	Vel fortasse non.
It was late yesterday.	Erat heri sero.
So it is.	Ita est.
That's what the dog is.	Id quod canis est.
We are.	Sumus.
So no one can see you.	Ita nemo te videre potest.
It is true.	Verum est.
I told her how she could do it and she did it.	Dixi ei quomodo posset facere et fecit.
He should not.	Non debet.
This is not correct.	Hoc non recte.
We have nothing to do with him.	Nihil nobis cum illo.
Not from this yet.	Non ab hoc tamen.
For he was.	Erat enim.
I have done this yet.	Hoc adhuc feci.
I like a dog.	Canem mihi placet.
It's not like it.	Hoc non est simile ei.
I'm not getting it.	Im 'non questus est.
It's time to save it.	Aliquam ut nisi erat.
Nothing pleases me.	Nihil placet.
I love you now and perhaps always.	Nunc te amo, et fortasse semper.
I know rightly.	recte scio.
That is no great.	Id est, nulla magna.
And now it was his.	Et nunc eius fuit.
You need to think about it.	De illo debes cogitare.
What does he do?	Quid agit hoc?
I want to say something.	Volo aliquid dicere.
That man cannot come hither for work.	Non potest homo ille huc venire opus.
I'm very sorry.	Im valde.
Well, that's fine.	Bene, Bene.
I feel better than I can see.	Sentio melius videre possum.
I said nothing to him.	Nihil ei dixi.
Are you sure?	Es certus?.
What does he want from us?	Quid vult a nobis?
I'm not really sure what this meant.	Ego vere certus sum quid hoc esset.
It is important for him.	Aliquam sit amet enim ipsum.
But he doesn't want us either.	Sed vel nobis non velit.
No one said no.	Non dixit nemo.
It is a good name.	Bonum nomen est.
But that's the same thing.	Sed ut id ipsum.
I really want to do this.	Vere hoc facere volo.
You can't do it.	Facere non potes.
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
I will tell you that you have said so.	Dicam te ita dixisse.
You see something.	Tu aliquid vide.
Tell me one thing.	Dic mihi unum.
Maybe you know better than anyone who did it before.	Forsitan melius quam scis, quis ante fecerit.
Well that's great.	Bene id et magna.
To-morrow was by some.	Cras a aliquam erat.
That's not going to happen.	Quod non futurum est.
And as it was done.	Et sicut factum est.
That is not a bad thing to do.	Quod non est malum facere.
I can't believe it.	Credere non possum.
If you get what you want it can be done for sure.	Si id quod vis fieri certe potest.
It was already late for work.	Iam sero opus erat.
It's too easy.	Nimis facile est.
He left the room.	Cubiculum reliquit.
And you perhaps.	Et tu fortasse.
There was no problem.	Quaestio non fuit.
I haven't seen it yet.	Adhuc non vidi cum.
But one thing is certain.	Unum tamen certum est.
They are truly.	Sunt vere.
It should be done and it should be done.	Fieri et debet.
It would be great to hear from you.	Magna esset a te audire.
It is not.	Non sit.
-It's not an easy time.	-Non hoc tempore facile.
I have it too.	Habeo etiam.
Yep really buy one guy.	Vidi vere emere unum guy.
This has not been done.	Hoc non est factum.
He was with him.	Erat cum ipsum.
I'm glad she's with me.	Gaudeo illa mecum.
Yes, that was the game.	Etiam id erat velit.
But it is not a bad thing.	Sed non malum.
I don't have time to go.	Non tempus ut.
I want you with me.	Te mecum volo.
He made.	Fecit.
Tomorrow is only out.	Cras non nisi ex.
It is a great thing.	Res magna est.
the kind I wanted.	genus volui.
I'll tell you something else.	Dicam aliud.
But he does not say.	Sed non dicit.
Or he thought.	Vel putavit.
Certainly you don't have.	Certe non habes.
But this too.	Sed hoc quoque.
It was too much for me.	Mihi nimium fuit.
You.	Vos.
but one.	sed unum.
You can see through.	Per te videre potes.
He made me.	Fecit me.
But yes it was.	Etiam sed erat.
He did not do this.	Hoc facere non fecit.
Even not before him.	Etiam nec ipsum ante.
You might see it there.	Fortasse vide ibi.
There is a plan.	Est consilium.
It's not that difficult to understand.	Non id quod difficile est intelligere.
Tell me who did this.	Dic mihi quis hoc fecerit.
Nothing but.	Nihil nisi.
I hope that will be true for you.	Spero quod tibi verum erit.
Or perhaps he could not.	Vel fortasse non potuit.
No by now.	Nulla a nunc.
But little else.	Sed parum aliud.
He knows it too.	Novit quoque.
i need to go.	opus erit mihi ire.
This should not be done.	Hoc fieri non debet.
I know you're with me.	Scio te nimium mecum esse.
By the time	Ad tempus.
Too hard to believe.	Nimis difficile credo.
This is not correct.	Hoc non recte.
It can be.	Potest esse.
Not when you think.	Non cum cogitas.
If possible.	Si fieri potest.
They are great.	Magna sunt.
I didn't say so now.	Non dixi modo.
But this journey was not easy.	Sed hoc iter facile non esset.
Why not.	Cur non.
See if there is need.	Vide si opus sit.
I am.	Ego sum.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
Maybe even this same thing.	Forsitan et hoc ipsum.
I want more time.	Plus volo tempus.
You know where it is here.	Hic ubi sit scis.
But there was nothing new.	Sed non erat aliquid novi.
I am astonished at that.	Miror quod.
You have thirty.	Habes triginta.
But there is need.	Sed opus est.
He didn't want to stop this.	Noluit hoc prohibere.
not not.	ne non.
It was done before that time.	Factum est ante id tempus.
If not, you are not.	Si non, non es.
i can never be.	numquam esse possum.
i love both.	utrumque amo.
I'm trying to find a home.	Im 'conatur domum invenire.
You can talk through.	Per potes dicere.
they are still with me.	adhuc mecum sunt;
But I can't find anything about it.	Sed aliquid de eo invenire non possum.
Me too.	Me quoque.
here and here.	hic et hic.
This is enough.	Hoc satis est.
This has to be a journey.	Hoc habet esse iter.
I know it wasn't much.	Non multum novi fuit.
It will be tonight.	Hac nocte erit.
He said, he told me.	Dixit, ille mihi.
I don't know what to say.	Nescio quid dicam.
It makes you better.	Melius te facit.
Now without me.	Modo sine me.
There is no time to love yourself.	Nulla sit amet tempus ipsum.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
Probably not working for you.	Verisimile non opus est tibi.
There's nothing wrong with that.	Nihil mali est ibi.
But there is something in it.	Sed in aliquid est.
But either way.	Sed vel ita.
It was to him.	Erat ei.
Now this.	Hic, nunc.
Not to be.	Non esse.
There are also.	Sunt etiam.
It's a matter of some sort.	Est rem aliquam.
From us to you.	A nobis ad te.
It's this time.	Est simul hoc.
He is already here.	Iam hic est.
Today is one day so far so good.	Hodie dies unus, quantum bonum.
Why so?	Quare sic.
he was one today.	unus erat hodie.
He was not happy.	Felix non fuit.
As it was.	Ut esset.
I don't know what to say.	Quid ei dicam nescio.
Maybe it's your job too.	Fortasse hoc quoque tuum facit.
That's a zero.	Ut a nulla erat.
A job, a job.	A officium, officium.
He could do nothing about it.	Nihil de eo potuit.
I thought that would happen.	Putavi fore.
Even who it was.	Etiam quis erat.
I don't know how he knows, but he does.	Nescio quomodo scit, sed facit.
What is the purpose of it?	Quae ad eam rem'.
Not only that day.	Non solum illo die.
That's always the time.	Semper id tempus.
This is fine, though.	Hoc bene, sed.
This really surprises me.	Vere miror hoc.
It was good.	Bonum erat.
More money than you do is a bad thing.	Plus pecuniae, quam facias, malum est.
it was too much.	nimis erat.
Please, please stay with me.	Quaeso, quaeso, mane apud me.
He was not happy about it.	Felix non fuit de illo.
I have.	Habeo.
Be happy with me.	Mecum felix.
I'm glad you have money.	Gaudeo te pecuniam habere.
He wanted this badly.	Hoc male voluit.
I knew better than that.	melius sciebam quam illud.
I know it's possible.	Scio posse.
Maybe too much.	Forte nimium.
It's already morning.	Iam mane est.
I think we're doing pretty well.	Puto nos satis bene facere.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
I haven't heard much.	Non multum audivi.
It is, and yet it is not.	Est, et tamen non est.
I see you have one.	Video te habere unum.
Nothing is wrong.	Nihil est mali.
This will be certain.	Hoc certum erit.
Was that? 	Erat id?
Really don't know what to do.	Vere nescio quid faciam.
Certainly it is evil.	Certe malum est.
See you tomorrow.	Cras te videre.
Where you have all things, but nothing.	Ubi omnia habes, sed nihil.
I really think.	Ego vere cogitare.
It is not so.	Non est ita esse.
But he doesn't want to.	Non vult autem.
What I can't see.	Quod videre non possum.
But there is another thing too.	Sed est aliud quoque.
This is not mine.	Hoc non est meum.
but he could not speak.	sed loqui potuit.
Absolutely no reason why.	Omnino cur.
I'm not even home.	Ego ne domi quidem.
I wonder how his day has gone.	Miror quomodo dies eius abiit.
I have nothing.	nihil habeo.
I never asked before.	Numquam ante quaesivit.
not you too.	Non tu quoque.
Nothing could hinder him.	Nihil prohibere potuit.
But even if it was said only.	Sed vel dictum nisi.
Which he probably does.	Quod probabiliter facit.
I don't want to say this.	Nolo hoc dicere.
And so he did.	Et sic fecit.
Don't say anything.	Noli dicere.
Right the first time.	Recte primum.
Too much for me to do.	Nimium me facere.
This is to give.	Hic est dare.
It's not great.	Etiam non ex magna.
For they are still there.	Sunt enim adhuc ibi.
he has.	habet.
There was no problem.	Quaestio non fuit.
I heard about him.	de eo audivi.
Everything seems to be right now.	Omnia ut nunc videtur.
This will be one thing.	Hoc unum erit.
You are not right.	Non recte.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
That's not how.	Ut non quam.
That's very important to us.	Magna id ipsum nobis.
So make sure to do it.	Sic fac ut faciam.
You have a plan.	Habes consilium.
Can you swim?	Vos natare potest?
This is your.	Tuum est.
Yesterday was that day.	Heri erat dies ille.
No but before him.	Nulla sed ipsum ante.
I am not quite sure how it happened.	Non satis certo scio quomodo acciderit.
It is.	Sic est.
I am certain.	Certum habeo.
The one who told me he could not tell me.	Ille qui dixit mihi nescire me potuit.
Day.	Eo die.
I am getting sick.	Male questus est mihi.
That is.	Id est.
Don't speak now.	Noli nunc dicere.
There's only one.	Nulla solum.
I don't mean you.	Non vult te.
There you are.	Ibi es.
Plus, it's okay for you.	Plus, bene est tibi.
But not even that is enough.	Sed ne haec quidem satis.
Maybe he wasn't here.	Aliquam non erat hic.
You are so happy.	Tam felix es.
Say something you need.	Dic aliquid debes.
This one who did not want him.	Hic qui eum nolebat.
Really, really met you.	Vere, vere occurrit vobis.
That's how fun it was.	Ut sit amet quam erat.
It's already a lot of work today.	Iam multum opus est hodie.
That would be enough.	Quod satis esset.
I guess what is true.	Suspicor quid verum sit.
You do not want.	Non vis.
But not as it was.	Sed non ut erat.
And that's a great thing right now.	Et quod nunc magna res est.
I have scarcely seen.	vix vidi.
Nothing between you and me.	Nihil inter me et te.
But he knew that it was not so.	Sciebat autem non ita se habere.
This day was before us.	Hodie ante nos fuit.
How was this.	Ut erat hoc.
Well, no.	Bene, non est.
Without him he can't win.	Sine illo non potest vincere.
But it was not so.	Sed non erat ut.
Time is talking about now.	Loquitur tempus de nunc.
You'd better do it.	Melius facere velis.
This is certain.	Hoc certum est.
It's hard to see what's wrong.	Difficile est videre quid mali est.
There are people like you.	Sunt homines sicut tu.
But he refused to speak to me.	Noluit loqui nisi mihi.
I know.	Ego scio.
No other than you.	Non aliud quam tu.
He said that he wanted it.	Dixit se id velle.
Absolutely not better.	Omnino non in melius.
He didn't want anything to do with me.	Noluit aliquid facere mecum.
This is going to happen.	Hoc futurum est.
This is not enough.	Hoc non est satis.
Now we have to do this in this way.	Nunc hoc modo nobis faciendum est.
if only you can do it.	si modo id facere potes.
It was a successful affair.	Felix res fuit.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
Not the same thing.	Non id ipsum.
He also has a first name.	Etiam primum nomen habet.
I'm up to.	Sum ad.
He said perhaps.	Dixit fortasse.
I know a wife.	Scio uxorem.
From this .	Ex hoc .
Not that it was necessary.	Non quod necesse fuit.
I wanted to help you.	Volui te adiuvare.
He would do anything.	Facturum aliquid.
I can't think of anything else.	Non possum aliud cogitare.
But not a great time.	Sed non tempus magna.
It can't be, it can't be.	Fieri non potest, non potest esse.
I feel somehow.	Sentio aliquo modo.
This work is still working.	Hoc opus adhuc opus est.
He could not say what it was.	Id quod erat, dicere non potuit.
Not again soon.	Non iterum cito.
Me, this is me.	Me, Hoc me.
But you can always do better.	Melius tamen semper facere potes.
But he doesn't want to say.	Sed non dictum velit.
I think your plan is very good.	Puto consilium tuum valde bonum esse.
Or what it was.	Vel quae erat.
As much as possible.	Tantum, quantum.
I know more than that.	Scio plus esse.
He can see the future.	Futurum videre potest.
To me this is nothing;	Mihi hoc nihil est;
I can't see it.	Illud videre non possum.
It will never be like this.	Numquam sic erit.
But not as much.	Sed non quam.
I wanted to go home.	Domum ire volui.
But yes, there was more than that.	Etiam sed erat quam.
She was so happy.	Tam felix illa fuit.
Maybe it was him.	Aliquam quis erat ipsum.
You want to go.	Vis ut.
If you don't like it, well.	Si tibi non placet, bene.
There are three to one.	Tres ad unum sunt.
I knew this was it.	sciebam hoc erat.
Someone has to say that.	Dicere aliquis habet.
I will say nothing.	Nihil dicam.
I think you could do it better.	Puto te ei bonum facere posse.
It will be.	Erit.
This is certainly true for me.	Hoc certe verum est mihi.
Now he is gone.	Nunc abiit.
i'm happy boy.	Sum felix puer.
I know how busy you are.	Scio quam occupatus sis.
That's how he played it.	Ut id ipsum quam.
But that is.	Sed id est est.
And again he did this.	Et iterum hoc fecit.
Where he is now.	Ubi nunc est.
I don't have to talk to you.	Non habeo tecum loqui.
late for lunch.	Sero ad prandium.
I just get something.	Ego iustus aliquid accipere.
But this is not so today.	Sed hoc non ita est hodie.
Yes they are.	Ita sunt.
That's too bad.	Quod etiam malum.
Or perhaps he didn't want to.	Vel fortasse nolebat.
You are so good!	Tam bene!
I don't want this.	Nolo hoc.
could not find.	Non potuit invenire.
That's what he has.	Id quod habet.
I don't say much.	Non multum dicam.
I have to go.	Habeo ut ad.
you have time.	habes tempus.
You do all these things to me.	Haec omnia mihi facis.
This one is.	Hoc unum est.
But he is not here.	Sed hic non est.
It's not easy for her.	Hoc non est facile ad eam.
It will be fine until morning.	Bene erit usque ad mane.
He is talking to us about this.	De hoc nobis loquitur.
We need to talk.	Loqui nobis opus est.
I don't know who.	Nescio quis.
That was the same thing.	Id ipsum erat.
It was said.	Dictum erat.
He said he was not alone.	Solus ille non se dixit.
only one thing to do.	unum tantum facere.
we can learn.	scire possumus.
I have mine.	Meum habeo.
That's one way to do it.	Id unum iter facere.
not in the afternoon.	Non post meridiem.
Certainly you are thinking.	Certe cogitas.
He knew what he was doing.	Sciebat quid faceret.
If not, you can do it.	Si non est, facere potes.
But if there is.	Sed si est.
And he thought.	Putabat autem.
You must not do this.	Hoc facere non debes.
Or how to do so.	Vel quam id.
It's time for him to do it.	Aliquam id ipsum enim.
Maybe not always.	Aliquam non semper.
Well done.	Bene fecit.
Maybe it's not.	Aliquam nec est.
I have seen it.	Vidi eam.
You are still here.	Adhuc hic es.
i never thought this was bad.	numquam id malum putavi.
Before noon.	Ante meridiem.
No no, no.	Non non, non.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
You'll never do it.	Numquam feceris.
I thought about just saying this for a long time.	Cogitavi de modo diu hoc dicere.
I don't want that.	Nolo illud.
Or a plan.	Vel consilium.
They are not there anymore.	Non sunt amplius.
I can't think of where he is.	Non potest cogitare ubi ille sit.
But he could not think of it.	Sed non potuit cogitare de illo.
Or he does, but does not wish.	Vel facit, sed non velit.
Now that's the same thing.	Nunc id ipsum quam.
It's still there.	Est adhuc ibi.
Not really sure what to do with it.	Non vere quidem quid de certo.
The truth is there.	Verum est ibi.
But later today.	Sed post hodie.
And so it is here.	Et ita est hic.
He could have it.	Potuit habere eam.
He who loves us is here for us.	Qui nos amat, hic nobis est.
I am not by yet, and not by.	Non sum per tamen, et non per.
I do not think.	Non puto.
He wished to be a man, and yet did not.	Homo esse voluit, et tamen non fecit.
He said, you are one.	Dixit, tu unum.
I didn't want anything to do with it.	Nolui aliquid facere cum illo.
He could not.	Non potuit.
For none in none.	Nulla in nulla enim.
You should know this.	Hoc scire debes.
I truly am.	Ego vere sum.
That's where we are.	Id ubi sumus.
I hope that is not true.	Spero quod non est verum.
Everybody has something.	Habet aliquid omnibus.
Or car?	Vel currus?.
He does his whole journey.	Totum iter facit suum.
Say you don't want to.	Dic te non velle.
Look how you do it.	Vide quomodo facias.
He ate everything.	Omnia comedit.
If you want to.	Si vis.
This is what you want.	Is est vis.
Not really good at all.	Non vere bonus est omnino.
Have a day too.	Habere diem quoque.
He knew it was enough.	Scivit satis esse.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
We'll never talk anymore.	Numquam nos amplius loqui.
You can go in.	Ire potes in.
But it is.	Sed est.
Maybe he knows better than himself.	Forsitan melius quam ipse novit.
What's going to happen?	Quid futurum est?
Make me.	Fac me.
They are pretty much the same.	Fere idem sunt.
Do as much as you can on time	Fac quantum potes in tempore
No, he wanted it.	Non, voluit.
I know him.	Novi eum.
I have seen enough.	satis vidi.
I don't want to stay here.	Hic manere nolo.
What is?.	Quid est?.
Yes it was.	Etiam erat.
Which was enough.	Quod satis erat.
Don't play with us.	Noli nobiscum ludere.
Or as he pleases.	Vel ut velit.
You can't do that.	Quod facere non potes.
I can't think of it like that.	Non possum cogitare de illo sicut illud.
Don't talk to me like you used to.	Non mecum loqui ut solebat.
To never or never.	Ut non numquam vel.
Only.	Solus.
if possible.	si potest.
It is true, it is true.	Verum est, verum est.
He was here.	Hic fuit.
I don't mean it.	Non vult eam.
I don't really say much else.	Non multum aliud vere dicam.
Please help.	Placet auxilium.
It was too late.	Sero erat.
He always says what he wants.	Semper dicit quid velit.
Stay with me.	Mane mecum.
I don't do that much.	Non id tantum facio.
i can see for myself.	videre possum pro me.
This one was difficult.	Hoc unum erat difficile.
If you can, you can.	Si potes, potes.
I don't know what to say.	Nescio quid dicam.
I never did.	Numquam feci.
It should be very late.	Sero admodum debet esse.
Has a job.	Habet officium.
What he understood.	Quod intellexit.
You have so much to say.	Habes tantum dicere.
And this was as much as I did before.	Et hoc fuit quantum ego ante.
I don't know what's the problem.	Nescio quid sit quaestio.
I wanted to be certain.	Certum esse volui.
Thus he did it.	Sic eum fecit.
the matter however.	rem tamen.
I'm really, really sorry.	Sum vere, vere paenitet.
No that's none of us.	Nulla id nulla nobis.
I need to get a job.	Mihi opus est ut officium.
He does not come.	Non venit.
Well, it was not said.	Bene, non est dictum.
Maybe you can even stop doing it.	Fortasse facere potes etiam prohibere.
He knows everything too well.	Omnia nimium bene novit.
Perhaps he	Forsitan ille .
But it is not.	Sed non enim est.
I don't like now.	Non ut nunc.
I wanted something better.	Volui aliquid melius.
There's always.	Nulla semper.
But that's how it is.	Sed id ipsum quam.
He could not do this.	Hoc facere non potuit.
Always ready.	Semper paratus.
never met him.	numquam ei occurrit.
You cannot be	Non potes esse .
And started to talk to me.	Mihi quoque incepit loqui.
he wished to remain.	manere voluit.
Yes, so it is true.	Sic, ita verum est.
But something, something.	Sed aliquid, aliquid.
who could not come.	qui venire non potuit.
Stop! 	Prohibere!
Just a man saying nothing.	Homo iustus nihil dicere.
None and none but none.	Nulla et nisi nulla.
.	.
I didn't do anything.	Audivi non facere quicquam.
He wasn't sure he would do it.	Certum non erat facturum.
Name whatever you want.	Nomen quod vis.
Thus he does.	Sic facit.
That's great for you.	Ut in magna enim.
He was willing to do so.	Velit id erat.
But here there is need.	Sed hic opus est.
I thought about it again.	Cogitavi de illo iterum.
It's not just the type of money.	Non solum pecuniae genus est.
First, there is no need for it.	Modo, opus non est in eo.
This seems unlikely.	Hoc videtur probabile.
But you know it was.	Sed scis erat.
You'll never do that.	Numquam id facere.
I love that guy.	Qui guy amo.
I can see again.	Iterum videre possum.
Don't see or hear from anyone anymore.	Noli amplius videre vel audire ab aliquo.
There was probably something in between.	Probabiliter erat aliquid inter.
If you call me	Si me.
He doesn't seem to have a name.	Nomen habere non videtur.
No one you know.	Nemo scis.
It has not been said before.	Etiam nec dictum ante.
I feel this way.	sic sentio.
And this was done.	Quod et factum est.
You have to live.	Vivere habes.
Yes you know that.	Etiam id scis.
You don't need me.	Non opus est mihi.
Maybe there was none at all.	Aliquam non erat nulla.
The boy and the man.	Puer et vir.
We are not yet there.	Nondum ibi sumus.
I've seen.	Ego vidi.
he knew what was going to happen.	quid futurum esset sciebat.
Maybe who it was now.	Aliquam quis nunc erat.
This is my room, he thought.	Cubiculum meum hic est, putabat.
He does it all at once.	Facit ut omnes simul.
But here it is much to see.	Sed hic multum est videre.
Yes, at least he didn't.	Etiam certe iam noluit.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
You really need it.	Vere opus est.
He knew what he was doing.	Sciebat quid faceret.
yes they are here for you.	Etiam hic sunt tibi.
Trying to be as good as possible.	Conatur, ut nunc potest.
For such a long time.	Tam diu.
Just see if he's there.	Vide modo si ibi est.
It certainly does better.	Melius certe facit.
It is probable.	Probabile est.
Or it has.	Vel habet.
Don't ask me.	Non a me.
It was this morning.	Mane hoc fuit.
I do not think.	Non puto.
There is still need for a father to be well.	Pater adhuc opus est ut bene sit.
It is now.	Nunc est.
i was with someone.	essem apud aliquem.
He does not want us to be alone.	Solus nos esse non vult.
There was something wrong here.	Aliquid hic mali fuit.
Now perhaps again.	Iam fortasse iterum.
He or she wants to be.	Ut vel velit est.
I saw him yesterday morning.	Heri mane eum vidi.
It is certainly possible.	Fieri certe potest.
I'm not quite ready.	Non satis paratus sum.
It is a good name.	Bonum nomen est.
It's time to get it done.	Aliquam ut dictum est.
he asked of me.	quaesivit a me.
He saw her again last night.	Vidit eam iterum nocte.
That means he is ready.	Id modo paratus sit.
And this much has been said.	Et hoc multum dictum est.
That's a lot.	Quod sit amet est.
i never feel it.	numquam id sentio.
I was there this morning.	Ibi hoc mane eram.
He did not do well for himself.	Non sibi bene fecit.
He likes to play.	Ludere vult.
You can travel now if you want.	Nunc iter si vis potes.
Certainly, this is enough.	Certe, hoc satis est.
However, he already understood.	Tamen iam intellexit.
It's not going to be so bad.	Non tam malum futurum est.
He refused to believe.	Noluit credere.
He would not hear her say.	Noluit audire eam dicere.
he knows better.	melius scit.
It is better now.	Melius est modo.
I'm kind of a.	Im genus a.
Do not do this.	Noli hoc facere.
Too bad it's not a thing.	Nimis malum non est res.
He is gone.	Abiit.
She just did it.	Illa modo fecit.
It would not be.	Non esset.
Do you want to live like this?	Visne sic vivere?
Nothing surprises me anymore.	Nihil miror amplius.
I do not know.	Nescio.
Maybe too much.	Nimium si quid forte.
From which I have not heard.	Ex quo non audivi.
This is a good question.	Haec bona quaestio est.
He was there and did it.	Ibi erat ille fecit.
You only do.	Tu tantum fac.
He also saw nothing else.	Is quoque nihil aliud vidit.
Nothing more.	Nihil amplius.
He thought his guy could go, and he didn't want to.	Putabat suum guy ire posse, et nolebat.
And this is only the first time.	Et hoc est solum primum.
So they started.	Ita ut incepit.
I don't know how to help her.	Nescio quomodo eam adiuvet.
In some alone time.	In aliquam solum est.
Better to do the job.	Melius facere officium.
I can't stay.	manere non possum.
That	Quod.
Not a lot of things.	Non multum omnia.
Nothing about him.	Nihil de eo.
Wherefore shall I say.	Quare dicam.
And it was good.	Erat autem bona.
Well done to all.	Bene omnibus.
He does not know.	Nescit.
This might not be good.	Hoc ne sit bonum.
The same thing happened.	Simile factum est.
Something for everyone.	Aliquid pro omnibus.
Definitely want to play again.	Certo volo ludere iterum.
Can't know for sure anything.	Non potest pro certo aliquid scire.
Now that's none.	Nunc id nulla est.
Or how to do so.	Vel quam id.
It is very important.	Aliquam sit amet ipsum.
He did a lot of traveling and often got home late.	Multum iter fecit et saepe sero domum obtinuit.
But somehow he didn't think so.	Sed nescio quo modo non putabat.
Unless you like yourself.	Nisi ut ipsum.
Get more money this time.	Plus pecuniae hoc tempore.
Maybe it was.	Aliquam erat.
But he gave the whole thing.	Sed totum dedit.
We're not getting anything right now.	Nos nihil iam non questus.
And if you do.	Et si feceris.
He also said out loud.	Etiam dictum magna.
But certainly it is not so.	Sed certe non ita est.
That which is not, is not related to anything, but.	Quod non est, non est ad aliquid, sed.
It is not.	Non est.
I don't know what that is.	Nescio quid id est.
I myself have done it.	Ego ipse feci.
It was too much for us.	Nimium nobis fuit.
I was in school.	Fui in schola.
Which way it was done.	Quod ita factum est.
Can still do it for sure.	Certo potest adhuc facere.
You told me you didn't.	Dixisti mihi te non fecisse.
Well, maybe lucky.	Bene, fortasse felix.
But this was not.	Sed hoc non fuit.
That is true.	Id verum est.
And yet he is here.	Et tamen est hic.
I love everything.	Omnia amo.
I just thought you know.	Modo te scire putabam.
Have something to talk about.	Habere aliquid loqui.
This never occurred to me.	Hoc nunquam mihi occurrit.
Not so much today.	Tantum non hodie.
He was at home.	Erat domi.
Say it again.	Dic iterum.
There is still more to do.	Plus tamen est facere.
Nothing was done except to speak.	Nihil factum est, nisi loqui.
I just couldn't do the work.	Ego iustus opus facere non potuit.
he is with me.	mecum est.
It was from some story.	Aliquam a aliquam erat.
I wanted to know everything.	omnia scire volui.
Not much more than that.	Non multo quam.
That was my job.	Meum id erat officium.
Everyone knows you.	Novit vos omnes.
It was not like this.	Hoc non erat simile.
it was never enough.	satis numquam fuit.
I'm so good at you.	Im tam bonum quam tu.
I like it too much.	Mihi nimium placet.
With him, ab, ad.	Cum illo, ab, ad.
I will not speak.	non dicam.
He looks like where he is now.	Spectat ut ille ubi nunc est.
He's not talking much, but he's coming.	Non multum loquitur sed venit.
I know you don't believe this.	Scio te hoc non credere.
That's what it will be in the morning.	Id quod mane erit.
This also seemed true.	hoc quoque verum videbatur.
And you can't.	Et non potes.
When he is gone, he is gone!	Cum abiit, abiit!
That's right, when.	SIC, cum.
Now I have one.	Nunc quis me habere.
And not.	Et non.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
Now he knows better.	Nunc melius novit.
I don't need to do anything.	Non opus est facere aliquid.
It is often difficult to hear.	Saepe difficile est audire.
He still does not think.	Ille tamen non putat.
From when.	Ex cum.
They know nothing.	Nihil se scire.
I never try my best.	Numquam meum ad.
It's late, it's too late.	Sero, sero.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
You said something this morning.	Hoc mane aliquid dixisti.
She asked me. 	Rogavit me. 
No one should know.	Nemo scire debet.
I know it's good.	Scio bonum esse.
There will be no need.	Non opus erit.
And now it's too late.	Et nunc sero factum est.
You've done this so far.	Fecisti hoc usque.
all this time.	totum hoc tempus.
Even if you think it probably isn't.	Etiam si putas, verisimile non est.
never met him.	numquam ei occurrit.
We're all here now.	Omnes hic nunc sumus.
I am sure you.	Certus sum tibi.
I wonder if this is good.	Miror si hoc bonum est.
but not by men.	homines autem non.
They don't meet often.	Et non saepe occurrit.
To ask him before.	Ut a ipsum ante.
That's enough.	Quod satis est.
I have my problem.	Meus sum quaestio.
I don't know enough.	Non satis scio.
There is a lot to be done.	Multum est faciendum.
But no one wants it.	Sed id nulla velit.
He was the only one to do so.	Erat solum id.
i think i love you very much.	Puto te valde amo.
Maybe that's kind of it.	Forsitan id genus est.
But see.	Sed vide.
He does not speak.	Non loquitur.
The thing was with me.	Res mecum fuit.
This he did not wish.	Hoc non voluit.
You can, you can do it all.	Potes, potes totum facere.
The time was like nothing.	Tempus erat ut nihil.
And how much is it.	Et quantum est.
Nothing to it.	Nihil ad eam.
Maybe that's just what you need to know.	Fortasse illud solum est quod debes scire.
That is not the case now.	Quod iam non est.
You don't want me to think about me.	Non vis me cogitare pro me.
If he is here, well.	Si hic est, bene.
We're here to do the job.	Facere officium hic sumus.
I will too.	Volo etiam.
You are my father.	Pater meus es tu.
Both are correct.	Utrumque recte.
This is going to be easy.	Hoc futurum facile est.
It was some or something.	Aliquam vel aliquam erat.
He loves	Is amat.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
and not now.	nec iam.
And this is easy to understand.	Et hoc facile est intelligere.
Yes, it is, it must be.	Ita est, necesse est esse.
That's hard to accept.	Quod difficile est accipere.
It is not enough.	Non satis.
Can't wait.	Manere non potest.
We like something a lot.	Multum nobis placet aliquid.
That is why.	Ille est cur.
He wanted to do everything, but with her.	Omnia facere voluit, sed cum illa.
I hope you win.	Spero te vincere.
He was a dog.	canis erat.
All of this.	Omnes id.
We can do everything.	Omnia possumus facere.
I wonder what is behind this thing.	Miror quid sit post hanc rem.
Let's say something.	Sit aliquid.
He would not find her here.	Noluit hic invenire eam.
You should probably just go now.	Nunc probabiliter tantum ire debes.
He has.	Habet.
To me it is much better.	Mihi quidem multo melius est.
Me, me, me.	Me, me, me.
What a teacher.	Quid magister.
And another.	Et aliud.
We cannot do this.	Id fieri non possumus.
I wish I could not.	Utinam non.
I really like to see him.	Ego vere amo illum videre.
He ate quickly and went away.	Cito comedit et abiit.
I've done things.	Feci res.
I will tell you.	Dicam tibi.
Which indeed is the case.	Quod quidem ita se habet.
Yes, we can.	Ita, possumus.
But he does not wish.	Sed non velit.
But we are men.	Sed homines sumus.
Well, that's good.	Bene, quod bonum est.
But I doubt that I can do this.	Sed dubito me hoc facere posse.
The same again.	Ipse iterum.
he said a little.	parum dixit.
It was a good job.	Officium erat bonum.
who can believe you?	quis te credere potest.
It seems to have been a little longer lately.	Nuper videtur paulo amplius fuisse.
what is yours?	quid tibi est?.
It is good for him.	Bonum est ei.
I am certain.	Certum habeo.
Yes that's how great.	Etiam id quam magna.
I'll do a lot today.	Faciam hodie multum facere.
We're gonna get that.	Amet nobis ut.
He did it, so he did it.	Ipse fecit, sic fecit.
It is probable and does not do good.	Probabile est et bonum non facit.
I know you want something.	Scio te aliquid velle.
But he did not give time.	Sed tempus non dedit.
You know he was going to do it on his own.	Scis se facturum esse de suo.
This was certainly true.	Hoc certe verum fuit.
I don't talk much anymore.	Non multum amplius loqui.
I think he wants something to do.	Puto se velle aliquid facere.
He didn't understand why.	Cur non intellexit.
I don't want to have this.	Nolo hoc habere.
This will take some time.	Id aliquam tempus.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
No, not much.	Non, non multum.
so I'll tell you well.	ut bene tibi dicam.
Not very good.	Non ipsum bonum esse.
There was no such thing.	Nulla res erat.
SO.	SIC.
You don't have to deal with someone else.	Non multum tibi est cum aliquo.
I need to do better.	Melius opus est facere.
I really don't have time this year.	Ego vere hoc anno tempus non habet.
Nothing else could be done.	Nihil aliud potuit.
I don't need to see it again.	Non opus est videre illud.
What a great post.	Quae magna post.
It's not so bad.	Non ita malum est.
He said not much.	Non multa dixit.
I could not do it.	Non potui facere.
Okay, but we don't have enough time.	Bene, sed tempus satis non habemus.
I am not surprised after you.	Miror non post te.
That seemed likely.	Quod verisimile videbatur.
However, it is so.	Tamen sic est.
He was alone in school.	Solus in schola erat.
He will see you early next week.	Dixit te videre mane septimana proxima.
We're gonna be great.	Nunc ad amet magna.
In what has been said.	In quod dictum est.
He knew, however, that he could do nothing more.	Sciebat tamen nihil amplius facere posse.
He knows us.	Scit nos.
Well it is how you are doing.	Bene est quomodo tu facis.
he thought.	putavit.
She told me not.	Mihi non indicavit.
That's how well.	Id quam bene.
I'm as happy as you are.	Me quam sit amet quam.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum enim.
If he was unwilling to do anything, he did not.	Si aliquid facere noluit, non fecit.
I think they can do something pretty good.	Puto posse aliquid satis bona facere.
I can't stay.	Non possum manere.
But perhaps it was not.	Sed fortasse non erat.
This is true again this year.	Hoc iterum hoc anno verum est.
I said no more.	non dixi amplius.
Perhaps both are true.	Fortasse utrumque verum est.
but they are men.	sed homines sunt.
It is good for him.	Bonum est ei.
No one is talking to me.	Nemo mihi loqui.
I didn't want to be true to the truth.	Nolui vere verum.
But not often.	Sed non saepe.
Who is that man?	Quis est ille homo?
It was time for some fun.	Aliquam sit amet tempus erat.
I just can't find it.	Ego iustus invenire non possum.
But not only.	Sed non nisi.
Things are not good for us.	Res non sunt nobis bona.
She treats me so badly.	Ita me male habet.
There is a lot of work to be done.	Multum opus futurum est.
.	.
It was true.	Verum erat.
But it is not yours.	Sed non est tua.
That has nothing to do with me.	Id nihil ad me.
I have not met this.	Non id occurrit.
Today nothing can be found here.	Hodie nihil hic eum invenire potest.
it is necessary to speak.	loqui necesse est.
Find out for yourself.	Id pro te invenire.
I can't get enough of it.	Non possum satis ex eo.
This was too much for you.	Nimium tibi hoc fuit.
It also doesn't look good.	Etiam non bene videri.
He too.	Ipse quoque.
which I wanted.	quam hoc volui.
It seemed.	Videbatur.
But we do not have it.	Sed id non habemus.
I don't know.	Non me novi.
But that's before now.	Sed id ante nunc.
what can i do.	Quid facere possum.
Never be friends with me.	Numquam amicos mecum.
He thinks for sure something else.	Putat certe aliquid aliud.
No one really knows for sure.	Nemo vere scit pro certo.
But it is difficult to think of it.	Sed id difficile est cogitare.
But you can do this to me.	Sed hoc mihi potes.
And they are good.	Et bona sunt.
He said it was not going to happen.	Non futurum dixit.
He was ready.	Paratus esset.
We cannot do this.	Hoc fieri non possumus.
This has not occurred till now.	Hoc non huc usque occurrit.
He could not understand this.	Hoc intelligere non potuit.
Now I don't want him, not this.	Nunc non velit ipsum, non hac.
Yes, there was no one else.	Etiam nec aliquam erat.
Paul.	Paulo.
He was a stronger man.	Ipse homo plus erat.
But it was not either.	Sed vel non erat.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
No, but there was none.	Nulla sed erat nulla.
That's the best we can do.	Id optime facere possumus.
I'm sorry for him.	Paenitet eum.
He's not used to it.	Non ille esse solebat.
Actually I did, she thought.	Vere feci, putavit.
It is not fun.	Non amet.
I am him.	ego eum.
Maybe he says so.	Forsitan ita dicit.
You can do the same.	Idem facere potes.
It was my decision.	Meum erat consilium.
We can't come there.	Nos illuc venire possum.
i made one	unum feci.
It's time to a.	Aliquam a.
so great.	magna sic.
so I tried.	ita conatus sum.
I can't believe I do this.	Hoc facere non possum credere.
Nothing to do with this.	Nihil ad hoc.
i think i could.	posse puto.
But it is so.	Sed ita est.
Good morning to you.	Bonum mane ad te.
If anyone could, he would be.	Si quis posset, eum fore.
I see him.	Ego illum vide.
I don't like it here.	Non placet hic.
What would she do really like to go home.	Quid se facere vere placet ire domum.
To always be yourself, not yourself.	Ut semper ipsum non ipsum.
There was certainly a wish.	Non erat certe velle.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
This will only be true.	Hoc solum erit.
He said rightly, always.	Recte dixit, semper.
But nothing to him.	Sed nihil ad ipsum.
There's a lot of work.	Non multum opus est.
That's what he does.	Id quod facit.
Only you know both.	Utrumque solum scis.
This time he has not.	Hoc tempus non habet.
No one asked.	Nemo quaesivit.
Everyone ate.	Omnes comedit.
It's my job to see this.	Meum est officium haec videre.
I really mean.	Ego vere vult.
He did not say why.	Non dixit quare.
but that time was not enough.	tamen id temporis satis erat.
It's getting to the point that I'm speaking right.	Is de die questus est quod me recte loqui.
That's what I really understood.	Id vere intellexit.
I'm going home today.	Nunc domum hodie.
I didn't forget.	Oblitus non sum.
please do it to me.	quaeso id mihi facias.
he was not very happy.	non nimis felix erat.
But the job has not been done.	Sed officium non est factum.
ya i like.	Puer mihi placet.
I'd never do that.	Id numquam facere.
He was truly here.	Vere hic erat.
we travel before we travel.	iter ante sumus iter.
Are you ready?	Paratus es?
It's time not out.	Aliquam non ex.
I just want to say this.	Hoc solum volo dicere.
he did it for sure.	pro certo fecit.
I don't know what he's talking about.	Nescio quid loquitur.
It will be the same one.	Idem erit unus.
Yes, they are fine.	Etiam, bene sunt.
Well the same again.	Bene idem iterum.
There is no need to say much about this.	Ne hoc quidem opus est multa dicere.
I want to be true.	verum esse volo.
I can't either.	Non possum vel.
This is different.	Hoc aliud est.
And after that.	Et post illud.
At length he said.	Tandem dixit.
All right with me.	Recte mecum.
it was his.	eius fuit.
She still doesn't understand.	Illa adhuc non intellexit.
I like this way.	Placet hoc modo.
I don't want to see you.	Nolo te videre.
What is it.	Quid est hoc.
Yes, you exist.	Ita, tu est.
I don't like it very much.	Id mihi non valde placet.
I can speak.	loqui possum.
if you will, you will.	si vis, vis.
If they are okay.	Si sunt, bene.
Nor do we.	Nec nos.
I don't know this.	Hoc nescio.
I don't look well.	Non vide bene.
I think it's true.	verum puto.
No one could do it better.	Nemo melius id facere potuit.
No one knew what happened.	Quod factum est nemo scivit.
There's nothing great.	In nulla magna.
Now I can speak.	Iam possum dicere.
There was not much time.	Non multum temporis fuit.
it is not good to speak.	loqui non est bonum.
Maybe he could too.	Fortasse potuit etiam.
But it seems.	Sed videtur.
I'm scared of being here.	Vix hic sum.
I thought for him.	Cogitavi pro eo.
I don't feel it often.	Non sentio saepe.
I could have everything.	omnia habere potui.
It was a bad night.	Sed male nocte illa.
You need to learn to help people raise money.	Scire debes homines adiuvare pecuniam.
Certainly to me.	Mihi certe.
They are okay too.	Bene quoque sunt.
It should be great.	Sit magna.
You can't and won't win.	Non potes nec vincere.
It was great.	Erat magna.
i can never stay.	numquam manere possum.
It could still be great.	Posset magna adhuc.
But however.	Sed tamen.
But there was some wish.	Aliquam sed erat velit.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
It was too late for work.	Sero opus erat.
What do you think of him?	Quid de illo cogitas?
Someone knows all about us.	Novit aliquis de nobis omnibus.
That's where he was.	Id quo eum.
.	.
But see what you want to hear.	Sed vide quid vis audire.
he would not do it.	id non facturum.
The same here is the same.	Idem hic idem.
And how late?	Quomodo autem sero?
you want to know me.	apud me scire vis.
Don't ever say.	Noli umquam dicere.
yes you're on video.	Etiam te in video.
This is the text.	Hoc est illud.
This does not mean that.	Hoc non vult esse.
We have a pharmacy.	Habemus a velit.
It was done in this way.	Factum est hoc modo.
I want your trip to be with me first.	Primum iter tuum volo mecum esse.
It's not that.	Non quod.
But this was true.	Sed hoc erat verum.
I tried really hard to find.	Conatus sum vere invenire difficile.
Yes it is.	Ita sit.
It could be a bad thing.	Malum esse posse.
But it is well, he himself said.	Sed bene est, ipse dixit.
They are not good.	Non sunt bona.
It's not my problem.	Quaestio est, non mea.
He had not.	Non habuit.
Well there you have it.	Bene ibi habes.
You are not one.	Non unum.
Well done by me.	Bene est a me.
It seems pretty easy.	Satis facile videtur.
But it was only said.	Sed non dictum nisi.
It was a name, but hardly a man.	Nomen erat, sed vix homo.
You did the thing	Fecisti rem
We can't do everything.	Omnia nos facere non possumus.
I guess somehow they make their own money.	Suspicor aliquo modo pecuniam suam facere.
Now he knows.	Nunc scit.
Today's event is totally non-existent.	Res hodie prorsus nulla est.
It would be great.	Magna esset.
That is not true here.	Quod hic verum non est.
If this is the case, you do it.	Si hoc est, facis.
It will probably be.	Probabile erit.
A a.	A a.
There was none in the game.	Nulla in velit erat.
To Ex.	Ad Ex.
He's ready to do it.	Ille paratus facere.
But that is not true.	Sed id non est verum.
just as it was done.	sicut et factum est.
He comes to us.	Venit ad nos.
I could not hear.	audire non potui.
Or a little longer.	Vel paulo diutius.
Or tomorrow night.	Vel cras nocte.
There is neither good nor evil, there is no good.	Non est bonum nec malum, non est bonum.
He likes and wants.	Velit et velit.
Both are very good.	Utrumque valde bonum est.
I don't think it would be.	Non puto fore.
You make one.	Tu fac unum.
I know what you mean.	Scio quid velis.
You have nothing.	Nihil habes.
But that's never enough.	Sed id numquam satis.
I can't speak.	Dicere non possum.
but I've never got it.	Ego tamen nunquam obtinuit.
Now that's not good.	Nunc non est quam.
What time do you plan to leave?	Quod tempus relinquere cogitas?
Always be sick.	Semper sit male.
And there was another.	Et aliud fuit.
But he can't do it enough.	Sed id satis facere non potest.
i still want it.	adhuc volo.
That's what happened.	Id factum est.
I do both.	Utrumque facio.
I had my whole room.	Cubiculum mihi totum habui.
It is necessary to go with us.	Nobiscum ire necesse est.
But this is only true to some extent.	Sed hoc solum verum est usque ad aliquid.
and this evil.	et hoc malum.
I thought you were the only one.	Putabam te unum solum esse.
If you can't, it's fine.	Si non potes, bene est.
You know what you have.	Tu quid habes.
The boy saw nothing.	Puer nihil vidit.
And rightly so.	Et recte.
I know you're able to do this.	Scio te hoc facere posse.
I don't even know how to do it.	Nescio etiam quomodo id facias.
Now	Nunc.
It's not easy to talk to me.	Loqui non facile ad me venit.
But that's not the case right now.	Sed id ipsum nulla nunc.
I thought the same thing.	Idem cogitavi.
Nothing tonight.	Nihil hac nocte.
I didn't even want to come here.	Ne hic quidem volui venire.
I don't quite know why.	Non satis scio cur.
I never wanted anything else.	Numquam aliud voluit.
You don't want to talk.	Loqui non vis.
He loves to play.	Ludere amat.
At least she could do that.	Quod certe facere posset.
I am the last thing.	Ego tandem rem.
i know so much about you.	tantum de te scio.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I just don't believe.	Non solum non credere.
I had a dog.	Canem me habui.
You have some, some.	Aliquam habes, aliquam.
I know you're not.	Non novi te esse.
No one says.	Dicit nemo.
Maybe that's the game.	Aliquam id velit.
And it's a little better there.	Et illud paulo melius ibi est.
Nothing has been done yet.	Nihil tamen factum est.
But that's how.	Quam id, sed.
To believe in yourself.	Ut in ipsum.
This was not enough for you already.	Hoc tibi iam satis non erat.
You can't, you don't want to.	Non potes, non vis.
I know looks like.	Novi vultus amo.
I haven't heard yet.	Non audivi adhuc.
Do you know whether?	Scis an.
There was none.	Non fuit.
We don't have anyone here.	Quis hic non habemus.
But that's not often.	Sed id non saepe.
i want to win.	vincere volo.
Yes that is good.	Ita quod est bonum.
There is only something in it.	Non nisi aliquid in ipsum.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
He was ready indeed.	Erat paratus quidem.
I don't know how he did it.	Nescio quomodo id fecerit.
By itself.	Per ipsum.
He soon got along with him.	Qui mox cum eo obtinuit.
I don't like it.	Id mihi non placet.
and lately too.	et nuper etiam.
It is good.	Bonum est.
You don't need to have.	Non opus est tibi habere.
we cannot know.	scire non possumus.
But one thing .	Sed unum .
Nothing is that hard.	Nihil est quod difficile.
She was still very busy.	Fuit tamen valde occupatus.
You're here a lot.	Tu hic multum.
Enough yet.	Satis adhuc.
And the story is said to be great.	Aliquam et dictum magna.
There is almost nothing like that.	Nihil fere ut est.
When we are at home, we are not.	Cum domi sumus, non sumus.
It was not said.	Dictum non est.
You yourself are right.	Recte tu ipse.
How can you even know this?	Quomodo etiam hoc scire potes?
Is good.	Bonus est.
None in this article.	Nulla in dictum ipsum.
It's hard to say anything.	Suus 'difficile est ei aliquid dicere.
It's not done.	Non est factum.
I don't believe that much any.	Non credo quod quis multa.
ily something.	Occurrit ei aliquid.
I just want you to understand.	Te solum intelligere volo.
You need to do this.	Hoc debes facere.
I don't know what, but it's bad.	Nescio quid, sed malum est.
That's how you look.	Id quomodo vide.
Yes it is.	Ita est illud.
One cannot act.	Unum agere non potest.
No one can do this to you.	Hoc tibi nemo facere potest.
That it was.	Quod esset.
I don't want to talk to you.	tecum loqui nolo.
I just couldn't.	Modo non potui.
Not well.	Non bene.
.	' '.
The morning has not yet come to her.	Mane nondum venit ad eam.
i'm not so much there.	Im non tam enim.
I can't say for sure.	Pro certo dicere non possum.
Or so it was said to us.	Vel ita nobis dictum est.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
We don't need anymore.	Non opus est nobis amplius.
Don't do anything else.	Ne quid aliud.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
If anything happens.	Si quid acciderit.
That was	Quod erat.
No more.	Non amplius.
It could be us.	Posset esse nobis.
Tell me.	Dic mihi.
You don't want to be there.	Ibi non vis esse.
He doesn't make friends.	Non facit amicos.
This is difficult.	Hoc difficile est.
No, i don't like home.	Non, id non placet domi.
It was still good.	Adhuc bona erat.
perhaps he is.	forsitan ipse est.
It's not the game.	Non est velit.
I do not love you.	Non amo te.
Certainly to me indeed.	Mihi quidem certe.
This was the way to go.	Hoc erat iter faciendum.
But somehow he could not speak.	Sed nescio quo modo loqui non potuit.
I'm not really so.	Non sum vere ita .
This is how you do it.	Hoc quomodo facias.
He is getting on.	Ipse questus est.
He left after lunch.	Post prandium reliquit.
That is all for him.	Quod sit omnibus ad ipsum.
Maybe that was great.	Aliquam id magna erat.
I can't believe it but it does.	Non possum credere bene, sed facit.
It is true.	Verum est.
This was not exactly the plan.	Hoc prorsus consilium non erat.
It could be anything.	Posset esse aliquid.
She could be happy at home.	Posset esse domi felix.
I have to do it.	Habeo facere id.
Mine is coming to me that way.	Meus mihi venit illuc.
I was not good enough.	Non satis fui.
You can't live alone without him.	Non solum non sine se vivere.
All right, probably.	Recte, probabiliter.
You can hear it there.	Est ibi audire potes.
I don't think it would be.	Non puto fore.
Tell me what you know.	Dic quid scis.
Unable to stop.	Posset prohibere.
Which he does pretty well too.	Quod fere bene etiam facit.
what better?	quid melius?.
It's going to be from you.	Futurum est a te.
Too early to say.	Nimis mane est dicere.
That's your plan.	Quod tuum est consilium.
I don't know why this is so.	Nescio an id cur ita sit.
He has not yet realized that there is a need.	Nondum opus esse intellexit.
He came to stay with us.	Venit nobiscum manere.
There seemed to be nothing.	Videbatur nihil esse.
But tell me.	Sed dic mihi.
This seems really good to you.	Hoc vere bonum tibi videtur.
Tell her the truth.	Dic ei verum.
He likes to know that he loves him.	Scire vult se amat.
We can do this.	Hoc facere possumus.
He told us.	Ille nobis dixit.
He could not speak to himself.	Se loqui non potuit.
But still.	Sed adhuc.
I can better see what needs to be done.	Melius videre possum quid opus sit faciendum.
i'm ready to go.	paratus sum ire.
It will never be better.	Numquam hoc melius erit.
Yes that's for now.	Etiam id nunc enim.
But that's none of it.	Sed id nulla ex.
never for it.	Numquam enim eam.
I'm doing pretty good.	Ego satis bonum facio.
I like what you have to say.	Placet id quod habes dicere.
He did not see me.	Me non vidit.
That's no big thing.	Ut id nulla magna.
Totally happy.	Prorsus suum.
I haven't seen one.	Non vidi unum.
You are doing well.	Bene facis.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
Be sure to take advice.	Vide ut consilium.
Stop me now.	Nunc me prohibere.
This plan is for you.	Hoc consilium est tibi.
It was done so.	Factum est ita.
What was true? 	Quid verum erat?
You can't do everything by yourself.	Non potes omnia per te ipsum facere.
From him who has not.	Ab eo qui non habet.
I just don't want to.	Ut non velit.
It was very good.	Erat valde bona.
Better than nothing.	Melius quam nihil est.
But also from.	Sed et ex.
But not as much.	Sed ne quam.
This is what he wanted.	Hoc est quod voluit.
It is a great thing.	Magna res est.
I've seen it done before.	Factum ante te vidi.
And it is not good.	Et non est bonum.
There is no way to do it yourself.	Nulla id ipsum ut enim.
He did not do this.	Hoc non fecit.
Well, that's not true.	Bene, quod verum non est.
It was fun to do that.	Facere amet erat ut quam.
But not as much as he wants.	Sed non quam velit.
But the work is not yet done.	Sed opus nondum est.
He loves him.	Amat eum.
Well got it.	Bene obtinuit.
Certainly to me.	Mihi certe.
Look at the matter pretty much.	Vide rem satis.
How can you say it?	Quomodo potes dicere?
It is necessary to speak.	Loqui necesse est.
He has not done very well.	Non valde bene fecit.
Now for the purpose.	Modo ad rem.
It seemed true.	Vere videbatur.
At least he knew better.	Melius certe sciebat.
He always does too.	Semper nimium facit.
That's not very important.	Ut non magna ipsum.
But certainly.	Sed certe.
It's still okay.	Bene tamen est.
We can never know.	Numquam scire possumus.
No that's none.	Nulla id nulla.
There can be only one.	Non potest esse nisi unus.
You are not right.	Non recte.
If so it is.	Si ita est.
This really is.	Hoc vere est.
Only one here.	Hic, unus tantum.
This would be easy.	Hoc facile esset.
It is not true.	Non est verum.
He had an apple	Malum habuit .
Good to know to be with him now.	Bonum scire, esse cum illo modo.
And well indeed.	Et bene quidem.
This is where it has been for a while.	Hic ubi ad tempus fuit.
And now it is done.	Et nunc factum est.
I haven't been happy for a long time.	Non diu felix fuit.
It's not just about us.	Hoc non est solum de nobis.
often him.	Saepe eum.
I never heard of him.	Numquam de eo audivi.
He ate breakfast in the morning.	Mane prandium comedit.
I have never been.	numquam fui.
I hope it will be so.	Spero fore ut.
You can do this.	Hoc facere potes.
We need it now.	Nunc opus est nobis.
Perhaps this is true.	Fortasse hoc verum est.
I don't know anything about that.	Nescio quid de illa.
I will say something to him.	Dicam aliquid ei.
Good what he does.	Bonum quid facit.
This was something new.	Hoc erat aliquid novi.
He ought not to give it.	Non debet eam dare.
It's time to get some out of it.	Aliquam non aliquam ex.
It's good for you.	Bonum est tibi.
in someone.	In aliquem.
I had dinner late.	Ego nuper cenam habui.
But there is none at all.	Sed non est nulla.
We can't know anything about it.	Non possumus scire quid de eo.
I feel that you can do it well enough.	Quod quidem satis facere te posse sentio.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
This also seems to me.	Etiam hoc mihi videtur.
Not in this way.	Non hoc modo.
But from now	Sed a nunc.
He didn't like it at all.	Nolebat omnino.
It's too late, however.	Sero tamen.
you must go thither.	illuc ire debes.
What he said, he thought it was not a good work.	Quod dixit, bonum opus non putabat.
He has everything there.	Omnia ibi habet.
But he was here.	Sed erat hic.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
There is not enough time.	Non est satis temporis.
I just want to be home.	Ego iustus volo esse domi.
This is totally mine.	Prorsus hoc meum est.
There is no need to stop this.	Non opus est hoc prohibere.
From that time there is no problem.	Ex eo tempore nulla quaestio est.
You said the truth to him.	Tu verum ei dixisti.
only by name.	solum nomen.
I got lucky today.	Hodie felix obtinuit me.
No .	Non .
It is not.	Non est.
Don't swim here.	Hic natare noli.
I don't like this.	Hoc tibi non placet.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
I would not hear this.	hoc audire nolui.
It is important that you are always there.	Aliquam sit amet semper quam.
Nothing is enough.	Nihil satis est.
Do not accept this.	Noli hoc accipere.
I don't think you do.	Non puto te facere.
To be honest no.	Ut sit amet nulla.
He came here in the afternoon.	Hic post meridiem venit.
this I have to say.	hoc habeo dicere.
That is not true.	Id non est verum.
I know you're not here.	Non novi te hic esse.
We can't do that.	Quod facere non possumus.
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla nisi.
There is someone who needs something to be seen.	Est aliquis, qui debet aliquid videri.
I was there before.	Ibi ante eram.
No one ever says this.	Nemo umquam hoc dicit.
Do it yourself.	Facere se ipsum.
i believe in.	ego in.
He did not understand.	Non intellexit.
Please talk more.	Placet amplius loqui.
He truly is the one who thinks that she is.	Vere est qui putat eam esse.
He didn't think so.	Non putabat.
what does this mean?	Quid hoc sibi vult?
You will need it.	Ita opus erit.
I never wanted to leave home.	numquam domum relinquere volui.
He didn't want to think about it.	Noluit de illo cogitare.
and here I am now.	et hic nunc sum.
But now I have tried to see through this alone.	Nunc autem per hoc solum conatus est videre.
But see if they are not.	Sed vide si non sunt.
But he doesn't want to do it now.	Sed nec velit nunc, id nunc.
This has been done before.	Hoc ante factum est.
It's too hard.	Nimis suus difficile est.
He was thirty.	Triginta fuit.
He was himself.	Ipse erat.
You have done everything.	Omnia fecisti.
See what he is saying.	Vide quid loquitur.
Nor did he know what was to be done.	Nec sciebat quid faciendum esset.
I'm sorry for what I owe.	Paenitet me quod debeo.
What he can't do.	Quod facere non potest.
It is very good for us.	Valde nobis bene est.
I know what's happened.	Scio quid acciderit.
That there can be good and evil.	Quod bonum et malum esse potest.
To win is something.	Vincere est res.
I knew it wasn't so.	Sciebam non ita esse.
You go to her.	Tu ad eam.
It is certain that something must be done.	Certum est hoc aliquid quod faciendum est.
There was none in none.	Nulla in nulla erat.
I could not go.	Non potui ire.
I am ready.	Paratus sum.
I will tell you this.	Dicam tibi hoc.
It is not easy.	Non facile.
That doesn't surprise him.	Quod eum non miror.
If you don't have it, do it.	Si non habes, fac.
Not really.	Non vere.
But there was no need.	Sed opus non erat.
But not much longer.	Sed non multo diutius.
I think that is true for me.	Puto, quod verum est, ad me.
he said no more.	non dixit amplius.
Too bad he's hurting.	Nimis ille facere.
He was the only one that could be the only man.	Solus erat, ut solus homo esse potest.
But it was not enough.	Sed parum fuit.
The teacher is good.	Magister est bonus.
Something must be done about him.	De illo aliquid faciendum est.
I have seen the whole thing.	totum vidi.
What happened, I don't need to tell you.	Quod factum est, non opus est tibi dicere.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
That's how it's done.	Id quomodo factum est.
He knew how good he was, but never about him.	Sciebat quam bonus esset, sed nunquam de eo.
I really like it.	Ego vere amo eam.
I've never had anything like that.	Nunquam quicquam simile habuit.
But, you know, it's true.	Sed, scis, verum est.
That's easy indeed.	Facile id quidem.
No it is none.	Nulla id nulla est.
You can have whatever you want.	Habere potes quod vis.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
But it is not for me.	Sed non est mihi.
I truly hope this is true.	Vere spero hoc verum est.
Which can be seen thus.	Quod sic videri potest.
To do this.	Facere id.
But he was unwilling to hear this.	Sed hoc audire nolebat.
This also is nothing new.	Hoc quoque novi nihil est.
I feel it now.	eam nunc sentio.
Yes that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum.
Sure you're right.	Certus es recte.
The design seems pretty good.	Consilium satis bonum videtur.
He could not think.	Non potuit cogitare.
What do you want me to do?	Quid tibi vis facere?
Now I can see.	Nunc videre possum.
He could do nothing.	Nihil potuit.
You know correctly.	Tu recte scis.
I do it too.	Ego id quoque.
We can do this together.	Simul hoc facere possumus.
He told me not to say anything.	Ille mihi dixit ne quid dicam.
I will too.	Volo etiam.
Yes it was today.	Ita fuit hodie.
He wanted to say everything at the same time.	Omnia simul dicere voluit.
I know people are.	Scio homines esse.
There was no tomorrow.	Cras non erat.
He didn't want to know, though.	Noluit scire, sed.
You cannot live.	Vivere non potes.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
And getting better.	Et melius questus.
It is not.	Non est.
Yes that was.	Etiam id erat.
I did this almost too often.	Id fere saepe etiam feci.
Not at all.	Omnino non est.
And he could not believe it.	Et non potuit credere.
That's how very happy it is.	Ut sit amet ipsum quam.
No one knows where he is.	Nemo scit ubi sit.
I want him here now.	Eum hic nunc volo.
He is not here.	Non est hic.
He does nothing.	Nihil agit.
I also know who his father was.	Pater eius etiam scio qui fuit.
You exist, isn't it?	Tu est, annon?
I don't know what or how it happened.	Nescio quid vel quomodo id acciderit.
My name is.	Meum est nomen.
This is good and bad.	Hoc est bonum et malum.
But that's no time.	Sed id tempus nulla.
He does not say what it is.	Non dicit quid sit.
Well not so.	Bene non ita est.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
This morning in the spring.	Hoc mane vere.
What makes you so certain?	Quid te tam certum facit?
could not find.	Non potuit invenire.
He wanted, he thought.	Voluit, putabat.
We can accept this.	Hoc accipere possumus.
he seems to have forgotten.	oblitus videtur.
That's not the same thing.	Id ipsum non ipsum.
He comes to mind.	Ipse occurrit.
I need this one.	Hoc unum opus est.
But that was nothing.	Sed id erat nisi.
He could do it.	Posset id.
and so he will.	et sic vult.
And that it is.	Et ut sit.
But he didn't do anything.	Sed aliquid ei non facere.
But who rather than.	Sed quis quam.
It was a good afternoon.	Bonum erat post meridiem.
I'm sorry I can't say yes.	Paenitet etiam dicere possum.
It could be great.	Posset magna.
Thus man, yet not man.	Sic homo, nec tamen homo.
Probably too much.	Verisimiliter nimium.
I'm out of my car.	E meum currus sum.
But today was different for me.	Sed me hodie aliud fuit.
This is not the same.	Hoc non est idem.
To never.	Ut numquam.
He just gave himself up.	Modo se dedit.
Nothing but that thing.	Nihil nisi ut rem.
This was not true.	Hoc non erat verum.
He was alone when	Solus erat quando .
This is not for me.	Hoc non est mihi.
That he did not know.	Id nesciebat.
I'm here, man.	Sum hic, homo.
Now who is that.	Nunc quis quam est.
I could not live like this.	sic vivere non potui.
I had to do so.	Habui id.
What is this.	Quid hoc est.
Do you know what?	Scisne quid.
It is true in some way.	Verum est aliquo modo.
Why not all?	Cur non omnes?
She told him to do it.	Quae dixit ei ut faceret.
She told me.	Indicavit mihi.
Here it is, but it's too late.	Hic est, sed sero est.
There was none, nor was there any.	Nulla nec aliquam erat.
But it could be.	Posset autem.
And it is mine.	Et mea est.
It is a great thing.	Res magna est.
The only car.	Solus currus.
Yes it is not.	Ita non est.
I am for you.	Ego sum tibi.
He wants to help you.	Velit ut tibi auxilio esse.
Thus he said.	Ita dixit.
I just wanted to say this.	Hoc modo volui dicere.
That's what he did.	Id est quod fecit.
Or for some purpose.	Vel in aliquam rem.
But you never know what.	Sed numquam id quod.
But you did not do it, you know.	Sed non fecisti, scis.
This thing does not surprise him.	Quae res eum non miror.
Not good or good.	Non bene nec bonum.
He is gone.	Abiit.
But that is none.	Sed id nulla est.
That was from him.	Ut a ipsum erat.
Tomorrow I might be a little late.	Cras paulo sero essem.
I know more about you.	Scio plus tibi.
But that's how it is.	Sed id quam id.
You can stay there tonight.	Hac nocte ibi manere potes.
It is hard to believe that you are still alive.	Difficile est credere te adhuc vivere.
Yes there is nothing.	Etiam non est nisi.
But it wasn't really.	Sed non erat vere.
He said and did nothing.	Dixit, et nihil fecit.
I could not do more.	non potui amplius.
I only want one.	Unum tantum volo.
He was not.	Non erat.
Good good.	Bonum bonum.
It was time to do it again.	Tempus erat iterum facere.
That's what I'll do.	Id faciam.
It could be your happy day.	Posset esse tibi felix dies.
But you have something better than good.	Sed tu melius aliquid quam bonum habes.
I thought I could see him.	Putabam te videre eum posse.
I'm going to school.	Eo ad scholam.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
i think it was really good.	vere bonum esse puto.
No big time but some.	Nulla tempus magna sed aliquam.
What do you do there.	Quid ibi facias.
He could not do this.	Hoc facere non potuit.
Almost none of the options either.	Vel bene fere nulla.
I thought.	Cogitavi.
But he was still a boy.	Ille autem adhuc puer erat.
And my dog ​​wanted to like him.	Et canis meus vellet ei similis.
No one should do this.	Nemo hoc debet agere.
In the morning	Mane.
But not how to do so.	Sed non quam id.
He could do it very well.	Id optime agere posset.
I knew that it would happen.	sciebam fore.
That's what I'll do.	Id faciam.
Something is certain.	Certum aliquid est.
Say yes.	Ita dic.
Now I need any help.	Nunc quid opus est auxilio.
What will be after you.	Post te quid erit.
So it is.	Ita est.
That's what we're up to.	Id sumus ad.
Nor do we.	Nec nos.
You don't have this.	Non hoc habes.
I have no money for you.	Pecuniam tibi non habeo.
Here's who to get him.	Hic ipsum quis ut.
It is not for me.	Non est mihi.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I am doing my work through this.	Ego per hoc meum opus facio.
That is not true.	Quod non est.
But only this is correct.	Sed solum hoc recte.
It was definitely something else.	Certum erat aliquid aliud.
The room was, after all.	Cubiculum erat, post omnes.
He can't come home.	Domum venire non potest.
This is now about me.	Haec nunc de me.
He knew what he wanted to will that you can't have.	Sciebat quid vellet velle quod habere non potes.
This is true.	Hoc verum est.
So he did his job there.	Ita officium suum fecit ibi.
I just don't get enough of it.	Non solum non satis ab eo.
You can't see yourself alone.	Te solum videre non potes.
They are nothing but good to me.	Nihil nisi bona sunt mihi.
Something for you thinking.	Aliquid pro cogitas.
He did nothing now.	Nihil iam nunc fecit.
Maybe that's out.	Aliquam id est ex.
I knew you well.	Sciebam bene.
I believe not.	Non credo, ego.
I need to go well with this.	Ire debeo ad hoc bene.
I want everything for you.	Omnia volo tibi.
I guess my wife stays with me.	Suspicor uxorem me manere apud me.
Not much.	Non multum.
There was nothing else that could be done to him.	Nihil erat aliud quod ei fieri posset.
It made my day.	Is mihi fecit diem.
I don't know what it is.	quid sit nescio.
Something for you is nothing.	Aliquid pro te nihil.
It is not the same.	Ipsum non.
You can't think.	Non potes cogitare.
Now you know better than to do.	Nunc melius scis quam facere.
In a.	In a.
Or the car.	Vel currus.
She could do something for you.	Posset aliquid pro.
Which is so.	Quod ita est.
He wanted to know where he was.	Scire voluit ubi esset.
I absolutely love this thing.	Omnino hanc rem amo.
I think that's what he did.	Id fecisse puto.
in.	in.
He has with.	Habet apud.
If this were true, he could say the truth.	Si hoc verum esset, posset verum dicere.
But that is before.	Sed id est ante.
No one told me about this.	Nemo mihi de hoc dixit.
I don't think I could do anything about it.	Non puto nihil posse de illo facere.
So it is.	Ita est.
It doesn't seem to matter.	Ad rem non videtur.
Probably no one does.	Verisimiliter nemo facit.
You can hear it.	Potes eam audire.
It was hard for me.	Mihi difficile erat.
Here they are.	Hic sunt.
He was already sure.	Iam certus erat.
It is not easy, it is not really.	Non facile est, vere non est.
It is totally correct.	Prorsus recte est.
He went home.	Abiit domum.
I know him.	Scio eum.
For what.	Pro quid.
He would not.	Noluit.
You know how important it is.	Scis quam magna sit.
Looks like you had a busy day.	Tu similis erat dies occupatus.
I don't know why this is.	hoc cur sit nescio.
But that never was.	Sed id numquam erat.
what I think will happen.	quid futurum puto.
It's too late now.	Sero nunc est.
Next year I needed a plan.	Proximo anno consilium mihi opus fuit.
Now as it was.	Nunc ut erat.
That's nothing.	Id nisi.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
Yes about.	Etiam de.
Now that's it.	Nunc id enim est.
But this.	Sed id.
A lot!.	Sit amet!.
You are absolutely right about everything.	Omnino recte de omnibus es.
No time appears.	Nulla nunc videtur.
My father is good.	Pater meus bonus est.
I will tell the truth.	vere dicam.
I'll do it for you as a person.	Ego te faciam ut homo.
You'd have a good day.	Diem bonum esse velis.
Which is true?	Quod est verum?.
You only do.	Tu tantum fac.
None but him none.	Nulla sed ipsum nulla.
It is not what has been done.	Non est, quod factum est.
It was almost time.	Tempus erat fere.
Has more time lately.	Plus temporis habet, nuper.
It's never just about us.	Numquam res tantum de nobis est.
Today he did not.	Hodie non fecit.
I will do nothing else.	Nihil aliud faciam.
That there is nothing wrong.	Quod nihil est mali.
Tell me about it.	Dic mihi de illo.
The time is now I believe.	Tempus est nunc credo.
That's only one thing.	Id solum unum.
He gave me advice.	consilium mihi dedit.
But who wants us?	Sed quis velit nobis.
The next night.	Proxima nocte.
Not the same after all.	Non simul post omnes.
Just wanted me.	Sicut me voluit.
He would not listen.	Noluit audire.
So it is.	Ita est.
You have three days to get there.	Habes tres dies illuc.
I am getting good.	Questus sum bonum est.
That's a.	Id a.
You know you want to get one yourself.	Scis te ipsum vis accipere unum.
They are not as important as they used to be.	Non sunt tam magna quam esse solebat.
I just think of you like.	Ego iustus cogitare de te sicut.
I have many things to say.	Multa habeo dicere.
I see things as they are.	Video res ut sunt.
And he knew that there was more.	Sciebat autem plus esse.
You have done well.	Recte fecisti.
But he wanted something.	Sed aliquid voluit.
But it was a thing to do.	Sed facere rem erat.
Yes, that was before.	Etiam id ante erat.
The man asked his name.	Quaesivit homo nomen suum.
I've seen how he is with her.	Ego vidi quomodo cum illa sit.
This is good.	Hoc bonum est.
I don't want to know.	Nolo scire.
No one came to her aid.	Nemo ei auxilio venit.
It's good to be home.	Bonum est esse domi.
No he was not himself.	Nulla non ipsum erat.
You want money.	Pecuniam vis.
It was never enough.	Numquam satis esset.
We cannot be together.	Simul esse non possumus.
So good, so good.	Tam bonus, tam bonus.
I just met you.	Ego iustus occurrit vobis.
I don't do it often.	Non id saepe.
My father is late.	Pater meus sero est.
I'm not sure you have a name.	Non sum certus nomen habere.
He went, as he saw.	Abiit, ut vidit.
We don't have it here.	Non id habemus hic.
It is not possible.	Fieri, non potest.
You can do it or listen.	Facere vel audire potes.
It is important to be great.	Aliquam sit amet magna.
Yesterday was a man.	Heri homo erat.
He was in himself now.	In se nunc erat.
It was very nice.	Erat admodum.
I'm going to help.	Eo auxilium.
He would not listen.	Noluit audire.
You'd better go.	Ire melius velis.
Absolutely what you need.	Omnino quod debes.
He wants to do it himself.	Ut id velit ipsum.
I don't think it's possible.	Non puto posse.
When you have everything.	Cum omnia habes.
I can do it now.	Id nunc facere possum.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
Something new.	Aliquid novi.
I am a teacher.	Ego magister sum.
I didn't want her to do more than she wanted.	Nolui eam facere plus quam vellet.
What are people and why.	Quid homines et quare.
He did not know what was going to happen.	Quid futurum esset nesciebat.
It's easy to save money.	Facile pecuniam.
It's true.	Suus 'verum.
There is no order now.	Nulla ut nunc est.
About me	De me.
You need to go there.	Opus est tibi illuc ire.
All the best, though.	Omnia optime, sed.
There just isn't much.	Ibi tantum non multum est.
But it is something.	Sed aliquid est est.
You have friends.	Vos habere amicos.
I know you say yes	Scio te etiam dicere
She's got to do it.	Illa obtinuit ut id.
I know how to help	Scio quid adiuvet
There was no man anymore	Homo non erat amplius
It is good.	Bene est.
I'm sure you don't know	Certus sum non scire
I have to talk to you	Habeo loqui ad vos
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
But there was neither nor no.	Sed nulla nec erat nec vel.
not from his friend.	Non ex suo.
I didn't say anything like that to you	Non aliquid simile quod ad vos
Maybe if things were right.	Forsitan, si res recte.
He wanted to know where he was.	Scire voluit ubi esset.
That's how he played.	Id quam ipsum.
I'm almost here for work	Fere huc me ad opus
It is good.	Bonum est.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum enim.
But he would not do this.	Hoc tamen nolebat.
Now I'm all the way to you.	Nunc omnes iter faciam tibi.
I really want you to help	Ego vere volo te ad auxilium
If it could be done.	Si fieri posset.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
I don't need any friends out there	Non necesse habeo amicos de aliquo ibi
I've never seen that place before	Ego numquam vidi illuc ante
I just want to do this now	EGO iustus volo ut hoc modo
To me it seems right.	Mihi recte videtur.
I want to do	Volo facere
it seems scarcely enough to say for him.	vix satis videtur pro illo dicere.
I knew everything about him	Sciebam omnia de eo
But she did it.	Illa tamen fecit.
What should i do for you.	Quid faciam tibi.
I believe that I can only see you.	Credo te solum videre non posse.
He wanted to give it.	Voluit illud dare.
I can't do the things	Ego non possum facere quae sunt
That's always.	Id semper.
That's what's going to happen to us.	Id nobis futurum.
He was no longer his dog.	Iam canis eius non erat.
But here you are.	Sed hic tu.
After many years he gave him a better name.	Post annos melius ei nomen dedit.
This is a good deal.	Haec multum a.
He didn't, you know.	Non fecit, tu scis.
A little more time is what you should do	Paulo plus temporis est quod facere debet
It's not bad.	Malum non est.
I think the same thing.	Idem puto.
Certainly to me.	Mihi certe.
already pretty bad	Iam satis mali
And that was it.	Erat autem id.
tell me what you know.	dic quid scis.
I am not so sure now.	non ita nunc certus sum.
You owe us nothing.	Nobis nihil debes.
I'd never asked it	Vellem illa non quaesivit
You can do it again.	Iterum facere potes.
I need to do something	Mihi opus est ad aliquid
And it will be.	Et erit.
I don't want to go.	Non me vis ire.
Nothing will do it.	Nihil facturus est.
I am happy for him	Felix sum eum
I don't think it's going to be	Non puto futurum
It was not enough.	Parum fuit.
I want to talk about you	Volo loqui de te
That is not here	Id quod hic non est
I thought it was easy	Facile putavi
I saw this at the time and thought.	Vidi hoc tempore et cogitavi.
I hope you know what	Spero autem quod scis
I see the future with you	Video futurum apud te
I didn't know when to stop	Ego nesciebam, cum prohibere
I still don't really.	Ego tamen non vere.
I think we are different	Puto aliud sumus
Maybe he thought that there was nothing wrong with it.	Forsitan id nihil mali putabat.
We like it a lot	Multum nobis simile est
He likes to go and stay again.	Velit ire et iterum manere.
But if not you indeed .	Quod si nec tu quidem .
What else do you need?	Quid aliud tibi opus est?.
It is good to be there again.	Bonum est iterum ibi esse.
This is after only one day.	Et hoc est post unum tantum diem.
I don't know what's best for the season	Nescio quid melius tempore
I really don't want to see	Ego vere noluit videre
I didn't know my father	Ego nesciebam pater
now is the time for me to do it.	hoc tempus nunc mihi id faciam.
I know you don't want to be	Scio te non vult esse
I will definitely order from you again.	Certus sum ut a te iterum.
But there was only one.	Sed non erat nisi.
But something goes wrong.	Sed quid eat mali.
I will be making sure	Ego certus esse faciens
I don't have to tell anyone	Non habeo dicere quis
Always get to work at night	Semper ut opus nocte
I don't think there is anything wrong with that.	Non puto quicquam mali in eo esse.
There was a lot more to do.	Multum erat ei amplius facere.
I don't know who started	nescio quis incepit
Don't talk to me.	Noli mihi dicere.
But come with us really.	Sed vere nobiscum venire.
You or me, we are the same.	Tu an' me, nos idem sumus.
I wonder where we are	Miror ubi sumus
I know it was not.	Scio non fuisse.
It is what we are.	Est quod sumus.
I was a good guy.	Bonum guy fui.
All in one.	Omnia in una.
thinking about you	Cogitas te
And this too.	Et haec quoque.
That's pretty much it.	Id satis multa.
For to speak is the same.	Idem est enim loqui.
When he wanted to.	Cum vellet.
I don't even see	Non quidem videre
I have said so often.	Ita saepe dixi.
You'll never want to know	Numquam vis scire
and time is.	et tempus est.
At the same.	Ad idem.
I just left him	Ego iustus reliquit eum
I'm not sure what to do now	Non certus sum quid nunc facere
I just want it so long	EGO iustus volo non tam diu
I am not yet sure.	nondum certus sum.
I've done her work	Ego feci ei opus est
I know that someone is getting help from	Ego scio quod aliquis ex auxilium questus est
Which was	Quod erat .
I don't like it now	Non placet nunc
Now she goes, the thing is.	Modo venit, res est.
I could scarcely see what was before me.	quod ante me fuit, vix videre potui.
Think about it.	Cogitare de illo.
But there is only one.	Sed non est nisi.
There's some fun to choose.	In sit amet aliquam velit.
This is good for me.	Hoc mihi bonum est.
He saw not, he understood.	Vidit non intellexit.
I really like that guy	Ego vere amo ut guy
I think I don't even know that.	Ne id quidem scire puto.
I don't think you'd understand	Non puto velis intelligere
You have yet to get there.	Habes adhuc illuc.
It is certain for me.	Certum est mihi.
I don't think so.	Non puto esse.
But it is well.	Sed bene est.
I really need help	Ego vere opus auxilium
I told him everything about you	Dixi ei omnia de te

I'm not sure what she did now	Non certus sum quod illa nunc fecit
I am alone.	Solus mihi.

I have to understand what this means	Habeo intelligere quid hoc modo
I will not do it	Non faciam eum facere

There is no way to love it.	Nulla ut ipsum enim.
Mine doesn't have.	Meus non habet.
I was with him, and I would be soon.	Cum eo eram, et me mox fore.
It would seem that this is not so.	Videtur hoc non ita esse.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
But nothing is right.	Sed nihil recte.
That's what it was.	Id quod non erat.
See if you can really do it.	Vide, si vere id facere potes.
And don't leave her alone	Et non solum relinquere eius
Both of you.	Vobis utrumque.
I just listen to it	Me solum audire eam
But his a.	Sed eius a.
We have some to see who it is.	Habemus aliquam ut quis sit.
Do these things now.	Fac modo haec.
I thought to what he said	Cogitavi ad id quod dixit
That's a lot of fun.	Ut sit amet dictum est.
I can't see what's happening	Quod fieri non possum videre
I'm glad you did	Gaudeo quod fecisti
He doesn't want to do this.	Hoc facere non vult.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
Even he never saw him.	Etiam numquam ipsum vidit.
It's still there.	Est adhuc ibi.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
But that is only.	Sed id est nisi.
Don't talk to me.	Non est me loqui.
That is, yes.	Id est, sic.
And this was not enough.	Et hoc non erat satis.

It was said.	Dictum erat.
There's nothing to see.	Nihil est ibi videre.
These things are not.	Haec non sunt.
I don't know today	Nescio hodie
What could have been done.	Quod fieri potuit.
You know everything.	Scis omnia.
He says similar things.	Similis haec dicit.
I want you to know him	Volo te scire eum
Not even that.	Ne illud quidem.
This doesn't seem too hard for me.	Hoc mihi difficile non videtur.
I love money.	Pecuniam amo.
And this cannot be good.	Et hoc bonum esse non potest.
The morning was not the same.	Mane idem non fuit.
I want someone to help me or just me	Volo aliquis ut adiuvet me, vel sicut me
I hope he's not home	Spero autem non est in domum suam
I just feel alone	Ego iustus sentio solus
He told me to do this one more time.	Dixit me hoc unum tempus facere.
I was always, always, and always.	Semper, fui, semper, et semper.
If you don't want to be her, it's fine.	Si eius esse non vis, bene est.
He really told me something.	Hoc vere dixit mihi aliquid.
You are like.	Similis es.
I could think of it again	Non potui cogitare de illo iterum
i think people have always been men	Puto homines semper fuisse homines
We have everything here.	Omnia hic habemus.
I can't say anything	Non possum dicere aliquid
He understood.	Intellexit.
I am a man and a father	Ego vir et pater

I just didn't get what I wanted	Ego iustus non eam quod voluit
If you don't have it, you want really bad.	Si non habes, vere malum vis.
I just want to stay together	Ego iustus volo manere simul
I thought I would love you	Putavi ut amo
But it doesn't surprise you or me.	Sed non miror te vel me.
I want to talk to both	Volo loqui ad utrumque
This is true.	Hoc verum est.
That's what he said.	Id dixit.
I doubt but perhaps	Dubito, sed fortasse
I need it	Mihi opus sit ei
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
but he knew nothing.	sed nihil sciebat.
You can hardly understand.	Vix fortasse intelligere potes.
I never thought about you before.	Numquam ante te cogitare.
I just want to make sure you don't go with him	EGO iustus volo fac tibi non cum eo
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
I really like it here	Ego vere amo is hic
I always	Ego semper
There was no problem.	Quaestio non fuit.
This I have to give to you	Hoc habeo dare tibi
I need to tell you something.	Mihi opus est tibi aliquid dicere.
I hope for sure.	Spero certe.
I just be me	Ego iustus esse me
I did not do it.	id non feci.
I want to be here with me	Volo hic mecum
Hard to live for me	Mihi difficile vivere
I am the only person there	Ego solus homo ibi
I just can't see it that way.	Modo non video eam illuc.
Let no one help me	Nemo me adiuvet
I can't say anything more than	Non possum dicere aliquid plus quam
I will say that up front.	Dicam quod usque ante.
Nothing I can say.	Nihil possum dicere.
Not great, but good.	Non magna, sed bona.
I'm glad you're here!	Gaudeo te hic esse!
The design is similar.	Consilium est simile.
Certainly you cannot.	Certe non potes.
But who can do it himself.	Sed quis ipsum facere.
Even now I wasn't really sure why.	Etiam nunc non erat vere certus quare.
But it is great.	Sed magna est.
I can not be able to	Non possum non posse
She thought he didn't even understand it.	Putavit ne id quidem intellexit.
This just makes everything look great.	Hoc modo facit omnia magna vide.
It's big enough.	Satis magna est.
I never want to see her again	Numquam vis videre eam iterum
I'm not sure about any of it	Non certus sum de aliquo ex eo
Well he said nothing.	Bene nihil dixit.
I won't do it anymore.	Non faciam amplius.
To be, to be.	Esse, ut ut.
I completely understand	Ego omnino intelligere
But he says nothing.	Sed nihil dicit.
I know you are very busy	Scio te valde occupatus
It was not enough.	Parum fuit.
It's your name.	Est nomen.
Much needs to be done.	Multum necesse est fieri.
He could do nothing.	Nihil potuit.

There's also a lot to talk about about this.	Ibi multum loqui de hoc quoque est.
I can't act anymore	Non possum agere posse
I just did what I had to do	Ego iustus fecit quod ad me ut faciam
It may be time for something else.	Forsitan tempus aliud.
Or he likes it.	Vel velit.
I've never met him.	Nunquam ei occurrit.
We can't do it.	Non possumus facere.
I knew he was	Sciebam eum fuisse
For a long time he said nothing.	Diu nihil dixit.
I need to do something.	Mihi opus est ad aliquid faciendum.
Now it is good.	Nunc bona est.
Do it quickly.	Fac cito.
This has not happened to me very much	Hoc factum non est mihi valde
I just saw it happening	Ego iustus vidit fieri
I saw something there	Vidi quod ibi
I have seen you for a long time	Vidi te diu
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
I tried to talk about it.	Conatus sum de eo loqui.
Here and now.	Hic et nunc.
No one knew where he was.	Nemo scivit ubi esset.
And you will do the same.	Et tu idem facias.
I want to be someone	Volo ut sit aliquis
I want to do everything with you	Volo facere omnia tecum
He wasn't sure what to do next.	Non erat certus quid faciendum.
I was not.	non eram.
I need to ask you	Mihi opus est ut a te
He wants to get some.	Et aliquam velit ut.
You've done it.	Fecisti id fieri.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
I need to know what's wrong	Mihi opus est scire quid mali
I have many things to say to you	Ego multa habeo tibi dicere
I really appreciate if you didn't say anything about it.	Ego vere bene si quid de eo non dixisti.
It's not just me	Non solum hoc mihi
What a fun thing.	Quam rem amet.
He had to go to her.	Habuit ad eam.
for sure I have made it	pro certo habeo eum fecisse
I couldn't say that	Non potui quod
I don't know what it is	Nescio quid sit
This work is my work	Hoc opus est mihi opus

We are not yet there.	Nondum ibi sumus.
I want you to find it	Volo te invenire eam
I've never seen this bad bad before.	Numquam malum hoc malum ante.
I was ready to speak	Paratus eram loqui

i am you.	ego sum tu.
I heard what happened today	Audivi quod factum est hodie
This work is like e	Hoc opus est ut e

I don't want to go	Non vis ire
You are exactly right.	Recte prorsus es.
I will say this.	Hoc dicam.

I need to talk to you	Mihi opus est loqui ad vos

It's not just about tonight.	Hoc non solum de hac nocte.
I was ready to speak	Paratus eram loqui
I do not know.	Non scio.
I hope you know	Spero te scire
I forgot to tell you yesterday	Oblitus sum tibi dicere heri
To never ever.	Ut numquam semper.
I don't have to see.	Non habeo videre.
I don't have anything to say	Non habeo quod dicam
I know how hard it is for you	Scio quam difficile sit tibi
I will not be able to	Ego non posse
But he already knew who was there.	Sed iam sciebat quis ibi esset.
Not soon enough.	Non satis cito.
I've done it all for me	Ego feci ei omnia ad me
We can do this again.	Iterum hoc facere possumus.
This is too much.	Nimium hoc.
I know you a whole lot	Scio te totum multum
It was done the year after.	Anno post factum est.
It was great.	Erat magna.
I don't have to go anywhere	Non habeo huc ire
He could not see enough.	Non potuit satis videre.
I knew it was true as much as I did	Sciebam verum esse quantum fecit
It is not true.	Non est verum.
Yes it is, this is not me.	Ita est, hic non est me.
I'm not really a lunch person	Ego vere prandium homo non est
For in none.	In nulla enim.
I don't have time for you	Non tempus tibi
a lot indeed	Multum quidem
That's just good.	Sic tantum bonum.
I just want you to know this can be done	Ego iustus volo te scire hoc fieri
I finally got some work	Ego tandem aliquid opus obtinuit
It's time to be yourself.	Aliquam ut quam ipsum.
I can't believe I'm not the first	Non possum credere me non primum
I don't know whether it is true.	Nescio an verum sit.
I thought I was alone	Solus me esse putavi
I want to do something about it.	aliquid de eo agere volo.
He was not here.	Hic non erat.
I wanted to know what's wrong with me	Volui scire quid mali me
And it looks not so good.	Et spectat non ita bonum.
I could not leave it.	Non potui eam relinquere.
I need some time for me	Mihi opus est aliquo tempore ad me
I can't see.	Non possum videre.
But what if one were to do it?	Sed quid faceret si unus.
I thought that's okay with that	Cogitavi quod bene cum illo
Or your time today.	Vel tempus tuum, hodie.
I really don't know anything else	Ego vere hoc non aliud
I don't have time for you.	Ut non tempus enim.
To go into business.	Ire in rem.
I've heard everything there	Audivi omnia ibi audire
I knew what I needed	Sciebam quid mihi opus esset
Just take a look at the text.	Vide mox in illud.
Well, that day is today.	Bene, dies ille est hodie.
There'd be more than one car out there.	Plus currus unus et ibi esse velis.
I don't know what the problem is	Nescio quid sit quaestio
This is not easy.	Hoc non est facile.
I haven't seen him	Ego non vidi eum
He loves this one way too much.	Hic modo ille nimis amat.
He didn't want to see her when she came home from school.	Noluit eam videre cum e schola domum venit.
I don't know how he did it.	Nescio quomodo id fecerit.
I still have a lot of help	Ego tamen non multum auxilium
What could have been done.	Quod fieri potuit.
What have I done?	Quid ego feci.
I just didn't want to hear it	Ego iustus noluit audire eam
He has something for us.	Habet aliquid de nobis.
I see a lot of it.	multum eam video.
i can do so much better.	multo melius facere possum.
This is no longer a problem.	Hoc iam non est quaestio.
What's going to happen?	Quid futurum est?
I know you're there tonight	Scio te ibi nocte
But at least no one knows.	Sed certe nemo scit.
I just want more	EGO iustus volo plus
I thought too	Cogitavi nimis
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
I can't get that chance	Non possum accipere quod forte
I will not do it today.	Non faciam hodie.
It was not yours.	Non erat tuum.
Please don't do it.	Quaeso ne feceris.
I like it now.	Placet hoc nunc.
I wanted him to do it.	Eum facere volui.
I just want you to be happy	EGO iustus volo vos ut felix sit
Yes i'm so sorry.	Ita sum ita paenitet.
I don't really love you.	Non vere amo.
I don't need it anymore.	Non mihi iam opus est.
He's always very happy.	Hic sit amet ipsum semper.
I couldn't do it yet	Non potui facere adhuc
Not me alone, but all.	Non me solum, sed omnes.
I never believe in.	Numquam in.
It was something else.	Aliud fuit.
But not tonight, no, not tonight.	Sed non hac nocte, non, non hac nocte.
I want you to think about this	Volo te cogitare de hoc
She said bad things about me.	Quae dixit de me malum.
I didn't want you to know what my father did.	Nolui te scire quid pater meus fecerit.
I see, yes.	Video, etiam.
What he wanted, he could not do.	Quod vellet, non potuit.
I told you to sit	Dixi vobis ut sit
for he knew what was necessary to tell.	Sciebat enim quod opus erat narrare.
And see what happened.	Et vide quid acciderit.
Do this.	Hoc fac.
I could not do it	Non potui facere ei
I may not be there with you	Ut non ibi tecum
Something else.	Aliquid aliud.
This is not true.	Hoc non est verum.
I don't have anything	Non habet quicquam
I saw what I could do	Vidi quid posse
I need to talk to her	Mihi opus est loqui eam
I don't really understand what it was	Non vere intelligere quid esset
You need to do it yourself.	Opus fac tibi.
I saw nothing wrong.	Nihil vidi mali.
I think she's in it	Puto quae est in illa
You don't want to see this	Hoc non vis videre
I met him in school.	eum in schola habui.
I just want to see how you do it	EGO iustus volo video vidi quomodo te facere
I don't know whether it is so.	Nescio an ita sit.
I hope to go and win.	Spero ire et vincere.
And that's what you want.	Id quoque velis.
I never wanted to say it again.	Numquam iterum dicere volui.
And it was done.	Et factum est.
Which perhaps isn't much.	Quod fortasse non multum est.
He refused to see.	Noluit videre.
I need to say something	Mihi opus est dicere aliquid
Too little time to think about the future	Parum tempus est cogitare de auxilio fore
sorry for being a little late	Paenitet me esse paulo nuper
But the time is like now.	Sed tempus est ut nunc.
I didn't hear anything at home.	Nec quicquam domi audivi.
I know someone who can help	Scio aliquem qui adiuvet
I never had anything to do with that.	Numquam aliquid facere cum ut.
If you want to live, it's fine.	Si ita vis vivere, Bene est.
I can't think of this too	Non possum cogitare de hoc nimis
I will stop all that tomorrow	Ego prohibere omnia quae cras
i think that is work	Puto ut sit opus
There is no reason to think	Non est cogitare
And now is the time.	Et nunc tempus est.
But that has nothing to do with truth.	Sed id nihil ad verum.
sorry for that today	Paenitet me quod hodie
I want to be more than anything wrong	Volo plus quam quicquam mali esse
I couldn't get it anymore	Non potui accipere eam amplius
I saw you today.	Vidi te hodie.
I know you could have yours	Scio te posse habere tuum
But I am not	Ego autem non est
I could not understand.	Intelligere non potui.
We're not just talking to you.	Non solum nos tibi dicere.
No you don't like it.	Nec tu, non placet.
It's not much.	Non multum est.
I thought I got it too	Ego quoque habeo, putavit
I don't even know for sure.	Ne id quidem certo scio.
I could not go on	Ire non potui
You have done this.	Hoc fecisti.
Now I can speak.	Nunc loqui potest.
I could help me	Non potui auxilium me
Got it again today.	Obtinuit hoc iterum hodie.
I had very good help	Ego quoque ipsum bonum auxilium
I can not.	Non possum.
What about	Quid de .
I could not get the money	Pecuniam non potui
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
I was not sure what, but it was true.	Non certus eram quid, sed verum erat.
Well, a lot.	Bene, multum.
I will say nothing.	Nihil dicam.
I haven't thought like that before	Non cogitavi ut ante
but he did the thing.	sed rem fecit.
I want to be a teacher.	Ego magister esse volo.
I probably don't have to say anything	Ego probabiliter non habeo dicere quod
This is not	Non est hoc
I need to talk to you too	Mihi opus est loqui ad vos et
Just got my name this morning	Hoc solum nomen obtinuit me mane
Which is yours.	Quod tuum est.
I don't know why the boy wants	Nescio cur puer velit
I think he really loves me.	Puto hic vere amat.
I just don't think about it that way	Modo non cogitare de eo illuc
I can't say anything more	Non possum dicere quicquam amplius
He never did it there.	Nunquam ibi fecit.
He wanted me to stay there.	Ibi me manere voluit.
We are indeed.	Vere sumus.
If you know anything, tell me.	Si quid scis, dic mihi.
Don't listen to the teacher	Non audire magister
And you will do it tonight.	Et hac nocte facias.
I was okay with it either way	Eram bene cum eo vel modo
I want him I want me	Volo eum volo me
You're sure to have it.	Certus es eam habere.
I thought you'd understand	Cogitavi velis intelligere
Yes they are.	Ita sunt.
I want to get home for dinner	Volo domum ad prandium
I wanted to see what the future would be	Volui videre quid futurum sit
And certainly it was enough.	Et certe satis fuit.
He did really good.	Vere bonum fecit.
Pretty much something for everyone	Satis multum aliquid pro omnibus
A little later he saw why	Paulo post vidit quare
I see him there.	Ibi eum video.
But that's enough for me.	Sed id mihi satis est.
I wonder what you will do now	Miror quid nunc facturus
I wish this never happened	Utinam nunquam hoc factum est
I told him that it was my car	Dixi ei quod esset currus
All is well.	Omnia bene.
Now I need to see you	Nunc opus est te videre
Time to take some time.	Etiam tempus aliquam.
You might even have.	Fortasse etiam habes.
I like my job.	Mihi placet officium meum.
I want something to say to him	Volo aliquid dicere ei
I can only see.	Modo videre possum.
But that's how it is.	Sed id ipsum quam.
I know I really love this guy	Scio vere amo hoc guy
I like or no.	Ut vel nulla velit.
I feel everything at the same time.	Omnia simul sentio.
I could not speak to him	Non potui dicere ei
I was ready for it	Paratus eram illum
That he did so much good.	Quod tam bonum fecit.
This is not what you want.	Hoc non est quod vis.
No that's none of it.	Nulla id ipsum nulla.
I just realized something	Ego iustus intellexit aliquid
One.	Unus.
Yes, but ever since not always.	Etiam sed ex non quam semper semper.
He was already one-on-one.	Erat iam se in unum.
It's time to buy.	Aliquam tempus emere.
I have to go in now	Habeo ire in nunc
This is not me.	Non est hoc me.
All I can do	Omnia possum facere
Well, not home.	Bene, non domum.
I really have nothing to do	Ego vere nihil facere
I could never do it without him	Numquam facere potui sine eo
I saw her face	Vidi vultus eius
But by this.	Sed hac.
Which is not true.	Quod non est verum.
that is the plan.	id est consilium.
I know you live this	Scio te vivere hac
I can't see what it is	Non possum videre quid sit
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum est.
Not as it was.	Non ut erat.
He wants to know that I'm coming home.	Scire me domum velle venire.
I just want to do a good job.	EGO iustus volo facere bonum officium.
After him!	Post eum!.
I love you	Amo ex te
I did a great job with him	Magna feci cum eo
This is.	Hic est.
I just want you to know	Ego iustus volo te scire
I saw you when I didn't know	Vidi te cum nesciebam
I need to do it now	Mihi opus est ut facias, nunc
Not even a name.	Ne nomen quidem.
He knew something was going to happen.	Sciebat aliquid futurum.
A to come out of that afternoon	A venire ex eo meridiem
You are good.	Bonus es.
He could not even know it.	Ne id quidem scire potuit.
I believe you know something	Credo scire aliquid
I knew he wanted to come	Sciebam se velle venire
I don't need it now.	Non opus est modo.
Maybe it was him.	Aliquam quis erat ipsum.
This is all I need	Hoc opus est ut omnes
He is nothing.	Ipse nihil est.
I am not at all okay with that	Ego omnino non bene cum eo
I don't want to work	Non vis ad opus
I didn't know he was there	Ego nesciebam eum ibi
That's it for some.	Ut id aliquam est.
I wanted it to be the problem	Volui eam esse quaestionem
I really want to know	Ego vere volo scire
he could not speak.	dicere non potuit.
I didn't know it too much	Ego nesciebam eam nimis
I can't get something like that	Non possum accipere aliquid simile quod
I could not do it	Non potui facere
I need to talk to him	Mihi opus est loqui ei
To the day	Ad diem.
I have yet to find someone who does	Adhuc habeo invenire qui facit
I didn't know how to play	Ego nesciebam quomodo ludere
You don't owe them.	Et non debes.
I didn't know what it was	Nesciebam quid esset
It's not much more.	Hoc amplius non est multum.
I looked through him.	Vidi per ipsum.
All is well.	Omnes, bene.
It was not enough.	Parum satis erat.
Maybe it's true.	Fortasse verum est.
That's the kind of thing he wanted.	Id genus esse voluit.
I want you with me	Volo te mecum
He went, he went away.	Abiit, abiit.
That's perhaps it.	Id fortasse.
I can't think of it now	Non possum cogitare de eo nunc
I could see you through it	Non potui te per illum
He understood well enough.	Satis intellexit.
That's the money.	Id pecuniam.
He thought it was enough.	Satis putabat.
I am indebted to you.	Debeo.
I want you all	Volo vos omnes vos
I've been there.	Fui ibi.
Not what it looks like.	Non quod videtur.

I will not make a decision	Ego autem non faciam consilium
I just wanted.	Modo volui.
I really like that	Ego vere amo ut
used to be alone	Solus esse solebat,
That was it.	Erat id.
But in a great way.	In magna nisi.
To be honest here.	Ut hic sit amet.
I need it so badly.	Tam male mihi opus est.
I couldn't believe that	Non potui me credere quod
I believe it to be true.	Credo verum esse.
Which still seems to be the case.	Quod adhuc ita esse videtur.
He could not do it again.	Iterum facere non potuit.
But perhaps something else.	Sed fortasse aliud.
Either way, I would like to win.	Utrumque vellem vincere.
I told you not to be there	Dixi vobis ne ibi
But you know, there may also be something there.	Sed scis, forte aliquid ibi quoque esse.
He didn't do that, but he probably didn't know.	Quod non faceret, sed probabiliter nesciebat.
Not so happy now	Non tam felix modo
Thus he did.	Sic fecit.
It is good.	Bene est.
he was at home.	domi erat.
And so it seems.	Et sic videtur.
Okay and so on.	Bene et sic.
You have me.	Me habes'.
He still loves her.	Ille adhuc eam amat.
I knew exactly what I was doing	Prorsus sciebam quid facerem
That's how important it is.	Ut sit amet quam.
You don't want it, not yet	Non vis eam, non tamen
Yes, please.	Etiam, velit.
He could not do this now.	Hoc nunc facere non potuit.
He had to talk.	Loqui non habuit.
I want her to live	Volo eam vivere
I really like this song	Ego vere amo hoc

You don't want to do that.	Quod facere non vis.
we cannot know.	scire non possumus.
I don't care now	Nolo modo
All my father did.	Omnia pater meus fecit.
That's gonna be great.	Ut sit amet magna.
I want it myself	Volo eam ipse
I don't know what you've been through	Nescio quid per te fuit
Only one time occurred.	Unum tantum tempus occurrit.
Well, a little good.	Bene, parum bene.
But it is enough.	Sed satis est.
It could have been done by me.	Potuit a me factum.
I've never done anything.	Ego numquam quicquam feci.
I thought something like that said	Cogitavi ut aliquid ei dixit
And how did you make me?	Et quomodo me fecisti?
never say anything more.	numquam quicquam amplius.
Nothing pleases me enough.	Nihil satis placet.
what do i do to you	Quid faciam tibi
You are so good.	Tam bene.
When he comes	Cum venit.
I only want to see it	Tantum volo videre eam
I know what this is.	Scio quid hoc sit.
You can see.	Potes videre.
I am for you	Ego pro vobis
He also doesn't want to choose.	Etiam non velit velit.
Nothing has ever been done to you.	Nihil umquam tibi fecit.
It's something you don't always want to see happen.	Est aliquid non semper vis videre factum.
Yes, that's the time.	Etiam id tempus est.
He didn't want us.	Noluit nobis.
if you can speak.	si potes dicere.
It is so easy.	Tam facile.
I've done my job	Ego feci officium meum
He could not say everything.	Omnia dicere non potuit.
And he said to him.	Et dixit ei.
i had the future.	futurum habui.
I would like to say it's not just	Vellem illa non solum dicere
I'm done	Ego feci
I hope you are too.	Spero te quoque.
I never want to be without you	Numquam vis esse sine te
I thought you don't want to see him	Cogitavi non vis videre eum
Think about it.	Cogitare de illo.
Everything was.	Omnia erat.
She could hear him.	Posset audire eum.
I can not.	Non possum.
If you are	Si tu es.
I don't believe you know what to do	Non credo scire quid faceret
And that's something.	Et ipsum aliquid.
By the time we got home.	Per tempus obtinuit domum.
But as soon as he was.	Sed ut quam erat.
You know, man.	Scis, homo.
But not today.	Sed non hodie.
Something I thought was still pretty good.	Aliquid putavi adhuc satis bonum esse.
The first is to say.	Primum est dicere.
Maybe you've tried too hard at this point.	Forsitan hoc tempore nimis difficile es conatus.
But there is something more.	Sed plus est aliquid.
I won't buy from you	Ego non emere a te
I have a great question	Habeo magna quaestio
If not for you than me.	Si non tibi, quam mihi.
She looks like a boy to me too.	Spectat illa nimium sicut puer mihi.
But this does not seem to be the case.	Sed hoc non videtur fieri.
I know for sure who you are	Ego certe scio qui sis
But yes, a great result.	Etiam sed magna ex.
I saw through your plan	Vidi per consilium tuum
And here something.	Et hic aliquid.
There is nothing here.	Nihil hic est.
But this was the time.	Sed hoc tempus fuit.
I didn't know what	Et ego nesciebam quid
He didn't want to be there for a long time.	Noluit ibi diu esse.
I hope it	Spero eum
when it's good.	Cum bonum est.
I have seen many things in it	multa vidi in eo
not something wrong	Non aliquid mali
I have to go to work	Habeo ut ad officium
I told him about it tomorrow	Dixi ei de eo cras
I don't know what happened to him.	quid ei acciderit nescio.
We too.	Nos quoque.
That was ready.	Id erat paratus.
Always.	Semper.
I didn't go to school.	Ad scholam ire non.
I never did	Numquam fecerit
It's not your business.	Res tua non est.
If not for her, everyone thinks that.	Si non eius, omnes cogitat esse.
This will be easy for you.	Id tibi facile erit.
I wonder why you do this	Miror cur hoc
Mine was like me.	Meus erat, sicut me.
So you want.	Ita vis.
Well, as has been said, it has been done.	Bene, ut dictum est, factum est.
Hardly.	Vix.
You need all three.	Omnes tres debes.
It is the same with me.	Idem est apud me.
Looks like a car.	Currus similis.
I barely feel at all	Vix sentio omnino
but he did not say.	sed non dixit.
I knew it was not necessary.	sciebam non esse necesse.
Not exactly so.	Non ita prorsus.
I don't need to go through this	Non debeo ire per hoc
I think you will be through it alone	Puto te per id solum fore
I couldn't see anything more	Non potui videre quicquam amplius
I saw you quite right	Vidi te satis recte
So it is.	Ita est.
No one ever asked.	Nemo umquam quaesivit.
And you don't want this.	Et hoc non vis.
It's a lot of things.	Est multum.
I don't want to say	Nolo dicere
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
Now I see.	Nunc video.
I could not do this without you	Hoc facere non potui sine te
My father is still alive.	Pater meus adhuc est.
I can't do that again	Non possum facere quod iterum
I knew I was acting like this	Sciebam me sic agere
I want to talk about this.	de hoc loqui volo.
I had something to think about	Ego quoque aliquid cogitare de
There was something there after all.	Aliquid ibi post omnes fuit.
I'm out this morning to see her	Ego ex hoc mane videre eam
You know.	Scis.
We'll never do it.	Nobis numquam id facere.
I know people enough to know that	Scio homines satis scire quod
we have that one.	habemus quod unum.
How good is it?	Quam bonum est?.
It will probably be better late at night	Hoc verisimile esset melius sero nocte
I could see again	Iterum videre potui
I can't believe this happens again	Hoc fieri non possum credere iterum
No but how great.	Nulla sed quam magna.
This never is.	Hic numquam est.
I like working alone	Mihi placet opus solum
He told me I need to go.	Ille mihi opus est ire.
Almost sick now	Fere male nunc
I want you to get it	Volo enim vos accipere eam
Most likely this morning.	Verisimile hoc mane.
This does not do	Hoc autem non facit
I heard so much about it.	De illa tantum audivi.
This was only done after I was told.	hoc solum post factum mihi dictum est.
He was there.	Ibi erat.
I myself have done it.	Ego ipse feci.
I can do nothing myself	ego ipse nihil possum facere
Too bad for me.	Nimis malum est mihi.
I have nothing to stop him	Ego nihil prohibere eum
I won't stop with it anymore	Ego cum eo amplius non prohibere
I can live with this now	Cum hoc possum vivere, nunc
If it is not, it is nothing.	Si non est, nihil est.
This is not doing right.	Hoc non recte facere.
And you know who they are.	Et scis et sunt.
We're all a lot of things.	Omnes per multum sumus.
I wish it were true, but	Utinam verum esset, sed.
I could never win again.	Numquam iterum vincere potui.
I want to see you again man	Volo ut iterum vir
It was a little different now.	Parum erat aliud tempus.
I'll go to dinner	Ego te ad cenam
I don't know what else.	Nescio quid aliud.
Maybe not before him.	Aliquam nec ipsum ante.
But this time itself.	Sed id tempus ipsum.
I don't do anything wrong	Non quicquam mali
Take time to yourself	Ut tempus ut ipsum
Now nothing yet.	Nunc nihil adhuc.
No one has.	Nemo habet.
I believe it is the best chance.	Optime credo forte.
I don't need any of it	Non opus est aliquo ex eo
I wanted to be happy	Volui ut felix sit
This does not.	Hoc non habet.
I tried to swim with her	Natare conatus sum ad eam
To order.	Ad Ut.
Or he could not.	Vel non potuit.
You know, you know.	Scis, scis.
Don't listen to him talk	Non audire eum loqui
I am getting so much from her	Questus sum tantum a suo
I haven't seen you here before	Non vidi te hic ante
Yes please.	Ita placet.
I completely forgot	Omnino oblitus sum
Well done to you.	Bene est tibi.
It is much better to buy.	Multo melius est emere.
He could not.	Non potuit.
But it was from none.	Sed a nulla erat.
I didn't know this	Haec ego nesciebam
I don't see who it was	Non video quis esset
And as always.	Et ut semper est.
It was a good decision.	Bonum consilium fuit.
I want this work	Volo hoc opus
I need your help	Opus auxilium tuum
And perhaps he is right.	Et fortasse recte est.
I didn't want to talk	Nolui loqui
I just love that people.	Ego iustus amo ut homines.
I know that it is hard to believe	Scio quod sit difficile credere
To be unable	Non posse
No, not.	Non, non.
You should be able to trust each other completely.	Omnino inter se credere posse debes.
I am still surprised about this.	Miror adhuc de hoc.
Thus it was done.	Sic factum est.
There are three people	Tres homines ibi sunt
And never did	Et nunquam fecit
I want to say that	Volo dicere illud
I can only see the future in time	Non possum solum videre futurum in tempore
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla nisi.
It's very unlikely.	Est valde probabile.
He gave in all things.	In omnia dedit.
I need to be honest	Mihi opus est ut sit amet
I can be what you want to be	Non possum esse quod vis esse
You do this.	Hoc tu facis.
Even now, how nothing was.	Etiam nunc quidem, quam nihil erat.
I love how they are now.	Quam nunc sunt amo.
There was no question if that was going to happen.	Quaestio non erat si futurum est.
This is the first time I wanted to hear	Hoc primum volui audire
I want time to get everything well	Volo tempus ut omnia bene
It's like a lot of time in this way	Multum temporis hoc modo similis est
But I still need this time	Hoc autem adhuc opus est tempore
Well, it's still.	Bene, adhuc est.
I never wanted to be a father	Pater numquam esse volui
I only need someone to talk to	Ego tantum opus est aliquis loqui
I knew I could do it	Sciebam posse et facere
I never saw him again.	numquam eum iterum vidi.
That was the plan.	Id consilium fuit.
I live with whom it was made	Me vivere cum quo factum est
You have one too.	Habes etiam unum.
He says nothing.	Nihil dicit.
That was not done tonight.	Quod hac nocte factum non est.
You don't really need to talk to him this way.	Cum eo vere sic loqui non debes.
School is good.	Schola est bona.
If not, well.	Si non est, bene.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
I need this.	Hoc mihi opus est.
I knew what to say.	Sciebam quid dicam.
I always wanted to know	Semper volui scire
Haven't asked yet, but	Non quaesivit adhuc, sed
i don't know why not.	nescio cur non.
Only one.	Unus solus.
I knew that it was too good to be true	Sciebam quod erat bonum esse verum
I couldn't think of anything to say.	Non potui cogitare quid dicam.
I'm afraid too.	Nimis vereor.
You must come.	Venire debes.
He has not been here for a long time.	Hic diu non fuit.
If it doesn't work, it's a problem.	Si opus non facit, quaestio est.
He has the whole thing.	Totum habet.
Maybe you can.	Fortasse potes.
I feel good about myself.	De me bene sentio.
he said to himself.	dixit se.
let it be.	sit.
I believe you already know enough	credo te satis iam scire
It's a lot better to do.	Multum melius est facere.
He loves just about all things.	Sicut omnia de omnibus amat.
I never wanted to do it.	Numquam volui facere.
I have school tomorrow	Habeo scholam cras
How good is it if I am?	Ut bene sit, si me ?
That which is coming.	Quod venit.
Well and truly.	Bene et vere.
I am sure to find out what it is	Certus sum ut ex eo quod est
Can't say enough well.	Non potest satis bene dicere.
You're getting it.	Sic questus es.
It was not so.	Non ita factum est.
I want you here with me, so	hic te volo, mecum, sic
I've been here before	Ego hic ante
I can only think of what it is like right now.	Non possum tantum cogitare quid nunc similis sit.
And now he thought that he knew all things.	Et iam omnia scire se putabat.
I feel very pleased with me	Sentio admodum cum me
I was like something	Fui ut aliquid
I really go now	Ego vere ire nunc
He could have known when he did too.	Scire potuit, cum nimium fecit.
I can't get it alone	Non possum solus eam
But he did not wish this to be done.	Hoc autem fieri non voluit.
Not at all, and certainly not alone.	Non omnino, et certe non solum.
I'm sorry for that.	Paenitet me factum esse.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
That's only what he wants.	Ut non nisi velit.
Do as much as you can.	Fac quantum potes.
I think it would be the first time	Puto fore primum
But it's not really good.	Sed vere non bene est.
I hope to see you	Spero ad vos
I hope we	Spero nos.
Yes, I really love you.	Vere, vere amo.
I had nothing here	Nihil hic habui, vel
Not only.	Non solum.
Well I was not in school.	Bene in schola non eram.
However, it was not enough.	Tamen non satis erat.
I never saw this guy again.	Numquam hoc guy iterum vidi.
I wonder what this season means.	Miror quid hoc tempus velit.
But at this time he did something else.	Sed hoc tempore aliud fecit.
To give and to give and to give.	Illa dare et dare et dare.
But we are not yet there.	Sed nondum ibi sumus.
I can't hear anything that only	Non possum audire aliquid, quod solum
It's not okay.	Non bene est.
I like it	Mihi placet factum est
I had the money	Habui pecuniam
It's not bad.	Non est malum.
I've never seen that before	Ego nunquam vidi quod ante
I'm afraid of a lot	Vereor ne multum
But often great.	Sed saepe magna.
Well, it's a lot.	Bene, multum est.
I need to get it that way	Mihi opus est ut eam illuc
I thought that was true	Cogitavi quod esset verum
Which indeed is not.	Quod quidem non est.
Well, this is definitely time.	Bene, hoc certum est tempus.
I don't want it	Ego non volo
That's what you know.	Id scis.
That which is not is not.	Quod non est, non est.
I didn't know what happened	Ego nesciebam quod factum est
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
But it is a good thing.	Sed bona res est.
I said you can't.	Dixi non potes.
I can't think of this now	Non possum cogitare de hoc modo
But what happened to this?	Sed quid hoc factum est.
Maybe it was great.	Aliquam erat magna.
I love both, but what do you like?	Utrumque amo, sed quid tibi placet?
I would like to see you tomorrow if possible	Vellem te videre cras, si fieri potest
This was my job as a job.	Hoc officium meum fuit ut officium.
There was nothing that I could do.	Nihil erat quod me facerem.
It can be done, and it can be done well.	Fieri potest, et bene fieri potest.
Quite often I thought about you	Satis saepe cogitavi de vobis
I don't need a lot of time.	Non multum temporis opus est.
I wanted to know what it was	Volui scire quid esset
Now who was out.	Nunc quis erat ex.
He did so.	Ita fecit.
This morning just for me	Hoc solum ad mane me
I thought to see it	Cogitavi te videre eam
She's having a good time.	Illa tempus bonum habet.
There was none.	Erat, nemo.
No one does anything to you.	Nemo te quicquam facit.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
I need to talk to him	Mihi opus est loqui ei
I thought about that	Cogitavi ut de
I can't even believe this.	Ne hoc quidem possum credere.
But it was time for some.	Aliquam sed tempus erat.
This happened again.	Quod iterum acciderit.
Not well.	Nec bene.
It will be better in time.	Melius erit tempore.
I could not act	Non potui agere
And again.	Et iterum.
I'm not so kind again	Ego non tam genus iterum
I am.	Sum.
I could not understand why	Non potui cur hoc
It's bad.	Est malum.
It will be better.	Melius erit.
We didn't get sick from someone	Non male ab aliquo nos fecit
But counsel is counsel.	Sed consilium est consilium.
That's him too.	Ut et ipsum est.
I don't want anything else	Nolo aliud
One day at a time.	Unum diem ad tempus.
He told me so.	Dixit mihi sic.
Now it is.	Modo sit.
I don't have to say too much	Non habeo dicere nimium
No you don't.	Nulla non.
I didn't have to go what she said	Ire non habui quae dixit
I could not tell you	Non potui ad vos
No, but not him.	Non, sed nec illum.
I did like my father.	Ego feci sicut pater.
We are often.	Saepe sumus.
I have to see.	Habeo videre.
There used to be.	Ibi esse solebat.
I want to be like that	Volo autem sicut quod
This is nothing else	Hoc nihil aliud est
He didn't know where he was working.	Nesciebat ubi opus esset.
I could not be seen	Non potui ut videri
I want him to live if possible	Volo eum vivere, si fieri potest
I'm glad to be with you.	Gaudeo quod tibi est.
It's good until now.	Bonum est usque nunc.
And what do you think?	Quid autem vobis videtur?
I very much appreciate that	Ego valde bene quod
He said to her that he was one.	Dixit ei se esse unum.
I didn't know at the time	Nesciebam quo tempore
I was able to do this work.	Hoc opus facere potui.
That is possible.	Quod fieri potest.
I haven't heard anything like this	Non audivi aliquid simile hoc
I didn't know you didn't want me	Ego nesciebam te non vis
I didn't know who	Ego nesciebam quis
I don't really want to see or talk to someone	Non vere vis videre vel loqui ad aliquem
I don't want to be in my home	Non vis esse in mea
I'd like to be there when you do.	ibi esse libet, cum facias.
Of what I love.	De hoc quod amo.
He gave him what he wanted.	Dedit ei quod vellet.
I would be happy if so	Ego felix, si ita esset
I can't talk by looking at you	Non possum dicere per vultus apud te
Almost none or none.	Fere vel nulla.
I wanted to tell you	Volui tibi dicere
I saw it in the afternoon	Vidi eam post meridiem
If you don't, well.	Si non facis, bene.
I couldn't think of anything else	Non potui cogitare de aliud
He would be home.	Se domum esse.
Things never looked better.	Quae numquam vidi melius.
I knew him to be much more	Sciebam eum multo plus esse
i did pretty late	satis feci nuper
You don't need me.	Non opus est mihi.
Maybe he wasn't sure.	Fortasse non certe erat.
It was very early.	Erat valde mane.
One name and another name	Unum nomen, et aliud nomen
I am still here.	adhuc hic sum.
He could not believe.	Non potuit credere.
I can't live with what you did to me	Non possum vivere cum id quod fecit ad me
I'll take a look.	Vide Faciam.
He would not listen.	Noluit audire.
That's what he says here.	Id quod hic dicit.
I'm not sure what to do with it	Non certus sum quid faciam ex eo
Now far too many things.	Iam nimis multa.
This is evil.	Hoc malum est.
I wish she was here now	Volo hic nunc fuit
I could totally get sick of it.	Male ex eo prorsus potui.
Well, really just.	Bene, vere iustus.
But that was none.	Sed id erat nulla.
I knew you'd be	Sciebam esse velis
I could not look much more	Non potui multo plus
You didn't do anything.	Non fecisti aliquid.
I could do something like this	Non potui aliquid simile hoc
It was good to be home.	Bonum erat esse domi.
No one knows his name.	Nemo scit nomen eius.
It was only a short time.	Aliquam tempus erat nisi.
I've done you a real bad	Ego feci tibi verum malum
It is bad enough.	Malum satis est.
I wonder what my father is doing	Miror quid pater sit facere
It will be easy enough.	Satis erit facile.
I think it's still true.	Puto tamen verum esse.
But the thing is great.	Sed res magna.
I want you to stay with me	Volo te manere mecum
He doesn't think about it.	Non cogitat.
Well, that's him.	Bene, id ipsum.
It was just not that.	Erat iustus ut non.
They're there for money.	Sunt ibi pecuniam.
Everything about him lately.	Nuper omnia de eo.
I could not	Non potui
I don't like this until today	Non placet hoc usque hodie
One morning.	Mane unum.
Too much is too much.	Nimis nimis est.
I would like to be there	Vellem non ibi
No one wants	Nulla quis velit.
I just don't need it	Ego iustus non opus est
I hope you all do	Spero vos omnes facere
We can't be just.	Non possumus iustus.
He is ready.	Paratus est.
I just met with him today	Ego iustus occurrit cum eo hodie
He wanted this.	Hoc voluit.
Or not.	Vel non.
Please tell me how you do it.	Dic mihi quomodo id facias quaeso.
Which could not be true.	Quod verum esse potuit.
I don't know if I am right.	Nescio an recte.
Without you this is.	Sine te hoc est.
This one is better.	Hoc unum melius est.
I already knew what it was	Iam sciebam quid esset
that is who it is.	id est quis est.
I have to do this	Habeo ut hoc
He does the same.	Idem facit.
Perhaps he said something.	Dixit fortasse aliquid.
I think it would be probable.	Probabile puto fore.
That's kind of you.	Id ex vobis est.
I am not a morning person.	Mane homo non sum.
But he could not do this.	Sed hoc facere non potuit.
She could still see her.	Posset adhuc videre eam.
You know well.	Scis bene.
Absolutely stay here again.	Omnino hic manere iterum.
that was also my plan.	id quoque consilium meum fuit.
To sit.	Ut sit.
Tried again yesterday	Conatus iterum heri
Never before.	Numquam ante.
day and day	Dies et dies.
so sorry.	ita me paenitet.
He would not hear me.	Noluit me audire.
She asked me to get a job.	Rogavit me ut officium.
I did this to him	Hoc feci ei
It was really good.	Vere bonum erat.
Maybe he wasn't so alone as he thought.	Forsitan non tam solus fuit ut ipse putabat.
Who to do so.	Quis id.
I knew exactly what was going to happen	Prorsus sciebam quid futurum esset
I don't think that's possible.	Non puto id fieri.
I wish you were here now	Utinam hic nunc
I've heard enough	Audivi satis
I could give you work	Non potui dare tibi opus
A very good question here	A valde bona quaestio hic
He wanted to be alone.	Solus esse voluit.
I don't even want to think about it	Non quidem volo cogitare de eo
i don't know what this year will be.	nescio quid hoc anno erit.
Well said she	Bene dictum est illa
It is not really	Non vere est
I've been busy already	Ego iam occupatus fui
You need to do to help us.	Opus fac ut nos adiuvet.
I want you to get home with me	Volo enim vos ut me domum cum
He likes to be out.	Velit ex.
I can see what you mean.	Quid vis videre possum.
He knows too much.	Nimium ille scit.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
I didn't want, but there was a need	Nolui, sed opus erat
I did not hear from him.	non audivi ab eo.
He would not.	Noluit.
I know about him.	de eo novi.
I didn't want to do this to you	Nolui hoc facere tibi
They are there.	Ibi sunt.
I know what to do	Scio quid faciendum sit
I know exactly what it is	Scio prorsus quid sit
It was a good and a bad time.	Erat tempus bonum et malum.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
I just thought about that a	Modo cogitavi ut a
Now is the time.	Nunc id tempus est.
But not much.	Sed non multum.
I knew who was behind me	Sciebam qui post me
This only caused me to think.	Hoc solum fecit cogitare.
I wanted to be all for her	Volui esse omnia ei
You can do well.	Bene potes.
now i have to tell you.	nunc habeo tibi dicere.
Who knew how she was here.	Qui quomodo sciebat eam esse hic.
He had not in himself that which he thought.	Non habuit id in se, quod putabat.
I am no longer home.	Mihi iam non est domi.
Even tried to wish you well	Etiam conatus bene velle
yet I have heard nothing.	adhuc nihil audivi.
But that's not the same thing.	Sed id non ipsum.
Yes, he is here.	Etiam hic est.
I really like it here	Ego vere placet hic
That's what you do well.	Id quod bene facis.
You are a man like me.	Tu es homo sicut me.
He didn't want her to be his wife.	Noluit eam esse suam.
I need some time alone	Mihi opus est aliquo tempore solum
I can help you with it	Ut possit adiuvare vos cum eo
And it began.	Et incepit.
I never feel this again.	Numquam hoc iterum sentio.
Police have not said since.	Aliquam non dictum ex.
I just didn't know what to do with it	Ego iustus nesciebam quid faciam cum eo
Maybe even something more.	Forsitan etiam aliquid amplius.
Now is the time.	Nunc et tempus est.
I told her pretty much everything	Dixi iam ei satis multa omnia
To go to school	Ut in schola
And if not.	Et si non est.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id aliquam ipsum.
I had to take a little	Habui parum accipere
I know for me	Scio enim mihi
I only see that	Non solum videre quod
I will tell him but not me	Dicam eum sed non me
I thought for the first time	Cogitavi primum
let that be.	Sit id erat.
You don't even think.	Tu ne cogitas quidem.
They are there.	Ibi sunt.
If it is, it will always be with us.	Si id est, nobiscum semper futurum est.
But this is not going to happen.	Hoc autem non est futurum.
I knew exactly what it was	Sciebam prorsus quid esset

Never say anything.	Numquam aliquid dicere.
I wanted him	Ego eum volui
I completely forgot to tell you	Ego omnino oblitus sum tibi dicere
Next week!.	Proxima septimana!.
Even more than he wants.	Etiam nec quam velit.
It's probably not even true.	Verisimile non est etiam verum.
And he would not do it.	Et id nolebat.
He just does not yet know.	Iustus nondum scit.
I've heard it before	Audivi ante
I wish you were here	Utinam hic
But this post is not about him.	Sed haec post non est de illo.
We'll see	Non te videre
I didn't know what to say	Ego nesciebam quid dicam
I don't know where my father was	Nescio ubi pater meus fuit
But a little.	Sed paulo.
If you can do it, you have done it.	Si potes facere, fecisti.

I'm sorry, but it's time to leave now.	Paenitet, sed tempus est eam nunc relinquere.
I wanted to talk to	Volui loqui usque

I'm really glad you're alive	Ego vere gaudeo te vivere
This is not me alone.	Hoc non est me solum.
Now I see him at all.	Omnino nunc videre eum.
Whether he wants to be there or not.	Utrum velit ibi vel non.

I tried not to think even	Conatus sum ne cogitare quidem
It's definitely something to do.	Facere quod certum est.
I am not the same	Non idem ego
For he was.	Erat enim.
I like it very much.	Id ipsum libet valde.
Make me like that.	Fac me sicut illud.
Now I need to be with him.	Nunc opus est ut cum eo.
There is only one question.	Una tantum quaestio est.
It is too good to be true.	Est etiam bonum esse verum.
I need a job.	Mihi opus est officium.
I'm not sure that will ever be so.	Certus non sum quod semper ita sit.
I guess I heard you often enough	Suspicor te saepe satis audivi
Maybe it's good.	Fortasse bonum est.
I could not go to school	Ad scholam ire non potui
It's not him.	Eius non ipsum.
I could not know why	Non potui scire quare
I have a lot.	Multum habeo.
I knew my time until	Sciebam tempus meum usque
I thought it would be like now	Putavi fore ut iam
I don't know what's happened to him	Nescio quid ei acciderit

there was only one period.	unum tantum tempus fuit.
I owe you so much man	Debeo tibi tam vir
I know what you want to do	Scio quid vis facere
i knew it was not the same as this	Scivi non idem quod hic

I'm sorry I can't say yes.	Paenitet etiam dicere possum.
He would not.	Noluit.
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
I forgot to have breakfast this morning	Oblitus sum habere prandium hoc mane
This is his.	Hoc suum est.
I'm not trying too hard	Non me conatur esse difficile
So they are the same.	Ita idem sunt.
It was such a difficult time.	Tam difficile erat tempus.
I probably should go	Ego probabiliter debet ire
Be kind to yourself.	Esse genus ad te.
I could scarcely hear even from myself.	vix etiam a me audire potui.
he could have had a better name.	melius etiam nomen habere potuit.
We are here, this we are.	Nos hic sumus, hoc sumus.
See you there soon	Te ibi mox
nor did he know who the father was.	nec sciebat quis pater esset.
Nothing was done that was good.	Nihil factum, quod esset bonum.
I used to go in	Eram ut in
I could not think why	Non potui cogitare quare
There is no pro.	Nulla pro.
I do the job now I love	Facio officium nunc amo

Do what you need to do.	Fac quod debes facere.
I would like to know more about this.	De hoc scire vellem.
sorry for being bad	Paenitet me esse malum
I don't like myself.	Non sicut ipse.
I wish I could see you here	Utinam hic videre
I know you can do better	Scio te melius facere potes
It was not enough.	Parum fuit.
I wanted him to be my first self	Primum ipsum meum volui esse eum
In the morning I am.	Mane ego.
Someone to talk to someone.	Aliquem cum aliquo dicere.
This could not have been done.	Quod fieri non potuit.

Not very good indeed.	Nec bene quidem.
I'll never get home.	Numquam domum faciam.
I can do this, she told him	Hoc facere possum, indicavit sibi

Maybe she could do it now.	Forsitan id nunc facere posset.
I don't like her job	Non amo eam officium
You know this one.	Hoc unum scis.
Nothing to do.	Nihil facere.
I .	Et ego .
It is possible to take this time.	Fieri potest ut id temporis.

I am alone.	Solus sum.

She's got it.	Illa obtinuit.
time to do it.	tempus faciam.
I can't find it	Non possum non invenire eam
Plus, you don't make money.	Plus, non facis pecuniam.
But who was before me.	Sed mihi quis ante fuit.
You said your plan.	Dixisti consilium tuum.
He can do more.	Plus potest.
To get in was great.	Ut in erat magna.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
It is not.	Non est.
It could work.	Posset opus.
Yes, you never know.	Etiam, numquam scis.
Three of us.	Tres nobis.
I saw him	Vidi eum
I don't like when I did this	Non placet cum hoc fecit
You can do it for her.	Facere potes pro illa.
I wanted to talk to you some time now.	Volui tibi iam aliquo tempore dicere.
I need to think about everything	Mihi opus est cogitare omnia per
Maybe it's true.	Fortasse verum est.
Not well.	Non bene.
I forgot to tell you this	Oblitus sum tibi dicere hoc
It was not done, it is evil.	Non sic factum est, id est malum.
I wasn't really sure.	Vere certus non eram.
I wanted to see this	Hoc volui videre per

I couldn't believe what I did	Non potui credere quod fecit
I did the same thing to him.	Idem ego ei feci.
I don't know what is this	Nescio quid hoc
I was not a boy	Non eram puer
I think we have.	Puto nos habere.
Something was going to happen.	Aliquid futurum erat.
he thinks	putat.
I want to see you coming	Volo videre te venire
This looks pretty bad.	Hoc satis malum spectat.
I haven't heard anything.	Nihil non audivi.
I don't like to chat with anyone.	Non placet loqui cum aliquo.
I was single.	essem, una.
But this is for the purpose.	Sed hoc ad rem.
I'm sorry to say that to him	Me paenitet dicere quod ei
I can do it for sure	Pro certo possum facere quod factum est
I think you're not right	Puto te non recte
I knew exactly where to go	Prorsus sciebam quo ire
I want more than anything	Hoc volo plus quam aliquid
I just can't be with you	Ego iustus non sit apud vos
I told me	Ego dixi mihi
I was not tense.	Non fui temporis.
I need to know where I was	Mihi opus est scire ubi eram
I could not wish for something more	Non potui plus velle aliquid
I thought I would be here	Putavi fore hic
I didn't know what could be done	Ego nesciebam id fieri posse
I didn't know he was there	Ego nesciebam eum ibi
I can't do anything for you today	Non possum facere quicquam tibi hodie
Or perhaps.	Vel fortasse.
Doing so much time.	Faciens tempus tantum.
but i'm still fine.	sed bene adhuc sum.
I think a lot of people deal with it.	Multum homines agere cum eo puto.
But it is not enough.	Sed non satis est.
There's not much behind.	Non est multum post ibi.
That's finally there.	Id tandem illuc.
I need to get it first	Mihi opus est ad illum primum
You don't need to know where you want to go	Non opus est scire quo vis ire
And it was.	Erat autem.
I don't really think like this	Non vere cogitare sic
I know me	Scio me
I was not there and no one told me much	Non ibi fui, et nemo mihi indicavit multum
He knew it must be so.	Scivit sic esse necesse est.
But as was said.	Sed ut dictum erat.
I know.	Scio.
Maybe it would be enough.	Forsitan satis esset.
He said all this.	Hoc totum dixit.
But that was great.	Sed id magna erat.
Perhaps this is possible.	Forsitan id fieri potest.
he was still alive.	adhuc erat.
But he did not tell anything.	Sed aliquid non indicavit.
Well, not really true.	Bene, non vere verum est.
and there was another among us.	et aliud inter nos fuit.
I don't want this to happen.	Nolo id fieri.
I want to stay with her	Volo manere apud eam
I never thought of it before	Numquam cogitavi ante
I knew you could find	Sciebam te invenire
I could not believe this	Hoc non potui credere
never asked.	numquam quaesivit.
That's not enough, either.	Parum id quidem.
I just want to be in her hug	Ego iustus volo esse in eius amet
I've heard them all before.	Audivi omnes ante.
Please know what's happened.	Quaeso quid acciderit.
I want him to do my work	Volo eum ut opus meum
That's where he was himself.	Ut in erat ipsum.
I just didn't know how to stop everything	Modo nesciebam quam prohibere omnia
I don't know why, but it was so.	nescio cur, sed ita fuit.
I thought I would be	Putavi fore
I really don't see how that's happened.	Vere non video quomodo id acciderit.
Never, not really.	Numquam, non vere.
I know what it was now	Scio quid nunc esset
I told him to get it	Dixi ei ut eam
I know him to talk to me	Scio eum ad me loqui
Yes, not how it was.	Etiam non quam erat.
You can't do it.	Facere non potes.
He can speak.	Loqui potest.
I tried to think about something else	Conatus cogitare de aliquid aliud
Better than I thought of it	Melius cogitavi ex eo
I know your work very well	Scio tuum opus optime
This was my thing.	Hoc erat mihi res.
You said everything.	Dixisti omnia.
I wanted to do this on my own.	Hoc facere volui meum.
I just know what you did	Ego iustus scio quod fecit
I couldn't even say it	Ne me quidem dicere potui
You are like him.	Similis es ei.
I know you know this.	hoc scio te scire.
I want everything	Volo autem omnia
I really, really did	Ego vere, vere fecit
To get out of this.	Ut ex hac.
I know him better than anyone	Scio eum melius quam quis
I want to apologize for that	Volo paenitet quod
That's what it is indeed.	Id quod est quidem.
Just don't do it again.	Modo ne iterum facias.
You don't have to be sure.	Certo non habes.
I think too me	Puto etiam mihi
That's okay.	Ut bene sit.
Please don't talk about this.	Quaeso ne loqui de hoc.
Maybe that was great.	Aliquam id magna erat.
I made breakfast for	Ego feci prandium pro
i'm still like.	Im 'etiam similis.
I haven't been with anyone	Non fui cum quis
i think it used to be	Puto esse solebat
All this I've done for you	Haec omnia feci tibi
But there is no need.	Sed non opus est.
I just can't get it	Modo non potest accipere posse
I never got to see it	Numquam obtinuit ad eam
It's a good deal for me.	Multum mihi bene est.
And there it is for you.	Et ibi est tibi.
That's never very likely.	Id numquam valde probabile est.
I have nothing to do with you.	Nihil habeo ad te.
He says that he is at home.	Dicit se domi esse.
I haven't quite been there yet, but soon	Non satis ibi adhuc fui, sed mox
I wanted it to be like	Sicut esse volui eam
I wonder who this can be	Miror quis hoc esse possit
Thus we are.	Sic nos.
I don't want to say anything	Non vis dicere aliquid
Something about him.	Aliquid de illo.
Who didn't tell me so much about me	Quis hoc tantum non indicavit de me
He didn't know what time it was.	Nesciebat quo tempore esset.
But it is not the same as alone.	Sed non est idem quod solus.
I wanted all this to be done	Haec omnia fieri volui
By us	Per nos.
As of now	Ut iam
How not.	Quam non.
I just want to talk to her again	Ego iustus volo loqui ad eam iterum
I haven't seen either	Non vidi, vel sic
I love going to work.	Amo opus facturus.
Like a man.	Sicut homo.
So we are too.	Sic etiam sumus.
He says nothing of this.	Nihil de hoc dicit.
I do not do this.	Non hoc facio.
Most likely never will.	Verisimile numquam erit.
I know you want to talk to you too	Scio te velle loqui tibi quoque
I'm not hard to find	Ego invenire difficile non est
Certainly I am.	Certe ego.
And he is .	Et ipse est .
No one before.	Nulla quis ante ante.
I can't give it up.	Non possum illum dare.
Let me tell you the problem here.	Dicam hic quaestionem.
I will post it	Ego post eam
I don't need to use it	Non opus est ut illud
But he cannot have both.	Sed utrumque habere non potest.
You'll never find what happened	Numquam id quod factum est invenire
That's one thing.	Id unum.
You don't have.	Non habes.
Not bad, really.	Non male, vere.
A through and through	A per et per
Yes you have.	Etiam habes.
Please.	Quaeso.
It's hard for me.	Mihi difficile est.
I didn't want to stop	Nolui ut prohibere
It is not hard to find.	Non est difficile invenire.
I have to know something	Habeo scire aliquid
Nothing bad has been done.	Nihil mali factum est.
I can say this, however	Hoc possum dicere, tamen
This is my job and I do this at home.	Id officium est et hoc domi.
Well, no matter.	Bene, nulla res.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
I never forgot	Ego numquam oblitus es
He did nothing wrong.	Nihil mali fecit.
i think not too much	Puto non nimis
I love to be with you	Te amo esse apud te
I am not going to do.	Non sum facturus.
Not long after.	Non multo post.
I don't like it at all	Non placet omnino
You know nothing.	Nihil scis.
Everything is so good.	Omnia tam bene.
He came to me at last.	Venit ad me tandem.
I wasn't sure how much	Non eram certus quantum
Do it yourself.	Fac tibi.
I know what it is	Scio quid sit
I need something new	Mihi opus est aliquid novi
The man who they are cannot help.	Homo qui sunt, adiuvare non potest.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
I don't quite know if you will do it this way.	Non satis scio si hoc modo facias.
I love you that much, yes	Quod multum te amo, etiam
I knew exactly who it was	Prorsus sciebam quis esset
me into something	Mihi in aliquid
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
Which also seems true.	Quod etiam verum videtur.
I wanted to be someone.	esse aliquem volui.
I can't believe it's really mine	Non possum credere est vere esse meum
That's him too.	Ut et ipsum est.
I'm trying to stop.	Me prohibere conatur.
I have seen nothing, nothing yet	nihil vidi, nihil adhuc
Nothing looks	Nihil spectat.
Nothing is much.	Nihil est multum.
I was certain about it	Certum essem de illo
he had to go through a lot of things.	per multum ire necesse habuit.
I knew you needed me	Sciebam opus mihi
I like where this is going	Mihi placet ubi hoc eat
You have this to say.	Habes hoc ita dicere.
But that was already true.	Sed id iam verum erat.
I wanted both, but I could not have	Utrumque volui, sed habere non potui
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
He is now here.	Hic nunc est.
I could not be sure that	Non potui certus quod
I don't want to stay much longer	Non vis manere multo diutius
That day has not yet come.	Nondum venit ille dies.
I wonder if you even talk to me	Miror si etiam mecum loqui
I can't give in	Non possum dare in
You need to know this	Haec scire opus est
Maybe that's just okay.	Forsitan id solum bene.
You know what I meant.	Scis quid vellet.
I think you need it	Puto opus est
This is not bad.	Malum hoc non est.
Tell me what you need.	Dic quid opus sit.
But you can see him.	Sed ipsum videre potes.
Always get what to say	Semper id quod est dicere
You can do so.	Sic facere potes.
Busy, busy, busy.	Occupatus, occupatus, occupatus.
I hope this can help you.	Spero hoc potest adiuvare vos.
We can certainly see that there is no problem.	Quod certe nulla quaestio videre possumus.
I still think you're not here with her	Ego tamen puto te non huc cum illa
He did this one thing.	Hoc unum fecit.
I knew very well from the fact that I was home	Sciebam optime ex eo quod erat in domum suam
You're not good enough.	Non satis es.
Not only what is to be done, but how it is to be done.	Non solum quid faciendum, sed quomodo faciendum est.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
Really very well done.	Vere optime factum est.
It could be something else.	Posset aliquid aliud.
I just want to know you	Ego iustus volo scire te
I need it and I need it	Mihi opus est ei, et mihi opus est
In this way she could conquer me.	Hoc modo me vincere posset.
There are three of us.	Tres ex nobis sunt.
Well, maybe even if you can see.	Bene, fortasse etiam si potes videre.
This is something else.	Hoc est aliud.
It's not that kind of thing.	Non id genus est.
You know you can't think of anything.	Scis te non potes cogitare aliquid.
And it seems to be working.	Et videtur opus esse.
never say.	numquam dicam.
Please, this time.	Placet, hoc tempore.
I certainly wasn't	Ego certe non eram
He knew that he was not.	Sciebat se non esse.
And perhaps she was right.	Et fortasse recte fuit.
we can do better.	quod melius facere possumus.
Maybe not like this.	Ne forte sic.
It's big enough.	Satis magna est.
I could see through here	Per hic videre potui
Just wanted to see her.	Sicut voluit videre eam.
He could not do it himself.	Se facere potuit.
I thought of myself	Cogitavi ipse
I feel the truth.	verum sentio.
I could not get to him	Ad eum non potui
I would not, but it is so.	Nolui, sed ita est.
I like it more.	Placet, amplius.
I certainly wasn't there	Ego certe non erat ubi
It is scarce.	Vix est.
He did not understand.	Non intellexit.
You just asked yesterday.	Tu modo heri quaesivit.
To have something necessary to see.	Habere aliquid necesse est videre.
No one was there that night.	Nemo in illa nocte fuit.
Certainly not too much.	Certe non nimis.
I want you not to say	Volo te non dicere
I'm so bad that	Ita me esse malum quod
And yet it is.	Et tamen est.
I knew you didn't want me	Sciebam te non vis mihi
may not always exist.	Ut non semper est.
I'll never talk to you	Ego numquam loqui ad vos
I had this morning.	Hoc mane habui.
Plus it is all.	Plus est, omnes.
He could have easily done this.	Facile id facere potuit.
I just wasn't sure about it yet.	Modo non certus fui de eo adhuc.
He does not come.	Non venit.
I was completely alone	Omnino solus essem
I don't mean to go like that	Non vult ire sicut quod
I am more than enough to work	Ego plus satis ad opus
I'm not very sick	Ego non male nimis
There is no way to love yourself now.	Nulla ut ipsum nunc.
I don't know what's happened	Nescio quid acciderit
But not him at all.	Sed non ipsum nulla.
But it cannot be.	Sed esse non potest.
That's okay.	Quod bene.
But you got nothing.	Sed nihil ad te obtinuit.
That is his help.	Id est eius auxilium.
He gave it to you.	Dedit tibi.
That's not very likely, though.	Id non admodum probabile, sed.
I can't believe that boy is me	Non possum credere quod puer me est
I need to find it soon	Mihi opus est invenire eam cito
So if this is true.	Ita si hoc verum est.
He did it for himself.	SIBI FECIT.
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
The truth is good.	Verum est bonum.
Now was his time.	Nunc eius tempus erat.
I don't want to believe this	Nolo hoc credere
I need something else	Mihi opus est aliquid aliud
And there is no question.	Et nulla quaestio est.
I would do it now.	Nunc id facerem.
I just want to stay alive and go home	EGO iustus volo manere vivere et ire domum
never say it to him, never	numquam id ei, numquam
I never thought	Numquam cogitavi
Maybe it will be early.	Forsitan mane erit.
I am a very busy person	Ego sum valde occupatus homo
To believe correctly	Ut recte credo
I want us to be friends	Volo nos esse amicos
It was his job.	Eius officium erat.
I have absolutely nothing to do with it	Prorsus nihil habeo quod tibi placet
I think you've said enough	Puto te satis dictum
Good boy.	Bonus puer.
I don't see where there is a problem.	Non video ubi sit quaestio.
Which was better.	Quod melius erat.
I am doing this thing	Ego rem hic facio

Not even about this.	Ne de hoc quidem.
I just live in it somehow	Ego iustus vivere in eo aliquo modo

I believe you need something	Credo opus est tibi aliquid

I wanted to tell you but you forgot	Volui tibi dicere, sed oblitus es

I tried to make it fun	Conatus ad eam amet

I can hardly speak.	vix possum dicere.
I don't want to do it	Non vis ut faciam illud

You look good in	Et ei bonum vultus in
That's another thing he said.	Id aliud dixit.
Where are you also?	In quo et vos?.
Not much, for sure.	Non multum, certe.
I can already feel it happening	Non possum iam sentio fieri
I have not forgotten.	non sum oblitus.
I don't really want to talk to him now	Non vere vis loqui ei nunc
But nothing else.	Sed nihil aliud.
I need to think about everything	Mihi opus est cogitare de omnibus
He was always here.	Hic semper fuit.
I can't believe any of this happens	Non possum credere aliquo hoc fieri
It was good to see him again.	Bene erat eum iterum videre.
I didn't come to the money.	Non venit ad pecuniam.
I couldn't see my future plan	Non potui videre consilium meum futurum est
I could have done this too	Potui etiam hoc et fieri
As it was and so on.	Sicut erat et in.
It was a bad time.	In tempore mali erat.
I just could not think about how bad it is	Modo cogitare potui quomodo malum est
That's what started.	Illa est quae incepit.
I could barely make it	Vix eum facere potui
i think you used to be	Puto te esse solebat
I sit very well	Ego valde bene sit
I need to know his name	Mihi opus est scire nomen suum
This guy just thinks too much about himself	Hoc guy modo cogitat nimium de se
This is going wrong.	Hoc eat malum.
Maybe it's good.	Forsitan bonum est.
I want you gone by tomorrow	Volo te ab abiit cras
We can do it.	Possumus facere id.
I think they play against each other	Puto se in se ludere

We need to think through	Hoc opus est cogitare per
I'm not sure how to say	Non certus sum quomodo dicere
She was right too.	Recte etiam illa.
Everything is great.	Omnia magna.
I would do the same	Idem facerem
That's what you did too.	Id quod tu quoque.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
Never do it.	Nunquam id facias.
Maybe there was no one.	Aliquam non erat quis.
There is no journey from you	Iter a te non est
Who wants to talk about nothing	Nihil velle loqui quis
I thought well and seemed happy	Cogitavi bene et videbatur felix
And what this is.	Et quid hoc sit.
I think you're here to stay	Puto te hic manere
I knew to hear it	Sciebam eum audire
Now that is different.	Nunc quam sit aliud.
Maybe that's too.	Forsitan id quoque.
This made me fun	Hoc me fecit in amet
I'm ready	Habui paratus sum
Maybe not before as before.	Aliquam non ante ut ante.
I told you all about it	Dixi vobis de omnibus eius
I know where to find	Scio ubi invenire
I don't like any of it	Et non sicut aliquo ex eo
I think it's going to be better.	Puto melius futurum.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
Which is not true.	Quod non verum est.
I think tomorrow will be a good day	Puto cras futurum esse in die enim bona
I think about that this time	Puto ut hoc tempore
I could travel with you too.	Tecum etiam iter facere potui.
I would do pretty well indeed	Satis bene quidem facerem
I thought last night	Cogitavi nocte
I don't think he wants it.	Non puto eum velle.
This doesn't seem to be the case.	Hoc non videtur futurum ut putabat.
That is pretty good.	Id est, satis bonum est.
This is what he did.	Hoc est quod fecit.
I couldn't believe what it was	Non potui credere quod erat
he could neither speak nor think.	nec loqui nec cogitare potuit.
I can do nothing	Ego nihil possum facere
I want to know who.	Scire volo quis.
You know what.	Scis quid.
I knew he wanted to live	Sciebam se velle vivere
You can't leave it.	Non potes eam relinquere.
Never leave anything behind	Numquam relinquere aliquid post
I wonder what he is going to do	Miror quid de hoc facturus sit
Don't be like this.	Noli sic esse.
But he wished that he was.	Ut sed velit erat.
I hope you're well	Spero te bene
He doesn't know, he never wants.	Nescit, numquam velit.
I just couldn't be.	Modo posset me esse.
It doesn't mean it's happening	Non vult fieri
But not great.	Sed non magna.
I think we can all get here	Puto nos omnes hic possumus accipere
Even in him only.	Etiam in ipsum nisi.
Which seems very hard to believe.	Quod valde difficile videtur vel credere.
I don't need to think	Non opus est mihi cogitare
I had lunch there.	Ibi prandium habui.
Certainly not for me.	Certe non mihi.
I never thought it would be	Numquam putavi fore
You are one of us.	Tu unus ex nobis es.
I wonder if he likes me	Miror si vult me
Or at night.	Vel nocte.
I want to leave it to him	Volo eam relinquere ad illum
This was done so quickly, that no one was prepared.	Hoc tam cito factum est, ut nemo paratus esset.
I just didn't know how to get out of it.	Modo nesciebat quam ut ex eo.
I hope that's what you like	Spero quod est tibi placet
I don't want to do this the first time.	Non hoc primum vis.
But this is not correct.	Sed hoc non recte.
Or perhaps not.	Vel fortasse non.
I had some work to do	Ego quoque aliquid opus facere
I could, you know	potui, tu scis
It's not as hard to do as you think.	Non tam difficile est facere ut tibi videtur.
I will do this again	Hoc iterum faciam

Ever.	Umquam.

The man does not have.	Vir non habet.
I probably won't be there	Ego verisimile non erit ibi
And yet he did not.	Et tamen non fecit.
He did not say, it was well.	Non dixit, bene fuit.
You can do this easily at home.	Facile hoc facere potes domi.
I think he is for me.	Puto se esse in me.
I didn't want this	Nolui hoc
But this was not as he expected.	Sed hoc non erat ut putabat.
I didn't know what to do.	Ego nesciebam quid facerem.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
It's time to say now.	Aliquam tempus dictum nunc.
We really don't have time to stay longer.	Vere tempus non habemus diutius manere.
And he is well with him.	Et bene est cum illo.
He did a lot of things right.	Multum recte fecit.
I know this to be true	Scio hoc esse verum
This could be bad.	Posset hoc esse malum.
How it was.	Quam esset.
I'm still trying to understand it.	Im 'etiam conatur intelligere illud.

I will do my duty.	Officium meum faciam.
Nothing is good.	Bonus nihil est.
I can't do it from me	Non possum facere a me
It was better this season.	Melius hoc tempore erat.
This, indeed, is seen.	Quae quidem videtur.

I had to give up on it	Ego quod dare in eo
I want to see me again, to see me better.	Iterum me videre volo, melius me videre.
I won't tell you	Ego non dicam tibi
Just about to.	Iustus ut.
I could not speak.	loqui non potui.
I love everything there	Amo omnia ibi
There is none either.	Nulla vel est.
Yes it was not true.	Ita non erat verum.
I just want that one	Ego iustus volo ut unum
When you do this, that is.	Cum hoc feceris, illud est.
I don't think that	Non videtur quod
Today I will not do anything.	Hodie non erit aliquid.
The work is going to be done.	Opus futurum est.
I know who is righteous	Scio qui iustus est
I don't regret it.	Non paenitet.

I did it just in time	Ego feci eam sicut in tempore
I didn't want to do it again	Nolui iterum facere
I knew you	Sciebam te
I really wanted this man	Ego vere voluit hic homo
This means not working.	Hoc modo non est opus.
Please quickly.	Cito velit.

This is not enough.	Hic non satis est.
That's before.	Id ante.
He is alone.	Solus est.
I know what we can do	Scio quid possumus facere
Now I see what it is	Nunc video quid sit
I didn't know what to do with him	Ego nesciebam quid faciam cum eo
Or perhaps that was the case in all respects.	Vel forte id consilium fuit per omnia.
Don't do it for me	Non faciam mihi
I just do what I need on time	Ego iustus facere quod necesse est in tempore
He is very happy.	Sit amet ipsum.
It has to be enough	Non habet esse satis

I don't even know that he has been here for some time	Ne hoc quidem scio eum aliquo tempore hic fuisse
i'm good.	Im bonum est.
I have to tell her where to go	Non habeo dicere ei ubi ire
To work.	Ad opus.
But it was not that.	Sed non erat id.
You know something that can help us.	Tu scis aliquid quod nos adiuvet.
But this was not.	Sed hoc non fuit.
It will probably also.	Probabile etiam erit.
There was none.	Nulla erat.
I don't believe that	Non credo quod

I guess you have to do it tonight.	Suspicor te mihi hac nocte facere.
I told you	Dixi vobis:
I've always been too	Ego semper fuit etiam

I don't like it, never did	Non amo eam, nunquam fecit
Hardly even asked	Vix etiam quaesivit
Not sure if that's the case.	Non certe si ita est.
But you can't do it.	Sed id facere non potes.
I will not.	Nolo.

We can do it.	Facere id possumus.

But he was also himself.	Sed et ipsum erat.
Tell me to be here.	Dic me hic esse.
I never wanted to go.	Nunquam volui ire.
I just can't get to it	Ego iustus potest ad eam
Now that's very important.	Nunc id ipsum magna.
I could see where the problem came from	Non potui videre ubi quaestio ab
Not now, but.	Non iam, sed.
Thus you said.	Sic tu dixisti.
I already tried	Iam conatus sum
Talk about something else.	Aliud loqui.

It seems to be the same.	Idem esse videtur.
You wish to be able to say, you did this.	Dicere tu vis posse, fecisti hoc.
I am always happy to help you	Ego semper felix ad auxilium te
He knew he would never do it.	Sciebat se numquam facturum.
It is no longer necessary.	Iam non opus est.
I knew now	Sciebam nunc
For here he is.	Hic enim hic est.
No one is here to do it.	Nemo id hic facere.
They are not there.	Ibi non sunt.
I barely want to be there with him.	vix cum eo ibi volo.
But he can make his own truth.	Sed suum verum potest.
But it is not so.	Sed non ita est.
You don't have a job at all	Non habes officium omnino
I have nothing to say to you	nihil habeo quod dicam tibi

I can't see the work to do yet.	Non possum videre opus facere, sed.
Nothing else pleases me.	Nihil aliud placet.
I didn't know his plan	Ego nesciebam consilium suum

But neither was there none.	Sed nec nulla erat.
But there is another thing too.	Sed aliud quoque.
You only need to know	Tantum scire debes non
And rightly indeed.	Et recte quidem.
I think it's very, very unlikely.	Puto ipsum, valde probabile.
I can't think of everything	Non possum cogitare de omnibus

I did so.	Ita feci.

The next thing is.	Proxima res est.
Maybe it was.	Aliquam erat.

Are you sure who it was.	Certus esne quis esset.
I definitely wanted.	Certo volui.
I don't want to talk anymore	Non vis loqui amplius

I will do all these things	Omnia haec faciam
I've been with you	Fui tecum

I want to appreciate all your help very much.	Omnes auxilium tuum valde bene volo.
But there is no time.	Sed non tempus est.
I am sure this can be done	Certus sum hoc fieri
It is easy to see.	Facile est videre.
Yes, it wasn't always.	Etiam non semper erat.
I don't know whether the thing is.	Nescio an res sit.
He wants to be with you.	Ipse tecum esse vult.
I can't believe you do this all	Non possum credere haec omnia facit
Right, see what he said.	Recte, quod vide dixit.
I can't do it anymore.	Non possum facere posse.
It's not that.	Non quod.
But that's not the case.	Sed id nisi est.
He understood what he meant to me.	Intellexit quid mihi vellet.
I am always, always have, always want	Semper sum, semper habeo, semper volo
Say it again.	Dic iterum.
I can barely see now	Vix videre possum nunc
I don't have anything to say	Ego non habeo aliquid dicere
This was not easy.	Hoc non erat facile.
I barely said well	Ego vix bene dixit
It is certain what we need.	Certum est quid nobis opus sit.
I'm sure there's something there	Ego certe est aliquid ibi
Only	Tantum.
Well, you still need it.	Bene, adhuc opus est.
I can definitely see why.	Certo cur videre possum.
I have not seen you there.	Ibi te non vidi.
He left nothing of it.	Nihil de illa reliquit.
I want to talk to you about that	Volo loqui tibi quod
He did not wish.	Nec velit.
I didn't do that.	Quod non facerem.
It also seemed similar.	Similis etiam videbatur.
I would not see him.	eum videre nolui.
He said nothing.	Nihil dixit.
I know already about me	Scio iam de me
I want to do it	Volo ut faciam illud
Like a good boy.	Sicut puer bonus.
And it was already late	Et iam sero esset
Yes, I don't always want to.	Etiam non semper velit.
I didn't know about that.	Nesciebam de illo.
Tomorrow is the day	Cras est dies.
I had something for me	Ego quoque quod mihi
I have a little money	Ego parum pecuniae
I know exactly who you are	Prorsus scio quis es
Just trying to say something.	Sicut aliquid dicere conatur.
He understood nothing wrong.	Nihil mali intellexit.
This work he did.	Hoc opus fecit.
I really didn't know what	Ego vere nesciebat quid
But it is not possible.	Sed fieri non potest.
I thought but I wanted to say	Cogitavi sed volui dicere
But this does not seem to have been so.	Sed hoc non videtur ita fuisse.
Who can live with him	Quis potest vivere cum eo
I did really badly	Ego feci rem male
There is nothing in it.	Nihil per.
From which he said, he has not.	Ex quo dixit, non habet.
Nothing in him except	Nulla in ipsum nisi
This work is done.	Hoc opus est.
I don't want any of it	Non vis aliquo ex eo
Yes, but for whom.	Etiam sed enim quam.
There is nothing about him.	De eo nihil est.
I don't really think anything of this	Non vere cogitare aliquid ex hoc per
No one is so happy.	Nemo tam felix.
We still don't have.	Adhuc non habemus.
This could not stop.	Hoc potuit prohibere.
In which.	Quo in.
We'll be well at home.	Bene domi nobis erit.
I want to be there for her	Volo enim ibi esse eam
I forgot where I was	Oblitus sum ubi erat
I have to know what happened to him	Habeo scire quid factum est ei
I really love you a lot	Ego vere amo multum
He is the guy right now.	Is est guy nunc.
I don't have any time	Non habeo aliquo tempore
I just want from you	EGO iustus volo a te
But it's time for the season.	Aliquam sed tempus enim.
I could only one	Non potui nisi unum
It was easy to see why.	Facile erat videre cur.
He is a good guy.	Is bonus guy est.
He was.	Ille erat.
I think you'd better have a look	Puto velis melius habere vultus
It's not too much	Hoc non nimis
if you do.	si feceris.
and he did it.	et fecit.
I wanted to find something new	Volui invenire aliquid novi
I hope that's well for you	Spero quod bene tibi
He could do many things to him.	Multa ei potuit.
It hasn't been long enough.	Non satis diu fuit.
I wonder what you are thinking	Miror quid cogitat
I didn't know what to do from me	Ego nesciebam quid facere a me
And here it may be well.	Et hic ut bene sit.
I know more now than ever before	Scio plus nunc quam umquam ante
I tried to talk about me	Conatus sum loqui de me
You'll never see him again	Numquam videre eum iterum
I really wanted what I didn't say	Ego vere voluit quod non dixit
I quite like how it looks	Ego satis placet quomodo is vultus
That's it for us.	Id nobis est.
I think you already knew	Puto iam sciebat
Tomorrow before noon.	Cras in ante meridiem.
This post is for you now.	Hic post te nunc est.
Maybe that was how.	Aliquam id erat quam.
The situation is the same.	ita se res habet.
No question about it.	Nulla quaestio est de eo.
Father.	Pater.
I don't know what is this	Nescio quid hoc
That being said, I am very happy with this statement.	Ut dictum sit amet ipsum id dictum.
Well no problem.	Bene nulla quaestio.
Not so at all	Non sic omnino
It is bad.	Malum est.
Well, it's a good name.	Bene, bonum nomen est.
I want more than	Volo plus quam
I think my dad really love you	Pater meus puto vere amo te
I was not at all	Ego omnino non eram
I know it looks bad	Scio malum spectat
It hasn't been long.	Quod non diu fuit.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
He is not here today	Non est hic hodie
It doesn't seem quite the same here.	Non satis idem hic videtur.
I never told you that before	Numquam dixi tibi quod ante
Maybe that was it.	Quod fortasse fuit.
Boy.	Puer.
This he certainly knew.	Hoc certe sciebat.
And so as good.	Et sic, ut bona.
A lot of these are very good	Multum haec valde bona sunt
I'm pretty sure you're still doing it.	Satis certum habeo te etiam facere.
I can't say that for sure	Non possum dicere quod pro certo
I listen to him too	Ego quoque eum audire
What is.	Quid est.
That she did.	Id fecit.
but he did not understand.	sed non intellexit.
If you do this through the past.	Si hoc per ante.
I told you all this	Dixi vobis omnia haec ego
He is ready.	Paratus est.
And we.	Et nos.
He knew what he wanted to say, but he did not say it.	Sciebat quid dicere vellet, sed non dixit.
I hope that's for you	Spero autem quod est pro vobis
This is certainly better than doing nothing.	Hoc certe melius est quam nihil facere.
never said enough	numquam satis dixi
But not there, so to speak.	Ibi sed non, ut ita dicam.
At that time it was great.	In id tempus magna.
He has more.	Plus habet.
I could have you	Non potui te habere
Let us know.	Fac nobis, scis.
I always wanted to be like my dad.	Pater meus semper similis esse volui.
But in another job.	Sed in aliud officium.
Not either.	Non vel.
Police said he was.	Aliquam dictum erat erat.
There was one car.	Unus currus fuit.
I can see her face here in	Videre possum hic vultus eius in
he could not be longer there.	diutius ibi esse non potuit.
A little more said he	Paulo amplius dixit se
And not all bad.	Et non omnes mali.
Maybe that's how great.	Aliquam id quam magna.
Tell me why.	Dic quare.
Help is good.	Auxilium bonum est.
I know you love me	Scio te amo me
It was that day.	Erat ille dies.
But no one can see it.	Sed id nemo videre.
It was not that kind.	Non erat id genus.
Not that.	Non id.
He saw nothing.	Nihil vidit.
I can only hear.	Modo audire possum.
Now I need to get it	Nunc opus est ut eam
The problem has never been here before.	Quaestio est numquam hic ante.
I can't see anything else	Non possum videre aliud
I never thought it would happen like this	Numquam sic futurum putavi
I can't really say	Non possum vere dicere
Nothing is wrong at all.	Nihil prorsus mali est.
but where men are.	sed ubi homines sunt.
I could never get away from him	Numquam ab illo potui
I will, but it is not	Volo, sed non est
But there was another.	Sed aliud ibi fuit.
I knew it won't be long	Sciebam non esse diu
Great to see you again.	Magna te iterum videre.
This is what you want.	Hoc est quod vis.
Quite certain.	Satis certum.
i am just trying things out	Ego iustus conatur quae sunt
Paul.	Paulo .
never asked a question.	Non quaesivit quaestionem.
He, indeed, would not.	Ille quidem noluit.
I have been till morning.	usque mane fui.
You'd like him.	Velis eum.
I looked in the room	Vidi in cubiculum
I told him again.	Iterum ei dixi.
I think you know that	Puto te scire quod
You can also do your job.	Etiam facere potes tuum.
I had a little more than a year.	Ego paulo plus quam anno habui.
He never said it.	Numquam id dixit.
I looked better	Vidi melius
What you don't want to know.	Quod scire non vis.
But he could not last long.	Sed diu manere non potuit.
But something else pleases me.	Sed aliud placet.
We're still alive now.	Nunc adhuc sumus.
I won't tell you	Ego autem non dicam tibi
I am scared of the boy myself	Vix sum quam puer ipse
I knew well	Sciebam bene
I like to help you	Ego amo auxilium te
I don't even know it	Non quidem scio eam
that is the thing.	id est rem.
I don't want to go without time after this	Non vult ire post hoc tempore sine
i think it is okay	Puto esse bene
I know what you like	Scio quid simile
That was the same thing.	Ut id ipsum erat.
No one is talking about it lately.	Nemo de illo nuper loquitur.
It can't be.	Non potest esse.
I wonder a lot about it.	Miror de illo multum.
He could not be here.	Hic esse non potuit.
And that's up to us.	Et quod usque ad nos.
I can't see him now.	Ipsum nunc videre non possum.
but today and today only.	sed hodie et hodie tantum.
And this was true.	Et hoc verum fuit.
I was not alone after all	Non eram solus post omnia
I thought I understood	Putavi intelligere
That's not the time.	Ut non tempus est.
But we are the ones who need to do this.	Sed sumus, qui hoc facere debes.
I didn't know for a long time	Ego nesciebam diu
He refused what he saw there.	Noluit quod ibi vidit.
What I have done.	Quod ego feci.
Time is bad.	Malum est tempus.
You need to do whatever you want.	Opus facere quod vis.
Not much more than that.	Non multo quam.
I want to do this work.	Hoc opus facere volo.
I only need to get to you	Tantum opus est ut ad vos
Nothing to say.	Nihil dicere.
You are great.	Magna es.
Nothing else.	Nihil aliud.
I hope soon.	Spero cito.
I'll tell her you don't	Dicam ei ne feceris
I think about the problem	Ego cogitare de quaestio
Everything is still.	Omnia adhuc.
I had to do it	Habui fecisse
I know everything	Ego novi omnibus
No more.	Non amplius.
He can't be seen.	Non potest videri eum.
This morning seems like good.	Hic mane sicut bonum videtur.
He always got that far.	Quod usque eo semper obtinuit.
I told you the truth	Verum dixi vobis
There will be something.	Non erit aliquid.
He was a man. 	Erat homo. 
I could not say the same thing about me	Non potui dicere idem de me
I have to do something	Habeo esse aliquid
I guess we are.	Suspicor nos sumus.
I can't really hear it	Non possum vere audire eam
I generally don't doubt	Ego fere non dubito
I need time to think	Mihi opus est ad tempus cogitare
and the car.	et currus.
I want him here now	Volo eum hic nunc
No one has seen this way.	Nemo hoc modo vidit.
I didn't know you were married again	Ego nesciebam te uxorem iterum
You don't need to know.	Non debes scire.
They get out of nowhere.	Sunt ut ex nulla.
But you forgot, man.	Sed oblitus es, homo.
It's not hard at all.	Omnino non est difficile.
I could not understand	Non potui intelligere
I guess what is happening	Suspicor id quod est fieri
I don't want to travel anymore	Nolo amplius iter
I don't think it was from him	Non puto esse ab eo
That is .	Quod est .
Which is not exactly true.	Quod non est prorsus verum.
But this is not the only option.	Sed haec non solum bene.
This is not easy	Hoc non facile
I know what you mean	Scio quod vult
I thought of you	Cogitavi te
But there is something more.	Sed est aliquid amplius.
I don't want anyone to do it again	Ego ne quis facere iterum
I also need some help.	Mihi quoque aliquo auxilio opus est.
I knew you couldn't	Sciebam te non posse
But this.	Sed hoc.
It wasn't really me.	Non vere mihi fuit.
There is no such thing as none.	Nulla id ut nulla.
I need to see it	Mihi opus est ad eam
he was at home.	erat domi.
something better.	quid melius.
But no one says of this.	Sed de hoc nemo dicit.
I said so to him.	Ei ita dixi.
I don't want to do it	Non vis ut faciam illud
These things are.	Res haec sunt.
Easy to do	Facile facere
I hope you find the time now	Spero te nunc invenire tempus te
There was more to come.	Plus erat venire.
To think.	Cogitare.
i think she did it really well	Puto eam rem etiam fecit
I'd like to have.	Libet habere.
It was certain.	Certum erat.
I almost didn't want to leave anymore	Ego fere noluit relinquere amplius
You have done nothing wrong.	Nihil mali fecisti.
i think this work	Puto hoc opus
No other help.	Non aliud auxilium.
I don't feel anything	Non sentio aliquid
But it was not the same.	Sed non ipsum erat.
This may or may not be what you want.	Hoc sit vel non esse quod vis.
And so I did.	Ita et feci.
Much better than nothing.	Multo melius est quam nihil.
I haven't seen it before	Non vidi ante
Nothing seems to be wrong.	Nihil mali esse videtur.
what you do not do.	quod tu non facis.
To get some more than that.	Ut in aliquam quam.
yes or from ex.	Etiam vel ex ex.
A lot of time together.	Multum temporis una.
I completely forgot it	Omnino oblitus sum eam
He or me.	Ipse vel me.
That's what he did.	Sic est quod fecit.
He was my father.	Pater meus erat.
I need to do what needs to be done	Mihi opus est facere quod necesse est fieri
I don't know what you said.	Nescio quid tibi dixit.
I just need to 'everything'	Modo opus sit, ut 'omnia
I want you to stay here	Volo te hic manere
But enough has been said about this.	Sed de hoc satis dictum est.
I know what you are not	Scio quid non
I hope you love yourself	Spero te ipsum
Maybe that's probably what he does.	Probabile est forte quod facit.
No one does anything per se.	Nemo per se est aliquid.
I could not tell anyone about it	Non potui dicere quis de eo
You are not one.	Non unum.
It was almost always.	Erat fere.
But I didn't want to do this	Sed hoc facere noluit
don't do it anymore	Non faciam amplius
It was a very nice day.	Erat admodum dies.
For some or some.	Aliquam vel aliquam enim.
He came before all.	Ante omnia venit.
I hope you don't surprise me.	Spero te non miror.
What is not seen here.	Quod hic non videtur.
And yet she did this.	Quae tamen hoc fecit.
I know many things from you	Scio a te multa
We have nothing to do with it.	Nihil nobis id.
Well we have, a.	Bene habemus, a.
Well almost none.	Bene fere nulla.
I didn't know this	Nesciebam hic
Yes of him.	Ita eius.
He would not.	Noluit.
I don't do anything else.	Non aliud facio.
I heard what you said	Audivi quid dixisti
You do this, and he knows where we are.	Hoc tu facis, et ille novit ubi nos sumus.
I can't get away from him	Non possum ab eo
Maybe he had.	Fortasse habuit.
But that doesn't seem enough.	Sed id non videtur satis.
I've never told anyone	Ego nunquam indicavit quis
I don't see anyone or anything	Non video quis vel aliquid
Don't be in it yet.	Ne adhuc in eam.
I wonder if he's ever been here	Miror si hic semper fuit
I will hear more from it	Ego amplius ex eo audire
It was a pleasure talking with you.	Felix erat tecum loquitur.
I just did it all together	Ego iustus fecit omnes simul
That was good for us.	Quod bene nobis fuit.
To do something else.	Aliud facere.
Your help, your help	Auxilium tuum, auxilium tuum
That's good.	Id bonum est.
I knew he didn't understand	Sciebam se non intelligere
But that will not be enough.	Sed id non erit satis.
I don't want to talk about it yet.	Nolo tamen de illo loqui.
I need this.	Mihi hoc opus est.
Both are true.	Utrumque verum est.
And soon it is.	Et mox est.
I know how it was done.	Scio quomodo factum sit.
I choose today	Libet hodie

But now he knew the truth.	Sed nunc verum sciebat.
I could not, truly	Non potui, vere
I had a day off from school	Habui ad diem de schola
Enough about me now.	Nunc de me satis.
But that time is not zero.	Sed id tempus non nulla.

I need to say the truth	Mihi opus est dicere verum
I had to stop you	Ego quoque ut te prohibere
Be true to yourself.	Verum ad te ipsum.
I can give you what you want	Non possum dare tibi quod vis
That is not necessary.	Quod non est necesse.
I need her with me	Mihi opus eius mecum
But not before.	Sed non ante.
I was told to come here for a day	Dictum est mihi venire huc ad diem
I know where you want	Scio ubi vis
You have done well.	Bene fecisti.

But who did it?	Sed quis fecerit.
I think it would be	Puto fore
Here's me.	Hic a me.
You know how it could be done.	Scis quomodo fieri posset.
We are not like you.	Non sumus sicut tu.

Now back to reality.	Nunc ad rem.
I have the truth to say	Habeo verum dicere
He knew it would not be easy.	Sciebat non facile.
I've never met you	Ut nunquam occurrit vobis
I believe everybody here.	Omnibus hic credo.
he could scarcely speak anything else.	vix aliud loqui potuit.
I know everything is better than this	Scio omnia melius esse quam hoc
I have something to help you.	Aliquid tibi auxilium habeo.
As stated in the report.	Ut in dictum ipsum.

You'll never know what you will do	Numquam scire quid facturus sit
I know nothing about him.	Nihil novi de illo.
I am sure I can help you	Ego sum certus potest adiuvare vos
Why I don't really know	Cur non vere scio
No one listens to him.	Nemo eum audire.
I really wanted to know	Ego vere scire volui
I don't know for sure.	Nescio certe.
I don't have money	Non pecuniam
I don't feel that way	Non sentio illuc

I want you very badly	Volo tibi valde male
I absolutely don't want him	Ego omnino non vis ei

But he was ready.	Erat paratus sed.
I am following you	Ego sum haec tibi
I could not speak	Dicere non potui
I thought you'd like it	Et cogitavi velis eam
I have a lot of this	Ego multum hoc habere
He can't make money.	Pecuniam facere non potest.
I just can't understand that	Ego iustus potest intelligere quod
But today is a good thing you are with him.	Sed bene res est hodie cum eo es.
I just barely saw him at all	Modo vix vidi eum omnino
And quickly to the point.	Et cito ad rem.

I thought of him much last night	Cogitavi illum multa nocte
Look and see me.	Vide et vide me.

I believe in you and you are in me	ego in te et tu in me

I love you a little	Parum amo te

I can't make that decision now	Non possum facere quod consilium nunc
I would not say anything.	Nihil dicere nolui.
I like you with me	Ego ut te mecum
I have not seen of him.	Non vidi ex eo.
But it was not him.	Sed non erat ipsum.
And rightly indeed.	Et recte quidem.
I have seen evil	Vidi malum
I just want to know what you think	Ego iustus volo scire quid cogitas
don't do it	Non facere illud
I am him for the first time	Ego illum primum
He can't help himself.	Se ipsum adiuvare non potest.
I love everything	Totum amo
I know enough to do	Scio satis facere
I didn't know what it was	Ego nesciebam quid esset
No one is present.	Nulla quis nunc est.
It has been such a good week.	Ita bene septimana sic fuit.
You can tell me nothing.	Nihil mihi narrare potes.
There are certainly.	Sunt certe.
I guess to see, to believe	Suspicor videre, credere
I didn't know what to think or what to believe	Ego nesciebam quid cogitare vel quid credere
I know what it was	Scio quid esset
I did this too	Feci hoc quoque
I could not find him, he could not find me.	Eum invenire non potui, me invenire non potuit.
I can't believe this has happened	Non possum credere hoc factum est
It is important to say.	Aliquam sit amet dictum est.
I don't know where he is	Nescio ubi sit
It is not great.	Non magna.
Not now, not anymore.	Non nunc, non amplius.
You have many things before you.	Habes multa ante te.
I didn't know why	Nesciebam cur
He is everything.	Ipse est omnia.
I was up to something	Fui usque ad aliquid
I need you here with me	Hic opus est tibi mecum
I didn't see him coming	Non videre eum venire
Which indeed was enough.	Quod quidem satis fuit.
To be what he wants.	Esse quod velit.
Now I see what it is	Nunc video quid est
I doubt very much.	Valde dubito.
I love you all very much	Omnes valde te amo
But there was a need to know more.	Sed plus scire opus erat.
I wonder if this is true	Miror si hoc verum est
Not so today.	Non ita hodie.
You have it so well.	Ita bene habes.
So it is.	Ita est.
I don't want to see this	Nolo te hoc videre
I would never come here at all	Utinam nunquam huc omnino
Something here tonight or something not.	Aliquid hic hac nocte, vel aliquid non.
I don't know what that	Nescio quid illud
I wish I could not.	Utinam non.
I couldn't even do it	Non potui etiam facere
But still.	Sed adhuc.
I was told that it would only take three days	Dictum est mihi quod esset solum accipere tres dies
I don't know if you can or not	Nescio si potes vel non
He is like a father.	Pater similis est.
Not even that.	Ne id quidem.
I didn't want to talk to him	Nolui loqui ei
I never did it.	Numquam ex eo quod fecit.
I never forgot that	Numquam oblitus sum quod
He was not sure.	Ipse non erat certus.
I didn't know him all that well	Ego nesciebam eum omnia, quae bene

It is correct.	Recte est'.
To leave.	Relinquere.
I just don't like what she's saying	Ego iustus non similis quid illa dicere
It's time to stop.	Aliquam nec ante ex.
You have to know.	Scire habes.
I haven't thought anything of it	Non cogitavi aliquid ex eo
It would seem that this is true.	Videtur quod hoc verum sit.
But man ought to believe something.	Sed homo debet aliquid credere.
He knows nothing.	Nihil scit.
He wanted more.	Plus voluit.
i can see it.	eam videre possum.
Certainly not in the near future.	Certe non in proximo.
It's going to be better for you.	Melius futurum est tibi.
And I like it.	Et placet.
I can only see in this way.	Tantum hoc modo videre possum.
I did everything myself.	Omnia feci ipse.

I am still only one	Ego tamen, nisi unum
I am just trying to understand this	Ego iustus conatur intelligere hoc
It was finally time to go.	Tempus erat tandem ire.
Or his evil.	Vel eius malum.
I couldn't believe things about me	Non potui credere sunt de me
I don't know how it was there	Nescio quomodo fuit ibi
I am one and you	Ego sum unus et tu
I love you, but now I need to go	Te amo, sed nunc ire necesse est
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
I could not do all things without you	sine te omnia facere non potui
I can't help yet.	Non possum adhuc.
I did this for me	Hoc feci mihi
I could not believe	Non potui credere
And these are many.	Et haec sunt multa.
Maybe that was him.	Aliquam id erat ipsum.
I think we both live with him	Puto nos utrumque vivere cum illo
I'm sure I'll never want to hear from you again.	Pro certo habeo te numquam iterum audire velle.
But she refused to think.	Sed illa cogitare noluit.
I just want to be with you	EGO iustus volo ut sit me et te
And he knew that it was well.	Et sciebat quod bene esset.
I need your help with tonight	Opus auxilium tuum cum hac nocte
We can say.	Dicere possumus.
I have been all day	Totum diem fui
I did this on my own	Hoc feci in mea
I don't know what it is.	Nescio quid sit.
And this is the same.	Et hoc ipsum est.
He was sure.	Certus erat.
You can trust us all.	Omnes nos potes credere.
If there was any	Si quis erat.
I knew like a book.	Sciebam sicut librum.
I didn't know what was going to happen	Ego nesciebam quid futurum esset
I believe in you only	Credo in te tantum
I know that	Ego scio quod
He knew what his job was.	Sciebat quid suum officium esset.
I did whatever you want.	Feci quod vis.
It's not much.	Non multum est.
I've been for quite some time now	Fui satis aliquo tempore iam
He knows this.	Scit hoc.
What do you want to do this way	Quid vis ut faciam hoc modo
I have friends there	Habeo amicos ibi
And so he did.	Et sic fecit.
i know i love her	Scio te amo eam

It's fine for me.	Bene mihi hoc.
I knew what was going to happen	Sciebam quod futurum erat
Don't stop anything.	Noli quicquam prohibere.
I know that I have done it.	Scio me fecisse.
I could not see him.	Eum videre non potui.
I saw the look he gave to you	Vidi vultus dedit tibi
It was certain.	Certum erat.
Which would be true.	Quod verum esset.
I did not know.	Ego nesciebam.
Only the first floor	Tantum primum solum
You can even make a great meal.	Vel magna prandium facere potes.
I want to talk about that	Volo loqui quod
That's what he was doing.	Id erat facere.
I am not doing well.	Non bene facio.
I could not stop.	Non potui prohibere.
He did not see me.	Me non vidit.

i am really good	Ego vere bonum est
I can think of you too	Non possum cogitas te quoque
Your future.	Tuum futurum.
I told him not to be bad	Dixi eum non esse malum
I want to work	Volo ad opus
It's not like it used to be.	Hoc non est simile esse solebat.
I can't say if there is anything in it	Non possum dicere si est aliquid in eo
I didn't know anything about it	Ego nesciebam quid de illo
They are almost all present.	Omnes fere nunc sunt.
I can't tell anyone about this	Non possum dicere quis de hoc
I want to know more about it	Volo scire de eo
I wonder a little about this.	De hoc parum miror.
But this is not so.	Non tamen hoc ita est.
That is not necessary.	Quod non est necesse.
I've never met you	Nunquam enim occurrit vobis
I want your help.	Auxilium tuum volo.
No one told me.	Nemo non indicavit mihi.
Never let him down.	Numquam eum.
It does not please.	Non placet.
I don't know what to think or do	Nescio quid cogitare vel facere
Maybe he had.	Fortasse habuit.
There was something new.	Non fuit aliquid novi.
That was what it was.	Id factum esse quod erat.
I don't need to see it again.	Non opus est videre illud.
I know where this is going	Scio ubi hoc eat
I am the same to her	Idem sum ad eam
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
He was here today.	Hic erat hodie.
I have something better to do.	Habeo aliquid melius facere.
I am not alone in this	non sum solus in hoc
It's already enough.	Iam satis est.
Certainly not getting what you wanted.	Certe non questus quod voluit.
But still he was not.	Sed adhuc non erat.
These things I wanted to say	Haec volui dicere
But this is still much better.	Sed hoc multum adhuc melius est.
It's his achievement, not mine.	Est eius factum, non mea.
I see how she looks at you	Video quomodo illa spectat ad vos
I will do this again.	adhuc hoc faciam.
Is it not time to do something about this?	Nonne tempus est aliquid de hoc ?
I couldn't talk to him anymore	Non potui loqui ei amplius
I don't want to be without you	Non vis ut sine te
Which is perhaps difficult.	Quod fortasse difficile est.
I've never heard anything like that	Ego numquam audivi aliquid simile quod
He told me to give you time.	Dixit mihi dare tibi tempus.
I wanted nothing else but to get you from him	nihil aliud volui quam ut te ab illo
i know her very well.	eam optime novi.
I could do this	Hoc facere potui
Who I could hear	Quis non potui audire
You can barely see.	Vix videre potes.
You always know	Semper tu scis
I didn't want to say.	Non volui dicere.
That was so.	Sic erat id.
It was not good.	Non erat bonum.
I will do everything for me.	Omnia mihi faciam.

So it is.	Ita est.
Is that what you want?	Estne id quod vis?.

For he was.	Erat enim.
got me.	Obtinuit me.
I don't like to get advice	Non sum similis ut consilium
I've been very busy	Ego valde occupatus fui

I knew it would be good to come here	Sciebam hic venire bonum esset
I wonder what else she knows	Miror quid aliud illa scit
There will be.	Ibi erit.
I hope all is well	Spero omnia bene
He did not know.	Nesciebat.
I didn't know this could even be done	Nesciebam hoc etiam fieri posse

I didn't want to tell you, but there it is.	Nolui tibi dicere, sed ibi est.
I told him what happened to you	Dixi ei quod factum est ad vos
I can barely see.	Vix videre possum.
I told someone about it	Dixi aliquem de eo
Or there is something from you.	Vel sit aliquid ex te.
There is always time for you	Semper tempus vobis
But that's out now.	Sed id nunc ex.
He could not be my dog.	Canis meus esse non potuit.
He can't talk to us.	Non potest nobis dicere.
We have  .	Habemus .
I see nothing wrong with what you want to do.	Nihil mali in eo quod vis facere video.
I knew you would accept	Sciebam te accipere

I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
Don't act	Non agere
It makes it hard to believe anyone.	Facit difficile credere quis.
That's what he was doing.	Id se facere.
Wanted to guess more from him	Voluit suspicor plus ex eo
I don't know his name.	Nescio nomen eius.
You don't want him to see me like this	Non vis eum ad me sic
I just need to do	Ego iustus opus fac
I told her we	Dixi ei nos eam
I never did	Nunquam feci
Yes, he is here.	Etiam hic est.
I knew he was just out of school	Sciebam erat iustus e schola
He is not here.	Non est hic.
I'm done with him.	Ego feci cum eo.
But someone does the job.	Sed aliquis officium facit.
I can't help looking for it	Ego potest auxilium vultus eius
He said nothing.	Nihil dixit.
I knew you were here	Sciebam te hic esse
I am sure his dad has a lot to do with it.	Pater eius certus sum multum facere cum illo.
Do the same thing	Idem facit
Not always, but often.	Non semper, sed saepe.
There was none in none.	Nulla in nulla erat.

That's what.	Id quod.
Don't talk.	Non loqui.

i thought we would have a house, you and me	Putabam nos habere domum, tu et me
I have always been there for everything	Ego sum omnia ibi semper fuit
I didn't want to talk to him	Nolui dicere ei
Don't say anything else	Non dicam aliud
I think you know respect for me	Puto te scire quantum ad me
I wanted to do that to you	Ego volui facere quod tibi
I just made it where it was made	Ego iustus factum est in quo factum est
I didn't know what it was	Ego nesciebam quid esset
I don't care anymore	Nolo amplius
I go through it all	Me ire per omnes
I need someone to do something	Mihi opus est ad rem aliquem

Yes that's none other than that.	Etiam id quam nulla.
That would be very true and true.	Quod multum esset verum et verum.
I am surprised to see you	Miror te videre
for he could never tell him what he thought was done.	numquam enim id ei narrare posse, quod factum putabat.
This was true.	Hoc verum erat.
I want to see exactly that.	Prorsus ut me vis videre.
I am great out there	Ego magna ex ibi

I wanted something else and perhaps better	Volui aliquid aliud et fortasse melius
How	Quam.
I can be hard to live	Non possum esse difficile ad vivere
I thought too	Putavi etiam
long enough I'm with you	Satis diu sum tecum
He knows what to do.	Ille scit quid sibi faciendum sit.

Anger! 	Ire!
more if you want.	plus est, si vis.
I knew what it was	Sciebam quid esset

I have to deal with what is true	Habeo agere quod est verum

For truly.	Vere enim.
I still have friends there.	Ego tamen ibi amicos habeo.
I am only trying to help you	Ego sum solus conatur ad auxilium te
That's his name.	Id est nomen eius.
Not one only, but both.	Non unum solum, sed utrumque.
he himself said.	ipse dixit.
Maybe that's the same thing.	Aliquam id ipsum ipsum.
I have to believe that	Habeo credere quod
Really wanted.	Vere voluit.
That said, it is getting better.	Hoc dixit, melius est questus.
So, really, really good.	Ut, vere, vere bonum.

You'll never do that.	Numquam id facere.
Breakfast is really good.	Prandium est vere bonum.
Now I want to be there	Nunc volo ibi esse

I couldn't think of anything to do with you.	Quod de te facere non potui cogitare.
He had nothing to say to him.	Nihil habuit ei dicere.
we did not see.	nos non vidit.
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
If I told you	Dixi vobis, si
Good and bad.	Bonum et malum.
And rightly indeed.	Et recte quidem.
I wanted him to appreciate it badly	Ego voluit eum ut bene sit male
yes there is no time	Etiam tempus nulla est.
don't want to hear it anymore	Non vis audire eam amplius
I don't want to find out.	Non vis invenire.
I need it.	Mihi opus est.
Thus it was done.	Sic factum est.
You don't need me.	Non opus est mihi.
I know everything there to know about him	Scio omnia ibi scire de eo
I can hardly be here	Vix possum hic
Not long.	Non diu.
That was in me.	Quod erat in me.
But at least it was time	Sed certe tempus erat
Maybe that's always the case.	Aliquam id semper est.
It is not so with us.	Non ita est nobiscum.
I want to help you through this	Volo tibi per hoc
I was not sick one day	Non eram male dies unus
There is someone who wants something.	Est qui velit aliquid.
Which indeed is not true.	Quod quidem verum non est.
I was here to hear	Hic eram audire
I was still the same	Adhuc idem essem
I know I'm coming	Scio me venire sunt
I am still alive.	adhuc sum.
I knew even this would not be good	Sciebam etiam hoc non esse bonum
I like to do it	Ego amo ut faciam illud
And this was done by both.	Et hoc per utrumque factum est.
what's the best way to do it?.	Quid optime facere ?.
seems to have been	fuisse videtur
I don't know what I completely forgot about this	Ego nescio quid omnino oblitus de hoc
I think we are late now	Puto nos nuper nunc sumus
I said that this is very lonely	Dixi quod hoc est valde solum
Maybe it was what he wanted.	Aliquam quis velit erat.
But that's not right.	Sed id non recte.
But not even now.	Sed nec nunc.
I never heard this before.	Numquam ante hoc audivi.
I don't think this	Non mihi videtur hoc
For he knew.	Sciebat enim.
I want some time alone with you	Volo aliquo tempore solum apud te
That's too easy.	Nimis id facile.
Something has to give.	Aliquid habet dare.
He is the man who looks at him.	Ipse homo est qui illum spectat.
Nothing else I thought	Nihil aliud cogitavi
I don't feel anything else	Non sentio aliud
I will some time	Ego autem aliquo tempore
I can't talk about it	Non possum dicere de illo
We need something else.	Aliud nobis opus est.
I have one for me	Habeo unum pro me
That is not the case now.	Quod iam non est.
I thought about going for it but you know	Cogitavi de ire pro, sed tu scis
I don't know who	Ego non scio quis
Now help yourself.	Nunc te adiuvet.
There will be a problem	Non erit quaestio
He said he didn't want one.	Noluit unum dixit.
But now he does not.	Sed iam non facit.
I want you to be with me	Volo te esse mecum
I meant to say something	Dicere volui, aliquid
as required.	Quod erat faciendum.
I just didn't know how to say	Ego iustus nesciebam quam dicere
It is not so.	Non ita est.
It's in everything.	Est in omnibus.
He didn't say anything.	Non dixit aliquid.
If yes it is true.	Quod si etiam verum est.
I can't speak well enough.	Non possum satis bene dicere.
It probably was.	Probabile esset.
You did not do your job.	Tuum officium non fecisti.
It is not for us at this time.	Non est nobis hoc tempore.
I want you to be able to believe	Volo te posse credere
Yes they are.	Ita sunt.
How hard it was now	Quam difficile nunc esset .
It is certain.	Certus eft.
I believe	Credo .
I'll do this when you're next time.	Hoc faciam, cum proximo tempore es.
He never wants to talk to me again.	Iterum me loqui numquam vult.
Unless you believe in yourself.	Nisi in ipsum.
But there is another.	Est autem aliud.
I will speak again.	Iterum dicam.
She could have some better time.	Posset aliquid melius habere tempus.
But that was what it was.	Sed id erat erat.
I think you just talk to him	Puto te solum ad eum loqui
I was not the only one	Non eram solus unus
I think that's pretty good	Puto quod satis est bonum
I can almost see that one	Non possum fere videre quod unum
I just don't have to deal with it now	Modo non agere cum eo nunc
i love her very much.	eam valde amo.
I never thought that way	Numquam cogitavi illuc
I hope not too much	Spero non nimis
That's before.	Id ante.
I think I had fun.	Puto me amet fuisse.
It is necessary for you.	Necesse est tibi.
I can't tell you here	Non possum dicere te hic
I'm another one	Ego se unum
Maybe she'll talk to you again.	Dixit iterum tibi loqui fortasse.
Maybe that is.	Fortasse id est.
I will make it easy for you	Facile faciam tibi
I really think he meant what he said	Ego vere cogitare intellexit quod dixit
I know what I can do	Scio quid possit facere
Maybe not so easy, though.	Fortasse non tam facile, sed.
Or at least, it is not yet.	Vel certe, nondum est.
You really should.	Vere debet.
Before and after	A ante, et post
I really thought it would stay	Ego vere putavit eam manere
I didn't say to him, you can't do that here	Non ei dixi, non potes facere ut hic
If we	Si nos.
He was alone there for me.	Solus ibi erat mihi.
Something to do, perhaps	Aliquid ei faciam, fortasse
Or, you can see.	Vel, videre potes.
I knew what it was up to	Sciebam quid esset usque ad
But my name was not me.	Sed nomen meum non erat me.
Even not before him.	Etiam nec ipsum ante.
I know what's good for me	Scio quid sit bonum mihi
which I am still doing.	quod adhuc facio.
I'm glad I'm going to work	Gaudeo me ire ad opus
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
But no one can see the future.	Nemo tamen futurum videre potest.
I know, and you know.	Scio, et scis.
We're not sure why.	Quod certe non sumus.
No one knows anything.	Nemo aliquid scit.
I know him well.	Novi eum bene.
I heard about you.	Audivi de te.
It was a good decision for me.	Bonum mihi consilium fuit.
This was not the first time.	Nec hoc primum.
And there is one.	Et unum est.
But neither was there any.	Sed nec aliquam erat.
I hope all is good	Spero omnia bona
It's morning time.	Est mane dies.
I know what you're like	Scio quid simile es
I already have dinner	Ego iam cenam
I didn't know they were friends	Ego nesciebam se amicos esse
I can't talk about it now	Non possum dicere de hoc nunc
Never be ready	Numquam paratus est
I haven't heard that	Non audivi quod
Completely different.	Aliud omnino.
not much something this morning	Non multum aliquid hoc mane
I see you for it	Ego te ad illum
He himself is evil.	Se ipsum, malum.
You do what you have with me.	Facis quod mecum habes.
now I know that he wants this for me	nunc scio se hoc mihi velle
and he did not say, he said.	et non dixit, dixit.
This is different.	Hoc aliud est.
I probably don't need you	Ego probabiliter non opus est tibi
Can't find it.	Non potest eam invenire.
I knew you weren't going to be here for a long time	Sciebam te non diu hic futurum esse
I wonder why she knows	Miror cur haec illa scit
That was done.	Quod factum erat.
Well much better.	Multo melius bene.
I haven't done anything wrong here	Non quicquam mali feci hic
I'm not sure exactly what's going to happen.	Quid futurum sit prorsus non sum certus.
I need to go after him	Mihi opus est ire post eum
I'm coming to you	Me venire ad te
I like this category	Ego ut genus hoc
I really like it here	Ego vere placet hic
but what was done.	sed quid factum est.
I don't want to go to school	Non vis ad scholam
I mean what you want.	Ut sit id quod vis.
He told me what I needed.	Dixit mihi quid opus esset.
I haven't seen him	Non vidi eum
If he does.	Si agit.
He was still here.	Hic tamen erat.
There was nothing wrong with that year that year.	Nihil mali de illo anno illo anno fuit.
What could have been done.	Quod fieri potuit.
I know exactly what happened	Scio prorsus quid factum est
He did nothing to me.	Nihil mihi fecit.
I will stay with her here	Ego hic mane apud eam
Look to me.	Vide ut me.
He wanted to do something.	Aliquid facere voluit.
And he says no.	Et dicit nulla.
It's great to be here.	Magna est hic esse.
I know you know how it is	scio te scire quomodo sit
Yes, only.	Ita, tantum.
I wish it wasn't	Volo hoc non fuit
I barely feel it	Vix sentio
I don't know, man.	Nescio, homo.
I don't think it does	Non puto hoc facit
This is not very well.	Hoc non nimis bene.
Everybody's? 	Omnibus est?
I know him and his work is better than someone else	Scio eum et opus eius melius quam aliquis
So that's the thing.	Ita ut res est.
It is very good for you.	Bonum est tibi valde.
I heard what he said first	Audivi quid dixit primum
We can.	Possumus.
You're like me.	Tu similis es mihi.
I have something that is important	Habeo aliquid quod sit amet
In this way he said that he could not do it.	Hoc modo dixit se facere non posse.
He said.	Dixit.
I knew what I could do	Sciebam quid facere posset
He doesn't want to do that	Non vult facere quod
I have to talk to him	Habeo loqui ei
We'll be there	Non te ibi
There will be.	Ibi erit.
I want to live in one of you	Volo vivere in se ex vobis
I've done the job myself	Ego feci officium me
i don't know what to do	nescio quid facere
I wonder even if this is possible	Miror etiam si id fieri potest
I didn't know how it was going to be.	Nesciebam quomodo futurum esset.
It was very important to us.	Amet erat nobis ipsum.
He could not see any thing either.	Aliquem rem vel videre non potuit.
I don't know how to help her.	Nescio quomodo eam adiuvet.
I don't know why that's.	Nescio cur id.
That's what I wanted to do.	Id mea facere velit.
Thus we are.	Sic sumus.
From him I could not	Ab eo non potui
I just want to know what happened to him	EGO iustus volo scire quid factum est ei
What appears to have been done here.	Quod hic factum esse videtur.
don't do it anymore	Non faciam amplius
Totally in you after me	Prorsus in te post me
It's fine for me.	Bene est mihi.
A good man, as he said	Vir bonus, ut dixit
Don't like me.	Non amo me.
I don't have a job	Ego non habeo officium
It does not please.	Non placet.
when that time rather than when.	Cum id tempus quam cum.
I do not believe.	non credo.
you are my everything.	meus es tu omnia.
His father	Pater eius.
I am in this category	Ego sum in hoc genus
We need it.	Opus est nobis.
he had work.	opus habuit.
sorry for that too	Paenitet me quod etiam
I have not seen anything live.	Non vidi quicquam vivere.
I was always happy	Fui semper felix
I couldn't help you	Non potui vobis
I owe him more than	Debere ei plus quam
That's probably enough for now.	Id nunc satis probabiliter est.
I didn't know it was necessary.	Nesciebam ut opus esset.
It's not what you think.	Non est quod tibi videtur.
You don't want to be that man	Non vis esse quod homo
Now he was still alive.	Nunc adhuc erat.
I didn't know something like that would happen	Ego nesciebam aliquid simile quod futurum est
I am pretty sure no one knew much about it	Ego satis certo nemo scivit multa de eo
Or that's how it was.	Vel erat id quam.
What he did and what he could not do.	Quid faceret et quid non posset facere.
This is something new.	Hoc est aliquid novi.
But perhaps it was.	Sed fortasse erat.
I just saw it about a week ago	Ego iustus vidi eum de septimana ante
I could not believe that	Non potui credere quod
Something more.	Plus aliquid.
You're only on time.	Tu modo in tempore.
It was scarcely possible.	Vix erat.
They're fun people.	Sunt amet homines.
Nothing like that.	Quicquam ut.
It is the same with us today.	Simile est apud nos hodie;
He would not listen.	Noluit audire.
So much effort is good for him	Tantum conatus sit bonum eius
If you could do it I could help you	Si vis facere potui adiuvare vos
Look at it, it's hard to do.	Vide is, difficile est facere.
I just knew it was fun	Ego iustus scivi erat amet
I can do better than	Non possum facere melius quam
We don't have this to convince you.	Non habemus hoc tibi persuadere.
I wonder why you are here	Miror cur hic
I'm sorry	Dixi iam me paenitet
I need to stay here a little longer	Mihi opus est hic manere paulo diutius
I have to go to work.	Ire ad opus habeo.
It's time to do something.	Aliquam nec aliquam est.
I never asked where	Numquam quaesivit ubi
I knew what it really was	Sciebam quid hoc vere esset
This is the man.	Hoc est homo.
No one wants that.	Nulla quis velit quam.
I don't want to hear	Non vis audire
Well that's what I was doing.	Bene id facerem.
This has not always been.	Hoc non semper fuit.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
I owe me a lot	Mihi multum debeo
I really didn't want to go	Ego vere noluit ire
And you're out there with yourself.	Et te ex nulla cum ipsum.
I need to talk to someone.	Opus est loqui ad aliquem.
I really think it's sorry	Ego vere cogitare suus 'Paenitet
I am a pretty good teacher.	Sum satis bonus magister.
But I don't like it much.	Sed non multum nobis placet.
I never wanted him to stop	Numquam volui illum prohibere
I was not here at all, indeed	Hic omnino non essem, vere
That's none of it for us.	Id nulla id ipsum nobis.
I always wanted to go there and did it	Ego semper volui illuc ire et sic fecit
I didn't know what was wrong	nesciebam quid mali esset
Don't do anything at all	Ne quid omnino
I think I love you	Puto te amo
He says it's better to go now.	Dicit melius nunc ire.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
But as he was he was.	Sed ut erat erat.
That was not said.	Ut non dictum erat.
Truly, truly.	Vere, vere.
I didn't know what	Ego nesciebam quid
I don't see you there	Non video te ibi
It's never enough.	Numquam satis est.
He told me the future.	Dixit mihi futurum.
I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.	Scio difficile credere, sed verum est.
I'm sorry for that decision right now	Paenitet me quod nunc consilium
i thought you were.	Putabam te esse.
But there is a lot to be said for that.	Sed sit amet dictum quam.
It never even happened	Numquam etiam factum est
I was unable to find much information about him.	Multum de eo invenire non potui.
I wanted to stay	Volui ut manere
I couldn't do that to him	Non potui facere quod ei
I don't know, maybe most of the time.	Nescio, forte plus temporis.
This is not ready	Hoc non paratus
I was not ready for it	Non eram paratus ad eam
You and me.	Tu et me.
I need to live	Mihi opus est mihi vivere
I know you can understand	Scio te posse intelligere
I have seen it, but I have seen nothing	vidi sic, sed nihil vidi
This he knows.	Hoc scit.
That's it, very well.	Id ipsum, optime.
I thought I would be	Putavi fore
I forgot all about it	Oblitus sum omnes de eo
I don't even have a job	Non quidem habere officium
You mean it.	Vis eam.
I forgot how well he knows me	Oblitus sum quam bene novit me
A good man, but could not swim	Vir bonus, sed natare non potuit
how truly	quam vere.
There is no great saying in it.	Nulla in dictum magna.
I hope all is well.	Spero omnes bene.
He had not yet thought.	Nondum putabat.
I wasn't really sure	Ego vere certus non essem
That is nothing.	Quod nihil est.
' I	' EGO !.
I don't know where	Nescio quo
I didn't think it would be but it really is	Non putavi fore sed vere est
I haven't seen	Non vidi
I have more to say to you	Plus habeo tibi dicere
Yes it is for me sure.	Ita est in me certus.
I am just a little happy	Ego iustus paulo felix
And there is a problem.	Et est quaestio.
Or not.	Vel non.
I knew exactly what would happen	Sciebam prorsus quid futurum sit
I think it would be so.	Puto fore ut.
When he speaks, he always speaks thus.	Cum loquitur, semper sic loquitur.
I should probably get there soon	Ut probabiliter mox illuc usque
I'm really kind of bad	Sum vere genus malum
want, want, want	volo, vis, vis
We can do it.	Possumus facere id.
I could not understand	Non potui intelligere
Something to do about it	Aliquid faciendum de illo
Now, it is too late.	Iam sero est.
As much as possible.	Quantum potest.
I wanted to know it	Scire volui eam
I hope one day I can do it with everyone.	Spero unum diem id facere posse cum omnibus.
Nothing else.	Nihil aliud.
Not much, but at home.	Non multum, sed domi est.
I just want to think	Ego iustus volo cogitare
If I want me	Volo, si me
I have nothing to say	Non habeo tibi dicere
I can't do you one good	Non possum facere tibi unum bonum
And you know we need it.	Scis autem nobis opus esse.
I hope we can stay friends	Spero nos posse manere amicos
I think enough has been done today	Satis puto esse factum est hodie
It was not easy for him to do this.	Hoc facile in se facturum non erat.
I told him so much after class.	ei tam post genus dixi.
The time has not come.	Non hoc tempore venit.
I will definitely leave you all this year.	Certus sum vobis hoc anno omnia relinquere.
This is the only thing I know you need to do	Hoc solum scio debes facere
And in your family too.	Et in tua quoque.
It was a great time.	Magna erat tempus.
I couldn't believe this really happened	Hoc vere fieri non potui credere
I am sure you live by this	Certus sum te ex hoc vivere
But we have a job to do.	Sed habemus officium facere.
I know all these things	Ego novi ad omnia haec
I could well hear it	Non potui bene audire eam
In this way, in this way.	Hoc modo, hoc modo.
But you need to know the truth.	Sed debes scire verum.
I really like to discuss you	Ego vere amo ut de te
I knew what happened	Sciebam quod factum est
I was the last one to see you yesterday night	Ego tandem unum videre heri nocte
Maybe okay, but not this time.	Forsitan bene, sed non hoc tempore.
I know you know this quickly	Hoc scio cito te scire
I heard about it this morning	Audivi de hoc mane
It's not a bad deal.	Nec male multum est.
He loves you.	Hoc amat tibi.
There was none as none.	Nulla ut nulla erat.
I had, to have.	Habui, habere.
I like this too.	Placet hoc quoque.
I have heard you.	Audivi te.
I need me and be	Mihi opus est mihi et esse
don't stop this time	Non prohibere hoc tempore
There's something more.	Ibi plus aliquid est.
I have a lot to go on yet	Ego multum adhuc ire
I have to tell us e	Habeo ad nos e
I have more than one wish	Habeo plus quam unum velle
More than likely both.	Plus quam probabile utrumque.
Tell me something new you know.	Dic te aliquid novi scire.
That's pretty much the same thing.	Id ipsum fere.
But even some save.	Sed vel aliquam nisi.
To be yourself is something to yourself.	Ipsum sit aliquid ipsum ad.
I believe this correctly.	Recte hoc credo.
This is got everything.	Hoc est, omnia obtinuit.
If it's a day you can't say it.	Si suus 'diem' non potes dicere.
I know what you are thinking	Scio quid cogitas
This was not the plan.	Hoc consilium non fuit.
We need to win.	Vincere nobis opus est.
I don't really need to listen	Non vere opus est audire
I think it is someone	Puto esse aliquis
The Office.	Officium.
Maybe it was and it was.	Aliquam et erat erat.
It's bad, you know.	Malum est, scis.
I didn't even think about it.	Ne id quidem putavi.
I hope it's done	Spero quod factum est
Maybe he didn't see it at all.	Fortasse omnino non vidit.
Again it was done.	Iterum factum est.
It was thought.	Esse putavit.
There is no one before that.	Nulla quis ante quam.
I could not do this again	Hoc iterum non potui
I can see through you	Per te videre possum
I could see one behind him	Unum post se videre potui

We have nothing for sure.	Pro certo habemus nihil.

This season is something else.	Hoc tempore aliquid aliud est.
I have something to say to you.	Habeo tibi aliquid dicere.
That's going to be true.	Quod verum futurum est.

There is no way to save yourself.	Nulla ut nisi ipsum.
But he did nothing.	Nihil tamen fecit.
I can't believe that	Non possum credere quod
I'm just glad to be done	Ego iustus gaudeo fieri
I can't say what you think	Non possum dicere quid cogitat
But it is a name.	Sed nomen est.
I love her more than anything	Eam amo quam aliquid
I never had to go.	Numquam cum ut.
Maybe nothing is more important than that.	Aliquam quam nihil est.
I saw what yours is like	Vidi quod tuum est similis

He did not want this to be done.	Noluit hoc fieri.
And it was his.	Erat autem eius.

This ought to be done.	Hoc fieri debet.
I just had nothing to do with it.	Modo nihil ad rem.
I need your help	Ut opus auxilium tuum

I told him it would be in the afternoon	Dixi ei fore per meridiem
Nothing is gonna be any more than that.	Nulla sit amet aliquam quam.
I think it is something else	Puto esse aliquid aliud
But it probably won't.	Sed verisimile non erit.

We need it now.	Nunc opus est nobis.
I've done my job.	Ego feci officium meum.

But as stated above.	Sed ut dictum est.
I believe.	credo.
He could do this, he said to himself.	Hoc facere posset, dixit sibi.

I was barely in time.	vix in tempore fui.
I'm always sorry to do this.	Hoc me semper facere paenitet.

This work resolved	Hoc opus certus
It's not time	Non est in tempore
I think you've finally done it	Puto te tandem factum est

He asked for my name.	Nomen quaesivit meum.
I had all things to myself.	omnia ad me habui.

But who is still alive?	Sed adhuc quis.
This question seems to be the question here.	Quaestio haec quaestio hic esse videtur.
Yes it is possible.	Ita fieri potest.
I didn't want you to be like this.	Nolui te sic esse.
He said not much about him.	Non multa de eo dixit.
It was the same story.	Aliquam id ipsum erat.
he came hither to be seen here.	huc venit ut hic videri posset.
I hope you all had	Spero vos omnes habuit

I have always said this.	Semper id dictum.
It really got me.	Is mihi vere obtinuit.

That was the same thing.	Id ipsum erat.
I didn't one day	Non feci unum diem
This was enough.	Hoc satis fuit.

I really like him	Ego vere similis ei

But he could not find it.	Sed invenire non potuit.
Not us.	Non nobis.
I want to see what it looks like	Volo videre quid is vultus amo

could not have.	habere non potuit.
But something else.	Sed aliquid aliud.
I didn't tell her this time	Non dixi ei hoc tempore
I just knew I was there	Ego iustus scivi non esset ibi
That's absolutely correct.	Quod omnino recte.
I don't know enough to say how you think.	Nescio quomodo satis dicere cogitas.
That's the same thing.	Id idem.
I need to see him again	Mihi opus est ad eum iterum
I can't love someone	Non possum me ad aliquem amet
He does nothing.	Ille nihil agit.
Maybe this will be correct.	Forsitan hoc recte erit.
Now he knew it was not going to happen.	Nunc sciebat id non esse futurum.
I really didn't want anyone to see me like this	Ego vere nolebat quis ad me sic
I never want to stop looking at him	Numquam vis prohibere vultus in eo
If you don't have it, you don't have it.	Si non habes, non habes.
It is certainly never forgotten.	Ita certe oblitus est numquam.
Yes you are right.	Etiam tu recte.
I wonder why.	Miror quid.
I don't want to feel it again	Non vis ut sentio iterum
I can't do this work	Hoc opus facere non possum
There was no need to do it.	Nihil opus erat facere.
I wonder how much time has passed	Miror quantum temporis iam
You have done this to us.	Hoc fecisti nobis.
A lot of time	Multum temporis est
This is not to say that all do not know.	Hoc non est dicere omnes nescire.
That she did.	Id fecit.
I'm glad to have you.	Gaudeo te habere.
I have one question.	Habeo unum quaestionem.
I think this boy will be good to you	Puto hic puer bene tibi erit

He said I don't want to tell you.	Nolo dixit tibi dicere.
You should be at home!'	Domi debes!'.
It is not his.	Non eius.
I know both.	utrumque novi.
This is not quite true.	Hoc non est satis verum.
Why? 	Quare?
I really wonder how true it is.	Vere miror quam verum sit.
This made me think otherwise.	Hoc me fecit aliud cogitare.
There is no longer there	Ibi iam non sit
I can be like that	Ego potest esse sicut quod
No need to go	Non opus est ire
I'm not here to do it.	Hic ego non faciam.
I didn't know what this meant	Ego nesciebam quid hoc esset
This is.	Hic est.
But that's not the problem.	Sed id non est quaestio.
I really shouldn't say	Ego vere dicere non debet
We have to do it.	Facere habemus id.
I think through friends.	Puto per amicos.
You did a very good job.	Optime fecisti officium.
I think that's her name	Puto quod nomen eius
No matter, it was good.	Nulla res, bona erat.
I hope that's up to him	Spero autem quod est ad eum
I didn't know what was behind it	Ego nesciebam quid esset post illud
I knew something there	Sciebam quid ibi
I need to know if he's still here	Mihi opus est scire, si adhuc hic est
He wanted to go too.	Ire quoque vellet.
Almost no one has.	Nemo fere habet.
In.	In.
I haven't seen you in a long time	Non vidi te diu
He cannot live like this.	Sic vivere non potest.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
I just need to	Ego iustus opus ad
That's great.	Ut magna.
But I never really know.	Sed numquam vere scio.
It was not working at the time.	Non opus erat tempore.
I think that's what he did.	Id fecisse puto.
I like everything about him	Mihi placet omnia de eo
Just for the day.	Modo ad diem.
It looks good to me.	Bonum mihi videtur.
For him	Pro eo
I know you are good	Scio te bonum esse
I think I should be	Puto me esse
I don't want you now.	Nolo te modo.
Nothing was going to happen.	Nihil futurum erat.
I wish this would not be	Utinam hoc non esset
The whole plan.	Totum consilium.
Work is what needs to be done.	Opus est quod fieri debet.
How you want everything.	Quam vis omnia.
I didn't know what was wrong	Ego nesciebam quid esset malum
not an email.	Non quis.
Okay, so it seems.	Bene, ut videtur.
Who knew how long.	Quis quam diu scivit.
You'll never see her live again	Numquam videre eam vivere iterum
More than you know.	Plus quam scis.
Better ask him.	Melius eum a.
But it was no longer of me.	Sed iam non erat de me.
I can't say that now	Non possum dicere quod nunc
It's probably hard.	Probabiliter difficile est.
I don't know where I got it	Nescio ubi obtinuit eum
I thought of one thing	Cogitavi unum
I don't like him.	Non sicut eum.
But this was not done.	Sed hoc non est factum.
I can't really think	Non possum vere cogitare
I never saw a time when I was not	Numquam vidi tempus quando non erat
I am all alone	Omnia sum solus
Time is getting to me.	Tempus est questus ad me.
I know what you mean	Scio quid vis
Just knew where to see	Sicut scivi ubi vide
I could not be seen	Videri non potui
but you know.	sed scis.
And do it again.	Et fac illud iterum.
I just didn't want to act too much	Modo nolebat agere nimis
don't do it anymore	Non faciam amplius
Don't give me up.	Noli me dare.
I'd like to see some one	Libet videre aliquid unum
It's not much.	Non multum est.
And yet nothing is better.	Et adhuc nihil melius.
He doesn't want to do that.	Quod facere non vult.
I like to just think about myself with my mom	Ego similis solum cogitare de me apud meum
Tomorrow I don't know	Cras nescio
I could see what it was	Videre potui quid esset
He saw also.	Vidit etiam.
I was like a young boy	Sicut puer puer fui
I could see the best	Non potui videre optime
I really think he is	Ego vere cogitare est ille
Really really sick.	Vere vere male.
I can't see it very well now	Non possum videre illud optime nunc
But I never did it to him.	Sed numquam id ei.
I also go to dinner	Ego etiam ad cenam
I want to give you what you want	Volo tibi dare quod vis
I knew.	Sciebam.
Okay? 	Bene?
But that's enough for him.	Sed ei quod satis est.
I wanted to help now	Adiuvare nunc volui
by car.	Currus a.
i never knew what it was.	numquam scivi quid esset.
It was done too quickly.	Nimis cito factum est.
I strongly believe that	Valde credo quod
Which is not so.	Quod non ita est.
It is not so for us.	Non ita est nobis.
He does not know what it is.	Nescit quid sit.
If it is true.	Si verum est.
Certainly, if it was, he did not.	Certe, si fuit, non fecit.
I couldn't be too late	Non potui, nimium sero
We can still see.	Adhuc videre possumus.
When I saw myself	Vidi, cum ipse mihi
I wonder if you can help me	Miror si me adiuvet
I hope a good one	Spero bonum unum
It was him.	Erat eum.
I know you can do the job	Scio te officium facere potes
When you don't want it, don't.	Cum non vis, noli.
Today was not resolved anymore.	Hodie non iam certus erat.
But there are things that I don't like.	Sed sunt quae non ut.
Well, nothing.	Bene, nihil est.
Yes, we can.	Vere, possumus.
I want to know someone	Volo scire aliquem
I need her here.	Hic mihi opus est suo.
But this is not an easy journey.	Sed hoc non facile iter.
I thought about it tonight.	Cogitavi de eo hac nocte.
I can help you a lot	Non possum tibi multum
Or perhaps he is still alive.	Vel fortasse adhuc est.
Maybe not at all.	Fortasse non omnia.
That doesn't mean you have to do something.	Quod non sit tibi aliquid.
i think that for you	Puto quod per te
You need to know what he means.	Scire debes quid sibi velit.
I knew he needed help	Sciebam ei opus auxilium
I have nothing to do today	Habeo nihil facere hodie
I only wanted to help him	Tantum voluit ut sibi auxilium
Not yet a boy.	Nec tamen puer.
After this I wanted to say something, say something	Post hanc volui dicere aliquid, aliquid
In no time.	In et tempus nulla.
I could not say who it was	Non potui dicere quis esset
What he did.	Quod fecit.
Leave me everything you need.	Mihi omnia relinquere debes.
What to do with.	Quae cum ad.
When you are not, there is none.	Cum non es, non est ibi.
You really need it.	Vere opus est.
I don't know whether this is or not.	Nescio an hoc sit nec non.
I know you understand that much	Scio te intelligere quod multum
I didn't know what it could be	Nesciebam quid posset esse
I want the truth e	Volo verum e
That's what he wants.	Id velit.
I need to say it first	Mihi opus est dicere primum
I told him about you	Dixi ei de te
I'm pretty good	Ego satis bonum est
I don't need anything	Non opus est aliquid
when done correctly.	Cum bene factum est.
I can't go through it	Non possum ire per illud
For a long time.	Multo tempore.
Not him indeed.	Non illum quidem.
I can't even think of anything to say	Non possum quidem cogitare aliquid dicere
But this does not appear.	Sed hoc non videtur.
This could not be done	Hoc fieri non potui
I've been here tonight	Fui hic nocte
I want to hear about this	Volo audire de hoc
Got to have more.	Obtinuit plus habere.
He's been here for a long time.	Hic diu fuit.
I really appreciate your help	Ego vere bene auxilium tuum
Whether it is possible or not.	An potest vel non.
never asked about him again	Numquam quaesivit de se iterum
So glad you're here.	Ita gaudeo te hic esse.
But you are the first.	Sed tu primum.
I doubt the future	Dubito futurum
But that's how it is.	Sed id quam ipsum.
I think you just need some time	Puto te solum aliquo tempore opus
Now you know what you're like.	Nunc scis quid simile es.
This I need to persuade you	Hoc tibi persuadere debeo
That's better than nothing.	Id melius quam nihil est.
It's because I feel like this	Non est quod sentio sic
So here it is.	Ita hic est.
Well, it was really bad.	Bene, vere malum fuit.
I came to the office.	Et factum est ut officium.
All I need is to believe	Mihi opus est credere omnes
I'm never going to live this far	Numquam ego hoc usque ad vivere
I definitely feel for you.	Pro certo sentio tibi.
No one knows what happened.	Quod factum est, nemo scit.
Perhaps the situation is the same.	Forsitan ita se habet.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
I really do nothing but go to school	Ego vere nihil nisi ad scholam
Boy, this is what he said	Puer, hoc est quod dixit
Nothing is possible.	Nihil potest.
I did not desire, but only it was done	Non volui, sed modo factum est
So sure you are happy.	Sic certe felix es.
He certainly is.	Ipse certe.
I wasn't sure about anything	Non eram certus de quicquam
To all, to all.	Omnibus, omnibus est.
For it was a good day.	Dies enim bonus erat.
The situation is not so.	Non ita se res habet.
I know and I'm ready for help	Scivi et auxilium paratus sum
I was supposed to know what you did.	Scire putabam quid feceris.
I told you what I could	Dixi vobis quod potui
I want this to be done already	Volo hoc fieri iam
Nothing tonight.	Nihil hac nocte.
Maybe it was necessary.	Fortasse opus erat.
I am sure time will come soon	Certus sum tempus cito
I just want to be together.	Non solum vis esse simul.
One, one, you said.	Unus, unus, dixisti.
I see what he means.	Quid sibi velit video.
I only know what she told me	Tantum scio quod non indicavit mihi
I didn't know where you'd gone	Ego nesciebam ubi velis abiit
I did what I did.	Feci quod fecit.
Not much.	Non multum.
If you don't want.	Si non vis.
I don't want to stay here	Nolo hic manere
I'm quite happy without you	Satis gaudeo sine te
I really, really wanted	Ego vere, vere voluit
I just want to tell you	Ego iustus volo tibi dicere
Better than a little	Melius quam parum
I feel really bad about that	Sentio vere malum quod
I will definitely buy more.	Certus sum plus emere.
But I wasn't anything	Ego autem non erat aliquid
If you are the same, it is fine.	Si idem es, bene est.
She doesn't even want to be friends with him.	Illa ne amicos quidem sibi esse vult.
But he knew that it could not be done.	Sed scivit fieri non posse.
I don't see myself doing	Ego non video me facere
perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.	fortasse, fortasse, fortasse.
But not always out.	Sed non semper ex.
This time he did it.	Hoc tempore fecit.
I have seen the truth	verum vidi
I have nothing to do	Ego nihil ad hoc facere
It will be so.	Sic erit.
You.	Vos.
I can't speak for sure	Non possum dicere pro certo
She has to look out for herself.	Habet vide de se.
Maybe he thought everything.	Forsitan omnia putabat.
I couldn't believe he was mine	Non potui credere eum esse meum
I had too much with him.	Nimium non habui cum eo.
I can do almost nothing here	Hic fere nihil possum facere
Let me tell you something.	Dicam tibi aliquid.
Never in that way.	Numquam illo modo.
I don't want to talk right now.	Nolo loqui nunc.
It could never be done.	Nunquam fieri posset.
Enough for me to go	Mihi satis est ire
I think about it	Ego cogitare de illo
I can't do it on my own	Non possum facere eam in mea
sorry for her indeed	Paenitet me eam quidem
I don't know what to say.	Nescio quid dicam.
You are the one who will always and never be there.	Tu es, qui semper et nunquam ibi.
I don't even know his name, but that's not	Nomen eius ne novi quidem, sed id non
Well look no further.	Bene vide nihil amplius.
This is not possible.	Hoc fieri non potest.
I feel good when you are	Sentio bonum cum es
I know people.	Novi homines.
I didn't want him to think about it now	Nolui eum nunc cogitare de eius
I know you don't get that yet	Scio te non accipere, quod tamen
I doubt	Ego dubito
I don't know what this can be	Nescio quid hoc esse potest
It would be good.	Bonum esset.
I knew better than anyone	Scivi melius quam quis
I don't see much to work	Non video quantum ad opus
I don't want to be alone again	Iterum solus esse nolo
I know it's true	Scio verum esse
I feel good getting him over there finally	Sentio bonus questus eum ibi tandem
This is not possible.	Hoc non potest.
This time is not	Hoc tempus non
He said we have one week.	Dixit nos una septimana habere.
I wonder how it looks	Miror quomodo spectat
He could not stop.	Non potuit prohibere.
Which is not seen.	Quod non videtur.
That's before.	Id ante.
You only do one time.	Tantum facit unum tempus.
how good is it for you.	ut bene sit tibi.
To get you eo	Ut te eo
I don't want to live with him	Nolo vivere cum eo
Look soon.	Vide mox.
But that which no one yet could do enough.	Sed id quod adhuc nemo satis facere potuit.
I told you when I could	Dixi vobis quando potui
What an.	Quae an.
I thought what you wanted	Cogitavi quod vellet
I saw myself, and I saw	Vidi ipse, et vidi me
Really wants you the best.	Vere optime tibi vult.
It was time to do it again.	Tempus erat iterum facere.
I wasn't there	Non essem ibi
There is.	Ibi est.
I need to know for sure	Mihi opus est scire pro certo
He could not be here.	Hic esse non potuit.
So now you are.	Sic nunc es.
Maybe or nothing.	Aliquam vel nisi.
The father never wanted her to be a wife.	Numquam pater eam uxorem esse voluit.
Which is fine.	Quod bene est.
I was sure that wasn't me	Certus eram quod non erat mecum
I love her too much to give up	Amo eam nimium dare usque
I had to make sure it was okay	Ego quoque fac bene erat
Well, it's too late.	Bene, sero est.
I'm here with you	Ego hic apud te
Maybe that's said no.	Aliquam id dictum nulla.
I think this is for me	Puto hoc est in me
Not you.	Nec te.
I'm sure I'm right about that.	Certe recte de illo sum.
No that ever before.	Nulla id semper ante.
He knew who the man was.	Sciebat quis homo esset.
But today they are not.	Sed hodie non sunt.
if this has been done.	si id factum est.
I'm going with you	Eo apud te
I believe we are in	Credo sumus per
It makes it possible.	Fieri facit.
I really think about it	Ego vere cogitare de illo
I know they are here	Scio hic sunt
But none other than him.	Nulla sed ipsum quam.
His father ought to speak.	Pater eius loqui debet.
It was everything.	Erat omnia.
I thought it would be for a while.	Putavi fore ad tempus.
I wanted to talk to him	Volui loqui ei
I hope this will be great.	Valde id spero fore.
And he's still at home.	Et domi adhuc est.
He saw her.	Vidit eam.
I can't do this again	Non possum hoc facere iterum
This does not mean.	Hoc non vult.
I didn't want to talk to me	Nolui loqui ad me
I look like you	Ego vultus amo te
There's nothing like that.	Nihil simile.
i think i have done it.	fecisse puto.
I hope to come again one day	Spero iterum venire die
You know, you do it.	Scis, facias.
I couldn't stop myself	Non potui me prohibere
Time, that's all for her.	Tempus, id est omnia ad eam.
I have nothing else to do	Ego nihil aliud facere
But it is great.	Sed est magna.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
I have a plan to do	Habeo consilium facere
This is your.	Tuum est.
I saw one.	Vidi unum.
I hope it's not	Spero autem non est
Now I'm still ahead of him.	Nunc adhuc ante id ipsum.
I just didn't want to be late	Ego iustus noluit esse sero
I know too well how good you are.	Nimium bene scio quam tu bonus es.
I just can't stop me	Ego iustus non prohibere me
But it was not done.	Sed non erat factum.
I like it too.	Placet id quoque.
I can't do anything to prevent this	Non possum facere quicquam ne haec
Maybe it was a journey.	Forsitan erat iter.
not a lot of time.	Non multum temporis.
I didn't want this to happen	Nolui hoc fieri
I don't even know	Non quidem scio
to be one.	unum esse.
No one knew much about him.	Nemo multa de eo sciebat.
I also wish you a day	Ego quoque volo te in diem
I can give you something that is already yours	Non possum dare tibi aliquid, quod iam tuum est
I could not work for days	Non potui opus dies
I was ready	Paratus essem
I think it's easy to understand what you mean.	Puto facile intelligere quid sit.
I just want to know more about you	EGO iustus volo scire de te
Never want to do it	Nunquam volo facere
But he could not know.	Scire tamen potuit.
I never did	Numquam feci
No, that's not right.	Non, id non recte.
Not for one thing	Non enim unum
And yet we are here.	Et tamen hic sumus.
Probably tonight or tomorrow.	Probabiliter hac nocte vel cras.
I hope you like it this way.	Spero tibi hoc modo placet.
He said also, say it not, say a thing.	Dixit etiam, noli id ​​dicere, rem dicere.
Me and you.	Me et te.
I can't say it all	Non possum dicere ei et omnia
It was hard to say.	Dicere difficile erat.
I only know what is not true	Tantum scio quod non est verum
I can hardly believe	Vix possum credere
Often, you are.	Saepe, es.
I hope she's doing well	Spero illa bene
I really like it	Ego vere amo eam
I can't stay here	Non possum hic manere
I could not go further	Non potui ire amplius
This was at last.	Hic fuit tandem.
Again to know why.	Iterum scire quare.
I hope that you like it	Spero autem quod tibi placet
I can't deal with this now	Non possum agere cum hoc nunc
I just need someone to talk to	Ego iustus opus ad aliquem loqui
I really want to do what is good	Ego vere volo facere quod bonum est
I could barely make it	Vix eum facere potui
That's what happened.	Id factum est.
Certainly we cannot.	Certe non possumus.
We can't anymore.	Non possumus amplius.
I don't know what it's like right now.	Nescio quid nunc simile est.
I don't care anymore	Nolo iam
perhaps he did not.	fortasse non habuit.
I think this is better	Ego puto hoc melius
I just love her so much	Ego iustus amo eam tantum
I thought of it in	Cogitavi eam in
There is no need to say.	Dicere non est opus.
I am indebted to you.	Debeo.
So, if it is, here it is.	Ita, si est, hic est.
To-morrow it is the same thing.	Cras id ipsum.
I want something	Volo aliquid
No one likes to play with him.	Nemo cum eo ludere vult.
I love you too much to do.	Nimium te amo ut facias.
He made.	Fecit.
But it is possible.	Sed fieri potest.
I didn't know what it was	Nesciebam quod esset
I did the same thing as now	Idem feci sicut nunc
I knew where it was for me	Sciebam ubi esset mihi
He could not speak.	Non potuit dicere.
You never know again.	Quae numquam iterum.
I really want you to go with me tonight.	Ego vere volo te ire mecum hac nocte.
But you never know with us.	Sed tu numquam nobiscum scis.
To really stay here tonight	Ut vere hic mane hac nocte
This is how she thought she wanted	Hoc modo putavit se velle
I can't anymore	Non possum amplius
Great, great.	Magna, magna.
I was very happy at home	Ego eram valde felix domi
It is now.	Nunc est.
We are still here.	Hic tamen sumus.
He is the same.	Ipse est.
We can't be just.	Non possumus iustus.
I tried my cum	Conatus sum mihi cum eo
What he doesn't want to say.	Quod non vult dicere.
He says that he did not know.	Dicit se nescire.
I believe in you and not everyone else	Credo in te et non omnes aliud
No question about it.	Nulla quaestio est de illo.
He saw what he saw.	Vidit quod vidit.
I am what you all hear	Ego quod omnes audire
I know you by a lot	Scio te per multum
I'm going to the room	Eo usque ad cubiculum
It's not going to happen.	Non futurum est.
I want to play with him	Volo ludere cum eo
To-morrow but before it was.	Cras sed ante erat.

No one knew what this meant.	Nemo scivit quid hoc esset.
Nor is it necessary.	Nec est necesse.

What kind it seems.	Quod genus videtur .
I know how hard this is for you	Scio quam difficile hoc sit tibi
I can't say that I'm so happy	Non possum dicere quod tam felix
I hope good	Spero bona
He doesn't want the thing.	Rem non velit.
It was his problem.	Quaestio eius fuit.
I could not tell anyone	Non potui dicere quis
I didn't want to know who it was	Nolui scire quis esset
That she did.	Id fecit.
But it was still enough.	Sed adhuc satis erat.
It seemed like a lot.	Videbatur ut sit amet.
I can't think of how you can help me	Non possum cogitare quomodo potes me adiuvet
I just want you to know.	Ego iustus volo te scire.
Forgot to be here for me	Oblitus est hic mihi
I want to believe it	Volo eam credere

You can do it.	Eum facere potes.
I need you something for me	Mihi opus est tibi aliquid de me
I knew it didn't seem so easy	Sciebam non tam facile videri

But this.	Sed id.
He did not come here.	Hic non venit.
don't do this to you	Non hoc tibi
Truly he said it.	Vere dixit id.
But it is not.	Sed non est enim.
I know what the future will be	Scio quid futurum sit
I hope that someone does help	Spero autem quod aliquis facit auxilium
But I doubt that it is so	Dubito tamen quod ita est
I didn't want to do it	Nolui ut faciam illud

Tell me what you are doing.	Dic quid facias.
All day here	Totum diem huc
I really love this	Hoc vere amo .

I'm afraid	Vereor ne.
And it is good.	Et bonum est.
I could not do without you	Non potui sine te
Please try to get it.	Aliquam ut est velit.
I just want to get there	Ego iustus volo illuc

I'm bad for him	Me malum pro eo
I can't get enough of this.	Non possum satis hoc accipere.
Finally ei	Tandem ei
Which is not enough.	Quod parum .
I saw myself	Vidi ipse
I had one, only one	Unum habui, unum tantum
School is going well and I need to work.	Schola eat bene et opus est opus.
Maybe too soon.	Forte nimium cito.
No one really speaks to me like that	Nemo vere loquitur ad me sicut quod

I just know for sure.	Modo certo scio.

I saw him	Vidi ipsum
I do my job, do it	officium meum facio, suum facit
I know it's too late now.	Sero nunc scio.
We can do anything else.	Quid aliud possumus.
I have a question here	Habeo quaestionem hic
I knew there was something else about you	Sciebam est aliquid aliud de te
I don't need to know that	Non opus est scire quod
I know what you want	Scio quid velis
This is who he is.	Hic est qui illum.
I knew more to be	Sciebam plus esse
Nothing is certain of this.	Nihil hoc certum est.
I don't know whether he was still here or not	Nescio an adhuc hic vel non esset
I don't always like to do.	Non semper placet facere.
I knew that something	Sciebam esse aliquid
I can.	Possum.
No no, no.	Non non, non.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I have enough.	satis habeo.
And it is wrong to do	Et factum est malum facere
He could not speak either.	Vel loqui non potuit.

In the night	In nocte.
But you said nothing.	Nihil tamen dixisti.
I was told not to say anything	Dictum est mihi ne aliquid dicere

I couldn't help you	Non potui vobis
No, no, no.	Non est, non.
I have to tell you now	Habeo tibi dicere nunc
I know we will be together	Scio nos esse simul
He could not know and had to know.	Scire non potuit et habuit scire.
Never be the same again.	Nunquam idem iterum.
I knew where I was	Sciebam ubi esset
That is what he could do.	Id est, quid potuit.
I did it for you tonight	Non feci tibi hac nocte
Now I am not	Iam non essem
That's what comes to mind here.	Id hic occurrit.
Just because you don't want to hurt	Sicut quod non vis ad malum
I'm glad you're here with me	Gaudeo te hic mecum
It does not please	Non placet
Go for what you want.	Pro id quod vis.
so I said.	ita dixi.
By the time	Ad tempus.
I know what you've just said	Scio quid tu modo dixit
Now that's great.	Nunc id magna est.
And certainly so me.	Et certe ita me.
I want more than this	Volo plus quam hoc
For he knew how to be able to speak without.	Sciebat enim sine posse dicere quomodo.
I need to know, I need it.	Mihi opus est scire, opus est mihi.
I've seen	Vidi ego
She never knows why it is.	Nunquam scit cur id sit.
I know what will happen to my husband	Scio quid futurum sit, ut vir meus
I don't want to find anything else	Non vis invenire aliquid aliud
It was very good.	Erat valde bona.
And this is enough.	Et hoc satis.
I don't want to think about this anymore	Non vis cogitare de hoc amplius
But never that kind	Sed numquam id genus
I had to do something for her	Ego quod ad eam aliquid
I don't know how I feel better.	Nescio quomodo melius sentio.
I don't do that.	Non facere.
Why? 	Quare?
I do not know.	Non scio.
That's not it.	Ut non est est.
But this is difficult to see.	Sed hoc difficile est videre.
I wanted the best	Optime volui
Maybe it was him.	Aliquam erat ei.
But he said.	Sed dixit.
I want it too	Ego volo nimis
I don't even know what.	Nescio quidem quid.
I already forgot	Iam oblitus sum
But this is evil.	Sed hoc est malum.
I can barely hear you think	Vix me audire possum cogitare
You know it's not true.	Scis non verum.
Don't look	Non vide.
I wanted to talk to him	Volui loqui ei

I could only help you	Potui tantum tibi

None of the above.	Nulla in dictum est.
I don't even know what.	Nescio quidem quid.
I don't believe what you say	Non credo quod dicit
And there is nothing.	Et nihil est.
But not for no reason.	Sed non nulla enim.
I didn't know who it was	Et ego nesciebam quis esset
It will likely be here soon.	Hic mox erit verisimile.
Or she's trying.	An illa conatur.
I wanted to be yours	Volui esse tuum

He didn't want you to know this.	Hoc te scire non voluit.
I don't know why it is so.	nescio cur ita sit.
I do not like.	Mihi non placet.
I told him it was already done	Dixi ei iam factum est
I don't feel much of anything	Non sentio multum quicquam
I want you in	Volo te in
I have too much to do for him	Habeo nimium facere ut pro eo
I didn't want to be that way anymore.	Nolui esse hoc modo amplius.
I have only three people from him	Ego tantum tres homines ab eo

My job is to know what else is.	Meum officium est scire quid aliud sit.

I want to stay with him	Ego volo manere cum eo
I'm still not sure what had happened recently.	Ego adhuc non certus erat quod nuper factum est.

and so it ought to be.	et sic debet.
I don't really like him.	Non vere vult eum.
But he does not want anything for me.	Sed mihi non aliquid vult .
I hope you like it.	Spero tibi placet.
A little late, you're not	A paulo sero non es
You can see the whole thing if you want to see it.	Videre potes totum si vis videre.
Tell her you will never come here again.	Dic ei numquam huc iterum venire.
I know what it is like	Scio quid sit simile
I think this could be done.	Hoc puto posse fieri.
I could have told you exactly why	Non potui dixi tibi prorsus quare
I thought you could play	Cogitavi posse ludere
See also here.	Vide etiam hic.
There's nothing in it.	Nulla in est.
I doubt it before	Dubito ante eam
So much money.	Tantum pecuniae.
I could do it myself	Me facere potui
Please try again later.	Aliquam ut dictum ante.
I knew we didn't have the money	Sciebam nos non habere pecuniam
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
It's time to ask him.	Aliquam a dictum ipsum.
I was lucky.	felix fui.
As far as you can see.	Quantum potes videre.
I was his.	ego eius fui.
I don't know, man.	Nescio, homo.
I didn't know until this morning	Ego nesciebam usque ad hanc mane
And nothing left me	Et nihil me reliquit
I never thought about you	Non cogitavi ut de te
Do you know.	Scisne.
But never will.	Sed numquam velit.
But not much.	Sed non multum.
I think you've asked enough	Puto te satis quaesivit
Never at all.	Omnino numquam.
You already know what your job is	Iam scio quod officium tuum est
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum est.
None but him none.	Nulla sed ipsum nulla.
I just didn't say	Ego iustus non dixit
I don't think you'd want to talk to me	Non puto me velle loqui usque velis
I've never heard of you	Ego numquam audivi de te
all i can do.	Omnia possum facere.
No one understood	Nemo intellexit
And you want to see me again	Et iterum vis videre
It was better for all.	Melius erat omnibus.
I just want to make sure she's happy	EGO iustus volo ut fac illa est felix
That was it.	Id erat.
I haven't really got anything to say to him	Non vere obtinuit aliquid dicere in eo
No one even knows where he is.	Nemo etiam scit ubi sit.
I'm single on my job.	Im 'unum a me officium.
i think you know what it looks like	Puto te scire quid spectat sicut
Have something with him.	Habere aliquid cum eo.
I'm not really sure of that.	Non sum vere certus in illo.
Maybe you didn't.	Fortasse numquam fecisti.
There he saw something else.	Aliud ibi vidit.
Truly it has been said.	Vere dictum est.
if not longer.	si non diutius.
I am not and I am not	non sum et non sum
He says that he does not want to be seen at the same time.	Dicit se simul videri non velle.
He looks at me.	Me spectat.
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum est.
Please don't do this to yourself.	Quaeso ne hoc tibi facias.
I don't need anything else	Non opus est aliud
Yes, okay.	Ita, bene.
never seen me like	Numquam vidi me sicut
Right, yes.	Recte, ita.
I hope it does.	Spero facit.
So, yes, so happy.	Sic, sic, sic felix.
I know what's wrong with this	Scio quid mali vis hoc
Now at least I can't stop you.	Nunc certe non possum te prohibere.
I told you already too	Dixi vobis iam nimis
I have so much to say to you	Tantum habeo tibi dicere
But there was.	Sed erat.
you never have, you know, today	numquam habes, scis, hodie
I like it when I do it	Ego amo is cum id facit
It is probable that	Probabile est id.
I don't want to go without you.	Nolo sine te proficisci.
And now I wanted it	Et nunc, ut voluit eam
It's hard not to think.	Difficile non videtur.
He says nothing.	Nihil dicit.
This time I am busy.	Hoc tempus mihi occupatus est.
I've never heard this.	Nunquam hoc audivi.
She is never without.	Numquam sine illa est.
I stay at home so	Ego mane domi, sic
But one day has been for me	Sed unus dies fuit mihi
You know what you've done.	Scis quid feceris.
He was not a man.	non erat homo.
And another great thing.	Sed et aliud magna.
.	.
They are not bad at all.	Non sunt omnino mali.
So perhaps it was not done after all.	Ita fortasse non post omnes factum est.
He did not want to know this, but he did it.	Hoc scire noluit, sed fecit.
I know everything	Scio, omnia
Got it.	Obtinuit eam.
I know my dog.	Canem meum scio.
Not even here.	Ne hic quidem.
I hope he does his job well	Spero bene facit suum officium
I can't do my work on time	Non possum facere opus meum in tempore
I can't say enough.	Non possum satis dicere.
And so he did.	Et sic fecit.
Please try or get it now.	Aliquam vel velit nunc.
He knew it would be too soon.	Mox etiam fore sciebat.
It definitely looks that way.	Certo spectat illuc.
And this is enough.	Et hoc satis est.
I thought you could not do this.	Putabam hoc tibi non posse.
I hope to live	Spero autem vivere
I don't want to be hard on you	Nolo esse difficile in te
I wanted to hear what I wanted	Volui audire quid vellem
This was not enough.	Hoc non erat satis.
I was told no more than what you have	Dictum est mihi non plus quam id quod habes
But he thinks.	Sed cogitat.
He said that he was mine.	Dixit se meum esse.
I forgot about all of it	Oblitus sum de omnibus eius
I know the good and the bad in it	scio bonum et malum in eo
There was nothing to do but see.	Nihil erat facere nisi vide.
No one has forgotten it.	Nemo eam oblitus est.
You'll never find me	Numquam ex me invenire
Yes it is true.	Ita verum est.
I thought what to say	Cogitavi quid dicam
Who I could not	Quis non potui
He's not used to it.	Non ille esse solebat.
But it is difficult for us.	Sed nobis difficile est.
I can't help yet.	Non possum adhuc.
I have plenty of time	Habeo multa tempore
That's great.	Ut id magna.
But this is not necessary.	Sed hoc non est opus.
I would never go	Volo numquam ire
I know enough to say	Satis scio dicere
I wonder what you are thinking	Miror quid cogitat
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
I want something else this time	Volo aliquid aliud hoc tempore
to think, to think, to think.	Cogitare, cogitare, cogitare.
I couldn't believe it really went	Non potui credere quod vere abiit
I'll do it if you're me	Ego faciam, si tu me
To neither.	Ut nec.
And almost everyone.	Et fere omnes.
I don't think you know who it is	Non puto scire quis sit
This is just what you want to do.	Hoc est quod mox facere velis.
I'm not so sure about this	Non sum ita certus de hoc
Well almost never.	Bene fere numquam.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
To do it	Ut faciam illud
I could never do it	Ego numquam facere potui
I feel for you.	Ego pro te sentio.
You can hear it now.	Nunc audire potes.
And there is more.	Et plus est.
Almost everything indeed.	Fere quidem omnia.
I like to see you here	Mihi placet hic videre
I would like too much, perhaps.	Nimium vellem, fortasse.
I never could say that	Numquam potuit dicere quod
It was true.	Verum erat.
I want to stay with you	Volo manere apud te
In what way.	Quo modo.
I think that's true	Puto quod verum est
I will tell you this	Dicam tibi hoc
He willed.	Voluit.
That's what we do	Id facerem nobis
I need her help	Mihi opus est ad auxilium eius
I couldn't see him until morning	Non potui videre eum usque mane
I just want to see for me	Ego iustus volo video vidi pro me
I can certainly work this now	Non possum certe opus hoc nunc
But there is more than this.	Sed plus est quam hoc.
I can't do this now	Non possum de hoc nunc
There's nothing wrong with that video	Nihil mali quod video
You, boy.	Tu, puer.
But it was so.	Sed ita erat.
I didn't think any of it	Non putavi aliquem ex eo
I could not be better	Non potui melius
I was a man.	Fui homo.
Maybe this is the same thing.	Fortasse hic idem est.
I wonder if nothing is possible	Miror si nihil est quod fieri potest
He came here.	Hic venit.
But you must not accept this.	Sed hoc accipere non debes.
He was just a good man.	vir bonus iustus erat.
I want you to say	Volo te dicere
I was one.	unum essem.
I said the future	Dixi futurum
That's very important.	Ut in ipsum magna.
I have seen these things happen	Haec vidi fieri
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla nisi.
I don't know where he is	Nescio ubi hic est
Please help with that.	Placet auxilium cum illo.
I didn't know he would act like that	Ego nesciebam se agere sicut quod
Id.	Id .
But he still did not understand.	Sed adhuc non intellexit.
I can think of nothing else but you	Nihil aliud cogitare possum nisi tu
Maybe she could do it now.	Forsitan id nunc facere posset.
I can see you there	Non possum te ibi
He could have.	Potuit habere.
I want to come and see you soon	Volo venire et videre te cito
Don't like your name	Non ut nomen tuum
it is certain.	certum est.
I wanted to know your name	Scire volui nomen tuum
If this is good.	Si id bonum est.
I can't go through this again	Non possum ire per hoc iterum
I know how badly you want me	Scio quam male vis me
But it was also very good.	Sed erat etiam multa bona.
He must do his job.	Qui officium suum facere debet.
I didn't know what was going to happen	Ego nesciebam quid futurum sit
You better stay here if only.	Tu melius hic mane si modo.
He does absolutely nothing.	Omnino nihil facit.
It will be better.	Melius erit.
I could not think.	cogitare non potui.
We are together now.	Simul nunc sumus.
I need to do something	Mihi opus est facere aliquid
I knew why, but I could not say	Scivi quare, sed non potui dicere
i never knew about it.	de hoc numquam scivi.
I dreamed like you'd like me	Vidi, sicut me velis
Say nothing to yourself.	Dic tibi nihil.
Don't like me	Non amo me
You and me.	Tu et me.
But we're here to help.	Sed hic sumus ad auxilium.
Don't just don't	Non solum non facere
I love me here	Hic amo me
Only you're okay.	Solus nimium bene.
The Father could do that which is one.	Pater, quod unum est, facere potuit.
I didn't know him enough	Et ego nesciebam eum satis
We will probably be there tomorrow.	Verisimiliter ibi cras erit.
I need to talk to the teacher	Mihi opus est loqui ei magister
I didn't think I wanted	Non putavi me velle
I have a lot to think about	Habeo multa cogitare de
But thus they are his.	Sed sic sunt eius.
I hope one day	Spero autem dies
You certainly don't want me.	Tu certe non vis.
I'll do nothing more unless you want	Nihil amplius faciam, nisi vis
He did not.	Non fecit.
I just want you to know one thing	Ego iustus volo te scire unum
that's one thing.	id unum.
I just didn't know why	Ego iustus nesciebam quare
And he has indeed.	Et habet quidem.
About.	De.
I don't even want her here tonight	Non quidem volo eam hic nocte
I don't want you at all.	Nolo te omnino.
How bad do you want it to be.	Quam- vis tibi male sit.
That's what can be done.	Id quod fieri potest.
Not just before.	Non modo ante.
Never before	Numquam ante
Yes, I am.	Ita, sum.
It is necessary to say.	Dicere necesse est.
Everything he said about me was too important.	Dixit omnia de me nimium magna fuisse.
I can't be like	Non possum non esse simile
It's time but it's some.	Aliquam sed aliquam est.
I thought of things	Cogitavi res
But no one comes.	Sed nemo venit.
I can't see why she likes him	Non possum videre quare non vult eum

I couldn't do anything about it	Non potui facere aliquid de illo

But it's a question.	Sed a quaestio est.
These things I saw and had	Haec vidi et habui
I could see me like this	Non potui videre me sic
No.	Non.

I guess that's not possible.	Suspicor id non posse.
Or perhaps?	An forte?.
You'll never see him again	Numquam videre eum iterum

I know they really help me a lot	Scio quod vere multum mihi auxilium

It seems like a lot to overcome.	Multum videtur hoc vincere.
It has not been done.	Non id factum est.
I absolutely love this	Ego omnino haec amo
Completely related to that	Omnino ad illud
I feel bad about that now	Sentio malum quod nunc
I couldn't really understand it	Non potui vere intelligere eam
I was her and mine	Essem eius et mea
This is not even certain.	Ne id quidem certum est.
But he does now.	Sed agit de modo.
I think you talk to him	Puto eum loqui
I don't know what day	Nescio quo die
I want to know more than	Volo scire plus quam
He always wants to do it.	Facere vel semper velit.
Maybe not out of the way.	Aliquam non ex modo.
But he does not.	Sed non facit.
You don't want him to see and hear something	Non vis eum videre et audire aliquid
All just good.	Iustus omnes bonum.
I did what I did yesterday and today	Ego feci quod heri et hodie
I never got to see it	Numquam obtinuit ad eam
I knew I could finally find him	Sciebam eum tandem invenire posse
here and here.	hic et hic.
We are also here.	Etiam hic sumus.
To be good.	Ut sit bonum.
I already said that	Iam dixi quod
Something needs to be done to do this.	Agere aliquid debet hoc.
He never did this.	Numquam hoc fecit.
He knows nothing.	Nihil scit.
I didn't know what day it was	Nesciebam quo die etiam esset
That's what anyone wants.	Id quis velit.
I can't see what you like so much	Non possum videre quid tibi placet tantum
Its only.	Eius modo.
I need her help	Mihi opus est ad auxilium eius
There was no such thing.	Nulla res erat.
And he did it.	Et fecit.
I want him to have what I really want	Eum volo habere quod vere vult
The name can be anything.	Nomen potest esse aliquid.
Really didn't know.	Vere nesciebat.
He said that he would do it.	Dixit se facturum esse.
But this pleases me enough.	Sed hoc satis placet.
I feel up to him	Ad eum sentio
I'm actually pretty much gone.	Ego vere satis multa abiit.
I could see her in the face	Videre potui in vultus eius
I just came home	Ego iustus venit in domum suam
I don't always do it for you	Non semper facere tibi
Couldn't think of anything.	Non potuit cogitare de aliquo.
What do you know.	Quod scis.
This was true.	Hoc verum erat.
I am still working on it	Mihi tamen opus in eo
That's for sure.	Ut est certe.
I've never been so alone	Ego numquam ita solus
I choose to believe in me more	Libet in me plus credere
Which indeed is so.	Quod quidem ita est.
I know, she knows.	Scio, illa scit.
You do too I have for sure.	Facis etiam pro certo habeo.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
I could say both	Utrumque potui dicere
A little but not much	Paulo tamen non multum
I do not think.	Non puto.
that is per se.	id est per se.
I just do my job	Ego iustus facere meum officium
Where it is.	Quo sit.
And it is in you too.	Et in te quoque est.
So I wanted, badly as it pleases me.	Sic volui, male ut placet.
What could have been done.	Quod fieri potuit.
He said nothing wrong with me.	Nihil mali dixit apud me.
I can't deal with it	Non possum agere cum eo
That's how it is.	Id ut est.
Someone loves you.	Aliquis te amat.
I could not be better	Non potui melius
I thought this was very good.	id ipsum bonum putavi.
And his father.	Et pater eius.
I can't let anyone get it done	Non possum ne quis id quod factum est
I don't need a hug.	Non opus est amet.
I think you are right.	Recte puto.
You are not nationality.	Non genus.
I came to the office.	Et factum est ut officium.
I think something else has to happen	Puto aliquid aliud habet esse futurum
Yes you are here.	Etiam hic es.
You don't really need to act well.	Non vere etiam agere debes.
I'm sorry, but it has to be.	Paenitet, sed sic habet esse.
I am with him	Ego cum eo
It is impossible to do so.	Fieri non potest ut ita.
yes, no, it's not.	Etiam non aliquam est.
But he had for sure.	Sed pro certo habuit.
The first time I see	Primum video.
But not only this.	Sed hoc non solum.
I told him to stop	Et dixit ad eum ut prohibere
Yes that is.	Etiam ut est.
The whole thing was here.	Totum hic erat.
I am not the same person.	Non sum idem homo.
I didn't know what it was	Ego nesciebam quid esset
He would not believe it.	Credere nolebat.
I really like to appreciate	Ego vere amo ut bene
I could see nothing and hear nothing	Nihil potui videre et nihil audire
I didn't know what but something	Ego nesciebam quid, sed aliquid
I want you to do something	Volo te facere aliquid
I need to give it to you	Debeo tibi dare pro eo
I do not think.	Non puto.
I'm going to help you.	Eo tibi auxilio.
I have something to say to you	Habeo tibi aliquid dicere
he could not do it.	facere non potuit.
I really want to be there again	Ego vere vis esse illuc iterum
I was still doing the job	Eram tamen facere officium
I am sure.	certus sum.
I wanted to stay there	Ibi mane volui
He loves me so much, and you like me so much.	Me ita amat, et tu sicut me ita.
I could give it much more	Eam dare potui multo amplius
It was too much to accept.	Nimium erat accipere.
I need to go.	Ire debeo.
I don't even feel I'm doing anything	Non etiam sentio me facere quicquam
Not as much.	Non quam.
I thought I could be more than one	Putabam me plus posse esse quam unum
I heard you this time	Audivi te hoc tempore
He could do a lot of things.	Potuit multum.
Is it not?	Estne.
I've been out lately.	Ex me nuper fui.
I didn't want to think	Nolui cogitare
he did not see me.	non vidit me.
I thought you were coming alone	Solus venire cogitavi te
I didn't want to do	Non volui facere
I wanted to do this.	Hoc facere volui.
And indeed nothing comes from it.	Et quidem ex eo nihil venit.
But that's none of it.	Sed id nulla ex.
I think it's going to be fun.	Puto futurum ut amet.
I can help with this kind of things	Ego potest auxilium esse ex hoc genus omnia
I am a just man.	vir iustus sum.
It's in everything.	Est in omnibus.
I want to tell you no	Volo tibi dicere non
But I don't believe in him.	Sed non ipsum in.
I want you to get a job	Ego volo te accipere officium
Nothing at all.	Prorsus nihil est.
I don't see this	Ego non hanc
I couldn't do it alone	Non potui id solum
No one said that.	Nulla quis dictum quam.
He thought it better to go and see him.	Melius se putabat ire et eum videre.
It is true.	Verum est.
today not so much.	Hodie non tam.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
I know you more than you are me	Scio te plus quam tu mihi
But it was said.	Sed dictum erat erat.
And this is what He wanted to do.	Et hoc est quod facere voluit.
What you need is the job	Quod opus sit officium
Now I'm from all and all	Modo me ab omnibus et omnibus
Doing a very good job.	Faciens officium ipsum bonum.
To get this job done.	Ut hoc officium esset.
Well not likely.	Bene non verisimile.
I knew what I needed lately	Sciebam quod opus nuper
Will definitely stay there again.	Certum est manere ibi iterum.
I can't do this all day	Non possum hoc facere totum diem
I could see him getting up to	Questus est ad eum videre potui
I didn't know much about anything	Et ego nesciebam quid de multa
I want you to come with us	Volo te venire nobiscum
i thought maybe.	Putabam fortasse.
I could do it again	Non potui facere iterum
He again	Ipse iterum
I don't think you could.	Non puto te posse.
i'm very happy	Sum valde felix
He could not speak.	Non potuit dicere.
He does it for me too.	Mihi quoque id facit.
I don't know what he's talking about.	Nescio quid loquitur.
He is who and what you are.	Is est qui et quid es.
I could not accept that	Non potui accipere quod
I can't get one there	Non possum unum ibi
Look there, all of you.	Vide ibi, omnes.
I hope that's well today	Spero quod bene hodie
But only save.	Sed non nisi nisi.
I tried to understand	Conatus sum intelligere
He had some work.	Aliquid opus habuit.
That's really bad.	Id vere malum est.
But in this way, which it is never seen.	Sed hoc modo, quod nunquam videtur.
You will need a lot	Multum necesse erit
I heard pretty good things about it.	Audivi satis bona de eo.
but he wished to remain.	sed manere voluit.
I don't see her doing it.	Non video eam facere.
I just saw you in	Ego iustus vidi te in
I didn't know much about him	Ego nesciebam multa de eo
I need your help to do something	Opus auxilium tuum ad aliquid
I know you there	Scio te ibi
I wanted this.	Hoc volui.
All this for sure.	Hoc certe totum.
No one was with us.	Nemo erat nobiscum.
I want you to stay with me	Volo te manere apud me
I really believe this	Ego vere credo hoc
There is no need to believe	Non opus est credere
He does this for certain.	Certum est hoc facit.
By this I wanted to see.	per hoc volui videre.
I just can't help me	Ego iustus non auxilium me
I want to talk about us	Volo loqui de nobis
Are you for him?	Esne pro eo?.
Don't discuss this here	Non de hoc hic
I can only say so much.	Tantum possum dicere tantum.
i can see.	videre possum.
I don't want to be like this	Non vis esse sic
sorry to see you.	Paenitet te videre.
Don't talk too long.	Ne diu quidem loqui.
He knew it was going to be good.	Sciebat bonum futurum.
I don't want to be here at all	Nolo omnino hic esse
I can't do what you say	Non possum facere quod dicit
Now I don't think things like that.	Nunc similis res non videtur.
Not for you.	Non tibi.
But you cannot do this.	Sed hoc facere non potes.
This was enough for me.	Hoc mihi satis fuit.
I've seen it again this time	Iterum me vidi quo tempore
He wants to know who he is.	Scire vult quis sit.
Who do you think will make money on it.	Quis putas pecuniam in illo facere.
I could barely see	Videre vix potui
I can't stop what happened to me	Non possum prohibere quod factum est ad me
I like this boy very much	Mihi placet hic puer valde
Maybe you have.	Forsitan habes.
That hardly seems today.	Quod hodie vix videtur.
No one is there.	Nulla quis est.
I want to understand it	Volo intelligere eam
But so it is.	Sed, sic est.
Yes, it was not said now, it was not always.	Etiam dictum non nunc, non semper erat.
It is not true.	Non est vere.
But pretty well.	Sed satis bene.
I didn't want to talk to him	Nolui loqui ei
My, not yours.	Meum, non tuum.
I could see.	videre potui.
I have seen for a long time, for a long time	Vidi diu, diu
They are there exactly.	Ibi prorsus.
How hard it is.	Quam difficile est.
I am just glad to have it for me	Ego iustus gaudeo illum habere me
You don't want me to be like that	Non vis primum esse simile quod
It was great.	Erat magna.
I can't believe what you just said	Non possum credere quod modo dictum est
Do not do it.	Facere non.
I couldn't help it at that time	Non potui auxilio illo tempore
I couldn't believe what got us lucky	Non potui credere quod felix obtinuit nos
He did not see her.	Non vidit eam.
You know what is going to happen.	Tu quid futurum sit.
You know, you don't need to do it.	Scis, non debes facere.
I think that's going to happen.	id futurum puto.
That's my name.	Id nomen mihi est.
But I have not said no.	Sed non dictum nulla.
It was probable indeed.	Probabile quidem fuit.
We'll be fine.	Bene nobis erit.
Yes it is.	Etiam est.
But it is still true.	Sed tamen verum est.
for I will be there for her	Ego enim ibi esse eius
I know this only for a period of time	Scio hoc modo ad tempus
I knew what he meant.	Sciebam quid vellet.
A nothing.	A nihil.
But it is not so difficult.	Sed non ita difficile est.
I certainly think that's	Ego certe puto quod est
I certainly never heard anything about it	Ego certe numquam aliquid de eo audivi
You've never been to me.	Numquam mihi.
Name!.	Nomen!.
I see her looking at me	Video vultus eius ad me
You only need to believe in yourself.	Tantum debes credere in te.
That could help.	Quod adiuvare posset.
I want to know how to do this.	Scire volo quomodo hoc facias.
I thought it was too soon	Putavi esse cito
Never do anything more	Numquam facere aliquid amplius
He went home.	Abiit domum.
don't make it from you	Non eam a te
You are so good.	Tam bonus es.
Not just as one himself	Non tantum ut unus ipse
This only applies.	Hoc solum habet.
I can't have anything to do anymore	Hoc facere non possum habere quicquam amplius
No statement from any.	Nulla dictum aliquam ex.
You'd better stay.	Melius manere velis.
I wanted to tell you myself	Ipse tibi volui dicere
No one yet comes.	Nemo tamen venit.
I don't have anything.	Non habeo quicquam.
Maybe not well, he thought.	Forsitan non bene, ille putabat.
Again like you have.	Iterum simile habes.
This is to help me.	Hic est ut me adiuvet.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
This could be good or bad.	Posset hoc esse bonum vel malum.
Everything is good.	Omnia est bonum.
I have something else to do	Habeo aliquid aliud facere
That morning was lucky.	Illa mane felix fuit.
He does both very well.	Utrumque autem optime facit.
and yet.	et adhuc.
We're here to help.	Hic sumus ad auxilium.
I know you still have.	Scio te adhuc habere.
I just love you so much	Ego iustus amo tantum
I will make it first	Ego eam primum
Can't hear.	Non potest audire.
I knew what it was	Sciebam id quod erat
I thought this was a little easy	Hoc parum facile putavi
You can always.	Semper potes.
I can't speak for sure right now.	Pro certo nunc dicere non possum.
If not now, soon.	Si non nunc, mox.
Maybe with him?.	Forsitan cum illo ?.
Certainly it was done.	Certe factum est.
did not succeed.	non obtinuit.
I have more in that	Ego autem plus in eo
Not where we are.	Non ubi sumus.
You can trust someone with a dog.	Canem potes credere cum aliquo.
But there was also time.	Sed et tempus erat.
But it is possible.	Sed fieri potest.
I'm afraid lest it be true	Vereor ne verum sit
To fight for yourself.	Ut pro te ipsum.
It's fine now.	Bene nunc est.
He came here.	Hic venit.
Time to look new.	Tempus vultus novi.
But it was necessary.	Sed necesse erat.
I know nothing about this	Scio nihil de hoc
all the way up.	usque omnes.
It's not easy for you	Non hoc facile tibi
I hope you can do the same with you.	Spero te id apud te idem facere posse.
i never thought this was bad.	numquam id malum putavi.
It was not a matter.	Nec rem.
I thought I was definitely not there.	Putavi non certo ibi fuisse.
I can't get out of it now	Non possum non ex eo nunc
Unless, it was, not, no more.	Nisi, erat, non, amplius.
I want you to come to me	Volo te ad me venire
I don't have a house without him	Non habeo domum sine eo
I know yours too.	Novi etiam tuum.
I hope all will be well	Spero omnes bene erit
They are not the same.	Non sunt idem.
I had so much to do	Ego quoque tantum facere
You have done nothing.	Nihil fecisti.
I like it here.	Hic mihi placet.
It was in him.	In in ipsum erat.
That's not a great idea.	Ut in magna ex, non.
I don't want to be here	Nolo hic fieri
You don't want to stay longer than it is necessary	Non vis manere diutius quam necesse est
You can't see it the first time.	Primum illud videre non potes.
This is between us.	Hoc inter nos est.
It's a very tense affair.	Res est valde temporis.
You know it all.	Scis illud.
No one knew why.	Cur nemo scivit.
I could not help it	Non potui auxilio
I can do exactly	Prorsus facere possum
It's very good.	Ipsum bonum est.
I am getting used to it	Questus sum ad eum
But neither did he.	Sed nec quam.
yes not the same.	Etiam non ipsum.
Well you need to.	Bene debes.
All these things I never thought could be here	Haec omnia numquam putavi posse hic esse
That could be the same thing.	Posset idem esse qui.
I have nothing to do with it	Habeo nihil facere cum illo
Now I need your help	Nunc opus auxilium tuum
It was good, really good.	Bonum erat, vere bonum.
You need me here.	Mecum hic opus est.
That's how important it is.	Ut sit amet quam enim.
He doesn't want to say	Non vult dicere
I want to know who he is here	Scire volo quis eum hic
But I beg you, don't do anything.	Sed quaeso, ne quid facias.
It's hard enough.	Satis difficile est.
I think it could be done.	fieri posse puto.
never been and perhaps never will be.	numquam fuit et fortasse numquam erit.
I want to see for me	Volo videre pro me
I can't do anything	Non possum facere quicquam
You know.	Scis.
I said yes, it was okay with me	Dixi sic, bene erat mecum
I've done it before	Feci ante
I did not say this	non dixi hoc modo
Would that he would be with us today.	Utinam hodie nobiscum esset.
i thought	Putabam
I am not very well.	Non sum valde bene.
I just didn't know who to talk to	Ego iustus nesciebat quis loqui
I don't know what to do like	Nescio quid simile facere
It was good.	Bonum erat.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
I can't believe it's been a long time	Credere non possum iam diu
Yours is true.	Tuum est verum.
I used to know what this meant	Eram ut quid hoc esset
I hope you haven't left already	Spero autem non reliquit iam
He willed, he willed.	Voluit, voluit.
He's with me now.	Hic nunc mecum est.
I know you can't	Scio non potest
I want this to be about me	Volo hoc esse de me
But it is not so.	Sed non est ita.
He is not gone.	Non abiit.
I had a lot of time with my family	Ego quoque multum temporis cum mea
I saw it	Vidi in eam
He does not even know this.	Ne hoc quidem scit.
And yet there was no one like him.	Et tamen non erat qui similis ei.
Or perhaps not anymore.	Vel fortasse non amplius.
I can't help myself anymore	Non possum me amplius
I am ready for this job	Ego paratus sum ad hoc officium
and it was probably true.	et verisimiliter verum fuit.
But you have a book.	Sed habes librum.
I have to make it home	Habeo facere eam in domum suam
I am not the man you want to be	Ego non sum homo vis esse
I don't know where it is.	Nescio ubi sit.
I didn't know what to do	Nesciebam quid faciendum
Which is quite difficult.	Quod satis difficile est.
I couldn't believe what we just left	Non potui credere quod sicut nos reliquit
I feel so alive.	Sic me sentio vivere.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
I was a man nothing would happen	Fui homo nihil futurum
You need to know what has happened to you.	Scire debes, te dicere, quid acciderit.
I didn't say anything	Non dixit aliquid
I could never.	numquam potui.
I made my name too	Ego feci nomen meum etiam
He has the same guy.	Habet idem guy.
I think you have a good time	Puto te habere tempus bonum
I see men, men	Video homines, homines
I heard nothing	Nihil audivi
not quite well.	Non satis bene.
Well, maybe not.	Bene, fortasse.
You can definitely do that.	Quod ex certo potes.
It was important it was.	Aliquam sit amet erat erat.
I can't do it without you.	Sine te id facere non possum.
In one's self.	In quis ipsum.
I want it all for you	Volo eam ad vos omnes
You can learn many things.	Scire potes quod multa.
He truly loves you, you know.	Vere amat te, tu scis.
I rejoice, man.	gaudeo, vir.
Please help.	Placet auxilium.
I heard not much and I said yes	Audivi non multum, et dixi, quod sic
I know what it means to be all	scio quid sit se esse omnia
i love her so much.	tantum eam amo.
I couldn't believe what happened recently	Non potui credere quod nuper factum est
I don't want anything to do with it.	Nolo aliquid cum illa facere.
and this is yours.	et hoc tuum est.
But that is now.	Sed id nunc est.
And in the morning	Et mane.
I could do something that recently happened	Non potui aliquid quod nuper factum est
I feel like we've already met	Sentio sicut nos iam occurrit
All is well.	Omnia bene.
I can't sit this	Non possum hoc sit
I have nothing wrong to say about this.	De hoc nihil mali habeo dicere.
I need to talk to him as soon as possible.	Mihi opus est quam primum loqui ei.
But not so much as a wife.	Sed tantum non uxorem.
to him.	ad ipsum.
It will not be.	Non erit.
I can't hear you anymore	Non possum te audire amplius
I will not.	Nolo.
Not this for sure	Non hoc pro certo
It is important to save yourself.	Aliquam sit amet nisi ut ipsum.
in is in, out of, out of.	In est in, ex est, ex.
This is nothing new.	Hic nihil novi est.
But no one said anything.	Sed quis dictum nulla.
I want to stop it now	Volo eam prohibere nunc
I'm not ready to be mine	Paratus sum non esse mea
It will be.	Erit.
I want you and I need you	Volo te et opus est tibi
He did the thing.	Is rem fecit.
This is not what can be done in this way.	Hoc non est quod hoc modo fieri possit.
I hope it is so	Spero quod ita sit
Nothing more for her.	Nihil amplius ad eam.
I told him not to do it.	Dixi ei ne faceret.
I was now up to it	Eram nunc ad eam
I only hope it will be a good one day	Tantum spero fore ut bona una die
He is, not himself.	Ipse est, non ipse.
but only for the day.	sed modo ad diem.
He really did very good for me.	Is me vere valde bona fecit.
I had a good time	Ego quoque tempus bonum
He said he would like to know the guy.	Dixit se guy scire.
He said he didn't do it.	Dixit se non facere.
Tell me who it was who did this.	Dic mihi quis esset qui hoc fecerit.
I don't do it at all.	Non id omnino.
I will definitely make it again	Certus sum eam iterum
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
You are right.	Recte vos.
We have to do something.	Sumus aliquid habere.
It was still early.	Mane adhuc erat.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
I can't stay here.	Hic manere non possum.
I don't feel very good.	Non sentio multum bonum.
I haven't asked you.	Non te rogavit.
Man made all alone	Homo fecit omnia solus
He went and left me.	Abiit et me reliquit.
not to have said	Non dixisse
It just looks bad.	Hoc solum spectat malum.
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id dictum ipsum.
I wonder what you say	Miror quod sic dicit
People don't talk much about it.	Homines non multum loqui de illo.
I want to get her close	Volo ut eam in proxima
You want me to help you.	Vis me tibi adiuvare.
I only see what will work	Tantum video quid erit opus
The question itself.	Quaestio ipsum.
I don't really know it.	Non vere scivi.
I told you nothing else than you	Dixi vobis, nihil aliud quam vos
Looks like your first job.	Spectat ut amet officium.
They are not from someone, not from someone.	Non ab aliquo, non ab aliquo sunt.
She said nothing at first.	Illa primum nihil dixit.
That is possible.	Quod fieri potest.
I still think about it to this day	Ego tamen cogitare de eo usque ad hanc diem
We sort it out.	Nos genus illud.
Even my father did it, and he never did anything else.	Etiam pater meus fecit, qui numquam aliud fecit.
This is now certain.	Hoc nunc certum est.
You can't think how much it is.	Non potes cogitare quantum sit.
And you.	Et tu.
I appreciate your help in doing this	Ut bene auxilium tuum in hoc facere
I can't really.	Non possum vere.
It will be.	Erit.
I never had you.	Numquam erat te.
I knew this already.	Jam id sciebam.
For he knew to go first.	Sciebat enim primum ire.
I haven't seen him lately	Non vidi eum nuper
He should not see me.	Me videre non debet.
I don't need you to do this.	Non opus est vobis hoc facere.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
We are and we are.	Nos sumus et sumus.
Which is not at all.	Quod omnino non est.
Plan for me all day with him	Totum diem ad me consilium cum eo
That's the same thing.	Ut id ipsum.
I saw her, she told me	Vidi eam, quae dixit mihi
I really go for it.	Ego vere pro eo.
I just love her.	Ego iustus amo eam.
I thought about it a lot at the time	Cogitavi de illo tempore multum
He doesn't say much.	Non multum dicit.
You don't want to have it always	Non vis habere eam semper
I've never seen one before	Numquam vidi unum ante
As it was from me now	Ut ex me erat, nunc
I wanted fun today	Volui amet hodie
i have so much to say about it.	tantum habeo de eo dicere.
Now he does.	Iam agit.
I was not listening	Non eram audire
Now I know how bad it is	Nunc scio quam malum sit
Often it is so, I doubt not.	Saepe ita est, non dubito.
I don't need to stay	Non manere debeo
He did what he meant.	Faceret quae esset.
I believe it is the same for all	Credo idem est omnibus
I also	Ego quoque
He also said.	Etiam dictum.
I really like to hear from him	Ego vere amo audire ab eo
This plan has been successful	Hoc consilium fuit felix
I don't know what happened to me.	quid mihi acciderit nescio.
A good man, a good man.	Vir bonus, vir bonus.
I was not easy to give so easy	non eram facile dare tam facile

He didn't think so.	Non putabat.
But it is not enough.	Sed parum.

Too much too soon.	Nimium cito.
Yes or always please.	Etiam vel semper velit.
I knew exactly what she was talking about	Prorsus sciebam quid illa de

We can have nothing.	Nihil habere possumus.
I could not think of a wife	Uxorem non potui cogitare
And got nothing.	Et nihil obtinuit.
Say yes to	Dicam quod sic est
I thought it would be hard	Putavi fore difficile
She really doesn't like it.	Illa vere non placet.
You don't have to buy anything.	Non tibi aliquid emere.
And it was good for me.	Et fuit mihi bona.
He did good to me in that way.	Bonum mihi fecit illo modo.
I knew you in you	Sciebam te in te
Much more than you can think.	Multum plus quam potes cogitare.
This is enough.	Hoc satis est.
Maybe he still did.	Fortasse tamen fecit.
I thought for sure.	Putavi certe.
This is very, very bad.	Hoc est, valde, valde malum.
I had everything	Totum me habui
And it will be.	Et erit.
I'll tell you one thing.	Dicam tibi unum.
My father never met me.	Pater numquam occurrit mihi.
I had so much work to do	Tantum opus habui facere
But he cannot do it.	Sed id facere non potest.
But not by means of.	Sed non per.
It's too hard.	Nimis difficile est.
I probably should have	Ego probabiliter debet habere
Today is different.	Hodie aliud est.
This is going to happen.	Hoc futurum est.
I can't stay there anymore	Non possum manere ibi amplius
It is time to act.	Tempus est agere.
I'm certain I could be one	Certum sum unum esse posse

I can't do much	Non possum multum
I don't feel bad not to say	Non sentio malum non dicere
I knew what happened	Sciebam quod factum est
It was so.	Sic erat.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
I know you can hear us	Scio te posse nos audire
Nothing was done that was good.	Nihil factum, quod esset bonum.
I think you are too	Puto te quoque est
I was with him.	essem cum illo.
Longer if necessary.	Diutius, si opus sit.
He didn't want to do it.	Noluit ut faceret.
And it began.	Et incepit.
I can't, but I could	Non possum quidem, sed potuit
It is not for us.	Non est nobis.
This was one thing.	Hoc unum erat.
But perhaps it is not.	Sed fortasse non est.
I'd like to see you.	Libet te videre.
He was with me.	Mecum erat.
Maybe even that.	Fortasse etiam id.
I don't know what he's trying to tell me.	Nescio quid ille mihi narrare conatur.
He asked what he said.	Quaesivit quid dixit.
I didn't know how to do this	Ego nesciebam quomodo hoc esse
It is the same for me.	Idem mihi est.
I didn't know you were together	Ego nesciebam simul es
I just know him by someone	Ego iustus scio eum per aliquem
I was alone this time	Solus eram hoc tempore
It's definitely not much.	Suus 'certus non multum.
It was just a look.	Erat vide.
Haven't met you yet	Non occurrit vobis adhuc
But to do this is not to say anything.	Sed hoc non est facere aliquid dicere.
There is a time when you don't want to.	Est tempus, quo non vis.
I didn't want to say this to you	Nolui dicere hoc tibi
Who knows, man.	Quis scit, homo.
What you will do, come to me.	Quod facturus es, ad me venit.
Please be happy.	Sis felix.
If you do, this is for you.	Si feceris, hoc tibi est.
He did not do evil.	Male non fecit.
It does not have.	Is non habet.
I don't know you.	Nescio vos.
I wanted to know more about it	Scire volui de eo
But this does not seem to be true.	Hoc autem verum esse non videtur.
I have only one me	Habeo unum solum me
His father refused.	Pater eius noluit.
I don't like to say	Non amo dicere
I know him, he knows me.	Ego scio eum, ipse me novit.
I see too much before and a little something else	Nimium video ante et paulo aliud
He knows better.	Melius novit.
I'm afraid to	Vereor ut
I know you mean well	Scio vis bene
Yes, so badly.	Sic, sic male.
Tonight I thought it better for me	Hac nocte cogitavi ut melius mihi
I'm really sorry I have to be this way	Ego vere paenitet me hoc modo esse habet
I could not believe at all.	Non potui omnino credere.
It was perhaps too late, but	Sero fortasse erat, sed .
I know not all yours	Scio non omnia tua, sed
I really wanted to see them all	Ego vere voluit ad omnes
They just don't win.	Non solum non vincere.
I want you something	Volo tibi aliquid
I just don't have time please.	Ut non tempus velit.
It can't be morning.	Mane non potest esse.
If this is what you have, it is well.	Si hoc est quod habes, bene est.
I do not see.	Non video.
Only man.	Solus homo.
But what would he do? 	Sed quid faceret?
I want to help me	Volo ut me adiuvet
It was good to come to you.	Bene tibi fuit venire.
I'm not doing it.	Nec me faciens.
I don't say much else.	Non multum aliud dicam.
I hope yours goes well.	Bene spero tua.
I don't know what, but he does.	Nescio quid, sed facit.
You are a good man.	Bonus es homo.
This does not work very well.	Hoc non optime facit.
You are not right.	Non recte.
It will be fine.	Bene erit.
He did play well last year.	Ille proximo anno bene ludere fecit.
But no one knew that it was his.	Quod nemo scivit quod eius esset.
I never, never wanted this to happen	Numquam, numquam volui hoc fieri
You should never do it.	Numquam id facere debes.
It's time to take time for yourself.	Aliquam ut tempus ipsum.
No one wants it out.	Nulla id velit ex.
I don't want to believe him	Non vis credere ei
It's with or without you.	Est cum vel sine te.
They are still together.	Adhuc una sunt.
The same is true.	Ita ipsum.
Until that day	Usque ad diem illum.
We are always.	Semper sumus.
I can't be with you anymore	Non possum tecum amplius
He and my husband go to school together.	Ipse et vir meus simul ad scholam.
I couldn't believe how quickly it came	Non potui credere quam cito factum est
i love, so, so much	amo, ita, tantum
It will not be so.	Non ita erit.
This is not okay.	Hoc non est bene.
He knew what he was doing.	Sciebat quid faceret.
But not as much.	Sed non quam.
Good morning breakfast.	Bonum prandium mane.
I said I'm pretty	Dixi me esse satis
There is so much to do now.	Tantum est, ut faciam nunc.
I don't always do	Non semper facere
I won't tell you this	Non dicam tibi hoc
I know that he loves you	Scio quod te amat
I just can't go back to it.	Modo non potest ire ad illud.
I knew this was going to be really bad.	Sciebam hoc futurum esse vere malum.
I can't go this alone	Non possum non solum hoc ire
I don't know you.	Non te novi.
That is true.	Illud est verum.
I could understand about	De intelligere potui
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
It was finally done.	Tandem factum est.
He wanted to speak.	Voluit dicere.
for you know that it is not possible.	non enim scis posse.
I know how hard it is	Scio quam difficile sit
But where .	Sed ubi .
I could come see	Venire potui videre
I can't say you don't want	Non possum dicere non vis
Maybe tomorrow you're gone again.	Fortasse cras te iterum abiit.
Well, well, so it is.	Bene, bene, sic est.
i never saw her.	numquam eam vidi.
I want to be the one who does	Volo esse qui facit
and left.	et reliquit.
I heard but not speaking	Audivi autem non loqui
The teacher said nothing.	Magister nihil dixit.
I need to do this on my own	Mihi opus est hoc facere in mea
There is no question.	Nulla quaestio est.
Now he comes for the first time.	Nunc primum venit.
You should also.	Debes etiam.
I believe this very thing.	Id ipsum credo.
Know what's happened	Scire quid acciderit
But his face was good enough.	Sed ipse vultus eius satis fuit.
I didn't do that to him	Non facere quod ei
I do not believe.	Non credo.
Because I wanted to accept	Pro eo volui me accipere
That's what happened here.	Id quod hic factum est.
I'll do it for you.	Faciam tibi.
I just don't listen	Ego iustus non audire
he did not know his real name.	verum nomen eius nesciebat.
I don't even have	Non quidem habere
I'd like to be done soon.	Libet fieri cito.
I think nothing but help us	Puto nihil nisi nos adiuvet
It's in us.	Est in nobis.
I knew he was doing well together	Sciebam se facere bene una
But it is not the same.	Sed non est simile.
I wasn't sure where to see	Non eram certus ubi vide
And scared of him.	Et vix eius.
Well done.	Bene factum est.
That is not possible.	Quod non potest.
i love both.	utrumque amo.
But not all.	Sed non omnia.
Maybe too much.	Nimium fortasse.
Not much, but got it.	Non multum, sed obtinuit.
we are here.	nos hic esse.
I tried it	Conatus sum ab eo
There she thought.	Ibi putavit.
You can say whatever you want.	Potes dicere quod vis.
I can't think of night	Non possum cogitare de nocte
You're so lucky to have me	Ut sis felix ad te mecum
One boy looked like a man.	Puer unus vidi sicut vir.
I didn't know what it was.	Ego nesciebam quid esset.
I didn't want you to live like this.	Nolui te sic vivere.
But your plan is the same.	Sed idem consilium tuum est.
Hard to understand for you	Difficile est intelligere pro te
I want to go do everything with you	Volo ire facere omnia tecum
I will be here for you	Ego hic esse pro te
I heard people talking about it	Audivi homines de eius
That man could not	Quod homo non potui
Nothing to do with him.	Nihil ad ipsum.
Don't listen to her.	Noli eam audire.
I'll tell him what he wants.	Dicam quid sibi velit.
Maybe it's time for us to talk with him again.	Fortasse tempus est nos cum eo iterum loqui.
Nothing has been done.	Nihil factum est.
I already know enough	Iam satis scio
I forgot how to live	Oblitus sum quomodo vivere
I think you know what to do	Puto te scire quid facere
I have to do this	Hoc mihi faciendum est
Now he is gone.	Nunc abiit.
But it is not so.	Sed non ita est.
I do so.	ego id.
I will not do it again.	Non faciam illud.
It's time for nothing, it's always the same thing.	Aliquam id nulla enim, id semper ipsum.
This he did to me.	Hoc mihi fecit.
But time	Sed tempus.
What?	An, quod.
he was behind him.	post eum fuit.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
I just want to go home	Ego iustus volo ire in domum suam
Take some time and yourself.	Aliquam et tempus ipsum.
And that's what.	Et est id quod.
These things are.	Res haec sunt.
I'm sure that's done to say nothing	Ego certe quod factum est ei nihil dicere
My father is like a man to me.	Homo pater similis est mihi.
If it is too difficult, you can do it.	Si nimis difficile est, id facere posse.
I don't know who this person is.	Nescio quis hic homo sit.
Nothing is.	Nihil est.
I just got so scared too.	EGO iustus vix obtinuit ut nimis.
This is not done now.	Hoc modo non est factum.
And he loves him.	Et ipsum amet.
He has him.	Habet eum.
I couldn't stop listening	Non potui non prohibere audire
That is .	Id est .
I think it is after me	Puto esse post me
What he wanted.	Quae vellet.
I know everything is with you	Scio quae est apud te
Everything to plan.	Omnia ad consilium.
I told you I could not	Dixi te non posse
I will fight for him.	Ego pro eo.
He says nothing.	Nihil dicit.
I'll never let you go for a long time	Numquam ego te, ut diu
I just want us to be friends	Ego iustus volo nos esse amicos
This was not at home.	Hoc domi non erat.
Tomorrow it was nothing.	Cras id erat nisi.
Buys everything, don't even see.	Omnia emit, ne videre quidem.
So it was in us.	Sic in nobis fuit.
I thought it was easy	Facile putavi
I am about to do something new for you	Ego sum ut aliquid novi pro te
This was true.	Hoc verum erat.
I didn't know what to say.	Quid dicam nesciebam.
But he was in none.	Sed in nulla erat.
I don't want this to happen.	Nolo hoc fieri.
I told you to make yourself at home	Dixi tibi facere te domi
i want help.	auxilium volo.
How often should.	Quam saepe ut.
He could not speak too bad.	Nimis malum loqui non potuit.
It would be great if anyone could help me.	Magna esset si quis me adiuvet.
I wonder what it is about	Miror quid sit de
Yes, that's some.	Etiam id aliquam est.
Nothing has been said before.	Nulla in dictum ante.
I don't like it much.	Non multum placet.
You've got to do better than that.	Melius quam te facere obtinuit.
I will say nothing.	Nihil dicam.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
I want to say something.	Dicere volo aliquid.
Father, tell me.	Pater, dic mihi.
But see this.	Sed hoc vide.
I just never did.	Modo numquam.
For it is not.	Non enim.
I hope to do everything soon	Spero facere omnia cum
What did you say about him?	Quid de eo dixisti.
Totally like you.	Prorsus amo te.
Men are like us.	Homines sunt sicut nos.
We are not one.	Non unum sumus.
There is nothing you can do.	Non est quod facere potes.
As I was told so	Sicut dictum est mihi ut sic
I hope you will work on this with me	Spero autem in hoc opus erit mecum
And perhaps that is good.	Et fortasse id bonum est.
I wanted for a dog	Canem pro volui
I can't be with you	Non possum tecum
It was my first work.	Ante meum erat opus.
I really hope that	Ego vere spero ut quod
I'll be there on time	Ego te ibi in tempore
That was not true.	Quod non erat verum.
But there was no time.	Sed nec tempus erat.
i think i need to do this	Puto hoc facere opus est
I want to play well.	Ludere etiam volo.
I can't help how big this thing is.	Non possum quam magna haec res sit.
But this is certainly true.	Sed hoc certe verum est.
Never again.	Iterum numquam.
He willed, he did it.	Voluit, fecit.
But there was some.	Erat sed aliquam.
Not me yet.	Non me tamen.
One, you don't want to be true.	Unum, non vis verum esse.
This is if you did the same.	Hoc est, si idem feceris.
She loves enough.	Satis amat.
Well, that was absolutely true.	Bene, quod erat omnino verum.
I need to keep me busy	Mihi opus est ut mihi occupatus
It is also great.	Etiam magna.
I have not forgotten it.	Non oblitus est.
He was alone, you know.	Solus erat, tu scis.
I haven't seen you yet	Non vidi adhuc
I didn't want to talk about what I've just met	Nolui loqui quod nuper occurrit
I want to do it myself.	Volo me facere.
I could almost see	Fere videre potui
I can't believe this	Non possum credere hoc
It was time to see.	Nunc videre erat.
But this is not easy.	Sed hoc non est facile.
But who will do it?	Sed quis facturus est.
We don't like it.	Non placet nobis.
And yet it is.	Et tamen est.
I want to go home now please	Nunc domum ire volo quaeso
It was too good.	Erat nimium bene.
I can't see what you need	Non possum videre quid opus sit
I really like the one	Ego vere amo unum
I don't like it very much	Ego autem non placet valde
Which is true.	Quod verum est.
I don't want to come here again.	Nolo hic iterum venire.
I probably knew nothing	Probabiliter nihil sciebam
I saw myself in you	Vidi ipse in te
I need to talk to my dad	Mihi opus est loqui ad me Pater
I was told to give up on it	Dictum est mihi dare usque in eam
But it was from none.	Sed a nulla erat.
Must have.	Habere debet.
I don't like this longer	Non placet hic diutius
But he came.	Sed venit.
This week will be better.	Hoc septimana melius erit.
I won't be hard at it	Ego non esse difficile ad eam
Now let me say something.	Nunc aliquid dicam.
I knew exactly what it was	Prorsus sciebam quid esset
To somebody to do so.	Ut quis id.
Please need your help	Quaeso auxilium tuum opus
I'm sorry to do	Me paenitet facere
If you need it.	Si opus sit.
I'm hurting	Me malum facere
Again he asked.	Iterum rogavit.
I know you do	Scio te facere
I can do a lot of this	Ego multum hoc facere potest
I wonder who did it	Miror quis fecerit
I don't need anything	Non opus est aliquid
I'll tell you why.	Dicam quare.
It was a way to get advice.	Ad consilium erat quomodo.
I won't be like that again	Et non erit similis ut iterum
And it was something else.	Erat autem aliud.
Everyone always seems to know.	Semper omnes scire videtur.
By this also I was.	per hoc quoque fui.
I know exactly where it is.	Prorsus scio ubi sit.
I need to know if this is true	Mihi opus est scire, si hoc verum est
I just don't do this anymore	Modo non hoc amplius
i think you owe it	Puto quod debes
I will definitely talk to him.	Certus sum loqui ad eum.
I want to see it before doing it	Volo videre ante eam facit
But at last he is here.	Sed tandem hic est.
It is not possible, it is not possible.	Non potest, non potest.
I hope you are too.	Spero te quoque.
I know him pretty	Scio eum satis
I just think	Modo quid cogitat
I think until yesterday morning	Puto ad heri mane
Just work from day to day.	Iustus opus de die in diem.
There was nothing else	Nihil aliud fuit
All I think is true	Omnes verum puto
But it was not the same.	Sed non ipsum erat.
This was good.	Hoc erat bonum.
I can't deal with it now	Non possum agere cum eo nunc
I have nothing like that	Habeo nihil simile quod
I have never been like him before.	Numquam ante eum similis.
Something like that happened last week.	Aliquid simile quod proxima septimana factum est.
Evil, indeed.	Malum, vere.
Okay this too.	Bene haec quoque.
I would never do this job	Ut numquam hoc officium
I know you want to see me.	Scio me vis videre.
I need to feel real	Opus est ut verum sentio
It was too much for him.	Nimium erat ei.
But not me.	Sed ne me.
I can't anymore.	Non possum amplius.
This has been said to me.	Hoc mihi dictum est.
But how good is it.	Sed quam bonum est.
Maybe that was before.	Aliquam id erat ante.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
I forgot all about it here	Oblitus essem hic omnia de eo
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
I would probably too.	Probabiliter etiam vellem.
I really want to see	Ego vere vis videre
I know already.	Scio jam.
But it is the same.	Idem tamen est.
I need to go see	Ire debeo videre
This is what it is.	Hoc quid est.
I know where you are doing	Scio ubi tu facis
It's certainly not in me.	Non est certe in mea.
I really wanted something to believe in	Ego vere voluit aliquid credere in
I have everything to say.	Habeo omnibus dicere.
We can do all things together.	Omnia simul facere possumus.
But that is before.	Sed id est ante.
I also know what's happened to you	Scio etiam quid tibi acciderit
I'm here to go to school.	Me huc ad scholam ire.
I could not think like	Non potui cogitare sicut
You'll never want him to be again.	Numquam vis eum iterum esse.
It is true.	Verum est.
Never stop loving you	Numquam prohibere vos
But not before.	Sed non ante.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
I didn't want to go	Nolui ire
It is easy to see how this can be done.	Quod quomodo fieri possit, facile est videre.
It's not going to happen.	Non futurum est.
I didn't see how he thought	Non vidi quomodo hoc consilium putabat
I don't think this is true	Non puto hoc verum est
Three are not the same.	Tres non sunt idem.
I knew it was hard	Sciebam eum esse difficile
This is absolutely nothing.	Hoc omnino nihil est.
I'll do it tomorrow.	Cras id faciam.
He was very good to me.	Mihi valde bonus erat.
I know you want to see	Scio te velle videre
He knows we're doing nothing wrong.	Ille scit nos nihil mali facere.
I just want to be more	Non solum vis esse amplius
I'm glad you did this	Gaudeo quod fecisti hic
He was not.	Non erat.
and only her.	et solus eam.
tell me what you need.	dic mihi quid opus sit.
She was so happy.	Ita felix fuit.
There was a need to get things done.	Ubi ad opus erat res sunt.
I'm not sure about any of this	Non certus sum de aliquo hoc
We're here to help you.	Hic sumus ut adiuvet te.
But somehow.	Sed nescio quo modo.
Certainly, please.	Certe, velit.
I told him to discuss	Dixi ei ut de
Hardly him.	Vix ipsum.
I want to do everything	Volo facere omnia
I need it tonight	Mihi opus est hac nocte
You have work with us.	Opus habes nobiscum.
Not well.	Non bene.
And this was done.	Quod et factum est.
Probably not much.	Probabiliter non multum.
He looks at his book.	Librum suum spectat.
I don't think you'd like to do	Non videtur quod velis facere
I hope you don't know	Spero nescire
I just can't get another time.	Modo non potest aliud tempore.
I feel ut	Sentio ut
You want money.	Pecuniam tibi vis.
I know it will be difficult	Scio erit difficile
A good family is a good family	Bonum genus est bonum genus
I didn't know anyone here	Ego nesciebam quis hic
it was not a day to do today.	dies non erat hodie facere.
I didn't know if this is possible	Ego nesciebam si hoc fieri potest
Nothing to do with my job.	Nihil ad officium meum.
I hope you have.	Spero te habere.
I think we're just friends	Puto nos iustus esse amicos
There is no question.	Quaestio non est.
I know you very well.	Novi nimis bene.
So very well.	Sic optime.
It's almost time to go.	Fere tempus est proficisci.
The boy does not.	Puer non facit.
I think they will be here already	Puto fore iam hic
I really wanted to talk to her	Ego vere volui loqui ad eam
If you want, you can say nothing at all.	Si vis, nihil omnino dicere potes.
I knew it would be morning	Sciebam fore mane
Maybe it was great.	Aliquam erat magna.
Yes, he was in him, but he always wanted to.	Etiam in erat ipsum, sed semper velit.
He knew that.	Sciebat.
They are not easy.	Non sunt facile.
I hope it's not tonight"	Spero nocte non est "
Not me exactly.	Non me prorsus.
not better than that.	Non melius quam.
to make money.	Pecuniam facere.
It seemed easy.	Facile videbatur.
I could hardly speak.	Vix loqui potui.
I had him	Ego habui eo
This is what he says.	Hoc est quod dicit.
I don't want this at all	Hoc omnino non volo
And he is not here.	Et non est hic.
I was never at home like this, well, not always	domi numquam sic fui, bene, non semper
Maybe that's been said before.	Aliquam id dictum ante.
I could go see	Non potui ire videre
never knew who it was.	numquam scivit quis esset.
I want to surprise you.	Miror te volo.
This is certainly better.	Hoc certe melius est.
I need something	Mihi opus erat aliquid
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
That is to say.	Id est loqui.
This is nothing like that	Hoc est nihil simile quod
She didn't want to.	Illa nolebat.
I am definitely going to get there.	Certus sum ire illuc.
I couldn't believe anyone here	Non potui credere quis hic
It seemed to go very long	Valde diu videbatur ire per
I knew what to do	Sciebam quid faciendum esset
There is none.	Ibi non est.
I like to say what to do	Mihi placet dicere quid facere
I don't like you dog	Non amo te, canis
I wonder if anyone really could	Miror si quis vere posset
I hope not too hard for you	Spero non tibi difficile
I'm not even glad.	Ne ego quidem gaudeo.
But this was not done.	Sed hoc non est factum.
I just want to hear it	Ego iustus volo audire illud
I can't do anything to help her	Non possum facere quicquam ad auxilium eius
I thought you know who this is	Cogitavi te scire qui hoc
I know you well	Scio te bene
She thought he could do it.	Putavit se facere posse.
It's never going to happen.	Numquam futurum est.
I'm not sure about it	Non sum certus de illo
I haven't even heard it	Ego ne illud quidem audivi
For the last time should be even longer.	Tempus enim tandem debet esse etiam diutius.
I couldn't live without trying	Non potui vivere non conatur
me something to buy me	Mihi aliquid emere me
I need your help if you want help	Mihi opus est tibi auxilium, si vis auxilium
I have to find some way to get to it	Habeo invenire aliquo modo ut ad eum

I couldn't think of anything	Non potui cogitare aliquid
He was not going to do this.	Non erat facturus hoc.
Don't do this to me anymore.	Hoc mihi iam noli facere.
I didn't know you were here	Ego nesciebam hic es
I couldn't even have time to think about it.	Ne tempus quidem de eo cogitare potui.
This may well be done.	Hoc bene fieri potest.
He could not be more than thirty.	Non potuit plus quam triginta esse.
I've never done it before.	Nunquam ante feci.
I thought everything was going well with him.	Omnia de eo bene fieri putavi.
It is not always necessary.	Non semper necesse est.

This cannot be good.	Hoc bonum esse non potest.

She was lucky in this way.	Et hoc modo felix fuit.
He did that to her.	Faceret ut eam.
I do nothing.	Nihil facio.
He could not do it any longer.	Iam facere non potuit.
Do all you can.	Fac per omnia potes.
It is mine.	Mea est.

This should not be done.	Hoc fieri non debet.
But some now and none at all.	Sed aliquam nunc nec nulla.

I don't know where the money is	Nescio ubi pecuniam
I need him to be there	Mihi opus est ei ibi esse
It never is.	Numquam est.
But as was said.	Sed ut dictum erat.
wanted to do	Voluit facere
And he did not tell it.	Et non indicavit.

It is between you and him.	Est inter te et illum.
I have something to do	Habeo aliquid ipsum facere
Do better.	Melius fac.
I can't do it tonight	Hac nocte non possum facere
That was what he wanted.	Quod erat quod voluit.
Yes, that's a great idea.	Etiam id dictum magna.
He didn't want to talk about it either.	De hoc vel loqui noluit.
I never thought	Numquam putavi
I already said too	Iam dixi nimis
I think it's good	Puto esse bonum
He did nothing.	Nihil id fecit.
But that cannot be without it.	Illud autem sine illo esse non potest.
Maybe not a lot.	Fortasse non multum.
Yes i'm a guy.	Ita sum in guy.
he already knew.	iam sciebat.
To be able to do so.	Posse facere.
I guess they are not	Suspicor non sunt
For a long time.	Multo tempore.
I hope you like it.	Spero tibi placet.
I was sure about this	Certus eram de hoc
Well, well, he thinks.	Bene, bene, cogitat.

I thought to help you	Cogitavi ut adiuvet te
It is indeed.	Est quidem.
I just can't do anything about it	Ego iustus non potest aliquid de illo
I'll always have all I need	Ego tibi semper omnes opus
Much better.	Multo etiam melius.
i think he just never knows what to say	Puto se iustus numquam scit quid dicam
And he did not.	Et non fecit.
No one knows what time is.	Nemo scit quid tempus sit.
That is possible.	Quod fieri potest.
I just like to think	Ego iustus amo illum cogitare
Not that day.	Non illa.

This is just gone.	Hoc modo abiit.
Play the video now to find out.	Nunc ut video ludere ex invenire.
I tried to understand	Conatus sum intelligere
I wish I saw him.	Volo eum vidi.
Usually, he says what he says.	Fere ita dicit quod dicit.
Don't be here with him	Ne hic cum eo
I don't have anything.	Non habeo quod.
All you need is	Omnibus opus est.
That is not true today.	Quod hodie verum non est.
I can't get it yet	Non possum accipere eum adhuc
Both of these.	Utrumque.
Who knows if it is possible.	Quis scit si fieri potest.
Which can be both good and evil.	Quod et bonum et malum esse potest.
I have nothing on it	Ego nihil ex eo
Don't you?	Nonne?.
I don't know.	Non novi.
I don't feel for him	Non sentio ad illum
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
I don't doubt	Nec dubito
I know where to get all things	Scio ubi ad omnes res
Not something but it is there	Non aliquid sed sit ibi
I don't really listen	Non vere audire
That has to be enough.	Quod satis esse habet.
He didn't want to talk about it now.	Noluit loqui de hoc nunc.
It is good.	Bonum est.
Nothing new till today	Nihil novi usque hodie
Maybe but some before.	Aliquam sed aliquam ante.
I don't regret that	Non paenitet quod
It was late for lunch.	Sero ad prandium erat.
It was busy.	Fuit occupatus.
I didn't know her name	Ego nesciebam nomen eius
It is more than that.	Plus est quam illud.
It's pretty good.	Satis est bonum.
Say it again.	Dic iterum.
I have said this.	hoc dixi.
I said I don't like it there	Dixi tibi non placet ibi
This father could not be alone.	Pater hic solus esse non potuit.
I have seen you.	Vidi te.
If you have anything, who wants.	Si aliquid habes, quis velit.
He doesn't have anything else.	Non habet aliud.
I will do something per se	Ego autem per se aliquid
You know where.	Scis in.
I could do this all day	Hoc facere potui totum diem
But I didn't want to know.	Verum me scire nolui.
I knew exactly what this meant	Sciebam prorsus quid hoc esset
I can't get out of this late	Non possum non ex hoc nuper
I know only what people are up to me	Scio nisi quod homines ad me
I did that soon and I'm happy for it	Ego feci quod mox et pro eo gaudeo
I didn't know really bad so bad	Ego nesciebam vere malum tam malum
I was pretty sure you	Satis certo essem vobis
I'm quite busy traveling	Sum satis occupatus iter
He could not hear.	Audire non potuit.
Whether you want to be with you.	Utrum vis esse ad vos.
Not even that.	Ne illud quidem.
Nothing could be said of him.	Nihil potuit de illo.
I don't need to say anything	Non opus est tibi dicere aliquid
But you can stop him.	Sed potes eum prohibere.
This he did.	Hoc fecit.
We need your help.	Auxilium tuum nobis opus est.
It does not please.	Non placet.
I know her better than anyone	Scio eam melius quam quis
Here they are!	Hic sunt!.
this was his plan.	id ei consilium fuit.
I didn't think I was going to do it.	Non putabam me facturum esse.
Well, forgot.	Bene, oblitus.
No, not said before.	Nulla nec dictum ante.
Thus it was.	Sic fuit.
I like both of you	Ego amo utrumque
I could go for lunch before lunch	Prandium prandium ante potui ire
I saw him, but could not stop him.	Vidi eum, sed non potuit eum prohibere.
I didn't want to think too long in that	Nolui cogitare nimium diu in illo
There seems to be no need.	Nihil opus esse videtur.
I need to do it first	Mihi opus est ut faciam illud primum
But that's how it was said.	Sed id dictum quam.
He knew this well enough.	Quod satis sciebat.
I don't even see him coming	Non etiam videre eum venire
But now tell me.	Sed nunc dic mihi.
No one is in it.	Nemo eam in.
These things are not all about you.	Haec de te non sunt omnia.
Now you are thinking.	Iam non cogitas.
I didn't know what this meant.	Nesciebam quid hoc esset.
We can't go on like this.	Non possumus sic ire.
For that is true.	Id enim verum est.
Get the first apple	Ut primum malum
But I got lucky.	Sed obtinuit felix.
Even not to some extent.	Etiam non aliquam.
He is a good guy.	Bonus est guy.
There is no time for that.	Nulla id tempus est.
I tried to think what this is	Conatus sum cogitare quid sit hoc
I was a little while ago.	paulo ante tempus fui.
I will do more than that.	Plus faciam quam illud.
I think it was said.	Dictum puto.
It is so hard to think rightly.	Tam difficile est recte cogitare.
This is way better.	Hoc modo melius est.
Something to do at last.	Aliquid facere tandem.
When this was done for the first time.	Quod cum primum factum est.
That's what you want.	Id velis.
I know what this means to you	Scio quid hoc sit tibi
You can do nothing.	Nihil potes.
I thought something about doing something like this	Non cogitavi aliquid de facere aliquid simile hoc
I did not.	Non feci.
I highly doubt	Valde dubito
I was with him.	cum eo fui.
It is what it is.	Est quid est.
I like this.	Hoc mihi placet.
This means not working.	Hoc modo non est opus.
not very good.	Non ipsum bonum.
I told him what happened	Dixi ei quod factum est
That is very good.	Quod valde bonum est.
I guess not too much	Suspicor non nimis
I could not love you	Non potui vos
How to do?	Quam facere?.
They are not bad at all.	Non sunt omnino mali.
And the father before him.	Et pater ante ipsum.
Totally out okay.	Prorsus ex bene.
I know what she's up to	Scio quid illa usque ad
What was that.	Quid erat illud.
His wife?.	Suam uxorem ?.
Not easy to believe	Non facile credere
You can do so.	Ita facere potes.
I know he loves me so much.	Scio quod tantum me amet.
I'm here to stay with you	Ego hic mane apud te
There is no time.	Nulla tempus.
The situation is so, and yet there is something else.	Res ita se habet, et tamen est aliquid amplius.
I hope at least not you.	Spero certe non te.
I will be here tomorrow	Ego hic cras
I have been through this as well	Per hoc quoque fui
I've always heard you.	Ego te semper audivi.
This is the guy I need.	Hoc est guy opus est.
He was not yet ready to speak with him.	Loqui cum eo nondum paratus erat.
But it is not the same.	Sed nec ipsum est.
The same work to be done.	Idem opus faciendum.
Things aren't what it used to be.	Res non sunt quod esse solebat.
I just want to do what you do.	Ego iustus volo fac ut facias.
I've heard my name	Audivi nomen meum
really, really good.	vere, vere bonum.
I hope better this way	Spero melius hoc modo
No more than that now.	Nulla id nunc quam.
she said.	illa dixit.
I really like talking to you	Ego vere amo loquitur tecum
I appreciate everything you've done for me	Ego valde bene omnia fecisti mihi
but I could learn.	scire potui, sed.
He would do his best to do so.	Suum id optime facturum.
I thought it would be me.	Putabam me fore.
I will post it	Ego post eam
I can't see the future.	in futurum videre non possum.
He was not.	Non erat.
First he said.	Primum dixit.
I have to tell him	Habeo dicere ei
I knew it would happen, but	Scivi futurum, sed
I can go for it.	Pro ire possum.
what i had to do with it	Quid faciam cum illo habui
It would seem that it is not.	Videtur quod non.
There was so much, he wanted to say this.	Tantum erat, hoc dicere voluit.
It is.	Est.
sorry for what just happened	Paenitet me quod sicut factum est
He wants to do something.	Velit aliquid et.
I can do my lunch too	Prandium meum possum facere, quoque
But not even now.	Sed nec ipsum nunc.
There is more money in it.	Plus pecuniae in eo est.
I can't say what this time is	Non possum dicere quid hoc tempus sit
So he was after all.	Sic ille post omnes fuit.
i want something.	rem volo.
Always from him.	Semper ex eo.
I have it for sure.	Pro certo habeo.
I just don't talk about it	Ego iustus non loqui de illo
what had to be done.	Quid sibi faciendum esset.
Perhaps the first time.	Primum fortasse.
Looks like what's happened.	Simile quid acciderit.
He didn't want to do that.	Noluit facere.
This will always be.	Hoc semper erit.
I do the same with people	Facio simile apud homines
I feel lucky to have just one	Sentio felix habere sicut unum
So there is no such thing.	Ita res nulla est.
I want a lot	Volo multum
But it was not so.	Sed non sic erat.
All men.	Omnes homines.
Okay, maybe now.	Bene fortasse nunc.
But that's none at all.	Sed id nulla nulla.
But that was enough for me.	Sed id mihi satis fuit.
I know what I need	Scio quid opus sit
I think it really is gone.	Puto vere abiit.
All before me.	Omnes ante me.
What for indeed.	Quid pro quidem.
I never wanted from him	Numquam volui ex eo
I really didn't know	Ego vere nesciebat
I would like to see.	Videre vellem.
But I never did it.	Sed non numquam eius.
And we do it all along.	Et nobis id per omnia.
I am without a job.	Sine officium sum.
You can be me	Potes me esse
I'm never going to be with him.	Im 'nunquam futurum est cum illo.
yes no out of no	Etiam nulla ex nulla.
If you got lucky.	Si obtinuit felix.
And after that.	Et post illud.
I just wonder what is up to you	Ego iustus miror quod est ad vos
I'm glad that	Gaudeo quod
never do	Nunquam facere
There's not a lot of work to be done.	Non multum opus est ibi fieri.
But it is nothing.	Sed nihil est.
i think i just want to talk	Puto tantum velle loqui
To get you on time.	Ut te ad tempus.
Or at least it began.	Vel certe incepit.
But she wants out.	Sed et velit ex.
I could not	Non potui
And he had.	Et habuit.
I could not be seen enough.	Non potui satis videri.
Never from us.	Numquam a nobis.
To you.	Ut te.
She could say yes.	Posset etiam dicere.
I can't go back again.	Iterum ire non possum.
So now he's with us.	Ita nunc est nobiscum.
I was a child, but I knew what had happened	Puer eram, sed sciebam quid factum esset
Not sure exactly what it was yet	Non certus quod prorsus erat adhuc
As always, probably.	Ut semper, probabiliter.
I do everything for him and it doesn't do me well	Facio omnia ei et non bene me
I never saw who it was.	Numquam vidit quis esset.
But I don't like you.	Sed non placet tibi.
i don't know why.	nescio cur.
This may work.	Hoc ut opus.
That was not.	Quod non fuit.
I don't want to have something to do with someone	Non vis habere aliquid facere cum aliquo
There he said.	ibi dixit.
To that.	Ad illud.
I could not say if I was still	Non potui dicere si adhuc esset
I don't want the whole thing	Nolo totum
I know it's hard to hear	Scio suus 'difficile audire
You are not with me.	Non es mecum.
The thing is, it will not.	Res est, non vult.
Never see you again	Numquam te videre amplius
I thought of going home	Cogitavi domum
He was never here.	Numquam hic erat.
We can do all that we have.	Omnia possumus, quae habemus.
I'm sorry for what has happened	Paenitet me quod hoc factum est
I don't know if she really loves me.	Nescio an vere me amat.
I thought so happy	Cogitavi tam felix
I only get one day at a time	Modo ut unus dies ad tempus
I was ready	Paratus eram
Still well and on time.	Adhuc bene et in tempore.
I don't know whether it is good or bad.	Nescio an bonum an malum sit.
I will not do that again	Quod iterum non facturus
When he was there, he knew.	Cum esset, sciebat.
I could not stay here	Hic non potui manere
I hope to hear from you.	Spero a te audire.
I have a little more	Habeo paulo plus
I just wanted to do what it was	EGO iustus volo fac quod erat
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
I knew you'd like to thank	Sciebam velis agere
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
But this seemed very probable.	Sed id nimis probabile videbatur.
Do it quickly.	Fac cito.
That's how very happy it is.	Ut sit amet ipsum quam.
It's not enough to do.	Non satis est facere.
None of this except that.	Nulla id nisi quam.
Maybe not, she thought.	Fortasse non est, putavit.
I hope you can see that	Spero te videre potes quod
But the problem is getting people who can do the job.	Sed quaestio est questus qui potest facere officium.
I want to say that it really is not true at all	Dicere volo, quod vere omnino non est verum
I wanted to see, but I could not	Videre volui, sed non potui
Not much.	Non multum.
I am the one behind it	Ego sum unus post illud
I need you to help me there.	Non opus est tibi ut me adiuvet ibi.
I knew there was someone who could help me	Sciebam esse aliquem qui me adiuvet
I just want you to feel bad for me	EGO iustus volo vos sentio malum pro me
This I know for sure.	Hoc certe scio.
I am working here.	Hic sum opus.
Great too.	Magna etiam.
And there it was true	Et ibi verum erat
She is at home.	Domi est.
This was very good.	Hoc erat ipsum bonum.
This is a great question.	Magna quaestio haec est.
That's great.	Ut id magna.
It will be a great night.	Nocte magna erit.
And all is well.	Et bene omnia sunt.
I wish you had more time	Utinam plus temporis
I don't want to see you.	Nolo te videre.
Everything I owe you	Omnia debeo tibi
Not for him	Non pro eo
I was ready	Paratus eram
There was something more.	Plus aliquid fuit.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
That's just my little thing in it.	Id solum meus parum est in eo.
I just can't speak for me now	Modo possum dicere pro me nunc
I need it now	Mihi opus eius nunc
I told him the truth.	Dixi ei verum.
I don't mean to you.	Non sit tibi.
I just know what you're like	Ego iustus scio quid simile es
I know you're too late.	Novi te nimis sero.
And this he does not speak well of him.	Quod quidem de illo non bene loquitur.
He could be sent to her.	Posset ad eam.
It was a little before three in the morning.	Paulo ante tres mane fuit.
I have what you want	Habeo quod vis
i knew better than	Scivi melius quam
No one wants to cum.	Nulla velit ut cum.
I am really trying to understand	Ego sum vere intelligere conatur
I was ready to do it before	Paratus eram nobis facere ante
I thought I would trust him	Putavi fore credere quod ei
I want to find a really great deal soon	Volo invenire vere multum primum
But not from him.	Sed non ex ipsum.
That's where my problem comes in.	Ubi id est, mea quaestio venit in.
I know it is possible	Scio fieri potest
I had a very good time	Ego quoque ipsum tempus bonum
Yes they are.	Ita sunt.
There was something about it.	Fuisse aliquid de eo.
I knew this would happen.	Sciebam fore.
Completely satis-	Omnino satis-
not her.	Non eam.
But something more.	Sed plus aliquid.
I can't believe you can't tell us	Credere non possum non dicere nobis
I was ready dad	Paratus eram pater
You don't have.	Non habes.
Yes, yes.	Etiam, ipsum.
I know he wants to have you	Scio se velle te habere
I'm here now.	Hic nunc sum.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Aliquam non velit.
But he could have easily done so.	Sed facile potuit.
I didn't know what to say.	Quid dicam nesciebam.
I do not have.	Non habeo.
I am getting this sick	Hoc male questus sum
He was not so happy.	Non tam felix erat.
Evil is evil.	Malum est malum.
This is not what you want to know	Hoc non vis scire
I didn't know this	Haec ego nesciebam
And I'll tell you something.	Dicam autem vobis aliquid.
yes it is not said.	Etiam non dictum est.
I really wanted to help	Ego vere voluit ad auxilium
Or perhaps not.	Vel fortasse non.
This is to do.	Hoc est facere.
It's been a good day.	Suus 'bonus dies fuit.
I'm afraid	Vereor ne
But no one said anything.	Sed quis dictum nulla.
It is a difficult thing to go through.	Res difficile est ire per.
And he indeed was not.	Et ille quidem non erat.
That was something else.	Aliud erat id.
My father is there.	Pater meus ibi est.
I know what you mean to be happy.	Scio quod vis felix esse.
I have enough time to listen	Habeo tempus satis audire
I didn't want to see	Nolui videre
We can't help this.	Hoc adiuvare non possumus.
I am more than what it is to be	Ego plus quam quod est esse
You don't have to do this.	Hoc facere non habes.
Yes it is true.	Ita verum est.
I don't need to see it.	Hoc non opus est videre.
I could not understand it	Non potui intelligere eam
I hope to stay there	Spero quod ibi mane
None of this except for some.	Nulla id aliquam nisi.
He wasn't sure if she could do both at the same time.	Non erat certus si utrumque simul posset facere.
I see what you did	Video quid fecerit
I didn't want to know more	Nolui scire amplius
I saw him here only one time	Eum hic solum vidi unum tempus
It is not so.	Non ita est.
He could not leave her.	Non potuit eam relinquere.
I'm going through this	Ego ire per hoc
I am there for something to do.	Ego sum ibi aliquid facere.
I need to talk to you	Mihi opus est loqui tecum
But there no one knows him	Sed ibi nemo eum novit
I can still hear it now	Non possum adhuc audire eam nunc
This is the way to go.	Hoc sit iter.
I have seen you.	Vidi te.
I just need something else, something else	Ego iustus opus aliquid aliud, aliud aliquid
Certainly not.	Certe non.
in this week if all goes well.	In hac septimana, si bene.
I am getting better	Questus sum melius
You don't have anything or	Non te aliquid vel
It's about you.	Hoc est de te.
And you know what.	Et tu quid scis.
I was not here to come home	Non eram huc venire domum
All for him.	Omnes pro eo.
What are you.	Quid tu.
There is no need to say why	Non opus est dicere quare
Maybe he wanted to do a lot of things.	Voluit fortasse facere multum.
I could not do that.	Non me potuit, ut.
But it was not either.	Sed vel non erat.
I am, and this is true	Ego sum, et hoc verum est
I didn't know what happened recently	Nesciebam quid nuper factum est
i never saw.	numquam vidi.
But the job has not been done.	Sed officium non est factum.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Look here.	Hic, vide.
But he is already speaking.	Sed iam loquitur.
I can't really talk now	Non possum vere loqui nunc
Which is not true.	Quod non est verum.
Yes it is what it is.	Ita est quid est.
I hope you will like it	Spero fore ut placet
I don't know what's there.	Nescio an quid ibi sit.
That's a good thing.	Ut bene rem.
I could not say if I could see	Non potui dicere, si me videre potuit
I was not, so it was	Non eram, sic erat
I don't see why you want to.	Non video cur vis.
I hope all is well for dinner	Spero omnes bene prandium
I don't know which one is better.	Nescio quo melius est.
I need it	Eum mihi opus est
I can't say that	Non possum dicere quod
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
it was not enough.	parum erat.
I don't see what	Non vide quid
I.	Et ego.
I'm not happy.	Non gaudeo.
I could not get to him	Ad eum non potui
I feel something behind me now	Sentio aliquid post me nunc
I want it here now	Volo eam hic nunc
I want you to find something to do	Volo te invenire eam aliquid facere
You can't do it.	Facere non potes.
I don't know what it was.	Nescio quid esset.
Not after three years	Non post tres annos
And there we have it.	Et ibi habemus eam.
I want you to understand both.	Volo te utrumque intelligere.
Never listen to anyone	Numquam quis audire
Let us do so.	Fac nos sic.
They're still there.	Sunt adhuc ibi.
They are not like my father.	Non sunt sicut pater meus.
I don't want to think this way	Nolo hoc modo cogitare
I knew he was with us	Sciebam nobiscum erat
You have done really well.	Vere bene fecisti.
I did that too.	Feci id quoque.
you have enough time.	satis temporis habes.
It's too good.	Nimis bonus est.
I want to tell you what really happened	Volo tibi dicere quod vere factum est
Not much, but enough.	Non multum, sed satis.
Better for us	Melius nobis
That can be.	Illud potest esse.
forgot it.	Oblitus est.
Talk about it.	Id loqui.
I can't find this.	Hoc invenire non possum.
I don't know you here	Hic non novi vos
I'll buy lunch	Ego tibi emere prandium
i think she loves it	Puto amat eam
I was very late tonight	Essem ipsum sero hac nocte
No no no.	Nulla non nulla.
Well said something to him.	Bene aliquid dixit ei.
she said.	illa dixit.
He is not like today.	Ipse hodie non est similis.
You never know.	Numquam tu.
I could buy	Non potui emere
I hope to leave	Spero me relinquere
I know everything you say	Scio omnia tibi dicere
I wonder if anyone can help	Miror si quis potest adiuvare
But it was not going to happen.	Sed non erat futurum.
I will definitely make it to you	Ego certus eam ad vos
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
That's what I did.	Id feci.
He didn't say anything to me	Nec mihi aliquid dixit
I thought like you	Cogitavi sicut tu
I thought I was doing well.	Putavi bene facere.
Not from whom you are.	Non ex quo sis.
I could not believe	Non potui credere
What was there here?	Quid ibi hic esset.
Maybe it wasn't but it was.	Aliquam non nisi erat.
But I will do it.	Sed id faciam.
You don't have breakfast this morning	Non habes prandium hoc mane
I never thought of this	Numquam cogitavi hoc
I am almost tense now	Ego fere tempus nunc
He has no time.	Tempus non habet.
I thought better	Putavi melius
I have something for you	Habeo aliquid tibi
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
It certainly did for me	Hoc certe fecit mihi
Well, not after.	Bene, non post.
It can be difficult.	Non potest esse difficile.
Maybe you just couldn't do it.	Forsitan iustus facere non posse.
Thus he had.	Ita habuit.
That was enough to know.	Quod satis erat scire.
So he gave me your book.	Ita mihi librum tuum dedit.
As it was.	Ut erat.
To be honest he was.	Ut sit amet enim erat.
I thought it was someone	Cogitavi esse aliquem
No time either.	Vel tempus nulla.
if, if, if.	si, si, si.
It will be good for him.	Bonum ei erit.
Looks like he'll be fine.	Similis ille erit bene.
I have a name you know	Nomen habeo, tu scis
That is, it was really different.	Id est, aliud vere fuit.
i never did it.	numquam id feci.
Say what you want.	Dic quid vis.
But what?.	Sed quid?.
I've never seen it before	Ego numquam id ante
The father said so to him.	Pater ei ita dixit.
Everything.	Omnia.
I want what you have	Volo quod habes
Again, it is not seen.	Iterum, non videtur.
If you don't like it, that's fine.	Si non placet, Bene.
I forgot about everything today	Oblitus sum de omnibus hodie
This could be done.	Hoc fieri potuit.
I can give more	Non possum plus dare
Which he did not understand.	Quod non intellexit.
I could go to my room alone	Non potui ire in cubiculum meum solum
I just know me very well	Ego iustus nimis bene novi me
Never live again	Numquam iterum vivere
She does a good job.	Et bene facit officium.
I will if you want	Ego, si vis
But I couldn't do anything for the job.	Sed non aliquid facere potuit ad officium.
Not even that.	Ne id quidem.
I believe it can be done, but it seems very unlikely	Fieri posse credo, sed valde probabile videtur
There is much more to talk about.	Multo plus est loqui.
Who knows if something will happen.	Qui scit si quid erit.
i thought he would never talk to me	Putabam se nunquam loqui ad me
I think it's time for me to be here	Puto me tempus hic fieri
But it is great.	Sed est magna.
Of something.	De aliquo.
I don't get anything from you	Ego non quod a te
This is in itself and not much.	Hoc in se et non est multum.
I know what happened	Scio quid factum sit
He doesn't want us to like it	Non vult ad nos sicut illud
She's certainly not good enough for you.	Illa certe tibi non satis fuit.
I don't think or feel	Non puto nec sentio
It is something more.	Plus aliquid est.
I want to leave something behind.	Volo aliquid post relinquere.
I want to deal with him	Volo agere cum illo
I could not do both	Non potui utrumque
I know you have a lot to do	Scio te multum agere
No that's none of it.	Nulla id nulla ex.
But you said nothing.	Sed nihil dixisti.
I wanted something new	Volui aliquid novi
I love you.	Te amo.
I wanted everything to go well	Volui omnia ut bene
Even before that same thing.	Etiam id ipsum ante.
I don't want to do poorly again	Non vult facere male iterum
I like you.	Placet tibi.
I really don't.	Ego vere facio.
He is gone now.	Abiit nunc.
I know everything is okay	Scio quae est bene
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
That is not true.	Quod non est.
I forgot to tell you	Oblitus sum tibi dicere
I wonder if this is possible.	Miror si hoc fieri potest.
I have heard this to be true.	Audivi hoc verum esse.
I really don't know you	Ego vere non vos
I don't really think about.	Non vere cogitare de.
Why? 	Quare?
Well, it's entirely different.	Bene, omnino aliud est.
And it is possible.	Et fieri potest.
This afternoon they are yours.	Haec post meridiem tua sunt.
But this by.	Sed hoc per.
I couldn't do anything	Non potui facere quicquam
I thought maybe something	Putavi fortasse aliquid
he knows me so well.	ita me bene novit.
Say something between you and me.	Dic aliquid, inter me et te.
This he did not understand.	Hoc non intellexit.
Thus it was.	Sic fuit.
I wanted to know what happened to him	Volui scire quid in eo acciderit
I am ready.	paratus sum.
Hard day by day.	Per diem difficile.
I tried to see you	Conatus sum ad vos
This is for me.	Hoc mihi est.
It would seem that	Videtur quod .
This has been said.	Hoc dictum est.
I need to get away from it	Mihi opus est ut ab eius
I know I love you there	Scio te amo ibi
I saw the time	Vidi tempore
I only know what is true	Tantum scio quod verum sit
But that was before.	Sed id erat ante.
He has so much to say.	Habet tantum dicere.
It seemed certain.	Certus videbatur.
Hardly just that long	Vix id modo in tempore
i thought it was pretty good.	Putabam satis bene factum.
I want to be with you all	Volo tecum esse cum omnibus vobis
I really don't listen to him	Ego vere non audire eum
I need you to stay here.	Te hic manere debeo.
Not what has been done.	Non quod factum est.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
But it was not before.	Sed non ante erat.
In the house	In domum.
I just want to be certain	Ego iustus volo esse certum
I couldn't believe what happened	Non potui credere quod factum est
No, I don't like it.	Non, non placet.
I want to feel it again	Volo sentio iterum
I need to know I don't do it	Opus est scire non faciam illud
What nationality I love	Quod genus amo
Do that now.	Fac ut nunc.
Do it too.	Fac etiam.
I owe a lot of	Debeo multum
You don't have to go.	Ad te non ire.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
He is there.	Is ibi est.
It was a good thing.	Res erat bona.
You can stay here.	Hic manere potes.
It could be her husband.	Non potuit vir suus esse.
He never was.	Numquam erat.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
Well we have time.	Bene habemus tempus.
I know one too.	Novi unum quoque.
As you said.	Sicut dixisti.
I wish I could see you here	Utinam hic videre
He could do nothing else.	Potuit aliud.
But that was none.	Sed id erat nulla.
How this was done.	Quomodo hoc factum est.
I just want to talk to you in the morning	EGO iustus volo loqui tibi de mane
There was none in him.	Nulla in ipsum erat.
He will always be with us	Semper nobiscum erit
I don't know where they are	Nescio ubi sunt
But never before.	Sed numquam ante.
There is also .	Est etiam .
His dad used to play with me.	Pater eius mecum ludere solebat.
I knew exactly what I was going to do	Prorsus sciebam quid facturus esset
It is too much.	Nimis est.
However, we can do better than we can.	Tamen melius facere possumus quod possumus.
To do so.	Ut facerem est.
I told her that	Et non indicavit ei quod
I haven't forgotten	Non sum oblitus es
First	Primum.
I can't think of a time I haven't been	Non possum cogitare de tempore non fuit
It is important for anyone to be great.	Aliquam sit amet magna quis ex.
I don't really believe in it	Non vere credere eam
So perhaps we can do it here.	Ita fortasse hic facere possumus.
never been and never will be	numquam fuit et numquam erit
You don't want me to be here.	Hic me esse non vis.
I don't see how it can be done	Non video quomodo fieri possit
There's nothing here about you.	Nihil hic de te est.
So it's good.	Sic est bonum.
It's almost great.	Magna fere est.
He wants to talk with us.	Loqui nobiscum vult.
But who can	Sed quis potest.
It's another name.	Est aliud nomen.
Nothing in a year.	Nihil in anno.
So perhaps.	Ita fortasse.
I could not do this myself.	Hoc me facere non potui.
I can't stop thinking about you	Ego potest non prohibere cogitas te
I wish I had never been	Utinam numquam
I wanted something from him	Volui aliquid ab eo
I want to be the same	Volo esse idem
It didn't take long	Hoc non diu
You must do this.	Hoc facere debes.
I'm sorry to hear it	Me paenitet audire eam
I know nothing there.	Nihil ibi novi.
I know how much you mean this too	Scio quantum vis hoc quoque
This was what I needed to think about.	Hoc erat quod opus erat cogitare.
Yes of you.	Etiam a te enim.
Not to you, but to me.	Non tibi, sed mihi.
I like you from me	Ego amo te de me
I want to be right	Volo recte fieri
He would not.	Noluit.
I thought, today is going to be a good day	Cogitavi, hodie futurum esse die enim bona
Both are necessary.	Utrumque opus est.
I could not speak even	Non potui loqui vel
I can see that she got it.	Videre possum, eam obtinuit.
I don't want to stop being with him	Non vis prohibere esse cum eo
But at the same time we can do it.	Sed simul id facere possumus.
I can't believe he told you	Non possum credere dixit tibi
It should be able to be.	Posset esse debet.
The father said.	Pater dixit.
Never do it again	Numquam facere iterum
That was great.	Ut id magna erat.
I don't think this is good.	Hoc bonum esse non puto.
What else am I	Quid aliud sum
I want to do something about it	Volo ut aliquid de illo
I really can't live this way much longer	Ego vere hoc modo multo diutius vivere non potest
But now no one has done it.	Sed nunc nemo id fecit.
I could not do without you	Non potui sine te
I think it was	Ego cogitare erat
It is good for me.	Bonum est mihi.
And what not.	Et quid non.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
The whole thing.	Totum illud.
That's how he played it.	Ut id ipsum quam.
It could be him.	Posset eum esse.
Not a little.	Non parum.
It is time.	Tempus est.
I think that can be done quickly	Puto quod potest fieri cito
I see you do much better	Video te multo melius facere
What about school?' 	Quid de schola?'
he said.	dixit.
I just want to do things that matter to me	Ego iustus volo facere quae rem mihi rem
I only have one and that's enough	Tantum habeo unum et hoc satis est
They are not right.	Non recte sunt.
And they are the same.	Et idem sunt.
I'm trying to do my job	Me conatur facere officium meum
I was not enough.	Parum eram.
She thought it was good to see her.	Putavit eam videre bonum esse.
I have my plan in	Habeo consilium meum in
I just really want you	Ego iustus vere volo te
It's up to you after.	Est tibi, post est.
You cannot understand.	Non potes intelligere.
I don't want to think more	Non vis cogitare amplius
I wanted to have you so badly	Ego te tam male habere volui
She, she, she.	Illa, illa, illa.
Can't think of anything.	Non potest aliquid cogitare.
I just didn't want to think about it	Ego iustus noluit cogitare de illo
I see why my father refused to do this to me	Video cur pater meus hoc mihi noluit
I would like nothing	Vellem nihil
That is not the case now.	Quod iam non sit.
I see the problem	Ego video quaestionem
I could not do it again	Non potui iterum facere
And he did not see it this way.	Et non vidit hoc modo.
But that's pretty great.	Sed ut magna satis.
with no ID.	Cum id nulla.
But they are not the same.	Sed non sunt ipsum.
Now it's okay.	Iam bene est.
I know what is true	Scio quod est verum
I know what you really wanted?	Scio quid vere voluit?
Something.	Aliquid.
I haven't seen it here either	Non eam vidi, hic vel
He wanted only one thing.	Unum tantum voluit.
But you're not too good.	Sed non nimium bonus es.
I don't want to go through this again	Nolo ire per hoc iterum
'in'	' apud '.
This one is true	Verum hoc unum
I want to feel alive	Volo sentio vivere
No one thinks this.	Nemo id putat.
I see what you mean by it	Video quod vult eam
It is morning to say.	Mane est dicere.
I told him everything	Dixi ei omnia
I can't see enough!	Non possum satis videre!.
It is.	Est.
It will do absolutely nothing.	Prorsus nihil facturus est.
Nothing is true.	Nihil verum est.
I didn't want to know, not really.	Scire nolui, non vere.
For he knew.	Sciebat enim.
And yet! 	Et sed!
.	.
No one knew where he was.	Nemo scivit ubi esset.
Maybe you've never met.	Forsitan numquam occurrit.
I know you still have.	Scio te adhuc habere.
I thought they'd be behind us	Cogitavi fore post nos
We could barely hear.	Nos vix audire potui.
This is him.	Hic est eum.
He said that he had a good time.	Bene se habere dixit.
And well, this is bad.	Et bene, hoc male.
I knew there me	Sciebam ibi me
Not even here now	Hic ne nunc quidem
He made the journey at night.	Nocte iter fecit.
You can see, but you can't understand.	Videre potes, sed intelligere non potes.
I don't always know this	Non semper scit hoc
What he did to me.	Quod fecit mihi.
Certainly not now.	Certe non nunc.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
In this way we know what it is.	Hoc modo scire nos quid est.
Now I need to talk to you	Nunc opus est tibi loqui
I can't think of this now	Non possum cogitare de hoc nunc
He has friends.	Hic amicos habet.
I hope you can understand me	Spero te posse intelligere me
No one is doing it.	Nulla quis enim id facere.
But we cannot.	Sed non possumus.
You can do whatever you want.	Facere velis quod potes.
i thought you were coming like this	Putabam te venire sic
I could not go home.	Domum ire non potui.
I need to find out who	Mihi opus est ut de quis
There he said.	Ibi dixit.
This cannot be.	Hoc esse non potest.
I just wanted to be alone	Ego iustus voluit esse solus
You can do more with it.	Plus potes cum illo.
I think you help me	Puto te adiuvet me
To-morrow it is nothing.	Cras id enim nisi.
You need to do this.	Opus hoc facere.
I've never seen anything like it before or after.	Nunquam ante vel post simile aliquid vidi.
He could not be certain.	Certum esse non potuit.
No good thing has been asked of you.	Nemo bonus rem quaesivit a te.
I knew the future	Sciebam futurum
it seems to be evil.	malum esse videtur.
Now what is already there, let me tell you how things are here.	Iam quod iam est, me tibi quomodo res hic sunt.
I just want it again	Ego iustus volo eam iterum
I haven't even asked for your name	Non quidem quaesivit nomen tuum
There was too much work to do.	Nimium erat opus facere.
Hardly to hear.	Vix enim audire.
He could do so much.	Tam potuit.
Well you can go.	Bene potes ire.
That's not so how.	Ut non sic quam.
I know you don't exist	Scio te non esse
I don't want to do it	Non vis ut faciam illud
I had so much to think	Tantum habui, nimium cogitare
I will tell him	Dicam ei .
Never be so happy	Numquam tam felix
A similar thing happens today	Similis res hodie fieri
I knew what you did to him	Sciebam quid ei fecisti
I wanted to do something else	Volui aliquid aliud facere
I don't think you believe in yourself	Non puto te in te
That's where he wants to be.	Id ubi velit.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
It was not working at the time.	Non opus erat tempore.
This is all we have	Hoc est, omnes habemus
It can be a good one.	Bene unum esse potest.
He asked how it was.	Quaesivit quomodo esset.
I saw her, was with someone.	Vidi eam, erat cum aliquo.
To help you if you need help	Ut adiuvet te, si auxilio opus est
It is not true.	Non est verum.
I can't say who you are	Non possum dicere quis es
He did all this in his own.	Hoc totum in suo fecit.
So often this is true.	Ita saepe hoc verum est.
He likes to take some time to be honest.	Velit quam aliquam, ut sit amet.
Certainly he does not concern himself in this way.	Certe hoc modo non spectat.
This is hard for me.	Hoc mihi difficile est.
I need to do something about it	Mihi opus est ad aliquid de eo
Yes, here you are.	Sic, hic es.
I don't know if it's true	Nescio si verum est
I just forgot about it	Ego iustus oblitus de eo
I thought that was	Cogitavi id quod erat
I really hope you will	Ego vere spero te velle
I can do all things.	Omnia possum.
I want to hear from you	Volo te audire
I can do better than	Non possum facere melius quam
I am sick of this now	Ego sum male de hoc modo
I'm happy to leave this post	Sum felix post haec relinquere
I don't have time now.	Non habeo tempus nunc.
Got there for the first time.	Ibi primum obtinuit.
I don't want to live	nolo vivere
So perhaps you are right.	Ita fortasse recte.
I want this to be	Volo hoc est
It can still be done.	Potest tamen fieri.
I couldn't think of anything else to do	Non potui cogitare de aliud facere
But you can't have both.	Sed utrumque habere non potes.
That is very good.	Quod valde bonum est.
I've never seen her.	Nunquam eam vidi.
A little more.	Paulo plus.
He will be there one day.	Una dies ibi erit.
I knew not him	Sciebam non ipsum
It is not his.	Non suo.
I don't like him	Non placet ei
And yet he was not.	Et adhuc non erat.
This is different.	Hoc aliud est.
That's where it was.	Ut in erat quam.
I only know your nationality	Tantum scio genus tuum
I thought, it's time	Cogitavi, tempus est
I tried to think something else	Conatus cogitare aliquid aliud
I don't know what is this	Nescio quid hoc
I feel better now, really	Melius nunc sentio, vere
I don't need him anymore	Non opus est ei amplius
This is not a plan.	Hoc non est consilium.
Without him he can't win.	Sine illo non potest vincere.
I love you, you know that	Te amo, tu scis quod
I wish I could not.	Utinam non.
I thought I was saying	Putavi dicere
I didn't know what to do	Nesciebam quid faceret
Maybe it's very good.	Fortasse ipsum bonum.
And this was the teacher.	Et hic magister erat.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
I told myself everything was okay	Dixi me omnia esse bene
But that was not likely to happen.	Sed id verisimile non erat futurum.
I can't say who he is	Non possum dicere quod quis est
But there was also nothing.	Sed et erat nisi.
He got the job.	Ille officium obtinuit.
I knew I could hear	Sciebam me posse audire
Never tell the truth	Numquam ei verum
Yes I am doing this	Ita non sum faciens haec
And here who is.	Et hic quis est.
I can't get enough of him	Non possum satis ab eo
I need to be well	Opus est ut bene sit
I have heard your name.	Audivi nomen tuum.
I knew I could do it	Sciebam me facere
He had a lot to do with everything.	Multum habuit, ut ad omnia.
You never did.	Numquam fecisti.
I hope nothing happens	Spero nihil acciderit
If so, it's fine.	Quod si ita est, Bene.
I heard it for a long time.	Diu audivi.
I only had to make it	Tantum erat ut eam
Now get one	Nunc ut unum
i will do it again.	iterum faciam.
Only one week!.	Una septimana tantum!.
When he was at home.	Eum ubi domi.
I think you hear him	Puto eum audire
That is not likely.	Quod non est verisimile.
I don't even need to say it	Non quidem opus est dicere ei
Please be happy tonight.	Sis felix hac nocte esse.
I could not think of it	Non potui cogitare de illo
I certainly don't want to do	Ego certe non vis facere
I can leave tomorrow	Cras relinquere possum
I just came to think about it	Ego iustus factum est cogitare de hoc
I also like to travel when it is time	Ego quoque amo ut iter cum tempus sit
Something seems to be here.	Hic aliquid videtur.
I want to make an effort	Volo facere conatus
I don't know whether it can be done.	Nescio an id fieri possit.
I want you home with me as soon as possible	Volo te domum mecum quam primum
Very well	Valde bene
But they are always there for each other.	Sed semper ibi inter se.
I never saw him like this	Numquam vidi illum sic
I can't think of this	Non possum cogitare de quo

It is true.	Verum est.
I didn't say it was easy	Non dicam facile erat
I need to do something soon	Mihi opus est facere aliquid cito
I told him everything was nothing	Ego ei omnia nihil
I am not the only one doing this.	Non sum solus qui hoc facit.
You did it yourself.	Tu ipse fecisti.

I just want to be in here and now	Ego iustus volo esse in hic et nunc
I want to be someone	Volo esse aliquem

Now who was out.	Nunc quis erat ex.
I can't believe I told you	Non possum credere eum non indicavit tibi
I could not do this	Hoc non potui
Everyone has enough.	Omnibus satis habet.
He never came here.	Numquam huc venit.
If you don't like it, it's also bad.	Si tibi non placet, etiam malum est.
Please take a look.	Vide quaeso.
Now he wants to be himself.	Nunc ipsum ut velit.
I absolutely love mine	Ego omnino amo meum
As I was happy I saw the same	Sicut eram felix vidi idem

I don't see your car	Non videre currus
There was something with me	Fuit res mecum
I wanted to stop	Volui ut prohibere

What is the name?	Quod nomen est?.
That is possible.	Quod fieri potest.
it was already too late.	Sero iam esset.
I have something wrong.	Habeo aliquid mali.
I don't need to do that.	Non opus est facere.
Perhaps this is possible.	Forsitan id fieri potest.
But that's what it is.	Sed id quam est.
I don't know anything about this	Nescio quid de hoc
I wanted to tell you first	Dicere volui tibi primum
He did not understand.	Non intellexit.
He wanted me.	Voluit me.
As and now.	Ut et nunc.
I'm just not ready yet	Ego quoque modo nondum
by as much as you've been through	per tantum fui, quantum tu
You are not a man.	Homo non es.
And time is not with me.	Et tempus non est mecum.
I wish I could be	Vellem me esse
I want to see something	Volo te videre aliquid
I could not see what was happening	Quod fieri non potui videre
Never in, never out.	Numquam in, numquam ex.
I am now something else	Ego nunc aliquid aliud
I don't have time either.	Non tempus vel per.
I don't believe that	Non credo quod
Not right at all	Non recte cum omnino
I don't know him but	Ego non scio eum, sed
Nothing else.	Nihil aliud.
I don't think she loves	Non puto eam amat
Look this way.	Vide hoc modo.
It's pretty good.	Satis est bonum.
I need it.	Mihi opus fuit.
He did not say where.	Non dixit ubi.
I feel good now.	Nunc bene sentio.
I like the book.	Librum mihi placet.
I could barely see	Vix videre potui
I'll say it again.	Dicam iterum.
he did not know there was so much.	tantum erat nesciebat.
I can't say who it was.	Quis esset dicere non possum.
Good for me, but not so much.	Bonum mihi, sed quantum.
Do it yourself.	Facere te ipsum.
All is well.	Omnes bene.
I tried not to think about it	Conatus sum non cogitare de illo
No but before.	Nulla sed ante ante.
You are so.	Sic es.
leave me everything	Me relinquere omnia
I love you all so much	Tantum te amo omnes
This is not going to happen yet	Hoc tamen non futurum
But not always through this.	Sed semper non per hoc.
This is not something.	Hoc non est aliquid.
This he did.	Hoc fecit.
There is no truth to what you speak of.	Non est verum quod loqui de.
I don't know exactly how long.	Quam diu prorsus nescio.
Only thing please.	Res tantum, quaeso.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
i knew, i knew	scivi, scivi, etiam
I want him to do something else	Volo eum aliquid aliud
I can really do this work.	Hoc opus vere facere possum.
This must be done soon.	Hoc mox faciendum est.
I told him to just let me get out of it	Ego ei ut iustus me ut ex eo
Good to have you here.	Bene habere hic.
None of the above.	Nulla in dictum est.
I want and you still have	Ego volo et adhuc habes
He understood now.	Intellexit nunc.
But there was no time.	Sed non tempus erat.
He was very happy.	Valde felix erat.
I go for it	Ego pro eo
I know who he is with	Scio is qui est cum
He came here already.	Hic iam venit.
I could not speak the truth	Non potui verum dicere
But look at yourself.	Sed vide te.
I was not good enough	Non eram satis
But as for.	Sed ut enim.
Most likely he did it.	Verisimile id fecit.
I'm afraid to	Vereor ut
I can't say she likes you	Non possum dicere quae vult te
I tried to say something.	Conatus est aliquid dicere.
You don't have time.	Tempus non habes.
and thought.	et putavit.
I want to talk to him	Volo dicere ei
It's not so much about me.	Non ita fere mecum est.
I wonder why he didn't do this.	Miror cur hoc non fecerit.
It is certain.	Certus est.
I hope to hear from you.	Spero a te audire.
I'm just here.	Hic tantum me.
By the time	Ad tempus.
For he wanted to do more.	Plus enim facere voluit.
But this cannot be rightly done.	Sed hoc recte fieri non potest.
Too much and too loud.	Nimis multa et magna.
It was certainly not so bad.	Non ita certe malum fuit.
Stay with us.	Mane nobiscum.
Certainly never.	Certe numquam.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
It was time.	Tempus erat.
Lunch was definitely for me	Certus eram prandium est mihi
But he did not begin to speak.	Sed non incepit loqui.
I have to find how to deal with this	Habeo invenire quomodo agere hoc
It has been so hard	Non tam difficile fuit
And certainly it is.	Et certe est.
But there are people like none.	Sed sunt qui ut nulla.
I knew exactly what it was about	Prorsus sciebam quid esset de
And there is no way to say	Et non est ita dicere
I could not speak or think more	Non potui loqui vel cogitare amplius
May that be one thing.	Sit id unum.
I could not do more.	Non potui amplius.
Even more than you know.	Plus etiam quam scis.
That really isn't good.	Quod vere non est bonum.
I also	Ego quoque
What things did he do.	Quae res fecit.
That's what we're about to do.	Quod est quid de hoc facere sumus.
This is good.	Hoc bonum est.
I could do it on my own	Mea facere potui eam
I didn't know what else	Ego nesciebam quid aliud
I knew looking well	Sciebam vultus bene
I have seen and heard enough	vidi et audivi satis
And me.	Et me.
I didn't know what I needed	Nesciebam quid mihi opus esset
I am not sure.	Non sum certus.
I want to be today	Volo ut esset hodie
I wonder that someone loves me	Miror quod aliquis amat me
I never thought till now	Numquam cogitavi usque nunc
I will say nothing more.	nihil amplius dicam.
Get better than you think.	Ut melius quam cogitas.
He asked where he got it.	Quaesivit ubi eam obtinuit.
He wanted to help.	Adiuvare voluit.
Where is he today.	Ubi hodie est.
I didn't want to take it.	Nolui accipere.
I wonder if I can see	Miror si videre potest
Tonight if possible.	Hac nocte, si fieri potest.
I hardly even know him	Vix etiam novi eum
But without.	Sed sine.
I love you very much, I love you very much.	Valde te amo, valde amo.
This is not correct.	Hoc non bene.
do what you wanted	faciam quod voluit
But instead, we're here.	Sed pro, hic sumus.
Or so she thought.	Vel sic putavit.
I wish it wasn't too late.	Utinam non sero esset.
Who to think.	Qui ut videtur.
I am not certain.	certum non sum.
That's really good.	Ut, vere bonum.
I couldn't deal with it now	Non potui agere cum eo nunc
I don't have to accept that in	Non habeo accipere quod in
He can only stay here.	Hic modo manere potest.
But only one	Sed unum tantum.
It is better from me.	Melius est a me.
This is not one genus	Hoc non est unum genus
i'm very pleased	admodum sum
Not just who we are.	Non solum qui sumus.
Say what you want.	Dic quod vis.
I can't believe you're not so much yet	Non possum credere quod tam adhuc non es
I really love you.	Et vere amo te.
It was not his bad decision.	Non erat malum eius consilium.
And no one.	Nec quis.
I wonder what no one thought before	Miror quod nemo cogitavi ante
i was and something else, something more	ego eram et aliquid aliud, plus aliquid
This is your.	Tuum est.
This was very well.	Hoc erat optime.
It's your room after all.	Post omnes cubiculum tuum est.
Something to do now.	Nunc aliquid facere.
Here's what I like before.	Hic quis ut ante.
No one could tell me what I was doing.	Nemo mihi dicere potuit quid facerem.
Would you like to play with?.	Visne ludere ad ?.
I want to hear from you	Volo a te audire
I couldn't believe she never told me about this	Non potui credere illa numquam indicavit mihi de hoc
You don't want to see him	Non vis ad eum
I can't do anything	Non possum facere quicquam
And I don't like it.	Et non placet.
I could see what it was	Non potui videre quid esset
It was so.	Ita erat.
It is mine.	Meum est.
He did that.	Faceret id.
I don't know what you're trying to say when	Nescio quid tu ubi dicere conatur
I need her as well	Mihi opus est ei ut bene
He does his job.	Eius officium facit.
I can't tell her that	Non possum dicere ei quod
I love this time with him	Hoc tempus cum eo amo
I didn't know what it was all about	Ego nesciebam quid esset de omnibus
The design is pretty much the same.	Simile fere consilium.
I thought it might help	Cogitavi ut adiuvet
Most likely, rightly so.	Verisimile, recte.
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
Nothing much has been done.	Nihil multum factum est.
Even not before him.	Etiam nec ipsum ante.
But we are all men.	Sed omnes homines sumus.
I see why.	cur video.
I did not say what was true.	Non dixi, quod verum erat.
I really don't have much advice	Ego vere non multum consilium
I know, but you do well	Scio, sed bene facit
That is,.	Ille est,.
I can't go with him.	Non possum ire cum eo.
No one said it.	Nemo dixit.
Now there was no problem.	Iam quaestio non erat.
This was better.	Melius hoc erat.
I can't live up to it	Non possum vivere usque ad eam
I couldn't think of anything else to say	Non potui cogitare de aliud dicere
I could do the same	Idem facere potui
I thought.	Cogitavi.
Everyone says they are really fun	Omnes dicit se esse vere amet
Nothing has ever been so.	Nihil umquam tam.
I just thought you should know about this	Ego iustus cogitavi de hoc scire debes
That's too good.	Quod nimium bonum est.
Everyone would just play and play.	Omnes solum futurum et ludere.
I would say a lot	Dicam multum fore
I thought good	Cogitavi bonum
Let it be.	Sit.
I wanted to tell you as always	Volui te dicere, ut semper
What is this to be	Quid est hoc esse.
I thought it would be fun	Putavi fore amet
I'm ready for something new	Ego paratus sum ad aliquid novi
I didn't want it	Non volui eam
I have a name for it	Nomen habeo pro eo
I was here with the chance	Hic eram cum forte
I probably have nothing to do with it	Ego probabiliter nihil cum eo
I didn't know it was needed	Ego nesciebam ut opus esset
I couldn't find anything else	Non potui invenire aliquid aliud
I want to be there soon	Ibi volo et mox
never see you	Nunquam te
But I couldn't do anything for the job.	Sed non aliquid facere potuit ad officium.
When this was done.	Quod cum factum esset.
I tried to do it.	id facere conatus sum.
I'll tell him when I get home.	Dicam cum illo domum.
Has something about it.	Habet aliquid de illa.
No one can do it in any way he does.	Nemo id facere potest quo modo facit.
Yes, that was some.	Etiam id aliquam erat.
That's it for now.	Ut id nunc enim.
I have everything here	Habeo omnia huc
I also think something to say	Ego quoque cogitare aliquid dicere
I think it would be very good.	Puto fore id ipsum.
Not much better than that.	Non multo melius quam illud.
No one has to say where he is.	Nemo habet dicere ubi sit.
Don't do everything.	Noli omnia.
Or better, what both of you want.	Vel melius, quid utrumque vis.
But it was not as for.	Sed non erat ut enim.
But this is true.	Sed hoc est verum.
There was no one who could speak of this.	Nemo erat qui de hoc loqui posset.
I never said it before	Numquam ante dixit
If he did not do it tonight, he would never do it.	Si hac nocte non faceret, nunquam faceret.
I haven't gone anywhere	Et non abiit huc
No he is not himself.	Nulla non est ipsum.
I could not win.	Vincere non potui.
rightly, wrong.	recte, malum.
It is the same.	Idem est.
It was great.	Magna erat.
Happy to be seen.	Felix videri.
I just thought of something	Ego iustus cogitavi aliquid
This should not be done.	Hoc fieri non debet.
We can do the same.	Idem facere possumus.
I didn't know what I was going to do	Ego nesciebam quid esset facturus
It's done with me.	Apud me factum est.
I wanted to say it was not	Volui dicere non erat
It is the same with us.	Idem nobiscum est.
I really like to do that	Ego vere amo facere quod
It was not enough.	Parum fuit.
I never wanted this whole thing to happen, you know	Numquam hoc totum fieri voluit, tu scis
And you have a lot of options here.	Et bene multum hic habes.
This was more than ever needed now.	Hoc plus quam umquam nunc aliquid opus fuit.
I don't need it until noon.	Non enim opus est usque ad meridiem.
Without that.	Quod sine.
No one seems to be at home.	Nemo domi esse videtur.
It is important to be great.	Aliquam sit amet magna.
i'll do it for you.	faciam vobis.
He knew that he was not.	Scivit se non esse.
I am for you	Ego pro vobis
I can totally say when	Non possum prorsus dicere, cum
It has been a long time.	Non diu fuit.
Not well.	Non bene.
I would like to see.	Vellem videre.
I think the book will surely live up to its name	Puto librum certe usque ad nomen eius vivere
He did nothing easy for me.	Nihil mihi facile fecit.
I hope all is well	Spero recte omnibus
You're home again.	Domum iterum es.
I wanted to talk to you first	Volui loqui ad vos primum
He didn't want to know, for sure he was.	Noluit scire, certe erat.
Better, not said, better.	Melius, non dixit, melius.
I know what we can be	Scio quid esse possumus
I just love you so much	Ego iustus amo tantum
That's not the same thing.	Ut non ipsum.
I know how and who	Ego scio quomodo et quis
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
Hardly to see him.	Vix se videre.
Got what he wanted again.	Quod iterum voluit obtinuit.
I made some money last week.	Pecuniam aliquam feci proxima septimana.
I can't get out of it	Non possum ex eo
Not much at all.	Non multum omnino.
It's hard to think.	Cogitare difficile est.
He is a really good dog.	Vere bonus canis est.
I knew you were alone	Sciebam te solum esse
I don't need too much	Non opus est nimis
Certainly you are a boy.	Certe puer es.
Not already.	Non iam.
I have to say something else	Habeo dicere aliquid aliud
But, let him go.	Sed, eat.
They are after all men.	Post omnes homines sunt.
Now there was not any.	Nunc non aliquam erat.
Yes this is work.	Ita est hoc opus.
I just wasn't sure where	Ego iustus erat certus ubi
But not before.	Sed non ante.
I want to give	Volo me dare
I don't know what to do	Nescio quae facturus est
Well, maybe this is it.	Bene, fortasse hoc est.
Not when he wants.	Nec cum velit.
I've never seen anything like it	Ego numquam vidi simile
I can't talk to him now	Non possum dicere ei nunc
I don't know who was behind us	Nescio quis post nos fuit
I hope not much already	Spero autem non multum iam
I saw you yesterday	Vidi heri
That's what makes you.	Id te facit.
I knew what was going to happen to me	Sciebam quid mihi futurum esset
I know there is something more to come	Scio esse aliquid plus venire
But see what happened to him.	Sed vide quid ei acciderit.
It's pretty bad.	Satis malum est.
And he knew what he was going to do.	Et sciebat quid esset facturus.
I know who he is now	Scio qui nunc est
Yes they are all.	Ita omnes.
I know you want to see both	Scio te velle te videre utrumque
But he knew that this was not true.	Sed sciebat hoc nec verum erat.
Now do something else	Nunc aliquid aliud
I can't believe you're doing this,' he said.	Non possum credere te hoc facere, dixit ei.
I just was with him	Ego iustus erat cum eo
Please don't do it.	Quaeso, ne facias.
It is also great.	Etiam magna.
I don't need any help	Ego non opus est aliquo auxilio
It was not at that time.	Non fuit illo tempore.
but he knew better.	sed melius sciebat.
I really need to talk to someone	Ego vere opus est loqui ad aliquem
to go apparently.	ire ut videtur.
It was so.	Sic erat.
I'm not ready for this	Non sum paratus ad hoc
You are now.	Tu nunc es.
Right about him.	Recte de eo.
I was not alone for a long time	Solus non eram diu
He does this very well.	Hoc optime facit.
You know, it was going to happen.	Scis, futurum erat.
never asked.	Nunquam quaesivit.
So and only.	Sic et solus.
He wanted to do something.	Aliquid vellet.
I probably should be in it	Ego probabiliter debet in eo
This is going to happen to you.	Hoc futurum est tibi.
I want to see you so bad	Volo videre te tam malum
I just didn't know exactly when	Ego iustus prorsus nesciebat, cum
No one ever saw him.	Nemo umquam eum vidit.
He was in the front.	In erat ante.
I know what you are here	Scio quid hic es
me to him	ego me ad eum
There was no time to be honest.	Nulla sit amet tempus erat.
It was the first time.	Primum erat.
He does not know.	Nescit.
i am single shortly	Ego una paulo
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I don't have either for me.	Non habeo vel mihi.
I can't believe anyone here	Non possum credere quis hic
as required.	Quod erat faciendum.
I know that it will be fixed	Scio quod certum erit
I would like to have a little longer	Vellem paulo diutius habere
I don't really need it.	Non vere opus est.
Well tell me what you've done.	Ut bene dic mihi quid tu fecisti.
This season is different.	Hoc tempore aliud est.
I knew this better	Hoc melius scivi
He is not himself	Non est ipse
And it was good for us.	Et fuit bona nobis.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
I don't buy enough.	Non satis emere.
I've heard it.	Audivi id.
i think i was there before	Puto eram ibi ante
And thus it is not necessary.	Et sic necesse non est.
You're better than this.	Melius hoc es.
This is the plan.	Hoc est consilium.
There is nothing here.	Nihil hic est.
So he does it all.	Ita omnes facit.
Not much, you know.	Non multum, scis.
As it was.	Sicut erat.
I really hope that	Ego vere spero autem quod
I don't know for sure.	Nescio quid certe.
I never saw him.	numquam eum vidi.
I just could do this	Ego iustus posset hoc facere
I know almost everyone.	Novi omnes fere.
He was not happy.	Felix non erat.
Will definitely order again.	Certum ut iterum.
I wanted to come and see you.	Venire volui et videre te.
But he wants to believe.	Credere tamen vult.
But that is none.	Sed id nulla est.
Your work is done.	Tuum est opus.
Do as much as you can.	Fac quantum potes.
He had time.	Tempus habuit.
I just told him that he could not get it.	Modo ei dixit se habere non posse.
I thought something was wrong	Cogitavi quod esset malum
And again.	Et iterum.
I have it and it looks great	Habeo et spectat magna
You can do it.	Eum facere potes.
Or what about us.	Vel id quod nobis.
And never.	Et numquam.
I think he will live up to him	Puto eum vivere usque ad illum
i don't know what to do	nescio quid facere
I don't mean to do this	Non vult hoc facere
To do nothing, to see nothing, to hear nothing.	Nihil agere, nihil videre, nihil audire.
I think it's not a good decision, but better	Puto non bonum consilium, sed melius
It was already time before.	Iam ante tempus erat.
Well maybe he should.	Bene fortasse debet.
I knew what was going to happen.	quid futurum sit sciebam.
Certainly not ready	Certe non paratus
i'm late.	Sum nuper.
I can't get a job.	Non possum officium.
It is difficult to do well	Bene facere difficile est
It was an easy time.	Facile tempus erat.
I didn't know so late	Nesciebam tam sero
I never got that chance	Numquam obtinuit ut forte
But that is.	Sed id est est.
I can't talk to him	Non possum non loqui ei
Tomorrow is your first time.	Cras sit amet tempus ante.
I think it is great	Puto esse magna
Don't stay here	Non mane hic
I didn't know what it was like	Ego nesciebam quid esset simile
I have a house here.	Hic habeo domum.
I think we are too much	Puto nos nimis multum
But I'	Ego' autem .
That's not good either.	Quod nisi bene vel.
I was not prepared.	Paratus non eram.
The latest one said loudly.	Aliquam quis dictum magna.
As stated in the above.	Ut in dictum enim.
I already know what it is	Iam scio quod est
I don't have time to think about it	Non tempus cogitare de illo
I think you ought to come	Puto nos te venire debere
I don't feel lonely anymore	Non sentio solum amplius
That person is never the same.	Ille homo numquam idem est.
I'm just getting this	Ego iustus questus hoc
You have all right.	Recte habes.
Well, no now.	Bene, nulla nunc.
Not yet with him	Non tamen cum eo
I knew who it was.	Sciebam quis esset.
This season was busy.	Hoc tempus erat occupatus.
I didn't know you	Ego nesciebam te
No one is there.	Nulla quis enim est.
I just don't believe that	Ego iustus non credere quod
That and it is.	Id et est.
I can't do that	Non possum facere quod
This may help.	Hoc ut adiuvet.
They are not the same.	Non sunt idem.
he loves what he does.	amat quod facit.
I don't think what's going to happen	Non puto quid futurum sit
You are not one.	Non unum.
I looked through him	Vidi per eum
I thought that would happen.	Putavi fore.
One day is enough for me	Mihi satis est unum diem
I feel a little sick	Male sentio paulo
I have many things to do	Habeo multa facere
But you.	Sed tu.
If there is anything else.	Si quid est aliud.
I was not the same	Idem non essem
But we are not.	Sed non sumus.
I can help you with that	Non possum tibi cum illo
That has been said.	Id dictum est.
I wanted money.	Pecuniam volui.
Well, maybe not.	Bene fortasse non.
I need to get it	Mihi opus est ut eam
He also doesn't want to choose.	Etiam non velit velit.
It was a great time.	Magna erat tempus.
The boy was lucky.	Felix erat puer.
I wanted to know the truth	Scire volui verum
He will always be with you.	Semper tibi erit.
she's still, still.	illa adhuc, adhuc.
I can't believe what you have here	Non possum credere quod habes hic
I'm sorry for not being with you	Paenitet me non esse apud te tua
Yep till day	Vidi usque diem
I just don't need it	Ego iustus non opus est
But it was great.	Erat sed magna.
There is no such thing as nothing.	Nulla id quam nisi.
That is not the case now.	Quod iam non est.
Which was not very true.	Quod parum verum fuit.
But not the time itself.	Sed non tempus ipsum.
I think that's good	Puto quod bonum est
Today	Hodie.
It's pretty much me.	Satis multa de me est.
Do it well in the morning.	Bene mane facias.
I just want to do one tonight	Ego iustus volo facere unum hac nocte
I love you too.	Te quoque amo.
They are not per se.	Per se non sunt.
We never wanted to stay here	Numquam voluit nos hic manere
I need to think about something	Mihi opus est ut aliquid cogitare de
I have seen nothing else but him	nihil aliud vidi, sed eum
I want you for dinner	Volo te ad cenam
I don't know whether this is good or not.	Nescio an hoc bonum sit necne.
I tried hard to stop it.	Conatus sum difficile prohibere eam.
I just talk.	Modo loqui.
I can't talk to you about me and you	Non possum dicere ei de me et te
I'm just a man for the job	Ego iustus homo ad officium
Maybe, maybe that's.	Forsitan, fortasse id.
I was already in it	Iam in eo eram
I wanted to do	Cogitare volui facere
I think more than you think	Ego plus quam tu cogitas

I've never heard anything like this	Ego nunquam audivi aliquid simile

I did my job and got you	Ego feci meum officium et obtinuit te
I just want to do	Ego iustus volo fac
I didn't know she was a boy	Nesciebam non erat puer
It seemed to help.	Non videbatur auxilium.

No one knows why.	Cur nemo scit.
i am scared of something else	Ego vix aliquid aliud
At length he did it.	Tandem fecit.

I like to work	Mihi placet opus est
But it was time.	Sed tempus erat.
I said something completely different	Dixi aliquid omnino aliud
Everything is pretty good.	Omnia satis bene.
I just haven't thought of it before	Modo non cogitavi ante

I could not think like that.	Non potuit cogitare simile.
I could hardly think of anything else	Vix cogitare potui aliud
I never thought it was too bad	numquam etiam malum illud esse putavi
But this is not to do.	Sed hoc non est facere.
I saw nothing	Vidi nihil
Yes they are all.	Ita omnes.
We do not have.	Non habemus.
I could see what it was	Non potui videre quid esset
But this is enough for me.	Sed hoc mihi satis est.
I also don't sit well	Ego quoque non bene sit

And you can never see me all.	Et nunquam tu omnia me videre potes.
I just really love you	Ego iustus vere amo te
I just want to live	Ego iustus volo vivere
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
This is very hard for me to believe.	Hoc mihi valde difficile est credere.
I can't give what it is	Non possum dare quod est

I know you can hear	Scio te audire potes
I can't help you.	Non possum te adiuvare.

Nothing I could do for him	Nihil potui ei
I owe it to a man	Ego enim homo debet eam
Great to see you here.	Hic te videre magna.
But there is more work.	Plus tamen eft opus.

I only had lunch	Tantum habuit prandium

He can win.	Vincere potest.
Almost like him.	Eum fere similis.

What I would do	Quod facerem
The boy has gone, he has gone.	Puer abiit, abiit.
Well I could trust him	Bene credere potui ei

I've never heard of this guy before	Ego numquam audivi de hoc guy ante
I would not even speak of it.	id etiam loqui nolui.

And he could not understand evil.	Et malum intelligere non potuit.
I don't see anyone from	Ego non video quis de
We don't have time.	Non tempus habemus.
There are some	Aliquam nulla sunt
I'd always thought of something else.	Semper vellem aliud cogitare.
I hope that	Spero quod
She didn't know if this could be any longer.	Nesciebat si hoc esse amplius posset.
Just tried to let me know	Tantum conatus me scire
I can hardly speak	Vix dicere possum

Never do something like this	Nunquam aliquid simile hoc
I don't mean anything.	Non aliquid vult.
I don't know what that is.	Nescio quid id est.
I can't do it right, at least not yet	recte non possum, certe nondum
I wanted to stay with you	Volui manere apud te
I don't do anything	Non facere quicquam
And now we're here.	Et nunc hic sumus.
After this, not much for her.	Post haec, non multum ad eam.
I just didn't want to say right	Ego iustus noluit dicere recte
I heard something similar.	Audivi aliquid simile.
This could not have been done.	Quod fieri non potuit.
I have to take her home.	Habeo ut eam domum.
To help me.	Ut me adiuvet.
This week has been better.	Hoc septimana melius fuit.
I'm sorry for having done this	Paenitet me fecisse
I was able to do this all day.	Totum diem hoc facere potui.

It doesn't seem so bad.	Non ita malum videtur.
I don't need to go well either.	Non opus est ut bene quidem.
There's not much.	Non multum est ibi.
He never was.	Numquam erat.
Things got a little better in the morning.	Res paulo melius mane.
I don't want you.	Nolo tibi.
There's nothing that's great.	Nulla ut magna nisi.
I really think you do	Ego vere cogitare facit
It's actually not looking very good to me.	Suus 'vere non vultus valde bona est mihi.
That is true today.	Quod hodie verum sit.

I wasn't there anymore	Non eram ibi amplius

That's right.	Ut recte factum est.
I like this class.	Placet hoc genus.
To go through everything.	Ire per omnia.
I think that's her name	Puto quod nomen eius
Now more than ever.	Nunc a semper quam.
He had nothing to say about him.	Nihil habuit de eo dicere.
I was not after this.	Post hoc non fui.
I would not believe it.	Credere nolui ex eo.
I know what I will do	Scio quod facturus sit

I want to learn to trust him again	Volo scire credere ei iterum
I was ready this time.	Paratus eram hoc tempore.
I want time to think.	Tempus volo cogitare.
I thought a question	Cogitavi quaestio
How the matter is.	Quomodo res se habet.
I don't know whether I'm gonna be or not	Nescio utrum me amet necne
I could do it alone	Non potui facere solum
He did not see me.	Me non vidit.
I really don't want to talk to someone	Ego vere noluit loqui ad aliquem
He refused to stop.	Noluit prohibere.
Maybe it's either.	Aliquam vel est est.
I'm ready to hear what he meant to say	paratus sum audire quid dicere vellet
I just don't have time.	Modo non habet tempus.
That was you.	Ut id erat te.
I know you haven't seen it	Scio te non videri eam

I still do.	adhuc facio.
I know you know the truth	verum scio te scire
I can't believe it's happening now	Non possum credere id nunc fieri

I don't think so	Non puto esse
I never got up with mine	Numquam obtinuit cum mea
There	Ibi.
I just don't know.	Modo nescio.
But soon there was a problem.	Sed cito esset quaestio.
I don't think it's going to be	Non puto futurum
I used to see you	Eram te videre
I'm glad that you like	Gaudeo quod tibi placet
I'd like to see her doing really well.	Libet videre eam rem bene facere.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
You don't need to come to me.	Venire ad me non debes.
I don't do anything to you	Non aliquid tibi
I see nothing yet.	Nihil adhuc video.
Every day.	De die in diem.
Maybe it was time.	Aliquam id tempus erat.
Now you are here.	Nunc hic es.
We can talk about something else.	Aliquid aliud loqui possumus.
I think you can take me home	Puto te potest accipere me in domum suam

That she did.	Id fecit.
If you want to hear.	Si vis audire.
I don't think too hard	Non puto difficile
Good to see you again.	Bene te videre iterum.

I'm trying to think	Ego cogitare conatur
Well, a little.	Bene, parum.
Never so	Numquam ita

Should I owe anything?	Debeo quod debes?

I am so glad that you are here.	Ita gaudeo quod hic es.
I don't mean to take that much	Non vult accipere quod multum

I just didn't want to like him	Ego iustus noluit similis ei
I love to hear you speak	Amo te audire loqui
I can understand this.	Hoc intelligere possum.
I already knew who it was	Iam sciebam quis esset
I can't live anymore	Non possum vivere amplius
I don't want to go into it	Non vis ire in illud
That's good for us all.	Quod bonum est nobis omnibus.
But to whom it was.	Sed ad quam id erat.
Nor is it going to happen.	Nec futurum.
I have done it, and I am still doing it.	feci, et adhuc facio.
In this way he did not, he said.	Hoc modo non fecit, dixit.
It was not intended.	Non voluit.
That is, we are not.	Hoc est, non sumus.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.

I wanted to do better.	Facere te volui melius.
I don't quite know what to do	Non satis scio quid facere
I'm glad to hear it	Gaudeo me audire eam
But this is not quite right.	Sed hoc non satis recte.
Yes something is possible.	Ita aliquid fieri potest.
but I don't know how and perhaps it will never be	verum nescio quantum et fortasse numquam erit
I didn't have to listen to him anymore	Non habui eum audire amplius
This is what he wanted.	Hoc est quod voluit.
But still a good question.	Sed adhuc bonum quaestio.
I love to do what you want	Hoc facere quod amo vis
You don't do it on me.	Non facis in mea.
I'm not quite sure if it's right or not.	Non satis certus sum si recte vel non est.
It seems to me he can't win.	Mihi videtur vincere non potest.
You don't have money with me	Non habere pecuniam mecum
He doesn't want to.	Non velit.
I have a book too.	librum nimium habeo.
To help.	Ad auxilium.
but I wished.	volui, sed.
what I feel.	quod sentio.
A good man can get money in it.	Homo bonus pecuniam in illo potest accipere.
I don't believe that	Non credo esse
I just didn't know where I was	Ego iustus nesciebam ubi esset
We don't have that time yet.	Non habemus id tempus, sed.
There is still a lot of work to do.	Multum adhuc opus est.
I just didn't understand what time it was	Ego iustus non intellexit quod tempus erat
I never bought into that deal	Numquam emit in eo multum
That is you.	Id est, tibi.
I can't do it any time	Non possum facere aliquo tempore

He knew he probably wouldn't help.	Sciebat probabiliter non adiuvare.
Not long enough generally.	Non satis diu fere.
Now we're here.	Nunc hic sumus.
This is so hard to believe.	Hoc tam difficile est ei credere.
I need to do something about it	Mihi opus est facere aliquid de illo

I don't need a day	Non opus est diem
I was at night	Fui nocte
I can't say it, but	Non possum dicere, sed
Forgot the dog till now.	Canem usque nunc oblitus est.
He is the same.	Ipse est.
But that is only.	Sed id est nisi.
So he has.	Ita habet.
Or you're great.	Vel magna te.
I could not do what she was saying	Non potui facere quod illa dicere
I could not be able to act	Non potui agere posse
I can say yes now	Etiam nunc possum dicere
Now I could work it	Nunc potui opus est

I just want you to think that	Ego iustus volo te cogitare quod
That was really something.	Quod vere erat aliquid.
Nothing knows much.	Nihil scit multum.
All three still exist	Omnes tres adhuc est
I'm not ready for this	Non sum paratus ad hoc

It will be great there.	Magna erit ibi.
I couldn't think of how hard it was	Non potui cogitare quam difficile esset ei

I really never.	Ego vere numquam.
That's what he did.	Id ipsum quod fecit.
I just really want to talk to you	Ego iustus vere volo loqui ad vos

I was more than happy to do it.	Plus quam felix essem id facere.
It was good for me.	Bene mihi fuit.
Now it was not necessary.	Nunc non erat necesse.
But nothing but	Sed nihil nisi.
Please think about it this way.	Hoc modo de eo cogitare placet.
I have seen you all	Vidi in omnibus
We can still talk.	Adhuc loqui possumus.
I just want to do everything.	Ego iustus volo facere omnia.

I know a lot and have seen it	Ego multum scio et vidi eam
I don't know what you think	Nescio quid cogitas
I didn't know you	Ego nesciebam te
I just want to feel it	EGO iustus volo sentio
I could not do it.	id facere non potui.
And finally enough is enough	Et tandem ei satis satis est
You shouldn't think like that	Non debes cogitare sicut quod
I didn't know who it was	Ego nesciebam quis esset
He knows about you.	Scit de te.
I couldn't tell him what to do	Non potui dicere ei quid facere
I don't want to believe that	Non vis credere quod
not cum	Non cum
I'm good at my job	Me bonum meum officium
I can do it for you	Non possum facere vobis

Completely out of it	Omnino ex eo
There is no here without him	Non est hic sine illo
Never say the truth	Numquam verum dicere
He was still here.	Hic tamen erat.
But it has evil.	Sed id habet malum.
All these things are for us today.	Haec omnia nobis hodie sunt.
You don't have all of this.	Hoc totum non habes.

I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
I did not know why.	nesciebam cur.
All these things I know.	Haec omnia novi.
And he did both first.	Et fecit primum utrumque.
But it was not said that he wanted some.	Sed non dictum est, ut aliquam velit.
I need to talk to you about something	Mihi opus est loqui tibi aliquid
I was not, but	Non eram, sed.
That's for sure to see what's going to happen.	Id certe videre quod futurum est.
I feel different.	Aliud sentio.
I couldn't do this anymore	Hoc amplius non potui

But that is not.	Sed id non est.
I know it to be, for sure	Scio eam esse, certe
I did for him	Ego feci pro eo
I just didn't know how	Ego iustus nesciebam quomodo
I could not understand her.	Non potui eam intelligere.
And you owe it, and you can do what is best.	Et debes, et quod melius facere potes.
I hope it would help you.	Spero fore ut te adiuvet.

i think i love it	Puto te amo eam

I can't thank you	Non possum agere tecum
I saw the race before.	Genus ante vidi.
I'm not just saying that.	Im 'non solum dicere.
I know what it is	Scio quod non sit
You don't want to be him.	Non vis esse illum.
and never again.	et numquam iterum.
I tried to understand	Conatus sum intelligere
But getting his work done.	Sed questus opus suum.

I told you she got me	Ego dixi tibi illa obtinuit me
I wanted this alone.	Hoc solum volui.
I know what you like	Scio quid libet
I need to take it.	Debeo accipere.
I completely forgot about the dog	Ego omnino oblitus sum de canem

I will not do that again	Non facio quod iterum
Not in this way.	Non hoc modo.
You don't need to do it anymore.	Non opus est tibi ut facias amplius.
What if he wanted to.	Quae si vellet.
He did it again.	Iterum fecit.
I need to know everything	Mihi opus est scire omnia

She wants me to go with her.	Et vult me ​​ire cum illa.
I did not speak with him.	Non dixi cum illo.

I do not have.	Non habeo.
He seems to be doing fine.	Bene facere videtur.
I don't like it	Non ut eam

I don't think you know that.	Non puto te scire.
I don't want to see you.	Nolo te videre.
You know the truth, though.	Scis verum, sed.

I'll do this just to help you.	Hoc tantum faciam ut te adiuvet.
I'm great to see this for you	Ego magna ut hoc tibi
Man, I believe, would not exist if not	Homo, credo, non esset, si non
I really don't have to go anywhere	Ego vere non habeo huc ire
I just can't help you with this	Ego iustus non possum tibi hoc
The statement was great.	In dictum magna erat.
I know what he's talking about.	Scio quid loquitur.
The matter is so.	Ita res est.
He said why he was here.	Cur hic esset dixit.
But he was not sure how he did it.	Sed quomodo id fecerit non erat certus.
In their own way.	Suo modo.
I hope we will be friends	Spero nos esse amicos
However, they are not bad.	Tamen non mali sunt.
I thought it was true at the time	Putavi verum tempore
He wants and loves him.	Et amet ipsum velit.
Good to see you.	Bene te videre.
I am very happy to meet him	Ego valde felix occurrit ei
It would seem that he cannot prevent it.	Videtur quod non possit prohibere.
I've never even heard of him.	Nunquam etiam de eo audivi.
It is difficult for us too.	Nobis quoque difficile est.
I've never been very good	Ego numquam ipsum bonum est
I hope it doesn't come	Spero autem non venit
Now don't let him out.	Nunc nec ipsum ex.
To have more tonight	Ut non amplius hac nocte
I am not a man anymore	Non sum homo amplius
I could not stop myself.	Me prohibere non potui.
I can't say what it really is	Non possum dicere quod vere est
What do you want to do?	Quid vis ut facias?.
But no great result.	Sed nec magna ex.
I think it's okay to tell you.	Puto suus bene tibi dicere.
That would be for us.	Quod esset nobis.
Here in a.	Hic, a.
That would certainly be so.	Id certe ita esset.
I want to see the house	Volo videre domum
I just bought one.	Modo unum emit.
But there is no question.	Sed ibi nulla quaestio est.
I was always going to be with you	Fui semper futurum esse tecum
Nothing is gonna be none other than that.	Nulla sit amet nulla quam.
I barely had time to e	Ego vix tempus erat ut e
But it was good for me.	Sed bene mihi fuit.
Name? 	Nomen?
he says.	dicit.
I think you know	Puto te scire
But it would be enough.	Sed satis esset.
You don't need to do this thing.	Non opus est tibi hoc facere rem.
But that was how.	Sed id erat quam.
I need you from me.	a te mihi opus est.
I'm not sure how much you understood	Non certus sum quantum intellexit
I want to do everything again	Volo facere omnia iterum
i thought the journey was the way to go	Putabam iter esse iter
I didn't know about everything	Nesciebam de omnibus
So we all.	Sic nos omnes.
I want to go home	Volo ire in domum suam
Something something is something.	Aliquid aliquid esse aliquid.
I have one.	Habeo unum.
I'm sorry to tell you this.	Paenitet me hoc tibi dicere.
I am surprised so much.	Miror tantum.
I could not do it	Facere non potui
I don't believe people	Non credo homines
I want nothing to do with you	Volo facere tecum nihil
No Told or No	Non indicavit nemo vel
It was always so for us.	Sic semper nobis fuit.
But not from you.	Sed non ex te.
I love myself.	amo me.
I hope you don't travel with him	Spero autem non iter cum eo
don't believe me anymore.	Non credo me amplius.
I have done all that you have said, but this is still a question.	Feci omnia, quae dixisti, sed adhuc quaestio haec est.
That's you already.	Id te iam.
He wanted to be there.	Voluit, ibi.
I have nothing to do with today	Ego nihil facere cum hodie
My dog ​​is home alone.	Canis meus solus domi est.
He could do it now.	Potuit nunc facere.
not too hard.	Non nimis difficile.
I am not a man.	Non sum homo.
You're very good	Et nimium bene
And so I want her to be here like this	Et sic volo eam hic esse ut hoc
We can do something about it.	Aliquid de illo facere possumus.
I guess	Suspicor.
You don't need to stop him.	Non necesse est eum prohibere.
I am sure this is true	Pro certo habeo hoc esse verum
I did as you said	Ego feci sicut dixisti
A day after this comes like it never was	A die post haec venit sicut numquam factum est
I forgot to tell either of you	Oblitus sum vel ex vobis dicere
I had to live it up	Ego quoque eam vivere
We can do it for you and me.	Possumus id fieri, me et te.
I can't do this for you	Non possum hoc facere tibi
I know what a father is like	Scio quid pater similis
It really belongs to me	Is vere ad me
Not in any of it	Non in aliquo ex eo
No one knew what it was.	Nemo sciebat quid esset.
I am here if you need anything.	Hic ego sum, si quid opus est.
He does very well.	Optime facit.
I've never seen these things good	Ego numquam haec sunt bona
But that's a lot.	Sed id multum.
You all.	Vos omnes.
i think that is really great	Puto quod est vere magna
Nothing has yet.	Nihil habet adhuc.
I really could get into this with you	Ego vere potui ut in hoc apud te
One thing, another.	Aliud, aliud.
I did, but not anymore	Feci, sed non amplius
I can't stay with him	Non possum manere cum eo
It is still pretty good.	Adhuc satis bona.
Or how not.	Vel quam non.
I can't get home from me	Non possum domum a me
I could not help myself.	Non potui me adiuvare.
I only wanted to see you	Tantum voluit te videre
I know this doesn't really happen	Scio hoc non vere fieri
Or perhaps.	Vel fortasse.
No one said well.	Nemo bene se dixit.
I really can't get it	Ego vere non potest accipere eam
I thought this guy is fun	Hoc guy cogitavi sit amet
We are where we are.	Ubi sumus, sumus.
I already told her that yes	Dixi iam ei quod etiam
I told you already too	Dixi vobis iam nimis
There's nothing great about it.	In id nulla magna.
That was true.	Quod erat verum.
I wanted to help you	Volui tibi
Both are very good.	Utrumque ipsum bonum est.
He was also very sorry.	Etiam valde erat.
This is correct.	Hoc bene est.
Again he went away.	Iterum abiit.
That's kind of it.	Id genus est.
This is way better.	Hoc modo melius est.
I see you soon	Ego te mox
I could not do this	Hoc non potui
he has nothing.	nihil habet.
Maybe even yours.	Forsitan et tuum.
I'm done for you so	Ego feci tibi tam
Not even	Ne quidem.
I need to say it	Mihi opus est dicere eam
I guess that's not a thing.	Suspicor rem non esse.
I knew you did.	Sciebam fecisti.
I want to do it	Ego volo facere
Never apologize for that decision	Numquam paenitet me quod consilium
I don't want to be there	Non vis ut ibi
I think she loves me	Puto me amat
And that's what.	Id autem.
I don't know who it is or anything	Nescio quis sit vel aliquid
I'm too scared.	Vix me quoque.
I wanted to leave you	Te relinquere volui
Or some one's self.	Vel ipsum aliquam aliquam.
.	' , ' .
Certainly I can tell you	Certe possum tibi dicere
He did not know where he was.	Nesciebat ubi esset.
He did not know what it was.	Nesciebat quid esset.
Maybe not.	Aliquam non.
I said you can't do it yourself	Dixi te ipsum facere non potes
But it's a great idea.	Sed a magna quam.
I just want to get away from everything	Ego iustus volo ut ab omnibus
I never knew it could be good	Numquam scivi posset esse bonus
Nothing is for me.	Nihil est mihi.
I really wanted to be a father	Ego vere voluit esse pater
I didn't see him coming in	Non vidi eum venire in
I have to go and see	Habeo ut et vide
I don't need to hear him say that.	Non opus est dicere eum audire.
Unable to speak of me.	De me non posse loqui.
I don't quite understand it	Non satis intelligere est
I feel good	Sentio bene
I thought it was really good	Cogitavi quod factum est vere bonum
But I never know what will happen to me, and what will not be.	Numquam tamen scio quid me futurum sit, et quid non erit.
Traveling not much	Iter non multum
He says to him that it is not.	Dicit ei quod non.
Now I could only do so much	Nunc tantum facere potui tantum
I want you to have this	Volo te habere haec
I wanted to get sick	Male volui ut
I really want to know who he is	Ego vere volo scire quis est
I know nothing at all	Scio nihil omnino
I hope that's it	Spero autem quod est ei
Well not really in front of him.	Bene non vere in ante ipsum.
He wants who he is.	In velit, est quis.
I will do all your good	Faciam omnia bona tua
I thought I could play him already	Putavi posse eum iam
He didn't want to talk about this	Noluit loqui de hoc
Maybe something better out.	Forsitan melius aliquid e.
I guess that's.	Suspicor id.
I couldn't leave it on her	Non potui relinquere eam in se
He did nothing wrong.	Nihil fecit mali.
If anything, he wasn't kind.	Si quid, genus non erat.
Not this time, however.	Non hoc tempore, sed.
He knew it was just a bad day.	Sciebat iustus esse diem malum.
There was none.	Nulla erat.
I believe they can do it well.	Bene facere posse credo.
There is no email	Nulla quis.
I don't think it is very important	Non puto esse valde magna
I don't like this period	Non amo hoc tempus
For you did not make me.	Non enim me fecisti.
Hardly heard the first time	Vix audivi primum
I know for sure	Scio pro certo
I think it would work	Puto fore opus
But yet the same.	Sed tamen idem .
I have to stop it	Habeo ad eam prohibere
That was some fun.	Ut sit amet aliquam erat.
I think it's necessary to say at the moment	Puto necesse est dicere in tempore
.	.
I would like to be someone who can help me	Vellem aliquis esset qui me adiuvet
I'm so happy you are here!.	Im tam felix hic es!.
I didn't want to know anything	Nolui scire quicquam
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
He went to him.	Abiit ut ipsum.
yes she is happy.	Etiam felix est.
Sorry, no sorry.	Nos paenitet nos non paenitet.
I don't like school	Et non sicut schola
As you said.	Sicut dixisti.
No one comes again.	Iterum nemo venit.
I can still get there soon	Non possum tamen illuc primum
It's my same.	Is mihi ipse.
Now is the plan.	Nunc consilium est.
I have seen you.	vidi te.
But to do rather than to do.	Sed facere quam facere.
he does great things.	magna facit.
i love you.	amo ex te.
Never see it either.	Id nunquam vel vide.
I have.	Habeo.
That's how it is.	Id quomodo sit.
and good is better.	et bonum esse melius.
You want to be here.	Tu vis esse hic.
I wanted this for you	Haec te volui tibi
I want to be like him.	similis ei fieri volo.
I want you and only	Volo te, et solus
I need you one more time	Opus est tibi unum tempus
He wasn't going home.	Erat non domum.
Yes and always was.	Etiam et semper erat.
I am more than	Ego plus quam
He could never have seen her.	Numquam potuit eam videri.
That's where it needs to be done.	Id ubi fieri necesse est.
I had a lot to think about	Ego quoque multum cogitare de
I will talk more about it now	Ego plus loqui de eo modo
I know it better	Scio enim melius
He loves us.	Ipse nos amat.
Tomorrow not today.	Cras non hodie.
I wonder if this is true	Miror si verum est
I know well what that boy was up to you	Scio bene quid ille puer esset ad vos
pm me think about it	Me meridiem cogitare de illo
I like better, really	Mihi placet melius, vere
I like to see it	Ego amo video vidi sic
Do what you want and stay longer.	Quod facere velis et diutius manere velis.
I knew not really	Sciebam non vere
I see you there	Ego te ibi
I don't know anymore.	Nescio amplius.
Time that is.	Tempus id est.
But not there.	Sed non ibi.
what I feel.	quod sentio.
See if you like.	Vide si placet.
Not long after this	Non diu post hoc
It is not enough.	Non satis.
Now I know what it is.	Nunc quid sit scio.
It is probably still true today.	Probabile est adhuc hodie verum.
I need someone to tell me what to do	Mihi opus est ad aliquem dicere quid me facere
I told him too soon	Dixi ei nimium cito
So we can do all things together.	Sic omnia simul possumus.
It probably won't be much.	Probabile non erit multum.
Many.	Multum.
I love it here too	Hic quoque amo eam
I was so happy for you and my husband	Tam felix eram tibi et vir
I didn't know what to do.	Nesciebam quid ad rem.
But from there it was great.	Sed a erat magna.
I was there when this was done	Ibi eram quando hoc factum est
I know absolutely nothing	Scio omnino nihil
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
I forgot something	Oblitus sum aliquid
I don't know exactly what it is.	Nescio prorsus quid sit.
If anything is both at the same time.	Si quid est utrumque simul.
He knows what's going to happen.	Scit quid sit futurum.
I know you don't want to see me this way.	Scio te hoc modo videre non vis.
I've seen this	Hoc ego vidi
Maybe it was her name.	Fortasse nomen erat.
I have this for him	Hoc pro eo habeo
I wanted to be good.	bonum esse volui.
I can do it too.	Id quoque possum.
Finally, to him.	Tandem, ad eum.
I'll do this for you.	Hoc tibi faciam.
Not for anyone.	Non pro aliquo.
He wanted something else.	Aliud quid voluit.
But it was great.	Sed magna erat.
I have money friends	Habeo pecuniam amicos
It could be good!.	Posset esse bonus!.
Never say never.	Numquam numquam.
For that you are not one.	Id enim unum non es.
It was so.	Ita erat.
That's good for me too.	Bonum mihi illud quoque est.
I want to hear it	Volo audire eum
But he was ready.	Sed erat paratus.
I've been here too long.	Nimis diu hic sum.
Now just go and do it.	Nunc iustus est ire et facere.
I know this.	Scio id.
Maybe you haven't said it before.	Aliquam non dictum ante.
I didn't want to give in	Nolui dare in
Make the journey.	Iter fac.
You just want to go.	Vos iustus volo ire.
I have to get it out.	Habeo ut eum.
it will be perhaps one day.	id erit fortasse dies unus.
It was easy enough.	Satis facile fuit.
I want something for him	Volo aliquid pro eo
I am a just man.	Homo sum iustus.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
Where do you want to be.	Ubi vis fieri.
Never been alone	Numquam fuisse solum
It was my school.	Schola mea erat.
He was also pretty good.	Erat etiam satis bonus.
I can see well	Non possum videre bene
I want to be myself	Volo quod ipse
I am a little busy just now	Ego sum paulo occupatus sicut nunc
I want it all in	Volo enim in omnibus
i am a little more of it	Ego ex eo paulo plus
To mean something.	Ut sit aliquid.
If you don't want to understand at all.	Quod omnino si non vis intelligere.
Make my day!	Diem meum fac!
Too soon for you.	Nimis cito tibi.
I know him.	Scio eum.
Do what you like with me.	Facere quod libet mecum.
If you can do anything.	Nisi quid potes.
I can be a little late	Non possum esse paulo sero
I love that dog.	Canem illum amo.
And there is nothing wrong.	Et nihil mali est.
I see me as he saw me	Video me sicut vidit me
Not tonight, but soon.	Non hac nocte, sed mox.
But that was not going to happen.	Sed id non erat futurum.
He saw her.	Vidit eam.
That's pretty good.	Id satis bonum est.
I didn't know what it was.	Ego nesciebam quid esset.
It is necessary.	Necesse est.
I want to know how to do it	Volo scire quomodo facere
I have seen both	Vidi utrumque
They had been together.	Fuisse simul.
I really want to help	Ego vere vis auxilium
I love the one	Ego amo per unum
I owe you everything	Omnia tibi debeo
Are you ready?	Esne paratus?
Nothing at all I see	Nihil omnino video
I can't do it without you	Non possum facere sine te
Maybe someone wants.	Aliquam quis velit.
Don't be interested	Non sit amet
It is an evil, but not a bad thing.	Malum est, sed non male.
I absolutely don't doubt	Ego omnino non dubito
I know you're up to something.	Scio te ad aliquid.
I think we can do it	Puto possumus facere
Nothing other than that, though.	Nihil quam id, sed.
I could not do this	Non potui hic facere
The boy can't be.	Puer esse non potest.
He understood now.	Intellexit nunc.
I can't see what you want	Non possum videre quod vis
I need to talk to you as well	Ut opus est loqui ad vos ut bene
Maybe it was or was.	Aliquam vel erat erat.
Nothing, however.	Nihil tamen.
yes it is not said.	Etiam non dictum est.
I can go on and on and on	Non possum ire et in et
It's time and it's him.	Aliquam et est ipsum.
But there is nothing.	Nihil est sed.
It was said to him.	Dictum ei erat.
There is no way to save yourself.	Nulla ut ipsum nisi.
She knows more than that.	Plus novit quam illa.
I just know what you did	Ego iustus scio quod fecit
Now who is it.	Nunc quis est.
Don't play with me.	Noli mecum ludere.
But before him.	Sed id ipsum ante.
I told him nothing that is true	Nihil ei dixi, quod verum est
There was need for this to do it for him.	Ad hoc opus fuit ut eam sibi faceret.
Or at least you can know.	Vel certe scire potes.
I haven't seen much of anything	Non vidi tantum de aliquo
if you know you are	si tu scis es.
This has been done for me.	Hoc mihi factum est.
I really didn't want to go with him	Ego vere noluit ire cum eo
The boy behind me said he would like to know	Puer post me dixit se scire
I'm not sure what to do	Non certus sum quid faciam
You'd better go now.	Ire iam melius velis.
It is important.	Aliquam sit amet est.
Do it this way.	Hoc modo facias.
Even I could not see.	Etiam non potui videre posse.
Now he is talking.	Nunc loquitur.
I can talk about it.	De eo loqui possum.
I did this for you	Haec ego feci tibi
I know what you've done	Scio quid feceris
I've heard quite a lot	Audivi satis multum
That's mine.	Id mea est.
It's not hard to see what's happening.	Id fieri non difficile est videre.
You don't have.	Non habes.
I know what happened with him	Scio quid factum est cum eo
So I tried to help you.	Ita conatus sum adiuvare vos.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
So it is.	Ita est.
We'll always be you this and that	Semper tibi hoc et illud
Why do you do it?	Quare id facis.
And there we are.	Et ibi sumus.
Now there's something.	Iam non est aliquid.
But he was not sure.	Sed non erat certus.
I will not.	Nolo.
Soon.	Mox.
I will say a little different.	Parum aliud dicam.
I knew that there is only one	Sciebam hoc non nisi unum sit
How is it true today?	Quomodo verum est hodie?.
I thought it would be fun	Putavi fore amet
He was not, but was.	Non erat, sed erat.
You have to call me.	Habes ad me.
They are indeed.	Sunt quidem.
I want to act	Volo agere
That's what I wanted to do.	Id facere vellem.
I didn't want him out of me	Nolui eum de me
I would like to talk to you	Vellem loqui tecum
I am absolutely not enough	Ego omnino non satis
Maybe never again.	Forsitan numquam iterum.
All these things I have done	Haec omnia feci
There is no need, nor if you will.	Non opus est, nec si vis.
I wanted something	Volui aliquid
I haven't heard of him.	Ego eum non audivi.
Nothing comes to me.	Nihil venit ad me.
But not only.	Sed non nisi.
There was no time.	Tempus non erat.
I don't know how to do this	Nescio quomodo hoc facere
This has not been done.	Hoc non est factum.
You can also.	Potes etiam.
To do something.	Facere aliquid.
I like it but that's mine	Mihi placet tamen, quod meum est
I'm going to help.	Eo auxilio.
What you don't need right now.	Quae nunc non opus est.
I just hope you know what to do	Ego iustus spero te scire quid facere
together with everyone.	simul cum omnibus.
not each other.	Non inter se.
I've seen this one before	Hoc unum vidi ante
I couldn't find anything like this	Non potui invenire aliquid simile hoc
Certainly you have enough.	Certe satis habes.
How well can you give me all your help?	Ut bene omnia auxilium dare potes mihi
Until that time	Usque ad tempus illud .
I want to be who you want to be	Volo qui vis esse
I could not believe enough	Non potui satis credere
What nationality is it.	Quod genus est.
There was none in him.	Nulla in ipsum erat.
I know what he is	Scio quod ipse
No as stated before.	Nulla ut dictum ante.
I want to make a decision	Volo te consilium facere
I have exactly this.	Prorsus hoc habeo.
i am my mom	Ego meum, meum,
I wanted to say all things well	Omnia bene volui dicere
I don't want to be that way	Volo non esse illuc
Really made me think something about it.	Vere me fecit cogitare aliquid de eo.
He says something about me.	Ei dicit aliquid de mea.
yes I was.	etiam fui.
I hope we'll be well	Spero nos bene erit
I like your work.	Mihi placet opus tuum.
None of us had anything to do.	Nemo erat nobis quid faciendum.
There, he got it.	Ibi, obtinuit.
I don't.	Non facio.
But he was here now.	Sed hic nunc erat.
Or I can understand.	Vel possum intelligere.
Nor does he know why.	Nec scit cur.
I knew what happened	Sciebam quod factum est
I thought about how I can help.	Cogitavi quomodo me adiuvare possum.
never give his advice.	numquam eius consilium.
I hope all.	Spero omnes.
You can give your name whatever you want.	Nomen dare potes quod vis.
This was the room.	Cubiculum hoc erat.
I am sure of it	Ego certe ex eo
I wanted him badly	Male volui illum
That's how I get out of it.	Ut id quam ex.
I knew what all this was	Sciebam quid hoc totum esset
I want to be good.	Volo bonum esse.
I am astonished too.	Miror etiam.
And there will always be again	Et non semper erit iterum
It was too good.	Nimium bonum erat.
I want to tell you something.	Ego volo tibi dicere aliquid.
Who knows what to do.	Quis scit quid sit hoc facere.
I need something to do	Mihi opus est aliquid facere
I don't know you there	Nescio vos ibi
He said the truth.	Verum dixit.
Gone to you long time	Abiit ut non diu
I know what that is.	quid id sit scio.
You are definitely a job man.	Pro certo es homo officium.
No, that was great.	Nulla id magna erat.
I didn't see you coming after me like that	Non vidi te venire post me sicut quod
There is no such thing as before.	Nulla id ipsum ante.
It's long enough.	Satis diu est.
I could see you through it	Non potui te per illum
I have heard nothing further about him.	de illo nihil amplius audivi.
This was my plan.	Hoc mihi consilium fuit.
It was too much.	Nimium erat.
in the morning and often.	Mane et saepe.
I don't want it to go	Non vis eam ire
I was happy again	Iterum felix essem
I could not act, not now	Non potui agere, non nunc
I am not alone for the time	Ego non solum pro tempore
So it is.	Ita est.
I'm not sure if this is possible anymore	Non certus sum si hoc fieri potest amplius
which I owe you at least.	quod tibi certe debeo.
you'll never know.	numquam te scire.
And it was hard to imagine what was going to happen.	Et difficile erat cogitare quid futurum sit.
I'm here for you	Hic ego pro te
I will probably do the same thing myself	Ego probabiliter facere idem ipse
The whole time was	Totum tempus erat
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
You have done your work.	Fecisti opus tuum.
A little later, he is gone	Paulo post, abiit
There is none.	Nemo est.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
Who is she?	Quae est illa?.
I'll tell you what I'm saying	dicam tibi quid dicam
I just wanted him to stop	Ego iustus voluit eum ut prohibere
Never even his name	Numquam etiam nomen eius
probably not.	verisimile non est.
and when I got it.	et cum obtinuit eam.
I know well.	bene scio.
I gave him something	Et dedit ei aliquid
I could not see what was happening	Quod fieri non potui videre
It has been done.	Dictum feci.
It won't be much longer.	Hoc non erit multo diutius.
She could leave him with me.	Mecum illum relinquere posset.
It was something else.	Aliud erat.
hope to see you soon	spero videre te mox
Not that morning	Non quod mane
Maybe for us.	Forsitan nobis.
I never saw people.	Numquam vidi homines.
This was what he wanted.	Hoc erat quod voluit.
I'll say, he's just like his father already	Dicam, hic iustus est sicut pater eius, iam
And it has been said.	Sed et dictum est.
I'll tell you what's good.	Dicam quid bonum sit.
He never wants to do so.	Numquam velit id.
I know I know	Scio me scit
They are not the same.	Non sunt idem.
I hope I'm not sick.	Spero me non male.
And see where it is.	Et vide ubi sit.
It is not necessarily a bad thing.	Necesse non est malum.
I just want him to go.	Modo volo eum ire.
After the time	Post tempus.
But it is not.	Sed non est est.
Can't play.	Ludere potest.
I hope you get one too	Spero te ut unum quoque
Mine was good.	Meus erat bonus.
Tell me what happened.	Dic quid acciderit.
He is a great, great man.	Magna est, magna quis.
Maybe not now.	Aliquam nec nunc.
i think not to help	Puto ne auxilium
Don't play, don't buy.	Noli ludere, noli emere.
This is not true.	Non hoc est.
I am really sorry for it.	Ego vere paenitet ad eam.
A job nobody wanted	A officium nemo voluit
not in time.	Non tempore.
Not only can it, but it.	Non solum potest, sed id.
I looked up to me	Vidi usque ad me
I make friends with everything.	Amicos facio omnibus.
No one has ever done this before.	Hoc nemo umquam ante fecit.
I don't really need to listen	Non vere opus est audire
.	.
I need to live with him and so he did	Ego cum illo vivere debeo, et sic fecit
he did, he said.	fecit, dixit.
He knew he was talking to someone about him.	Sciebat se aliquem de illo loqui.
will not be enough.	Non erit satis.
I think you already have this	Puto te iam hoc
But they are .	Sed sunt .
You can't stay away from it.	Non potes ex eo manere.
I really don't think so.	Ego vere sic non puto.
I really didn't want to talk to him	Ego vere noluit loqui ei
I think we can trust him	Puto possumus credere ei
Tell us about him.	Dic nobis de eo.
It was scarcely possible.	Vix erat.
Nor do we.	Nec nos.
No one could understand.	Nemo potuit intelligere.
I want to tell him about it but not	Volo dicere ei de illo sed non
I really didn't want to do this.	Ego vere hoc noluit.
I could not do this anymore	Hoc facere non potui amplius
I was there barely a day	Ibi vix diem essem
I know what I need to do	Scio quid opus est facere
I don't believe it was	Nec credo fuisse
I don't want you to go	Nolo te ire
I wanted to know what she thought	Scire volui quid putavit
I heard nothing but good things about him.	De eo nihil audivi nisi bona.
I don't want to leave home	Non vis relinquere domum suam
Yes, that was the time.	Etiam id tempus erat.
She just wants to go to school	Illa iustus vult ad scholam
I know what you mean.	Scio quid velit.
My child can do this.	Hoc facere potest puer meus.
i think he is up late	Puto eum nuper usque
Do all you need for you	Fac tibi omnia opus est tibi
I was going to do the same	Idem facturus eram
What he said thus is true.	Quod ille ita verum dixit.
But he doesn't want him.	Sed non ipsum velit.
I don't know what this is	Nescio quid hoc est
I can't really speak.	Non possum vere dicere.
There was no time no.	Nulla nec nunc erat.
I thought that would happen.	Putavi fore.
I totally appreciate it	Ego prorsus bene sit
Who was he indeed.	Quis erat ille quidem.
I've never seen it before.	Nunquam ante vidi.
Play time.	Ludere tempus.
I can't believe he's going to do it	Credere non possum id facturum esse
He went home.	Abiit in domum suam.
I want to be in this cum	Volo hoc esse in cum
I always go there	Ego semper ire illuc
No, you don't.	Non, non facis.
But you are late.	Sed tu sero es.
Well, if not for me.	Bene, nisi mihi.
I need to do but I can't help me	Mihi opus est facere, sed non possum me
perhaps it is.	fortasse est.
But he would not.	Sed nolebat.
I want to be happy	Volo ut felix sit
It was not mine.	Non erat meum.
You don't want me to	Non vis quidem
That's the same for sure.	Id ipsum certe.
I will do this in some way	Hoc faciam aliquo modo
I wanted to hear everything	Volui audire omnia
It was not the same thing.	Non erat id ipsum.
Which seems to be the case.	Quod ita esse videtur.
I don't know how to act	Nescio quomodo agere
I wanted to have.	habere volui.
This might not be what you want.	Hoc ne sit quod vis.
I can't do it without even help	Non possum facere vel sine auxilio
But also.	Sed et.
I said about all the things I thought	Dixi de omnibus quae cogitavi
I'm up to.	Sum ad.
Which he did not.	Quod non fecit.
Not here if not for you	Non hic si non tibi
I don't quite know what this meant.	Non satis scio quid hoc esset.
I wanted to do something with me	Volui ut aliquid cum me
Well said.	Bene dixit.
I just want to be with her	Ego iustus volo ut sit apud eam
which he knew little, he knew not.	quam parum sciebat nesciebat.
I know how to listen	Scio quomodo audire
He's starting out.	Ille proficisci.
There, he did it.	Ibi, fecit.
And it was.	Et fuit.
We need to work.	Opus nobis opus est.
I tried not to think	Conatus sum ne cogitare
I know what we're doing	Scio quid nos facere
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
I want nothing but better	Volo enim nihil nisi melius
Not really.	Non vere.
Too much.	Multo nimis.
Nothing is really bad to say.	Nihil vere malum est dicere.
But I could not believe this to be done	Hoc tamen fieri non potui credere
To order one	Ut ut unum
Certainly I am.	Certe ego sum.
I hope all is well	Spero omnes bene
I didn't know you were coming	Ego nesciebam te venire
I do this for you.	ego hoc tibi.
I wanted a man like my father	Volui vir sicut pater meus
I need to do this	Me opus hoc facere
I managed it	Potui eum
I didn't know how great	Ego nesciebam quam magna
As from before.	Ut a ante.
I am sure that	Ego certe quod
It is.	Sic est.
This time it is still seen.	Hoc tempore adhuc videtur.
You have this one time.	Hoc unum tempus habes.
I see nothing wrong.	Nihil mali video.
But stay with me.	Sed mane mecum.
I could do nothing.	nihil potui.
He didn't want to come here	Noluit venire huc
I could not do it.	facere non potui.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
This owes you a lot.	Hoc tibi multum debet.
And finally talk	Et tandem loqui
It was generally not enough.	Parum fere fuit.
Everyone knows better.	Nescit quis melius.
All in one night.	Omnes una nocte.
I know one day you'll stop	Scio unum diem te prohibere
For some great things.	Aliquam enim magna.
I hope you've done that	Spero te quod factum est
Please don't do it.	Quaeso, ne feceris.
I believe it is the same	Credo, idem est
I can't see him.	Eum videre non possum.
That can't be good.	Quod bonum esse non potest.
To do this.	Id facere.
I wanted to talk to him at least	Volui certe loqui ei
I knew my mom was not good	Sciebam meum, quod non est bene
The father is very good.	Pater valde bonus est.
I could speak to him.	Loqui ei potui .
He looked like her.	Vidit sicut eam.
I have forgotten	Ego quidem oblitus sum
I didn't know how to get e	Ego nesciebam quam ut e
I can easily do this job for you	Facile possum hoc facere officium pro vobis
I was a man.	vir fui.
We are not men.	Non sumus homines.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
All in all, it will be now.	Omnino nunc erit.
I love everything he does.	Amo omnia facit.
He could have done something, but this.	Fecisse aliquid potuit, sed hoc.
I need to talk to	Mihi opus est loqui ad
I want to go on a date	Volo ire in diem
And see where we got.	Et vide ubi nos obtinuit.
To yourself.	Ad te ipsum.
The thing is, it is not.	Res quidem, non.
Finally through.	Tandem per.
Perhaps that is not the case now.	Ut fortasse iam non est.
I've never done this.	Nunquam hoc feci.
I can not.	Non possum.
I would not be there.	ibi esse nolui.
You're not there either	Non te ibi vel
I think we'll be fine.	Puto nos bene erit.
I could not do it.	facere non potui.
never has.	numquam habet.
I don't like him.	Non amo illum.
I said everything's wrong	Dixi omnia mali
Do that correctly! 	Fac ut recte!
He does not do this.	Hoc non facit.
I don't want to live without you.	Sine te vivere nolo.
I want you to stay with him tonight and tomorrow	Volo te manere cum eo hac nocte et cras
I can't talk to me	Non possum dicere me
You should come to us too.	Nobis quoque venire debes.
This was probably said.	Hoc verisimiliter dictum est.
It's always bad.	Semper est malum.
I had to like it	Ego quoque ut illud
I thought you were this	Hoc cogitavi es
But this morning I will say this only.	Sed hoc mane modo hoc dicam.
I already have some dinner	Ego iam cenam aliquam
I want to live without you	Volo vivere sine te
Now that's him.	Nunc id enim ipsum.
he loves his job.	officium suum amat.
Wish it was longer.	Velit erat diutius.
I'm lucky to have a good job	Sum felix habere bonum officium
I know you're a busy man	Scio te esse occupatus homo
How have you done?	Quomodo fecisti?.
I want to see you in the morning	Volo autem, ut te videre mane
He could not.	Non potuit.
You did your work yesterday.	Opus tuum heri fecisti.
This one is good.	Hoc unum est bonum.
I need to chat with him	Mihi opus est loqui cum eo
But you did very well.	Sed tu optime fecisti.
Yes it is possible.	Ita fieri potest.
And who can not do after this?	Et quis post hoc non potest?
I was enough.	satis eram.
But not for long.	Sed non diu.
This is a great question.	Magna quaestio haec est.
But it seemed like it.	Sed videbatur similis eius.
We can not.	Non possumus.
I hope I can be certain.	Spero posse me certum esse.
I really love doing this.	Haec vere amo faciens.
I have something to go.	Habeo aliquid ire.
Sorting in!.	Genus in!.
You don't want me to	Non vis ut mihi
How are you still in it	Ut tamen te in illo
This is mine.	Hoc est meum.
Want to talk to you now.	Vis loqui tecum nunc.
But it's probably neither you nor me.	Sed nec te nec mihi verisimile est.
To not save that.	Ut non nisi quam.
See id.	Vide id.
Maybe something from him.	Aliquid ab eo fortasse.
Yes you know.	Ita scis.
I didn't get this much look at it	Non tantum hoc tantum vultus in eo
He doesn't even know how to say this.	Ne hoc quidem scit dicere.
I just want to be with him	Ego iustus volo fieri cum eo
He did little else.	Parum aliud fecit.
There was no problem with us.	Apud nos haec quaestio non fuit.
All is well.	Omnia bene.
He didn't want it in front of him.	In nec velit ante.
I had work to do	Ego quoque opus facere
He did not say.	Non dixit.
He wanted something else entirely.	Aliud omnino voluit.
and see him again.	et iterum eum vide.
I just knew it was	Ego iustus scivi eum esse
But who he is.	Sed quis quam est.
Now there is none.	Nunc non est.
I couldn't say how long	Non potui dicere quam diu
I didn't know him well	Et ego nesciebam eum bene
I am traveling to the future	Ego sum iter ad futurum
It will be with you and your husband.	Sic erit tecum et vir.
Or something else.	Vel aliud quid.
Take a look at all of this one thing.	Vide omnes hoc unum.
To think.	Cogitare.
But nothing else.	Sed nihil aliud.
I tried like you said	Conatus sum, sicut dixisti
I met the man yesterday	Ego heri occurrit homo
I'm sorry for something wrong that came to you	Paenitet me aliquid mali quod ad te venit
But let's be more than that.	Sed sit amet quam quam.
He didn't like people.	Nolebat homines.
I never understood before	Numquam ante intellexit
Find someone.	Invenire aliquem.
Certainly there is nothing.	Certe nihil est.
I don't know why he wanted to go there.	Nescio cur illuc ire vellet.
They are of us, but without us.	Ex nobis sunt, sed sine nobis.
I am ready to do this.	Paratus sum ad hoc.
This time he got it.	Hoc tempore obtinuit.
That is, there's a lot.	Hoc est, multum est ibi.
None in this no.	Nulla in hac nulla.
I need to persuade you to help me	Mihi opus est persuadere ut adiuvet me
It was certainly enough.	Satis certe fuit.
Really do that	Vere facio quod
Now that's the same thing for us.	Nunc id ipsum est nobis.
You don't want to come	Non vis venire
This is to stay.	Hic est manere.
I didn't know what he said to you	Et ego nesciebam quae dixit ad vos
I knew you couldn't live there anymore	Scivi te non amplius ibi vivere
I just went to think I need to talk	Ego iustus abiit cogitare opus est loqui
I never saw anything happen so quickly.	Numquam tam cito quicquam vidi factum.
Anger.	Ire.
I didn't have to do it.	Non habuit facere.
I am not getting out of this	Non sum questus ex hoc
For this is not true.	Hoc enim verum non est.
I still believe.	adhuc credo.
But that was it.	Id erat, sed.
In your house.	Apud te domum.
I saw too much of me in it	Vidi nimium de me in eam
I'll do it with you.	Ego tecum faciam.
People would be home from school now.	Homines domum e schola nunc fore.
I, one, never could live like this	Ego, unus, numquam sic vivere potui
I can't talk anymore	Non possum dicere amplius
I am so busy at work today	Ego tam occupatus ad opus hodie
A guy like that somehow	A guy ut aliquo modo se habet
I don't know what to say	Nescio quid dicam
You still have.	Adhuc habes.
I did not	Non feci
There is no more.	Non est amplius.
that is you.	id est te.
But he came to me.	Sed venit ad me.
I knew it would be a long time now	Sciebam non diu nunc fore
It's time to be.	Aliquam sit.
I didn't know about him.	Ego nesciebam de eo.
I can't live this way	Non possum hoc modo vivere
I know this for sure	Hoc certo scio
For all.	Pro omnibus.
It could be a job.	Posset esse officium.
I like him more than anything	Ego plus quam similis ei
But this was not for us.	Sed hoc non fuit pro nobis.
I don't know whether he did it.	Nescio an fecerit.
We're on our way to you.	Pro nobis iter ad te sumus.
There was nothing in it.	Nulla in erat nisi.
i still love her.	eam adhuc amo.
I don't know what, really.	Nescio quid, vere.
I'm glad time is never a problem.	Gaudeo tempus numquam quaestio est.
And thus it was still true.	Et sic adhuc verum erat.
It will not always be so.	Non semper sic erit.
It was still enough.	Satis tamen fuit.
And it's just not enough.	Et iustus non satis est.
as to what it is.	ut quid id sit.
He says it to her.	Dicit eam ei.
It's already enough.	Jam satis est.
It would be enough.	Satis esset.
Money is better to live.	Vivere pecuniam melius est.
I can't really believe that	Non possum vere credere quod
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I am nothing at the time	Ego nihil eo tempore
I never saw anything like this.	Numquam hoc simile vidit.
You can do this.	Hoc facere potes.
Something else	Aliquid aliud
I hope you like it	Spero autem tibi placet
But it will be soon.	Sed mox erit.
I hope to see you soon more	Spero te videre cum amplius
It's too late.	Sero ad illud.
He's not going to do it.	Ille non facturus est.
This does nothing.	Hoc nihil facit.
But he could not.	Sed potuit.
I didn't think it was going to happen	Non putavi futurum
I need you to win it for me	Mihi opus est te vincere illum mihi
I just didn't understand	Ego iustus non intellexit
I knew he was a good man	Sciebam erat vir bonus
I really do nothing	Ego vere nihil
which I doubt to be so.	quod ita esse dubito.
I am ready for everything.	Paratus sum ad omnia.
But this has not been said.	Sed hoc non est dictum.
They are men.	Homines sunt.
i thought everything	Putabam omnia
He said that something would happen.	Dixit se aliquid futurum.
I want everything to live	Volo omnia vivere
He knew what he wanted.	Sciebat ille quid vellet.
I'll.	ego te.
But not for him	Sed non pro eo
But there was only one.	Sed quis nisi erat.
I don't want to win like this.	Nolo sic vincere.
I have this per	Hoc habeo per
I need time for me	Opus tempus me
Bad out now.	Malum ex nunc.
She is a man.	Illa est homo.
Not well.	Non bene.
I'd like to think.	Libet cogitare.
Time always seems to win.	Tempus semper vincere videtur.
The name is not the only name	Nomen non solum nomen
I watched for quite some time.	Satis temporis vidi.
I knew looking well	Sciebam vultus bene
I can't quite understand how	Non possum satis intelligere quomodo
I love you, you know that	Te amo, tu scis quod
This same thing.	Hoc ipsum .
This was not successful.	Hoc bene non fuit.
They are not all about you.	Non omnia de te sunt.
But not only or always.	Sed non solum vel semper.
I'm afraid of anything.	Vereor ne quicquam.
Or listen to him.	Vel audire ipsum.
Too much for me.	Nimium me.
So much to see and hear, that's all	Tantum videre et audire, id totum
It was a bad week to do something.	Hoc erat malum septimana ad aliquid faciendum.
I think it's true.	Puto verum esse.
I want to say what it is	Volo dicere id quod est
And that's now.	Et id nunc.
It looks great.	Spectat magna.
I don't feel this way.	Ego non hoc modo sentio.
All you can do is live with it.	Omnes facere potes cum illo vivere.
i am really bad at it	Ego vere malum in eo
What you already know.	Quod iam scis.
I will never come here	Ego numquam non huc venire
We don't like it here.	Non id nobis placet hic.
It can't be.	Non potest esse.
I never regret being with her	Ego numquam paenitet esse apud eam
I have the money	Habeo pecuniam
It can be done.	Potest fieri.
Tell her what you want.	Dicere ei quod velis.
Can't see again.	Iterum videre potest.
This time.	Hoc tempore.
I want him here with me	Volo eum hic mecum
We need your help	Non opus est tibi auxilio
It almost seems like this.	Fere sic videtur.
It's enough.	Est satis.
It cannot be fixed.	Certum esse non potest.
I like to be with you	Mihi placet esse apud te
He doesn't know how to do it.	Nescit quomodo id faceret.
Again he does it.	Iterum id facit.
This is not difficult.	Hoc non est difficile.
This work is not seen yet.	Hoc opus non videtur, sed.
Make one.	Fac unum.
There just isn't much.	Ibi tantum non multum est.
He works very well.	Optime agit.
It's time or out loud.	Aliquam vel magna ex.
I'll tell you what you've done better.	Dicam quid melius feceris.
I think it's better.	Melius puto.
Maybe you don't need it.	Fortasse non opus est.
It is so.	Est ita.
I want you soon	Volo te cum primum
He speaks of himself.	Ipse de se loquitur.
I want to talk to you.	Volo te ipsum loqui.
He truly does.	Vere facit.
I knew, I knew	Sciebam, scivi
I knew that it was not possible	Sciebam enim esse non posse
I don't have enough time	Ego non satis temporis
i thought you already	Putabam iam
She could do everything if she needed	Posset omnia agere si ei opus erat
No, that was not true.	Non, id parum verum fuit.
I don't want to come in the morning	Nolo venire ad mane
You are right.	Recte facis.
He gave it to me.	Dedit mihi.
Yes that is great.	Etiam id magna est.
I can't believe you're done	Non possum credere te factum est
You need to know as soon as you want	Opus est scire quam primum vis
I just didn't know what else to do	Ego iustus nesciebam quid aliud facere
I can't say what it was	Non possum dicere quid esset
I had to do something now	Ego quoque nunc aliquid
I didn't know this well	Hoc bene non scivi
I see nothing why this is so.	Nihil video cur id ita sit.
I am the one from	Ego ille ille de
I know you know what to do	Scio te scire quid facere
I can't even think of what I will do	Non possum etiam cogitare quid facturus sit
I must be here with you.	Ego hic apud te esse debeo.
I haven't seen that much lately	Quod nuper non vidi multum
I can't even say it	Non possum etiam dicere
I don't even want	Non quidem vis
I just was here to live	Ego iustus erat hic vivere
I like this one a lot	Mihi placet hoc unum multum
I could not understand what it is	Non potui intelligere quid sit
I can say the truth	Verum possum dicere
We do it now more than ever.	Facere id nobis quam nunc semper.
I know what you are doing	Scio quid facit
And I am also a good man.	Et mihi quoque vir bonus est.
It is important to do great things.	Aliquam sit amet magna magna.
I really want to see it from him	Ego vere vis videre eam ex eo
However, he wanted him to be of assistance to him.	Tamen voluit eum sibi auxilio esse.
I can't talk anymore either.	Non possum amplius dicere, vel.
I certainly love it	Ego certe amo eam
I have to find it.	Habeo invenire eam.
But we can't get it right.	Sed bene habere non possumus.
That's how it was gonna be.	Ut sit amet dictum quam.
I didn't want to help her	Nolui auxilium suum
I can't live with me after this	Post hoc non possum vivere mecum
But that is the time.	Sed id tempus est.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
He doesn't like it.	Qui non vult eam.
Never before had anyone told me about this	Numquam ante quis mihi de hoc
I am so happy this year	Ego tam felix hoc anno
I think you can go home now	Puto te nunc domum potes
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
No one thinks.	Nulla putat.
I have only you both	Habeo solum tibi utrumque
I don't mean to be.	Non vult esse.
And the boy is doing well!	Et puer bene facit!
I think it would be good for you	Puto fore ut bene sit tibi
What to do.	Quod facere.
I know you can hear me	Scio me potes audire
I know you love her and she loves you	Scio te eam et amat te
I have great things to do	Habeo magna quae facere
I'll say it again.	Dicam iterum.
So it is.	Ita est.
You can't go home.	Domum ire non potes.
And yet he could not leave.	Et tamen se relinquere non potuit.
Why? 	Quare?
He looked great.	Vidit magna.
He is my father.	Pater meus est.
Yes, it was not.	Etiam non erat.
It didn't take long for me to win.	Non me diu vincere.
I can't deal with it now	Non possum agere cum non nunc
People have seen you.	Homines vidi te.
You can't stay here much longer.	Hic multo diutius manere non potes.
I feel for something	Sentio ad aliquid
I need this so much.	Hoc tantum mihi opus est.
I saw him again.	Iterum vidi eum.
And he was, and still is.	Et erat, et adhuc est.
I really want you to tell me	Ego vere volo te non indicavit mihi
That man can only get so much	Quod homo non potest tantum accipere tantum
I need to do something	Mihi opus est ad aliquid faciendum
I could still talk to him	Adhuc potui loqui ei
Yes it is fun than no.	Etiam sit amet quam nulla.
That's what I didn't know.	Id nesciebam.
But this is not possible.	Sed hoc fieri non potest.
It is likely that this will happen soon.	Verisimile est hoc mox futurum esse.
I can't think of this now	Non possum cogitare de hoc modo
The situation is fine.	Bene se res habet.
I wonder if this has happened	Miror si hoc factum est
That it is so, yes.	Quod ita sit, etiam.
The dog is gone.	Canis abiit.
Please do this.	Quaeso te hoc.
But now we can do nothing about this.	Sed nunc nihil de hoc facere possumus.
But this is the question.	Sed hoc est quaestio.
You'd better be there too.	Ibi etiam melius velis.
The time has come now.	Tempus nunc venit.
But still for the same thing.	Sed adhuc ad id ipsum.
I am thinking	Ego sum cogitas
At some time	In tempus aliquam.
I hope to find out some help.	Spero fore ut ex aliquo adiuvet.
I don't know what it is	Nescio quid ita est
i'm lucky.	Sum felix.
I need to go now	Mihi opus est ut nunc
I hope everything gets better soon.	Spero omnia melius cito.
Certainly it will never happen.	Certe nunquam futurum est.
I don't think you need that.	Non puto opus esse.
I want to hear what you say	Volo audire te dicere
he did not understand.	non intellexit.
I don't want this to happen.	Nolo id fieri.
How it was done.	Quomodo factum est.
He refused to believe.	Noluit credere.
He even said he didn't want to.	Etiam nec dictum velit.
You know this could be good for me.	Scis hoc posse mihi bonum esse.
I want them all here now	Volo omnes hic nunc
I want to see all of it some day	Volo videre omnes ex eo aliquo die
I've done better	Ego feci melius
But he's a little more.	Sed ille paulo plus.
But he did not wish to be seen in this way.	Noluit autem sic videri.
i think this is good	Puto hoc est bonum
I hope both are well	Bene spero utrumque
Never spend a lot of time.	Numquam multum temporis.
He already understood this to himself.	Iam sibi hoc intellexit.
She could do everything.	Posset omnia facere.
It was my job.	Meum erat officium.
You are so good.	Sic bonus es.
I doubt the truth of it	Verum ab eo, dubito
I do something for you, you do something for me	aliquid tibi facio, tu mihi aliquid facis
When he did not.	Quando non fecit.
He was also a great man.	Etiam quis magna erat.
no one speaks.	nemo loquitur.
I wish I could stay longer together	Utinam diutius manere simul
I do as quickly as I said	Facio cito sicut dixit
Look what's happened here.	Vide quid hic acciderit.
I don't want to do it at all	Non vult facere omnino
He knew all that he thought.	Omnia sciebat, quae putabat.
I know how they are	Scio quomodo sunt
I need a lot of time alone	Multum temporis opus est solum
Yep as good as possible	Vidi ut bonus fieri
I'm glad you did.	Gaudeo te fecisse.
I need to understand it	Mihi opus est ad eam intelligere
I know you didn't want to come here, but you have.	Scio te huc venire noluisse sed habes.
I know you.	Scio te.
I have nothing that you can see	Nihil habeo, quod videre potes
To him or not to him.	Ut vel non ipsum.
Now I don't get any.	Nunc non aliquam quam.
He still didn't understand what he meant.	Adhuc non intellexit quid vellet.
I gave up trying to find	Et dedit invenire conatur
I can't do it anymore	Non possum facere posse
I don't want to stay longer	Nolo manere diutius
It would seem that you do not have.	Videtur quod non habes.
He was not here.	Hic non erat.
But he wants to do so.	Velit sed id.
And he	Et ille .
I'm not sure someone else.	Non sum certus aliquis.
I'm speaking the truth	Ego aliquid verum loqui
I will do the same.	Idem faciam.
I forgot I was still there	Oblitus eram adhuc ibi
i want it.	eam volo.
I saw him in the afternoon.	Post meridiem illum vidi.
No one said yes	Nemo dixit sic
I thought so too.	Ita etiam cogitavi.
It didn't take long to find it.	Non diu eam invenire.
But not well.	Sed non bene.
I knew exactly what I could do	Prorsus sciebam quid posset
don't do something like that again.	Non aliquid simile hoc iterum.
I haven't been on time	Et non fuit de tempore
I also know	Ego quoque scio
I can do it if u want	Si vis facere possum
I don't know why it wasn't.	nescio cur non fuit.
Only this, nothing more.	Tantum hoc, nihil amplius.
That is very important.	Id ipsum est, sit amet.
which he did today.	quae hodie fecit.
Certainly I am.	Certe ego sum.
But we have a fixed plan.	Sed certum consilium habemus.
He would not.	Noluit.
You don't want, really	Non vis, vere
I can certainly help you with that	Non possum certe tibi cum illo
We can accept both, as he said.	Utrumque possumus accipere, sicut dixit.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I could hardly hear it	Vix eam audire potui
I hope you don't get sick	Spero autem non male
Too bad why not	Nimis cur non essem
I believe this to be	Hoc credo esse
I'll post one.	Faciam te post unum.
I heard and thought	Audivi et cogitavi
All is well, so far.	Omnia bene, tantum.
I wanted him, but it was already too late	Eum volui, sed iam sero erat
Yes that's great.	Etiam id magna.
I know what I need to do	Scio quid mihi opus sit facere
But this time itself.	Sed id tempus ipsum.
Do it in your own time.	Fac in suo tempore.
I wish that this was true.	Utinam id verum sit.
We need to understand	Hoc opus est intelligere
I don't really know who it was	Non vere scio quis esset
I can't see him.	Eum videre non possum.
He does great things today.	Hodie magna facit.
that says something	Quod dicit aliquid
Not yesterday, not tomorrow, but today.	Non heri, non cras, sed hodie.
But never with me.	Sed nunquam mecum.
I will try to like	Ego similis ei probabile
But that's not even about work.	Sed ne id quidem fere opus est.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
The boy was not so lucky.	Sic puer felix non erat.
He always knows what time is.	Semper novit quid tempus sit.
shortly after I was home.	paulo post domi essem.
for never.	numquam enim.
I wanted to have a good time with him	Volui habere bonum tempus cum eo
I'm not a boy anymore.	Puer non sum amplius.
Last year was good.	Proximo anno bonus fuit.
I don't believe this happened.	Id factum non credo.
I've been through so much	Per tantum fui
Men you know.	Homines scis.
I wanted to stay with him	Volui manere cum eo
She's already said that.	Illa iam dixit.
Lucky to have him.	Felix habere eum.
But not only.	Sed non nisi.
I didn't know what else to say	Ego nesciebam quid aliud dicere
But he could not do this.	Sed hoc facere non potuit.
But it is also likely.	Sed etiam verisimile est.
We have scarcely anything yet before us.	Vix adhuc res ante nos habemus.
He used to do that.	Esse solebat, qui faceret.
However, he could not find much.	Tamen multum invenire non potuit.
I can't even do anything that's done	Non possum etiam aliquid aliquid quod factum est
Now I want you to come	Nunc volo te venire
It was never, and never will be.	Numquam fuit, et numquam erit.
Don't do anything more.	Ne quid amplius.
So glad to have you here!	Ita gaudeo te hic habere!.
It was my room.	Cubiculum meum erat.
Which is good.	Quod bonum est.
And it was this.	Erat autem hoc.
It was a big one for him at the time.	Erat quis magna eius tempore.
This has nothing to do with me.	Hoc nihil ad me.
I didn't know why this was	Nesciebam cur hoc esset
I need more than	Mihi opus est plus quam
Maybe you already had.	Fortasse iam habuit.
Probably too much.	Verisimiliter nimium.
There you have it.	Ibi non habes.
Yes, there was no one else.	Etiam nec aliquam erat.
This is your first time.	Hoc primum tuum est.
I want to deal with him	Volo agere cum eo
That's to give and receive.	Id dare et accipere.
I told him.	ei dixi.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
I hope all is well with you	Spero bene tibi
I don't need to see it again.	Non opus est videre illud.
He didn't really want her.	Noluit eam vere velle.
He would not listen to us.	Noluit audire nos.
He loves what he does.	Amat quod agit.
He wanted to know why.	Cur vellet.
He was always in it.	In id semper erat.
I don't want to do that	Nolo facere quod
But that was it.	Sed id erat est.
I need to do something for her	Mihi opus est ad eam aliquid
All but one.	Omnes, sed unus.
Tonight only about you, not me.	Hac nocte tantum de te, non me.
I didn't know her	Ego nesciebam eam uxorem
Never, never.	Numquam, numquam.
Not after this.	Non post hoc.
I can help you.	Te adiuvare possum.
I tried to love him.	Conatus est ipsum.
I don't doubt it.	Ita non dubito.
I can't be a man again	Iterum homo non possum esse
And he was alone.	Et solus erat.
I thought you better know	Cogitavi melius scire
Everything now.	Omnia nunc.
Please try something that's been said.	Aliquam id dictum velit.
I don't know what's here	Nescio quid hic
It's made for you.	Tibi suus fecit.
But also out loud.	Sed et magna ex.
I absolutely love this.	Omnino hic amo.
This is not working for me.	Hoc mihi non opus est.
Yes to me.	Sic mihi.
For a long time.	Diutius.
Everyone probably does.	Probabiliter omnes facit.
Not only the same, but the same.	Non tantum idem, sed idem.
We can't act like it's not done.	Non possumus agere sicut factum non est.
It was time to have everything.	Tempus erat omnia habere.
Three days only.	Tres tantum dies.
Help you today.	Te adiuvet hodie.
I have something more	Ego plus aliquid
I saw me again	Vidi iterum me
I have someone to talk to about this.	Habeo aliquem loqui de hoc.
Now I need to talk to you	Nunc opus est tibi loqui
Where i was yesterday.	Ubi heri eram.
No one can hear you.	Nemo te audire potest.
not her.	Non eam.
I'm enough for one day	Ego satis per unum diem
But now we are all.	Sed nunc omnes sumus.
He can do both.	Utrumque potest.
He could not do this.	Hoc facere potuit.
I never wanted that to happen	Numquam volui quod futurum est
He loves	Amat.
But not after him.	Sed nec ipsum post.
i think she probably know what	Puto eam probabiliter scire quid
But that was it.	Sed id erat enim.
i think this is good	Puto hoc bonum est
I don't believe you for a long time.	Non credo diu.
Not so much this year.	Non ita hoc anno.
It was finally done.	Tandem factum est.
He knew for sure.	Sciebat certe.
I could get it wrong again	Non potui ut illud malum iterum
there he was, there he was.	ibi fuit, ibi fuit.
I will not say who you are here	Non dicam quis hic es
and they are good.	et bona sunt.
I need to get to you	Mihi opus est ut ad te
Not yet	Non tamen
I really wanted to travel again	Ego vere voluit iter iterum
I know more than I think	Scio plus quam cogitat
Much better.	Multo melius.
After him I think of it	Post eum puto eam
But not much for you.	Sed non multum tibi.
Well, it's good.	Bene, bonum ei.
I can't deal with it	Non possum agere cum illo
Perhaps you are.	Tu fortasse.
I'll take a look today.	Vide hodie Faciam.
That's how that's how.	Ut id quam quam.
Never say that bad.	Numquam id malum.
He could do it.	Posset facere.
It was good, but not enough.	Bonum erat, sed non satis.
That is not the case now.	Quod iam non est.
I am only looking after you	Ego sum solus vultus post te
I wanted to spend more time with you.	Volui plus temporis apud te.
I don't really think anything of it	Non vere cogitare aliquid ex eo
I want to get home as much as we can	Volo domum quantum possumus
I just want you to know	Ego iustus volo te scire
I don't see the need to stay longer	Non video opus me diutius manere
The problem is the problem.	Rem quaestionem.
I feel really good about that	Sentio vere bonum quod
I just had to get out there	Ego iustus erat ut ex ibi
He does this well, really, really well.	Hoc bene, vere, vere bene facit.
I don't see what's really wrong	Non vide quid vere mali est
You can do this.	Hoc facere potes.
There was nothing that he knew.	Nihil erat quod sciebat.
And this was good.	Et hoc erat bonum.
I just don't have.	Modo non habet.
There was no way to wish it.	Nulla ut erat velit.
Something to do.	Aliquid facere.
Do not do it, if you are time or time.	Ne facias, si tempus es, vel temporis.
I can't leave her alone	Non possum solus non solum eam relinquere
I could not give it.	Non potui ei dare.
I could not do more.	Non potui amplius facere.
I hope that doesn't come	Spero autem quod non venit
I don't see it like this.	Non video sic.
already mentioned.	iam dictum est.
But you only want to be yourself.	Sed solus vis ut sis ipse.
Thirty perhaps.	Triginta fortasse.
You're not busy.	Non es occupatus.
I'm sorry I didn't do anything for you	Ego non te aliquid facere te paenitet
You can't do anything for me.	Mihi aliquid facere non potes.
Nothing, probably, but I don't like it.	Nihil, probabiliter, sed non placet.
I wanted to tell you	Volui tibi dicere
But this is one thing.	Sed hoc aliud est.
I never met him.	Numquam occurrit ei.
I never thought it would be	Numquam putavi fore
That time is gone.	Quod tempus abiit.
I like him very much	Ego amo illum valde
Everything is great.	Omnia magna.
I was there when his father was there.	Ibi eram cum pater eius ibi eram.
I wanted help.	auxilium volui.
I hope it's soon.	Spero mox est.
.	.
I said of the night	Dixi de nocte
But not so hard.	Sed non ita difficile.
I could not see why I could not stay longer	Non potui videre quare diutius manere non potuit
Go make someone.	Ire fac aliquem.
But neither.	Sed nec.
I feel really good right now	Sentio vere nunc bonum
I hope you have a good day.	Spero te habere bonum diem.
I thought that would happen.	Putavi fore.
I am not surprised	Non miror
I want you to stay here	Volo te hic manere
Now don't get any no.	Nunc non aliquam nulla.
I know you love me more than anyone	Scio me plus quam quis amat
You just tried to help me.	Vos iustus conatus ad auxilium me.
But he made the decision easy for me.	Consilium verum mihi facile fecit.
i have been three.	fui tres.
He owes me nothing.	Mihi nihil debet.
Nothing sorry.	Nihil paenitet.
I don't want it to me like this	Nolo eam ad me sic
He knew that.	Sciebat.
Good attempt, but not quite yet	Conatus bonus, sed non admodum adhuc
It can't be anything.	Non potest aliquid esse.
I know him really well	Scio eum vere bene
I need to hear everything from her	Mihi opus est audire omnia ex eius
Believe in something.	Credere in aliquid.
I don't care when I do this	Nolo quando hoc facit
Do that very well.	Fac ut optime.
I don't even know time	Non quidem scio tempore
My father has the same thing	Pater meus idem habet
I could not be there	Non potui ibi esse
I can't say for sure now	Non possum dicere certe nunc
But what do I know.	Sed quid scio.
I know not what you like	Scio non quod libet
Not much with me	Non multum mecum
I can do and win	Non possum facere et vincere
Just come over me	Modo venit in me
THAT'S ALL.	SIC omnes.
I did not	Non feci
I doubt if I will do it.	Dubito si quid facturus sit.
I don't think you would do that.	Non puto te facturum esse.
I just don't want to make money.	Modo pecuniam facere non vult.
I'll go to your room	Ego te ad cubiculum tuum
We are well, we are well.	Bene sumus, bene sumus.
I can't believe it hasn't happened	Non possum credere quod iam non est factum
I never understood.	Numquam intellexit.
I can give you a good time	Non possum dare tibi tempus bonum
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
He does one thing, he does not.	Hoc unum facit, hoc non facit.
I know you're with him	Scio te esse cum eo
That's how it is.	Ut id quam est.
Even this week.	Vel hac septimana.
him, him, him.	ipsum, ipsum, ipsum.
But we can do nothing about this.	Sed de hoc nihil possumus.
I really don't want to talk about this	Ego vere non vis loqui de hoc
I told myself at the moment	Dixi ipse in tempore
I want to go to him so badly	Volo ire ad eum tam male
He is only a boy.	Puer tantum est.
I hope you find what you need.	Spero te invenire quod tibi opus est.
This is us.	Hic est nos.
Yes we also.	Ita nos etiam.
But he wants only that.	Sed velit nisi ut.
I just didn't know what it was	Modo nesciebat quid esset
I'm just trying to understand	Ego iustus conatur intelligere
but I certainly don't	ego autem, certe non
I don't want to like it	Ego similis ei non vis
I think that is important	Puto quod sit amet
I never thought but probably	Numquam cogitavi, sed probabiliter
I told you that before	Dixi vobis quod ante
You did not.	Non fecisti.
Tonight if you can.	Hac nocte si potes.
Enough to think about it already.	Satis iam de illa cogitare.
It made him want more.	Plus ei vis fecit.
It's fine too.	Bene est etiam.
Maybe you can, but this is not for me.	Fortasse potes sed hoc non est mihi.
I will do it myself, if he is a man.	Ipse me, si vir est, faciam.
And you too can.	Et tu quoque potes.
You might be happy.	Forsitan felix.
as he himself	sicut ipse.
If not, do not.	Si non est, noli facere.
I can't hear anything	Non possum audire aliquid
I don't think it is the same now.	Non puto idem nunc esse.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
It's too late.	Nimis sero est.
Maybe that's how.	Aliquam id est quam.
I did and got it	Ego feci et obtinuit hoc
I couldn't be that man anymore	Quod homo non potui amplius
And there he is again.	Et ibi iterum est.
There is no need to do this.	Non opus est hoc facere.
You don't want to do this.	Hoc facere non vis.
I am not alone	Non sum ego solus
I just didn't want	Ego iustus noluit
I hope someone knows what to do	Spero aliquis scit quid facere
Well, there was never really time.	Bene, nunquam fuit tempus vere.
I don't want to think anymore.	Nolo amplius cogitare.
We are not, but we are.	Non sumus, sed sumus.
I bought for me	Ego emit pro me
I could not be able to	Non potui non posse
And it	Et illud.
I wish this was mine	Utinam hic meus
No not from this.	Nulla non ex hoc.
But the father did not give.	Sed pater non dedit.
It's really good to see you.	Est vere bonum te videre.
It can't even be good.	Non potest vel bonum esse.
You don't stop.	Tu noli prohibere.
Now he did not understand the matter.	Iam rem non intellexit.
Not that kind.	Non id genus.
I don't need it yet.	Non opus est tamen.
That they had been.	Fuisse id.
Absolutely.	Prorsus.
He said nothing.	Nihil dixit.
Yes that's how.	Etiam id quam.
I just can't understand him	Non solum non potest eum intelligere
Maybe someone was there.	Ibi fortasse aliquis fuit.
I don't know where he went	Nescio quo abiit
He just said	Non tantum dixit
I know what he means.	quid sibi velit scio.
Yes, it's gonna be great.	Etiam sit amet magna est.
He thinks a lot about you.	Multum de te cogitat.
This one is.	Hic unus est.
Pretty much,!.	Satis multum, !.
i think it is for you	Puto non est tibi
I guess we can live long	Suspicor diu vivere possumus
I want her hug	Volo eam amet
But in this there was but little.	Verum in hoc parum fuit.
I saw what I wanted.	Vidi quod voluit.
But that is the time.	Sed id tempus est.
But I just had something to do.	Modo aliquid facere cum sed.
It was not bad.	Non erat malum.
Tell me what is true and what is not.	Dic quid verum sit, quid non.
He can think of nothing else.	Nihil aliud potest cogitare.
No one is talking about him.	Nemo est de illo.
There's a lot of work to be happy.	Non multum opus est ut felix sit.
I believe him.	ei credo.
I could still do everything in	Non potui tamen omnia in
Not very long.	Non multum diu.
the father said.	pater dixit.
You can help me.	Potes me adiuvare.
I thought it would be ut	Putavi fore ut
I can't see it, not yet	Non possum videre eum, non tamen
He thought it to be true.	Putabat verum esse.
You do what you do well.	Quod bene facis, facis.
I will stay at home	Ego autem domi manere
I like what you want so much	Mihi placet quod vis tantum
He told me the same thing.	Id ipsum mihi dixit.
I feel this about you	Hoc sentio de te
Well that's not true at all.	Bene quod omnino verum non est.
It was just this way.	Iustus erat hoc modo.
I could not do it	Non potui hoc facere ei
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
He understood her.	Intellexit eam.
I just want to see it	Ego iustus volo videre eam
I want it too, which is my first time	illud etiam volo, quod mihi primum est
We have enough of this.	Satis de hoc habemus.
I'm ready to use it	Ego paratus sum ut eam
Maybe I should not be able to do this.	Forsitan ne hoc facere possit.
I am not happy.	Non sum felix.
I am too happy	Ego quoque felix
I won't be here	Ego ne hic sit
I just can't make another decision	Ego iustus non facere aliud consilium
I have to go to work	Habeo ut ad opus
There's nothing in it.	Nulla in est.
Which indeed is so.	Quod quidem ita est.
He is a good man.	Vir bonus est.
You're not yet ready to think about it.	Nondum cogitare de eo paratus es.
Never think to do this	Nunquam puto hoc facere
I didn't know for sure	Ego nesciebam pro certo
He never said a thing.	Numquam rem dixit.
Usually, but not enough.	Fere, sed non satis.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
I think there is something else to it	Puto esse aliquid aliud ad eam
But that's now.	Sed id nunc.
I'm glad it's fixed.	Gaudeo certum est.
And he did the work.	Et fecit opus.
You can only learn it.	Tu modo id scire potes.
I haven't been long enough.	Satis diu non fui.
To do so please.	Ut id velit.
We can do everything in a day.	Non possumus omnia in die facere.
But no one wants him.	Sed velit ipsum nulla.
I think you are great	Puto te esse valde
But still nothing.	Sed tamen nihil.
Maybe it may help	Forsitan ut adiuvet
I know I didn't have it but I did	Scio non habere, sed fecit
And he did it.	Et fecit.
He was certain to me.	Mihi certum erat.
There was a need to talk to him.	Loqui ei opus erat.
I tried to think about what's happened	Conatus sum cogitare quid acciderit
I wasn't sure that	Non eram certus quod
not too well.	Non nimium bene.
Maybe that's great.	Aliquam id magna est.
I really don't think anything happened between us	Ego vere non cogitare aliquid inter nos factum
Me to you	Mihi ad te
I have to do this for you.	Ego sum ut hoc faciam tibi.
I like it but that's it.	Placet esse id nisi.
In his statement.	In eius dictum est.
It was too soon.	Nimis cito erat.
It is important to be great.	Aliquam sit amet magna.
Well, that is.	Bene, id est.
Even in the future.	Etiam in futurum erat.
I'll do that for him.	Faciam ut pro eo.
I really appreciate all you have done for me	Ego vere bene omnia quae fecisti mihi
To be well	Ut bene sit
No one said too much.	Nemo nimium dixit.
This was necessary.	Hoc opus erat.
I don't know how to say this.	Nescio quomodo hoc dicam.
I'm always here	Ego semper hic
There will be something	Ibi erit quod
This was easy enough.	Id satis facile erat.
We have no plan.	Consilium non habemus.
We need you to see what's next	Non opus est tibi videre quod in proximo est
Now that's none other than.	Nunc id nulla nisi.
I really wanted to see what you have	Ego vere volui videre quid habes
I know you've always been your good	Scio te semper fuisse bonum tuum
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum est.
I'm happy to talk to her	Sum felix loqui eam
But there was only one.	Sed non erat nisi.
He said that he wanted to come.	Dixit se velle venire.
i am still out of time	Ego etiam ex tempore
I can't see anything here	Non possum videre quicquam hic rem
But he thought better of it.	Sed melius ex eo putavit.
I already know what up	Ego iam quid usque
His dad used to play with me.	Pater eius mecum ludere solebat.
as I told you.	ut dixi vobis.
Can anyone help me.	Potest quis me adiuvet.
Now there is another.	Nunc aliud est.
I didn't want to have to do this	Nolui habere hoc facere
She is very kind.	Valde genus est.
I had no time to think this through all	Tempus non habui cogitare hoc per omnia
No one wants that great.	Nulla id magna velit.
I don't care for him	Nolo pro eo
It was hard for me to understand.	Mihi difficile erat intelligere.
As time goes by.	Ut tempus sit.
I don't want to be anything.	Nolo esse aliquid.
As it was.	Ut erat.
You need someone to be able to trust you.	Opus est aliquem, te posse credere.
And not again.	Et ne iterum.
I know who you want now	Scio qui vis nunc
I will probably do it this year.	Verisimile hoc anno faciam.
I'll tell you if something like that happened	Dicam tibi, si aliquid simile factum est
I just wanted to be alone to think	Ego iustus solus esse voluit, cogitare
I am one and one	Ego sum unus et unus est
I could not live without you	Non potui vivere nec sine te
I hope that	Spero autem quod
We are all one.	Omnes unum sumus.
I had a really hard time	Ego quoque vere difficile tempus
I only need it	Me solum opus est
I don't want to see it	Nolo videre illud
I need to talk to him	Mihi opus est loqui ei
i am satisfied with this	Ego satis de hoc
And not again	Et non iterum:
I want you to come with me	Volo te venire mecum
I can do this through	Per hoc facere possum
But not from the same thing.	Sed non ex id ipsum.
That was not his job.	Quod eius officium non fuit.
But that was the time.	Sed id tempus erat.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
I didn't want to go to this	Nolui ire in hoc
He is not here indeed.	Non est hic quidem.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
I believe I want more.	plus me velle credo me.
That's up to the problem.	Id est ad quaestionem.
But what you want is not likely.	Sed id quod vis non est verisimile.
It's the future.	Est futurum.
But it is good.	Sed bonum est.
I don't want to talk about that	Non vis loqui quod
You don't need to be friends.	Non necesse est esse amicos.
One time only.	Unum tempus, nisi.
And you'd better.	Et melius velis.
I don't know what's going to happen to me.	Nescio quid mihi futurum sit.
Now that's something.	Nunc id est aliquid.
That's going to happen.	Quod futurum est.
He didn't want me.	Noluit me.
He came in.	In venit.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
She could not stop herself.	Illa se prohibere non posset.
But this indeed is possible.	Sed hoc quidem potest.
I think this would be.	Hoc puto fore.
I can't say everything	Non possum dicere omnia
I need to know if you've done this	Opus est scire, si tu hoc factum est
That's enough to do.	Satis id facerem.
I never thought I could	Numquam putavi posse
I'm glad to be in you.	Gaudeo quod in es.
Plus he was really good.	Plus erat vere bonus.
It is probable that he said.	Probabile esse dixit.
I can't let anyone in	Non possum ne quis in
I know that's very good	Scio quod valde bona
That was good for us.	Illa nobis bona fuit.
I had something else	Ego quoque aliquid aliud
I don't know what this means	Nescio quid hoc modo
I don't like it much.	Mihi non multum placet.
I have no problem with that.	Habeo nulla quaestio cum id.
I wanted it to be me.	Volui eam ut me.
I don't really know why I would like to come	Non vere scio cur vellem venire
but probably also understood.	sed probabiliter etiam intellexit.
I thought something was wrong with you.	Aliquid mali cogitavi tecum.
I don't know how.	Nescio quomodo.
Yes it is, it should be here.	Ita est, hic esse debet.
I did that with you today	Ego feci ut apud te hodie
I know better than non	Scio melius quam non
I can't speak for sure	Non possum dicere pro certo
I made my decision	Ego feci consilium meum
But the time was only.	Sed tempus erat nisi.
I wanted to get everything together	Volui ad omnia simul
What he can't do.	Quod facere non potest.
I can't think about everything	Non possum cogitas omnia
What he told me was done	Quod dixit me factum esse
He loves you too.	Te quoque amat.
I don't even know him.	Ego ne ipsum quidem novi.
I still think this is true.	Ego tamen hoc verum puto.
I thought you'd like to hear	Cogitavi velis audire
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
I did this before	Ego hoc ante
I knew we won't be here much for a long time	Sciebam nos non multum hic esse diu
There are things you just know.	Sunt quae tu modo scis.
I want to stay here.	hic manere volo.
I need a real meal soon	Ad primum opus est verum prandium sum
What time.	Quod tempus.
He would do his best to do so.	Suum id optime facturum.
I wanted to have everything about him	Volui habere omnia de eo
He likes to do it.	Velit ut facere.
I wanted to say I didn't understand	Volui dicere non intellexit
I don't want to be able to talk.	Nolo loqui posse.
I never want to see it.	Numquam vis videre eam.
It's a difficult time.	Est tempus difficile.
if you please.	si placet.
I don't mean not to do it.	Non vult non facere.
Which one is the nearest.	Quae proxima est.
I just want some time for me	Ego iustus volo aliquo tempore mihi
We need to see you soon	Non opus est tibi cito videre
There is no way.	Non est iter.
He really seems to know them all.	Ille vere videtur scire omnes.
But not for him.	Sed non ipsum enim.
This certainly means a lot to me.	Hoc certe multum est ad me.
But he does not say much.	Sed hoc non multum dicit.
I will probably not be home tonight	Ego probabiliter nocte non erit in domum suam
We have quite a little as described above.	Parum habemus satis sicut dictum est.
It is the same with me.	Simile est apud me.
I've been traveling.	Ego erat iter.
I don't know what to say.	Nescio quidem quid dicam.
But at last something came.	Sed tandem aliquid venit.
I know exactly what to do to help you	Prorsus scio quid faciam ut adiuvet te
Today I feel good, happy	Hodie sentio bonus, felix
Boy, always.	Puer, semper.
This journey is for you.	Hic iter tibi faciendum est.
I can't even see what's there	Non possum etiam videre quid ibi
I want you to stay there	Volo te manere illuc
You did not forget.	Oblitus non es.
I was not happy.	Non eram felix.
She must stop.	Illa debet prohibere.
I could not understand how I knew	Non potui intelligere quomodo sciebam
How to love yourself.	Quam ipsum.
That's what made it good	Id quod factum est bonum
You can only see.	Modo videre potes.
and must have.	et habere debet.
But still he did it.	Sed tamen fecit.
I just wasn't sure what it was	Ego iustus non certus quod esset
I'm ready to go now.	Paratus sum nunc ire.
He wanted to come.	Venire voluit.
But neither is he willing.	Sed nec est velit.
I want to see if she is home	Volo videre si est in domum suam
He went to his house.	Domum eius abiit.
I need to sit longer	Mihi opus est ut diutius sit
It's really bad.	Malum est vere.
And he does it.	Et facit.
i don't know what to do.	quid faciam nescio.
Time got better.	Melius tempus obtinuit.
This class is gone	Hoc genus abiit
I am the same to her	Idem sum ad eam
I just can't do it	Ego iustus facere non posse
I don't mean to do this.	Non vult hoc facere.
I don't know why.	Nescio cur.
he was still scared.	vix adhuc erat.
Get good advice	Ut bene consilium
Now I need it.	Nunc opus est.
I like you very much	Ego amo te valde
I like it much better	Mihi placet multo melius
And it is.	Et est.
I'm going to stop you	Ego te ad prohibere
I want you some more	Volo tibi aliquid plus
That is.	Ille est.
yes no no great.	Etiam non nulla magna.
The matter is so.	Ita res est.
I can say great things.	Dicere possum magna.
There is no problem.	Non est quaestio.
Almost no one did it.	Nemo fere id fecit.
I hope that's all	Spero autem quod omnia
I've never been like this with you!	Numquam sic tecum fui!
It is not so.	Non ita est.
I know this is true of myself.	Hoc de me verum scio.
I just want you to know what happened	Ego iustus volo te scire quid factum est
Get help with	Ut cum auxilio
both of them have been.	utrumque fui.
I will tell you how to do this	Dicam tibi quomodo hoc facere
I made myself at home	Ego feci me domi
I forgot I wasn't up to it	Oblitus eram tibi non ad eam
When he does this, let him not be himself.	Quod cum facit, ne sit ipse.
I don't need someone to be there	Non opus est ut aliquis ibi
I told him everything	Dixi ei omnia
And that is good.	Et illud bonum est.
Not to be.	Non esse.
I need to know him more	Mihi opus est scire eum amplius
You are with us.	Apud nos es.
I also know what is good and what is bad	ego quoque scio quid sit bonum et quid malum
I think being a teacher is a very important job	Puto esse magister est ipsum officium
But it was not at all true.	Sed non erat omnino verum.
I knew this was going to be really good.	Hic sciebam vere bonum futurum.
Or it may seem like this.	Vel sic videri.
I just can't get it	Ego iustus non potest accipere
I know it's the same for you	Scio idem est tibi
i think there will be some more	Puto fore aliquid amplius
I am always indebted to you	Ego semper debeo
You can still play.	Ludere adhuc potes.
As was said before.	Ut dictum erat ante.
I never wanted a big house	Ego numquam volui domum magna
Look better too.	Vide melius etiam.
A lot of time to do	Multum temporis facere
I want it so bad now	Volo eam ita mali nunc
But finally.	Sed tandem.
How do you not sit	Ut tibi non sit
They truly are.	Vere sunt.
I saw myself.	Vidi ipse.
I hope you don't come home at all	Spero non venit in domum suam omnino
You are not.	Non es tu.
I just can't.	Modo non possum.
I have a job for her	Habeo officium pro suo
I do everything for you	Omnia facio tibi
I can talk when you do	Possum dicere cum facis
I really just wanted to be his wife	Ego vere iustus voluit esse suam uxorem
I don't even think so.	Ego ne id quidem puto.
I can see it coming this way	Hoc modo videre possum venire eam
To him there was nothing.	Ei nihil erat.
Which again is nothing.	Quod iterum nihil est.
I never heard anything like it before	Numquam ante aliquid simile audivi
I had three this year.	tres eo anno habui.
I said I'm still alive	Dixi me adhuc vivere
I have to have you now	Habeo habere te nunc
I want you to have this now	Volo enim vos habere hoc modo
It will not be.	Non erit.
That's the game.	Id est velit.
I can't believe what you want to do	Non possum credere quod velis facere
He knew this.	Hoc scivit.
I told him that way now	Dixi eum illuc nunc
It is necessary to do so.	Facere necesse est.
Or it was.	Vel fuit.
He does not act in a certain way.	Non modo certo agit.
I want you to stay	Volo te et manere
This is your plan.	Tuum consilium est.
I was sure.	Certus eram.
I will not do it for you.	Non faciam tibi.
But you didn't really say you were coming today.	Sed vere non dixisti hodie te venire.
But now who you are.	Sed nunc quis es.
I really feel very sorry for him	Ego vere sentio valde pro eo
If he ever did the same thing.	Si umquam hoc idem fecerit.
I just want to see it	Ego iustus volo video vidi eam
He did not like him.	Nolebat eum.
Now I am good.	Nunc bonus sum.
I can't get it.	Non possum hoc accipere.
But he does.	Sed agit.
Look no further on him.	Nihil de eo vide.
But that's enough for the money.	Sed hoc satis est ad pecuniam.
Without this there is nothing.	Sine hoc nihil est.
Hard things to do	Res difficile facere
I don't even think about it	Non quidem cogitare de illo
I want not to be like this	Volo non esse sic
I can't see it for me	Non possum videre quod ad me
I don't really think about it much for the time	Non vere cogitare de illo quantum ad tempus
He loves me not.	Me non amat.
I didn't know what	Nesciebam quid
by both.	per utrumque.
I need to get you morning and night	Opus est ut te mane et nocte
i'm busy.	Sum occupatus.
I want you to find it	Volo te invenire eam
It is mine.	Meum est.
Have a very good time	Non habere ipsum tempus bonum
He likes it.	Velit eam.
But no more than that.	Sed nec ipsum quam.
I can do some help now	Non possum facere aliquid auxilium nunc
It is good to speak.	Bonum est loqui.
Who thinks	Quis putat.
I never heard it before	Numquam ante audivi
I never thought of it before	Numquam cogitavi ante
Nothing more.	Nihil amplius.
I am so happy to have him	Ego sum ita felix ut eum
To not be friends.	Ut non amicos.
I don't want her to be here	Non vis eam esse hic
It's easy to make friends.	Facile est amicos facere.
This is what you have to understand.	Hoc est quod habes intelligere.
You don't want to leave us behind	Non vis relinquere nos post
I want to help be with him	Volo auxilio esse cum eo
I was not at the time	Non eram tempore
I don't even know how to do it.	Nescio etiam quomodo id facias.
Not only for me, but for all.	Non solum mihi, sed omnibus.
I thought about that.	Cogitavi de illo.
That was not.	Quod non erat.
I know you find it hard	Scio te hoc difficile invenire
Maybe he's happy.	Fortasse hoc felix est.
I don't care now.	Nolo modo.
He was not even aware of this.	Ne id quidem scire hic erat.
I wasn't even here.	Ne hic quidem eram.
He doesn't want to come here.	Non vult venire huc.
You indeed did.	Tu quidem fecit.
This is my home.	Hoc domi est.
I believe that he will do well.	Credo eum bene facturum esse.
He wants to see me.	Me videre vult.
I want this with you	Hoc volo tecum
That's what I feel	Id quod sentio
He would not even do this.	Ne hoc quidem voluit.
And not so.	Nec sic.
I felt I could not do the job	Certum esse non potui ut faceret officium
What is, he is.	Quid est, ipsum est.
It is the same with me.	Idem mecum est.
I am sure of that.	Certus sum de illo.
I knew he wasn't going to	Sciebam eum non ire
And perhaps that is good.	Et fortasse id bonum est.
Just yesterday on the job.	Sicut heri officium.
It's easy to talk.	Loqui facile est.
I still think that's true	Ego tamen puto quod verum est
I could barely see	Vix potui videre
But he did not do this.	Sed hoc non fecit.
What he does is good.	Bonum est quod facit.
But that was not before.	Sed id non ante.
I just wanted her to stop.	Modo volui eam prohibere.
I don't want it.	Nolo eam.
What he says gets done	Quod dicit sero fieri
Is good.	Bonus est.
I need some time to get something done	Mihi opus est aliquo tempore ad aliquid quod factum est
I've heard it now.	Audivi modo.
This can be both good and bad.	Hoc potest esse et bonum et malum.
So I told you.	Sic ego dixi vobis.
I don't know exactly what he said	Prorsus nescio quid dixit
I don't know where my mom is	Nescio ubi meum, sit
Here are mine.	Hic sunt mea.
I know she loves me.	Scio me amat.
I told her she didn't have	Dixi ei illa non habere
That's what is already in front of the office	Id quod iam ante officium
I'm not here to do it.	Non sum hic facere.
I am getting good at this	Questus sum bonum hoc
Nothing can be done.	Nihil fieri posse.
It's too good.	Nimis bonus est.
Tell him what.	Dic ei quod.
But this.	Sed id.
Who knows what will happen.	Quis scit quid futurum sit.
It will be fine for you.	Bene tibi erit.
There is work.	Est opus.
But also great.	Sed et magna.
I said already to me.	Dixi iam mihi.
I just never realized it before	Ego iustus numquam intellexit ante
It is true.	Verum est.
I thought I know	Putavi scire
I'm always here if I need to talk or anything.	Ego semper hic sum, si loqui vel aliquid necesse est.
You can't buy me.	Me emere non potes.
I need to get things one day at a time	Opus est ut res una die ad tempus
This certainly is not possible.	Id certe fieri non potest.
I'm sorry if this is too hard to hear from you.	Me paenitet si id tibi difficile est audire.
I hope to talk to you again	Spero loqui tecum adhuc
I only have more than one	Ego tantum non plus quam unum
It's not.	Suus 'non.
I don't want to think.	Nolo cogitare.
I know you well enough	Scio te bene satis
I can't believe it just happened	Non possum credere quod sicut factum est
I wanted nothing more than to have him	nihil plus volui quam habere illum
I heard the name	Audivi nomen
It is not difficult nor difficult.	Non difficile, nec difficile.
Look at the truth for you.	Verum tibi vide.
Don't think you have it.	Noli putare eam habere.
To do something for himself and to know	Facturum esse aliquid pro se et scire
I can't say the same thing for me	Non possum dicere idem pro me
says my question.	Dicit quaestio mea.
Tonight, not so.	Hac nocte, non sic.

If all goes well, very well.	Si bene, valde bene.
I always wonder if this is the way.	Miror si semper hoc modo.
He had.	Habuit.
I hope that I met you.	Spero autem quod occurrit vobis.
This often goes well, often even wrongly.	Hoc saepe bene, saepe etiam male.
You'll never win.	Numquam vincere.
I really didn't know	Ego vere nesciebam
At length I did it.	Tandem feci.
It was done in this way.	Factum est hoc modo.
I doubt to see me	Dubito videre me
I can't tell you what to do	Non possum dicere quid facias
I have nothing else to say	Non habeo aliud dicere
I guess we can't go there	Suspicor non possumus ire illuc
No one could find him.	Nemo eum invenire potuit.
Don't listen to me	Me non audire
Too quickly.	Nimis cito.
But it's time for the season.	Aliquam sed tempus ex.
I will tell you what happened.	Quod factum est, dicam tibi.
I didn't think that was true	Non putavi quod verum est
Maybe not at all now.	Aliquam non nulla nunc.
He is gone now.	Abiit modo.
I don't know whether it is true.	Nescio an verum sit.
I've been with him for a long time	Ego illum diu
I couldn't do it	Non potui facere eam
Better as soon as possible.	Melius quam primum.
You haven't seen this already.	Iam hoc tibi non videtur.
No that's no time no.	Nulla id nunc nulla.
He is not here today.	Hic hodie non est.
I guess he is speaking	Suspicor eum loqui
I'm glad to be here.	Gaudeo te hic esse.
I thought about what you said	Cogitavi de quo dixisti
We're fine with you.	Bene tibi sumus.
Well we all have.	Bene nos omnes habemus.
I never could do it	Numquam potuit facere
I like him now	Ego amo illum modo
I wanted to be me again	Iterum me esse volui
I no longer need it	Mihi iam non opus est
Now is not the time.	Nunc non tempus est.
And if possible, how long.	Et si potest, quam diu.
I just want to see what it looks like now	EGO iustus volo video vidi quod spectat sicut nunc
I don't like to see.	Non placet videre.
I want to see you	Ego volo te videre
No, that's not quite right.	Non, id parum recte.
i'm lucky.	Sum felix.
I know you say no	Scio te dicere non
You never said his name.	Numquam nomen eius dixisti.
It is a very difficult job.	Nimis difficile est officium.
They are great.	Magna sunt.
i'm happy for this one	Sum felix ad hoc unum
The father was one.	Pater unus erat.
But that was always.	Sed id semper erat.
I never thought to be with you	Numquam cogitavi ut tecum vel
There are perhaps three.	Fortasse tres sunt.
Yes please.	Ita placet.
I can just leave you like this	Non possum iustus relinquere tibi sic
I know for sure.	Satis certo scio.
I haven't been with anyone else	Non fui cum quis aliud
Yes, it is good.	Ita est, bonum est.
Now, as has been said, it was some, but not great.	Nunc ut dictum est, aliquam erat, sed non magna.
It is important that you are not yourself.	Aliquam sit amet quam non ipsum.
I have done little.	parum id feci.
I need help	Mihi opus est auxilio
I like you too	Ego amo te quoque
I don't know whether this is necessary or not.	Nescio an hoc opus sit vel non.
I'm not gone	Abiit in me non est
Maybe he's here.	Fortasse hic est.
now you need it.	Nunc tibi opus est.
He has not yet.	Nondum habet.
You never know from him.	Numquam ex illum.
It is not likely.	Verisimile non est.
I don't want to say.	Nolo dicere.
I think one of us needs me	Puto unum ex nobis opus est mihi
But perhaps there was nothing to do.	Fortasse verum erat nihil facere.
Now he did not see the matter.	Nunc rem non vidit.
I really believe that and you know that well	Ego vere credo quod et tu scis quod bene
This is what you need to hear	Hoc est, audire debes
It really isn't so hard.	Hoc vere non est ita difficile.
I choose to believe in him	Libet credere ei

I like what I see.	Quod ego amo video.
Thus he knew.	Ita sciebat.
I really wanted to talk	Ego vere voluit loqui
To understand.	Intelligere.
Not long.	Non diu.
I want you to find something for me	Volo te invenire aliquid in me
I hope you can do it too	Spero quod potes facere, etiam
I tried to think where the job was	Conatus sum cogitare ubi officium erat
I knew both of you	Sciebam enim utrumque
I just can't say	Ego iustus non possum dicere
But me too.	Sed me quoque.
I believe you don't do this	Credo te hoc non facere
There was no need.	Non opus fuit.
I think you know him	Puto te scire eum
It is true that no one knows for certain.	Verum est quod nemo pro certo scit.
Nothing is better than nothing.	Nihil melius est quam nihil.
This is not good.	Hoc non est bonum.
I will be at home.	Ego domi esse.
But let's be honest there is none.	Sed sit amet nulla est.
I see one thing that is	Video unum esse qui est
That's what.	Id quod.
There is a lot that can be done.	Multum est quod fieri potest.
All in all right.	Omnino recte.
I don't believe that	Non credo quod
I know that's not always easy.	Id non semper facile scio.
How like her father.	Quam similis ei pater.
I really like this advice.	Ego vere amo quod consilium.
I'm sure you're busy with something	Ego certe es occupatus ad aliquid
I can always stay long	Non possum semper manere diu
I could see this happening, too	Hoc fieri videre potui, etiam
And rightly indeed.	Et recte quidem.
Soon enough.	Mox satis est.
You are one.	Tu es unus.
You have years and years in this work.	Annos et annos in hoc opus habes.
I wanted to hear it	Audire eum volui
It is now.	Nunc est.
Almost all, but not all.	Fere omnes, sed non omnes.
To me for sure.	Ad me certe.
What's this?	Quid hic?
I don't see what	Non video quid vel
But this is it.	Sed hoc est.
I was absolutely ready to do	Omnino paratus eram facere
There was no time after.	Post tempus, non fuit.
It was just good to play	Sicut bonum erat ludere
To believe in us.	Credere in nos.
I just told you the thing	Ego iustus dixi tibi res
He left him behind.	Eo reliquit.
I had to go this way	Habui ut hoc modo
often not.	Saepe non est.
I would like to see more.	Plus videre vellem.
I'm not a man.	Non me homo.
Or it may be.	Vel ut sit.
Really like it.	Vere placet.
I have better advice	Non habeo melius consilium
You can't go home.	Nec potes ire domum.
I haven't heard anything yet.	Non audivi adhuc aliquid.
I just can't believe that	Ego iustus potest credere quod
Thus he did.	Sic fecit.
I had time to think	Tempus cogitare non habui
But he could not say nothing.	Sed nihil dicere non potuit.
I would like to be with me	Vellem mecum
But not for us.	Sed non nobis.
It was often enough.	Satis saepe erat.
I didn't know where to go	Ego nesciebam quo ire

I also wanted to think and understand	Volui etiam me cogitare et intelligere
And so that is for you.	Et sic quod pro vobis est.
I want to see me	Volo videre me
Again, this week it is.	Iterum, hoc septimana est.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
he can know.	scire potest.
I never thought about that until today	Numquam cogitavi ut usque hodie
I knew what I was up to.	Sciebam quid esset usque ad.
And so soon.	Et sic mox.
I'm sure to say it	Ego certe dicam illud
I forgot what you did to me	oblitus sum quid fecisti mihi
I just want everything to stay as it is	Ego iustus volo omnia manere sicut factum est
likely not working.	Verisimile non est opus.
I can still do my job	Non possum tamen facere officium meum
I'm not doing my job	Ego non facio officium me
Maybe she did what someone else told her.	Forsitan fecit quod aliquis ei indicavit.
You are happy this season.	Hoc tempore felix es.
I never thought something like this would happen	Numquam cogitavi aliquid simile hoc futurum
I still don't believe he told me	Ego tamen non credo dixit ad me
It's mine too.	Meum est etiam.
I love him too much to do it	Nimium amo illum facere quod ei
I won't do something like that again	Et non aliquid simile hoc iterum
Maybe this was me.	Hic mihi forte fuit.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
Something seems wrong.	Aliquid mali videtur.
I have a plan already	Habeo consilium iam
what have you?	quid habes?.
Maybe that's it.	Aliquam id est.
I wonder if she knows	Miror si illa scit
I could not live like this.	Non potui sic vivere.
can find 	invenire potest. 
He thinks.	Cogitat.
But it was enough	Sed ei quod satis erat
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
He has a plan for you too.	Consilium quoque tibi habet.
I didn't know he was there	Ego nesciebam eum ibi esse
But it is too much evil.	Sed nimium est malum.
There are pretty much to talk about.	Sunt satis multa loqui.
I haven't thought of it before	Non cogitavi ante
You'll never see him	Numquam videre eum
I do not doubt.	Non dubito.
I can't get enough of you.	Non possum satis de te.
I think we are going there	Puto nos ibi ire
yes but only that.	Etiam non nisi quam.
It was mine.	Meum erat.
I can do something for that now	Non possum aliquid, quod nunc
I want you to be sure	Volo te esse certus
I can give you one name	Nomen unum dare possum tibi
It is bad.	Malum est.
I like to see for me	Ego amo video vidi pro me
I only wanted help	Tantum voluit auxilium
I thought I was with you	Cogitavi ut esset apud te
A lot of time here.	Multum temporis hic.
Now was the time to play.	Nunc tempus erat ludere.
I don't doubt in that	Non dubito in eo
I am so lucky to have met that person	Ego tam felix esse ut homo occurrit
But that was the time.	Sed id tempus erat.
It is impossible to see.	Hoc fieri non potest videre.
I can't yet see.	Nondum videre possum scire.
I didn't know his name	Ego nesciebam nomen suum
I like to go with her.	Mihi placet ire ad eam.
It is time.	Tempus est.
Too much, too soon.	Nimium hoc, nimium cito.
We like it.	Nos placet.
There is so lucky there	Non est ita felix ibi
I haven't seen him much	Non vidi eum multum
I have nothing to believe	Non habeo quod tibi credere
I feel like my self again	Sentio sicut mea se iterum
This is not good.	Nec hoc bonum est.
Don't say it if you don't want it.	Noli dicere, si hoc non vis.
You don't like me single.	Et non sicut me unum.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
I want us to be together	Volo nos esse simul
There is no need for me indeed	Nihil opus est me vere
I can't help you with it	Non possum adiuvare vos ad eum
It will not be.	Non erit.
That's just him.	Id solum est ipsum.
I had your name	Ego quoque nomen tuum
I hope so.	Ita me spero.
Now at home.	Nunc domi.
No what you're not going to do.	Non quod non es facturus.
You are yourself.	Tu ipsum esse.
No not before.	Nulla non ante.
Who knows well.	Bene qui scit.
Please let me think you still do.	Placet me cogitare adhuc facere.
You already know who you are	Iam scio quis es
He could not say for sure.	Non potuit certe dicere.
I want to give you a name	Volo dare tibi nomen
I spend a lot of time	Me multum tempus agere
I don't know the question.	Ad quaestionem nescio.
I wanted that for him	Volui, quod pro eo
If there is any	Si quid est.
I could really hear it was me	Audire potui vere erat mihi
I know more about it than you do	Scio plus de eo quam tu facis
This makes it easy.	Hoc facit facile.
I could not speak	Non potui loqui
I need you to talk to me	Mihi opus est tibi loqui ad me
I was not the same person	Non eram idem homo
Take a look at this for yourself.	Vide tibi hoc.
I've heard one thing.	Audivi unum.
I forgot about it	Oblitus essem de eo
No need to post today	Non opus est ei post hodie
I couldn't do anything about it.	Non potui aliquid de illo.
I think it will work well for me	Puto bene mihi erit opus
Let it be also and .	Sit etiam et .
But he knew these things rightly.	Sed haec recte scivit.
I need to do it alone	Mihi opus est solum facere
Not only.	Non solum.
I never forgot	Numquam oblitus sum
They are very good.	Valde.
but it will not be.	sed non erit.
I'm happy if I can live with him	Sum felix, si potest vivere cum eo
You have everything from what you do.	Omnia habes ex eo quod facis.
He says with certainty.	Certo dicit.
What can we say about this?	Quid de hoc dicere possumus.
I don't think about you at all	Non cogitare de te omnino
I saw everything	Vidi omnia
And how that.	Et quam id.
He said he wanted to go home.	Dixit se velle domum ire.
Many things I could say	Multa potui dicere
and never will.	et numquam erit.
I heard what you said	Audivi quod dixisti
I know.	Scio.
For this is now certain that you see.	Hoc enim nunc certum est, quod vide.
I just want to do a good job	Ego iustus volo facere bonum officium
I'm glad that you did.	Gaudeo quod fecisti.
Not anything bad	Nec quicquam mali
he already knew for sure.	iam certe scivit.
Why? 	Quare?
he asked himself.	quaesivit ipse.
I don't have a house	Non habere domum
You don't want to be alone	Non vis esse solus
I've been on it before	Fui in eo ante
There was something more	Plus aliquid erat
And if he didn't do it, well.	Quod si non faceret, etiam bene.
It is probable.	Probabile est.
I just need to think through everything	Modo opus est cogitare per omnia
I can't see any of it	Ego non video aliquo ex eo
It is a great thing.	Magna res est.
Time and day.	Tempus et dies.
This is your journey	Hoc est iter tuum sum
Maybe it was always so good.	Forte tam bene semper fuit.
Not much, but something.	Non multum, sed aliquid.
I see the things that are not	Video quae non sunt
Maybe not for all, but for me.	Forsitan non omnibus, sed mihi.
He could do more.	Potuit plus facere.
I thought of him yet	Cogitavi eum adhuc
But that is not certain.	Id autem certum non est.
I need everybody to do their job	Mihi opus est omnibus facere suum officium
I am more than you	Ego plus quam tu
I don't know what to do with myself	Ego nescio quid faciam cum ipse
Here he comes home.	Hic domum venit.
I can't say exactly how to do this	Non possum dicere prorsus quomodo hoc facere
I wonder what you are thinking	Miror quid cogitas
perhaps not all.	fortasse non omnes.
I think that's all she does all day	Puto quod omnia quae facit totum diem
I believe in us.	Credo in nos.
I know what happened to the man	Ego scio quod factum est vir
You can't have both enough.	Utrumque habere satis non potes.
yes yes or no i can.	Etiam necne possum.
I knew this to be true	Sciebam hoc verum esse
But that's not here.	Sed id non hic.
Definitely appreciate some help.	Certo aliquo auxilio bene.
But so it was done.	Sed ita factum est.
I don't want to talk to anyone	Non vis loqui quis
I did everything for him.	Feci omnia ei.
He does not come.	Non venit.
already going so far	Iam eo usque
I don't think it is a dog.	Non puto canem esse.
But this was too much.	Sed hoc nimis erat.
I am sure about this	Certus sum de hoc
I tried and did the work	Conatus sum et fecit opus
What it looks like.	Quod spectat ut.
To do something.	Facere aliquid.
I don't know how, yet	nescio quomodo, nondum
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
There is not much to him	Non est quantum ad illum
I think that was the first time	Puto quod primum erat
You can buy the book here.	Librum hic emere potes.
Not better than here.	Non melius quam hic.
Maybe it was necessary.	Fortasse opus esset.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
I just don't see it happening.	Modo non video fieri.
I know what the problem is	Scio quid sit eius quaestio
He truly does.	Vere facit.
i think i need to get in there	Puto quod opus est ut in ibi
One good but only that	Unus bonus, sed solum quod
I travel alone	Ego solus iter
Maybe it wasn't before.	Aliquam non ante erat.
Good job too.	Bene quoque officium.
I don't think they do	Non puto se facere
I looked in the room	Vidi in cubiculum
The situation is so, and not exactly;	Ita se res habet, nec ita prorsus;
I know him better than you do	Scio eum melius quam tu facis
But that's almost the same thing.	Sed id ipsum fere.
I really wanted to talk to her.	Ego vere volui loqui ad eam.
Again here I see nothing.	Iterum hic nihil video.
I love him and he loves me	Ego eum amo et ille me amat
Tell me if you need anything.	Dic mihi, si quid opus est tibi.
It was really bad.	Vere erat malum.
I can't stay until morning	Non possum manere usque ad mane
It was time to think.	Tempus erat cogitare.
I like to hear it	Mihi placet audire eam
I want to find it	Ego vis invenire eam
I can't do it.	Non possum id facere.
I have scarcely seen.	vix vidi.
You never know here.	Tu numquam hic novi.
That we are all.	Quod nos omnes sumus.
Everything now, now, now.	Omnia nunc, nunc, nunc.
I want to be in here and now	Volo esse in hic et nunc
I knew you didn't come to me.	Sciebam non venire ad me.
i can still do it.	adhuc facere possum.
I can't see what has happened	Non possum videre quod factum est
I could not tell you why	Non potui tibi dicere quare
What is.	Quid est.
I also thought that I could not	Ego etiam putavi se non posse
Not really.	Non vere.
I never did like you	Numquam fecit sicut tu
I find out soon enough	Ego satis cito invenire
Not much.	Non multum.
But no one knows nothing.	Sed nemo nihil scit.
I need to hear her say	Mihi opus est audire eam dicere
It is not so, but it is.	Non sic est, sed est.
It is good for me to just talk to you.	Bonum est mihi sicut loqui tecum.
Not easy, but things.	Non facile, sed res.
I hope we can.	Ut spero possumus.
You never go to school.	Numquam tu scholam.
I could go and leave it	Non potui ire et relinquere eam
I call him.	Eum ego.
I certainly wasn't	Ego certe non erat
It was really good.	Vere bonum fuit.
He does the same.	Idem facit.
I can't do anything to him	Non possum facere quicquam ei
I didn't know you were in school	Ego nesciebam te fuisse in schola
That's none of the game.	Ut in ipsum nulla.
I could get out of the way	Ut de modo potui
It's a bad job.	Male opus est.
I don't need any time to think	Non opus est aliquo tempore cogitare
I don't know who to believe	Nescio quis credere
I didn't give you advice today	Non consilium dare tibi hodie
I can go with him	Non possum ire cum eo
I will tell her something from you	Dicam ei quod ab te
But yes, you have.	Sed sic, habes.
I just really wanted you there	Ego iustus vere voluit te ibi
It is never hard to say.	Numquam difficile est dicere.
It is not easy to say this.	Non est facile hoc dicere.
I need to feel myself again	Mihi opus est ut ipse iterum sentio
I know what you want to do	Scio quid vis facere
Never want to leave your room	Numquam vis relinquere cubiculum tuum
But I got it going.	Sed obtinuit ut id eat.
Great night	Magna nocte
I love how you are with me	Amo quomodo mecum es
I really like to do it	Ego vere amo ut faciam illud
I knew he wouldn't believe me	Sciebam se non credere mihi
I told you	Dixi vobis:
You believe in art.	Tu in es.
That was exactly my plan.	Prorsus id consilium meum fuit.
I spend a lot of time together	Et multum temporis in unum
His job was at home.	Officium suum domi erat.
I know what you mean	Scio quid velit
could not find.	Non potuit invenire.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Not even his name.	Ne eius quidem nomen.
I don't want to see me again	Nolo iterum me per
But not.	Sed non.
Paul.	Paulo.
That is none.	Id nulla est.
I don't feel right.	Non recte sentio.
This is evil.	Hoc est malum.
I don't like it.	Non placet id.
I can't have anything getting e	Non possum habere quod questus e
Now you can't.	Nunc non potest.
I do more than I do	Ego plus quam facit
I've never said it before.	nunquam ante dixi.
I knew there must be	Sciebam necesse est esse
Perhaps you did so.	Forsitan ita tu fecisti.
I am certain.	Certum habeo.
It was a great story.	Aliquam magna erat.
It's time to go.	Aliquam ut.
Certainly it will never happen to me	Certe numquam mihi futurum
It seems that his day made me	Videtur quod dies eius me fecit
This was about that time.	Hoc erat fere tempus illud.
I could not live with a dog	Canem vivere non potui in eo
I don't like him.	Non sicut eum.
I like you just where you are	Ego amo te sicut ubi es
I know, he thought.	Scio, putabat.
Do what you can.	Fac quod potes.
I want people to do well	Volo homines facere bene
But who's that.	Sed quis id.
I've seen it, but it doesn't concern me	Vidi eam, sed me non spectat
I didn't know that when I met	Ego nesciebam quod cum occurrit
I could not speak to him.	Non potui ei dicere.
He is a man.	Homo est.
Tonight I was	Hac nocte fui
he was ready.	paratus erat.
It was a video.	Erat video.
There is no way to get help with	Non est ita ut cum auxilio
It's not like a real job.	Hoc non est simile verum officium.
A little over a year ago.	Paulo plus anno.
It would seem that it is not.	Videtur quod non.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
I got it more than I understood	Et obtinuit eam plus quam intellexit
It was good.	Erat bonum.
I believe in what you say	Credo ei quod dicit
i think you mean	Puto te vult
I knew it was true	Sciebam verum esse
Well, rightly so.	Bene, recte.
I wish it were not	Utinam non esset
as to what it is.	ut quid id sit.
I would not.	Nolui.
That we are.	Quod nos.
I've always been my man	Ego semper fuit homo meus
But it seems good.	Sed bonum videtur.
I never wanted but I did	Numquam volui sed feci opus
I can still see this now	Non possum tamen videre hoc modo
I know you've done so much	Scio te fecisse tantum
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
It is necessary.	Necesse est.
And it can be done well.	Et bene potest.
good, good.	bonus, bonus.
I thought about it	Cogitavi de hoc
I still need it.	Mihi adhuc opus est.
I think he would do better.	melius facturum esse puto.
I saw a lot of things over there	Vidi multum ibi
Good indeed.	Bonum quidem.
Not much better.	Non multo melius.
I told you about it.	Dixi tibi de illo.
I'm doing really well.	Ego vere bene facere.
I wanted her to stay	Volui eam manere
Me with me	Me cum a me
Which cannot be so.	Quod ita esse non potest.
It is necessary to stop.	Necesse est prohibere.
Yes indeed, and it was.	Ita certe, et fuit.
Certainly I have not seen it.	Certe non ita me vidi.
It just started this week.	Hoc modo incepit hac septimana.
I could not live with him	Non potui vivere cum illo
I don't even mean it	Non quidem vult illud
i think what you said	Puto quod dixisti
I have a question before	Habeo quaestionem ante
I didn't know where my father is	Ego nesciebam ubi pater meus
But this is not	Sed hoc non est
This was true, but nothing else.	Hoc verum erat, sed nihil aliud.
He could only think better.	Melius solus potuit cogitare.
I need him	Mihi opus est ad eum
I wonder what we are going to do now	Miror quid nunc facturus sumus
I don't need to do it at all.	Non opus est omnino facere.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
I want to help hug	Volo auxilium amet
This is the force.	Haec vis est.
I thought about this whole project	Hoc totum consilium cogitavi
Nothing to do with him.	Nihil ad ipsum.
I wanted more than anything to be alone with her	Volui plus quam aliquid esse solum cum illa
I'll do something else.	Aliud faciam.
But you can't speak.	Sed loqui non potes.
I don't think he wants to talk to him	Non videtur velle loqui ei
This is not to be done	Non hoc fieri
I can't get through it	Non possum per illum
No one could say for sure.	Nemo certe dicere potuit.
I could not live like that	Non potui vivere sicut quod
Making a name for yourself.	Faciens nomen tibi.
I tried to speak but I could not	Conatus sum loqui, sed non potui
For I knew nothing to say.	Sciebam enim nihil dicere.
I know you want to go there now	Scio te ibi nunc vis ire
All right, indeed.	Recte quidem illa.
But he doesn't really.	Sed non vere habet.
So he made a name for it.	Ita nomen ei fecit.
I want you to stay too	Volo te quoque manere
I didn't want to go this far	Nolui hoc amplius ire
Never do it more than that.	Numquam id amplius quam.
I just want you to know that	Ego iustus volo te scire quod
Of this he did not know what he was doing.	De hoc nesciebat quid faceret.
I know he doesn't have money	Scio eum pecuniam non habere
I can't speak.	Non possum dicere.
My father is one who is well with me.	Pater meus unus est, qui bene mihi est.
He thinks that perhaps not enough is enough.	Putat fortasse non satis satis.
It was hard to find	Fuit difficile invenire
Or about three.	Vel fere tres.
therefore he knew how to find it also.	quare scivit eam quoque invenire.
It is enough.	Satis est.
You're not like us.	Non es similis nobis.
It is also important to some extent.	Etiam sit amet aliquam quam.
But where is he?	Sed ubi est?
I really don't say	Ego vere non dicere
Look there.	Vide ibi.
This cannot be good.	Hoc bonum esse non potest.
I thought what you said	Cogitavi quod dixit
You have to travel.	Tu ad iter.
But it really is.	Sed vere est.
In your plan	In consilium tuum
And indeed nothing.	Et quidem nihil.
Nothing I can do.	Nihil possum facere.
I have nothing.	Nihil habeo.
They could be out there.	Posse ex nulla.
I didn't know what was going to happen	Ego nesciebam quid esset futurum
I made money but not enough	Pecuniam feci, sed non satis
I know his name.	Nomen eius novi.
You don't want money.	Pecuniam non vis.
Not well.	Non bene.
The man has nothing	Vir nihil habet
I think that's what he did.	Id fecisse puto.
I just do this same thing	Ego iustus hoc idem est
He says we need more than that.	Dicit plus nobis opus esse.
I don't like being alone here.	Hic solus non placet.
I can't see how it was done.	Quomodo factum sit videre non possum.
I don't even know you've been through much	Ne quidem scio te multum in te fuisse
This cannot be.	Hoc esse non potest.
But it is for him.	Sed ad ipsum est.
I never know what	Numquam quid ad
I am after it.	Ego sum post eam.
He does a very good job too	A ipsum bonum officium facit etiam
I'll never do it again.	Numquam iterum faciam.
You will need something else.	Aliud tibi opus erit.
But that was and was not.	Sed id erat nec erat.
He wants you to live better.	Melius te vult vivere.
if you can do it.	si id facere potes.
Wishing is well, and now it's enough.	Bene est velle, et iam satis est.
I won't do it for you	Non faciam tibi
You have money.	Pecuniam habes.
Has something to say.	Habet aliquid dicere.
But that was how.	Sed id erat quam.
I don't think so.	Non puto id.
But again, it was not the same thing.	Sed iterum id ipsum non esset.
I don't want to know what's on this	Non vis scire quid ex hoc
Looks like a really bad thing.	Simile vere malum.
Tell me what you want to say.	Dic mihi quid vis dicere.
But who did not ask	Sed quis non quaesivit
And you are happy.	Et tu es felix.
I told him that there was not enough time	Dixi ei quod non erat satis temporis
He was soon forgotten.	Mox oblitus est.
I know what it looks like	Scio quid spectat sicut
Nor did he do it.	Nec fecit.
But as stated above.	Sed ut dictum est.
Is this something?	Estne hoc aliquid?
I don't know how I feel about him	Nescio quomodo sentio de illo
To do it well or better	Ut faciam ut bene vel melius
Or, here.	Vel, hic.
That's going to happen	Id futurum
He doesn't know what he wants.	Quid velit, nescit.
I can't think of me	Non possum cogitare de mea
And it was very late.	Et sero factum est valde.
He knows how we are.	Scit quomodo nos.
I'm glad to have him	Gaudeo me habere illum
He was looking good.	Ille bonus vultus erat.
I am not the same person anymore.	Ego non sum ipse homo amplius.
he eats me	comedit me.
I plan to go and see it.	Cogitavi ire et videre eam.
He looked very good.	Vidit ipsum bonum.
I've seen people do that.	Vidi homines facere.
I am so happy.	Non sum tam felix.
i think you're sick	Puto te male
He can't do this.	Hoc facere non potest.
Finally she could live as she wanted.	Tandem posset vivere ut vellet.
I had myself.	Ego ipse habui.
But I haven't seen him	Ego autem non vidi eum
He asked what he should do and told him.	Quaesivit quid faceret et indicavit ei.
Yes, but not for that.	Etiam non nisi enim.
I really want him well	Ego vere volo eum bene
I am not so	Non sum ita
I could do something	Potui aliquid
Nor are they.	Nec sunt.
He wanted to say that he was with him.	Voluit dicere eum esse cum eo.
not well with me.	Non bene mecum.
It's not done.	Non est factum.
I don't think it's going to be.	Non puto id futurum esse.
He did not do this.	Hoc non fecit.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
I could not at all	Omnino non potui
I know how to stop it	Scio quomodo prohibere eam
But he loves him.	Sed amet ipsum.
My dad must have too.	Meus pater quoque debet habere.
And this is good.	Et haec bona est.
This morning.	Hic mane.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
But it is too little, too late.	Sed id parum est, nimium sero.
Attempted.	Conatus est.
i'm so sorry for that	Paenitet me quod sum ita
It's time to get some out of it.	Aliquam non aliquam ex.
He is a good guy.	Is bonus guy.
I really don't think that was his problem	Ego vere non videtur quod esset eius quaestio
I would not believe.	Nolui credere.
i think i know it too	Puto etiam id scire

I know what you mean	Scio quid vis
I couldn't think why not	Non potui cogitare cur non

I really didn't know what to do	Ego vere nesciebam quid hoc facerem
I'm a boy.	Me puer.
I can't hear you	Non possum audire te

He loves to win for sure.	Vincere certe amat.
I want to be in this	Volo esse in hoc
We don't have a lot of time.	Non multum temporis sumus.
I want to go soon	Volo ire cito
Nothing for him.	Nihil pro eo.
I am a man like you.	Homo sum sicut tu.
This could go on and never stop.	Hoc posset ire et numquam prohibere.
I am very sorry	Paenitet me valde
He seemed to be thinking.	Videbatur cogitare.
I saw how well they play together	Vidi quomodo bene ludere simul
I hope to see you there!.	Spero te videre ibi !.
He's just bought.	Hic modo emit.
I don't know what happened at the time	nescio quid eo tempore factum est
It was a little too much today.	Nimis parum erat hodie ei.
That's a good thing	Ut sit bonum est
I can do this great for you	Hoc possum tibi magna
it seemed	videbatur .
I can't do anything about it	Non possum facere aliquid de illo
I can't think of this now	Non possum cogitare de hoc nunc
and I saw only one.	& vidi unum tantum.
He said he wanted to go with me.	Mecum vellet ire, dixit.
I could see something, only hear	Non potui videre aliquid, solum audire
Yes and he was out.	Etiam et erat ex.
I don't work this week	Et non opus hoc septimana
I was not yet ready to give	Nondum dare paratus eram
I don't have time to love him.	Ut non tempus ipsum.
I can't believe you don't do the same now.	Non possum tibi credere nunc ne idem facias.
It's not bad.	Non est malum.
For tomorrow that's the same thing.	Cras id ipsum enim.
I don't want to be interested in me	Nolo sit amet mihi
He wanted to do even more than his job.	Plus etiam facere voluit quam officium suum.
I want you to truly understand that	Volo te vere intelligere quod
I was not in this class at all	Hoc genus omnino non eram
It is not so.	Non est ita.
I want to see me	Volo te videre me
I could not see correctly.	Recte videre non potui.
We can do this work.	Hoc opus facere possumus.
That's all.	Totum id.
I wonder how you knew	Miror quomodo scivit
Look what I've done.	Vide quid mihi fecerit.
It looks great.	Magna videtur.
This is what he wanted to be like.	Hoc est quod simile esse voluit.
And now he is gone.	Et nunc abiit.
Really really.	Rem vere.
I would like to do the same.	Idem facere vellem.
I've never seen that before	Ego nunquam vidi quod ante
I am a good person.	Bonus homo sum.

I don't think it's possible.	Non puto posse.
Now is the time to plan.	Iam tempus consilium habet.
Very badly I wanted to get out of there	Valde male volui ut ex ibi
He was one.	Unus erat.
It is difficult to say either.	Difficile est vel dicere.
All from me.	Omnes a me.
I had to give him something	Ego quoque ad eum aliquid
I don't think that's what's wrong	Non puto quod quid mali est
I know it's hard to accept.	Scio hoc difficile accipere.
I also have something for you with here	Ego quoque habeo aliquid tibi cum huc
I knew what I needed	Sciebam quod mihi opus
He says nothing.	Nihil dicit.
Yes, you are.	Etiam, es.
I didn't know for sure	Ego nesciebam pro certo
And you can.	Et potes.
I knew this was going to happen	Sciebam etiam hoc futurum
I just want to do it	Ego iustus volo facere illud
It was good for him.	Bonum erat ei.
Thing is resolved	Res est certus
No one ever explained why he did it.	Nemo umquam cur id fecerit.
Just like me.	Sicut me.
There is no time for nothing.	Nulla tempus nulla est.
You want us along with you.	Vis nos una cum.
I can't tell anyone	Non possum dicere quis
But we can't help it.	Sed non possumus eam adiuvare.
All right again.	Omnia recte iterum.
I do it myself	Ego ipse facere
It was very important to us.	Erat nobis ipsum amet.
I still don't have room for me.	Ego adhuc non habeo cubiculum mihi.
I am more than	Ego plus quam
I need to get myself ready	Mihi opus est ut ipse paratus
It's time for some.	Aliquam sed aliquam enim.
I knew all the things that are not	Sciebam omnia quae non sunt
I'm afraid that too.	Vereor id quoque.
I want you to know this	Volo te scire hoc
I hope you'd like to do that	Spero quod velis facere
Well, that was hard for me.	Bene, quod mihi difficile erat.
I don't even know his real name	Non scio quidem nomen eius verum
I'm up to my job	Ego eum ad officium meum
If there would be any money there.	Si pecuniam ibi fore.
I was not here, he said	Hic non eram, dixit
It's too late.	Sero.
And it was not enough.	Et parum fuit.
it will be a success in the future.	id erit res in futurum.
At length he asked to go home.	Tandem domum ire rogavit.
Not the same yet.	Non idem tamen.
I want to see something else	Volo videre aliquid aliud
I can do this too	Hoc facere possum etiam
I wasn't sure what the matter was yet.	Certus eram quid res adhuc esset.
But I can say this.	Verum hoc possum dicere.
That you are not.	Quod non es.
Do both at the same time.	Fac utrumque simul.
I don't want anyone to know about it	Nolo quis scire de illo
I haven't seen her ever since.	Non vidi eam ex quo.
It's like you.	Est ut te.
I had a good time.	tempus bonum habui.
Certainly not time for anything else.	Certe non tempus aliud.
Yes it is a name.	Ita est nomen.
There's so much.	Nihil est tam.
You are with me now.	Nunc mecum es.
You are not there.	Non ibi.
I highly doubt	Valde dubito
And he knows what.	Et novit quid.
I did everything he told me	Ego feci omnia dixit ad me
I could find nothing here about him.	Nihil hic de eo invenire potui.
He is not here now.	Hic nunc non est.
There is nothing.	Nihil eft.
I can't talk now	Non possum dicere nunc
Now you know you understand.	Nunc scis te intelligere.
Only what he knows or does not yet know.	Tantum quod scit vel nondum scit.
I can do anything for you	Ut aliquid possit facere tibi
I think it would be ut	Puto fore ut
I don't know how to go	Nescio quomodo ire
I just want to get it out.	EGO iustus volo ut eam ex.
I thought she was there	Cogitavi eam et ibi erat
I would never want to be in someone	Nunquam volo quod in aliquo
I could not see if anything came to me.	Non potui videre si quid ad me venit.
to think, to think, to think.	Cogitare, cogitare, cogitare.
I couldn't believe him	Non potui credere ei
My race is on the road.	Genus est iter meum.
I didn't want to see her.	Nolui videre eam.
Yes that's a no.	Etiam id nulla enim.
I know everything there is to know about you	Scio omnia sit scire de te
No it's not always.	Nulla non semper enim.
It's pretty good.	Satis bonus est.
This was a good decision for him.	Hoc bonum consilium ei fuit.
you cannot be seen.	videri non potes.
I wanted to leave you alone	Hoc volui te solum relinquere
I didn't know what	Ego nesciebam quid
This he does.	Hoc facit.
I want to tell you everything	Volo tibi dicere omnia
Nothing for me.	Nihil mihi.
I just met yesterday	Ego iustus occurrit heri
You never know.	Numquam tu.
I thought you'd like to know	Cogitavi quod velis scire
I need to go that now	Ire debeo, quod nunc
It is not so here.	Non ita est hic.
Maybe he shouldn't.	Fortasse non debet.
I could not go with him	ire non potui cum eo
I just want to think about what happened	EGO iustus volo ut cogitare quod factum est
Nothing like	Nihil simile
I was not yet ready	Nondum paratus eram
So there you have it.	Sic ibi habes.
But you have to go.	Sed habes ire.
I can barely hear you	Vix possum te audire
I believe he is evil	Credo ipse est malum
But this is getting good.	Sed questus est hoc bonum.
It seemed too early yesterday morning.	Heri quoque mane mane videbatur.
I was not.	Non essem.
Even not.	Etiam non.
It is a great thing.	Res magna est.
I have what you say	Habeo quod dicit
I don't need to talk to him	Non opus est loqui ei
Which seems pretty easy.	Quod satis facile videtur.
But this is just about.	Sed haec mox de.
I don't want to be alone again	Non vis esse solum iterum
It's not easy to see my journey	Non facile est videre iter meum
It was not going to happen.	Futurum non erat.
I did better than either of you	Ego feci melius quam vel ex vobis
really didn't know what to do	vere nesciebat quid faceret
You have done it to me.	Ad me fecisti.
I just can't be with her	Modo non potest esse cum suo
It is mine, and not mine.	Meum est, et non meum.
he is a man.	homo est.
He was not a dog.	Canis non erat.
I believe in these things	Credo in haec
That he was not.	Ut non erat.
i think that's great	Puto quod magna
They are not working here.	Hic non sunt opus.
I never know anything about you till now	Numquam novi aliquid de te usque modo
This could be easily done.	Quod facile potuit.
Not so much.	Non ita multum.
The question comes again.	Quaestio iterum venit.
That he was not.	Ut non erat.
I don't want to think about school now	Non vis cogitare de schola nunc
I could only think how hard it was	Tantum cogitare potui quam difficile esset ei
But it was difficult to say with certainty.	Sed difficile erat pro certo dicere.
He is not going that way.	Non eat illuc.
He's finally here.	Hic tandem est.
So we can, you and me.	Sic possumus, me et te.
I need to get everything e	Mihi opus est ut omnia e
I could not get it	Non potui ut eam
I've never done anything wrong.	Nunquam quicquam mali feci.
I've done all of that	Ego feci omnia illa
He was not here yesterday or today.	Hic heri vel hodie non erat.
I know what the future will be	Scio quid futurum sit
He made everything from me.	Omnia a me fecit.
I know you can't	Scio te non possum
I didn't know all that well	Et ego nesciebam eum omnia, quae bene
I don't really know what to do with myself	Non vere scio quid faciam cum ipse
There is no need to think.	Nihil opus est cogitare.
I said, but not from me	Dixi, sed non ex me
All have a good time.	Omnes tempus bonum.
I couldn't believe that myself	Non potui credere quod ipse
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
I don't do anything.	Non aliquid.
I could not.	non potui.
But perhaps that's exactly what I need.	Sed fortasse id prorsus quid opus est.
But that does not occur to me.	Sed id mihi non occurrit.
I don't have anymore.	Non habeo, amplius.
This was true.	Hoc verum erat.
got lucky.	obtinuit felix.
I like the way they are each other	Ego similis modo sunt inter se
No one knows who it is.	Nemo scit quis sit.
Maybe it wasn't.	Fortasse non fuit.
But it was so.	Sed sic erat.
He was a very young boy.	Puer admodum erat.
But that is difficult.	Sed id difficile est.
We'll do it well to be there	Non faciam ut bene sit ibi
I didn't want to think.	Non volui cogitare.
He did not say any more.	Non dixit amplius.
already made a decision	Iam consilium feci
I hope to see you all over there!	Spero te videre omnia ibi!
He can do what he wants.	Consilium potest facere quod hic vult.
It is time.	Tempus est.
This will be the same.	Idem hoc erit.
I hope to see more of this in the future	Spero plus de hoc videre in futurum
You are the man.	Tu vir.
Why is it so important	Cur non tam magna
I have nothing but time	Ego nihil nisi tempus
This is no longer there.	Hoc iam non est.
You should get a dog at all.	Omnino canem accipere debes.
I'd like to say it is, but it is not.	Est dicere libet, sed non est.
Do what you want.	Facias ut vis.
I want to see him again	Volo videre eum iterum
It really shouldn't be.	Is vere non debet.
I have to do everything for me	Habeo facere omnia me
Yes it is enough.	Ita satis est.
I like to come to you.	Placet vobis venire.
He said that he knew and was going to do it.	Dixit se scire et esse facturum.
He likes to go.	Velit ut.
I heard much about you	Audivi quantum de te
Most likely he would be there.	Verisimile esset ibi.
But even so it is.	Sed vel ipsum est.
Certainly there was no question.	Certe nulla quaestio erat.
I was there I did it.	ibi fui id feci.
But that's often not the case.	Sed id saepe nisi.
It was too late.	Sero erat.
I knew what it was like	Sciebam quid simile
I don't think about it	Non videtur de eo
I can get him here tomorrow	Cras ipsum hic possum accipere
I don't doubt about it	Non dubito de illo
The problem is getting on time	Quaestio hoc tempore questus est
That's so good.	Id bonus.
We don't need it.	Non opus est nobis.
We know what you think.	Nos quid cogitas.
I can't say just looking at you	Non possum dicere, iustus vultus apud te
We can help you today.	Quod hodie te adiuvare possumus.
I don't want to find him	Nolo eum invenire
Maybe after dinner.	Forsitan ad cenam post.
I had not	Non habui
We wanted to see him play live.	Vivere voluit nos videre ludere.
to feel it.	ut sentio.
I don't want to go home	Non vis ire in domum suam
And unless he does it, he will never be happy.	Et nisi id fecerit, nunquam felix erit.
Make a bad time.	Fac tempus malum.
That's the point.	Id ad illud.
I know you are hard	Scio te esse difficile
I can't go no further	Non possum ire non amplius
It's really hard to say when you're done.	Vere difficile est dicere cum factum es.
I'm not sure what this is.	Quid hoc sit, non sum certus.
I just want to know more about you	EGO iustus volo scire de te
It was the same story.	Aliquam id ipsum erat.
I can't give it	Non possum dare ei
But let's love how important it is.	Sed sit amet quam sit amet est.
See you today.	Vide te hodie.
He could not speak yet.	Adhuc loqui non potuit.
To never believe in him	Ut numquam in illo
I wouldn't be here without her.	Hic sine illa non essem.
But we don't have time.	Sed non tempus habemus.
it will be bad.	male erit.
Or tell me something.	Vel dic aliquid.
It's not that hard.	Non quod difficile.
We're together tonight.	Simul hac nocte sumus.
I'm ready already	Paratus sum iam
I didn't know what to think or what to say	Ego nesciebam quid cogitare vel quid dicere
I think this is her plan for everything	Puto hoc eius consilium per omnia
I can't help me	Ego non possum me
I want to stay here with you	Volo manere hic apud te
I don't know what's wrong	Nescio quid mali est
I could not believe it.	Credere non potui.
What occurred here.	Quod hic occurrit.
See that often here lately.	Quod vide saepe huc nuper.
I didn't want to see her again	Nolui videre eam iterum
I don't even know you	Non quidem novi te
No one yet comes to him.	Nemo tamen venit ad eum.
He loves you.	Amat te.
I wonder if the same thing is still true	Miror si idem adhuc verum est
I want you there more than ever	Volo te ibi plus quam umquam
I can't believe it	Non possum credere eum esse
How to play.	Quomodo ludere.
I like to speak the truth of it	Ego ut verum loqui eam
I told myself that it was easy	Dixi me ut facile
He said he could not.	Dixit non posse.
I need to know something	Mihi opus est scire aliquid
Certainly not easy.	Certe non facile.
He is speaking.	Loquitur.
I know you don't want to see what happened	Scio te non vis videre quod factum est
i think this in	Puto hoc in
I could see him coming by.	per huc venire potui videre.
I need to talk to him	Mihi opus est dicere ei
but they are.	sed sunt.
Who, what, and why.	Qui quid et quare.
Someone could tell the truth.	Posset aliquis hoc verum dicere.
I never left it	Ut nunquam reliquit eam
A week ago it was so busy and now nothing	A septimana ante tam occupatus erat, et nunc, nihil
But this was really good for me	Sed hoc erat vere bonum mihi
He knew this to be true.	Sciebat hoc verum esse.
I just play with it	Ego iustus ludere eius
i'm very happy.	Sum valde felix.
I hope to see you again soon	Spero fore ut mox iterum
My dad was still at home in the morning.	Pater meus mane etiam domi erat.
You have everything.	Habes omnia.
I can't find that question	Non possum invenire quod quaestio
Never could, never was.	Numquam potuit, numquam fuit.
It was so.	Ita erat.
They are what we can do.	Sunt enim id quod possumus.
It was the same with my job.	Idem erat cum officium meum.
Everything is fine.	Omnia bene est.
And before that.	Et ante id ipsum.
I just can't believe it went	Ego iustus potest non credere quod abiit
I am not sure why.	Certus sum cur.
I heard about you	Audivi de te
I can't at least understand what you mean	Non possum certe intelligere quid vis
His work is for him.	Suo sibi opus esse.
They are .	Sunt .
That is still possible.	Quod adhuc fieri potest.
I was in almost everything	Fui in omnibus fere
Nothing else can be done yet.	Nihil tamen aliud fieri.
I was definitely getting home late	EGO eram certus nuper questus in domum suam
I'm not sure what to do	Non certus sum quid facere
I knew him well.	Sciebam eum bene.
I can't say you got it wrong	Non possum dicere te obtinuit id malum
I know exactly what to do	Scio prorsus quid faciendum sit
IT WAS MAID.	DICTUM FUIT.
it was not necessary.	necesse non fuit.
I wasn't sure of the time	Non eram certus temporis
It has everything or itself.	Habet eam omnia vel per se.
I just want to stay here	Ego iustus volo manere hic
I don't really know him very well	Non vere scio ipsum optime
I really can't do anything about it	Ego vere non potest aliquid de eius
This is too much.	Hoc nimium est.
I'm not doing you	Ego te non facere
He has an obligation.	Officium habet.
i think you like something too	Puto te aliquid simile etiam
It would be bad.	Malum esset.
and he understood.	et intellexit.
But on the basis of him.	Sed in ex ipsum.
I was looking into it now this morning	EGO eram vultus in eo modo hanc mane
That is currently out of email.	Quod sit amet ex quis.
It's something you don't want to do.	Est aliquid facere non vis.
not something for you or me	Non aliquid pro te vel me
She must be very happy at home.	Valde felix esse debet domi.
And to do that thing	Et ad eam rem facere
Great but not great.	Sed non magna magna.
That would be so.	Id ita esse.
I am not sure about anything else	Ego non sum certus de aliud
There is only one.	Unus est ibi.
But no no now.	Sed nec nulla nunc.
You should also.	Debes etiam.
I told you everything here and there	Dixi vobis omnia huc illuc
I wanted you my love	Volui tibi mea
I wanted to tell you something	Volui tibi aliquid dicere
Not much anymore.	Non multum amplius.
That's when.	Id cum.
I'm here thinking about you	Ego huc cogitas te
There is still some order from that.	Ex adhuc aliquam quo.
Nothing could hinder him.	Nihil prohibere potuit.
I believe nothing.	Nihil credo.
Male	Male.
Never let him down.	Numquam se.
This is true.	Hoc verum est.
Not to be seen unless you wish to be seen.	Non videri, nisi videri velis.
Never been there	Numquam ibi
I barely ever did	Ego vix umquam fecit
I'm not sure what his real name was	Non certus sum quod eius verum nomen erat
I could not think of it	Non potui cogitare de illo
I could never be on my own	Numquam potui in mea
I just don't believe this anymore.	Hoc solum non credo amplius.
I feel a lot better.	Multum melius sentio.
I was not tense.	Non fui temporis.
He was prepared.	Paratus erat.
I don't live this whole thing	Non hoc totum vivere
I wonder how you got it.	Miror quomodo obtinuit.
I've heard a lot about you.    	Audivi de te multum.    
This is true of him.	Verum de illo hic est.
Again yesterday.	Iterum heri.
This is enough.	Hoc satis est.
still I don't know what he means	adhuc quid sibi velit hoc nescio
I don't care about that.	Nolo rem.
I could do nothing with him	Nihil potui cum eo
I have tried.	Conatus sum.
You are sure.	Certus es.
I am always good to you	Ego bonus sum tibi semper
May it be a good time.	Sit tempus bonum.
That's how to do it yourself.	Ut id quam ipsum.
I just need to get through today	Modo opus est ut per hodie
I knew you'd find	Sciebam velis invenire
He still does not understand.	Ille adhuc non intellexit.
Not after the day that he had.	Non post diem quam habuit.
I need to stay tomorrow	Mihi opus est ut mane cras
I tried to help her but.	Conatus sum eam adiuvare, sed.
I think something is going to happen.	aliquid futurum puto.
We don't like it.	Non nobis placet.
I just want to know what it was	EGO iustus volo scire quid esset
I don't need to think long.	Non opus est diu cogitare.
I see nothing but that there is not anything there is not	Nihil video, sed quod non sit aliquid ibi non est
You do what you have.	Facis quod habes.
He wanted to come home.	Domum venire voluit.
I think you stay now	Puto te nunc manere
But that's never out.	Sed id numquam ex.
I know you can't get me	Scio me non potes accipere
.	.
That didn't occur to me.	Quod mihi non occurrit.
He also wanted to speak.	Loqui etiam voluit.
When it began.	Cum incepit.
Well he didn't want to give it up.	Bene noluit eam dare.
I wonder why we're here	Miror cur hic sumus
But not in this.	Sed non in hoc.
Well if so it was.	Bene, si ita esset.
I can do a whole lot more	Totum multum plus possum
Or not.	Vel non.
I know this is really hard for you	Scio hoc vere difficile est tibi
I could do something with	Non potui facere aliquid ex
No need, nothing.	Nihil opus, nihil.
that he would do it.	id se facturum.
I am not talking to you	Non sum loqui ad vos
I didn't know anything about it	Ego nesciebam quid de eo
Since .	Ex quo .
Don't wait.	Noli manere.
I wanted to get out of it too	Volui ut ex eo quoque
He says that he does not.	Dicit se non.
No one does it today.	Hodie nemo id facit.
I wanted to talk about it	Dicere volui de eius
I can give you what you want	Possum tibi dare quod vis
I don't know what this is	Nescio quid hoc est
That's true for me.	Verum id mihi.
I really like it	Ego vere amo is
I can't be this man	Non possum esse hic homo
He willed.	Voluit.
I just want you to think about it.	EGO iustus volo te cogitare de illo.
I know you have nothing to do	Scio te nihil ad hoc facere
Completely forgotten.	Omnino oblitus est.
I couldn't help what happened	Non potui auxilium quod factum est
He also does not.	Ipse quoque non.
I also forgot what happened	Me etiam oblitus es quod factum est
But this alone can be true to a certain extent.	Sed hoc solum potest esse verum usque ad aliquid.
I don't know what to say anymore.	Nescio quid amplius dicam.
I don't like this much.	Hoc non multum simile.
I didn't know of the time	Nesciebam temporis
I couldn't do anything about it	Non potui aliquid de illo
He didn't have time for sure.	Tempus non habuit, certe.
That would be enough for me.	Satis id mihi satis esset.
I see nothing else.	Nihil aliud video.
Hardly any little thing.	Vix id nulla paulo.
No one wants to see you there right now.	Nemo ibi te videre nunc vult.
I could not be here anymore	Hic non potui amplius
I still don't like it.	Et adhuc ne placet.
I can't believe this happens	Hoc fieri non possum credere
This is good for me now.	Hoc nunc mihi bonum est.
I don't know how to be.	Nescio quomodo esse.
You can't be certain.	Certum esse non potes.
It was bad.	Malum fuit.
He was with me yesterday.	Qui mecum heri erat.
I didn't know	Ego nesciebam
I think that you understand everything	Puto quod omnia intelligere
I actually mean that	Ego quidem vult quod
I gave him a great hug	Et dedit ei magna amet
At length at last.	Tandem tandem.
I forgot to tell you that before	Oblitus sum tibi dicere quod ante
Not working, however.	Non opus, sed.
I can see why you did it.	Videre possum cur id feceris.
Nothing can stop me now.	Nihil me nunc prohibere potest.
Do the job.	Fac officium.
Or it.	Vel id.
i love her a lot.	eam multum amo.
I want to be enough	Volo satis esse
He did not know what to do.	Nesciebat facere.
But here it is.	Hic tamen est.
I'm not sure about that.	Non sum certus de illo.
I love this too	Hoc etiam amo
I had to think about it	Ego habui cogitare de illo
And something will happen.	Et aliquid futurum est.
I was fine.	Bene eram.
I can't get it out now	Non possum eum nunc
I hope to see you again soon some day	Spero te videre iterum, mox aliquo die
I tried to think what it was like.	Conatus sum cogitare quid similis esset.
when it is important.	Cum sit amet.
I was not there to come	non eram in eo venire
I don't want help	Non vis auxilium
But I don't believe in him.	Sed non ipsum in.
I forgot that	Oblitus sum quod
Not that this is better.	Nec hoc quod melius est.
Don't talk anymore.	Noli amplius loqui.
What had happened.	Quod factum esset.
Not much is a lot	Non multum est multum
You don't.	Non facis.
I don't have a plan	Non habeo consilium
I just want to know something is happening.	Hoc tantum volo scire aliquid fieri.
I knew what I could do	Sciebam quid posset
I think it's okay.	Puto bene est.
I don't think it was bad	Non puto fuisse malum
I am the only person to hear it	Ego solus homo audire eam
Surely he could not.	Vere non potuit.
I may not sit	Ego fortasse non sit
But better.	Sed melius.
This does not mean.	Hoc non vult.
There are people here.	Sunt hic homines.
He was going to do something wrong.	Aliquid mali facturus erat.
if he	si ille.
Maybe not.	Fortasse non.
Maybe that's how it's been decided.	Fortasse id quomodo suus esse voluit.
I thought even more	Plus etiam cogitavi
I'm seen to see something.	Im 'videri aliquid videre.
I could easily swim there	Facile ibi natare potui
that is the thing.	id est rem.
That's not going to happen.	Quod non futurum est.
He was oblivious.	Esset oblitus.
how long has it been	quam diu fuit.
I was ready to get home	Paratus eram domum
Everyone does the same.	Omnibus idem facit.
But that's out now.	Sed id est ex nunc.
I didn't say how long.	non dixi quam diu.
Maybe it was.	Forte fuit.
Maybe he did it.	Fortasse fecit.
Do what you want us to do.	Fac nos quod vis facere.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
I hope to be able to do it	Spero posse facere
That can be any time	Quod potest esse aliquo tempore
I told her that	Et non indicavit ei quod
It was a little too much today	Erat ei hodie parum nimis
I like this guy now	Mihi placet hoc guy nunc
I looked like	Vidi simile
I have not been told to do this	Ad hoc sit dictum non sum
This plan was good.	Hoc consilium bonum fuit.
It is one thing.	Aliud est.
I believe this has been done	Hoc credo factum est
I'm sorting it all out	Ego genus illud omnibus
I have already done the work.	Iam opus feci.
it seems like a good thing.	sicut bonum videtur.
That's when it was really bad.	Id cum vere factum est malum.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
Now one of us.	Nunc quis ex nobis.
There is no force.	Nulla vis est.
You know how to get there.	Scis quam illuc.
And he says yes.	Et dicit quod sic.
It was not what he wanted.	Non erat quod voluit.
There is no id.	Non est id.
I think about you too	Puto te quoque
We have to see.	Habere nos videre.
We really had both	Nos vere habuit utrumque
I couldn't do my job	Non potui facere officium meum
I just didn't want to talk about that	Ego iustus noluit loqui quod
I know not to be	Scio non esse
Do it again.	Fac iterum.
I really didn't want to go	Ego vere noluit ire
Well done to all.	Bene omnibus.
I thought you went	Cogitavi te abiit
To see what you like.	Ad vide quid simile.
And well by it.	Et bene per eam.
I don't want to stop you	Non vult prohibere te
I know exactly what it looks like	Scio prorsus quid id simile
I have seen everything, but not here	Omnia vidi, sed non hic
I do not know whether there is anything between the two.	nescio an aliquid sit inter utrumque.
I was so ready	Ita paratus eram
But it is nothing else at all.	Sed non aliud est omnino.
I need to talk to you.	Mihi opus est ad te loqui.
I think that's something else	Puto quod aliquid aliud
I know how it is.	Scio quomodo sit.
But it was not before.	Sed non erat ante.
That was a good question.	Quod bonum quaestio fuit.
I think it's my first job	Puto me primum officium est
I think the thing is the thing.	Puto rem esse rem.
I can't talk about this anymore	Non possum loqui de hoc amplius
I don't believe you now	Non credo nunc
Something no one can really say.	Aliquid nemo vere dicere potest.
I wonder why we're here	Miror cur hic sumus
I can't make you think about this	Non possum facere vobis videtur de hoc
A really, really good job.	A vere, vere bonum officium.
I need some help.	Opus est aliquo auxilio.
Time for him now.	Ad eum iam tempus.
I didn't want to think	Nolui ut videtur
I don't want to talk to him	Non vis loqui ei
It probably was.	Probabile fuit.
He had us.	Habuit nos.
Don't do it for me.	Non faciam mihi.
I thought I would be	Putavi fore
Now I know that I will never do this work	Nunc scio quod nunquam hoc opus
And indeed so.	Et quidem ita.
I couldn't say anything to him	Non potui dicere ei aliquid
It is a bad decision.	Malum est consilium.
I don't want to talk.	Nolo loqui.
Today was going to be busy.	Hodie occupatus facturus esset.
This is not so.	Hoc non est ita.
He was all about	Ipse erat de omnibus
how to be.	quam esse.
But that's the same thing as it was.	Sed id ipsum ut erat.
Nothing seemed difficult.	Nihil difficile videbatur.
I think that is	Puto quod est
I can't help it	Non possum tibi non esse auxilium
i wanted it.	volui eam.
It is not easy to think.	Non est facile cogitare.
I could not say anything	Non potui dicere aliquid
I am up to me	Ego eum ad me
don't give her something	Non eam aliquid
not something else	Non aliquid aliud
That will take a little more time.	Quod paulo plus temporis erit.
He never knew who was not good.	Nunquam scivit bonum qui non erat.
there was only one.	una tantum fuit.
I just need the money.	Ego iustus opus pecuniam.
I see what a man is	Video quis homo sit
I didn't want to think about it now	Nolui cogitare de illo nunc
It's not my nationality, though.	Non est meum genus, sed.
But before him.	Sed id ipsum ante.
I am a man enough to say.	Sum homo satis dicere.
And he was really scared.	Et vere vix erat.
I want nothing	Nihil volo
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
Yes it is.	Etiam est.
he said yes.	dixit etiam.
I see your dog	Canem suum video te
I just want this cum	Ego iustus volo hoc in cum
I knew him for thirty years	Sciebam eum per triginta annos
I'm doing this for you	Facio pro in hoc
And we all have it.	Et nos omnes habemus id.
I do not know what	Nescio quid
I'm never late to class.	Ego numquam nuper ad genus.
I want to know about it	Volo scire de illo
It is not a book.	Non librum.
It was a name.	Nomen erat.
But this does not appear.	Sed hoc non videtur.
He was not kind.	Genus non erat.
But that's now.	Sed id nunc.
I saw you, boy, and you alone	te vidi, puer, et te solum
I'm just trying to help	Ego iustus conatur ad auxilium
I can completely understand that	Non possum omnino intelligere quod
Or not met.	Vel non occurrit.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I already told you it was hard to believe	Ego iam dixi vobis esset difficile credere
I will say one thing for him	Unum pro eo dicam
I wanted to love you	Volui te amo eam
I'm talking too badly.	Nimis male me loqui.
You're not here.	Non es hic.
He never said anything.	Nihil dixit numquam.
He ought to have.	Debet habere.
I told him to see you here	Dixi ei hic te videre
i think i know you already	Puto te scire iam
We can talk about it.	De illo loqui possumus.
That's going to happen again tonight, as well.	Quod iterum hac nocte futurum est, ut bene.
than never.	quam numquam.
I couldn't get it anymore	Non potui amplius accipere eam
It is certain.	Certum est.
I wanted to do it but never	Volui facere, sed numquam
Can any of us.	Aliquem ex nobis possit.
People don't think things.	Noli cogitare homines res.
No, not only from.	Nulla non nisi ex.
I knew something was wrong with me	Sciebam est aliquid mali me
Not you and yours, or me and mine.	Non tu et tua, vel me et meum.
He does what he wants.	Facit quod vult.
I want like nothing else	Volo enim sicut nihil aliud
You know better.	Melius, scis.
There is but one question.	Est autem una quaestio.
All I need to do is always have	Mihi opus est facere, semper habere
I want to work	Volo ad opus
He was just a boy.	Puer iustus erat.
I want to find her.	Volo enim eam invenire.
The father does not go.	Pater non eat.
You can do it well.	Potes id bene.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum est.
The fact that we all have to live	Factum quod omnes habemus vivere
What a great idea.	Magna quam.
Not much to do	Non multum facere
I am indebted to you this time	Debeo hoc tempore
He probably does.	Probabiliter facit.
Yes I said no.	Etiam non dictum nulla.
What's wrong	Quod mali fecerit
I can't think of anything	Non possum cogitare de aliquo
This work is never done yet	Hoc opus tamen numquam
I just love to know what's up to me	EGO iustus amo scire quid ad me
It has been long enough.	Satis diu fuit.
I don't have what you know.	Non habeo, quod scis.
I need some help here.	Hic opus est aliquo auxilio.
Never leave him	Numquam ab illo
Everyone is one.	Omnibus unum est.
I don't want to think about it	Non vis cogitare de illo
I would do it if not for him	facerem, si non sibi
Thus he gave.	Sic dedit.
Yes, that's some.	Etiam id aliquam est.
I want to talk to you more	Volo loqui ad te amplius
I want you to just talk to me	Volo ut iustus loqui ad me
I already told you	Ut iam dixi vobis
i had family.	genus habui.
All indeed.	Omnes quidem.
May be shipped out.	Sit sit amet ex.
But now he is gone.	Sed nunc abiit.
Help me some	Mihi aliquid auxilium
I need something more	Mihi opus est plus aliquid
I know one thing too.	Scio etiam unum.
year round, all is well.	Anno, per omnia bene.
There will also be.	Erit etiam.
And at this time it was done.	Et hoc tempore factum est.
It is the same here.	Simile est hic.
i'm not out of this	non sum ex hoc
He was always in order.	Ut in semper erat.
It is probably easy.	Probabile est facile.
I can't talk to anyone about this	Non possum ne loqui quis de hoc
He must say something.	Dicere aliquid ei necesse est.
I could understand him very well	Ipsum intelligere potui bene
But that's none of it.	Sed id ipsum nulla.
Everything is all right.	Omnia omnia recte.
I know what happened	Scio quod factum est
He said to him.	Dixit ei.
I like this if something happens	Placet hoc, si quid acciderit
There was no evidence.	Nihil fuit quod.
I will do the same.	Idem faciam.
Don't stay here.	Noli hic manere.
I feel very good about you	Sentio multum bona de te
But you are not.	Sed non es.
I can't help you now	Auxilium tibi non sum nunc
Too bad to say.	Nimis est dicere.
Or he does, but does not wish.	Vel facit, sed non velit.
You know what he does.	Scis et facit.
Always had something to say.	Semper habuit aliquid dicere.
I strongly believe in him	Valde credo in eo
He knows nothing more.	Nihil amplius novit.
I know you've got to do this	Scio te obtinuit hoc facere
Just told me to stop him	Sicut dictum est ad me prohibere eum
I can't do this anymore	Non possum hoc amplius
I guess it could be done.	Suspicor posse fieri.
I feel that way	Ego sentio illuc
How do you do this?	Quomodo hoc feceris.
I knew it was going to be good	Sciebam quod bonum erat futurum
We're here to talk about it now.	Hic modo loqui sumus.
And it is true.	Et verum est.
It was late now.	Nunc sero erat.
And I am today	Ego autem hodie
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
I want to give you.	Volo te dare.
But he does nothing.	Sed hoc nihil facit.
I am from this.	ex hoc sum.
I don't want to have someone	Non vis habere cum aliquo
I have money.	Pecuniam habeo.
I've never seen you	Ego numquam te
See here or here.	Vide hic vel hic.
Nothing to it.	Nihil ad eam.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
I could not say my name	Non potui dicere nomen meum
What a journey it was.	Quod iter erat.
But this could not help.	Sed hoc adiuvare non potuit.
I didn't say 'you know' as in this way	Non dixi, scis, ut hoc modo
For it will always be and always will be	Semper enim et semper erit
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
I knew that would be	Sciebam fore
I never heard of this	Numquam audivi de hoc
But it is not.	Sed non est.
Maybe you should do it.	Fortasse facias.
But it is important.	Aliquam sit amet nisi.
I just want people to talk about something else	Ego iustus volo homines loqui aliquid aliud
Always appreciate your help	Semper bene tuum auxilium
I can't go back again.	Iterum ire non possum.
I just don't think about it	Ego iustus non cogitare de eo
I wasn't really there	Non eram vere ibi
He was not there.	Ibi non erat.
I don't want to tell you too much at this time.	Nolo tibi nimium hoc tempore dicere.
There was one child in one	Unus erat puer in unum
And see this.	Et hoc vide.
Now that was it.	Nunc id erat erat.
I know it always owes its way	Scio eam semper debere esse suo modo
i was there that day	ibi eram, die illo
Yes, it is, it is.	Etiam, est, est.
But there is more.	Sed plus est.
I just wonder if enough is enough	Ego iustus miror si satis est satis
That's not always the case.	Ut non semper erat.
It's probably a job.	Probabiliter officium est.
It was good to find.	Bonum erat invenire.
Yes, that's a great idea.	Etiam id dictum magna.
Now he wants it to be said.	Nunc id dictum velit.
I thought it was	Putavi esse
He has it all.	Habet illud.
It's time and great.	Aliquam et magna est.
I want to make a good time today	Volo facere bonum tempus hodie
You can say anything you like, but you can't.	Dicere libet potes, sed non potes.
he left nothing.	nihil reliquit.
I hope to go there some day.	Spero aliquo die ibi ire.
Follow him when you have time.	Post eum, cum tempus habes.
in who's that great.	In quis quam magna.
I will say nothing more.	nihil dicam amplius.
I couldn't believe it was only for me	Non potui credere quod non solum ad me
I really just don't know	Ego vere iustus non est
Maybe it's the same thing.	Idem fortasse est.
Maybe he was here.	Forte hic erat.
Now? 	Nunc?
what do you mean.	Quid sit tibi.
It is not necessary to speak of this now.	De hoc nunc loqui non necesse est.
A little more.	A paulo plus.
Look, he thought.	Vide, putabat.
No that was for you.	Nulla id erat enim.
He was the only guy.	Solus guy erat.
I still post it	Ego tamen post eam
You are good with men.	Bonus es apud homines.
I just don't do this	Ego iustus non hoc
In order to be there.	In ut erat est.
Right? 	Recte?
I believe he would do it.	Facturum credo.
He said something about.	Dixit aliquid de.
Don't get me wrong.	Nec male.
I can't talk to him now	Non possum dicere ei nunc
They are all things.	Omnes res sunt.
It was true.	Verum erat.
they are not better than us.	non sunt melius quam nos.
I don't think so.	Non puto, sed.
But you need to act quickly.	Sed debes cito agere.
I could barely see anything	Vix aliquid videre potui
A little longer perhaps, but still a lot	Paulo diutius fortasse, sed tamen multum
I am really sorry for it	Ego vere paenitet ad eam
And see him.	Et vide ipsum.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
I have seen all these already	Vidi omnia haec iam
That was it.	Id erat.
I just want you to know	Ego iustus volo te scire
Now it wasn't him.	Nunc non ipsum erat.
i think she doesn't want to talk anymore	Puto se non velle loqui amplius
No, there was no need.	Non, nihil opus erat.
He truly loves me.	Vere me amat.
All in all it does.	Omnino facit.
Well, I hope you like me soon.	Bene, ut spero te mihi primum placet.
yes very happy	Etiam sit amet ipsum
with too much everything.	cum nimium omnia.
This thing is none.	Hoc res nulla est.
Now i'm in it.	Nunc in eo sum.
I never saw him leave.	numquam eum relinquere vidi.
I've heard everything.	Audivi omnia.
Well, let me say something.	Bene, aliquid dicam.
I have to come to it	Habeo venire ad illud
And it's okay by me.	Et bene est a me.
He was a dog.	Canis erat.
And you know it's about time too.	Et de tempore suus etiam scis.
Do not speak to him.	Noli ei dicere.
Only something never happened.	Tantum quod nunquam factum est.
Nothing but right.	Nihil tamen recte.
Thus he said.	Ita dixit.
I didn't know what to think or say	Ego nesciebam quid cogitare vel dicere
I don't know what's going to happen.	Nescio quid futurum est.
I'm not pro	Ego non pro
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
This is a lot.	Hoc multum est.
You can see how much you want here.	Hic videre potes quantum vis.
I wanted this to be true	Hoc verum esse volui
Again he said nothing.	Iterum nihil dixit.
Thus he does.	Sic agit.
But not for either.	Sed non enim vel.
I just can't help me	Ego iustus non possum me
I would like to have	Vellem habere
I think it may be too much	Puto fortasse nimium esse
you just want to make it home	Vos iustus volo ut eam domum
I said nothing at the time.	Nihil dixi tempore.
That's what we are.	Id quod sumus.
I just want to be	Ego iustus volo fieri
I know a little about this	Scio parum de hoc
This is his doing.	Hoc est suum facere.
As a person who can't help it	Sicut homo qui non potest auxilio
I have done everything for him.	Omnia feci ei.
I hope to see that you stop	Spero te videre quae te prohibere
I hope all is well with you.	Spero te bene omnia.
It was something to do.	Facere aliquid erat.
I barely even knew she needed to be there	Vix etiam scivi eam ibi opus esse
No matter what.	Nemo rem.
I want to do it	Volo me facere illud
I am not what you think	non sum quid cogitas
I want you to be there	Volo te ibi esse
I knew it was	Sciebam autem erat
I'd like to be wanted.	Libet esse volui.
Let me know when it was time	Me scire quod erat tempus
I don't know your name.	Non novi nomen tuum.
This is perhaps the first time I have ever imagined this.	Forsitan primum hoc umquam putabat.
i'm good.	Sum bonus.
I used to see from time to time	E tempore usque ad tempus videre eram
I wish he could come with us.	Utinam nobiscum venire posset.
I could hardly believe	Vix me credere potui
Good to hear.	Bonum est audire.
I do not have.	Non habeo.
But see what we have here.	Sed vide quid hic habemus.
and what I have done.	quod et feci.
To be honest.	Ut sit amet est.
It was not done.	Non factum est.
I have some question.	Habeo aliquam quaestionem.
I thought yes to this question	Cogitavi etiam hanc quaestionem
I think it's not going to happen	Puto non futurum
I see again.	iterum video.
You are the same.	Tu ipse es.
I think you really are something	Puto te vere esse aliquid
I'm not you anymore	Non sum tibi amplius
He always does well.	Bene semper facit.
I want time to think	Volo tempus cogitare
I like to be different	Ego similis esse aliud
I will tell him.	Dicam ei.
I don't know what to do next.	Nescio quid faciendum.
Maybe that's great.	Aliquam id magna.
But of all.	Sed ex omnibus.
I'm not here to win	Non sum hic vincere
You already know how to do the job	Iam scio quam facere officium
I can come here again tonight	Huc iterum nocte possum venire
I think this is good.	Hoc bonum puto.
I can see you as well	Non possum videre te sicut bene
You can tell why you did it.	Potes dicere cur id feceris.
Look through me.	Vide per me.
I really can't say enough about everything and everything	Ego vere non possum dicere satis de omnibus et de omnibus
But that is not with us.	Sed id non est apud nos.
He didn't want anyone talking.	Noluit quis loquitur.
What seems to have happened.	Quod videtur factum.
ET ET ET.	EST ET ET.
You have to do it.	Facere tibi eum.
And i actually like it.	Et mihi quidem placet.
I don't know what happened now.	Nescio quid nunc factum est.
He was very kind.	Ipsum genus eum.
And it is to find him.	Et ipsum sit invenire ipsum.
I have all of it	Habeo omnia eius
They're definitely there.	Sunt certus ibi.
I'm only ever.	Me nisi semper.
There is no one at any front.	Nulla quis aliquam ante.
He was not in it.	Non erat in.
I don't have a thing to say	Non habeo rem dicere
I know it has been a long time	Scio diu fuit
I know we do	Scio nos facere
It is not that.	Non est illud.
I know what it was	Scio quid esset
I am really happy to be at home	Ego vere felix esse domi
Now was not the time.	Nunc nec tempus erat.
It should not be said.	Dictum non debet.
I need it and I need it	Mihi opus est ei et mihi opus
Never be the same again.	Idem numquam iterum.
But this is not true.	Hoc autem non est verum.
I think that's what it is.	Puto id quod est.
He was at home.	Domi erat.
I need to believe you can do it	Mihi opus est credere potes facere
What was said.	Dictum quid.
No one says.	Dicit nemo.
She thought nothing was like that.	Putavit nihil esse simile.
I thought, perhaps more than thirty	Cogitavi, fortasse plus quam triginta
I can't get it before the day	Non possum accipere ante diem
Not so much today.	Non tam hodie.
I know what is possible with you	Scio quod fieri potest apud te
I know that there is one	Scio quod sit unum
Never asked anyone	Nunquam quaesivit quis
I wanted to say something but I didn't know what	Aliquid dicere volui sed nesciebam quid
I heard something like	Audivi aliquid simile
I don't know if you did.	Nescio si feceris.
You can see me there later.	Potes ibi post me videre.
She did not want to be, nor was she ever again.	Illa esse noluit, nec umquam iterum fuit.
I don't do what anyone wants me to do	Non facere quod quis vult me ​​facere
Maybe I'm not	Quod forte non sum
Maybe that's it.	Aliquam id est est.
I thought of myself at last	Cogitavi mihi tandem
This is how much time you have.	Hoc est quantum tempus habes.
i think i can be	Puto quod non potest esse
I told him that not much	Dixi ei qui non multum
Now it was not before.	Nunc non erat ante.
I don't think too much about it	Non videtur nimium de illo
I could not say this	Non potui dicere hoc
There is more to it.	Plus est ad eam.
Look at what's happened.	Vide quid acciderit.
It was not good.	Non erat bonum.
This was	Hoc erat.
He can't speak.	Se dicere non potest.
for sure he had.	pro certo habuit.
I didn't know you were coming until this morning	Ego nesciebam te venire usque ad hanc mane
I couldn't tell my true	Non potui dicere verum meum,
I saw something	Vidi aliquid
He did not know why.	Cur, nesciebat.
I don't mean something happened to him	Non vult aliquid factum est ei
I'm all about you	Ego te de omnibus
And yet he came so quickly.	Et tamen tam cito venit.
All I could see	Omnes potui videre, vere
I don't mean to be like that.	Non vult esse simile.
I am ready for this.	Ad hoc paratus sum.
I told myself the first time in the morning	Dixi me ipsum primum mane
I don't feel anything.	Non sentio quicquam.
I haven't seen this year.	Hoc anno non vidi.
But we do not have.	Sed non habemus.
One said for him, one for me.	Unus pro illo, unus pro me, dixit.
Maybe you!	Forsitan tu!.
never get out of me	Numquam ex me
It is easy to see what	Facile est videre quid
I know what it is	Scio quid sit
I could not see why this was true.	cur hoc verum sit videre non potui.
Yes that is good.	Ita quod bonum est.
It is probable.	Probabile est.
That's it.	Ut id est.
I don't really know what to post today	Non vere scio quid post hodie
I always	Ego semper
likely not to be too large.	Verisimile non erit nimis magna.
I think it will be here before	Puto quod hic erit ante
I didn't know better	Ego nesciebam melius
Maybe it was too much.	Aliquam erat nimium.
But with me in that.	Sed mecum in illud.
That is, he can't do it.	Quod est, facere non potest.
I saw it again and went	Vidi iterum abiit
I need to do something	Mihi opus est facere aliquid
I can't believe it's happening yet.	Fieri tamen non possum satis credere.
I've seen people do it for me.	Vidi homines id mihi.
I can't help you, you can't help me	Non possum te adiuvare, nec me adiuvare potes
i thought one thing	Putabam unum
I can't go through this again	Non possum ire per hoc iterum
We have a lot to talk about.	Multa loqui habemus.
I tried to get a little something for everyone.	Conatus sum parum aliquid pro omnibus accipere.
This was necessary.	Hoc opus erat.
It's not always the same thing you do.	Non semper idem, rem sic facis.
I can't go through this	Non possum hoc ire per
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.

That's a lot to say.	Quod multum est dicere.
I didn't think it would be like this	Non putavi fore ut hoc

I just don't feel anymore	Modo non sentio amplius
I'll tell her to get home.	Dicam ei ut domum.
In and out.	In et ex.
No one comes to mind.	Nemo occurrit.
That is hard to find.	Quod difficile est invenire.
I know what you do for me	Scio te facere ad me

Yes, but it was not.	Etiam nec erat nisi.

I was all and all.	fui omnia et omnes.

None of him asked what had happened.	Nemo ex eo quaesivit quid factum esset.
I need something for me to go.	Mihi opus est quod ad me ire.

I know your family.	Novi tua.
We can not.	Non possumus.
I have seen so much done	Vidi tantum fieri

But neither was it said at all.	Sed nec dictum nulla.
He knows me so well.	Ita me bene novit.
My father knows that. 	Pater meus scit quod. 
not sure what that is.	non certe quid id est.
Maybe there was still one.	Forte adhuc unus fuit.
I can still help you	Non possum etiam adiuvare vos
I'm not sure if this is still possible	Non certus sum si hoc etiam fieri potest
I need to get where it came from	Mihi opus est ut ubi ab eo
No one told me why?	Nemo mihi cur?
You never know when it will happen.	Tu numquam scis quando futurum est.
It was great.	Magna erat.
what shall I say?	quid dicam.
You don't want to be	Non vis esse
This year .	Hoc anno .
I saw myself	Vidi ipse
This is who we are.	Hic est qui sumus.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
But this does not mean that we have nothing to do.	Sed hoc non est, nihil ad nos facere.
I could have done better	Potui melius
He should.	DEBET.
I don't want to believe that	Nolo credere quod
I find exactly what it is	Ego invenire prorsus quod factum est
I didn't know why it was so hard	Ego nesciebam cur tam difficile esset
But that is not the case.	Sed id ipsum non est.
See me no more.	Vide ne me amplius.
The things I wanted in me	Quae volui in me
This morning I heard from him.	Hoc mane ab eo audivi.
knows how to play	Scit ludere
It was what it was.	Erat quod erat.
Not right yet.	Non recte tamen.
i wouldn't ever again.	nolui semper iterum.
Stay with us.	Mane nobiscum.
It seemed like a lot.	Is multum similis videbatur.
he did not know who was there.	nesciebat quis ibi esset.
I can't leave without them.	Sine illa relinquere non possum.
He does this always.	Hoc facit semper.
You don't want to leave	Non vis relinquere
not better.	Non melius.
This guy will help you.	Hoc guy erit tibi.
I didn't know what it was	Nesciebam quid esset
As it has been said.	Ut id dictum est.
That means nothing.	Id nihil.
It will be time.	Tempus erit sic erit.
I've been busy busy	Fui occupatus occupatus
I just can't do that to me	Ego iustus non potest facere quod ad me
I knew you understand	Sciebam te intelligere
This is similar.	Hoc simile est.
I could swim	Potui et natare
Tried to use it	Conatus ad eam
But who is great?	Sed quis magna est.
This is certain.	Certum hoc est.
I was ready.	Paratus essem.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
And thus, this is still true.	Et sic, hoc adhuc verum est.
I didn't know what day it was	Ego nesciebam quo die esset
My husband refused to leave him.	Vir meus eum relinquere noluit.
I am not sure.	Non sum certus.
I just want to talk to you some more	Ego iustus volo loqui tibi aliquid amplius
I could not hear what	Non potui audire quid
I would like to help	Vellem me adiuvet
It doesn't look bad.	Malum non videri.
I can be like that too	Ego potest esse sicut id quoque
Even when not well.	Etiam cum non bene.
Just something between us	Sicut aliquid inter nos
We just spend a lot of time together.	Non solum multum temporis simul.
I didn't know if it was working	Ego nesciebam si esset opus
We can do better than	Possumus facere melius quam
Got your first job.	Obtinuit primum officium.
It seems to have exactly what you want.	Quod vis prorsus habere videtur.
I don't know that indeed.	Nescio quod quidem.
That's it.	Ut id est.
I'm not doing you	Ego non te facere
But he did not expect this to be done.	Sed hoc fieri non putabat.
He knew that he was.	Sciebat esse se.
I wanted him to stay.	eum manere volui.
I want it all to go	Volo eam omnes ire
This I know you can't understand	Hoc scio non potes intelligere
That's what he really wants.	Id quod vere vult.
perhaps a little before.	fortasse paulo ante.
If you know that you are not, you are.	Si scis te non esse, te esse.
It's who we are.	Est qui sumus.
yes it is fun now.	Etiam sit amet nunc.
Just need to do something better.	Sicut opus facere aliquid melius.
I knew she was ready	Sciebam non erat paratus
I am the man at home who loves me	Ego vir domi qui amat me
He is gone now, he is gone forever.	Abiit nunc, abiit semper.
And it was not enough.	Et parum fuit.
He doesn't have much to say.	Non habet multa dicere.
No one spoke to him.	Nemo ei dixit.
But none at all either.	Sed vel ipsum nulla.
I don't even know why.	Nescio quidem cur.
But he can't stop.	Sed prohibere non potest.
He willed.	Voluit.
You are so lucky.	Tam felix.
I need to think	Mihi opus est ad cogitare
Look at this one.	Hoc unum vide.
You are a very lucky boy.	Nimis felix puer es.
If he would, he thought.	Si velit, putavit.
It was indeed enough.	Satis quidem fuit.
I have not seen you.	Non vidi te.
I really appreciate you indeed	Ego vere bene quidem
Say yes to him.	Dic etiam ei.
I don't like it too much	Et non sicut quod nimis
This is something that is going to happen.	Hoc est aliquid, quod futurum est.
I'm not sure why not.	Non sum certus cur non.
Which is generally said.	Quod fere dictum est.
He came in the night.	Nocte venit.
We must do it.	Faciendum est nobis.
All you can do now is buy time.	Omnia nunc facere potest tempus emere.
I'm often late to work	Ego saepe nuper ad opus
I feel like it is	Sentio sicut est
I think you have this thing	Puto hanc rem habere
It is true.	Verum est.
and nothing was done.	et nihil factum est.
I didn't but I'm not sure yet.	Feci sed non certum adhuc.
I don't believe in you anymore	Non credo in te amplius
You will always be with me	Semper te mecum
You should have someone.	Debes habere aliquem.
That's what you want.	Quod quid vis.
That's the only thing you can believe right now.	Id solum est nunc credere potes.
Good boy.	Bonus puer.
This is just my advice.	Hoc est solum consilium meum.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
You can see when she is.	Videre potes, cum illa est.
I don't like it anymore than you.	Non placet amplius quam tu.
No more.	Non amplius.
i know you got one	Scio te obtinuit unum
But he himself understood.	Sed ipse intellexit.
I couldn't say anything else	Non potui dicere aliquid aliud
Now there's a lot of great things.	Nunc sit amet magna nulla.
Again she refused.	Iterum illa noluit.
I didn't know who it was	Et ego nesciebam quis esset
There was a plan.	Consilium fuit.
She told me not.	Non indicavit mihi.
i think so-so	Puto sic, sic
If there is anything else, say it now.	Si quid est aliud, dic modo.
I don't see what happened	Quod factum non video
Is that.	Estne quam.
But there was no wish.	Sed non erat velit.
I want to see him	Volo videre eum
There was little to do.	Erat parum ei faciendum.
I told him it was okay	Dixi ei bene esse
I am not anymore	Non sum ego amplius
Thus to .	Sic ad .
I just can't help myself.	Modo non possum me.
Nothing for him.	Nihil pro eo.
I believe you are one	Credo te unum
I am pretty this morning	Ego satis hoc mane
He soon got home.	Qui mox domum obtinuit.
I already knew what she thought	Iam sciebam quid putavit
I don't care right now.	Nolo nunc.
I want you to stay with me as well	Volo autem vos manere mecum ut bene
he said to himself	dixit ad se
I've heard so much.	Audivi tantum.
If he can, he is a man.	Si potest, homo est.
I don't believe	Non credo
I will not say, but it is	Non dicam, sed est
I feel the same about you	Idem sentio de te
I feel you do a great thing with him	Sentio te facere magna res cum eo
The guy should feel pretty good about him.	Quod de se satis bonum facere debet guy sentio.
No, but only	Non, sed solum
It is the same.	Simile est illud.
I could hear, but I could not see, even now scarcely.	Audire potui, sed videre non potui, vel vix modo.
There was nothing like you.	Nihil erat te similis.
I never met a guy like you before	Numquam occurrit a guy ut ante te
It was not my business.	Non erat res mea.
I know just what's happened.	Scio modo quid acciderit.
I wasn't really sure what it was	Ego vere certus non essem quid esset
i can never find it.	numquam eam invenire possum.
I could not understand what it was	Non potui intelligere quid esset
I don't want to live like this	Nolo sic vivere
I love you.	Te amo.
I can't do what you say	Non possum facere quod dicit
Maybe he said the truth.	Fortasse verum dixit.
But he did not know.	Sed nesciebat.
Haven't been to him yet this morning	Non fuit ad eum adhuc hoc mane
Yes that is great.	Etiam id magna est.
I still can't think of anything	Ego tamen non potest aliquid cogitare de
And finally he did it	Et tandem fecit eum
See also yours.	Vide etiam tua.
I really don't need much time.	Et vere non multum opus est.
I couldn't win on anything	Non potui vincere in aliquid
I can help	Ut possit auxilium
Now I don't know how to do it.	Nunc non quam id.
I have a chance	Ego habere forte
I did not meet.	Mihi non occurrit.
But if you really want.	Si vis tamen vere.
That's the same thing as it is.	Id ipsum ut est.
I can't say that he wants me to stay	Non possum dicere se velle me manere
This morning seems to me to have been something.	Hoc mane mihi videtur aliquid fuisse.
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
I'm not a boy anymore.	Non sum puer amplius.
I've never met a guy before	Ego nunquam occurrit in guy ante
Now I see that	Nunc video esse
I don't want you to know.	Nolo te scio.
Again I was all alone	Iterum solus eram omnia
What I do.	Quod facio.
I hope you are great	Spero magna
I didn't know what it was	Ego nesciebam quid esset
Or a little.	Vel parum.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
I don't like him very much.	Eum non valde amo.
How well it is so	Ut bene sit tam
He knew, but not both.	Scivit, sed non utrumque loqui.
But with him I could not help	Sed cum eo non potui auxilium
I did it for myself.	Feci pro me.
I will definitely buy more.	Certus sum plus emere.
He just didn't understand.	Iustus non intellexit.
i can't see you again.	iterum te videre non possum.
Always be there for you	Semper ibi pro vobis
I just want to help her	Ego iustus volo ad auxilium eius
think that it is necessary.	opus esse putat.
I knew that I would never be	Sciebam quod nunquam esse
I never really used to do anything.	Numquam vere ad aliquid.
I think it would keep going.	Puto fore ut eat.
I am not sure how .	Non sum certus quomodo .
I like it for you.	Placet enim est.
I've never seen it before.	Numquam ante ut.
i knew this one	Hoc scivi unum
Please be on time.	Sis in tempore.
You can do this alone.	Solus hoc consilium facere potes.
I can't stop myself.	Non possum me prohibere.
There is still work to be done.	Est opus adhuc faciendum.
There is something	Non est aliquid
I have to go to it	Habeo ut ad eam
If you don't want to do it, you don't have it.	Quod si facere non vis, non habes.
I know what's yours	Scio quid sit tuum
It's already enough.	Jam satis est.
I can't do it for all of us	Non possum facere eum pro omnibus nobis
As it was ex	Ut non erat ex
I like to believe, but now	Mihi placet credere, sed nunc
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
But not by whom.	Sed non quo.
I'm going to get you	Ego te ad rem
i like to do mine too	Mihi placet facere mea etiam
I doubt you will ever	Dubito semper vult
I didn't know what to do with it	Ego nesciebam quid faciam illud
Even before today.	Etiam hodie ante.
I could not see	Non potui videre posse
No, never, now.	Non, numquam, nunc.
I wonder what you mean	Miror quid velit
You still do.	Adhuc facis.
I can't do this without him	Non possum hoc facere sine eo
I don't need it.	Mihi non opus est.
I wasn't sure you'll stop	Non eram certus te prohibere
And this is what you want to understand.	Et hoc ipsum est quod vis intelligere.
It was too late.	Sero factum est.
No no no how great.	Nulla nec magna quam.
I said to him that he is a pretty wife	Et dixit ei quod satis uxorem
But this is your plan.	Sed tuum est consilium.
I just didn't know what he meant	Modo nesciebat quid vellet
He did not say.	Non dixit.
I think it will be for next year	Puto pro eo anno proximo erit
I don't see you having one in you.	Non video te unum habere in te.
I wanted to tell you	Volui tibi dicere
often come here by me	Saepe huc per me
I know and you do	Scio et tu facis
They are all men.	Omnes homines sunt.
I don't see	Ego non video
I know she wants to see you again	Scio se velle te videre iterum
You know, I need it.	Scis, ut, opus.
I can't say that	Non possum dicere quod
He spoke thus.	Sic dixit.
I know how she doesn't like her in that	Scio quomodo illa non placet ei in illa
If not.	Si non.
I didn't know how to be	Nesciebam quomodo esse
You'll never look good yesterday.	Numquam tibi heri bonum vide.
Yes, good advice.	Etiam, consilium bonum.
You have lunch.	Prandium habes.
Don't let anyone either.	Ne quis vel.
Not this.	Non hoc.
This is what he always says now.	Hoc est quod nunc semper dicit.
That is true.	Id verum est.
I thought you would be in it	Ego te in eo fore putavi
He does the same.	Idem facit.
I heard him all too well	Omnes nimium bene audivi eum
He was almost ready.	Erat fere paratus.
I couldn't do it on time	Non potui facere ex tempore
I could help him	Eum ego potui
No as stated.	Nulla ut dictum est.
He said that he did not even know this.	Ne hoc quidem dixit se scire.
This was again.	Hic iterum fuit.
See you soon.	Vide te mox.
This one is truly both.	Hoc unum est vere utrumque.
I didn't know it is possible	Ego nesciebam fieri potest
Too bad it is.	Nimis malum est.
To be there.	Esse est.
Which he did not.	Quod non fecit.
It is what we do.	Facere quam nobis est.
I don't think so good morning	Non puto hoc bonum mane
What a great way to stay.	Quam magna manere.
I need to hear what you say	Mihi opus est audire te dicere
Let me know what happened	Me scire quid factum est
I just went and did it.	Ego iustus abiit et fecit.
Certainly I have seen nothing like this	Certe nihil simile hoc vidi
I can't help you	Non possum eam tibi
And indeed it was not true.	Et vere non erat verum.
I guess they know.	Suspicor se scire.
I am much better than	Ego sum multo melius quam
He never said anything about him.	Nihil umquam de eo dixit.
I was ready to talk to him	Paratus eram loqui ei
But nothing is to be done.	Sed fieri nihil est.
Never think too much.	Numquam nimis valde videtur.
I have tried.	Conatus sum.
Not even here.	Ne hic quidem est.
There was no better.	Ibi melius fuit.
Do that and often save.	Fac ut et saepe nisi.
Now that's gone.	Iam quod abiit.
Very well what have you done	Valde bene quid fecisti
Let me do what he's gone	Me fac quod ille abiit
I think it's just your race	Puto quod suus 'iustus genus tuum
He seems to have done this.	Id fecisse videtur.
I could not speak any more.	Non potui amplius dicere.
I make out of it"	Ego fac ex eo "
I feel that the child is not good enough	Sentio quod puer non satis videtur
I think this is the job	Puto hic officium est
Not even you.	Ne tu quidem.
I love her in every way	Ego amo eam in omnibus omnibus
But not her.	Sed non eam.
I can't play.	Ludere non possum.
I saw the whole thing	Vidi totum
I don't want to talk.	Nolo loqui.
You need to think about everything	Opus est tibi omnia cogitare
Not so much here.	Hic, non tam.
your very own.	ipsum tuum.
But this will not be.	Sed hoc non erit.
I doubt anyone will be there	Dubito quis ibi erit
I'll get to it.	Et ut ad eam.
I love everything like that	Amo omnia sicut quod
We want it again	Nos iterum volo
We'll never do it soon.	Nobis numquam id cum.
i think i need you	Puto opus est tibi
I want to help you.	Volo te adiuvare.
But probably not.	Sed verisimile non est.
You don't have.	Non habes.
He is the one who knows what he wants.	Is est qui scit quid velit.
After him	Post eum.
And he wanted to be there.	Et ibi esse voluit.
I could do nothing without assistance.	sine auxilio nihil potui facere.
But today was a good day.	Sed hodie erat vir bonus dies.
I can't see who to do	Non possum videre qui hoc facere
I was not happy to	Non eram felix ut
I wonder what's wrong with her	Miror quid mali eius
I will do it tonight.	Ego hac nocte faciam.
I can't talk more tonight	Non possum dicere amplius hac nocte
Maybe you got something.	Aliquam aliquid obtinuit.
I can barely believe it	Vix possum credere vel
It was not that, not more.	Non erat id, non amplius.
Always do it too	Semper id quoque
But at least he can speak.	Sed certe loqui potest.
It will be better.	Melius erit.
I want to see it all	Volo vide illud
It is done.	Factum est.
He could not say why.	Non potuit dicere quare.
I really thought it was	Ego vere putavi rem
I know how these things are	Scio quomodo haec sunt
And he is not here.	Et non est hic.
I want to be good with him	Volo esse bene cum eo
But it is up to you to find out.	Sed ad te est invenire.
This was going to happen.	Hoc futurum erat.
I am the only one who I do	Solus sum qui facio
The time was in that day	Tempus fui in illa die
We have a good plan.	Consilium habemus bonum.
I love you so much.	Amo te tam multo.
I'll tell you what	Dicam tibi quod
It would seem that this is not so.	Videtur hoc non ita esse.
I wanted more than anything	Hoc volui plus quam aliquid
Which I rejoice.	Quod ego gaudeo.
He wanted to talk to me.	Loqui mecum voluit.
I know that you're lucky	Scio quod sis felix
But I don't like that.	Sed non ut quam.
I hope that again for us	Spero autem quod iterum ad nos
I want to get this job	Volo ut hoc officium
Man into being	Homo, in esse
I know what you like.	Quid novi placet.
I know this is the thing	Scio hoc esse rem
I could stay there all day	Ibi manere potui totum diem
I wanted so badly, so badly	Tam male volui, tam male
He was with me.	Mecum erat.
I want you to be better than me	Volo te melius esse quam me
I want to talk to you	Volo loqui tecum
You are here.	Hic es.
I could not find my father	Pater meus invenire non potui
Someone is someone who has.	Aliquis est qui habet.
I could not do this	Hoc non potui
It's the same with you.	Idem est apud te.
Will not be there again	Non ibi iterum
There is something in us.	Est aliquid in nobis.
I truly believe that	Ego vere credo quod
I didn't know anything about this	Ego nesciebam quid de hoc
I know you understand this	Hoc scio te intelligere
You know what I see very well.	Scis quod vide optime.
I could go along with him	Non potui ire per cum eo
If you think so.	Si tibi videtur.
So it is.	Ita est.
I know everything about you and everything you do	Scio omnia de te et omnia quae facturus es
I was no longer	amplius non eram.
not a lot of time.	Non multum temporis.
This is exactly what comes to mind.	Ita prorsus occurrit.
It's time to go for it.	Aliquam ut enim.
I had a plan and was prepared	Habui consilium et paratus
Or to be before.	Vel ante esse.
I have a question for everyone	Habeo quaestionem pro omnibus
I didn't say my name.	Non dicam nomen.
No one is for me	Unus non sit mihi
You only need me	Tantum opus ad me
I knew one more time	Sciebam unum futurum tempus
He said I was not alone	solus non eram dixit
I don't think you would do that.	Non puto te facturum esse.
I am a good man and father	Ego vir bonus et pater
I know how long this season is.	Scio quantum hoc temporis sit ei tempus.
And it was .	Et fuit .
Yes, always before.	Etiam in semper ante.
I thought you were	Cogitavi te esse
I didn't know what	Ego nesciebam quid
I need to see it	Mihi opus est ad eam
The race is easy.	Genus facile.
I told you what to do	Dixi vobis quod facere
This is exactly the question.	Prorsus haec quaestio est.
I thought like that's impossible	Cogitavi sicut quod est esse
Yes, that's always the same thing.	Etiam id semper ipsum.
Never that time	Numquam illo tempore
I just can't stop looking for her	Ego iustus non prohibere vultus eius
I never met him.	Numquam occurrit ei.
But this is not enough.	Sed hoc parum est.
I know what the future will be	Scio quid futurum sit
I did nothing.	Nihil non feci.
No need to work at all	Non opus est omnino opus
But it was time.	Sed tempus erat.
I just want to stop today and talk to you	EGO iustus volo prohibere hodie et loqui tecum
I believe tomorrow could be better than today.	Credo cras melius quam hodie esse posse.
I haven't seen you all day	Non vidi te totum diem
I believe that it was	Credo quod erat
I could not give it to you, not this soon	Non potui tibi dare, non hoc cito
Today is almost all.	Hodie fere omnes.
It is easy to speak, man.	Loqui facile est, homo.
It is a great thing.	Magna res est.
I'm glad that he says nothing.	Gaudeo quod nihil dicit.
This ought to be good.	Hoc bonum esse debet.
I haven't heard this one.	Hoc unum non audivi.
I don't know what to do	Nescio quid me hoc facere
I can't help you anymore.	Non possum amplius tibi adiuvare.
You know.	Scis.
She was really alone.	Solus erat vere illa.
he did not do it.	id non fecit.
I don't know what to do	Nescio quid facere
To me it was nothing more than that.	Mihi nihil aliud fuit quam illud.
I know how true it is	Scio quantum sit verum
I hope it will be so.	Spero fore ut.
He refused to think about this now.	De hoc nunc cogitare noluit.
It may not take long.	Ut non diu.
I don't know what's wrong.	Nescio quid mali.
And perhaps not.	Et fortasse non est.
I was still together	Fui tamen in una
I couldn't find anything	Non potui invenire aliquid
Nor do we.	Nec nos.
Maybe there's too much.	Fortasse nimis est ibi.
I just don't know what to do with you.	Modo nescio quid faciam tecum.
But now.	Sed nunc.
Or to some extent.	Vel aliquam ut.
There is no way that it was.	Nulla id quam erat.
it was too much, which he still did not know.	nimium erat quod adhuc nesciebat.
I could see something	Non potui videre aliquid
I can't believe him enough to go to him	Non possum credere eum satis ire ad eum
You are here for you.	Tu hic es tibi.
I need some time for me	Mihi opus est aliquo tempore ad me
I can't do it anymore	Non possum facere amplius
You need to understand something here	Hic opus est tibi intelligere aliquid
I need to be myself	Mihi opus est ut ipse
See if you can.	Vide si potes.
He was ready.	Erat paratus.
I really believe in him	Ego vere credo in eo
Maybe you'd like to see me.	Videre fortasse velis.
I guess that I should be	Suspicor ut essem
And certainly he says.	Et certe dicit.
I can't believe what you did	Non possum credere quod fecit
There is one thing to understand and to give.	Est unum intelligere et dare.
To me you are.	Ad me tu.
Now she has only one.	Nunc unum tantum habet.
Truly, truly.	Vere, vere.
She did it for me.	Illa mihi fecit.
I should probably just leave	Ut probabiliter tantum relinquere
I can't do anything	Non possum facere quicquam
If you can, it's fine for you.	Si potes, bene tibi.
This was finally done.	Hoc tandem factum est.
And no here.	Et nulla hic.
I never saw so	Numquam vidi tam
I don't want to do this	Non vis ut faciam hoc
I just want to be me.	EGO iustus volo esse me.
Always do it, always.	Semper id, semper.
I could see what you did	Non potui videre quid fecit
I'm probably lucky to have them.	Probabiliter felix sum ut illa.
Haven't been home yet	Non fuit domi adhuc
Just let me know when you're ready.	Modo cum paratus sis me scire.
I like it all	Placet illud omnibus
It seems good to me, but it does not.	Bene mihi videtur, sed non videtur.
I just wanted to stay.	Modo manere volui.
I don't know what to do here	Nescio quid hic facere
I could hear him.	Eum audire potui.
Not a lot of chance to do what you want.	Non multum forte quod vis.
It's too hard to imagine what it is like.	Nimis est difficile cogitare quid simile sit.
This is the same.	Hoc idem est.
I never got it.	Numquam obtinuit eam.
I don't want to see that	Nolo videre quod
I can get you one of us	Non possum te unum ex nobis
I know it to be.	Scio eam esse.
Thus was the journey.	Sic erat iter.
The same thing could not have been done.	Fieri non potuit idem.
I'll do it if you want	Faciam, si vis
i am looking into her face	Ego vultus in vultus eius
I want to do good at my job	Volo facere bene apud me officium
you can still win.	adhuc vincere potes.
You are right.	Recte tu.
I'm so glad to come and help.	Tam gaudeo me venire et adiuvare.
I just didn't want anyone to tell us	Ego iustus noluit quis ad nos
I wanted to know everything	Scire volui omnia
He could also hear.	Audire etiam potuit.
And that is who it is.	Et id est quis id.
I wanted more than anything now	Volui plus quam aliquid nunc
hopefully this won't be a problem.	Utinam hoc quaestio non erit.
Not so much at this time.	Non tam hoc tempore.
I hope you are more than anyone	Spero te plus quam quis
I don't know how to do this	Nescio quomodo hoc facere
I know exactly where you are from	Prorsus scio ubi es ab illo
Yes.	Ita.
The problem is not enough.	Quaestio non est satis.
But to help.	Sed ut auxilium.
I know I will not do it again.	Scio te id iterum non facturum.
Now she was behind me.	Nunc post me fuit.
I know it is possible	Scio fieri potest
All but one.	Omnes, sed unus.
And these are not.	Et haec non sunt.
I never thought it would take me a lot	Numquam putavi fore ut hoc mihi multum
I need you to have me	Mihi opus est tibi habere me
You don't have friends at all	Non habes omnino amicos
But this is not so.	Sed hoc non est ita.
I don't believe you'd come by	Non credo velis venire per
I could have a job first	Non potui habere officium primum
I would like to get it with me	Ut eam vellem mecum
I know what you are	Scio quid sis
I know what my love is	Scio quid mea sit
I wanted to tell you what	Dicere volui tibi quod
It is so difficult.	Ita difficile est.
And he said to her: As soon as he saw he was coming.	Et dixit ad eam : Ut vidit venire.
Which was the same.	Quod ipsum erat.
he could not stay still.	manere adhuc non potuit.
I could not find one	Non potui invenire unum
I don't know what day	Nescio quo die
At length it has just begun.	Tandem mox incepit.
The journey to come to me.	Iter ad me venire.
I was a little wrong about it.	Parum mali de illo fui.
I don't want it to e	Non vis eam ut e
I was really scared.	Vere eram vix.
I'm still the same guy	Ego tamen idem guy
I know this.	Scio id.
I just know.	Modo scio.
I hope to see you there!.	Spero te videre ibi !.
I wonder what's in it	Miror quid in eo
I don't know how it doesn't matter.	Nescio quomodo rem non habet.
I have seen and heard a lot	Vidi et audivi multum
We have to be better than that.	Melius habemus quam ut.
I didn't know if it was good or not	Ego nesciebam si esset bonus vel non
Yes, I don't know well.	Sic, nescio an bene.
There he saw me.	Ibi me vidit.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
Make your own.	Tuum fac.
This doesn't seem too likely.	Hoc nimis probabile non videtur.
I know I love you	Scio te amo te
I know what it was and what it was	scio quid factum sit et quid sit
I want to be with him	Volo cum eo
But who did it?	Sed quis fecit.
Perhaps he was a man.	Homo fortasse fuit.
There is nothing else that can be done.	Nihil est aliud quod fieri possit.
Nothing more for her.	Nihil amplius ad eam.
there is neither good nor evil per se.	non est bonum nec malum per se.
I need to know better	Melius scire debeo
I want to see something	Volo videre aliquid
This can be good and bad.	Hoc potest esse bonum et malum.
I can't leave alone for a time like this	Non possum solus ad tempus relinquere sic
I was a boy.	Puer fui.
It would seem that this was done.	Videtur quod hic factum sit.
None of him.	Nemo ex eo.
And certainly nothing is wrong.	Et certe nihil mali est.
I'm sure it's okay.	Certus sum bene est.
Maybe not out now.	Aliquam non ex nunc.
Can you help with this? 	Hoc adiuvare potes?
However, now everything is better to tell.	Tamen, melius omnia nunc ei narrare.
I'll tell you what you want to know.	Dicam quod vis scire.
His name is in there.	Nomen eius in ibi.
To be up too soon	Ut esse nimis cito
I said nothing that was true	nihil dixi, quod verum erat
I've been three years ago	Fui ante tres
There's going to be a plan.	Non futurum consilium.
I want to come home to you	Volo venire domum ad vos
I've been here a lot.	Fui hic multum.
I want to give you a great hug	Volo dare tibi magna amet
And another thing too.	Et aliud quoque.
I need to live on time	Mihi opus est vivere in tempore
He is my father.	Pater meus est.
and he does it.	et facit.
But that's none of it.	Sed id nulla ex.
I need to think, but there was no time	Mihi opus est cogitare, sed tempus non erat
I didn't know who it was	Ego nesciebam quis esset
He was a good man.	Vir bonus erat.
These days, everybody wants to know about everything.	Haec dies, omnes de omnibus scire vult.
I travel a lot	Ego multum iter ad
The man said he would like to know me	Homo dixit se scire me
You need to know that this is not a decision quickly.	Scire debes, hoc non cito consilium.
Which I did so.	Quod ita feci.
I know she wants to do it	Scio non vult facere
Nothing new.	Nihil novi.
We are still working	Nos adhuc opus
In that regard.	In id ipsum enim.
Something was badly wrong, but he didn't know why.	Male male erat aliquid, sed quid nesciebat.
It will be much better.	Multo melius erit.
I really don't need to do it	Ego vere non opus est ut faciam illud
In this way I have seen.	Hoc modo vidi.
I want to see her.	Volo eam videre.
I am really sorry about that	Ego sum vere paenitet quod
In some.	In aliquam.
I don't want to know more.	Nolo amplius scire.
You can't have everything.	Omnia habere non potes.
No one told me about it	Nemo indicavit mihi de illo
I would like to go there	Vellem ire illuc
Well one day.	Bene unus dies est.
This is now.	Hoc nunc est.
I guess you do.	Suspicor te facere.
To be happy tonight	Ut felix hac nocte
He gave him a name.	Nomen ei dedit.
Say it again.	Dic iterum.
I couldn't stop coming	Non potui venire prohibere
And before him.	Et ante ipsum.
I can't talk to him about it	Non possum dicere ei de eo
He likes to be honest.	Velit sit amet.
We are what we are.	Nos quod sumus.
I am very pleased	Ego sum admodum
I don't want to do anything	Non vis ei quicquam
Maybe that's enough.	Fortasse id satis est.
If anyone knows.	Si quis scit.
Looks like something else.	Simile quid aliud.
I couldn't stop it	Ut prohibere non potui
I didn't know how to say	Ego nesciebam quam dicere
I don't know what's in it.	Nescio quid in eo est.
I haven't given up	Ego non dedit usque
I don't know what this is	Nescio quid hoc sit
But he didn't like it.	Nolebat autem sic.
I never know what she thinks	Numquam quid cogitat illa
I need to talk to you about her	Mihi opus est loqui tibi de suo
Just want to do well.	Iustus volo ut bene facias.
Without me	Sine me.
All this is a plan.	Totum hoc consilium est.
I need to get it	Mihi opus est ut eam
he saw what was done.	vidit quod factum est.
I've seen it happen.	Ego vidi fieri.
I certainly hope you've never been	Ego certe spero te numquam fuisse
I don't go to school.	Non ad scholam.
I tried to understand what happened recently	Conatus sum intelligere quod nuper factum est
But it is not enough.	Sed non satis est.
This is the only time that's coming to me.	Hoc unum est quod ad me venit tempore.
I don't like it	Ego autem non placet
No one like him.	Nulla quis similis ipsum.
Not really sure if it's too much or too little.	Non vere certe si multum vel parum est.
This means a lot to me.	Hoc est multum mihi.
Now we are.	Nunc sumus.
Yes, but it is great.	Etiam sed magna est.
Evil, evil, evil.	Malum, malum, malum.
I always have with me.	Semper habeo mecum.
Or this was done.	Vel hoc factum.
I know you don't have	Scio te non habere
I could totally see what it was	Non potui prorsus videre quid esset
I have this question	Ego hanc quaestionem
it is not yet.	non est tamen.
I want to think about it	Volo cogitare de illo
I wonder if you can see me	Miror si me videre
I wonder what you did there	Miror quid ibi fecerit
I am surprised too	Miror etiam ipse
I love you too, my love	Te amo etiam, mea
I've just forgotten	Ego nuper oblitus
I didn't tell her too much	Et non indicavit ei nimis
I'm not sure about where you started	Non sum certus de quo incepit
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
I will be my self again	Ego mea se iterum
It's hard for me to go to school.	Difficile est mihi ad scholam ire.
It is more.	Plus eft.
I think that's where I am	Puto quod ubi sum
All I need to see is to know exactly what's happened	Mihi opus est omnia videre, prorsus scire quid acciderit
I want you there to understand that	Volo te ibi intelligere quod
he did not know who it was.	nesciebat quis esset.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum ex.
I knew he wanted	Sciebam se velle
I'm not really thinking	Ego non vere cogitas
I will tell him.	Dicam ei.
and in the morning	et mane.
A little while ago he was giving	A paulo ante dare erat
Nothing is nothing.	Nihil est nihil.
All I need is to stop	Mihi opus est omnia ad prohibere
But that was how.	Sed id erat quam.
It's not okay to be here.	Non est hic bene esse.
I like to be with you	Mihi placet esse apud te
I told you what you tried before	Dixi vobis, quod ante conatus est
think to go together.	simul ire puto.
It's not what he wants.	Etiam non quam velit.
Maybe he saw me.	Me vidit fortasse.
He thinks he knows everything.	Scire se putat omnia.
Yes that is.	Ita ut est.
If you want, we can find it.	Si vis, possumus invenire.
I told her what I wanted to give	Ego ei quod voluit dare
He wanted me to do something.	A me aliquid voluit.
Now see where it is.	Nunc vide ubi sit.
And he does it rightly.	Et recte facit.
I told you this	Dixi vobis quod hoc
I could not find anything.	Non potui invenire aliquid.
I wanted to play now	Ludere nunc volui
I am sure of it now	Certus sum ex eo nunc
You can't talk to me anymore.	Mihi iam loqui non potes.
I really like you in everything you want to be	Ego vere similis in omnibus vis esse
It was not good.	Non erat bonum.
I have seen and seen nothing	Vidi et vidi nihil
I just don't.	Ego iustus facio.
I just want to do everything	Ego iustus volo facere omnia
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
The matter is so.	Ita res est.
Do the same.	Idem fac.
And this would be true.	Et hoc verum esset.
nothing to him	Nihil ei
I haven't seen it.	Non vidi eam.
I love him, I love him very much.	Eum amo, valde amo.
I just don't know how it was	Ego nescio quomodo iustus erat
i can see.	videre possum.
he could not do it.	facere potuit.
It is to do so.	Est id.
This was the day.	Hic fuit dies.
I can't say what you mean	Non possum dicere quod vis
don't do this to you	Non hoc tibi
This is	Hoc est.
I have seen, but only do not believe	Vidi, sed solum non credere
Me not so good.	Me, non ita bonum.
Even in the past.	Etiam in erat ante.
Do my job.	Fac officium meum.
I have to do the same	Habeo facere idem
Too quickly.	Nimis cito.
I could not hear him	Eum audire non potui
Even before that.	Etiam ante quam.
I've done it before	Feci ante
I always believe this	Semper credo hoc
He said he seemed better.	Dixit se melius videri.
I try my best to help you	Ego meum ad auxilium te
No one is better than this.	Nemo hoc melius est.
I just want to play	Ego iustus volo ludere
You will do well.	Bene facturus es.
i am just thinking about that	Ego iustus cogitas quod
He knows his business very well.	Suam rem nimis bene novit.
I didn't want to stop.	Non quod vellet prohibere.
I am here.	Hic ego sum.
I think something has happened to me wrong	Puto quod factum est ad me malum
People don't see me.	Homines non me.
I don't feel anything this time	Non sentio aliquid hoc tempore
I can't go through it	Non possum ire per eam
To or to some extent.	Ut vel aliquam quam.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
I need time to think	Mihi opus tempus cogitare
I hope you can get to	Spero te potest ut
I need something to do	Mihi opus est aliquid facere
I see about me	Video de me
I can see how he did it	Videre possum quomodo id faceret
I can't think for all	Non possum cogitare pro omnibus
I guess what	Suspicor quid
I didn't want it to happen	Nolui enim fieri
still don't know how this could be done	adhuc nescio quomodo id fieri potuit
I could not believe it.	Credere non potui.
We can help.	Adiuvare possumus.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
Hardly have I seen more	Vix vidi amplius
I couldn't do anything that you said	Non potui ne aliquid quod dixit
But not only him.	Sed non nisi ipsum.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I knew what it was but	Sciebam quid esset, sed
I owe you great	Magna debeo
Maybe it doesn't have to be there.	Forsitan esse ibi non habet.
Man too	Homo quoque
I didn't know what to do	Et ego nesciebam quid de hoc facerem
I have to find him.	Habeo invenire eum.
He is gone now.	Abiit nunc.
Certainly I did.	Certe feci.
I can give you	Non possum dare tibi
I certainly don't need it	Ego certe non opus est
I just didn't know what to do	Ego iustus nesciebam quid facere
He ought to do a lot of things.	Multum facere debet.
I hope this goes well with you	Spero hoc bene tecum
It was really good.	Vere bonum erat.
Not that great.	Non ut magna.
I want to be with you.	Volo tecum esse.
I just know the truth	Ego iustus scio verum
I'm so sorry.	Ita me paenitet.
I wanted you to know this.	Hoc te scire volui.
I could not stay	Non potui manere
He always wants to do all things for himself.	Omnia sibi facere semper vult.
Do this today.	Hoc fac hodie.
I can't do it	Non faciam posse
It is possible that this is so.	Fieri potest ut ita sit hic.
I could barely see anything	Vix aliquid videre potui
I need to discuss it	Mihi opus est de eo
He doesn't have to chat with anyone unless he wants to.	Loqui cum aliquo non habet nisi vellet.
Look that way.	Vide illuc.
You need to know.	Scire debes.
I didn't know how to act	Nesciebam quomodo agere
I could not understand	Non potui intelligere
Yes you perhaps.	Etiam tu fortasse.
There was no time for that.	Nulla id tempus erat.
I want to believe you	Volo te credere
Well, not people per se.	Bene, non homines per se.
For him!.	Pro eo!.
I thought I would be you	Putavi fore te
But it is not the same.	Sed non ipsum est.
I'll do it if you like.	Faciam, si tibi.
He does nothing with me, he is not mine.	Nihil mecum agit, non est meus.
He was not there yet.	Non tamen ibi erat.
I never did that man	Numquam fecit ut homo
But that's not too much.	Sed id ipsum non nimis.
That was perhaps good.	Quod erat fortasse bonum.
Maybe that's a lot for someone.	Quod fortasse multum est ad aliquem.
I never thought it was	Numquam cogitavi erat
never before.	numquam quam.
I have it at home.	id domi habeo.
Not that the thing is.	Non quod res sit.
That you know a little.	Quod scis parum.
Maybe longer.	Forsitan diutius.
He can talk if he wants.	Loqui potest si vult.
You get there soon.	Tu illuc primum.
I know what you're thinking.	Id me scire et tu cogitare.
Well, but not enough.	Bene, sed non satis.
You can't do better.	Melius non potes.
So the man will get sick.	Sic erit homo male.
I had to do something soon	Ego quoque ad aliquid cito
I could see it like that	Non potui videre eam sicut quod
I could not do this without you	Hoc facere non potui sine te
I am late, late	Ego sum nuper, sero
I can't think of anything	Non possum aliquid cogitare de
I just know what you want to do	Ego iustus scio quod hoc facere velis
I said I was nothing	Dixi me esse nihil
it does not please.	non placet.
You can only hear.	Tantum audire potes.
He also wants it.	Etiam id velit.
And the father.	Et pater.
I haven't been home yet	Non fuit domi sed vel
I have to live my love	Habeo vivere mea
I need too much to see what is going on.	Nimium opus est ut quid eat.
Now I'm sure	Nunc certus sum
You've done a lot	Multum fecisti
I want you to think about it	Volo te cogitare de illo
I thought I would do the same	Et cogitavi ut idem facerem
I think we'll be fine with your help	Puto nos erit bene cum auxilio
That's it now.	Id nunc est.
I wonder if I ever mean	Miror si semper vult
I was certain.	Certum fui.
I know when someone comes to him	Scio quod aliquis venit ad illum
I know him well	Ego scio illum bene
I want to go to something	Volo ire ut aliquid
I'm with him my chance	Ego cum eo forte mea
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
Always got the job done	Semper obtinuit officium fieri
It's not the first time	Non est primum
I'm not sure why it is.	Non sum certus cur ita sit.
All these are mine.	Haec omnia mea sunt.
I'll tell you something.	Dicam quid.
I could do your help, indeed	Auxilium tuum facere potui, vere
It was said.	Dictum fuit.
He says no to him.	Dicit ei nulla.
I know what he knows.	Scio quod scit.
I wanted to give you something to do	Volui dare tibi aliquid facere
It was the first time in him.	Primum in illo fuit.
But I have all those things and are good	Habeo tamen omnia illa et bona sunt
I knew something was wrong	Sciebam quid esset malum
But not before.	Sed non ante.
I don't have time.	Non habeo tempus.
That was the same thing.	Id ipsum erat.
Never let me do anything.	Numquam me facere quicquam.
I don't believe you're still alone	Non tamen credo te solum adhuc
I hope it will be so	Spero fore ut ita sit
This is what is good for all.	Hoc est quod bonum est omnibus.
It has been a long time.	Non diu fuit.
I want to stay where I was	Volo manere ubi erat
I hope you don't play with me	Spero autem non ludere mihi
I would not do it unless it was necessary	Non facerem nisi necesse esset
Yes or it was that.	Etiam vel erat quam.
This could not have been done.	Hoc fieri non potuit.
This cannot be.	Hoc esse non potest.
You do well with men.	Bene facis tibi homines.
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
I will do all that	Faciam omnia, quae
and certainly better.	et certe melius.
But he can.	Sed potest .
I have money.	Pecuniam mihi habeo.
I have always seen how this happens	Semper vidi quomodo id fieri
Now you probably need it.	Nunc probabiliter opus est.
Maybe it started with a name.	Forsitan ita nomen incepit.
That's what you've done.	Ut quid feceris.
This seems unlikely.	Hoc probabile videtur.
Not much problem	Non multum quaestio
But it was not enough, it was never enough.	Sed parum erat, nunquam satis erat.
Rightly indeed.	Recte quidem.
I would do it the first time in the morning.	Mane primum id facerem.
I know it's not true	Scio non verum
I need him	Mihi opus est ei
I knew where to find	Sciebam ubi invenire
There was not much time.	Non multum tempus erat.
This is going to happen.	Hoc futurum est.
I just can't do it yet	Ego iustus non potest facere sed
But they are pretty good.	Sed satis bona sunt.
I need to see you alone as soon as possible	Mihi opus est te videre solum, quam primum
I know this is the day	Scio hoc est dies
I've never done it before.	Nunquam ante feci.
She asked to do what I wanted	Rogavit facere volui
Years.	An nos.
I have class tomorrow	Habeo genus cras
I listen to something	Ego audire aliquid
This day is very busy.	Is dies est valde occupatus.
I can't get enough of him	Non possum satis ab eo
But soon it will be home for good now.	Sed mox domi erit in bonum, nunc.
I thought about you a lot too.	Cogitavi de te multum etiam.
I would like one	Vellem unum
It looks good.	Bene videtur.
I don't need to think.	Non opus est cogitare.
I thought only.	Cogitavi modo.
I couldn't get enough of everything in	Non potui satis omnia in
I've never seen better.	Nunquam vidi melius.
But it is necessary.	Sed necesse est.
I can't believe what you just said	Non possum credere quod modo dictum
I never did that before	Numquam fecit quod ante
I did it before and after, but not in time	Ante et post feci, sed non in tempore
I hope I can go without me	Spero posse ire sine me
I know you don't want to.	Scio te non velle.
I have one question today	Habeo unum quaestionem hodie
He said not.	Dixit non.
Well, probably not.	Bene, verisimile non est.
I thought it was behind me	Cogitavi fuit post me
I believe so.	Ita credo.
And he would not hear.	Et nolebat audire.
Not the first time for sure.	Non primum certe.
I'm sure you don't want me	Certus sum non vis mihi
Or to give.	Vel dare.
I know you also know.	Scio te quoque scire.
i want to do something about it.	aliquid de illo volo.
But that's not the only plan.	Sed id ipsum non solum consilium.
I could not see.	Non potui videre.
I want something for it	Volo aliquid ad eam
For he knew if it was.	Sciebat enim, si esset.
I would never say yes	Ut nunquam dixit quod sic
It is neither great nor bad.	Nec magna nec malum.
No one ever refused to play with me.	Nemo umquam mecum ludere noluit.
I really think you do	Ego vere cogitare facit
Not only no more	Non solum non amplius
Now it's definitely a plan.	Nunc certe consilium est.
This is never certain.	Numquam id certum est.
He is the same.	Idem ille.
I just don't have time.	Ut non nunc enim.
Please do something.	Aliquid facere velit.
He's not.	Non ille.
I only know what happened	Ego tantum scio quod factum est
never left him	Non reliquit eum
It does not please.	Non placet.
I just didn't want to go with him	Ego iustus noluit ire cum eo
You can only speak.	Modo potes dicere.
I know a guy who knows a guy	Scio enim guy qui scit a guy

was.	erat.
I'll never be there again	Ego numquam ibi iterum
I think you have.	Puto habere.
We can go both ways.	Utrumque possumus ire.
It is too much.	Nimium est.
When indeed it was not so.	Quando quidem sic non erat.
I never thought so much about myself either.	Numquam me vel valde putavi.
Not sure if this is possible.	Non certe si hoc modo fieri potest.
I don't believe that	Non credo quod
I think we're all that	Puto nos omnes quod
i think his days are behind him now	Puto dies eius post eum nunc
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
I haven't done it yet	Non feci tamen
it was great.	magna erat.
Probably knew this morning.	Probabiliter hoc mane scivit.
You have what you need.	Habes quod debes.
I want to see if this will work	Volo videre, si hoc erit opus
I just couldn't do it all	Modo non potuit facere, id totum
It was great.	Erat magna.
Right in this way.	Recte hoc modo.
I think he wants to swim	Puto velle natare
That's how it looked.	Id quomodo videbatur.
I feel sick just thinking about that	Sentio male iustus cogitas quod
Well he has to say what he wants to say.	Bene habet dicere quod vult dicere.
I just heard yesterday	Ego iustus heri audivi
I just saw what you did to me	Ego iustus vidi quod fecit mihi
I'm glad to meet you	Gaudeo quod tibi occurrit

To say yes.	Sic dicere.
The first time it was with you.	Primum tempus factum est apud te.
I am a teacher through and through.	Ego sum magister, per et per.
I've done it for you.	Ego feci vobis.
That's what I need.	Quod opus est.
I don't see this happening.	Hoc non video fieri.
I want to do my best.	Volo me optime facere.
Do this for yourself.	Hoc fac tuum.
This is what you do that makes you good.	Hoc est illud quod facis, quod te bonum facit.
I thought it was very good	Putavi valde bona
She was thirty-three.	Triginta fuit tres.
I wonder what he thinks of me now	Miror quid nunc de me cogitat
He doesn't know what happened to you.	Nescit quid tibi acciderit.
It was lunch.	Prandium fuit.
I love you, but not so I love you.	amo te, sed non sic amo.
I want to deal with him too.	Cum illo quoque volo agere.
There's more I could give him	Ibi plus potui ei
I never did that either.	Numquam id quidem.
It is not for you.	Non est tibi.
You have done enough.	Satis fecisti.
What I could do	Quid facere potui
Even now, not him.	Etiam nunc, non ipsum.
But at least he could not know.	Sed certe nescire potuit.
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla nisi.
I hope you find it	Spero te invenire eam
I never asked to come here	Numquam rogavit huc venire
he thought.	putavit.
It can never happen.	Fieri numquam potest.
I want to see it	Ego vis videre eam

This is hardly likely	Hoc est vix verisimile

Maybe not from him.	Aliquam non ex ipsum.
This one does.	Hoc unum facit.
I just play with it.	Modo ludere cum illo.
But you never know.	Sed numquam scis.
I wanted to do this	Hoc volui facere
I was there but not there	Ibi eram, sed non ibi
I didn't think so	Non cogitavi ut
He was not here either.	Hic vel non erat.
She just wants to be with me.	Sicut vult illa mecum esse.
Not to me indeed.	Non ad me quidem.
I certainly don't want that to be.	Ego certe id esse nolo.
That's pretty much it.	Id satis multa est.
I hope all is well with him	Spero omnia bene cum eo
which I have not yet been able to do.	quod me facere nondum potui.
I have already told you.	iam tibi dixi.
I know what you are doing	Scio quid hoc facit

I heard enough.	Satis audivi.
Even more so than before.	Etiam non quam ante.
I had to do this work	Ego quoque ad hoc opus

I told him that it was true	Dixi ei quod esset verum
But it's still true.	Sed verum tamen.
Happy to talk to you today	A te hodie Felix loqui
I never want to see you	Numquam vis videre vos
That's not so easy.	Quod non tam facile.
If so he did not.	Si ita non fecit.
I wasn't there this year	Non eram ibi hoc anno
which I knew now.	quod nunc sciebam.
I think you are a good one	Puto te unum bonum esse
I didn't want to deal with any of this	Nolui agere cum aliquo hoc

He knows what it means to be me and you.	Novit quid sit me et te esse.
But not soon enough.	Sed non satis cito.
It is not.	Non est.
I didn't really forget about it	Oblitus non sum de eo, non vere

I haven't thought like that before	Non cogitavi ut ante
A lot has not been done	Multum non factum
He does not come.	Non venit.
Not really.	Non vere est.
Not much.	Non multum.
You don't want to leave	Non vis relinquere
I never wanted.	Numquam volui.

I can't do these things.	Haec facere non possum.
I have nothing to live	Non habeo quod vivere
I can't believe that	Non possum credere quod

He can't give it.	Non potest eam dare.
Please come to me.	Quaeso, ad me.

This alone will not work.	Hoc solum opus non erit.

It certainly is gone.	Eo certe abiit.
This is certainly possible.	Hoc certe fieri potest.
It looks like.	Is vultus amo.
I saw him.	Vidi eum.
I know that it is mine.	Meum esse scio.
I think that's very important	Puto quod valde magna
I don't want to tell anyone	Non volo dicere quis
No one wants to talk to me.	Nemo mecum loqui vult.
I think you need your advice	Puto te consilium tuum opus
That never happened.	Id numquam.
And that's the same thing.	Et id ipsum.
I told my mom him	Dixi meum, ei
I heard good things	Audivi bona sunt
I just want to hear it	Ego iustus volo audire eum
I need to find a job	Mihi opus est invenire officium
I didn't want to be here anymore	Nolui esse hic amplius

I don't need to know what I need	Non opus est scire quid opus est
I want something else this time	Volo aliquid aliud hoc tempore
I just can't think of it now	Ego iustus potest non cogitare eam nunc
I doubt he ever had	Dubito ille umquam habuit

But it is important to be great.	Sed sit amet magna.
You forgot me wrong	Malum me oblitus es
I didn't think it was there.	Non putavi ibi esse.
I never said it.	numquam id dixi.
I don't want to know more	Nolo scire amplius
That has to be.	Quod habet esse.
I can't see us becoming friends	Non possum videre nos amicos fieri
I knew I would never do something like this again	Sciebam nunquam aliquid simile hoc iterum
I don't want to even think about it.	Nolo quidem cogitare.
I wanted him to be.	ipsum esse volui.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.

I thought about it before	Cogitavi de illo ante
And it's time to be very happy.	Aliquam et ipsum sit amet ipsum.
There is not enough time.	Non satis est temporis.
Yes, advice.	Etiam, consilium.
You don't have any time.	Et non aliquam tempore.

These days are not so much.	Haec dies non tam.
I knew for sure	Sciebam certe
I just want you to know it's okay	EGO iustus volo te scire, bene est
Only now I realized something	Tantum nunc intellexit aliquid
No will, no need.	Non vult, non opus est.
i never did anything about it and now it is gone	numquam aliquid de eo feci et nunc abiit
As I heard before	Sicut ante me audivi
Hardly to do so.	Vix id.
I just want you to know	EGO iustus volo te scire
Not bad for him.	Non ei malum.
I could understand a lot better	Multum melius intelligere potui
But that's not the same thing.	Sed id ipsum non.
We're really lucky.	Vere felix sumus.
He saw them all.	Omnes vidit.
I could not even hear	Audire etiam non potui
I will not say much about him.	Non multa de illo dicam.
I don't have anything to say	Non habeo quod dicam
But it is so.	Sed ita est.
You have to want.	Habes velle.
I had the whole plan.	Totum consilium habui.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
don't even swim with him	Non etiam natare cum eo
I've never met him.	Ego ei non occurrit.
I saw my name	Vidi nomen meum
He didn't want to do this.	Noluit hoc facere.
They don't stop there.	Non sunt prohibere.
as he who knows you knows.	sicut qui scit te novit.
I will never be okay again.	Ego numquam bene sit iterum.
Tell him, not him.	Dic eum, non illum.
not long here anymore	Non diu hic amplius
I just bought mine yesterday	Ego iustus meus heri emit
It's just a thought.	Suus iustus cogitavi.
I don't want to do anything	Nolo facere quicquam
He was scared.	Vix et erat.
There is none here.	Hic nulla est.
I'm not sure how.	Non sum certus quomodo.
It has been quite a day.	Non fuit satis in die.
But this is true.	Sed hoc est verum.
Time	Tempus .
I didn't want to be able to talk	Nolui loqui posse
I can't think of it	Non possum me cogitare de illo
I only knew what I needed	Tantum sciebam quod mihi opus erat
People too, too much.	Homines nimis, nimium.
That's one thing.	Id unum.
But he would do what he could.	Sed facturum quod potuit.
This can be what you want.	Hoc potest esse quod vis.
I really, you know	Ego vere, tu scis
I'll tell you why he came	Dicam cur venit
I just want to win it.	Ego iustus volo eam vincere.
And not right.	Et non recte.
It will probably be.	Probabile autem erit.
I wanted to be I wanted	Volui esse volui
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
By i video	Per ego video
I like to live on my own now	Ego similis vivere in mea modo
how to tell you.	quam tibi dicere.
It was true.	Verum erat.
I love to be with you.	Te amo esse apud te.

I'm with him longer than you	Ego cum eo diutius quam tu
I need your help here	Hic opus auxilium tuum
I want this e	Volo hoc e
I can't quite understand this	Hoc possum satis intelligere
No one got hurt.	Nemo malum obtinuit.
We totally wanted to stay there	Volui nos manere prorsus illuc
Her plan was to go tonight.	Consilium erat ei hac nocte ire.
I completely forgot	Omnino oblitus sum
I still can't believe that myself	Ego tamen non possum credere quod ipse
I barely feel it	Vix sentio
I don't doubt too much	Non dubito nimium
I am the only one that I know is possible.	Ego enim unus scio quod fieri potest.
But they are not.	Sed non sunt.
Even more than he wants.	Etiam nec quam velit.
It will certainly help.	Adiuvet certe.
He wanted to believe in him.	Credere ei voluit.
I know this is great for you	Scio hoc tibi magna
Someone comes from.	Aliquis venit a.
I was alone.	Solus eram.
I knew for sure	Sciebam pro certo
As it was years ago.	Ut sit ante annos.
He knows now.	Scit nunc.
Which is not so.	Quod non ita est.
And that will be enough for him.	Et pro eo, quod satis erit.
It is bad.	Malum est.
I really, really wanted to be	Ego vere, vere volui fieri
There is something wrong with me.	Est aliquid mali apud me.
It's not just me talking.	Hoc non modo mecum loquitur.
You did not do this.	Hoc facere non fecisti.
There is nothing.	Nihil eft.
I know a little about you	Scio parum de te
You know that you are.	Scis te esse.
He refused to say it.	Noluit id dicere.
I'm very sorry	Valde me paenitet
Maybe it was done.	Forsitan ita factum est.
That is not true.	Quod non est.
I don't know what's wrong	Nescio quid mali
Would that he could come with us	Utinam nobiscum venire posset
a lot of money	Multum pecuniae
I hope that's true	Spero quod verum est
I just can't see the problem.	Modo non potest videre quaestionem.
yes that's no good enough.	Etiam id nulla satis.
i knew him and i knew why he was there	eum scivi et scivi quare ibi esset
I was there before.	Ibi ante essem.
Not before.	Nec ante.
A guy that was like this with me	A guy non fuit sic apud me
I knew what was going to happen	Sciebam quid futurum sit
I wonder why you are here	Miror cur hic
He could not speak.	Loqui non potuit.
He does this good work.	Hoc bonum opus facit.
I know nothing but this.	nihil nisi hoc scio.
That's what he wanted.	Id voluit.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
and from yours.	et ex tua.
I am not going to do it	Non facturus est
he is not here now.	non est hic nunc.
I really did work this job	Ego vere hoc opus fecit officium
It is like .	Est sicut .
I watched to see how it was done	Vidi video quomodo factum est
Yes, that was the time.	Etiam ut tempus erat.
I certainly needed him	Ego certe opus erat eum
I'm trying to talk to me	Me conatur loqui in me est
I can't do it for you.	Non possum te facere.
Too bad, really.	Nimis malum, vere.
You will be so happy.	Tam felix erit.
This video is always in me	Hoc in me semper video
Not the first time either.	Nec primum vel.
I don't know how we went that day	Nescio quomodo nos illo die
Something like that.	Aliquid simile quod.
You are a man after all.	Homo es post omnes.
I don't want people to see me that way.	Nolo me homines illuc videre.
He could not understand things.	Res intelligere non potuit.
Let no one help me.	Nemo me adiuvet.
I want to make it happen	Volo enim me facere futurum
You need something else.	Aliud tibi opus est.
He should not go.	Ire non debet.
i think i could have	Puto posse habere
All i can do is well.	Omnia possum facere bene.
I want something done	Volo aliquid factum
I need to talk to real friends	Mihi opus est loqui ad verum amicos
Not great, but not either.	Non magna, sed nec vel.
Yes that's one thing.	Etiam id unum.
Help is necessary.	Necesse est auxilium.
and in some way.	et aliquo modo.
I did my work and did it	Ego feci opus meum et fecit
I need you.	Mihi opus est tibi.
But not before.	Sed nec ante quam.
Maybe it's something.	Fortasse aliquid est.
But this work does not appear.	Sed hoc opus non videtur.
It was necessary, however.	Necesse erat tamen.
I guess this may not have been true	Suspicor hoc non fuisse verum
he knew what was going to happen.	sciebat quid futurum esset.
I still know enough	Ego tamen satis scio quod
But not often.	Sed non saepe.
I could not believe it.	Credere non potui.
but to us.	sed ad nos.
The thing did so.	Res ita fecit.
I never wanted time to	Numquam volui tempus ut
And you know me well.	Et tu scis a me bene.
I just don't tell anyone	Ego iustus ne quis dicere
You don't want to do it, but someone else has.	Non vis tibi facere, sed aliquis habet.
There is none.	Nemo est.
I am a very happy boy	Sum valde felix puer
I don't want to get in there	Non vis ut in ibi
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
There was nothing in me.	Nihil erat in me.
I know you still have it	Scio adhuc habere eam
I thought you too	Cogitavi tu quoque
Something, but not enough.	Aliquid, sed parum.
We do not have.	Non habemus.
I have a lot of work to do	Ego autem multum opus facere
Nothing I can do about this now	De hoc nunc nihil possum facere
I never saw him like this	Numquam vidi illum sic
i think it is okay	Puto ut bene sit
This is what no one ever did years ago.	Hoc est quod nemo umquam ante annos fecit.
But it is not for me to say.	Sed dicere non est mihi.
Just do what you want.	Tantum quod vis ut facias.
I'm glad that it's for us.	Gaudeo quod pro nobis est.
That certainly did.	Id certe fecit.
What was that.	Quid erat illud.
I never even knew he was there	Numquam etiam scivi eum ibi esse
A little while ago	Paulo ante tempus
And I could not	Et non potui
How can it be done.	Quomodo fieri potest.
Never let someone tell me like this	Numquam aliquis ad me sic
I really don't understand what she's talking about	Ego vere non intelligere quod illa de
Look this way.	Vide hoc modo.
Didn't know what to say to you.	Nesciebat quid dicam tibi.
But not what he says.	Sed non id quod dicit.
Now I see what it is	Nunc video quid sit
There is so much time ahead of you.	Est tantum tempus ante te.
I don't know how yet.	Nescio quomodo adhuc.
I need one for a long time.	Unum diu opus est tibi.
I know you don't have to do something like this	Scio te non aliquid simile hoc facere
I wanted this between us.	Hoc volui inter nos.
I haven't seen or heard anyone.	Non vidi vel audivi aliquem.
But not great.	Sed non magna.
Which is great.	Quo magna.
I really can't get it	Ego vere non potest accipere
I heard it	Audivi eam
I need to find something, somehow	Aliquid invenire debeo, aliquo modo
I think we ought to talk	Puto nos debere loqui
I wanted to be honest.	Volui sit amet.
Maybe someone knows better.	Forsitan melius aliquem nescit.
glad to hear it	gaudeo audire illud
I have to go see it	Habeo ire videre eam
That's how it started, really.	Id quomodo incepit, vere.
I have seen you and heard you	Vidi te, et audivi te
Not after this morning.	Non post hoc mane.
I wanted to see this house	Hoc volui videre domum
Haven't had it before	Non habuit ante
I wanted to post this here.	Hoc volui ut hic post.
You are not thinking correctly.	Non recte cogitas.
You don't look very good tonight.	Non vide ipsum bonum hac nocte.
I think so	Ego cogitare est
But this is not what was done here.	Sed hoc non est quod hic factum est.
It seemed easy.	Facile videbatur.
All in itself.	Totum in se ipsum.
It was really great for me	Erat vere valde a me
I just want you to be better, that's all	EGO iustus volo vos melius esse, id totum
But that's what you fight for.	Sed id quod pro.
It can stay where it is.	Potest manere ubi est.
I don't know what to think	Nescio quid cogitare
You can do the same.	Idem facere potes.
If anything, you're fine.	Si quid, nimium bene.
This has been done.	Hoc factum est.
We have too many things.	Multa etiam habemus.
he could not do it.	facere potuit.
I can do it for you	Non possum facere vobis
It is true, .	Verum, .
It was never said.	Numquam dictum est.
I did, but I did not.	Ego feci, sed non feci.
This was the day.	Hic fuit dies.
I know that both are well	Scio enim utrumque bene est
Guy from this morning.	Guy ex hoc mane.
I don't see you there	Non video te ibi
He said that he wanted to talk to me.	Dixit se velle me loqui.
None from any save.	Nulla a aliquam nisi.
It is getting better.	Questus est bonum.
But he is a good man.	Sed vir bonus est.
I can't really see anything else	Non possum vere videre aliquid aliud
I really think a lot of it	Ego vere cogitare multum eius
You never know who can be there.	Numquam tu scis quis ibi esse possit.
I don't feel anything like that from him	Non sentio quicquam simile quod ex eo
I only think of myself as	Tantum cogitare de me quod
but he knew that it would be enough.	sed satis fore sciebat.
And again he went away.	Et iterum abiit.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Noluit loqui mihi.
Please do it with me	Placet facere mecum
I don't feel anything	Non sentio quicquam
It has nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem habet.
I saw there was	Vidi ibi erat
I love it.	Amo id.
I feel and want to say more about it	De eo sentio et volo dicere
It can always be better	Potest semper melius
What you want but not what you want.	Quod vis sed non vis.
I am not going to do that.	Quod non facturus sum.
I don't want to say.	Nolo dicere.
We all certainly did.	Certe omnes nos fecisse.
Rightly said.	Recte dixit.
I don't like that.	Non sicut ille.
He was in .	Erat in .
My father refused.	Pater meus noluit.
I can see you in school	Non possum te in scholam
Both of these cannot be true.	Utrumque verum esse non potest.
But this is not true either.	Sed vel hoc non est.
It was good to know.	Hoc erat bonum scire.
it was his car.	currus eius erat.
I could not leave here by himself	Non potui hic per se ipsum relinquere
I can't stop coming	Non possum me venire prohibere
I couldn't go on much longer	Ire non potui multo diutius
He said to him.	Dixit ei.
I don't like looking	Et non sicut vultus
You probably shouldn't even have said this.	Probabile ne id quidem dixisse.
He did it badly.	Male eum fecit.
I'm sure you mean to me	Certus sum ut vis ad me
I knew you didn't go	Sciebam te non ire
I know what is true	Scio quid verum sit
I could not accept that	Non potui accipere quod
I don't know what it is	Nescio quid sit
I need you right now with me	Hic opus est tibi nunc mecum
I just want to hear from you	Ego iustus volo te audire hoc
You can do your job.	Potes facere tuum.
It does not please.	Non placet.
But this is not true.	Hoc autem non est verum.
That's the meaning	Illa sibi vult
Well, not too hard.	Bene, non difficile.
But it was not the same thing.	Sed non dictum ipsum.
This boy.	Hic puer.
He knows something.	Qui aliquid nescit.
Nothing was said except that.	Nulla id dictum nisi.
Now that's only good.	Nunc non nisi bonum esse.
That was not his job.	Quod non erat officium suum.
Now that will be enough.	Nunc id satis erit.
I wanted to talk to you	Volui loqui ad vos
he says.	dicit.
This seems to be true.	Hoc verum videtur.
You can't do this.	Hoc sic facere non potes.
I really don't know why me	Ego vere nesciebam cur me
I don't want to live there with her	Nolo ibi vivere cum illa
No, it was not enough.	Non, parum erat.
I couldn't be here for that long	Fieri hic non potui quod diu
I really don't know	Ego vere nescio
Maybe it is one day.	Forsitan dies unus sit.
I believe we're coming for dinner	Credo nos cenam aliquam venire
To speak, to speak, to speak.	Loqui, loqui, loqui.
i have an.	habeo an.
But it is difficult by counsel.	Sed difficile est per consilium.
As it was now.	Ut nunc erat.
Maybe it's not.	Aliquam non est.
A lot to be done	Multum fieri
He was very happy for us.	Erat nobis amet ipsum.
i never saw her.	numquam eam vidi.
Which indeed is very bad.	Quod quidem valde malum est.
I didn't think through everything	Per omnia non putavi
I know exactly what to do now	Prorsus scio quid nunc facere
Not really.	Non vere est.
I know what time is	Scio quod tempus sit
But only to us.	Sed non nisi nobis.
To us, it was.	Ut nobis, erat.
Nothing else can.	Aliud non potest.
But it looks bad.	Sed spectat malum.
I've always been like this	Ego semper sic fui
Before and after.	Ante et post.
The future is gone now.	Futurum nunc abiit.
I think you know.	Scire puto.
i think that was just fine	Puto quod erat sicut bene
From you.	Ex te.
They are together in this.	Simul in hoc sunt.
So I have to go.	Sic habeo ire.
I can't get more than this	Non possum plus accipere hoc
It will be more likely next time.	Verisimile erit iterum plus.
I didn't know anything about it	Ego nesciebam quid de illo
I couldn't believe me	Non potui credere me
Yep, too good to be true.	Vidi, nimium bonum esse verum.
I hope that for a long time	Spero autem quod diu
how happy she was.	quam felix illa fuit.
It wasn't that much.	Non quod multum fuit.
This is the first time	Hoc primum
There was no success.	Res nulla fuit.
All I can do is get you done.	Omnia possum te facere quod vis fieri.
Maybe it was.	Fortasse erat.
I just thought to help my job	Ego iustus cogitavi ut adiuvet me officium
I don't know what to think or say	Nescio quid cogitare vel dicere
I didn't know what to do	Ego nesciebam quid facerem
But this was certain.	Sed hoc erat certum.
I had to get it at last.	Habui ad eam tandem.
I don't know his name.	Nescio nomen eius.
I want her more than anything else now	Volo eam plus quam aliud nunc
If he did.	Si fecerit.
Right, you can.	Recte, potes.
I have many things in my life	ego autem multa in mea
I can't stay at home	Domi manere non possum

I'm going to help her	Ego ad auxilium eius
But we are in him.	Sed nos in eo sumus.
There is more.	Plus est.
I don't believe anyone else do	Non credere quis aliud facere

I wonder if she does	Miror si haec facit
Now he understood what he meant.	Nunc intellexit quid sibi vellet.
I am surprised at you	Miror apud te
All to you.	Omnes ad vos.
I thought to myself	Ipse putavi

I wasn't really sure what it was	Ego vere non erat certus quid esset
It does not please.	Non placet.
Yes I will.	Ita volo.
Maybe very much.	Fortasse valde.
That's what he really wants.	Id quod vere vult.
I couldn't believe it from me	Non potui credere eum de me
I don't know whether he saw it.	Nescio an vidit.
As you said.	Sicut dixisti.
I could not do it at the same time.	Simul illud non potui.

I see you alone	Video te solum ut
It is done.	Factum est.
I just wanted to be gone	Ego iustus voluit ad abiit

This is not an easy task	Hoc non est facile opus
It is not so.	Non ita est.
Go and talk to her	Ire et loqui ad eam
So he was there.	Sic ibi fuit.
He said to him many things.	Dixit ei multa.
Day to day.	Die ad diem suum.
That there was something here.	Quod non erat hic aliquid.
But that little help.	Sed id parum auxilium.
He told me this only.	Dixit mihi hoc tantum.
This is the first time I have ever met.	Hoc est primum semper occurrit.
I really hope you want it	Ego vere spero te ut volo

I'm sure he wants to talk to you	Certus sum enim te velle loqui tibi
I have nothing to say	Nihil habeo dicere
I can just do it e	Non possum iustus facere eum e

Your real name.	Tuum verum nomen.
I know for sure	Scio certe

I didn't know her in that	Et ego nesciebam eam in illa
I would do .	facerem .
That's my first, after all.	Illud mihi primum, post omnes.
I can't believe everything you said	Omnia possum credere quae dixisti
But that's for sure.	Sed id certe.
You know.	Scis.
And probably right.	Et verisimiliter recte.
I wanted to stop saying it	Dicere volui eam prohibere
They don't like us.	Non sicut nos.
I was his.	eius fui.
You can hear me.	Potes me audire.
He would not.	Noluit.
with what and how.	Cum quid et quomodo.
He likes to play by me.	Per me ludere vult.
The man was about thirty.	Vir erat triginta fere.
He didn't want to think.	Noluit cogitare.
I tried not to think what was there.	Conatus sum non cogitare quid ibi esset.
I don't really know what to do this morning	Non vere scio quid hoc facere mane
This is not enough.	Hoc parum est.
But now it has been said out.	Nunc sed dictum ex.
I want to see it tomorrow	Volo videre eam cras
It's time to get away from the game.	Aliquam a velit est.
I find it hard to believe	Ego invenire difficile credere
I wanted something more	Volui aliquid plus
Not the same.	Non ipsum.
I still like to do my best	Ego tamen ut faciam meum
All in itself.	Totum in se.
We have no future.	Non habemus futurum'.
I can't go anywhere.	Huc ire non possum.
Just a little more time, a little more time	Modo plus temporis, paulo plus temporis
I can't speak for me	Non possum dicere pro me
I will fight for my quid	Ego pro quid mea

I have not done it for you.	Non feci tibi.
Talk to someone.	Loqui cum aliquo.
I want to see it for me	Volo videre eam ad me

but yet he was unwilling to believe this.	sed tamen hoc credere noluit.
I don't know how to act	Nescio quomodo agere
But the first thing I need is	Verum primum opus est
Not yet with him	Non tamen cum eo
I thought that would be enough	Putavi fore satis
I am more than you	Ego plus quam tu

I wanted to do one thing.	unum facere volui.
I don't even know what happened with her	Nescio quidem quid cum illa factum est
But also.	Sed et.
I think you can stay here	Puto manere hic potest
I think you probably won't be the only one.	Probabile non solum unum puto.

Your only name is.	Tibi solum nomen est.
It's time for a story.	Aliquam a tempus est.

Well, almost everything.	Bene, omnia fere.
How could I even do this?	Potui etiam quomodo facere
I completely forgot that	Ego omnino oblitus es quod
It is important for you.	Aliquam sit amet enim est.
I'm not really sure enough	Non sum satis certus vere
You know where to look.	Scis ubi vide.
NEW	NOVI.
I don't want to see it.	Nolo ad eam.
It's not the same as that.	Etiam non ipsum quam.
I haven't told anyone it	Non indicavit quis est
Busy one in this video.	Occupatus unus hoc video.
That would be for nothing.	Id esse pro nihil.
I wonder if he saw something that he did	Miror si vidit aliquid quod ei fecit
Stay at home if you want.	Mane domi si vis.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
We will work on this one.	Opus nobis erit in hac una.
The whole plan has been made.	Consilium est totum factum.
I hope you all get there	Spero vos omnes illuc
I know what it was	Scio quid esset
I was told that it is not	Dictum est mihi quod non
We all really like it.	Omnes vere placet.
But, he will, he will.	Sed, velit, velit.
He wanted this evil.	Voluit hoc malum.
I don't want to see you here	Non vis videre vos hic
That was good too.	Bonum erat id etiam.
I can't live without you	Non possum vivere nec sine te
He could do whatever he wanted.	Potuit facere quod voluit.
To do so now.	Ut id nunc.
It was very good.	Erat valde bona.
she said.	illa dixit.
I've never seen her like this before.	Numquam eius ut id ante.
I can do this for you	Hoc facere possum tibi
We have nothing per se.	Per se nihil habemus.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
I said all of it	Dixi omnes ex eo
Talk to her.	Ad eam loqui.
No it's always the same.	Nulla id semper ipsum.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Paenitet me audire.
I know for sure your	Ego certe scio tuum
Perhaps you know what this is.	Scis fortasse quid hoc sit.
Get this one	Ut hoc unum
I wonder what it will be	Miror quod erit
I am so very sorry.	Ita sum valde.
So now he's gone.	Sic nunc abiit.
I wanted to say yes.	Etiam dicere volui.
I don't like it but	Non placet, sed
You think you're doing well.	Bene te facere putas.
and you have.	et habes.
I see you have someone at your home	Video te habere aliquem ad te in domum suam
Tell me how you are.	Dic quomodo sis.
As required, it was still too much.	Quod erat faciendum, adhuc nimium erat.
I wonder what this is.	Miror quid hoc sit.
Which was done so quickly.	Quod tam cito factum est.
I can't believe you	Non possum credere te
He does well.	Bene facit.
Not after, but before.	Non post, sed ante.
I told him about mine	De mea dixi ei
And not very much.	Nec valde.
I need to stop doing that	Mihi opus est prohibere facere quod
Now I can see more	Nunc videre possum amplius
I don't want to know more	Non vis scire plus
This one is much better.	Hoc unum est multo melius.
I told you.	Dixi vobis.
It's too soon.	Est etiam cito.
I don't know who's here	Nescio quis hic
I didn't know where I was	Nesciebam ubi esset
I will do it all better	Bonum faciam illud
And it's true that you can.	Et verum est quod potes.
I can't believe all this	Non possum credere omnia haec
He will not.	Non vult.
I think this one could win.	Hoc unum vincere posse puto.
You know you've done it.	Scis te fecisse.
You know it can be done.	Scis fieri posse.
These things are good.	Haec bona sunt.
I won't be that bad	Ego autem non sit quod malum
What is this.	Quid hoc est.
I don't know what is this	Nescio quid hoc
rightly, he thought.	recte, putavit.
I just tried to do good work	Ego iustus conatus ad bonum opus
He loves money.	Pecuniam amat.
There was none in none.	Nulla in nulla erat.
That was true.	Quod erat verum.
I told you that in the afternoon	Dixi vobis, ut post meridiem
Nothing to it.	Nihil ad eam.
We need to know something else.	Scire, aliud opus est.
But it was only said.	Sed non dictum nisi.
But he could not prevent it.	Sed nec prohibere non potuit.
I think not much	Puto non multum
I didn't know this.	Hoc ego nesciebam.
It is the game.	Est velit.
I hope no one is behind me	Spero autem post me nemo
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
I'm glad to say both but here someone else	Gaudeo utrumque sed hic aliquis dicere
But it was not enough.	Sed parum fuit.
They are not at all.	Non sunt omnino.
This won't be easy.	Hoc non erit facile.
Would definitely stay here again.	Certe hic iterum manere.
You have to do it.	Facere tibi est id.
I did not.	Non feci.
I just was sure	Ego iustus certus eram
But not now.	Sed ne iam.
I didn't want you to think badly of me	Nolui te de me male cogitare
I know what you did to you	Scio quid fecerit tibi
He seems to understand, but says not much.	Intelligere videtur, sed non multum dicit.
Look for you.	Vide tibi.
I hope all is well with you	Spero bene tibi
I still do my best	Ego tamen facio meum
I knew what it was	Sciebam quid esset
He ought not to do this.	Hoc facere non debet.
Do.	Facere.
Something more for me.	Plus aliquid me.
Now I'll do it.	Nunc faciam.
I saw her this morning	Vidi eam hanc mane
So he does it all.	Ita facit omnes.
I could see the future	Non potui videre futurum
I couldn't save it now	Non potui nisi eam nunc
But this was not to be done.	Sed hoc non erat faciendum.
But see to yourself.	Sed vide tibi.
I don't talk with him at all	Non loqui cum eo omnino
This work was unsuccessful.	Hoc opus potuit.
I am very happy to say yes	Ego valde felix dixit quod sic
i'm really sorry about that	Sum vere paenitet quod
It could not be, but it is.	Fieri non potuit, sed est.
This is really good.	Hic vere bonus est.
I know someone who still	Novi aliquem, qui tamen
and so it is.	et sic est.
I believe there for a long time	Credo ibi diu
There is still a lot of work to do.	Multum adhuc opus est.
He doesn't love me.	Me quidem non amat.
Which one is	Quod unum est.
How can it be done.	Quomodo fieri potest.
I didn't want to come with me	Nolui venire mecum
Why are we	Cur sumus .
I want her to come home.	Volo eam domum venire.
I can see you in your room	Non possum te in cubiculum tuum
I thought I was doing so well	Putavi eram facere ut bene
Now you don't have to make a decision.	Nunc consilium facere non habes.
I feel and feel it.	Sentio et sentio.
I am not going to do it	Non facturus est
I wish this was with me now	Volo hic erat mecum nunc
But nothing is like it.	Sed nihil simile est.
I couldn't think of what it was	Non potui cogitare quid esset
I haven't seen anything for you.	Ego nihil tibi non vidi.
I knew not always before	Sciebam non semper ante
No, both.	Non, utrumque.
But that was said.	Sed id erat dictum.
You can see my post here.	Post me hic videre potes.
I really don't wonder at all	Ego vere omnino non miror
I never wanted to leave	Numquam volui eum relinquere
One met me.	Una mihi occurrit.
I don't know what's wrong with her	Nescio quid mali eius
I have a question for you.	Habeo tibi quaestionem.
I knew she'd understand	Sciebam se intelligere velis
Not so great.	Non ita magna.
I don't think it's likely.	Non puto verisimile.
It's nothing.	Nihil suus.
No one could speak for a long time.	Diu nemo loqui potuit.
i am too good at this work	Ego quoque in hoc opus bonum
But it is not enough.	Sed non satis est.
I think you talk to me Father	Puto te loqui ad me Pater
I was right, you know	Recte fui, tu scis
I need to work	Mihi opus est ad opus
Which is the case here.	Quod ad rem ita se habet.
Tomorrow I will do it again.	Cras iterum faciam.
I am so sure.	Tam certus sum.
I can barely go	Ire vix possum
I wonder how you did it	Miror quomodo fecit illud
This is not the case anymore.	Hoc amplius non est.
I don't even know you are here	Non quidem scio hic es
You're going to be able to.	Facturus es posse.
I know it's still very much	Scio tamen est valde
Not much to go	Ire non multo
I can't think of all this right now	Hoc nunc non possum cogitare de omnibus
Everything we just need.	Omnia ut iustus opus.
I just didn't want it too	Ego iustus noluit eum nimis
I don't believe you are one	Non credo esse unum
But it seemed something.	Sed videbatur aliquid.
I have something to do	Habeo aliquid facere
I left it	Ego reliquit eam
I really know that	Ego vere scio quod
I never wanted	Volui numquam
No, but soon.	Non, sed mox.
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
At last you shouldn't be able to think.	Tandem non debes cogitare posse.
Look at this.	De hoc vide.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I guess probably not all.	Suspicor omnes probabiliter.
Yes, that was great.	Etiam id magna erat.
I want to talk to you.	Volo tecum loqui.
I have a job to do and do	Habeo officium facere et facere
I want to be happy again	Volo ut felix iterum
But at last there	Sed ibi tandem.
But that's how it is.	Sed id ipsum quam.
if you want to.	si vis.
See who said all things that he thought both	Vide qui dixit omnia se utrumque cogitare
And this morning	Et hoc mane.
I know for sure you will do just fine.	Pro certo scio te solum bene facturum.
Never even find	Numquam etiam invenire
I hope you understand	Spero te intelligere
he said that he was not.	dixit se non esse.
This could not have been done.	Id fieri non potuit.
another said.	aliud dixit.
It's probably the man.	Vir suus probabiliter.
I have plenty of time.	Habeo multa temporis.
I could still do nothing	Potui etiam nihil
We don't talk about that.	Nos non loqui de illo.
yes or no.	Etiam vel nulla erat.
I was alone at that time	Solus eram illo tempore
Something else is coming.	Aliquid aliud venit.
You can't understand yourself.	Non potes intelligere te.
I need to get it done first	Opus est ut factum est primum
To mean something.	Ut sit aliquid.
This thing he did.	Haec res fecit.
Maybe it's too late.	Sero fortasse.
I could not do without you	Non potui sine te
You know yourself.	Scis te ipsum.
I know I made friends too.	Novi etiam amicos feci.
I think it looks better that way	Puto melius illuc spectat
A lot of money.	Multum pecuniae.
I think that's it right now.	Id nunc puto.
And there he is.	Et ibi est.
That's true, right now.	Ut vere, nunc.
I didn't know him	Ego nesciebam eum
I doubt most of the time with her	Dubito plus temporis cum illa
I think you'd better come with me now	Puto velis melius venire mecum nunc
I don't know what else to say to you	Nescio quid aliud tibi dicere
You know, man.	Scis, homo.
She must be at home now.	Domi iam esse debet.
You can't stop.	Non potes prohibere.
There was nothing he could do better.	Nihil erat quod hoc melius faceret.
that I may even make my name.	ut etiam nomen meum faciam.
I need to make it busy again	Mihi opus est ad eam occupatus iterum
He knew that he could give.	Sciebat se dare posse.
I couldn't do anything	Non potui cur aliquid
I heard you first	Audivi te primum
To be .	Ut esset .
I love her and give her something	Ego amo eam et aliquid ei dare
It was never enough for me.	Mihi satis numquam fuit.
I didn't see this coming at all	Hoc venire omnino non videre
I think that's what I need	Puto quod opus est
I won't be until late	Et non erit usque ad sero
You should see him.	Eum videre debes.
He did not say anything.	Dicere non habuit.
He told me to talk to you.	Et dixit ad me ut tibi dicere.
We're up to your job.	Ad officium tuum sumus.
He could not do this.	Hoc facere potuit.
What he said he does.	Quod dixit facit.
It was time to leave.	Tempus erat relinquere.
I could not do this	Hoc facere non potui
Today is the day to give.	Hodie est dies dare.
You are nothing to me.	Nihil mihi es.
All things are still good.	Adhuc omnia bona sunt.
I'm never really sick	Ego numquam vere male
I couldn't say anything wrong	Non potui dicere aliquid mali
that is, no one knows.	id est Nemo scit.
I told you everything	Dixi vobis omnia
I thought I was.	Putabam me esse.
It is much better.	Multo melius est.
He knew what this meant.	Sciebat quid hoc esset.
you'd be late.	Sero velis.
I couldn't believe what happened	Non potui credere quod factum est
I'm sure money matters.	Certus sum res pecuniae.
I did that to you	Feci quod tibi
I have said a lot	Multum me dixisse
yes i can't find it.	Etiam invenire non possum.
I knew you were going to be	Sciebam te facturum esse
I want more.	Volo plus.
I didn't want to say	Non volui dicere
I think if someone would do it for me.	Puto si aliquis, id me facturum.
My father refused.	Pater meus noluit.
it was almost	erat fere.
I knew you were saying	Sciebam te dicere
She could hear.	Posset audire.
But that was none.	Sed id erat nulla.
And do it again.	Et iterum fac.
I don't know exactly what this means	Nescio quid hoc modo prorsus
I can't believe nobody thought of it before	Non possum credere nemo cogitavi ante

I'm not sure what to do with it	Non certus sum quid faciam cum illo
I knew what this meant	Sciebam quid hoc esset
I could buy something	Non potui quid emere
I'm here.	Sum hic.
I can hardly believe it	Vix possum credere illud
I can't do it.	Id facere non possum.
No one has.	Nemo habet.
I don't even want to go	Non quidem vis ire
me to do more	Me plus facere

But this is it.	Sed hoc est.
I just want to hear it	Ego iustus volo audire eam
No one was ready.	Nulla in paratus erat.
She is gone.	Abiit illa.
I want to see that again	Volo videre quod iterum

I'll never get to him again	Numquam ego ad eum iterum
I can't do anything about it.	Non possum aliquid de illo.

In U.S .	In nobis .
I didn't know what to do	Ego nesciebam quid hoc facere
To me for sure.	Ad me certe.
I don't need anything from him	Non opus est aliquid ab eo

Me this time	Mihi hoc tempore

I don't think through very well	Non puto per optime

I wanted to sit	Volui ut ille sit
Nor was this evil.	Nec hoc malum fuit.
It was really very good.	Vere erat valde bona.

That's not us.	Ut non est nobis.
I know where school is	Scio ubi schola est
I had one day for sure	Habui unum diem certe

I don't think that's what you mean.	Non puto id quod vis.

I haven't seen it.	Non vidi eam.
I told him I wouldn't, but he did	Nolo ei dixi, sed fecit

I see something.	aliquid video.
I hope all is home pretty well	Spero omnes domi satis bene

I can't think of that	Non possum cogitare de illo
I didn't know what you'd like to do	Ego nesciebam quod velis agere
It is good for him.	Bonum est ei.
I don't care what it is.	Nolo quid sit.
Why didn't you take it before	Cur non ante te accipere
I guess you shouldn't be there	Suspicor ne ibi sit

I have nothing to say	Nihil habeo dicere
It could only come in its own time.	Posset nisi suo tempore venire.
I could hear something behind us	Audire potui aliquid post nos
Not much but nothing was better.	Non multum sed nihil melius erat.
I didn't want it	Non volui eam
I never saw anything like	Numquam vidi aliquid simile
That was how it was.	Ut id erat erat.
I don't need anyone	Non opus quis
I am alone.	Solus sum ego.
I couldn't believe it too	Non potui credere ei quoque
And he told him all things.	Et dixit ei omnia.
There was none.	Nulla erat.
And after his money.	Et post pecuniam suam.
Say something together.	Dic ut aliquid simul.
there I heard you.	ibi te audivi.
There was one time when this could be done.	Unum erat tempus, cum id fieri posset.
I knew what he meant.	Sciebam quid vellet.
and he knows.	et scit.
I'm still here for you	Ego etiam hic pro te
That's before.	Id ante.
I knew he was doing	Sciebam se facere
never get the money	Numquam pecuniam
Don't do it.	Noli facere.
A lot of time here	Multum temporis hic
I want to have this name.	Hoc nomen volo habere.
I think you're like that	Puto te esse simile quod
You don't really win.	Vincere vere non est.
I know I can hear you.	Scio te audire posse.
But it is not the same.	Sed non est ipsum.
Yes I want to do	Ita volo facere
I used him before	Eram se ante
He wanted this even more.	Hoc etiam plus vellet.
I wanted time to think	Volui tempus cogitare
You can talk to him.	Ipsum ipsum loqui potes.
I thought of you	Cogitavi tu
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
That	Quod.
I could not do it for you	Non potui vobis facere
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
I need to stay tomorrow	Opus est ut mane cras
Maybe even too much.	Aliquam vel nimis.
and he wished to remain at night.	et nocte manere voluit.
I want to stay here again	Iterum volo manere hic
I knew each other about me	Sciebam se de me
The design was the same for all.	Omnibus idem consilium fuit.
I've seen you for years.	Annos vidi te.
I guess you're also very convincing	Suspicor te etiam valde persuadere
I wanted to do good work	Volui facere bonum opus
I never wanted.	Numquam volui.
We can go wherever you want.	Possumus ire quo vis.
I knew to do	Sciebam hoc facere
He did, however.	Fecit tamen.
Good trip to you.	Bonum iter ad te.
I never saw the need to speak	Numquam vidi necesse est loqui
This boy is.	Hic puer est.
Yes, yes.	Ita, sic.
I tried to help.	Conatus est auxilium.
I need to get everything in	Mihi opus est ut omnia in
Yes that is how.	Etiam id est quam.
But in all things I could see	Verum in omnibus videre potui
I wonder if you can help me	Miror si me adiuvet
I was in the morning	Eram mane
I don't have money	Non habeo pecuniam
Not that morning.	Non quod mane.
I need to work	Mihi opus est ad opus
But things went well.	Sed res ad bene.
Can anyone help me.	Potest quis me adiuvet.
And he could not.	Et non potuit.
I could do that	Facere potui, quod
I want you to come to me	Volo te ad me venire
I'm ready	Paratus sum
You'll never see me again.	Numquam me iterum.
I know he won't stay there	Scio eum non manere ibi
Back to what's there.	Quid ibi Ad.
What has already been said.	Quod iam dictum est.
I don't know whether it is true or not	Ego non scio an verum sit vel non
Not with you.	Non apud te.
It is certain.	Certum est.
I still have little to see	Ego tamen non parum videre
I knew what was going to happen	Sciebam quod futurum erat
Yes it is difficult.	Ita est difficile.
I hope you can see well enough.	Spero te satis bene videre potes.
Maybe it wasn't but it was.	Aliquam non nisi erat.
This period was about one week.	Hoc tempus fere una septimana erat.
He says he didn't do it.	Dicit se non facere.
He is now here.	Hic nunc est.
which I could not do.	quod facere non potui.
Never leave home	Numquam relinquere domum suam
But there was only a.	Sed a erat nisi.
I just didn't know how long it would be	Ego iustus nesciebam quam diu esset
He could never say no.	Dicere non potuit numquam.
I'm just thinking about you	Ego iustus cogitas te
This dog is so good.	Hic canis tam bonus est.
Everything to plan	Omnia ad consilium
Can help me if please.	Adiuvare me possit si velit.
No you are not yourself.	Nulla non ipsum quam.
There is more than one.	Plus est unum.
What does this mean?	Quid hoc sibi vult.
Something is better than nothing.	Aliquid melius quam nihil.
I hope you get that	Spero te ut quod
He does not do him well.	Non eum bene facit.
I tried not to know what	Conatus sum ne quid de
I want good and bad.	Volo bonum et malum.
But we do the thing.	Sed nos rem.
I believe this myself.	Hoc ego ipse credo.
I'll get you if you want	Faciam ut tibi, si vis
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
I feel a little better	Sentio paulo melius
Now something!.	Nunc aliquid!.
There's always a save.	Nulla a semper nisi.
He made.	Fecit.
It is not likely.	Verisimile non est.
All in all.	Omnino est.
I wanted to be a father to you	Pater esse volui tibi
I don't know where to go or who to believe	Nescio quo ire vel quis credere
Exactly so now.	Ita prorsus nunc est.
He did not know what he was doing.	Quod cum esset, nesciebat.
No one knows him.	Nemo eum novit.
There was nothing at all	Nihil omnino fuit
I knew this would not be easy.	Id non facile sciebam.
We can talk there.	Ibi loqui possumus.
Yes no please.	Etiam nulla velit.
I don't like her face	Et non sicut vultus eius
I'm here to get you home	Ego hic ad te in domum suam
And apparently I am not doing it wrong.	Et videtur non male facere.
A lot better	A multo melius fuit
It was what it was, what it did.	Erat, quae fuit, quod fecit.
She thought he thought it was done.	Putavit putabat se factum esse.
Maybe something else.	Forsitan aliud.
I can't think	Non possum cogitare
And this is the man.	Hic autem est homo.
I hardly even know it	Vix quidem scio eam
Maybe they all thought the same thing.	Forsitan omnes idem putavit.
I can't say for sure	Pro certo habeo eam non dixisse
I think it would be like that	Puto fore ut illa
Nothing for him.	Nihil ei.
I probably don't like it	Ego probabiliter non placet
It's a little more than that.	Est paulo plus quam illud.
I could not do this without him	Hoc facere non potui sine eius
It's not as bad as it looks.	Non tam malum est quam spectat.
It's already in you.	Iam in te est.
I can't believe anyone	Non possum credere quis
I want to know how this was done	Scire volo quomodo hoc factum est
But it is possible.	Sed fieri potest.
He did not know.	Nesciebat.
I can still hear you.	Adhuc te audire possum.
I will speak in this way.	Dicam hoc modo.
I can't know please	Non possum scire placet
I have something to say	Habeo aliquid dicere
Where the man is.	Ubi homo est.
You also .	Tu quoque .
never asked again.	numquam iterum quaesivit.
Never think of you	Nunquam puto te
How much work is required.	Quantum opus sit.
The father does not have.	Pater non habet.
But this is not enough.	Sed hoc parum est.
I used to be with you	Eram ut sit tibi cum
I really do nothing right now	Ego vere nihil iam
If you could be here with you, you know.	Si posset hic tecum esse, tu scis.
I don't need you again, don't do anything	Non opus est tibi iterum, non aliquid
I can, you know.	Non possum, tu scis.
I didn't know what was wrong to say	Ego nesciebam quid esset malum ei dicere
I don't need to listen.	Non opus est audire.
Not so here.	Non ita hic.
But we can do better.	Sed melius facere possumus.
I never got that before	Numquam obtinuit ut ante
I've never been home before	Ego numquam domum ante
If you really don't want to.	Si vere non vis.
I was told	Dictum est mihi
I know bad things this season	Scio malum hoc tempore
I told him I didn't need it.	Dixi ei non opus esse.
And tonight it was .	Et hac nocte fuit .
This I think will do what you want	Hoc puto facturum quod vis
I heard nothing could stop him.	Nihil audivi eum posse prohibere.
I need to get to me	Mihi opus est ut ad me
No one knows your name either.	Nemo nomen tuum vel novit.
But not all of this.	Sed non omnes hoc.
I'm not ready	Non sum paratus
It is not likely.	Verisimile non est.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
I could do anything but it	Non potui facere quicquam nisi eam
I knew how to act	Sciebam agere
Maybe there was somebody.	Aliquam erat quis.
To appreciate right now.	Ut bene nunc.
That would be something he wanted.	Esset id aliquid quod velit.
But it is well.	Sed bene est.
The boy was fine.	Puer, bene erat.
This never really happened.	Hoc numquam vere factum est.
But see in this way.	Sed vide hoc modo.
I can't tell you at all	Non possum tibi omnino dicere
I knew that it was true.	verum esse sciebam.
I can hardly believe we all live	Vix credere possum omnes nos vivere
I know where.	Scio in.
I like everything about you	Mihi placet omnia de te
Now not enough.	Iam non satis.
Something related to something.	Res ad aliquid.
I didn't forget what I did	Oblitus non sum quid fecit
All this through.	Haec omnia per.
And not there.	Et non ibi.
It's going to be okay.	Bene futurum est.
I already like her a lot	Ego iam similis eius multum
He did all things.	Omnia fecit.
I never thought I would be so long	Numquam putabam me tam diu fore
I wonder how it works	Miror quomodo agit
Everything looks pretty.	Omnia satis spectat.
I know you don't know why.	Scio te non cur.
I can't get enough of you	Non possum satis vis
I need to get out of it	Mihi opus est ut de eius
But it can be the same.	Sed potest idem esse.
I thought you wanted to do it yourself.	Putabam te velle id ipsum facere.
He would not see any more.	Noluit amplius videre.
I couldn't get him into it	Non potui accipere eum in eo
It was pretty certain.	Satis certum fuit.
You can't think much.	Non potes cogitare quantum.
I wanted you to know	Volui te scire
But who you are and what you do.	Sed quis es et quid facias.
He is a boy.	Puer est.
I know that you're coming to me	Scio quod es venire ad me
and evil.	et malum.
I don't know where, but it was close	Nescio ubi, sed proxima erat
I know you know something	Scio te scire aliquid
I never wanted to do that	Ego numquam volui facere quae
I thought it was like	Cogitavi sicut erat
But this is even better.	Sed hoc etiam melius.
I am doing this to you	Ego sum facis hoc tibi
It's too easy.	Nimis facile est.
I thought I would be here	Putavi hic fore
But that's how it is.	Sed id ipsum quam.
I can't do it for sure	Non possum certe facere
To have someone.	Habere aliquem.
But I know for sure that there is one thing.	Sed unum esse certo scio.
I really feel for him	Ego vere sentio pro eo
We like to buy things.	Res emere nobis placet.
I wasn't that kind of guy	Non eram id genus guy
So I tried to find it.	Ita conatus sum invenire eam.
I didn't want to find myself.	Nolui invenire me.
Nothing is.	Nihil est.
I really need someone to talk to at the time	Ego vere opus aliquis loqui eo tempore
But I could not	Ego autem non potui
Never be here for long.	Numquam hic in tempore.
It is enough to say.	Satis est dicere.
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
So perhaps you are.	Ita fortasse es.
You tried to get an	Conatus ad an.
I want to see her.	Volo eam videre.
This was the one who got this job for me.	Hoc officium hic mihi fuit qui obtinuit.
But the time was now.	Sed tempus erat nunc.
This is not good.	Hoc non est bonum.
I can't say the future	Non possum dicere futurum
I could not leave him	Eum relinquere non potui
I feel that I will be	Sentio quod erit
That's what happened.	Id quod factum est.
This is not	Non hoc est
That won't be hard.	Quod non erit difficile.
I would always	Utinam semper
Do not speak thus.	Noli sic loqui.
I also agree with him	Ego quoque cum eo
I want it more than anything	Volo eam plus quam aliquid
He does not say.	Non dicit.
Look, yes.	Vide, etiam.
This has never been done like this.	Hoc numquam sic factum est.
Too good to be true.	Nimis bonus est verum.
I can't say the same	Non possum dicere idem
I just need to	Ego iustus opus ad
Stay here with me.	Mane hic mecum.
I don't doubt if I get sick now	Non dubito si male nunc non
I was just one person.	Unus homo eram iustus.
That was it.	Erat id.
I really don't think he would do it	Ego vere non puto se facturum esse
She knows that she is a dog.	Scit se canem esse.
I can't tell anyone.	Non possum dicere quis.
And he was here.	Hic et erat.
And it was well.	Et bene fuit.
I'm sure he did.	Me certe fecit.
I just want to talk to you	Ego iustus volo loqui ad vos
He could not do the thing.	Non potuit rem facere.
I can't leave everything like this	Non possum sic relinquere omnia sic sunt
I want to make friends	Volo facere ut amicos
Hard to tell you	Dicam tibi difficile
I have done it.	Feci.
I wanted to be just happy	Volui esse sicut felix
Not me, but.	Non me, sed.
may or may not be similar	Ut vel non fieri simile
I appreciate it	Ego valde eam
You can't be done.	Non potes fieri.
I didn't know anything about you	Ego nesciebam quod de te
I don't think too much	Non puto nimium
But I don't understand much.	Sed non multum intelligere.
I want something that matters	Volo aliquid, quod res
It should be it.	Debet esse eam.
I just want to get away from it.	EGO iustus volo ut ab illa.
I don't see what	Non video quid
I don't really mean that	Non vere vult quod
I knew that he didn't know	Sciebam se nescire
He did not think correctly.	Non recte putabat.
This is truly to see.	Hoc est, vere videre.
I don't mean it.	Non vult eam.
I do not believe this to be true.	Non credo hoc verum esse.
I can't deal with it	Non possum agere cum illo
I hope not.	Spero non.
I haven't forgotten	Non sum oblitus es
Who do you think	Quis putas.
I just want to be with me	Ego iustus volo ut sit apud me
But this is what He willed.	Sed hoc est quod voluit.
Not well.	Non bene.
I don't need to know	Non debeo scire
I told you before me	Dixi vos ante me
I can do it	Me posse facere
But this is not easy to say.	Sed hoc non est facile dicere.
I can't do it tomorrow	Cras id facere non possum
That's it from everyone.	Quod eam ab omnibus.
You can speak well.	Bene potes dicere.
Thus he did.	Sic fecit.
since it is so necessary.	cum ita sit necesse est.
I think he is right now.	Puto eum nunc esse.
It has not been said.	Non dictum est.
Maybe you're sorry.	Fortasse paenitet.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
And it's not good	Et non est bonum
For there was only one thing I needed to know.	Erat enim tantum unum scire opus.
I don't want to do any of it	Non vis ut faciam aliquo ex eo
sorry for what i'm	Paenitet me quod sum
I don't want you.	Nolo te.
i thought it wasn't either.	Putabam vel non.
I have a future before me	Ego habeo futurum ante me
I have not	habeo nec habeo
It is the same.	Idem est.
I can hardly see you anymore	Vix video te amplius
I love my dad so much	Pater meus tantum amo
he could not do it.	facere potuit.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
Yes, it's good for me.	Etiam, bonum mihi est.
There is another need.	Aliud opus est.
I hope we find a home to stay	Spero nos invenire domum manere
I am very glad you are all here tonight	Sum valde gaudeo vos omnes hic sunt in hac nocte
Its not gonna be but this time.	Eius non amet sed id tempus.
And perhaps	Et fortasse.
I wonder where he went	Miror ubi abiit
I know you want us to leave	Scio te velle nos relinquere
He is a boy.	Puer est.
Well, it really is.	Bene, ita vere est.
And certainly not men.	Et certe non homines.
Now I know what it is?	Nunc scio quid sit?
He could not do this now.	Hoc nunc agere non potuit.
Now I can see.	Nunc videre possum.
I tried, but I could not	Conatus sum, sed non potui
I feel good about this.	De hoc bene sentio.
It probably was.	Probabile fuit.
Maybe that was the whole plan.	Forsitan id totum consilium fuit.
I think you'd like to hear better	Puto te melius audire velis
I want to see one	Volo videre unum
Maybe even better.	Fortasse melius etiam.
don't talk to him	Non loqui ei
Completely done on my own	Omnino feci in mea
Maybe he did it.	Fortasse fecit.
I know you want to have him	Scio te velle habere eum
I think it will be this week.	Puto eum hac septimana fore.
Hardly by one	Vix per unum
It will be.	Erit.
I knew three to be different	Sciebam tres esse aliud
I was good, but not quite well.	Bonum essem, sed non satis bene.
Time before time	Tempus ante tempus.
You're probably still making the same decision today.	Probabile es adhuc hoc idem consilium hodie facere.
But there is one thing.	Sed unum est.
I am him for me	Ego illum ad me
I want to be something	Volo esse aliquid
I want to see it	Volo eam videre
I just can't help it	Ego iustus non adiuvet eam
They are good at the same time.	Simul bona sunt.
I feel more than anything	Sentio plus quam aliquid
i think she just thought it was time	Puto eam iustus putavit esse tempus
Now who was out.	Nunc quis ex erat.
All I can see	Omnia possum videre
To not save.	Ut non nisi.
I will never speak to you, never.	Nunquam tibi dicam, nunquam.
I think you need to give it	Puto quod debes dare eam
I told you	Dixi vobis
Why not? 	Cur non?
I think the same can be done now	Idem nunc fieri posse puto
I wanted to help	Volui auxilium
i think that's what you said	Puto hoc est quod dixisti
We can't do it anymore.	Non possumus facere amplius.
This is exactly what I need.	Ita prorsus opus est.
He said what he just wanted	Dixit quod hoc modo voluit
Make me one	Facere me unum
I hope you are not alone here	Spero autem non solum huc
I don't want you	Ego tibi non vis
He doesn't want it to be	Non vult enim fieri
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
I really love you	Ego vere amo
But yet it is difficult to leave here.	Sed tamen hic relinquere difficile est.
But so that.	Sed ut.
I could tell by the look of him	Non potui dicere a vultus eius
I want to use it	Volo ut eam
You don't want, but you want.	Non vis, sed vis.
Which is much better.	Quod multo melius est.
I know this will be	Scio hic erit
He started it up.	Incepit eam.
I need to buy time	Mihi opus est emere tempore
But better than good.	Sed melius quam bene.
I know, she thought.	Scio, putavit.
I thought I was doing my best	Putavi meum facere
It was too much before his time.	Nimis erat ante tempus suum.
I could not do this alone	Hoc solum non potui
Nothing is better.	Nihil est melius.
It's still great.	Est adhuc magna.
But how.	Sed quomodo.
I didn't do what he came to do.	Non facere quod venit facere.
I hope you spend a lot of time	Spero multum temporis
I know what you mean.	Scio quid sit tibi.
By us	Per nos.
That he never did.	Quod nunquam fecerit.
through I think.	per puto.
I had too many things.	Nimis multa habui.
I've been with you for sure	Fui cum certum
And it is very unlikely.	Et valde probabile est.
So see what you have.	Sic vide quid habes.
I don't know what's happened till today	Nescio quid acciderit, usque hodie
Not like the day	Non, sicut dies.
I thought well	Cogitavi bene
I had to do this work	Ego quoque ad hoc opus
i never did it.	numquam id feci.
I knew nothing really about him yet.	nihil adhuc de eo vere sciebam.
I just don't like him	Ego iustus non similis ei
I don't know where he is	Nescio ubi est
I don't want to be with her	Non vis esse apud eam
But he could not.	Sed non potuit.
Look soon.	Vide mox.
I was sure more	Certus eram plus
There was something in me.	In me erat aliquid.
But it was not that.	Sed non erat id.
I couldn't anymore	Non potui amplius
I have so much more help	Habeo auxilium multo amplius
I have seen too	Vidi etiam
There was nothing else here.	Fuit hic aliud.
And I am very surprised by this	Ego autem hoc valde miror
But I can't see.	Sed videre non possum.
He wanted to know, and he asked much.	Scire voluit et multum quaesivit.
I hope you don't want to.	Spero te non velle.
I knew I didn't want to.	Noluisse sciebam.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
I know you a little	Scio te parum
That's great.	Ut id magna.
No, not enough.	Non, parum.
It is certain!.	Certum est!.
But also.	Sed et.
I love you that much	Te amo quod multum
Here before.	Hic ante.
It's not the same at all.	Aliquam non ipsum nulla.
I can't see that in you	Non possum videre quod in te
I didn't want to hear me	Nolui audire me
The situation is correct.	Ita se res habet, recte.
I didn't know about it	Ego nesciebam de eo
You didn't make it	Non fecisti eam
I do more than now	Facio plus quam nunc
To be honest.	Ut sit amet est.
I hope to be	Spero fore ut
I don't think I believe.	Non puto me credere.
I choose first	Libet primum
I told him that it was e	Dixi ei quod esset e
I can't believe they do that	Non possum credere se facere quod
No that's the same now.	Nulla id nunc ipsum.
I can see enough.	satis videre possum.
That's when he saw it.	Id cum vidit.
You still do it.	Adhuc id facere.
I could not have said better to me	Non potui melius dixisse me
I knew to see it too	Sciebam etiam eam videre
I need your help	Mihi opus auxilium tuum
No, you can't.	Non, non potes.
I wonder why she loves me	Miror quod me amat
I don't want to hear anything from him	Non vis audire aliquid ab eo
I know you there	Scio te ibi
he understood his duty.	officium suum intellexit.
I can do it now too	Non possum facere, nunc quoque
Unless you do.	Nisi feceris.
What happened, I couldn't stop	Quod factum est, non potui prohibere
More than you're ready.	Plus quam paratus es.
Certainly not.	Non certe.
I think perhaps badly	Ego cogitare fortasse male
Not if you really like.	Non si vere similis.
I can't say anything else	Ego non possum dicere aliquid aliud
I can't make a decision now	Non possum facere consilium nunc
He can speak.	Loqui potest.
I'm working tonight	Ego hac nocte opus est
It will be better now for sure.	Melius nunc certe erit.
Unless that's one thing for me.	Nisi id unum mihi.
Yes exactly.	Ita prorsus.
I will be different	Ego esse aliud
I forgot about this	Oblitus sum de hoc
I have to say that I am	Habeo dicere me esse
I can believe you	Ego te posse credere
He likes to do something.	Velit aliquid.
I did for him	Ego feci pro eo
At the same time.	Per idem tempus.
Just in the night.	Iustus in nocte.
That never happened.	Quod numquam factum est.
This is indeed possible.	Hoc quidem fieri potest.
This was an easy task	Hoc fuit facile opus
I don't want to see	Non vis videre
Now you have me.	Nunc habes me.
i knew you didn't think about me	Scivi non cogitare de me
I probably would	Ego probabiliter esset
It was not bad, it was really good.	Malum non erat, vere bonum erat.
To never say no.	Ut numquam nulla.
This has been done here.	Hoc factum est hic.
Which ones are	Quae sunt.
I just can't do it	Ego iustus non potest facere
For the future.	Futurum enim.
He did all this.	Hoc totum fecit.
She's not coming yet.	Illa tamen non venit.
I did nothing yesterday.	Ego heri nihil feci.
please.	placet.
You do your job.	Facis officium tuum.
I really only wanted to be with him some time	Ego vere solus cum eo aliquo tempore volui
I saw what I was doing.	Vidi quid faceret.
This is well true.	Hoc bene verum est.
I want to say yes	Volo dicere etiam
But someone does the job.	Sed aliquis officium facit.
I can't see what he thinks	Non possum videre quod cogitat
He likes, you know.	Velit, scis.
Maybe as soon as possible this morning.	Forsitan quam primum hoc mane.
I will say nothing.	Nihil dicam.
But this cannot be seen in all.	Sed hoc non potest videri in omnibus.
Now I can see.	Nunc videre possum.
First, father.	Primum, pater.
I knew much before	Sciebam multo ante
There was nothing between us.	Nihil inter nos fuit.
But only one genus.	Sed unum tantum genus.
I got it now	Et obtinuit eam nunc
I thought you could have lunch there	Cogitavi posse habere prandium ibi
The problem is getting on time.	Quaestio hoc tempore questus est.
Even who wants none.	Etiam quis velit nulla.
I know why he did it.	Scio cur id fecerit.
He didn't want to know.	Noluit scire.
I could do pretty well here	Satis bene facere potui hic
We're only here today for you.	Hic hodie tantum tibi sumus.
I wanted.	Volui.
I've never seen it.	Nunquam id vidi.
If he could not.	Nisi posset.
I didn't know what to think anymore	Ego nesciebam quid cogitare amplius
There is so much that is not here.	Non est tantum quod hic non est.
Police said he was out.	Aliquam dictum ex erat.
I was not here.	Hic non essem.
But I never did.	Sed nunquam feci.
May you do something in it.	Sit tibi aliquid in.
I tried to think as I would	Conatus sum cogitare sicut vellet
i did for you too	feci tibi quoque
Soon again.	Mox iterum.
I know you talk to yourself.	Scio te ipsum loqui.
That would work.	Quod esset opus.
I haven't thought through	Non putavit per
I believe you were one yesterday too	Credo te unum heri quoque
Yes, but a great time.	Etiam sed tempus magna.
I hope it works.	Spero opus.
I can't do everything.	Non omnia possum.
I think you're doing well	Puto te bene facere
He looks at me.	Me spectat.
I don't know	Non est scire
I want to see something about this	Volo videre aliquid quod de hoc
Make that one.	Fac ut unum.
I could go on much longer	Non potui ire multo iam
I can't live without him	Non possum vivere sine eo
But he likes it himself.	Sed id ipsum velit.
It is not easy.	Non facile.
Three and three.	Tres et tres.
But that is how much.	Sed id est quantum.
It will be fine for you.	Bene tibi erit.
I just need to see her	Ego iustus opus ad eius
Now in the save.	Nunc in nisi.
I have nothing to do with it.	Ego nihil ad rem.
I wonder how you'd like to do something like that	Miror quomodo velis agere aliquid simile quod
I think what you say is true	Puto quod verum dicit
I will say nothing more	Ego nihil dicam amplius
I wanted to go home already	Ire domum iam volui
That indeed.	Id quidem.
And we all have friends there.	Et nos omnes ibi amicos habemus.
There is something else to do.	Est aliquid aliud facere.
Well done.	Bene factum est.
Probably me.	Probabiliter me.
Now I know what to do	Nunc scio quid facere
But not here.	Sed non, hic.
I could come one day	Venire potui die
I just want to know	Ego iustus volo scire
I have what you want	Habeo quod vis
But that's only what.	Sed id nisi quam.
It is difficult to understand.	Difficile est intelligere.
I just made it	Ego iustus factum est factum
I guess	Suspicor.
If you don't.	Si non facis.
He knew it wasn't to be.	Sciebat non esse ut sit.
Not yet, but soon.	Nondum, sed mox.
Again nothing was done.	Iterum nihil factum est.
I had to stay away from him	Ego quoque ab eo manere
I can't do anything wrong	Non possum facere quicquam mali
That's what we've come here to do.	Id quod nos huc ad faciendum venit.
I have seen and heard all things	Vidi et audivi omnia
I want to talk to you	Volo loqui tecum
I need to know where I was	Mihi opus est scire ubi esset
I have enough to do.	Habeo satis facere.
It was too late.	Sero erat.
He said, "You can only do what you can."	Dixit, hoc solum facere potes quod potes.
I'm not anyone you	Ego ne quis te
You'd like to see me.	Videre libet mihi.
I haven't gone too long	Et non nimis diu abiit
This does not stop there.	Hic prohibere non est.
You have what I feel.	Habes quod sentio.
He didn't want to think.	Noluit cogitare.
I never thought it would happen like this	Numquam sic futurum putavi
and you have.	et habes.
At least you know something.	Certe aliquid scis.
I can speak with him but I can't speak	Cum eo loqui possum, sed loqui non potest
I want to win the race.	Volo vincere genus.
But there was.	Sed erat.
This he did indeed.	Hoc vere fecit.
I know him	Scio se ipsum
I just want to do that's what it is	Ego iustus volo fac ut 'quid sit'
There is no need to think or speak or act	Non opus est cogitare vel loqui vel agere
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
I know you too well	Scio te nimium bene
And you want to know who that person was.	Et vis scire quis homo esset.
This could not be true.	Hoc verum esse non potuit.
I don't know what to say	nescio quid dicam
just stop trying me at all	Me solum prohibere conatur omnino
I couldn't believe this happens	Hoc fieri non potui credere
It is still there.	Adhuc sit.
this has never been done before.	id numquam ante me factum est.
Play again if not necessary	Iterum ludere non nisi necesse est
I will do it myself.	Faciam ipse.
and yet he is not going.	et adhuc non eat.
We need some help	Hoc opus est aliquo auxilio
i want you to know him.	eum volo te scire.
I wanted to stop and see	Volui prohibere et videre
i don't know what to do	nescio quid facere
I knew correctly	Sciebam recte
You have to believe in yourself.	Credere habes in te.
I hope to do it in	Spero facere in illo
What he said to him.	Quae dixit ei.
I can't talk to anyone about this	Non possum loqui quis de hoc
Please stay where you are.	Quaeso mane ubi es.
could remain.	manere posset.
I don't want to know anything	Nolo scire aliquid
But it is not the same.	Sed non est ipsum.
I thought often.	Saepe cogitavi.
I don't want anyone to think that	Nolo quis cogitare quod
Traveling video	Iter hic video
I need to overcome this and be with him	Mihi opus est ut hoc vincere et cum eo
I really like it here	Ego vere amo is hic
he was ready.	paratus erat.
It could not be too late.	Sero esse non potuit.
At first he thought it.	Primum id putabat.
But that was not true.	Quod tamen non fuit.
I can't think of who it is	Non possum cogitare de quis sit
And he wanted to see her again.	Et iterum voluit videre eam.
Perhaps she could persuade him to do the right thing.	Forsitan persuadere posset rem recte facere.
Maybe at home before noon	Forte ante meridiem domi
Yes there is nothing.	Etiam est nisi.
I wonder if you have this	Miror si hoc habes
Soon enough, there.	Satis cito, ibi.
I can do everything for all.	Omnia possum omnibus.
It always.	Sic semper.
May it be that.	Sit ut.
Tried to see you	Conatus ad vos
I never came home this time	Numquam venit in domum hoc tempore
But not the whole evil.	Sed non totum malum.
I could see many things, but it was enough	Non potui videre multa, sed satis erat
I was ready to see him	Paratus eram illum videre
This is generally difficult.	Hoc fere difficile est.
One at a time.	Unum ad tempus.
I am not more than	Ego non plus quam
I didn't want to talk to him	Nolui loqui ei
I have not done that	Non feci quod
Next time I'll be there	Iterum ego te ibi
I can see through him	Per ipsum videre possum
He knew the room behind him.	Post eum cubiculum scivit.
It is not.	Non est.
Just said enough.	Dictum modo satis est.
Nothing bad would have happened.	Nisi malum futurum erat.
I know what this means	Scio quid hoc modo
So he was with me.	Sic mecum erat.
not what is mine.	non quod meum est.
I thought I would do the same	Putavi facturum idem
I hope all is good today and better in the day	Spero omnia bona hodie, et melius in dies
He was my father.	pater erat.
No order from anyone.	Ut quis nulla ex.
I could not do this	Hoc facere non potui
It's time to go ahead.	Aliquam a erat ante.
But that is not enough.	Sed id parum est.
I didn't know what to do with you	Ego nesciebam quid faciam ex vobis
i thought both of them happened	Putabam utrumque factum
And not even him.	Et ne ipsum quidem.
I believe he thinks I should be	Credo putat me esse
I know better than	Ego scio melius quam
I don't have a job	Ego non habeo officium
I never did that	Numquam feci quod
I barely know where he is	Vix scio ubi sit
She's never even met a man	Vir illa nunquam etiam occurrit
I hope you don't understand correctly	Spero te non recte intelligere
Maybe now was the time.	Aliquam nunc tempus erat.
All right, he's right.	Recte ille recte.
I really just couldn't do it without my help.	Ego vere iustus sine auxilio id facere non potui.
You don't always need someone to do what you don't want.	Non semper debes aliquem facere quod non vis.
I totally believe you	Prorsus credo te
Not much here, really.	Hic non multum, vere.
If you are great.	Si magna.
I have nothing but you	Nihil habeo nisi te
I thought yesterday	Cogitavi heri
So to be with everyone.	Sic esse cum omnibus.
I very much like to see	Valde amo video
They are all there.	Ibi omnia sunt.
But none and none at all.	Sed et nulla nulla.
That could be really bad.	Quod mali potuit vere.
This is mine.	Hoc est meum.
I tried to think.	Conatus cogitare.
I didn't know about you	Ego nesciebam eum de te
I am very pleased indeed	Sum admodum quidem
This seems hard to see and believe.	Hoc videre et credere difficile videtur.
I feel from you.	Sentio a te.
But that's not the same thing.	Ut non ipsum nisi.
It was totally done for me	Mihi prorsus factum est
I don't even see it	Non quidem videre eam
He was not alone.	Solus non erat.
That's nothing new.	Id nihil novi.
I am going to sit	Ego sum facturus sit
We need help.	Nobis auxilium opus est.
it makes us good enough.	satis nos facit.
Today, it is no longer there.	Hodie, id est iam non est.
I can't be here for a long time	Non possum hic esse diu
I am that very kind guy	Ego sum id ipsum genus guy
Now that's you.	Nunc id te.
He would not come to her.	Noluit ad eam venire.
My time is gone.	Tempus meum abiit.
However, I don't know anything.	Tamen non aliquid novi.
They just don't talk.	Non solum non loqui.
Which is true.	Quod verum est.
Don't think about anything.	Noli cogitare aliquid.
There was nothing new.	Nihil erat novi.
But never for it.	Sed numquam enim.
No you don't have any.	Nulla non aliquam est.
I wanted nothing to do with it.	Nihil volui tibi facere cum illo.
Do this as much as you want.	Hoc fac quantum vis.
I'm sorry too.	Paenitet etiam.
It is now.	Nunc est.
I know my family.	Novi genus meum.
He is with me.	Mecum est.
I see nothing.	Nihil video.
It hasn't always been	Hoc non semper fuit
That's the name.	Id nomen.
Follow me again.	Iterum post me.
I don't think the same thing anymore	Non videtur idem amplius
When he wishes, he cannot remain.	Cum vellet, manere non potest.
It really is something.	Aliquid vere est.
It could never be done.	Fieri numquam posset.
I hope he is happy.	Spero quod est felix.
often heard	Saepe audivi
Which is more than we can say.	Quod plus est quam possumus dicere.
I'm trying not to think about it	Ego conatur non cogitare de illo
He never thought that.	Nunquam id putabat.
I don't feel this way	Non sentio hoc modo
Good thing	Bona res.
But also before him.	Sed et ipsum ante.
I don't think it can be done	Non puto posse fieri
Now about that.	Nunc ut.
I heard you coming.	Audivi te venire.
Not with you.	Non apud te.
I love you all, but	Omnes vos amo, sed
I was told who, what, when and where	Dictum est mihi quis, quid, quando et ubi
But there was none at all.	Sed non erat nulla.
Where to find you.	Ubi invenire te.
But not to true evil.	Sed non ad verum malum.
He wants to see you, and that's where you are.	Te videre vult, et hoc ubi es.
But no time before.	Nulla sed tempus ante.
Looks good right now.	Bonum nunc spectat.
I'm not even home.	Ego ne domi quidem.
I can't live without you, my love	Sine te vivere non possum, mea
I wanted it, but I wanted it through you	Ego id, sed me per te voluit
It is not for me to say.	Non est mihi dicere.
I can't say anything with him	Non possum dicere aliquid cum eo
I want you to accept this	Volo te hoc accipere
Perhaps you did, but perhaps you did not.	Fortasse fecisti, sed fortasse non fecisti.
I want my father here	Volo hic pater meus
I thought with myself.	Cogitavi mecum.
Hardly any longer.	Iam vix.
I can still do the same!	Idem possum etiam facere!
I just need me	Ego iustus opus ad me
I'm just pretty	Ego tantum satis
I have great things to do.	Habeo magna facere.
I have seen it too.	Vidi etiam.
I want to go to school	Volo ire ad scholam
I need to stop	Me prohibere debeo
I don't know yet.	Nescio adhuc.
I could not accept this.	Hoc accipere non potui.
I didn't know much about him	Ego nesciebam multa de eo
Tomorrow to get out.	Cras ut ex.
I can't live like this	Non possum sic vivere
Just go home	Mox ire domum
I didn't see what it was	Non vide quid esset
You know you can do it.	Scis te facere posse.
I wanted to see her now	Volui ad eam iam nunc
He could not.	Non potuit.
I didn't know what to do anymore	Ego nesciebam quid faciam amplius
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
I knew he was saying something to me	Sciebam se dicere quod mihi
I did well, but it wasn't the thing.	Bene me fecit, sed non erat res.
It is so bad.	Ita malum est.
Here's the way to help.	Hic cum auxilio est iter.
What you know, you know.	Quod scis, scis.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id erat ipsum.
But this is not possible.	Sed hoc non potest.
It's not his job.	Non est suum officium.
Now that's up.	Nunc ut est est.
I work for myself	Ego ad me opus
I told him about you all	Dixi ei de omnibus vobis
I wasn't sure who it was	Non eram certus quis esset
Mine is not bad.	Meum non est malum.
I plan to come home to help, but I don't have	Cogitavi domum venire adiuvare, sed non habet
But that never happened.	Sed id numquam.
He came hither.	Huc venit.
But they are for us.	Sed sunt nobis.
I wasn't sure about it	Ego certe non erat de eo
I did something for you.	Aliquid pro te feci.
I really don't like it	Ego vere non placet
It's not true.	Suus 'non est verum.
But I could do nothing	Ego autem nihil potui
I can see that they understand	Non possum videre se intelligere
I want him to come	Volo eum venire
It will be great.	Magna erit.
The work must be done.	Opus faciendum.
Let's be honest now.	Sit amet nunc.
Not even that.	Ne id quidem.
I never saw anything like this	Numquam vidi aliquid simile hoc
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
I could not do this	Hoc facere non potui
Now he knew why.	Nunc scivit quare.
I tried everything to live with him	Conatus sum omnia de eo vivere
I can't believe I'm going to do it	Non possum credere me facturum esse
I was ready to deal with him	Paratus eram agere cum illo
I haven't even seen where I went	Me ne vidi quidem ubi abiit
But that's none of it.	Sed id ipsum nulla.
And he went home and saw him	Et abiit in domum suam et vidi eum
but he still knows who he is.	sed adhuc scit quis sit;
I just don't believe you.	Non solum non credo.
And yours too.	Et tua quoque.
You know that I am alone.	Solus esse scis.
I think someone knows.	Puto aliquem scire.
He didn't want to see her again.	Noluit videre eam iterum.
I thought about it this morning	Cogitavi etiam de hoc mane
I don't know what he's talking about	Nescio quid loquitur
He does everything right.	Ut omnia recte facit.
I completely forgot	Omnino oblitus sum
I love you as you are	Te amo ut es
This one looked pretty similar.	Hoc unum satis simile vidi.
I can't be sure that	Non possum non certus quod
He came to my office.	Venit ad officium meum.
He is not alone.	Non solum est.
I couldn't think of anything.	Non potui cogitare de aliquo.
He knows that he is there.	Scit se esse ibi.
Don't stop anything.	Non aliquid prohibere.
I just didn't know who it was.	Modo nesciebat quis esset.
I didn't know him very well	Ego nesciebam eum optime
Not even one.	Ne unum quidem.
Getting one was just good.	Questus unus erat iustus bonus.
Why I could not understand	Cur non potui intelligere
I'm afraid I won't be alone	Vereor ne solus erit
I see what I'm up to	Ego quod ad me videre
I need to talk to someone	Mihi opus est loqui ad aliquem
This is, you think.	Hoc est, putas.
I knew that was better	Sciebam quod erat melius
I told you, man.	Dixi tibi, vir.
You don't want to happen	Non vis forte
But I don't get any of it.	Sed non aliquam ex.
Don't do it.	Ne feceris.
I know enough	Scio satis
I just want to know where I was	EGO iustus volo scire ubi esset
I thought i love her	Cogitavi te amo eam
he knew he was not going to be.	Sciebat se non futurum esse sciebat.
This is not true.	Hoc non est.
And he did it.	Et fecit.
I need some help here.	Hic opus est aliquo auxilio.
Why don't I see her?	Cur non video eam uxorem
It can indeed and often is.	Potest quidem et saepe est.
I'm sorry if something happened to him	Me paenitet si quid ei factum est
she was very happy.	valde felix fuit.
Yes that is me.	Ita ut ad me.
I know exactly where we are now.	Novi prorsus ubi nunc sumus.
I need him	Mihi opus est ad eum
All I could give him	Omnia ei dare potui
Now tell me about it.	Nunc dic mihi de illa.
I can not.	Non possum.
I can't say one thing about it just by looking	Non possum dicere unum de hoc modo per vultus
Why I wasn't sure	Cur non eram certus
I couldn't think of anything else	Non potui cogitare de aliud
I know that would help.	Scio fore auxilium.
If only I ever wanted it again.	Modo si umquam illud iterum volui.
and another too.	et aliud quoque.
He has nothing to do with this.	Nihil ad hoc habet.
I hope to play better tomorrow	Spero melius cras ludere
I can't get enough.	Non possum satis.
He knows where you are.	Novit ubi sis.
I totally understand that	Ego prorsus intelligere quod
I wish you were here	Utinam hic
i don't know what to do	nescio quid faciendum
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
I've done it for years.	Ego annos feci.
As before	Ut ante
I'm going home.	Nunc domum.
No one wants to do what you do.	Nec vult facere quod facis.
I think that's what I mean.	Puto id quod vult.
I need to do that somehow	Mihi opus est facere quae aliquo modo
I couldn't even hear	Ego ne audire quidem potui
They are also men.	Homines quoque sunt.
it was in me, and not in me.	in me erat, et non me.
You've got lucky.	Tu felix obtinuit.
I can't stay here longer.	Hic diutius manere non possum.
He did not say to me.	Non dixit mihi.
Don't like it.	Nonne placet.
I never heard of him	Numquam audivi ex eo
You want too much.	Nimium vis.
I could see something	Non potui videre aliquid
No one did it anymore.	Nemo id amplius fecit.
I never met a man.	Numquam occurrit homo.
And this time it was made true for us.	Et tempore hoc verum pro nobis factum est.
Yes, he was not.	Etiam nec erat erat.
He has not.	Non habet.
I wanted what I wanted	volui, quid volui
I wasn't sure if he wanted to talk to me	Ego certe non eram, si mecum voluit loqui
Now she looks this way.	Hoc modo nunc non spectat.
I've been through a lot, yes	Fui per multum, etiam
He didn't say anything to me.	Non dixit mihi quicquam.
There is no need to know.	Non est scire.
All about that.	Omnes ut.
To be honest for you.	Ut sit amet enim.
But he does something more.	Sed plus agit aliquid.
Not yet sure.	Nondum certe.
You know how it is.	Scis quomodo id sit.
I am very surprised at him.	Valde miror eum.
You'll never like it.	Numquam tibi placet.
I know what you like	Scio quid simile
It is not enough.	Parum est.
I never thought of you again	Non cogitavi ut vos iterum:
So it is.	Ita est.
He said nothing to me.	Nihil mihi dixit.
You don't have to win.	Vincere non habes.
I know you people.	Novi vos homines.
You need to stay where you are.	Manere ubi sis debes.
Please don't do it.	Quaeso ne feceris.
Now he doesn't want to.	Nunc non velit.
I need to play.	Ludere opus est.
I knew at the time	Sciebam tempore
It could be one day.	Posset, dies unus.
Only help.	Tantum auxilium.
He has not, he is not.	Non habet, non est.
Nothing really happened there.	Vere nihil ibi factum est.
I didn't know what	Nesciebam quid
He is very happy.	Sit amet ipsum.
And they are good.	Et bona sunt.
He will do it.	Facturus est.
That it was.	Quod esset.
I don't have much post	Ego non multo post
I didn't know it was going to be	Ego nesciebam eum esse futurum
I can't believe what it is	Non possum credere quod est
I didn't think so a little while ago.	Non ita putavi paulo ante.
But that is none.	Sed id nulla est.
I hope you can understand this	Spero te posse intelligere hoc
I never saw anything like	Numquam vidi aliquid simile
I don't need to do that.	Non opus est facere.
Everything I wanted with me	Omnia volui mecum
Who wants.	Velit quis.
I am getting used to this class right now.	Ego sum questus ad hoc nunc genus.
But the question is before us.	Sed quaestio est ante nos.
I also like you	Ego autem et sicut tu
I'm not sure yet.	Ego certe nondum ibi sum.
I don't need any help for him	Non opus est aliquo auxilio pro eo
I can't speak but you	Non possum dicere nisi tu
I couldn't do this now	Non potui amplius hoc nunc
I couldn't get up yet	Non potui ut usque adhuc
I told you	Ego dixi vobis
I knew what was going to happen	Sciebam quid esset futurum
I never thought I would do something like that from me	Numquam putavi fore ut aliquid simile a me
You have time for everything.	Omnia tempus habes.
But that's the time now.	Sed id tempus nunc.
Now you have friends.	Nunc amicos habes.
I hope that will be enough	Spero quod satis erit
I know what you like.	Scio quid simile.
I don't think anything else about it	Non cogitare aliquid aliud de illo
Don't think who it was	Fac cogitare non quis esset
He looked good, he thought.	Vidit bonum, putabat.
I don't know what to fight for.	Nescio quid pro.
To carry out the work.	Ad faciendum opus.
Come to me baby boy	Venit ad me puer puer
I am so lucky to have you	Ego sum ita felix habere
But it was not always.	Sed non semper erat.
But he was before.	Sed ante erat.
Tomorrow in which.	Cras in quam.
It's not done.	Non est factum.
Haven't really met anyone here yet	Non vere occurrit quis hic adhuc
I love you a lot too	Multum amo te, etiam
I want you to give it to me	Volo enim vos ut mihi eam
Doing his evil work.	Faciens opus suum malum.
I don't know where the time went.	Nescio ubi tempus abiit.
I don't know at all	Nescio omnino
I tried to tell you	Conatus sum tibi dicere
Time to play.	Tempus ludere.
Well, better than maybe.	Bene, melius quam fortasse.
I never wanted to see him again	Numquam volui videre eum iterum
i think we can all be in	Puto posse nos omnes in
I certainly don't like that one.	Certe non placet unum.
Truly it was done.	Vere factum est.
I can't come to see you today	Non possum venire te videre hodie
I think we can stay here	Puto hic manere si possumus
It does not please.	Non placet.
Nothing, really.	Nihil, vere.
I certainly don't always like it.	Id certe non semper placet.
And well indeed.	Et bene quidem.
I need to go back to her.	Ire ad eam debeo.
I don't regret se	Non paenitet se
As it was.	Sicut erat.
But he.	Sed ille.
Now he was in him.	Nunc in ipsum erat.
I did not say no more.	non dixi, non amplius.
I made my way to him	Ego feci iter ad eum
He did not see, but.	Non vidit, sed.
I just can't believe that	Ego iustus potest credere quod
If not before.	Nisi ante.
I could never get enough of this	Numquam satis hoc potui
We still have.	Nos adhuc habemus.
You can do whatever you want.	Potes quod vis.
He always looks.	Semper spectat.
He said yes.	Ita etiam dixit.
I am still the same me	Ego tamen idem me
which I could see.	quod videre potui.
I didn't want to say	Non volui dicere
I can't take it anymore	Non possum accipere amplius
i think i need someone to want you	Puto opus aliquem velle te
I never wanted anything more.	Nunquam quicquam volui amplius.
if again it is.	si iterum est.
I love you all	Te amo omnia es
So there you have it.	Ita ibi habes.
Never go with him	Numquam ire cum eo
I can't say anything here	Non possum dicere quod hic
That is not easy by itself.	Quod non est facile per se ipsum.
It's his.	Eius est.
Is your job.	An officium tuum.
i have help nothing	habeo auxilium, nihil
how to speak.	quam loqui.
I want more than this	Volo plus quam hoc
To or never before.	Ut vel numquam ante.
Don't get me wrong, she thought.	Ne male, putavit.
I told you all this before	Dixi vobis omnia haec ante
I told him everything.	Omnia ei dixi.
Take a look at the money.	Vide pecuniam.
Let me do this.	Fac me hoc.
I can't do this anymore.	Hoc amplius facere non possum.
I can see this now.	Hoc nunc videre possum.
Yes that was said out.	Etiam id dictum ex.
He never even knew his real name.	Numquam etiam nomen eius verum scivit.
I can still see how it's	Non possum tamen videre quam illud
And so he did.	Et sic fecit.
And finally how to go	Et tandem modo ei ire
Yes, it was not.	Etiam non erat.
I tried to play easy on you	Conatus sum ludere facile in te
There is a real need.	Verum opus est.
But certainly not all.	Sed certe non omnes.
I didn't think much before	Non puto multo ante
i am just not sure what to do with it yet	Ego iustus non certus quid facere cum eo adhuc
Certainly not one.	Certe non unum.
I thought you would help.	Putabam te adiuvare.
Perhaps it is so.	Forsitan ita sit.
i thought just for the night	Putabam iustus pro nocte
For him.	Pro eo.
That it is not.	Quod non.
Even never see.	Etiam numquam videre.
But I don't like it.	Sed non placet.
No but him now.	Nulla sed ipsum nunc.
It's probably not good.	Probabiliter non est bonum.
which perhaps.	quam fortasse.
This he said.	Hoc ille dixit.
I never thought of it again.	Numquam iterum cogitavi.
I know them all.	Novi omnes.
I can't do this without you	Non possum hoc facere sine te
I didn't know what this meant	Ego nesciebam quid hoc esset
I want to talk about you.	de te loqui volo.
I need to know.	Scire opus est.
I always do a good job	Ego semper bene facere officium est
At last it's already enough.	Tandem iam satis est.
I don't think anything of it	Non cogitare aliquid ex eo
And that was done.	Id autem factum est.
Never need anyone else	Numquam quis aliud opus
Now at least I can't find it	Nunc certe invenire non possum
I never thought the whole thing	Numquam videbatur totum
I thought last night	Cogitavi nocte
It was yesterday after all.	Erat heri post omnes.
What's the matter.	Quid ad rem.
don't do this to you	Non hoc tibi
I tried not to listen to him	Conatus sum non audire eum
I believe it can be done.	fieri posse credo.
I really don't know what to do	Ego vere nescio quid haec facit
I have never been there for anything.	Numquam ibi quicquam.
I really think you like it	Ego vere cogitare tibi placet
But that is the same.	Sed id est ipsum.
I couldn't help myself	Non potui ne me adiuvet
I know what's wrong with him	Scio quid mali ei
Now that's wrong.	Id nunc malum.
I can't say how much this is	Non possum dicere quantum hoc est
Don't be like this.	Noli sic esse.
and you know.	et scis.
They are: a.	Sunt, a.
What he did not say.	Quod non dixit.
I don't like it.	Non mihi placet.
The first time I see him	Primum video illum
It's not easy	Non facile esse
But the thing is similar.	Similis tamen res est.
I don't need it tonight	Ego hac nocte non opus est
That it is so.	Quod ita sit.
I want to think about this	Volo cogitare de hoc
This does not seem right.	Hoc non recte videtur.
He does his work and comes prepared.	Opus suum facit, et venit paratus.
and yet he does.	et tamen facit.
And if from.	Et si ex.
That's still the way to go.	Quod adhuc iter est.
I'm done for sure	Ego feci ut certus
i think i can do it	Puto posse facere
I want you for dinner	Volo te ad prandium
But not before.	Sed non ante.
Never say	Numquam dicere
I only know what is not true.	Tantum scio quod non est verum.
But the time itself.	Sed tempus ipsum.
I don't want to do it again.	Nolo iterum ut faciam.
I really like both.	Ego vere amo utrumque.
You don't do many things.	Multa multa non facis.
Get some on this here.	Hac aliquam huc.
Doing their work is not your job.	Facere opus suum non est officium tuum.
It was great, but I don't know enough.	Multum erat, sed nescio quid satis.
I did so	Ego feci ita
I want people to know that you're not alone	Volo homines scire quod tu non solum
He doesn't want this to happen.	Non vult hoc fieri.
Not only one.	Non nisi quis.
I want to believe, but	Credere volo, sed
But I don't want to believe	Ego autem non vis credere
I'm not really talking about you	Ego non vere de te
I just want to know why	Ego iustus volo scire quare
I could not go.	ire non potui.
as i did.	sicut ego feci.
I have to think.	Habeo cogitare.
I need to talk to him	Mihi opus est dicere ei
Absolutely, exactly.	Prorsus, Prorsus.
I barely have time for anything else	Ego vix tempus aliud
You know that's not true.	Scis quod non est verum.
I want you to help yourself	Volo tibi auxilium te ipsum
I know it's what you think	Scio suus quid cogitas
It does not please.	Non placet.
I did what anyone could do	Ego feci quod quis facere
Here I wanted for him	Hic volui pro eo
You can't be.	Non potes esse.
I told you not everything but	Non omnia dixi vobis, sed
I wanted to see this	Hoc volui videre mihi
I've done my job.	Ego feci officium meum.
For I am not that man	Ego enim non sum ille
I need to believe him	Mihi opus est credere ei
He was still a boy, but was no longer a boy.	Puer adhuc erat, sed iam puer non erat.
I wanted to act, not to speak	Volui agere, non loqui
Look a little.	Parum vide.
I want to do it with him	Volo facere cum eo
I can't say that everything really did work	Non possum dicere quod omnia vere fecit opus
I am so happy to be at home	Ego tam felix esse domi
I think it could not be done	Puto fieri non posse
Well done! 	Bene!
He did not think so.	Non putavit.
I'll do whatever you want.	Faciam quod vis.
You are none other than that.	Nulla es quam.
That's what I do.	Id facio.
You don't have anything.	Non habes aliquid.
I could be a boy	Puer esse potui
But he never came home.	Sed domum numquam venit.
Maybe she could still live.	Forsitan adhuc vivere posset.
I know what's happening	Scio quid suus fieri
This is not the first time.	Hoc primum non est.
His dog is just in front of him.	Modo ante illum est canis eius.
I'm afraid it is up to you	Vereor ne sit ad vos
Now she is a good dog.	Iam canis bonus est.
i think that's even more than	Puto quod et plus quam
I want one and that was	Volo unum et quod fuit
Something's going to happen.	Aliquid futurum est.
That's just what you know to do.	Id solum scis facere.
I just love her so much	Ego iustus amo eam tam
I hope to be there	Spero esse ibi
I can do it for you	Non possum facere vobis
I know what is wrong with him	Scio quid sit male cum eo
I can't stop looking	Non possum prohibere vultus
But there is another.	Est autem aliud.
I wonder which one it is.	Miror quod unum est.
I can't believe this is happening to me	Hoc mihi fieri non possum credere
He has gone, he has just gone.	Abiit, modo abiit.
I am sure of it	Certus sum eam esse
I'll do what you need to do	Faciam quod debes facere
I want to do it again.	Iterum volo facere.
I can't even see you like him	Te videre possum etiam ei similis
He did not do this.	Hoc non fecit.
Enough, enough, already enough.	Satis, satis, jam satis.
He wanted nothing.	Nihil voluit.
That's how important it is.	Ut sit amet quam.
I'm afraid too much.	Nimium vereor.
I have a lot to do today.	Multa habeo hodie facere.
To be with you.	Ut sit tibi.
I wanted to believe it	Credere volui eam
Not yet well done.	Nondum bene.
But who knows what he will do.	Sed quis scit quid facturus sit.
He could do it.	Posset facere.
This is good	Hoc bonum est
I don't want to play	Non vis ludere
I knew he would have	Sciebam se habere
I was ready for you all	Paratus eram tibi omnia
I said I was okay.	Dixi me bene esse.
Never let me do anything	Numquam me facere quicquam
You can do this	Et hoc facere potest
I never thought this could happen	Numquam putavi hoc fieri posse
i never did it.	numquam id feci.
I could see him	Non potui videre eum
I know nothing about him.	Nihil de eo scio.
I don't really want to know.	Non vere scire vis.
They are not.	Non sunt.
I know everything like that	Scio omnia sicut quod
To be able to do well.	Bene facere posse est.
It was the same with him.	Simile erat ei.
As much as I love him always	Quantum amo illum semper
But don't stay there.	Sed noli ibi manere.
You don't get so much money.	Tantum pecuniae non facis.
I know what you can	Scio quid potes
And you've done everything well for me	Et bene omnia fecisti mihi
There is no need to talk about it.	Nihil opus est de illo loqui.
Which never happened.	Quae numquam.
We need your help	Non opus est tibi auxilium
There will not be.	Ibi non esse.
To him.	Ad eum.
But it is well.	Sed bene est.
we can only see.	tantum videre possumus.
No one has seen you.	Nemo te vidit.
I had that day	Habui illa die
I am sure it will be	certus sum, erit
But that said nothing.	Sed id dictum nulla.
I could hear you yesterday.	Te heri audire potui.
He did good to me in that way.	Bonum mihi fecit illo modo.
I knew she didn't like it	Sciebam se non placet
You are so good boy.	Tam bonus puer.
Nothing more.	Nihil amplius.
But it is not at all.	Sed omnino non est.
Certainly you are not.	Certe non es.
But he made himself speak.	Sed ipse loqui fecit.
It was a good decision.	Bonum consilium fuit.
You do not want.	Non vis.
I'm not with anyone.	Non sum cum aliquo.
That's not much.	Non multum illud est.
I wanted it to be.	id esse volui.
You don't even travel this way.	Hoc tibi ne iter quidem.
It was still hard to believe	Adhuc difficile credere erat
It certainly could have been better.	Melius certe potuit.
Good for you or someone else.	Bonum est tibi vel aliquis.
It could be done.	Fieri potuit.
It's time to love yourself.	Aliquam ut ipsum.
I never saw him.	numquam eum vidi.
It's enough for me.	Mihi satis est.
i thought i was going to be with him.	Putabam ire cum eo.
I am more than happy to help	Ego plus quam felix auxilium
I don't think you can do that.	Non puto esse quod potes.
I want to be with her	Volo fieri cum suo
I believe you met him	Occurrit tibi, credo, ei
You have me.	Me habes.
I just love her man	Ego iustus amo eam vir
I don't like this job.	Hoc officium non placet.
I can do this, thought	Hoc facere possum, putavit
who knows how to do it.	quis scit quomodo id.
he seemed to have forgotten.	Oblitus ei videbatur.
Just don't feel like doing bad things.	Iustus non placet facere malum.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I just want to do something more about it	EGO iustus volo ut aliquid plus de eo
often here.	Saepe hic.
I was ready and didn't know	Paratus eram et non sciebat
He does well.	Bene facit.
I want to tell her that	Volo dicere ei quod
To just sit	Ut iustus sit
This is very bad.	Hoc valde malum est.
That will not be.	Quod non erit.
Now I want to hear from you.	Nunc te audire volo.
in.	in.
Time is one thing, which is evil.	Tempus unum est, quod malum est.
But this is not seen.	Sed id non videtur.
Yes it is here.	Ita est hic.
I hope we're not too late	Spero nos non nimium sero
I am not surprised at all	Ego omnino non miror
Not very well.	Non multum bene.
I guess	Suspicor.
Never let me do that.	Numquam me facere.
I didn't know how long.	Ego nesciebam quam diu.
I really don't want to leave tomorrow.	Vere volo cras non relinquere.
I also like my trip	Ego quoque mea similis iter
All right, that was what I needed.	Recte, id quod opus erat.
This is what I've just done.	Hoc est quod nuper factum est.
I also understand her	Ego quoque in eam intelligere
She could do something.	Posset aliquid facere.
She's still got it.	Illa tamen obtinuit.
I will definitely stay again	Ego certe manere iterum
Now it has begun.	Nunc incepit.
i can see you know something.	videre possum te aliquid scire.
It was too much for him.	Nimium erat ei.
He did not do this enough.	Hoc non satis fecit.
I see in you only what I need	Video in te solum quod opus est
I have done nothing.	nihil feci.
I wonder who this guy is	Miror qui hoc guy est
Not well, but better.	Non bene, sed melius.
I need to get to the car	Mihi opus est ut ad currus
I was here for me	Hic eram per me
Make something out of it.	Fac ex eo aliquid.
I do now for you	Ego nunc tibi
It's okay for me to think.	Sic bene est de me cogitare.
You have the money.	Habes pecuniam.
I just came to him like this	Modo venit ad eum sic
I really agree with you	Ego vere cum non
Now, if she'll be with him.	Iam illa cum eo erit si.
I was ready to tell you	Paratus eram tibi dicere
I just thought of this	Ego iustus cogitavi hoc
not a lot of time.	Non multum temporis.
He is gone.	Abiit.
I just can't do it, I don't know why.	Modo se facere non potest, nescio cur.
I can give it to you now	Nunc tibi dare possum
Not exactly mine.	Non mea prorsus.
I will say a little about this, perhaps	De hoc parum dicam, fortasse
I tried to listen and understand.	Audire et intelligere conatus sum.
I know very well.	optime scio.
I want to understand what you did	Volo intelligere quid fecerit
I really didn't know him well	Ego vere nesciebam eum bene
I am not quite sure how long.	Quam diu non sum satis certus.
I can't do this thing	Non possum hanc rem
That one thing is the same.	Quod unum idem.
It was from the Police.	Aliquam a erat erat.
I can't think of that	Non possum cogitare de illo
I like a lot about it	Mihi placet multum de eo
i am really not sure	Ego vere non certus
Just like you.	Sicut tu.
I didn't know him	Et ego nesciebam eum
I have everything to do here	Habeo omnia facere huc
I need to know me	Mihi opus est scire me
I need to stay away from it	Mihi opus est manere ex eo
He must see in this way.	Videre debet hoc modo.
All is well now.	Omnia bene tempus.
He certainly did enough.	Certe satis fecit.
That was really good.	Quod vere bonum fuit.
All	Omnes.
I hope you often stop	Spero te saepe prohibere
If you want, we can talk.	Si vis, possumus loqui.
I want the same	Volo idem
I didn't know what time it was	Nesciebam quo tempore esset
I don't know what you mean.	Nescio quid velis.
I know this is not everything	Scio hoc non omnia
He does it for me.	Pro me agit.
Too much time.	Nimium tempus.
Maybe it's fun or something else.	Fortasse amet, vel aliquid aliud.
I can't do everything	Non possum facere omnia
Can't wait to do that.	Nescit facere.
I thought that was	Cogitavi quod erat
But perhaps this could be prevented.	Posset tamen hoc fortasse prohibere.
I'm afraid it's getting late	Vereor ne sero sibi questus sit
You are not a man.	Non homo.
There was again.	Fuit iterum.
I like what you say	Mihi placet quod dicit
That's what I think.	Id puto.
I just love him.	Modo ipsum.
I will travel with him	Ego iter ad illum
I badly need someone to talk to	Ego male opus aliquis loqui
A lot.	Sit amet.
yet I am not.	adhuc non sum.
I could barely speak	Vix loqui potui
Now is the time.	Nunc id tempus est.
He also wants to choose from.	Etiam velit velit ex.
I actually like this too.	Mihi quidem placet hoc quoque.
I haven't gone on time	Et non abiit in tempore
That's where we are.	Id ubi sumus.
I don't know exactly.	Nescio prorsus.
I have one go	Habeo unum ire
I don't want to be here	Nolo hic esse
Now I know what it is.	Nunc scio quid sit.
This one is for me.	Hoc unum mihi est.
It's still a job.	Officium tamen est.
I have seen and heard enough	Vidi et audivi satis
and never will.	et numquam erit.
I wanted something else.	Aliud volui.
Not much to say about him	Non multa dicere de illo
But this will not be so easy.	Sed hoc non tam facile futurum est.
Someone could say something.	Aliquis aliquid dicere potuit.
No, not for yourself.	Nulla non enim ipsum.
Great great things.	Magna magna.
I heard yesterday come	Audivi heri venire
Something is very wrong.	Valde aliquid mali est.
I know you're doing well	Scio te bene facere
I wanted to stay here	Hic manere volui
You don't like me.	Non sicut me.
I can't think of anything to do	Non possum cogitare de aliquid facere
But I will be there again tonight.	Sed erit ibi iterum hac nocte.
It will be the same.	Idem erit.
Well, now.	Bene, nunc.
Rightly indeed.	Recte quidem.
i think i can say	Puto posse dicere
One thing indeed.	Unum quidem.
But you can't.	Sed non potes.
I don't know who this is.	Nescio quis id sit.
You can do it.	Facere potes.
I will soon	Ego cito
I believe you really do like me now	Credo vere facere sicut me nunc
I heard really good, but hard.	Audivi vere bonum, sed difficile.
what's up with her?.	Quid ad eam ?.
We just have to see you.	Te solum habemus videre.
Tell me.	Dic mihi.
I know you're the only thing to do about it	Scio te solum aliquid de eo facere
yet I believe in you	credo te tamen
I wonder what it was	Miror quid esset
You're nothing like him.	Nihil simile ei es.
It was too much.	Nimium erat.
I saw you there this morning	Vidi ibi hanc mane
Never and never.	Numquam et numquam.
I finally needed to be able to.	Tandem opus est ut potui.
It could not have been done.	Fieri non potuit .
I can't stop him.	Non possum eum prohibere.
I want to tell you something	Volo tibi dicere aliquid
I think we're going to be good.	Puto nos ad bonum esse.
There are a lot of people.	Non multum homines sunt.
I never do	Numquam ego facio
Of what I love.	De hoc quod amo.
I knew what it was	sciebam quid esset
He wanted one.	Voluit unus.
Now tell me.	Nunc autem dic mihi.
She told me everything.	Omnia mihi indicavit.
I know a lot of it at home.	Multum ex eo domi scio.
None of it can be seen.	Nemo ex eo videri potest.
Now I can see him coming	Iam possum videre eum venire
It was not enough.	Parum fuit.
That makes me very happy.	Ut me sit amet ipsum.
If he does, well.	Si facit, bene.
It was so.	Sic erat.
This is certainly possible.	Hoc certe fieri potest.
I only want to be true	Tantum volo verum
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum est.
He was a man.	homo erat.
i'm not enough.	parum sum.
He does not do.	Non facit.
He made no friends.	Amicos non fecit.
I feel good but not up to me.	Bene sentio, sed non usque ad me.
I can't say what to do	Non possum dicere quid facere
I still don't know what he's talking about.	Adhuc nescio quid loquitur.
We can only do so much.	Tantum possumus tantum facere.
forgot everything about it.	Oblitus est omnia de illa.
I can't believe it's done	Non possum credere factum est
But let's be honest how he was.	Sed sit amet quam erat.
I did not know this.	Hic nesciebam.
I hope that somebody speaks his name	Spero autem quod quis loquitur nomen suum
I can't believe I did this	Non possum credere me hoc fecit
He was already there.	Iam illum.
He was out of it.	Erat ex.
He doesn't have to talk.	Loqui non habet.
never met him.	numquam ei occurrit.
Work done at a given time.	Opus certo tempore fecisse.
He was a father, but gave him nothing.	Pater erat, sed nihil ei dedit.
I didn't know this	Haec ego nesciebam
I didn't want to be seen	nolui videri
But what he wanted, there was one who did not want him.	Sed quod vellet, erat qui eum nolebat.
.	.
It has been a long time since.	Ex eo iam diu fuit.
Well, who is not, he asked.	Bene, qui non est, rogavit.
He had no idea how to act.	Se agere nesciebat.
i'm good enough about that.	satis sum de illo.
After that I have something	Post hoc habeo aliquid
But he also himself.	Sed et ipsum quam.
I won't do that to her again	Non faciam ut sibi iterum
I knew only time	Sciebam tantum tempus
I'll say it again.	Dicam iterum.
I could not see myself like this.	Non potui me videre sic.
That's a great thing.	Ut a magna est.
I know you can't see	Scio te videre non potes
No time for that story.	Aliquam id tempus nulla.
I totally forgot that	Prorsus oblitus sum quod
I'm at my job	Ego ad officium meum
Her father is looking.	Pater suus vultus est.
It is not.	Non est.
Don't say anything else.	Noli aliud dicere.
He speaks and speaks and speaks.	Loquitur et loquitur et loquitur.
It is difficult, but possible.	Difficile est, sed fieri potest.
Don't come here for fun	Non huc ut amet
It probably isn't.	Probabile ne est.
I could not leave you alone	Te solum non potui relinquere
You don't get what you want.	Non te quod vis.
And that was difficult.	Quod et difficile erat.
Now this is certain.	Nunc id certum est.
I need help from you all	Opus auxilium a te omnia
No one knew anything.	Nemo aliquid scivit.
I thought it was going to be time for me.	Tempus futurum putavi, ut esset mihi.
I could not do it	Non potui facere ei
Maybe they are.	Forsitan sunt.
I didn't know that until	Ego nesciebam eo usque
You should not.	Non debes.
I know better than	Scio melius quam
I need to talk with him.	Mihi necesse est cum eo loqui.
I'm not sure how to say	Non certus sum quomodo dicere
that is the plan.	id est consilium.
I don't even know.	Non novi quidem.
that is the thing.	id est rem.
I need someone who can do it well	Opus est aliquis qui possit facere bene
I was	Eram, modo
I feel like no one loves me	Sentio ut nemo me amat
I generally don't do anything	Ego fere non aliquid
I thought you understand	Cogitavi te intelligere
Until dinner is likely.	Usque ad cenam, verisimile est.
I won't be so	Ego non ita esse,
I couldn't stop doing it	Non potui facere prohibere
never been there.	numquam ibi.
I knew it could not be done	Sciebam fieri non posse
I thought of my plan	Cogitavi meum consilium
To know that he could do anything.	Scire se posse aliquid.
Nothing will stop it	Nihil sum prohibere eam
I hope the same for you.	Idem tibi spero.
I am not happy at all	Non sum felix omnino
But that was what it was.	Sed id erat erat.
I also do the same	Ego quoque idem facere
This is enough.	Hoc satis est.
I have done what I have done	Feci quod fieri
now I see.	nunc video.
I am not going home.	Non domum.
The matter is with you.	Rem tecum.
Can't speak to him.	Non potest ei dicere.
I thought what this meant	Cogitavi quid hoc esset
And don't talk again	Et iterum non loqui
often not.	Saepe non est.
You think you are.	Putas te esse.
She didn't expect it.	Illa non putabat.
Look no further here either.	Nihil hic vide vel.
I was the one who always was	Fui qui semper erat
But he is gone.	Sed abiit.
We cannot go through this.	Per hoc ire non possumus.
You know us.	Scis nos.
He did not.	Non fecit.
I didn't want to think more	Nolui cogitare amplius
But this is not true.	Hoc autem non est verum.
You are here.	Hic es.
I saw and did	Vidi, et fecit
My job has been done.	Meum officium factum est.
I want her to have it	Volo eam habere eam
This was similar.	Hoc erat simile.
Yes we also.	Ita nos etiam.
I know by him and by him.	per ipsum et per scio.
I just want home and dinner	Ego iustus volo domum et cenam
He refused to give it to him.	Eum dare noluisse id.
I didn't think it was enough.	Non putavi satis esse.
I want him to live and speak	Volo eum vivere et loqui
I believe we really look so much more	Credo nos vere multo plus esse
You are right by.	Tu recte ab.
There was none.	Nulla erat.
It was early but not sure.	Mane sed certus erat.
I think you're doing well.	Puto te bene facere.
But there was not any.	Sed non aliquam erat.
I told her that too	Dixi ei ut nimis
I can't do anything about this	Non possum aliquid de hoc
I like him, you know.	ego eum, tu scis.
I was alone nothing	solus eram nihil
Maybe I should help you.	Forsitan ut te adiuvet.
I too thought to be a boy	Ego quoque putavit esse puer
I did not know.	Nesciebam.
I know what this is now	Scio quid hoc nunc est
I love you all	Amo te omnia
there he did it again.	ibi iterum fecit.
I think it's all up to you in the morning	Hoc puto omnes usque ad mane
I couldn't talk anything	Non potui loqui aliquid
I'm glad he was here.	Gaudeo eum hic fuisse.
We cannot do this.	Hoc facere non possumus.
I didn't want her to stop me	Et noluit eam prohibere me
It was so, he thought.	Sic erat, putabat.
I definitely think I need some time	Ego certus puto opus aliquo tempore
To live is good.	Vivere bonum est.
I thought I could do a lot of things.	Putavi multum posse.
I said I don't like it.	Dictum eius non amo.
I heard him say my name after me	Audivi eum dicere nomen meum post me
and	et.
I didn't know you were there	Ego nesciebam es ibi
It's not so hard for me.	Mihi non ita est.
That was it.	Erat id.
Play as much as you can.	Ludere quod potes.
We have a lot of things	Multum nobis sunt
I won't be here much longer	Hic ego non multo diutius
This is certain.	Hoc certum est.
I can't do that now	Non possum facere quod nunc
It is very, very good.	Valde valde est.
I was there too.	Ibi etiam eram.
I really owe you one	Ego vere debere tibi unum
It's good to have it.	Bonum est habere illud.
Plus, it's just a bad deal.	Plus, mali tantum est fac.

That was mine.	Quod erat meum.
Who is so?	Quis ita.
No one is doing it.	Nulla quis enim id facere.
And finally he saw something.	Et tandem aliquid vidit.

That's no longer a problem.	Id iam non est quaestio.

I know you more	Scio te amplius

They don't do anything.	Non sunt aliquid.
All things always.	Omnia semper.
You never forgot what you told me	Numquam oblitus es quod non indicavit mihi

I don't want to go that way.	Nolo illuc ire.
I will not do this now.	Non iam hoc faciam.
I need to know what happened	Mihi opus est scire quid factum est
I was after him	Post eum essem

I thought you were	Ut putabam te

I like to buy for you	Mihi placet emere pro vobis

This is very bad for me.	Valde mihi malum hoc est.
I don't like with him	Et non sicut cum eo
I just feel bad about it	Ego iustus sentio de hoc malum
I don't quite know whether it's good or not.	Non satis scio utrum bonum sit necne.
I am sure how long.	Certus sum quam diu.
i think i can probably hear it	Puto eam probabiliter potest audire
I knew all this	Sciebam hoc totum
I just thought you'd like me to talk to her	Ego iustus cogitavi velis me loqui eius
I just need to say great	Ego iustus opus est dicere magna
You are mine and my only.	Meus es, et solus meus.
He did not know whether what was true.	Utrum quid verum esset, nesciebat.
I do as I said quickly.	Cito facio ut dixi.
No time for that.	Id tempus, nulla.
I can't say the truth	Non possum dicere verum
Don't think this way.	Noli hoc modo cogitare.
Which was true.	Quod verum erat.
It is not so with you.	Non ita est apud vos.
can still do something.	adhuc aliquid facere potest.
I couldn't totally tell him no	Non potui prorsus dicere ei non
Yes it is important that.	Etiam sit amet quam.
This is exactly the same.	Hoc prorsus idem est.
A man cannot accept.	Non potest homo accipere.
It has not.	Sic non habet.
As well as someone	Ut etiam cum aliquo
Maybe he did it.	Forsitan id fecit.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
He comes to him.	Venit ad se.
The situation is the same.	Sic se habet.
I could not discuss it	Non potui ei de
I don't do well.	Non bene facere.
He doesn't want to say.	Non vult dicere.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum enim.
I knew that would never be possible	Sciebam quod nunquam fieri potest
I just want to make sure you do well	EGO iustus volo facio certus vos bene
Please do the same.	Idem quaeso.
He was not.	Non erat.
I didn't do this at the time	Non feci hoc tempore
But he does this.	Hoc tamen facit.
You can't know.	Scire non potes.
I am still alive.	adhuc sum.
This is what I wanted for you	Hoc volui quod tibi
But that's not working right now.	Sed id nunc non est opus.
I have seen you.	Vidi te.
I tried to talk her out of it	Conatus sum loqui eam ex eo
Now I feel very pleased.	Nunc admodum sentio.
sorry about that.	quod me paenitet.
But it was not the same.	Sed non ipsum erat.
Now he wants to do it himself.	Nunc id ipsum velit.
Here's the question.	Hic est quaestio.
I am sure it is a matter of money	Ego certe est res pecuniae
as i see you.	sicut ego te.
I want to see you all	Volo videre omnes vos
He could do it again.	Potuit iterum facere.
I just want you to feel it.	EGO iustus volo vos sentio.
I'm sure you could think of something.	Certus sum te aliquid de me posse cogitare.
He likes to believe, but not.	Velit credere, sed non.
He didn't say anything, time.	Non aliquid dixit, tempus.
Nor does he know you.	Nec te novit.
I don't go to school	Ego ne ad scholam
No one is seen.	Nemo videtur.
I can't know what's going to happen	Non possum scire quid sit futurum
You did not do this.	Hoc facere non fecisti.
I didn't want to talk anymore.	Nolui loqui amplius.
I am getting used to it	Questus sum ad eam
He had to do it himself.	Facere eum erat ipsum.
I can't go on this longer	Non possum hoc diutius ire
You only do.	Tu tantum fac.
I have something to say to you both	Habeo tibi aliquid dicere utrumque
I tried but not working	Conatus sum, sed non opus
It was easy for the boy to speak.	Facile erat puer loqui.
I am also completely everything	Ego sum etiam omnino omnia
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
Never before all	Nunquam ante omnia
You know what you need	Quid tu scis opus
never did.	nunquam fecit.
But that is.	Sed id est est.
I could not get enough	Non potui satis
I didn't know about it until late	Ego nesciebam de eo usque ad sero
But he wanted his house and car.	Sed domum suam et currus voluit.
But not here.	Sed ne hic.
But something is good.	Sed bonum est aliquid.
As stated above.	Sicut dictum est.
Nothing else	Nihil aliud
he wished to do his journey without me.	sine me voluit iter suum facere.
Let's do it.	Sit id.
Would that my father were here.	Utinam pater hic esset.
There was one guy.	Erat unus guy.
I don't think you just met.	Non videtur tibi sicut occurrit.
You are just.	Tu iustus es.
I've never met this way.	Hoc modo mihi nunquam occurrit.

I could go through this with someone	Non potui ire per hoc cum aliquis
not something	Non aliquid

it's just your room.	sicut cubiculum tuum est.
He knew how he could do this.	Hoc facere potuit, scivit quomodo.
That's a very happy statement.	Ut sit amet dictum ipsum.
I think today is a good day	Puto hodie est bona dies
And it was not true.	Et non fuit verum.
But it's not too late.	Sed non sero est.
i am really happy	Ego vere felix
I'm glad.	Gaudeo.
I just think you need to know that	Ego iustus cogitare debes scire quod
I didn't know what to do	Quid facturus esset, nesciebam
I tried to think and act as I wanted	Conatus sum cogitare et agere sicut voluit
He chooses not to.	Velit non.
Now there is none.	Nunc non est.
May it be.	Sit esse.
I haven't had the whole time	Totum tempus non habui
Bad thing I wanted	Malum est volui
What a good day.	Quam bonus est dies.
I saw the money again	Vidi adhuc pecuniam
This was never just about him.	Hoc solum de illo numquam fuit.
I know you're here.	Scio te hic esse.
He wants to do just as he wills	Hoc vult facere sicut vult, sed
I have done these things to him.	Haec ei feci.
I could not do what I wanted	Potui non facere quod voluit
We don't need it.	Non opus est nobis.
Gone quickly	Abiit cito
I can do this all day like there is nothing	Hoc facere possum totum diem sicut non est nihil
This is just home.	Hoc modo domum.
It is difficult.	Difficile est.
I can't believe that this is	Non possum credere quod hoc est
I almost told her what it is	Ego fere ei quod est
You know how.	Scis quomodo.
They are here to stay.	Quae hic manere.
I am still in it as a person	Ego tamen in eo ut homo
This is true, unless it is sufficiently true.	Hoc verum est, nisi satis verum est.
No, my love.	Non, mea.
I just can't do anything	Ego iustus potest aliquid facere
That's her name.	Id ei nomen.
But he thought this time was different.	Sed hoc tempus aliud esse putavit.
I know him too well	Scio eum nimium bene
Certainly if it was, I can't say it.	Certe si fuit, non possum dicere.
We are not to do so.	Non sumus id.
Something I need to say.	Aliquid opus est dicere.
There should always be	Non debet semper esse
I don't need to have.	Non opus est habere.
You can never do enough.	Numquam satis facere potes.
Certainly today is not a day.	Certe hodie non est dies.
I had to buy something else.	Habui aliquid aliud emere.
I just know they are not together	Modo scire non sunt simul
Nothing I can do.	Nihil possum facere.
I just can't buy that	Ego iustus potest emere quod

For it was great.	Erat enim magna.
I could not help us	Non potui non adiuvare nos
I can't find him	Non possum invenire eum
That's what he did here.	Id quod hic fecit.
I never thought I would do anything like that	Numquam putavi se aliquid simile esse facturum
Look for one more.	Plus unum vide.
I really like this post	Ego vere similis post haec

You made yourself again.	Fecisti te iterum.
And that was done.	Id autem factum est.

Don't say you don't.	Noli dicere non facis.
I really don't feel good.	Ego vere non bene sentio.
It was still time.	Adhuc erat tempus.
But you don't need to go into it now.	Sed non nunc necesse est ire in illud.
But I can't do that.	Sed ut facere non possum.
I wonder if you have something for me	Miror si aliquid mihi

It's like something else.	Aliud est simile.
I know who you really are	Scio qui vere es
I could not believe it.	Non potui credere illum esse.
I hope to get us through it	Spero fore ut nos per illum

I'm going a lot.	Ego multum eat.
What should he do?	Quid faceret?.
I really thought to see him	Ego vere putavit se videre
And so it ought to be.	Et sic debet.

What we are.	Quod sumus.
I think you could say something like this.	Puto te aliquid simile hoc dicere posse.
I just feel like we're not alone	Ego iustus placet sumus non solum
I just don't believe what happened	Ego iustus non credere quod factum est
I know that I'm trying to do something	Scio quod conatur ad me aliquid

I believe what you did	Ego credere quod fecit
That's it for some.	Ut id aliquam est.
I hope everybody wants to be	Spero omnes vult esse
which I could not.	quod non potui.
I didn't know what it could be	Ego nesciebam quid de illo esse possit
This is I know you know	Hoc est novi te novi

I feel better just to say all the great	Sentio melius modo dicere omnes magna
Well, you're not getting through me.	Bene, per me non es questus.
I really want a father here	Ego vere volo pater hic
I didn't	Non feci eum
I had not.	non habui.
But it is not null.	Sed non nulla est.
I didn't know what at the time	Nesciebam quid hoc tempore
I don't know what you really want.	Nescio quid vere.
But that's none of it.	Sed id ex nulla.
I would do it myself.	Ego ipse facerem.
I am not talking about this.	Non de hoc.
Maybe not anymore, not as you used to.	Forsitan non amplius, non ut solebat.
I tried, I tried on him	Conatus sum conatus in eo

I will do a lot	Multum faciam
It was not enough.	Parum fuit.
The problem is, there will be no more.	Quaestio est, non erit amplius.
Which one is up to you.	Quod quidem est ad vos.
Without a job.	Sine officium.
But it is not so.	Sed non ita est.
May be now.	Sit ut nunc.
but he knew better.	sed melius sciebat.
It's just your business.	Suus 'iustus tibi res est.
If there is any	Si quis est.
I think I can do this	Puto me hoc facere possum
But here it is.	Sed hic est.
I'm ready in the morning	Paratus sum in aliquo mane

I just can't get enough of it	Ego iustus non potest satis ab eo

This is the future, and we are in it.	Hoc est futurum, et sumus in eo.
Perhaps he is himself.	Forsitan et ipse.

This one.	Hoc unum.

You need it.	Debes illud.
So it is.	Ita est.

Everything is too little, too late.	Omnia parum, nimium sero.
I knew nothing about him	Nihil sciebam de eo
I can do it, you know	Possum facere, tu scis
I would like to be someone	Vellem aliquis esse
I have so much to do	Habeo tantum facere
So perhaps it's not a problem for you.	Ita fortasse quaestio non est tibi.
I'm not so sure	Non ita est certus sum
After ex.	Post ex.
and nothing is wrong.	et nihil est mali.
not before anyone.	Non ante quis.

I knew there was something in you	Sciebam esse aliquid in te
That speaks to you.	Quod loquitur ad vos.
Talk to someone.	Loqui cum aliquo.
But this was not so.	Sed hoc non erat ita.

I am thinking about you	Ego sum cogitas te

He came again.	Iterum venit.
You can do it tonight.	Nocte id facere potes.
Right, to think, to think.	Recte, cogitare, cogitare.
I could go to my room	Ire potui ad cubiculum meum
You don't want to act	Non vis agere
But this is another thing.	Sed hoc aliud.
If anyone could help me, he could.	Si quis me adiuvare posset, posset.
I tried one	Conatus sum unum
It was me.	Me erat.
Even not like yourself.	Etiam non ut ipsum.
I believe what you say	Credo quod dicit

I just am in it today	Ego iustus sum in eo hodie
I just don't want a problem.	Non solum non vis quaestio.
That she did.	Id fecit.

It really is still up.	Is vere est usque adhuc.
This has not been done.	Hoc non est factum.
I didn't know what to say	Ego nesciebam quid dicam

One with me.	Una mecum.
Well, he thought.	Bene, putabat.
I can't say why now	Non possum dicere quare nunc
Unless it is.	Nisi id est.
It is probable why.	Probabile est quare.
I have a lot of work to do	Ego multum opus facere
Not all to you.	Non omnes ad te.
So you have nothing.	Sic nihil habes.
I wish things weren't so	Utinam res non sic
He did, however.	Fecit tamen.
I think that's true	Puto quod verum est
for a long time already.	iam diu.
I went to work	Dixi ad opus
I have nothing to do	Ego nihil ad rem
But it is well.	Sed bene est.
He ought to speak.	Dicere debet.
Want to know a little more?	Visne paulo plus scire?

I know he wants to help.	Scio eum adiuvare velle.
That where it was said by me.	Quod ubi a me dictum sit.

Well almost none.	Bene fere nulla.
I am not sure.	Non sum certus.
You must do this	Hoc facere debet
I've been on a date with him	Fui hoc in diem cum eo

Not for you.	Non tibi.
Not sure if it's true.	Non certe si verum est.
he gave it well.	ei bene dedit.
I wanted to know who he was	Scire volui quis esset
This is my name.	Hoc est nomen meum.

You are not right.	Non recte.
He knew how hard it was to do.	Scivit quam difficile esset facere.
Yes, it was not.	Etiam non erat.
That's pretty certain.	Id satis certum est.
I can't believe it is gone	Non possum credere quod abiit
I wish this would not be	Utinam hoc non esset
It is indeed.	Est quidem.
I can't go through this	Non possum ire per hoc
You only do.	Tu tantum fac.
For he knew.	Sciebat enim.
But yes, there was more than that.	Etiam sed erat quam.
He did not know what it was.	Nesciebat quid esset.
Yes it is so it is.	Ita est sic est.
I am sure of that.	Certus sum de illo.
I have heard.	Audivi.
I get what you say	Ego id quod dicit
And rightly so.	Et recte.
She was also pretty good.	Satis bona erat etiam illa.
He could not say enough.	Non potuit satis dicere.
You can do this indeed.	Hoc quidem facere potes.
when the problem is fixed.	Cum certum est quaestio.
I don't know his name	Ego non scio nomen suum
Something bad is bad.	Aliquid malum malum.
I'm afraid I'm really soon	Vereor me vere primum
Now she has.	Nunc habet.
He gave it to her.	Dedit ad eam.
Don't help me yet.	Ne me adiuvet adhuc.
But that is the whole.	Sed id est totum.
i've never seen anything quite like it before	numquam vidi quicquam satis simile ante
I never wanted you to do something like this	Numquam volui tibi aliquid simile hoc fieri
I know you don't exist.	Scio te non esse.
I know that there is something from him	Scio quod non sit aliquid ab eo
I could not do this anymore	Non potui hoc amplius
I can stay hard with you	Multa possum manere difficile apud te
Your work is fine too.	Tibi quoque bene sit opus.
I think too often.	Puto nimis saepe.
I wasn't you	Non eram tibi
I just didn't want to believe	Ego iustus noluit credere
That's enough.	Ita satis.
I could not even hear him rightly	Ne quidem recte eum audire potui
Well, we have three options.	Bene, tres bene habemus.
I was ready for him	Paratus eram ei
And at least you'd like to see.	Et certe videre velis.
I am not surprised that	Non miror quod
I am getting better at it	Questus sum in eo melius
I'm sorry, we can do nothing.	Me paenitet, nihil possumus.
I think stay friends	Puto manere amicos
I can't do this, no problem	Hoc facere non possum, nulla quaestio
What is? 	Quid est?
he said.	dixit.
i haven't seen you lately.	nuper non vidi.
Only this one	Tantum hoc unum
I have seen too much.	Vidi nimis.
But it was not said.	Sed non dictum ipsum.
Yes it is, so you are.	Ita est, sic es.
Finally something came to her.	Tandem aliquid ad eam venit.
No one could see the matter.	Nemo rem videre potuit.
I can't think that way	Non possum cogitare illuc
But make sure that you do.	Sed fac ut facias.
And well indeed.	Et bene quidem.
He said I'd like to talk.	Dixit me velis dicere.
I'm single and nothing else.	Im unum, et nihil aliud.
I knew I was always me	Sciebam me semper me esse
You can do nothing else.	Nihil aliud potes.
And it was true.	Et verum fuit.
I don't know what's in it.	Quid in eo sit nescio.
How well it is for you.	Ut bene sit tibi.
If you want to.	Si vis.
If he could not do it, he would do nothing.	Si non posset facere, nihil faceret.
I can't stop myself.	Ego me prohibere possum.
I always wanted to have	Me semper habere volui
i think great, yes	Puto magna, etiam
I could not go	Non potui ire
Would that it was not so.	Utinam non ita esset.
I just would like to help her	Ego tantum vellem auxilium eius
I didn't want to go and said	Nolui ire et dixit
I knew this must come	Haec sciebam venire necesse est
So that's one.	Ita ut 'unum'.
But it was always fun.	Sed semper sit amet erat.
I was her, it was mine	Eius eram, mea erat
i think i really don't regret what i did	Puto vere non paenitet quod fecit
I can't help you so I want	Non possum tibi sic volo
not long something	Non diu aliquid
So it's very good.	Sic ipsum bonum est.
I doubt you ever want to see me again	Dubito te semper vis videre iterum me
That's too hard to do.	Quod nimis difficile est facere.
You can find them all here.	Omnes hic invenire potes.
I couldn't see you go	Non potui videri te ire
I've done mine.	Ego feci meum.
I want to help this	Hoc volo auxilium
I don't want, never again	Nolo, numquam iterum
That's what they are.	Id sunt enim.
I'm lucky enough to be	Sum satis felix esse
I only do it with you	Tantum faciam tecum
I can still see it like mine	Non possum tamen videre eam sicut meus
I am only here to help you	Ego solus hic ad auxilium te
Not much to do	Non multum ad facere
I think it could be	Puto esse non potuit
But now before.	Sed iam ante.
I don't want to be seen anymore.	Non iam vis videri.
Make yourself at home.	Domi ipsum fac.
It could have been later.	Potuit post fuisse.
I wish everything was so easy	Ego vellem omnia tam facile
I just want to do it	Ego iustus volo facere
And what he looks at today.	Et quod hodie spectat.
it was what it was.	fuit quod fuit.
I know you've got something	Scio te obtinuit aliquid
This is to be not something or something.	Hoc est esse non est aliquid vel aliquid.
You and me both.	Tu et me utrumque.
I know you're not easy	Scio tibi non facile
But not before.	Sed non ante.
I can't talk anymore	Non possum dicere amplius
As he did.	Sicut fecit.
I am all and not of him	Ego sum omnes et non ex eo
I want them all.	Volo omnes.
This he willed, and he himself willed to give it to himself.	Hoc voluit, et ipse voluit sibi dare.
I never heard it before.	Numquam ante id audivi.
I hope the same about me	Spero simile de me
I don't do anything to you	Non aliquid tibi
I like someone.	Mihi placet aliquis.
I can't say what you did with him	Non possum dicere quid fecit cum eo
I hope at least you can.	Spero certe potes.
I need to be my boyfriend	Mihi opus est ut meum,
But today it is not.	Sed hodie non est.
and this is still true.	et hoc adhuc verum est.
I could not be so happy	Non potui tam felix
And I believe I would do it.	Et me facturum credo.
I could see him home	Non potui videre eum in domum suam
I wonder what this was all about	Miror quid hoc esset de omnibus
I love this look so much	Hoc tantum amo vultus
I tried quickly	Conatus sum cito
I couldn't believe it	Non potui credere eam
he had a plan.	consilium habuit.
Not much time	Non multum temporis
That she did.	Id fecit.
There was always something else about it	Non semper aliquid aliud fuit de eo
If so where.	Si ita ubi.
For this is not to be done	Non enim hoc fieri
I am not alone	Non sum solus
To be with you	Ut sit tibi sum

I want help.	Auxilium volo.
I hope that's true.	Spero quod verum est.
Not all.	Non omnes.
It's already time to think about this.	Est iam hoc cogitare.
That can't be too bad, can't it be?	Quod nimis malum esse non potest, potest?
I can't believe you at the moment	Non possum credere te in tempore
It probably isn't the best.	Probabile non optime.
Never do	Numquam facere

I think I've realized that	Intellexit puto me esse
I don't have a chance	Non habere forte

I hope a lot of that is well	Spero multum, quod bene

I can not.	Non possum.
That's really only.	Id solum vere.
I think I can do this	Puto hoc facere non posse
Is he a man like a man?	Estne homo ut homo.
I didn't know everything	Ego nesciebam omnia
That was the first time.	Quod primum fuit.
I can never tell you how much.	Numquam tibi dicere possum quantum.
That's how it is.	Id ut est.
I don't want to know we've seen him.	Nolo eum scire nos vidi.
I am lucky to live	Ego felix vivere
That's not so.	Quod non sic.
Do you want with me?	Visne mecum?.
I didn't know that your name was real.	Nesciebam id nomen tuum verum esse.
I am here for you.	Hic ego sum vobis.
We need to know.	Scire nobis opus est.

I also like to help e	Ego quoque amo ut adiuvet e

Do not speak thus.	Noli ita loqui.
I don't know what you did	Nescio quid fecerit
Or not the same.	Vel non ipsum.
Really got to go.	Vere obtinuit ut.
It is not possible, however, by itself.	Non potest tamen per se ipsum.
Looks like he was good.	Similis erat eum bona.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
I really don't want to know.	Ego vere scire non vis.
Time was enough.	Tempus erat satis.
He does nothing today.	Nihil hodie ex eo facit.
I'm not sure if this is true or not.	Non sum certus si hoc sit vel non.

I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
I can help you there	Non possum adiuvare vos ibi

I didn't know anyone there	Ego nesciebam quis ibi
I could say yes to you	Etiam dicere potui tibi
I was lucky to stay in	Felix fui in me manere
I saw it and saw the time	Vidi illum et vidi tempus
You have already done all that you can.	Iam fecisti omnia quae potes.
Only concern.	Tantum spectat.
Nothing is to be seen.	Nihil est ut videtur.
I like or no.	Ut vel velit nulla.
I haven't seen both of you	Non vidi utrumque cum

I have seen nothing but him and him not always	nihil vidi nisi eum, et ipsum non semper
I wonder what's coming	Miror quid venit
I hope so, father.	Spero te ita, pater.
We can't do that.	Quod facere non possumus.
It's you.	Est tibi.
But to know is not enough.	Sed scire non est satis.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
Always see you	Semper te videre
He does so.	Ita facit.
i thought i would be	Putabam ut esset
It's not his job to know.	Non suum officium est scire.
you must come to me.	ad me venire debes.
How fun to get there.	Et quomodo illuc amet.
This certainly does.	Hoc certe facit.
.	.
Not a day.	Non dies.
This says a lot.	Hoc dicit multum.
Maybe he should.	Fortasse debet.
I believe in this or that	Credo in hoc vel illud
I just wasn't sure what to do	Ego iustus non certus quid de hoc facere
Many things to be done	Multa fieri
I know him pretty	Scio eum satis
You know it's not.	Scis non est.
We certainly don't think so.	Nos certe non puto.
Yes, he had a wife.	Ita est, uxorem habuit.
Maybe he had.	Fortasse habuit.
I am so happy to have him.	Tam felix sum ut illum.
I can't anymore	Non possum amplius
I don't know what that	Nescio quid illa
if you know, you know.	si scis, scis.
I choose not to do this	Libet ne hoc
In this way I thought it would be too	Hoc quoque modo futurum esse putabam
i think i would love her	Puto eum ut amo eam
I didn't need it but wanted it.	Non opus est ut sed eam voluit.
I must say it first	Debeo dicere primum
I can't get it.	Id habere non possum.
But that's not even enough.	Sed ne id quidem satis.
Maybe you should.	Forsitan ut.
I choose, boy.	Libet, puer.
And now I'm in.	Et nunc sum in.
You're OK with that.	Bene ab illo es.
I know you understand	Scio te intelligere
I didn't know anything to tell you.	Ego nesciebam nihil tibi dicere.
But perhaps	Sed fortasse.
Certainly if you can still live.	Certe si adhuc vivere potes.
No, better.	Non, melius.
I could find you soon enough if you need it	Te satis cito invenire potui, si opus sit

Most likely it will be.	Verisimile erit.
it was from.	fuit ab.
The situation is as follows.	Res ita se habet.
I don't know what she's talking about	Nescio quid illa loquitur
A little too much to think	Paulo nimium, ut videtur
I hope work is for you	Spero opus est tibi
I just never married	Ego iustus numquam uxorem
But not at all.	Sed non nulla.
I haven't even seen it yet	Ego ne vidi quidem adhuc
The work does not work per se.	Opus non facit per se.
I don't want to do anything else.	Nolo aliud facere.
Maybe it's not.	Aliquam non est.
That, he thinks.	Id, putat.
Stop this now for me	Hoc nunc ad me prohibere
I am good enough for the week	Ego satis pro septimana
I was lucky for him	Felix fui pro eo
I never had one before	Numquam habuit unum ante
But I see it now	Verum eam nunc video
Well generally.	Bene fere.
Everything as you said.	Omnia sicut dixisti.
I didn't know it was a long time	Nesciebam quod diu fuit
You make us to be there.	Tu nos fac ibi esse.
I can do it if you want to be	Possum facere si vis fieri
This was true.	Hoc verum erat.
That's gonna be great.	Ut sit amet magna.
He's been pretty much the past.	Vir fere multo ante est.
And he saw there.	Et vidit ibi.
He wants to be himself.	Ut et ipsum velit.
Can you tell me this.	Dic mihi hoc posse.
But he did not do this.	Sed hoc non fecit.
Now I have to do this	Nunc habeo hoc facere
Now I can't come, not today	Nunc venire non possum, non hodie
I tried and tried but didn't talk to me	Conatus sum et conatus sed non loqui ad me
I saw her face	Vidi vultus eius
I truly believe that.	Vere credo.
Maybe that would be good for us.	Forsitan id nobis bonum esset.
It is good.	Bonum est.
I didn't want this to ever stop	Nolui hoc semper prohibere
If there is room, we have it.	Si cubiculum est, habemus illud.
But not nearly enough.	Sed non fere satis.
Nothing has been done yet.	Nihil tamen hoc factum est.
That's very important to be honest.	Ut sit amet magna ipsum.
I hope you had a great time.	Spero autem et tempus magna.
Or who to do so.	Vel quis id.
This is my everything	Hoc mihi omnia
Not all is well with you.	Non omnia bene sunt tibi.
He willed.	Voluit.
He even wants to get some.	Etiam ut aliquam velit.
But that's all for.	Sed id omnes ad.
I think it is probable.	Probabile puto.
I don't know how things	Nescio quomodo res
I never did time.	Numquam feci tempus.
I can't talk about it	Non possum dicere de illo
He wanted to know who the man was.	Scire voluit quis homo esset.
It cannot be true.	Verum esse non potest.
Never used anything	Nunquam solebat aliquid
This is something.	Hoc est aliquid.
I need to know more about it	Mihi opus est scire de eo
It was what it was.	Erat quid erat.
I think I can do this in an easy way	Hoc facile modo facere posse puto
I could not find it	Non potui invenire eam
Nothing is better.	Nihil melius.
I was like there last night	Fui sicut ibi nocte
I couldn't see it yet	Non potui videre eam adhuc
I want to understand help	Volo intelligere auxilium
He does the job.	Facit officium.
To be very happy.	Ut sit amet quam ipsum.
Maybe just post it again.	Forsitan mox post illud iterum.
I guess something was good.	Suspicor quid esset bonum.
I am so sorry this happened to you	Ita sum paenitet hoc factum est tibi
I think I need to hear	Puto opus me audire
I just can't buy that	Ego iustus potest emere quod
One time only.	Unum tempus nisi.
sorry too much.	nimium me paenitet.
I try my best to live up to my name	Ego meum ad vivere usque ad nomen meum
I heard what	Audivi quid
I can't say enough sure what to say	Dicere non possum satis certo quid dicam
I was someone in there with me.	Fui aliquem in ibi mecum.
I knew what it was	Sciebam quid esset
I know what you think	Scio quid cogitat
I just can't believe that's true	Ego iustus potest credere quod verum sit
I think you can see what I can do.	Videre te puto quid facere possit.
Only evil.	Tantum malum.
So it is.	Ita est.
I can't let anyone stop me	Non possum ne quis me prohibere
I'll make you dinner	Faciam te cenam
And see what.	Et vide quid.
I could not tell you.	Non potui tibi dicere.
But you alone could do it.	Sed tu solus id potuit.
I can't say this enough	Hoc satis non possum dicere
Maybe it was great.	Aliquam erat magna.
Soon to e	Mox ut e
The situation is the same.	Ita res se habet.
I'm happy if it is so.	gaudeo si ita est.
But that's not the problem.	Id autem non est quaestio.
He was there, but could only see.	Ibi erat, sed modo videre non potuit.
Not yet thirty.	Nondum triginta.
He saw evil.	Vidit malum.
I didn't know much about it	Ego nesciebam nimis de eo
But that was done.	Sed id factum est.
I don't know how to come through.	Nescio quomodo per.
nor did I know what was too much, nor what was too little.	nec quid nimis esset, nec quid parum sciebam.
It is not for us.	Non est nobis.
I could think of a little something else for a long time	Aliud diu potui cogitare parum
That really started to do something.	Quod vere incepit aliquid.
I almost feel pretty right again	Ego fere sentio satis recte iterum
I wanted to go.	ire volui.
Now that's what it was.	Nunc ut quam erat.
I thought he would understand	Cogitavi se intelligere
Hard time to find.	Tempus invenire difficile.
I'll make it up to you somehow	Faciam eum ad vos aliquo modo
It was good for him.	Bene erat ei.
don't make it here	Non eam huc
I won't tell you.	Ego non dicam tibi.
I hope you can understand that	Spero te posse intelligere quod
Perhaps he was finally ready to receive help.	Fortasse tandem paratus erat ei auxilium accipere.
Now what's happened.	Nunc quid acciderit.
I couldn't believe this happened to me	Hoc mihi fieri non potui credere
I do not doubt.	Non dubito.
This morning	Hoc mane.
I think a lot of things	Ego multum cogitare de
At least I did both.	Certe utrumque feci.
I know him very well indeed	Scio eum optime quidem
It is possible to go again.	Fieri potest ut iterum.
I can't do anything like that	Non possum facere quicquam simile quod
I know that he wants to say that	Scio se velle dicere se
I did exactly what he said to me	Ego feci prorsus quod dixit ad me
I thought he could not	Cogitavi se non posse
I just find me	Ego iustus invenire me
The same thing here.	Idem hic.
I know what you mean	Scio quid vis
I hope too	Spero nimis.
Don't leave again.	Noli iterum relinquere.
There's nothing wrong with that.	Nihil mali de illa.
But we can't do it without you.	Sed id sine te facere non possumus.
I still don't talk about it	Ego tamen non loqui de illo
It is not so.	Non ita est.
I can't say the same thing boy	Non possum dicere quod idem puer
This is how he speaks to me right now.	Hoc modo mihi nunc loquitur.
My father is like me.	Pater mihi similis est.
I hope you didn't	Spero eam non fecisti
I wanted this too, but not only	Id quoque volui, sed non modo
I don't regret what I don't regret.	Non paenitet te quae non paenitet.
Good to be here.	Bene hic esse.
Well, now you're mine.	Bene, nunc meus es.
No it's already there.	Nulla iam est.
That's the time for that one.	Id tempus quis.
I wanted to live there.	Ibi vivere volui.
I could not believe	Non potui credere
He could not do this.	Hoc facere non potuit.
I don't really like him	Non vere similis ei
I am not sure why	adhuc certum non habeo quare
Yes it is.	Ita sit.
But we are also men.	Sed etiam homines sumus.
I don't want this anymore	Nolo hoc amplius
I don't know if it's true.	Nescio si verum est.
I didn't know before	Ego nesciebam ante
I looked better	Vidi melius
I was a good guy.	Bonum guy fui.
It was truly great.	Vere erat valde .
I can't help it	Non possum adiuvare eam
I can talk about myself	De me possum dicere
It is certain in this way.	Certum est hoc modo.
I have done it.	id feci.
It looks like a good day.	Is vultus sicut dies enim bonus.
He does almost everything right.	Ille fere omnia recte facit.
All this has been done.	Quod totum factum est.
I wonder how much you can do at the same time!	Miror quam multa simul facere potes!
I don't know even more.	Nescio etiam amplius.
You want to be there.	Vis ibi esse.
I want to do	Volo facere
I saw him go	Vidi illum sic ire

To do it beforehand.	Facere eum ante.
I can't see him.	Non possum videre eum.
Yes they are mine.	Ita sunt mea.
I knew he was my dad	Pater meus erat sciebam
I think that's all you really need to know	Puto quod omnia vere opus est scire
She asked about you.	Rogavit de te.
He could do nothing.	Nihil potuit.
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
He wants to go with you.	Vult ire tecum.
This was not done.	Non hoc factum est.
I never thought this could happen	Numquam putavi hoc fieri posse
It was something.	Erat aliquid.
I need you to go	Mihi opus est ad te ire
I want to help you always	Volo te adiuvare semper
The first one was good.	Primum bonum fuit.
You need this advice.	Hoc consilium tibi opus est.

I know you do what is better but	Scio te facere quod melius est, sed
I didn't know this could be done	Ego nesciebam hoc fieri posse
I need you.	Opus est tibi.
I told him often I don't think this way	Dixi ei saepe non cogitare hoc modo
I want help even more from me	Volo auxilium et plus a me

I think it's time for you to come home	Tempus puto te venire domum

I wish you were here with me	Utinam hic mecum
Or at least me.	Vel me certe.
I don't feel that much	Non sentio quod tantum
But he does not have to live with her.	Sed cum illa vivere non habet.
I think it may be time you know	Puto forsitan tempus tu scis
I just look	Ego iustus vultus
I don't believe so.	Non ita credo.
Please let me understand this.	Placet me hoc intelligere.
I could not do it	Non potui facere
But that is one thing.	Sed id est unum.
Not much yet.	Non multum tamen.
You know we can do it.	Scis nos id facere posse.
You can't help yourself.	Te ipsum adiuvare non potes.
I can't say what it is	Non possum dicere quid sit

But I see it.	Sed id video.
I have never been.	numquam fui.
I really aren't all there	Ego vere non omnes ibi
He alone can do it.	Solus id facere potest.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
i think i need it	Puto opus eius
I'm afraid you're not right	Vereor ne recte vos
I am you and you are me	ego sum tu et tu me
I just didn't want her in the room	Ego iustus noluit eam in cubiculum

I didn't know this	Haec ego nesciebam
He is a man.	Vir est.
This one is.	Hoc unum est.
I can't do what you do	Non possum facere quod tu facis
Unable to do this enough	Hoc facere non potuit satis
I don't want him to see me like this	Nolo illum videre me sic
I will do it again.	Iterum ego faciam.
No one wants to be in it.	Nulla in ipsum velit.
i think the future	Puto futurum

Your work is done.	Tuum est opus.
Lunch is very good.	Prandium est valde bonum.
I'm going to do my best	Ego facturus meum
I'm not good enough.	Non sum satis.
But above all he is a good man.	Sed ante omnia vir bonus est.
But it was not him.	Sed non erat ipsum.
Which is not the same.	Quod non est idem.
I truly believe that	Ego vere credo quod
I want to get away from him	Volo ut ab eius
This was his father.	Hic erat pater eius.
I just didn't know what it was	Ego iustus nesciebam quid esset
And yet it was not enough.	Et tamen parum fuit.
There was none other than that.	Nulla id nisi erat.
Yes it is here.	Ita est hic.
I thought you didn't need it	Cogitavi non opus est
I wanted to give you advice.	Volui tibi consilium dare.
I can't see you anymore	Non possum videre te amplius
Not much.	Non multum.
Everyone knows for sure.	Nescit certe.
None of us was.	Nulla a nobis erat.

Perhaps this is not what you want.	Hoc fortasse non est quod vis.
I can't believe you are my teacher	Non possum credere me magister meus es
I have what needs to be done	Ego habeo quae necesse est fieri
Now I could see	Nunc videre potui
I feel it.	id sentio.
I can't see what people don't like	Non possum videre quod homines non placet

I want you like this	Volo te sic
It's a question of when and not.	Est quaestio de quando et non.
I have not forgotten	Non sum oblitus
I thought this through	Putavi hoc per
I don't have much to it	Non habeo quantum ad eam
I knew what this meant	Sciebam quid hoc esset
To be happy	Ut sit felix
But that's the same thing.	Sed id enim ipsum.
I feel the same as me	Idem sentio, ut me
I am a just man.	Homo sum iustus.

He could not play.	Ludere non potuit.
This is not even certain.	Ne id quidem certum est.
For never and never will	Numquam enim et numquam erit
I just forgot	Ego tantum oblitus sum
I don't have time to think	Non tempus cogitare
All I can do, but not well.	Omnia possum facere, sed non bene.
I totally forgot what baby looked like	Ego prorsus oblitus es quod puer vidi amo
Now is not much time.	Nunc tempus non multum est.
I know what it is.	Scio quid sit.
No one could do this.	Hoc facere nemo potuit.

It's great for you.	Is tibi magna est.
There is certainly nothing.	Nihil certe est.
I never did it before	Numquam feci ante

That was great.	Ut id magna erat.
This one appears to be very well done.	Hoc unum videtur optime factum.
I could see again	Iterum videre potui
Please try some in yourself.	Aliquam in ipsum velit.
But no one really knows.	Sed nemo vere scit.
He has only one whole.	Totum ei unum tantum.
It is well, and it is not.	Bene est, et non est.
You are absolutely right.	Recte omnino es.
you did not just do it.	non solum id fecisti.
Yes, that's some before, that's some before.	Etiam id aliquam ante, id aliquam ante.
I wanted this to happen	Hoc fieri volui
It can't be done alone.	Solus fieri non potest.
None of the above.	Nulla in dictum est.
I'll do it soon	Et faciam ei primum
I've never been there before	Ego nunquam ibi ante
I never saw him after	Post eum numquam vidi
Before I could do it	Ante potui facere
But I don't like one.	Sed non ut unum.
If he wanted, there would be a need for him.	Si vellet, opus ei esset.
This time he himself	Hoc tempore se ipsum
He doesn't want to do that	Non vult facere quod
I need something man	Mihi opus est aliquid, vir
He's pretty sure that he had.	Ille satis certus est quod habuit.
I just love my job.	Ego iustus amo meum officium.
A its like never before	A eius sicut numquam ante
He would not.	Noluit.
There is nothing that appears here.	Nihil est quod hic videtur.
It is yours now.	Tuum est, nunc.

I thought that's good	Cogitavi quod bonum est
I'm fine too.	Bene etiam sum.
This just isn't for me.	Hoc modo non enim mihi.
I will do this alone	Hoc solum faciam

He didn't have a job, he did nothing.	Non habet officium, nihil fecit.
I don't want him to be alone	Nolo eum esse solum
I've had something yet	Ego quoque aliquid adhuc
You know, probably not.	Scis, verisimile non est.
To, if any, from.	Ut vel nulla ex.
It's almost everything about me.	Est enim fere omnia de me.
I'll tell her just yet	Dicam ei, modo nondum
Maybe you don't need it.	Fortasse non opus est.
Thus he gave.	Sic dedit.
I know where that boy is.	Scio ubi sit ille puer.
Not quite ready	Non satis paratus
He soon departed.	Is mox abiit.

It is for sure.	Est certe.
I wish I was at home	Vellem erat domi
I didn't know to work	Ad opus non scivi
I think they're scared to say no	Puto quod nimium vix dicere non
how we got	quam nos obtinuit.

I told her to get along with you this week.	Dixi ei ut una tecum hac septimana.
I was there for the first time to meet	Ibi primum occurrit fui
i thought he was.	Putabam erat.
I think this is what this was all about	Puto hoc esse quod hoc erat de omnibus
What nationality is it.	Quod genus est.
A plan was to go now	A consilium erat ut nunc
I want to leave this house for you	Volo domum hanc relinquere tibi
i really hope i love it	Ego vere spero te amo eam
I know what you want	Scio quod velis
I can't get all three	Non possum non omnes tres
I like it too.	Mihi quoque placet.
You can't think like this.	Non potes cogitare te sic.
I'm sure it will work	Ego certe non erit opus illud
I really should have	Ego vere debet habere
This can help you	Hoc possum adiuvare vos
Well.	Bene.
I don't like anything.	Nec quicquam simile.
But say in this way.	Sed dic hoc modo.
It is true.	Verum est.
I just want to go home now	Ego iustus volo ire domum iam
I've already been told in	Ego iam dictum est in
That's a save there.	Ut a nisi erat.
No it is right now.	Nulla id est nunc.
I don't know right now.	Nescio nunc.
I don't need much to talk about.	Non opus est multa loqui.
I tried to see everything.	Conatus est videre omnia.
I don't want my father.	Nolo pater.
Time could not have been better	Tempus non potuit melius esse
Where or where?	Vel ubi ubi.
It was not that morning.	Mane illum non erat.
I'm not sure what to believe	Non certus sum quid credere
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est verum.
This time it was different.	Hoc tempore aliud fuit.
What I could not do	Quid facere non potui
You have done your job.	Fecisti officium tuum.
I don't really know him	Non vere scio eum
I can't say why.	Non possum dicere quare.
Not a year ago.	Non anno.
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum quam.
I saw people really.	Vidi homines vere.
Look at what he did.	Vide quid fecerit.
You are so happy.	Tam felix es.
I need to get there.	Mihi opus est illuc.
I really know better	Ego vere scio melius
That day is coming.	Ille dies venit.
I wonder where she was	Miror ubi fuit
I know you can find it if anyone can	Scio te invenire eam si quis potest
We can do nothing now.	Nihil nunc facere possumus.
So you too.	Sic et vos.
I think like this.	Hoc simile puto.
In this way I wanted not to be true.	Hoc modo volui non verum esse.
I didn't know what was in it	Ego nesciebam quid esset in eo
He did not know what was wrong.	Nesciebat quid mali esset.
Those who follow her.	Qui post eam.
It is certainly a great thing.	Magna certe res est.
I hope you got home well.	Spero te bene domum obtinuit.
I really just want to talk to you	Ego vere iustus volo loqui ad vos
I am very much with him	Ego sum nimis cum eo

I just want to see how everything went	EGO iustus volo video vidi quomodo omnia abiit
Well done.	Recte factum.
But he is the one who did it.	Sed ipse qui id fecerit.
I need to understand everything	Mihi opus est intelligere omnia
I could not.	Non potui.
And so good.	Et ita bonum.
And you can do it at home.	Et potes id facere domi.
I need someone I know	Mihi opus est ad aliquem novi
All he wants to do is help.	Omnes facere vult auxilium.
I thought like he said that	Cogitavi sicut dixit quod
I don't know where it is.	Nescio ubi sit.
Now that's the same thing before.	Nunc id ipsum ante.
But it's good enough!	Sed satis est bonum!.
I need some help with this.	Hoc opus est aliquo auxilio.
I knew looking very well	Sciebam vultus optime
I am a little better than he is	Ego sum paulo melius quam ipse est
Find out as much as you can.	Invenire quantum potes.
So it is.	Ita est.
Something in that.	Aliquid qui.
It's his time now.	Eius est nunc.
He always knows.	Semper scit.
don't believe me.	Non credo me.
I could not find	Non potui invenire
I know just where she is	Scio sicut ubi est
I have to go to school	Habeo ire ad schola

I knew it too.	Sciebam etiam.
I think he was	Puto eum fuisse
I always knew that I could not be his real name	Semper scivi quod non potuit esse eius verum nomen
That said, yes, she's sorry.	Quod dixit etiam illa paenitet.
This was too much for me.	Nimium enim hoc mihi erat.
I have nothing wrong with him	Ego nihil mali in eo
We all met before ever.	Omnes ante nos semper occurrit.
For he did not do things.	Non enim fecit res.
To her again.	Ad eam iterum.
I think you'll leave it to me	Puto te hoc mihi relinquere
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
I said it doesn't work	Dixi ei non opus
No that was none.	Nulla id erat nulla.
All you ever met.	Omnes tibi semper occurrit.
Much better than this really can't be.	Multo melius quam hoc vere non potest.
I never got to get out of it	Numquam obtinuit ut ex eo
I really didn't want to go to work	Ego vere noluit ire ad officium
I wanted him.	eum volui.
And that's who.	Et id quis.
It was not very nice.	Non erat admodum.
I couldn't believe he said	Non potui credere dixit
That's good to hear.	Quod est bonum, audire.
I couldn't be out of time	Non potui esse ex tempore
He did something.	Fecit aliquid.
Yes, but it was not.	Etiam non nisi erat.
He saw now.	Vidit nunc.
To-morrow	Cras ut enim.
I have to sit.	Habeo ut sit.
He was a man.	Homo erat.
I told you this is going to happen	Hoc dixi tibi futurum
I need some time alone to deal with everything	Mihi opus est aliquo tempore solum agere cum omnia
It's something to do for him.	Est aliquid facere sibi.
She was, and yet was not.	Illa erat, et tamen non erat.
That was it.	Erat id.
You're doing this.	Hoc facere es.
I think you help us all	Puto te adiuvare nos omnes
I didn't know he was there	Ego nesciebam eum ibi
It is truly.	Est vere.
Now I can say the same about you	Idem nunc possum dicere de te
You can do so.	Ita facere potes.
I'm not at all	Ut omnino non sum
I met the man yesterday	Et occurrit vir heri
The boy who can	Puer qui potest
You know what's going to happen.	Scis futurum.
I'm sure some of us could go with it.	Certus sum nos posse aliquo ire cum eo.
I said the same thing	Idem dixi
And that is.	Et id est est.
I know what's going to happen.	Scio quid sit futurum.
i am very happy	ego sum valde felix
I knew who this person is	Scivi quis hic homo est
He could not, however.	Non potuit, sed.
Tell me now.	Dic modo mecum.
I think you're good enough today	Puto te satis hodie
Certainly he could not buy it.	Certe emere non potuit.
Everything looks great.	Omnia spectat magna.
What's the boy like? 	Quid puer similis?
Well today I'm happy.	Bene hodie gaudeo.
and you know.	et scis.
But as it was.	Sed ut erat.
I'm not sure, but perhaps.	Non sum certus, sed fortasse.
Don't think that you can do it.	Noli putare te id facere posse.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
There is none there	Non est ibi
I have work to do here	Habeo opus facere huc
But that was great.	Sed ut magna erat.
To him to be.	Eum ut esse.
But it is well that you did not do it.	Sed bene est quod non fecisti.
Never say anything	Numquam quid dicam
I want to know what you did.	Scire volo quid feceris.
He also says that he knows me.	Etiam id dicit ut me novit.
It could not be necessary.	Necesse non potuit.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
And I told you	Ego autem dixi tibi
When this was not enough, it was difficult.	Quod cum parum esset, id difficile erat.
I thought it would be better than	Putavi fore quam
It's not enough yet.	Non satis adhuc est.
I wanted it again	Volui eam iterum
I'd definitely like it.	Id certe libet.
But neither was it said.	Sed nec dictum erat.
Nothing seems like it.	Nihil simile ei videtur.
It seemed even longer.	Videbatur etiam diutius.
I want to do my job	Volo facere officium meum
You said you didn't see yourself live.	Vivere te dixisti non videre.
I do not have.	Non habeo.
I can't see what you need	Non possum videre quod opus
I don't want to hear you again	Non vis audire iterum
I know you better than anyone else does	Scio te melius quam quis aliud facit
For the time being.	Pro tempore.
I apologize for that	Ego paenitet quod
He didn't want to talk.	Nolebat loqui.
I'm not here right now.	Hic nunc non sum.
I know you too.	Novi te quoque.
He did not want this to be his home.	Noluit hoc sibi esse domum.
What you have said.	Quae dixisti.
He does a better job.	Melius officium facit.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
To all there	Ut omnes ibi
He never said so much.	Numquam tantum dixit.
I knew one day	Sciebam futurum una die
Good to see and hear from you again.	Bene te videre et iterum audire.
never get to it	Numquam ad eam
As well as I could go home	Sicut etiam potui ire domum suam
I could not go on this	Hoc ire non potui
Which is rightly said.	Quod recte dictum est.
I don't want to go for tonight like this	Non vult pro hac nocte ire sic
I don't know what's wrong.	Nescio quid mali est.
I know how to play it	Scio quomodo ludere eam
He was probably thirty.	Probabiliter triginta erat.
I am really sorry for thinking about it all day	Ego vere paenitet haec omnia hodie cogitas in eo
That's us.	Id nobis.
No I don't like that.	Nulla non ut quam.
I am not quite sure that	Ego non satis certus quod
All so quickly.	Omnes tam cito.
I really wanted to think about it	Ego vere voluit cogitare de illo
I need to go through the day	Mihi opus est ut per diem
He does it easily.	Facile id facit.
I am not going to be easy	Non sum facturus facile
This seems to have happened	Hoc videtur factum
Yes that is great.	Etiam id magna est.
I want to see and hear for me	Volo videre et audire pro me
I told her that it was okay	Non indicavit ei quod erat bene
I knew.	Sciebam.
I never even like her.	Numquam etiam eius simile.
And you can do nothing about it.	Et nihil de eo facere potes.
I still do a lot.	Adhuc multum mihi facio.
yet I have this plan.	id tamen habeo consilium.
He was.	Ille erat.
It was what it was.	Erat quod erat.
He inquired why.	Quaesivit quare.
We indeed.	Nos quidem.
Mine won't be that way.	Meus non erit illuc.
I hope that's ut	Spero autem quod ut
Yes, you really owe a lot.	Ita, vere multum debes.
I didn't have to say me	Dicere non habui me
I've done this for us too, you know	nobis quoque hoc feci, scis
My man will always be with me	Semper meus homo mecum
I really love him	Ego vere amo eum
Looks like what's happened.	Simile quid acciderit.
I don't have enough money.	Non satis pecuniae.
I want to get married one day	Volo uxorem dies unus
But it seems to hinder it, but not it.	Illud autem videtur prohibere, non autem illud.
I can hear you, you know	In te audire possum, tu scis
But he did not say what it was.	Sed non dixit quid esset.
I hardly see anything	Vix video aliquid
I didn't want to say	Nolui dicere
It is not true.	Non est verum.
To do something.	Facere aliquid.
I can't say it was bad	Non possum dicere fuit malum
I don't think it would work	Non puto fore opus
But this seems to be the case now.	Sed hoc iam ita se habere videtur.
I didn't know what it was	Ego nesciebam quod esset
I think that you like	Puto quod tibi placet
i'm ready to be done.	paratus sum fieri.
It is not easy, it is difficult.	Non facile, difficile est.
He does also.	Facit etiam.
maybe you should do it.	fortasse facias.
I like this one.	Hoc unum mihi placet.
I don't think much of it	Non videtur multum ab eo quod
It is very unlikely.	Valde probabile est.
I am the only one who knows.	Solus sum qui scit.
He has not.	Non habet.
So perhaps something to do with it.	Ita fortasse aliquid ad rem.
I never saw behind me	Numquam vidi post me
I think it's enough for him	Satis mihi videtur pro illo
Nothing else.	Nihil aliud.
I want to talk about this	Volo loqui de hoc
I like this way.	Placet hoc modo.
AND THE YEAR	ET ANNO .
I guess that's the thing, we're all	Suspicor eam rem, omnes nos
I'm happy to have your help	Sum felix habere auxilium tuum
I won't do it on time	Non faciam eam in tempore
I couldn't do it	Ego non potui facere
This is a good thing.	Ita res bona est.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
I wanted, but not	Volui, sed non
I want to make it happen here	Volo facere futurum hic
I know all is well	Scio omnia bene esse
You stay there without me.	Te ibi sine me manere.
I have one too.	Habeo unum quoque.
The day is already	Dies iam est.
I wish him well.	Volo eum bene esse.
not quite well.	Non satis bene.
I didn't know where we are	Ego nesciebam ubi sumus
Yes, they are exactly the same.	Ita est, prorsus idem sunt.
I don't know how to get it.	Nescio quomodo ad illud.
No one did it.	Non quis fecit.
I don't know enough.	Non satis scio.
I will tell the truth all the time.	Ego verum nunc dicam omnibus.
I haven't seen it since that time	Non vidi eam ex eo tempore
This was too much.	Nimium hoc fuit.
I haven't seen him	Non vidi eum
Nothing new to say	Nihil novi dicere
now we are one.	nunc unum sumus.
I don't doubt	Non dubito
Yes, that was how.	Etiam ut erat quam.
There was a man in him.	Vir erat in eo.
yes that's a great idea.	Etiam id magna ex.
Who made him first.	Primum quis fecit illum.
I am at home.	Domi ego sum.
I probably already told you way too much	Probabiliter iam dixi me modo nimis
I'm not friends	Non sum amicos
Nothing I wanted to do	Nihil volui facere
That's not before.	Id ante et non.
I appreciate the de	Et bene de
I didn't know what	Ego nesciebam quid
Yes, as has been said.	Etiam ut dictum est.
I wanted to go to school	Volui ire ad scholam
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
I knew what else was	Sciebam quid esset aliud
Maybe she didn't see it.	Fortasse non vidit eam.
I don't want to go.	ire nolo.
The latest one said loudly.	Aliquam quis dictum magna.
It was not intended.	Non voluit.
You told us what to do.	Dixisti nobis quid facerem.
This has already been done.	Hoc iam factum est.
I think we talk	Puto nos loqui
Watch this video.	Hoc vide video.
I probably never will	Ego probabiliter numquam erit
He said too much, perhaps to himself.	Dixit, nimis, fortasse sibi.
I know what you mean too.	Scio quid velit etiam.
I wanted to find out more about it	De eo invenire volui
I stop too much	Ego quoque multa prohibere
This has nothing to do with me.	Hoc nihil ad me.
I don't want to talk to you.	Nolo tecum loqui.
now this.	hic, nunc.
I really better get someone there soon.	Ego vere melius aliquem illuc primum.
At least I want it.	Id certe volo.
You'll never want to do it.	Numquam vis id.
I've seen it before.	Ego ante vidi.
I really love you little	Ego vere amo, parum
No no no or none.	Nulla non nulla vel nulla.
I thought about you yesterday and before that day too	Cogitavi de te heri et ante id quoque dies
That was too bad.	Nimis id malum fuit.
No one seemed to know where he was.	Nemo videbatur scire ubi esset.
He wants to be	Ut velit fieri
I thought I would be with him	Putavi fore ut cum eo
Do the one you want.	Fac ille velis.
I don't really know that well	Non vere scio quod bene
when by chance.	Cum forte.
So I feel really happy.	Ita sentio vere felix.
I don't need any time to think	Non opus est aliquo tempore cogitare
Nothing else to do.	Nihil aliud facere.
It is also difficult.	Etiam difficile est.
never thought	Nunquam cogitavi
Who knows.	Quis scit.
I know you even got it	Scio quidem obtinuit eam
There's nothing like here.	Nihil ut hic.
I can't say what he thinks	Non possum dicere quod cogitat
I thought it was too hard for you.	Putavi difficile esse tibi.
See you again soon.	Mox iterum te videre.
All right.	Omnia recte.
I told you.	Dixi vobis.
which he did not know.	quam nesciebat.
I don't do anything to you	Non aliquid tibi
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
I am not very sure	Non sum valde certus
I thought this job is important	Hoc officium cogitavi sit amet
It's not true.	Suus 'non est verum.
But there was a lot to do.	Sed sit amet erat.
You know you can't.	Scis non potes.
No time for that story.	Aliquam id tempus nulla.
You did not do this.	Hoc non fecisti.
I want you to believe in me too	Volo te quoque in omnibus mihi credere
You'll never get that.	Numquam enim ut.
I know what you mean.	Scio quid velit.
I think he can be seen.	Videri se posse puto.
No but it is great	Nulla sed magna est
I can't do anything about it	Non possum aliquid de eo
I need to do something wrong.	Mihi necesse est esse aliquid mali.
I never saw anything like	Numquam vidi aliquid simile
I really want that to be true	Ego vere volo quod verum esset
It has been said for sure.	Dictum est certe.
I just bought a house there	Ego iustus emit domum ibi
I just like him	Modo ut eum
There is something you can do about it.	Est autem aliquid de eo facere potes.
Maybe there was something in it.	Fortasse aliquid in eo erat.
I can't do what you think	Non possum non quod cogitas
Maybe something else too.	Fortasse aliud quoque.
I don't want him on me like that	Nolo illum de me sicut quod
I never need anyone	Numquam quis mihi opus
I'm not sure why.	Non sum certus cur.
It is almost true.	Fere verum est.
Do one thing, do it yourself very well.	Unum fac, fac optime et hoc ipsum.
Not here, but.	Non hic, sed.
I didn't want to go through it	Nolui ire per illum
You can help me.	Potes me adiuvare.

I knew what it seemed	Sciebam quod videbatur
All I can say to him	Omnia possum dicere ei
You're going to get home to me.	Facturus es domum ad me.
It's his.	Eius est.

I know what's happened	Scio quid acciderit
But that's not the same thing.	Sed id non ipsum.
Trying something new.	Conatur aliquid novi.
I tried to get it done	Conatus sum ut ex quo factum est
Maybe not so much.	Fortasse non ita esse.
I don't know how much fun	Nescio quomodo multum sit amet
You can do whatever you want.	Potes quod vis.
I certainly can't	Ego certe non potest
I'm glad to hear this.	Gaudeo hoc audire.
This is your plan.	Hoc consilium tuum est.
She just wasn't much.	Illa iustus erat non multum.
But it looks great to me.	Sed mihi magna videtur.
It is true for all.	Verum est omnibus.
I didn't know him	Et ego nesciebam eum
But if you want.	Sed si vis.
And that's now.	Et id nunc.
But you are not.	Sed non es.
You know you can do the job.	Scis te officium facere posse.
I can't do anything, talk to someone	Non possum facere quicquam, loqui ad aliquem
That's it.	Hoc illud est.
How well do you	Ut bene tibi
Been enough for me	Satis per me fuisse
and he is himself.	et es- se.
He does so.	Ita facit.
Husband to wife	Vir ad uxorem
I hope to hear something from you.	Spero audire aliquid ex te.
So pretty good.	Ita satis est bonum.
Right after you.	Recte post te.

I am doing so now.	Sic nunc facio.
I see you in everything	Ego te per omnia
It is important to take some time.	Aliquam sit amet aliquam est.
hard to do anything	Difficile facere quicquam
None of the above said.	Nulla a dictum enim.
She'll be fine.	Illa bene erit.
I have this.	hoc habeo.
I never thought	Numquam putavi
I would like to chat with him	Vellem loqui cum eo
I still don't believe it to be.	Ego tamen non credo eam esse.
It was about going to something	Fuit de eo ad aliquid
Get late for dinner	Ut nuper ad cenam
You need to take that off.	Accipere debes qui sunt.
It does not please.	Non placet.
I wanted first	Volui primum
Nothing like it used to be.	Nihil simile fieri solebat.
I'm glad that you are here now	Gaudeo quod hic es, nunc
Certainly I am not sure.	Certe ego sum certus.
I was ready	Paratus eram
I was told	Dictum est mihi
You can help.	Potes adiuvare.
Not in that way.	Non eo modo.
That was not enough.	Non satis id erat.
Maybe he didn't know what to do.	Fortasse nesciebat quid faceret.
But that is not now.	Sed id nunc non est.
I did for him	Ego feci pro eo
I know what is true	Scio quid verum sit
There, there	Ibi, ibi.
I can't live without you	Non possum vivere nec sine te
But there is only one thing that he cannot do.	Sed tantum est quod facere non potest.
Back to now.	Ad nunc.
I only tried to get it	Tantum conatus ad eam
It truly is something.	Vere est aliquid.
He would not.	Noluit.
I don't want to be here without you	Nolo hic esse sine te
I don't think much of this	Non videtur multum hoc
I have money and everything	Pecuniam habeo et omnia
Only I could talk to me	Tantum potui loqui ad me
Well, well indeed.	Bene, bene quidem.
I can't tell you how to do this	Non possum dicere quam hoc
I can't believe I'll buy something like this	Non possum credere me tibi aliquid simile hoc emere
What's there for me to do.	Quid ibi me facerem.
Which one is similar.	Quod est simile.
I think you're getting into time to say	Puto te in tempore questus dicere
I tried to get out of it	Conatus sum ut ex eo
You had to go.	Tu quoque ut.
She doesn't know enough where she is.	Nescit satis ubi sit.
Can't play anymore.	Ludere amplius non potest.
Never get anything from you	Numquam accipere quod a te
Something's wrong with anyone.	Aliquid mali ut quis.
That's not good.	Id non.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
Better to be.	Melius esse.
I am the one who is interested	Ego unus qui sit amet
I want to help you	Ego volo tibi auxilium
I just don't believe in that much	Ego iustus non est in eo quod multum
I didn't know you	Ego nesciebam te
You know how you do it? 	Scis, quomodo id facis?
But he does the work.	Sed facit opus.
Not sure why.	Non certus cur.
I hope you find what you like	Spero te invenire quae placet
Not even to us.	Ne nobis quidem.
I see all the time	Omnia tempus video nec
Yes it is for us too.	Ita est etiam pro nobis.
You might feel like it was too much.	Fortasse nimis placet fuit.
I feel always much better	Sentio semper multo melius
I doubt he ever did	Dubito quod semper fecit
I don't feel very good about myself	Non sentio de me ipsum bonum
This is where it is.	Haec ubi sit.
Do as you want.	Fac ut vis.
It is necessary to speak of this.	Hoc loqui necesse est.
I'll see you this morning.	Ego te hoc mane videre.

It is certain that he will still be there	Certum est eum ibi adhuc esse
I need to think so quickly	Mihi opus est cogitare et cito
We're not on a date or anything.	Non sumus in diem vel aliquid.
Unless you .	Nisi te .
This also was nothing new.	Hoc quoque nihil novi fuit.
He thinks.	Putat.
I couldn't say no to him	Non potui dicere non ei
I want it for you	Volo eam ad vos
Soon he comes to me.	Mox ad me venit.
It looks really good.	Is vultus vere bonus est.
First I have to talk to him	Primum habeo loqui ei
I just can't help me	Ego iustus non possum me
I hope I'm too.	Spero me nimis.
You can't find it again.	Iterum invenire non potes.
He is the only one who can do it today.	Solus est qui id facere potest hodie.
You do not owe the same.	Idem non debes.
All in all.	Omnino.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
A little scared for him, but even better for him.	Ei paulo vix, sed ei etiam melius.
He is still gone.	Adhuc abiit.
I can't know the future	Non possum scire futurum
but you know.	sed scis.
If necessary.	Si opus est.

He does all things great.	Omnia magna facit.
I was here before.	Hic ante eram.
Make sure to do it for you.	Fac ut faciam tibi.
TO THE FATHER	AD PATER.
I've never been here before.	Nunquam hic ante fui.
I could not speak.	dicere non potui.
That's hardly him.	Quod ei vix.
Do your job.	Fac officium tuum.
What happened to me	Quod factum est ad me

I don't know what is this	Nescio quid hoc
I can't help you like	Non possum te ut auxilium
I'm not getting help	Non est questus sum auxilio
Now it was not certain.	Iam certum non erat.
I saw you yesterday	Vidi heri
I wonder what else is there	Miror quid aliud ibi
There will be.	Ibi erit.
But he saw.	Sed vidit.
No that was none.	Nulla id nulla erat.
I just know it.	Modo id scio.
i don't know how to do it.	facere nescio.
Not that's what she did, really.	Non id est quod fecit, vere.
This is the same thing.	Hoc idem.
But he was not there.	Sed non erat enim.
He didn't want to even think about it.	Noluit etiam cogitare de eo.
And not.	Et non.
He was not here.	Ut non erat hic.
I know what you will do	Scio quid facturus sit
He was not.	Non erat.

You must be well.	Bene esse debes.

I don't like it very much	Et non placet valde
It was pretty bad.	Satis malum fuit.
This is so, I believe	Hoc ita est, credo

This is correct.	Hoc bene est.

And here we are.	Et hic sumus.
We can't talk.	Non possumus dicere.
That's what you want.	Id velis.
I am astonished, very surprised to hear this	Miror, valde miror hoc audire
He did not know.	Nesciebat.
None or more important than that.	Nulla vel magna quam.
But he did not do this.	Sed hoc non fecit.
So exactly what you will do.	Ita prorsus quid facturus sit.
This man is.	Hic homo est.
I can't say how long	Non possum dicere quam diu
But see to us.	Sed vide nobis.
I don't feel much.	Non multum sentio.
he asked if he could come.	quaesivit si posset venire.

Or to be before.	Vel ante esse.
I'm pretty busy right now this morning	Satis occupatus sum iam hoc mane
what I have done.	quod ego feci.

I want to help him.	Volo eum adiuvare.
Nothing can be.	Nihil esse potest.
Not before time	Non ante tempus.
Not with me.	Non apud me.
It was, however.	Erat tamen.
I was a little busy today.	Ut esset hodie parum occupatus.

See this if there is need.	Hoc vide, si opus est.
I told you everything	Dixi vobis omnia

I'll tell you what is yours	Dicam tibi, tuum esse potest
What could have been done.	Quod fieri potuit.
I do not know what	Nescio quid
You just make it happen.	Tu modo id fac fieri.
I plan to stay here with you	Cogitavi hic manere, apud te
He would not do this.	Hoc facere noluit.
I like to do my best.	Ego ut meum consilium faciam.
Probably not.	Verisimiliter non erit.
This is all.	Hoc totum est.
I tried to understand what she meant.	Conatus sum intelligere quid sibi vellet.
got it here	Hic obtinuit eam
I couldn't take it anymore	Non potui amplius accipere
I want something else	Volo aliquid aliud
I wonder how it came to know	Miror quomodo factum est scire
i still have you to have me	ego tamen sum vos habere me
You're still there.	Tu ibi adhuc.
I feel better doing it.	Melius sentio facere.
It doesn't seem so.	Non ita videtur.
I still need to keep it up for a longer period of time	Ego adhuc opus est ut eum ad tempus diutius
I can't talk by looking at you	Non possum dicere per vultus apud te
Yes exactly right.	Ita prorsus recte.
No, you know.	Non est, scis.
I know you better.	Novi te melius.
I didn't know what it was	Ego nesciebam quid esset
I really want to help her	Ego vere velle ad auxilium eius
Which has not yet been done.	Quod nondum factum est.
I can't do this	Non possum hoc facere
No.	Non.
I am ready for him	Ego paratus sum pro eo
I think you'd like it.	Puto id velis.
I didn't think.	Non putavi.

That time is not like today.	Id tempus non sicut hodie.
I was sure you'd do it	Certus eram tibi facere velis
I can't play it any	Non possum quis ludere eam
Something other than that.	Aliquid quam.
Look at the same thing.	Idem vide.
I don't need someone who is hard	Non opus sit aliquis qui est difficile
It would seem that it is so evil.	Videtur quod ita sit malum.
Something surprised me.	Aliquid miror.
I know they are.	Novi sunt.
This is probably not true.	Hoc verisimile non est.
I couldn't talk to him	Non potui dicere ei non
You're very right.	Recte admodum es.
But it is also true.	Sed etiam verum est.
It was to be.	Esse erat.
When I first met him	Ego cum ante occurrit ei
As soon as he could speak, he tried again.	Cum primum loqui potuit, iterum conatus est.
I was told he is a man	Dictum est mihi homo est
I looked through to see who it was	Vidi per videre quis esset
I always wanted a dog	Canem semper volui
I still have it today.	Adhuc hodie habeo.
But we still need it.	Verum tamen nobis opus est.
But nothing is necessary about this.	Sed de hoc nihil est necesse.
He wanted to see what was going to happen.	Quid futurum esset videre voluit.
I do a lot of that	Ego multum quod

I would like to do some better	Hoc facere vellem aliquo modo melius
I feel the way I feel	Sic sentio sentio
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
I think it's already there	Puto iam ibi esse
I knew what was going to happen	Sciebam quid esset futurum
To do so now.	Ut id nunc.
Not that.	Non id.
I could not help myself.	Non potui me adiuvare.
That is to never	Id est, ut numquam
Where he was.	Ubi erat.
I think more to win	Puto plus vincere
It is too much.	Nimis est.
And it's okay.	Et bene est.
All right!	Recte!.
I have seen nothing like it before	Nihil vidi simile ante
I wanted the job done correctly this time	Volui officium recte factum hoc tempore
I tried too hard.	Conatus sum difficile.
There is nothing to talk about.	Nihil loqui est.
I need to really listen	Mihi opus est ut vere audire
But the time is right.	Sed in tempus est.
I want to be here as soon as possible	Volo hic quam primum
He didn't want to be here.	Noluit hic esse.
A day is a day, and there is no day.	Dies est dies, et non est dies.
i am scared of anything else	Ego vix quicquam aliud
No one knows everything.	Nemo scit omnia.

And if not.	Et nisi.
What would you like to see now.	Quid nunc velis videre.
Nothing to go with it	Ire cum eo nihil
He didn't know anything.	Nesciebat aliquid.
You can do that.	Quod facere potes.
It's not always that.	Etiam non semper quam.
There is no way to do that.	Est facere nulla ut.
I told him not to come	Dixi ei non venire
I don't know what is this	Nescio quid hoc
It truly is who we are.	Vere est qui sumus.
I know a lot about this	Scio de hoc multum
That he has evil.	Quod habet malum.
I haven't thought about that much before	Non cogitavi ut multo ante
I wanted to be with him	Volui esse cum eo
This is the thing.	Hoc est res.
Police said he was out.	Aliquam dictum ex erat.
I wonder what that was	Miror quid id erat
I've heard something too late	Ego quoque nuper audivi aliquid
I don't think that's one thing.	Non puto esse unum.
He understood nothing more.	Nihil amplius intellexit.
It was not what he had already imagined.	Non erat id quod iam putabat.
I know that I can	Scio posse
I am astonished.	Miror.
But he was not.	Sed non erat ille.
She was there one day later.	Fuit ibi post diem unum.
I want to know her better	Volo scire eam melius
i thought someone was behind me	Putabam aliquem esse post me
which indeed could not have been done.	Quod quidem fieri non potuit.
if you know, you know.	si scis, scis.
i love what i can do for my job.	amo quod possum facere officium meum.
I don't know where it is until noon	Nescio ubi sit usque ad meridiem
Someone just can't do it.	Aliquis iustus facere potest eam.
That was great.	Magna id erat.
I was a man among men	Vir fui inter homines
But that's no problem here.	Sed id nulla hic.
I wonder what that meant.	Miror quid id esset.
And after that.	Et post illud.
He at last saw him.	Hic tandem vidit illum.
I really want you not to say	Ego vere volo te non dixit
It was the same thing but never.	Erat id ipsum sed numquam.
I knew what to stop	Sciebam quod prohibere
I have it here.	Habeo hic.
It was, however.	Erat tamen.
I really can't deal with this now	Ego vere non potest agere cum hoc nunc
I've never been there	Ego numquam ibi
It's something.	Est aliquid.
I can't find anything	Non possum invenire aliquid
I'm afraid to think what's happened	Vereor cogitare quid acciderit
I can't say what to do	Non possum dicere quid facere
I can't stop thinking.	Non possum prohibere cogitas.
So here's a little like.	Ita parum hic similis est.
It is not so here.	Non ita est hic.
You can and you need to.	Potes, et debes.
This may or may not be true.	Hoc potest vel non esse verum.
I said something a little ago	Dixi quod paulo ante
I know exactly how it is	Prorsus scio quomodo sit
I can help you	Non possum adiuvare vos
Unable to stop.	Posset prohibere.
you have to go again.	ut iterum habes.
I will do it again	Iterum me facere quod
But that's none at all.	Sed id aliquam nulla.
I told him we are friends and nothing more	Dixi ei nos esse amicos et nihil amplius
Take a look at this and this.	Vide hoc et hoc.
That's pretty much it.	Id fere est.
You'll never want to be without you again	Numquam vis esse sine te iterum
No one knows us.	Nemo nos novit.
But with all things.	Sed cum omnia.
I said 'just for us'	Dixi, modo pro nobis
I just want this to happen	Ego iustus volo hoc fieri
Question	Quaestio.
Well kind.	Bene genus.
I still believe today.	Ego tamen hodie credo.
No problem not here.	Hic nulla quaestio ne.
I said this.	id dixi.
I thought what I wanted	Putavi quod voluit
It's time and before.	Aliquam et ante.
He would not do this.	Hoc nolebat.
I am sure this will not be my time	Pro certo habeo hoc non esse meum tempus
It was too much.	Nimis erat.
now I feel it.	nunc sentio.
I just wonder if it's true	Ego iustus miror si verum est
I need to be able to see	Mihi opus est posse videre
I had to do it yesterday	Habui facere heri
Maybe he didn't really want to.	Fortasse non vere voluit.
See as much as you can.	Vide quantum potes.
I don't think so	Non puto ita esse
This is not what he says.	Hoc non est quod dicit.
I certainly don't want it	Ego certe volo eam non
You know my work.	Scis opus meum.
We have enough money to travel now.	Satis pecuniae ad iter nunc habemus.
I can't say enough good things about it	Non possum dicere satis bona de eo
But that's no right now.	Sed id nulla nunc.
I know you do it too	Scio te id quoque
I know you don't want to stop now	Scio te non velle prohibere modo
I think it's okay	Puto bene factum est
We are not together.	Non una sumus.
I don't know what it is.	Quae sit nescio.
I don't want to see anyone	Non vis videre quis
I tried to find it.	Conatus est invenire eam.
I want to hear.	Audire volo.
I will be happy	Me esse felix
I have seen it too.	Vidi etiam.
To listen to each other.	Audire se.
I don't feel right.	Non recte sentio.
I am him.	ego eum.
I don't know what's wrong with her	Nescio quid mali eius
He does not do this.	Hoc non facit.
I feel good with you	Sentio bonum tecum
I can't get enough of it	Non possum satis ex eo
Maybe he is gone at all.	Fortasse omnino abiit.
There's nothing wrong here I'm not	Nihil mali hic non sum
You do not want.	Non vis.
I know you've seen everything	Scio te vidi omnia
And that's what you are.	Et id est quod es.
I love to play with him	Amo ludere cum eo
I hope you're all on time	Spero tibi omnia in tempore
And you can do it.	Et facere potes.
But she forgot.	Sed illa oblitus est.
He did not see.	Non vidit.
I don't know your name.	Nescio nomen tuum.
I guess he loves you	Suspicor quod amat te
Certainly today is not a day.	Certe hodie non est dies.
He still knows him.	Adhuc novit eum.
I only saw him after	Tantum vidit eum post
You can have everything you want.	Omnia quae vis habere potes.
i think he always has	Puto se semper habet
It is not easy.	Non facile.
There's no help.	Non ibi auxilium.
Last week.	Septimana.
I wish I saw him	Volo vidi illum
Getting there.	Questus est.
I am nothing and everything.	nihil sum et omnia.
To see the truth of that.	Eius videre verum.
It will not be the same.	Non idem futurum est.
There is no question.	Nulla quaestio est.
He never wants to see her again.	Numquam iterum eam videre velit.
I could see nothing at all	Nihil omnino facere potui videre
We can do this quickly, if you will.	Hoc cito, si vis, possumus.
I'm afraid about that.	Vereor ut.
He wants us.	Nobis velit.
But before that time.	Sed id tempus ante.
I will say this even before.	Dicam hoc usque ante.
I think nothing of it	Puto quod ex eo nihil
I don't want him.	Nolo illum.
I think he's a man	Puto ille vir
I don't know what to say.	Quid dicam nescio.
I don't want to do it	Non vis ut faciam illud
We are not late out.	Nos non sero e.
He didn't want to go.	Noluit ire.
I just want to see it	Ego iustus volo video vidi illum
Maybe not yourself.	Aliquam nec ipsum.
I heard so much about you	Audivi tantum de te
Either way, he said yes.	Utrumque dixit quod sic.
I want it too	Volo id quoque
I just want to be true.	EGO iustus volo verum.
I never thought about that before	Numquam cogitavi ut ante
I've heard it here.	Audivi hic.
It's home to me.	Domi mihi est.
Something was wrong.	Aliquid mali fuit.
You are doing well.	Bene facis.
I knew today was coming	Sciebam hodie venire
Well, it never happened.	Bene, nunquam factum est.
That was a bad time for him.	Quod ei tempus malum fuit.
I was not so.	Non ita eram.
The man was very busy.	Vir erat valde occupatus.
He said that all was well.	Dixit se omnia bene esse.
To you home.	Ad te domum.
I can't say for sure what it is	Non possum dicere pro certo quod est
Plan as much as you can.	Cogitas quantum potes.
Not much, really.	Non multum, vere.
I could not speak or think	Non potui loqui vel cogitare
This one is not another	Hoc unum non est aliud
But I don't get any of it.	Sed non aliquam ex.
i am just not sure of him yet	Ego iustus non certus eius adhuc
He wants something more.	Plus aliquid vult.
I really would like to know you.	Ego vere scire te vellem.
No force, but.	Nulla vis, sed.
If you want to see me, I had	Si me vis videre, habui
What to do.	Quod ut facerem.
You did it.	Fecisti.
it is necessary.	est necesse est.
ya i like.	Puer mihi placet.
We are together in this.	Simul in hoc sumus.
i am really pretty good	Ego vere satis bene
i think that you people did	Puto hoc vos homines fecit
I can do so little	Non possum tam parum
You can't.	Non potes.
It can't be done now.	Fieri nunc non potest.
I was alone, my face was	Solus eram, vultus erat
I love you so much so much	Tam te amo tam
Yes, but it was great.	Etiam sed erat magna.
I always wanted to do	Semper volui facere
Can't understand anything.	Non potest aliquid intelligere.
I see a lot of things.	Multum video.
He did so, because he knew only what to do.	Ita fecit, quod solum facere sciebat.
I could not work very well	Non potui non opus est valde bene
That is not true.	Quod non est.
I can't see that myself	Non possum videre quod ipse
I didn't tell you.	Non dixi tibi.
I do not yet know.	Nondum scio.
I have been here today.	Hic ego hodie fui.
I think it is a lot	Puto esse multum
To be very happy	Ut sit amet ipsum
That it may or may not be good, but it has been said.	Ut vel non sit bonum, sed dictum est.
Not the first time.	Non primum.
There is nothing in him.	Nihil est in se.
I am thinking about everything in the morning	Ego sum cogitas omnia mane
I can't talk about it yet	Non possum dicere de illo adhuc
I can't think	Non possum cogitare
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I didn't know this	Ego nesciebam hoc,
I have.	Habeo.
I knew you were.	Sciebam te esse.
Now it's not mine.	Iam non est meum.
But I do not doubt this.	Verum hoc non dubito.
And now you have one better for yourself.	Nunc melius te quoque unum habes.
Not much to do today	Non multum facere hodie
He did what he could.	Fecit, quod potuit.
That's how to do it yourself.	Ut id quam ipsum.
In the end it was too much.	Tandem nimium fuit.
I have seen you here a lot	Vidi hic multum
You call me to it.	Tu me ad eam.
This is the first time.	Hoc est primum.
Which indeed is not.	Quod quidem non est.
You do not want.	Non vis.
In cum enim.	In cum enim.
Nothing for you.	Nihil tibi.
I was so ready	Ita paratus eram
I see what no one else can	Video quid aliud nemo potest
Now he wants who he is.	Nunc velit quis est.
The day is today.	Dies autem est hodie.
It does me pretty well.	Mihi satis bene habet.
But that's none.	Sed id nulla.
Yes, that was great.	Etiam id magna erat.
I can't see what's coming	Non possum videre quid suus 'venire
I have a lot to deal with lately	Ego multum agere cum nuper
But I see you	Verum ego video te
I need to get away from everything	Mihi opus est ut ab omnibus
I can't say what to do or not to do	Non possum dicere quid facere vel non facere
I wanted this to be	Hoc volui ut essem
It is possible to get out.	Fieri potest, ut ex.
I can't see it	Ego non video eam
I think it was probably me	Puto esse verisimile me
I told you who knows everything	Dixi vobis quae scit omnia
I thought, this is me	Cogitavi, hoc est mihi
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
I thought something	Cogitavi aliquid
Which would be better.	Quod melius esset.
I'm there to see it	Ibi sum videre eam
But it is necessary to speak great things.	Sed magna necesse est loqui.
I could not do without you	Non potui sine te
I am happy to help you	Ego felix adiuvare vos
This was the case;	Hoc ita se habuit;
I didn't want to come here at all	Nolui venire huc omnino
And it was done.	Factum est autem.
i don't want to know.	scire nolo.
I could not sit like us	Non potui nobis similis sit
And he could not do this.	Et de hoc facere non potuit.
But somehow nothing has been done much.	Sed nescio quo modo nihil multum factum est.
But this was not done.	Sed hoc non est factum.
I feel nothing at all	Nihil omnino sentio
through the house.	Per domum.
I know what you think of me	Scio quid cogitas de me
Yes that was good.	Ita quod erat bonum.
I don't know what he means.	Quid sibi velit nescio.
Maybe he thought you were.	Forsitan putabat te esse.
I tried too hard.	Conatus sum difficile.
I need to go to work	Mihi opus est ire ad opus
I could see all day	Videre potui totum diem
Make sure you see me.	Vide fac me.
All right, very well.	Recte, optime.
I think about you a lot	Puto te multum
I could not sit.	Non potui sit.
I want my child to live	Volo puer meus vivere
I think the same thing here.	Idem hic puto.
I don't like to do	Non placet facere
I don't know whether it is so who knows	Nescio an ita sit quis scit
he already knew.	iam sciebat.
It is probable.	Probabile est.
I did what I could myself.	Feci quod ipse potui.
He said this.	Hoc dixit.
I completely forgot the time.	Omnino oblitus sum temporis.
I need to get out of there	Mihi opus est ut ex ibi
I want to do that for fun	Volo facere ut amet
But it was not before.	Sed non erat ante.
Not too soon.	Nec cito.
And something else.	Et aliquid aliud.
To never do something	Ut numquam aliquid
I can't stay here much longer	Hic manere non possum multo diutius
I love her.	Hanc ego amo.
I have this kind of work	Hoc opus habeo, genus
It's all and nothing.	Est omnia et nihil.
What he did to him.	Quod ei fecit.
I wanted him to be with me	Ut eum mecum volui
She seemed kind.	Illa genus videbatur .
Certainly not.	Certe non.
But that never happened.	Sed id numquam.
Which indeed has been done.	Quod quidem factum est.
But I don't need to stop.	Sed prohibere non opus est.
Nothing too bad.	Nihil etiam mali.
Just like to talk.	Sicut loqui amo.
I don't think that	Non videtur ei quod
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
never say this!	numquam id!.
How much it is for me.	Quantum sit mihi.
I think we're kind of wrong.	Genus nos mali puto esse.
But it is possible.	Sed fieri potest.
I didn't know what this meant	Ego nesciebam quid hoc esset
If not.	Nisi non.
But he knew that this was not going to happen.	Sed sciebat hoc non futurum esse.
Now she is getting out of here.	Nunc de eo hic questus est.
He wanted more.	Plus vellet.
I'm not sure what you meant.	Certus sum quid vellet.
I know it is difficult	Scio esse difficile
I can't do that work	Non possum facere ut opus sit
I think I know that too	Scire puto quod etiam
I can do everything for you	Non possum facere omnia tibi
And I will not tell you what I am his name.	Nec dicam tibi quod nomen eius sum.
I didn't want to get anything from him	Ego noluit accipere aliquid ex eo
I saw my father again	Vidi pater meus, iterum
You can go home now.	Nunc domum ire potes.
Maybe it won't be so young.	Sic forte puer non erit.
I was told you'd probably be here this morning	Dictum est mihi hic esse velis probabiliter hic mane
Now there is no one to talk to.	Nunc loqui nemo est.
So not too bad.	Ita non etiam malum.
I have seen it happen.	Fieri vidi.
I didn't do it	Ego non feci eum
A must-for-all!.	A, debet, pro omnibus !.
There is only	Non est tantum
Trying to talk.	Loqui conatur.
You definitely stop by.	Certus es prohibere a.
I believe not, but	Non credo, sed
I am happy with how things went	Ego felix per quam res abiit
He didn't want to go.	Noluit ire.
I don't know what to say	Non scio quid me dicam
I didn't know what was wrong	Ego nesciebam quod esset malum
Which he left.	Quam ille reliquit.
What a man can't believe	Quod homo non potest credere
I need to know everything	Mihi opus est scire omnia
I'd like to say.	Libet dicere .

He did not know what it was, but he did.	Nesciebat quid esset, sed faceret.
I didn't know what this meant	Nesciebam quid hoc esset
Now I know this.	Nunc id scio.
That was not him.	Ut non erat ipsum.
I could see the plan	Non potui videre consilium
I didn't know what could be done	Nesciebam quod fieri posset

I'm not sorry for that	Non me paenitet quod
I knew about you but	Sciebam de te, sed
I also know how sure you are	Ego quoque scio quam certus sis

He is one and only.	Unus et solus est.
I could talk to him	Non potui loqui ei

I'm just there to help her.	Modo ibi sum ut eam adiuvet.

I hope that's how it meets you.	Spero quod occurrit quomodo.

That's just good.	Sic tantum bonum.
I would like to travel in time	Vellem iter per tempus
Which indeed is not what he says.	Quod quidem non est illud quod dicit.
I think he knew	Puto quod sciebat
I want the truth.	verum volo.
I had to see you	Ego quoque ad vos
Or perhaps it was too much.	Vel forte nimium fuit.
It is.	Sic est.
Certainly he can say nothing to you.	Certe nihil tibi dicere potest.
I would like to do the same	Idem facere vellem

I am ready.	Paratus sum.
Time to take me	Ut tempus mihi

I never thought you'd come	Numquam cogitavi velis venire
It seems that I can't help	Videtur quod non possum adiuvare
I can't tell you exactly what started	Non possum dicere quod prorsus incepit
That was his work.	Quod eius opus erat.
I am ready when you are	Ego paratus sum cum es
Unless, if not,	Nisi, nisi, nisi.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
Not enough to know.	Nec satis est scire.
I thought very well	Putavi valde bene
I don't feel anything else	Non sentio aliud
And this is almost a lot.	Et hoc fere multum est.

I do not doubt.	Non dubito.

I like it with that.	Placet id cum id.
But that's never going to happen.	Sed ut numquam enim.
It could be anything.	Posset esse aliquid.
It's good for me.	Mihi bonum est.
Never let a child with her	Numquam puer cum suo
I will try this	Ego hoc probabile
I can't get it.	Non possum hoc accipere.
I like me	Ego ut mecum

don't go after it	Non ire post eam
The thing is still there.	Res adhuc ibi est.
I probably need it	Ego probabiliter opus sit
But he could not do this.	Sed hoc facere non potuit.
I like talking about her.	Placet de eius.
I heard him coming after me	Audivi eum venire post me

I like to live on my own now	Mihi placet vivere in mea nunc
I know where you are	Ego scio ubi es

I like it a lot.	Multum ei placet.
I tried to get out of it	Conatus sum ut ex eo

I think maybe I should do this now	Puto fortasse hoc nunc facere
I could not do it alone	Solus facere non potui
As we all are.	Sicut nos omnes sumus.

At least he thought.	Certe putabat.
Don't even see.	Ne vide quidem.
Maybe it is so.	Fortasse ita est.

What I can give you	Quod tibi dare possum
I still feel like I'm not ready yet.	Adhuc sentio amo nondum paratus est.

It is likely that this is the way to go.	Probabile est hoc iter.

I certainly didn't want to	Ego certe noluit
No one saw him.	Nemo eum vidit.
But we have not this question.	Sed hanc quaestionem non habemus.

I told him not to come home	Dixi se non venire domum

I want to do the things	Volo facere quae

It was OK by me.	Bene a me fuit.
I had to stop	Habui ut me prohibere
I told him probably not	Dixi ei verisimile non esse
I can't say how long.	Non possum dicere quam diu.
This was his way.	Hoc eius modo fuit.
I know what you've done	Scio quid feceris
But let's be more than that.	Sed sit amet quam quam.
That's where he came from.	Id ubi venit.
I was more than ready to do it	Plus quam paratus essem habere eam facere

There is no such thing as none.	Nulla ut nulla enim.
I am so happy with it.	Tam felix cum illo sum.
I need as much as possible	Mihi opus est ut quantum fieri potest
I just don't believe that	Ego iustus non credere quod
Perhaps he did.	Fecit fortasse.
It seemed he was really here with me.	Vere videbatur hic mecum erat.
I'm glad to see you all here.	Gaudeo te hic omnes videre.
But it is the same.	Sed dictum est ipsum.
There is. 	Ibi est. 
a.	a.
Which is this.	Quod hoc est.
I didn't know what to do	Nesciebam quid faceret
Everyone says so.	Ita omnes dicit.
you must go.	ire debes.

Maybe not today.	Fortasse non hodie.
Maybe there is none.	Aliquam non est nulla.
i never heard him play.	numquam eum ludere audivi.
I did mine too.	Meum quoque feci.
You are absolutely.	Omnino es.
It was a great thing.	Res magna erat.
I feel the same way	Sic quoque sentio
This is happening to me	Mihi hoc fieri
I didn't know	Non me scivi
Finally left it behind	Tandem reliquit eam post
It could not be done	Fieri non potuit
I hope that's my problem	Spero quod mihi quaestio
You don't look good.	Non vide sis bonum.
About what I love.	De eo quod amo.
It's going to be okay.	Bene futurum est.
It is before.	Est ante.
I can't go on like this	Non possum sic ire
I know, see you as one.	Scio, te vide ut unum.
I need to hear it	Mihi opus est eum audire
Well, it is time.	Bene, tempus sit.
It is not.	Non est.
Must have been something.	Fuisse aliquid necesse est.
I know what you've done	Scio quid feceris
I need it.	Mihi opus erat.
Look soon.	Vide mox.
I didn't forget something	Oblitus non sum aliquid
I'm afraid you're not good	Vereor ne sis bonus
He said that he would do everything.	Omnia dixit se esse facturum.
which I think is true.	quod verum puto.
And I can see why	Et videre potest quare
Was .	Erat .
I just don't have enough	Ego iustus non satis est
We're there again.	Ibi iterum sumus.
You know what I mean.	Scis quid velit.
I'm not even there	Ego ne ibi quidem
Too hard to hear.	Nimis difficile est audire.
I think you know where this is going	Puto te scire ubi hoc eat
I will if you like	Ego, si libet
I knew him too well	Sciebam eum nimium bene
It was certain that I was going to do it.	Certum est me facturum fuisse.
I won't do it tonight	Non faciam hac nocte
This was not too bad.	Hoc etiam malum non fuit.
I can't make a decision now	Non possum facere consilium nunc
That's not right.	Quod non recte.
I'm always the same	Ego semper idem
This is not going to work.	Hoc non est facturus.
He said that he had to do it.	Dixit se habere et facere.
He could do nothing.	Nihil potuit.
Totally love!.	Prorsus amo!.
With reference to.	Cum ad.
He will be.	Ipse erit.
I don't mean to be that way	Non vult esse illuc
I can't say how	Non possum dicere quomodo
I know what you are thinking	Scio quid cogitas
But it is not true.	Sed non est verum.
If not, no.	Si non, non.
Nothing is better.	Nihil est melius.
I just want to see him.	Ego iustus volo eum videre.
You mean great things.	Magna vis.
not what to do	Non id quod facere
I only do so much	Ego tantum facere tantum
If not, do it.	Si non est, fac.
You have to know this.	Scire hoc habes.
I love that little guy	Amo ut parum guy
I'm not sure	Ego certe non sum
There is no help.	Auxilium non est.
But he would not.	Noluit autem.
He is no longer my teacher.	Non iam magister meus est.
I heard about you, you know	audivi de te, tu scis
What really happened is hard to know.	Quod vere factum est, difficile est scire.
I don't have time for this	Non tempus hoc
He doesn't have to talk.	Loqui non habet.
Really good breakfast, people.	Vere bonum prandium, homines.
But man has more.	Sed homo plus habet.
Very sorry.	Valde paenitet.
Or perhaps not.	Vel fortasse non.
It is likely you will never see him again.	Verisimile est, numquam eum iterum videre.
This is	Hoc est.
It was easy to see out.	Facile erat videre e.
I am absolutely nothing wrong	Omnino sum nihil mali
I don't do that.	Non facere.
I don't need to get the job done.	Non opus est ut officium feci.
I think we just see great things from him	Puto nos iustus videre magna ab eo
He is almost a man.	Fere homo est.
But you know who knows.	Sed scis, qui scit.
It is very good of you.	Is est valde bonus ex te.
You have all day.	Habes totum diem.
He told me not to go.	Dixit mihi non ire.
And there are about that.	Et sunt ut.
It is also a very happy time.	Etiam sit amet tempus ipsum.
I hope you understand it	Spero te intelligere illud
I wanted you to know everything	Volui te scire omnia
Well, really.	Bene, vere.
I knew there was money in it	Sciebam in eo pecuniam esse
I wanted to know what and why and how	Volui scire quid et quare et quomodo
I still do something but well	Ego tamen aliquid sed bene
No one knew for sure.	Nemo certe scivit.
Nothing has been there for a long time.	Nihil ibi diu.
It's going to be better for you.	Melius tibi futurum est.
I could not do it.	Non potui facere.
I couldn't get more wrong.	Non potui plus mali.
It didn't take long to find it.	Non diu eam invenire.
i want in.	volo in.
But some.	Sed aliquam.
You can say whatever you want.	Dicere potes quod vis.
I thought it was fun	Putavi sit amet
We are all.	Omnes sumus.
but he did not give.	tamen non dedit.
if you live.	si vivere.
I knew that I was here	Sciebam quod eram hic
It was all for him.	Totum ei erat.
and yet.	et adhuc.
I didn't know who	Ego nesciebam quis
This is not really true.	Hoc non est vere verum.
I don't want it gone too long	Non vis eam nimium diu abiit
What I could say	Quid potui dicere
I won't ever say that again, you know	Ego non semper quod iterum, tu scis
That's not for me.	Quod non pro me.
It was looking good	Non erat bonum vultus
I see nothing why not	Nihil video cur non
He didn't understand what he meant.	Non intellexit quid vellet.
I see you if you do the same.	Ego te, si idem feceris.
No one ever understood better than himself.	Nemo umquam melius quam ipse intellexit.
I love him, she thought.	Eum amo, putavit.
I thought about it too.	Cogitavi etiam de illo.
never do it again.	numquam iterum faciam.
No one knows.	Nemo scit.
And with everything to me	Et cum omnia ad me
I can't believe this guy	Hoc guy non possum credere
He didn't seem to listen.	Audire non videbatur.
I tried to find something to do with my day	Conatus sum invenire aliquid facere cum dies
This morning was a good time.	Hoc mane tempus bonum esset.
i want to go now.	ire nunc volo.
I want to hear about this	Volo audire de hoc
This one is.	Hoc unum est.
what could have been wrong?.	Quid enim mali potuit ?.
I am the one.	unus ego sum.
But one thing was certain.	Sed unum certum erat.
We don't need anything to do.	Non opus est nobis aliquid facere.
I knew what it was	Sciebam quid esset
And he saw now.	Et vidit nunc.
But he is a man.	Sed homo est.
All of it.	Ex eo omnes.
He was unable to do this.	Hoc facere non erat.
Have I not seen him?	Annon ego illum vidi.
badly done.	male factum est.
I can't say exactly what	Non possum dicere prorsus quod
I don't even plan to do that	Non quidem cogitas facere quod
I don't want to hear	Non vis audire
Do something for me, man.	Fac a me aliquid, homo.
You can't go.	Non potes ire.
This is your journey.	Tuum est iter.
I just didn't know what it was	Ego iustus nesciebam quid esset
I like all these things	Ego ut haec omnia
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
You are all home.	Vos omnes domum.
I hope you are a great man	Spero te, vir et res magna est
I know you very well	Scio te optime
I thought it would be like everything.	Putavi fore ut omnia.
Make sure to get out of it	Fac ut ex eo
He knew him really well.	Sciebat eum vere bene.
Or it was.	Vel erat.
Certainly you'd like it.	Certe id velis.
How great was it	Ut magna erat
But he could not think to say anything.	Sed non potuit cogitare aliquid dicere.
He said to him.	Dixit ei.
It's not much.	Non multum est.
I'll tell you how it was done.	Dicam quomodo factum est.
Or all three.	Vel tres omnes.
Which is well true.	Quod bene verum sit.
In this way.	Eo modo.
I hope you're well	Spero te bene
I can't do it now	Non possum iam facere
I just can't do this anymore	Modo non potest hoc facere amplius
But he no longer looks at it.	Verum iam non spectat.
She couldn't see me anymore.	Me iam videre non posset.
I really want to live here.	Vere hic vivere volo.
I totally love you	Ego prorsus amo mea
I'm late to be home	Ego nuper esse domi
Never without you	Numquam sine te
It's not necessary, really.	Non est necesse, vere.
it looks very good.	valde videtur.
But he was here.	Sed hic erat.
I see everything in it.	Video omnia in eo.
But that is how.	Sed id est quam.
i never wanted to know.	numquam scire volui.
I can't speak.	Nec possum dicere.
We can speak for the best.	Ad melius possumus dicere.
I don't think of it like that	Non cogitare de illo sicut quod
I can't get away from him	Non possum ab eo
I'd like to think.	Libet cogitare.
I really can't help it	Ego vere non possum illum
I know what's wrong with that car	Scio quid mali quod currus fuit
I don't even want to think about it	Non quidem volo cogitare de illo
Well, it wasn't.	Bene, non erat.
Maybe that was from.	Aliquam id erat ex.
It's time to save that.	Aliquam id nisi quam.
he was unwilling to go, and this was.	ire nolebat, et hoc erat.
It was mine now.	Meum nunc erat.
This is certain.	Hoc est certum.
Whether you like it or not.	Vel vis vel non.
I don't know much	Ego non multum
This could be me.	Posset hoc me esse.
I don't want to believe anything.	Nolo quicquam credere.
I've never seen her before.	Nunquam ante eam vidi.
I'm not here to make friends	Non sum hic facere amicos
I want to hear them all	Volo audire omnes
To her house.	Ad eam domum.
That's what this is.	Id quod hic est.
I don't work all day	Ego non opus totum diem
It is too much.	Nimium est.
He is the same.	Idem ipse.
I hope that you have something to help you.	Spero autem quod habes ut adiuvet te.
I didn't think so.	Non putabam.
I don't know what you mean about it for sure.	Nescio quid sit de illa pro certo.
I can be a good man for it	Non possum esse vir bonus ad eam
Probably said something or something else.	Probabiliter dixit aliquid vel aliud.
This was not true.	Hoc non erat verum.
This is my job.	Hoc est officium meum.
I appreciate all your help	Ut bene omnia auxilium tuum
I knew an attempt	Sciebam esse conatus
I hope to see you next year.	Spero te videre proximo anno.
I believe that's what you said	Id credo quod dixisti
I hope all is well.	Spero omnes bene.
And it's still enough.	Et adhuc satis est.
But he was here.	Sed hic erat.
It does me pretty well.	Is mihi satis bene facit.
You are here.	Hic es tu.
I can't talk to anyone about it	Non possum loqui quis de illo
I know hard to understand	Scio difficile intelligere
You know what about me.	Scis enim de me.
I need to go back in the morning again	Ire debeo mane iterum
I never saw anything like this	Numquam vidi aliquid simile hoc
You are ready by that time.	Paratus es eo tempore.
No but only what.	Nulla sed nisi quam.
Maybe there was no time.	Aliquam nec tempus erat.
Well, this one comes to mind.	Bene, id unum mihi occurrit.
There was no fun.	Nulla sit amet nulla erat.
I haven't thought of this before	Hoc ante non cogitavi
I thought you were okay	Cogitavi sunt bene
Don't buy anyone else anything	Non emere quis aliud quicquam
I really don't think much of it	Ego vere non multum cogitare eam
That's still a plan.	Id tamen consilium est.
I'll tell you this far	Dicam te mihi huc usque
I see this a lot	Hoc video multum
I don't want my race.	Nolo mihi genus.
never, ever again.	numquam, umquam iterum.
i think that's where it was from	Puto quod ubi fuit de
without me you have enough.	sine me satis habes.
I couldn't stop talking about you	Non potui prohibere de te
I didn't want to talk to him either	Nolui loqui ei vel
But not right.	Sed non recte.
But we are nothing.	Sed nihil sumus.
I would never do it.	Nunquam feceris.
This was the plan.	Hoc consilium fuit.
I've never been lucky to have one job	Ego numquam felix ad unum officium
Perhaps we should.	Forsitan si nos.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
I knew something there	Sciebam quod ibi
I heard him speak later	Audivi eum loqui post
And the story is said to be great.	Aliquam et dictum magna.
I choose you	Libet tibi
It's not too good.	Non nimium bonum est.
I didn't see one coming	Non vidi unum venire
Not him, but.	Non eum, sed.
This man had all that he wanted.	Hic habuit omnia quae voluit.
Her father wasn't much at home.	Pater eius non erat multum domi.
I was sure.	Certus eram.
It was not like that.	Non erat similis.
nothing else to do, nothing to live	nihil aliud facere, nihil vivere
He just told me what he wanted me to do.	Tantum dixit mihi quid me facere vellet.
I'm not ready	Paratus non sum
I just want you to think about this	Modo volo te cogitare de hoc
I just can't do this	Ego iustus non potest hoc
It should also be.	Sit etiam.
But he did not give.	Sed non dedit.
Attempts to achieve success	Conatus res tandem potuit
I thought you'd stay up	Cogitavi velis manere usque
Soon enough again.	Satis mox iterum.
I could not make it	Non potui eam
And that's the same thing.	Et id ipsum.
I don't think that	Ego non videtur quod
There was no need for anything else.	Aliud opus non fuit.
But that didn't work well.	Sed id parum bene.
I see what you want	Video quid velis
The shipment was that.	In sit amet erat quam.
I don't need anyone	Non opus est mihi quis
I can't be the only one who knows	Non possum solus qui scit
I really forgot the day	Ego vere oblitus diem
And he made his decision.	Et fecit consilium eius.
You can do it this way.	Hic modo id facere potes.
No, not.	Non, non.
So perhaps there could be a problem with that.	Ita fortasse quaestio de illo esse potuit.
I have to listen to him.	Eum habeo audire ei.
Which indeed is not.	Quod quidem non est.
It can be difficult.	Non potest esse difficile.
I really want to be single	Ego vere vis esse unum
I'm not ready.	Non sum paratus.
I meant to tell you yesterday	Dicere volui tibi heri
He could not believe.	Credere non potuit.
I know you better than	Scio te melius quam
I have something for you too.	Habeo etiam ad te aliquid.
I'm just here before lunch e	Ego iustus hic ante prandium e
I travel a lot of work	Ego multum opus iter
He did not wish to do so.	Facere non voluit.
He has no money.	Pecuniam non habet.
I can tell you this.	Hoc tibi dicere possum.
I want you and you want me too	Volo te et vis me quoque
I know you have a job to do	Scio te habere officium facere
.	, .
This is not exactly the case.	Prorsus hoc non ita est.
I could understand	Intelligere potui
I don't know what the problem is.	Nescio quid sit quaestio.
and I saw.	et vidi.
He doesn't want to say what to do	Non vult dicere quid facere
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum enim.
He could not help her.	Non potuit eam adiuvare.
I hope it's done for her	Spero autem quod factum est ad eam
I have absolutely nothing to say about this	De hoc omnino nihil habeo dicere
He wanted to go.	Ire voluit.
She thought it was pretty good.	Putavit satis bonum esse.
I thought to do	Cogitavi ut faceret
I hope we can stay up	Spero nos posse manere dicit
But that was how.	Sed id erat quam.
I'm there, not here	Ego ibi, non hic
I can't do this for me	Non possum hoc facere me
But at length the situation is so that it could not be better.	Sed tandem res ita se habet ut melius fieri non possit.
And never to.	Et ut numquam.
I can't do this anymore	Non possum hoc facere amplius
It was not too hard.	Non nimis difficile erat.
I didn't know what it was	Nesciebam quid esset
He said yes.	Dixit etiam.
That was it.	Id erat.
has, has.	habet, habet.
I haven't heard from you	Non audivi a te
We don't need it.	Nobis non opus est.
He doesn't know me.	Non scit me.
This could not be done if there was nothing in you.	Quod non posset fieri, si nihil esset in te.
I wanted to see this.	hoc videre volui.
He had no time.	Nec tempus habuit.
I believe that	Ego credo quod
I need to go and talk with her.	Ire debeo et loqui cum illa .
He was not sure why.	Cur non erat certus.
Better than a little.	Melius quam parum.
I want you to understand a little	Volo te intelligere parum
I can't believe I have you	Non possum credere te habeo
Which indeed is so.	Quod quidem ita est.
He said that this was one thing.	Unum hoc opus esse dixit.
Don't think too much.	Noli nimis cogitare.
I wasn't quite sure about that.	Non satis certus eram quod.
I can't do it myself	Non possum facere me
I know what will happen and probably will	Scio quid futurum sit et probabiliter erit
There is.	Ibi est.
He made the first room, which was easy.	Primum cubiculum fecit, quod facile erat.
It could not be done now.	Fieri non potuit nunc.
He willed.	Voluit.
I never wanted anyone like this	Numquam volui quis sic
I don't believe you either.	Non credo vel.
But it is well.	Sed bene est.
All I can do is work"	Omnia possum facere quod suus 'opus'
I think it's too much.	Puto nimium esse.
He has not.	Non habet.
He would not say this.	Noluit hoc dicere.
I knew he wasn't coming to me	Sciebam se non venire ad me
You'll never see me	Numquam videre mea
I really did feel like a child.	Ego vere feci sicut puer sentio.
Would you like to help.	Adiuvare velis.
I have something for this	Habeo aliquid hoc
I want us to be together now	Volo enim nos esse simul nunc
I want something to be good	Volo aliquid bonum esse
So forgot.	Ita oblitus.
If you have one, great.	Si unum, magna.
You don't talk to him	Et non loqui ei
It is not likely to have said so	Verisimile non est ita dixisse
I know you've done better	Scio, te melius fecisse
He said the only thing he could think of.	Dixit solum rem dicere posse cogitare.
I can see.	Videre possum.
Nothing was already resolved.	Nihil iam certus erat.
I can't think of anything else	Non possum cogitare aliquid aliud
I often thought about you	Saepe cogitavi de vobis
Someone wants to believe that it is so	Velit aliquis credere quod ita est
It's going to be like him.	Futurum est ut ipsum.
I was ut	Eram ut
not very bad.	Non admodum malum.
I didn't want anyone easy on me	Nolui quis facile me
And that's what I'm doing	Ego quoque id quod facere
But that was said.	Sed id dictum erat.
I see too well what it is	Video nimium bene quid sit
It can't be like this.	Non potest hoc esse simile.
but it will be one day.	sed unus dies erit.
I couldn't stop doing it	Non potui me facere prohibere
You can be a teacher.	Tu magister esse potes.
I knew nothing better	Nihil melius scivi
Even now I can feel it	Etiam nunc possum sentio
This is absolutely correct.	Hoc omnino recte.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum est.
Too much occurred.	Nimium occurrit.
I see what's going to happen to me	Video quid mihi futurum sit
I know more than	Scio plus est
i think she does a good job	Puto non est bonum eius officium
That's not what to do.	Quod facere non est.
Not yesterday.	Non heri.
I made her look	Ego feci vultus eius
I heard you're home	Audivi te in domum suam
Yes it was mine.	Etiam mea erat.
But it was not so.	Ita tamen non fuit.
Id.	Id.
I just hope you love me	Ego iustus spero te amo me
I never got why so much in it	Numquam obtinuit cur ita in eam
I know what he wants to do	Scio quid velit facere
Nothing could be done well.	Nihil bene potuit.
Say something you want.	Dicam aliquid ei vis.
Well too bad.	Bene etiam malum.
i don't know yet.	nescio adhuc.
I could not find	Non potui invenire
And perhaps that is good.	Et fortasse id bonum est.
I have seen this happening so far	Hoc ita futurum vidi
I know that it is.	id esse scio.
Always tell the truth	Semper verum dicere
As of now, it is not possible.	Ut nunc, fieri non potest.
This has just started to do.	Hoc modo incepit facere.
I could not leave you	Non potui te relinquere
Well, I believe it will do	Bene, credo, facturus est
It will never be better.	Nunquam melius erit.
I was there too.	Ibi etiam fui.
She looks so good on her face.	Et vultus eius tam bonus est vultus.
But we are not here to speak of him.	Sed hic non sumus de illo loqui.
he did not know what, and why.	nesciebat quid, quare.
don't have time for something	Non tempus aliquid
I don't think they know what has happened yet.	Non puto se scire quid adhuc factum sit.
I knew what he meant but	Sciebam quid vellet, sed
And got it.	Et obtinuit eam.
No one wants to talk about this.	Nemo de hoc loqui vult.
I knew something bad was going to happen this morning	Sciebam quid mali esset futurum hoc mane
No not.	Nec non.
I never ever wanted to do	Numquam semper volui facere
The man who saw it may live again	Vir qui vidit forte iterum vivere
You.	Vos.
Nothing will be done	Nihil autem fieri
I wish I could go with me	Vellem posset ire mecum
It is so easy to understand.	Tam facile est intelligere.
I wanted this too	Hoc volui nimis
So it's up to me.	Ita factum est ut mecum.
Even not until now.	Etiam non quam nunc.
I have seen your work already	Vidi opus tuum iam
It was morning.	Mane erat.
What you want.	Quod vis.
I just couldn't understand.	Modo nescire.
You'll never see him again	Numquam videre eum iterum

I couldn't get him	Non potui ut eum
I have no money, never money	Non habeo pecuniam, pecuniam, numquam
That's what he wants.	Ut id enim velit.
I tried not to think	Conatus sum non cogitare
That's not right.	Quod non recte.
I told her that	Et non indicavit ei quod
It was getting one.	Questus fuit unus.
Never think much before	Numquam cogitare multo ante
I still think he likes it	Ego tamen cogitare vult eam
However, he does very well.	Tamen optime facit.
He said to me.	Dixit mihi.
I need to ask me	Mihi opus est ut a mea
I can't be certain.	Certum esse non possum.
I love them all.	omnes amo.
I just don't have time	Ego iustus non in tempore

He also wants it.	Etiam id velit.
I don't want to live there	Non vis vivere ibi
Same with you all.	Idem cum omnibus vobis.
I have done a lot of harm.	Multum mali feci.

I don't do much here.	Non multum hic facio.
Or it may be.	Vel ut sit.
I don't want one.	Non vult unum.
But he said this one thing.	Sed hoc aliud dixit.
This is not even a name.	Hoc ne nomen quidem est.
I just wanted to know	Ego iustus vellem scire
And you are that	Et vos esse quod
I like to talk to you	Mihi placet loqui ad vos
Now I see what is a little more.	Nunc video quid sit paulo amplius.

But not all are bad.	Sed non omnes mali.

That's how that's how.	Ut id quam quam.
There will never be.	Non numquam erit.
He is who and what we are.	Is est qui et quod sumus.
And what to do with it	Et quod ad eam
This will not be better.	Melius hic non erit.
He can do what he wants.	Potest quod vult.
I think to see where this is going	Puto te videre ubi hoc eat
But so it is necessary.	Sed sic est necesse est.
And he did it.	Et fecit.
I know not enough.	Parum scio.
But there can be only one thing or more than that.	Sed potest esse tantum aliud vel plus quam illud.
I need to talk to her	Mihi opus est loqui ad eam
Its not where we are.	Eius non quo sumus.
I can't do this	Hoc facere non possum
I tried to talk about you	Conatus sum loqui de te
He thought something else too.	Putabat aliud quoque.
I am what you want to be	Ego quod vis esse
You can't really win.	Vere vincere non potes.
To me it is nothing.	Mihi nihil est.
he said that he did not know.	dixit se nescire.
I don't know what it will be, but it will be something.	Nescio quid erit, sed erit aliquid.
I have it if you want	Habeo, si velit
I've done a job for you	Et factum est officium ad vos
That's a lot of fun.	Ut sit amet dictum est.
I can't believe this really happens to me	Hoc mihi vere fieri non possum credere
We can't stop this one.	Hoc unum prohibere possumus.
I hope it comes soon	Spero mox venit
Perhaps that was true.	Forsitan id verum fuit.
I wanted to stay there.	ibi manere volui.
From there.	Ab est.
The father did not make me.	Pater non me fecit.

It is not so.	Non ita est.
But not in all.	Sed non in omnibus.
never got to say	Numquam obtinuit dicere
This class is very good.	Hoc genus est valde.
Probably too soon.	Verisimiliter etiam mox.
And you know which one.	Et scis quod unum.
There is more here.	Plus est hic.
I couldn't believe what he said	Non potui credere quod dixit
Don't ask me.	Non a me.
I don't see anymore.	non iam video.
I just don't see anyone.	Modo ne quis te videre.
you said.	dixisti.
That's what I'll do.	Id faciam.
I still know.	adhuc scio.
Maybe that's not great.	Aliquam id nisi magna.
I'm going home at last	Nunc domum tandem
He speaks of us.	De nobis loquitur.
And he was there.	Erat autem ibi.
This is very good.	Is est valde.
Not the first time indeed.	Non primum quidem.
one has to be.	unum habet esse.

I will tell him about you.	Dicam ei de te.
I just haven't had you before.	Modo ante te non habuit.
I don't know what's wrong with me	Nescio quid mali me
We are of this kind.	Hoc genus sumus.

I don't want anyone else	Nolo quis aliud
I like it even more	Mihi placet quod etiam plus

I want to live on my own	Volo vivere in mea
I have plenty of time to listen	Ego multa tempus audire
I was not ready, but he	non paratus essem, sed ille
Tell yourself in.	Dic te in.
To or not	Ut vel non
He wasn't sure why, but he did.	Non certus erat quare, sed fecit.
I would not hear.	Nolui audire.
I plan to come after you	Cogitavi venire post te
I appreciate your help	Ut bene auxilium tuum
It appears to be necessary.	Videtur opus esse.
I tried so hard to help you	Conatus sum ita ut tibi
i never heard him speak of that time.	numquam eum audivi loqui de illo tempore.
This is so easy.	Hoc tam facile.
But no one seems to speak of this.	Sed de hoc nemo loqui videtur.
His work has been done here.	Eius opus hic factum est.
Yes it is from him.	Ita est ab illo.
I didn't know what it was	Ego nesciebam quid esset
Doesn't look so good.	Non vultus bonus.
I never thought it would be	Numquam putavi fore
Never want to leave	Numquam vis relinquere
Not only me, but you.	Non me solum, sed te.
I was not there yet.	Non adhuc ibi eram.
I've never heard of him	Ego nunquam audivi ex eo
now we are.	nunc sumus.
But it was not difficult.	Sed non erat difficile.
I guess that's where it is.	Suspicor id est ubi est.
I don't seem to know what to say.	Non videtur scire quid dicam.
It is more than that.	Plus est quam illud.
You don't need me	Non opus est mihi
I just didn't want to talk	Ego iustus noluit loqui
I could hear him give it to someone	Ego audire potui ei dare ad aliquem
I need to think about it.	Mihi opus est de hoc cogitare.
I didn't know what to do or say	Ego nesciebam quid facere vel dicere
Yes that's the same no.	Etiam id ipsum nulla.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
It is never good.	Numquam est bonum.
I never wanted to do it.	Numquam volui facere.
Maybe that's great.	Aliquam id magna.
I know they had to play it together.	Scio in eo ludere simul fuisse.
I did not know.	Nesciebam.
I wish you have a good time tomorrow	Volo te habere bonum tempus cras
This boy definitely knows what he wants.	Hic puer certus scit quid velit.
I also like to do it	Ego quoque placet facere illud

But nothing can be done.	Sed fieri nihil potest.
He wanted something else entirely.	Voluit omnino aliud.
not a lot of time.	Non multum temporis.
I don't want any of this	Non vis aliquo hoc
But see these things.	Sed haec vide.
I don't want to talk anymore	Nolo amplius loqui
That's where it occurred.	Id ubi occurrit.
He did so.	Ita fecit.
And apparently no work.	Et videtur nihil opus.
he thought.	putavit.
I just know these things	Ego iustus haec scire
He knows and does not know.	Scit et nescit.
And you are not.	Et non es.
I am so sorry to say	Ego sum ita paenitet dicere
I don't like either please.	Non ut vel velit.
A first of all	A primum omnia
First to him.	Primum ei.
I'm not sure	Non sum certus, vere
I have to do now	Habeo hoc facere nunc
I just need to want it	Ego iustus opus est velle illud
I know you all me	Scio te omnia me
But nothing was done.	Sed nihil factum est.
You don't want to be with me.	Non vis esse mecum.
He can do both.	Utrumque facere non potest.
He gave me everything.	Omnia mihi dedit.
He was helping me.	In auxilium mihi erat.
i love you so, so, so much	sic te amo, ita, tantum
I didn't know what to do with him	Ego nesciebam quid agere cum eo
All I can do for you you want to be	Omnia possum facere tibi vis fieri
Unless he was in it.	In id nisi erat.
It's fine.	Bene habet.
No you are not here.	Nulla non hic.
Better late than that.	Melius sero quam.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
Well done to me.	Mihi, bene factum.
But there is none at all.	Sed aliquam nulla est.
I know you all understand	Scio vos omnes intelligere
That is not possible.	Quod non potest.
After him	Post eum.
I guess not easy	Suspicor non facile
I am and will always be yours	Ego sum et semper tuum erit
He is in himself.	Ipse in se.
What was not said.	Quod non erat dictum.
This is one and one.	Hoc unum et unum est.
I don't like dog.	Non similis canis.
I couldn't say that	Non potui quod
I thought I was doing well	Putavi facere bene
I am ready.	Paratus sum .
I think it is a thing to do	Puto esse rem facere
You and me are what we are.	Tu et me sumus quod sumus.
Tomorrow was before	Cras in ante erat.
I could not help you before	Non potui tibi ante
Nothing is more fun than that.	Nulla sit amet quam ex.
I told him my father ut	Dixi ei pater ut
That's the only thing that matters.	Id ipsum solum.
I was just good gone	Fui sicut bonum abiit
I saw her, was with someone	Vidi eam, erat apud aliquem
I am ready to look for him	Paratus sum vultus eius
But I need it too.	Sed opus est mihi quoque.
Nothing else comes to mind here.	Hic aliud occurrit.
I probably did.	Probabiliter feci.
This has never been done before.	Hoc numquam ei ante factum est.
This is indeed good.	Hoc quidem bonum est.
I will tell him soon	Dicam ei cito
I haven't seen him lately	Non vidi illum nuper
Yes, as has been said.	Etiam ut dictum est.
I never met before.	Numquam ante occurrit.
I just couldn't believe it.	Modo credere non potuit.
He is not happy.	Felix non est.
You're too young.	Nimis puer es.
This was something else.	Hoc erat aliud.
I refused to accept it	Et noluit accipere eam
Do what you do.	Fac facias.
I know it can be enough	Scio eam satis esse posse
See whether he did well or not.	Vide utrum bene fecerit necne.
Perhaps you are.	Tu fortasse.
So that's one.	Ita ut 'unum'.
And better.	Et melius.
I wanted to be able to go often	Volui posse ire saepe
You are not.	Non es.
In the said time.	In dictum tempus dictum.
I know what you think best.	Scio quid tibi videtur optime.
No one among us.	Nemo inter nos.
Maybe I couldn't	Quod forte non potui
to feel it.	ut sentio.
Yes, please come out.	Etiam, velit ex.
I feel so happy and glad	Sentio tam felix et gaudeo
I feel what I feel	Sentio quod sentio
My husband is very sad.	Nimis vir meus est.
I could not see it.	Non potui videre eam.
It is bad enough.	Malum satis est.
I will definitely get more in the future	Ego certus plus in futurum
We can't do anything else.	Non possumus aliquid aliud.
I want to tell her that she did well	Volo dicere ei quod bene fecit
But I can't do it.	Sed facere non possum.
He is my boy.	Puer meus est.
He was certainly my dad.	Pater meus certe fuit ille.
I've never been like this	Ego numquam sic
We can't leave him there.	Non possumus eum ibi relinquere.
He thought to himself.	Putabat ille.
I will do what is done	Faciam quod factum est
It's good for you to go.	Bonum est tibi ire.
I thought to help you	Cogitavi ut adiuvet te
It was indeed.	Erat quidem.
Who is the man?	Quis homo.
It is true.	Verum est.
I know this has not been easy for you	Scio hoc tibi non facile fuisse
He did not do well.	Non fecit bene.
But I don't want to hear more about it.	Nolo tamen amplius de eo audire.
Really wants to hear from him there.	Velit audire vere ibi eum.
That was it.	Erat id.
no one can say this.	hoc dicere nemo potest.
If I can't help you don't get me	Si non possum tibi non me
Look where you are now.	Vide ubi nunc sis.
All right.	Omnia recte.
Thus he does.	Sic facit.
I didn't know who saw me	Ego nesciebam quis vidit me
The men are there.	Homines ibi.
This seems impossible.	Quod fieri posse videtur.
You said you wanted to.	Dixisti velle.
This is my journey.	Hoc est iter.
I wonder if this is about	Miror si hoc est de
did not meet.	Non occurrit.
I don't want to see this forever	Nolo hoc videre, semper
I thought about you often.	Cogitavi de te saepe.
But his counsel seemed to be necessary.	Sed consilium eius opus esse videbatur.
I told him not to chance	Dixi ei ne forte
He could not believe.	Credere non potuit.
He wanted almost anything.	Fere quicquam voluit.
But we do it	Sed nos eum facere
You do the work.	Facis opus.
I just want to do my job	Ego iustus volo ut faciam mihi officium
I'm absolutely happy	Sum omnino felix
I've never seen one before	Numquam vidi unum ante
Again sorry.	Iterum me paenitet.
You have done well.	Bene fecisti.
I never told you	Numquam ego dixi tibi
I don't want to see you like this	Nolo te videre me sic
Now I'm talking about myself.	Nunc ego de me.
I think that's a good thing	Puto quod vir bonus est
I don't want to go that way.	Nolo illuc ire.
Not very well now	Non admodum bene modo
I'm not sorry.	Non me paenitet.
I can't talk to you now	Non possum dicere tibi nunc
Don't talk to me again.	Noli mihi iterum dicere.
I knew it would be when I could	Sciebam fore, cum posset
I never had anyone like that.	Numquam quis ut erat.
That was great for us.	Magna nobis erat id.
would like to stop him.	vellem eum prohibere.
I've done the work today.	Ego hodie fecisti opus.
I have nothing to do	Nihil habeo facere
I get nothing else	Ego nihil aliud accipere
I wonder when someone loves me.	Miror, cum quis me amat.
It was one thing.	Erat unum.
I have time to travel to the future	Ego tempus iter ad futurum
I want this as badly as you	Volo hoc tam male quam tu
I knew what it was	Sciebam quid esset
I want it to be.	Volo eam esse.
That's what it is.	Id ut id est.
I wasn't sure already	Non eram certus iam
None of the above.	Nulla in dictum est.
I could tell the truth	Verum dicere potui
I have not seen.	Non vidi.
I hope all is well	Spero bene
He has to take good money.	Bene pecuniam accipere habet.
I could not think of it	Non potui cogitare de eo
but all of you.	sed omnes vos.
but not his work.	sed non opus suum.
And much more than you need.	Et multo plus quam debes.
just like you.	sicut tu.
It does not please.	Non placet.
I can't do anything else	Non possum facere quicquam aliud
I never thought it was going to happen	Numquam putavi futurum
I do my job.	officium meum facio.
I thought it was	Cogitavi esse
I'm doing nothing	Ego nihil facis
Never need it.	Nunquam opus est.
I wanted this one badly	Hoc unum male volui
It was a great time.	Tempus magna erat.
I knew where to find it.	Ibi sciebam eam invenire.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
Yes they are men.	Ita sunt homines.
It was my decision.	Meum fuit consilium.
From what is this .	Ex quo hoc .
It's something that we don't want to know.	Est aliquid quod nos scire non vis.
And perhaps not.	Et fortasse non.
I hope you are too.	Spero te quoque.
Maybe that was it.	Aliquam id erat.
I just want to talk to you.	Ego iustus volo tecum loqui.
I have seen everything.	Vidi omnia.
And it will not be.	Et non erit.
You can know.	Scire potes.
Today they are not.	Hodie non sunt.
Yes, that's how it is now.	Etiam id nunc quam.
It must have been.	Fuisse necesse est.
Or let him be honest.	Vel eius sit amet.
I'd like to see him have that way.	Libet videre illum habere illuc.
I need a lot of work	Mihi opus est multum opus est
Still not today.	Adhuc non hodie.
This is, see you, you have everything	Hoc est, vide te, omnia habes
I love you so much!.	Amo te tam multo!.
You're not there yet.	Non tamen ibi es.
I like thinking about you	Ego similis cogitas te
I'm still getting it.	Im 'etiam questus est.
He did not do this now.	Hoc nunc non fecit.
But as it is.	Sed ut est.
That is enough now.	Quod nunc satis sit.
I don't see her do that.	Non videre eam facere.
I don't want to be like this	Non vis fieri sic
I just don't want to.	Ut non velit.
You are doing well.	Bene facis.
I saw the day	Vidi in diem
But he knows nothing.	Sed nihil scit.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
I can barely even see the house	vix possum etiam videre domum
And rightly so.	Et recte.
I was sure you'd seen it	Certus eram tibi velis videri eam
I'm sure you know that one	Ego certe scis quod unum
I've seen him do it.	Ego illum vidi faciam.
But not sure if it was so.	Sed non certe si ita esset.
I know what you are.	Scio quid sis.
This was not enough.	Parum fuit hic.
You can't give it to me.	Non potes me dare.
I want something else	Volo aliquid aliud
What else is there for you to get the money for.	Quod non enim aliud est tibi pecuniam accipere.
I am really alone now	Ego vere solus nunc
But the time is right for him.	Sed tempus est ut ipsum.
I'm happy for him to come with us	Sum felix ad eum venire nobiscum
I wish you were here with me	Utinam hic mecum
Always the same	Semper idem
You do, you know.	Facis, scis.
I never even met my father	Numquam etiam occurrit pater
This is all we can say	Hoc est, omnia possumus dicere

I need you more than ever now	Mihi opus est tibi plus quam umquam nunc
It is never better.	Numquam melius.
I don't love you for years.	Non amo te per annos.
That's not to say he couldn't get there.	Non est dicere se illuc non posse.
And I don't like it.	Et non placet.
I certainly don't see coming	Ego certe non video venire
It is likely, probably.	Verisimile est, probabiliter.
I thought I would be	Putavi fore
I have to leave earlier.	Habeo ut ante quam relinquere.
i thought you were all this	Putabam te totum hoc
It's time and great.	Aliquam et magna est.
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
I could not think of any of it	Non potui cogitare de aliquo ex eo
I hope you can do something with it.	Spero te aliquid cum eo facere potes.
I didn't know who it was	Ego nesciebam quis esset
I would like to talk to him	Vellem loqui ei
It's like a man.	Est ut homo.
It is not great.	Non magna.
I want to do it	Ego volo facere
Maybe he wants you well.	Forsitan bene velit.
I only want to be with him	Tantum vis esse apud eum
Just didn't know what to do.	Iustus nesciebat quid.
But this is not so.	Sed hoc non est ita.
You'd like to know.	Scire velis.
I wanted nothing.	nihil volui.
I hope it comes.	Spero autem venit.
I can only speak with him, but nothing more.	cum eo modo loqui possum, sed nihil amplius.
No, not how it was.	Nulla non quam erat.
I've never been together	Ego numquam in unum
That was fine with me.	Quod bene apud me fuit.
I couldn't think of anything better	Non potui cogitare aliquid melius
Not just you.	Non modo tu.
I'm so sorry for that.	Paenitet me quod ita est.
I didn't know what	Nesciebam quid
I just didn't want to know.	Ego iustus noluit scire.
that is the future.	id est futurum.
You will be one.	Unus erit tibi.
I can see it a little better	Non possum videre eum paulo melius
I hope.	Spero.
Thirty-three in the morning.	Triginta tres mane sunt.
Maybe this has been done.	Forsitan id factum est.
asked the father.	quaesivit pater.
But who has it?	Sed quis habet.
Must have it.	Debet habere eam.
I am talking about it.	De id mihi.
I don't feel anymore.	Non sentio amplius.
What happened at this time.	Quod factum est in hoc tempore.
I didn't know if I was married	Ego nesciebam si uxorem
This was one thing.	Hoc unum erat.
I think it is the same with me and him.	Mecum et illum idem esse puto.
So it is.	Ita est.
The first time I had it for me	Primum pro me habui
He knows he needs to go.	Scit ire necesse est.
I could hear more	Non potui audire amplius
He did not say, but did not even say.	Non dixit, sed non etiam dixit.
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
I can't find anything else.	Ego aliud invenire potes.
They definitely thought.	Certo putavit.
It is very unlikely that someone wants to.	Valde probabile est aliquem velle.
I think that's true	Puto quod verum est
There was no that which was, nor as it was.	Nulla erat id quod erat, nec ut erat.
Really don't like to be who you are.	Vere non placet esse qui es.
i know how much i wanted you	Scio quantum voluit te
Something no one ever said to you.	Aliquid nemo umquam dixit tibi.
It's too good.	Nimis bonus est.
I can't say what it is.	Non possum dicere quid sit.
but today he had.	sed hodie habuit.
Soon it began again.	Mox iterum incepit.
He can't do this.	Hoc facere non potest.
It was good, though.	Bona erat, sed.
I just didn't know what it was.	Modo quid esset nesciebat.
Tell me how it was.	Dic ut erat.
I didn't want to play anymore.	Nolui ludere amplius.
The truth is good.	Verum est bonum.
I need to hear it again.	Opus est iterum audire.
I can't think of anything to do.	Non possum cogitare aliquid facere.
The car does what it wants.	Currus facit quod vult.
I could barely hear	Vix me audire potui
This was, this was to go.	Hoc erat, hoc erat ire.
I wish your family well	Volo tua bene
People are busy.	Homines occupatus sunt.
I knew when I was working	Sciebam cum opus esset
I wonder whether he loves me yet.	Miror tamen an amat.
I love mine.	Meum amo.
I can go with you	Non possum ire cum te
It is.	Est.
But no one but him.	Sed nemo ipsum nisi.
I could go all day	Ire potui totum diem
always did it for the first time	Semper fecit primum
But he did not come and did not come.	Sed non venit et non venit.
I see good things in you	Video bona in te
Your plan is not already	Iam consilium tuum non est.
but he knew enough.	sed satis scivit.
I said nothing to him.	Nihil ei dixi.

And that's one thing I'll never do.	Id autem unum facere numquam.
He does not act exactly the same way.	Ita prorsus non agit.
She asked me my name.	Rogavit me nomen meum.
That's true.	Ut quidem est.

What things can be.	Quae res potest esse.
I can't apologize enough	Non possum non paenitet tibi satis

I think this may help	Hoc puto ut adiuvet

However, it was done.	Tamen factum est.
I didn't know what happened to him	Nesciebam quid ei acciderit
Looks like it's at home.	Similis est domi.

I had to tell someone.	Dicere habui aliquem.
I didn't want to talk about it anymore	Nolui loqui de hoc amplius
I only know what a father is to me	Tantum scio quod pater ad me
I hope this is not true.	Hoc utinam non sit.
I think all of this is happening.	Hoc omnibus fieri puto.
I wanted to hear from you	Volui te audire a me
It could have been for me, but it was not.	Fuisse mihi potuit, sed non fuit.
I can't get work done	Non possum accipere opus est
Someone should say what it is	Debet aliquis dicere quid sit
Yesterday I could not find it	Heri non potui invenire
I have to go tonight	Habeo ire hac nocte
And he definitely did the job.	Et certo fecit officium.
I know how it's happened	scio quomodo acciderit
I could not do it now	Ne id nunc non potui
There is always in it.	Nulla in semper est.
It was time.	Tempus erat.
But certainly never.	Sed certe numquam.
But that's how it is.	Sed id quam ipsum.
From now on there is no problem	Ex hoc tempore nulla quaestio est
Almost everybody does.	Omnes fere facit.
He must do something about it soon.	De illo cito aliquid facere debet.
This is the only thing I have to do	Hoc solum habeo facere
To really do something about it.	Ut vere aliquid de illo.
I've already forgotten	Ego iam oblitus es
More than necessary to go.	Plus quam necesse est ire.
Only by chance he saw	Tantum forte vidit
I haven't seen him in three years	Non vidi eum per tres annos
It was similar.	Similis erat.
But here's another thing.	Sed hic aliud.
often I do.	saepe facio.
I don't know why it is so.	Cur ita sit nescio.
I thought you would be me	Putavi fore me
You can talk about me too.	De me quoque dicere potes.
I could not find the car	Non potui invenire currus
Maybe it was at the time.	Forte erat eo tempore.
Don't buy anything	Non emere aliquid
But also himself.	Sed et ipsum.
I wanted you to be what you are not	Volui te esse quod non es
I could see nothing.	nihil videre potui.
I see nothing in it.	Nihil video in eo.
And it seems that it is also good.	Et videtur, etiam illud bonum.
I think she thinks	Puto haec cogitat
The man refused to come alone.	Noluit homo solus venire.
I knew he was going to do it.	Sciebam se facturum esse.
Whether he will be or not, no one knows.	Utrum ille erit necne, nemo scit.
I need something else	Mihi opus est aliquid aliud
and again he saw.	& iterum vidit.
Can't go on, you know.	Ire non potest, scis.
I wasn't doing too much.	Non eram nimium facere.
I should probably do it	Probabiliter facere debeo
But that was great.	Ut sed magna erat.
Certainly he did not.	Certe non habuit.
I can't help.	Non possum adiuvare.
I don't do much.	Non multum faciam.
Someone had to get that money.	Ad quam pecuniam aliquis habuit.
He knew what was needed.	Sciebat quid opus esset.
And with respect to us.	Et quantum ad nos.
But we are not.	Nos autem non sumus.
I don't want to find	Nolo invenire
I could not do it	Non potui facere posse
he could see nothing more.	nihil amplius videre potuit.
I know what you will do	Scio quid facturus sit
I'll be like a father	Faciam ut pater
It seems very likely.	Verisimile videtur.
It was said tonight.	Hac nocte dictum est.
I want fun.	Volo amet.
I could never come home	Numquam potui venire in domum suam
Now I know I need him	Nunc scio eum opus
I knew what it was	Sciebam quid esset

What is?' 	Quid est?'
I do something else	Ego aliquid aliud

But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
I could not.	non potui.
i think someone got it	Puto aliquem obtinuit ei
Actually, really late.	Vere, vere sero.
I just want you home	Ego iustus volo vos in domum suam
that was also my plan.	id quoque consilium meum fuit.
I know in him	Scio in eo
Maybe one more than one.	Aliquam quis quam.
I don't see people too often.	Saepe etiam homines non video.
Tomorrow is not going to happen.	Cras non futurum est.
There's still something between us.	Esse adhuc aliquid inter nos.
That's where he was himself.	Ut in erat ipsum.

I need to be myself again	Mihi opus est ut ipse iterum

Nothing is there, nothing is there, nothing is there.	Nihil ibi est, nihil ibi est, nihil ibi esse.
A little hard to find	A parum difficile invenire
This time.	Hoc tempore.
I'll do it again.	Faciam illud.
I just want more	Non iustus volo plus
I can if you like	Non possum, si tibi placet
I hope it will be!	Spero fore ut id!.
Not much longer now.	Non multo iam nunc.
He's just a guy.	Hic iustus est guy.
It could be good, it could not be good.	Posset esse bonus, potuit non esse bonus.
I have done wrong	Feci malum
You do or you don't.	Facis vel non facis.
There was no need to talk to him.	Dicere ei opus erat.
That's the same thing that was said.	Ut id dictum ipsum.
He can give him as much money as he wants.	Tantum pecuniae quantum vult ei dare potest.
and to know why.	et scire quare.
but here it will be.	sed hic erit.
But he cannot see where he is.	Sed videre non potest ubi sit.
I only want help	Tantum volo auxilium
And how.	Et quam.
I can still neither can I	Non possum adhuc nec possum

He didn't even want to see anyone.	Noluit quidem videre aliquem.
I can't go on this	Hoc ire non possum

It is great to hear.	Magna sit audire.
I am everything myself	Omnia sum ipse

He was the kind of guy.	Erat autem genus guy.
I don't really want to get there	Non vere vis ut ibi

he did not say anything else.	aliud non dixit.
I know what you want.	Scio quod velis.
No one knows who it is.	Nemo scit quae sit.
I hope you all like	Spero omnes sicut
I don't know what this means	Nescio quid hoc modo

I was with him but not really there	Cum eo eram, sed non vere ibi
I told him that today	Dixi ei quod hodie
It may also be.	Vel potest esse.
I told him about my dad	Dixi ei de pater meus
It would definitely be.	Certus esset.

I have something to talk to you	Ego sum aliquid loqui tecum
I see what you want.	Video quid velis.
Best regards, everyone.	Optime, omnes.
I do the same.	Idem ego.
There is a lot wrong with that.	Est multum mali quod est.
I knew now what it was	Sciebam nunc quid esset

But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
I'm not yet ready to do it	Nondum facere paratus sum

I live with me	Ego vivere apud me
He is not here now.	Hic nunc non est.

And that's not much better.	Et quod ego non multo melius.
I think we can help you	Puto nos adiuvare vos
I haven't seen this one before	Non vidi ante hoc unum

I do great things	Ego magna quae facere
I have already done it.	Jam id feci.
He knows us.	Novit nos.
This is for you.	Hoc tibi.

Nothing is ever wrong	Nihil umquam mali
Which neither.	Quod nec.
You're ready to leave as soon as possible.	Te relinquere quam primum paratus sis.
I don't do this	Ego non hanc rem
I love that man	Amo ut homo
I have done this for you.	Hoc feci vobis.
Please tell me what you can do.	dic quaeso quid potes.
perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.	fortasse, fortasse, fortasse.
This is your advice to us.	Id ipsum nobis est hoc consilium tuum.
Say it's better now.	Dic modo melius est.

Now who he was.	Nunc quis erat erat.
I couldn't understand what was up to you	Non potui intelligere quod usque ad te

I had enough of you today.	Satis habui de te hodie.
But it was time to do so.	Sed aliquam tempus erat ut id.
I can't talk to you	Non possum dicere tibi
He knew he would never see him again.	Sciebat se numquam iterum videre.
They never are.	Numquam sunt.
I don't want to do so.	Nolo ita facere.
I thought what was said	Cogitavi quod dictum est
This was the man she didn't want to know too much about.	Hic erat vir de illa nimium scire nolebat.
Or something.	Vel rem.
But I suspect he does this a little better.	Suspicor autem hoc parum melius facit.
I wanted to do something, to do something	Aliquid facere volui, ut aliquid
I feel bad about it probably.	Malum de illo sentio probabiliter.
So it is.	Ita est.

I can't do it.	Sic facere non possum.
I have a plan to do	Habeo consilium facere

Which makes me wonder.	Quod me non miror.
I don't mean to sit	Non vult ut sit
Who was.	Quis, erat.
i feel pretty good.	satis bonum sentio.
She thought he was doing well.	Putavit se bene facere.
It has not been said.	Dictum dictum non.
But neither was it always.	Sed nec semper erat.
I am just one person	Ego iustus unus homo
I am sure about that one	Certus sum ut unum
but one morning.	sed unum mane.
I hope the future is going well	Spero futurum est ut bene

I didn't want to do it	Nolui facere
There was something wrong with him.	Aliquid mali ei fuit.

Too bad it has been done.	Nimis malum factum est.
I am getting used to it	Questus sum ad eam

It never is.	Numquam est.
Listening to you all.	Te omnes audire est.

He certainly got it.	Hoc certe obtinuit.
There is one thing for sure.	Certo unum est.
I respect the decision	Vereor consilium

I can't do anything I can't do	Non possum facere aliquid non potest
And this he did.	Et hoc fecit.
I haven't had this for so long	Hoc tam diu non habui

I have seen it too.	Vidi etiam.

He needs to make money.	Pecuniam facere debet.
He did not say.	Non dixit.

He wanted more, and probably not.	Plus voluit, et non verisimile.
but he was unwilling to remain there.	sed ibi manere nolebat.
That he did not do good.	Quod bonum non fecit.
If you do not do it, you do not.	Si non feceris, non facis.
I thought where it was.	Cogitavi ubi esset.
Now I could see what I see	Nunc videre potui quid videre
which I never knew.	quae numquam sciebam.

I've at least heard you already	Ego certe iam audivi
But this.	Sed hoc.

you three together.	vos tres in unum.

But this is one thing.	Sed hoc unum est.

If he does not act this year, he does not do this year.	Si hoc anno non agit, non hoc anno agit.
I will not say much about him here.	Non multa hic de illo dicam.
We can do nothing about it now.	De eo nunc nihil possumus facere.
I'm not the only one who looks right now.	Non sum solus qui nunc spectat.
He would not be here.	Noluit hic.
I could understand why	Cur intelligere potui
I just never seem to find time	Ego iustus numquam videtur invenire tempus
I'm quite busy lately	Satis occupatus sum ut nuper
I also was one and only.	Ego etiam unus et solus eram.

Yes that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum.
If anything happens.	Si quid acciderit.
I knew you'd do it	Sciebam tibi velis facere illud
You are just.	Iustus es.
It looks nothing like him	Is vultus nihil simile ei
I have something like you	Habeo tibi aliquid simile
He wanted to know why	Hoc scire voluit quare
I am happy with it after I got one.	Sum felix, ex eo post unum feci.

I can not.	Non possum non.
I can't do this.	Non possum hoc facere.
At the same time I have not seen, but you have	Simul non vidi, sed habes
I don't want to talk to you	Nolo tecum loqui
And not either.	Et non vel.
To feel very lonely	Ut sentio valde solum
I tried to help but refused	Conatus sum ei auxilium, sed noluit
I still can't do it	Ego tamen non faciam

That's how I am.	Id quam mihi.
Something better either.	Aliquid melius vel.
I didn't know if you'd have me	Ego nesciebam, si me habere velis

I know you want to speak	Scio te velle loqui
I never really thought it could happen	Numquam vere putavi fieri posse
That she did.	Id fecit.
i think i love him	Puto te amo illum
What to say is not mine.	Quid dicere non est meum.
I'm not sure where.	Ubi non sum certus.
There is no need to think quickly	Non opus est cito cogitare
He has done really well for me.	Is mihi vere bene fecit.
This has only been done.	Hoc solum factum est.
Maybe he knows something.	Fortasse aliquid novit.
I've heard everything	Audivi omnia
I certainly do so	Ego certe sic facio
I was still in school.	Adhuc in schola eram.
I'll tell you what to do.	Dicam quid facias.

I want to be with you when possible	Volo tecum esse, cum fieri potest

I didn't know it was going to be	Ego nesciebam sic futurum
I don't know of him	nescio ab eo
I didn't know what was going to happen	Ego nesciebam quid esset futurum
I wonder how the situation is	Miror quomodo se habet
I just want to be happy	Ego iustus volo ut felix sit

But neither was it always.	Sed nec semper erat.
I want to play with you more	Volo ludere cum te amplius
I don't see much behind it.	Multum post eam non video.
He does not have yet.	Non tamen habet.
I have one myself.	Habeo unum me.
This does not mean at all	Hoc omnino non vult
Time is not enough.	Tempus non est satis.
I wanted the money	Volui pecuniam
He was thirty-one.	Triginta unus erat.
To do to it	Ut faciam ut eam
This time he wanted to be seen by you.	Hoc tempore, voluit videri tibi.
and yet he does.	et tamen agit.
I will definitely do this again.	Certum hoc iterum faciam.
I know what I don't think right now	Scio quod nunc non videtur
and his dog.	et canem suum.
But it is not enough.	Sed parum est.
I do not know the name.	nomen nescio.
Tell me what you are doing.	Dic mihi quid facias.
I really didn't know what to do	Ego vere nesciebam quid facere
They definitely wish.	Certo velit.
I hope to get out of this	Spero ut ex quo
I hope all is well with you.	Spero bene tibi.
Yes it is possible.	Ita fieri potest.
I thought we have time	Cogitavi nos habere tempus
I saw you yesterday	Vidi heri
I need to think about it too	Mihi opus est cogitare de illo quoque
We can do it again.	Iterum facere possumus.
To help like this.	Adiuvare sic.

I know that I am.	Scio me esse.
I was so happy to see you	Fui ita felix ad vos

He could not.	Non potuit.
I can't believe.	Credere possum.
I thought you all know.	Putavi omnes scire.
Maybe a little.	Fortasse paulo.
It's time to get some.	Aliquam a aliquam est, ut.
It doesn't seem to come.	Non videtur venire.
That's very important.	Id ipsum sit amet.
So it is.	Ita est.
I can't find anything to do to stay busy	Non possum invenire aliquid facere manere occupatus
You can't win.	Vincere non potes.
I think it's time for us to go	Puto tempus ad nos ire
I really don't have.	Ego vere non habeo.
late in the afternoon again.	Sero post meridiem iterum.
I will say yes.	Dicam etiam.
There was no teacher	Ibi magister fuit
I was still there with him.	cum eo adhuc eram ibi.
I don't feel very well.	Non sentio optime.
Rightly indeed.	Recte quidem.
I could not time	Non potui tempore
I just want to be me	Ego iustus volo me esse
It was, just wasn't enough.	Erat, modo satis non erat.
Or in the office.	Vel in officium.
I know for sure where this has gone	Pro certo scio quo hoc modo abiit
I wanted it not to be	Volui eam non esse
He is very happy, though.	Sit amet ipsum, sed.
I hope all is well	Spero bene
Or to none.	Vel ut nulla.
And perhaps it has been too long.	Et fortasse nimis diu fuit.
But here it is.	Sed hic est.
He was not yet, but would be soon.	Nondum erat, sed fore et mox.
Or perhaps he knew it.	Vel forte sciebat.
All these things I have done	Haec omnia feci
Tonight is for us.	Hac nocte est pro nobis.
He was looking.	Vultus erat.
This is not true.	Hic non sit.
I think it's possible	Puto posse
It was the first time, which was the first time.	Tempus erat primum, quod erat primum.
I know you do it	Scio eam facis
There are also.	Sunt etiam.
I just need to be alone	Ego iustus opus ad esse solum
I thought you had to see him.	Putabam te habere eum vide.
But it is not the same.	Sed non est ipsum.
That which was made, was not so.	Quod factum est, ita non fuit.
I don't think it will ever be this bad	Non puto fore semper hoc malum
And so it is true.	Et ita verum est.
Maybe that was great.	Aliquam id erat magna.
I finally had enough	Me tandem satis habui
It seems to work at all.	Omnino opus videtur.
It seemed so long.	Tam diu videbatur.
Is good.	Bonus est.
Now you can't.	Nunc non potest.
It's time to say the same thing.	Aliquam id dictum ipsum.
This was in him.	Hoc erat in eo.
Maybe today, maybe not tomorrow.	Forsitan hodie, cras fortasse non.
I can see it.	Possum videre illud.
I can see in it quite well.	in eo satis bene videre possum.
You know that all is well.	Scis omnes sic bene se habere.
I don't want to believe this	Nolo hoc credere
I really like her ad	Ego vere similis eius ad
I like it a lot.	Multum placet.
That was always fun.	Ut sit amet semper erat.
Not the time to act	Non tempus agere
But this is not so.	Sed hoc non est ita.
That is one thing.	Unum est id.
I think this is for him	Puto hoc est pro eo
Maybe I'll do it too.	Forsitan id quoque faciam.
Which was done after us.	Quod post nos factum est.
I would like to say this	Vellem hoc dicere
I believe that I can do the same for you	Credo quod potest facere idem tibi
I was sure he would understand me	Certus eram se intelligere me
I think that he did right by us.	recte a nobis fecisse puto.
I didn't want or	Nolui, vel
Yes, always.	Etiam semper.
Is it me? 	Estne mihi?
she said.	illa dixit.
I thought it didn't work	Cogitavi non opus
It's not done.	Non est factum.
No one knows what they are.	Nemo scit quid sunt.
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla quam.
But not just his car.	Sed non solum currus eius.
I never wanted to be single	Numquam volui esse unum
That is not true here.	Quod hic verum non est.
To him as much as I could	Ad eum ut potui
I could not be enough	Non potui satis est
This is to see me	Hoc est videre me
He doesn't want to hear.	Non vult audire.
No one needs to know about it.	Nemo de illo scire opus est.
I want everything.	Volo enim omnia.
More than a child, it seems.	Plus quam puer, videtur.
Or he could not.	Vel non potuit.
Not enough today.	Non satis hodie.
I know you mean me too	Scio vis me quoque
Well, in the near future.	Bene, in proximo.
But it is in none.	Sed in nulla est.
I told you how it was	Dixi vobis quomodo esset
I'm not here for a long time	Ego hic non diu
He can do very well.	Optime potest.
I never thought he would do it.	Numquam putabat se facturum esse.
Tomorrow he was out.	Cras in erat ex.
I need help in order to be good to me	auxilium mihi opus est ut sit mihi bonum
He didn't understand what he said.	Non intellexit quid dixit.
I said what that was.	dixi quid id esset.
This class is mine.	Hoc genus est meum.
We are with me.	Apud me sumus.
At home they are very good.	Domi sunt valde bona.
I never really saw you before this or it was	Numquam vere vidi te ante hoc vel factum est
But no time now.	Sed nec tempus nunc.
And soon he realized that he had something.	Et mox intellexit se habere aliquid.
I'm not sure there	Ego certe non ibi
I love that too	Quod nimium amo
I never told him anything else and never asked	Numquam ei quid aliud et numquam quaesivit
I would do it this way.	Facerem hoc modo.
Everything's great to see.	Omnia magna ad.
I think I'm willing to accept	Puto me velle accipere
I don't want to do it again	Non vis ut faciam illud iterum
I don't really know what to do next	Non vere scire quid facere proximo
I was not alone in this.	Solus in hoc non fui.
It was already late.	Iam sero erat.
Now no one is good.	Nunc quis nulla bona.
For I am glad.	Gaudeo enim.
Usually this is not true.	Fere hoc verum non est.
He thinks he understands.	Putat se intelligere.
I do that almost every time.	Facio id fere tempus.
it is necessary.	opus est.
So here we are.	Ita hic sumus.
I want this not so true	Volo hoc non ita verum est
that was my plan.	id consilium meum fuit.
I didn't want to see him anymore	Nolui ut eum amplius
Id.	Id.
I'll fight for you all	Ego te pro omnibus
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
I had it all	Ego quoque illud
I'm doing anything	Me facere quicquam
He can almost do it.	Fere facere non potest.
I'm doing something	Me facere aliquid
But it is the best that can be done.	Sed optime fieri potest.
I am almost into it	Ego fere in eo
I have heard of this.	de hoc audivi.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
and got me	et obtinuit me.
I need to do something	Mihi opus est ut aliquid
For I am.	Ego enim.
he knows more.	plus novit.
But perhaps well.	Sed fortasse bene.
Yes, it is true.	Ita est, verum est.
I had something to say	Ego quoque aliquid dicere
Nothing else I could think of	Nihil aliud potui cogitare
Yes exactly right.	Ita prorsus recte.
Thus it is possible.	Ita potest.
I don't like anything.	Non aliquid simile.
I want you to stay here with me	Volo te hic manere apud me
There's a lot out there.	Nulla sit amet ex enim.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
which I doubt to be true.	quod verum esse dubito.
I never wanted you here	Numquam volui tibi hic
But not tonight.	Sed non hac nocte.
I think this is for you	Puto hoc in te
Absolutely love me.	Omnino amat.
We can see each other understand	Inter se intelligere possumus videre
No one said no.	Nulla quis dictum nulla.
I just don't have that	Ego iustus non habere quod
You can think.	Potes cogitare.
I want something like this	Volo aliquid simile hoc
I know you can do it	Scio te posse facere
You can't do much about this.	Non multum de hoc facere potes.
You have everything.	Habes omnia.
She hasn't seen me until now.	Illa me usque nunc non vidit.
I wanted to have time with him	Volui me tempus cum eo
So he can stay where he is.	Ita manere potest ubi est.
I just need to think	Ego iustus opus ad cogitare
I never did that in school	Numquam fecit ut in schola
Please believe.	Credere libet.
Make something if you have something.	Fac aliquid, si quid habes.
But he does not speak.	Sed non loquitur.
I feel bad.	Sentio malum.
You don't want to be without him	Non vis esse sine eo
I will always be.	Semper ego.
I would not know.	scire nolui.
Yes I don't like it.	Ita non placet.
To who you are.	Ut quis es.
It is possible, however.	Fieri tamen potest.
I can't believe what just happened	Non possum credere quod modo factum est
I had to deal with	Ego quoque agere cum
I don't think I can do it	Non puto posse facere
I am sure I have many things to say to you	Pro certo habeo tibi multa dicere
I wanted to stay together	Volui manere simul
This is where it all started	Haec ubi omnia incepit
I forgot all about it	Oblitus sum omnes de eo
It was in New Orleans.	Aliquam in est erat.
But that's no right now.	Sed id nulla nunc.
I don't want to live like this.	Nolo sic vivere.
Perhaps you are, perhaps you are not.	Forsitan es, fortasse non es.
Not right, however.	Non recte, tamen.
This is only.	Hic tantum est.
I was through him.	fui per eum.
He saw something.	Aliquid vidit.
I can't see it again	Non possum videre eam iterum

I just can't do it.	Modo id facere non potest.
I like home.	Mihi placet domi.
I just don't want to come to you.	Modo non vis venire ad te.

After this, he still wanted me.	Post haec, adhuc me voluit.
I want to be us.	Volo esse nos.
I could get something with me	Non potui accipere aliquid mecum
This is not working.	Hoc non est opus.

The next year or	Proximo anno an.
I just didn't know what to do	Ego iustus nesciebat quid de hoc facere
And so it was.	Et ita factum est.

I can't do that here	Non possum facere quod hic

I need to see you one more time	Mihi opus est videre unum tempus

Unless he did something.	Nisi aliquid fecerit.
I thought that	Cogitavi quod
I have one thing to do today	Habeo unum facere hodie

Nothing I didn't know.	Nihil ego nesciebam.
I was like this.	Sic eram.

To say again	Ut iterum dicere

I wanted to see her again	Iterum videre volui eam
I wanted to know if you would like to come with me	Scire volui, si vellem venire mecum

I know what I feel	Scio quid sit quod sentio
I know the house.	Novi domum.
I couldn't get more mali	Non potui plus mali

When this is so.	Quod cum ita sit.
At length he was ready.	Tandem paratus erat.
I could not see anything.	Aliquid videre non potui.
I think he knows something	Puto quod scit aliquid
I can't talk about it	Non possum dicere de eo
But you are not.	Sed non es.
This is the way to do it.	Hoc est iter facere.
Something else to think about.	Aliquid aliud cogitare.
I've heard it.	Audivi id.

Someone needed to talk.	Dicere aliquem opus erat.
I could do nothing more	Nihil amplius potui
This was to win	Hoc erat vincere
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
I know what you said to me	Scio quid dixisti mihi
At that time no.	In id tempus nulla.
I really believe in mine	Ego vere in mea
It doesn't have to be.	Non habet esse.
I'm afraid that's gonna be a good time.	Vereor ne tempus amet id.
Tonight and tonight too.	Hac nocte, et nocte etiam.
But not the same as that.	Sed non ipsum quam.
He wanted nothing more with her.	Nihil amplius cum illa voluit.
He is not going.	Non eat.
I've always wanted you	Ego te semper volui
Don't do it.	Noli id ​​esse.
I need to know if it's true	Mihi opus est scire, si verum est
I absolutely don't get what's happening	Ego omnino non id quod fieri
I don't mean to you.	Ut non sit tibi.
I couldn't hear it	Non potui me audire eam
They don't really exist.	Non vere sunt.
There was never a question about it.	Numquam quaestio de eo fuit.
No it's mine.	Nulla id est mea.
I don't need anything else from him	Non opus est aliud ab eo
But that was what it was.	Sed id erat erat.
I know what you mean now	Scio quid vis nunc
I'm sure it will be okay	Certum est me fore bene
He was a pretty good man.	Vir erat satis bonus.
I believe I could say	Tibi credere potui dicere
still with him.	Cum eo adhuc.
But that's how and why.	Sed id quam et enim.
Tomorrow I can talk it out more	Cras possum dicere eam amplius
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I just want to be with her.	Ego iustus volo esse cum illa.
This is not true.	Hoc verum non est.
I want to talk to her again	Volo eam loqui iterum
It doesn't seem to be	Non videtur quod fieri
I really mean this time.	Ego vere hoc tempus vult.
Maybe it was now.	Aliquam erat nunc.
He just couldn't do it.	Ille iustus facere non potuit.
I have three people with me	Habeo tres homines mecum
I'll do it.	Faciam.
Which certainly has not yet been done.	Quod certe nondum factum est.
I told you exactly what happened	Dixi vobis prorsus quod factum est
I know this is not always the way	Scio hoc modo non semper est
Nothing is like that.	Nihil est simile.
I could not see better than I could	Non potui melius videre quam potuit
that must be done.	Quod faciendum est.
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
He said her name.	Dixit ei nomen.
I thought	Cogitavi
I don't need to go now	Non opus est ut nunc
How great.	Quam magna.
I could not have it.	Id habere non potui.
I already told him what happened	Iam dixi ei quod factum est
So that.	Ita ut.
You have it for sure.	Pro certo habes.
He already knew.	Iam sciebat.
I was always here.	Hic semper fui.
It's time to do nothing.	Aliquam nec nulla.
And yet it is not enough to know it.	Et tamen non satis est id scire.
I need to get out of there	Mihi opus est ut ex ibi
I want to hear from you too	Volo etiam te audire
You don't want to give anything	Non vis dare quicquam
I love you and always will	Te amo et semper erit
He also wished he was there.	Etiam id velit erat.
He is not like today.	Ipse hodie non est similis.
It was much better.	Multo melius erat.
I know who the father is	Certe scio quis sit pater
I can help you with it.	Te adiuvare possum cum eo.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
It can still be here.	Potest tamen hic esse.
It does not please.	Non placet.
But sometimes it seems too bad.	Sed nimis nunc malum videtur.
You don't want it.	Non ita vis.
I have to persuade you to help	Habeo persuadere ad auxilium
Now she is three.	Iam tres est.
I had to stop and think	Habui prohibere et cogitare
They are evil men.	Homines mali sunt.

I think you are the same	Puto te idem
What did he do.	Quid ille fecerit.
So it is.	Ita est.
I can't find it	Non possum invenire eam
I don't doubt that I am alone	Non dubito quod solus
It won't be much.	Non multum erit.
I need to do	Mihi opus est facere
I knew everything I needed to know	Sciebam omnia scire opus
I know everything just by looking at you	Scio quae mox per vultus apud te
She's got what she wanted	Illa obtinuit quod voluit
We can't stop.	Non possumus prohibere.
We like to travel.	Iter nobis placet.
But I feel very good.	Sed me ipsum sentio bonum.
Someone has	Aliquis habet .
That's how it started.	Id quomodo hoc incepit.
I hope you're happy	Spero te sit amet
I am not.	Non sum ego.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I believe it's true he said	Suus 'credo verum dixit
He wants to get away from nothing.	Ut a nulla velit.
I'll tell you what time it is	Dicam tibi quod tempus est
It is to be done.	Sic faciendum est.
I can't talk anymore.	Non possum amplius dicere.
I'm sure you're up to it.	Certus sum te esse ad eam.
I did exactly that.	Prorsus feci.
But this one.	Sed hoc unum.
I can't be certain.	Certum esse non possum.
I hope we can do it next year	Spero possumus facere proximo anno
I have a job for you	Habeo officium pro vobis
He refused to go.	Ire noluit.
I need a little more time	Mihi opus est paulo plus temporis
Yes that's great.	Etiam id enim magna.
I hope this type is true.	Spero genus hoc verum est.
It is, it is.	Est, est.
It's about her.	De suo est.
That really isn't the best.	Quod vere non optime.
There was none at all.	Nulla a aliquam erat.
Will be.	Futurum esse.
I think you are too	Puto tu, etiam
You can see the one and only.	Unum, videre potes.
I'm happy but.	Sum felix, sed.
I can't do this.	Non possum hoc facere.
I bought something myself	Ego quod ipse emit
Now I know.	Nunc scio.
That was also yesterday.	Quod etiam heri.
And he could not speak.	Et loqui non potuit.
I will always believe you	Semper credo te
It's not you	Non est tibi
But this is so.	Hoc tamen ita est.
That's how to do it.	Id quam facere.
if only she could speak.	si modo posset eam loqui.
Not sure if this is good or not.	Nec certe si hoc bonum sit necne.
I'm never quite sure	Ego numquam satis certo
Next time who knows.	Proximo tempore, qui scit.
I don't need that car.	Non opus est ut currus.
sorry for that.	Paenitet me quod.
I know you don't exist	Scio te ipsum non esse
I just need a little time	Ego iustus opus paulo tempore
I knew we would never see him	Sciebam nos nunquam videre eum
After that I could make a decision	Post hoc consilium facere potui
Not in this way.	Non hoc modo.
What is certain at this time is from the next.	Quid hoc tempore certum sit ex proximo.
No one would do anything without it.	Id esse nemo aliquid sine.
This morning I need you	Hic mane opus est tibi
I can do it for you	Non possum facere vobis
You think it's true.	Putas verum est.
I am ready for the job	Ego paratus sum ad officium
I don't quite know how to say not so much.	Non satis scio dicere non ita esse.
I don't think it will be really hard	Non puto fore ut difficile vere
I'm not long gone	Ego non diu abiit

He can't do this.	Hoc facere non potest.
Persuasion is not easy.	Persuadere autem non facile.

All things now.	Omnia nunc res.
No, not some save.	Nulla non aliquam nisi.
You want to do something.	Facere aliquid vis.
I just want to do my time	Ego iustus volo ut faciam mihi in tempore
I just knew each other	Ego iustus scivi se
For he says.	Dicit enim.
I really want to do it.	Ego vere volo facere.
And it looks good.	Et bene videtur.
But as for him.	Sed ut ipsum enim.
There is no need to think only now	Non opus est nunc solum cogitare
Hardly him himself.	Ei vix ipsum.
To not save that.	Ut non nisi quam.
I know what else we are	Scio quid aliud sumus
This I know for sure.	Hoc certe scio.
I didn't want to do something	Nolui quid faceret
He knows, and so you owe him.	Scit, et sic debes.
But not right.	Sed non recte.
I'd like to travel but scroll.	Librum iter tamen libet.
He likes to do so.	Velit id.
I definitely tried.	Certus sum conatus.
I didn't want to see it	Nolui videre eam
Say his name.	Dic nomen eius.
But tell me what.	Sed dic quid.
I think she saw what she told me	Puto quod vidit non indicavit mihi
I don't believe anything in this.	Non credo quicquam hoc.
He likes to be.	Velit sit.
And not the same thing.	Nec id ipsum.
Not so much.	Non tantum.
I wanted to believe it.	Credere volui factum.
No, no, no.	Nulla nec quam.
I had fun doing it.	Habui amet facere.
For us all.	Pro nobis omnibus.

I have friends here	Ego habeo amicos hic
Please help!!!!,!,!.	Placet auxilium !!!,!,!.
I can't believe you can't see it here	Non possum credere te non videre eam hic
It's too big.	Nimis magna est.
There was never a father	Numquam erat pater
I need to know what happened	Mihi opus est scire quid factum est
I want to do this	Volo hoc facere
And he certainly did enough.	Et certe satis fecit.
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
It's still very good.	Optime adhuc est.
But none at all either.	Sed vel ipsum nulla.
I can't make it anymore	Non possum eam amplius
This is the same.	Hoc ipsum est.
You can't speak.	Non potes dicere.
In the morning, in the afternoon.	Mane, post meridiem.
But perhaps not.	Sed fortasse non.
That's a boy.	Sic puer.
This thing is which I never saw	Res hic est quam numquam vidit
I don't know what to do	Nescio quid facere
I must do this.	Hoc mihi faciendum est.
Why I could not understand	Cur non potui intelligere
This	Hoc.
I told you that it was	Dixi vobis quod esset
He likes to do something.	Velit aliquid.
yet he knew that he was not willing.	sciebat tamen se non velle.
Say you want to talk to her.	Dic vis ei loqui.
I will do all these things for you	Omnia haec faciam vobis
I only have to say it	Tantum habeo dicere ei
Or better, boy, do one.	Vel melius, puer fac unum.
I haven't seen one.	Non vidi unum.
I'm going to help you	Ego te ad auxilium
He does not come alone.	Solus non venit.
I really hope to come there one day	Ego vere spero venire ibi dies unus
Yes I told him we could leave as soon as possible	Etiam dixi ei nos simul posset relinquere
I'll never say it again.	Numquam iterum dicam.
But this is not necessary.	Sed hoc opus non est.
I never wanted to do either	Numquam volui facere vel
I've been for quite some time	Fui satis aliquo tempore
And he buys it.	Et emit eam.
I'm not always enough	Ego non semper satis
It can't be.	Non potest esse.
I can't say that much	Non possum dicere quod multum
I get what you want.	Ego id quod vis.
You can do it too.	Facere etiam potes.
My father thought what it was.	Pater meus quid esset, putavit.
It's not what's going to happen.	Non est id quod futurum est.
I don't think it would be	Non puto fore
I don't see why that is.	Non video cur id sit.
I'll see for you.	Et vide tibi.
I know who can help you with it	Scio qui adiuvet te cum illo
never did.	nunquam fecit.
I think it may be possible	Puto fortasse fieri potest
That was what we did.	Id erat quod nos.
I just want you	EGO iustus volo vos
Never take the time to do it	Numquam non accipere tempus ut faciam
I hope this will be time	Spero fore hoc tempore
I just didn't do it.	Modo id ei facere non.

Look at the time.	Vide in tempore.
This is the one who refused you.	Hic est qui te noluit.
I need to talk to someone.	Mihi opus est loqui ad aliquem.
Not long.	Non diu.
I do i like.	Facio mihi placet.
Man like me and you	Homo sicut me et te
The father does the same.	Idem facit pater.
I really don't want it	Ego vere non vis eam
And certainly it was enough.	Et certe satis fuit.
I don't know anything about you.	Nescio quid de te.
Something like this.	Aliquid simile hoc.
I tried not to think of time	Conatus sum non cogitare tempus
Always think about it	Semper cogitare de eo
I really need it	Ego vere opus est
I never even met a man	Numquam etiam occurrit homo
That's good to know.	Quod bonum est scire.
So perhaps it is.	Ita est fortasse.
i think something about it.	Puto quod de illo.
She doesn't even know me.	Illa ne me quidem novit.
I just don't say anything	Modo non dicere aliquid
I am good.	Ego bonus sum.

What have I done? 	Quid feci?
'nothing'.	'nihil'.
Never get loud.	Numquam magna ut.
Nothing else I can do	Nihil aliud possum facere
I just wanted to know	Ego iustus scire vellet
I hope the same for you	Spero idem tibi
But one thing.	Unum, sed.
That's not always the case.	Ut non semper erat.
I have that book with me	Ego autem illum librum mecum
Maybe any one out there.	Aliquam quis ex nulla.
You can't play.	Ludere non potes.
Now I'm a good boy.	Nunc puer bonus sum.
Well, I said, and it was	Bene, dixi, et erat
Maybe you know something, perhaps you don't.	Fortasse aliquid scis, fortasse non facis.
I know this about me	Hoc scio de me
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
What he wanted me to be here.	Quod me hic esse voluit.
He was now away from him.	Nunc a erat ipsum.
I know you can do this	Scio te hoc facere potes
I don't think I know anything.	Non puto aliquid scire.
I am sure he will do that.	Certus sum facturum esse.
But I've never seen it before.	Sed id numquam ante.
I'm just not sure how you'd like to do it all	Ego iustus non certus quomodo velis omnia agere
I can't believe that you are truly mine	Non possum credere quod es vere meus
I will do it	Ego faciam
Thought perhaps to be a man	Putavit fortasse esse quod homo
And we have it in us.	Et habemus id in nobis.
I can't do that to him	Non possum facere quod ei
This he certainly did.	Hoc certe fecit.
all in him.	omnes eum.
I have heard.	Audivi.
I told you that you were him again	Dixi vobis ut vos se iterum
I just didn't know what to do	Modo nesciebat quid esset facturus
I think that's what I do today.	Quod hodie facere puto.
I thought.	Cogitavi.
Some time, he said to himself	Aliquid temporis, dixit se
I thought you were someone	Cogitavi es aliquis
I will do this job for sure right now.	Pro certo nunc hoc faciam officium.
This is mine now	Haec est mea nunc
You talk to him.	Vos ei loqui.
It is not easy.	Non facile.
Why	Cur.
Nothing is.	Nihil est.
I only get one	Ego tantum ut una
There was no reason to do it.	Nihil erat cur id faceret.
I was lucky there.	Ibi felix fui.
i think someone	Puto aliquis
We have to talk to you.	Habemus de te loqui.
To sit at work at night	Ut sit opus nocte

It truly is.	Vere est.
yes who is it.	Etiam quis est.
I tried to stay at home and stay with him most of the time.	Conatus sum manere domi et plus temporis manere apud eum.
Easy for him	Facile eum
I always thought I was.	Semper putavi me esse.
Well, there you go.	Bene, ibi te.
After talking time.	Post tempus loquitur.
I was completely still	Omnino adhuc essem
You must be in him.	In illo esse debes.
Maybe one of us.	Forsitan unus ex nobis.
Now this is something.	Iam hoc aliquid est.
I think it's going to happen.	Puto futurum.
And there was a lot of work to do	Et erat multum opus facere
I didn't know what it was	Ego nesciebam quid esset
I hope to be very happy	Spero fore ut sit amet ipsum
I need something more	Mihi opus est plus aliquid
The situation is the same.	Sic se res habet.
I could not do it myself	Non potui me facere
Not much.	Non multum.
But you did very well.	Sed tu optime fecisti.
You don't need me to always tell you what to do.	Non opus est mihi semper tibi dicere quid facias.
Look at your dog.	Canem tuum vide.
I can see nothing in it.	Nihil in eo videre possum.
I want something for you	Volo aliquid quod pro te

I haven't done it one time	Non feci unum tempus
There is something new.	Non est aliquid novi.
You didn't make it	Non fecisti eam
I'm really not too sure about this	Ego vere non nimium certus de hoc

He is gone with me.	Abiit mecum.
My book	Librum meum.
I just could	Ego iustus facere potui
You need to know more.	Plus debes scire.
I don't even know that	Non quidem scio quod

But not for long.	Sed non diu.
If so how?	Si quomodo?.

He is with us.	Nobiscum est.
I am sure that	Certus sum quod
I was happy to see you live	Felix eram videre vivere
I can't hear anything	Non possum audire aliquid
I go alone	Ego solus ire
Maybe not bad enough.	Forsitan male satis.
But the time is right.	Sed tempus ut est.

I see the things that are not	Video quae non sunt

I want to stay.	Volo manere.
I see nothing can be done now.	Nihil nunc fieri posse video.
I would do it, but it is not my job	facerem, sed non est officium meum

I know what it looks like	Scio quid is vultus amo
I won't stop loving you.	Ego vos non prohibere.
I have you tonight	Ego habeo vobis hac nocte

It would seem that this is true.	Videtur quod hoc verum sit.
I think you say yes	Puto tu etiam dicere
It is.	Sic est.
He seemed to believe what he said.	Credere videbatur quod dixit.
i think i need her time	Puto opus eius tempore
I can't stay here longer	Non possum hic manere diutius
That seems to be the plan.	Quod videtur esse consilium.

I knew what happened there	Sciebam quod factum est ibi
Don't be yourself.	Noli esse tibi.
I didn't want to leave it behind	Nolui relinquere me post eam
It does a very good job.	Facit officium valde bonum.

At length he understood.	Tandem intellexit.
Better than she thought.	Melius non putavit.
I want you to do this	Volo te facere, fac
Yes this is.	Ita hoc est.
I didn't know about any of this	Ego nesciebam de aliquo hoc
Do this one thing.	Hoc unum facias.
I don't know how he did it, but he did it.	Nescio quomodo fecerit, sed fecit.
Not anything more	Nec quicquam amplius
And here's how you can do it.	Hic est quomodo id quoque facere potes.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.

I see a lot of things.	Multum video.
It will not be.	Non erit.
I'm not the only one doing this to me.	Im 'non solum hoc mihi facis.
I'm afraid of going home	Vereor vere domum

It's time and great.	Aliquam et magna est.
I just need to listen.	Modo audire debeo.
I hope yours are as good as mine	Spero tuum tam bonum quod meum est
I tried it on	Conatus sum in eo
He could do a lot, though.	Multum potuit, sed.

Too easy.	Nimis facile.
I can't say who he is	Non possum dicere quis est
I made a name yesterday.	Ego heri nomen feci.

I think you can hear me	Puto me audire potes
It is not good to do.	Non est bonum facere.

That was it.	Id erat.
I don't want anything else	Nolo aliud
I haven't seen her here, but	Non eam hic vidi, sed
I want it all to me this morning	Volo eam omnes ad me hoc mane
This has nothing to do with it.	Hoc nihil est ad illud.
Yes, but a great time.	Etiam sed tempus magna.

I am still today	Ego sum usque hodie
I am really happy with it	Ego sum vere felix ad eam
I know her better now	Scio eam melius nunc

I don't need any help	Non opus est aliquo auxilio
But there	Sed ibi.
I'm not getting her for that one	Ego non questus eius quod unum

I tried hard to do just that	Conatus sum difficile facere sicut quod
Well, no more.	Bene, non amplius.
I really don't know why it was done	Ego vere nescio quare id factum est

I want you wrong, but not right	Volo te malum, sed non recte
I wasn't sure about this	Non eram certus de hoc
I saw what I was doing	Vidi quid facerem

But he refused to accept it.	Sed accipere noluit.
I knew it was looking so good	Sciebam vultus et non erat bonum
I know it won't be easy	Scio non esse facile
I just couldn't at that time	Modo non potuit in illo tempore
I also didn't know what was here	Ego quoque nesciebam quid hic esset
I don't know why	nescio cur
Something similar.	Simile quid.
I knew this was coming	Hoc sciebam venire
I want to believe what we can believe	Volo credere quod possumus credere ei

But we need more.	Tamen plus nobis opus est.
Will definitely order again.	Certum ut iterum.
I see you at home	Video te domi fecit
I couldn't speak to him either	Non potui dicere ei vel
that was the plan.	id consilium fuit.
I was there for him	Ibi eum essem
I believe this to be the case.	Id ita esse credo.
I just didn't want to talk to him anymore	Ego iustus noluit loqui ei amplius
I don't need to know.	Non opus est scire.
I said nothing.	Nihil dixi.
I hope it will be.	Spero fore.
yes it doesn't work.	Etiam non opus.
But none of this is the same.	Id ipsum nulla sed.
I really should see someone	Ego vere debet videre aliquem
So you too.	Sic et vos.

You have to do that.	Quod tibi faciendum est.
I just want to talk to him.	EGO iustus volo loqui ei.
I can't stop myself	Non possum me prohibere
It is good.	Bene est.
Just take a look at yourself.	Vide modo de te.
Which he did not.	Quod non fecit.
But this is not yet.	Sed hoc nondum est.
It's not how it is.	Etiam non quam est.
I can't be what I mean	Non possum non esse quod vult
I don't know exactly what.	Nescio quid prorsus.
I had to tell someone.	Dicere habui aliquem.
There is nothing behind it.	Nihil est post illud.
It was not the first time.	Non erat primum.
I know she did	Scio eam rem fecit
Ever since school.	Ex quo schola.
Maybe right	Fortasse recte
we are happy and happy.	felix et felix sumus.
He could have done that as a boy.	Fieri potuit ut ille puer.
I want him to stop too	Volo eum prohibere etiam
I saw you for days.	Vidi te dies.
It's fine.	Bene habet.
Now	Nunc,.
He didn't want to see anyone now	Noluit videre quis nunc
I can't, truly	Non possum, vere
He makes sure.	Certum facit.
That is.	Id est.
I have to make lunch	Habeo facere prandium
I just want to get away from it	Ego iustus volo ut ab eo
I don't need to do that.	Non opus est facere.
We can do nothing more.	Nihil plus possumus.
I often think about it here	Saepe huc cogitare de eius
He would do it first.	Primum id facturum esse.
But you.	Sed tu.
There was just not enough time.	Non modo satis temporis erat.
This was easy.	Hoc facile erat.
One day just gone.	Una die iustus abiit.
To love yourself.	Te ipsum ad.
At least three men.	Vel tres homines.
Mine did too.	Meus quoque fecit.
I'd like to know where you are.	Libet scire ubi sis.
It is likely that this could be done.	Verisimile est id fieri posse.
I knew it was different	Sciebam aliud esse
Where is my mom from when she was.	Ubi id est meum, ex quo erat.
I think that's all you can say	Puto quod de omnibus potes dicere
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum est.
I had to make sure that it was true	Ego quoque fac quod verum esset
good to hear.	bonus audire.
But also himself.	Sed et ipsum.
If it was not.	Si non erat.
And he was ill-willed.	Et male voluit.
I knew he wasn't coming anymore	Sciebam se non amplius venire
She was going to give him a name.	Illa sibi nomen facturus erat.
I can just take it easy	Non possum iustus accipere facile
I really do something for you	Ego vere faciam tibi aliquid
There was something about her	Fuit aliquid de suo
But he is not in it.	Sed non est in.
I wanted my lunch	Prandium meum volui
I didn't think this	Non putavi hoc
He did not know that he was there.	Nesciebat ibi esse.
But not only.	Sed non nisi.
I could not	Ego non potui
I wish I were out of it"	Utinam mihi ex eo "

I want to know more about this happening	Volo scire de hoc fieri
I truly believe in him.	Vere credo in illo.
It is done.	Factum est.
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
We'll never go anywhere	Numquam huc ire sumus
You have done this before.	Hoc ante fecisti.
And today it was not.	Et hodie non fuit.
I wanted her home with me	Volui eam domum mecum
I don't know what that is.	Nescio quid id est.
But that was until now.	Sed id erat quam nunc.
But perhaps he could know.	Sed scire fortasse potuit.
Get everything for me	Ut omnia mihi
I want something more for you	Volo aliquid plus tibi
I'm just not ready	Ego iustus non paratus est
I could not understand what it was	Non potui intelligere quid esset
I hope all is well with you.	Spero quod bene tecum.

Someone said something.	Aliquis aliquid dixit.
She could do something.	Posset aliquid facere.
He was not here yet.	Hic adhuc non erat.
I thought it was a good name for us	Nomen nobis bonum esse putavi
That's what I tried to do.	Id mihi facere conatus est.
I could easily say that he is in me	Facile dicere potui, eum in me esse
But this is never, always true.	Sed hoc nunquam, semper verum est.
I know about everything	Scio de omnibus
I was there that day	Fui ibi die illo
I couldn't believe that you'd like something	Non potui credere quod simile aliquid velis
I just want to see it	Ego iustus volo video vidi illum
Which is indeed good.	Quod quidem bonum est.
Maybe only one.	Forte unus tantum.
Stay here.	Mane hic.
To be honest please.	Ut sit amet velit.
I never got into you	Numquam obtinuit in te
I will tell you this.	Dicam tibi hoc.
I've never been to him	Ego nunquam fuisse in eo
He said that he wanted to do it.	Dixit se velle facere.
Maybe it wasn't us.	Aliquam nec erat nobis.
I was here if I didn't know what I wanted.	Hic essem si nesciebam quid vellem.
But he has gone as far as he can.	Sed quantum in potest est abiit.
What you have done.	Quod fecisti.
I want to do it here	Volo facere hic
And again.	Et iterum.

I can't live like this.	Non possum sic vivere.
I forgot about time	Oblitus sum de tempore
I really like to be here	Ego vere amo ut hic
I'm not at home.	Non sum domi.
But there is little for this.	Sed ad hoc parum est.
You can go either way.	Et potest ire vel iter.
Now she has it all, perhaps not so much.	Nunc omnes habet, fortasse non tantum.
Maybe not for the man himself.	Aliquam non ipsum quis enim.
Make one thing different.	Aliud fac unum.
I think I should be	Puto me esse
I can be a good man for you.	Ego vir bonus esse potest tibi.
Still not going home.	Adhuc non domum.

I couldn't anymore	Non potui amplius
I don't want to know.	Nolo scio.
I guess you kind of do	Suspicor autem genus facere

That's the same thing now.	Id ipsum nunc.
To live in me is not enough.	Vivere in me non est satis.
I don't need to say it at all.	Non opus est omnino dicere.

I never want to see you	Numquam vis videre vos
If you want to do it, do it.	Si vis facere, fac.

Maybe for him.	Sibi fortasse.
I am the first one	Primum sum
There is not enough right about that.	Non satis recte est de illo.
I thought it would be time	Putavi fore tempus illud

But not really well.	Tamen non bene vere.
Men are men.	Homines homines sunt.
I couldn't do anything else	Non potui aliquid aliud
I think you better come in this afternoon	Puto te melius venire in hoc post meridiem
That's still happening.	Id adhuc fieri.
He was out of it.	Erat ex.
He would not say this.	Noluit hoc dicere.
I know too many things	Scio etiam multa
I knew enough	Sciebam satis
I believe you love me	Credo te amo me
You have done nothing.	Nihil fecisti.
Now you can even see.	Nunc quidem videre potes.
You are here, and you are not here.	Hic es, et hic non es.
I can barely see.	Vix videre possum.
Maybe you too.	Fortasse tu quoque.
It will not be fun, nor will it be easy.	Non sit amet, nec facile erit.
I just want to be here	Ego iustus volo hic esse
I could do it easily	Facile facere potui

I'm sure it was too much.	Ego certe eius nimium fui.
never with him	Numquam cum eo
I forgot to be here too	Oblitus sum etiam hic esse
I can't give it	Non possum dare eam
I'm driving the car today	Me agit currus hodie
I absolutely don't want to anymore	Ego omnino non vis amplius
I wasn't alone, we spent a lot of time	Solus non eram, nos multum
Now I need to know	Nunc opus est scire
Neither gender nor.	Nec genus nec.
That's only great.	Ut non nisi magna.
And it is not hard to find.	Et non est difficile invenire.
You can be yourself.	Te ipsum esse potes.
I was ready for that one	Paratus eram quod unum
Don't get sick.	Non male.
To save tomorrow	Cras ut nisi.
Perhaps this is true, she thought.	Fortasse hoc verum est, putavit.
You don't want to do something but talk to someone.	Non vis facere aliquid, sed loqui ad aliquem.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
If you don't want it, don't.	Si non vis, noli.
I want to see a little more of it	Volo videre paulo plus ex eo
I don't think what is happening	Non cogitas quid hoc fieri
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
I hope you understand this	Spero te hoc intelligere
I wanted to get everything in	Accipere volui omnia in
I heard this only years later.	Hoc solum audivi post annos.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
Which is so true.	Quod ita verum est.
I couldn't name someone	Nomen ab aliquo non potui
So it is.	Ita est.
I really like to be with you	Ego vere similis esse apud te
not a lot of time.	non multum temporis.
Nothing will happen here.	Nihil hic futurum est.
I like pretty much	Mihi placet satis multum
He was here, but now he was not.	Hic erat sed nunc non erat.
Today hasn't started well.	Hodie non bene incepit.
I think it is something else	Puto esse aliquid aliud
Good to hear.	Bonus audire.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
I just can't make it home tonight	Ego iustus nocte domum non eam
I know exactly not very well	Prorsus non valde bene novi
It is bad.	Malum est.
I still need to see how you do this.	Mihi adhuc opus est videre quomodo hoc facias.
It does not please.	Non placet.
He also wants.	Etiam velit.
You do this today.	Hoc hodie facis.
I can't deal with it	Non possum agere cum illo
This is not for you.	Non est hoc tibi.
There's no time for him.	Nulla nec tempus ipsum.
I'm doing this again	Haec iterum ego faciens
I didn't know what she meant.	Quid sibi vellet nesciebam.
Can't go home now.	Nunc domum ire potest.
I know what I want and for him	Scio quid volo et pro eo
I thought I told you	Cogitavi ut dixi vobis
What a father like.	Simile quid pater.
I want to travel.	Iter volo.
I just say something.	Modo aliquid dicere.
They both like it.	Ambo placet.
I can't do this anymore	Non possum hoc iam non
Or something else.	Vel aliquid aliud.
It was so.	Sic erat.
He says really happy.	Dicit vere felix.
And that's what happened at this time.	Id quod hoc quoque tempore factum est.
I will know you a little better	Ego autem scio te paulo melius
I've heard nothing like it at all.	Ego nihil omnino simile audivi.
I don't know where my husband is.	Nescio ubi vir meus est.
i don't know what to do	nescio quid faciam
I want to do that fro	Volo facere illuc
This is my plan.	Hoc est consilium meum.
I was, yes	Fui, etiam
Yes, it was not great.	Etiam non erat magna.
I have a question for you	Habeo quaestionem pro vobis
I am probably happy to say that	Ego probabiliter felix ad quod
As in before.	Ut in ante.
No i don't love it.	Non quod non sit amet.
I heard what happened yesterday, yes	Quid heri factum audivi, etiam
one thing for sure.	unum certe.
not by that.	Non eo.
I'm speaking the truth.	Ego aliquid verum loqui.
He wanted to go home soon.	Mox domum ire voluit.
I don't know what's better.	Nescio quid melius.
This could be great.	Posset hic magna.
I knew all along	Sciebam omnes per
so you can speak.	sic loqui potes.
I could see things are okay	Non potui videre quae sunt bene
I can't say what to do	Non possum dicere quid facere
I've never been there	Ego numquam ibi
I could live this	Hoc potui vivere
I'm not sure about that yet.	De illo tamen non sum certus.
He is a good boy.	Bonus puer est.
Except for one thing.	Nisi quis rem.
Yes I am with everyone.	Ita sum apud omnes.
Let it be so.	Sit sic.
Now I'm done.	Nunc ego feci.
It's so hard to see.	Suus ita difficile videre.
I have been.	Fui.
I am really sure that	Ego vere certus quod
I am actually a person	Ego quidem per se homo
I wanted to get it, right now here	Eam accipere volui, nunc hic
But who wants	Sed quis velit.
In a.	In a.
I don't see what	Ego non video quid
It is not likely.	Verisimile non est.
I didn't know what's wrong	Ego nesciebam quid mali
There, here.	Ibi, hic.
I did not do it.	non feci id.
i'm very good at this	Sum valde bonum hoc
I could not go anywhere	Non potui ire huc
Not done correctly	Non recte factum
I couldn't believe I could do this	Hoc facere non potui credere
But that has nothing to do with what is going to happen.	Sed id nihil ad id quod futurum est.
But these are pretty good.	Sed haec satis bona sunt.
You know him.	Scis eum.
For I was not there that night.	Non enim ibi nocte illa.
I wanted to do it myself.	ipse facere volui.
I can barely do it	Vix possum facere
I don't think it's true.	Non puto verum.
That is.	Quod est.
I know, it's still a little early.	Scio, parum adhuc mane est.
but never in order.	In numquam nisi ut.
But here	Sed hic.
I'm afraid of everything	Vereor ne omnia
If.	Quod si.
I am very sorry for this	Paenitet me hoc valde
Which one is the nearest.	Quae proxima est.
None but from him.	Nulla a ipsum nisi.
The day has come.	dies venit.
I just want you to know what	EGO iustus volo te scire quid
yes but i'm not out.	Etiam sed aliquam ex.
All men too.	Omnes etiam homines.
I think that's enough time	Puto quod nunc satis est
This one is.	Hoc unum est.
I can hardly believe me	Vix possum credere me
it looks like.	simile videtur.
I am very surprised	Valde miror
So much for what it is.	Tantum quid est.
I know you know this	hoc scio te scire
Something must be done about this.	De hoc aliquid faciendum est.
I still have it	Me tamen habere eam
I can see you know what you need	Non possum videre te scire quid opus sit
But there was no time.	Sed tempus nulla erat.
I really couldn't believe it.	Ego vere credere non potui.
Really really good.	Vere vere bonum est.
That can be.	Illud potest esse.
Look at what's happened.	Vide quid acciderit.
He refused to speak.	Noluit loqui.
So it is.	Ita est.
I was there and you know	ibi essem, et tu scis
There was none in there.	Nulla in erat enim.
He could think of nothing.	Nihil cogitare potuit.
I wish it were already	Utinam iam illud
I'm him soon if I were you.	Ego illum cito si te essem.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
I want to see you there	Volo videre te ibi
I believe you still have	Credo adhuc habet
You'll never know to say these things	Numquam scire haec dicere
I saw the future	Vidi futurum
I was really like that	Eram vere amo ut
I was just there for help	Fui sicut ibi auxilium
I didn't know how to do	Ego nesciebam quam facere
I know that	Ego scio quod
Someone to stop.	Aliquem prohibere.
not me again	Non me iterum
Now I see you do this	Nunc video te hoc facere
That's only a great idea.	Ut id magna nisi.
you can never know.	numquam scire potes.
I want to talk to him	Volo loqui ei
But this is not with you.	Sed hoc non sit apud te.
I could do it without help	Potui facere sine auxilio
It is important to take some time.	Aliquam sit amet aliquam est.
Now was the time.	Nunc tempus erat.
It was going to be bad.	Malum erat futurum.
But neither was it said.	Sed nec dictum est.
I wanted to see the whole thing	Totum videre volui
He doesn't want me.	Me non vult.
This was a little while ago.	Hoc paulo ante fuit.
I hope not or	Spero autem non vel
And he thinks it's good.	Et bonum esse putat.
I do the same.	Idem ego.
Maybe he can't hear or understand.	Fortasse non potest vel audire vel intelligere.
This is where you should be.	Hoc est, ubi debes esse.
But certainly there is need.	Sed certe opus est.
I have everything today.	Habeo omnia hodie.
I heard what you said.	Audivi quid dixisti.
Let's start here now.	Nunc hic sit amet.
I doubt much	Multum omnino dubito
We don't even talk.	Nos ne loqui quidem.
how do i think in one	Puto quomodo in unum
He knew just how lucky he was.	Sciebat modo quam felix esset.
I was ready for it	Paratus essem eam
So it is.	Ita est.
and thus it has.	et sic habet.
Or not really.	Vel non vere.
Nothing has been done.	Nihil factum est.
Do the job that you want.	Facit officium quod vis.
I want you to have this	Volo te habere hoc
I don't talk much.	Non multum loqui.
I'm not doing anything so	Non aliquid facere me ita
But neither.	Sed nec.
Please do it.	Placet id faciam.
To be honest than none.	Ut sit amet quam nulla.
I just want for tonight	Ego iustus volo pro hac nocte
But only to be able to know that it was not enough.	Sed modo scire se posse non erat satis.
it will be certain for me.	certum mihi erit.
have not been	Non fuisse
I don't need to talk much.	Non multum debeo loqui.
I wanted to say yes.	Etiam dicere volui.
Not much to say	Non multa dicere
But neither before nor before.	Sed nec ante ante.
I know what this means	Scio quid hoc modo
But he knew for sure that it was nothing else.	Sed sciebat certe nihil aliud esse.
That will be good.	Quod bonum erit.
I am doing something.	Aliquid a me facio.
It does not please.	Non placet.
A man can do nothing for himself.	Aliquis ne sibi quidem quicquam potest.
But all this to me.	Sed hoc mihi omnia.
You can do this in	Potes hoc in.
Now that is.	Nunc ut est.
I don't know exactly how this work is.	Nescio quomodo hoc opus sit, prorsus.
Something to do.	Aliquid facere.
In not the time itself.	In non tempus ipsum.
Not good, she thought.	Non bona, putavit.
Never, never wanted that car	Numquam, numquam volui ut currus
Tell her what happened.	Dic ei quod factum est.
I don't know what's here	Nescio quid hic
It was too good to go.	Erat etiam bonum ut.
Yes, yes, yes and no.	Ita est, est sic et non est non.
I'll never do it.	Numquam id faciam.
He had never been there.	Nunquam ibi fuit.
I do as a person says	Facio sicut homo dicit
I'm going to get there soon.	Eo mox illuc.
I don't need anymore.	Non opus est amplius.
You can go there	Potes ire illuc
I just don't want to.	Non modo vis.
Men you know.	Homines scis.
exactly what would be done	Prorsus quid faciendum esset
He knows me.	Scit me.
Not just to sit.	Non solum ut sit.
So do you.	Sic te facere.
I could work with him	Cum eo potui opus
I saw him at school each morning	Vidi illum ad scholam se mane
He can't go.	Ire non potest.
I can't say she really likes you	Non possum dicere quae vere vult te
But some more than that.	Sed aliquam quam.
but I know a lot	Scio tamen multum
I thought about hug with you	Cogitavi de amet tecum
But that's from you.	Sed id ex te.
I knew he wasn't	Sciebam se non esse
I'll tell you yet	Dicam tamen
I already have it together	Ego iam illud simul
We cannot do this.	Hoc facere non possumus.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
I need to accept that	Mihi opus est accipere quod
Essentially enough.	Per se satis.
I can't do anything with it	Non possum facere nihil cum eo
He was not certain.	Non erat certum.
no one knew where he was now.	nemo scivit ubi nunc esset.
I wanted to know more about him	Scire volui de eius
I think we're here to see it this way.	Puto nos hoc modo hic videre.
I wanted to be like him	Volui esse sicut eum
Really sorry.	Vere paenitet.
They are not .	Non sunt .
It seemed a little, so little to wish.	Parum videbatur, tam parum velle.
It's still you.	Est adhuc te.
I need to get away from him	Mihi opus est ut ab eo
Now you can't see me.	Nunc me videre non potes.
I wanted to do it myself.	ipse facere volui.
He had to go home.	Ire domum habuit.
I am not good.	non sum bonus.
But it was not that.	Sed non erat id.
That is how we are.	Id est, quomodo nos.
I want to know, but not only	Scire volo, sed non modo
I hope you can hear me	Spero te potest audire me
I can see you, you know	Videre possum te, tu scis
I'm not fine.	Non sum bene.
You still need this.	Adhuc opus hoc.
all at once.	Omnes simul.
We don't need this.	Hic nobis non opus est.
To be honest.	Ut sit amet.
We know.	Nos scire.
I think you'd like to understand	Puto quod velis intelligere
The Office.	Officium.
I don't want to know anyone	Non vis scire quis
All days are bad.	Omnes dies mali sunt.
But not from which.	Sed non quam ex.
This week is more.	Hac septimana, plus est.
How well you have done	Ut bene omnia fecisti
You need to know this already.	Hoc iam debes scire.
He is not himself.	Ipse nec ipse.
I'm glad to see it now.	Gaudeo quod nunc video.
It is his job to do.	Officium suum est hoc facere.
Not this.	Non hoc.
I didn't think you were that either	Non putabam te esse quod vel
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
for no one knew how to come to him.	Nemo enim sciebat venire ad eum.
Don't even know his name	Ne nomen quidem eius novi
In us too.	In nobis quoque.
And rightly indeed.	Et recte quidem.
I have everything.	omnia habeo.
It can be better.	Potest melius.
There is no evil in him.	Non est malum in se.
I can't do this often	Saepe hoc facere non possum
You're not using this	Non te per hoc
I don't want to think of what	Non vis cogitare quae per
He knew everything here and now, here and now.	Omnia sciebat hic et nunc hic et nunc.
Both are necessary.	Utrumque opus est.
I can't say that now	Non possum dicere quod nunc
A dog can only be a dog	Canis non potest esse nisi canem
I need her.	Mihi opus est eius.
Nothing more for her.	Nihil amplius ad eam.
There was someone to know what he wanted.	Quid vellet, erat aliquis scire.
Which of course is good.	Quod quidem bonum.
I want to do everything	Volo facere omnia
He thought he was saying something, but he did not know what.	Putabat se aliquid dicere, sed quid nesciebat.
It is now.	Nunc est.
I feel very sorry for this	Valde hoc factum sentio
I don't need to get in.	Non opus est ut in.
I like to be with you all	Ego autem ut cum omnia
I could not speak	Non potui loqui
He wants to see me.	Me videre vult.
We have been told about everything, but tonight	Dictum est nobis de omnibus, sed hac nocte
It can be fixed.	Certum esse potest.
I hope to come and see you again	Spero te venire et me iterum videre
I will do it	Ego facturus est
I can't quite get there just yet	Non possum satis illuc modo adhuc
But there is no such thing as yourself.	Ut sed nulla ipsum.
Now it wasn't like it is.	Nunc non erat ut est.
I think he is for me	Puto se esse ad me
I wish indeed.	Utinam quidem.
I don't know where he is	Nescio ubi ille
I could see nothing.	Nihil videre potui.
I'm not good to you	Non sum bonum tibi
I can also	Possum etiam
I don't mean in this way.	Non hoc modo vult.
I don't know if you know this.	Nescio si hoc scis.
I haven't seen one before	Non vidi unum ante
And no time before.	Et tempus non ante.
Maybe it wasn't him.	Aliquam non ipsum erat.
She thought he probably meant to be kind.	Putavit probabiliter intellexit eum genus esse.
I think I want to see that	Puto me velle videre quod
That's not right.	Quod non recte.
sorry for being like that before	Paenitet me esse ut ex eo ante
It could even be somebody.	Posset esse vel quis.
Perhaps his father could.	Pater eius fortasse potuit.
But it was not so.	Sed non erat sic.
After that time is enough.	Post id tempus satis est.
But not this year.	Sed non hoc anno.
I can do it for you	Non possum facere vobis
I knew all that I wanted to say	Sciebam omnia quae mihi dicere volui
That would not be good.	Quod non esset bonum.
Something's wrong almost certainly, but help comes.	Aliquid mali fere certe, sed auxilium venit.
At the same time.	Per idem tempus.
I know how much she loves you	Scio quantum te amat
It is certain.	Certum eft.
I didn't think it was fun either	Non putavi amet vel
You won't get anything done	Et non erit tibi aliquid factum
He didn't even question it.	Ne id quidem fecit quaestionem.
It wasn't just from him.	A se tantum non fuit.
The father is there too.	Pater ibi etiam.
I want it so badly	Volo eam tam male
Maybe you can do it.	Forsitan id facere potes.
I just didn't get to it.	Modo non ad illud.
There is no one to find out.	Nulla quis ex ut.
I need it better than	Mihi opus est melius quam
You know enough, too.	Satis scis, nimium.
I don't know what to do.	quid id facerem nescio.
Nothing I know really.	Nihil novi vere.
I was never told what to do	Ego numquam indicavit quid esset?
I could not tell her that	Non potui dicere ei quod
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
I knew you were that	Sciebam te esse quod
It was not enough.	Non satis fuit.
I hope you have something good for me	Spero te habere aliquid bonum mihi
I had as much difficulty	Facile habui quantum
I know how to say to yourself	Scio modo te ipsum dicere
It was for us.	Pro nobis erat.
I know this to be entirely true	Scio hoc esse omnino verum
never do.	numquam facere.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil cum in.
I know you don't understand him	Scio te non intelligere eum
But I don't always like it.	Non semper placet, sed.
in the morning i	mane ego.
Someone must have.	Habere aliquem debet.
I told him the truth	Verum dixi ei
where it is not seen.	ubi non videtur.
I needed to do it.	Mihi opus erat facere.
It was not much, but it was his.	Non multum erat, sed eius erat.
sorry for what is gone	Paenitet me quod abiit
I need this help	Hoc opus auxilium
This was better.	Melius hoc erat.
At length I did it.	Tandem id feci.
It is probable.	Probabile est.
I don't believe this to be	Ego non credo hoc fieri
I could not be more evil.	non potui plus esse mali.
I have to accept that	Habeo accipere quod
I ain't got to play with you	Ego non obtinuit ut te ludere
The same thing with me.	Idem mecum.
I never said anything about it	Numquam dixit aliquid de illo
I didn't know if it was	Ego nesciebam si esset
Which he did not.	Quod non fecit.
None but none for.	Nulla sed nulla enim.
I can't believe that	Non possum credere me quod
Not as much as you think.	Non quantum putas.
I didn't know what to do for him.	Ego nesciebam quid pro eo facerem.
I could not say for sure	Non potui dicere pro certo
I think they are more than we are friends	Puto se plus quam amicos nos esse
I know you won't be again	Scio te non esse iterum
Nor can it be any more like it.	Nec potest amplius esse simile.
Everyone was there.	Omnibus erat.
He really looks like mine.	Ille vere spectat sicut meus.
I thought you'd gone	Cogitavi velis abiit
I didn't know what it was about	Ego nesciebam quid esset de
I didn't know how to stop it	Ego nesciebam quam prohibere eam
No one ever wanted to be here.	Nemo umquam hic esse voluit.
I don't let anyone do anything	Ne quis ego te facere quicquam
i would never go.	nunquam ire volo.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
he wished to remain.	manere voluit.
I haven't seen you in a long time	Non vidi te diu
I do.	Facio.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
I need to know	Scire debeo
I really appreciate this	Ego vere bene hoc
It was one morning.	Mane unum fuit.
I think we're finally friends	Puto nos tandem amicos
as i see you.	sicut ego te.
I didn't want to believe that	Nolui credere quod
That has nothing to do with me.	Id nihil ad me.
I can't come today.	Hodie venire non possum.
I can give it to you.	tibi dare possum.
i am just thinking about that	Ego iustus cogitas quod
Tell me.	Dic mihi.
But there is more.	Sed plus est.
I could not understand you	Non potui intelligere te
I need money to get through	Mihi opus est pecuniam accipere per
I didn't know you could do this	Nesciebam te hoc facere
I only do this at the moment	Tantum ego hoc tempore
There was nothing she could do.	Nihil erat quod facere posset.
I want to talk to you about it.	de illo tecum loqui volo.
We still have a job to do.	Adhuc habemus officium facere.
I don't like seeing him like this	Et non sicut cum eo sic
There is no need.	Nihil opus est.
We're doing this now.	Facere nos hoc modo.
We can't help you.	Te adiuvare non possumus.
It is impossible for man.	Homo fieri non potest.
it is now.	nunc est.
But not.	Sed non.
I see you with me	Ego te mecum
No one knew that he was here.	Nemo scivit hic esse.
I can never leave him alone.	Eum solum relinquere numquam possum.
You need to think about this.	De hoc debes cogitare.
I said the same	Dixi idem
I haven't seen him	Non vidi eum
But we cannot.	Sed non possumus.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
As I already have in mine	Ut iam in mea habeo
I could not speak.	Non potui dicere.
You owe her.	Tu eam debes.
I've seen him here.	Ego illum huc vidi.
This time has come.	Hoc ad tempus venit.
Plus, not yourself.	Plus, non ipsum.
not always happy	Non semper est felix
But probably nothing was.	Sed verisimiliter nihil fuit.
I believe you.	Tibi credo.
We are His people.	Eius nobis qui eum.
I need to do it.	Mihi opus est facere.
I don't know why or when.	Nescio quare, vel quando.
Now this.	Hic nunc.
I think that's so important	Puto quod ita sit amet
I'm all for you	Ego tibi omnia
I couldn't see well enough	Non potui videre bene satis
i think it is bad	Puto esse malum
I saw him	Vidi eum
I know his name, but nothing more.	Nomen eius novi, sed nihil amplius.
On this night.	Hac nocte.
This also seems to be the case.	Ita etiam hic esse videtur.
I can't live with him	Non possum vivere cum illo
It is still that way.	Adhuc illuc.
I'm very sorry for my lunch	Paenitet me valde prandium meum
I thought, you know.	Cogitavi, scis.
Want to see my work.	Vis videre opus meum.
I don't know what this is all about	Nescio quid hoc de omnibus
Certainly not about you.	Certe non de te.
I would like to hear.	Audire vellem.
It's up to us.	Est ad nobis.
i am not doing it	Ego non facere illud
I can't live this anymore	Hoc iam non possum vivere
I couldn't do anything	Non potui facere quicquam
I can't do anything	Non possum facere quicquam
You just do it now.	Tu modo id nunc facias.
I don't like you dog.	Non amo te, canis.
If you want to stay there more, you can.	Si plus ibi manere vis, potes.
This does not do us any good.	Quod nobis hic non facit bonum.
It's very bad.	Malum est multum.
That was by the way.	Ut a erat erat.
I never want to be with you	Numquam vis esse apud te
I even have a job.	Ego quidem officium habeo.
It's getting to the point that I'm speaking right.	Is de die questus est quod me recte loqui.
I don't like this room.	Hoc cubiculum non placet.
Just say it.	Modo id dic.
That's you too.	Id tu quoque.
I could not go	Non potui ire
I doubt if there will be any	Dubito si quid erit
You are not the same.	Non es tu ipse.
I never even know his name	Numquam etiam nomen eius novi
I couldn't think of anything to say	Non potui cogitare aliquid dicere
But not from.	Sed non ex.

I am not very happy with you.	Non sit amet ipsum tecum.

But he was able to do so.	Sed hoc facere potuit.
I like the way you think	Ego amo Sic cogitas

It's always great.	Semper magna est.
And it's going to be hard.	Et difficile futurum est.
Now you're ready for me.	Nunc paratus es ad mea.
I don't know when and how	Nescio quando et quomodo

I have more than one name	Habeo plus quam unum nomen

If that's who they are.	Id si qui sunt.
He says great things.	Dicit magna.
This never occurred	Hoc numquam occurrit
I knew how I saw	Scivi quomodo vidi
I don't know you either	Non novi te vel
I could go over there	Non potui ire in ibi
I tried hard to think about it	Conatus sum difficile cogitare de eo
This is exactly the same.	Hoc prorsus idem est.
I think you're home now	Puto te domum, nunc
not always here	Non semper hic
He could not come to me.	Ad me venire non potuit.
I've never heard a name	Ego numquam audivi nomen

But that was done.	Sed id factum est.
I want nothing.	Nihil volo.
I can't see how bad it can be	Non possum videre quomodo tibi malum esse possit
What was truly said.	Quod vere dictum est.
That day was happy.	Felix ille dies fuit.
I believe you know what's happened	Scis, credo, quid acciderit
i want to do this.	hoc facere volo.
I could only speak for myself.	Tantum loqui potui pro me.
This is not necessary, however.	Hoc non opus est, sed.
I hope you have some time	Spero te habere aliquo tempore
It's time and great.	Aliquam et magna.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
You are lucky.	Felix es.
I could not see him, but he was there	Eum videre non potui, sed ibi erat
I believe that	Ego credo quod
I don't care, that's for sure	Nolo, id est certe
perhaps we are.	fortasse sumus.
I just want to buy.	Modo ut emere velis.
But he was like him.	Sed erat ut ipsum.
I could not find one	Non potui invenire unum

I feel for him.	pro eo sentio.
I can't live without you	Non possum sine te

I am really out of it	Ego vere ex eo
I could only speak to him	Non potui tantum dicere ei
If anything is good.	Si quid est bonum.
We need your help	Non opus est tibi auxilio
I don't want to talk anymore	Non vis loqui amplius
But at the same time it is not.	Sed simul non est.
I wanted to talk to someone	Volui loqui ad aliquem
I don't know who he is	Nescio quis est
I just want to get home to it	Ego iustus volo domum ad eam

How not to use humans.	Ut non quam homines.
This time it was not.	Hoc nunc non erat.
I have done a lot of things.	Multum feci.
I hope one day to you	Spero autem die ad vos
Today is a similar question.	Hodie similis quaestio est.
What he wanted.	Quod voluit.
He cannot speak.	Loqui non potest.
You stay.	Tu mane.
He would not listen.	Noluit audire.
To anyone except that.	Ut quis nisi quam.
I certainly won't say it.	Ego certe non dicam.
He wanted me to be here.	Hic me voluit.
I don't really like him	Non vere similis ei
Do as I told you.	Fac ut tibi dixi.
I don't want to know this.	Nolo hoc scire.
This was easy enough.	Hoc satis facile fuit.
I told my mom that she would like to come along to me	Me meum, quod non indicavit mihi per vellem venire
You can't see me.	Me videre non potes.
I like to be a guy.	Mihi placet esse guy.
I know who you are now	Scio qui nunc es
This is everything.	Hoc est omnibus.
I think you are right too.	Puto te quoque recte.
I still have it.	Adhuc habeo eam.
I don't know how this work is.	Nescio quomodo hoc opus sit.
You believe in.	Tu in.
I knew he would understand	Sciebam se intelligere
He was so sure about him.	Tam certus erat de se.
I'm not at all	Ut omnino non sum
I am still sure which one is	Certus adhuc essem quod unum sit
You don't want to see evil	Non vis videre malum
they are still there.	adhuc ibi sunt.
To be honest there is none.	Ut sit amet nulla est.
Haven't had any time	Non habuit in aliquo tempore
I didn't think.	Non putavi.
I could not leave you.	Te relinquere non potui.
I don't want to think about something	Non vis cogitare de aliquid
I couldn't understand anything to say	Non potui intelligere aliquid dicere

But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
It will never happen today	Numquam hodie futurum
I want the same thing.	volo, Idem.
It is like here and here.	Hic et hic similis est.
I don't have to say anything	Non habeo dicere aliquid
i knew it would be	Scivi sic fore
I just can't do it	Ego iustus non faciam ei
I wanted to know why this was done	Scire volui quare hoc factum est
Maybe not.	Aliquam non.
Very kind.	Ipsum genus.
I will tell you.	Dicam tibi.
Yes or it was that.	Etiam vel erat quam.
I saw him in his room	Vidi eum in cubiculum suum
But tonight he was not sure.	Sed hac nocte non erat certus.
That's what we are.	Id sumus.
Never more than now	Numquam plus quam nunc
It's almost time.	Ipsum fere tempus.
A little something long after	A paulo post diu aliquid
We cannot see.	Videre non possumus.
That's something.	Quod est aliquid.
It does not please.	Non placet.
I have too much to do	Habeo nimium facere
It has been so long.	Tam diu fuit.
You do not do this.	Hoc non facis.
But that which is, is said to be important.	Sed id quam est, sit amet dictum est.
But I don't get any of it.	Sed nec aliquam ex.
I know you do.	Scio te facere.
I can't believe you never told him	Non possum credere te non indicavit ei
From there	Ex ibi.
That which was not done.	Quod factum non est.
I think you are going	Puto te ire
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Nescio quid mali me.
I told him you were sick	Male dixi ei es
I tried to get away from it	Conatus sum ut ab eius
A very good question indeed	A valde bona quaestio quidem
I didn't know what else to say.	Quid aliud dicere nesciebam.
I guess he said the truth	Suspicor quod verum dixit
I see them all.	Omnes video.
This was and was not.	Hic erat, et non erat.
I will do it myself	Faciam ipse
But it is not so.	Sed non ita est.
I told him not about anyone but about me	dixi ei non de aliquo sed de me
I would be interested to think about it	Ut sit amet cogitare de illo
But he must act quickly.	Sed cito agere debet.
I need to see it	Mihi opus est ad eam
I don't know much.	Nescio multum.
No one knew for sure.	Nemo certe scivit.
I still don't believe	Ego tamen non credo
I am nothing else.	Ego nihil aliud sum.
This year.	Hoc anno.
I feel that it has something to do with me	Sentio quod habet aliquid esse cum mea
yes there was some	Etiam non aliquam erat
I am ready when my time comes	Ego paratus sum, cum tempus meum venit
Not very good work.	Non ipsum bonum opus.
He could not do the thing.	Rem facere non potuit.
Now that's hard.	Nunc id difficile est.
I hope to see you tonight	Spero videre me hac nocte
But they're not.	Sed nimium non sunt.
All so well.	Omnes ita bene.
I probably would too	Ego probabiliter esset, etiam
I never understood	Numquam intellexit
We can go home now.	Nunc domum ire possumus.
One thing does enough.	Unum satis facit.
I just wanted to give you something to think about.	Modo volui dare tibi aliquid cogitare de.
This will be difficult.	Hoc difficile erit.
I couldn't believe it	Non potui credere eam
I know how hard it can be	Scio quam difficile esse possit
And got better.	Melius quoque obtinuit.
But I will say this.	Sed hoc dicam.
Don't even give me a name	Mihi ne nomen quidem ei dare
I didn't know this bad	Nesciebam hoc malum
I don't want him there.	Ibi illum nolo.
I wish you were here	Utinam hic
We can't do anything.	Non possumus facere aliquid.
I don't know everything.	Nescio omnia.
I wanted you to know this.	Hoc te scire volui.
He wanted to understand this.	Hoc intelligere voluit.
I forgot the plan	Oblitus sum quod consilium
He just wants to be away from everyone	Ille iustus vult ut ab omnibus
I could not tell anyone about this	Non potui dicere quis de hoc
This was work.	Hoc erat opus.
I didn't know anything about it	Et ego nesciebam quod de eius
And for that, you have to keep him.	Et pro id, habes ut illum.
I didn't want to be at home	Nolui esse domi
yes I think this is how it is	Etiam hoc puto quomodo sit
But it was now.	Sed erat nunc.
Maybe it won't be too bad.	Fortasse non erit nimium malum.
Nothing good enough about him	Nihil satis de illo
I'm afraid of all that was	Vereor omnia quae fuit
It should be done.	Fieri debet.
I thought he was sick	Putavi se male
I just couldn't find him.	Modo eum invenire non potui.
That has not been done.	Quod non factum est.
I have a book about it too.	Librum de illo quoque habeo.
I know what is true	Scio quod verum est
Well, it's not true.	Bene, non verum est.
I was always there for him	Ibi semper essem pro eo
I believe this is true	Credo hoc verum est
He did well there.	Bene ibi fecit.
I've already tried everything	Iam conatus sum omnia
You'll never want to come between you and your job	Numquam vis venire inter te et officium tuum
They are always together.	Semper simul sunt.
There is no way to do this.	Non est hoc iter faciendum.
I don't want his money	Nolo pecuniam suam
But who said nothing.	Sed quis dictum nisi.
I will tell him everything.	Dicam ei omnia.
Great save on time, but not very happy.	Magna nisi in tempore, sed parum felix.
The father did it.	Pater^ fecit.
No one never owes me	Numquam me debere nemo
I told you everything was okay	Dixi vobis omnia esse bene
It was one thing and another.	Aliud aliud fuit.
He knows what's going on for me.	Scit quid mihi eat.
But this is still nothing.	Sed hoc adhuc nihil est.
I didn't know where.	Ego nesciebam ubi.
I would like to know.	Scire vellem.
But that is not true.	Sed id non est verum.
Yes I do.	Etiam facio.
Which indeed has been done.	Quod quidem factum est.
If this is possible.	Si id fieri potest.
I know your nationality.	Novi genus tuum.
Not that it was.	Non quod fuit.
He didn't want to do that.	Noluit facere.
But neither was he.	Sed nec erat.
There is probably nothing else to do.	Probabile non est aliud facere.
and he ought to do so.	et sic facere debet.
I hope you come to my office	Spero te venire ad officium meum
But see this.	Sed hoc vide.
I'm going to work on it	Ego ad opus eius
I'm almost there.	Fere ibi sum.
That night I needed to get there.	Illa nocte opus esset ut illuc.
I did not know this.	Ego hoc nesciebam.
It is not to say.	Dicere non est.
Get or choose from.	Ut vel velit ex.
I was there with more	Ibi eram cum plus
This work has.	Hoc opus habet.
They are bad people.	Mali homines sunt.
This is not the same.	Hoc non est simile.
I could not have said better.	Non potui melius me dixisse.
I don't really want it here	Non vere volo eam hic
She could say yes.	Posset etiam dicere.
I want you to be able to believe me	Volo te posse credere me
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
I couldn't deal with this guy	Hoc guy non potui agere
I don't want to live anymore	Non vis vivere amplius
Thus it is not possible.	Sic fieri non potest.
He has one.	Habet unum.
I know that I am	Scio me esse
Who knows what will happen next year.	Quis scit quid futurum sit anno proximo.
It was not for you.	Non erat tibi.
I said yesterday	Dixi heri
You'll never be like him	Numquam erit similis ei
But that's how.	Sed id quam quam.
If it seems to you, that's the very reason why you want to see me.	Si tibi videtur, id ipsum cur me vis videre.
It would seem that he himself.	Videtur quod ipse.
This is what it is.	Hoc quid sit.
But there is more.	Sed plus est.
I am satisfied with this one	Mihi satis hoc unum
You just said it.	Tu modo dixisti.
I could only think about it	Tantum cogitare potui de eo
I never even understood	Numquam etiam intellexit
But he did not come home that night.	Sed non illa nocte domum venit.
It seemed not even to do it.	Videbatur ne id quidem facere.
Now, yes.	Nunc, etiam.
And do this again.	Et hoc fac iterum.
Without this there is nothing.	Sine hoc nihil est.
And no one saw.	Et nemo vidit.
He was kind.	Erat genus.
A little too soon	Paulo nimium cito
But now there was none.	Nunc sed nulla erat.
I knew this is not true	Hoc non est verum scivi
I don't know how it could be done	Nescio quomodo fieri potuit
We have something for everyone!	Aliquid habemus pro omnibus!.
I hope it is well with you.	Spero autem ut bene sit tibi.
It's better to go to me	Melius est ut ad me
To this.	Ad hoc.
I made him leave the house	Ego feci eum relinquere domum
I won't even know what to say.	Nolo etiam quid dicam.
I don't even know what it is.	Nescio quidem quid sit.
And now you are here.	Et nunc hic es.
I know what's better than what we have now	Scio quid melius quam id quod nunc habemus
Now you can't.	Iam non potes.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
I'm glad this is happening.	hoc fieri gaudeo.
Which indeed was not.	Quod quidem non erat.
But it is only.	Sed non nisi est.
in who's who's on.	In quis ex quis est.
If it pleases you, please.	Si placet, placet.
He said with certainty.	Certo dixit.
Well again.	Iterum bene.
I will tell you this.	Dicam tibi hoc.
I didn't know what it was	Ego nesciebam quid esset
So was the father.	Ita pater fuit.
He has nothing.	Nihil habet.
I can't believe how far we've come here	Non possum credere quam nos huc usque
I know what you are saying	Scio te ipsum dicere
he saw them coming.	vidit venire.
I feel very happy now	Sentio valde felix nunc
I think it's not a matter.	Puto non esse rem.
I think we could do much better.	Puto nos multo melius facere posse.
For not me.	Non enim me.
Now you want again.	Nunc iterum vis.
I thought as hard as I could get	Cogitavi tam difficile quam posset accipere
I never really wanted	Numquam vere voluit
For he does not have the truth.	Verum enim non habet.
I know.	Ego scio.
I need to get out now	Mihi opus est ut ex nunc
What he had not.	Quod non habuit.
Look at what's happened.	Vide quid acciderit.
But it is so.	Sed sic est.
There is nothing to give	Non est dare aliquid
I don't like it at all	Non placet omnino
This does not surprise me.	Hoc non miror.
I could not live like this	Non potui sic vivere
I want to get through my love	Per volo ut mea
But there was a lot out there.	Sed sit amet ex erat.
it was necessary, he thought.	opus esse, putavit.
Now he was here.	Nunc hic erat.
I thought it was just done.	Putavi modo factum esse.
That was done before.	Quod ante factum est.
It was too late.	Sero erat.
Maybe or some great things.	Aliquam vel aliquam magna.
I love him but I can't live	Eum amo, sed non possum vivere
Which is the first.	Quod primum est.
You can see there.	Ibi videre potes.
I completely forgot	Omnino oblitus sum
To this end	Quod ad hoc.
I haven't ever had something like this	Ego non semper habuit aliquid simile hoc
I don't know why not	Nescio cur non
My father gave me enough.	Pater mihi satis dedit.
I told him the truth and only the truth	Dixi ei verum et solum verum
I want to stay out of this	Volo manere ex hoc
He did the same thing even last year.	Idem fecit etiam proximo anno.
he had only one	unum tantum habuit.
I could buy this.	Hoc emere potui.
There is no such thing as yourself.	Nulla id quam ipsum.
we are still alive.	adhuc sumus.
But this is true.	Sed hoc verum est.
We probably are.	Verisimiliter sumus.
I thought you didn't live	Cogitavi non vivere
This may be so for you.	Hoc tibi ita sit.
I just want you not	EGO iustus volo tibi non
I had to buy some time	Habui emere aliquo tempore
I could not speak, refused to speak	Non potui loqui, noluit loqui
I thought I would be here already	Iam hic putavi fore
No one wanted it.	Nemo eam voluit.
I don't know what happened	nescio quid factum est
But this was not.	Sed hoc non fuit.
Not exactly.	Non prorsus.
To be very happy.	Ut sit amet ipsum ipsum.
I want to be there	Volo enim ibi esse
Nothing has been done yet.	Nihil tamen factum est.
I have a room now	Ego habeo cubiculum nunc
Well you know I don't want him anymore.	Bene scis te non amplius eum velle.
I've always tried to do my best	Ego semper conatus ad facere meum
All I can see is him	Omnia possum videre eum
I can't, I can't.	Non possum, non possum.
I'm not sure someone really knows.	Non sum certus aliquis vere scit.
I just want more from him	Ego iustus volo plus ab eo
Not really.	Non vere.
I don't know you.	Non te novi.
not his father.	Non pater eius.
And always do well	Et semper bene facit
He came there again.	Ibi iterum venit.
I can't even say for sure where there is a problem	Non possum etiam dicere pro certo ubi sit quaestio
Yes and it was said out loud.	Etiam et dictum magna.
I could post me	Non potui post me
But he did not say.	Sed non dixit.
I was always absolutely sure it would happen.	Certus eram semper omnino fore.
I certainly want it.	Ego certe volo.
I was really shocked yesterday and this morning	Ego vere valde heri et hoc mane
No one can know.	Nemo potest scire.
No one wants it.	Nulla id enim velit.
I didn't know what would have happened to you	Ego nesciebam quid de te factum esset
This is possible.	Hoc fieri potest.
I want it I love me	Volo eam amo me
I wanted to be like my dad	Volui esse sicut pater meus
I just never went home.	Ego iustus numquam abiit in domum suam.
never do.	numquam facere.
I go all out	Ire mihi omnia
But this is not possible.	Sed hoc fieri non potest.
But that's only the same thing.	Sed id ipsum nisi.
This is not right now.	Hoc nunc non est.
There is no giving.	Non est dare.
I heard her say my name	Audivi eam dicere nomen meum
Yes, it was a lot of time, but it was said.	Etiam tempus sit amet erat sed dictum.
I scarcely heard.	Vix audivi.
I always had something to say to him	Semper habuit aliquid dicere ei
He said to live well.	Dixit bene vivere.
I will never talk to her again	Ego numquam loqui ad eam iterum
For I was not there	Non enim eram ibi
If you don't want to go on too long.	Non si diutius ire vis.
That will be there for a long time.	Quod diu ibi erit.
I can't say anything else	Non possum dicere aliquid aliud
You can never be more than you already are.	Numquam plus esse potes quam iam es.
I am all who you are	Ego sum omnes qui es
I think you need to find someone	Puto aliquem invenire debes
That's what I need here.	Id quod hic opus est.
What better?!	Quid melius?!.
Now is the time for him.	Nunc tempus ipsum.
You can't stop, you can't even think.	Non potes prohibere, ne cogitare quidem potes.
I just don't know so much.	Modo non tam.
This can only be good	Hoc non potest esse nisi bonum
Never give anyone a name	Numquam quis nomen
I can't come with you.	Non possum venire tecum.
This is where it should be done quickly.	Hic ubi cito debet fieri.
I thought you would be me	Putavi fore me
but these things.	sed haec.
i knew class well	Scivi genus bene
I never heard you speak to me	Numquam audivi te mihi loqui
I don't do anything at all	Ego omnino non aliquid
Someone must be at home.	Aliquis domi esse debet.
never see each other again	Numquam se iterum
I thought it would work	Cogitavi ut opus esset
There was no question whether it could be done or not.	Nulla quaestio erat, annon fieri posset necne.
I think that's exactly what I meant	Puto quod prorsus quid esset
That or none at all.	Id vel nulla.
I really am someone	Ego vere sum aliquis
It's going to happen now.	Futurum est nunc.
It was better, better than that.	Melius erat, melius quam.
He does not say.	Non dicit.
I will tell him to be mine	Dicam eum meum esse
It was scarcely possible.	Vix erat.
Or perhaps not.	Vel fortasse non.
I think this one could be.	Hoc unum puto posse.
She told me not.	Non indicavit mihi.
I need a new one	Ego novi unum opus
May I have and do	Utinam habere me et facere
I believe too about me	Credo etiam de me
Today is hard for me.	Hodie mihi difficile est.
I would not know.	scire nolui.
There was a lot to talk about here.	Hic multum loqui de illa fuit.
He knows what it is.	Ipse quid sit nescit.
It's not the same.	Etiam non ipsum est.
I'd like to see that.	Libet videre quod.
This is how he did it.	Hoc quomodo fecerit.
Now	Nunc.
That was going to happen.	Quod futurum erat.
Can this be done?	Hoc fieri potest?.
We'll be here in the afternoon	Non erit hic post meridiem
He was with us.	Erat nobiscum.
I had to use it	Ego quoque ad illud
I will tell you.	Ego dicam tibi.
You've just gone.	Te solum abiit.
This was not good.	Hoc non erat bonum.
I don't really know him	Non vere scio eum
That's his thing.	Id eius rem.
I want people to know.	Volo homines scire.
I probably won't do anything else	Ego verisimile non est aliquid aliud
Nothing else could have been done.	Nihil aliud fieri potuit.
He was soon home	Et primum erat in domum suam
It will not be difficult.	Non sit difficile.
I hope one day	Spero autem die
Haven't gone home yet	Non tamen abiit in domum suam
I don't quite know what to do.	Non satis scio quid faciam.
But I can't help you	Ego autem non possum te
Which indeed has not been rightly said.	Quod quidem non recte dictum est.
I was in him.	in eo fui.
I want to see him	Volo videre eum
let him go, let him go.	Eat eat.
He thought he would never see again.	Putabat se numquam iterum videre.
I wonder if you can say the same	Miror si potes dicere idem
I'm gonna be out now	Ego nunc sit amet
therefore he was also here.	quare etiam hic fuit.
I can completely understand this	Hoc possum omnino intelligere
Which he says all about him.	Quod dicit omnia de eo.
I'm afraid	Vereor ne
Take some time before.	Aliquam tempus aliquam ante.
But I can't believe	Ego autem non possum credere
See what he did this year.	Vide quid hoc anno fecerit.
I told him that no one would say	Ei dixi ne quis dicere
But I still don't know why.	Sed tamen non cur.
He thought the same thing.	Idem putabat.
I don't want to leave her	Non vis relinquere eius
I hardly know him, if at all	vix eum novi, si quicquam
We can not.	Non possumus.
It was already enough.	Jam satis erat.
I know all that you've done	Scio omnia quae fecisti
I haven't heard him coming in	Ego non audivi eum venire in
But from none other than that.	Sed a nulla quam.
I was with him	Essem cum eo
But not from him.	Sed non ex ipsum.
How great is it.	Magna est quam.
I hope you don't.	Spero te non.
He had not.	Non habuit.
I am very sad about this	De hoc ego sum nimis
I just want to know who you are	Ego iustus volo scire quis es
He could not speak.	Non potuit dicere.
But it is not always.	Sed non semper est.
I know the future	Scio futurum
I believe it to be true	Credo verum esse
Which was better.	Quod melius erat.
But he could not do it.	Sed facere potuit.
It was said out loud.	Dictum magna.
He is a good boy.	Bonus puer est.
This is nothing.	Hoc nihil.
I can't believe how easy it is	Non possum credere quam facile est
he did not know what more he could do.	quid plus posset nesciebat.
I want to help her.	Volo eam adiuvare.
I don't know whether he likes it.	Nescio an velit.
He said the truth.	Ille verum dixit.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
You don't want to see this again	Hoc iterum te videre non vis
It is now or always.	Nunc vel semper est.
I doubt it will ever be the same	Dubito semper idem erit
That's probably what's wrong with me.	Id est probabiliter quid mali me.
We can't see him.	Non possumus videre eum.
I thought it was very good	Putavi ipsum bonum
Certainly he will, but certainly.	Certe vult, sed certe.
The whole plan is there.	Totum consilium ibi est.
I love you now and always	Te amo nunc et semper
This time is not easy.	Hoc tempus non est facile.
I never wanted to see that man again	Numquam volui videre quod homo iterum
And he wanted her to be.	Et ipse voluit eam esse.
to do, to do, to do.	Facere, facere, facere, facere.
I know you probably have what you need to do	Scio te probabiliter habere quod debes facere
I just said it could be	Ego iustus dixit posse
I want to see her again	Volo videre eam iterum
He was not.	Non erat.
I feel something coming.	Sentio aliquid venire.
He could not hear correctly.	Recte audire non potuit.
It is not the same.	Non idem.
Yes school week was good.	Etiam schola septimana bene erat.
They are enough.	Satis sunt.
He had a house.	Habuit domum.
I don't quite know what to say.	Non satis scio quid dicam.
I won't do that	Ego non faciam illud
I could not do it	Non potui facere
She's got an easy time.	Facile tempus in illa obtinuit.
It was already enough.	Iam satis erat.
I don't see her do it	Non videre eam facere
There was no time.	Nulla tempus erat.
Yes that's only out.	Etiam id nisi ex.
If she could find it.	Si posset eam invenire.
But it is not for me to understand.	Sed intelligere non est mihi.
It was still a little later	Paulo post fuit adhuc
Everything is so important.	Omnia tam magna.
I know what's coming to you	Scio quid ad te venire
The man is still not speaking.	Vir adhuc non loquitur.
I met someone there I looked like him	Occurrit aliquis ibi vidi sicut eum
I feel happy again.	Iterum felix sentio.
But he did not leave the matter there.	Sed res ibi non reliquit.
I thought it was something	Putavi esse aliquid
I didn't tell you that	Non dixi vobis quod
I didn't think that much before	Non putavi quod multo ante
He's gone tomorrow today.	Hic hodie cras abiit.
He could do something.	Posset et facere aliquid.
Someone to.	Aliquis ad.
Well, that's better than nothing.	Bene, id est melius quam nihil.
we have it.	illud habemus.
And in a.	Et a.
I wonder why	Miror cur id
Nothing is so true.	Nihil tam verum est.
I could see or hear something	Non potui videre vel audire aliquid
It does not please.	Non placet.
Not this year, though.	Non eo anno, sed.
It's also hard to want to be at home.	Etiam difficile est domi esse velle.
We are nothing.	Nihil sumus.
It was late this year.	Sero hoc anno fuit.
And if not.	Et nisi.
We can do this better.	Hoc melius facere possumus.
I hope you're completely	Spero te omnino
It used to be.	Solebat.
I can't say what you think	Non possum dicere quid cogitat
You don't want to know already.	Jam non vis scire.
I have seen it again already this time	Vidi iterum iam hoc tempore
I doubt whether you know anything at all	Dubito an aliquid omnino scit
I'm afraid to tell you	Vereor tibi dicere
now I don't know what to say.	nunc quid dicam nescio.
Nothing was done without him.	Nihil sine illo factum est.
I'm not sure how to act	Non certus sum quomodo agere
I'm also thinking about this.	Ego quoque hoc cogitas.
I am thinking about it	Ego sum cogitare de illo
And now he is gone.	Et nunc abiit.
We never wanted to do it	Nos numquam volui facere eam
I could not have	Non potui habere
But it was said as if it had not been said.	Sed dictum ut nisi id dictum.
Yes in there is none.	Etiam in est nulla.
It was similar.	Similis fuit.
I want better for you both	Volo melius tibi utrumque
Tell him now.	Dic modo ei.
I want people to know who is mine	Volo homines scire quae est mea
We are not together.	Non simul sumus.
I heard him talking about him	Audivi eum de illo
I was lucky.	Fui felix.
I couldn't believe I was doing this	Non potui credere me hoc facere
I do a lot of that	Ego multum facere quod
Don't talk to me anymore about this.	Noli iam me de hoc loqui .
You tell us.	Tu nobis dic.
This finally is.	Hoc tandem est.
I'm not quite sure what to say	Non satis certus sum quid dicam
don't do it	Non faciam illud
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
Let him go there.	Eat ibi.
I can do this	Possum per hoc
I can still love it	Non possum etiam amo eam
I can't do another one like that	Non possum facere aliud unum sicut quod
I respect something	Ego quantum ad aliquid
but only today.	sed solum hodie.
He was well.	Bene erat.
I didn't know what to do with it	Ego nesciebam quid faciam cum illa
He said this	Hoc dixit
I couldn't say you didn't know me	Non potui dicere non scivi mihi
Great for me.	Magna mihi.
No he is not himself.	Nulla non ipsum est.
I don't know whether to choose	Nescio an velit
I can do what you want	Non possum facere quod vis
I want to be that person	Volo esse quod homo est
He was in school.	In schola erat.
I couldn't help him	Et non potui eum
Don't do this to me	Non hoc mihi
I never thought of anything	Numquam cogitavi aliquid ex eo
I hope all is well.	Spero bene.
And I want to go with you.	Volo autem tecum ire.
But this was not true.	Sed hoc non erat verum.
It was very late.	Sero admodum factum est.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
I used to buy everything in there	Ego eram emere omnia in ibi
This was that boy.	Hic erat ille puer.
I didn't want to talk about it.	Nolui loqui de illo.
I'll tell her one day.	Dicam ei unum diem.
I thought better of you.	Melius de te putavi.
He said not enough.	Parum dixit.
It's time to do something.	Aliquam id aliquam est.
I just want to see what you can	EGO iustus volo videre quid potes
I make him.	Ego illum fac.
but I was not at work	Ego autem non erat ad opus
I tried to do something like this	Conatus facere aliquid simile hoc
Now that's how.	Nunc id est quam.
It will not be enough for all.	Non satis erit omnibus.
I'm afraid, he thought.	Vereor, putabat.
I wish you already know.	Utinam iam scis.
I want to get there together	Volo illuc in una
It's time to get away from the game.	Aliquam a velit est.
No one is trying to tell you just not trying too hard.	Nemo conatur dicere te modo non satis difficile conatur.
It was something.	Erat aliquid.
I want to talk to him	Volo dicere ei
But neither was he willing.	Sed nec velit erat.
He wanted to stay.	Vellet manere.
This should not be done.	Hic non debet.
He did not.	Non fecit.
It's not quite true.	Non satis verum est.
I can't believe he's mine	Non possum credere illum meum esse
I know you don't	Scio te non facere
I doubt this.	Hoc dubito.
She could not say correctly.	Posset dicere non recte.
To sort as well	Ut genus ut bene
He said you did it.	Dixit fecisti.
We all wanted to live	Nos omnes volui vivere
But that never was.	Sed id numquam erat.
Nothing could have been done from it.	Nihil ex eo fieri potuit.
you're this time.	tu hoc tempus.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
I'll do what you want	Faciam quod vis
I didn't want to go to this school	Nolui ire ad hanc scholam
i'm a lot	Multum sum
But today we are here.	Sed hodie hic sumus.
We're not long.	Non diu sumus.
Maybe he didn't.	Fortasse non habuit.
It is time to time out.	Aliquam sit amet tempus ex.
I love this.	Hoc amo.
But there was something.	Erat aliquid sed.
You are not.	Non es.
I've done the work myself	Ego feci opus me
You don't need to have an affair.	Non opus est tibi habere rem.
But no one.	Sed quis nulla.
That's not what to do.	Quod facere non est.
He did what he did.	Faciens fecit.
I'll tell you what I had	Dicam quod habui
But now it's not enough.	Sed iam non satis est.
It's you.	Suus vobis.
I knew what else to be	Sciebam quid aliud esse
He thinks of him.	Putat eum.
It appears to be necessary.	Videtur opus esse.
Either way it's going to happen.	Utrumque futurum est.
Which was better.	Quod melius erat.
Listen to those who listen to it.	Id qui audire audire.
It's time to take the time.	Aliquam ut tempus est.
And it does not.	Et non habet.
I can't say why she left	Non possum dicere quare haec reliquit
I've never seen her like this.	Nunquam ita vidi eam.
I could barely see.	Vix videre potui.
I really don't want to believe that	Ego vere noluit credere quod
I don't want to get a chance	Non vis accipere forte
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum quam.
I can't say no to you	Non possum dicere, nec tibi
Maybe that was before.	Aliquam id erat ante.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
For years now.	Ad annos nunc.
As far as I can see	Quantum ad me videre possum
Not only that.	Non solum id.
I have work to do	Ego autem opus facere
I don't need you anything	Non debeo tibi quicquam
But as stated above.	Sed ut dictum est.
I don't want to go to it	Non vis ire ad illud
I want it.	ego eam.
I feel bad for not being together	Sentio malum quod non esse simul
Never, never, never.	Numquam, numquam, numquam.
I've been for a long time	Fui diu
But that was said from.	Sed id dictum ex.
He knew how to talk to people.	Sciebat loqui homines.
It's something else.	Est aliquid aliud.
I can't find it now.	Id nunc invenire non possum.
No one comes to me.	Nemo ad me venit.
I have a lot of money	Ego multum pecuniae
I know how to get there	Scio quomodo illuc
This is the same thing.	Hoc idem.
i want to see you again.	iterum videre volo.
This I told you to come	Hoc dixi vobis venire
I just had to do it longer.	Modo id facere diutius.
as you said	sicut dixisti
It will do well.	Bene facturus est.
It was scarcely possible.	Vix erat.
I knew there was something	Sciebam ibi esse aliquid
I don't have anything to say	Ego non habeo aliquid dicere
It's too good.	Nimis bonus est.
I need to get into it	Mihi opus est ut in eam
i am really sick.	Ego vere male.
You should have.	Debes habere.
We got your name.	Nomen tuum, nos obtinuit.
I've never heard this happen before.	Nunquam ante hoc factum audivi.
I hope as soon as possible.	Spero quam primum.
It ought to be so.	Ita esse debet.
You're gonna act right.	Tu amet recte agere.
I'm sure you've always been	Ego certe non semper fuisse
I know it can be done	Scio fieri
I think that was the name.	Puto id nomen fuisse.
Not at all	Non est omnino
I will not speak to him.	Dicam ei nec.
I can't go back to it.	Ire ad eam non possum.
That's how good we can be.	Id est quam bonum esse possumus.
I could not leave him alone.	Eum solum relinquere non potui.
We're going to be out of this.	Ex hoc futurum sumus.
And I saw him.	Et vidi eum.
I just wanted him not to be	Ego iustus voluit eum non esse
I didn't know what to do about it but	Ego nesciebam quid de eo facerem, sed
I'm sorry for that decision	Nunc paenitet me quod consilium
I never even told him my real name	Numquam etiam ad eum meum verum nomen
That could be said either way.	Id vel modo dixi posse.
After this he was.	Post haec erat.
I hope you can	Spero autem quod potes
I thought of everything	Cogitavi omnia
I can't say it.	Non possum dicere eam.
But that is not enough.	Sed id parum est.
i think you do	Puto te ipsum facere
I'm not sure what it was	Non certus sum quid esset
This was not enough.	Hoc non erat satis.
I want to do	Volo facere
I would like to know him	Vellem scire eum
Boy! 	Puer!
I didn't know something like that	Ego nesciebam aliquid simile quod fuit
I could not do this without you	Hoc sine te non potui mihi facere
But that's not good.	Sed id non bene.
I can't live that way	Non possum vivere illuc
I don't know whether it is true.	Nescio an verum sit.
What you can't have, you don't want that for me.	Quod habere non potes, illa mihi non vis.
There was nothing wrong at all.	Nihil omnino mali fuit.
That was not.	Quod non fuit.
I will love you and will always be	Ego amo te et semper erit
He thought it would be like going home.	Putabat simile domi fore.
I appreciate your help	Ut bene auxilium tuum
as and when.	sicut et quando.
Not I.	Non ego.
That's only for you.	Id solum tibi.
Very much indeed.	Valde quidem.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
Well that's no longer.	Bene id nulla iam.
I couldn't believe it had never been my boyfriend	Non potui credere quod nunquam fuit meum,
Something else too.	Aliud quoque.
I just bought it.	Modo emit eam.
I want you to say nothing	Volo te dicere nihil
I'm afraid of doing it	Vereor ne fecerit
Don't post today.	Non post hodie.
This is his time.	Hoc est suum tempus.
But not here.	Sed non hic.
I don't know what could be happening.	Quid id fieri possit nescio.
I thought nothing about him.	nihil de eo cogitavi.
as I myself.	ut ego ipse.
What he did not say.	Quod non dixit.
don't talk about it	Non loqui eam
Looks like you are now.	Similis nunc es.
I never cum just like I did when	Ego numquam cum sicut fecit me cum
It could be something, really.	Posset esse aliquid, vere.
Certainly he does not know these things quite correctly.	Certe haec non satis recte novit.
I can't help you with this one	Non possum tibi hoc unum
I told him when I could leave	Dixi ei quando relinquere posset
I think we all win	Puto non omnes vincere
I don't want to say anything else	Non vis dicere aliquid aliud
He loves me.	Me amat.
I need this.	hoc mihi opus est.
He has his own room.	Cubiculum suum habet.
I have seen everything.	Vidi omnia.
Not well.	Non bene.
That'd be good.	Id bonum esse velis.
Let him go with you.	Eat tecum.
This is going to happen to us.	Hoc futurum est nobis.
But that's never the same thing.	Sed id ipsum numquam.
Do something.	Fac aliquid.
yet I could not.	adhuc non potui.
Thus we are.	Sic nos.
I do not know.	Nescio.
I hope it won't be hard	Spero non esse difficile
What a question.	Quae quaestio.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
I can help you and help you	Non possum adiuvare me et te adiuvet
I don't know how we can do it.	Nescio quomodo id facere possumus.
This has not been done.	Hoc non est factum.
It can be done easily.	Fieri potest, facile.
But it was time.	Sed tempus erat.
I hope you're doing well.	Spero te bene.
I think that's enough	Puto quod satis est
Tell her what you want.	Dic ei quod vis.
I thought they were friends	Putabam se esse amicos
I did exactly that.	Prorsus id feci.
I have something to do now	Habeo aliquid facere nunc
I appreciate your help and your support	Ut bene auxilium tuum et auxilium tuum
What's it like over there.	Quid simile ibi.
He is also here with us.	Etiam hic nobiscum est.
I wanted to stay a little longer	manere paulo diutius volui
I did my work today	Ego feci meum opus est hodie
I won't do it this time	Non faciam hoc tempore
I knew it was hard	Sciebam difficile esse
This is not working.	Hoc non opus est.
I'll go to it	Ego te ad eam
It has not.	Sic non habet.
I am nothing for you	Nihil sum vobis
I can't even believe he did it for me	Credere ne quidem possum quod ad me fecit
I tried to give you everything	Conatus sum dare tibi omnia
I could not hear.	Audire non potui.
I can't give you help.	Auxilium tibi dare non possum.
not anything	Non quicquam
All this is necessary.	Hoc totum opus est.
No, always none.	Nulla, semper nulla.
I wanted him, all of him	Eum volui, omnes eum
It doesn't have to be me.	Non habet ut me.
I knew exactly what it was	Sciebam prorsus quid esset
Unfortunately I wanted to see you again	Male volui te videre iterum
That's gonna be us.	Id amet nobis.
It was way better than that.	Melius esse erat modo.
That was a great thing	Quod erat magna res
She makes more money than us.	Plus pecuniae facit illa quam nos.
I am satisfied with it	Ego satis ex eo
But the time will come.	Sed futurum tempus est.
I am ready for him	Ego paratus sum pro eo
I don't think it's possible	Non puto posse
He wants to do better	Melius se facere vult
You know.	Scis.
I know everything	Ego novi omnia
But he wants it to be said.	Sed id dictum velit.
Actually I do.	Vere facio.
This year not so much.	Hoc anno non ita multum.
I always didn't know	Semper nesciebam
I knew this was going to happen	Sciebam hoc futurum
None in it was great.	Nulla in erat magna.
I never knew who he was	Numquam sciebat quis esset
Yes that's only out.	Etiam id nisi ex.
It should be okay.	Sit bene.
Please don't have it.	Placet enim non habere.
I could not do it myself	Non potui me facere
The dog too.	Canis quoque.
I just want the money	Ego iustus volo pecuniam
He was not good enough.	Non erat satis ipse.
Not very long and not much.	Non multum diu quod non multum.
We don't have one race at the same time.	Unum genus simul non habemus.
This will take some time.	Id ipsum aliquam tempus.
I wanted the same thing	Idem volui
He has not.	Non habet.
There are three.	Tres sunt.
My dad definitely wanted us there.	Pater meus certus ibi nos voluit.
I wanted one.	unum me volui.
I don't know anything about it either	Nescio quid de illo vel
I only want to be well	Tantum volo ut bene sit
i'm good at that.	Sum bonus eo.
I have to get something from him	Habeo ut res ab eo
I think people are prepared.	Puto homines paratus.
Really, really good.	Vere, vere bonum est.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Nihil mali esse.
Get everything ready.	Quae paratus ut.
I will say this much.	Dicam hoc multa.
I just want to understand it	EGO iustus volo intelligere eam
He could see, but could not reach it.	Videre potuit, sed ad eam non potuit.
I find it hard to travel	Ut difficile iter invenire eam
I know what that means	Scio quid illa per
It is not nothing, but it is not something.	Non nihil, sed non est aliquid.
Yes, it was somebody.	Etiam, erat quis.
I am not so glad	Non sum et gaudeo
I just can't believe it.	Modo non possum credere.
I can't do it either	Non possum facere ad utrumque
I don't know how it never was.	Nescio quomodo numquam fuit.
And yet!.	Et tamen !.
All I can do in all	Omnia possum facere in omnibus
I can't do anything wrong	Non possum facere quicquam mali
I can't say more than	Non possum dicere plus quam
As you are for me	Ut non sunt ad me
You know or say something.	Scis, vel aliquid loqui.
I don't have time to go now	Non tempus ut iam
I barely saw anything	Vix vidi quicquam
You need to talk to him.	Eum loqui debes.
He is not like us.	Non est nobis similis.
And for you.	Et tibi.
we can do many things.	quod multa fieri possumus.
i want to talk to you	volo tecum loqui
I have not heard my name	non audivi nomen meum
Things are not looking good for us.	Res non sunt nobis vultus bona.
I know who your family is	Scio qui tua est
i thought we were going to stop.	putabam nos prohibere.
Think about it.	Cogitare de illo.
That's not the only thing.	Quod non est solum.
Now it wasn't him.	Nunc non ipsum erat.
I want to help a lot.	Volo auxilium amet.
I just want to get it from me	Ego iustus volo ut eam a me
I wonder where he is	Miror ubi est
I couldn't think of it too much	Non potui cogitare de hoc nimis
As it is, we can do nothing really.	Ut est, vere nihil possumus.
This, however, has not yet been done.	Hoc tamen nondum factum est.
Nothing new about him	Nihil novi de eo
I have everything tonight	Habeo omnia hac nocte
I think that's what I mean about you	Puto id quod vult de te
Home, wife.	Domum, uxorem.
This should only be done.	Hoc modo debet fieri.
Tell me not you.	Dic mihi non te.
There was no better way to find out.	Non erat melius invenire.
I do the same	Facio ipsum ipsum
I'm trying to do it again	Iterum me facere conatur
I knew this was not possible, but	Scivi hoc non posse, sed
He wanted to play with us the whole time.	Totum tempus ludere nobiscum vellet.
Nothing to do with it.	Eius nihil facere.
I couldn't think of anything	Non potui cogitare quid
He didn't know if it was time.	Nesciebat si tempus.
Which in itself is enough.	Quod per se satis est.
So we both go.	Sic ambo ire.
I love her look	Amo vultus eius
We didn't say anything to each other.	Non aliquid inter nos dicere.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
I know he is gone.	Abiit scio.
It's too much for me.	Nimium est mihi.
But the boy is gone.	Sed puer abiit.
He says that he did not know.	Dicit se nescire.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
And there we are.	Et ibi sumus.
To help her with it	Ad auxilium eius cum eo
We can only get so much.	Tantum accipere possumus tantum.
I think they are still men	Puto tamen, homines sunt
I hope you really love it	Spero te vere amo eam
I know what it is to live here.	Scio quid sit hic vivere.
I just couldn't say this.	Modo hoc dicere non potui.
I just don't know enough.	Modo satis nescio.
Really want something for you	Vere volo quod pro vobis
The situation is the same.	Sic se res habet.
I can't think of anything else to do	Non possum cogitare de aliud facere
i am really sorry	Ego vere paenitet
You don't want it to hurt	Non vis eam ad malum
I made it on time	Me fecit illud in tempore
You know what you are doing.	Scis quid facias.
The father is always great.	Pater semper magna.
And here they are.	Et hic sunt.
I'm not sure why.	Non sum certus quare.
He never, never was here for me.	Nunquam ille, nunquam huc ad me fuit.
not there for you	Non ibi te
I haven't ever told you about it	Non umquam dixi de illo
This is not possible.	Hoc modo fieri non potest.
Not only to do this	Non solum hoc facere
But we too.	Sed nos quoque.
Which indeed has been done.	Quod quidem factum est.
I just wasn't entirely sure what it was	Ego iustus non erat omnino certus quod erat
And this was not.	Et hoc non erat.
I want to be like her	Volo esse sicut eam
I'm never sure	Ego certe numquam
This would not be one.	Hoc non esset unum.
SO.	SIC.
but he himself.	sed ipse.
There was nothing but to speak.	Nihil erat nisi loqui.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
I was always so, even as a child	Ita semper fui, etiam ut puer
Maybe it was true.	Fortasse verum fuit.
By doing this alone	Facerem solum
Again he did not see me, he did not speak with me.	Iterum me non vidit, mecum non loqui.
I certainly didn't want it	Ego certe noluit eam
He knows.	Scit.
And that's it.	Id et eius.
She's just gone.	Illa mox abiit.
The father never has time for us.	Pater numquam tempus habet pro nobis.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I want to be that man	Volo esse quod homo
They often play together.	Saepe simul ludere.
I can't be sick	Non possum esse male
There was no tomorrow.	Cras in nulla erat.
You are that man.	Tu ille vir.
It will be very hard for you.	Admodum difficile erit tibi.
I want this.	Hoc volo.
never let me down in that	numquam me in eo
He thought he knew everything about him.	Omnia de se scire putabat.
That's gonna be great.	Ut sit amet magna.
I can't see anything at all	Non possum videre aliquid omnino videtur
Great, great, great.	Magna, magna, magna.
I didn't know either	Nesciebam vel
all who love you	Omnes qui amo te
I made you	Me fecit tibi
All he knew for sure was his name.	Omnes scivit pro certo nomen eius fuisse.
I don't know anything about him.	Nihil de eo nescio.
I want to make him so happy too	Volo facere eum ut felix nimis
I will tell them all tomorrow	Dicam omnes cras
He would not do this.	Hoc non facturum.
I could not come by	Non potui venire per
Sure, it's all.	Certo, omnibus est.
i knew you'd like	Scivi tibi velis
She could go on for a long time.	DiU posset ire.
Seems to be working.	Opus esse videtur.
Men are men.	Homines sunt homines sunt.
But there was nothing new.	Sed nihil novi erat.
And perhaps he does.	Et fortasse facit.
I knew exactly what it was tonight	Prorsus sciebam quid esset hac nocte
I told him	Non indicavit ei
I was told that it would help	Dictum est mihi quod esset auxilium
I think you need to come with us	Puto opus venire nobiscum est
But that was before	Sed id erat ante
She gave me good.	Illa mihi dedit bonum.
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
I haven't seen him here tonight	Non vidi eum hic hac nocte
There will be no more.	Non erit amplius.
I just don't know what else to do.	Modo nescio quid aliud facere.
I thought you wanted to talk too	Cogitavi velle loqui, etiam
However she told me something.	Tamen aliquid non indicavit mihi.
I wanted to talk to her.	Loqui volui ad eam.
I couldn't believe it	Non potui credere eam esse
None of it was.	Nulla a enim erat.
I will certainly be more	Ego certe plus esse
I don't care where.	Nolo ubi.
This is your job.	Tuum est officium.
Don't get too much.	Noli nimis accipere.
I don't know what to do.	Quid id faciam nescio.
I could not do it	Non potui facere
don't talk to him	Non loqui ei
I have to think about it	Habeo cogitare de illo
That's what you do.	Id quod facis.
I only want to talk to you	Tantum volo loqui ad vos
He was still there.	Ibi adhuc erat.
Not only good.	Non solum bonum.
I could do it for sure	Ego certe facere potui
He was always there.	Ibi semper erat.
Whether he likes it or not.	Vel an velit.
But that's a great time.	Sed id tempus magna.
No, no, not us.	Non, non, non nobis.
I told you	Dixi vobis
I know the truth	Me scire verum
I did not do anything wrong	Nec quicquam mali feci
He does so.	Ita facit.
I was there at last	Ibi eram, tandem
I can't anymore	Non possum amplius
I won't be here	Ego me non esse hic
I can't do anything with a lot of things	Non possum facere aliquid ex multum
As it was.	Ut erat.
And he said yes	Et dixit sic
I could still see	Adhuc videre potui
But not enough.	Sed non satis.
That has just been done.	Quod modo factum est.
By the time	Ad tempus.
I hope it's good	Spero bonum
It is important that you are as before.	Aliquam sit amet quam ut ante.
I probably never will	Ego probabiliter numquam erit
I see you all	Ego te, totum
I could not understand what he meant by me	Non potui intelligere quid a me vellet
I will do better this time	Faciam melius hoc tempore
I'm done.	Im feci.
Not anything	Nec quicquam
Make sure you're busy.	Vide sis occupatus.
I could not understand that	Non potui intelligere quod
I think he even said the same thing.	Puto etiam hoc ipsum dixisse.
I think this will be different	Puto hoc non aliud erit
I did for him.	Ego feci pro eo.
Which cannot be true.	Quod verum esse non potest.
I need to make some money before we leave	Mihi opus est facere pecuniam ante nos relinquere
I don't know you.	Non novi te.
This is going to be a good time.	Hoc futurum tempus bonum.
I don't know who it is	Nescio quis sit
I can help you through it	Non possum adiuvare vos per illum
Yes, that was difficult.	Etiam id erat difficile.
I don't want to talk more about it.	Nolo amplius de eo loqui.
He likes you.	Velit te.
But that day certainly did not.	Sed illo certe die non fecit.
Not long gone	Non diu abiit
I didn't know what to believe anymore	Ego nesciebam quid credere amplius
I heard nothing more	Nihil audivi amplius
That has not been done before.	Quod non ante factum est.
I don't have a reason for this to happen	Non habeo cur hoc factum sit
I could not accept that.	Quod accipere non potui.
to receive.	ACCIPERE.
I thought everything was okay	Cogitavi omnia bene
I really like it for sure	Ego vere amo eam certe
This is similar.	Hoc simile est.
I was with him in that	Fui cum eo in illo
When you want something, just say it.	Cum vis aliquid, dic modo.
Yes that was great.	Etiam id erat magna.
Not her home yet	Non tamen eam in domum suam
I can't stay here anymore	Non possum hic amplius manere
I can hear.	Audire possum.
I could come to him.	Potuit me venire ad se.
It was a happy day for me.	Felix dies erat mihi.
I hope you like	Spero ut placet
The father said.	Pater dixit.
You have everything.	Habes omnia'.
not her one	Non eam unum
I hope you're well.	Spero te bene esse.
I really don't want this	Ego vere noluit hoc
so sorry.	ita me paenitet.
Look at what's happened.	Vide quid acciderit.
He was with him.	Erat cum illo.
That's what I always do.	Ut id semper enim.
I saw him yesterday.	eum heri vidi.
At length he came to help.	Tandem ad auxilium venit.
I believe you have said enough.	Satis credo te dixisse.
I hope that's the case	Spero, quod sibi
I knew nothing of what he meant	nihil sciebam quid vellet
I need to talk about it	Mihi opus est dicere de illo
Always have something to say	Semper habere aliquid dicere
No will, no need.	Non vult, non opus est.
I have nothing to say here	Nihil habeo quod dicam hic
From someone.	Ab aliquo.
I know people very well	Scio homines optime
I just thought that you want to know.	Modo cogitavi ut vis scire.
I can't see it there	Non possum videre eam ibi
This has just been said.	Hoc modo dictum est.
I was lucky to get out of it	Felix essem ut ex eo
I said I just need to give him this money	Dixi modo necesse est ei hanc pecuniam dare
It is not yet too late.	Nondum nimis sero est.
i think i know she doesn't live long	Puto scire se non diu vivere
Good to see you all here.	Bene te hic omnes videre.
You have to know.	Scire habes.
I can't speak.	Non possum dicere.
Things started well.	Res bene incepit.
Truly it was done.	Vere factum est.
He's getting hard.	Ille difficile questus est.
Not this year.	Non hoc anno.
He thought a little about it.	Parum putabat in eam.
I've never been married	Ego numquam uxorem
In this way, it is better now.	Hoc modo, modo melius est.
I never heard more of him	Numquam amplius de eo audivi
I could see the action	Non potui videre opus est
I got one.	Obtinuit me unus.
I wanted to believe him	Credere volui ei
I've done it.	Ego feci.
I have many things to do	Habeo multa facere
I just knew it could be me	Ego iustus scivi non posse esse in me
This has not been done for me.	Non hoc mihi factum est.
It could be great.	Posset magna.
It was a great story.	Aliquam a magna erat.
But here's the thing.	Sed hic rem.
I didn't know who it was	Nesciebam quis esset
Out! 	E!
You can't have it.	Non potes habere.
We have to do so too.	Habemus etiam id.
And before him.	Et ante ipsum.
We are to help.	Adiuvare nos sumus.
I've seen it before.	Ego ante vidi.
As for i love you	Sicut enim te amo
I told you this I know but it was not	dixi tibi hoc scio sed non fuit
I can't do this without you.	Sine te hoc facere non possum.
I am not one.	non sum unus.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
None of this is true.	Nihil ex hoc verum est.
I didn't get any out.	Ut non aliquam ex.
I need to do this	Mihi opus est ad hoc per
I don't like it.	Non ut est.
I don't know what it is.	Quid sit, nescio.
I don't already have money	Non iam pecuniam
I'm someone else.	Im aliquis.
said: you know you have a good time.	dixit: scis te habere bene.
Enough for me	Mihi satis est
And he went away.	Et abiit.
I respect the decision	Vereor consilium
I really shouldn't be	Ego vere non esset
No one knew why.	Cur nemo scivit.
I wanted to think on what day it would be	Cogitare volui quo die esset
We don't have anything to say.	Non habemus aliquid dicere.
I'm done with it.	Ego feci cum illo.
I want as much as possible	Volo autem quantum fieri potest
I can see how happy you are here	Quam felix hic es videre possum
Not attempted	Non conatus est
i wanted to know why.	scire volui cur.
I am everything you can be	Ego sum omnia potes esse
I could not act.	Non potui agere.
I heard something again.	Aliquid adhuc audivi.
He has everything.	Omnia habet.
It is your future decision making.	Consilium tuum futurum est faciens.
Something else you don't need.	Aliquid aliud non opus est.
It's for you.	Suus vobis .
i know you know.	scio te scis.
Where or where was he?	Ubi vel erat.
I have seen nothing at all about him	Nihil omnino vidi de illo
It's up to you really.	Est ad te vere.
I could help someone	Adiuvare aliquem potui
Unable to do anything.	Posset facere aliquid.
I want to see him	Volo videre eum
I never did anything in the morning.	Numquam quicquam mane.
I just walked away from him	Ego iustus abiit ab eo
He wants to come to you	Non vult venire ad vos ut
I don't know why here	Nescio cur hic
He is truly there.	Vere ibi est.
I am glad for you.	Ego pro gaudeo.
But as it was.	Sed ut erat.
I could not say for sure	Non potui dicere pro certo
what? 	quid?
Is it you? 	estne tu?
which I could never do.	quod facere nunquam potui.
I think you can see that's true	Puto videre potes quod verum est
must be done.	Faciendum est.
I was ready for this	Hoc paratus eram
I hope you plan to do good with it	Spero te cogitas facere bona cum eo
I just can't do anything here.	Modo aliquid hic facere non potest.
And this is enough.	Et hoc satis.
This was very bad.	Hoc erat valde malum.
I didn't know you in you	Ego nesciebam te in te
It was something indeed.	Erat aliquid quidem.
I think we have something new	Puto nos habere aliquid novi
I couldn't speak late	Non potui dicere nuper
I only had one husband yet	Ego tantum quod unus vir cum adhuc
It is also very important.	Etiam sit amet magna ipsum.
All of us.	Omnes nos.
I don't have time to	Non tempus ut
It's not so hard for me.	Mihi non ita est.
Not so in you	Non ita sit in te
You can also have money.	Pecuniam quoque habere potes.
I love you	Quod amo te
I am getting used to it.	Questus sum ad eam.
Absolutely didn't know what it was	Omnino nesciebam quid esset
It's kind of bad.	Malum genus.
I didn't want to be alone	Nolui esse solus
I could not believe this.	Credere hoc non potui.
I thought pretty good	Cogitavi satis bonum
This is not easy.	Hoc non est facile.
I just never let up on anything	Ego iustus numquam eum ad aliquid
I saw him	Vidi illum
You think about yourself and everything you want.	De te omnia cogitas, et quae vis.
It's not enough, you know.	Parum est, scis.
I know how to do it	Scio quomodo facturus sit
I want to talk about our future	Volo dicere de nobis futurum
It didn't seem to us at all.	Nobis omnino non videbatur.
Never much else.	Numquam aliud multo.
I feel this way too.	Ita hoc quoque sentio.
I can't speak.	Non possum dicere.
He was alone.	Solus erat.
Probably nothing, but certainly not possible.	Verisimiliter nihil, sed certe non potest.
I didn't see it so much	Non tantum videre eam
I could not do anything.	Non potui aliquid facere.
I told him there was no need	Dixi ei nihil opus esse
And you're right.	Et tu recte.
You can't be sure.	Non potes esse certe.
I don't want anything.	Nolo quicquam.
Maybe it was nothing.	Fortasse nihil erat.
One here and one there.	Unus hic et unus ibi.
You can truly trust one.	Credere tibi vere potes unum.
I truly believe she loves me	Ego vere credo me amat
Of the night	De nocte.
I didn't know about her	Ego nesciebam de eius
That was not exactly true.	Quod non prorsus verum fuit.
nothing of him.	Nihil eius.
That seems to work.	Quod opus videtur.
Where was he now?	Ubi nunc erat?.
You have time and money.	Habes tempus et pecuniam.
I wanted to be here for you	Hic esse volui tibi
See if you don't have.	Vide si non habes.
I feel so sick to it	Sentio tam male ad eam
I am so happy for him to be at home	Ego tam felix sibi esse domi
Here they are.	Hic sunt.
He did not say much, nor even gave a name.	Non multa dixit, ne nomen quidem dedit.
And rightly indeed.	Et recte quidem.
He only does his job.	Qui solum suum officium facit.
Nothing is to be alone.	Nihil est solum esse.
But not much.	Sed non multum.
I never thought	Nunquam putavi
I am not someone anymore.	Mihi non amplius aliquis.
I don't want to go any further	Non amplius ire volo
I guess that's a bad day	Suspicor quod dies mali
I think it's enough.	satis esse puto.
I just didn't want to talk	Ego iustus noluit loqui
I didn't know what he meant by me	Ego nesciebam quid a me vellet
There is no tomorrow.	Cras non est est.
I just want to work	Ego iustus volo ad opus
Boy, you have a lot here.	Puer, multum hic habes.
He didn't want to go to school today.	Hodie ad scholam ire noluit.
It was certainly never.	Non erat certe umquam.
It used to be pretty.	Satis esse solebat.
I could not do this	Hoc facere non potui
Maybe you're not.	Fortasse non es.
I was sure of it	Fui certus ex eo,
but now he knew better.	sed melius nunc sciebat.
I need to do something	Mihi opus est facere aliquid
I want you to have it first	Volo te habere illud primum
He made me.	Fecit me.
Always do more than you know.	Semper id plus quam scis.
I think it's just barely.	Puto modo vix est.
We don't have a lot of money.	Non multum pecuniae habemus.
I hope so soon	Spero fore ut mox
Never have to deal with him again	Nunquam mihi agere cum illo iterum
I could not speak to me	Non potui dicere me
I hope you stay with us.	Spero te nobiscum manere.
I know him very well	Scio eum optime
I'm not sure if I could do it	Ego certe non potui si facere
He came to him.	Venit ad eum.
It could never be	Numquam fieri potuit
I'm always ready now	Semper paratus sum nunc
I don't know the day.	Nescio diem.
I think.	Puto.
The situation is the same.	ita se res habet.
I want to go home too	Volo ire in domum suam etiam
Something new?.	Aliquid novi?.
How lucky I was to be	Ut essem felix esse
As if.	Ut si.
I know you can do well	Scio te bene facere potes
He did it for me.	Is mihi fecit.
I didn't know what else to say	Ego nesciebam quid aliud dicere
I can't quite believe that myself	Ego non possum satis credere quod ipse
I hope you will get it	Spero fore ut eam
Please, please, no more.	Quaeso, quaeso, amplius.
I don't know why I can't just say the truth	Nescio cur non solum verum dicere
It is not the same as	Non sit idem quod
I want to go thither.	illuc ire volo.
You can go in and out.	Potes ire et in.
Truly he is gone.	Vere abiit.
I know what's in it for you.	Ego quid in eo est tibi.
I don't mean to be like that	Non vult esse simile quod
But not before.	Sed non ante.
Which is true.	Quod est verum.
You don't have anything.	Non habes aliquid.
I love it too.	Ego etiam illud amo.
But that's e.	Sed id e.
I need to be with him	Mihi opus est ut cum eo
I couldn't get it anymore	Non potui amplius accipere eam
I like being alone a lot	Mihi placet non solum multum
It was a good decision for me.	Bonum consilium a me fuit.
I want to see it all now	Volo eam videre omnia nunc
So he is with us.	Ita est nobiscum.
We're still all together.	Fac nos adhuc omnia simul.
Everything about that.	Omnia ut.
I can't do that	Non possum me facere quod
This is what I thought.	Hoc est quod putavit.
I don't even know how	Ego ne quidem scio quomodo
I can give you something	Non possum dare tibi aliquid
Too good, probably.	Nimis bene, probabiliter.
I just need to know	Ego iustus opus est scire
I could always tell the truth	Semper verum dicere potui
This time does not stop.	Hoc tempore non prohibere.
I can come to talk to him tomorrow	Cras possum venire ad eum loqui
Many.	Multum.
But I hope not much longer.	Sed spero non multo diutius.
Say what's wrong.	Dic quid mali.
We can't do it.	Non possumus facere.
I can't make it for a long time	Non possum eam diu
It was probably a lot.	Probabiliter multum fuit.
What was done there, I do not know, but something.	Quid ibi factum sit, non scio, sed aliquid.
I was able to do it	Eram posse facere
But, please.	Sed, velit.
But it still seems to be a lot of things.	Sed tamen videtur multum.
I already know who he is	Iam scio quis est
Too much to do.	Nimium facere.
No, that was great.	Nulla id magna erat.
All I could understand	Omnia potui intelligere
To the first	Ad primum .
I do not believe.	Non credo.
After all I was a good boy	Post omnes fui, puer bonus
I'm pretty sure this was where you'd like to come	Ego satis certo hoc erat quo velis venire
I could not see you alone.	Te solum videre non potui.
I need to know what it was	Mihi opus est scire quid esset
But not from him.	Sed non ipsum ex.
I wanted and need help	Volui et opus auxilium
You have got to believe.	Habesne credere.
We don't have the money.	Pecuniam non habemus.
I wanted you to know	Volui te scire
I couldn't talk or anything.	Non potui loqui vel aliquid.
I told him years ago	Dixi ei annos
I'm done for you to help you	Ego feci tibi ut adiuvet te
I do this on my own	Hoc facio in mea
I think you believe that	Puto te credere quod
Attempted	Conatus est
I think we'll never know	Puto nos numquam scire
I just don't know what he was getting up to	Modo ne quid esset questus ad
He can't act anymore.	Non potest agere posse.
If not before.	Nisi ante.
He comes to me.	Venit ad me.
But this is about.	Sed haec de.
I thought it was better that way	Melius putavi illuc
No, not that.	Nulla non quam.
I don't know anything about me like that	Non novi aliquid de me sicut quod
I can travel.	Iter facere possum.
But about me, as you know everything.	De me autem, ut omnia scis.
I need you	Mihi opus est tibi
to him what I said.	ei quod dixi.
But often it really is.	Sed saepe vere est.
i think you looks good	Puto te spectat bonum
And he knew what he was doing.	Et sciebat quid faceret.
I wanted to be someone	Volui esse aliquem
But he also himself.	Sed et ipsum quam.
Certainly he knew that he was still there.	Certe sciebat eum adhuc ibi esse.
i can see in you.	videre possum in te.
Tonight she was certainly at home.	Hac certe nocte domi fuit.
I could not say that before	Non potui dicere quod ante
I never said anything	Numquam dixit aliquid
This will not happen.	Hoc non erit.
I've heard it now.	Audivi modo.
I just want you to think about it	Ego iustus volo te cogitare de illo
I need to do something.	Mihi opus est facere aliquid.
But no one comes to me.	Sed nemo ad me venit.
I know you can do it	Scio te facere potes
Was.	Esset.
It's not bad at all.	Non est omnino malum.
why should i say.	cur dicam.
This is what he loves to do.	Hoc est quod amat facere.
I don't really know that well	Non vere scio quod bene
You are a teacher and a teacher.	Magister et magister es.
Now you can't want something like that.	Iam non potes te velle aliquid simile.
You can do well.	Bene facere potes.
Look after me.	Vide post me.
i didn't think.	non putavi.
I can't do this wrong	Non possum hoc malum
for never.	numquam enim.
I wanted him to go by	Ego voluit eum ire per
And my father is gone.	Et pater meus abiit.
You can't do it most of the time.	Plus temporis facere non potes.
Time to think.	Tempus cogitare.
What time.	Quod tempus.
I think we all know that.	Omnes puto hoc scire.
I know what you like	Scio quid hoc tibi placet
I never wanted anyone to love him.	Numquam velit quis ipsum.
The same thing happened to me.	Simile quid acciderit mihi;
I don't know what is this	Nescio quid hoc
Please don't talk.	Loqui non placet.
It is not so for us.	Non ita est nobis.
Hardly any money	Vix aliquam pecuniam
Looks like you were yesterday.	Te heri similis.
No one knows everything.	Nemo omnia novit.
I can't get this anymore	Non possum amplius accipere hoc
But it is quite probable.	Sed satis probabile est.
I never thought	Numquam putavi
This has not been said.	Hoc non est dictum.
I want to say.	Dicere volo.
He knew this.	Sciebat hoc.
It is in us.	In nobis est.
We don't do it for us either.	Facere id nobis vel nobis non.
As of now.	Ut a nunc.
Do it yourself.	Fac tibi.
He says he needs to talk.	Dicit loqui necesse est.
Not long.	Non diu.
It looks good.	Bene spectat.
I was up to it	Eram ad eam
I want that.	Volo, quod.
I could not be enough	Non potui satis est
Now he was not sure.	Iam certus non erat.
I haven't seen you in a while	Non vidi in tempore
and to speak.	et loqui.
No no no great.	Nulla nec magna.
I didn't know where it was	Nesciebam quo esset
I am not surprised by this.	Non miror hoc.
I can't stay away from it any longer	Non possum manere ex eo iam non
I've been really busy	Ego vere fuit occupatus
I could see the name	Nomen videre potui
Nothing else I could do there	Nihil aliud facere potui cogitare ibi
But not before.	Sed non ante.
I'm afraid of what you mean	Vereor ne quid vis mali
I only want to stay	Volo tantum manere
I don't know what happened to him.	Nescio quid ei acciderit.
Which certainly wasn't good.	Quod certe non bene erat.
I just don't know how yet.	Modo nescio quomodo adhuc.
I will definitely do this again	Ego certe hoc iterum
He knew he was saying something more.	Sciebat se aliquid amplius dicere.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
No one sees me anymore.	Nemo me amplius.
Now more than ever before.	Nunc semper quam ante.
I just haven't had time for that	Ego iustus non habuit tempus illud
I knew it from him	Sciebam enim ex eo
Get something from you	Ut aliquid ex te
I also.	Ego quoque.
But as soon as possible.	Sed ut primum.
Well, now do it again.	Bene, nunc iterum fac.
I could only see	Non potui tantum videre
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
For he saw that you are.	Vidit enim quod es.
This afternoon I saw you	Haec post meridiem vidi te
I know it won't be tonight	Scio eum hac nocte non esse
You do better than that.	Facere te melius quam.
Nothing said yet to help.	Nihil dixit tamen ad auxilium.
i saw you do it.	vidi te facere.

Or perhaps.	Vel forsitan.
The work was done.	Opus erat.
It makes it difficult for us to find a job.	Facit difficile nobis officium invenire.

I want to be like you.	Volo esse sicut tu.
This does not mean.	Hoc non vult.
I don't want to be able to think	Nolo cogitare posse
Yes it is for you.	Ita est tibi.
I'll do everything right.	Ego omnia recte faciam.
Nothing else is the same.	Nihil aliud est simile.
I really don't need it now	Ego vere non opus est nunc

I was definitely there.	Certus eram ibi.
The best car is there.	Optime ibi currus est.
I wonder how long you've been here	Miror quam diu hic fuit
But do it quickly.	Sed fac cito.
I know you don't do anything about it	Scio te non aliquid de illo
I am always.	Semper ego sum.
I don't want to accept that	Nolo accipere quod
You know very well and very well.	Et tu scis, optime optime.
I want to talk a little with you	Volo enim parum loqui tecum
This he did in his time.	Hoc fecit in tempore suo.
She's not going to do that.	Illa non ad facere.
It was something.	Erat aliquid.
I can't find the truth	Non possum invenire verum
We're up to your job.	Ad officium tuum sumus.
I need your help, though.	Auxilium tuum mihi opus est, sed.
Wouldn't he say it?	Utinam non dixit ei
I wonder where he is	Miror ubi est
I knew why he was here	Sciebam cur hic esset
I couldn't stop for a moment	Non potui prohibere in tempore
He was certainly not alone.	Solus certe non erat.
But nothing is to be done.	Sed fieri nihil est.
Both are necessary.	Utrumque opus est.
Three in front of him.	Tres ante eum.
Time to say so much.	Tempus tantum dicam.
I know someone gave up on me	Scio te aliquis dedit usque ad me
Now this.	Hic nunc.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
I was absolutely wrong about it	Omnino mali essem de eius
. 	.
. 	.
. 	.
. 	.
. 	.
. 	.
But he knew better now.	Sed melius nunc sciebat.
.	.
But probably not as you think.	Sed verisimile non est ut tibi videtur.
No one did anything.	Nemo aliquid fecit.
I couldn't think of anything else to do.	Non potuit cogitare quid faciendum.
So much so.	Tantum sic est.
I know everything too well	Scio omnia nimium bene
I never wanted to stay up late	Numquam voluit manere ut nuper
I hope you will never see him any more.	Spero numquam eum plus videre.
I actually go along with him	Ego vere ire per cum eo
I thought I would be there.	Putabam me non fore.
To feel fun	Ut sentio amet
Not as it is, or will be, but it is.	Non ut est, vel erit, sed est.
Today	Hodie.
I don't think you'd understand him	Non puto se intelligere velis
You think you could do something.	Putasne te aliquid facere posse.
I could not do this again	Non potui hoc fieri, non iterum
I am stronger than this	Ego plus quam hoc
The thing is pretty good.	Res satis bene.
I know that too.	Scio etiam.
I didn't want to speak or hear or think	Nolui loqui vel audire vel cogitare
You'd like it too.	Id etiam velis.
Not just at work.	Non solum ad opus.
Maybe someone wants.	Aliquam quis velit.
I could not live	Ego non potui vivere
There are things.	Sunt res.
one thing will be enough.	unum satis erit.
Maybe it's you.	Forsitan est tibi.
But who is more than himself.	Sed quis quam ipsum.
He wanted to stay home now.	Domum suam nunc manere voluit.
I'm also on purpose	Ego quoque ad rem
But that was the time.	Sed id tempus erat.
He also knew what would happen	Etiam sciebat quid esset futurum
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
Now, you know, I don't know enough	Modo, scis, non satis scio
But there is only one.	Sed quis nisi est.
I just need to do this	Ego iustus opus ad hoc
Even more than now.	Etiam quam nunc.
I don't have a better	Non habere melius
I couldn't believe me	Non potui credere me
Now he or she wants him.	Nunc vel ipsum velit.
I know it is difficult	Scio esse difficile
But nothing.	Sed nihil.
He can give it to you.	Ille tibi dare potest.
I didn't know his name	Ego nesciebam nomen suum
Certainly there was nothing.	Certe nihil erat.
I really wanted him.	Ego vere vellem illum.
I thought of him but not	Cogitavi eo sed non
I think they are busy with something	Puto quod sunt occupatus ad aliquid
As always well	Ut semper bene
As much as I can say	Quantum possum dicere
I must have.	necesse habeo.
Well, rightly so.	Bene, recte.
I know what you mean	Scio quid velit
I knew he wanted	Sciebam se velle

I also am a man like you	Ego quoque homo sum sicut tu

I think the same thing.	Idem puto.
This is good and bad.	Hoc bonum et malum est.
I didn't know at the time	Nesciebam quo tempore
and time is.	et tempus est.
There is always something else to want.	Semper est aliud velle.
I do that now	Facio quod nunc
We don't have one.	Non habemus unum.
I know what you said is true	Scio quid dixisti verum
I feel, I feel, and I feel.	Sentio, sentio, et sentio.
I haven't seen anything else	Non videtur aliud
I certainly feel this way.	Ego certe sic sentio.
He could not stop himself.	Se ipsum prohibere non potuit.
I'm lucky enough to have friends	Sum felix satis habere amicos
I was still there with him.	cum eo adhuc eram ibi.
It was a very busy day.	Non erat valde occupatus dies.
i hope i love it	Spero te amo eam
Got to think.	Obtinuit cogitare.
I thought about you a lot	Cogitavi de vobis multum
You're right there.	Ibi tu recte.
I want you to know that	Volo te scire quod
To the future.	Ad futurum.
Who I could see	Quis non potui videre
He could not speak.	Posset dicere.
I knew he was saying something.	Sciebam se aliquid dicere.
I can't go now	Non possum ire nunc
This he did.	Hoc fecit.
Say what you want.	Dic quid vis.
I wish she was here too	Volo etiam hic fuit
I couldn't do that	Non potui quod est
Even or how it was.	Etiam vel quam erat.
I hope to see you soon.	Spero videre te mox.
This does not come	Hoc non venit
Well, not well.	Bene, non bene.
World of Warcraft	Etiam tempus enim id.
I need someone to go with me.	Mihi opus est aliquem ire mecum.
But he would not.	Noluit autem.
May the force be with you.	Sit vis tecum.
I could not speak the truth	Non potui dicere verum
He is not who we are.	Non est is qui sumus.
But he could not do it himself.	Sed facere se non potuit.
One person at a time.	Homo unus ad tempus.
I'm happy at home	Sum felix domi

I wanted you to love me	Volui te amo me
She only said the truth.	Illa solum verum dixit.
I am the only one you can believe	Ego sum solus unus potes credere
May I be there for you	Utinam me ibi te
I know what it is	Scio quid sit
I can't get a chance	Non possum accipere forte
That's the whole thing.	Id totum est.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
Now it is said.	Nunc dictum est.
I don't have time to find out.	Non tempus invenire.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
You can hear everything in the house.	Omnia per domum potes audire.
For never.	Numquam enim.
I just do my job	Ego iustus facio meum officium
I want people to know, really.	Volo homines scire, vere.
But from what has been said only.	Sed a dictum nisi.
And no one hastily succeeded him.	Et nemo cito pro illo.
I am all for him	Ego omnia pro eo
All right about everything.	Recte de omnibus.
I just need the money	Ego iustus opus pecuniam
I knew what she meant	Sciebam quid sibi vellet
I knew more than	Sciebam plus quam
I'll tell you what that meant.	Dicam quid id esset.
I will speak the truth here	Verum hic dicam
and the dog.	et canis.
There is none.	Nulla est.
I don't think why at all	Non puto cur omnino
I want you to accept this.	Volo te hoc accipere.
I have one question	Habeo unum quaestionem
And you want to stay, you want.	Et vis manere, vis.
The boy was here.	Puer hic erat.
I really like the film	Ego vere amo in eo quod amet
But we don't have time.	Sed non tempus habemus.
You need to know him.	Eum scire debes.
No no no how.	Nulla non nulla quam.
I know what you will do	Scio quid sit facturus
Yes, it was from someone.	Etiam a aliquam erat.
I really love you	Ego vere amo
I thought about everything	Cogitavi de omnibus
He thought that was what he thought.	Putabat quod erat quod putabat.
I feel nothing will happen tonight, but soon	Nihil hac nocte futurum sentio, sed cito
I guess that's what we do.	Suspicor id quod nos.
not for anyone else	Non enim quis aliud
He left me nothing.	nihil mihi reliquit.
No one wants to go there anymore.	Nemo iam illuc ire vult.
He could not, nor could he.	Non potuit nec potuit.
I even met something	Ego quidem occurrit aliquid
I really wanted it	Ego vere voluit eam
This has already been done.	Hoc iam factum est.
I am not just.	Non sum iustus.
I don't want to believe	Nolo credere
That can never be done.	Quod fieri numquam potest.
She did nothing wrong.	Nihil mali fecit illa.
It is not easy.	Non facile.
Maybe he had.	Forte habuit.
Maybe too much.	Forte, nimium.
This is the man.	Hic est, homo.
I tried but couldn't	Conatus sum sed non potuit
You can talk to everyone.	Loqui ad omnes potes.
I will work well	Ego quoque opus erit
Yes, it was not.	Etiam non erat.
I don't even have time to think	Non quidem tempus cogitare
I knew nothing else.	nihil aliud sciebam.
I always knew when you were	Semper scivi cum tu
never get sick.	numquam male.
didn't know enough	hoc nesciebam, satis
but it was too late.	Sero autem erat.
I just want to feel it	EGO iustus volo sentio
It was just as fast as he could.	Erat nunc quantum potuit.
That was how it was.	Ut id erat erat.
You'd be right.	Recte tu velis.
I know you can and will if you need	scio te posse et velle si debes
Look how good you are.	Vide quam tu sis bonus.
I'm not sure	Ego certe non sunt
Which is true.	Quod verum est.
I never thought of him.	Numquam ego eum.
I really understood it too	Ego vere intellexit illud quoque
If anyone can help it that's fine.	Si quis adiuvet ut bene sit.
This boy is good.	Hic puer bonus est.
I thought everything was done right	Omnia recte fieri putavi
I'm going to work tomorrow	Ego ad opus cras
She got herself where she wanted to be.	Illa se obtinuit ubi vellet.
Even if one chooses not to save.	Etiam quis velit non nisi.
This just happened next week.	Hoc modo factum est proxima septimana.
I doubt you do	Dubito te facere
He went and went.	Abiit et abiit.
And well.	Et bene.
It's almost ready.	Fere paratus est.
And what you know is one.	Et quid scis, unus est.
I truly love you	Ego vere amo te
I did not know what it was from us	nesciebam quid esset a nobis
I do not have.	Non habeo.
We are one through and through.	Per unum sumus et per.
But no one wants that.	Nulla sed velit quam.
I'm not much behind him	Ego non multo post eum
One more time please.	Unum tempus, velit.
I am really alone now	Ego vere solus nunc
I just want to help.	EGO iustus volo adiuvare.
I never wanted to be with him.	numquam cum eo esse volui.
That's probably what he thought.	Probabiliter id putavit.
I told him what happened	Dixi ei quod factum est
It should be early.	Mane debet esse.
I really wanted to be	Ego vere voluit esse
And I looked after him	Et vidi post eum
I love him and he loves me	Ego eum amo, et me amat
I knew coming	Sciebam venire
I first met him this morning	Hoc primum occurrit ei mane
Nothing else but really.	Nihil aliud quam vere.
I thought what I looked like	Cogitavi quod vidi sicut
it is.	est.
a just man	vir iustus iustus
Work	Opus.
But he was from whom.	Sed a erat quam.
I don't want anyone else	Nolo quis aliud
I like traveling.	Placet iter fecit.
He could not leave her.	Non potuit eam relinquere.
I don't want to be one with you	Nolo unum esse te
I just need to know that's all	Ego iustus opus est scire quod omnia
I knew he wanted	Sciebam se velle
He even wants it now.	Etiam id nunc velit.
What is your occupation.	Quod est opus tuum.
I knew, I knew I was with him	sciebam, scivi me cum illo
I didn't say anything else to him.	Non dixi ei aliud.
I feel like he doesn't want me	Sentio ut ille me non vis
I don't have to think about it	Non est cogitare de illo
I don't know who did it.	Nescio quis fecerit.
I was not yet ready to see	Nondum videre paratus eram
I have seen it.	Vidi eam.
There is no one thing	Non est unum quicquam
I will do it tonight	Ego hac nocte facere
I want to see who he is	Volo videre quis est
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
And it was enough.	Et satis erat.
I saw her teacher alone	Vidi magister eam unum
I didn't know him	Et ego nesciebam eum
I heard you	Audivi te
I didn't think it would be	Non putavi fore
No one knows.	Nemo scit.
You are me.	Tu mihi es.
I couldn't do that	Non potui quod est
Yes this has been said before.	Etiam id dictum ante.
We must do this.	Hoc nobis faciendum est.
I don't think you could do it.	Non puto te id facere posse.
I thought it was okay now	Putavi nunc bene esse
I don't know what now	Nescio quid nunc
Now I feel more than ever.	Nunc quam semper sentio.
I know how much she loves you	Scio quantum amat te
We can talk all morning.	Mane loqui possumus omnia.
I thought about doing something about this	De hoc aliquid faciendum mihi putavit
Or you may know where he is going, but not where he is.	Vel scire potes quo eat, sed non ubi sit.
I wish I could not	Utinam non
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
Today was a pretty good day.	Hodie satis bonus dies fuit.
This is not likely.	Verisimile hoc non est.
I hope it is.	Spero, is est.
i want it very much.	valde volo.
He did very well.	Optime fecit.
I just can't do this again	Ego iustus potest hoc facere iterum
Do this, do not do it.	Hoc fac, ne feceris.
I need advice.	consilium mihi opus est.
I don't know you other than your name	Ego te non novi aliud quam nomen tuum
But he wants some.	Sed aliquam velit.
This is only with you.	Hoc tantum est apud te.
That is, they ought not to do so.	Id est, rem non debere.
I really do something else.	Aliquid aliud faciam vere.
I would like to do both.	Utrumque vellem.
Please don't buy again.	Adhuc placet, non emere.
He cannot speak.	Loqui non potest.
I never want to do it again	Numquam vis ut faciam illud iterum
Really not very good.	Vere non est valde bonum.
I just saw it.	Modo vidi eam.
And perhaps	Et fortasse.
He always wants more.	Plus semper velit.
And better there than here with us.	Et melius ibi, quam hic nobiscum.
I was there for her	Ibi enim essem eius
Much, much better.	Multo, multo melius.
Nothing to him.	Eo nihil ei.
I know what you want to hear	Scio quid velit audire
I already told you	Iam dixi vobis
I really don't think much about it anymore	Ego vere non multum cogitare de posse
That was not necessary.	Quod non erat necesse.
Always got someone to do for me	Semper obtinuit aliquem ut faciam mihi
Why did he come? 	Cur venit?
I don't even know that this was his job.	Ne hoc quidem scio officium eius fuisse.
He likes him.	Velit eum.
I don't know where you sit	Nescio quo sit
For he was.	Is enim erat.
yes i'm here.	etiam hic sum.
You can't do it for me.	Non potes me facere.
I have many things to do for you	Multa habeo vobis facere
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum est.
This is also my name.	Hoc quoque nomen meum est.
It is well, indeed.	Bene est, vere.
I feel good about this.	Bene de hoc sentio.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
I certainly don't think you're different from me.	Ego certe non puto te aliud a me.
So it shouldn't be too hard.	Ita non debet esse difficile.
I have not forgotten it.	Non oblitus est.
I'm sure it will be hard to find	Ego certe non erit difficile invenire
I really like that person	Ego vere similis ut homo
I need you.	Opus est tibi.
I am alone but that's good	Ego solus sed quod bonum
I'm gonna be there now.	Ut sit amet nulla nunc.
not hard enough.	Non satis difficile.
I just can't stop	Ego iustus non prohibere
They are very good.	Valde bona sunt.
I can't do good here	Non possum hic facere bonum
I'll do it for sure.	Faciam certe.
I need some help getting the day	Opus est aliquo auxilio questus diem
I can't believe you even think	Non possum credere te etiam cogitare
Or you.	Vel tibi.
That's what you need to know.	Id scire debes.
But it is not the same.	Sed non ipsum est.
To be with me.	Mecum esse.
It's time to get some one out.	Aliquam quis aliquam ex.
Don't act on it.	Non agere.
I know for sure.	Pro certo scio.
I've never heard this before.	Nunquam ante hoc audivi.
I did it before	Ante feci
And my boy too.	Et puer quoque meus.
But there was none at all.	Sed non erat nulla.
I need my love	Mihi opus est mea
I have always wanted this, but never have it.	Hoc semper volui, sed nunquam habeo.
His father	Pater suus.
I want him to be like a good man	Volo eum esse sicut homo bonus
I think I could say nothing	Puto nihil dicere potui
I am here and with you	Ego hic et tecum
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
He was not.	Non erat.
I will tell the truth today	Dicam hoc verum hodie
I can't see what you like	Non possum videre quod tibi placet
This looks really bad.	Hoc vere malum spectat.
The plan was there, though.	Fuisse ibi consilium, sed.
I absolutely doubt	Ego omnino dubito
I have seen it before	Vidi ante
They're great.	Sunt magna.
I thought a lot about it	Cogitavi multum de illo
I want to tell everything.	Omnia narrare volo.
Not too early.	Non nimis mane.
I could not see what it was	Non potui videre quid esset, sed
I need to know me	Scire mihi opus est mihi
Yes, but it is the same.	Etiam sed ipsum est.
I thought I was just talking.	Putavi tantum loqui.
But neither was there.	Sed nec erat est.
Thus he is a man.	Sic est homo.
Now I can't hear.	Iam audire non possum.
I didn't do it at all.	Omnino non feci.
This can be done quickly.	Quod quidem fieri potest cito.
I can stay as late	Ego potest manere quod nuper
That boy loves you so much	Ille puer tantum amat
Now see what's happened.	Nunc vide quid acciderit.
I am one day late.	Ego sum dies unus, sero.
He brings us out.	Ipse nos e.
but you know me.	sed scis me.
I think about that all night	Puto quod omnia nocte
But not only.	Sed non nisi.
It was done.	Factum.
Maybe it was not great.	Aliquam non erat magna.
I need him as much as I need	Mihi opus est ei quantum mihi opus est
It's big enough.	Satis magna est.
It's not what you want to do.	Non est quod velis facere.
So it's great.	Sic magna est.
But that's how it is.	Sed id ipsum quam.
It's you.	Est tibi.
I can do better than you.	Melius possum facere quam tu.
But this will be time.	Hoc autem erit tempus.
He was not here.	Non erat hic.
I wanted to see my dad	Pater meus volui videre
I knew you were going to do it.	Sciebam te facturum esse.
I don't think he did it.	Non videtur id fecisse.
I want to see it	Volo te videre eam
I tried but I could not	Conatus sum sed non potui
I have nothing fun to do either.	Habeo nihil amet facere vel.
I did it years ago	Ego feci eam annos
This also seemed too good to be true.	Hoc etiam bonum videbatur esse verum.
I told you it would be easy	Dixi vobis facile esset
Now that's the same thing.	Nunc id ipsum est.
I have a long time	Habeo diu
Maybe someone did.	Forsitan aliquis fecerit.
That's the only way he does.	Id solum modo agit.
I could not do it	Non potui facere
When this was done.	Quod cum factum esset.
I just love her.	Ego iustus amo eam.
I thought of my time until now.	Cogitavi tempus meum usque ad tempus.
I want to stop	Volo ut prohibere
I don't want to go anywhere	Non vis ire huc
I know what to do	Scio quid hoc facere
I could not live without him	Non potui sine eo
It was a bad thing.	Malum erat.
I can't do it for you.	Non possum tibi facere.
Well kind.	Bene genus.
And my love too.	Et mea quoque.
Not both at the same time.	Non ambo simul.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
I just want to do better for everyone.	EGO iustus volo facere melius pro omnibus.
This is not for me.	Hoc non est mihi.
Nothing is better.	Nihil melius.
Same thing at home.	Idem domi.
This is what the father can do.	Hoc est quod pater facere potest.
I don't think much about it	Non videtur quod multa de illo
You don't talk.	Et non loqui.
I know this has been difficult	Scio hoc difficile fuit
I just don't believe that	Non solum non credere quod
This is hard work.	Hoc est difficile opus.
But as it is now.	Sed ut nunc est.
I can't always be here	Non possum hic semper
And you can't see.	Et non potes videre.
He himself came.	Ipse venit.
That's the best way to do it.	Id optime facere.
I don't want to hurt	Non vis ut malum
I think a lot of people would be.	Multum homines puto fore.
I'm there again.	Ibi iterum sum.
I could not do this anymore	Non potui hoc amplius
I don't do anything wrong	Non facere quicquam mali
I just want to leave it.	Ego iustus volo eam relinquere.
I don't feel anything	Non sentio aliquid
I wonder if you are behind this	Miror si post hoc es
I was the name.	nomen fui.
I just want to see	Ego iustus volo video vidi
I'm ready to get you there	Ego paratus sum ad te ibi

As you like.	Ut tibi placet.
I didn't want to tell her that	Nolui dicere ei quod

But that is none.	Sed id nulla est.

We all get the same thing.	Omnes ut idem.
I didn't want to believe any of it	Nolui credere aliquem ex eo
Maybe you're sorry.	Fortasse paenitet.
This is not bad.	Hoc non est malum.

I know nothing other than you.	Ego nihil novi quam tu.
I don't think it would be	Non puto fore
I thought perhaps .	Cogitavi fortasse .
I told you already	Dixi vobis iam
I feel something this time	Sentio quid hoc tempore
In not wanting.	In non velit.
I just don't get this	Ego iustus non accipere hoc
Stay with me.	Mane mecum.
Nothing is better.	Nihil melius est.
I really love you de	Ego vere amo te de
I could totally understand how and why	Prorsus intelligere potui quomodo et quare
I don't want to stay here anymore	Nolo hic manere amplius
I knew him	Sciebam eo
we are here.	nos hic esse.
Better than nothing.	Melius quam nihil est.
I couldn't believe things about you	Non potui credere sunt de te
Now all I need to do is	Nunc opus est facere
I need to know a little something	Mihi opus est scire parum aliquid
But that's never enough.	Sed id numquam satis.
Get me something about it	Ut mihi aliquid de illo
No that's time now.	Nulla id tempus nunc.
I don't want to think about it	Non vis cogitare de illo
I never tried to see her again.	Numquam iterum eam videre conatus est.
Do me as you do.	Fac me sicut tu facis.
I have often thought this to be	Saepe putavi hoc esse
It was not enough.	Parum fuit.
nor was he a father any more.	nec erat pater amplius.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
I told him it was okay	Dixi ei bene esset
He knows nothing.	Nihil scit.
can he know anything?	numquid scire potest aliquid?
Me for him.	Me pro eo.
I have one for me	Habeo unum me
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
One question.	Una quaestio.
Not from him yet.	Non a ipsum tamen.
Yes they are.	Ita sunt.
I will do it for sure	Ego certe faciam illud
To this day no one knows what has happened.	Ad hanc diem nemo scit quid acciderit.
But that was enough.	Sed satis id fuit.
It's all for me.	Mihi totum est.
You are not right.	Non recte.
Looks like it was going to happen.	Similis erat futurum.
You'd been there.	Fuisse ibi velis.
And why? 	Et quare?
I know her name, she thought.	Scio nomen, putavit.
I want to go tomorrow.	Cras ire volo.
What he could do.	Quod facere potuit.
The teacher there loves me.	Ibi magister me amat.
You need to tell me more.	Plus mihi debes dicere.
It was time to come now.	Tempus erat iam futurum.
He has not yet come home.	Nondum domum venit.
I'm here to help.	Sum hic ad auxilium.
I like you over there!.	Ego amo te ibi !.
There's still time.	Non est adhuc tempus.
But there was none in it.	Sed in erat nulla.
I have seen everything.	Vidi omnia.
Maybe it was his way.	Fortasse suo modo fuit.
Perhaps it is so.	Forsitan ita sit.
It was certain if anyone could.	Certum erat si quis posset.
And certainly enough.	Et certe satis.
He said to him what he wanted to hear.	Dixit ei quid audire vellet.
It will always be so.	Sic semper erit.
You already have nothing.	Iam nihil habes.
No one ever understood better than himself.	Nemo umquam melius quam ipse intellexit.
I got no advice.	Et consilium non obtinuit.
I didn't want to be there.	Nolui ibi esse.
Not even that.	Ne eam quidem.
If you think this is yours, it is likely.	Si hoc tuum esse putas, verisimile est.
He knows that he is not.	Scit se non esse.
There's more there.	Ibi plus ibi.
It's enough for me.	Satis mihi est.
both good and evil.	et bonum et aliquid malum.
They are too early.	Nimis mane sunt.
But it is an evil.	Malum tamen tamen est.
I never believe in him.	Numquam in eum.
He did not think so.	Non putavit.
It was lunch.	Prandium erat.
Someone who is not me.	Aliquis qui non est me.
This is not true.	Hoc non habet verum.
I have tried.	Conatus sum.
By not thinking.	Per non putabat.
This is what he could do.	Hoc est quod facere potuit.
and are getting on.	et sunt questus a.
This is your.	Tuum est.
I believe him when he says this.	Credo ei cum hoc dicit.
But there was only one.	Sed non erat nisi.
But he knew that he was there.	Sed sciebat ibi esse.
I never even like to go.	Numquam etiam placet ire.
He wanted to see what the boy was going to do.	Videre voluit quid puer facturus esset.
But not this same thing.	Sed non hoc ipsum.
That's when he would do it.	Id cum facturum esse.
Maybe he buys it.	Fortasse emit.
That was one thing for sure.	Id unum certum erat.
But no one before.	Sed id nulla ante.
If not for you, that's fine.	Si non sunt tibi, Bene.
Only man.	Solus homo.
It was good.	Bonum fuit.
i think i know.	scire puto.
I never have time to do it.	Numquam tempus id facere.
I don't want to chat with anyone.	Nolo loqui cum aliquo.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
I doubt very much.	Valde dubito.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I want something to do.	Volo aliquid facere.
But there was none.	Sed nulla erat.
He could not come hither.	Huc venire posset.
I see you after my years	Ego te post me annos
and somehow he is talking to me.	et nescio quo modo mecum loquitur.
I think it is something	Puto esse aliquid
It is good and evil.	Bonum est et malum.
I feel like I'm but there you are.	Sentio ut me, sed ibi es.
I don't mean anything more than	Ego non sit aliquid plus quam
Yes it is good.	Ita est bonum.
I could not help her.	Non potui eam adiuvare.
Yes, that was it.	Etiam id erat erat.
He wanted me.	Voluit me.
It will be in due time.	Erit in tempore.
I really didn't know what to do	Ego vere nesciebam quid facere
But it is not so.	Sed non ita est.
I couldn't believe nobody	Non potui credere nemo
Now I have to live with him	Nunc habeo vivere cum eo
I saw what happened	Vidi quod factum est
So he has this himself.	Ita habet hoc ipse.
She hasn't told me much yet.	Multum adhuc mihi non indicavit.
There was no time to think what it was.	Tempus non erat cogitare quid esset.
I just can't hear you now	Modo possum te audire nunc
I think that's certain	Puto quod certum
I thought of you	Cogitavi te
I told you everything.	Dixi vobis omnia.
I just had a really good time	Ego iustus erat vere bonum tempus
I will tell you everything	Dicam tibi omnia
There was none.	Non fuit.
I did not think through this.	Ego per hoc non putavi.
None of the above.	Nulla in dictum est.
There appears to be a man.	Ibi vir esse videtur.
Too bad still.	Nimis adhuc.
Which is not seen.	Quod non videtur.
I am sure	Certus sum
Look at her.	Vide ad eam.
But not always before.	Sed non semper ante.
Or at least it's in me.	Vel certe est in me.
He buys it.	Emit eam.
I need to get myself together	Mihi opus est ut ipse simul
We need it this year.	Hoc anno nobis opus est.
Not so much, but enough.	Non tantum, sed satis.
You have nothing to say.	Nihil dicere non habes.
I have done everything on my own	Omnia feci etiam in mea
This is not to do.	Hoc non facere.
I forgot this year.	Oblitus sum quo anno.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
And I told him what happened	Et dixi ei quod factum est
I just don't like man	Non solum non sicut homo
That's the whole class.	Totum illud genus est.
I'm not thinking right now.	Ego nunc non cogitas.
Well indeed it is not.	Bene quidem non est.
Not for you.	Non tibi.
No one should stop us.	Nemo nos prohibere debet.
It was great to see.	Magna erat videre.
.	.
How can this be done?	Quomodo hoc fieri potest.
I never got to say.	Numquam obtinuit dicere.
Well, maybe you can.	Bene, fortasse potes.
There is more to one than nothing.	Plus est unum quam nihil.
My father is gone.	Pater meus abiit.
But neither would my father hear this.	Sed nec pater meus hoc audire voluit.
I never do it on time.	Numquam id faciam in tempore.
That's what I wanted to do.	Id facere vellem.
See him soon.	Vide mox ipsum.
It was not so hard.	Non tam difficile erat.
I would do so.	Facerem.
You don't need to be here.	Non debes hic esse.
But above all he was a good man.	Sed ante omnia vir bonus erat.
Similar.	Similis.
Certainly we are not.	Certe non sumus.
This thing can be done by me.	Hoc per me aliquid fieri potest.
Wishing you better.	Melius est tibi velle.
To know well.	Scire bene.
Now when can we do it?.	Nunc quando id possumus agere ?.
No it's not that.	Nulla non est quam.
So it is.	Ita est.
Even more than that.	Etiam sit amet quam quam.
This is a real work.	Hoc est verum opus.
It's time but always.	Aliquam sed semper est.
But you'd like to stop me.	Sed prohibere me velis.
I love you.	Te amo.
It is very likely.	Verisimile est.
Do you think he's a.	Putas' a.
I am a man.	Homo sum.
He likes to do it.	Velit facere.
He was here.	Hic erat.
Not you, but the question.	Non tu, sed quaestio.
Even he never saw him.	Etiam numquam ipsum vidit.
I am indebted to you.	Debeo.
He is busy doing something.	Faciendum quod ipse occupatus.
It's something else.	Est aliquid aliud.
No not very important.	Nulla non ipsum magna.
I can do it.	Possum id facere.
and got it.	et obtinuit eam.
Even what was said.	Etiam quis dictum erat.
I am totally certain.	Prorsus certum habeo.
It seemed like doing.	Simile facere videbatur.
He looked like he always had.	Vidit sicut semper habuit.
And this is true.	Et hoc est verum.
That's good to know.	Quod bonum est scire.
I knew what it was like.	Scivi quid simile.
I was like, this is not working.	Similis fui, hoc non est opus.
He was not prepared enough.	Non erat satis paratus.
We can do better.	Melius facere possumus.
Can't leave it.	Non potest eam relinquere.
That was it.	Id erat.
You never get married.	Numquam tu uxorem.
That made me pretty happy.	Quod me fecit satis felix.
I need to go.	Ire opus est.
Certainly not alone.	Certe non solus.
You can't do this yourself.	Non potes hoc facere tibi.
I know what you did to me.	Scio quid mihi feceris.
I think there is something wrong with him.	Puto esse aliquid mali apud eum.
I love her.	Ego eam amo.
I like it better this way.	Placet melius hoc modo.
Maybe he's here.	Fortasse hic est.
The next night.	Proxima nocte.
To be very happy.	Ut sit amet ipsum.
OK to do something.	Bene esse aliquid.
I don't like business.	Non ut rem.
They are fine.	Bene sunt.
That was in the afternoon.	Id esse ad meridiem.
You said so well.	Ita bene dixisti.
Here a little while ago.	Hic paulo ante.
That's it before.	Ut id ante ante.
To do this.	Id facere.
You're not good enough.	Non satis es.
But as it seems.	Sed ut videtur.
Not the first time indeed.	Non primum quidem.
There's really nothing like it.	Vere nihil est aliud simile.
She thought better of it.	Melius eam putavit.
Both are good.	Utrumque bonum est.
He was still very sorry.	Erat adhuc valde.
I can't stop you.	Non possum te prohibere.
But not even this seems to be necessary.	Sed ne hoc quidem opus esse videtur.
But yet it was great.	Sed sed erat magna.
I have help at home.	Habeo auxilium domi.
And he was here.	Erat autem hic.
It is the same.	Idem est.
Not good or bad.	Non bene vel male.
I've never seen him like this.	Nunquam sic eum vidi.
It can't be.	Non potest esse.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
Well done.	Bene fecit.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
This is what I feel, but it is not certain.	Hoc est quod sentio, sed certum non est.
This is very well true.	Hoc optime verum est.
My dad has tried to make me better.	Pater meus melius me facere conatus est.
And he said to him: Morning to good.	Et dixit ei: Mane ad bonum.
But there are a lot of people there.	Sed multum homines sunt ibi.
It was pretty much.	Erat satis multum.
He wants better.	Melius qui velit.
Not so much anymore.	Non ita amplius.
Certainly he had, but he was no longer so sure.	Certe habuit, sed iam non ita certus erat.
What are you.	Quae tu.
He still did not know what this meant.	Quid hoc esset, adhuc nesciebat.
You and you are the same.	Idem tu et te.
Yours and mine.	Tua et mea.
He knows how to act.	Scit agere.
I will say this.	Hoc dicam.
In order to be yourself.	In ut ipsum enim.
He did this job even better.	Hoc officium melius etiam fecit.
He is mine who does not want to go into the future.	Meus est qui in futurum ire non vult.
But there is more to be done.	Sed plus est faciendum.
Boy am I to do this.	Puer sum hoc facere.
I like it more, more.	Plus placet, plus.
I am certain.	Certum habeo.
I'm looking very good.	Im valde bonus vultus.
All things to him.	Omnia ad eum.
But don't do it.	Sed ne feceris.
He alone acts just.	Solus ille iustus agit.
Nothing can stop him.	Nihil potest eum prohibere.
No one said to me.	Nemo mihi dixit.
not by someone.	Non ab aliquo.
In.	In.
There's nothing like that.	Nihil simile.
You don't have to do this.	Hoc facere non habes.
Yes that's how.	Etiam id quam.
He has done me wrong.	Male me fecit.
Now I know this.	Nunc id scio.
This boy.	Hic puer.
Don't think about it.	Noli cogitare.
That's something to say.	Quod aliquid dicere.
It has nothing to do with me.	Nihil ad me habet.
No one has seen anything.	Nemo aliquid vidit.
Perhaps he and she	Forsitan ipse et illa .
I don't know what's happened to him.	Quid ei acciderit nescio.
I have a good time with this.	Non habeo tempus bonum hoc.
He did not even know.	Nec novit quidem.
It was pretty good now.	Satis nunc bene erat.
It is definitely possible.	Certum est posse.
Nothing has been said of him.	Nihil de illo dictum est.
yes i love you.	Etiam te amo.
But not all of him.	Sed non omnes eius.
That which was not done.	Quod factum non est.
It is one thing.	Aliud est.
He wanted me to know.	Scire me voluit.
Maybe but it was great.	Aliquam sed erat magna.
I can see to do this.	Hoc facere possum videre.
But I don't know how to do it.	Sed nescio quomodo, non agere.
We have one when we need it.	Unum habemus cum opus est.
Not for me.	Non mihi.
Maybe not ever.	Fortasse non umquam.
i'm very pleased about that right now.	Sum admodum ut nunc.
But this is so, certainly it cannot be.	Sed hoc ita est, certe esse non potest.
He said too much.	Nimium dixit.
It is never enough.	Numquam satis.
They are together now.	Simul nunc sunt.
He could not speak any more.	Non potuit amplius dicere.
Yes, you really can.	Etiam, vere potes.
He does not know us.	Nescit nos.
you need to meet.	occurrit tibi necesse est.
The matter was.	Res erat.
I know you have to believe in yourself.	Scio te habere in te.
This is not good.	Non est bonum hoc.
Take it easy.	Accipere facile.
But he could not do it by himself.	Ipse autem per se ipsum facere non posset.
.	.
Even get yourself through.	Etiam ut ipsum per.
I can't think of any better.	Quis hoc bonum esset cogitare non possum.
Or perhaps.	Vel fortasse.
Maybe they are not.	Fortasse non sunt.
To be id.	Esse id.
It's great.	Est magna.
It is important to him.	Aliquam sit amet ipsum ad.
I have a lot to do before noon.	Multum habeo facere ante meridiem.
Make yourself.	Fac te ipsum.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
If it pleases you in that way.	Si placet, eo modo.
To, please.	Ad, velit.
Don't even ask tonight.	Ne hac nocte quidem quaesivit.
He does nothing.	Nihil facit.
I don't see this.	Hoc ego non video.
He does not come after her.	Non venit post eam.
He doesn't know what happened.	Nescit quid acciderit.
That's what.	Id quod.
through this he got it.	per hoc obtinuit.
But he is not here.	Sed non hic est.
But nothing is the same.	Sed nihil ipsum.
I was doing really good.	Ego vere bonum facerem.
You do what he does, you certainly do.	Facis, quod facit, certe facis.
He also wants it.	Etiam id velit.
These are really great.	Haec vere magna sunt.
Only one person could ever do this.	Solus homo unus umquam hoc facere potuit.
I was the only person in the room.	Solus homo in cubiculum fui.
Something was always going to happen.	Semper aliquid futurum erat.
He would not.	Noluit.
She didn't want to do that.	Quod facere illa noluit.
But just not enough.	Sed tantum non satis est.
You know who you are and what you are.	Scis qui sis, et quid sis.
I am his post office.	Post officium suum sum.
I just didn't know any better.	Modo nihil melius nesciebam.
Thus he could not go, he could not truly.	Sic ire non potuit, vere non potuit.
I tried to think of something else.	Conatus est aliquid aliud cogitare.
Nothing bad has been done.	Nihil mali factum est.
It is a great question.	Magna quaestio est.
Can't stop.	Non potest prohibere.
That was it.	Erat id.
It's early enough.	Satis mane est.
Too hard to find.	Nimis difficile est invenire.
I didn't want it before.	Non ante velit.
She thought well enough.	Satis bene putavit.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
He could not think.	Non potuit cogitare.
First thing please.	Primum quod placet.
Which one	Quam quis.
I feel it often.	Sentio saepe faciam.
She said nothing.	Nihil illa dixit.
He did this easily.	Facile id fecit.
You'd like to be with me too.	Ad me quoque velis esse.
I often wonder.	Saepe miror.
Well, here it is.	Bene, hic est.
It is not.	Non est.
I do not know.	Non scio.
I don't want you to know.	Nolo te scire.
I don't see.	Ego non video.
Hardly anyone's yet.	Vix quis in adhuc.
Get more if you can.	Plus si potes.
I could not stop talking about you.	Non potui de te prohibere.
He comes to me.	Venit ad me.
I knew this would happen.	Sciebam fore.
Well, it's something else.	Bene, aliquid aliud est.
He likes to play with people.	Vult ludere homines.
I can do nothing at all.	Omnino nihil possum facere.
It will certainly be probable.	Probabile certe erit.
I like both.	Utrumque mihi placet.
I want nothing to say to him.	Nihil volo ei dicere.
I'm surprised you are tonight.	Miror te hac nocte esse.
I just want you to know.	Ego iustus volo te scire.
Look at this.	Hoc vide.
There is no one behind me.	Nemo est post me.
to who.	ut qui.
He wanted this badly.	Hoc male voluit.
it is enough for us all.	nobis omnibus satis est.
I've got a little better.	Ego paulo melius obtinuit.
He refused to see.	Noluit videre.
Me and him are men together.	Me et illum simul homines sumus.
I thought of the whole thing.	Cogitavi totum.
He could do nothing about this now.	Nihil de hoc nunc facere potuit.
This is not true.	Hoc non est verum.
I know you did.	Scio te fecisse.
Maybe it shouldn't ever happen after that.	Forsitan ne umquam post id factum sit.
No more than that.	Nulla quam quam.
You have one thing that is yours.	Unum illud habes quod tuum est.
This was his true self.	Hoc erat verum suum esse.
But this is not enough.	Sed hoc parum est.
I have three.	tres habeo.
It probably was.	Probabile fuit.
He does well.	Bene facit.
I don't have a house.	Non habeo domum.
I have done it for you.	pro nobis feci vobis.
It is good if you do it.	Bonum est, si feceris.
Tell me where you are going and when you are.	Dic mihi quo sis facturus et quando sis.
To those who love him and never.	Ut qui amet ipsum et numquam.
I can't see.	Videre non possum.
I think that's it for us.	Id nobis puto.
Or hitherto hither.	Vel huc usque huc.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
I know him long enough.	Satis diu eum novi.
I was told.	Dictum est mihi.
The father gave it to me.	Pater id mihi dedit.
He has not.	Non habet.
But it was not so.	Sed non erat ut.
I have done it.	id feci.
You can find what I am now here.	Hic invenire potes, quid mihi nunc.
Not even that.	Ne id quidem.
I don't know indeed.	Nescio quidem.
But one thing does another.	Sed unum aliud facit.
Well, never fear.	Bene, numquam vereor.
He would not do this.	Non hoc voluit.
He saw her through him.	Per se vidit eam.
You can't do this to me.	Hoc mihi facere non potes.
It was in a big way.	In in magna erat.
Better now, really.	Melius nunc, vere.
Yes, that was what he wanted.	Etiam id erat ut voluit.
It was mine.	Mea fuit.
It looks bad to me.	Male mihi videtur.
And my father knew it.	Sciebat autem pater meus.
We never have time.	Numquam tempus habemus.
That's not okay.	Quod non bene.
She left me.	Illa me reliquit.
For me this is true.	Pro me hoc verum est.
Nothing got easier.	Nihil facile obtinuit.
It should be seen as a thing.	Debet videri res.
not just doing something.	Non solum facere aliquid.
Maybe we're not different.	Fortasse non aliud sumus.
This could be done each day.	Posset hoc fieri per dies.
He had help.	Habuit auxilium.
He does something.	Aliquid facit.
I'm really sorry.	Paenitet me vere.
It has not been said.	Non dictum est.
If you haven't already.	Si nondum habet.
I believe him.	ei credo.
I really don't believe you.	Ego vere non credo.
I am going to do this.	Hoc ego facturus sum.
He willed.	Voluit.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
I really wanted to say great things.	Non vere voluit dicere magna.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
Not what he thought it would be.	Non quod fore putabat.
Maybe we can do it now.	Forsitan iam ante id facere possumus.
I knew he was going to do it.	Sciebam id facturum esse.
I need help.	Mihi opus est auxilio.
Why? 	Quare?
it is necessary to speak.	loqui necesse est.
Yesterday was with me.	Heri mecum fuit.
I need to go home.	Ire domum debeo.
it is not for us.	non est nobis.
Do what you just do.	Fac id quod tu modo facis.
Which can be true.	Quod verum esse potest.
I never could tell you.	Numquam tibi dicere potuit.
Just love you!	Iustus amo!
That's pretty much what we have right now.	Quod satis valde placet quod nunc habemus.
He did well.	Bene faceret.
Do it often, you know.	Saepe facias, scis.
This was a job.	Hoc erat officium.
I just don't have time for me.	Modo non habeo iam in me.
Nor is it .	Nec est .
I can't say enough.	Non possum satis dicere.
But he was not aware of it.	Sed non erat id scire.
This had only first aid.	Hoc primum tantum auxilium habuit.
Not even today.	Non hodie quidem.
He was just gone.	Erat iustus abiit.
Has school.	Scholam habet.
This is not what you want.	Hoc non est quod vis.
There	Ibi.
It was not in him.	In non ipsum erat.
He did this in the same way.	Hoc modo fecerit.
I don't like you dog.	Non amo te, canis.
These things I saw and had.	Haec vidi et habui.
It used to be pretty.	Satis esse solebat.
Certainly not with him.	Certe non cum eo.
I have enough money.	Satis pecuniae habeo.
But it is evil.	Malum tamen est.
But he knew it would not be so.	Sed sciebat non ita futurum esse.
I've never been there.	Nunquam ibi fui.
No one knows who it is.	Nemo scit quae sit.
I knew it was not possible.	Scivi non posse.
You can always be alone.	Tu solus semper esse potes.
But not before.	Sed non ante quam.
He has a name.	Nomen habet.
My advice is certain.	Certum est mihi consilium meum.
Much, much.	Multum, multum.
He could not find him.	Non potuit invenire eum.
At last she was still alive.	Tandem adhuc fuit.
That's us.	Id nobis.
What to do.	Quid facere.
It was where you said it.	Erat, ubi dixisti.
But it was too late.	Sed sero factum est.
He gave him one.	Dedit ei unum.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
I wish you a really good help right now.	Utinam vere bene auxilium nunc.
Who I fight for.	Qui me pro.
I think it's good for him.	Puto bonum ei.
This is generally difficult.	Hoc fere difficile est.
He wanted to speak again.	Iterum loqui voluit.
I know wrong.	Scio malum.
We're fine.	Bene sumus.
Why? 	Quare?
He ought not to hear this, not from it.	Audire hoc non debet, non ab illa.
I never wanted it.	Numquam volui eam.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
Whether it is true or not is not a question.	Utrum verum sit necne, quaestio non est.
It is just getting good.	Is est iustus questus bonus est.
What was, was.	Quid erat, erat.
Who is? 	Quis est?
I thought it was going to be.	dixi futurum esse.
Thus he speaks.	Sic loquitur.
I am just.	iustus sum.
I was very busy.	Valde occupatus essem.
Boy am I to do this.	Puer sum ad hoc.
It was for her.	Eam ei erat.
i wanted in.	volui in.
It was said poorly of me.	Male de me dictum est.
He always said that he didn't know how to do it.	Semper dixit se nescire facere.
Not from you.	Non ex vobis.
But she was unwilling to listen.	Sed illa audire nolebat.
Something in it perhaps.	Aliquid in eo fortasse.
It was time.	Tempus erat.
There was something there.	Aliquid ibi fuit.
And he still doesn't know.	Et adhuc nescit.
This was enough.	Hoc satis fuit.
I don't really want to talk too much.	Non vere etiam loqui volo.
There is nothing to talk about.	Nihil loqui est.
You are the one who has the problem.	Tu es qui quaestionem habet.
and it will always be.	et semper erit.
But that was it.	Sed id erat enim.
I just don't know how to do my job.	Modo nescio quomodo officium meum facere.
Great.	Magna.
He does not know.	Nescit.
I don't have time to baby.	Non tempus ut puer.
he did not know that he knew.	nesciebat se scire.
There is no, there is not all in it.	Non est, non est omnia in eo.
He didn't want? 	Noluit?
It was just so.	Factum est sicut ita.
It is not gone.	Non sic abiit.
Tell me it's not true.	Dic mihi verum non est.
When this was done.	Cum hoc factum est.
Maybe that's all for us.	Forsitan omnes id in nobis.
Something to say to him, but not to it.	Dicere aliquid ei, sed id non.
Do what you do best.	Fac quod optime facis.
But now there's a lot to do.	Sed sit amet nunc nulla.
It has always been so for me.	Ita mihi semper fuit.
What are you going to do.	Quod facturus es.
That is me.	Illa mihi est.
I am only trying to be good.	Sum solus bonus esse conatur.
Which is not seen.	Quod non videtur.
He could not hear.	Non potuit audire.
He is getting help.	Et auxilium questus est.
He was a very good boy.	Puer valde bonus erat.
It is getting ready.	Questus est paratus.
We need to know this.	Hoc scire opus est.
I know there are days you don't like it.	Scio dies sunt tibi non placet.
He gave it to him.	Dedit in eum.
That's not a whole lot.	Id totum non multum.
No, he wants to do things.	Non, velit facere quae.
I just don't know where we can see it.	Modo non ubi eam videre possumus.
Anyone who wants to do something.	Facere aliquid velit qui quis.
Say what you want.	Dic quod vis.
for he knew what was true.	Sciebat enim, quod verum erat.
It will be.	Erit.
I just needed to hear it again.	Modo opus erat iterum audire.
it's all going to happen.	Omnes futurum est.
Everything you need to know.	Omnia scire debes.
He could do a lot, though.	Multum potuit, sed.
And the man too.	Et vir quoque.
Not me.	Non me.
There is no need to act and there is no need to stop.	Non opus est agere et prohibere opus est.
and someone did.	et aliquem fecit.
But he was in none.	Sed in nulla erat.
He could do a little more now.	Paulo plus nunc facere potuit.
It was time to leave.	Tempus erat relinquere.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
he could not speak.	loqui non potuit.
This is the first thing to like.	Hoc primum est ad aliquid simile.
got married.	Obtinuit uxorem.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
Someone to understand.	Aliquem intelligere.
Even now it was.	Etiam vel nunc erat.
No one was sure why.	Cur nemo erat certus.
I know this.	id scio.
That doesn't seem to me.	Id mihi non videtur.
It has to be.	Habet esse.
It was a bad thing.	Malum erat.
Even in which.	Etiam in quam.
But this was not.	Sed hoc non fuit.
You are sure.	Certus es.
He will be among me.	Hic inter me erit.
That is, he did nothing.	Id est, nihil fecit.
which I could now do.	quod nunc facere potui.
But he is also now.	Sed et ipsum nunc.
This never occurred.	Hoc nunquam occurrit.
Are you still there? 	Adhuc ibi es?
Not for us but for you.	Non nobis sed tibi.
Or trying to be.	Vel conatur esse.
That's where we are.	Id ubi sumus.
Well done! 	Bene!
he says great things.	magna dicit.
Nothing else was needed.	Nihil aliud opus fuit.
I'm with someone.	Im apud aliquem.
Stay where you are, but don't speak.	Mane ubi sis, sed noli loqui.
I love him so much.	tantum eum amo.
let her be.	Sit eius, sit.
I do not know what.	nescio quid.
when you do it.	Cum id tibi.
I and you alone.	Ego et tu solum.
I don't know whether this is true or not.	Nescio an hoc verum sit necne.
Look after him.	Vide post eum.
They are all the same.	Idem omnes.
That's the thing.	Id rem.
It is not necessary after this period.	Non est necesse post id tempus.
This means a lot to everyone.	Hoc est multum omnibus.
Not quickly.	Non cito.
I hope you like it here.	Spero tibi placet hic.
He can find something else.	Aliud invenire potest.
No one can help him.	Nemo eum adiuvare potest.
This before.	Hoc ante.
today I don't know.	hodie nescio.
And he said to him: Tell me what you said.	Qui dixit ei: Dic mihi quod dixisti.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
You can do it yourself too.	Etiam id ipsum potes.
So get out.	Ita ut ex.
Never been great before.	Numquam magna ante.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
Go wherever you want.	Ire quo vis.
He wanted to tell this.	Hoc narrare voluit.
You want me to help you.	Vis me adiuvare te.
You are with me now.	Nunc mecum es.
I know I want to have this.	Scio me velle hanc habere.
This is	Hoc est.
Nothing else he can do.	Nihil aliud facere potest.
He is a good man.	Homo, bonus est.
You may know that he is not here.	Scire potes eum hic non esse.
You want to do well.	Bene facere vis.
Thus he had.	Sic habuit.
Never stop.	Numquam prohibere.
I think all of us really need it right now.	Puto vere omnes nunc nobis opus est.
I'll be late to work.	Ego nuper ad opus erit.
Yes, that's the same thing now.	Etiam id nunc ipsum.
It seemed to be working.	Videbatur opus esse.
I've never done that so good.	Nunquam feci, ut bonus.
He could do it.	Posset id.
More than that, I need you.	Plus quam, opus est tibi.
If you can't see through yourself, it's also bad.	Si per te ipsum videre non potes, etiam malum est.
I was told there was a problem.	Dictum est mihi non erat quaestio.
He likes not to have.	Velit non habere.
If you need anything, you can talk to me.	Si quid opus est, me potes dicere.
Look at yourself.	Vide te ipsum.
Hardly to talk to someone.	Vix loqui cum aliquo.
I am not quite sure.	Non sum satis certus.
I knew what was going to happen.	sciebam quid futurum esset.
That's something else.	Quod aliquid aliud.
I wanted to be alone with you for a while.	Solus tecum esse volui ad tempus.
He never wants to do it himself.	Numquam id ipsum velit.
but he went with him.	sed abiit cum eo.
But something is better than nothing.	Sed aliquid melius est quam nihil.
We'd like to be friends.	Libet nos amicos esse.
I think he just wants us to understand.	Puto tantum velle nos intelligere.
This he did to me.	Hoc mihi fecit.
It is not certain.	Certum non est.
No one knows for sure.	Nemo certe scit.
But better now.	Sed melius nunc.
That's what you always want to do.	Id quod te facere semper vis.
See you for dinner.	Te videre prandium.
But he does this one thing.	Sed hoc unum facit.
I just knew there was one thing I needed.	Modo sciebat unum opus esse.
I knew you wanted to hear more about it.	Sciebam te de eo audire velle.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Maybe even he could.	Aliquam vel potuit.
I do well.	Bene facio.
Money, for example.	Pecuniam, enim.
And that is good.	Et illud bonum est.
I don't need to do it again.	Non opus est iterum facere.
But at the same time it is not really enough for the purpose.	Non tamen vere simul satis est ad rem.
But someone is sure of something.	Sed aliquis est certus ad aliquid.
No man wanted to stay.	Nemo homo manere vellet.
It really doesn't.	Is vere non facit.
But why.	Sed cur.
It is not better.	Non est melius.
we are where we are.	ubi sumus sumus.
There was more here.	Plus hic fuit.
I'd like to go back again.	Iterum ire libet.
I don't need you to do anything else.	Non opus est tibi facere aliud.
It will not be so among you.	Non ita erit inter vos.
Not even this.	Ne hac quidem.
It was too much, too soon.	Nimium erat, nimium cito.
I have not seen.	Non vidi.
You are.	Tu es.
I have nothing to do all at once.	Non habeo quod omnia simul faciam.
But it was too hard.	Sed nimis difficile erat.
It is important to say before.	Aliquam sit amet dictum ante.
I'm not with him.	Non sum apud ipsum.
None but none of us.	Nulla sed nulla nobis.
May take some.	Sit ut aliquam.
Seems like too much money.	Videtur nimium pecuniam.
Maybe that's none of it.	Aliquam id nulla ex.
He would not come.	Noluit venire.
I could not do this without you.	Hoc sine te facere non potuit.
in not mentioned.	In non dictum est.
Do as much as you can.	Fac quantum potes.
He can live again.	Iterum vivere potest.
I have a house.	Habeo domum.
It does not come after you.	Is post te non venit.
I like someone help.	Mihi placet aliquis auxilium.
There was no time to do so.	Nulla id nunc erat.
This is necessary.	Hoc necesse est.
It is getting better in this.	Melius in hoc questus est.
I don't love you much, really.	Non multum amo, vere.
He is a man.	Is est homo.
Which ones are	Quae sunt.
Nothing is seen.	Nihil videtur.
Can anyone help me.	Potest quis me adiuvet.
Someone to do it.	Aliquis facere id.
It is certain that I am.	Certum est me esse.
You make all men.	tu facis omnes homines.
That's right.	Sic recte.
Not so.	Non ita.
Even if he wants to do so.	Etiam id nisi velit.
But he was not here.	Sed hic non erat.
That is not true.	Quod non est.
Who was already there.	Iam quis erat.
He was always in order.	Ut in semper erat.
I didn't want to go badly.	Ire nolui male.
watches.	spectat.
To sit ahead of time.	Ut sit ante tempus.
Just make it so hard.	Iustus eam ita.
Don't come after me.	Post me noli venire.
This is what you really want for me.	Hoc est quod tu mihi vere vis.
I couldn't believe how great it was.	Quam magna esset credere non potui.
But not for a long time.	Sed nec diu.
Nothing else to be done.	Nihil aliud sibi faciendum.
I think this is my dad.	Pater meus hic puto.
you have done so much for us.	tantum fecisti nobis.
But he certainly wouldn't.	Noluit autem certe.
day and id.	Dies et id.
No one knows at all what this is.	Quid hoc sit, nemo prorsus novit.
No one was with you.	Nulla quis erat cum.
I can't always hear you.	Te semper audire non possum.
They are in school.	In schola sunt.
This is the day	Haec dies.
This job is not for you.	Hoc officium non est tibi.
But it is not necessary to live with you.	Sed vivere tecum non necesse est.
You look different.	Tu aliud vide.
-non.	-non.
I'd like to hear about it.	Libet audire de illo.
I need you to believe.	Mihi opus est tibi credere.
He does nothing.	Nihil agit.
I don't think it would be.	Non puto fore.
Completely up to you.	Omnino ad vos.
He didn't want me to go.	Ire me noluit.
Yes it is where we are.	Ita est, ubi sumus.
I need some time.	Mihi opus erat aliquo tempore.
This really was our home.	Hoc vere nobis domi fuit.
You know what is going to happen.	Tu quid futurum sit.
And you don't have.	Et non habes.
But yet there was some.	Sed sed aliquam erat.
To say this before.	Ut id ante.
you are the same and not the same.	idem es nec tamen idem.
I couldn't think of anything to say.	Non potuit cogitare quid dicam.
He seemed to see nothing.	Nihil videre videbatur.
But it is not seen.	Sed non videtur.
He says nothing to him.	Nihil dicit ei.
Today is a busy day.	Hodie est dies occupatus.
I don't want to give it to you.	Nolo tibi hoc dare.
I need to get you home.	Te domum debeo.
You can trust us.	Credere potes nobis.
Say what you want.	Dic quid vis.
To say something.	Ad aliquid est.
Not the same.	Non ipsum.
I know that I am.	Scio me esse.
i want you to know it.	eam te scire volo.
I know you don't exist.	Scio te non esse.
He only needs to persuade.	Ille solum opus est ei persuadere.
But not so.	Sed non sic.
See whether he wanted to speak.	Vide an loqui vellet.
Nothing really happened there.	Vere nihil ibi factum est.
We're going to be late.	Sero sumus futurum.
I'm always on the order.	Me semper ex quo.
It was not what he expected.	Non fuit quod putabat.
It's better for me to do it.	Melius mihi faciendum est.
he could not.	non potuit.
it can scarcely be.	vix potest.
He was ready.	Erat paratus.
Right, he knew what he wanted.	Recte, scivit quid vellet.
It's too late for this.	Sero ad hoc.
That is the same thing.	Id ipsum sit.
Time is what you know.	Tempus est quod scis.
Don't even think about it again.	Ne iterum quidem cogitat.
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
I thought often.	Saepe cogitavi.
At length he asked.	Tandem quaesivit.
Just like us.	Sicut nos.
It is likely both.	Verisimile est utrumque.
What I wanted to say.	Quod volui dicere.
You'd like to know.	Scire velis.
I am not sure.	Non sum certus.
Much better than me.	Multo melius quam me.
But there was.	Sed erat.
I was before.	ante fui.
But we.	Sed nos.
He seemed to listen.	Videbatur audire.
But no one wants to.	Sed nec ex velit.
This one loves me.	Hoc est me amat.
I just can't help myself.	Ego iustus non possum me.
This is certain and good.	Hoc certum est et bonum.
This is not true anymore.	Hoc modo non est verum amplius.
It is certain.	Certum est.
I know exactly what it is like.	Novi prorsus quid simile sit.
i never knew what happened.	numquam scivi quid acciderit.
It's good for me!	Mihi bonum est!
You can't be yourself.	Te ipsum esse non potes.
My father was only there at the time.	Pater tantum tempore ibi fuit.
It was like you didn't stop.	Similis erat non prohibere.
Certainly not.	Certe non.
I'm pretty good at it.	Ego satis bonum esse.
We can't really stop you.	Non possumus vere prohibere te.
And it is not difficult.	Et difficile non est.
To be able to do so.	Posse facere.
He wanted good things.	Voluit bona.
What your job does.	Quod tuum officium facit.
She could certainly understand this.	Posset certe intelligere id.
I'm not just saying that.	Im 'non solum dicere.
Which one is the nearest.	Quae proxima est.
I have people.	Habeo homines.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
But they are not.	Sed non sunt.
I will buy at least one.	Ego certe unum emere.
But either.	Sed vel.
Which was quite true.	Quod satis verum erat.
It is so difficult.	Ita difficile est.
But not now.	Sed non iam.
I need to do it.	Opus faciam in eo.
He did not know what he was going to do about him.	Quid de illo facturus esset, nesciebat.
He did not come to her.	Non venit ad eam.
I was late to work.	Sero ad opus fui.
I can't think why.	Non possum cogitare quare.
Really love you.	Vere amo te.
It was like a good name.	Similis erat nomen bonum.
And it was.	Et fuit.
I would not.	Nolui.
Years ago indeed.	Annos vere.
This is certain.	Hoc certum est.
For that matter.	Illud.
Yes okay.	Ita bene.
There is nothing that can be done.	Nihil est quod fieri possit.
It is good, but not good.	Bonum est, sed non bonum.
This year you are.	Hoc anno, tu es.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
I forgot I could do nothing.	Oblitus sum ei nihil aliud facere posse.
Which is very true.	Quod valde verum est.
And after the first time don't even think about it.	Et post primum ne cogitas quidem.
Yes, yes.	Etiam, Etiam.
The man too.	Vir quoque.
Not yet.	Non tamen.
Its indeed.	Eius quidem.
He said this.	Hoc dixit.
Too big a thing.	Nimis magna res est.
I wonder about that.	Miror de illo.
There's a saying here.	Nulla a dictum hic.
No one can stop us.	Nemo nos prohibere potest.
I love him.	Eum amo.
Thus he had.	Ita habuit.
Which one is important here.	Quod autem hic sit amet.
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id dictum ipsum.
It was always so.	Sic semper fuit.
My father wants me to be his wife.	Pater me uxorem vult.
The same, but not the same.	Idem, sed non idem.
Not really kind.	Genus non vere.
But three were right.	Sed recte tres.
I'm glad that it was done well.	Gaudeo quod bene factum est.
That time is important.	Quod tempus sit amet.
i want to make sure.	certum volo.
I can't live.	Non possum vivere.
And there is a big question.	Et est quaestio magna.
You just.	Vos iustus.
You are not right.	Non recte.
Say yes.	Sic dic.
If this is, I don't know.	Hoc si est, nescio.
He can't do this.	Hoc facere non potest.
I was not, but	Non eram, sed.
This was true.	Hoc verum erat.
It was very good for me.	Erat mihi valde bona.
It does not please.	Non placet.
It was great indeed.	Magna certe fuit.
Well, rightly so.	Bene, recte.
I want you to stay with me.	Volo te manere mecum.
Now too much.	Nunc nimis.
Time is enough.	Satis temporis est.
It's fine for you.	Bene tibi est.
I need to have what you have.	Mihi opus est habere quod habes.
But it is difficult to see at night.	Sed nocte videre difficile est.
Please try again later.	Aliquam a dictum est.
The situation is the same.	ita se res habet.
You know what it is.	Scis quid de hoc sit.
And not him.	Et non eum.
never forgot.	Numquam oblitus est.
But it was not before.	Sed non erat ante.
They are the same.	Idem sunt.
And if there	Et si ibi.
Still, good to know.	Adhuc, bonum scire.
But this is not yet enough.	Sed hoc nondum satis est.
You who you are.	Tu qui es.
He didn't like this year.	Sicut hoc anno non fecit.
It is a great thing.	Magna res est.
what to do, what.	Quid facere, quid.
He saw, he knew well.	Vidit bene scivit.
Well, finally he said it.	Bene, tandem dixit.
He could be with us.	Potuit esse nobis.
yes no no.	Etiam non nulla est.
I didn't have anything to say.	Non habuit aliquid dicere.
That's very kind of him.	Quod ipsum genus eius.
But he doesn't want it.	Sed non id velit.
And we can talk again.	Et iterum loqui possumus.
It is not necessary.	Non est necesse.
I wish I could be wrong.	Malum vellem.
It was great.	Erat magna.
I still wonder why it happened at that time.	Miror adhuc cur eo tempore acciderit.
It's good for you.	Bonum est tibi.
But it was said.	Sed dictum erat.
He is not with him.	Non est apud eum.
Both are evil.	Utrumque malum est.
He loves you.	Amat te.
They are men.	Homines sunt.
See that again.	Quod iterum vide.
Now she's gone.	Iam illa abiit.
But as for him.	Sed ut ipsum enim.
This is certain to me.	Hoc mihi certum est.
See you in the morning.	Mane te videre.
I don't need it again.	Non opus est iterum.
It was still time to do something.	Adhuc erat tempus ad aliquid faciendum.
But at that time I thought nothing.	Sed nihil eo tempore putavi.
I know better.	Novi melius.
I'll tell you what you think.	Dicam quid cogitas.
Yes it's true.	Sic suus 'verum.
if you know enough, you can see through him.	si satis scis, per illum videre potes.
says the problem takes some time.	Dicit quaestio aliquam tempus.
Your whole body.	Totum tuum.
Both are also here.	Utrumque etiam hic.
But we can't think of this now.	Sed hoc nunc cogitare non possumus.
Maybe not some.	Aliquam non aliquam.
This was true.	Hoc verum erat.
I have nothing to say.	nihil habeo quod dicam.
And it seemed to be late now.	Et sero nunc esse videbatur.
It probably won't.	Probabile non erit.
I don't need much else.	Nec multum aliud opus est.
Yes, always.	Etiam semper.
But not much time.	Sed non multum temporis.
I believe the same for all.	Idem omnibus credo.
That too he wanted.	Id quoque voluit.
It's already early.	Iam iam mane est.
But it's time to do that.	Aliquam sed est quam.
I tried so hard to do this as hard as possible.	Hoc fieri potest ut tam difficile conatus sum id facere.
Here we are, see us, see us.	Hic sumus, vide nos, vide nos.
Yes, it wasn't bad.	Etiam non erat malum.
Maybe he could not speak.	Fortasse loqui non potuit.
I'm sorry.	Paenitet me.
But there was none other than that.	Sed non erat quam.
I will not say much about this.	De hoc non nimis dicam.
This is for you.	Hoc est, pro vobis.
I was before him.	ante ipsum fui.
I could not find the car either.	Currus vel invenire non potui.
Both should be on time.	Utrumque debet esse in tempore.
There's a lot in it.	In sit amet nulla est.
and still loves in.	et tamen amat in.
So do yours.	Sic fac tua.
For that is.	Id enim est.
You did everything.	Fecisti omnia.
Not much, but at least a little.	Non multum, sed certe parum.
It will not be zero.	Sic non erit nulla.
I love my father.	Pater meus amo.
But there are people like that.	Sed sunt qui ut.
He could not be with me.	Apud me non potuit.
I knew this.	Hoc sciebam.
If ever.	Si umquam.
No you don't.	Nulla non.
He wants nothing more.	Nihil sibi vult amplius.
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
We have nothing to do with this.	Nihil nobis ad hoc faciendum est.
You are now.	Nunc tu es.
Certainly I can do nothing with him.	Certe nihil cum eo facere possum.
But at least he does.	Sed certe agit.
But however.	Sed tamen.
Don't talk anymore.	Noli loqui amplius.
I need to see it.	Mihi opus est videre eam.
How bad they are.	Quam mali sunt.
Which ones are	Quae sunt.
Well, maybe today.	Bene, fortasse hodie.
For it is not so.	Non enim ita est.
Who knows how it is there.	Qui scit quomodo ibi sit.
You have your time.	Habes tempus tuum.
Certainly I can't.	Certe non possum.
He did it to win.	Faceret eum vincere.
I think we have a lot going for us.	Puto nos multum ire pro nobis.
but no one knows.	sed nemo scit.
Never and never.	Numquam et numquam.
You can leave your time now.	Nunc tempus tuum relinquere potes.
As it was never said.	Ut numquam dictum est.
Even not to him.	Etiam nec ipsum.
He was never going to do it.	Numquam facturus erat.
It will not be said.	Dictum non erit.
I can do a lot with him.	Multum possum cum illo.
But he could not.	Sed potuit.
I had never played him before.	Numquam ipsum ante.
It does not mean that it is not good.	Non vult quod non est bonum.
I could not speak for myself.	Ipse loqui non potui.
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
He likes to be honest.	Velit sit amet quam.
That really started it all.	Quod vere incepit omnes.
This would be bad.	Malum hoc esset.
This is my job.	Meum est officium.
if you know, you know.	si scis, scis.
Really does the job.	Vere facit officium.
Maybe it was morning.	Mane fortasse factum est.
perhaps it was.	fortasse fuit.
And yet there was no more.	Quod tamen non esset amplius.
I bought a lot.	Multum me emit.
There again.	Ibi iterum.
These things are.	Haec sunt.
And so this.	Et sic hoc.
But he does not want it, now he does not have it.	Sed id non vult, nunc non habet.
He did this for over a year.	Hoc plus anno fecit.
sorry about this afternoon.	Paenitet de hoc post meridiem.
What's more, she was alone.	Quid amplius solus fuit.
I never met.	Numquam occurrit.
Something has happened to you.	Aliquid factum est in te.
I have never seen this video.	Numquam ego hoc video vidi.
But here we are.	Sed hic sumus.
Just do it now.	Hoc modo fac modo.
This is what he says.	Hoc est quod dicit.
It's getting late.	Sero suus questus est.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
it is before time	ante tempus est.
He's so good at home.	Ille tam bonus est domi.
It was to him now.	Erat ei nunc.
Now the journey is difficult.	Nunc iter difficile est.
You can definitely do that.	Quod ex certo potes.
I don't like it much.	Non multum placet.
He saw that it was so.	Ipse vidi quod sic sit.
Not that much.	Non quod multum.
But he does not say much.	Sed hoc non multum dicit.
Not even today.	Ne hodie quidem.
You should.	Debes.
We ate nothing here.	Nihil nos hic comedit.
I can't do it before.	Non possum ante eam.
He would not listen.	Noluit audire.
No one knows how.	Nemo scit quomodo.
And we can do better than that.	Et melius possumus facere quam illud.
I don't know about you, but I want to talk to you.	Nescio de te, sed me loqui volo.
Or perhaps always.	Vel fortasse semper.
You don't have a lot of time.	Et non multum tempus est.
If you can speak.	Si potes dicere.
Please don't talk to me.	Non placet mihi loqui.
He does not come again.	Non iterum venit.
here you are.	hic es tu.
I wanted him to be done.	eum fieri volui.
This was just what the father did not want to have.	Sicut hoc erat quod pater nolebat habere.
Not sure what to do.	Certo quid facias.
This is really the thing.	Hoc vere res est.
Even so.	Etiam ut.
I don't know what to do anymore.	Quid faciam amplius nescio.
Nothing can prevent it.	Nihil prohibere potest.
I just stay there.	Modo ibi mane.
Something's happened to him.	Aliquid acciderit.
I was just happy.	Iustus eram felix.
I don't want you to go.	Ego te ire non vis.
I know what.	Scio quid.
Never like this.	Numquam sic.
i still feel it.	adhuc sentio.
Please do me.	Quaeso fac me.
This was good.	Hic bene erat.
He would be home soon.	Mox domum se fore.
It was not what he wanted.	Non erat quod voluit.
Tell me your work.	Dic mihi opus tuum.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
It will be your job.	Sic erit officium tuum.
I want to talk to her.	Volo eam loqui.
Nothing else can be.	Nihil aliud potest esse.
He didn't want it.	Noluit eam.
perhaps it was.	fortasse fuit.
I am sure.	certus sum.
My father is gone.	Pater meus abiit.
You can't.	Non potes.
I think there is a lot to be done.	Multum fieri puto.
Even his own.	Etiam suum.
I don't think anything else.	Non puto aliud.
This is about you.	Haec de te.
I don't need to know anything else.	Non opus est scire aliud.
The boy was there.	Puer ibi erat.
This has been done really well.	Hoc vere bene factum est.
We are not sure why that is.	Cur id sit certum non habemus.
I wonder if he will do it.	Miror si hoc facturus sit.
What a thing.	Quam rem.
He really wanted to stay and talk.	Quod vere voluit manere et loqui.
This was almost the same.	Haec fere erat.
But it is not necessary to do this.	Sed hoc facere non est necesse.
But that was not enough.	Sed parum id fuit.
But as it is now.	Sed ut nunc est.
It will not always be so.	Non semper sic erit.
I have nothing else to do.	Non habeo aliud facere.
I do a lot of things.	Multum mihi facio.
It was good to see him there.	Ibi eum videre bonum erat.
I love it.	Illud amo.
He is from someone.	Is ab aliquo.
Now	Nunc.
That is not possible.	Quod non potest.
We don't have time.	Non tempus habemus.
I believe we all did.	Credo nos omnes fecisse.
All things are in him.	Omnia in eo sunt.
See what he can do.	Vide quid possit.
Now I want to see.	Nunc videre volo.
But at least it was better.	Sed certe melius fuit.
No time is available.	Nulla sit amet tempus est.
It was great!	Magna erat!.
At the same time.	Simul.
This was not with us.	Hoc apud nos non fuit.
It's you.	Est tibi.
Never, please.	Numquam, velit.
We can win together.	Simul vincere possumus.
I couldn't stop anything.	Non potui aliquid prohibere.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
This is what I want.	Hoc est quod volo.
He knew what was needed.	Sciebat quid opus esset.
But better than nothing.	Sed melius quam nihil.
He could not speak.	Dicere non potuit.
I want to say something else.	Volo aliquid aliud dicere.
As, really late.	Ut, vere sero.
But my job is to say something, something.	Sed officium meum est aliquid dicere, aliquid.
It is too true.	Nimium verum est.
This is not a plan.	Hoc non est consilium.
Just stay at home.	Iustus domi manere.
That's going to happen to you.	Quod tibi futurum est.
That's what happened.	Id factum.
But see, and there is nothing.	Sed vide, et nihil est ibi.
He said to do it together.	Dixit id facere simul.
That doesn't make it easy.	Quod facile non facit.
And rightly so.	Et recte.
It is not true.	Non est verum.
It is.	Sic est.
Maybe he was already here.	Fortasse iam hic erat.
I can't help you.	Te adiuvare non possum.
He always wants it too.	Etiam id semper velit.
And now it's scared.	Et modo illud vix.
He saw himself.	Vidit ipse.
These are really good.	Haec vere bona sunt.
I think, however, that would be enough.	Puto, tamen, fore satis.
He does well and makes money.	Pecuniam bene facit et facit.
I still don't believe that someone would do it.	Ego tamen non credo aliquem facturum esse.
That can be enough for me.	Quod mihi satis esse potest.
The future for us.	Pro nobis futurum.
No I didn't get any out of it.	Nulla non aliquam ex.
If a.	Si a.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
This is great.	Hic magna est.
I am busy.	Occupatus sum.
I like.	Mihi placet.
You must play with me now.	Ludere mecum debet modo.
But it won't be easy.	Sed non erit facile.
That's how to get.	Id quam ut.
Maybe this too.	Fortasse hoc quoque.
.	.
Everything can be done.	Omnia posse fieri.
You have this good question.	Bona quaestio haec habes.
I truly believe that.	Vere credo.
I thought him and me to be friends.	Putabam eum et me esse amicos.
as it seems.	ut videtur.
Who made his day.	Qui fecit diem suum.
I heard you don't have someone.	Audivi te non habere aliquem.
But it was in him.	Sed in ipsum erat.
I don't think so.	Non puto habere.
So you need something at home.	Sic opus est tibi res domi.
But I can't find it.	Sed id invenire non possum.
Happy day.	Felix dies.
Everything is already pretty.	Omnia iam satis.
That doesn't surprise him.	Id eum non miror.
Say what's wrong with you.	Quid tibi mali videtur dicere.
I do a lot of things.	Multum facio.
And it makes me think.	Et facit me cogitare.
But this was evil.	Sed hoc malum fuit.
Maybe not only.	Aliquam non nisi.
But we are too.	Sed nimium sumus.
I have done nothing.	Nihil feci.
I'll do it, and it's necessary to go.	Ego faciam, et ire necesse est.
Or before that.	Vel ante id.
We really don't have time to stay longer.	Vere non tempus habemus diutius manere.
To not get out of it yourself.	Ut non ex ipsum.
That this may be true.	Quod ut verum sit.
Probably.	Probabiliter.
These things happen, you know.	Haec fieri, scis.
He never told me anything.	Numquam mihi aliquid indicavit.
It has been long enough.	Satis diu fuit.
I just can't get it.	Modo non potest eam.
Not out.	Nec e.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
When in school too.	Cum per scholam quoque.
He said nothing in him.	Nihil dixit in illo.
It's so easy.	Tam facile factum est.
I'm not so sure anymore.	Non sum ita certus amplius.
He had everything.	Omnia habuit.
We are there.	Ibi sumus.
Certainly I am.	Certe ego.
It's hard if you have anything.	Difficile, si quid habes.
There is no time for us here.	Tempus non est nobis hic.
It hardly seems to matter.	Ad rem vix videtur.
No one had anything to say.	Nemo quicquam habuit quod dicam.
Better not to say too much.	Melius ne nimium dicam.
And it was.	Et fuit.
There is always a story.	Aliquam a semper est.
Well, that's all about it.	Bene, id est de omnibus.
Now, say.	Nunc, dic.
This he ought to do.	Hoc facere debet.
To sit.	Ut sit.
I know he will do it.	scio, facturum esse.
but there will be something.	sed erit aliquid.
But who knows.	Sed quis scit.
Maybe in a year it won't happen.	Forsitan in anno, non erit.
Please, please.	Quaeso, quaeso.
It looked the same as it always was.	Videbatur idem quod semper.
There is something in it.	In aliquid est.
But this is so for us.	Sed hoc ita est etiam nobis.
My real work.	Meum verum opus.
It's the same thing.	Suus 'idem.
This year I wanted to go.	Hoc anno ire volui.
There's never a problem.	Nulla umquam quaestio est.
This is not true.	Hoc non est verum.
i feel it would make me sick.	sentio fore me male.
I need to do it.	Mihi opus est facere.
I hope to see you again soon some day.	Spero te iterum videre, mox aliquo die.
He didn't want to know.	Noluit scire.
I had to stop and think about it.	Habui me prohibere et cogitare de illo.
It probably thought it was better than it was.	Probabile putavit melius esse quam erat.
He does not know me.	Me non novit.
It would seem that he did not want anything else.	Videtur quod aliquid aliud nolebat.
But no longer at all.	Sed non iam nulla.
One was enough.	Satis unus erat.
It's not yours.	Non est tua.
That's good.	Sic bona.
He did not know who his father was.	Nesciebat quis pater esset.
He spoke thus.	Sic dixit.
And now I need it.	Et iam in eo opus est.
I'm sorry, but this is it.	Me paenitet, sed haec est.
This can be done.	Fieri hic potest.
How was this done? 	Quomodo hoc factum est?
That name is nothing to me either.	Id nomen nihil mihi quidem.
Now he is gone.	Iam abiit.
None or from him.	Nulla vel ex ipsum.
He did so much evil.	Tam malum fecit.
Maybe you too.	Fortasse tu quoque.
I want you so much.	Vos volo tantum.
It's actually pretty good.	Est vere satis bona.
Breakfast.	Prandium.
It is really good.	Vere bonum est.
Well, really we can.	Bene, vere possumus.
When there is need, there is need.	Cum opus est, opus est.
No one knows who you are yet.	Nescit quis adhuc sis.
This is not right now.	Hoc nunc non est.
If all.	Quod si omnes.
Boy are you late.	Puer sero es.
I don't like things.	Res non placet.
That's already done.	Quod iam factum est.
And they are still men.	Et adhuc homines sunt.
for there is no future for us.	nobis enim futurum non est.
We cannot do this.	Hoc facere non possumus.
Wants to do something.	Velit facere aliquid.
For he could do something else.	Posset enim aliud agere.
I don't know what you mean to say.	Nescio quid vis dicere.
But this was evil.	Sed hoc malum fuit.
but it	sed eam.
I really have nothing to do with it.	Ego vere nihil ad rem.
It is easy to do.	Facile est hoc facere.
if not today, it will be tomorrow.	si non hodie, cras erit.
This was certain.	Hoc certum erat.
There is nothing else but.	Nihil est aliud nisi.
He wants to get away from nothing.	Ut a nulla velit.
That's a journey.	Id iter.
I have done my work.	opus meum feci.
We can't find help.	Auxilium invenire non possumus.
That should be something.	Id aliquid debet.
No one wanted to talk.	Nemo voluit loqui.
I was not alone.	Solus non eram.
He knows what you know he made you.	Scit quod tu scis ipse te fecit.
He did not ask.	Non quaesivit.
That's me before.	Id mihi ante.
Everyone loves money.	Omnes pecuniam amat.
I really didn't want to go.	Ego vere ire noluit.
I would do so.	Facerem.
But not too soon.	Sed non nimium cito.
Maybe someone else was like that.	Forsitan aliquis similis fuit.
I said myself.	Dixi ipse.
You know better.	Tu melius scis.
It was time for him.	Erat tempus ipsum.
Even the time was said and not said.	Etiam tempus dictum quam nec dictum.
He did not know what happened.	Nesciebat quid.
This is what has been done.	Hoc est quod factum est.
I don't think it would be.	Non puto fore.
Now she is mine.	Nunc mea est.
I like it.	Placet ei.
That's how it is now.	Ut id quam nunc.
For us, it just started.	Pro nobis, mox incepit.
He truly loves me.	Vere amat mecum.
But there was not any.	Sed non aliquam erat.
There is no time for fun.	Aliquam sit amet tempus nulla.
Maybe he didn't want to talk about it.	Forsitan de eo loqui noluit.
The father comes home.	Pater domum venit.
It's something very important either.	Ipsum aliquid amet vel est.
I wanted to do something a little.	Paulo aliquid vellem.
That seems to be a lot of things.	Quod multum videtur.
He did not know what happened.	Nesciebat quid.
This, however, is not enough.	Hoc tamen non satis certum est.
This is much better.	Hoc multo melius.
He also knew when.	Sciebat etiam quando.
Yes and it was time.      	Etiam et tempus erat.      
Stay still.	Mane adhuc.
He was not a man.	non erat homo.
He wants to be himself.	Ipsum sit velit.
It was good for me.	Bene mihi fuit.
I don't know which one it is.	Nescio quod unum sit.
This also is not true.	Hoc etiam non est verum.
Everything is there.	Omnia ibi.
But not bad.	Sed non male.
I know him too well.	Novi eum nimium bene.
He was my father.	pater erat.
She could say something to him.	Posset aliquid ei dicere.
I don't know people.	Non novi homines.
No, certainly not.	Non, certe non.
That this may be true.	Quod ut verum sit.
Yes and only time.	Etiam et tempus nisi.
But I don't know why.	Sed non cur.
There was this.	Fuit hoc.
And it is not seen.	Et non videtur.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
You are mine.	Meus es.
But it is time.	Sed tempus est.
He was also in some respects.	Etiam in aliquam erat.
I had to say yes please.	Non habui quod sic loqui tibi placet.
We're not good enough for you.	Non satis sumus tibi.
But that's no time.	Sed id tempus nulla.
There instead of id.	Ibi pro id.
The question did not come.	Quaestio non venit.
You don't have to do this.	Hoc facere non habes.
You do for yourself.	Facis tibi.
To me what it is.	Mihi quid eft.
If you need it.	Tu, si opus sit.
So you like me.	Sic et vos sicut me.
You are the same with him.	Tu idem cum eo.
That's how he played it.	Ut id ipsum quam.
All of it.	Ex eo omnes.
He did not say the name.	Non dixit nomen.
I like this very much.	Hoc mihi valde placet.
It was always now.	Nunc semper erat.
But it certainly looks bad.	Sed certe malum spectat.
No it's not what it looks like.	Nemo non est quod videtur.
I never know it's done.	Numquam scit factum est.
You did it, boy.	Fecisti, puer.
That's what I need.	Quod mihi opus est.
You'd better be there.	Melius est ibi velis.
They are as good as we have in school.	Tam bona sunt quam in schola habemus.
I'd go for it.	Pro eo ire vellem.
Maybe the same thing here.	Idem fortasse hic.
But never before.	Sed numquam ante.
You know you have something to say.	Scis te aliquid dicere.
I never get to it.	Numquam ad eam.
We are scared now.	Modo vix sumus.
How are they in it.	Ut sunt in illo.
Yes it's true.	Sic suus 'verum.
This is not the father.	Hoc non est pater.
I just couldn't do it.	Ego iustus facere non potui.
It was the same thing to do.	Erat id ipsum facere.
i hope it's not too late.	quod non sero spero.
We cannot say this.	Hoc dicere non possumus.
He only knows.	Ille solum novit.
It is easy.	Facile est.
He didn't want to go.	Noluit ire.
If she made it home.	Si illa fecit domum.
You are here with me.	Hic mecum es.
It looked what he did.	Videbatur quod fecit.
He said that it was too late.	Sero dixit esse.
It's just lonely.	Suus 'tantum solum.
He is not listening.	Non est audire.
Soon I will.	Mox volo.
What he does.	Quod facit.
He could, however.	Potuit, sed.
It's not so bad.	Non ita est malum.
I just want to tell you.	EGO iustus volo tibi dicere.
Don't try again.	Noli iterum.
So again it was.	Ita iterum esset.
To be very happy.	Sit amet ipsum ut.
It was his day.	Hodie eius fuit.
See if your business is very nice.	Vide admodum si tua res est.
What else.	Quid aliud.
Sort of like that.	Genus simile ex eo.
In this way I know.	Hoc modo scio.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
He does nothing.	Nihil facit.
I have heard many things about you.	Multa de te audivi.
I just don't want to.	Modo non vis.
It is certain that I am.	Certum est me esse.
That's it for some.	Ut id aliquam est.
This has just been done.	Hoc modo factum est.
He probably understood nothing.	Probabile nihil intellexit.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
He asked what had happened.	Quaesivit quid factum sit.
I do that.	Ego illud facio.
He could not find it.	Invenire non potuit.
I was late to class one morning.	Eram sero ad mane unum genus.
None of that was any.	Nulla id aliquam erat.
I don't know what it is.	Nescio quid sit.
Many.	Multum.
there he left me alone.	ibi me solum reliquit.
You can also understand.	Etiam intelligere potes.
I can't talk to him.	Non possum dicere ei.
It was good.	Bonum erat.
I think you need to be home.	Puto te domum opus esse.
But not.	Sed non.
That's it for tomorrow.	Cras id enim.
He wanted more.	Plus voluit.
This is my boy.	Hic puer meus est.
Maybe that was him.	Aliquam id erat ipsum.
You are now on your own.	Tu nunc in tua.
You're going to be there.	Facis ut est.
Finally he does.	Tandem facit.
And you need to get one too.	Et unum quoque debes accipere.
But what is the name?	Sed quid est nomen.
It was really good for us.	Ita vere bonum nobis fuit.
But it was not him.	Sed non erat ipsum.
That's it now.	Id nunc.
This is another name.	Hoc aliud nomen est.
But this is enough for me.	Sed hoc satis est mihi.
It's all over again.	Totum iterum est.
See you tomorrow!	Cras te videre!
What is? 	Quid est?
You are not right.	Non recte.
All in all.	Omnino ad.
You know my plan.	Scis consilium meum.
he is	ipse est.
But don't stop doing right where you can.	Sed noli prohibere recte agere ubi potes.
I just never played anything.	Ego iustus numquam ex eo aliquid.
It was already enough.	Jam satis erat.
He left nothing.	Nihil reliquit ille.
But don't do it again.	Sed ne iterum facias.
I need him to know.	eum scire mihi opus est.
You do not wish to be well with yourself, but to be well with you.	Non bene tibi quidem, sed tibi bene esse velis.
I don't know what will happen.	quid futurum sit nescio.
He never said what it was.	Numquam dixit quid esset.
I don't want him to see these things.	Nolo eum haec videre.
I was there.	ibi fui.
We like what we like.	Placet nobis quod placet.
Before everything.	Ante omnia.
I don't want to hear you say it ever again.	Nolo audire te iterum semper dicere.
I am not sure.	Non sum certus.
he did both.	utrumque fecit.
I just didn't think it would happen.	Modo non fore videbatur.
He must understand.	Intelligere debet.
Not quickly.	Non cito.
That's what he wants.	Id ipsum quis velit.
Which is not true.	Quod non est verum.
Maybe he could learn.	Fortasse scire posset.
And they are.	Et sunt.
I want to hear.	Audire volo.
It seemed easy to him.	Facile ei videbatur.
But that's not the same thing.	Sed id non ipsum.
You are happy this season.	Hoc tempore felix es.
For it has been said.	Dictum est enim.
I tried to talk about it.	Conatus sum de eo loqui.
It was not like it was.	Ut non erat erat.
I truly believe that.	Vere credo.
He said that it was his own.	Suum esse dixit.
It truly is.	Vere est.
I hope someone does, but someone else will not be me.	Spero quod aliquis facit, sed aliquis non erit me.
It was a lot of time and not enough time to see.	Multum erat videre nec tempus satis.
This is the case.	Hoc ita se res habet.
He is not here.	Non est hic.
It was not likely.	Verisimile non erat.
very, very, very, very hard.	valde, valde, valde, vix.
It is time.	Tempus est.
But it was something.	Sed aliquid erat enim.
I don't think you would do that.	Non puto te facturum esse.
And now we have.	Et iam habemus.
I thought it was bad.	Putavi male esse.
and this he did.	et hoc fecit.
This is not to say there is no more.	Hoc ne dicam non est amplius.
He was the father.	Pater erat.
I can not.	Non possum.
Just say this now.	Hoc modo dic modo.
He says he will talk to me.	Dicit se mecum loqui.
How do you plan to do this.	Quomodo hoc facere cogitas.
Men not so much.	Homines, non tam.
You can do it now.	Nunc id facere potes.
You did not.	Non fecisti.
And that day will be better than today.	Et melius erit dies illa quam hodie.
yes you can't get some out of it.	Etiam non aliquam ex.
Exactly why it is not certain, but he does it.	Prorsus cur non certum est, sed facit.
Not from us.	Non ex nobis.
I didn't say a little.	Non dixi parum.
I will not speak to him.	Ego non dicam ei.
He didn't want to think.	Noluit cogitare.
To-morrow in the said ex.	Cras in dictum ex.
But he wants to be himself, not from.	Sed ut ipsum velit, non ex.
No, not him right now.	Nulla non ipsum nunc.
But never.	Sed numquam.
It was about us.	Fere nobis erat.
That she did.	Id fecit.
This was not.	Hoc non erat.
She refused to give up.	Illa dare noluit.
I don't see why.	Non video cur.
You've got to go.	Te obtinuit ut.
I think it would be.	Puto fore.
I hope you are doing well.	Spero bene tibi sunt.
I don't really know why.	Non vere scit cur.
That's a lot of things.	Sic multum.
We're not gonna do what we're gonna do.	Non amet quod nos facere amet.
There is no time today.	Tempus non est hodie.
But this was not.	Sed hoc non fuit.
Who did not see.	Quis non vidit.
You should buy plenty.	Multa emere debes.
It was yours.	Tuum erat.
Great man is great.	Magna quis magna.
I'm in my underwear.	Me in mea ubi.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
She'll be there soon.	Mox ibi erit illa.
In .	Apud .
That's it before him.	Ut id ante ipsum.
He knew when he was home.	Sciebat cum domi esset.
Not as much.	Non quam.
See that again.	Quod iterum vide.
Everybody does something first.	Omnes facit aliquid primum.
Both are true.	Utrumque verum est.
But not from him.	Sed non ipsum ex.
I don't know what else.	Nescio quid aliud.
It is never okay.	Numquam bene.
It's true.	Suus 'verum.
No one knows what it is.	Nemo scit quid sit.
But there was only one.	Sed non erat nisi.
I really travel a lot.	Ego multum vere iter.
But that's only one thing.	Sed id nisi unum.
The same, however.	Idem tamen.
He had just something else about him.	Sicut aliquid aliud de eo habuit.
But it is not something.	Sed non aliquam est.
At the same time together.	Simul in unum.
He saw nothing.	Nihil vidit.
It looks like that.	Similis quod.
Can not.	Non potest.
He made himself think.	Cogitare se fecit.
It was this.	Erat hoc.
Say as much as anyone.	Dicere quantum quis.
i am not okay.	Ego nec bene.
I don't have to talk to you for fun.	Non habet loqui ut te amet.
It could be tonight.	Posset hac nocte.
She refused to go.	Illa ire noluit.
Just don't sit still.	Iustus non sit adhuc.
You are there.	Tibi sunt ibi.
I have the future now.	futurum nunc habeo.
Now it is mine.	Nunc meus est.
Maybe it's not great.	Aliquam non magna est.
Today is one day.	Hodie dies unus est.
Maybe not always great.	Aliquam non semper magna.
Tonight was one.	Hac nocte una esset.
.	.
It is fun to cum.	Sit amet ut cum.
That's a house.	Id domum.
It will be easy.	Facile erit.
I'm working on something like this right now.	Im 'opus in aliquid simile hoc nunc.
You are still in school.	Adhuc in schola.
You say something.	Te aliquid dicere.
I think the car did its job.	Currus officium suum fecisse puto.
But not the same thing.	Sed non id ipsum.
I can say nothing about this.	De hoc nihil possum dicere.
It was from the Police.	Aliquam a erat erat.
Someone could say that it was not true.	Posset aliquis dicere quod non erat verum.
That time was great.	Ut tempus dictum magna.
No, he said to himself what could not be done.	Non, quod fieri non potest, dixit sibi.
You are right too.	Recte etiam.
The same thing	Idem.
I feel at home.	Domi sentio.
I'm almost there.	Fere ibi sum.
Which also seemed possible.	Quod etiam fieri posse videbatur.
That's what he did.	Id quod fecit.
He saw him again.	Vidit eum iterum.
Mariam right.	Mariam recte.
Right, there.	Recte, ibi.
I didn't know this was going to happen.	Nesciebam hic futurum.
Got it.	Obtinuit eam.
It is definitely something to do.	Certus est quid facere.
But they never got me.	Sed numquam obtinuit me.
I'm not sorry.	Non me paenitet.
He knew what.	Sciebat quid.
What else should he do.	Quid aliud faceret.
This one doesn't work for me.	Hoc autem non est opus mihi.
i never did.	numquam feci.
We can't have both.	Utrumque habere non possumus.
You have done well.	Recte fecisti.
But he could not think of this.	Sed hoc non potuit cogitare.
That was really bad.	Quod vere malum esset.
She did this last year.	Id fecit anno.
But you can't go.	Sed ire non potes.
He says also.	Dicit etiam.
To-morrow I'll be late.	Cras sero faciam.
The boy who did it.	Puer, qui fecit.
It's not enough work.	Non satis opus est.
But not in this.	Sed non in hoc.
This is too much.	Nimis hic est.
He is.	Is est.
That I like to be.	Quod ego amo esse.
I didn't know what it was.	Ego nesciebam quod esset.
but he said that he could see.	sed dixit se videre posse.
I need to go home.	Opus est domum ire.
You can do whatever you like.	Facere potes quod libet.
That is difficult.	Id difficile est.
They are one by one.	Unum unum sunt.
I wonder what he did.	Miror quid fecerit.
Well that's what I was doing.	Bene id facerem.
To school.	Ad scholam.
No one wants to be said.	Nulla ut dictum velit.
This is where he is.	Haec ubi est.
This could not have been evil.	Hoc malum esse non potuit.
He still has this.	Hoc adhuc habet.
I just got it.	Ut nunc obtinuit eam.
I believe this could be done.	Id fieri posse credo.
Tonight was not bad for us.	Hac nocte non erat nobis malum.
So it is.	Ita est.
But we can do nothing about it.	Sed nihil de illo possumus.
I just want to be me.	EGO iustus volo a me esse.
No one wants any.	Nulla id aliquam velit.
We are not.	Non sumus.
But yet it was time.	Sed sed tempus erat.
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
But it took me a long time to get there.	Sed me diu illuc.
home	in domum suam.
And this time is certain.	Et hoc tempus certum est.
My name is too much.	Nimis mihi nomen est.
So he thought.	Ita putavit.
He knew, however, that it was not.	Sciebat tamen non fuisse.
It's not about you, it's about me.	Hoc non est de te, hoc est de me.
Maybe not.	Fortasse non.
Not soon enough.	Non satis cito.
And so he did.	Et ita fecit.
You.	Sit tibi.
But we can do this very thing with certainty.	Sed id ipsum certo facere possumus.
I just wanted you to know.	Modo te scire volui.
He didn't say anything.	Aliquid non dixit.
yes one's great.	Etiam quis magna.
There it was.	Ibi fuit.
But I don't need much time.	Sed non multum temporis opus est.
I love you a lot.	Multum te amo.
No great things now.	Nulla magna nunc.
Enough yet.	Satis adhuc.
We don't have enough money for it.	Non satis pecuniae pro illo non habemus.
We have time to plan.	Tempus habemus ad consilium.
He likes it at the right time.	Velit id tempore et.
No one saw him.	Nemo eum vidit.
This cannot be true.	Hoc verum esse non potest.
Well you have.	Bene habes.
You mean it.	Vis est.
But it could also be better than it is.	Potuit autem etiam melius esse quam est.
In order.	In ut.
Appreciate him or anyone.	Bene eum vel quis.
This is kind enough.	Genus hoc satis est.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
We can't stop it now.	Non possumus eam nunc prohibere.
Got my period.	Obtinuit tempus meum.
You can buy today.	Emere potes hodie.
That first cannot be evil.	Primum illud malum esse non potest.
Soon it has to be.	Mox habet esse.
He cannot know this.	Hoc scire non potest.
But the time was like before.	Sed tempus erat ut ante.
You don't want me to think this way.	Hoc modo cogitare non vis.
This has been done before.	Hoc ante factum est.
Well, that's not quite true.	Bene, non satis verum est.
I am surprised now.	Miror modo.
And it was not good.	Et non erat bonum.
I wanted to stop thinking.	Cogitare volui prohibere.
Maybe it's better.	Fortasse melius est.
yes no no.	Etiam non nulla.
My name was on it too.	Mihi nomen in illo quoque fuit.
He was not himself.	Non erat ipse.
I just wanted you to think.	Modo te volui putare.
I know where it is.	Scio ubi sit.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
He gave this to me.	Hoc mihi dedit.
He has not.	non habet.
He asked him what he wanted.	Quaesivit ab eo quid vellet.
I still don't believe.	Adhuc non credere.
We can't say for sure.	Pro certo dicere non possumus.
Everything could be done good.	Posset omnia fieri bona.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
He can do this better.	Hoc melius potest.
You've been like a father.	Tu ut pater fuit.
Her father was behind her again.	Pater eius post eam iterum fuit.
This is my job.	Hoc est officium meum.
But it was only.	Sed non nisi erat.
He was well prepared.	Bene erat paratus.
It has no better.	Hoc melius non habet.
That's not what I said out of it.	Ut non dictum ex.
Maybe it was something else entirely.	Fortasse aliud omnino fuit.
At length I did it.	Tandem feci.
So it is.	Ita est.
I said nothing to him.	nihil ei dixi.
Maybe that was none.	Aliquam erat id nulla.
That was	Quod erat.
That's the only way.	Id solum.
I have not done it before.	Non ante feci.
Certainly this is possible.	Certe hoc fieri potest.
She told him nothing.	Nihil ei non indicavit.
Home again, now.	Domum iterum, nunc.
The man who thinks before.	Vir qui cogitat ante.
I could not understand.	Non potui intelligere.
if you like one.	si placet unum.
He is my father.	Pater meus est.
That's a lot of fun for you.	Ut sit amet aliquam enim.
If he wanted to.	Si vellet.
And he thinks.	Et cogitat.
And so she is ready to help.	Et sic non est paratus ad auxilium.
You can't do this.	Hoc facere non potes.
You just exist.	Vos iustus est.
He thought you.	Putabat te.
It seems like this.	Videtur sic.
He wanted to understand, and could not.	Intelligere voluit, et non potuit.
got on the road.	Obtinuit iter.
But it is not either.	Sed non est vel.
We need this for a long time.	Hoc diu nobis opus est.
There's a lot to say about me.	Non multum est de me dicere.
I'm not trying to do that.	Non me facere conatur.
It was done.	Fuit factum.
We did not see.	Nos non vidit.
You have a dog, that's really the thing.	Canem habes, vere hoc res est.
This has to be here, this has to be there.	Hoc habet hic esse, hoc habet ibi esse.
He did what he did in order to win.	Fecit quod fecit ut faceret vincere.
No one should go through something like that.	Nemo debet ire per aliquid simile.
She just didn't understand.	Illa iustus non intellexit.
But the money.	Sed pecuniam.
Even if only one time.	Etiam quis tempus nisi.
And see why.	Et vide quare.
I will not be ready.	Non erit paratus.
Man.	Vir.
You can give it to me.	Mihi dare potes.
and it was one thing for me.	unum et factum est mihi.
we have years.	annos habemus.
Now you know why.	Nunc cur scis.
It was last week.	Septimana eius fuit.
I thought through what was happening.	Cogitavi per id quod factum est.
And he knew how much.	Sciebat autem et quantum.
That is the best case.	Quod optime se habet.
Now there is something.	Nunc aliquid est.
It looks good.	Bonum videtur.
He was always in me.	In me semper erat.
Yes, please.	Etiam, velit.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
I hope tomorrow will be a better day.	Spero melius cras fore diem.
I want us to win.	nos vincere volo.
Today was for me.	Hodie mihi erat.
Not sure if something went wrong.	Non certus si aliquid mali abiit.
That was or not.	Id vel non erat.
No as it was now.	Nulla ut nunc erat.
All this for only a year.	Totum hoc solum anno.
I hope they can help you.	Spero te adiuvare posse.
He could not say this.	Hoc dicere non potuit.
I had to know.	Scire habui.
Now you can't give.	Nunc dare non potes.
He ought not to give it.	Non debet ei dare.
It's time to love yourself.	Aliquam sit amet nulla ipsum.
And you know which one.	Et scis quod unum.
He did not say this.	Non hoc dixit.
Tomorrow or some save.	Cras vel aliquam nisi.
That's how you do it.	Id quomodo facias.
I believe you.	Tibi credo.
He knew he could not believe it.	Sciebat se non credere.
But this is not as is.	Sed hic non est ut, est.
It was similar.	Similis erat.
But it was a great question.	Sed magna quaestio erat.
And it was true.	Et verum fuit.
I hope it doesn't.	Spero non facit.
I can't do anything.	Non possum me facere quicquam.
There is nothing else.	Non est aliud.
Day to day	Die ad diem.
It was in New Orleans.	Aliquam in erat erat.
I like to do some more than that.	Ut non aliquam quam.
He can't leave without them.	Sine illa relinquere non potest.
Play video.	Video ludere.
Don't say anything.	Noli dicere.
I could stay at home.	domi manere potui.
This is, you do not.	Hoc est, non facis.
Nobody.	Nemo.
Get what you want.	Id quod vis.
But it is nothing.	Sed nihil est.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
Not so bad.	Non ita malum.
Do the test beforehand.	Facere amet ante quam.
It would be okay to think.	Esset bene cogitare.
Not from you.	Non ex te.
That's one for you.	Id unum tibi.
You can't stop me.	Non potes me prohibere.
He did it the next year.	Proximo anno id fecit.
It can't be enough.	Satis non potest.
This is what	Hoc est quod.
I call him.	Eum ego.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
When this is so.	Quod cum ita sit.
and he has friends.	et amicos habet.
Not yet.	Nondum.
This is totally different.	Hoc est prorsus aliud.
This is not really true.	Hoc non est vere verum.
My advice.	Meum consilium.
but only if he does.	sed modo si facit.
I really like this job.	Ego vere amo hoc officium.
Who was his.	Eius erat quis.
This seems to be the best way.	Optime videtur hoc modo.
Don't do anything with it.	Ne quid cum illo.
It is so important.	Ita magna est.
I don't know why this happened.	nescio cur id acciderit.
He who knows himself has left and who does not.	Qui scit se reliquit et qui non facit.
but the name of it.	Nomen ei, sed.
No she's not home.	Nulla non est domi.
Now is not the time.	Nunc tempus non est.
The name is	Nomen est.
That's where it was.	Id ubi fuit.
I have seen too much.	Nimium vidi.
Nothing else is better than this.	Aliud melius quam hoc.
I am a man, you know.	Homo sum, tu scis.
That's not good for me.	Sic mihi non bene.
As he said.	Sicut dixit.
Well, it was time to go to work.	Bene, tempus erat ire ad opus suum.
I don't want to stay.	Nolo manere.
And you can't have it.	Et non potes id habere.
Maybe even scared.	Fortasse vel vix.
And this one.	Hoc autem unum.
There will be but not seen.	Ibi erit sed non videtur.
Good to see this.	Bene hoc videre.
It could not be done, however.	Fieri non potuit, sed.
You don't do that.	Quod ne facias, ut.
Well, I like this.	Bene, hoc mihi placet.
Maybe it's better.	Fortasse melius est.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
This could not be true.	Hoc verum esse non potuit.
Certainly not wanted.	Non certe voluit.
I'm sorry for that.	Paenitet enim.
Well done.	Bene fecit.
But it was good.	Sed bonum erat.
He does good.	Bonum facit.
I can only talk with you.	Non possum dicere modo cum.
And this soon.	Et hoc mox.
I know nothing, but yet.	Nihil scio, sed tamen.
i can be anything.	esse aliquid possum.
Certainly not tonight.	Certe hac nocte non est.
It was too good to go.	Erat etiam bonum ut.
Well better than nothing.	Bene melius quam nihil.
To sit now.	Ut sit nunc.
I want you to do this for me.	Volo enim vos hoc facere pro me.
You can see.	Videre potes.
You.	Tu.
This was actually done.	Hoc vere factum est.
I said not to be.	Dixi non esse.
May you be well.	Sit tibi bene.
No one is what you are to me.	Nemo est quod tu mihi.
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
I did not know what he meant.	non sciebam quid vellet.
I just do it and do it.	Modo facere et id.
And it is good.	Et bonum est.
All good things to me.	Omnia mihi bona.
That was not true.	Quod non erat verum.
I'm glad that you did.	Gaudeo quod fecisti.
It could be anything or anyone, and it is behind me.	Posset esse aliquid vel quis, et sit post me.
He had a wife.	Uxorem habuit.
He too.	Ipse etiam.
Nothing is even better, probably.	Nihil quidem melius, probabiliter.
But it is better than nothing.	Sed melius est quam nihil.
Even in some but	Etiam in aliquam nisi.
I hope you got this one.	Spero autem quod unum obtinuit.
That's how he came here.	Id quomodo huc venit.
He comes to me soon.	Is mox ad me venit.
Not after	Non post .
It seemed to go on and on.	Videbatur ire et in.
I have done it by myself.	per me ipsum feci.
I do not love you.	Non amo te.
I love him too.	Ego eum quoque.
I knew it.	Sciebam eam.
And again who knows.	Et iterum qui novit.
I see mine.	Meum video.
A guy like this has never been with me.	A guy sic numquam mecum fuit.
it was too late to do something about it.	Sero erat ad faciendum aliquid de eo.
he asked if he could come.	quaesivit si posset venire.
if this is possible.	si hoc fieri potest.
It was even before.	Etiam vel ante erat.
Things could not have been better.	Res melius esse non potuit.
Even more than this.	Etiam hac quam.
He has to decide whether he wants it or not.	Habet utrum velit necne.
This was what he did.	Hoc erat quod fecit.
You don't even need to think about this.	Tu ne hoc quidem debes cogitare.
It was an easy decision.	Facile consilium fuit.
You know me.	Scis me.
That's who he was now.	Ut quis nunc erat.
I can certainly understand why he loves you.	Cur te amet, certe intelligere possum.
She has to tell me what to do.	Habet narrare quid faciam.
I've done it.	Ego feci.
More than I did.	Plus quam feci.
The future is the time to come.	Futurum est tempus futurum.
It is difficult to say the truth.	Difficile est vere dicere.
could remain.	manere posset.
This he did to me.	Hoc mihi fecit.
You know, we do a lot of good.	Scis nos multum bene facere.
You think he wants to see you.	Putas te videre velle.
Nothing is like this.	Hoc nihil est simile.
Nothing has been done.	Nihil factum est.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
But you are right.	Sed tu recte.
You have to love yourself.	Habes ad ipsum.
But that is not the case.	Sed id ipsum non est.
It's not just about you.	Hoc non est solum de te.
If he could do that.	Quod si facere potuit.
That is.	Id est.
He knows and knows.	Scit, et scit.
I am just happy to be there.	Ego iustus felix ibi esse.
Or perhaps.	Vel fortasse.
probably not about that.	Non ut probabiliter.
To be honest it was great.	Ut sit amet magna erat.
He is speaking.	Loquitur.
It was him himself.	Eum ipsum erat.
You don't think it's good.	Bonum esse non putas.
You don't really know.	Rem non scis.
That was all possible.	Id erat omnia posse.
Enough to speak this already.	Jam satis hoc loqui.
I'm not sure what you mean.	Quid sibi velit non sum certus.
I would be interested in doing so.	Ut sit amet ex id.
I don't know sorry.	Nescio paenitet.
We don't think we're up to it.	Non puto nos ad eam sumus.
Or with us.	Vel nobiscum.
People do a lot.	Facere multum homines.
He said so.	Dixit ita.
I can't say why now.	Quare nunc non possum dicere.
I need it.	Mihi opus est.
I feel so much better.	Multo melius sentio.
I don't think much.	Non multum puto.
We can't have it now.	Id nunc habere non possumus.
No, it is not yet.	Non, adhuc non est.
by both.	per utrumque.
Not so much.	Non tantum.
He could not do it right now.	Iam recte facere non potuit.
Tom thought.	Tom, putavit.
It was some or something.	Aliquam vel aliquam erat.
And he did it for a while.	Et fecit etiam ad tempus.
Well, maybe now.	Bene, fortasse iam nunc.
Now as has been said.	Nunc ut dictum est.
I want a wife.	Uxorem volo.
It was certain that he had done it.	Certum erat se id fecisse.
Nothing could have been done.	Nihil fieri potuit.
I always wanted to go.	Ire semper volui.
You are not my husband.	Vir meus non es.
I did mine that day.	Meum feci eo die.
But nothing for this.	Sed nihil ad hoc.
I will do the same soon.	Idem ego mox.
But he wanted to go home.	Sed domum ire voluit.
Always, always, who was, was.	Semper, semper, erat quis, erat.
He could not say anything.	Non posset aliquid dicere.
Let me cum.	Fac me cum.
And not some.	Nec aliquam.
You don't have anything else.	Non habes aliquid aliud.
Today perhaps not so.	Hodie fortasse non ita est.
All at that time.	Omnes illo tempore.
As, you know.	Ut, scis.
Yep, now.	Vidi, nunc.
There is no job.	Non est officium.
This is the question.	Quaestio haec est.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
It is still getting on its way.	Questus adhuc suo modo.
I would like to.	Vellem.
Between you and me.	Inter me et te.
Someone is talking to me.	Aliquis mecum loquitur.
But today was not the day.	Sed hodie non fuit dies.
Without her you are nothing.	Sine illa nihil es.
This was nothing.	Hoc nihil erat.
Certainly to me.	Mihi certe.
We have the future.	Futurum habemus.
That's what's next.	Id quod in proximo est.
It's his.	Suus.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
That's all.	Totum id.
I believe it can be done.	fieri posse credo.
i can do some more.	possum facere aliquid amplius.
Who did it.	Qui fecit.
It is good, man.	Bonum est, homo.
You only know.	Tu modo scis.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
You are the only one who can trust us.	Tu solus es qui nos credere possumus.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
However.	Autem.
This post is fine.	Post hoc bene est.
As stated above.	Ut dictum est.
But these are not so.	Sed haec non ita sunt.
Not what he says.	Non quod dicit.
She will be scared.	Vix illa erit.
To say something.	Ad aliquid est.
This will not be easy.	Hoc non facile erit.
Nothing comes to mind.	Nihil occurrit.
But not today.	Sed non hodie.
You don't.	Non facis.
I can't do this at all.	Hoc omnino facere non possum.
Someone gave it to me.	Aliquis id mihi dedit.
Not sure if this is something.	Non certe si hoc res.
I will probably never see her home again.	Et verisimile non est videre eam in domum suam iterum.
If you want something done correctly.	Si vis aliquid recte factum.
I just like it.	Modo ut sit id.
This is now possible.	Hoc nunc fieri potest.
I will do this.	Hoc faciam.
No, not right.	Non, non recte.
Not well.	Non bene.
Sure.	Certus.
I did it myself.	Ipse mihi feci.
No one should do it.	Nemo id faceret.
But that was the time.	Sed id tempus erat.
No but how great.	Nulla sed magna quam.
i can still see.	adhuc videre possum.
Attempts to speak can be seen.	Conatus loqui videri potest.
This is not possible, but it is true.	Hoc fieri non potest, sed est vere.
He can do this.	Hoc facere potest.
This is the only one.	Hoc est solum unum.
Who knows what's happened now.	Quis scit quid nunc acciderit.
Yes, please.	Ita, quaeso.
I really don't like it.	Hoc vere non placet.
For now it is not.	Nunc non est enim.
that is what is to come.	id est quod futurum est.
And there you are.	Et ibi es.
Now she has.	Nunc habet.
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
And he knew that he was coming in some way.	Et sciebat se aliquo modo venire.
It could still be true.	Posset tamen esse verum.
No but always out.	Nulla sed semper ex.
It is good to do all that it does.	Bonum est ad omnia quae facit.
I haven't seen you yet.	Non vidi te et.
That is mine.	Quod meum est eius.
Well that's me.	Bene id mihi.
He did not do enough.	Non satis fecit.
How he did not understand.	Quomodo non intellexit.
It is necessary to go.	Necesse est ire.
Either way this year.	Utrumque hoc anno.
Do evil.	Malum fac.
Don't stop anything.	Noli quicquam prohibere.
I feel very happy for him.	Sit amet sentio ei.
But that's what he wants.	Sed id quam velit.
But you.	Sed tu.
It's time to like us.	Aliquam nobis similis.
He never said it.	Numquam dixit.
Or there was that.	Vel erat ut.
This is not much.	Hoc non multum.
Maybe it was or was.	Aliquam vel erat erat.
But here's something better.	Sed hic melius aliquid.
I don't know about him.	Nescio de eo.
Who knows it can be done.	Qui scit fieri posse.
No, not again.	Non, non iterum.
This does not occur.	Hoc non occurrit.
You shouldn't talk now.	Nunc loqui non debes.
I did and I do.	feci et facio.
Which indeed is good.	Quod quidem est bonum.
Which now seems to be happening.	Quod nunc videtur fieri.
It's time for us to do so.	Aliquam id nobis.
Well with me.	Bene mecum.
But he has not.	Sed non habet.
never has.	numquam habet.
He is a good father.	Bonus pater est.
He said you know.	Dixit te scire.
Not too much.	Non nimis.
It's not what you have.	Non est quod habes.
Not even him.	Non vel illum.
You can't see, you barely think.	Videre non potes, vix cogitas.
how are you.	quam tu.
I don't know enough.	Non satis scio.
She has to go.	Ire habet.
I know you too well.	Novi te nimium bene.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
Very much indeed.	Valde quidem.
But he is not a man.	Verum non est homo.
There's not much else to good.	Non multum est ad aliud bonum.
yes to no ex.	Etiam ut nulla ex.
I hope we can learn it.	Utinam id scire possumus.
I don't mean to play at all.	Non vult omnino ludere.
I'm going to know why.	Eo ut scire cur.
He asked nothing.	Nihil quaesivit.
Hardly got it.	Ita vix obtinuit.
It's not so with me.	Mecum non ita est.
He does good work.	Bonum opus facit.
Now I could get it.	Nunc eam accipere potui.
To know for themselves.	Scire sibi.
So probably please.	Ita verisimiliter placet.
To-morrow it was said.	Cras id dictum est.
It's good to see.	Hoc bonum est videre.
He would.	Vellet.
This was what he never knew.	Hoc erat quod numquam sciebat.
but he went away.	sed abiit.
Yes, it was going to happen.	Ita erat, futurum.
It was not the first time.	Primum non esset.
But not great.	Sed non magna.
I am at home.	Domi ego sum.
I was on the road.	Iter eram.
But as stated above.	Sed ut dictum est.
Don't let anyone choose.	Ne quis velit.
Get somebody out of that.	Ut quis ex quam.
You'll never know when you need it.	Numquam scire debes, cum tibi opus sit.
It will not be so bad.	Quod non erit tam malum erit.
I did well in school.	Bene in schola feci.
There will be no time like this.	Sic tempus non erit.
He did not say correctly.	Non recte dixit.
I don't know how to deal with it.	Nescio quomodo agere.
That's not up to your room.	Quod non est usque ad cubiculum tuum.
Can't do this again.	Hoc iterum facere non potest.
i never thought it would happen to you.	numquam te putavi futurum.
No one wanted to make money.	Nemo pecuniam facere voluit.
We both got it.	Nos ambo obtinuit.
Not already.	Non iam.
It's not too late.	Sero non est.
What is? 	Quid est?
he says.	dicit.
And this is true.	Et hoc verum est.
But it was a great time.	Sed tempus magna erat.
All three.	Omnes tres.
He also loves it.	Etiam id amat.
Now I have a wife.	Nunc uxorem habeo.
Better for us all.	Melius nobis omnes.
And more of it.	Et plus ex illa.
She could leave now if she wanted.	Posset relinquere nunc, si vellet.
Unless someone does it.	Nisi quis id.
That's how to do it yourself.	Ut id quam ipsum.
I heard and heard.	Audivi et audivi.
I want to do better.	Melius facere volo.
He is not alone here.	Non hic solus est.
There was a dog, and he was with me in this.	Canis fuit, et fuit mecum in hoc.
That was enough.	Illa satis erat.
Nothing I can think of.	Nihil possum cogitare.
I can hardly see anything.	Vix quicquam videre possum.
But not even that.	Sed ne illud quidem.
But better than that.	Sed melius quam.
It's not going to happen.	Non futurum est.
It could only be me like I was you.	Potuit tantum me ut essem tibi.
Or a.	Vel a.
He could not say more.	Plus dicere se non potuit.
This is not exactly bad.	Hoc non est prorsus malum.
We're not getting through this.	Per hoc non questus sumus.
Too bad it's not.	Nimis non est malum.
This is really good.	Hoc est vere bonum.
I think you're still there.	Puto esse adhuc ibi.
Its almost similar.	Eius fere similis.
That is certain.	Quod certum est.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
No one here.	Hic, nemo.
Don't take too much time soon.	Noli nimium primum.
I can hear nothing.	Nihil possum audire.
There is no plan.	Non est consilium.
That is.	Illud est.
He did what he said.	Fecit quod dixit.
I can't believe	Non possum credere.
And apparently I am not doing it wrong.	Et videtur non male facere.
It was good to know.	Hoc erat bonum scire.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
You are	Tu es .
I don't know what's the name.	Nescio quid nomen.
I have heard this.	Hoc audivi.
Not for you.	Nec tibi.
You can't think.	Non potes cogitare.
It's something for me.	Est aliquid mecum.
You are all the same.	Vos omnes simul.
But that's only before.	Sed id nisi ante.
This was good and bad.	Hoc erat bonum et malum.
She never did.	Quae numquam fecit.
But it was only.	Sed non nisi erat.
And he does this well.	Hoc quoque bene facit.
We can talk to each other.	Inter se loqui possumus.
I believe you.	Tibi credo.
I don't know if I am right.	Nescio an recte.
And he has.	Et habet.
It would be better.	Melius esset.
but he himself.	sed ipse.
that's kind of it.	id genus hoc est.
i want to do it.	facere volo.
Maybe nothing.	Forsitan nihil.
we are very busy.	valde occupatus sumus.
That's not great.	Non magna id.
It is very well said.	Optime dictum est.
And I hope it will be better.	Et spero melius fore.
But as it was.	Sed ut erat.
Which does not do well.	Quod non bene facit.
He made money.	Pecuniam fecit.
He said to you.	Dixit tibi.
That is not the case now.	Quod iam non est.
He can't do very well tonight.	Non ipse hac nocte optime potest.
It looks good.	Non spectat bonum.
For it cannot be done.	Fieri enim non potest.
He has a name.	nomen habet.
I did not want him to come home.	Nolui eum domum venire.
You may not know exactly what you need.	Ne prorsus quid tibi opus sit scire potes.
Often, this is fun.	Saepe, amet quo.
This is enough.	Hoc satis est.
he is good in him.	bonus est in eo.
I don't think it's possible.	Non puto posse.
This was not.	Hoc non erat.
That was your first time.	Ut sit amet tempus erat.
I said yes.	Dixi etiam.
But that has nothing to do with you.	Sed id nihil ad te.
How can someone be	Quo modo sit aliquis.
I don't like it, but I can do it.	Non placet, sed facere potest.
I want to leave something behind.	Volo aliquid post relinquere.
She's going to do it.	Illa facturus est.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
It was like what happened.	Simile quid factum est.
It is not true.	Non est verum.
I would like to be satisfied.	Satis vellem.
They are there for you.	Ibi sunt tibi.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
Never and never.	Numquam et numquam.
I really like how you look.	Sum vere et vide quomodo placet.
Don't post today.	Non post hodie.
Now we can't say the truth.	Nunc verum dicere non possumus.
Too little too late.	Quoque paulo nimium sero.
Nothing new here.	Nihil hic novi.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
The matter will be so.	Ita res erit.
You are so sorry.	Paenitet me tam es.
Where the thing is.	Ubi res est.
Maybe he wants it.	Aliquam vel enim velit.
Play with it.	Ludere cum illo.
It was not done, it is evil.	Non sic factum est, id est malum.
Time.	Eo tempore.
You are with me.	Tu mecum es.
I don't know enough.	Non satis scio.
Something's going to happen.	Aliquid futurum est.
He did not know.	Nesciebat.
But we are better than we are now.	Sed melius quam nunc sumus.
We have a plan.	Consilium habemus.
Not much.	Non multum.
i thought everything was going well.	Putabam omnia bene.
But it was not him.	Sed non erat ipsum.
It was like what happened today.	Simile erat quod hodie factum est.
That's his thing.	Id eius rem.
No one comes to you.	Nemo venit ad vos.
All are well.	Bene omnia sunt.
That's one thing.	Id unum est.
Only here and here and now.	Tantum hic et hic et nunc.
I had enough.	satis habui.
The things which he did, and the things which he did not.	Quae fecit, et quae non fecit.
I was not sure what, but it was true.	Non certus eram quid, sed verum erat.
We are both the same.	Idem ambo sumus.
No one from her.	Nemo eam a.
Get her there, but you can't.	Habere eam ibi, sed non potes.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
I wanted nothing to do.	Ego nihil volui facere.
But not from this.	Sed non ex hoc.
You do not want.	Non vis.
Never regret.	Numquam paenitet.
It was not for him.	Non erat ei.
I met a lot in this job.	Multum mihi occurrit in hoc officium.
He didn't want to think about it.	Noluit cogitare de illo.
You can't have both!	Utrumque habere non potes!.
He did what he could.	Fecit quod potuit.
as I told you.	sicut dixi tibi.
He saw her.	Vidit eam.
Was.	Esset.
But she never did.	Quae numquam sed.
He wants to talk to you.	Loqui tecum vult.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
This was not his plan.	Hoc consilium eius non fuit.
i feel so good.	ut bene sentio.
I have an affair with him.	rem cum illo habeo.
So it was for him.	Sic erat ei.
It is the same.	Simile est hoc.
? 	?
therefore we cannot say.	quare non possumus dicere.
We don't have a lot of time.	Non multum temporis habemus.
But who is none other than that.	Sed quis nulla quam.
It is not done now.	Non nunc factum est.
But only	Sed solum.
There was nothing there.	Nihil ibi fuit.
he had at home.	domi habuit.
He does not know you well.	Non te bene novit.
I will tell you.	Dicam tibi.
He knows you're not up to it.	Novit te ad eam non esse.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
How much you mean to me.	Quantum vis ad me.
But there are also.	Sed et sunt.
I think both.	Utrumque puto.
But what was that.	Sed quid erat id.
he never understood how he could do it.	numquam quomodo id facere posset intellexit.
I love you too.	Amo etiam.
I think nothing is good for you.	nihil te bonum puto.
I looked after you.	Vidi post te.
For all three of us.	Omnes enim nos tres.
He loves you very much.	Te valde amat.
I will do this somehow.	Ego hoc faciam aliquo modo.
How about him?	Quomodo de illo?.
Nothing new.	Nihil novi.
There is also another.	Est etiam aliud.
We are too much.	Nimium sumus.
This is in me.	Haec in me est.
This is evil.	Hoc malum est.
Certainly he would not.	Noluit certe.
He really has to do better.	Ille vere melius habet facere.
Maybe it's not him.	Aliquam non ipsum est.
He knew also that it was his own.	Sciebat quoque suum esse.
This is not quite true.	Hoc non est satis verum.
Not long.	Non diu.
I can see you again now.	Iterum videre possum, nunc.
I never really wanted.	Numquam me vere voluit.
Nothing, however.	Nihil tamen.
Help me do better.	Auxilium fac melius.
it was what it was.	erat quae fuit.
These are mine.	Haec mea sunt.
But that's not without.	Sed id non sine.
I don't surprise you.	Non miror te.
Got to have a plan.	Habere consilium obtinuit.
That person is not just me.	Ille homo iustus non est me.
Not bad, but.	Non male, sed.
And he was there.	Erat autem ibi.
Now that was something.	Nunc id erat aliquid.
I'm such a happy person.	Im tam felix homo.
All this I can understand.	Hoc totum intelligere possum.
And here it is.	Hic quoque est.
But I beg you this.	Sed quaeso hoc.
As he said himself.	Sicut dixit se.
You want to be yourself.	Tu vis esse tibi.
It's time and time.	Aliquam et tempus est.
Maybe he didn't.	Fortasse non fecit.
I did it again.	Iterum id feci.
I hope it will work later.	Post hoc opus erit spero.
Well that's probably what it was.	Et bene id quod verisimile erat.
Well, no, it's not enough.	Bene, non, non satis verum est.
Well I am certain.	Bene certum habeo.
But that is before.	Sed id est ante.
I didn't do it well to hear.	Non faceret eam bene audire.
Something very certain.	Aliquid admodum certum.
He was late for work.	Nuper opus erat.
This was easy for me.	Hoc mihi facile fuit.
He did something, but not for me.	Aliquid fecit, sed non mihi.
This guy was single.	Hoc erat unum guy.
now it is certain for me.	nunc certum mihi est.
I have seen nothing.	Nihil vidi.
to do, to do.	facere, facere.
I think you ought to have.	Puto debere habere.
Now	Nunc .
Not that either.	Non id vel.
It is his own.	Suum est.
It was too big for him.	Nimis magna ei fuit.
And they are not.	Et non sunt.
He refused to leave her.	Noluit eam relinquere.
I don't even know your name.	Ne nomen quidem novi.
I really can't help you.	Ego vere non possum te.
stop me from him.	ei me prohibere.
Next week is pretty soon.	Proxima septimana satis cito est.
So it was in me.	Sic erat in me.
Getting there.	Questus est.
Maybe it was.	Aliquam erat.
If enough of you are.	Si satis de te sunt.
I need to think about this.	de hoc mihi opus est cogitare.
But you did not make a decision by yourself.	Sed non per te consilium fecisti.
I don't even know your name.	Ne nomen quidem novi.
He does so.	Ita facit.
You can't do evil.	Malum non potes.
But it's not so late.	Sed non tam sero.
This work is for you more than you.	Hoc opus est tibi quam tibi.
But probably not.	Sed verisimile non est.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
He saw too much, at the same time, not enough.	Vidit nimium, simul, non satis.
I really don't want to talk.	Ego vere loqui non vis.
I need to see.	Mihi opus est videre.
Quickly, I beg you.	Cito, quaeso.
There is never more.	Numquam est amplius.
It would be enough.	Satis esset.
Look for fun or something.	Vide amet vel aliquid.
No one wants to be in the game.	Nulla in velit velit.
You did what you did to you.	Fecisti quod tibi fecisti.
There was.	Fuit.
It was really good to see her.	Vere bonum esset videre eam.
Now, I hope that doesn't come.	Nunc, quod spero non venit.
I have you.	Habeo te.
But he is still with us.	Sed adhuc nobiscum est.
That's what you want to say.	Id quod vis dicere.
But only to you.	Sed solum ad te.
It's time to get some out.	Aliquam et aliquam ex.
That's pretty easy.	Id satis facile.
But yes, there was more than that.	Etiam sed erat quam.
It was almost like this.	Sic erat hoc fere.
It is necessary to stop.	Necesse est prohibere.
I knew it was good.	Sciebam bonum esse.
We need this.	Hoc nobis opus est.
I just didn't die that day.	Modo non illo die.
We are here.	Hic sumus.
I didn't say anything.	Non dixi aliquid.
I just want to see how it is.	Modo videre quomodo sit .
Now who was out.	Nunc quis ex erat.
This was hard to say.	Hic difficile erat dicere.
It used to be okay, not now.	Quod bene esse solebat, non iam est.
It does not have.	Is non habet.
None on any front.	Nulla in aliquam ante.
I will say this first.	Id primum dicam.
That was ready.	Quod paratus erat.
i have a job.	officium habeo.
I don't want you ever to leave.	Nolo te umquam relinquere.
But I got it.	Sed obtinuit ut.
You have to do it.	Facere tibi eum.
I need it as well.	Opus est ut bene.
This is one way to stop.	Hoc est unum iter prohibere.
You can't believe what he says.	Non potes credere quod dicit.
You still don't.	Tu tamen non facis.
But not in this.	Sed non in hac.
It's really good.	Est vere bonum.
it was behind me.	post me fuit.
But it was not him.	Sed non erat ipsum.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
It can be really good.	Vere bonum potest esse.
They were both very pleased.	Ambo admodum.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
Yes, but there is some.	Etiam sed aliquam est.
This is similar to this.	Hoc simile et hoc.
It's really, really good to see.	Est vere, vere bonum videre.
This was not going to happen.	Hoc non erat futurum.
This is the same for me.	Hoc idem mihi.
I don't want you through it.	Nolo te per illum.
I have this now.	Modo hoc habeo .
There was no such thing.	Nulla res erat.
That's how it is.	Ut id est quam.
what will be after him.	quid post se futurum sit.
That's how it's done.	Id quomodo factum est.
He was there.	Erat ibi.
Too quickly, just too quickly.	Nimis cito, modo nimis cito.
He ought to go.	Ire debet.
He was just like that dog.	Erat illo modo canis similis.
We can't say nothing.	Non possumus dicere nihil.
I just want to do it.	Ego iustus volo facere.
Probably didn't know what else to say.	Probabiliter quid aliud dicere nesciebat.
You are not one.	Non unum.
we have time.	tempus habemus.
There is no id.	Nulla id.
I am so very sorry.	Ita sum valde.
John was not there.	Ioannes non erat ibi.
That's what it is.	Id quod est.
Now, you're on a date.	Nunc, in diem es.
I like saying a lot.	Placet dictum sit amet.
I thought that's what I wanted.	Putavi id quod voluit.
But this was at home.	Sed hoc erat domi.
It is also very likely.	Verisimile etiam est.
I want to see you.	Volo te videre.
We can go through this together.	Per hoc simul ire possumus.
It will be fine.	Bene erit.
he did not know what it was.	nesciebat quid esset.
may not always exist.	Ut non semper est.
To not save yourself.	Ut non nisi ipsum.
What do you think.	Quid cogitas.
It was never necessary.	Numquam necesse fuit.
I want to get something.	Volo aliquid accipere.
But the matter was.	Sed res erat.
But no one knew much.	Sed nemo multa scivit.
This is the time.	Hic tempus est.
No one could stay in school for more than three years.	Nemo plus quam tres annos in schola manere potuit.
There is only one.	Unus est tantum.
I just don't want to.	Ut non velit.
You'll never know when you need it.	Numquam scire debes, cum tibi opus sit.
Yes you are right.	Ita recte.
There is none here.	Hic, nulla est.
Is there something similar?	estne aliquid simile.
He did it by himself.	Per se id fecit.
He knew, but didn't like it.	Scivit, sed non placet.
could not find.	Non potuit invenire.
never do.	numquam facere.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
He said that he could get some money.	Dixit posse esse aliquam pecuniam.
Which he did	Quam fecit .
Always do something.	Semper aliquid facere.
This is not going to happen.	Hoc non futurum est.
I said yes.	Etiam id dixi.
you have some.	Habesne.
But this cannot be rightly done.	Sed id recte fieri non potest.
At the same time.	Simul.
And he did well.	Et bene fecit.
You can't do this.	Hoc facere non potes.
I can see it, and I can see it.	Videre eam, et me videre potest.
Say something.	Dic aliquid.
He comes after her.	Venit post eam.
For how long I was, he could not say where he was.	Quam diu eram, ubi esset, dicere non potuit.
Your time is not now.	Tuum tempus non nunc est.
This means a lot to me!	Hoc est multum mihi!.
He did not.	Non fecit.
I do not love you.	Non amo te.
I want you too.	Vobis quoque volo.
Soon he could not see her.	Mox eam non videre potuit.
So you have a plan.	Ita habes consilium.
It is good.	Bonum est.
I hope all is well.	Spero omnes bene.
I don't think so some of the time.	Non puto aliquid temporis.
sorry not to.	Paenitet non est.
I couldn't believe it enough.	Non potui satis credere.
may not always be zero.	Ut non semper nulla.
So sorry this happened.	Ita me paenitet hoc factum.
never get that.	numquam ut quam.
just as he can.	sicut potest.
I wonder what this is.	Miror quid hoc sit.
You can only go so hard for so long.	Tantum potes tam difficile ire tam diu.
But this is it.	Sed hoc est.
which I thought it was.	quam id putavi fuisse.
Someone says something important.	Aliquis magna aliquid dicit.
I am the only one person.	unus solus ego sum homo.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
I said perhaps.	Dixi fortasse.
Now tell me.	Nunc autem dic mihi.
He's ready.	Ille paratus sum.
This advice is good.	Hoc consilium bonum est.
We have to play better.	Melius habemus ludere.
But he was unwilling to do it.	Sed id facere nolebat.
I don't know you.	Non novi te.
He was also in him.	Etiam in ipsum erat.
I am still alive.	adhuc sum.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
But that is already true.	Sed id iam verum est.
It's pretty easy.	Satis facile factum est.
if you have a job.	si habere officium.
I hope to see you next year.	Spero te videre proximo anno.
He probably should.	Probabiliter debet.
I could never do it without him.	Numquam potuit sine illo facere.
I need something else.	Aliud mihi opus est.
Take a look at the guy behind this thing.	Vide in guy post hanc rem.
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
This will be easy.	Hoc facile erit.
Very, very good.	Valde, valde bonum.
he did not know where he was or what he was;	nesciebat, ubi esset, vel quid esset;
By this it is necessary to speak.	Per hoc loqui necesse est.
You can do it if you want.	Facere potes si vis.
That's how it is.	Ut id quam est.
But he doesn't want us either.	Sed vel nobis non velit.
He thinks this is good.	Hoc bonum esse putat.
Maybe that was great.	Aliquam id magna erat.
No you don't have any.	Nulla non aliquam est.
And I've seen some like him.	Et ut ipsum aliquam vidi.
He never wanted to do it again.	Numquam iterum id facere voluit.
There's a lot to know.	Non multum est scire.
This certainly should.	Hoc certe debet.
Don't get anywhere with me.	Non ut huc ad me.
He could do everything.	Omnia facere potuit.
I'm sure it's not hard to find one there.	Certus sum non difficile invenire unum ibi.
I can't see you today.	Te hodie videre non potest .
But he does well.	Sed bene facit.
He is a good man who knows his job.	Bonus est vir qui suum officium novit.
He does better and better.	Melius et melius facit.
More than you've been there.	Plus quam tu ibi.
I don't even know why.	Nescio quidem cur.
I knew nothing.	Nihil sciebam.
Your family never does.	Tuum genus numquam facit.
Nothing to you at the moment.	Nihil ad te in tempore.
I wish for a while.	Utinam ad tempus.
It was a bad thing.	Malum erat.
I didn't want to do this alone.	Hoc solum nolui facere.
It's gonna be fun.	Est amet amet.
It is not easy.	Non facile.
I will do it again.	Iterum faciam.
I was still everything.	Fui etiam omnia.
You're a good boy, right.	Bonus puer es, recte.
He quickly did it.	Cito fecit.
There is always that much question.	Semper ut multum quaestio est.
There is no name.	Non est nomen.
The plan seems to be working.	Consilium opus esse videtur.
He was not prepared for that.	Erat paratus qui.
Looks like you're in.	Similis es in.
Not tomorrow, not next week, but today.	Non cras, non proxima septimana, sed hodie.
Now not.	Nunc non.
This is for us all.	Hoc pro nobis omnibus.
Both are good.	Utrumque bonum est.
My teacher did it too.	Meus quoque magister fecit.
Nothing was said in it.	Nulla in dictum erat.
It was a really hard time for me.	Vere difficile tempus mihi fuit.
I truly am.	Ego vere sum.
I suspect this has been done.	Suspicor hoc factum esse.
Do a lot better than that.	Facere amet melius quam.
You can do everything right and still be done.	Potes omnia recte facere et adhuc fieri.
I think one thing to live here.	Puto unum hic vivere.
Everything you need to know.	Omnia scire opus est.
With what .	Cum quod .
me night by night.	me nocte nocte.
must be done.	Faciendum est.
It has not been difficult.	Non fuit difficile.
Now was not the time.	Nunc nec tempus erat.
One and only.	Unus et solus.
Now he was always there.	Nunc in semper erat.
they are with me.	mecum sunt.
I can't believe	Non possum credere.
There is no one like yourself.	Nulla quis ut ipsum.
And you too can.	Et tu etiam potes.
He was this man.	Erat hic vir.
I saw him yesterday.	eum heri vidi.
I don't want a job.	Nolo officium.
I don't really know what to say.	Non vere scio quid dicam.
We must always do it all.	Omnes nos semper faciendum est.
There was nothing here.	Hic, nihil erat.
Now it's a great idea.	Nunc a est magna.
I wonder what you want to do.	Miror quid vis facere.
Is it you?	Estne tu?.
No one says this.	Nulla quis dicit id.
It looks good to me.	Non vultus bonus est mihi.
And he knew that he would do it.	Et sciebat se id facturum esse.
But it was a difficult time.	Sed erat tempus difficile.
Which indeed was not true.	Quod quidem verum non erat.
This he does thus.	Hoc sic facit.
Now it was easy to see through him.	Nunc per ipsum videre facile erat.
If you don't, who?.	Si non facis, quis ?.
Not too much, though.	Non nimium, sed.
It can only be good.	Bonum potest esse nisi.
And no what.	Et nulla id quod.
if indeed we.	si quidem nos.
Well done indeed.	Bene quidem factum.
It probably wasn't.	Probabile non erat.
I could still see.	adhuc videre potui.
You have lunch together.	Prandium simul habes.
Even he was not himself.	Etiam non erat ipsum.
She got it and still wanted it.	Illa obtinuit, et adhuc voluit.
He wanted to know.	Scire voluit.
It's just too loud.	Nimis magna modo est.
I know the truth.	verum novi.
He does not do well.	Non bene facit.
Don't stop.	Noli prohibere.
If he doesn't do a good job.	Si bonum officium non facit.
Man does well.	Bene facit homo.
His father did not.	Pater eius non fecit.
Who we are.	Qui sumus.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
I can do more for him.	Ego plus possum in eo.
Maybe you don't.	Fortasse non facis.
Work is at home, work is at home.	Domi opus est, domi opus est.
i'm pretty.	Sum satis.
What a great idea.	Magna quam.
That means a lot.	Id est multum.
But it is the same.	Sed sed ipsum.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
But there is no need.	Sed non opus est.
Now he would, if he would.	Iam vellet, si vellet.
I know you're saying this too.	Scio te id quoque dicere.
All had a great night with you.	Omnes magna nocte tecum.
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
Not everyone could do it.	Non omnes potuit.
No one could stop it.	Nemo eam prohibere potuit.
But how it was done.	Sed quomodo factum est.
No one will do it for you.	Nemo tibi facturus est.
And in and in, as stated above.	Et in et in, ut dictum est.
I'll tell you what it is.	Dicam quid sit.
I was ready.	paratus eram.
He got it through him.	Obtinuit eum per eum.
It is never enough.	Numquam satis.
That's not for him.	Quod non ei.
And you want even more.	Et plus etiam vis.
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
I know you.	Scio te.
Plus, soon.	Plus, cito.
In this way something has been done.	Hoc modo aliquid factum est.
That's perhaps up to now.	Id est fortasse usque nunc.
You can't go.	Ire non potes.
You owe me great things.	Magna mihi debes.
He says nothing more.	Nihil amplius dicit.
And he devoured him.	Et comedit eum.
It was a lot, it was a lot.	Multum erat, multum erat.
We can do nothing.	Nihil possumus.
If this is, I don't know.	Hoc si est, nescio.
How well it is for you.	Ut bene sit tibi.
He spoke thus.	Sic dixit.
I told him not.	Non dixi ei.
And to do that.	Et facere qui.
Please advise please.	Placet quaeso consilium.
I feel very sorry for this.	Valde hoc sentio.
I hope we will never again.	Spero nos numquam iterum.
Certainly not.	Certe non.
He can see.	Videre potest.
I would do this.	Hoc facerem.
It's something that you don't need to do.	Est aliquid, quod facere non debes.
This was enough time.	Hoc satis tempus fuit.
But neither was he from.	Sed nec erat ex.
There indeed.	Ibi quidem.
To do it yourself.	Ut faceret te.
It was where he wanted to be now.	Erat ubi nunc esse voluit.
You mean too much.	Vis nimis.
It was said not to do.	Dictum est non facere.
Well, he didn't.	Bene, non faceret.
I never told you this.	Numquam tibi hoc dixi.
I love how it looks right now.	Quam nunc spectat amo.
He is a good father.	Bonus pater.
Not much here.	Non multum hic.
see what you've got.	quod vide tu obtinuit.
when still not.	Cum tamen non.
My father was one.	Pater meus unus erat.
I want to do more than see.	Plus volo facere quam videre.
i'll do it now.	iam non faciam.
It's time to say the same thing.	Aliquam ut dictum ipsum.
No, not right.	Non, non recte.
He wanted all that he could by himself.	Omnia per se voluit quod potuit.
I know many things.	Scio multa.
Be there if you can.	Ibi si potes.
which I can see myself.	quod me ipsum videre possum.
You have to live this way.	Habes hoc modo vivere.
Only nothing.	Tantum nihil.
And it was.	Erat autem.
To get by or from.	Ut a nec ex.
It will be fine again.	Bene iterum erit.
We never do it.	Numquam id nobis.
Never say never.	Numquam numquam.
But this seems to have been done.	Sed hoc videtur esse factum.
But neither is the matter.	Sed nec rem.
I told myself this would also happen.	Dixi me hoc quoque futurum.
It is very likely now.	Verisimile nunc est.
So it is.	Ita est.
Look what you got.	Vide quid obtinuit.
That's what you want from yourself.	Id ipsum quod vis a.
This has just been said.	Hoc modo dictum est.
But this was difficult.	Sed hoc erat difficile.
I don't know what to do anymore.	Nescio quid amplius facere.
I had, to have.	Habui, habere.
But there is help.	Sed auxilium est.
This is very bad!!!	Hoc est valde malum!!!
You're not ready.	Non es paratus.
The facts are so.	Ita res sunt.
It will be so.	Sic erit.
I think you need to talk to someone.	Puto te loqui ad aliquem opus.
She is the only father she has ever known.	Solus est pater illa quae scivit.
I hope that you like it.	Spero quod placet.
But not.	Sed non.
It does not please.	Non placet.
He will do it again.	Iterum facturus est.
He was unable to do this work.	Hoc opus facere non potuit.
It is good and evil.	Bonum est et malum.
Me too.	Me quoque.
I will say help.	Dicam, auxilium.
he made it happen.	fieri fecit.
They are both with us now.	Nunc ambo nobiscum sunt.
not even one.	ne unum quidem.
Now in .	Nunc in .
That's too much, indeed.	Nimium id quidem.
By the same token.	Per etiam ipse fuit.
it was not where he wanted to be.	non erat ubi esse voluit.
Do just what you want.	Fac modo quo vis.
This is not the same.	Idem hic non est.
This, however, is the case.	Hoc tamen ita se habet.
Well perhaps more than a little.	Bene fortasse plus quam parum.
How it looks?	Quomodo spectat?.
To know.	Scire.
This has been done and evil.	Hoc factum est et malum.
I know, she thought.	Scio, putavit.
But we have one.	Sed unum habemus.
It's still you.	Est adhuc te.
I haven't been there for a long time.	Non diu ibi fui.
I like doing it, not mine.	Placet facere, non meum.
He wanted to believe him so badly.	Tam male voluit ei credere.
There will be a journey.	Erit iter.
Never had another job.	Aliud officium nunquam habuit.
He likes her.	Velit eius.
Things could not have been better.	Res melius fieri non potuit.
Absolutely not enough said.	Omnino non satis dictum.
You know, don't even do this.	Scis, ne hoc quidem facias.
To tell the story again.	Narrare iterum.
I feel assured that it will be.	Certum habeo fore.
It was not as before.	Non erat ut ante.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
We need nothing.	Nihil nobis opus est.
This will be the same.	Hoc idem erit.
So it is.	Ita est.
This is just.	Hic est iustus.
I'm sorry I want to tell you both.	Paenitet me utrumque tibi dicere volo.
Time to say for sure.	Tempus certe dicam.
I have them all here.	Omnes hic habeo.
But generally not.	Sed fere non.
No one comes to her.	Nemo venit ad eam.
She thought everything would be right.	Recte putavit omnia fore.
It's too late now.	Sero nunc est.
Look at what's happened.	Vide quid acciderit.
The father does not have.	Pater non habet.
I could learn.	scire potui.
I can't do it again.	Iterum facere non possum.
We are men.	Nos homines sumus.
So that was now.	Ita nunc id esset.
i think whatever you want.	Puto quod vis.
It is good for him, though.	Bonum est ei, sed.
Maybe he can believe it again.	Forsitan potest iterum credere.
Not the first time.	Non primum.
never get out.	numquam ut ex.
But you did not.	Sed non fecisti.
I have it now.	Id nunc habeo.
Yes, you really can only do what you really can.	Ita, vere potes tantum facere quod vere potes.
I'm afraid you're right.	Vereor te recte.
But you are not yet.	Sed nondum es.
But he doesn't want him.	Sed non ipsum velit.
I can see it.	Possum videre illud.
I have nothing to do with me.	Non habeo quod mecum.
Don't think about it.	Noli cogitare de illo.
I like.	Mihi placet.
I'm really happy for you.	Im 'vere felix tibi.
Maybe that's the same thing.	Aliquam id ipsum est.
One thing is certain.	Unum certum est.
Better if not.	Melius si non.
It was not hard.	Non difficile erat.
I will say this.	Dicam hoc.
And perhaps	Et fortasse .
Tell him everything.	Dic ei omnia.
So perhaps you are.	Ita tu fortasse.
As it was now.	Ut nunc erat.
He can only come to know.	Scire venire potest nisi.
You have to overcome, and to overcome, and to overcome.	Vincere habes, et vincere, et vincere.
But it was not always.	Sed non semper erat.
But you are right.	Sed tu bene .
This is not true at all.	Hoc omnino non est verum.
How neither.	Quam nec.
I hope you've done it.	Spero te fecisse.
This was at home.	Hic erat domi.
But this seems to be doing more.	Hoc autem plus facere videtur.
We are not really.	Non vere sumus.
Maybe not even that.	Ne forte id quidem.
Never sit in order.	Numquam sit in ut.
Not even that.	Ne id quidem.
they are not one and the same.	non sunt unum et idem.
Maybe that was not what I did wrong.	Forsitan id quod mihi fecit malum non fuit.
It seemed very unlikely at the time.	Valde probabile videbatur tempore.
Everyone is trying to do their best.	Omnes se optime facere conatur.
And he does not love me.	Et me non amat.
It is bad enough to do.	Malum est satis facere.
I would not do this.	Hoc facere nolui.
He did not see me.	Ille me non vidit.
You left me.	Te mihi reliquit.
a.	a.
I just don't have.	Ut non habet.
This morning	Hoc mane .
Not well.	Non bene.
It makes you go.	Facit ire.
There is something else you have to do.	Est aliquid aliud tibi faciendum.
Now I can't speak.	Nunc loqui non possum.
Yes I said no.	Etiam non dictum nulla.
That was not today.	Quod hodie non fuit.
Which I could not do.	Quod facere non potui.
I do not see.	Non video.
But he was in him.	Sed in erat ipsum.
And this was always.	Et hoc semper fuit.
We can't see.	Non possumus videre.
i think both are his.	utrumque puto suum.
He was alone.	Solus esset.
Something can be found in it.	Aliquid possit in est.
I am in him.	In eo sum.
It was always, but never.	Semper erat, sed numquam.
Everything's up.	Omnia in usque.
Not even that way.	Non illo quidem modo.
yes or very nice.	Etiam vel ipsum nisi.
Which indeed is true.	Quod quidem verum est.
In a very important way.	In ipsum magna.
And yet this is what he will do.	Et tamen hoc est quod facturus est.
I want so much.	Tam multa volo.
I saw nothing else.	Nihil vidi aliud.
Evil and true.	Malum et verum.
You owe nothing.	Nihil debes.
This is the day that you've got through.	Haec est dies quam habes per.
But it will not be enough.	Sed non satis erit.
Not even one.	Ne unum quidem.
I have a house there.	Habeo ibi domum.
You'd better get it.	Melius velis accipere.
Here's what you have.	Hic est quod habes.
He likes to go to school.	Velit scholam.
You are here	Hic es .
It's who you are.	Is est qui es tu.
Not of all, but certainly of him.	Non de omnibus, sed de eo certe.
The situation is fine.	Bene res se habet.
I want to do everything.	Facere volo omnia.
It is probable.	Probabile est.
He was just.	Iustus erat .
I'll make one, but I don't know when.	Faciam unum, sed nescio quando.
It is entirely up to you that you are one.	Totum ad te ipsum quod unus es.
You don't.	Non facis.
Enough for me.	Ad me satis.
So here you are.	Sic hic es.
what's to be done.	Quid sibi faciendum sit.
No one should know.	Nemo scire debet.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
You're thinking of it.	Cogitare es ex eo.
She wanted, from her.	Voluit, ab illa.
That may be something for you.	Quod ut aliquid sit tibi.
I want to be a guy.	Volo esse guy.
But not him yet.	Sed non ipsum sed.
I think that's really something.	Puto quod vere aliquid.
He would not do this.	Hoc facere nolebat.
When you'd like.	Cum velis.
It's not okay.	Non bene esse.
what I could do now, you know.	quod nunc facere potui, scis.
He will be a good man if anything happens.	Vir bonus erit si quid acciderit.
Even at home all day.	Totum diem etiam domi.
He is the one who is.	Ipse est qui est.
But not so.	Sed non ita.
This is if you're lucky.	Hoc est, si felix es.
But rightly, as it seems.	Sed recte, ut videtur.
Tomorrow is not at all.	Cras non nulla.
And it is not at all.	Et omnino non est.
He did very well for quite a while.	Optime fecit ad tempus satis.
I hardly feel it.	vix sentio.
If to the point.	Si ad illud.
Maybe, something else.	Forsitan, aliud.
But from well.	Sed ex bene.
And certainly not thinking.	Et certe non cogitas.
However, he wanted to talk to someone.	Tamen voluit eum cum aliquo loqui.
Who said little, and did much.	Qui parum dixit, et multum fecit.
I really like him.	Ego vere similis ei.
He could not live by him.	Non potuit per illum vivere.
He didn't want me.	Noluit mihi.
We are not there.	Ibi non sumus.
But that is now.	Sed id est nunc.
To say.	Ut dicam.
It looks at me.	Non me spectat.
No one wants it.	Nulla id ipsum velit.
I can buy this.	Hoc emere possum.
It was unlikely to leave him after all.	Probabile fuit eum post omnes relinquere.
I don't feel it.	Ad eam non sentio.
What? 	Quod?
He asked about you.	Quaesivit de te.
I just want to say great.	EGO iustus volo dicere magna.
just getting on with it.	Iustus questus cum eo.
You don't have to stay alone.	Non solum ad te manere.
He saw great things.	Magna vidit.
And there was but none.	Sed et erat sed nulla.
Which always pleases me.	Quod semper placet.
In order for us to do so.	Ut nobis id.
I thought he was a dog.	Putavi eum canem esse.
For now I need it.	Nunc enim opus est.
He says one thing, he acts another.	Aliud dicit, aliud agit.
It almost looks like fun.	Fere similis eum amet.
It was definitely a good deal.	Certus erat per multum.
But as there was none.	Sed ut nulla erat.
It is good, not bad.	Bonum est, non malum.
There is no time for it.	Nulla id tempus ipsum.
and he went away.	et ille abiit.
You said enough already.	Satis iam dixisti.
He knows everything there to know.	Scit omnia ibi scire.
I love everything she does.	Amo omnia quae facit.
Or to be seen.	Vel videri.
I want to know.	Scire volo.
You know, not mine.	Scis, non me^us.
But yet it is nothing.	Sed tamen nihil est.
But not three.	Sed non tres.
But see to us.	Sed vide nobis.
I have nothing.	Habeo quod.
I hope this is not so.	Spero hoc non ita est.
It could very well have been done.	Optime potuit videri quod factum est.
I never used to be like this.	Numquam sic solebat.
That's never going to happen.	Id nunquam futurum est.
Unless there is something.	Nisi quid est.
This was necessary.	Hoc opus erat.
He came thither in the morning.	Mane illuc venit.
Not well.	Non bene.
Maybe it wasn't him.	Aliquam non ipsum erat.
It is good to have.	Bonum est habere.
This is where you want to be.	Hic est ubi vis.
This man of mine has done this.	Hoc fecit hic homo meus.
That either, that or either.	Id vel vel, id vel vel.
Or so he thought.	Vel sic putavit.
But the chariots	Sed currus .
There was not much to do.	Non multum ad id faciendum erat.
He does his job very well.	Suum officium optime facit.
It is done, it is done.	Factum est, factum est.
I know you want.	Scio te velle.
Maybe never before.	Aliquam numquam ante quam.
It is getting bad.	Malum questus est.
he got it all.	id totum obtinuit.
He can't do so much.	Tantum non potest.
I can't do this.	Hoc facere non possum.
Too bad she is at home.	Nimis domi est.
I think the same thing today.	Idem hodie puto.
No one could find him.	Nemo eum invenire potuit.
No more than that.	Nulla id quam quam.
But the journey was difficult.	Sed iter difficile erat.
Maybe you've never seen it before.	Aliquam id numquam ante.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
Now, really.	Modo, vere.
I always said yes.	Ita semper dixi.
I would not believe.	Nolui credere.
You can't do this work alone.	Hoc solum opus facere non potes.
I can't say for sure.	Pro certo dicere non possum.
You have a lot of years in yourself.	Multum annos habes in te.
It's late now.	Sero nunc.
He didn't want to look too much.	Noluit nimis nimis videri.
They are very right.	Recte admodum sunt.
He was going home now.	Nunc domum erat.
This is not something.	Hoc non est aliquid.
And it is difficult.	Et difficile est.
for I am indeed.	vere enim sum.
But not as it is.	Sed non ut sit.
he was ready.	paratus erat.
I guess you know how to do it.	Suspicor, scis quomodo id facias.
It is certain that he will do it for you too.	Certum est te etiam facturum esse.
He knew what he was.	Sciebat quod erat.
I thought something was wrong.	Aliquid mali putavi esse.
Not so always.	Non ita semper.
We can't just do it.	Nos non solum id facere.
I guess someone just forgot.	Suspicor aliquem modo oblitus es.
Yes, it was going to happen.	Ita erat, futurum.
It was still enough.	Satis tamen fuit.
I don't see much.	Non multum video.
It doesn't look so good.	Non est vultus bonus.
So I need help.	Sic opus est auxilio.
This is, he thought.	Hoc est, putabat.
He can do this very well.	Hoc optime potest.
I don't know yet today.	Nescio adhuc hodie.
you do not do well.	recte ne feceris.
Now for who that is.	Nunc enim quis ut est.
not from the nearest.	Non ex proximo.
We don't need to be here.	Non opus est nobis hic esse.
He could not believe it was done.	Credere non potuit factum.
This work is all I need.	Hoc opus est mihi opus est.
This really is not possible.	Hoc vere fieri non potest.
he was always a dog.	canis semper fuit.
But as always was.	Sed ut semper erat.
I'm not behind you.	non sum post te.
But it was still as it is.	Sed adhuc erat ut est.
There must be something else.	Aliud esse necesse est.
This one is correct.	Recte hoc unum.
I wanted him too.	eum quoque volui.
Not so at all.	Non ita omnino.
It has been almost a week now.	Fere septimana nunc fuit.
Or not talking at all.	Vel non loquitur omnino.
I could not think of this now.	Hoc nunc cogitare non potui.
The future looks good.	Futurum bonum spectat.
I just wasn't up to it, really.	Ego iustus ad eam non erat, vere.
And if he would .	Et si vellet .
That's likely to be possible.	Id fieri posse verisimile est.
You can play anything.	Ludere aliquid potes.
Nothing more than he could do now.	Nihil amplius quam iam facere potuit.
I don't want to talk or see.	Nolo loqui vel videre.
This was not what he wanted.	Hoc non erat quod voluit.
This is not possible.	Hoc modo fieri non potest.
I could not hear enough.	Satis audire non potui.
I will say nothing.	Nihil dicam.
It's all in you.	Totum in te.
Not that time yet.	Non id tempus sed.
He did not.	Non fecit.
I'm not sure how this will work.	Non sum certus quomodo hoc opus sit.
He was good to me.	Ille mihi bonus fuit.
But he could do nothing.	Sed nihil potuit.
That seems to take a long time.	Quod diu videtur.
It was time for some fun.	Aliquam sit amet tempus erat.
This was probably okay.	Probabile erat hic bene.
So we're here to help you.	Ita hic sumus ut te adiuvet.
There's nothing in it.	In ipsum nulla.
I no longer need it.	Mihi iam non opus est.
But he was there.	Sed ibi fuit.
I couldn't take it anymore.	Non potui amplius accipere.
That was all.	Id erat omnibus.
It's not time for him.	Etiam non tempus ipsum.
This could be good.	Posset hoc esse bonum.
He was also himself.	Etiam et ipsum erat.
He knew that this was evil.	Sciebat hoc malum esse.
And he was there.	Erat autem ibi.
He said sure.	Dixit certus.
None of that was any.	Nulla id aliquam erat.
Almost nothing you like.	Fere nihil vis.
Another decision was made.	Aliud consilium factum est.
That's what he did.	Id quod fecit.
Now I don't have time out.	Nunc non tempus ex.
Maybe it's not easy.	Non facile fortasse.
It was not done correctly.	Non recte factum.
I am not on this journey.	Hoc iter non sum.
But he could not leave yet.	Sed adhuc relinquere non potuit.
They are not here, they are not here.	Non sunt hic, non sunt hic.
Nothing was going to happen.	Nihil futurum erat.
That's what you are.	Id quod es.
Who could be here.	Posset quis hic.
You who you are.	Tu qui es.
I can't be seen!	Non possum non videri!.
Now he loves them all.	Nunc omnes amat.
and this is evil.	et hoc malum est.
I knew that too.	Sciebam id quoque.
I have never done this before.	Numquam ante id.
The problem seems too big.	Quaestio nimis magna videtur.
It will not be difficult.	Non difficile erit.
I do not think.	Non puto.
Yes, not how it was.	Etiam non quam erat.
Say now.	Dic nunc.
I like her.	similis sum eius.
At the proper time.	Suo tempore.
Good to know.	Bonum scire.
But yet it was now.	Sed sed nunc erat.
He also doesn't want none.	Etiam nec velit nulla.
There hasn't been anything wrong.	Ibi non habet aliquid mali.
He is the same.	Ipse est.
You can definitely do it.	De illo certo potes.
There is really nothing.	Est vere nihil.
It was OK for me that way.	Bene mihi fuit illo modo.
Without him there could not be.	Sine illo esse non posset.
I don't know about him.	De illo nescio.
"But we can't.	'Sed non possumus.
But I want more than this.	Volo tamen plus quam hoc.
It is certain.	Certum est.
That's the same thing he does.	Id ipsum facit.
Do you think I'm going to do it?	Putasne me facturum?.
Now it's in front.	Nunc in ante est.
I've never been so happy before.	Nunquam tam felix ante fui.
Still on video.	Adhuc ex video.
No one is talking to each other.	Nemo inter se loquitur.
I always want to be alone.	Solus semper volo.
We can find a lot of time.	Multum temporis invenire possumus.
You have something to do with it.	Habes de eo aliquid faciendum.
I can't do anything.	Non possum facere quicquam.
I want to do something else to get some ID.	Aliquid aliud facere volo ut aliquam id.
But from some rather than.	Sed a aliquam quam.
Truly, truly I am.	Vere, vere sum.
His wife	Suam uxorem.
And he has everything.	Et habet ad omnia.
I didn't know what to do first.	Ego nesciebam quid primum facerem.
which I could see.	quod videre potui.
I didn't know what to do.	Nesciebam id facere posse.
He could do anything, though.	Aliquid facere posset, sed.
He is alone.	Solus est.
You don't need to talk to him.	Non debes ei dicere.
Boy, it's not much.	Puer, non multum est.
Why not? 	Cur non?
he says.	dicit.
Nothing can be more true.	Nihil amplius quam verum esse potest.
Police have not said.	Aliquam nec dictum est.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
I don't know if we can do it again.	Nescio adhuc si id facere possumus.
We'll help each other.	Nos te adiuvet inter se.
It could be something or nothing.	Posset esse aliquid, vel nihil esse.
I've done a lot of work for you right now.	Ego feci tibi multum iam opus est.
I do it too.	Ego id quoque.
This was what he wanted.	Hoc erat quod voluit.
Even in time itself.	Etiam in tempus ipsum.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
That is.	Id est.
work had to be done.	opus erat faciendum.
We're all busy, but we're a lot of things.	Omnes sumus occupatus, sed multum sumus.
I can't do this again.	Non possum hoc iterum fieri.
I wish I would.	Nolo vellem.
I know what.	Scio quid.
He understood, he said.	Intellexit, dixit se.
Today, it is no longer there.	Hodie, id est iam non est.
If you want to be the same one.	Si vis esse ipse unus.
Right after you.	Recte post te.
Now it wasn't him.	Nunc non ipsum erat.
I love it with me.	Amo mecum est.
I know you have.	Scio te habere.
But the thing was for him.	Sed res erat ei.
No one saw him.	Nemo eum vidit.
To know each other.	Scire se.
But it was always always.	Sed semper semper erat.
.	.
We have something for everyone this year.	Aliquid habemus hoc anno pro omnibus.
Yes, there is still work here.	Ita, hic tamen opus est.
But this has been said late.	Hoc autem sero dictum est.
I'm surprised you're here.	Miror te hic esse.
She knew him by all means.	Illa eum per omnia scivit.
I can't get it, yet.	Id habere non possum, nondum.
He never understood.	Nunquam intellexit.
You could very well appreciate.	Optime bene posset tibi.
Tell me what you want to play.	Dic quid ludere velis.
But he did not.	Sed non fecit.
Probably no one will.	Verisimiliter nemo vult.
I'm glad this didn't happen.	Hoc factum non gaudeo.
I had time.	tempus habui.
But there was no wish.	Sed velit non erat.
You do your job.	Facis officium tuum.
Maybe it was even him.	Aliquam vel erat ipsum.
He says nothing more, but.	Nihil amplius dicit, sed.
That's good to know.	Quod bonum est scire.
Almost everyone says something to do.	Fere omnes dicit aliquid faciendum.
Yes that is great.	Etiam id magna est.
I am not helping.	Non sum auxilium.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
Certainly nothing has been done.	Nihil certe factum est.
I thought my mom was wrong.	Cogitavi meum, quod malum est.
I don't want to deal with him now.	Nolo cum eo nunc agere.
You have both.	Utrumque habes.
And you know way too much.	Et tu nimium scis modo.
I can't speak.	Non possum dicere.
I don't play.	Non ludere.
I'm sorry to have been here at all.	Paenitet omnino hic fuisse.
This is not per se.	Hoc per se non est.
You're definitely busy.	Certe occupatus es.
Not out.	Nec e.
That's who you are.	Ut quis ipsum quam.
This was one plan.	Hoc erat unum consilium.
No, you know.	Non, scis.
There was certainly something he could do.	Fuit certe id quod potuit.
Yes my car is.	Ita currus est.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
More now than ever.	Plus nunc, quam semper.
This was the same thing.	Erat hoc idem.
I never made a good trip.	Numquam bene iter fecit.
Which is three.	Quod est tres.
This is only for us.	Hoc tantum nobis.
You know this better than me.	Tu scis hoc melius quam me.
This was me.	Hoc mihi erat.
There is work to do tomorrow.	Est opus facere cras.
But you forgot.	Sed tu oblitus es.
What was this done?	Quid hoc factum est.
You know why you're here.	Tu scis cur hic sis.
It's not that much.	Etiam non quam.
But you can never see yourself.	Sed numquam te ipsum videre potes.
By this you do not owe it to yourself.	Per hoc per te non debes.
But that's the same thing now.	Sed id ipsum nunc.
You have to do it.	Habes ad id.
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla nisi.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
May He help us.	Ipse nos adiuvet.
This is what is going to happen now.	Hoc futurum est, quod nunc est.
Maybe something is going to happen in the near future.	Fortasse aliquid in proximo futurum est.
It is always late.	Sero semper.
You know that they are.	Scis se esse.
You know.	Scis.
He was looking.	Vultus erat.
But now all these things together.	Sed simul haec omnia iam.
But not all.	Sed nec omnes.
I can always hear from you.	Semper te audire possum.
He didn't know what he wanted.	Nesciebat quis velit.
It has time.	Sic habet tempus.
nothing more than I have done.	nihil amplius quam id feci.
Do what you can to do.	Quod facere potes, fac fac.
But this really has nothing to do with it.	Sed hoc vere nihil ad rem.
He is with us here.	Apud nos est hic.
No one wants nothing.	Nulla quis velit nisi.
Maybe one day.	Fortasse die.
It is difficult.	Difficile est.
That is good	Id est bonum .
Probably never.	Probabiliter numquam.
In their own way.	Suo modo.
I just wanted something to be done.	Modo aliquid fieri voluit.
Which for him, he did all.	Quod ad ipsum, totum fecit.
It could be either way.	Utrumque posse.
I wanted the best too.	Optime etiam me volui.
Now back to reality.	Nunc ad rem.
It's just hard to say.	Suus 'iustus dicere difficile est'.
So good for her job.	Ita bonum eius officium.
and what day it was.	et quis dies esset.
Something is wrong.	Malum est aliquid.
He doesn't even know how to think.	Ne hoc quidem scit cogitare.
It is.	Dictum est.
You can't do it anymore.	Non potes amplius.
Maybe that was it.	Aliquam id erat.
All this has been done.	Hoc totum factum est.
You should never do this.	Hoc numquam facere debes.
All these things are not for me anymore.	Haec omnia mihi iam non sunt.
It does not please.	Non placet.
I didn't know who.	Nesciebam quis.
But we cannot stay there.	Sed non possumus ibi manere.
Too much good is its own good.	Nimium bonum est suum bonum.
This he did.	Hoc fecit.
That's what you know.	Id scis.
This is so.	Hoc ita sit.
But this was not at all.	Sed hoc omnino non erat.
But who only	Sed quis nisi.
Maybe not so.	Forte non ita.
not much from him.	non multum ab eo.
She's just as good as she said to me.	Illa sicut bonum quod dixit ad me.
And it will be.	Erit autem illud.
I haven't seen you yet.	Non vidi adhuc.
This also is not true.	Hoc quoque non est verum.
Being able to do what I love.	Facere posse quod amo.
Why not? 	Cur non?
He knows all men.	Novit omnes homines.
But never let it out.	Sed numquam id ex.
I just couldn't do it today.	Modo hodie facere non potui.
We can't stay here now.	Hic nunc manere non possumus.
I don't want to talk about it ever again.	Nolo semper iterum de eo loqui.
He was well.	Bene erat.
We are really bad.	Vere mali sumus.
You don't want me here.	Hic mihi non vis.
I've decided not to do anything here.	Certum aliquid non hic.
It was already too late.	Sit iam sero.
No, but it was great.	Nulla sed magna erat.
Now is a good time.	Nunc tempus bonum.
We can't help you anymore.	Te amplius adiuvare non possumus.
I can't be right, at least not yet.	Non possum recte, certe nondum.
You are evil.	Vos malum.
And he says well of you.	Et bene dicit de vobis.
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum est.
I don't like him.	Non amo illum.
So we're at home.	Sic domi sumus.
She travels a lot.	Multum illa iter.
But I just didn't realize how lucky he was before that time.	Sed modo quam felix ante id tempus non intellexit.
Maybe next year.	Fortasse anno.
He had.	Habuit.
Yes, it was not.	Etiam non erat.
I feel this way.	Haec ita sentio.
I wanted to say something, something.	Aliquid dicere volui, aliquid.
So get together.	Ita ut simul.
He probably didn't think that time.	Probabiliter non putat tempus illud.
I have to talk to someone.	Loqui aliquem habeo.
i'm never good enough.	numquam satis sum.
I love the race.	Genus amo.
By being something.	Per esse aliquid.
He did this to himself.	Fecit hoc posse sibi.
I feel good, really.	Bene sentio, vere.
We like it a lot.	Multum nobis simile est.
Easy, sure.	Facile, certo.
Nothing more.	Nihil amplius.
You can have it if you want.	Potes habere si vis.
You forgot the man.	Oblitus es homo est.
I know everything you want to say.	Novi omnia dicere vis.
But that was the time.	Sed id tempus erat.
And little else.	Et parum aliud.
He loves me not.	Me non amat.
He was in that very thing.	In id ipsum erat.
We need to talk to you.	Necesse est nobis loqui tecum.
But you can't go there yet, and stay.	Sed adhuc ibi ire non potes, et mane.
Yes, it was after all.	Sic, post omnes non fuit.
He knows how it can be.	Scit hoc esse quomodo possit.
Just make me.	Modo fac me.
You are the same.	Tu ipse es.
I don't know what's still there.	Nescio quid est etiam ibi.
Which is exactly true.	Quod prorsus verum est.
I just love her.	Ego iustus amo eam.
Now he wanted to live better.	Nunc voluit melius vivere.
But it was time.	Sed tempus erat.
I guess so, and I hope.	Suspicor ita, et spero.
He had no time.	Tempus non habuit.
All is well now.	Iam omnia bene.
So now we are.	Sic nunc sumus.
That's what I'll do.	Id faciam.
I thought about everything.	Cogitavi de omnibus.
This is nothing else.	Hoc nihil ad aliud.
I was never there.	Numquam ibi essem.
I have to stop.	Habeo prohibere.
To sit before, during, or after.	Ut sit ante, tempore vel post.
At least this time.	Hoc certe tempore.
You have done your job.	Tuum officium fecisti.
I don't need anymore.	Non opus est amplius.
These are my goods.	Haec sunt bona mea.
None of the three came.	Tres nemo venit.
You must believe this.	Hoc debes credere.
I had forgotten.	Oblitus erat.
He was here.	Hic erat.
it will be certain for me.	certum mihi erit.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
See if you have any of it.	Vide si quid ex eo.
We all have.	Omnes nos habemus.
He told me to get you there.	Dixit mihi ad te illuc.
It is not true of me.	Non est verum de me.
That is very good.	Quod valde bonum est.
This has been done.	Hoc factum est.
It's what you do.	Est quod facis.
This was what he did.	Hoc erat quod fecit.
That's not up to your room.	Quod non est usque ad cubiculum tuum.
He is a truly good man.	Vere bonus homo est.
He did so.	Fecit ille ita.
He said he probably would this week.	Dixit verisimiliter fore hac septimana.
They're what you want.	Sunt vis.
Well here you have it.	Bene hic habes.
No, no no no.	Nulla, nulla nulla enim.
I did poorly tonight.	Male feci hac nocte.
Do this now.	Fac hoc modo.
Not only is it better.	Nec solus melius.
We don't have time.	Non habemus tempus.
He has not yet spoken.	Nondum ipse dixit.
Maybe not the same thing.	Aliquam non ipsum quam.
I don't even see it.	Ne id quidem video.
Which he did well.	Quod bene fecit.
I hope at least they are not.	Spero certe non sunt.
The man seemed certain.	Vir pro certo videbatur.
All right, as always.	Recte, ut semper.
But not too much.	Sed non nimis.
This was what he wanted.	Hoc erat quod voluit.
That's enough.	Quod satis est.
That's what he does.	Id quod facit.
It could be done.	Fieri potuit.
Not even that.	Ne id quidem.
That's it right now.	Ut id nunc est.
Look after us.	Vide post nos.
I really like this thing.	Ego rem hanc vere amo.
But it was necessary, and there was need.	Sed necesse erat, et opus erat.
He likes to be himself.	Velit ut ipsum.
This means it can't be.	Hoc modo non potest esse.
I don't know the whole thing.	Nescio totum.
But all these are still little.	Sed haec omnia adhuc parum sunt.
Its either going to happen or not.	Eius vel futurum vel non.
I'll tell you if you need it.	Dicam tibi, si opus sit.
I am indebted to you.	Debeo.
Nothing to do with it.	Ad id nihil.
He saw evil.	Vidit malum.
No, but it is always.	Nulla sed semper est.
Do not do more than that which is.	Ne hoc plus facias quam id quod est.
I've never seen it so late.	Nunquam tam sero vidi.
This is the only one who could speak.	Solus hic est qui dicere potuit.
Time was not enough.	Tempus non erat satis.
How you can.	Quomodo potes.
We all need it well.	Bene omnibus nobis opus est.
I don't think it would be.	Non puto fore.
I don't know how it is.	Nescio quomodo est .
Well we have, and we have not.	Bene habemus, et non habemus.
Why are you here.	Cur hic sis.
There is none.	Nulla est.
It is a good work.	Opus bonum est.
It was more than it seemed to be.	Plus erat quam videbatur esse.
Which he does quite well.	Quod satis bene facit.
It was true, she did not want it.	Verum erat, eam nolebat.
They are scarce.	Vix sunt.
He looks at her leaving the room.	Spectat eam cubiculum relinquere.
He never told me how he knew.	Numquam mihi dixit quomodo sciebat.
But this was not going to happen.	Sed hic non erat futurum.
This time it works.	Hoc tempore agit.
But I don't like it.	Sed non placet.
It's better to go.	Melius est ut.
There was a man after all.	Homo erat post omnes.
To-morrow or	Ut, cras vel.
No one knows.	Nemo scit.
That's one thing.	Id unum.
He's here to help.	Hic ad auxilium est.
I do almost the same.	idem fere facio.
He gave some interest.	Dedit rem aliquam.
I wanted nothing.	nihil volui.
Use this if you want.	Hac, si vis.
I would like to do this for so long.	Tam diu hoc vellem.
I think there will be more.	Puto plus futurum.
That's a great idea.	Ut id magna est.
He had to do it himself.	Facere eum erat ipsum.
I like it too.	Placet id quoque.
You need to do your work.	Opus tuum facere debes.
You did that.	Fecisti id.
It was not even that.	Etiam nec erat quam.
Not at the same time.	Non simul.
We have what we have.	Habere quod et nos habemus.
It is a great thing.	Magna res est.
And this was my plan.	Et hoc consilium meum erat.
I can't do this.	Hoc mihi facere non potest.
Yes, as has been said.	Etiam ut dictum est.
I don't want you here either.	Nolo te huc quidem.
He only wanted this job.	Solus hoc officium voluit.
It is the same.	Idem est.
He wasn't sure if it was okay.	Non erat certus si bene erat.
I could not persuade her to go.	ei persuadere non potui ire.
There he said.	ibi dixit.
But he did not want to say or to not know.	Ille autem noluit dicere vel nescire.
To or from the school.	Ut vel ex erat.
As stated above.	Sicut dictum est.
To the.	Ad rem.
which I owe you much.	quod tibi multum debeo.
He gave this to him.	Hoc ei dedit.
But it is so difficult.	Sed tam difficile est.
This is already done.	Id iam est.
If you're not one of us.	Si unus ex nobis non es.
Maybe that's said nothing.	Aliquam id dictum nisi.
There was no such thing as him.	Nulla ut ipsum erat.
This one.	Hoc unum.
Here it is, and here it is.	Hic est, et hic est.
It is important to save some.	Aliquam sit amet aliquam nisi.
I owe you	tibi debeo.
When he went away, he went away.	Cum abiit, abiit.
It is mine.	Sic mea est.
Maybe not.	Aliquam non.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
But let's be honest.	Sed sit amet.
All well but one.	Bene omnes, sed unus.
But he was in none.	Sed in nulla erat.
Do this, and nothing more.	Hoc fac, et nihil amplius.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
But not this morning.	Sed non hoc mane.
You can say.	Potes dicere.
I know your nationality.	Novi genus tuum.
She didn't want to talk to him at all.	Noluit eam omnino cum eo loqui.
He was quite busy.	Satis occupatus erat.
Time has always been said.	Aliquam semper tempus dictum.
He didn't know at all what time it was.	Omnino nesciebat quid tempus esset.
But it is true.	Sed verum est.
AND THE FATHER	ET PATER.
And he knew that this could not be done.	Et sciebat se id fieri non posse.
I need to tell you.	Mihi opus est tibi dicere.
Don't play this way.	Noli hoc modo ludere.
I know by him and by him.	per ipsum et per scio.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
It's never a long time.	Numquam diu est.
In this way he said well.	Hoc modo bene dixit.
Certainly someone should know something.	Certe aliquis debet aliquid scire.
Now that's what you said.	Nunc id dictum te.
Now that was it.	Nunc id erat.
After this job has been easy.	Post hoc officium facile fuit.
But who is great?	Sed quis magna est.
I don't care that way.	Nolo modo illa.
Everyone has a name.	Omnes nomen habet.
I feel pretty.	satis sentio.
It was so.	Sic erat.
Or perhaps he doesn't want to be seen.	Vel fortasse videri non vult.
He did what he could.	Fecit quod potuit.
I have seen your work.	Vidi opus tuum.
He also likes it himself.	Etiam id ipsum velit.
That's more than you know.	Id plus scis.
And this is true.	Et, hoc verum est.
To tell the truth.	Ut vere dicam.
I was always there for you.	Ibi semper fui tibi.
I can do more than you can.	Non possum non plus quam potes.
This often does not.	Hoc saepe non facit.
It's time to be honest, no.	Aliquam sit amet nulla, nulla.
No, not him.	Non, ipsum.
for it will never, never be.	numquam enim, numquam erit.
But he said yes.	Etiam sed dictum ipsum.
And now that seems true.	Et nunc, quod verum videtur.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
If it seems so well.	Quod si ita videtur, bene.
i had to think about it.	de illo habui cogitare.
I don't think much.	Non multum puto.
I don't know whether he likes it.	Nescio an velit.
This did not seem to him.	Hoc ei non videbatur.
I don't like it much.	Non multum placet.
He didn't want to find out.	Noluit invenire.
He will be with us soon.	Mox nobiscum erit.
I didn't want anything from him.	Nihil ab eo nolui.
i love you a lot.	multum amo.
We really like it.	Vere placet nobis.
never out.	Numquam e.
Not us.	Non nobis.
He was not.	Non erat.
And as was said before.	Et ut ante dictum est.
And that is something.	Id autem est aliquid.
Well, good work.	Bene, opus bonum est.
I'm sorry .	Me paenitet .
And this is not really true.	Et hoc non est vere verum.
He cannot speak.	Loqui non potest.
I forgot.	Oblitus sum.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
Not much, he thought.	Non multum, putabat.
I want.	Volo.
It was another thing too.	Aliud quoque erat.
You can go in and out.	Potes ire et in.
I forgot before.	Oblitus sum ante.
I have heard.	Audivi.
The man said nothing.	Vir nihil dixit.
That's not what I said.	Ut non dictum quam.
That's it.	Id ei.
I hope I'm too.	Spero me nimis.
And perhaps more than that.	Et fortasse quam.
it seemed	videbatur .
what should i do.	quid faciam.
I don't feel alone anymore.	Solus amplius non sentio.
You don't need to talk like this.	Non debes sic loqui.
It's not good for him.	Non est sibi bonus.
That would always be right.	Semper id fore recte.
Well, there it is.	Bene, ibi est.
You don't need to do that at all.	Quod omnino facere non debes.
did not succeed.	Non obtinuit.
I can't speak either.	Non possum dicere, vel.
It is possible, however.	Fieri tamen potest.
I'm playing with a guy over there.	A guy ibi me ludere.
It was early this morning.	Mane hoc mane factum est.
Never, but barely.	Numquam, vix, sed.
yes not always.	Etiam non semper est.
I feel what I feel.	Sentio quod sentio.
I have to live with it.	Habeo vivere cum illo.
Well there are a lot of things.	Bene multum ibi sumus.
Your work could be done.	Opus tuum posse.
They are still together.	Adhuc una sunt.
It was just day after day.	Is iustus erat de die in diem.
But you must do this to me.	Sed hoc mihi debes facere.
I told you already.	Dixi iam tibi.
nor yet.	nec tamen.
It couldn't be too hard either.	Vel difficile non potuit.
It was easy for everyone.	Facile omnes.
When you like.	Cum libet.
And well by it.	Et bene per eam.
I like to talk a lot too.	Etiam multum loqui placet.
Someone from before.	Aliquis ex ante.
Him, not mine.	Illum, non meum.
He comes to me after a.	Venit ad me post a.
That's with me.	Id cum ad me.
You might like what you have.	Fortasse simile quid habes.
He does not know what it is.	Nescit quid sit.
There is work.	Est opus.
That's what it was like.	Eius id erat ut.
Don't talk to me.	Noli mihi dicere.
To go, to go, to go.	Ire ire ire.
I am a happy person.	Homo sum felix.
Someone knows something.	Aliquis scit aliquid.
All too.	Omnes quoque.
Close to the car.	Proxima ad currus.
I'm going to my room.	Eo ad cubiculum meum.
He says that he is not.	Dicit se non esse.
Most of the time it was needed.	Plus temporis opus fuit.
But none but him.	Nulla sed ipsum nisi.
He knew, he thought.	Sciebat, putavit.
There's just too much.	Ibi nimium iustus est.
I'm not exactly sure of that.	Non sum prorsus certus in illo.
We can only do what we can.	Non possumus facere nisi quod possumus.
You are only for me.	Tu modo ad me.
Never say anything like that.	Numquam aliquid simile ei.
A lot of time tonight.	Multum temporis hac nocte.
I don't know whether he saw it or not.	Nescio utrum vidit necne.
It is very good.	Bonus nimis est.
We're both still alive.	Ambo adhuc sumus.
What he thought was to be done.	Quod faciendum putabat.
There is no time for that.	Nulla sit amet tempus quam.
But you can't have everything.	Sed omnia habere non potes.
Yes exactly.	Ita prorsus.
He can talk as much as he likes.	Loqui potest quantum velit.
Now it was not.	Nunc non erat.
Again the teacher was very sorry.	Iterum magister erat valde.
Do it for yourself.	Fac ut pro te.
To know is better than not to know.	Scire est melius quam nescire.
But he was in now.	Sed in nunc erat.
Nothing else can be.	Nihil aliud esse potest.
Which ones are	Quae sunt.
It is essentially and per se.	Est per se et per se.
Usually not.	Fere, non.
His father was a teacher.	Pater eius magister fuit.
It was a good thing.	Erat autem bona res.
Or perhaps they are.	Vel fortasse sunt.
Now there are things you need to know.	Iam sunt quae scire debes.
No that's more important than that.	Nulla id magna quam.
Yes, but it was said by which, that which was said.	Etiam sed dictum quam, id dictum quam.
he is still and loves.	adhuc est, et amat.
But still he gave me something.	Sed tamen aliquid mihi dedit.
It looks real.	Spectat verum.
Now, maybe that's good.	Nunc, fortasse id bonum.
And so he did not.	Et sic non fecit.
He gave it and some.	Dedit id et aliquam.
You did not tell me about this.	De hoc mihi non dixisti.
For all of us, you're fine.	Pro omnibus nobis, tu bene.
It was time.	Tempus erat.
Which, indeed, was true.	Quod quidem, verum erat.
He could not do this any more.	Hoc amplius facere non potuit.
This is possible, but not easy.	Hoc potest, sed non facile.
I've never seen anything like it before.	Nunquam ante vidi quicquam simile.
You know what to do, just do it.	Scis quid facias, modo fac.
That's if you're lucky.	Id si nimium felix es.
He did well too.	Bene quoque fecit.
There is no need in us.	In nobis hoc non est opus.
who was in school today.	qui hodie in schola habuit.
I think you are busy you are a busy person.	Puto te occupatus es homo occupatus.
I wanted to do this on my own.	Hoc facere volui meum.
He was lucky and knew.	Felix ille fuit et scivit.
They are always there.	Semper sunt.
I really hope so.	Ita vere spero.
What does this mean?	Quid hoc sibi vult.
I saw something.	aliquid vidi.
Even in the present.	Etiam in nunc enim.
He also says.	Ipse etiam dicit.
Great for you.	Magna tibi.
I don't get what you want.	Non id quod vis.
I believe that	Credo quod .
I want your wife.	Volo te uxorem.
No, no, yes.	Non, non, etiam.
That's with me.	Id cum ad me.
There was not a lot of time at all.	Omnino non multum temporis fuit.
Yes they are.	Ita sunt.
It is the game itself.	Ipsum est velit.
It is not.	non est.
But they are nothing.	Sed nihil sunt.
Which should be better.	Quod melius debet.
Do you have any .	Habesne .
I want to say this alone.	Hoc solum dicere volo.
I can't stay with him.	Apud eum non possum.
He will not.	Non vult.
I didn't want to discuss it.	Nolui de eo.
I have a book about it.	Librum de eo habeo.
I do too, but he does more.	Facio etiam, sed plus facit.
I could hardly speak.	Vix loqui potui.
This was not his plan.	Hoc eius consilium non fuit.
But he could do well.	Sed bene potuit.
He could have done better.	Potuit tamen melius.
It has not just been said.	Non modo dictum est.
Call me if you do.	Me si feceris.
Maybe not tonight, but finally.	Fortasse non hac nocte, sed tandem.
But that's not good.	Sed id non bene.
That he was not.	Ut non erat.
Not I.	Non ego.
No, completely different.	Non, omnino aliud.
i love you that way.	amo te illo modo.
But that is none.	Sed id est nulla.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
He knew what this meant.	Sciebat quid hoc esset.
Now he speaks badly.	Modo male loquitur.
More fun than it was.	Plus, quam sit amet erat.
This is not my plan.	Hoc non est meum consilium.
I was not.	Ego non eram.
He has done nothing to this day.	Nihil adhuc hodie fecit.
Some even understood some.	Etiam intellexit aliquam aliquam.
He looks at me again.	Iterum me spectat.
Not that he was scared.	Nec quod erat vix.
He said that he was together.	Dixit se esse simul.
Unable to stop.	Posset prohibere.
So I'm afraid.	Ita vereor.
i never knew about it.	de hoc numquam scivi.
she wanted to discuss.	de Voluit.
It was not so.	Non ita se habuit.
Has a good job.	Habet officium bonum.
But certainly we are.	Sed certe sumus.
Not to be.	Non esse.
That is not true.	Quod non est.
Probably not soon enough for me.	Verisimiliter non cito satis mihi.
is very busy.	Is est valde occupatus.
It's great and great.	Est magna et magna.
it seems like a good thing.	sicut bonum videtur.
how can i do it.	quam id possum.
I know what's happened.	Scio quid acciderit.
This seems pretty easy to accept.	Hoc satis facile videtur accipere.
You are not there.	Non ibi.
As always, alone.	Ut semper, solum.
He wanted to do the job.	Voluit officium facere.
Even what has been said before.	Etiam quis dictum ante.
.	.
You can help.	Adiuvare potes.
I need it.	Mihi opus est.
But this is not very probable.	Sed hoc non admodum probabile.
Who was.	Quis erat.
This is not up to you.	Hoc non est ad.
I wanted better than you.	Volui melius quam tu.
I think you'd both.	Puto utrumque velis.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
Today, it is all right.	Hodie, recte est.
I know what it's going to be.	Scio quid suus facturus sit.
But none at all either.	Sed vel ipsum nulla.
he saw something more.	plus aliquid vidit.
I don't believe that.	Non credo esse.
I did not know.	Nesciebam.
That's good!.	Illud bonum!.
There is no such thing.	Nulla id ipsum est.
I have not seen you.	Non vidi te.
He bought it again.	Emit illud.
Something occurred to me.	Aliquid mihi occurrit.
Now that was out.	Nunc id erat ex.
She is at home.	Domi est.
We can do nothing about it.	De illo nihil possumus facere.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
could not find.	Non potuit invenire.
It doesn't seem to be with anyone.	Non videtur esse cum aliquo.
I want everything to be there.	Volo ibi omnia esse.
You can help.	Potes adiuvare.
No in unless he wants.	Nulla in nisi velit.
Now it is for sure.	Iam certe est.
You never know from him.	Numquam ex illum.
But without.	Sed sine.
Maybe it's not my plan.	Forte, non est meum consilium.
He saw something in me.	In me aliquid vidit.
Maybe that's a great time.	Aliquam id tempus magna.
I know he wants to help you.	Scio te adiuvare velle.
No one knows but you.	Nemo scit nisi tu.
I wanted to know everything.	omnia scire volui.
Mine certainly does.	Meum certe habet.
There was no time in it.	Nulla in tempus erat.
He is for us.	Ipse pro nobis est.
What you need to do.	Quod debes facere.
You know what's wrong.	Tu scis quid mali facias.
He wanted to stay a little longer.	Paulo diutius manere voluit.
Maybe who it was.	Aliquam quis erat erat.
I was not alone anymore.	Solus non eram amplius.
yes or no ex.	Etiam vel dictum ex.
Just really sick as you are now.	Iustus vere male sicut nunc es.
Yes, not only yourself.	Etiam non nisi ipsum.
For him too.	Pro eo quoque.
Yes it is, so it was.	Ita est, sic fuit.
Here he's doing the right thing.	Huc ille rem recte facere.
and he said that he did not know why.	et dixit se nescire quare.
Not so much.	Non ita nimis.
They are just doing it.	Facere id solum sunt.
I must accept.	accipere debeo.
Maybe not great.	Aliquam non magna.
Make sure she doesn't come here.	Fac illa huc non venit.
But not before.	Sed non enim ante.
if only he knew what would happen.	si modo sciebat quid esset futurum.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Maybe been there for a long time.	Forte ibi diu.
I don't like it much.	Non multum placet.
Without me.	Sine me ipsum.
don't do it yourself.	id ipsum ne.
But there is no need.	Sed non opus est.
Ex.	Ex .
I never saw him.	Numquam eum vidi.
I hope all is well.	Spero bene.
You have it here.	Ita hic habes.
That's something to do with it.	Quod ut aliquid ad rem.
if you are a man	si homo es.
He didn't know what to do.	Nesciebat quid faceret.
I don't play video.	Video non ludere.
Maybe three.	Fortasse tres.
No one or none.	Nulla vel quis nulla.
It's not too late for me.	Sero non est mihi.
Now what? 	Iam quid?
It was not good at all.	Non erat omnino bonum.
But that is where we are.	Sed id est quo sumus.
Here, no.	Hic, nulla.
Even through all this will never be enough.	Etiam per totum id numquam satis erit.
You just can't do it anymore.	Tu modo id amplius facere non potes.
The first thing is about this.	Primum est de hoc aliquid.
No one has done anything like this.	Nemo hoc simile fecit.
He could not.	Potuit.
I think they can do it.	Puto posse id facere.
Everything is there for sure.	Ibi omnia certe.
How easy! 	Quam facile!
he thought.	putavit.
We are very sorry.	Valde sumus.
I will always tell the truth.	Semper verum dicam.
They just aren't there.	Iustus non sunt ibi.
This is always true.	Hoc semper verum est.
I tried to think.	Conatus cogitare.
This is very difficult.	Hoc est valde difficile.
There's always that before.	Nulla semper id ante.
But he did not.	Sed non fecit.
I can see in him.	in eo videre possum.
And do this quickly.	Et hoc fac cito.
It is probably late now.	Probabile est nunc sero.
It was great.	In magna erat.
he will be after.	ipse post erit.
It is not what he did.	Non est id quod fecit.
Where do you go.	Ubi ire quid.
I hope you can hear me now.	Spero me nunc audire potes.
You don't have me, please.	Me non habes, sis.
Maybe a little.	Fortasse paulo.
I'm going with him, father.	Eo cum eo, pater.
No one wants him to play, just to listen.	Nemo non vult eum ludere, modo audire.
I don't like it all the time.	Non omnibus omnibus placet tempus.
It was after something.	Post aliquid fuit.
That should not be done.	Quod fieri non debet.
Truly with you.	Vere tecum.
Another thing came.	Aliud venit.
He who wills evil.	Qui male vult.
Just think of me.	Sicut me putat.
I don't like to be done.	Non placet fieri.
But this time itself.	Sed id tempus ipsum.
But he was not behind.	Sed non erat post.
He does not come to me.	Non venit ad me.
Now there is a question.	Iam quaestio est.
Who can help me?	Quis me adiuvet.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
We truly are.	Vere nos.
He always says it.	Semper id dicit.
I'm glad you could come.	gaudeo te posse venire.
I think there's effort.	Conatu's ibi puto.
Who knows why he didn't.	Quis scit cur non fecerit.
He knew what he was going to do today.	Sciebat quid facturus esset hodie.
We all know that too.	Omnes id quoque.
He knew that he was not.	Sciebat se non esse.
I think he would do that.	Puto facturum esse.
But at this time nothing is to be done.	Sed hoc tempore nihil faciendum est.
I'm glad to be him.	Gaudeo eum esse.
He was in him.	Erat in illo.
And perhaps he could.	Et fortasse potuit.
It's not hard to do.	Non difficile est facere.
Looks like you were yesterday.	Te heri similis.
Was .	Esset .
It was bad.	Malum fuit.
Which, indeed, he did not do.	Quod quidem non faceret.
It could not have been done that way.	Fieri non potuit, ut modo.
I've never been before.	Nunquam ante fui.
That's him too.	Ut et ipsum est.
I always know where it is.	Semper scio ubi sit.
How this question was made.	Quam quaestionem hoc factum est.
I don't know, but perhaps you do.	Nescio, sed fortasse facis.
what is better than?.	quid melius quam ?.
No one knows anything about him.	Nemo de eo aliquid scit.
I don't like you anymore.	Non amo te amplius.
My job is doing just that.	Meum officium hoc modo facit.
I just came to talk to her.	Modo venit ad eam loqui.
We probably would like to.	Verisimiliter vellem.
I can't stop it.	Non possum prohibere illud.
As I have not said before.	Ut non dictum ante.
He wanted all of it.	Voluit ex eo omnes.
It's okay to know.	Scire bene est.
He will never say never.	Qui numquam id numquam.
This has been done for me.	Hoc mihi factum est.
I've done everything.	Ego feci omnibus.
Perhaps that was true.	Forsitan id verum fuit.
They are no longer for themselves, but for themselves.	Non iam sibi, sed sibi sunt.
But it was not the same thing.	Non erat id ipsum, sed.
You have me there.	Habes me ibi.
Which was the first time.	Quod erat primum.
but there will be one.	sed unus erit.
I have heard you.	Audivi te.
That has nothing to do with it.	Quod nihil ad rem.
He had not much of it.	De illo multa non habuit.
But not only.	Sed non nisi.
There is work to be done.	Est opus faciendum.
I have nothing at all about him.	Nihil de illo omnino habeo.
Something is going to do.	Aliquid facturus est.
It's too little.	Etiam parum est.
Maybe she really loves me.	Fortasse vere amat me.
I know I will do the same for you.	Idem faciam tibi scio.
He came in this way.	Hoc modo venit.
Do not do this and do it.	Noli hoc facere et illud fac.
Look at the bottom.	Solum in vide.
So he has.	Ita habet.
Now we're here.	Nunc hic sumus.
There was no tomorrow.	Cras non erat.
Or something like that.	Vel aliquid ut.
But there was a lot to do.	Sed sit amet erat.
I can see for sure.	Certo quod videre possum.
I met him yesterday.	Occurrit heri ei.
That was fine by me.	Quod a me bene fuit.
You do the same.	Idem facis.
Right, you can't.	Recte, non potes.
I don't want to hear it again.	Nolo iterum audire.
This is what they are.	Hoc est ad quod sunt.
But it does not remain.	Sed non manere.
Work is still working.	Opus adhuc opus est.
I still don't believe.	Adhuc non credere.
You have done this yourself.	Hoc tu ipse fecisti.
They are there.	Ibi sunt.
To wish to win, to be willing to live.	Vincere velle, velle vivere.
He already knows a lot of things well.	Iam multum bene scit.
We have him first.	Eum primum habemus.
How bad is that?	Quam malum est.
I don't go to school with you.	Non ad scholam tecum.
It has not always been.	Sic non semper fuit.
Don't make money.	Pecuniam non facere.
I can play with it.	Ludere possum cum illo.
You will need time.	Opus tibi tempus erit.
This should not be done.	Hic non debet.
We have a lot to talk about.	Multa loqui habemus.
It is also great.	Etiam magna est.
It could be this week.	Posset hac septimana.
But not right.	Sed non recte.
Play well there.	Ludere bene est.
But I've never seen anything like it.	Nunquam tamen aliquid simile vidi.
Please see me now.	Quaeso, vide modo me.
There is no question.	Nulla quaestio est.
Not for us.	Non pro nobis.
So pretty much the man.	Ita fere homo.
as it seems to me.	ut mihi videtur.
He was already a man.	Homo iam erat.
I wonder what you're doing.	Miror te facere.
But that's not the only thing.	Sed id non solum.
But that's not the same thing.	Sed id nulla ipsum.
nor did he wish to know.	nec scire voluit.
I'm at home now.	Nunc domi sum.
But who knows.	Sed quis scit .
But make a trip here if you have the time.	Sed fac iter hic si tempus habes.
You must do this.	Hoc facere debes.
This plan has just started today.	Hoc consilium est sicut hodie incepit.
I thought that would happen.	Putavi fore.
That can be done.	Quod potest fieri.
You can do nothing now.	Nihil nunc facere potes.
The same is true today.	Hoc idem hodie verum est.
Not sure how to do it.	Certo quomodo hoc facias.
But there was some.	Aliquam sed erat.
I don't want anything for you.	Nolo quod tibi.
Become one with him.	Fieri unum cum eo.
Rightly indeed.	Recte quidem.
I still believe.	Ego tamen credo.
I watch it.	Ego eam.
This is probably good.	Probabile est hoc bonum.
No one wants none.	Nulla in velit nulla.
that's a lot.	id est multum.
Do the work.	Opus fac.
He could not live here.	Vivere hic potuit.
I can't tell you more than now.	Non possum amplius tibi dicere quam nunc.
Do not believe.	Noli credere.
So all is well.	Ita omnia bene.
It was so.	Sic erat.
I didn't want help.	Auxilium nolui.
Or to see in the future.	Vel in futurum videre.
He was right.	Erat ille recte.
It is good for us.	Bonum est nobis.
But he's doing this job for you.	Sed hoc tibi hoc officium facit.
We can see.	Videre possumus.
He is the same.	Ipse est.
No one seemed to be there.	Nemo ibi esse videbatur.
There was nothing at all.	Nihil erat omnino.
Even before.	Etiam vel ante quam.
They are very good.	Valde bona sunt.
Something only.	Aliquid tantum.
He did not know what this meant.	Nesciebat quid hoc esset.
This he knew for certain.	Hoc pro certo sciebat.
He is well with us.	Bene nobiscum est.
And how much he wants to know.	Et quantum velit scire.
Not me, he never meant to say me.	Non me, numquam me voluit dicere.
Without you to be just.	Sine te ut sis iustus.
But if you do nothing, it will be nothing.	Sed si nihil feceris, nihil erit.
We didn't stay late.	Nos nuper non manere.
There was also one dog.	Erat et unus canis.
You don't need this.	Hoc non debes.
Nor had he.	Nec habuit.
She was .	Illa erat .
This is not such a good decision.	Hoc non est tam bene consilium.
which I think is true.	quod verum puto.
He knew what was going to happen.	Sciebat quid futurum esset.
But it was also great.	Sed et magna erat.
I think you already know.	Puto te iam scire.
We're all up to it.	Omnes sumus ad eam.
We can do so.	Ita facere possumus.
I'm here if you need anything.	Hic sum, si quid opus est.
One, you're with me.	Una, tu mecum.
he thought.	putavit.
It's still mine.	Meum adhuc est.
You're not OK.	Bene non es.
We have room there.	Cubiculum ibi habemus.
Not easy, this is for sure.	Non facile, hoc pro certo est.
There is not one thing which is the same.	Non est unum quod idem est.
I've decided about it already.	De eo certum iam.
I hope you stay here.	Spero te hic manere.
He has no name.	Nomen non habet.
It is important that it is.	Aliquam sit amet quam est.
To be honest for the first time.	Ut sit amet enim ante.
But it is great.	Sed magna est.
And that's a good question.	Et quod bonum quaestio est.
It wasn't much to see.	Non multum erat videre.
Which is not true.	Quod non est verum.
Maybe this may help you.	Forsitan hoc te adiuvet.
That would be me.	Mecum esse id.
You have done all things well.	Omnia bene fecisti.
But it is good.	Sed bonum est.
He did more than this.	Plus quam hoc fecit.
But before him.	Sed id ipsum ante.
He could do more if he wanted to.	Plus potuit, si vellet.
But they are not the same.	Sed non sunt ipsum.
She didn't know what she thought.	Nesciebat quid putavit.
Much time.	Multum temporis.
She gave nothing.	Nihil illa dedit.
You are a good boy.	Bonus puer es.
That's great.	Ut id magna.
Can't really do it.	Vere facere non potest.
Certainly not all are the same.	Certe non omnes idem sunt.
He didn't want him to do it.	Ipsum facere noluisse est ei.
Can't say enough good things about it.	Non potest satis bona de illo dicere.
I have done nothing wrong.	Nihil mali feci.
The same as you, really.	Idem quod tu, vere.
And that means a lot to me.	Et hoc est multum ad me.
I never got to say.	Numquam obtinuit dicere.
It's not nearly as bad as you think.	Non fere tam malum est quam putas.
It's bad, you know.	Malum est, scis.
he was truly a boy.	vere puer erat.
Australia now wants.	Australia nunc vult.
We are not that.	Non id sumus.
It was even before.	Etiam vel ante erat.
I have some.	Habeo aliquam.
The time has come when it is enough.	Tempus venit, cum satis est.
It is a bad question.	Malum est quaestio.
You can tell me your name.	Nomen tuum mihi dicere potes.
Let it be and .	Sit et .
Finally I feel the whole thing again.	Tandem iterum totum sentio.
But he was still alive.	Erat autem adhuc.
perhaps even mine.	fortasse etiam mea.
Not so much anymore.	Non ita amplius.
They are not as bad as men are.	Non sunt mali sicut homines sunt.
He wasn't sure if he could do it.	Certus non erat si id facere posset.
Police said it was great.	Aliquam dictum magna erat.
They are not good enough.	Non sunt satis.
I don't know him.	Ego eum non novi.
He is with us.	Eum nobis ex.
I thought we could be friends again.	Putabam nos posse iterum esse amicos.
He says what it is.	Dicit quid sit.
It would be great to see you.	Magna esset te videre.
If you haven't been for a long time.	Non diu si fuit.
Wherefore it was done.	Quare factum est.
Make you feel good.	Fac te bene.
It's not a good decision.	Non consilium bonum.
Now I can see.	Nunc videre possum.
But it is not seen.	Sed non videtur.
But it is not so.	Sed non est ita.
I wish it were true.	Utinam verum esset.
I am not sure.	Non sum certus.
They must do it themselves.	Faciendum sibi.
See you there!	Te ibi!.
But it is not true.	Sed non est verum.
He thought that there could be one.	Putabat unum posse esse.
We need to get people together.	Opus est ut homines in unum.
You need to see people.	Videre debes homines.
He was still in school.	Adhuc schola erat.
He did all things to him.	Omnia fecit ei.
It was good.	Bonum erat.
To be able to act in due time.	Posse agere in tempore suo.
He knows where.	Scit ubi.
You are a man.	Tu es homo.
He probably knew everything.	Probabiliter omnia sciebat.
i'm sorry for this.	Im paenitet hoc.
Men not looking.	Homines, non vultus.
You might need to get a day job again.	Fortasse opus est ut dies officium iterum.
yes but only that.	Etiam non nisi quam.
I don't have any money to call it mine.	Pecuniam aliquam non habeo ut mea dicam.
He would not, however.	Noluit tamen.
There is more to come.	Plus est venire.
You have done many things for us.	Multa fecisti nobis.
He wanted this.	Hoc voluit.
And it was evil.	Erat autem malum.
Yes that's An.	Etiam id An.
And he would not.	Et nolebat.
But he could not do it himself.	Sed id se facere non potuit.
i don't know enough.	nescio satis.
For he is not there.	Ipsum enim non ibi.
to think, to think, to think.	Cogitare, cogitare, cogitare.
Not even that.	Ne id quidem.
Again it was good.	Iterum bonum fuit.
There's even more.	Plus etiam ibi est.
People find where you are.	Homines invenire ubi sis.
Nothing can hinder me, not even me.	Nihil me prohibere potest, ne me quidem.
You are very good to me.	Tu es valde bonus mihi.
No one wants either.	Aliquam vel velit nulla.
As I said please.	Ut et dictum velit.
I just don't know how to get there.	Modo nescio quomodo illuc.
You did it to me.	Mihi feceris.
No one understood how to do it.	Nemo id facere intellexit.
Please call me today.	Quaeso me hodie.
Don't talk to yourself badly.	Noli tibi male dicere.
He does not know that we are human beings.	Nescit quidem nos homines esse.
She never asked.	Quae numquam quaesivit.
Well yes in this.	Etiam in hoc bene.
I was always too scared.	Semper etiam vix fui.
But that's no problem now.	Sed id nunc nulla.
We can't stop thinking.	Non possumus prohibere cogitas.
He is talking about this but there is no plan.	De hoc loquitur sed non est consilium.
And I saw so.	Et vidi ita.
Now you can do it!	Nunc agere potes!.
That is nothing.	Quod nihil est.
But that's how.	Sed id quam quam.
I don't see you have.	Non video te habere.
and wanted to give dinner.	et cenam dare vellet.
all at once.	Omnes simul.
We can't find it.	Non possumus sic invenire .
Well it's good.	Bene est bonum.
I can never do it.	Numquam facere possum.
I know you are one.	Scio te unum esse.
That's totally different.	Id prorsus aliud est.
I'm not sick of it.	Male ex eo non sum.
Do you like it?	Tibi placet?.
Just tell me where.	Modo dic ubi.
Who is it possible? 	Qui fieri potest?
but I can say one thing.	sed unum dicere possum.
Yes, as has been said.	Etiam ut dictum est.
I wanted to come home.	Domum venire volui.
But that's not the same thing.	Ut non ipsum nisi.
She was already at home.	Illa iam domi erat.
This will be different, which is for sure.	Hoc aliud erit, quod certe est.
He knew very little.	Parum sciebat.
he thought.	putavit.
And forgot what to do.	Et oblitus est quid facere.
But neither is he at all.	Sed nec ille nulla.
He wasn't what he used to be.	Non erat ille esse solebat.
I am not from you.	non sum a te.
I heard nothing.	Nihil audivi.
She seems much better, but wants to see you again.	Multo melius illa videtur, sed iterum te videre vult.
It's still early here.	Hic adhuc mane est.
Police said it was him.	Aliquam dictum ipsum erat.
I do not believe	Non credo .
I am going to do this.	Hoc facturus sum.
This thing is today.	Haec res hodie est.
You're getting it now.	Nunc id questus es.
He thinks it's really bad for you.	Vere malum est vobis cogitat.
So I told you.	Sic ego dixi vobis.
He said not that much.	Non quod multa dixit.
To do as he pleases.	Facere ut velit.
That's not very hard.	Id ipsum non difficile.
It's really only one day.	Est vere unus tantum dies.
For he was.	Erat enim.
Never be the same again.	Numquam idem iterum.
We're not home anymore.	Non sumus amplius domum.
But not before.	Sed non aliquam ante.
What was, was.	Quid erat, erat.
You told us to talk about it.	Dixisti nos de eo loqui.
He had so much time.	Tempus tantum habuit.
It was a good question, really.	Bona quaestio fuit, vere.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
Look where we are tonight.	Vide ubi hac nocte sumus.
They are very likely.	Verisimile sunt.
there was not one.	non fuit unus.
But it is great.	Magna sed.
Now it was not.	Nunc non erat.
With this being said, this is not for all.	Cum hoc dictum, hoc non sit omnibus.
It was probably his.	Verisimiliter eius fuit.
When it's next.	Cum proximo est.
It is me but not mine.	Est mihi, sed non est meum.
But always, always the same.	Sed semper, semper idem.
And rightly indeed.	Et recte quidem.
That's great, that's for you.	Id magna est, id pro.
Nothing like us.	Nihil nobis simile.
Maybe there is more.	Fortasse plus est.
and left her alone.	et solus reliquit eam.
Yours is what you did right.	Tuum est quod recte fecisti.
Do your job.	Tuum fac officium.
It won't be easy for you.	Nec facile erit tibi.
It is a great question.	Magna quaestio est.
I wanted to be good.	bonum esse volui.
He said well, tell me what you know.	Bene dixit, dic quod scis.
And here something.	Et hic aliquid.
All in all, he said.	Omnino dixit.
Hardly or none at all.	Vel vix nulla.
But it is true, no one really knows.	Sed verum est, nemo vere scit.
I only met yesterday morning.	Tantum heri mane occurrit.
It always does me.	Is me agit, semper habet.
You know what it must be.	Scis quod ita debet esse.
There was almost nothing.	Nihil fere erat.
I really wanted to do it over dinner.	Ego vere per cenam facere vellem.
Time doesn't seem to be.	Tempus non videtur esse.
I think he probably did.	Probabiliter fecisse puto.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
He saw for sure.	Vidit certe.
He never met.	Numquam occurrit ille.
No need for sure.	Non opus est, certe.
Be prepared.	Paratus sit.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
Not nearly.	Non fere.
Just make sure you're fine.	Iustus es bene facit certus.
So this was what he was.	Sic hoc erat quod erat.
we all got it.	Omnes obtinuit.
But he knew it was not so.	Sciebat autem non ita esse.
Well, it's easy.	Bene, facile est.
Now you really like me.	Nunc vere amo me.
He wasn't sure why, but he did.	Non erat certus quare, sed fecit.
Evil is evil.	Malum est malum.
Do what he says.	Fac quod dicit.
I know one thing.	unum scio.
He knew all this.	Hoc totum sciebat.
Unless, not.	Nisi, non.
and he went away.	et abiit.
Or like something at all.	Vel ut aliquid omnino.
Do not do too much.	Ne quid nimis.
I heard nothing about it before or after.	Nihil de eo ante vel post audivi.
I'm not so sure it will be.	Non sum ita certus erit.
This is mine for lunch, so I know nothing here.	Hoc est meum ad prandium, ut nihil hic novi.
I am astonished at you.	Miror te.
But that is not at all.	Sed id est omnino.
Certainly where it began.	Certe ubi incepit.
May it be for all.	Sit omnibus.
It was pretty loud.	Satis magna erat.
I just forgot.	Tantum oblitus sum.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
Today they are not.	Hodie non sunt.
It can be done, a.	Possit, a.
I have nothing	Nihil habeo .
I can find nothing wrong.	Nihil mali invenire possum.
You can't stay.	Manere non potes.
How hard is it?.	Quam difficile est ?.
Yes, that's a great idea.	Etiam id dictum magna.
And there is another.	Et aliud est.
This is my plan.	Hoc est consilium meum.
I have never heard of him.	numquam ab eo audivi.
He didn't want to be here.	Noluit hic esse.
Yes, we can.	Ita, possumus.
At least got it now.	Nunc certe obtinuit.
My bedroom.	Cubiculum meum.
You don't need to know what it is.	Non debes scire quid sit.
I need it.	Mihi opus est.
Look now, it is still.	Vide modo, adhuc est.
I don't like this.	Hoc non placet.
To believe in themselves.	Credere sibi.
He did more.	Plus fecit.
Not the same, but similar.	Non idem, sed similis.
Please call me out.	Me ex velit.
that's where it started.	id est ubi incepit.
You think you do.	Putas te facere.
How	Quomodo.
Never do anything except.	Numquam aliquid nisi.
But who was it?	Sed quis erat.
It's for good.	Est ad bonum.
No one said this, but was sure.	Nemo hoc dixit, sed certus fuit.
But he is gone.	Sed abiit.
It's generally really good.	Vere bonum est fere.
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
You had to like it.	Tu quoque ut placet.
I was at home.	domi essem.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
That which .	Id quod .
i don't know if it is possible.	nescio si fieri potest.
But neither was he from.	Sed nec erat ex.
It was a great story.	Aliquam a erat magna.
Good things are about him.	Bona sunt de illo.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
I don't have to stay here.	Hic manere non habeo.
From the man.	Ex vir.
I only know his first name.	Primum nomen eius tantum scio.
Maybe both?	Forsitan utrumque?
Or, but it is.	Vel sed est.
You're just speaking.	Iustus es loqui.
The thing is gone.	Res abiit.
There is nothing here.	Nihil hic est.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
Even those who never get loud.	Etiam qui numquam magna ut.
Not there for sure.	Non ibi certe.
I am sure.	Certus sum.
I am not surprised by this.	Non miror hoc.
Not that you like it.	Non, quod placet.
My father never understood it.	Pater numquam intellexit id.
Nothing more has been said.	Nihil amplius dictum est.
You have already done that.	Id te iam fecisse dixisti.
This is how and why.	Haec quomodo et quare.
I have not been there.	Non ibi fui.
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
but I will say this.	hoc tamen dicam.
This certainly is.	Hic certe est.
For he did not know and never asked this.	Nesciebat enim et numquam hoc quaesivit.
I want to be there.	ibi esse volo.
Certainly you have this.	Certe hoc habes.
This is enough.	Hoc satis est.
I know this.	Id scio.
And you know, not even that.	Et tu scis, ne illud quidem.
If that is.	Si id est.
I want you from me.	Te volo a me.
I could not see you.	Te videre non potui.
No one is better.	Nemo melius.
But you are not.	Sed non es.
Maybe that's been said before.	Aliquam id dictum ante.
I made my way.	iter feci.
He did not want to be there.	Ibi esse nolebat.
He probably saw something.	Probabiliter aliquid vidit.
It seems fixed for a long time.	Certum videtur multum temporis.
You can do nothing.	Nihil potes.
None in this article except.	Nulla in dictum nisi.
I didn't think to say it before.	Dicere non puto ante.
WATER.	A QUIS.
It is probably better to know.	Probabile est melius scire.
i was never scared.	vix eram numquam.
Money is not easy.	Pecuniam non facile.
He also made one for himself.	Sibi quoque unum fecit.
But there was no time.	Sed non tempus erat.
These things have made me a great force.	Haec me magna vis fecit.
I didn't know what it was.	Nesciebam quid esset.
It was hard to do, though.	Difficile erat facere, sed.
It's never going to happen.	Numquam futurum est.
I haven't seen her since that time.	Non vidi eam ex illo tempore.
He was my husband.	Erat vir meus.
I want to know you.	Scire te volo.
Perhaps that was also true.	Forsitan id quoque verum fuit.
But something else was done.	Sed aliud factum est.
But not really.	Sed non vere.
But not for it.	Sed non enim.
I don't need you.	Non opus est vobis.
That made me do it again.	Quod me fecit, ut faciam iterum.
I guess that's a thing.	Suspicor id aliquid.
But he was like him.	Sed erat ut ipsum.
The teacher is also a man like you.	Magister est etiam homo, sicut tu.
I hope to see him again this year!!!!	Spero eum iterum videre hoc anno!!!!.
It was a pretty good job.	Satis erat officium.
But he did nothing.	Sed nihil fecit.
But better than nothing.	Sed melius quam nihil.
The job has not been done.	Officium non est factum.
If you really want to know.	Si vere scire vis.
I never met.	Numquam occurrit.
Or as one himself.	Vel ut unum ipsum.
But these are pretty good.	Sed haec satis bona sunt.
You should get along with them.	Una cum illa debes accipere.
He already knows me.	Me iam novit.
That's late.	Quod sero factum est.
In who is nothing.	In quis enim nisi.
No that's great.	Nulla id magna.
This is not so.	Non ita est hoc.
perhaps he had.	fortasse habuit.
Only you can.	Tantum potes.
No one even knew his name.	Nemo etiam nomen eius sciebat.
I hope to find you there.	Spero te ibi invenire.
Where do you want to go.	Quo vis ire.
But the work is not so difficult.	Sed opus non est ita difficile.
It was not, he knew.	Non esset, sciebat.
That is so.	Id ita est.
He went to it.	Abiit ad illud.
Certainly.	Certe.
That was bad for us.	Quod malum nobis esset.
home	in domum suam.
I do well.	Bene facio.
It's one to be with you.	Suus 'unus erit tibi.
Maybe even he was out.	Aliquam vel erat ex.
But nothing could be done about this now.	Sed de hoc nunc nihil fieri potuit.
Now I see that both are somehow.	Nunc video quod utrumque est aliquo modo.
But certainly he is just.	Sed certe iustus est .
We are all.	Nos omnes sumus.
You do everything by yourself.	Tu per te omnia facis.
It was easy.	Facile erat.
You can't do this.	Hoc facere non potes.
He knew what was to be done.	Sciebat quid faciendum esset.
He did not ask of him.	Non ex eo quaesivit.
I did not know what could be done.	quid hoc fieri posset nesciebam.
Can someone help me with the problem?.	Forsitan aliquis me adiuvet ad quaestionem ?.
And you know, probably it was.	Et scis, verisimiliter fuit.
And he was certain there.	Erat autem ibi certum.
It is important to say that.	Aliquam sit amet dictum quam.
But it is very probable.	Sed valde probabile est.
Now, never will.	Nunc, numquam velit.
Now it is time.	Modo sit tempus.
Yes, but it was him.	Etiam sed ipsum erat.
If you are good, you are good.	Si bonus es, bonus es.
She can't stop.	Illa prohibere non potest.
i'm good this way.	Im bonus hoc modo.
She told him what it was.	Non indicavit ei quid esset.
I made a name yesterday.	Ego heri nomen feci.
It was the same with my job.	Idem erat cum officium meum.
I told you why not.	Dixi tibi cur non.
Which makes me wonder.	Quae me miror.
He does not say we believe.	Non dicit nos credere.
None of the above.	Nulla in dictum est.
We did a good thing here.	Bona res hic nos fecit.
And that's what.	Id autem.
It's good to see you.	Suus 'bonus te videre.
as it seems.	ut videtur.
Really talk to you.	Vere tecum loqui.
There was no such thing.	Nulla id erat erat.
It's okay by me.	Sic bene est a me.
You want .	Vis .
Now there was not any.	Nunc nec aliquam erat.
Well we're there.	Bene ibi sumus.
There is no need here.	Non opus est hic.
Yes, it was not great.	Etiam non erat magna.
No as before now.	Nulla ut ante nunc.
Not bad either.	Sed male vel.
All in all it needs to be better.	Omnino opus est ut melius.
There will be a lot of work ahead of us.	Multo opus erit ante nos.
This ought to be done.	Hoc fieri debet.
Yes it is what you are.	Ita est quod es.
Live everything and what you have.	Omnia vivere, et quid habes.
Yes, but it was great.	Etiam sed magna erat.
I looked in the room.	Vidi in cubiculum.
It was not a bad thing.	Male non erat.
It was not enough.	Non satis erat.
But that's what you want.	Sed id ipsum quod vis.
I would like to.	Vellem.
It was done before.	Ante factum est.
Not a good way to go.	Non bene iter.
They are not men.	Non sunt homines.
It was very hard.	Erat autem valde difficile.
not before.	non ante.
Yes it is however.	Ita est tamen.
It was this morning.	Hoc mane erat.
I know the truth well.	Scio verum bene.
Was .	Erat .
The first is not really true.	Primum non est vere verum.
But nothing else.	Sed non aliud.
It was not what he was unwilling to do.	Non erat quod facere noluit.
But there is nothing that is not to-morrow morning.	Sed nihil est quod non cras usque mane.
Find yourself.	Invenire te ipsum.
I do a lot of facial expressions.	Multum facio vultus.
Maybe it was time.	Aliquam id tempus erat.
But perhaps now you know how to go.	Sed fortasse nunc, scis ire.
It would be bad for me.	Malum esset a me.
No one knew how much.	Nemo, quantum sciebat.
I've heard one thing.	Audivi unum.
But this is not always.	Sed hoc non est semper.
I don't really like myself.	Non vere amo ut ipse.
Certainly never.	Numquam certe.
You'll never know when you need it.	Numquam scire debes, cum tibi opus sit.
Now you are making your decision.	Nunc tuum consilium facis.
Certainly, great.	Certe, magna.
He thought he was.	Putabat se esse.
Or perhaps this was more.	Vel forte plus hoc fuit.
It won't be too hard.	Non erit difficile.
He was still there.	Erat adhuc ibi.
It's too late, however.	Sero tamen.
This is certain.	Hoc certum est.
How well it is for you.	Ut bene sit tibi.
I don't feel right.	Non recte sentio.
No one seems to know why.	Cur nemo scire videtur.
He refused to speak to me.	Noluit mihi dicere.
I don't mean you.	Non vult te.
You might not get one.	Fortasse non unum.
There was none in none.	Nulla in nulla erat.
It is not hard to find.	Non est difficile invenire.
I don't know, man, said he.	Nescio, homo, dixit.
He's finally here.	Hic tandem est.
he was someone for a while.	esset autem aliquis ad tempus.
If it is so.	Si ita sit.
This assistance is not available.	Hoc auxilium non est.
I don't need a hug.	Non opus est amet.
I made up for dinner.	Ego feci usque ad cenam.
This is what he does.	Hoc est quod facit.
i think one thing is good.	Puto unum bonum.
This was that man.	Haec fuit ille vir.
Too much for me.	Nimium me.
But not from yet.	Sed non ex sed.
It is important that you love yourself.	Aliquam sit amet quam te ipsum.
If there is need, be prepared.	Si opus est, ut paratus sit.
It is still up to the point.	Adhuc est, ad rem.
Well almost everyone.	Bene fere omnes.
You are always.	Tu semper es.
No one ever asked me to do it.	Nemo umquam me facere.
I think you are going to see him.	Ire ad eum puto.
Before, after.	Ante, post.
Why do you want to go there.	Quid vis illuc ire.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
But it was only.	Sed non nisi erat.
That's it for tomorrow.	Cras id enim.
I mean nothing other than, but that's out of it.	Ut sit nihil quam, id sed ex.
What, he thought.	Quid, putabat.
Now we can see the problem.	Iam quaestionem videre possumus.
That was what I used to be.	Illa erat quae solebat esse.
It is important that it is.	Aliquam sit amet quam est.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
But he would not.	Noluit autem.
He could not leave so much.	Tantum relinquere non potuit.
But perhaps that is good.	Sed fortasse id bonum est.
There is yes or no problem.	Est etiam vel nulla quaestio est.
He was not yet sure.	Nondum certus erat.
So it is.	Ita est.
But it was the same.	Sed sed ipsum erat.
I see you.	Te video.
You know that I just don't have it.	Scis quod hoc tantum non habet.
It was a great school.	Magna schola sed.
I have not seen you.	Non vidi te.
I certainly .	Ego certe .
I'd like to think that's true.	Libet cogitare id verum esse.
Can't wait to act too quickly.	Nescit nimium cito agere.
He willed	Voluit .
It will be so.	Sic erit.
I never tried it.	Numquam id conatus.
Certainly I can do it.	Certe possum facere.
We're on the road.	Iter sumus.
To get this out.	Ut id ex.
I can't talk yet.	Non possum dicere adhuc.
Not long.	Non diu.
One thing soon.	Unum quidem mox.
Well I think.	Bene puto.
But no one from.	Sed quis nulla ex.
To go to work.	Ad officium, ut.
I am ready again.	Iterum paratus sum.
Maybe it was here.	Forte ita fuit hic.
He said this.	Hoc dixit.
I don't doubt anything about him.	Non dubito quid- de illo.
He has not.	Non habet.
I didn't know you would be.	Nesciebam fore te.
But it is important.	Aliquam sit amet nisi.
But we are really sick.	Sed nobis vere male.
He didn't want that one.	Nolebat id unum.
The time has come now.	Tempus nunc venit.
.	.
But it was not either.	Sed vel non erat.
and probably has.	et probabiliter habet.
Do what you want, when you want.	Fac quod vis, quando vis.
He does not do so easily.	Ita facile non facit.
It's his bedroom.	Cubiculum eius est.
So it is.	Ita est.
But something else.	Sed aliud quid.
And the father.	Et pater.
I don't really mean.	Non vere vult.
But that was nothing.	Sed id erat nisi.
I doubt that he does.	Dubito quod facit.
Look at what you've done.	Vide quid feceris.
But that's what you are.	Sed id quod es.
It was easy to believe.	Facile erat credere.
I know what to say.	Scio quid dicam.
We have all these things.	Haec omnia habemus.
Play along.	Ludere per.
Which indeed is so.	Quod quidem ita est.
To say for sure.	Dicere certe ei.
It's in you.	Est in te.
And now it's going to happen.	Et nunc futurum est.
Yes, but he will, he will.	Etiam sed velit velit.
But not all are bad.	Sed non omnes mali.
See .	Videre .
I did not know.	Nesciebam.
Which way it was done.	Quod ita factum est.
But no no no.	Sed non nulla amplius.
No one wanted to know anything.	Nemo aliquid scire voluit.
And that's enough.	Et satis.
to stay or not to stay.	manere vel non manere.
It has to be.	Habet esse.
You're too lonely here.	Nimis solus hic es.
i knew this pretty well.	hoc satis bene scivi.
And this can never be but evil.	Quod numquam potest esse nisi malum.
Now who was that.	Nunc quis quam erat.
But it was not enough.	Parum fuit, sed.
to see you win.	ut video vincere.
I met him.	Habui cum eo.
Which is not seen.	Quod non videtur.
He saw enough, he knew.	Vidit satis scivit.
He knows it too.	Novit etiam illud.
He would not come.	Noluit venire.
Please talk now.	Loqui nunc velit.
And that is that.	Et id est id.
I thought this was good.	Hoc bonum esse putabam.
It's about time it seems.	Est de tempore videtur.
Or it was something.	Vel erat aliquid.
This is one thing to live.	Hoc unum vivere.
it was too late.	Sero esset.
Tell me if it does.	Dic si facit.
Do something for him.	Fac aliquid ei.
We don't have to talk.	Loqui non habemus.
for I could never go without her.	numquam enim sine illa ire potui.
I don't do anything.	Non aliquid.
I wanted to be alone.	Solus esse volui.
He does not come.	Non venit.
He ought to be, to him to that.	Debet esse, illum ad id eum.
But up to this point.	Sed huc usque.
Not one father wanted to hear him.	Non unus pater eum audire voluit.
Nothing to do with yourself.	Nihil ut ipsum et.
Stay away from him.	Mane ex eo.
Nothing has yet been done.	Nihil adhuc factum est.
I'm not there already.	Jam non sum ibi.
I would like to see.	Videre vellem.
I told him about you.	Dixi ei de te.
Maybe he's coming to him.	Forsitan is ad se venit.
I forgot something.	Oblitus sum quid.
All these things are good.	Haec omnia bona sunt.
I hope it will be.	Spero fore.
TO YOU	TU AD.
But neither was he from.	Sed nec erat ex.
This is so.	Hoc ita sit.
.	.
he did not know what, and why.	nesciebat quid, quare.
But there was no time.	Sed non erat est.
It was fine, though.	Bene erat, sed.
We cannot do this.	Hoc facere non possumus.
It is really good.	Vere bonum est.
She thought he was doing the right thing.	Putavit se rem recte agere.
I've always wanted you.	Ego te semper volui.
But before him.	Sed id ipsum ante.
I want to find it.	Volo eam invenire.
Can you talk to me about something.	Tu mihi aliquid loqui.
Tomorrow to save save.	Cras ut nisi nisi.
He wanted me to talk about him.	Voluit me de eo dicere.
This was what he wanted to do.	Hoc erat quod facere voluit.
It will be better.	Melius erit.
but he refused.	noluit tamen.
Nothing knows much.	Nihil scit multum.
As it was said.	Ut dictum erat.
That never happened.	Id numquam est.
He did not understand.	Non intellexit.
It is certain, this has been said.	Certum est, hoc dictum est.
I just think about everything.	Ego iustus cogitare de omnibus.
Right now, he has seen it himself, perhaps.	Recte etiam nunc vidit ipse suo, fortasse.
Call me if you want.	Me si vis.
He was alone.	Solus erat.
he thought.	putavit.
Nothing else can really be done.	Nihil aliud vere fieri potest.
He loves to travel.	Iter amat.
Not so much, that's all.	Noli tantum, id totum est.
She was always so sure about herself.	Ita semper de se certus fuit.
forgot about everything.	Oblitus est de omnibus.
No one knows us there.	Nemo nos ibi scit.
yes it is not said.	Etiam non dictum est.
But that's all day long.	Sed id totum diem.
There's not only time.	Ibi non solum tempus.
Maybe not save that.	Aliquam non nisi quam.
I never got it.	Numquam obtinuit eam.
What about.	Quod de.
He treats himself.	Se ipsum agit.
I don't want him to know.	Nolo eum scire.
He wanted this so badly.	Hoc tam male voluit.
Talk to someone.	Loqui ad aliquem.
He could say nothing.	Nihil potuit dicere.
We have enough money.	Satis pecuniae habemus.
He likes to do something.	Velit aliquid.
At first she thought it was there.	Ibi primum putavit esse.
Nothing else was needed.	Nihil aliud opus erat.
Great amount.	Magna tantum.
This is!.	Hic est!.
You can do this if you want.	Hoc facere potes si vis.
Nothing seems to be here.	Nihil hic esse videtur.
i thought so badly.	ut male putabam.
Just for me.	Sicut pro me.
I knew, and I could see nothing wrong.	Scivi, et nihil mali potui videre.
We have enough money.	Satis pecuniae habemus.
You're done to date.	Ad diem es factum.
I thought a lot about this.	Multum de hoc cogitavi.
It doesn't have to be.	Non habet esse.
Look for something like this for me.	Vide aliquid simile hoc meum.
You can leave me here.	Hic me relinquere potes.
This seems to work for me.	Hoc mihi opus videtur.
We don't have time to go now.	Non tempus habemus ut iam.
Never let him down either.	Numquam vel illum.
He is gone.	Abiit.
I want to know if you like.	Volo scire si tibi placet.
Not better than you.	Non melius quam tu.
He speaks of himself as evil.	Se in malum loquitur.
This was my first time here.	Hoc mihi primum hic fuit.
I need some help with someone.	Auxilio aliquo opus est cum aliquo.
It was easy for me.	Mihi facile fuit.
I think it's good.	Puto bonum.
I could not understand.	Non potui intelligere.
They are in and before.	Sunt in et ante.
That's what I'm doing.	Id quod me facere.
It can be fixed.	Certum esse potest.
I didn't say anything else to him.	Non dixi ei aliud.
I need to know why you're here.	Mihi opus est scire cur hic sis.
This home had something for everyone.	Hic domi aliquid omnibus habuit.
You are only for me.	Tu modo ad me.
People don't like it.	Homines non placet.
Maybe it was both.	Fortasse utrumque erat.
That seems to be a lot of things.	Quod multum videtur.
And you really do it.	Et vere eam fac.
When everything is great.	Cum omnia magna.
Right sorry.	Recte paenitet nos.
See what we need.	Vide quid a nobis opus sit.
Even now it was not.	Etiam non nunc erat.
As you like.	Ut tibi placet.
Find out what you want.	Id te invenire.
I never wanted something like this to happen.	Numquam aliquid simile hoc fieri voluit.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
That was his name.	Erat nomen eius.
I didn't think you would.	Non putabam te fore.
He has not .	Non habet .
Something to think about.	Aliquid cogitare.
But it is not always.	Sed nec semper est.
Look this way.	Hoc modo vide.
It is not for you.	Non est tibi.
I want to see you so badly.	Volo te videre tam male.
Lunch would be better.	Prandium melius esset.
It was very likely.	Verisimile fuit.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
Certainly nothing new.	Certe nihil novi.
Why? 	Quare?
I was scared, but not anymore.	vix eram, sed non amplius.
But in was out.	Sed in erat ex.
It was time and time.	Erat tempore et.
Good for me.	Bonum mihi.
There is no reason for me to speak with him.	Non est quod mihi cum illo loqui.
I heard enough.	Satis audivi.
Maybe it was my name.	Fortasse nomen erat meum.
No, not.	Non, non.
He does the whole thing.	Totum facit.
I just can't do it.	Ego iustus facere non possum.
I don't even know your real name.	Ne quidem nomen tuum verum novi.
I love this post.	Post hoc amo.
So all at once, there.	Sic omnes simul, ibi.
and the day has come.	et dies venit.
He does nothing.	Nihil facit.
I have them all.	Habeo omnes.
I don't need that at all.	Non opus est ut omnino.
I believe rightly.	recte credo.
I have something to say to you.	Habeo tibi aliquid dicere.
But there was no time.	Sed tempus non erat.
Almost anyone.	Fere quis.
You told him where.	Tu ei ubi.
Which one is the nearest.	Quae proxima est.
I want to be a good guy.	Volo bonum esse guy.
He said all this.	Hoc totum dixit.
This is true and not true.	Hoc est verum et non verum.
So again	Sic iterum .
I know why you did it.	Scio cur tu id feceris.
Say what you want, he does his job.	Dic quod vis, suum facit officium.
But I've never seen it before.	Sed id numquam ante.
Nothing he could do.	Nihil potuit facere.
He is not talking to me.	Is mihi non loquitur.
We don't have time to do so.	Non habemus tempus id.
Even more than that.	Etiam nec ipsum quam.
He couldn't even stop now.	Ne nunc quidem prohibere potuit.
He asked to say something else.	Quaesivit aliquid aliud dicere.
Yes, there was no time.	Etiam nec tempus erat.
Maybe this is something to do with it.	Fortasse hoc aliquid ad rem.
I am alone in this journey.	Solus hoc iter sum.
This was yours.	Tuum hoc fuit.
You also.	Tu quoque.
I would not know any more.	amplius scire nolui.
I don't know how to do this.	Nescio quomodo hoc faciam.
And certainly he says.	Et certe dicit.
May it be that.	Sit ut ut.
Always and again.	Semper, et iterum.
I want you to go.	Volo te ire.
He is still in it.	In eo adhuc est.
Now it is.	Iam is est.
Go to the office and be there every morning.	Ad officium, et ibi omnes mane.
see what you have.	habes quod vide.
These are great events.	Magna haec sunt certe.
But you can't stop.	Sed non potes prohibere.
Tomorrow was always before.	Cras semper ante erat.
You're on time.	Tu in tempore es.
You'll never go there anymore.	Numquam illuc ire amplius.
and it was scarcely possible.	et vix erat.
But he does not do anything with him.	Sed nihil cum eo non facit.
To do so please.	Ut id velit.
You can certainly do this if you want.	Hoc certe facere potes si vis.
Yes that is.	Etiam id, est.
I like it a lot.	Mihi multum placet.
It was not done.	Non factum est.
I tried to love him.	Conatus est ipsum.
Or at least not all.	Vel certe non omnes.
You only need to believe in yourself.	Tantum debes credere in te.
I love you very much.	Valde amo.
That's who you are now.	Ut quis ipsum nunc.
It has to do well.	Habet bene.
It was important to be honest.	Aliquam sit amet erat est.
No one could speak.	Nemo dicere potuit.
Mary was behind him.	Maria erat post eum.
make him speak.	fac eum loqui.
You do the same thing too.	Idem tu quoque.
It is also very important.	Etiam magna ipsum.
.	.
No, not unless he wants.	Nulla non nisi velit.
That's no problem.	Id nulla res est.
But I don't have time now.	Sed non tempus nunc.
I guess it could be.	Suspicor posse.
He could do it.	Facere posset.
What I know no one can know.	Quod scio nemo potest scire.
Next year, perhaps, perhaps not.	Proximo anno, fortasse, fortasse non.
Do what you want.	Facere vis.
But that's the job.	Sed id officium est.
He made his way and traveled again.	Iter fecit iter et iterum.
It was not the first time.	Non primum factum est.
I couldn't believe it at all.	Omnino non potui credere.
Time is man.	Tempus est homo.
I didn't tell you everything.	Non dixi tibi omnia.
I went to the office that morning.	Illa mane ad officium non abiit.
Which is absolutely nothing.	Quod omnino nihil est.
we cannot win.	vincere non possumus.
It was from him.	Esset ex eo.
That would be bad.	Malum id fore.
which I think is quite probable.	quod satis probabile puto.
And certainly all things are good.	Et certe omnia bona sunt.
But there is more.	Sed plus est.
I told him.	ei dixi.
Her father is sick enough, you know.	Pater suus male satis est, tu scis.
I heard how.	Audivi quomodo.
But that was not true.	Quod tamen non fuit.
No one knows she's ever done it.	Nemo illa scit umquam fecisse.
But he said.	Sed dixit.
This is gonna be fun.	Hic sit amet sit amet.
Now he knew for sure.	Nunc pro certo sciebat.
It's up to her.	Est ad eam.
This was not yet.	Hoc nondum erat.
i'm lucky.	Sum felix.
I have seen both.	utrumque vidi.
That's when it occurred to me.	Id cum mihi occurrit.
We need to think about it now.	Nunc de nobis opus est cogitare.
This has been done.	Hoc factum est.
What shall I do? 	Quid faciam?
And if not .	Et si non .
To always believe in yourself.	Ut in semper ipsum.
He tried to help the matter.	Ille rem adiuvare conatus est.
We don't like it.	Non placet nobis.
It seems you don't buy.	Videtur non emere.
Certainly I did.	Certe feci.
But he still has it.	Sed tamen habet.
I was late to work.	Sero ad opus fui.
We have three.	Tres habemus.
Even if it is your first time.	Etiam sit amet tempus nisi.
I wish indeed.	Utinam quidem.
I will tell you this.	Dicam tibi hoc.
Not everybody.	Non omnibus.
It's not exactly a good thing.	Non est res prorsus bona.
Yes it is fun saying out.	Etiam sit amet dictum ex.
Her father went to her.	Abiit ad eam pater.
Has a job.	Habet officium.
And it could be done.	Et fieri potuit.
He was still here.	Hic tamen erat.
She can't say anything.	Quae dicere non potest.
I can do it too.	id quoque possum.
That is.	Id est.
That's how it is.	Id ut est.
I am not talking about that.	Non sum de illo.
It's not long at all.	Non diu est omnino.
What shall I do? 	Quid faciam?
This will be for sure.	Hic certe erit.
Why is it???	Cur est???.
I can't leave you.	Te relinquere non possum.
I am so sorry.	Ita sum paenitet.
Excellent in this way.	Optime hoc modo.
There is still work to be done.	Est opus adhuc faciendum.
I wanted to tell you myself.	Ipse tibi volui dicere.
This should be done.	Hoc debet fieri.
I hope not tonight.	Spero non hac nocte.
People need to see this film.	Homines amet necesse est hoc videre.
But it was only said.	Sed non dictum nisi.
I know a lot about him.	Scio multa de eo.
We can do this now.	Facere possumus hoc modo.
I really don't want to be alone right now.	Ego vere nunc solus esse nolo.
It was from the Police.	Aliquam a erat erat.
I'll tell you why.	Dicam quare.
So it was done.	Ita factum est.
Well done.	Bene factum est.
It will never be the same.	Numquam idem futurum est.
I've been through it all.	Fui per totum.
Nothing to do.	Nihil facere.
Which he does quite well.	Quod satis bene facit.
But no one from.	Sed quis nulla ex.
But that's how often.	Sed id saepe quam.
But it is not.	Sed non est est.
I know not enough.	Parum scio.
This is quite probable.	Hoc satis probabile.
I don't think anything.	Non aliquid cogitare.
You're here in the morning.	Hic mane es.
I am astonished at that.	Miror quod.
But that's only what.	Sed id nisi quam.
I just don't see.	Ego iustus non video.
I can't get to him.	Ad eum non possum.
i never knew anything else.	numquam aliud sciebam.
It was going to be okay.	Bene futurum erat.
But we are there.	Sed ibi sumus.
Well, without us.	Bene, sine nobis.
Everything would be video.	Omnia video fore.
Who wants.	Velit quis.
Again he does it.	Iterum id facit.
Don't listen to me.	Noli me audire.
But it is not so.	Sed non ita est.
That's the whole class.	Totum illud genus est.
Just as important.	Tam magna.
You have everything yet.	Habes omnia adhuc.
That's what he said.	Sic est quod dixit.
This really is something.	Hoc vere est aliquid.
And there he is.	Et ibi est.
I wanted to see that dog.	Canem illum videre volui.
He was also very happy.	Etiam sit amet erat.
He understood her well.	Bene intellexit eam.
But not tonight.	Sed non hac nocte.
I'm sorry about that for sure.	De illo certe me paenitet.
He said that he only believed me.	Dixit se non credere nisi mihi.
This class is pretty much everything.	Hoc genus fere omnia.
You haven't seen a good morning.	Non tu mane bonum videri.
You don't want to know.	Et scire non vis.
Something else.	Aliquid aliud.
He likes the same thing.	Velit idem.
But he cannot go.	Sed ire non potest.
It was not said.	Nec dictum sit.
But that is almost.	Sed id est fere.
That's what time it was.	Ut id tempus quam.
I really didn't know what to do.	Ego vere nesciebam quid facerem.
But that's the same thing too.	Sed id ipsum etiam.
Maybe you should.	Forsitan ut.
He said almost anything else.	Fere aliquid aliud dixit.
That's all and everything.	Id per omnes et omnia.
But it was not enough.	Sed parum erat.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
I have not seen it happen.	Fieri non vidi.
It won't be again tonight.	Iterum hac nocte non esse.
Thus he thought.	Sic putavit.
He came to us for help.	Venit ad nos in auxilium.
But it was only said.	Sed non dictum nisi.
I don't love you at all.	Non amo omnino.
But that's too much.	Sed id nimis multa.
It is never too late.	Numquam sero.
There is nothing among us.	Nihil est inter nos.
I don't mean to be.	Non vult esse.
But it does not have it.	Sed sic non habet.
We need it.	Nobis opus est.
This is not bad.	Hoc non est malum.
yes it is not said.	Etiam non dictum est.
I can't say what you can do or I can't.	Dicere non possum quod facere potes vel non possum.
It is also in us.	Etiam in nobis est.
Who was in the game.	In quis erat velit.
What, he did not know.	Quid, nesciebat.
I looked after you.	Vidi post te.
And yet he cannot leave it.	Et tamen eam relinquere non potest.
I wonder if that's the thing.	Miror si quid ad rem.
I wanted to think.	Cogitare volui.
You know my work.	Meum opus tu scis.
It was good to go when needed.	Bonum erat ut, cum opus esset.
It's not so hard.	Non est ita difficile.
I can't talk anymore.	Non possum amplius dicere.
So right now indeed.	Ita recte et nunc quidem.
I am you.	ego vos.
Maybe you need to see this.	Fortasse hoc vide debes.
I hope you're doing well.	Spero te bene.
Thank you very much.	Optime multum.
Find something.	Invenire aliquid.
I think it is pretty great.	Puto esse satis magna.
Don't do this!	Noli hoc facere!.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Noluit loqui ad me.
She just wasn't much.	Illa tantum non erat multum.
I hope you know what I mean.	Spero te scire quid sit.
I'll tell you why.	Ego tibi cur dicam.
That night there was none.	Nocte id nulla.
Nothing has been done at any time.	Nihil aliquo tempore factum est.
I have something to say to you today.	Habeo tibi aliquid hodie dicere.
I'd like to be there to see you.	Libet ibi esse videre.
Not easy, though.	Non facile, sed.
He does a lot of things.	Multum facit.
I know for sure.	Vere scio.
I know something about him.	de eo aliquid novi.
It was pretty good before.	Satis erat ante bonum.
I am this .	Sum hoc .
There was no time to think.	Tempus non erat cogitare.
just love to see you.	Iustus amo te videre.
I hope you get this.	Spero te hoc accipere.
We all get more money.	Omnes plus pecuniae.
It was already too late.	Sero iam erat.
And you know, that's right.	Scis et, ut recte.
Maybe it was okay, that's it.	Aliquam bene erat, id illo.
It's time for some ex.	Aliquam per aliquam ex.
But it was time.	Tempus erat, sed.
he was only three.	nisi tres erat.
I could not leave him alone.	Eum solum relinquere non potui.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
I'm really not getting behind the question.	Im 'vere non questus post quaestionem.
That was not exactly true.	Quod non erat prorsus verum.
That means there is none.	Ut id nulla est.
Unless you're very happy.	Nisi ipsum sit amet ipsum.
I just can't be that way.	Modo non potest esse illuc.
yet I can't believe it.	adhuc non possum credere.
He was ready to do it today.	Erat hodie facere paratus.
I really like the type of people in it.	Genus vere amo et homines in eo.
He knew that it was not.	Sciebat non esse.
I'm sorry .	Paenitet .
I was a boy.	Puer fui.
Yes, but always said.	Etiam semper dictum nisi.
Now that's just hard to do.	Nunc id solum difficile est facere.
Not just, for sure.	Non modo, certe.
He could not stay here.	Hic manere non potuit.
I see one thing, another, another.	Aliud video, aliud, aliud.
If you want to buy in.	Si vis emere in.
The day is gone.	Dies abiit.
I'm in school, you know.	In schola sum, tu scis.
Nothing seems to be possible about this.	Hoc nihil fieri posse videtur.
But who was before.	Sed quis ante quam.
It makes you want to live.	Vis vivere facit.
There is none.	Nulla est.
You don't have a thing.	Rem non habes.
Travel when you can.	Iter cum potes.
It was the first time for me.	Primum mihi fuit.
But lest he should say it.	Sed ne forte dicit.
But neither was it save.	Sed nec erat nisi.
No one is in you.	Qui te nulla in est.
Nothing else for me.	Nihil aliud ad me.
I can't speak for sure.	Certo loqui non possum.
That's how it was gonna be.	Ut sit amet dictum quam.
I tried again.	Conatus iterum.
Maybe it's both.	Forsitan utrumque est.
But not how great.	Sed non quam magna.
To be honest for you.	Ut sit amet enim.
I did this myself.	Hoc ego ipse feci.
But he thought he knew.	Sed putabat se scire.
This is not seen.	Hoc non videtur.
He saw no evil.	Malum non vidit.
I did not want to believe him.	Nolui ei credere.
We are here to see	Hic sumus videre .
I need help, father.	Auxilio mihi opus est, pater.
I'm not gonna do it.	Non sum amet quam id.
Don't say anything.	Noli quicquam dicere.
OK here's the question.	Bene hic quaestio.
He just can't.	Iustus non potest.
he has done me wrong.	male me fecit.
Now who was out.	Nunc quis ex erat.
Not so.	Non sic.
You can't leave now.	Nunc relinquere non potes.
I don't want to do it too much.	Nolo nimium eam facere.
Who knows what?	Quid, qui novit.
But no more.	Sed non amplius.
We'll be so happy to see you.	Non erit tam felix te videre.
and thus it is still.	et sic adhuc est.
he alone did it.	solus fecit.
He saw not, he understood.	Vidit non intellexit.
Don't let him down.	Ne eum.
I think it's still true.	Puto tamen verum esse.
If you don't like me.	Si non placet mihi.
I watched him play a lot.	Vidi eum multum ludere.
It would be too good to be true.	Esset etiam bonum esse verum.
And certainly it is true.	Et certe verum est.
I don't like it.	Non ut est.
A year or so later.	Anno post illud an.
I would like to believe that she could help her.	Credere volo se posse eam adiuvare.
But he knows well enough.	Sed satis bene novit.
But that was it.	Sed id erat enim.
This could not have been done.	Hoc fieri non potuit.
Why does he say all these things?	Cur haec omnia loquitur.
This could not have been good.	Hoc bonum esse non potuit.
I didn't have it with her.	Non habui, cum illa.
It was a very tense time.	Nimis temporis erat.
I never plan to go to school.	Numquam ad consilium scholam.
Nothing else you need to say.	Nihil aliud tibi opus est dicere.
Look at the truth.	Verum vide.
I certainly don't think so.	Ego certe non puto.
There's absolutely nothing.	Prorsus nihil est ibi.
I have seen too much.	Vidi nimis.
Maybe you too.	Fortasse tu quoque.
I just made, that's all.	Modo factum est, id totum.
But we are not here.	Sed hic non sumus.
It's time for somebody to love him.	Aliquam quis tempus ipsum.
I certainly didn't do it.	Ego certe non fecisti eum.
In order to be non-existent.	In ut nulla erat.
I think we all play.	Puto nos omnes ludere.
I could not have it.	Id habere non potui.
There is so much work.	Tantum opus est.
But this is not per se.	Sed hoc non est per se.
But please try some.	Aliquam velit tamen.
If it is so, so to be.	Quod si ita est, sic esse.
we have , we have .	habemus , habemus .
This is good and bad.	Hoc bonum et malum est.
I'm sorry, I can't help you there.	Paenitet, te ibi adiuvare non potest.
Nothing else is needed.	Nihil aliud opus est.
Meet the man.	Vir occurrit.
I am busy.	occupatus sum.
I think it would be.	fore puto.
i can post it.	post id possum.
But it was only.	Sed non nisi erat.
But that's still some.	Sed id aliquam etiam.
He didn't like it, but he did it.	Noluit ei similis, sed fecit.
I don't really want anything.	Non vere volo aliquid.
May this time be.	Utinam hoc tempus sit.
You just had to go.	Vos iustus erat ut.
But it was not always.	Sed non semper erat.
Maybe he didn't have time.	Forsitan tempus non habuit .
You don't have to talk to me.	Loqui de me non habes.
A job, a job.	A officium, officium.
He gave too little.	Parum dedit.
Maybe he thinks he can live with him.	Forsitan putat se cum eo vivere posse.
Yes and if not.	Etiam et nisi nisi.
But this does not seem to be enough.	Non tamen hoc satis videtur.
We may also know that we don't have enough time.	Possumus etiam scire tempus non satis habere.
I definitely wanted to be happy.	Certo felix esse volui.
But what has been said?	Sed quis dictum est.
You might buy something.	Fortasse aliquid emere.
Maybe that's how great.	Aliquam id magna quam.
Unless it is for you.	Nisi forte tibi.
Me too.	Me quoque.
Nothing at this time.	Hoc tempore nihil.
Well, that's not true at all.	Bene, id omnino verum non est.
He said something to me.	Hoc mihi aliquid dixit.
Like a guy.	Sicut guy.
Got a job.	Obtinuit officium.
I will do the job for you.	Officium faciam vobis.
He also said out loud.	Etiam dictum magna.
I know it's good.	Scio bonum esse.
Maybe it was great.	Aliquam erat magna.
I am not .	Non sum .
He is just the one who appears.	Iustus est qui videtur.
I didn't know what to do.	Nesciebam quid.
We can never really say what a thing is or not.	Numquam vere dicere possumus quid sit res vel non.
Which of the following.	Quae ex.
She'll be working for you.	Illa erit tibi opus.
But this is not why we are here.	Sed hoc non est cur hic sumus.
Her father was looking for her.	Pater eius esset vultus eius.
I will say nothing more.	nihil amplius dicam.
Not that bad.	Non ut malum.
This work is for me.	Hic opus est mihi.
It was never a thing.	Numquam rem.
But this is the same.	Sed hoc ipsum est.
But this does not appear.	Sed hoc non videtur.
Look at him today.	Eum vide hodie.
I need to do better.	Id melius facere debeo.
But it was done.	Sed factum est.
There are still things to do from him.	Adhuc sunt, ut res ab eo.
Her job is not good.	Eius officium non est bonum.
He was not, and he knew it.	Non erat, et ipse scivit.
But it has been said in the past.	In sed dictum ante.
I would like to play next season.	Proximo tempore ludere vellem.
I thought what to say.	Cogitavi quid dicam.
We also have a name.	Nos quoque nomen habemus.
She just didn't know.	Illa modo nesciebat.
There was nothing.	Nihil esset.
It is good.	Bene est.
Are you like .	Esne similis .
But here it is.	Tamen hic esse.
better than you can do.	melius quam potes facere.
It was great to talk.	Loqui magna erat.
Where are you?.	Ubi es?.
That is not necessary.	Quod non est necesse.
Why so, so it has.	Cur sic, sic habet.
day and day	Dies et dies.
I knew what was going to happen.	sciebam quid futurum esset.
No you are not here.	Nulla non hic.
But that, as it seems, is not.	Sed id, ut videtur, non est.
It is also great.	Etiam magna est.
Now this is evil.	Nunc hic malum est.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
Nothing else.	Nihil aliud.
he seemed so happy.	tam felix videbatur.
It is necessary to stop.	Necesse est prohibere.
Never, never.	Numquam, numquam.
It's like she doesn't even know me.	Est illa ne me quidem novit.
I don't know what to say.	Nescio quid dicam.
That's even now.	Id vel nunc.
No it is not.	Nulla non est.
It's his job.	Officium suum est.
I did not so.	non ita feci.
I don't know what it looks like.	Nescio quid etiam simile videtur.
But not soon.	Sed non mox.
Not just her.	Non modo eam.
you have a name.	nomen habes.
He did not know why.	Cur nesciebat.
He likes you.	Velit quam te.
Yes that's out of the game.	Etiam id ex velit.
i'm scared all day.	vix totum diem sum.
I am the same.	Idem ego sum.
Please don't see him.	Quaeso, noli videre eum.
No one here knows what to do.	Hic nemo id facere scit.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
I got up for work in the morning.	Ego mane opus obtinuit.
Unless she could really think about it.	Nisi de illo vere cogitare non posset.
I didn't want to deal with him.	Nolui agere cum illo.
But it looks good.	Sed bonum est vultus.
He has everything at that time.	Habet enim omnia eo tempore.
As it was.	Ut erat.
May it be fun.	Sit id sit amet.
I can say this.	Hoc possum dicere.
Please don't see me again.	Non placet iterum videre.
Yes, that was it.	Ita, quod erat.
He wanted so much in his own way.	Tantum modo suo modo voluit.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
No, but it is said.	Nulla sed dictum est.
Everything was for me.	Mihi omnia erat.
I didn't understand it for a long time.	Non diu intellexit.
But there is no one.	Sed non est quis.
i'm getting	questus sum.
It would seem that this will not happen soon.	Videtur hoc non cito futurum esse.
He understood.	Intellexit.
As in, day after day.	In, sicut, dies.
I don't know what's up too.	Nescio quid nimis.
Really don't like it.	Vere non placet.
But nothing was said except in him.	Sed non nisi in ipsum dictum aliquam.
I don't see much.	Non video multum.
Advice for him.	Consilium pro eo.
This is not true.	Hoc verum non est.
I can buy you whatever you want.	Non possum tibi emere quod vis.
It was great seeing you.	Magna erat cum te.
But he could not do this.	Sed hoc facere non potuit.
This was not easy.	Hoc non erat facile.
made me think.	me fecit cogitare.
They are evil.	Mali sunt.
But you have something to give here.	Sed habes aliquid hic dare.
Well he was already thirty.	Bene erat iam triginta.
I don't know what it is.	Nescio quid est.
Do not speak thus.	Noli sic loqui.
It is enough.	Satis est.
Now was not the time.	Nunc nec tempus erat.
You're not ready.	Non es paratus.
I don't know how to do it now.	Nescio quomodo id modo.
I've done that before.	Feci ut ante.
This he does thus.	Hoc sic facit.
Just one day she's gone.	Sicut unus dies abiit illa.
And no one can believe it to be true.	Et verum esse nemo potest credere.
That's not the first time I can stop you.	Primum id tempus non est, te prohibere potest.
We need to stay here.	Hic manere opus est.
It was necessary.	Necesse erat.
He was very sorry.	Erat valde.
I can't believe you anything.	Non possum tibi credere aliquid.
This is no longer there.	Hoc iam non est.
But no one wants it.	Sed id nulla velit.
I have done it by myself.	id a me feci.
You should listen.	Audire debes.
But it is great.	Magna sed.
That was a great one.	Ut quis magna erat.
We are not done.	Non sumus factum.
But it is not the same.	Sed non est ipsum.
No in now but.	Nulla in nunc nisi.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
I was late.	Sero eram.
But both are made.	Verum utrumque factum est.
we need it better.	melius nobis opus est.
Well there you said it to me.	Bene ibi dixisti mihi.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum ipsum.
This he did nothing.	Hoc nihil fecit.
He also doesn't want him.	Etiam non ipsum velit.
Now there is none.	Nunc non est nulla.
.	.
It looks like that.	Similis quod.
I will not do you evil.	non faciam tibi malum.
He was also in him.	Etiam in ipsum erat.
All in all.	Omnino dictum est.
I hope it does.	Spero eam facit.
That was one thing.	Quod erat unum.
I would do better by him.	melius ab eo facerem.
There is not one.	Unus non est.
It's not necessary at all.	Non ut necesse est omnino.
I need it.	Mihi opus est.
I'll tell you in the morning.	Dicam tibi mane.
I still have it today.	Adhuc hodie habeo.
I've only ever wanted to act.	Ego tantum semper agere volui.
It was a great affair.	Multum res erat.
You, with me.	Tu, mecum.
Which is necessary.	Quod necesse est.
Not alone, alone.	Non solus, solus.
day by day.	Dies per.
as you said.	sicut dixisti.
Maybe it was too much.	Aliquam erat nimis.
I like the same thing.	Idem mihi placet.
This was just after lunch.	Hoc mox post prandium fuit.
But for now, I don't like anything.	Sed nunc, non aliquid simile.
Never had, and perhaps never.	Numquam habuit, et fortasse numquam.
Maybe not yourself.	Aliquam non ipsum.
We're gonna be great for you.	Amet magna nobis te.
That's not much.	Non multum illud est.
No problem is out.	Nulla quaestio est ex.
This season has been successful.	Hoc tempore felix fuit.
You can't speak.	Non potes dicere.
But yesterday was a good day for me.	Sed heri erat mihi dies bonus.
Please, please.	Quaeso, quaeso.
Which indeed has been done.	Quod quidem factum est.
it seems to me like yesterday.	sicut heri mihi videtur.
It's fine too.	Bene quoque est.
I doubt very much.	Valde dubito.
You need to know.	Scire debes.
In this	In hoc, ad.
Probably his teacher.	Probabiliter magister eius.
but it is certain.	sed certus est.
Never say anything again!.	Numquam aliquid iterum!.
If it were so, he would still be there.	Si ita esset, adhuc ibi esset.
But it is not said, nor is there a lot to be said.	Sed dictum nec nulla sit amet dictum.
It may already be too late.	Ut iam sero sit.
You do, that's all.	Facis, id totum.
But he was here.	Sed hic erat.
It's not so much.	Non est tantum.
But he was not yet ready.	Sed nondum paratus erat.
Incorrectly or incorrectly.	Male vel recte.
Nothing I want you to do.	Nihil volo tibi hoc facere.
He is not alone.	Solus non est.
It's time to get away from the game.	Aliquam a velit est.
I don't like it at all.	Non placet omnibus.
But not how it is.	Sed non quam est.
And there are plenty of us enough.	Et multa nobis satis sunt.
Nothing can do better.	Nihil melius facere potest.
That's not what happened to you.	Quod factum non est de te.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
Both are the same.	Idem utrumque.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
Why this post is so late.	Quare haec post tam sero.
He knows everything.	Scit autem omnia.
I don't love you too.	Non amo etiam.
We are all men.	Omnes nos homines sumus.
But we are still here.	Sed adhuc hic sumus.
I was not there after all.	Ibi non eram, post omnes.
That's it before.	Ut id ante ante.
I had to listen.	Audire habui.
Maybe, but probably not.	Fortasse, sed verisimile non est.
You can't do this.	Hoc facere non potes.
I don't want to see this ever.	Nolo hoc semper videre.
No one told us not to talk to you.	Nemo nobis dixit te non loqui.
I don't need to talk to someone who did.	Non opus est loqui ad aliquem qui fecit.
And this is not even true.	Et hoc ne verum quidem est.
Everyone is there to see things.	Res ibi omnes videre.
I myself both.	Ipse ego ambo.
How long will it take?	Quam diu eam accipere?.
Not much with us.	Non multum apud nos.
It was not enough to see.	Parum erat videre.
I just didn't think it would happen.	Modo non fore videbatur.
Come to me with a question.	Venit ad me quaestio.
As it is with us.	Sicut est apud nos.
I just told you one thing.	Modo dixi vobis unum.
It is not.	Non est.
You can do this very well.	Hoc optime facere potes.
This ought to be the same.	Idem hic esse debet.
You know, but it's my job.	Scis, sed meum est officium.
I never wanted to tell you this.	Numquam hoc tibi dicere volui.
No one said the same.	Nulla quis dictum ipsum.
He just couldn't do it.	Iustus facere non potuit.
but it will be late.	sed sero erit.
They don't do anything.	Non sunt aliquid.
but to do nothing else.	sed nihil aliud agere.
He just doesn't do so well.	Iustus non ita bene rem facit.
Most likely all soon.	Verisimile omnibus mox.
This seems to be the case.	Quod de eo esse videtur.
You can't do this by yourself.	Hoc per te facere non potes.
Perhaps there was nothing in it.	Fortasse nihil erat in eo.
Absolutely something.	Omnino res.
They are never quick enough.	Numquam satis cito sunt.
Good to see her again.	Bonum est videre eam iterum.
So he speaks to me.	Ita me loquitur.
Nothing for me.	Nihil mihi.
But there was no time.	Sed non tempus erat.
It is not difficult.	Non est difficile.
It wasn't enough yet.	Non satis adhuc erat.
It's not what he wants for us.	Non sit quid nobis velit.
It's not what he wants to hear.	Non est id quod vult audire.
Take a look at this and why.	Vide hoc quare.
Really like it.	Vere placet.
If you can speak.	Si potes dicere.
and it was one thing for me.	unum et factum est mihi.
Maybe before that time.	Aliquam id tempus ante.
It was almost great.	Erat fere magna.
If not.	Nisi non.
For you.	Tu enim.
He never said anything.	Numquam aliquid dixit.
It's not so hard.	Non ita difficile est.
what else could have been wrong?.	Quid enim aliud mali potuit ?.
It would not be.	Non esset.
She's always had a trip.	Illa semper habuit iter.
We can't accept that.	Quod accipere non possumus.
I know he wants to be the only one.	Scio velle unum tantum esse.
I will do this again.	Hoc iterum faciam.
He's really doing nothing right now.	Ille vere nunc nihil facere.
By day, however, he still saw him.	Per diem tamen eum adhuc vidit.
We both need it.	Nobis utrumque opus est.
He does not say.	Non dicit.
The father had an affair.	Pater rem habuit.
There's a lot of time for it.	Multum ibi pro tempore.
I barely forgot it.	Oblitus vix id.
All or nothing alone ought to be there.	Solus ibi esse debet omnia vel nihil.
Not much.	Non multum.
And yet he was not.	Et adhuc non erat.
But it is not the same.	Sed non est ipsum.
I have enough.	satis habeo.
But there was something about this time.	Sed de hoc tempore aliquid erat.
It's something you don't talk about.	Est aliquid non loqui.
To never.	Ut numquam.
It is a good name.	Bonum nomen est.
To anyone.	Ut quis.
Something has to be.	Aliquid habet esse.
Thus he wished.	Sic voluit.
I guess maybe you're going to do it.	Suspicor te fortasse facturum esse.
He has also .	Habet etiam .
I want to know.	Scire volo.
Not one man.	Non unus homo.
It was his problem himself.	Eius quaestio ipsum erat.
But that is none.	Sed id nulla est.
They are bad enough.	Satis mali sunt.
It is the same.	Simile est .
This is my plan.	Hoc consilium meum est.
He did enough.	Satis fecit.
Okay, so it is.	Bene, ita est.
It was true yesterday.	Verum heri fuit.
Too many things.	Nimis multa.
And there is nothing wrong.	Et mali nihil est.
This would be necessary.	Hoc opus esset.
If you want to speak, you can.	Si vis loqui, potes.
She already knows.	Jam illa novit.
I have done nothing wrong.	Nihil mali feci.
There he came to him.	Ibi ad se venit.
It is not so here.	Non ita est hic.
It is not certain.	Non certum est.
It was always his.	Semper eius fuit.
What happened here.	Quod hic factum est.
He doesn't know where he is.	Nescit ubi sit.
I know exactly what it is.	Novi prorsus quid sit.
Longer this time.	Diutius hoc tempore.
we need more.	plus nobis opus est.
in front or not well.	In vel ante non bene.
I guess they are.	Suspicor, sunt.
Do it, I beg you.	Fac, quaeso.
And this is all.	Et hoc totum est.
I only need time now.	Tantum nunc temporis opus est.
He is with me in all things.	Ipse mecum per omnia.
I could not get enough of it.	Satis ex eo non potui.
He doesn't want to talk.	Loqui non vult.
he said to himself.	dixit se.
This season has been successful.	Hoc tempus felix fuit.
I need you to do it.	Mihi opus est tibi facere.
As far as we can tell.	Quantum autem non possumus dicere.
There was no need to say.	Dicere opus erat.
Well, not today, but soon.	Bene, non hodie, sed mox.
But he wants it.	Sed est velit.
You have to play better.	Melius habes ludere.
Who's great? 	Magna quis?
Nothing can prevent it.	Nihil prohibere potest.
I was everything.	omnia fui.
Look really good.	Bonum vide rem.
It is not good.	Non bona.
He has left me.	Ipse me reliquit.
you can still do it too.	potes tamen etiam.
This is what he did.	Hoc ipsum quod fecit.
Maybe it could be too much.	Posset fortasse nimis.
This is a difficult time for us.	Difficile est hoc tempus nobis.
You can truly	Vere potes.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
He seems to know too much.	Nimium scire videtur.
It was his job.	Eius officium erat.
He is behind her.	Ipse post eam.
It was not done yet.	Non tamen factum est.
Never doubt.	Nunquam dubito.
The father was there.	Pater ibi fuit.
Time is time.	Tempus est tempus.
It was probably this time.	Verisimile erat hoc tempore.
All the best.	Omnes optime.
I never forgot about you.	Numquam de te oblitus sum.
He could do well.	Bene potuit.
I've never done this or something like that.	Nunquam feci hoc vel simile.
Which indeed would not be easy.	Quod quidem facile non esset.
Everything is great.	Omnia magna.
You are the same.	Tu ipse es.
See? 	Vide?
But it is not so.	Sed non ita est.
That's all left now.	Id est omnia nunc reliquit.
There is no such thing.	Nulla id ipsum est.
That was good and bad.	Quod erat bonum et malum.
I have never seen anything.	nihil umquam vidi.
No one knows what it is.	Nemo scit quid sit.
But not enough yet.	Sed non satis tamen.
So he did the work.	Sic fecit opus.
all together now.	Omnes simul nunc.
He didn't tell me who it was.	Non dixit mihi quis esset.
He knows exactly.	Prorsus novit.
I can't make a decision for you.	Non possum tibi consilium facere.
This is almost all work.	Hoc fere totum opus est.
But not enough for this.	Sed parum ad hoc.
But here it is said.	Sed hic dictum est.
But it's okay.	Sed bene.
I had not.	Non habui.
You can stay at home.	Domi manere potes.
This he did well.	Hoc bene fecit.
That was so.	Sic erat id.
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
You don't get what he says.	Et non id quod loquitur.
This was not enough.	Nec hoc satis.
In this way he could not do it.	Hoc modo facere non potuit.
But he or she wants it.	Sed vel ipsum velit.
You have it for sure.	Pro certo habes.
Well, that's what he does.	Bene, id quod facit.
We are not here.	Non hic sumus.
it will be good.	bonus erit.
He did not know who the man was.	Nesciebat quis homo esset.
What was there?	Quid ibi fuit.
You'd like to be true.	Velis verum.
If not, no.	Si non, non.
This has already been done.	Hoc iam factum est.
She really had me.	Illa vere habuit in me.
He was and is.	Et erat, et est.
For this was it.	Hic erat id enim.
I think that's what I believe today.	Puto id esse quod hodie credo.
Not so bad, she thought.	Non tam malum, putavit.
We need to talk a little more.	Paulo plus loqui necesse est.
I also want you to know that this is correct.	Volo etiam te scire id recte esse.
I didn't say anything like that.	Non dixi aliquid simile.
I hope you do something like that.	Spero te aliquid simile de eo.
I wish he could.	Utinam ille.
I do, very much.	facio, valde.
I know, and you.	Scio, et tu.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
Yes and it is for you.	Etiam et est enim.
Well that's what it is.	Bene est id quod est.
It looks pretty.	Spectat satis.
I've never met before.	Nunquam ante me occurrit.
He will only do it.	Ipse modo faciam.
Which certainly is not true.	Quod certe non est verum.
Thus it was .	Sic erat .
You are only me.	Tu solus mihi.
I want you to go with it.	Volo te ire cum illo.
I hope today is well with you.	Spero hodie quoque bene tibi est.
He said that he was not true.	Dixit se non esse verum.
I will do this.	Ego hoc faciam.
Not even a little.	Ne parum quidem.
But he was not out.	Sed non erat ex.
I see all the time.	Omnia tempus video.
You do what you can best.	Optime facis quod potes.
There's nothing wrong with this.	Nihil hic mali.
which I never heard.	quod numquam audivi.
She never had.	Illa nunquam habuit.
They are right here right here.	Hic recte hic sunt.
Are you ready?	Paratus es?.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
You know very well.	Tu optime scis.
He could do more.	Plus potuit.
But he never does so.	Sed nunquam sic agit.
I'm not sure why.	Non sum certus quid.
A lot of money.	Multum pecuniae.
I like it enough.	Mihi satis placet.
I did not do this today.	Hoc hodie non feci.
Make him get one.	Fac eum ut unum.
Here we have what we need.	Hic habemus quod opus est.
No one really knew.	Nemo vere scivit.
Yes, we can.	Ita, possumus.
My name is no longer my name.	Nomen meum iam non est nomen meum.
yes it looks pretty good to her.	Etiam illud spectat satis ad eam.
In that regard.	In id ipsum quam.
He would not do this.	Noluit hoc.
I don't want that either.	Nolo id vel.
Nothing else had ever happened to her.	Nihil umquam aliud cum illa.
This is what he did.	Hoc est quod fecit illum.
Work for me.	Opus mihi.
And there was a name too.	Et fuit nomen quoque.
We can not.	Non possumus.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est verum.
He thought as much as he thought.	Putabat quantum putabat.
You can do absolutely nothing and do nothing good.	Omnino nihil potes facere et bonum facere.
Not always.	Non semper.
This is a lot of time.	Hoc est multum tempus.
Well this is how it started.	Bene est quomodo incepit.
It was enough, but still enough.	Satis tamen satis erat.
The genus is not to be but to be made.	Genus non est esse sed fieri.
I am going to do everything.	Omnia mihi facturus.
I know to be there.	Scio ibi esse.
But this is one thing.	Sed hoc aliud est.
I haven't been alone for a long time.	Solus non fui diu.
He did not understand.	Non intellexit.
But that's how nothing.	Sed id quam nisi.
Which makes me wonder too.	Quod me quoque miror.
Someone is still there.	Aliquis adhuc ibi est.
He was never, never alone.	Numquam erat, numquam solus.
I heard everything about him.	Audivi omnia de eo.
Do the same for yourself.	Idem fac tibi.
Without him there is nothing much.	Sine eo nihil multum.
He didn't want to be here.	Noluit hic esse.
He could still hear nothing.	Adhuc nihil potuit audire.
It will be with everyone.	Sic erit cum omnibus.
He is going up in the morning.	Eat usque mane.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
I never thought this was good.	Numquam hoc bonum esse putavi.
You are not for him.	Non es pro eo.
I just didn't want to talk.	Dicere modo nolebat.
This was at home.	Hic domi erat.
And who's it.	Et quis eam.
I have to be done again.	Habeo iterum fieri.
I hope you're able to do the same.	Spero te posse idem facere.
I looked to him.	Vidi ad ipsum.
He has gone to the office.	Abiit in officium.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum est.
This is all yours.	Hoc est totum tuum.
That would be good.	Quod esset bonum.
I do good work.	Bonum opus facio.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
Let me tell you something.	Dicam tibi aliquid.
I always want to do something else.	Semper aliud agere volo.
Well too bad.	Bene etiam malum.
I still have time to go.	Adhuc tempus habeo ire.
That's the same thing.	Ut id ipsum est.
He is the same man.	Idem homo est.
They are not his.	Non sunt eius.
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
By him he could not.	Per eum non potuit.
And no one knows this.	Et nemo scit hoc.
You want to know why.	Vis scire cur.
Certainly he did not understand well.	Non certe bene intellexit.
It seems to be okay.	Bene esse videtur.
he says he does it.	dixit hoc facit.
Take some time here.	Hic tempus aliquam.
I hope it's better now.	Spero melius nunc est.
That's not always going to happen.	Quod non semper futurum est.
He tried too hard to give her everything she wanted.	Conatus est difficile ei omnia dare quae vellet.
I've been pretty good since tonight.	Cum hac nocte satis fui.
It was an.	Erat an.
It was a great story.	Aliquam in magna erat.
You are not the same.	Non idem es.
At that time it was.	In id tempus erat.
I tried to talk to him.	Conatus sum dicere ei.
I feel so alone.	Ego sentio solus.
To be honest there is nothing.	Ut sit amet nulla nisi.
Everything there is great.	Omnia ibi multa.
Maybe not great.	Fortasse non magna.
It's hard to do.	Difficile est hoc facere.
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
Yes it is important to say that.	Etiam sit amet dictum quam.
He does not speak.	Non loquitur.
It was very late.	Sero admodum fuit.
Tell me to be here.	Dic me hic esse.
This class does it.	Hoc genus facit illud.
He could not say anything.	Non potuit dicere quicquam.
Even not before.	Etiam non ante.
Nothing else is needed.	Nihil aliud opus est.
I said I don't like it.	Dictum eius non amo.
I'd done that.	Id factum esse vellem.
He refused to see.	Noluit videre.
Now we can talk.	Nunc loqui possumus.
But that was in place.	Sed id erat in est.
I can't believe it.	Credere non possum.
No one ever said.	Nemo umquam.
Not much.	Non multum.
He did not tell what had happened.	Quid acciderit non indicavit.
Do not do this.	Noli hoc facere.
That's for sure it will do.	Id certe facturus est.
There's never a man there.	In quis numquam enim.
You need to do something more with.	Aliquid plus ex debes facere.
But he did this before.	Sed hoc ante fecerit.
It's good to hear you're still there.	Hoc bonum est audire te esse adhuc ibi.
I just don't want to go now.	Modo non vis ire nunc.
The next time	Proximo tempore.
Also get some out tomorrow.	Etiam cras aliquam ex.
There was more.	Plus erat.
We're all wrong.	Omnes mali sumus.
It's done a lot.	Factum est multum.
It's not my only problem.	Solus non est mihi quaestio.
If and when he does.	Si et quando facit.
I have seen too much.	Nimium vidi.
Boy, this is going to happen.	Puer, hoc futurum est.
I am not alone.	Solus non sum.
It was probably him.	Probabiliter fuit eum.
Or perhaps there was someone else.	Vel fortasse erat aliquis.
Police said.	Aliquam dictum.
I am doing my job.	Ego facio officium meum.
He wanted to see this alone.	Hoc solum videre voluit.
Don't act on it.	Non agere.
But that is how.	Sed id est quam.
Well, yes.	Bene, sed.
often not.	Saepe non.
But I have not said no.	Sed non dictum nulla.
That can be.	Illud potest esse.
He was in and of himself.	In et ipsum erat.
That's where it probably is.	Id ubi verisimile est.
I know what you'd like to talk about.	Scio quid velis loqui.
He knew people didn't understand.	Sciebat homines non intelligere.
You can go this way.	Sic ire potes.
It was like he couldn't stop.	Similis erat prohibere non potuit.
So I did not know.	Ita nesciebam.
Not even that.	Ne eam quidem.
My father is not so.	Pater meus non ita est.
You act alone.	Te solum agere.
Well done.	Bene factum est.
This could be bad.	Posset hoc esse malum.
All I need is you.	Omnes opus est tibi.
This question is really about when.	Hic quaestio vere est fere quando.
It is not good for me to do.	Non est bonum mihi facere.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
That is not yet.	Nondum id est.
But it is not so.	Sed non ita est.
I don't know how anyone loves.	Nescio quomodo quis amet.
I am not one of you.	Non sum unus ex vobis.
But that was not now.	Sed id nunc non erat.
Time is not alone.	Tempus non solum.
Got anything else for you.	Obtinuit aliud tibi.
This is difficult, but it is not possible.	Hoc difficile est, sed id non potest.
No one wants to leave everything they know.	Nemo relinquere omnia quae scire vult.
You don't like it.	Tibi non placet.
But quite rightly.	Sed satis recte.
Would definitely see him again.	Certum esset videre eum iterum.
It would seem that he never did.	Videtur quod nunquam fecit.
I have to see you.	Habeo te videre.
I don't want to do that.	Nolo facere.
It's still good, but .	Est adhuc bonum, sed .
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
But yet he said yes.	Sed tamen dixit quod sic.
But it could have been better.	Sed melius fieri potuit.
you never forgot me.	a me numquam oblitus es.
I want you to be with me.	Volo te esse mecum.
It was another name.	Aliud nomen erat.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
Never again.	Numquam iterum.
In order to be great.	In ut magna est.
But that's where it is.	Sed id ubi simile est.
Please stay with me.	Mane mecum quaeso.
He always wants it too.	Etiam id semper velit.
We both like to see it.	Ambo ad eam, sicut.
The boy did not know.	Nesciebat puer.
Now he realized how much more could be done.	Plus nunc intellexit quomodo fieri posset.
Yes, but before him.	Etiam sed ipsum ante.
I know you're able to do this.	Scio te hoc facere posse.
That's what time it was.	Ut id tempus quam.
What day would you like.	Diem quam libet.
If there is any need, tell me.	Si quid opus est, dic.
You said nothing wrong.	Nihil mali dixisti.
Certainly I can.	Certe possum.
But we are still here.	Sed adhuc hic sumus.
I want us to be together.	Volo nos esse simul.
This was just now.	Hic modo erat, nunc.
He could not do it.	Potuit facere.
He never understood.	Nunquam intellexit.
Even from time to time.	De tempore etiam.
That's okay.	Quod bene.
Definitely one.	Certus unus.
We have it too.	Illud quoque habemus.
To never, ever get there.	Ut nunquam, semper illuc.
I hope you like it!	Spero te similis ei!.
If you want to have.	Si vis habere.
therefore he was here.	quare hic fuit.
Which indeed is not.	Quod quidem non est.
Yes, that's how it always is.	Etiam id semper quam.
But he knew this to be true.	Sed sciebat hoc verum esse.
But nothing comes.	Sed nihil venit.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
I think it is probable.	Probabile esse puto.
You've done it.	Tu factum est.
Not enough for three.	Non satis tres.
He does not do this anymore.	Hoc amplius non facit.
I'm going to want to get there.	Eo vis illuc.
Nothing speaks to me.	Nisi mihi loquitur.
He would do it himself.	Facturum se eam.
You can go to him.	Ad eum potes ire.
I will tell you this.	Dicam tibi hoc.
But that's not always.	Sed id non semper.
Probably a man.	Verisimiliter homo.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
He refused to help me.	Noluit auxilium.
Doing this seems to help a little.	Hoc faciens, parum videtur adiuvare.
you can know.	scire potes.
Today, she thought.	Hodie, putavit.
That's going to happen.	Quod futurum est.
It is not bad.	Non malum.
Please do a good job.	Fac bonum officium placet.
Her father had not.	Pater suus non habuit.
it looks good.	bonum videtur.
But I don't see much.	Verum, non multum video.
This was only this morning.	Hic modo hic erat mane.
I never need it.	Numquam mihi opus est.
to think so.	ut puto.
He was not quite sure.	Non erat satis certus.
Not this morning.	Non hoc mane.
It's something like that.	Est aliquid simile.
So perhaps they are not that good.	Ita fortasse non sunt id bonum.
We can't do it alone.	Solus id facere non possumus.
Maybe it wasn't but it was.	Aliquam non nisi erat.
He was gonna do something about it.	Ille erat amet aliquid de eo.
Please go.	Ire velit.
You know if I need it.	Scis, si opus est.
He does very well.	Optime facit.
i thought you were.	Putabam te esse.
did it, you know.	fecerit, scis.
Not sure what you like yet.	Non certus quod similis adhuc.
I need you.	Opus est tibi .
feel it again.	iterum sentio.
No one knows everything.	Nemo omnia novit.
But not as much as him.	Sed non quam ipsum.
I can't, I can't.	Non possum, non possum.
Everyone here knows.	Omnes hic scit.
I am the one who made it.	Ego sum ille qui fecit.
I am as happy as you can be.	Tam felix sum quantum potes esse.
Talk to me.	Loqui mecum.
There is no way to love yourself now.	Nulla ut ipsum nunc.
That which was not done.	Quod factum non est.
I know what is true.	Scio quid verum sit.
I can't have him at home with me again.	Non possum iterum illum domi habere mecum.
i was in school.	in schola fui.
Evil is evil to him.	Malum est ei malum.
It probably wasn't that good.	Probabile erat id bonum.
This is my advice.	Meum est consilium.
Yes, that's what he wants.	Etiam id velit est.
They are good for us.	Bona sunt nobis.
That's what I always do.	Quae semper id.
This work has not yet been done.	Id opus nondum factum est.
Maybe she thought like that too.	Forsitan id quoque ei simile putavit.
I'll just say it.	Modo id dicam.
You look great.	Te magna vide.
There is always tomorrow.	Cras semper nulla est.
Last year he certainly did.	Proximo anno certe fecit.
So much for us.	Multum nobis ita sunt.
Well soon!	Bene cito!.
But he said nothing about him.	Sed nihil de eo dixit.
And certainly it was.	Et certe fuit.
i have done it repeatedly.	saepe feci.
It is true today.	Verum est hodie.
This is very good.	Is est valde bonus.
But it is not true.	Sed non est verum.
But not in all.	Sed non in omnibus.
That time is not.	Quod tempus non est.
Thus it is possible.	Ita potest.
Someone has to know.	Aliquis habet scire.
We can only do one thing right now.	Non solum unum nunc facere possumus.
Not nothing, yes.	Non nihil, etiam.
it was not necessary.	necesse non fuit.
I need to understand.	Mihi opus est intelligere .
It looked different.	Aliud videbatur.
This is something new.	Hoc est aliquid novi.
For some or for him.	Aliquam vel ipsum enim.
If this is so.	Hoc si ita est.
Now here's the thing.	Nunc hic rem.
To be honest with someone.	Ut sit amet aliquam ex.
You can't do everything by yourself.	Omnia facere non potes per te ipsum.
No one at all.	Nemo omnino .
And as he said, so will it be.	Et sicut dixit, sic erit.
My father was like my father.	Pater meus sicut pater meus fuit.
He knew he could do it.	Posset facere, scivit.
He was and was.	Erat, et erat.
This does not appear to be possible.	Hoc non videtur posse.
To him it was not enough.	Ei parum ei.
But time has been said only.	Sed tempus dictum nisi.
Maybe you're ready to buy this.	Forsitan paratus es hoc emere.
I don't need to do that.	Non opus est me facere.
Please think about it now.	Placet cogitare de illo modo.
It's not the same as that.	Etiam non ipsum quam.
You don't have .	Non habes .
You talk to me.	Tu mihi loqui.
You need to do another work.	Aliud opus facere debes.
To go to school.	Ire scholam.
Or not.	Vel non.
I don't need you.	Et non opus est tibi.
But he was unwilling to do it.	Sed id facere nolebat.
This is almost all we can say.	Hoc est, fere omnes possumus dicere.
I'd say it's too good.	Nimis bonum est dicere vellem.
What he did.	Quod fecit.
Or you're out yourself.	Vel te ipsum e.
I know many things about her, but certainly not all.	Multa de illa scio, sed certe non omnia.
This will not be enough.	Hoc satis non erit.
Well, we have a good job.	Bene, bonum opus habemus.
It is important to be yourself beforehand.	Aliquam sit amet ipsum ante.
I wanted to know.	scire volui.
And at last he wished to have her.	Et tandem eam habere voluit.
Thus it was done.	Sic factum est.
But not much, see.	Sed non multum, vide.
I had a great time working out.	Vidi opus, magna tempus.
The design seems pretty good.	Consilium satis bonum videtur.
This is not yours.	Hoc non est tuum.
Breakfast is hard.	Prandium difficile est.
It is not.	Non est.
But that was none.	Sed id erat nulla.
But it will not be necessary.	Sed non erit necesse.
There was nothing she could do now.	Nihil erat quod nunc facere posset.
Even I don't know his name.	Etiam nomen eius non novi.
I don't like that time.	Non ut illo tempore.
Without me in this moment.	Hoc tempore sine me in.
But that's how it is.	Sed id quam ipsum.
One man told everything.	Unus homo omnia indicavit.
She was still happy.	Fuit tamen felix.
if you are thinking.	si cogitas.
I know I am.	Scio ego.
I don't believe this one.	Hoc unum non credo.
This is not going to be enough.	Hoc non satis futurum est.
That was it.	Fuit id.
I love my advice.	Amo consilium meum.
But not for him.	Sed non ipsum enim.
There's only one.	Nulla solum.
It was not in him.	In non erat ipsum.
i didn't think.	non putavi.
in which way it is said.	quo modo dictum est.
I thought this for sure.	Hoc pro certo cogitavi.
It is looking good this morning.	Non est vultus bonus hoc mane.
I don't want to go this way.	Hoc volo ire non modo.
He has done many things for me.	Multa mihi fecit.
I guess? 	Suspicor?
And you can do nothing.	Et nihil potes.
Make it better for you that day.	Fac ut melius tibi illa die.
That's only who he was.	Ut quis nisi erat.
All men are evil.	Male omnes homines.
I just want to help her.	Ego iustus volo eam adiuvare.
This is going to work.	Hoc opus facturus est.
And he got that.	Quod et obtinuit.
You're not here to think.	Non es hic cogitare.
This does not seem likely.	Hoc non videtur probabile.
Who made what was done.	Qui fecit quod factum est.
I didn't want to be with people.	Nolui esse apud homines.
He could not stay here.	Hic manere potuit.
I want to know if its possible.	Scire volo si suum fieri potest.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
I have more.	plus habeo.
I just can't help myself.	Modo non possum me.
He tries everything.	Conatur omnia.
This is easy.	Hoc facile est.
He could not believe.	Credere non potuit.
I want it to be.	id esse volo.
Yes, how quickly it's done.	Ita, quam cito factum est.
Nothing to do with money.	Nihil ad pecuniam.
And yet it was done.	Et tamen factum est.
I really, really love you.	Ego vere, vere amo.
I feel nothing so tense.	Nihil tam temporis sentio.
But this does not appear.	Sed hoc non videtur.
It could take a long time.	Diu posset accipere.
I've been thinking about something else.	Ego iam aliquid aliud cogitas.
This video is still out.	Hoc adhuc ex video.
Well, here it is now.	Bene, hic nunc est.
He wanted to do it.	Facere cum vellet.
There is nothing wrong with him.	Nihil mali ei.
Whether for you or for .	An tibi vel pro .
But nothing, no one.	Sed nihil, nemo.
He knows her well.	Novit eam bene.
And somebody else do.	Et quis quid aliud.
I could hear, I could not see a thing.	Audire potui, rem videre non potui.
But make sure you're on time.	Sed fac sis in tempore.
Everyone knows everything about who one is.	Scit omnia de omnibus qui quis est.
I have done mine.	Meum feci.
You know, and it was.	Scis, et fuit.
You know where you are.	Scis ubi sis.
What he wants to have at home.	Quid sibi velit domi habere.
Good to hear.	Bonum est audire.
That is right.	Id est, recte.
It is not well done.	Non bene factum est.
He always goes, he goes, he goes.	Semper eat eat eat.
I see why.	Hoc video cur.
I could speak of him.	de eo loqui potui.
I don't even do anything.	Non etiam quicquam.
That to come.	Quod venire.
it is not forgotten.	non est oblitus.
It has been long enough.	Satis diu fuit.
Where are you now?	Ubi es nunc?.
There is truth.	Ibi verum esse.
Better than ever.	Melius quam semper.
It was time to go.	Tempus erat ut.
But neither is there any none at all.	Sed nec aliquam nulla.
He doesn't know how much.	Nescit quantum.
after how long.	Post quam diu.
Lunch is a must.	Prandium est necesse est.
But this is the matter.	Sed haec res est.
But that's only what.	Sed id nisi quam.
I am with him.	cum eo sum.
Evil, evil, evil.	Malum, malum, malum.
i think i owe you more.	plus debere puto.
Which is very true.	Quod multum verum est.
Which he probably had.	Quam probabiliter habuit.
If you don't want to, do it for you.	Si non vis, id ad te.
but they are.	sed sunt.
This is so easy.	Hoc tam facile.
I hope that's okay.	Spero quod bene.
It is likely to be with her.	Verisimile est cum illa.
It would probably do well.	Probabile esset bene facere.
how i want something.	quam volo aliquid.
He did not do what he did.	Non fecit quod fecit.
It's hard to say.	Suus 'difficile est dicere.
No one knows what you are thinking.	Nemo scit quid cogitas.
No, no, it's not me.	Non, non, non est mihi.
I can do all things.	Omnia possum.
I never love him.	Numquam amet ipsum ut.
And this also.	Et hoc etiam.
That will be for another time.	Id erit in aliud tempus.
But not quite yet.	Sed non admodum sed.
He could not do the work alone.	Opus solum facere non potuit.
I like it too much.	Mihi nimium placet.
But that's something that's a job.	Sed id est aliquid quod est officium.
He doesn't know what he wants.	Nescit quidem quid velit.
I have more.	plus habeo.
But this was not necessary.	Sed hoc opus non erat.
What's better for me than that.	Quid me melius quam.
I am not doing too badly.	Non nimis male facio.
And so he does.	Et sic facit .
He never wanted to speak of him.	de eo loqui numquam voluit.
I don't want to do it right now.	Nolo nunc facere.
Good to know.	Bonum scire.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
But yet it is none.	Sed sed est nulla.
Which is so.	Quod ita est.
I hope that's good for you.	Spero autem quod bona est tibi.
No, this is not possible.	Non, id fieri non potest.
I don't owe you anything.	Non tibi quicquam debet.
You're never doing this.	Numquam hoc es.
There's always more than that.	Nulla a semper quam.
It was work in the morning.	Mane opus erat.
You really should give it.	Illud vere dare debet.
Something to do something.	Aliquid facere aliquid.
I knew all along.	Sciebam per omnia.
If you don't.	Quod si non feceris.
He knew exactly where he was.	Scivit prorsus ubi esset.
And never.	Et numquam.
To see if anything.	Ut si quid.
Which is not entirely true.	Quod non est omnino verum.
This work is my work.	Hoc opus est mihi opus.
I saw how it could be done.	Vidi quomodo posset.
But it was not that.	Sed non erat id.
Well so far.	Bene tantum est.
It has some.	Ita habet aliquam.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
They are men.	Homines sunt.
Please just talk to someone, someone.	Placet modo loqui ad aliquem, aliquem.
You will do.	Facturus es.
There is better.	Ibi melius est.
that is your future plan.	id est futurum consilium.
This was long ago.	Hic multo ante fuit.
He was not, not me.	Non erat, non mihi.
Get what you have.	Accipere quod habes.
This also works well.	Hoc quoque bene.
He wanted nothing for himself.	Nihil sibi voluit.
It looks like.	Simile videtur.
Not well, but better.	Non bene, sed melius.
You are thinking.	Tu cogitas.
He is no longer a father.	Pater iam non est.
He knew he needed to do something.	Aliquid scivit opus facere.
I really don't know.	Ego vere nescio.
It's going to be hard to find.	Hoc futurum est difficile invenire.
This is so difficult.	Hoc tam difficile est.
I would like to talk about it.	Dicere vellem de illo.
But he does it in some way.	Sed facit aliquo modo.
Sorting here.	Genus hic.
Talk all about everything.	Omnia de omnibus loqui.
Maybe that's great.	Aliquam id magna est.
This is not necessarily a bad thing.	Hoc ne malum sit necesse est.
He speaks of himself.	De se loquitur.
This was so done.	Hoc ita factum est.
I will not tell if anything has happened.	Non dicam si quid acciderit.
There was a busy man.	Fuit homo occupatus.
You are yourself.	Tu ipsum esse.
Even dinner started.	Etiam cenam incepit.
Maybe it was better not to listen.	Fortasse melius erat non audire.
I think we all have.	Puto nos omnes habere.
i can see it happening.	fieri videre possum.
And there is nothing else to do.	Et nihil est aliud facere.
That was great.	Erat id magna.
It was good.	Bonum erat.
This was yesterday morning.	Hoc erat heri mane.
But that's only him.	Sed id nisi ipsum.
And so to know.	Ita quoque scire.
If you're me.	Si tu mihi.
They are men	Homines sunt .
Without you, it is not for us.	Sine te, non est nobis.
He thought he was too much.	Putabat se nimium esse.
Thus he was among us.	Sic inter nos erat.
He did not say to me.	Non dixit mihi.
I could not think why.	Non potui quare cogitare.
I'll tell you when.	Dicam cum.
How bad can it be? 	Quomodo malum fieri potest?
But not always save.	Sed non semper nisi.
We can do anything to help.	Quid adiuvare possumus.
It will be .	Erit .
He knew for sure.	Sciebat certe.
She could still speak.	Posset adhuc loqui.
We can do it together.	Simul id facere possumus.
This is true.	Hoc verum est.
And again.	Et iterum.
But he could not think of it.	Sed non potuit cogitare de illo.
You have me.	Habes me.
Everything he wanted.	Omnia voluit.
Or it may be.	Vel ut sit.
i thought we were going to have it together last night.	Putabam nos habere heri simul.
Looking, that was it.	Vultus, id erat.
I don't have time to say anything.	Dicere aliquid tempus non.
Don't go to school.	Noli ad scholam ire.
What he had, she thought.	Quod habuit, putavit.
You can't speak.	Non potes dicere.
I'm not exactly sure.	Non sum prorsus certus.
I really like my job.	Ego vere amo meum officium.
Look after him.	Vide post se.
No, that's not enough to do.	Non, parum est quod facere.
When it is good, it is really good.	Cum bonum est, vere bonum est.
I must listen to the truth.	verum audire debeo.
Not an easy decision, but you need to make one last.	Non facile consilium, sed unum debes tandem facere.
Not even that day.	Non illo quidem die.
When we have time.	Cum tempus habemus.
Well, that's not a problem right now.	Bene, id iam quaestio non est.
If he did.	Si fecerit.
That's how I get out of it.	Ut id quam ex.
And you do not do this.	Et hoc non facis.
If anything, it is better.	Si quid, melius est.
Do good work.	Bonum opus fac.
Please, this way.	Quaeso, hoc modo.
But that's how it was.	Sed id quam erat.
I don't see exactly how you do it.	Non video prorsus quomodo id facias.
I see a lot of things.	multum video.
I can say nothing now.	Nihil nunc possum dicere.
What he did not want.	Quod ille nolebat.
I don't want to be good.	Non volo bonum esse.
Can't be good.	Non potest esse bonum.
This would be between us.	Esset hoc inter nos.
May help.	Sit auxilio.
Much, yes.	Multum, sic.
It makes me absolutely sick.	Male me omnino facit.
Maybe you don't have time to do it.	Fortasse non tempus facere.
I just want to find mine.	EGO iustus volo invenire meum.
No as said no.	Nulla ut dictum nulla.
You don't need to talk.	Loqui non necesse est.
I could not do more.	non potui amplius.
He did really poorly by you.	Male a vobis vere ille fecit.
He will not .	Non vult .
I never was happy again.	Numquam adhuc felix fuit.
Yes, that is.	Etiam, est id.
And really sorry for you.	Et vere paenitet tibi.
when in here and now.	Cum in hic et nunc.
Which is not so.	Quod non ita est.
So without help.	Sic sine auxilio.
Which is great.	Quae magna.
That's the thing to do now.	Sic iam rem agere.
Tonight or no.	Hac nocte vel nulla.
But that's only what he wants.	Sed id nisi velit.
but I don't know how you do it.	sed nescio quo modo facis.
We cannot do this.	Hoc facere non possumus.
It's okay already.	Jam bene est.
But not in this way.	Sed non hoc modo.
He can only see something.	Aliquid solum videre potest.
I don't want to think anything else.	Nolo aliquid aliud cogitare.
To be what he wants.	Esse quae velit.
In what he did not know.	In quid nesciebat.
And I like it more.	Et plus placet.
That's the whole thing.	Id quod totum est.
never get there.	numquam illuc.
Much too good seemed to be true.	Multum etiam bonum videbatur esse verum.
It cannot be.	Esse non potest.
as it always used to be.	sicut semper fieri solebat.
I don't understand that question.	Quaestio non intelligere illa.
But not to act.	Sed non agere.
But it is also how.	Sed et est quam.
No one knew nothing.	Nemo nihil scivit.
You can see it here.	Hic videre potes.
No but a great ex.	Nulla sed magna ex.
I didn't think it would happen.	Non putavi fore.
There is no more.	Non est amplius.
As he could see in and through it.	Sicut videre potuit in et per eam.
It never occurred to me.	Is nunquam mihi occurrit.
But there was no time.	Sed nec tempus erat.
I have everything.	Habeo omnia.
Certainly not tonight.	Certe hac nocte non est.
I appreciate your help.	Ut bene tuum auxilium.
It is one thing after another.	Aliud est aliud post aliud.
For us all.	Pro nobis omnibus.
It will be fine for you.	Bene tibi erit.
You don't want us to know about it.	Non vis nobis scire de eo.
Probably more than me.	Verisimiliter quam me.
The next night the same.	Proxima nocte idem.
You'd be good.	Bonum esse velis.
You already have a job.	Iam habes officium.
It is a bad name.	Malum est nomen.
Do what you want, if you like.	Quod facere facias, si libet.
Time is for us.	Tempus pro nobis est.
I've done a lot of traveling.	Multum iter feci.
I couldn't even think.	Ne cogitare quidem potui.
I know what is true.	Scio quid verum sit.
It is here to speak the truth.	Est hic verum loqui.
But not great.	Sed non magna.
I am a man like you.	Homo sum sicut tu.
Maybe that's for no reason.	Aliquam id enim nulla.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Non potuit amplius accipere.
I need you for it.	Opus est tibi ad eam.
I could not think like this.	Non potui sic cogitare.
He understood.	Intellexit.
Finally got it started.	Tandem obtinuit eam incepit.
They are all so little.	Tam parum sunt omnes.
This is what he wanted to do.	Hoc est quod facere voluit.
Yes it is a journey.	Ita est iter.
Please do.	Placet facere.
By this means.	Hoc per.
That was this morning.	Quod erat hoc mane.
There it is, and yet it is not.	Ibi est, et tamen non est.
But it has been said.	Sed dictum est enim.
I have seen yours.	Vidi tuum.
Certainly it can also be seen that this was done.	Certe id quoque factum videri potest.
for he knew that he would go to her.	Sciebat enim per- ire ​​ad eam.
Is it so?	An ita est?.
But that was great.	Sed id erat magna.
i feel happy.	felix sentio.
I don't know where.	Nescio ubi.
I can always see people.	Semper videre possum homines.
Maybe that's not what you think.	Forsitan non est quod tibi videtur.
It's not too late for me, that is.	Non mihi sero , id est .
Look where they are now.	Vide ubi nunc sunt.
He could not live again.	Iterum vivere potuit.
He's almost gone now.	Ipse fere iam abiit.
He was my father	Pater meus erat .
Just like yesterday.	Sicut heri.
Who's done it.	Qui factum.
He wanted to know who his father was.	Scire voluit quis pater esset.
You already have everything.	Omnia iam habes.
Which is not seen.	Quod non videtur.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
But the time was different.	Sed tempus aliud fuit.
He would not hear any more.	Noluit amplius audire.
As you can see there is no need.	Ut videre potes non est opus.
It's time to love yourself.	Aliquam sit amet ipsum.
he wanted him to live.	eum vivere voluit.
I like everything.	Mihi placet omnia.
He wanted to do things.	Res agere voluit.
The work is better.	Opus melius.
But that is the same.	Sed ut ipsum est.
I'm going that way now.	Eo nunc illuc.
The teacher is coming.	Magister venit.
Which is bad.	Quod est malum.
You just play with each other.	Vos iustus ludere inter se.
He knew he had something to do with him.	Sciebat se aliquid apud se habere.
It can be very tense.	Valde temporis potest esse.
This was bad.	Hoc erat malum.
No he doesn't want to.	Nulla non velit.
But I don't know whether he likes it.	Sed nescio an velit.
You can't do it right.	Recte facere non potes.
You are the one who did this.	Tu es qui hoc fecisti.
Just don't know why.	Iustus nescio cur.
You are just.	Iustus es.
He willed, he willed.	Voluit, voluit.
That's how it always is.	Ut id semper quam.
Who wants to be with you?	Qui tecum esse vult.
Please try again before ex.	Aliquam vel ante ex.
Probably wrong, he thought.	Verisimiliter male, putabat.
Never regret to speak the truth.	Numquam paenitet verum loqui.
To always do it yourself.	Ut semper id ipsum.
And it is possible.	Et potest.
But there was some.	Sed aliquam erat.
I said well.	Dixi bene.
None of this has been said.	Nulla id dictum est.
You are a man.	Homo es.
But he loves you.	Sed te amat .
I just do my work.	Ego iustus facio opus meum.
But he was before him.	Sed erat ante ipsum.
I didn't know this could be done.	Nesciebam hoc fieri posse.
There was no problem.	Non erat quaestio.
He gave him little time.	Parum ei tempus dedit.
You're not me.	Non mihi non es.
It's hard to give money.	Pecuniam dare difficile est.
He does not make friends.	Amicos non facit.
Not as he will, but as.	Ut non velit, sed ut.
Who did it for us.	Qui pro nobis fecit.
To-morrow that's the same before.	Cras id ipsum ante.
But this is not a good time.	Sed hoc non est tempus bonum.
But he did not do this.	Sed hoc non fecit.
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum est.
There will be time.	Tempus erit.
but perhaps because.	nisi quod fortasse.
But that's never more than that.	Sed id numquam quam.
And never before.	Et numquam ante.
if you're ready.	si paratus es.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
Still, still.	Adhuc, adhuc.
But perhaps there was nothing to do.	Fortasse verum erat nihil facere.
I could not speak to him any more.	Non potui ei amplius dicere.
yes it was good.	Etiam non erat bonum.
I really wasn't.	Ego vere non erat.
I don't like to be seen.	Non placet videri.
I thought you were coming alone.	Solus te venire putabam.
You're here and it's enough.	Hic es et satis est.
But there's another thing too.	Sed aliud ibi quoque.
That's between you and him.	Id inter te et illum.
Yes exactly.	Ita prorsus.
There is no life.	Non est vivere.
Yes but for yourself.	Etiam sed enim ipsum.
perhaps we are still alive.	fortasse adhuc sumus.
Good to have you with us.	Bonum habere te nobiscum.
I also wonder what it will be like.	Miror etiam quid simile erit.
I don't get any out.	Ut nec aliquam ex.
I don't want to talk to him.	Nolo eum loqui.
I'd like to hear about it.	Libet audire de eo.
We are also great.	Etiam magna sumus.
Whether he was prepared.	Erat paratus utrum.
If anyone doesn't like it, well.	Si quis non placet, bene.
That's pretty much it.	Id ita fere.
So you can never be sure.	Sic certe numquam certus esse potes.
not so bad.	Non tam malum.
I hope to see you again.	Spero iterum videre.
I really like video.	Ego vere amo video.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
No one does it himself.	Nemo id ipsum.
Please be happy.	Sis felix.
Just don't do anything.	Sicut non aliquid.
could not travel.	iter facere potuit.
Everything is pretty good.	Omnia satis bona.
I'll tell you what.	Dicam quod.
He buys	Emit.
Please be on time.	Sis in tempore.
Don't do it.	Noli facere.
Tomorrow but before	Cras sed ante ante.
I don't go to school.	Non ad scholam.
He did it again.	Iterum fecit.
But you do this.	Sed hoc facis.
You and me can talk.	Tu et me loqui potes.
I have to find it.	Habeo invenire eam.
Being busy is good.	Occupatus bonus.
I hope you're able to understand.	Spero te posse intelligere.
Same thing for you all.	Idem pro omnibus vobis.
All right.	Omnia recte.
It is in that night.	In nocte illa est.
But it is in him.	Sed in est ipsum.
That's some great things.	Ut aliquam magna magna.
That's how he knows.	Id quomodo scit.
Not out of it.	Non ex enim.
No it was great, though.	Nulla in erat magna, sed.
That's not always.	Quod non semper.
One at a time.	Unum tempore.
I hope you don't ever have to do that again.	Spero te non semper habere quod facere iterum.
But still there is no need.	Sed tamen non est opus.
That's all else.	Totum illud aliud est.
None or no statement.	Nulla vel dictum nulla.
He knew he ought not to do this.	Sciebat hoc non debere.
You didn't tell me about it yesterday.	Non indicavit mihi de te et heri eius.
he loves his job.	officium suum amat.
I never said much about anything.	Numquam multum de aliquo dixit.
Yes, it wasn't always.	Etiam non semper erat.
It was truly something.	Vere erat aliquid.
Nothing ever really happened to anyone.	Nihil umquam vere cum aliquo factum est.
Even not to him.	Etiam nec ipsum.
Yes you perhaps.	Etiam tu fortasse.
It's time to say nothing.	Aliquam et dictum nisi.
I like home.	Mihi placet domi.
There will be.	Ibi erit.
I don't see how he can do it.	Non video quomodo id possit.
This is exactly true.	Ita prorsus verum est.
We can't do nothing.	Non possumus facere nihil.
I feel pretty bad as stated.	Sentio satis malum sicut dictum est.
It could have been what he did yesterday.	Fieri potuit quod heri fecit.
I could not hear anything.	Aliquid audire non potui.
She wants us to go tonight.	Illa hac nocte ire nos vult.
I can't be with you.	Non possum tecum esse.
It could have been there for years.	Annos ibi esse potuit.
I wish that it was not.	Utinam non sit.
This could not be true.	Hoc verum esse non potuit.
nothing .	nihil .
No one yet comes.	Nemo tamen venit.
Or perhaps not.	Vel fortasse non.
You can go home now.	Nunc domum ire potes.
He was alone.	Solus erat.
That's not true at all.	Quod non est verum in omnibus.
In the house	In domum.
I just don't see how.	Modo non video quomodo.
It was done before.	Ante factum est.
You need to know something.	Scire debes aliquid.
The father is one.	Pater unus est.
I want you to do this.	Volo te hoc facere.
Maybe he understood.	Fortasse intellexit.
You can do everything this way.	Sic omnia potes.
But neither was there.	Sed nec erat erat.
You can believe.	Credere potes.
You can always do something new.	Semper aliquid novi facere potes.
I said this.	id dixi.
That's never been here.	Id numquam hic.
That was done, but not often.	Quod factum est, sed non saepe.
It's not here.	Est hic non es.
He came here.	Hic venit.
My family was good.	Genus meum bonum erat.
We are all men.	Omnes homines sumus.
There was something wrong, though.	Aliquid mali fuit, sed.
It is true.	Verum est.
and yet in some way he is still here;	et tamen aliquo modo adhuc hic est;
Who gave advice.	Qui consilium dedit.
Or maybe he just came.	Vel fortasse iustus venit.
We both think so.	Ambo nos puto.
We are with you!	Tecum sumus!
That was how it was.	Ut id erat erat.
Not really, but as well.	Non vere, sed ut bene.
This is not so.	Nec hoc ita est.
Maybe not before him.	Aliquam nec ipsum ante.
I have nothing but great things to say about him.	De eo nihil habeo nisi magna dicere.
No one looked at him.	Nemo videbatur.
It was much better.	Multo melius fuit.
He did that often.	Fecit ut saepe.
And you want more.	Et vis amplius.
He did what he did of his own.	Fecit quod de suo fecit.
yes there is no need.	Etiam non est opus.
yes it is not said.	Etiam non dictum est.
We are the same people.	Idem homines sumus.
I haven't had one time.	Non habuit unum tempus.
We are all men.	Omnes homines sumus.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
I probably already forgot about it.	Probabiliter iam oblitus est de me.
This morning it is.	Hic mane est.
I only know what you are.	Tantum scio quod tu es.
I don't want to talk to you.	Nolo tecum loqui.
Maybe he could say nothing.	Fortasse nihil dicere potuit.
None to him.	Nulla ad ipsum.
If you are not, tell me.	Si non es, dic.
But that's not the same thing.	Sed id nulla ipsum.
It just looks better than it looks.	Hoc modo melius videtur spectat.
Great post, though.	Magna post, sed.
I want you to stay with me tonight.	Volo te hac nocte manere apud me.
You can't do all things, but you can do anything.	Omnia non potes, sed aliquid potes.
Maybe not.	Aliquam non.
I don't want to be without you.	Sine te esse nolo.
That was your first time.	Ut sit amet tempus erat.
He does so.	Ita facit.
I want people to be able to find work.	Volo homines opus invenire posse.
We can't be all things to all.	Non omnia omnibus esse possumus.
It was not so at all.	Ita omnino non fuit.
Money doesn't get bad.	Pecuniam non habet malum.
Maybe not very likely.	Fortasse parum probabile.
The thing has not been seen.	Res iam non videtur.
As we said.	Sicut nobis dictum est.
It was enough for him.	Sibi satis esse.
Here and now.	Hic et nunc.
He thought that it was something which he could receive.	Putabat se esse aliquid quod accipere posset.
yes or big out.	Etiam vel magna ex.
Not without you.	Non sine te.
I wanted this in myself.	Hoc volui in me.
We are alone here.	Solus hic sumus.
And never let him down.	Et ipsum numquam.
The work was done.	Opus erat.
But it is great.	Sed magna est.
There is something else that you need to know.	Est aliquid aliud quod scire debes.
It was late.	Nuper erat.
Or not going.	Vel non eat.
So I know nothing.	Ita ut nihil novi.
I just didn't know about it.	Ego iustus de eo nesciebam.
If he could, he can.	Si posset, potest.
can help you get what you want.	Potest auxilium tibi id quod vis.
.	.
but I did not wish to think much.	sed non valde volui cogitare.
In that period of time.	In id tempus quam.
You should know this already.	Hoc iam scire debes.
he could not stop.	prohibere non potuit.
When he wants.	Cum velit.
I really like it.	Ego vere amo eam.
That's all today.	Id hodie omnia.
Tell me what you like and I don't like it.	Dic mihi quid libet, et non placet.
Something seems.	Aliquid videtur.
You have done well.	Bene fecisti.
Nor do we.	Nec nos.
You need to do whatever you want.	Facere debes quod vis.
I like it now.	Placet hoc nunc.
Nothing more will happen with him.	Nihil amplius cum eo futurum est.
He saw it done right there.	Ibi recte fieri vidit.
Maybe it was or was.	Aliquam vel erat erat.
why can't I know.	quare scire non possum.
It began next year.	Proximo anno incepit.
Now be very happy.	Nunc sit amet ipsum.
To be able to do the thing.	Rem facere posse.
Back to the office.	Ad officium.
Almost everything.	Fere fere omnia.
Or perhaps he doesn't.	Vel fortasse non facit.
If it were, he would do it all.	Si esset, omnes faceret.
often they are not.	Saepe non sunt.
He will do the same.	Hoc idem facturus est.
I only had good things to say.	Tantum habuit bona dicere.
You must have done well.	Debes bene fecisse.
He did not do this.	Hoc non fecit.
Even more than ever.	Etiam nec semper quam.
The best way to do this was at home.	Optime faciendum erat domi.
Look at what he does.	Quod cum facit, vide.
He didn't know, he wasn't sure.	Nesciebat, certe non erat.
He thinks, but not for long.	Cogitat, sed non diu.
There was no one to help me.	Nemo erat, qui me adiuvet.
Yes, exactly.	Ita est, prorsus.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
I just don't appreciate.	Modo non bene.
I want to see everything.	Volo videre omnia.
He wanted her again.	Iterum eam voluit.
He knew for sure.	Sciebat certe.
That's the time soon.	Id tempus mox.
But we can do better.	Sed melius facere possumus.
i never knew.	numquam scivi.
You do well, good.	Bene facis, bonum.
He had not been here long enough.	Hic satis diu non esset.
I doubt that it was a real name.	Dubito id verum nomen fuisse.
We are all together one day.	Nos omnes una die una.
when necessary.	cum necesse est.
And that's great.	Et id magna.
I told you already.	Dixi iam tibi.
I have a question for you.	Habeo quaestionem tibi.
We are men.	Homines sumus.
There was none here.	Hic nulla erat.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
This was good with me.	Hoc bene apud me fuit.
This has been done so far.	Hoc tantum factum est.
I could not think of nothing.	nihil cogitare potui dicere.
They are enough, but they must necessarily be.	Satis sunt, sed per se esse necesse est.
I never thought it would be so hard.	Numquam tam difficile putavi fore.
Don't get sick.	Non male facere.
and they are not evil.	et non sunt mali.
No one wants either.	Nemo vel velit.
And not much.	Et non multum.
I have something to give.	Habeo aliquid dare.
Maybe it will be enough.	Forsitan satis erit.
I can not.	non possum.
The same thing now.	Idem adhuc.
It's just a thought.	Suus iustus cogitavi.
so much I wanted.	tantum volui.
The thing is in everything.	Res in omnibus.
could not travel.	iter facere potuit.
I will say this about him.	Dicam hoc de illo.
What was being done.	Quae cum esset.
I'll do everything for you.	Faciam omnia ad te.
It is so hard to know for sure.	Tam difficile est pro certo scire.
I heard about it.	Audivi de illa.
And that's totally true.	Prorsus id quoque.
I can't be seen.	Videri non possum.
It was a good question.	Bona quaestio fuit.
I wonder what's wrong.	Miror quid mali.
What to do! 	Quid facere!
I'm always on my way.	Ego semper iter meum.
They're there.	Sunt ibi.
But it is not so difficult here.	Sed non ita difficile est hic.
The man is the counsel.	Vir est consilium.
The work is very well done.	Optime factum est opus.
Probably never could.	Probabiliter, numquam potuit.
Always, in all things.	Semper, in omnibus.
I'm not sure it's okay yet.	Non adhuc certus sum bene est.
Maybe you too.	Forsitan tu quoque.
Even not great.	Etiam non magna.
And this was quite true.	Et hoc satis verum fuit.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
But that is not the case.	Sed id ipsum non est.
It's time to have a great time.	Aliquam tempus magna.
Have something with you there.	Habere aliquid tecum ibi.
It's no problem at all.	Is est, nulla prorsus quaestio est.
It has to be with me.	Habet esse mecum.
Very important indeed.	Ipsum magna quidem.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
I need to know these things to do my job.	Haec scire debeo ad officium meum faciendum.
There was none in him.	Nulla in ipsum erat.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
There was none in him.	Nulla in ipsum erat.
But who is always more than that.	Sed quis semper quam.
This is not working for us.	Hoc opus non est nobis.
That's me again.	Id me iterum.
I certainly am a man.	Ego certe homo sum.
He knew he was going to do something.	Sciebat se aliquid facturum.
Everything about everything.	Omnia de omnibus.
No one is sure.	Nemo est certus.
But not as much as the same thing.	Sed non quam id ipsum.
I can see nothing about him.	Nihil de eo videre possum.
There was still something wrong.	Adhuc erat aliquid mali.
It is time.	Tempus est.
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
Looks the same to me.	Spectat idem ad me.
He didn't know or understood.	Nesciebat vel intellexit.
He could not stop himself now.	Se nunc prohibere non potuit.
I need to leave.	Opus est relinquere.
He understood about him.	Intellexit de illo.
It is with .	Est cum .
He has no certainty.	Certum non habet.
Why that is, no one knows at all.	Quare id est, nemo prorsus novit.
I tried to speak.	loqui conatus sum.
It wasn't exactly.	Non erat prorsus.
Who doesn't have time.	Quis tempus non.
That's some.	Id aliquam.
Really, well done.	Vere, bene factum est.
Yes, it is how you need to think about it.	Ita est, quomodo de eo cogitare opus est.
That's good to hear.	Quod est bonum, audire.
I was not there.	Non ibi eram.
To you all.	Vobis, omnibus.
Maybe the morning will be better.	Forsitan melius mane erit.
We need it.	Nobis opus est.
Maybe someone great.	Aliquam quis magna.
Even more than ever.	Etiam semper quam.
Let's name it as before.	Sit nomen ut ante.
It was better than last year.	Proximo anno melius fuit.
yet he saw.	vidit tamen.
This is too soon.	Hoc nimium cito.
It should be enough.	Debet esse satis.
I haven't forgotten yet.	Non oblitus tamen.
When she was home.	Quae cum domi esset.
I know them all.	Novi omnes.
Maybe it was the same thing now.	Fortasse idem nunc esset.
He comes when he comes.	Venit cum venit.
Everything about that.	Omnia ut.
I'm a busy person.	Im occupatus homo.
For it is his act.	Est enim eius agere.
It does not appear.	Non videtur.
Please, please read through your book.	Quaeso, quaeso, librum tuum per.
He did it badly.	Male eum fecit.
I don't know whether it is so.	Nescio an ita sit.
You'd be better.	Melius esse velis.
This can take a long time.	Quod ut diu videri potest.
I appreciate some help.	Ego aliquo auxilio bene.
He is gone, you know.	Abiit, scis.
But this does not appear.	Sed hoc non videtur.
Maybe that's what the job is about.	Forsitan quod officium est de.
All this here.	Hoc totum hic.
and got me	et obtinuit me.
She was very good to me.	Mihi valde bonus fuit.
You do the job.	Facis officium.
This is mine.	Hoc meum est.
But as there was none.	Sed ut nulla erat.
You can't get it.	Te habere non potest.
I feel more.	plus sentio.
And this is what he did.	Et hoc ipsum est quod fecit.
He says it's fun.	Dicit amet est.
I feel the same.	Idem sentio.
He is a boy.	Puer est.
This is where the future is.	Hoc est ubi futurum est.
Must see home.	Domum suam videre debet.
None of that either.	Eius nulla vel.
But he could not do this.	Sed hoc facere non potuit.
He can't help.	Ipse adiuvare non potest.
Scroll for video.	Librum pro video.
I could not believe it.	Credere non potui.
There is none in him.	Nulla in ipsum nulla.
It was said to you.	Dictum est tibi.
As he knew he didn't want to.	Sicut sciebat se nolebat.
Today can take a lot.	Hodie multum potest accipere.
There is something in it.	Est aliquid in illo.
May take a little while.	Sit ut paulo.
i want to stay.	manere volo.
Truly he did it.	Vere fecit.
I need a little help.	Paulo auxilio mihi opus est.
Truly he did it.	Vere fecit.
You said to me already.	Dixisti mihi iam.
We are enough.	Nos satis sumus.
It looks good.	Spectat bonum.
That's not what he wanted to hear.	Non est quod audire voluit.
Just for the day.	Modo ad diem.
I don't want to say much.	Nolo dicere valde.
Let him be himself.	Sit ipsum.
They don't stay the same.	Non idem manere.
I like .	Mihi placet .
We are in three years.	Nos sumus in annos tres.
To be somewhat	Esse aliquam.
True obligation.	Verum officium.
I didn't know who or who it was.	Nesciebam quis vel quis sit.
I don't like talking about you.	Non placet mihi de te loquitur.
I want to talk to you about it.	de illo tecum loqui volo.
All things are all here.	Omnia hic sunt omnia.
But rightly so far as it is.	Sed recte, quantum est.
About me and you.	De me et te.
Great time was great.	Nunc magna erat magna.
But he can't do it wrong.	Sed male non potest.
Talk to each other a lot.	Multum ad se loqui.
He could not.	Non potuit.
He said he wanted to talk to me.	Dixit se velle mecum loqui.
To-morrow in the quarters.	Cras in erat.
No no no.	Non nulla non est.
not in the morning.	Non mane.
This time only my real name is.	Hoc solum tempore verum est nomen meum.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
Maybe there was no wish.	Aliquam non erat velit.
He said enough indeed.	Satis id quidem dixit.
what you will do.	quod facturus.
Which indeed he does well.	Quod quidem bene facit.
I think better than he.	Melius puto quam ille.
But however.	Sed tamen.
I saw him.	Vidi eum.
It is getting late.	Nuper questus est.
We don't need to travel.	Non opus est nobis esse iter.
I and you alone.	Ego et tu solum.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
I thought I was doing a good job.	Putavi bene facere officium.
I forgot this too.	Id quoque oblitus sum.
He still did not see her.	Adhuc non vidit eam.
Maybe he had.	Fortasse habuit.
I must go.	ire debeo.
I am alone here.	Ego solus hic sum.
I want to believe, make me believe.	Credere volo, Fac me credere.
Not well.	Nec bene.
All you need to know.	Omnes scire debes.
Well got in.	Bene obtinuit in.
I don't have any problem.	Quaestionem aliquam non habeo.
You need to give someone more time.	Debes aliquem plus temporis dare.
Yes, please.	Etiam, velit.
There with you.	Tecum ibi.
That not.	Ut non.
Thus he wished.	Sic voluit.
Time was time.	Tempus erat tempus.
You need someone to speak to you.	Opus est tibi aliquem, ut tibi dicam.
Yes it is true.	Ita verum est.
And there would be one.	Et non esset unum.
To be honest than before.	Ut sit amet quam ante.
We're still there again.	Iterum adhuc ibi sumus.
And it can be done very well indeed.	Et optime quidem potest.
Yes, there is no one.	Etiam quis nulla est.
and probably to you.	et probabiliter ad te.
This has been a long time.	Hoc diu fuit.
We never do it.	Numquam habemus id.
Thus there	Sic ibi.
Not from us.	Non a nobis.
I want to see something else.	Volo videre aliquid aliud.
I'm not sure where the problem is here.	Non sum certus ubi quaestio hic sit.
She'll be there soon.	Mox ibi erit illa.
I hope this will be enough.	Spero fore id satis.
But he loves me, he is not like a father.	Sed me amat, non est ut pater.
Now he is gone.	Nunc abiit.
He could not think of what to say, he said nothing.	Non potuit cogitare quid dicam, nihil dixit.
This is a journey.	Hoc iter est.
It was indeed.	Erat quidem.
Nothing ever.	Nihil umquam.
That was in him.	Ut in ipsum erat.
It will be good for me.	Bonum mihi erit.
But here we are together.	Sed hic sumus simul.
He never wants to be.	Numquam velit esse.
This is often possible.	Quod saepe fieri potest.
This is still a lot.	Hoc adhuc multum.
Paul could see.	Paulo videre posset .
And you are there.	Et tu ibi es.
Not sure yet how.	Non certus sed quomodo.
No one knows her.	Nemo eam novit.
There is something for everyone.	Est aliquid omnibus.
He always comes.	Semper venit.
This could not have been done.	Quod fieri non potuit.
I don't need to know, he said.	Non opus est scire, ipse dixit.
It was great, but not close.	Erat magna, sed non proxima.
The work has been done.	Opus factum est.
I can't talk like anyone.	Non possum dicere sicut quis.
Yep, a little.	Vidi, parum.
I didn't understand until this time.	Non intellexit usque ad hoc tempus.
Now what you need to know is important.	Nunc quid opus sit amet scire.
Yes, there was no time.	Etiam nec tempus erat.
It is important to take some time before.	Aliquam sit amet aliquam ante.
It was a great question.	Magna quaestio fuit.
Yes that is now.	Etiam id nunc est.
Yes, it's gonna be great.	Etiam sit amet magna.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
Nothing is better yet.	Melius tamen nihil.
The father has to go.	Pater ire habet.
he did well.	bene fecit.
perhaps rightly so.	recte fortasse.
It may not be so.	Forsitan non ita esse.
He could not accept it.	Non potuit accipere.
i thought it was necessary.	ut necesse putavi.
You can go to all people.	Ad omnes homines potes.
That's when he saw it.	Id cum vidit.
But he came.	Sed venit.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
I've never seen anything like it before.	Numquam ante aliquid simile vidi.
Yes, that's always how, and it has been said.	Etiam id semper quam, et dictum est.
Even those who are none other than me.	Etiam qui nulla nisi me.
That was true.	Quod erat verum.
I always wanted to stay here.	Hic semper manere volui.
But not right.	Sed non recte.
Good day with that.	Cum illo die bene.
I could not hear anything.	Aliquid audire non potui.
He almost never did it at all.	Numquam fere omnino fecit.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
It is.	Sic est.
But nothing of it.	Sed nihil ex eo.
Maybe he didn't.	Fortasse non habuit.
I said nothing either.	nihil vel dixi.
It is still fixed.	Certum est usque.
You have him.	Habes eum.
He could only think of what it was like.	Cogitare tantum potuit quid similis esset.
This is not enough work.	Non satis hoc opus est.
But it was always too much of me.	Sed nimium semper erat a me.
It was a story in itself.	Aliquam in ipsum erat.
I'm good either way.	Im bonus vel modo.
To say something.	Ut aliquid.
i like it.	ut eam ego.
I know it's true.	Scio verum esse.
It is not great.	Non magna.
Don't stay up late.	Non de sero manere.
Maybe it's time to save.	Aliquam id tempus nisi.
He should .	Debet .
Its great.	Eius magna.
I like the way you said your first name, though.	Placet modo primum nomen dixisti, sed.
The man is good enough.	Vir satis est.
But that was not the same thing.	Sed id ipsum non erat.
It would be something else.	Esset aliquid aliud.
This will not be correct.	Hoc recte non erit.
But there	Sed ibi.
They are already there.	Iam sunt.
What's better today than yesterday is gone.	Quid melius hodie quam heri abiit.
I can do it if I don't have the time.	Id facere possum si tempus non habes.
You can live here if you want.	Vivere hic potes si vis.
I feel the same.	Idem sentio.
You have advice too.	Habes etiam consilium.
yesterday, today and tomorrow.	heri et hodie et cras.
I still know where he is.	adhuc scio ubi sit.
I've never done this before.	Nunquam ante hoc fecit.
Too little too late.	Quoque paulo nimium sero.
If there is a child.	Si puer est.
He would not be here.	Noluit hic.
yes not always yourself.	Etiam non semper ipsum.
No one can see anything.	Nemo quicquam videre potest'.
I would not hear.	Nolui audire.
It is important for the company.	Aliquam sit amet enim erat.
He told me today.	Dixit mihi hodie.
He doesn't say much that he can't.	Non multum dicit quod non potest.
And as has been said.	Et ut dictum est.
We all need help.	Auxilium nobis opus est omnibus.
That was not enough for me.	Parum mihi id fuit.
You know pretty bad, for sure.	Malum satis scis, certe.
But in this there is but little.	Verum in hoc parum est.
This is the plan.	Hoc consilium.
If it is, here it is.	Si est, hic est.
Well you need to know what this is.	Bene scire debes quid de hoc sit.
He ate it himself.	Hoc ipsum comedit.
It was my job.	Meum erat officium.
Not sure how.	Non certus quomodo.
It looked good with him.	Videbatur bene cum illo.
how glad I am	quam gaudeo.
There was nothing thinking about it.	Nihil erat quod cogitas.
I'm not all good with him even now.	Non sum omnia bona cum illo etiam nunc.
As stated in the report.	Ut in dictum ipsum.
This is really good.	Hoc vere bonum est.
I could see.	videre potui.
You have everything you need here.	Habes omnia quae hic opus sunt.
He's still alive.	Hic adhuc est.
I can't see.	Non possum videre.
But not now.	Sed nec nunc.
I like to be married.	Mihi placet esse uxorem.
But not always in all things.	Sed in omnibus non semper.
This has been done recently.	Hoc nuper factum est.
I don't need to understand him.	Non opus est intelligere se.
I heard about him.	de illo audivi.
So often, but not always.	Sic saepe, sed non semper.
Nothing save us.	Nihil nos nisi.
I'm sorry, everyone.	Paenitet me, omnes.
You are always.	Tu semper es.
But not long after.	Sed non multo post.
It is necessary at about three in the morning.	Fere tres mane necesse est.
She does not even know why he was here.	Ne haec quidem scit cur hic esset.
I'm here for lunch.	Hic sum ad prandium.
I see what you want.	Video quid velis.
Maybe just scared.	Fortasse mox vix.
And, as you know, you can do this.	Et, ut scis, hoc facere potes.
He didn't want to go.	Noluit ire.
I'm glad that he's here.	Gaudeo quod hic est.
But yet another.	Sed tamen aliud.
But he could not believe it enough.	Non potuit tamen satis credere.
Yes that's for now.	Etiam id nunc enim.
And he said to him.	Et dixit ei.
That's it before.	Ut id ante est.
Even if not, it is absolutely true.	Etiam si non, verum omnino est.
It never happened, it never did.	Numquam factum est, numquam fuit.
or if I wanted to understand a little.	vel si parum intelligere volui.
And there are people who do.	Et sunt qui facere.
That is the time.	Ut sit tempus.
This has never happened to me before.	Hoc nunquam ante me factum est.
But to who rather than.	Sed ut quis quam.
This was what I did.	Hoc erat quod me fecit.
It's time to take time for yourself.	Aliquam ut tempus ipsum.
I am indebted to you.	Debeo.
I am my nationality.	Ego genus meum.
It is absolutely necessary.	Omnino necesse est.
This works well.	Hoc bene.
It is not easy.	Non facile.
neither does he have.	nec habet.
To always ask for.	Ut a semper enim.
But I see something else entirely.	Sed aliud omnino videre.
The boy is very nice.	Puer admodum.
Not for .	Non pro .
I've never met one.	Nunquam occurrit unus.
Don't say anything.	Noli dicere.
He is there with you.	Ibi tecum est.
Thus he speaks.	Sic loquitur.
I had to see.	videre habui.
But it will be fine.	Sed bene erit.
He did not come in one day.	Non venit in una die.
I am very pleased with this job.	Hoc officium admodum sum.
I have nothing to say to you today.	Nihil habeo quod dicam tibi hodie.
This may or may not be.	Hoc potest vel non esse.
Which never happened.	Quae numquam.
Yes that's how important it is.	Etiam id quam sit amet quam.
And one good thing.	Bonum autem unum.
And it seems both.	Et videtur utrumque.
There will be time.	Tempus erit.
Never be the same again.	Numquam idem iterum.
He knew what was there.	Sciebat quid ibi esset.
There was none in none.	Nulla in nulla erat.
Talk to someone.	Loqui cum aliquo.
You are with me.	Tu mecum es.
Talk to someone to talk to.	Loqui aliquem dicere.
Well, still no one knows.	Bene, adhuc nemo scit.
But not always.	Sed nec semper.
You mean that too often.	Vis, ut et saepe.
I wasn't sure that.	Quod certe non eram.
Sorry for not being able to have dinner.	Nos paenitet nos cenam habere non posse.
He did it for us.	Is nobis fecit.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
Certainly throughout the day.	Per diem certe.
He could not do it.	Non potuit ei id facere.
but he asked.	sed rogavit.
I know you're really busy.	Scio te esse vere occupatus.
And so this will be the time.	Sic et hoc tempus erit.
I've seen him.	Ego eum vidi.
I like it very much.	Mihi valde placet.
That's how he thinks right now.	Id quomodo nunc putat.
No it's not.	Nemo non eam.
And that .	Et quod .
They are already here.	Iam hic sunt.
But this is not so.	Sed hoc non est ita.
But it is better than nothing.	Sed melius quam nihil est.
All about three.	Omnes fere tres.
You do at home.	Domi facis.
therefore when in later.	quare cum in post.
In order to love yourself.	In ut ipsum.
I wish it would happen again.	Iterum volo futurum.
He knew that he was good.	Sciebat se bonum esse.
What do you want from me.	Quid vis a me.
This day was one.	Hac die unus erat.
So he did not.	Ita non habuit.
Do all things!	Omnia fac!.
He gave me nothing.	Nihil mihi dedit.
You know for sure.	Scis certe.
But either way cannot be.	Utrumque autem modo non potest esse.
He was alone.	Solus pro- erat.
These things are good.	Haec bona sunt.
You said to us.	Dixisti nobis.
He refused to see.	Noluit videre.
He must remain the same.	Idem manere debet.
today was not that day.	hodie non fuit ille dies.
You really need it.	Vere opus est.
You can swim at all.	Omnino natare potes.
He also knew the truth.	Sciebat etiam verum.
Yes, it is, it is.	Etiam, est, est.
The man could not.	Homo non potuit.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
But that's great right now.	Sed id magna nunc.
That's not what you want.	Quod ne quid vis.
That's all there.	Id omnes ibi.
He only knows what he has done.	Solus scit quid fecerit.
He always has and always wills.	Semper habet et semper vult.
He was so good to us.	Erat nobis bonus.
We just won't be.	Nos iustus non erit.
He does this for all.	Hoc facit omnibus.
But he was a man.	Sed homo erat.
But there was no time.	Sed tempus non erat.
But now it was him.	Nunc sed erat ipsum.
We're always busy.	Semper in occupatus sumus.
Just a guy.	Iustus guy.
He didn't want her to go.	Noluit eam ire.
He knows the journey well.	Iter bene novit.
No one yet seems to do this.	Nemo tamen hoc facere videtur.
She really is very happy.	Vere sit amet illa.
Yes, but that's how.	Etiam id nisi quam.
I love him as you do.	Ego illum amo, ut facis.
Even as important as before.	Etiam ut magna ante.
He is the same.	Ipse est.
This has been a year already.	Hic iam anno fuit.
I could do a lot better.	Multum melius facere potui.
There is no need to say.	Nihil opus est dicere.
Do whatever you like best.	Fac quod tibi placet facias.
But this is not easy.	Sed hoc non est facile.
Well, we can do this.	Bene, hoc facere possumus.
I could do it.	id potui.
There was no need.	Non opus erat.
And they are not.	Et non sunt.
It was already too much.	Jam nimium erat.
This is very bad.	Valde hoc malum est.
If not today, tomorrow	Si non hodie, cras est.
You have done your job.	Fecisti officium tuum.
He thinks and is a man.	Cogitat, et homo est.
Nothing seems to be wrong.	Nihil mali esse videtur.
There's nothing like it at first.	Primum nihil simile.
You are so good tonight.	Tam bonus es nocte.
I rejoice.	gaudeo.
Neither that nor the same.	Nec id nec ipsum.
Now that was said.	Nunc id dictum erat.
And he himself also knew it.	Et ipse quoque sciebat.
It is not .	Non est .
They don't help themselves.	Sibi non auxilium.
He could learn nothing from him.	Nihil ex eo scire potuit.
They are very close.	Proxima sunt.
It will happen again tonight.	Etiam hac nocte futurum est.
He told me so.	Dixit mihi sic.
This is certain.	Hoc certum est.
No it is none.	Nulla id nulla est.
Look how you like.	Vide quomodo libet.
This, however, was not.	Hoc tamen non fuit.
A good name is not easy.	Bonum nomen non est facile.
I want to tell you	Volo te dicere .
I know this for sure.	Hoc pro certo scio.
Too much time	Nimium tempus .
let him be who he is.	Sit qui sit.
You can never stop believing.	Numquam prohibere potes credere.
And it is the same with me.	Et idem est apud me.
Yes I am.	Ita sum.
Nothing has yet been done.	Nihil adhuc factum est.
He does the same.	Idem ipse facit.
No it is none.	Nulla id nulla est.
That's what we need.	Id quod nobis opus est.
I don't mean to be.	Non vult esse.
I feel prepared.	Paratus sentio.
I wanted something too.	Aliquid etiam esse volui.
No one wants it.	Nulla id velit.
We can believe nothing here.	Hic nihil possumus credere.
The father is as never there.	Pater est, ut numquam ibi.
You know nothing.	Nihil scis.
This was his first job.	Hoc primum officium eius fuit.
I don't even feel it.	Ego ne id quidem sentio.
I can't say you're right there either.	Non possum dicere te ibi esse vel recte.
Maybe he was a father.	Fortasse pater fuit.
As to .	Ut ad .
You don't have? 	Non habes?
But yesterday	Sed heri .
Not even the same.	Ne ipsum quidem.
There is so much work.	Tantum opus non est.
It was too late.	Nimis sero erat.
He refused to talk with her.	Noluit loqui cum illa.
I'm happy but.	Sum felix, sed.
Leave yourself alone.	Te solum relinquere.
I don't love you much, really.	Non multum amo, vere.
Maybe it was nothing.	Aliquam non erat nisi.
I am yet another	Ego adhuc aliud sum.
This thing doesn't seem bad.	Res hic non videtur malum.
I don't want to say it now.	Nolo id nunc dicere.
That's just good.	Sic tantum bonum,.
I need to think over that.	Debeo cogitare in illo.
He did not do it himself.	Non se id.
See if you can in any way.	Vide si aliquo modo potes.
I'm busy here.	Hic sum occupatus.
She never saw me.	Illa numquam me vidit.
There is no order now.	Nulla ut nunc est.
He had him.	Habuit eum.
If you want to do it, do it.	Si vis facere, fac.
And perhaps rightly so.	Et fortasse recte.
I just didn't want to believe it.	Modo nolebat credere.
But he could do nothing about it.	Sed nihil de eo facere potuit.
There is no need.	Nihil opus est.
Which is behind us.	Quod post nos est.
I'm pretty sure that's it.	Satis certo scio suus id esse.
But it was enough.	Sed satis erat.
Who or how to use.	Vel quis quam ut.
It was for us.	Erat nobis.
That was it.	Id erat.
I did my job totally.	Prorsus officium meum feci.
i know how to play.	ludere scio.
No one is alone.	Nemo est solus.
I'll tell you that.	Dicam illud.
This was not true.	Hoc non erat verum.
Certainly, you are.	Certe, tu es.
He could not stop.	Non potuit prohibere.
He could not leave at the same time.	Simul relinquere non potuit.
I'm so glad you didn't.	Tam gaudeo te non esse.
This one is too much.	Hoc unum nimium.
I don't feel it.	Non sentio.
If you'd like, you can come to me.	Si velis, potes ad me venire.
You just do too much.	Tu nimium iustus facis.
Me indeed.	Me quidem.
That's very happy for you.	Ut sit amet enim ipsum.
I don't think much.	Non multum puto.
You know it could be done.	Scis non potuit.
You know, you can get married.	Scis, posse uxorem.
But so does it all.	Sed sic habet omnes.
It was too much.	Nimium erat.
But you don't want to do this.	Sed hoc facere non vis.
No one knows but us.	Nemo scit nisi nos.
But I don't think that much.	Sed non putat id multum.
I did one today.	Ego feci hodie unum.
What you have.	Quod habes.
he said.	dixit.
and he has.	et habet.
I was one.	unus eram.
He could not do more.	Non potuit plus.
I hope that's not going to happen to me.	Spero quod mihi non erit futurum.
But we are not all in this together.	Sed non omnes in hoc simul sumus.
I don't think it works at all.	Omnino opus non puto.
-non.	-non.
All things go.	Omnia omnia proficisci.
It was a great thing.	Multum erat aliquid.
And my father	Et pater meus .
He could have, but could not.	Potuit habere, sed non potuit.
It is important for you.	Aliquam sit amet enim et.
You can see me well.	Potes videre bene mihi.
He knew this.	Hoc scivit.
He is not there.	Non est ibi.
You'll never get to that yourself.	Numquam ad id ipsum.
I can barely see.	Vix videre possum.
You are what you can be.	Tu quod potes esse.
But this is not seen.	Quod tamen non videtur.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
it is not his.	non est suum.
Not now, but.	Non iam, sed.
This is what anyone is like.	Hoc est quod quis similis est.
But that's almost enough.	Sed id fere satis est.
I hope you all can come to us.	Spero te omnes ad nos venire posse.
If you want, you can come with me.	Si vis, potes mecum venire.
But you're ready.	Sed es paratus.
The only person to say this.	Solus homo hoc dicere.
Don't take anything for sure.	Noli quicquam pro certo accipere.
But there is one thing as always.	Sed unum est ut semper.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
To find your job.	Invenire tuum.
I can have myself and be fine with it.	Non possum habere me et esse bene cum illo.
He didn't want you.	Noluit te .
i know enough to do.	satis scio facere.
I never thought it would happen.	Numquam putavi fore.
That is, he did it.	Id est, fecit.
I always thought time would come.	Semper putavi tempus futurum.
Good teacher.	Magister bonus.
But not just for me.	Sed non solum mihi.
At last he was home.	Tandem domi erat.
But we cannot.	Sed non possumus.
That which may be true, or cannot be.	Quod ut verum est, vel non potest esse.
Only three cars.	Tres tantum currus.
Not to something, not even to someone.	Non ad aliquid, ne ab aliquo quidem.
Tomorrow was the day	Cras erat dies.
They are very human.	Nimis homines sunt.
In fact, that is it.	Quidem ut eius sit.
Certainly I forgot.	Certe oblitus sum.
Now to yourself now.	Nunc ut ipsum nunc.
I have a book like this too.	Librum habeo simile hoc quoque.
You'll never get hurt.	Numquam te malum.
Not there yet.	Non adhuc ibi.
I feel so alone.	Sic ego sentio solus.
He does not act.	Non agit.
I have seen you.	Vidi te.
You are not.	Non es.
He is gone again.	Abiit iterum.
If it is not, it will probably not.	Si non sit, verisimile non erit.
It's probably not enough.	Probabiliter non est satis.
Maybe there is always none.	Aliquam semper nulla est.
Yes, from him, yes.	Ita, ex eo, sic.
By this we are all.	Per hoc omnes sumus.
he could never	numquam potuit .
And something else, not right.	Et aliud aliquid, non recte.
It's me.	Est mihi.
I think of him.	Illum puto.
Now it's me.	Nunc in me est.
It was hardly likely.	Vix verisimile erat.
Not all.	Non omnes.
I have it again.	iterum me habeo.
Both are correct.	Utrumque recte.
You are exactly what you did.	Prorsus es quod te fecit.
Well that was it.	Bene id erat.
The day is again.	Dies est iterum.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
He does so.	Ita facit.
Well, maybe it's still time.	Bene, fortasse adhuc tempus est illud.
Maybe or never before.	Aliquam vel numquam quam.
This is my plan.	Hoc consilium meum est.
A must have.	A habere debet.
Really be honest.	Vere sit amet.
None of the said no.	Nulla a dictum nulla.
He knew it was not true.	Sciebat non esse verum.
and they are.	et sunt.
He saw enough.	Satis ille vidit.
I thought so too.	Ita etiam cogitavi.
No great results from here.	Nulla hic magna ex.
Of us certainly.	De nobis certe.
Who he is.	Eum esse quis.
perhaps he is.	forsitan ipse est.
We all have.	Nos omnes habemus.
Yes, that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum est.
I am a good man.	Sum vir bonus.
I can't think of it now.	Non possum de eo nunc cogitare.
I can say the truth, but it is difficult.	Verum dicere possum, verum difficile.
How you are.	Quomodo sis.
You're totally right about this.	Prorsus recte de hoc es.
Or to be happy.	Vel esse felix.
But it was not for her.	Sed ad eam non erat.
he saw all things.	vidit omnia.
He does not know.	Nescit.
Look at me again.	Iterum me vide.
And in here.	Et in hic.
He is not going.	Non eat.
But perhaps it is better in this way.	Sed hoc modo melius fortasse est.
In, in, please.	In, in, velit.
It's not there, you know.	Non est ibi, scis.
He would not live like this.	Sic vivere noluit.
Which has nothing to do with this.	Quod nihil ad hoc.
It was yesterday and today is.	Erat heri, et hodie est.
You can only as much as you can.	Tantum potes quantum potes.
There was none in none.	Nulla in nulla erat.
But it was not that.	Sed non erat id.
He saw them all.	Vidit omnes.
There are certainly.	Sunt certe.
No more than that said.	Nulla id dictum quam.
And there is a lot you can do.	Et multum est quod facere potes.
All you need to do is do it.	Omnes opus facere est facere.
I still have that problem.	Adhuc habeo quod quaestio.
And this is .	Et hoc est .
I saw him tonight.	Vidi eum hac nocte.
I've heard it now.	Audivi modo.
None in was out.	Nulla in erat ex.
I don't want to see him tonight.	Nolo illum videre hac nocte.
We know what this meant.	Nos, quid hoc esset.
I've never seen anything like it before.	Numquam ante aliquid simile vidi.
We all get sick.	Omnes male.
But that was what he would not.	Sed id erat quod nolebat.
But that's before now.	Sed id nunc ante.
I have nothing against me.	Non habeo in me.
I don't know you.	Non novi te.
But nothing like it at all.	Sed nihil omnino simile.
But it is .	Sed est .
We are all	Omnes sumus .
Father too.	Pater quoque.
so that he may be there already.	ut iam ibi sit.
I could not do it now.	Id nunc facere non potui.
He thought to himself.	Putabat se.
I'll tell you now.	Dicam modo.
I don't think you need to talk.	Non opus videtur loqui.
I wish I could stop.	Utinam prohibere posset.
The same kind	Idem genus .
That's for him.	Ut in ipsum enim.
Today	Hodie .
It's almost over.	Fere in eius.
He loves me	Me amat .
Men are like us.	Homines sunt sicut nos.
and he ought to know.	et scire debet.
But let's be honest now.	Sed sit amet quam nunc.
So it's time again.	Ita est illud tempus, iterum.
It is the same with us men.	Simile est apud nos homines.
.	.
I am good.	Ego bonus sum.
It is not possible at all.	Fieri omnino non potest.
It is not difficult.	Non est difficile.
never heard of you.	numquam de te audivi.
Something comes after us.	Aliquid post nos venit.
No one seems very pleased.	Nemo videtur admodum.
yes not always.	Etiam non semper est.
Thus three men.	Ita tres homines.
I like you over there!.	Ego amo te ibi !.
In this or that way.	Hoc modo vel illo.
And well what can we say.	Et bene quid possumus dicere.
Not much, but little.	Non multum, sed parum.
It's too big for us.	Nimis magna est nobis.
Now is the time to say the time.	Nunc tempus dictum tempus.
I'll see where you got it.	Et vide ubi te obtinuit.
I'm glad to be here.	Gaudeo te hic esse.
He always did it.	Semper fecit.
And also	Et etiam .
On the whole, the journey was pretty good.	In totum, iter satis bonum.
Not everybody.	Non omnibus.
So where are we today.	Ita, ubi hodie sumus.
Something's wrong with it.	Aliquid mali in est.
I heard everything and nothing.	Omnia audivi et nihil.
So it was done.	Ita factum esset.
i'm pretty good.	Sum satis bonum est.
But not great.	Sed non magna.
The boy was in business.	Erat puer in res.
He didn't want to do that.	Noluit facere.
Now I can't help myself.	Nunc me adiuvare non possum.
They're also very good.	Sunt etiam valde bona.
You are here for me and you.	Hic es pro me et te.
No father wants to hear this.	Nemo pater hoc audire vult.
He knew where my father was.	Sciebat ubi pater meus esset.
You need to know.	Scire debes.
It could also be.	Potuit etiam esse.
That was one thing.	Erat unum illud.
it still seems to me.	adhuc mihi videtur.
I was always ready.	Semper paratus fui.
But nothing is getting through.	Sed nihil est questus per.
This was exactly the same time.	Hoc idem prorsus tempus fuit.
He didn't want things.	Noluit res.
He was out of it.	Erat ex.
He said it was mine.	Meum dixit esse.
That would work.	Quod esset opus.
We can do much better today.	Hodie multo melius facere possumus.
I was there to see.	Fui ibi videre.
I know my mom wants me to live with her.	Scio meum, velle me cum illa vivere.
And he saw him.	Et vidit eum.
We have a house, but we are not a house.	Domum habemus, sed domum non sumus.
That's not always how.	Ut non semper quam.
He does not come home.	Domum non venit.
Which seems correct.	Quod bene videtur.
Too similar now.	Nimis modo similis.
And happy day to you.	Et felix dies tibi est.
This is the case.	Hoc ita se habet.
It's always in on.	In in semper est.
I guess you can find it for yourself.	Suspicor id pro te invenire.
He was one of my favorites.	Erat unum mea.
I think it would be okay for you.	Puto fore ut tibi bene.
And boy did I do this.	Et puer hoc feci.
Too bad to see him.	Nimis ut eum.
You can do it too.	Facere etiam potes.
Rightly so.	Recte sic est.
Perhaps very good, perhaps not.	Forsitan valde bona, fortasse non sunt.
Perhaps he could not.	Nec potuit fortasse.
None of this was for us.	Nemo id erat nobis.
Please, if so.	Quaeso, si ita est.
I thought I would be right now.	Putavi fore nunc.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum.
As I always did.	Sicut semper feci.
It is still possible.	Adhuc potest.
He left her.	Qui reliquit eam.
A man could do it.	Vir eius posse facere posse.
If you want something bad enough, do it now.	Si vis aliquid mali satis, fac modo.
Not for the first time.	Nec primum.
Except when he was there.	Nisi cum erat.
But that was the time.	Sed id tempus erat.
I am not talking about right now.	Non de nunc.
Just want to say.	Iustus volo dicere.
As you said.	Sicut dixisti.
Almost never heard of it.	Fere nunquam ex quo audivi.
And what now.	Et quid nunc.
I'm not sorry.	Non me paenitet.
That you need to know everything.	Quod scire debes omnia.
Only that.	Solum id.
What is that?	Quid id sit?.
However, he is still doing the job.	Tamen adhuc officium facere.
We have to do it now.	Facere nunc habemus id.
Not me at all.	Nec me omnes.
He was in a was.	In a erat erat.
I don't know why.	Nescio quod.
This is what he does.	Hoc est quod facit.
No one is behind her.	Nemo post eam.
But I could not.	Sed non potui.
I do not want to live like this.	sic vivere nolo.
He already knows everything about you.	De te iam omnia novit.
It is not enough, nothing really.	Parum est, nihil vere.
And it does not.	Et non habet.
But now there is no need.	Sed nunc non est opus.
There is still a lot of work to be done.	Est adhuc multum opus faciendum.
This also seems to be possible.	Hoc quoque fieri posse videtur.
No one seems to know what has happened.	Quod factum est, nemo scire videtur.
Nothing bad at all.	Nihil omnino mali.
If not, it is evil.	Si non, malum est.
It's what you don't know.	Est id quod non.
As stated above, this is not true.	Ut dictum est, id non est.
You can live there well.	Ibi bene vivere potes.
as it seems.	ut videtur.
I know this for sure.	Hoc satis certo scio.
I'd like to know.	Scire libet.
That's not good.	Ut 'non est bonum.
You did it yourself.	Tu ipse fecisti.
Not very good, but.	Non bonum ipsum, sed.
Got so much work.	Tantum opus obtinuit.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
That's how things get better.	Id quomodo res melius.
He was really scared.	Vix vere erat.
He does well.	Bene facit.
He always has.	Semper habet.
He didn't think he wanted to go home.	Non putabat se domum ire velle.
Great, great, great! 	Magna, magna, magna!
.	.
But see this.	Sed hoc vide.
I think we all know that.	Omnes puto scire.
We need something new.	Aliquid novi nobis opus est.
I'd really like to know more about you.	Vellem vere scire de te.
I'd realized that.	Quod vellem intellexit.
Actually, it's not necessary at all.	Vere, omnino non opus est.
He seems to help us.	Ipse nos adiuvare videtur.
I didn't say anything else.	Nihil aliud non dixi.
I myself, I was very good.	Ego ipse, multum bonus eram.
Yes that was always.	Etiam id semper erat.
Yes it is fun how great.	Etiam sit amet quam magna.
To live is good.	Vivere bonum est.
No, you've just	Non, quam vix.
Yesterday was nothing.	Heri nihil erat.
But this was not.	Sed hoc non fuit.
I haven't come to school today yet.	Non ad scholam hodie venit, sed.
You'd like to do something about it.	Facere aliquid de illo velis.
I thought.	Cogitavi.
Or, not.	Vel, non.
i want to buy it for you.	eam tibi emere volo.
No one knows where he is.	Nemo scit ubi sit.
I don't want that.	Nolo illud.
All these things I want.	Haec omnia volo.
He was still afraid.	Erat adhuc vereor.
Which is not the same.	Quod non est idem.
I was ready to tell you everything.	paratus eram omnia tibi dicere.
It's too late.	Sero est.
Soon he knew he would be here soon.	Mox scivit, mox hic fore.
We have time.	Tempus habemus.
If you do, let me have it.	Si feceris, fac me habere.
I don't know when things are okay.	Nescio quando bene sunt.
The same with this.	Idem cum hoc.
But it was not always.	Sed non semper erat.
he was a very good boy.	erat valde bonus puer.
He wants to go home with me.	Non vult mecum domum ire.
Yes, yes, so	Sic, sic, sic.
He refused to speak at all.	Omnino loqui noluit.
I can't play guy.	Guy ludere non possum.
And never one.	Et unum numquam.
I don't want to hear anything about him.	De eo nihil audire nolo.
This could not have been done.	Quod fieri non potuit.
That's me and you.	Id me et te.
It's up to you to see how.	Est ad vos ut quomodo.
It's pretty good.	Satis bene est.
But not today.	Sed non est hodie.
I had, a.	habui, a.
No one can do it.	Nemo id facere possit.
Happy to do the job.	Felix facere officium.
He knew he was going to do it.	Sciebat se facturum esse.
But no one could do this as yet.	Sed hoc adhuc nemo facere potuit.
He, however, is the man.	Is tamen, vir.
That should not be done.	Quod fieri non debet.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
Do better.	Melius fac.
I like it anyway.	Placet tamen.
Truly it is .	Vere est .
He wanted to come and go.	Venire et ire ut voluit.
Most likely never will.	Verisimile numquam erit.
Now that's how.	Nunc ut est quam.
That where it is, it has.	Quod ubi est, habet.
You can hear your voice now.	Potes nunc tuum audire.
But it is still true.	Verum tamen est.
to do it.	ut eum faciam.
He did to you what he did for me.	Ipse tibi fecit quod pro me fecit.
Don't always do it again.	Ne semper illud.
Yes, that's what I wished I had just said.	Etiam id nunc enim erat dictum velit.
I had.	Habuit ego.
Nothing for him.	Nihil sibi.
Sure, it's enough.	Certum, satis est.
And that	Id autem .
I am always ready.	Semper paratus sum.
Now it's okay.	Nunc bene est.
You are ready.	Paratus es.
This is not the case anymore.	Hoc amplius non est.
It could have been late.	Potuit iam sero esse.
I love you too.	Te etiam amo.
he eats it.	illud comedit.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id erat ipsum.
My job is to win.	Meum officium est vincere.
I was very long ago.	Valde me diu ante.
I've seen you do that.	Ego vidi te facere.
he said what he wanted.	dixit quid vellet.
But that is none.	Sed id nulla est.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I am not for you.	non sum ad te.
yes not always for.	Etiam non semper enim.
he knew nothing.	nihil sciebat.
He was very kind.	Erat genus ipsum.
Almost there.	Ibi fere.
He did not wish.	Nec velit.
There is no such thing as yourself.	Nulla ut ipsum est.
I don't like it at all.	Non placet omnino.
It is not for you, it is not for you.	Non est tibi, non est.
But it will not be so bad.	Non ita erit malum, sed.
But not today.	Sed non hodie.
But here before.	Sed hic ante.
It's time to get yourself out.	Aliquam ut ipsum ex.
All the way.	Sic omnes.
They are always for you.	Semper sunt pro te.
Where the men are.	Ubi homines sunt.
You can see.	Videre potes.
This was not true.	Hoc non fuit.
Yours is lonely.	Tuum est solum.
Who can play it if not.	Ludere quis nisi id.
Maybe a little later.	Fortasse paulo post.
There was no problem.	Nulla erat quaestio.
Look that way.	Vide illuc.
Or before?	An ante quam?
We can always find each other.	Id semper inter se invenire possumus.
I am definitely longer than you.	Mihi certe diutius quam tibi.
But none of them is right.	Nemo tamen de omnibus recte est.
We do this here and now.	Hoc nos huc et nunc.
It is important that you do so.	Aliquam sit amet quam id.
Please never need it.	Numquam quaeso opus est.
But the future.	Sed futurum.
He understood everything now.	Intellexit nunc omnia.
I don't do anything.	Non aliquid faciam.
None in which he was.	Nulla in quam erat.
Something was wrong.	Malum aliquid erat.
But he's coming to you.	Hic tamen ad te venit.
It's all done for me.	Mihi totum factum est.
I don't like it at all.	Mihi omnino non placet.
You have to plan ahead.	Habes consilium ut ante.
These are actually pretty much.	Haec vere satis multa sunt.
Yes, it is.	Etiam, est.
I am not good.	Non sum bonus.
It is important.	Aliquam sit amet.
if he can.	si possit.
How easy, how easy it was.	Quam facile, quam facile, factum est.
We're there tonight.	Hac nocte ibi sumus.
Not long well.	Non diu bene.
It's not that hard.	Non quod difficile.
I know and like my father.	Scio et sicut pater.
I want to hear like one in the morning.	Sicut unum mane audire volo.
we can get something else.	aliquid aliud possumus accipere.
Which makes it so difficult.	Quod tam difficile facit.
I thought something was going to happen.	Putavi fore aliquid futurum.
Maybe you were right.	Forte recte.
But that's out of it.	Sed id ex enim.
But if you can do it all.	Sed si id potes omnia.
And whatever you like.	Et quod placet.
How could this be done?	Quomodo hoc fieri potuit?
That is, I	Id est, ego.
Maybe but only time.	Aliquam sed tempus nisi.
I don't want to talk.	Nolo loqui.
He knew that he didn't want to.	Sciebat se noluisse.
But not often.	Sed non saepe.
Have a day too.	Habere diem quoque.
Not well.	Non bene.
Not by everybody.	Non ab omnibus.
He probably should.	Probabiliter debet.
The car was still alive.	Currus adhuc erat.
Let me tell you something.	Dicam tibi aliquid.
But today is easy.	Sed hodie facile est.
And it is good.	Et bonum est.
It will be fine.	Bene erit.
So there you have it.	Sic ibi habes.
Is it not .	Estne .
You can talk.	Potes loqui.
He wanted everything for me.	Omnia mihi voluit.
For the guy not good.	Pro guy, non est bonum.
But better late than never.	Sed melius sero quam numquam.
I don't know what's wrong.	Nescio quid mali.
Yes, but always there.	Etiam sed semper enim.
He understood.	Intellexit.
who can do this for me?	quis me hoc facere potest?
But neither was it now.	Sed nec erat nunc.
I don't want to play again today.	Nolo hodie iterum ludere.
I feel like he's still alive.	Sentio ut hic adhuc est.
Something has happened to me.	Habet aliquid ad me factum.
Well you're getting together.	Bene fecisti questus simul.
I don't do anything for you.	Non aliquid tibi.
You just stay with us.	Tu modo nobiscum mane.
Well that's entirely true.	Bene id omnino verum est.
You'd like to go south.	Meridiem ire velis.
He probably bought it himself.	Probabiliter hoc ipsum non emit.
He could not.	Non potuit.
It's hard to deal with this dog right now.	Difficile canem de hoc nunc.
Don't say it! 	Noli dicere!
.	.
I didn't know what else to say.	Aliud nesciebam dicere.
He thinks that's fun too.	Cogitat amet id quoque.
i never knew it could be so good.	numquam scivi posse esse tam bonum.
But now there is no button.	Nunc sed nulla ipsum.
Please don't do this.	Noli, quaeso, hoc facere.
That's what it's hard to do.	Id quod difficile est facere.
You did it.	Fecisti.
But he does this one thing.	Sed hoc unum facit.
It is also great.	Etiam magna.
It is very well done.	Optime factum est.
Yes you are right.	Ita recte.
But not for him.	Sed nec enim ipsum.
Maybe she doesn't know.	Fortasse nescit.
I have no doubt about this.	de hoc non dubito.
Maybe he forgot it.	Fortasse oblitus est.
Not so here.	Non ita hic.
I made my decision.	Meum consilium feci.
He looked good.	Vidit bonum.
Well not always.	Bene non semper.
This is about you.	Haec de te.
This is possible.	Hoc fieri potest.
What he did was enough.	Satis erat quod fecit.
And now that seems like a good plan.	Et nunc, ut bonum consilium videtur.
How do I do it.	Quomodo id faciam.
I don't know what happened here.	Nescio quid hic factum est.
But the work was not enough.	Sed opus non erat satis.
This you had to do.	Hoc tibi erat faciendum.
I am not surprised.	Non miror.
You can get dates here.	Accipere potes hic dies.
Someone has to be pretty good.	Habet esse aliquem satis bene.
He could not leave him.	Eum relinquere non potuit.
and you can see.	et videre potes.
He did not see them coming, just in that day.	Non vidit venire, modo in illa.
I thought, perhaps .	Cogitavi, fortasse .
He was always, always.	Semper erat semper.
First of all, don't look.	Ante omnia ne vide.
You can't do it for me.	Me facere non potes.
It is now .	Nunc est .
It was very nice to me.	Mihi admodum fuit.
It was his.	Eius erat.
I don't know it.	Nescio eam.
You don't need to talk.	Loqui non opus est.
Now I'm happy.	Nunc gaudeo.
It certainly does.	Habet certe.
Never been there.	Numquam ibi.
but he is the only child.	sed solus puer est.
I did not want to know anything.	nihil scire nolui.
He likes to go.	Velit ut.
Yes, so badly.	Sic, sic male.
It was too easy.	Nimium erat facile.
Staying is not good.	Manere non est bonum.
He seems unable to speak.	Loqui posse videtur.
He was well.	Bene erat.
After all these things.	Post haec omnia.
It never is.	Numquam est.
Maybe it'll be okay.	Forsitan bene erit.
Whether someone is there.	Utrum aliquis ibi.
It's not OK.	Bene non est.
I thought.	Cogitavi.
I am the one who is sorry to say that.	Sum ille qui me paenitet dicere.
I have some question.	Habeo aliquam quaestionem.
I do not think.	non puto.
But neither was he.	Sed nec erat.
You'd never do that.	Numquam facere velis.
You are not thinking.	Non cogitas.
I wish I had something to do with it!	Utinam aliquid ad rem?
But no one is the same.	Sed quis ipsum nulla.
He was just a boy.	Puer iustus erat.
That's what we're doing.	Id quod nos facere.
So win everything.	Ita omnia vincere.
We still have some time.	Adhuc aliquid temporis habemus.
He is also a good father.	Pater quoque bonus est.
You can do nothing.	Nihil potes.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
This was what he wanted.	Hoc erat quod voluit.
And he told me everything.	Et dixit mihi omnia.
Well you know how it is.	Bene scis quomodo sit.
It was not enough.	Parum fuit.
But I don't want to give too much.	Nolo tamen nimium dare.
He speaks, and it is so.	Loquitur, et est ita.
But it is already done.	Sed iam factum est.
No, as it seems to me.	Nemo, ut mihi videtur.
Everything he knew was the first time.	Omnia sciebat, primum erat.
But tonight he doesn't.	Sed hac nocte non facit.
He thought he would do it.	Putabat se facturum.
That is right.	Id est, recte.
But that's how.	Sed id quam.
To no more than no.	Ut non quam nulla.
It seems not so well.	Videtur non bene.
No it is not for us.	Nulla non est nobis.
This was evil.	Hoc malum fuit.
Which in itself is enough.	Quod in se satis est.
To know each other.	Scire se.
I hope all is well.	Spero bene.
I was always good.	semper bene fui.
So you made us all.	Sic nos fecisti omnes.
Yes, that's always it.	Etiam id semper enim.
Nothing is gonna be great.	Nulla sit amet magna.
I would like to tell you	Dicere tibi vellem .
It will be the same for you.	Idem tibi erit.
Not much.	Non multum.
May this help someone in the future.	Utinam hoc aliquem in futurum adiuvet.
My father too.	Pater meus etiam.
If nothing is better.	Si nihil est melius.
Usually an.	Fere an.
Can't understand.	Non potest intelligere.
There's some fun in that.	In sit amet aliquam quam.
I am not good.	Non sum bonus.
I can hardly hear.	vix possum audire.
I just don't like you anymore.	Modo non amo te amplius.
Maybe it's time.	Aliquam id tempus est.
I just want to be alone.	Ego iustus volo solus esse.
That was the same thing.	Id ipsum erat.
I don't know what he means.	Nescio quidem quid sibi velit.
This was a little while ago.	Hoc paulo ante fuit.
We can do it for you and me.	Possumus id fieri, me et te.
That's what it is.	Ut id est enim.
But not.	Sed non.
If we	Si nos .
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
But we can live badly.	Sed male vivere possumus.
never asked.	Nunquam quaesivit.
He seemed unable to think.	Videbatur cogitare non posse.
As it seems.	Ut videtur.
No, okay.	Non, bene.
I believe there will not be.	Credo ibi non esse.
So happy to live.	Sic felix vivere.
This only	Hoc solum .
It is probable what will happen.	Probabile est quid futurum sit.
And he did it again.	Et fecit iterum.
I don't want to come back again.	Nolo iterum illuc venire.
Now he was in no mood.	Nunc in nulla erat.
I think it is.	esse puto.
That's almost nothing.	Id est fere nihil.
But otherwise.	Aliud, sed.
I will say that it was great.	Dicam quod erat magna.
It really wasn't a problem.	Is vere quaestio non fuit.
and what he perhaps knew.	et quod forte sciebat.
You're not really here.	Non vere hic es.
To-morrow is to-morrow.	Cras in cras est.
Even if .	Etiam si .
Thus the day could not.	Sic dies potuit.
To get some out of it.	Ut id aliquam ex.
No but great.	Nulla sed magna.
I don't know why now.	Nescio cur modo.
Yes this has been said before.	Etiam id dictum ante.
He did not do this well.	Hoc bene non fecit.
And you said it yourself.	Et tu ipse dixisti.
If you can't let me know.	Si non potest me scire.
I am afraid, indeed.	Vereor, vere.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
Take a look! 	Vide!
He would not, but could not.	Noluit, sed potuit.
I don't mean to be.	Non vult esse.
He's with me.	Hic mecum est.
What is it yet? 	Quid est tamen?
By this before.	Per id ante.
I could be a teacher.	Potui magister.
Never, please.	Numquam, velit.
He could not think any longer.	Non amplius se cogitare posse.
Too bad we can't do it all.	Nimis malum facere non possumus omnes.
I thought well what I got.	Cogitavi etiam quod obtinuit.
I hope it never does.	Spero quod nunquam facit.
I don't know what it is about him.	Quid de eo sit nescio.
She didn't talk to me anymore.	Mihi amplius loqui non illa.
It's time to do it.	Aliquam faciam.
I'm afraid of you.	Vereor quod de te.
Who do you want.	Qui vis.
I don't want to be at this house.	Nolo esse apud hanc domum.
Both would be the same.	Utrumque idem fore.
What we are here is good.	Quod hic sumus, bonum est.
he was, there he was.	hic erat, ibi erat.
He means a lot to me.	Ipse mihi multum est.
I think this is not yours.	Hoc puto non esse tuum.
It's time to ask.	Aliquam a erat.
He was not easily forgotten.	Non erat homo facile oblitus.
It's kind of me.	Sic est genus meum.
but you know.	sed scis.
Yes they are here.	Ita sunt hic.
You get more money.	Plus tibi pecuniam.
Well you're really hard right now.	Bene rem iam difficile es.
but all in their season.	sed omnia in tempore suo.
And we can do better.	Et melius possumus facere.
None of this has been said.	Nulla id dictum est.
Maybe that was some.	Aliquam id aliquam erat.
i hope to be.	spero esse.
But I don't play.	Sed non ludere.
He thinks he knows.	Scire putat.
He told me to stay with him.	Dixit me manere cum eo.
that is the thing.	id est rem.
This is where the evil started.	Hic ubi incepit malum.
I'll tell him and that's him.	Dicam ei et id ipsum.
That's a big question.	Id magna quaestio est.
He does not do everything.	Non omnia facit.
I could say nothing.	nihil dicere potui.
This is now.	Hoc nunc est.
And well too.	Et bene quoque.
I just wanted to hear you say it again.	Modo audire volui te dicere iterum.
Maybe he'll be there all day and maybe longer.	Forsitan ibi erit totum diem et fortasse diutius.
I have seen this happen.	Vidi hoc fieri.
Even what no one wants.	Etiam quis nulla velit.
None of the above.	Nulla in dictum ex.
I just don't know what to do next.	Modo nescio quid faciendum.
The thing is from him.	Res ab eo est.
But before him.	Sed id ipsum ante.
And we're okay with it.	Et bene sumus ex eo.
There are a lot of bad things.	Multum mali sunt.
Look at what's happened.	Vide quid acciderit.
As used to be with everyone.	Sicut fieri solebat cum omnibus.
It was the same thing.	Erat idem.
what i will do.	quod ego facturus sum.
I don't want you in it.	Nolo te in eo.
They are all one.	Omnes unum sunt.
We like going home.	Domum placet nobis.
She's always been happy.	Illa semper felix fuit.
It was not like this to him.	Hoc ei non erat simile.
Nothing is all at once.	Nihil simul est omnia.
I don't know how to do this.	Nescio quomodo hoc faciam.
Yes probably not.	Ita verisimile non est.
It's time to be honest with you.	Aliquam et ex sit amet enim.
I will not do it this time.	Non faciam hoc tempore.
I know that it is.	id esse scio.
I just want to help.	EGO iustus volo adiuvare.
There was nothing but a dog.	Non erat nihil nisi canis.
Don't you ever do it to me.	Ne tu id mihi umquam facias.
not well.	non bene.
That's not for him.	Ut non enim ipsum.
I just want you to stay.	Modo volo te manere.
Probably of all.	Verisimiliter de omnibus.
It has no future.	Futurum non habet.
I don't have money.	Pecuniam non habeo.
He is ready.	Paratus est.
He knew that.	Sciebat.
But who was great?	Sed quis magna erat.
He doesn't want to find out.	Non vult invenire.
You need to know that you can be good enough.	Scire debes quod satis esse potes.
.	.
I would not do so.	Nolui sic facere.
We can't do enough.	Satis facere non possumus.
But to you too.	Sed ad te quoque.
No one can do this.	Hoc nemo agere potest.
The question is, he knows how.	Quaestio est, nescit quomodo.
I want you to come home.	Volo te domum venire.
I don't know how to get there.	Nescio quomodo huc illuc.
But that from which he can.	Sed id ex quo potest.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
We don't need anything to do.	Non opus est nobis aliquid facere.
I can't think of anything to do.	Non possum cogitare aliquid facere.
home	in domum suam.
I feel really good about that.	Vere bonum quod sentio.
Even more than any other thing.	Etiam quam aliquam rem.
But now nothing is the same.	Sed nunc nihil ipsum.
This is going to work.	Hoc futurum opus est.
There is no order.	Nulla ut.
I told him.	Dixi ei.
It is not necessary to be like this.	Non necesse est sic esse.
I could do this.	Hoc potui.
I love him so much already.	Iam eum tantum amo.
But it is well.	Sed bene est.
She just went home.	Illa iustus abiit in domum suam.
But neither was he himself.	Sed nec ipsum erat.
But not always the same.	Sed non semper ipsum.
But that does not seem to come.	Sed id venire non videtur.
No one knew this.	Nemo id scivit.
No that's none other than that.	Nulla id nulla quam.
But yes, that's very important.	Etiam sed ipsum quam.
probably	probabiliter.
He did exactly as he said.	Fecit prorsus ut dixit.
he did his job.	officium suum fecit.
I guess that's the only advice I can make.	Suspicor consilium quod modo facere potest.
Certainly not even he knew it.	Ne certe quidem sciebat.
He always eats all these things.	Haec omnia semper comedit.
We can all do better.	Melius possumus omnes facere.
This work has already started.	Opus hoc iam incepit.
You can't give what you don't have.	Quod non habes, dare non potes.
I'm not sorry.	Non me paenitet.
It would be great for my mom, but not at all.	Multum esset meum, sed non omnino.
For so it was done.	Sic enim factum est.
Now see what's happened.	Nunc vide quid acciderit.
He comes to you.	Venit ad vos.
He was and is who.	Erat et est quis.
You mean it was with me tonight.	Mecum erat vis hac nocte.
Which one did he	Quod unum fecit.
Yes that's how it was.	Etiam id quam erat.
It is certain.	Certum est.
But it was no longer my job.	Sed iam non erat officium meum.
That's not true.	Ut 'non est verum.
This is his dog.	Hic canis eius.
He was never from him.	Numquam ab illo non erat.
Nothing was easier anymore.	Nihil erat facile amplius.
Someone who knows her really well, that is.	Aliquis qui eam vere bene novit, hoc est.
time to do it.	tempus faciam.
Today is not a day.	Hodie non est dies.
No that is none.	Nulla ut est nulla.
I don't want to believe.	Non vis credere.
I've been there.	Fui ibi.
Or perhaps he didn't say it at all.	Vel fortasse omnino non dixisse.
To speak also means to hear oneself speak.	Loqui etiam est audire se loqui.
he could not yet see.	nondum videre potuit.
But it is true.	Sed verum est.
It is a complete affair.	Omnino res est.
There's no great thing in it.	Nulla in magna ipsum.
I'm glad.	Gaudeo.
I know not to be.	Scio non esse.
It is not easy to hear this.	Non facile est hoc audire.
It's too much to do.	Nimium est id facere.
This season was much better.	Multo melius hoc tempus erat.
Well, good to you.	Bene, bonum tibi.
I don't need anything else.	Non opus est mihi aliud.
Hardly should it be.	Vix esse debet.
and often does.	et saepe agit.
You know it's not okay.	Scis suus non bene.
Maybe, I don't know, got it.	Fortasse, nescio, obtinuit.
There's nothing in it other than that.	In id nulla quam.
It ought to be.	Esse debet.
Tell me just what you want.	Dic modo quid velis.
Please do this.	Quaeso hoc fac.
It is true.	Verum est .
I don't know you like this.	Non sic te novi.
There is so much to think about.	Cogitare tantum est.
Make one.	Fac unum.
Or his.	Vel eius .
I don't exactly know why.	Non prorsus cur.
This is not all about me.	Hoc non est totum de me.
He was here.	Hic fuit.
My night.	Mea nocte.
She wants you to know.	Illa te scire vult.
But not even that.	Sed non id quidem.
So it is and here.	Sic est et hic.
I will tell you what really happened.	Quod vere factum sit dicam.
Which is not good.	Quae non.
I can't speak.	Non possum dicere.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum est.
None of it was great.	Nulla a erat magna.
I have already said.	Jam dixi.
He wanted nothing there.	Nihil ibi voluit.
You have us both now.	Habes nos ambo nunc.
I do not know what.	Nescio quid.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id erat ipsum.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
The father said to us.	Pater nobis dixit.
This man did so.	Hic ita fecit.
not you.	Non te.
Now that's all he wants.	Nunc ut velit est.
If he wanted, he could.	Si vellet, posset.
Why? 	Quare?
I couldn't quite answer the question.	Non potui satis quaestionem.
It's different than with you.	Est aliud quam apud te.
I know this is not easy for you.	Hoc scio tibi non facile.
It was great.	In magna erat.
That is difficult.	Id difficile est.
I don't quite know what to say about him.	Non satis scio quid de illo dicam.
Still so early.	Adhuc tam mane.
I have to give you.	Habeo tibi dare.
Do it if possible.	Fac si fieri potest.
But this one is not for me.	Sed hoc unum non est mihi.
That she did.	Id fecit.
That is not necessary.	Quod non est necesse.
What is true with you is not true at all.	Quod apud te verum est, non est verum apud omnes.
Here we have one	Hic habemus unum .
So i'm really sorry about this.	Ita sum de hoc vere paenitet.
I really love this guy.	Ego vere amo guy.
You're not there anymore.	Non es amplius.
This was not true.	Hoc non fuit.
You know, like a dog.	Scis, ut canis.
We'll be fine.	Bene nobis erit.
However, it does not and never will.	Tamen non et numquam vult.
There is nothing else to say.	Dicere nihil est aliud.
Now only one.	Nunc tantum una.
He wasn't sure who it was.	Certus erat quis esset.
But it was time.	Sed tempus erat.
And rightly so.	Et recte.
I never thought it would happen.	Numquam putavi fore.
Not after what he did.	Non post id quod fecit.
i wanted out.	de volui.
But also another.	Sed et aliud.
You know you're doing enough.	Scis te satis facere.
But it is not seen.	Sed non videtur.
But nothing of it.	Sed nihil ex eo.
That's because it's his.	Ut pro eo quod suum est.
As never before.	Ut numquam ante, quam.
But it was from him.	Sed a erat ipsum.
Not a whole lot of job.	Non multum totum officium.
But to deal with him.	Sed agere cum eo.
But perhaps before.	Sed fortasse ante.
It was behind me.	Post me fuit.
After him	Post eum .
You can see this happening.	Hoc fieri videre potes.
Maybe it wasn't true after all.	Fortasse non fuit verum post omnes.
The man is not yet at home.	Nondum vir domi est.
Maybe it's not always.	Aliquam non semper est.
And he has something to say.	Et habet aliquid dicere.
He did not think that he would be.	Non putabat se fore.
Just don't be honest.	Iustus non sit amet.
Now i'm so good.	Nunc ego sum tam bona.
To me for sure.	Ad me certe.
He was not happy.	Felix non fuit.
That's not always the case.	Id non semper.
I'm trying to do this.	Hoc me facere conatur.
I would never want to see you.	Nunquam te videre volo.
There is no word in it.	Nulla in dictum enim.
There's always tomorrow.	Cras in semper nulla.
See all with him.	Vide omnes cum eo.
I am so glad to see him.	Tam gaudeo illum videre.
Maybe this has nothing to do with it.	Fortasse hoc nihil ad rem.
And, as it seems, he thinks that there is nothing wrong.	Et, ut videtur, nihil mali esse putat.
This is as good as you are.	Tam bene hic habet quam tu.
Well you don't have to say that.	Bene tibi non est dicere.
Now I know this.	Nunc id scio.
He will not be one, nor will there ever be one.	Non unus, nec unus semper erit.
I wonder what this is.	Miror quid hoc sit.
Even so, it was too much time to think.	Etiam ita tempus erat nimis cogitare.
But that said nothing.	Sed id dictum nulla.
All this has begun.	Hoc totum incepit.
It is in us.	In nobis est.
But that's no order yet.	Sed id nulla ut adhuc.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
I spoke to him this morning.	Hoc ei mane dixi.
It is not a matter of money.	Non est res pecuniae.
I have never done this.	numquam hoc feci.
The boy would be soon.	Puer mox fore.
See how to do it.	Vide quomodo facere.
The work is hard.	Opus est, difficile.
Yes, that's what he wants.	Etiam id velit quam.
You are not a man.	Non homo.
It's done for me before.	Mihi ante factum est.
But there was not any.	Sed non aliquam erat.
It has what you need.	Habet quod debes.
He said quickly.	Cito dixit.
It is working well now.	Nunc bene sit opus.
This is no longer there.	Hoc iam non est.
It's something we can help today.	Est aliquid hodie adiuvare possumus.
I hope this will help.	Spero hoc auxilium.
I wonder what he wants.	Miror quid velit.
But he knew that all things were by himself.	Sciebat autem omnia per se esse.
Something he does.	Aliquid agit.
Not too soon.	Nec cito.
It can be done quickly.	Cito fieri potest.
I know what you love for dinner.	Scio quid amat prandium.
This incident occurred shortly.	Quae res parum occurrit.
That was it.	Id erat.
It's already tonight.	Iam hac nocte est.
But I do not speak.	Sed non loqui.
Do not speak of yourself.	Noli ex te loqui.
Maybe not great but	Aliquam non magna nisi.
Just say your name.	Modo dic nomen tuum.
and you are mine.	et meus es.
He said that he was.	Dixit se esse.
There is no such thing as none.	Nulla ut nulla ipsum.
Better in it.	Melius in eam.
And now why.	Et nunc cur.
I think he is right now.	Puto eum nunc esse.
Or my dog.	Vel canem meum.
I want to know everything about him.	Scire volo omnia de eo.
He knew him for years.	Annos sciebat eum.
This one was good.	Hoc unum bonum fuit.
I didn't tell you.	Non dixi tibi.
But not only.	Sed non solum.
I'm here to do it.	Hic ego faciam.
To trust someone.	Credere aliquem.
He could not say why, but it was.	Non potuit dicere quare, sed fuit.
I am surprised at one thing.	Miror unum.
It was too late.	Sero hoc fuit.
I'm sorry.	Paenitet me.
I want myself to do it.	Ego me id facere volo .
I couldn't post that night.	Nocte post non potui.
I don't like many things.	Non ut multa.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
This is a bad decision.	Malum hoc consilium est.
If you want, look for yourself.	Si vis, vide tibi.
He was unable to do this.	Hoc facere non erat.
It was what it was.	Erat quod erat.
This makes you want to go there.	Hoc facit vis ire illuc.
The deal is pretty good.	Et multum est satis bonum.
I haven't always done it.	Non semper feci.
I can't see you in.	Non possum videre in.
It's easy enough to tell you.	Satis facile est tibi dicere.
In the game.	In velit.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
Too much in the morning.	Multo etiam mane.
But that is none.	Sed ut nulla est.
Not much.	Non multum.
Who, why, how.	Quis, quare, quomodo.
one day was one day.	unus dies erat unus dies.
For both you have to think.	Utrumque enim habes cogitare.
I want to be happy with this.	Ad hoc felix volo.
It's already enough, though.	Jam satis est, sed.
You did your work yesterday.	Opus tuum heri fecisti.
I can't do it again.	Iterum facere non possum.
Is it me? 	Estne mihi?
I can't go on like this.	Non possum sic ire.
We're sorry.	Nos paenitet nos.
Tell her to come here.	Dic ei huc venire.
But that's no time.	Sed id tempus nulla.
If there is.	Si est.
Not just to do it.	Non solum id facere.
This one is.	Hic unus est.
To-morrow it's the same thing.	Cras id ipsum ex.
I thought you'd like this.	Putavi hoc velis.
The morning was busy.	Mane erat occupatus.
Yes that's always before.	Etiam id semper ante.
There's nothing to see.	Nihil est ibi videre.
He says to give me his money.	Ille mihi pecuniam suam dare dicit.
He is not even a good enough man.	Is ne homo quidem satis bonus est.
This was what I needed to think about.	Hoc erat quod opus erat cogitare.
haven't got it yet.	Non tamen obtinuit.
He refused to say why.	Noluit dicere quare.
I don't know whether it is true.	Nescio, an verum sit.
My father did it.	Pater meus fecit.
You're probably right, though.	Verisimile recte es, sed.
You can see it now.	Nunc eam videre potes.
It still looked good.	Adhuc bene videbatur.
I'm not sure either.	Non sum certus vel.
Why are you even here?	Cur etiam hic es?.
Neither do you.	Nec tu.
Good to you for this.	Bene tibi pro hoc.
There is no ex from her.	Nulla a ex eius.
You can leave us.	Potes nos relinquere.
They are completely different.	Aliud omnino sunt.
Or misunderstood.	Vel male intellexit.
Which of the following.	Qui ex.
Both are true.	Utrumque verum est.
There is so much to see and do.	Est tantum videre et facere.
He comes to me.	Venit ad me.
We both thought the same thing.	Ambo idem putabam.
he had a plan.	consilium habuit.
And it is that.	Et est id.
I don't like to think but do.	Non amo nos cogitare, sed facere.
This apple is going badly.	Hoc malum eat male.
I would like him.	Eum vellem.
There was no way to get some.	Nulla ut aliquam erat.
But that is.	Sed id est est.
if you please.	si placet.
It is not so.	Non est ita.
I hope to see you again!.	Spero te videre iterum !.
Yes, that was not good.	Etiam non erat quam.
And he did a good work on that day.	Et fecit opus bonum in die illo.
Get a job done.	Ut a officium est.
Appreciate your help!	Bene tuum auxilium!.
There is something there.	Aliquid ibi est.
I don't mean anything else.	Non vult aliud.
It's time for any one of them.	Aliquam quis ex enim.
You did not say.	Non dixisti.
Maybe it wasn't but it was.	Aliquam non nisi erat.
Maybe that was how.	Aliquam id erat quam.
That's what it was now.	Ut id erat nunc.
Now that's him out.	Nunc id ipsum ex.
But he cannot do it.	Sed facere non potest.
He likes to talk.	Loqui vult.
not often enough.	Non satis saepe.
That	Quod .
That's not him.	Ut non est ipsum.
He doesn't love the guy.	Non amat guy.
I would appreciate help.	Bene auxilium vellem.
It was not so.	Non ita erat.
I can't do this.	Non possum hoc fieri.
That's not to say no.	Ut non dictum nulla.
Well, maybe you too.	Bene, fortasse tu quoque.
You know, finally.	Scis tandem.
Maybe you can't talk.	Fortasse loqui non potes.
One thing is for sure.	Una res est pro certo.
That's what.	Id quod.
Without you nothing else.	Sine te nihil aliud.
He did not wish.	Nec velit.
Only boy and father.	Puer tantum et pater.
But there was also time.	Sed et tempus erat.
The story was before, not said before.	Aliquam in erat ante, non dictum ante.
It is good.	Bene est.
That is very good.	Quod valde bonum est.
We never plan.	Consilium habemus numquam.
We can't believe him.	Non possumus ei credere.
I love you, but you are not mine.	Amo te, sed non es meus.
This was not good.	Hoc non erat bonum.
Not even now.	Non nunc quidem.
I wonder who it is.	Miror quis sit.
He was going to do that.	Quod esset facturum.
He didn't want to talk about it.	Noluit de hoc loqui.
He was already three.	Erat, iam paulo ante tres.
I could hardly think.	Vix cogitare potui.
Why didn't he come home yesterday.	Cur heri domum non venit.
I'll tell you tonight.	Dicam tibi hac nocte.
Well said to me.	Bene mihi dixit.
But not from.	Sed non ex.
Unless he did.	Nisi fecerit.
He said that he was a teacher.	Dixit magister se esse.
It's not your job.	Non est officium tuum.
And better in almost everything.	Et melius in omnibus fere.
There is no need.	Opus non est.
All indeed.	Omnes quidem.
I don't want to say.	Nolo dicere.
You can talk to me tomorrow.	Cras mihi dicere potes.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
Now I want it.	Nunc volo.
But he also seemed to be able to play.	Sed etiam ludere posse videbatur.
It's his.	Eius est.
It has everything.	Res habet omnia.
It's just each day.	Suus 'iustus per dies.
It is important to ex.	Aliquam sit amet ex ex.
There are not a lot of things out there.	Sunt ibi non multum.
So nothing to do with it.	Ita nihil ad rem.
No one comes to us.	Nemo ad nos venit.
I will always do it.	Semper faciam.
And he was there.	Erat autem ibi.
But it seems a lot.	Multum tamen videtur.
A lot!.	Sit amet!.
The day is always.	Dies est semper.
If it is the same, it is one.	Si idem est, unum est.
This has happened a lot.	Hoc factum est multum.
You can only do what you can.	Hoc solum facere potes quod potes.
And he knew well.	Et bene scivit.
Not a day anymore.	Non dies amplius.
He wanted to say something, but nothing came.	Aliquid dicere voluit, sed nihil venit.
Maybe it was yesterday.	Fortasse heri fuit.
Not exactly one.	Non una prorsus.
But not as much as he could.	Sed non quantum potuit.
No one talks to you.	Nulla tecum loquitur.
I just don't know how to make it.	Im iustus nescio quomodo ad eam.
There was something more.	Plus aliquid fuit.
It is a great thing.	Res magna est.
That's pretty much done.	Id satis factum.
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla nisi.
It would seem that all things and all things.	Videtur quod omnia et omnia.
I don't know how we're here.	Nescio quomodo hic sumus.
This is good.	Is bonus est.
It was okay with me.	Mecum bene fuit.
I am not already.	Jam non sum.
Will do again this week.	Iterum hac septimana facturus erit.
But before that same thing.	Sed ante id ipsum.
Tomorrow is and is.	Cras et est est.
This is a great question.	Magna quaestio haec est.
He loves him very much.	Valde amat eum.
But it was time.	Sed tempus erat.
I would not go there.	Ibi ire nolui.
He thought it was time.	Putabat esse temporis.
But that's now.	Sed id nunc.
I want help.	Auxilium volo.
He tried to say it alone.	Ille id solum dicere conatus est.
We are also here.	Etiam hic sumus.
We will always be.	Semper nos.
Well done.	Bene fecit.
I can't do anything with it.	Non possum facere quicquam cum illa.
You don't need anything from me.	Non opus est tibi a me quicquam.
her father again.	Pater eius iterum.
But there was no time.	Sed nec tempus erat.
But he did not want this to be done.	Noluit autem hoc fieri.
Yes it is true.	Etiam verum est.
I don't like you.	Non ut tibi.
As much as you can.	Quantum potes.
But there is more to this.	Sed plus ad hoc.
He knew he could not stay.	Scivit se non posse manere.
Look at it!	Illud vide!.
It was like the first time.	Simile primum fuit.
And this is very good to know.	Et hoc est ipsum bonum scire.
I want to go.	Ire volo.
Well it's the same thing.	Bene idem est.
No one can know for sure.	Pro certo nemo scire potest.
I like this.	Hoc ego amo.
Maybe that's what he does.	Forsitan id quod agit.
Yes this has been said before.	Etiam id dictum ante.
Maybe it was good for him.	Forsitan ei bonum fuit.
I love you and always have.	Ego te amo, et semper habeo.
I was just a boy.	Puer tantum fui.
He didn't know better.	Nesciebat melius.
You never know who.	Numquam quis.
Look what I've seen before.	Ego vidi quod vide ante.
But you can do nothing really.	Sed nihil vere potes.
I really don't know right now.	Ego vere iam nescio.
I hope you all like it.	Spero te omnes placet.
It's time for him.	Aliquam pro ipsum est.
No one knew for certain, nor did he know it.	Nemo pro certo scivit nec nesciebat.
You could also appreciate.	Posset etiam tu bene.
It's a great thing for me.	Magna res mihi est.
There was no wish from him.	Nulla a velit erat.
But he was not able to do it.	Sed id facere non erat.
That is.	Quod est.
It's good to be home.	Bonum est esse domi.
There is also.	Est etiam.
Well, yes.	Bene, ita .
This is the first video that started it all.	Hic primum video quod incepit omnia.
This only pleases me very much.	Hoc solum mihi valde placet.
It was time for some fun.	Aliquam sit amet tempus erat.
But there is another thing too.	Sed aliud quoque.
But we can do something about this.	Sed de hoc aliquid possumus.
We could be again.	Posset nos iterum esse.
for sure he had.	pro certo habuit.
It is well and well.	Bene et bene est.
That's exactly what you want.	Id ipsum quid vis.
I was aware of this.	Scire me per id erat.
Why are we here.	Cur hic sumus.
You are making a lot more money.	Multum plus pecuniae facis.
He looks at him.	Spectat eum.
I think it's okay.	Puto bene.
He was no longer a man.	Homo iam non erat.
Yet no one can see this.	Hoc tamen nemo potest videre.
It's not really easy for you.	Hoc vere facile tibi non est.
He said I'm sorry.	Dixit me se paenitet.
No one can do it.	Nemo id facere potest.
Who in one place.	Qui in unum.
Nothing more than what you want to give.	Nihil amplius quam quod vis dare.
I want this.	Hanc volo.
But one thing was certain.	Sed unum certum erat.
There is no one for him.	Nulla quis ipsum enim.
Even in the past.	Etiam in erat ante.
Truly, truly.	Vere, vere.
This is also difficult.	Hoc quoque difficile est.
If he has, he thought.	Si habet, putabat.
Maybe it's true.	Fortasse verum est.
It was really bad.	Malum erat vere.
He doesn't want to do it.	Non vult facere.
It ought to be his first.	Primum suum esse debet.
i can do whatever i like.	facere possum quod mihi placet.
It was not what it seemed to be.	Non erat quod videbatur esse.
Nothing new.	Nihil novi.
I know what you mean.	Scio quid velis.
That is not true.	Quod non est.
Better in everything.	Melius in omnibus.
This is what he did.	Hoc ipsum est quod fecit.
It's something.	Est aliquid.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
It is for us.	Est nobis.
Nothing for the purpose except.	Nihil ad rem nisi.
It is so bad that it is so bad.	Tam malum est ut malum.
It seemed to me only now.	Videbatur nunc me solum.
Good job too.	Bene etiam officium.
To me all is well.	Mihi omnia bene sunt.
At length he got it.	Tandem obtinuit.
You want to know, now you know.	Scire vis, nunc scis.
But that night he did not come to her.	Illa autem nocte non venit ad eam.
i never really know.	numquam vere scio.
But we are not.	Sed non sumus.
He did so in his own time.	Sic suo tempore fecit.
That was something.	Quod erat aliquid.
But it has been a long time.	Sed diu fuit.
It was certain that she was.	Certum erat eam esse.
You don't need me home.	Non opus est mecum domum.
That's also true.	Id verum etiam.
Looks like something.	Similis res.
For he was.	Erat enim.
late in the afternoon again.	Sero post meridiem iterum.
But that's how it was said.	Sed id dictum quam.
But he thought it.	Sed putabat id.
Or how to get it.	Vel id quam ut.
Time before.	Tempus ante.
But there was a lot of time.	Sed sit amet tempus erat.
he loves you so much.	tantum te amat.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
He didn't think he ought to.	Non putabat debere.
Something is behind.	Aliquid post est.
Nothing to do.	Nihil facere.
Maybe none.	Aliquam nulla.
That is good.	Bonum est, quod est.
This is the same in this too.	Hoc idem in hac quoque.
You just had to know where to look.	Vos iustus erat scire ubi vide.
No, it must needs be willing of its own.	Non, necesse habet esse de suo velle.
This post is up to you.	Post hoc ad vos est.
But there is only time.	Sed non tempus nisi.
It's not bad.	Non est malum.
It seemed certain.	Certo videbatur.
By this way	Per hoc iter.
And it is like good.	Et est simile bonum.
I hope to get one.	Spero fore ut unum.
To sit.	Ut sit.
Where are they now?	Ubi nunc sunt?.
I knew I could do this.	Hoc me facere posse sciebam.
This is difficult.	Difficile est hoc.
This is my job.	Hoc est officium meum.
Just like he.	Sicut ille.
But all things are yours before you.	Sed tua sunt omnia ante te.
Do whatever you want.	Facere quod vis.
That's good and true.	Quod bonum et verum.
There is no word in it.	Nulla in dictum enim.
That's one thing.	Id unum.
i don't know anything about him.	nescio quid de eo.
Not bad, really.	Non male, vere.
Which is not so, as you know now.	Quod non ita est, ut nunc scis.
I don't even see it.	Ne id quidem video.
There before.	Ibi ante.
You are the job.	Tu es officium.
I am not going to be honest, she thought.	Sit amet non facturus, putavit.
I believe there is something to do.	Est aliquid facere credo.
I must do this.	Hoc mihi faciendum est.
You did not do this.	Hoc non fecisti.
But he was also himself.	Sed et ipsum erat.
Which one was	Quod unum esset.
He could not do it.	Non potuit id facere.
He says nothing.	Nihil dicit.
I know a lot.	multum scio.
Or as soon as possible.	Vel ut simul.
This is one of her strengths.	Haec est una vis eius.
How not until now.	Ut nec quam nunc.
No but for him.	Nulla sed ipsum enim.
There is nothing else.	Nihil est aliud.
Not from you, but through you.	Non ex te, sed per te.
It seemed very likely.	Verisimile videbatur.
Talk about it.	Loqui de illo.
You want to see.	Vis videre.
For the first time, it is not bad.	Primum enim, non malum.
So he came in the morning.	Ita mane venit.
He came with me.	Venit mecum.
He does great things, he does all things well.	Magna facit, omnia bene facit.
But never married.	Sed numquam uxorem.
This is the first time.	Hoc est primum.
But he gave nothing.	Sed nihil dedit.
It is good.	Bonum est.
Well, here we are.	Bene, hic sumus.
This is almost always.	Hoc fere est.
Even for yourself.	Etiam pro te ipsum.
It was kind of you to think about me.	Erat ex vobis cogitare de me.
It was not so.	Non ita factum est.
The boy is still happy.	Puer felix adhuc est.
I feel myself.	Ego ipse sentio.
Certainly nothing here.	Certe nihil hic.
It's not yours.	Non est tua.
he was in there.	erat in ibi.
It's a journey.	Iter suus est.
I probably don't think anyone is good enough.	Probabile non putat quis mihi satis bonus est.
That it is so.	Quod ita sit.
The name is there too.	Nomen ibi quoque.
Yes, always.	Etiam semper.
But as stated above.	Sed ut dictum est.
But not enough.	Sed non satis.
You're not a thing.	Non es aliquid.
I never thought so.	Numquam ita putavi.
It is good.	Bene est.
I don't know how it can be.	Nescio quomodo id esse possit.
You don't think through everything.	Per omnia non cogitas.
I just don't know so much.	Modo non tam.
That is possible, however.	Quod potest, tamen.
i think i could.	posse puto.
He said the same thing.	Idem illud dixit.
I just said the truth.	Modo verum dixit.
Maybe that's nothing.	Aliquam id nisi.
I don't know what to say.	Quid dicam nescio.
But I don't have time for that.	Sed non tempus quam.
He wanted more.	Plus voluit.
For a long time.	Multo tempore.
Now not.	Nunc non.
It's pretty easy to do the same.	Sed satis facile per simile.
It was enough, but still enough.	Satis tamen satis erat.
I've never really met him, you know.	Nunquam ei vere occurrit, tu scis.
But it was not enough.	Sed parum fuit.
He seemed to say nothing more.	Nihil amplius dicere videbatur.
Would be.	Facturum esse.
It's kind of like for us.	Genus nobis simile est.
If you're at home, stay at home.	Si domi es, domi mane.
It was good too.	Bonum quoque erat.
I want him to do something else.	Eum volo aliquid aliud.
And he likes him.	Velit eum et.
That makes us.	Quod nos facit.
yes not always for.	Etiam non semper enim.
This is my journey.	Hoc est iter.
I will say nothing about it.	Nihil dicam id.
Maybe it was time.	Aliquam id tempus erat.
I was not a good man.	Vir bonus non fui.
It looks bad.	Malum videtur.
There was always nothing in it.	Nulla in semper erat.
You'll never see him like that before.	Numquam illum vide ut ante.
Yes that was great.	Etiam id erat magna.
Let me tell you one thing.	Dicam unum.
This is both good and bad for you.	Hoc tibi et bonum est et malum.
Well, maybe he's not the only one looking.	Bene, fortasse solus ille non spectat.
I just knew what she needed.	Modo sciebat quid illa opus esset.
He came into the room.	Venit in cubiculum.
I don't see why.	Nihil video cur non.
I do not believe this to be so.	Hoc ita esse non credo.
Him.	Eum.
You have even more options.	Plus etiam bene habes.
There is still time to win.	Vincere adhuc est.
In this way, please.	Hoc modo, quaeso.
We are here.	Nos hic sumus.
I'm the new guy.	Ego novi guy.
He did nothing.	Nihil fecit.
But that is altogether true.	Sed id prorsus verum est.
Maybe he forgot it.	Fortasse oblitus est.
It used to be.	Non solebat.
I believe you know me.	Scis me credo.
to do something like this.	ut aliquid simile hoc facias.
Nothing you haven't seen yet.	Nihil adhuc tibi non videtur.
That's what you've done.	Id quod feceris.
This was the matter.	Res hic erat.
i love you all.	omnes te amo.
That which was made, was made.	Quod factum est, factum est.
This has not been done much.	Hoc non est multum factum.
I can't see him.	Eum videre non possum.
You are not right.	Non recte.
It's about her.	De suo est.
But who to go with.	Sed quis ut cum.
He asked about me.	Quaesivit de me.
He did so.	Ita fecit.
I didn't think through everything.	Per omnia non putavi.
It's still enough to win.	Adhuc vincere satis est.
And I said to him, Not me anymore.	Et dixi ei: Non me amplius.
I had it before.	Habui id ante.
but he knew.	sed scivit.
He knows what he wants.	Novit quo velit.
We don't have all day.	Non habemus totum diem.
He wanted as much as he did.	Voluit quantum fecit.
There is no one who is not himself.	Nulla quis ipsum nulla.
Do it, you said.	Facias, dixisti.
There was no need for this.	Hoc opus non erat.
I am ready for everything.	Paratus sum ad omnia.
It was the same story.	Aliquam id ipsum erat.
I don't think, but something more.	Non cogitare, sed plus aliquid.
Certainly here.	Hic certe.
I can't do anything.	Non possum hoc facere aliquid.
He wanted it to be done.	Voluit fieri.
Nor could he.	Nec potuit.
Maybe not some but	Aliquam non aliquam nisi.
This was just yesterday.	Hoc modo heri erat.
I would do the same with him.	Idem ego cum illo facerem.
Really great.	Vere magna.
It also seems that the good is true.	Videtur etiam bonum esse verum.
Get some or some from.	Aliquam vel aliquam ex.
We are what we are, and you are.	Nos sumus quod sumus, et vos sumus.
It is still looking good.	Adhuc bona est vultus.
That was it.	Id id erat.
What is, a.	Quid est, a.
Maybe not but great.	Aliquam non nisi magna.
What is yours?	Quid est tuum?.
No one speaks with him.	Nemo cum eo loquitur.
Which I've never seen before.	Quae numquam ante.
He loves us both.	Ambo nos amat.
It almost seemed not enough.	Non satis fere videbatur.
It's getting late.	Sero suus questus est.
She was a teacher.	Illa magister erat.
We have done it.	Nos id fecisse.
We are the same.	Idem sumus.
Before he truly saw all things for what he was.	Ante vere vidit omnia pro eo quod erat.
It is not hard to find.	Non est difficile invenire.
Not enough time alone.	Parum, solus tempus.
Now you are not out there.	Nunc non ex nulla.
Maybe it was too much before.	Aliquam erat nimis ante.
This is just as much as he himself told us.	Hoc tantum quantum ipse nobis dixit.
No but it's great.	Nulla sed magna est.
He did not know why.	Cur nesciebat.
I don't care, she thought.	Nolo, putavit.
Maybe he's coming too late or too early.	Forsitan sero venit vel, nimium mane.
He wanted the same thing.	Voluit idem.
You.	Sit tibi.
May there be no problem for you.	Sit nulla quaestio te.
Please pretty much love.	Satis amet velit.
To never ever.	Ut numquam semper.
I believe it.	eam credo.
You can't speak.	Non potes dicere.
But tonight he wanted nothing to do with him.	Sed hac nocte nihil facere cum eo voluit.
Even when you don't love yourself.	Etiam cum non ipsum.
Nothing like something.	Nihil simile quid.
This is how.	Haec quomodo.
He does not do this.	Hoc non facit.
That day will be for everyone.	Quod hodie erit in omnibus.
I know we are still alive.	Novi adhuc sumus.
During all this time	Per totum hoc tempus.
It cannot be fixed.	Certum esse non potest.
But it was something.	Esset aliquid, sed.
He can't do this.	Hoc facere non potest.
I didn't want to buy either.	Non volui emere, vel.
You are not right.	Non recte.
I never said it.	numquam id dixi.
There were some ways out of this.	Fuisse aliquo modo ex hoc.
No better for him.	Nec illum melius.
And if this were true.	Et si hoc verum esset.
I just do it.	Modo fac.
You can see it too.	Etiam id videre potes.
In this way it is different.	Hoc modo aliud est.
Either he likes or wants.	Vel velit vel velit.
But nothing is like it.	Sed nihil simile est.
He thinks he can do well.	Bene se putat posse.
Only the first floor.	Solum primum solum.
But that never was.	Sed id nunquam erat.
Maybe not from zero.	Aliquam non ex nulla.
More than usual.	Plus quam solebat.
He wants to do it by himself.	Facere velit per ipsum.
She told me about everything.	Illa mihi de omnibus indicavit.
He could not swim.	Natare non potuit.
In all .	In omnibus .
I've never heard anything like that.	Nunquam quicquam simile audivi.
I think they can still do it.	Puto adhuc posse id facere.
i thought i could go.	Putabam me posse ire.
TO THE HOME	AD DOMUM.
I'm out okay now!.	Sum de bene nunc!.
If there are any.	Si quae sunt.
There was always nothing in it.	Nulla in semper erat.
I don't know for sure.	Nescio certe.
This is the first time.	Hoc est primum.
Don't be honest.	Non sit amet.
So as where .	Ita ut ubi .
I can't see how it can help.	Non possum videre quomodo id adiuvet.
Was .	Erat .
That's what it was before.	Ut id erat ante.
But it is for the purpose.	Sed sit ad rem.
I wanted to forget her.	Oblitus vellem eius.
It's done for me.	Mihi factum est.
It was time.	Tempus erat.
It was probably indeed.	Probabiliter quidem fuit.
I need it so badly.	Tam male mihi opus est.
He didn't think so.	Non putabat.
I'm glad we did.	Gaudeo nos fecisse.
This is what	Hoc est quod.
The first kind is evil.	Primum genus mali est.
Almost at home.	Fere domi.
It was a great question.	Magna quaestio erat.
It's not the same as that.	Etiam non ipsum quam.
He's done the best.	Optime vult fieri.
He did, but not for long.	Fecit, sed non diu.
That's the same thing.	Ut id ipsum.
As he pleases.	Ut velit.
I've heard a lot about you.	Audivi de te multum.
And it is true.	Et verum sit.
It actually looks just like me.	Hoc quidem spectat solum sicut me.
This he did indeed.	Hoc vere ita fecit.
No one knows what it is.	Nemo scit quid sit.
Thus he had.	Sic habuit.
He's too much too.	Nimis ille nimis.
Again, I certainly don't want to.	Iterum certe nolo.
Had a bad day.	Malum diem habuit.
We don't think so.	Non puto nos.
This was not at all.	Hoc omnino non fuit.
But that is today.	Sed id hodie est.
That's what I feel right now.	Id nunc sentio.
This one is for me.	Hoc unum mihi est.
But there was more than that.	Aliquam sed erat quam.
Nothing I can do here.	Nihil hic facere possum.
I wonder if we have anything yet to talk about.	Miror si adhuc aliquid loqui habemus.
Well, it seems to me it was.	Bene, mihi videtur, fuit.
I feel so happy right now.	Sentio tam felix nunc.
It's good enough for me.	Mihi satis bonum est.
Right the first time.	Recte primum.
He never has me.	Numquam me habet.
I don't know where.	Nescio ubi.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
No one saw him again.	Nemo eum iterum vidit.
But that never happened.	Sed id numquam.
And there is no way to do it.	Et ut id facere nulla.
But not always.	Sed non semper.
What he did that day.	Quod fecit eo die.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
He did not like.	Nolebat.
And he did it.	Fecit autem.
Well, well, this is not true.	Bene, bene, hoc non est verum.
Maybe no one said it to him.	Fortasse nemo ei dixit.
I know all these things.	Novi ad haec omnia.
It was never very good.	Numquam valde bene fuit.
but he knew enough.	sed satis scivit.
They are not .	Non sunt .
But neither before nor before.	Sed non ante nec ante.
He does more.	Plus facit.
It was a great thing for me.	Erat mihi magna res.
I need help.	Mihi opus est auxilio.
That is for sure.	Certo id est.
And we.	Et nos.
He knows this, but he does not.	Novit hoc, sed non facit.
That's something right?	Id aliquid recte?
I have enough money.	Satis pecuniae habeo.
but it is.	sed est.
Too much is too much.	Nimis nimis est.
It seems that both are done.	Videtur utrumque factum.
But still.	Verum tamen.
Among these are .	Inter haec sunt .
That's what I'll do.	Id faciam.
I know, it is hard to believe.	Scio, difficile est credere.
Everything has time.	Omnia tempus habet.
It was time to leave.	Tempus erat relinquere.
He ought not to do this.	Hoc facere non debet.
He can't do this this year, but he.	Non potest hoc anno, sed ille.
You know this.	Scis hoc.
I didn't understand anything really.	Non intellexit aliquid vere.
Maybe someone is in front of you.	Aliquam quis ante est.
He wanted nothing to be.	Nihil esse voluit.
He is a good man.	Bonus homo est.
You are one.	Tu es unus.
Nor .	Nec .
But this was something new.	Sed hoc erat aliquid novi.
But do not believe.	Sed noli credere.
Well done to you.	Bene est tibi.
and the next night.	et nocte proxima.
I know you're going to do it.	Scio te facturum esse.
I did not say this.	Hoc non dixi.
Maybe in a day or so.	Forte in die vel sic.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
That is important.	Quod sit amet.
Or from her.	Vel a eius.
I wanted to know everything.	omnia scire volui.
It was not likely.	Verisimile non erat.
I don't always know.	Non semper scio.
There really wasn't much.	Vere ibi non multum erat.
You're not sure I could see.	Certus non es videre potui.
Who when .	Qui cum .
I am sure of that.	Certus sum de illo.
He had a house.	Domum habuit.
All I can say is talk a lot.	Omnia possum dicere multum loqui.
No, but there was some.	Nulla sed aliquam erat.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
This job was different.	Aliud erat hoc officium.
I have everything to do.	Habeo omnia facere.
Well, not really why.	Bene, non vere quare.
This was something else.	Hoc erat aliud.
But he could not do this.	Sed hoc facere non potuit.
That's not good.	Ut 'non est bonum.
Yes, it was hard to say no.	Ita est, difficile erat dicere non.
You have what you want.	Habes quod vis.
I can't thank you anymore.	Te amplius agere non possum.
that work is for you.	ut opus sit tibi.
If there were any, he would have it done.	Si quis esset, fieri vellet.
We cannot be certain of this.	De hoc certo non possumus.
It was mine.	Factum esse meum.
He speaks to me like this.	Mihi sic loquitur.
He was not, but	Non erat, sed.
I have not done well there.	Non bene ibi feci.
Thus he does.	Sic facit.
Nothing was seen of him.	Nihil ex eo videbatur.
no one does it.	id nemo.
Happy, happy, to him.	Felix, felix, sibi.
You can't tell me what you are doing.	Non potes mihi dicere quid facias.
I didn't want to say no.	Non nolui dicere.
Nothing like work.	Nihil simile opus.
But he certainly could not.	Sed certe non potuit.
Well, that's not exactly true.	Bene, non prorsus verum est.
I don't need to talk to you.	Non opus est loqui tecum.
Certainly it is well.	Certe bene est.
Always getting away from each other.	Questus inter se semper.
And if so.	Sic et si.
It was not good enough at home.	Satis domi non erat.
He could not yet know nothing.	Nihil scire se posse, nondum.
Who knows why? 	Quis scit quare?
It's so easy for you.	Tam facile tibi est.
He has nothing, but looks at all things.	Nihil habet, sed omnia spectat.
I could not do it.	facere non potui.
Who can't believe	Quis non credere potest.
I have something to do.	Habeo aliquid facere.
Well, no again.	Bene, nulla iterum.
But do it quickly.	Sed fac cito.
But I think there is some problem.	Sed puto esse aliquam quaestionem.
You know what you want.	Scis te velle.
Maybe a little too happy.	Fortasse paulo nimium felix.
That's when I need it.	Id cum opus est.
I don't need to look Rob.	Non opus est vultus facias.
It's time to love yourself.	Aliquam sit amet ipsum.
You can do whatever you want.	Facere potes tamen vis.
It's not about you.	Hoc non est de te.
Here's the question.	Hic quaestio est.
He was in it.	In eius erat.
He didn't want me anymore.	Noluit me amplius.
But he would not.	Noluit autem.
You don't need to come to me.	Non debes ad me venire.
Thus we are.	Sic sumus.
Which is also good.	Quod etiam bonum est.
I just did yesterday.	Ego iustus heri fecit.
I don't want to leave.	Non vis relinquere.
Whoever wants, will.	Qui velit, velit.
I believe we can do better than we can ever do.	Credo melius possumus, semper possumus.
You have to do something new.	Habes ut aliquid novi facias.
Looks like he can play.	Spectat ut ludere possit.
I think he can play.	Puto eum ludere posse.
He was a man.	Homo erat.
Kind of like what's here.	Genus simile quid hic.
It has been so long.	Tam diu fuit.
he knows better than to do.	melius novit quam facere.
There is no one to help us.	Nemo est qui nos adiuvet.
Well, not really.	Bene, non vere.
Nothing more for her.	Nihil amplius ad eam.
I was scared of race now.	Nunc genus vix fui.
He could not act.	Non potuit agere.
Yes, that's what I said.	Etiam id dictum quam.
I could not see correctly.	Recte videre non potui.
It's up to you to stop it.	Est ad vos prohibere est.
My father is gone.	Pater meus abiit.
Which was much better.	Quod multo melius fuit.
I thought you were right.	Putabam te ad rem esse.
To sit.	Ut sit.
It is time.	Tempus est.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Fortasse non vult.
Nothing has ever been said.	Nulla semper dictum est.
Someone to do it.	Aliquis facere id.
But that was bad.	Id autem malum esset.
Yes that's none other than that.	Etiam id quam nulla.
I feel very well this morning.	Hoc mane optime sentio.
Don't post it.	Non post eam.
The father here is not the father.	Pater hic non est pater.
No one but before.	Nulla quis nisi ante.
I can say this for sure now.	Hoc certo nunc dicere possum.
He was good to me.	Mihi bonus erat.
He says not even this.	Ne hoc quidem dicit.
But now not.	Sed nunc non.
I really like to see it.	Ego vere amo eam videre.
You don't want to know.	Et non vis scire.
Mine has been too long.	Mea quoque diu fuit.
But it is not true.	Sed non est verum.
Can't say what he wants.	Non potest dicere quod vult.
Yes, that's for some.	Etiam id aliquam enim.
But he cannot do it himself.	Sed facere se non potest.
We are still trying to find out.	Adhuc nos invenire conatur.
It was a great story.	Aliquam a erat magna.
But this was not true.	Sed hoc non erat verum.
and I saw you.	& vidi te.
To be honest with no one.	Ut sit amet nulla ex.
That's right.	Sic recte.
I want to believe this.	Hoc mihi credere volo.
I can't find you too.	Te quoque invenire non potest.
No one owes you anything.	Nemo tibi aliquid debet.
It was a great game.	Erat magna ipsum.
He knows where he is.	Scit ubi sit.
Nothing to me yet.	Nihil ad me tamen.
I always suspect it will be.	Semper suspicor fore.
I just don't want to.	Modo non vis.
Become a teacher.	Fieri magister.
I am too	Nimis ego sum .
Yes, that's very important.	Etiam id magna ipsum.
That's good to hear.	Quod bonum est audire.
All he does is work.	Omnia facit opus.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
He also doesn't want any.	Etiam non aliquam velit.
You shouldn't be here at this time.	Non debet hic esse hoc tempore.
It was exactly.	Erat prorsus.
Someone to talk to me.	Aliquis mecum loqui.
There is always something to do.	Semper est aliquid facere.
Too loud.	Nimis magna.
I can't do more about it.	Non possum amplius de illo facere.
I hope yours are better.	Spero melius esse tuum.
It was not I.	Non erat ego.
That's what I'll do.	Id faciam.
I don't know how he knew.	Nescio quomodo scivit.
It will be good for us all.	Bonum erit omnibus nobis.
We almost always got in trouble.	Semper fere nos in malum obtinuit.
not a lot of time.	Non multum temporis.
yes but only that.	Etiam non nisi quam.
It does not please .	Non placet .
And very happy.	Et sit amet ipsum.
But it was not enough.	Sed non satis erat.
I wish that it was not.	Utinam non sit.
Has, not had.	Habet, non habuit.
He was in that very thing.	In id ipsum erat.
We don't have the money.	Pecuniam non habemus.
Yes that was said out.	Etiam id dictum ex.
and this one.	et hoc unum.
Really for him.	Pro eo vere.
No one is quite sure why.	Nemo satis certus est quid.
He did not know what was my need.	Non, quod meum opus esset, sciebat.
Well, almost everyone.	Bene, fere omnes.
I'll tell you a little.	Dicam paulo.
My husband was all.	Meus vir erat omnes.
Well not long.	Bene non diu.
Well started.	Bene incepit.
We can't be.	Fieri non possumus.
Do nothing at all.	Prorsus nihil facias.
No, he did not come.	Non, non venit.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
He was not sure why.	Cur non certus erat.
For all.	Pro omnibus.
That's none.	Id nulla.
Look at the school.	Vide in schola.
So I like it enough.	Sic satis placet.
I will never know.	Nunquam scio.
The whole journey was in that day.	Totum iter in illa fuit.
She has to see it.	Videre eam habet.
how can i do this?.	Quomodo possum hoc ?.
You can get it here.	Accipere hic potes.
Not even that.	Ne id quidem.
Maybe never again.	Forsitan numquam iterum.
Or even a little later.	Vel etiam paulo post.
i feel good.	bene sentio.
But there is also another after the name.	Sed est etiam aliud post nomen.
No one knows what he means.	Nemo scit quid sibi velit.
But he was not a man.	Sed non erat vir.
It didn't take me long.	Non me diu.
I wanted to see this.	hoc videre volui.
He has not yet arrived.	Nondum per- venit.
Which seemed very unlikely.	Quod valde probabile videbatur.
I know I don't like it.	Scio non esse simile.
Hardly as it was.	Vix id ut erat.
I tried to talk.	Conatus dicere.
You know I didn't say yes or no.	Scis non dicere necne.
But I did not.	Ego autem non feci.
But it is not possible.	Sed id non potest.
Do what you like.	Quod facere libet.
The situation is as follows.	Res ita se habet.
But not as much as he wants.	Sed nec quam velit.
You did not make him.	Non fecisti eum.
I have known her for a long time.	Diu eam novi.
But much has yet to be done.	Sed multum adhuc faciendum est.
I can't stop it.	Non possum eam prohibere.
There was no evidence.	Nihil fuit quod.
We don't have money for it.	Pecuniam pro eo non habemus.
It was to you.	Ad te erat.
That's the only time.	Id solum tempus.
No one knows this.	Hoc nemo scit.
But you cannot accept this.	Sed hoc non potes accipere.
It is not probable.	Probabile non est.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
It was this.	Erat hoc.
I hope all is well here and the same.	Bene hic omnes et idem spero.
I can't leave him.	Eum relinquere non possum.
But he thought he was probably doing fine.	Sed putabat se probabiliter facere bene.
That is.	Illa est.
I just want it.	Ego iustus volo eam.
I don't want one anymore.	Nolo unum amplius.
It is not certain.	Certum non est.
But certainly.	Sed certe.
Well, not much.	Bene, non multum.
I heard them all.	Audivi omnes.
He wouldn't even know you're here.	Noluit quidem scire te hic esse.
He was mine.	Meus ipse fuit.
which something I wanted.	quam aliquid volui.
Maybe that's a great idea.	Aliquam id dictum magna.
You have done this well.	Hoc bene fecisti.
I don't have time to do something.	Non tempus ad aliquid faciendum.
I haven't forgotten you.	Non te oblitus est.
I always wanted him to go.	Eo ire semper volui.
Maybe not great or none at all.	Aliquam nec magna vel nulla.
Not a little, but much.	Nec parum, sed multum.
Absolutely certainly possible.	Omnino certe fieri potest.
Nothing to see here.	Nihil hic videre.
But nothing is to be done.	Sed fieri nihil est.
I know as much as anyone.	Hoc scio quantum quis.
This is to stay.	Hic est manere.
been there for a long time.	Ibi diu est.
What is wrong with you.	Quod malum est tibi.
Probably true.	Verisimiliter verum est.
To or to whom.	Ut vel quam est.
He could not do this.	Hoc facere potuit.
I have done it.	id feci.
And there is absolutely nothing wrong.	Et omnino nihil mali est.
He inquired why.	Quaesivit quare.
Tomorrow is not the same thing.	Cras non ipsum nisi.
That's just what you want to say.	Hoc modo vis dicere.
I didn't know what to do.	Ego nesciebam quid faciendum esset.
This is something else.	Hoc est aliud.
but he has.	sed habet.
Don't come home tonight.	Noli hac nocte per domum venire.
I've been thinking a lot about this lately.	Haec nuper multa cogitavi.
It's getting up too much.	Nimis suus questus est ei.
He has nothing but .	Non nisi habet .
It seems to you like this.	Vobis sic videtur.
It is better not to know.	Melius est nescire.
That's what I need too.	Id quoque mihi opus est.
I don't have time to go.	Non tempus ut.
I tried the same thing again.	Conatus iterum idem.
That's a great way to get out of it.	Ut id magna ex.
The situation is the same.	Ita se res habet.
Better than it was.	Melius quam erat.
Or: He gave the time of day.	Vel : DIES TEMPORE DEDIT.
never was, never will be.	numquam fuit, numquam erit.
too young if need be.	etiam puer, si opus sit.
.	.
I don't doubt that.	Quod non dubito.
they are all.	Omnes sunt.
He doesn't want to do it.	Non vult facere.
I think too often that's true.	Puto nimis saepe verum esse.
I couldn't think of anything.	Non potui cogitare de aliquo.
It was easy to understand.	Facile erat intelligere.
But we have not here.	Sed non habemus hic.
I really like him.	Ego vere similis ei.
I don't like traveling.	Non placet iter.
I'll be working for you.	Et opus erit tibi.
may or may not be.	Ut vel non sit.
I'm sorry about everything.	Paenitet me de omnibus.
But not well.	Sed non bene.
I want to do so.	Sic facere volo.
Maybe someone wants.	Aliquam quis velit.
This one is different.	Hic aliud est.
This is so true.	Hoc tam verum est.
Yes we are too.	Ita nimium sumus.
This is nothing.	Hoc est nihil.
That doesn't work very well.	Id non optime facit.
I can't talk for a long time.	Non possum diu loqui.
This should be really good.	Hoc vere bonum esse debet.
It will be either tonight or tomorrow afternoon.	Vel hac nocte vel cras post meridiem erit.
We have to leave.	Habere nos relinquere.
You are a boy	Puer es .
which I think is good.	quod bonum esse puto.
That is certain.	Quod certum est.
Bad for you.	Malum tibi.
In order to get yourself none.	Ut ut ipsum nulla.
No one seemed to know what to say.	Videbatur nemo scire quid dicam.
There's no time to have a great time.	Nulla ut tempus magna.
Usually by men.	Fere homines.
I could not leave him.	Eum relinquere non potui.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
It is totally gone.	Prorsus non abiit.
But he alone cannot do it.	Sed solus id facere non potest.
I will not do it.	Non faciam.
Went to lunch.	Ad prandium abiit.
The father did it.	Pater^ fecit.
He did not think that he wanted to know.	Non putabat se scire velle.
Don't do this quickly.	Non hoc cito.
He didn't want to see her.	Noluit eam videre.
No, not.	Non, non.
Not me, everybody.	Non mihi, omnibus.
Nothing surprises me.	Nihil miror.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
You can do all that here.	Omnia quae hic facere potes.
Who does not .	Qui non .
He didn't want to do it himself.	Noluit ipse sibi facere.
Advice, counsel	Consilium, consilium.
We both know what will happen.	Nos ambo quid futurum sit.
I just couldn't get it.	Ego iustus quod accipere non potuit.
I wonder how well this will do.	Miror quam bene hoc facturus sit.
The father could not do anything.	Pater aliquid facere non potuit.
For us indeed this is good.	Nobis quidem hoc bonum est.
We're here to help you.	Hic sumus ut adiuvet te.
His first name	Primum nomen eius ad .
I just can't be with him.	Modo non sit cum illo.
I guess you have a house for that.	Suspicor te habere domum pro illo.
Yesterday was correct.	Heri recte erat.
That's pretty easy.	Id satis facile.
You know you're there.	Scis te ibi esse.
She told me not.	Non indicavit mihi.
I would do anything to help.	Facturum me aliquid adiuvare.
But he did not know where.	Sed nesciebat ubi.
still please.	adhuc placet.
I have no interest.	Non habeo rem.
He understood the job.	Intellexit officium.
You are certainly not alone.	Solus certe non es.
We can't go there now.	Nunc illuc ire non possumus.
Now he knows better.	Nunc melius novit.
Not sure what she is going to do.	Non certus est quid facturus sit.
I have been through this.	Per me hoc fui.
I have been there many times.	Ibi saepe fui.
But like him.	Sed ut ipsum.
I can't say why now.	Quare nunc non possum dicere.
I guess that was necessary.	Suspicor quod necesse fuit.
Who	Qui .
He thinks you've done it.	Cogitat te fecisse.
He did not say anything about him.	Non dixit aliquid de illo.
He is gone.	Abiit .
He would have done the same.	Idem facturum fuisse.
It was good.	Bonus fuit.
I can do all things.	Omnia possum.
Get yourself in.	Ut ipsum in.
But there is only one.	Sed non est nisi.
I'm just doing this for me.	Im 'iustus hoc mihi facis.
That was one thing.	Id unum erat.
not really good.	Non vere bonum.
But we can't do it without you.	Sed id sine te facere non possumus.
We can do better now.	Nunc melius facere possumus.
I know how easy it is to do it.	Facile scio eum facere.
I think people want to.	Puto velle.
Do not think .	Noli cogitare .
I wish I could get better.	Melius vellem accipere.
I just didn't know what she was doing.	Modo quid illa nesciebat.
He could not speak.	Non potuit dicere.
Maybe you could do better.	Forsitan melius facere.
You did exactly what you said.	Fecisti prorsus quod dixisti.
Everyone knows me.	Nescit me.
Nothing seemed difficult.	Nihil difficile videbatur.
That's not what you mean.	Quod non sit tibi est.
It is not difficult to see why this is so.	Cur ita sit, non difficile est videre.
Soon however.	Mox tamen.
The job was not.	Quod officium non fuit.
I'm going all the time.	Eo semper.
Nothing was before.	Nihil erat ante.
He refused to speak.	Noluit loqui.
That's too soon.	Quod nimium cito.
I can't be alone with me.	Non possum solus mecum.
But that's not always.	Sed id non semper.
It wasn't looking good.	Is vultus bonus non fuit.
You can stay with me.	Potes apud me manere.
But that's none of it.	Sed id nulla ex.
There is no one but nothing.	Nulla quis nisi nisi.
Yes but no great.	Etiam sed nulla magna.
today I don't know.	hodie nescio.
I have money.	Pecuniam habeo.
It does not please.	Non placet.
Is good.	Bonus est.
I forgot.	Oblitus sum.
But it was for a time.	Sed ad tempus erat.
But it is not quite true.	Sed non satis verum est.
Or all at once.	Vel omnes simul.
What could he do?	Quid potuit.
Stay with me now.	Mane nunc mecum.
He wanted time to go and get in together.	Tempus simul ire et in voluit.
He cannot say this.	Hoc dicere non potest.
For it is not.	Non enim.
I have done everything.	Omnia feci.
You know what you need.	Scis quid tibi opus sit.
It is not difficult.	Non est difficile.
But see to yourself.	Sed vide tibi.
Packed as one.	Facis ut unum.
That car has been with me for so long.	Mecum fuit ille currus tam diu.
I just didn't want to believe it.	Modo nolebat credere.
Here, for a long time.	Hic, diu.
And still for it.	Et adhuc enim.
This person just doesn't do it.	Hic homo iustus non facere.
Which is fine.	Quod bene sit.
Too much respect.	Nimium quantum.
He could not find her again.	Adhuc eam invenire non potuit.
I can't live without you anymore.	Sine te amplius vivere non possum.
The problem is that we can't see it.	Quaestio est ut eam videre non possumus.
Yes that's great.	Etiam id magna.
This is easy enough.	Hoc satis facile est.
I heard about you.	Audivi de te.
Nothing is nothing.	Nulla res nulla est.
There is a lot to be done.	Multum est faciendum.
To do a lot.	Facere sit amet.
That was too much.	Nimium id erat.
He wants to get out there.	Ut ex velit est.
They are not very good.	Non sunt valde bona.
This man could not leave his wife here.	Hic suam hic relinquere non potuit.
You know what he wants.	Scis quid sibi velit.
Don't get sick.	Non male.
He looks at the thing he looks at.	Spectat ad rem spectat.
He wanted to talk to her.	Loqui voluit ad eam.
That's where he was himself.	Ut in erat ipsum.
You never know why.	Numquam cur.
It is certainly bad.	Malum certe est.
If you do it will be very difficult.	Id si feceris, erit valde difficile.
Now is the time to love yourself.	Nunc tempus est ut ipsum.
Now that's nothing.	Nunc id nisi.
No, that's true.	Non, quod verum est.
and only do this.	et hoc solum fac.
But still a wife.	Sed tamen uxorem.
But that's none of it.	Sed id ipsum nulla.
Truly it was .	Vere erat .
All she was doing was saying yes.	Omnia illa facere erat etiam dicere.
Really tried.	Vere conatus est.
It could very well be.	Optime potuit esse.
But there was none.	Sed non nulla erat.
I am surprised so much, this is all.	Miror tantum, hoc totum est.
Which could not be true.	Quod verum esse potuit.
So I'd like to travel.	Sic libet iter.
There was no shipment before.	Nulla sit amet ante erat.
But he wants to be himself.	Sed ut ipsum velit.
People are evil.	Homines malum.
No one wants it.	Nulla id ipsum velit.
It has nothing to do with me.	Nihil ad me habet.
the things that I do.	quae me facio.
Only you can understand and accept.	Tantum potes intelligere et accipere.
I know you too.	Novi te quoque.
When we are seen we cannot understand.	Cum videri non possumus intelligere.
But not in all.	Sed non in omnibus.
Well if all is well but.	Bene si omnia bene sed.
But he never did it.	Sed numquam id fecit.
And he would not give it.	Et nolebat eam dare.
It's not a good decision.	Non est consilium bonum.
Got a job plus a job.	Plus officium obtinuit officium.
This is not possible.	Quod fieri non potest.
It's good and bad.	Est bonum et malum.
He says you haven't been.	Dicit te non fuisse.
He said he wanted something more.	Plus aliquid velle dixit.
It sure wasn't like this before.	Is certus non erat sic ante.
I don't think it's going to happen.	Non puto futurum.
I was not alone either.	Solus vel non eram.
We are not together with him.	Non una cum illo sumus.
You can't do more, you can't buy more.	Plus facere non potes, plus emere non potes.
But that's the same thing too.	Sed id ipsum etiam.
Without him he certainly can't do it.	Sine eo certe facere non potest.
But it's not enough for me.	Sed non satis est mihi.
But as stated above.	Sed ut dictum est.
That would be my first time.	Quod me primum fore.
Nothing is enough for me.	Nihil mihi satis.
But not from great things.	Sed non ex magna.
We're here when you need it.	Hic sumus, cum opus est.
and you are not alone.	et solus non es.
He has gone, he has just gone.	Abiit, modo abiit.
I've already got the first guy.	Ego iam primum guy obtinuit.
But none is none.	Nulla autem nulla est.
I feel good about it.	Bene sentio de illo.
He said a little.	Dixit parum.
We all have.	Nos omnes habemus.
He should not.	Non debet.
And it's not really hard.	Et vere non est difficile.
Or to no one.	Vel ut nulla quis.
One thing is for sure.	Una res est certe.
It is not difficult.	Non est difficile.
Really sorry, really.	Paenitet vere, vere.
He is truly good.	Vere est ille bonus.
No one knows where he is now.	Nemo scit ubi nunc sit.
I will not do it for you.	Non faciam tibi.
Nothing is gonna be great.	Ut nulla sit amet magna.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
Not all.	Non omnes.
We can't do much.	Non multum possumus.
It's pretty good.	Satis bene est.
I didn't see you yesterday.	Non te vidi heri.
It was good.	Bonum erat.
That's how he was alone.	Solus erat id quam.
He knew how to do it, but had no idea.	Novit modo facere sed nesciebat.
Nothing like that happened.	Ut nihil factum.
He seems to be doing much better.	Multo melius facere videtur.
He wanted to be alone.	Solus esse voluit.
But something was wrong.	Sed male aliquid fuit.
He did not disclose his name.	Nomen suum non indicavit.
Do good work with him.	Bonum opus fac cum eo.
We do not do that.	Non quod nos.
He is the one who comes after me.	Ipse est qui post me venit.
You need to give it a go.	Ire dare debes.
Good if you think.	Bonum si cogitas.
What things	Quae res.
There you don't like it.	Ibi non placet.
It would be like this one.	Sicut hoc unum esset.
It should be done.	Fieri debet.
I think they should not.	Puto noluisse.
We want to understand each other.	Inter se intelligere nos volo.
He inquired why.	Quaesivit quare.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
I hope not for this.	Hoc non spero.
He does it right.	Recte facit.
I would like to have it again.	Iterum habere vellem.
The boy is still there.	Puer adhuc ibi est.
You can only learn it.	Tantum modo id scire potes.
I know exactly what it is.	Prorsus scio quid sit.
No one wanted him here.	Hic eum nemo voluit.
For what he did not say.	Quid enim non dixit.
Please be honest.	Sit amet velit.
If he were to do it .	Si id faceret .
I could not accept that.	Quod accipere non potui.
Nothing is more important than that.	Nulla sit amet magna quam.
He loves all and all.	Omnes et omnia amat.
He didn't want to be with her.	Noluit apud se esse.
Never was, never will.	Numquam fuit, numquam erit.
That's what he was doing.	Id se facere.
No one asked how he was there.	Nemo quaesivit quomodo ibi esset.
This is also good.	Hoc etiam bonum est.
I am surprised I love you.	Miror amo.
But she does nothing.	Sed haec nihil agit.
When he is there, he is there.	Cum ibi est, ibi est.
He was a boy.	Puer erat.
This was a journey.	Hoc erat iter.
But we cannot do this.	Sed hoc facere non possumus.
He said that he would do it, that he could not come hither.	Facturum se dixit se huc venire non posse.
Which is not true at all.	Quod omnino non est verum.
But to win is to win.	Sed vincere est vincere.
I want to do everything with me.	Mecum facere omnibus volo.
He did not want to know who was with him.	Noluit scire quis cum eo esset.
But not always the same.	Sed non semper ipsum.
that would be.	id esset.
I thought it was a great trip.	Magna putabam iter.
but better than he knew.	sed melius quam sciebat.
She asked what he should do.	Rogavit quid faceret.
Maybe who was the only one.	Aliquam quis erat nisi.
I just never did.	Modo numquam.
We didn't do anything wrong.	Nos nihil mali facere non.
I believe so.	Ita credo.
But this is not so.	Sed hoc non ita est.
I think I want to talk.	Puto me velle loqui.
Live without me today.	Sine me hodie vivere.
But it was not before.	Sed non erat ante.
I think this is one way to go.	Hoc unum puto iter.
Paul.	Paulo.
As he told you.	Sicut dixit vobis.
I don't want to talk to you like this.	Nolo sic tecum loqui.
He wanted this longer for himself.	Hanc sibi diutius voluit.
But much more than that.	Sed multo quam id ipsum.
I'm not alone with me.	Im 'non solum de me.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
I know you.	Scio te.
He knew he wanted both.	Scivit se utrumque velle.
He did not know what to do next.	Nesciebat quid faciendum.
I hope you're doing great.	Spero tibi magna.
I did not say nothing.	Non dixi nihil.
I am scared and alone.	vix et solus sum.
Unless there is another.	Nisi aliud est.
So exactly the same.	Ita prorsus idem.
It's not what you have.	Non est quod habes.
I could not say anything.	Non potui aliquid dicere.
Now save.	Nunc nisi.
I want you to come with us.	Volo te nobiscum venire.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
It is and is.	Est et est.
You want to help, but you don't want to.	Adiuvare vis quidem, sed non vis.
But he only wants it.	Sed id velit nisi.
Good day all!.	Die enim bona omnia!.
I don't believe it enough.	nec satis credo.
I don't like the affair with anyone.	Non ut rem quis.
he caused this to be done.	id fieri fecit.
I do this to you as much as I do.	Hoc tibi quantum me facio.
He didn't say anything to me.	Non dixit mihi quicquam.
Things are not going well with him.	Res non recte cum eo.
But there was a need now.	Nunc opus erat, sed.
i have so much to say about it.	tantum habeo de eo dicere.
There was too much to be done.	Nimium erat faciendum.
If it is so, it is good.	Si ita est, bonum est.
You have me up.	Habes me usque.
And you? 	Et tu?
.	.
Where are they?	Ubi sunt.
It would seem that it is so.	Videtur quod ita sit.
Now, now.	Nunc, nunc.
The day is too much.	Dies nimium est.
I have to say the truth.	Habeo verum dicere.
I feel something here.	Aliquid hic sentio.
So it is.	Ita est.
It is good.	Bene est.
He seems to have done well.	Bene fecisse videtur.
must be done.	Faciendum est.
He does not come.	Non venit.
He was not.	Non erat.
That's fine if you help me.	Ut bene, si me adiuvet.
Not likely, but possible.	Non verisimile, sed fieri potest.
I don't think you understand everything.	Non puto te omnia intelligere.
It's different!.	Est aliud!.
But he said nothing.	Sed nihil dixit.
At home every morning.	Domi omnes mane.
And Mary told him all things about him.	Maria autem dixit ei omnia de eo.
Men, you know.	Homines, tu scis.
He knew he could not believe it.	Sciebat se non credere.
That's not true.	Id nec.
No one buys it.	Nemo emit.
But this certainly was necessary.	Sed hoc certe opus fuit.
Certainly he did not say nothing for a time.	Certe nihil ad tempus non dixit.
Nothing is gonna be none at all.	Nulla sit amet nulla nulla.
Acting is one bad thing.	Agere unum malum est.
I was still scared of her race.	Genus tamen eius vix fui.
I don't know, but	Nescio, sed.
But really none.	Sed vere nulla.
It was a good question, though.	Bona quaestio fuit, sed.
It will be more likely next time.	Verisimile erit iterum plus.
Yes that is a question.	Ita ut quaestio est.
But this seemed quite probable.	Sed id satis probabile videbatur.
He also was.	Is quoque erat.
This is who and what we are.	Hic est quis et quod sumus.
I know nothing about this yet.	Ego nihil de hoc adhuc novi.
It is bad.	Malum est.
You've done nothing wrong.	Tu nihil mali feceris.
It is possible, but it is hardly probable.	Fieri potest, sed vix probabile est.
We don't have it here.	Non id habemus hic.
That it may be one, but something.	Ut unum sit, sed aliquid.
Maybe he never knew.	Fortasse numquam scivit.
Among us too.	Inter nos quoque.
There could not have been a meal without you.	Sine te prandium fieri non potuit.
I feel a lot better about this.	Multum melius de hoc sentio.
It would be a great success.	Magna res esset.
Do.	Facere.
I don't want to be able to talk.	Nolo loqui posse.
He gave me only advice.	Solum consilium mihi dedit.
Your time is going to be.	Tempus tuum futurum est.
Seems too bad.	Etiam malum videtur.
But neither seemed likely.	Sed nec verisimile videbatur.
This one is.	Hoc unum est.
It's not that hard.	Non esse difficile est.
I don't want one day yet.	Nolo tamen unum diem.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
Is there a way to do this?	Estne iter hoc facere?
This will not be true.	Quod quidem non erit.
i love doing it.	amo is facio.
Make your own.	Fac tua.
And he could do well.	Et bene potuit.
Not much.	Non multum.
He didn't have time, he didn't want to know.	Tempus non habuit, scire noluit.
That I do not like it, but it has been said.	Ut non placet, sed dictum est.
I can do nothing.	nihil possum facere.
You can see mine here.	Meum hic videre potes.
I'm not good anymore.	Non sum bonus amplius.
I think it's not good.	Puto non bonum.
In .	In .
He left friends.	Amicos reliquit.
No one says this.	Nemo hoc dicit.
i thought i would be the only one.	unum solum fore putavi.
But perhaps it was.	Sed forte erat.
Or save it.	Vel nisi id.
I really understood.	Ego vere intellexit.
I don't want to say yes.	Nolo etiam dicere.
He is alone yet alone.	Solus adhuc solus est.
Better yet, rightly so.	Sed melius, recte.
There will not always be.	Non est nec erit semper.
Really need you.	Vere opus est tibi.
what is to be done?	quid faciendum?.
No one really knew what the guy was like.	Nemo vere sciebat quid simile guy.
I hope to post again soon.	Spero te mox post iterum.
He said that he would go.	Dixit se ire.
No one knows what is true.	Nemo scit quid verum sit.
You are right.	Recte facis.
I am sure everything will be fine.	Certus sum omnia esse bene.
As soon as we are here.	Ut iam nos hic sumus.
It looks so good.	Spectat ut bene.
That is certain.	Certum est id.
I do everything.	Omnia facio.
All these things are good.	Haec omnia bona sunt.
All right here now.	Omnia recte hic, nunc.
It was one thing to do.	Erat unum facere.
Not too much.	Non nimis.
We have so much with us.	Tantum apud nos habemus.
He is gone.	Abiit.
He would not be here without all.	Noluit hic esse sine omnibus.
I was out there.	de ibi fui.
This man is a pretty guy.	Hic homo satis guy.
I am astonished at this.	Miror hoc.
may have been one.	ut unum fuisse.
This was very difficult.	Hoc erat admodum difficile.
To appreciate right now.	Ut bene nunc.
However, I can't believe someone wants to.	Tamen non potest credere aliquem velle.
But this is good.	Sed haec bona est.
He also had this question.	Habuit etiam hanc quaestionem.
You don't need to stop.	Non opus est te prohibere.
There it is, soon for you.	Ibi est, cito pro te.
It's not bad.	Malum non est.
They're sure, you know.	Sunt certe, tu scis.
And here it is .	Et hic sit .
And this is perhaps true today.	Et hoc fortasse hodie verum est.
Get what you need.	Accipere debes quod est.
But we have not this.	Sed hoc non habemus.
not not.	ne non.
It's in everything.	Est in omnibus.
never after the first time.	numquam post primum.
This was what I could think of.	Hoc erat quod potuit cogitare.
I couldn't take it anymore.	Non potui amplius accipere.
Seems like a good guy.	Sicut bonus guy videtur.
Everything is great.	Omnia magna.
Well, only one.	Bene, nisi unum.
He says also.	Dicit etiam.
I need to talk about it.	De eo loqui debeo.
There is still work.	Adhuc opus est.
Maybe they're all the same.	Forsitan omnes idem sunt.
But that is not the case.	Sed id ipsum non est.
He did this well for me.	Hoc bene mihi fecit.
This should not be done.	Hic fieri non debet.
Which I don't like.	Quod non placet.
Or so it seemed to him.	Vel ita sibi videbatur.
This can be very bad.	Hoc potest esse valde malum.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum ut.
No more than necessary.	Nulla quam necesse est.
Both are evil.	Malum est utrumque.
It is true.	Verum est.
It is not true.	Verum non est.
Only one man could do it.	Unus homo solus illud facere non potuit.
It was always from New Orleans.	Aliquam a semper erat.
I don't know anyone yet.	Nescio quis adhuc.
I just want her to be here right now.	Ego iustus volo eam iam hic esse.
I really wanted to live here.	Vere vellem hic vivere.
That's never going to happen.	Quod numquam futurum est.
That's the best way to do it.	Quod optime facere.
It was too late.	Sero erat.
It has been a long time.	Diu fuit.
But that's what you do.	Sed id quam id facis.
It is definitely bad now.	Certo iam malum.
My mom wants them alone.	Illa solum meum, vult.
But he knew and said to him.	Scivit autem et dixit ei.
None but none.	Nulla sed nulla.
He refused to speak.	Loqui noluit.
I know you don't really do what you want.	Scio te non vere facere quod vis.
He knows how to be happy.	Scit quam felix sit.
He does what he wills not.	Quod non vult, facit.
But not for him.	Sed non ipsum enim.
He did not know who it was.	Nesciebat quis esset.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
Maybe it wasn't.	Aliquam non erat.
The shipment is ready.	Paratus sit amet.
I've never seen this evil before.	Nunquam ante hoc malum vidi.
Someone buys it again.	Aliquis iterum emit.
This he did indeed.	Id quidem fecit.
He also wants to take time.	Etiam ut tempus velit.
That was almost.	Id erat fere.
I saw yesterday.	heri vidi.
She could not think at all.	Non posset omnino cogitare.
He refused to give me a name.	Noluit mihi nomen dare.
I want everything for her.	Omnia volo ad eam.
The man tries to talk.	Vir loqui conatur.
However someone appears.	Tamen aliquis videtur.
I know everyone here too.	Scio hic quoque omnes.
I know them all.	Novi omnes.
He would not hear any more.	Noluit amplius audire.
The plan was there, though.	Fuisse ibi consilium, sed.
You are so doing well.	Tam bene facere.
Please don't do it.	Quaeso ne feceris.
I never know for sure.	Numquam certe scio.
Boy, never.	Puer, umquam.
If this is so.	Id si ita est.
I can't for sure.	Non possum certe.
We can't do what we get.	Non possumus facere quam accipere.
This should not be done.	Hoc fieri non debet.
But as you do.	Sed ut tu.
I can do it.	Ad id facere possum.
Certainly not Tom.	Certe non Tom.
Nothing was true.	Nihil erat verum.
It looks like there.	Simile ibi videtur.
Well, a little.	Bene, parum.
I do not have.	Non habeo.
I also need to be true.	Mihi quoque verum esse debeo.
I've never heard anything like it before.	Nunquam ante aliquid simile audivi.
Nothing comes to me.	Nihil ad me venit.
As you like.	Ut libet.
he did something.	fecit aliquid.
It's yours now!.	Tuum est nunc!.
All mine are there.	Omnia mea sunt ibi.
That's how important it is.	Ut sit amet est quam.
So you're really here.	Ita vere hic es.
He can do both.	Utrumque potest.
Maybe before that time.	Aliquam id tempus ante.
You'd tell her everything was fine.	Dicere ei omnia bene esse velis.
To this day	Ad hanc diem.
Hard to say for sure.	Dicere difficile est pro certo.
Not much at all.	Non multum omnino.
There i'm one and only one.	Ibi sum unum et unum solum.
It will be true.	Verum erit.
There must be something about it.	Debet esse aliquid de illa.
He knew everything.	Ille omnia sciebat.
He was not busy.	Non erat occupatus.
he ought to act.	agere debet.
This is good and bad.	Hoc est bonum et malum.
It's very easy to understand.	Ipsum facile est intelligere.
Look how well you did.	Vide quam bene feceris.
There are things.	Sunt res.
Well had something.	Bene aliquid habuit.
I never said no.	Non dixi numquam.
And he knew how much.	Sciebat autem et quantum.
And rightly indeed.	Et recte quidem.
I completely forgot him.	Eum ego omnino oblitus eram.
I tried to work.	Conatus sum opus.
He didn't know what was going on either.	Nesciebat quid esset amplius, vel.
I think it's done both, just not at the same time.	Utrumque factum puto, modo non simul.
This is my advice.	Hoc meum consilium est.
He had no more in himself.	Non habuit in se amplius.
I can do something.	Aliquid facere possum.
Yes, I am not a man.	Etiam homo non sum.
Right, you said.	Recte, dixisti.
This will not be easy.	Hoc facile non erit.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
Let's say something.	Sit aliquid.
That was most likely.	Id verisimile erat.
This is all you are always thinking about.	Hoc totum est quod semper cogitas.
Has a question.	Habet quaestionem.
It was a difficult job.	Difficile erat officium.
As it was, and now, and always.	Sicut erat, et nunc, et semper.
He was the only one to do so.	Solus erat id.
He doesn't know anything about him.	Nescit quid de illo.
Now it's better.	Iam melius est.
He seems to be doing a lot of things.	Multum facere videtur.
I do not love.	Non amo.
If you want to.	Si vis.
Certainly he gave it to me.	Mihi certe dedit.
He knew that he could give him nothing more.	Sciebat se nihil amplius ei dare posse.
He would not.	Noluit.
I just wonder about that.	Modo miror quod.
You can know.	Scire potes.
I thought of going home.	Cogitavi domum.
He wants to leave the house.	Domum relinquere non vult.
I think everybody was scared.	Vix puto omnes fuisse.
Thus he did.	Sic fecit.
Nothing about him.	Nihil de eo.
Not in class at all.	Non genus omnino.
I believe the same will be true for you.	Credo idem tibi verum erit.
I don't know what else.	Nescio quid aliud.
But that is in save.	Sed id est in nisi.
Here I am.	Hic sum.
The same thing is still true.	Idem quod adhuc verum est.
I love you and you know you too.	Amo te, et scis tu quoque.
Maybe it was better like this.	Fortasse melius fuit sic.
That's not right.	Quod non recte.
It is a great thing.	Res magna est.
We like it and we're good.	Id nobis placet et bonum sumus.
Not even the same meal.	Non etiam idem prandium.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
It was all about.	Is erat de omnibus.
Better, better, better.	Melius, melius, melius.
I like it enough.	Mihi satis placet.
I love you but not enough.	Amo te, sed non satis est.
You are truly just.	Vere iustus es.
Not much in this.	Non in hoc multum.
You can certainly speak of him.	Certe de eo loqui potes.
i have a job.	officium habeo.
If at all.	Si omnino.
Which is well true.	Quod bene verum sit.
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
I will say please.	Dicam placet.
Maybe that was nothing.	Aliquam ut erat nisi.
That was not.	Quod non erat.
I said he would not.	Noluit dixi.
Nothing to find.	Nihil invenire.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
This seems difficult.	Hoc difficile videtur.
Maybe he was here.	Forte hic fuit.
You said it was not going to happen.	Dixisti non futurum.
For us all.	Pro nobis omnibus.
You can be all right now.	Omnia iam potes esse.
But that's the same thing now.	Sed id nunc ipsum.
It was my job to find out.	Meum fuit officium invenire.
I wanted to talk to someone about this.	Dicere volui de hoc aliquo.
The first is to believe only.	Primum est tantum credere.
To come here.	Venire huc.
And in me too.	Et in me quoque.
This was done afterward.	Post hoc factum est.
I could do this now.	Hoc nunc facere potui.
No one knows him.	Nemo eum novit.
he did not know where he was.	nesciebat ubi esset.
He didn't want to do it too much.	Nolebat id nimis.
But we can do better.	Sed melius facere possumus.
I would not be able to do so.	Nolui facere posse.
He didn't want to play with him.	Noluit ludere cum eo.
This would be bad.	Malum hoc esset.
He knew what this meant.	Sciebat quid hoc esset.
The whole time.	Totum tempus.
If nothing else, it is better than what was done before.	Si nihil aliud, melius est quam id quod factum est ante.
No one knows what this is.	Hoc quid sit, nemo scit.
Look at that guy.	Vide illud guy.
Not great, great.	Non magna, magna.
Do what you really want.	Quod vere facere velis.
So which was better, much better.	Ita quod melius erat, multo melius.
But not much for me.	Sed non multum mihi.
Maybe that's great.	Aliquam ut magna.
But who only save.	Sed quis nisi nisi.
There is no one except one.	Nulla quis ex nisi.
He did the same for all.	Idem fecit omnibus.
The first season isn't very good.	Primum tempus non ipsum bonum.
I know it won't be the same.	Non idem erit scio.
i never thought about it.	numquam de eo cogitavi.
Certainly not so.	Non ita est certe.
When it comes, it is good.	Cum venit, bonum est.
I told him never to call me again.	Dixi ei numquam me iterum.
That was lucky.	Quod felix fuit.
But you know it's possible.	Scis tamen posse.
I never forgot the look.	Numquam vultus oblitus est.
But I wish there was a lot to do.	Sed sit amet velit erat.
This was much better.	Hoc multo melius fuit.
No no no.	Nulla non nulla.
One thing I know for sure.	Unum pro certo scio.
But still a.	Sed adhuc a.
And there seems to be only one thing to do.	Et videtur unum modo facere.
I would not hear this.	Hoc audire nolui.
What he saw was not a great thing.	Quam vidit non erat res magna.
You have to find something like that for sure.	Pro certo habes simile aliquid invenire.
Maybe this was not good.	Fortasse hoc non erat bonum.
I don't quite know what to say to you.	Non satis scio quid tibi dicam.
I don't know what to look like right now.	Nescio quid nunc simile.
Maybe that's how he played.	Aliquam id quam ipsum.
My dad was at home.	Pater meus domi erat.
And here we are now.	Et hic nunc sumus.
It should be pretty great.	Sit satis magna.
Maybe it was before.	Aliquam sed ante erat.
But that was great.	Sed id magna erat.
Nothing is but some, that is some.	Nulla sed aliquam est, id aliquam est.
And what not.	Et quid non.
The dog could not have been like tomorrow.	Potuit canis sicut cras non erat.
i have it.	eam habeo.
I can see what you mean.	Quid vis videre possum.
I have seen him already.	Iam illum vidi.
No one wants any.	Nulla id aliquam velit.
For a long time he said nothing.	Diu nihil aliud dixit.
Someone, something for someone.	Aliquis, rem ad aliquem.
But always.	Sed semper.
I think we'll be fine.	Puto nos bene erit.
I saw him.	eum vidi.
It's not all.	Eum non omnes.
I have done this.	Hoc feci.
I do not like.	Mihi non placet.
He only knew that he was speaking.	Hic tantum sciebat se loqui.
It must have been.	Fuisse necesse est.
Again none of that much for me.	Iterum nemo ex eo multum mihi.
She was very happy.	Illa nimis felix eram.
I love you too.	Te quoque amo.
I don't mean to be.	Non vult esse.
I looked again.	Iterum vidi.
it is certain for me.	certum est mihi.
And he did this job.	Et hoc fecit officium.
Not long	Non diu .
I want to buy something.	Volo emere aliquid.
that he did not expect it.	id se non putabat.
There is none in any country.	Nulla in aliquam est.
I'm glad that I do.	Gaudeo quod facio.
he thinks he can get it.	putat se posse accipere.
I have some question.	Habeo aliquam quaestionem.
Today he does the same.	Hodie idem facit.
He had them all before him.	Habuit omnes ante se.
That won't be hard.	Quod non erit difficile.
I think it is something for him.	Puto esse aliquid ad ipsum.
But we can do nothing more.	Sed nihil plus possumus.
But almost nothing.	Sed fere nihil.
He kind of understood.	Qui genus intellexit.
But neither is none at all.	Sed nec nulla.
One name.	Unum nomen.
He understood.	Intellexit.
Don't say anything.	Noli dicere.
Too much to do.	Nimium facere.
But there is nothing that will not be well.	Sed nihil est quod non bene erit.
I just wish it wasn't.	Ut non velit erat.
I was not able to give it yet.	Nondum eam dare non potui.
Today he said nothing.	Hodie nihil dixit.
I know everything here.	Novi huc omnia.
But he loves what was just said.	Sed amat id quod modo dictum est.
This was his name.	Hoc erat nomen eius.
But it is likely for you.	Sed verisimile est pro.
Shortly after.	Multo post.
What he did there.	Quod ibi fecit.
He said he would find you.	Dixit se invenire te.
He was the father.	Pater erat.
He does everything in his own time.	Omnia suo tempore facit.
It's not the time before.	Etiam non tempus ante.
he said to himself.	dixit se.
He didn't want to know that.	Nolebat se scire.
Are you also she.	Esne et illa .
But there is no need for all.	Sed opus non est omnibus.
To take some time.	Ut in aliquam est.
I didn't know if this would be fun.	Si hoc sit amet nesciebam.
He didn't want us.	Noluit nobis.
I hope you are doing well.	Spero te bene agere.
Maybe we don't have time.	Aliquam non tempus habemus.
I don't know how.	Nescio quomodo.
No one can say how long.	Nemo potest dicere quam diu.
I really like it.	Ego vere similis est.
And that could be a very important question.	Posse et ipsum quaestio sit.
I never really had friends.	Numquam vere amicos habuit.
This is not the same.	Hoc non est simile.
But none.	Sed nulla.
In all.	In omnibus.
I know you don't have an affair with me.	Scio te non habere rem mihi.
Not much.	Non multum.
We are to you.	Ad te sumus.
Usually well prepared.	Fere bene paratus.
I wanted to leave alone.	solum relinquere volui.
There is someone here who knows you.	Est aliquis hic, qui te novit.
Nothing is enough.	Nihil satis.
But now you can do something.	Sed nunc aliquid facere potes.
I wonder what could be done.	Miror quid fieri possit.
And there was another.	Aliud autem erat.
I want to go too.	Ire etiam volo.
You will need the same thing.	Idem opus erit.
You know exactly why this is.	Prorsus scis cur hic sit.
Maybe this works very well.	Forsitan hoc opus optime.
This thing he did.	Quae res ita fecit.
You can't do it here.	Hic facere non potes.
No one saw her.	Nemo eam vidit.
It's time to always take some time.	Aliquam semper aliquam aliquam.
Yes that is great.	Etiam id magna est.
I don't see that as bad.	Non ut malum video.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
I am right.	recte sum.
He has not, all things are.	Non habet, omnia sunt.
There is none in him.	Nulla in ipsum nulla.
And you may want to.	Et fortasse vis.
I'm sorry.	Paenitet.
I'll do whatever you want.	Faciam quod vis.
If you've never been one.	Si nunquam unum.
You know when he said he really understood.	Scis cum dixit vere intellexit.
I plan to give.	Cogitavi dare.
This could not have been better than that.	Hoc melius quam fieri non potuit.
The dog did the same.	Idem fecit canis.
But, no.	Sed, nulla.
Don't buy it.	Non emit.
Maybe it's something else.	Forsitan aliud est.
This is not what you want.	Hoc non est quod vis.
Well, I need you.	Bene, mihi et tibi opus est.
None in the said no.	Nulla in dictum nulla.
But before him.	Sed id ipsum ante.
Even when going to school.	Vel ubi ad scholam.
I need something more.	Mihi plus aliquid opus est.
Now you can see through yourself.	Nunc per te ipsum videre potes.
Maybe not out loud.	Aliquam non magna ex.
But when a.	Sed cum a .
he wanted to act.	agere voluit.
Quite a lot.	Satis multum.
just not sure.	Iustus non est certus.
It was something else.	Aliud erat.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I have everything.	Omnia habeo.
I am not getting how to do it.	Non questus quomodo facere.
That's a zero.	Ut a nulla erat.
Tomorrow is your first time.	Cras sit amet tempus quam.
I believe you don't belong to him.	Credo te sibi non esse.
Certainly it was enough.	Certe satis erat.
This cannot be what is seen.	Hoc non potest esse quod videtur.
You are not doing well.	Non bene facis.
Or not much.	Vel non multum.
I will speak in this way.	Dicam hoc modo.
And better now than even a little later.	Et melius nunc quam etiam paulo post.
The first time I see	Primum video.
About me	De me.
I don't want to see him do it.	Non vis videre eum facere.
You need more.	Plus tibi opus est.
I think it's okay.	Puto bene est.
As has not been said.	Ut non dictum est.
Or very early in the morning.	Vel valde mane.
There is a definite need to do it.	Certo opus est facere.
These are so good fun.	Haec tam bona sunt amet.
I'd still be there a little while ago.	Ego vellem adhuc esse quod paulo ante.
You must do this.	Hoc facere debes.
This could have been done already.	Hoc potuit iam.
i want someone.	aliquem volo.
But time is time.	Sed tempus tempus est.
You never said anything to me.	Numquam mihi aliquid dixisti.
He willed.	Voluit.
That it is so.	Quod ita sit.
Or if it is.	Vel si sit.
But he was not.	Sed non erat.
it was better to say that it was never done.	melius fuit dicere numquam factum esse.
which he could do for quite a while.	quod satis diu potuit.
You are not right.	Non recte.
That's when he saw it.	Id cum vidit.
I get my first look at her looking good.	Ego meum primum bonum in vultus vultus eius.
She's trying to do it.	Illa facere conatur.
But not to him.	Sed non ad ipsum.
We can never have again.	Numquam iterum habere possumus.
I just love that.	Ego iustus amo quod.
It was a good decision.	Bonum consilium fuit.
Who doesn't.	Quis non.
He didn't say anything.	Non dixit aliquid.
We are in it.	In illud sumus.
that he would do so soon.	mox se facturum esse.
Now you probably want to see if you need it.	Nunc probabiliter videre vis si opus sit.
That's how important it is.	Ut sit amet quam.
Not that much.	Non quod multum.
I don't talk much.	Non multum loqui.
But now it's not enough.	Sed iam non satis est.
I want to live with her.	una cum illa vivere volo.
Just in the night.	Iustus in nocte.
He did not know where he was.	Nesciebat ubi esset.
At about three in the morning.	Fere mane tres.
I know it's not true.	Scio non esse verum.
Everyone loves something new.	Omnes aliquid novi amat.
What should he do?	Quid faceret?.
It was not enough anymore.	Non satis fuit amplius.
You are here with me.	Hic mecum es.
He never asked me again.	Numquam iterum me quaesivit.
It is also important that he chooses.	Etiam sit amet quam velit.
You are not a boy.	Non puer.
Yes and it is and it is.	Etiam et est et est.
Let's start with that.	Sit amet quam.
He can do nothing.	Nulla facere potest.
Never do that, either.	Nunquam id quidem.
I need to go home.	Mihi opus est ire domum.
It's not so with me.	Non ita est apud me.
In all, it was good to live.	In omnibus, bene vivere erat.
But he did not see.	Sed non vidit.
I don't want to do good.	Nolo facere bonum.
But what is here is good.	Sed quod hic est, bonum est.
For we are not.	Non enim sumus.
He does it all, but it's enough.	Totum facit, sed satis est.
But no one knew.	Sed nemo scivit.
The situation is exactly the same.	Ita prorsus se res habet.
It was about to get some.	Erat ut et aliquam.
I hope to hear something from you.	Spero te aliquid de me audire.
So it was for me.	Sic fuit et me.
You are the only one.	Tu solus es.
He did nothing.	Nihil fecit.
That's where he was now.	Id ubi nunc erat.
No one here speaks to me.	Nemo hic mecum loquitur.
That was great.	Ut magna erat.
So it is.	Ita est.
There was a need to know more about him.	De illo scire opus erat.
It could be three.	Posset esse tres.
Yes there is one.	Etiam unum est.
I'm glad.	Gaudeo.
But that was nothing.	Sed id erat nisi.
We are all things.	Omnia sumus.
It's not okay.	Non est bene.
He does not know yet.	Nescit adhuc.
I was already there.	Iam ibi fui.
We indeed.	Nos quidem.
It cannot be fixed.	Certum esse non potest.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
Nor yet.	Nec tamen.
He knew that he wanted to give him money.	Sciebat se pecuniam ei dare velle.
Maybe very soon.	Mox fortasse ipsum.
And this is exactly the same.	Et hoc prorsus simile est.
Never, never, never.	Numquam, numquam, numquam.
That is true.	Illud est verum.
It is exactly the same as it.	Prorsus idem est cum illo.
Now I don't want it.	Nunc id nolo.
No that was none.	Nulla id nulla erat.
No, not you.	Non, non tu.
he never gave it to her.	numquam ad eam dedit.
As, always, always.	Ut, semper, semper.
Yes that's great as well.	Etiam id magna quam.
But none is better.	Sed melius nulla.
But that's not all.	Sed id non omnes.
That's the whole thing.	Id totum facit.
I told you in the afternoon.	Post meridiem tibi dixi.
Now you have a good time.	Nunc bene habes.
He could do very well.	Optime potuit.
This is easy and quick to do.	Hoc facile est et cito facere.
He wanted to know everything about me.	Omnia de me scire voluit.
It's just not enough.	Tantum non satis est.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum enim.
I have one for sure.	Unum pro certo habeo.
He knew he would win.	Sciebat se vincere.
But at this time no one knew.	Sed hoc tempore nemo scivit.
.	.
But as it is for you.	Sed ut est enim.
You owe her how she wants.	Debes ei quomodo velit.
I heard about him.	Audivi de eo.
I can't do anything for you.	Non possum te facere quicquam.
Now what's happened.	Nunc quid acciderit.
That's not him either.	Ut non ipsum vel.
But he does not.	Sed non facit.
And he knew how to do it better than she.	Sciebat autem melius facere quam illa.
You only see in the near future.	Te solum vide in proximo.
It has been said.	Est dictum.
There is no such thing as none.	Nulla ut nulla enim.
it took me a long time to do it.	id me diu facere posse.
He knew he could not stay longer.	Scivit se diutius manere non posse.
The only way, the only way.	Solum modo, solum modo.
Things are gone.	Res sunt.
But far too soon.	Sed nimis cito.
Certainly he is gone.	Certe abiit.
But I just get better.	Modo ut sed melius.
I was in everything.	fui in omnibus.
It was true.	Verum erat.
perhaps better in that way.	melius fortasse illo modo.
But now it was him.	Nunc sed ipsum erat.
I see this for the first time now.	hoc nunc primum video.
Too busy, you know.	Occupatus, scis.
He is speaking of this.	De hoc loquitur.
He thought he was playing for a while.	Putabat se ludere per tempus.
I'm not anything.	Non sum quicquam.
But he was not.	Sed non est erat.
It's time to get some out of it.	Aliquam non aliquam ex.
So we're out there.	Sic ex ibi sumus.
To get some out of it.	Ut id aliquam ex.
That's what I've always done.	Id semper feci.
He has not.	Non habet.
I knew for sure.	Sciebam certe.
I believe that he is.	Eum esse credo.
I thought you were still alive.	Putavi adhuc te esse.
But that's how it is.	Sed id ipsum quam.
He wanted to hear it.	Audire eam voluit.
I didn't know what to do with someone else.	Ego nesciebam quid cum aliquo facerem.
They do it often.	Et facere saepe.
That can be good.	Quod bonum esse potest.
It was a really great morning.	Vere mane magna erat.
It's not okay.	Non bene est.
Certainly he could not do it if this were not true.	Facere certe non potuit si hoc verum non esset.
That was gonna be something for him.	Ille erat amet aliquid ei.
I'm sorry, you can't get this one.	Paenitet, hoc unum habere non potes.
That's none of the game either.	Ut vel ipsum nulla.
He never knew what it was that was after him.	Quid esset, quod post se esset, numquam sciebat.
He is a good boy.	Bonus puer est.
But that's no problem.	Sed nulla quaestio id.
But it is something more.	Sed plus aliquid est.
Your time is now.	Tempus tuum nunc est.
Everything as well.	Omnia sicut bene.
He didn't want anything to do with him.	Noluit aliquid facere cum eo.
And he has.	Et habet.
And perhaps it is.	Et fortasse est.
It's time to ask yourself.	Aliquam a ipsum.
This seems unlikely.	Hoc probabile videtur.
I couldn't take it anymore.	Non potui amplius eam accipere.
Now is the time to talk to each other.	Nunc tempus est inter se loqui.
never was, never will be.	numquam fuit, numquam erit.
I hope that's true.	Spero quod verum est.
You have always.	Semper habes.
No one knows but me.	Nemo scit ibi esse nisi me.
But I know that there is yet another name here.	Sed scio adhuc hic aliud nomen esse.
It was his time.	Eius nunc erat.
Maybe he is too.	Fortasse ipse quoque.
You know it to be.	Scis eam esse.
And I was hard.	Et eram difficile.
Not that it's the best.	Nec id optime est.
At least that's the whole thing.	Id certe totum.
She said.	Illa dixit .
He was always willing.	Semper erat velit.
It is true, indeed.	Verum est, vere.
He was just not a good man.	Iustus non erat vir bonus.
Look at him well.	Me vide in eum bene.
It will not be hard to find.	Non sit difficile invenire.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
On that day	Illo die.
I will always tell you what to do.	Dicam tibi semper quid facias.
It was not that bad.	Non erat id malum.
There is none in him.	Nulla in ipsum est.
after her.	post eam.
It seems to be true.	Verum videtur.
But no one seems to have done this.	Sed id fecisse nemo videtur.
It should be used for.	Debet esse pro.
I hope to see how happy you are.	Spero te videre quam felix sis.
And so that.	Et ut.
No one thought himself, but did.	Nemo putabat se, sed fecit.
He likes it.	Velit eam.
My father wanted me to go to him.	Pater meus me in ipsum ire voluit.
He can say what he wants.	Dicere potest quid velit.
For what could be wrong.	Quid enim mali potuit.
He seems to be doing fine.	Bene facere videtur.
But you must not do this.	Sed hoc facere non debes.
When is your first time.	Cum primum sit amet.
You don't know how to go through it.	Per eam ire non scis.
and there is nothing better to do.	et nihil melius facere.
If he is not at home, you need to find him.	Si domi non est, eum invenire debes.
Yes, he was always there.	Etiam in semper erat.
If not, it was.	Nisi, erat.
What is great.	Quid sit magna.
We can't be.	Fieri non possumus.
He could not give him his job.	Officium suum ei dare non potuit.
I need you to stay here.	Te hic manere debeo.
He ought to act and act of himself.	Agere et agere per se debet.
But that's no right now.	Sed id nulla nunc.
He did not.	Non fecit.
It was more than just a question.	Plus quam quaestio fuit.
Enough is enough.	Satis satis est.
Not him, but.	Non eum, sed.
He had much more than he wanted to say.	Multo plus habuit qui dicere voluit.
I would like to see it.	Vellem videre eam.
and he saw good.	et vidit bonum.
It's easy enough.	Satis facile est.
He is his father.	Pater suus est.
Well, so much good.	Bene, quantum bonum.
It's another race today.	Est hodie aliud genus.
He could not give it now.	Non potuit nunc dare.
this does not occur to me.	id mihi non occurrit.
I couldn't even barely speak.	Ne vix quidem loqui potui.
Now it seems to be working.	Nunc enim opus esse videtur.
Comes in A	Venit in A.
But he did not know.	Sed non sciebat.
him or himself.	Ipsum vel ipsum.
He was there to think about it.	Fuit et ipse de eo cogitare.
but only today.	sed solum hodie.
Certainly I am.	Certe ego.
This was quickly done.	Hoc cito factum est.
Was this done there? 	Hoc ibi factum est?
and it seems	et videtur.
But not what he says.	Sed non id quod dicit.
I hope you look pretty.	Spero autem quod satis vide.
Yes but always yourself.	Etiam sed semper ipsum.
Not how he wanted to go tonight.	Non quomodo hac nocte ire voluit.
I don't regret it.	Non paenitet.
There is no evidence of any kind.	Nulla id aliquam ex.
perhaps it is.	fortasse est.
Certainly it was not for me.	Mihi certe non fuit.
Maybe not.	Aliquam non.
But all these a.	Sed haec omnia a.
Again possible, but not likely.	Iterum fieri potest, sed non verisimile.
Nothing has been done.	Nihil factum est.
But well there.	Sed bene ibi.
The same is true enough.	Idem verum satis est.
It's hard to tell right now.	Difficile est iam narrare.
It's only good or bad.	Est modo bonum vel malum.
I want to know who knows.	Scire volo qui scivit.
Really, really appreciate your time.	Vere, vere bene tempus tuum.
The whole thing was just that.	Totum illud solum erat.
We are barely enough for us.	Vix satis nobis sumus.
No, I know, not really.	Non est, scio, non vere.
And they are.	Et sunt.
It is all right.	Recte est.
Take me there.	Ibi me accipere.
I don't care anymore.	Nolo amplius.
I am definitely one to be.	Certus sum unus esse.
I didn't need to believe it.	Mihi necesse non fuit credere.
He did the same thing.	Ita res fecerit.
And certainly you can't go on like this.	Et certe sic ire non potes.
Perhaps he would not.	Noluit fortasse.
But not from him.	Sed non ipsum ex.
.	.
It is certain that we can.	Certum est quod possumus.
He certainly was not doing this.	Hoc certe facere non erat.
This is your time.	Hoc tempus tibi est.
Yes it is with me.	Ita est apud me.
Maybe not now.	Aliquam non nunc.
It was a great story.	Aliquam a erat magna.
Not yours either.	Nec tua vel.
That was it.	Id erat.
said it never happened.	dixit nunquam factum.
I believe you know.	Scire credo.
I know him.	Novi ipsum.
I could think again.	Iterum cogitare potui.
But really there is none.	Sed vere nulla est.
He could not come and go as he wanted.	Non potuit venire et ire sicut voluit.
we need to travel.	iter nobis opus est.
It is a good thing.	Bona res est.
Not great, but still great.	Non magna, sed multa tamen.
Play video.	Ludere video.
It's a good question, though.	Bonum est quaestio, sed.
These are good.	Haec sunt bona.
I do not know.	Nescio.
We had no problem with that.	Nobis nihil quaestio cum id.
I don't know anything else about it.	Nescio quid aliud de eo.
you cannot	non potes .
I think I need to do this right now.	Hoc nunc facere puto opus.
And in him.	Et in eo.
Or perhaps not.	Vel fortasse non.
He said that he was, but barely.	Dixit se esse, sed vix.
But you know when he is there, and when he is not.	Tu tamen scis quando ibi est, et quando non est.
That's the job.	Id est officium.
Stay here with us.	Mane hic nobiscum.
I just listen to her.	Modo audire ad eam.
This is to help.	Hic est ut adiuvet.
There either	Ibi vel .
Well well	Bene bene .
He could do it today if he wanted to.	Potuit hodie facere, si vellet.
But it was not before.	Sed non erat ante.
I really love you, you know.	Ego vere amo, tu scis.
Because he wanted to stay like this.	Quod non voluit sic manere.
I'll never say it.	Dicam numquam.
as required.	Quod erat faciendum.
got on the road.	Obtinuit iter.
Boy .	Puer .
Not at the time.	Non eo tempore.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
No it is not.	Nulla non est.
I will tell him.	Dicam ei.
I saw him.	Vidi eum.
He could not do enough.	Satis facere non potuit.
This does not surprise me.	Hoc non miror.
Its always zero.	Eius semper nulla.
That makes us friends.	Quod nos amicos facit.
You live in everything.	Vos vivere in omnibus.
I hope he is doing well.	Spero, bene facit.
there! 	ibi!
there! 	ibi!
He did not	Non fecit .
Always be honest.	Semper sit amet.
But here there is none.	Sed hic nulla.
Pretty much mine so much.	Satis multa mea tantum.
I never do it on time.	Numquam id faciam in tempore.
Well, you're fine.	Bene, bene es.
Now it's me.	Nunc mihi est.
but you know about him.	sed scis de illo.
He would not hear this.	Hoc audire noluit.
Now I need to know why.	Nunc opus est scire quare.
He didn't understand it either.	Vel ad rem non intellexit.
But you know her.	Sed scis eius.
I was with him.	una cum eo fui.
This is the same.	Hoc ipsum est.
No one can do this.	Hoc facere nemo potest.
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
For him, as he said something, he made it true.	Pro eo, sicut dixit aliquid, verum fecit.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
And time is enough.	Et satis est tempus.
Don't think, don't.	Noli cogitare, noli.
With him on the day	Cum eo die.
But that's nothing but.	Sed id nihil nisi.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est verum.
I hope to see you soon.	Spero te cito.
Will be home tomorrow.	Cras domi erit.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
It's not going to happen.	Non futurum est.
Now she did it.	Nunc id fecit.
All things for all.	Omnia pro omnibus.
and your name.	et nomen tuum.
What you want.	Quod vis.
Not even that ever.	Ne id quidem umquam.
Who was the same.	Etiam quis erat ipsum.
No, it is not.	Non, non est.
There was something about it.	Aliquid de fuit.
I don't need to act so late.	Non tam sero agere debeo.
And he would not, either.	Et nolebat, vel.
yes or from ex.	Etiam vel ex ex.
If you don't like it, it's also bad.	Si tibi non placet, etiam malum est.
That's what it is all about.	Id quod omnibus est.
It doesn't mean you shouldn't buy your house.	Non vult tibi domum emere non debes.
Tomorrow is coming well.	Cras bene venit.
But what.	Sed quid.
I can truly believe this.	Hoc vere possum credere.
He is totally human.	Prorsus est homo.
He can't get this.	Hoc habere non potest.
This thing is the thing.	Hic rem sit rem.
He is not here.	Hic, non est.
It is important that you love yourself.	Aliquam sit amet quam ipsum.
I'm not sure how.	Non sum certus quomodo.
It was better for me to take her home.	Melius mihi erat ut eam domum.
I'll tell you what it was for me.	Dicam quid esset mihi.
Never let it be.	Numquam sit.
This was not going to happen as always.	Hoc non erat futurum, ut semper.
If he said yes, it is.	Si dixit sic, sic est.
It was the first time she was with anyone.	Is cum quis primum eam fuisse.
You can see it here.	Hic videre potes.
I could not speak.	Dicere non potui.
But if you cannot do it, you cannot come.	Sed si non potes facere, et venire non potes.
He does not know when, but knows the future.	Nescit quando, sed scit futurum.
Well, but me everything.	Bene, sed me omnia.
But the story was told.	Aliquam sed dictum erat.
He asked exactly why.	Prorsus quaesivit cur.
The Father is like us.	Pater nobis similis est.
For he does not want it to be done.	Non enim vult fieri.
It's fine with me.	Bene est mecum.
If that's true.	Si id quidem.
I could travel easily.	Facile iter potui.
Maybe not right.	Fortasse non recte.
Now I can see.	Nunc videre possum.
I am the only one person.	unus solus ego sum homo.
That alone is enough.	Quod solum satis est.
Now it is not.	Iam non est.
But now is the time.	Nunc sed tempus est.
He did not do this.	Hoc non fecit.
But the story was told.	Aliquam sed dictum erat.
Yes that is before.	Etiam id est ante.
But you do this one thing.	Sed tu id unum facis.
Breakfast is good.	Prandium bonum est.
He did it.	Fecit id.
Probably so.	Verisimiliter ut.
I can totally.	Prorsus possum.
It's me.	Is mihi est.
But that's nothing.	Sed id nihil.
It could be a journey.	Posset esse iter.
For you know me.	Scis enim me.
Why couldn't it be mine.	Quare non potuit mea esse.
I love you.	Amo te.
That's how you know.	Id quam scis.
But that was how.	Sed id erat quam.
This is never happy.	Hoc est nunquam felix.
I never saw him again.	Numquam vidi in eo iterum esse.
I know why.	Scio cur.
It should be done today.	Hodie fieri debet.
We are not doing anything like this.	Non sumus facere aliquid simile hoc.
I never really do this at the time.	Numquam rem facere tempore.
he has not yet.	nondum habet.
It is necessary to go south.	Meridiem ire necesse est.
This man was aware of everything.	Hic vir et quae sciebat.
Thus we have .	Sic habemus .
In as much as he wants.	In ut velit quam.
He wanted to know who he was.	Scire voluit quis esset.
There he could not find us.	Ibi nos invenire non potuit.
We would definitely see someone.	Certum esset aliquem videre nos.
In this way it could not be true.	Hoc modo verum esse non potuit.
Nothing is there for me to play with.	Nihil est mihi cum ludere.
He is not the kind of guy.	Is non est genus guy.
I just don't want to.	Ut non velit.
Certainly it was for me.	Mihi certe fuit.
The teacher was there.	Ibi magister fuit.
you have what is with you.	habes quod apud te est.
Not that much.	Non quod multum.
I need it for sure.	Certum mihi opus est.
He didn't want to talk much.	Noluit multum loqui.
Usually this should be good.	Fere hoc bonum esse debet.
I have a job.	Habeo officium.
All that which he has cannot have.	Totum id quod habet non potest habere.
This is more than that.	Plus hic est quam illa.
But it does not have to be with you.	Sed tecum esse non habet.
Or at least he thought so.	Vel certe ita putavit.
But it is difficult to say anything.	Sed difficile est aliquid dicere.
It's hard to believe she's not here.	Difficile est credere illa hic non est.
Some great things.	Aliquam magna.
Just play hard.	Iustus ludere difficile.
He understood everything.	Intellexit omnia.
There is no need to persuade him anything.	Non opus est ei aliquid persuadere.
Now it is not true.	Verum iam non est.
It was something I always thought for sure.	Aliquis certe erat quod semper putavit.
It looks good.	Bonum videtur.
This was not the point.	Non hoc fuit illud.
And perhaps well.	Et fortasse bene.
Not great, but not either.	Non magna, sed nec vel.
That's where the man was.	Quod ibi vir suus erat.
He does also.	Facit etiam.
I'm not sure what you mean.	Non sum certus quid sit.
I just can't hear you.	Modo me audire possum.
But that is how.	Sed id est quam.
If it truly was, then it is.	Si vere fuit, iam est.
That he himself.	Quod ipse.
I don't know where the problem was.	Nescio ubi quaestio esset.
But you just don't do it.	Sed tu tantum ne feceris.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
What to do?.	Quid facere?.
He'll be home soon enough.	Satis diu et cito domi erit.
Not even in this way.	Ne hoc quidem modo.
yes i've never been out.	Etiam ut numquam ex.
All you need is	Omnes opus est.
This is not to be.	Hoc non esse.
You don't always do it as soon as possible.	Non semper quam primum facis.
there was only one.	una tantum fuit.
As much as he wants.	Ut ut velit.
Do something there.	Fac aliquid ibi.
Before doing the best.	Ante optime facit.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
Not long yet.	Non diu tamen.
It's almost a lot.	Multum fere est.
I have with you.	Habeo apud te.
She often said to him that there was nothing to talk about.	Illa saepe dixit ei nihil esse quod loqui.
But in whom.	Sed in quam quam.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
There is no such thing as that.	Nulla id ipsum enim.
You are not right.	Non recte.
No one really knows what will happen.	Nemo vere scit quid futurum sit.
And say	Et dic.
it is not certain.	certum non est.
I am busy now.	Nunc mihi es occupatus.
I could not find anything true.	Non potui invenire aliquid verum.
I told him many things.	multa ei dixi.
But not in the way that you're probably thinking.	Sed non eo modo quo tu probabiliter cogitas.
And this was done.	Quod et factum est.
That which has yet to be done, no one has known.	Quod adhuc factum est, nemo scivit.
They are truly.	Sunt vere.
But neither was he himself.	Sed nec ipsum erat.
what do you want from me.	quid a me vis facere.
But this is not enough.	Sed hoc non est satis.
That's what he said.	Id dixit.
All here are mine.	Omnia hic mea sunt.
Here, he could not tell.	Hic, modo nescire potuit.
He wanted to hear me.	Audire me voluit.
I could not believe it.	Credere non potui.
It is .	Est .
He cannot see.	Videre non potest.
Yes this has been said.	Etiam id dictum est.
Do what you like, but not it.	Fac quod libet, sed non illud.
Someone has left you here.	Aliquis hic te reliquit.
Make it easy for your family.	Fac ut facile genus tuum.
It was never and never will be.	Numquam fuit et numquam erit.
And soon it will be.	Et mox erit.
It is not bad.	Non malum.
Not much.	Non multum.
Everything he said correctly.	Omnia dixit recte.
He speaks to me all along.	Me per totum loquitur.
We just think about getting here.	Iustus cogitare de nobis hic questus.
We don't have too much time.	Nimium tempus non habemus.
I don't believe so.	Non ita me credo.
but he knew he really wanted the job.	sed sciebat se vere velle officium.
So he saw me.	Ita me vidit.
He seems to be a good man.	Bonus vir esse videtur.
I told him not.	Non ei dixi.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
I can't believe he will do it again.	Non possum credere id iterum facturum esse.
It will not be hard to find.	Non sit difficile invenire.
I want to understand this.	Hoc intelligere volo.
And you're too soon.	Et nimis cito es.
For you.	Pro vobis.
I could not see her anymore.	Non potui amplius eam videre.
That one is pretty good.	Ille unus satis bene.
And you a .	Et tu a .
No no no.	Nulla non nulla.
I'm not sure what to do.	Quod facere non certus sum.
I am not a father.	Pater non sum.
It just wasn't right.	Is iustus non recte.
You and yourself.	Te et ipsum.
It's pretty good.	Satis bonus est.
He told me that it was good for me.	Dixit mihi bonum esse meum.
It is important that you have none.	Aliquam sit amet quam te nulla.
But that very thing was not always said.	Sed id ipsum non erat semper dictum.
I think this is so true.	Hoc ita verum puto.
Many .	Multum .
This man did so.	Hic sic fecit.
There is no time for it.	Nulla id tempus ipsum.
I'd like to do something too.	Libet etiam aliquid facere.
Actually I do.	Vere facio.
Maybe too much.	Forte nimium.
No, better than that.	Non, melius quam.
I don't know your name, I don't want to.	Nomen tuum nescio, non vis.
Not here.	Non hic.
Well, he seems to have it now.	Bene, hoc nunc habere videtur.
In this way.	Hic modo.
I don't want it anymore.	Nolo sic amplius.
i didn't think.	non putavi.
Maybe that's been said before.	Aliquam id dictum ante.
This is probable.	Hoc autem probabile.
This could not have been done.	Hoc fieri non potuit.
That says a lot.	Quod multum dicit.
If you don't have a date, it's fine.	Si diem non habes, bene est.
I haven't thought about that for a long time.	Non cogitavi ut diu.
He was always here.	Hic semper erat.
This he said: I knew you.	Hoc dixit: Sciebam te.
I can still have more.	Non possum adhuc amplius habere.
I don't agree with him either.	Non cum ipsum vel.
But not before.	Sed non ante.
never left it.	Numquam reliquit eam.
No one does it.	Nemo ex eo agit.
I will only say this.	Hoc tantum dicam.
He just didn't have much to say.	Multum ille iustus non habuit dicere.
But that's no time.	Sed id tempus nulla.
But that's not going to happen.	Id autem non futurum est.
There was something there.	Aliquid ibi fuit.
It probably was.	Probabile fuit.
For a long time you know.	Diu scis.
Don't like me.	Non amo me.
It was through a lot of things.	Per multum fuit.
I don't know what to say to you.	Quid tibi dicam nescio.
That makes it fun.	Id facit ut amet.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
This has already started.	Hoc jam incepit.
He willed.	Voluit.
He didn't want to give up easily.	Noluit facile dare.
Maybe better.	Melius fortasse.
But it is not seen.	Sed non videtur.
But not bad.	Sed non male.
And it is.	Et est.
That name, he eats.	Nomen illud, ille comedit.
Nothing now.	Nihil nunc.
There is something in me.	Sit aliquid in me.
And it is still today.	Et adhuc hodie est.
I don't need you.	Et non opus est tibi.
But not before.	Sed non ante quam.
But he is not here.	Sed hic non est.
Always, always, always.	Semper, semper, semper.
Say what you like.	Dic quid simile.
I thought that was it.	Putabam id erat.
That's definitely a lot.	Quod multum certum est.
As always.	Quam semper.
It is always.	Semper est.
Police have not said.	Aliquam non dictum est.
If necessary.	Si necesse sit.
But he doesn't even concern me.	Sed ne me quidem spectat.
He could do everything with her.	Omnia cum illa potuit.
Do whatever work could be done, play.	Fac quod opus fieri posset, ludere.
Maybe it's too soon for me.	Forsitan cito mihi est.
It was during lunch.	Inter prandium fuit.
Perhaps he could not understand me.	Forsitan me intelligere non potuit.
No not great.	Nulla non magna.
She asked me to go first.	Rogavit me primum ire.
I want to do this work.	Hoc opus facere volo.
And indeed we can.	Et quidem possumus.
I am from this truth.	Ego sum ex hoc verum est.
I am getting there.	Ibi sum questus.
I was almost ready.	Fere paratus eram.
Yesterday was a day.	Heri erat dies.
Well, no matter.	Bene, nulla res.
I did not see you coming.	Non vidi te venire.
Someone could talk with you.	Aliquis cum loqui posset.
I'm here a lot.	Hic multum sum.
I don't feel this way right now.	Sic nunc non sentio.
There was always a zero.	Nulla a semper erat.
This is my job to do.	Hoc est officium facere.
It's not his job.	Non suum opus.
Yep, this is it.	Vidi, hic est.
But he does not think about me.	Sed de me non cogitat.
That's a bad thing.	Id, malum.
At home too.	Domi quoque.
All things are mine.	Omnia enim mea.
That's what they are.	Id sunt.
He could not.	Non potuit.
She's already talking about me.	Iam illa de me loquitur.
I can do a lot.	Multum possum.
he knows better.	melius novit.
But still great.	Sed adhuc magna.
That's it here.	Id hic.
Maybe it was time.	Aliquam id tempus erat.
i wanted it.	volui eam.
He wants to speak for me.	Pro me loqui vult.
May both of you be well.	Et bene tibi sit utrumque.
Which is the case.	Quod ita se habet.
She will be here.	Illa hic erit.
I don't know exactly.	Nescio prorsus.
which I could do well.	quod bene facere potui.
I feel certain	Certum sentio .
That was for us.	Id nobis erat.
The man is like.	Vir, similis.
Play there for one week.	Ludere ibi una septimana.
and this morning	et hoc mane.
You can have something better.	Melius aliquid habere potes.
No way or none at all.	Nulla vel modo nulla.
He never thought it could be done.	Fieri posse nunquam putabat.
Yes that's the same for you.	Etiam id ipsum pro.
Better but not right.	Melius tamen non recte.
But he's willing to do something about that.	Sed hic velit aliquid ut.
but they are always men.	sed semper homines sunt.
But it is not necessary for all.	Sed non omnibus necesse est.
He did not do this.	Hoc non fecit.
That is.	Id est.
Well, no more.	Bene, non amplius.
But look at the matter.	Sed vide rem.
Maybe it was or was.	Aliquam vel erat erat.
He did it for you.	Fecit tibi.
But now we can talk if you want.	Sed nunc loqui possumus si vis.
She seems to see nothing else.	Illa nihil aliud videre videtur.
So I feel really happy.	Ita sentio vere felix.
More here, man.	Plus hic, homo.
Don't ever say where you are from.	Noli umquam dicere ubi a te sis.
And evil.	Et malum.
My dad really wants me to go.	Pater meus me ire vere vult.
He wants to go home.	Domum ire non vult.
You can't do this.	Hoc facere non potes.
I need to talk to someone about it.	Mihi opus est de eo loqui ad aliquem.
He never does anything.	Aliquid numquam facit.
I think you can't go.	Puto non ire.
Maybe you'd better go without me.	Forsitan melius sine me ire velis.
It's late now.	Nunc sero est.
I am sure.	Certus sum ego.
That is, he is a teacher.	Hoc est, magister est.
Let's start with the season.	Sit amet tempus et.
yes no always no.	Etiam non semper nulla.
There is nothing wrong with it either.	Nihil per se mali est vel.
He does not come.	Non venit.
I need it tonight.	Ut hac nocte opus sit.
It was the same for me.	Idem mihi fuit.
I don't like this too.	Hoc quoque non placet.
Can't wait.	Manere non potest.
We can't say enough about this.	Non possumus de hoc satis dicere.
He could not be.	Non potuit eum esse.
You can do whatever you want.	Facere potes quod vis.
I don't even know.	Me ne quidem novit.
There it was.	Ibi fuit.
I will tell you.	Dicam tibi.
But that's probably why.	Sed id probabiliter quare.
Too busy for you.	Nimis occupatus est.
No one asked about me.	Nemo de me quaesivit.
That's exactly yesterday.	Heri id prorsus.
It was just hard to see.	Sicut erat difficile ad.
Saying something is one thing to believe.	Aliud est dicere aliquid credere.
That's what it always was.	Ut id semper erat.
It is not yet certain.	Non tamen certum est.
And you need it too.	Debes etiam et.
Maybe that was some.	Aliquam id aliquam erat.
I am surprised by this description.	Miror hoc genus.
You probably already know how hard it was.	Probabiliter iam scis quam difficile esset.
No statement now.	Nulla dictum nunc.
Hardly too easy.	Facile etiam vix.
He did not know where he was.	Nesciebat ubi esset.
This is my plan today.	Hoc consilium meum hodie est.
.	.
None in none.	Nulla in nulla nulla.
I need to act.	Mihi opus est agere.
May be as before.	Sit ut ante.
I never asked anything about it.	Numquam me aliquid de eo quaesivit.
truly, truly.	vere, vere.
It probably had.	Probabile habuit.
That's not how it was.	Ut non quam erat.
You know how to do this.	Scis quomodo hoc facias.
Nothing to it.	Nihil ad eam.
Something better either.	Aliquid melius vel.
And this is.	Et hoc est.
I'm not sure what she wants.	Non sum certus quid sibi velit.
But something must be done.	Aliquid autem faciendum est.
I have nothing to do.	Non habeo quod facere.
That's when you want to be better.	Id quando melius vis.
Where he did not say.	Ubi non dixit.
He does not know how to act.	Nescit quomodo se agere.
I will not speak anymore.	Non dicam amplius.
I know you're there.	Scio te ibi esse.
There is nothing wrong.	Nihil mali est.
I know I am.	Scio ego.
He didn't want me to say more than that.	Noluit mihi amplius dicere quam illud.
he did it too.	fecit etiam.
I don't talk anymore.	Non loqui amplius.
It has to be here.	Habet hic esse.
He is a man.	Vir est.
Everything is going great.	Omnia magna eat.
There is a lot to love here.	Est ut amet hic amet.
Never buy one.	Numquam emere unum.
Afternoon not well.	Post meridiem non bene.
We have that and that.	Id habemus et id .
Do you think you are there.	Putasne ibi.
I was able to do this work.	Hoc opus facere potui.
And often with him.	Autem saepe cum illum.
It is not to do his own evil.	Non est malum suum agere.
It was scarce, it certainly was.	Vix erat, id certe erat.
It is the same with all.	Simile est cum omnibus.
But tell me.	Sed dic mihi.
Certainly, but not so you will.	Certe, sed non ita vis.
He's going to do it.	Facturum est.
Looks like a good plan.	Bonum consilium similis.
They are not good for you.	Non sunt tibi bona.
What was said is important.	Quod dictum sit amet.
Maybe it won't.	Fortasse non erit.
i need to see his name.	opus est mihi videre nomen suum.
and this I love.	et hoc amo.
This he did more.	Hoc plus fecit.
I tried to stay with her.	Conatus sum ipsum manere cum proximo suo.
It's all about us together.	Est de nobis omnibus simul.
It is not necessary to do this.	Hoc facere non est necesse.
But that's not fun.	Sed id non amet.
Yes that is good.	Ita quod est bonum.
Maybe it was great.	Aliquam erat magna.
Be friends with who you want to be friends with.	Esse amicos, qui vis esse amicos.
Who is she? 	Quis est illa?
.	.
He was always there.	Semper erat.
I know you have to do this.	Scio te hoc facere.
Better when you eat.	Melius cum comedit.
Maybe you were right.	Forsitan recte.
There was nothing.	Nihil erat.
Do this for yourself.	Hoc tibi fac.
whether he could speak to me.	an dicere mihi potuit.
I want to hear.	Audire volo.
But this is not possible.	Sed hoc fieri non potest.
You didn't say what it was.	Non dixisti quid esset.
Something's going to happen soon.	Aliquid mox futurum.
It's hard to see why.	Difficile est cur.
But what he said of me was not true.	Sed id quod de me dixit, verum non fuit.
This is above all.	Hoc ante omnia.
He knew all this.	Hoc totum sciebat.
He would not hear this.	Hoc audire noluit.
It is true, yes.	Verum est, Etiam.
He never left us.	Numquam nobis reliquit.
He is ready.	Paratus est.
I love it all, too.	Omnes eam amo, etiam.
He said not much.	Non multa dixit.
But he was also himself.	Sed et ipsum erat.
It's not always good.	Non semper est bonum.
But he says nothing.	Sed nihil dicit.
It was very good.	Erat valde bona.
That was too easy.	Quod nimis facile fuit.
I think that this could be done.	id fieri posse puto.
Not for himself, but for me.	Non sibi, sed mihi.
We have one plan before us.	Unum consilium habemus ante nos.
But not in him.	Sed non in ipsum.
This is what is possible.	Hoc est quod fieri potest.
I don't need it again.	Non opus est iterum.
You are just.	Iustus es.
I did this alone.	Hoc solum feci.
Maybe that's not great.	Aliquam id nisi magna.
I don't need anymore.	Non opus est amplius.
You will probably be lucky enough.	Satis probabiliter et felix esse.
What else was	Quid aliud esset.
Now but no.	Nunc sed nulla.
Never since.	Numquam ex quo.
Well, well, well.	Bene bene, bene est.
Actually, I really want to live here.	Vere, vere hic vivere volo.
You have everything to tell me.	Omnia mihi narrare habes .
We've been here for too long.	Hic nimium diu sumus.
But you never know.	Sed numquam scis.
There was none in any.	Nulla in aliquam erat.
could still do so.	adhuc facere potuit.
I just need someone to talk to.	Ego iustus opus aliquis loqui.
Maybe not at all.	Aliquam non nulla.
But he knew what to hear.	Sciebat sed audire.
No one did anything.	Nemo aliquid fecit.
If not this year, maybe next.	Si non hoc anno, fortasse proximo.
This thing is.	Haec res est.
He also did this.	Hoc etiam fecit.
Maybe she could talk to him.	Forsitan ei loqui posset.
It is not for me.	Non est mihi.
There was no problem.	Nulla quaestio erat.
And yet you do well.	Et tamen bene facis.
Take a look at this.	Vide hoc, ut.
He had no idea what he wanted from her.	Quid ab illa vellet nesciebat.
If he is there, you're fine.	Si ibi est, bene es.
We are on time.	Nos ex tempore sumus.
I really like talking to you.	Ego vere amo loquitur tecum.
Talk about what you want.	Loqui vis.
Let me say something about it.	Dicam aliquid de eo.
Anger! 	Ire!
more if you want.	plus est, si vis.
You may well know why.	Bene scire potes quare.
There is something there that we all need to know.	Est aliquid ibi, quod nos omnes scire necesse est.
I don't want her money.	Pecuniam eius nolo.
Who was it now.	Qui modo erat.
This would be the first time.	Hoc primum esset.
I heard you speak of.	Audivi loqui de te.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
My husband is gone.	Vir meus abiit.
I said so much to him.	Tantum ei dixi.
I am sure of you.	Certus sum de te.
It was not some story.	Aliquam non aliquam erat.
I'm afraid so much.	Tantum vereor.
I looked like you too.	Vidi sicut tu quoque.
But you can say what you want.	Sed quid vis dicere potes.
That it can be good or bad.	Quod bonum vel malum esse possit.
he could not know.	scire potuit.
In order.	In ut.
Which seems to be true.	Quod verum esse videtur.
This is pretty good.	Hoc satis bonum est.
He's just	Ille iustus .
That it is.	Quod sit.
often do so.	Saepe id.
Yes, it wasn't always.	Etiam non semper erat.
It really is not.	Is vere non est.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I am not evil.	Malum non sum.
But it is difficult for him to be with us.	Sed difficile est eum esse nobiscum.
World of Warcraft is now.	Etiam tempus nunc enim.
I know that I can do it.	scio id facere posse.
You know what's happened.	Scis quid acciderit.
Not all.	Non omnes.
No time is available.	Nulla sit amet tempus est.
I know what to do.	Scio quid faciam.
So you don't.	Ita non facis.
He wanted to say everything at the same time.	Omnia simul dicere voluit.
To-morrow in the wish for.	Cras in velit enim.
Now that was the time.	Nunc id tempus erat.
He never came home.	Numquam domum venit.
That which was not done.	Quod factum non est.
I think the book is true.	Librum verum puto.
She said nothing wrong.	Illa nihil mali dixit.
He did not do this.	Hoc non faceret.
and he wanted it to be.	et esse voluit.
I can't say why.	Non possum dicere quare.
I know rightly.	Recte scio.
i thought he was.	Putabam erat.
From that time he has been with me.	Ex eo tempore et me ipsum fuit.
There is something there.	Est aliquid ibi.
It's too soon, now.	Mox nimis est, nunc.
But that is different.	Sed id aliud est.
You can never win.	Numquam vincere potes.
Looks like that.	Vultus similis est.
.	.
That's what he wants.	Id velit.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
No one really knows for sure.	Nemo vere scit pro certo.
Tell me where it is.	Dic ubi sit.
i have something to say.	habeo aliquid dicere.
Well, this is definitely her.	Bene, hic certus est eius.
Not just to do it.	Non solum id facere.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
They are always together.	Semper sunt simul.
This he says what it is.	Hoc dicit quid sit.
Now do something before.	Nunc aliquid ante.
And there I stay, there alone.	Et ibi me manere, ibi solus.
It is with us as people.	Ita est nobiscum sicut homines.
This is a lot better.	Hoc multum melius est.
Too hard for you.	Nimis difficile est tibi.
But it is too much.	Sed nimis est.
But this is so per se.	Sed hoc per se ita est.
He knew he had nothing to say.	Scivit se nihil dicere.
It was a good thing to do.	Erat bene facere.
But what if he did not?	Sed quid si non fecit .
He is not likely to talk about it.	Verisimile non est de eo loqui.
Nothing I think as much as you can.	Nihil puto quantum potes.
for what is wrong.	Quid enim mali est.
On this night.	Hac nocte.
He could not do this now.	Hoc nunc facere non potuit.
Trying to believe in.	Conatur in.
yes it is time.	Etiam tempus est.
He did not say why.	Non dixit quare.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
He said to me badly.	Ipse mihi male dixit.
And perhaps there is nothing there at all.	Et fortasse nihil ibi omnino.
Not right, see.	Non recte, vide.
This is evil.	Hic malum est.
He refused to think or speak.	Noluit cogitare vel loqui.
He knew he would not.	Noluit scivit.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
You need to know what you want.	Hoc scire debes, quod vis.
But that is not.	Sed id non est.
It was great to do.	Multum facere.
And never do it.	Nec id numquam.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
There is no plan.	Non est consilium.
But I am one person.	Ego autem sum unus homo.
Which is so.	Quod ita est.
But now it's enough.	Sed iam satis est.
I want to have you.	Volo te habere.
I do something wrong.	Aliquid mali facio.
Its almost like now.	Eius fere similis nunc.
She thought it was, but could not be sure.	Putavit eam esse sed certo non potuit.
She's got what she wanted.	Illa obtinuit quod voluit.
I really want to know.	Ego vere volo scire.
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
I heard enough.	Satis audivi.
I don't think that's true.	Quod non verum puto.
I didn't come for lunch.	Non venit ad prandium.
Same thing today.	Idem hodie.
And not my father.	Nec pater.
But you do.	Tu tamen fac.
it must be forgotten.	Oblitus esse debet.
No, it's not right.	Non, non recte est.
Everything about everything.	Omnia de omnibus.
This work is to stop.	Hoc opus est prohibere.
But certainly there is need.	Sed certe opus est.
To me everything, pretty everything.	Mihi omnia, satis omnia.
She can neither leave nor stay.	Illa nec relinquere nec manere potest.
Certainly someone else did.	Certe aliquis certe fecit.
The job is to do it.	Officium est id facere.
This is not the same.	Hoc non est simile.
will be right.	recte erit.
He was just one guy.	Erat iustus unus guy.
You can do what you do.	Potes quid feceris.
But from only	Sed a tantum.
No purchases this time.	Nulla id tempus emit.
This does not occur to us.	Id nobis non occurrit.
You need to know.	Scire debes.
Too much generally, but not enough.	Nimium fere, sed parum satis.
Not even this year.	Non eo anno etiam.
It is? 	Est?
This is true.	Hoc verum est.
in who's out front.	In quis ex ante.
And it has been said.	Sed et dictum est.
He knew he would help her.	Sciebat se eam adiuvare.
Very happy.	Ipsum sit amet.
I hope you only understand.	Spero te tantum intelligere.
Maybe this is exactly the case.	Fortasse hoc prorsus.
Yes it is true.	Ita verum est.
And all this is in me.	Et hoc totum in me est.
Which is good.	Quod bonum est.
yes or no.	Etiam vel nulla.
It's going to be me.	Me futurum est.
It could be everything.	Posset esse omnia.
He was not kind.	Genus non erat.
There is no need to do this.	Non opus est hoc facere.
I also had this.	Ego quoque hanc habui.
Well almost alone.	Bene fere solus.
I'm such a teacher.	Im tam magister.
Something else too.	Aliud quoque.
He knew that was my plan.	Meum esse consilium sciebat ille.
I am a man today.	Hodie homo sum.
No one knows better than us what this is.	Quid hoc sit, nemo melius scit quam nos.
There was nothing new.	Nihil novi non fuit.
Which certainly is true for us.	Quod certe verum est nobis.
Time is everything.	Tempus est omnia.
I like it a lot.	Mihi multum placet.
Maybe that's a great idea.	Aliquam id dictum magna.
But he also himself.	Sed et ipsum quam.
But that was it.	Sed id erat.
But that's the same thing too.	Sed id ipsum etiam.
It is enough, rightly so.	Satis est, recte.
No one can find him.	Nemo potest eum invenire.
I believe everybody is doing it now.	Id nunc facere credo omnes.
We didn't believe in.	Nos autem non in.
We are good together.	Bonum simul sumus.
But lately I'm getting up.	Sed nuper ad me questus est.
Someone to see.	Aliquis videre.
He knows he ought to have.	Scit se habere debere.
It is evil indeed.	Malum quidem est.
And not so well.	Et non ita bene.
Never say anything you want.	Numquam aliquid dicere vis.
I know you'd like some more.	Novi, aliquid plus velis.
I can't see.	Ut non video.
And it's way too much.	Et modo nimium est.
And it is not good.	Et non est bonum.
It is certain.	Certum est.
This is exactly what I need.	Hoc est prorsus quod opus est.
And truly you can.	Et vere potes.
I'd like to think about it.	Libet cogitare de illo .
before i am.	ante sum.
No one before or since.	Nulla quis ante vel ex.
Great or great.	Vel magna magna.
they are all.	Omnes sunt.
Maybe it was time.	Aliquam erat tempus.
My dad used to listen to him.	Pater meus eum audire solebat.
He was not alone in this.	Solus in hoc non erat.
There will be more.	Plus futurum est.
Maybe he was already a man yesterday.	Fortasse iam heri erat homo.
I don't need it.	Non opus est.
I just left in there.	Ego iustus in ibi reliquit.
We have one week.	Una septimana habemus.
But none but him.	Nulla sed ipsum nisi.
If there were any, it could be.	Si quid esset, posset.
but he knew what he was doing.	sed sciebat quid faceret.
He is absolutely alone here.	Omnino solus hic est.
She thought he didn't even understand it.	Putavit ne id quidem intellexit.
Therefore it is difficult.	Quare difficile est.
Or perhaps before.	Vel fortasse ante.
She went quickly.	Illa cito abiit.
I'll tell you one thing.	Dicam tibi unum.
how can we not say?	quomodo non possumus dicere?
If he said, it is true.	Si dixit, verum est.
I like it like this.	Mihi placet sic.
And you are not alone.	Et non solum.
If he could, he would have.	Si posset, habere.
I know you say well.	Scio te bene dicere.
He didn't know anything.	Nesciebat aliquid.
one and made.	unum et factum.
He wasn't sure how to deal with it.	Non erat certus quomodo agere.
He looked well.	Vidit bene.
When you are here now.	Cum hic nunc.
Either, or, or	Vel, vel, vel.
I was not my man anymore.	Meus homo non eram amplius.
Something bad is going to happen.	Aliquid mali futurum est.
I said, well.	Dixi, bene.
How, but none.	Quam, sed nulla.
The whole thing.	Totum illud.
Mine was like me.	Meus erat, sicut me.
Believe it with someone.	Credere ei cum aliquo.
He is not prepared.	Paratus non est.
And it is evil.	Et malum est.
I've never seen it before.	Nunquam id ante vidi.
Certainly it was for me.	Mihi certe fuit.
I didn't want you to know the truth.	Nolui te scire verum.
To or there.	Ad vel ibi.
I wonder how much.	Miror quantum.
Now please do something.	Nunc velit aliquid.
We're never home.	Numquam domi sumus.
If there was any	Si quis erat.
But I don't have time out.	Sed non tempus ex.
In on nothing but great things.	In in nisi magna.
Unless that's one thing for me.	Nisi id unum mihi.
Monday is good for me.	Lunae bonum mihi est.
I am not surprised at all.	omnino non miror.
I'm afraid about that.	Ita vereor ut.
He did not see.	Non vidit.
No one ever asked about him.	Nemo umquam de eo quaesivit.
He said with certainty.	Certo dixit.
As he always said himself.	Ut semper dictum ipsum.
I don't want money from anyone.	Nolo pecuniam, de aliquo.
I don't need to be able to.	Non opus est posse.
Tell him what he wants.	Dicere ei quod velit.
Not sure if this may help.	Non certus est, si hoc adiuvet.
He didn't want to hear me.	Nolebat me audire.
That's a lot.	Id sit amet est.
Maybe nothing but none.	Aliquam nec nulla nisi.
That's all.	Totum id est.
Just in case something happened.	Modo si aliquid factum est.
He could not get home without his help.	Potuit domum sine eius auxilio.
He could not win.	Vincere potuit.
You have said it all before.	Ante omnia dixisti.
Maybe someone has to go.	Forsitan aliquis habet ire.
This means nothing.	Hoc modo nihil est.
I have seen everything.	Vidi omnia.
But in the morning	Mane autem .
This is too much.	Nimium hoc est.
It was like that too.	Similis erat id etiam.
The whole time seems to be the same.	Totum tempus etiam ipsum esse videtur.
Probably something else.	Probabiliter aliquid aliud.
This is quite correct.	Hic satis recte.
You'd be right.	Et recte velis.
That's what he wants.	Id quam velit.
But rightly so.	Sed recte.
No, that's not enough.	Nulla id parum est.
I could not speak.	Non potui loqui.
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
I don't like this.	Hoc non placet.
I've been here too long.	Hic nimium diu iam eram.
He is gone.	Abiit.
I am here for you.	Hic ego sum vobis.
He also wants it.	Etiam id velit.
I know you talk to yourself.	Scio te ipsum loqui.
You can talk if you like.	Dicere potes si libet.
We don't do that.	Nos non facere.
i know it does.	scio facit.
I would .	Vellem .
But this does not appear.	Sed hoc non videtur.
it seemed to me a lot.	multum mihi videbatur.
There was no time for me to be happy.	Tempus mihi felix non fuit.
He did not say, but had not.	Non dixit, sed non habuit.
Do what you like, she thought.	Facere quod libet, putavit.
He said nothing about it.	Nihil de illa dixit.
They are too quick.	Nimis cito sunt.
I can't say just great.	Non possum dicere modo magna.
Perhaps you know what this is.	Scis fortasse quid hoc sit.
I know.	Ego scio.
This may be something else.	Hoc potest esse aliquid aliud.
Okay, so forgot.	Bene, sic oblitus est.
I will not say.	Non dicam.
it was never too late.	numquam sero fuit.
To have something.	Habere aliquid.
It's not the only one.	Non solum non est.
The force is great.	Magna vis est.
He loves to talk.	Loqui amat.
We can't talk here.	Non possumus hic loqui.
but I know why.	ego autem cur.
He wanted to talk.	Loqui voluit.
Again I don't know why.	Iterum non cur.
I am by him.	Ego per illum.
He could not.	Qui potuit.
Everything is still.	Omnia adhuc.
But this is not here.	Sed hoc non est hic.
He did the thing well.	Res bene fecit.
I can't talk now.	Non possum dicere modo.
But that was not the same thing.	Sed id ipsum non erat.
This is all.	Hoc totum est.
You will never be my husband.	Numquam vir meus erit.
But it could have done so many things.	Sed fieri potuit ut multa.
Can't talk to him.	Non potest ei loqui.
There was no need to hear.	Nihil opus erat audire.
Not even a.	Ne vel a.
There is.	Ibi est.
You'll never know when.	Numquam te scire quando.
I am not talking about this.	Non de hoc.
There's nothing here.	Nihil huc.
I thought you'd like to know.	Cogitavi ut scire velis.
For I could come after me.	Potui enim venire post me.
I don't know what this is.	Nescio quid hoc est.
Not without me.	Non sine me.
For who is the same.	Etiam quis ipsum enim.
He could not have what he wanted.	Quod vellet, habere non potuit.
I can't see this.	Non possum hoc videre.
There is no one except that.	Nulla quis nisi quam.
That would be so.	Id ita esse.
It is probable.	Probabile est.
And yet he did not come.	Et tamen non venit.
Where is evil?	Ubi est malum?
He is a man.	Ille homo.
She told us about him.	Indicavit nobis de eo.
It is bad.	Malum est.
I don't like that.	Non sicut ille.
He also did not do this.	Hoc etiam non fecit.
I can't live without you.	Sine te vivere non possum.
That's great.	Id magna.
This is my name, and this is my name.	Hoc est nomen meum, et hoc est nomen meum.
There could have been a future in this.	Futurum in hoc esse potuit.
Don't be all too bad here.	Omnibus hic ne nimis.
That was ready.	Id erat paratus.
All right.	Omnia recte.
It can be seen.	Videri potest.
I want these things.	Haec volo.
I am totally the same.	Prorsus ipse sum.
he did what he knows.	fecit quod scit.
See some question now.	Vide nunc aliquam quaestionem.
You can't leave the house.	Domum relinquere non potes.
But there is none at all.	Sed non est nulla.
This is not a problem.	Hoc non est quaestio.
No one knows where you are now.	Nemo scit ubi nunc sis.
He looks at me.	Me non spectat.
Got a job.	Obtinuit officium.
Now is the time.	Nunc tempus est.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
To be truly prepared.	Esse vere paratus.
You know what you want to do and why.	Scis quid vis facere et quare.
Now let it be.	Nunc sit.
I want to talk to her.	Volo eam loqui.
Certainly he does.	Certe facit.
And this is not difficult.	Et id difficile non est.
Don't even see it.	Ne illud quidem vide.
But it is not enough.	Sed parum.
I think you're doing fine.	Puto te facere bene.
He did not know what it was.	Nesciebat quid esset.
I hope this may help someone in the future.	Spero hoc ut aliquem adiuvet in futurum.
Someone is following him.	Quod aliquis eum hac.
I've done something.	Ego feci aliquid.
He could not have had more.	Non potuit plus habere.
Sorry for the long post.	Nos paenitet diu post.
Tomorrow will be better.	Melius cras fore.
I feel really alone.	Vere solus sentio.
I don't want to think.	Nolo cogitare.
But who is it?	Sed quis est.
He only knew how to make a book for himself.	Solus sibi librum facere sciebat.
I don't even have a plan yet.	Ne consilium quidem habeo adhuc.
This one's kind.	Hoc unum genus est.
I just want to see her home.	EGO iustus volo videre eam domum.
Not in .	Non in .
I'm sorry if it wasn't.	Me paenitet si eius fuit.
I don't know her anymore.	Non novi eam amplius.
I want this	Hoc volo .
Yes that is none.	Etiam id nulla est.
It will be different.	Aliud erit.
It's not what he wants.	Etiam non quam velit.
There is something for someone that you don't have.	Est aliquid pro aliquo quod non habes.
However, it is not easy to stop.	Tamen facere non facile est prohibere.
You can know.	Scire potes.
Make it happen.	Fac fieri.
He knows what it is.	Scit quid sit.
I have not seen him at all.	Eum omnino non vidi.
Neither my name nor my name.	Nec meum, nec meum nomen.
how good is it.	quam bonum esse.
But he was not alone.	Solus autem non esset.
He only knows what has happened.	Scit solum quod factum est.
Maybe that was not the case.	Aliquam id nisi erat.
I have to say yes.	Habeo etiam dicere.
He has not even one for himself.	Ne sibi quidem unum habet.
Maybe it was even him.	Aliquam vel erat ipsum.
and the morning after it.	et mane post illud.
His father refused.	Pater eius noluit.
The matter is as follows.	Ita res ita se habet.
The matter was so.	Ita res erat.
We need to talk.	Loqui necesse est nos.
Not too soon indeed.	Non cito quidem.
But no thing could be done.	Sed nulla res potuit fieri.
Yes but not in time.	Etiam sed per est.
You indeed.	Tu quidem.
But even he was himself.	Sed vel ipsum erat.
Certainly not my father.	Certe non pater.
He said more to me than you.	Plus mihi, quam tu, dixit.
I have not forgotten it.	Non oblitus est.
I need to be something.	Mihi opus est ut aliquid sit.
Truly he could not hear him rightly.	Vere eum recte audire non potuit.
But still good.	Sed tamen bonum.
It could be someone who is in.	Posset esse aliquem qui in.
And there is only one way to do this.	Et hoc unum tantum modo facere.
He said for himself.	Pro se ipse dixit.
Maybe it's something else.	Forsitan aliud est.
And he did not yet.	Et nondum fecit.
that is similar.	id est simile.
You won't need me.	Non opus erit mihi.
I don't even know.	Ego ne novi quidem.
I hope she still enjoys it.	Spero tamen eam habet.
He said that he would come.	Dixit se venire.
He said well to you.	Dixit bene tibi.
Who does not .	Qui non .
Not tonight, but.	Non hac nocte, sed.
I just did what I wanted to do.	Modo fecit quod facere voluit.
I never wanted to be.	Numquam volui ut esse.
It is important from the past.	Aliquam sit amet ex erat.
i'm never	numquam sum.
As it was all over now.	Sicut erat in omnibus nunc.
He refused to leave her.	Noluit eam relinquere.
and you're lucky.	et sis felix.
Nothing there, but all there.	Nihil ibi, sed omnia ibi.
he could not go.	ire non potuit.
That's hardly him.	Quod ei vix.
He could not understand.	Posset intelligere.
It hasn't been very late yet.	Hoc tamen non ita ipsum nuper.
He probably already knows if he got one.	Verisimile iam scit si unum obtinuit.
No one can find us here.	Nemo nos hic invenire potest.
But don't let me stop if	Sed noli me prohibere si .
He doesn't say anything for a while.	Non dicit aliquid ad tempus.
I'm really sorry for you.	Vere paenitet me tibi.
But now is the time to go home.	Sed iam tempus est ire domum.
But nothing is the same.	Sed nihil ipsum.
I forgot to do so.	Oblitus sum id.
That is important.	Amet id sit.
But today we have.	Hodie tamen habemus.
I don't know what I need.	Nescio quod opus esse.
It's good to be home.	Bonum est esse domi.
I have a dog.	Canem habeo.
I could not quite understand.	Non potui satis intelligere.
Nothing can stop now.	Nihil nunc prohibere potest.
Not me	Non me .
To him.	Ad eum.
Don't get sick.	Non male.
Maybe it's totally so.	Fortasse prorsus ita est.
Tell me how this is going to happen to you.	Dic modo tibi hoc futurum.
Completely understood.	Omnino intellexit.
Or perhaps well from him.	Vel bene fortasse ex eo.
He doesn't want to talk.	Is loqui non vult.
For it would be if it were not.	Esset enim si non esset.
I never wanted to see you again.	Numquam iterum videre volui.
Maybe not before him.	Aliquam nec ipsum ante.
He also refused.	Ille etiam noluit.
Which, what he did not know.	Quod, id quod nesciebat.
Here, without me.	Hic, sine me.
Perhaps we are.	Forsitan sumus.
I know how to think.	Scio cogitare.
I think nothing, but he made me better.	Nihil puto, sed melius me fecit.
We too.	Nos quoque.
How? 	Quam?
Of this I am rightly certain.	De hoc recte certum habeo.
This could not be done in this way.	Hoc modo fieri non potuit.
That's exactly the same thing.	Prorsus id ipsum.
Maybe that's how.	Aliquam id quam.
See if you like.	Vide si placet.
We cannot believe.	Credere non possumus.
How not to go here.	Ut non quam hic.
But it was so.	Sed ita se habuit.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
This he did to himself.	Hoc fecit sibi.
Finally all went well.	Tandem omnes ad bene.
Not sure if this is it?	Non certus si hoc est?
I really love you.	Ego vere amo.
He refused to stay.	Noluit manere.
I really love you!	Ego vere amo!.
It is not necessary.	Non est necesse.
Yes exactly.	Ita prorsus.
But it is not the same.	Sed non est ipsum.
Don't get too much.	Noli nimis accipere.
It's not your job.	Non est officium tuum.
That was at home.	Quod erat domi.
What do we have here? 	Quid hic habemus?
That would be me indeed.	Quod quidem esset me.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
He a.	Ipse a.
You can't leave me without you.	Sine te me relinquere non potes.
That was three years ago and now.	Quod erat ante annos tres et nunc.
I thought it would be a good time for us.	Putavi nos tempus bonum fore.
Don't do better now.	Noli facere melius nunc.
That is more than money.	Id est quam pecuniam.
I don't think of any of that.	Non cogitare de aliquo esse.
This is not possible.	Ita fieri non potest.
Look at this first.	Primum hoc vide.
He willed.	Voluit.
I thought we could do more.	Cogitavi nos non facere amplius.
These are easy to find.	Facile sunt haec invenire.
You'll never talk.	Numquam loqui.
But the people are still there.	Homines non etiam ibi sed.
Stay with us.	Mane nobiscum.
But there is more.	Plus tamen est.
Nothing will ever be good again.	Nihil umquam bene erit iterum.
They are just	Iustus sunt .
I can't be like this again.	Iterum sic esse non possum.
Yes I said no.	Etiam non dictum nulla.
To be very happy.	Ut sit amet ipsum ipsum.
We are really, really good.	Vere sumus, vere bonum est.
However, he could not do it.	Tamen non potuit eum facere.
He does not come to me.	Non venit ad me.
It's there to be.	Est ibi esse.
Now that's in it.	Iam quod in.
But we are not.	Sed non sumus.
Even who always wants.	Etiam quis semper velit.
That's all pretty much.	Ut omnes fere.
He has not left me.	Non me reliquit.
There will be time.	Tempus erit.
It's in his game.	Est in eius velit.
People are always with him for what he wants.	Homines semper cum eo quod vult.
He did the same as he said.	Fecit id ipsum ut dixit.
But you must not do the whole work itself.	Sed totum opus ipsum facere non debes.
They are just too quick.	Iustus nimium cito sunt.
Something was going to happen.	Aliquid futurum erat.
This I will, this I will.	Hoc volo, hoc volo.
And well indeed.	Et bene quidem.
He gave it to me already.	Jam mihi dedit.
If you can, you can.	Si potes, potes.
This is what has been done.	Hoc est quod factum est.
That ought to be.	Id debet esse.
Don't stay on.	Noli manere in.
She really wanted to be in the office.	Illa vere voluit in esse officium.
I know what you've done.	Scio quid feceris.
This is good and bad.	Hoc est bonum et malum.
And if not, it should.	Et si non, debet.
You are doing well.	Bene facis.
I feel too much for him.	Nimium tibi pro illo sentio.
If anyone can do it, we can do it.	Si quis id facere potest, nos id facere possumus.
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
Look at what's happened.	Vide quid acciderit.
He said that he would stay.	Dixit se manere.
He does this for us all.	Hoc facit pro nobis omnibus.
He wants to see her home, to see her.	Domum suam vult videre, eam videre.
I can't see you here.	Hic non possum videre.
But as much as possible.	Sed ut quam quam.
You don't have to be there to know.	Non enim esse ibi te scire.
To be seen.	Esse videri.
I love you too!	Te etiam amo!.
At the same time.	Simul.
and it is yours.	et tuum est.
you must act.	agere debes.
No he is not himself.	Nulla non ipsum est.
He said she was not alone.	Dixit non solum eam.
I shouldn't have tried to go.	Non debet me ire conatus.
But yet it was time.	Sed sed tempus erat.
I even told him about you.	Ego quidem ei de te dixi.
Something else.	Aliquid aliud.
Not really.	Non vere.
Soon, soon he went away.	Mox, mox abiit.
You know what you like.	Scis quid libet.
You can leave now.	Nunc relinquere potes.
This never happened.	Hoc nunquam factum est.
I still believe.	adhuc credo.
may not get any better.	Ut non aliquam melius.
But that's the same thing.	Sed id ipsum.
Maybe right, maybe not.	Fortasse recte, fortasse non.
I don't like this at all.	Hoc omnino non placet.
I want to have this really in my school.	Hoc vere in schola mea habere volo.
Now he knows what to do.	Nunc scit quid faciam.
This post may help you.	Hoc post te adiuvet.
To do more and to act.	Plus agere et agere.
He said this was necessary.	Hoc opus esse dixit.
He was there.	Erat ibi.
It is also great.	Etiam magna.
It was late this year.	Hoc anno sero factum est.
But the time was not, as has been said.	Sed tempus non erat ut dictum.
This is not one.	Hoc non est unum.
What a week.	Quid a septimana.
We can't do this much.	Non possumus hoc tantum fieri.
It's not hard to see.	Hoc non est difficile videre.
Have something else today.	Habet aliquid aliud hodie.
And don't stop.	Et noli prohibere.
He always comes at night.	Semper nocte venit.
But it is so.	Sed ita est.
I know what I did.	Scio quod fecerit.
It is important to refer to.	Aliquam sit amet dictum ex.
At first he didn't want to see me at all.	Primum me omnino videre nolebat.
And well	Et bene .
None of this has been written.	Nulla id dictum enim.
That would not be good.	Quod non esset bonum.
I hope this is not true.	Hoc utinam non sit.
You don't wanna be with anyone.	Et non habes cum aliquo.
It's really easy to understand.	Vere facile est intelligere.
Now tell me something.	Nunc aliquid dic.
It could not have been done without it.	Fieri sine illa non potuit.
Well, that's enough.	Bene, satis est.
This was going to happen.	Hoc futurum erat.
Not after what was done.	Non post id quod factum est.
There is no need to do it.	Nihil opus est facere.
I have tried.	Conatus sum.
This is my first work.	Hoc est primum opus.
But no matter.	Sed nulla rem.
We're on the lookout.	In vultus sumus.
There is no way to do that.	Non est facere ut.
Or perhaps it was not.	Vel fortasse non erat.
But there is one thing you need to know.	Sed unum est quod scire debes.
This doesn't take a lot of time.	Hoc non multum temporis.
Never been there again.	Ibi numquam iterum.
You know what you mean.	Scis vis.
Maybe it was, just a little.	Fortasse fuit, paulo.
But he could not do this.	Sed hoc facere non potuit.
Well here we're all at home.	Bene hic domi sumus omnes.
But so it is true.	Sed ita verum .
He refused to leave his room.	Noluit cubiculum suum relinquere.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
I don't know who's from.	Nescio quis a.
But it was yesterday and this morning again.	Sed heri et hoc mane iterum fuit.
There was none in him.	Nulla in ipsum erat.
I am the father.	Pater sum.
You told me that too.	Dixisti mihi id quoque.
He is also here with us.	Etiam hic nobiscum est.
It could not be.	Non potuit esse.
It's fine with me.	Bene est mecum.
Here they are, she thought.	Hic sunt, putavit.
Now I just need to do the job.	Nunc, sicut opus est facere officium.
This is through you.	Hoc per te.
There was nothing in it.	Nulla in erat nisi.
No one told him to do this.	Nemo dixit ei ut hoc faceret.
At length he said: No.	Tandem dixit: non.
There was something to see.	Fuit, quod vide.
It's hard to play.	Ludere difficile est.
But this is the matter.	Sed haec res est.
That is your job too.	Tuum sit id quoque.
No fun from him.	Nulla sit amet ex ipsum.
and so you owe it.	et sic debes.
There is something to this.	Est aliquid dictum ad id.
It does not please.	Non placet.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
Has something to say.	Habet aliquid dicere.
I know almost everyone.	Novi fere omnes.
You have not forgotten.	Non es oblitus.
You can only be.	Modo potes esse.
This has been a problem for us as well.	Haec quaestio in nobis quoque fuit.
But neither was he himself.	Sed nec ipsum erat.
Maybe I'm afraid.	Vereor ne forte.
In both of us.	In nobis utrumque.
It was scarcely possible.	Vix erat.
He could not have as much as he desired.	Quantum vellet, habere non potuit.
He is a dog.	Canis est.
This he thinks.	Hoc cogitat.
Good and good.	Bene et bonum.
If so it was good.	Si ita bene fuit.
But we cannot do this.	Sed hoc non possumus facere.
He just thinks.	Iustus cogitat.
You have no need to do this work.	Non opus est tibi ut hoc opus facias.
No he was not.	Nulla non erat.
I'm supposed to tell.	Im narrare volo.
Now he's finally here.	Nunc tandem hic est.
You know, really great.	Scis, vere magna.
That's when you're here.	Id cum hic sis.
I couldn't either.	Non potui vel.
I don't really want to know.	Non vere scire vis.
How does he know?	Quomodo scit.
That or not.	Id vel non.
But what is good?	Sed quid est bonum.
Yes it is like you.	Ita est, sicut tu.
Look what the future is like.	Vide quid futurum simile est.
But he loves men.	Sed amat homines.
I know that's the same thing.	Novi id idem.
I have help.	Habeo auxilium.
That's the same thing as before.	Ut id ipsum ante.
I only want to be friends.	Tantum volo amicos esse.
did not succeed.	non obtinuit.
How lucky are you.	Ut felix es.
I can see it's hard.	Difficile est videre possum.
But it has the same effect.	Sed simile quidem habet.
But time has been said.	Sed tempus dictum est.
All these things are great.	Haec omnia magna sunt.
No, this is not possible.	Non, hoc fieri non potest.
I don't know how you got through the day.	Nescio quomodo per diem obtinuit.
Now it was noon for me.	Nunc in me erat meridiem.
You are not one.	Non unum.
It's enough to know about me already.	De me iam satis est scire.
I wonder if this is true.	Miror si verum est.
He would never do this.	Numquam hoc facturum esse.
Not even that.	Ne id quidem.
Tell her that it is okay.	Dic ei quod bene est.
To me too.	Ad me quoque.
Something must be wrong.	Malum aliquid sit necesse est.
He refused to say what it was.	Noluit dicere quid sit.
I am just.	Iustus sum ego.
That's what you think.	Id quod cogitas.
If you do not do it, you do not.	Si non feceris, non facis.
How can this even be done?!	Quomodo etiam hoc fieri potest?!.
He is speaking.	Loquitur.
That's it now.	Id nunc.
And it seemed like to him.	Et videbatur ei similis.
never in the future.	numquam in futurum.
It's more likely than this.	Verisimile est illud quam hoc.
I was scared of him.	Vix ei ex essem.
You are evil yourself.	Malum est te ipsum.
Or it doesn't.	Vel non facit.
I could not speak of his kind.	Suum genus dicere non potui.
Not this morning.	Non hoc mane.
It is necessary to know what it is.	Scire necesse est quid sit.
Which seems hard to believe.	Quod difficile videtur credere.
He did well.	Bene se fecit.
my husband knows.	vir meus scit.
Well, he wasn't going to do that.	Bene, quod facturus non erat.
I wanted a job.	officium volui.
You are not alone here.	Non solum hic.
He can see nothing.	Nihil potest videre.
You do both well.	Bene utrumque facis.
She said she did not want to see him again that night.	Dixit illa nocte iterum videre nolebat.
He did not know where he was.	Nesciebat ubi esset.
I do not know.	Nescio.
And yet it is not seen.	Et tamen non videtur.
I had one there.	Unum habui ibi.
We have very	Valde habemus .
He now saw what he wanted.	Vidit nunc quid vellet.
I just don't play anything.	Modo aliquid non ludere.
If you are not sure whether to go or not to go.	Si non es certus utrum ire vel non ire.
Now get out there.	Nunc ut ex enim.
I can't help this time.	Hoc tempore adiuvare non possum.
No one knows why.	Quare nemo scit.
To sit.	Ut sit.
I heard about you.	Audivi de te.
Not the very thing that has just been said.	Non id ipsum quod modo dictum est.
This time is not going to happen.	Hoc tempus non futurum est.
He who knows himself very well is sure.	Qui optime se novit, is certus est.
Even before that.	Etiam ante quam.
But he does not speak.	Sed non loquitur.
And that is.	Et ut est.
He knows this now.	Scit hoc nunc.
Maybe not.	Fortasse non.
It is possible.	Fieri potest.
And him too.	Et eum etiam.
No one wants to say for sure.	Pro certo nemo dicere vult.
Maybe it's not.	Aliquam nec est.
you must go.	ire debes.
It seemed to help so much.	Tantum videbatur auxilio.
That's when it's done.	Quod cum factum est.
The whole journey was over.	Totum iter erat.
This is my advice.	Hoc meum consilium est.
If you only call me.	Si tu modo me.
I don't have much to tell you.	Non multum habeo tibi dicere.
I just don't know.	Modo non scio.
I never do it now.	Numquam id nunc.
I need to say it.	Dicere opus est.
Please don't, she thought.	Quaeso ne, id putavit.
He is me.	Ipse me.
What she could hear.	Quod posset audire.
And it was evil.	Et factum est malum.
But things aren't there either.	Sed res non ibi vel.
It could not be done.	Fieri non potuit.
It's time to do something.	Aliquam nec aliquam est.
I've never been there before.	Nunquam ibi ante fui.
Totally correct.	Prorsus recte.
You are already with me.	Jam mihi es.
I never wanted a boy.	Numquam puer volui.
I have done my job.	Feci officium meum.
You'd like to go.	Ire velis.
Something like that.	Aliquid simile quod .
And he truly understood.	Et vere intellexit.
To always ask for.	Ut a semper enim.
And he likes it badly.	Et male vult.
Even his name has something to say.	Etiam nomen eius aliquid habet quod dicam.
It will be good for him and for us.	Pro se et nobis bene erit.
Or her father said to him.	Vel dixit ei pater suus.
But I will not be happy.	Sed non erit felix.
This is your school.	Haec schola tua est.
It is none of his.	Eius nulla sit.
This is good.	Is est bonus.
It was only late now.	Tantum nunc sero erat.
it looks good.	bonum videtur.
Yes that was always.	Etiam id semper erat.
He refused what he saw.	Noluit quod vidit.
This time was enough.	Hoc nunc satis erat.
But his name is not true.	Sed non est nomen eius verum.
I wish you would not do it.	Utinam non facias.
Evil is evil.	Malum est malum.
Time is not enough for me.	Parum mihi tempus est.
That's not enough.	Non satis id.
That is one thing.	Illud unum est.
I could hardly speak.	Vix loqui potui.
And that's the thing.	Et id est rem.
But there is something more.	Sed est aliquid amplius.
I don't regret getting the job.	Non paenitet questus officium.
It is between .	Est inter .
You are already here.	Iam hic es.
You are all three.	Omnes vos tres.
He never came.	Numquam venit.
But it is something.	Sed aliquid est est.
You are never alone.	Solus sis numquam.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum est.
Please take some time alone.	Aliquam tempus velit solum.
This class is for you.	Hoc genus est tibi.
We all have	Omnes habemus .
You just know what you are doing.	Tu modo quid facias.
It's pretty easy to do.	Facere satis facile est.
But it is not possible.	Sed non potest.
You got it okay.	Et bene obtinuit eam.
The dog could do it.	Canis facere potuit.
You have probably more.	Probabiliter plus habes.
Made me think a lot.	Cogitare me fecit multum.
We have each other, she thought.	Habemus inter se, putavit.
This time it was not.	Hoc tempus non erat.
But that was the same.	Sed id erat ipsum.
We need your help so that it can be done.	Auxilium tuum nobis opus est ut id fieri possit.
He knew well enough that he could not help it.	Satis bene sciebat illud adiuvare non posse.
This is completely unsupported.	Hoc omnino sine.
Now I could see.	Nunc videre potui.
Bad one.	Malum unum.
And often you know it.	Sed et saepe scis.
I always do.	Ego semper facio.
You know.	Tu scis.
No one wants to play with us.	Nemo nobiscum ludere vult.
You'll never get this.	Numquam quo ut.
I was still alive.	adhuc fui.
I have said this before.	Haec ante dixi.
But no time except.	Sed nec tempus nisi.
Now we can see.	Nunc videre possumus.
I don't suspect.	Non suspicor.
I was not there at the time.	Non eram ibi tempore.
This is just home.	Hoc modo domum.
No one knows me.	Nemo me scit.
I could say nothing at all.	Nihil prorsus cogitare potui dicere.
It was great.	Magna erat .
Not without you.	Nec sine te.
But it is not the same.	Sed nec ipsum est.
I don't know what it is.	Quid sit nescio.
i haven't seen.	ego non vidi.
it was much better today.	hodie multo melius fuit.
The thing is	Res est .
I was at home.	Ego eram domi.
He saw all these things.	Vidit haec omnia.
I never want to see you.	Numquam te videre volo.
I can do my job well.	Bene facere possum officium meum.
Got the man now.	Obtinuit nunc homo.
I am so very glad.	Ita valde gaudeo.
To know the truth is.	Scire verum est.
Can't stop.	Non potest prohibere.
Here, it was.	Hic, fuit.
But now was not the time.	Sed nunc tempus non erat.
This is often good.	Hoc saepe bonum est.
It is no longer there.	Jam non est.
And so it was.	Et ita factum est.
It was not so.	Non erat, sic.
I love him very much.	Eum valde amo.
That's great.	Ut id est magna.
I didn't know what to do.	Quid agere nesciebam.
that was the name.	id nomen erat.
i know you're already doing it.	scio te iam id facere.
It was truly like this.	Vere sic fuit.
The one who	Eum, qui.
That something was.	Quod aliquid esset.
Now is the time to go.	Nunc tempus ut est.
But that's none other than that.	Sed id nulla nisi.
I wish you were so good.	Utinam tam bonus.
So it is.	Ita est.
However, it is very important.	Autem, magna cum ipsum.
He seemed not quite sure what to do.	Non satis certum videbatur quid.
You don't have to tell us what happened.	Non habes nobis cur acciderit.
No one really knew what it was.	Nemo vere sciebat quid esset.
He said that he would help.	Dixit id se adiuvare.
Which is not at all here.	Quod omnino non est hic.
He wanted her again.	Iterum vellet eam.
That's what he almost did.	Id fere fecit.
Thus he said.	Sic ille.
There was also .	Fuit etiam .
He can go.	Ire potest.
He did it right.	Recte fecit.
He could do better, though.	Melius facere potuit, sed.
But tomorrow is nothing.	Cras sed est nisi.
Or at least better.	Melius certe vel.
Nor is it necessary.	Nec est necesse.
Never, never feel it with you.	Nunquam, nunquam tecum sentio.
Please leave me with him.	Me cum illo velit relinquere.
This is your.	Tuum est.
This he did.	Hoc fecit.
You can see this too.	Hoc quoque videre potes.
We can't even talk.	Ne loqui quidem possumus.
It's not time for him.	Etiam non tempus ipsum.
I need it so badly, to have it without me.	Tam male mihi opus est, sine me habere.
I don't know what to say.	Quid dicam nescio.
This is not about him.	Hoc non est de eo.
.	.
We can do everything.	Nos omnia possumus.
He wanted to be there.	Ibi esse voluit.
i thought it was right.	recte putavi.
I have not forgotten.	non sum oblitus.
Nothing is wrong.	Nihil est mali.
Maybe he still did it.	Fortasse adhuc fecit.
This man can do nothing.	Hic homo nihil potest.
It is not difficult.	Non est difficile.
Tell me what happened.	Dic quid acciderit.
He said nothing.	Nihil dixit.
If not, no.	Si non, non.
You can do it too.	Facere id quoque potes.
But what to do without him? 	Sed quid sine illo facere?
.	.
I'm sure, for sure.	Me certe, certe.
It's up to us to do it.	Facere nobis est.
And we can't stay.	Et manere non possumus.
Nothing I can do.	Nihil possum facere.
i don't know why not.	nescio cur non.
And the boy came to help him.	Puer autem venit ad auxilium eius.
I have to talk to you.	Habeo tecum loqui.
I can help more.	Plus possum adiuvare.
could never do it.	numquam facere posse.
But this is not possible.	Sed hoc non potest.
And you never will.	Et numquam et.
Certainly this.	Hac certe.
This is very unlikely.	Hoc est valde probabile.
But he can say nothing about this.	Sed de hoc nihil potest dicere.
I thought you were one of us.	Putabam te esse unum ex nobis.
He was so good.	Tam bonus erat.
It was as good as it ever was.	Fuit tam bona quam semper fuit.
That was it.	Id erat id.
This was indeed done.	Quod quidem factum fuit.
I love you a lot.	Multum amo te.
He tries to give nothing.	Nihil dare conatur.
I am not afraid.	Non vereor.
.	.
He didn't want to do that tonight.	Noluit hac nocte facere.
even to this day by all.	usque hodie per omnes usque.
You are here.	Hic es tu.
The thing is that you do this one thing.	Res est ut hoc unum facias.
But he himself.	Ipse tamen.
All the same.	Omnibus idem.
It's not how it is.	Etiam non quam est.
I would not do this.	Hoc facere nolui.
It does not please.	Non placet.
I believe you don't know.	Credo te nescire.
I don't believe you could.	Non credo posse.
and no one knows it.	et nemo nescit.
Who can help me?	Quis me adiuvet.
Really not.	Vere non.
I can't do it.	Non possum facere.
I absolutely love this.	Omnino hic amo.
But that was not.	Sed id non erat.
A.	A .
Not enough money, for sure.	Non satis pecuniae, certe.
I'll tell you.	Dicam.
That's it now.	Id nunc.
It seemed to be working.	Videbatur opus esse.
You're gonna do it.	Id amet es.
What was, this was.	Quod fuit, hoc fuit.
No need for sure.	Non opus est, certe.
It's not so hard to think.	Non ita difficile est cogitare.
He never wants it.	Numquam id velit.
It will always be.	Semper erit.
No, that was great.	Nulla id magna erat.
Let me do something.	Fac mihi aliquid.
He was lucky.	Felix fuit.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
him or himself.	Ipsum vel ipsum.
He looked like nothing new.	Vidit nihil novi simile.
I just go here.	Modo huc ire.
And it is easy to see why.	Et facile est videre quare.
That is not easy.	Quod non est facile.
I've never seen it before.	Numquam id ante.
But you know something.	Sed scis aliquid.
He knows now.	Scit nunc.
If you want to.	Si vis.
You can't win.	Vincere non potes.
You can't want the same thing.	Non potes idem velle.
I hope things get better for you.	Spero res melius tibi.
No he is not himself.	Nulla non est ipsum.
Not only yourself.	Non nisi ipsum.
I was kind of wrong.	genus mali fui.
Well, you're not alone.	Bene tu solus non es.
She did it in the morning.	Mane illa fecit.
But that's none of it.	Sed id ipsum nulla.
I have another plan.	Aliud habeo consilium.
He knew for sure.	Pro certo sciebat.
And indeed nothing comes from it.	Et quidem ex eo nihil venit.
if not more.	si non plus.
He made this decision not easy.	Non facile hoc consilium fecit.
I am very glad that you have done it.	Valde gaudeo quod tu fecisti.
likely not likely.	Verisimile non est verisimile.
But he was very happy.	Sed sit amet erat ipsum.
But he could not play.	Sed ludere non posse.
He could not even see.	Ne videre quidem potuit.
i know it's still there.	Scio adhuc esse.
Make me.	Fac me.
let him in.	Sit ei in.
You did enough tonight.	Satis hac nocte fecisti.
Don't talk to me like this.	Noli mihi sic loqui.
But this was said only.	Sed id dictum nisi.
I used to do this type of video.	Ego genus video hoc facere solebat.
I have not yet heard.	nondum audivi.
But that is how.	Sed id est quam.
But this was scarcely possible.	Sed hoc vix fuit.
It was from some story.	Aliquam a aliquam erat.
All soon to be happy.	Omnes mox sit amet.
You know it all.	Scis illud.
tell me about it again.	dic mihi de eo iterum.
This is what you have here.	Hoc est quod habes hic.
I have not seen.	Non vidi.
I have been.	Fui.
He would like to know what was going to happen.	Se scire quid esset futurum.
But there is more.	Plus tamen est.
Certainly to me.	Mihi certe.
Which one is important here.	Quod autem hic sit amet.
Do what you need.	Fac quod tibi opus sit.
But you .	Sed tu .
You can play next week.	Proxima septimana ludere potes.
Police have not said.	Aliquam nec dictum est.
I can't talk to him.	Non possum dicere ei.
But I don't think so.	Non puto te, sed.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
Maybe not great.	Aliquam non magna.
But he has something to give.	Sed habet aliquid dare.
Now he says no more.	Iam amplius non dicit.
It was pretty loud.	Satis magna erat.
It was already enough.	Iam satis erat.
But he truly knows.	Sed scit vere.
But they are not there.	Sed non sunt ibi.
It's big enough, which is great.	Est satis magna, quae magna est.
Yes, that's the same thing now.	Etiam id nunc ipsum.
You don't have to know everything about him.	Non habes omnia scire de se.
You'd better be sure.	Melius certe velis.
You have friends.	Habes amicos.
He should not stay here.	Hic manere non debet.
You only need to believe.	Tu tantum credere debes.
But today was something else.	Sed hodie aliquid aliud fuit.
Yes it is from me.	Sic est a me.
But better.	Sed melius.
He does this pretty easy.	Hoc satis facile facit.
This was what he was about to do.	Hoc erat quod facturus erat.
I know that it was.	Scio fuisse.
It could work better.	Melius esse posset opus.
But none of this is the same.	Sed nulla id ipsum.
never ought .	numquam debet .
Now, you know.	Modo, scis.
You can't come to us yet.	Ad nos adhuc venire non potes.
he had only one	unum tantum habuit.
I've heard it now.	Audivi modo.
We can't stop living this way.	Hoc modo vivere possumus prohibere.
Nothing has been done yet.	Nihil tamen factum est.
Money is a bad decision.	Malum est consilium pecuniae.
He knew he was making a decision.	Sciebat se consilium facere.
But there is one thing for sure.	Sed unum certe est.
I don't like that advice.	Non placet ut consilium.
That's not right.	Quod non recte.
The whole thing to do.	Totum ad.
But it is the same.	Sed id ipsum est.
In this we have none.	In id nulla nobis.
Why are all men	Cur omnes homines sunt.
Don't forget it.	Ita non oblitus.
This is what it looks like.	Hoc est quod videtur.
But not him.	Sed non ipsum.
And never love him.	Et numquam ipsum.
I hope you do.	Spero te facere.
I'm not sure.	Im 'certus non sum.
That's what we do.	Id quod nos.
We are all men.	Omnes homines sumus.
That's it now.	Id nunc.
Who is not in this.	Quis non sit in hac.
Well almost nothing.	Bene fere nihil.
Unable to go to school.	Posset ad scholam.
Nothing more can be done.	Nihil amplius fieri potest.
You are at home.	Domi es.
I know they are.	Novi sunt.
And it came to his home.	Factum est autem in domum suam.
And perhaps it was a bad decision.	Et fortasse malum consilium fuit.
perhaps it was.	fortasse fuit.
Actually, they are.	Vere, sunt.
Don't talk.	Non loqui.
How much to give.	Quantum dare.
He was also a great man.	Etiam quis magna erat.
I want that to be good.	quod bonum esse volo.
Maybe who was that.	Aliquam quis erat quam.
This is what the father can do.	Hoc est quod pater facere potest.
But never hear it.	Sed numquam id audire.
I never wanted.	Numquam volui.
I don't believe everything.	Non credo omnia.
That will be a day, and there will be one day.	Quod erit dies, et erit dies unus.
But it always is.	Sed id semper est.
He can hardly speak.	Vix loqui potest.
I want to help you.	Volo te adiuvare.
It is not.	Non sit.
It will never be like this.	Numquam sic erit.
Not long yet.	Non diu tamen.
But there was no time.	Sed nec tempus erat.
I think you only do a good job.	Puto tantum bene rem bene facere.
He barely knew what he was doing.	Vix sciebat quid faceret.
And something about him.	Et aliquid de eo.
This is only good for you.	Hoc solum est bonum es.
Maybe you already have.	Fortasse iam habes.
Thus just.	Sic iustus .
Truly it was done.	Vere factum est.
But he himself knew that he ought not to do this.	Ipse autem sciebat se hoc facere non debere.
We have much better.	Multo melius habemus.
But it is not always so.	Sed non semper sic.
He was too good.	Nimis bonus erat.
But that is none as it is.	Sed id nulla est, ut est.
Rightly indeed.	Recte quidem.
Good thing too.	Bona res quoque.
I didn't think it would happen.	Non putavi fore.
Now we have this chance.	Nunc forte hoc habemus.
They generally need to be treated.	Et fere opus est ut debet.
I saw him now.	Vidi eum modo.
This is good for him.	Hoc est bonum eius.
I love you I love you.	Amo te amo.
It's not mine.	Meum non est.
He is the same.	Ipse est.
Maybe it was either.	Aliquam vel erat.
I'm not sure what to do.	Certus sum quid facerem.
But that's only the time.	Sed id tempus nisi.
But there is a lot to be done.	Sed sit amet est est.
There is no such thing.	Nulla res est.
We can have both.	Utrumque habere possumus.
Almost like him.	Eum fere similis.
He does not speak, there is no need.	Nec loquitur, non opus est.
You know me.	Scis mecum.
But not how to be honest.	Sed non quam sit amet erat.
Most likely and never will.	Verisimile et nunquam erit.
But it's not about sorry or not sorry.	Sed non est de me paenitet vel non paenitet.
I will tell you.	Dicam tibi.
And this was true.	Et hoc verum fuit.
But there was no wish.	Sed non erat velit.
This has not been done in this way.	Hoc modo factum non est.
It used to be someone.	Solebat esse aliquem.
It was too late.	Sero erat.
Who can help me?	Quis me adiuvet.
Not well.	Non bene.
But there is only one.	Sed non est nisi.
But no matter	Sed nulla res.
I hope you're too.	Spero te nimis.
It won't be too bad.	Non erit nimis malum.
Watch this video.	Vide hoc video.
Where is my father	Ubi est pater meus.
I know what you mean.	Scio quid velis.
which I still know.	quam adhuc scio.
Even if you don't want to.	Etiam non nisi velit.
I heard so much.	Tantum ego audivi.
She could stop today.	Posset hodie prohibere.
No, it is necessary to go.	Non, necesse est ire.
It was never done like this.	Numquam sic factum est.
But you can do it here.	Sed hic potes.
I believe you will do it.	credo te facturum esse.
I do not know.	Nescio.
This is the first time.	Hoc est primum.
What was that? 	Quid erat illud?
I need to answer the question.	Mihi opus est ad quaestionem.
After you do.	Post te fac.
I wanted him to be like that.	Volui id ipsum esse ut.
he said, he said.	dixit, dixit.
That's too much.	Nimium id.
None but said no.	Nulla sed dictum nulla.
Or almost everything.	Vel fere omnia.
As I have not said before.	Ut nec dictum ante.
It was never to be.	Esse numquam erat.
My father did it.	Pater meus fecit.
He really wished he wasn't.	Vere velit non erat.
I will speak to him in the morning.	Dicam ei mane.
If he were here	Si hic esset .
Even now I will not be interested in the past.	Etiam non nunc sit amet ante.
This season has been replaced.	Hoc tempus iam pro.
I was in one.	in una fui.
He could not speak truth.	Vere loqui non potuit.
Well, now, it's fine.	Bene, iam, bene est.
You mean a.	Vis a.
Maybe we can help.	Forsitan adiuvare possumus.
He alone is there.	Solus ibi.
The boy is the thing.	Puer res est.
That is.	Id est.
It is time to think about many things.	Tempus est multa cogitare.
I just want to get home to her.	EGO iustus volo domum ad eam.
The next time you	Proximo tempore tibi .
It hasn't been long enough.	Non satis diu fuit.
Never give it up.	Numquam eam.
I can live hard.	Vivere difficile possum.
I don't know somehow.	Nescio quo modo.
I would like to be there.	ibi esse vellem.
But he didn't want to be able to think of it.	Sed nolebat cogitare de illo posse.
which he did.	quae fecit.
i'm sure i love you.	Im 'certus amo te.
He did not do well at home.	Non fecit bene domi.
To do that, how very happy.	Facere id, quam sit amet ipsum.
i could do it today.	potui hodie.
No one can be so sure or not.	Nemo tam pro certo esse potest necne.
Nothing else will happen to you.	Nihil aliud tibi futurum est.
That's gonna be great.	Ut sit amet magna.
Not much, but still.	Non multum, sed tamen.
I thought.	Cogitavi.
I'm afraid if this is true.	Vereor si hoc verum sit.
The first is evil.	Primum malum est.
Yet it seemed the same to all.	Idem tamen omnibus videbatur.
I don't need this.	Non opus est hoc.
I wonder who could speak like this to him.	Miror quis sic sibi loqui posset.
All right, though.	Recte, sed.
There is something between you or me.	Est aliquid inter te an' me.
But this is enough.	Sed hoc satis est.
That's the same thing.	Id ipsum est.
He is a boy.	Puer est.
Yes, but there was nothing.	Etiam sed erat nisi.
What was he going to do to him.	Quid sibi facturus esset.
Maybe not even it.	Fortasse ne sit quidem.
If happy, there is only one.	Si felix, una tantum est.
But what he will do is he will do it.	Sed quod facturus est facturus est.
This deal is nothing new.	Hoc multum est nihil novi.
He wanted to know everything.	Omnia scire voluit.
Who is who	Quis quis est.
He said something.	Aliquid dixit.
I was a man.	vir fui.
They are probably.	Probabiliter, sunt.
When and .	Cum et .
He made sure it was and was good.	Fecit et certus fuit quod bonum fuit.
This is not so.	Hoc non ita est.
Who did not see.	Quis non vidit.
You can do a lot of things.	Facere potes multum.
And so so	Et sic sic.
and no one could know.	et nemo scire potuit.
It was not great.	Non magna erat.
Lunch is good.	Prandium est bonum.
He can tell the story.	Rem narrare potest narrare.
That may or may not make you very happy.	Quod sit vel non sit tibi valde felix.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
Why so?	Cur ita.
Don't talk to me like this.	Noli mihi sic loqui.
I'd be happy to be there.	Ibi felix esse vellem.
no one to speak.	nemo loqui.
He said something in this way.	Hoc modo aliquid dixit.
And he was to her.	Erat autem ad eam.
I had time to think.	Tempus habui cogitare.
You know something, she thought.	Scis aliquid, putavit.
You'd like it too.	Id etiam velis.
Which indeed has been done.	Quod quidem factum est.
And he certainly knows what to do with me.	Et quid mecum agere certe nescit.
That's better than good.	Id melius quam bonum.
He already has a wife.	Uxorem iam habet.
He is a good man.	Vir bonus est.
And you know, that would be good.	Et tu scis, bonum fore.
He told me to say the truth.	Dixit mihi verum dicere.
But he did not do this.	Sed hoc non fecit.
I could find it again.	iterum invenire potui.
How to find out.	Quam invenire.
You know who you know.	Scis qui scis.
Never do anything about it.	Nunquam aliquid de illo facturus est.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
I wanted him.	eum volui.
There are things you need to know.	Sunt quae scire debes.
He has not left me after all.	Non me post omnes reliquit.
in not mentioned.	In non dictum est.
Yes it is for this purpose.	Ita est hoc ad.
make my way	iter fac meum.
This would not happen.	Hoc non esset.
For a long time no one has seen anything here.	Diu nemo hic aliquid vidit.
It is always good for me to see it.	Semper mihi bonum est videre eam.
rather than himself.	quam ipsum.
I'm not in school.	In schola non sum.
He always strives to live.	Qui semper vivere conatur.
It was not his evil, it was mine.	Non suum malum, meum fuit.
There seems to be no need for this.	Nihil hoc opus esse videtur.
That was here but no.	Ut hic erat sed nulla.
It means a lot to us.	Multum est nobis.
I wonder if there will be anything else.	Miror si quid erit aliud.
i believe it will be.	credo erit.
I can see nothing in him or through him.	Nihil videre possum in eo vel per illum.
I don't know what happened to him.	Nescio quid ei acciderit.
He is talking about you.	Loquitur pro vobis.
We did it for you.	Nos pro vobis fecit.
Or at least he wants to be.	Vel certe velit esse.
I can do the same.	Idem possum.
Can't do all that he did.	Non potest omnia quae fecit.
I feel this way	Sic sentio .
But this alone is true.	Sed hoc solum est verum.
We can't say enough about him.	De eo satis dicere non possumus.
I've heard everything.	Audivi omnia.
And so both are right.	Et ita recte utrumque.
But there was no time to love him.	Sed tempus non erat ut ipsum.
But he was not out.	Sed non erat ex.
It has already begun, even before the journey.	Iam incepit, etiam ante iter.
I am here, there is.	Hic sum, ibi est.
And he was here.	Erat autem hic.
i am very sick.	Ego multum male.
I believe this too.	Id quoque credo.
But he said no.	Sed et dictum nulla.
He is not alone.	Solus non sit.
Not that.	Non id.
Which and by whom.	Quod et quo.
I don't have this.	Non hoc habere.
he must remain.	manere debet.
You said enough.	Satis dixisti.
I knew all along.	Sciebam per omnia.
This was not true.	Hoc non fuit.
You have many things already.	Multa iam habes.
better but never too late.	melius tamen sero numquam.
We'll never do it soon.	Nobis numquam id cum.
I never got one.	Numquam unum obtinuit.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
Or perhaps it's just good.	Vel fortasse iustus est bonum.
But see it yourself.	Sed id vide ipsum.
That's what he wants.	Id quam velit.
What if what if.	Quid si quid si.
I think everybody owes them.	Omnes puto debere.
I don't need you as a person.	Non opus est tibi ut homo.
You can't stop us.	Non potes prohibere nos.
It's going to happen.	Eius futurum est.
There was at least one child.	Erat puer unus certe.
Now I've been through this with her.	Iam per hoc cum illa fui.
He was a dog.	canis erat.
And so on.	Sic et in.
But he cannot remain.	Sed manere non potest.
We need to do it.	Nobis opus est facere.
That was important to us.	Erat amet nobis id.
You just don't need it.	Te solum non opus est.
It looked different.	Aliud videbatur.
It's time for somebody to like it.	Aliquam quis enim ut est.
But this has been said.	Sed id dictum est.
I don't get any.	Nec aliquam ut.
But this was not always.	Hoc autem non semper fuit.
He knows now.	Scit nunc.
I am surprised so much.	Miror tantum.
He said it was too much.	Nimium esse dixit.
But there is another thing too.	Sed est aliud quoque.
This will be enough.	Hoc satis erit.
It's probably a difficult time.	Per difficile tempus verisimile est.
And it wasn't really so bad.	Et vere non ita malum fuit.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
But not all like this.	Sed non omnes sic.
Someone had to talk.	Habuit aliquis dicere.
Which is nothing but.	Quae nihil nisi.
I could be there.	potui ibi.
and probably a year later.	et probabiliter anno post id.
It's not very good, really.	Non multum est bonum, vere.
This he did.	Hoc fecit.
The journey has been done.	Iter factum est.
And there we are all.	Et ibi omnes sumus.
This won't be easy.	Hoc non erit facile.
This was my job.	Hoc erat officium meum.
You have everything.	Habes omnia.
We can be together.	Simul fieri possumus.
It's been successful.	Suus felix fuit.
It's time to always wish.	Aliquam ut semper velit.
He did not say to him.	Non dixit ei.
I never, ever thought this would happen.	Numquam, umquam hoc futurum putavi.
He wants all things for himself.	Omnia sibi vult.
You're better than me.	Melius quam tu mihi.
He could not believe himself.	Credere se non potuit.
Not only him, but almost everyone.	Non solum eum, sed fere omnes.
It's something to find yourself.	Est aliquid te ipsum invenire.
I am not that man anymore.	Non sum homo ille amplius.
He did not know why.	Cur nesciebat.
i had so much help.	tantum habui auxilium.
And, it is for us.	Et, nobis est.
Look at you so much.	Vide te ita.
You just love.	Vos iustus amo.
He is truly a boy.	Vere puer est.
As always.	Se, ut semper.
He was alone for a time.	Solus ad tempus erat.
It's not enough.	Non satis est.
I can not.	Non possum non.
yes this will not be enough help.	Etiam hoc non erit satis auxilio.
there was need to know, what was needed to know.	scire opus erat, quid scire opus esset.
He is gone too.	Abiit etiam.
That is not to be done.	Quod non est faciendum.
But it will be .	Sed erit .
I need to see my dad.	Pater meus opus est videre.
It is not to be done.	Non est faciendum.
He got his advice.	Suum consilium obtinuit.
I told you to come yesterday.	Dixi te heri venire.
It's not what you want to be done.	Non quod vis fieri.
Maybe no one knew who it was.	Fortasse nemo scivit quis esset.
You must do this to me.	Hoc mihi debes facere.
Where was it?	Ubi id erat.
Unable to accept the possibility.	Posset accipere posse.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
But that's not great.	Sed non id magna.
He wanted to do everything.	Omnia facere voluit.
This would be	Hoc esset.
yes it is time.	Etiam tempus est.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
Usually this is not true.	Fere hoc verum non est.
No one said yes.	Sic dixit nemo.
so, so, so	sic, sic, sic.
No one was happy.	Nemo felix fuit.
I have it that way.	Habeo illuc.
What should he do? 	Quid faceret?
They are never sure.	Numquam certe sunt.
He did not know what happened.	Nesciebat quid.
Maybe there was no time.	Forte non erat tempus.
It was either him or him.	Vel erat ipsum vel illum.
She's never been without.	Nunquam sine illa fuit.
Something, to do, to do.	Aliquid, facere, facere.
He wants me to know where.	Non vult me ​​scire ubi.
For he did not think.	Non enim putabat.
They are not the thing.	Non sunt rem.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Forsitan quod factum est bonum.
It's too early for breakfast.	Sed nimis mane ad prandium.
I think there is something there.	Puto esse aliquid ibi.
and tomorrow again.	et cras iterum.
I'm never doing that again.	Im 'nunquam facio quod iterum.
He said that he did not know.	Dixit se nescire.
It was certainly good for us.	Ita certe bonus nobis fuit.
She already knows my room.	Iam illa cubiculum meum scit.
But not to be.	Sed non esse.
This may be necessary.	Hoc ut opus sit.
But he has not.	Sed non habet.
There was nothing she could do.	Non erat quod posset facere.
Tell her you're here.	Dic ei te hic esse.
No that ever was.	Nulla ut semper erat.
I will, soon.	Volo, mox.
How lucky she was.	Quam felix fuit.
These things are enough.	Haec satis sunt.
No' my problem.	Nulla' quaestio mea.
I also don't know.	Ego quoque non scio.
We've done it right.	Nos recte fecisti.
Perhaps you know this too.	Id quoque fortasse tu scis .
She was so happy.	Tam felix illa fuit.
Certainly, if you will.	Certe, si vis.
I never said who it was.	Numquam dixit quis esset.
Nothing else.	Nihil aliud.
It won't be easy yet.	Non erit facile tamen.
You are already there.	Iam ibi es.
I thought and thought.	Cogitavi et cogitavi.
I'd like to talk.	Loqui libet.
He always looks good to me.	Semper in me bonum spectat.
As it was said.	Ut dictum erat.
Now that's the same thing for us.	Nunc id ipsum est nobis.
It was so.	Sic erat.
This was well done.	Bene factum hoc fuit.
There will be nothing.	Nihil erit.
No, never alone.	Nemo, numquam solus.
He also doesn't want to.	Etiam non velit.
I wonder when that will happen.	Miror quando id erit.
The man did not want the same.	Noluit idem homo.
He is not himself, and	Non est ipse, et .
I have seen enough.	Satis vidi.
i'm really happy.	Sum vere felix.
But not all is well.	Sed bene non omnibus.
We have already already.	Jam jam habemus.
Yes that's great.	Etiam id enim magna.
A lot of money.	Multum pecuniae.
Yes, that was the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum erat.
He has no friends.	Amicos non habet.
He inquired of her.	Quaesivit eam.
I also need to cum.	Mihi quoque opus est ut cum.
I just want to be my husband.	EGO iustus volo ut sit vir meus.
It will be fine.	Bene erit.
Don't say it, please.	Noli ei dicere, quaeso.
Maybe she thought he would have one.	Fortasse putavit se habere unum.
Perhaps more today than ever.	Plus fortasse hodie quam umquam.
There is no time for nothing.	Nulla tempus nulla est.
I like to be busy.	Mihi placet esse occupatus.
He didn't understand what he said.	Non intellexit quid dixit.
I did both.	utrumque ego feci.
Don't act on it.	Non agere.
if not next year, year after.	si non proximo anno, anno post.
if necessary.	si necesse erit.
This is not good for us.	Non est hoc bonum nobis.
and he did it again.	et fecit iterum.
Maybe not tonight.	Forte non hac nocte.
And that's the plan.	Et id consilium.
I tried to talk with someone today.	Conatus est hodie apud aliquem loqui.
And this is what he does much.	Et hoc est quod multum facit.
You think.	Putas.
And much more than that.	Et multo quam.
Which is pretty great.	Quae satis magna.
You can buy.	Emere potes.
There is still nothing else to see.	Adhuc nihil est aliud videre.
I do everything.	facio omnia.
It's very likely.	Verisimile est illud.
It's not easy to go through.	Non est facile ire per.
He is a man.	Homo est.
I never had it before.	Numquam ante id habui.
You can't stop thinking.	Non potes prohibere cogitas.
But got one more.	Sed unum plus obtinuit.
The father loves him a lot.	Pater ei multum amat.
But that was the same thing.	Sed id ipsum erat.
Okay so much for that.	Bene tantum quod.
It was enough.	Satis erat.
I'll never do it.	Numquam id faciam.
That's what it's like.	Id cum illa simile est.
He could also do so.	Ipse etiam facerem.
He says to go.	Dicit ire.
This is nothing.	Hoc nihil est.
But he was also before.	Sed et erat ante.
This is important.	Hoc sit amet.
It was from zero.	Erat ex nulla.
He will always be there for me after one day.	Ibi mihi semper est post diem unum.
Now only in this article.	Nunc in dictum nisi.
I couldn't think of anything to say.	Non potui cogitare quid dicam.
The future is not certain.	Certum futurum non est.
This certainly is not possible.	Id certe fieri non potest.
This morning there was one.	Hoc mane unum erat.
I knew my plan as a child.	Sciebam consilium meum sicut puer.
Who will be, will be.	Quis erit, erit.
Now that's out now.	Nunc id nunc ex.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
But one thing is certain.	Unum tamen certum est.
There was something more.	Plus aliquid fuit.
We have breakfast.	Prandium habemus.
you can't do it.	id facere non potes.
All in all, it was pretty fun.	Omnino satis amet erat.
She did not know where she was now.	Nesciebat ubi nunc esset.
Well, certainly bad.	Bene, certe malum.
But but it is how.	Sed sed est quam.
But not like us.	Sed non sicut nos.
He thinks he is more than that.	Plus putat se esse quam illud.
I just don't play.	Modo non ludere.
help me yourself.	me ipsum adiuvet.
And so he did.	Et sic fecit.
Yes, it's fun to do.	Etiam, eius amet facere.
Maybe you were right.	Fortasse recte.
He refused to believe.	Noluit credere.
Let me speak.	Fac me loqui.
It is not possible.	Fieri non potest.
No longer his.	Non iam eius.
It's not a great idea.	Est magna ex non.
But it is not.	Sed non est.
But none but him.	Nulla sed ipsum nisi.
Here's the question.	Hic est quaestio.
This one is the first.	Hoc unum est primum.
.	.
I wanted to stay.	manere volui.
and nothing can hinder it.	et nihil prohibere potest.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
To be happy with yourself.	Ut sit amet ex ipsum.
Not always.	Non semper.
It doesn't always happen.	Fieri non semper.
Always up to this point.	Semper ad hoc.
You did not.	Non fecisti.
But that's not here.	Sed id non hic.
He already has.	Jam habet.
He can't talk.	Qui non potest dicere.
I thought I already know.	Putavi jam scire.
Do it this time.	Fac hoc tempore.
He is gone.	Abiit.
There was no one yet.	Nemo adhuc erat.
All things that are after him.	Omnia quae post se sunt.
Thus he could.	Sic potuit.
Before lunch, before lunch, before lunch.	Ante prandium, ante prandium, ante prandium.
But very well.	Sed valde bene.
But not quickly.	Sed non cito.
It's time to say great things.	Aliquam dictum magna enim.
Everything was there.	Omnia ibi erat.
She thought he was doing the right thing.	Putavit se rem recte agere.
We can't have it.	Id habere non possumus.
That's the only thing in it.	Id solum in.
Always got along with everyone.	Semper una cum omnibus obtinuit.
Say when you're ready.	Dic cum paratus sis.
This is only	Hoc tantum est.
We're in now.	Nunc in sumus.
Both	Utrumque .
It is the first time.	Primum tempus est.
I was in school.	In schola eram.
Certainly there was something else.	Certe quid aliud erat.
I never saw it before noon.	Numquam ante meridiem eam vidi.
I know how hard it is to be here.	Scio quam difficile sit hic esse.
So I don't say much.	Ita non multum dicam.
I know people like you.	Scio homines te.
You are this.	Hoc tu es.
We can do this now.	Hoc nunc facere possumus.
See you all in the morning.	Vide omnes mane.
It's time to say how to do it.	Aliquam dictum, quam id.
That's great either.	Ut vel magna.
can play this way.	Potest hoc modo ludere.
I don't need anymore.	Non opus habet amplius.
Not yet.	Non Nondum.
I don't like him.	Non amo illum.
Never let him down.	Sit numquam ipsum.
This will only stay there until morning.	Hoc modo erit ibi manere usque ad mane.
again he was a boy.	iterum puer erat.
That's some sort of thing.	Ut id aliquam nulla.
He refused to come home until morning.	Noluit venire domum usque mane.
He did not do this.	Hoc facere non fecit.
You said	Dixisti .
I don't know for sure.	Nescio certe.
Of this, if nothing else, it was certain.	De hoc, si nihil aliud, certum erat.
I think it's pretty good.	Puto satis bonum.
i have something to say.	aliquid habeo dicere.
Do this today.	Hoc fac hodie.
If of him, well.	Si de se, bene.
The problem can't be seen.	Quaestio non videri potest.
I love you too much.	Nimium amo te.
What I didn't know.	Quid ego nesciebam.
I need to know who she is.	Mihi opus est ut quae illa scit.
It was not done.	Non fuit factum.
You can say your name.	Nomen potes dicere.
To me at least that is.	Mihi certe hoc est.
I want to do this right now.	Hoc ipsum facere volo, nunc.
They are pretty much.	Satis multa sunt.
Maybe, maybe not.	Fortasse fortasse.
That's where it started.	Id ubi incepit.
I never thought this way.	Nunquam hoc modo putavi.
This can be seen in .	Hoc videri potest in .
Everything in him.	Omnia in eo.
We can't do it again.	Iterum facere non possumus.
That's it now.	Id nunc est.
It was hard for me to tell.	Mihi narrare difficile erat.
I have seen a lot of things.	Multum vidi.
Well you haven't yet.	Bene nondum habes.
Who do they like.	Qui facere ut libet.
You are not.	Non es.
The question is: no one wanted me to buy.	Quaestio est: nemo me emere voluit.
Something can be done today.	Hodie aliquid fieri potest.
No one comes.	Nemo venit.
She's always trying to stop me.	Illa semper me prohibere conatur.
I wish there was a lot to do.	Ut sit amet velit erat.
I don't need you.	Non opus est tibi.
I never know what will happen.	Numquam non quid futurum sit.
No one but us.	Nemo nos, sed.
I am not.	Non sum ego.
If any one has seen yet.	Si quis adhuc vidit.
He just does.	Ille iustus facit.
That's not good.	Id non.
It was time to speak.	Tempus erat dicere.
You are a just man.	Homo es iustus.
But it has not been said.	Sed non dictum est.
Thursday night if possible.	Nocte si fieri potuit.
They are all men.	Omnes homines sunt.
Maybe not only.	Aliquam non nisi.
Great game.	Magna ipsum.
He thought someone could help me.	Putabat aliquis qui me adiuvare posset.
It is important to say that.	Aliquam sit amet dictum quam.
To save some time.	Ut tempus aliquam nisi.
Maybe next year.	Fortasse anno proximo.
just yet.	mox adhuc.
My advice is what you do.	Meum consilium est quod tu facis.
I've heard it now.	Audivi modo.
I think you're here to stay.	Puto te hic manere.
there is one	unus est .
But before him.	Sed id ipsum ante.
But not at all.	Sed non nulla.
It's not a thing.	Non res est.
It is not .	Non est .
A man ought to say something.	Vir aliquid dicere debet.
But that's just as important.	Sed ut magna id est.
Yes, this is just as important.	Ita, haec tam magna.
Tomorrow that's how.	Cras id quam.
I always thought it would be me.	Semper fore me putavi.
which work was necessary.	quam opus erat.
Look at this.	Hoc vide.
It's almost over now.	Fere per nunc.
For even a year.	Vel anno.
It's a bad idea.	Male sit amet.
That's right, it will be the same.	SIC, Idem erit.
I wonder how this was done.	Miror quomodo id factum sit.
Never call me now.	Nunquam me nunc.
I wish it were me.	Utinam mihi esset.
He did not think that he was.	Non putabat se esse.
I? 	EGO?
It's not like you.	Non est sicut tu.
I have something in it.	Habeo aliquid in.
I know nothing there.	Nihil ibi scio.
He wanted to talk to him.	Voluit ei loqui.
I want to know what she wants.	Scire volo quid sibi velit.
It was always going to happen.	Certum erat semper futurum.
I believe they can do better.	credo melius facere posse.
I can hear you now.	Nunc te audire possum.
But he did not say either.	Sed vel non dixit.
If anyone could do the job, it was him.	Si quis posset officium facere, eius erat.
You just go with it.	Vos iustus ire cum illo.
I need something.	Mihi aliquid opus est.
I've only got it.	Ego solus obtinuit.
I don't know what to say about this.	De hoc quid dicam nescio.
We can't live like this any longer.	Sic iam vivere non possumus.
You don't want me.	Non vis me.
I like it very much.	Valde mihi placet.
There is no question.	Quaestio non est.
Maybe to be okay.	Forsitan ad esse bene.
I never used to do that.	Numquam facere solebat.
It was very late.	Sero admodum factum est.
You have a great time, anyone.	Es tempus magna, quis.
Certainly to me indeed.	Mihi quidem certe.
.	.
Too bad for him.	Illum nimis male.
It is nothing else.	Nihil aliud est.
But this is not yet.	Sed hoc nondum est.
it is still true, even to this day.	verum adhuc, usque hodie verum.
I still feel so badly.	Ego tamen sic male sentio.
You also don't want to be.	Tu quoque esse non vis.
In this way he saw many things or many things.	Hoc modo vidit multa vel multa.
He didn't want to think about it.	Noluit cogitare de illo.
It will be .	Erit .
You know before time.	Scis ante tempus.
I could not see you.	Te non potui.
But only you know.	Sed solum scis.
My father was certainly not at home.	Pater certe domi non erat.
he left his job and his wife.	officium suum reliquit et uxorem suam.
And if you don't like it	Et si non placet .
It will be pretty good.	Satis erit bonum.
I have to travel.	Habeo iter in.
You can help me here.	Hic me adiuvare potes.
He only behaves like one.	Ille solum se habet sicut unum.
I may or may not wish.	Ut vel non velit.
I forgot.	Oblitus sum.
You don't have this at all.	Hoc omnino non habes.
Everything will never be okay.	Numquam omnia bene.
I will tell you.	Ego dicam tibi.
Yes, it was not before.	Etiam non erat ante.
He said that he had.	Dixit se habere.
But it is his thing.	Sed res eius est.
Kind of pretty fun but well done.	Genus satis amet sed bene factum.
But he did not want to think about this now.	Sed de hoc nunc cogitare noluit.
This doesn't seem like hard.	Hoc simile non videtur esse difficile.
You must do this.	Hoc tibi faciendum est.
and in some way does this work.	et aliquo modo hoc opus facit.
That's how it was.	Ut id quam erat.
Soon they all went.	Mox omnes ad.
It can't be good for him.	Non potest ei bonum esse.
I've never been there.	Nunquam ibi fui.
But this is no longer true.	Sed hic iam non est verum.
But he was unwilling to give it.	Sed nolebat ei dare.
Too big and too busy.	Nimis magna et occupatus est.
You just did it in time.	Vos iustus in tempore fecit.
She never let him down.	Quae numquam eum.
And there he is.	Et ibi est.
I like you this way.	Placet tibi hoc modo.
You'd like to know.	Scire velis.
I don't think so.	Non ita cogitas.
This is not likely yet.	Hoc tamen verisimile non est.
We never have time.	Numquam tempus habemus.
You can do everything if you want.	Omnia potes, si vis.
Do it quickly.	Fac cito.
I will not tell you.	Non dicam tibi.
and it is likely that he does.	et verisimile est, facit.
Even now it was not.	Etiam non nunc erat.
That's all I need at the same time.	Id omnes simul opus est.
it would be nothing.	nihil esset.
There is almost nothing.	Fere nihil est.
But still, that's the same thing.	Sed tamen id ipsum ut.
So that's where it is.	Ita ut ubi sit.
Maria can't be.	Non potest esse maria.
a.	a.
Certainly not all.	Certe non omnes.
I would not live without her.	Sine illa vivere nolui.
I need to see it.	Mihi opus est ad eam.
That's a no it was.	Ut a erat nulla.
I just couldn't stop.	Modo non potuit prohibere.
Say yes you want.	Etiam dicere vis.
Not good, not bad.	Non bonum, non malum.
Yes it is not.	Ita non est.
and so he will.	et sic vult.
I've never heard this before.	Nunquam ante hoc audivi.
He doesn't talk much about himself.	Non multum de se loquitur.
He didn't want to be alone again.	Noluit iterum solus esse.
But that's what we have.	Sed id quod habemus.
And it is a great question.	Et magna quaestio est.
My boy is.	Meus est puer.
It would be better now.	Nunc melius esset.
But it was difficult.	Sed difficile erat.
And yet it is not enough.	Et adhuc parum est.
I'm there.	Ibi sum.
Here all.	Haec omnia.
Why	Cur .
But he himself understood.	Sed ipse intellexit.
He can't even speak.	Ne loqui quidem potest.
Really not something.	Vere non est aliquid.
Someone has left it here.	Aliquis hic eam reliquit.
and he owes it to himself.	et ipse debet.
What she plans to do now.	Quid nunc facere illa cogitat.
This is the future, and we are in it.	Hoc est futurum, et nos in eo sumus.
Yes that's the same thing.	Etiam id ipsum.
He can't get a bad decision.	Malum consilium habere non potest.
Not yet	Nondum .
But it was well.	Sed bene erat.
You know we can live.	Scis nos posse vivere.
But it is very similar.	Sed nimis similis est.
I can do this.	Hoc facere possum.
You just did it again.	Tu modo iterum fecisti.
There is something wrong here.	Male hic aliquid est.
I would like to see him here.	Illum huc videre vellem.
He did not say.	Non dixit.
But not much time.	Sed non multum tempus.
I'm not here anymore.	Non sum hic amplius.
It's time for someone to love him.	Aliquam quis ipsum enim.
They are really very good.	Vere valde bona sunt.
Now it is certain.	Nunc certum est.
They are not men.	Non homines.
I could not even speak.	Ne loqui quidem potui.
And now is a good time.	Et nunc tempus bonum.
He likes to go.	Velit ut.
Its not great.	Eius non magna.
He said good.	Dixit bonum.
We can't believe it.	Non possumus nos id credere.
But he wants some.	Sed id aliquam velit.
The father was there.	Pater erat ibi.
No problem, but no.	Nulla quaestio, nulla sed.
It's not with me.	Est ne apud me.
You're only traveling tonight.	Tu tantum hac nocte iter.
He did not think so, but.	Non putabat, sed.
What you said is true.	Verum est quod dixisti.
Tomorrow on a great basis.	Cras in magna ex.
It was something else.	Aliud fuit.
It's good for you.	Bonum est tibi.
Now I can speak.	Nunc possum dicere.
I can give or receive.	possum dare vel accipere.
But he could not say enough.	Sed non potuit satis dicere.
No as stated.	Nulla ut dictum est.
And indeed that was true.	Et quidem, quod verum erat.
He could not think.	Non potuit cogitare.
I said so much to me.	Dixi tantum ut me.
Yes but no save.	Etiam sed nulla nisi.
What a good man will do.	Quid facturus est vir bonus.
I didn't forget it.	Oblitus non est.
We are his people.	Homines eius sumus.
She probably wasn't married after that.	Et verisimile non erat post eam uxorem.
I know them all.	Novi omnes.
He thought.	Putabat.
I want him to find a house.	Volo eum invenire domum.
Maybe again soon.	Forsitan mox iterum.
You can do nothing more here.	Nihil amplius hic facere potes.
you must be.	esse debes.
May it be with us.	Sit nobiscum.
He does what he wants.	Facit quod vult.
I forgot to give him lunch yesterday.	Oblitus sum heri dare ei prandium.
It was like you said.	Fuit sicut dixisti.
No time is available.	Nulla sit amet tempus est.
But now it's him.	Sed nunc ipsum.
Yes, better option.	Etiam, melius bene.
He must be here already.	Iam hic esse debet.
You just get it.	Tu modo ut ei.
I think he can be seen.	Videri se posse puto.
I think you still know what it is.	Puto adhuc quid est.
This certainly is so.	Hoc certe ita est.
But that is the time.	Sed ut tempus est.
Certainly not in the near future.	Certe non in proximo.
It should be good.	Sit bonum.
There was none or nothing.	Nulla vel nisi erat.
And it will be true.	Et verum erit.
Alone, truly.	Solus, vere.
I was lucky.	Fui felix.
i thought that would be fun.	Putabam ut sit amet.
Which can only be good.	Quod non potest esse nisi bonum.
He is good.	Ille est bonus.
It is always.	Est semper.
This time not.	Hoc tempus non.
Not here, not now, not so.	Non hic, non nunc, non sic.
A just man	Homo iustus.
That which is his is yours.	Quod suum est, tuum est.
He left again.	Reliquit adhuc.
I can't believe you do.	Facere te possum credere.
We've been together for a long, long time.	Simul sumus diu, diu.
I did not.	Non feci.
They are almost certainly still alive.	Fere certe adhuc sunt.
No one seems to know why that is.	Nemo cur id sit scire videtur.
But that's not to be.	Id non esse autem.
Where do you want to go and when.	Vis quo ire et quando.
He said he had more to do with someone else.	Dixit se id amplius facere cum aliquo.
But rightly so.	Sed ita recte.
You're not alone.	Te non solum.
It's so hard to talk.	Loqui tam difficile est.
One if you can.	Unum si potes.
He loves to talk.	Loqui amat ille.
That can be done here.	Quod fieri hic potest.
She thought it would be better.	Illa melius fore, putabat.
He wants to say something.	Dicere aliquid vult.
Maybe you never will.	Forsitan numquam erit.
Breakfast is mine.	Prandium est meum.
You don't need to stay.	Non debes manere.
This is not true now.	Hoc modo verum non est.
I've done this post.	Ego feci post hoc.
You can do it all.	Potes id totum.
I have seen you.	vidi te.
All this	Hoc totum .
He was also one of them.	Etiam quis ex erat.
Well you can now.	Bene iam potes.
I love these days.	Haec dies amo.
But that's the time for him.	Ut sed tempus ipsum.
He didn't want to think about anything.	Noluit cogitare de aliquo.
Everything I want to do with you.	Omnia volo tecum facere.
And it is correct indeed.	Et recte quidem est.
There will probably be time.	Probabiliter tempus non erit.
I know your name.	Scio nomen.
I was not long after.	nec multo post fui.
He's just a guy.	Hic iustus est guy.
We can't always stay the same.	Idem semper manere non possumus.
I can do everything for all.	Omnia possum omnibus.
I'm good in school.	In schola bonus sum.
However, he could not stop.	Tamen non potuit prohibere.
i never saw.	numquam vidi.
You can't go.	Ire non potes .
I don't know why anyone is going to do it.	Nescio cur quis id facturus sit.
It was a good thing, too.	Bona res erat, etiam.
No one wants to be in it.	Nulla in ipsum velit.
This certainly was.	Hoc certe fuit.
we cannot live like this.	sic vivere non possumus.
Which in itself was enough.	Quod in se satis erat.
That's already done.	Quod iam factum est.
Well, it's different.	Bene, aliud est.
We never know how long.	Numquam nos quam diu.
Yes it certainly was with me.	Ita certe apud me fuit.
I can't really talk right now.	Non possum vere loqui nunc.
It is never okay.	Numquam bene.
No but for you.	Nulla sed enim.
I don't know myself.	Nescio, ipse.
You are still working on this.	Adhuc in hoc opus es.
Even as before.	Etiam ut ipsum ante.
sorry for what happened.	Paenitet me quod factum est.
I don't think it's possible to help.	Non videtur posse eam adiuvare.
Yes it is possible.	Ita fieri potest.
There's no time in it.	In id nulla nunc.
Maybe that was great.	Aliquam id magna erat.
He was very sure about himself.	De se valde certus erat.
I don't know how he thought so.	Nescio quomodo non ita putabat.
I want to do it tonight.	Hac nocte facere volo.
one after all.	unus post omnes.
To be true to you.	Ut sit tibi verum.
i saw it yesterday.	in eo vidi heri.
If you need to do this, do it.	Si hoc facere debes, facias.
Never really better.	Numquam vere melius.
Almost after him.	Fere post eum.
All this is between us.	Hoc totum inter nos est.
And it can be done today.	Et potest hodie fieri.
I made my way to the office.	Iter ad officium meum feci.
It's not like it.	Hoc non est simile ei.
The righteous is not prepared.	Non paratus est iustus.
Definitely don't like it.	Certus non placet.
You did this for the first time.	Tu primum hoc.
I doubt it will happen.	Dubito futurum.
I don't believe it to be so.	Non credo ita esse.
That's something.	Id est aliquid est.
I, however.	Ego tamen.
He left at least too much.	Reliquit certe nimium.
I'm not sure anymore either.	Non sum certus amplius vel.
I will not do so.	Non ita faciam.
That's a lot of fun.	Ut sit amet dictum est.
It seemed.	Videbatur.
I will not do it again like this.	Non faciam iterum simile hoc.
But not much longer.	Sed non multo diutius.
I see to know.	Scire video.
Same thing to me.	Idem mihi.
I feel a lot better too.	Multum etiam melius sentio.
Maybe it was time.	Aliquam id tempus erat.
It was not my first trip.	Primum iter non fuit.
Thus he had.	Sic habuit.
He did everything, but it was enough.	Omnia fecit, sed satis fuit.
He did not think correctly.	Non recte putabat.
I can help you, you know.	Ego te adiuvare possum, tu scis.
I had a dog.	Canem habui.
I don't feel bad.	Non male sentio.
Well this has been done.	Bene hoc factum est.
I just want you home.	Ego iustus volo te in domum suam.
in who but how.	In quis nisi quam.
It's so good for me.	Tam bona est mihi.
For tomorrow that is.	Cras id est enim.
But that was difficult.	Sed id difficile erat.
I need your help.	Auxilium tuum mihi opus est.
Evil, evil, evil.	Malum, malum, malum.
No, that is not.	Nec, quod non est.
To come and see is not what you need.	Venire et videre non est quod debes.
He did not do everything.	Non omnia fecit.
The question seems just as important.	Quaestio tam magna videtur.
As I have not said before.	Ut non dictum ante.
I just don't know how.	Modo nescit quomodo.
I really don't think I could.	Ego vere cogitare non potui.
We are all men.	Omnes homines sumus.
That it was not.	Quod non esset.
But perhaps he will.	Sed fortasse velit.
I didn't say anything at the time.	Non dixi aliquid tempore.
If anyone could, he could.	Si quis posset, posset.
As you said, you don't have time.	Ut dixisti, tempus non habes.
I told him not to come.	Dixi eum non venire.
He is not his father.	Non est pater eius.
It certainly could not have been done.	Fieri non potuit certe.
But this is not true.	Sed hoc non est.
So he got everything.	Ita omnia obtinuit.
Would that it was not.	Utinam non esset.
It's long enough.	Satis diu est.
He is there in all things.	Ibi in omnibus est.
Almost everyone loves her.	Fere omnes eam amat.
It's just hard to find.	Suus 'iustus invenire difficile.
I want .	Volo .
That was the same thing.	Erat id ipsum.
It's likely too.	Verisimile est eum quoque.
What should he do? 	Quid faceret?
It is necessary to speak.	Loqui necesse est.
I believe this is his.	Hoc est suum credo.
Yes that's the same for you.	Etiam id ipsum enim.
Yes, but it was.	Etiam sed erat erat.
I think what he says.	Puto quod dicit.
It seemed pretty much a lot of money.	Pecuniae satis multum videbatur.
that is you.	id est te.
And only better since.	Et solum melius ex quo.
You are not with me.	Non es mecum.
I can't think of this.	Non possum hoc cogitare.
I was not from me, you know.	ex me non fui, tu scis.
He also doesn't want him.	Etiam nec ipsum velit.
I could not say anything.	Non potui aliquid dicere.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Aliquam non velit.
I often doubt.	saepe dubito.
Not enough, however.	Non satis, sed.
Rightly said.	Recte dixit.
thirty years ago e.	Triginta annos e.
He gave us a question.	Quaestionem nobis dedit.
That's what it seems to me.	Id quod mihi videtur.
It's time to never let out.	Aliquam ut numquam ex.
We can help you in this too.	In hoc quoque te adiuvare possumus.
The film is great.	In sit amet magna.
But perhaps rightly so.	Sed fortasse recte.
He was sure he could do it.	Certus erat hoc facere posse.
He didn't eat much, he didn't talk much.	Non multum comedit, non multum loqui.
Not just people.	Non solum homines.
Maybe or some other than that.	Aliquam vel aliquam quam.
But not that.	Sed non id.
You can do whatever you want.	Facere potes quod vis.
Don't do this again.	Non hoc iterum.
Hear not evil, do not see evil.	Noli audire malum, noli videre malum.
There is always something more in it.	Semper aliquid plus in.
Not long yet.	Non diu tamen.
We're in the office.	In officium sumus.
Not to him.	Non sibi.
A little help now would be a good thing.	Parum auxilium nunc bona res esset.
But he does not speak here.	Sed hic non loquitur.
There is no time for it.	Nulla id tempus ipsum.
I don't want you with me.	Nolo te mecum.
That's not only for me, but for all.	Id non solum mihi, sed omnibus.
There is no plan.	Non est consilium.
I only want to talk to you.	Tantum volo tecum loqui.
But not much else.	Sed non multum aliud.
as always I was in the morning.	ut semper mane fui.
I could not speak.	loqui non potui.
That perhaps wasn't.	Quod fortasse non erat.
It would seem that this is not so.	Videtur hoc non ita esse.
Do whatever you want.	Fac quod vis.
This work is done.	Hoc opus est.
And he understood that.	Quod et intellexit.
It could be really good.	Posset esse vere bonus.
I don't like looking.	Ego vultus non amo.
He wanted to do something, and now he did it.	Aliquid facere voluit et nunc fecit.
You want to play well.	Ludere bene velis.
There was no need for him to speak.	Nihil opus erat ei dicere.
This is about my work so much.	Hoc est fere opus meum tantum.
He should not.	Non debet.
this I have to say.	hoc habeo dicere.
Now who is before him.	Nunc quis ante ipsum.
But he could not do it.	Sed id facere non potuit.
the dog got it.	canis eam obtinuit.
But that's none of it yet.	Sed id nulla sed.
I want both at the same time.	Utrumque simul volo.
To do this.	Facere id.
Go do it again.	Ire fac illud.
That this may be true.	Quod ut verum sit.
He just can't do it.	Ille iustus facere non potest.
And you again.	Et tu iterum.
We just talk about ourselves.	Modo nos de nobis loqui.
That he was alone.	Id erat solum.
There is no way to love yourself.	Nulla ut ipsum.
Mary to him.	Mariae ad eum.
Which when he did not do it, he did it.	Quod cum non faceret, fecit eam.
I don't like this.	Non placet hoc.
He was three.	Tres erat.
It is good.	Bonum est.
I am not sure if it is mine or yours.	Non sum certus si mea est, vel tua.
All you need is to know where it is.	Omnes opus est scire ubi sit.
Soon it will be in all.	Mox in omnibus erit.
Nothing is great.	Nulla in magna est.
You can't think about how he did it at all.	Potes cogitare quomodo id omnino non fecerit.
What's up with him?	Quid cum illo.
He was there.	ibi erat.
But it was too much for me.	Sed nimium mihi erat.
They are pretty much the same.	Fere idem sunt.
You both are very happy.	Utrumque tibi sit amet ipsum.
It is possible, but not probable.	Fieri potest, sed non probabile.
But she never did.	Quae numquam sed.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon enough.	Fortasse non hodie, fortasse non cras, sed mox satis.
It's time to go.	Aliquam erat ut.
He could not live.	Vivere non potuit.
Nothing in school has ever been difficult.	Nihil in schola ei difficile umquam fuit.
This never has, never will.	Hoc numquam habet, numquam erit.
But time to go now.	Sed tempus ut nunc.
Yes they are not.	Ita non sunt.
It really means a lot!.	Is vere est multum !.
He didn't want to talk.	Nolebat loqui.
It was true.	Verum erat.
It's a lot for me.	Multum mihi est.
This year is something new.	Hoc anno aliquid novi est.
I don't believe it.	Id non credo.
But he cannot think.	Sed cogitare non potest.
If not, perhaps not.	Si non, fortasse non.
No, but it was always.	Nulla sed semper erat.
But there was only one.	Sed non erat nisi.
It never happened until that day.	Numquam eius nisi ad illum diem factum est.
I am not alone indeed.	Non sum solus quidem.
You did not do this.	Hoc tu non fecisti.
Well, now do it again.	Bene, nunc iterum fac.
He didn't want to win this.	Noluit hoc vincere.
I know this happens often.	Id saepe fieri scio.
But there was no time.	Sed tempus non erat.
Better late than never, but here we are.	Melius sero quam numquam, hic autem sumus.
Certainly to me.	Mihi certe.
But what you need to know is true.	Sed quod scire debes verum est.
He wanted me to be certain.	Certum erat me velle.
But that was before.	Sed id ante.
We can't do it.	Non possumus facere.
What has been done.	Quod factum est.
He got nothing.	Nihil obtinuit.
But let's be honest there is none.	Sed sit amet nulla est.
I always wanted one.	Unum semper volui.
It's not my name.	Non est nomen meum.
This was something else entirely.	Aliud omnino hoc fuit.
But neither was it said.	Sed nec dictum est.
That's only with me.	Id solum apud me est.
Which yes is not true.	Quod ita non est verum.
Well, it's fine.	Bene, bene est.
He has not.	Non habet.
And never better.	Et numquam melius.
That's where it came from.	Id ubi ex.
I'll tell you something else.	Dicam autem aliud.
You can play with it.	Ludere cum eo potes.
You are there	Ibi tu es .
And this is not good.	Et hoc non est bonum.
If it will be, it will be.	Si suus erit, erit.
there he did it again.	ibi iterum fecit.
You are better.	Melius es.
This is the man who loves you.	Hic est homo qui te amat.
He left her there.	Ibi eam reliquit.
Nothing like it has ever happened before.	Nihil simile umquam ante factum est.
If, as he says.	Si, ut dicit.
Never travel alone.	Nunquam solus iter.
He knew everything about him.	Sciebat omnia de eo.
Not today, but soon.	Non hodie, sed mox.
This is no longer there.	Hoc iam non est.
All by chance.	Omnes forte.
It is good.	Bene est.
It's only you and you.	Est solum te et te.
His work is different.	Aliud est opus eius.
But not just where to do it.	Sed non solum ubi id.
But he refused to stay.	Sed noluit manere.
It was time for us.	Tempus erat nobis.
he does .	facit .
If you are not, you are not well.	Si non es, bene non es.
Thus you said.	Sic dixisti.
This did not succeed.	Hoc non obtinuit.
Why didn't you tell me.	Cur non dixisti mihi.
You don't have to do this.	Non habes hoc facere.
This can be	Hoc potest esse .
And now I have.	Et nunc habeo.
You can say whatever you want.	Dicere potes quod vis.
As always.	Ut semper quam.
He knows and loves things well.	Res bene novit et amat.
I have nothing else.	Nihil aliud habeo.
But here it is.	Hic est, sed.
I don't feel a little.	Non parum sentio.
The man came.	Venit homo.
Never like this.	Numquam sic.
You can't be certain what will happen now.	Certum esse iam non potes quid futurum sit.
I am not afraid to say that.	Non vereor dicere.
Nothing to do with it.	Nihil ad rem.
But yet there was none.	Sed sed nulla erat.
I could do nothing about him.	de illo nihil potui.
I haven't eaten till dinner today!	Hodie non comedit usque ad prandium!.
I totally forgot that until now.	Prorsus oblitus sum quod usque nunc.
Sure indeed.	Certus quidem.
You are very good to help me.	Tu es valde bonus ut me adiuvet.
It will be hard to stop now.	Nunc difficile erit prohibere.
Unless you don't love yourself.	Nisi non ipsum.
Now I have.	Nunc habeo.
See how it is better.	Vide quomodo melius.
Maybe you're lucky.	Fortasse sis felix.
Nothing can be seen to do.	Nihil facere videri potest.
He is ready.	Paratus est.
I will do my job.	Ego faciam officium meum.
He ought to be alone.	Solus esse debet.
You can be with me.	Apud me potes esse.
He says nothing when he seems to say all things.	Nihil dicit cum videtur omnia dicere.
I told you that is true.	Dixi vobis quod verum est.
You have school in the morning.	Scholam mane habes.
was .	erat .
It will not always be so.	Sic semper non erit.
Would like to see her.	Esset ut eam videre.
It started poorly.	Incepit male.
He looked great.	Vidit magna.
Maybe this was the first time.	Fortasse hoc primum fuit.
and what you did.	et quod feceris.
No one does it for you.	Nemo id pro.
And it's done this week.	Et hac septimana factum est.
And perhaps it would be better not to know.	Et fortasse melius esset nescire.
They are not quite the same.	Non satis idem sunt.
If only there was something.	Si modo aliquid erat.
But see here.	Sed vide hic.
See what he did.	Vide quid ille fecerit.
She gave you to us.	Illa te nobis dedit.
But there was something about it.	Fuisse de eo aliquid, sed.
He needs someone to help him.	Ipse debet aliquem adiuvare ad se.
Maybe you like this.	Forsitan hoc simile.
You'll never know it.	Numquam id scire.
What is possible? 	Quid fieri potest?
i want you.	ego te volo.
It was his.	Eius erat.
I have to listen to him.	Eum habeo audire ei.
And not great.	Et non magna.
Nothing to do with this.	Nihil ad hoc.
I need to go now.	Ego nunc opus est mihi ire.
I just couldn't give it up.	Modo non potuit eam dare.
Unless someone.	Nisi quis.
I did this yesterday.	Hoc heri feci.
I could not do this.	hoc facere non potui.
It has nothing to say.	Nihil habet quod dicam.
.	.
To find a house.	Invenire domum.
Everything's great right now.	Omnia magna nunc.
You are his father.	Pater eius es.
That in itself is not good.	Quod in se non est bonum.
Well done to you.	Bene est tibi.
I didn't want the money at all wrong.	Pecuniam omnino male nolui.
I can't go.	Non possum ire.
I see what you're after.	Video quid sis post.
Or the Father.	Vel Pater.
Boston has a similar experience.	Boston habet simile.
All in one.	Omnia in una.
This was a great time.	Tempus erat magna hac.
Too often.	Nimis saepe.
You can't just want to be in business.	Non potes tantum velle in rem.
But he doesn't want him.	Sed non ipsum velit.
That's a great thing.	Magna res est id.
This is always important.	Magna semper hac.
i'm too happy.	nimium felix sum.
There was something wrong here.	Aliquid hic mali fuit.
She's already there for you.	Jam illa tibi.
It is nothing else.	Nihil aliud est.
What you'd like to understand.	Quod velis intelligere.
You are what you are.	Tu quod es.
I am indebted	Debeo .
There he saw something.	Ibi aliquid vidit.
And perhaps this is good.	Et fortasse hoc bonum est.
It's okay not to know what to say.	Bene est nescire quid dicam.
That is, unless you happen to be me.	Id est, nisi forte me.
I don't like this.	Hoc non placet.
It's time to get some cum.	Aliquam id aliquam cum.
and he has a plan.	et consilium habet.
He did better.	Melius fecit.
But this was said only.	Sed id dictum nisi.
You can say.	Potes dicere.
Much work has been done.	Multum opus factum est.
Almost everything is good.	Fere omnibus hoc bonum est.
It was great too.	Etiam magna erat.
Which does not seem to be the case.	Quod ita esse non videtur.
I just need it.	Ego iustus opus est.
But no one knows.	Nemo autem scit.
It is too much.	Nimis est.
But that's one thing.	Id sed unum.
He is not talking now.	Non modo loquitur.
All I can do is through me.	Omnia per me facere non possum.
That's where I need it.	Id ubi opus est.
Maybe it was always time.	Aliquam semper tempus erat.
We are not like you.	Non sumus sicut tu.
I think we trust him.	Puto nos ei credere.
yes I'm not the kind to talk to.	Etiam non sum genus de me loqui.
No time no now.	Nulla nec tempus nunc.
but if you want to stay, stay.	sed si vis manere, mane.
If it doesn't work, it's a problem.	Si opus non facit, quaestio est.
I don't even know that.	Ne id quidem scio.
If you get what you want it can be done for sure.	Si id quod vis fieri certe potest.
You have to know what you want.	Scire habes quod vis.
I think that's possible.	Id puto posse.
A good man, a bad father.	Vir bonus, pater mali.
So now	Sic nunc .
Well, maybe not in the near future.	Bene, fortasse non in proximo futurum.
All at the same time.	Omnia in tempore simul.
I think it's him.	Puto illum.
I could always be.	Semper potui.
This truly is .	Hoc vere est .
You can do this better.	Hoc melius facere potes.
How can it be done.	Quomodo fieri potest.
There was something to it.	Ad id aliquid erat.
So it is.	Ita est.
They are the same.	Idem sunt.
it cannot be seen by anyone.	videri ab aliquo non potest.
You've done a lot for me.	Multum mihi fecisti.
This is quite probable.	Hoc est satis probabile.
It was always easy.	Facile semper fuit.
That's not how.	Ut non quam.
but he came alone.	sed solus venit.
But there is no future.	Sed non est futurum.
Now no one wants it.	Nunc id nulla velit.
Now I got out of this.	Nunc ut ex hoc obtinuit.
But it is not seen.	Sed non videtur.
No one comes here.	Nemo huc venit.
If not, well too.	Si non sunt, bene quoque.
I can't hear you.	Non possum te audire.
Unless there is another.	Nisi aliud est.
I don't like you.	Non tibi placet.
He did the same.	Hoc idem fecit.
But still happy.	Sed tamen felix.
That's okay.	Illud bene est.
That's the same thing now.	Id ipsum nunc.
You have nothing.	Nihil habes.
Someone or something that wasn't her.	Aliquis vel aliquid quod non erat eius.
He did a lot for me.	Multum mihi fecit.
But it was not the same.	Sed non ipsum erat.
must be done.	Faciendum est.
that I would do.	id facerem.
It is not good.	Non est bonum.
No one is none.	Nulla quis nulla est.
He was with me in school.	In schola mecum erat.
It is not the same at all.	Idem omnino non est.
I don't know what nationality.	Nescio quid genus.
He has .	Habet .
even with you.	etiam apud te.
But never forgets how to win.	Sed numquam oblitus est quam vincere.
He didn't know anymore.	Nesciebat amplius.
And things started to happen.	Et res incepit fieri.
And he did it very well.	Fecit, et optime.
That was true good.	Quod erat verum bonum.
Why so .	Quare sic .
He is speaking.	Loquitur.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
He seemed very busy.	Valde occupatus videbatur.
think about me.	de me esse puto.
It seemed too easy.	Nimis facile videbatur.
I'm glad that it is so.	Gaudeo quod ita sit.
I've never seen this one before.	Numquam ante id quis.
Better not.	Melius non.
For this he ought to give all his counsel.	Ad hoc debet totum consilium dare.
I don't want to go home.	Domum ire nolo.
Yes, it was not.	Etiam nec erat.
Not often, but enough.	Non saepe, sed satis.
He did nothing to him.	Nihil ei non fecit.
We can do this.	Id fieri possumus.
It is very easy to speak.	Valde facile est loqui.
He was very happy.	Valde felix erat.
No one seemed to be there.	Nemo ibi esse videbatur.
Everything is still.	Omnia adhuc.
I always wanted to go there.	Ibi semper ire volui.
It is difficult, but not possible.	Difficile est, sed fieri non potest.
Maybe not great before.	Aliquam non magna ante.
I can't do this anymore.	Hoc amplius facere non possum.
He was mine.	Meus erat.
But neither is he himself.	Sed nec ipsum.
It was his race.	Eius genus esset.
I think we've done pretty well.	Puto nos satis bene fecisse.
But, I beg you.	Sed, quaeso.
I'd better go.	Melius ire vellem.
What is it to me.	Quid sit mihi.
Look at yourself.	Vide te ipsum.
Well, it's better late than never.	Bene, melius est sero quam numquam.
And the whole thing is evil.	Et totum malum est.
A little over a year ago.	De anno, paulo.
He loves her there.	Ibi eam amat.
I want him to be here.	Eum hic esse volo.
Got time to talk to her.	Tempus obtinuit ad eam loqui.
He said he would talk to me again.	Dixit se iterum me loqui.
That too.	Id quoque.
But see.	Sed vide.
He refused to say that he could not.	Noluit dicere non posse.
And there was another thing too.	Erat autem aliud quoque.
But for me.	Sed mihi.
I do not know the name.	Nomen nescio.
No one has time for him.	Nulla quis tempus ipsum.
And I can't get it.	Et non potest eam accipere.
Do yourself as you do.	Fac te ipsum ut facias.
I can't do this.	Non possum hoc facere.
I don't know anything else.	Aliud non novi.
I neither believe nor believe.	Nec credo nec credo.
I saw myself.	Vidi ipse.
Too busy .	Occupatus .
It's a lot of time.	Multum temporis est.
He was a good boy.	Bonus puer erat.
It has not been done.	Non id factum est.
I just need one thing, another.	Modo aliud opus, aliud.
I hope this would help.	Spero fore ut hoc adiuvet.
He said that he was not there.	Dixit se ibi non esse.
Maybe that's how great.	Aliquam id magna quam.
All I can do is get you done.	Omnia possum te facere quod vis fieri.
He does very well.	Optime facit.
He never knew why.	Cur nunquam scivit.
Now back to reality.	Nunc ad rem.
Maybe something else.	Aliud fortasse.
I was alone.	Solus eram.
It is a pleasure to have a job.	Felix est officium habere.
It could not have been better.	Melius esse non potuit.
Much better yet.	Multo tamen melius.
I don't quite know what to do.	Non satis scio quid faciam.
You know this is happening.	Scis hoc fieri.
You are not yet ready.	Nondum paratus es.
I had the money.	Pecuniam habui.
And now it was his.	Et nunc eius fuit.
Well you already know.	Bene iam scis.
I could not see it.	Non potui videre eam.
I can't think of another one.	Unum aliud factum cogitare non possum.
Maybe it was time.	Aliquam nunc erat.
This is going to be really good.	Hoc vere bene futurum est.
But he was not, or was.	Sed non erat vel erat.
This cannot be true.	Hoc verum esse non potest.
It could be.	Posset esse.
and it was not well.	et non erat bene.
No one knows what they are.	Nemo scit quid sunt.
You'd be alone there.	Solus ibi esse velis.
The boy is like that.	Puer similis est.
You only be yourself, be yourself.	Tu modo esse te, esse te ipsum.
I can't do anything about it.	Non possum aliquid de illo.
She did not come with us.	Nobiscum venire non illa.
You need to accept who you are.	Accipere te debes qui sis.
So he does nothing.	Ita nihil agit.
But not all.	Sed non omnia.
It was before the time.	Erat ante tempus.
I hope I will do better this next year.	Spero melius hoc proximo anno me facturum.
But what is this .	Sed quid hoc .
And the plan.	Et consilium.
It can be better.	Melius esse potest.
Only this type can do this.	Hoc solum genus hoc facere potest.
everyone speaks of him.	de eo omnes loquitur.
Now that's what I need.	Iam quod opus est.
But what if you can't buy one?	Sed quid, si non potes unum emere?
You can't deal with it.	Cum eo agere non potes.
I don't feel so.	Ita non sentio.
He could always do more.	Potuit semper plus.
It was mine to do.	Meum fuit hoc facere.
You are not great.	Non sunt tibi magna.
It's better for you.	Melius est tibi.
He who wants to stay here can stay here.	Qui hic manere vult, hic manere potest.
He was in that very thing.	In id ipsum erat.
First of all, time is not the same.	Ante omnia tempus non est idem.
i think it's bad.	Puto malum.
Today almost none.	Hodie fere nemo.
But that's how.	Sed id quam quam.
But that time was not.	Sed id tempus non erat.
No, that was great.	Nulla ut magna erat.
But that's what he wants.	Sed id velit quam.
I'm going to get one.	Eo ut unum.
I do not believe.	Non credo.
Yes that's one thing.	Etiam id unum.
That's how it comes to mind.	Id quomodo occurrit.
I want you to know that I am.	Volo te scire me esse.
Both are in you.	Utrumque in te est.
That's what he or she wants.	Id vel velit.
You're like me.	Tu similis es mihi.
as soon as we can.	cum primum possumus.
Always through.	Semper per.
But there was a lot to be said.	Sed sit amet dictum erat.
But that's a great idea.	Sed ut magna ex.
We do not have.	Non habemus.
There is no problem.	Non est quaestio.
This was good and bad.	Hoc erat bonum et malum.
He did not understand all these things.	Haec omnia non intellexit.
Nothing is easy.	Nihil facile.
No, as has been said.	Non, ut dictum est.
Nothing happened that day.	Nihil illo die factum est.
I'm glad to help you.	Gaudeo te adiuvare.
Lunch is for me.	Prandium est mihi.
He did not say, but he could.	Non dixit, sed potuit.
He's got everything.	Ille omnia obtinuit.
Yes that's great right now.	Etiam id magna nunc.
You said that you were alone.	Solus te esse dixisti.
And that day is finally here.	Et ille dies hic tandem est.
You can go learn.	Ire potes scire.
You can't hear anything.	Non potes aliquid audire.
Do whatever you like.	Fac quod libet.
I am much better.	Ego multo melius.
It is not difficult to see why.	Nec difficile est videre quare.
He has everything here.	Habet hic omnia.
He never was.	Numquam erat.
Certainly he would not.	Noluit certe.
If this were not so, it would not have been.	Si hoc non esset, non esset.
Really didn't know.	Vere nesciebat.
That's better than anything else.	Id melius quam aliud.
If it were good.	Si bona esset.
This was my thing.	Hoc erat mihi res.
We're on time.	In tempore sumus.
He will so.	Ita vult.
Men are not all the same.	Homines non omnes idem sunt.
yes there was something.	Etiam erat aliquid.
What could have been done.	Quod fieri potuit.
He could always hear.	Audire semper potuit.
But it was not now.	Sed non erat nunc.
But there is some fun.	Sed sit amet aliquam est.
It was great being there with everyone.	Magna erat ibi cum omnibus.
I'm glad this happened.	Hoc factum gaudeo.
The whole morning went so quickly.	Totum mane tam cito abiit.
It's likely something.	Verisimile est aliquid ei.
Do as you want! 	Fac sicut vis!
he said to himself.	dixit se.
I've been okay for so long.	Fui bene, tam diu.
But at the same time there is need.	Sed simul opus est.
But it was to be something.	Sed esse aliquid erat.
It cannot be.	Esse non potest.
Which was the first time.	Quod erat primum.
I, too, am a man.	Ego quoque homo sum.
You cannot do so.	Sic facere non potes.
Not only that, but you can do it yourself.	Non solum, sed id ipsum etiam potes.
It is almost ready now.	Fere modo paratus sit.
It's not enough right now.	Non est iam satis.
That's what I believe in.	Id ego in.
This just got to me.	Hoc modo obtinuit ad me.
Nothing, however.	Nihil tamen.
I guess no one else.	Suspicor nemo.
but never did it.	nunquam tamen fecit.
It's fine.	Bene habet.
To be very happy either.	Ut sit amet ipsum vel.
But that's only a great idea.	Sed id magna nisi.
as much as i can.	quod valde possum.
I hope you are right.	Spero recte.
Nothing went right.	Nihil recte abiit.
what could have been wrong?.	Quid enim mali potuit ?.
The future is up to you.	Quod futurum est ad te.
You do what you do.	Facis quod facis.
And well indeed.	Et bene quidem.
He was alone.	Solus erat.
Soon to lunch.	Mox ad prandium.
But here's the question.	Sed hic quaestio est.
But not often in this.	Sed non saepe in hoc.
After this, perhaps you will need one.	Post hoc, fortasse quis opus erit.
You can't do it here.	Hic facere non potes.
I just speak to him.	Modo ei dicam.
I don't know how to do this now.	Nescio quomodo hoc modo.
I think I need a little more.	Paulo plus opus esse puto.
Have something to say.	Habere aliquid dicere.
Something bad, something bad.	Aliquid mali, aliquid mali.
He also wants that.	Etiam velit quam.
Can not.	Non potest.
But that is now.	Sed id est nunc.
That is in you.	Quod in te est.
Who knows this.	Hoc quis scit.
No it's not great.	Nulla non magna ipsum.
Now I've done it.	Nunc feci.
Yes they are not there.	Ita non sunt ibi.
I was not for him.	Non eram pro eo.
With a little .	Cum paulo .
He didn't want to talk or see him now.	Noluit loqui vel videre eum nunc.
I could not go that way.	Ire illo modo non potui.
Everything looks right.	Omnia recte spectat.
We can't do it.	Non possumus facere.
It is more than this.	Plus est quam hoc.
Don't stay there.	Noli ibi manere.
This is very likely.	Verisimile hoc est.
I'd like to think about that.	Libet cogitare de illo.
This is not fun.	Hoc non est amet.
This, however, is not possible.	Hoc tamen fieri non potest.
i was not sick.	non eram male.
But let's start from the front.	Sed sit amet ex ante.
Please let me do this.	Quaeso me hoc facere.
i'll do it with you.	faciam tecum.
He had his day.	Habuit diem suum.
But he never came home.	Sed domum numquam venit.
It is good for him.	Bonum est ei.
It's definitely not the same thing.	Non est certus idem.
if you're in him.	si in eum sis.
The situation is the same for all of us.	Ita se res habet in omnibus nobis.
He was also in him.	Etiam in ipsum erat.
But this was not entirely true.	Sed hoc non erat omnino verum.
He can't say if he wants.	Dicere non potest si velit.
It is he.	Est ille.
I think that they know what to do.	scire se puto quid sit faciendum.
But neither was he himself.	Sed nec ipsum erat.
I am her for lunch.	Ego eam ad prandium sum.
I want you to come to me.	Volo te ad me venire.
He said that he was well.	Dixit se bene esse.
The story was said out loud.	Aliquam dictum dictum magna.
It is not so.	Non ita est.
I did not do so.	Non facerem.
We don't have it anymore.	Non habemus id amplius.
Don't make friends.	Noli amicos facere.
That was what he wanted.	Ut id erat velit.
But you can't.	Sed non potes.
Time was trying.	Tempus erat conatur.
I think she loves it.	Puto amat hoc.
But that is the same.	Sed ut ipsum est.
No one can do this to you.	Hoc tibi nemo facere potest.
Yes that's great.	Etiam id magna.
All the best.	Omnes optime.
It's not what you want.	Non est quod vis.
Maybe she told me.	Fortasse non indicavit mihi.
To be yourself.	Esse ipsum.
This will be the same.	Idem hic erit.
I just didn't know what to do.	Modo nesciebat quid faceret.
Maybe that's what I said.	Aliquam id dictum quam.
He was ready to do it.	Facturum erat paratus.
Well done.	Bene factum est.
Or with anyone.	Vel cum quis.
No, no one said.	Nulla nec dictum est.
But not even that.	Sed ne illud quidem.
And you know you don't have.	Et scis te non habere.
I want you to come with me.	Volo te mecum venire.
Right, so here it is.	Recte, ita hic est.
But doing good does not make one good.	Sed facere bonum non facit unum bonum.
We need it now.	Nunc nobis opus est.
It was really good.	Vere bonum erat.
If nothing more.	Si nihil amplius.
He would not even swim.	Noluit etiam natare.
This is not time.	Hoc non est ad tempus.
You don't owe me anything.	Illa mihi nihil non debes.
he is with you all.	ipse cum omnibus.
Just thought that's all.	Sicut cogitavi ut 'omnes.
I hope it will be.	Spero fore.
Don't let it be.	Ne sit.
Maybe there are enough people who want to do it.	Forsitan satis sunt qui id facere velis.
There is no time.	Non est tempus.
They are also here.	Etiam hic sunt.
You can't see it too bad.	Nimis malum esse non potes videre.
But that was none.	Sed id nulla erat.
He gave me home.	domum mihi dedit.
It's okay, though.	Est bene, sed.
This is where we are now.	Haec ubi nunc sumus.
No he was not.	Nulla non erat.
It's late, it's too late.	Sero, sero.
He ought to say nothing.	Nihil dicere debet.
I wanted to do something that I could make money.	Aliquid facere volui quod pecuniam facere posset.
Well done too.	Bene quoque factum est.
We can't do it here.	Hic facere non possumus.
He was not a man.	non erat homo.
You can speak.	Dicere potes.
It seemed too easy.	Nimis facile videbatur.
It looks something new.	Spectat aliquid novi.
I told you these things.	Haec tibi dixi.
I knew.	Sciebam.
No one really knows what happened.	Nemo vere scit quid acciderit.
I think you mean the truth.	Vis verum puto.
Yes and always yourself.	Etiam et semper ipsum.
not in time.	Non tempore.
But who wants that.	Sed quis velit quam.
Now it was.	Nunc erat.
And again.	Et iterum.
that is one week.	ut una septimana est.
He did not know what it was.	Nesciebat quid esset.
Back to the guy.	Ad guy.
But this could not be done for a long time.	Quod tamen fieri non potuit diu.
But it's not always that.	Sed non semper quam.
I know there can be many.	Scio multa esse posse.
But before that time.	Sed id tempus ante.
I will definitely do this again.	Hoc iterum certum faciam.
At least he knew one thing for sure.	Certe unum pro certo sciebat.
I owe it by myself.	per me ipsum debeo.
Nothing in ad- truth	Nihil in ad- verum.
We met you again.	Iterum autem occurrit vobis.
Maybe not said nothing.	Aliquam nec dictum nisi.
She thought he could act.	Putavit se posse agere.
I never did like that.	Numquam sicut fecit.
The problem was, no one could find him.	Quaestio erat, nemo eum invenire potuit.
How she	Quomodo illa .
So almost.	Ita fere.
The first one was pretty bad.	Primum satis malum fuit.
He did this work easily.	Facile id opus fecit.
Now look here.	Iam hic vide.
This is not good at all.	Hoc est omnino non bene.
Certainly he was never alone.	Solus certe numquam fuit.
Never before.	Numquam ante.
Now, for the purpose.	Nunc, ad rem.
And now with this	Et nunc cum hoc .
That was to do.	Quod erat facere.
I am a man.	homo sum.
I'm not good enough.	Non sum satis.
All the work was done.	Totum opus erat.
We have time for everything.	Tempus habemus ad omnia.
