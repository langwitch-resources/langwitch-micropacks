I hope it will work.	Ke tšepa hore e tla sebetsa tlhahiso.
You never knew if you would see them again.	O ne o sa tsebe hore na o tla ba bona hape.
I wanted to get out of there, quickly.	Ke ne ke batla ho tloha moo, kapele.
It's nice to see that.	Ho monate ho bona seo.
He’s too good not to be.	O molemo haholo hore a se ke a ba.
I want to do this as he did.	Ke batla ho etsa sena joalo ka ha a etsa.
Of course they did.	Ehlile ba entse joalo.
He understood her.	O ile a mo utloisisa.
I just ask.	Ke kopo feela.
He did not want that to happen to him.	O ne a sa batle hore seo e be lebaka la hae.
If you work with me, things like that would never happen again.	Haeba u sebetsa le 'na, lintho tse kang tseo li ne li ke ke tsa hlola li etsahala.
At the party.	Moketeng.
I see someone like you.	Ke bona motho ea tšoanang le uena.
But it was still fun.	Empa ho ne ho ntse ho le monate.
Live long enough and other things will happen.	Phela nako e telele ka ho lekaneng 'me lintho tse ling li tla etsahala.
Now they are tired.	Hona joale ba khathetse.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
I was thinking only of myself.	Ke ne ke nahana ka nna feela.
Go for it.	Etsa joalo.
Mental-mental interaction.	Ho kopana ha kelello le kelello.
I did not want to be here with him.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho ba mona le 'na.
He would do this.	O ne a tla etsa sena.
Of course they are.	Ehlile ba joalo.
It did not take him long to decide.	Ha hoa ka ha mo nka nako e telele ho etsa qeto.
No, you are not alone.	Che, ha u mong.
Then the fun begins.	Joale monate oa qala.
I'm not the man you think you are.	Ha ke monna eo u mo nahanang.
Well, they can have it.	Be, ba ka ba le eona.
Just one morning.	Hoseng ho hong feela.
It comes when it arrives.	E tla ha e fihla.
It is very clear.	E hlakile hantle.
It would be better to see the truth.	Ho ka ba molemo ho bona 'nete.
We can never know who he was or who he was.	Ha re khone ho fumana hore na ke mang kapa e ne e le mang.
The child was in pain.	Ngoana o ne a utloa bohloko.
Yet he was in it.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a le ho eona.
The day before.	Ka letsatsi le fetileng.
I did not understand what was going on there.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise se etsahalang moo.
He did not understand it very well.	O ne a sa e utloisise hantle.
So, please.	Ka hona, ka kopo.
The days go by.	Matsatsi a ntse a tsamaea.
I was still in school.	Ke ne ke ntse ke le sekolong.
He soon heard of it.	Kapele o ile a utloa ka eona.
However, it was not very good.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se ntle haholo.
However, he was here for what.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a le mona ka lebaka la eng.
Yet he will do so.	Leha ho le joalo o tla etsa joalo.
You must win.	O tlameha ho hlola.
We want to too.	Le rona re batla.
Only his hands.	Matsoho a hae feela.
The question is very important.	Potso ke ea bohlokoa haholo.
You need to know what to do when you hear something.	U lokela ho tseba seo u lokelang ho se etsa ha u utloa ntho e itseng.
Now that matters.	Joale hoo ho bohlokoa.
You go back and forth.	U khutlela ka pele.
But you are a man.	Empa o monna.
He has been living in the same room since he arrived.	Haesale a lula le kamore e le 'ngoe ho tloha ha a fihla.
I'm glad you found the time.	Ke thabela hore ebe o fumane nako.
The phone rings.	Mohala oa lla.
Talk a lot.	Bua haholo.
I like to do anything fun.	Ke rata ho etsa ntho efe kapa efe e monate.
That's where it happened.	Ke moo ho ileng ha etsahala.
I don't like to see what's going on right now.	Ha ke rate ho bona hore na ho na le eng hona joale.
That was last year.	E ne e le selemong se fetileng.
I am not a mother either.	Le nna ha ke mme.
Do your homework.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau.
He did not know where he was.	O ne a sa tsebe moo a leng teng.
I do not know what is wrong with this matter.	Ha ke tsebe hore na molato ke eng ka taba ena.
However, it could be something else.	Leha ho le joalo, e ka ba ntho e 'ngoe.
It did not have to.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale hore .
That is what we want.	Ke seo re se batlang.
There is no point in doing nothing.	Ha ho na thuso ea ho etsa letho.
And they all seem to forget that.	Mme bohle ba bonahala ba lebala seo.
I think my goodness is close to seeing.	Ke nahana hore molemo oa ka o haufi le ho bone.
In the end, that is good news.	Qetellong, ke litaba tse molemo tseo.
He was always happy.	O ne a lula a thabile.
And he did not know how easy it would be to forget.	'Me o ne a sa tsebe hore na ho tla ba bonolo ho lebala.
Are you from this area?	Na u tsoa sebakeng se?
We started off in a weird way.	Re ile ra qala ka tsela e makatsang.
We got all of that.	Re fumane tseo kaofela.
They would go home together.	Ba ne ba tla ea hae hammoho.
We didn't have to be here today.	Re ne re sa tlameha ho ba mona kajeno.
Get a call.	Fumana mohala.
I think they have been and have been around for a very long time.	Ke nahana hore ba teng mme esale ba le teng ka nako e telele haholo.
I would hear them.	Ke ne ke tla ba utloa.
I'm sorry, but no.	Ke masoabi, empa che.
I don't think so.	Ha ke nahane hore ho joalo.
Of course, he has a much stronger approach.	Ehlile, o na le mokhoa o matla ho feta.
Obviously, this would take time.	Ho hlakile hore sena se ne se tla nka nako.
It's almost there.	E se e batla e le teng.
I will get a job.	Ke tla fumana mosebetsi.
I did not know that he was calling.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore o letsa.
I agreed.	Ke ile ka e lumela.
Some are doing just that.	Ba bang ba ntse ba etsa joalo.
That way you can do whatever you want to do.	Ka tsela eo u khona ho etsa eng kapa eng eo u batlang ho e etsa.
But that was a good picture.	Empa seo e ne e le setšoantšo se setle.
He came in the morning when we left.	O ile a tla hoseng ha re tsamaea.
There did not seem to be anyone there.	Ho ne ho sa bonahale eka ho na le motho moo.
That benefit is no longer there.	Molemo oo ha o sa le eo.
It should not be long.	Ha ea lokela ho ba nako e telele.
I did not cry, but.	Ha ke a lla, empa.
No one had any money.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a e-na le chelete.
Try to find out what happened.	Leka ho fumana se etsahetseng.
And there are many more.	'Me ho na le tse ling tse ngata.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Empa ha ho bonahale ho le joalo.
They just wanted to meet them.	Ba ne ba batla ho kopana le bona feela.
He will not be gone very long.	A ke ke a tsamaea nako e telele.
I would have done that.	nka be ke entse jwalo.
No, it was not.	Che, ho ne ho le joalo.
They have life.	Ba na le bophelo.
I like that, too.	Ke rata seo, le nna.
Neither would his mother.	Le 'mè oa hae o ne a ke ke a etsa joalo.
That's a bad thing!	Ke ntho e mpe!
There is no other reason.	Haho lebaka le leng.
I want to be with him more.	Ke batla ho ba le eena haholoanyane.
Here, too, the man's style was fun but powerful.	Le mona, mokhoa oa monna eo o ne o le monate empa o le matla.
You have no head.	Ha o na hlooho.
Yes, you read that right.	E, u bala hantle.
We didn't really think about it.	Re ne re sa nahana hakaalo ka eona.
I like the times.	Ke rata linako.
Even alone.	Leha o le mong.
I'm not sure how I would feel about this.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka ikutloa joang ka sena.
Of course, people are not saying anything else.	Ha e le hantle, batho ha ba bue letho le leng.
I hope this helps someone.	Ke tšepa hore sena se thusa motho e mong.
It was not his.	E ne e se ea hae.
I hope there are no hard feelings.	Ke tšepa hore ha ho na maikutlo a thata.
Even now he may still be doing so.	Le hona joale e ka ’na eaba o ntse a etsa joalo.
Books are good for learning.	Libuka li ntle bakeng sa ho ithuta.
I hope he did.	Ke tšepa hore o entse joalo.
Anything can happen, you know.	Ntho efe kapa efe e ka etsahala, ua tseba.
Bad things !.	Lintho tse mpe!.
But don't go.	Empa u se ke ua tsamaea.
It's hard to walk.	Ho thata ho tsamaea.
I told you before.	Ke le boleletse pele.
We offer.	Re fana ka kopo.
I would really like to thank our wonderful team here.	Ke rata haholo ho leboha sehlopha sa rona se makatsang mona.
The children go back to school.	Bana ba khutlela sekolong.
Yet it works well for me.	Leha ho le joalo e sebetsa hantle ho nna.
Without them, we are the only ones.	Ka ntle ho bona, ke rona feela.
Home.	Hae.
We should enjoy this life as long as it lasts.	Re lokela ho thabela bophelo bona ha bo sa le teng.
I know my father.	Ke tseba ntate.
He was accustomed to anything.	O ne a tloaetse ntho efe kapa efe.
They use us.	Ba re sebelisa.
It was that dog.	E ne e le ntja eo.
This or that.	Sena kapa ha ho letho.
Get out as long as you can.	Tsoa ha u ntse u ka khona.
It will be good to know how to do it.	Ho tla ba molemo ho tseba ho e etsa.
Very good money for this kind of place.	Chelete e ntle haholo bakeng sa sebaka sa mofuta ona.
He worked hard.	O ne a sebetsa ka thata.
It can mean life.	E ka bolela bophelo.
Because it is my life right now.	Hobane ke bophelo ba ka hona joale.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
Sometimes things go well together and you feel good.	Ka linako tse ling lintho li kopana hantle 'me u ikutloa u le motle.
He seemed to be able to do anything at the time.	Ho ne ho bonahala a ka etsa eng kapa eng ka nako eo.
I had to have.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho ba le.
It was more imaginative.	E ne e le mohopolo ho feta.
He could have returned home.	A ka be a ile a khutlela hae.
Time is of the essence for them now.	Nako e ba ea bohlokoa ho bona hona joale.
I do not understand this.	Ha ke utloisise sena.
I just want to go out and do.	Ke batla feela ho tsoa le ho etsa.
He is not there for me.	Ha a eo bakeng sa ka.
Otherwise, it should work.	Ntle le moo, e lokela ho sebetsa.
But so far nothing has happened.	Empa ho fihlela joale ha ho letho le etsahetseng.
Now here's the thing.	Joale taba ke ena.
I asked him to take it.	Ke ile ka mo kopa hore a e nke.
In the end, the kids loved it.	Qetellong, bana ba ne ba e rata.
The problem is that it was us.	Bothata ke hore e ne e le rona.
They both look at the girl.	Ka bobeli ba sheba ngoanana eo.
It's your money.	Ke chelete ea hau.
I would definitely go back.	Ka sebele ke ne ke tla khutlela morao.
The police are human too!	Mapolesa ke batho le bona!
He was the only one who did not have it.	E ne e le eena feela ea neng a se na eona.
They look fun.	Li shebahala eka ke monate.
I just couldn’t eat it.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho e ja feela.
The whole house was empty.	Ntlo kaofela e ne e se na motho.
Maybe, maybe he never came back.	Mohlomong, mohlomong ha aa ka a khutla hape.
He didn't look dangerous.	O ne a sa bonahale a le kotsi.
We drive a better car.	Re khanna koloi e betere.
Which should work well for me.	E leng se lokelang ho sebetsa hantle bakeng sa ka.
He mentions his place.	O bolela sebaka sa hae.
But it was already night.	Empa e ne e se e le bosiu.
We will not allow this to happen.	Re ke ke ra lumella sena ho etsahala.
I forget what it is.	Ke lebala hore na ke eng.
It's just too hard.	Ho thata haholo feela.
Because it was our home.	Hobane e ne e le ntlo ea rona.
We would love to work with you.	Re ka thabela ho sebetsa le uena.
People loved him and often asked about him.	Batho ba ne ba mo rata ’me hangata ba ne ba botsa ka eena.
I usually wear them.	Hangata ke li apara.
Maybe time will tell.	Mohlomong nako e tla bolela.
He could still do that.	O ne a ntse a ka etsa seo.
But it doesn't matter to me.	Empa ha e bohlokoa ho nna.
She goes home to the children.	O ya hae ho bana.
I have had good health problems, to say the least.	Ke bile le mathata a bophelo a monate, ho bua hanyane.
He had his own opinion about the player.	O ne a e-na le maikutlo a hae ka sebapali.
We would be lifelong friends.	Re ne re tla ba metsoalle ea bophelo bohle.
This is not for me!	Sena ha se sa ka!
Or you can have anything.	Kapa u ka ba le eng kapa eng.
She is not leaving.	Ha a tsamaee.
Nothing was good.	Ha ho letho le neng le le molemo.
I did not know about all that.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ka tseo tsohle.
It was not at all true.	Ho hang e ne e se ’nete.
It was very nice to be with him at home.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo ho ba le eena hae.
I will write if you need to.	Ke tla ngola haeba u hloka.
This is the police station.	Sebaka sa mapolesa ke sona.
Everyone must understand it.	Bohle ba tlameha ho e utloisisa.
You will learn more than you can imagine.	O tla ithuta ho feta kamoo o ka nahanang kateng.
I don't know if that will work, but it can happen.	Ha ke tsebe hore na seo se tla etsa mosebetsi, empa ho ka etsahala.
I see something in you.	Ke bona se seng ka ho wena.
This is your team.	Sena ke sehlopha sa hau.
Then we wrote more.	Eaba re ngola ho feta.
I have to say it was pretty cool.	Ke tlameha ho re e ne e le ntle haholo.
Keep things simple.	Boloka lintho li le bonolo feela.
However it was too late.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e se e le morao haholo.
What you were looking for was not what you thought you wanted.	Ntho eo u neng u e batla e ne e se ntho eo u neng u nahana hore ua e batla.
Yet questions remain.	Leha ho le joalo lipotso li ntse li le teng.
We will never achieve it, but we keep trying.	Ha ho mohla re tla e fihlela, empa re tsoela pele ho leka.
I just want to know where he came from.	Ke mpa ke batla ho tseba hore na o tsoa kae.
This could not be more true.	Sena e ka se be 'nete ho feta.
He does not even know what he will do when he gets there.	Ha a tsebe le seo a tla se etsa ha a fihla moo.
I can work.	Nka sebetsa.
He is the one who will come to the dog.	Ke eena ea tla ntja.
Here it is!.	Ke ena!.
I can hope this will happen.	Nka tšepa hore sena se tla etsahala.
Hours and hours of time.	Lihora le lihora tsa nako.
It really is not an easy task.	Ehlile hase ntho e bonolo.
And he did just that.	Mme o entse jwalo haholo.
Not so now.	Ha ho joalo hona joale.
However, it is important.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ea bohlokoa.
You should not go out at this time of night.	Ha ua lokela ho tsoa ka nako ena ea bosiu.
The same was true of children.	Ho ne ho le joalo le ka bana.
I look behind me.	Ke sheba ka morao ho nna.
I mean you saw it.	Ke bolela hore o e bone.
That is the point.	Ke eona taba.
They are always busy eating.	Ba lula ba phathahane ka ho ja.
Some are very good.	Tse ling li ntle haholo.
Thanks for joining.	Ke leboha ho kena.
You do not think.	Ha u nahane.
I want to know how to get that picture.	Ke batla ho tseba mokhoa oa ho fumana setšoantšo seo.
They may be enough.	Li ka 'na tsa lekana.
Neither his wife, nor his father.	Leha e le mosali oa hae, kapa ntate oa hae.
You learn a lot.	U ithuta lintho tse ngata.
How do you want to write?	Joang leha u batla ho ngola.
I have never seen anything like it before or since.	Ha ke so bone ntho e joalo pele kapa ho tloha ka nako eo.
But there was more.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le tse ling tse ngata.
My wife went there to help these people.	Mosali oa ka o ile a ea moo ho thusa batho bana.
That's the way it is.	Ke eona tsela.
He would make beautiful children.	O ne a tla etsa bana ba batle.
I wanted them to know it.	Ke ne ke batla hore ba e tsebe.
I saw that he was not there.	Ke ile ka bona hore ha a eo.
We were visiting my husband’s work.	Re ne re etela mosebetsi oa monna oa ka.
He says, these are very good.	O re, tsena li ntle haholo.
They just know what they want and how to get it.	Ba tseba feela seo ba se batlang le hore na ba ka se fumana joang.
Until the next time it happens.	Ho fihlela nakong e tlang ha e etsahala.
Children should not work that way.	Bana ha baa lokela ho sebetsa ka tsela eo.
It's real.	Ke oa sebele.
He could not see very well.	O ne a sa bone hantle hakaalo.
I did not touch his name.	Ha kea ka ka tšoara lebitso la hae.
You will go to school.	U tla ea sekolong.
This book is the one I love the most so far.	Buka ena ke eona eo ke e ratang haholo ho fihlela joale.
Well done, by the way.	O entse hantle, ka tsela.
But they refused.	Empa ba ile ba hana.
I will never be able to fix this.	Ha ke sa tla khona ho lokisa sena.
I had no idea he would see it that way.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore o tla e bona ka tsela eo.
You are useless.	Ha u na thuso.
I'm glad to see you too.	Le nna ke thabela ho o bona.
He did not know what time it was.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke nako mang.
The children slept on it.	Bana ba ne ba robala ka eona.
And they were, indeed.	Mme ba ne ba le jwalo, ruri.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
So far, it has not.	Ho fihlela joale, ha e e-so.
I know this.	Ke tseba sena.
We asked them not to return.	Re ile ra ba kōpa hore ba se ke ba khutla.
I hope not.	Ke tšepa hore ha se eona.
I wish that could happen soon.	Ke lakatsa eka seo se ka etsahala kapele.
We had food, water.	Re ne re e-na le lijo, metsi.
I started to cry.	Ke ile ka qala ho lla.
We take and take until you have no offer.	Re nka le ho nka ho fihlela u se u se na ho fana.
That he did not want to understand.	Hore o ne a sa batle ho utloisisa.
This, to me, has a problem.	Sena, ho nna, se na le bothata.
I need to sleep, but I can't.	Ke hloka ho robala, empa ha ke khone.
It is the first time this has happened.	Ke lekhetlo la pele e etsahala.
In the end, he could not think straight.	Qetellong, o ne a sa khone ho nahana hantle.
This is a wonderful time for us.	Ena ke nako e monate ho rona.
We all do it every day.	Kaofela re li etsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
They have not done their job but will do it from tonight onwards.	Ha ba eso etse mosebetsi wa bona empa ba tla etsa ho tloha bosiung bona ho ya pele.
But maybe one player is needed.	Empa mohlomong ho hlokahala sebapali se le seng.
It will not help.	E ke ke ea thusa letho.
It's just easy to be there.	Ho bonolo feela ho ba teng.
There is no time for that now.	Ha ho nako ea seo hona joale.
It is not who you are and what you are.	Ha se mang le seo o leng sona.
He was great.	O ne a le moholo.
So she doesn't know what you look like.	Kahoo ha a tsebe hore na u shebahala joang.
So you may have some problems or some other task that you have to do.	Kahoo u ka ba le mathata a itseng kapa mosebetsi o mong oo u lokelang ho o etsa.
People are talking about it.	Batho ba ntse ba bua ka eona.
He just knew he wanted to start getting things.	O ne a tseba feela hore o batla ho qala ho fumana lintho.
They were very important.	E ne e le ba bohlokoa haholo.
Maybe I don't know.	Mohlomong ha ke tsebe.
He came home.	A tla hae.
The same is true of all others.	Ho joalo le ka ba bang kaofela.
I almost gave up.	Ke ile ka batla ke e tlohela.
I say no.	Ke re che.
It is a very difficult task.	Ke mosebetsi o boima haholo.
But people have never seen Mother.	Empa ha ho mohla batho ba kileng ba bona ’Mè.
Yes, of course.	E, ho hlakile.
But there was no time to talk about it.	Empa ho ne ho se nako ea ho bua ka taba ena.
What he was, in the end.	Seo a neng a le sona, qetellong.
To save our time.	Ho boloka nako ea rona.
But when he tried to walk away, he could not.	Empa ha a leka ho tsamaea, a sitoa.
They certainly seemed alone.	Ka sebele ba ne ba bonahala ba le bang.
Some things are connected here.	Lintho tse ling li kopane mona.
The food was very tasty.	Lijo li ne li le monate haholo.
I was in excruciating pain.	Ke ile ka tšoaroa ke bohloko bo bohloko.
This applies today.	Sena se sebetsa kajeno.
But we started.	Empa re ile ra qala.
But it is not easy to do so.	Empa ha ho bonolo ho etsa joalo.
He is able.	O khona.
They keep coming.	Ba nna ba tla.
Now I know what it is.	Joale kea tseba hore na ke eng.
What can we expect.	Re ka lebella eng.
What he went through.	Seo a fetileng ho sona.
Why do you want to do this?	Ke hobane'ng ha u batla ho etsa see?
Or any of the others since then.	Kapa leha e le efe ea tse ling ho tloha ka nako eo.
That doesn't just matter.	Seo ha se taba feela.
There was no reason to.	Ho ne ho se na lebaka la ho.
They take good care of you.	Ba u hlokomela hantle.
Allow to stay overnight.	Lumella ho lula bosiu.
Anything that made you think about that.	Eng kapa eng e entseng hore u nahane ka seo.
The real thing.	Ntho ya sebele.
Yes, it's fun.	E, ho monate.
It has done what it wants in any way.	E entse seo a se batlang ka tsela efe kapa efe.
You can have a wonderful life here where you are.	O ka ba le bophelo bo monate mona moo o leng teng.
It was a difficult day.	E ne e le letsatsi le boima.
I stayed with him for a long time.	Ke ile ka lula le eena nako e telele.
It's been a while now that we've been here.	E se e le nako joale re le teng.
Neither do you.	Le uena ha u etse joalo.
Not everyone will like you, time.	Ha se bohle ba tla u rata, nako.
Then they can get whatever they want.	Joale ba ka fumana eng kapa eng eo ba e batlang.
The teacher asked a question.	Tichere e ile ea botsa potso.
I thought you did too.	Ke ne ke nahana hore le uena u entse joalo.
We are in that time again.	Re nakong eo hape.
Because he was still a child.	Hobane e ne e sa le ngoana.
There are so many things you can do here.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo u ka li etsang mona.
It's useless.	Ha e na thuso.
New money, of course.	Chelete e ncha, ehlile.
Then he finally did what we asked for.	Eaba qetellong o etsa seo re neng re se kōpa.
We continue to live.	Re tsoela pele ho phela.
In the end, no one was hurt.	Qetellong, ha ho motho ea ileng a tsoa kotsi.
I try not to do that, but it's just hard when you see it.	Ke leka ho se etse jwalo, empa ho thata feela ha o e bona.
He worked, worked, and worked some more.	O ile a sebetsa, a sebetsa, 'me a sebetsa tse ling hape.
He is still very fast.	O sa le kapele haholo.
They think of us.	Ba nahana ka rona.
This was very important.	Sena se ne se le bohlokoa haholo.
It didn't work either.	Le 'na ha ea sebetsa.
Don't do that.	O seke wa etsa seo.
I will know in a day or so.	Ke tla tseba ka mor'a letsatsi kapa ho feta.
And I have a job.	Mme ke na le mosebetsi.
The same is true of him.	Ho joalo le ka eena.
It finally paid off.	Qetellong e ile ea lefa.
He tried to refuse but failed.	O ile a leka ho hana empa a sitoa.
We'll see you soon.	Re tla u bona haufinyane.
I want to tell you this.	Ke batla ho o bolella sena.
Obviously it didn't work.	Ho hlakile hore e ne e sa sebetsa.
We didn't talk much.	Re ne re sa bue hakaalo.
However, he did not stop there.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a ka a ema moo.
He opened the whole house.	A bula ntlo kaofela.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
No, someone was missing.	Che, ho na le motho ea neng a le sieo.
Talk about what you would like to do.	Bua ka seo u ka ratang ho se etsa.
You would not know.	O ne o ka se tsebe.
The first question is often the most difficult.	Hangata potso ea pele ke eona e thata ka ho fetisisa.
I had a really good time.	Ke bile le nako e monate haholo.
I want a party.	Ke batla mokete.
They provide what we will buy.	Ba fana ka seo re tla se reka.
I had made a mistake.	Ke ne ke entse phoso.
He tried something else, and it still did, but the pain continued.	O ile a leka ntho e 'ngoe, 'me ho ntse ho le joalo, empa bohloko bo ile ba tsoela pele.
The rest of the group agreed.	Ba bang kaofela ba sehlopha ba ile ba lumela.
He has no reason.	Ha a na lebaka.
It looks very simple, but it works.	E bonahala e le bonolo haholo, empa ea sebetsa.
At the scene of the accident, everyone was crying.	Sebakeng sa kotsi, bohle ba ne ba lla.
He may have returned home.	E ka 'na eaba o ile a khutlela hae.
They were not into it.	Ba ne ba sa kena ho eona.
Have you ever said anything?	Na o kile oa bua letho?
It was almost powerful.	E ne e batla e le matla.
I really want him to be here.	Ke hlile ke batla hore a be teng mona.
To do something.	Ho etsa ntho.
I was expecting more.	Ke ne ke lebeletse ho feta.
There is no chance of that here.	Haho monyetla wa seo mona.
I am visiting my wife.	Ke etela mosali oa ka.
No, not at all.	Che, ha ho joalo hantle.
There are more to come.	Ho na le tse ling tse tlang.
I have nothing right now.	Ha ke na letho hona joale.
For some people, that may be difficult.	Ho batho ba bang, seo se ka ba boima.
And she didn't even want to talk to me before.	Mme o ne a sa batle le ho bua le nna pele.
One we have yet to name.	E 'ngoe eo re e-s'o be le lebitso la eona.
Getting in and out is not difficult.	Ho kena le ho tsoa ha ho thata.
Still, I enjoyed working with him.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke thabela ho sebetsa le eena.
His mistake or not, he had it all.	Phoso ea hae kapa che, o ne a e-na le tsohle.
They were all crying.	Kaofela ba ne ba lla.
Because no one really knows what to do with it.	Hobane ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle hore na a etse eng ka eona.
Then again, there is only one name.	Joale hape, ho na le ntho e le 'ngoe ea lebitso.
Good heavy stuff.	Lintho tse boima tse ntle.
Anything will happen.	Eng kapa eng e tla etsahala.
He let her in.	A mo lumella ho kena.
He sees many.	O bona ba bangata.
But catch that idea.	Empa tšoara mohopolo oo.
It's not the way you want them to be.	Ha se ka tsela eo u batlang hore ba be ka eona.
I have never said anything like that.	Ha ke eso bue ntho e jwalo.
He had just found a place.	O ne a fumane sebaka feela.
He had to get it.	O ne a lokela ho fumana.
He did not speak for long.	Ha aa ka a bua nako e telele.
And then there would be nothing.	'Me joale ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba le letho.
Put on your clothes again.	Apara liaparo tsa hau hape.
If you have not already done so, you must do so.	Haeba u sa e etsa, u tlameha ho e etsa.
I have no money right now.	Ha ke na chelete hona joale.
This made me think.	Sena se ile sa etsa hore ke nahane.
The party went on all night.	Mokete o ne o tsoela pele bosiu bohle.
I stayed at his home a lot this year.	Ke ile ka lula ha hae haholo selemong sena.
It would be wrong to do so.	E tla be e le phoso ho etsa joalo.
They have what we do not have.	Ba na le seo re se nang sona.
The party is fun.	Mokete o monate.
I want to try to say something now.	Ke batla ho leka ho bua ho hong jwale.
Something else is also important.	Ntho e 'ngoe hape ea bohlokoa.
I think that is the most important thing.	Ke nahana hore ke eona ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
It wasn't you.	E ne e se uena.
It just takes you.	E u nka feela.
I like news.	Ke rata litaba.
We meet them tonight.	Re kopana le bona bosiung bona.
There was no way out of it.	Ho ne ho se na tsela ea ho tsoa ho eona.
It took him a while to talk to me again.	Ho ile ha nka nako hore a bue le ’na hape.
But come in, come in.	Empa kena, kena.
Now is our time.	Joale ke nako ea rona.
No one will speak.	Ha ho motho ya tla bua.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
Here is a picture of one.	Mona ke setšoantšo sa e 'ngoe.
But those things were not news.	Empa lintho tseo e ne e se litaba.
I just heard about them.	Ke utloile feela ka tsona.
But, today it was fun.	Empa, kajeno ho bile monate.
There was no other chance.	Ho ne ho se na monyetla o mong.
The same can be said of a woman.	Ho ka ba joalo le ka mosali.
He spoke quickly.	A bua kapele.
Not worse.	Ha e mpe le ho feta.
He is here now.	O mona jwale.
But that did not happen.	Empa seo ha sea ka sa etsahala.
It’s hard to say whether it worked or not.	Ho thata ho bolela hore na e ne e sebetsa kapa che.
He needs to do things in a certain way.	O hloka ho etsa lintho ka tsela e itseng.
Just know where to start.	Feela tseba moo ho qala.
We did, we tried.	Re ile ra etsa joalo, ra leka.
He was very happy.	O ne a thabile haholo.
We can never know the truth of what happened now.	Re ke ke ra tseba 'nete ea se etsahetseng hona joale.
No one saw anything wrong with it.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a bona letho le phoso ka eona.
No, no.	Che, che.
Not everyone can do it.	Ha se bohle ba ka e etsang.
But read the book.	Empa bala buka.
I hope so.	Ke tšepa hore ho joalo.
He was expecting all that.	O ne a lebeletse tseo tsohle.
Probably the best thing they ever did.	Mohlomong ntho e monate ka ho fetisisa eo ba e entseng.
Dad all the time.	Ntate ka nako tsohle.
Call when you say you will call.	Letsa ha o re o tlo letsa.
It did not provide any funding.	Ha ea ka ea fana ka chelete.
But now was not the time to slow down.	Empa joale e ne e se nako ea ho khutlela morao.
You have to go.	U tlameha ho tsamaea.
It can make it even harder.	E ka etsa hore ho be thata le ho feta.
He was almost equal.	O ile a batla a lekana.
I had to give it everything.	Ke ne ke lokela ho o fa tsohle.
Lots of new stuff, learning every day.	Lintho tse ngata tse ncha, ho ithuta letsatsi le leng le le leng.
And you did the only thing you knew how to do.	'Me u entse ntho feela eo u neng u tseba ho e etsa.
He was still alone.	O ne a ntse a le mong.
The coming hours will be crucial.	Lihora tse tlang e tla ba tsa bohlokoa.
We are happy.	Re thabile.
But he doesn't know anything about it.	Empa ha a tsebe letho ka seo.
That is why we are here first.	Ke kahoo re leng teng pele.
So there is a mistake.	Kahoo ho na le phoso.
No one was ever guilty.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a ba molato.
I told my mom what she had said.	Ke ile ka bolella ’Mè seo a se buileng.
With people like them.	Ka batho ba kang bona.
I do not believe that.	Ha ke lumele seo.
It doesn't matter.	Ha e na bohlokoa.
All he could do.	Sohle seo a neng a ka se etsa.
I thought you probably didn't care.	Ke ne ke nahana hore mohlomong ha o tsotelle.
That would be my job.	Oo e ne e tla ba mosebetsi oa ka.
It had been more difficult than she had expected.	E ne e bile mosebetsi o boima ho feta oo a neng a o lebeletse.
Otherwise, you will not be able to do that.	Ntle ho moo, o ka se khone ho etsa joalo.
You should be much better this year.	O lokela ho ba betere haholo selemong sena.
She is very busy with her food.	O phathahane haholo ka lijo tsa hae.
I believe so.	Ke lumela joalo.
An important person.	Motho oa bohlokoa.
I can think of something.	Nka nahana ka ntho e itseng.
The only thing is.	Ntho feela ke hore.
Things are clear.	Lintho li hlakile.
But they knew they had to leave.	Empa ba ne ba tseba hore ba tlameha ho tsamaea.
He knew the area well.	O ne a tseba sebaka seo hantle.
Yet problems remain.	Leha ho le joalo mathata a ntse a le teng.
He heard that there were problems.	O ile a utloa hore ho na le mathata.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing.	Empa hoo ha se hakaalo hore ke ntho e mpe.
But you don't see it much anymore.	Empa ha o sa e bona haholo.
That is what he wanted.	Ke sona seo a neng a se batla.
Some of them even do so.	Ba bang ba bona ba bile ba etsa joalo.
We decided together.	Re ile ra etsa qeto hammoho.
You wonder why that happens.	U nahana hore na ke hobane'ng ha seo se etsahala.
He has been writing since then.	Haesale a ngola ho tloha ka nako eo.
I can feel the energy.	Ke khona ho utloa matla.
Some of them already exist.	Tse ling tsa tsona li se li le teng.
And this is not just a matter of money.	'Me sena ha se taba ea chelete feela.
Maybe even before he had called her.	Mohlomong le pele a ka be a ile a mo letsetsa.
They know where we are.	Ba tseba moo re leng teng.
That, of course, would make things better.	Ka sebele seo se ne se tla etsa hore lintho li be molemo.
Everyone wants power.	E mong le e mong o batla matla.
We want to get people to do what we want.	Re batla ho etsa hore batho ba etse seo re se batlang.
Why do we use this.	Hobaneng re sebelisa sena.
He thought it would be so.	O ne a nahana hore ho tla ba joalo.
They just love going to work.	Ba mpa ba rata ho ea mosebetsing.
Or whatever the original.	Kapa eng kapa eng ea pele.
Have you heard the news?	Na u utloile litaba?
The reason is that it is exactly how we think.	Lebaka ke hore ke hantle kamoo re nahanang kateng.
Today, everyone does everything.	Kajeno, bohle ba etsa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
He is not there.	Ha a eo.
But it does not have to be.	Empa ha ho hlokahale hore ho be joalo.
I ask people why they believe.	Ke botsa batho hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba lumela.
They knew we did not have an easy time.	Ba ne ba tseba hore ha re na nako e bonolo.
Very tasty, almost very simple.	E monate haholo, hoo e batlang e le bonolo haholo.
I know it is very good.	Kea tseba hore e ntle haholo.
But it really made things worse.	Empa ehlile e entse hore lintho li mpe le ho feta.
He went back downstairs and studied with her.	O ile a khutlela fatše 'me a mo ithuta.
We were crying.	Re ne re lla.
I was just starting to do this.	Ke ne ke qala ho etsa sena.
Then start again.	Ebe u qala hape.
But often that is not the case.	Empa hangata ha ho joalo.
Others refuse to believe us.	Ba bang bona ba hana ho re lumela.
I found it, thank you.	Ke e fumane, kea leboha.
You have to get out of work.	U tlameha ho tsoa ho sebetsa.
These are relatively new.	Tsena li batla li le ncha.
I think you will find it interesting.	Ke nahana hore o tla fumana ho le monate.
Some of us have seen that.	Ba bang ba rona ba bone seo.
Make sure you get the things you want before you go.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u fumana lintho tseo u li batlang pele li tsamaea.
I'm not the one he thinks about.	Ha se 'na eo a nahanang ka eena.
To know more about.	Ho tseba haholoanyane ka.
You can sleep again.	U ka robala hape.
So we both tried.	Kahoo re ile ra leka ka bobeli.
Well, you can't have them or him.	Be, u ke ke ua ba le bona kapa eena.
They made us do it again for him.	Ba ile ba etsa hore re e etse hape bakeng sa hae.
He had no time to look.	O ne a se na nako ea ho sheba.
It's not something like that.	Ha se ntho e kang eo.
No one has ever been there.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a ba teng.
But now we are.	Empa joale re.
Here is my point.	Taba ea ka ke ena.
It is up to us to decide.	Ho ho rona ho etsa qeto.
Make sure you thank her when you are done.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u mo leboha ha u qetile.
Her eldest son is a freshman.	Mora oa hae e moholo ke motho ea sa tsoa qeta sekolong.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
She looked at him softly.	A mo sheba ka bonolo.
I have to finish my homework.	Ke tlameha ho qeta mosebetsi oa ka oa sekolo.
Somehow it was better.	Ka tsela e itseng ho ne ho le molemo.
We have to make a decision.	Re tlameha ho etsa qeto.
My speech was irrational.	Ho bua ha ka ho ne ho se na kelello.
It should have known.	E ne e lokela ho tseba.
It is necessary to leave.	Ho hlokahala ho tloha.
He seemed to enjoy being around me.	O ne a bonahala a thabela ho ba haufi le ’na.
I use it now.	Kea e sebelisa hona joale.
He had done it.	O ne a e entse.
It doesn't matter where.	Ha ho na taba hore kae.
It did very well.	E entse hantle haholo.
Eventually he did.	Qetellong o ile a etsa joalo.
Then he said he would do it.	Eaba o re o tla e etsa.
I have a mind.	Ke na le kelello.
It may be best to forget the whole thing.	Ho ka ba molemo ho lebala taba eo kaofela.
He loved to do things.	O ne a rata ho etsa lintho.
Think about it.	Nahana ka eona.
There was always time to fix it.	Kamehla ho ne ho e-na le nako ea ho lokisa.
Or think of many other things, though.	Kapa u nahane ka lintho tse ling tse ngata, leha ho le joalo.
They have done this many times.	Ba kile ba etsa sena hangata.
The problem is finding them.	Bothata ke ho li fumana.
They claimed innocence.	Ba ne ba bolela hore ha ba na molato.
No past friends.	Ha ho metsoalle ea nakong e fetileng.
He loved to travel.	O ne a rata ho tsamaea.
That is your decision.	Eo ke qeto ea hao.
Of course, that was not difficult.	Ha e le hantle, seo se ne se se thata.
Here is my situation.	Boemo ba ka ke bona.
I let him make his way.	Ke ile ka mo lumella ho etsa tsela ea hae.
He knew about her.	O ne a tseba ka eena.
He is.	O joalo.
This is the last thing you want.	Ena ke ntho ea ho qetela eo u e batlang.
Work at this school can be dangerous.	Mosebetsi sekolong sena o ka ba kotsi.
It does not make sense at all.	Ho hang ha e na kelello.
Some were traveling in the area.	Ba bang ba ne ba tsamaea sebakeng seo.
I didn't care.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle.
We love him.	Re a mo rata.
I write them.	Kea li ngola.
I'm here for work.	Ke mona ka mosebetsi.
So, should you stay in this room?	Kahoo, u lokela ho lula ka kamoreng ee?
That is no longer a question.	Seo ha se sa na potso.
They were doing their job and they were doing it well.	Ba ne ba etsa mosebetsi oa bona ’me ba o etsa hantle.
I like reading.	Ke rata ho bala.
Thank you !.	Ke a leboha!.
That's one of the nice things about it.	Ke e 'ngoe ea lintho tse ntle ka eona.
Maybe this is not mine.	Mohlomong ena ha se ea ka.
Now he could no longer walk.	Joale o ne a se a sa khone ho tsamaea.
I was guilty.	Ke ne ke le molato.
That would not be a bad thing.	Seo e ka se be ntho e mpe.
He has one son and his wife.	O na le mora a le mong le mosali oa hae.
I just believe those things.	Ke mpa feela ke lumela lintho tseo.
And that's just the way it is.	Mme ho jwalo feela.
He finally got help.	Qetellong o ile a fumana thuso.
Yours looks even better.	Ea hau e shebahala e le betere le ho feta.
He saw them.	O ba bone.
She is amazingly healthy.	O phela hantle ka tsela e makatsang.
What's your name?	Lebitso la hau ke mang?
The family had dinner together.	Lelapa le ile la ja lijo tsa mantsiboea hammoho.
He had to keep going.	O ile a tlameha ho tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
I like to write.	Ke rata ho ngola.
People began to love him more and more.	Batho ba ile ba qala ho mo rata haholo.
You know, we can do it.	Ua tseba, re ka e etsa.
His family was with him.	Lelapa la hae le ne le e-na le eena.
Better yet.	Molemo o betere.
I like being alone.	Ke rata ho ba mong.
He ate alone.	O ne a ja a le mong.
And at the time, it was a very good idea.	Mme ka nako eo, e ne e le mohopolo o motle haholo.
Only one group returned.	Ke sehlopha se le seng feela se ileng sa khutla.
The food went very well.	Lijo li ile tsa tsamaea hantle haholo.
But he knows he can't.	Empa oa tseba hore a ke ke a khona.
He too had made time.	Le eena o ne a entse nako.
This was a long time ago.	Ena e ne e le khale e le teng.
I knew my wife.	Ke ne ke tseba mosali oa ka.
This was a very nice place.	Ena e ne e le sebaka se setle haholo.
You never asked anyone what it meant.	Ha ho mohla o kileng oa botsa mang kapa mang hore na e bolela eng.
That starts tomorrow.	Seo se qala hosane.
I try to help.	Ke leka ho thusa.
I did not want to be arrested at night.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho tšoaroa bosiu.
You are never alone.	Ha ho mohla u leng mong.
So there are a lot of questions, a lot of them.	Kahoo ho na le lipotso tse ngata, tse ngata.
How to get what you want.	Mokhoa oa ho fumana seo u se batlang.
At that time, most people will know who he is.	Ka nako eo, batho ba bangata ba tla tseba hore na ke mang.
I could not eat.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ja.
Arrive on time for work.	Fihla ka nako bakeng sa mosebetsi.
he asked.	a botsa.
Each of them is important.	E 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ea tsona e bohlokoa.
The process is very simple with you. 	Mokhoa o bonolo haholo le uena. 
Soon there would be no room for him.	Haufinyane ho ne ho ke ke ha hlola ho e-ba le sebaka bakeng sa hae.
I had to wait a few more days.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho ema matsatsi a 'maloa hape.
Which is usually a good idea.	E leng seo hangata e leng mohopolo o motle.
And then say what you say.	Mme ebe o bolela seo o se buang.
I do not want anyone to see this.	Ha ke batle hore motho a bone sena.
Meet me.	Kopana le nna.
The food was very good.	Lijo li ne li le ntle haholo.
For us, we try to keep it in its place.	Ho rona, re leka ho e boloka sebakeng sa eona.
More will be needed.	Ho feta moo ho tla hlokahala.
He is a young man.	O mohlankana.
I am here to stay.	Ke mona ho lula.
And someone else.	Le motho e mong.
Of course, there are many more.	Ehlile, ho na le tse ling tse ngata.
I know this is not what you want to hear.	Kea tseba hore sena ha se seo u batlang ho se utloa.
I mean a lot.	Ke bolela haholo.
Continue until you finish it.	Tsoela pele ho fihlela u e qeta.
Today it was much better.	Kajeno ho ne ho le betere haholo.
I know it and you know it.	Ke a e tseba mme le wena o a e tseba.
We cannot continue with it.	Re ke ke ra tsoela pele ka eona.
It makes it seem like nothing has ever happened here.	E etsa hore ho bonahale eka ha ho letho le kileng la etsahala mona.
Probably even stronger.	Mohlomong le matla.
I want a girl.	Ke batla ngoanana.
Things are going well.	Lintho li tsamaea hantle.
I hope you like them !.	Kea tšepa u li rata!.
I should enjoy being with them.	Ke lokela ho thabela ho ba le bona.
It doesn't matter, though.	Ha e tsotelle, leha ho le jwalo.
But the woman did not think about this.	Empa mosali eo ha aa ka a nahana ka sena.
My father paid for my departure.	Ntate o ile a lefa hore ke tsamaee.
This too was a mistake.	Sena le sona e ne e le phoso.
What he was.	Seo a neng a le sona.
We are leaving tomorrow.	Re tsamaea hosane.
I just look at him.	Ke mo sheba feela.
But, well.	Empa, hantle.
I don't care what they did before.	Ha ke tsotelle seo ba se entseng pele ho moo.
Be careful! 	Hlokomela!
When you start talking to yourself.	Ha u qala ho bua u le mong .
That was where we lived.	Ke hona moo re neng re lula teng.
You know you can talk to me or your mom about anything.	O a tseba o ka bua le nna kapa mme wa hao ka eng kapa eng.
The strange thing to me is that.	Ntho e makatsang ho nna ke hore na.
He gave up.	O ile a tlohela.
But there was nobody there.	Empa ho ne ho se na motho.
We have nothing.	Ha re na letho.
This is also a good thing.	Sena le sona se setle.
No one else has ever done that for you.	Ha ho motho e mong ea kileng a u etsetsa joalo.
Many people agreed.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba lumela.
If you can find these, write.	Haeba u ka fumana tsena, ngola.
Now, though.	Hona joale, leha ho le joalo.
That was the first one.	Eo e ne e le ea pele.
Or we were alone.	Kapa re ne re le bang.
He wanted to live his life with you.	O ne a batla ho phela bophelo ba hae le uena.
Of course, we come from an old school.	Ehlile, re tsoa sekolong sa khale.
He did not understand what people were saying.	O ne a sa utloisise hore na batho ba bua ka eng.
He could hear it.	O ne a khona ho e utloa.
I tried to get a good picture of it.	Ke ile ka leka ho fumana setšoantšo se setle sa eona.
That's him.	Ke eena.
What we just did.	Seo re sa tsoa se etsa.
That works well.	Seo se sebetsa hantle.
The children are injured.	Bana ba tsoa kotsi.
It looks good.	E shebahala e le ntle.
And if he had.	'Me haeba a ne a e-na le .
It is very easy to use now.	Ho bonolo haholo ho li sebelisa hona joale.
That after all is the whole question.	Hore ka mor'a tsohle ke potso eohle.
No problems, just a few questions.	Ha ho na mathata, lipotso tse 'maloa feela.
They leave.	Ba tsamaea.
I like this place.	Ke rata sebaka sena.
That's unthinkable.	Seo ha se nahane.
Good balance is good.	Ho lekana hantle ho molemo.
I did not learn the news today.	Ha kea ithuta litaba kajeno.
Probably better than anyone.	Mohlomong molemo ho feta mang kapa mang.
It is difficult to learn without water.	Ho thata ho ithuta ntle le metsi.
No application process will be required.	Ha ho na mokhoa oa ho etsa kopo o tla hlokahala.
Not knowing who, not knowing how, not knowing why.	Ho se tsebe mang, ho sa tsebe joang, ho sa tsebe lebaka.
too much danger.	kotsi e ngata haholo.
You can't tell anyone.	O ka se bolelle mang kapa mang.
He will do so.	O tla etsa joalo.
It's too long.	E telele.
It was too much to expect.	E ne e le ntho e ngata haholo ho e lebella.
I just got there.	Ke sa tsoa fihla moo.
We need to meet and be friends.	Re hloka ho kopana 'me re be metsoalle.
That’s all you were.	Ke sohle seo u neng u se sona.
I will thank her when she gets home.	Ke tla mo leboha ha a fihla hae.
And that’s almost everything in it.	'Me ke hoo e ka bang sohle se teng ho eona.
But they were there.	Empa ba ne ba le teng.
He has not said anything to police so far.	Ha a e-s'o bue letho ho mapolesa ho fihlela joale.
I felt so good that I could give up.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke le monate haholo hore nka tlohela.
They are equal to others.	Ba lekana le ba bang.
I have never been.	Ha ke eso be teng.
Gradually, the hours passed.	Hanyane ka hanyane, lihora tsa feta.
For us, it was easy money.	Ho rona, e ne e le chelete e bonolo.
But it takes time.	Empa ho nka nako.
I asked him.	Ke ile ka mo botsa.
Neither is it.	Le eona ha se che.
The time is coming.	Nako ea tla.
He didn't want to ask it.	O ne a sa batle ho e botsa.
It should be the same here.	Ho lokela hore ho be joalo le mona.
But no one wanted to see it.	Empa ho ne ho se motho ya batlang ho e bona.
I had never seen anything like it.	Ke ne ke qala ho bona ntho e kang bona.
I do not think.	ha ke nahane.
Or to me.	Kapa ho nna.
Stay with them.	Lula u le teng le bona.
Certainly, they may not be.	Ka sebele, ba ka ’na ba se ke ba ba joalo.
We did not know what to do.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na re etse eng.
You will have to get out.	U tla tlameha ho tsoa.
You will need to talk to her doctor.	U tla hloka ho bua le ngaka ea hae.
I may not be that strong.	Nka 'na ka se be matla hakaalo.
I had never been with me or my past life.	Ke ne ke e-s'o be le 'na kapa bophelo ba ka morao.
What you say does not make it so.	Seo u se buang ha se etse hore ho be joalo.
But it is because they are not.	Empa ke hobane ha ba joalo.
I can write from time to time but maybe not.	Nka ngola nako le nako empa mohlomong ha ho joalo.
This did not do it when it was new.	Sena ha sea ka sa e etsa ha e ne e le ncha.
He's been trying to get it, though.	Esale a leka ho e fumana, leha ho le jwalo.
I have done this before.	Ke entse sena pele.
However, it does exist.	Leha ho le joalo, e teng.
They don't want to.	Ha ba batle.
He can do the same for you today.	A ka u etsetsa se tšoanang kajeno.
This is what will happen now.	Sena ke se tla etsahala joale.
He rode his bicycle to work.	O ne a palama baesekele ho ea mosebetsing.
You can get anything.	U ka fumana eng kapa eng.
The time to apply was near.	Nako ea ho etsa kopo e ne e le haufi.
I slept there for hours.	Ke ile ka robala moo lihora tse ngata.
We cannot thank you enough.	Ha re khone ho u leboha ka ho lekaneng.
I suspect you have a lot of your money.	Ke belaela hore u na le chelete e ngata ea hau.
I'm fine.	Ke phela hantle.
Really good.	Ka sebele e ntle.
Your mind is not a guilty person.	Kelello ea hau ha se motho ea molato.
The police denied any wrongdoing.	Mapolesa a hana taba leha e le efe.
I can't speak right now.	Ha ke khone ho bua hona joale.
This went on for hours.	Sena se ile sa nka lihora tse ngata.
She is his wife.	Ke mosali oa hae.
She cried as she thought of the past.	O ile a lla ha a ntse a nahana ka lintho tse fetileng.
But it worked.	Empa ho ile ha thusa.
But money would be fun.	Empa chelete e ne e tla ba monate.
That would be fun.	Hoo ho ka ba monate.
And you can't do anything.	'Me u ke ke ua etsa letho.
And he loves it.	'Me oa e rata.
I knew him well.	Ke ne ke mo tseba hantle.
He was too big.	O ne a le moholo haholo.
Sometimes it worked.	Ka linako tse ling e ne e sebetsa.
He does not talk about them.        	Ha a bue ka tsona.        
I'll take you to that.	Ke tla o nka ka taba eo.
It's easy, really.	Ho bonolo, ruri.
And it would be.	Mme ho ne ho tla ba jwalo.
Really good question.	Potso e ntle ruri.
But no, I do not know what I am.	Empa che, ha ke tsebe seo ke leng sona.
I like good food.	Ke rata lijo tse monate.
And it would be good.	'Me ho ka ba hantle.
Because he still loved the way he felt.	Hobane o ne a ntse a rata tsela eo a neng a ikutloa ka eona.
What are we going to eat tonight?	Re tla ja eng bosiung bona?
He had never done this before.	O ne a eso ho ka a etsa sena pele.
I will not let him go.	Nke ke ka mo tlohela.
Most of the people there did not know that he was there.	Batho ba bangata ba moo ba ne ba sa tsebe hore o teng.
No one spoke at the party.	Ho ne ho se motho ea ileng a bua moketeng oo.
It was a very good thing.	E ne e le ntho e ntle haholo.
I played with a few of them and they looked really good.	Ke ile ka bapala le tse 'maloa tsa tsona' me li ne li bonahala li le ntle haholo.
Well, he's better where he is.	Be, o betere moo a leng teng.
They had never talked about money before.	Ba ne ba e-s'o ka ba bua ka chelete pele.
He considered her beautiful.	O ne a mo nka a le motle.
We will never again be able to treat people this way.	Re ke ke ra hlola re khona ho tšoara batho ka tsela ena.
And what he noticed, he noticed.	Mme seo a ileng a se hlokomela, o ile a se hlokomela.
We paid him.	Ra mo lefa.
I could not let him go.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho mo lumella hore a tsamaee.
She may like it.	A ka e rata.
I fell in love with her.	Ke ile ka qala ho mo rata haholo.
After that comes another.	Ka morao ho eona ho tla e ’ngoe.
You only come at the end.	U tla feela qetellong.
He knew he had not found her.	O ne a tseba hore ha a so mo fumane.
It only looks good when you do.	E shebahala hantle feela ha o etsa joalo.
I have a few.	Ke na le tse 'maloa.
You're done.	O qetile.
Too easy after that.	Ho ba bonolo haholo ka mor'a moo.
It would take days.	Ho ne ho tla nka matsatsi.
So, find out what they think about your content.	Kahoo, fumana hore na ba nahana eng ka litaba tsa hau.
But he was not holding the phone.	Empa o ne a sa tšoara mohala.
To do this.	Hore u etse sena.
You know, often.	Ua tseba, hangata.
But my point is that you now have friends.	Empa taba ea ka ke hore joale u na le metsoalle.
It hurts so much for them.	Ho bohloko haholo bakeng sa bona.
It was the best thing we could do.	E ne e le ntho e molemo ka ho fetisisa eo re ka e etsang.
I think that is enough.	Ke nahana hore e lekana.
But! 	Empa!
in the end.	qetellong.
Do you study?	A na ua ithuta?
I can't comment.	Ha ke khone ho fana ka maikutlo.
I have to see if the path is clear.	Ke tlameha ho bona hore na tsela e hlakile.
But you are also human.	Empa le wena o motho.
I will not let you see my son.	Nke ke ka u lumella ho bona mora oa ka.
Thank you so much for everything !.	Ke leboha haholo ka tsohle!.
We all wonder.	Kaofela rea ​​ipotsa.
She enjoys writing and reading.	O thabela ho ngola le ho bala.
This is just water.	Mona ke metsi feela.
That's what you need.	Ke seo u se hlokang.
She is a woman.	Ke mosali.
Nice to meet you, man.	Ke thabela ho kopana le wena, monna.
Money, he says.	Chelete, o re.
However, you do not.	Leha ho le joalo, ha u etse joalo.
We are ashamed.	Re lihlong.
It is safe to ask.	Ha ho kotsi ho botsa.
That has never happened before.	Seo ha se eso be teng pele.
This only works.	Sena se sebetsa feela.
He led a simple life.	O ne a phela bophelo bo thata le bo bonolo.
But don't say it.	Empa u se ke ua e bua.
The phone rings in the bedroom.	Mohala oa lla ka kamoreng ea ho robala.
Something had to offer.	Ntho e 'ngoe e ne e tlameha ho fana.
He was a father.	E ne e le ntate.
I just find it hard to talk.	Ke mpa ke fumana ho le thata ho bua.
More than just danger.	Ho feta kotsi feela.
If you do not want to talk about it right now, we will not do that.	Haeba u sa batle ho bua ka eona hona joale, re ke ke ra etsa joalo.
I had not seen him in thirty years.	Ke ne ke e-s'o mo bone ka lilemo tse mashome a mararo.
He was nowhere to be found.	O ne a se kae kapa kae.
I just believe she must be her mother.	Ke lumela feela hore e tlameha ebe ke eena 'mè oa hae.
My mother lives	'Mè o lula
Every day he came.	Letsatsi le letsatsi o ne a tla.
It was my thing.	E ne e le ntho ea ka.
We would both do the same.	Ka bobeli re ne re tla etsa joalo.
I can't speak right now.	Ha ke khone ho bua hona joale.
I knew that was a long time.	Ke ne ke tseba hore hoo e ne e le nako e telele.
Maybe they know where he went.	Mohlomong ba tseba moo a ileng teng.
However, it could be a start again.	Leha ho le joalo, e ka ba ho qala hape.
He did not even try to sleep.	Ha aa ka a leka le ho robala.
Their money.	Chelete ea bona.
I like things like that.	Ke rata lintho tse joalo.
It's just looking for you.	Ke ho batla uena feela.
He wanted to be that boy.	O ne a batla ho ba moshanyana eo.
He stated that he had no problem drinking.	O ile a bolela hore ha a na bothata ba ho noa.
That's the first thing.	Ke ntho ya pele.
You must be able to do your job.	U tlameha ho ba le matla a ho etsa mosebetsi oa hau.
We did not meet.	Ha rea ​​kopana.
I'm sure someone can find them.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore motho a ka li fumana.
I can no longer feel that way, man.	Ha ke sa khona ho ikutloa joalo hape, monna.
He has spent his whole life here!	O qetile bophelo bohle ba hae mona!
I think he was hurt.	Ke nahana hore o utloile bohloko.
He went on living.	A tsoela pele ho phela.
You can do what you want.	U ka etsa seo u se batlang.
People find their way here.	Batho ba fumana tsela ea bona mona.
There will be no more.	Ha ho sa tla hlola ho e-ba teng.
You will be in the high school team.	O tla ba sehlopheng sa sehlopha sa sekolo se phahameng.
I don't think they knew anything.	Ha ke nahane hore ba ne ba tseba letho.
Once this was life.	Hang ha sena e ne e le bophelo.
He had to do something, but there was nothing good he could do.	O ne a lokela ho etsa ho hong, empa ho ne ho se letho le molemo leo a ka le etsang.
To me that’s what’s mine.	Ho 'na ke seo e leng sa ka.
He does not want to go.	Ha a batle ho tsamaea.
However, it was not the first.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se ea pele.
I don't think they are.	Ha ke nahane hore ba joalo.
But there was no one.	Empa ho ne ho se na eena.
This is the fourth question.	Ena ke potso ea bone.
I do it right.	Ke e etsa hantle.
For a long time, no one said anything.	Ka nako e telele, ha ho motho ea ileng a bua letho.
But there is more.	Empa ho na le taba e 'ngoe hape.
Who was absent.	Ke mang ea neng a le sieo.
I was very happy to do it.	Ke ne ke thabetse haholo ho e etsa.
He was glad he didn't.	O ne a thabetse hore ebe ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
He will fit right in.	O tla kena hantle.
These are amazing times.	Tsena ke linako tse makatsang.
We can no longer meet with everyone.	Ha re sa khona ho kopana le batho bohle.
I can't see it.	Ha ke o bone.
The end time is near.	Nako ea ho qetela e haufi.
I think we can take it from here.	Ke nahana hore re ka e nka ho tloha mona.
She has no good feelings.	Ha a na maikutlo a monate.
This is not a matter of opinion.	Sena ha se taba ea maikutlo.
Probably worth it.	Mohlomong ke ea bohlokoa.
Just know that it is.	Tseba feela hore ho joalo.
I can't.	Ha ke khone.
They may thank you in the end !.	Ba ka 'na ba u leboha qetellong!.
This time it does not matter.	Nako ena ha e na taba.
And she is usually her husband.	'Me hangata ke monna oa hae.
Nothing, but it's still morning.	Ha ho letho, empa e sa le hoseng.
We need it now.	Re e hloka hona joale.
No one, never.	Ha ho motho, le ka mohla.
However, the problem is premature.	Leha ho le joalo, bothata ke pele ho nako.
And that is exactly what is happening now.	Mme ke sona hantle se etsahalang jwale.
But I did not know what it meant.	Empa ha ke a fumana hore na e bolela eng.
Certainly not.	Ka sebele e ne e ke ke ea khona.
But it was too late.	Empa e ne e se e le morao haholo.
That's how good he is.	Ke kamoo a leng molemo kateng.
He had to leave there.	O ne a lokela ho tloha moo.
I got some food and gave it to him.	Ke ile ka fumana lijo eaba ke mo fa.
I say we leave that night.	Ke re re tloha bosiung boo.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
Everyone is doing it now.	Bohle ba e etsa jwale.
Everyone would agree.	Bohle ba ne ba tla lumela.
That meant something.	E neng e bua ho hong.
I'm very happy for you.	Ke o thabetse haholo.
It wanted what it wanted.	E ne e batla seo e se batlang.
They have another chance to fix it.	Ba na le monyetla o mong hape oa ho e lokisa.
I had to get to school on time.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho fihla ka nako sekolong.
You made your point.	U entse taba ea hau.
So it could be someone else.	Kahoo e ka ba motho e mong.
However, the problem lies in finding a way to get him.	Leha ho le joalo, bothata bo na le mokhoa oa ho mo fumana.
It's somewhere.	E sebakeng se seng.
I'm sure we were wrong there, too.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore re bile le phoso moo, le rona.
You have no idea.	Ha o na mohopolo.
I'm just looking around.	Ke ntse ke sheba feela.
Moreover, they look very nice.	Ho feta moo, li shebahala li le ntle haholo.
Too many more to read.	Tse ling tse ngata haholo ho li bala.
I have a question too.	Le 'na ke na le potso.
Nothing serious.	Letho la bohlokoa.
Eventually he will arrive.	Qetellong o tla fihla.
Yes, we will continue.	E, re tla tsoela pele.
This is not going to be good.	Sena ha se na ho ba ntle.
Or it could be something else.	Kapa e ka ba ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Look at the picture carefully.	Sheba setšoantšo ka hloko.
This is not your time.	Ha se nako ea hau.
However, it is still moving.	Leha ho le joalo, e ntse e tsamaea.
He was busy.	O ne a phathahane.
Obviously this is not the case.	Ho hlakile hore sena ha se joalo.
There was no way he could do that.	Ho ne ho se kamoo a ka etsang seo kateng.
I thought he was playing and he didn't know any more.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o ntse a bapala mme ha a tsebe ho feta.
I'm waiting for you.	Ke u emetse.
Good for us.	Molemo ho rona.
Obviously, that will not happen.	Ho hlakile hore seo se ke ke sa etsahala.
Then he noticed the book.	Eaba o hlokomela buka eo.
This is old.	Sena ke sa khale.
There were parents here too.	Ho ne ho e-na le batsoali le mona.
It obviously has money.	Ho hlakile hore e na le chelete.
He knew that.	O ne a tseba seo.
I was not thinking of anything else.	Ke ne ke sa nahane ka letho le leng.
So this is an idea.	Kahoo ona ke mohopolo.
You can play with all this you want.	U ka bapala ka sena sohle seo u se batlang.
But it still doesn't matter to me.	Empa e ntse e se taba le nna.
But he was done.	Empa o ne a se a qetile.
That goes for everyone.	Seo se ea ho bohle.
Then leave the room.	Ebe o tloha kamoreng.
I thought he did a really good job there.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o entse mosebetsi o motle haholo moo.
It is the last chance.	Ke monyetla oa ho qetela.
He didn't care.	O ne a sa tsotelle seo.
So this is what you would do.	Kahoo sena ke seo u neng u tla se etsa.
That's just fine.	Ke hantle feela.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka bonolo.
I didn’t know he had to have it.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore o tlameha ho ba le eona.
Stop, maybe not one of them.	Ema, mohlomong e se e 'ngoe ea tsona.
He suggests things.	O fana ka maikutlo a lintho.
So it keeps eating.	Kahoo e tsoela pele ho ja.
But it is not easy.	Empa ha ho bonolo.
It was really almost weird.	E ne e hlile e batla e le ntho e makatsang.
Then my mind cried.	Eaba kelello ea ka ea lla.
We are probably too many.	Mohlomong re ba bangata haholo.
Take it one day at a time.	E nke letsatsi le le leng ka nako.
As a result, it feels fresh and fun too.	Ka lebaka leo, e ikutloa e le ncha le e monate hape.
And don’t tell me you can’t imagine why.	'Me u se ke ua mpolella hore u ke ke ua nahana hore na ke hobane'ng.
Time to do something.	Nako ea ho etsa ho hong.
You have nothing.	Ha u na letho.
No, he was a human.	Che, e ne e le motho.
But he always denied that.	Empa kamehla o ne o hana seo.
You have to go.	U tlameha ho tsamaea.
Maybe he's one of them.	Mohlomong ke e mong oa bona.
And we do not expect them to be.	Hape ha rea ​​lebella hore ba tla ba joalo.
They haven't got it yet.	Ha ba so ba fumane.
He says no one likes him.	O bolela hore ha ho motho ea mo ratang.
Of course he knew.	Ehlile o ne a tseba.
That is a fact of life.	Eo ke 'nete ea sebele.
I'm trying to get to where you are.	Ke ntse ke leka ho palama ho fihla moo o leng teng.
Plan for future work.	Rera mosebetsi oa nako e tlang.
I've heard that now.	Ke utloile seo hona joale.
I do not understand why we are doing this.	Ha ke utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha re etsa sena.
That should not have been the case.	Seo se ne se sa lokela ho ba joalo.
One that is sometimes difficult to maintain.	E 'ngoe eo ka linako tse ling ho leng thata ho e boloka.
She is still happy.	O ntse a thabile.
It looks new.	E shebahala e le ncha.
If only there was a way out.	Hoja ho ne ho ka ba le tsela ea ho tsoa.
But so far there was no chance at all.	Empa ho fihlela joale ho ne ho se na monyetla ho hang.
I can only say.	Nka bolela feela.
He was the only one who did it.	E ne e le eena feela ea e entseng.
They didn't know how many more times they could have like this.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe hore na ba ka ba le linako tse kae hape tse kang tsena.
He really loves you.	O hlile oa u rata.
The problem was that he was denying it.	Bothata e ne e le hore o ne a hana taba eo.
I really enjoyed it.	Ke ile ka e thabela haholo.
I have to go.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
No one else did.	Ha ho le ea mong ea ileng a etsa joalo.
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
He left immediately after you did so.	O ile a tloha hang ka mor'a hore u etse joalo.
I think I am one of the best.	Ke nahana hore ke e mong oa ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
I mean we work hard.	Ke bolela hore re sebetsa ka thata.
That is the hardest part.	Ke eona ntho e thata haholo.
I finished a little.	Ke ile ka qeta hanyane.
My father had to read with me.	Ntate o ne a lokela ho bala le ’na.
It was his life.	E ne e le bophelo ba hae.
But he takes it very seriously.	Empa o nka ka thata haholo.
But he said instead.	Empa o ile a re ho e-na le hoo.
It was one person.	E ne e le motho a le mong.
Someone you should not trust! 	Motho e mong eo u sa lokelang ho mo tšepa!
Or so he thought.	Kapa o ile a nahana joalo.
.	.
No, nothing tonight.	Che, ha ho letho bosiung bona.
He would be an expert.	E ne e tla ba setsebi.
She is a teacher, and she loves her job.	Ke tichere, 'me o rata mosebetsi oa hae.
Just take it.	E nke feela.
He never said much about you.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua haholo ka uena.
We need more.	Re hloka tse ling.
The time will come.	Nako e tla tla.
He worked long hours of loneliness.	O ne a sebetsa lihora tse telele tsa bolutu.
I just gave him a problem.	Ke ne ke mpa ke mo fa bothata.
I work hard.	Ke sebetsa haholo.
I did not ask for it.	Ha kea e botsa.
Maybe they are just as happy where they are.	Mohlomong ba thabile joalo feela moo ba leng teng.
This is not the case.	Sena ha se joalo.
Please let us talk about people.	Ke kopa re bue ka batho.
It does not matter how many items you have.	Ha se taba ea hore na u na le lintho tse kae.
We never had a lot of money.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra ba le chelete e ngata.
He is not a man.	Ha se motho.
And every day of my life was at stake.	Mme letsatsi le leng le le leng la bophelo ba ka le ne le le kotsing.
Sometimes you are in the back, sometimes you are in the front.	Ka nako e 'ngoe u ka morao, ka nako e 'ngoe u le ka pele.
Thirty years is a long time.	Lilemo tse mashome a mararo ke nako e telele.
He could not reach her.	O ne a sa khone ho mo fihlela.
You can always comment after you have received any suggestions.	U ka lula u fana ka maikutlo ka mor'a hore u fumane tlhahiso leha e le efe.
I have to thank you for everything.	Ke tlameha ho le leboha ka tsohle.
Let him go and.	A mpe a tsamaee 'me.
This is the way we should do it.	Ena ke tsela eo re lokelang ho e etsa ka eona.
It so happened that they were at my house.	Ho ile ha etsahala hore ba be ba le ha ka.
Well, they're calling.	Be, ba ntse ba letsa.
I can't reach him.	Ke se ke ka mo fihlela.
You did not request it.	Ha o a e kopa.
Of course, all is well.	Ha e le hantle, tsohle li joalo.
No, he did not.	Che, ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
This is the last chance.	Ona ke monyetla oa ho qetela.
I would never speak to one of them again.	Ke ne nke ke ka hlola ke bua le e mong oa bona hape.
What it is today.	Ke eng kajeno.
Or both.	Kapa ka bobeli ba bona.
But they did not care.	Empa ba ne ba sa tsotelle.
It would cost money to see them again next year.	Ho ne ho tla hlokahala chelete ho bona hape selemong se tlang.
Only children.	Ke bana feela.
So they decide not to come.	Kahoo ba etsa qeto ea hore ba se ke ba tla.
I'm glad you're here with me.	Ke thabela ha o le mona le nna.
He stated that there is no such law.	O ile a bolela hore ha ho na molao o joalo.
Instead of getting.	Ho ena le ho fumana.
I did not tell anyone.	Ha kea ka ka bolella motho.
But it does happen.	Empa ho a etsahala.
You may have been there before.	Mohlomong u kile ua ba teng.
But that did not happen.	Empa seo ha sea ka sa etsahala.
The difficult question is what can we achieve.	Potso e thata ke hore na re ka fihlela eng.
You can go with whatever you want.	U ka tsamaea le eng kapa eng eo u e batlang.
He said it was dangerous.	A re ke kotsi.
Surely, he would have liked this very much.	Ka sebele, a ka be a ile a rata sena haholo.
I can't get enough.	Ha ke khone ho lekana.
My parents would not understand.	Batsoali ba ka ba ke ke ba utloisisa.
You can tell me about this place.	O ka mpolella ka sebaka sena.
We need to finish this.	Re hloka ho qeta sena.
What a man.	Monna ea joang.
That would be my father.	Eo e ka ba ntate oa ka.
I know this would not be enough.	Kea tseba hore sena se ka be se sa lekana.
I know how to know.	Ke tseba ho tseba.
We did not know what to do.	Re ne re sa tsebe seo re lokelang ho se etsa.
But he knew that was not the case.	Empa o ne a tseba hore ha ho joalo.
But I have never found it.	Empa ha ke so e fumane.
I did not find anything.	Ha kea fumana letho.
That is the first one.	Ke eona ea pele.
We make friends fast.	Re etsa metsoalle kapele.
It will never happen.	Ha ho mohla ho tla etsahala.
I mean, look at your situation.	Ke bolela, sheba boemo ba hao.
His family treated him just fine.	Lelapa la hae le ne le mo tšoara hantle feela.
My whole family will do it.	Lelapa la ka kaofela le tla e etsa.
But we are not.	Empa ha re joalo.
That's what we like to have.	Ke seo re ratang ho ba le sona.
Not at all.	Ho hang ha ho joalo.
I will not leave here.	Nke ke ka tloha mona.
It can happen.	E ka etsahala.
Love it so much.	E rate ka thata.
But it may seem more than that.	Empa ho ka bonahala eka ho feta moo.
They agreed to help her.	Ba ile ba lumela ho mo thusa.
We will not be able to eat your food today.	Re ke ke ra khona ho ja ha hau kajeno.
They are always beautiful and easy to make.	Li lula li le ntle 'me ho bonolo ho li etsa.
It was not easy to find that place.	Ho ne ho se bonolo ho fumana sebaka seo.
Eventually they would thank him.	Qetellong ba ne ba tla mo leboha.
Use your mind and things should go smoothly.	Sebelisa kelello ea hau 'me lintho li lokela ho tsamaea hantle.
Thank you so much for the opportunity to come back.	Ke leboha haholo monyetla oa ho khutla.
I love the baby.	Ke rata ngoana.
You may have to be that way.	U ka tlameha ho ba joalo.
The application process is simple.	Mokhoa oa kopo o bonolo.
If not, read it first.	Haeba ho se joalo, bala pele.
So wrong.	Ka hona phoso.
I have never heard anything like that.	Le ’na ha kea ka ka utloa letho la mofuta oo.
However, make no mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, u se ke ua etsa phoso.
He is life to me.	O bophelo ho nna.
We have no children.	Ha re na bana.
Food was just what he needed first.	Lijo ke tsona tseo a neng a li hloka pele.
Go ahead with it.	Tsoela pele ka eona.
I do not know.	Ha ke tsebe.
His wife died last year.	Mosali oa hae o ile a hlokahala selemong se fetileng.
This has never happened before.	Sena ha se e-so ka se etsahala.
I did with it.	Ke entse ka eona.
Tomorrow you will find a boy.	Hosane o tla fumana moshanyana.
People still need to eat.	Batho ba ntse ba hloka ho ja.
He did not know how long.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke nako e kae.
We had to spend a good time with him.	Re ile ra tlameha ho qeta nako e monate ea letsatsi le eena.
His life was a book.	Bophelo ba hae e ne e le buka.
One day, she may learn to use them.	Ka letsatsi le leng, e ka ithuta ho li sebelisa.
But, most people write more than they think.	Empa, batho ba bangata ba ngola ho feta kamoo ba nahanang kateng.
It seemed clear that they believed that something had happened.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho hlakile hore ba lumela hore ho na le ntho e etsahetseng.
Water is one of the best things.	Metsi ke e 'ngoe ea lintho tse molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He wanted to be both.	O ne a batla ho ba bobeli.
Another weird thing for me.	Taba e 'ngoe e makatsang bakeng sa ka.
That is, one has.	Ke hore, motho o na le.
They will come to you.	Ba tla tla ho wena.
It's really beautiful.	E ntle ruri.
He was a child.	E ne e le ngoana.
But they got help.	Empa ba ile ba fumana thuso.
I knew the truth would come out in the end.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ’nete e tla bonahala qetellong.
At the time, we were thrilled.	Ka nako eo re ne re thabile.
I need everyone there.	Ke hloka bohle moo.
It was dangerous.	E ne e le kotsi.
Come back.	Khutla.
Very good, indeed.	E ntle haholo, ka 'nete.
Some hours maybe.	Lihora tse ling mohlomong.
Some people don't care about this right now.	Batho ba bang ha ba na taba le sena hona joale.
They are more likely to be friends.	Ho ka etsahala hore e be metsoalle.
Or it could be.	Kapa ho ka ba joalo.
It's a very interesting feeling.	Ke maikutlo a monate haholo.
He asked only questions.	O ile a botsa lipotso feela.
But we still could not find it.	Empa re ne re e-s'o khone ho e fumana.
What was his name?	Lebitso la hae e ne e le mang.
What you will do.	Seo u tla se etsa.
I was not looking at his shoes.	Ke ne ke sa sheba lieta tsa hae.
Do they have money?	Na ba na le chelete?
They had no children.	Ba ne ba se na bana.
That should be very helpful.	Seo se lokela ho thusa haholo.
I could hear it, even before it happened.	Ke ne ke khona ho e utloa, le pele e etsahala.
The first method is very simple.	Mokhoa oa pele o bonolo haholo.
However, their children have nothing.	Leha ho le joalo, bana ba bona ha ba na letho.
I do not want him.	Ha ke mo batle.
You have to pay now.	U tlameha ho lefa hona joale.
I know they no longer live there.	Kea tseba hore ha ba sa lula moo.
Then try one day a week.	Ebe u leka letsatsi le le leng ka beke.
Doing well in school seems easy.	Ho sebetsa hantle sekolong ho bonahala ho le bonolo.
Finally, he met.	Qetellong, o ile a kopana.
I'm glad you're finally here.	Ke thabetse hore qetellong u teng.
It is also not good.	Hape ha e ntle.
It's easy.	Ho bonolo.
As a result.	Kahoo.
I do not know now.	Ha ke tsebe hona joale.
They want something real.	Ba batla ntho ya sebele.
It's beautiful this way.	E ntle ka tsela ena.
No, not at all.	Che, ha ho joalo ka 'nete.
It was useless for that.	Ho ne ho se thuso ho seo.
We are leaving tomorrow.	Re tsamaea hosane.
It's our time.	Ke nako ea rona.
Here is my favorite book.	Buka eo ke e ratang haholo ke ena.
I am very happy for him.	Ke thabile haholo bakeng sa hae.
I think the idea works.	Ke nahana hore mohopolo oa sebetsa.
This was his life.	Bona e ne e le bophelo ba hae.
They have one car.	Ba na le koloi e le 'ngoe.
We need to do better.	Re hloka ho etsa betere.
I am an individual.	Ke motho ka mong.
The second is very dangerous.	Ea bobeli e kotsi haholo.
I just love living my life.	Ke rata ho phela bophelo ba ka feela.
This tells us a few things.	Sena se re bolella lintho tse seng kae.
He did not know his power.	O ne a sa tsebe matla a hae.
They have children.	Ba na le bana.
This rule applies at any time.	Molao ona o sebetsa neng kapa neng.
He's an emotional guy.	Ke mohlankana ea nang le maikutlo.
So sometimes it can be fun.	Kahoo ka linako tse ling ho ka ba monate.
I loved going there.	Ke ne ke rata ho ea moo.
To eat him alive.	Ho mo ja a phela.
So it is you.	Kahoo ke uena.
He just plays it all.	O bapala tsohle feela.
He could not, but he wanted to.	Le eena o ne a ka se khone, empa o ne a batla.
You start to trust what they say.	U qala ho tšepa seo ba se buang.
They do not seem to care about it at all.	Ho bonahala eka ha ba na taba le lona ho hang.
The boy was very happy.	Moshanyana eo o ne a thabile haholo.
This means you can't get in your way.	Sena se bolela hore ha o khone ho kena ka tsela ea hau.
Days pass.	Matsatsi aa feta.
We just have to get it.	Re tlameha feela ho e fumana.
That's right here.	Ho joalo mona.
He certainly is not sure if he can do this.	Ehlile ha a na bonnete ba hore a ka etsa sena.
That has never been the case.	Hoo ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba 'nete.
I drove for several hours.	Ke ile ka khanna lihora tse 'maloa.
But he never did anything.	Empa ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa letho.
And it is not.	Mme ha ho jwalo.
Which did not seem like an easy task.	E neng e sa bonahale e le mosebetsi o bonolo.
And life is good.	Mme bophelo bo monate.
I really am.	Ke hlile ke joalo.
He did not tell me.	O ne a sa mpolella.
But it was getting back.	Empa ho ne ho se ho khutlela morao.
Of course, they do not like such a thing.	Ha e le hantle, ha ba rate ntho e joalo.
That's a good job.	Ke mosebetsi o motle oo.
That’s how this decision was for me.	Ke kamoo qeto ena e neng e le kateng ho 'na.
But then they were.	Empa joale ba ne ba le joalo.
And to all.	Le ho bohle.
We found this.	Re fumane sena.
It was hard for them.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bona.
They need to think again.	Ba lokela ho nahana hape.
What is tens.	Mashome ke eng .
I will never forget him.	Nke ke ka mo lebala.
I really enjoyed it.	Ruri ke e thabetse.
They kept the group together.	Ba ile ba boloka sehlopha hammoho.
To be simple.	Ho ba bonolo.
Very nice place.	Sebaka se setle haholo.
Be tough times.	E be linako tse thata.
Unless it is.	Ntle le hore ho joalo.
It looked surprisingly bad.	E ile ea bonahala e se mpe ka mokhoa o makatsang.
There is no other help for him.	Ha ho na thuso e 'ngoe ho eena.
This will make it easier to maintain.	Sena se tla etsa hore ho be bonolo ho boloka.
Sometimes he was able to help, and sometimes he couldn’t.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a khona ho thusa, ’me ka linako tse ling o ne a sa khone.
All but anything.	Tsohle ntle le eng kapa eng.
But it did not.	Empa ha ea ka ea etsa joalo.
Do not use them.	U se ke ua li sebelisa.
His wife loved life.	Mosali oa hae o ne a rata bophelo.
I hope this was fun.	Ke tšepa hore sena se ne se le monate.
She was so beautiful.	O ne a le motle haholo.
Then we will be equal.	Joale re tla be re lekana.
He did not want to give any of this.	O ne a sa batle ho fana ka letho la sena.
When one of the best goes, it is hard to comprehend.	Ha e 'ngoe ea tse ntle ka ho fetisisa e ea, ho thata ho e utloisisa.
Think like the others.	Nahana joaloka ba bang.
You will take care of him.	U tla mo hlokomela.
I know it's just a matter of time.	Kea tseba hore ke taba ea nako feela.
But nothing is easy here.	Empa ha ho letho le bonolo mona.
It just plays that way.	E mpa feela e bapala ka tsela eo.
Of course, we are not.	Ha e le hantle, ha re eo.
I just started.	Ke sa tsoa qala.
I can't give you anything.	Ha ke khone ho u fa letho.
Just think of today.	Nahana feela ka kajeno.
He obviously has never done that before.	Ho hlakile hore ha a e-s’o etse joalo.
I like the police.	Ke rata mapolesa.
However, nothing should be here.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho letho le lokelang ho ba teng mona.
.	.
Some are good and some are bad.	Tse ling li ntle le tse ling tse mpe.
So we picked up the phone.	Kahoo re ile ra nka mohala.
Without my fault.	Ntle le phoso ea ka.
That's where we'll ride back.	Ke moo re tla palama ho khutla.
I was wearing it.	Ke ne ke e apere.
He would use that.	O ne a tla sebelisa seo.
I had never heard of him.	Ke ne ke qala ho utloa ka eena.
It is necessary to look at the whole picture.	Ho hlokahala ho sheba setšoantšo sohle.
So the question is, how?	Joale potso ke hore, joang?
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
He really works hard.	Ruri o sebetsa ka thata.
Make more money.	Etsa chelete e ngata le ho feta.
I do not need to read anything.	Ha ke hloke ho bala letho.
Food works.	Lijo li sebetsa.
They are the most fun to play.	Ke tsona tse monate ho bapala.
You can do everything else with him, but don’t love him.	U ka etsa lintho tse ling tsohle le eena, empa u se ke ua mo rata.
As if there was not much error.	Joalo ka ha ho ne ho se na phoso e ngata.
This is their last chance.	Ona ke monyetla oa bona oa ho qetela.
I always wonder what will happen to us.	Ke lula ke nahana hore na ho tla etsahala eng ka rona.
I understand what is going on.	Ke utloisisa se etsahalang.
I feel so much better about using them now.	Ke ikutloa ke le betere haholo ka ho li sebelisa hona joale.
I just know it.	Ke e tseba feela.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
It was great to have them all here.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba le tsona kaofela mona.
Planning and commenting will keep you first.	Ho rera le ho fana ka maikutlo ho tla u boloka u le ba pele.
I'm glad you passed.	Ke thabela hore ebe u ile ua feta.
Thank you for finding it.	Kea leboha ha u e fumane.
Working my way back.	Ho sebetsa tsela ea ka ea ho khutla.
I did not receive my call.	Ha kea fumana mohala oa ka.
People don't get it.	Batho ha ba e fumane.
Many of them, many, many.	Ba bangata ba bona, ba bangata, ba bangata.
It worked the same way.	E ile ea sebetsa ka tsela e tšoanang.
He wants to meet you.	O batla ho kopana le wena.
He never liked it.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a o rata.
Of course you can stand in front of it.	Ha e le hantle u ka ema ka pele ho eona.
They could see everything clearly.	Ba ne ba bona tsohle hantle.
You need both to work.	U hloka bobeli ho sebetsa.
With regard to the girl's affairs, we no longer need her.	Ka litaba tsa ngoanana, ha re sa mo hloka.
We have life and a team.	Re na le bophelo le sehlopha.
I need clothes.	Ke hloka liaparo.
Obviously there is something.	Ho hlakile hore ho na le ntho e itseng.
People could look, but they could not see him.	Batho ba ne ba ka sheba, empa ba ne ba ke ke ba mo bona.
They did not eat for days.	Ba ile ba qeta matsatsi ba sa je.
I said no.	Ke ile ka re che.
There was no water.	Ho ne ho se na metsi.
That should mean something.	Seo se lokela ho bolela ho hong.
He's just a boy, really.	Ke moshanyana feela, ka 'nete.
They thought.	Ba ile ba nahana.
Adequate room should be a starting point.	Kamore e lekaneng e lokela ho ba sebaka sa ho qala.
Pain he knew.	Bohloko o ne a tseba.
So tired .	Ke khathetse hona hoo .
I would love to do more fun things.	Nka rata ho etsa lintho tse monate ho feta.
The way out, he said.	Tsela ea ho tsoa, ​​o ile a re.
He spoke mentally.	O ile a bua ka kelello.
While this is good, we can still do better.	Leha sena se le ntle, re ntse re ka etsa betere.
He did not want to be like that.	O ne a sa batle ho ba jwalo.
No, he just wanted to watch.	Che, o ne a batla ho shebella feela.
He is very good.	O molemo haholo.
Last week before he died.	Bekeng e fetileng pele a hlokahala.
It soon became his life.	Kapele e ile ea e-ba bophelo ba hae.
It has already done the same thing.	E se e entse ntho e tšoanang.
My father had no idea.	Ntate o ne a se na maikutlo.
In the past, this was very difficult to do well.	Nakong e fetileng, sena se ne se le thata haholo ho se etsa hantle.
We notice these things all the time.	Re hlokomela lintho tsena ka linako tsohle.
Meet many to get the floor together.	Kopana le ba bangata ho fumana fatše hammoho.
Whatever happened, they knew.	Eng kapa eng e etsahetseng, ba ne ba tseba.
My son once said that to me.	Mora oa ka o kile a bua joalo ho 'na.
It is the past tense.	Ke nako e fetileng.
I did not like it.	Ha kea e rata.
They just come to me.	Ba tla ho 'na feela.
Some days it was easy.	Matsatsi a mang ho ne ho le bonolo.
If that is not true, then we are doing nothing.	Haeba le tsona e se 'nete, ha re etse letho.
That is why we are here.	Ke ka lebaka leo re leng mona.
It was fun then.	Ho ne ho le monate ka nako eo.
They will not help you.	Ba ke ke ba u thusa.
Like me, they were there to hear important news.	Joaloka ’na, ba ne ba le teng ho tla utloa litaba tsa bohlokoa.
You will be fine.	U tla phela hantle.
However, it is not him.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se eena.
What kind of food, how much food.	Lijo tsa mofuta ofe, lijo tse kae.
But he can't.	Empa ha a khone.
It is nothing new.	Ha se ntho e ncha.
And he got it.	Mme a e fumana.
Everyone loves amazing things.	E mong le e mong o rata lintho tse makatsang.
Stand back as much as you can, please.	Ema morao ka moo u ka khonang, ka kopo.
We hope you enjoy working with us !.	Re tšepa hore u tla thabela ho sebetsa le rona!.
Every house has a front door.	Ntlo e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le lemati le ka pele.
But the money is still flowing.	Empa chelete e ntse e tsoela pele.
You see strange but beautiful things there.	U bona lintho tse makatsang empa tse ntle moo.
Finally, he stepped back and looked at her one last time.	Qetellong, o ile a khutlela morao 'me a mo sheba ka lekhetlo la ho qetela.
We are friends, it is a good thing.	Re metsoalle, ke ntho e ntle.
You both look tired.	Ka bobeli le shebahala le khathetse.
He knew her well.	O ne a mo tseba hantle.
She wanted to go to school.	O ne a batla ho kena sekolo.
We spent hours talking about his work.	Re ile ra qeta lihora re bua ka mosebetsi oa hae.
It starts to refuse again.	E qala ho hana hape.
Some things were not so important, and some were even more important.	Lintho tse ling li ne li se bohlokoa hakaalo, ’me tse ling e le tsa bohlokoa haholoanyane.
Or 'just'.	Kapa 'feela'.
Then for dinner.	Joale ka lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I could not do them.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho li etsa.
I thought we would use your car.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re tla sebelisa koloi ea hau.
Che, che, che.	Che, che, che.
You are in danger of trying too hard to understand.	U kotsing ea ho leka ka matla ho utloisisa.
Somehow good.	Molemo ka tsela e itseng.
You may or may not like it.	U ka e rata kapa ha u e rate.
For people to see this happen.	Hore batho ba bone sena se etsahala.
It is better to have it.	Ho molemo hore e be le eona.
He thought he could help.	O ne a nahana hore a ka thusa.
Each has its time.	E 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le nako ea eona.
Then there is the final issue.	Ebe ho na le taba ea ho qetela.
Verify your work, and read it again.	Etsa bonnete ba mosebetsi oa hau, ebe u o bala hape.
Everyone has these.	E mong le e mong o na le tsena.
Few people have ever seen him.	Ke batho ba ’maloa ba kileng ba mo bona.
I tell them.	Kea ba bolella.
Your life is useless.	Bophelo ba hao ha bo na thuso.
Does anyone have any idea why this is happening.	Na ho na le motho ea nang le maikutlo a hore na hobaneng sena se etsahala.
He had just noticed it.	O ne a sa tsoa e hlokomela.
Also, try to write down everything that is good and bad.	Hape leka ho ngola ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ntle le e mpe.
But, you know,.	Empa, ua tseba,.
They had several children.	Ba ne ba e-na le bana ba ’maloa.
Make sure you keep it in a convenient place.	Etsa bonnete ba hore o e boloka e le sebakeng se bonolo.
Sometimes she feels very lonely.	Ka linako tse ling e ikutloa e le bolutu haholo.
There is something wrong with all of this.	Ho na le ntho e mpe ka tsena tsohle.
He felt so much better.	O ile a ikutloa a le betere haholo.
The same is true with your children.	Ho joalo le ka bana ba hau.
But I am alone.	Empa ke le mong.
Or it does not.	Kapa ha e etse.
However, you did not see any of that.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ua ka ua bona letho la seo.
Yes, that's probably it.	E, mohlomong ke eona eo.
In any form.	Ka mofuta ofe kapa ofe.
I doubt, but probably.	Ke belaela, empa mohlomong.
You do not know what to do.	Ha u tsebe hore na u etse eng.
If you like, we can do it here.	Haeba u rata, re ka e etsa mona.
This is not a mistake.	Sena ha se phoso.
We realized our mistake after it was too late.	Re ile ra hlokomela phoso ea rōna ka mor’a hore e se e le morao haholo.
I wish he had never done that.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka be a sa ka a etsa joalo.
What he went through would be very difficult for anyone.	Seo a fetileng ho sona se ne se tla ba thata haholo ho mang kapa mang.
Find out what you can do.	Fumana seo u ka se khonang.
They understood the process.	Ba ne ba utloisisa mokhoa oo.
He was doing well at the time.	O ne a sebetsa hantle ka nako eo.
But it is easier said than done.	Empa ho bonolo ho bua ho feta ho etsa.
I was thinking about that.	Ke ne ke nahana ka seo.
This is a difficult situation.	Ena ke boemo bo thata.
They did a great job.	Ba entse mosebetsi o moholo.
However, I understand why he fell.	Leha ho le joalo, kea utloisisa hore na ke hobane’ng ha a ile a oa.
But no, there it is.	Empa che, ke eo.
Maybe they made them not see you.	Mohlomong ba ile ba etsa hore ba se ke ba u bona.
They could have been.	Ba ka be ba bile.
I am writing my second book.	Ke ngola buka ea ka ea bobeli.
However, this is not necessarily true.	Leha ho le joalo, sena hase hakaalo hore ke ’nete.
However, he did not say so.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a ka a bua joalo.
I'll take his room.	Ke tla nka kamore ea hae.
Nobody wants to do this job.	Ha ho motho ea ratang ho etsa mosebetsi ona.
You speak when you are no longer fit.	U bua ha u sa lokela.
Another mistake.	Phoso e 'ngoe.
He thought it might be that person.	O ne a nahana hore mohlomong e ka ba motho eo.
Many people feel the same way now.	Batho ba bangata ba na le maikutlo a tšoanang hona joale.
So it came out.	Kahoo e ile ea tsoa.
You do not have to be an expert.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u be setsebi.
Be careful.	Hlokomela.
He speaks to them kindly.	O bua le bona hantle.
How much money do you have?	U na le chelete e kae ho uena?
I will not go.	nke ke ka tsamaea.
Name at the end.	Lebitso qetellong.
He's going tonight.	O ya bosiung bona.
The truth is clear.	'Nete e hlakile.
I heard him talking about the news of the day.	Ke ile ka utloa a ntse a bua ka litaba tsa letsatsi.
Another one you might like.	E 'ngoe eo u ka e ratang.
For us, it has never been a bad thing.	Ho rona, ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba ntho e mpe.
Too long, in my opinion it is not easy.	Nako e telele haholo, ka maikutlo a ka a seng bonolo.
What? 	Eng?
We had a great time and everyone was so much fun.	Re bile le nako e monate mme bohle ba ne ba le monate haholo.
Unless you want to go back to work.	Ntle le haeba u batla ho khutlela mosebetsing.
I'm very tired of them.	Ke khathetse haholo ke bona.
He said he would visit her.	O ile a re o tla mo etela.
I've been thinking about this for a long time.	Ke khale ke nahana ka taba ena.
But this can happen.	Empa sena se ka etsahala.
Even maybe not.	Leha mohlomong ha ho joalo.
But it was more.	Empa e ne e le ho feta.
His best chance was on the ground.	Monyetla oa hae o motle e ne e le oa fatše.
If that wasn't your case, just say so.	Haeba e ne e se taba ya hao, hantle feela o bue jwalo.
What a great way to achieve it.	Ke mokhoa ofe o motle oa ho o fihlela.
I mean that's what he thought.	Ke bolela hore ke seo a ileng a se nahana.
Like the day before.	Joalo ka letsatsi pele.
He is in you.	O ho wena.
I mean, a lot of money.	Ke bolela, chelete e ngata.
Probably.	Mohlomong.
They have to be better than they are.	Ba tlameha ho ba betere ho feta kamoo ba leng kateng.
He is not one of us.	Ha se e mong wa rona.
We need to do the same.	Le rōna re lokela ho etsa se tšoanang.
I did not know him before.	Ke ne ke sa mo tsebe ka pele.
I too did not take long.	Le 'na ha kea ka ka nka nako e telele.
There is no room.	Haho sebaka.
Have one and you want one and that way there is danger.	E-ba le e 'ngoe' me u batla e 'ngoe' me ka tsela eo kotsi e teng.
You will have to work on it every day.	U tla tlameha ho sebetsa ho eona letsatsi le leng le le leng.
The time is coming for us all.	Nako ea re tla kaofela.
I finally found the truth.	Qetellong ke ile ka fumana ’nete.
Which is nice, because they don't go anywhere.	Ke eng e ntle, hobane ha ba ee kae kapa kae.
It is the same with other people.	Ho joalo feela ka batho ba bang.
Someone has to start asking questions.	Motho e mong o lokela ho qala ho botsa lipotso.
As you wish.	Joalo ka ha u batla.
The night came.	Bosiu bo ile ba fihla.
He was not.	O ne a se jwalo.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
That's the way to do it.	Ke mokhoa oa ho e etsa.
It's a person, and a person.	Ke motho, le motho.
However, he never spoke to me again.	Leha ho le joalo ha aa ka a hlola a bua le 'na hape.
So, whatever you do.	Kahoo, eng kapa eng eo u e etsang.
Because he was.	Hobane o ne a le joalo.
And he just took it from you.	'Me o sa tsoa nka ho uena.
You will have a wonderful day tomorrow.	O tla ba le letsatsi le monate hosane.
I do not understand.	Ha ke utloisise.
I say nothing.	Ha ke bue letho.
I do not like this situation.	Ha ke rate boemo bona.
I went shopping.	Ke ile ka feta ho reka.
Unless it is.	Ntle le haeba ho le jwalo.
When they hear us, they are unable to fix our problems.	Ha ba re utloa, ba sitoa ho lokisa mathata a rōna.
They are obviously strong enough.	Ho hlakile hore ba matla ka ho lekaneng.
Only one.	O mong feela.
It's fun.	Ho monate.
Of course.	Ka 'nete.
It was difficult to find a job.	Ho ne ho le thata ho fumana mosebetsi.
It is usually not much.	Hangata ha e ngata.
He wanted to take it again.	O ne a batla ho e nka hape.
I have to help with that.	Ke lokela ho thusa ka seo.
Maybe you should try something.	Mohlomong u lokela ho leka ho hong.
She looked like she could cry.	O ne a shebahala eka a ka lla.
Leave with you now.	Tloha le uena joale.
This was very powerful.	Sena se ne se le matla haholo.
Probably better than that.	Mohlomong e betere ho feta moo.
I was very happy.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo.
It really is important.	Ehlile ke ea bohlokoa.
We have to catch them, we have to.	Re tlameha ho ba tšoara, re tlameha.
I just heard it recently.	Ke sa tsoa e utloa haufinyane.
I understand these people.	Ke utloisisa batho bana.
I can't find it now.	Ha ke e fumane hona joale.
His way.	Tsela ea hae.
Imagine if you are not.	Nahana ha u se uena.
I am sure every man does that.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore monna e mong le e mong o etsa joalo.
So we started work.	Kahoo re ile ra qala mosebetsi.
My father returned home from work.	Ntate o ile a khutlela hae a tsoa mosebetsing.
They want to play.	Ba batla ho bapala.
It doesn't make sense.	Ha e na kelello.
I'm thinking of taking a job here.	Ke nahana ho nka mosebetsi mona.
It was a very strange thing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang haholo.
Not to mention.	Re sa bue ka.
And she is about to cry.	'Me e se e tla lla.
We started at night.	Re ile ra qala bosiu.
But, therefore.	Empa, ka hona.
It happens to me.	E etsahala ho nna.
I just couldn't get enough of it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e lekana.
I do not know what to do first.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke etse eng pele.
Your wife, you love her.	Mosali oa hao, ua mo rata.
I don't know when it came out.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e tsoa neng.
Maybe someone else can.	Mohlomong motho e mong a ka khona.
Maybe I'll come back to find more.	Mohlomong ke tla khutla ho fumana tse ling tse ngata.
Next, go and see if a car is needed.	Ka mor'a moo, tsamaea 'me u bone hore na ho hlokahala koloi ea mofuta ofe.
Yet he did not understand.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a sa utloisise.
Let's go together.	Ha re tsamaee hammoho.
He was starting to look like his old self again.	O ne a se a qala ho shebahala joaloka motho oa hae oa khale hape.
She kept her money in shoes.	O ne a boloka chelete ea hae lieta.
I have never seen one.	Ha ke eso bone le le leng.
Sorry it didn't work, he said.	Ke masoabi ha ea sebetsa, o ile a re.
I feel empty.	Ke ikutloa ke se na letho.
Most people do not even want to know his name.	Batho ba bangata ha ba batle le ho tseba lebitso la hae.
It is a good book.	Ke buka e ntle.
I know what time it is.	Kea tseba hore na ke nako mang.
Things happen the way they happen.	Lintho li etsahala kamoo li etsahalang kateng.
It seemed easy.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le bonolo.
They should speak.	Ba lokela ho bua.
It's no use.	Ha ho na thuso.
However, there was.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le teng.
And that's it now.	Mme ke hona jwale.
I will think.	Ke tla nahana.
That looks great.	Seo se bonahala haholo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka eona.
Everything was very difficult.	Ntho eohle e ne e le thata haholo.
It was not easy to put on what she had to wear.	Ho ne ho se bonolo ho apara seo a neng a lokela ho se apara.
I need help.	Ke hloka thuso.
But, until now, everything seemed innocent.	Empa, ho fihlela joale, ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e bonahala e se na molato.
Life is life, food is only there.	Bophelo ke bophelo, lijo li teng feela.
I could have gone either way.	Nka be ke ile ka tsela efe kapa efe.
It was very hard work.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima haholo.
They always have something to say about everything.	Kamehla ba na le seo ba ka se buang ka ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
She knew she was beautiful.	O ne a tseba hore o motle.
I did not find out what happened next.	Ha kea ka ka fumana se ileng sa etsahala ka mor'a moo.
It was not good.	E ne e se ntle.
You know everything, but you know nothing.	U tseba ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe, empa ha u tsebe letho.
You don't have to, either.	Ha o sa tlameha, hape.
None of these are new.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsena e ncha.
It keeps it fun.	E etsa hore e lule e le monate.
We need to play better here.	Re hloka ho bapala betere mona.
I don't care what your name is.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na lebitso la hau ke mang.
It can't start.	E ke ke ea qala.
It hurts a lot.	Ho bohloko haholo.
Go ahead, look for the truth.	Tsoela pele, sheba 'nete.
I thought you wanted to go.	Ke ne ke nahana hore u batla ho tsamaea.
He was probably older than they thought.	Mohlomong o ne a le moholo ho feta kamoo ba neng ba nahana kateng.
You would have done well to dress like a girl.	U ka be u entse hantle ho apara joaloka ngoanana.
So it was fun.	Kahoo ho ne ho le monate.
And now it happened.	'Me hona joale ho ile ha etsahala.
I will get back to you.	Ke tla khutlela ho uena.
Not everyone can do what you do.	Ha se bohle ba ka etsang seo o se etsang.
You want to ask them.	U batla ho ba botsa.
I have to sleep.	Ke tlameha ho robala.
i will love it.	ke tla e rata.
This is the job he wanted.	Ona ke mosebetsi oo a neng a o batla.
He took a job.	O ile a nka mosebetsi.
There would be times when you might feel guilty.	Ho ne ho tla ba le linako tseo u ka ’nang ua ikutloa u le molato.
I would go with a boy, if it was me.	Ke ne ke tla tsamaea le moshanyana, haeba ho ne ho le ho 'na.
Yet it is very powerful.	Leha ho le joalo e matla haholo.
It was a festive time.	E ne e le nako ya mokete.
But she is very beautiful.	Empa o motle haholo.
For them.	Bakeng sa bona.
However, we still have a long way to go.	Leha ho le joalo, re sa na le tsela e telele eo re lokelang ho e tsamaea.
Dad is not sure what to do to help.	Ntate ha a tsebe hantle hore na a etse eng ho thusa.
He did not want to know.	O ne a sa batle ho tseba.
I don't know how effective this is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na sena se sebetsa hantle hakae.
There was nothing he could say.	Ho ne ho se seo a ka se buang.
It may be early in the morning.	E ka ba esale hoseng.
It's me, you know.	Ke 'na, ua tseba.
It’s also weird.	Hape ke ntho e makatsang.
He looks very good for her.	O shebahala a le motle haholo bakeng sa hae.
I really liked it.	Ke ile ka e rata haholo.
He worked hard, and overcame his problems.	O ne a sebetsa ka thata, mme a hlola mathata a hae.
We are making good money now.	Re etsa chelete e ntle hona joale.
Do whatever you can.	Etsa eng kapa eng eo u ka e khonang.
She was so beautiful.	O ne a le motle haholo.
It was not that he did not love, or love, the man.	E ne e se hore o ne a sa rate, a bile a sa rate monna eo.
Man per day.	Motho ka letsatsi.
You too will see the former, as they are.	Le uena u tla bona tsa khale, kamoo li leng kateng.
You should do it soon.	U lokela ho e etsa haufinyane.
It will be another age.	E tla ba e 'ngoe ea lilemo.
I took off my shoes.	Ke ile ka tsoa lieta.
That is how the police found him.	Ke kamoo mapolesa a ileng a mo fumana kateng.
He can be very good.	A ka ba molemo haholo.
Yes, we know.	Ee, rea tseba.
We had to do that.	Re ile ra tlameha ho etsa joalo.
My mother did what the school did not do.	’Mè o entse seo sekolo se sa kang sa se etsa.
He came out wanting to talk to me but I left.	O ile a tsoa a batla ho bua le ’na empa ka tsamaea.
This is useless.	Sena ha se na thuso.
He clapped his hands.	A mo kopa ka matsoho.
We need you to do that.	Re hloka hore o etse joalo.
He didn't do it.	Ha a ka a e etsa.
He said nothing.	Ha a ka a bua letho.
People simply did not know him.	Batho ba ne ba sa mo tsebe feela.
I never knew him.	Ke ne ke sa mo tsebe le ka mohla.
He does not know more.	Ha a tsebe ho feta.
The rest was very simple.	Tse ling kaofela li ne li le bonolo haholo.
The book looks like any other evening book.	Buka e shebahala joalo ka buka efe kapa efe ea mantsiboea.
I wonder when this will happen.	Kea ipotsa hore na sena se tla etsahala neng.
He knows the law back and forth.	O tseba molao morao le pele.
The place was also nice.	Sebaka le sona se ne se le monate.
I hope you are doing well.	Ke tšepa hore u sebetsa hantle.
They want to eat it alive.	Ba batla ho o ja o phela.
I'm sure that would be fun.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore hoo ho tla ba monate.
The fault lies with me.	Phoso e ne e le ya ka.
It may take some time to resolve this issue.	Ho ka nka nako ho lokisa taba ena.
He said the car was not there before.	A re koloi e ne e le sieo pele.
I did not know.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe.
It could be bad.	E ka bang mpe.
They enter the room.	Ba kena ka phaposing.
He was just a boy.	E ne e le moshanyana feela.
No one wants to hear the truth, but here it is.	Ha ho motho ea batlang ho utloa 'nete, empa ke ena.
The search may have seduced him.	Ho batla ho ka 'na ha mo eka.
He says nothing.	Ha a bue letho.
But most of us do not.	Empa rona ba bangata ha re khone ho etsa joalo.
He could not care less about what anyone thought.	O ne a ka se tsotelle seo mang kapa mang a se nahanang ka eona.
Good way.	Tsela e ntle.
There was nothing that they could do.	Ho ne ho se letho leo ba ka le etsang.
I have never met his mother.	Ha ke eso kopane le mme wa hae.
You can go with me if you like.	U ka tsamaea le 'na ha u rata.
I am very happy with it.	Ke thabile haholo ka eona.
My mother told me about it.	’Mè o ile a mpolella ka eona.
They came to work every morning.	Ba ne ba fihla mosebetsing hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
No one has anything.	Ha ho motho ea nang le letho.
He asked for help.	O ne a kopa thuso.
And to continue.	Le ho tsoela pele.
Go!	Tsamaea!
To help them.	Ho ba thusa.
I did not like it.	Ke ne ke sa rate.
At school.	Sekolong.
It was more beautiful than a person.	E ne e le ntle ho feta ka motho.
Things to come.	Lintho tse tlang.
But he did it, anyhow.	Empa o e entse, leha ho le jwalo.
Whether you have time, is another matter.	Hore na u na le nako, ke ntho e 'ngoe.
The child looked at her with questions.	Ngoana o ile a mo sheba ka lipotso.
If something is working long enough.	Haeba ntho e ntse e sebetsa nako e telele ho lekana.
Because it's as good as.	Hobane e ntle joalo ka.
After that they will come to me.	Ka mor'a moo ba tla tla ho ea ka.
I have no idea what will happen next time this time.	Ha ke nahane hore na ho tla etsahala'ng nakong e tlang nakong ena.
Everyone loved it.	Bohle ba ne ba li rata.
This is exactly my point.	Ena ke eona taba ea ka hantle.
He does not care about my crying.	Ha a tsotelle ho lla ha ka.
I'm not saying do that.	Ha ke re o etse joalo.
Of course he never was.	Ke 'nete hore o ne a e-s'o.
It doesn't look like some of you.	Ha ho bonahale joalo ka ba bang ba hau.
I love it even more this way.	Ke e rata le ho feta ka tsela ena.
What other people think of me is not my business.	Seo batho ba bang ba se nahanang ka 'na hase taba ea ka.
Not good at all.	Ha e ntle ho hang.
He does not need.	Ha a hloke.
It will be me and my girl.	E tla ba 'na le ngoanana oa ka.
He enjoyed being a doctor	O ne a thabela ho ba ngaka
It was very late at night.	E ne e le bosiu haholo.
The same is true of the fourth commandment.	Ho joalo le ka molao oa bone.
I do not want to go back to my place.	Ha ke batle ho khutlela sebakeng sa ka.
I can give up a lot of things.	Ke khona ho tlohela lintho tse ngata.
They certainly had some hard times.	Ka sebele ba ile ba ba le linako tse thata.
Some things were even more important.	Lintho tse ling li ne li le bohlokoa haholoanyane.
I enjoy everything about it.	Ke thabela tsohle ka eona.
I'm still busy.	Ke ntse ke phathahane.
You can't be bigger than this.	U ke ke ua ba moholo ho feta mona.
You are making a mistake.	O etsa phoso.
I have a good job.	Ke na le mosebetsi o motle.
And that's what you're doing now.	Mme ke seo le se etsang hona jwale.
It's in a strange place.	E sebakeng se makatsang.
It was work time.	E ne e le nako ya mosebetsi.
So there are no problems there.	Kahoo ha ho na mathata moo.
It still does.	E ntse e etsa joalo.
You may fall.	U ka oa mohlomong.
They would tell you that, if you asked them.	Ba ne ba tla o bolella seo, ha o ka ba botsa.
Exactly immediately after dinner.	Ha e le hantle hang ka mor'a lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I really can't get enough of it.	Ke hlile ke sitoa ho lekana.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
I decided.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto.
But it is an important fact.	Empa ke ’nete ea bohlokoa.
We have never had such a wonderful day.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra ba le letsatsi le monate hakana.
He looked at her and seemed to want to talk.	O ile a mo sheba mme a bonahala a batla ho bua.
Just painful, and painful.	Le bohloko feela, le bohloko.
You are not a woman.	Ha u mosali.
That may not last long.	Seo se ka 'na sa se ke sa nka nako e telele.
That life was already mine.	Bophelo boo e ne e se e le ba ka.
I am a mother.	Ke mme.
The family thanked everyone.	Lelapa le ile la leboha bohle.
I could not look at them.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ba sheba.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Ha se lekhetlo la pele ho etsa joalo.
The children begin to cry,	Bana ba qala ho lla,
Nothing matters.	Ha ho letho le bohlokoa.
They both left early in the morning.	Ka bobeli ba ile ba tsamaea kapele ka mor'a hoseng.
If we only knew what that thing was we would know.	Hoja re ne re tseba feela hore na ntho eo ke eng re ne re tla tseba.
You were not here.	U ne u le sieo mona.
We are really just friends.	Ruri re metsoalle feela.
There was something we knew about the man's name.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho eo re neng re e tseba ka lebitso la monna eo.
She was beautiful.	O ne a le motle.
His head was very sore.	Hlooho ya hae e ne e le bohloko haholo.
He felt the same way about her.	O ne a ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang ka eena.
And many more, many more.	Le tse ling tse ngata, tse ngata.
He wanted it to be his too.	O ne a batla hore le eona e be ea hae.
This will be fun.	Sena se tla ba monate.
It was great to see you again.	Ho bile monate ho u bona hape.
You could even say something.	U ka ba ua bua ho hong.
Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh!	Bua ka monate.
If it was bad enough he could always drink.	Haeba e ne e le mpe ka ho lekaneng o ne a ka noa kamehla.
He should return after a few days.	O lokela ho khutla ka mor'a matsatsi a 'maloa.
I'm waiting to see what comes next.	Ke emetse ho bona se tlang.
Now live !.	Joale phela!.
I play well.	Ke bapala hantle.
He drank from it before speaking again.	O ile a noa ho eona pele a bua hape.
I was able to fix the problem.	Ke ile ka khona ho lokisa bothata.
He would just go and look.	O ne a tla ea feela ho ea sheba.
But people buy it.	Empa batho ba e reka.
I soon realized how difficult this was.	Kapele ke ile ka hlokomela kamoo sena se neng se le boima kateng.
Many.	Ba bangata.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore e ka ’na eaba ha ho joalo.
That is why we are here.	Ke ka hona re leng mona.
That was his working life.	Eo e ne e le bophelo ba hae ba mosebetsi.
Good girl!	Ngoanana ea molemo!
I like to help.	Ke rata ho thusa.
They have the best.	Ba na le tse molemo ka ho fetisisa.
That's what you do.	Ke seo u se etsang.
This is something new to me.	Ena ke ntho e ncha ho 'na.
I really find it fun.	Ruri ke bona e le monate.
I did not return.	Ha kea ka ka khutla.
Something is happening.	Ho na le ntho e etsahalang.
We pay him.	Rea mo lefa.
It's really fun.	E hlile e monate.
Before you do anything, you must read this.	Pele o etsa eng kapa eng, o tlameha ho bala sena.
But he had to comment.	Empa o ne a tlameha ho fana ka maikutlo.
My roommate did just that.	Motho eo ke neng ke lula le eena o ile a etsa joalo.
He would have thought we could never know.	A ka be a ntse a nahana hore re ke ke ra tseba.
The job is for the woman.	Mosebetsi ke oa mosali.
, the latter.	, ea bobeli.
It was passing.	E ne e feta.
They have been living here for years.	E se e le lilemo ba lula mona.
I was able to catch it.	Ke ile ka khona ho e tšoara.
This he could be sure of.	Sena o ne a ka ba le bonnete ba sona.
She may have loved her husband, but she really needed him.	E ka ’na eaba o ne a rata monna oa hae, empa o ne a hlile a mo hloka.
He read the letter again.	O ile a bala lengolo hape.
Maybe, after a few years, there would have been a way.	Mohlomong, ka mor'a lilemo tse 'maloa, ho ka be ho bile le tsela.
I did not eat today.	Ha kea ja kajeno.
There is no one else here.	Ha ho motho e mong mona.
Of course, they rejected him.	Ehlile, ba ile ba mo hana.
Mary sang beautifully.	Maria o ile a bina ha monate.
Be careful!	Hlokomela!
It would not work if we tried.	E ne e ke ke ea sebetsa leha re ka leka.
If you were not.	Haeba u ne u se joalo.
It may take until tomorrow.	E ka nka ho fihlela hosane.
I have never done anything before.	Ha ke so ka ke etsa letho pele.
He never spoke to me.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua le nna.
He was busy with other things, but it just so happened.	O ne a phathahane ka lintho tse ling, empa ho ile ha etsahala joalo.
There is no such thing.	Haho ntho e joalo.
I drove home.	Ke ile ka khanna hae.
I can go now.	Nka tsamaea hona joale.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
He realized that at once.	A hlokomela seo hang.
He thought it was coming from the future.	O ne a nahana hore e tsoa nakong e tlang.
It often looks like nothing.	Hangata e shebahala e se letho.
I want to fix things.	Ke batla ho lokisa litaba.
Both are very high levels.	Ka bobeli ke boemo bo phahameng haholo.
Although getting there will not be easy.	Le hoja ho fihla moo ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
But please, be careful.	Empa ka kopo, hlokomela.
I think that's me.	Ke nahana hore ke 'na eo.
The children are healthy.	Bana ba phela hantle.
We saw you coming.	Re u bone u fihla.
They are real things.	Ke lintho tsa sebele.
So he did that.	Kahoo a etsa seo.
However, it was necessary.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho hlokahala.
I would be the last person to stay.	Ke ne ke tla ba motho oa ho qetela oa ho lula.
And he wanted to do something.	Mme o ne a batla ho etsa ho hong.
His job is his life.	Mosebetsi oa hae ke bophelo ba hae.
I couldn’t in the past.	Ke ne ke sa khone nakong e fetileng.
They saw something.	Ba ne ba bona ho hong.
But that did not help.	Empa hoo ha hoa ka ha thusa letho.
I thought about what to do.	Ke ile ka nahana hore na ke etse eng.
You have to do it.	O lokela ho e etsa.
Finding something you think is good.	Ho fumana ntho eo u nahanang hore e ntle.
But we will never know.	Empa re ke ke ra tseba.
This must be wrong!	E tlameha ebe hona ke phoso!
Amazing.	E makatsang.
That would have been easy.	Seo se ka be se bile bonolo.
So here are the front and back.	Kahoo ke tsena pele le ka morao.
He was tomorrow.	O ne a le hosane.
It wasn't you.	E ne e se uena.
I should have said yes.	Ke ne ke lokela hore ebe ke re e.
You have to look for his room.	U tlameha ho batla kamore ea hae.
For her, she must help.	Bakeng sa hae, o tlameha ho thusa.
It was late in the afternoon.	E ne e se e le mantsiboea.
And yet we love them very much.	Mme leha ho le jwalo re ba rata haholo.
The child cannot stand.	Ngoana ha a khone ho ema.
And that should be enough.	Mme hoo ho lokela ho lekana.
This is my favorite time of the day.	Ena ke nako eo ke e ratang haholo ea letsatsi.
Which, of course, comes to mind.	E leng hore, ho tla ho nahana ka eona, ho joalo.
The only question is 'when'.	Potso feela ke 'neng'.
All the time.	Ka linako tsohle.
I thought they did.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ba entse joalo.
Yet he does not see.	Leha ho le joalo ha a bone.
It's too long.	E telele haholo.
The people there are real.	Batho ba teng ke ba sebele.
He did well.	O entse hantle.
Start with yourself.	Qala ka uena.
As it is today.	Joalo ka kajeno.
We do not want to see it happen again.	Ha re batle ho e bona e etsahala hape.
He enjoyed reading all kinds of books.	O ne a thabela ho bala libuka tsohle tsa mofuta oo.
Maybe he was just tired.	Mohlomong o ne a khathetse feela.
We keep things simple.	Re boloka lintho li le bonolo.
We finished our work ahead of time today.	Re qetile mosebetsi oa rona pele ho nako kajeno.
He could not spend the day alone.	O ne a ke ke a qeta letsatsi a le mong.
After that, he would have to see.	Ka mor'a moo, o ne a tla tlameha ho bona.
It's hard to see.	Ho thata ho bona.
That’s what we have to do though.	Ke seo re lokelang ho se etsa leha ho le joalo.
Your job, my husband.	Mosebetsi oa hau, monna oa ka.
Talking to you.	Ho bua le uena.
Be amazing and important.	E-ba ea makatsang le ea bohlokoa.
I think that's a bad thing.	Ke nahana hore ke taba e mpe.
Opportunity is something else in the future.	Monyetla ke ntho e 'ngoe hape nakong e tlang.
To be like that.	Ho ba joalo ka.
Then many can imagine it or see it in a picture.	Joale ba bangata ba ka e nahana kapa ba e bona ka setšoantšo.
At times, nothing happened.	Ka linako tse ling, ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala.
He did not continue.	Ha aa ka a tsoela pele.
I let him take the car.	Ke ile ka mo lumella ho nka koloi.
I ask questions.	Ke botsa lipotso.
Try to help my team, try to do my job.	Leka ho thusa sehlopha sa ka, leka ho etsa mosebetsi oa ka.
I never wanted it, you know.	Ha ke eso o batle, ua tseba.
They believe it was an accident.	Ba lumela hore e bile kotsi.
Use what you think will work best.	Sebelisa seo u nahanang hore se tla sebetsa hantle.
You have to move on with your life.	U tlameha ho tsoela pele ka bophelo ba hau.
It looked good.	Ho ile ha bonahala hantle.
He did not know that.	O ne a sa tsebe seo.
From a nearby place.	Ho tloha sebakeng se haufi.
And the reason is clear.	Mme lebaka le hlakile.
So we will never know.	Kahoo re ke ke ra tseba.
They said he was hurt.	Ba itse o utloile bohloko.
He wants to live with a beautiful girl.	O batla ho lula le ngoanana e motle.
che.	che.
But it's bad.	Empa ke mpe.
And you certainly do not think so.	'Me ka sebele ha u nahane.
I really made you.	Ke hlile ke u entse.
They are in real time.	Ba nakong ea sebele.
It does not have enough energy.	Ha e na matla a lekaneng.
They will not let me go.	Li ke ke tsa etsa hore ke tsamaee.
He believes this is necessary.	O lumela hore sena sea hlokahala.
Each other.	E mong le e mong.
There was no reason to doubt.	Ho ne ho se na lebaka la ho belaela.
This is a beautiful house.	Ena ke ntlo e ntle.
It will not pass through its current form.	E ke ke ea feta ka mokhoa oa eona oa hona joale.
The group has a name.	Sehlopha se na le lebitso.
He knows what he can do.	O tseba seo a ka se etsang.
They will not learn.	Ba ke ke ba ithuta.
She wept when her parents died.	O ile a lla ha batsoali ba hae ba hlokahala.
They do not speak.	Ha ba bue.
We do not have to worry about them.	Ha rea ​​tlameha ho ba hlokomela.
Yes, he has a wife.	E, o na le mosali.
But soon they return.	Empa kapele ba khutla hape.
We will meet tomorrow.	Re tla kopana hosane.
What he was seeing now was just him.	Seo a neng a se bona joale ke eena feela.
And one of the strongest.	Le e 'ngoe ea tse matla ka ho fetisisa.
That's my problem.	Ke bothata ba ka.
No, you don't think so.	Che, ha u nahane.
But this requires something.	Empa sena se hloka ho hong.
He could do everything.	O ne a ka etsa tsohle.
They say something.	Ba bua ho hong.
They leave without saying a word.	Ba tsamaea ba sa bua letho.
The group told him they did not like his idea.	Sehlopha se ile sa mo bolella hore ha se rate mohopolo oa hae.
We start with the simple ones.	Re qala ka tse bonolo.
At night it swims.	Bosiu e ea sesa.
But enough style.	Empa mokhoa o lekaneng.
Thanks for watching.	Ke leboha ho shebella.
I have the same issue exactly.	Ke na le taba e tšoanang hantle.
You will have to ask him.	U tla tlameha ho mo botsa.
We'll wait a minute.	Re tla ema hanyane.
We both have to keep it together.	Ka bobeli re tlameha ho e boloka hammoho.
Some may simply not see it happening.	Ba bang ba ka mpa ba se ke ba e bona e etsahala.
And do not be a child.	'Me u se ke ua ba ngoana.
You have to write it down.	U lokela ho e ngola.
That team is great.	Sehlopha seo se setle.
The sun begins to return.	Letsatsi le qala ho khutla.
The family goes on with their lives.	Lelapa le tsoela pele ka bophelo ba lona.
It was something about the way they were together.	E ne e le ho hong ka tsela eo ba neng ba le hammoho ka eona.
Something better without my opinion.	Ntho e betere ntle le maikutlo a ka.
One can take it.	E mong a ka e nka.
He passed.	O ile a feta.
This is very important.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo.
He did it better than anyone else.	O e entse hantle ho feta mang kapa mang.
There is no better time than now.	Ha ho nako e betere ho feta hona joale.
He went out until late at night.	O ile a tsoa ho fihlela bosiu.
He no longer needs it.	Ha a sa o hloka.
He was out of place.	O ne a se sebakeng.
Several years.	Lilemo tse 'maloa.
However, I kept going.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ile ka tsoela pele.
Like children, they trust.	Joaloka bana, baa tšepa.
Mother and family and friends were present.	’Mè le lelapa le metsoalle ba ne ba le teng.
It took him three hours to get home from there.	Ho ile ha mo nka lihora tse tharo ho ea hae ho tloha moo.
We were not close.	Re ne re se haufi.
We did not talk for long.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bua nako e telele.
He lives next to me.	O lula haufi le nna.
I don't care now.	Ha ke na taba jwale.
Then another group arrives.	Joale sehlopha se seng sea fihla.
It is not enough to.	Ha hoa lekana ho .
It did not fall.	Ha ea ka ea oa.
Eaba,	Eaba,
I was three years old.	Ke ne ke le lilemo li tharo.
It works well.	E sebetsa hantle.
This usually happens over the years.	Hangata sena se etsahala nakong ea lilemo.
It was clear why.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore na ke hobane'ng.
You were playing with your father.	U ne u ntse u bapala le ntate oa hau.
We have to do things right.	Re tlameha ho etsa lintho hantle.
To provide a better life.	Ho fana ka bophelo bo betere.
The only bad thing was that he didn't speak.	Ntho e mpe feela e ne e le hore o ne a sa bue.
We are not the police here.	Ha re mapolesa mona.
It can make you do things that you thought you would never do.	E ka etsa hore u etse lintho tseo u neng u nahana hore u ke ke ua li etsa.
This book is hard to read.	Buka ena e bala ka thata.
And he certainly did.	'Me ka sebele o ile a etsa joalo.
They had not yet found him.	Ba ne ba ntse ba eso mo fumane.
That was the case now.	Ho ne ho le joalo hona joale.
That would not be easy.	Hoo ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
Work to do.	Mosebetsi oa ho etsa.
I know we are friends.	Kea tseba hore re metsoalle.
That was not the case in his day.	Ho ne ho se joalo ka nako ea hae.
But, chance or not, it does not matter.	Empa, monyetla kapa che, ha ho na taba.
Do not go begging him.	U se ke ua ea mo kopa.
The same is true for parents.	Ho joalo le ka batsoali.
He can't tell me.	A ke ke a mpolella.
Let's just go.	Re mpe re tsamaee.
Because there is something wrong.	Hobane ho na le ntho e mpe.
However, there is nothing wrong with that.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho letho le phoso ntle le seo.
I had it.	Ke bile le eona.
I did not understand why.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise lebaka la eona.
I thought a lot about him.	Ke ne ke nahana ka eena haholo.
He was making sure.	O ne a etsa bonnete.
We were there for a few hours.	Re ile ra ba moo ka lihora tse seng kae.
That is not a problem.	Seo ha se bothata.
Another type of.	Mofuta o mong oa.
I know the baby is going to be a baby.	Kea tseba hore ngoana e tla ba ngoana.
However, it is not very difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho thata haholo.
And we both knew why.	'Me ka bobeli re ne re tseba lebaka.
For his people.	Bakeng sa batho ba hae.
I thought we were happy together.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re thabile hammoho.
I'm not sure about that.	Ha ke na bonnete ka taba eo.
They didn't need much more.	Ba ne ba sa hloke tse ling tse ngata.
He spent the evening reading.	O ile a qeta mantsiboea a ntse a bala.
We have to go home.	Re tlameha ho ea hae.
It looked fun.	E ne e bonahala e le monate.
I wanted what you had.	Ke ne ke batla seo o nang le sona.
They work hard for their money.	Ba sebetsa ka thata bakeng sa chelete ea bona.
I can't understand it very well.	Ha ke khone ho e utloisisa hantle.
Good things.	Lintho tse molemo.
The phone rings.	Mohala oa lla.
No woman will read it.	Ha ho mosali ea tla e bala.
The boy did not sleep.	Moshanyana ha aa ka a robala.
He did not ask what happened to him.	Ha aa ka a botsa hore na ho etsahetse'ng ka eena.
She loved her son.	O ne a rata mora oa hae.
I'd like to talk to you about your wife.	Ke kopa ho bua le uena ka mosali oa hau.
The local people are very familiar with these matters.	Batho ba moo ba tseba litaba tsena haholo.
It really works.	E hlile ea sebetsa.
He started out guilty.	O ile a qala a le molato.
No one really knows where my father is.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle hore na ntate o hokae.
They saw the danger.	Ba ile ba bona kotsi.
I'll take the car, meet you soon.	Ke tla nka koloi, ke kopane le uena ka pele.
Getting close to it should be easy.	Ho ba haufi le eona ho lokela ho ba bonolo.
I don't need you.	ha ke o hloke.
Every time it starts.	Nako le nako ha e qala.
You have never met him.	Ha u so ka ua kopana le eena.
We had time then.	Re ne re e-na le nako ka nako eo.
You probably know a few.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe u tseba tse seng kae.
Write from there.	Ngola ho tloha moo.
But those things are a fact of life.	Empa lintho tseo ke taba ea 'nete.
It certainly is so often.	Ka sebele ho joalo hangata.
And then school.	Mme ebe sekolo.
Most people do not understand what has happened to you.	Batho ba bangata ha ba utloisise hore na ho etsahetse'ng ka uena.
I know he was starting to think a lot about children.	Kea tseba hore o ne a qala ho nahana haholo ka bana.
Please, picture.	Ka kopo, setšoantšo.
I felt good.	Ke ne ke ikutloa hantle.
Again, just like that.	Hape, feela joalo.
Everyone loves children.	E mong le e mong o rata bana.
Some may be in the past or in the present.	Tse ling e ka 'na eaba ke tsa nakong e fetileng kapa tsa hona joale.
We are here, and they need us.	Re teng, mme ba a re hloka.
There is no way.	Haho tsela.
They helped the needy.	Ba ne ba thusa ba hlokang.
However, that did not mean that he could not accept the truth.	Leha ho le joalo, hase hore o ne a ka lumela 'nete.
And it goes beyond that.	Mme e feta moo.
Except for the past.	Ntle le tse fetileng.
Or mother.	Kapa mme.
But the boy refused.	Empa moshanyana eo o ile a hana.
So nice to have a hand in this for me.	Kahoo ho monate ho na le thuso ho sena bakeng sa ka.
And in this way.	Le ka tsela ena.
Of course the police came and took him away.	Ehlile mapolesa a ile a tla a mo nka.
I found it easy to walk.	Ke ile ka fumana ho le bonolo ho tsamaea.
This request is not valid.	Kopo ena ha e ntle.
So he decided to stay.	Kahoo, o ile a etsa qeto ea ho se tsamaee.
There wouldn't be much of that, either.	Ho ka be ho sa tlo ba le tse ngata tsa tseo, le hona.
You can donate books to school.	U ka fana ka libuka sekolong.
If they need help, they will probably say so there.	Haeba ba hloka thuso, mohlomong ba tla bua joalo moo.
We will need this.	Re tla hloka sena.
So you use it during the search.	Kahoo u e sebelisa nakong ea ho batla.
No, there is no such thing.	Che, ha ho letho le joalo.
That child will be nothing.	Ngoana eo a ke ke a ba letho.
I really started to like the place.	Ke hlile ke qala ho rata sebaka seo.
And many of them do not.	Mme ba bangata ba bona ha ba etse jwalo.
Some of it has been or is in it now.	Ba bang ba lona ba bile teng kapa ba ho eona hona joale.
Great job for him.	Mosebetsi o moholo ho eena.
You can enjoy this.	U ka thabela sena.
Do not keep talking.	O se ke wa dula o bua.
Not even one.	Leha e le a le mong.
The doctor refused.	Ngaka e ile ea hana.
He loved to drive at night.	O ne a rata ho khanna bosiu.
However, I am not sure.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke na bonnete.
This should be enough to last us all week.	Sena se lokela ho lekana ho re qeta beke kaofela.
We conclude that he does.	Re etsa qeto ea hore o etsa joalo.
Which is a lot.	E leng ngata.
There is always something he can do.	Kamehla ho na le ntho eo e ka e etsang.
He was a good boy.	E ne e le moshanyana e motle.
But that person could not be me.	Empa motho eo e ne e ke ke ea e-ba 'na.
Just knowing this is not enough.	Ho tseba sena feela ha hoa lekana.
He doesn't get it.	Ha a e fumane.
I'm done now.	Ke qetile jwale.
The same is true of touch.	Ho joalo le ka ho tšoara.
He wished it were not so late.	O ne a lakatsa eka e se be morao hakaalo.
But other than that, it's very simple.	Empa ntle le moo, ho bonolo haholo.
It was not necessary, you know.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale, ua tseba.
Anyone could enter.	Mang kapa mang o ne a ka kena.
But we could not.	Empa ha rea ​​khona.
The task is not easy.	Mosebetsi ha o bonolo.
She told her son.	A bolella mora wa hae.
Mine is not there.	Ea ka ha e eo.
The more you learn, the more you need to learn.	Ha u ntse u ithuta haholoanyane, u hloka ho ithuta haholoanyane.
And often, they are able to be both at the same time.	'Me hangata, ba khona ho ba bobeli ka nako e le' ngoe.
And your family.	Le lelapa la hao.
He was hurt.	O ne a utloile bohloko.
However, since then, he has remained.	Leha ho le joalo, ho tloha ka nako eo, o ntse a lula.
We have so many things.	Re na le lintho tse ngata haholo.
It only needs to take three hours.	E hloka ho nka lihora tse tharo feela.
Sometimes people just don't want to hear it.	Ka linako tse ling, batho ha ba batle ho li utloa.
Help is available.	Thuso e teng.
However, they did not say that they would be all right.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ba re ba tla ba hantle joalo.
Yes, they are.	E, ba joalo.
But that he did not know if anyone had gone with him.	Empa hore o ne a sa tsebe hore na ho na le motho ea ileng a tsamaea le eena.
It's as simple as that.	Ho bonolo joalo ka seo.
I never wanted to see them again.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho ba bona hape.
In their work.	Mosebetsing oa bona.
In fact, they should do so.	Ha e le hantle, ba lokela ho etsa joalo.
I think we have problems.	Ke nahana hore re na le mathata.
There is nothing wrong with a little sleep.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka ho robala hanyane.
All of this works well.	Sena sohle se sebetsa hantle.
That is what happened today.	Ke sona se etsahetseng kajeno.
He loved her.	O ne a mo rata.
You will have to find a way to get there.	U tla tlameha ho fumana mokhoa oa ho fihla moo.
He said it is very important.	O itse e bohlokoa haholo.
He had a headache.	O ne a tšoeroe ke hlooho.
He took it.	O ile a e nka.
But that was hard.	Empa hoo ho ne ho le thata.
Many live by that.	Ba bangata ba phela ka seo.
I wrote another thought.	Ke ile ka ngola mohopolo o mong hape.
I did not go through with it.	Ha kea ka ka feta le eona.
So be mindful of talking out your feelings.	Kahoo hlokomela kamoo u buang le uena kateng.
We see it leave again.	Re e bona e tloha hape.
That's the way they talk about it.	Ke kamoo ba buang ka eona.
We had to find a way.	Re ile ra tlameha ho fumana tsela.
And some were not.	Mme ba bang ba ne ba se jwalo.
I always talk.	Ke bua kamehla.
He lives nearby.	O lula haufi.
None of us could help watching it now.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea neng a ka thusa ho shebella hona joale.
I have never had this problem and it is amazing.	Ha ke so ka ka ba le bothata bona mme ke ntho e makatsang.
We can look at something beautiful.	Re ka shebella ntho e ntle.
But it was not good.	Mme e ne e se ntle.
Either way.	Ka mokhoa o mong kapa o mong.
Just really hard.	Hantle feela ka thata.
Do not be so hard on him.	U se ke ua ba thata hakaalo ho eena.
Thanks for your feedback !.	Ke leboha maikutlo a hau!.
But thanks to us, today they are hard to find.	Empa ka lebaka la rona, kajeno li thata ho li fumana.
You may have heard about me.	E ka 'na eaba le uena u utloile ka 'na.
He felt guilty.	O ile a ikutloa a le molato.
It is not my job to take care of everything.	Ha se mosebetsi oa ka ho hlokomela tsohle.
I don’t think he comes out too much.	Ha ke nahane hore o tsoa haholo.
I need to talk to you.	Ke hloka ho bua le uena.
She cried.	O ile a lla.
That's the kind of situation.	Ke boemo ba mofuta oo.
This is a true production.	Ena ke tlhahiso ea 'nete.
I had never heard anything like this before.	Ke ne ke qala ho utloa ntho e kang ena.
But they are fun to watch.	Empa li monate ho li shebella.
What is that? 	Ke eng hoo?
But, simply, it did not work.	Empa, feela, ha ea ka ea sebetsa.
I know you better than that.	Ke o tseba ho feta moo.
It'll be a chance to meet, something like that.	E tla ba monyetla oa ho kopana, ntho ea mofuta oo.
You would not know.	O ka be o sa tsebe.
I wanted to do it again.	Ke ne ke batla ho e etsa hape.
Now if you can come this way.	Jwale ha o ka tla ka tsela ena.
It did not work for one of us.	Ha ea ka ea sebetsa ho e mong oa rona.
He did not need it.	O ne a sa e hloke.
We need to buy more food.	Re lokela ho reka lijo tse ngata.
He finally found something he knew very well.	Qetellong o ile a fumana ntho eo a neng a e tseba hantle.
But with this.	Empa ka sena.
If at that time and.	Haeba ka nako eo le.
Yes.	E ile.
They were absent.	Ba ne ba le sieo.
You were really good.	O ne o le molemo ruri.
It is nothing more than the state of the last image.	Ha se letho ho feta boemo ba setšoantšo sa ho qetela.
It's just a fun place.	Ke sebaka se monate feela.
Of course he could pass.	Ehlile o ne a ka feta.
I don't care what others think of me.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na ba bang ba nahana eng ka 'na.
That, of course, was not real life.	Ho hlakile hore boo e ne e se bophelo ba sebele.
Moreover, they look very nice.	Ho feta moo, li shebahala li le ntle haholo.
if any.	haeba e le efe.
Who will do it first?	Ke mang ea tla e etsa pele?
Something very good can be bad.	Ntho e ntle haholo e ka ba mpe.
And out of it.	Le ka ntle ho eona.
Think about it.	Nahana ka eona.
I mean, really.	Ke bolela, ka 'nete.
They just see things.	Ba mpa ba bona lintho feela.
Not everyone has those things.	Hase bohle ba nang le lintho tseo.
Everyone would love to be in your place.	Bohle ba ka rata ho ba sebakeng sa hau.
Now, he was an individual.	Jwale, e ne e le motho ka mong.
Or not.	Kapa ha ho joalo.
I think we need more than that.	Ke nahana hore re hloka ho feta moo.
He just knew it was there.	O ne a tseba feela hore e teng.
I have to ask you something.	Ke tlameha ho o botsa ho hong.
There is something strange about it.	Ho na le ntho e makatsang ka eona.
We did family chores.	Re ne re etsa lintho tsa lelapa.
Now was the real time.	Joale e ne e le nako ea 'nete.
And there he was.	Mme ke eo moo a neng a le teng.
That's all it is.	Ke seo e leng sona feela.
That is, it was not that kind of thing.	Ke hore e ne e se ntho ea mofuta oo.
Don't tell me.	U se ke ua bolela 'na.
They live in us.	Ba phela ka ho rona.
I played with it and loved it.	Ke ne ke bapala ka eona mme ke e rata.
Now, we'll stop that.	Joale, re tla tlohela seo.
One day we will pay for this.	Ka letsatsi le leng re tla lefa bakeng sa sena.
I never did, well, never.	Ha ke so etse joalo, hantle, le ka mohla.
Maybe a week later.	Mohlomong ka mor'a beke.
They are very good.	Ba hantle haholo.
Well, it's easy.	Hantle, ho bonolo.
A long time ago.	Khale khale.
But it was difficult.	Empa ho ne ho le thata.
It was hard to see the good way.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bona tsela e ntle.
Tonight, it was a good night to say a little.	Bosiung bona, e bile bosiu bo monate ho bua hanyane.
You need to make sure they understand what you want.	U lokela ho etsa hore ba utloisise seo u se batlang.
Her father too.	Ntate oa hae hape.
I saw you come in.	Ke u bone u kena.
We do not know enough.	Ha re tsebe ho lekana.
There was nothing there.	Ho ne ho se letho moo.
The player does that.	Sebapali se etsa joalo.
The years passed.	Lilemo li ile tsa feta.
I go to work every day.	Ke ea mosebetsing letsatsi le letsatsi.
There was nothing else he could do.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng leo a ka le etsang.
It was good in the end.	E ne e le molemo qetellong.
We have to fix things.	Re tlameha ho lokisa lintho.
It only takes time, and once it works, it works.	Ho nka nako feela, ebe hang ha e sebetsa, ea sebetsa.
I can no longer say.	Ha ke sa khona ho bolela.
It just knows.	E tseba feela.
That is a real problem.	Ke bothata ba sebele.
Try as hard as he could, he never slept.	Leka ka moo a neng a ka leka kateng, ha a ka a robala.
It happens.	E ea etsahala.
But he thought it was good.	Empa o ne a nahana hore e ntle.
Some of us.	Ba bang ba rona.
Opening, he thought.	Ho bula, a nahana.
They want to find him.	Ba batla ho mo batla.
That was the way one would have to do it.	Eo e ne e le tsela eo motho a neng a tla lokela ho e etsa.
When we saw that, we thought he had something.	Ha re bona seo, ra nahana hore o na le ho hong.
We do not want to think negatively.	Ha re batle ho nahana tse mpe.
It is sometimes.	Ke ka linako tse ling.
Very easy to use.	Ho bonolo haholo ho e sebelisa.
He had found his place.	O ne a fumane sebaka sa hae.
But he is there.	Empa o teng.
He leaves in the morning.	O tloha hoseng.
So do I.	Le 'na ke joalo.
I have my own car.	Ke na le koloi ea ka.
It can be a fun phone to watch for real.	E ka ba mohala o monate ho o shebella ka 'nete.
Be very, very careful.	Hlokomela haholo, haholo.
He did not exist for long.	Ha a ka a ba teng nako e telele.
Well, to each of his.	Hantle, ho e mong le e mong oa hae.
This is where the work lies.	Ke hona moo mosebetsi o leng teng.
You may not care.	E ka 'na eaba ha u tsotelle.
Tell them anything.	Ba bolelle eng kapa eng.
Any forget about these ever happened.	Lebala leha e le efe ea tsena e kile ea etsahala.
I had nice clothes, but not many.	Ke ne ke e-na le liaparo tse ntle, empa e se tse ngata.
What was more, they knew nothing.	Se neng se feta moo, ba ne ba sa tsebe letho.
And probably no one should tell you what to think.	'Me mohlomong ha ho motho ea lokelang ho u bolella seo u lokelang ho se nahana.
It doesn't know a person.	Ha e tsebe motho.
But that was no longer the case.	Empa ho ne ho se ho se joalo.
Thank you so much for the thought.	Ke leboha haholo ka mohopolo.
He told me to sit down.	O ile a re ke lule fatše.
When his time came.	Ha nako ya hae e fihla.
Then you decide to walk around the old school.	Ebe u etsa qeto ea ho tsamaea ka maoto haufi le sekolo sa khale.
It can do everything right.	E ka etsa ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe hantle.
Return to the party.	Khutlela moketeng.
It was so.	Ho ne ho le joalo.
We can give you the best time of your life.	Re ka u fa nako e monate ea bophelo ba hau.
Without water we cannot survive long.	Ntle le metsi re ke ke ra phela nako e telele.
I don't know who it might be.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e ka ba mang.
The issue is really difficult.	Taba e thata ruri.
We will leave him without question.	Re tla mo tlohela ka ntle ho potso.
I want to buy everything.	Ke batla ho reka ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
There is a better alternative.	Ho na le mokhoa o mong o betere.
People talk about them.	Batho ba bua ka tsona.
I was not a real person to him.	Ke ne ke se motho oa sebele ho eena.
Certainly not one.	Ka sebele ha ho a le mong.
He had nothing of this.	O ne a sena letho la sena.
I did not need to know more than that.	Ke ne ke sa hloke ho tseba ho feta moo.
The second one works well.	Lekhetlo la bobeli e sebetsa hantle.
Things other than children.	Lintho tse ling ntle le bana.
He needs a job.	O hloka mosebetsi.
One man has a problem, another does not.	Monna e mong o na le bothata, e mong ha a na.
I thought it might be difficult, but it was not.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho ka ba thata, empa ho ne ho se joalo.
He wanted to buy his old house.	O ne a batla ho reka ntlo ea hae ea khale.
That makes it even better.	Seo se etsa hore e be betere le ho feta.
Write as you speak and people will want to read your work.	Ngola joalo ka ha u bua 'me batho ba tla batla ho bala mosebetsi oa hau.
He did not know how he did it.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na o entse seo joang.
And so it was.	Mme ho ne ho le jwalo.
We never thought of that.	Re ne re sa nahane ka seo.
Sometimes it does not.	Ka linako tse ling ha e etse joalo.
I will sleep on the floor in your room.	Ke tla robala fatše ka kamoreng ea hau.
However, these could not enter.	Leha ho le joalo, tsena a sitoa ho kena.
I don't know what you're talking about!	Ha ke tsebe hore na u bua ka eng!
So, maybe we're just moving on.	Ka hona, mohlomong re ntse re tsoela pele.
Probably never, of course.	Mohlomong ha ho mohla, ha e le hantle.
He couldn't tell me a bit.	O ne a ke ke a mpolella hanyane.
You are no longer here.	Ha u sa le teng.
I'll come tonight.	Ke tla tla bosiung bona.
I have no news.	Ha ke na litaba.
It is useless at all.	Ha e na thuso ho hang.
Keep things silly.	Boloka lintho tse hlokang kelello.
She couldn't see her hair.	O ne a sa bone moriri oa hae.
I don't need anyone.	Ha ke hloke motho.
It will work for me then.	E ea sebetsa ho 'na ka nako eo.
I can come in here.	Nka kena mona.
My mother refused to believe that.	’Mè o ile a hana ho lumela seo.
But one day it started.	Empa ka letsatsi le leng e ile ea qala.
When people do what they like, you can know.	Ha batho ba etsa seo ba se ratang, u ka tseba.
Several people claim to have seen it.	Batho ba ’maloa ba bolela hore ba e bone.
Think about that.	Nahana ka seo.
I am sure it will be there.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore e tla ba teng.
By all means.	Ka tsela tsohle.
I went with it and it worked very well.	Ke ile ka tsamaea le eona 'me ea sebetsa hantle haholo.
It was a painful time.	E ne e le nako e bohloko.
We thought there was an accident.	Re ne re nahana hore ho bile le kotsi.
But you will.	Empa u tla etsa joalo.
They were happy now.	Ba ne ba thabetse hona joale.
It looks really fun.	E shebahala e le monate haholo.
He talks a lot.	O bua haholo.
It's been too long.	E se e le nako e telele haholo.
I think he is well.	Ke nahana hore o teng hantle.
Thank you so much for your help.	Ke leboha thuso ea hau haholo.
He certainly was forgetting something important.	Ka sebele o ne a lebala ntho ea bohlokoa.
It was fun from it all.	Ho ne ho le monate ho tloha ho tsohle.
I even called him to see if he would take it.	Ke ile ka ba ka mo letsetsa ho bona hore na o tla nka.
The law will not tell you that.	Molao ha o tlo o bolella seo.
The place could not be better.	Sebaka se ka se be betere.
This will not stand.	Sena se ke ke sa ema.
It was time for his first team.	E ne e le nako ea sehlopha sa hae sa pele.
There is no power nearby.	Ha ho na matla a haufi.
Let you know this.	Etsa hore u tsebe sena.
I loved her like everyone else.	Ke ne ke mo rata joalo ka ba bang kaofela.
You have children.	U na le bana.
Many people have her opinion about him.	Batho ba bangata ba na le maikutlo a hae ka eena.
Tell people what is happening.	Bolella batho ka se etsahalang.
They really thought they could be.	Ba ne ba hlile ba nahana hore ba ka ba joalo.
However, he did not seem to care.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho bonahala a sa tsotelle.
He doesn't like the time.	Ha a rate nako eo.
For both of us.	Ho rona bobeli.
He handed her a letter.	O ile a mo fa lengolo.
No, that may not be the case.	Che, hoo e ka 'na ea e-ba taba eo.
Which is just fine.	E leng hantle feela.
So live very much.	Kahoo phela haholo.
But this obviously did not work.	Empa ho hlakile hore sena ha sea ka sa sebetsa.
Keep this in place when you work.	Boloka sena se le teng ha u sebetsa.
Or so we thought.	Kapa re ne re nahana joalo.
He left quickly.	O ile a tsamaea kapele.
I don’t know if it is good or bad.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e ntle kapa e mpe.
No problem.	Ha ho bothata.
Something very dangerous.	Ntho e kotsi haholo.
And that gives us a chance to spend more time together.	Le ho re fa monyetla oa ho ba le nako e ngata hammoho.
At a time like this, too.	Ka nako e kang ena, hape.
You need to tell me what's going on here.	U hloka ho mpolella hore na ho etsahalang mona.
I had just started.	Ke ne ke sa tsoa qala.
And he just refused to eat.	Mme a hana ho ja feela.
Even more they did not care.	Le ho feta ba ne ba sa tsotelle.
Maybe you should.	Mohlomong o lokela.
It's a very good thing for them.	Ke ntho e ntle haholo ho bona.
I played it hard and hard.	Ke ile ka e bapala ka thata le ka thata.
I mean.	Ke bolela nna.
All of these things can be true at the same time.	Lintho tsena kaofela e ka ba ’nete ka nako e le ’ngoe.
I didn't even know he was here.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe le hore o teng mona.
We lived in it before.	Re ne re lula ho eona pele.
It is better to watch.	Ho molemo ha u ka shebella.
I stood nearby.	Ke ile ka ema haufi.
It has been very difficult to be here.	Ho bile thata haholo ho ba mona.
We have enough of that.	Re na le tse lekaneng tsa tseo.
Giving you all we can.	Ho o fa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
It's just a place to sleep.	Ke sebaka sa ho robala feela.
I wanted something like this.	Ke ne ke batla ntho e kang ena.
But he still had to be the best.	Empa o ne a ntse a lokela ho ba ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
There may be something even better at work.	Ho ka 'na ha e-ba le ntho e ntle le ho feta mosebetsing.
Everything before that worked well.	Tsohle pele ho moo li ne li sebetsa hantle.
There was no shame.	Ho ne ho se na lihlong.
This was fun.	Sena se ne se le monate.
I can't wait to find the time to read it.	Ke sitoa ho ema ho fumana nako ea ho e bala.
So here are my questions.	Kahoo lipotso tsa ka ke tsena.
Of course we did.	Ehlile re entse joalo.
But none of these are new.	Empa ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsena e ncha.
Outside there is an empty space.	Ka ntle ho na le sebaka se se nang letho.
Of course we do not.	Ke ’nete hore ha re etse joalo.
Everyone wants to play.	E mong le e mong o batla ho bapala.
However, there is still a long way to go.	Leha ho le joalo, ho sa ntse ho e-na le tsela e telele ea ho tsoela pele.
They never told me anything about it.	Ba ne ba eso ka ba mpolella letho ka taba eo.
Everyone should read these.	E mong le e mong o lokela ho bala tsena.
Must you go?	O tlameha ho tsamaea?
He was talking as he spoke.	O ne a bua a ntse a bua.
Drink water.	Noa metsi.
If he had.	Haeba a ne a na le.
You no longer need it.	Ha u sa e hloka.
However, my mother never told me the truth.	Leha ho le joalo, ’Mè ha aa ka a mpolella ’nete.
And he would do that.	Mme o ne a tla etsa jwalo.
Then you have to tell him.	Joale u lokela ho mo bolella.
It really seemed so fun.	Ehlile e ile ea bonahala e le monate haholo.
Days passed.	Matsatsi a feta.
It's not money at the moment.	Ha se chelete ka nako ena.
He loved danger, that was the reality of it.	O ne a rata kotsi, hoo e ne e le 'nete ea eona.
We have to do something.	Re tlameha ho etsa ho hong.
The children stopped.	Bana ba ile ba ema.
We will try to reach them on foot.	Re tla leka ho ba fihlela ka maoto.
It's almost time for bed.	E se e batla e le nako ea ho robala.
This is a little closer to her.	Sena se haufi hanyane le hae.
Age.	Lilemo.
She cried.	A lla.
Yes, he did.	E, o ile a etsa joalo.
He had to take it again.	O ne a lokela ho e nka hape.
But it is important.	Empa ho bohlokoa.
I see them.	Kea ba bona.
So it takes time.	Kahoo ho nka nako.
But there is not much time for that.	Empa haho nako e ngata bakeng sa seo.
Of course, more than that.	Ha e le hantle, ho feta moo.
But they will not reach us that way.	Empa ba ke ke ba re fihlela ka tsela eo.
He never wrote anything.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ngola letho.
Going forward, they will make sure that they do not make the same mistake again.	Ho ea pele, ba tla etsa bonnete ba hore ha ba sa tla etsa phoso e tšoanang hape.
It is the most important food of your day.	Ke lijo tsa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa tsa letsatsi la hau.
I loved doing that.	Ke ne ke rata ho etsa joalo.
Visit your family.	Etela lelapa la hao.
I just finished that and I love it.	Ke sa tsoa qeta hoo 'me ke e rata.
We talked for a long time several times.	Re ile ra bua ka nako e telele ka makhetlo a ’maloa.
However he did not need my help.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a sa hloke thuso ea ka.
And that was not the case at all.	'Me ho hang ho ne ho se joalo.
Maybe there was something there, but he didn't see it.	Mohlomong ho ne ho ena le se seng moo, empa o ne a sa se bone.
How old are you?	U lilemo li kae?
I said no, too.	Ka re che, hape.
We need your strength.	Re hloka matla a hao.
Shopping here is fun.	Ho reka mona ho monate.
But we are no longer working for ourselves.	Empa ha re sa sebetsa bakeng sa rona.
My father spoke up.	Ntate o ile a bua pele.
He was as innocent as a child.	O ne a se na molato joalo ka ngoana.
Things will come together if you want them to come together.	Lintho li tla kopana haeba u batla hore li kopane.
Write as you like.	Ngola kamoo u ratang kateng.
If you have a problem, just ask!	Haeba u na le bothata, botsa feela!
I am nothing.	ha ke letho.
She looks tired, she seems.	Ho bonahala eka o khathetse, o bonahala .
My father was a teacher.	Ntate e ne e le tichere.
It probably would have started.	Mohlomong e ka be e ile ea qala.
You think you can do anything!	U nahana hore u ka etsa eng kapa eng!
We are very strong.	Re matla haholo.
He wanted the night.	O ne a batla bosiu.
The pain of leaving.	Bohloko ba ho tloha.
, che.	, che.
We are glad you are here !.	Re thabela hore ebe u mona!.
I really didn't know what to think.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa tsebe hore na ke nahane eng.
The fun passed to me.	Monate o ile oa feta ho 'na.
Either way, he goes.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe, o ea tsamaea.
You do not have to be gentle.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u be bonolo.
I really didn't get along very well.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa kopane hantle.
Nothing much fun happens.	Ha ho letho le monate haholo le etsahalang.
You will know soon.	U tla tseba haufinyane.
It must now be visible.	E tlameha ebe joale e bonahala.
I want everyone to have something for tomorrow.	Ke batla hore bohle ba be le ho hong bakeng sa hosane.
For you it may not happen.	Ho uena ho ka 'na ha se ke ha etsahala.
I'm not sure what this means.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na sena se bolela eng.
You will not be able to.	U ke ke ua khona.
To me with all my phone.	Ho 'na le mohala oa ka kaofela.
I like to write.	Ke rata ho ngola.
It was painful.	E ne e le bohloko.
So he decided to make a proposal again.	Kahoo a etsa qeto ea ho etsa tlhahiso hape.
Use the time.	Sebelisa nako eo.
You should too.	Le uena u lokela ho etsa joalo.
It was the first time they had met.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele ba kopana.
I know how that works.	Kea tseba hore na seo se sebetsa joang.
Well, notice that.	Be, hlokomela seo.
But he was not my husband.	Empa e ne e se monna oa ka.
It is never something I like very much.	Ha ho mohla ntho eo ke e ratang haholo.
Enjoys the ride again.	E thabela ho palama hape.
It could be right, or not.	E ka ba hantle, kapa che.
He could only watch.	O ne a ka shebella feela.
They may offer it.	Ba ka 'na ba fana ka eona.
It will not take us years to learn.	Re ke ke ra nka lilemo ho ithuta.
It was just more than that.	Feela e ne e le ho feta moo.
How long will this take?	See se tla nka nako e kae?
Still, he loved it.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a e rata.
And the years will pass.	'Me lilemo li tla feta.
I want to win this team.	Ke batla ho hlola sehlopheng sena.
When he got there, he started to cry.	Ha a fihla moo, a lla.
I will see in my son.	Ke tla bona ho mora oa ka.
He does not like children.	Ha a rate bana.
We need their help.	Re hloka thuso ea bona.
He had to catch this now.	O ne a tlameha ho tšoara sena joale.
That's the best thing.	Ke eona ntho e ntle haholo.
Yes, that's the best idea.	E, ke maikutlo a molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He looked just like he looked now.	O ne a shebahala jwalo ka ha a shebahala jwale.
He was at home.	O ne a le hae.
We can say, the situation will not be easier.	Re ka re, boemo bo ka se be bonolo ho feta.
Expect to find everything.	Lebella ho fumana tsohle.
No one will come.	Ha ho le ea mong ea tla tla.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
I'll be back in a few hours.	Ke tla khutla ka mor'a lihora tse 'maloa.
She said she was happy.	O ile a re o thabile.
But what will they look like?	Empa ba tla shebahala joang?
This is my favorite time of the day.	Ena ke nako eo ke e ratang haholo ea letsatsi.
Many more.	Tse ling tse ngata.
We don't think it's a good idea.	Ha re nahane hore ke mohopolo o motle.
Enter today.	Kena kajeno.
He did not want to.	O ne a sa batle.
And he walked that way alone for a long time.	'Me o ne a tsamaea ka tsela eo a le mong ka nako e telele.
Anyone who could play well had a problem.	Mang kapa mang ea neng a khona ho letsa hantle o ne a na le bothata.
I did not say it.	Ha kea e bua.
It must be enough.	E tlameha ho lekana .
He seemed to be talking.	O ne a bonahala a bolela.
Maybe some water can help.	Mohlomong metsi a mang a ka thusa.
I really do not know why.	Ruri ha ke tsebe hore na hobaneng.
But we all knew.	Empa bohle re ne re tseba.
You just did it.	U sa tsoa e etsa.
After hours of this we would find nothing.	Ka mor'a lihora tsa sena re ne re ke ke ra fumana letho.
Nobody knew that.	Haho motho ya neng a tseba seo.
A loving person.	Motho ea ratang.
Then something amazing happened.	Eaba ho etsahala ntho e makatsang.
I can get it someday.	Nka e fumana ka letsatsi le leng.
They are both tired.	Ka bobeli ba khathetse.
I mean not.	Ke bolela hore ha ho joalo.
At that time.	Ka nako eo.
He refused to stand.	O ne a hana ho ema.
It's his car.	Ke koloi ea hae.
It really came to me.	Ka sebele e ile ea tla ho ’na.
All of this is true, and none of them are significant.	Tsena tsohle ke 'nete, 'me ha ho letho la tsona la bohlokoa.
They often did this.	Hangata ba ne ba etsa sena.
Sometimes that works, sometimes not so much.	Ka linako tse ling seo sea sebetsa, ka linako tse ling ha se joalo haholo.
Here it is.	Ke ena.
However, this is not true.	Leha ho le joalo, sena hase 'nete.
Of course it is.	Ehlile ho jwalo.
Sorry if it is too long.	Ke masoabi haeba e le nako e telele.
Everyone had a great time.	E mong le e mong o bile le nako e monate.
We all work much better.	Kaofela re sebetsa betere haholo.
So, I really take their time.	Joalo, ka 'nete nka nako ea bona.
Somewhere it has never been before.	Sebakeng se seng ha se eso be teng pele.
I'm not having fun.	Ha ke etse monate.
You love that baby.	U rata ngoana eo.
They had to be very tall, really.	Ba ne ba lokela ho ba telele haholo, ka 'nete.
This book is very personal to you.	Buka ena ke ea hau haholo.
I feel happy.	Ke ikutloa ke thabile.
I will not mention it here.	Nke ke ka e bua mona.
We really enjoy being together.	Re thabela ho ba hammoho haholo.
Maybe with his phone call.	Mohlomong ka mohala oa hae oa mohala.
he thought.	a nahana.
Our children will not understand.	Bana ba rona ba ke ke ba utloisisa.
I could not believe it.	Ha kea ka ka lumela.
You are a child.	U ngoana.
They may suggest that you talk to someone else.	Ba ka etsa tlhahiso ea hore u bue le motho e mong.
It does happen, though.	Hoa etsahala, leha ho le joalo.
Everyone knew he was going to be there.	E mong le e mong o ne a tseba hore o tla ba teng.
My parents understood.	Batsoali ba ka ba ile ba utloisisa.
They soon did so.	Kapele ba ile ba etsa joalo.
I can sleep on the floor.	Ke khona ho robala fatše.
Return with her husband.	Khutlela le monna oa hae.
I want to read it again.	Ke batla ho e bala hape.
His feelings were hurt.	Maikutlo a hae a ne a utloile bohloko.
All you have to do is fear.	Seo u lokelang ho se tšaba ke bohloko feela.
Thanks for watching !.	Kea leboha ka ho sheba!.
That was a mistake.	Eo e ne e le phoso.
I used to be an expert.	Ke kile ka ba setsebi.
He stood behind her.	A ema ka mora hae.
Then the people around us gave us a nice dinner.	Eaba batho ba haufi le rōna ba re fa lijo tsa mantsiboea tse ntle.
It did not start well.	Ha aa ka a qala hantle.
Bad thing.	Ntho e mpe.
But he will stand alone.	Empa o tla ema a le mong.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
We got a job.	Re ile ra fumana mosebetsi.
Make sure you spend enough time in the group.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u qeta nako e lekaneng sehlopheng.
But if.	Empa haeba.
And he did not come.	Mme ha a ka a tla.
I can only enjoy it.	Nka thabela feela.
And then there was the job offer.	'Me joale ho ne ho e-na le tlhahiso ea mosebetsi.
You can continue now.	U ka tsoela pele hona joale.
Too much later than ever before!	Ho ba morao haholo ho feta leha e le neng pele!
I see you crying about it.	Kea u bona u lla ka eona.
I made it look like that.	Ke entse hore ho bonahale joalo.
We will work with you.	Re tla sebetsa le uena.
I was not sure how to play it.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na nka e bapala joang.
You can't say what they think.	U ke ke ua bolela seo ba se nahanang.
A during the festival.	A nakong ea mokete.
It is not enough.	Ha ea lekana.
We are not what they want.	Ha re seo ba se batlang.
My father has a lot of money.	Ntate o na le chelete e ngata.
Sometimes children do not need any help and sometimes they need a lot.	Ka linako tse ling bana ha ba hloke thuso leha e le efe 'me ka linako tse ling ba hloka e ngata.
You must try if it works here.	U tlameha ho leka haeba e sebetsa mona.
I would not do that at home.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa joalo hae.
This was a strange thing.	Sena e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
So you have to look at your feet.	Kahoo u tlameha ho sheba maoto a hau.
It is clear to me that you have not.	Ho hlakile ho nna hore ha o eso.
She doesn't seem to care if her clothes fall off.	Ho bonahala a sa tsotelle hore na liaparo tsa hae li ka oa.
I am here tomorrow.	Ke mona hosane.
I thought you might like to try it.	Ke ne ke nahana hore u ka rata ho leka.
They can learn from you.	Ba ka u ithuta.
This gives him a clear understanding of the subject.	Sena se etsa hore a utloisise taba hantle.
I did just that.	Ke ile ka etsa joalo.
But we all know that life is not like that.	Empa bohle rea tseba hore bophelo ha bo joalo.
He eats his food quickly.	O ja lijo tsa hae kapele.
He loves her very much.	O mo rata haholo.
They are afraid of them and should be.	Ba ba tšaba 'me ba lokela ho ba joalo.
That's when he spoke.	Ke ha a bua.
Then he dropped the matter.	Eaba o tlohela taba eo.
It can be anyone.	E ka ba mang kapa mang.
He declined to comment.	O ne a hana ho bolela lebaka.
I have to refuse.	Ke tlameha ho hana.
Making dinner will be fun.	Ho etsa lijo tsa mantsiboea ho tla ba monate.
Most people had a good idea to sleep at home that night.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba e-na le kelello e ntle ea ho robala hae bosiung boo.
And nothing happens.	Mme ha ho letho le etsahalang.
I like coffee.	Ke rata kofi.
Like he wanted to do anything with me.	Ho rata hore o ne a batla ho etsa eng kapa eng le nna.
All the food was better than the last.	Lijo tsohle li ne li le betere ho feta tsa ho qetela.
Then read some more.	Ebe u bala tse ling hape.
I beg you.	Kea u kopa.
I have a picture of him.	Ke na le setšoantšo sa hae.
Busy.	Phathahane.
I can't be with him there today.	Ha ke khone ho ba le eena moo kajeno.
It is drinking water.	Ke ho noa metsi.
I understand that it is necessary.	Kea utloisisa hore hoa hlokahala.
I think you will.	Ke nahana hore u tla etsa joalo.
Maybe he should go.	Mohlomong o lokela ho tsamaea.
They know there is more to it than that.	Baa tseba hore ho na le molemo ho feta moo.
Now you know where you are.	Jwale o tseba moo o leng teng.
Walking is difficult after an accident.	Ho tsamaea ho thata ka mor'a kotsi.
It's really fun.	Ho monate ruri.
I think we can do that.	Ke nahana hore re ka etsa joalo.
Can you tell us about the past?	O ka re bolella ka nako e fetileng?
It has done a great job of making people want to call.	E entse mosebetsi o motle oa ho etsa hore batho ba batle mohala.
Let him do his job.	A etse mosebetsi oa hae.
I'm excited to have something new.	Ke thabetse ho ba le ntho e ncha.
First, they had to spend the first week alone.	Pele, ba ne ba tlameha ho qeta beke ea pele ba le bang.
He never gave up.	Ha ho mohla o kileng oa tlohela.
There must be more.	Ho tlameha ho ba le tse ling tse ngata.
That is why he wants to come here.	Ke ka hona a batlang ho tla mona.
Of course, it's very simple.	Ha e le hantle, ho bonolo haholo.
Look at old clothes.	Sheba liaparo tsa khale.
mother.	mme.
It was time to get dressed.	E ne e le nako ea ho apara.
I was just a boy.	Ke ne ke le moshanyana feela.
Your dog must be healthy.	Ntja ea hau e tlameha ho phela hantle.
Of not knowing what is behind him.	Ea ho se tsebe se ka mora hae.
So will I.	Le 'na ke tla be ke le joalo.
There is no such thing as a mind.	Ha ho ntho e kang kelello.
There was only the past.	Ho ne ho e-na le nako e fetileng feela.
Cycling to work is not for everyone.	Ho palama baesekele ho ea mosebetsing ha se ea motho e mong le e mong.
Soon, he found a place to stay.	Kapele, o ile a fumana sebaka sa ho lula.
They did everything for him.	Ba ile ba mo etsetsa ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
Well, thank you for that.	Be, kea leboha ka seo.
Just do it again and again.	Feela ho e etsa hape hape.
There is no room for error in this work.	Ha ho sebaka sa phoso mosebetsing ona.
It’s time to move on with something, he thought.	Ke nako ea ho tsoela pele ka ho hong, a nahana.
Obviously this is a mistake.	Ho hlakile hore sena ke phoso.
It’s not easy to make me want to go out and do it again.	Ha ho bonolo ho etsa hore ke batle ho tsoa le ho e etsa hape.
But think about it first.	Empa nahana ka eona pele.
A very important person.	Motho oa bohlokoa haholo.
That worked for both of them.	Seo se ile sa sebetsa ka bobeli.
I try to fix things.	Ke leka ho lokisa lintho.
But he was not sure.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe hantle.
Many other children decided not to stand.	Bana ba bang ba bangata ba ile ba etsa qeto ea hore ba se ke ba ema.
It is no longer useful to it.	Ha ho sa na thuso ho eona.
And they would not go out.	'Me ba ne ba ke ke ba tsoa.
I was very strong.	Ke ne ke le matla haholo.
He obtained a driver's license.	O ile a fumana lengolo la ho khanna.
Sometimes things take a little longer.	Ka linako tse ling lintho li nka nako e seng kae.
But nothing more.	Empa ha ho letho le leng hape.
And if you do not.	'Me haeba u sa etse joalo.
He ate a delicious breakfast.	O ile a ja lijo tsa hoseng tse monate.
That's not a bad thing, in my opinion.	Seo ha se ntho e mpe, ka maikutlo a ka.
He never went back.	Ha aa ka a khutlela morao.
What happened?	Ho ile ha etsahala'ng?
I knew you were doing one.	Ke ne ke tseba hore u etsa e le 'ngoe.
But they had to do it.	Empa ba ne ba tlameha ho etsa joalo.
He would never ask again.	O ne a sa tlo botsa hape.
There can be no such thing.	Ho ka se be le ntho e jwalo.
It is not for children.	Ha se ea bana.
I do not know them all.	Ha ke ba tsebe kaofela.
It's hard to open.	Ho thata ho bula.
However, that is what it is.	Leha ho le joalo, ke seo e leng sona.
He wondered how such a line could work.	A ipotsa hore na mohala o joalo o ka sebetsa joang.
But he was at home.	Empa o ne a le hae.
He has always loved to read.	Haesale a rata ho bala.
We are.	Re joalo.
It was not powerful.	E ne e se matla.
So we don't want that either.	Kahoo le rona ha re batle seo.
It was so nice when you stopped and talked to me.	Ho bile monate haholo ha o ile wa ema mme wa bua le nna.
I did not sleep last night.	Ha kea robala bosiung bo fetileng.
We did the fourth.	Re entse ea bone.
Because it is.	Hobane ho joalo.
In fact, there are three.	Ha e le hantle, ho na le tse tharo.
He likes to tell me who said what and when.	O rata ho mpolella hore na ke mang ea itseng le neng.
It is better to save time.	Ho molemo ho boloka nako.
But more money than you would expect.	Empa chelete e ngata ho feta kamoo u neng u ka e lebella.
And to let people know that he exists.	Le ho etsa hore batho ba tsebe hore o teng.
And we just made friends.	'Me re sa tsoa etsa metsoalle.
It is best not to be late for school.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua fihla morao sekolong.
He is really trying hard.	O leka ka matla ruri.
Our place is nothing but you.	Sebaka sa rona ha se letho ntle le uena.
Although he wanted to.	Leha a ne a batla.
But I try.	Empa kea leka.
He was in danger.	O ne a le sebakeng sa kotsi.
It is a very strange and powerful image.	Ke setšoantšo se makatsang le se matla haholo.
Maybe it was.	Mohlomong ho ne ho le jwalo.
These were happy times.	Tsena e ne e le linako tse monate.
Because it matters.	Hobane ho bohlokoa.
I'm here.	Ke teng mona.
Do so.	Ba etse joalo.
Instead, drink water.	Ho e-na le hoo, noa metsi.
Drink this, boy.	Noa sena, moshanyana.
You need to get a job.	U hloka ho fumana mosebetsi.
It was the most beautiful house.	E ne e le ntlo e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
And I was thinking of something like this.	Hape ke ne ke nahana ka ntho e kang ena.
It is still my opinion.	E ntse e le maikutlo a ka.
I mean it's not good at all.	Ke bolela hore ha e ntle ho hang.
They are even stronger.	Ba matla le ho feta.
Sure, we know.	Ka sebele, rea tseba.
This is what we are and we do it well.	Sena ke seo re leng sona mme re se etsa hantle.
He could see that she loved him more than anything.	O ne a bona hore o mo rata ho feta ntho leha e le efe.
We don't live where we used to live when you left home.	Ha re lule moo re neng re lula teng ha u tloha hae.
Buy a house.	Reka ntlo.
It will not work.	E ke ke ea sebetsa.
It will be fun.	Ho tla ba monate.
I do not like him.	Ha ke mo rate.
The money is there.	Chelete e teng.
Me and me and me.	Nna le nna le nna le nna.
We will never talk about it again.	Ha re sa tla hlola re bua ka eona hona joale.
My mother too loved him.	'Mè le eena o ile a mo rata haholo.
If they couldn't win, you're glad you did.	Haeba ba ne ba sa khone ho hlola, o thabela hore ebe u entse joalo.
I couldn't find it.	Ha kea khona ho e fumana.
But maybe it’s something else.	Empa mohlomong ke ntho e 'ngoe hape.
And, this is exactly what is happening.	'Me, sena se etsahala hantle.
There was a time when they could.	Ho na le nako eo ba neng ba ka khona.
Then they would come in again.	Joale ba ne ba tla kena hape.
He had never done that before.	O ne a eso ho ka a etsa hoo pele.
I love you and everyone.	Kea u rata le bohle.
They don't have to.	Ha ba a tlameha.
Something is going to happen.	Ntho e tla etsahala.
I still can't stand or walk alone.	Ke ntse ke sitoa ho ema kapa ho tsamaea ke le mong.
This is very good.	Sena se setle haholo.
I can't think of a thing.	Ha ke khone ho nahana taba.
I was strong.	Ke ne ke le matla.
That was the only way.	E ne e le eona feela tsela.
She was not beautiful.	O ne a se motle.
Maybe it would come back to him.	Mohlomong e ne e tla khutlela ho eena.
They both agreed.	Ka bobeli ba ile ba lumela.
No, it was more than that.	Che, ho ne ho feta moo.
I needed to make it better, work harder, fix it.	Ke ne ke hloka ho etsa betere, ho sebetsa ka thata, ho e lokisa.
Then he knew.	Eaba oa tseba.
You will see it again.	O tla e bona hape.
But now, there is nothing.	Empa jwale, haho letho.
Everyone loves to earn money.	E mong le e mong o rata ho fumana chelete.
We made money from it.	Re entse chelete ka eona.
I will be back very early in the morning.	Ke tla khutla hoseng haholo.
But he has an opinion.	Empa o na le maikutlo.
I need to hear this.	Ke hloka ho utloa sena.
If that is what you want.	Haeba ke seo u se batlang.
They can still do that.	Ba ntse ba ka etsa joalo.
Just right about the girl.	Hantle feela ka ngoanana.
I'm glad you enjoyed this book.	Ke thabela hore ebe u thabetse buka ena.
See you tomorrow.	Ke tla u bona hosane.
If they are here.	Haeba ba teng mona.
You can tell me.	O ka mpolella.
He has a simple style.	O na le mokhoa o bonolo.
They came to us.	Ba ile ba fihla ho rōna.
The man she did not want.	Monna eo a neng a sa mo batle.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
But that would not happen.	Empa hoo ho ne ho ke ke ha etsahala.
This has been a problem for many years.	Sena e bile bothata ka lilemo tse ngata.
Everyone here has something.	Motho e mong le e mong mona o na le ho hong.
Or food.	Kapa lijo.
When you receive the letter, open the door.	Ha u fumana lengolo, bula lemati.
There has to be one person.	Ho lokela hore ho be le motho a le mong.
She did what she could to help.	O ile a etsa sohle seo a ka se khonang ho thusa.
There must be a better way.	E tlameha ebe ho na le tsela e betere.
That news came true.	Litaba tseo e ile ea e-ba ’nete.
Really kind of weird.	Ruri mofuta o makatsang.
We did not see the children while we were there.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bona bana ha re le moo.
I did not see it.	Ha kea ka ka e bona.
That's right now.	Ke 'nete hona joale.
But he was more than that.	Empa o ne a feta moo.
And this was an everyday thing.	'Me sena e ne e le ntho ea letsatsi le letsatsi.
Try to find a way out.	Leka ho fumana tsela ea ho tsoa.
Surprisingly, he continued.	Ka mokhoa o makatsang, o ile a tsoela pele.
People come here because of the books.	Batho ba tla mona ka lebaka la libuka.
Picture of last week.	Setšoantšo sa beke e fetileng.
You heard him.	U mo utloile.
I want to buy with my own money.	Ke batla ho reka ka chelete ea ka.
The car is moving fast.	Koloi eo e tsamaea kapele.
It was just one of many.	E ne e le e 'ngoe feela ea tse ngata.
Che, che, che.	Che, che, che.
But they do nothing for us.	Empa ha ba re etse letho.
No one could say anything.	Ho ne ho se motho ya neng a ka bua letho.
It was too fast.	E ne e le kapele haholo.
So you eat as much as you can, if you can.	Kahoo u ja seo u ka se khonang, ha u khona.
I would probably say yes.	Mohlomong ke tla re e.
It is not an easy task.	Ha se mosebetsi o bonolo.
People love this place and live here.	Batho ba rata sebaka sena mme ba lula mona.
This is too bad to watch.	Sena se mpe haholo ho se shebella.
It is not real.	Ha se ntho ea sebele.
It was a real learning experience for me.	E ne e le mokhoa oa sebele oa ho ithuta ho 'na.
Or as long as you are still there.	Kapa ha feela o ntse o le teng.
Everyone has a past.	Motho e mong le e mong o na le nako e fetileng.
It is better not to stay here.	Ho molemo hore re se ke ra lula mona.
We passed there.	Re ile ra feta moo.
Because we are not human, you go to them.	Hobane ha re batho, o ya bona.
After that it was clear.	Ka mor'a moo ho ne ho hlakile.
I could not see my feet.	Ke ne ke sa bone maoto a ka.
Even easier than in previous years.	Leha ho le bonolo ho feta lilemo tse fetileng.
But not everyone was happy with it.	Empa hase bohle ba ileng ba thabela seo.
It was useless to continue.	Ho ne ho se na thuso ho tsoela pele.
And it is likely to say so.	'Me ho ka etsahala hore ebe ho bua joalo.
And it is true that we have been here before.	Hape ke 'nete hore re kile ra ba mona.
I would say we are happy.	Nka ba ka re re thabile.
Let him talk to me.	E re a bue le nna.
But some things were very good.	Empa lintho tse ling li ne li le ntle haholo.
Yes, they do.	E, ba etsa joalo.
I was the last to leave.	Ke bile oa ho qetela ho tsamaea.
I have never seen such a thing before.	Ha ke e-s'o bone e joalo pele.
That, to me, is important.	Seo, ho 'na, se bohlokoa.
Living a good life !.	Ho phela bophelo bo monate!.
But whatever you do, you must always do it.	Empa eng kapa eng eo u e etsang, u tlameha ho e etsa kamehla.
It could be even worse.	E ka ba mpe le ho feta.
So you do not know.	Kahoo ha u tsebe.
Many people say that it is something they love very much.	Batho ba bangata ba re ke ntho eo ba e ratang haholo.
He did not win.	Ha a ka a hlola.
They don't know anybody.	Ha ba tsebe motho.
Someone's life is in danger.	Bophelo ba motho e mong bo kotsing.
I'm good at this.	Ke hantle ho sena.
I want to get it.	Ke batla ho o fumana.
He has not spoken about it, so he has not done so.	Ha a e-so bue ka eona, kahoo le eena ha a e-so etse joalo.
The place is his.	Sebaka ke sa hae.
It's not for me.	Ha se ho 'na.
He took everything from me.	O nkile tsohle ho nna.
I would appreciate another help to understand this.	Ke tla leboha thuso e 'ngoe ho utloisisa sena.
It meant a lot of money.	Ho ne ho bolela chelete e ngata.
He will stand.	O tla ema.
I started to think that maybe it was a good time.	Ke ile ka qala ho nahana hore mohlomong ke nako e monate.
That is, we.	E leng hore, re.
I was just beginning to believe it.	Ke ne ke qala ho e lumela.
I can't be with him and do a lot of things.	Ha ke khone ho ba le eena le ho etsa lintho tse ngata.
He didn't finish watching.	Ha a ka a qeta ho shebella.
Now it is.	Hona joale ho joalo.
It is dangerous to walk alone.	Ho kotsi ho tsamaea u le mong.
I'm just doing this.	Ke mpa feela ke etsa sena.
However, you would not be able to do it right now.	Leha ho le joalo, u ne u ke ke ua khona ho e etsa hona joale.
Make it easy for them, don't you know.	Etsa hore ho be bonolo ho bona, na ha u tsebe.
I think that's probably wrong with me.	Ke nahana hore mohlomong ke sona se phoso ka nna.
But you are not sure how to do it.	Empa ha u na bonnete ba hore na u ka e etsa joang.
I never understood it.	Ha ke eso e utloisise.
Then, he said.	Joale, a re.
You have to ask how you can do this to him.	U lokela ho botsa hore na u ka etsa sena joang ho eena.
They told him not to treat people that way.	Ba ile ba mo bolella hore a se ke a tšoara batho ka tsela eo.
Now she feels better but still suffering.	Hona joale o ikutloa a le betere empa o ntse a utloa bohloko.
Of course, most people do not.	Ha e le hantle, batho ba bangata ha ba etse joalo.
I want you to find him.	Ke batla hore o mo fumane.
And that can be the case.	Le hore ho ka ba joalo.
It was clear what he was getting.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore o ne a fumana eng.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
I'll start with mine.	Ke tla qala ka ea ka.
But he did not thank her.	Empa ha aa ka a mo leboha.
That's not so bad.	Seo ha se mpe hakaalo.
You can't buy hard with us.	U ke ke ua reka ka thata le rona.
It was a lot, more than that.	E ne e le ngata, ho feta moo.
Thank you so much for this team.	Ke leboha haholo bakeng sa sehlopha sena.
Anyone with a team knows how difficult this can be.	Mang kapa mang ea nang le sehlopha oa tseba hore na sena se ka ba thata hakae.
Thank you for taking good care of my baby.	Kea leboha ha u ile ua hlokomela ngoana oa ka hantle.
They look great.	Li shebahala li le ntle.
I know people who need this.	Ke tseba batho ba hlokang sena.
He left.	O ile a tsamaea.
I don't want to see that thing again.	Ha ke batle ho bona ntho eo hape.
They do him a favor.	Ba mo etsetsa molemo.
He thought something good.	A nahana ntho e ntle.
If he could not pass.	Haeba a ne a sa khone ho feta.
The problem was that there were too many.	Bothata e ne e le hore ho ne ho le ngata haholo.
It was just a matter of time.	E ne e le taba ea nako feela.
Everyone who seeks will find.	E mong le e mong ea batlang o tla fumana.
He had been to this place many times.	O ne a ile a fihla sebakeng sena hangata.
Now I am alone.	Hona joale ke se ke le mong.
I spent a lot of time with them.	Ke qetile nako e ngata le bona.
I would have my friends.	Ke ne ke tla ba le metsoalle ea ka.
This is it.	Ena ke eona.
From now on.	Ho tloha joale.
But it happens almost never.	Empa ho etsahala hoo e ka bang ha ho mohla.
Or his son.	Kapa mora oa hae.
Hence, the name.	Kahoo, lebitso.
It's really simple.	E bonolo ruri.
I used to go to this school.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ho ea sekolong sena.
I want to fix something.	Ke batla ho lokisa ho hong.
But he refused.	Empa a hana.
They do not expect the same from everyone.	Ha baa lebella hore bohle ba fumane se tšoanang.
He has no chance.	Ha a na monyetla.
Of course, this is not the case here.	Ehlile, ha ho joalo mona.
All you need for.	Sohle seo u se hlokang bakeng sa.
Obviously, they had not read the book.	Ho hlakile hore ba ne ba sa bala buka eo.
I had been taking it ever since.	Ke ne ke ntse ke e nkile ho tloha ka nako eo.
Her children knew it.	Bana ba hae ba ne ba e tseba.
She watched him as he ate.	O ile a mo shebella ha a ntse a ja.
This, of course, should not happen.	Sena, ehlile, ha sea lokela ho etsahala.
I don’t think most people know.	Ha ke nahane hore batho ba bangata ba tseba.
We can talk.	Re ka bua.
I have time.	Ke na le nako.
But it will not help.	Empa e ke ke ea thusa.
He drove his car carelessly.	O ile a khanna koloi ea hae a sa tsotelle.
I was alive but not educated.	Ke ne ke phela empa ha kea ithuta.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
It was fun.	Ho ne ho le monate.
I wanted to sit down and think for a moment.	Ke ne ke batla ho lula fatše ke nahane ho se hokae.
For their family.	Bakeng sa lelapa la bona.
He will not care if you sleep there.	A ka se tsotelle ha o robala moo.
Work is busy here.	Mosebetsi o phathahane mona.
We just love him.	Re mpa re mo rata.
If the water is on time, it is even better.	Haeba metsi a le ka nako, ho molemo le ho feta.
You have to stop, both of you.	Le tlameha ho ema, bobeli ba lona.
And you continued to be alone after a long time.	'Me u ile ua tsoela pele ho ba mong ka mor'a nako e telele.
I looked at it now.	Ka e sheba jwale.
The years went by.	Lilemo tsa tsamaea.
I have no problem talking about it.	Ha ke na bothata ba ho bua ka eona.
Everything is important.	Ntho e ngoe le e ngoe e bohlokoa.
Do not do what my mother and I did.	O seke wa etsa seo nna le mme re se entseng.
They eat a lot.	Ba ja haholo.
So think again.	Kahoo nahana hape.
Maybe they will.	Mohlomong ba tla ea.
Then again, maybe he is.	Joale hape, mohlomong ke eena.
He said it was individual.	O itse ke motho ka mong.
Do not wish or refuse.	U se ke ua lakatsa kapa ua hana.
That, of course, is human.	Seo, ehlile, ke motho.
He decided to go, deciding not to go.	O ile a nahana ho tsamaea, a etsa qeto ea ho se ee.
I didn't care for that.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle seo.
I will see it.	ke tla e bona.
So keep the problem and tell the truth.	Kahoo boloka bothata 'me u bue 'nete.
Another reason he could not love her.	Lebaka le leng leo ka lona a neng a ke ke a mo rata.
I do not want to have sex with you.	Ha ke batle ho robala le wena.
Yet they keep coming.	Leha ho le joalo ba tsoela pele ho tla.
He was a shy kid.	E ne e le ngoana ea lihlong.
I try to learn a lot just for fun.	Ke leka ho ithuta haholo bakeng sa monate feela.
That was his first thought.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo oa hae oa pele.
Honestly, you can live without them.	Ho bua 'nete, u ka khona ho phela ntle le tsona.
The doctor agreed.	Ngaka e ile ea lumela.
Some were nearby.	Ba bang ba ne ba le haufi.
I've never been one to do that.	Ha ke eso be motho ya ka etsang hoo.
I do not know such a thing.	Ha ke tsebe ntho e joalo.
Their time was very good.	Nako ea bona e ne e le ntle haholo.
I like news.	Ke rata litaba.
But they will never forget it.	Empa ba ke ke ba e lebala.
They really were there.	Ba ne ba hlile ba le teng.
I think you will really enjoy it.	Ke nahana hore u tla e thabela haholo.
You may like it.	U ka e rata.
He always talks.	O dula a bua.
However, this place was not ideal.	Leha ho le joalo, sebaka sena se ne se se ntle.
Use these to take advantage of the situation.	Sebelisa tsena ho nka monyetla ka boemo.
Someone came in.	Ho ile ha kena motho e mong.
The woman was happy.	Mosali eo o ne a thabile.
I will never do that again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke etsa hoo.
If you do, something new is happening.	Haeba u etsa joalo, ho etsahala ntho e ncha.
Or rather, they speak.	Kapa ho e-na le hoo, baa bua.
I can feel it.	Ke khona ho e utloa.
He had done all he could, and none of them was enough.	O ne a entse sohle seo a ka se khonang, 'me ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona e neng e lekana.
And we would talk.	Mme re ne re tla bua.
My room can be enough for yours.	Kamore ea ka e ka lekana ho ea hau.
That car is very new.	Koloi eo e ncha haholo.
Are you afraid of what might happen?	Na u tšaba se ka ’nang sa etsahala?
So you haven't seen it.	Kahoo ha o eso e bone.
She had heard him speak.	O ne a mo utloile a bua.
That thing is very good.	Ntho eo e ntle haholo.
This is not very good, but it is good.	Sena ha se hantle haholo, empa se molemo.
She can't look at him.	Ha a khone ho mo sheba.
He knew enough not to tell them that.	O ne a tseba ho lekana hore a se ke a ba bolella seo.
We call everyone.	Re letsetsa motho e mong le e mong.
He was in pain.	O ne a utloa bohloko.
However, there was still some way to go.	Leha ho le joalo ho ne ho ntse ho e-na le tsela e itseng ea ho tsamaea.
It will never be a problem for me.	Ho hang e ke ke ea e-ba bothata ho 'na.
It can happen at any time.	E ka etsahala nakong efe kapa efe.
I wanted to be with him.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba le eena.
I would say something to her.	Ke ne ke tla bua ho hong ho eena.
It's nice to see you.	Ho monate ho o bona.
It's too late to come in the morning.	E se e le morao ho tla hoseng.
You know it's weird.	Ua tseba hore ke ntho e makatsang.
However, he finally nodded in agreement.	Leha ho le joalo, qetellong o ile a lumela ka hlooho.
And you can do nothing.	Hape u ke ke ua etsa letho.
What we can think of does not matter.	Seo re ka se nahanang ha se na taba.
In time, we came to love it.	Ha nako e ntse e ea, re ile ra e rata.
Nothing like that happens.	Ha ho ntho e kang eo e etsahalang.
They don't have that kind of power.	Ha ba na matla a mofuta oo.
I understand, no problem.	Kea utloisisa, ha ho bothata.
First and foremost.	Ea pele le feela.
There is only one of you.	Ho na le a le mong feela wa lona.
There was a reason for this, and no one knew it better than he did.	Ho ne ho e-na le lebaka la sena, 'me ho ne ho se ea e tsebang ho feta eena.
All night long, of course.	Bosiu bohle, ruri.
So just in time.	Kahoo feela ka nako.
I began to think about traveling alone.	Ke ile ka qala ho nahana ho tsamaea ke le mong.
Driving at night is dangerous.	Ho khanna bosiu ho kotsi.
It is not easy.	Ha ho bonolo.
Our clothes are wet.	Liaparo tsa rona li metsi.
To begin with.	Ho qala joalo ka.
I had it, and it was mine.	Ke ne ke e-na le eona, ’me e ne e le ea ka.
Have you finished work?	A na u se u qetile mosebetsi?
I could see that she was crying.	Ke ile ka bona hore oa lla.
You and others don't care about me.	Wena le ba bang ha le na taba ho nna.
The other group is very fun.	Sehlopha se seng se monate haholo.
It is important for his family to know that too.	Ho bohlokoa hore lelapa la hae le lona le tsebe seo.
He was great in every way.	O ne a le moholo ka tsela tsohle.
You have to suffer.	U tlameha ho utloa bohloko.
They did not come.	Ha ba ka ba tla.
For us it was the last.	Ho rona e bile ea ho qetela.
The car started to move forward.	Koloi ea qala ho ea pele.
You can read them.	U ka li bala.
It does nothing to you.	Ha e o etse letho.
We did it before.	Re e entse pele.
I felt the need to say something about this.	Ke ile ka utloa ho hlokahala hore ke bue ho hong ka taba ena.
Some money is better than no money at all.	Chelete e 'ngoe e molemo ho feta ho hloka chelete.
He counted all the money.	O ile a bala chelete eohle.
It was not a good picture.	E ne e se setšoantšo se setle.
I feel fast.	Ke ikutloa kapele.
You talk about your friends in the background.	U bua ka metsoalle ea hau ka morao.
His wife did not give him children.	Mosali oa hae ha aa mo fa bana.
I was planning my life.	Ke ne ke rera bophelo ba ka.
The old house was very nice.	Ntlo ea khale e ne e le ntle haholo.
There are foods if you want, please have them.	Ho na le lijo haeba u batla, ke kopa u be le tsona.
I only enjoy food.	Ke thabela lijo feela.
We keep it real.	Re e boloka e le ea sebele.
He had to understand why we came to him.	O ne a tlameha ho utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha re tla ho eena.
There is no easy way out.	Haho tsela e bonolo.
I was done.	Ke ne ke qetile.
I let her go and started to dress.	Ke ile ka mo tlohela eaba ke qala ho apara.
And that means something else.	Mme seo se bolela se seng.
He no longer wanted to be there.	O ne a se a sa batle ho ba moo.
I need you, he thought.	Kea u hloka, o ile a nahana joalo.
The presentation is simple.	Tlhahiso e bonolo.
Let it be so.	A ho be jwalo.
He too could walk fast.	Le eena o ne a khona ho tsamaea kapele.
He made you think.	O entse hore o nahane.
But there is no way to do that.	Empa haho mokhoa oa ho etsa joalo.
More than other times of the day.	Ho feta linako tse ling tsa letsatsi.
That is what we need.	Ke seo re se hlokang.
That has never happened before.	Seo ha se e-so ka se etsahala pele.
This is an amazing place to stay.	Sena ke sebaka se makatsang ho lula.
I like that sometimes.	Ke rata seo ka nako e 'ngoe.
They take a long time to write.	Ba nka nako e telele ho ngola.
But neither of them understood what he was really feeling.	Empa ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a utloisisa hore na ha e le hantle o ne a ikutloa joang.
I am very happy for them.	Ke ba thabetse haholo.
Some have not been able to do this.	Ba bang ha baa ka ba khona ho etsa sena.
There must be something wrong.	E tlameha ebe ho na le phoso.
This is simple.	Ena e bonolo.
That's none of my business.	Ha se taba ea ka eo.
He never got anything.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a fumana letho.
You knew how much it meant to me.	U ne u tseba hore na e bolela hakae ho 'na.
The same is true of them.	Ho joalo le ka bona.
Sometimes that works.	Ka linako tse ling seo sea sebetsa.
It's your turn now.	Ke nako ea hau joale.
It was a great place to work.	E ne e le sebaka se setle sa ho sebetsa.
I love you both.	Ke le rata ka bobeli.
But second.	Empa ea bobeli .
It had to be strong.	E ne e lokela ho ba matla.
To them.	Ho ho bona.
I continued.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele.
You feel that he should not enter.	U na le maikutlo a hore ha aa lokela ho kena.
However, it was not just that.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se hoo feela.
It gave him time to plan.	E ile ea mo fa nako ea ho rera.
They were paying very well at the time.	Ba ne ba lefa hantle haholo ka nako eo.
He thought carefully before agreeing.	O ile a nahana ka hloko pele a lumela.
Eventually it will appear.	Qetellong e tla bonahala.
And about us.	Le ka rona.
He didn't take it.	Ha a ka a e nka.
We did not have much time.	Re ne re se na nako e ngata.
My father does the same.	Ntate o etsa se tšoanang.
I thought this is where it should be.	Ke ne ke nahana hore mona ke moo e neng e lokela ho ba teng.
We will leave soon.	Re tla tloha kapele.
And we don't know why.	Mme ha re tsebe lebaka.
And that happens.	Mme hoo ho a etsahala.
We noticed some people walking by.	Re ile ra hlokomela batho ba bang ba tsamaea.
Life does not always go that way.	Hangata bophelo ha bo tsamaee ka tsela eo.
So once they are done.	Kahoo hang ha ba qetile.
He is strong.	O matla.
I want to talk a little bit about why we are here today.	Ke batla ho bua hanyane ka hore na ke hobane'ng ha re le mona kajeno.
I think so.	Ke nahana hore ho joalo.
Obviously this is a long-term thing.	Ho hlakile hore sena ke ntho ea nako e telele.
He does not like to stand.	Ha a rate ho ema.
Of course you can.	Ke 'nete hore u ka khona.
He had one of them.	O ne a e-na le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
The doctor asked the man if he had any pain.	Ngaka e ile ea botsa monna eo hore na o tšoeroe ke bohloko.
It was bad.	E ne e le e mpe.
He could not believe that this was happening.	O ne a sa lumele hore sena se etsahala.
Sometimes it will be so.	Ka linako tse ling ho tla ba joalo.
This does not take long.	Sena ha se nke nako e telele.
And, like our house, there is nothing for friends.	'Me, joaloka ntlo ea rona, ha ho letho la metsoalle.
What they used to do often.	Seo ba neng ba se etsa hangata.
You need to do something about it.	O lokela ho etsa ho hong ka seo.
That would work just fine.	Seo se ne se tla sebetsa hantle feela.
Anyway, I see it now.	Leha ho le joalo, kea e bona hona joale.
This is how it always worked.	Ena ke tsela eo e neng e sebetsa ka eona kamehla.
It's hard for me to love her.	Ho thata hore ke mo rate.
It has made my life a lot easier.	E entse hore bophelo ba ka bo be bonolo haholoanyane.
That's what you have to do.	Ke seo o lokelang ho se etsa.
He once said that to me.	O kile a bua joalo ho 'na.
Then he did not go.	Eaba ha a ea.
Thank goodness!	Ke leboha molemo!
He went to work immediately.	O ile a ea mosebetsing kapele.
However, they did try.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ile ba leka.
He will certainly come.	Ruri o tla tla.
Here is a picture of my real car.	Mona ke setšoantšo sa koloi ea ka ea sebele.
It is not that difficult to do.	Ha ho thata hakaalo ho e etsa.
It's not my job.	Ha se mosebetsi oa ka.
She is very good to her children.	O molemo haholo ho bana ba hae.
Then, something amazing happened.	Joale, ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang ka ho fetisisa.
It is not.	Ha se.
We saw nothing.	Re ne re sa bone letho.
Not many.	Ha li ngata.
I am human.	Ke motho.
It is a real room.	Ke kamore ea 'nete.
We spend a week in this work.	Re qeta beke mosebetsing ona.
That is a psychological issue.	Taba eo ke taba ea kelello.
You can take anyone you want.	U ka nka mang kapa mang eo u mo batlang.
And there is a problem with us.	Mme bothata bo teng ka rona.
But he refused to do it.	Empa a hana ho e etsa.
But if you can tell someone, you know what will happen.	Empa ha o ka bolella motho, o tseba se tla etsahala.
Can we buy new shoes?	A na re ka reka lieta tse ncha?
We were equal.	Re ne re lekana.
It is not suitable for children at all.	Ha ea lokela bana ho hang.
From everyone, all of you.	Ho tsoa ho bohle, kaofela ha lona.
You need to understand this.	U lokela ho utloisisa sena.
He had seen it all his life, of course.	O ne a e bone bophelo bohle ba hae, ha e le hantle.
He is coming here.	O tla mona.
However, he knew that this would not happen.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a tseba hore seo se ke ke sa etsahala.
I need everyone to understand and hear that.	Ke hloka hore bohle ba utloisise le ho utloa seo.
Your benefit should be adequate.	Molemo oa hau o lokela ho ba o lekaneng.
I really believe in this team.	Ke lumela haholo sehlopheng sena.
No one is outside.	Ha ho motho ea ka ntle.
He did everything.	O entse tsohle.
I just learned that about him today.	Ke sa tsoa ithuta seo ka eena kajeno.
But we do not think so.	Empa ha re nahane joalo.
I have no money.	Ha ke na chelete.
I always slept there.	Kamehla ke ne ke robala moo.
It would be dangerous for him to do so.	Ho ka ba kotsi haeba a ka etsa joalo.
The same is true of him.	Ho joalo le ka eena.
We need to do something.	Re hloka ho etsa ho hong.
We must make sure that such a thing does not happen again.	Re tlameha ho etsa bonnete ba hore ntho e joalo ha e sa etsahala hape.
He fell asleep this morning.	O ile a robala hoseng hona.
Maybe it was my problem.	Mohlomong e ne e le bothata ba ka.
I know you know.	Kea tseba hore oa tseba.
I love my children and I love being a mother.	Ke rata bana ba ka mme ke rata ho ba mme.
It is easy to drive this car.	Ho bonolo ho khanna koloi ena.
You know we don't have that.	O ya tseba hore ha re na seo.
Now it's gone.	Jwale e ile.
It was a good thing.	E ne e le ntho e ntle.
He never liked to call other people there.	O ne a e-s'o ka a rata ho letsetsa batho ba bang teng.
My opinion, there is none.	Maikutlo a ka, ha a eo.
I never thought he would be older than I was.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore o tla ba moholo ho mpheta.
His feelings were strong.	Maikutlo a hae a ne a le matla.
I did not expect to get there.	Ke ne ke sa lebella ho fihla moo.
I want this.	Ke batla sena.
And then it does.	Mme ebe e etsa jwalo.
However, it was a close thing.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le ntho e haufi.
None of his friends have ever seen him again.	Ha ho le ea mong oa metsoalle ea hae ea kileng a mo bona hape.
There were so many things he wanted to ask.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a neng a batla ho li botsa.
It never was.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ya ba jwalo.
I feel guilty.	Ke ikutloa ke le molato.
Everyone was like that.	E mong le e mong o ne a le joalo.
I'm sure of that.	Ke na le bonnete ka seo.
We will do it again this week.	Re tla e etsa hape bekeng ena.
Of course, it was the other way around.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le ka tsela e ’ngoe.
I have never taken anything.	Ha ke eso nke letho.
He wanted another job instead of manual labor.	O ne a batla mosebetsi o mong ho e-na le mosebetsi oa matsoho.
Their age and age and age.	Lilemo le lilemo le lilemo tsa bona.
Time always goes ahead.	Nako e ya pele kamehla.
I drive to work almost every day.	Ke khanna ho ea mosebetsing hoo e ka bang letsatsi le leng le le leng.
Seeing children learn.	Ho bona bana ba ithuta.
However, he knew it was there.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a tseba hore e teng.
That was the first time for me.	Eo e ne e le lekhetlo la pele ho 'na.
This route goes smoothly.	Tsela ena e tsamaea hantle.
We will have a baby.	Re tla ba le ngoana.
If we happen to see it.	Haeba ho etsahala hore re e bone.
It was everyday life.	E ne e le bophelo ba letsatsi le letsatsi.
We could do with some food too.	Re ne re ka etsa ka lijo tse ling hape.
I wanted to ask you about that.	Ke ne ke batla ho o botsa ka seo.
I want to win today.	Ke batla ho hlola kajeno.
But only here.	Empa mona feela.
I don't want that either.	Le nna ha ke batle seo.
One is not very good.	E 'ngoe ha e ntle haholo.
Because, after all, you don’t need them.	Hobane, ka mor'a tsohle, ha u li hloke.
He is no longer with us.	Ha a sa na le rona.
He did it often.	O ne a etsa hangata.
You just feel better.	U ikutloa betere feela.
But we are not talking about that.	Empa ha re bue ka taba eo.
They have a high opinion.	Ba na le maikutlo a phahameng.
Then it was time.	Joale e ne e le nako.
However, no one came out, it just stayed.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho ea ileng a tsoa, ​​e ile ea lula feela.
They usually stand next to the dog.	Hangata li ema haufi le ntja.
Do not call again.	Se ke oa letsa hape.
How long before it starts working please.	Ke nako e kae pele e qala ho sebetsa ka kopo.
Then we would be a real family.	Joale re ne re tla ba lelapa la sebele.
I think you have a lot in common.	Ke nahana hore le na le lintho tse ngata tseo le tšoanang ka tsona.
Maybe I'm thinking of another guy.	Mohlomong ke nahana ka mohlankana e mong.
It looks very good.	Ho shebahala hantle haholo.
But we have to work.	Empa re tlameha ho sebetsa.
They could be much better next year.	Ba ka ba betere haholo selemong se tlang.
You can't say anything, you know?	U ke ke ua bua eng kapa eng, ua tseba?
He watched intently.	O ile a shebella ka hloko.
But these may not be the case.	Empa tsena li ka 'na tsa se ke tsa e-ba teng.
I didn’t think of it as anything other than what it was.	Ke ne ke sa nahane ka eona e le ntho e 'ngoe ntle le seo e neng e le sona.
The children are happy.	Bana ba thabile.
Maybe that's why he said it.	Mohlomong ke kahoo a ileng a e bua.
I love them both very much.	Ke ba rata haholo ka bobeli.
He can stand.	A ka ema.
My real life.	Bophelo ba ka ba sebele.
It's so much better.	Ho betere haholo.
I always knew.	Ke ne ke tseba ka linako tsohle.
I will always get the same, please.	Ke tla fumana se tšoanang le kamehla, ka kopo.
I'll think about it.	Ke tla e nahana.
I'm sorry about that.	Ke masoabi ka seo.
But we can trust what we know.	Empa re ka tšepa seo re se tsebang.
When he has to, until he speaks.	Ha a tlameha, ho fihlela a bua.
I want us to be friends.	Ke batla hore re be metsoalle.
So go for it.	Kahoo tsamaea bakeng sa eona.
That was easier said than done.	Seo se ne se le bonolo ho feta ho se etsa.
The car looked good.	Koloi e ne e shebahala hantle.
He could not do anything.	O ne a sa khone ho etsa leha e le efe.
With him, you can do whatever you like.	Le eena, u ka etsa seo u se ratang.
Because that is where they are.	Hobane ke hona moo ba leng teng.
However, calling here is a mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, ho letsetsa mona ke phoso.
I'm so happy to be with us.	Ke thabile haholo ho ba le rona.
But live with it every day.	Empa phela le eona letsatsi le letsatsi.
We both loved it.	Ka bobeli re ne re e rata.
Although the problem is.	Leha bothata e le .
You are not eating well.	Ha o je hantle.
It was difficult to read his thoughts.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bala maikutlo a hae.
In other words, however, life can be more enjoyable every day.	Leha ho le joalo, ka tsela e 'ngoe, bophelo bo ka lula bo le monate haholo letsatsi le leng le le leng.
Probably never.	Mohlomong ha ho mohla.
That should have been better.	Seo se ne se lokela ho ba molemo.
It can never be true.	Ho hang e ke ke ea e-ba ’nete.
No, we live together.	Che, re lula hammoho.
It is not clear what it is about.	Ha se hantle hore na e bua ka eng.
However, they had to do this.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba tlameha ho etsa sena.
It is one book.	Ke buka e le 'ngoe.
He could not see.	O ne a se a sa bone.
If so, what is the best way to do this?	Haeba ho joalo, mokhoa oa ho etsa sena ke ofe.
Because sometimes we do.	Hobane ka linako tse ling re etsa joalo.
He really did not need it.	O ne a hlile a sa e hloke.
It no longer exists, it no longer exists.	Ha e sa le teng, ha e sa le teng.
It was the only way to get in.	E ne e le eona feela tsela ea ho kena.
People have met.	Batho ba kopane.
A place where people can be alone.	Sebaka seo batho ba ka bang bang.
I will fix that soon.	Ke tla lokisa seo haufinyane.
We are not.	Ha re joalo.
Many more are available.	Tse ling tse ngata li teng.
Working with us is easy.	Ho sebetsa le rona ho bonolo.
Talk to them.	Bua le bona.
He spoke harshly.	O ile a bua ka thata.
He said people should be treated equally.	O ile a re batho ba lokela ho tšoaroa ka ho lekana.
His mother is.	'M'e oa hae ke.
We'll be back to work soon.	Re khutlela mosebetsing haufinyane.
I didn't need to play anymore.	Ke ne ke sa hloke ho bapala hape.
Getting there is easy.	Ho fihla moo ho bonolo.
Do it right, and it is there.	E etse hantle, 'me e teng.
This is all we want.	Sena ke sona feela seo re se batlang.
I think he will love you as soon as he knows you.	Ke nahana hore o tla u rata hang ha a u tseba.
It does not make it easy.	Ha e etse hore ho be bonolo.
Water is very important.	Metsi ke a bohlokoa haholo.
They were moving fast.	Ba ne ba tsamaea kapele.
This is easy.	Sena se bonolo.
If you really need this then there is something wrong.	Haeba u hlile u hloka sena joale ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
It can be fun.	E ka ba monate.
But a great idea.	Empa mohopolo o moholo.
Maybe this can help you.	Mohlomong sena se ka u thusa.
To each of his.	Ho e mong le e mong oa hae.
He had no weapon.	O ne a sena sebetsa.
What was he talking about.	O ne a bua ka eng.
In fact, he is useless.	Ha e le hantle, ha a na thuso.
I want my room.	Ke batla kamore ea ka.
And you will feel better about it.	'Me o tla ikutloa betere ka eona.
I did not find her.	Ha kea mo fumana.
The housewife came in with food and water.	'Mè oa ntlo o ile a kena a nkile lijo le metsi.
I would like to retire.	Ke kopa ho tlohela mosebetsi.
His working life also went well.	Bophelo ba hae ba mosebetsi le bona bo ile ba tsamaea hantle.
I have a headache.	Ke na le hlooho e thata.
He told her never to do that again.	O ile a mo bolella hore a se ke a hlola a etsa joalo.
You have three.	U na le tse tharo.
It is very dangerous.	E kotsi haholo.
He felt much better after eating.	O ile a ikutloa a le betere haholo ka mor'a ho ja.
He won't be here now.	Ha a sa tla ba teng jwale.
Now we meet again.	Hona joale re kopana hape.
Now it was mine.	Hona joale e ne e le ea ka.
And there it was.	Mme e ne e le teng.
I'm very close, too.	Ke haufi haholo, hape.
There was not much we could talk about.	Ho ne ho se na lintho tse ngata tseo re ka buang ka tsona.
It is easy to say that.	Ho bonolo ho bua joalo.
It has just entered the area.	E sa tsoa kena sebakeng seo.
We believe so.	Re lumela hore ho joalo.
It would be great.	E ka ba hantle haholo.
I visited her at her home.	Ke ile ka mo etela ha hae.
We do not need it.	Ha re e hloke.
It is also ignorance.	Hape ke ho se tsebe.
They have to have more.	Ba tlameha ho ba le ho feta.
Certainly not.	Ka sebele ba ne ba se joalo.
Now, open.	Jwale, bula.
He did not want her to do this.	O ne a sa batle hore a etse sena.
I would love to talk to you if you can.	Ke rata ho bua le uena ha u khona.
I loved her so much.	Ke ne ke mo rata haholo.
It takes a long time and comes out.	E nka nako e telele 'me e tsoa ka ntle.
That is very painful.	Seo se bohloko haholo.
We were better than that, but we didn't play like that.	Re betere ho feta moo, empa ha rea ​​ka ra bapala joalo.
Sometimes they tried strange things.	Ka linako tse ling ba ne ba leka lintho tse makatsang.
And this is not enough.	Le hona ha hoa lekana.
They did not see us.	Ha ba ka ba re bona.
He just, really, doesn't care.	O mpa feela, ruri, ha a tsotelle.
He wanted to go back home.	O ne a batla ho khutlela hae.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
And he asked.	Mme a botsa.
The party went on all night.	Mokete o ile oa tsoela pele bosiu bohle.
Thanks for understanding.	Ke leboha ho utloisisa.
Best of all he did not tell her, any of it.	Molemo ka ho fetisisa hore ebe ha aa ka a mo bolella, leha e le efe ea eona.
They have to get something from the person.	Ba lokela ho fumana ho hong ho motho.
You do not have to do many things for them.	Ha ua tlameha ho ba etsetsa lintho tse ngata.
Drink like coffee.	Noa joalo ka kofi.
He obviously does not need a car or a house.	Ho hlakile hore ha a hloke koloi kapa ntlo.
Then the last thought.	Joale mohopolo oa ho qetela.
Previously they were human.	Pele e ne e le batho.
Every doctor had it.	Ngaka e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e e-na le eona.
It was like a whole past life.	E ne eka ke bophelo bohle bo fetileng.
She looked at him suspiciously.	A mo sheba a belaela.
We are never like that.	Ha ho mohla re leng joalo.
I do not know when.	Ha ke tsebe neng.
But with me or without me, it would happen.	Empa ka nna kapa ntle ho nna, e ne e tla etsahala.
It was very difficult.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo.
Of what he did not have, and never will be again.	Ea seo a neng a se na sona, 'me ha a sa tla hlola a e-ba teng.
He had children in the back.	O ne a e-na le bana ka morao.
So this is fun.	Kahoo sena se monate.
It can still be, of course.	Ho ntse ho ka ba joalo, ehlile.
But knowing is not enough.	Empa ho tseba ha hoa lekana.
He didn't even have to do a lot of toys.	O ne a sa tlameha le ho etsa lintho tse ngata tsa ho bapala.
His feelings were irrational.	Maikutlo a hae a ne a se na kelello.
They never think they will, but they do.	Ha ho mohla ba nahanang hore ba tla etsa joalo, empa ba etsa joalo.
That house is dangerous.	Ntlo eo e kotsi.
I had books.	Ke ne ke e-na le libuka.
I was not able to have children anymore.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ba le bana hape.
Kick ass.	E monate haholo.
No one will hand over your letter.	Ha ho motho ea tla fana ka lengolo la hau.
I looked at the matter carefully.	Ke ile ka sheba taba eo hantle.
Don't try.	Le seke la leka.
I hope it will help you, too!	Ke tšepa hore e tla u thusa, le uena!
But this is not the case.	Empa ha e le hantle sena ha se joalo.
They can keep many of their questions.	Ba ka boloka lipotso tsa bona tse ngata.
I called again, again, and again.	Ka letsa hape, hape, le hape.
It seemed pointless to ask.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na thuso ea ho botsa.
But a lot of people.	Empa batho ba bangata.
Any boy except you, of course.	Moshanyana ofe kapa ofe ntle le uena, ehlile.
Maybe we will never meet again.	Mohlomong ha re sa tla hlola re kopana.
I had one of them.	Ke ne ke e-na le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
It's nice to meet you.	Ke thabela ho kopana le uena.
You don't need that.	Ha o hloke seo.
He had nothing to speak about.	O ne a sena letho leo a ka buang ka lona.
That was fun.	Seo se ne se le monate.
Maybe that's how it should be.	Mohlomong ho joalo kamoo ho lokelang ho ba kateng.
Unless they got home.	Ntle le ha ba ka ba fihla hae.
It was very painful for us.	Ho bile bohloko haholo ho rona.
That was not necessary.	Seo se ne se sa hlokahale.
That work never came out.	Ha ho mohla mosebetsi oo o kileng oa tsoa.
You can no longer win.	U ke ke ua hlola.
Where do you start with them.	O qala kae ka tsona.
Well, a few things.	Hantle, lintho tse 'maloa.
This was also the case here.	Le mona ho ne ho le joalo.
I go first tomorrow.	Ke ea pele hosane.
They did not stay long.	Ha baa ka ba ema nako e telele.
It's so nice to meet you.	Ho monate haholo ho kopana le wena.
I would appreciate if you could continue with this in the future.	Ke tla leboha ha o ka tsoela pele ka sena nakong e tlang.
I had no idea what had happened.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe se etsahetseng.
The boy does not know what he is talking about.	Moshanyana ha a tsebe seo a se buang.
I thought about it for a long time.	Ke ile ka nahana ka eona nako e telele.
We may wonder why.	Re ka ipotsa hore na hobaneng.
Work is very important.	Mosebetsi o bohlokoa haholo.
We notice that this image is moving.	Re hlokomela hore setšoantšo sena se tsamaea.
This is what you love.	Sena ke seo u se ratang.
He always gave.	O ne a lula a fana.
Or just outside.	Kapa ka ntle feela.
And so on and so forth.	'Me joalo ka eona le tsohle.
No one knows your family and children as well as you.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang lelapa la hau le bana ba hau joalo ka uena.
We will not help him if we do not think it over.	Ha re na ho mo thusa haeba re sa e nahane hantle.
This is the worst.	Ena ke eona e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
This is no longer true.	Sena ha e sa le 'nete.
He will not always exist.	A ke ke a dula a le teng.
No one had ever done that before.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a etsa joalo pele.
He refuses.	O a hana.
He thought about that.	O ile a nahana ka seo.
I would have just enjoyed the phone.	Nka be ke thabetse mohala feela.
It's an easy thing to work with.	Ke ntho e bonolo ho sebetsa ka eona.
That's why we know people.	Ke kahoo re tsebang batho.
It is about thirty feet.	E ka ba maoto a mashome a mararo.
It continues from there until the fourth year.	E tsoela pele ho tloha moo ho fihlela selemong sa bone.
However, some of them.	Leha ho le joalo, ba bang ba bona.
We certainly did.	Ruri re ile ra etsa joalo.
You can never win.	Le ka mohla u ke ke ua hlola.
And we want to ask.	Mme re batla ho botsa.
I think about my feet and I can be tough again.	Ke nahana ka maoto a ka mme ke ka ba thata hape.
I am a dog.	Ke ntja.
Do what you have to do.	Etsa seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
I am not many people.	Ha ke batho ba bangata.
He fully understands how he felt.	O utloisisa hantle hore na o ne a ikutloa joang.
This is one of the few.	Ena ke e 'ngoe ea tse' maloa.
Maybe someone should do that, but you love it more than it is.	Mohlomong motho o lokela ho etsa joalo, empa uena u e rata ho feta kamoo e leng ka teng.
And boy, was it fun.	Mme moshanyana, e ne e le monate.
But that did not happen.	Empa seo ha sea ka sa etsahala.
That's the kind of things he would say.	Ke mofuta oa lintho tseo a neng a tla li bua.
Thank you for giving us your strength.	Re leboha ho re fa matla a hau.
He saw that.	O ne a bona seo.
Something strange was happening but he did not know what it was.	Ho ne ho etsahala ntho e makatsang empa a sa tsebe hore na ke eng.
He is such a wonderful person.	Ke motho ea makatsang joalo.
We were one team now, working together.	Re ne re le sehlopha se le seng hona joale, re sebetsa hammoho.
But he did not belong to it or to it.	Empa o ne a se oa eona kapa ho eona.
Her hands were crying.	Matsoho a hae a ne a lla.
Enter another room.	Kena ka kamoreng e 'ngoe.
People knew about our news.	Batho ba ile ba tseba ka litaba tsa rona.
Maybe you can expect.	Mohlomong u ka lebella.
I could not stand.	Ke ne nke ke ka ema.
Or a.	Kapa a.
That's where we are, man.	Ke hona moo re leng teng, monna.
So he was not alone.	Kahoo e ne e se eena feela.
No one knew where he was.	Ho ne ho se motho ya tsebang moo a leng teng.
The ride there was not fun.	Ho palama moo ho ne ho se monate.
Certainly not.	Ka sebele ha ba joalo.
Because there was nothing else you could do.	Hobane ho ne ho se letho le leng leo le ka le etsang.
I am not sure about this.	Ha ke na bonnete ka sena.
We know who the mother is.	Rea tseba hore na mme ke mang.
It needs a man of many years.	E hloka monna ea lilemo tse ngata.
Obviously do your best.	Ho hlakile hore etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang.
He had heard.	O ne a utloile.
Anything you can do with it.	Ke eng kapa eng eo u ka e etsang ka eona.
Some do.	Ba bang ba etsa joalo.
I went out.	Ke ile ka tsoa.
He would never use it again.	O ne a sa tlo e sebelisa hape.
He probably knew his wife better than anyone else.	Mohlomong o ne a tseba mosali oa hae ho feta motho leha e le ofe e mong.
Now you know why.	Joale ua tseba hore na ke hobane'ng.
He was the best.	O ne a le molemo ka ho fetisisa.
I felt like he was there.	Ke ne ke utloa eka o teng.
I have to always be there.	Ke tlameha ho lula ke le teng.
Nothing seemed important right now.	Ho ne ho se letho le neng le bonahala le le bohlokoa hona joale.
He was just like that.	O ne a le jwalo feela.
It does not seem so in the past.	Ha ho bonahale ho le joalo khale.
It seemed even worse to me.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le mpe ho feta moo ho nna.
However, it is the same truth.	Leha ho le joalo, ke 'nete e tšoanang.
So this is exactly what was behind it.	Kahoo sena ke sona se neng se le ka mor'a eona.
So he had to fix that.	Kahoo o ile a tlameha ho lokisa seo.
It looks like it.	E shebahala joalo ka eona.
It was hard even to look at him.	Ho ne ho le thata le ho mo sheba.
It is easy to read.	Ho bonolo ho li bala.
For some reason he could not hear them.	Ka lebaka le itseng o ne a sa khone ho li utloa.
None of them expected to see him again.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa bona ea neng a lebeletse ho mo bona hape.
He would need it when he got to the ground.	O ne a tla e hloka ha a fihla fatše.
It seemed so easy.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le bonolo haholo.
We are going home.	Re ea hae.
You're done.	O qetile.
We must not lose sight of the importance of this issue.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho lebala bohlokoa ba taba ena.
We can overcome our problems.	Re ka hlola mathata a rona.
We hope the suggestion can help you!	Re tšepa hore tlhahiso e ka u thusa!
This was a mistake.	Sena e ne e le phoso.
It was as if he wanted to be invisible.	E ne eka o batla ho se bonahale.
I ask that, too.	Ke kopa seo, le nna.
That's the way it is.	Ke kamoo ho leng kateng.
There are so many of them.	Ho na le tse ngata haholo tsa tsona.
He spends all his time studying.	O qeta nako eohle ea hae a ithuta.
They couldn't find it.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba e fumana.
But it is not good.	Empa ha e ntle.
I took mine and left.	Ke ile ka nka ea ka eaba kea tsamaea.
Very good for you !!.	E ntle haholo ho uena !!.
First, a.	Ea pele, a.
She feels happy.	O ikutloa a thabile.
All but one.	Tsohle ntle le a le mong.
I try to sleep.	Ke leka ho robala.
I knew there was one.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ho na le e 'ngoe.
And good enough.	Mme e ntle ho lekana.
Don't make me say anything again.	O seke wa etsa hore ke bue letho hape.
What they said.	Seo ba neng ba se bua.
He considered the proposal carefully before refusing.	O ile a nahana ka tlhahiso eo ka hloko pele a hana.
I think people have never thought of that.	Ke nahana hore batho ha ba so ka ba nahana ka seo.
You obviously do not want to live.	Ho hlakile hore ha u batle ho phela.
Another teacher goes to school.	Tichere e ’ngoe e kena sekolo.
All he knew was that he had to talk to her.	Seo a neng a se tseba feela ke hore o tlameha ho bua le eena.
A man and a woman have been arrested.	Monna le mosali ba tšoeroe.
I try to think of something else.	Ke leka ho nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Only you can decide for yourself what you can do.	Ke uena feela ea ka etsang qeto ea hore na ke ntho eo u ka e khonang.
It keeps me writing.	E etsa hore ke lule ke ngola.
I was very tired.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo.
In fact, they did nothing about us.	Ha e le hantle, ha baa ka ba etsa letho ka rona.
Because I love them more than you know.	Hobane kea ba rata ho feta kamoo u tsebang.
I can no longer sleep.	Ha ke sa khona ho robala.
If you really want to, you will.	Haeba u hlile u batla, u tla etsa joalo.
And good money.	Le chelete e ntle.
The party was very fun.	Mokete oo o ne o le monate haholo.
People are asking for this.	Batho ba kopa sena.
As of now, here you are.	Joalo ka hona joale, mona le uena.
I thought we did a really good job.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re entse mosebetsi o motle haholo.
Now it was her turn.	Joale e ne e le nako ea hae.
There will be no more.	Ha ho sa tla ba teng.
I think he's leaving.	Ke nahana hore oa tsamaea.
Then go to bed, too.	Ebe u ea robala, hape.
It's a wonderful feeling.	Ke maikutlo a monate.
I want you to think about her.	Ke batla hore o nahane ka tsa hae.
I'll be back in a few hours.	Ke tla khutla ka mor'a lihora tse 'maloa.
Such a thing could happen.	Ntho e joalo e ka etsahala.
So for him, there was no question.	Kahoo ho eena, ho ne ho se na potso.
We could do a lot of things, if we had a lot of money.	Re ne re ka etsa lintho tse ngata, haeba re ne re e-na le chelete e ngata.
It would be nice to have a dog.	Ho ka be ho bile monate ho ba le ntja.
I live nearby.	Ke lula haufi.
He calls.	O letsa.
And that way.	Mme ka tsela eo.
I read it and looked at it.	Ke ile ka e bala ’me ka e sheba.
Only I can do it.	Ke 'na feela ea ka e etsang.
It went on after that.	E ile ea tsoela pele ka mor'a moo.
He entered.	A kena.
When we sleep we do not eat.	Ha re robala ha re je.
They are still very simple.	Li ntse li le bonolo haholo.
There was a wet spot on the floor.	Ho ne ho e-na le sebaka se metsi fatše.
Maybe he was in everyone.	Mohlomong o ne a le ho bohle.
And in the sun.	Le ka letsatsi.
It's hard to talk about it.	Ho thata ho bua ka eona.
So, get out.	Kahoo, tsoa.
I come here to work.	Ke tla mona ke sebetsa.
I will always be there.	Ke tla lula ke ntse ke le teng.
Look at the real problem.	Sheba bothata ba sebele.
She wanted to see her son before he died.	O ne a batla ho bona mora oa hae pele a hlokahala.
On one occasion he asked her about them.	Ka lekhetlo le leng a mo botsa ka tsona.
He looked closely.	A sheba haufi.
It can't be any better.	Ho ka se be betere ho hang.
Maybe this could happen.	Mohlomong sena se ka etsahala.
Many people have done it before you.	Batho ba bangata ba e entse pele ho uena.
That and that there was someone with me.	Hore le hore ho ne ho e-na le motho ea nang le 'na.
Such a long way to fall.	Tsela e telele hakana ya ho wa.
He looked bigger than ever.	O ne a shebahala a le moholo ho feta kamehla.
I'll get a car and get us breakfast.	Ke tla fumana koloi ke re fumane lijo tsa hoseng.
Because it is my state of mind.	Ke hobane ke boemo ba ka ba kelello.
They never told me anything about it.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba mpolella letho ka eona.
You have to work with everyone.	U tlameha ho sebetsa le bohle.
You have to get out.	U tlameha ho tsoa.
But some may need to write.	Empa ba bang ba ka ’na ba hloka ho ngola.
But that is not the case.	Empa le ka mohla ha ho joalo.
We were all children of the same parents.	Kaofela re ne re le bana ba batsoali ba tšoanang.
I think they made a mistake.	Ke nahana hore ba entse phoso.
Something happened.	Ho na le ntho e etsahetseng.
He knew nothing.	O ne a sa tsebe letho.
I really like it.	Ke e rata haholo.
I would have to go.	Ke ne ke tla tlameha ho tsamaea.
Or whatever you can think of.	Kapa eng kapa eng eo u ka e nahanang.
We will get there.	Re tla fihla teng.
He is shy and retired.	O lihlong 'me o tlohela mosebetsi.
I knew it wasn't really my business.	Ke ne ke tseba hore e ne e hlile e se taba ea ka.
She wanted her husband.	O ne a batla monna wa hae.
However, it often means that they will continue.	Leha ho le joalo, hangata ho bolela hore ba tla tsoela pele.
This works well.	Sena se sebetsa hantle.
That's just the picture, the picture.	Setšoantšo ke seo feela, setšoantšo.
Most parents love their children and are happy to have them.	Batsoali ba bangata ba rata bana ba bona ’me ba thabela hore ebe ba bile le bona.
That means it is not enough food.	Seo se bolela hore ha se lijo tse lekaneng.
Something told me he was in it.	Ntho e 'ngoe e ile ea mpolella hore o ne a le ho eona.
To get it all at once.	Ea ho fumana tsohle hang hang.
It was better for him to go.	Ho ne ho le molemo hore a tsamaee.
And what one needs.	Le seo motho a se hlokang.
It's none of our business.	Ha se taba ea rona.
Something similar is needed now.	Ntho e tšoanang le eo ea hlokahala hona joale hape.
He was a strange man.	E ne e le monna ya makatsang.
None of this would go well.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsena e neng e tla tsamaea hantle.
Everything seems to be going well.	Lintho tsohle li bonahala li tsamaea hantle.
You must have done this before.	E tlameha ebe o ile oa etsa sena pele.
We will continue.	Re tla tsoela pele.
Moreover, as such, so many issues.	Ho feta moo, joalo ka, litaba tse ngata haholo.
I am very busy today.	Ke phathahane haholo kajeno.
That issue is not very important.	Taba eo ha e bohlokoa haholo.
I don’t think we spent the night there.	Ha ke nahane hore re ile ra qeta bosiu moo.
He told me.	O ile a mpolella .
But the danger remains.	Empa kotsi e ntse e le teng.
He looks around but sees nothing.	O sheba, ha a bone letho.
That will be one of my favorites.	Tseo e tla ba tse ling tsa tseo ke li ratang.
Knowing who he is now.	Ho tseba hore na ke mang hona joale.
The same is true of a doctor.	Ho joalo le ka ngaka.
It would come out right.	E ne e tla tsoa hantle.
Before that they were not there.	Pele ho moo ha ba eo.
I start riding again.	Ke qala ho palama hape.
This is not the case.	Sena ha se ntho e joalo.
I had just started.	Ke ne ke sa tsoa qala.
I was still hearing things.	Ke ne ke ntse ke utloa lintho.
This is family life.	Bona ke bophelo ba lelapa.
Now it is a real thing.	Hona joale ke ntho ea sebele.
I mean when you talk about.	Ke bolela ha u bua ka .
Trying to know.	Ho leka ho tseba.
I'm sorry about this.	Ke masoabi ka sena.
However, none of that happened.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tseo e ileng ea etsahala.
To do whatever they want.	Ho etsa eng kapa eng eo ba e batlang.
I want you to think about it.	Ke batla hore u nahane ka eona.
He has a dog.	O na le ntja.
That's not what he does.	Ha se seo a se etsang.
However, you have no chance.	Leha ho le joalo, ha u na monyetla.
He knew he had to go.	O ne a tseba hore o tlameha ho tsamaea.
It starts right here.	E qala hona mona.
They said they did not have it.	Ba itse ha ba na eona.
I want more.	Ke batla tse ling.
We will do our best.	Re tla etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
However, this seems to be even more difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se bonahala se le thata le ho feta.
Nothing would happen to him or anyone else.	Ho ne ho se letho le neng le tla etsahala ho eena kapa ho e mong.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
The same people are coming back.	Batho ba tšoanang ba ntse ba khutla.
I was not sure who to talk to before.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ke bue le mang pele.
The same is true in another way.	Ho joalo le ka tsela e 'ngoe.
The search method is required.	Ho hlokahala mokhoa oa ho batla.
Then he let us in.	Eaba o re lumella ho kena.
We have to do this every morning !.	Re tlameha ho etsa sena hoseng ho hong le ho hong!.
Finally, he was able to sleep.	Qetellong, o ile a khona ho robala.
The boy is not the same today.	Moshanyana ha se eena kajeno.
That's great.	Ke hantle haholo.
We do nothing to help our situation.	Ha re etse letho ho thusa boemo ba rona.
Then we stopped and walked for a while.	Eaba rea ​​ema ’me ra tsamaea ho se hokae.
Coming back, who knows how long it can take.	Ho khutla, ke mang ea tsebang hore na ho ka nka nako e kae.
Maybe you can help us.	Mohlomong u ka re thusa.
They keep the mistake.	Ba boloka phoso.
But we love that approach.	Empa re rata mokhoa oo.
But he would say that.	Empa o ne a tla e bua joalo.
There is no way to know anything right now.	Ha ho mokhoa oa ho tseba letho hona joale.
But he wants food.	Empa o batla lijo.
Matter is equal to power.	Taba e lekana le matla.
They have had many.	Ba bile le tse ngata.
Also, some delicious food!	Hape, lijo tse ling tse monate!
Time and again, she made him love her.	Nako le nako, o ne a etsa hore a mo rate.
Many people were just beginning to see it.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba qala ho e bona.
I know it did.	Kea tseba e entse joalo.
Please buy his book.	Ka kopo, reka buka ea hae.
My father, as he walked away, said a little.	Ntate, ha a ntse a tsamaea, a bua hanyane.
It takes a picture of itself.	E nka setšoantšo sa eona.
You know there is a chance you won't come back.	Ua tseba hore ho na le monyetla oa hore u se ke ua khutla.
But he said nothing.	Empa ha a ka a bua letho.
Do you expect us to believe that?	Na o lebeletse hore re lumele seo?
Once you see it, of course.	Hang ha u e bona, ho hlakile.
It was my job.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa ka.
The most important thing you can do.	Ntho ea bohlokoa eo u ka e etsang.
But try hard.	Empa leka hantle.
This would not have happened.	Sena se ka be se sa etsahala.
I need to talk to him.	Ke hloka ho bua le eena.
You need to know everything.	O hloka ho tseba tsohle.
I had to do this alone.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho etsa sena ke le mong.
If that were the case, everyone would do it.	Haeba ho ne ho le jwalo, bohle ba ka be ba e etsa.
I do not want your regrets.	Ha ke batle masoabi a hau.
He had to make a decision.	O ne a lokela ho etsa qeto.
He knew he had to do something.	O ne a tseba hore o lokela ho etsa ho hong.
When he spoke, we understood that he was one of them.	Ha a bua, re ile ra utloisisa hore ke e mong oa bona.
I was not sure.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle.
Somehow it is.	Ka tsela e itseng ho joalo.
There was still a chance.	Ho ne ho ntse ho e-na le monyetla.
We will ask for it.	Re tla e kopa.
She can have as many children as she wants.	A ka ba le bana ba bangata kamoo a ratang kateng.
Even his mother could not help him.	Le ’mè oa hae o ne a ke ke a mo thusa.
I finally called the helpline.	Qetellong ke ile ka letsetsa mohala oa thuso.
Very, very little.	Haholo, hanyane haholo.
That's the only way.	Ke eona feela tsela eo.
The only way to get around is to move on.	Tsela feela ea ho feta ke ho ea pele.
You seemed happy.	U ne u bonahala u thabile.
There is work.	Ho na le mosebetsi.
She seemed to be wondering how much she would tell me.	Ho ne ho bonahala a ipotsa hore na o tla mpolella lintho tse kae.
It was tomorrow.	E ne e le hosane.
I would like to know if it was so or not.	Ke kopa ho tseba hore na ho ne ho le joalo kapa che.
For Mom, it is not.	Bakeng sa 'Mè, ha ho joalo.
Everyone knows that, but it can work.	E mong le e mong oa tseba seo, empa se ka sebetsa.
But they are not the only ones.	Empa hase bona feela.
More than you are.	Ho feta moo o leng teng.
Or eat it.	Kapa mo je.
Does anyone have an idea of ​​what is going on.	Na ho na le motho ea nang le mohopolo oa se etsahalang.
Only when necessary.	Feela ha ho hlokahala.
I can imagine.	Nka nahana.
We ask, they do.	Re a botsa, ba etsa joalo.
Some never do that.	Ba bang ha ho mohla ba etsang joalo.
He did not come to me.	Ha a ka a tla ho nna.
And it had a way.	Mme e ne e na le tsela.
I've never seen this before.	Ha ke eso bone sena pele.
Finding him will not be a problem.	Ho mo fumana e ke ke ea e-ba bothata.
I think you even told him about it.	Ke nahana hore u bile u mo boleletse ka eona.
We want to predict.	Re batla ho bolela esale pele.
But you should expect that.	Empa o lokela ho lebella seo.
How can we stay idle.	Re ka lula joang re sa etse letho.
We provide food for the dog.	Re fana ka lijo bakeng sa ntja.
I just loved working with him.	Ke ne ke rata ho sebetsa le eena feela.
It was our fault.	E ne e le molato oa rōna.
You did not tell them.	Ha ua ka ua ba bolella eona.
I knew exactly what my mother would think.	Ke ne ke tseba hantle hore na ’Mè o ne a tla nahana eng.
I don't make much money.	Ha ke etse chelete e ngata.
There was no need to say anything.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale ho bua letho.
This works now.	Sena se sebetsa hona joale.
We'll just see what happens.	Re tla bona feela se etsahalang.
He refused to go in.	A hana ho kena.
He passed.	O ile a feta.
It is not a matter of standing.	Ha se taba ea ho ema.
You will get what you need.	U tla fumana seo u se hlokang.
Some of them tried.	Ba bang ba bona ba ile ba leka.
I'm leaving now.	Kea tsamaea joale.
I think this is just fine.	Ke nahana hore sena se setle feela.
One can never think of a woman.	Ha ho mohla motho a ka nahanang hore ke mosali.
I asked him what he wanted.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na o batla eng.
Now we know why.	Joale re tseba lebaka.
It could have been.	Ho ka be ho bile teng.
Old car.	Koloi ea khale.
They have finished reading.	Ba se ba qetile ho bala.
These people were with him.	Batho bana ba ne ba e-na le eena.
You can have children.	U ka ba le bana.
It was close.	E ne e le haufi.
You need to work hard.	U hloka ho sebetsa ka matla.
I will have to find a way to thank him.	Ke tla tlameha ho fumana mokhoa oa ho mo leboha.
He would have just met her.	O ne a tla be a sa tsoa kopana le eena.
I always take three at a time.	Kamehla ke li nka tse tharo ka nako.
I love your idea more.	Ke rata mohopolo oa hau ho feta.
Or drive where we want.	Kapa khanna moo re batlang.
True, if we were to eat him.	Ke 'nete, haeba re ne re tla mo ja.
I also do not know why he did so.	Le 'na ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a entse joalo.
We do our best.	Re etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
He had never been so lonely.	O ne a e-s'o ka a lula a se na batho hakaalo.
It does not need anything.	Ha e hloke letho.
But the only thing we can do is do our best.	Empa ntho feela eo re ka e etsang ke ho etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
Just that it's dangerous.	Feela hore ho kotsi.
The team was important.	Sehlopha se ne se le bohlokoa.
Watching it is bad enough.	Ho e shebella ho mpe ho lekana.
I really like to see that.	Ke hlile ke rata ho bona seo.
Money was coming to me every day, but it was useless.	Chelete e ne e tla ho ’na letsatsi le leng le le leng, empa e ne e se na molemo.
So they say.	Kahoo ba re.
It does not appear today.	Ha e bonahale kajeno.
We have seen that.	Re bone hore .
The house looks very nice.	Ntlo e shebahala e le ntle haholo.
The house is still there today.	Ntlo e ntse e le teng le kajeno.
It is my favorite restaurant!	Ke ntlo ea lijo eo ke e ratang haholo!
However, it could have been worse.	Leha ho le joalo, e ka be e bile mpe le ho feta.
The second group is simple.	Sehlopha sa bobeli se bonolo.
Now that is gone.	Jwale seo se ile.
Guilty of doing nothing.	Molato ka ho se etse letho.
That was his first and last mistake.	Eo e ne e le phoso ea hae ea pele le ea ho qetela.
I love the simple task of ‘getting in and doing it.	Ke rata mosebetsi o bonolo oa 'kena' me u e etse.
Something is wrong here.	Ho na le phoso mona.
Because, we don't know how to do that.	Hobane, ha re tsebe ho etsa hoo.
Maybe that's why he came back.	Mohlomong ke ka lebaka leo a ileng a khutla.
That would be fine, maybe not.	Hoo ho ka ba hantle, mohlomong ha ho joalo.
He has power.	O na le matla.
That was not the first thing he said to her.	Eo e ne e se ntho ea pele eo a ileng a e bua ho eena.
This is the first problem.	Bona ke bothata ba pele.
Do something else.	Etsa ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I can't thank you enough.	Ha ke khone ho u leboha ka ho lekaneng.
To his home, that is.	Ho ea hae, ke hore.
They are not there now.	Ha ba eo hona joale.
My mother did not tell me that.	'Mè ha aa ka a mpolella seo.
I tell you.	Kea u bolella.
And this place is equally important.	Mme sebaka sena se bohlokoa ho lekana.
When it came time to read their comments, they did not want to.	Ha ho fihla nako ea ho bala maikutlo a bona, ba ne ba sa batle.
However, it was somewhat difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho batla ho le thata.
Life is more important than ever.	Bophelo ke ba bohlokoa ho feta.
I continued reading.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele ho bala.
There is a party.	Ho na le mokete.
Yes, there was something similar.	E, ho ne ho e-na le seo se tšoanang.
They were really close to me.	Ba ne ba hlile ba le haufi le nna.
I will never make that mistake again.	Ha ke sa tla etsa phoso eo hape.
Or maybe not everyone knows that.	Kapa mohlomong bohle ha ba tsebe seo.
What can happen.	Seo se ka etsahalang.
If news needs to find my way, so be it.	Haeba litaba li hloka ho fumana tsela ea ka, ho joalo.
So, what are we doing now?	Joale, re etsa’ng hona joale?
And she is always beautiful.	Mme o dula a le motle.
I would give it a go.	Ke ne ke tla fana ka eona.
This was not my idea.	Ena e ne e se mohopolo oa ka.
Then come back again.	Ebe u khutlela hape.
They will have more.	Ba tla ba le ho feta.
Everyone knows everything.	E mong le e mong o tseba tsohle.
They enjoyed him as a person.	Ba ne ba mo thabetse e le motho.
Always do your best.	Kamehla etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang.
That is what makes us exist.	Ke tsona tse etsang hore re be teng.
Many people found the task difficult.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba fumana mosebetsi oo o le boima.
None of this is true.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona eo e leng 'nete ka eona.
We have real power and we know it.	Re na le matla a sebele ’me rea a tseba.
I'm not sure where the other one went.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na e mong o ile kae.
You can't try to keep everyone happy.	U ke ke ua leka ho boloka bohle ba thabile.
Clearly, this is becoming more and more important over the years.	Ho hlakile hore sena se ntse se e-ba bohlokoa haholoanyane ka lilemo.
And why not.	Mme hobaneng ho se joalo.
However, it does not matter because he will be there tonight, too.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho na taba hobane o tla ba teng bosiung bona, le eena.
What happened once would happen again.	Se etsahetseng hang se ne se tla etsahala hape.
If he comes out.	Haeba a tsoa.
We do not talk together at once.	Ha re bue hammoho hang.
So, what are we going to do with it?	Joale, re tla etsa joang ka eona?
Of course he would.	Ehlile o ne a tla etsa joalo.
Because these people know better.	Hobane batho bana ba tseba ho feta.
First, you need to get one.	Pele, u lokela ho fumana e 'ngoe.
It was a wonderful day.	E bile letsatsi le monate.
There is nothing left.	Ha ho sa na letho.
I love each and every one of them very much.	Ke rata e mong le e mong oa bona haholo.
I haven't done that yet.	Ha ke eso etse seo le jwale.
They don’t like what you do to them.	Ha ba rate seo o se etsang ho bona.
Look, just forget it.	Sheba, lebala feela.
It's just me.	Ke 'na feela.
Except for today.	Ntle le kajeno.
You should definitely try.	Ka sebele u lokela ho leka.
You feel good.	U ikutloa hantle.
They kept him but it was a job.	Ba ile ba mo boloka empa e ne e le mosebetsi.
You can hear yours now.	U ka utloa ea hau hona joale.
Call now to make it your own !!!.	Letsetsa hona joale ho e etsa ea hau !!!.
We could not.	Re ne re ka se khone.
He was an only child.	E ne e le ngoana a le mong.
It was just a matter of time.	E ne e le nako feela.
I'm not sure what else I can say about him.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka bua eng hape ka eena.
Maybe you will.	Mohlomong u tla ba joalo.
Deciding what you want to do and do it.	Ho etsa qeto ea seo u batlang ho se etsa le ho se etsa.
Why he didn't say anything, he wondered.	Hobaneng a sa bue letho, a ipotsa.
But, that was not the question.	Mme, e ne e se potso.
We are still emotional.	Re ntse re e-na le maikutlo.
I just looked at him.	Ke ile ka mo sheba feela.
I felt like a child again.	Ke ile ka ikutloa joaloka ngoana hape.
And it looks like a party for a party.	'Me ho bonahala e le mokete bakeng sa mokete.
Very strong, very strong.	E matla haholo, haholo.
It does not take long.	E se ke ea nka nako e telele.
I love you more than life.	Ke o rata ho feta bophelo.
Go ahead.	Tsoela pele.
She stopped and cried.	O ile a ema eaba o lla.
You take one for a group.	U nka e 'ngoe bakeng sa sehlopha.
We can go in the morning.	Re ka tsamaea hoseng.
He never did.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo.
It was great to see it.	Ho bile monate ho o bona.
He looks great.	O shebahala a le moholo.
If it works, fine.	Haeba e sebetsa, hantle.
Everyone wants to get better.	E mong le e mong o batla ho etsa betere.
I think there are good things.	Ke nahana hore ho na le lintho tse ntle.
You think that it is easy, but it takes years to master it.	U nahana hore ho bonolo, empa ho nka lilemo ho tseba hantle.
It's heavy.	E boima.
He was a very tough man.	E ne e le monna ya thata haholo.
I know better now.	Ke tseba betere hona joale.
I thought it was fun !.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e monate!.
As we know now, it is not.	Joalo ka ha re tseba joale, ha ho joalo.
This time is your life.	Nako ena ke bophelo ba hau.
You do your best.	U etsa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Neither do you.	Le uena ha u etse joalo.
But this would take time.	Empa sena se ne se tla nka nako.
It is useless to try to go back to sleep now.	Ha ho na thuso ho leka ho khutlela ho robala hona joale.
She is very sweet.	O monate haholo.
People do not care so much.	Batho ha ba tsotelle hakaalo.
He has done everything hard.	O entse tsohle ka thata.
I love what you do.	Ke rata seo o se etsang.
Say no.	U re che.
Do not be afraid to try them before you move on.	U se ke ua tšaba ho li leka pele u tsoela pele.
I never thought about that before.	Ha ke eso nahane ka seo pele.
I do not know where they went.	Ha ke tsebe moo ba ileng teng.
And we paid.	Mme re ile ra lefa.
It could have been anything or anyone.	E ka be e bile eng kapa eng kapa mang kapa mang.
You are needed.	Ua hlokahala.
Start your own group.	Qala sehlopha sa hau.
John works hard as a doctor.	John o sebetsa ka thata e le ngaka.
That would not be good.	Hoo ho ka se be molemo.
But that is not the whole picture.	Empa ha se setšoantšo sohle.
As we did.	Joalo ka ha re entse.
Look, it's just hard.	Sheba, ho thata feela.
You can have something else if you like.	U ka ba le ntho e 'ngoe haeba u rata.
Now, if that's what you want to say, all right.	Jwale, haeba ke seo o batlang ho se bua, hantle.
It is the last day of school.	Ke letsatsi la ho qetela la sekolo.
You drink it.	U e noa.
I say no, you don't.	Ke re che, ha u etse joalo.
It doesn't matter what you think.	Ha ho na taba hore na o nahana eng.
But the real ones do.	Empa ba ’nete ba etsa joalo.
I can no longer stand.	Ha ke sa khona ho ema.
Maybe we'd like to talk about it.	Mohlomong re rata ho bua ka eona.
To many it was just too much.	Ho ba bangata e ne e mpa e le ngata haholo.
I heard.	Ke utloile.
He is alive now.	O a phela jwale.
He had a chance.	O bile le monyetla.
That I did not know at all.	Seo ke ne ke sa se tsebe ho hang.
He just wanted to enjoy it.	O ne a mpa a batla ho e thabela feela.
It was so much fun.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo.
I'll take this.	Ke tla e thabela.
She did not know who the man was.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na monna eo ke mang.
I want to keep looking at it.	Ke batla ho dula ke e sheba.
If he still believes, beware.	Haeba a ntse a lumela, hlokomela.
You will not be able to imagine the situation.	U ke ke ua khona ho nahana hore na boemo bo joang.
I wanted both of them.	Ke ne ke li batla ka bobeli.
We get into them.	Re kena ka tsona.
But that is not what it was.	Empa ha se seo e neng e le sona.
People must hear it.	Batho ba tlameha ho e utloa.
He said he loved her very much.	O ile a bolela hore o mo rata haholo.
You are strong, you.	O matla, wena.
If you can not find a.	Haeba u sa khone ho fumana a.
Her father too.	Ntate oa hae le eena.
One time I even had the opportunity to ask her why.	Ka lekhetlo le leng ke ile ka fumana monyetla oa ho mo botsa hore na ke hobane’ng.
I think you can't do that.	Ke nahana hore o ka se etse seo.
He walked until late at night.	A tsamaea ho fihlela bosiu.
He had just finished talking to me.	O ne a qetile ho bua le nna.
Live in the present.	Phela nakong ya jwale.
There was no danger of telling him now.	Ho ne ho se kotsi ea ho mo bolella hona joale.
He did not understand the question.	O ne a sa utloisise potso eo.
The first is space.	Ea pele ke sebaka.
They are difficult.	Li thata.
Too many people.	Batho ba bangata haholo.
There was no one, as far as he knew.	Ho ne ho se motho, ho ya kamoo a neng a tseba kateng.
But it will not last long.	Empa e ke ke ea phela nako e telele.
That doesn't matter now.	Seo ha se na taba hona joale.
No one has ever seen it.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a e bona.
I have to go now.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea hona joale.
You may have seen such things.	E ka ’na eaba u kile ua bona tse joalo.
There was only water now.	Ho ne ho na le metsi feela jwale.
I grabbed some of the.	Ke ile ka tšoara tse ling tsa.
He drinks water every morning.	O noa metsi hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
Probably too much.	Mohlomong e ngata haholo.
I will do it again.	Ke tla e etsa hape.
Make sure you stay close to me as soon as we enter.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u lula haufi le 'na hang ha re kena.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
I have no idea.	Ha ke tsebe letho.
That makes it even harder.	Seo se etsa hore ho be thata haholoanyane.
I knew from then on we would have a problem.	Ke ne ke tseba ho tloha moo re tla ba le bothata.
And he fell in love with her.	Mme a mo rata.
There were many of them.	Ho ne ho e-na le ba bangata ba bona.
These are the best.	Tsena ke tse ntle ka ho fetisisa.
We can be much better off without it.	Re ka ba betere haholo ntle le eona.
He liked what the doctor said.	O ne a rata seo ngaka e se buang.
He will return home next week.	O tla khutlela hae bekeng e tlang.
Obviously, it would not eat either.	Ho hlakile hore le eona e ne e ke ke ea ja.
I need to get out of here.	Ke hloka ho tsoa mona.
He didn't even look at her.	Ha a ka a mo sheba le ho mo sheba.
It is necessary.	Hoa hlokahala.
Just find out.	Fumana feela.
He loves to take care of others.	O rata ho hlokomela ba bang.
It would have been fun.	Ho ka be ho bile monate.
I doubt that will happen.	Ke belaela hore seo se tla etsahala.
They are my friends.	Ke metsoalle ea ka.
We are not sure what we think of that.	Ha re na bonnete ba hore na re nahana eng ka seo.
Or he knew her.	Kapa o ne a mo tseba.
I don't believe we do it because it's easy.	Ha ke lumele hore re e etsa hobane e bonolo.
I went with my mother and a few other people.	Ke ile ka tsamaea le 'Mè le batho ba bang ba' maloa.
I made your dinner.	Ke entse lijo tsa hau tsa mantsiboea.
My father was one of them.	Ntate e ne e le e mong oa bona.
We are leaving.	Rea tsamaea.
He saw the danger.	O ile a bona kotsi.
That he had enough money so he did not need to work.	Hore o ne a e-na le chelete e lekaneng kahoo o ne a sa hloke ho sebetsa.
And it really is.	Mme ehlile ho jwalo.
They were too many.	Li ne li le ngata haholo.
I am sure you will read very well.	Ke bonnete ba hore o tla bala hantle haholo.
Then why is the question.	Joale ke hobane'ng ha e le potso.
Of course, it was empty.	Ehlile, e ne e se na letho.
He gave the dog a treat.	O ile a fa ntja monate.
They must continue with their work.	Ba tlameha ho tsoela pele ka mosebetsi oa bona.
She is good with her hands.	O molemo ka matsoho a hae.
But that is not at all what it is.	Empa ho hang ha se kamoo ho leng kateng.
He knows nothing about anything.	Ha a tsebe letho ka letho.
What we did.	Seo re se entseng.
Try to feel good about the whole thing.	Leka ho ikutloa hantle ka taba eohle.
Every man loved it.	Monna e mong le e mong o ne a rata.
That is what makes us strong.	Ke sona se etsang hore re be matla.
A man who does work.	Monna ea etsang mosebetsi.
From this time.	Ho tloha nakong ena.
It was very clear what they were trying to do.	Ho ne ho hlakile haholo seo ba neng ba leka ho se etsa.
You need to know how to read each other.	U lokela ho tseba ho bala e mong ho e mong.
It is something that is already happening.	Ke ntho e seng e ntse e etsahala.
But it seems to be a difficult thing to do.	Empa ho bonahala e le ntho e thata ho e etsa.
That goes first.	Seo se ya pele.
I know we have a lot going on.	Kea tseba hore re na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang.
You just have no power.	Ha u na matla feela.
They may want it for its concept.	Ba ka 'na ba e batla bakeng sa maikutlo a eona.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
But it was so clear, no one could want it.	Empa e ne e hlakile haholo, ho ne ho se motho ea ka e batlang.
And in the morning they went.	'Me hoseng ba tsamaea.
I go to school.	Ke kena sekolo.
He loved to talk.	O ne a rata ho bua.
In good times, and bad.	Ka linako tse monate, le tse mpe.
I have no other choice for it.	Ha ke na thuso e 'ngoe bakeng sa eona.
If you keep working it is because you love your job.	Haeba u tsoela pele ho sebetsa ke hobane u rata mosebetsi oa hau.
I'm not sure why.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na hobaneng.
No, even more so now.	Che, le ho feta hona joale.
We need to do something.	Re hloka ho etsa ho hong.
But first.	Empa pele.
Not only is it useless, but it is probably dangerous.	Hase feela hore ha ho na thuso, empa mohlomong ho kotsi.
To know more, look here.	Ho tseba haholoanyane, sheba mona.
I could not sleep.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho robala.
It is a beautiful old house.	Ke ntlo e ntle ea khale.
That's just what he is.	Ke seo a leng sona feela.
He slept all night to finish work.	O ile a robala bosiu bohle ho qeta mosebetsi.
I like to save money now.	Ke rata ho boloka chelete hona joale.
No, don't look any further.	Che, u se ke ua hlola u sheba.
Then he would sleep in it.	Joale o ne a tla robala ho eona.
It is very difficult.	Ho thata haholo.
Or in the past.	Kapa nakong e fetileng.
For so long.	Nako e telele hakana.
This picture is of my house.	Setšoantšo sena ke sa ntlo ea ka.
He had the opportunity to plan.	O ne a e-na le monyetla oa ho rera.
He could not take more than this.	O ne a sa khone ho nka ho feta mona.
Arrive early.	Fihla kapele.
Sometimes it means there is no certainty.	Ka linako tse ling ho bolela hore ha ho na bonnete.
There was no time to eat.	Ho ne ho se nako ea ho ja.
He never mentioned the matter again.	Ha a ka a hlola a bua ka taba eo.
Just that it was a bad time for me.	Feela hore e ne e le nako e mpe ho 'na.
I just finished the first one.	Ke sa tsoa qeta ea pele.
Think about the time he will have.	Nahana ka nako eo a tla ba le eona.
They would be talking about it for years to come.	Ba ne ba tla be ba ntse ba bua ka eona ka lilemo tse ngata tse tlang.
It plays again.	E bapala hape.
Ea.	Ea.
My mother.	'Mè oa ka.
Whoever felt that way outside of it.	Ke mang ea ileng a ikutloa joalo ka ntle ho eona.
He could have thought more of it.	A ka be a ile a nahana haholoanyane ka eona.
I can't stand it !.	Ke sitoa ho ema!.
But it seems he is finally coming.	Empa ho bonahala eka qetellong o tla.
We have to decide what to do with him.	Re tlameha ho etsa qeto ea hore na re etse eng ka eena.
He is playing.	O ntse a bapala.
It is not my good job to say a little.	Ha se mosebetsi oa ka o motle oa ho bua hanyane.
Some received only school uniforms.	Ba bang ba ile ba fumana liaparo tsa sekolo feela.
It's too early to say, I'd like to take a look again.	Ho sa le hoseng haholo ho bolela, nka rata ho sheba hape.
I'm very late for work.	Ke morao haholo mosebetsing.
A man may or may not understand.	Monna a ka 'na a utloisisa kapa a se ke a utloisisa.
They first met during high school.	Ba ile ba qala ho kopana nakong ea sekolo se phahameng.
We get nothing.	Ha re fumane letho.
They were always on the move.	Li ne li lula li tsamaea.
Also, thank you.	Hape, kea leboha.
They have no reason to.	Ha ba na lebaka la ho.
No one expected it.	Ha ho motho ea neng a e lebeletse.
Both of these were incredibly amazing.	Tsena ka bobeli e ne e le ntho e makatsang e makatsang.
But you would not have met him.	Empa u ka be u sa kopana le eena.
They played him one way after another.	Ba ile ba mo bapala ka mokhoa o mong ka mor'a o mong.
You can come here.	O ka tla mona.
He knew it would be hard for him to do this.	O ne a tseba hore ho tla ba thata ho eena ho etsa sena.
It's just school.	Ke sekolo feela.
Let them say so, though.	Ba bue joalo, leha ho le joalo.
His diet helped improve his condition.	Lijo tsa hae li ile tsa thusa boemo ba hae.
You should be able to try anything you want.	U lokela ho khona ho leka eng kapa eng eo u e batlang.
You need help with this.	U hloka thuso ka sena.
But that is not possible.	Empa hase ntho e ka etsahalang.
These were the things he knew.	Tsena e ne e le lintho tseo a neng a li tseba.
He just stared.	O ile a sheba feela.
They were really tough.	Li ne li hlile li le thata.
No, nothing.	Che, ha ho letho.
It was visible again.	Ho ne ho bonahala hape.
But after many years, he returned to his job.	Empa ka mor’a lilemo tse ngata, o ile a khutlela mosebetsing oa hae.
They will be easy.	Li tla ba bonolo.
He had to get out.	O ile a tlameha ho tsoa.
I had to sit there and stand.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho lula moo ebe ke ema.
We have seen them before they see us.	Re ba bone pele ba re bona.
I thought there was no way we could be together.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ha ho kamoo re ka bang hammoho kateng.
I know, because they were there, too.	Ke a tseba, hobane ba ne ba le teng, le bona.
Obviously it was not good.	Ho hlakile hore ho ne ho se molemo.
The food was delicious!	Lijo li ne li le monate!
I will not wonder.	Ha ke na ho ipotsa.
All his life.	Bophelo bohle ba hae.
We loved the house.	Re ne re rata ntlo.
We have a work to do.	Re na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa.
Not to mention the current situation.	Re sa bue ka boemo ba hona joale.
I'll call you tomorrow.	Ke tla o letsetsa hosane.
They did not know when he would return.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe hore na o tla khutla neng.
I think it's because he knows something.	Ke nahana hore ke hore o tseba ho hong.
Also, too long.	Hape, nako e telele haholo .
That would not be easy.	Hoo ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
I was sure you would see it my way.	Ke ne ke na le bonnete ba hore u tla bona ka tsela ea ka.
It's no use.	Ha ho na thuso.
I don't know if that is important to you.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hoo ho bohlokoa ho uena.
And it is a very difficult thing to do.	'Me ke ntho e thata haholo ho e etsa.
He had never seen it at all.	O ne a eso e bone ho hang.
I have been coming here for years.	Ke na le lilemo ke tla mona.
But he said nothing to anyone.	Empa ha a ka a bolella motho letho.
We've made it possible for you to log in on your own.	Re entse hore u khone ho kena u le mong.
She has easy hands to finish close.	O na le matsoho a bonolo ho qeta haufi.
Betrayal is fun.	Ho eka ho monate.
At this point, nothing else matters.	Nakong ena, ha ho letho le leng la bohlokoa.
It will definitely go back.	Ka sebele e tla khutlela morao.
It had to be work, school.	E ne e lokela ho ba mosebetsi, sekolo.
But that is what happened.	Empa ha etsahala jwalo.
He just wants to talk.	O batla ho bua feela.
I want to take my wife with me.	Ke batla ho nka mosali oa ka le 'na.
A car pulled up outside.	Ho ile ha ema koloi ka ntle.
So sometimes.	Kahoo ka nako e 'ngoe.
He always says that.	O dula o bolela seo.
We can't do that.	Ha re khone ho etsa joalo.
They would still like to know where it came from.	Ba ntse ba ka rata ho tseba hore na e tsoa hokae.
But, this decision is not for us to make.	Empa, qeto ena ha se ea rona ho e etsa.
This seemed bad.	Sena se ile sa bonahala se le mpe.
It is early in the morning, so there is still time.	Ho sa le hoseng, kahoo nako e sa le teng.
No one would know that he did not take them.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tla tseba hore ha aa li nka.
It's a very important issue for me.	Ke taba ea bohlokoa hakaalo ho ’na.
That's when.	Ke nakong eo.
He did not know that he would do that.	O ne a sa tsebe hore o tla etsa hoo.
He didn't have to think too long.	O ne a sa tlameha ho nahana ka nako e telele haholo.
Life must go on.	Bophelo bo tlameha ho tsoela pele.
I need to know how he did it.	Ke hloka ho tseba hore na o e entse joang.
I will pay you.	Ke tla o lefa.
But she was healthy.	Empa o ne a phela hantle.
It is a wonderful place to live.	Ke sebaka se monate ho phela.
I was happy to be in his team.	Ke ne ke thabetse ho ba sehlopheng sa hae.
They are powerful things.	Ke lintho tse matla.
So he had to give	Kahoo o ne a lokela ho fana
Plus, it was really fun.	Ho feta moo, e ne e le monate haholo.
So the decision was easy for us.	Kahoo qeto e ne e le bonolo ho rōna.
I have already found.	Ke se ke fumane.
Then some more.	Ebe tse ling hape.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
I want to see it as good as it can be.	Ke batla ho e bona e e-ba molemo ka ho fetisisa kamoo e ka khonang.
He decided to say so.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho bua joalo.
Something bad is going to happen.	Ho tla etsahala ntho e mpe.
I did not know what to do!	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke etse eng!
And it can be a wonderful life.	'Me e ka ba bophelo bo monate.
We know what they are like.	Re tseba kamoo ba leng kateng.
It is not easy to find something you like.	Ha ho bonolo ho fumana ntho eo u e ratang.
He then spoke of every opportunity.	Ka mor’a moo o ne a bua ka monyetla o mong le o mong.
I will do such a thing.	Ke tla etsa ntho e joalo.
I think it's fun.	Ke nahana hore ho monate.
Talk about simplicity.	Bua ka ho ba bonolo.
There is nothing wrong with trying.	Ha ho phoso ho leka.
He is the only one.	Ke eena feela.
An important thing.	Ntho ea bohlokoa.
We're glad for your little dress.	Re thabetse ho apara ha hao hanyane.
There is no point in it.	Ha ho thuso ho eona.
Here we will live all our days!	Mona re tla phela matsatsi a rōna kaofela!
I mean, hard.	Ke bolela, ka thata.
See, why not.	Bona, ke hobane'ng ha u sa .
However, this is not really the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se hlile ha se joalo.
This is the place to be.	Sena ke sebaka sa ho ba.
These things are just fun.	Lintho tsena li monate feela.
They were all arrested.	Kaofela ba ile ba tšoaroa.
Yes.	E ile.
Strange but very beautiful.	E makatsang empa e ntle haholo.
I'm worse than them.	Ke mpe ho feta bona.
But you have one last chance.	Empa o monyetla oa ho qetela.
We went out.	Re ile ra tsoa.
I like one of these.	Ke rata e 'ngoe ea ena.
Their lives were in constant danger.	Bophelo ba bona bo ne bo lula bo le kotsing.
They wanted to know who was to blame.	Ba ne ba batla ho tseba hore na molato ke mang.
He still lives there.	O ntse a phela moo.
We just work hard.	Re mpa re sebetsa ka thata.
Just look what he has to say.	Bona feela seo a tla se bua.
I use one of them instead of some water.	Ke sebelisa e 'ngoe ea eona sebakeng sa metsi a mang.
And now it was your turn.	Mme jwale e ne e le nako ya hao.
Probably to many of them.	Mohlomong ho ba bangata ba bona.
We did it together and it was fun.	Re e entse hammoho 'me ho ne ho le monate.
There is nothing old here.	Ha ho letho mona la khale.
I do not want to be.	Ha ke batle ho ba.
Then they went to sleep.	Eaba ba ea robala.
He agreed to see it.	O ile a lumela ho e bona.
The question is whether it really is.	Potso ke hore na ehlile ho joalo.
The woman was not present at that time.	Ka nako eo mosali eo o ne a le sieo ho eena.
Clearly, this was a mistake.	Ho hlakile hore sena e ne e le phoso.
It does not seem to work.	Ha e bonahale e sebetsa.
Everyone has a chance to suffer.	Batho bohle ba na le monyetla oa ho utloa bohloko.
He was with them.	O ne a ena le bona.
I do not understand how.	Ha ke utloisise hore na joang.
Maybe he didn't like it.	Mohlomong o ne a sa e rate.
However, there is no time to do that.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho nako ea ho etsa joalo.
Someone will come and get it.	Motho e mong o tla tla ho o nka.
Thus, constant energy would be needed.	Kahoo, matla a kamehla a ne a tla hlokahala.
And it's easy to do.	'Me ho bonolo ho e etsa.
Sometimes it is difficult to do this.	Ka linako tse ling ho thata ho etsa sena.
The water was surprisingly clear.	Metsi a ne a hlakile ka tsela e makatsang.
They decided not to attend the party.	Ba ile ba etsa qeto ea hore ba se ke ba ea moketeng oo.
It was his.	E ne e le wa hae.
My son uses it every day.	Mora oa ka o e sebelisa letsatsi le leng le le leng.
That was really weird.	Eo e ne e hlile e le ntho e makatsang.
He was not good at all.	O ne a se motle ho hang.
I am not anyone, except myself.	Ha ke mang kapa mang, ntle le 'na.
Such precious water, if not excess, is essential.	Metsi a bohlokoa joalo, haeba e se ho feta, a bohlokoa.
He wondered about their lives before this.	O ne a ipotsa ka bophelo ba bona pele ho sena.
This was very close.	Sena se ne se le haufi haholo.
You too are wet.	Le uena u metsi.
However, he continued.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a tsoela pele.
Don't talk about being alone with me, man.	U se ke ua bua ka ho ba mong ho 'na, motho.
It was an important job.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa bohlokoa.
There would be no room.	Ho ka be ho se na kamore.
That's the way he is.	Ke kamoo a leng kateng.
Some had no idea why.	Ba bang ba ne ba se na maikutlo a hore na ke hobane'ng.
Yet he seems to have done so.	Leha ho le joalo ho bonahala a entse joalo.
Think.	Nahana.
This is my place.	Sena ke sebaka sa ka.
He is a team player.	Ke sebapali sa sehlopha.
You do not need a reason.	Ha o hloke lebaka.
You can have a house.	U ka ba le ntlo.
Please, no more.	Ka kopo, ha ho sa le joalo.
You know what would happen.	U tseba se neng se tla etsahala.
It needs to know.	Ho hlokahala ho tseba.
He thought he had done it.	O ne a nahana hore o e entse.
The dog was coming back.	Ntja e ne e khutla.
And now she knew what she was.	Mme jwale e ne e tseba seo a neng a le sona.
Indeed, it is.	Ka sebele, ho joalo.
The same holds for now.	E tšoanang e tšoara hona joale.
This happens sometimes.	Sena se etsahala ka linako tse ling.
But it was.	Empa ho ne ho le joalo.
He loves her very much.	O mo rata haholo.
And who can it be, you say.	'Me e ka ba mang, u re.
He often does not care.	Hangata ha a tsotelle.
It's going to happen, it's going to happen, it's going to happen.	Ho tla etsahala, ho tla etsahala, ho tla etsahala.
But to him, it was nothing.	Empa ho eena, e ne e se letho.
Take a book, instead of me.	O nke o nka buka, sebakeng sa ka.
That was a lot.	Seo se ne se le ngata.
For one thing it is very simple.	Ka lebaka le le leng le bonolo haholo.
I did not know.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe.
Not today.	Ha se le kajeno.
And it presents the same problem.	'Me e fana ka bothata bo tšoanang.
Or it does not matter.	Kapa ha ho na taba.
We begin to see what is happening.	Re qala ho bona se etsahalang.
Something.	Ho hong.
You have that opportunity.	O na le monyetla oo.
I just say this to be true.	Ke mpa ke bolela sena e le 'nete.
I mean do nothing.	Ke bolela ho se etse letho.
Using it is not a good practice just because.	Ho sebelisa ha se mokhoa o motle hobane feela.
Know when to say yes, and when to say no.	Tseba nako ea ho re e, le hore na u hana neng.
Work was work.	Mosebetsi e ne e le mosebetsi.
And if not.	'Me haeba ha ho joalo.
Things were better for everyone when he was here.	Lintho li ne li le betere ho bohle ha a le mona.
Thank you, thank you.	Kea leboha, kea leboha.
Maybe they can just walk away.	Mohlomong ba ka mpa ba tsamaea.
In a good way.	Ka tsela e ntle.
Some closer than others.	Ba bang haufinyane ho feta ba bang.
Want more?	U batla tse ling?
I can't.	Ha ke khone.
It was not the best.	E ne e se molemo ka ho fetisisa.
There are many more than we are.	Ho na le ba bangata ho feta rona.
I have other problems.	Ke na le mathata a mang.
For some, it will be both.	Ho ba bang, e tla ba bobeli.
Everything was there, and it is.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e le teng, 'me e teng.
He really is.	Ehlile ke eena.
And so they often were.	'Me kahoo hangata ba ne ba le joalo.
They felt the same way.	Ba ne ba ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
Almost easy money.	Chelete e batlang e le bonolo.
He didn't care about that, either.	O ne a sa tsotelle seo, le hona.
I'm still thinking about it.	Ke ntse ke nahana ka eona.
That's pretty cool, isn't it?	E ntle haholo, na ha ho joalo?
Those who like to do work rather than read.	Ba ratang ho etsa mosebetsi ho ena le ho bala.
You are one of his.	U e mong oa hae.
It was crying.	E ne e lla.
I know where we will keep it.	Ke tseba moo re tla e boloka teng.
As a result, it sometimes looks old-fashioned or out-of-date.	Ka lebaka leo, ka linako tse ling e shebahala e le ea khale kapa ea khale.
He needs to hear it from you.	O hloka ho e utloa ho uena.
That was a difficult decision.	Eo e ne e le qeto e boima.
There is nothing easy here.	Ha ho letho le bonolo mona.
Only in the room.	Ka kamoreng feela.
They did not behave well.	Ha baa ka ba tšoara hantle.
The question is how to find that.	Potso ke hore na re ka fumana seo joang.
Of course, it can be even easier.	Ha e le hantle, ho ka ba bonolo le ho feta.
He certainly would not.	Ka sebele o ne a sa tl'o.
When he walks, we walk.	Ha a tsamaea, rea tsamaea.
How will I know.	Ke tla tseba joang.
We leave after a day.	Re tloha ka mor'a letsatsi.
Money can buy anything.	Chelete e ka reka eng kapa eng.
And that’s how we think about it.	'Me ke kamoo re nahanang ka eona.
I hope it continues every day.	Ke tšepa hore e tsoela pele letsatsi le leng le le leng.
You can get it.	U ka e fumana.
It was only once.	E bile hang feela.
This went on for a very long time.	Sena se ile sa tsoela pele ka nako e telele haholo.
Some are good, some are not.	Tse ling li ntle, tse ling ha li joalo.
It will be very fun.	Ho tla ba monate haholo.
Many people were there with others.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba le teng le ba bang.
Here is another thing to consider.	Ntho e 'ngoe eo u lokelang ho e nahana ke ena.
The good thing is just to get started.	Ntho e ntle ke ho qala feela.
Here we provide just one of them.	Mona re fana ka e le 'ngoe feela ea tsona.
I know, and everybody here knows, right where he is.	Ke a tseba, mme e mong le e mong mona o a tseba, hantle moo a leng teng.
Yet I do not speak to myself.	Leha ho le joalo ha ke bue le 'na.
I think your son will understand that over time.	Ke nahana hore mora oa hau o tla utloisisa seo ha nako e ntse e ea.
Then go home.	Joale khutlela hae.
Three years before.	Lilemo tse tharo pele.
My husband is out.	Monna oa ka oa tsoa.
At one point a young man seemed to be getting a picture.	Ka nako e 'ngoe mohlankana o ne a bonahala a fumana setšoantšo.
I do not understand this.	Ha ke utloisise sena.
If not, try these.	Haeba ho se joalo, leka tsena.
That was very close to me.	Seo se ne se le haufi haholo le nna.
You never have to go back again.	Ha ua lokela ho khutlela morao hape.
I have not seen my children yet.	Ha ke so bone bana ba ka hona joale.
Then he came in.	Eaba o kena.
It was not necessary.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale.
We need a new way.	Re hloka tsela e ncha.
There is a better presence.	Ho na le betere ho ba teng.
That is not good.	Seo ha se setle.
I feel it more.	Ke e utloa ho feta.
They will not come to the feast.	Ba ke ke ba tla moketeng.
There is nothing wrong with me.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka 'na.
He is with you.	O na le uena.
But it would never happen again.	Empa e ne e ke ke ea hlola e e-ba teng.
Everything he expected to happen has never happened.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo a neng a lebeletse hore e tla etsahala ha e e-s'o ka e etsahala.
My father was there.	Ntate o ne a le teng.
He would find something better too.	O ne a tla fumana ho hong ho molemo le ho bona.
It can be his, it can be yours.	E ka ba ea hae, e ka ba ea hau.
It will mean more than you know !.	E tla bolela ho feta kamoo u tsebang!.
And we probably wouldn’t have hurt so much.	'Me mohlomong re ne re ke ke ra utloa bohloko haholo.
Do what will be important to you.	Etsa seo e tla ba sa bohlokoa ho uena.
To him, the law was a law.	Ho eena, molao e ne e le molao.
It is now very easy to do.	Hona joale ho bonolo haholo ho e etsa.
He only uses people to get what he wants and then moves on.	O sebelisa batho feela ho fumana seo a se batlang ebe o tsoela pele.
But they are there.	Empa li teng.
There was no one there.	Ho ne ho se na motho.
It came to him that he could ask.	Ho ile ha tla ho eena hore a ka botsa.
He was living with his mother at the time.	O ne a lula le ’mè oa hae ka nako eo.
It could have been his son.	E ka be e bile mora oa hae.
There it is!	Ke eo!
I didn't care.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle letho.
Reading a book is very important.	Ho bala buka ho bohlokoa haholo.
But that should not be the case.	Empa seo ha sea lokela ho ba joalo.
This is as good a place as any other.	Sena ke sebaka se setle joalo ka se seng.
But you should definitely sleep.	Empa ka sebele u lokela ho robala.
Now think of that.	Jwale nahana ka seo.
So you should never forget this.	Kahoo ha ua lokela ho lebala sena le ka mohla.
I'm glad to hear this.	Ke thabetse ho utloa sena.
It's weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang.
Maybe I was invisible.	Mohlomong ke ne ke sa bonahale.
We hope this helps.	Rea tšepa hore sena sea thusa.
And you can still play with your beautiful new dog.	'Me u ntse u ka bapala le ntja ea hau e ncha e ntle.
Probably the one you know best.	Mohlomong ke eona eo u e tsebang haholo.
We can try it now.	Re ka e leka hona joale.
He said there were times when he felt like he could walk.	A re ho na le linako tseo ka tsona a neng a ikutloa eka a ka tsamaea.
However, this is not enough.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha sea lekana.
He does those things for a reason.	O etsa lintho tseo ka lebaka.
He was just beginning to want to do this.	O ne a qala ho batla ho etsa sena.
It was just weird.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang feela.
And the night was empty.	Mme bosiu bo ne bo se na letho.
That is not good.	Seo ha se molemo.
We did not do that.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
But that is no longer the case.	Empa ha ho sa le joalo.
Although they did.	Le hoja ba ile ba etsa joalo.
Leaving his school.	Ho tlohela sekolo sa hae.
We do not know anyone.	Ha ho motho eo re mo tsebang.
Our day was on the move.	Letsatsi la rona le ne le ntse le tsoela pele.
I almost fell.	Ke ile ka batla ke oa.
Some have an opinion.	Ba bang ba na le maikutlo.
And he should not.	Mme ha a lokela.
Its power drives us.	Matla a eona a re khanna.
She cried out loud.	O ile a lla ka matla.
I hope you have a wonderful day.	Ke tšepa hore u na le letsatsi le monate.
To live.	Ea ho phela.
I hope you find something too!	Ke tšepa hore le uena u tla fumana ho hong!
That's what makes people love him.	Ke sona se etsang hore batho ba mo rate.
We took the less crowded road.	Re ile ra nka tsela e se nang batho ba bangata.
I'm trying to help you out here.	Ke leka ho o thusa ka ntle mona.
There was nothing in it.	Ho ne ho se letho ho eona.
Then he left.	Eaba oa tsamaea.
Take a whole week.	Nka beke kaofela.
We have to go!	Re tlameha ho tsamaea!
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
I hope you enjoy reading them.	Ke tšepa hore u tla thabela ho li bala.
We drove together.	Re ile ra khanna hammoho.
You can read about it here.	U ka bala ka eona mona.
This can be the most amazing thing.	Ena e ka ba ntho e makatsang ho feta tsohle.
Everyone is playing without me!	Bohle baa bapala ntle le nna!
Not for long.	E seng nako e telele.
I think they finished it.	Ke nahana hore ba ile ba e qeta.
We can learn by doing.	Re ka ithuta ka ho etsa.
Yet they do not.	Leha ho le joalo ha ba etse joalo.
They were human once, long ago.	E ne e le batho hang, khale haholo.
I do not understand it.	Ha ke e utloisise.
What was wrong with staying home.	Ke eng e neng e le phoso ka ho lula hae.
He rejected their views.	O ile a hana maikutlo a bona.
But the best part is that this group is mine.	Empa molemo haholo ke hore sehlopha sena ke sa ka.
But you probably want to keep it simple.	Empa mohlomong u batla ho e boloka e le bonolo.
I'll say it again, just.	Ke tla e bua hape, feela.
They had legs.	Ba ne ba na le maoto.
I don't know who these people are.	Ha ke tsebe hore na batho bana ke bo mang.
I found him again.	Ke ile ka mo fumana hape.
They did this.	Sena ba se entse.
How wet was the road?	Tsela e ne e le metsi hakae?
Maybe it was an accident.	Mohlomong e bile kotsi.
I would appreciate it if you could do this every day.	Nka thabela ha o ka etsa sena letsatsi le letsatsi.
The task is simple enough, but one is very careful.	Mosebetsi o bonolo ka ho lekaneng, empa motho o hlokomela haholo.
We can see it here with them.	Re ka e bona mona le bona.
You can talk to anyone.	U ka bua le mang kapa mang.
There are some things that are hard to do.	Ho na le lintho tse itseng tseo ho leng thata ho li etsa.
So he let them go with him.	Kahoo a ba tlohela hore ba tsamaee le eena.
He enjoyed eating these foods.	O ne a thabela ho ja lijo tsena.
He was a child.	E ne e le ngoana.
Of course it is.	Ehlile ho jwalo.
It did him no good.	Ha ea ka ea mo etsetsa letho.
There were many things he did not know.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a neng a sa li tsebe.
He did not notice the police car.	Ha aa ka a hlokomela koloi ea mapolesa.
User friendly.	Ho bonolo ho e sebelisa.
I'm not sure he loves her.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore oa mo rata.
But he knew more than to ask.	Empa o ne a tseba ho feta ho botsa.
We have to go see him.	Re tlameha ho ea mo bona.
It is never real to them.	Ha ho mohla e leng oa sebele ho bona.
But many will try to find work elsewhere.	Empa ba bangata ba tla leka ho fumana mosebetsi sebakeng se seng.
To me, it is.	Ho 'na, ho joalo.
Take your place.	Nka sebaka sa hau.
I will not finish until the evening.	Ha ke na ho qeta ho fihlela mantsiboea.
It was very simple, of course.	E ne e le bonolo haholo, ha e le hantle.
I thought he would ask.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tla botsa.
That is his job.	Oo ke mosebetsi oa hae.
This is a real old thing.	Ena ke ntho ea sebele ea khale.
Express opinion.	Bolela maikutlo.
If they do, they take their children to see it.	Haeba ba etsa joalo, ba nka bana ba bona ho ea e bona.
I have to know about them, too.	Ke tlameha ho tseba ka bona, hape.
All are equal before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.	Batho bohle baa lekana pele ho molao.
I'm sorry to be so late.	Ke masoabi ho ba morao haholo.
He did well.	O entse hantle.
Thank you so much !!.	Ke leboha haholo!!.
Parents should tell their children daily.	Batsoali ba lokela ho bolella bana ba bona letsatsi le leng le le leng.
But it was because he had nothing.	Empa ke hobane o ne a se na letho.
Here is a man who can do anything.	Mona ke monna ea ka khonang ho etsa eng kapa eng.
He loved her very much.	O ne a mo rata haholo.
No, this method is even more fun.	Che, mokhoa ona o monate le ho feta.
He obviously did not think this well.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a sa nahana sena hantle.
However, some fun times.	Leha ho le joalo, linako tse ling tse monate.
Only you.	Ke uena feela.
I did not have enough time.	Ke ne ke sena nako e lekaneng.
It is too wet to swim.	Ho metsi haholo ho ea sesa.
Now that is a strong issue.	Joale ke taba e matla.
People want to go their own way.	Batho ba lakatsa ho tsamaea ka tsela ea bona.
He had nothing to fear.	O ne a se na letho leo a lokelang ho le tšaba.
We need to talk.	Re lokela ho bua.
So the road became even more difficult.	Kahoo tsela e ile ea e-ba thata le ho feta.
That's another one.	Ke e mong.
He could have told the police for him.	A ka be a ile a bolella mapolesa bakeng sa hae.
He would do it for her.	O ne a tla mo etsetsa eona.
They believe in and will do whatever they want.	Ba lumela ho 'me ba tla etsa eng kapa eng eo ba e hlokang.
Whether he was on foot or on the ground.	Hore na o ne a le ka maoto kapa fatše.
The real thing is the present moment.	Ntho ea sebele ke nako ea hona joale.
He was very nice to work with.	O ne a le motle haholo ho sebetsa le eena.
You were expecting it to happen.	U ne u lebeletse hore e tla etsahala.
It comes to you.	E tla ho wena.
There were some now.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse ling joale.
It is a book about getting started.	Ke buka e buang ka ho qala.
Otherwise, they would soon fall.	Ho seng joalo, ba ne ba tla oa haufinyane.
Now it is not.	Jwale ha ho jwalo.
Before he leaves, he must give up his job.	Pele a tsamaea, o tlameha ho fana ka mosebetsi oa hae.
He wanted to do it.	O ne a batla ho e etsa.
The car was still there.	Koloi e ne e ntse e le teng.
I was so happy because they were so happy.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo hobane ba ne ba thabile haholo.
Thank you !.	Kea leboha!.
No, he does not.	Che, ha a hloke.
I still had to see what Dad was like.	Ke ne ke ntse ke tlameha ho bona hore na Ntate o joang.
It was about my family.	E ne e bua ka lelapa la ka.
He must know his place.	O lokela ho tseba sebaka sa hae.
It was just painful.	Ho ne ho le bohloko feela.
And they did just that.	Mme ba etsa sona seo.
We were.	Re ne re .
It could have been that.	Ho ne ho ka etsahala hore ebe hoo.
I'm still thinking about him.	Ke ntse ke nahana ka eena.
Sometimes it is better to continue.	Ka linako tse ling ho molemo ho tsoela pele.
I'm not saying it's bad.	Ha ke re e mpe.
I'm not talking about this.	Ha ke bue ka taba ena.
I had nothing else.	Ke ne ke se na letho le leng.
But he had to make a decision.	Empa o ne a lokela ho etsa qeto.
The point is, we can never know.	Taba ke hore, re ke ke ra tseba seo.
The same is true of us.	Ho joalo le ka rōna.
Or almost everyone.	Kapa hoo e batlang e le motho e mong le e mong.
Maybe so and maybe not.	Mohlomong ho joalo mme mohlomong ha ho joalo.
But you will love it anyway.	Empa u tla e rata leha ho le joalo.
He told me about her.	O ile a mpolella ka eena.
My other wife.	Mosali oa ka o mong.
To know meant to know who.	Ho tseba ho ne ho bolela ho tseba mang.
Is that possible?	Na hoo ho ka etsahala?
I hear you man.	Kea u utloa monna.
Then it will be difficult.	Joale ho tla ba thata.
I'm wearing nice clothes, though not many of them.	Ke apere liaparo tse ntle, leha e se tse ngata tsa tsona.
Things are still the same.	Lintho li ntse li le joalo.
I have never seen a book that is hard to find.	Ha ke so bone buka eo ho leng thata ho e fumana.
I would like to go.	Ke lakatsa ho tsamaea.
If by man you mean good.	Haeba ka motho o bolela molemo.
He did not need it.	O ne a sa e hloke.
You need both.	U li hloka ka bobeli.
It lasted all night, but he finally fell asleep.	Ho ile ha nka bosiu bohle, empa qetellong o ile a robala.
He says he needs to know.	O bolela hore o hloka ho tseba.
Or it seemed, at times.	Kapa ho ne ho bonahala, ka linako tse ling.
Again.	Mo hape.
So he left without saying good-bye.	Kahoo a tsamaea a sa re hantle.
It will be easier as time goes on.	Ho tla ba bonolo ha nako e ntse e tsamaea.
The mother of.	'M'e oa.
Why it is needed.	Hobaneng ho hlokahala.
We could be in danger here.	Re ka ba kotsing mona.
At the end of the day, he was tired.	Qetellong ea letsatsi, o ne a khathetse.
She was a little embarrassed.	O ne a batla a le lihlong.
Yes, that would be great.	E, seo se tla ba molemo haholo.
However, he could have been worse.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a ka ba mpe le ho feta.
He probably slept all night, doing his homework.	E ka ’na eaba o ile a robala bosiu bohle, a etsa mosebetsi oa hae oa sekolo.
You need to save money for the baby.	U lokela ho boloka chelete bakeng sa ngoana.
And you can't fix things about yourself.	'Me u ke ke ua lokisa litaba ka uena.
You are very important locally.	U bohlokoa haholo sebakeng.
He says he will get money.	O re o tla fumana chelete.
Which he did not do.	E leng seo a sa kang a se etsa.
They had all the production there for dinner.	Ba bile le tlhahiso eohle moo bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
But he never told me who he was.	Empa ha ho mohla a kileng a mpolella hore na ke mang.
It did not, and it would not.	Ha ea ka ea etsa joalo, 'me e ne e ke ke ea khona.
However, he has that girl now.	Leha ho le joalo, o na le ngoanana eo hona joale.
I do not know what would be better for anyone.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke eng e ka bang molemo ho mang kapa mang.
They have one person now.	Ba na le motho a le mong hona joale.
We kept playing, of course.	Re ile ra tsoela pele ho bapala, ehlile.
These are important things.	Tsena li bohlokoa ho hong.
Clearly, he loves her.	Ho hlakile hore oa mo rata.
This is an old house.	Ena ke ntlo ea khale.
But it will be too late.	Empa e tla be e le morao haholo.
But you have it.	Empa u na le eona.
I had to help my dad.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho thusa Ntate.
He finally made a suggestion.	Qetellong o ile a etsa tlhahiso.
He could have paid someone else to take care of it.	A ka be a ile a lefa motho e mong ho e hlokomela.
I used to tell him that.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ho mo bolella joalo.
But it was hard to believe this.	Empa ho ne ho le thata ho lumela sena.
He could tell me what he was going to do for them first.	O ne a khona ho mpolella hore na o tla ba etsetsa eng pele.
He didn't seem to care what anyone thought.	O ne a bonahala a sa tsotelle hore na motho o nahana eng.
However, it probably is not.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong ha ho joalo.
However, it is good to know that you can do it.	Leha ho le joalo, ho molemo ho tseba hore u ka e etsa.
How did you do.	U entse joang .
You will not understand.	U ke ke ua utloisisa.
It will keep us together.	E tla re boloka re kopane.
And it was not his business to begin with.	Mme e ne e se taba ya hae le ho qala.
She looked at the baby.	A sheba ngoana.
But to you who haven't done that, now you know it.	Empa ho lona ba sa kang ba etsa jwalo, jwale le a e tseba.
They would not like it.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba e rata.
Just work.	Mosebetsi feela.
And by the way, you are not my son.	'Me ka tsela, ha u mora oa ka.
I'm so glad to hear he's home.	Ke thabile haholo ho utloa hore o hae.
Nobody wants to be that guy.	Ha ho motho ea batlang ho ba mohlankana eo.
It works great at any time of the night.	E sebetsa haholo ka nako efe kapa efe ea bosiu.
It makes life a lot easier.	E etsa hore bophelo bo be bonolo haholoanyane.
I'm very happy for you.	Ke o thabetse haholo.
Simply put, there is no way to do it.	Ka mokhoa o bonolo, ha ho na mokhoa oa ho e etsa.
Have a good time.	Eba le nako e monate.
All you can think of.	Sohle seo o ka se nahanang.
But they refused to come.	Empa ba hana ho tla.
He didn't know about that.	O ne a sa tsebe ka seo.
I thought he might be.	Ke ne ke nahana hore a ka ba joalo.
And what kind of hours they can work.	Le hore na ba ka sebetsa lihora tsa mofuta ofe.
To each other.	Ho mong ho e mong.
We start with ourselves.	Re qala ka rona.
It really is something.	Ehlile ke ntho e itseng.
He thanked them for coming.	O ile a ba leboha ka ho tla ha bona.
Some do a good job, some not so much.	Ba bang ba etsa mosebetsi o motle, ba bang ha ba joalo haholo.
They watched him intently.	Ba ile ba mo shebella ka hloko.
Yes, he could.	E, o ne a ka etsa joalo.
But the truth is more, it is worse than that.	Empa 'nete e ngata, e mpe haholo ho feta moo.
But the idea is bigger than that.	Empa mohopolo o moholo ho feta moo.
We could have lived longer.	Re ne re ka phela nako e telele.
She wanted a baby.	O ne a batla ngoana.
And that's not what you can say.	Mme seo ha se seo o ka se buang.
Considering what people are saying.	Ho nahana ka seo batho ba se buang.
That is why he stayed with her.	Ke ka lebaka leo a ileng a lula le eena.
Because they kept their people they could save energy.	Hobane ba ne ba boloka batho ba bona ba ne ba ka boloka matla.
You certainly would not want to see him.	Ka sebele u ne u ke ke ua lakatsa ho mo bona.
There are many things he did not mention.	Ho na le tse ngata tseo a sa buang ka tsona.
They start walking again.	Ba qala ho tsamaea hape.
All of these are very good.	Tsena tsohle li ntle haholo.
They were certainly not good parents.	Ka sebele e ne e se batsoali ba molemo.
Some of them you will do.	Tse ling tsa tsona u tla li etsa.
Just your job.	Mosebetsi oa hau feela.
He will want to see us.	O tla batla ho re bona.
However, the place was empty.	Leha ho le joalo, sebaka se ne se se na letho.
I took.	Ke ile ka nka.
I have no power to do it.	Ha ke na matla a ho e etsa.
You should not drink and drive.	Ha ua lokela ho noa le ho khanna.
Never give up '.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua tlohela '.
Then we will have to go back to school.	Joale re tla tlameha ho khutlela sekolong.
It is very difficult.	Ho thata haholo.
I am sure of it.	Ke na le bonnete ba eona.
Who you really know.	Eo ka sebele u tsebang.
It is very easy to do.	Ho bonolo haholo ho e etsa.
Loving people.	Ho rata batho.
You will not have to wait for hours and days.	U ke ke ua tlameha ho ema lihora le matsatsi.
It has never been a question of whether.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba potso ea hore na.
It was still very difficult.	E ne e ntse e le thata haholo.
However, this is difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se thata.
It was not necessary.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale.
She looked beautiful.	O ne a shebahala a le motle.
Either way it will work but some may be better than others.	Mofuta ofe kapa ofe o tla etsa empa tse ling li ka ba betere ho feta tse ling.
If you can, do your best to try them out several times.	Haeba u khona, etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang ho li leka ka makhetlo a 'maloa.
You have to take it easy.	O lokela ho nka ha bonolo.
I'm just saying it's possible.	Ke mpa ke re ho ka etsahala.
It’s the same news.	Ke litaba tse tšoanang.
I got it right.	Ke e fumane hantle.
He opens it, reads it.	O a e bula, a bala.
Lots of money without benefit.	Chelete e ngata ntle le molemo.
I'm sorry.	Ke masoabi.
He does not say what.	Ha a re eng.
However, time passed.	Leha ho le joalo, nako e ile ea tsamaea.
He worked very hard.	O ne a sebetsa ka thata haholo.
It took too much time.	E ne e nka nako e ngata haholo.
The boy has a clear idea of ​​what he is doing.	Moshanyana eo o tseba hantle seo a se etsang.
Keeping things just as real, mom.	Ho boloka lintho e le 'nete feela,' mè.
You can even go with me.	U ka ba ua tsamaea le 'na.
I am sure you will read well.	Ke bonnete ba hore o tla bala hantle.
You no longer ask yourself these questions.	Ha u sa ipotsa lipotso tsena.
I'm so glad I got it.	Ke thabile haholo hore ebe ke o fumane.
Be very good.	Eba hantle haholo.
This is his legal status.	Ena ke boemo ba hae ba molao.
Even here.	Leha e le hona mona.
Have you heard this.	Na u utloile sena.
Yes of course.	Ehlile ho joalo.
And getting out of the car.	Le ho tsoa ka koloi.
Work, sleep at school.	Mosebetsi, robala sekolong.
We do not know what it means.	Ha re tsebe hore na e bolela eng.
Things that happened.	Lintho tse etsahetseng.
I mean he knows exactly what he's doing.	Ke bolela hore o tseba hantle seo a se etsang.
If there was something there they would have found it.	Hoja ho ne ho ena le ntho e teng moo ba ka be ba e fumane.
And he will not give us any money.	'Me a ke ke a re fa chelete leha e le efe.
However, it still happens to me.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ntse ho etsahala ho 'na.
Just listen.	Utloa feela.
Put on your best clothes when you go out today.	Apara liaparo tsa hau tse ntle ha u tsoa kajeno.
He always did.	Kamehla o ne a etsa joalo.
Sit here and talk to me.	Dula mona o bue le nna.
So we want a name.	Kahoo re batla lebitso.
If things did not go well, they would have to give up.	Haeba lintho li ne li sa tsamaee hantle ba ne ba ka li tlohela.
You can read more about that here.	U ka bala haholoanyane ka seo mona.
Tell them they are alone.	Ba bolelle hore ba le bang.
For us, this is necessary.	Ho rona, sena sea hlokahala.
Really a dog.	Ka sebele ntja.
If he won they would let him go.	Haeba a ne a ka hlola ba ne ba tla mo tlohela.
He saved money.	O ile a boloka chelete.
There needs to be some of those moments.	Ho hlokahala hore ho be le tse ling tsa linako tseo.
This is good.	Sena se setle.
Yes, this is still happening.	E, sena se ntse se etsahala.
Gently, but he took it.	Ka bonolo, empa o ile a e nka.
Too many.	Ho ba ngata haholo.
Well, it doesn't matter.	Be, ha ho na taba.
I didn’t think of any better way than last day.	Ke ne ke sa nahane ka tsela e ’ngoe e molemo ho feta ea ho qetela letsatsi leo.
I don't need that this morning.	Ha ke hloke seo hoseng hona.
Of course he would pass.	Ehlile o ne a tla feta.
That was the only reason.	E ne e le lona feela lebaka.
He looked at the others.	A sheba ba bang.
Sometimes, that really happens.	Ka linako tse ling, seo se hlile se etsahala.
And tell your friends to do the same.	'Me u bolelle metsoalle ea hao hore e etse se tšoanang.
We were together almost always.	Re ne re le hammoho hoo e ka bang ka linako tsohle.
I thought you felt the same way.	Ke ne ke nahana hore le uena u ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
It was a thing.	E ne e le ntho.
But that is not the case here.	Empa ha ho joalo mona.
They all use that method.	Kaofela ha bona ba sebelisa mokhoa oo.
Make them understand.	Etsa hore ba utloisise.
But that is not our business.	Empa eo hase taba ea rona.
We are moving from here.	Re tsamaea ho tloha mona.
And maybe we.	'Me mohlomong re.
It's a wonderful day for her.	Ke letsatsi le monate ho eena.
Well, some more than others.	Hantle, ba bang ho feta ba bang.
I can't do anything about it.	Ha ke khone ho etsa letho ka eona.
I do not think it is easy.	Ha ke nahane hore ho bonolo.
They didn't have to win it and they didn't win it.	Ba ne ba sa tlameha ho e hlola mme ha ba a ka ba e hlola.
He is still the same.	O ntse a le jwalo.
They just call and say they are going with someone else.	Ba mpa ba letsa feela ba re ba tsamaea le motho e mong.
He had to come soon.	O ne a lokela ho tla kapele.
And every reason to do so.	Le lebaka le leng le le leng la ho etsa joalo.
He knew that.	O ne a tseba seo.
He didn't care enough to wonder what it was.	O ne a sa tsotelle ho lekana ho ipotsa hore na ke eng.
He is leaving.	Oa tsamaea.
There are many missing.	Ho na le tse ngata tse sieo.
I was present when he died.	Ke ne ke le teng ha a hlokahala.
Any possible suggestion.	Tlhahiso efe kapa efe e ka bang teng.
Lots of people there, the car is so good.	Batho ba bangata moo, koloi e ntle hakana.
He was the first man of his kind he had ever met.	E ne e le monna oa pele oa mofuta oa hae eo a kileng a kopana le eena.
Go eat.	E ya o ja.
He has no other family.	Ha a na lelapa le leng.
But we do not have them.	Empa ha re na tsona.
You will learn in the end.	U tla ithuta qetellong.
And there were problems.	'Me ho ne ho e-na le mathata.
We did not pay for this.	Ha rea ​​lefa sena.
It still hurts.	Ho ntse ho le bohloko.
But let's not say it can't.	Empa ha re re e ke ke ea khona.
They would not tell me.	Ba ne ba sa tlo mpolella.
This is not an immediate problem.	Sena ha se bothata hang hang.
I need to be here.	Ke hloka ho ba mona.
I have to stay.	Ke tlameha ho lula.
Everything seemed to exist.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e bonahala e le teng.
It's his problem, not my problem.	Ke bothata ba hae, ha se bothata ba ka.
There can be no other reason.	Ho ka se be le lebaka le leng.
He lets her go.	O a mo tlohela.
He is not here.	Ha a eo mona.
There would be no place for me.	Ho ka be ho se sebaka sa ka.
But surely nothing else will.	Empa ka sebele ha ho letho le leng le tla etsa joalo.
He asked the woman who did not say what had happened.	O ile a botsa mosali ea sa kang a bolela hore na ho etsahetse'ng.
Some days are like that.	Matsatsi a mang a joalo.
It was his reason for living, the work of his life.	E ne e le lebaka la hae la ho phela, mosebetsi oa bophelo ba hae.
It was not just an idea.	E ne e se feela maikutlo.
He had long known that it would happen.	E ne e se e le khale a tseba hore e tla etsahala.
So, there is.	Kahoo, ho na le.
They are not things.	Ha se lintho.
Many thought he loved her.	Ba bangata ba ne ba nahana hore oa mo rata.
It was not my idea.	E ne e se mohopolo oa ka.
You have to make a decision today.	O lokela ho etsa qeto kajeno.
No problem for any friends.	Ha ho bothata ho metsoalle leha e le efe.
And he had done it.	Mme o ne a e entse.
There was nothing more I could say.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng leo nka le buang.
So that was pretty cool.	Kahoo seo se ne se le ntle haholo.
Enjoy talking about anything.	Ho thabela ho bua ka eng kapa eng.
He lived nearby.	O ne a lula haufi.
I thought about it a lot.	Ke ile ka nahana ka eona haholo.
Of course, my car was fine.	Ehlile, koloi ea ka e ne e le hantle.
I'm glad to be here.	Ke thabetse ho ba mona.
They know we are stronger.	Ba tseba hore re matla ho feta.
He kept talking and talking.	A nna a bua le ho bua.
This will be the fourth.	Ena e tla ba ea bone.
Some of them still don't know anything.	Ba bang ba bona ha ba e-so tsebe letho.
This was certainly true.	Ka sebele sena e ne e le ’nete.
The one they wanted.	Eo ba neng ba e batla.
But time passed.	Empa nako e ile ea feta.
You certainly were.	Ka sebele u ne u le joalo.
He gives everything.	O fana ka tsohle.
So now you come back to me.	Kahoo joale u khutlela ho 'na.
There are many more!	Ho na le tse ling tse ngata!
He can't see.	Ha a bone.
I loved clothes that had a past.	Ke ne ke rata liaparo tse nang le nako e fetileng.
I need to see it.	Ke hloka ho o bona.
Will they let him get another one.	Na ba tla mo lumella ho fumana e 'ngoe.
It was an idea that came and went.	E ne e le mohopolo o ileng oa fihla oa feta.
I asked for it.	Ke ile ka e kopa.
Certainly there are questions.	Ka sebele lipotso li teng.
I hope you like it !.	Kea tšepa hore ua e rata!.
But it's hard to take that.	Empa ho thata ho nka seo.
I did not take them.	Ha kea ka ka li nka.
That means a lot.	Seo se bolela haholo.
I wish it didn’t have it.	Ke lakatsa eka e ka be e se na eona.
To most people, the news is nonexistent.	Ho batho ba bangata, litaba ha li eo.
But he does not say anything.	Empa ha a bue letho.
We really enjoyed them.	Re ne re li thabela haholo.
I don't want to plan too much.	Ha ke batle ho rera esale pele haholo.
I hear from them every day.	Ke utloa ho tsoa ho bona letsatsi le letsatsi.
There was no question, of course.	Ho ne ho se na potso, ehlile.
Maybe he would see.	Mohlomong o ne a tla bona.
It means to give.	Ho bolela ho fana .
Just be careful.	Feela hlokomela.
Watch what they do.	Sheba seo ba se etsang.
You have to know that they exist.	O tlameha ho tseba hore ba teng.
But we are just friends.	Empa re metsoalle feela.
Whose issue was this?	Taba ee e ne e le ea mang?
I can't say enough good things about them.	Ha ke khone ho bua lintho tse ntle tse lekaneng ka bona.
I know a lot.	Ke tseba haholo.
He would not have the strength.	O ne a ke ke a ba le matla.
You know where my head is.	O tseba moo hlooho ya ka e leng teng.
It would have been good for him and for all the people.	Ho ka be ho bile molemo ho eena le ho batho bohle.
They remained close friends.	Ba ile ba lula e le metsoalle e haufi.
Or from him.	Kapa ho tsoa ho eena.
It was nice to talk to him.	Ho ne ho le monate ho bua le eena.
I worked before I worked every day.	Ke ne ke sebetsa pele ke sebetsa letsatsi le leng le le leng.
She is such an amazing child.	Ke ngoana ea makatsang joalo.
He can't get that every week.	A ke ke a fumana seo beke le beke.
This is probably the most bizarre thing.	Ena mohlomong ke ntho e makatsang ka ho fetisisa.
The young man said nothing.	Mohlankana ha aa ka a bua letho.
It's none of our business.	Ha se taba ea rona.
So that's another matter.	Kahoo ke taba e 'ngoe hape.
I didn’t know I was this week until last night.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore ke bekeng ena ho fihlela bosiung bo fetileng.
I wanted to do it for real.	Ke ne ke batla ho e etsa ka 'nete.
However, such a method is very difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, mokhoa o joalo o thata haholo.
They are very happy.	Ba thabile haholo.
We will never forget you.	Re ke ke ra u lebala le ka mohla.
I’m sure some people were caught more.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore batho ba bang ba ile ba tšoaroa ho feta.
There were so many things he wanted to tell her.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a neng a batla ho mo bolella tsona.
There he is.	Ke eena moo.
It should be good to read.	E lokela ho ba molemo ho bala.
She kept crying.	A nna a lla.
We can all do that, or something like that.	Kaofela re ka etsa joalo, kapa ntho e kang eona.
I can be with them.	Nka ba teng le bona.
No, you have to go.	Che, u lokela ho tsamaea.
Here, life was not easy.	Mona, bophelo bo ne bo se bonolo.
If you had an idea.	Haeba u ne u e-na le maikutlo.
These are all problems right now.	Tsena kaofela ke mathata hona joale.
I usually had only a few hours to do things.	Hangata ke ne ke e-ba le lihora tse seng kae feela hore ke etse lintho.
Your parents are there.	Batsoali ba hao ba teng.
You are not my father.	Ha u ntate oa ka.
It happens.	Hoa etsahala.
It's your turn to speak.	Ke nako ea hao ea ho bua.
We must take care of our people first.	Re tlameha ho hlokomela batho ba rona pele.
He is no longer a child.	Ha e sa le ngoana.
What time is it, he asked.	Ke nako mang, a botsa.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
He was alone at all.	O ne a le mong ho hang.
The other one was me.	E mong e ne e le ’na.
He is applying now.	O ntse a etsa kopo hona joale.
Some read only books.	Ba bang ba bala libuka feela.
There is also someone who needs to be aware of these issues.	Hape ho na le motho ea lokelang ho hlokomela litaba tsena.
We were tired, but we were happy.	Re ne re khathetse, empa re thabile.
They could not reach a conclusion.	Ha baa khona ho fihlela qeto.
They don't want to.	Ha ba batle.
They said it was true.	Ba ile ba bolela hore ke ’nete.
Of course, we now know that it is.	Ha e le hantle, hona joale rea tseba hore ho joalo.
We were looking forward to it.	Re ne re ntse re e lebeletse.
Your power is all.	Matla a hao ke tsohle.
A few years, maybe more.	Lilemo tse 'maloa, mohlomong ho feta.
However, he needed to try something, anything.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a hloka ho leka ho hong, eng kapa eng.
None of the people there knew who the man was.	Ha ho le ea mong oa ba neng ba le moo ea neng a tseba hore na motho eo ke mang.
He has his power.	O na le matla a hae.
But it would not be easy.	Empa ho ne ho ka se be bonolo.
This can save you money and time.	Sena se ka boloka chelete le nako.
Her first son.	Mora oa hae oa pele.
I like it, but my parents didn't like it.	Kea e rata, empa batsoali ba ka ha baa ka ba e rata.
This can help you if you want.	Sena se ka u thusa ha u batla.
We are stronger than this.	Re matla ho feta sena.
He ate his food.	O ile a ja lijo tsa hae.
I think this was the regular one.	Ke nahana hore ena e ne e le eona ea kamehla.
They never knew it.	Ho hang ha baa e tseba.
He tells me every day.	O mpolella letsatsi le letsatsi.
You cannot do both.	U ke ke ua khona ho li etsa ka bobeli feela.
This is an old problem.	Bona ke bothata ba khale.
Yes, he is with me.	Ee, o na le nna.
Until one day it did.	Ho fihlela ka letsatsi le leng e ile ea etsa joalo.
What do you want?	O batla eng?
But he does not want to help them.	Empa ha a batle ho ba thusa.
Having such an attitude will be fun.	Ho ba le maikutlo a joalo ho tla ba monate.
He could no longer walk.	O ne a ke ke a hlola a tsamaea.
Do what you want.	Etsa seo u se batlang.
It hurts a lot.	Ho bohloko haholo.
What was it like before?	Ho ne ho le joang pele?
When he would try anything.	Ha a ne a tla leka eng kapa eng.
I'm checking out.	Kea tsoa.
However, no one seemed to be thankful at all.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se le ea mong ea neng a bonahala a leboha ho hang.
There were others.	Ho ne ho e-na le ba bang.
People are working.	Batho baa sebetsa.
He will eat.	O tla ja.
If not, wait another day.	Haeba ho se joalo, ema letsatsi le leng.
So, do not do this.	Kahoo, u se ke ua etsa sena.
Finally, they left.	Qetellong, ba ile ba tsamaea.
The way he was sometimes.	Tsela eo a neng a le ka eona ka linako tse ling.
Playground is not a situation.	Sebaka sa ho bapala ha se boemo.
And she got it.	Mme o e fumane.
It should be very fun.	E lokela ho ba monate haholo.
But he was there now.	Empa o ne a le teng jwale.
No problems there.	Haho mathata moo.
He died a few years ago.	O ile a hlokahala lilemo tse 'maloa tse fetileng.
Something was happening outside.	Ho ne ho etsahala se seng ka ntle.
We would not want that.	Re ka se batle seo.
Doing something does nothing.	Ho etsa ntho e itseng ha ho etse letho.
It should not be so bad.	Ha ea lokela ho ba ntho e mpe hakana.
He has an amazing idea.	O na le mohopolo o makatsang.
So, it is no longer here.	Ka hona, ha ho sa le teng mona.
They certainly do not want to feel that way outside of work.	Ka sebele ha ba batle ho ikutloa joalo ka ntle ho mosebetsi.
We're having a party!	Re etsa mokete!
It's not just news.	Ha se litaba feela.
But look at all that happened.	Empa sheba tsohle tse etsahetseng.
Here he begins to look at it.	Mona o qala ho e sheba.
They said that we could talk to him only in the morning.	Ba ile ba re re ka bua le eena hoseng feela.
It was almost out.	E ne e batla e tsoa.
His hands.	Matsoho a hae.
We want people like him.	Re batla batho ba kang eena.
He did not know exactly what it was but he knew it was dangerous.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke eng empa a tseba hore e kotsi.
That was not the case.	Ho ne ho se joalo.
I feel good.	Ke ikutloa monate.
He was always happy to help.	O ne a lula a thabela ho thusa.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se joalo.
So we eat them with shame.	Kahoo re li ja ka lihlong.
I tell the child some things.	Ke bolella ngoana lintho tse ling.
He came to a stop and looked back.	A fihla a ema mme a sheba morao.
And there it is, of course.	Ebe ke moo, ehlile.
They said they had to work very fast.	Ba itse ba tlameha ho sebetsa kapele haholo.
Get what they want.	Fumana seo ba se batlang.
We spent all our money.	Re ile ra sebelisa chelete eohle ea rōna.
Or whatever they are.	Kapa eng kapa eng eo ba leng eona.
Her stomach felt empty.	Mpa ea hae e ne e ikutloa e se na letho.
That's all money.	Ke chelete kaofela.
Of course, good stuff.	Ha e le hantle, lintho tse monate.
It was the first time he had ever thought of such a thing.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele a nahana ka ntho e joalo.
We can go on for a long time.	Re ka tsoela pele nako e telele.
He could come in, if he wanted to.	O ne a ka kena, ha a batla.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
I'm talking about people.	Ke bua ka batho.
Human food.	Lijo tsa motho.
It is better not to cry.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua lla.
I have things to do.	Ke na le lintho tseo ke lokelang ho li etsa.
It is powerful and looks new.	Ke matla 'me e shebahala e le ncha.
Again, this was not new news.	Hape, sena e ne e se litaba tse ncha.
And there was a lot.	Mme ho ne ho le ngata.
It's really hard to understand.	Ho hlile ho thata ho utloisisa.
I would be fine now.	Ke ne ke tla phela hantle joale.
The night may not be the best.	Bosiu e ka 'na ea se ke ea e-ba molemo ka ho fetisisa .
He loves his people.	O rata batho ba hae.
It certainly has been that way for me.	Ka sebele ho bile joalo ho ’na.
I mean it, too.	Ke e bolela, hape.
I will be there.	Ke tla be ke le teng.
That alone is not an easy task.	Seo feela hase mosebetsi o bonolo.
It is better not to have children.	Ho molemo ho se be le bana.
Thank you so much !.	Kea leboha o motle!.
They were gone.	Ba ne ba se ba le sieo.
He suggested his place.	O ile a etsa tlhahiso ea sebaka sa hae.
But some find it useful.	Empa ba bang ba e fumana e le molemo.
We see nothing.	Ha re bone letho.
He looked at the letter.	A sheba lengolo leo.
He found his friends inadequate.	O ile a fumana metsoalle ea hae e sa lekana.
I needed to make friends.	Ke ne ke hloka ho ba le metsoalle.
This year there is something strange.	Selemong sena ho na le ntho e makatsang.
Many continue to be.	Ba bangata ba tsoela pele ho ba.
He did it, you know.	O e entse, ua tseba.
They cannot understand the feelings of others.	Ha ba khone ho utloisisa maikutlo a ba bang.
Though from him.	Leha a tsoa ho eena.
This is my life, this is my life.	Bona ke bophelo ba ka, bona ke bona.
I would love to see some of this !.	Nka thabela ho bona tse ling tsa sena !.
You have to have both.	U tlameha ho ba le bobeli.
It was just real.	Feela e ne e le ea sebele.
However, that was not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se joalo.
And anyone, of course.	Le mang kapa mang, ka 'nete.
It can be very dangerous.	E ka ba kotsi haholo.
So no problem there.	Kahoo ha ho bothata moo.
We are not sure what you can do about that.	Ha re na bonnete ba hore na u ka etsa'ng ka litaba tseo.
Does he look guilty?	Na o shebahala a le molato?
This may be their home, hers and hers.	Ena e ka 'na ea e-ba ntlo ea bona, ea hae le ea hae.
It will be here.	E tla ba mona.
For him to say it, it is very important.	Ho eena ho e bua, ho bohlokoa haholo.
And that is not easy.	Mme hoo ha ho bonolo.
Did you walk to work?	O ile oa tsamaea ka maoto ho ea mosebetsing?
As a result, many were arrested.	Ka hona, ba bangata ba ile ba tšoaroa.
It has to be you.	E lokela ho ba uena.
The issue is not how but how.	Taba ha se hore na empa joang.
And otherwise you will know.	Mme ha ho se jwalo o tla tseba.
Is that not the case?	Na tse joalo ha li joalo.
There was nothing there.	Ho ne ho se letho moo.
I will live again.	Ke tla phela hape.
They were invisible.	Li ne li sa bonahale.
I could see that she was crying.	Ke ile ka bona hore o ne a ntse a lla.
It may never happen again.	Mohlomong e ke ke ea hlola e etsahala.
He would not let her go.	O ne a ke ke a mo tlohela.
He was no longer my father.	E ne e se le ntate oa ka.
You don't get it for fun.	Ha o e fumane bakeng sa monate.
Here is my question to you.	Potso ea ka ho uena ke ena.
But this was not the case here.	Empa mona ho ne ho se joalo.
It can't be nothing.	E ka se be letho.
We paid our bills.	Re ile ra lefa chelete ea rōna.
Get out of school.	Tloha sekolong.
He is not there.	Ha a eo.
You have no decision now.	Ha u na qeto hona joale.
Perhaps some were.	Mohlomong ba bang ba ne ba le joalo.
We do not fully understand them.	Ha re li utloisise hantle.
It was a long time ago.	E ne e le khale.
We will never know.	Re ke ke ra tseba.
It is the same truth.	Ke 'nete e le 'ngoe.
I thought you were talking about me, but it wasn't.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o bua ka nna, empa ho ne ho se jwalo.
Look at the book and you want to see the work.	Sheba buka 'me u batla ho bona mosebetsi.
When people do things, they usually say them.	Ha batho ba etsa lintho, hangata ba li bolela.
This is not very fun.	Sena ha se monate haholo.
But he also said yes, often.	Empa le eena o ne a re e, hangata.
Or he may have.	Kapa a ka ba le .
He heard, but did not understand.	O ile a utloa, empa ha aa ka a utloisisa.
You know now.	O ya tseba jwale.
Yes, he has.	E, o na le eona.
Then don't watch it.	Joale u se ke ua e shebella.
It seems to be the case again.	Ho bonahala ho le joalo hape.
But he is not too busy.	Empa ha a phathahane hakaalo.
And everything looked very new.	'Me ntho e' ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e shebahala e le ncha haholo.
I hope people like it.	Ke tšepa hore batho ba e rata.
So you can stay home.	Kahoo u ka lula hae.
He was a very good professional.	E ne e le setsebi se hloahloa haholo.
Only one child is weird.	Ke ngoana a le mong feela ea makatsang.
I am sure it will work well.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o tla sebetsa hantle.
You will learn about it little by little.	U tla tseba ka eona hanyane ka hanyane.
This is not surprising.	Sena ha se ntho e makatsang.
Make sure you know about it ahead of time.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u tseba ka eona pele ho nako.
Which was clear.	E neng e hlakile.
He walked to school every day.	O ne a ya sekolong ka maoto letsatsi le leng le le leng.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
Again, there I am.	Hape, ke 'na eo.
But I feel much better.	Empa ke ikutloa ke le betere haholo.
Maybe she is the one who can cry.	Mohlomong ke eena ea ka khonang ho lla.
We don't have that.	Ha re na tseo.
He does it often.	O e etsa hangata.
You will have to stop and see.	U tla tlameha ho ema 'me u bone.
She was happy to be able to help.	O ne a thabetse hore ebe o khona ho thusa.
You do not see the sun hard.	Ha u bone letsatsi ka thata.
Maybe we do, maybe we don't.	Mohlomong re etsa joalo, mohlomong ha re etse joalo.
See, we haven't forgotten.	Le a bona, ha rea ​​lebala.
They start somewhere.	Ba qala sebakeng se seng.
Once they were there.	Hang ha ba ne ba le teng.
I'm still passing.	Ke sa ntse ke feta.
I nodded.	Ka mo kopa ka hlooho.
I can't be with you near me right now.	Ha ke khone ho ba le uena haufi le 'na hona joale.
However, it can be good for a book.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ka ba molemo bakeng sa buka.
I like water.	Ke rata metsi.
That makes me think about this.	Seo se etsa hore ke nahane ka taba ena.
Maybe because if you can, you will, and you do.	Mohlomong ke hobane haeba u khona, u tla khona, 'me u etsa joalo.
For decades, this trend continued.	Ka lilemo tse mashome, mokhoa ona o ile oa tsoela pele.
He can be good.	A ka ba molemo.
And some of them are still working.	'Me tse ling tsa tsona li ntse li sebetsa.
There is no place to go.	Ha ho sebaka sa ho feta.
He had work to do.	O ne a na le mosebetsi oo a lokelang ho o etsa.
Then you have to eat.	Joale u lokela ho ja.
In fact, it is more likely to happen sooner than we know.	Ha e le hantle, e ka ’na eaba e etsahala kapele ho feta kamoo re tsebang kateng.
He did not enjoy it.	Ha aa ka a e thabela.
First, that has never happened, now they have it more.	Pele, seo ha se e-so ka se etsahala, joale ba se ba e-na le eona ho feta.
That's not very fun.	Seo ha se monate haholo.
I would have done.	nka be ke entse.
I am not now.	Ha ke se 'na hona joale.
No one looked at him.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo sheba.
So stay tuned.	Kahoo lula.
Then he knew he wanted something.	Joale o ne a tseba hore o batla ho hong.
We will decide what happens there.	Re tla etsa qeto ea se etsahalang moo.
Power did not pay.	Matla ha a ka a lefa.
You can say you can't work with me.	U ka re u ke ke ua sebetsa le 'na.
And if that takes more.	'Me haeba seo se nka ho feta.
He thought, quickly.	O ne a nahana, kapele.
Just to get that.	Ho fumana seo feela.
No one helped her.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo thusa.
I was really able to get into it.	Ke ne ke hlile ke khona ho kena ho eona.
Now that is gone.	Jwale seo se ile.
He did very well.	O entse hantle haholo.
As he once did.	Joalo ka ha a kile a etsa.
There are so many.	Ho na le tse ngata haholo.
I'm not sure how old he was when he wrote it.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na o ne a le lilemo li kae ha a ne a e ngola.
However, we humans continue to do so.	Leha ho le joalo, rōna batho re tsoela pele ho e etsa.
When you go out at night.	Ha u tsoa bosiu.
They did not know at all.	Ho hang ba ne ba sa tsebe.
It says it was too much.	E re e ne e le ngata haholo.
Some children can learn.	Bana ba bang ba ka ithuta.
They seemed to understand him.	Ba ne ba bonahala ba mo utloisisa.
It works well now.	E sebetsa hantle hona joale.
Sometimes.	Ka nako e 'ngoe.
My point is that it is not what it is going to take.	Taba ea ka ke hore ha se seo e tlang ho se nka.
Why do I need to do this?	Ke hobane'ng ha ho hlokahala hore ke etse see?
But it looks good to me.	Empa e shebahala hantle ho nna.
I think you should think about this.	Ke nahana hore o lokela ho nahana ka sena.
That's not why we're here.	Ha se lebaka leo re leng mona ka lona.
I could do nothing.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho etsa letho.
And that's it.	Mme ke seo.
You don't even know the dog.	Ha o tsebe le ntja.
I did not understand it.	Ke ne ke sa e utloisise.
It was real.	E ne e le ntho ea sebele.
If anyone can find him you can find him.	Haeba mang kapa mang a ka mo fumana u ka mo fumana.
I needed strength.	Ke ne ke hloka matla.
That's all you need.	Ke tsohle tseo o li batlang.
I was in so much pain.	Ke ne ke utloa bohloko haholo.
I too did not see the one coming.	Le 'na ha kea ka ka bona eo a tlang.
We can do anything for you.	Re ka u etsetsa eng kapa eng.
Or tomorrow.	Kapa hosane.
I don't know what that means.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hoo ho bolela eng.
Not sure what it is.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na ke efe.
Please come with us.	Ke kopa o tsamaee le rona.
I did not take.	Ha kea ka ka nka.
We found nothing.	Ha rea ​​ka ra fumana letho.
There are more than ever before.	Ho na le tse ngata ho feta leha e le neng pele.
I do not see you every day.	Ha ke u bone letsatsi le letsatsi.
Forget it.	Ho e lebala.
However, he did not do so.	Leha ho le joalo ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
It should be fun now.	E lokela ho ba e monate hona joale.
Some do not want to look at the picture.	Ba bang ha ba batle ho sheba setšoantšo.
They are more difficult to do.	Li thata ho feta ho li etsa.
The fact is, you can.	'Nete ke hore u ka khona.
Is it still there?	E ntse e le teng?
Just think of yourself.	Nahana ka uena feela.
However, there seemed to be no way out.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho bonahala ho se letho le ka etsang joalo.
And it works very well.	'Me e sebetsa hantle haholo.
It was a very sad thing because.	E ne e le ntho e bohloko haholo hobane.
But he knew that.	Empa o ne a tseba seo.
Do whatever you decide to do as soon as you can.	Etsa eng kapa eng eo u etsang qeto ea ho e etsa kapele kamoo u ka khonang.
Always make sure you save water.	Kamehla etsa bonnete ba hore u boloka metsi.
I hope it has been good for you.	Ke tšepa hore ho bile molemo ho uena.
No one spoke.	Haho motho ya ileng a bua.
We did not do those things or think too much of them.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa lintho tseo kapa ra nahana haholo ka tsona.
Someone tell her.	E mong a mo bolelle.
I usually do that.	Hangata ke etsa joalo.
Breakfast is a very important meal - it can either make or break your day.	Lijo tsa hoseng ke lijo tsa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa tsa letsatsi.
I can't imagine life without him.	Ha ke khone ho nahana bophelo ntle le eena.
Yes, that's a bad thing.	E, hoo ke ntho e mpe.
Do not tell them anything.	O se ke wa ba bolella letho.
But they obviously did.	Empa ho hlakile hore ba ile ba etsa joalo.
Think of all the things you can do.	Nahana ka lintho tsohle tseo u ka li etsang.
I couldn’t keep coming back to that.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho lula ke khutlela ho seo.
That makes it difficult.	Seo se etsa hore ho be thata.
It was easy to do.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho e etsa.
I have no idea how these children felt.	Ho hang ha ke tsebe hore na bana bana ba ne ba ikutloa joang.
You did everything you could.	U entse sohle seo u neng u ka se khona.
I am so tired of being strong for everyone.	Ke khathetse haholo ke ho ba matla bakeng sa bohle.
Maybe he would talk to her.	Mohlomong o ne a tla bua le eena.
He hoped he would understand.	O ne a tšepa hore o tla utloisisa.
I have to agree.	Ke tlameha ho lumela.
They were working on it.	Ba ne ba sebetsa ho eona.
He became even more indifferent.	O ile a qala ho se tsotelle le ho feta.
She was the first girl in her class.	E ne e le ngoanana oa pele sehlopheng sa hae.
This can take a very long time.	Sena se ka nka nako e telele haholo.
I don't know much about him.	Ha ke tsebe hakaalo ka eena.
He could not do this for long.	O ne a sa khone ho etsa sena ka nako e telele.
I live at home with them.	Ke lula hae le bona.
Can you imagine that.	Na o ka nahana seo.
Some say, but be aware of this.	Ba bang ba re, empa hlokomela sena.
I was his wife before.	Ke ne ke le mosali oa hae pele.
And the problem was with my mother.	'Me bothata e ne e le bona ho 'Mè.
But we need our place.	Empa re hloka sebaka sa rona.
I like their opinion now.	Ke rata maikutlo a bona hona joale.
It is very important to me.	E bohlokoa haholo ho 'na.
He could have used the help of the police.	O ne a ka sebelisa thuso ea mapolesa.
You forget it tonight.	U e lebala bosiung bona.
But we do not have time now.	Empa ha re na nako hona joale.
These are.	Tsena ke.
However, I would be better off.	Leha ho le joalo, nka ba ea molemo.
We stayed a week and the place was nice.	Re ile ra lula beke 'me sebaka se setle.
There is no such opportunity.	Ha ho na monyetla o joalo.
This must be a priority.	Sena e tlameha ho ba sona se tlang pele.
Read what happened here.	Bala se etsahetseng mona.
However, I still love this technique.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ntse ke rata mokhoa ona.
They really care about him as one of their own.	Ba mo hlokomela e le ka sebele joaloka e mong oa bona.
Delicious and tasty food.	Lijo tse monate le tse monate.
He was in serious danger.	O ne a le kotsing e lekaneng.
We must understand this.	Re tlameha ho utloisisa sena.
That's for that.	Ke bakeng sa seo.
He knows we are here.	O a tseba hore re mona.
It just makes me that way.	E mpa e etsa hore ke be joalo.
However, it did not provide.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ea ka ea fana.
He just needed to be where you were.	O ne a hloka feela ho ba sebakeng seo o neng o le ho sona.
Again, he asked her the same question.	Hape, o ile a mo botsa potso e tšoanang.
I will tell you it once again.	Ke tla u bolella eona hang hape.
Often no one was there.	Hangata ho ne ho se motho.
You did it.	U ne u e entse.
It is actually the same image.	Ha e le hantle ke setšoantšo se tšoanang.
This is a very important issue.	Ena ke taba ea bohlokoa haholo.
Obviously I like the latter.	Ho hlakile hore ke rata ho qetela.
And no children.	'Me ha ho bana.
He could have done better.	O ne a ka etsa betere.
Can the car move faster?	Na koloi eo e ka tsamaea kapele?
When he passed people, there was no one in his group.	Ha a feta batho, ho ne ho se motho sehlopheng sa hae.
Very first day.	Letsatsi la pele haholo.
But time caught up with us.	Empa nako e ile ea re tšoara.
I do not believe that life can go on this way.	Ha ke lumele hore bophelo bo ka tsoela pele ka tsela ena.
I need a new way.	Ke hloka tsela e ncha.
This is the approach we will take.	Ena ke mokhoa oo re tla o nka.
Make sure you have friends.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u na le metsoalle.
He will tell me either way.	O tla mpolella ka tsela efe kapa efe.
Human life is human life.	Bophelo ba motho ke bophelo ba motho.
It's work time.	Ke nako ea mosebetsi.
Be a man with it.	Eba monna ka eona.
But it is too late.	Empa nako e se e le morao haholo.
It may be difficult to let someone else go first.	Ho ka 'na ha e-ba thata ho lumella motho e mong hore a tsamaee pele.
He rejected them.	O ile a ba hana.
He could stand.	O ne a ka ema.
I just hoped it wasn't ours.	Ke ne ke tšepa feela hore e ne e se ea rona.
That is his style of play.	Eo ke mokhoa oa hae oa ho bapala.
You do not have to feel this way.	Ha ua lokela ho ikutloa ka tsela ena.
Police were able to arrest him	Mapolesa a ile a khona ho tšoara
He had power.	O ne a ena le matla.
I know what people like to drink.	Ke tseba seo batho ba se ratang ho noa.
The girl was looking for someone.	Ngoanana eo o ne a ntse a batla motho.
Make sure both parents are present.	Etsa bonnete ba hore batsoali ka bobeli ba teng.
He wants to live again.	O batla ho phela hape.
Eventually he will fall asleep.	Qetellong o tla robala.
It was not a very nice place.	E ne e se sebaka se setle haholo.
This gets good things in advance.	Sena se fumana lintho tse ntle esale pele.
There is a better way.	Ho na le tsela e betere.
However, I do not.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke etse joalo.
His team is waiting for their turn.	Sehlopha sa hae se emetse nako ea bona.
It was a thing of the past.	E ne e le ntho ya nako e fetileng.
But he was not an expert.	Empa e ne e se setsebi.
I did not want this.	Ke ne ke sa batle sena.
Use only one time.	Sebelisa nako e le 'ngoe feela.
It was that they were very powerful.	E ne e le hore ba ne ba le matla haholo.
That's the last time we really talked.	Ke lekhetlo la ho qetela re hlile re bua.
He had a good team.	O ne a e-na le sehlopha sa tse ntle.
He is a sweet dog.	Ke ntja e monate.
He often fell asleep early.	Hangata o ne a robala kapele.
There is a sense in which we are one family.	Ho na le maikutlo a hore re lelapa le le leng.
Or maybe just like that, as it were.	Kapa mohlomong joalo ka eona, joalo ka ha ho le joalo.
He was strong.	O ne a le matla.
He must have known.	E tlameha ebe o ne a tseba.
You may find this helpful.	U ka fumana sena se thusa.
Then they would consume him.	Joale ba ne ba tla mo qeta.
But there are still problems.	Empa ho ntse ho e-na le mathata.
I think it will work.	Ke nahana hore e tla sebetsa.
My kids love going there.	Bana ba ka ba rata ho ea moo.
He looked like him, moreover.	O ne a shebahala joaloka eena, ho feta moo.
But, in the end, he had to go to work.	Empa, qetellong, o ile a tlameha ho ya sebetsa.
I felt like I did too.	Ke ile ka ikutloa joaloka 'na hape.
Forget about having sex with him.	Lebala hore na ho joang ho robala le eena.
He cared for us very much.	O ne a re hlokomela haholo.
I don't care, really.	Ha ke tsotelle, ka 'nete.
They did not deserve it.	Ba ne ba sa lokela.
Start meeting.	Qala ho kopana.
He obviously did not have it.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a se na eona.
I had no idea what it was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke eng.
He wanted nothing more than that.	O ne a sa batle letho ho feta moo.
Love that too.	Rata le seo.
Unless it does not do so for some reason.	Ntle le hore ha e etse joalo ka lebaka le itseng.
I belong to everyone.	Ke ea bohle.
Baby before you go.	Ngoana pele u ntse u tsamaea.
We go through it.	Re feta ho eona.
Bosiu,	Bosiu,
But no one will ever know.	Empa ha ho motho ea tla tseba seo.
Watching the news.	Ho shebella litaba.
He’s a doctor, after all.	Ke ngaka, ka mor'a tsohle.
Last week, he had a big party.	Bekeng e fetileng, o ile a etsa mokete o moholo.
But my father, who was driving, was not there.	Empa ntate, ea neng a khanna, ha a eo.
As he says so.	Ha a ntse a bua joalo.
It's a long way to go, don't you think?	Ke tsela e telele ho tsamaea, ha u nahane?
I think it made him think.	Ke nahana hore e ile ea etsa hore a nahane.
Here is how the technique worked.	Mona ke kamoo mokhoa oo o ileng oa sebetsa kateng.
All that money.	Chelete eo kaofela.
However, it does not go far enough.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e ea pele.
Your job was hard.	Mosebetsi oa hau e ne e le o boima.
I have to get in and out.	Ke tlameha ho kena le ho tsoa.
Everyone here knows it.	Bohle ba mona ba e tseba.
He said he did not even know why.	O ile a re ha a tsebe le hore na ke hobane'ng.
My child is working very hard.	Ngoana oa ka o sebetsa ka thata haholo.
This condition has no real effect.	Boemo bona ha bo na matla a sebele.
We became friends.	Re ile ra ba metsoalle.
Not every thought is good.	Ha se mohopolo o mong le o mong o motle.
He wasn't sure if it was his calling job or something else.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke mosebetsi oa hae oa ho letsetsa kapa ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I did nothing wrong.	Ha kea etsa letho le phoso.
Maybe I can't take him.	Mohlomong ha ke khone ho mo nka.
This is exactly what we would expect.	Sena ke sona seo re neng re ka se lebella.
However, there is only one girl he wants to talk to.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le ngoanana a le mong feela eo a batlang ho bua le eena.
But it is still not news.	Empa e ntse e se litaba.
I tried a second one.	Ke ile ka leka ea bobeli.
But it is really weird.	Empa ehlile ke ntho e makatsang.
And some do not.	Le ba bang ha ba etse joalo.
The teacher asked for one thing.	Tichere ena e ile ea kōpa ntho e le ’ngoe.
He passed.	O ile a feta.
I was here before.	Ke ne ke le mona pele.
People like to feel good about themselves and what they do.	Batho ba rata ho ikutloa ba le motle ka bona le seo ba se etsang.
Apparently the dog had no other health problems.	Ho bonahala eka ntja e ne e se na mathata a mang a bophelo.
You know, this can be very helpful.	Ua tseba, sena se ka ba molemo haholo.
I know more than anyone what work means to you.	Ke tseba ho feta mang kapa mang hore na mosebetsi o bolela eng ho uena.
You usually see one before or after the other.	Hangata u bona e 'ngoe pele kapa ka morao ho e 'ngoe.
We needed money.	Re ne re hloka chelete.
Telling the group that he does not need help.	Ho bolella sehlopha hore ha a hloke thuso.
It doesn't matter much.	Ha ho na taba e ngata.
It continues in the room	E tsoela pele ka kamoreng
It has made any of us.	E entse leha e le mang oa rona.
I found it very easy to use.	Ke fumane ho le bonolo haholo ho e sebelisa.
He likes to travel a lot.	O rata ho tsamaea haholo.
Exactly so.	Hantle joalo.
To do the work for you.	Ho u etsetsa mosebetsi.
It was so beautiful.	E ne e le ntle haholo.
It's a fun job.	Ke mosebetsi o monate.
Yes, he did.	Ee, o e bone joale.
He gives His power to all of us.	O fana ka matla a hae ho rona bohle.
You want her to know how much you love her.	U batla hore a tsebe hore na u mo rata hakae.
Mary, decide.	Mary, etsa qeto.
This is easy.	Sena se bonolo.
I have breakfast.	Ke ja lijo tsa hoseng.
And that's not my business.	Mme ha se taba ya ka eo.
My parents met her and loved her very much.	Batsoali ba ka ba kopane le eena 'me ba mo rata haholo.
He had no water.	O ne a sena metsi.
It's not too late for you now.	Ha e-so be morao haholo ho uena joale.
I saw someone.	Ke bone motho.
It's happening.	E ntse e etsahala.
It is not necessary, because today it means everything.	Ha ho hlokahale, hobane kajeno e bolela tsohle.
There seemed to be nothing more I could say.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na tse ngata tseo nka li buang.
One of my favorites.	E 'ngoe ea tseo ke li ratang.
You will not like this content.	U ke ke ua rata litaba tsena.
What kind of food do you like?	U rata lijo tsa mofuta ofe?
This is not a problem, though.	Sena ha se bothata, leha ho le joalo.
Obviously I didn’t think it worked.	Ho hlakile hore ke ne ke sa nahane hore e sebetsa.
Think about the many things you do regularly.	Nahana ka lintho tse ngata tseo u li etsang kamehla.
He is here for a reason.	O mona ka lebaka.
I want you to speak for me.	Ke batla hore o bue bakeng sa ka.
One is new.	E 'ngoe ke e ncha.
Know it for sure.	E tsebe ka bonnete.
It did not take.	Ha hoa ka ha nka.
He lives nearby.	O lula haufi.
It was a high school thing.	E ne e le ntho ea sekolo se phahameng.
This does not seem to be the case.	Sena ha se bonahale se le joalo.
You can't betray someone harder and faster than that.	U ke ke ua eka motho ka thata le kapele ho feta moo.
You can see it today.	Le ka e bona kajeno.
I almost heard you think.	Ke ne ke batla ke utloa o nahana.
I would never have thought of that opportunity.	Ke ne ke sa tlo nahana le ka monyetla oo.
But you do not.	Empa uena ha u etse joalo.
They did nothing.	Ha ba ka ba etsa letho.
The truth was, yes.	'Nete e ne e le, e.
And we should want to keep him.	'Me re lokela ho batla ho mo boloka.
I'll get there.	Ke tla fihla teng.
The first is to spend a lot of time outside.	Ea pele ke ho qeta nako e ngata ka ntle.
Without water, humans would not survive.	Ntle le metsi, batho ba ke ke ba phela.
His family had it.	Lelapa la hae le ne le e-na le eona.
So it was with my family.	Le lelapa la ka le ne le le joalo.
But we did.	Empa re ile ra etsa joalo.
It's a thought.	Ke mohopolo.
At that time we had just met him.	Ka nako eo re ne re sa tsoa kopana le eena.
Still, they were suffering.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba ntse ba utloa bohloko.
However, at first it does not seem so.	Leha ho le joalo, ka lekhetlo la pele ha ho bonahale ho le joalo.
I, thank you.	Ke, kea leboha.
I did not know how to do this.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ho etsa sena.
No one mentions your name.	Ha ho na motho ea buang ka lebitso la hau.
Someone had to tell the truth about what happened.	Motho e mong o ne a lokela ho bua ’nete ka se etsahetseng.
However, he also said nothing.	Leha ho le joalo, le eena o ne a sa bue letho.
Pick it up for what matters.	E nke bakeng sa seo e leng sa bohlokoa.
I want you to think about tomorrow.	Ke batla hore u nahane ka hosane.
He says so.	O bua joalo.
That's what makes them kids.	Ke sona se etsang hore e be bana.
Fact and reality.	'Nete le maikutlo a sebele.
Some do not care.	Ba bang ha ba tsotelle.
He doesn't want a party or anything.	Ha a batle mokete kapa letho.
They ask everyone, from house to house.	Ba botsa motho e mong le e mong, ntlo le ntlo.
This was happening.	Sena se ne se ntse se etsahala.
She was so beautiful.	O ne a le motle haholo.
It can be incredibly important and surprisingly dangerous.	E ka ba ea bohlokoa ka tsela e makatsang le e kotsi ka mokhoa o makatsang.
But no, thank you.	Empa che, kea leboha.
I knew it wouldn't work.	Ke ne ke tseba hore e ke ke ea sebetsa.
Tomorrow do something.	Hosane etsa se seng.
I would let him think so, though.	Ke ne ke tla mo lumella hore a nahane joalo, leha ho le joalo.
They know it's coming.	Ba a tseba hore e a tla.
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le joalo.
It could not.	E ne e ke ke ea etsa joalo.
I have them.	Ke na le tsona.
I seem to have a lot to say.	Ke bonahala ke na le lintho tse ngata tseo nka li buang.
They would have to leave.	Ba ne ba tla tlameha ho tsamaea.
It was, he thought.	E ne e le eona, a nahana.
We are doing just that.	Re ntse re etsa joalo hantle.
They were so grateful, you could have seen them.	Ba ne ba leboha haholo, o ka be o ba bone.
Everything was not going well.	Tsohle li ne li sa tsamaee hantle.
Money is not everything, you know.	Chelete ha se ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe, ua tseba.
Leave room for it.	Tlohela sebaka bakeng sa eona.
He could not believe that he was hearing this.	O ne a sa lumele hore o utloa sena.
In one place.	Sebakeng se le seng.
The people were very grateful.	Batho ba ne ba leboha haholo.
Stay with us for it.	Lula le rona bakeng sa eona.
And we had a wonderful time.	Mme re bile le nako e monate.
It is good to have friends.	Ke ntho e ntle ho ba le metsoalle.
I plan to go in with him first thing in the morning.	Ke rera ho kena le eena ntho ea pele hoseng.
This is easier said than done.	Sena se bonolo ho se bua ho feta ho se etsa.
But there is a problem with that.	Empa ho na le bothata ka seo.
The fear of life is actually the fear of emotions.	Ho tšaba bophelo ha e le hantle ke ho tšaba maikutlo.
People don't know these things, it seems.	Batho ha ba tsebe litaba tsena, ho bonahala.
It was long, but not long enough.	E ne e le telele, empa e se nako e lekaneng.
I will leave you.	Ke tla o tlohela.
Maybe he will win, he thought.	Mohlomong o tla hlola, a nahana joalo.
We did not know.	Re ne re sa tsebe.
If the kids did it at home, you got them.	Haeba bana ba e entse ba le hae, u ba fumane.
I thought this method would work.	Ke ne ke nahana hore tsela ena e tla sebetsa.
You both look so happy.	Ka bobeli le shebahala le thabile haholo.
If not you can try another one now.	Haeba ho se joalo u ka leka e 'ngoe hona joale.
But that was not the case.	Empa e ne e se hoo.
Picture this week.	Setšoantšo sa beke ena.
They looked good in the front.	Ba ne ba shebahala hantle ka pele.
You can stay at my house.	U ka lula ha ka.
So he knew what was going on.	Kahoo o ne a tseba se etsahalang.
He could not use his strength.	O ne a sa khone ho sebelisa matla a hae.
But that is what they did.	Empa ke seo ba se entseng.
I am sure we will.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore re tla etsa joalo.
He did not get it.	Ha aa ka a e fumana.
So this morning.	Joalo hoseng hona.
That is good news.	Ke litaba tse monate tseo.
And making money.	Le ho etsa chelete.
Man cannot be whatever he wants to be.	Motho e ke ke ea e-ba ntho leha e le efe eo a e batlang.
That is exactly what is happening here.	Ruri ke sona se etsahalang mona.
Some people didn’t think he should do it.	Batho ba bang ba ne ba sa nahane hore o lokela ho e etsa.
But one more thing.	Empa ntho e 'ngoe hape.
You did not know.	U ne u sa tsebe.
Then good news for you.	Ebe litaba tse monate ho uena.
He will need his strength.	O tla hloka matla a hae.
Things were like that.	Lintho li ne li le joalo.
That is one of the most important steps I can take.	Ke mokhoa o mong oa bohlokoa haholo oo ke o etsang.
You probably know.	Mohlomong ua tseba.
We ate.	Re ile ra ja.
It takes a long time, we found.	Ho nka nako e telele, re fumane.
I am just a child.	Ke ngoana feela.
I know so much about you to be honest.	Ke tseba joalo ka uena ho bua 'nete.
So, it was not difficult at all.	Kahoo, ho ne ho se thata ho hang.
It was not his place.	E ne e se sebaka sa hae.
It was a fun time, but very lonely.	E ne e le nako e monate, empa e le bolutu haholo.
He didn't care.	O ne a sa tsotelle letho.
She noticed that she was busy with her homework.	O ile a hlokomela hore o ne a phathahane ka mosebetsi oa hae oa sekolo.
However, he refused to say when.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a hana ho bolela hore na ke neng.
Thank you very much.	Ke e leboha haholo.
We will always play and we will play hard.	Re tla lula re bapala 'me re tla bapala ka thata.
He refused to eat or drink.	O ile a hana ho ja kapa ho noa.
Easy.	Lula.
We should do all we can.	Re lokela ho etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
He came to me.	O ile a tla ho nna.
I want to see you.	Ke batla ho u bona.
Use any of this time.	Sebelisa nako efe kapa efe ea nako ena.
I can't go there now.	Ha ke khone ho ea moo hona joale.
I told her before.	Ke mo boleletse pele.
Somehow, of course, but he would come back.	Ka mokhoa o mong, ho hlakile, empa o ne a tla khutla.
We would be happy.	Re ka be re thabile.
You have to understand more than that.	U tlameha ho utloisisa haholo ho feta moo.
I'd like to speak with you.	Ke kopa ho bua le uena.
I also did not agree.	Le ’na ha kea ka ka lumela.
If so, you obviously did not know him well.	Haeba ho joalo, ho hlakile hore o ne a sa mo tsebe hantle.
You have a lot of questions, don't you?	U na le lipotso tse ngata, na ha ho joalo?
That is the only time.	Ke eona feela nako eo.
He did not want to tell anyone.	O ne a sa batle ho bolella motho.
But he is still learning.	Empa o ntse a ithuta.
What matters to me may not be important to you or it may not matter.	Se bohlokoa ho 'na se ka ba sa bohlokoa ho uena kapa ha se na taba.
However, those things happened.	Leha ho le joalo, lintho tseo li ile tsa etsahala.
We have to look at what is in front of us.	Re tlameha ho sheba se ka pele ho rona.
We have a lot in common.	Re na le lintho tse ngata tseo re tšoanang ka tsona.
And you never talk to them again.	Mme ha o sa bua le bona hape.
He used to play all the time at the time.	O ne a tloaetse ho bapala ka linako tsohle ka nako eo.
What was there, is still there.	Se neng se le teng, se ntse se le teng.
It wasn't easy, but he did.	Ho ne ho se bonolo, empa o ile a etsa joalo.
But they were close.	Empa ba ne ba le haufi.
The question is what to do next.	Potso ke hore na u lokela ho etsa eng ka mor'a moo.
He stood there.	A ema moo.
Thank you for a great job!	Kea leboha ka mosebetsi o motle!
I decided to keep doing it.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho tsoela pele ho e etsa.
thank you	kea leboha
He does an amazing job.	O etsa mosebetsi o makatsang.
It went beyond that.	Ho ile ha feta moo.
Be an important person now.	Eba motho oa bohlokoa hona joale.
And while you are still there.	Mme e re o ntse o le teng.
He could not think of a reason why he wanted to talk to them.	O ne a sa nahane hore na ke hobane’ng ha a batla ho bua le bona.
However, it is necessary to use another method.	Leha ho le joalo, hoa hlokahala ho sebelisa mokhoa o mong.
He knew how to get out of this place.	O ne a tseba tsela ea ho tsoa sebakeng sena.
But it remains to be seen.	Empa ho sa ntse ho tla bonahala.
I do not know how we met.	Ha ke tsebe hore na re kopane joang.
And you can have them.	'Me u ka ba le tsona.
That's the only way to get in.	Ke eona feela tsela ea ho kena.
I want him to think about my question.	Ke batla hore a nahane ka potso ea ka.
You just need to be yourself.	U hloka feela ho ba uena.
This issue has been around for a long time.	Taba ena esale e le teng ka nako e telele.
He thought the car belonged to my boyfriend.	O ne a nka hore koloi eo ke ea mohlankana oa ka.
Sleep well.	Robala hantle.
However, it was strange.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
I can't find him.	Ha ke mo fumane.
Money does not matter to him.	Chelete ha e na taba ho eena.
I take a lot of his time.	Ke nka nako ea hae e ngata haholo.
It does not mix.	Ha e kopane.
I hope this can help.	Ke tšepa hore sena se ka thusa.
Which is very bad.	E leng mpe haholo.
We think we do, but we don't.	Re nahana hore re etsa joalo, empa ha re etse joalo.
They speak, and they do not, of our lives.	Li bua, 'me ha li joalo, ka bophelo ba rona.
We just make enough money every day at a time.	Re mpa re etsa chelete e lekaneng letsatsi ka leng ka nako.
Also trust your mind.	Hape tšepa kelello ea hau.
It seems impossible to understand how this can be a problem.	Ho bonahala eka ha ho bonolo ho utloisisa hore na sena se ka ba bothata joang.
It is useless last year.	Ha ho na thuso selemong se fetileng.
He did it before.	O kile a e etsa pele.
I can do it alone.	Nka e etsa ke le mong.
Maybe us.	Mohlomong rona.
We wanted her to know how much we loved her.	Re ne re batla hore a tsebe hore na re mo rata hakae.
No, he would take a chance.	Che, o ne a tla nka monyetla.
It was just mental matters.	E ne e le litaba tsa kelello feela.
The things they said they thought he could apply.	Lintho tseo ba li buileng ba ne ba nahana hore a ka li sebelisa.
Make sure they eat breakfast.	Etsa bonnete ba hore ba ja lijo tsa hoseng.
Sometimes things hurt.	Ka linako tse ling lintho tse bohloko.
And then we will see something very interesting.	Mme hape re tla bona ntho e monate haholo.
It is not.	Ha se eona.
Anyone who went through that would have trouble trusting it.	Mang kapa mang ea fetileng ho seo o ne a tla ba le mathata a ho tšepa.
However they decided to do so.	Leha ho le joalo ba ile ba etsa qeto ea ho etsa joalo.
I mean, exactly like.	Ke bolela, hantle joalo ka.
Of course, that too could be significant.	Ho hlakile hore seo le sona e ka ba sa bohlokoa.
What is happening to me? 	Ho etsahala'ng ka 'na?
he thought.	a nahana.
I heard everything they said.	Ke utloile tsohle tseo ba li buang.
You agree to repair your car.	O lumela ho lokisa koloi ea hau.
She sat back.	A dula morao.
The bottom line is that they both look good.	Taba ea bohlokoa ke hore ka bobeli ba shebahala hantle.
You know you love it.	Ua tseba hore ua e rata.
I had no power here.	Ke ne ke se na matla mona.
It will do nothing.	E ke ke ea etsa letho.
I can help.	Nka thusa.
None of us knew how it would go.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a tseba hore na ho ne ho tla tsamaea joang.
You are better than I am.	O betere ho nna ho mpheta.
Then you can enter.	Joale u ka kena.
I didn't think much of it.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hakaalo ka eona.
That's a lot to me.	Ke ntho e ngata ho nna.
He would have to leave it there.	O ne a tla tlameha ho e tlohela moo.
But matters were more important.	Empa litaba e ne e le tsona tsa bohlokoa.
You can talk to the police.	U ka bua le mapolesa.
I was able to do it.	Ke ile ka khona ho e etsa.
I just know it, that's all.	Kea e tseba feela, ke tsohle.
He would know what to do.	O ne a tla tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
I never thought about shoes.	Ha kea ka ka nahana ka lieta.
He will surely return.	Ka sebele o tla khutla.
What you said at the time was interesting.	Seo u se buileng ka nako eo se ne se le monate.
I don't have to wonder.	Ha kea lokela ho ipotsa.
He looked good in the area.	O ne a shebahala hantle sebakeng.
Write your question again.	Ngola potso ea hau hape.
It may not have been, and he would not have been.	E ka 'na eaba ho ne ho se joalo, 'me o ne a tla be a se joalo.
I will try anything at once.	Ke tla leka eng kapa eng hang.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
This, of course, is exactly what.	Sena, ha e le hantle, ke sona seo.
I tried to hear her point.	Ke ile ka leka ho utloa maikutlo a hae.
He's just great.	O moholo feela.
Sometimes both at the same time.	Ka linako tse ling ka bobeli ka nako e le 'ngoe.
It does not go well.	Ha e tsamaee hantle.
It would be nice if it could, but it is not.	Ho ka ba monate ha e ka etsa joalo, empa ha ho joalo.
He said it quickly.	O ile a e bua kapele.
It doesn't matter in the end.	Ha ho na taba qetellong.
It was to stay.	E ne e le ea ho lula.
We can't find it.	Ha re khone ho e fumana.
You speak well of me, you speak well of yourself.	O bolela hantle ka nna, o bolela hantle ka wena.
No one knew we had ever been there.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba hore re kile ra ba teng.
You do what you have to do.	U etsa seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
This is too close.	Sena se haufi haholo.
Think about how long it has been.	Nahana hore na e bile nako e kae.
It knows when to stop and when to stop.	E tseba nako ea ho ema le ho ema.
Nothing was happening.	Ho ne ho se letho le etsahalang.
This strange room.	Kamore e makatsang ena.
This is a very strange idea.	Ena ke mohopolo o makatsang haholo.
That's a good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle eo.
But, boy, he did it.	Empa, moshanyana, o o entse.
That's easy !.	Ho bonolo hoo!.
I really didn't want anything.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa batle letho.
This can take several hours.	Sena se ka nka lihora tse 'maloa.
They will see you for who you are.	Ba tla o bona ka seo o leng sona.
Then we do.	Ebe rea etsa.
You really should go.	Ka sebele u lokela ho tsamaea.
That’s what your style is.	Ke seo mokhoa oa hau o leng sona.
They sleep with friends.	Ba robala le metsoalle.
He wondered how we would survive without him	O ne a ipotsa hore na re tla khona joang ntle le eena
She plans to write a book.	O rera ho ngola buka.
There was something that could be dangerous in what they were doing.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho e ka 'nang ea e-ba kotsi ho seo ba neng ba se etsa.
It is real life.	Ke bophelo ba sebele.
Everything is nothing.	Tsohle hase letho.
We were just trying to survive.	Re ne re mpa re leka ho phela.
Many are standing with him.	Ba bangata ba ema le eena.
I speak and write for them.	Ke bua le ho ngola bakeng sa bona.
Yes, this is a lot to ask.	E, sena ke lintho tse ngata tseo u lokelang ho li botsa.
My people.	Batho ba ka.
He made a decision for you, and for me.	O entse qeto bakeng sa hao, le bakeng sa ka.
I really like it.	Ruri ke e rata.
Obviously this is not appropriate.	Ho hlakile hore sena ha sea lokela.
He loves us.	O a re rata.
She is tired of being treated like a child.	O khathetse ke ho tšoaroa joalo ka ngoana.
This car is mine.	Koloi ena ke ea ka.
It is easy to say that.	Ho bonolo ho bua joalo.
I found out about that like last week.	Ke ile ka fumana ka seo jwalo ka beke e fetileng.
There is just so much more to come.	Ho na le tse ngata feela tse lokelang ho ba teng.
You decide because he is your dog.	U etsa qeto hobane ke ntja ea hau.
He does not love us.	Ha a re rate.
I want to work hard and play hard.	Ke batla ho sebetsa ka thata le ho bapala ka thata.
We must live it.	Re tlameha ho e phela .
I know his name.	Ke tseba lebitso la hae.
I would love to get home.	Ke tla thabela ho fihla hae.
She was wonderful.	O bile monate.
You want to do this today.	U batla ho etsa sena kajeno.
Then he looked for more water.	Eaba o batla metsi a mang.
Of course, often, often.	Ha e le hantle, hangata, hangata.
It was not her fault.	E ne e se molato oa hae.
To be honest, you never asked.	Ho bua 'nete, ha ua ka ua botsa.
Note that this goes on and on.	Hlokomela hore sena se tsoela pele ho feta.
Finally and here and now.	Qetellong le hona mona le hona joale.
You need to work on it.	U hloka ho e sebetsa.
Because they seem to know better than I do.	Hobane ba bonahala ba tseba ho mpheta.
Like his father, he thought.	Joaloka ntate oa hae, o ile a nahana.
The woman is not there.	Mosali ha a eo.
In a sense, it is the same here.	Ka tsela e itseng, ho joalo le mona.
I was about to say the same thing about you.	Ke ne ke le haufi le ho bua ntho e tšoanang ka uena.
It is easy to know when you are not there.	Ho bonolo ho tseba ha u le sieo.
I need you to understand that.	Ke hloka hore o utloisise seo.
And I'm happy about that.	Mme ke thabile ka hona.
This situation is problematic.	Boemo bona ke mathata.
He may not have a home if that happens.	A ka 'na a se be le ntlo haeba seo se ka etsahala.
I'm glad to be back.	Ke thabetse ho khutla.
I am not a morning person.	Ha ke motho oa hoseng.
But he played well with others.	Empa o ne a bapala hantle le ba bang.
There are several things you can do.	Ho na le lintho tse 'maloa tseo u ka li etsang.
He almost fell in love with her.	O ne a batla a mo rata.
For me, he said.	Ka 'na, o ile a re.
It will only happen more.	Ho tla etsahala feela ho feta.
And it did not sit still.	'Me ha ea ka ea lula fatše.
I will not defeat him.	Nke ke ka mo hlola.
Many years passed when he was alone.	Ho ile ha feta lilemo tse ngata esale a le mong.
They did not enjoy it very much.	Ha baa ka ba e thabela hakaalo.
I want to give my opinion.	Ke batla ho fana ka maikutlo a ka.
It’s time for you to decide to come back.	Ke nako ea hore u etse qeto ea ho khutla.
I read at work.	Ke bala mosebetsing.
These things are dangerous.	Lintho tsena li kotsi.
I didn’t want to do anything with it.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho etsa letho ka eona.
I had to win.	Ke ne ke lokela ho hlola.
However, it does provide.	Leha ho le joalo, e fana.
He slept for several hours.	O ile a robala lihora tse 'maloa.
But that did not deter him.	Empa seo ha sea ka sa mo etsa phoso.
But no hands, either.	Empa ha ho na matsoho, le hona.
That will take time.	Seo se tla nka nako.
People often forget this.	Batho ba lebala sena hangata.
Which was missing.	E neng e le sieo.
Will you.	Na u tla.
There were no problems.	Ho ne ho se na mathata.
They are healthy, very much.	Ba phela hantle, haholo.
I did not go out looking for you.	Ha kea tsoa ho ea u batla.
At the end of the day he was tired.	Qetellong ea letsatsi o ne a khathetse.
You will not leave us.	O ke ke wa re tlohela.
Everyone seems to know everything about everyone.	Motho e mong le e mong o bonahala a tseba tsohle ka motho e mong le e mong.
That's right, if he could sleep.	Ho joalo, haeba a ne a khona ho robala.
I gave it to my husband.	Ke ile ka e fa monna oa ka.
We go through things like that.	Re feta lintho tse joalo.
Going to a party.	Ho ea moketeng.
But this was hard for him too.	Empa sena se ne se le boima le ho eena.
I want to talk about something else.	Ke batla ho bua ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
He was a man.	E ne e le motho.
You think he is a gentle man.	U nahana hore ke monna ea bonolo.
I’m not sure the person was saying the wrong thing about it.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore motho eo o ne a bolela ntho e mpe ka eona.
But this is a very good place to start.	Empa ena ke sebaka se setle haholo ho qala.
And he certainly knew how to use it.	'Me ka sebele o ne a tseba ho e sebelisa.
You're walking.	U ntse u tsamaea.
But we already know these things.	Empa re se re ntse re tseba lintho tsena.
You need it now, and you need it urgently.	Ua e hloka hona joale, 'me u e hloka kapele.
The whole point was to meet.	Taba eohle e ne e le ho kopana.
In a few years I will be myself.	Ka lilemo tse 'maloa ke tla ba 'na.
She cares for her children.	O hlokomela bana ba hae.
But that is not what it says.	Empa ha se seo e se buang.
He may not refuse.	A ka 'na a se ke a hana.
This is what Mom does.	Sena ke seo 'Mè a se etsang.
But the problem persists.	Empa bothata bona bo ntse bo tsoela pele.
That worked out very well for us.	Seo se ile sa re tsoela molemo haholo.
He is present now.	O teng hona joale.
And it was not hard to find.	'Me ho ne ho se thata ho fumana.
He didn't have to help.	O ne a sa tlameha ho thusa.
And he refused to do it.	Mme a hana ho e etsa.
You have to make sure you find a way back home again.	U tlameha ho etsa bonnete ba hore u fumana tsela ea ho khutlela hae hape.
Certainly not for me and my wife.	Ka sebele e ne e se bakeng sa ka le mosali oa ka.
Children need to love their parents.	Bana ba lokela ho rata batsoali ba bona.
They even won.	Ba bile ba hlola.
This should not have happened.	Sena se ne se sa lokela ho etsahala.
Life is so good.	Bophelo bo monate haholo.
These were the best they had ever done.	Tsena e ne e le tse ntle ka ho fetisisa tseo ba kileng ba li etsa.
I can make it better than you.	Nka e etsa betere ho o feta.
It speaks volumes.	E bua haholo.
This provides.	Sena se fana ka.
He was the only one who found her again.	Ke eena feela eo a ileng a mo fumana hape.
They soon realized that it would not be possible.	Kapele ba ile ba hlokomela hore e ke ke ea khona.
I love the way he is with his wife.	Ke rata tsela eo a leng ka eona ho mosali oa hae.
And many agree.	'Me ba bangata baa lumela.
With his help.	Ka thuso ya hae.
No, you do not know anything about the difficult subject.	Che, ha u tsebe letho ka taba e thata.
The boy was doing well.	Moshanyana o ne a sebetsa hantle.
And that, as they say, was exactly that.	Mme seo, jwalo ka ha ba bolela, e ne e le sona seo.
It is our job.	Ke mosebetsi oa rona.
I did not know why or how.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng kapa joang.
He did not do so.	Ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
I understand how you feel about the current situation.	Ke utloisisa hore na u ikutloa joang ka boemo ba hona joale.
You can find it here.	U ka e fumana mona.
I do not see why anyone would do this.	Ha ke bone lebaka leo ka lona motho a ka etsang sena.
That was not an easy task.	Eo e ne e se ntho e bonolo ho e etsa.
Instead, she nodded.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a lumela ka hlooho.
Just right.	Hantle feela.
Now I use it.	Hona joale kea e sebelisa.
Yet he did.	Leha ho le joalo ke eena ea entseng taba eo.
So far it is very easy.	Ho fihlela joale ho bonolo haholo.
I don't want to think about anything.	Ha ke batle ho nahana ka letho.
I pick up the phone and call again.	Ke nka mohala ebe ke letsa hape.
You sit down to do your work, and you are happy.	U lula fatše ho etsa mosebetsi oa hau, 'me u thabile.
She has no reason to be afraid of him.	Ha a na lebaka la ho mo tšaba.
That should fix it.	Seo se lokela ho e lokisa.
People often forget about this.	Hangata batho ba lebala ka sena.
But that is not enough for us.	Empa hoo ha ho a lekana bakeng sa rona.
My stomach hurts.	Mpa ea ka e bohloko.
Many of us have been saying this for years.	Ba bangata ba rona esale re bua sena ka lilemo tse ngata.
I will be here to meet you.	Ke tla ba mona ho tla kopana le uena.
I did not intend for you to see it.	Ke ne ke sa rera hore o e bone.
He was a boy.	E ne e le moshanyana.
It's not hard.	Ha ho thata.
He realized that he had made a serious mistake.	O ile a hlokomela hore o entse phoso e mpe haholo.
I took them together again.	Ke ile ka li nka hammoho hape.
Not many people had ever entered his room.	Ha se batho ba bangata ba kileng ba kena ka kamoreng ea hae.
Which is fine.	E leng hantle.
Her hair was still wet.	Moriri oa hae o ne o ntse o le metsi.
Mentally, it is very easy to understand.	Ka kelello, ho bonolo haholo ho e utloisisa.
The place begins to be that.	Sebaka se qala ho ba seo.
Finally, Dad speaks softly.	Qetellong, ntate o bua ka bonolo.
Thank you but no.	Kea leboha empa che.
And many children like to do it too.	Mme bana ba bangata le bona ba rata ho e etsa.
They will not be there.	Ba ke ke ba ba teng.
You may have made several friends here.	E ka 'na eaba u entse metsoalle e 'maloa mona.
He did it.	O e entse.
You must eat first.	U tlameha ho ja lijo pele.
It certainly did.	Ehlile e entse joalo.
Sometimes it was breakfast.	Ka linako tse ling e ne e le lijo tsa hoseng.
These will be important.	Tsena li tla ba tsa bohlokoa.
It is necessary.	Hoa hlokahala.
You can talk to me.	O ka bua le nna.
They could only live on what they had.	Ba ne ba ka phela feela ka seo ba nang le sona.
No, and you know why.	Ha ho joalo, 'me ua tseba hore na ke hobane'ng.
I still think of him today.	Ke sa ntse ke nahana ka eena le kajeno.
I left quickly.	Ke ile ka tsamaea kapele.
They have their way.	Ba na le tsela ea bona.
He had to go do that now.	O ne a lokela ho ya etsa seo jwale.
Maybe he was the only one.	Mohlomong e ne e le eena feela.
However, they made a mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, ba entse phoso.
I didn't even know he had a car.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe le hore o na le koloi.
They don’t care what it takes to get it.	Ha ba tsotelle hore na ho hlokahala eng ho e fumana.
There are many that will be new.	Ho na le tse ngata tse tla ba ncha.
And she was, very strong.	Mme o ne a le jwalo, a le matla haholo.
I told her to sit down.	Ke ile ka re ke lule fatše.
He worked now.	O ile a sebetsa joale.
I met my wife here.	Ke kopane le mosali oa ka mona.
Money stands here.	Chelete e ema mona.
That is, of course.	Ke hore, ka sebele.
But it is still early.	Empa e sa le hoseng.
You do not have them.	Ha u na tsona.
Something else is just important.	Ntho e 'ngoe ke ea bohlokoa feela.
That's the way it is now.	Ke kamoo ho leng ka teng hona joale.
It was real, like life.	E ne e le 'nete, joalo ka bophelo.
They know it.	Ba e tseba.
There were three problems with this.	Ho ne ho e-na le mathata a mararo ka sena.
It would take a lot of time.	Ho ne ho tla nka nako e ngata.
A boy can have a good idea.	Moshanyana a ka ba le mohopolo o motle.
Everyone should know this.	E mong le e mong o lokela ho tseba sena.
You need more.	U hloka ho feta.
They came to work very early in the morning and stayed up late.	Ba ile ba tla mosebetsing hoseng haholo 'me ba lula bosiu haholo.
He really did not want to be here.	O ne a hlile a sa batle ho ba mona.
No one likes to think about it.	Ha ho motho ea ratang ho nahana ka eona.
You got it.	U e fumane.
There was no way he was here.	Ho ne ho se kamoo a neng a le teng mona.
I ask everything now.	Ke botsa tsohle hona joale.
See, do you want it or not.	Sheba, na ua e batla kapa che.
I'm back now.	Kea khutla joale.
Just keep going.	Tsoela pele hantle feela.
If that matters.	Haeba hoo ho bohlokoa.
Something in the room with us.	Ntho e ka kamoreng le rona.
It has to be tough.	E tlameha ho ba thata.
Everyone saw what had happened, but no one helped.	E mong le e mong o ile a bona se etsahetseng, empa ha ho ea ileng a thusa.
He certainly is.	Ruri o teng.
For someone like her, it was not easy to make friends.	Ho motho ea tšoanang le eena, ho ne ho se bonolo ho etsa metsoalle.
All the people here are like that.	Batho bohle ba mona ba joalo.
The baby started to cry.	Ngoana a qala ho lla.
Then no one spoke again.	Eaba ha ho motho ea ileng a bua hape.
So it took a long time.	Kahoo ho ile ha nka nako e telele.
And play well.	Le ho bapala hantle.
It was no longer painful.	Ho ne ho se ho se bohloko.
Of course, why not.	Ehlile, hobaneng ho se joalo.
It is a fact of life.	Ke 'nete ea bophelo.
No party does.	Ha ho mokete o etsang.
But the real problem starts here.	Empa bothata ba sebele bo qala mona.
I had a wonderful time with you.	Ke bile le nako e monate le uena.
He just went on his way.	O ile a tsoela pele feela ka tsela ea hae.
And, somehow, it was.	Mme, ka tsela e itseng, ho ne ho le jwalo.
I will go through it.	Ke tla feta ho eona.
And think of something else.	'Me u nahane ka ntho e' ngoe hape.
I suggest we take it.	Ke etsa tlhahiso ea hore re e nke.
It's really very simple.	E hlile e bonolo haholo.
I can't think of my feet.	Ha ke khone ho nahana ka maoto a ka.
Do not ask anyone to help you with your problem.	Se ke oa kopa motho e mong le e mong ho u thusa ka bothata ba hau.
He could have refused.	A ka be a ile a hana.
But you can see it.	Empa u ka e bona.
That never happened.	Hoo ha ho mohla ho kileng ha etsahala.
What it is.	Seo e leng sona.
I want to look good for her.	Ke batla ho shebahala hantle bakeng sa hae.
When is the best time to do that?	Nako e ntle ea ho etsa see ke efe?
There were too many people.	Ho ne ho e-na le batho ba bangata haholo.
Then, at last he understood what was going on.	Joale, qetellong o ile a utloisisa se etsahalang.
Sometimes a man has to sleep.	Ka linako tse ling monna o tlameha ho robala.
He said he loved her more than he loved her.	O ne a bolela hore o ne a mo rata ho mo feta.
', was'.	', e ne e le'.
He knows what the emotions have to say.	O tseba seo maikutlo a lokelang ho se bua.
When they do, it's fun.	Ha ba etsa joalo, ho monate.
But this is never enough to hold the phone.	Empa sena ha se mohla se lekaneng ho tšoara mohala.
I love him more than I say.	Ke mo rata ho feta ho bolela.
The way forward was clear.	Tsela ea ho ea pele e ne e hlakile.
But we were almost arrested at that time.	Empa re ile ra batla re tšoaroa ka nako eo.
She needs her time as a child.	O hloka nako ea hae ea ho ba ngoana.
I will call tomorrow morning.	Ke tla letsa hosane hoseng.
That's exactly right.	Ke hantle 'nete.
He went through them again.	A feta ho tsona hape.
At times, he even forgot that he was there at all.	Ka linako tse ling, o ne a lebala hore o teng ho hang.
These are things like, or.	Tsena ke lintho tse kang, kapa.
That realizes that.	Seo se hlokomela seo.
I'd like to understand it.	Ke kopa ho e utloisisa.
The book is really good.	Buka e ntle ruri.
It may not be exactly what you want.	E ka se be hantle seo o se batlang.
But soon there was another one to take its place.	Empa kapele ho ile ha e-ba le e ’ngoe e tla nka sebaka sa eona.
People are being arrested.	Batho ba ntse ba tšoaroa.
You should expect that.	O lokela ho lebella seo.
There will be no problems.	Ha ho na ho ba le mathata.
We all already know this.	Kaofela re se re tseba sena.
Your father should go on.	Ntate oa hao o lokela ho tsoela pele.
He had a house there.	O ne a ena le ntlo moo.
It's an idea.	Ke maikutlo.
No one was injured.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a tsoa kotsi.
Well, it's not fun.	Hantle, ha ho monate.
He seemed to want to tell us something.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka o batla ho re bolella ho hong.
There is nothing he can do now.	Ha ho letho leo a ka le etsang hona joale.
They actually had a lot of money on this.	Ha e le hantle ba ne ba e-na le chelete e ngata ho sena.
It was a wonderful time to be a child.	E ne e le nako e makatsang ea ho ba ngoana.
But his feelings were hurt.	Empa maikutlo a hae a ne a utloile bohloko.
You learn things as you go.	U ithuta lintho ha u ntse u tsamaea.
I could not find him.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho mo fumana.
They just tell you.	Ba o bolella feela.
I was just beginning to think of such an opportunity.	Ke ne ke qala ho nahana ka monyetla o joalo.
My mother provided a lot of food a day.	'Mè o ne a fana ka lijo tse ngata ka letsatsi.
Things go from bad to very difficult.	Lintho li tloha hantle ho ea ho tse thata haholo.
Soon, no one was talking to me.	Haufinyane, ha ho sa na motho ea buang le ’na.
I felt happy about it.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke thabile ka eona.
You have to sit down.	U tlameha ho lula fatše.
Indeed, there was.	Ka sebele, ho ne ho le teng.
And he does.	Mme o etsa jwalo.
But that is not the only reason.	Empa hase eona feela lebaka.
I had to be healthy.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho phela hantle.
I feel very strongly that you know this.	Ke ikutloa ka matla haholo hore o tseba sena.
I do not know what would happen.	Ha ke tsebe se neng se tla etsahala.
And he talked about.	Mme a bua ka.
The task was not easy.	Mosebetsi o ne o se bonolo.
It seemed dangerous.	E ne eka ke kotsi.
And it still is.	Mme ho ntse ho le jwalo.
He was unemployed and wanted to leave.	O ne a se na mosebetsi 'me a batla ho tsamaea.
Something that no one here can do.	Ntho eo ho seng motho mona ya ka e etsang.
He felt very tired.	O ne a ikutloa a 'khathetse haholo.
However, thank you again.	Leha ho le joalo, kea leboha hape.
That's it, it's not.	Ke eona, ha ho joalo.
Do not talk about the matter with him.	U se ke ua bua ka taba ea hae le eena.
No one has ever said that life is easy.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a re bophelo bo bonolo.
But to me it was, surprisingly.	Empa ho nna e ne e le, ka tsela e makatsang.
People were talking.	Batho ba ne ba bua.
It is very difficult.	Ho thata haholo.
All your life.	Bophelo bohle ba hao.
But there is something relatively new.	Empa ho na le e batlang e le ncha.
However, it is his decision, and he will do it in his own time.	Leha ho le joalo, ke qeto ea hae, 'me o tla e etsa ka nako ea hae.
In fact, they have something in common.	Ha e le hantle, ho na le ntho eo ba tšoanang ka eona.
He didn't think of it.	Ha a ka a e nahana.
They did not come out and tell me.	Ha baa ka ba tsoa 'me ba mpolella.
We'll see what happens.	Re tla bona se etsahalang.
But when she retired, she could not sleep.	Empa ha a tlohela mosebetsi o ne a sa khone ho robala.
I would be a doctor.	Ke ne ke tla ba ngaka.
I was there and did that.	Ke bile moo mme ka etsa seo.
I'm starting to use this.	Ke qala ho sebelisa sena.
He told me that he would not stay long.	O ile a mpolella hore a ke ke a lula nako e telele.
Today was our day.	Kajeno e ne e le letsatsi la rona.
I will open the subject for that.	Ke tla bula taba bakeng sa seo.
More than when they play.	Ho feta joalo ka ha ba bapala.
Do it instead of saying.	Etsa ho e-na le ho bolela.
We can certainly use it now.	Ka sebele re ka e sebelisa hona joale.
You think of something else.	U nahana tse ling hape.
They were happy to have their own room.	Ba ile ba thabela ho ba le kamore ea bona.
You come back to me.	U khutlela ho 'na.
So yes, you should visit.	Kahoo e, u lokela ho etela.
And they are.	'Me ba joalo.
It was stronger than ever.	E ne e le matla ho feta leha e le neng pele.
It's too heavy.	E boima haholo.
Then we became friends, and we probably became good friends.	Eaba re ba metsoalle, mohlomong ra ba ra ba metsoalle e molemo.
What he was going to write he did not know.	Seo a neng a tla se ngola o ne a sa se tsebe.
But he never did anything wrong.	Empa ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa letho le phoso.
I had no family.	Ke ne ke se na lelapa.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Mohlomong, mohlomong, mohlomong.
When a person leaves the room, it goes back.	Ha motho a tsoa ka phaposing, e khutlela morao.
We sat there for a long time without speaking.	Re ile ra lula joalo nako e telele re sa bue.
Nothing is too important.	Ha ho letho le bohlokoa haholo.
I need help.	Ke hloka thuso.
I did not find anything.	Ha kea fumana letho.
The dinner was delicious.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea li ne li le monate.
I consider that no.	Ke nka seo e le che.
I do not tell anyone what to believe.	Ha ke bolelle motho seo a lokelang ho se lumela.
But he is there.	Empa o teng.
I really hope he will.	Ruri ke tšepa hore o tla etsa joalo.
We know you.	Rea u tseba.
He keeps it very close to him.	O e boloka e le haufi haholo le eena.
I do not know why he did not do so.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a sa ka a etsa joalo.
What good has it done?	E kile ea etsa molemo ofe?
I can go back to school.	Nka khutlela sekolong.
This is true for everyone.	Sena ke 'nete ho bohle.
But that is not really the case, perhaps.	Empa ha ho joalo ka 'nete, mohlomong.
In time he will be gone.	Ka mor'a nako o tla be a tsamaea.
This is the way it is.	Ena ke tsela eo ho leng ka eona.
Then soon it will be better.	Joale haufinyane e tla ba betere.
This will make the day more enjoyable.	Sena se tla etsa hore letsatsi le monate le be monate le ho feta.
He has no other reason to be present.	Ha a na lebaka le leng la ho ba teng.
He never asked anyone again.	Ha a ka a hlola a botsa motho.
You do not know what to do with that fact.	Ha u tsebe hore na u etse eng ka 'nete eo.
However, he did not have time to ask.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a se na nako ea ho botsa.
They have said that in the past.	Ba kile ba bua joalo nakong e fetileng.
No, maybe it's better not to.	Che, mohlomong ho molemo hore u se ke ua.
That is what we want now.	Ke seo re se batlang hona joale.
I had no idea what was going on.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe se etsahalang.
I did not want to hear it.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho e utloa.
You must want to do it.	U tlameha ho batla ho e etsa.
I plan to buy this phone.	Ke rera ho reka mohala ona.
He realized his mistake.	O ile a hlokomela phoso ea hae.
They were crying and very happy in the end.	Ba ne ba lla ’me ba thabile haholo qetellong.
We want him to leave.	Re batla hore a tsamaee.
Both she and her husband are constantly tired.	Ka bobeli eena le monna oa hae ba lula ba khathetse.
Of course, this is not an easy task.	Ha e le hantle, ona hase mosebetsi o bonolo.
I did not expect it to work but to work.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore e tla sebetsa empa e ea sebetsa.
Decide to do some of them.	Etsa qeto ea ho etsa tse ling tsa tsona.
I'm going to drive.	Ke il'o khanna.
Often, you would never hear from them again.	Hangata, u ne u ke ke ua hlola u utloa ho tsoa ho bona.
Sometimes it is necessary.	Ka linako tse ling hoa hlokahala.
There were so many things he could save.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a neng a ka li boloka.
Say more.	Bolela ho feta.
But they are learning other things.	Empa ba ntse ba ithuta lintho tse ling.
I ask her why she is doing this.	Kea mo botsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha a etsa sena.
Just start with it.	Qala ka eona feela.
He wants to live.	O batla ho phela.
Maybe we will.	Mohlomong re tla.
Can you hear it?	Na u ka e utloa?
But, that's what it is.	Empa, ke seo e leng sona.
I may never see it again.	Mohlomong nke ke ka hlola ke e bona.
But he had to leave.	Empa o ile a tlameha ho tsamaea.
It's really fun.	Ka sebele ho thabile.
The matter is ongoing.	Taba e ntse e tsoela pele.
About this time, her parents gave her a car.	Nakong eona ena, batsoali ba hae ba ile ba mo fa koloi.
Whatever he asked for.	Eng kapa eng eo a neng a e kopa.
You've seen it before.	O e bone pele.
Enter another room.	Kena ka kamoreng e 'ngoe.
Everyone was talking.	Bohle ba ne ba bua.
How it became a family name I do not know.	Hore na e ile ea e-ba lebitso la lelapa joang ha ke tsebe.
It must speak to.	E tlameha ho bua le.
Do not make this more difficult than it actually is.	U se ke ua etsa hore sena se be thata ho feta kamoo se leng kateng.
No one should be present.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho ba teng.
I wish I could do as well as you.	Ke lakatsa eka nka etsa hantle joaloka uena.
They are here to help.	Ba mona ho tla thusa.
But it could have happened.	Empa ho ka be ho bile teng.
He did not know who he was.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke mang.
He would wait until he knew better.	O ne a tla ema ho fihlela a tseba hantle.
So it seems that both of them are doing the same thing.	Kahoo ho bonahala eka bobeli ba bona ba etsa ntho e tšoanang.
This is what your doctor will need.	Sena ke seo ngaka ea hau e tla se hloka.
I was very happy when my time came.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo ha nako ea ka e fihla.
It would not have worked without that.	E ka be e sa sebetsa ntle le hoo.
I will never see them again now.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke ba bona hona joale.
His wife took everything.	Mosali oa hae o ile a nka tsohle.
We will try that in the future.	Re tla leka seo nakong e tlang.
ask your question.	botsa potso ea hau.
It was not so.	Ho ne ho se jwalo.
It's hard to find it if you go looking for it.	Ho thata ho e fumana haeba u ea ho e batla.
However, he did not care.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa tsotelle.
There are so many things.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata.
However, foreknowledge did not make it easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ho tseba esale pele ha hoa ka ha etsa hore ho be bonolo.
My mother loves her.	'Mè oa mo rata.
Finally someone noticed her.	Qetellong motho e mong o ile a mo hlokomela.
If they can do it, so can we.	Haeba ba ka e etsa, le rōna re ka e etsa.
We do not know why.	Ha re tsebe lebaka.
So this went on.	Kahoo sena se ile sa tsoela pele.
The problem is space.	Bothata ke sebaka.
The man was harder than he could count.	Monna eo o ne a le thata ho feta ho bala.
I want to see you every day.	Ke batla ho o bona letsatsi le letsatsi.
And we are not alone.	Mme ha re mong.
They need our help.	Ba hloka thuso ea rona.
Parents help everyone to be like that.	Batsoali ba thusa hore e mong le e mong a be joalo.
I wonder if we will ever know.	Kea ipotsa hore na ebe re tla ke re tsebe.
It would be wrong to say nothing.	Ho ka ba phoso ho se bue letho.
It will ask a number of questions.	E tla botsa lipotso tse 'maloa.
I still do.	Ke ntse ke etsa joalo.
But the problem persisted.	Empa bothata bo ile ba tsoela pele.
I often used this technique to find it quickly and easily.	Hangata ke ne ke sebelisa mokhoa ona ho e fumana kapele le ha bonolo.
The whole group.	Sehlopha sohle.
I thought you were someone else.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o motho e mong.
Maybe we should go.	Mohlomong re lokela ho tsamaea.
It is an old school but it works.	Ke sekolo sa khale empa sea sebetsa.
It goes live.	E ea phela.
As soon as he can, he will pay.	Hang ha a khona, o tla lefa.
So it was not even a question.	Kahoo e ne e se leha e le potso.
I went back to the beginning.	Ke ile ka khutlela morao ka ho qala.
Without us, you would be nothing.	Ntle le rona, u ka be u se letho.
Not for everyone.	Ha se ea bohle.
But this is not all.	Empa ena hase eona feela.
For a long time, he could not speak.	Ka nako e telele, o ne a sa khone ho bua.
The years seemed to pass quickly.	Lilemo li ne li bonahala li feta kapele.
It's bedtime.	Ke nako ea ho robala.
If they do not, then no.	Haeba ba sa etse joalo, joale che.
The woman stays alone.	Mosali o lula a le mong.
You may ask why.	U ka botsa hore na ke hobane'ng.
No one thought about it.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a nahana ka eona.
I saw you come in.	Ke o bone o kena.
I asked him, and he said he wanted to do it.	Ke ile ka mo botsa, 'me a re o batla ho e etsa.
He felt so much better about things.	O ne a ikutloa a le betere haholo ka lintho.
He was not talking about his past life.	O ne a sa bue ka bophelo ba hae ba nakong e fetileng.
My friends do not talk to me.	Metsoalle ea ka ha e bue le 'na.
He would tell them.	O ne a tla ba bolella.
You have money.	U na le chelete.
He knew her well.	O ne a mo tseba hantle.
However, they could not find anything, these children.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba ke ke ba fumana letho, bana bana.
He continues to do so.	O ntse a tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
That's all and more.	Ke tsohle le ho feta.
Write at night.	Ngola bosiu.
She looked at him quickly.	A mo sheba kapele.
You can't be mine.	O ka se be wa ka.
You really need to try these.	U hlile u hloka ho leka tsena.
Then he returned home.	Eaba o khutlela hae hape.
If you could help it would be better.	Haeba u ne u ka thusa ho ka ba molemo.
No, that was very powerful.	Che, hoo ho ne ho le matla haholo.
I have to live a certain way.	Ke tlameha ho phela ka tsela e itseng.
It would be better not to do so.	Ho ka ba molemo ha o sa ka wa etsa jwalo.
I couldn't do it, man.	Ke ne nke ke ka khona ho e etsa, monna.
There is something.	Ho ntho e itseng.
It's hard, very hard.	Ho thata, haholo.
He wondered how he would feel today.	O ne a ipotsa hore na o tla ikutloa joang kajeno.
They do so, without being present.	Ba etsa joalo, ntle le ho ba teng.
I did both.	Ke ile ka li etsa ka bobeli.
Life is too good to be true.	Bophelo bo monate haholo hore u ka phela feela.
Use this opportunity to make friends.	Sebelisa monyetla ona ho etsa metsoalle.
No one knows him.	Ha ho motho ea mo tsebang.
I try my best.	Ke leka maikutlo a ka.
I just.	Ke feela.
Truth, as it is, is one thing.	'Nete, kamoo e leng kateng, ke ntho e le 'ngoe.
It had been a very long time.	E ne e se e le nako e telele haholo.
They had no children.	Ba ne ba se na bana.
And there is still room for a few other things.	'Me ho sa na le sebaka sa lintho tse ling tse seng kae.
Opinions are not true.	Maikutlo ha se 'nete.
I hope you enjoyed it.	Ke tšepa hore u e thabetse.
It was bedtime.	E ne e le nako ea ho robala.
He had just returned.	O ne a sa tsoa khutla.
I do that.	Ke etsa seo.
Very nice, but actually very nice.	E ntle haholo, empa ha e le hantle e monate haholo.
We did not have the time we needed.	Re ne re se na nako eo re e hlokang.
But he knows it.	Empa oa e tseba.
Some try to have both.	Ba bang ba leka ho ba le eona ka bobeli.
I know him well.	Ke mo tseba hantle.
His problems seem very psychological.	Mathata a hae a bonahala haholo a kelello.
However, this is clearly not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho hlakile hore ha ho joalo.
So first, thank you all for coming.	Kahoo pele, ke leboha bohle ka ho tla.
It was great fun and they enjoyed being with us there.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo mme ba ne ba thabela ho ba le rona moo.
I went to bed early that night.	Ke ile ka robala pele ho nako bosiung boo.
But it has always been so.	Empa ho bile joalo kamehla.
They simply cannot.	Ho hang ha ba khone.
You’re not sure if they go together or not.	Ha u na bonnete ba hore na li tsamaea hammoho kapa che.
That's not what we said.	Ha se seo re se buileng.
It is a real crime.	Ke molato oa sebele.
But there is a problem like this.	Empa ho na le bothata bo kang bona.
I just had to do it.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho e etsa feela.
That is what they are doing from now on.	Ke seo ba se etsang ho tloha joale ho ea pele.
But it does not matter.	Empa ha e bohlokoa.
I didn't go either.	Le ’na ha kea ea.
He would talk about anything, anytime, anywhere.	O ne a tla bua ka taba efe kapa efe, nako efe kapa efe, kae kapa kae.
That should have felt better.	Seo se ne se lokela ho ikutloa hantle.
Now he is gone.	Joale ha a eo.
Trying to think.	Ho leka ho nahana.
You were absent.	U ne u le sieo.
From all your friends.	Ho tsoa ho metsoalle eohle ea hau.
That should go without saying.	Seo se lokela ho tsamaea ntle le ho bua.
He believes that one should help the needy.	O lumela hore motho o lokela ho thusa ba hlokang.
Just in time u.	Feela ka nako u.
I knew my husband was in great pain.	Ke ne ke tseba hore monna oa ka o utloa bohloko haholo.
She looked at him quickly.	A mo sheba kapele.
Now they did not understand much.	Joale ba ne ba se ba sa utloisise haholo.
He certainly should be.	Ka sebele o lokela ho ba joalo.
I really know that.	Ke hlile ke tseba seo.
And it doesn't know.	Mme ha e tsebe.
I want to do this well.	Ke batla ho etsa sena hantle.
He has no money.	Ha a na chelete.
It's really close to watching him.	Ha e le hantle haufi haufi le ho mo shebella.
We want to do what we want.	Re batla ho etsa seo re se batlang.
It's really pretty.	E hlile e ntle haholo.
I did not expect it to be such a place.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore e ka ba sebaka se joalo.
They are trying hard to find him.	Ba leka ka matla ho mo fumana.
Seeing something wrong.	Ho bona ho hong ho phoso.
Say please.	Bolela ka kopo.
That was not the case.	Ho ne ho se joalo.
I did not touch his name, sorry.	Ha kea ka ka tšoara lebitso la hae, masoabi.
For all of them.	Bakeng sa bona kaofela.
He will do that.	O tla etsa seo.
He knew the value of the image.	O ne a tseba bohlokoa ba setšoantšo seo.
You haven't done that yet.	Ha o eso etse seo hona jwale.
Maybe you had a job.	Mohlomong u ne u e-na le mosebetsi.
He looked at the problem for years.	O ile a sheba bothata ka lilemo tse ngata.
I am sure it is.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ho joalo.
You have to stop.	O lokela ho ema.
What happened here today is not wrong.	Se etsahetseng mona kajeno ha se phoso.
No reason, they have to win.	Ha ho lebaka, ba tlameha ho hlola.
You will probably be arrested.	Mohlomong u tla tšoaroa.
This is great.	Ena e ntle.
How long must you travel?	U tlameha ho tsamaea nako e kae.
When he spoke a little, he came out again.	Ha a bua hanyane, a tsoa hape.
You would not do such a thing.	U ne u ke ke ua etsa ntho e joalo.
We think it should be so.	Re nahana hore e lokela ho ba joalo.
If so, take it.	Haeba ho joalo, e nke.
His wife.	Mosali oa hae.
They must be some of our people.	E tlameha ebe ke ba bang ba batho ba rona.
But some refused.	Empa ba bang ba ile ba hana.
Sometimes, if he had done everything right, he would not have seen her.	Ka linako tse ling, haeba a entse ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe hantle, o ne a sa mo bone.
Surely, you must know that.	Ka sebele, u tlameha ho tseba seo.
He may never be there.	E ka 'na eaba ha ho mohla a tla ba teng.
There was absolutely no way for him to do it now.	Ho hang ho ne ho se mokhoa oa hore a e etse joale.
We tried to understand everything.	Re ne re leka ho utloisisa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
That was their most important strength.	Eo e ne e le matla a bona a bohlokoa.
But to do it was a bad thing.	Empa ho e etsa e ne e le ntho e mpe.
These are very difficult to buy.	Tsena li thata haholo ho li reka.
You continue to work on it because it is so important.	U tsoela pele ho e sebetsa hobane e bohlokoa haholo.
And you certainly know that.	'Me ka sebele u tseba seo.
None of them were significant.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona e neng e le ea bohlokoa.
Just call us.	Feela letsetsa rona.
We didn’t know how, and we didn’t want to know.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na joang, ’me re ne re sa batle ho tseba.
They make money on new things only.	Ba etsa chelete ho tse ncha feela.
It's nice to have.	Ho monate ho ba le.
There are not many things you can do.	Ha ho na lintho tse ngata tseo u ka li etsang.
This is a question of homework.	Ena ke potso ea mosebetsi oa sekolo.
It's of a different kind.	Ke ea mofuta o mong.
You are studying together now.	Le ithuta hammoho hona joale.
It's near here.	E haufi le mona.
You talk a lot.	U bua haholo.
This could no longer be true.	Sena se ne se ke ke sa hlola se e-ba 'nete.
Of course, we know it.	Ha e le hantle, rea e tseba.
He was not a child.	E ne e se ngoana.
It was so.	Ho bile jwalo.
It must have.	E tlameha ho ba le.
And that will have to be enough.	Mme hoo ho tla lokela ho lekana.
And they are good to watch.	'Me li ntle ho li shebella.
Thanks for the feedback.	Ke leboha maikutlo.
That's when he rode.	Ke ka mor'a moo a ileng a palama.
You can buy overnight or buy overnight.	U ka reka bosiu kapa ua reka bosiu.
This would not work.	Sena se ne se ke ke sa sebetsa.
It may not be just the weight.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe hase boima feela.
You can hear it here.	U ka e utloa mona.
If you did not do so, do it now.	Haeba u ne u sa etsa joalo, li etse hona joale.
He is very dangerous.	O kotsi haholo.
He refused all questions.	O ile a hana lipotso tsohle.
They said nothing.	Ha ba ka ba bua letho.
You did not have it in you.	U ne u se na eona ka ho uena.
Certainly not.	Ka sebele, ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
The other thing does not have to be true.	Taba e 'ngoe ha se hakaalo hore e be 'nete.
It will not be a problem.	E ke ke ea e-ba bothata.
But my mother did not ask.	Empa ’mè ha aa ka a botsa.
I don't want things from other people.	Ha ke batle lintho ho batho ba bang.
That was a long time ago.	Seo e ne e le khale se le teng.
So, in the second way.	Joalo, ka tsela ea bobeli.
This is not that difficult.	Sena ha se thata hakaalo.
It thinks like a man.	E nahana joalo ka monna.
You are reading this book.	U bala buka ena.
And it seems to belong to him.	Le ho bonahala eka ke ea hae.
We could not.	Re ne re sa khone.
Nothing has ever been enough.	Ha ho letho le kileng la lekana.
And then, before he knew it, hands.	Mme ebe, pele a e tseba, matsoho.
They are moving.	Li ntse li tsamaea.
That was still not enough.	Seo se ne se ntse se sa lekana.
Very nice house.	Ntlo e ntle haholo.
However, we see that this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, rea bona hore sena ha se joalo.
You start working on your situation.	U qala ho sebetsa ka boemo ba hau.
Many loved him.	Ba bangata ba ne ba mo rata.
He began to live with her.	A qala ho lula le eena.
I didn't even know they were there.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe le hore ba teng.
I was beautiful.	Ke ne ke le motle.
He would find her one day.	O ne a tla mo fumana ka letsatsi le leng.
That seems hard.	Seo se bonahala se le thata.
But that will wait until we get back to work.	Empa seo se tla ema ho fihlela re khutla mosebetsing oa rona.
We have a lot of things to do.	Re na le lintho tse ngata tseo re lokelang ho li etsa.
That is what we do and how we think.	Ke seo re se etsang le tsela eo re nahanang ka eona.
Tell your friends !.	Bolella metsoalle ea hau!.
Everyone wants to be close to you.	E mong le e mong o batla ho ba haufi le uena.
He wants to be here.	O batla ho ba mona.
Like his father.	Joalo ka ntate oa hae.
But you are human.	Empa o motho.
They do all they can.	Ba etsa sohle seo ba ka se khonang.
I've seen it before.	Ke e bone pele.
I still hear it to this day.	Ke ntse ke e utloa ho fihlela kajeno.
This is not the case for the second.	Sena ha se joalo ho ea bobeli.
I don't know why.	Ha ke tsebe hobaneng kapa neng.
Is there a reason why you did that?	Na ho na le lebaka le itseng leo ka lona u entseng joalo?
That is very important to us.	Seo ke sa bohlokoa haholo ho rona.
It would mean my job.	E ka be e bolela mosebetsi oa ka.
I need to be there.	Ke hloka ho ba teng.
It came to me then.	E ile ya tla ho nna ka nako eo.
He wasted much time on that occasion.	O ile a sebelisa nako eo haholo.
Speaking was dangerous.	Ho bua ho ne ho le kotsi.
That's just not right.	Hoo ha se hantle feela.
They really knew what to do.	Ba ne ba hlile ba tseba seo ba lokelang ho se etsa.
He eventually received his driver's license.	Qetellong o ile a fumana lengolo la hae la ho khanna.
We really do not know much.	Ruri ha re tsebe hakaalo.
I went to your place but you are not there.	Ke ile sebakeng sa hau empa ha u eo.
It was my job.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa ka.
You have someone else.	O na le motho e mong.
Near me I came back.	Haufi le 'na ke ile ka khutla.
Yes, you are right in it.	E, u hantle ho eona.
Sometimes, it goes to work.	Ka linako tse ling, e ea sebetsa.
I have not yet decided.	Ha ke so etse qeto.
He was the last to leave the room.	E bile oa ho qetela ho tsoa ka phaposing.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
You live very close.	U lula haufi haholo.
There was a girl and a boy.	Ho ne ho e-na le ngoanana le moshanyana.
This is a lot of money.	Tsena ke chelete e ngata haholo.
I love it, and I continue to love it.	Kea e rata, 'me ke tsoela pele ho e rata.
He found strength in it.	O ile a fumana matla ho eona.
They refused our request, so we let them go.	Ba ile ba hana kopo ea rōna, kahoo re ile ra ba tlohela hore ba tsamaee.
During its second season.	Nakong ea nako ea eona ea bobeli.
Of course we did not.	Ha e le hantle ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
He didn't want to talk to me.	O ne a sa batle ho bua le nna.
Otherwise, we have what we have.	Ho seng joalo, re na le seo re nang le sona.
And it has been very difficult.	Mme ho bile thata haholo.
Take the money.	Nka chelete.
However, she heard the question.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a utloa potso eo.
He was not the son he was supposed to be.	E ne e se mora eo ho neng ho hlokahala hore e be eena.
I see you will need help.	Ke bona o tla hloka thuso.
They lie on the ground.	Ba robala fatše.
These were my lifelong friends.	Bana e ne e le metsoalle ea ka ea bophelo bohle.
It was morning.	E ne e le hoseng.
It does everything we need it to do.	E etsa sohle seo re hlokang hore e se etse.
I only work here.	Ke sebetsa mona feela.
Maybe you do not want to be like that.	Mohlomong ha u batle ho ba joalo.
And these are yours.	'Me tsena ke tsa hau.
It was better there.	Ho ne ho le betere moo.
I still have some work to do.	Ke sa na le mosebetsi o mong oo ke lokelang ho o etsa.
But it was difficult to do so.	Empa ho ne ho le thata ho etsa joalo.
However, this is not the case here.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo mona.
But he wasn't, and he knew it.	Empa o ne a se jwalo, mme o ne a e tseba.
I have it.	Ke na le eona.
He always does that.	O etsa joalo ka linako tsohle.
Everyone makes this mistake at some point.	E mong le e mong o etsa phoso ena ka nako e itseng.
Here it is, look.	Ke ena, sheba.
Now was not the time to weep.	Joale e ne e se nako ea ho lla.
His father was the only one who could.	Ntate oa hae e ne e le eena feela ea neng a ka khona.
He is a great man.	Ke monna e moholo.
She had to take care of him.	O ne a lokela ho mo hlokomela.
I would not ask you that.	Ke ne nke ke ka u botsa joalo.
Work with me.	Sebetsa le 'na.
Maybe he was the same age as me.	Mohlomong o ne a lekana le nna.
I had to tell you first.	Ke ne ke lokela ho o bolella pele.
He will meet his friends.	O tla kopana le metsoalle ea hae.
He did not allow anything to pass.	Ha aa ka a lumella letho ho feta.
All in time.	Tsohle ka nako.
It is important to go.	Ho bohlokoa ho tsamaea.
I only heard about it yesterday.	Ke utloile ka eona maobane feela.
He came out alone.	O ile a tsoa a le mong.
Although it meant winning someone close to me.	Leha ho ne ho bolela ho hlola motho ya haufi le nna.
He may feel that way.	A ka 'na a ikutloa joalo.
There was no room for this.	Ho ne ho se sebaka ho ena.
I'm shy and I'm really used to being.	Ke lihlong 'me ke hlile ke tloaetse ho ba.
I was thinking about food.	Ke ne ke nahana ka lijo.
It makes it difficult to finish books.	E etsa hore ho be thata ho qeta libuka.
But do your best.	Empa etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang.
Finally it was time to go home and start dinner.	Qetellong e ne e le nako ea ho ea hae le ho qala lijo tsa mantsiboea.
He was not sure.	O ne a sena bonnete.
It could be much better.	E ka ba betere haholo.
Some could not even stand up.	Ba bang ba ne ba sitoa le ho ema.
I do not know where we are now.	Ha ke tsebe moo re leng teng hona joale.
We had to go back to finish the job.	Re ile ra tlameha ho khutlela morao ho ea qetela mosebetsi.
It would not be difficult to do so.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba thata ho etsa joalo.
You get someone to stay there instead of you.	U fumana motho e mong hore a lule moo ho e-na le uena.
He could never sleep again.	O ne a ke ke a hlola a robala.
Maybe tonight.	Mohlomong hona bosiung boo.
They both need this, he realizes.	Ka bobeli ba hloka sena, oa hlokomela.
So it was hard to know.	Kahoo ho ne ho le thata ho tseba.
I do not say I.	Ha ke re 'na.
They can mean something or nothing at all.	Li ka bolela ho hong kapa ho hang.
I was looking forward to seeing it there.	Ke ne ke lebeletse ho e bona moo.
Then everyone started doing it.	Joale bohle ba qala ho e etsa.
Try to keep her happy.	Leka ho mo boloka a thabile.
This is the last one.	Sena ke sa ho qetela.
They had nothing.	Ba ne ba se na letho.
He opened the book and began to read.	A bula buka mme a qala ho bala.
He just doesn't get it.	Ha a e fumane feela.
You found her husband.	U fumane monna oa hae.
And there are many more like that.	'Me ho na le tse ling tse ngata tse joalo.
Production only works for a limited time.	Tlhahiso e sebetsa ka nako e itseng feela.
Then there were the people.	Joale ho ne ho e-na le batho.
Soon, everyone will do so.	Haufinyane, bohle ba tla etsa joalo.
It was such a close call.	E ne e le mohala o haufi hakaalo.
It always is.	Ho joalo kamehla.
Get yours today.	Fumana ea hau kajeno.
He is not to blame for you or anyone else.	Ha a na molato ho uena kapa ho mang kapa mang.
Then he had nothing.	Joale o ne a se na letho.
People like to finish things.	Batho ba rata ho qeta lintho.
He will do so.	O tla etsa joalo.
The pain is excruciating.	Bohloko bona bo matla haholo.
The actor started playing as a child.	Sebapali se ile sa qala ho bapala ha e sa le ngoana.
You have to give it to him.	U tlameha ho mo fa eona.
But perhaps most should be.	Empa mohlomong ba bangata ba lokela ho ba joalo.
You may need it.	U ka e hloka.
It keeps me thinking.	E etsa hore ke lule ke nahana.
My father knew what was going on.	Ntate o ne a tseba se etsahalang.
I'll be done.	Ke tla be ke qetile.
I think this is going to be a lot of fun.	Ke nahana hore sena se tla ba monate haholo.
Your job is to take care of them.	Mosebetsi oa hao ke ho ba hlokomela.
But in reality it is not.	Empa ha e le hantle ha ho joalo.
They wore the same clothes, and the same hair style.	Ba ne ba apere liaparo tse tšoanang, le mokhoa o tšoanang oa moriri.
Everything was nice and easy too.	Tsohle li ne li le ntle li bile li le bonolo hape.
And it really takes place.	'Me e hlile ea nka sebaka.
There is everything there.	Ho na le tsohle moo.
Thank you.	Kea leboha.
I do not have it better.	Ha ke na eona betere.
It did not seem so strange.	Ho ile ha bonahala e se ntho e makatsang hakaalo.
It still works.	E ntse e sebetsa.
There seemed to be something very strange about him.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho na le ntho e makatsang haholo ka eena.
This book was very difficult, but not difficult.	Buka ena e ne e le thata haholo, empa e se thata.
It had already been so.	Ho ne ho se ho kile ha ba joalo.
Since then no one has ever seen the boy.	Ho tloha ka nako eo ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a bona moshanyana eo.
He was too busy for us.	O ne a phathahane haholo bakeng sa rona.
His feet are in place.	Maoto a hae a sebakeng.
But, you see, it was a strange feeling.	Empa, le a bona, e ne e le maikutlo a makatsang.
This was certainly a difficult decision.	Ruri ena e ne e le qeto e boima.
I will not say.	Ha ke na ho bolela.
Thanks for the delicious food.	Ke leboha lijo tse monate.
I had to think of something else.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
But this is still going on.	Empa sena se ntse se feta.
But just a little bit.	Empa hanyane feela.
It was a good thing to know.	E ne e le ntho e molemo ho tseba.
I just wanted to know how you are doing today.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho tseba hore na u ntse u phela joang kajeno.
For years now.	Ka lilemo joale.
He asked a simple question.	O ile a botsa potso e bonolo.
I heard that.	Ke utloile seo.
This was his chance.	Monyetla oa hae e ne e le ona.
Just by contact.	Ka ho kopana feela.
That is often the case.	Hangata ho ba joalo.
We will never be there again.	Ha re sa tla hlola re e-ba teng.
You probably do not need to.	Mohlomong ha ho hlokahale ho etsa joalo.
She is crying.	O ntse a lla.
Then ask them what it means.	Ebe u ba botsa hore na e bolela eng.
She never thought to ask about it.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a nahana ho botsa ka eona.
Thank you very much.	Ke leboha haholo.
Nothing is more important.	Ha ho letho le bohlokoa ho feta.
This is the way you should do it.	Ena ke tsela eo u lokelang ho e etsa.
No, you did nothing wrong.	Che, ha ua etsa letho le phoso.
It was a good thing.	E ne e le ntho e ntle.
We didn't talk much.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bua haholo.
You always knew you were there for the team.	U ne u tseba kamehla hore o teng bakeng sa sehlopha.
I think we have to think.	Ke nahana hore re tlameha ho nahana.
This is not your idea.	Sena ha se mohopolo oa hau.
There is a place I want to go back to.	Ho na le sebaka seo ke batlang ho khutlela ho sona.
We did what we could.	Re entse seo re neng re ka se khona.
They will already know all these facts and more.	Ba tla be ba se ba ntse ba tseba litaba tsena kaofela le tse ling.
Kick ass.	E monate haholo.
I am not at home.	Ha ke teng hae.
You made him believe he could still do well.	U entse hore a lumele hore o ntse a ka etsa hantle.
If you don't want to, don't do it.	Haeba u sa batle, u se ke ua etsa joalo.
In fact, it was my job.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le mosebetsi oa ka.
It was probably the only way to get in and out.	Mohlomong e ne e le eona feela tsela ea ho kena le ho tsoa.
I cry all the time.	Ke lla ka linako tsohle.
We have decided on these questions.	Re entse qeto ea lipotso tsena.
For many of us, that is often the case.	Ho ba bangata ba rona, hangata ho joalo.
That was a strange thing.	Seo e bile ntho e makatsang.
I think everyone enjoyed it.	Ke nahana hore bohle ba e thabetse.
But they are not.	Empa ha ba joalo.
It was the last time he entered.	E ne e le lekhetlo la ho qetela a kena.
He did not want to go back.	O ne a sa batle ho khutlela morao.
She cries.	Oa lla.
The people were very happy.	Batho ba ne ba thabile.
You move too fast.	U tsamaea kapele haholo.
And I'm still in school.	Mme ke ntse ke kena sekolo.
But they are by no means easy.	Empa ho hang ha li bonolo.
She will wear those.	O tla apara tseo.
That's what I did.	Ke seo ke se entseng.
However, this work was not always routine.	Leha ho le joalo, mosebetsi ona e ne e se oa kamehla.
I hope this will help.	Ke tšepa hore sena se tla thusa.
I did not ask for anything.	Ha kea ka ka kopa letho.
I'm so sorry about that.	Ke masoabi haholo ka seo.
Buy their books.	Reka libuka tsa bona.
Did that mean he could not trust her?	Na ho ne ho bolela hore o ne a ke ke a mo tšepa?
Someone else would get away with that.	Motho e mong o ne a tla tloha ho seo.
I will never forget.	Nke ke ka lebala.
Where the girl was.	Moo ngoanana a neng a le teng.
I can't give my name.	Ha ke khone ho fana ka lebitso la ka.
He was enjoying the best time of his career.	O ne a thabetse nako e ntle ka ho fetisisa ea mosebetsi oa hae.
He had been here before.	O ne a kile a fihla mona.
He had to know everything.	O ne a lokela ho tseba tsohle.
No need.	Ha ho hlokahale.
Here is what happened.	Se etsahetseng ke sena.
Even in the past.	Leha e le nako e fetileng.
We arrive at your house.	Re fihla ha hao.
The problem with this is that his life could be in danger.	Bothata ba sena ke hore bophelo ba hae bo ka ba kotsing.
Her husband should not go out alone.	Monna oa hae ha aa lokela ho tsoa a le mong.
He knows it can be difficult for people.	Oa tseba hore ho ka ba thata ho batho.
They came from the only place he could find them.	Ba ne ba tloha sebakeng se le seng feela seo a neng a tseba ho ba fumana ho sona.
You have something else.	U na le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
But people have to eat.	Empa batho ba tlameha ho ja.
It was easy to work with.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho sebetsa.
You just need time.	O hloka nako feela.
He had to come out a little bit.	O ile a tlameha ho tsoa hanyane.
I still wanted to play.	Ke ne ke ntse ke batla ho bapala.
Surprisingly.	Ka mokhoa o makatsang.
This was my chance.	Ona e ne e le monyetla oa ka.
However, the good news.	Leha ho le joalo, litaba tse molemo.
They let it go.	Ba ile ba e tlohela.
But this morning.	Empa hoseng hona.
That is exactly what we will do.	Ke hantle seo re tla se etsa.
These were missing.	Tsena li ne li le sieo.
I see no fault in it.	Ha ke bone phoso.
He was working.	O ne a sebetsa.
We find nothing here.	Ha re fumane letho mona.
That they will meet again.	Hore ba tla kopana hape.
He thought no one else could do it.	O ne a nahana hore ha ho motho e mong ea ka e etsang.
So that they can be.	E le hore ba ka ba.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke na bonnete.
This seems to be the second time this has happened.	Ho bonahala eka ke lekhetlo la bobeli e etsahala.
He was happy.	O ne a thabile.
There were no significant issues.	Ho ne ho se na mathata a bohlokoa.
I do not know what they are doing, to be honest.	Ha ke tsebe seo ba se etsang, ho bua 'nete.
Probably not this year.	Mohlomong e ke ke ea etsahala selemong sena.
I have to work tonight.	Ke tlameha ho sebetsa bosiung bona.
You do not have to talk about it if you do not want to.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u bue ka eona haeba u sa batle.
It just did his job, of course.	E mpa feela e entse mosebetsi oa hae, ehlile.
I will be his wife.	Ke tla ba mosali oa hae.
It may not have been the police.	E ka 'na eaba e ne e se mapolesa.
Moreover, they did not even know his name.	Ho feta moo, ba ne ba sa tsebe le lebitso la hae.
I know his style.	Ke tseba mokhoa oa hae.
I'll get back to the new ones before too long.	Ke tla khutlela ho tse ncha pele ho nako e telele haholo.
That is why he wants her.	Ke ka hona a mo batlang.
That would be a difficult day.	Leo e ne e tla ba letsatsi le boima.
And that seems like a lot to me.	Mme hoo ho bonahala eka ke ntho e ngata haholo ho nna.
One is that this was not necessary.	E 'ngoe ke hore sena se ne se sa hlokahale.
Drink if necessary.	Noa haeba ho hlokahala.
That's almost all, baby.	Ke hoo e ka bang tsohle, ngoana.
We always knew when he was near.	Kamehla re ne re tseba ha a le haufi.
That is why they needed us.	Ke ka hona ba neng ba re hloka.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	U hloka feela ho hlokomela se etsahalang.
What ?.	Ke eng?.
He has no one.	Ha a na motho.
But he certainly was.	Empa ka sebele e ne e le eena.
More than you want!	Ho feta kamoo o batlang!
However, this was still difficult for him.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se ne se ntse se le thata ho eena.
You just got it.	U sa tsoa e fumana.
But consider what he says.	Empa nahana ka seo a se buang.
In fact, we will often pay a lot of money to do it.	Ha e le hantle, hangata re tla lefa chelete e ngata ho e etsa.
You know very well.	U tseba haholo.
However, it was not easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se bonolo.
Finally, he saw an empty space.	Qetellong, o ile a bona sebaka se se nang letho.
They will get it one way or the other.	Ba tla e fumana ka tsela e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe.
That's a bad thing!	Ke ntho e mpe!
There is another possibility.	Ho na le monyetla o mong hape.
I'm thinking of buying a new car.	Ke nahana ho reka koloi e ncha.
He was looking for a house.	O ne a batla ntlo.
Find out and find out.	Batla sena mme o tsebe.
And it is really very difficult.	'Me ho hlile ho thata haholo.
Maybe he is the man you are looking for.	Mohlomong ke monna eo u mo batlang.
That was not my fault.	Eo e ne e se phoso ea ka.
He could hear it.	O ne a khona ho e utloa.
It's really pretty.	E hlile e ntle haholo.
Or after a few days.	Kapa ka mor'a matsatsi a 'maloa.
So he did.	Kahoo o ile a etsa joalo.
He had his own ideas.	O ne a e-na le maikutlo a hae.
He has no money.	Ha a na chelete.
It will not come soon enough for me.	E ke ke ea tla kapele ho lekana bakeng sa ka.
It wasn’t worth it, but it did.	E ne e sa lokela, empa e entse.
You will hear what happens when everything goes wrong.	U tla utloa se etsahalang ha tsohle li sa tsamaee hantle.
I feel that way.	Ke ikutloa joalo.
You too are good to me.	Le wena o molemo ho nna.
You do not have to do everything.	Ha ua tlameha ho etsa tsohle.
Then he passed by.	Eaba oa feta.
We all knew this time would come.	Kaofela re ne re tseba hore nako ena e tla tla.
I've told it all.	Ke e boleletse bohle.
He really did not know what he wanted.	Ruri o ne a sa tsebe hore na o batla eng.
We've seen something like this before, of course.	Re kile ra bona ntho ea mofuta ona pele, ehlile.
It's just easy to be there.	Ho bonolo feela ho ba teng.
However, this is not a big problem.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se bothata haholo.
He was not just a man now.	E ne e se monna feela jwale.
Because the one who should have been now powerful was not.	Hobane ea neng a lokela hore ebe joale o ne a le matla o ne a se joalo.
They seemed to be doing this without speaking now.	Ba ne ba bonahala ba etsa sena ba sa bue joale.
We did not give them anything.	Ha rea ​​ka ra ba fa letho.
And from now on, this is the first impression.	'Me ho tloha joale ho ea pele, ena ke maikutlo a pele.
He did not eat.	O ne a sa je.
We will get that information when we need it.	Re tla fumana litaba tseo ha re li hloka.
He will be here.	O tla ba teng mona.
There is always that opportunity.	Kamehla ho na le monyetla oo .
Work is not for tomorrow.	Mosebetsi hase oa hosane.
I'll be back soon for news.	Ke tla khutla haufinyane ka litaba.
All my life.	Bophelo bohle ba ka.
Then they fell.	Eaba ba oa.
Yes, of course you would.	E, ho hlakile hore u ne u tla etsa joalo.
As it is.	Joalo ka ha ho le joalo.
I need help to achieve this.	Ke kopa thuso ho fihlela sena.
I go to bed.	Kea robala.
So it should be a fun day.	Kahoo e lokela ho ba letsatsi le monate.
They could use the money in any way they like.	Ba ne ba ka sebelisa chelete ka tsela leha e le efe eo ba e ratang.
It is important in my opinion.	Ke ea bohlokoa ka maikutlo a ka.
Do not use any of mine.	U se ke ua sebelisa leha e le efe ea ka.
He was easy to talk to.	O ne a le bonolo ho bua le eena.
I just don't care.	Ke mpa ke sa tsotelle.
I'm not sure how this should work.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore na sena se lokela ho sebetsa joang.
See! 	Bona!
But there may be others.	Empa ho ka ba le ba bang.
Something is still easier than people '.	Ho hong ho ntse ho le bonolo le ho feta batho'.
But we expected to win.	Empa re ne re lebeletse hore re tla hlola.
Nothing was needed.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale letho.
I would say.	Nka re.
We are here to help you.	Re mona ho u thusa.
Good job.	Mosebetsi o motle.
He said bad things would happen otherwise.	O ile a re lintho tse mpe li ne li tla etsahala ho seng joalo.
Thanks for the feedback in advance.	Re leboha maikutlo esale pele.
Very old family.	Lelapa la khale haholo .
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
They had to learn how.	Ba ne ba lokela ho ithuta kamoo.
They said he would eat anything.	Ba itse o tla ja eng kapa eng.
The food here is also delicious.	Lijo tse mona le tsona li monate.
He says he finished the book on time.	O re o qetile buka eo ka nako.
But that did not happen to him.	Empa seo ha sea ka sa etsahala ho eena.
This is nice, very nice.	Sena se setle, se setle haholo.
He didn't think anyone wanted it.	O ne a sa nahane hore ho na le motho ea e batlang.
Then you have many more.	Joale u bile le tse ling tse ngata.
It was not visible anywhere.	Ho ne ho sa bonahale kae kapa kae.
They got enough work.	Ba ile ba fumana mosebetsi o lekaneng.
I should not have come here.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho tla mona.
It’s work, it’s work.	Ke mosebetsi, ke mosebetsi.
But there is more to risk than just money.	Empa ho na le tse ling tse kotsing ho feta chelete feela.
I hope you will come soon.	Ke tšepa hore u tla tla kapele.
Don't you have other things to do?	Na ha u na lintho tse ling tseo u ka li etsang?
As a thought.	E le mohopolo.
But it is too late.	Empa nako e se e le morao haholo.
It was just too heavy for him.	E ne e mpa e le boima haholo ho eena.
I will do that.	Ke tla etsa seo.
He had neither mother nor father.	O ne a se na mme kapa ntate.
You will probably be fine.	Mohlomong u tla phela hantle.
We did not do it.	Ha rea ​​e etsa.
They don't know their husband.	Ha ba tsebe monna wa bona.
Today, everyone does everything.	Kajeno, bohle ba etsa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
It will come back, maybe, but these things take time.	E tla khutla, mohlomong, empa lintho tsena li nka nako.
He did not deserve it.	O ne a sa lokela.
There were others too.	Ho ne ho e-na le ba bang hape.
It was really fun to watch.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le monate ho shebella.
It's so easy, he thought.	Ho bonolo haholo, a nahana.
I know nothing about myself.	Ha ke tsebe letho ka nna.
That is likely to happen.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe seo se ka etsahala.
But you would have to talk about it another time.	Empa u ne u tla tlameha ho bua ka nako e 'ngoe.
Eventually they will understand it.	Qetellong ba tla e utloisisa.
He may not eat it.	A ka nna a se je.
That is his condition.	Ke boemo ba hae boo.
Another guy.	Mohlankana e mong.
Go ahead, we will say.	Tsoela pele, re tla re.
So why did they do it?	Joale ke hobane’ng ha ba ile ba ho etsa?
It was him too.	E ne e le eena hape.
You can't do things like this.	Ha o khone ho etsa lintho tse kang tsena.
Chances are he will win.	Ho na le monyetla oa hore o tla hlola.
Time was not an opportunity.	Nako e ne e se monyetla.
He decided.	O ile a etsa qeto.
Anything you can do will be fine.	Eng kapa eng eo o ka e etsang e tla ba hantle.
And they often do.	'Me hangata ba etsa joalo.
Then the real work begins !.	Joale mosebetsi oa sebele oa qala!.
However, this is not the best practice.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se mokhoa o motle ka ho fetisisa.
I will be.	Ke tla ba.
Several times since then.	Ka makhetlo a 'maloa ho tloha ka nako eo.
I had to know you couldn’t go through it.	Ke ne ke lokela ho tseba hore o ke ke oa feta ka eona.
Back at school they were very close.	Morao sekolong ba ne ba le haufi haholo.
Yet he looks happy.	Leha ho le joalo o shebahala a thabile.
You may want to like it.	U ka 'na ua batla ho e rata.
More than one.	Ho feta e mong.
You can make a lot of money.	U ka etsa chelete e ngata haholo.
That's a good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle eo.
I continued.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele.
She looked very pretty.	O ne a bonahala a le motle haholo.
Mine is incredibly beautiful.	Ea ka e ntle ka mokhoa o makatsang.
Make sure you tell the truth about it.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u bua 'nete ka eona.
He needed to return home.	O ne a hloka ho khutlela hae.
I was starting to like this place even more.	Ke ne ke qala ho rata sebaka sena le ho feta.
I certainly do not need both.	Ka sebele ha ke li hloke ka bobeli.
I want highs.	Ke batla tse phahameng.
His life was not so simple.	Bophelo ba hae bo ne bo se monate hakaalo.
It works well.	E sebetsa hantle.
They took everything.	Ba nkile tsohle.
It will not cry.	E ke ke ea lla.
However, they are not the only ones.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se bona feela.
He waited until everyone was gone.	O ile a ema ho fihlela bohle ba tsamaea.
It really is a long time.	Ehlile ke nako e telele.
There is nothing worse than not knowing what you will get.	Ha ho ntho e mpe ho feta ho se tsebe seo u tla se fumana.
He was still very happy.	O ne a ntse a thabile haholo.
But it is still not what you want.	Empa e ntse e se seo u se batlang.
We talked every day.	Re ne re bua letsatsi le letsatsi.
Certainly none of us.	Ka sebele ha ho le ea mong oa rōna.
If so, why can't they do it?	Haeba ba bang, ke hobane'ng ha ba sa khone ho e etsa?
And the diary does not present a real problem.	'Me buka ea matsatsi ha ea fana ka bothata ba sebele.
It is not enough.	Ha ea lekana.
But even that is not so bad.	Empa le seo ha se mpe hakaalo.
I still enjoyed doing it.	Ke ne ke ntse ke thabela ho e etsa.
I feel good.	Ke ikutloa monate.
If it happens, it happens.	Haeba e etsahala, e etsahala.
They had one child together.	Ba ne ba e-na le ngoana a le mong hammoho.
You have to help.	U tlameha ho thusa.
I was there, too.	Le nna ke ne ke le teng, ka nako eo.
That's a very good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle haholo.
I don't want to say it.	Ha ke batle ho e bolela.
Maybe that was the idea.	Mohlomong e ne e le mohopolo oo.
That was not the case.	Ho ne ho se joalo.
That should be enough.	Seo se lokela ho lekana.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
It will always be there.	Ho tla dula ho le teng.
Just look at what's happening today.	Sheba feela se etsahalang kajeno.
I do not know when that time will come.	Ha ke tsebe hore na nako eo e tla tla neng.
It was very real.	E ne e le ea sebele haholo.
He decided to eat.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho ja lijo.
I mean something happened to me.	Ke bolela hore ho na le ntho e etsahetseng ho nna.
We were able to do a lot of things.	Re ile ra khona ho etsa lintho tse ngata.
I could hear people standing up.	Ke ne ke utloa batho ba ema ka maoto.
Everyone wants money!	E mong le e mong o batla chelete!
He asked after Mother's life.	O ile a botsa ka mor'a bophelo ba 'Mè.
I did it.	Ke e entse.
I hope you enjoy them as much as my children.	Ke tšepa hore le tla li thabela joaloka bana ba ka.
I did not hear him coming, but there he was.	Ha kea ka ka mo utloa a tla, empa ke eo.
That starts the process of thinking.	Seo se qala mokhoa oa ho nahana.
He wanted to go out and do things.	O ne a batla ho tsoa ho ea etsa lintho.
But they are there.	Empa ba teng.
Instead, say something like, it's a difficult question.	Ho e-na le hoo, bua ntho e kang, ke potso e thata.
Some have done, some are not.	Ba bang ba entse, ba bang ha ba joalo.
He says.	O re.
Allow my time.	Lumella nako ea ka.
We will meet.	Re tla kopana.
That was a mistake.	Eo e ne e le phoso.
It was almost too much, for some reason.	E ne e batla e le ngata haholo, ka lebaka le itseng.
To many, that seems overwhelming.	Ho batho ba bangata seo se bonahala haholo.
To name just a few.	Ho bolela tse seng kae feela.
The police would not like that.	Mapolesa a ke ke a rata seo.
They both love it here.	Ka bobeli ba e rata mona.
He did a great job.	O entse mosebetsi o motle.
The bad in a good way is that.	E mpe ka tsela e ntle ke hore.
That meant knowing where he was.	Seo se ne se bolela ho tseba moo a leng teng.
I don't know what to expect.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o lebeletse eng.
A lot of people were there for me.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba le teng bakeng sa ka.
It should not take too long.	Ha ea lokela ho nka nako e telele haholo.
Maybe we should give them a chance.	Mohlomong re lokela ho ba fa monyetla.
You have to do this.	O lokela ho etsa sena.
I have a lot of them.	Ke na le tsona haholo.
Something is happening here.	Ho na le ntho e etsahalang mona.
I'm so glad to hear that you are working.	Ke thabile haholo ho utloa hore le ntse le sebetsa.
He thinks he is the only one.	O nahana hore o mong feela.
Everyone looked at him.	Bohle ba ile ba mo sheba.
Like a few of them.	Joalo ka tse seng kae tsa tsona.
That will not work.	Seo se ke ke sa sebetsa.
Which, in a sense, he has it.	E leng hore, ka tsela e itseng, o na le eona.
The house looks very nice.	Ntlo e shebahala e le ntle haholo.
What an old place would be without an old group.	Sebaka sa khale se ne se tla ba joang ntle le sehlopha sa khale.
It seems real.	Ho bonahala e le ntho ea sebele.
I love her.	Kea mo rata.
More news is coming soon.	Litaba tse ling li tla tla haufinyane.
I'm sure of that.	Ke na le bonnete ba seo.
Because we really didn't have enough money.	Hobane re ne re hlile re se na chelete e lekaneng.
I had nothing to do with him.	Ke ne ke se na taba ea ho ba le eena.
Nothing worked.	Ha ho letho le ileng la sebetsa.
When will we meet?	Re tla kopana ka nako mang?
He has been with me for a very long time.	O bile le nna nako e telele haholo.
What would he watch? 	O ne a tla shebella eng?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
Do you want something?	A na u batla ho hong?
Look to see how it feels.	Sheba ho bona hore na e ikutloa joang.
We are not talking about this.	Ha re bue ka taba ena.
He says he doesn't, but he does.	O re ha a etse joalo, empa o etsa joalo.
I looked at it.	Ka e sheba.
Isn't that a bad thing? 	Na ha se ntho e mpe?
All he said was to give it time.	Sohle seo a ileng a se bua ke ho e fa nako.
But sometimes things are so simple.	Empa ka linako tse ling lintho li bonolo hakaalo.
Then he stood up and walked away.	Eaba oa ema, oa tsamaea.
Try saying the same thing to a group of your friends.	Leka ho bua joalo ho sehlopha sa metsoalle ea hau.
I continue to do so.	Ke tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
Well with us.	Hantle le rona.
He was still waiting to speak.	O ne a ntse a emetse hore a bue.
I think it should be you.	Ke nahana hore e lokela ho ba uena.
We thought we might not have a house when we returned.	Re ne re nahana hore mohlomong ha re na ntlo ha re khutla.
It was fun.	E ne e le monate.
He says something.	O bua ho hong.
Back too far to the front.	Morao morao haholo ho ea pele.
It seemed easier now.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le bonolo le ho feta joale.
That did not happen.	Seo ha sea ka sa etsahala.
She may be a bit busy.	A ka batla a phathahane.
Surely this team should be able to do that.	Ka sebele sehlopha sena se lokela ho khona ho etsa joalo.
Their time will be one day, somehow coming.	Nako ea bona e tla ba letsatsi le leng, ka mokhoa o itseng o tlang.
He met a woman at a party.	O ile a kopana le mosali moketeng.
You will probably enjoy it.	Mohlomong u tla e thabela.
I wonder where he went.	Kea ipotsa hore na o ile kae.
Dad can be hurt sometimes.	Ntate e ka ba bohloko ka linako tse ling.
That's right! 	Ee, ho joalo!
Take a chance.	Nka monyetla.
No, it could be just a girl.	Che, e ka ba ngoanana feela.
Sometimes it is very painful for them.	Ka linako tse ling ho bohloko haholo ho bona.
There is nothing wrong with my hearing.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka ho utloa ha ka.
They decided that they could do this.	Ba ile ba etsa qeto ea hore ba ka etsa sena.
No, he did not know where he could be.	Che, o ne a sa tsebe moo a ka bang teng.
It may need more.	E ka 'na ea hloka ho feta.
Something like.	Ntho e 'ngoe e kang.
Sometimes they finally get it, sometimes they don't get it.	Ka linako tse ling qetellong baa e fumana, ka linako tse ling ha ba e fumane.
It is coming.	E ea tla.
It will never happen.	Ha ho mohla ho tla etsahala.
I never got it.	Ha ke eso e fumane.
You knew they were there.	U ne u tseba hore ba ne ba le teng.
And u.	'Me u.
And it would not have happened.	Mme e ka be e sa etsahala.
He was right there.	O ne a le teng hantle.
How can life go on in this way!	Bophelo bo ka tsoela pele joang ka tsela ee!
They have never been so long.	Ha ba eso ka ba dula nako e telele hakana.
Except he didn't have it.	Ntle le hore o ne a se na eona.
No one really knew what to do.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba hantle hore na o tla etsa eng.
We are happy together.	Re thabile hammoho.
This is news to me.	Tsena ke litaba ho 'na.
These things can be very difficult.	Lintho tsena li ka ba thata haholo.
I understand this.	Ke utloisisa sena.
If not, you will have only one.	Haeba ho se joalo, u tla ba le e le 'ngoe feela.
I spent hours without them.	Ke ile ka qeta lihora tse ngata ke le ka ntle le bona.
This is an empty space.	Sebaka sena se se nang letho.
We made sure of that.	Re ile ra etsa bonnete ba seo.
That was my second mistake.	Eo e ne e le phoso ea ka ea bobeli.
It was still new.	E ne e ntse e le ncha.
But another.	Empa e 'ngoe.
I could see no reason for it.	Ke ne ke sa bone lebaka.
I should not have gone there.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho ea moo.
I have a long time.	Ke na le nako e telele.
He would sleep here until he fell asleep.	O ne a tla robala mona ho fihlela a robala.
Instead, she nodded.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a lumela ka hlooho.
I'm not that big.	Ha ke moholo hakaalo.
He hopes to return to work soon.	O tšepa hore haufinyane o tla khutlela mosebetsing.
I don't know much about it.	Ha ke tsebe hakaalo ka eona.
I would like one.	Nka batla e 'ngoe.
But he will have to tell you about it.	Empa o tla lokela ho o bolella ka seo.
Your mind is always on them.	Kelello ea hau e lula e nahana ka tsona.
And now she was getting dressed.	Mme jwale o ne a ntse a apara.
I really don't care anymore.	Ruri ha ke sa na taba.
However, it was not too difficult and did not last long.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se thata haholo 'me ha hoa ka ha nka nako e telele.
But it did not work.	Empa ha ea ka ea sebetsa.
Today, though, it would be difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, kajeno ho ne ho tla ba thata.
We will definitely come.	Ruri re tla tla.
If you did not like it, you could pass it on.	Haeba u ne u sa e rate, u ne u ka feta.
The rest was not his business.	Tse ling kaofela e ne e se taba ea hae.
They need you here.	Ba u hloka mona.
Talk to us.	Bua le rona.
And to mention another woman they might meet.	Le ho bolela mosali e mong eo ba ka 'nang ba kopana le eena.
If her husband was sane, she would leave him.	Haeba monna oa hae a ne a e-na le kelello, o ne a tla mo tlohela.
And some you would not know well.	Le ba bang u ne u ke ke ua tseba hantle.
We went into the room together.	Re ile ra kena ka kamoreng hammoho.
We all work well here.	Kaofela re sebetsa hantle mona.
I can do better.	Nka etsa betere.
Moreover, its time had not yet come.	Ho feta moo, nako ea eona e ne e sa tsoa fihla.
I'll get out more.	Ke tla tsoa ho feta.
You do both.	U etsa bobeli.
It makes it move faster.	E etsa hore e tsamaee kapele.
He was not a doctor.	E ne e se ngaka.
Good and.	E ntle le.
They also knew where the fun was.	Le bona ba ne ba tseba moo monate o leng teng.
What are you eating? 	U ja eng?
he wanted to know.	o ne a batla ho tseba.
I did not care how much money was needed.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle hore na ho hlokahala chelete e kae.
I didn't like having nothing to do.	Ke ne ke sa rate ho se be le seo nka se etsang.
I hope you enjoy it more than I do.	Kea tšepa u e thabela ho mpheta.
But we can't think of this.	Empa re ke ke ra nahana ka sena.
She started to get dressed.	A qala ho apara.
I will write tonight.	Ke tla ngola bosiung bona.
I say every one of us has one chance.	Ke re e mong le e mong oa rona o na le monyetla o le mong.
That's what you want to do.	Ke seo u batlang ho se etsa.
I have to admit that this is a very difficult question.	Ke tlameha ho lumela hore ena ke potso e thata haholo.
I know exactly where it is.	Ke tseba hantle moo e leng teng.
I'm new here.	Ke ncha mona.
You can't call them, because they don't have a phone.	U ke ke ua ba letsetsa, hobane ha ba na mohala.
However, it is nice to see you again.	Leha ho le joalo, ho monate ho u bona hape.
So we are still together.	Kahoo re ntse re le hammoho.
He wanted nothing.	O ne a sa batle letho.
He drove his team that way.	O ile a khanna sehlopha sa hae ka tsela eo.
The room was empty.	Kamore e ne e se e se na letho.
Who forgets you about.	Ea u lebala ka.
I can't do it tonight.	Ha ke khone ho e etsa bosiung bona.
He was not so sure.	O ne a se na bonnete hakaalo.
I tried to think back.	Ke ile ka leka ho nahana ka morao.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore ha ho joalo.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
He enjoys reading old books.	O thabela ho bala libuka tsa khale.
But know this.	Empa tseba sena.
But she did not give up.	Empa ha aa ka a tlohela.
I mean, it probably didn't have to happen.	Ke bolela, mohlomong e ne e sa hloke ho etsahala.
It's nice to be here.	Ho monate ho ba mona.
You get nothing.	Ha o fumane letho.
I do not know this.	Ha ke tsebe sena.
I mean, he doesn't.	Ke bolela, ha a etse jwalo.
Everyone was busy, but there would be someone soon.	Motho e mong le e mong o ne a phathahane, empa ho ne ho tla ba le motho haufinyane.
I earn money.	Ke fumana chelete.
It makes him understand many things.	Ho etsa hore a utloisise lintho tse ngata.
You want to watch him.	U batla ho mo shebella.
Yes, that would be the only thing.	E, hoo e ka ba eona ntho feela.
Just log in.	Ho kena feela.
I would love to have it.	Nka thabela ho ba le eona.
This is exactly what he is.	Sena ke sona hantle seo a leng sona.
That's the only way out.	Ke eona feela tsela ea ho tsoa.
I went on with both of them.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele ka tsona ka bobeli.
Or try to.	Kapa leka ho.
This is very dangerous.	Sena se kotsi haholo.
Or they never thought about it.	Kapa ha ba e-s'o nahane ka eona.
He could not read.	O ne a sa khone ho bala.
You can, you know.	U ka khona, ua tseba.
But somehow he had to leave.	Empa ka tsela e itseng o ile a tlameha ho tsamaea.
No one will ever know your name.	Ha ho motho ea tla tseba lebitso la hau.
No work, no food.	Ha ho mosebetsi, ha ho lijo.
Really enjoy it.	Ho e thabela ruri.
That's what everyone was talking about.	Ke seo bohle ba neng ba bua ka sona.
This is all your fault.	Sena sohle ke phoso ea hau.
And in this way he.	Mme ka tsela ena o.
Find it here.	E fumane mona.
Sometimes that happens.	Ka linako tse ling seo sea etsahala.
Her legs fell off.	Maoto a hae a oa.
He shouldn't have done that, either.	O ne a sa lokela ho etsa hoo, le hona.
And dinner was a way to say thank you.	'Me lijo tsa mantsiboea e ne e le mokhoa oa ho leboha.
I wonder how they do that.	Kea ipotsa hore na ba etsa seo joang.
I love you so much, my child.	Ke u rata haholo, ngoana oa ka.
We can all learn something new.	Kaofela re ka ithuta ntho e ncha.
We could see that the children were suffering.	Re ne re bona hore bana ba utloa bohloko.
Yes you are.	Ho joalo u.
Because he hasn't been here so long.	Hobane ha a eso be mona nako e telele hakana.
He was very sorry that he had done that.	O ne a utloile bohloko haholo hore ebe o entse joalo.
He realized that if it was not necessary, it could be dangerous.	O ile a hlokomela hore ha ho hlokahale, e ka ba kotsi.
Where are we going today?	Re ea kae kajeno?
I don't like to talk about it.	Ha ke rate ho bua ka eona.
The question seemed simple enough.	Potso e ne e bonahala e le bonolo ka ho lekaneng.
Like a father.	Joalo ka ntate.
But that is not what happened.	Empa ha se se ileng sa etsahala.
But it is a human issue.	Empa ke taba ea batho.
It has to see how things go.	E tlameha ho bona hore na lintho li tsamaea joang.
He ate too fast.	O ile a ja kapele haholo.
They counted the time until they arrived.	Ba ile ba bala nako ho fihlela ba fihla.
That was a lot of money.	Eo e ne e le chelete e ngata.
Yet they do not think it is an issue.	Leha ho le joalo ha ba nahane hore ke taba.
And he did.	Mme o ile a etsa jwalo.
No, of course not.	Che, ka 'nete, u tlameha.
No police coming.	Ha ho mapolesa a tlang.
These things are fun.	Lintho tsena li monate.
Or maybe.	Kapa mohlomong.
So it is a matter of giving.	Kahoo ke taba ea ho fana.
You don't want that.	Ha o batle seo.
It is necessary.	Ho hlokahala.
Eventually, the truth became clear.	Qetellong, 'nete e ile ea bonahala.
His opinion is second only to others.	Maikutlo a hae ke a bobeli ho feta a mang.
Of course, there was a risk of being arrested.	Ke ’nete hore ho ne ho e-na le kotsi ea ho tšoaroa.
I was sad that he was leaving.	Ke ne ke utloile bohloko hore ebe oa tsamaea.
They were real.	E ne e le ba sebele.
He stopped and looked at her.	A ema a mo sheba.
Spend time with you.	Qeta nako le uena.
He did a great job.	O entse mosebetsi o motle.
I should.	Ke lokela.
There would be no quitting.	Ho ne ho se na ho tlohela.
One place at a time.	Sebaka se le seng ka nako.
Then you can do whatever you want.	Joale u ka etsa eng kapa eng eo u e batlang.
The father allowed the children to sleep at night.	Ntate o ile a lumella bana ho robala bosiu.
That's when he realized it.	Ke hona moo a ileng a e hlokomela.
I do not need anything.	Ha ke hloke letho.
He took everything.	O nkile tsohle.
Space is more than that.	Sebaka sa nako se ngata ho feta moo.
The woman was not from this area.	Mosali e ne e se oa sebaka sena.
However, that decision is not necessary.	Leha ho le joalo, qeto eo ha e hlokahale.
You and your team just need them.	Uena le sehlopha sa hau le lokela ho li batla feela.
He was busy from morning till night.	O ne a phathahane ho tloha hoseng ho fihlela bosiu.
That is what happens.	Ke sona se etsahalang.
There was no such thing as a bicycle ride to work.	Ho ne ho se letho le kang ho palama baesekele ho ea mosebetsing.
We believe that family time is important.	Re lumela hore nako ea lelapa ke ea bohlokoa.
I don't know much about any of that.	Ha ke tsebe hakaalo ka leha e le efe ya tseo.
I asked them to take the risk with me.	Ke ile ka ba kōpa hore ba nke kotsi eo le ’na.
It's bedtime.	Ke nako ea ho robala.
There is a road behind my house.	Ho na le tsela ka mor'a ntlo ea ka.
I came after her.	Ke ile ka tla ka mora hae.
Never do that.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua etsa joalo.
That's not it.	Ha se seo.
No, it was a lot.	Che, e ne e le ngata.
However, I do not know why.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha ho le joalo.
Thank you for that wonderful question.	Kea leboha ka potso eo e ntle haholo.
The children seemed to like it.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka bana ba e rata.
They took everything he had.	Ba nkile tsohle tseo a nang le tsona.
You cannot sit back and wait for things to happen.	U ke ke ua lula fatše 'me ua lebella hore lintho li tla etsahala.
But sadly we still need you.	Empa ka masoabi re ntse re u hloka.
I really don't care.	Ruri ha ke na taba.
But I can say this.	Empa nka bua sena.
There was something about him that was not enough.	Ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ka eena ho neng ho sa lekana.
Of course to buy more.	Ehlile ho reka ho feta.
No, they are not.	Che, ha ba joalo.
You can enjoy this book.	U ka thabela buka ena.
I'm about to finish the book now.	Ke haufi le ho qetela buka hona joale.
We get a lot of that.	Re fumana tse ngata tsa seo.
Nothing came in.	Ha ho letho le ileng la kena.
Well, he refused to do it.	Be, o ne a hana ho e etsa.
And, of course, it is.	'Me, ka sebele, ho joalo.
But we didn't care.	Empa re ne re sa tsotelle.
If you do not want to help your parents, just talk.	Haeba ha u batle ho thusa batsoali ba hao, bua feela.
No one has ever said anything about that.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a bua letho ka seo.
We knew it would never happen again.	Re ne re tseba hore ha ho sa tla ba teng.
It would be fun for everyone except me.	Ho ka ba monate ho bohle ntle le nna.
But this can work, too.	Empa sena se ka sebetsa, hape.
It says he was my husband.	E re e ne e le monna oa ka.
Then comes the time.	Joale ho tla nako.
But we will see them soon.	Empa re tla ba bona haufinyane.
I even drove him back home.	Ke ile ka ba ka mo khanna ho khutlela hae.
Because it's not just a matter.	Hobane ha se taba feela.
It's coffee in the morning.	Ke kofi hoseng.
Who knows where.	Ke mang ea tsebang moo.
From a distance you could see that he was older than his father.	Ha u le haufi u ne u ka bona hore o moholo ho ntate oa hae.
Sometimes learning is hard.	Ka linako tse ling ho ithuta ho thata.
So be careful!	Kahoo hlokomela!
This thing really works.	Ntho ena e hlile ea sebetsa.
If she ever had children.	Haeba a kile a ba le bana.
It was the first time he had come out alone.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele a tsoa a le mong.
It does not seem so.	Ha ho bonahale ho bile joalo.
It was nice to have someone there for me.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba le motho ea teng bakeng sa ka.
We would use them again.	Re ne re tla li sebelisa hape.
But this comes with its own problems.	Empa sena se tla le mathata a sona.
You write your first job.	U ngola mosebetsi oa hau oa pele.
His life was not going well.	Bophelo ba hae bo ne bo sa tsamaea hantle.
Thinking a second time, she decided not to go.	Ha a nahana ka lekhetlo la bobeli, o ile a etsa qeto ea ho se tsamaee.
It was more fun than that.	Ho ne ho le monate ho feta moo.
We will never talk about that again.	Ha re sa tla hlola re bua ka seo.
The truth goes out in the end.	'Nete e ea tsoa qetellong.
If he had a backyard.	Haeba a ne a e-na le ntlo e ka morao.
Apparently they were just here.	Ho bonahala eka ba ne ba le mona feela.
I had to leave early today.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tsamaea kapele kajeno.
This did.	Sena se ile sa etsa.
It can be a great place for a few days.	E ka ba sebaka se setle bakeng sa matsatsi a 'maloa.
I just wanted to talk to you.	Ke ne ke batla ho bua le uena feela.
I don't want to be a mother.	Ha ke batle ho ba mme.
However, we are just getting started.	Leha ho le joalo, re sa tsoa qala.
Breakfast was good for me.	Lijo tsa hoseng li ne li le ntle bakeng sa ka.
Now it is too much.	Joale e se e le ngata haholo.
Some books are old, some are very new.	Libuka tse ling ke tsa khale, tse ling ke tse ncha haholo.
We offer some of our stuff as well.	Re fana ka tse ling tsa lintho tsa rona hape.
I hope you are too.	Ke tšepa hore le uena u joalo.
He was indeed a very handsome man.	Ruri e ne e le monna e motle ka ho fetisisa.
You think about it.	U nahana ka eona.
This is a good opportunity to do so.	Ona ke monyetla o motle oa ho etsa joalo.
I have enough for both.	Ke na le tse lekaneng bakeng sa bobeli.
They both think that the other person has a need.	Ka bobeli ba nahana hore e mong o na le seo a se hlokang.
No one will help you.	Ha ho motho ea tla u thusa.
He obviously loved it.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a e rata.
Money in advance.	Chelete esale pele.
The dog looks tired.	Ntja e bonahala e khathetse.
And they will not find us.	'Me ba ke ke ba re fumana.
As if nothing had happened at all.	Eka ha ho letho le etsahetseng ho hang.
Now think of a second time.	Joale nahana ka nako ea bobeli.
People noticed his absence and suspected something was wrong.	Batho ba ile ba hlokomela ho ba sieo ha hae ’me ba belaela hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
And there was nobody there.	Hape ho ne ho se na motho.
If not, make a mistake.	Haeba ha ho joalo, fana ka phoso.
The power of giving is stronger than anything.	Matla a ho fana a matla ho feta eng kapa eng.
And what else do you want?	Mme ke eng hape eo o e batlang.
He does good to us because he wants to.	O etsa hantle ho rona hobane a batla.
The same is true of others.	Ho joalo le ka ba bang.
This is not what we need.	Sena ha se seo re se hlokang.
But she looks healthy.	Empa o bonahala a phela hantle.
No one even knew that such things could happen.	Ha ho motho ea neng a bile a tseba hore ho ka ba le lintho tse joalo.
Trying to understand the situation.	Ho leka ho utloisisa boemo.
When they are about to eat breakfast.	Ha ba se ba tla ja lijo tsa hoseng.
Looks like you have to have it.	Ho bonahala eka o tlameha ho ba le eona.
He suggested that we meet again next week.	O ile a etsa tlhahiso ea hore re kopane hape bekeng e tlang.
Now, think of it this way.	Jwale, nahana ka tsela ena.
Watching he could do.	Ho shebella o ne a ka etsa.
Many others.	Ba bang ba bangata ba.
Without me, of course.	Ntle le nna, ehlile.
This is where he will start looking.	Mona ke moo a tla qala ho batla.
He should go and he should go now.	O lokela ho tsamaea 'me o lokela ho tsamaea hona joale.
Try to understand the feelings of others.	Leka ho utloisisa maikutlo a batho ba bang.
I'm not sure what it was.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na e ne e le eng.
They are thinking of buying a new car.	Ba nahana ho reka koloi e ncha.
I have no idea.	Ha ke tsebe letho.
This is, if any, good news.	Tsena ke, haeba li teng, litaba tse monate.
After many years, they finally met again.	Ka mor’a lilemo tse ngata, qetellong ba ile ba kopana.
I will go with what he says and what he is doing now.	Ke tla tsamaea le seo a se buang le seo a se etsang ha joale.
Because their friends too may not be able to get out.	Hobane metsoalle ea bona le eona e ka ’na ea sitoa ho tsoa.
Perhaps she felt that way too.	Mohlomong le eena o ne a ikutloa joalo.
I have to say.	Ke tlameha ho bua.
He is good to me, just like everyone else.	O motle ho nna, joalo ka ba bang kaofela.
We must trust them.	Re tlameha ho ba tšepa.
I would never be able to do such a thing, of course.	Ke ne nke ke ka khona ho etsa ntho e joalo, ehlile.
But he was not looking at her.	Empa o ne a sa mo sheba.
It would not have been more difficult.	Ho ne ho ka se be thata le ho feta.
I think it will be very difficult.	Ke nahana hore ho tla ba thata haholo.
He was talking to everyone they passed by.	O ne a bua le motho e mong le e mong eo ba fetileng ho eena.
Walking has a similar problem.	Ho tsamaea ka maoto ho na le bothata bo tšoanang.
They're working on it now.	Ba ntse ba sebetsa ho eona hona joale.
I was just beginning to understand that about him.	Ke ne ke qala ho utloisisa seo ka eena.
That was his first mistake.	Eo e bile phoso ea hae ea pele.
You have to take a chance.	O lokela ho nka monyetla.
I've always been here.	Haesale ke le mona.
It seems simple enough.	E bonahala e le bonolo ka ho lekaneng.
His wife did not like children.	Mosali oa hae o ne a sa rate bana.
He never said that this life would be easy.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a re bophelo bona bo tla ba bonolo.
Don't talk to me about it!	U se ke ua bua le 'na ka eona!
You could buy anything there.	U ne u ka reka eng kapa eng moo.
So it is useless.	Kahoo ha e na thuso.
It could be me.	E ka ba nna.
Everything can happen at that time.	Lintho tsohle li ka etsahala ka nako eo.
I hope you found something useful here.	Ke tšepa hore u fumane ntho e molemo mona.
So you are the only child, then?	Joale u ngoana a le mong, joale?
I hope you enjoy it.	Ke tšepa hore u tla e thabela.
They met once a week.	Ba ne ba kopana hang ka beke.
This is going to be the best, after all.	Ena e tla ba e ntle ka ho fetisisa, ka mor'a tsohle.
So, basically everyone.	Kahoo, ha e le hantle bohle.
And afraid to say anything.	Le ho tšaba ho bua letho.
I couldn't even talk about it.	Ke ne ke sa khone le ho bua ka eona.
That was not just us.	Hoo e ne e se rona feela.
I want you to be here with me.	Ke batla hore o be mona le nna.
He works harder.	O sebetsa ho feta.
I did not see it that way.	Ke ne ke sa e bone ka tsela eo.
I know they are there.	Kea tseba hore ba teng moo.
But it's really fun to hear.	Empa ehlile ho monate ho utloa.
I don't need a job so much.	Ha ke hloke mosebetsi hakaalo.
They were tall.	Ba ne ba le ba telele.
It is easy to understand why.	Ho bonolo ho utloisisa lebaka.
The boy was gone.	Moshanyana o ne a se a le sieo.
I sat down and did nothing.	Ke ile ka lula fatše eaba ke sa etse letho.
The ceremony will take three days.	Mokete o tla nka matsatsi a mararo.
Old friends met again after a lifetime.	Metsoalle ea khale e ile ea kopana hape ka mor'a bophelo bohle.
I must be very late.	E tlameha ebe ke letsa morao haholo.
I will give you your place.	Ke tla u fa sebaka sa hau.
He makes a good doctor's recommendation.	O etsa tlhahiso ea ngaka e molemo.
What kind of dog was he?	E ne e le ntja ea mofuta ofe?
She eats breakfast.	O ja lijo tsa hoseng.
But this gave us a chance to get out.	Empa sena se ile sa re fa monyetla oa ho tsoa.
And I really like to have it.	'Me ke hlile ke rata ho ba le eona.
I'm really trying to do the same thing.	Ke hlile ke leka ho etsa ntho e tšoanang.
I love her so much.	Ke mo rata haholo.
That is not our policy.	Seo ha se molao oa rona.
Well, look at you now.	Hantle, sheba uena joale.
I will just stop to make sure you do.	Ke tla ema feela ho etsa bonnete ba hore oa etsa joalo.
They are very happy.	Ba thabile haholo.
This is what you need to do.	Sena ke seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
You really made me go.	Ka 'nete u entse hore ke tsamaee.
For now.	Bakeng sa hona joale.
The latter did it.	Ba morao ba e entse.
It works just fine.	O sebetsa hantle feela.
Money.	Chelete.
So, of course, you have to do it.	Ka hona, ehlile, o tlameha ho e etsa.
Yes, it was clear yesterday.	E, ho ne ho hlakile maobane.
I will not see it.	nke ke ka e bona.
We made the right decision.	Re ile ra etsa qeto e ntle.
Now she feels better.	Hona joale o ikutloa a le betere.
I was devastated.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko.
I need to.	Ke hloka ho.
I would have a chance to get my books soon.	Ke ne ke tla ba le monyetla oa ho fumana libuka tsa ka kapele.
I refuse to look for anything but you.	Ke hana ho batla ho hong ntle le uena.
I'm glad of that.	Ke thabetse seo.
I needed to be strong for them.	Ke ne ke hloka ho ba matla bakeng sa bona.
We can't do it without your help.	Re ke ke ra e etsa ntle le thuso ea hau.
They wondered how their family was progressing and how their family would fare.	Ba ne ba ipotsa hore na lelapa la bona le ntse le tsoela pele joang le hore na la bona le tla phela joang.
He knew what it was now.	O ne a tseba hore na joale ke eng.
It was almost impossible to get back there.	Ho ne ho batla ho le thata ho khutla moo.
That is not easy to find.	Seo ha se bonolo ho se fumana.
Then there is the problem of children.	Joale ho na le bothata ba bana.
He talks a lot.	O bua haholo.
They watch and take care of every penny.	Ba shebella le ho hlokomela chelete e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
It still has to start fast.	Ho ntse ho le joalo ho qala kapele.
True, it will eventually happen.	Ke 'nete, qetellong e tla etsahala.
My friends are good.	Metsoalle ea ka e molemo.
You know, she's really pretty.	O ya tseba, o motle ruri.
It was difficult to read his thoughts.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bala maikutlo a hae.
Doing the work.	Ho etsa mosebetsi.
It was his child.	E ne e le ngoana oa hae.
Love someone you know.	Rata le motho eo u mo tsebang.
He begins to walk.	O qala ho tsamaea.
I can't find it.	Ha ke e fumane.
Say nothing.	Se bue letho.
Thank you for that.	Ke leboha joalo feela.
It was not their business.	E ne e se taba ya bona.
And it was just beautiful.	Mme e ne e le ntle feela.
This is not the case here.	Sena ha se joalo mona.
Instead, he worked.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a sebetsa.
Maybe he met someone.	Mohlomong o ile a kopana le motho e mong.
Anything else is a quest.	Ntho efe kapa efe e 'ngoe ke ho batla.
Not now, thank you.	E seng hona joale, kea leboha.
That was the beginning of his career.	Ke sona se ileng sa qala mosebetsi oa hae.
There is no time to waste.	Ha ho na nako ea ho etsa lintho tsa bohlokoa.
It was just there.	E ne e le teng feela.
He is an amazing father.	Ke ntate ea makatsang.
But they probably do not.	Empa mohlomong ha ba etse joalo.
Then go ahead.	Joale tsoela pele.
And she did well.	Mme o entse hantle.
He lives alone, though he has a son.	O lula a le mong, le hoja a e-na le mora.
You do not have what you need to continue.	Ha u na seo u se hlokang ho tsoela pele.
It applies to anything.	E sebetsa ho eng kapa eng.
I understand what you want.	Ke utloisisa seo u se batlang.
We need more.	Re hloka tse ling.
Children can understand this.	Bana ba ka utloisisa sena.
It was not an important fact now, but an opinion.	E ne e se 'nete ea bohlokoa hona joale, empa maikutlo.
You are still busy.	O ntse o phathahane.
Then he left.	Eaba oa tsamaea.
I will be more careful in the future.	Ke tla hlokomela haholoanyane nakong e tlang.
I know how much he loved you.	Ke tseba kamoo a neng a le rata kateng.
Meet that morning.	Ho kopana hoseng hoo.
Still, he seemed happy.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a bonahala a thabile.
He often enjoyed talking with her.	Hangata o ne a thabela ho bua le eena.
I need to sleep.	Ke hloka ho robala.
The situation is what it is.	Boemo ke hore na bo joang.
I know you a little bit.	Ke u tseba hanyane.
That's what he loves.	Ke seo a se ratang.
Either way it can work.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe e ka sebetsa.
Try something completely new.	Leka ntho e ncha ho hang.
There was nothing.	Ho ne ho se na letho.
However, we can go somewhere.	Leha ho le joalo, re ka ea sebakeng se seng.
I thought there was something.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho na le ho hong.
Instead, it will come, and it will go.	Ho e-na le hoo, e ea tla, ’me ea tsamaea.
He plays like that.	O bapala joalo.
But the years passed.	Empa lilemo li ile tsa feta.
But it is still there.	Empa ho ntse ho le teng ho fihlela joale.
Today is not the day.	Kajeno ha se letsatsi leo.
That was a few years ago.	E ne e le lilemo tse seng kae tse fetileng.
What will happen to us?	Ho tla etsahala’ng ka rōna?
I need to hear what you think.	Ke hloka ho utloa seo u se nahanang.
You found us right.	U re fumane hantle.
This is definitely a place for future work.	Ka sebele ena ke sebaka sa mosebetsi oa nako e tlang.
He really played well all week.	O hlile a bapala hantle beke kaofela.
I do not understand this.	Ha ke utloisise sena.
However, it can be.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ka ba joalo.
Hopefully it was still working.	Re tšepa hore e ne e ntse e sebetsa.
I don't know if that means anything to us.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hoo ho re bolella letho.
I never thought about leaving your mother.	Ke ne ke e-s'o nahane ka ho tlohela 'mè oa hao.
I need to learn both.	Ke hloka ho ithuta ka bobeli.
However, money is not everything.	Leha ho le joalo, chelete hase ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
They can't have both.	Ba ke ke ba ba le bobeli.
This is very good news.	Tsena ke litaba tse monate haholo.
It always helped.	E ne e thusa kamehla.
We all want to feel special.	Kaofela ha rōna re batla ho ikutloa re le ba bohlokoa.
Long time.	Nako e telele.
It doesn't matter now.	Haho na taba jwale.
All he was.	Sohle seo a neng a le sona.
I did not know him very well.	Ke ne ke sa mo tsebe hakaalo.
Before he died.	Pele a hlokahala.
We will be back soon.	Re tla khutla haufinyane.
If you do not, everyone will be able to tell.	Haeba u sa etse joalo, bohle ba tla khona ho bolela.
This is very important.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa haholo.
There will be something coming to you soon.	Ho tla ba le ho hong ho tla ho uena haufinyane.
It was a lot of stuff.	E ne e le lintho tse ngata haholo.
The matter is very clear to him.	Taba eo e hlakile haholo ho eena.
Maybe in another group.	Mohlomong sehlopheng se seng.
It's not that easy.	Ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
I'm really sorry for what you went through.	Ruri ke masoabi ka seo u ileng ua feta ho sona.
And she was powerless, powerless.	Mme o ne a se na matla, a se na matla.
However, it was here.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le teng mona.
You do not see anyone.	Ha o bone motho.
It will be good for everyone.	Ho tla ba molemo ho bohle.
However, we will say more.	Leha ho le joalo, re tla bua tse ling hape.
It really is not my business.	Ha e le hantle ha se taba ea ka.
I thought he would know it well.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tla e tseba hantle.
Well, maybe he is.	Hantle, mohlomong eena.
But none of that was our case.	Empa ha ho le e 'ngoe ea seo e neng e le taba ea rona.
Probably very good.	Mohlomong e ntle haholo.
Her head cried.	Hlooho ea hae ea lla.
You may be tired of hearing that.	Mohlomong u khathetse ke ho utloa seo.
Age does not matter.	Lilemo ha li na taba.
Someone like us, maybe.	Motho ea kang rona, mohlomong.
They left early in the morning and returned late at night.	Ba ne ba tsamaea esale hoseng ’me ba khutla bosiu haholo.
Their first home, their first child.	Ntlo ea bona ea pele, ngoana oa bona oa pele.
But how can this be beneficial?	Empa see se ka ba molemo joang?
He had to feel his own.	O ne a tlameha ho ikutloa e le oa hae.
Just be there.	Eba moo feela.
That is what we must do.	Ke seo re lokelang ho se etsa.
He took care of everything.	O ne a hlokomela tsohle.
I really enjoy that.	Ke thabela seo haholo.
Not at all.	Ho hang.
A few, maybe more.	Tse seng kae, mohlomong ho feta.
We have to get out of here.	Re tlameha ho tloha mona.
It all takes time.	Kaofela ho nka nako.
And we do not want that to happen.	Hape ha re batle hore ho be joalo.
That was a good idea.	Eo e ne e le tlhahiso e ntle.
How to fix this image.	Mokhoa oa ho lokisa setšoantšo sena.
We had a wonderful time.	Re bile le nako e monate ka ho fetisisa.
News is still the most important issue.	Litaba e ntse e le eona taba ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
He had a book.	O ne a e-na le buka.
They no longer needed it.	Ba ne ba se ba sa e hloke.
I did things you would never have imagined.	Ke entse lintho tseo u neng u ke ke ua li nahana.
He loved her very much.	O ne a mo rata haholo.
They say he still has issues.	Ba re o ntse a na le litaba.
Now think of other things.	Joale nahana ka lintho tse ling.
You can donate anything.	O ka fana ka eng kapa eng.
But it had to be very large.	Empa e ile ea tlameha ho ba ngata haholo.
I don't care who wins.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na ke mang ea tla hlola.
So far it has been so easy.	Ho fihlela joale ho bonolo joalo.
Whatever you do, do not let your wife see any of them.	Eng kapa eng eo u e etsang, u se ke ua lumella mosali oa hao ho bona leha e le efe ea tsona.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ha ho letho leo o ka le etsang ka seo.
Sometimes it is difficult to understand.	Ka linako tse ling ho thata hore motho a utloisise.
It's hard to call.	Ho thata ho letsa.
So they did what they could.	Kahoo ba etsa seo ba ka se khonang.
However, now he was unconcerned.	Leha ho le joalo, joale o ne a se a sa tsotelle.
I'm happy for him, really.	Ke mo thabetse, ruri.
And it's nothing more than that.	Mme ha se letho ho feta moo.
You will have to look forward to it.	U tla tlameha ho e lebella.
He refused to enter.	O ne a hana ho kena.
It was not difficult.	Ho ne ho se thata.
However, we are the children.	Leha ho le joalo, ke rona bana.
It does not matter.	Ha ho na taba.
I was trying.	Ke ne ke leka.
He needs us as we need Him.	O re hloka kamoo re mo hlokang kateng.
But he could trust.	Empa o ne a ka tšepa.
It was early in the morning when the police arrived.	E ne e le hoseng ha mapolesa a fihla.
Then you can stand up.	Ka nako eo o ka ema.
Wherever, we do not know.	Ho kae kapa neng, ha re tsebe.
This old image is very important to me.	Setšoantšo sena sa khale se bohlokoa haholo ho 'na.
But no one noticed.	Empa ha ho motho ea ileng a hlokomela.
Each other.	E mong le e mong.
I know mine was there.	Kea tseba hore ea ka e bile teng.
We will win.	Re tla hlola.
I just lived in it.	Ke ne ke lula ho eona feela.
Some things you just have to do once.	Lintho tse ling tseo u lokelang ho li etsa hang feela.
Of course, this is not the only issue.	Ha e le hantle, ena hase eona feela taba.
You stood back.	U ile ua ema morao.
I entered him.	Ke ile ka mo kena.
Questions?	Lipotso?
I do not know which way.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke tsela efe.
Because it is.	Hobane ho joalo.
We understand them.	Rea ba utloisisa.
We meet in a certain way.	Re kopana ka tsela e itseng.
He did not give them anything they did not have.	Ha aa ka a ba fa letho leo ba neng ba se na lona.
I hope one day he can become an expert at it.	Ke tšepa hore ka letsatsi le leng e ka ’na ea e-ba setsebi ho eona.
You will find it.	O tla o fumana.
But she has never believed it.	Empa ha a e-s'o e lumele.
I work hard for them.	Ke sebetsa ka thata bakeng sa bona.
But, it says you want more.	Empa, e re u batla ho feta.
We could not do it without them.	Re ne re ke ke ra e etsa ntle le bona.
Your image is.	Setšoantšo sa hau ke.
We never looked for him.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra mo batla.
It's hard to take.	Ho thata ho nka.
We can't stay all night here.	Re ke ke ra hlola bosiu bohle mona.
And now he had his place.	Mme jwale o ne a ena le sebaka sa hae.
He tried but could not speak.	O ile a leka empa a sitoa ho bua.
So, it's fun.	Kahoo, ho monate.
But he is not.	Empa ha a joalo.
He does his job.	O etsa mosebetsi oa hae.
I will find you mine.	Ke tla u fumana ea ka.
Think of it.	E nahane.
Her hair long before she had one.	Moriri oa hae khale pele a e-ba le o mong.
He decided to help the dog.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho thusa ntja.
It does not make sense.	Ha e etse kelello.
Maybe I was talking too much about my feelings, too.	Mohlomong ke ne ke bua haholo ka maikutlo a ka, hape.
You must love to spend time with family.	O tlameha ho rata ho qeta nako le lelapa.
And he would tell me.	Mme o ne a tla mpolella.
Good morning, good morning,	Rona hoseng, matsatsi a monate a monate oa hoseng,
He loves you too.	Le uena oa u rata.
I'm almost there.	Ke batla ke le teng.
There was always a future.	Kamehla ho ne ho e-na le nako e tlang.
Of course your house is yours.	Ehlile ntlo ya hao ke ya hao.
Doing everything right, but this thing is still possible.	Ho etsa ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe hantle, empa ntho ena e ntse e ka etsahala.
Or maybe you do not want him to do that.	Kapa mohlomong ha u batle hore a etse joalo.
Then do it again.	Ebe o e etsa hape.
I can use more.	Nka sebelisa ho feta.
He said get out of your clothes.	O ile a re ho tsoa liaparo tsa hao.
Make sure you spend as much money as you can on the outside.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u sebelisa chelete e ngata kamoo u ka khonang ka ntle.
There are a lot of people who want this job.	Ho na le batho ba bangata ba batlang mosebetsi ona.
He continued to study.	O ile a tsoela pele ho ithuta.
I'm still trying to figure out what it could be.	Ke ntse ke leka ho fumana hore na e ka ba eng.
You are still tired.	U ntse u khathetse.
Anything can happen.	Ntho efe kapa efe e ka etsahala.
Amazing.	E makatsang.
The guy has been there for you all your life.	Mohlankana o bile teng bakeng sa hau bophelo bohle ba hau.
Please read the book.	Ka kopo, bala buka.
This issue is very difficult but very important.	Taba ena e thata haholo empa e bohlokoa haholo.
I only have my own.	Ke na le ea ka feela.
Before that, however, it made a very good impression.	Leha ho le joalo, pele ho moo, e ile ea etsa tlhahiso e ntle haholo.
These were not new at all.	Tsena e ne e se tse ncha ho hang.
It works great.	E sebetsa haholo.
Write your search term.	Ngola mohala oa hau oa ho batla.
They say it.	Ba e bolela.
So far he has not.	Ho fihlela joale ha a e-so.
We did not know what we would get.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na re tla fumana eng.
I will do so at my end.	Ke tla etsa joalo qetellong ea ka.
That is how he believed it would always be.	Ke kamoo a neng a lumela hore ho tla ba joalo kamehla.
I think you can work.	Ke nahana hore le ka sebetsa.
It gives us a new way to do it.	E re fa tsela e ncha ea ho e etsa.
So he decides to take the day off and go for a walk.	Ka hona o etsa qeto ea ho tšoara letsatsi le ho tsamaea.
She knew the man.	O ne a tseba monna eo.
But thank you.	Empa kea leboha.
But they can learn it.	Empa ba ka ithuta eona.
Yes, that's just what happened.	E, ke sona se ileng sa etsahala ka sebele.
My father was a great father.	Ntate e ne e le ntate e moholo.
We never wanted children.	Ho ne ho se mohla re kileng ra batla bana.
The baby never came back.	Ngoana ha a ka a hlola a khutla.
He did not know exactly why.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
Instead, they should talk to an adult.	Ho e-na le hoo, ba lokela ho bua le motho e moholo.
They will really enjoy it.	Ba tla e thabela haholo.
I had heard that food is delicious.	Ke ne ke utloile hore lijo li monate.
I try to do the same thing.	Ke leka ho etsa ntho e tšoanang.
Probably never will.	Mohlomong ha ho mohla e tla etsa joalo.
I will not go on seeing them.	Nke ke ka tsoela ho bona.
The dog refuses to eat its food.	Ntja e hana ho ja lijo tsa eona.
There are people who want to help here.	Ho na le batho ba batlang ho thusa mona.
He learned to walk alone.	O ile a ithuta ho tsamaea a le mong.
I found it in her room this morning.	Ke e fumane ka phaposing ya hae hoseng hona.
But the woman says she has to go.	Empa mosali o re e tlameha ho tsamaea.
You took their money.	U nkile chelete ea bona.
That makes him very human.	Seo se mo etsa motho haholo.
I could not play.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho bapala.
We asked him what his name was.	Re ile ra mo botsa hore na lebitso la hae ke mang.
I only earn money.	Ke fumana chelete feela.
Now, look at these.	Jwale, sheba tsena.
Then she had a baby.	Joale o ne a e-na le ngoana.
I have something to do.	Ke na le seo ke lokelang ho se etsa.
I looked at him.	Ka mo sheba.
I want to know that, too.	Ke batla ho tseba taba eo, le 'na.
So he would go.	Kahoo o ne a tla tsamaea.
See if there is anyone before you go there.	Sheba hore na ha ho na motho pele u ea moo.
I wanted to work a little harder.	Ke ne ke batla ho sebetsa hanyane.
We are on our way.	Re ntse re tsamaea.
It's close to nothing.	E haufi le letho.
We did not understand why.	Ha rea ​​ka ra utloisisa lebaka.
It's a long time.	Ke nako e telele.
I just want to hear.	Ke batla ho utloa feela .
No time.	Ha ho nako.
As before, of course.	Joalo ka pele, ka 'nete.
It was fun.	Ho ne ho le monate.
I know better than you.	Ke tseba ho o feta.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho leka hape.
But keep trying.	Empa tsoela pele ho leka.
There is a kind of fun place there.	Ho na le mofuta oa sebaka se monate moo.
I can't read it in a week or more.	Ke sitoa ho e bala ka mor’a beke kapa ho feta.
Then there would be no question.	Joale ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba le potso.
She would cry.	O ne a tla lla.
My life was in danger.	Bophelo ba ka bo ne bo le kotsing.
Then they would get a new one.	Joale ba ne ba tla fumana e ncha.
So it would be busy today.	Kahoo ho ka be ho phathahane kajeno.
Tell him that when he leaves, we will not forget him.	Mo bolelle hore ha a tsamaea, re ke ke ra mo lebala.
Thus, it was not just about money.	Kahoo, e ne e se ka chelete feela.
Maybe who he was.	Mohlomong e ne e le mang.
It is up to you how you do this.	Ho ho uena hore na u etsa sena joang.
The people here live simple lives.	Batho ba mona ba phela bophelo bo bonolo.
However, I am not sure.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke e tsebe hantle.
So are you.	Le uena u joalo.
I'm sure.	Ke na le bonnete.
Here things are going well.	Mona lintho li tsamaea hantle.
People started going to the exit area.	Batho ba ile ba qala ho ea sebakeng sa ho tsoa.
Or one of the other.	Kapa e 'ngoe ea tse ling.
My time off was important.	Nako ea ka ea ho se be teng e ne e le ea bohlokoa.
Things happening now.	Lintho tse etsahalang hona joale.
I walked to school.	Ke ne ke tsamaea ka maoto ho ea sekolong.
That if he did that, it would be so.	Hore ha a ka etsa hoo, ho ne ho tla ba jwalo.
It would help if you cried when that time came.	Ho ne ho tla thusa ha o ka lla ha nako eo e fihla.
To tell the truth to you.	Ho bua 'nete haholo ho uena.
We thought about that.	Re ile ra nahana ka seo.
I did not know that.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe seo.
What happened?	Ho ile ha etsahala'ng?
We were talking about you.	Re ne re bua ka wena.
However, a good child.	Leha ho le joalo, ngoana ea molemo.
You will love it when you use it.	U tla e rata ha u e sebelisa.
We do not think so immediately.	Ha re e nahane joalo hang hang.
You know nothing.	Ha u tsebe letho.
There is not a single car in the whole area.	Ha ho koloi e le 'ngoe sebakeng sohle.
It is better to believe it.	Ho molemo ho e lumela.
And you may.	'Me u ka' na ua etsa joalo.
You do not even know.	Ha o tsebe le ho tseba.
I make breakfast.	Ke etsa lijo tsa hoseng.
Then see what happens.	Ebe o bona se etsahalang.
However, you can still do something.	Leha ho le joalo, u ntse u ka etsa ntho e itseng.
You will probably spend a lot of time planning.	Mohlomong u tla qeta nako e ngata u rera.
If they could ask him how he feels.	Haeba ba ne ba ka mo botsa hore na o ikutloa joang.
I did not understand what it was.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hore na ke eng.
But this is a mistake.	Empa sena ke phoso.
My life comes first.	Bophelo ba ka bo tla pele.
Make it so.	Etsa hore ho be joalo.
He was a teacher at my school.	E ne e le tichere sekolong sa ka.
Think about it a lot.	Nahana ka eona haholo.
He only gives my opinion.	O fana ka maikutlo a ka feela.
And that had just begun.	Mme seo se ne se sa tsoa qala.
He is here to help her.	O mona ho mo thusa.
Then we can ride.	Joale re ka palama.
He needed to know that.	O ne a hloka hore a tsebe seo.
Anyone nearby was also in danger.	Mang kapa mang eo a neng a le haufi le eena le eena o ne a le kotsing.
I decided.	Ke entse qeto.
He is planning what he should do, how to fix things.	O ntse a rera seo a lokelang ho se etsa, mokhoa oa ho lokisa lintho.
I know you know.	Kea tseba hore oa tseba.
Once we meet,	Hang ha re se re kopane,
Of course the mistake was here.	Ehlile phoso e bile mona.
Many others, too.	Ba bang ba bangata, le bona.
Think about your job and your job instead.	Nahana ka mosebetsi oa hau le mosebetsi oa hau ho e-na le hoo.
My children need to eat.	Bana ba ka ba lokela ho ja.
But it was not the only one.	Empa e ne e se eona feela.
Kind of weird kind.	Mofuta oa mofuta o makatsang.
It is a powerful practice.	Ke mokhoa o matla.
So you don't like them.	Kahoo ha u li rate.
That is a strange question.	Eo ke potso e makatsang.
Reading is very important.	Ho bala ho bohlokoa haholo.
We do not know anyone.	Ha ho motho eo re mo tsebang.
It is because there were not many.	Ke hobane ho ne ho se ba bangata.
And well when you were beautiful.	Mme hantle ha o ne o le motle.
But he will win.	Empa o tla e hlola.
It would be strange if that were the case.	E ka ba ntho e makatsang haeba ho ne ho le joalo.
I will try that.	ke tla leka seo.
Both are able to stand up.	Bobeli ba khona ho ema.
And they are not in a better position.	Hape ha ba sebakeng se betere.
Days passed without food.	Matsatsi a ile a feta ke se na lijo.
We did not want to think about that.	Ha rea ​​ka ra batla ho nahana ka seo.
He was no longer interested in anything.	E ne e se e se e sa tsotelle letho.
It is easy to learn.	Ho bonolo ho ithuta.
One book at a time.	Buka e le 'ngoe ka nako.
I read them.	Ke ile ka li bala.
Thank you for that.	Ke leboha seo.
I think that is almost mind-boggling.	Ke nahana hore e batla e le kelello.
Friends were passing through work.	Metsoalle e ne e feta mosebetsing.
They did not go anywhere.	Ha baa ea kae kapa kae.
However, there was plenty of room for me.	Leha ho le joalo, sebaka se ne se le ngata bakeng sa ka.
I went on to him, too.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele ho eena, hape.
I like a lot of things.	Ke rata lintho tse ngata.
It is very clear.	Ho hlakile haholo.
I wanted to be.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba.
Then we left.	Eaba rea ​​tsamaea.
It can do everything.	E ka etsa tsohle.
I did not understand why this thing had to happen.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hore na hobaneng ntho ena e tlameha ho etsahala.
She left before her husband returned.	O ile a tsamaea pele monna oa hae a khutla.
When we are tired, we fall asleep.	Ha re khathetse, rea robala.
He had seen it before.	O ne a kile a e bona pele.
I'll take this one.	Ke tla nka ena.
No one else will talk to you.	Ha ho motho e mong ya tla bua le wena.
Many were weeping.	Ba bangata ba ne ba lla.
Just because I can.	Hobane feela nka khona.
Giving, giving, giving.	Ho fana, ho fana, ho fana.
It really is a strange thing that happens.	Ehlile ke ntho e makatsang e etsahalang.
Talk to them.	Bua le bona.
You need to know.	U hloka ho tseba.
He was the last to arrive.	E ne e le eena oa ho qetela ho fihla.
I would have to take it a little bit.	Ke ne ke tla tlameha ho e nka hanyane.
Going to a party.	Ho ea moketeng.
How would people think of you?	Batho ba tla nahana joang ka uena?
Or something like that.	Kapa ntho e kang eo.
The young man did not like what had happened.	Mohlankana eo ha aa ka a thabela se etsahetseng.
Probably none of them.	Mohlomong ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
If you do not see that, ask.	Ha o sa bone seo, botsa.
But it does not have to be.	Empa ha hoa lokela ho ba joalo.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
My father always said he was looking at it.	Ntate o ne a lula a re o ntse a e sheba.
The place is empty.	Sebaka ha se na letho.
And it will benefit you.	'Me e tla u tsoela molemo.
It wasn't his thing.	E ne e se ntho ya hae.
Which was great.	E neng e le ntle.
Obviously some are heavy.	Ho hlakile hore tse ling li boima.
We must submit our application next week.	Re tlameha ho fana ka kopo ea rona bekeng e tlang.
But I will do it if necessary.	Empa ke tla etsa haeba ho hlokahala.
They need to find friends, and soon.	Ba hloka ho fumana metsoalle, 'me kapele.
I always thought we could live with this.	Ke ne ke lula ke nahana hore re ka phela le sena.
Some do not know what to do.	Ba bang ha ba tsebe seo ba lokelang ho se etsa.
Last week.	Bekeng e fetileng.
Let me think about this again.	E re ke nahane ka taba ena hape.
I want to drive my car.	Ke batla ho khanna koloi ea ka.
I know them by heart.	Ke li tseba ka hlooho.
At that time.	Ka nako eo.
They are aware of the danger.	Ba hlokomela kotsi.
I just finished breakfast.	Ke qeta ho qeta lijo tsa hoseng.
He was the first.	E ne e le eena oa pele.
That way, they went back.	Ka tsela eo, ba ile ba khutlela morao.
It would take years and years.	Ho ne ho tla nka lilemo le lilemo.
There was nobody there.	Ho ne ho se motho moo.
He was waiting for it as he left.	O ne a e emetse ha a tsamaea.
I am out of school.	Ke tsoa sekolong.
I heard that.	Ke utloile joalo.
And that's a strange thing.	Mme ke ntho e makatsang.
It was not necessary.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale.
Look what he did.	Sheba seo a se entseng.
And we hope you will come back.	'Me re tšepa hore u tla khutla.
You really need help with this.	Ruri o hloka thuso ka sena.
Who we can be.	Re ka ba mang.
We all wear clothes.	Kaofela re apara liaparo.
I do not have a girlfriend.	Ha ke na ngoanana.
They may not have said anything.	E ka ’na eaba ha baa ka ba bua letho.
In her first week there are many things to take.	Bekeng ea hae ea pele ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo a lokelang ho li nka.
We have a headache here.	Re na le hlooho mona.
But they do not tell us everything.	Empa ha ba re bolelle tsohle.
He could no longer say, at all.	O ne a ke ke a hlola a bolela, ho hang.
Sometimes we like it, sometimes not.	Ka linako tse ling rea e rata, ka linako tse ling che.
Often, you do not have it.	Hangata, ha u na eona.
He really likes to treat a woman well.	Ha e le hantle o rata ho tšoara mosali hantle.
This was real life.	Bona e ne e le bophelo ba sebele.
But he wanted to.	Mme o ne a batla.
As in the second.	Joalo ka ea bobeli.
You are the strongest.	Ke uena ea matla.
I have a better idea.	Ke na le mohopolo o betere.
Life is what you do to them.	Bophelo ke seo u se etsang ho bona.
We are waiting for a call for a call that may not come.	Re emetse ka mohala bakeng sa mohala o ka 'nang oa se ke oa tla.
But everybody was with them, you know.	Empa e mong le e mong o ne a le mong le bona, le a tseba.
I don’t know why he did this, but it looked so good.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a entse sena, empa e ne e shebahala e le ntle haholo.
I can't stand you.	Ha ke khone ho ema le uena.
We no longer feel lonely in our own kind.	Ha re sa ikutloa re le bang ka mofuta oa rona.
I know how you feel.	Kea tseba hore na u ikutloa joang.
But that will not happen.	Empa hoo ho ke ke ha etsahala.
You have to watch them several times to catch everything.	U tlameha ho ba shebella ka makhetlo a 'maloa ho tšoara ntho e' ngoe le e 'ngoe.
She loved the man.	O ne a rata monna eo.
Probably even before that.	Mohlomong le pele ho moo.
I have never done that.	Ha ke so etse seo.
He could have refused.	A ka be a ile a hana.
I still have feelings for him even today.	Ke ntse ke e-na le maikutlo ho eena le kajeno.
It is not new, but it is not too old.	Ha e ncha, empa le eona ha e-so khale.
It is very dangerous to live together.	Ho kotsi haholo ho lula hammoho.
Or to do something else.	Kapa ho etsa ntho e 'ngoe.
We work hard.	Re sebetsa ka thata.
He was invisible.	O ne a sa bonahale.
Instead, look at what went on.	Ho e-na le hoo, sheba se ileng.
You will have a bad time.	U tla ba le nako e mpe.
There would have been more riding.	Ho ka be ho bile le ho feta ho palama.
They had just met yesterday.	Ba ne ba sa tsoa kopana maobane.
Something happened.	Ho na le ntho e etsahetseng.
Of course, he had his best times.	Ehlile, o ne a e-na le linako tsa hae tse monate.
People are afraid to say yes.	Batho ba tšaba ho re e.
I can't think of any more.	Ha ke khone ho nahana ka tse ling.
It's not really for kids.	Ha e hlile ha se ea bana.
He was really saying that.	O ne a hlile a bua joalo.
I am sure you will love it.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o tla e rata.
I could have seen it before.	Nka be ke ile ka e bona pele.
Police, you like the police.	Mapolesa, o rata mapolesa.
We wanted to have another child.	Re ne re batla ho ba le ngoana e mong.
None of them are significant.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona ea bohlokoa.
I think he is afraid to know more.	Ke nahana hore o tšaba ho tseba haholoanyane.
Everyone wants money.	E mong le e mong o batla chelete.
From your location.	Ho tsoa sebakeng sa hau.
I was able to sleep at the end.	Ke ne ke khona ho robala qetellong.
No, you should not.	Che, ha ua lokela ho etsa joalo.
Talk to you soon.	Bua le wena haufinyane.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha se taba eo.
Everyone will be back.	E mong le e mong o tla khutla.
Get started now.	Qala hona joale.
It was his home and will always be there.	E ne e le hae mme e tla dula e le teng.
You can read about them here.	U ka bala ka tsona mona.
I was happy for him.	Ke ne ke mo thabetse.
The strong take everything.	Ba matla ba nka tsohle.
It doesn't really help me.	Ha e hlile ha e na thuso ho 'na.
He finally gets it.	Qetellong oa e fumana.
They like to travel.	Ba rata ho tsamaea.
This is what he wanted.	Sena ke seo a neng a se batla.
If they were, there would be no point in writing this.	Haeba ba ne ba le teng, ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba le thuso ea ho ngola sena.
I am at school.	Ke sekolong.
Maybe you want to spend time.	Mohlomong o batla ho qeta nako.
Which is also a very good thing.	E leng hore hape ke ntho e ntle haholo.
I wish you would not do that.	Ke lakatsa eka le ka be le sa etse joalo.
Check the return time in advance.	Sheba nako ea ho khutla esale pele.
I just felt that way.	Ke ne ke ikutloa joalo feela.
They will both continue to play a lot.	Ka bobeli ba tla tsoela pele ho bapala haholo.
Soon, that would be the case.	Haufinyane, ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
I did not understand him.	Ke ne ke sa mo utloisise.
You wonder.	Ua ipotsa.
For the first method.	Bakeng sa mokhoa oa pele.
The other one.	E 'ngoe eo.
But the baby was gone.	Empa ngoana o ne a se a le sieo.
Her boyfriend is coming home soon.	Mohlankana oa hae o tla hae haufinyane.
So you like to sing.	Kahoo u rata ho bina.
However, these will continue.	Leha ho le joalo, tsena li ntse li tla tsoela pele.
He didn't come home last night.	O ne a sa tla hae maobane bosiu.
Lots to do.	Tse ngata tseo u ka li etsang.
You need one.	U hloka e 'ngoe.
i found them.	ke li fumane.
It plays strangely.	E bapala ka tsela e makatsang.
I will eat her children.	Ke tla ja bana ba hae.
Whether it is good or bad.	Haeba e ntle kapa e mpe.
He loved it, of course.	O ne a e rata, ehlile.
They had been in pain for a whole week.	Ba ne ba utloile bohloko ka beke kaofela.
You do not even know who you are.	Ha u tsebe le hore na u mang.
Anyone has this condition.	Mang kapa mang o na le boemo bona.
That was what it was.	E ne e le seo e neng e le sona.
Thank you all.	Ke leboha tsohle.
Not sure where to look for these.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na u ka batla tsena hokae.
He read quickly.	A bala kapele.
You think about everything.	U nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
But he will help many others.	Empa o tla thusa ba bang ba bangata.
Do this for a week.	Etsa sena bakeng sa beke.
You do not understand, do you?	Ha u utloisise, na ha ho joalo?
They have no power.	Ha ba na matla.
I felt bad about that.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko ka seo.
What they did not do.	Seo ba sa kang ba se etsa.
Sleeping well for a long time, is what you need.	Ho robala hantle nako e telele, ke seo o se hlokang.
He loved her, he knew that.	O ne a mo rata, o ne a tseba seo.
I've seen them do it.	Ke ba bone ba e etsa.
There is no point in using it here.	Ha ho na molemo oa ho e sebelisa mona.
It just exists.	E teng feela.
I don't know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe ke eng.
Just keep the good stuff, good stuff, or both.	Boloka feela lintho tse molemo, tse ntle, kapa ka bobeli.
I needed to see him.	Ke ne ke hloka ho mo bona.
So we can have a home of our own.	Kahoo re ka ba le ntlo eo e leng ea rōna.
There it is again.	Ke eo hape.
You really want to have something new to say.	Ha e le hantle u batla ho ba le ntho e ncha eo u ka e buang.
We can't find another way.	Ha re fumane tsela e 'ngoe.
That should help you.	Seo se lokela ho o thusa.
However, it is probably better that way.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong ho betere ka tsela eo.
It is as important as it is.	Ke ea bohlokoa kamoo e leng kateng.
We will never know.	Re ke ke ra tseba seo.
My mind was just not speaking.	Kelello ea ka e ne e mpa e le ho se bue.
He loves you very, very much.	O o rata haholo, haholo.
I don’t think he had much.	Ha ke nahane hore o ne a e-na le tse ngata.
Nothing like this had ever happened before.	Ho ne ho se ntho e kang ena e kileng ea etsahala pele.
Since then, he is no longer the same dog.	Ho tloha ka nako eo, ha e sa le ntja e tšoanang.
Until this year.	Ho fihlela selemong sena.
Now is your time.	Joale ke nako ea hau.
My life would never be mine again.	Bophelo ba ka e ne e ke ke ea hlola e e-ba ba ka.
But this is it.	Empa sena ke sona.
He tried again.	O ile a leka hape.
You have a job to do.	U na le mosebetsi oo u lokelang ho o etsa.
Make sure your food is good.	Etsa bonnete ba hore lijo tsa hau li ntle.
Look at everything we went through.	Sheba tsohle tseo re fetileng ho tsona.
That's exactly right.	Ke hantle ruri.
they wonder.	ba ipotsa.
I would be.	Nka ba.
So are you, by the way.	Le uena u joalo, ka tsela.
He did not ask what it was.	Ha a ka a botsa hore na ke efe.
He finished his meal quickly, and left.	O ile a qeta lijo tsa hae kapele, eaba oa tsamaea.
This is an old fact.	Ena ke khale ea 'nete.
I told him so just yesterday.	Ke mo boleletse joalo maobane feela.
They met a man calling.	Ba ile ba kopana le monna e mong a letsa.
You cannot live without this.	U ke ke ua phela ntle le sena.
It seemed pointless.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na thuso.
But somehow it happened.	Empa ka tsela e itseng ho ile ha etsahala.
She was glad she was able to help him.	O ne a thabetse hore ebe o khona ho mo thusa.
However, it really is not my money.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e le hantle ha se chelete ea ka.
This has always been the case today.	Sena esale se etsahala kajeno.
I already do that.	Ke se ke ntse ke etsa joalo.
I don't like it to myself.	Ha ke e rate ho nna.
Opportunity.	Monyetla.
He stopped when he saw us.	A ema ha a re bona.
I no longer think about it.	Ha ke sa nahana ka hona.
It was just a suggestion.	E ne e le tlhahiso feela.
Some people fall.	Batho ba bang ba oa.
It can work again.	E ka sebetsa hape.
It has never lived in it.	Ha ho mohla o kileng oa lula ho eona.
Each time, there was a problem.	Nako le nako, ho ne ho e-ba le bothata.
Thanks again !.	Kea leboha hape!.
They could speak, and he would not have to hear them.	Ba ne ba khona ho bua, ’me o ne a ke ke a tlameha ho ba utloa.
It could have been worse, and it has.	E ka ba mpe le ho feta, 'me ho bile joalo.
He is coming with us.	O tla le rona.
I will tell the truth to you.	Ke tla bua 'nete ho uena.
That is just my opinion.	Eo ke maikutlo a ka feela.
He continued into the room.	O ile a tsoela pele ka kamoreng.
At the time, the phone seemed too big for us.	Ka nako eo, mohala o ne o bonahala o le moholo ho rona.
It seemed as if he would never see her again.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka o ne a ke ke a hlola a mo bona hape.
He talks a lot about writing.	O bua haholo ka ho ngola.
They will meet.	Ba tla kopana.
Then something amazing happened.	Eaba ho etsahala ntho e makatsang.
I will stand.	Ke tla ema.
This did not fix the problem.	Sena ha sea ka sa lokisa bothata.
It is not.	Ha se.
I have to go now.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea hona joale.
I beg from one to the other.	Ke kopa ho tloha ho e 'ngoe ho ea ho e 'ngoe.
So it can't be too much.	Kahoo e ka se be ngata haholo.
Our car is just outside.	Koloi ea rona e ka ntle feela.
Such an amazing place.	Sebaka se makatsang joalo.
He suggests that.	O fana ka maikutlo a seo.
You know what kids' time is like.	Ua tseba hore na nako ea bana e joang.
I wanted to move on.	Ke ne ke batla ho tsoela pele.
Yes, man knows how to win.	Ho joalo, monna o tseba ho hlola.
I'll leave you to it.	Ke tla u tlohela ho eona.
Not at all.	Ho hang ha ho joalo.
He will take care of you.	O tla o hlokomela.
We can win again.	Re ka hlola hape.
We did not know what we were doing.	Re ne re sa tsebe seo re se etsang.
You had to talk to my parents.	U ne u tlameha ho bua le batsoali ba ka.
I don't have that much money.	Ha ke na chelete e ngata hakaalo.
To do that, you must know who he is.	Ho etsa seo, o tlameha ho tseba hore na ke mang.
Maybe more than that.	Mohlomong ho feta moo.
I didn't even have a name.	Ke ne ke sena le lebitso.
It was a strange thing for me.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang ho nna.
Yet it was too late for him.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e se e le morao haholo bakeng sa hae.
It was the first time I had been like that.	Ke ne ke qala ho ba joalo.
But he knew that life was not always easy.	Empa o ne a tseba hore hase kamehla bophelo bo leng monate.
He mentions the food situation.	O bolela ka boemo ba lijo.
No news about your dad.	Ha ho na litaba ka ntate oa hau.
But he was not.	Empa o ne a se joalo.
You can leave it on all night.	U ka e tlohela bosiu kaofela.
Probably all of them.	Mohlomong kaofela ha tsona.
I have never seen this before.	Ha ke bone sena pele.
But if you keep looking for him, he will soon return.	Empa haeba u lula u mo batla, o tla khutla kapele.
He can take it.	A ka e nka.
I had no idea where he might be.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na e ka ’na eaba o hokae.
Maybe you can do better.	Mohlomong u ka etsa betere.
So far, I have it.	Ho fihlela joale, ke na le eona.
He had never had to do that before.	O ne a e-so ka a tlameha ho etsa joalo pele.
Moreover, we will be with you there.	Ho feta moo, re tla ba le uena moo.
The question is not so simple.	Potso ha e bonolo hakaalo.
I would love to have his new book.	Nka thabela ho ba le buka ea hae e ncha.
He called her on his cell phone.	O ile a e letsetsa ka mohala oa hae.
Some of these people do not even know how to speak!	Ba bang ba batho bana ha ba tsebe le ho bua!
I feel strong about it.	Ke ikutloa ke le matla ka eona.
You really don't want to.	Ehlile ha u batle .
But we have to do the work.	Empa re tlameha ho etsa mosebetsi.
We do not know why.	Ha re tsebe lebaka.
I don't like it here, you know.	Ha ke e rate mona, ua tseba.
That was the most important thing.	Seo e ne e le sa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
It was about to turn back.	Ho ne ho se ho se ho khutlela morao.
It was not a question, there was no question.	E ne e se potso, ho ne ho se potso.
They are equally important.	Li bohlokoa ka ho lekana.
Whether you knew it or not.	Hore na u ne u e tseba kapa che.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
You will not find it here!	U ke ke ua e fumana mona!
It is not for me to make that decision.	Hase hore ke etse qeto eo.
If not, forget it.	Haeba ho se joalo, lebala.
Ask someone who can.	Botsa motho ea ka tsebang.
Clearly, he did not know what to do.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a sa tsebe seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
Whatever you like is what you will do.	Eng kapa eng eo u e ratang ke seo u tla se etsa.
We are where we are.	Re moo re leng teng.
We were never enough for him.	Ho ne ho se mohla re kileng ra mo lekana.
I can certainly tell you, no.	Ka sebele nka u bolella, ha ho joalo.
It was important, because people live with these things.	E ne e le ea bohlokoa, hobane batho ba phela le lintho tsena.
None of us will do that.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea tla etsa joalo.
There is no time like the present.	Ha ho nako e tšoanang le ea joale.
He left for work.	O ile a tloha ho ea mosebetsing.
That was his rule.	E ne e bile molao oa hae oo.
I was too much.	Ke ne ke le ngata haholo.
But I do.	Empa ke etsa joalo.
But there was nothing they could do about it.	Empa ho ne ho se letho leo ba ka le etsang ka seo.
Yes it is.	Ee e joalo.
I would like to think that there is a benefit to it.	Ke kopa ho nahana hore ho na le molemo o teng ka eona.
The phone did not ring.	Mohala ha oa ka oa kena.
My head hurts.	Hlooho ya ka e bohloko.
It's family now.	Ke lelapa jwale.
Sometimes it is necessary to try or test your imagination.	Ka linako tse ling hoa hlokahala ho leka kapa ho leka mohopolo oa hau.
The food was incredibly delicious.	Lijo li ne li le monate ka mokhoa o makatsang.
More on children.	Ho feta moo ka bana.
I know, it's easy too.	Kea tseba, ho bonolo hape.
When he came back he was very happy and excited.	Ha a khutla o ne a thabile haholo a bile a thabile.
I will think about what I should do.	Ke tla nahana ka seo ke lokelang ho se etsa.
Please speak.	Ke kopa o bue.
Think about it, it makes no sense.	Nahana ka eona, ha e na kelello.
We did not know who he was.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na ke mang.
He will pass.	O tla feta.
But they will come.	Empa ba tla tla.
People just want to talk.	Batho ba batla ho bua feela.
He was happy today.	O ne a thabile kajeno.
I was not thinking very well at the time.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hantle ka nako eo.
This was always my thing.	Kamehla ena e ne e le ntho ea ka.
Thank you so much !.	Ke leboha haholo!.
They don't seem to care.	Ho bonahala ba sa tsotelle.
I do not have a car.	Ha ke na koloi.
I can’t even imagine how hard it was.	Ha ke khone le ho nahana hore na ho ne ho le boima hakae.
But he did not care.	Empa o ne a sa tsotelle.
I have not done so much in this matter.	Ha kea etsa joalo haholo taba ena.
But she is tired of him.	Empa o khathetse ke eena.
He asked what he could do for them.	O ile a botsa hore na a ka ba etsetsa eng.
The girl is so beautiful.	Ngoanana e motle haholo.
She cried.	O ile a lla.
It must be a driving force.	E tlameha ebe ke mokhoa oa ho khanna.
I really need this place back.	Ehlile ke hloka sebaka sena morao.
My father came out.	Ntate o ile a tsoa.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
I really like it.	Ke e rata haholo.
I could not think of it any other way.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho li nahana ka tsela e 'ngoe.
Many of them.	Tse ngata tsa tsona.
In fact, it is very simple.	Ha e le hantle, e bonolo haholo.
I will do it in due course.	Ke tla e etsa ka nako ya teng.
Do you really want to see this?	Na ehlile u batla ho bona see?
Her father is a doctor.	Ntate oa hae ke ngaka.
We will look at some today.	Re tla sheba tse ling kajeno.
I take the importance of this seriously.	Ke nka taba ea bohlokoa ba sena.
They have a lot.	Ba na le tse ngata.
I wanted to do it.	Ke ne ke batla ho e etsa.
They both talked about it.	Ka bobeli ba ile ba bua ka eona.
It was very clear.	E ne e hlakile haholo.
My mother and I were close.	Nna le mme wa ka re ne re le haufi.
My mother lived here.	'Mè o ne a lula mona.
But it was useless, he thought.	Empa ho ne ho se na thuso, a nahana.
We had water at the time.	Re ne re na le metsi ka nako eo.
It looks like it for hours.	E shebahala joalo ka lihora tse ngata.
Sit back, sit back.	Lula morao, lula morao.
Just do it.	E etse feela.
Anyone can make a suggestion.	E mong le e mong a ka etsa tlhahiso.
She thought so of her son.	O ne a nahana joalo ka mora oa hae.
And others were coming.	Mme ba bang ba ne ba ntse ba tla.
Let me talk a lot about this.	E re ke bue haholo ka taba ena.
He said nothing when he finished.	Ha a ka a bua letho ha a qeta.
They may even be better.	Li ka ba tsa ba betere.
I had that opportunity.	Ke bile le monyetla oo.
Just method, understand.	Mokhoa feela, utloisisa.
They had no children of their own.	Ba ne ba se na bana ba bona.
I mean they were really tired.	Ke bolela hore ba ne ba hlile ba khathetse.
I want you to meet them.	Ke batla hore o kopane le bona.
It was still theirs.	E ne e ntse e le ea bona.
I thought we were enjoying the morning.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re thabela hoseng.
You can say anything.	O ka bua eng kapa eng.
We do not know much about him.	Ha re tsebe hakaalo ka eena.
Nice night, really.	Bosiu bo monate, ka 'nete.
He does not know how he should feel about these matters.	Ha a tsebe hore na o lokela ho ikutloa joang ka litaba tsena.
I understand your point of view.	Ke utloisisa maikutlo a hau.
Swimming is my favorite activity, without reading.	Ho sesa ke mosebetsi oo ke o ratang haholo, ntle le ho bala.
That is very important to me.	Seo se bohlokoa haholo ho nna.
Both of them.	Ka bobeli ba bona.
There was a man behind him.	Ho ne ho ena le motho ka mora hae.
Then the man asked her a question.	Eaba monna eo o mo botsa potso.
In fact, it was quite a bit difficult.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e batla e le thata haholo.
That would be another book.	Eo e ne e tla ba buka e ’ngoe.
I hope that helps !.	Kea tšepa hore seo sea thusa!.
Everything should work now.	Tsohle li lokela ho sebetsa hona joale.
It's been a lot.	E bile ngata.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
It was the first time it had reached him.	E ne e qala ho fihla ho eena.
However, we could work on that.	Leha ho le joalo, re ne re ka sebetsa ho seo.
he says.	o re.
None of them.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona.
I often wish they had been with them.	Hangata ke lakatsa eka ba ka be ba bile le bona.
He was wearing his pajamas.	O ne a apere liaparo tsa hae tsa ho robala.
They worked, and they talked about work.	Ba ne ba sebetsa, mme ba bua ka mosebetsi.
She looks like she's crying.	O shebahala eka oa lla.
I know you understand.	Kea tseba hore ua utloisisa.
And a great opportunity.	Le monyetla o moholo.
They plan to buy a new house next year.	Ba rera ho reka ntlo e ncha selemong se tlang.
You're done.	O qetile.
I felt good walking again.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ho le monate ho tsamaea hape.
The family spent a lot of time outdoors.	Lelapa le ne le qeta nako e ngata le le ka ntle.
It has a start date and a deadline.	E na le letsatsi la ho qala le letsatsi la ho qetela.
Some of my books are the same.	Libuka tse ling tsa ka le tsona li joalo.
Who knows, it might work.	Ke mang ea tsebang, e ka sebetsa.
Food is the best thing.	Lijo ke ntho e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
Meet me here.	Ho kopana le nna mona.
It would not be difficult.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba thata.
We didn't think anything of it at the time.	Re ne re sa nahane letho ka eona ka nako eo.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore ha ho joalo.
It’s weird to say, isn’t it?	Ke ntho e makatsang ho e bua, na ha ho joalo?
It's a big job.	Ke mosebetsi o moholo.
I work on that.	Ke sebetsa ka taba eo.
See you soon!.	Ke tla u bona haufinyane!.
Of course, this is not true.	Ha e le hantle, sena hase ’nete.
We have it down.	Re na le eona fatše.
You can meet strange people.	O ka kopana le batho ba makatsang.
This is very clear.	Sena se hlakile haholo.
The place was clear.	Sebaka seo se ne se hlakile.
This process is not easy to understand.	Mokhoa ona ha o bonolo ho o utloisisa.
Last night, we had dinner with our local friends.	Maobane bosiu, re ile ra ja le metsoalle ea rona ea sebakeng seo.
Don't buy too much.	U se ke ua reka haholo.
It looked very nice.	E ne e shebahala e le ntle haholo.
And it's beautiful, too.	Mme e ntle, hape.
This seems to be the problem.	Ho bonahala eka bothata ke bona.
He wondered how old he was.	A ipotsa hore na o lilemo li kae.
She could not cry.	O ne a sitoa ho lla.
It works very well.	E sebetsa hantle haholo.
He sat back.	O ile a lula morao.
I wanted to be human.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba motho.
And all these things can stand.	'Me lintho tsena tsohle li ka ema.
I hope he will.	Ke tšepa hore o tla etsa joalo.
I could not sit still.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho lula.
He does not eat.	Ha a je.
He will continue to think about it.	O tla tsoela pele ho nahana ka eona.
He never left here the way he is.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a tloha mona kamoo a leng kateng.
Look what we did here.	Sheba seo re se entseng mona.
One in the back.	E 'ngoe ka morao.
He asked if he could stay.	A botsa hore na a ka lula.
No problems here.	Haho mathata mona.
When they heard this, their hands fell off.	Ha ba utloa, matsoho a bona a oa.
We need to move on.	Re hloka ho ea pele.
You heard.	Le utloile.
And it is not.	'Me ha ho joalo.
There is one flaw in it though.	Ho na le phoso e le 'ngoe ho eona leha ho le joalo.
We'll just have to see.	Re tla tlameha ho bona feela.
I start tomorrow night.	Ke qala hosane bosiu.
We stop to look.	Re ema ho sheba.
This one is for people only.	Ena e mona ke ea batho feela.
Do you want to read?	A na u batla ho bala?
His most valuable moment.	Nako ea hae ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
We know what a person looks like.	Rea tseba hore na motho o shebahala joang.
He was present when they left.	O ne a le teng ha ba tloha.
I knew it then.	Ke ne ke e tseba ka nako eo.
We finished well.	Re qetile hantle.
However, he would not have survived if this had continued.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa tl'o phela haeba sena se ne se ka tsoela pele.
Now this is important.	Joale sena se bohlokoa.
He looked older than I was.	O ne a shebahala a le moholo ho nna.
Then the big man came in.	Eaba monna e moholo oa kena.
He's just coming.	O tla feela.
It is very important.	E bohlokoa haholo.
Let's see what we need to know about him.	A re ke re bone hore na re lokela ho tseba eng ka eena.
I'm waiting outside your house.	Ke emetse ka ntle ho ntlo ea hau.
It worked.	E ile ea sebetsa.
My father did not like this subject very much.	Ntate o ne a sa rate taba ena haholo.
I know it's not my business.	Kea tseba hore ha se taba ea ka.
That's a lot of time.	Ke nako e ngata.
Then it is even harder.	Ebe ho thata le ho feta.
I am with my parents.	Ke na le batsoali.
He just needed to be with her.	O ne a hloka feela ho ba le eena.
He asked that morning.	O ne a botsa hoseng hoo.
When he came to my father, he stood up.	Ha a fihla ho Ntate, a ema.
Learning real life.	Ho ithuta bophelo ba sebele.
I like it.	Kea e rata.
There are so many things we can do.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo re ka li etsang.
Fix this, will you?	Lokisa sena, na u tla etsa joalo?
There was no one else.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong.
I did not give it to you for pleasure.	Ha kea u fa bakeng sa monate.
This looked like a house.	Sena se ne se shebahala joaloka ntlo.
Being a good mother or father is often difficult.	Ho ba 'mè kapa ntate ea molemo haholo hangata ho thata.
Time to plan.	Nako ea ho rera.
He stood there, doing nothing.	A ema moo, a sa etse letho.
Many of them.	Tse ngata tsa tsona.
You will read it without thinking.	U tla e bala u sa nahane.
I did not know.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe.
I certainly agree.	Ka sebele kea lumela.
It says exactly what it needs to say.	E bolela hantle seo e hlokang ho se bua.
You have to do what you want.	O lokela ho etsa seo o se batlang.
He would not be able to do it.	O ne a ke ke a khona ho e etsa.
You will want to be there.	O tla batla ho ba teng.
But she thought our lives would be better without children, too.	Empa o ne a nahana hore bophelo ba rona bo ka ba monate ntle le bana, hape.
If this happens and I think it will happen.	Haeba sena se etsahala 'me ke nahana hore se tla etsahala.
That went.	Seo se ile.
Some had heard of it.	Ba bang ba ne ba utloile ka eona.
I have never been.	Ha ke eso be teng.
That is often clear.	Seo hangata se hlakile.
My father did the same.	Ntate le eena o ile a etsa joalo.
Or anything with a name on it.	Kapa eng kapa eng e nang le lebitso ho eona.
I certainly came to my own.	Ka sebele ke ile ka tla ho ea ka.
Somehow there was nothing surprising about it.	Ka tsela e itseng ho ne ho se letho le makatsang ka eona.
Not many.	Ha ngata.
And then you like to get a chance.	Mme ebe o rata ho fumana monyetla.
She looked happy.	O ne a shebahala a thabile.
Make sure you call first.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u letsetsa pele.
The children must go back to school.	Bana ba tlameha ho khutlela sekolong.
He thought about the situation.	O ile a nahana ka boemo.
I'm crying.	Ke ntse ke lla.
I had their time once.	Ke bile le nako ea bona hang.
I asked him what it was and he did not tell me.	Ke ile ka botsa hore na ke eng 'me ha aa ka a mpolella.
I did not start very late.	Ha kea ka ka qala ho fihlela morao haholo.
And you don't say much.	Mme ha o bue hakaalo.
Whatever happens, everyone knows about it.	Eng kapa eng e etsahalang, bohle ba tseba ka eona.
I love that about you.	Ke rata seo ka wena.
He did not want to do anything.	O ne a sa batle ho etsa letho.
He said he did not see what he was doing.	O ile a re ha a bone seo a se etsang.
So, therefore, therefore	Ka hona, ka hona, ka hona
That’s why you had to get it from him.	Ke ka lebaka leo u ileng ua tlameha ho e fumana ho eena.
My wife is a strong woman.	Mosali oa ka ke mosali ea matla.
I wonder how we would have survived without him.	Kea ipotsa hore na re ne re tla khona joang ntle le eena.
If you were here.	Haeba u ne u le teng mona.
You need to let them make friends.	O lokela ho ba lumella ho etsa metsoalle.
There was none.	Ho ne ho se na.
He trusted someone he thought he could trust.	O ne a tšepa motho eo a neng a nahana hore a ka lumela ho eena.
And that's what you've always done.	'Me ke seo esale u se etsa.
It did not help much.	Ha ea ka ea thusa haholo.
And he will not do that.	'Me a ke ke a etsa joalo.
That was not the case.	E ne e se hoo.
They will try to get out of anything if they can.	Ba tla leka ho tsoa ho eng kapa eng haeba ba khona.
He was sure there would be a party.	O ne a na le bonnete ba hore ho tla ba le mokete.
I really don't understand that.	Ha ke hlile ha ke utloisise seo.
We will continue for several years.	Re tla tsoela pele ka lilemo tse 'maloa.
Anything that people were giving to each other at such a time.	Eng kapa eng eo batho ba neng ba fana ka e mong ho e mong ka nako e joalo.
Some of them were caught by others.	Ba bang ba bona ba ne ba tšoeroe ke ba bang.
I kept looking at him.	Ka dula ka mo sheba.
What you say may be true.	Seo u se buang e ka ’na ea e-ba ’nete.
Maybe you were at work.	Mohlomong u ne u le mosebetsing.
I did not know what it was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ke eng.
If not, perhaps it would be best to walk away.	Haeba ho se joalo, mohlomong ho molemo hore u tsamaee.
That was a very good question.	Eo e ne e le potso e ntle haholo.
He is doing that even more.	O ntse a etsa seo le ho feta.
I tried to talk to him.	Ke ile ka leka ho bua le eena.
A lot is happening.	Ho etsahala tse ngata.
Take care of your feet.	Hlokomela maoto a hao.
If we have to.	Haeba re tlameha.
Obviously we haven’t looked hard enough.	Ho hlakile hore ha rea ​​sheba ka thata ho lekana.
It was really easy to learn things here.	Ka sebele ho ne ho le bonolo ho ithuta lintho mona.
Obviously, this is a very serious problem.	Ho hlakile hore bona ke bothata bo boima haholo.
The law is strict.	Molao o thata.
Ancient scholar.	Setsebi sa khale.
It is better to come back.	Ho molemo ho khutla.
Please, please.	Ka kopo, ka kopo.
I wore it and swam.	Ke ne ke e apara ke sesa.
People need to know that they are important.	Batho ba lokela ho tseba hore ba bohlokoa.
We'll have to stay here for a while.	Re tla tlameha ho lula mona hanyane.
I just met your child.	Ke sa tsoa kopana le ngoana oa hau.
This was very nice and everyone was happy.	Sena se ne se le setle haholo mme bohle ba ne ba thabile.
I try hard, but no.	Ke leka hantle, empa che.
Whatever he was saying would stand still.	Eng kapa eng eo a neng a tla e bua e tla ema.
The rest did not say anything after that.	Ba bang kaofela ha ba ka ba bua letho ka mor'a moo.
We will see.	Re tla bona.
Whether you understood or not.	Hore na u ne u utloisisa kapa che.
Where he would have a great opportunity.	Moo a neng a tla ba le monyetla o motle.
He told me everything.	O ile a mpolella tsohle.
I just wanted your suggestion.	Ke ne ke batla feela tlhahiso ea hau.
I have to let him go first.	Ke lokela ho mo tlohela hore a tsamaee pele.
However, that is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
I was out and about.	Ke ne ke tsoa le ka ntle.
What you said was very painful.	Seo u se buileng se ne se le bohloko haholo.
He cannot tell us who he is.	Ha a khone ho re bolella hore na ke mang.
There must be some way to open it.	Ho tlameha ho be le mokhoa o itseng oa ho e bula.
Sometimes without arms or legs.	Ka linako tse ling e se na matsoho kapa maoto.
But it did not have to be this way.	Empa ho ne ho sa lokela ho ba jwalo.
You were always behind me.	U ne u le ka mor'a ka kamehla.
However, according to me.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ea ka 'na.
So, good for them, too !.	Kahoo, molemo bakeng sa bona, hape!.
His father, for another.	Ntate oa hae, bakeng sa e mong.
We like other things too.	Re rata lintho tse ling hape.
Can you look at it quickly.	Na u ka e sheba kapele.
I refuse to eat those foods.	Ke hana ho ja lijo tseo.
We had wonderful times.	Re bile le linako tse monate.
It worked well.	E ne e sebetsa hantle.
His strength was evident.	Matla a hae a ne a hlakile.
We could not walk.	Ha rea ​​ka ra khona ho tsamaea.
And a day after that again.	Le letsatsi ka mor'a moo hape.
Instead, we buy new ones.	Ho e-na le hoo, re reka tse ncha.
But he had to be present.	Empa o ne a lokela ho ba teng.
He had heard enough.	O ne a utloile ho lekana.
Her father is still living there.	Ntate oa hae o ntse a lula moo.
That is not the case.	Ha se taba eo.
But that's the way he is.	Empa ke kamoo a leng kateng.
I do this.	Ke etsa sena.
And it was good to think.	'Me ho ne ho le molemo ho nahana.
We can do it, and we will do it.	Re ka e etsa, 'me re tla e etsa.
It is better to continue.	Ho molemo ha o tsoela pele.
Nobody knew anything.	Ho ne ho se motho ya tsebang letho.
We didn't just talk about certain things.	Re ne re sa bue ka lintho tse itseng feela.
Never tell him he is too good for you.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua mo bolella hore o molemo haholo bakeng sa hau.
He plays a player.	O bapala sebapali.
It's his time.	Ke nako ea hae.
Such a strange feeling.	Maikutlo a makatsang joalo.
Everything is as it should be.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e kamoo e lokelang ho ba kateng.
You have the opportunity to do what is right.	U na le monyetla oa ho etsa se molemo.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
Nothing is close enough.	Ha ho letho le haufi ka ho lekana.
There were many more.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse ling tse ngata.
Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk.	Bua le ngaka ea hau haeba u nahana hore u ka ba kotsing.
But he never was.	Empa o ne a eso be teng.
Someone had to say it.	E mong o ne a lokela ho e bua.
Otherwise, they could not stay as long as they wanted.	Ntle ho moo, ba ne ba ke ke ba lula ha ba batla.
She seemed to be a tough woman.	O ne a bonahala eka ke mosali ea thata.
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le joalo.
I love this house.	Ke rata ntlo ena.
What is this.	Ke eng e.
But he did not know that.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe seo.
I know him, he can't do anything without it.	Kea mo tseba, a ke ke a etsa letho ntle le eona.
Then again.	Ebe hape.
Time period.	Nako ea nako.
That's the life that did it.	Ke bophelo bo entseng hoo.
I am not, but I am not a man either.	Ha ke joalo, empa le 'na ha ke monna.
Anyway, I'd like to take another day.	Leha ho le joalo, ke tla rata ho nka letsatsi le leng.
Maybe it still exists.	Mohlomong e ntse e le teng.
I would have enjoyed it.	Nka be ke ile ka e thabela.
He came back for a second.	O ile a khutla bakeng sa ea bobeli.
It can be a very important thing to do.	E ka ba ntho ea bohlokoa haholo ho e etsa.
This is more than helpful.	Sena se feta ho thusa.
I came after her.	Ke ile ka tla ka mora hae.
That's what the boy is doing here.	Ke seo moshanyana a se etsang mona.
We used to talk and talk and talk.	Re ne re kile ra bua le ho bua le ho bua.
What you probably know.	Tseo mohlomong u li tsebang.
But there is more to it than that.	Empa e ngata ho feta moo.
That's right, but you got it.	Ho joalo, empa o e fumane.
That's right, you know.	Ke 'nete, ua tseba.
I enjoyed that work.	Ke ile ka thabela mosebetsi oo.
I just know he's not there.	Ke tseba feela hore ha a eo.
It was a wonderful day for everyone.	E ne e le letsatsi le monate ho bohle.
I need to go see him.	Ke hloka ho ea mo bona.
Why would you do that?	Hobaneng u ka etsa joalo?
The reality of the daily diet.	'Nete ea lijo tsa letsatsi.
I just don't understand it.	Ke mpa ke sa e utloisise.
How to make your own.	Mokhoa oa ho etsa ea hau.
None of them said anything.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ileng a bua letho.
Because I have no money.	Hobane ha ke na chelete.
What’s so amazing about that ???.	Ke eng e makatsang ka seo???.
There is no more day.	Ha ho sa le letsatsi.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
Out of work.	Ho tsoa mosebetsing.
You have to think.	O na le hore o nahane.
I have no book and they start talking.	Ha ke na buka mme ba qala ho bua.
We did not know what to do.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na re etse eng.
Long, very long.	Nako e telele, e telele haholo.
They could hear someone coming.	Ba ne ba utloa motho ea tlang.
He worked really well, too.	O ne a sebetsa hantle haholo, hape.
I'm not sure where to start to fix this.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka qala kae ho lokisa taba ena.
This did not help.	Sena ha sea ka sa thusa.
Tell your father.	Bolella ntate oa hao.
It should be beautiful.	E lokela ho ba ntle.
I should know that at this point without asking.	Ke lokela ho tseba hore ka nako ena ntle le ho botsa.
Everyone gets it.	E mong le e mong oa e fumana.
It takes time to get to know your child.	Ho nka nako hore u tsebe ngoana oa hao.
We started spending time together.	Re ile ra qala ho qeta nako re le hammoho.
It doesn't seem like much of what people like me can do here.	Ha ho bonahale ho le ngata hoo batho ba ratang 'na ba ka o etsang mona.
So let them be.	Kahoo ba ke ba be joalo.
But it was really giving and taking a lot.	Empa e ne e hlile e le ho fana le ho nka haholo.
I thought it was very good.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e ntle haholo.
This is how we speak well.	Ena ke tsela eo re buang hantle ka eona.
I have nothing to speak about.	Ha ke na letho leo nka buang le lona ka lona.
I got it, but really.	Ke e fumane, empa ha e le hantle.
Your point is.	Taba ea hau ke.
It doesn't seem to be the case anymore.	Ho bonahala eka ha ho sa le joalo.
He long ago realized that his work was useless.	O ile a hlokomela khale hore mosebetsi oa hae ha o na thuso.
He knows we value him.	Oa tseba hore re mo nka e le oa bohlokoa.
So far, so good.	Ho fihlela joale, ho joalo.
I am here because it is not appropriate.	Ke mona hobane ha hoa lokela.
Wear only your shoes.	Apara lieta tsa hao feela.
You may suffer the most.	U ka 'na ua utloa bohloko ka ho fetisisa.
As it was.	Joalo ka ha ho ne ho le joalo.
But soon.	Empa haufinyane.
In his pain.	Ka bohloko ba hae.
But no one else.	Empa ha ho motho e mong.
He told us everything.	O re boleletse tsohle.
But no one knows this.	Empa ha ho motho ea tsebang sena.
Try to get here in advance.	Leka ho fihla mona esale pele.
I started first.	Ke ile ka qala ka pele.
However, somehow it did not seem as heavy as before.	Leha ho le joalo, ka tsela e itseng e ne e sa bonahale e le boima joaloka pele.
How could a girl refuse ?.	Ngoanana o ne a ka hana joang?.
None of your business.	Ha se taba ea hau.
I work well.	Ke sebetsa hantle.
No one had to say it.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tlameha ho e bua.
So this is a very difficult time.	Kahoo ena ke nako e thata haholo.
In fact, he came to us for help.	Ha e le hantle o ile a tla ho rōna ho kōpa thuso.
Everyone had something to say about it.	E mong le e mong o ne a na le seo a ka se buang ka hona.
I want to make this more visible.	Ke batla ho etsa hore sena se bonahale haholoanyane.
I want them.	kea li batla.
And, they did.	Mme, ba ile ba etsa jwalo.
None of them looked good.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a shebahala hantle.
He begins to stand up.	O qala ho ema ka maoto.
He asked only questions.	O ile a botsa lipotso feela.
This was to get to where he was going.	Mona e ne e le ho fihlela moo a neng a tla ea teng.
That did not happen to me.	Seo ha sea ka sa etsahala ho 'na.
It would not be so bad.	E ne e ka se be mpe hakaalo.
We do that here.	Re etsa joalo mona.
I like to start with the individual.	Ke rata ho qala ka motho ka mong.
I can no longer talk about the fear of giving too much.	Ha ke sa khona ho bua ka ho tšaba ho fana haholo.
We did not stay in one place for long.	Ha rea ​​ka ra lula sebakeng se le seng nako e telele.
But we wanted to be parents.	Empa re ne re batla ho ba batsoali.
If they have to, or just because they like it.	Haeba ba tlameha, kapa hobane feela ba e rata.
He seemed very happy with his life.	O ne a bonahala a thabile haholo ka bophelo ba hae.
I will read this as soon as I get home.	Ke tla bala sena hang ha ke fihla hae.
But, but, but.	Empa, empa, empa.
I had nothing.	Ke ne ke sena letho.
And that is exactly what happened.	Mme ke sona se ileng sa etsahala hantle.
I mean he was calling again.	Ke bolela hore o ne a ntse a letsa hape.
We are truly grateful.	Ka sebele re leboha haholo.
Without you, of course.	Ntle le uena, ehlile.
And why they did not.	'Me ke hobane'ng ha ba ne ba sa.
Then they went to his room.	Eaba ba ea kamoreng ea hae.
I did nothing about it.	Ke ne ke sa etsa letho ka eona.
We could live with it.	Re ne re ka phela le eona.
He will win in the end.	O tla hlola qetellong.
He is still there.	O ntse a le teng.
We are the only ones here and nothing has happened.	Ke rona feela mona mme ha ho letho le etsahetseng.
I wanted to work with you.	Ke ne ke batla ho sebetsa le uena.
From home.	Ho tloha hae hae.
No one else knows it exists.	Ha ho motho e mong ea tsebang hore e teng.
There was no one at home.	Ho ne ho se motho hae.
She sat back again.	A dula morao hape.
He needed strength.	O ne a hloka matla.
He can stay.	A ka dula.
So he decided to move on.	Kahoo o ile a etsa qeto ea ho tsoela pele ka hloko.
He entered the room.	A kena ka phaposing.
I don't have water either.	Ha ke na metsi le nna.
Many people believe this.	Batho ba bangata ba lumela sena.
How old? 	Lilemo tse kae?
But last night he left us.	Empa bosiung ba maobane o ile a tloha ho rona.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
He was doing nothing.	O ne a sa etse letho.
Both at the same time.	Ka bobeli ka nako e le 'ngoe.
I wish he could say something, like what he knows.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka bua ho hong, joalo ka seo a se tsebang.
He just does, like so many others.	O mpa a etsa joalo, joalo ka ba bang ba bangata.
Also, he was not thinking well.	Hape, o ne a sa nahane hantle.
Or a boy.	Kapa moshanyana.
Have a great day !.	E-ba le letsatsi le monate!.
Now be well.	Jwale eba hantle.
Of course now, his.	Ehlile jwale, ya hae.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho ne ho le joalo.
I want the team to know what happened, that we left.	Ke batla hore sehlopha se tsebe se etsahetseng, hore ebe re ile ra tloha.
Nobody wants anything.	Ha ho motho ea batlang letho.
Save space and time.	Boloka sebaka le nako.
Do not be such a child.	U se ke ua ba ngoana ea joalo.
It will be much better, much more.	E tla ba betere haholo, haholo.
I give you money, here.	Ke u fa chelete, mona.
So thank you for this.	Kahoo ke leboha sena.
We will always know almost nothing.	Re tla lula re tseba haufi le letho.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho joalo.
He dropped the matter.	O ile a tlohela taba eo.
He was simply not there.	O ne a le sieo feela.
I decided to quit school.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho tlohela sekolo.
I don't think any of you have that idea.	Ha ke nahane hore ha ho le ya mong wa lona ya nang le mohopolo oo.
I like singing.	Ke rata ho bina.
Of course, probably indeed.	Ha e le hantle, mohlomong ka sebele.
Too much.	E ngata haholo.
Before all of this, life used to be relatively simple.	Pele ho tsena tsohle, khale ha bophelo bo ne bo le bonolo.
I find it difficult to understand.	Ke fumana ho le thata ho utloisisa.
I looked at it once.	Ke ile ka e sheba hang.
He can't see very well.	Ha a bone hantle.
I had my own.	Ke ne ke e-na le ea ka.
At this time.	Ka nako ena.
I looked at the time again.	Ka sheba nako hape.
That is why it is so good.	Ke kahoo e leng molemo hakana.
The other man watched.	Monna e mong a shebella.
He just leaves.	O tloha feela.
Just this thing.	Ntho ena feela.
They really do.	Ba hlile ba e etsa.
No, he did not say anything.	Che, ha a ka a bua letho.
Great job.	Mosebetsi o moholo.
It was gone.	E ne e ile.
He would have to learn to anticipate his emotions.	O ne a tla tlameha ho ithuta ho lebella maikutlo a hae esale pele.
I wish it did.	Ke lakatsa eka e entse joalo.
I can tell people to do things.	Nka bolella batho ho etsa lintho.
Ask people.	Botsa batho.
You know, you seemed to fit in.	Ua tseba, u ne u bonahala u lekana.
I found this to be very helpful.	Ke fumane sena se thusa haholo.
It was amazing.	E ne e le tse makatsang.
I never forgot it.	Ke ne ke sa e lebala.
It was nothing new to me.	E ne e se ntho e ncha ho 'na.
It was probably too old.	Mohlomong e ne e le khale haholo.
It certainly did not endear him to her.	Ka sebele ho ne ho sa etse hore a mo rate hakaalo.
Here's the amazing thing.	Taba e makatsang ke ena.
Now I can start again.	Joale ke khona ho qala hape.
I couldn’t get past one of those things.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho feta ho e 'ngoe ea lintho tseo.
He did not know where he was.	O ne a sa tsebe moo a leng teng.
I told them we needed this room.	Ke ile ka ba bolella hore re hloka kamore ena.
As you say, money and power.	Joalo ka ha u re, chelete le matla.
He usually travels alone.	Hangata o tsamaea a le mong.
Working on it today.	Ho sebetsa ho eona kajeno.
There is a better way.	Ho na le tsela e 'ngoe e ntle ho feta.
Your opportunity will come.	Monyetla oa hau o tla tla.
Don't talk too much.	Se bue haholo.
A few days, a lot of weeks.	Matsatsi a 'maloa, beke le beke haholo.
He wanted to be something else.	O ne a batla ho ba ntho e 'ngoe hape.
And to this day.	Le ho fihlela kajeno.
We all got that, thank you.	Kaofela re fumane seo, kea leboha.
Someone to give it all.	Motho ea ho fa tsohle.
That is true.	Seo ke 'nete.
So thank you very much.	Kahoo ke leboha haholo.
And the money they make.	Le chelete eo ba e etsang.
It was for the best.	E ne e le bakeng sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
It will happen.	Ho tla etsahala.
However, there are other problems.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le mathata a mang.
I wanted to do something hard.	Ke ne ke batla ho etsa ntho e thata.
It can be very difficult.	E ka ba boima haholo.
I told you it couldn't be.	Ke o boleletse hore ho ke ke ha ba jwalo.
I would have refused him.	Nka be ke ile ka hana ho eena.
Would you like some coffee?	O ka thabela kofi e 'ngoe?
I want to spend time with you alone.	Ke batla nako le uena ke le mong.
You can try that.	O ka leka seo.
So people eat more.	Kahoo batho ba ja ho feta.
After about a few years, they came back and said.	Ka mor'a lilemo tse ka bang 'maloa, ba ile ba khutla 'me ba re.
You will love that, too.	O tla rata seo, le wena.
Do not treat them kindly.	U se ke ua ba tšoara hantle.
You need to know.	O lokela ho tseba.
Maybe it hurt.	Mohlomong e utloile bohloko.
And everything goes as it should.	'Me ntho e' ngoe le e 'ngoe e tsamaea kamoo e lokelang ho ba kateng.
It is the last of them.	Ke ho qetela ho bona.
He was one of them.	E ne e le e mong oa bona.
He refused to pay.	O ile a hana ho lefa.
I had no idea what he was talking about.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na o bua ka eng.
This is not the time to sit still.	Ena ha se nako ea ho lula feela.
Did you have that.	Na u bile le seo.
So, let's not say this.	Kahoo, ha re re sena.
I want to know everything.	Ke batla ho tseba tsohle.
And that means something.	Mme hoo ho bolela ho hong.
First of all, they can only help you save money.	Taba ea pele, li ka u thusa feela ho boloka chelete.
They told me it was time to go to bed.	Ba ile ba mpolella hore joale ke nako ea ho robala.
You can view the questions here.	O ka sheba lipotso mona.
But none of these helped.	Empa ha ho le e ’ngoe ea tsona e ileng ea thusa.
He was never close to leaving.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba haufi le ho tsamaea.
She saw the boy.	A bona moshanyana.
Anyone can say that.	Mang kapa mang a ka bolela seo.
I'm sorry, boy.	Ke masoabi, moshanyana.
He loves that and everyone.	O rata seo le bohle.
So that's a good thing.	Kahoo ntho e ntle.
So I played.	Kahoo ke ile ka bapala.
A really great guy.	Mohlankana e moholo ruri.
Then he met his friends.	Eaba o kopana le metsoalle ea hae.
I hear it every day.	Ke e utloa ka matsatsi a mang le a mang.
It must be close.	E tlameha ho ba haufi.
He did that.	O entse seo.
Three of them are for his production work.	Tse tharo tsa tsona ke tsa mosebetsi oa hae oa tlhahiso.
He is out.	O a tsoa.
It looks great.	E shebahala hantle.
Or they could not see without their problems.	Kapa ba ne ba sa bone ka ntle ho mathata a bona.
When a person is in danger.	Ha motho a le kotsing.
Time stopped.	Nako e ile ea ema.
But he also did not know why.	Empa le eena o ne a sa tsebe lebaka.
I could only pay you more than them.	Nka mpa ka le lefa ho feta bona.
I will do the same.	Le nna ke tla etsa jwalo.
Most of all, take your son with you.	Haholo, nka mora wa hao le wena.
When he arrived, the police were already there.	Ha a fihla, mapolesa a ne a se a ntse a le teng.
If not, they should be.	Haeba ha ho joalo, ba lokela ho ba joalo.
Almost all of us.	Hoo e ka bang kaofela ha rōna.
We get nothing.	Ha re fumane letho.
This works well for some people.	Sena se sebetsa hantle ho batho ba bang.
I am very professional.	Ke setsebi haholo.
That is, if you really want to go back home.	Ke hore, haeba u hlile u batla ho khutlela hae.
And it came out very simple.	'Me e ile ea tla e bonolo haholo.
I really have it.	Ke hlile ke na le eona.
Enter.	Kena.
He drank coffee.	O ile a noa kofi.
Nothing old.	Ha ho letho la khale.
All you have to do is ask.	Seo u lokelang ho se etsa ke ho botsa.
Here he had everything he needed.	Mona o ne a e-na le sohle seo a se hlokang.
He did not know what to do with it all.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng ka eona kaofela.
That was a good thing.	Eo e ne e le ntho e ntle.
I went to your house.	Ke ile ha hao.
Traveling requires money.	Ho tsamaea ho hloka chelete.
You have no money to do it.	Ha u na chelete ea ho e etsa.
I finished second.	Ke ile ka qeta ea bobeli.
However, it may not do this.	Leha ho le joalo, e ka 'na ea se ke ea etsa sena.
I have done more than anyone.	Ke entse ho feta mang kapa mang.
She's not very pretty.	Ha a motle haholo.
Have a nice day.	Eba le letsatsi le monate.
You had to be tough.	U ne u tlameha ho ba thata.
That’s where you have it.	Ke moo u nang le eona.
It looks fun.	E shebahala e le monate.
There was no problem.	Ho ne ho se bothata.
No one should do that.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho etsa joalo.
I made it, and it's not good.	Ke e entse, mme ha e ntle.
However, that was years ago.	Leha ho le joalo, hoo e ne e le lilemo tse fetileng.
Then the fall.	Joale ho oa.
We wanted to find it and spent the night there.	Re ne re batla ho e fumana ’me ra hlola bosiu moo.
He considered him a son.	O ne a mo nka e le mora.
So he said it.	Kahoo a e bua.
They don't care much.	Ha ba na taba haholo.
And it is very good.	'Me e ntle haholo.
She was so beautiful.	O ne a le motle haholo.
He took it very well.	O e nkile hantle haholo.
There is no way he can love her.	Ha ho kamoo a ka mo ratang kateng.
It's not a phone line nearby.	Ha se le mohala o haufi.
There are others too.	Ho na le ba bang hape.
I am real, true.	'Na oa 'nete, oa 'nete.
That was not important now.	Seo e ne e se sa bohlokoa hona joale.
You have no chance of that.	Ha o na monyetla oa seo.
This is still true.	Sena e ntse e le 'nete.
We like to have things.	Re rata ho ba le lintho.
Really, thank you.	Ruri, kea leboha.
I'm glad you, that you have it.	Ke thabetse uena, hore o na le eona.
You and thirty people coming.	Wena le batho ba mashome a mararo ba tlang.
Almost everyone in this area is illiterate.	Hoo e ka bang motho e mong le e mong sebakeng sena ha a tsebe ho bala le ho ngola.
He is doing it alone.	O ntse a e etsa a le mong.
He did not know why.	O ne a sa tsebe lebaka.
All and all.	Tsohle le bohle.
I want you very much.	Ke u batla haholo.
This is very good.	Sena se setle haholo.
Life for life.	Bophelo bakeng sa bophelo.
And it goes to work.	'Me e ea sebetsa.
Some of them are still doing so.	Ba bang ba bona ba ntse ba etsa joalo.
That thing is dangerous.	Ntho eo e kotsi.
And they used to do that.	Mme ba kile ba etsa jwalo.
I didn't think much of it.	Ke ne ke sa nahane haholo.
I live here now.	Ke lula mona hona joale.
No one looked like him.	Ha ho motho ea neng a shebahala joaloka eena.
Get out before he gets home.	Tsoa pele a fihla hae.
The image was there again.	Setšoantšo se ne se le teng hape.
You only need me and me.	O hloka nna le nna feela.
He wanted something.	O ne a batla ntho e itseng.
We used to do it even before he paid.	Re ne re qala ho e etsa le pele a lefa.
Girl look.	Ngoanana sheba.
I think we became friends after that.	Ke nahana hore re ile ra ba metsoalle ka mor'a moo.
He is a big boy now.	Ke moshanyana e moholo jwale.
Eventually he will win.	Qetellong o tla hlola.
I hope they can.	Ke tšepa ba ka khona.
Let's not talk about it anymore.	Ha re bue ka eona hape.
I had no idea.	Ke ne ke sa nahane ka letho.
He told her what he wanted to hear.	O ile a mo bolella seo a batlang ho se utloa.
I had never been there, and I would not be here for long.	Ke ne ke e-s'o be teng, 'me ke ne ke sa tla ba teng nako e telele.
We love him more than our parents.	Re mo rata ho feta batsoali ba rona.
However, keeping it that way, it is very difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, ho boloka ho le joalo, ho thata haholo.
He had been loving her all this time.	O ne a ntse a mo rata ka nako ena kaofela.
However, the problem persists.	Leha ho le joalo, bothata bo ntse bo le teng.
This was happening when the police arrived.	Sena se ne se etsahala ha mapolesa a fihla.
It was easy to get water and keep it hard.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho fumana metsi le ho boloka ho le thata.
One for each of us.	E 'ngoe bakeng sa e mong le e mong oa rona.
I really needed the money.	Ke ne ke hlile ke hloka chelete.
I can't talk too much about it here.	Ha ke khone ho bua haholo ka eona mona.
He will live with me.	O tla phela le nna.
This is your great opportunity.	Ona ke monyetla oa hau o moholo.
That can be important.	Seo se ka ba bohlokoa.
If it works for you it will work.	Haeba e sebetsa ho uena e ea sebetsa.
He went.	O ile.
I wanted to talk.	Ke ne ke batla ho bua.
You go, you.	O ya, wena.
But to be with him was a great man.	Empa ho ba le eena e ne e le monna e moholo ho ne ho hlokahala.
Thanks in advance.	Ke leboha esale pele.
We can all find a way to stay alone.	Kaofela re ka fumana tsela ea ho lula re le bang.
It's easy, when you eat, just eat.	Ho bonolo feela, ha o ja, ja feela.
It did not happen overnight and it was not easy.	Ha ea ka ea etsahala ka letsatsi le le leng 'me ho ne ho se bonolo.
If you have things to do, do them.	Haeba u na le lintho tseo u lokelang ho li etsa, li etse.
We are going to have dinner.	Re il'o ja lijo tsa mantsiboea.
Absolutely no question.	Ho hang ntle ho potso.
His and yours.	Ea hae le ea hau.
Most people are not able to do that.	Batho ba bangata ha ba khone ho etsa joalo.
Do not believe anything.	U se ke ua lumela letho.
That's their life, that's their life.	Ke bophelo ba bona boo, ke bophelo ba bona.
He had met a girl.	O ne a kopane le ngoanana.
You do it again.	U e etsa hape.
That is where the problem lies.	Ke hona moo bothata bo leng teng.
I'm sure, they do.	Ke na le bonnete, ba etsa joalo.
I'm not sure how that will work.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na seo se tla sebetsa joang.
I did not know when she would be.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore o tla ba neng.
I had to come back to see you when you left.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho khutla ho tla u bona ha u tsamaea.
It is far better to preach the good news in advance.	Ho molemo haholo ho bolela litaba tse molemo esale pele.
But that certainly meant that he too did not know the truth.	Empa ka sebele seo se ne se bolela hore le eena o ne a sa tsebe ’nete.
You should finish that, tonight.	O lokela ho qeta seo, bosiung bona.
The last thing.	Ntho ea ho qetela.
It seems.	Ho bonahala eka.
I wonder how easy it is.	Kea ipotsa hore na ho bonolo ke eng.
That's not good for you, young man.	Seo ha se setle ho wena, mohlankana.
I almost got close.	Ke ile ka batla ke le haufi.
There is no time to see everything, just what matters.	Ha ho na nako ea ho bona ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe, feela se bohlokoa.
It would be easy to see them.	Ho ne ho tla ba bonolo ho li bona.
Get out of there.	Tloha moo.
Please read each question carefully.	Ka kopo bala potso e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ka hloko.
Well, that's exactly what it is.	Be, ke seo e leng sona hantle.
I'll have to look at it.	Ke tla tlameha ho e sheba.
You have to walk carefully.	U tlameha ho tsamaea ka hloko.
Of course he had it.	Ehlile o ne a e-na le eona.
But it is no longer there.	Empa ha e sa le eo.
I could not be that.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ba joalo.
That is the first thing you do.	Ke ntho ya pele eo o e etsang.
It no longer hurts.	Ha e sa hlola e utloa bohloko.
I really don't know.	Ka 'nete ha ke tsebe.
Good job for the player.	Mosebetsi o molemo bakeng sa sebapali.
I was glad to see her.	Ke ile ka thabela ho mo bona.
That is what is happening here.	Ke sona se etsahalang mona.
After that day he didn't really think about me.	Ka mor'a letsatsi leo o ne a sa nahane hakaalo ka 'na.
Nothing would be easier.	Ha ho letho le neng le tla ba bonolo.
Just last week as a matter of fact.	Hantle feela bekeng e fetileng joalo ka taba ea 'nete.
I will provide that.	Ke tla fana ka seo.
No one would have thought that he would.	Ha ho motho ea ka nahanang hore o ne a tla etsa joalo.
He was in his room.	O ne a le ka kamoreng ea hae.
The woman said they would help.	Mosali o itse ba tla thusa.
I couldn’t take more.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho nka ho feta.
We are now friends.	Hona joale re metsoalle.
He is in great danger.	O kotsing haholo.
I can't even imagine how we did it.	Ha ke khone le ho nahana hore na re e entse joang.
We'll think of something else.	Re tla nahana ka se seng.
Nearby kids love to play here.	Bana ba haufi ba rata ho bapala mona.
If you need something, you have to ask.	Haeba u hloka ho hong, u tlameha ho botsa.
I've heard it, everybody has heard it.	Ke e utloile, bohle ba e utloile.
There was no sense in it anymore.	Ho ne ho se ho se na kelello ho eona hape.
Kids love to play with their food.	Bana ba rata ho bapala ka lijo tsa bona.
That is what they need.	Ke seo ba se hlokang.
It's so fun when you come in.	Ho monate haholo ha o kena.
He spends most of his time away.	O qeta nako e ngata a le sieo.
And then they won't be there.	'Me joale ba ke ke ba ba teng.
He was always good to me.	O ne a le molemo ho nna kamehla.
And they did just that.	Mme ba etsa sona seo.
However, you have your husband.	Leha ho le joalo, u na le monna oa hau.
They all begin to talk.	Bohle ba qala ho bua.
Do you realize what you are doing?	Na o hlokomela seo o se etsang?
What would happen to my hair.	Ho ne ho tla etsahala'ng ka moriri oa ka.
Finally they entered on foot.	Qetellong ba kena ka maoto.
So much for me.	Haholo bakeng sa ka.
They become lifelong friends.	E ba metsoalle ea bophelo bohle.
But he refused to come.	Empa e ne e hana ho tla.
I can't do it right now.	Ha ke khone ho e etsa hona joale.
It is only a matter of time.	Ke taba ea nako feela.
He could sing.	O ne a khona ho bina.
This was important.	Sena se ne se le bohlokoa.
Or maybe there is something else you would like to try.	Kapa mohlomong ho na le ntho e 'ngoe eo u ka ratang ho e leka.
But that would be much easier.	Empa hoo ho ne ho tla ba bonolo haholo.
And so we just know.	Mme ka hona re tseba feela.
From the beginning.	Ho tloha pele.
He got it right.	O e fumane hantle.
He wanted to feel strong.	O ne a batla ho ikutloa a le matla.
But this method is not very effective.	Empa mokhoa ona ha o na thuso haholo.
I always do that.	Ke dula ke etsa seo.
Tell your friends.	Bolella metsoalle ea hau.
Or he had made time.	Kapa o ne a entse nako.
Well, very much.	Hantle, haholo.
They must be handled properly.	Li tlameha ho tšoaroa hantle.
It was not something he did for her.	E ne e se ntho eo a neng a mo etsetsa eona.
People understand this very well.	Batho ba utloisisa sena hantle.
We have been there.	Re bile teng.
I will find out.	Ke tla fumana.
I can't tell you how to live your life.	Ha ke khone ho u bolella mokhoa oa ho phela bophelo ba hau.
Everyone was going to sleep there tonight for the first time.	Bohle ba ne ba tla robala moo bosiung bona lekhetlo la pele.
Maybe we should go for a swim.	Mohlomong re lokela ho ea sesa.
I think you knew.	Ke nahana hore o ne o tseba.
How do you keep your stuff in these.	U boloka lintho tsa hau joang ho tse.
It was his time.	E ne e le nako ya hae.
You do not know when your last day of play will be.	Ha u tsebe hore na letsatsi la hau la ho qetela la ho bapala le tla ba neng.
And the fact of the matter is that we went very quickly.	'Me 'nete ea taba ke hore re ile ra ea kapele haholo.
I'm just trying to win.	Ke mpa ke leka ho hlola.
He can't have both.	A ke ke a ba le bobeli.
I am very happy with it.	Ke thabile haholo ka eona.
I don't need that now.	Ha ke hloke seo ha jwale.
I would like to read a book.	Ke kopa ho bala buka.
When you love someone, you trust them.	Ha u rata motho, ua mo tšepa.
He was done.	O ne a qetile.
This place should not be occupied.	Sebaka sena ha sea lokela ho lula.
He was telling the group about things to come.	O ne a bolella sehlopha ka lintho tse tlang ho tla.
No one else passed.	Ha ho motho e mong ea ileng a feta.
She will have a son.	O tla ba le mora.
I mean I am.	Ke bolela hore ke.
I can get it.	Nka e fumana.
There must be danger.	Ho tlameha ho ba le kotsi.
And now my family is gone.	Mme jwale lelapa la ka le ile.
We are not at home at all.	Ho hang ha re hae.
He was only about thirty years old.	O ne a le lilemo li ka bang mashome a mararo feela.
I would come and get them.	Ke ne ke tla tla ho li nka.
I just grabbed him and grabbed him.	Ke ile ka mo tšoara feela ka mo tšoara.
I did not know where to go or where to go.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke ee hokae kapa ke ee hokae.
As long as you can imagine.	Ha feela o ka nahana.
That makes you think.	Seo se etsa hore o nahane.
But some of them refused.	Empa ba bang ba bona ba ile ba hana.
He was the last of his kind.	E ne e le eena oa ho qetela oa mofuta oa hae.
I have no time for such things.	Ha ke na nako ea lintho tse joalo.
The sooner you do this, the better.	Ha o etsa sena kapele, o tla ba betere.
While some people find that to be true, many do not.	Le hoja batho ba bang ba fumana seo e le ’nete, ba bangata ha ba etse joalo.
Anything could happen.	Eng kapa eng e ne e ka etsahala.
However, no one else thought so.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho e mong ea neng a nahana joalo.
The baby is beautiful.	Ngoana e motle.
It is a mental memory.	Ke mohopolo oa mohopolo.
He walked away from me.	O ile a tsamaea ho 'na.
Some have other ideas.	Ba bang ba na le maikutlo a mang.
I am sure of it.	Ke na le bonnete ba eona.
I really didn't want anything.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa batle letho.
I went to the strange police.	Ke ile ho mapolesa a makatsang.
He could not be sure.	O ne a ka se be le bonnete.
Before you speak, think first.	Pele u bua, nahana pele.
As long as we need to be like that.	Ha feela re hloka ho ba joalo.
Your feelings are very strong.	Maikutlo a hau a matla haholo.
I could see water.	Ke ne ke bona metsi.
It was in the sun.	E ne e le ka letsatsi.
I don't care about work.	Ha ke tsotelle mosebetsi.
I don't even know him.	Ha ke mo tsebe le ho mo tseba.
I was not thinking well.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hantle.
We got it.	Re e fumane.
Did he try to find out.	Na o ile a leka ho fumana.
Probably the last time.	Mohlomong ke lekhetlo la ho qetela.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
Probably for money.	Mohlomong bakeng sa chelete.
And it's very simple.	'Me e bonolo haholo.
Gently, they opened the door.	Ka bonolo, ba ile ba bula lemati.
Now he does.	Hona joale o etsa joalo.
If he wants to.	Haeba a batla.
'of'.	'ea'.
He asks her to speak.	O mo kōpa hore a bue.
Not necessarily simple but useful.	Ha se hakaalo hore e bonolo empa e na le thuso.
They were afraid to say anything.	Ba ne ba tšaba ho bua letho.
And they were.	Mme ba ne ba le jwalo.
He does not know how to make things happen.	Ha a tsebe ho etsa hore lintho li be teng.
He could have caught her if he wanted to.	O ne a ka mo tšoara ha a batla.
So it means.	Kahoo ho bolela.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
Yes of course.	Ehlile, ho joalo.
It does not seem to work.	Ha e bonahale e sebetsa.
That's right, that's right.	Ho joalo, ho joalo.
Whatever they do, they do it together.	Eng kapa eng eo ba e etsang, ba e etsa hammoho.
But someone loved him.	Mme motho o ne a mo rata.
Well a man can be.	Hantle monna a ka ba jwalo.
But the situation is what it is.	Empa boemo bona ke hore na bo joang.
But now you are mine.	Empa joale u oa ka.
I just had to be sure.	Ke ne ke tlameha feela ho ba le bonnete.
Then someone said.	Eaba motho e mong o re.
I was doing that.	Ke ne ke ntse ke etsa joalo.
He must have done that.	E tlameha ebe ke eena ea li entseng.
Now here is my problem.	Joale bothata ba ka ke bona.
It just means.	E bolela feela.
I really liked it at the time.	Ke ne ke e rata haholo ka nako eo.
He really enjoyed the party.	O ile a thabela mokete oo haholo.
It was not a fun process.	E ne e se mokhoa o monate.
I understand why it is important.	Kea utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha e le bohlokoa.
Emotional people.	Batho ba nang le maikutlo.
He refused to open it.	A hana ho e bula.
Keep this book valuable.	Boloka buka ena e le ea bohlokoa.
I can't do it.	Ha ke khone ho e etsa.
Probably not all of it.	Mohlomong ha se eona kaofela.
No one thought they were good.	Ha ho motho ea neng a nahana hore li ntle.
This offers a very good opportunity.	Sena se fana ka monyetla o motle haholo.
Also, spend time outdoors with your child.	Hape, qeta nako u le ka ntle le ngoana oa hao.
I know they will enjoy this.	Kea tseba hore ba tla thabela sena.
When they got there, the group was empty.	Ha ba fihla moo, sehlopha se ne se se na letho.
He was very happy.	O ne a thabile haholo.
He had too much.	O ne a e-na le e ngata haholo.
Just think, no one has ever lived your life before.	Nahana feela, ha ho motho ea kileng a phela bophelo ba hau pele.
He would make a good team.	O ne a tla etsa sehlopha se setle.
No one our age was getting into it.	Ho ne ho se motho oa lilemo tsa rona ea neng a kena ho eona.
Stay in them.	Dula ho tsona.
I used to work hard.	Ke tloaetse ho sebetsa ka thata.
Whether they like it or not.	Hore na ba rata kapa che.
You could understand them.	U ne u ka li utloisisa.
Sit down.	Lula fatše.
You may have wondered why.	E ka ’na eaba u kile ua ipotsa hore na ke hobane’ng.
Keep up the good content.	Tsoela pele ka sebaka se setle.
Everyone here loves it.	Motho e mong le e mong mona oa e rata.
Yet people are still going there.	Leha ho le joalo batho ba ntse ba ea moo.
There was something strange about it.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho e makatsang ka eona.
I know the place better than you do.	Ke tseba sebaka seo hantle ho u feta.
I really decided that.	Ka sebele ke ile ka etsa qeto ea hore.
Sometimes a good thing is too good to be true.	Ka linako tse ling ntho e ntle e ntle haholo hore e ka ba 'nete.
I use them for that reason.	Ke li sebelisa ka lebaka leo.
What you need is what you need.	Seo u se hlokang ke seo u se hlokang.
Get out! 	Tsoa!
If you do well.	Haeba u etsa hantle.
They have been here for three years now.	E se e le lilemo tse tharo ba le mona.
It wasn't, of course.	E ne e se, ehlile.
It's that simple.	Ho bonolo joalo.
John at the time.	John ka nako eo.
Or maybe you would.	Kapa mohlomong u ne u tla.
It was the first time he had done so.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele a etsa joalo.
That makes it my time.	Seo se etsa hore e be nako ea ka.
They are no longer in a position.	Ha ba sa na boemo.
None of us.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona.
So, there are things like that.	Ka hona, ho na le lintho tse joalo.
It was there before and we opened it again.	E ne e le teng pele mme re ile ra e bula hape.
I will fix them, he thought.	Ke tla li lokisa, a nahana joalo.
No, it was not everywhere.	Che, e ne e se kae kapa kae.
Of course he does.	Ehlile o etsa jwalo.
I think they are, but probably not for everyone.	Ke nahana hore li joalo, empa mohlomong ha se tsa motho e mong le e mong.
Her teacher spoke again.	Tichere ea hae ea bua hape.
It is never too late.	Ha ho mohla morao haholo.
However, there must be a better way to do this.	Leha ho le joalo, ho tlameha ho be le tsela e betere ea ho etsa sena.
But it was always there.	Empa e ne e le teng kamehla.
And that would be very difficult.	Le hoo ho ne ho tla ba thata haholo.
Not so with everyone.	Ha ho joalo ho bohle.
But, he was just saying what most people think.	Empa, o ne a bua feela seo batho ba bangata ba se nahanang.
Nobody there.	Haho motho moo.
I opened them, of course.	Ke ile ka li bula, ehlile.
He continued to play until the end of his life.	O ile a tsoela pele ho bapala ho fihlela qetellong ea bophelo ba hae.
I had no life before you.	Ke ne ke sena bophelo pele ho uena.
They are busy.	Ba phathahane.
Keep up the good work.	Tsoela pele ka mosebetsi o motle.
He did not, although he was quick.	Ha aa ka a etsa joalo, leha a ne a le kapele.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Ke masoabi ho utloa seo.
And it has a nice room.	'Me e na le kamore e ntle.
This is a great way to spend a morning.	Ena ke tsela e ntle ea ho qeta hoseng.
But he did.	Empa o ile a etsa joalo.
Any help? 	Thuso efe kapa efe?
thank you.	leboha.
She wanted to cry.	O ne a batla ho lla.
He did his job.	O entse mosebetsi oa hae.
I went back to the room.	Ke ile ka khutlela kamoreng.
The first is family.	Ea pele ke lelapa.
He was really alone now.	O ne a hlile a le mong joale.
We will just live.	Re tla phela feela.
Now at this time.	Hona joale ka nako ena.
I'm right here.	Ke hantle mona.
Yet that is not the only reason.	Leha ho le joalo seo ha se lebaka feela.
He did just that.	O ile a etsa joalo.
It looked good.	E ne e shebahala e le ntle.
He has been busy.	Esale a phathahane.
It's that simple.	Ho bonolo joalo.
In one place, leave.	Sebakeng se le seng, tloha.
I just looked at them.	Ke ile ka ba sheba feela.
It is a very important question.	Ke potso ea bohlokoa haholo.
I wish we could have seen more.	Ke lakatsa eka re ka be re bone ho feta.
First, have coffee.	Pele, noa kofi.
We are about to leave.	Re se re tla tloha.
Those were some of the happiest times.	Tseo e ne e le tse ling tsa linako tse monate ka ho fetisisa.
I doubt that very much.	Ke belaela hoo haholo.
Then he sat down.	Eaba o lula fatše.
Once you have it, you have it.	Hang ha u e-na le eona, u na le eona.
You had to go and visit.	U ne u tlameha ho ea etela ebe u tsamaea.
This is not the time.	Ha se nako.
Many just love him.	Ba bangata ba mo rata feela.
Then they had children.	Eaba ba fumana bana.
I was alone.	Ke ne ke le mong.
He did not try to find out what happened.	Ha aa ka a leka ho fumana se etsahetseng.
She needs him very much.	O mo hloka haholo.
Last time for you.	Nako ea ho qetela bakeng sa hau.
It was too late.	E ne e se e le morao haholo.
I think you can still.	Ke nahana hore u ntse u ka khona.
I can't say.	Ha ke khone ho bolela.
Same people.	Batho ba tšoanang.
He knew they could not survive.	O ne a tseba hore ba ke ke ba phela.
If he can get enough time he will be an adult.	Haeba a ka fumana nako e lekaneng e tla ba motho e moholo.
What do you do?.	U etsa eng?.
However it was not.	Leha ho ne ho se joalo.
But then he could not.	Empa joale o ne a sa khone.
It can start here.	Eka qala mona.
However, these are not the same.	Leha ho le joalo, hase hore tsena ke ntho e tšoanang.
You have a wife and child.	U na le mosali le ngoana.
He did not want to be anywhere.	O ne a sa batle ho ba kae kapa kae.
You have to try it.	O tlameha ho e leka.
I give you some good ones to think about.	Ke u fa tse ling tse ntle tseo u ka nahanang ka tsona.
So, what's wrong with him?	Joale, phoso ke efe ka eena?
This was really good.	Sena se ne se hlile se le molemo.
You just have enough time.	U na le nako e lekaneng feela.
We are very happy to read this book.	Re thabetse ho bala buka ena haholo.
People do this.	Batho ba etsa sena.
Only, it was there.	Feela, e ne e le teng.
Of course, that is not the case.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho joalo.
When will that life begin again?	Bophelo boo bo tla qala neng hape?
You do not know what is going on down here.	Ha u tsebe se etsahalang mona fatše.
I like things.	Ke rata lintho.
I hope to come back but the question is when.	Ke tšepa ho khutla empa potso ke neng.
Probably years ago.	Mohlomong lilemo tse fetileng.
I often feel tired in the morning.	Hangata ke ikutloa ke khathetse hoseng.
That was the best time of the day.	Eo e ne e le nako e ntle ka ho fetisisa ea letsatsi le leng le le leng.
He was not going to tell me.	O ne a sa tlo mpolella.
I just played it.	Ke sa tsoa e bapala.
I had no idea what to say.	Ke ne ke sa nahane letho leo nka le buang.
We’ve had a lot going on over the last year.	Re bile le lintho tse ngata selemong sena se fetileng.
That is not a problem for you.	Seo ha se bothata ho uena.
Hands, he thought.	Matsoho, a nahana.
It was better.	Ho ne ho le betere.
We feel very happy about that.	Re ikutloa re thabile haholo ka seo.
Her husband stopped short as soon as he saw her.	Monna oa hae o ile a ema hang ha a mo bona.
Then he thought about it.	Joale o ile a nahana ka eona.
We can't go back now.	Ha re khone ho khutlela morao hona joale.
Also, simple things.	Hape, lintho tse bonolo.
It will not give anything.	E ke ke ea fana ka letho.
She is ugly.	O mpe.
It was hard, it was hard, it was hard.	Ho ne ho le thata, ho le thata, ho le thata.
You work with your emotions.	U sebetsa ka maikutlo a hau.
We went on living our lives.	Re ile ra tsoela pele ho phela bophelo ba rōna.
I love him but I don’t know how to do it.	Kea mo rata empa ha ke tsebe hore na ke etse joang.
Friends must stand with friends.	Metsoalle e tlameha ho ema le metsoalle.
I need time to think about it.	Ke hloka nako ea ho nahana ka eona.
I will take her.	Ke tla mo nka.
Some people can't.	Batho ba bang ha ba khone.
But do not ask him about it.	Empa u se ke ua mo botsa ka taba eo.
We will learn to do.	Re tla ithuta ho etsa.
But he can't do that.	Empa ha a khone ho etsa joalo.
People will come out.	Batho ba tla tsoa.
He didn't look like that.	O ne a sa bonahale jwalo.
Even though he didn't have it, he didn't care.	Leha a ne a se na, o ne a sa tsotelle.
I just wanted to see something, whatever, happen.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho bona ntho, eng kapa eng, e etsahala.
The law is very clear on that.	Molao o hlakile haholo ka seo.
No, never.	Che, ha ho mohla.
My wife, you are in pain.	Mosali oa ka, o utloile bohloko.
Children learn to walk	Bana ba ithuta ho tsamaea
He just doesn't know nothing.	O mpa a sa tsebe letho.
And so it was not enough to know.	Mme ka hona ho ne ho sa lekana ho tseba.
We can stay.	Re ka lula.
You are not alone.	Ha se uena feela.
I would give him everything.	Ke ne ke tla mo fa tsohle.
I know how to win.	Ke tseba ho hlola.
I knew we had no chance.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ha re na monyetla.
But it is probably not as difficult as it seems.	Empa mohlomong ha ho thata joalo ka ha ho bonahala.
His mental state was clear.	Boemo ba hae ba kelello bo ne bo hlakile.
Go and get them !.	Tsamaea o ba nke!.
Here comes the problem.	Mona ho tla mathata.
Thank you very much.	Ke leboha haholo.
You just have to know him.	O tlameha feela ho mo tseba.
But it did not help.	Empa ha ea ka ea thusa letho.
No, I haven't got it yet.	Che, ha ke so fumane.
They went home and slept.	Ba ile ba ya hae mme ba robala.
And all the other things they do.	Le lintho tse ling tsohle tseo ba li etsang.
It is not a real problem.	Ha se bothata ba sebele.
She has no job.	Ha a na mosebetsi.
He will never come again.	Ha a sa tla hape.
Both would go on.	Bobeli ba ne ba tla tsoela pele.
You did not want it.	U ne u sa e batle.
It's up to you.	E na le uena.
You don't have to.	Ha o a tlameha.
My mother might read it.	’Mè a ka ’na a e bala.
It's bad then.	E mpe ka nako eo.
And a child.	Le ngoana.
They live here.	Ba lula mona.
And he does not want to be.	'Me ha a batle ho ba eena.
They wanted to give him a letter.	Ba ne ba batla ho mo fa lengolo.
I was with them.	Ke ne ke na le bona.
Sign in regularly.	Kena ho ea kamehla.
And it is certainly very easy for a man.	'Me ka sebele ho bonolo haholo ho monna.
I think he will be coming soon.	Ke nahana hore o tla fihla haufinyane.
Because that's what he is.	Hobane ke seo a leng sona.
It does not speak strongly for this proposal.	Ha e bue ka matla bakeng sa tlhahiso ena.
It was beyond the reach of human power.	E ne e feta matla a motho leha e le ofe.
Don't think, just do it !.	U se ke ua nahana, etsa feela!.
Everything is going well so far.	Tsohle li ntse li tsamaea hantle ho fihlela joale.
I know he exists, and so do others.	Kea tseba hore o teng, le ba bang hape.
Writing is still an issue.	Ho ngola e ntse e le taba.
He looked at her in amazement.	O ile a mo sheba ka mokhoa o makatsang.
But for everyone.	Empa bakeng sa bohle.
Do nothing about such people.	U se ke ua etsa letho ka batho ba joalo.
But you just have to let it go.	Empa o tlameha feela ho e tlohela.
You had a chance.	U bile le monyetla.
However, thank you for your time.	Leha ho le joalo, ke leboha nako ea hau.
He knew he didn't have to.	O ne a tseba hore ha a lokela.
I will definitely be back soon.	Ka sebele ke tla khutla haufinyane.
I could not see where he did this.	Ke ne ke sa bone moo o entseng ntho ena.
It's his whole life.	Ke bophelo bohle ba hae.
I feel like they know we exist.	Ke bona eka baa tseba hore re teng.
Her hands helped her stand up.	Matsoho a hae a mo thusa ho ema.
He had never done this before.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa sena pele.
We both did.	Ka bobeli re ile ra etsa joalo.
He said he had it.	O itse o na le eona.
We are not talking about this here.	Ha re bue ka taba ena mona.
I felt good about it.	Ke ne ke ikutloa hantle ka eona.
You look nice.	O shebahala hantle.
They move fast and are hard to see.	Li tsamaea kapele ’me li thata ho li bona.
It should work well now.	E lokela ho sebetsa hantle hona joale.
He has time, and more.	O na le nako, le tse ngata.
And walking.	Le ho tsamaea.
he kept wondering.	a nna a ipotsa.
I did not think this would work.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore sena se tla sebetsa.
We must keep going.	Re tlameha ho tsoela pele re tsamaea.
I believe that.	Ke lumela seo.
But he also would not want to stay anywhere.	Empa le eena o ne a ke ke a batla ho lula kae kapa kae.
Anyone can do that.	Mang kapa mang a ka etsa seo.
The task is not as simple as it looks.	Mosebetsi ha o bonolo joalo ka ha o shebahala.
It's dangerous.	Ke kotsi.
No, maybe not this kind of thing right.	Che, mohlomong ha se ntho ea mofuta ona hantle.
That's a good enough picture.	Ke setšoantšo se lekaneng.
I can't understand this.	Ha ke khone ho utloisisa sena.
It's hard for me to see another benefit.	Ho thata ho 'na ho bona molemo o mong.
Traveling was fun.	Ho tsamaea ho ne ho le monate.
Then, perhaps, learn some things.	Ka nako eo, mohlomong, ho ithuta lintho tse ling.
He did not comment.	Ha a ka a fana ka maikutlo.
It seemed for hours.	Ho ne ho bonahala lihora.
They do it and they don't think about it.	Ba e etsa mme ha ba e nahane.
What did I ask for.	Ke ile ka kopa eng.
They are all friends.	Kaofela ke metsoalle.
And living is.	Le ho phela ke.
I hope it was not painful to read.	Ke tšepa hore e ne e se bohloko ho bala.
Please don't go, please stay.	Ke kopa o seke oa tsamaea, ke kopa o lule.
But only then.	Empa feela ka nako eo.
I don't need another reason.	Ha ke hloke lebaka le leng hape.
It never has been, and never will be.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ya ba teng, mme ha ho mohla e tla etsa jwalo.
Because we have a problem.	Hobane re na le bothata.
He took it very quickly.	O ile a e nka kapele haholo.
He needed to know.	O ne a hloka ho tseba.
I have never seen so many.	Ha ke eso bone tse ngata hakana.
When will you return to work?	U tla khutlela neng mosebetsing?
But no one could.	Empa ha ho motho ea neng a ka khona.
Who he was.	E ne e le mang.
Next.	E 'ngoe.
I can give you a job.	Nka u fa mosebetsi.
The young man talked to the girl.	Mohlankana o ile a bua le ngoanana eo.
He looked at them hard.	A ba sheba ka thata.
I had no idea where we were.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na re hokae.
They are only for the day.	Ke tsa letsatsi feela.
The method is much better.	Mokhoa o betere haholo.
He took it as an opportunity.	O ile a e nka e le monyetla.
I spent the day.	Ke qetile letsatsi.
They are still strong.	Ba ntse ba le matla.
Her husband, Father, had been a doctor.	Monna oa hae, Ntate, e ne e kile ea e-ba ngaka.
I need to know better.	Ke lokela ho tseba betere.
Maybe he heard her.	Mohlomong o ile a mo utloa.
Then it was my turn.	Joale e ne e le nako ea ka.
Then for a long time it was difficult.	Ebe ke nako e telele e boima.
Now.	Hona joale.
However, the problem persists.	Leha ho le joalo, bothata bo ntse bo le teng.
Yes, he thought.	E, o ile a nahana.
It was no surprise.	E ne e se kopo e makatsang.
Our friends may not yet know that we are going to see them.	Metsoalle ea rona e ka 'na eaba ha e e-s'o tsebe hore re ea ho bona.
We must think beforehand.	Re tlameha ho nahana esale pele.
Now no one is doing that, and things are looking good.	Hona joale ha ho motho ea etsang joalo, 'me lintho li shebahala hantle.
I was as happy as I could be.	Ke ne ke thabile kamoo nka khonang.
I'm not sure they ever existed.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore ba kile ba ba teng.
You want to stay in the family circle.	U batla ho lula u le ngoana oa lelapa.
I had to learn to trust people again.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho ithuta ho tšepa batho hape.
That was the reason.	E ne e le lebaka leo.
You can see and hear it all here, too.	U ka bona le ho utloa tsohle mona, hape.
Otherwise, it would not have been so.	Ho seng joalo, ho ka be ho se joalo.
No regrets.	Ha ho na masoabi.
Not even wanting to.	Leha e le ho batla ho.
Writing is difficult for some people.	Ho ngola ho thata ho batho ba bang.
I just love these.	Ke rata tsena feela.
Your life is important to us.	Bophelo ba hau bo bohlokoa ho rona.
Nothing was easy.	Ha ho letho le neng le le bonolo.
There are many of them.	Ho na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
So more than from.	Kahoo ho feta ho tloha.
Behind the tough guy is a professional.	Ka mor'a mohlankana ea thata ho na le setsebi.
Of course not.	Ehlile ha o etse jwalo.
None of them had ever seen or heard anything.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa bona ea kileng a bona kapa a utloa letho.
If he had made a decision, he too had made a decision.	Haeba a ne a entse qeto, le eena o ne a entse qeto.
I will try the fun.	Ke tla leka monate.
And all of them have never made a decision.	'Me kaofela ha bona ba e-s'o ka ba etsa qeto.
It never left.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea tloha.
To the man.	Ho monna.
But something happened.	Empa ho ile ha etsahala ntho e itseng.
He needed to know.	O ne a lokela ho tseba.
I hope you still enjoy it.	Ke tšepa hore leha ho le joalo u tla e thabela.
I wanted to be with you, to see why.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba le uena, ho bona lebaka.
He enjoyed the work.	O ne a thabela mosebetsi oo.
But that is often the only way.	Empa hangata ke eona feela tsela.
Unless it is a person.	Ntle le haeba e le motho.
The last few days were fun.	Matsatsi a 'maloa a fetileng a ne a le monate haholo.
He really doesn't care about me.	Ruri ha a na taba le nna.
He came in just right.	A kena hantle feela.
Learning quickly and working hard and forgetting the past.	Ho ithuta kapele le ho sebetsa ka thata le ho lebala tse fetileng.
To know more than that.	Ho tseba ho feta moo.
They want things.	Ba batla lintho.
They have nothing to do with us.	Ha ba na taba le rona.
Maybe a good idea.	Mohlomong mohopolo o motle.
Of course.	Ho hlakile.
He states the reason.	O bolela lebaka.
Now, you start talking, and talk fast.	Jwale, o qala ho bua, mme o bue kapele.
If anyone could provide any help it would be a surprise.	Haeba mang kapa mang a ka fana ka thuso efe kapa efe e ka ba ntho e makatsang.
We do not know what he did, or what he did not do.	Ha re tsebe seo a se entseng, kapa seo a sa kang a se etsa.
This is very early in the morning.	Sena ke hoseng haholo.
And there is no reason for him to think that anyone will do it.	'Me ha ho na lebaka la hore a nahane hore mang kapa mang o tla etsa joalo.
He asked her a absurd question.	O ile a mo botsa potso e se nang kelello.
In a few days.	Ka matsatsi a 'maloa.
So, look at it.	Ka hona, sheba ho eona.
We have nothing.	Ha re na letho.
Just have one.	E-ba le e 'ngoe feela.
Maybe he'll say his name.	Mohlomong o tla bolela lebitso la hae.
It was missing.	E ne e le sieo.
That's the way it is.	Ke mokhoa.
We did not know where we were going.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na re ee hokae.
It can be dangerous.	E ka ba kotsi.
Do not write anything like other people if you can help.	U se ke ua ngola letho joaloka batho ba bang haeba u ka thusa.
Here we learn to read only.	Mona re ithuta ho bala feela.
But they can't do anything '.	Empa ha ba khone ho etsa letho'.
Or to children.	Kapa ho bana.
Location from an important location.	Sebaka ho tloha sebakeng sa bohlokoa.
This would require money.	Sena se ne se tla hloka chelete.
The young man cried.	Mohlankana eo a lla.
One more time.	Nako e 'ngoe hape.
It doesn't have to be complicated.	Ha ho hlokahale hore e be thata haholo.
He would pay for it.	O ne a tla e lefa.
It took years to come to this conclusion.	Ho ile ha nka lilemo ho etsa qeto ena.
So that's not a question.	Kahoo seo ha se potso.
She is fine with me.	O hantle le nna.
The hard way but the fun.	Tsela e thata empa e monate.
I can't go on this way forever.	Ha ke khone ho tsoela pele ka tsela ena ho ea ho ile.
But that is just fine.	Empa hoo ke molemo feela.
I am nothing but a house.	Ha ke letho ntle le ntlo.
It is difficult to say so.	Ho thata ho bua joalo.
I need to talk to him.	Ke hloka ho bua le eena.
And many more.	Le tse ling tse ngata.
We love both of our children.	Re rata bana ba rōna ka bobeli.
You have nothing to do with me.	Ha le na taba le nna.
I just wanted to be myself.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba 'na feela.
It gives you an idea.	E o fa mohopolo.
To do nothing.	Ho se etse letho.
The baby keeps crying.	Ngoana o tsoela pele ho lla.
Well, let me tell you this.	Be, e re ke o bolelle taba ena.
Everything is there in his way of speaking.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e teng ka mokhoa oa hae oa ho bua.
She was beautiful.	O ne a le motle.
That's the way it is.	Ke mokhoa oo ho leng ka teng.
They know him well.	Ba mo tseba hantle.
Three hours ago.	Lihora tse tharo tse fetileng.
We've been talking to you.	Esale re bua le wena.
There is something important to do.	Ho na le ntho ea bohlokoa ho e etsa.
Maybe it's not that bad.	Mohlomong ke ntho e seng ntle hakaalo.
And he said, It is.	Mme a re ho jwalo.
We’re not talking about it, because it’s important.	Ha re bue ka eona, hobane e bohlokoa.
She rejected her husband's proposal.	O ile a hana tlhahiso ea monna oa hae.
The same is true of many people.	Ho bile joalo le ka batho ba bangata.
He will never come to my house again.	Ha a sa tla tla ha ka.
But just about that.	Empa hoo e ka bang feela.
I think we need that.	Ke nahana hore re hloka seo.
I'll be back there tomorrow morning.	Ke khutlela moo hosane hoseng.
I am very happy with my stay.	Ke thabile haholo ka ho lula ha ka.
He saw nothing he knew.	O ne a bona ho se letho leo a le tsebang.
Yet he swam.	Leha ho le joalo a sesa.
It should be so fun.	E lokela ho ba monate joalo.
It was really nice to watch.	E ne e le ntho e ntle ruri ho e shebella.
It's nice to know you.	Ho bile monate ho o tseba.
He could do with her what he wanted.	O ne a ka etsa ka eena seo a se ratang.
Unless they are.	Ntle le hore ha ba joalo.
We cannot live without water.	Re ke ke ra phela ntle le metsi.
But now, that's a real problem for you.	Empa joale, ke bothata ba sebele ho uena.
It did him no good.	Ha ea mo thusa letho.
Children learn to read and write.	Bana ba ithuta ho bala le ho ngola.
There was a rule for everything.	Ho ne ho e-na le molao bakeng sa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
It doesn't matter.	Ha a na taba.
Do not try to walk with a group.	Se ke oa leka ho tsamaea le sehlopha.
I do not want to sleep.	Ha ke batle ho robala.
This is one of those times.	Ena ke e 'ngoe ea linako tseo.
Your good stuff.	Lintho tsa hau tse ntle.
There was no opportunity to do so.	Ho ne ho se monyetla oa ho etsa joalo.
Please consider this before purchasing.	Ka kopo, nahana ka sena pele u reka.
No one knew what he did there alone.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba seo a se entseng moo a le mong.
It's just that simple.	E bonolo joalo feela.
Well, there it is.	Be, ke eo.
It was very early in the morning.	E ne e le hoseng haholo.
Which is definitely not true.	E leng hore ka sebele hase 'nete.
', or go to'.	', kapa u ee ho'.
I don't know what they think.	Ha ke tsebe seo ba se nahanang.
As with all his books, this is about people.	Joalo ka libuka tsohle tsa hae, sena se bua ka batho.
But children.	Empa bana.
I want to forget.	Ke batla ho lebala.
I know you know.	Kea tseba hore oa tseba.
Maybe it was a mistake.	Mohlomong e ne e le phoso.
It was just beautiful.	E ne e le ntle feela.
He is busy with important work.	O phathahane ka mosebetsi oa bohlokoa.
When something is so simple, people will use it.	Ha ntho e le bonolo hakaalo, batho ba tla e sebelisa.
Of course he was aware of the problems with this book.	Ehlile o ne a tseba ka mathata a buka ena.
And that was just last week.	Mme hoo e ne e le bekeng e fetileng feela.
The first room was empty.	Kamore ea pele e ne e se na letho.
Yes, that's a good question.	E, potso e ntle.
Nobody seems to want to do that.	Ho bonahala ho se motho ea batlang ho etsa joalo.
I have to find out what happened to me and why.	Ke tlameha ho fumana hore na ho etsahetse'ng ka 'na le hore na ke hobane'ng.
This way of life is no more.	Mokhoa ona oa bophelo ha o sa le eo.
I can't get in, without people seeing.	Ha ke khone ho kena, ntle le hore batho ba bone.
But neither do I.	Empa le 'na ha ke etse tsohle.
Here is the dog.	Ntja ke ena.
Things that used to look good now look bad.	Lintho tse neng li shebahala li le ntle joale li shebahala li le mpe.
It doesn't have to be a good thing.	Ha se hakaalo hore ke ntho e ntle.
But what you do is very important.	Empa seo u se etsang se bohlokoa haholo.
I'm not sure why.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore na hobaneng ho le joalo.
It is good for them.	Ho molemo ho bona.
They both love his life.	Bobeli ba rata bophelo ba hae.
When he refused, he knew it was not so.	Ha a hana joalo, o ne a tseba hore ha ho joalo.
They are better than that.	Ba betere ho feta moo.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ha ho letho leo u ka le etsang ka eona.
Night after night.	Bosiu ka mora bosiu.
And tell him why.	'Me u mo bolelle lebaka.
Very powerful.	Tse matla haholo.
I work hard for myself.	Ke sebetsa ka thata bakeng sa ka.
I didn't want it or anything.	Ha kea ka ka e batla kapa letho.
In the end, you can get something very good.	Qetellong, u ka fumana ntho e ntle haholo.
Everyone wants to play every day.	Motho e mong le e mong o batla ho bapala letsatsi le letsatsi.
This is what you wanted, isn't it?	Sena ke seo u neng u se batla, na ha ho joalo?
From what? 	Ho tsoa ho eng?
We get new clothes and eat food.	Re fumana liaparo tse ncha 'me re ja lijo.
I was not sure.	Ke ne ke se na bonnete.
Expect the same.	Lebella se tšoanang.
Yes, here was a place.	E, mona e ne e le sebaka.
It did not take.	Ha ea ka ea nka.
He says nothing to me.	Ha a re letho ho nna.
I mean it is, but it is not.	Ke bolela hore ho jwalo, empa ha ho jwalo.
Just one more thing.	Ntho e 'ngoe feela.
This made me and mine.	Sena se entse hore nna le ba ka.
The phone rang.	Mohala o ile oa lla.
Now, some more than others, of course.	Jwale, ba bang ho feta ba bang, ehlile.
It meant something to someone else.	E ne e bolela ho hong ho motho e mong.
Thanks for the help !.	Ke leboha thuso!.
I think it was very necessary.	Ke nahana hore e ne e hlokahala haholo.
He can play anything.	A ka bapala eng kapa eng.
That didn't matter.	Seo se ne se sa tsotelle letho.
Where he will start, remains to be seen.	Hore na o tla qala hokae, ho sa ntse ho tla bonahala.
We will help as much as we can.	Re tla thusa ka moo re ka khonang.
This thing will work, will it?	Ntho ena e tla sebetsa, na?
I'll tell you tomorrow.	Ke tla o bolella hosane.
But he does not have to.	Empa ha ho hlokahale hore a etse joalo.
There are a lot of people out there who like to help.	Ho na le batho ba bangata moo ba ratang ho thusa.
You may believe the same thing.	Le uena u ka ’na ua lumela ntho e tšoanang.
And we know it works.	'Me rea tseba hore ea sebetsa.
Of course it is.	Ho hlakile hore ho joalo.
But every great man did that.	Empa monna e mong le e mong e moholo o entse seo.
It helped them in some way.	E ile ea ba thusa ka tsela e itseng.
That's not bad.	Seo ha se mpe.
You did not know how long you would have to wait.	U ne u sa tsebe hore na u tla ema nako e kae.
I also do not like to think too much.	Le 'na ha ke rate ho nahana haholo.
He does not know what to do.	Ha a tsebe seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
It is very powerful.	E matla haholo.
It means how it is.	Ho bolela kamoo ho leng kateng.
I was able to move on.	Ke ne ke khona ho tsoela pele.
But it is relatively simple.	Empa e batla e le bonolo.
We never talked about money.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra bua ka chelete.
One would think that the same approach should apply to us.	Motho a ka nahana hore mokhoa o tšoanang o lokela ho sebetsa ho rōna.
Yes, that would work.	E, seo se ne se tla sebetsa.
But it is useless to talk to them.	Empa ha ho na thuso ho bua le bona.
It will no longer be enough.	Ho ke ke ha hlola ho lekana.
Hours passed.	Lihora li ile tsa feta.
They were not sure what had happened.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahetseng.
To them, the only danger is that they do.	Ho bona, kotsi feela ke hore ba etsa joalo.
Who has this money?	Ke mang ea nang le chelete ee?
No one knows why.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na ke hobane'ng.
It is very late now.	E se e le bosiu haholo.
He doesn't have it.	Ha a na eona.
Something was happening ahead.	Ho ne ho etsahala ntho e itseng ka pele.
I have to be there.	Ke tlameha ho ba teng.
I know how you know.	Kea tseba u tseba joang.
It has never been close to them.	Ha eso be haufi le bona.
But he knew he understood.	Empa o ne a tseba hore oa utloisisa.
You will too.	Le uena u tla etsa joalo.
Only they can do it.	Ke bona feela ba ka e etsang.
I can't be anywhere near here.	Ha ke khone ho ba kae kapa kae haufi le mona.
I continued to ride alone and outside.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele ho palama ke le mong le ka ntle.
But notice what happens next.	Empa hlokomela se etsahalang ka mor’a moo.
At times, they even approached the police.	Ka linako tse ling ba ne ba bile ba fihla le pele ho mapolesa.
It looks like a professional.	E shebahala e le setsebi.
That's his name.	Ke lebitso la hae.
You just don't think.	U mpa u sa nahane.
It is not close to repair.	Ha e haufi le ho lokisa.
The place here is very nice.	Sebaka sa mona se setle haholo.
Or it will find them.	Kapa e tla ba fumana.
Several did so.	Ba ’maloa ba ile ba etsa joalo.
The man thinks, carefully.	Monna o nahana, ka hloko.
I had to be strong.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho ba matla.
Besides, he wanted to watch fun.	Ntle ho moo, o ne a batla ho shebella monate.
Otherwise, say nothing.	Ho seng joalo, u se ke ua bua letho.
Of course, nothing.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho letho.
We need to get together.	Re hloka ho kopana hammoho.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho re feela, che.
You take a long way home.	U nka tsela e telele ho ea hae.
No one can.	Ha ho motho ea ka khonang.
It was nighttime.	Bona e ne e le bosiu.
I don't like them anymore.	Ha ke sa li rata.
That's what he does.	Ke seo a se etsang.
But otherwise, nothing.	Empa ho seng joalo, ha ho letho.
Again, they refused.	Hape, ba ile ba hana.
I like those things too.	Le 'na ke rata lintho tseo.
I would definitely go back to this place.	Ka sebele ke ne ke tla khutlela sebakeng sena.
Only, it is not.	Feela, ha ho joalo.
But it was not his place to say so.	Empa e ne e se sebaka sa hae ho bua joalo.
This is really easy.	Sena se hlile se bonolo.
His comments were always sweet.	Maikutlo a hae a ne a lula a le monate.
I still love him.	Ke ntse ke mo rata.
They do not tell us anything.	Ha ba re bolelle letho.
Who did he want.	O ne a batla mang.
However, this is not the case here.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se joalo mona.
At the same time, amazing things happened.	Ka nako e tšoanang, ho ile ha etsahala lintho tse makatsang.
That child is a masterpiece.	Ngoana eo ke setsebi se hloahloa.
I'm sorry.	Ke masoabi.
You would not have known about the problem without the danger.	O ka be o sa tseba ka bothata ntle le kotsi.
I tell you how.	Ke u bolella kamoo.
I like the people here.	Ke rata batho ba mona.
However, I did not see him.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke sa mo bone.
I know he was probably happy.	Kea tseba hore mohlomong o ne a thabile.
Sometimes he could not come back on time for dinner.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a sitoa ho khutla ka nako bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
At the time we seemed to be united.	Ka nako eo re ne re bonahala re kopane.
But you should not stay if you do not want to.	Empa ha ua lokela ho lula haeba u sa batle.
He often told me a lot.	Hangata o ne a mpolella haholo.
But do not start drinking.	Empa u se ke ua qala ho noa.
Probably not knowing how important it was.	Mohlomong ho se tsebe hore na e ne e le ea bohlokoa hakae.
As he would do.	Joalo ka ha a ne a tla etsa.
I think you will know that.	Ke nahana hore o tla tseba seo.
It worked, for several days.	E ile ea sebetsa, ka matsatsi a 'maloa.
You will know it.	O tla e tseba.
Maybe just drinking or whatever.	Mohlomong ho noa feela kapa eng.
That's the way it should be.	Ke kamoo e lokelang ho ba kateng.
He would hear the man.	O ne a tla utloa monna eo.
Before you eat, thank you.	Pele u ja, leboha.
I too forget a lot.	Le nna ke lebala haholo.
He knew it was a long time.	O ne a tseba hore ke nako e telele.
We need to recognize that.	Re lokela ho hlokomela seo.
How he loved her.	Kamoo a neng a mo rata kateng.
I always try to forget it.	Kamehla ke leka ho e lebala.
Many people wondered about that.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba ipotsa ka taba eo.
Get life !!!!!!!!!!!!.	Fumana bophelo!!!!!!!!!!!!.
He was just trying to help.	O ne a mpa a leka ho thusa.
But sometimes it does.	Empa ka linako tse ling hoa etsahala.
A real book.	Buka ea sebele.
There was no time we had to do it.	Ha ho nako eo re neng re tlameha ho e etsa.
Yet this was true.	Leha ho le joalo sena e ne e le 'nete.
Look at the children carefully.	Sheba bana ka hloko.
I heard something strange.	Ke ile ka utloa ntho e makatsang.
It's just a way of thinking about it.	Ke mokhoa feela oa ho e nahana.
That's the only way.	Ke eona feela tsela.
A lot of people come in.	Batho ba bangata ba kena.
None of us said anything.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea ileng a bua letho.
But the opportunity is still beyond me.	Empa monyetla o ntse o le ka ntle ho 'na.
He was tough as they came.	O ne a le thata ha ba ntse ba tla.
It just didn't do that.	Feela ha ea ka ea etsa joalo.
I should not have expected him to know this.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho lebella hore o tla tseba sena.
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le joalo.
But it works for both.	Empa e sebetsa ka bobeli.
The only way to write is to write.	Tsela feela ea ho ngola ke ho ngola.
Certainly not money.	Ka sebele ha se chelete.
My feelings will hurt.	Maikutlo a ka a tla utloa bohloko.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
He wanted to be at the end.	O ne a batla ho ba qetellong.
But it worked.	Empa e ile ea sebetsa.
It does what it wants to do.	E etsa seo e batlang ho se etsa.
Of course, he could not get into many of them.	Ka sebele, o ne a sa khone ho kena ho tse ngata tsa tsona.
The food is very good.	Lijo li ntle haholo.
Let go of indifference.	Ho tlohela ho se tsotelle.
I live alone.	Ke lula ke le mong.
Bedroom.	Kamore ea kamore.
It really works well.	E hlile e sebetsa hantle.
It was an exciting time.	Nako eo e ne e le monate.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	E ka ’na eaba ke lona lebaka le entseng hore ho se ke ha etsahala letho.
She is a big girl.	Ke ngoanana e moholo.
And yet you want to know.	Mme leha ho le jwalo o batla ho tseba.
It had just passed, by the way.	E neng e sa tsoa feta, ka tsela.
Which is strange.	E leng ntho e makatsang.
See it my way.	E bone ka tsela ea ka.
Many people did.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba etsa joalo.
I think it should be something like that.	Ke nahana hore e lokela ho ba ntho e joalo.
I have to go.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
He keeps his innocence.	O boloka ho hloka molato ha hae.
Of course, this is true.	Ha e le hantle, sena ke ’nete.
But it is still good.	Empa e ntse e le molemo.
Our team finished first.	Sehlopha sa rona se qetile pele.
He really needed help.	O ne a hloka thuso haholo.
This has never happened before.	Sena ha se e-so ka se etsahala pele.
They all seemed to have no arms and legs.	Bohle ba ne ba bonahala ba se na matsoho le maoto.
It is not a good place to be.	Ha se sebaka se setle sa ho ba teng.
Maybe even a place.	Mohlomong le sebaka.
I would have to earn some money.	Ke ne ke tla tlameha ho fumana chelete.
However, the problem is power.	Leha ho le joalo, bothata ke matla.
But you were there.	Empa u ne u le teng.
Perhaps he expected her to do the same.	Mohlomong o ne a lebeletse hore le eena a etse se tšoanang.
One cannot do without the other.	E mong a ke ke a etsa ntle le e mong.
You continue in any way you can.	U tsoela pele ka tsela efe kapa efe eo u ka e khonang.
That will only do so.	Seo se tla etsa joalo feela.
He opened his door.	A bula lemati la hae.
In fact, it could happen for a long time.	Ha e le hantle, e ka etsahala ka nako e telele.
You can come back and tell her, but don’t stop.	U ka ’na ua khutla ’me ua mo bolella, empa u se ke ua ema.
Speaking.	Ho bua.
I just wanted to see what happened to them.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho bona hore na ho etsahetse’ng ka bona.
He just made a mistake.	O entse phoso feela.
Both parents worked long hours.	Batsoali ka bobeli ba ne ba sebetsa lihora tse telele.
I would have loved it.	Nka be ke ile ka rata.
He did nothing more.	Ha aa ka a etsa letho hape.
The more one knows about me, the better.	Ha motho a ntse a tseba hanyane ka nna, ho molemo ho feta.
But he could do this.	Empa o ne a ka etsa sena.
We do not like the idea.	Ha re rate mohopolo oo.
He knows this place very well.	O tseba sebaka sena hantle.
They spoke.	Ba ne ba bua.
We need to make it possible.	Re hloka ho etsa hore monyetla o be teng.
So he had to go home again.	Kahoo o ile a tlameha ho tsamaea ho ea hae hape.
They will come.	Ba tla tla.
They give him their last water.	Ba mo fa metsi a bona a ho qetela.
Keep doing this.	Tsoela pele ho etsa sena.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
Best to stand.	Molemo ka ho fetisisa ho ema.
I'm right about that.	Ke hantle ka seo.
There is really nothing I can do.	Ruri ha ho letho leo nka le etsang.
I wanted to be better than that.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba betere ho feta moo.
So she started to cry.	Kahoo a qala ho lla.
I know, too.	Ke a tseba, le nna.
In this way.	Ka mokhoa ona.
I have been there but you can find them for real.	Ke bile teng empa u ka li fumana ka 'nete.
Perhaps you do too.	Mohlomong le uena u etsa joalo.
It is better not to think about that.	Ho molemo ho se nahane ka seo.
I do not like this.	Ha ke rate sena.
I still don't care.	Ke ntse ke sa tsotelle.
If anyone can, it's you.	Haeba mang kapa mang a khona, ke uena.
The second is the issue of power.	Ea bobeli ke taba ea matla.
In this place, we too can find our place.	Sebakeng sena, le rona re ka fumana sebaka sa rona.
I just wanted to pay and get out of there.	Ke ne ke batla ho lefa feela ebe ke tsoa moo.
They would be.	Ba ne ba tla ba joalo.
Their money is good.	Chelete ea bona e ntle.
By anyone.	Ka motho ofe kapa ofe.
However, it is not my business.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se taba ea ka.
I was behind him.	Ke ne ke le ka mora hae.
It was just what you needed at the time.	E ne e le seo o neng o se hloka ka nako eo.
They were exactly the same size.	Ba ne ba lekana hantle.
I have my own car.	Ke na le koloi ea ka.
He had told her many things.	O ne a mo boleletse lintho tse ngata.
Water in the back.	Metsi ka morao.
He had to do what he had to do.	O ne a lokela ho etsa seo a neng a lokela ho se etsa.
So all will go well.	Kahoo tsohle li tla tsamaea hantle.
He would have been very sad.	A ka be a ile a utloa bohloko haholo.
I would not have asked for more.	Nka be ke sa kopa ho feta.
It's a beautiful place.	Ke sebaka se setle.
Of course it will be in danger.	Ehlile e tla ba kotsing.
He knew the name, but he did not know why.	Lebitso leo o ne a le tseba, empa o ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
They know what happened.	Ba tseba se etsahetseng.
With this decision, he started a great process.	Ka qeto ena, o ile a qala mokhoa o moholo.
He took some of them.	O ile a nka tse ling tsa tsona.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
Here we find our feet and our strength.	Mona re fumana maoto le matla a rona.
His son is.	Mora oa hae ke.
It was easy to love.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho rata.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
Maybe we do, maybe we don't.	Mohlomong re etsa joalo, mohlomong ha re etse joalo.
He loved it so much.	O ne a e rata haholo.
This makes them money.	Sena se ba etsa chelete.
Thank you for taking advantage of me.	Kea u leboha ka ho nka monyetla ka nna.
Probably some of both.	Mohlomong tse ling tsa tsona ka bobeli.
As for next week.	Joalo ka bekeng e tlang.
As he ate, he began to think.	Ha a ntse a ja, a qala ho nahana.
I found.	Ke fumane.
That came and went.	Seo se ile sa tla mme sa feta.
It's a thing.	Ke ntho.
Sorry for writing so much.	Ke masoabi ka ho ngola haholo.
She is doing what she loves right now.	O etsa seo a se ratang hona joale.
Where are we going?	Re ea kae.
Never forget about it.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua lebala ka eona.
You just ask for trouble when you do that !.	U mpa u kopa mathata ha u etsa joalo!.
We must always talk about it.	Re tlameha ho lula re bua ka eona.
Bad, very bad.	E mpe, e mpe haholo.
Just as powerful.	E matla joalo feela.
Want to know my opinion?	Na u batla ho tseba maikutlo a ka?
He needed me to be there for him.	O ne a hloka hore ke be teng bakeng sa hae.
But not so with you.	Empa ha ho joalo ka uena.
That's what it's supposed to be.	Ke seo e lokelang ho ba sona.
When he moves a little to the chance to get better.	Ha a tloha hanyane ho ea ho monyetla oa ho ba betere.
No one needs it anymore.	Ha ho motho ea e hlokang hape.
I do not want her to know about this.	Ha ke batle hore a tsebe ka sena.
He wanted to go.	O ne a batla ho tsamaea.
It's, well, learning.	Ho, hantle, ho ithuta.
Now here are some of them.	Jwale ke ba bang ba bona.
Now stop crying.	Jwale tlohela ho lla.
I don't see him using it.	Ha ke bone a e sebelisa.
We start small.	Re qala hanyane.
We had such a wonderful time.	Re bile le nako e monate hakana.
He did not know.	O ne a eso tsebe.
Do you see that dog?	O bona ntja eo?
It's really pretty.	E hlile e ntle haholo.
No, no, we did not hear.	Che, che, ha rea ​​ka ra utloa.
That is a problem.	Ntho eo ke bothata.
It is not just a thought.	Hase mohopolo feela.
We only work at night.	Re sebetsa bosiu feela.
He knew nothing.	O ne a sa tsebe letho.
It would make life very difficult.	Ho ne ho tla etsa hore bophelo bo be thata haholoanyane.
There can be too many of them.	Ho ka ba le tse ngata haholo tsa tsona.
And you can't tell how long it will take.	Hape u ke ke ua bolela hore na li tla nka nako e kae.
He did not like her.	O ne a sa mo rate.
She is fine.	O hantle.
I forget things.	Ke lebala lintho.
I have a lot of questions.	Ke na le lipotso tse ngata.
He did not expect any further.	O ne a sa lebella ho hang ho ya pele.
No one understood.	Ha ho motho ea neng a utloisisa.
The question is why.	Potso ke hore na hobaneng ho ka ba joalo.
I was making things very difficult.	Ke ne ke etsa hore lintho li be thata haholo.
Yet he knew he would take her again.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a tseba hore o tla mo nka hape.
We'll have to talk about it another time.	Re tla tlameha ho bua ka nako e 'ngoe.
I can't stand it !!.	Ha ke khone ho ema !!.
I mean,.	Ke bolela,.
You will know soon.	O tla tseba haufinyane.
Take it for granted.	E nke e se ea bohlokoa.
So something happens.	Kahoo ho na le ntho e etsahalang.
We do not do this simply because we think it is a good idea.	Ha re etse sena feela hobane re nahana hore ke mohopolo o motle.
The man has to move on.	Monna o tlameha ho tsoela pele ka lintho.
She was the only girl with him.	E ne e le ngoanana feela ea nang le eena.
He decided to do both.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho e etsa ka bobeli.
But he does.	Empa oa etsa joalo.
The young man bought coffee.	Mohlankana eo o ile a reka kofi.
There was nothing he could do.	Ho ne ho se seo a ka se etsang.
But that was not the case.	Empa e ne e se mohopolo oo.
But open your mind a little bit.	Empa bula kelello ea hau hanyane.
But he knew he had to do something.	Empa o ne a tseba hore o tlameha ho etsa ho hong.
He wanted to forget.	O ne a batla ho lebala.
Go with it.	Tsamaea le eona.
You are real.	Wena wa sebele.
I know the way out well.	Ke tseba tsela ea ho tsoa hantle.
That was none of my business.	Eo e ne e se taba ea ka.
Everyone needs feedback.	E mong le e mong o hloka maikutlo.
I like their style.	Ke rata mokhoa oa bona.
I've certainly seen that.	Ruri ke bone seo.
I'm sorry, man.	Ke masoabi, monna.
It was very simple.	E ne e le bonolo haholo.
I feel happy too.	Le 'na ke ikutloa ke thabile.
I wanted to make sure it fit you first.	Ke ne ke batla ho etsa bonnete ba hore e u lekana pele.
I hope some of these books will do that for you.	Ke tšepa hore tse ling tsa libuka tsena li tla u etsetsa seo.
No one could make me do them.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka etsa hore ke li etse.
It is for him.	Ke bakeng sa hae.
It could be just one person.	Ho ne ho ka ba motho a le mong feela.
It is useless to do so.	Ha ho na thuso ho etsa joalo.
He did not know why, but it was too late.	O ne a sa tsebe lebaka, empa e ne e se e le morao haholo.
he says.	o re.
Or he may not get over it.	Kapa a ka 'na a se na ho feta.
Yet he did nothing for us.	Leha ho le joalo ha aa ka a re etsetsa letho.
Let your feet decide.	Lumella maoto a hao ho etsa qeto.
It doesn't matter to them anymore.	Ha e sa na taba ho bona.
Think about your own situation.	Nahana ka boemo ba hau.
Such a problem has happened before.	Bothata bo joalo bo kile ba etsahala pele.
Do not do it if you do not like it.	U se ke ua e etsa haeba u sa e rate.
There should be many like them.	Ho lokela hore ho be le ba bangata ba tšoanang le bona.
They think you will never know.	Ba nahana hore u ke ke ua tseba.
His head was clearer than now.	Hlooho ya hae e ne e hlakile ho feta jwale.
I grabbed it.	Ke ile ka e tšoara.
Yes, we could.	E, re ne re ka khona.
All of you.	Kaofela ha hao.
He was out of place.	O ne a se sebakeng.
He does not go for simplicity.	Ha a ee bakeng sa bonolo.
That is not a place of any kind for people like us.	Seo ha se sebaka sa mofuta ofe kapa ofe bakeng sa batho ba kang rona.
He must have loved her.	E tlameha ebe o ne a mo rata.
He seemed to be talking to himself.	O ne a bonahala a bua a le mong.
But that was not the way we wanted to go.	Empa eo e ne e se tsela eo re neng re batla ho ea ka eona.
It is not always a good thing.	Ha se kamehla ntho e ntle.
That is, as long as you are here for that.	Ke hore, ha feela o le teng mona bakeng sa seo.
Three years, you decide after reading.	Lilemo tse tharo, u etsa qeto ka mor'a ho bala.
They do not know how this can happen.	Ha ba tsebe hore na sena se ka etsahala joang.
Everyone knew who he was.	Bohle ba ne ba tseba hore na ke mang.
There is no child.	Ha ho na ngoana.
He looked at his phone.	A sheba mohala oa hae.
I was just starting to use them.	Ke ne ke qala ho li sebelisa.
They heard it before they understood it.	Ba ne ba li utloa pele ba li utloisisa.
Instead, they try to find something new and new.	Ho e-na le hoo, ba leka ho fumana tse ncha le tse ncha.
It's almost too long.	E batla e le telele.
He tries it.	O a o leka.
I would love to watch them with you.	Ke ne ke tla rata ho li sheba le uena.
Then he left.	Eaba oa tsamaea.
They never asked her if she wanted it.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba mo botsa hore na oa e batla.
She thought that if she spoke, she would start to cry.	O ne a nahana hore ha a ka bua o tla qala ho lla.
So this is something new.	Kahoo sena ke ntho e ncha.
Many people do.	Batho ba bangata ba etsa joalo.
It may not have been the first.	E ka 'na eaba e ne e se oa pele.
Everyone should do that.	E mong le e mong o lokela ho etsa seo.
I've been home all week.	Ke bile hae beke kaofela.
It certainly did.	Ka sebele e entse joalo.
We realize that.	Re hlokomela seo.
Some have done it.	Ba bang ba e entse.
No one has ever seen the idea.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a bona mohopolo.
He declined to give his name.	O ile a hana ho fana ka lebitso la hae.
It became even more difficult to find water.	Ho ile ha e-ba thata le ho feta ho fumana metsi.
I understand your stuff first and you are very good.	Ke utloisisa lintho tsa hau pele mme o hantle haholo.
That's the main thing here.	Ke eona ntho ea bohlokoa mona.
We want it to be that fast and easy.	Re batla hore e be kapele le ha bonolo joalo.
He had just been injured.	O ne a sa tsoa kotsi.
But not all the news is bad.	Empa litaba ha li mpe kaofela.
No singing.	Ha ho bina.
Water was his life.	Metsi e ne e le bophelo ba hae.
She knew she was beautiful but she loved books more than people.	O ne a tseba hore o motle empa a rata libuka ho feta batho.
They began to meet.	Ba ile ba qala ho kopana.
How does this work?	Hoo ho sebetsa joang?
He turned to his friends for help.	O ile a kōpa thuso ho metsoalle ea hae.
He would be able to.	O ne a tla khona.
This is definitely my opinion.	Ehlile ena ke maikutlo a ka.
Only you.	Ke uena feela.
Some ideas were even worse.	Maikutlo a mang a ne a le mpe le ho feta.
I need to tell you everything.	Ke hloka ho o bolella tsohle.
A wonderful inheritance for any man.	Lefa le makatsang bakeng sa monna ofe kapa ofe.
You will never want it again.	U ke ke ua hlola u e batla.
I stopped when he came in.	Ke ile ka ema ha a kena.
It hurts a lot.	Ho bohloko haholo.
But that's you.	Empa ke wena eo.
We will talk to it.	Re tla bua le eona.
I mean you look tough when you're wearing it.	Ke bolela hore o shebahala o le thata ha o apere.
Yet that is how we felt.	Leha ho le joalo ke kamoo re neng re ikutloa kateng.
This is very important to us.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa haholo ho rona.
I'd like to see both of them again.	Ke kopa ho bona bobeli ba bona hape.
I will be behind you.	Ke tla ba ka mora hao.
It really happened.	E ne e hlile e etsahala.
He still has to be no.	O ntse a lokela ho ba che.
In fact, they are unable to walk on their hind legs.	Ha e le hantle ha li khone ho tsamaea ka maoto a ka morao.
Moreover, he did not go on.	Ho feta moo, ha a tsoela pele.
She reads books.	O bala libuka.
We knew it was the last time we were together.	Re ne re tseba hore e ne e le lekhetlo la ho qetela re le hammoho.
He does a good job here.	O etsa mosebetsi o motle mona.
He quickly puts on his clothes.	O apara liaparo tsa hae kapele.
We cannot do it alone.	Re ke ke ra e etsa re le bang.
I am very happy with it.	Ke thabile haholo ka eona.
No, we certainly do not.	Che, ka sebele ha re etse joalo.
For the Father before me, even me now.	Bakeng sa Ntate pele ho 'na, le' na hona joale.
But this is not the case.	Empa sena ha se joalo.
But even without that.	Empa le ntle le seo.
Looks like it won't be soon.	Ho bonahala eka e ke ke ea e-ba haufinyane.
But it would be important.	Empa e ne e tla ba ea bohlokoa.
I'm sorry about this.	Ke masoabi ka sena.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
But that was not enough.	Empa hoo ho ne ho sa lekana.
And he will do it.	Mme o tla e etsa.
She never told me about it.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a mpolella ka taba ena.
I am three years old.	Ke lilemo li tharo.
There is certainly something better than nothing.	Ka sebele ho na le ntho e molemo ho feta letho.
I can do this without my father.	Nka etsa sena ntle le ntate oa ka.
Do not stop walking.	U se ke ua tlohela ho tsamaea.
You are the people.	Ke lona batho.
Do you have any objections?	A na u na le lintho tse itseng tsa ho hana?
It seemed like an important idea.	E ne eka ke mohopolo oa bohlokoa.
Delivery date.	Letsatsi la ho fana ka lona.
Like a Mother.	Joalo ka 'Mè.
Type of car, however.	Mofuta oa koloi, leha ho le joalo.
His second question.	Potso ea hae ea bobeli.
People know this place.	Batho ba tseba sebaka sena.
That is what they want us to do.	Ke seo ba batlang hore re se etse.
And you know why.	'Me ua tseba lebaka.
Even if that person is me.	Leha motho eo ke nna.
They said nothing to anyone but me.	Ha baa ka ba bua letho ho mang kapa mang ntle le 'na.
He was a strong man, it seems.	E ne e le monna ea matla, ho ka bonahala.
I did it once and I did it again.	Ke e entse hang mme hape ke entse.
But it was a week before that.	Empa e ne e le beke pele ho moo.
I would do it for my child.	Ke ne ke tla e etsetsa ngoana oa ka.
It is happening now.	Hoa etsahala hona joale.
We have not had enough of it.	Ha re e-so be le eona e lekaneng.
They will need you.	Ba tla u hloka.
He had seen it and won.	O ne a e bone mme a hlola.
Keep yours	Boloka ea hau
He wants to eat.	O batla ho ja.
Don't talk to me.	Se bue le nna.
I talk to him a lot.	Ke bua le eena haholo.
But now the time has come.	Empa joale nako ea fihla.
We have all been where you are.	Kaofela re bile moo o leng teng.
He said he was.	O ile a re ke eena.
I needed help.	Ke ne ke hloka thuso.
I want that now.	Ke batla seo ha jwale.
I rode.	Ke ile ka palama.
There is no way to know.	Haho mokhoa oa ho tseba.
It can go, it can be very late.	E ka tsamaea, e ka ba morao haholo.
And it left there.	Mme ya tloha moo.
The book did not exist before.	Buka eo e ne e le sieo pele.
I usually work.	Hangata kea sebetsa.
They were looking for a place.	Ba ne ba batla sebaka.
But it is clear.	Empa ho hlakile.
Some people do not want to do it.	Batho ba bang ha ba batle ho e etsa.
He is giving it away.	O ntse a fana ka eona.
She is very sweet.	O monate haholo.
She does well, because she is a girl.	O etsa hantle, hobane ke ngoanana.
He enjoyed eating them alive.	O ne a thabela ho li ja li phela.
Of course, that did not happen here.	Ho hlakile hore seo ha sea etsahala mona.
It was clearly not what he expected to say.	Ho hlakile hore e ne e se seo a neng a lebeletse hore a se bue.
I want nothing to do with him.	Ha ke batle letho ho etsa letho ka eena.
Probably very new.	Mohlomong e ncha haholo.
He ate nothing.	Ha ea ka ea ja letho.
I can't stop this.	Ha ke khone ho tlohela sena.
From one to the other.	Ho tloha ho e 'ngoe ho ea ho e' ngoe.
Now, we're done.	Jwale, re se re qetile.
There are problems, yes.	Ho na le mathata, e.
Do not speak while eating.	O se ke wa bua ha o ja.
You can't do that with children.	U ke ke ua etsa joalo le bana.
Sometimes they are not.	Ka nako e 'ngoe ha ba joalo.
He said he needed time to sort things out.	A re o hloka nako ea ho lokisa taba.
I took it.	Ke e nkile.
It's coming home.	Ke ho tla hae.
He says yes.	O re ho joalo.
We will not be long.	Re ke ke ra ba nako e telele.
I will not use anything else.	Ha ke sa tla sebelisa letho le leng.
For her, and for me.	Bakeng sa hae, le bakeng sa ka.
Work on some of them.	Sebetsa tse ling tsa tsona.
Then let it go.	Ebe u e tlohela.
Here are some suggestions on how to use it.	Mona leka tsena.
Plenty of coffee, whether you want it or not.	Kofi e ngata, hore na ua e batla kapa che.
But in a real way.	Empa ka tsela ea sebele.
It even has a door.	E bile e na le lemati.
This is difficult.	Sena se thata.
I'm going too fast '.	Ke tsamaea kapele haholo'.
Then why not.	Joale hobaneng ho se joalo.
I can only ask.	Nka botsa feela.
All for his family.	Tsohle bakeng sa lelapa la hae .
We made a quick decision.	Re ile ra etsa qeto kapele.
They certainly do.	Ka sebele ba etsa joalo.
We will be back with you soon.	Re tla khutla le uena haufinyane.
It's not very easy.	Ha ho bonolo haholo.
Of course, that did not happen.	Ha e le hantle, ha hoa ka ha e-ba joalo.
Some people do it often.	Batho ba bang ba e etsa hangata.
And this, it seems, is a problem.	'Me sena, ho bonahala, ke bothata.
So he called to ask.	Kahoo a letsa ho botsa.
This is normal.	Sena ke sa kamehla.
Exactly the same.	E tšoanang hantle.
This place has a place for.	Sebaka sena se na le sebaka sa.
He cares for you.	Oa o hlokomela.
Of course he was still more beautiful than before.	Ehlile o ne a ntse a le motle ho feta pele.
There is help there, of course !!.	Ho na le thuso moo, ka 'nete !!.
I saw him come back to you.	Ke ile ka mo bona ha a khutlela ho uena.
But the news is good.	Empa litaba li ntle.
Yes, he thought he had.	E, o ne a nahana hore o entse joalo.
It seemed like a long time.	E ne eka ke nako e telele.
Here you go.	Ke tsena.
And it was their first !.	'Me e ne e le ea bona ea pele!.
More than enough.	Ho feta ho lekaneng.
There has been something before that.	Ho bile le ntho e itseng pele ho moo.
They came back with good news.	Ba ile ba khutla le litaba tse monate.
Many felt the same way.	Ba bangata ba ile ba ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
But if he had lived somewhere else he would have thought he was not living.	Empa ha a ka dula sebakeng se seng o ne a tla nahana hore ha a dula.
And maybe that’s the point.	'Me mohlomong ke eona taba.
People needed pain.	Batho ba ne ba hloka bohloko.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
We need some help.	Re kopa thuso e 'ngoe.
I say too long.	Ke re nako e telele haholo.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
She tried to take someone else to take her children.	O ile a leka ho nka motho e mong a nka bana ba hae.
I will give you anything.	Ke tla u fa eng kapa eng.
It had a certain kind.	E bile le mofuta o itseng.
He loves it in any way.	O e rata ka tsela efe kapa efe.
They want to see what will happen.	Ba batla ho bona se tla etsahala.
I do not know how to do this.	Ha ke tsebe hore na nka etsa sena joang.
Night dog.	Ntja bosiu bosiu.
Everything is so beautiful.	Tsohle li ntle haholo.
And you will need it.	'Me u tla e hloka.
No, you should not.	Che, ha ua lokela.
Just meet them.	O mpe o kopane le bona.
It really is not a difficult process.	Ha e le hantle hase mokhoa o thata.
He is with me.	O na le nna.
But perhaps that is not the case.	Empa mohlomong ha ho joalo.
Leave without looking at anyone.	Tloha ntle le ho sheba mang kapa mang.
Today, you are the only one.	Kajeno, ke uena feela.
I used to go and live there.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ho ea lula moo.
I just don't like that tonight.	Ke mpa ke sa rate seo bosiung bona.
I did it anyway.	Ke e entse leha ho le joalo.
He has it.	O na le eona.
But there is one thing that can be important.	Empa ho na le ntho e le 'ngoe e ka bang bohlokoa.
I took it that way.	Ke e nkile joalo.
Surprisingly, it is incredibly beautiful.	Ka mokhoa o makatsang, o motle ka mokhoa o makatsang.
They are very close now.	Ba se ba le haufi haholo hona joale.
You have to eat something.	O lokela ho ja ho hong.
I couldn’t do what they do.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho etsa seo ba se etsang.
If you love someone, tell them.	Haeba u rata motho, mo bolelle.
I want to be the best.	Ke batla ho ba ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He had a problem understanding that question.	O ne a na le bothata ba ho utloisisa potso eo.
And so this is for you.	'Me kahoo sena ke sa hau.
Don't you see that is useless?	Na ha o bone seo ha se na thuso?
It must be this place!	E tlameha ebe ke sebaka sena!
I had no idea about that.	Ke ne ke sa nahana ka seo.
I think he is.	Ke nahana hore o.
I usually buy in one batch.	Hangata ke reka ka sehlopha se le seng.
Sorry a little.	Ka masoabi hanyane.
Be the best you can be.	Eba se molemo ka ho fetisisa seo u ka bang sona.
Now the house is gone.	Hona joale ntlo ha e sa le eo.
I'll take it from there.	Ke tla e nka ho tloha moo.
He is superior to us all.	O re feta bohle.
We can hope he doesn't think it's us.	Re ka tšepa hore ha a nahane hore ke rona.
However, I am not sure where to go from there.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hantle hore na u ka ea kae ho tloha moo.
Obviously not here.	Ho hlakile hore ha ho joalo mona.
I had no idea about that.	Ke ne ke sa nahana ka seo.
Probably the first one.	Mohlomong ea pele.
You don't seem to have anything.	Ha ho bonahale u na le letho.
Lol!.	Ha ha ha!.
They don't like that.	Ha ba rate seo.
He had never been there.	O ne a eso be teng.
I think it got him.	Ke nahana hore e mo fumane.
He was my father.	E ne e le ntate oa ka.
It made me late for a few days, though.	E entse hore ke be morao ka matsatsi a 'maloa, leha ho le joalo.
So far this works well.	Ho fihlela joale sena se sebetsa hantle.
He just knew without knowing why he knew.	O ne a tseba feela a sa tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a tseba.
He needed to be alone.	O ne a hloka ho ba mong.
She tried to think of him now.	A leka ho mo nahana jwale.
You have to see it to believe it !.	U tlameha ho e bona ho e lumela!.
They didn't have to work, but they worked.	Ba ne ba sa lokela ho sebetsa, empa ba ile ba sebetsa.
You can use it to hold whatever you need.	U ka e sebelisa ho tšoara eng kapa eng eo u e hlokang.
I mean, sometimes.	Ke bolela, ka nako e 'ngoe.
These people are important.	Batho bana ba bohlokoa.
I need to go, and you have to go too.	Ke hloka ho tsamaea, le uena u lokela ho tsamaea.
Here, one should not try to think, one must feel.	Mona, motho ha a lokela ho leka ho nahana, o tlameha ho ikutloa.
They have a real chance of reaching the final.	Ba na le monyetla oa sebele oa ho fihla ho qetela.
We thought we were doing what we were supposed to do.	Re ne re nahana hore re etsa seo re neng re lokela ho se etsa.
Someone was crying.	Motho o ne a lla.
I just wanted to help the team win.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho thusa sehlopha ho hlola.
You will probably love him even more.	Mohlomong o tla mo rata le ho feta.
Then they both began to cry.	Eaba ka bobeli ba qala ho lla.
But they obviously knew you were driving my car.	Empa ho hlakile hore baa tseba hore u ne u khanna koloi ea ka.
And your husband.	Le monna oa hao.
I can't get back to this.	Ha ke khone ho khutla ho sena.
It's just that it's his.	Ke feela hore ke hae.
Those who need it will not find it.	Ba e hlokang ba ke ke ba e fumana.
You could see what he did to her.	O ne o ka bona seo e mo entseng sona.
You give a good thing to a man.	U fana ka ntho e ntle ho monna.
Do not drink it.	U se ke ua e noa.
It should be fun.	E lokela ho ba monate.
If we can give, we should give.	Haeba re khona ho fana, re lokela ho fana.
It can be very nice.	E ka ba ntle haholo.
Or it has.	Kapa e kile ea etsa joalo.
Don't tell me.	O seke wa mpolella.
Now you know my condition.	Joale u tseba boemo ba ka.
Otherwise, it may not say so.	Ntle ho moo, e ka 'na ea se ke ea bolela joalo.
It's his car.	Ke koloi ea hae.
It does this.	E etsa sena.
That is even more dangerous.	Seo se kotsi ho feta.
Still, we love him.	Leha ho le joalo, rea mo rata.
Yes to that.	Ee ho seo.
But there are problems.	Empa ho na le mathata.
And he was alone.	Mme o ne a le mong.
I could not just hear that.	Ke ne nke ke ka utloa seo feela.
They have never done that before, and they never will.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba etsa joalo, 'me ha ho mohla ba tla etsa joalo.
It does the same thing.	Le eona e etsa ntho e tšoanang.
He looked at the girl.	A sheba ngoanana eo.
They make a mistake.	Ba nka phoso.
As if there is nothing you can talk about.	Joalo ka ha ho letho leo u ka buang ka lona.
He did not seem to be eating at all.	O ne a bonahala a sa je ho hang.
There had to be a way out.	Ho ne ho tlameha ho ba le tsela ea ho tsoa.
He spoke softly.	A bua ka bonolo.
Now you have my opinion.	Joale u na le maikutlo a ka.
I am not human and everyone.	Ha ke motho le bohle.
I want my children.	Ke batla bana ba ka.
I finally saw my father.	Qetellong ke ile ka bona Ntate.
It works very well.	E sebetsa hantle haholo.
I try not to care.	Ke leka ho se tsotelle.
To be or not to be, that is the question.	Ho ba kapa ho se be, ke potso eo.
It can be a painful life.	E ka ba bophelo bo bohloko.
I see you.	Kea u bona.
I heard.	Ke ile ka utloa.
It was painful.	E ne e le bohloko.
If you can think of it they can do it.	Haeba u ka e nahana ba ka e etsa.
It was for just one dinner.	E ne e le bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea tse le 'ngoe feela.
But we cannot continue this way.	Empa re ke ke ra tsoela pele ka tsela ena.
It is possible to take a car.	Ho ka etsahala ho nka koloi.
To us, it was a strange thing.	Ho rona, e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
But he says he sees no reason to continue living.	Empa o re ha a bone lebaka la ho tsoela pele a phela.
But they did well in what they did.	Empa ba ne ba sebetsa hantle ho seo ba se etsang.
Good sense.	Kelello e ntle.
My mother opened the front door.	'Mè o ile a bula lemati le ka pele.
No one really knew what was going on.	Ha ho motho ea neng a hlile a tseba se etsahalang.
Now is the time to live and do good things.	Joale ke nako ea ho phela le ho etsa lintho tse monate.
Yes, that's a problem, just fine.	E, ke bothata, hantle feela.
I'm sorry for you.	Ke utloile bohloko bakeng sa hao.
Of course, they were here.	Ha e le hantle, ba ne ba le teng mona.
You know such things.	Lintho tse joalo ua li tseba.
I never thought my life would be so good.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore bophelo ba ka bo ka ba molemo hakana.
I opened the car door.	Ke ile ka bula lemati la koloi.
By then it is too late.	Ka nako eo e se e le morao haholo.
He did not need it.	O ne a sa e hloke.
I knew nothing.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe letho.
Power.	Matla.
It was great to get your call.	E bile hantle ho fumana mohala oa hau.
I go back to doing nothing.	Ke khutlela ho se etse letho.
Mom and Dad seem to love you.	Mme le mme o bonahala a o rata.
Tell friends and family about it.	Bolella metsoalle le ba lelapa ho bona.
I would not do that.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa joalo.
And no one else likes it.	Mme ha ho le e mong ya ratang.
She looked at her son.	A sheba mora wa hae.
They did not stop until he reached them.	Ha baa ka ba ema ho fihlela a ba fihlela.
Look.	Sheba.
But the truth is more problematic.	Empa 'nete ke bothata ho feta.
He was saying something.	O ne a bua ho hong.
We are not ours.	Ha re ba rona.
However, we do not have the time or space for that.	Leha ho le joalo, ha re na nako kapa sebaka sa seo.
That's it.	Ke eona eo.
It's a beautiful place.	Ke sebaka se setle.
It is my bedroom now.	Ke kamore ea ka ea ho robala hona joale.
Usually there was no problem.	Hangata ho ne ho se bothata.
That's the way it is.	Ke kamoo ho leng kateng.
He had never told them.	O ne a eso ba bolelle.
Finally.	Qetellong.
But the question was not valid.	Empa potso e ne e se na matla.
But he had to comment.	Empa o ne a tlameha ho fana ka maikutlo.
Why, he's really been crying.	Hobaneng, ehlile esale a lla.
Come in with you.	Kena le wena.
Everyone knows that, and everyone knew it then.	E mong le e mong o tseba seo, mme bohle ba ne ba e tseba ka nako eo.
Nice picture.	Setšoantšo se setle.
We went in to see who it was.	Re ile ra kena ho bona hore na ke mang.
His own were certainly not.	Ba hae ka sebele ba ne ba eso be teng.
I was not here for it.	Ke ne ke se mona bakeng sa eona.
I have nothing to do.	Ha ke na lintho tseo nka li etsang.
You can be the best.	U ka ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
However, sometimes it did.	Leha ho le joalo, ka linako tse ling e ne e etsa joalo.
Up to that point, he was taking it one day at a time.	Ho fihlela ka nako eo, o ne a e nka letsatsi le le leng ka nako.
We did not know why.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na hobaneng.
You can't be in it that long.	U ke ke ua ba ho eona nako e telele hakaalo.
I would give up things.	Ke ne ke tla tlohela lintho.
Her husband was returning home from work to find her crying.	Monna oa hae o ne a khutla mosebetsing a mo fumane a lla.
I'm so scared of him.	Ke mo tšaba haholo.
I didn’t do it.	Ke ne ke sa e etsa.
He was not in so much pain.	O ne a sa utloa bohloko hakaalo.
You want both people to want it equally.	U batla hore batho ka bobeli ba e batle ka ho lekana.
I have this.	Ke na le sena.
And so it is with everyone else.	'Me ho joalo le ho bohle ba bang.
Here it is.	Ke ena.
I thought you felt the same way.	Ke ne ke nahana hore le uena u ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
The last one is for production.	Ea ho qetela ke ea tlhahiso.
If we stop, it will be too late.	Ha re ka ema, e tla be e se e le morao haholo.
It would have been fun.	Ho ka be ho bile monate.
With us.	Le rona.
Next, just check if you are done.	Ka mor'a moo, sheba feela hore na u se u qetile.
Until last night.	Ho fihlela bosiung ba maobane.
Please stay home unless needed.	Ka kopo, lula hae ntle le haeba ho hlokahala.
Yet they are here.	Leha ho le joalo ba teng mona.
You can say nothing.	O ka se bue letho.
He is a good boy.	Ke moshanyana e motle.
But they were all still alive.	Empa kaofela ba ne ba ntse ba phela.
And he was great.	Mme o ne a le moholo.
They keep books.	Ba boloka libuka.
Finally, they did.	Qetellong, ba etsa joalo.
He says everyone is happy and should not.	O re motho e mong le e mong o thabile mme ha a lokela.
If you want to win, you need friends.	Haeba u batla ho hlola, u hloka metsoalle.
You will get a job again.	U tla fumana mosebetsi hape.
The good man asked what he could do for her.	Monna ea molemo o ile a botsa hore na a ka mo etsetsa eng.
They had just had their first child.	Ba ne ba sa tsoa ba le ngoana oa bona oa pele.
We'll see about that.	Re tla bona ka seo.
Of course this means.	Ehlile sena se bolela .
There was no food, either.	Ho ne ho se na lijo, le hona.
Just take his name.	Nka lebitso la hae feela.
I tried to play it.	Ke ile ka leka ho e bapala.
All anyone has to do is try.	Seo mang kapa mang a lokelang ho se etsa ke ho leka.
You will not be able to get out tonight.	U ke ke ua khona ho tsoa bosiung bona.
We're just playing.	Re bapala feela.
The children in the first and second grades continued to read.	Bana ba sehlopha sa pele le sa bobeli ba ile ba tsoela pele ho bala.
And we will do that for many years.	Hape re tla etsa joalo ka lilemo tse ngata.
If you want to work, you work.	Haeba u batla ho sebetsa, ua sebetsa.
This is the funniest thing for me.	Sena ke se monate ka ho fetisisa ho 'na.
Then he came back thinking of something else.	Eaba o khutla hape ha a ntse a nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
However, they kept talking.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ile ba tsoela pele ho bua.
They should not sleep at all.	Ho hang ha baa lokela ho robala hammoho.
If there was no name, no name was needed.	Haeba ho ne ho se na lebitso, ho ne ho sa hlokahale lebitso.
But this is important.	Empa sena ke sa bohlokoa.
You can hear it but you will not see it.	U ka e utloa empa u ke ke ua e bona.
Think of it as a coming celebration.	Nahana ka eona e le mokete o tlang.
Yet their children could not keep up.	Leha ho le joalo bana ba bona ba ne ba sa khone ho tsoela pele.
But that was no longer the life he wanted.	Empa boo e ne e se e se bona bophelo boo a neng a bo batla.
He certainly did not go alone.	Ka sebele o ne a sa tsamaea a le mong.
Perhaps you feel the same way.	Mohlomong le uena u ikutloa ka tsela eo.
He may desire such things.	A ka lakatsa lintho tse joalo.
The one we want.	Eo re mo batlang.
He was just shy.	O ne a le lihlong feela.
Real life, as they say.	Bophelo ba sebele, joalo ka ha ba bolela.
I'm just saying a thing.	Ke mpa ke bolela taba feela.
She hoped her children would understand.	O ne a tšepa hore bana ba hae ba tla utloisisa.
No one could tell me why.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka mpolella lebaka.
He used to start first.	O ne a tloaetse ho qala pele.
I did not like that.	Ke ne ke sa rate seo.
It will be fun to see it.	Ho tla ba monate ho o bona.
The whole house was crying out loud.	Ntlo kaofela e ne e lla ka matla.
Of course, it is better for them to be that way.	Ke 'nete hore ho molemo hore ba be joalo.
The doctor tried to diagnose her, but she could not understand the doctor.	Ngaka e ile ea mo leka, empa e ne e sa utloisise ngaka.
It's nice to have my real son again.	Ho monate ho ba le mora oa ka oa sebele hape.
It was the first time he had ever been there.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele a fihla moo.
But otherwise he was just talking.	Empa ho seng joalo o ne a bua feela.
But when this happens, he is in a lot of pain.	Empa ha ho etsahala, o utloa bohloko haholo.
So to speak.	Kahoo ho bua.
I hear him now.	Kea mo utloa hona joale.
He made a mistake.	O entse phoso.
I will meet you.	Ke tla kopana le wena.
It was good that he did.	E bile hantle hore ebe o ile a etsa joalo.
However, it is even more so.	Leha ho le joalo, ho joalo le ho feta.
How do you sleep?	U robala joang?
It's too close.	E haufi haholo.
To me, this is not a simple matter.	Ho 'na, taba ena ha e bonolo haholo.
Every time we take care of it.	Nako le nako rea e hlokomela.
But here is my problem.	Empa bothata ba ka ke bona.
I look at them hard.	Ke li sheba ka thata.
I was so tired of hearing them.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo ke ho li utloa.
Like a week later.	Joalo ka beke morao.
He is older than I am and we have been here.	O moholo ho 'na le oa ka re bile mona.
I have the same issue.	Ke na le taba e tšoanang.
Now he is looking for the same job.	Hona joale o ntse a batla mosebetsi o tšoanang.
That's what we wanted to do.	Ke ntho eo re neng re batla ho e etsa.
The situation was difficult for the doctor.	Boemo bo ne bo le boima ho ngaka.
It's hard to imagine that now.	Ho thata ho nahana seo jwale.
The father and son were close.	Ntate le mora ba ne ba le haufi.
I have to admit he is in some kind of danger.	Ke tlameha ho lumela hore o kotsing ea mofuta o itseng.
You or he may have a job.	Uena kapa eena a ka ba le mosebetsi.
It does not seem so.	Ha ho bonahale eka ho joalo.
And you should be equal to me.	Mme o lokela ho lekana le nna.
Then you can comment.	Joale u ka fana ka maikutlo.
This is what he is like.	Sena ke seo a tšoanang le sona.
I'm afraid to go out.	Ke tšaba ho tsoa.
He tried to think of something else.	O ile a leka ho nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
And maybe there's still somebody.	Mme mohlomong ho ntse ho na le motho.
I mean the son never existed.	Ke bolela hore mora o ne a eso be teng.
And maybe so.	'Me mohlomong ho joalo.
It was not wrong, it certainly was him.	Ho ne ho se phoso, ka sebele e ne e le eena.
I know you will.	Kea tseba hore u tla.
I'm going back to that.	Ke ntse ke khutlela ho seo.
They needed to let go of it.	Ba ne ba hloka ho e tlohela.
I could actually see this happening.	Ka sebele ke ne ke bona sena se etsahala.
But, this is happening.	Empa, sena se etsahala.
Do not repair.	Se ke oa lokisa.
But then it all came to me.	Empa joale tsohle li ile tsa tla ho 'na.
I'm sure of that.	Ke na le bonnete ba hoo.
At first, she was very pretty.	Pele, o ne a le motle haholo.
This would help you to understand them and to learn from them.	Sena se ne se tla u thusa ho li utloisisa le ho ithuta ho tsona.
It was fun.	Ho ne ho le monate.
This will not happen.	Sena se ke ke sa etsahala.
He will usually not refuse certain foods.	Hangata ha a na ho hana lijo tse itseng.
You have to do something about it. 	U lokela ho etsa ho hong ka eona. 
are you working today ?.	u sebetsa kajeno?.
They looked closely.	Ba ile ba sheba haufi.
Wait, we need to fix this.	Ema, re lokela ho lokisa taba ena.
This will be my job.	Ona e tla ba mosebetsi oa ka.
Writing is easy.	Ho ngola ho bonolo.
And he knew her well.	Mme o ne a mo tseba hantle.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore ha ba joalo.
Some seem new.	Tse ling li bonahala li le ncha.
It is very difficult to understand.	Ho thata haholo ho re utloisisa.
He arrived several hours later.	O ile a fihla ka mor'a lihora tse ngata.
It is important.	E bohlokoa.
I really like to see that.	Ke hlile ke rata ho bona seo.
I was fun.	Ke ne ke le monate.
Children must go to school.	Bana ba tlameha ho ea sekolong.
And that is happening here.	Mme seo se etsahala mona.
Because you are important.	Hobane u bohlokoa.
That is none of your business.	Seo ha se taba ea hau.
Paying for things.	Ho lefa lintho.
Somehow he walks away.	Ka tsela e itseng oa tsamaea.
He never asked to keep her.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a kopa ho mo boloka.
Anyone with a mind could do that.	Mang kapa mang ea nang le kelello o ne a ka etsa joalo.
We are used to it.	Re e tloaetse.
We will be better.	Re tla be re le betere.
So they come with everything.	Kahoo ba tla le tsohle.
This work is in progress.	Mosebetsi ona o ntse o tsoela pele.
I was looking for a real house, and I found it.	Ke ne ke batla ntlo ea 'nete, 'me ka e fumana.
Now, life was simple.	Joale, bophelo bo ne bo le bonolo.
I found something strange.	Ke fumane ntho e makatsang.
But Mother did not want to.	Empa ’Mè o ne a sa batle.
True, but there is a way to fix it.	Ke 'nete, empa ho na le mokhoa oa ho e lokisa.
He couldn't watch anything else.	O ne a ke ke a shebella letho le leng.
It's not so fun.	Ha ho monate hakaalo.
Time was of the essence here.	Nako e ne e le bohlokoa mona.
But even that would not be so helpful now.	Empa le hoo ho ne ho ke ke ha thusa hakaalo hona joale.
He finally found his team there.	Qetellong o ile a fumana sehlopha sa hae moo.
I knew this was true.	Ke ne ke tseba hore sena ke ’nete.
It was too much to keep.	E ne e le ngata haholo ho boloka.
I was grateful.	Ke ile ka leboha.
We can be like that.	Re ka ba joalo.
His head!	Hlooho ea hae!
They could not walk well alone.	Ba ne ba sa khone ho tsamaea hantle ba le bang.
He looked great and dangerous.	O ne a shebahala a le moholo a bile a le kotsi.
You need one.	U hloka e le 'ngoe.
Would you please go outside?	O ka tsoela ka ntle ka kopo?
I'll just see you.	Ke tla o bona feela.
How could you let him do this? '.	U ne u ka mo lumella joang ho etsa see?'.
I will be waiting for you.	Ke tla be ke u lebeletse.
But it is very simple.	Empa ho bonolo haholo.
We need to think that way.	Re lokela ho nahana ka tsela eo.
The night was heavy.	Bosiu bo ne bo le boima.
Of course I had seen theirs.	Ehlile ke ne ke bone tsa bona.
To me, this was the strangest thing there was.	Ho 'na, ena e ne e le ntho e makatsang ka ho fetisisa e teng.
But he obviously had it.	Empa ho hlakile hore o ne a e-na le eona.
We have no food, so we cannot give you food.	Ha re na lijo, kahoo re ke ke ra u fa lijo.
But everyone just stared at him.	Empa bohle ba ile ba mo sheba feela.
What he does, no one else does.	Seo a se etsang, ha ho motho e mong ea se etsang.
We go in and go as we please.	Re kena le ho tsamaea kamoo re ratang kateng.
Something like that.	Ntho e kang eo.
This was close to what he needed.	Sena se ne se le haufi le seo a neng a se hloka.
Not everyone will be an expert.	Ha se bohle ba tla ba setsebi.
Truly like him.	Ka 'nete joaloka eena.
But she will still cry.	Empa o ntse o tla lla.
So, friends learn from each other.	Kahoo, metsoalle e ithuta ho e mong.
I belong to everyone.	Ke ea bohle.
Do nothing or try to make it go away.	U se ke ua etsa letho kapa ua leka ho etsa hore e tsamaee.
He wants to do it for you.	O batla ho u etsetsa eona.
he asked.	a botsa.
Or whether he felt that it was not his business.	Kapa hore na o ne a nka hore hase taba ea hae.
When he got home.	Ha a fihla hae.
I know you, now.	Ke a o tseba, jwale.
So we stopped again.	Kahoo re ile ra ema hape.
And that didn't help him much.	Mme seo ha se a ka sa mo thusa hakaalo.
Apara lieta.	Apara lieta.
But most people never do that.	Empa batho ba bangata ha ho mohla ba etsang joalo.
Then we work again.	Ebe re sebetsa hape.
We were used to this.	Re ne re tloaetse sena.
We know they are.	Rea tseba hore ba joalo.
Here is my opinion.	Mona ke maikutlo a ka.
There was nothing enough.	Ho ne ho se letho le lekaneng.
I'm not sure what we know.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na re tseba eng.
I can't understand the problem.	Ha ke khone ho utloisisa bothata.
We do it because we have to.	Re e etsa hobane re tlameha.
There is something strange about this, he thought.	Ho na le ho hong ho makatsang ka sena, o ile a nahana.
You can too.	Le uena u ka etsa sena.
If he was there.	Haeba a ne a le teng.
I went there.	Ke ile moo.
However, they are not many.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ba bangata.
It's fun !!!! 	Ho monate!!!!
None of them were very close to the others.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a le haufi haholo le ba bang.
He took his time coming.	O ile a nka nako ea hae ho tla.
Maybe he'll come back again.	Mohlomong o tla fihla morao hape.
But when you know it well you try to do better.	Empa ha o tseba hantle o leka ho etsa betere.
We need a few things.	Re hloka lintho tse seng kae.
She did all she could to help others.	O ile a etsa sohle seo a ka se khonang ho thusa ba bang.
So, more than that, like.	Joalo, ho feta joalo, joalo ka.
He was sure it did.	O ne a na le bonnete ba hore e entse joalo.
Another way to see it.	Tsela e 'ngoe ea ho e bona.
It still needs work.	E ntse e hloka mosebetsi.
Now you see it.	Joale ua e bona.
I love you more than life.	Ke o rata ho feta bophelo.
We enjoyed the food so much that we came back for dinner.	Re ile ra thabela lijo hoo re ileng ra khutla bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
He needed a place.	O ne a hloka sebaka se itseng.
He made it fun, easy and understandable.	O ile a etsa hore ho be monate, ho be bonolo le ho utloisisa.
I may never see many of them again.	Mohlomong nke ke ka hlola ke bona ba bangata ba bona hape.
Do those three.	Etsa tse tharo tseo.
I can't today.	Ha ke khone kajeno.
We need to do the same.	Le rōna re lokela ho etsa joalo.
He would have a good job.	O ne a tla ba le mosebetsi o motle.
I was talking about his name.	Ke ne ke bolela ka lebitso la hae.
Being on the ground, it is important.	Ho ba teng fatše, ho bohlokoa.
I was the last one.	Ke ne ke le oa ho qetela.
It must be beautiful.	E tlameha ebe e ntle.
I didn't even know what it was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe le hore na ke eng.
If you don't want to live, so be it.	Haeba u sa batle ho phela, ho be joalo.
Before you were together, she did not feel the need to tell you.	Pele le le hammoho, o ne a sa bone bohlokoa ba ho le bolella.
I do not meet you.	Ha ke kopane le uena.
It's not too long now.	Ha se nako e telele joale.
There were so many other things going on.	Ho ne ho e-na le litaba tse ling tse ngata tse neng li etsahala.
He wants it at home.	O o batla hae.
And it will stand until tomorrow.	Mme e tla ema ho fihlela hosane.
And again, thank you in advance.	'Me hape, ke leboha esale pele.
Besides, he did well.	Ntle le moo, o entse hantle.
Look at a few more.	Sheba tse seng kae hape.
We need you.	Rea u hloka.
I did it because it was work.	Ke e entse hobane e ne e le mosebetsi.
And good, that's right.	'Me e ntle, ho joalo.
He asked some difficult questions.	O ile a botsa lipotso tse thata.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
I will earn money again.	Ke tla fumana chelete hape.
We have worked together before.	Re kile ra sebetsa hammoho pele .
He would do it.	O ne a tla e etsa.
I've been there before.	Ke bile teng pele.
We are all here and we love it.	Kaofela re teng mme rea o rata.
I saw them once.	Ke ba bone hang.
Now, you finally do something.	Jwale, qetellong o etsa ho hong.
They just came and went.	Ba ile ba tla feela ba tsamaea.
That no longer exists.	Seo ha se sa le teng.
Because it's more than that.	Hobane e ngata ho feta moo.
He could have passed it.	A ka be a ile a e feta.
So what you do is think of someone else.	Kahoo seo u se etsang ke ho nahana ka motho e mong.
However, his father does not want him to do that.	Leha ho le joalo, ntate oa hae ha a batle hore a etse joalo.
It just didn't seem to fit.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ha ea lekana.
How can we help such ones?	Re ka thusa batho baa joang?
Your decision here.	Qeto ea hau mona.
Go with your mind.	Tsamaea le kelello ea hau.
I had no reason not to do so.	Ke ne ke se na lebaka la ho se etse joalo.
There would be a mistake.	Ho ne ho tla ba le phoso.
And that is what we wanted.	Mme ke seo re neng re se batla.
After that, she started reading.	Ka mor’a moo, o ile a qala ho bala.
We know what it takes to do things.	Rea tseba hore na ho hlokahala eng ho etsa lintho.
I found it very powerful.	Ke ile ka e fumana e le matla haholo.
Li does not believe that his wife should tell us anything.	Li ha a lumele hore mosali oa hae o lokela ho re bolella letho.
Image, of course.	Setšoantšo, ehlile.
I was very tired.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo.
He always learns hard.	O lula a ithuta ka thata.
That comes first, too.	Hoo ke ntho e tlang pele, hape.
Because it is not.	Hobane ha ho joalo.
But you will not want to do this.	Empa u ke ke ua batla ho etsa sena.
Eventually he would tell her.	Qetellong o ne a tla mo bolella.
We just have to start fast.	Feela re tlameha ho qala kapele.
Do not come to my room.	U se ke ua tla kamoreng ea ka.
Continue please.	Tsoela pele ka kopo.
He was alone.	E ne e le mong.
It really is a good book.	Ehlile ke buka e monate.
It's my family.	Ke lelapa la ka.
Here I can take this.	Mona nka sena.
What that meant, he was not sure.	Hore na hoo ho ne ho bolela eng, o ne a sa tsebe hantle.
This is something we all have.	Ena ke ntho eo bohle re nang le eona.
But the first mistake was not his.	Empa phoso ea pele e ne e se ea hae.
It is usually a family.	Hangata ke lelapa.
So he decided to look again.	Kahoo o ile a etsa qeto ea ho sheba hape.
Meeting them was amazing.	Ho kopana le bona e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
His news was not so good.	Litaba tsa hae li ne li se monate hakaalo.
I know what his job is.	Kea tseba hore na mosebetsi oa hae ke ofe.
We love the team so much.	Re rata sehlopha haholo.
Maybe he knew what was coming.	Mohlomong o ne a tseba se tlang.
This is very important.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo.
I don't know what they will do next.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ba tla etsa'ng ka mor'a moo.
Your team will work as well as it has.	Sehlopha sa hau se tla sebetsa hantle ha se ntse se le sona.
I can't find those books.	Ha ke khone ho fumana libuka tseo.
I am now.	Ke 'na hona joale.
Whose is this?	Sena ke sa mang?
It didn't help either.	Le 'na ha ea thusa.
And off we go.	Mme rea tloha.
They were emotional.	Ba ne ba ena le maikutlo.
He thought he would always be a boy.	O ne a nahana hore o tla dula e le moshanyana.
My mother has never met my children.	'Mè oa ka ha a e-s'o kopane le bana ba ka.
Get some water.	Fumana metsi.
I can't live without you.	Ha ke khone ho phela ntle le uena.
I want that to be weird.	Ke batla seo e be ntho e makatsang.
It seemed.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka .
I am sure, as I am.	Ke na le bonnete, joalo ka nna.
You do them.	U li etsa.
You can never go out again.	U ke ke ua hlola u tsoa hape.
When he had finished speaking, he left.	Ha a qeta ho bua, o ile a tsamaea.
Don't like this place?	Ha u rate sebaka see?
He provided it.	O ile a fana ka eona.
Maybe there is an opportunity.	Mohlomong monyetla o teng.
He wants you for the same reason.	O u batla ka lebaka le tšoanang.
We know more about that now.	Re tseba haholoanyane ka seo hona joale.
This would not be good.	Sena se ka se be molemo.
It's mine.	Ke oa ka.
It really was.	E ne e hlile e le eona.
They have no sense in them.	Ha ba na mohopolo ho bona.
So that you can learn things of this nature.	E le hore u tsebe ho ithuta lintho tsa mofuta ona.
Unless breakfast is too late.	Ntle le haeba lijo tsa hoseng li le morao haholo.
He wondered how long it would take.	O ne a ipotsa hore na ho tla nka nako e kae.
I hope you will read it soon.	Ke tšepa u tla e bala haufinyane.
We can't say we wanted them.	Re ke ke ra re re ne re li batla.
It can happen again.	E ka etsahala hape.
They both knew the truth.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba tseba ’nete.
The work he enjoyed.	Mosebetsi oo a neng a o thabela.
The only truth is here.	'Nete feela e teng mona.
It was exactly what he expected.	E ne e le seo a neng a se lebeletse.
Don't think of a man.	O seke wa nahana ka monna.
Some do not.	Ba bang ha ba etse joalo.
If it works for them.	Haeba e sebetsa ho bona.
So kind of.	Kahoo mofuta oa.
Now.	Hona joale.
No one asked him any questions.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo botsa lipotso.
Do what they say.	Etsa seo ba se buang.
You speak like a child.	U bua joalo ka ngoana.
I will say it again.	Ke tla e bua hape.
It was your idea to come here.	E ne e le mohopolo oa hau ho tla mona.
She had no children.	O ne a se na bana.
My old bicycle was now useless.	Baesekele ea ka ea khale e ne e se e se na thuso hona joale.
If you.	Haeba u.
They did not have time for this.	Ba ne ba sena nako ya sena.
Nobody would stand to help you.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tla ema ho u thusa.
She has very beautiful hair.	O na le moriri o motle haholo.
The family really did not need that much.	Ruri lelapa le ne le sa hloke hakaalo.
Man.	Motho .
Now I am older than my parents were.	Hona joale ke se ke le moholo ho feta kamoo batsoali ba ka ba neng ba le kateng.
Of having children.	Ea ho ba le bana.
We take care of our own.	Re hlokomela tsa rona.
Of course you want.	Ehlile batla.
There is something strange about what he is doing.	Ho na le ho hong ho makatsang ka seo a se etsang.
There was nothing they could do.	Ho ne ho se seo ba ka se etsang.
I have not read the book.	Ha kea bala buka eo.
We just played.	Re sa tsoa bapala.
That is exactly what happened.	Ke sona hantle se etsahetseng.
She looked very pretty.	O ne a bonahala a le motle haholo.
But it was the first time it was our best idea.	Empa e ne e le lekhetlo la pele leo e leng mohopolo oa rona o motle ka ho fetisisa.
The only thing you can be is you.	Seo u ka bang sona feela ke uena.
It would not help.	E ne e ke ke ea thusa letho.
I cried.	Ke ile ka lla.
There are so many things we haven't talked about.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo re sa kang ra bua ka tsona.
But he did not.	Empa ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
He needed help.	O ne a hloka thuso.
These were the ones.	Tsena e ne e le tsona.
Because he was there and he knew it.	Hobane o ne a le teng mme o ne a e tseba.
My last week is his first.	Beke ea ka ea ho qetela ke ea hae ea pele.
Who knows, maybe they will.	Ke mang ea tsebang, mohlomong ba tla etsa joalo.
I'm not sure about that.	Ha ke na bonnete ka seo.
However, he did.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a etsa joalo.
Then what.	Ebe joale eng.
And it stays that way for hours.	'Me e lula e le joalo ka lihora tse ngata.
He only looked once at his place.	O ile a sheba hang feela sebakeng sa hae.
Pretty hard.	E ntle e thata.
But I can't find it.	Empa ha ke e fumane.
It can be original or modern.	E ka ba ea pele kapa ea kajeno.
What it did.	Seo e se entseng.
You just do your job.	O etsa mosebetsi wa hao feela.
Type of way.	Mofuta oa tsela.
Her father noticed.	Ntate oa hae o ile a hlokomela.
Things were good then.	Lintho li ne li le ntle ka nako eo.
It really didn't connect.	E ne e hlile e sa kopane.
I want feedback.	Ke batla maikutlo.
I just want us to be close again.	Ke batla feela hore re be haufi hape.
It will be busy here.	Ho tla be ho phathahane mona.
They're done.	Ba qetile.
He was still alive.	O ne a ntse a phela.
And it could be better.	Mme ho ka ba betere.
I'll tell you something.	Ke tla o bolella ho hong.
Life was hard.	Bophelo bo ne bo le thata.
I heard it.	Ke ile ka e utloa.
He felt that he loved them.	O ne a ikutloa hore oa ba rata.
In fact, it is very good.	Ka 'nete, e ntle haholo.
I was not expecting anything.	Ke ne ke sa lebella letho.
They were arrested unexpectedly.	Ba ile ba tšoaroa ba sa lebella.
We knew and understood that.	Re ne re tseba le ho utloisisa seo.
Most of us have never seen anything like it before.	Ba bangata ba rōna ha re e-s’o ka re bona ntho e kang ena pele.
That's great.	Ke hantle haholo.
We save a lot of money.	Re boloka chelete e ngata.
You can try that.	O ka leka seo.
He is doing so now.	O etsa joalo hona joale.
I open it first.	Ke e bula pele.
The current one will still work.	Ea hona joale e ntse e tla sebetsa.
It is my only regret.	Ke masoabi a ka a le mong.
I love you both so much.	Ke le rata haholo ka bobeli.
I will try that method.	Ke tla leka mokhoa oo.
That's what they think.	Ke seo ba se nahanang.
He could not get out.	O ne a sa khone ho tsoa.
There is no dinner.	Ha ho na lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I am sure it will be one of those.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore e tla ba ba bang ba seo.
Check out the location of my new home.	Sheba sebaka sa ntlo ea ka e ncha.
I can't get enough.	Ha ke khone ho lekana.
But do something.	Empa etsa ho hong.
And maybe it was nothing.	'Me mohlomong e ne e se letho.
Or they seem to do so.	Kapa ho bonahala ba etsa joalo.
He said it was your place.	A re ke sebaka sa hao.
What should we do? 	Re lokela ho etsa’ng?
asked the boy.	ha botsa moshanyana.
It was really hard to play with this team.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le thata ho bapala le sehlopha sena.
Think again.	Nahana hape.
It is never so easy.	Ha ho mohla e leng bonolo hakaalo.
They will return.	Ba tla khutla.
They just exist, and that's what they are.	Ba teng feela, mme ke seo ba leng sona.
We never looked at anything.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra sheba letho.
This place has always been the most important.	Sebaka sena e kile ea e-ba sa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
You have no time to think.	Ha u na nako ea ho nahana.
Of course, he did not.	Ha e le hantle, ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
He took the letter.	O ile a nka lengolo.
The time he wanted.	Nako eo a neng a e batla.
It is a place we love.	Ke sebaka seo re se ratang.
On the second day.	Ka letsatsi la bobeli.
They will not learn.	Ba ke ke ba ithuta.
So you want another reason to cry.	Kahoo u batla lebaka le leng la ho lla.
When you read, read.	Ha u bala, bala.
It is something you can or cannot do.	Ke ntho eo u ka e etsang kapa ha u e etse.
I love both of those things, too.	Ke rata lintho tseo ka bobeli, hape.
So he stood with me.	Kahoo a ema le nna.
It could have been someone else.	Ho ne ho ka etsahala hore ebe ho ne ho e-na le motho e mong.
There is no time to sit down.	Ha ho na nako ea ho lula fatše.
His reason was that he had a headache.	Lebaka la hae e ne e le hore o ne a tšoeroe ke hlooho.
What is nearby.	Tse haufi ke eng.
She started to cry again.	A qala ho lla hape.
He came in just right.	O ile a kena hantle feela.
We arrive home that night.	Re fihla ha hae bosiung boo.
Close, yet close.	Haufi, leha ho le joalo haufi.
He has three days to live.	O na le matsatsi a mararo a ho phela.
Something is wrong here.	Ho na le phoso mona.
It is easy to see why.	Ho bonolo ho bona lebaka.
I can't find it.	Nke ke ka e fumana.
This place is a great place to eat.	Sebaka sena ke sebaka se setle sa lijo.
Leaving would be difficult.	Ho tloha ho ne ho tla ba thata.
For the great good.	Bakeng sa molemo o moholo.
The young man was living his best life.	Mohlankana o ne a phela bophelo ba hae bo molemo ka ho fetisisa.
One must go on living.	Motho o tlameha ho tsoela pele a phela.
That was all he could do.	E ne e le sohle seo a neng a ka se etsa.
Each house has one bedroom.	Ntlo e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le kamore e le 'ngoe ea ho robala.
There will be more to come.	Ho tla ba le tse ngata tse tlang.
I just took care of everyone.	Ke ne ke mpa ke hlokomela bohle.
To talk to him that way.	Hore a bue le eena ka tsela eo.
Things are going well.	Lintho li tsamaea hantle.
Do not tell anyone that.	O seke wa bolella motho seo.
But it does not seem possible.	Empa ha ho bonahale ho ka etsahala.
Whatever you do, please do not let her see you cry.	Eng kapa eng eo u e etsang, ka kopo u se ke ua lumella hore a u bone u lla.
It was that easy.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ka tsela eo.
The teacher was not pleased to see her.	Tichere ha ea ka ea thabela ho mo bona.
But we need to help them.	Empa re hloka ho ba thusa.
Certainly not his.	Ehlile ha se ea hae.
Or maybe not.	Kapa mohlomong ha ho joalo.
You told us about him.	Ke uena ea ileng a re bolella ka eena.
People see what they want to see.	Batho ba bona seo ba batlang ho se bona.
It had been a very long time.	E ne e se e le nako e telele haholo.
That time is now.	Nako eo ke jwale.
Where are we going?	Re ea kae?
Waiting for him.	Ho mo emetse.
He could not see that she loved him.	O ne a ke ke a bona hore oa mo rata.
Three days ago.	Matsatsi a mararo a fetileng.
That was us.	Eo e ne e le rona.
He watched as someone arrived.	O ile a shebella ha e mong a fihla.
There are still many questions.	Ho ntse ho na le lipotso tse ngata.
Night after night he kept making suggestions.	Bosiu bosiu a 'na a etsa tlhahiso.
So that's one thing.	Kahoo ke ntho e le 'ngoe.
You will be fine.	U tla phela hantle.
Here are a few of them.	Mona ke tse seng kae tsa tsona.
I know who.	Ke tseba mang.
He could feel how tired he was.	O ne a utloa hore na o khathetse hakae.
I work much better.	Ke sebetsa betere haholo.
Only coffee would be fine.	Kofi feela e ka ba hantle.
Work is underway in this area.	Mosebetsi o ntse o tsoela pele sebakeng sena.
In the end, it makes everyone feel better.	Qetellong, e etsa hore bohle ba be betere.
You can't be more wrong.	O ka se be phoso ho feta.
He will still do better than most.	O ntse a tla etsa betere ho feta ba bangata.
I know you did not.	Kea tseba hore ha ua ka ua etsa joalo.
Be very careful!	Hlokomela haholo!
I hope you enjoyed reading this.	Ke tšepa hore u thabetse ho bala sena.
He had done this.	O ne a entse sena.
I really have to work on that.	Ruri ke lokela ho sebetsa ho seo.
There is no one behind us.	Haho motho ya ka mora rona.
None of it is important because we have others.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea eona ea bohlokoa hobane re na le ba bang.
I went to talk to them.	Ke ile ka ea bua le bona.
I'm sorry for that.	Ke masoabi bakeng sa.
She feels that her life is in vain.	O ikutloa hore bophelo ba hae ha bo na thuso.
It still doesn't get it.	E ntse e sa e fumane.
She says her teacher might keep it.	O re tichere ea hae e ka 'na ea e boloka.
Take your hours.	Nka lihora tsa hau.
None of them seemed to be real.	Ha ho le e ’ngoe ea tsona e neng e bonahala e le ea sebele.
But no one does that.	Empa haho motho ya etsang seo.
The head had no name.	Hlooho e ne e se na lebitso.
Last year is the past.	Selemong se fetileng ke nakong e fetileng.
That would be nice.	Seo se tla ba molemo.
To keep it alive.	Ho e boloka e phela.
This, as we know, did not happen.	Sena, joalo ka ha re tseba, ha sea etsahala.
I feel your pain.	Ke utloa bohloko ba hao.
However, I worked with them.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ile ka sebetsa le bona.
We are better than this.	Re betere ho feta mona.
They did not know that he was there.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe hore o teng.
Everyone is there.	Motho e mong le e mong o teng.
Yes, you can do whatever you want.	E, u ka khona ho etsa ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe eo u ka e batlang.
It's that kind of place.	Ke sebaka sa mofuta oo.
But he will not do that.	Empa a ke ke a etsa joalo.
That's really my problem.	Ke bothata ba ka ruri.
Which is how we know what was going to happen.	E leng hore na re tseba joang se neng se lokela ho etsahala.
We have enough money to start a project.	Re na le chelete e lekaneng ho qala mosebetsi.
We had to go and look for him.	Re ile ra tlameha ho ea mo batla.
I will stay with you.	Ke tla dula le wena.
He was the greatest of them all.	O ne a le moholo ho bona kaofela.
I am thirty years old.	Ke lilemo li mashome a mararo.
It would think.	E ne e tla nahana.
He kept doing what he was doing.	O ile a dula a etsa seo a neng a se etsa.
I did not want to go back to my room.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho khutlela kamoreng ea ka.
You probably will not achieve this.	Mohlomong u ke ke ua fihlela sena.
I still loved him.	Ke ne ke ntse ke mo rata.
Does anyone know anything?	Na ho na le motho ea tsebang letho?
We feel your pain.	Re utloa bohloko ba hao.
He was a truthful boy.	E ne e le moshanyana ea buang 'nete.
He never went back to school.	Ha aa ka a khutlela sekolong.
And boy, do they.	Mme moshanyana, na ba etsa jwalo.
And she is very simple.	Mme o bonolo haholo.
Take him to see if he has any money.	Mo nke o bone hore na o na le chelete.
However it will not happen.	Leha ho le joalo e ke ke ea etsahala.
He often writes about his work.	Hangata o ngola ka mosebetsi oa hae.
He passed.	O ile a feta.
I'm here for you.	Ke mona ka lebaka la hau.
If you can't pay, you won't be able to sign in.	Haeba u sa khone ho lefa, u ke ke ua khona ho kena.
By his nature.	Ka mofuta oa hae.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
I wanted to get out of there.	Ke ne ke batla ho tloha moo.
But you are already three years behind.	Empa u se u le morao haholo ka lilemo tse tharo.
Yes, they knew that.	E, ba ne ba tseba ka seo.
Hearing about his family affairs.	Ho utloa ka litaba tsa lelapa la hae.
It's as simple as it gets.	E bonolo joalo ka ha e fumana.
There is none other than this.	Ha ho le teng ntle le e 'ngoe.
The money is not mine.	Chelete ha se ea ka.
Look at it.	Sheba ho eona.
Or something in them.	Kapa ntho e be ka ho tsona.
Mention a name.	Bua ka lebitso.
It was a very good thing.	E ne e le ntho e ntle haholo.
If you want to say something, say it.	Ha o batla ho bua ho hong, e bue.
Whose house is this?	Ntlo ee ke ea mang?
But now you know.	Empa joale ua tseba.
What more do we need, of course.	Re hloka eng hape, ka 'nete.
Find a new way.	Fumana tsela e ncha.
I will take him with me.	Ke tla mo nka le nna.
You may not find anything.	U ka 'na ua se ke ua fumana letho.
You are human.	O motho.
There must be something he can do to help her.	E tlameha ebe ho na le seo a ka se etsang ho mo thusa.
He thought no one knew.	O ne a nahana hore ha ho motho ya tsebang.
Then there is each.	Ebe ho na le e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
And you know, we can't do this much.	'Me ua tseba, re ke ke ra khona ho etsa sena haholo.
He stopped.	A ema.
They would do.	Ba ne ba tla etsa.
I like spending time in it.	Ke rata ho qeta nako ho eona.
I don’t know if we ever had a chance to.	Ha ke tsebe hore re kile ra ba le monyetla oa ho.
He loved her for that.	O ne a mo rata bakeng sa seo.
I still feel good.	Ke ntse ke ikutloa hantle.
He probably lived alone.	Mohlomong o ne a lula a le mong.
People who love him.	Batho ba mo ratang.
It seemed like a long time.	E ne eka ke nako e telele.
He did not speak.	Ha a ka a bua.
Go back.	Khutlela morao.
Here is another task.	Mosebetsi o mong ke oo.
But it is not.	Empa ha se eona.
It's hard to decide what to do with it !.	Ho thata ho etsa qeto ea hore na u sebetsa ka eng!.
I will still enjoy this.	Ke sa ntse ke tla thabela sena.
I have something to say.	Ke na le seo nka se buang.
It was just as important as the news.	E ne e le ea bohlokoa haholo joaloka litaba.
He returns to the bedroom.	O khutlela kamoreng ea ho robala.
He did not need to be present.	O ne a sa hloke ho ba teng.
I want to see you.	Ke batla ho u bona.
Both are very important to me.	Ka bobeli ke tsa bohlokoa haholo ho 'na.
But almost anything happens now.	Empa hoo e ka bang eng kapa eng e ea etsahala joale.
It applies to both of them.	E sebetsa ho bona ka bobeli.
I had the last question.	Ke bile le potso ea ho qetela.
He did not know what he wanted to say.	O ne a sa tsebe seo a batlang ho se bua.
I have been doing that for years.	Ke na le lilemo ke etsa joalo.
It was really hard.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le thata.
We will work it out.	Re tla e sebetsa.
It's just weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang feela.
It wasn't that person either.	E ne e se motho eo hape.
I never want to be friends with you!	Ha ho mohla ke batlang ho ba metsoalle le uena!
He suffered for us, in our place.	O ile a utloa bohloko bakeng sa rōna, sebakeng sa rōna.
Read more about this danger.	Bala haholoanyane ka kotsi ena.
He never talked about working with her.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka ho sebetsa le eena.
He did not want to think about that.	O ne a sa batle ho nahana ka seo.
He is your son.	Ke mora oa hao.
I feel very happy.	Ke ikutloa ke thabile haholo.
That was when his career began.	Ke nakong eo mosebetsi oa hae o ileng oa qala.
Good for a child.	E ntle bakeng sa ngoana.
I have a good idea.	Ke na le mohopolo o motle.
I would not ask for such a thing.	Nke ke ka kopa ntho e joalo.
She is safe.	Ha a kotsi.
I live near it.	Ke lula haufi le eona.
You have to take life when it comes.	O tlameha ho nka bophelo ha bo fihla.
It will stay in our place.	E tla lula sebakeng sa rona.
It must have been a lot of fun.	E tlameha ebe ho monate haholo.
The law applies.	Molao oa sebetsa.
However do not use it.	Leha ho le joalo u se ke ua e sebelisa.
You see the problem.	U bona bothata.
In the evening they return home.	Mantsiboea ba khutlela hae.
She wanted to cry a lot.	O ne a batla ho lla haholo.
Probably even before that.	Mohlomong le pele ho moo.
I couldn’t work, I didn’t think.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho sebetsa, ke ne ke sa nahane.
Wonderful things are about to happen.	Ho tla etsahala lintho tse makatsang.
Nobody ever told me.	Ha ho motho ya kileng a mpolella.
Certainly not good.	Ka sebele ha e ntle.
You must be able to do these things.	U tlameha ho khona ho etsa lintho tsena.
I can do this.	Nka etsa sena.
If you don't like it, wear something else.	Ha o e rate, apara se seng.
I went in and out.	Ke ile ka tsoa le ho tsoa.
This is to be yourself and to be sure.	Sena ke ho ba uena le ho ba le bonnete.
And then living alone is no use.	'Me joale ho lula u le mong ha ho na thuso.
The picture is yours.	Setšoantšo ke sa hau.
Or the last one.	Kapa ea ho qetela.
But there is a reason for this.	Empa ho na le lebaka la sena.
It is not an easy thing.	Ha se ntho e bonolo.
I thought it was you.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke uena.
This method is very simple.	Mokhoa ona o bonolo haholo.
This is where you should sit and eat.	Mona ke moo o lokelang ho lula le ho ja.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
Things were starting to go well.	Lintho li ne li qala ho tsamaea hantle.
From there, the decision is yours.	Ho tloha moo, qeto ke ea hau.
But, that's what happens.	Empa, ke sona se etsahalang.
You can replace.	U ka nka sebaka sa .
I think that is the last thing we need.	Ke nahana hore ke ntho ea ho qetela eo re e hlokang.
He did not love her enough.	O ne a sa mo rate ka ho lekaneng.
Maybe he did.	Mohlomong o ile a etsa joalo.
The water was alive.	Metsi a ne a phela.
Lots and lots of surprises.	Tse ngata le tse ngata tse makatsang.
We still have this.	Re ntse re na le sena.
It doesn't matter.	Ha e tsotelle.
I would like to go.	Ke kopa ho tsamaea.
There was nothing he could do until then.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang ho fihlela ka nako eo.
He was not going.	O ne a sa tsamaee.
Some do not seem to have it.	Ba bang ba bonahala ba se na eona.
You have to find something to fix it.	U tlameha ho fumana ho hong ho u lokisa.
I also do not like this idea.	Le 'na ha ke rate mohopolo ona.
Get in here.	Kena ka mona.
I will be buying more !.	Ke tla be ke reka ho feta!.
There seemed to be no one.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se ba le bang.
I did not go home.	Ha kea ea le hae.
Only me and my family.	Ke 'na feela le lelapa la ka.
But somehow, in time, they became friends.	Empa ka tsela e itseng, ha nako e ntse e ea, e ile ea e-ba metsoalle.
All of them.	Kaofela .
Several police officers were present.	Mapolesa a 'maloa a ne a le teng.
Simple but delicious food.	Lijo tse bonolo empa tse monate.
Amazing stuff !!.	Lintho tse makatsang !!.
He certainly did not have time.	Ka sebele o ne a se na nako.
So most of us do not take our work seriously.	Kahoo ba bangata ba rona ha re nke mosebetsi oa rona e le oa bohlokoa.
I did not like any of them.	Ke ne ke sa rate le a mong oa bona.
I like to believe it exists.	Ke rata ho lumela hore e teng.
Very nice place.	Sebaka se setle haholo.
But this also means that you do not have to.	Empa sena se bolela hape, hore ha ua tlameha.
It has a place for.	E na le sebaka sa.
It is very important.	Ke ea bohlokoa haholo.
Probably nothing can.	Mohlomong ha ho letho le ka khonang.
Some of them are.	Ba bang ba bona ba.
But he is very good.	Empa o hantle haholo.
I want to cry but my baby is crying.	Ke batla ho lla empa ngoana oa ka oa lla.
So it will be very important there.	Kahoo ho tla ba bohlokoa haholo moo.
He is even stronger.	O matla ho feta.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea hore u tsamaee.
However, they wanted to make me invisible.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba batla ho etsa hore ke se ke ka bonahala.
Now it's gone.	Jwale e ile.
You will find my news and comments.	U tla fumana litaba le maikutlo a ka.
If I go to the bedroom, we have it !.	Haeba ke ea kamore ea ho robala, re na le eona!.
I will have a job here.	Ke tla ba le mosebetsi mona.
I would appreciate it if you could wait until then.	Ke tla e thabela ha o ka ema ho fihlela ka nako eo.
That money was nothing.	Chelete eo e ne e se letho.
So no one is here.	Kahoo ha ho motho mona.
He does not want to know the name.	Ha a batle ho tseba lebitso.
Everyone was still at home.	Bohle ba ne ba ntse ba le hae.
There was no money for that.	Ho ne ho se na chelete bakeng sa seo.
You are still my child.	U ntse u le ngoana oa ka.
No one knows why.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang lebaka.
Yet this is just my opinion.	Leha ho le joalo ena ke maikutlo a ka feela.
Nothing is too powerful.	Ha ho letho le nang le matla.
We drove for hours.	Re ile ra khanna lihora tse ngata.
It takes a lot of time.	Ho nka nako e ngata.
Maybe he saw what he did not plan to see.	Mohlomong o ile a bona seo a neng a sa rera ho se bona.
It has been up to this year.	E bile ho fihlela selemong sena.
Don't tell the police.	Se bolelle mapolesa.
This is what happened here tonight.	Sena ke se etsahetseng mona bosiung bona.
I do not know how to do this.	Ha ke tsebe ho etsa sena.
I am as tired as a dog.	Ke khathetse joalo ka ntja.
They didn't seem hard to him.	Li ne li sa bonahale li le thata ho eena.
Maybe next time!.	Mohlomong nako e tlang!.
I was going to have my kids.	Ke ne ke ntse ke tla ba le bana ba ka.
I do not understand it.	ha ke e utloisise.
To live, alone, to exist is unbelief.	Ho phela, u le mong, ho ba teng ho se lumele.
This is true.	Sena ke 'nete.
So we are not talking about this.	Kahoo ha re bue ka taba ena.
It was hard to say.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bolela.
It could be even more so.	E ka ba le ho feta.
I had not seen him for hours.	Ke ne ke qetile lihora ke sa mo bone.
You would do the same.	Le uena u ne u tla etsa joalo.
Since then we have been playing together.	Ho tloha ka nako eo esale re bapala hammoho.
Then unleash your power and go.	Joale bula matla a hao 'me u tsamaee.
And he was there.	Mme o ne a le teng.
It is not for me to refuse you.	Ha se ka ho nna ho hana ho wena.
It was something.	E ne e le ntho e itseng.
It's simple.	Ke e bonolo.
This was a good thing.	Taba ena e ne e le ntle.
One only needs to watch the news to see it.	Motho o hloka feela ho shebella litaba ho li bona.
We need to win.	Re hloka ho hlola.
Maybe you should think about his suggestion and see what happens.	Mohlomong u lokela ho nahana ka tlhahiso ea hae 'me u bone se etsahalang.
Then go to work.	Ebe u ea mosebetsing.
We did it all this morning.	Re e entse kaofela hoseng hona.
That's the whole point of it.	Ke eona taba ea bona kaofela.
This is just before you do.	Sena ke feela pele o etsa joalo.
That's what it is today.	Ke sona sa kajeno.
This was bad enough for him.	Sena se ne se le mpe ho lekana ho eena.
I was done asking.	Ke ne ke qetile ho botsa.
Some people believe that such people should be arrested.	Batho ba bang ba lumela hore batho ba joalo ba lokela ho tšoaroa.
It was so.	Ho bile joalo.
In fact, they decided.	Ntho ea sebele, ba ile ba etsa qeto.
I can't find it.	Ha ke fumane.
He could not finish the job.	O ne a sa khone ho qeta mosebetsi oo.
What he said is true.	Seo a se buileng ke ’nete.
Otherwise, you will never know what it could be.	Ho seng joalo, u ke ke ua tseba hore na e ka ba eng.
So they don't know.	Kahoo ha ba tsebe.
Some of them do.	Ba bang ba bona ba etsa joalo.
He was good to me.	O ne a bile molemo ho nna.
But just look at this thing.	Empa sheba feela ntho ena.
That is strange to us.	Hore ke ntho e makatsang ho rona.
Lots of books.	Libuka tse ngata.
I am sure he will do well.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o tla etsa hantle.
Almost very good.	Hoo e ka bang hantle haholo.
He did a great job at that.	O entse mosebetsi o motle ho seo.
I've never been in a day.	Ha ke eso be ka letsatsi.
In the end, your letter was a good one.	Qetellong, lengolo la hau le ne le le monate haholo.
She was so beautiful.	O ne a le motle haholo.
They will play for hours.	Ba tla bapala lihora tse ngata.
Who we were.	Re ne re le mang.
One day.	Letsatsi le le leng.
Sometimes it really is.	Ka linako tse ling ho hlile ho joalo.
You know now what you are.	O tseba jwale seo o leng sona.
There is no real reason.	Ha ho lebaka la sebele.
To be.	Ho ba.
I think he is a very close person to me.	Ke nahana hore ke motho ea haufi haholo le nna.
That's great.	Ke hantle haholo.
It’s one of my favorite things.	Ke e 'ngoe ea lintho tseo ke li ratang haholo.
They take days.	Li nka matsatsi.
If the site is difficult, this will help.	Haeba sebaka se le thata, sena se tla thusa.
I know him well.	Ke mo tseba hantle.
We are happy for our stay.	Re thabetse ho lula ha rona.
I a.	Ke a.
So we thought.	Kahoo re ile ra nahana.
I'm not sure there is anything else.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore ho na le se seng.
It must be.	E tlameha ebe .
There is no legal question.	Ha ho potso ea molao.
You don't have to, you know.	Ha o a tlameha, le a tseba.
Do that once again.	Ho etsa seo hang hape.
'e na'.	'e na'.
Amazing.	E makatsang.
It's hard to say.	Ho thata ho bua.
He went to the bedroom and opened the door.	O ile a ea kamoreng 'me a bula lemati.
I will never be here again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke e-ba mona.
But it is not of every kind.	Empa ha se ea mofuta o mong le o mong.
I don't want to know anything about them.	Ha ke batle ho tseba letho ka bona.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
So think about that.	Kahoo nahana ka seo.
I don’t care who thinks first.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na ke mang ea nahanang pele.
But that is for another day.	Empa seo ke sa letsatsi le leng hape.
He became a teacher.	E ile ea e-ba tichere.
I really want this more than anything.	Ke hlile ke batla sena ho feta eng kapa eng.
I don't even know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe le hore na ke eng.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
This would happen soon.	Sena se ne se tla etsahala kapele.
And more.	Le ho feta.
If he says he hasn't meant it yet.	Haeba a re ha e-so be o bolela.
And she has a name.	Mme o na le lebitso.
No one near you.	Haho ya haufi le wena.
I think he will never be able to trust people as much as before.	Ke nahana hore a ke ke a khona ho tšepa batho joaloka pele.
Police found his weapon in the area.	Mapolesa a ile a fumana sebetsa sa hae sebakeng seo.
Maybe when you arrive, we will know more.	Mohlomong ha u fihla, re tla be re tseba haholoanyane.
And that.	Mme le hore.
Through our friends.	Ka metsoalle ea rona.
I was getting to know him better.	Ke ne ke qala ho mo tseba hantle.
You never see it again.	Ha u sa e bona hape.
Not good so far.	Ha e ntle ho fihlela joale.
A group of children were playing nearby.	Sehlopha sa bana se ne se bapala haufi le moo.
It is now.	Ke hona joale.
I can't do it alone.	Ha ke khone ho e etsa ke le mong.
I had no idea.	Ke ne ke sa nahane.
It did, but only a little.	E entse, empa hanyane feela.
What we do.	Re etsang.
Be aware of your feelings.	Hlokomela maikutlo a hao.
To sleep at night, to sleep at night.	Ho robala bosiu, robala bosiu.
That's the way it happens here.	Ke kamoo e etsahalang mona.
It's just dangerous.	Ke kotsi feela.
I hope you will be back soon !.	Kea tšepa u tla khutla hangata!.
It does not think.	Ha e nahane.
It was almost inadequate.	E ne e batla e sa lekana.
You do not know until you try.	Ha o tsebe ho fihlela o leka.
I received a lot of help.	Ke ile ka fumana thuso e ngata.
You are the one who is not.	Ke uena ea seng joalo.
I had an idea.	Ke ile ka ba le mohopolo.
He knows the area well.	O tseba sebaka seo hantle.
You can't be second.	Le ke ke la ba bobeli.
But it is such a simple thing.	Empa ke ntho e bonolo hakana.
Something can happen at once.	Ntho e ka etsahala hang.
I am trying to write this book.	Ke leka ho ngola buka ena.
You work when you want.	U sebetsa ha u batla.
This is a great opportunity.	Sena ke monyetla o moholo.
They never met again.	Ha ba ka ba hlola ba kopana hape.
He called to talk to me.	O ile a letsetsa ho bua le 'na.
It's too long.	E telele haholo.
And indeed, it did.	'Me ka sebele, e entse joalo.
It is best not to see them often.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua ba bona hangata.
It was just me.	E ne e le 'na feela.
It's very simple.	E bonolo haholo.
So we will have it.	Kahoo re tla ba le eona.
Some of us have never done that before.	Ba bang ba rona ha ho mohla re kileng ra etsa joalo.
He arrived just as they were eating.	A fihla ha ba qeta ho ja.
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le joalo.
It is better that you go without us.	Ho molemo hore u tsamaee ntle le rona.
You may want to read about it.	U ka 'na ua batla ho bala ka eona.
I know it's not very fun.	Kea tseba hore ha e monate haholo.
It will do so.	E tla etsa joalo.
No one knew what to do.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tseba hore na a etse eng.
He continues to do so.	O ntse a tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
What do they know ?.	Ba tseba eng?.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
Each one will be good at times and sometimes bad.	E 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e tla ba e ntle ka linako tse ling 'me ka linako tse ling e be mpe.
I love watching you play.	Ke rata ho o shebella o bapala.
He has a job.	O na le mosebetsi.
He doesn't even have to think about it.	Ha aa lokela le ho e nahana.
You can take any money you want.	U ka nka chelete efe kapa efe eo u e batlang.
Use what you have.	Sebelisa seo u nang le sona.
But he is not one of that type, he is not.	Empa ha se e mong oa mofuta oo, ha a joalo.
I love you, you know that.	Kea o rata, o tseba seo.
They will never forget that.	Ba ke ke ba lebala seo.
They eat nothing.	Ha ba je letho.
Who knew what Mom was like.	Ke mang ea neng a tseba hore na 'Mè o joang.
I was not thinking of anything else.	Ke ne ke sa nahane letho le leng.
They are about to enter.	Ba se ba tla kena.
It's behind me now.	Ke ka morao ho nna jwale.
Try something else.	Leka se seng.
There may be people like that today.	Ho ka 'na ha e-ba le batho ba tšoanang le bona kajeno.
It had been a long time since he had slept.	E ne e se e le nako e telele esale a robala.
We are not very good here.	Ha re hantle haholo mona.
Before that, the teacher.	Pele ho moo, tichere.
Sometimes that happens.	Ka linako tse ling seo sea etsahala.
I could not walk.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho tsamaea.
And we will do that.	Mme re tla etsa seo.
Anyway, thank you.	Leha ho le joalo, kea leboha.
That's very true.	Ho joalo haholo.
But just think.	Empa nahana feela.
Walking can take the place of walking.	Ho tsamaea ho ka nka sebaka sa ho tsamaea.
There are so many.	Ho na le tse ngata haholo.
I can't do it.	Ha ke khone ho e etsa.
So he was an only child.	Kahoo e ne e le ngoana a le mong.
It was the same with us.	Ho bile joalo le ka rōna.
Or that is how it felt.	Kapa ke kamoo e neng e ikutloa kateng.
I would love to hear your thoughts.	Nka thabela ho utloa maikutlo a hau.
Just make sense.	Etsa kelello feela.
I hope they did something about it.	Ke tšepa ba entse ho hong ka eona.
We must take our place.	Re tlameha ho nka sebaka sa rona.
And of course, they are very good.	'Me ka sebele, li ntle haholo.
Yes, we eat a lot of food.	E, re ja lijo tse ngata haholo.
So he ate breakfast again.	Kahoo a ja lijo tsa hoseng hape.
My thing is money.	Ntho ea ka ke chelete.
While they worked hard, the family always came first for them.	Ha ba ntse ba sebetsa ka thata, kamehla lelapa le ne le tla pele bakeng sa bona.
Everyone needs to hear it once.	E mong le e mong o hloka ho e utloa hang.
They have nothing, they want something.	Ba se nang letho, ba batla ho hong.
Everyone else knows them.	Ba bang bohle ba a ba tseba.
You can't let it go.	U ke ke ua e tlohela.
It was early in the morning.	E ne e sa le hoseng.
He wondered if he had finally met the woman.	A ipotsa hore na ebe qetellong o kopane le mosali.
You can stay as long as you like.	U ka lula nako e telele kamoo u ratang.
He looked ahead, not speaking.	A sheba ka pele, a sa bue.
He had an amazing sense of humor.	O ne a e-na le mokhoa o makatsang oa ho tseba lintho.
And we knew what we had to do.	Mme re ne re tseba seo re neng re lokela ho se etsa.
This was the first time.	Sena e bile sa pele.
We just do our job.	Re etsa mosebetsi oa rona feela.
So we don't meet people.	Kahoo ha re kopane le batho.
He did this in a very strange way.	O entse sena ka tsela e makatsang haholo.
Yet this was longer than most.	Leha ho le joalo ena e ne e le nako e telele ho feta ba bangata.
I kept thinking that tomorrow would be better.	Ke ne ke ntse ke nahana hore hosane ho tla ba betere.
But you did this to me.	Empa u entse sena ho 'na.
He never rejected anyone.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a hana motho.
However, by then it was too late.	Leha ho le joalo, ka nako eo e ne e se e le morao haholo.
It's a lot better than the previous one.	E batla e le betere ho feta e fetileng.
But there were not many.	Empa ho ne ho se na tse ngata.
We made friends that way for several years.	Re ile ra lula metsoalle ka tsela eo ka lilemo tse ’maloa.
You need to work on the last issue.	O hloka ho sebetsa taba ea ho qetela.
Are you happy with your life?	A na u thabile ka bophelo ba hao?
We'll see if that works.	Re tla bona hore na seo sea sebetsa.
I was there too.	Ke ne ke bile moo le 'na.
However, I believe that everything must mean something.	Leha ho le joalo, ke lumela hore ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e tlameha ho bolela ho hong.
It did not take long.	Ha ea ka ea nka nako e telele.
Sometimes I think so.	Ka linako tse ling ke nahana joalo.
I will only tell the truth to you.	Ke tla bua 'nete feela ho uena.
It's useless.	Ha e na thuso.
Ask for help from family and friends.	Kopa thuso ho ba lelapa le metsoalle.
No problem there.	Haho bothata moo.
Perhaps they would be able to do this.	Mohlomong ba ne ba tla khona ho etsa sena.
But it was not really gone.	Empa ha e le hantle e ne e sa tloha.
And you should know mine.	'Me u lokela ho tseba ea ka.
Which is very close.	E leng e haufi haholo.
Even that name he did not know.	Le lebitso leo o ne a sa le tsebe.
Well, maybe we are.	Be, mohlomong re joalo.
Except that is not the case.	Ntle le hore ha ho joalo.
I'm better now.	Ke betere jwale.
She started telling him about her son.	A qala ho mo bolella ka mora wa hae.
The phone rang and he picked it up.	Mohala o ile oa lla eaba oa o nka.
I loved sleeping with her.	Ke ne ke rata ho robala le eena.
How long from any of them.	Nako e kae ho tloha leha e le ofe oa bona.
The important thing is that you can learn something else today.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore u ka ithuta ho hong hape kajeno.
He did not think why he was looking for her.	O ne a sa nahane hore na ke hobane'ng ha a mo batla.
Here, he would have books.	Mona, o ne a tla ba le libuka.
Something wonderful was happening.	Ho ne ho etsahala ntho e makatsang.
The man stared at it long and carefully.	Monna eo o ile a sheba nako e telele le ka hloko.
I did not realize.	Ha kea ka ka hlokomela.
They had a problem, too.	Ba bile le bothata, le bona.
Use less, use more.	Sebelisa hanyane, sebelisa hape ho feta.
I have to look at it that way.	Ke lokela ho e sheba ka tsela eo.
Please use the search method to find the content you are looking for.	Ka kopo sebelisa mokhoa oa ho batla ho fumana litaba tseo u li batlang.
He needed a weapon.	O ne a hloka sebetsa.
It's your fault.	Ke molato oa hao.
Maybe he would know something.	Mohlomong o ne a tla tseba ho hong.
Some people will love you for who you are.	Batho ba bang ba tla u rata bakeng sa hau.
I did not meet my father at this time.	Ke ne ke sa kopane le Ntate ka nako ena.
We could see how this was happening.	Re ne re bona tsela eo sena se etsahalang ka eona.
The boy has taken everything he ever had.	Moshanyana o nkile tsohle tseo a kileng a ba le tsona.
That should help.	Seo se lokela ho thusa.
I was just beginning to hear about them.	Ke ne ke qala ho utloa ka tsona.
Look at his feet.	Sheba maoto a hae.
I know it in me.	Ke e tseba ka ho nna.
I want it to be weird.	Ke batla hore e be ntho e makatsang.
They continued to live as one group.	Ba ile ba tsoela pele ho phela joaloka sehlopha se le seng.
I can keep trying to do it.	Nka tsoela pele ho leka ho e etsa.
I can only do it when needed.	Ke khona ho e etsa feela ha ho hlokahala.
Start with a few things.	Qala ka lintho tse seng kae.
It is easy to do now.	Ho bonolo hoo u ka e etsang hona joale.
And just to reach this conclusion.	Mme ho fihlela qeto ena feela.
I can't do much.	Ha ke khone ho etsa tse ngata.
However, it does not seem to be doing this.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e bonahale e etsa sena.
It is better to get a letter, instead.	Ho molemo ho fumana lengolo, ho e-na le hoo.
Because you are not.	Hobane ha u joalo.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
Not much, but we love it.	Ha e ngata, empa rea ​​e rata.
I'm done but I have a problem like this.	Ke qetile empa ke na le bothata bo kang bona.
If we did that, there would be no reason for life.	Haeba re ne re ka etsa joalo ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba le lebaka la ho phela.
They can't understand these things.	Ha ba khone ho utloisisa lintho tsena.
I could not buy what he said.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho reka seo a se buileng.
They stood up and spoke.	Ba ile ba ema ’me ba bua.
I don't believe there is anyone like him.	Ha ke lumele hore ho na le motho ea tšoanang le eena.
She enjoyed being with him.	O ne a thabela ho ba le eena.
I'm sorry about all this, you know.	Ke masoabi ka tsena tsohle, ua tseba.
We've seen this really happen.	Re bone sena se hlile se etsahala.
They can have fun times.	Ba ka ba le linako tse monate.
I know he doesn't want a family.	Kea tseba ha a so batle lelapa.
I mean we do, but we don't.	Ke bolela hore rea etsa, empa ha re etse joalo.
It is too late.	E se e le morao haholo.
It was something we did.	E ne e le ntho eo re e entseng.
Yes, that's his real name too.	E, ke lebitso la hae la 'nete hape.
So keep holding on.	Kahoo tsoela pele ho tšoara.
Riding clothes, too.	Liaparo tsa ho palama, hape.
Was he expecting?	Na o ne a lebeletse?
We love what we do.	Re rata seo re se etsang.
Or his parents.	Kapa batsoali ba hae.
I have things to do.	Ke na le lintho tseo ke lokelang ho li etsa.
Getting to work today was not easy.	Ho fihla mosebetsing kajeno ho ne ho se bonolo.
Now this goes beyond the personal opinion.	Hona joale sena se feta maikutlo a motho ka mong.
Why is this happening?	Ke hobane'ng ha see se etsahala?
But this, too, in my opinion is a good thing.	Empa sena, le sona, ka maikutlo a ka ke ntho e ntle.
Plan to do it again next year.	Rera ho e etsa hape selemong se tlang.
Lots, lots, lots.	Tse ngata, tse ngata, tse ngata.
Do all you can with everything.	Etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang ka tsohle.
I will really want that.	Ke tla batla seo haholo.
Grab it! 	Tšoara!
I love all of that, too.	Ke rata tseo tsohle, le nna.
So you have kids who have a lot of money.	Kahoo u na le bana ba nang le chelete e ngata.
You had it all the way.	U ne u e-na le tsela eohle.
The young man looked at the picture.	Mohlankana o ile a sheba setšoantšo seo.
It was like a betrayal.	E ne eka ke ho eka.
It really had it all.	E ne e hlile e na le tsohle.
And tell her you will help her.	'Me u mo bolelle hore u tla mo thusa.
I do not know if it is enough.	Ha ke tsebe hore e lekana.
So it was something new in this area.	Kahoo e ne e le ntho e ncha sebakeng sena.
They knew what my son was doing.	Ba ne ba tseba seo mora oa ka a se etsang.
These are good things.	Tsena ke lintho tse ntle.
That would be great fun.	Hoo ho ka ba monate haholo.
We had never seen anything like it before.	Re ne re e-s’o bone ntho e tšoanang le eona.
It seemed more important.	E ne e bonahala e le bohlokoa haholoanyane.
It just says yes.	E re feela e.
Both of them donated water.	Bobeli ba bona ba ile ba fana ka metsi.
She seemed happy.	O ne a bonahala a thabile.
We will continue.	Re tla tsoela pele.
We wish it had worked.	Re lakatsa eka e ka be e ile ea sebetsa.
Problems were in the classroom.	Mathata a ne a le ka phaposing.
This gives you the best.	Sena se u fa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
I need help with this.	Ke kopa thuso ka sena.
He had found it, too.	O ne a e fumane, le eena.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
I actually met him through his father.	Ka sebele ke ile ka kopana le eena ka ntate oa hae.
They can live without money.	Ba ka phela ntle le chelete.
I feel like there is not enough news.	Ke utloa eka ha ho na litaba tse lekaneng.
So, I do not know what to do.	Kahoo, ha ke tsebe hore na ke etse eng.
They do not seem to take this issue of sleep.	Ha ho bonahale ba nka taba ena ea ho robala.
I get a good idea.	Ke fumana mohopolo o le motle.
And he knew it was me, too.	Mme o ne a tseba hore e ne e le nna, le nna.
But he is not the best.	Empa ha se eena ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
It will help them with their lives.	E tla ba thusa ka bophelo ba bona.
I doubted that.	Ke ne ke belaela seo.
Drink water more often.	Noa metsi hangata le ho feta.
Look at this question.	Sheba potso ena.
I do not know yet.	ha ke so tsebe.
It takes a lot of time to finish.	Ho hlokahala nako e ngata ho qeta.
However, no one did.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho ea e entseng.
However, he said more than he should have said.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a bua ho feta kamoo a neng a lokela ho bua kateng.
We are no longer helping you.	Ha re sa hlola re u thusa.
And his hands.	Le matsoho a hae.
My mother had to buy a lot of food.	'Mè o ile a tlameha ho reka lijo tse ngata.
It has to be tough.	E lokela ho ba thata.
Thanks for watching.	Kea leboha ka ho shebella.
I did something you didn't want to do.	Ke entse ntho eo o neng o sa e batle.
He left quickly.	O ile a tsamaea kapele.
I don't know why a guy would say that.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha mohlankana a ka bua joalo.
That's what it is.	Ke eona taba eo.
You may enjoy it but still learn about it.	U ka e thabela empa u ntse u ithuta ka eona.
He wants a family.	O batla lelapa.
He still needs money for everything.	O ntse a hloka chelete bakeng sa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
I had food and water.	Ke ne ke na le lijo le metsi.
They want to know what we do.	Ba batla ho tseba seo re se etsang.
It was not good.	E ne e se ntle.
The woman could not walk.	Mosali eo o ne a sitoa ho tsamaea.
And that is exactly what we wanted.	'Me ke sona seo re neng re se batla.
I mean you can.	Ke bolela hore u ka khona.
I just knew.	Ke ne ke tseba feela.
He knew he would never win.	O ne a tseba hore a ke ke a hlola.
We are here, and we will stay here.	Re mona, 'me re tla lula mona.
We need to have both.	Re hloka ho ba le bobeli.
There is nothing to be afraid of.	Ha ho letho leo u lokelang ho le tšaba.
We must go hand in hand.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea ka matsoho.
If only he had a lifetime like ours.	Hoja e ne e e-na le nako ea bophelo joaloka ea rōna.
This is probably the first one.	Mohlomong ena ke ea pele.
Also, he asked about the job.	Hape, o ile a botsa ka mosebetsi.
Hard as it is, keep going.	Leha ho le thata, tsoela pele.
It will definitely give you a chance.	Ka sebele e tla u fa monyetla.
It's not my place.	Ha se sebaka sa ka.
They remained friends for decades.	Ba ile ba lula e le metsoalle ka lilemo tse mashome.
We were not sure where we were.	Re ne re sa tsebe hantle hore na re hokae.
Then he suggested a way out.	Joale o ile a etsa tlhahiso ea tsela ea ho tsoa.
I said so.	Ke itse ho jwalo.
She spends most of her time on her hair.	O qeta nako e ngata moriri oa hae.
He does not eat much.	Ha a je haholo.
He once lived here, but he never lived again.	O kile a phela mona, empa ha a sa hlola a phela.
And maybe he was there.	Mme mohlomong o ne a le teng.
I can not say that you were there too.	Ha ke khone ho bolela hore le uena u ne u le teng.
But night was his favorite time.	Empa bosiu e ne e le nako eo a e ratang haholo.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
I have had my life again.	Ke bile le bophelo ba ka hape.
If you do not know.	Haeba ha o tsebe.
Or a man.	Kapa monna.
He knew what he had done.	O ne a tseba seo a se entseng.
I just want it.	Ke e batla feela.
Maybe he's waiting for it.	Mohlomong o ntse a e emetse.
We need both.	Re li hloka ka bobeli.
Too much perhaps.	E ngata haholo mohlomong.
He may have something important to say.	A ka ’na a ba le ntho ea bohlokoa eo a batlang ho e bua.
It's just.	Ke feela.
But it is still fun.	Empa ho ntse ho le monate.
I have to know who did this.	Ke tlameha ho tseba hore na ke mang ea entseng sena.
We don't get that anymore.	Ha re sa fumana seo.
I should be done by now.	Ke lokela hore ebe ke qetile hona joale.
You do not want them here.	Ha o ba batle mona.
I know you don't care about money.	Kea tseba hore ha o tsotelle chelete.
I want to talk to her mother.	Ke batla ho bua le mme wa hae.
These things do not seem to be harmful to me.	Lintho tsena ha li bonahale li le kotsi ho 'na.
I needed to get home and make dinner.	Ke ne ke hloka ho fihla hae ’me ke etse lijo tsa mantsiboea.
You need to regain strength.	O hloka ho fumana matla hape.
I was a child, and no one told me anything.	Ke ne ke sa le ngoana, ho se motho ea ileng a mpolella letho.
If so, he would take it.	Haeba ho joalo, o ne a tla e nka.
Some hours from there.	Lihora tse ling ho tloha moo.
Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's not good.	Ka nako e 'ngoe e ntle, ka linako tse ling ha e ntle.
If they do, it is better for you.	Haeba ba etsa joalo, ho molemo ho uena.
I just love how good real food is.	Ke rata feela kamoo lijo tsa 'nete li leng ntle kateng.
We are not doing this right now.	Ha re etse sena hona joale.
Le.	Le.
Same thing in another way.	Ntho e tšoanang ka tsela e 'ngoe.
We have beautiful children.	Re na le bana ba batle.
This was his last night.	Bona e bile bosiu ba hae ba ho qetela.
So yes, that's where you have it.	Kahoo ee, ke moo u nang le eona.
Things were good.	Lintho li ne li le ntle.
He knew better.	O ne a tseba ho feta.
Make them special by making them strong.	Etsa hore li be tsa bohlokoa ka ho li etsa hore li be matla.
He does.	O etsa jwalo.
More than enough of course.	Ho feta ho lekaneng ha e le hantle.
Everyone was happy.	Bohle ba ne ba thabile.
However, it is easy to see what is at stake.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bonolo ho bona se kotsing.
This would only take a few hours to repair.	Sena se ne se tla nka lihora tse seng kae feela ho lokisa.
Probably too powerful.	Mohlomong e matla haholo.
My name.	Lebitso la ka.
However, he did not give up.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a ka a e tlohela.
These are good books.	Tsena ke libuka tse molemo.
I saw you come in this morning.	Ke u bone u kena hoseng hona hoseng hona.
He said they would do so.	O itse ba tla etsa joalo.
It seemed like a very serious problem.	Ho ile ha bonahala e le bothata bo boima haholo.
Love your daily news!	Ho rata litaba tsa hau tsa letsatsi le letsatsi!
He looked at his dog.	A sheba ntja ya hae.
It was hard to refuse.	Ho ne ho le thata ho hana.
Something was here that he had never seen before.	Ntho e teng mona eo a neng a qala ho e bona.
It was very early in the morning.	E ne e le hoseng haholo.
She cried.	O ile a lla.
We are one of the last.	Re ba bang ba ho qetela.
And there were others, of course.	Mme ho ne ho na le ba bang, ehlile.
One person must come out.	Motho a le mong o tlameha ho tsoa.
He knew them well.	O ne a tseba hantle le bona.
I went home and told Dad.	Ke ile ka ea hae ’me ka bolella Ntate.
That was very bad news.	Eo e ne e le litaba tse mpe haholo.
I heard a lot.	Ke utloile haholo.
This may have been true.	Sena e ka 'na eaba e ne e le 'nete.
If only they could.	Haeba feela ba ka khona.
He didn't have it.	O ne a se na eona.
Some of them, though.	Ba bang ba bona, leha ho le joalo.
Get well with your children.	Eba le bana ba hao hantle.
It has always been a tool.	Haesale e le sebetsa.
Travel is easy.	Ho tsamaea ho bonolo.
They did not hear her cry at night anymore.	Ha baa ka ba hlola ba mo utloa a lla bosiu.
You just know them.	U ba tseba feela.
He has always been a thoughtful person.	Haesale e le motho ea ratang ho nahana.
I'm so glad to see you again.	Ke thabile haholo ho o bona hape.
He was happy.	O ne a thabile.
For all.	Bakeng sa tsohle.
I just couldn’t because of that accident.	Ke ile ka sitoa feela ka lebaka la kotsi eo.
But he has to wait.	Empa o lokela ho ema.
I'm talking.	Ke ntse ke bua.
He seems unaware of the problem.	Ho bonahala a sa tsebe letho ka bothata boo.
These things are important to our lives.	Lintho tsena li bohlokoa bakeng sa ho phela ha rōna.
He was important, but he did not know her very well.	O ne a le bohlokoa, empa o ne a sa mo tsebe hakaalo.
We will work on them.	Re tla sebetsa ho tsona.
Everyone was doing bad things.	Batho bohle ba ne ba etsa lintho tse mpe.
So he stayed there for a while.	Kahoo o ile a lula moo nako e itseng.
Just something.	Ntho feela.
He has several others.	O na le ba bang ba 'maloa.
I will not be those things.	Ha ke na ho ba lintho tseo.
He could not think straight.	O ne a sitoa ho nahana hantle.
We will be back soon.	Re tla tla ho thusa haufinyane.
Thanks for watching and drinking delicious !.	Kea leboha ka ho sheba le ho noa monate!.
We want the past, or we wish for what we do not have.	Re batla se fetileng, kapa re lakatsa seo re se nang sona.
Not at all the case here.	Ho hang ha ho joalo mona.
Of course, there are some problems here.	Ehlile, ho na le mathata a mang mona.
Maybe we'll talk to them someday.	Mohlomong re tla bua le bona ka letsatsi le leng.
That's how we do it.	Ke kamoo re e etsang kateng.
When you finish this, it will be night.	Ha o qeta sena, e tla be e le bosiu.
Our team will take care of you.	Sehlopha sa rona se tla o hlokomela.
Often, we think we know something.	Hangata, re nka hore re tseba ho hong.
That is a very difficult task.	Ke mosebetsi o boima haholo oo.
I can see what is happening around her.	Ke bona se etsahalang haufi le eena.
Ask in advance.	Botsa esale pele.
They thought he would do, well, what he did.	Ba ne ba nahana hore o tla etsa, hantle, seo o se entseng.
You do not know why it might work but it does not.	Ha u tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha e ka sebetsa empa ha ho joalo.
He could not walk and work hard.	O ne a sitoa ho tsamaea le ho sebetsa ka thata.
I know what they did.	Ke tseba seo ba se entseng.
I certainly made that decision.	Ka sebele ke ile ka etsa qeto eo.
It was everything.	E ne e le ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
Assume it to be so.	Nka hore ho joalo.
It starts soon.	E qala haufinyane.
You will probably have trouble sleeping tonight,	Mohlomong u tla ba le bothata ba ho robala bosiung bona,
You can still go back.	U ntse u ka khutlela morao.
He took a long coffee.	O ile a nka kofi e telele.
I'll tell you when.	Ke tla u bolella neng.
I wanted many things at once.	Ke ne ke batla lintho tse ngata ka nako e le 'ngoe.
He had to ask, he knew it.	O ne a lokela ho botsa, o ne a e tseba.
They do not know exactly what is going on.	Ha ba tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahalang.
It was their last chance.	E ne e le monyetla oa bona oa ho qetela.
I do not fully understand why this is so.	Ha ke utloisise hantle hore na hobaneng ho le joalo.
Then the truth began.	Eaba 'nete ea qala.
Yes of course.	Ehlile ho joalo.
There are hard days.	Ho na le matsatsi a thata.
As a group, we work with other people.	Re le sehlopha, re sebetsa le batho ba bang.
My father has been working there every day since then.	Ntate esale a sebetsa moo letsatsi le leng le le leng ho tloha ka nako eo.
This is something that is not easy to have.	Ena ke ntho eo ho seng bonolo ho ba le eona.
Go on with life.	Tsoela pele ka bophelo.
My mother was there.	Mme wa ka o ne a le teng.
That is giving.	Hoo ke ho fana.
And you too will be here.	Mme le wena o tla be o le teng mona.
He did not want me to tell you.	O ne a sa batle hore ke o bolelle.
But he knew what he needed to do.	Empa o ne a tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
There is no such thing as a good book.	Ha ho letho le kang buka e ntle.
I know my husband.	Ke tseba monna oa ka.
Of course, you will not be able to fix this issue.	Ha e le hantle, u ke ke ua khona ho lokisa taba ena.
This you will see.	Sena u tla se bona.
Maybe someone told them.	Mohlomong motho e mong o ile a ba bolella.
He was just beginning to see it.	O ne a qala ho e bona.
The doctor stopped talking.	Ngaka ha ea ka ea hlola e bua.
Here a higher meaning is better.	Mona ho bolela ho phahameng ho molemo.
Stay tuned.	Lula ka monyetla.
Second power, perhaps.	Matla a bobeli, mohlomong.
I slept there for a while.	Ke ile ka robala moo nako e itseng.
They seemed happy.	Ba ne ba bonahala ba thabile.
He was a doctor by profession.	E ne e le ngaka ka mosebetsi.
When they really live their lives, they are strong.	Ha ba hlile ba phela bophelo ba bona, ba matla.
It was just for me.	E ne e le ea ka feela.
But he was not.	Empa o ne a se joalo.
As for Dad, it was easy.	Ha e le Ntate, ho ne ho le bonolo.
Time is of the essence.	Nako e bohlokoa haholo.
I can't do everything today or this week.	Ha ke khone ho etsa tsohle kajeno kapa bekeng ena.
You know, and the girl.	Ua tseba, le ngoanana.
However, it is a good place to try.	Leha ho le joalo, ke sebaka se setle sa ho leka.
Anyway, we were just a few.	Ho ne ho le joang, re ne re le ba 'maloa feela.
He was walking.	O ne a ntse a tsamaea.
They could not help us.	Ba ne ba sitoa ho re thusa.
Giving him what he wants.	Ho mo fa seo a se batlang.
One day, that was all he needed.	Ka letsatsi le leng hape, ke sona feela seo a neng a se hloka.
You have to see and feel.	O tlameha ho bona le ho ikutloa.
It was a beautiful room.	E ne e le kamore e ntle.
I just get it.	Ke fumana feela.
You don't like that.	Ha o rate seo.
Perhaps he should not have treated her so harshly.	Mohlomong ha aa lokela ho mo tšoara ka thata hakaalo.
Sometime, now.	Ka nako e 'ngoe, joale.
However, they did a very good job.	Leha ho le joalo, ba entse mosebetsi o motle haholo.
The question is whether we can trust it.	Potso ke hore na re ka e tšepa.
There is nothing else in it.	Ha ho letho le leng ho eona.
It was so.	Ho ne ho le jwalo.
They looked good together.	Ba ne ba shebahala hantle hammoho.
It was good.	E ne e le molemo.
But he certainly would do so.	Empa ehlile o ne a tla etsa joalo.
Finally we left.	Qetellong re ile ra tsamaea.
I did not know.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe.
I have never seen anything like it.	Ha ke eso bone ntho e kang eo.
She is so beautiful.	O motle ruri.
He got the first one.	O ile a fumana ea pele.
This may be easier for some people than for others.	Sena se ka ba bonolo ho batho ba bang ho feta ba bang.
In fact, he did very well with me.	Ha e le hantle, o entse hantle haholo ka nna.
He wants to know you.	O batla ho o tseba.
No, they could not make him see why.	Che, ba ne ba sa khone ho etsa hore a bone lebaka.
The name does not matter.	Lebitso ha le bohlokoa.
Just for you.	Bakeng sa hau feela.
However, we are still getting a lot of them.	Leha ho le joalo, re ntse re fumana tse ngata tsa tsona.
Are you sure you can't tell her.	Na u na le bonnete ba hore u ke ke ua mo bolella.
I believe things happen for a reason.	Ke lumela hore lintho li etsahala ka lebaka.
Image of a woman.	Setšoantšo sa mosali.
He had finally done it.	Qetellong o ne a e entse.
I left him.	Ke ile ka mo tlohela.
I thought it was so delicious.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e monate haholo.
But he did, and it did.	Empa o ile a etsa, mme ho ile ha eba jwalo.
If you want to not go.	Haeba u batla ho se tsamaee.
He agrees to work hard.	O lumela ho sebetsa ka thata.
He will work very well.	O tla sebetsa hantle haholo.
Delicious human food.	Lijo tse monate tsa batho.
He would never go back to play.	O ne a ke ke a hlola a khutlela ho bapala.
At some point.	Ka nako e itseng.
I understand that, though.	Ke utloisisa seo, leha ho le joalo.
However, everyone has an opinion.	Leha ho le joalo, bohle ba na le maikutlo.
This was fun for both of them.	Ena e ne e le monate ho bona ka bobeli.
i don't want to do it.	ha ke batle ho e etsa.
Great job.	Mosebetsi o moholo.
Same as his.	E tšoanang le ea hae.
He would see.	O ne a tla bona.
I belong to her.	Ke ya hae.
He may ask questions.	A ka 'na a botsa lipotso.
I'll talk to the man soon.	Ke tla bua le monna haufinyane.
He was arrested last night.	O ile a tšoaroa bosiung bo fetileng.
I hope so.	Ke tšepa joalo.
I'm done.	Ke qetile.
Back to work.	Khutlela mosebetsing.
Of course, that is not the case.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho joalo.
I would love to hear them.	Nka thabela ho li utloa.
He was waiting for them.	O ne a ntse a ba emetse.
No one knew him.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo tseba.
They don't see.	Ha ba bone.
He loves his father.	O rata ntate oa hae.
You may need a long time, but you will get there.	U ka 'na ua hloka nako e telele, empa u tla fihla moo.
You can pay him.	U ka mo lefa.
We both win.	Ka bobeli rea hlola.
I took advantage of that.	Ke ile ka nka monyetla ka seo.
Well, some were simple.	Hantle, tse ling li ne li le bonolo.
I see them now.	Kea ba bona hona joale.
It would have been much easier that way.	Ho ka be ho bile bonolo haholo ka tsela eo.
But somehow it was too late.	Empa ka tsela e itseng e ne e se e le morao haholo.
I have to go fast.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea kapele.
That worked very well.	Seo se ile sa sebetsa haholo.
Some people think that it is a problem.	Batho ba bang ba nahana hore ke bothata.
I know he just does his job.	Kea tseba hore o etsa mosebetsi oa hae feela.
This was his story.	Ena e ne e le taba ea hae.
They both could hear it crying.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba e utloa e lla.
There are so many things you can love here.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo u ka li ratang mona.
To me it is a strange thing.	Ho nna ke ntho e makatsang.
So off he went.	Kahoo e ile ea tsamaea.
They live in our area.	Ba lula sebakeng sa rona.
I'm just tired.	Ke khathetse feela.
Because yes, that just happened.	Hobane e, seo se sa tsoa etsahala.
No, I'm just kidding.	Ha ha, kea bapala.
However, the woman continued to refuse.	Leha ho le joalo, mosali eo o ile a tsoela pele ho hana.
I can't take this.	Ha ke khone ho nka sena.
He knows why.	O tseba lebaka.
We benefit you.	Re u tsoela molemo.
I understand who you are.	Ke utloisisa seo u leng ho sona.
We have to do it.	Re tlameha ho e etsa.
This is the first situation.	Bona ke boemo ba pele.
And they got it.	'Me ba li fumane.
I would have to call him and call him.	Ke ne ke tla tlameha ho mo letsetsa le ho mo letsetsa.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
Now, then.	Joale, joale .
Then it was our turn.	Joale e ne e le nako ea rōna.
However, that is not the best idea.	Leha ho le joalo, eo ha se mohopolo o motle ka ho fetisisa.
I am single.	Ha ke na motho.
He seemed to be thinking about it.	O ne a bonahala a nahana ka eona.
Or mine, for that matter.	Kapa ea ka, bakeng sa taba eo.
And we must give up all that now.	Mme re lokela ho tlohela tseo tsohle jwale.
There were many more.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse ling tse ngata.
You know they are in it for the money.	Ua tseba hore ba ho eona bakeng sa chelete.
Eventually we will get to it.	Qetellong re tla fihla ho eona.
At some point.	Ka nako e itseng.
I would not say anything.	Ke ne ke sa tlo bua letho.
Every now and then.	Nako le nako.
He has lived here for many years.	E se e le lilemo tse ngata a lula mona.
We just want to learn it.	Re mpa re batla ho e ithuta.
I can't find anything wrong there.	Ha ke fumane se phoso moo.
He traveled there on business.	O ile a etela moo ka mosebetsi.
Or do something else that you have to write down.	Kapa u etse ntho e 'ngoe eo u lokelang ho e ngola.
All good things.	Lintho tsohle tse ntle.
They are yours.	Ke tsa hao.
Instead, they used to be friends with many things in common.	Ho e-na le hoo, e kile ea e-ba metsoalle e nang le lintho tse ngata tse tšoanang.
That is where we will live, he decided for us.	Ke hona moo re tla dula teng, o ile a re etsetsa qeto.
Many people want to help everyone.	Batho ba bangata ba batla ho thusa bohle.
He was a heavy man.	E ne e le monna ya boima.
I understood the idea.	Ke ile ka utloisisa mohopolo.
But skepticism helps.	Empa ho belaela hoa thusa.
We continue to make this festival bigger than ever.	Re tsoela pele ho etsa hore mokete ona o be moholo ho feta leha e le neng pele.
He called again, again.	A letsa hape, hape.
They did not care if the man loved them.	Ba ne ba sa tsotelle hore na monna eo oa ba rata.
If he walked too fast it would fall.	Haeba a ne a ka tsamaea kapele e ne e tla oa.
He never trusted her.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a mo tšepa.
He was the power.	E ne e le eena matla.
Now just write "end" here.	Jwale ngola feela "qetellong" mona.
But something unusual happened next.	Empa ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang haufinyane.
I still did not understand it.	Ke ne ke ntse ke sa e utloisise.
You can have some if you want them.	U ka ba le tse ling haeba u li batla.
Let me find it.	E re ke e fumane.
I think you love your husband.	Ke nahana hore u rata monna oa hau.
We don't get it back home at this time.	Ha re e fumana hape hae ka nako ena.
And that would be a good thing.	Mme seo e ka ba taba hantle.
They ask again.	Ba botsa hape.
The child was an only child.	Ngoana e ne e le ngoana a le mong.
I didn't have to sit there doing nothing.	Ke ne ke sa tlameha ho lula moo ke sa etse letho.
They did not want to read about us.	Ba ne ba sa batle ho bala ka rona.
To tell you.	Ho o bolella.
I'm crying now.	Kea lla joale.
Their lives are also important.	Bophelo ba bona le bona ke ba bohlokoa.
But he was not on time.	Empa o ne a se ka nako.
I understood them.	Ke ne ke li utloisisa.
Clearly, the man had nothing.	Ho hlakile hore monna eo o ne a se na letho.
The guy is really nice.	Mohlankana e motle ruri.
He wanted nothing.	O ne a sa batle letho.
They can't be.	Ba ke ke ba.
It can help if you need it.	E ka thusa haeba o e hloka.
If so, consider your work.	Haeba u entse joalo, nahana ka mosebetsi oa hau.
If you do, you are not.	Haeba u etsa joalo, ha u joalo.
But we obviously knew it was coming.	Empa ho hlakile hore re ne re tseba hore e tla tla.
This was something else.	Ena e ne e le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I got the idea.	Ke ile ka fumana mohopolo.
He has never done that before.	Ha a e-s'o etse joalo.
Of course, that is not the case.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho joalo.
I have to help.	Ke tlameha ho thusa.
I thought maybe he would come to do that.	Ke ne ke nahana hore mohlomong o tla tla ho etsa joalo.
I thought about that.	Ke ile ka nahana ka seo.
It's not very good.	Ha e ntle haholo.
They will tell you.	Ba tla o bolella.
In here.	Ka mona.
I will come out long, long.	Ke tla tsoa nako e telele, e telele.
The danger is very real.	Kotsi ke ea sebele haholo.
He is very close.	O haufi haholo.
It was the end of my working week.	E ne e le qetellong ea beke ea ka ea mosebetsi.
It will not be enough.	Ho ke ke ha lekana.
Just the first few.	Tse seng kae feela tsa pele.
He does not always do it.	Ha a e etse kamehla.
What makes people real?	Ke eng e etsang hore batho e be batho ba sebele?
While this is true, it is clearly wrong.	Le hoja sena e le ’nete, ho hlakile hore ke phoso.
That makes that name meaningful.	E etsang hore lebitso leo le be le kelello.
Keep going your own way, do your thing.	Tsoela pele ho tsamaea ka tsela ea hau, etsa ntho ea hau.
But he did not decide to go.	Empa ha aa ka a etsa qeto ea ho tsamaea.
My mind would just go away.	Kelello ea ka e ne e tla tloha feela.
Again, this is your decision.	Hape, ena ke qeto ea hau.
You can use it to see if something is true.	U ka e sebelisa ho bona hore na ntho e 'ngoe ke 'nete.
I can't tell you right now.	Ha ke khone ho o bolella hona joale.
All in good time.	Tsohle ka nako e ntle.
I see the importance of this.	Ke bona bohlokoa ba sena.
After your children? 	Ka mor'a bana ba hau?
for anything! 	bakeng sa eng kapa eng!
And after all.	'Me ka mor'a tsohle.
But not everything is as simple as it could be.	Empa tsohle ha li bonolo joalo ka ha ho ne ho ka ba joalo.
I did not have another man at the time.	Ke ne ke se na monna e mong ka nako eo.
They will do what they want.	Ba tla etsa seo ba se ratang.
It was very painful.	Ho ne ho le bohloko haholo.
I do not like anyone.	Ha ke rate motho.
They can be important.	Li ka ba tsa bohlokoa.
I want to know who made it.	Ke batla ho tseba hore na ke mang ea e entseng.
I can go there.	Nka ea moo.
Live with them.	Phela le bona.
It was my first real job, you know.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa ka oa pele oa sebele, ua tseba.
We are under arrest.	Rea tšoaroa.
This was not what he expected.	Sena e ne e se seo a neng a se lebeletse.
I want to make sure.	Ke batla ho etsa bonnete.
Here is the point.	Taba ke ena.
I see it now, it's as clear as the sun.	Ke e bona joale, e hlakile joalo ka letsatsi.
This, however, is what they did.	Sena, leha ho le joalo, ke seo ba se entseng.
Both after me now, it is no longer real.	Ka bobeli ka mor'a ka hona joale, ha e sa le ea sebele.
It was so.	Ho bile joalo.
I study at school.	Ke ithuta sekolong.
A long time ago.	Nako e telele e fetileng.
Mme.	Mme .
However, he did not know them.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa ba tsebe.
Also, her mother does.	Hape, 'mè oa hae o etsa joalo.
I would be happy to help you.	Nka thabela ho u thusa.
This method is not difficult.	Mokhoa ona ha o thata.
Maybe some good and some bad.	Mohlomong tse ling tse ntle le tse ling tse mpe.
The reason for this is obvious.	Lebaka la sena le hlakile.
I don’t know what the problem might be.	Ha ke tsebe hore na bothata e ka ba eng.
Knowing that you must.	Ho tseba hore o tlameha.
Save your energy.	Boloka matla a hau.
There is	Ho na le
Because your life is still there.	Hobane bophelo ba hau bo ntse bo le teng.
An important way remains.	Tsela ea bohlokoa e ntse e le teng.
Here were some good things.	Mona ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ntle.
You know, these things are fun.	Ua tseba, lintho tsena li monate.
There was nothing they wanted.	Ho ne ho se ba batlang.
He seems to be working hard to become stronger.	Ho bonahala eka o leka ka matla hore a be matla.
We thought he would come later, but he came first.	Re ne re nahana hore o tla tla ka morao, empa o ile a tla pele.
I'm in a lot of pain now.	Ke utloa bohloko haholo joale.
Boy or girl, the baby was mine.	Moshanyana kapa ngoanana, ngoana e ne e le oa ka.
Living with him was my job.	Ho lula le eena e ne e le mosebetsi oa ka.
Then you will look at him.	Ebe o tla mo sheba.
If you like.	Haeba u rata.
Mine did not.	Ea ka ha e ea etsa joalo.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
He entered the room.	A kena ka phaposing.
He did not see how it could be him.	E ne e sa bone hore na e ka ba eena joang.
It is what we need more than anything.	Ke seo re se hlokang ho feta eng kapa eng.
That's when they do.	Ke ha ba etsa joalo.
He knows the way.	O tseba tsela.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke tsebe hantle.
You can try it.	U ka e leka.
I'm sure you found it.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o e fumane.
They will do or refuse to do so.	Ba tla etsa kapa ba hana.
Water is essential for life.	Metsi a hlokahala bakeng sa bophelo.
But some did not understand what others were saying.	Empa ba bang ha baa ka ba utloisisa seo ba bang ba se buang.
He always knew what to say.	O ne a lula a tseba seo a lokelang ho se bua.
I could not tell what happened next.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho bolela se ileng sa etsahala ka mor’a moo.
Not one of them stood up.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ileng a ema.
Or they once were.	Kapa ho kile ha ba le.
They think it is the best thing for their child.	Ba nahana hore ke ntho e ntle ka ho fetisisa ho ngoana oa bona.
It was a wonderful night.	E ne e le bosiu bo monate haholo.
We have to work on them.	Re tlameha ho li sebetsa.
Read the book.	Bala buka ea.
This is not the time to hear anything.	Ena ha se nako ea ho utloa letho.
This house is very old.	Ntlo ena ke ea khale haholo.
The first time he ever saw her he took it.	Lekhetlo la pele leo a kileng a mo bona a le nka.
I like water.	Ke rata metsi.
She looked like she was going to cry.	O ne a shebahala eka o tla lla.
I do not know what will happen to me in the future.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ho tla etsahala'ng ka 'na nakong e tlang.
Either way.	Ka mokhoa o mong le o mong.
He needed his mind now.	O ne a hloka kelello ea hae joale.
The good news is that we are doing this for you.	Litaba tse monate ke hore re u etsetsa sena.
But then if it were easy, everyone would do it.	Empa joale haeba ho ne ho le bonolo, bohle ba ka be ba etsa joalo.
I would not say such a thing.	Ke ne nke ke ka bua ntho e kang eo.
I read it and loved it.	Ke ile ka e bala ’me ka e rata.
We can do better.	Re ka etsa betere.
His father lived here as a child.	Ntate oa hae o ne a lula mona e sa le ngoana.
Everyone else liked it.	Ba bang kaofela ba ne ba e rata.
I thought it was a good idea.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke mohopolo o motle.
Yet he does not.	Leha ho le joalo ha a etse joalo.
It was easy, fast, in and out.	E ne e le bonolo, kapele, ho kena le ho tsoa.
Nice to see you.	Ke thabetse ho o bona.
They arrived outside.	Ba fihla ka ntle.
I want to know how he feels about me.	Ke batla ho tseba hore na o ikutloa joang ka 'na.
More, than me.	Ho feta, ho feta nna.
Of course, it will take a lot of hard work.	Ehlile, ho tla hloka mosebetsi o boima.
School is not a crime.	Sekolo ha se molato.
Now there is none.	Hona joale ha ho na.
We were not sure how much he told you.	Re ne re sa tsebe hantle hore na o u boleletse tse kae.
This is not the first way.	Ena ha se tsela ea pele.
People have to do that.	Batho ba tlameha ho etsa joalo.
In fact, one of them is obvious.	Ha e le hantle, e 'ngoe ea tsona e bonahala.
But it is one of the hind legs.	Empa ke le leng la maoto a morao.
There was an error.	Ho bile le phoso.
Now look at that 'find' line.	Joale sheba mohala oo oa 'fumana'.
They did not expect to cry like that.	Ba ne ba sa lebella ho lla jwalo.
But that was not the case at all.	Empa ho ne ho se joalo ho hang.
They would talk to you about it.	Ba ne ba tla bua le uena ka eona.
I feel like a child.	Ke ikutloa joaloka ngoana.
It was him or us.	E ne e le eena kapa rona.
And look there.	Mme sheba moo .
But look at my baby.	Empa sheba ngoana oa ka.
That is the situation here.	Ke boemo ba mona.
He loved his style.	O ne a rata mokhoa oa hae.
It would not have been easy !.	Ho ne ho ka se be bonolo!.
I would appreciate any help.	Ke tla thabela thuso efe kapa efe.
That's good news.	Ke litaba tse monate.
We love coffee.	Re rata kofi.
He was a strange man and he knew it.	E ne e le motho ya makatsang mme a e tseba.
I have to be the first.	Ke tlameha ho ba oa pele.
Her hair stands on end.	Moriri oa hae oa ema qetellong.
But often that is not the case.	Empa hangata ha ho joalo.
You must see a doctor.	U tlameha ho bona ngaka.
That's what dad is.	Taba ke eona eo ntate.
There is no point in going out again.	Ha ho na thuso ea ho tsoela ka ntle hape.
They did not know what they wanted to be.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe tsela eo ba batlang ho ba ka eona.
It is the past of many things.	Ke nako e fetileng ea lintho tse ngata.
That is not a crime.	Taba eo ha se molato.
He did not want it or even ask for it.	O ne a sa e batla kapa hona ho e kopa.
I just mean.	Ke bolela feela.
We will live longer.	Re tla phela ho feta.
Ask about them.	Botsa ka tsona.
Traveling was fun after that.	Ho tsamaea ho ne ho le monate ka mor'a moo.
And so it is with the very best.	'Me ho joalo le ka e ntle haholo.
Suffice it to say, in the end.	Ho lekana hantle, qetellong.
I loved what he did.	Ke ne ke rata seo a se entseng.
And there is nothing wrong with them.	'Me ho hang ha ho letho le phoso ka tsona.
It has always been a family.	Haesale e le lelapa.
If so, do nothing.	Haeba ho joalo, u se ke ua etsa letho.
No one else is coming.	Ha ho motho e mong ea tla.
Anything else makes no sense.	Ntho efe kapa efe e 'ngoe ha e na kelello.
Finally.	Qetellong.
Then you can get anything.	Joale u ka fumana eng kapa eng.
I wish he could be there.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka be a le teng.
That's where you want to be.	Ke hona moo o batlang ho ba teng.
Just pain.	Feela bohloko.
Others do not care.	Ba bang bona ha ba e tsotelle.
That's all they have to do.	Ke ntho feela eo ba lokelang ho e etsa.
I think most people can.	Ke nahana hore batho ba bangata ba ka khona.
Behind the question was a request for comment.	Ka morao ho potso e ne e le kopo ea maikutlo.
So it is very true.	Kahoo ke 'nete haholo.
I had to find it.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho e fumana.
He had to say something.	O ne a lokela ho bua ho hong.
I don't have to drive.	Ha kea tlameha ho khanna.
They will ask you a few questions.	Ba tla u botsa lipotso tse seng kae.
It was as if he had never heard anything.	E ne eka ha ho letho leo a kileng a le utloa.
I didn't want to do any of those things.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho etsa e 'ngoe ea lintho tseo.
This is it.	Ena ke eona.
They are still close friends to this day.	E ntse e le metsoalle e haufi ho fihlela kajeno.
You made such a beautiful picture.	U entse setšoantšo se setle joalo.
Sometimes it hurts.	Ka linako tse ling bohloko.
Everyone was busy.	Batho bohle ba ne ba phathahane.
And children.	Le bana.
He just fell asleep.	O ile a robala feela.
Also, the task is often even more difficult.	Hape, hangata mosebetsi o boima le ho feta.
He could not continue his work.	O ne a sitoa ho tsoela pele ka mosebetsi oa hae.
And there is nothing you can do about it.	'Me ha ho letho leo u ka le etsang ka eona.
That's bad news.	Ke litaba tse mpe tseo.
I looked good.	Ke ne ke shebahala hantle.
If you want to do that, well.	Haeba u batla ho etsa joalo, hantle.
He had time to do it.	O ne a e-na le nako ea ho e etsa.
That was close.	Seo se ne se le haufi.
Stupid mistake.	Phoso e hlokang kelello.
This is my decision.	Ena ke qeto ea ka.
They should help.	Ba lokela ho thusa.
I think you really want something here.	Ke nahana hore u hlile u batla ho hong mona.
It was definitely something he didn't need.	Ka sebele e ne e le seo a neng a sa se hloke.
Yet this will always be the case.	Leha ho le joalo sena se tla lula se le joalo.
We do not need to know.	Ha ho hlokahale hore re tsebe.
I just had to ask.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho botsa feela.
They are fun for me.	Li monate ho 'na.
You must	O tlameha ho
I had no idea what it was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke eng.
Well, from the whole.	Joalo, ho tsoa ho tsohle.
I see that happening.	Ke bona seo se etsahala.
You did not eat.	Ha ua ka ua ja.
It's the last day today, and then you tell me.	Ke letsatsi la ho qetela kajeno, 'me joale oa mpolella.
I was reading about what was going on here.	Ke ne ke bala ka se etsahalang mona.
Many years are still to come.	Lilemo tse ngata li ntse li tla nka nako e telele.
That's how he thought.	Ke kamoo a ileng a nahana kateng.
Sometimes people find reason to doubt.	Ka linako tse ling batho ba fumana lebaka la ho belaela.
There is no help but one.	Ha ho na thuso ntle le e 'ngoe.
Want to read more ???.	U batla ho bala haholoanyane ???.
But wait, you have to tell me your name first.	Empa ema, u tlameha ho mpolella lebitso la hau pele.
It does not matter.	Ha e bohlokoa.
She was still feeling very shy.	O ne a ntse a ikutloa a le lihlong haholo.
Obviously, that was not their business.	Ho hlakile hore e ne e se taba ea bona.
We'll fix all that when you're better.	Re tla lokisa tseo tsohle ha o se o le betere.
I want to get out.	Ke batla ho tsoa.
In fact he did nothing to know.	Ha e le hantle ha aa ka a etsa letho ho tseba.
As the years passed, he continued to work.	Ha lilemo li ntse li feta, o ile a tsoela pele ho sebetsa.
It was not just mine.	E ne e se ea ka feela.
Very nice picture.	Setšoantšo se setle haholo.
Then do not go to law school.	Ebe u se ke ua ea sekolong sa molao.
You can do it and you will do it.	U ka e etsa 'me u tla e etsa.
I could not eat it.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho e ja.
He obviously loves it.	Ho hlakile hore oa e rata.
I don't know where it would have gone.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e ka be e ile kae.
I no longer had to meet them.	Ke ne ke se ke sa lokela ho kopana le bona.
Maybe they get it.	Mohlomong baa e fumana.
Only its head was in the room.	Ke hlooho ea eona feela e neng e le ka kamoreng.
I just worked.	Ke sa tsoa sebetsa.
We're not sure what it is, exactly.	Ha re na bonnete ba hore ke eng, hantle.
Say what you need to say.	Bolela seo u hlokang ho se bua.
He had many questions.	O ne a e-na le lipotso tse ngata.
That's what man is.	Ke seo motho a leng sona.
However, that is unlikely to happen.	Leha ho le joalo, seo ha se na monyetla oa ho etsahala.
I know mine is like that.	Kea tseba hore ea ka e joalo.
I'll be back soon.	Ke tla be ke khutla hang.
For many years only.	Ka lilemo tse ngata feela.
They would help him.	Ba ne ba tla mo thusa.
Don't tell my husband!	U se ke ua bolella monna oa ka!
Do they know what you are talking about?	Na ba tseba seo o buang ka sona?
Some new ones, too.	Tse ling tse ncha, hape.
This is your last chance to do something about your life.	Ona ke monyetla oa ho qetela oa ho etsa ho hong ka bophelo ba hau.
That is exactly the point here.	Taba eo ehlile ke eona taba mona.
No, then everyone uses it.	Che, joale bohle ba e sebelisa.
I told my mother that none of these things were true.	Ke ile ka bolella ’Mè hore ha ho le e ’ngoe ea tsona eo e neng e le ’nete.
He worked hard.	O ile a sebetsa ka thata.
This does not exist, and it probably never will.	Sena ha se teng, 'me mohlomong ha ho mohla se tla.
It took time.	Ho nkile nako.
None of us did.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea ileng a etsa joalo.
I hope to see them sometime.	Ke tšepa ho ba bona ka nako e 'ngoe.
I know that well.	Ke tseba seo hantle.
I needed water.	Ke ne ke hloka metsi.
Then here's the thing.	Joale taba e ne e le ena.
I have always taken one from another.	Haesale ke nka e mong ho motho e mong.
Is there anything you can do about that?	Na ho na le seo u ka se etsang ka seo?
Maybe this will be a good thing.	Mohlomong sena se tla ba se setle.
They were of a certain kind.	E ne e le tsa mofuta o itseng.
This is a time-consuming process.	Ena ke mokhoa o batlang o ja nako.
Everyone was playing both.	E mong le e mong o ne a bapala ka bobeli.
Often at the same time.	Hangata ka nako e le 'ngoe.
It could have been.	E ka be e bile teng.
Maybe they'll do it.	Mohlomong ba tla e etsa.
As long as he wants to.	Ha feela a batla.
You mean.	U bolela.
Maybe, maybe more.	Mohlomong, mohlomong ho feta.
You might say.	U ka re.
This was exactly what he wanted.	Sena e ne e le sona seo a neng a se batla.
I'm not done yet.	Ha ke so qetile.
In my opinion there are no good friends you can have.	Ka maikutlo a ka ha ho na metsoalle e molemo eo u ka bang le eona.
Nothing has ever been quite right.	Ha ho letho le kileng la lekana hantle.
Is this the best way?	Na ena ke eona tsela e molemo ka ho fetisisa?
I think he got it from his father.	Ke nahana hore o e fumana ho ntate oa hae.
But he could not speak to her.	Empa o ne a sa khone ho bua le eena.
The young man drank his coffee.	Mohlankana o ile a noa kofi ea hae.
They tried to help.	Ba ile ba leka ho thusa.
I have money.	Ke na le chelete.
I'll start calling in the morning.	Ke tla qala ho letsa hoseng.
I asked for help.	Ke ile ka kopa thuso.
It did not happen overnight and it was not easy.	Ha ea ka ea etsahala ka letsatsi le le leng 'me ho ne ho se bonolo.
I did not want children.	Ke ne ke sa batle bana.
There was no such person.	Ho ne ho se motho ea joalo.
The important thing is that books do you good.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore libuka li u tsoela molemo.
Instead, they take it.	Ho e-na le hoo, ba e nka.
You may not be able to do it alone.	U ka 'na ua se ke ua khona ho e etsa u le mong.
I do not want his money.	Ha ke batle chelete ea hae.
He got in the back of the car.	A palama ka morao ho koloi.
I am here for the baby.	Ke mona bakeng sa ngoana.
Well, now they do.	Be, joale ba etsa joalo.
In time, too.	Ka nako, hape.
That’s what we thought, though.	Ke seo re neng re se nahana, leha ho le joalo.
We all wished him well.	Kaofela re ile ra mo lakatsa.
Kids have a chance to get it, and that’s a problem.	Bana ba na le monyetla oa ho e fumana, 'me ke bothata.
To get in here you must have it.	Ho kena mona e tlameha ho ba le eona.
Please know my children.	Ke kopa le tsebe bana ba ka.
It's a wonderful feeling.	Ke maikutlo a monate.
That's not his way.	Ha se tsela ya hae eo.
He wanted to leave, but he could not.	O ne a batla ho tsamaea, empa o ne a sa khone.
She says thank you.	E re kea mo leboha.
It doesn't really need player production.	Ha e hlile ha e hloke tlhahiso ea sebapali.
I would like the same thing.	Ke kopa ntho e tšoanang.
The door slammed.	Lemati la lla.
They would all pay.	Ba ne ba tla lefa kaofela.
I just had to do it.	Ke ne ke tlameha feela ho e etsa.
That was a way to learn more.	Eo e bile mokhoa oa ho ithuta haholoanyane.
I have nothing.	Ha ke na letho.
You just finished it.	U qeta ho e qeta.
My head starts to ache.	Hlooho ea ka e qala ho utloa bohloko.
They had no children.	Ba ne ba se na bana.
So talk to me, as you can.	Kahoo bua le 'na, ha u ntse u ka khona.
This will be soon.	Sena se tla ba kapele.
Very strange.	E makatsang haholo.
He picked up the book.	A nka buka eo.
You must do this before you leave the area.	U tlameha ho etsa sena pele u tloha sebakeng seo.
The point is.	Taba ke hore.
You are better off everywhere.	O betere sebakeng se seng le se seng.
Thanks for arriving on time.	Ke leboha ho fihla ka nako.
He saw nothing.	Ha a ka a bona letho.
I see you just as you are.	Ke u bona feela joalo ka uena.
They went to work.	Ba ile mosebetsing.
The problem is with us.	Bothata ke rona.
So he said anyway.	Kahoo o ile a re leha ho le joalo.
They did not find it.	Ha baa ka ba e fumana.
Nobody knew anything.	Ho ne ho se motho ya tsebang letho.
And often, they will not.	'Me hangata, ba ke ke ba etsa joalo.
Because it was us.	Hobane e ne e le rona.
I need everyone from this place now.	Ke hloka bohle ho tloha sebakeng sena hona joale.
But he did not fall.	Empa ha a ka a wa.
As long as we can come back at dinner time.	Ha feela re ka khutla ka nako ea lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I wish you could do that.	Ke lakatsa eka u ka etsa joalo.
Maybe he would make a picture afterwards, or maybe not.	Mohlomong o ne a tla etsa setšoantšo ka mor'a moo, kapa mohlomong che.
That's all true.	Ke 'nete eohle eo.
That would be the rule.	Seo e tla be e le molao.
Maybe even today.	Mohlomong le kajeno.
This will not continue.	Sena se ke ke sa tsoela pele.
So, think about that.	Kahoo, nahana ka seo.
That was very difficult for me.	Seo se ne se le boima haholo ho 'na.
It's a little strong.	E matla hanyane.
The same is true of him.	Ho joalo le ka eena.
In this room.	Ka kamoreng ena.
Many people live there.	Batho ba bangata ba lula moo.
But we do not have him here or any of the others.	Empa ha re na eena mona kapa e mong oa ba bang.
Which is to say.	E leng hore ho joalo.
However, it is never his.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho mohla e leng oa hae.
But that will not be the case.	Empa hoo ho ka se be jwalo.
Good news!	Litaba tse monate!
You find it very nice.	U e fumana e le ntle haholo.
We saw her at the party	Re ile ra mo bona moketeng
I really do.	Ke hlile ke etsa joalo.
They have been waiting for us.	Esale ba re emetse.
Time is of the essence.	Nako e kotsi.
But that is not enough.	Empa hoo ha hoa lekana.
They will walk in his name.	Ba tla tsamaea ka lebitso la hae.
But that is not what this question is about.	Empa ha se seo potso ena e leng sona.
However, he did not come out.	Leha ho le joalo, ha aa ka a tsoa.
You need to know what it is.	U lokela ho tseba hore na ke eng.
I tried to cry but it also hurt.	Ke ile ka leka ho lla empa hoo le hona ho bohloko.
But after that, there would be no going back.	Empa ka mor'a moo, ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba le ho khutlela morao.
He should not have been with us there.	O ne a sa lokela ho ba le rona moo.
I want to read these soon.	Ke batla ho bala tsena haufinyane.
I have never wanted anyone.	Ha ke so batle motho leha e le ofe.
I can go alone.	Nka tsamaea ke le mong.
It was so.	Ho bile joalo.
I see him almost every day.	Ke mo bona hoo e ka bang letsatsi le leng le le leng.
He has been busy.	Haesale a phathahane.
It's a human way.	Ke tsela ya motho.
He needed her.	O ne a mo hloka.
But one thing seems certain.	Empa ntho e le 'ngoe e bonahala e ka etsahala.
He would get it soon.	O ne a tla fumana kapele.
That's right.	Ke 'nete.
I use them often.	Ke li sebelisa hangata.
To someone else it may not be one of those things.	Ho motho e mong e ka 'na ea se ke ea e-ba letho la lintho tseo.
I don't like his comments.	Ha ke rate maikutlo a hae.
I was very busy.	Ke ne ke phathahane haholo.
He is.	O joalo.
I need help.	Ke kopa thuso.
Here is the question.	Potso ke ena.
This will not be an issue for me.	Sena e ke ke ea e-ba taba ho 'na.
They decide what is real and what is not.	Ba etsa qeto ea hore na ke eng ea sebele le eo e seng eona.
You will never find someone who loves everything you love.	Ha ho mohla u tla fumana motho ea ratang ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo u e ratang.
If it is difficult, use.	Haeba ho thata, sebelisa.
I could not see.	Ke ne ke sa bone.
We loved our children.	Re ne re rata bana ba rona.
Several ideas.	Maikutlo a 'maloa.
I was not supposed to drive here.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho khanna mona.
Find out who can apply now.	Fumana hore na ke mang ea ka etsang kopo hona joale.
I use it all the time !.	Ke e sebelisa ka linako tsohle!.
Pain and pleasure.	Bohloko le monate.
I can't figure out how.	Ha ke khone ho tseba hore na joang.
And we do.	'Me re etsa joalo.
And you know us.	'Me ua tseba rona.
Be careful.	Hlokomela.
My life, as it were, would be simple.	Bophelo ba ka, joalo ka ha bo le joalo, bo ne bo tla ba bonolo.
It goes on and on.	E ntse e tsoela pele.
Look at what we have.	Sheba seo re nang le sona.
I stood up, not giving up my former position.	Ke ile ka ema, ha kea ka ka tlohela boemo ba ka ba pele.
My husband would not be with me.	Monna oa ka o ne a ke ke a ba le 'na.
I loved it.	Ke ile ka e rata.
It was a wonderful day.	E ne e le letsatsi le monate.
Now, if you don't, the mind realizes it.	Jwale, ha o sa etse jwalo, kelello e a e hlokomela.
The new news gives people a reason to return.	Litaba tse ncha li fa batho lebaka la ho khutla.
He is sleeping now.	O robala jwale.
The first ones to like it.	Ba pele ba e ratang.
But he would love it.	Empa o ne a tla e rata.
I will try to find out.	Ke tla leka ho tseba.
She had children.	O ile a fumana bana.
I have never, never thought you could do that.	Ha ke eso, le ka mohla ke sa nahane hore o ka etsa jwalo.
I worked hard.	Ke ne ke sebetsa ka thata.
That's very good.	Seo se hantle haholo.
My mother is with us.	'Mè o na le rona.
No books say.	Ha ho libuka tse buang.
He checked the time.	O ile a sheba nako.
I did some other than this group.	Ke entse tse ling ntle le sehlopha sena.
Status status.	Boemo ba mofuta.
He was not sure why.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na hobaneng.
No, it did not.	Che, ho ile ha feta nako e telele ka mor'a moo.
I thought it might be him.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e ka 'na eaba ke eena.
I was often alone.	Hangata ke ne ke le mong feela.
He did just that.	O entse seo hantle.
One needs to know the other.	Ho hlokahala hore motho a tsebe e mong.
I am sure time will pass quickly.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore nako e tla feta kapele.
This worked very well for me.	Sena se ile sa sebetsa hantle haholo ho nna.
We would love to have some of them.	Re ka thabela ho ba le tse ling tsa tsona.
Yes, this is it.	E, ke eona ena.
Gently.	Ka bonolo.
We'll see how it goes.	Re tla bona hore na e tsamaea joang.
He can't say his way out of this one.	A ke ke a bua tsela ea hae ea ho tsoa ho ena.
Everyone stopped to watch.	Batho bohle ba ile ba ema ho shebella.
I did not ask, he did not give.	Ha kea ka ka botsa, ha a ka a fana.
I never thought he would go.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore o tla ea.
We do everything together.	Re etsa tsohle hammoho.
However, it was a possibility.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le ntho e ka etsahalang.
I'm sure there is nothing there.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ha ho letho moo.
Then move on with your life.	Ebe u tsoela pele ka bophelo ba hau.
All they think about is money.	Seo ba se nahanang feela ke chelete.
And that is how we will end it.	Mme ke kamoo re tla e qeta.
It was not necessary.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale.
They are alive, he thought.	Ba phela, a nahana.
It looks very nice.	E shebahala e le ntle haholo.
Say you will.	E re u tla etsa joalo.
It has been since then.	Haesale ho tloha ka nako eo.
When the time came to work, we were working.	Ha nako ea ho sebetsa e fihla, re ne re sebetsa.
You have to decide.	O tlameha ho etsa qeto.
Get away from them hard.	Tloha ho bona ka thata.
The baby cried a lot.	Ngoana a lla haholo.
He was passing by.	O ne a feta moo.
The first is good.	Ea pele e ntle.
And you do not find many of them.	'Me ha u fumane tse ngata tsa tsona.
He should not stand on his feet this time.	Ha aa lokela ho ema ka maoto nakong ena.
Have a nice day!	Eba le letsatsi le monate!
I wanted to do that.	Ke ne ke batla hore ke etse joalo.
You know how he feels about that house with his mother.	Ua tseba hore na o ikutloa joang ka ntlo eo le 'mè oa hae.
Here is mine.	Ea ka ke ena.
He hopes more money will help.	O tšepa hore chelete e ngata e tla thusa.
I took his money.	Ke nkile chelete ea hae.
Without this place I would not be where I am today.	Ntle le sebaka sena ke ne nke ke ka ba moo ke leng teng kajeno.
When he got home he did not stay long.	Ha a fihla hae ha aa ka a lula nako e telele.
Find a way.	Fumana tsela.
It was painful.	E ne e bile bohloko.
Or not, but he certainly would try.	Kapa che, empa ka sebele o ne a tla leka.
If you feel tired, go to bed.	Haeba u ikutloa u khathetse, robala.
You can even find some of them in a relatively simple way.	U ka ba ua fumana tse ling tsa tsona ka mokhoa o batlang o le bonolo.
He can't do anything.	Ha a khone ho etsa letho.
There is no place to stay.	Haho sebaka sa ho dula.
Check out the evening news.	Sheba litaba tsa mantsiboea.
I will have to learn more about these things.	Ke tla tlameha ho ithuta haholoanyane ka lintho tsena.
Without them, this would not have happened.	Ntle ho bona, sena se ka be se sa etsahala.
It is my strength.	Ke matla a ka.
But he had friends.	Empa o ne a e-na le metsoalle.
Really for real for real.	Ka sebele bakeng sa sebele bakeng sa sebele.
It was very difficult to say.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo ho bolela.
It looks very simple.	E bonahala e le bonolo haholo.
So he must have been here before.	Kahoo e tlameha ebe o ne a le mona pele.
He was just passing through the area.	O ne a feta feela sebakeng seo.
But you usually do it because you want to.	Empa hangata o e etsa hobane o batla.
And about that.	Le ka seo.
However, there is a problem with this.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le bothata ka sena.
I really need to talk to her.	Ke hlile ke hloka ho bua le eena.
He shouldn't have come, he thinks.	O ne a sa lokela ho tla, o nahana jwalo.
You would buy, buy, buy.	U ne u tla reka, reka, reka.
He wanted to stand up.	O ne a batla ho ema.
But we have a lot of time together.	Empa re na le nako e ngata hammoho.
Of course he is.	Ehlile o teng.
He has been there a long time.	O bile moo nako e telele.
Without it, he exists.	Ntle le, o teng.
We can't take this.	Ha re khone ho nka sena.
However, I can be real.	Leha ho le joalo, nka ba oa sebele.
But he is still learning.	Empa o ntse a ithuta.
We'll see about that tomorrow.	Re tla bona hosane ka taba eo.
You can too.	Le uena u ka khona.
He just couldn't get out now.	O ne a sa khone ho tsoa feela joale.
Method.	Mokhoa.
It was as if nothing had happened.	E ne eka ha ho letho le etsahetseng.
This is certainly true.	Ka sebele sena ke ’nete.
It felt.	E ile ea ikutloa.
There are many.	Ho na le tse ngata.
Just leave it at that.	Tlohela seo feela.
And the boy is not easy.	'Me moshanyana ha a bonolo.
This player told the best news.	Sebapali sena se ile sa bolela litaba tse molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Well you get the idea.	Hantle o fumana mohopolo.
We heard about that.	Re utloile ka seo.
I need several hours a day.	Ke hloka lihora tse ngata ka letsatsi.
He knew so much.	O ne a tseba hakaalo.
This will be fun.	Sena se tla ba monate.
We stayed there for no reason.	Re ile ra lula moo ntle le lebaka.
We all eat three meals together.	Re ja lijo tse tharo kaofela hammoho.
He had a father.	O ne a ena le ntate.
Note that you are also using the route method here.	Hlokomela hore u sebelisa mokhoa oa tsela hape mona.
He was very busy.	O ne a phathahane haholo.
We enter.	Re kena.
Not too long ago, he could not even hear anything bad.	Ha se khale haholo, o ne a sa khone le ho utloa ntho e mpe.
I can take it.	Nka e nka.
Leave with you now.	Tloha le uena joale.
My mother uses it regularly.	'Mè o e sebelisa nako le nako.
I did not know his name.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe lebitso la hae.
I hope this year he will do the same.	Ke tšepa hore selemong sena o tla etsa joalo.
Some of them are mine.	Tse ling tsa tsona ke tsa ka.
I'm sure someone will get to it.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore motho o tla fihla ho eona.
I know it was you.	Kea tseba hore e ne e le uena.
I'll be back then.	Ke tla khutla ka nako eo.
That's the person.	Ke motho eo.
If not today, tomorrow, soon.	Haeba e se kajeno, hosane, haufinyane.
It hurts to find out.	Ho bohloko ho fumana.
And they wondered why.	Mme ba ipotsa hore hobaneng.
He begins to fall.	O qala ho wa.
I do not want to give up.	Ha ke batle ho e tlohela.
It is easy to say no.	Ho bonolo ho hana.
Everyone knows everyone.	E mong le e mong o tseba bohle.
We kept talking about him.	Re ile ra lula re bua ka eena.
He is here with us.	O mona le rona.
I go back all the time.	Ke khutlela morao ka linako tsohle.
I think both are true.	Ke nahana hore bobeli ke 'nete.
Lol.	Ha ha ha.
But good things.	Empa lintho tse ntle.
But again, that will take time.	Empa hape, seo se tla nka nako.
Some say the love of others is something.	Ba bang ba bolela ho rata ha ba bang ntho e 'ngoe.
Things are not the same anymore.	Lintho ha li sa le joalo.
However, the problem is easy to understand.	Leha ho le joalo, bothata bo bonolo ho bo utloisisa.
At the same time there are problems.	Ka nako e tšoanang ho na le mathata.
Police team!	Sehlopha sa mapolesa!
We can have no one but you.	Re ke ke ra ba le e mong ntle le uena.
But everyone decided to move on.	Empa bohle ba ile ba etsa qeto ea ho tsoela pele.
That's what it is.	Ke eona taba eo.
They said we went back a lot.	Ba ile ba bolela hore re ile ra khutlela morao haholo.
Try this booklet.	Leka buka ena.
I just looked at him.	Ke ile ka mo sheba feela.
One morning a phone call came in for him.	Hoseng ho hong mohala o ile oa kena bakeng sa hae.
That's good news.	Ke litaba tse monate.
We think it works well.	Re nahana hore e sebetsa hantle.
However, he could not.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa khone.
All of you.	Kaofela ha lona.
Just do your kind.	Etsa feela mofuta oa hau.
It certainly exists.	Ka sebele e teng.
Traveling was very difficult for you.	Ho tsamaea ho ne ho le boima haholo bakeng sa hau.
You would not understand about that.	U ne u ke ke ua utloisisa ka seo.
I had to give up this thing.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tlohela ntho ena.
You can stay.	U ka lula.
It was too late to ask him.	E ne e se e le morao haholo ho mo botsa.
No, nothing happens.	Che, ha ho letho le etsahalang.
We are not talking about dinner.	Ha re bue ka lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I agree, kids just need to play.	Kea lumela, bana ba hloka feela ho bapala.
It is easy to read.	Ho bonolo ho e bala.
So far, nothing.	Ho fihlela joale, ha ho letho.
However, he understood.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a utloisisa.
Also, be aware of where you are going and how you are doing.	Hape, hlokomela hore na u tsamaea hokae le hore na u tsamaea joang.
I have important things to do.	Ke na le lintho tsa bohlokoa tseo ke lokelang ho li etsa.
Here is one simple thing you can do.	Ntho e le 'ngoe e bonolo eo u ka e etsang ke ena.
But time will tell!	Empa ka sebele nako e tla bolela!.
He does it every day.	O e etsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
He studied her carefully.	O ile a mo ithuta ka hloko.
I had to learn to live.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho ithuta ho phela.
The young man did not stop.	Mohlankana ha a ka a ema.
I want to try it again if it will work.	Ke batla ho e leka hape haeba e tla sebetsa.
He looked strong now.	O ne a shebahala a le matla joale.
Because he knows.	Hobane oa tseba.
Of course he will.	Ehlile o tla etsa joalo.
The same problem exists here.	Bothata bo tšoanang bo teng mona.
It is a state of being.	Ke boemo ba ho ba teng.
Now let's see what I have.	Joale a re bone seo ke nang le sona.
There is simply no application.	Ha ho na kopo feela.
There will usually be no stopping.	Hangata ha ho na ho ema.
Take care of your dog.	Hlokomela ntja ea hau.
I need a little.	Ke hloka hanyane.
However, it will not be so bad.	Leha ho le joalo, e ka se be mpe hakaalo.
This is not yet strong enough.	Sena ha se eso be matla ka ho lekana.
It was not just today.	E ne e se kajeno feela.
Find out where they are.	Fumana moo ba leng teng.
I wondered if it was him.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na ebe ke eena.
I saw you eating breakfast.	Ke u bone u ja lijo tsa hoseng.
I had a great time.	Ke bile le nako e monate.
It was fun.	E ne e le monate.
It must be so.	E tlameha ebe ho joalo.
He wants to get an empty house.	O batla ho fumana ntlo e se nang letho.
That one stands.	Eo oa ema.
It will require work.	E tla hloka mosebetsi.
The same is true now.	Ho joalo le hona joale.
I did not ask him why.	Ha kea ka ka mo botsa hore na ke hobane'ng.
Then they would come back for me.	Joale ba ne ba tla khutla bakeng sa ka.
You need to know better.	O lokela ho tseba betere.
So that's how things will work out.	Kahoo ke kamoo lintho li tlang ho sebetsa kateng.
There were not enough people.	Ho ne ho se batho ba lekaneng.
I should not speak.	Ha kea lokela ho bua.
Do not feel.	U se ke ua ikutloa.
They would tell her husband.	Ba ne ba tla bolella monna oa hae.
But that is not all.	Empa ha se seo feela.
That was a very good idea.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo o motle haholo.
Leave here.	Tlohela mona.
A place like us.	Sebaka se kang rona.
I would stay with him and his wife.	Ke ne ke tla lula le eena le mosali oa hae.
That's how we bought them.	Ke kamoo re neng re li reka kateng.
That's him.	Ke eena.
I'm glad you're here.	Ke thabetse hore ebe u teng.
However, it would take time.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho tla nka nako.
I do not understand.	Ha ke utloisise.
And this should be simple.	'Me sena se lokela ho ba bonolo.
He reads everything.	O bala tsohle.
He observed others doing the same.	O ile a hlokomela ba bang ba etsa se tšoanang.
Of course, there are many more.	Ehlile, ho na le tse ling tse ngata.
Instead, you just spend the money.	Ho e-na le hoo, u sebelisa chelete feela.
This was no longer available.	Sena se ne se se se le sieo.
The taste is delicious.	Monate o monate.
Thank you so much!	Ke leboha haholo!
They repaired their first job.	Ba ile ba lokisa mosebetsi oa bona oa pele.
Someone would walk away.	Motho e mong o ne a tla tsamaea.
He knew his father better than anyone else.	O ne a tseba ntate oa hae ho feta mang kapa mang.
No need to comment.	Ha ho hlokahale ho fana ka maikutlo.
It cannot exist without it.	E ke ke ea ba teng ntle le eona.
He was drinking.	O ne a ntse a noa.
It is a space without space.	Ke sebaka se se nang sebaka.
They love their children.	Ba rata bana ba bona.
He said thank you.	A re kea leboha.
He did not know if he had heard it.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na o e utloile.
I know you haven't got it yet.	Ke a tseba hore ha o eso e fumane.
He knows what you need.	O tseba seo o se hlokang.
This is very difficult.	Sena se thata haholo.
I was afraid this would happen.	Ke ne ke tšaba hore sena se tla etsahala.
But some can.	Empa ba bang ba ka khona.
After a few hours.	Ka mor'a lihora tse 'maloa.
He is a strange man.	Ke monna ya makatsang.
There was only one way to get started.	Ho ne ho e-na le mokhoa o le mong feela oa ho qala.
I love them so much.	Ke ba rata haholo.
He would be there.	O ne a tla be a le teng.
However, there are other problems.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le mathata a mang.
But do nothing.	Empa u se ke ua etsa letho.
I do not know him well.	Ha ke mo tsebe hantle.
That had to go.	Seo se ne se lokela ho tsamaea.
But the second proposal did not materialize.	Empa tlhahiso ea bobeli ha ea ka ea fihla.
Staying with him.	Ho lula le eena.
He took it with him.	O ile a e nka le eena.
Your life is very difficult right now, but you have to keep trying.	Bophelo ba hau bo thata haholo hona joale, empa u tlameha ho lula u leka.
So will you.	Le uena u tla ba joalo.
He said he could not help her.	O ile a bolela hore a ke ke a mo thusa.
It's just fun.	E monate feela.
Maybe that's very questionable.	Mohlomong seo se botsa haholo.
I love them too.	Ke ba rata hape.
And he would not forget.	Mme a ka be a sa ka a lebala.
But we can't have that.	Empa re ka se be le seo.
You can visit her before then if you like.	U ka mo etela pele ho nako eo haeba u rata.
I just looked at it.	Ke ile ka e sheba feela.
Visible only to you.	E bonahala ho uena feela.
It could be both.	E ka ba bobeli.
Have you finished your homework?	Na u se u qetile mosebetsi oa hau oa sekolo?
You can do this outside of your job.	U ka etsa sena ka ntle ho mosebetsi oa hau.
He took the place before me.	O ile a nka sebaka pele ho nna.
My father knew this.	Ntate o ne a tseba sena.
And you finally get what you want.	Mme qetellong o fumana seo o se batlang.
He knows that.	O tseba seo.
Except for his parents.	Ntle le batsoali ba hae.
Do it three times.	Etsa ka makhetlo a mararo.
Lots to try.	Tse ngata tsa ho leka.
No one asked him anything.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo botsa letho.
Now he has to work and take care of his children.	Joale o tlameha ho sebetsa le ho hlokomela bana ba hae.
This is true.	Sena ke 'nete.
You don't want me to have anything of my own.	Ha o batle hore ke be le letho la ka.
I was fine, though.	Ke ne ke le hantle, leha ho le joalo.
All were well.	Bohle ba ne ba phela hantle.
Obviously they do.	Ho hlakile hore ba etsa joalo.
Do you want to.	Na u batla.
He has some certainty.	O na le bonnete bo itseng.
He wants a team.	O batla sehlopha.
Maybe he doesn't know, but it's his.	Mohlomong ha a tsebe, empa ke wa hae.
Work on something.	Sebetsa ho hong.
Work is important but difficult.	Mosebetsi o bohlokoa empa o boima.
To be better.	Ea ho ba betere.
So it could be with a man.	Kahoo ho ne ho ka ba joalo ka monna.
He said he had his phone.	O ile a re o ne a e-na le mohala oa hae.
I'm so glad you didn't get hurt.	Ke thabile haholo hore ebe ha oa tsoa kotsi.
And it uses energy.	'Me e sebelisa matla.
So, on that point.	Kahoo, ka taba eo.
Or rather, they are.	Kapa ho e-na le hoo, ba joalo.
I like shopping.	Ke rata ho reka.
You do not have to leave right away.	Ha oa lokela ho tsamaea kapele.
However, we were not so much together.	Leha ho le joalo, re ne re se monate hakaalo hammoho.
I will just do it.	Ke tla etsa joalo feela.
Sometimes he would cry while eating.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a lla ha a ntse a ja.
Or to his home.	Kapa ho ea hae.
I love everything about it.	Ke rata ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ka eona.
There is a house	Ho na le ntlo
He sees the need for a new path.	O bona ho hlokahala tsela e ncha.
My father did not know.	Ntate o ne a sa tsebe.
It's easy to get sidetracked, if you try hard enough.	Ho bonolo ho se fumane lintho, haeba u leka ka matla ho lekana.
But it would be fun.	Empa ho ne ho tla ba monate.
They wanted something.	Ba ne ba batla ho hong.
I work very well.	Ke sebetsa hantle haholo.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
This is what needs to happen.	Sena ke sona se lokelang ho etsahala.
You are important.	U na le bohlokoa.
However, otherwise, the room was empty.	Leha ho le joalo, ho seng joalo, kamore eo e ne e se na letho.
But many do not.	Empa ba bangata ha ba etse joalo.
I think there is a real benefit to that.	Ke nahana hore ho na le molemo oa sebele ho seo.
I was just starting to think about it.	Ke ne ke qala ho nahana ka eona.
Now is my time.	Joale ke nako ea ka.
Talk about it.	Ho bua ka eona.
He was going to try.	O ne a ntse a tla leka.
I couldn’t go back to that.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho khutlela ho seo.
We find it necessary to speak with just one.	Re fumana ho hlokahala hore re bue le e le ’ngoe feela.
And so it was.	Mme ho ne ho le jwalo.
Something new is needed.	Ho hlokahala ntho e ncha.
It is the best day ever.	Ke letsatsi le molemo ka ho fetisisa.
This house is everything we could ever want or need.	Ntlo ena ke ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo re ka e batlang kapa re e hlokang.
In the evening you come to see them.	Mantsiboea u tla ho bona.
I do not know if we are at that time.	Ha ke tsebe hore na re nakong eo.
It needed real emotion.	E ne e hloka maikutlo a sebele.
He did not do everything right.	Ha a ka a etsa tsohle hantle.
Mine was even better.	Ea ka e ne e le betere le ho feta.
She seemed happy.	O ne a bonahala a thabile.
That is if we finish on time.	Ke hore haeba re qeta ka nako.
However, I want to know how to do it.	Leha ho le joalo, ke batla ho tseba ho e etsa.
All that.	Tsohle tseo.
He will be there.	O tla be a le teng.
Or maybe it wasn't at all.	Kapa mohlomong e ne e se hoo ho hang.
I felt something almost perfect.	Ke ile ka utloa ntho e batlang e lekana hantle.
Still, he was happy.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a thabile.
They have something they want to say.	Ba na le seo ba batlang ho se bua.
But you can do it.	Empa u ka e etsa.
He can't hold it.	Ha a khone ho e tšoara.
We have no people.	Ha re na batho.
Everyone wanted to talk one last time.	E mong le e mong o ne a batla ho bua ka lekhetlo la ho qetela.
This state of affairs was not new.	Boemo bona ba lintho e ne e se ntho e ncha.
She does nothing to help.	Ha a etse letho ho thusa.
Because it works.	Ke hobane e sebetsa.
She doesn't look happy.	Ha a bonahale a thabile.
We will meet.	Re tla kopana.
Everything seems to be working fine.	Ho bonahala eka tsohle li sebetsa hantle.
It was there before.	E ne e le teng pele.
I think there must be something wrong.	Ke nahana hore e tlameha ebe ho na le phoso.
One, when you made a mistake.	E 'ngoe, ha u entse phoso.
I can do that better than he can.	Nka etsa seo hantle ho feta kamoo a ka khonang.
He took the opportunity.	O ile a nka monyetla.
And you don't see anything you didn't expect to see in a place like that.	Mme ha o bone letho leo o neng o sa lebella ho le bona sebakeng se jwalo.
I usually work late at night.	Ke tloaetse ho sebetsa bosiu haholo.
Did he go back.	Na o ile a khutlela morao.
But there are also problems.	Empa le hona ho na le mathata.
So he took his dog with him.	Kahoo a nka ntja ea hae le eena.
Somehow, no one had it.	Ka tsela e itseng, ha ho le ea mong ea neng a e-na le eona.
It was an easy task.	E ne e le mosebetsi o bonolo.
He must have known for a long time.	E tlameha ebe o ne a tseba nako e telele.
I would not even tell them about it.	Ke ne nke ke ka ba bolella le ka eona.
It was a long time, he felt.	E ne e le nako e telele, a ikutloa.
I went through it.	Ke ile ka feta ho eona.
They will tell you anything.	Ba tla u bolella eng kapa eng.
Some things we do not yet know.	Lintho tse ling ha re e-so tsebe.
He looked at it.	A e sheba.
We knew it would take a while.	Re ne re tseba hore ho tla nka nako e seng kae.
He looked at the big man.	A sheba monna e moholo.
But he knew what his job was.	Empa o ne a tseba hore na mosebetsi oa hae ke ofe.
But he still looked like a child.	Empa o ne a ntse a shebahala joaloka ngoana.
When he passed, he said well.	Ha a feta, o ile a re hantle.
We will be back for sure !.	Re tla khutla ka 'nete!.
People do things.	Batho ba etsa lintho.
He refuses to talk about his feelings.	O hana ho bua ka maikutlo a hae.
I went to school.	Ke ile sekolong.
Or, maybe, always.	Kapa, ​​mohlomong, kamehla.
He refuses to see it.	O hana ho o bona.
You could hear us both.	U ne u ka re utloa ka bobeli.
However, it made me think.	Leha ho le joalo, e ile ea etsa hore ke nahane.
Some don't know, some know.	Ba bang ba sa tsebe, ba bang ba tseba.
If not, make it blank.	Haeba e le sieo, etsa e se nang letho.
So thank you all for being here.	Kahoo ke leboha bohle ho ba mona.
We did not stay long.	Ha rea ​​ka ra lula nako e telele.
It is better to sleep.	Ho molemo ho robala.
That's your problem.	Ke bothata ba hao.
To.	Ho ea ho.
Yet it did not have to be this way.	Leha ho le joalo ho ne ho sa lokela ho ba joalo.
Something that everyone wants.	Ntho eo bohle ba e batlang.
We will meet, work as one team.	Re tla kopana, re sebetsa re le sehlopha se le seng.
I told her that it would never happen again.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore ha ho sa tla hlola ho e-ba teng.
I really know it well.	Ke hlile ke e tseba hantle.
It is not fit for people to drink.	Ha ea lokela hore batho ba ka noa.
I'm glad he got it.	Ke thabela hore ebe o ile a o fumana.
Now here is the problem.	Joale bothata ke bona.
Stop, now is the time to go.	Ema, joale ke nako ea hore re tsamaee.
Everyone knew there was something to learn.	E mong le e mong o ne a tseba hore ho na le lintho tseo a lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
I refused to go.	Ke ile ka hana ho ea.
Maybe in the end he was tired.	Mohlomong qetellong o ne a khathetse.
To them they cannot live without it.	Ho bona ba ke ke ba phela ntle le eona.
Nobody noticed that, either.	Haho motho ya ileng a hlokomela seo, le hona.
I'm fine.	Ke phela hantle.
The phone rings a lot today.	Mohala o lla hangata kajeno.
My father will eat good food.	Ntate o tla ja lijo tse monate.
It is nothing new.	Ha se ntho e ncha.
Do not eat it.	U se ke ua e ja.
I stopped.	Ka ema.
But there was no money for that.	Empa ho ne ho se na chelete ea seo.
They just tell me what they want me to know.	Ba mpolella feela seo ba batlang hore ke se tsebe.
They would form an amazing team.	Ba ne ba tla etsa sehlopha se makatsang.
You should not have come here.	O ne o sa lokela ho tla mona.
I will ask questions.	Ke tla botsa lipotso.
I'll call you tomorrow.	Ke tla o letsetsa hosane.
A place to stay.	Sebaka sa ho dula.
He is strong.	O matla.
I had to go there.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho ea moo.
And then everyone will want to see it.	Mme ka nako eo bohle ba tla batla ho e bona.
It is a concept of it.	Ke maikutlo a eona.
I have a few of them.	Ke na le tse 'maloa tsa tsona.
It means he has no power.	Ho bolela hore ha a na matla.
But that was really good for me.	Empa hoo ho ne ho hlile ho le molemo ho ’na.
They needed a new teacher.	Ba ne ba hloka tichere e ncha.
I wish there was a place for me here.	Eka ho ne ho na le sebaka bakeng sa ka mona.
He can't stand it.	Ha a khone ho ema.
By then it was already the day.	Ka nako eo e ne e se e le letsatsi.
You should do this before the day.	U lokela ho etsa sena pele ho letsatsi.
I think he will play again.	Ke nahana hore o tla bapala hape.
He was a young man who made you care.	E ne e le mohlankana ea neng a etsa hore u tsotelle.
I no longer feel the need.	Ha ke sa utloa ho hlokahala.
You want to have as good a thing as you can.	U batla ho ba le lintho tse ntle kamoo u ka bang le tsona.
Things were starting to come together now.	Lintho li ne li qala ho kopana joale.
We still have it.	Re ntse re e-na le eona.
You can open it now.	U ka e bula hona joale.
He stared at her intently.	O ile a mo shebella ka hloko.
However, that did not work.	Leha ho le joalo, seo ha sea ka sa sebetsa.
That has been the case in the past.	Ho bile joalo nakong e fetileng.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
He just didn't know where.	O ne a mpa a sa tsebe hore na hokae.
We are both very happy with it.	Ka bobeli re thabile haholo ka eona.
You will talk about it soon.	U tla bua ka eona haufinyane.
We will try again next week.	Re tla leka hape bekeng e tlang.
Of course, I have to thank you.	Ehlile, ke tlameha ho le leboha.
Start with.	Qala ka .
And here it is, happening again.	Mme ke ena, e etsahala hape.
People see it, you're well dressed.	Batho ba le bone, le apere hantle.
He often forgets things.	Hangata o lebala lintho.
And we're here to stay.	Mme re mona ho dula.
I have been going there for years.	Ke na le lilemo ke ea moo.
He has no friends.	Ha a na metsoalle.
This has been difficult to document.	Sena se bile thata ho se ngola.
And to think about it, it can be a very good thing.	'Me ho nahana ka eona, e ka ba ntho e ntle haholo.
I wondered what he wanted me to want.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na o batla hore ke batle eng.
That is its function.	Ke mosebetsi oa eona.
But that was all he could do.	Empa e ne e le sohle seo a neng a ka se etsa.
They don’t, but you don’t know.	Ha ba etse joalo, empa ha u tsebe.
Obviously this was not appropriate.	Ho hlakile hore sena se ne se sa lokela.
There was nothing in my life that seemed real.	Ho ne ho se letho ka bophelo ba ka le neng le bonahala e le la sebele.
I'm not sure about that either.	Ha ke na bonnete ka seo le hona.
They looked good in the end.	Ba ile ba bonahala hantle qetellong.
However, it is not the same mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se phoso e tšoanang.
I know what you want.	Ke tseba seo o se batlang.
Obviously that is not the case.	Ho hlakile hore ho joalo ha se molao.
This issue is not enough.	Taba ena ha ea lekana.
These most will not do anything.	Tsena ka ho fetisisa li ke ke tsa etsa letho.
My work shoes.	Lieta tsa ka tsa mosebetsi.
He had no place for anyone.	O ne a se na sebaka bakeng sa mang kapa mang.
So, you know, there it is.	Kahoo, ua tseba, ho na le hoo.
I read that somewhere.	Ke ile ka bala seo kae kae.
I am sure many of them are very good.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore tse ngata tsa tsona li ntle haholo.
He loved his job.	O ne a rata mosebetsi oa hae.
He sat down.	A dula.
They would never talk about it at all.	Ho hang ba ne ba ke ke ba bua ka eona.
But he does not think about them, let alone talk about them.	Empa ha a nahane ka tsona, re se re sa bue ka tsona.
Or they could have done it as a group.	Kapa ba ka be ba e entse e le sehlopha.
She was devastated, and needed help.	O ne a utloile bohloko, a hloka thuso.
I would have cried.	Nka be ke ile ka lla.
Of many things.	Ea lintho tse ngata.
I don't know anything about it very well.	Ha ke tsebe letho ka eona hantle.
But that is not the case at all.	Empa ho hang ha ho joalo.
I knew it would be empty.	Ke ne ke tseba hore e tla be e se na letho.
There was no time to finish work.	Ho ne ho se nako ea ho qeta mosebetsi.
It wasn't too bad either.	Le eona e ne e se mpe hakaalo.
They talked about the same situation.	Ba ile ba bua ka eona boemo boo.
Most people did not even know why they were there.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba sa tsebe le hore na ke hobane’ng ha ba le moo.
That's exactly the rule.	Ehlile ke molao oo.
I was not there.	Ke ne ke le sieo.
But we are only good friends.	Empa re metsoalle e molemo feela.
Let him go.	A tsamaee.
Or it seems.	Kapa ho bonahala eka.
The young man looked at his feet.	Mohlankana a sheba maoto a hae.
It would be better for everyone except me.	Ho ka ba molemo ho bohle ntle le nna.
It passed very quickly.	E ile ea feta kapele haholo.
That might have been a better practice.	Eo e ka 'na eaba e ne e le mokhoa o betere.
Instead, we will help the needy.	Ho e-na le hoo, re tla thusa motho ea hlokang.
That site may contain content for you.	Sebaka seo se ka ba le litaba bakeng sa hau.
I had no idea what I was thinking.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke nahane eng.
What a man.	Motho ea joang.
He tried to open it.	A leka ho e bula.
Now, it just seems to stay there.	Jwale, ho bonahala ho dula moo feela.
I did not know at the time.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ka nako eo.
But nothing.	Empa ha ho letho.
Along with many other bad things.	Hammoho le lintho tse ling tse ngata tse mpe.
But these people really have nothing to say.	Empa ruri batho bana ha ba na seo ba se buang.
He seems to be alive.	Ho bonahala a ntse a phela.
He did not look at her.	Ha a ka a mo sheba.
I never went back to my parents.	Ha kea ka ka khutlela ho batsoali ba ka.
But this takes time.	Empa sena se nka nako.
So taking time is not my thing.	Kahoo ho nka nako ha se taba ea ka.
The man was very heavy.	Monna eo o ne a le boima haholo.
You can read by mind here.	U ka bala ka mohopolo mona.
This is what he does.	Sena ke seo a se etsang.
Then go outside.	Ebe u tsoela ka ntle.
You have had enough to eat.	U bile le lijo tse lekaneng.
I can find it again.	Nka e fumana hape.
That went well, but after that, it's not good.	Seo se ile sa tsamaea hantle, empa ka mor'a moo, ha se hantle.
No one else tried him.	Ha ho motho e mong ea kileng a mo leka.
He did not know what to do with it.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng ka hona.
And of course, it is very good.	'Me ha e le hantle, e ntle haholo.
And you see.	'Me oa bona.
This is what he did to her, thinking of her.	Sena ke seo a ileng a se etsa ho eena, a nahana ka eena.
Monna.	Monna.
In its first week.	Bekeng ea eona ea pele.
I called her at home.	Ke ile ka mo letsetsa hae.
That is if you want him.	Ke hore haeba u mo batla.
It will happen at some point.	E tla etsahala ka nako e itseng.
I heard about that.	Ke utloile ka seo.
Nice to talk to you.	Ke monate ho bua le wena.
A little fun.	Monate hanyane.
Meeting him was still very difficult for me.	Ho kopana le eena ho ne ho ntse ho le boima haholo ho 'na.
Leave now.	Tloha hona joale.
These are sad times.	Tsena ke linako tse bohloko.
Unless you have never told me.	Ntle le hore ha u so ka u mpolella.
Use certain powers.	Sebelisa matla a itseng.
He really didn't see anything.	O ne a hlile a sa bone letho.
Who will tell them?	Ke mang ea tla ba bolella?
Do not think about it.	U se ke ua nahana letho ka eona.
I wanted to tell you something.	Ke ne ke batla ho o bolella ho hong.
However, in advance.	Leha ho le joalo, esale pele.
It will be a difficult issue.	E tla ba taba e thata.
Being the greatest you can be.	Ho ba uena e moholo u ka khona.
I am very happy about this.	Ke thabile haholo ka sena.
Thank you so much for that.	Ke leboha haholo ka seo.
And so it was, too.	Mme ho ne ho le jwalo, hape.
I'm very early.	Ke pele haholo.
It was not about money.	E ne e se ka chelete.
He works very well.	O sebetsa hantle haholo.
I didn’t want to look like that.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho shebahala joalo.
He is a very simple person.	Ke motho ea bonolo haholo.
I know that is not the case.	Kea tseba hore ha ho joalo.
They have everything, of course, except money.	Ba na le tsohle, ha e le hantle, ntle le chelete.
The only thing that gives them a sense of place.	Ntho feela ho ba fa maikutlo a sebaka.
One after another.	E 'ngoe ka mor'a e 'ngoe.
I never understood it.	Ha ke eso e utloisise.
We felt like there was something wrong here.	Re ne re utloa eka ho na le ho hong ho phoso mona.
He agreed to talk to me.	O ile a lumela ho bua le ’na.
We cannot say yes.	Re ke ke ra re e.
So he had to know.	Kahoo o ne a lokela ho tseba.
You know that you did not intend to pay him back.	Ua tseba hore u ne u sa rera ho mo lefa.
We believe someone took it by mistake.	Re lumela hore motho e mong o e nkile ka phoso.
I thought he would come back.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tla khutla.
I couldn't do it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e etsa.
No one knows how to fix it.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang ho e lokisa.
By car, it took several hours.	Ka koloi, ho ile ha nka lihora tse 'maloa.
It will be good for you.	Ho tla ba molemo ho uena.
She came to learn a trade.	O ile a tla ho ithuta mosebetsi oa matsoho.
It says to me.	E re ho 'na.
There is a chance that someone else will start in his place.	Ho na le monyetla oa hore motho e mong o tla qala sebakeng sa hae.
Another important factor is comment.	E 'ngoe ea bohlokoa ke ho fana ka maikutlo.
But you would never know.	Empa u ne u ke ke ua e tseba.
So, what can we do about it?	Joale, re ka etsa’ng ka tsona?
Hard time, of course.	Nako e thata, ha e le hantle.
Of course, it gets even harder from there.	Ehlile, e ba thata le ho feta ho tloha moo.
This can take a long time.	Sena se ka nka nako e telele.
We are just a man and a woman.	Re mpa re le monna le mosali.
Forget about it all.	Lebala ka taba eo kaofela.
They wanted to play.	Ba ne ba batla ho bapala.
He is in you.	O ka ho wena.
Maybe you did.	Mohlomong u entse joalo.
That's right, that's right.	Ho joalo, ho joalo.
Do not forget who you are.	U se ke ua lebala hore na u mang.
That's what it needs more.	Ke seo e se hlokang ho feta.
Now he did not want to open it.	Joale o ne a sa batle ho e bula.
They had their day with me.	Ba bile le letsatsi la bona le nna.
During this work.	Nakong ea mosebetsi ona.
He does not eat.	Ha a je.
He didn't want to know now.	O ne a sa rate ho tseba jwale.
He was hard to understand.	O ne a le thata ho utloisisa.
They seemed to understand.	Ba ne ba bonahala ba utloisisa.
There is plenty of time.	Ho na le nako e ngata.
I didn't care.	Ke ne ke sa e tsotelle.
I like a lot of things.	Ke rata lintho tse ngata.
Keep reading to find out.	Tsoela pele ho bala ho fumana.
The only questions are how and how.	Lipotso feela ke hore na joang hona joang.
I meet him at his home.	Ke kopana le eena ha hae.
He did not want to tell his parents.	O ne a sa batle ho bolella batsoali ba hae.
However, thanks for reading, as always.	Leha ho le joalo, ke leboha ho bala, joalo ka kamehla.
We had a great time, and it was a wonderful day.	Re bile le nako e monate, mme e ne e le letsatsi le monate.
I will help you.	Ke tlo o thusa.
Time would tell.	Nako e ne e tla bolela.
I could be there for many years.	Nka ba moo ka lilemo tse ngata.
But I'm the only one who speaks.	Empa ke nna feela ya buang.
I hope it will work.	Ke tšepa hore e tla sebetsa.
Nothing seemed to be happening.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se letho le etsahalang.
But it was easy.	Empa ho ne ho le bonolo.
But there was a problem.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le bothata.
But that is obviously difficult.	Empa ho hlakile hore seo se thata.
This was really happening.	Sena se ne se hlile se etsahala.
It's a good thing to have it.	Ke ntho e molemo ho ba le eona.
There can be only one chance.	Ho ka ba le monyetla o le mong feela.
I can walk.	Ke khona ho tsamaea.
Then the car left the area.	Eaba koloi e tloha sebakeng seo.
That's exactly right.	Ho joalo hantle.
But it will actually take longer than that.	Empa ha e le hantle ho tla nka nako e telele ho feta moo.
We often talked about family and friends.	Hangata re ne re bua ka lelapa le metsoalle.
He still had things to do.	O ne a ntse a e-na le lintho tseo a lokelang ho li etsa.
However, that is not the question.	Leha ho le joalo, eo ha se potso e teng.
He was not there at the time.	Ka nako eo o ne a le sieo.
He is the last person they want.	Ke motho oa ho qetela eo ba mo batlang.
You can log in here.	U ka kena mona.
You have to go outside.	U tlameha ho tsoela ka ntle.
It's not your problem.	Ha se bothata ba hau.
He really didn't want to talk about it.	O ne a hlile a sa batle ho bua ka eona.
They look strong.	Li shebahala li le matla.
And so it is.	Mme ho jwalo.
He prepared a feast.	A lokisa mokete.
Decide which job you want.	Etsa qeto ea mosebetsi oo u o batlang.
However, this approach was problematic.	Leha ho le joalo, mokhoa ona o ne o e-na le mathata.
Work is work, and money is money.	Mosebetsi ke mosebetsi, 'me chelete ke chelete.
But something important is happening here.	Empa ho na le ntho ea bohlokoa e etsahalang mona.
Clearly, what he was saying was not true.	Ho hlakile hore seo a neng a se bua e ne e se ’nete.
But he thought that would pass.	Empa o ne a nahana hore seo se tla feta.
Of course, that is not the case.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho joalo.
It's not just me.	Ha se 'na feela.
They did not buy a house.	Ha baa ka ba reka ntlo.
It does not mean that you have to do it every day.	Ha se hore u tlameha ho e etsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
She was starting to cry.	O ne a qala ho lla.
Though they come.	Leha ba tla.
They know who they are and what they are.	Ba tseba seo ba leng sona le seo ba leng sona.
He was not present at that time.	O ne a le sieo ka nako eo.
She is the second child.	Ke ngoana oa bobeli.
That our law is great.	Eo molao oa rona o moholo.
Because of.	Ka lebaka la.
It really works.	Ehlile e ea sebetsa.
I do not have it.	Ha ke na eona.
Everyone said yes.	Bohle ba ile ba re e.
Maybe it was.	Mohlomong ho ne ho le jwalo.
Maybe he didn't have time to go.	Mohlomong o ne a se na nako ea ho tsamaea.
It is no longer an individual celebration.	Ha e sa le mokete oa motho ka mong.
He could not sleep that night because of the pain.	O ile a sitoa ho robala bosiung boo ka lebaka la bohloko.
In less than three years, he was able to return to work.	Pele ho feta lilemo tse tharo, o ile a khona ho khutlela mosebetsing.
I really like my job.	Ke hlile ke rata mosebetsi oa ka.
You just need to do it.	U hloka feela ho e etsa.
We never do that.	Ha ho mohla re etsang joalo.
He spoke quickly, emotionally.	A bua kapele, ka maikutlo.
I made a mistake though.	Ke entse phoso leha ho le joalo.
I feel very happy about those things.	Ke ikutloa ke thabile haholo ka lintho tseo.
Without time.	Ntle le nako.
They could write a book on the subject.	Ba ne ba ka ngola buka e buang ka taba eo.
What time is it?	Ke nako mang?
He has nothing.	Ha a na letho.
I did not have much time to do it.	Ke ne ke se na nako e telele ho e etsa.
He spent days trying to find his way.	O ile a qeta matsatsi a leka ho fumana tsela ea hae.
But it will happen.	Empa ho tla etsahala.
It works this way.	E sebetsa ka tsela ena.
You want to sleep.	U batla ho robala.
I would grab something from the other kids.	Ke ne ke tla tšoara ho hong ho tsoa ho bana ba bang.
It was too much.	Ho ne ho le ngata haholo.
They didn't say, they didn't say anything.	Ba ne ba sa bue, ba sa bue letho.
And if I have to visit every day I will come home.	Mme haeba ke hloka ho etela letsatsi le letsatsi ke tla ha.
More than he was last year.	Ho feta kamoo a neng a le kateng selemong se fetileng.
He lives in them now.	O phela ho tsona jwale.
I'm getting home.	Ke ntse ke fihla hae.
All you can do is attend.	Seo u ka se etsang feela ke ho ba teng.
As you wish.	Joalo ka ha u batla.
They knew it.	Ba ne ba e tseba.
I don't want that.	Ha ke batle seo.
That was where they first met.	Ke hona moo ba ileng ba qala ho kopana teng.
If not, it will be a week.	Ha ho joalo, e tla ba beke.
My son is like that.	Mora oa ka o joalo.
I had to leave.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tsamaea.
Who would pay in the end.	Ea neng a tla lefa qetellong.
It went as well as you expected.	E ile ea tsamaea hantle kamoo u neng u lebeletse kateng.
People take advantage.	Batho ba nka monyetla.
Anything to win.	Ntho efe kapa efe ho hlola.
Or think you do.	Kapa nahana hore u etsa joalo.
The children were tired.	Bana ba ne ba khathetse.
No problem, we were happy to do it.	Ha ho bothata, re ne re thabetse ho e etsa.
Or in it.	Kapa ho eona.
So far, it is still very fast.	Ho fihlela joale, e ntse e le kapele haholo.
Someone was coming.	Ho ne ho tla motho.
He would just have to trust her.	O ne a tla tlameha feela ho mo tšepa.
We can say that he really does have feelings.	Re ka re ehlile o na le maikutlo.
And he certainly did, when he met you.	Mme ehlile o entse jwalo, ha a kopana le wena.
He is of no use to us.	Ha a na thuso ho rona.
I like it a little bit.	Ke e rata hanyane.
This is a difficult thing.	Sena ke ntho e thata.
But that is not a problem.	Empa seo hase bothata.
So, here is what your application should do.	Kahoo, mona ke seo kopo ea hau e lokelang ho se etsa.
There is something.	Ho ntho e itseng.
The water is very soft.	Metsi a bonolo haholo.
We hope this never happens again.	Re tšepa hore sena se ke ke sa etsahala hape.
Parents ask if their child can live in it.	Batsoali ba botsa hore na ngoana oa bona a ka lula ho eona.
His mind was empty.	Kelello ea hae e ne e se na letho.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho tlohela.
They may like you.	Ba ka u rata.
You are an adult and a good doctor.	O motho e moholo le ngaka e ntle.
He loved her very much.	O ne a mo rata haholo.
That was good news.	Eo e ne e le litaba tse monate.
Let's not say no.	Ha re re ha ho joalo.
They did not give him any money.	Ha baa ka ba mo fa chelete leha e le efe.
Well, that's right.	Be, ehlile ho joalo.
It was weekly.	E ne e le beke le beke.
I want to make my own.	Ke batla ho etsa ea ka.
And they do well in that regard.	Mme ba sebetsa hantle mosebetsing oo.
I think I still have to work in space.	Ke nahana hore ke ntse ke tlameha ho sebetsa sebakeng.
Before long, many people knew where he was.	Ho e-s'o ee kae, batho ba bangata ba ile ba tseba hore na o hokae.
They work better.	Li sebetsa haholoanyane.
Very good.	Ho molemo haholo.
I loved him too.	Le nna ke ne ke mo rata.
I had a good feeling.	Ke ne ke e-na le maikutlo a monate.
It is morning.	Ke hoseng.
She looked like she was crying.	O ne a shebahala eka o ne a ntse a lla.
It was them.	E ne e le bona.
It was the first time he had used his name.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele a sebelisa lebitso la hae.
We would find him.	Re ne re tla mo fumana.
I never knew my mother, you see.	Ha ke eso tsebe mme wa ka, o a bona.
Do you think we should go there?	Na u nahana hore re lokela ho ea moo?
He stayed there a long time.	A dula moo nako e telele.
The girl may.	Ngoanana a ka 'na.
I doubt they will come back again.	Ke belaela hore na ba tla khutla hape.
I have heard about this.	Ke utloile ka taba ena.
He opened most of his life.	O ile a bula nako e ngata ea bophelo ba hae.
And it is not enough.	'Me ha hoa lekana.
And write a lot of other things.	Le ho ngola lintho tse ling tse ngata.
Everything seemed more than real.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e bonahala e feta ea sebele.
What they do.	Seo ba se etsang.
Such a good book.	Buka e ntle joalo.
My question here and now is.	Potso ea ka mona le hona joale ke.
But that did not work.	Empa seo ha sea ka sa sebetsa.
In the same year.	Selemong sona seo.
To a place where no one will find him.	Ho ea sebakeng seo ho seng motho ea tla mo fumana.
We don't want to, but we will.	Ha re batle, empa re tla etsa jwalo.
I can't find a way to fix it.	Ha ke fumane mokhoa oa ho e lokisa.
This was the first one.	Ena e ne e le ea pele.
So he did not.	Kahoo ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
Everyone should try to do their best.	E mong le e mong o lokela ho leka ho etsa sohle seo a ka se khonang.
He was driving a car.	O ne a khanna koloi.
But tell him to do something else.	Empa mo bolelle hore a etse ho hong hape.
He knows that.	O tseba taba eo.
You do not find it.	Ha o e fumane.
It is also sometimes difficult to find important ideas.	Hape ho thata ka linako tse ling ho fumana maikutlo a bohlokoa.
I need to know why they happen.	Ke hloka ho tseba hore na ke hobane'ng ha li etsahala.
I want that for you.	Ke batla seo bakeng sa hao.
What are you doing tonight?	U etsa'ng bosiung bona?
Some already have it.	Ba bang ba se ba ntse ba e-na le eona.
Those questions would have to stop.	Lipotso tseo li ne li tla tlameha ho ema.
You can go now, if you like.	O ka ya jwale, ha o rata.
He never talked about his job.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka mosebetsi oa hae.
Where we were going was not just an idea.	Hore na re ne re tla ea hokae e ne e se mohopolo feela.
We did not know what to do with it at the time.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na re etse eng ka eona ka nako eo.
He does not need.	Ha a hloke.
I know what this looks like, but.	Kea tseba hore na sena se shebahala joang, empa.
I wanted that.	Ke ne ke batla joalo.
This new road is so beautiful!	Tsela ena e ncha e ntle haholo!
I couldn't even try it.	Ke ne ke sitoa le ho e leka.
We need to find them.	Re hloka ho li fumana.
And they all knew this.	Mme bohle ba ne ba tseba sena.
I feel tired.	Ke ikutloa ke khathetse.
He gave up his name.	O ile a tlohela lebitso la hae.
All these things and more.	Lintho tsena tsohle le tse ling.
We take care of it.	Re e hlokomela.
We do not know what is required to do the work.	Ha re tsebe hore na ho hlokahala eng ho etsa mosebetsi.
Not good, it seems.	Ha se hantle, ho bonahala.
But that was not what he wanted to play with today.	Empa e ne e se seo a neng a batla ho bapala ka sona kajeno.
Both of his parents.	Batsoali ba hae ka bobeli.
But he did not want any of them.	Empa o ne a sa batle letho la tsona.
And that was exactly what you had for dinner.	'Me ke eona ntho eo u neng u e-na le eona bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I told you, it was a thing.	Ke le boleletse, e ne e le ntho.
I know how to do that.	Ke tseba ho etsa seo.
I hoped he could hear it.	Ke ne ke tšepa hore a ka e utloa.
But perhaps that is not the case.	Empa mohlomong ha ho joalo.
Nothing happens without her knowing.	Ha ho letho le etsahalang ntle le hore a tsebe.
There was a nice restaurant nearby.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntlo ea lijo tse monate e haufi le moo.
Do one thing at a time.	Etsa ntho e le 'ngoe ka nako.
She never looked better.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a shebahala a le motle ho feta.
I just wanted to thank you.	Ke ne ke batla ho le leboha feela.
Tomorrow take it.	Le hosane le nke.
I just did my job.	Ke entse mosebetsi oa ka feela.
That will be fun.	Seo se tla ba monate.
The girl is so beautiful.	Ngoanana e motle haholo.
They become close friends.	E ba metsoalle e haufi.
My father does not care.	Ntate ha a tsotelle.
He did not need my help.	O ne a sa hloke thuso ea ka.
Everyone tried to get there.	E mong le e mong o ile a leka ho fihla moo.
The house was beautiful.	Ntlo e ne e le ntle.
They told you not to come.	Ba le boleletse hore le se ke la tla.
Instead, this would work in the same way as driving power.	Ho e-na le hoo, sena se ne se tla sebetsa ka tsela e tšoanang le matla a ho khanna.
This could be my chance.	Ona e ka ba monyetla oa ka.
But it is very powerful.	Empa e matla haholo.
I think he went.	Ke nahana hore o ile.
I was a strong guy.	Ke ne ke le mohlankana ea matla.
Thank you and enjoy !.	Kea leboha le ho thabela!.
This was not just a mental picture.	Sena e ne e se feela setšoantšo sa kelello.
We would wait until they fell asleep.	Re ne re tla ema ho fihlela ba robala.
They did so only at night.	Ba ne ba etsa joalo bosiu feela.
The fault lies with me.	Phoso ke ea ka.
We just need to talk to someone.	Re hloka feela ho bua le motho.
Of course he says maybe but he is not sure.	Ha e le hantle o re mohlomong empa ha a na bonnete.
The food is delicious.	Lijo li monate.
But that was another one.	Empa eo e ne e le e 'ngoe.
So be aware of this.	Kahoo hlokomela sena.
People were walking.	Batho ba ne ba tsamaea.
I would not let my children.	Ke ne nke ke ka lumella bana ba ka.
Say that day, you know.	Bolela letsatsi leo, ua tseba.
He will not be guilty in any way.	E ka se be le molato ka tsela efe kapa efe.
The most important thing now was to make them eat again.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa joale e ne e le ho etsa hore ba je hape.
We passed him and sat down.	Re ile ra mo feta ra lula fatše.
However, I do not think you will.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke nahane hore u tla etsa joalo.
You never talk about him.	Ha ho mohla u buang ka eena.
She is also taking care of her husband.	Hape o ntse a hlokomela monna oa hae.
It's really beautiful.	E ntle ruri.
It's going well.	E ntse e tsamaea hantle.
Only they are not.	Feela ha ba joalo.
The need for everything is mine now.	Ho hloka tsohle ke tsa ka hona joale.
Feelings only happen sometimes.	Maikutlo a etsahala feela ka linako tse ling.
Now, why are you here.	Joale, hore na ke hobane'ng ha u le mona.
But it was not about me.	Empa e ne e se ho ea ka.
he wanted to ask.	o ne a batla ho botsa.
Give your time.	Fana ka nako ea hau.
They will have to make sure they say what they say.	Ba tla tlameha ho etsa bonnete ba hore ba bua seo ba se buang.
I need to talk a lot.	Ke hloka ho bua haholo.
But then he too began to forget us.	Empa joale le eena o ile a qala ho re lebala.
I could feel it starting.	Ke ne ke utloa e qala.
You have to watch them.	U tlameha ho li shebella.
I really do not understand what happened.	Ruri ha ke utloisise se etsahetseng.
We do not want to leave this place.	Ha re batle ho tloha sebakeng sena.
As he looks.	Joalo ka ha a shebahala.
Sometimes it is harder than just spending a day.	Ka linako tse ling ho thata ho feta feela ho qeta letsatsi.
The man refused to pay.	Monna eo o ile a hana ho lefa.
We learned.	Re ile ra ithuta.
At night something strange happened.	Bosiu ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang.
I will work on that.	Ke tla sebetsa ho seo.
I do not know how to do it.	Ha ke tsebe ho etsa joang.
It can help others, and it is good.	E ka thusa ba bang, 'me e ntle.
The second time he does so.	Lekhetlo la bobeli o etsa joalo.
Whatever you have, you have it.	Eng kapa eng eo u nang le eona, u na le eona.
She had a headache.	O ne a tšoeroe ke hlooho e bohloko.
But that is not for everyone.	Empa seo ha se sa batho bohle.
I hope you are happy.	Ke tšepa hore u thabile.
I do not want this.	Ha ke batle sena.
That is none of my business.	Seo ha se taba ea ka.
I knew it was you.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ke wena.
He was able to not do that.	O ile a khona ho se etse joalo.
He wanted to get to know her.	O ne a batla ho mo tseba.
It is a wonderful family time.	Ke nako e monate ea lelapa.
So basically nothing.	Kahoo ha e le hantle ha ho letho.
That was probably the worst thing that could have happened.	Mohlomong eo e ne e le ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
Anyway, I have to go back there.	Leha ho le joalo, ke lokela ho khutlela moo.
He was happy.	O ne a thabile.
There was someone.	Ho ne ho e-na le motho.
Her stomach hurts.	Mpa ea hae e bohloko.
It was certain he had not read this.	Ho ne ho na le bonnete ba hore o ne a sa bala ena.
Knowing, in the end, there was nothing he was in you.	Ho tseba, qetellong, ha ho letho leo a neng a le ho lona ho uena.
I can't even eat.	Ha ke khone le ho ja.
You can find anything there.	U ka fumana eng kapa eng moo.
It was very close.	E ne e le haufi haholo.
And so it was.	Mme ho bile jwalo.
A lot of things happen that way.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang ka tsela eo.
But he does not know what they are talking about.	Empa ha a tsebe hore na ba bua ka eng.
It has been a very good way of thinking.	E bile tsela e ntle haholo ea ho nahana.
These times need something else.	Linako tsena li hloka ho hong hape.
He didn't think, he just thought.	O ne a sa nahane, o ile a nahana feela.
So eat and drink.	Kahoo, ja le ho noa.
He is very strong.	O matla haholo.
You have to understand it.	U tlameha ho e utloisisa.
It feels so good.	E ikutloa e le ntle haholo.
But there was no one else around.	Empa ho ne ho se motho e mong haufi.
You pass it.	Ua e feta.
They were still his people.	E ne e ntse e le batho ba hae.
There was none of them now.	Ho ne ho se le e 'ngoe ea tsona joale.
Or with us.	Kapa le rona.
There are many better things for you than anything else.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tse ntle ho uena ho feta eng kapa eng.
I stood in front.	Ke ile ka ema ka pele.
She agreed to take care of the children.	O ile a lumela ho hlokomela bana.
But it was.	Empa ho ne ho le joalo.
However, he could not help but comment.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sitoa ho thusa ho fana ka maikutlo.
However, one has to try.	Leha ho le joalo, motho o lokela ho leka.
You think you know what you want.	U nahana hore u tseba seo u se batlang.
By using only humans.	Ka ho sebelisa batho feela.
What more could you ask for?	U ka batla eng hape?
It was a state of mind.	E ne e le boemo ba kelello.
I know what it is, but that doesn't matter.	Kea tseba hore na ke eng, empa hoo ha ho na taba.
The road was empty.	Tsela e ne e se na batho.
He did not want to leave.	O ne a sa batle ho tsamaea.
This is your chance to pay for it.	Ona ke monyetla oa hau oa ho e lefa.
I just don't do that.	Ke mpa ke sa etse joalo.
I have a lot of danger here.	Ke na le kotsi e ngata mona.
Want to help with dinner?	O batla ho thusa ka lijo tsa mantsiboea?
We decide.	Re etsa qeto.
I knew what was going on.	Ke ne ke tseba se etsahalang.
But it has another benefit.	Empa e na le molemo o mong hape.
He drinks his coffee carefully.	O noa kofi ea hae ka hloko.
I knew nothing.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe letho.
he asked.	a botsa.
We could go anywhere.	Re ne re ka ea kae kapa kae .
Otherwise you will have this all night.	Ho seng joalo u tla ba le sena bosiu bohle.
And, he would get nothing tonight.	Mme, o ne a sa tlo fumana letho bosiung bona.
He will speak only once.	O tla bua hang feela.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
Then he saw another one.	Eaba o bona e mong.
He found nothing.	Ha aa ka a fumana letho.
Nothing was missing.	Ntho e ne e le sieo.
Well, you can always try.	Hantle, u ka leka kamehla.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho tlohela.
The police were about to arrive.	Mapolesa a ne a tla tloha a fihla.
Let's say it happens.	A re re e ea etsahala.
Your first name is mine.	Lebitso la hao pele la ka.
However, there are problems with this method.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le mathata ka mokhoa ona.
It's hard for anyone, maybe.	Ho thata ho mang kapa mang, mohlomong.
It is obviously important.	Ho hlakile hore ke ea bohlokoa.
There is nothing you can say.	Ha ho letho leo u ka le buang.
If you look for it, you will find it.	Ha u ka e batla, u tla e fumana.
I loved her.	Ke ne ke mo rata.
I do not know how.	Ha ke tsebe joang.
Stay here as long as you like.	Robala mona nako e telele kamoo u ratang.
My husband usually does not go out.	Hangata monna oa ka ha a tsamaee.
People thought he wanted it.	Batho ba ne ba nahana hore oa e batla.
Just like yesterday.	Joalo ka maobane.
The truth is that it is for everyone.	'Nete ke hore ke ea motho e mong le e mong.
Think about how you can do that.	Nahana hore na u ka etsa joalo.
The first does not.	Ea pele ha e etse joalo.
I started to cry.	Ke ile ka qala ho lla.
He did not think that he would.	O ne a sa nahane hore o tla etsa joalo.
That will not be easy.	Seo se ka se be bonolo.
Their clothes are very clear.	Liaparo tsa bona li hlakile hantle.
No such situation exists immediately.	Ha ho boemo bo joalo bo teng hang hang.
We saw nothing, we heard nothing.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bona letho, ra utloa letho.
But it was not possible.	Empa e ne e se ntho e ka etsahalang.
We need to talk about things more carefully.	Re lokela ho bua ka lintho ka hloko haholoanyane.
But that 's not your business right now.	Empa ha se taba ea hau hona joale.
It usually starts that way.	Hangata e qala ka tsela eo.
However, he did not consider living alone.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa nahane ho lula sebakeng a le mong.
If you want to spend time alone, go outside.	Haeba u batla ho qeta nako u le mong, tsoela ka ntle.
It was a very strange thing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang haholo.
There was no way this was going to happen.	Ho ne ho se kamoo sena se neng se tla etsahala kateng.
Keep up the good work, man.	Tsoela pele ka mosebetsi o motle, monna.
We will take it one day at a time.	Re tla e nka letsatsi le le leng ka nako.
There was not much I could say.	Ho ne ho se na lintho tse ngata tseo nka li buang.
It can be weird people.	E ka ba batho ba makatsang.
We have to go.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea.
There was no other vehicle visible.	Ho ne ho se koloi e 'ngoe e neng e bonahala.
But this was not the only danger.	Empa ena e ne e se eona feela kotsi.
Finally, someone would come and get him.	Qetellong, ho ne ho tla tla motho ho mo nka.
Why are you visiting?	Ke hobane'ng ha u etela?
Of course, that is not all.	Ehlile ha se taba eo feela.
I took the second route.	Ke ile ka nka tsela ea bobeli.
Well, let me think.	Hantle, e re ke nahane.
You have to do it your way.	O lokela ho etsa ka tsela ya hao.
But that doesn't seem to help.	Empa hoo ha ho bonahale ho thusa.
I have never told anyone about this.	Ha ke so bolelle motho ka taba ena.
You will still need to apply as everyone else.	U ntse u tla hloka ho etsa kopo joalo ka motho e mong le e mong.
There was nothing he could think of to do with his life.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka nahanang ho le etsa ka bophelo ba hae.
The picture continued.	Setšoantšo se ile sa tsoela pele.
Do not eat, just enough to live.	U se ke ua ja, feela ho lekaneng ho phela.
It was very questionable to him.	E ne e botsa haholo ho eena.
And you.	Mme ke wena.
It would not be surprising, no.	E ke ke ea e-ba ntho e makatsang, che.
Moreover, they look very nice.	Ho feta moo, li shebahala li le ntle haholo.
That made it even harder.	Seo se ile sa etsa hore ho be thata le ho feta.
I had to tell someone, anyone.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho bolella motho, mang kapa mang.
Then daily life will seem easier.	Joale bophelo ba letsatsi le letsatsi bo tla bonahala bo le bonolo.
You will learn that you can be hurt.	U tla ithuta hore u ka utloa bohloko.
I do not think so.	Ha ke nahane joalo.
But this was too much for me to understand.	Empa sena se ne se le ngata haholo hore ke se utloisise.
Get an idea of ​​how it works.	Fumana maikutlo a hore na e sebetsa joang.
He started going to it.	O ile a qala ho ea ho eona.
He was always playing, even when he was tired.	O ne a lula a bapala, leha a ne a khathetse.
I started talking to myself like him.	Ke ile ka qala ho bua ke le mong joaloka eena.
It seems to help.	E bonahala e thusa.
There is no time to think now.	Ha ho sa na nako ea ho nahana joale.
It is a method of repair.	Ke mokhoa oa ho lokisa.
It turned out that we did not learn much.	Ho ile ha etsahala hore ebe ha rea ​​ka ra ithuta hakaalo.
Mary begins to cry.	Mary o qala ho lla.
Then they all left.	Eaba bohle ba tsamaea.
At one point, everyone suffered.	Ka nako e 'ngoe, e mong le e mong o ile a utloa bohloko.
We do not know what will happen.	Ha re tsebe se ka etsahalang.
Man and dog.	Motho le ntja.
I did not like to say that.	Ke ne ke sa rate ho bua joalo.
That's it.	Ke taba ena.
Then everyone stood up.	Ebe bohle baa ema.
I would love to be with you.	Ke tla thabela ho ba le wena.
I mean, it was just beautiful.	Ke bolela, e ne e le ntle feela.
They met a man who called.	Ba ile ba kopana le monna ea letsa.
We need you.	Rea u hloka.
There was a serious accident near here.	Ho bile le kotsi e mpe haufi le mona.
He did not want to leave.	O ne a sa batle ho tsamaea.
Maybe he's busy.	Mohlomong o phathahane.
I want to know what he said.	Ke batla ho tseba seo a se buileng.
Moreover, he did not like to talk about things.	Ho feta moo, o ne a sa rate ho bua ka lintho.
No one knows.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang.
But that should not happen.	Empa seo ha sea lokela ho etsahala.
But it was there.	Empa e ne e le teng.
I am here.	ke teng.
The other was a man he would never doubt.	E mong e ne e le motho eo a neng a ke ke a mo belaela.
He calls every day.	O letsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
Sometimes things happen.	Ka linako tse ling ho etsahala lintho tse ling.
It will stay after it stays.	E tla lula ka mor'a hore e lule.
Indeed, the work was extremely difficult for them because of their past lives.	Ka sebele, mosebetsi o ne o le boima haholo ho bona ka lebaka la bophelo ba bona ba nakong e fetileng.
I thought about that for a long time.	Ke ile ka nahana ka seo ka nako e telele.
Because there was water.	Hobane metsi a ne a le teng.
Until they no longer do so.	Ho fihlela ha ba sa hlola ba etsa joalo.
He could not find it.	O ne a ke ke a e fumana.
I want something.	Batla ke batla ho hong.
I think they will find it fun.	Ke nahana hore ba tla e fumana e le monate.
If not for me.	Haeba e se bakeng sa ka.
But it was not going to be easy.	Empa ho ne ho se ho sa tl’o ba le bonolo.
Or for you.	Kapa bakeng sa hao.
They can't stand anything to get what they want.	Ba ke ke ba ema ho letho ho fumana seo ba se batlang.
He got it.	O ile a e fumana.
You help so many kids out there.	U thusa bana ba bangata hakana ka ntle.
They often were.	Hangata ba ne ba le joalo.
I wrote again.	Ke ile ka ngola hape.
And who knows, maybe it is.	Mme ke mang ya tsebang, mohlomong ho jwalo.
He did not want any of that.	O ne a sa batle letho la tseo.
He would know.	O ne a tla tseba.
They had a wonderful first day.	Ba bile le letsatsi la pele le monate.
He can earn more money than I do.	A ka fumana chelete e ngata ho mpheta.
So shouldn’t we be able to.	Kahoo na ha rea ​​lokela ho khona .
And you don't know.	Mme ha o tsebe.
She has a better style.	O na le mokhoa o betere.
But we were really good enough.	Empa re ne re hlile re le hantle ho lekana.
In fact, most people do.	Ha e le hantle, batho ba bangata ba etsa joalo.
Now she wonders why.	Joale oa ipotsa hore na hobaneng.
This is just a suggestion, of course.	Ena ke tlhahiso feela, ehlile.
There is another.	Ho na le e 'ngoe.
Stop right there.	Ema hona moo.
Now let me speak.	Joale e re ke bue.
But instead.	Empa ho e-na le hoo.
That was a very good thing.	Eo e ne e le ntho e ntle haholo.
He probably would not have his own.	Mohlomong o ne a ke ke a ba le ea hae.
The issue was complex enough.	Taba eo e ne e le boima ho lekana.
Nor should they.	Hape ha baa lokela ho etsa joalo.
I did not think he was.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore o joalo.
He told them.	O ile a ba bolella.
Yet no thought came to him.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho mohopolo o ileng oa tla ho eena.
But he seems to like it.	Empa ho bonahala a e rata.
Money is needed.	Ho hlokahala chelete.
I will not be able to reach them for another few hours.	Ha ke sa tla khona ho ba fihlela lihora tse ling tse 'maloa.
Where do you work?	U sebetsa kae?
My child can understand it.	Ngoana a ka e utloisisa.
Walking at night?	Ho tsamaea bosiu?
Without it, you have nothing.	Ntle le eona, ha u na letho.
And so it is.	Mme ho jwalo.
I could not write that book right now.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ngola buka eo hona joale.
He continued to play until the end of his life.	O ile a tsoela pele ho bapala ho fihlela qetellong ea bophelo ba hae.
I hear you now.	Kea u utloa hona joale.
They know they exist.	Baa tseba hore ba teng.
It was delicious.	E ne e le monate haholo.
He never learned if they did it.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ithuta haeba ba e entse.
He played with it.	O ile a bapala ka eona.
It will not be an easy task.	E ke ke ea e-ba mosebetsi o bonolo.
There is nothing in the room.	Ha ho letho ka kamoreng.
I just refuse.	Ke hana feela.
He needed one.	O ne a hloka e mong.
But you know what people are like.	Empa ua tseba hore na batho ba joang.
I can't reach him.	Ha ke khone ho mo fihlela.
After that, he no longer enjoyed school.	Ka mor’a moo, ha aa ka a hlola a thabela sekolo.
Three hours later.	Lihora tse tharo morao.
They learn more.	Ba ithuta ho feta.
No, the news is not good.	Che, litaba ha li monate.
He was very helpful.	O ne a thusa haholo.
He uses water.	O sebelisa metsi.
So people are reading, they are actually reading.	Kahoo batho ba bala, ba hlile ba bala.
Someone else would like to live like that.	Motho e mong a ka rata ho phela jwalo.
But he wanted to.	Empa o ne a batla.
Yes, if only.	E, haeba feela.
Both were very powerful.	Ka bobeli li ne li le matla haholo.
We are with you in this work.	Re na le uena mosebetsing ona.
We just got it.	Re sa tsoa e fumana.
We cannot thank you enough.	Ha re khone ho u leboha ka ho lekaneng.
Every now and then.	Nako le nako.
He can go back to it and try again.	A ka khutlela ho eona ebe o leka hape.
He did it.	O e entse.
That's what we'll talk about when I get back.	Taba eo re tla e bua ha ke khutla.
I hope we get the chance to use it.	Ke tšepa hore re tla fumana monyetla oa ho e sebelisa.
But here's the truth.	Empa 'nete ke ena.
I am a young man.	Ke mohlankana .
This goes both ways, of course.	Sena se tsamaea ka bobeli, ehlile.
There was one first.	Ho ne ho e-na le e 'ngoe ea pele.
However, this did not happen.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha sea ka sa etsahala.
Do well at school today.	Etsa hantle sekolong kajeno.
I don't want you to think that.	Ha ke batle hore o nahane joalo.
The same should apply here.	Se tšoanang se lokela ho sebetsa mona.
He may never see her again.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe o ne a ke ke a hlola a mo bona hape.
I just heard.	Ke utloile feela.
Nobody likes him.	Ha ho motho ea mo ratang.
That may not be enough.	Seo se ka 'na sa se ke sa lekana.
They are very dangerous.	Li kotsi haholo.
We will fix it.	Re tla e lokisa.
As you look tonight.	Joalo ka ha o shebahala bosiung bona.
Same time last year.	Nako e tšoanang selemong se fetileng.
They know nothing about it.	Ha ba tsebe letho ka eona.
I would not expect you to believe it.	Nke ke ka lebella hore u e lumele.
The girl is standing there crying.	Ngoanana eo a ema moo a ntse a lla.
He would be arrested when he saw it.	O ne a tla tšoaroa ha a bona.
That's a good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle eo.
We have to give it time.	Re tlameha ho e fa nako.
I have never loved him.	Ha ke eso mo rate.
I knew nothing.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe letho.
Why me? 	Ke hobane'ng ha 'na?
he thought.	a nahana.
We do not know when.	Ha re tsebe neng.
There is no such thing here, of course.	Haho ntho e kang eo mona, ehlile.
But he actually has the same problem.	Empa ha e le hantle o na le bothata bo tšoanang.
I would go.	Ke ne ke tla tsamaea.
This was our home.	Ena e ne e le ntlo ea rōna.
So it is good to know what you are talking about.	Kahoo ho molemo hore u tsebe seo u se buang.
It will not help.	E ke ke ya thusa letho.
But finding good people takes time.	Empa ho fumana batho ba molemo ho nka nako.
But he had to know better.	Empa o ne a lokela ho tseba hantle.
Make sure you watch the time carefully.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u shebella nako ka hloko.
I would play it a certain way and it happened.	Ke ne ke tla e bapala ka tsela e itseng 'me ho bile joalo.
It no longer does that.	Ha e sa etsa joalo.
It is no longer playing.	Ha e sa hlola e bapala.
Instead, he focused on his life and career.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a nahana ka bophelo ba hae le mosebetsi oa hae.
My father knows the way.	Ntate o tseba tsela.
Tonight this week you must come back to me.	Bosiung bona bekeng ena u tlameha ho khutlela ho 'na.
Good times there.	Linako tse monate moo.
I will not drink too much.	Nke ke ka noa haholo.
He tried and tried and tried.	O ile a leka mme a leka mme a leka.
Is it tasty!	E monate!
Sometimes you just can't help them.	Ka linako tse ling u sitoa ho ba thusa.
What does he look like?	O shebahala joang?
The process of making it is very simple.	Mokhoa oa ho e etsa o bonolo haholo.
He would not say such a thing.	O ne a ke ke a bua ntho e kang eo.
I don't know why this is happening.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hobaneng sena se etsahala.
None of us really knew why.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a hlile a tseba lebaka.
Nothing is going to happen.	Ha ho letho le tlang ho etsahala.
Don't tell anyone.	Se bolelle mang kapa mang.
She has three days.	O na le matsatsi a mararo.
And it works very well.	Mme e sebetsa hantle haholo.
I enjoy you.	Kea u thabela.
There is nothing there.	Haho letho moo.
We look forward to seeing you again.	Re lebeletse ho u bona hape.
Keep your questions up to date.	Boloka lipotso tsa hau ho fihlela ka nako eo.
I no longer feel that way.	Ha ke sa ikutloa joalo.
And they had done so.	Mme ba ne ba entse jwalo.
And you know it.	Mme o a e tseba.
This place made no sense to me.	Sebaka sena se ne se se na kelello ho 'na.
But he got to know her well.	Empa o ile a mo tseba hantle.
She wept bitterly.	A lla ka bohloko.
Unless it was bad.	Ntle le haeba e ne e le mpe.
It is not very easy to do this.	Ha ho bonolo haholo ho etsa sena.
I understood the reason.	Ke ne ke utloisisa lebaka.
What was it, he wondered.	E ne e le eng, a ipotsa.
They're done with you.	Ba qetile ka wena.
And yet.	Mme leha ho le jwalo.
I feel like you are the only one who can know him.	Ke bona eka ke uena motho ea ka mo tsebang.
This can be an emotional time.	Ena e ka ba nako ea maikutlo.
Obviously, this is not the case.	Ho hlakile hore sena hase ntho ea sebele.
There is something wrong with that.	Ho na le phoso ka seo.
If you do, you will find even more information.	Haeba u etsa joalo, u tla fumana litaba tse ngata le ho feta.
Anyone can do the job.	Mang kapa mang a ka etsa mosebetsi.
You may not think much of what we do, but we do.	U ka 'na ua se ke ua nahana haholo ka seo re se etsang, empa rea ​​nahana.
I can't let it go.	Ha ke khone ho e tlohela.
We have been there before.	Re bile teng pele.
She had a child after another.	O ile a ba le ngoana ka mor'a e mong.
But you understand my point.	Empa u utloisisa taba ea ka.
I do not do such things.	Ha ke etse lintho tse joalo.
That is why we love life.	Ke kahoo re ratang bophelo.
I understood you were busy.	Ke ne ke utloisisa hore u phathahane.
They will not buy it.	Ba ke ke ba li reka.
And he was finally able to live a family life.	'Me qetellong o ile a khona ho phela bophelo ba lelapa.
It seems like an easy task but surprisingly not.	Ho bonahala e le mosebetsi o bonolo empa ho makatsang ke hore ha ho joalo.
The danger was real.	Kotsi e ne e le ea sebele.
But that is far from the case.	Empa ho hang ha se 'nete.
It will not seek it any other way.	E ke ke ea e batla ka tsela e 'ngoe.
He decided to stay.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho lula.
That's bad news.	Ke litaba tse mpe.
That is the issue now.	Taba eo ke hona joale.
It will be back soon.	E tla khutlela morao haufinyane.
This is how we do it.	Ena ke tsela eo re e etsang ka eona.
That's a good idea.	Ke mohopolo o motle oo.
I certainly felt that way.	Ka sebele ke ne ke ikutloa joalo.
I could not eat without eating.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ja ntle le ho ja.
I see you do that.	Kea bona hore u etsa joalo.
I like these people here.	Ke rata batho bana ba mona.
It will be a wonderful time !.	E tla ba nako e monate!.
That way, we are kind of a true team.	Ka tsela eo, re mofuta oa sehlopha sa 'nete.
They will wait for you.	Ba tla u emetse.
We understood it.	Re ile ra e utloisisa.
The dog had to stay outside.	Ntja e ile ea tlameha ho lula ka ntle.
Let me see.	E re ke bone.
No one can do it alone.	Ha ho motho ea ka e etsang a le mong.
I will be, too.	Ke tla ba, le nna.
We did well.	Re entse hantle.
I wish I had gone that way.	Eka nka be ke ile ka tsela eo.
They kept the group together.	Ba ile ba boloka sehlopha hammoho.
I don't know what else.	Ha ke tsebe ke eng hape.
He will leave her.	O tla mo tlohela.
Not to mention how much it tells us about you.	Re sa bue ka hore na e re bolella hakae ka uena.
It will never happen again.	Ha e sa tla hlola e etsahala.
They can be good.	Li ka ba molemo.
But that is exactly the point.	Empa ke eona taba eo haholo.
Both of his parents worked.	Batsoali ba hae ka bobeli ba ne ba sebetsa.
But we are still a family.	Empa re ntse re le lelapa.
There is no reason to make this more difficult than it needs to be.	Ha ho na lebaka la ho etsa hore sena se be thata ho feta kamoo se hlokang ho ba kateng.
He felt very strong.	O ile a ikutloa a le matla haholo.
He’s a guy who can ‘do’.	Ke mohlankana ea 'ka etsang'.
he thought.	a nahana.
Of course, not everyone.	Ehlile, ha se bohle.
Until he does not.	Ho fihlela a sa etse jwalo.
I'll tell you what kind of a boy he was.	Ke tla u bolella hore na e ne e le moshanyana oa mofuta ofe.
They bought something with their money.	Ba ile ba reka ho hong ka chelete ea bona.
It is now, too.	Ke hona joale, hape.
The reason for this is actually very simple.	Lebaka la taba ena ha e le hantle le bonolo haholo.
I say yes.	Ke re e ee.
I mean, you have to go back and think about it.	Ke bolela, u tlameha ho khutlela morao 'me u nahane ka eona.
I'm still not talking to any of them.	Ke ntse ke sa bue le e mong wa bona.
How could she forget?	O ne a ka lebala joang?
Learning to live with me will be difficult.	Ho ithuta ho phela le 'na ho tla ba thata.
We were there too.	Le rona re ne re le teng.
However, that is not the case for his career.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo hantle bakeng sa mosebetsi oa hae.
He may try to work his way through.	A ka 'na a leka ho sebetsa ka tsela ea hae.
He had decided.	O ne a entse qeto.
He takes good care of his car.	O hlokomela koloi ea hae hantle.
He considered it not only important but also important.	O ne a nka hore e ne e se ea bohlokoa feela empa e le ea bohlokoa.
We want to do it, so we do it.	Re batla ho e etsa, kahoo rea e etsa.
In fact, they left it at that.	Ha e le hantle, ba ile ba e tlohela.
I will ask you a lot.	Ke tla le botsa haholo.
I was happy for him.	Ke ne ke mo thabetse.
This is not easy.	Sena ha se bonolo.
That is what happened here.	Ke sona se etsahetseng mona.
I am happy today.	Ke thabile kajeno.
However, they do not eat.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ba je.
I wonder if they ever thought that way.	Kea ipotsa hore na ebe ba kile ba re nahana joalo.
He always does this.	O etsa sena kamehla.
And they were there.	Mme ba ne ba le teng.
It was hard to sleep.	Ho ne ho le thata ho robala.
If we can't say it, we don't think much of it.	Haeba re sa khone ho e bolela, ha re nahane haholo ka eona.
More than anything.	Ho feta eng kapa eng.
The food police are also there.	Mapolesa a lijo a teng hape.
You must write it down.	U tlameha ho e ngola fatše.
When arrested, they pleaded not guilty.	Ha ba tšoaroa, ba ile ba re ha ba na molato.
It was painful, but it was good.	E ne e le bohloko, empa e ne e le molemo.
We do not know how to give up.	Ha re tsebe ho tlohela.
I would not do that.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa joalo.
He was asking a lot of questions at the time.	O ne a botsa lipotso tse ngata ka nako eo.
They didn’t care when I looked.	Ba ne ba sa tsotelle ha ke sheba.
People are moving.	Batho ba ntse ba tsamaea.
I hope you start.	Ke tšepa hore o tla qala.
He’s good enough, and he’ll definitely be good enough.	O hantle ho lekana, 'me ka sebele o tla ba hantle ho lekana.
And another.	Le e 'ngoe.
That makes a lot of people.	Seo se etsa hore ho be le batho ba bangata.
More on this year.	Ho feta moo selemong sena.
I don't think it exists.	Ha ke nahane hore e teng.
he asked.	a botsa.
I enjoyed everything.	Ke ne ke thabela ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
And so we do nothing.	'Me kahoo ha re etse letho.
They love him.	Ba mo rata.
It did not take long.	Ha ea ka ea nka nako e telele.
Nothing at all.	Ha ho letho le tsohle.
There is no work that is not essential.	Ha ho mosebetsi oo e seng oa bohlokoa.
I want to be better tomorrow.	Ke batla ho ba betere hosane.
Life is not dangerous here.	Bophelo ha bo kotsi mona.
I'm somewhere.	Ke sebakeng se seng.
If we do not get it now, we will not get it.	Haeba re sa e fumane hona joale, re ke ke ra e fumana.
I think we could be much better.	Ke nahana hore re ka ba betere haholo.
Whether we know it or not, it exists.	Hore na re tseba sena kapa che, se teng.
Surprisingly, it worked.	Ho makatsang ke hore e ile ea sebetsa.
You were there, and you were there.	O ne o le teng, le wena o ne o le teng.
I'm glad he treats her so well.	Ke thabetse hore ebe o mo tšoara hantle.
They were not needed, but he seemed to take them seriously first.	Li ne li sa hlokahale, empa o ne a bonahala a li nka e le tsa bohlokoa haholo pele.
He would not be able to do this.	O ne a ke ke a khona ho etsa sena.
Otherwise, it still works very well.	Ho seng joalo, e ntse e sebetsa hantle haholo.
I see no reason or reason in it.	Ha ke bone lebaka kapa kelello ho eona.
The law exists to this day.	Molao o teng ho fihlela kajeno.
This is another way.	Ho ena ke tsela e 'ngoe.
He looks bad.	O shebahala a le mpe.
There will be a second one.	Ho tla ba le ea bobeli.
He did not think of eating.	O ne a sa nahane ho ja.
Thanks for the feedback though.	Kea leboha ka maikutlo le ha ho le joalo.
Or maybe he just did not know anything about her.	Kapa mohlomong o ne a sa tsebe letho ka eena.
He certainly would not have been able to do that.	Ka sebele o ne a ke ke a khona ho etsa joalo.
He is older than I am.	O moholo ho nna.
It doesn't matter anymore.	Ha ho sa na taba.
It seems important to look for him.	Ho bonahala ho le bohlokoa ho mo batla.
Maybe I don't have much time.	Mohlomong ha ke na nako e ngata.
It was great to see them again.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba bona hape.
Drive carefully, my boy.	Khanna ka hloko, moshanyana oa ka.
However, it probably is not.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong ha se eona.
But he will not be here long.	Empa ha a na ho ba mona nako e telele.
He did not know how.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na joang.
This usually happens with money.	Hangata sena se etsahala ka chelete.
And there was nothing.	Mme ho ne ho se letho.
Very strong.	Matla haholo.
What kind of food do you like?	Ke mofuta ofe oa lijo tseo u li ratang?
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
They work well.	Ba sebetsa hantle.
They are happier now.	Ba thabile ho feta jwale.
But think of this.	Empa nahana ka sena.
We never talk.	Ha ho mohla re buang.
I mean, think about it.	Ke bolela, nahana ka eona.
I love her, you know.	Ke a mo rata, le a tseba.
We will be there when you need us.	Re tla ba teng ha o re hloka.
Wait for more.	Ema tse ling hape.
And really, isn't that the case?	'Me ha e le hantle, na ha se eona taba eo?
He could see that they had it.	O ne a bona hore ba na le eona.
This was fun to write.	Sena se ne se monate ho ngola.
So that's what we did.	Kahoo ke seo re ileng ra se etsa.
It would seem to be useless.	E ne e tla bonahala e se na thuso.
I have no help to call.	Ha ke na thuso ea ho letsetsa.
They often do not seem to find it.	Hangata ho bonahala ba sa e fumane.
I met him there unexpectedly.	Ke ile ka kopana le eena moo re sa mo lebella.
I'm very pleased to meet you.	Ke thabetse ho o tseba.
I think he wanted to.	Ke nahana hore o ne a batla.
Get your money's worth.	Fumana chelete ea hau.
I would go because the whole thing was my imagination.	Ke ne ke tla ea hobane taba eohle e ne e le mohopolo oa ka.
It went on.	E ile ea tsoela pele.
This was my only chance.	Ona e ne e le monyetla oa ka feela.
You do not pretend to be.	Ha u etse eka ha ho joalo.
And, of course,.	'Me, ehlile,.
Not all of them have ever been as healthy as you.	Ha se kaofela ha bona ba kileng ba phela hantle joaloka uena.
And the feeling stayed with him for life.	'Me maikutlo a lula le eena bophelo bohle.
But they did not want money.	Empa ba ne ba sa batle chelete.
I thought about it for the first time.	Ke ile ka e nahana ka lekhetlo la pele.
I will let them in.	Ke tla ba lumella ho kena.
Matters are secondary.	Litaba ke tsa bobeli.
He too wanted to get out.	Le eena o ne a batla ho tsoa.
I do not know how to do that.	Ha ke tsebe ho etsa joalo.
The girl looked down in embarrassment.	Ngoanana a sheba fatše ka lihlong.
I did nothing to them.	Ha kea ba etsa letho.
I know that will be his first thought.	Kea tseba hore oo e tla be e le mohopolo oa hae oa pele.
Sorry if that wasn't enough for you.	Ke masoabi haeba seo ha sea lekana bakeng sa hau.
People will travel to the area someday.	Batho ba tla tsamaea sebakeng ka letsatsi le leng.
Book, maybe.	Buka, mohlomong.
There is only the first if there is a second '.	Ho na le oa pele feela haeba ho na le oa bobeli'.
But he was not.	Empa o ne a se jwalo.
If he does, he will not live.	Haeba a etsa joalo, a ke ke a phela.
He wanted more, more.	O ne a batla ho feta, haholo.
I was really not sure if it was a good thing or not.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ke ntho e ntle kapa che.
It is not surprising.	Ha se ntho e makatsang.
You can finally find them here.	Qetellong u ka li fumana mona.
There was nothing in it about them.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng ho lona le neng le bua ka bona.
It actually allows you to watch what you want and when you want it.	Ha e le hantle e u lumella ho shebella seo u se batlang le ha u se batla.
It is their money.	Ke chelete ea bona.
It was here before.	E bile mona pele.
I'll pay you next week.	Ke tla u lefa bekeng e tlang.
One cannot exist without the other.	E 'ngoe e ke ke ea ba teng ntle le e 'ngoe.
It will definitely stand.	Ruri e tla ema.
You must have been close by.	E tlameha ebe o ne o le haufi.
But we never won one of them.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra hlola e le ’ngoe ea tsona.
But it is not necessary.	Empa ha ho hlokahale.
Yes.	Ee.
That you want does not matter.	Hore o batla ha ho na taba.
I found him to be a very strange man.	Ke ile ka mo fumana e le monna ea makatsang haholo.
However, you should get out of here.	Leha ho le joalo, u lokela ho tloha mona.
A nice person, really.	Motho ea monate, ka 'nete.
Everyone knew it.	E mong le e mong o ne a e tseba.
He was thinking well, and that was good.	O ne a nahana hantle, mme seo se ne se le molemo.
I feel this too from them.	Ke utloa sena le 'na ke tsoa ho bona.
It was the same with me.	Ho bile joalo le 'na.
I have it.	Ke na le eona.
I know there are many others.	Kea tseba hore ho na le ba bang ba bangata.
Her father said he had found a job.	Ntate oa hae o ile a re a fumane mosebetsi.
I used the opportunity to study with her.	Ke ile ka sebelisa monyetla oo ho mo ithuta.
I will not be able to call tomorrow.	Ha ke na ho khona ho letsetsa hosane.
He does not want to go.	Ha a batle ho tsamaea.
We hope you can visit again.	Re tšepa hore u ka etela hape.
He often did not.	Hangata ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
The first is to believe.	Pele ke ho lumela.
He usually went out without breakfast.	Hangata o ne a tsoa a sa ja lijo tsa hoseng.
It did not happen that way.	Ha hoa etsahala ka tsela eo.
There seemed to be a girl.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho na le ngoanana.
It was that easy.	Ho ne ho le bonolo joalo.
.	.
If you really go through this.	Haeba u hlile u feta ka sena.
There is no time to go back.	Ha ho nako ea ho khutlela morao.
He could have gone.	A ka be a ile.
Then they tell me.	Joale baa mpolella.
And it is not yet.	Mme ha ho sa le jwalo.
The child had to leave.	Ngoana o ile a tlameha ho tsamaea.
They were very nice.	Ba ne ba le motle haholo.
So life went on.	Kahoo bophelo bo ile.
It was for another time and another place.	E ne e le bakeng sa nako e 'ngoe le sebaka se seng.
You have to meet him.	U tlameha ho kopana le eena.
No one knows what happened there.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang se etsahetseng moo.
Everyone was making money.	E mong le e mong o ne a etsa chelete.
I do not want to say anything.	Ha ke batle ho bua letho.
That hurts, too.	Hoo ho bohloko, le hona.
They feel powerless.	Ba ikutloa ba se na matla.
There is no such power.	Ha ho matla a joalo.
In fact they do not exist.	Ha e le hantle ha li eo.
Because you have no idea.	Hobane ha o na maikutlo.
It should not continue.	Ha ea lokela ho tsoela pele.
Usually in the evening.	Hangata mantsiboea.
I was human.	Ke ne ke le motho.
However, it was true.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le 'nete.
Not all bad, either.	Ha se ntho e mpe kaofela, le hona.
I finished work.	Ke qetile mosebetsi.
However, there is the issue.	Leha ho le joalo, moo taba.
He can't even right now.	Ha a khone le hona joale hantle.
There is something strange about them.	Ho na le ho hong ho makatsang ka bona.
See how that works in the long run.	Bona hore na seo se sebetsa joang ka nako e telele.
I need to know that you can do that.	Ke hloka ho tseba hore u ka etsa joalo.
It is easy to find this book.	Ho bonolo ho fumana buka ena.
So was I.	Le ’na ke ne ke le joalo.
It didn't work very well.	Ha ea ka ea sebetsa hantle haholo.
But there is more to it than that.	Empa ho na le tse ngata ho feta moo.
I still love the baby.	Ke ntse ke rata ngoana.
No one knows, for nothing like this has ever happened before.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang, hobane ha ho ntho e joalo e kileng ea etsahala pele.
A man is a dangerous thing.	Monna ke ntho e kotsi.
The telephone in the room rang at the same time.	Mohala o ka kamoreng o ile oa lla ka nako e tšoanang.
The same is true of water.	Ho joalo le ka metsi.
You don't do that.	Ha o etse joalo.
I know this.	Ke tseba sena.
But there is more.	Empa ho na le ho hong hape.
Of course, we need both.	Ha e le hantle, re li hloka ka bobeli.
It took up a lot of his time.	Ho ile ha nka nako ea hae e ngata.
Maybe you should stay home today.	Mohlomong u lokela ho lula hae kajeno.
If it is not there, nothing has happened.	Haeba e le sieo, ha ho letho le etsahetseng.
Maybe you want to talk.	Mohlomong o batla ho bua.
Something is wrong here.	Ho na le phoso mona.
They were needed for the job.	Li ne li hlokahala bakeng sa mosebetsi.
You could, but you did not.	U ne u ka khona, empa ha ua ka ua etsa joalo.
You have to have a way out.	U tlameha ho ba le tsela ea ho tsoa.
We will be leaving here soon.	Re tla tloha mona haufinyane.
It is important.	Ke oa bohlokoa.
I know this is the way it is.	Kea tseba hore ena ke eona tsela.
This is enough money to spend.	Ena ke chelete e lekaneng ea ho e sebelisa.
Or he does.	Kapa oa etsa joalo.
I have to go talk to them.	Ke lokela ho ya bua le bona.
He asked her about it.	O ile a mo botsa ka eona.
If they stayed long enough.	Haeba a ile a lula nako e telele ho lekana.
They were all well dressed.	Kaofela ba ne ba apere hantle.
In his way.	Ka tsela ya hae.
However, it does not seem to work.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e bonahale e sebetsa.
And our people.	Le batho ba rona.
I have not thought about that book for years.	Ke lilemo tse ngata ke sa nahane ka buka eo.
These are all good.	Tsena tsohle li ntle.
There would be a time for that, he knew.	Ho ne ho tla ba le nako ya seo, o ne a tseba.
We enjoyed a delicious breakfast together.	Re ile ra thabela lijo tsa hoseng tse monate hammoho.
Not doing the work as it goes on, of course.	Ho se etse mosebetsi ha o ntse o tsoela pele, ehlile.
He did not want to talk.	O ne a sa batle ho bolela.
He kept it simple.	O ile a e boloka e le bonolo.
It is difficult to predict this.	Ho thata ho bolela sena esale pele.
You know, if you feel.	Ua tseba, haeba u ikutloa.
His wife died many years ago.	Mosali oa hae o ile a hlokahala lilemo tse ngata tse fetileng.
Well, he doesn't deny it right.	Hantle, ha a hana hantle.
The victims were the first to return.	Ba neng ba utloile bohloko e bile bona ba pele ba ho khutla.
Her friends saw her too.	Metsoalle ea hae le eona e ile ea mo bona joalo.
I wanted to hear something.	Ke ne ke batla ho utloa ho hong.
Like the last time.	Joalo ka lekhetlo la ho qetela.
It's a little dangerous.	E kotsi hanyane.
That's not my name.	Ha se lebitso la ka leo.
But one of these has to work.	Empa e 'ngoe ea tsena e lokela ho sebetsa.
I know him.	Ke a mo tseba.
It could not be.	E ne e ka se be teng.
We do not understand it, but it is true.	Ha re e utloisise, empa ke ’nete.
They don't like anything else.	Ha ba rate letho le leng.
Another three hours.	Lihora tse ling tse tharo.
He wanted it.	O ile a e batla.
Make sure this time.	Etsa bonnete ba nako ena.
Her hair is wet, too.	Moriri oa hae o metsi, le eena.
They will probably continue to do so for decades, too.	Mohlomong ba tla tsoela pele ho etsa joalo ka lilemo tse mashome, hape.
We had to stand together.	Re ile ra tlameha ho ema hammoho.
I would love to hear more.	Nka thabela ho utloa haholoanyane.
He works very hard.	O sebetsa haholo.
There is no place to do anything.	Haho sebaka sa ho etsa eng kapa eng.
These people have to go.	Batho bana ba tlameha ho tsamaea.
See a doctor, if necessary.	Bona ngaka, haeba ho hlokahala.
Yes, we see other things.	E, re bona lintho tse ling.
I too could not call.	Le 'na ke ne ke sa khone ho letsa.
The children love her.	Bana baa mo rata.
I'm just not going to do it.	Ke mpa ke sa tlo e etsa.
There was nobody there.	Ho ne ho se motho moo.
It works more than anything.	E sebetsa ho feta eng kapa eng.
Think carefully before you buy it.	Nahana ka hloko pele u e reka.
Just for me.	Ho 'na feela.
He could not speak.	O ne a sitoa ho bua.
I had a mistake.	Ke bile le phoso.
So I'm not sure what it does.	Kahoo ha ke tsebe hantle hore na e etsa eng.
But he should not have done anything about it.	Empa o ne a sa lokela ho etsa letho ka hona.
There must be something we can do.	E tlameha ebe ho na le seo re ka se etsang.
However, there was a problem.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le bothata.
I saw it today.	Ke e bone kajeno.
Her father died when she was a child.	Ntate oa hae o ile a hlokahala ha e sa le ngoana.
He loves his high school and he loves his friends.	O rata sekolo sa hae se phahameng mme o rata metsoalle ea hae.
And he did so.	Mme a etsa jwalo.
But that was something that happened.	Empa hoo e ne e le ntho e etsahalang.
Of course, this is nothing new.	Ha e le hantle, sena hase ntho e ncha.
There are many of them.	Ho na le tse ngata ho tsona.
Let others do whatever they say.	Tlohela ba bang ho etsa eng kapa eng eo ba e buang.
I look forward to it.	Kea e lebella.
It took a lot of time, but he was still doing it.	Ho ile ha nka nako e ngata, empa o ne a ntse a etsa joalo.
I can do all that.	Nka etsa tseo tsohle.
One day, he thought.	Ka letsatsi le leng, o ile a nahana.
For a long time, it feels good.	Nako e telele, e ikutloa e le monate.
She looked happy and very beautiful.	O ne a shebahala a thabile a bile a le motle haholo.
You can't predict how things will go.	U ke ke ua bolela hore na lintho li tla tsamaea joang.
The police are asking for help.	Mapolesa a kopa thuso.
They just used him.	Ba ne ba mpa ba mo sebelisa.
So we are very sorry about that.	Kahoo re masoabi haholo ka seo.
I like talking to people.	Ke rata ho bua le batho.
One does not need to know.	Motho ha a hloke ho tseba.
It looks like it but.	E shebahala joalo ka eona empa.
That is often the case.	Hangata ho joalo.
And she was so beautiful.	Mme o ne a le motle haholo.
To enter their place.	Ho kena sebakeng sa bona.
We must get your help to keep it.	Re tlameha ho fumana thuso ea hau ho e boloka.
Whether you love money.	Hore na o rata chelete.
We are no better or worse.	Ha re betere kapa ho feta.
We will help you with that.	Re tla o thusa ka seo.
Nice place.	Sebaka se setle.
So that's why you can't take the money.	Kahoo ke hore u ke ke ua nka chelete.
He made his last book there and goes back.	O ile a etsa buka ea hae ea ho qetela moo 'me o khutlela morao.
Well, sleeping with one of them.	Hantle, ho robala le e mong oa bona.
Where did I tell you.	Ke le boleletse kae.
There was nobody there.	Ho ne ho se motho moo.
I was not sure if you would write again.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na u tla ngola hape.
And it is not often enough that we would expect.	Mme ha se hangata ho lekaneng hoo re neng re ka ho lebella.
He didn't care about the whole thing.	O ne a sa tsotelle taba eo kaofela.
We can do the same.	Le rōna re ka etsa joalo.
Have plenty of food and water.	E-ba le lijo tse ngata le metsi.
I hope this has been helpful.	Ke tšepa hore sena se bile molemo.
You will have to leave here.	O tla tlameha ho tloha mona.
My last night.	Bosiung ba ka ba ho qetela.
But there is no time now.	Empa haho nako jwale.
There is nothing you can do to fix the problem.	Ha ho letho leo u ka le etsang ho lokisa bothata boo.
One of the most important is time.	E 'ngoe ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa ke nako.
The party has never been able to achieve more than these.	Ha ho mohla mokete o kileng oa khona ho fihlela tse ngata ho feta tsena.
I just love her.	Ke mo rata feela.
She sat there, thinking.	A dula moo, a nahana.
Then he spoke again.	Eaba o bua hape.
You can write your opinion whether you like it or not.	U ka ngola maikutlo a hau haeba u a rata kapa che.
Everyone was happy for him.	Bohle ba ne ba mo thabetse.
Also, there was one more often party.	Hape, ho ne ho e-na le e 'ngoe hangata ea mokete.
Also, it is not so good.	Hape, ha e ntle hakaalo.
I left behind him.	Ke ile ka tloha ka mor'a hae.
I did not expect anything.	Ha kea lebella letho.
He lived alone.	O ne a phela a le mong.
He finds travel difficult.	O fumana ho tsamaea ho le boima.
Not us.	Ha se rona.
Things are as bad as they are.	Lintho li mpe joalo ka ha li le joalo.
This rule applies.	Molao ona oa sebetsa.
No problem there either.	Haho bothata le moo.
And we need you here.	Mme re o hloka mona.
I got dressed and went outside.	Ke ile ka apara eaba ke tsoela ka ntle.
But no, that is not the case.	Empa che, ha ho joalo.
You are alive and well.	Ua phela 'me ua ithuta.
Although we continued as before, that was not the case.	Le hoja re ile ra tsoela pele joaloka pele, ho ne ho se joalo.
That’s what our money does.	Ke seo chelete ea rona e se etsang.
It looked like a bone.	E ne e shebahala joaloka bone.
As soon as he arrives, tell him to leave.	Hang ha a fihla, mo bolelle hore a tsamaee.
One thing goes on to do something else.	Ntho e 'ngoe e tsoela pele ho etsa ntho e' ngoe.
She said her son was happy to be back in school.	A re mora oa hae o ne a thabetse ho khutlela sekolong.
I did not know which one.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke efe.
This car is too heavy for the road.	Koloi ena e boima haholo bakeng sa tsela.
If that were the case they would not be able to work.	Haeba ho ne ho le joalo ba ne ba ke ke ba khona ho sebetsa.
He thought this was a good thing.	O ne a nahana hore sena ke ntho e ntle.
Now you do not say.	Joale ha u re.
And he had done just that.	Mme o ne a entse sona seo.
John rode a bicycle to work.	John o ne a sebelisa baesekele ho ea mosebetsing.
The locals love to eat.	Batho ba sebakeng sena ba rata ho ja.
We want to be able to refuse.	Re batla ho khona ho hana.
I will do this again.	Ke tla etsa sena hape.
But they were not, he knew.	Empa ba ne ba se jwalo, o ne a tseba.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
You have no time.	Ha u na nako.
They will find us again this time.	Ba tla re fumana le nakong ena.
He would not take any opportunity.	O ne a sa tlo nka monyetla ofe kapa ofe.
And maybe bigger.	Mme mohlomong e moholo.
It is very important.	E bohlokoa haholo.
It is not as they could not, or as they were not in the past.	Ha se joalo ka ha ba sa khone, kapa joalo ka ha ba ne ba se joalo nakong e fetileng.
Some are good.	Tse ling li ntle.
Obviously she looks good, she's beautiful.	Ho hlakile hore o shebahala hantle, o motle.
But this is not really the case.	Empa sena ha se hlile ha se joalo.
You do everything now.	U etsa tsohle hona joale.
It could have been worse.	E ka be e bile mpe le ho feta.
I can't begin to tell you the value of what you do.	Ha ke khone ho qala ho u bolella bohlokoa ba seo u se etsang.
And it certainly has.	Mme ehlile ho bile jwalo.
But that was not enough.	Empa hoo ho ne ho sa lekana.
People know it.	Batho ba e tseba.
However, wait a minute.	Leha ho le joalo, ema hanyane.
It was painful to speak.	Ho ne ho le bohloko ho bua.
From there it can be useful though.	Ho tloha moo ho ka ba molemo leha ho le joalo.
I know how these things work.	Kea tseba hore na lintho tsena li sebetsa joang.
That is why we will never do it again.	Ke kahoo re sa tlo hlola re e etsa hape.
Thank you for my life too.	Kea leboha ka bophelo ba ka hape.
Don't just live.	U se ke ua phela feela.
That is what happened.	Ke sona se neng se etsahala.
Too much.	Ntho e ngata haholo.
Now who knows.	Joale ke mang ea tsebang.
I do not want anyone to see this.	Ha ke batle ha motho a bona sena.
That child was me.	Ngoana eo e ne e le ’na.
The two were like that long before they met.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba le joalo nako e telele pele ba kopana.
He walks on water.	O tsamaea ka metsi.
He probably will not do that.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe a ke ke a etsa joalo.
But this was good for him.	Empa sena se ne se le molemo ho eena.
It will take you three days.	Ho tla o nka matsatsi a mararo.
This is ignorance of the truth.	Sena ke ho se tsebe 'nete.
I just want him to be my legal father.	Ke mpa ke batla hore e be ntate oa ka oa molao.
Before you can be with someone then.	Pele u ka ba le motho ka nako eo.
But try.	Empa leka.
I know that is important to you.	Kea tseba hore seo se bohlokoa ho uena.
These and similar times were very important.	Linako tsena le tse ling tse tšoanang le tsona e ne e le tsa bohlokoa haholo.
We will all go.	Re tla tsamaea bohle.
I thought he was in me.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o ho nna.
Buy their stuff.	Reka lintho tsa bona.
He could not have both.	O ne a ke ke a ba le tsona ka bobeli.
He wondered now.	A ipotsa jwale.
However, this is usually not a problem.	Leha ho le joalo, taba ena hangata ha se bothata.
It was a very close decision.	E ne e le qeto e haufi haholo.
Your dad is usually away on business.	Hangata ntate oa hao ha a eo ka mosebetsi.
Of course they are not.	Ehlile ha ba joalo.
That is your decision.	Ke qeto ea hao.
It uses something that already exists.	E sebelisa se seng se ntse se le teng.
I have some bad news.	Ke na le litaba tse mpe.
These books look great.	Libuka tsena li shebahala li le ntle.
This was their way.	Ena e ne e le tsela ea bona.
He seemed to understand.	E ne eka oa utloisisa.
Now, it's time to go to bed.	Joale, ke nako ea ho robala.
Whose life would you like to live?	O ka rata ho phela bophelo ba mang?
Find a home.	Batla hae.
No one needs to understand it.	Ha ho hlokahale hore ba bang ba e utloisise.
And it was time.	Mme e ne e le nako.
He treats us very well here.	O re tšoara hantle haholo mona.
Finally, they decided to go.	Qetellong, ba ile ba etsa qeto ea ho tsamaea.
That's a good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle.
I hope he can sleep soon today.	Ke tšepa hore kajeno a ka robala kapele.
I even wondered if.	Ke bile ke ipotsa hore na.
But just for you.	Empa bakeng sa hau feela.
Life is so good.	Bophelo bo monate haholo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Haho phoso mona.
Here are a few of our favorites.	Mona ke tse seng kae tsa tseo re li ratang.
I did not enter the room.	Ha kea ka ka kena ka kamoreng.
She sees her children playing well when they return home.	O bona bana ba hae ba bapala hantle ha ba khutlela hae.
And it worked.	Mme e ile ya sebetsa.
If you have had them, please try this type.	Haeba u kile ua ba le tsona, ka kopo leka mofuta ona.
I am a teacher.	Ke tichere.
He was hurt.	O ile a utloa bohloko.
Well, here he comes, he thought.	Be, ke ena e fihla, a nahana.
Where anything can happen.	Moo eng kapa eng e ka etsahalang.
I did not, no.	Ha kea etsa joalo, che.
No place is so important.	Ha ho sebaka se bohlokoa joalo.
They could have just asked.	Ba ka be ba sa tsoa botsa.
He works there.	O sebetsa moo.
We feel good about it.	Re ikutloa monate ka eona.
Just how he wanted to spend his evening.	Feela kamoo a neng a batla ho qeta mantsiboea a hae.
That seems painful.	Hoo ho bonahala eka ke bohloko.
The first place is hard.	Sebaka sa pele ke se thata.
Of course, it is.	Ha e le hantle, ho joalo.
But they are children.	Empa ke bana.
They look great.	Li shebahala hantle.
I understand you don’t care.	Kea utloisisa hore ha u tsotelle.
She did not tell him anything.	Ha ea ka ea mo bolella letho.
Yes, all of it.	E, kaofela ha eona.
But only one woman.	Empa mosali a le mong feela.
We worked well.	Re ne re sebetsa hantle.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
He could not help anything.	O ne a ke ke a thusa letho.
All of them are important.	Kaofela ha tsona li bohlokoa.
I'm not the only one who can do that.	Ha se nna feela ya ka etsang hoo.
But we probably should not.	Empa mohlomong ha rea ​​lokela.
I can't help her.	Ha ke khone ho mo thusa.
And one more thing.	Le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
We hope it will help you.	Rea tšepa hore e tla u thusa.
No good news, no bad news.	Ha ho litaba tse monate, ha ho litaba tse mpe.
Take it from someone who knows.	E nke ho motho ea tsebang.
Then we will just move on.	Joale re tla tsoela pele feela.
He should never come out again.	Ha aa lokela ho tsoa hape.
I mean to me, it speaks so sorry.	Ke bolela ho 'na, e bua ka masoabi haholo.
This is something that should work in the future.	Ena ke ntho e lokelang ho sebetsa nakong e tlang.
It’s a tough thing though.	Ke ntho e thata leha ho le joalo.
Then the book.	Ebe libuka.
It was very close.	Le ne le le haufi haholo.
I have a husband who is a good father to his children.	Ke na le monna eo e leng ntate ea molemo ho bana ba hae.
Getting what you deserve.	Ho fumana se o lokelang.
And he would come in and ask for that.	Mme o ne a tla kena mme a kopa seo.
There is nothing here for him.	Ha ho letho mona bakeng sa hae.
I will be using them again.	Ke tla be ke li sebelisa hape.
Even too late.	Leha e le morao haholo.
I just had to let it go.	Ke ne ke lokela ho e tlohela feela.
I see real driving power.	Ke bona matla a sebele a ho khanna.
I don't think you like it very much.	Ha ke nahane hore o e rata haholo.
You always know where it is.	U lula u tseba moo e leng teng.
I'm back.	Kea khutla.
Then everything should work as it should.	Joale tsohle li lokela ho sebetsa kamoo li lokelang ho sebetsa kateng.
Make sure the date is there anyway.	Etsa bonnete ba hore letsatsi le teng leha ho le joalo.
He seemed to like it.	O ne a bonahala a e rata.
It will not be easy.	Ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
Yes, indeed.	E, ka sebele.
I feel that they are not.	Ke na le maikutlo a hore ha ba joalo.
You can watch it with your friends.	U ka e shebella le metsoalle ea hau.
The young man needed money.	Mohlankana eo o ne a hloka chelete.
He looked up again.	A sheba hape.
He just needs to keep thinking positively.	O hloka feela ho lula a nahana hantle.
And there it is.	Mme ho teng.
They never do it again.	Ha ba sa hlola ba e etsa hape.
Very good indeed.	E ntle haholo ruri.
Where he will want to go.	Moo a tla batla ho ea.
Food is life.	Lijo ke bophelo.
He wanted them both.	O ne a li batla ka bobeli.
You do not know exactly why.	Ha u tsebe lebaka hantle.
Nobody likes him.	Ha ho motho ea mo ratang.
I was devastated.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko haholo.
One could not live without the other.	E mong o ne a ke ke a phela ntle le e mong.
They are dangerous.	Li kotsi.
It may not work that way.	E ka 'na ea se ke ea sebetsa ka tsela eo.
I was very happy.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo.
I will not leave him there.	Nke ke ka mo tlohela moo.
There will be another.	Ho tla ba le e 'ngoe.
We may not.	Re ka 'na ra se ke ra.
Make sure you have water.	Etsa bonnete ba hore o na le metsi.
I just went to see what was going on.	Ke ne ke ile feela ho ea bona se etsahalang.
No, he did not.	Che, ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
He has been in the past.	O bile teng nakong e fetileng.
He was already working with his hands and arms.	O ne a se a ntse a sebetsa matsoho le matsoho a hae.
I will be strong in the morning.	Ke tla ba matla hoseng.
You go from one group to another and it takes time.	U tsoa sehlopheng se seng ho ea ho se seng 'me ho nka nako.
You will get this in the end.	O tla fumana sena qetellong.
He did well.	O entse hantle.
They were not really my parents.	E ne e hlile e se batsoali ba ka.
As we will now.	Joalo ka ha re tla etsa joale.
This was one way or another.	Ena e ne e le mokhoa o mong kapa o se nang letho.
A whole bunch of them.	Sehlopha sohle sa tsona.
Nice to hear from you.	Ke thabela ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
While he was writing, his wife arrived.	Ha a ntse a ngola, mosali oa hae a fihla.
But all of them did.	Empa kaofela ha bona ba ile ba etsa joalo.
We were always a boy and a girl.	Re ne re le moshanyana le ngoanana ka linako tsohle.
Also, play.	Hape, ho bapala.
There was something new each time, something more difficult.	Ho ne ho na le ntho e ncha nako le nako, ntho e thata ho feta.
But that's not too much.	Empa hoo ha se ntho e ngata haholo.
We want them.	Rea ba batla.
But you have to get back to work.	Empa u tlameha ho khutlela mosebetsing.
Then, finally, it happened.	Joale, qetellong, ho ile ha etsahala.
That does it.	Seo se a e etsa.
Then the first child came out.	Joale ngoana oa pele oa tsoa.
He had decided.	O ne a entse qeto.
But, of course, it is not.	Empa, ha e le hantle, ha se hantle.
I did not plan it.	Ha kea e rera.
It is clear what you have to do.	Ho hlakile hore na u tlameha ho etsa eng.
Are you going to see them?	O ya bona?
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
That is often true.	Seo hangata e leng 'nete.
So they will not do that.	Kahoo ba ke ke ba etsa joalo.
He didn't even have to say it.	O ne a sa tlameha le ho e bua.
And you man.	Le wena monna.
But he did not do the same.	Empa ha aa ka a etsa se tšoanang.
You need to know such things.	U lokela ho tseba lintho tse joalo.
You do not know what a person can learn about him from you.	Ha u tsebe hore na motho a ka ithuta eng ka eena ka uena.
They come and look.	Ba tla mme ba sheba.
They would love to hear from you.	Ba ka thabela ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
Then look for what you are looking for.	Ebe u sheba ntho eo u batlang ho e batla.
I made money and spent money.	Ke ile ka etsa chelete 'me ka sebelisa chelete.
He'll just tell me.	O tla mpolella feela.
I want it to be his.	Ke batla hore e be ea hae.
Tonight was night.	Bosiung bona e ne e le bosiu.
It was clear enough.	E ne e hlakile ho lekana.
He did not care about his clothes or his shoes.	O ne a sa tsotelle liaparo tsa hae kapa lieta tsa hae.
There is no room for doubt.	Ha ho sebaka sa ho belaela.
We just have to try.	Re tlameha feela ho leka.
Perhaps some people still feel the same way today.	Mohlomong batho ba bang ba ntse ba nahana ka tsela e tšoanang le kajeno.
He is for you.	O bakeng sa hao.
I don’t know how they do it.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ba e etsa joang.
We pay.	Rea lefa .
I asked her why she was doing that.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha a etsa joalo.
There is absolutely no chance.	Ho hang ha ho na monyetla.
He did not know how to work.	O ne a sa tsebe ho sebetsa.
They get it.	Ba e fumana.
And now we may not.	'Me joale re ka' na ra se ke ra.
Doing what was needed rather than what was easy.	Ho etsa se neng se hlokahala ho e-na le se neng se le bonolo.
Find a way to apply.	Fumana mokhoa oa ho etsa kopo.
He used to drink a lot.	O ne a tloaetse ho noa haholo.
There is nothing strange about that.	Haho ntho e makatsang moo.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
I will give it a better name.	Ke tla e fa lebitso le betere.
You can be simple.	U ka ba bonolo.
However, future work remains.	Leha ho le joalo, mosebetsi oa nakong e tlang o ntse o le teng.
But he knew too much.	Empa o ne a tseba haholo.
Using this site.	Ho sebelisa sebaka sena.
It tells us nothing.	Ho sa re bolelle letho.
However, her mother says she has a girlfriend for her.	Leha ho le joalo, 'mè oa hae o re o na le ngoanana bakeng sa hae.
Soon everyone will see it too.	Haufinyane bohle ba tla e bona le bona.
So, what will you do?	Joale, u tla etsa joang?
It is a dangerous practice.	Ke mokhoa o kotsi.
It looked like it.	E ne e shebahala joalo ka eona.
I will not speak again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke bua.
It will not be the last of course.	E ke ke ea e-ba ea ho qetela ehlile.
We go back.	Re khutlela morao.
He returned home exhausted.	O ile a khutlela hae a khathetse.
It happens, it exists.	Hoa etsahala, ho teng.
These things are not true.	Lintho tsena hase ’nete.
Something strange is happening here.	Ho na le ntho e makatsang e etsahalang mona.
He did not try to get to know anyone.	Ha a ka a leka ho tseba motho.
It's as simple as that.	Ho bonolo joalo ka seo.
Children learn many things at school.	Bana ba ithuta lintho tse ngata sekolong.
Just get what you can.	Fumana feela seo u ka se khonang.
But at that time they did not have enough money.	Empa ka nako eo ba ne ba se na chelete e lekaneng.
But that will not happen.	Empa seo se ke ke sa etsahala.
Obviously it paid off.	Ho hlakile hore e ile ea lefa.
The worst was yet to come.	Tse mpe ka ho fetisisa li ne li sa tla.
So he was happy.	Kahoo o ne a thabile.
You are working.	U ntse u sebetsa.
Maybe it was nothing.	Mohlomong e ne e se letho.
We were just trying to get through and survive.	Re ne re leka feela ho feta le ho phela.
Please let us go there.	Ke kopa re ee moo.
It is never easy to write that.	Ha ho mohla ho leng bonolo ho ngola seo.
Of course it will happen soon.	Ehlile ho tla etsahala haufinyane.
He knows how to do it now.	O tseba ho e etsa jwale.
I want one of our people.	Ke batla e mong oa batho ba rona.
It will be fun.	Ho tla ba monate.
They did not win much.	Ha baa ka ba hlola haholo.
He arrived after everyone had left.	O ile a fihla ka mor'a hore bohle ba tsamaee.
So just, notice that.	Kahoo feela, hlokomela seo.
I continue to study and write.	Ke tsoela pele ho ithuta le ho ngola.
I have always wanted to go.	Haesale ke batla ho tsamaea.
You have the last meal.	U na le lijo tsa ho qetela.
I, well.	Ke, hantle.
They had the same inheritance.	Ba ne ba e-na le lefa le tšoanang.
It obviously needs money, and money.	Ho hlakile hore e hloka chelete, le chelete.
It's hard for me.	Ho thata ho nna.
As there is no shame at all.	Joalo ka ha ho lihlong ho hang.
He called the doctor.	A letsetsa ngaka.
We did not pass, we passed.	Ha rea ​​ka ra feta, ra feta.
I loved her, I have and I will always have it.	Ke ne ke mo rata, ke na le 'me ke tla lula ke e-na le eona.
He found his time this morning.	O fumane nako ea hae hoseng hona.
So he did not return in the future.	Kahoo ha aa ka a khutlela nakong e tlang.
He did a good job there.	O entse mosebetsi o motle moo.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahalang.
Obviously this is the way.	Ho hlakile hore ena ke eona tsela.
That is why they do what they do.	Ke ka hona ba etsang seo ba se etsang.
It hasn't seen it yet.	Ha e so bone.
He bought an old car.	O ile a reka koloi ea khale.
But it is beautiful.	Empa e ntle.
I don't want to talk anymore.	Ha ke sa batla ho bua hape.
He realized his mistake.	O ile a hlokomela phoso ea hae.
Eventually they moved on.	Qetellong ba ile ba tsoela pele.
People did not recognize him.	Batho ha baa ka ba mo hlokomela.
They are useless, you know.	Ha ba na thuso, ua tseba.
He will work very well.	O tla sebetsa hantle haholo.
Thank you so much to my family.	Ke leboha lelapa la ka haholo.
But this is still simple.	Empa sena se ntse se le bonolo.
But there were problems.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le mathata.
I really enjoyed this.	Ke thabetse sena haholo.
She has a very high opinion of him.	O na le maikutlo a phahameng haholo ka eena.
Several people were arrested.	Batho ba ’maloa ba ile ba tšoaroa.
It will work and will continue to work.	E ea sebetsa 'me e tla tsoela pele ho sebetsa.
Looking for it.	Ho e batla.
That did not last long.	Seo ha sea ka sa nka nako e telele.
It will be the same with these things.	Ho tla ba joalo le ka lintho tsena.
I will be back soon.	Ke tla khutla haufinyane.
I can't predict how many books you will read this year.	Ha ke khone ho bolela esale pele hore na o tla bala libuka tse kae selemong sena.
Except for one thing, he says.	Ntle le mohlomong ntho e le 'ngoe, o re.
Maybe we should talk together.	Mohlomong re lokela ho bua hammoho.
We play with toys.	Re bapala ka lintho tsa ho bapala.
It's you over.	Ke uena ho feta.
Eat your food.	Ja lijo tsa hau.
She could not tell the doctor that.	O ne a sitoa ho bolella ngaka seo.
However, I have one question.	Leha ho le joalo, ke na le potso e le 'ngoe.
My parents, too.	Batsoali ba ka, le bona.
Everyone should stop when they can.	E mong le e mong o lokela ho ema ha a ka fumana monyetla.
You do not eat.	Ha o je.
Maybe they are still doing that.	Mohlomong ba ntse ba etsa joalo.
It goes on and on.	E ntse e tsoela pele.
It was amazing money.	E ne e le chelete e makatsang.
I felt very happy about this.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke thabile haholo ka sena.
Not every week can be the best.	Hase beke e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ka bang molemo ka ho fetisisa.
You don't have to do it.	Ha o a tlameha ho e etsa.
And that's what I need.	Mme ke seo ke se hlokang.
Everyone does their job.	Motho e mong le e mong o etsa mosebetsi wa hae.
But he does not say anything.	Empa ha a bue letho.
It was a great way to spend time together.	E ne e le tsela e ntle ea ho qeta nako re le hammoho.
This is an amazing idea.	Ena ke mohopolo o makatsang.
I do many things for you.	Ke u etsetsa lintho tse ngata.
He was powerless.	O ne a sena matla.
Stay close.	Dula haufi.
I will decide tomorrow.	Ke tla etsa qeto hosane.
Then look around you.	Ebe u sheba haufi le uena.
It works all the time.	E sebetsa nako le nako.
Say what you want about it.	Bolela seo u se batlang ka eona.
You do not want comments.	Ha u batle maikutlo.
With that I finish.	Ka seo kea qeta.
You just cried.	U qeta ho lla.
It had a head.	E ne e na le hlooho.
They love it here.	Ba e rata mona.
House by house is.	Ntlo ke ntlo ke.
Still, he really loved her.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a hlile a mo rata.
For a long time he remained the same.	Ka nako e telele o ile a lula a le joalo.
It was great for writing.	E bile motho e moholo ho ngola.
Of course he told me about it.	Ehlile o ile a mpolella ka eona.
He did not understand what had happened.	O ne a sa utloisise se etsahetseng.
We have many questions.	Re na le lipotso tse ngata.
It's time to call for help.	Ke nako ea ho letsetsa thuso.
They live hard.	Ba lula ka thata.
No simultaneous production.	Ha ho tlhahiso ea nako e le 'ngoe.
We'll get to that.	Re tla fihla ho seo.
Maybe there really was something here.	Mohlomong ho ne ho hlile ho na le ho hong mona.
Real work, whatever it was.	Mosebetsi oa sebele, eng kapa eng eo e neng e le eona.
They are my friends.	Ke metsoalle ea ka.
I knew such things would not happen.	Ke ne ke tseba hore lintho tse joalo li ke ke tsa etsahala.
I have to get there.	Ke tlameha ho fihla moo.
It did not work.	Ha ea sebetsa.
Maybe one day it will happen.	Mohlomong ka letsatsi le leng ho tla etsahala.
For the first time.	Lekhetlo la pele.
He was gone now.	O ne a ile jwale.
I told them everything.	Ke ile ka ba bolella ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
Very good indeed.	E ntle haholo ruri.
This is something that will help over time.	Ena ke ntho e tla thusa ho feta ha nako e ntse e ea.
To keep your house.	Ea ho boloka ntlo ea hau.
Mostly, my wife would say.	Haholo, mosali oa ka o ne a tla re.
He lives near this place.	O lula haufi le sebaka sena.
There is no question about that.	Haho potso ka seo.
Very easy to operate.	Ho bonolo haholo ho sebetsa.
It took several hours to get there.	Ho nkile lihora tse 'maloa ho fihla moo.
Only one man.	Ke monna a le mong feela.
We opened the door.	Re ile ra bula lemati.
At some point.	Ka nako e itseng.
When they find out their mistake they will try again.	Ha ba fumana phoso ea bona ba tla leka hape.
You can talk about it if you want.	U ka bua ka eona haeba u batla.
I can't do it.	Ha ke khone ho e etsa.
Of course not, of course.	Ehlile ha a joalo, ehlile.
I will move on with my life.	Ke tla tsoela pele ka bophelo ba ka.
Of course, he did not see anyone.	Ehlile, ha a ka a bona motho.
I did not know.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe.
Everything worked fine last night.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e sebetsa hantle bosiung bo fetileng.
He had been reading it for a long time.	E ne e se e le khale a e bala.
Let's assume there is one.	A re nke hore ho na le e 'ngoe.
That is, in a way, very good news.	Ke hore, ka tsela e itseng, litaba tse monate haholo.
You can usually live without telling your parents everything.	Hangata u ka khona ho phela ntle le ho bolella batsoali ba hao ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
I will go to the party and have a good time.	Ke tla ea moketeng 'me ke be le nako e monate.
But they are there.	Empa ba teng moo.
It's not that we don't like it.	Ha se hore ha re o rate.
Then, finally, finally.	Ebe, qetellong, qetellong.
However, he really enjoyed it.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a e thabela haholo.
However there is no legal code.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho na molao oa molao.
Not much he wants here.	Hase haholo seo a se batlang mona.
But we finally got home.	Empa qetellong re ile ra fihla hae.
He knew exactly what that would mean.	O ne a tseba hantle hore na seo se ka bolela eng.
It's not life for you.	Ha se bophelo ho uena.
I like things like this.	Ke rata lintho tsa mofuta ona.
But now they just can't talk about it anymore.	Empa joale ha ba sa khona ho bua ka eona feela.
I'm glad you will be with me.	Ke thabela hore ebe o tla ba teng le nna.
I know it's not easy to know.	Kea tseba hore ha ho bonolo ho tseba.
That's wrong.	Ke phoso.
They lived together for the rest of their lives.	Ba ile ba phela hammoho bophelo bohle ba bona.
He has a family.	O na le lelapa.
I would like to know more about this.	Ke kopa ho tseba haholoanyane ka sena.
However, that is not the case here.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se taba eo mona.
That was bad enough.	Seo se ne se le mpe ho lekana.
I think it will be a very good thing.	Ke nahana hore e tla ba ntho e ntle haholo.
One of us, now.	E mong oa rona, joale.
He wants to see what happens.	O batla ho bona ho etsahala eng.
We would only see something like this.	Re ne re tla bona ntho e kang ena feela.
But you first.	Empa uena pele.
Time seems to pass.	Ho bonahala eka nako ea feta.
He just stared.	O ile a sheba feela.
I had seen it in me.	Ke ne ke e bone ho nna.
Currently, his wife is not there.	Hona joale, mosali oa hae ha a eo.
I want to do that too.	Le nna ke batla ho etsa seo.
He loved his people and they loved him.	O ne a rata batho ba hae mme le bona ba mo rata.
I think this will help him a lot.	Ke nahana hore sena se tla mo thusa haholo.
I need to know everything.	Ke hloka ho tseba tsohle.
You may find it useful to read them.	U ka li fumana li le molemo ho li bala.
That's how they looked at us.	Ke kamoo ba ileng ba re sheba kateng.
We will never know.	Re ke ke ra tseba.
This looks really fun.	Sena se bonahala se le monate haholo.
He walked with the dog for a long time.	O ile a tsamaea le ntja nako e telele.
Call if there is anything you need.	Letsetsa haeba ho na le eng kapa eng eo u e hlokang.
It didn't look fun.	E ne e sa bonahale e le monate.
Are you sure you would like to do so?	Na u na le bonnete ba hore u ka rata ho etsa joalo?
Ask why they do or do not want to do everything.	Botsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba batla kapa ba sa batle ho etsa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
We could have done that.	Re ka be re entse seo.
Then we will eat.	Joale re tla ja.
So it uses energy.	Ka hona e sebelisa matla.
Maybe someone will try it.	Mohlomong motho e mong o tla e leka.
I am very happy for myself.	Ke thabile haholo bakeng sa ka.
She's so close now.	O haufi haholo jwale.
Maybe people just take it for granted.	Mohlomong batho ba nka feela hore ha se taba ea bona.
If it's a good night, we can go.	Haeba e le bosiu bo monate, re ka tsamaea.
But he soon realized that he could not.	Empa kapele o ile a hlokomela hore a ke ke a khona.
That's a lot of money.	Ke chelete e ngata haholo eo.
No one else is going to fix it.	Ha ho motho e mong ea tla e lokisa.
Wear only one.	Apara e le 'ngoe feela.
People want to help you.	Batho ba batla ho o thusa.
Also, we bring some bad news.	Hape, re tla le litaba tse mpe.
I am reading this now.	Ke ntse ke bala sena hona joale.
All my things are gone.	Lintho tsa ka kaofela li ile.
No, it is a very difficult question to ask.	Che, ke potso e thata haholo ho e botsa.
But it certainly will not be.	Empa ka sebele ha ho sa tla ba joalo.
If you did a good job, he would tell you.	Ha o entse mosebetsi o motle, o ne a tla o bolella.
Ask what is new, what we need to know.	Botsa hore na ke eng e ncha, eng kapa eng eo re lokelang ho e tseba.
They will make a decision.	Ba tla nka qeto.
Are you with us?	O na le rona?
Today is a wonderful and wonderful day for us.	Kajeno ke letsatsi le monate le monate ho rona.
And it doesn't have to be logical.	'Me ha ho hlokahale hore e be le kelello.
To me he will be a man.	Ho nna e tla ba monna.
I am very happy and thankful.	Ke thabile haholo kea leboha.
It plays well.	E bapala hantle.
But we are here.	Empa re teng.
Your people.	Batho ba hao.
I am sure this one will look like a great opportunity to him.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ona o tla shebahala joalo ka monyetla o moholo ho eena.
The boy looked at her.	Moshanyana a mo sheba.
They know nothing, really.	Ha ba tsebe letho, ruri.
I met you.	Ke kopane le uena.
He was very happy.	O ne a thabile haholo.
It comes right after us.	E tla hantle ka mora rona.
The children go to school.	Bana ba ea sekolong.
It was difficult to walk.	Ho ne ho le boima ho tsamaea.
Well, he was the one who really took the money.	Hantle, ke e mong ea ileng a nka chelete ka sebele.
Each time, it was my fault that I was so close.	Nako le nako, e ne e le phoso ea ka hore ke be haufi haholo.
As long as they have something, it's theirs.	Ha feela ba ena le ntho e itseng, ke ya bona.
We are good friends.	Re metsoalle e molemo.
It works in another way too.	E sebetsa ka tsela e 'ngoe hape.
He did not think.	O ne a sa nahane.
It may or may not appear.	E ka bonahala kapa che.
We are in this room.	Re ka kamoreng ena.
I heard crying.	Ke ile ka utloa ho lla.
It's really simple.	E hlile e bonolo.
The good news is that it is not necessary.	Litaba tse monate ke hore ha ho hlokahale.
It's just, that's right.	Ho joalo feela, ho joalo.
I was not drinking.	Ke ne ke sa noa.
I love everything in its place.	Ke rata ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe sebakeng sa eona.
It just happened on time.	E bile teng feela ka nako.
You know it now.	Le a e tseba jwale.
We have to look at that first and foremost.	Re tlameha ho sheba seo pele le ho feta.
It was dangerous to stand in this place.	Ho ne ho le kotsi ho ema sebakeng sena.
We are working hard.	Re etsa mosebetsi o boima.
What he is does not know him.	Seo a leng sona ha se mo tsebe.
They are not ashamed.	Ha ba na lihlong.
We must keep it that way.	Re lokela ho e boloka e le joalo.
I had to have some.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho ba le tse ling.
I thought that was great.	Ke ne ke nahana hore seo se setle haholo.
It doesn't seem to be the case anymore.	Ho bonahala eka ha ho sa le joalo.
It was very early in the morning.	E ne e le hoseng haholo.
However, it was very fun.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bile monate haholo.
Then he returned.	Eaba oa khutla.
It was I who had the problem.	E ne e le 'na eo a neng a e-na le bothata.
There was nothing of that here.	Ho ne ho se letho la seo mona.
People finally understand what we are doing.	Qetellong batho ba utloisisa seo re se etsang.
Please see.	Ka kopo bona.
Whether or not.	Hore na kapa che.
He continued to walk.	O ile a tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
I can no longer live here.	Ha ke sa khona ho lula mona.
This is my last one.	Ena ke ea ka ea ho qetela.
Lots of things were coming.	Lintho tse ngata li ne li tla.
It's not just my business.	Ha se taba ea ka feela.
He refused to admit that he had a problem.	O ile a hana ho lumela hore o na le bothata.
Also, just because it wasn’t my type of book.	Hape, hobane feela e ne e se mofuta oa ka oa buka.
He looked at his phone.	A sheba mohala oa hae.
Then he heard nothing more.	Eaba ha aa ka a utloa letho hape.
No child with her.	Ha ho ngoana ea nang le eena.
We certainly do.	Ruri re etsa joalo.
We will find him.	Re tla mo fumana.
So be careful.	Kahoo hlokomela.
We know it will always be new.	Rea tseba hore e tla lula e le ncha.
I looked at him, not sure what he was talking about.	Ke ile ka mo sheba, ke sa tsebe hantle hore na o ne a bua ka eng.
But he understood things.	Empa o ne a utloisisa lintho.
He just had to think.	O ne a tlameha ho nahana feela.
It means something.	E bolela ho hong.
It was already on the ground.	E ne e se e le fatše.
You have to go get some of that job.	U tlameha ho ea fumana tse ling tsa mosebetsi oo.
Last year, it would not have been so.	Selemong se fetileng, ho ka be ho se jwalo.
They do not know what is good and what is bad.	Ha ba tsebe se setle le se seng ntle.
He did a great job here.	O entse mosebetsi o motle mona.
I went there last week.	Ke ile moo bekeng e fetileng.
You are saying.	U ntse u re.
I have to go through this to the end.	Ke tlameha ho feta ho sena ho fihlela qetellong.
Very close to her.	Haufinyane haholo haufi le hae.
But now we know why.	Empa joale rea tseba hore na ke hobane’ng.
I tried them again.	Ke ile ka li leka hape.
It is necessary to consider only the first.	Hoa hlokahala ho nahana ka ea pele feela.
But he said we would meet with him.	Empa o itse re tla kopana le nna.
As a result, we all felt better.	Ka lebaka leo, kaofela ha rōna re ile ra ikutloa re le betere.
If he did, it worked.	Haeba a ne a etsa joalo, e ile ea sebetsa.
The child cannot.	Ngoana ha a khone.
Clearly, the situation is continuing.	Ho hlakile hore boemo bo ntse bo tsoela pele.
You will not be able to do this kind of thing.	U ke ke ua khona ho etsa ntho ea mofuta ona.
They don't need it.	Ha ba o hloke.
So that's one chance.	Kahoo ke monyetla o le mong.
Too many people.	Batho ba bangata haholo.
I've seen things.	Ke bone lintho.
I am at work.	Ke mosebetsing.
She is beautiful with children.	O motle ka bana.
He knew such things.	O ne a tseba lintho tse joalo.
This is a fix.	Sena ke ho lokisa lintho.
Heavy drinking.	Ho noa haholo.
Do not go swimming alone!	U se ke ua ea sesa u le mong!
She said she was happy for him.	A re o mo thabetse.
You don't stay here, you see, of course.	Ha u lule mona, ua bona, ha e le hantle.
It works better, his father said.	Ho sebetsa hantle ho betere, ntate oa hae o itse.
I know that and you know it.	Ke tseba seo mme o tseba seo.
However, they do not see well.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ba bone hantle.
It's just not that easy.	Ho mpa ho se bonolo hakaalo.
This is a lot of money.	Ena ke chelete e ngata haholo.
Eat whatever you like at the time.	Ja eng kapa eng eo u e ratang ka nako eo.
They want you to know how much they love you.	Ba batla hore u tsebe hore na ba u rata hakae.
What it is or where it is, he cannot say.	Hore na ke eng kapa hore na e hokae, a ke ke a bua.
No one.	Ha ho motho.
And he fell in love with her.	Mme a mo rata.
But it has never been that way.	Empa ha ho mohla ho leng ka tsela eo.
No one saw him.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo bona.
Spend the day with us !.	Qeta letsatsi le rona!.
You do not have to apply for it.	Ha ua tlameha ho e etsa kopo.
People who were there at the time.	Batho ba neng ba le teng ka nako eo.
I know we do.	Kea tseba hore re etsa joalo.
They would pay with their lives.	Ba ne ba tla lefa ka bophelo ba bona.
The police knew him well.	Mapolesa a ne a mo tseba hantle.
However, my friends were even worse.	Leha ho le joalo, metsoalle ea ka e ne e le mpe le ho feta.
He is not the one we are talking about.	Ha se eena eo re buang ka eena.
He is not important here.	Ha se eena ea bohlokoa mona.
So that's kind of good.	Kahoo ke mofuta o motle.
Keep this path clear.	Boloka tsela ena e hlakile.
She is that woman.	Ke mosali eo.
But the truth is even more important.	Empa 'nete ke ea bohlokoa le ho feta.
It is his job.	Ke mosebetsi oa hae.
I hope he doesn't get it.	Ke tšepa a ke ke a e fumana.
It's very heavy, isn't it?	E boima haholo, na ha ho joalo?
Still, I felt that this was the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke utloa eka ena ke eona taba eo.
And what I really like.	Le seo ke se ratang haholo.
Why are you here?	Ke hobane'ng ha u le mona?
He did not need to say anything.	O ne a sa hloke ho bua letho.
When you arrive, you will be late!	Ha u fihla, u tla be u se u le morao!
Maybe he didn’t need to be here for this.	Mohlomong o ne a sa hloke ho ba mona bakeng sa sena.
He felt tired.	O ile a ikutloa a khathetse.
I love being with her.	Ke rata ho ba le eena.
I just had a great time.	Ke bile le nako e monate feela.
He was already looking for her again.	O ne a se a ntse a mo batla hape.
It had been empty for years now.	E ne e se e le lilemo tse ngata joale e se na letho.
I want more than a wife and mother.	Ke batla ho feta mosali le mme.
I almost do it, before I think of anything better.	Ke batla ke e etsa, pele ke nahana ka ho hong ho betere.
Some important people will be there.	Batho ba bang ba bohlokoa ba tla be ba le teng.
Thanks for asking.	Kea leboha ka ho botsa.
You have them in place.	U na le tsona sebakeng.
People often ask you for directions.	Hangata batho ba o botsa tsela.
I have another question I need to ask you.	Ke na le potso e 'ngoe eo ke lokelang ho u botsa eona.
You can't be with him.	U ke ke ua ba le eena.
The house had a nice space.	Ntlo e ne e e-na le sebaka se setle.
I did not like this at all.	Ke ne ke sa rate sena ho hang.
There is nothing you can do.	Ha ho letho leo o ka le etsang.
Yet they can work hard at it.	Empa leha ho le joalo ba ka sebetsa ka thata ho eona.
But it was.	Empa ho ne ho le jwalo.
A group may have only one type.	Sehlopha se ka ba le mofuta o le mong feela.
It was not difficult.	Ho ne ho se thata.
I will write them.	Ke tla li ngola.
He was always happy.	O ne a lula a thabile.
And all your money.	Le chelete ea hau kaofela.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
We can't find our way home.	Ha re khone ho fumana tsela ea ho khutlela hae.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka seo.
We both knew why.	Ka bobeli re ne re tseba lebaka.
People considered me lonely.	Batho ba ne ba nka hore ke bolutu.
He kept some very simple hours.	O ile a boloka lihora tse ling tse bonolo haholo.
It would have been night.	E ka be e bile bosiu.
It was not a catch.	E ne e se ho tšoara.
Maybe even more.	Mohlomong le ho feta.
I want to talk about it.	Ke batla ho bolela ka eona.
He wants us to know him.	O batla hore re mo tsebe.
Most people understand this.	Batho ba bangata ba utloisisa sena.
However, that is clearly not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho hlakile hore ha se eena.
It was the state of his life.	E ne e le boemo ba bophelo ba hae.
But now he can, almost, get started.	Empa joale o khona, hoo e batlang e le, ho qala.
I wonder which one.	Kea ipotsa hore na ke ofe.
And, of course, we got very close.	Mme, ha e le hantle, re ile ra ba haufi haholo.
No need to ask if.	Ha ho hlokahale ho botsa hore na haeba.
I can offer that.	Nka fana ka seo.
That's the only reason he was here.	Ke lona feela lebaka le entseng hore a be teng mona.
It was not difficult to find someone.	Ho ne ho se thata ho fumana motho.
I have both for a few years now.	Ke na le bobeli ka lilemo tse 'maloa joale.
That is, there is something wrong with that.	Ke hore, ho na le phoso ka seo.
It's a group of feet.	Ke sehlopha sa maoto.
The children love her.	Bana ba mo rata.
That you will never do that.	Hore ha ho mohla u tla etsa joalo.
He didn't have that last year.	O ne a sena seo selemong se fetileng.
We will go back.	Re tla khutlela morao.
He was there.	O ne a le teng.
It's just getting them.	Ke ho fumana bona feela.
Her father was reading a book.	Ntate oa hae o ne a bala buka.
Our handiwork was waiting for us when we arrived.	Mosebetsi oa rona oa matsoho o ne o emetse ha re fihla.
He speaks like a schoolboy.	O bua joalo ka ngoana oa sekolo.
They seem to be moving on with it.	Ho bonahala eka ba ntse ba tsoela pele ka eona.
Nobody there had a real chance to get a job.	Ha ho motho moo ea neng a e-na le monyetla oa sebele oa ho fumana mosebetsi.
Some ideas were even more important.	Maikutlo a mang e ne e le a bohlokoa le ho feta.
The name is all.	Lebitso ke tsohle.
That was necessary.	Tseo li ne li hlokahala.
I can't.	Ha ke khone.
All of us can.	Kaofela ha rōna re ka khona.
We have to have one or the other.	Re tlameha ho ba le e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe.
Yes, we were there.	E, re ne re le teng.
You have to take that opportunity.	O lokela ho nka monyetla oo.
Of course, both of these things are not true.	Ha e le hantle, lintho tsena ka bobeli ha se 'nete.
This is the only way.	Ena ke eona feela tsela.
Should it be right?	E lokela ho ba hantle?
And the weight does not seem to be a problem to him.	'Me boima ha bo bonahale e le bothata ho eena.
You’re thinking about him, aren’t you?	U ntse u nahana ka eena, na ha ho joalo?
I had to get it, though.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho o fumana, leha ho le joalo.
You must have had a difficult week.	E tlameha ebe o bile le beke e boima.
I think this is a good idea.	Ke nahana hore ona ke mohopolo o motle.
I will come with you.	Ke tla tla le uena.
However, there is a possibility.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le monyetla.
I know the way.	Ke tseba tsela.
I'm crying too.	Le 'na kea lla.
We have never had a situation like this before.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra ba le boemo bo kang bona.
I have always lived there.	Haesale ke lula moo.
That's what he did all his life.	Ke seo a se entseng bophelo bohle ba hae.
Three were bad, one was good.	Tse tharo li ne li le mpe, e ’ngoe e ne e le molemo.
He said he would get it.	O itse o tla e fumana.
Not many did.	Ha se ba bangata ba e entseng.
There are many more.	Ho na le tse ling tse ngata.
I tried to keep going.	Ke ile ka leka ho tsoela pele.
I decided to try to be better at my job.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho leka ho ba betere mosebetsing oa ka.
He did very well.	O entse hantle haholo.
I decided to call.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho letsa.
I can't help her.	Ha ke khone ho mo thusa.
You need to come up with a better idea.	O hloka ho tla le mohopolo o betere.
Now I'm glad to see them back.	Joale ke thabile ho fumana ba khutla.
He would never visit that place again.	O ne a ke ke a hlola a etela sebaka seo hape.
And so it is, very much so.	'Me ho joalo, haholo.
You need to have some now.	U lokela ho ba le tse ling hona joale.
That makes the whole question less important.	Seo se etsa hore potso ena kaofela e se be ea bohlokoa.
Good for you and me.	Se molemo ho nna le wena.
Of course it was clear.	Ehlile ho ne ho hlakile.
Of course, there are many others who do amazing work.	Ho hlakile hore ho na le ba bang ba bangata ba etsang mosebetsi o makatsang.
Even if you are not.	Leha o se jwalo.
Times are good.	Linako li ntle.
It is no longer what it used to be.	Ha e sa le kamoo e neng e le kateng.
I was just enjoying watching them.	Ke ne ke ntse ke thabela ho ba shebella feela.
Be the first to have.	E-ba oa pele oa ho ba le.
I could not.	Ke ne ke sa khone.
No, kind of.	Che, mofuta oa.
Same with me.	E tšoanang le 'na.
Then everyone does.	Joale bohle ba etsa joalo.
Here is what he says.	Ke sena seo a se buang.
He is all to them.	O tsohle ho bona.
They want him to leave and you can see it.	Ba batla hore a tsamaee 'me u ka e bona.
That's what I love.	Ke seo ke se ratang.
I know it too.	Le nna ke a tseba.
Of course, that would be a good thing.	Ha e le hantle, seo e ka 'na ea e-ba ntho e ntle.
And you can tell me what happened.	Mme o ka mpolella se etsahetseng.
I only saw him once.	Ke mo bone hang feela.
He took along books to study.	O ile a tsamaea le libuka tseo a neng a tla ithuta tsona.
Some have done this before.	Ba bang ba entse sena pele.
He never wanted them to see.	Le ka mohla o ne a sa batle hore ba bone.
We go, we call, we speak.	Rea ea, rea letsa, rea bua.
They both had a hard day.	Ka bobeli ba bile le letsatsi le boima.
As for all the others.	Ha e le ba bang kaofela.
I'm sorry for what he did.	Ke utloile bohloko ka seo a se entseng.
Even from you.	Leha ho tsoa ho uena.
This is true for everyone.	Sena ke 'nete ho motho e mong le e mong.
It takes well.	Ho nka hantle.
I mean, it wasn't.	Ke bolela, ho ne ho se jwalo.
Just let it go.	Ho e tlohela feela.
Being there with friends.	Ho ba moo le metsoalle.
He opened the front door.	A bula lemati le ka pele.
This is all we can do.	Sena ke sohle seo re ka se etsang.
It can't happen.	E ke ke ea etsahala.
Good team here, good team here.	Sehlopha se setle ka mona, sehlopha se setle ka mona.
It is hard to believe that most people would agree with that statement!	Ho thata ho lumela hore batho ba bangata ba ka lumela seo!
Sometimes it did.	Ka linako tse ling e ne e etsa joalo.
It was very painful.	E ne e utloa bohloko haholo.
If you want, please eat.	Haeba u batla, ke kopa u je.
He did not like to play.	O ne a sa rate ho bapala.
You are trying to feel better about yourself.	U leka ho ikutloa betere ka uena.
So we do that.	Kahoo re etsa joalo.
This too is hardly true.	Taba ena le eona ha ho bonolo hore e be 'nete.
This is for kids.	Ena ke ea bana.
That is not his decision.	Seo ha se eena ea lokelang ho etsa qeto.
We could not continue.	Re ne re sitoa ho tsoela pele.
Such a man.	Monna ea joalo.
He is progressing a bit.	O ntse a tsoela pele hanyane.
Keep going because what else can you do.	A 'na a tsamaea hobane ke eng hape eo u ka e etsang.
All is yes or no.	Tsohle ke e kapa che.
Instead, go with me.	Ho e-na le hoo, tsamaea le 'na.
We spend a lot of time with them.	Re qeta nako e ngata le bona.
This was very simple.	Sena se ne se le bonolo haholo.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
That's a very good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle haholo.
I don't think they should.	Ke nahana hore ha ba a lokela.
Things looked very good.	Lintho li ne li shebahala hantle haholo.
Or the first one.	Kapa ea pele.
That's all.	Ho joalo feela.
However, it is very difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, ho thata haholo.
The fall occurred when they called for help.	Ho oa ho ile ha etsahala ha ba letsetsa thuso.
I really did not want to know.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa batle ho tseba.
You can get help faster than in the past.	U ka fumana thuso kapele ho feta nakong e fetileng.
I could not tell you why.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho u bolella lebaka.
There is something strange about all of this.	Ho na le ho hong ho makatsang ka tsena tsohle.
We want to be tough.	Re batla ho ba thata.
You can no longer win.	U ke ke ua hlola.
I am not a danger to anyone.	Ha ke kotsi ho mang kapa mang.
She is fine without him.	O phela hantle ntle le eena.
There is no time to cry.	Ha ho nako ea ho lla.
He had his whole family.	O ne a e-na le lelapa la hae kaofela.
And according to the law.	Le ho ya ka molao.
It used to get worse.	E kile ea e-ba mpe le ho feta.
If you go with the question think of the type.	Haeba u tsamaea le potso nahana ka mofuta.
I continued.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele.
They would be looking for him now.	Ba ne ba tla be ba mo batla hona joale.
This is an important opportunity.	Ona ke monyetla oa bohlokoa.
That's good stuff.	Ke lintho tse ntle.
He needs money.	O hloka chelete.
I could say a lot.	Ke ne ke khona ho bolela haholo.
She thanked him profusely for his help.	O ile a mo leboha haholo ka thuso ea hae.
Whether it is a party or not.	Hore na ke mokete kapa che.
They had a son.	Ba ne ba e-na le mora.
I have never told anyone.	Ha ke eso bolelle motho.
I said nothing again.	Ha kea ka ka bua letho hape.
This is very simple.	Sena se bonolo haholo.
He was innocent.	O ne a se na molato.
She was devastated when she heard the news.	O ne a utloile bohloko haholo ha a utloa litaba tseo.
I like the mind.	Ke rata kelello.
Maybe some will like things like this.	Mohlomong ba bang ba tla rata lintho tsa mofuta ona.
They did not look happy.	Ba ne ba sa bonahale ba thabile.
He had no power at all.	O ne a se a se na matla a letho.
So, time is of the essence, too.	Ka hona, nako ea nako e bohlokoa, hape.
Not a good idea.	Ha se mohopolo o motle.
You can stay as long as you want.	U ka lula nako e telele kamoo u batlang.
Neither is he.	Leha e le eena.
It is difficult to know.	Ho thata ho li tseba.
He knew about these things, though.	O ne a tseba ka lintho tsena, leha ho le joalo.
A heavy day needs a delicious dinner.	Letsatsi le boima le hloka lijo tsa mantsiboea tse monate.
We are not like that here.	Ha re joalo mona.
There was something he had to do first.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho e ’ngoe eo a neng a lokela ho e etsa pele.
But you must know.	Empa u tlameha ho tseba.
And we should.	Mme re lokela.
She has no dog.	Ha a na ntja.
Many of them worked well.	Tse ngata tsa tsona li ile tsa sebetsa hantle.
The reason is very simple.	Lebaka le bonolo haholo.
And he loved that idea.	Mme o ne a rata mohopolo oo.
You know how this happens and why.	Ua tseba hore na sena se etsahala joang le hore na ke hobane'ng.
I would like to.	Nka thabela ho.
This is really very simple.	Sena se hlile se bonolo haholo.
One we have seen.	E 'ngoe re e bone.
You may not need them all.	U ka 'na ua se ke ua li hloka kaofela.
So, very much so.	Kahoo, haholo.
What is happening here is very important.	Se etsahalang mona se bohlokoa haholo.
He finally thought he had found it.	Qetellong a nahana hore o e fumane.
He went to work and did his job.	O ile a ea mosebetsing mme a etsa mosebetsi oa hae.
I'd like to have a good night's sleep.	Ke kopa ho robala hantle bosiu.
He was really trying.	O ne a hlile a leka.
I was just trying it out first.	Ke ne ke qala ho e leka pele.
This is a great place.	Ena ke sebaka se setle.
I will never play you again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke u bapala.
He ate well.	O ne a ja hantle.
Asking something legally.	Ho botsa ntho ka molao.
I just wonder.	Kea ipotsa feela.
I would be happy to help.	Nka thabela ho thusa.
If something happens, it happens.	Haeba ntho e etsahala, e etsahala.
We will both be there.	Re tla be re le teng ka bobeli.
Who did this?	Ke mang ea entseng see?
She looked beautiful.	O ne a bonahala a le motle.
Good job.	Mosebetsi o motle.
You have to stay home.	U lokela ho lula hae.
No, he continued reading.	Che, o ile a tsoela pele ho bala.
Coming here often?	Ho tla mona hangata?
However, many people continue to do so.	Leha ho le joalo, batho ba bangata ba tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
If he knows what to do, he should tell us.	Haeba a tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa, o lokela ho re bolella.
Apparently the pain was intense.	Ho bonahala bohloko bo ne bo le matla.
I'm very tired now.	Ke khathetse haholo hona joale.
Consider getting a craft.	Nahana ka ho fumana mosebetsi oa matsoho.
And she is his mother.	Mme ke mme wa hae.
It is a very simple matter.	Ke taba e bonolo haholo.
To them it was obvious.	Ho bona ho ne ho hlakile.
I was looking forward to the party.	Ke ne ke lebeletse mokete.
Just watching us.	Ho re shebella feela.
We had it before, and we can have it again.	Re ne re e-na le eona pele, 'me re ka ba le eona hape.
You must leave now.	O lokela ho tloha jwale.
It was close now.	E ne e le haufi jwale.
Is there a way to do that.	Na ho na le mokhoa oa ho etsa joalo.
He had a chance.	O bile le monyetla.
It's hard to believe it was just a week ago.	Ho thata ho lumela hore e ne e le beke feela e fetileng.
Certainly not the first group.	Ehlile ha se sehlopha sa pele.
He is one of the people.	Ke e mong oa batho.
He did just my night.	O entse bosiu ba ka feela.
Let's talk about the current situation.	A re ke re bue ka taba ea hona joale.
Probably a lot.	Mohlomong e ngata.
He did not know that it was morning.	O ne a sa tsebe hore e ne e le hoseng.
In and out like that.	Ho kena le ho tsoa joalo.
And you know why.	Mme o tseba lebaka.
He's coming here now.	O tla mona hona jwale.
This type is very simple.	Mofuta ona o bonolo haholo.
It was a painful time indeed.	Ruri e ne e le nako e bohloko.
I want to see your work.	Ke batla ho bona mosebetsi oa hau.
But in reality, he does not know what he wants.	Empa ha e le hantle, ha e tsebe seo e se batlang.
I was too good for any man.	Ke ne ke le motle haholo bakeng sa monna ofe kapa ofe.
However, most people do not like this.	Leha ho le joalo, batho ba bangata ha ba rate sena.
He didn't have to.	O ne a sa tlameha.
But this is a strange thought.	Empa ena ke mohopolo o makatsang.
It was an amazing week.	E ne e le beke e makatsang.
You have been alone for long enough.	U bile u le mong nako e telele ho lekana.
I do not know how he felt about it.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o ne a ikutloa joang ka taba eo.
Bring your own if necessary.	Tla le ea hau ha ho hlokahala.
I can keep talking.	Ke khona ho tsoela pele ho bua.
She looked like she could cry.	O ne a shebahala eka a ka lla.
Soon, they will come to you.	Haufinyane, ba tla tla ho wena.
She is your wife now.	Ke mosali oa hao hona joale.
You will work alone.	U tla sebetsa u le mong.
Not many, but some.	Ha se tse ngata, empa tse ling.
He certainly knew.	Ka sebele o ne a tseba.
Obviously there is something it wants.	Ho hlakile hore ho na le seo e se batlang.
I had no books.	Ke ne ke se na libuka.
Maybe I just didn’t think.	Mohlomong ke ne ke sa nahane feela.
But that is how this happened.	Empa ke tsela eo sena se ileng sa etsahala ka eona.
Try to fix it.	Leka ho e lokisa.
he asked.	a botsa.
I mean, you can get it.	Ke bolela, o ka e fumana.
I got a job.	Ke fumane mosebetsi.
I trusted him.	Ke ne ke mo tšepa.
They will need a place to stay.	Ba tla hloka sebaka sa ho dula.
He was like that.	O ne a le joalo.
He thought he should not be alone.	O ile a nahana hore ha aa lokela ho ba mong.
I paid for it.	Ke ile ka mo lefa eona.
But it's fun.	Empa ho monate.
I do not understand.	Ha ke utloisise.
It can't be.	E ka se be jwalo.
He never lived with a child or a mother.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a lula le ngoana kapa 'mè.
But find out what you can do.	Empa fumana seo u ka se khonang.
You are a better man.	O monna ya betere.
But in all, no.	Empa ho tsohle, che.
Soon we will be there!	Haufinyane re tla be re le teng!
We had time.	Re ne re e-na le nako.
But that was still good news.	Empa tseo e ne e ntse e le litaba tse monate.
He would not do what he does.	O ne a sa tlo etsa seo a se etsang.
Not too late.	Hase morao haholo.
I don't want to see this happen.	Ha ke batle ho bona sena se etsahala.
I don't have time to talk too much.	Ha ke na nako ea ho bua haholo.
It means something is wrong.	Ho bolela hore ho na le ho phoso.
It is a thought, nothing more.	Ke mohopolo, ha ho letho hape.
People would begin to think of her as strange.	Batho ba ne ba tla qala ho nahana ka eena e le ea makatsang.
Because for these, we need people.	Hobane bakeng sa tsena, re hloka batho.
That's all.	Tsohle ke tsona tseo.
Find out more this way.	Fumana tse ling ka tsela ena.
Maybe you can reach the end of your day.	Mohlomong u ka fihla qetellong ea letsatsi la hao.
Then it will be your turn to help.	Joale e tla ba nako ea hao ea ho thusa.
It will continue to do you good.	E tla tsoela pele ho u etsetsa lintho tse molemo.
But both happened.	Empa ka bobeli li ile tsa etsahala.
But they were clearly happy.	Empa ho hlakile hore ba ne ba thabile.
I still have a lot of questions.	Ke ntse ke e-na le lipotso tse ngata.
You are not dangerous.	Ha u kotsi.
Everyone expects them to do it.	E mong le e mong o lebeletse hore ba e etse.
A little.	Hanyane.
He did not like the place.	O ne a eso rate sebaka seo.
However, this was all he could tell them.	Leha ho le joalo, sena e ne e le sohle seo a neng a ka ba bolella sona.
Thank you so much !.	Ke leboha haholo!.
In a strange way of speaking.	Ka tsela e makatsang ya ho bua.
But he thinks that they should not be.	Empa o nahana hore ba ne ba sa lokela ho ba joalo.
My life would be empty without this call.	Bophelo ba ka bo ka be bo se na letho ntle le mohala ona.
All we can do is do the best we can.	Seo re ka se etsang feela ke ho etsa mosebetsi o motle oo re ka o etsang.
I know someone who knows what I've always wanted.	Kea tseba hore ho na le motho ea tsebang seo esale ke se batla.
It always did.	E ne e etsa joalo kamehla.
You can see that.	O ka bona seo.
He was glad to see them all eating.	O ne a thabetse ho bona bohle ba ja.
He returned immediately.	O ile a khutla kapele.
He suggested that they do so, and do so immediately.	O ile a etsa tlhahiso ea hore ba etse joalo, ’me ba etse joalo kapele.
I'm fine.	Ke phela hantle.
Think hard here.	Nahana haholo mona.
You read it well.	U e bala hantle.
My legs open.	Maoto a ka a bula.
It was so much fun to be home, she told us.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo ho ba hae, o ile a re bolella.
His worth is evident to all.	Bohlokoa ba hae bo bonahala ho bohle.
I want to work with you.	Ke batla ho sebetsa le uena.
That was very simple.	Seo se ne se le bonolo haholo.
Nothing happened and he did nothing.	Ho ne ho se letho le etsahetseng mme o ne a sa etse letho.
I'll go with you if you don't mind.	Ke tla tsamaea le uena haeba u sa tsotelle.
She felt happy for the first time since the accident.	O ile a ikutloa a thabile ka lekhetlo la pele ho tloha kotsi eo.
We refused, and they left.	Re ile ra hana, eaba baa tsamaea.
How we should live.	Kamoo re lokelang ho phela kateng.
I'm thinking of calling.	Ke nahana ho letsetsa.
I have to get help.	Ke tlameha ho fumana thuso.
All these questions.	Lipotso tsena kaofela.
I am not the same as my father.	Ke 'na ea sa kang a lekana le ntate.
And, it does not need energy.	Mme, ha e hloke matla.
Plan to visit her.	Rera ho mo etela.
He has many of them.	O na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
To keep friends.	Hore re lule re le metsoalle.
The man was doing wonderful things.	Monna eo o ne a etsa lintho tse makatsang.
We make it our own.	Re e etsa ea rona.
However, it was.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le joalo.
It's my car.	Ke koloi ea ka.
Like coffee.	Joalo ka kofi.
Any of those.	Leha e le efe ya tseo.
The coffee was very good.	Kofi e ne e le ntle haholo.
I wondered where you went.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na u ile kae.
It can meet better.	E ka kopana betere.
Can we?	Na re ka khona.
Do it quickly and carefully.	E etse kapele le ka hloko.
That was a good job.	Oo e ne e le mosebetsi o motle.
I believe your best years are ahead of you.	Ke lumela hore lilemo tsa hau tse ntle li ka pele ho uena.
They are not easy to read.	Ha li bonolo ho li bala.
Everyone loved him.	Bohle ba ne ba mo rata.
That's exactly right.	Hoo ke ho lekana hantle.
He likes to travel.	O rata ho tsamaea.
They did not have enough food.	Ba ne ba se na lijo tse lekaneng.
No one knew where.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tseba moo.
I needed people around me, regular people.	Ke ne ke hloka batho ba haufi le nna, batho ba kamehla.
They feel some things more strongly.	Ba utloa lintho tse ling ka matla ho feta.
House to house.	Ntlo le ntlo.
He wanted that very much.	O ne a batla seo haholo.
You're very fine, man.	O hantle haholo, monna.
Too much for an issue.	E ngata haholo bakeng sa taba.
He did not know how he did this.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na o entse sena joang.
You know, keep trying.	Ua tseba, tsoela pele ho leka.
And one more thing.	Le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I want to do a lot of things.	Ke batla ho etsa lintho tse ngata.
But somehow that doesn't help.	Empa ka tsela e itseng seo ha se na thuso.
The time had come.	Nako eo e ile ea fihla.
I certainly did that for him for many years.	Ka sebele ke ile ka mo etsetsa seo ka lilemo tse ngata.
He had his question.	O ne a e-na le potso ea hae.
I can use that in the classroom.	Nka sebelisa seo ka phaposing.
He also did not eat.	Le eena o ne a sa je.
Both of them.	Ka bobeli ba bona.
He ate dinner last night.	O ile a ja lijo tsa mantsiboea maobane bosiu.
We sleep a lot.	Re robala haholo.
These bad foods made us weak.	Lijo tsena tse mpe li ile tsa re qeta matla.
There are too many people.	Ho na le batho ba bangata haholo.
He certainly would not have stayed.	Ruri a ka be a sa ka a dula.
I will pay you whatever you want.	Ke tla o lefa eng kapa eng eo o e batlang.
It is not just money.	Ha se chelete feela.
I knew what he could do and he came up with it.	Ke ne ke tseba seo a ka se etsang mme o ile a tla le sona.
There was something about seeing this time.	Ho ne ho ena le ho hong ka ho bona nako ena.
Maybe he doesn't even know about you.	Mohlomong le eena ha a tsebe ka uena.
But they refused.	Empa ba ile ba hana.
The children were our friends.	Bana e ne e le metsoalle ea rōna.
I really had no reason.	Ke ne ke hlile ke se na lebaka.
It was really too much.	E ne e hlile e le ngata haholo.
This was a house.	Ena e ne e le ntlo.
A few things are very important.	Lintho tse 'maloa tsa bohlokoa haholo.
Then he begins to wonder.	Ka nako eo o qala ho ipotsa.
However, problems remain.	Leha ho le joalo, mathata a ntse a le teng.
Professional at work.	Setsebi mosebetsing.
He had a wonderful time.	O bile le nako e monate.
She doesn't know.	Ha a tsebe.
Their daily lives are not easy.	Bophelo ba bona ba letsatsi le letsatsi ha bo bonolo.
The French told them about us.	Sefora se ile sa ba bolella ka rona.
Of course there are many.	Ha e le hantle ho na le tse ngata.
Their family did not do such things.	Lelapa la bona le ne le sa etse lintho tse joalo.
I ask this of you.	Ke kopa sena ho uena.
He will be back soon.	O tla khutla haufinyane.
Now, mentally.	Jwale, ka kelello .
This is not necessarily a bad thing.	Sena ha se hakaalo hore ke ntho e mpe.
Power and matter.	Matla le taba.
I would like some water.	Ke kopa metsi.
I feel it too.	Le 'na kea li utloa.
That he needed her more.	Hore o ne a mo hloka ho feta.
I can't sit still.	Ha ke khone ho lula.
I began to feel it.	Ke ile ka qala ho e utloa.
I could understand very well.	Ke ne ke khona ho utloisisa haholo.
He had certain things.	O ne a e-na le lintho tse itseng.
And we get nothing.	Hape ha re fumane letho.
For the first time, you understand what thinking is.	Ka lekhetlo la pele, u utloisisa hore na ho nahana ke eng.
I know it's dangerous.	Kea tseba hore ho kotsi.
He nodded to them.	A ba kopa ka hlooho.
The same is true of him.	Ho joalo le ho eena.
I always thought that was very fun.	Kamehla ke ne ke nahana hore seo se monate haholo.
To many, it seems to be the same today.	Ho ba bangata, ho ntse ho bonahala ho le joalo le kajeno.
I just need to write it down.	Ke hloka feela ho e ngola.
And he departed.	Mme a tloha.
It looks good on the outside, very nice.	E shebahala e le ntle ka ntle, e ntle haholo.
I saw it and did not give up.	Ke ile ka e bona mme ha kea ka ka e tlohela.
He learned many things from his father.	O ile a ithuta lintho tse ngata ho ntate oa hae.
I did not drink at all.	Ke ne ke sa noa ho hang.
They may leave.	Ba ka 'na ba tsamaea.
Now there is a question about it.	Hona joale ho na le potso ka eona.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
I do not want to give anything away.	Ha ke batle ho fana ka letho.
Then leave the room.	Ebe o tloha ka phaposing.
That's how he'll see it.	Ke kamoo a tla e bona kateng.
I was devastated.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko haholo.
Otherwise it is just weird!	Ntle ho moo ke ntho e makatsang feela!
What ever.	Eng kapa eng.
She did not think what had happened to her.	O ne a sa nahane hore na ho etsahetse’ng ka eena.
This is not just about you.	Sena se ka se bue ka uena feela.
Each time, he tried.	Nako le nako, o ne a leka.
to you.	ho uena.
Try again.	Leka hape.
To be a mother.	Ho ba mme.
Could they not think differently?	Na ba ne ba sa khone ho nahana ka tsela e 'ngoe?
I need money.	Ke hloka chelete.
You do not know where you are going with this.	Ha u tsebe hore na u ea kae ka sena.
I love it and I believe you will love it.	Kea e rata 'me ke lumela hore u tla e rata.
But what do you think?	Empa u nahana joang?
He told us he would come.	O re boleletse hore o tla tla.
But it was not yet his name.	Empa e ne e e-so be lebitso la hae.
We both arrived on time.	Ka bobeli re ile ra fihla ka nako.
There are things you can do, to make things better.	Ho na le lintho tseo u ka li etsang, ho etsa hore lintho li be betere.
I asked who he was.	Ke ile ka botsa hore na ke mang.
Decide what you think is important.	Etsa qeto ea seo u nahanang hore ke sa bohlokoa.
I have never been.	Ha ke eso be teng.
It still needs to mean something.	E ntse e hloka ho bolela ho hong.
All for one.	Tsohle bakeng sa 'ngoe.
She is a big girl.	Ke ngoanana e moholo.
Some from them.	Ba bang ho tsoa ho bona.
The same thing.	Ntho e le 'ngoe eo.
He would not thank her, whatever she did.	O ne a sa tlo mo leboha, eng kapa eng eo a e entseng.
So, my girl, that's the way we're going to do it tomorrow.	Ka hona, ngoanana oa ka, ke tsela eo re tla e etsa hosane.
This is a very good thing.	Ena ke ntho e ntle haholo.
The man continued.	Monna eo o ile a tsoela pele.
And you were alone.	Mme o ne o le mong.
It's been that way all my life.	Ho bile joalo bophelo bohle ba ka.
It's a lot harder than people think, you know.	Ho thata haholo ho feta kamoo batho ba nahanang, ua tseba.
All the time.	Ka linako tsohle.
They do not have enough money to buy a house.	Ha ba na chelete e lekaneng ea ho reka ntlo.
As a family.	Joalo ka lelapa.
I needed this today.	Ke ne ke hloka sena kajeno.
Everything else is playing.	Tse ling tsohle li ntse li bapala.
I have never been there before.	Ha ke eso be teng pele.
We do bad things.	Re etsa lintho tse bohloko.
If you don’t like it, that’s my hard point.	Haeba u sa e rate, ke taba ea ka e thata.
Again.	Hape.
I never thought he would do it again.	Ke ne ke sa nahana hore o tla e etsa hape.
This works well.	Sena se sebetsa hantle.
You may even hear it.	U ka ba ua e utloa.
I needed to get home.	Ke ne ke hloka ho fihla hae.
It could be his if.	E ka ba tsa hae haeba .
I am no longer a man.	Ha ke sa le monna.
It sat and sat.	Ya dula mme ya dula.
Finally, decide what you want to see.	Qetellong, etsa qeto ea hore na u batla ho bona eng.
What it will do is help your strength.	Seo e tla se etsa ke ho thusa matla a hau.
Thank you for being here.	Kea leboha ha u le mona.
I wouldn’t say it could happen, of course.	Ke ne nke ke ka re ho ka etsahala, ehlile.
She was crying.	O ne a ntse a lla.
Stop talking now!	Tlohela ho bua hona joale!
He is certain that he is still alive.	O na le bonnete ba hore o ntse a le teng.
He's been here before.	O bile mona pele.
But he can see it.	Empa a ka o bona.
I wonder if we have never thought about it before.	Kea ipotsa hore na ha ho mohla re kileng ra nahana ka eona pele.
You are in pain.	U na le bohloko.
And she is learning.	Mme o a ithuta.
It just stayed with one thought.	E ile ya dula feela ka mohopolo o le mong.
I asked them.	Ke ile ka ba botsa.
His father was a librarian.	Ntate oa hae e ne e le setsebi sa libuka.
He would have to prepare the place well as time went on.	O ne a tla tlameha ho lokisa sebaka hantle ha nako e ntse e feta.
He met his wife.	O ile a kopana le mosali oa hae.
And it must happen soon.	'Me e tlameha ho etsahala haufinyane.
I've seen this.	Ke bone sena.
All my friends are here.	Metsoalle ea ka kaofela e teng mona.
He had them.	O ne a na le tsona.
Just sit, sit, sit.	Lula feela, lula, lula.
He usually does nothing.	Hangata ha a etse letho.
Her clothes are out of style.	Liaparo tsa hae ha li na mokhoa.
I love you for it.	Ke u rata bakeng sa eona.
I really like being with her.	Ke hlile ke rata ho ba le eena.
Eventually he finds them again.	Qetellong oa li fumana hape.
However, we are still there.	Leha ho le joalo, re ntse re le teng.
We have this.	Re na le sena.
But that is not the case with most of us.	Empa ha ho joalo ho ba bangata ba rona.
I can't get out of here.	Ha ke khone ho tloha mona.
You have to go and not come back.	U tlameha ho tsamaea 'me u se ke ua khutla.
He took her.	O ile a mo nka.
Still, it looked fun.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e shebahala e le monate.
I will never do it again.	nke ke ka hlola ke etsa jwalo.
He will not enter.	A ke ke a kena.
He is very dangerous indeed.	O kotsi haholo ruri.
He certainly could.	Ka sebele o ne a ka khona.
Or if you do.	Kapa haeba u etsa joalo.
No comment on that, sorry.	Ha ho na maikutlo ka seo, masoabi.
None of it worked.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea eona e ileng ea sebetsa.
I see somebody tonight.	Ke bona motho bosiung bona.
We were in it together now.	Re ne re le ho eona hammoho joale.
That work begins today.	Mosebetsi oo o qala kajeno.
I say nothing.	Ha ke bue letho.
It certainly is.	Ka sebele ho joalo.
Then go home to sleep.	Joale ho ea hae ho ea robala.
Someone is looking for a job.	Motho o batla mosebetsi.
Do not tell anyone that you are out.	U se ke ua bolella mang kapa mang hore ua tsoa.
Yes, he did.	E, o ile a etsa joalo.
We do it with our human friends, too.	Re e etsa le metsoalle ea rona ea batho, hape.
I wonder who it might be.	Kea ipotsa hore na e ka ba mang.
Yes, for life.	E, bakeng sa bophelo bohle.
He said he needed time to think about it.	O ile a re o hloka nako ea ho nahana ka eona.
I continued to get a chance to say anything.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele pele a fumana monyetla oa ho bua letho.
It will never be a problem again.	Ha a sa tla hlola a eba bothata.
Work with him.	Sebetsa le eena.
I think this can help.	Ke nahana hore sena se ka thusa.
Only time will tell.	Ke nako feela e tla bolela.
I do not want.	Ha ke batle.
Don't do it!	U se ke ua e etsa!
I really did, it was fun for them.	Ke hlile ke etsa joalo, ho ne ho le monate ho bona.
But don’t expect me to understand.	Empa u se ke ua lebella hore ke utloisise.
Anything you want is here.	Eng kapa eng eo u batlang ho e batla e teng mona.
However, that is no longer the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho sa le joalo.
School is important.	Sekolo se bohlokoa.
You have no idea what you just did.	Ha u tsebe seo u sa tsoa se etsa.
He had to make sure.	O ne a lokela ho etsa bonnete.
The hands were bare.	Matsoho a ne a le feela.
It was so.	Ho ne ho le joalo.
More than that you have this.	Ho feta moo o nang le hona.
Even that would probably not work.	Leha seo mohlomong se ka be se sa sebetsa.
They feel good.	Ba ikutloa ba le monate.
I should have let him go his own way.	Ke ne ke lokela hore ebe ke ile ka mo tlohela hore a nke tsela ea hae.
Tom is a big boy.	Tom ke moshanyana e moholo.
I know you did some of that.	Kea tseba u entse tse ling tsa tseo.
I can find something I can do.	Nka fumana se seng seo nka se etsang.
I believe it will not work.	Kea lumela hore e ke ke ea sebetsa.
It works well.	O sebetsa hantle.
None of that would matter.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea eona e neng e tla ba le taba.
I just want to go.	Ke batla ho tsamaea feela.
I have to go.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
They will be here.	Ba tla ba mona.
He was talking about her near us last night.	O ne a bua ka eena haufi le rona bosiung bo fetileng.
It made it easy.	E entse hore e be bonolo.
There was nothing.	Ho ne ho se na letho.
The current one is still working.	Ea hona joale e ntse e sebetsa.
People have their own time period.	Batho ba na le nako ea bona ea nako.
Like, real.	Jwalo ka, ya sebele.
He did not know exactly what he was doing.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle seo a se etsang.
I couldn’t do it as well as he did.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e etsa hantle joaloka eena.
It could not start.	E ne e ke ke ea qala.
Your place is in us.	Sebaka sa hau se ho rona.
He was strong.	O ne a le matla.
Then your friends.	Ebe metsoalle ea hau.
And that would be another statement.	'Me hoo e ka ba ho bua ho hong.
They were easy enough.	Li ne li le bonolo ho lekana.
But tonight he was not.	Empa bosiung bona o ne a se jwalo.
I did not know the man.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe monna eo.
I did not ask and he did not tell me.	Ha kea ka ka botsa mme ha a ka a mpolella.
Maybe it will work.	Mohlomong e ka sebetsa.
Where did he go? 	O ile kae?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
It fell asleep.	Eona e ile ea robala.
The simplest is just to ask.	E bonolo ka ho fetisisa ke ho botsa feela.
Like yours and mine.	Joalo ka ea hau le ea ka.
We don't want to look like that.	Ha re batle ho shebahala jwalo.
Use less, save more.	Sebelisa hanyane, boloka ho feta.
She is beautiful and strong.	O motle o matla.
I think they still have it.	Ke nahana hore ba ntse ba e-na le eona.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
he wonders.	oa ipotsa.
I'm glad of that.	Ke thabetse seo.
They had time.	Ba ne ba ena le nako.
He wanted to be close.	O ne a batla ho ba haufi.
As a child, she was very shy.	Ha e sa le ngoana, o ne a le lihlong haholo.
Yes, we treated him well.	Ho joalo, re ile ra mo tšoara hantle.
But the fun has just begun.	Empa monate o sa tsoa qala.
I need your help.	Ke kopa thuso ea hau.
When you eat, eat.	Ha u ja, ja.
They all fell asleep that night.	Bohle ba ile ba robala bosiung boo.
It was one day of celebration.	E ne e le letsatsi le le leng la mokete.
Get up and go.	Tloha u tsamaee.
We have a few hours before dinner, and he said.	Re na le lihora tse 'maloa pele ho lijo tsa mantsiboea,' me a re.
I'm too late.	Ke morao haholo.
We paid and left.	Re ile ra lefa eaba rea ​​tsamaea.
So he went back to live with his mother.	Kahoo a khutlela ho ea lula le ’mè oa hae.
He will come out.	O tla tsoa.
I'm not sure why this is happening.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore na hobaneng sena se etsahala.
News comes out very quickly.	Litaba li tsoa kapele haholo.
You have to want to be better.	U tlameha ho batla ho ba betere.
We start with the news.	Re qala ka litaba.
Because, you don't know enough.	Hobane, ha o tsebe ho lekana.
I know what they will say.	Ke tseba seo ba tla se bua.
And I'm sorry.	Mme ke masoabi.
We have to do something.	Re tlameha ho etsa ho hong.
Now, that's not a problem.	Jwale, ha se bothata.
Or maybe it's not good.	Kapa mohlomong ha e ntle.
I'm scared.	Kea tšaba.
And that, you might want to think, is often how things work.	Mme hore, o ka rata ho nahana, hangata ke hore na lintho li sebetsa joang.
But it's so much fun.	Empa ho monate haholo.
Most people live in this area.	Batho ba bangata ba lula sebakeng sena.
This did not work at all.	Sena ha sea ka sa sebetsa ho hang.
And why not.	Mme hobaneng ho se joalo.
Never make a decision.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua etsa qeto.
Maybe that didn't matter.	Mohlomong hoo ho ne ho se taba.
Not sure if it is the best method but it works.	Ha ho na bonnete ba hore ke mokhoa o motle ka ho fetisisa empa oa sebetsa.
So much for that approach.	Haholo bakeng sa mokhoa oo.
He had not yet spoken, but he did not need to.	O ne a eso ho bue, empa o ne a sa hloke ho etsa jwalo.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka e etsa joang.
He agreed and let her get what she wanted.	O ile a lumela 'me a mo lumella hore a fumane seo a se batlang.
She doesn't just want a man.	Ha a batle monna feela.
You get a better place.	O fumana sebaka betere.
He wasn't in the back room, either.	O ne a se ka kamoreng e ka morao, le hona.
Do you.	Na u.
It would have been much worse.	E ka be e bile mpe haholo.
They have to do it.	Ba tlameha ho etsa joalo.
Mine was the first one.	Ea ka e bile ea pele.
However, I have heard of it.	Leha ho le joalo, ke utloile ka eona.
I haven't looked at it for years.	Ke lilemo tse ngata ke sa li sheba.
Let's be what we are.	A re be seo re leng sona.
He got home.	A fihla hae.
There would be no place.	Ho ka be ho se sebaka.
People could see it now.	Batho ba ne ba ka e bona joale.
I like being with my friends.	Ke rata ho ba le metsoalle ea ka.
I don't want to see him again.	Ha ke batle ho mo bona hape.
There is nothing to them.	Ha ho letho ho bona.
It was not very important.	E ne e se ea bohlokoa haholo.
My father will be glad to see us there.	Ntate o tla thabela ho re bona moo.
We love them very much.	Re ba rata haholo.
Production continues.	Tlhahiso e tsoela pele.
He suffered even more.	O ile a utloa bohloko le ho feta.
The reason for this is not hard to find.	Lebaka la sena ha le thata ho le fumana.
We were not making a lot of money.	Re ne re sa etse chelete e ngata.
It is better to do so.	Ho molemo hore u etse joalo.
We had such a wonderful time.	Re bile le nako e monate joalo.
They enjoyed playing with their children.	Ba ne ba thabela ho bapala le bana ba bona.
I got the money down.	Ke ile ka fumana chelete fatše.
However, this did not happen.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha sea ka sa etsahala.
Take it if you have children.	E nke haeba u na le bana.
She looked at him intently.	A mo sheba ka hloko.
There was no room for that.	Ho ne ho se na sebaka ka moo.
It was easier said than done, of course.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho bua ho feta ho etsa, ehlile.
But it didn't matter now.	Empa ho ne ho se taba jwale.
I don't think you need help either.	Ha ke nahane hore le uena ha u batle thuso.
Is this your car?	Na ena ke koloi ea hau?
And yet you may need some time to think about it.	'Me leha ho le joalo u ka' na ua hloka nako e itseng ea ho nahana ka eona.
No one knows.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang.
I had a problem with this for a few days.	Ke bile le bothata ka sena matsatsi a 'maloa.
Do you have something you want to talk about?	A na u na le seo u batlang ho bua ka sona?
However, it was not easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se bonolo.
Except at night.	Ntle le bosiu.
He had a difficult week.	O bile le beke e thata.
It was my first job.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa ka oa pele.
I just realized that he was no longer there.	Ke ile ka hlokomela feela hore ha a sa le eo.
Thanks again for reading.	Ke leboha hape ka ho bala.
It's just me.	Ke 'na feela.
Although difficult.	Leha ho le thata.
It was empty, it was empty.	E ne e se na letho, e se na letho.
Well, that did not happen.	Hantle, seo ha sea etsahala.
It was a good thing for them.	E ne e le ntho e ntle ho bona.
We'll be here another week.	Re tla ba mona beke e 'ngoe.
There seems to be one.	Ho bonahala eka ho na le.
For me, coffee can stand.	Ho 'na, kofi e ka ema.
That did just that.	Seo se ile sa etsa joalo.
And you.	Mme ke wena.
I don't like him very much.	Ha ke mo rate hakaalo.
There was still a problem.	Ho ne ho ntse ho e-na le bothata.
I need time to look into this.	Ke hloka nako ea ho sheba taba ena.
She put the baby to sleep.	O ile a robala ngoana.
In the evening, he always looks for her.	Mantsiboea, o lula a mo batla.
The same is true of others.	Ho joalo le ka ba bang.
We just have to catch it.	Re tlameha feela ho e tšoara.
It would be nice if others could see it too.	Ho ka ba monate ha ba bang le bona ba ka e bona.
I tried once more.	Ke ile ka leka hang hape.
I wanted to, you know that.	Ke ne ke batla, o tseba seo.
I really want to play.	Ka sebele ke batla ho bapala.
He is so good to one.	O molemo haholo ho e mong.
We have the grass and the grass, now we need time.	Re na le moo le joang, joale re hloka nako.
How are you?	U phela joang.
This should happen without speaking.	Sena se lokela ho etsahala ntle le ho bua.
See it here.	E bone mona.
It will be back soon !.	E tla khutla haufinyane!.
Be them.	E be bona.
I cried, thinking of them.	Ke ile ka lla, ke nahana ka bona.
No one can say for sure.	Ha ho motho ea ka buang hantle.
This allowed us to give more easily to the team.	Sena se ile sa re lumella ho fana ka bonolo haholoanyane ho sehlopha.
See you soon and have a great day!	Ke tla u bona haufinyane 'me u be le letsatsi le monate!
Someone did everything.	Ho na le motho ea entseng ntho eohle.
I hope you can be with us to live.	Ke tšepa hore u ka ba le rona ho phela.
And she wept.	Mme a lla.
I'm just happy to be here.	Ke thabela ho tla mona feela.
Yes, we needed you.	E, re ne re u hloka.
It is his last work.	Ke mosebetsi oa hae oa ho qetela.
He said he had a headache.	O ile a re o tšoeroe ke hlooho.
He had seen it before.	O ne a e bone pele a e bona.
Make sure you take water with you.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u nka metsi le uena.
I no longer have this problem.	Ha ke sa na bothata bona.
They are just some of us.	Ke ba bang feela ba rona.
I hear it from you.	Ke e utloa ho uena.
I would also like to comment here.	Le 'na ke kopa ho fana ka maikutlo mona.
Once a week is a lot.	Hang ka beke ke ntho e ngata.
But that will not happen.	Empa hoo ho ke ke ha etsahala.
My life was better because you were in it.	Bophelo ba ka bo ne bo le betere hobane le ne le le ho bona.
There was nothing surprising about it.	Ho ne ho se letho le makatsang ka eona.
I'm done deciding.	Ke qetile ho etsa qeto.
She never knew our mother.	Ha a eso tsebe mme wa rona.
Talk to any doctor.	Bua le ngaka leha e le efe.
To do so you need to go.	Ho etsa joalo o hloka ho tsamaea.
I wonder what will happen ?.	Kea ipotsa hore na ho tla etsahalang?.
If we have more, it can be fun.	Haeba re na le ho feta, ho ka ba monate.
Reason for presence.	Lebaka la ho ba teng.
Well, it's really legal indeed.	Hantle, ha e le hantle ka molao ehlile.
I asked her if she had children.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na o na le bana.
It was as if he had not slept.	E ne eka o ne a sa robala.
It was a wonderful time.	E ne e le nako e monate.
Like the best thing.	Joalo ka ntho e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
Just a good stand.	Ho ema hantle feela.
It's useless.	Ha e na thuso.
I knew more than to want problems.	Ke ne ke tseba ho feta ho batla mathata.
I know her better than anyone else.	Ke mo tseba ho feta mang kapa mang.
He needed them more than ever.	O ne a li hloka ho feta leha e le neng pele.
You have to think of something, or someone.	U lokela ho nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe, kapa motho e mong.
She feels good.	O ikutloa hantle.
But it is very simple.	Empa ho bonolo haholo.
It takes time to get that.	Ho nka nako ho fumana seo.
She had just met the man.	O ne a sa tsoa kopana le monna eo.
But this did not work.	Empa sena ha sea ka sa sebetsa.
When he looked again, he was still there.	Ha a sheba hape, o ne a ntse a le teng.
They are not.	Na ha ba eo.
For our family.	Bakeng sa lelapa la rona.
Mistake is bad, bad is bad.	Phoso e mpe, e mpe e mpe.
You are busy, you are busy, you are busy today.	O phathahane, o phathahane, o phathahane kajeno.
I want to know too.	Le nna ke batla ho tseba.
His parents knew nothing.	Batsoali ba hae ba ne ba sa tsebe letho.
Tonight there is no danger.	Bosiung bona ha ho kotsi.
But they refused.	Empa ba ile ba hana.
This is not always the case.	Ha se kamehla ho leng joalo.
He was really able to play.	O ne a hlile a khona ho bapala.
Of course it is.	Ehlile ho hlakile.
Where he was, the real thing was.	Moo a neng a le teng, ntho ya sebele e ne e le teng.
He decided that it was	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore ho joalo
He may even win.	A ka ba a hlola.
This is from me.	Sena se tsoa ho 'na.
You can't understand how that could work.	Ha u khone ho utloisisa hore na seo se ka sebetsa joang.
He would have to leave.	O ne a tla tlameha ho tsamaea.
Our job was to do all this work.	Mosebetsi oa rona e ne e le ho etsa mosebetsi ona kaofela.
You have to spend time.	U tlameha ho sebelisa nako.
That fact is accepted as a fundamental law of nature.	Taba eo ke 'nete.
No one else can do that job.	Ha ho motho e mong ya ka etsang mosebetsi oo.
I will never go back.	Ha ke sa tla khutlela morao.
Tomorrow, first thing.	Hosane, ntho ya pele.
Discover amazing things.	Fumana lintho tse makatsang tse makatsang.
But, this was not enough.	Empa, sena se ne se sa lekana.
There was something that he felt was very important.	Ho na le ntho eo a neng a e utloa e le ea bohlokoa.
People like children exist.	Batho ba kang bana ba teng.
I think they work here.	Ke nahana hore ba sebetsa mona.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
We hope you feel the same way.	Re tšepa hore le uena u ikutloa joalo.
I was alive.	Ke ne ke le bophelo.
I think the worst.	Ke nahana tse mpe ka ho fetisisa.
You hear things.	U utloa lintho.
However, sometimes.	Leha ho le joalo, ka linako tse ling.
We picked it up, played it again.	Re ile ra nka, ra e bapala hape.
All the rest goes well without it.	Tse ling kaofela li tsamaea hantle ntle le eona.
Do not look at them, please.	U se ke ua li sheba ka kopo.
I was very happy, to be honest.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo, ho bua 'nete.
I was very happy.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo.
They are just learning where everything is.	Ba ntse ba ithuta feela moo ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe e leng teng.
He said he wanted to come back.	O itse o batla ho khutla.
Now this species is in danger.	Hona joale mofuta ona o kotsing.
It takes time !.	Ho nka nako!.
That's the job.	Ke mosebetsi oo.
He never has anything bad to say about anyone.	Ha ho mohla a bang le ntho e mpe eo a ka e buang ka mang kapa mang.
I will take care of everything.	Ke tla hlokomela tsohle.
I have a lot of them.	Ke na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
A man with a son, his only child.	Monna ea nang le mora, ngoana oa hae a le mong.
Then it's a good time to get it.	Ebe nako e monate ea ho e fumana.
It is, and it is not.	Ho joalo, 'me ha ho joalo.
The request comes too late.	Kopo e tla morao haholo.
It will come, he thought, it will come.	E tla tla, a nahana, e tla tla.
It could be easier.	Ho ka ba bonolo haholoanyane.
There was nothing he could do here.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang mona.
It still is.	Ho ntse ho le joalo.
No one has the same feelings as man.	Ha ho motho ea nang le maikutlo a tšoanang le a motho.
It can be anywhere.	E ka ba kae kapa kae.
Do another.	Etsang e mong.
He doesn't have to say that.	Ha A lokela ho bolela seo.
That's why.	Ke ka lebaka leo.
It would not be the first time.	E ka be e se lekhetlo la pele.
He had no one else.	O ne a se na motho e mong.
We spent all our time reading.	Re ile ra qeta nako eohle re bala.
That's nice to say.	Ke ntho e monate ho e bua.
I don't care what they think of me.	Ha ke tsotelle seo ba se nahanang ka 'na.
Have a great week !.	Eba le beke e monate!.
After that, it worked well.	Ka mor'a moo, e ile ea sebetsa hantle.
Everyone takes their ideas from you.	E mong le e mong o nka maikutlo a hae ho uena.
Of course, that is not the case.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho joalo.
He decided to leave.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho tsamaea.
How often do you visit a restaurant?	U etela ntlo ea lijo hangata hakae?
And he came.	Mme a tla.
He had never said that before.	O ne a eso bue jwalo pele.
It is nothing to me to go find him.	Ha se letho ho 'na ho ea mo fumana.
They paid a lot of money for the house.	Ba ile ba lefa chelete e ngata bakeng sa ntlo.
It would be his job.	E ne e tla ba mosebetsi oa hae.
Eventually it became too much.	Qetellong e ile ea e-ba ngata haholo.
Nothing, really.	Ha ho letho, ka 'nete.
It really takes a day.	Ka sebele e nka letsatsi.
I had never seen anything like it.	Ke ne ke qala ho bona lintho tse joalo.
Take a lot.	Nka e ngata.
I opened it.	Ke ile ka e bula.
So no one went.	Kahoo ha ho motho ea ileng a tsamaea.
As you do.	Joalo ka ha u etsa.
They wanted something more.	Ba ne ba batla ho hong ho feta.
They knew the reason.	Ba ne ba tseba lebaka.
I cried	Ke ile ka lla
I decided to give it a go.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho fana ka eona.
I like being a girl.	Ke rata ho ba ngoanana.
Please have a good life.	Ke kopa o be le bophelo bo monate.
People look like humans.	Batho ba shebahala joaloka batho.
He did not know what had happened.	O ne a sa tsebe se etsahetseng.
They would return.	Ba ne ba tla khutla.
I tried again and found the same error.	Ke ile ka leka hape mme ka fumana phoso e tšoanang.
What you have but do not have.	Seo u nang le sona empa u se na sona.
It seems easy but it is not.	Ho bonahala ho le bonolo empa ha ho joalo.
One day, he came to me.	Ka letsatsi le leng, o ile a tla ho 'na.
Please start locally.	Ka kopo, qala sebakeng.
Lots of people now.	Batho ba bangata hona joale.
It gives you the space you need.	E u fa sebaka seo u se hlokang.
He did not like to drive.	O ne a sa rate ho khanna.
I know their children, some of them.	Ke tseba bana ba bona, ba bang ba bona.
We became good friends.	Re ile ra ba metsoalle e molemo.
It was my first time trying that.	E ne e le lekhetlo la ka la pele ho leka joalo.
Some considered him to be a doctor.	Ba bang ba ne ba mo nka e le ngaka.
It would be nice to know who owns the money.	Ho ka ba monate ho tseba hore na chelete ea mang.
It was very close.	E ne e le haufi haholo.
They were tired from the long walk.	Ba ne ba khathetse ke ho tsamaea nako e telele.
But the police were there.	Empa mapolesa a ne a le teng.
He will be coming soon.	O tla fihla haufinyane.
My parents are very healthy.	Batsoali ba ka ba phela hantle haholo.
In their time.	Ka nako ea bona.
That is what he really wanted.	Ke sona seo a neng a se batla haholo.
Don't even ask!	U se ke ua ba ua botsa!
Find a man.	Fumana monna.
I was the first to go to it.	Ke ne ke qala ho ea ho eona.
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le joalo.
That is why it is so difficult for us.	Ke ka hona ho leng boima ho rona.
I have friends who have money.	Ke na le metsoalle e nang le chelete.
That's how it felt.	Ke kamoo e neng e ikutloa kateng.
He has been good to me.	O bile molemo ho nna.
I was walking faster than before.	Ke ne ke tsamaea ho feta pele.
He fixed them in place.	A li lokisa sebakeng.
Of course, none of us did.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea ileng a etsa joalo.
She has beautiful clothes.	O na le liaparo tse ntle.
Everyone was eating.	Batho bohle ba ne ba ja.
So we do not sit down in the morning.	Kahoo ha re lule fatše hoseng.
It makes no,.	E etsa hore che,.
Who got it.	Eo a ileng a e fumana.
Note that this occurs only once.	Hlokomela hore sena se etsahala hang feela.
We are not talking about anything and everything.	Ha re bue ka letho le ka tsohle.
You did not have to go to school.	O ne o sa tlameha ho kena sekolo.
It is difficult to see how much money they will make.	Ho thata ho bona hore na ba tla etsa chelete e ngata joang.
I am with your child.	Ke na le ngoana oa hau.
I can do it if you want.	Nka e etsa ha o batla.
I heard.	Ke utloile.
So, I don't like it at all.	Kahoo, ha ke rate ho hang.
However, this method is not problematic.	Leha ho le joalo, mokhoa ona ha o na mathata.
We were all here.	Kaofela re ne re le mona.
Obviously she hadn’t said much about me to him.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a e-s’o bue hakaalo ka ’na ho eena.
We have enough financial trouble as it stands.	Re na le bothata ba chelete bo lekaneng kamoo bo leng kateng.
I would just do something fun.	Nka mpa ka etsa ntho e monate.
Then why not do that.	Joale ke hobane'ng ha u sa etse joalo.
Make sure you keep the current time close.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u boloka nako ea hona joale e le haufi.
Then its work.	Joale mosebetsi oa eona.
I was able to get out.	Ke ne ke khona ho tsoa.
He wanted to join them.	O ne a batla ho kena le bona.
This was not real time.	Sena e ne e se ka nako ea sebele.
Maybe me too.	Mohlomong le 'na.
Go ahead, try it.	Tsoela pele, leka.
Very people, that.	Batho haholo, seo.
I'm glad to know its name.	Ke thabela ho tseba lebitso la eona.
I don't know what to tell you.	Ha ke tsebe hore na nka o bolella eng.
In his opinion.	Ka maikutlo a hae.
He wanted to make amends.	O ne a batla ho lokisa litaba.
And they keep going.	'Me ba ntse ba tsoela pele.
One important point.	Taba e le 'ngoe ea bohlokoa.
And that will not happen.	Mme seo se ke ke sa etsahala.
It was here, he felt, where the real problem lies.	E ne e le mona, a ikutloa, moo bothata ba sebele bo leng teng.
Nobody knows where you are.	Haho motho ya tsebang moo o leng teng.
See if you can find out if he still exists.	Bona hore na u ka tseba hore na o ntse a le teng.
It is useless to have life if it is useless.	Ha ho na thuso ho ba le bophelo haeba bo se na thuso.
He does not want to go without it.	Ha a batle ho tsamaea ntle le eona.
But they would see.	Empa ba ne ba tla bona.
I have new hobbies.	Ke na le lintho tseo ke li ratang tse ncha.
I have a house.	Ke na le ntlo.
But more than that we do not need to go.	Empa ho feta mona ha ho hlokahale hore re tsamaee.
I knew it was coming.	Ke ne ke tseba hore e tla tla.
That doesn't seem likely.	Seo ha se bonahale se ka etsahala.
I was there.	Ke ne ke le teng.
No, it's yours.	Che, ke ea hau.
That would be fun.	Hoo ho ka ba monate.
They can do whatever they want.	Ba ka etsa eng kapa eng eo ba e batlang.
This has always been her problem.	Sena esale e le bothata ba hae.
It was almost impossible to find them.	Ho ne ho batla ho le thata ho li fumana.
So it was fun.	Kahoo ho ne ho le monate.
Get enough sleep.	Robala ka ho lekaneng.
I could hear crying in the backyard.	Ke ne ke utloa ho lla ka mor'a ntlo.
That's good news.	Ke litaba tse monate.
I can't read.	Ha ke khone ho bala.
Or in the past.	Kapa nakong e fetileng.
We've been driving it since this morning.	Haesale re e khanna ho tloha hoseng hona.
A young man and woman are crying.	Mohlankana le mosali ba lla ka bobeli.
Yes, but that was yesterday.	E, empa hoo e ne e le maobane.
That, of course, is not the case.	Ho hlakile hore hoo hase ’nete.
Sorry if my question is weird.	Ke masoabi haeba potso ea ka e le e makatsang.
So that's not a problem.	Kahoo ha se bothata.
I also did not eat anything.	Le ’na ha kea ka ka ja letho.
What are they doing?	Ba etsa eng?
And I don't know if I'm doing it right.	Hape ha ke tsebe haeba ke e etsa hantle.
I do not like it.	Ha ke e rate.
It would take too long.	Ho ne ho tla nka nako e telele haholo.
Or better yet, go with you.	Kapa ho molemo le ho feta, e tsamaee le uena.
They can tell you.	Ba ka o bolella.
This, too, will pass.	Sena, le sona, se tla feta.
They loved him.	Ba ne ba mo rata.
It was delicious to eat.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ja.
He helped us get to where we are.	O ile a re thusa ho fihla moo re leng teng.
Your job is to make them think about it.	Mosebetsi oa hau ke ho etsa hore ba nahane ka eona.
Look carefully.	Sheba ka hloko.
Sometimes you have to work on it.	Ka linako tse ling u tlameha ho sebetsa ho eona.
Then the ride passed.	Ebe ho palama ho feta.
It is necessary.	Hoa hlokahala.
Maybe it’s a matter of how you’re progressing.	Mohlomong ke taba ea hore na u ntse u tsoela pele joang.
I hope you had fun !!.	Kea tšepa u bile monate!!.
His, it didn't matter.	Tsa hae, ho ne ho se taba.
He has priorities.	O na le lintho tse tlang pele.
I wish we had time.	Ke lakatsa eka re ka ba le nako.
I hope so too.	Le 'na kea tšepa hore ha ho joalo.
But if you have to go, you have to.	Empa haeba u tlameha ho tsamaea, u tlameha.
You can take a car.	O ka nka koloi.
Do not go.	U se ke ua tsamaea.
So a little was needed for this, it seemed to him.	Kahoo ho ne ho hlokahala hanyane bakeng sa sena, ho ne ho bonahala ho eena.
It was almost a few years ago.	E ne e batla e etsa lilemo tse 'maloa tse fetileng.
Maybe that will happen this year.	Mohlomong seo se tla etsahala selemong sena.
He decided.	O ile a etsa qeto.
In fact, they were trying to help him.	Ha e le hantle, ba ne ba leka ho mo thusa.
We like to start the day early.	Re rata ho qala letsatsi esale hoseng.
But, we did.	Empa, re ile ra etsa joalo.
Look at the place.	Sheba sebaka.
I think they know what's going on.	Ke nahana hore ba tseba se etsahalang.
However, this is not a good idea.	Leha ho le joalo, ona ha se mohopolo o motle.
Some do it faster than others.	Ba bang ba e etsa kapele ho feta ba bang.
No need to buy.	Ha ho hlokahale ho reka.
It's just my opinion.	Ke maikutlo a ka feela.
Let me think.	E re ke nahane.
But that did not happen.	Empa seo ha se sa ka.
But once you start that thing, you have to keep it.	Empa ha o qala ntho eo, o tlameha ho e boloka.
It cannot have both.	Ha e khone ho ba le eona ka bobeli.
He loved it.	O ile a e rata.
People could have used it.	Ho ne ho ka etsahala hore ebe batho ba ne ba e sebelisa.
I know my team did.	Kea tseba hore sehlopha sa ka se entse joalo.
I needed him to know that.	Ke ne ke hloka hore a tsebe seo.
I am close to his family.	Ke haufi le lelapa la hae.
I am tired of the cries of my children.	Ke khathetse ke ho lla ha bana ba ka.
Which route do you plan to take?	U rera ho nka tsela efe?
That's the last thing you need.	Ke ntho ya ho qetela eo o e hlokang.
From there.	Ho tloha moo.
I'm sorry about that, but there is a reason.	Ke masoabi ka seo, empa ho na le lebaka.
He didn't see it.	Ha a ka a e bona.
I need to call soon.	Ke hloka ho letsa kapele.
I just wonder why.	Ke ipotsa feela lebaka la seo.
I want to talk about them.	Ke batla ho bua ka tsona.
Do not do this to me.	O seke oa etsa sena ka nna.
Of many things.	Ea lintho tse ngata.
Who will win this year?	Ke mang ea tla hlola selemong see?
There was one after you left alone.	Ho ne ho e-na le e 'ngoe ka mor'a hore u tsamaee u le mong.
He never asked how he was doing.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a botsa hore na o phela joang.
It can be anything.	E ka ba eng kapa eng.
I too try to do my own thing.	Le 'na ke leka ho etsa ntho ea ka.
That was always a problem for him.	Seo e ne e lula e le bothata ho eena.
You don't care here.	Ha u na taba mona.
I wish it was me.	Ke lakatsa eka e ka be e le nna.
I had to quit my job.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tlohela mosebetsi oa ka.
In fact, look.	Ka 'nete, sheba.
Anything anyone else has done with you can do it.	Ntho leha e le efe eo motho leha e le ofe a e entseng le uena u ka e etsa.
It was just this morning.	E ne e le hoseng hona feela.
I had a hearing problem.	Ke ne ke na le bothata ba ho utloa.
Yes, he did.	E, o ile a etsa joalo.
And he was very playful.	Mme o ne a bapala haholo.
They like to play.	Ba rata ho bapala.
And they will not know.	Mme ba ke ke ba tseba.
You can do what you like.	U ka etsa seo u se ratang.
Thinking about things.	Ho nahana ka lintho.
But nothing else.	Empa ha ho letho le leng.
Next week they can find another girl.	Bekeng e tlang ba ka fumana ngoanana e mong.
Absolutely no one.	Ho hang ha ho motho.
To the child they did not plan.	Ho ngoana ba ne ba sa rera.
He decided to go for a long walk.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho tsamaea nako e telele.
I loved my old car.	Ke ne ke rata koloi ea ka ea khale.
I say things.	Ke bua lintho.
The children refused.	Bana ba ile ba hana.
I believed she had been crying.	Ke ne ke lumela hore esale a lla.
Then ask me to stay.	Ebe u kopa hore ke lule.
However, it is still happening.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ntse ho etsahala.
He would pay for it.	O ne a tla e lefa.
Either way, the man needs to go.	Ka tsela e 'ngoe, monna o hloka ho tsamaea.
I will work on them tomorrow.	Ke tla li sebetsa hosane.
Know my pain.	Tseba bohloko ba ka.
Now, before it is too late.	Jwale, pele e eba morao haholo.
I want to play, but no one else	Ke batla ho bapala, empa ha ho na motho e mong
But there are many more.	Empa ho na le tse ling tse ngata.
I don't need to know that.	Haho hlokahale hore ke tsebe seo.
It makes things easier.	E etsa hore lintho li be bonolo.
He didn't have to.	O ne a sa tlameha.
But you have to work.	Empa u tlameha ho sebetsa.
I don't care who it was or who made it.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na e ne e le mang kapa ke mang ya e entseng.
Of course, it worked.	Ehlile, e ile ea sebetsa.
It's nice to be there.	Ho monate ho ba teng.
The young man saw his opportunity and took advantage of it.	Mohlankana o ile a bona monyetla oa hae eaba oa o sebelisa.
You are sure to win.	O na le bonnete ba hore o tla hlola.
So good !.	E ntle joalo!.
Whatever they could, they took it.	Eng kapa eng eo ba neng ba ka e khona, ba ne ba e nka.
He said nothing.	Ha a ka a bua letho.
Don't drink too much!	U se ke ua noa haholo!
She knew he looked good.	O ne a tseba hore o shebahala hantle.
I didn't have to do it.	Ha kea tlameha ho etsa.
He said he was tired of making money.	O itse o khathetse ke ho etsa chelete.
I had never heard anything like it.	Ke ne ke qala ho utloa ntho e kang eona.
That's what they're good at.	Ke seo ba leng molemo ho sona.
That place is just right.	Sebaka seo hantle feela.
I'm glad I went to this place.	Ke thabetse hore ebe ke ile sebakeng sena.
The situation was dire.	Boemo e ne e le bo boima.
No one really wanted to ask.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a hlile a batla ho botsa.
Instead it was the other way around.	Ho e-na le hoo e ne e le ka tsela e ’ngoe.
The rest of us did not.	Le rōna ba bang ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
It should be a good thing to have a lifelong career.	E lokela ho ba ntho e ntle ho ba le mosebetsi oa bophelo bohle.
We are here.	Re mona.
Yet there was nothing there.	Leha ho le joalo ho ne ho se letho moo.
They just want you to do well.	Ba mpa ba batla hore o etse hantle.
We never spoke again.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bua hape.
This group looks fun.	Sehlopha sena se bonahala se le monate.
It was this morning when we finally found them.	E ne e le hoseng hona ha qetellong re li fumana.
See, it was you.	Le a bona, e ne e le wena.
We can go.	Re ka tsamaea.
Forget about money.	Lebala ka chelete.
As of now it has to wait until the end of the week.	Joalo ka ha e le hona joale e tlameha ho ema ho fihlela qetellong ea beke.
This was true.	Sena e ne e le 'nete.
I have to go now.	Ke lokela ho tsamaea hona joale.
There were many similarities.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo ba tšoanang ka tsona.
That's what you said.	Ke seo u se buileng.
We didn't play them, but we saw them play.	Ha rea ​​ka ra li bapala, empa re li bone ha li bapala.
I didn’t care enough.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle ho lekana.
I did.	Ke entse.
I would write.	Ke ne ke tla ngola.
It is important.	Ke ea bohlokoa.
We were still there.	Re ne re ntse re le teng.
You didn't care what happened to the rest of us.	O ne o sa tsotelle hore na ho etsahetseng ka rona ba bang.
No one spoke much.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a bua haholo.
We too know many things that will happen.	Le rona re tseba lintho tse ngata tse tla etsahala.
He really felt it was true.	O ne a hlile a ikutloa hore ke ’nete.
I know that others love them.	Kea tseba hore ba bang baa ba rata.
I like it very much because it is simple.	Ke e rata haholo hobane e bonolo.
I could not get out of there quickly enough.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho tsoa moo kapele ho lekana.
There is danger tonight.	Ho na le kotsi bosiung bona.
And you want to know why.	'Me u batla ho tseba lebaka.
You do not see.	Ha o bone.
I really wanted to.	Ke ne ke hlile ke batla.
They have to do everything for him.	Ba tlameha ho mo etsetsa ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
I go to make sure they get water and food.	Ke tsamaea ho etsa bonnete ba hore ba fumana metsi le lijo.
That's a bad thing.	Ke ntho e mpe.
Obviously they were happy.	Ho hlakile hore ba ne ba thabile.
But the house was empty.	Empa ntlo e ne e se na motho.
To me, that means a lot.	Ho 'na, seo se bua haholo.
He had never thought of that.	O ne a eso nahane ka seo.
I think you will really enjoy it.	Ke nahana hore o tla e thabela haholo.
He did it by hand.	O ile a etsa ka matsoho.
It's just that we don't do that.	Ke feela hore ha re etse joalo.
We all do that.	Kaofela ha rōna re etsa joalo.
Whatever you want.	Eng kapa eng eo u e batlang.
I look better.	Ke shebahala betere.
However, I knew this was not going to be an opportunity.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke tseba hore sena e ne e ke ke ea e-ba monyetla.
Your feedback is important to us.	Maikutlo a hau a bohlokoa ho rona.
He had not done so for years.	O ne a se a qetile lilemo a sa etse joalo.
But it was too late for that.	Empa e ne e se e le morao haholo bakeng sa seo.
It's just that they are useless.	Ke feela hore ha ba na thuso.
She is OK.	O ntse a phela hantle.
But it is useless.	Empa ha ho na thuso.
However, they did not know what to do.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba batla ba sa tsebe hore na ba etse eng.
Look at my mother.	Sheba mme wa ka.
One just had to get it.	Motho o ne a tlameha ho e fumana feela.
Only he could understand what it meant.	Ke eena feela ea neng a ka utloisisa hore na e ka bolela eng.
Which is very new to me.	E leng ntho e ncha haholo ho 'na.
All sorts of things.	Lintho tsa mofuta ona kaofela.
Has it ever happened.	Na ho kile ha etsahala.
I still have a picture of that.	Ke ntse ke na le setšoantšo sa seo.
It was if.	E ne e le haeba.
And that's exactly the point.	'Me ke eona taba hantle.
That gave him a chance.	Seo se ile sa mo fa monyetla o itseng.
People are very happy about it.	Batho ba thabile haholo ka eona.
I was very tired.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo.
He knew he was there without looking.	O ne a tseba hore o teng ntle le ho sheba.
He was almost gone now.	O ne a se a batla a le sieo hona joale.
No, that is not true.	Che, seo hase ’nete.
Something wonderful happened.	Ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang.
Or another group somewhere.	Kapa sehlopha se seng sebakeng se seng.
Everyone here does that.	E mong le e mong mona o etsa joalo.
As it could be.	Joalo ka ha ho ka ba joalo.
She often asks him for his breakfast.	Hangata o mo kopa lijo tsa hae tsa hoseng.
There was only one chance.	Ho ne ho e-na le monyetla o mong feela.
We never thought of this.	Re ne re sa nahana ka sena.
Make my mind light '.	Etsa hore kelello ea ka e be bonolo'.
People believe what they want to believe.	Batho ba lumela seo ba batlang ho se lumela.
First impressions are always important.	Maikutlo a pele a bohlokoa kamehla.
That was nothing.	Eo e neng e se letho.
There is no way to survive if things continue to get that far.	Ha ho na mokhoa oa ho phela haeba lintho li tsoela pele ho fihlela moo.
I have to get out.	Ke tlameha ho tsoa.
Be careful!	Hlokomela!
I was very happy.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo.
Thank you so much for being able to see.	Ke leboha haholo hore ebe motho o khona ho bona.
We love it so much.	Re e rata haholo.
Her son needs help.	Mora oa hae o hloka thuso.
But this passed.	Empa sena se ile sa feta.
Both of these things require many human hours.	Lintho tseo ka bobeli li hlokang lihora tse ngata tsa motho.
What ever.	Eng kapa eng.
None of them have money.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea nang le chelete.
This is all true.	Sena ke 'nete eohle.
He will come and play with me.	O tla tla ho bapala le nna.
He was still with her.	O ne a ntse a e-na le eena.
You go home.	U ea hae.
It was a party.	E ne e le mokete.
That's mine.	Ke tsa ka tseo.
Now here we are.	Joale re mona.
Why did they want to talk to him? 	Ke hobane’ng ha ba ne ba batla ho bua le eena?
He does things.	O etsa lintho.
I plan to.	Ke rera ho.
Or say nothing.	Kapa u se ke ua bua letho.
Hard working.	O sebetsa ka thata.
But it was fun.	Empa ho ne ho le monate.
What about you?	Wena eng?.
The task is not difficult.	Mosebetsi ha o thata.
How things went.	Kamoo lintho li ileng tsa tsamaea kateng.
The man knew nothing.	Monna eo o ne a sa tsebe letho.
You see, my husband is not here.	Ua bona, monna oa ka ha a eo.
I don't like that idea.	Ha ke rate mohopolo oo.
It will not be difficult.	Ho ke ke ha ba thata.
People ask this because they do not know what else they understand.	Batho ba botsa sena hobane ha ba tsebe hore na ba utloisise eng hape.
Of course not.	Ha e le hantle ha ho joalo.
I mean you're talking to me.	Ke bolela hore o ntse o bua le nna.
I knew nothing about this.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe letho ka sena.
They always did good.	Kamehla ba ne ba etsa tse ntle.
You have to get out of here.	O lokela ho tsoa ho feta.
It really opened up my life.	Ka sebele e ile ea bula bophelo ba ka.
Maybe I shouldn’t.	Mohlomong ha kea lokela.
We'll talk in the morning.	Re tla bua hoseng.
But times were hard.	Empa linako li ne li le boima.
Also, he did it so that he could get out of work quickly.	Hape, o ile a e etsa e le hore a ka tsoa mosebetsing kapele.
Often, you see.	Hangata, o a bona.
I needed both.	Ke ne ke li hloka ka bobeli.
I know there is value in it.	Kea tseba hore ho na le bohlokoa ho eona.
It was even harder.	Ho ne ho le boima le ho feta.
The more you learn to drive, the harder it will be to make money.	Ha u ntse u ithuta ho khanna, chelete e tla ba thata.
You probably would not understand.	Mohlomong u ne u ke ke ua utloisisa.
I really needed to find life.	Ke ne ke hlile ke hloka ho fumana bophelo.
I have no money right now.	Ha ke na chelete hona joale.
Maybe I eat too much.	Mohlomong ke ja haholo.
Any accident.	Kotsi efe kapa efe.
I had time to think.	Ke ile ka ba le nako ea ho nahana.
Unless they do.	Ntle le ha ba etsa joalo.
Our hands want to do it.	Matsoho a rona a batla ho e etsa.
That’s how you want to play.	Ke kamoo u batlang ho bapala kateng.
I'm sorry, you said.	Ke masoabi, u re.
I want to ask you a question.	Ke batla ho o botsa potso.
Not so.	Haho joalo.
He is right.	O bolela hantle.
That’s more than easy.	Hoo ho feta ho ba bonolo.
The years passed.	Lilemo li ile tsa feta.
He only had one job now.	O ne a e-na le mosebetsi o le mong feela joale.
Who did that to him.	Ke mang ea neng a mo entse joalo.
That's great.	Ke hantle haholo.
Anything you can talk about with him.	Eng kapa eng eo u ka buang ka eona le eena.
Because they love you.	Ke hobane ba o rata.
Family matters.	Tsa lelapa.
I didn't have one.	Ke ne ke se na 'na.
There is no easy task.	Ha ho mosebetsi o bonolo.
No other thought is needed.	Ha ho hlokahale mohopolo o mong.
The second is more difficult.	Ea bobeli e thata haholoanyane.
It's not really that bad.	Ha e hlile ha e mpe.
We'll see what happens.	Re tla bona se etsahalang.
I waited.	Ke ile ka lebella.
This issue has an important issue.	Taba ena e na le boemo ba bohlokoa.
You will need that help.	O tla hloka thuso eo.
It was too long.	E ne e le telele haholo.
They look so good, it's a shame to eat them.	Li shebahala li le ntle haholo, ke lihlong ho li ja.
I would stay there again.	Ke ne ke tla lula moo hape.
She was looking forward to seeing someone she knew here.	O ne a lebeletse ho bona motho eo a mo tsebang mona.
Everyone should help us.	E mong le e mong o lokela ho re thusa.
I felt better.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke le betere.
I went back to myself and continued to work.	Ke ile ka khutlela ho 'na 'me ka tsoela pele ho sebetsa.
I try to stand up.	Ke leka ho ema.
I could be a better person.	Nka ba motho ea betere.
I don't know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke efe.
I'm happy for you.	Ke thabetse uena.
Help should be secondary.	Thuso e lokela ho ba ea bobeli.
I get the idea.	Ke fumana mohopolo.
We are trying to fix this.	Re leka ho lokisa sena.
Take them if you have to.	Li nke haeba u tlameha.
It's a very real thing.	Ke ntho ea sebele haholo.
He was healthy.	O ne a phela hantle.
Using water is the last resort to use.	Ho sebelisa metsi ke mokhoa oa ho qetela oa ho sebelisa hape.
So be careful what you do.	Kahoo hlokomela seo u se etsang.
Now they can't.	Hona joale ha ba khone.
And you know it.	Mme le wena o a e tseba.
He could hear.	O ne a khona ho utloa.
That is not the case.	Ha se taba eo.
It doesn't matter to me.	Ha se letho ho nna.
I'll take the second one first.	Ke tla nka ea bobeli pele.
But the Father, his mind, his mind.	Empa Ntate, kelello ea hae, kelello ea hae .
Expect to travel a lot.	Lebella ho tsamaea haholo.
He told her he could not stay.	O ile a mo bolella hore a ke ke a lula.
Don't forget.	U se ke ua lebala .
You did not ask to be here.	Ha o a kopa ho ba mona.
I'm too late.	Ke morao haholo.
It is his celebration from now on.	Ke mokete wa hae ho tloha jwale.
Tell them.	U ba bolelle.
I know this is a bad time.	Kea tseba hore ena ke nako e mpe.
I see it today.	Ke e bona le kajeno.
It can be hard to say.	Ho ka ba thata ho bua.
That we should just go home.	Hore re mpe re ee hae.
That's all we do.	Ke seo re se etsang feela.
And that's a doctor.	Mme eo ke ngaka.
Whatever they do, it works.	Eng kapa eng eo ba e etsang, e ea sebetsa.
You work your way up to them.	U sebetsa ka tsela ea hau ho fihlela ho bona.
No one has a problem with this, except me.	Ha ho motho ea nang le bothata ka sena, ntle le 'na.
You can't stay.	U ke ke ua lula.
It is a foolish thing to do.	Ke ntho e hlokang kelello ho e etsa.
More on that in the future.	Tse ling ka seo nakong e tlang.
You can't do that.	U ke ke ua etsa ntho e joalo.
Just right.	Hantle feela.
Many came with friends.	Ba bangata ba ile ba tla le metsoalle.
He never said anything about the letter at all.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua letho ka lengolo ho hang.
It was the first time she had thought about it.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele a nahana ka eona.
They may not want to.	E ka ’na eaba ha ba batle.
No one knows where he is.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang moo a leng teng.
We live with it always.	Re phela le eona kamehla.
But some seemed to pass faster than others.	Empa ba bang ba ne ba bonahala ba feta kapele ho feta ba bang.
However, that was not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se joalo.
He took it home.	O ile a ea le eona hae.
These were his things.	Tsena e ne e le lintho tsa hae.
But there is an easier way, too.	Empa ho na le tsela e bonolo, hape.
I am reading and learning from them.	Ke ntse ke bala le ho ithuta ho bona.
Well, room.	Hantle, kamore.
He wanted her to leave.	O ne a batla hore a tsamaee.
So he did what he had to do.	Kahoo o ile a etsa seo a neng a lokela ho se etsa.
He was glad he had it.	O ne a thabetse hore ebe o na le eona.
Second, it is not for everyone.	Ea bobeli, ha se ea motho e mong le e mong.
You can write it any way.	U ka e ngola ka tsela efe kapa efe.
Keep track of your content.	Boloka mofuta oa litaba tsa hau.
Even now it is useless.	Le hona joale ha e na thuso.
I can't look at her right now.	Ha ke khone ho mo sheba hona joale.
He had never thought of that.	O ne a eso nahane ka seo.
Do not think of the idea.	U se ke ua nahana ka mohopolo.
He says.	O re.
I will not.	Nke ke.
She was beautiful.	O ne a le motle.
Of course you know.	Ehlile ua tseba.
I just can't get what he has.	Ke mpa ke sa fihlela seo a nang le sona.
Here is the problem with that.	Mona ke bothata ka seo.
This is surprisingly difficult.	Sena se thata ka tsela e makatsang.
We do.	Re etsa.
I almost felt sorry for it.	Ke ile ka batla ke utloa bohloko ka eona.
He would win.	O ne a tla hlola.
But he was not there.	Empa o ne a le sieo.
We are just children.	Re bana feela.
It seems too good to be true.	Ho bonahala ho le monate haholo hore e ka ba 'nete.
You have to try to get out more.	U tlameha ho leka ho tsoa ho feta.
He may have been there a week.	E ka ’na eaba o qetile beke a le moo.
It is very late now.	E se e le bosiu haholo.
We will work on it for a week.	Re tla e sebetsa ho ea bekeng.
They stand up and are simple.	Li ema 'me li bonolo.
Sometimes we did.	Ka nako e 'ngoe re ne re etsa joalo.
Look at the picture.	Sheba setšoantšo.
I have something in common with you.	Ke na le ntho e tšoanang le uena.
To know more read on.	Ho tseba haholoanyane bala ho.
I usually use a simpler method.	Hangata ke sebelisa mokhoa o bonolo haholoanyane.
He wondered how much of that came out of guilt.	O ne a ipotsa hore na hoo ho tsoa ho ba molato hakae.
It was when the police arrived.	E ne e ile ha mapolesa a fihla.
He goes there.	O ea moo.
It was the first time I had seen them.	Ke ne ke qala ho ba bona ba le joalo.
Sometimes things don't work out.	Ka linako tse ling lintho ha li tsamaee.
I knew it then.	Ke ne ke e tseba ka nako eo.
He knew very little about his life there.	O ne a tseba hanyane ka bophelo ba hae moo.
That's very nice.	Seo se setle haholo.
And it would not be easy.	'Me ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
Why don't you stay.	Ke hobane'ng ha u sa lule.
It is powerful.	E matla.
He was there.	O ne a le teng.
Nice to meet you.	Ke ne ke thabela ho kopana le uena.
This has been fun.	Sena se bile monate.
I saw that they were making a lot of money.	Ke ile ka bona hore ba etsa chelete e ngata.
I had to appear.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho bonahala.
The same thing applies here.	Taba e tšoanang e sebetsa mona.
It should not be a problem for you.	Ha ea lokela ho ba bothata ho uena.
We decide.	Re etsa qeto.
I can say that.	Nka bua hakaalo.
He thought he was saying something about it.	O ne a nahana hore o bolela ho hong ka hona.
My father did not tell me that.	Ntate ha a ka a mpolella seo.
I have seen the same things.	Ke bone lintho tse tšoanang.
These are powerful things.	Tsena ke lintho tse matla.
I can do something else like that.	Nka etsa e 'ngoe hape e joalo.
He did not get enough sleep.	O ne a sa robala ka ho lekaneng.
You see? 	Oa bona?
It would not take long.	E ne e ke ke ea nka nako e telele.
I think of my mother.	Ke nahana ka 'Mè.
That's a lot.	Ke haholo.
You don't hear anything anymore.	Ha u sa utloa letho.
It was already fun.	E ne e se e le monate.
I think we should play it.	Ke nahana hore re lokela ho e bapala.
Does this contain water?	Na see se na le metsi?
These issues do not matter.	Litaba tsena ha li na taba.
Also, his father is a very important person.	Hape, ntate oa hae ke motho oa bohlokoa haholo.
And his last.	Le ea hae ea ho qetela.
Well, you understand it.	Be, u e utloisisa.
Yes, good girl.	E, ngoanana ea molemo.
You look nice.	O shebahala hantle.
He did not stay long.	Ha a ka a ema nako e telele.
Instead of hiking, you may be driving.	Ho e-na le ho tsamaea ka maoto sebakeng se itseng, ho ka etsahala hore ebe u khanna ho ea moo.
It should not be too hard.	Ha ea lokela ho ba thata haholo.
I seemed to know him.	Ke ne ke bonahala ke mo tseba.
I can't say enough good things about it.	Ha ke khone ho bua lintho tse ntle tse lekaneng ka eona.
It's time for him to speak.	Ke nako ya hore a bue.
In this one thing needs something else to exist.	Ho sena ntho e le 'ngoe e hloka ntho e' ngoe hore e be teng.
People would never forget.	Batho ba ne ba ke ke ba lebala.
We believe they are not.	Re lumela hore ha ba joalo.
He would see them all.	O ne a tla ba bona kaofela.
But no one else can.	Empa ha ho motho e mong ea ka e etsang.
It could happen tomorrow.	E ka etsahala hosane.
I wondered how long he had been waiting for us.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na o re emetse nako e kae.
Enjoy it.	Ho e thabela ka.
But that is no longer the case.	Empa ha ho sa le joalo.
Most of the people there did not want that.	Batho ba bangata ba moo ba ne ba sa batle seo.
It was necessary.	E ne e hlokahala.
He enjoyed the idea.	O ile a thabela mohopolo oo.
Really fun times.	Ka sebele linako tse monate.
I do not have it.	Ha ke na eona.
I can't get in.	Ha ke khone ho kena.
But most people do not do that.	Empa batho ba bangata ha ba etse joalo.
But he was just an old psychologist.	Empa e ne e le setsebi sa kelello feela sa khale.
I feel very good.	Ke ikutloa hantle haholo.
Which is a mistake.	E leng phoso.
There is.	Ho na le.
We will be there soon.	Re tla be re le teng haufinyane.
People often spoke well.	Hangata batho ba ne ba bolela hantle.
Something else to try.	Ntho e 'ngoe hape eo u lokelang ho e leka.
They agreed that they could not have children.	Ba ile ba lumela hore ba ke ke ba ba le bana.
She wondered what he looked like.	A ipotsa hore na o shebahala joang.
You will do this now.	U tla etsa sena hona joale.
I need to find something.	Ke hloka ho fumana ho hong.
We had wonderful times together.	Re bile le linako tse monate hammoho.
Finally he stood up.	Qetellong a ema ka maoto.
Unless you.	Ntle le haeba o.
But it was still difficult.	Empa ho ne ho ntse ho le thata.
Until it is too late.	Ho fihlela e se e le morao haholo.
We’ll start with the legs and feet, too.	Re tla qala ka maoto le maoto, hape.
I wanted to go with him.	Ke ne ke batla ho tsamaea le eena.
You are important.	U bohlokoa.
He asked some questions.	O ile a botsa lipotso tse ling.
Love the memory.	Rata mohopolo.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
And it is very powerful.	'Me e matla haholo.
But no one is coming.	Empa ha ho motho ea tla.
So it starts.	Kahoo e qala.
We take great care of the children.	Re hlokomela bana haholo.
Every family hopes to have a son.	Lelapa le leng le le leng le tšepa ho ba le mora.
However, it is still the case at the time.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ntse ho le joalo ka nako eo.
But they are still suggesting an opportunity.	Empa ba ntse ba fana ka maikutlo a monyetla.
You like this.	O rata sena.
They usually lived there.	Hangata ba ne ba lula moo.
And it seems to work.	'Me e bonahala e sebetsa.
Think of me as you like.	Nahana ka 'na kamoo u ratang kateng.
He told me he would take care of it.	O ile a mpolella hore o tla e hlokomela.
If it is good, people will buy it.	Haeba e ntle, batho ba tla reka.
I was saying, this is so fun.	Ke ne ke re, sena se monate haholo.
This house felt that way.	Ntlo ena e ne e ikutloa joalo.
Now I am very happy.	Hona joale ke thabile haholo.
He drank heavily.	O ne a noa haholo.
But many did not.	Empa ba bangata ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
His car has seen better days.	Koloi ea hae e bone matsatsi a betere.
So it was not easy.	Kahoo ho ne ho se bonolo.
The same thing happened to another woman.	Ho ile ha etsahala se tšoanang ka mosali e mong.
They want to be a family.	Ba batla ho ba lelapa.
I would not take it.	Ke ne nke ke ka e nka.
They also work fast.	Le tsona li sebetsa kapele.
He never did.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo.
He seemed to have so many things.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka o na le lintho tse ngata haholo.
What’s so amazing about it? 	Ke eng e makatsang ka eona?
I like my beautiful picture.	Ke rata setšoantšo se setle sa ka.
It makes us.	E re etsa.
I feel good about it.	Ke ikutloa hantle ka eona.
You like a certain image or feeling about yourself.	U rata setšoantšo kapa maikutlo a itseng ka uena.
No one was in danger.	Ha ho le ea mong ea neng a le kotsing.
I'm not sure what to do with that.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore ke etse eng ka seo.
He checked the time.	O ile a sheba nako.
Or how the situation happened.	Kapa hore na boemo bo ile ba etsahala joang.
They can't do everything.	Ba ke ke ba etsa tsohle.
Hopefully we'll get back to it tomorrow.	Re tšepa hore re tla khutlela ho eona hosane.
The fact is that they do not exist.	'Nete ke hore ha li eo.
It was a powerful thing.	E ne e le ntho e matla.
Her beautiful hair was there.	Moriri oa hae o motle o ne o le teng.
He too.	Le eena hape.
You will not get bad food.	U ke ke ua fumana lijo tse mpe.
But you can't go with us.	Empa u ke ke ua tsamaea le rona.
I don't think that's the case.	Ha ke nahane hore ho joalo ke molao.
Work is hard, but it is necessary.	Mosebetsi o boima, empa oa hlokahala.
Just look.	Sheba feela.
Do it slowly.	Etsa hanyane le hanyane.
A really nice person.	Motho e motle ruri.
But even that did not work.	Empa le seo ha sea ka sa sebetsa.
We never talked about it again.	Ha rea ​​ka ra hlola re bua ka eona hape.
I still love to visit him, you know.	Ke ntse ke rata ho mo etela, ua tseba.
Just tell us when we will arrive.	Re bolelle feela hore na re tla fihla neng.
It can go both ways, too.	E ka tsamaea ka bobeli, hape.
Maybe you're in your night time.	Mohlomong u nakong ea hau ea bosiu.
It would stop, he thought.	E ne e tla ema, a nahana.
That is exactly the reason.	Ke lona lebaka hantle.
It's easy to get out of here.	Ho bonolo ho tloha mona.
If you need anything.	Haeba u hloka eng kapa eng.
If they love you, you will love them too.	Haeba ba li rata, le uena u tla li rata.
But in the end he did.	Empa qetellong o ile a etsa joalo.
This place has that.	Sebaka sena se na le seo.
Do not use.	U se ke ua sebelisa.
He rode a bicycle.	O ile a palama baesekele.
I did not see this.	Ha kea bona sena.
Or that was it.	Kapa seo e ne e le sona.
I took what they would need.	Ke nkile seo ba tla se hloka.
What else could be?	Ke eng hape e ka bang teng?
Things would go their own way.	Lintho li ne li tla tsamaea ka tsela ea tsona.
It was our thing.	E ne e le ntho ya rona.
It may all have been true.	E ka 'na eaba kaofela e ne e le 'nete.
This would not work.	Sena se ne se ke ke sa sebetsa.
Time passes quickly.	Nako ea feta kapele.
It's not easy, but it's easy.	Ha ho bonolo, empa ho bonolo.
He continued to walk.	O ile a tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
Thank you.	Kea leboha.
He did a great job.	O entse mosebetsi o motle.
Once last night, and now again.	Hang maobane bosiu, le jwale hape.
I am here to see my father.	Ke mona ho tla bona ntate.
People are caught up in this.	Batho ba tšoeroe ka sena.
It is almost impossible to live without water.	Ho batla ho le thata ho phela ntle le metsi.
Just reading about them will not help.	Ho bala feela ka bona ho ke ke ha thusa.
All, of course.	Kaofela, ehlile.
I did not apply.	Ha kea ka ka kopa.
He did not know what he was doing.	O ne a sa tsebe seo a se etsang.
To other people.	Ho batho ba bang.
Thank you so much for your thought.	Ke leboha haholo ka mohopolo oa hau.
It does not seem so.	Ha ho bonahale joalo.
That is no longer true.	Seo ha se sa le 'nete.
I know it's bad for me.	Kea tseba hore ho mpe ho nna.
I can see no way.	Ha ke bone tsela ya letho.
The police never found out where they went.	Ha ho mohla mapolesa a kileng a fumana moo a ileng teng.
But this we cannot do.	Empa sena ha re khone ho se etsa.
Yes, that was it.	E, e ne e le ntho eo.
And I know it's good for him.	Hape kea tseba hore ho molemo ho eena.
I think the man is trying.	Ke nahana hore monna o leka.
Too bad.	E mpe haholo.
It will ask to find your location.	E tla kopa ho fumana sebaka sa hau.
I hope to see you soon.	Ke tšepa ho u bona haufinyane.
People are already going there.	Batho ba se ba ntse ba ea moo.
I have better things to do with my mind.	Ke na le lintho tse betere tseo nka li etsang ka kelello ea ka.
You do not see them until you start looking for them.	Ha u li bone ho fihlela u qala ho li batla.
And from me.	Le ho tsoa ho 'na.
It has a problem.	E na le bothata.
And they did.	'Me ba entse joalo.
So find a way to do it.	Kahoo fumana mokhoa oa ho e etsa.
It’s just every day of my life.	Ke feela letsatsi le leng le le leng la bophelo ba ka.
The phone is ringing, ringing, ringing.	Mohala oa lla, oa lla, oa lla.
Before bedtime.	Pele ho nako ea ho robala.
He continued to write.	O ile a tsoela pele ho ngola.
Life was living a life.	Bophelo bo ne bo phela ka bophelo.
I do not want my son to do what you do.	Ha ke batle hore mora oa ka a etse seo u se etsang.
This makes the shoes very comfortable.	Sena se etsa lieta tse ntle haholo.
He was here and now.	O ne a le teng mona le hona joale.
It can be a very bad thing.	E ka ba ntho e mpe haholo.
Very happening.	E etsahalang haholo.
The important thing is to read every day.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke ho bala letsatsi le leng le le leng.
He probably would not have felt the same way about anyone.	Mohlomong o ne a ke ke a ikutloa joalo ka mang kapa mang.
They are going very well.	Ba ntse ba tsamaea hantle haholo.
It is also human life.	Hape ke bophelo ba motho.
Take care of your children.	Hlokomela bana ba hao.
He has a hard head.	O na le hlooho e thata.
It's bad too.	E mpe le eona.
Our performance with what we have.	Ho etsa ha rona ka seo re nang le sona.
It is their way of life.	Ke tsela ya bona ya bophelo.
This can offer something even more fun.	Sena se ka fana ka ntho e monate ho feta.
And today it did.	Mme kajeno e entse jwalo.
Yes, everyone knew it well.	E, bohle ba ne ba e tseba hantle.
I just got one.	Ke sa tsoa ba e mong.
They do it in my name.	Ba e etsa ka lebitso la ka.
But they did, and here we are.	Empa ba entse joalo, 'me re teng.
He never liked this teacher.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a rata tichere ena.
This will not help people.	Sena se ke ke sa thusa batho.
But maybe some people don't like it.	Empa mohlomong batho ba bang ha ba e rate.
I knew he had done it before.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o kile a etsa joalo.
That is very powerful.	Seo se matla haholo.
They'll know you were here.	Ba tla tseba hore o ne o le teng mona.
He began to think emotionally.	O ile a qala ho nahana ka maikutlo.
That will be fun.	Hoo ho tla ba monate.
They were not sure if they had ever had it.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe hantle hore na ba kile ba ba le eona.
However, it was not my money, and it was what he wanted.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se chelete ea ka, ’me e ne e le seo a neng a se batla.
For us, news is news.	Ho rona, litaba ke litaba.
He was useless.	O ne a se na thuso.
We will have a party.	Re tla etsa mokete.
You do not want to do this.	Ha o batle ho etsa sena.
It would be a long time before that happened.	Ho ne ho tla nka nako e telele pele seo se etsahala.
Yes of course.	Ehlile ho joalo.
I stood up.	Ke ile ka ema ka maoto.
However, that is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, hase 'nete.
It seemed.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka.
Look at the picture.	Sheba setšoantšo.
We have seen it live on in man.	Re e bone e phela le ka motho.
This is not enough.	Sena ha sea lekana.
Will this work?	Na see se tla sebetsa?
This is normal.	Sena ke sa kamehla.
Then they were here.	Joale ba ne ba le mona.
We wish we had spent the day there.	Re lakatsa eka re ka be re ile ra qeta letsatsi moo.
We all need that from time to time.	Kaofela re hloka seo nako le nako.
Like this here.	Joalo ka sena mona.
Maybe you couldn’t.	Mohlomong u ne u sa khone.
I have not eaten it.	Ha kea e ja.
It’s my life, your life, anyone’s life.	Ke bophelo ba ka, bophelo ba hao, bophelo ba mang kapa mang.
Or maybe you.	Kapa mohlomong uena.
It was not that kind of thing.	E ne e se ntho ea mofuta oo.
I just left my team.	Ke sa tsoa tlohela sehlopha sa ka.
He had to get out of here.	O ile a tlameha ho tsoa mona.
Anyway, what do I tell you.	Leha ho le joalo, ke u bolella eng.
Real work.	Mosebetsi oa sebele.
You had time to really be a doctor, to get to know them.	U ne u e-na le nako ea ho ba ngaka ka sebele, ho ba tseba.
Do not talk to them!	U se ke ua bua le bona!
So he returns.	Kahoo oa khutla.
That doesn't make sense.	Seo ha se etse kelello.
Then we finally found it.	Eaba qetellong re e fumana.
It never did us any good.	Ha ho mohla o kileng oa re etsa letho.
My son is not with me.	Mora oa ka ha a na le 'na.
We would do the same.	Re ne re tla etsa se tšoanang.
It can be any time of day.	E ka ba nako efe kapa efe ea letsatsi.
We should try to understand his point of view.	Re lokela ho leka ho utloisisa maikutlo a hae.
Every now and then.	Nako le nako .
You will probably do it for real.	Mohlomong o tla e etsa ka ’nete.
We'll see how tomorrow goes.	Re tla bona hore na hosane ho ea joang.
However, the problem lies in this approach.	Leha ho le joalo, bothata bo teng ka mokhoa ona.
It is useless to look.	Ha ho na thuso ho sheba.
You never thought it wasn't yours.	Ha o so ka o nahana hore ha se oa hau.
Maybe you can think of something?	Mohlomong u ka nahana ka ho hong?
I don't know where we got that from.	Ha ke tsebe hore na seo re se nkile kae.
There is something for everyone here.	Ho na le ho hong bakeng sa motho e mong le e mong mona.
We can leave you in it.	Re ka u tlohela ho eona.
Everyone is very happy about this.	E mong le e mong o thabile haholo ka sena.
Do what you can.	Etsa seo u ka se khonang.
But a lot of things happen that should not happen.	Empa ho etsahala lintho tse ngata tse sa lokelang ho etsahala.
It was not fun.	Ho ne ho se monate.
But this is nothing new to them.	Empa sena hase ntho e ncha ho bona.
This was it.	Ena e ne e le eona.
It is the best.	E molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Better without it.	Molemo ntle le eona.
Of course he can.	Ehlile a ka etsa joalo.
It’s kind of everything.	Ke mofuta oa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
I have my money.	Ke na le chelete ea ka.
I cried.	Ke ile ka lla.
He also gives his opinion.	Hape o fana ka maikutlo a hae.
And there he sat down.	Mme moo a dula.
I don't see how he could have survived.	Ha ke bone hore na o ne a ka phela joang.
That it was time.	Hore e ne e le nako.
More to come is clear.	Tse ling tse tlang ho hlakile.
We've seen that.	Re bone seo.
That's just fine.	Ke hantle feela.
Keep thinking.	Ba lule ba nahana.
This is the last question.	Ena ke potso ea ho qetela.
This house had everything we needed while we were there.	Ntlo ena e ne e e-na le ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe eo re e hlokang ha re ntse re le moo.
But you heard it here.	Empa u utloile mona.
You can play.	U ka bapala.
Getting to and fro was not easy.	Ho tla le ho tsamaea ho ne ho se bonolo.
Find an expert here.	Fumana setsebi mona.
We have dinner.	Re na le lijo tsa mantsiboea.
It took so long to walk through the area.	Ho ile ha nka nako e ngata hakaalo ho tsamaea sebakeng seo.
The problem was whether.	Bothata e ne e le hore na.
Nothing happened to him.	Ha ho letho le etsahetseng ho eena.
We will try it.	Re tla e leka.
First, they were together.	Pele, ba ne ba le hammoho.
Of course, they have been treated that way before.	Ehlile, ba kile ba tšoaroa joalo.
I have to help.	Ke tlameha ho thusa.
Either way you get out of it right.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe o tsoa ho eona hantle.
We are all ours.	Re ba rona kaofela.
Never, as long as he lives.	Le ka mohla, ha a ntse a phela.
It still exists.	E ntse e le teng.
They certainly will not do any good work.	Ruri ba ke ke ba etsa mosebetsi ofe kapa ofe hantle.
Everyone forgets.	Motho e mong le e mong oa lebala.
I looked at everything.	Ke ile ka sheba ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
If it works, fine.	Haeba e sebetsa, e ntle.
He was obviously expecting a question.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a lebeletse potso ena.
It was the most amazing thing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang ka ho fetisisa.
You look like her even more now, with your hair like that.	U shebahala joaloka eena le ho feta joale, ka moriri oa hau joalo.
Well, of course it will.	Be, ehlile ho tla ba joalo.
I can't be a caller today.	Ha ke khone ho ba mohala kajeno.
They don't know what it is.	Ha ba tsebe hore na ke eng.
I know it will take a long time, yes.	Kea tseba hore ho tla nka nako e telele, e.
Then he realized what had happened.	Eaba o hlokomela se etsahetseng.
He knows where his hands should be.	O tseba moo matsoho a hae a lokelang ho ba teng.
We don't even have to stay.	Ha rea ​​tlameha le ho lula.
We went to school today.	Re ile sekolong kajeno.
But that all is nothing.	Empa hore tsohle ha se letho.
He said nothing.	Ha aa ka a bua letho.
He did not get there after that.	Ha aa ka a fihla moo ka mor'a taba eo.
Write now.	Ngola hona joale.
But he was able to make money.	Empa o ne a khona ho etsa ka chelete.
Most people leave early in the morning.	Batho ba bangata ba tsamaea esale hoseng.
He just gave you a way to do that.	O sa tsoa u fa mokhoa oa ho etsa joalo.
There is a reason.	Ho na le lebaka.
I would have to refuse.	Ke ne ke tla tlameha ho hana.
I did not get a job because of this.	Ha kea ka ka fumana mosebetsi ka lebaka la sena.
And they will never meet again.	Mme ha ba sa tla kopana hape.
You must speak well of this.	U tlameha ho bua hantle ka sena.
It was a bit hard to understand.	Ho ne ho batla ho le thata ho utloisisa.
However, it does not seem likely at the time.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho bonahale ho ka etsahala ka nako eo.
You probably will not understand this.	Mohlomong u ke ke ua utloisisa sena.
He could leave at any moment.	O ne a ka tsamaea neng kapa neng.
Don't think anything.	U se ke ua nahana letho.
We were not there.	Re ne re le sieo.
And he is still with me.	Mme o ntse a na le nna.
We don't need any more.	Ha re hloke ho feta moo.
Today he did what he first did.	Kajeno o entse ntho eo a neng a qala ho e etsa.
She was the only girl in the group.	E ne e le eena feela ngoanana sehlopheng seo.
The week will be good for many.	Beke e tla ba molemo ho ba bangata.
I was in a car accident.	Ke ne ke le kotsing ea koloi.
He returned to school later.	O ile a khutla sekolong ka mor’a nako.
It is very close to them.	E haufi le bona hantle.
So how are we going? '	Joale re tsamaea joang?'
That time is gone.	Nako eo e ile.
You ask him.	Ua mo botsa.
Seeing them is so much fun.	Ho bona ho le monate haholo.
It's someone else.	Ke motho e mong.
He did it, you know.	O e entse, le a tseba.
I was grateful that she kept her clothes.	Ke ile ka leboha hore ebe o ile a boloka liaparo tsa hae.
They didn't care.	Ba ne ba sa tsotelle.
He was powerless.	O ne a sena matla.
Valuable income.	Chelete ea bohlokoa.
I was expecting that.	Ke ne ke lebeletse seo.
This can be a powerful emotion.	Ena e ka ba maikutlo a matla.
It certainly is here.	Ka sebele ho joalo mona.
He was sure he was waiting for it and it was good.	O ne a na le bonnete ba hore o e emetse mme ho ne ho le molemo.
There must be people.	Ho tlameha hore ho be le batho.
That was his old life.	Boo e ne e le bophelo ba hae ba khale.
We are still good friends.	Re ntse re le metsoalle e molemo.
I can't do it.	Ha ke khone ho e etsa.
But no, that should not be the case.	Empa che, ho ne ho sa lokela ho ba joalo.
However, tonight was fun.	Leha ho le joalo, bosiung bona ho ne ho le monate.
But we would be together soon.	Empa re ne re tla ba hammoho haufinyane.
There was no one else in the group.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong sehlopheng seo.
It was just not important.	E ne e mpa e se ea bohlokoa.
Watch what you do.	Sheba seo u se etsang.
No one was injured.	Ha ho le ea mong ea ileng a tsoa kotsi.
However, this is a very external opportunity.	Leha ho le joalo, ona ke monyetla o ka ntle haholo.
But back to my point.	Empa khutlela ho maikutlo a ka.
No, stop.	Che, ema.
But they had mine, too.	Empa ba ne ba ena le ya ka, le bona.
See what people think of you at the time.	Bona seo batho ba se nahanang ka uena ka nako eo.
But that will not be easy.	Mme seo se ka se be bonolo.
It was legal work.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa molao.
I enjoyed that.	Ke ile ka thabela seo.
We are very important for that.	Re bohlokoa haholo bakeng sa seo.
It will make everything easier.	E tla etsa hore ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e be bonolo haholoanyane.
I played a few.	Ke ile ka bapala tse 'maloa.
As a result, he was wealthy.	Ka lebaka leo, o ne a e-na le chelete e ngata.
It's time for me to go too.	Ke nako ea hore le 'na ke tsamaee.
He was the first to speak.	Ke eena ea buileng pele.
I believe so.	Ke lumela hore ho joalo.
Go ahead!	Tsoela pele!
Then, the true work begins.	Joale, mosebetsi oa 'nete oa qala.
It was a mistake.	E ne e le phoso.
That's what we're talking about.	Ke seo re se buang.
So you can start doing it.	Kahoo u ka qala ho e etsa.
However, they are too many.	Leha ho le joalo, ba bangata haholo.
And they loved it.	Mme ba ne ba e rata.
I don't want to let him go.	Ha ke batle ho mo tlohela hore a tsamaee.
Maybe they'll come back at the end.	Mohlomong ba tla khutla qetellong.
We'll talk about it and then we can go.	Re tla bua ka eona ebe joale re ka tsamaea.
So thank you for what you have.	Kahoo leboha seo u nang le sona.
People passed by.	Batho ba ile ba feta.
It is difficult to comprehend what they went through.	Ho thata ho utloisisa seo ba fetileng ho sona.
She loves it.	O a e rata.
Clearly, he loved the work.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a rata mosebetsi oo.
He really loves you, you know.	O hlile oa u rata, ua tseba.
And it was fun, you know.	Mme ho ne ho le monate, le a tseba.
He likes to plan.	O rata ho rera.
Have you heard anything about him?	Na u kile ua utloa letho ka eena?
I would never try it again.	Ke ne nke ke ka e leka hape.
I love you, girl.	Kea u rata, ngoanana.
They could not make a mistake.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba etsa phoso.
Will we leave tonight?	Re tla tloha bosiung bona?
Get an idea of ​​it.	Fumana maikutlo a eona.
It could have been better.	E ka be e bile betere.
We believe they are.	Re lumela hore ba joalo.
We did not know it.	Re ne re sa o tsebe.
We do not have to make this decision.	Re sa tlameha ho etsa qeto ena.
You can know who you are.	U ka tseba hore na u mang.
They refuse to go.	Ba hana ho ea.
Unfortunately, no one was left behind.	Ka masoabi, ho ne ho ke ke ha hlola ho e-ba le batho ka mor’a hae.
It was really fun to watch.	Ho ne ho le monate ho shebella ha e le hantle.
Nothing outside.	Ha ho letho le ka ntle.
Hold my hands.	Tšoara matsoho a ka.
She seems to like it.	O bonahala a e rata.
Same situation, but with a car.	Boemo bo tšoanang, empa o na le koloi.
We know what they did.	Re tseba seo ba se entseng.
I'm happy to start again.	Ke thabetse ho qala hape.
They enjoyed him as a person.	Ba ne ba mo thabetse e le motho.
This is not a priority.	Sena ha se ntho e tlang pele.
Family can be very important to a person.	Lelapa e ka ba la bohlokoa haholo ho motho.
And he comes and knows.	Mme o a tla mme o a tseba.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
I can see why you keep it so long.	Kea bona hore na ke hobane'ng ha u e boloka nako e telele.
He once had it.	O kile a ba le eona.
Of course.	Leha e le hantle.
They do not exist.	Ha li eo.
He had not said enough.	O ne a eso bue ho lekaneng.
Now be very careful.	Jwale hlokomela haholo.
I found our boy here.	Ke fumane moshanyana oa rona mona.
I'm sorry to say that, but it's true.	Ke masoabi ho bua joalo, empa ke 'nete.
That's a bad thing.	Ke taba e mpe.
You can't imagine it.	U ke ke ua e nahana.
We are not that strong.	Ha re matla hakaalo.
Of course, it has been that way for a long time.	Ehlile, esale ho le joalo ka nako e telele.
However, they still have their problems.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ntse ba e-na le mathata a bona.
It was just them or me.	E ne e mpa e le bona kapa nna.
Because he could do this.	Hobane o ne a ka etsa sena.
Yet we would do it.	Leha ho le joalo re ne re tla e etsa.
We bought a group.	Re ne re reka sehlopha.
You did the same.	Le uena u entse joalo.
I have an idea.	Ke na le mohopolo.
He treated her like a child.	O ne a mo tšoara joalo ka ngoana.
The same is true here.	Ho joalo le mona.
The danger here is psychological.	Kotsi mona ke ea kelello.
We watch them.	Re ba shebella.
They will never do that.	Ha ho mohla ba tla etsa joalo.
It's a very strange thing to me.	Ke ntho e makatsang haholo ho nna.
Others, who knows?	Ba bang, ke mang ea tsebang?
He had done his job well.	O ne a entse mosebetsi wa hae hantle.
I think he did.	Ke nahana hore o entse joalo.
Keep learning new things.	Tsoela pele ho ithuta lintho tse ncha.
I don't really understand why you can do that.	Ha ke utloisise hantle hore na ke hobane'ng ha u ka etsa joalo.
Thank you for your help, of course.	Ke leboha thuso ea hau, ka 'nete.
I’m working on something that needed a day of last week to work today.	Ke ntse ke sebetsa ka ntho e hlokang letsatsi la beke e fetileng ho sebetsa kajeno.
It will not be good for you.	Ho ke ke ha ba molemo ho uena.
I see what you are doing.	Ke bona seo o se etsang.
The children were thrilled to see their mother.	Bana ba ne ba thabetse ho bona ’mè oa bona.
His departure also could not survive.	Ho tsamaea ha hae hape o ne a ke ke a phela.
The usual is no.	Ea kamehla ke che.
Assume we have that.	Nka hore re na le hore.
It's not fun.	Ha ho monate.
But he did not need anything.	Empa o ne a sa hloke letho.
The child cannot even speak now.	Ngoana ha a khone le ho bua hona joale.
Yes, he loved her.	Ee, o ne a mo rata.
They kept going.	Ba ile ba tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
I can work with that.	Nka sebetsa le seo.
It just can't happen.	E mpa e ke ke ea etsahala.
It just has to.	E tlameha feela.
I will do only one.	Ke tla etsa e le 'ngoe feela.
The matter is ongoing.	Taba e ntse e tsoela pele.
Yes, it still is.	E, ho ntse ho le joalo.
You get coffee.	U fumana kofi.
I like not to know.	Ke rata ho se tsebe.
There were many of them.	Ho ne ho e-na le ba bangata ba bona.
Good for both of them.	Molemo bakeng sa bobeli ba bona.
If not now, when ?.	Haeba e se hona joale, neng?.
But he did not get a chance.	Empa ha a ka a fumana monyetla.
This is the only one.	Ena ke eona feela.
We need to go beyond that.	Re hloka ho feta moo.
But, for some reason we didn't play together.	Empa, ka lebaka le itseng ha rea ​​ka ra bapala hammoho.
Which it is today.	E leng sona kajeno.
Today is the first day of my whole life.	Kajeno ke letsatsi la pele la bophelo bohle ba ka.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
You need to get out of there.	U hloka ho tsoa moo.
And crying more.	Le ho lla ho feta.
He needed strength.	O ne a hloka matla.
All our lives.	Bophelo bohle ba rona.
And indeed, he is.	Mme ruri, o ntse a le teng.
I like this place.	Ke rata sebaka sena.
Here he is alone with his son.	Mona ke eena feela le mora oa hae.
And it is very good.	'Me e ntle haholo.
I have a lot of books.	Ke na le libuka tse ngata.
He lived and loved here.	O ne a lula a bile a rata mona.
The worst would be if he could come.	Ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa e ka ba haeba a ka tla.
But it is a good idea.	Empa ke mohopolo o motle.
Yes, they are.	E, ba teng.
I worked hard.	Ke ile ka sebetsa ka thata.
I did not want to leave.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho tsamaea.
You were with him to the end.	U ne u e-na le eena ho fihlela qetellong.
There are other factors to consider.	Ho na le lintho tse ling tseo u lokelang ho nahana ka tsona.
He didn't care about me.	O ne a se na taba le nna.
It was easy.	Ho ne ho le bonolo.
The only way is to love him.	Tsela feela ke ho mo rata.
You have to go to school every day.	U tlameha ho ea sekolong letsatsi le leng le le leng.
This, for me, is a very tasty meal.	Sena, ho 'na, ke lijo tse monate haholo.
No one told her anything.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo bolella letho.
We think you are very good.	Re nahana hore o motle haholo.
And again, we did it.	Mme hape, re ile ra e etsa.
He also looks better to me.	Le 'na o shebahala a le betere ho 'na.
He was the first.	E ne e le eena oa pele.
The point is, we do not have enough water.	Taba ke hore ha re na metsi a lekaneng.
That is something to be thankful for.	Ke ntho eo re lokelang ho e leboha.
We are a man and a woman.	Re monna le mosali.
So there is a lot going on here.	Kahoo ho na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang mona.
They could go on.	Ba ne ba ka tsoela pele.
The car drove away.	Koloi eo e ile ea tsamaea.
This is not very fun.	Sena ha se monate haholo.
I asked him.	Ke ile ka mo botsa.
She would be fine now.	O ne a tla phela hantle jwale.
It's also fun.	Hape e monate.
So do what you need to do before you need it.	Kahoo, etsa seo u se hlokang pele u se hloka.
He needed to eat more.	O ne a hloka ho ja ho feta.
You know where everything is.	U tseba moo tsohle li leng teng.
We were there at about the same time.	Re ne re le teng hoo e ka bang ka nako e tšoanang.
Your time is coming.	Nako ea hao ea tla.
This decides.	Sena se etsa qeto.
We are not here.	Ha re eo.
You just said that.	U sa tsoa bua joalo.
You know that now.	O tseba seo ha jwale.
However, it was difficult to move quickly.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le thata ho tsamaea kapele.
I did not wear anything.	Ha ke a apara letho le leng.
It would be his job.	E ne e tla be e le mosebetsi wa hae.
Maybe one day it would be.	Mohlomong ka letsatsi le leng ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
Anyone has an opinion.	Mang kapa mang o na le maikutlo.
I'm really sorry.	Ruri ke masoabi.
He felt better that way.	O ile a ikutloa a le betere ka tsela eo.
About here, sorry.	Hoo e ka bang mona, masoabi.
Nice to meet you.	Ke thabetse ho kopana le uena.
You are making a mistake.	O etsa phoso.
Of course, it will not be strong.	Ha e le hantle, e ke ke ea e-ba matla.
So, you did nothing wrong.	Ka hona, ha ua etsa letho le phoso.
Stop as he does so.	Ema ha a ntse a etsa joalo.
Really nice.	Ka sebele e ntle haholo.
But here is an even worse story.	Empa mona ke taba e mpe le ho feta.
Somehow he knew.	Ka tsela e itseng o ne a tseba.
They talk about where the road will go tomorrow.	Ba bua ka hore na hosane tsela e tla ea kae.
It doesn't matter to me.	Ha ho na taba ho nna.
She was fine.	O ne a le hantle.
Doing it is hard work.	Ho e etsa ke mosebetsi o boima.
You may or may not need to do this.	U ka 'na ua hloka ho etsa sena kapa ua se ke ua hloka.
He thought he knew it.	O ne a nahana hore o e tseba.
I don’t know if we can win.	Ha ke tsebe hore na re ka hlola.
But some do not know much.	Empa ba bang ha ba tsebe hakaalo.
No one talks about it for that reason.	Ha ho motho ea buang ka eona ka lebaka leo.
And you can't do anything about this.	'Me u ke ke ua etsa letho ka sena.
So they would know.	Kahoo ba ne ba tla tseba.
We are in the same class at school.	Re sehlopheng se le seng sekolong.
They have no money of any kind.	Ha ba na chelete ea mofuta ofe kapa ofe.
They could not do enough for you.	Ba ne ba sitoa ho u etsetsa se lekaneng.
Tell them what happened.	Ba bolelle se etsahetseng.
I will know now.	Ke tla tseba hona joale.
I got a letter.	Ke fumane lengolo.
I can live without that.	Nka phela ntle le seo.
As it was.	Joalo ka ha ho ne ho le teng.
They did not go.	Ba ne ba sa tsamaee.
That will be even more so in the future.	Ho tla ba joalo le ho feta nakong e tlang.
It is necessary to start early and finish on time.	Hoa hlokahala ho qala kapele le ho qeta ka nako.
To do what you want.	Ho etsa seo o se batlang.
His family was with him.	Lelapa la hae le ne le e-na le eena.
My father caught a few.	Ntate o ile a tšoara tse seng kae.
I had never been there.	Ke ne ke eso be teng.
That is where we are now.	Ke hona moo re leng teng hona joale.
People often like to have food fast.	Hangata batho ba rata hore lijo li be kapele.
If you think you have what you need.	Haeba u nahana hore u na le seo u se hlokang.
Maybe you do too.	Mohlomong le uena u na le eona.
I talk to him almost every day.	Ke bua le eena hoo e ka bang letsatsi le leng le le leng.
You will find it soon.	O tla e fumana haufinyane.
There are many who come my way every day.	Ho na le ba bangata ba tlang ka tsela ea ka letsatsi le letsatsi.
No one will notice.	Ha ho motho ea tla hlokomela.
Do whatever you have to do.	Etsa eng kapa eng eo u lokelang ho e etsa.
Maybe they are not sure what they know.	Mohlomong ha ba na bonnete ba seo ba se tsebang.
You just get it.	O e fumana feela.
There is only one thing wrong with it.	Ho na le ntho e le 'ngoe feela e mpe ka eona.
I'm just sorry.	Ke masoabi feela.
That would have been difficult.	Seo se ka be se bile thata.
I even applied to.	Ke bile ka etsa kopo ho.
I'm sorry.	Ke masoabi.
That’s what the team does.	Ke seo sehlopha se se etsang.
It is very important to them.	E bohlokoa haholo ho bona.
When do you expect to return?	U lebeletse ho khutla neng?
You were absent.	U ne u le sieo.
All we have so far is a name.	Sohle seo re nang le sona ho fihlela joale ke lebitso.
I have more than enough.	Ke na le ho feta ho lekaneng.
Sorry, everyone, he thought.	Ke masoabi, bohle, o ile a nahana.
When the doctor told her the news, she started to cry.	Ha ngaka e mo bolella litaba tseo, o ile a lla.
It is very difficult to do so.	Ho thata haholo ho etsa joalo.
I go from room to room.	Ke tloha kamoreng e 'ngoe ho ea ho e 'ngoe.
Or rather, he agreed.	Kapa ho e-na le hoo, o ile a lumela.
The same is true of his wife.	Ho joalo le ka mosali oa hae.
Not everyone would have it.	Hase bohle ba neng ba tla ba le eona.
This task is simple enough.	Mosebetsi ona o bonolo ka ho lekaneng.
I hope you are well.	Ke tšepa hore u hantle.
I went to where the party was.	Ke ile moo mokete o neng o le teng.
Do not stay too long.	U se ke ua lula nako e telele haholo.
They decided they had no chance.	Ba ile ba etsa qeto ea hore ha ba na monyetla.
You thought they needed it.	U ne u nahana hore baa e hloka.
The second did not suffer so much.	Ea bobeli ha ea ka ea utloa bohloko hakaalo.
He is very simple.	O bonolo haholo.
Everyone there knew him.	Bohle ba neng ba le moo ba ne ba mo tseba.
Here's how.	Mona ke mokhoa.
It was a very strange thing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang haholo.
If you do not know, ask.	Haeba u sa tsebe, botsa.
They can't keep it, they'll use it.	Ba ke ke ba e boloka, ba tla e sebelisa.
We must stand together or we will fall.	Re tlameha ho ema hammoho ho seng joalo re tla oa.
It is a place to meet your friends.	Ke sebaka sa ho kopana le metsoalle ea hau.
Everything takes time.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e hloka nako.
It is important to me.	E bohlokoa ho 'na.
He was not.	O ne a se joalo.
Let's talk a little bit.	Ha re bue hanyane.
I will not do it that way.	Ha ke tlo e etsa ka tsela eo.
But it did not matter then.	Empa ho ne ho se taba ka nako eo.
Not everyone has the mental capacity.	Ha se motho e mong le e mong ea nang le matla a kelello.
But something was terribly wrong.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ho phoso haholo.
He would see what it looked like.	O ne a tla bona hore na o shebahala joang.
It was fun.	Ho bile monate.
I'm glad to have it.	Ke thabetse ho ba le eona.
That works well.	Seo se sebetsa hantle.
I get that.	Ke fumana seo.
We may be too late.	Re ka nna ra ba morao haholo.
They are not as good at their job as anyone else.	Ha ba hloahloa mosebetsing oa bona joalo ka motho e mong.
They make the decision.	Ke bona ba etsang qeto.
Very good though.	E ntle haholo leha ho le joalo.
Now that's the way it is.	Joale ke mokhoa oo.
He did not know why.	O ne a sa tsebe lebaka.
Nice to be with you.	Ke thabetse ho ba le uena.
You can meet him there.	U ka kopana le eena moo.
Now there is another.	Hona joale ho na le e 'ngoe.
She's wearing old-fashioned clothes.	O ntse a apere liaparo tsa mokhoa oa khale.
Very well, of course.	Hantle haholo, ha e le hantle.
They work well here.	Ba sebetsa hantle mona.
Does the child feel that way?	Na ngoana o bona joalo?
But the truth must go on.	Empa 'nete e tlameha ho tsoela pele.
This seemed to make it better.	Sena se ne se bonahala se etsa hore e be betere.
I did not like that at all.	Ke ne ke sa rate seo ho hang.
I wonder at once who they are doing it to.	Kea ipotsa hang hore na ba e etsa ho mang.
I want to hear other people do things.	Ke batla ho utloa batho ba bang ba etsa lintho.
It did not happen very often.	Ha ea etsahala hangata.
I have not heard from them.	Ha kea utloa ho tsoa ho bona.
Walking as hard and fast as he can.	Ho tsamaea ka thata le kapele kamoo a ka khonang.
No one knew how powerful he was now.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba hore na o na le matla hakae hona joale.
I'm sorry about that.	Ke masoabi ka seo.
Soon you will see that everyone.	Haufinyane o tla bona hore mang kapa mang.
Good job.	Mosebetsi o motle.
He did not tell them that he would not return.	Ha aa ka a ba bolella hore ha a sa tla khutla.
I read it and thought it was fun.	Ke ile ka e bala 'me ka nahana hore e monate.
It looks amazingly good.	E shebahala e le ntle ka tsela e makatsang.
That will not be the case.	Ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
It's your job.	Ke mosebetsi oa hao.
They did not find it. 	Ha baa ka ba e fumana. 
Everyone got the same opportunity.	E mong le e mong o ile a fumana monyetla o tšoanang .
This last one is an important place for me.	Ena ea ho qetela ke sebaka sa bohlokoa ho nna.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore a ke ke a etsa joalo.
You don't have to be nice, here.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u be motle, mona.
This is a very difficult issue.	Taba ena e thata haholo.
This is very necessary.	Sena se hlokahala haholo.
His pain is clear.	Bohloko ba hae bo hlakile.
There was a lot of old money here.	Ho ne ho e-na le chelete e ngata ea khale mona.
He just says it is.	O bolela feela hore ho jwalo.
And don't think it's easy after thirty years.	'Me u se ke ua nahana hore ho bonolo ka mor'a lilemo tse mashome a mararo.
This issue is still very important.	Taba ena e ntse e le ea bohlokoa haholo.
Be very careful.	Hlokomela haholo.
He was no longer looking at her.	O ne a se a sa mo sheba.
It is a time for friends and family to be reunited.	Ke nako ea hore metsoalle le ba lelapa ba kopane.
I never thought about it again.	Ha kea ka ka nahana ka eona hape.
That would be fun.	Hoo ho ka ba monate.
To love it all.	Ho e rata kaofela.
However, he refused to use them.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a hana ho li sebelisa.
It seems pointless to ask again.	Ho bonahala ho se na thuso ho botsa hape.
But now, he had never left.	Empa joale, o ne a e-s'o ka a tsamaea.
To this day it really is.	Ho fihlela kajeno ehlile.
I did not find anything.	Ha kea ka ka fumana letho.
He made a lot of money too.	O entse chelete e ngata hape.
I wonder what you think of it.	Kea ipotsa hore na u nahana eng ka eona.
It always seems the same.	E bona e lekana kamehla.
For the first time, everyone was able to understand what he was saying.	Ka lekhetlo la pele, e mong le e mong o ile a khona ho utloisisa seo a se buang.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
We took it.	Re e nkile.
He knew, and he let them do it.	O ne a tseba, ’me a ba lumella ho e etsa.
I had to leave.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tsamaea.
It was easy to do.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho e etsa.
It may take some time.	Ho ka 'na ha nka nako.
From then on, they saw nothing.	Ho tloha moo, ba ne ba sa bone letho.
We did not do that.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
Which is something he didn't want to do, yet.	E leng seo a neng a sa batle ho se etsa, le jwale.
People were leaving the area and visiting.	Batho ba ne ba tloha sebakeng seo ’me ba etela.
I did not know.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe.
Write a lot.	Ngola haholo.
It remains to be seen whether that will happen.	Ho sa ntse ho tla bonahala hore na seo se tla etsahala.
They felt too difficult to continue working there.	Ba ne ba ikutloa ho le boima haholo hore ba ka tsoela pele ba sebetsa moo.
That's exactly what we want.	Ke ona mokhoa oo re o batlang hantle.
I was starting to feel so tired.	Ke ne ke qala ho ikutloa ke khathetse hakana.
Thank you thank you !.	Kea leboha kea leboha!.
He decided.	O ile a etsa qeto.
That is.	Ke hore.
All that matters is here and now.	Sohle se bohlokoa ke mona le hona joale.
You.	Wena.
I enjoy breakfast.	Ke li thabela lijo tsa hoseng.
He was ashamed to speak.	O ne a le lihlong ho bua.
That was a good decision.	Eo e ne e le qeto e ntle.
You have to be more careful.	O tlameha ho hlokomela ho feta.
He was busy.	O ne a phathahane.
Of course, if you are tired, you should sleep.	Ha e le hantle, haeba u khathetse, u lokela ho robala.
I was an adult.	Ke ne ke le moholo.
Things are bad there.	Lintho li mpe moo.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho joalo.
Can read and write.	O khona ho bala le ho ngola.
However, here we do not believe the law applies.	Leha ho le joalo, mona ha re lumele hore molao oa sebetsa.
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
You can use any.	U ka sebelisa leha e le efe.
This was very difficult for me to do.	Sena se ne se le boima haholo hore ke se etse.
But it works well for me.	Empa e sebetsa hantle ho nna.
And what he is not doing is not very good.	Mme seo a sa se etsang ha se setle haholo.
You have to understand them.	U tlameha ho li utloisisa.
The important thing is that they did.	Taba ea bohlokoa ke hore ba ile ba etsa joalo.
So, you don’t think.	Kahoo, ha u nahane.
He wanted to fix this.	O ne a batla ho lokisa sena.
It is usually busy, so read it in advance.	Hangata ho phathahane, kahoo bala esale pele.
Some do.	Ba bang ba etsa jwalo.
I try to figure out what he wants.	Ke leka ho nahana hore na o batla eng.
Start small, see how you go.	Qala hanyane, bona hore na u tsamaea joang.
We are still children.	Re ntse re le bana.
Maybe my Father's name will be in it.	Mohlomong lebitso la Ntate le tla ba ho eona.
He stood outside the restaurant.	O ile a ema ka ntle ho ntlo ea lijo.
Police said they had not.	Mapolesa a itse ha ba e-so.
Almost none of this happened.	Hoo e ka bang ha ho letho la sena le ileng la etsahala.
But it was clear that no one was there.	Empa ho hlakile hore ho ne ho se na motho.
And they are singing.	Mme baa bina.
The man could not stand alone.	Monna eo o ne a sa khone ho ema a le mong.
They will ask.	Ba tla kopa.
It will be there soon.	E tla ba teng haufinyane.
The point is, you need to know how to do it.	Taba ke hore u hloka ho tseba ho e etsa.
Certainly not tonight.	Ruri ha se bosiung bona.
It is better to be good.	Ho molemo ho ba molemo.
I did not want to forget it.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho e lebala.
And you didn't, either.	Mme ha o a ka wa etsa jwalo, le wena.
I saw what he could do.	Ke bone seo a ka se etsang.
But you have something more powerful.	Empa u na le ho hong ho matla ho feta.
Now is one of those times.	Hona joale ke e 'ngoe ea linako tseo.
This should never happen again.	Sena ha sea lokela ho etsahala hape.
I will find a way.	Ke tla fumana tsela.
We did not meet.	Ha rea ​​kopana.
Only his mother.	Mme wa hae feela.
That's my whole story.	Ke eona taba ea ka kaofela.
Nice to be here with you.	Ke thabetse ho ba mona le uena.
It's that simple.	E bonolo joalo.
Yet do not get the impression.	Leha ho le joalo u se ke ua fumana maikutlo.
So he had his ideas.	Kahoo o ne a e-na le maikutlo a hae.
It was a night of the week.	E ne e le bosiu ba beke.
He was absent from work, but was expecting a return soon.	O ne a le sieo ka mosebetsi, empa o ne a lebeletse ho khutla haufinyane.
If you need help with this look for a doctor.	Haeba u hloka thuso ka sena batla ngaka.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
Sometimes it is better.	Ka linako tse ling ho molemo.
Like him.	Joalo ka eena.
However, be careful.	Leha ho le joalo, hlokomela.
He, too, of course.	Le eena, ho hlakile.
It's up to you.	Ho ho wena.
I can't speak.	Ha ke khone ho bua.
I will need it.	Ke tla e hloka.
I'm almost busy.	Ke batla ke phathahane.
After that, things get worse.	Ka mor’a moo, lintho li ba thata le ho feta.
He had what he needed.	O ne a ena le seo a se hlokang.
It takes a lot of time.	Ho nka nako e ngata.
It all starts with him and comes through him.	Seo sohle se qala ka eena 'me se tla ka eena.
I was the last thing he ever saw.	Ke bile ntho ea ho qetela eo a kileng a e bona.
Very nice person to work with.	Motho ea motle haholo ho sebetsa le eena.
Because it's not me.	Hobane ha se nna.
We wanted to be with him.	Re ne re batla re e-na le eena.
He was the only one here who could see it.	E ne e le eena feela mona ea neng a khona ho e bona.
Even if he had been.	Leha a ka be a bile joalo.
It is not life.	Ha se bophelo.
It too was not very pleasant.	Le eona e ne e se monate haholo.
It really works.	E hlile ea sebetsa.
Something else to fix.	Ntho e 'ngoe hape ea ho lokisa.
The phone rings again.	Mohala oa lla hape.
I really had a problem with this.	Ke ne ke hlile ke na le bothata ka sena.
Can you believe he betrayed us?	Na u ka lumela hore o ile a re eka?
And he kept silent.	'Me a tsoela pele ho se bue.
That place would stand empty.	Sebaka seo se ne se tla ema se se na letho.
There was so much to learn.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo re lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
He seemed to be doing this for the rest of his life.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka esale a etsa sena bophelo bohle ba hae.
He began to drink heavily.	O ile a qala ho noa haholo.
Like three times.	Joalo ka makhetlo a mararo.
She is not the same woman.	Ha se mosali ea tšoanang.
Food was a real problem.	Lijo e ne e le bothata ba sebele.
What the issue is.	Taba ke efe.
Good job.	Mosebetsi o motle.
Which was too long.	E neng e le nako e telele haholo.
It would be a long time before he went through this.	Ho ne ho tla nka nako e telele pele a feta taba ena.
He knew what it would mean.	O ne a tseba hore na ho ne ho tla bolela eng.
I did not tell him.	Ha kea ka ka mo bolella.
What is easy to see may not be so easy for us.	Se bonolo ho bona se ka ’na sa se be bonolo hakaalo ho rōna.
He passes well.	O feta hantle.
We can't talk too much about that place.	Ha re khone ho bua haholo ka sebaka seo.
And nobody said anything.	Mme haho motho ya ileng a bua letho.
So we work on that.	Kahoo re sebetsa ka seo.
He was afraid to be alone.	O ne a tšaba ho ba mong.
I don’t think he can make a lot of money by doing that.	Ha ke nahane hore a ka etsa chelete e ngata ka ho etsa joalo.
He’s great, he’s an expert.	O moholo, ke setsebi.
I have never done it right.	Ha ke e-s'o ka ke e etsa hantle.
Then write something new.	Joale ho ngola ntho e ncha.
And, the rest of us.	Mme, rona ba bang.
However, that was not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se joalo.
We do not need your help.	Ha re hloke thuso ea hau.
I sit in the front.	Ke lula ka pele.
And then it happens again.	Mme ebe e etsahala hape.
I can't tell you what happened.	Ha ke tsebe ho le bolella se etsahetseng.
Without a lot of time to get there.	Ntle le nako e ngata ea ho fihla moo.
Besides, there was money.	Ntle ho moo, ho ne ho e-na le chelete.
Maybe I did this.	Mohlomong ke entse sena.
I believe our whole life will be much better.	Ke lumela hore bophelo bohle ba rona bo tla ba betere haholo.
I would love to work that way too.	Nka thabela ho sebetsa ka mokhoa oo hape.
No one should be here.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho ba mona.
Maybe he was really trying to help.	Mohlomong o ne a hlile a leka ho thusa.
The children are playing.	Bana ba ntse ba bapala.
It fits well.	E lekana hantle.
It has to be the same thing.	E lokela ho ba ntho e le 'ngoe.
However, that does not have to be.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho hlokahale hore ho be joalo.
He was older than life.	O ne a le moholo ho feta bophelo.
However, there are significant problems with this method.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le mathata a bohlokoa ka mokhoa ona.
Water may be necessary for life.	Metsi a ka ’na a hlokahala bakeng sa ho phela.
Not having a father.	Ho se be le ntate.
They have not found him.	Ha ba so mo fumane.
But it seems like someone has to think it could be.	Empa ho bonahala eka motho e mong o tlameha ho nahana hore ho ka ba joalo.
He refused to talk to me.	O ne a hana ho bua le nna.
Yes, that's just the way it is.	E, ho ba feela ho joalo.
He began to have trouble thinking.	O ile a qala ho ba le bothata ba ho nahana hantle.
And my wife I say that way.	Le mosali oa ka ke bua ka tsela eo.
The way they walk is something they shouldn’t get into.	Hore na ba tsamaea joang ke ntho e sa lokelang ho kena ho eona.
That’s something we would look at.	Ke ntho eo re neng re tla e sheba.
I must have worked hard as a child.	E tlameha ebe ke ne ke sebetsa ka thata ha ke sa le ngoana.
I did not know what to do.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe seo ke lokelang ho se etsa.
Then he can love her.	Joale a ka mo rata.
It was hard, very hard.	Ho ne ho le thata, ho le thata haholo.
They really do not know what they are talking about.	Ruri ha ba tsebe seo ba buang ka sona.
It does exist, though.	E teng, leha ho le joalo.
He soon forgot about that mistake.	Kapele o ile a lebala ka phoso eo.
I never thought he would spend a week.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore o tla qeta beke.
I will be able to meet.	Ke tla khona ho kopana.
He always writes well.	O ngola hantle kamehla.
I would do anything for them.	Ke ne ke tla ba etsetsa eng kapa eng.
Have you ever written a book?	A na u kile ua ngola buka?
Nothing will happen.	Haho letho le tlang ho etsahala.
He admitted his guilt to this writing team.	O ile a lumela molato oa hae sehlopheng sena sa ho ngola.
Then he goes in to talk with her.	Joale oa kena ho ea bua le eena.
That girl is so cute!	Ngoanana eo o monate haholo!
We've seen both.	Re bone bobeli.
No one even knew it existed.	Ho ne ho se motho ea tsebang le hore e teng.
Use common sense.	Sebelisa kelello.
But they look even stronger.	Empa li shebahala li le matla le ho feta.
In the first year, we did just that.	Selemong sa pele re ile ra etsa joalo.
Just looking ahead.	Ho sheba feela ka pele.
The more people talk about it, the better.	Ha batho ba bangata ba bua ka eona ho molemo.
And then they did.	Mme ebe ba etsa jwalo.
He walked.	O ile a tsamaea ka maoto.
However, going to work is a fact of life.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ea mosebetsing ke 'nete ea bophelo.
Do not open it.	U se ke ua e bula.
I don’t think that happens this year.	Ha ke nahane hore seo se etsahala selemong sena.
We left in the morning.	Re ile ra tsamaea hoseng.
He kept saying that.	A nna a bua jwalo.
He lives nearby.	O lula haufi le mona.
What happened to him?	Ho ile ha etsahala'ng ka eena?
As children, we said that we had a lot in common.	Ha re le bana, re ile ra re ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo re tšoanang ka tsona.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mohlomong ke ntho e ntle.
And it’s individual.	'Me ke motho ka mong.
This may take some time.	Sena se ka nka nako.
He wept and told them everything.	A lla, a ba bolella tsohle.
It was the first time she had seen such a dog.	O ne a qala ho bona ntja e joalo.
However, it will not start.	Leha ho le joalo, e ke ke ea qala.
That looked like the picture.	Seo se ne se shebahala joalo ka setšoantšo.
This was very difficult, and it took a lot of time.	Sena se ne se le boima haholo, 'me se ile sa nka nako e ngata.
I'm singing.	Ke ntse ke bina.
She always does her homework before going to bed.	O lula a etsa mosebetsi oa hae oa sekolo pele a robala.
We hope they will find it soon.	Re tšepa hore haufinyane ba tla e fumana.
He took great care of it.	O ile a e hlokomela ka hloko haholo.
We are afraid that we will not be able to get past them.	Re tšaba hore re ke ke ra khona ho feta ho tsona.
I could not read him.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho mo bala.
It was bad news.	E ne e le litaba tse mpe.
I will let you see how we go.	Ke tla u lumella ho bona hore na re tsamaea joang.
And now here.	Mme jwale mona.
Which, of course, is a real thing.	E leng hore, ha e le hantle, ke ntho ea sebele.
It only took him a week to get here.	Ho mo nkile beke feela ho fihla mona.
Take this, all of you, and eat of it.	Nka sena, kaofela ha lona, ​​mme le je tsa sona.
He is there.	O teng.
This was a great opportunity.	Ona e ne e le monyetla o moholo.
Some of us have seen it, some of us have not seen it.	Ba bang ba rona ba e bone, ba bang ba rona ha ba e bone.
Kind of nice.	Mofuta o motle.
It is very strong, very dangerous.	E matla haholo, e kotsi haholo.
I did not want to be here.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho ba mona.
He did well.	O entse hantle.
It is not a strange feeling.	Ha se maikutlo a makatsang.
Please stay where you are.	Ke kopa o lule moo o leng teng.
He knows there is something.	O a tseba hore ho na le ho hong.
Good news though.	Taba e ntle leha ho le joalo.
Probably would.	Mohlomong e ne e tla tlameha.
While it may not be true before, it is now.	Le hoja e ka ’na eaba ha se ’nete pele, ke hona joale.
He was not at school today.	O ne a le sieo sekolong kajeno.
Watch how they use their feet when playing.	Sheba hore na ba sebelisa maoto a bona hakae ha ba bapala.
I'm sorry he can't come.	Ke masoabi hore ebe ha a khone ho tla.
I know, son.	Ke a tseba, mora.
But we are talking now.	Empa rea ​​bua jwale.
You can do this.	U ka etsa sena.
They both look very happy.	Ka bobeli ba bonahala ba thabile haholo.
It was as painful as when nothing had ever happened.	Ho ne ho le bohloko joalo ka ha ho se letho le kileng la ba le lona.
Eventually it will be so.	Qetellong ho tla ba joalo.
Nobody wants that !.	Ha ho motho ea batlang seo!.
They want to live a better life.	Ba batla ho phela bophelo bo molemo.
He heard, but did not understand.	O ile a utloa, empa ha aa ka a utloisisa.
Just keep going.	Tsoela pele feela.
He made his own at the end of the road.	O ile a etsa ea hae qetellong ea tsela.
It is not enough to live.	Ha hoa lekana ho phela.
That time was not only legal, but legal.	Nako eo e ne e se ea molao feela, empa e ne e le ea molao.
We would have breakfast.	Re ne re tla ja lijo tsa hoseng.
Neither did his father.	Le ntate oa hae ha aa ka a ba joalo.
He needs a team just as we need him.	O hloka sehlopha joalo ka ha re mo hloka.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
I'll go now, right now, and tell them.	Ke tla ya jwale, hona jwale, mme ke ba bolelle.
No one knew.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba.
Has this ever happened before?	Na see se kile sa etsahala pele?
I don’t think there are too many people coming here.	Ha ke nahane hore ho na le batho ba bangata haholo ba tlang mona.
Just then, though.	Feela ka nako eo, leha ho le joalo.
He is also a person who has been.	Hape ke motho ea kileng a ba teng.
He may have been at another time.	E ka 'na eaba o ne a le ka nako e 'ngoe.
It was really nice.	E ne e hlile e le ntle.
It seems to be working now.	Ho bonahala e sebetsa hona joale.
You will need someone to drive you there and back.	U tla hloka motho ea tla u khanna moo le ho khutla.
It still has the same problem.	E ntse e na le bothata bo tšoanang.
Which is not the case at all.	E leng hore ha se taba ena ho hang.
I never told you.	Ha ke eso o bolelle.
Obviously it is necessary.	Ho hlakile hore hoa hlokahala.
I am learning things about myself every day.	Ke ntse ke ithuta lintho ka 'na letsatsi le letsatsi.
Water is important, but not as important as food.	Metsi a bohlokoa, empa ha a bohlokoa joalo ka lijo.
He worked with Dad.	O ne a sebetsa le Ntate.
And they probably wouldn't do that.	Mme mohlomong ba ne ba ke ke ba etsa jwalo.
But they were not talking about that now.	Empa ba ne ba sa bue ka seo jwale.
I just got out.	Ke qetile ho tsoa.
They will by no means have too much for him.	Ho hang ba ke ke ba ba le e ngata haholo ho eena.
I've seen this.	Ke bone sena.
That had to mean something.	Seo se ne se lokela ho bolela ho hong.
I had to keep going.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
That is a real problem.	Ke bothata ba sebele.
Then they will look for him.	Joale ba tla mo batla.
No one was talking.	Ho ne ho se motho ya buang.
You can’t imagine how hard it was.	U ke ke ua nahana hore na e ne e le thata hakae.
I will not look.	Ha ke tlo sheba.
Problems were coming.	Mathata a ne a tla.
I met them.	Ke ile ka kopana le bona.
The expert works hard.	Setsebi se sebetsa ka thata.
I do that very well.	Ke etsa seo hantle haholo.
But surprisingly good.	Empa e makatsang ka tsela e ntle.
These are my favorites.	Tsena ke tseo ke li ratang.
Often, that is fun.	Hangata, hoo ho monate.
Nobody did that.	Haho motho ya entseng seo.
But that would not help.	Empa hoo ho ne ho ke ke ha thusa.
It never worked.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea sebetsa.
It was early in the morning.	E ne e sa le hoseng.
The police finally arrived at the scene.	Qetellong mapolesa a ile a fihla sebakeng seo.
Of course we cannot understand.	Ke ’nete hore re ke ke ra utloisisa.
My favorite type of breakfast.	Mofuta oo ke o ratang oa lijo tsa hoseng.
Be sure to try this if you get the chance.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u leka sena haeba u fumana monyetla.
Maybe he knew.	Mohlomong o ne a tseba.
I used to be that boy.	Ke kile ka ba moshanyana eo.
No one likes to call children.	Ha ho motho ea ratang ho letsetsa bana.
You better go now.	Ho molemo hore u tsamaee hona joale.
Everyone who was there was there.	E mong le e mong eo e neng e le mang kapa mang o ne a le teng.
It was a wonderful day to live in!	E ne e le letsatsi le monate ho phela!
Otherwise he will get nothing.	Ho seng joalo a ke ke a fumana letho.
One cannot work without the other.	E mong a ke ke a sebetsa ntle le e mong.
Our current situation is the same.	Boemo ba rona ba hona joale bo joalo.
Say that just right, stand up.	Bua seo hantle feela, ema.
But they thought they were too busy or too important.	Empa ba ne ba nahana hore ba phathahane kapa ba bohlokoa haholo.
I sat down carefully.	Ke ile ka lula fatše ka hloko.
I have never been.	Ha ke eso be teng.
Just never enough.	Feela ha ho mohla ho lekaneng.
It wasn't hard enough.	E ne e se thata ho lekana.
He sees what you want to see.	O bona seo o batlang ho se bona.
There is no time to wait, he said.	Ha ho nako ea ho ema, o ile a re.
And we should not.	Mme ha rea ​​lokela.
This is what it is.	Sena ke sona seo e leng sona.
The son returned and told his mother everything he had done.	Mora o ile a khutla ’me a bolella ’mè oa hae ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe eo a e entseng.
He says nothing that night.	Ha a bue letho bosiung boo.
That looks more likely than ever.	Seo se shebahala se le monyetla ho feta pele.
Like this?	Rata sena?
If you did not do it, you still should not do it.	Haeba u ne u sa e etsa, u ntse u sa lokela ho etsa joalo.
I could not see this thing.	Ke ne nke ke ka bona ntho ena.
What they were doing was not as good as what they were.	Seo ba neng ba se etsa se ne se se ntle joalo ka seo ba neng ba le sona.
You have to help them.	U tlameha ho ba thusa.
He knew what he was talking about.	O ne a tseba seo a buang ka sona.
That's when they can sleep.	Ke ha ba ka robala.
Its contents are easy to understand.	Litaba tsa eona li bonolo ho utloisisa.
Then you can see exactly what you want to see.	Joale u ka bona hantle seo u batlang ho se bona.
You do the best you can.	U etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang.
And he could see nothing.	Mme o ne a sa bone letho.
The way out of it all.	Tsela ea ho tsoa ho tsohle.
I hope you understand it.	Ke tšepa ho e utloisisa.
Honestly, no one expected this to happen.	Ho bua ’nete, ho ne ho se motho ea neng a lebeletse hore sena se tla etsahala.
But they are not needed.	Empa ha ba hlokahale.
We have no children.	Ha re na bana.
Everyone was nice and helpful.	E mong le e mong o ne a le motle a bile a thusa.
It was an amazing experience.	E ne e le mokhoa o makatsang.
You will not find him.	U ke ke ua mo fumana.
That is our job.	Ke mosebetsi oa rona oo.
But once it stops, don't let it go.	Empa hang ha e e tlohela, e se ke ea e tlohela.
None of them knew him.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a mo tseba.
But still.	Empa leha ho le joalo.
This is relatively simple.	Sena se batla se le bonolo.
I tried it too.	Le nna ke ile ka e leka.
He goes with her.	O tsamaea le eena.
That's the way it is here.	Ke kamoo ho leng kateng mona.
I do not want this.	Ha ke batle sena.
If you know please help.	Haeba u tseba ka kopo thusa.
But this is not the whole point.	Empa sena ha se eona taba eohle.
But it was still very good.	Empa e ne e ntse e le ntle haholo.
He bought.	O ile a reka.
I like to let him.	Ke rata ho mo lumella.
It was very important to stand up.	Ho ne ho le bohlokoa haholo ho ema.
But he did it better.	Empa o ile a e etsa betere.
It's usually not very good.	Hangata ha e ntle haholo.
By writing if you want.	Ka ho ngola haeba u batla.
There is no one like him.	Ha ho motho ea tšoanang le eena.
To tell them everything.	Ho ba bolella tsohle.
She spent a lot of money buying books.	O ile a qeta chelete e ngata a reka libuka.
It should not be so hard.	Ha ea lokela ho ba thata hakaalo.
Then do it again.	Ebe u e etsa hape.
We were even in the same class at school.	Re bile re le sehlopheng se le seng sekolong.
I often cry.	Hangata kea lla.
But you do not tell anyone where you are.	Empa ha o bolelle motho moo o leng teng.
This was very fun.	Sena se ne se le monate haholo.
I'm sure there must be a few.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore e tlameha ebe ho na le ba 'maloa.
It took him a long time to find out.	Ho ile ha mo nka nako e telele hore a tsebe.
And it works very well.	'Me e sebetsa hantle haholo.
You will not find such a perfect fit anywhere.	U ke ke ua fumana ho lekana hantle joalo kae kapa kae.
That's not fun.	Seo ha se monate.
Not a good thing.	Ha se ntho e ntle.
We hope you enjoy these.	Re tšepa hore u tla thabela tsena.
We are happy for our stay.	Re thabetse ho lula ha rona.
Too long for the place.	E telele haholo bakeng sa sebaka seo.
That's what he does now.	Ke seo a se etsang jwale.
No, not at all.	Che, ho hang ha ho joalo.
It's hard, but in the end it's better.	Ho thata, empa qetellong ho molemo.
It is actually easy to take.	Ha e le hantle ho bonolo ho e nka.
Everything else comes to me in a strange way.	Lintho tse ling kaofela li tla ho 'na ka mokhoa o makatsang.
No one will ever get that opportunity again.	Haho motho ya tlang ho fumana monyetla o jwalo hape.
I don't even think he likes it.	Ha ke nahane le hore oa o rata.
Every family needs that.	Lelapa le leng le le leng le hloka seo.
For me, this is a great opportunity.	Ho 'na, ona ke monyetla o motle.
That, you have to be able to understand.	Seo, o lokela ho khona ho utloisisa.
This is my favorite restaurant.	Ena ke ntlo ea lijo eo ke e ratang haholo.
It was.	E ne e bile.
No one can.	Haho motho ka.
That would have been a problem.	E ka be e bile bothata.
But he needs you.	Empa oa u hloka.
The car stopped.	Koloi ea ema.
And crying.	Le ho lla.
He couldn't stay here.	O ne a ke ke a dula ka mona.
I need to get back to it.	Ke hloka ho khutlela ho eona.
I said they were very hurt.	Ke itse ba utloile bohloko haholo.
He was very strong.	O ne a le matla haholo.
Yet they came.	Leha ho le joalo ba ile ba tla.
He existed before.	O bile teng pele.
Little did he know that this was happening.	O ne a sa tsebe hore sena se ntse se etsahala.
That request comes first.	Kopo eo e tla pele ho e ’ngoe.
But it gets there.	Empa e ya fihla moo.
We actually do the same thing.	Ha e le hantle re etsa ntho e tšoanang.
It can happen often, just once, or never.	E ka etsahala hangata, hang feela, kapa ha ho mohla.
He is not so strong.	Ha a matla hakaalo.
He will no longer give.	Ha a sa na ho fana.
That did it.	Seo se e entse.
We have .	Re na le .
However, if necessary they will stay.	Leha ho le joalo, haeba ho hlokahala ba tla lula ho.
Money was hard to come by.	Chelete e ne e le thata ho e fumana.
I like this group.	Ke rata sehlopha sena.
In fact, they were just children.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le bana feela.
We will see how he feels and what he is trying to do.	Re tla bona hore na o ikutloa joang le hore na o ne a leka ho etsa’ng.
No one mentioned them.	Ha ho motho ea buileng ka tsona.
We do not eat dinner.	Ha re je lijo tsa mantsiboea.
No one asked us to do it.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a re kopa ho e etsa.
People visited there.	Batho ba ile ba etela moo.
It's just a question of when.	Ke potso feela ea hore na neng.
Good stuff.	Lintho tse ntle.
I don't care where you are as long as you get home.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na esale u le hokae ha feela u fihla hae.
She started to cry now.	A qala ho lla jwale.
Thank you for this.	Kea leboha ka lebaka la sena.
And in the end, it's fun to use.	'Me qetellong, ho monate ho sebelisa.
I already knew that.	Ke ne ke se ke ntse ke tseba seo.
Watch what happens there carefully.	Sheba se etsahalang moo ka hloko.
He did not eat or drink anything.	O ne a sa je leha e le ho noa letho.
We all have to learn to work as a team.	Kaofela re tlameha ho ithuta ho sebetsa re le sehlopha.
Not many people that day.	Ha se batho ba bangata ka letsatsi leo.
But the doctor understood.	Empa ngaka e ile ea utloisisa.
And when they do someone writes.	Mme ha ba etsa motho e mong o ngola.
We had found it.	Re ne re e fumane.
That it was a way of life.	Hore e ne e le tsela ea bophelo.
You go see, see, all right.	O ya bona, bona, hantle.
I was thinking now.	Ke ne ke nahana joale.
I will find fault.	Ke tla fumana phoso.
Our house is very nice.	Ntlo ea rona e ntle haholo.
Not before.	Che pele.
None of them could.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a ka khona.
He says he is busy.	O re o phathahane.
The person we are going to see, for sure.	Eena motho eo re tlang ho mo bona, ka 'nete.
I think some of them are still going on.	Ke nahana hore tse ling tsa tsona li ntse li tsoela pele.
The first is not necessarily the best.	Pele ha se hakaalo hore e molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Be what you are.	Eba seo o leng sona.
I mean people.	Ke bolela batho.
It is a daily problem with him.	Ke bothata ba letsatsi le letsatsi le eena.
Singing is something he loves very much.	Ho bina ke ntho eo a e ratang haholo.
Some go to get food.	Ba bang ba ea fumana lijo.
they asked.	ba botsa.
Presence is pre-existent.	Ho ba teng ke pele ho ho ba teng.
You have to drive it.	O lokela ho e khanna.
They are all healthy.	Bohle ba phela hantle.
We left.	Re ile ra tsamaea.
You must be close to 30 years old.	O tlameha ho ba o le haufi le ho feta mashome a mararo.
Is this it.	Na ke eona ena.
It does not exist.	Ha e eo.
I'm thinking of you a lot.	Ke ntse ke nahana ka uena haholo.
She is doing well now.	O ntse a sebetsa hantle jwale.
Every player goes through it.	Sebapali se seng le se seng se feta ho eona.
He has nothing there.	Ha a na letho moo.
It really offers a great place.	Ha e le hantle o fana ka sebaka se setle.
I don't think about it.	Ha ke nahane ka eona.
Just be human.	Feela re be batho.
In and out, one.	Ho kena le ho tsoa, ​​e le 'ngoe.
He will never return.	Ha a sa tla khutla.
He really wants to see you again.	O batla haholo ho o bona hape.
Note this is happening please.	Hlokomela sena se etsahala ka kopo.
He has too many books.	O na le libuka tse ngata haholo.
He finally understood.	Qetellong o ile a utloisisa.
They are there for me.	Ba teng bakeng sa ka.
And that's exactly what they did.	Mme ke seo ba se entseng hantle.
He is not a boy anymore, but he has never been a man.	Ha e sa le moshanyana, empa ha e eso ho be monna.
They arrived home exhausted.	Ba ile ba fihla hae ba khathetse.
His job requires him to travel a lot.	Mosebetsi oa hae o hloka hore a tsamaee haholo.
Nothing, never.	Ha ho letho, le ka mohla.
Passing after this time is my job.	Ho feta ka morao ho nako ena ke mosebetsi oa ka.
But just think of that.	Empa nahana feela ka seo.
I was emotional.	Ke ne ke na le maikutlo.
I do not belong to man.	Ha ke oa motho.
I like this group.	Ke rata sehlopha sena.
He has a job.	O na le mosebetsi.
Of course, most people already know that.	Ke ’nete hore batho ba bangata ba se ba ntse ba tseba seo.
I really wanted to try it out.	Ke ne ke hlile ke batla ho e leka.
Nobody says that.	Haho motho ya buang jwalo.
This will help us to know what they know.	Sena se tla re thusa ho tseba seo ba se tsebang.
I like breakfast.	Ke rata lijo tsa hoseng.
As they were.	Joalo ka ha ba ne ba le joalo.
The expert believes it is a matter of time.	Setsebi se lumela hore ke taba ea nako.
You will get here anytime now.	O tla fihla mona nako efe kapa efe hona joale.
We can do something.	Re ka etsa ho hong.
Yet no one came.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho motho ea ileng a tla.
I found my problem and fixed it.	Ke fumane bothata ba ka mme ka bo lokisa.
For others, it may take hours.	Ho ba bang, ho nka lihora tse ngata.
We went out all the time.	Re ne re tsoa ka linako tsohle.
Otherwise, it is not.	Ho seng joalo, ha ho joalo.
He did not know what he was saying.	O ne a sa tsebe seo a se buileng.
That is what our children do.	Ke sona seo bana ba rona ba se etsang.
Do not forget that you love her.	U se ke ua lebala hore ua mo rata.
There seemed to be nothing he could do.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang.
It’s really better for you than working out after dinner.	E hlile e molemo ho uena ho feta ho sebetsa ka mor'a lijo tsa mantsiboea.
Well, try.	Be, leka.
I'll go the other way.	Ke tla ea ka tsela e 'ngoe.
But it was fun.	Empa ho bile monate.
They like to have it both.	Ba rata ho ba le eona ka bobeli.
Read on, thank you.	Bala hantle, kea leboha.
But she seemed happy.	Empa o ne a bonahala a thabile.
I did not play it until last week.	Ha ke so ka ka e bapala ho fihlela bekeng e fetileng.
She looks at him again.	O a mo sheba hape.
I will not help you either.	Le nna ha ke tlo o thusa.
Just that didn't matter.	Feela hoo ho ne ho se na taba.
It seemed important to start there.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le bohlokoa ho qala moo.
This is exactly what we would expect.	Sena ke kamoo re neng re ka lebella kateng.
I'm really big.	Ke moholo ruri.
It has become necessary for me.	Ho se ho hlokahala ho nna.
That's what he thinks.	Ke seo a se nahanang.
It's a very bad thing.	Ke ntho e mpe haholo.
We did not need to think about it.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale hore re nahane ka hona.
But they did not.	Empa ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
Then it was my turn.	Joale e ne e le nako ea ka.
And then the food.	'Me joale lijo.
Some are long but you still get them to take advantage.	Tse ling li telele empa u ntse u li fumana hore li nke monyetla.
But you are definitely not here.	Empa ha e le hantle ha u eo mona.
They knew what to do.	Ba ne ba tseba seo ba lokelang ho se etsa.
Maybe you believe in your own strength.	Mohlomong u lumela matla a hao.
One has to say something.	Motho o tlameha ho bua ho hong.
Tomorrow we would pay him.	Hosane re ne re tla mo lefa.
Please go this way.	Ke kopa u tsamaee ka tsela ena.
I have a strange problem.	Ke na le bothata bo makatsang.
I just gave him the news.	Ke sa tsoa mo fa litaba.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea hore re etse ho hong.
No woman, no children.	Ha ho mosali, ha ho bana.
I never thought he would leave.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore o tla tsamaea.
Everything helps us to do what we do.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e re thusa ho etsa seo re se etsang.
People love to learn about the past.	Batho ba rata ho ithuta lintho tsa khale.
He got up and sat down.	A ema mme a dula.
We played him.	Re ile ra mo bapala.
Do not look for one.	U se ke ua batla motho a le mong.
And what they think we are.	Le seo ba nahanang hore re sona.
It takes hours to work.	Ho nka lihora ho sebetsa.
The time is now.	Nako ke jwale.
Lots of questions.	Lipotso tse ngata.
That is the only way to find out if you are worth it.	Ke eona feela tsela ea ho fumana hore na o bohlokoa bakeng sa chelete.
And now, it happens at home.	Mme jwale, ho etsahala hae.
But that did not matter.	Empa hoo e ne e se taba.
Maybe they are.	Mohlomong ba joalo.
His children did, too.	Bana ba hae ba entse jwalo, le bona.
It was just right	E ne e lekana hantle
I have a few.	Ke na le tse 'maloa.
Only human life.	Bophelo ba motho ke bona feela.
If they can do that, they can do anything.	Haeba ba ka etsa joalo, ba ka etsa eng kapa eng.
They do not.	Ha ba etse joalo.
It's that simple.	Ho bonolo joalo.
I know they did not.	Kea tseba hore ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
Yet they are clear enough.	Leha ho le joalo li hlakile ka ho lekaneng.
He went to help them.	O ile a ea ba thusa.
However, he said.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a re.
My head hasn't been well since then.	Hlooho ya ka ha e eso be hantle ho tloha ka nako eo.
That is our only benefit.	Ke ona feela molemo oa rona.
She doesn't want a man who just does his job.	Ha a batle monna ea etsang mosebetsi oa hae feela.
I could believe it.	Ke ne ke khona ho e lumela.
I ask for help and thank you.	Ke kopa thuso mme kea leboha.
That no one would hear or be with him.	Hore ho se be motho ea tla utloa kapa a be le eena.
They both decide to go out at night.	Bobeli ba etsa qeto ea ho tsoa bosiu.
Sure, you will too, but that will not help.	Ehlile, le uena u tla etsa joalo, empa hoo ho ke ke ha thusa.
But everything is there.	Empa tsohle li teng.
It was not his first time riding a bicycle.	E ne e se lekhetlo la hae la pele a palama baesekele.
At the end of the day.	Qetellong ya letsatsi.
Some of them were good and some were not.	Tse ling tsa tsona li ne li le ntle 'me tse ling li ne li se joalo.
I enjoy that.	Ke thabela seo.
Then he went to sleep.	Eaba o ea robala.
Where does the money come from?	Chelete eo e tsoa kae?.
We will talk about both.	Re tla bua ka bobeli.
She will be a great mother.	E tla ba mme e moholo.
But he did not tell us what happened.    	Empa ha a ka a re bolella se etsahetseng.    
He should not have believed.	O ne a sa lokela ho lumela.
I know they are coming for me.	Kea tseba hore ba ntse ba tla bakeng sa ka.
In fact, he does.	Ha e le hantle, oa etsa joalo.
She was so beautiful.	O ne a le motle haholo.
But it is not just a matter of sleeping.	Empa ha se feela taba ea ho robala.
This is what is most important to us.	Sena ke sona seo e leng sa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa ho rōna.
Kind of weird.	Mofuta o makatsang.
It takes time to learn something.	Ho nka nako ho ithuta ntho e itseng hantle.
Each of us had our own room.	E mong le e mong oa rōna o ne a e-na le kamore ea hae.
You probably see more than anyone else.	Mohlomong o bona ho feta mang kapa mang.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
Dinner maybe.	Ho ja lijo tsa mantsiboea mohlomong.
We need to get away from them.	Re hloka ho tloha ho bona.
I don't know, of course.	Ha ke tsebe, ha e le hantle.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Ha se lekhetlo la pele e etsahala.
When he spoke, he did not mention him.	Ha a bua, ha aa ka a bua ka eena.
It could be even worse!	E ka ba mpe le ho feta!
It was painful, but necessary.	Ho ne ho le bohloko, empa ho hlokahala.
You get it and there is nothing wrong.	O a e fumana mme ha ho phoso.
They needed to talk.	Ba ne ba hloka ho bua.
Several times a day.	Ka makhetlo a 'maloa ka letsatsi.
You probably already have that.	Mohlomong u se u fumane seo.
You have to give people a chance.	O lokela ho fa batho monyetla.
They had a group.	Ba ne ba e-na le sehlopha.
He spoke to her once over the phone.	O ile a bua le eena hang ka mohala.
I did not see anything important or do anything bad.	Ke ne ke sa bone letho la bohlokoa kapa ke etsa ntho leha e le efe e mpe.
For something new and new.	Bakeng sa ntho e ncha le e ncha.
Would you like something to drink?	A na u ka thabela ho noa letho?
I knew how to do it.	Ke ne ke tseba ho etsa joalo.
If anyone can do this.	Haeba motho a ka etsa sena.
He knew he would never win.	O ne a tseba hore a ke ke a hlola.
But it seems possible.	Empa ho bonahala ho ka etsahala.
He cares for their children.	O hlokomela bana ba bona.
It was as if he wanted nothing from her.	E ne eka ha a batle letho ho eena.
However, it is not the only one.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se eona feela.
In fact, he did not have it.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a se na eona.
He could not believe that his family was really talking about it.	O ne a sa lumele hore lelapa la hae le hlile le bua ka taba ena.
I love it, to be honest.	Kea e rata, ho bua 'nete.
We will not allow this type of.	Re ke ke ra lumella mofuta ona oa .
We did not know.	Re ne re sa tsebe.
He knows many things.	O tseba lintho tse ngata.
Power per day.	Matla ka matsatsi.
Then it was my turn.	Joale e ne e le nako ea ka.
One woman was just crying.	Mosali e mong o ne a lla feela.
But the child does not speak.	Empa ngoana ha a bue.
He did not want to test his mental ability.	O ne a sa batle ho leka matla a hae a kelello.
He is not here.	Ha a eo mona.
If it wasn't from here, it wasn't for nothing.	Haeba e ne e se wa mona, e ne e se wa letho.
I need one.	Ke hloka e 'ngoe.
To name just a few.	Ha re bolela tse 'maloa feela.
Take it every day when it arrives.	Nka letsatsi ka leng ha le fihla.
And we are still waiting.	Mme re ntse re emetse.
Who knows why.	Ke mang ea tsebang lebaka.
We would certainly be happy to help.	Ruri re ka thabela ho thusa.
But there is.	Empa ho teng.
I had to work at night.	Ke ne ke lokela ho sebetsa bosiu.
One was very good.	E 'ngoe e ne e le ntle haholo.
He knows the area well.	O tseba sebaka seo hantle.
Now there is none.	Joale ha ho na.
Only, nothing happens.	Feela, ha ho letho le etsahalang.
Then back to work.	Joale khutlela mosebetsing.
Then they looked down.	Eaba ba sheba fatše.
Everything seemed to work.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e bonahala e sebetsa.
He looked dangerous.	O ne a shebahala a le kotsi.
I can't do it alone.	Ha ke khone ho e etsa ke le mong.
He does not need to know what will happen to him.	Ha aa lokela ho tseba hore na ho tla etsahala eng ka eena.
That place and date.	Sebaka seo le letsatsi leo.
We asked him to sit down and eat with us.	Re ile ra mo kōpa hore a lule fatše ’me a je le rōna.
Because mine did the same thing.	Hobane oa ka o entse ntho e tšoanang.
But you will definitely learn something.	Empa ka sebele u tla ithuta ho hong.
But they do not want to get out.	Empa ha ba batle ho tsoa.
Granted, spending too much time can be harmful.	Ke 'nete hore ho qeta nako e ngata ho ka ba kotsi.
Some of them lived a normal life.	Ba bang ba bona ba ne ba phela ka mokhoa.
However, there was a mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le phoso.
It was him.	E ne e le eena.
It is not necessarily easy to love them.	Hase hakaalo hore ho bonolo ho li rata.
It was difficult but necessary.	Ho ne ho le thata empa ho ne ho hlokahala.
And my father didn't know.	Mme ntate ha a ka a tseba.
It is something we do or do.	Ke ntho eo re e etsang kapa re e etsang.
I will tell the truth to you.	Ke tla bua 'nete ho uena.
I used to talk about these things.	Ke tloaetse ho bua ka lintho tsena.
He looked soft but not so.	O ne a shebahala a le bonolo empa ho se joalo.
I no longer believe that.	Ha ke sa lumela seo.
We are here to find the truth.	Re mona ho batla 'nete.
It didn't matter to me.	Ho ne ho se taba ho nna.
Other than that, however, it is not difficult to do it.	Ntle le moo, leha ho le joalo, ha ho thata ho e etsa.
There was no one else in the area at the time.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong sebakeng seo ka nako eo.
He was present at every one of them.	O ne a le teng ho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
Now here I am.	Joale ke 'na ho qala.
Thank you but no.	Kea leboha empa che.
He can't even ask them.	Ha e khone le ho ba botsa.
You are doing an important job.	U etsa mosebetsi oa bohlokoa.
This creates a beautiful image.	Sena se etsa hore ho be le setšoantšo se setle.
Her husband is away.	Monna oa hae ha a eo.
So he refused to play.	Kahoo o ne a hana ho bapala.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka sena.
They catch everyone.	Ba tšoara bohle.
I was reading the book as soon as it came out.	Ke ne ke bala buka eo hang ha e tsoa.
He had heard it all before.	O ne a utloile tsohle pele.
He will be great.	O tla ba moholo.
It can be very difficult.	E ka ba thata haholo.
It hurts to watch.	Ho bohloko ho shebella.
She asked her son for money.	O ile a kopa mora oa hae chelete.
He would never see her again.	Le ka mohla, o ne a ke ke a hlola a mo bona hape.
They are powerful things.	Ke lintho tse matla.
I spent a lot of time talking to him last night.	Ke qetile nako e ngata ke bua le eena bosiung bo fetileng.
He did not stay longer than anyone.	Ha aa ka a lula ho feta mang kapa mang.
And there was another man.	Mme ho ne ho le monna e mong.
He was looking at his age.	O ne a sheba lilemo tsa hae.
It made him believe he could do anything.	A etsa hore a lumele hore a ka etsa eng kapa eng.
It is better to spend it here and now.	Ho molemo ho e qeta mona le hona joale.
I have to do more than these.	Ke lokela ho etsa ho feta ho tsena.
It would eat well tonight.	E ne e tla ja hantle bosiung bona.
He had decided to preach.	O ne a entse qeto ea ho bolela.
First of all, it doesn't seem to be a problem at all.	Taba ea pele, ho bonahala e se bothata ho hang.
And it continues to work well.	'Me e tsoela pele ho sebetsa hantle.
He would not like it.	O ne a ke ke a rata.
You can continue, if you wish.	U ka tsoela pele, ha u lakatsa.
I did not want to.	Ke ne ke sa batle.
My first husband died.	Monna oa ka oa pele o ile a hlokahala.
It was hard though.	Ho ne ho le thata leha ho le joalo.
If you want to go, you will do the same.	Haeba u batla ho tsamaea, u tla etsa joalo le uena.
In my workplace.	Sebakeng sa ka sa mosebetsi.
It hurts so much for them.	Ho bohloko haholo bakeng sa bona.
They may want something from me first.	Ba ka batla ho hong ho nna pele.
It was a hard fall.	E ne e le ho oa ho thata.
things are fine there.	lintho li hantle moo.
It should not be hard to find it.	Ha ea lokela ho ba thata ho e fumana.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
Her father gives her the money, and she leaves.	Ntate oa hae o mo fa chelete, 'me oa tsamaea.
I forget this.	Ke lebala sena.
It certainly did.	Ehlile e entse joalo.
She watched him go.	O ile a mo shebella ha a tsamaea.
I hear you well.	Ke u utloa hantle.
Drink water for one day.	Noa metsi ka letsatsi le le leng.
Don't you like it?	Na ha u li rate?
This way, don’t think too much.	Ka tsela ena, u se ke ua nahana ho feta.
It was good.	Ho bile hantle.
I mean, he was good enough.	Ke bolela, o ne a le motle ho lekana.
However, it is not so simple.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
However, they resigned.	Leha ho le joalo, ba tlohela mosebetsi.
Because it was clearly not the same person.	Ke hobane ho hlakile hore e ne e se motho a le mong.
It really did exist.	Ehlile e bile teng.
He had once died.	O ne a kile a hlokahala.
Continue as long as you can.	Tsoela pele ka nako e telele kamoo u ka khonang.
I have always been busy.	esale ke phathahane.
Everyone stays out of school from time to time.	E mong le e mong o lula a le sieo sekolong nako le nako.
He never saw it.	Ha a so ka a e bona.
Any good thing takes time.	Ntho efe kapa efe e ntle e nka nako.
It can happen anywhere.	E ka etsahala kae kapa kae.
I'm not so sure.	Ha ke na bonnete hakaalo.
He is great.	O moholo.
Legally this is true.	Ka molao sena ke 'nete.
Here it is now.	Ke ena joale.
It's beautiful.	E ntle.
Would it hurt to just pick up the phone and call her ?.	Ho ka ba bohloko ho nka mohala feela ebe o mo letsetsa?.
However, they do exist.	Leha ho le joalo, li teng.
However, the work was still there.	Leha ho le joalo, mosebetsi o ne o ntse o le teng.
School kids, you know.	Bana ba sekolong, o ya tseba.
It does not even have to cost you money.	Ha ho hlokahale le hore e u je chelete.
I want them to be present at this time.	Ke batla hore ba be teng nakong ena.
This is still very simple.	Sena se ntse se le bonolo haholo.
He can do it with people, too.	A ka e etsa le batho, hape.
He knew.	O ne a tseba.
It has the potential to survive.	E na le monyetla oa ho phela.
It's just as sweet.	E monate joalo feela.
It does not seem so.	Ho bonahala ho se joalo.
But only a few people know.	Empa ke batho ba ’maloa feela ba tsebang.
I know family.	Ke tseba lelapa.
I mean, you can stay with me.	Ke bolela, o ka lula le nna.
I would think about it tomorrow.	Ke ne ke tla nahana ka eona hosane.
I know he wouldn't do that.	Kea tseba hore o ne a ke ke a etsa joalo.
She needed to put on some clothes.	O ne a hloka ho apara liaparo tse ling.
It was and still is.	E ne e le teng mme e ntse e le teng ka nako eo.
But that is just outside.	Empa seo se ka ntle feela.
I really did not like it that way.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa e rate ka tsela eo.
I try it again.	Ke e leka hape.
It's fun.	Ho monate.
Make it easier.	Etsa hore e be bonolo haholoanyane.
It was too wet to be good anyway.	E ne e le metsi haholo hore e ka ba molemo leha ho le joalo.
It's close here.	E haufi mona.
You need to help people.	U hloka ho thusa batho.
You do whatever you want.	U etsa eng kapa eng eo u e hlokang.
I like talking to people.	Ke rata ho bua le batho.
I know exactly what we are.	Ke tseba hantle seo re leng sona.
So she started to cry.	Kahoo a qala ho lla.
However, when they do, they are very dangerous.	Leha ho le joalo, ha li etsahala, li kotsi haholo.
Get on it.	Fumana ho eona.
I'll try it tomorrow.	Ke tla leka hosane.
He enjoyed the news.	O ile a thabela litaba tseo.
You will need to stay together.	U tla hloka ho lula hammoho.
Since then he has not asked any questions.	Ho tloha ka nako eo ha aa ka a botsa lipotso.
However, I would do it again.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke tla e etsa hape.
I have seen it many times.	Ke e bone hangata.
Otherwise it would continue.	Ho seng joalo e ne e tla tsoela pele.
Otherwise, go ahead.	Ntle ho moo, tsoela pele.
It was at school.	E ne e le sekolong.
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
There are people who want to talk to him.	Ho na le batho ba batlang ho bua le eena.
He wanted to live without me.	O ne a batla ho phela ntle le 'na.
I don't care.	ha ke na taba.
This is amazingly good.	Sena se setle ka tsela e makatsang.
It is difficult to know what you believe.	Ho thata ho tseba hore na u lumele eng.
Party time!	Nako ea mokete!
And what they did.	Le seo ba se entseng.
It was not what it was.	E ne e se seo e neng e le ka sona.
Get away from me!	Tloha ho 'na!
It was not important.	E ne e se ea bohlokoa.
I don't think I can do that.	Ha ke bone eka nka etsa joalo.
Surprisingly, this is not always the case.	Ho makatsang ke hore ha ho joalo kamehla.
He doesn't want that.	Ha A batle seo.
They wondered how long it could last.	Ba ne ba nahana hore e ka tsoela pele ka nako e kae.
I had never seen that before.	Ke ne ke eso bone seo pele.
It's a very good idea.	Ke mohopolo o monate haholo.
I used my head.	Ke ile ka sebelisa hlooho ea ka.
This is a difficult book.	Ena ke buka e thata.
They work well.	Li sebetsa hantle.
They always think there is something better.	Ba lula ba nahana hore ho na le ho hong ho molemo.
No, it is not just a matter of them.	Che, ha se taba ea bona feela.
They did that very well.	Ba entse seo hantle haholo.
The children were very happy to see their mother.	Bana ba ne ba thabile haholo ha ba bona ’mè oa bona.
It will always be so.	Ho tla ba jwalo kamehla.
I just looked at it.	Ke ile ka e sheba feela.
And then you can look at it.	Mme ebe o ka e sheba.
Just hope they will catch up.	Feela tšepa ba tla tšoara.
But he has never made such a suggestion.	Empa ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa tlhahiso e joalo.
It is nowhere near the power of antiquity.	Ha ho moo haufi le matla a lintho tsa khale.
I mean, always.	Ke bolela, kamehla.
But he did not forget.	Empa ha aa ka a lebala.
That would be a thought.	Eo e ka bang mohopolo.
The worst that can happen is that they refuse.	Ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa e ka etsahalang ke hore ba hana.
Expectation.	Ho lebella.
Then he went.	Ebe o ile.
Of course they are.	Ehlile ba joalo.
You have to go looking for them.	U tlameha ho ea li batla.
But this is not the case.	Empa sena ha se joalo.
You will thank your parents one day.	U tla leboha batsoali ba hao ka letsatsi le leng.
My mother also knew that one day this would happen.	’Mè le eena o ne a tseba hore ka letsatsi le leng sena se tla etsahala.
No one lived to see the sun.	Ha ho le ea mong ea ileng a phela ho fihlela a bona letsatsi.
I left before something bad happened.	Ke ile ka tloha pele ntho e mpe e etsahala.
He looked at my father.	A sheba ntate.
I will apply for a job.	Ke tla etsa kopo ya mosebetsi.
He wanted people.	O ne a batla batho.
This is not an old, simple pain.	Sena ha se bohloko ba khale, bo bonolo.
Just give what you can.	Fana feela seo u ka se khonang.
We did not find anything you are looking for.	Ha rea ​​fumana letho ha u batla.
However, it is better to do so.	Leha ho le joalo, ho molemo hore u etse joalo.
If only it could start.	Hoja feela e ka qala.
He already knows that.	O se a ntse a tseba seo.
You are here.	O ka mona.
He was no longer human.	E ne e se e se motho.
But he is no longer visible.	Empa ha a sa bonahala.
He was talking to someone.	O ne a bua le motho.
It was painful, whatever it was.	Ho ne ho le bohloko, leha e ka ba eng.
We are there for dinner.	Re teng bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
Nobody does things with it.	Ha ho motho ea etsang lintho ka eona.
That is the sad truth of it.	Eo ke ’nete e bohloko ea eona.
He was very good at it.	O ne a le motle haholo ka eona.
You will have to learn more.	O tla tlameha ho ithuta ho feta.
And you can have it.	'Me u ka ba le eona.
And it was really fun.	Mme ho ne ho le monate haholo.
They tried very hard.	Ba ile ba leka ka matla haholo.
Water will not work.	Metsi a ke ke a sebetsa.
You haven't looked a bit.	Ha ua sheba hanyane.
And you will be more.	'Me u tla ba ho feta.
When some leave, others come.	Ha ba bang ba tloha, ba bang ba tla.
These shoes are the best.	Lieta tsena ke tsona tse ntle ka ho fetisisa.
Last night I didn't care.	Bosiung bo fetileng ke ne ke se ke sa tsotelle letho.
That's the hard way to do it.	Ke eona tsela e thata ea ho etsa joalo.
If you want to know.	Ha o batla ho tseba.
We should not talk.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho bua.
Read carefully.	Bala hantle.
And they did not speak as much as before.	Hape ha baa ka ba bua haholo joaloka pele.
He has a good job.	O na le mosebetsi o motle.
I'm back.	Kea khutla.
I know my job.	Ke tseba mosebetsi oa ka.
I read the letter again.	Ke ile ka bala lengolo hape.
However, children are not the only ones.	Leha ho le joalo, bana ha se bona feela.
It was the last of its kind.	E ne e le ea ho qetela ea mofuta oa eona.
It's not a ride.	Ha se ho palama.
There was no such thing.	Ho ne ho se letho le joalo.
We will do this next week.	Re tla etsa sena bekeng e tlang.
I have to get out of here now.	Ke tlameha ho tsoa mona hona joale.
I hope you find what you are looking for.	Ke tšepa hore u tla fumana seo u se ratang.
I have no intention of allowing it.	Ha ke na mohopolo oa ho e lumella.
That we had met.	Hore re ne re kopane.
An adult can go back in time, too.	Motho e moholo a ka khutlela morao nakong, le eena.
That was for other people.	Tseo e ne e le tsa batho ba bang.
I will stay here again.	Ke tla lula mona hape.
It is the power of my life.	Ke matla a bophelo ba ka.
There was no one who could do anything.	Ho ne ho se motho ya ka etsang letho.
Our technician wanted to get out.	Setsebi sa rona se ne se batla ho tsoa.
You are one of the last.	U e mong oa ho qetela.
We will not do that, but they will think we will do it.	Re ke ke ra etsa joalo, empa ba tla nahana hore re tla etsa joalo.
We did not take any money.	Ha rea ​​ka ra nka chelete.
I didn't care, to look for him.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle, ho mo batla.
It is something we know more than that.	Ke ntho eo re e tsebang ho feta.
Then, at the same time.	Joale, ka nako e tšoanang.
That's what it is.	Ke eona taba eo.
We have that.	Re na le seo.
The children were very happy with her help.	Bana ba ne ba thabetse thuso ea hae haholo.
But he did not stay with her for long.	Empa ha aa ka a ba le eena nako e telele.
It seemed unreal.	E ne e bonahala e se ea sebele.
I spent hours playing with them.	Ke ile ka qeta lihora ke bapala le bona.
But my father was not interested in us.	Empa Ntate o ne a se na taba le rōna.
I too have things to learn.	Le 'na ke na le lintho tseo ke lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
I look at them a lot.	Ke li sheba haholo.
But he began to think about it.	Empa o ile a qala ho nahana ka eona.
That is a good question.	Ke potso e ntle eo.
And it can't be.	Mme e ke ke ya ba jwalo.
They may not understand the situation.	E ka ’na eaba ha ba utloisise boemo.
I loved being a weird person.	Ke ne ke rata ho ba motho ea makatsang.
I certainly did.	Ka sebele ke ile ka etsa joalo.
Make its day.	Etsa letsatsi la eona.
But they are not, and they are not.	Empa ha ho jwalo, mme ha ba jwalo.
We allowed him.	Re ile ra mo lumella.
This helped a lot.	Sena se ile sa thusa haholo.
But let it be so.	Empa ho ke ho be jwalo.
And it was, it was really hard.	'Me ho ne ho le joalo, ho ne ho hlile ho le thata.
Have to.	Tlameha ho.
It was clear.	Ho ne ho hlakile.
I know what he wants.	Ke tseba seo a se batlang.
Anyone can speak or write.	Mang kapa mang a ka bua kapa a ngola.
Clearly he was a man.	Ho hlakile hore e ne e le motho.
And we are not that many.	Mme ha re ba bangata hakaalo.
My wife did not know what she was getting.	Mosali oa ka o ne a sa tsebe hore na o fumana eng.
But it was fun as it went on.	Empa e ne e le monate ha e ntse e tsoela pele.
I doubt it though.	Ke belaela leha ho le joalo.
There is room for them.	Ho na le sebaka bakeng sa bona.
And do not do any of the same.	Hape u se ke ua etsa e 'ngoe e tšoanang le eona.
Who said that the book is useless?	Ke mang ea itseng buka eo ha e na thuso?
I think they will love it.	Ke nahana hore ba tla e rata.
So we do not think or decide those questions.	Kahoo ha re nahane kapa ho etsa qeto ea lipotso tseo.
No one had told him what to do or where to be.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a mo boleletse hore na a etse eng kapa a be kae.
Please do not do this.	Ke kopa o seke oa etsa sena.
You believe in something stronger than trust.	U lumela ho ntho e matla ho feta ho tšepa.
I try to think of something, but, they are tall.	Ke leka ho nahana ka ho hong, empa, ba telele.
Now he was no longer a boy.	Joale e ne e se e se moshanyana.
He was a professional actor.	E ne e le sebapali sa setsebi.
It looks like a mistake.	E shebahala joalo ka phoso.
You are better than me.	O molemo ho mpheta.
I don't see a way out of it.	Ha ke bone tsela ea ho tsoa ho eona.
Many people are afraid of it.	Batho ba bangata baa e tšaba.
We are very happy to have it.	Re thabetse haholo ho ba le eona.
It was a lot, maybe a lot.	E ne e le ngata, mohlomong e ngata haholo.
We can get that back.	Re ka fumana seo morao.
But wait, you say.	Empa ema, u re.
I see nothing wrong with that.	Ha ke bone letho le phoso ka seo.
Probably with her father.	Mohlomong le ntate oa hae.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
Yes, that's me.	E, ke 'na eo.
It's hard to say.	Ho thata ho bua.
I want to thank you all here tonight	Ke batla ho le leboha bohle mona bosiung bona
He knew nothing wrong.	O ne a sa tsebe letho le phoso.
And back before.	Le morao pele.
I knew exactly what he had done.	Ke ne ke tseba hantle seo a se entseng.
Try it !.	Leka!.
One man seemed to be talking to himself.	Monna e mong o ne a bonahala a bua a le mong.
Just what they both needed.	Feela seo ka bobeli ba neng ba se hloka.
They take everyone.	Ba nka e mong le e mong.
This, perhaps, is clear.	Sena, mohlomong, se hlakile.
Well, it's not easy.	Hantle, ha ho bonolo.
If you treat them well, they are good to you.	Haeba u ba tšoara hantle, ba molemo ho uena.
No, it doesn't matter, that was a long time ago.	Che, ha ho na taba, hoo e ne e le khale.
But you heard what he said.	Empa u utloile seo a se buileng.
She is his second wife.	Ke mosali oa hae oa bobeli.
Well, maybe now.	Hantle, mohlomong hona joale.
That's him.	Ke eena.
He never thought of doing so.	Ho ne ho se mohla a kileng a nahana ho etsa joalo.
He will buy it or he will not buy it.	O tla e reka kapa a ke ke a e reka.
It was bedtime.	E ne e le nako ya ho robala.
All children must learn to read and write.	Bana bohle ba tlameha ho ithuta ho bala le ho ngola.
After giving your question, you stand up.	Ka mor'a ho fana ka potso ea hau, ua ema.
They were good children.	E ne e le bana ba molemo.
Too much to call forward.	E ngata haholo bakeng sa ho letsetsa pele.
It is much better for you to come.	Ho molemo haholo ho uena ho tla.
And now.	Mme jwale.
They make sense.	Ba etsa kelello.
I think it really is good for anyone.	Ke nahana hore e hlile e molemo ho mang kapa mang.
However, do not ask how it got there.	Leha ho le joalo, u se ke ua botsa hore na e fihla joang moo.
This approach works for you as an individual.	Mokhoa ona o u tsoela molemo joaloka motho e mong.
You really mean it.	O hlile oa e bolela.
Though it seems more.	Leha e bonahala ho feta.
What to do?	Ho etsa eng?
I'm so bad right now.	Ke mpe haholo hona joale.
This is important to note, once again.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa ho hlokomela, hang hape.
I can be my real person now.	Nka ba motho oa ka oa 'nete hona joale.
They treat you well.	Ba u tšoara hantle.
We will probably never have this opportunity again.	Mohlomong ha re sa tla ba le monyetla ona hape.
But it was better than that.	Empa ho ne ho le betere ho feta moo.
We just finished eating.	Re qeta ho ja.
But someone refused.	Empa motho a hana.
Yes, we too need money.	E, le rona re hloka chelete.
I always felt guilty about that.	Ke ne ke lula ke ikutloa ke le molato ka seo.
do not waste time.	seke oa qeta nako.
That happens perhaps more than most people realize.	Seo se etsahala mohlomong ho feta kamoo batho ba tsebang.
And you already have it.	'Me u se u ntse u e-na le eona.
I started talking.	Ke ile ka qala ho bua.
But know this.	Empa tseba sena.
I will do anything for you if you like.	Ke tla u etsetsa eng kapa eng ha u ka rata.
Maybe then he could just.	Mohlomong joale o ne a ka khona feela.
It means.	Ho bolela.
She has too many books in her bedroom.	O na le libuka tse ngata haholo ka phaposing ea hae ea ho robala.
That took a long time.	Seo se ile sa nka nako e telele.
It's not my place.	Ha se sebaka sa ka.
Of course, it did not work.	Ehlile, ha ea ka ea sebetsa.
It doesn't make sense.	Ha e na kelello.
I needed to see it.	Ke ne ke hloka ho o bona.
I don't know how it works.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e sebetsa joang.
Everyone loves to have friends to study together.	Batho bohle ba rata ho ba le metsoalle ho ithuta hammoho.
This was not easy.	Sena se ne se se bonolo.
To get there.	Ho fihla moo.
You will go through this.	O tla feta ka sena.
We would certainly do something with our lives.	Ka sebele re ne re tla etsa ho hong ka bophelo ba rōna.
He had a good idea about this.	O ne a e-na le maikutlo a monate ka sena.
He just finished school.	O sa tsoa qeta sekolong.
We spent most of that day.	Re ile ra qeta nako e ngata ea letsatsi leo.
Too much thinking and reading.	Ho nahana haholo le ho bala.
But they have not.	Empa ha ba eso ho etse.
Just my thing.	Ntho ea ka feela.
Or, it should be.	Kapa, ​​e lokela ho ba joalo.
We need to be together again.	Re hloka ho ba hammoho hape.
Nothing else matters to him.	Ha ho letho le leng la bohlokoa ho eena.
He loved it here.	O ne a e rata mona.
I just want to thank you.	Ke batla ho le leboha feela.
It's not that they stood nearby and watched it happen.	Ha se hore ba ile ba ema haufi mme ba shebella ha e etsahala.
I'm glad you're here today.	Ke thabile ha o le teng kajeno.
Finally he said.	Qetellong a re.
People are talking about him, but he is not talking about it.	Batho ba bua ka eena, empa ha a sa bua.
However it worked.	Leha ho le joalo e ile ea sebetsa.
They are already in great pain.	Ba se ba utloile bohloko haholo.
Do not say no.	O se ke wa re ha o etse jwalo.
If you make a mistake, then you always have it.	Haeba u etsa phoso, joale u lula u e-na le eona.
And going to bed very early.	Le ho robala hoseng haholo.
But this is the life we ​​were supposed to live, just this.	Empa bona ke bophelo boo re neng re tlameha ho bo phela, bona feela.
We, you and I.	Rona, wena le nna.
He plays hard.	O bapala ka thata.
The first one works well.	Ea pele e sebetsa hantle.
Maybe not a good idea.	Mohlomong ha se mohopolo o motle.
I can feel it now.	Ke khona ho e utloa hona joale.
Last year was nothing.	Selemong se fetileng e ne e se letho.
The older man stayed a little longer.	Monna e moholo a lule hanyane.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
You don't have to do anything.	Ha o a tlameha ho etsa letho.
They came out after us.	Ba ne ba tsoa ka mor’a rōna.
Just recently.	Haufinyane feela.
There was nothing else he could do.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng leo a ka le etsang.
Then it can no longer exist.	Joale e ke ke ea hlola e e-ba teng.
Soon he came to it.	Kapele a tla ho eona.
So it is possible that he knew nothing more.	Kahoo ho ne ho ka etsahala hore ebe o ne a sa tseba letho ho feta moo.
But they need money.	Empa ba hloka chelete.
Or so it seemed.	Kapa ke kamoo ho neng ho bonahala kateng.
You were so beautiful.	U ne u le motle haholo.
She is reading a book.	O bala buka.
This is even worse.	Sena se mpe le ho feta.
People want to look like me.	Batho ba batla ho shebahala joaloka 'na.
I will treat him well when he returns tomorrow.	Ke tla mo tšoara hantle ha a khutla hosane.
Do not buy.	U se ke ua reka.
We would appreciate your help in that.	Re ka thabela thuso ea hau ho seo.
I think the school understood.	Ke nahana hore sekolo se ne se utloisisa.
I want to be able to handle it.	Ke batla ho khona ho e tšoara.
We start with the second level.	Re qala ka boemo ba bobeli.
We are old friends.	Re metsoalle ea khale.
Make sure you talk about him first.	Etsa bonnete ba hore o bua ka eena pele.
Either way, it would be a problem if it were known.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe, e ka ba bothata haeba ho ne ho ka tseba.
They did not need money.	Ba ne ba sa hloke chelete.
This was their place of work.	Ena e ne e le sebaka sa bona sa mosebetsi.
I have one of them.	Ke na le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
He thought he would never see that picture again.	O ne a nahana hore a ke ke a hlola a bona setšoantšo seo hape.
Others were with him.	Ba bang ba ne ba e-na le eena.
So he looked at it.	Kahoo a e sheba.
I am one person.	Ke motho a le mong.
One only has to know how to do it right.	Motho o tlameha feela ho tseba ho e etsa hantle.
My name was the only one with nothing next to it.	Lebitso la ka e ne e le lona feela le se nang letho haufi le lona.
I think this is my point.	Ke nahana hore taba ea ka ke ena.
First, then another.	Ea pele, ebe e 'ngoe.
He was with us, but only a little.	O ne a ena le rona, empa hanyane feela.
There will be more.	Ho tla ba le ho feta.
The man has a car.	Monna o na le koloi.
You can check them out here.	U ka sheba tsona mona.
But this did not happen.	Empa sena ha sea ka sa etsahala.
Or in all three.	Kapa ho tse tharo kaofela.
You can stay the night, if you like.	U ka lula bosiu, ha u rata.
We will go alone.	Re tla tsamaea re le bang.
It was a wonderful feeling.	E ne e le maikutlo a monate.
However, do not think that it is bad.	Leha ho le joalo, u se ke ua nahana hore e mpe.
I cried a lot about it.	Ke ile ka lla haholo ka eona.
If we know, and we can say, you will know.	Ha re tseba, mme re ka re, le tla tseba.
Therefore	Ka hona
Without him, it would have been empty.	Ntle ho eena, e ne e tla be e se na letho.
Some of them are hard to reach.	Tse ling tsa tsona li thata ho fihla ho tsona.
Children of	Bana ba
They do things.	Ba etsa lintho.
I don't have time to do this right now.	Ha ke na nako ea ho etsa sena hona joale.
This is probably what you want.	Sena mohlomong ke seo u se batlang.
And we would spend a week on each one.	'Me re ne re tla qeta beke ho e' ngoe le e 'ngoe.
They come together to help.	Li kopane hammoho ho thusa.
But really.	Empa ha e le hantle.
I don’t know what she saw in a guy like me.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o ne a bona eng ho mohlankana ea kang 'na.
But the place was still painful.	Empa sebaka seo se ne se ntse se le bohloko.
No one knew much about it.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba haholo ka eona.
Easy is very good.	Ho bonolo ho molemo haholo.
I have been there.	Ke bile teng.
And then there was none.	'Me joale ho ne ho se na.
Buy whatever you want.	Reka eng kapa eng eo u e batlang.
Thank you for that.	Ke leboha seo.
But we would not go now.	Empa re ka be re sa tlo tsamaea hona joale.
He thought of many things.	O ile a nahana ka lintho tse ngata.
I got right in.	Ke ile ka kena hantle.
They look and feel great.	Ba shebahala ba bile ba le monate.
It was time for the car to move smoothly.	E ne e le nako ea hore koloi e tsamaee hantle.
Of man and woman.	Ea monna le mosali.
Make yourself available.	Etsa hore u be teng.
It is a child who may have to suffer a lot.	Ke ngoana ea ka ’nang a tlameha ho utloa bohloko haholo.
Who knows what it would have been like.	Ke mang ea tsebang hore na e ka be e bile eng.
However, everything is going well.	Leha ho le joalo, tsohle li tsamaea hantle.
They are afraid that he will tell the people what he knows about them.	Ba tšaba hore o tla bolella batho seo a se tsebang ka bona.
Talk to someone.	Bua le motho.
The work has been going on for a long time now.	Mosebetsi o se o ntse o tsoela pele ka nako e telele joale.
They are going to sleep.	Ba il'o robala.
.	.
I will do anything to help you, whatever.	Ke tla etsa eng kapa eng ho le thusa, eng kapa eng.
We could watch him for hours.	Re ne re khona ho mo shebella ka lihora tse ngata.
It is easy to understand what happened.	Ho bonolo ho utloisisa se etsahetseng.
I'm sorry to hear this.	Ke masoabi ho utloa sena.
That is not so easy.	Hoo ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
I like this.	Ke rata ntho ena.
There she is, the girl he loved.	Ke eo, ngoanana eo a neng a mo rata.
Our days begin at night.	Matsatsi a rona a qala bosiu.
I have no idea what people were thinking or feeling.	Ha ke tsebe hore na batho ba ne ba nahana eng kapa ba ikutloa joang.
I had to have it.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho ba le eona.
The phone rings.	Mohala oa lla.
I never knew anyone by that name.	Ha ke eso tsebe motho ka lebitso leo.
I've seen it now.	Ke e bone hona joale.
I will never be able to.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke khona.
He really wanted to know.	O ne a hlile a batla ho tseba.
I will do it next time.	Ke tla e etsa nakong e tlang.
It’s a weird night though.	Ke bosiu bo makatsang leha ho le joalo.
It is a day we think we can do.	Ke letsatsi leo re nahanang hore re ka le etsa.
It was then that he realized something strange.	Ke nakong eo a ileng a hlokomela ntho e makatsang.
You can talk to him.	U ka bua le eena.
They were very nice, professional, very helpful.	Ba ne ba le motle haholo, ba le setsebi, ba thusa haholo.
It should not be too difficult to find him.	Ha ea lokela ho ba thata haholo ho mo fumana.
I have to talk to you.	Ke tlameha ho bua le wena.
That means you are human.	Seo se bolela hore o motho.
Most are easy to read.	Tse ngata li bonolo ho li bala.
But even this may not be enough.	Empa le sena se ka 'na sa se ke sa lekana.
I was waiting for you.	Ke ne ke o emetse.
She was glad she didn't leave him.	O ne a thabetse hore ebe ha aa ka a tloha ho eena.
Where were we when?	Re ne re le kae neng.
These things are very bad.	Lintho tsena li mpe haholo.
He was a child.	E ne e le ngoana.
Look at the picture.	Sheba setšoantšo sena.
It seems that at this point it is useless.	Ho bonahala eka nakong ena ha e na thuso.
I needed it.	Ke ne ke hloka.
My mind was empty.	Kelello ea ka e ne e se na letho.
Walk on foot.	Tsamaea ka maoto.
Is life worth living?	Na bophelo bo bohlokoa?
We forget to eat.	Re lebala ho ja.
And it's hard to find.	'Me ho thata ho fumana.
I'm happy about it, of course.	Ke thabile ka hona, ehlile.
I just found out.	Ke sa tsoa fumana.
So they knew about it.	Kahoo ba ne ba tseba ka eona.
Yes, indeed.	E, ka 'nete.
Let me be.	Ke be joalo.
I could not fix the matter myself.	Ke ne nke ke ka khona ho lokisa taba eo le 'na.
When he sleeps.	Ha a robala.
It has never happened before or after.	Ha e e-so ka e etsahala pele kapa ka mor'a moo.
He wanted to go back home.	O ne a batla ho khutlela hae.
I thought it was so much fun.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho monate haholo.
He could not talk about his past life.	O ne a ke ke a bua ka bophelo ba hae ba nakong e fetileng.
The room is also nice.	Kamore le eona e ntle.
We could not have said it better.	Re ka be re sa ka ra e bua betere.
It makes him what he is.	E mo etsa seo a leng sona.
You will have to get it from them.	O tla lokela ho e fumana ho bona.
And there are a lot of people who want you to do it.	Mme ho na le batho ba bangata ba batlang hore o e etse.
But stay tonight.	Empa dula bosiung bona.
And this time we are trying to do the same thing.	'Me nakong ena re leka ho etsa ntho e tšoanang.
I want to read its contents.	Ke batla ho bala litaba tsa eona.
He felt so much better.	O ile a ikutloa a le betere haholo.
You will use them often.	U tla li sebelisa hangata.
And that should remain the case.	Mme seo se lokela ho dula jwalo.
It always has nothing.	Ka kamehla ha e na letho.
That's all.	Ho jwalo feela.
They drive a car.	Ba khanna koloi.
I did not understand much.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hakaalo.
The way out.	Tsela ea ho tsoa.
Or you can do it.	Kapa u ka etsa joalo.
We had a great week.	Re bile le beke e ntle haholo.
He needed a second opinion.	O ne a hloka maikutlo a bobeli.
I understand things.	Ke utloisisa lintho.
Instead, I just sat here reading.	Ho e-na le hoo, ke ile ka lula mona ke bala.
It looks like the one he used to wear.	E shebahala joaloka eo a kileng a e apara.
It's me.	Ke 'na.
However, I was so distraught that I could not think clearly.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke utloile bohloko haholo hoo ke neng ke sitoa ho nahana hantle.
Of course, you also have to come tomorrow.	Ehlile, le uena u tlameha ho tla hosane.
They come in.	Ba kena.
Now is our time.	Joale ke nako ea rona.
I hope it hurts.	Ke tšepa hore e bohloko.
It is a difficult thing to achieve.	Ke ntho e thata ho e fihlela.
I did not have.	Ke ne ke se na.
But you do not know.	Empa ha o tsebe.
I would like to help you.	Ke kopa ho u thusa.
One would have thought that they would start there but no.	Motho o ne a ka nahana hore ba tla qala moo empa che.
He did not need to think long.	O ne a sa hloke ho nahana nako e telele.
You have too many.	U na le tse ngata haholo.
You can no longer stand.	Ha u sa khona ho ema.
I know you are stronger than you know.	Kea tseba hore u matla ho feta kamoo u tsebang.
In fact, it was very good.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le ntle haholo.
I can't expect much from you.	Nke ke ka lebella tse ngata ho wena.
But it was probably not more fun than that.	Empa mohlomong e ne e se monate ho feta moo.
I made a mistake, but it is in the past.	Ke entse phoso, empa ke nakong e fetileng.
I don't care about time.	Ha ke tsotelle nako.
All he could think of was from here.	Sohle seo a neng a ka se nahana ke ho tloha mona.
His room, where a lot of things happened.	Kamore ea hae, moo ho etsahetseng lintho tse ngata.
Not sure what you are doing?	Ha u tsebe hantle seo u se etsang?
He did not return home until after two o'clock.	Ha aa ka a khutlela hae hape ho fihlela ka mor'a bobeli.
I refused to give up any of it.	Ke ile ka hana ho tlohela e 'ngoe ea eona.
Maybe this is happening to both of us.	Mohlomong sena se etsahala ho rona ka bobeli.
We have no friends here.	Ha re na metsoalle mona.
I did not know what kind of person I was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke ea mofuta ofe.
Tell us what you know about this situation.	Re bolelle seo u se tsebang ka boemo bona.
You have to get out of here before something bad happens.	U tlameha ho tsoa mona pele ntho e mpe e etsahala.
Did you want him to stay?	Na u ne u batla hore a lule?
So this picture.	Kahoo setšoantšo sena.
It was delicious to eat.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ja.
Now, you know.	Joale, ua tseba.
Some years are better than others.	Lilemo tse ling li molemo ho feta tse ling.
It was not my business.	E ne e se taba ea ka.
She was there for her baby.	O ne a le teng bakeng sa ngoana oa hae.
He was still suffering.	O ne a ntse a tsoela pele ho utloa bohloko.
It really hurts.	Ho bohloko ruri.
It is either or not.	Ke bobeli kapa che.
Some may just pass by.	Ba bang ba ka 'na ba feta feela.
Without money, of course.	Ntle le chelete, ho hlakile.
This was a great opportunity for me.	Ona e ne e le monyetla o moholo ho ’na.
She is a very sweet girl.	Ke ngoanana ea monate haholo.
Maybe you will like it.	Mohlomong o tla e rata.
And they certainly do.	'Me ka sebele ba etsa joalo.
I just don't see that happening.	Ke mpa ke sa bone seo se etsahala.
You will not need them.	U ke ke ua li hloka.
That made it even harder for me not to cry.	Seo se ile sa etsa hore ho be thata le ho feta hore ke se ke ka lla.
Time passed.	Nako e ile ea feta.
To you, to me, to everyone here.	Ho uena, ho 'na, ho bohle mona.
Today was a wonderful day.	Kajeno e ne e le letsatsi le monate.
We have never seen it.	Ha re eso e bone.
Of course, you can use both.	Ha e le hantle, u ka sebelisa bobeli.
Obviously this is not the case.	Ho hlakile hore sena ha se joalo.
And so they see it.	Mme ka hona ba e bona.
It was a beautiful place from there.	E ne e le sebaka se setle ho tloha ho sona.
I have no strength left.	Ha ke sa na matla.
It was you.	U ne u le uena.
I did that last year.	Ke entse seo selemong se fetileng.
This book is really about parents.	Buka ena e hlile e bua le batsoali.
It's bad for you.	E mpe ho uena.
It certainly was not ours.	Ka sebele e ne e se ea rōna.
That was not his way.	Eo e ne e se tsela ya hae.
It did not happen to him.	Ha hoa ka ha etsahala ho eena.
Because we would all be here.	Hobane bohle re ne re tla ba mona.
However, sorry about the news.	Leha ho le joalo, masoabi ka litaba.
I mean, you're just as happy.	Ke bolela hore o thabile jwalo feela.
You want to do it that way, right with me.	O batla ho etsa ka tsela eo, hantle le nna.
I'm tired.	Ke khathetse.
You have seen this many times before.	U se u bone tsena ka makhetlo a 'maloa pele.
All of this took time.	Sena sohle se ile sa nka nako.
We know we want to.	Rea tseba hore re batle.
If he still had it.	Haeba o ne a ntse a e-na le eona.
People say what they want.	Batho ba bolela seo ba se batlang.
The pain made me think of other things.	Bohloko bo ile ba etsa hore ke nahane ka lintho tse ling.
Yes, there really is such a place.	E, ho hlile ho na le sebaka se joalo.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
Not as bad as you think.	Ha e mpe joalo ka ha o nahana.
It didn't work with it.	Ha ea sebetsa le eona.
He will love them.	O tla ba rata.
My children have heard it.	Bana ba ka ba e utloile.
But they knew.	Empa ba ne ba tseba.
And this is his place.	Le sebaka sa hae sena.
These are real people.	Bana ke batho ba sebele.
You can take this from me.	O ka nka ena ho nna.
It should not be here.	Ha ea lokela ho ba mona.
Then he called my parents.	Joale o ne a letsetsa batsoali ba ka.
Yet man has never seen it as true.	Leha ho le joalo motho ha a e-s'o bone e le 'nete.
We were there.	Re ne re le teng.
There is something you want.	Ho na le seo u se batlang.
No one knew how it would continue.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tseba hore na e tla tsoela pele joang.
I could see how he felt about her.	Ke ne ke bone tsela eo a neng a ikutloa ka eona ka eena.
I had a picture, and it was.	Ke ne ke e-na le setšoantšo, 'me ho ne ho le joalo.
So if you like them, you will probably like this one.	Kahoo haeba u li rata, mohlomong u tla rata ena.
I'll finish tomorrow.	Kea qeta hosane.
Thank you so much for any help!	Ke leboha haholo ka thuso efe kapa efe!
And my bedroom.	Le kamore ea ka ea ho robala.
I will tell you the reason for this.	Ke tla le bolella lebaka la sena.
Anyone with an opinion.	Mang kapa mang ea nang le maikutlo.
How can this be.	See se ka etsahala joang.
It is a real force.	Ke matla a sebele.
He had other problems.	O ne a e-na le mathata a mang.
I tell you, no.	Kea u bolella, ha ho joalo.
And I didn’t really understand much of it.	'Me ke ne ke sa utloisise haholo ho eona.
I'm happy though.	Ke thabile leha ho le joalo.
He was even unreasonable.	O ne a bile a sa etse kelello.
But there was nothing there.	Empa ho ne ho se letho moo.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke na bonnete.
There are many.	Ho na le tse ngata.
To the people, they saw nothing.	Ho batho, ba ne ba sa bone letho.
I did not like that.	Ke ne ke sa rate seo.
I want to come here.	Ke batla ho tla mona.
But none of us really knew what we were getting into.	Empa ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a hlile a tseba hore na re kena ho eng.
It was not his style.	E ne e se mokhoa oa hae.
They were just real friends.	E ne e mpa e le metsoalle ea sebele.
You know how beautiful it was before.	Ua tseba hore na e ne e le ntle hakae pele.
We did not retreat.	Ha rea ​​ka ra khutlela morao.
We can't stand it.	Re sitoa ho ema.
Some children refuse to go to school.	Bana ba bang ba hana ho ea sekolong.
I thought we were.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re.
I don't want that anymore.	Ha ke sa batla seo.
Some consider them to be very good while others are very bad.	Ba bang ba li nka e le tse molemo haholo ha tse ling e le tse mpe haholo.
It's very difficult, isn't it?	Ho thata haholo, na ha ho joalo?
He needed that job.	O ne a hloka mosebetsi oo.
I was afraid to go.	Ke ne ke tšaba ho tsamaea.
I'll go with you when we're done.	Ke tla tsamaea le uena ha re qeta.
The children are happy!	Bana ba thabile!
That he is yours.	Hore ke eena ea hau.
It wasn't very fun.	Ho ne ho se monate haholo.
But opening is nothing.	Empa ho bula ho letho.
Of course not.	Ha e le hantle ha ho joalo.
I am of age.	Ke ba lilemo.
We will drive there.	Re tl’o khanna moo.
I had nothing to say.	Ke ne ke sena seo nka se buang.
He had never told anyone why, and no one knew.	O ne a eso bolelle motho lebaka, mme ho ne ho se motho ya tsebang.
But he said nothing.	Empa ha a ka a bua letho.
He did not need children.	O ne a sa hloke bana.
And he thought that was what he wanted.	Mme o ne a nahana hore ke sona seo a neng a se batla.
But it is not too bad.	Empa ha e mpe haholo.
Every house should have one.	Ntlo e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e lokela ho ba le eona.
Almost everyone does.	Hoo e ka bang bohle ba etsa joalo.
The baby was crying.	Ngoana o ne a lla.
I'll have to do something.	Ke tla tlameha ho etsa ho hong.
Here, drink water.	Mona, noa metsi.
To use it is to love it.	Ho e sebelisa ke ho e rata.
I know a good place.	Ke tseba sebaka se setle.
Today, this is no longer a symbol of power.	Kajeno, sena ha e sa le setšoantšo sa matla.
Except it wasn't.	Ntle le hore e ne e se.
People like to spend time with fun people.	Batho ba rata ho qeta nako le batho ba monate.
I do not know why we are here.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha re le mona.
I did not know.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe.
We handle this.	Re tšoara sena.
Today, no.	Kajeno, ha ho na.
I'm not even dressed.	Ha kea apara le ho apara.
I am not a mother to them.	Ha ke mme le bona.
He is truly better than my father.	Ruri o feta ntate.
And of course, the team does nothing.	Mme ehlile, sehlopha ha se etse letho.
And you are the first.	'Me u pele.
To me though.	Ho 'na leha ho le joalo.
Little did she know that this was going to be something she had to do.	O ne a sa tsebe hore sena e ne e tla ba ntho eo a lokelang ho e etsa.
You have to be the whole team.	U tlameha ho ba sehlopha sohle.
They found it difficult to keep up the work.	Ba ile ba fumana ho le thata ho tsoela pele ka mosebetsi.
Or for me.	Kapa bakeng sa ka.
But really there was nothing for it.	Empa ka 'nete ho ne ho se letho bakeng sa eona.
I did not feel well that night.	Ha kea ka ka ikutloa hantle bosiung boo.
Or so we think.	Kapa re nahana joalo.
However, it is my Father's decision.	Leha ho le joalo, ke qeto ea Ntate.
He had never heard of them, as he had heard them.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a li utloa, joalo ka ha a ile a li utloa.
It took longer than that.	Ho ile ha nka nako e telele ho feta.
The young man is always in pain.	Mohlankana o lula a utloile bohloko.
And a man.	Le monna.
I believe people speak well.	Ke lumela hore batho ba bolela hantle.
He makes enough money.	O etsa chelete e lekaneng.
I'm sure it was you.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore e ne e le uena.
I like it that way.	Ke e rata joalo.
He became even more skeptical.	O ile a qala ho belaela le ho feta.
Everything is equal.	Lintho tsohle li lekana.
It's not wrong.	Ha se phoso.
If others helped.	Haeba ba bang ba ile ba thusa.
I take it and drink it.	Kea e nka ebe ke noa.
Without forgetting, too.	Ntle le lebala, hape.
He thought they would not be in danger anytime soon.	O ile a nahana hore ha ba na ho ba kotsing haufinyane.
I can't tell you that, of course.	Nke ke ka o bolella seo, ehlile.
We need to go further.	Re hloka ho tsamaea ho feta.
But we did not keep him for long.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra mo boloka nako e telele.
It was fun to do so.	Ho ne ho le monate ho etsa joalo.
I did not ask you to do that!	Ha kea u kopa ho etsa joalo!
All of this works well.	Sena sohle se sebetsa hantle.
Life is not always easy.	Bophelo ha bo bonolo joaloka pele.
There is nothing we can do.	Ha ho letho leo re ka le etsang.
If you are happy, say so.	Haeba u thabile, bua joalo.
And if the day comes, go.	'Me haeba letsatsi le fihla, u tsamaee.
I made money.	Ke entse chelete.
No, it is not.	Che, ha se 'nete.
I knew it well.	Ke ne ke e tseba hantle.
He cried out, begging for help.	O ile a lla, a kōpa thuso.
That we are a family.	Hore re lelapa.
We'll just stay right here.	Re tla dula hantle feela mona.
I'm really learning.	Ruri kea ithuta.
That was all he needed.	Ke sona feela seo a neng a se hloka.
Location, space, space.	Sebaka, sebaka, sebaka.
I read this question, but it was not my problem.	Ke ile ka bala potso ena, empa e ne e se bothata ba ka.
However, you are too dangerous to play with yourself.	Leha ho le joalo, u kotsi haholo ho bapala le uena.
It was a good idea.	E ne e le tlhahiso e ntle.
Well, except for one.	Hantle, ntle le e le 'ngoe.
You know these people.	Batho bana o ba tseba.
He tried, but could not understand.	O ile a leka, empa a sitoa ho utloisisa.
I can't sleep.	Ha ke khone ho robala.
I think no one can.	Ke nahana hore ha ho motho ea ka khonang.
The family could not afford to buy food.	Lelapa le ne le sa khone ho reka lijo.
It just seemed new.	Feela e ne e bonahala e le ncha.
I hope you have a wonderful day.	Ke tšepa hore u na le letsatsi le monate.
Coffee is delicious, isn’t it?	Kofi e monate, na ha ho joalo?
I gave him the phone.	Ke ile ka mo fa mohala.
What were you doing last night?	U ne u etsa'ng bosiung ba maobane?
Look back.	Sheba morao.
Every time he comes, he is amazingly beautiful.	Nako le nako ha a tla, o motle ka tsela e makatsang.
I was looking forward to it.	Ke ne ke e lebeletse.
He did not intend this.	O ne a sa rera sena.
Tomorrow, of course, tomorrow.	Hosane, ehlile, hosane.
As it turned out, this paid off.	Kamoo ho neng ho le kateng, sena se ile sa lefa.
But it's something, maybe.	Empa ke ntho e itseng, mohlomong.
I tell you.	Kea le bolella.
He started writing.	A qala ho ngola.
It seemed easy.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le bonolo.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
I really like them.	Ke li rata haholo.
There were no school children in that school.	Sekolong seo ho ne ho se na bana ba sekolo.
Instead, his parents wanted him to do something.	Ho e-na le hoo, batsoali ba hae ba ile ba batla seo a ka se etsang.
Just stay.	Lula feela.
People were at home for the party.	Batho ba ne ba le ha hae bakeng sa mokete.
He makes a lot of sense.	O etsa kelello haholo.
Who knew he had it.	Ke mang ea neng a tseba hore o na le eona.
I'm sorry to say that.	Ke masoabi ho bua joalo.
He could have found it one day.	O ne a ka e fumana ka letsatsi le leng.
There is something very wrong with this.	Ho na le ho hong ho phoso haholo ka sena.
It is very difficult.	Ho thata haholo.
The question is what else can they try.	Potso ke hore na ba ka leka eng hape.
He had to say what he knew.	O ne a lokela ho bolela seo a se tsebang.
The second has an even more surprising mind.	Ea bobeli e na le kelello e makatsang le ho feta.
And powerful.	Le tse matla.
Someone like You.	Motho ea tšoanang le uena.
However, that is not the reason.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se lebaka.
Notice that they are connected in the same way.	Hlokomela hore li kopana ka tsela e tšoanang.
But you already know that.	Empa u se u ntse u tseba seo.
Perhaps it is better to say that he felt.	Mohlomong ho molemo ho re o ile a ikutloa.
He works amazingly well today.	O sebetsa ka tsela e makatsang kajeno.
In the worst way.	Ka tsela e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
This was bad, but it was not the worst.	Sena se ne se le mpe, empa se ne se se mpe ka ho fetisisa.
It did to me.	E entse ho nna.
You didn’t have him, it was the most important thing.	U ne u se na eena, e ne e le eona ntho ea bohlokoa.
This item really did not find it.	Ntho ena ehlile ha ea e fumana.
I do not believe that is the law or should be the law.	Ha ke lumele hore oo ke molao kapa e lokela ho ba molao.
We can refuse to understand them.	Re ka hana ho li utloisisa.
Drive fast if you want to get there quickly.	Khanna kapele haeba u batla ho fihla moo kapele.
Some did not.	Ba bang ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
Of course this is enough.	Ehlile sena sea lekana.
Pain and pleasure.	Bohloko le monate.
What happens happens.	Se etsahalang sea etsahala.
They found it difficult to move on.	Ba ile ba fumana ho le thata ho tsoela pele.
They did just that because of the mistake.	Ba entse joalo feela ka lebaka la phoso.
They took care of them.	Ba ne ba ba hlokomela.
He tried to work carefully.	O ile a leka sebetsa ka hloko.
He needed to return home.	O ne a hloka ho khutlela hae.
More to come soon.	Tse ling li tla tla haufinyane.
You would have been the first to know.	U ka be u bile oa pele oa ho tseba.
It was not real.	E ne e se oa sebele.
Make it fun too.	Etsa hore e be monate hape.
He went out to give her a room.	O ile a tsoa ho ea mo fa kamore.
I wanted to stay strong for him.	Ke ne ke batla ho lula ke le matla bakeng sa hae.
Then he realized that the room was empty.	Eaba o hlokomela hore kamore eo e ne e se na letho.
However it is a mistake.	Leha ho le joalo ke phoso.
I met her last husband, work.	Ke kopane le monna oa hae oa ho qetela, mosebetsi.
He wants to retire after a few years.	O batla ho tlohela mosebetsi ka mor'a lilemo tse 'maloa.
But we have something even more important than this.	Empa re na le ntho ea bohlokoa le ho feta ena.
It never was, it never will be.	Ha ho eso be teng, ha ho sa tla ba jwalo.
They give him water.	Ba mo fa metsi.
He thought it was dangerous at all.	O ne a nahana hore ho kotsi ho hang.
Indeed, it is.	Ka sebele, ho joalo.
And now he does.	Mme jwale o etsa jwalo.
And maybe there was more.	'Me mohlomong ho ne ho e-na le ho feta.
What do you think of the house?	U nahana'ng ka ntlo?
He knew he could not keep this for long.	O ne a tseba hore a ke ke a boloka sena nako e telele.
I love it, though.	Kea e rata, leha ho le joalo.
It's nice to be the best, but it's hard to stay there.	Ho monate ho ba ea molemo ka ho fetisisa, empa ho thata ho lula moo.
He stood back.	A ema morao.
But it was empty.	Empa e ne e se na letho.
However, I wish it could happen more often than it does.	Leha ho le joalo, ke lakatsa eka e ka etsahala hangata ho feta kamoo e etsang kateng.
It's hard to write.	Ho thata ho e ngola.
We never thought he would.	Re ne re sa nahane hore o joalo.
He does and says the things that you think.	O etsa le ho bua lintho tseo u li nahanang.
What he says is so.	Seo a se buang se joalo.
He knew nothing about it.	O ne a sa tsebe letho ka taba eo.
We no longer believe him.	Ha re sa mo lumela.
You ask if you can talk to me.	Ua botsa hore na u ka bua le 'na.
So he had to get a call.	Kahoo o ile a tlameha ho fumana mohala.
He could not walk.	O ne a sitoa ho tsamaea.
I'm talking about the future.	Ke bua ka nako e tlang.
Do not keep them in suspense.	U se ke ua ba boloka ba belaela .
Finally, she decided not to wait.	Qetellong, o ile a etsa qeto ea hore a se ke a ema.
But no one.	Empa haho motho.
I will definitely be doing that again.	Ruri ke tla be ke etsa seo hape.
that's good news!	ke litaba tse monate!
I can't do it right.	Ha ke khone ho e etsa hantle.
I'm sorry about the mistake.	Ke masoabi ka phoso.
The parents were delighted.	Batsoali ba ne ba thabile.
We’re not sure we look good, but we feel better.	Ha re na bonnete ba hore re shebahala hantle, empa re ikutloa re le betere.
That's him.	Ke eena.
I know you were doing a job.	Kea tseba hore u ne u etsa mosebetsi.
She is not better at all.	Ha a betere ho hang.
I walk to work every day.	Ke tsamaea ka maoto ho ea mosebetsing letsatsi le leng le le leng.
He refused and left the room.	O ile a hana 'me a tsoa ka kamoreng.
Use the time as you wish.	Sebelisa nako kamoo u batlang kateng.
Why they should.	Hobaneng ba lokela.
How it goes.	E tsamaea joang.
Although they are bad, they are usually harmless.	Le hoja, li le mpe, hangata ha li na kotsi.
What exactly is it.	Na ehlile ke eng.
Then he returned.	Eaba oa khutla.
That will continue.	Seo se tla tsoela pele.
I can't believe he thinks so.	Ha ke lumele hore o nahana joalo.
He was afraid to talk too much.	O ne a tšaba ho bua haholo.
It's really pretty.	E hlile e ntle haholo.
Because we get anything, anytime, anywhere.	Hobane re fumana eng kapa eng, neng kapa neng, kae kapa kae.
He was close now, close.	O ne a le haufi jwale, a le haufi.
I heard my mother crying.	Ke ile ka utloa ’Mè a lla.
This is not the time to talk about it now.	Ha se nako ea ho bua ka taba ena hona joale.
So they started looking for it.	Kahoo ba qala ho e batla.
Try to fix it before your dog comes with you.	Leka ho e lokisa pele ntja ea hau e tla le uena.
He finished then.	O qetile ka nako eo.
He probably did not read the whole story.	Mohlomong ha a ka a bala taba eo kaofela.
Many of them were just beginning to understand it.	Ba bangata ba bona ba ne ba qala ho e utloisisa.
It may take several years.	E ka nka lilemo tse 'maloa.
It's you.	Ke uena.
He has been around since then.	Haesale a le teng ho tloha ka nako eo.
You just said you did.	U sa tsoa bolela hore u entse joalo.
So this is a very important time.	Kahoo ena ke nako ea bohlokoa haholo.
But they can say something.	Empa ba ka bua ho hong.
I shouldn’t have eaten too much last night.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho ja haholo bosiung ba maobane.
They began to sing.	Ba ile ba qala ho bina.
Ask your doctor ahead of time so you know where to go.	Botsa ngaka ea hau pele ho nako e le hore u tsebe moo u lokelang ho ea teng.
Just really hard.	Hantle feela ka thata.
I really don't know.	Ruri ha ke tsebe.
Sometimes this can help with problems.	Ka linako tse ling sena se ka thusa ka mathata.
He could not decide what to do.	O ne a sitoa ho etsa qeto ea hore na a etse eng.
You know your hair.	U tseba moriri oa hau.
He would not have them.	O ne a ke ke a ba le tsona.
I can take care of them.	Nka ba hlokomela.
However, you know better.	Leha ho le joalo, u tseba betere.
Stay right there.	Dula hantle moo.
Now, water meets something very powerful.	Hona joale, metsi a kopana le ntho e matla haholo.
But this did not last very long.	Empa sena ha sea ka sa nka nako e telele haholo.
He says he thinks they can take one car.	O re o bona eka ba ka nka koloi e le 'ngoe.
I have never found fault with myself.	Ha ke eso fumane phoso ho nna.
He should never be arrested.	Le ka mohla ha aa lokela ho tšoaroa.
We will never know.	Re ke ke ra tseba.
If that was the case, it would have been even more difficult.	Haeba ho ne ho le joalo, e ne e ikutloa e le thata haholoanyane.
He is there for me.	O teng bakeng sa ka.
This was not the time to go back.	Ena e ne e se nako ea ho khutlela morao.
There is a time to have children.	Ho na le nako ea ho ba le bana.
Not bad.	Ha e mpe.
That's their style.	Ke mokhoa oa bona oo.
First, it was even stronger.	Ea pele, e ne e le matla le ho feta.
It has to be fast, though.	E tlameha ho ba kapele, leha ho le joalo.
No one else knew about the baby until now.	Ha ho motho e mong ea neng a tseba ka ngoana ho fihlela joale.
I need to know.	Ke lokela ho tseba.
I know some did.	Kea tseba hore ba bang ba ile ba etsa joalo.
I mean, it's better to sleep.	Ke re, ho molemo ho robala.
We may not do that.	Ho ka etsahala hore re se ke ra etsa joalo.
This is what happens.	Sena ke se etsahalang.
He spoke very quickly.	O ile a bua kapele haholo.
It was the best.	E ne e le molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Because no one really knows what to do with it.	Hobane ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle hore na a etse eng ka eona.
This was real.	Ena e ne e le ea sebele.
It is still possible.	E ntse e ka etsahala.
But we know that sometimes there are.	Empa rea ​​tseba hore ka linako tse ling ho na le.
So, you see.	Ka hona, le a bona.
So he went back with him by the road.	Kahoo a khutla a tsamaea le eena ka tsela.
We both needed to do that.	Ka bobeli re ne re hloka ho etsa joalo.
She is tired of living with him.	O khathetse ke ho lula le eena.
I'm coming here.	Ke tla mona.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
The same is true of this.	Ho joalo le ka sena.
Everything seemed so hard.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e bonahala e le thata haholo.
She is at school.	O sekolong.
It should be very simple.	E lokela ho ba bonolo haholo.
They will tell us where to go.	Ba tla re bolella moo re lokelang ho ya teng.
Most of us thought that this was a mistake.	Ba bangata ba rōna re ne re nahana hore hoo ke phoso.
They will work well.	Ba tla sebetsa hantle.
They are there, and they are looking for us.	Ba teng, mme ba re batla.
I can't be her.	Ha ke khone ho ba eena.
I could not read this.	Ha kea khona ho bala sena.
Time passed.	Nako e ile ea feta.
You should see that.	O lokela ho bona seo.
No, it was not singing.	Che, e ne e se ho bina.
I'm not talking about it to anyone, what you did.	Ha ke bue ka eona ho mang kapa mang, seo u se entseng.
You can do that.	U ka etsa joalo.
No one knows when.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na neng.
And you don't have that.	Hape ha u na taba eo.
And the best.	Le molemo ka ho fetisisa.
This is great, isn't it?	Sena se setle, na ha ho joalo?
Do you have any ideas, questions?	Na u na le maikutlo, lipotso?
I earn a lot of money from it.	Ke fumana chelete e ngata ho eona.
Don't just do it.	U se ke ua e etsa feela.
I stayed with it.	Ke ile ka lula le eona.
Best made the day before.	Molemo ka ho fetisisa o entse letsatsi pele.
To that end, there seems to be a return.	Ho ea joalo, ho bonahala ho e-na le ho khutla.
I have time to think about it.	Ke na le nako ea ho nahana ka eona.
We will get there.	Re tla fihla teng.
He lives alone.	O phela a le mong.
I got a suggestion.	Ke fumane tlhahiso.
He considers it very important.	O e nka e le ea bohlokoa haholo.
That was important to know.	Seo e ne e le sa bohlokoa ho tseba.
He could not walk without it.	O ne a ke ke a tsamaea a se na eona.
Nice to meet you.	Ke thabela ho kopana le wena.
I could see that he wanted to be important.	Ke ne ke bona hore o batla ho ba oa bohlokoa.
I will not stand.	Ha ke sa tla ema.
I just do that.	Ke mpa ke etsa joalo.
Going home from school.	Ho ea hae ha sekolo se tsoa.
That's a simple fact.	Ke ’nete e bonolo.
It's a really fun time.	Ke nako e monate ruri.
It does not have to be new.	Ha ho hlokahale hore e be lintho tse ncha.
Of course that is the case.	Ke ’nete hore ke taba eo.
Getting started.	Ho qala mosebetsi.
We went back very quickly.	Re ile ra khutlela morao kapele haholo.
None of us will ever find a house.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea tla fumana ntlo.
He paid.	O ile a lefa.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
Yet that applies to whatever is there.	Leha ho le joalo seo se sebetsa ho eng kapa eng e teng moo.
He found no one.	A fumana ho se motho.
They should do that.	Ba lokela ho etsa seo.
You got that right.	O fumane seo hantle.
When you get it right, your life is better.	Ha u e fumana hantle, bophelo ba hau bo betere.
That can be very important.	Seo e ka ba sa bohlokoa haholo.
Be sure to tell her you look good.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u mo bolelle hore o shebahala hantle.
It may be necessary.	Ho ka hlokahala.
Others continue to experience health problems.	Ba bang ba tsoela pele ho ba le mathata a bophelo.
Someone had found it.	Motho e mong o ne a e fumane.
But he thought that sometimes they did.	Empa o ne a nahana hore ka linako tse ling ba ne ba etsa joalo.
However, the danger remains.	Leha ho le joalo, kotsi e ntse e le teng.
Tonight was a lot of fun.	Bosiung bona ho bile monate haholo.
I tell you this.	Ke le bolella sena.
He came according to me.	O ile a tla ho ea ka.
We played as one person.	Re ne re bapala re le motho a le mong.
It was just a nice feeling.	Ho ne ho ena le maikutlo a monate feela.
That is why my mother took this job.	Ke kahoo 'mè a ileng a nka mosebetsi ona.
I love these people.	Ke rata batho bana.
So it is good that you are having a hard time.	Kahoo ho monate hore ebe o na le nako e thata.
And that's good for that.	Mme e ntle ho seo.
I can't even talk to you.	Ha ke khone le ho bua le uena.
I think we got it right.	Ke nahana hore re e fumane hantle.
He lived with our son.	O ne a lula le mora oa rōna.
Do it again.	E etse hape.
But that is not the case.	Empa hoo hase taba ea sebele.
If there are people.	Haeba ho na le batho.
I made a mistake.	Ke entse phoso.
We knew we had to do something.	Re ne re tseba hore re lokela ho etsa ho hong.
We were.	Re ne re.
It has never done that.	Ha e so ka e etsa joalo.
How can I do this.	Nka etsa sena joang.
I will always be yours.	Ke tla ba oa hao kamehla.
I wish we could.	Ke lakatsa eka re ka khona.
They had no children, only they did not have them.	Ba ne ba se na bana, ba ne ba se na bona feela.
Nothing.	Haho letho feela.
We had to go through it.	Re ile ra tlameha ho feta ka eona.
I need you as much as I can.	Ke u hloka ka matla kamoo nka khonang.
We will fix it for everyone.	Re tla e lokisa bakeng sa bohle.
Everyone there took things in stride.	E mong le e mong moo o ne a nka lintho e le tsa bohlokoa haholo.
They had one son together.	Ba ne ba e-na le mora a le mong hammoho.
You are not human.	Ha o motho.
His car is very good.	Koloi ea hae e ntle haholo.
We will be friends.	Re tla ba metsoalle.
He said 'maybe not'.	O itse 'mohlomong ha ho joalo'.
I expect the same in the future.	Ke lebeletse se tšoanang nakong e tlang.
You have to finish it.	O tlameha ho e qeta.
I always have so much to learn.	Ke lula ke e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo ke lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
Well, he was here for her, somehow.	Be, o ne a le mona bakeng sa hae, ka tsela e itseng.
That's what he is.	Ke seo a leng sona.
However, he continued.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a tsoela pele.
Once the doctor was in the room, he left immediately.	Hang ha ngaka e se e le ka kamoreng, e ile ea tsamaea kapele.
And it was more than that.	Mme ho ne ho feta moo.
There is a girl.	Ho na le ngoanana.
She looked at him sadly.	A mo sheba ka masoabi.
Because that will happen.	Hobane seo se tla etsahala.
The man had nothing of it.	Monna eo o ne a se na letho la eona.
It wasn't good, but sometimes that didn't matter.	E ne e se ntle, empa ka nako e 'ngoe hoo ho ne ho se na taba.
None of us have ever done that.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea kileng a etsa joalo.
Someone has to buy it for him.	Motho e mong o tlameha ho mo reka.
We traveled for three hours.	Re ile ra tsamaea lihora tse tharo.
People were enjoying the party.	Batho ba ne ba thabela mokete.
I love both of them.	Ke li rata ka bobeli.
It will help you get a job.	E tla u thusa ho fumana mosebetsi.
You will learn to love it.	U tla ithuta ho e rata.
He always does what he thinks is best for me.	O dula a etsa seo a neng a nahana hore se molemo bakeng sa ka.
Tonight, if possible.	Bosiung bona, haeba ho ka etsahala.
It is very easy to try, and it does not take long.	Ho bonolo haholo ho leka, 'me ha ho nke nako.
They were the most important ones.	E ne e le bona ba bohlokoa.
When he was gone.	Ha o ne o ile.
This works.	Sena se sebetsa.
Then he too had gone.	Joale le eena o ne a ile.
But if they leave, they will never come back.	Empa haeba ba tsamaea, ba ke ke ba hlola ba khutla.
There is no way out, there is no way for him.	Ha ho tsela ea ho tsoa, ​​ha ho tsela ea hae.
You can see that.	O ka bona seo.
But he could see nothing.	Empa o ne a sa bone letho.
So it would have been better.	Kahoo e ka be e bile ntho e betere.
It gets high.	E fumana sebaka se phahameng.
The latter came back bad.	Ba morao ba ile ba khutla ba le mpe.
Reading will be very important.	Ho bala ho tla ba bohlokoa haholo.
Moreover, he looked as if he did not want to.	Ho feta moo, a sheba eka ha a batle.
I was not thinking anything at the time.	Ke ne ke sa nahane letho ka nako eo.
But some work, too.	Empa ba bang ba sebetsa, le bona.
One a day.	E 'ngoe ka letsatsi.
I learn a lot.	Ke ithuta haholo .
Or just tell us how you feel.	Kapa u re bolelle feela hore na u ikutloa joang.
News to come to us though.	Litaba tse lokelang ho tla ho rona leha ho le joalo.
It did not seem that long.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka e ne e se nako e telele e le teng.
I doubted he knew everything about it.	Ke ne ke belaela hore o ne a tseba tsohle ka eona.
Well, it looks bad.	Hantle, e shebahala e le mpe.
She was beautiful.	O ne a le motle.
He left with the first chance.	O ile a tloha ka monyetla oa pele.
They refuse to go.	Ba hana ho tsamaea.
So what are we waiting for ?!	Joale re emetse eng?!
I thought for a long time about calling the old guy.	Ke ile ka nahana nako e telele ka ho letsetsa mohlankana oa khale.
That's what it seemed to me.	Ke seo e neng e bonahala ho nna.
But he did not look at it.	Empa ha a ka a e sheba.
I wanted him to go with us.	Ke ne ke batla hore a tsamaee le rōna.
This is certainly true of the people.	Ka sebele sena ke ’nete ho batho.
This requires a decision.	Sena se hloka qeto.
This was no longer true.	Sena e ne e se e se ’nete.
Be sure to tell us what we look like.	Etsa bonnete ba hore o re bolella hore na re shebahala joang.
And you have to do that.	Mme o lokela ho etsa seo.
I thought no one around me knew about it.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ha ho motho ea haufi le 'na ea tsebang ka eona.
I'll talk to you soon.	Ke tla bua le wena haufinyane.
Get out of it.	Tloha ho eona.
You, you know, go with them.	Uena, ua tseba, tsamaea le bona.
Keep up the good work!	Tsoela pele ka mosebetsi o motle!
So, we do not think of such a time.	Kahoo, ha re nahane ka nako e joalo.
He really was there.	O ne a hlile a le teng.
They are very good.	Li ntle haholo.
But in reality things are worse than that.	Empa ha e le hantle lintho li mpe ho feta moo.
Only then would he agree to leave.	Ke ka nako eo feela a neng a tla lumela ho tsamaea.
Of course, some people can still write.	Ehlile, batho ba bang ba ntse ba ka ngola.
I knew him well.	Ke ne ke mo tseba hantle.
He cried when they came in.	O ile a lla ha ba kena.
This makes me one of our own right now.	Sena se etsa hore ke be oa rona hona joale.
And he told me everything.	Mme a mpolella tsohle.
Finally they see it.	Qetellong ba e bona.
I'm trying.	kea leka.
I can take a girl for a day.	Nka ngoanana ka letsatsi.
You do not know what is happening.	Ha o tsebe se etsahalang.
That was the last thing he wanted.	Ke ntho ya ho qetela eo a neng a tla e batla.
He will work well.	O tla sebetsa hantle.
It seems.	Ho bonahala.
I looked and looked.	Ke ile ka sheba 'me ka sheba.
But now she is OK.	Empa hona joale o ntse a phela hantle.
He refuses to leave.	O hana ho tsamaea.
He just exists.	O teng feela.
He knew it was fun.	O ne a tseba hore ho monate.
The same is true of a man.	Ho joalo le ka monna.
He went home.	O ile hae.
He enjoyed being close to her.	O ne a thabela ho ba haufi le eena.
I had to tell Dad.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho bolella Ntate.
No one had ever been there.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a ea moo.
If he has no money, he will not pay.	Haeba a se na chelete, a ke ke a lefa.
However, indeed.	Leha ho le joalo, ka sebele.
We think of you every day.	Re nahana ka uena letsatsi le letsatsi.
How did I know.	Ke ne ke tseba joang.
I don't know what kind, or where.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke mofuta ofe, kapa kae.
I hope you understand what I am saying.	Kea tšepa u utloisisa seo ke se buang.
We were very happy.	Re ne re thabile haholo.
I asked who he was.	Ke ile ka botsa hore na ke mang.
They should be able to understand it from there.	Ba lokela ho khona ho e utloisisa ho tloha moo.
So the question came to an end.	Kahoo potso ena e ile ea fihla qetellong.
Here is another good one.	E 'ngoe e betere ke ena.
This gives you an opportunity to spend more money.	Sena se u fa monyetla oa ho sebelisa chelete e ngata ho feta.
We do not talk.	Ha re bue.
He does not want to return.	Ha a batle ho khutla.
I want to enter that room.	Ke batla ho kena ka phaposing eo.
But the problems continue.	Empa mathata a ntse a tsoela pele.
It was as if he were waiting for us.	Eka o ne a re emetse.
You just want something else.	U mpa u batla ho hong hape.
Try something new.	Leka ntho e ncha.
Stop now, baby!	Ema joale, ngoana!
This was not in his opinion.	Sena e ne e se ka maikutlo a hae.
He finally spoke to me.	Qetellong a bua le ’na.
It had the same things.	E ne e e-na le lintho tse tšoanang.
Several were already crying.	Ba ’maloa ba ne ba se ba lla.
I would not have expected this to happen.	Ke ne nke ke ka lebella hore sena se tla etsahala.
But it was not the only place he loved.	Empa e ne e se eona feela sebaka seo a neng a se rata.
I thought he looked a little tired, though, actually.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o shebahala a khathetse hanyane, leha ho le joalo, ha e le hantle.
In it, we can use.	Ho eona, re ka sebelisa.
Or your feet.	Kapa maoto a hao.
He stepped back quickly.	O ile a khutlela morao kapele.
He felt like a professional.	O ne a ikutloa a le setsebi.
I could not understand them.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho li utloisisa.
They don't see you for who you are.	Ha ba u bone ka seo u leng sona.
I need to work with my hands today.	Ke hloka ho sebetsa matsoho kajeno.
And here.	Mme mona.
It makes everyone think.	E etsa hore bohle ba nahane.
He asked if you could have his time today.	O ile a botsa hore na u ka ba le nako ea hae kajeno.
But they did not say much.	Empa ha ba ka ba bua haholo.
It is never too late.	Ha ho mohla morao haholo.
I will wear the same clothes.	Ke tla apara liaparo tse tšoanang.
I knew something was up.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ho na le ho hong.
For the older version, you probably don't have to do anything.	Bakeng sa mofuta oa khale, mohlomong ha ua tlameha ho etsa letho.
That was fun.	Seo se ne se le monate.
I have a problem.	Ke na le bothata.
Like what they say.	Joalo ka seo ba se buang.
You do what you have to do.	O etsa seo o lokelang ho se etsa.
We believe he does not need to do that.	Re lumela hore ha ho hlokahale hore a etse joalo.
I did not have much help.	Ke ne ke se na thuso e ngata.
I'm tired of driving so far.	Ke khathetse ke ho khanna ho fihlela mona.
He will return.	O tla khutla.
Always before he allowed them to look for him.	Kamehla pele a ba lumella hore ba mo batle.
That is very important to her.	Seo se bohlokoa haholo ho eena.
It already exists, always.	E se e le teng, kamehla.
Of course, they would.	Ehlile, ba ne ba tla etsa joalo.
Coffee is very strong.	Kofi e matla haholo.
It was fun to do.	Ho ne ho le monate ho etsa.
I have seen what your hands are doing.	Ke bone seo matsoho a hao a se etsang.
It's yours for the next few hours.	Ke oa hau lihora tse 'maloa tse tlang.
This may seem daunting but it is a simple fact.	Sena se ka bonahala se le thata empa ke 'nete e bonolo.
Do whatever you used to do.	Etsa eng kapa eng eo u neng u tloaetse ho e etsa.
He stays there while he works.	O lula moo ha a ntse a sebetsa.
I am not guilty of that.	Ha ke na molato bakeng sa seo.
I'm going to find out what's wrong.	Ke ya fumana hore molato ke eng.
Once you have finished using it.	Hang ha u qetile ho e sebelisa.
The fall was just about to come.	Ho oa ho ne ho se ho tla feela.
We never played our favorite games.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra bapala tseo re li ratang.
I think about that sometimes.	Ke nahana ka seo ka linako tse ling.
When it’s hard, the tough ones keep going.	Ha ho le thata, ba thata baa tsoela pele.
That's when he decided to believe.	Ke moo a ileng a etsa qeto ea ho lumela.
More than once, to be honest.	Ho feta hang, ho bua 'nete.
Some may have both.	Ba bang ba ka ba le tsona ka bobeli.
So do not think.	Kahoo u se ke ua nahana.
It was still not enough.	E ne e ntse e sa lekana.
It is indeed a very dangerous job.	Ruri ke mosebetsi o kotsi haholo.
We work well and that is great.	Re sebetsa ka tsela e ntle mme seo se setle haholo.
Have you ever thought about what you would say?	Na u kile ua nahana ka seo u neng u tla se bua?
I really need them.	Ke li hloka haholo.
I don’t think of it as old.	Ha ke nahane ka eona e le ea khale.
I don't need to read a lot of books.	Ha ke hloke ho bala libuka tse ngata.
This was a difficult decision.	Ena e ne e le qeto e boima.
He read about such things.	O ne a bala ka lintho tse joalo.
It's just weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang feela.
You can do better than that.	O ka etsa betere ho feta moo.
I just want to make you think.	Ke batla feela ho etsa hore u nahane.
When we meet again.	Ha re kopana hape.
At the time we were pretty sure he didn’t see us.	Ka nako eo re ne re na le bonnete ba hore ha a re bone.
I will not tell anyone.	Nke ke ka bolella motho.
I hope he will do it.	Ke tšepa hore o tla e etsa.
He is very important to us.	O bohlokoa haholo ho rona.
Now I can walk again.	Hona joale ke khona ho tsamaea hape.
She was reading to him as he played.	O ne a ntse a mo bala ha a ntse a bapala.
You have to stay human.	O lokela ho dula o le motho.
There was nothing to that.	Ho ne ho se na letho ho seo.
Then they decided.	Eaba joale ba etsa qeto.
We were playing and just walking.	Re ne re bapala 'me re tsamaea feela.
Everyone knew it.	Bohle ba ne ba e tseba.
I saw that he did not.	Ke ile ka bona hore ha a etse joalo.
Be careful.	Hlokomela.
You can't have both.	U ke ke ua ba le eona ka bobeli.
I was going to work.	Ke ne ke ilo sebetsa.
No, it is not real at all.	Che, ha se ntho ea sebele ho hang.
And of course, start small.	Mme ehlile, qala hanyane.
When he walks into the room, he knows something is wrong.	Ha a kena ka phaposing, oa tseba hore ho na le phoso.
Good family news can happen.	Litaba tse monate tsa lelapa li ka etsahala.
He was the best, and he knew it.	E ne e le eena ea molemo ka ho fetisisa, 'me o ne a e tseba.
It's really pretty.	E hlile e ntle haholo.
How many years.	Lilemo tse kae.
I really didn't want to go.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa batle ho ea.
Everyone was saving things, saving them instead of using them.	E mong le e mong o ne a boloka lintho, a li boloka ho e-na le ho li sebelisa.
The same is true of his diet.	Ho joalo le ka lijo tsa hae.
And we'll leave it right there.	Mme re tla e tlohela hona moo.
Because we work hard.	Hobane re sebetsa ka thata.
I'm not so sure about that mom.	Ha ke na bonnete haholo ka seo mme.
There is no way to know for sure, it is.	Haho mokhoa oa ho tseba hantle, ho joalo.
That is the true path to power.	Ke eona tsela ea 'nete ea matla.
Hopefully we will continue to overcome them going forward.	Re tšepa hore re tla tsoela pele ho li hlola ho ea pele.
You need someone.	U hloka motho.
The truth is even worse.	'Nete e mpe le ho feta.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
No, wait, it's there.	Che, ema, e teng.
He would like to know what happened to me.	A ka rata ho tseba hore na ho etsahetse'ng ka 'na.
I know it's going to happen.	Ke a tseba e tla etsahala.
I can refuse.	Nka khona ho hana.
Have you found a mistake?	Na u se u fumane phoso?
One location group with only one location available.	Sehlopha se le seng sa sebaka se nang le sebaka se le seng feela se teng.
He had no problem with that.	O ne a sena bothata ka seo.
We are not alone.	Ha re batho ba le bang.
He told us he knew nothing.	O ile a re bolella hore ha a tsebe letho.
I will go now.	Ke tla tsamaea hona joale.
You too are beautiful.	Le uena u motle.
His problem is even more serious.	Bothata ba hae bo boima le ho feta.
So to speak.	Kahoo ho bua.
But it was not easy.	Empa ho ne ho se bonolo.
He can live with that.	A ka phela le seo.
I love that baby.	Ke rata ngoana eo.
We will always help.	Re tla lula re thusa.
Otherwise, you would not be living in it.	Ho seng joalo, u ka be u sa lula ho eona.
You do not need much.	Ha o hloke haholo.
The decision must stand.	Qeto e tlameha ho ema.
And she is strong.	Mme o thata.
But it is your responsibility to take care of yours.	Empa ke mosebetsi oa hau ho hlokomela tsa hau.
Not even money.	Leha e le chelete.
Now that was gone.	Jwale seo se ne se ile.
They want to see it.	Ba batla ho e bona.
Soon I began to feel stronger.	Kapele ke ile ka qala ho ikutloa ke le matla.
It was fun for them.	Ho ne ho le monate ho bona.
When it came in front of me, it stopped.	Ha e fihla pele ho nna, ya ema.
They may be injured.	Ba ka 'na ba tsoa kotsi.
We did not leave.	Ha rea ​​ka ra tsamaea.
Stand where you want.	Ema moo o batlang.
We are working.	Re ntse re sebetsa.
Sometimes we went with it, sometimes we did not go with it.	Ka linako tse ling re ne re tsamaea le eona, ka linako tse ling re sa tsamaee le eona.
It was the only time we saw him.	E ne e le eona feela nako eo re ileng ra mo bona.
You can usually find what you are looking for.	Hangata u ka fumana ho eona seo u se batlang.
We will give them what they want.	Re tl’o ba fa seo ba se batlang.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se joalo.
Reading or eating.	Ho bala kapa ho ja.
We do not take it one way at a time.	Ha re e nke mokhoa o le mong ka nako.
Do not do that because that would be dangerous.	O seke wa etsa seo hobane seo se ka ba kotsi.
Everything was better than nothing.	Tsohle li ne li le betere ho feta letho.
If you want to retrieve it, we don't have much time.	Ha u batla ho e batla hape, ha re na nako e ngata.
I can't understand it.	Ha ke khone ho e utloisisa.
I was human.	Ke ne ke le motho.
However, it is still good.	Leha ho le joalo, e ntse e le ntle.
All they need is food.	Seo ba se hlokang feela ke lijo.
They want to get in.	Ba batla ho kena.
He has a family.	O na le lelapa.
So we are no longer watching this.	Kahoo ha re sa shebella sena.
She is hurt.	O utloile bohloko.
Her hair is beautiful.	Moriri oa hae o motle.
I will try it.	Ke tla e leka.
The bike goes well.	Baesekele e tsamaea hantle.
Do one at a time.	Etsa e le 'ngoe ka nako.
I certainly did.	Ka sebele ke ile ka etsa joalo.
I'm really sorry about this.	Ruri ke masoabi ka sena.
He was not the only dog ​​who liked to visit a nearby house.	E ne e se ntja feela e neng e rata ho etela ntlo e haufi.
He started this.	O ile a qala sena.
He knew nothing about them.	O ne a sa tsebe letho ka tsona.
All this right here.	Tsena tsohle hantle mona.
So now we know what's going on.	Kahoo joale re tseba se etsahalang.
Sometimes we will need money.	Ka nako e 'ngoe re tla hloka chelete.
If you have any more questions, ask.	Haeba u na le lipotso tse ling hape, botsa.
It is to him as an expert.	Ke ho eena joalo ka setsebi.
Well some of them were simple.	Hantle tse ling tsa tsona li ne li le bonolo.
School will start next week.	Sekolo se tla qala bekeng e tlang.
Obviously this is not the case here.	Ho hlakile hore sena ha se joalo mona.
This picture is very important.	Setšoantšo sena se bohlokoa haholo.
They go home and have supper.	Ba ea hae 'me ba ja lijo tsa mantsiboea.
You will see your son.	O tla bona mora wa hao.
He was the first in his team.	E ne e le eena oa pele sehlopheng sa hae.
Get out of.	Tsoa ho.
I had to do something about him.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho etsa ho hong ka eena.
A nice, simple car.	Koloi e ntle, e bonolo.
I'm not saying it's yours.	Ha ke re e be tsa hao.
I know how it is.	Kea tseba hore na ho joang.
I try to see the best in everything.	Ke leka ho bona se molemo ho tsohle.
That's what we're talking about here.	Ke seo re buang ka sona mona.
You can help.	O ka thusa.
We just have to find a way to do it.	Re tlameha feela ho fumana mokhoa oa ho e etsa.
Make no mistake about it.	U se ke ua etsa phoso ka sena.
Books never mention that last group.	Libuka ha ho mohla li buang ka sehlopha seo sa ho qetela.
Therefore, we may not think about this.	Ka hona, re ka ’na ra se ke ra nahana ka taba ena.
There is a way to do both.	Ho na le mokhoa oa ho li etsa ka bobeli.
You can save it if you want.	U ka e boloka ha u batla.
Some people used his work that way, of course.	Batho ba bang ba ile ba sebelisa mosebetsi oa hae ka tsela eo, ehlile.
And that makes it very visible.	Mme seo se etsa hore e bonahale haholo.
We're almost there.	Re se re tla fihla moo.
They left very quickly.	Ba ile ba tsamaea kapele haholo.
I just saw that.	Ke sa tsoa bona taba eo.
The place is still there.	Sebaka se ntse se le teng.
He did not own a car.	O ne a sena koloi.
That's what he knew.	Ke seo a neng a se tseba.
But, well.	Empa, hantle.
You did better.	U entse betere.
You will not see many of them now.	U ke ke ua bona ba bangata ba bona hona joale.
I am constantly learning.	Ke ntse ke ithuta kamehla.
We all need it.	Kaofela rea ​​hlokahala.
From one strange to the other.	Ho tloha ho tse ling tse makatsang ho ea ho tse ling.
I thought there were good times.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho na le linako tse monate.
They said it would not be a problem.	Ba itse e ke ke ea e-ba bothata.
That made it easier for them.	Seo se ile sa etsa hore ho be bonolo ho bona.
We decided to swim.	Re ile ra etsa qeto ea ho sesa.
You would know.	U ne u tla tseba.
And if there is a mistake, we will fix it.	'Me haeba ho na le phoso, re tla e lokisa.
He said.	O ile a re.
He was sure he would try again.	O ne a na le bonnete ba hore o tla leka hape.
I was not sure which one.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ke efe.
We will never find them again.	Ha re sa tla hlola re li fumana.
But he knew who he was.	Empa o ne a tseba hore na ke mang.
It looks good on you.	E shebahala hantle ho uena.
You may have heard the news.	Mohlomong u utloile litaba.
Then we just have to go do it.	Joale re tlameha feela ho ea ho e etsa.
That was fun to see.	Seo se ne se le monate ho se bona.
Some things provided strength.	Lintho tse ling li ile tsa fana ka matla.
Or a party.	Kapa mokete.
It was a wonderful time, to be honest.	E ne e le nako e monate haholo, ho bua 'nete.
Some of them even came to play with me.	Ba bang ba bona ba bile ba tla ho tla bapala le 'na.
He knew he would refuse.	O ne a tseba hore o tla hana.
I have to stay together.	Ke tlameha ho lula hammoho.
Because maybe you will never come back.	Hobane mohlomong ha u sa tla khutla.
However, you want the truth.	Leha ho le joalo, u batla 'nete.
Her parents never had their place.	Batsoali ba hae ha ho mohla ba kileng ba ba le sebaka sa bona.
I need to.	Ke hloka.
We do not know what will happen.	Ha re tsebe se tla etsahala.
There will be no problems.	Ha ho na ho ba le mathata.
I don't understand it, but something is happening.	Ha ke e utloisise, empa ho na le ntho e etsahalang.
It has all its elements.	E na le lintho tsohle tsa eona.
Now, very much.	Jwale, haholo.
I wanted to move on.	Ke ne ke batla ho tsoela pele.
Sometimes good, sometimes bad.	Ka nako e 'ngoe e ntle, ka linako tse ling e mpe.
Things started to move quickly.	Lintho li ile tsa qala ho tsamaea kapele.
He had said nothing more.	O ne a eso bue letho ho feta moo.
Now you are alone.	Joale u se u le mong.
I just wanted to be a kid.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba ngoana feela.
He was the strongest of them all.	O ne a le matla ho feta bohle.
No, they are good.	Che, li ntle.
I had to confess my guilt.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho bolela molato oa ka.
They don't think about them.	Ha ba nahane ka tsona.
But they already knew him.	Empa ba ne ba se ba ntse ba mo tseba.
I mean not.	Ke bolela hore ha ho joalo.
But he had to get out.	Empa o ile a tlameha ho tsoa.
We left.	Re ile ra tsamaea.
So, you cry.	Kahoo, ua lla.
It was not easy to do so.	Ho ne ho se bonolo ho etsa joalo.
He looked great.	O ne a shebahala a le moholo.
They have their time, just like everything else.	Ba na le nako ea bona, joalo ka lintho tse ling kaofela.
Which is the second.	Ea bobeli ke efe.
He was used to having it now.	O ne a se a tloaetse ho ba le eona joale.
We can't go anywhere.	Re ke ke ra ea sebakeng se seng le se seng.
I can write like you.	Nka ngola joalo ka uena.
He obviously has his thing.	Ho hlakile hore o na le ntho ea hae.
Man, it was fun!	Monna, ho ne ho le monate!
Still, the news was good.	Leha ho le joalo, litaba li ne li le monate.
Everyone has to move at a certain time.	Motho e mong le e mong o tlameha ho tsamaea ka nako e itseng.
In front was a large man.	Ka pele ho ne ho ena le monna e moholo.
I was there on time!	Ke ne ke le teng ka nako!
But that was where he was.	Empa ke moo a neng a le teng.
You can't have that.	O ka se be le seo.
That, to me, didn't make much sense.	Eo, ho nna, e neng e sa etse kelello e ngata.
Obviously we needed it.	Ho hlakile hore re ne re e hloka.
It had been three years there.	E ne e se e le lilemo tse tharo moo.
It's none of my business.	Ha se taba ea ka.
When you walk out tonight, you will have it.	Ha u tsamaea bosiung bona, u tla ba le eona.
He wished he could read his thoughts.	O ne a lakatsa eka a ka bala maikutlo a hae.
I did not go to school.	Ha kea ea sekolong.
Stop and think.	Ema 'me u nahane.
I would be.	Nka ba.
This is not a.	Sena ha se a.
I will not be.	nke ke ka ba teng.
He would know what was going on.	O ne a tla tseba se etsahalang.
I'll talk to them about it, and take it from there.	Ke tla bua le bona ka eona, 'me u e nke ho tloha moo.
Yet it is nothing.	Leha ho le joalo hase letho.
This should work.	Sena se lokela ho sebetsa.
Moreover, however, only a few have to deal with.	Ho feta moo, leha ho le joalo, ke tse seng kae feela tse lokelang ho kopana le tsona.
He is with us.	O na le rona.
So what did you do that night?	Joale u ile ua etsa’ng bosiung boo?
His girlfriend had done it.	Ngoanana oa hae o ne a e entse.
From today, they would be able to enter.	Ho tloha kajeno, ba ne ba ka khona ho kena.
I will never speak.	Nke ke ka bua le ka mohla.
She looks tired.	A bonahala a khathetse.
Thank you very much.	Ke leboha haholo.
I think that's why everyone loves him.	Ke nahana hore ke kahoo bohle ba mo ratang.
Your son is beautiful.	Mora oa hao e motle.
That's a lot of money.	Ke chelete e ngata.
And make no mistake about it.	Mme o seke wa etsa phoso.
He begged her not to go.	A mo kopa hore a se ke a tsamaea.
I don't know what else I can do.	Ha ke tsebe hore na nka etsa eng hape.
I went back a little bit to see where he was.	Ke ile ka khutlela morao hanyane ho ea bona moo a leng teng.
Expect arrival in three days.	Lebella ho fihla ka mor'a matsatsi a mararo.
Mother and son.	Mme le mora.
But then he realized that he had made a mistake.	Empa joale o ile a hlokomela hore o entse phoso.
Everyone expected the job to be someone else's problem.	E mong le e mong o ne a lebeletse hore mosebetsi e be bothata ba motho e mong.
So we need your help, but we will stand by you, too.	Kahoo re hloka thuso ea hau, empa re tla ema le uena, hape.
It still exists.	E ntse e le teng.
Hard time.	Nako e thata.
Like a few, of course.	Joalo ka tse 'maloa, ha e le hantle.
I did not want to go.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho ea.
One line.	Mohala o le mong.
The second was a great opportunity.	Ea bobeli e ne e le monyetla o moholo.
And more important.	Le ea bohlokoa ho feta.
He did not look at her.	Ha aa ka a mo sheba.
And I realized that maybe this is a better place.	'Me ke ile ka hlokomela hore mohlomong ena ke sebaka se betere.
Pain that he never thought he would forget.	Bohloko boo a neng a sa nahane hore o tla ke a bo lebala.
We were! 	Re ne re le joalo!
I thought he said he wanted to help.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o itse o batla ho thusa.
No offense, be careful.	Ha ho na molato, hlokomela.
.	.
That wasn't easy, let me tell you.	Hoo ho ne ho se bonolo, e re ke o bolelle.
I don't even know who she is.	Ha ke tsebe le hore na o mang.
I am busy.	Ke phathahane.
But we do not know.	Empa ha re tsebe seo.
We are sorry.	Re masoabi.
It would be very easy.	Ho ne ho tla ba bonolo haholo.
They are sleeping.	Ba robala.
He loved someone very much.	O ne a rata motho haholo.
Or both of us.	Kapa bobeli ba rona.
The sooner you do it, the better.	Ha u e etsa kapele, ho molemo.
You could see them begin to understand that.	U ne u ka ba bona ba qala ho utloisisa seo.
So, too, they could see.	Kahoo, le bona ba ne ba ka ba bona.
He thanked.	O ile a leboha.
Or it is not just a danger.	Kapa ha se kotsi feela.
The first thing he ever said to her.	Ntho ea pele eo e kileng ea e bua ho eena.
First of all, time.	Pele ho tsohle, nako.
Driving time will begin soon.	Nako ea ho khanna e tla qala haufinyane.
I like when a man opens the car door.	Ke rata ha monna a bula lemati la koloi.
You can do your job, because you have to do it.	O ka etsa mosebetsi wa hao, hobane o tlameha ho o etsa.
But you know it happens.	Empa ua tseba hore hoa etsahala.
You hope so.	U tšepa hore ho joalo.
I did not go back.	Ha kea ka ka khutlela morao.
They were with me and knew it.	Ba ne ba na le nna mme ba e tseba.
You would have time.	U ne u tla ba le nako.
She looked at him sincerely.	A mo sheba ka 'nete.
This whole thing.	Ntho ena kaofela.
He could have anything he wanted to eat.	O ne a ka ba le ntho leha e le efe eo a batlang ho e ja.
It really helped her.	E ile ea mo tsoela molemo haholo.
Wait a few days and say.	Ema matsatsi a 'maloa u re.
Maybe it was painful.	Mohlomong e bile e bohloko.
I treat her with such things every time we meet.	Ke mo tšoara ka lintho tsa mofuta ona nako le nako ha re kopana.
Their life is not your life.	Bophelo ba bona ha se bophelo ba hau.
It happens, man.	Hoa etsahala, monna.
That someone close to you betrayed you.	Hore ea haufi le uena a u eka.
All we have to do is meet together as one people.	Seo re hlokang ho se etsa feela ke ho kopana re le batho ba le bang.
Do not use more than you like.	Se ke oa sebelisa ho feta kamoo u ratang.
I just wanted to forget about it.	Ke ne ke batla ho lebala ka eona feela.
All the best in the end.	Tsohle tse molemo qetellong.
He can't help it.	A ke ke a e thusa.
How many more?	Ho na le tse kae hape?
I met another recently.	Ke ile ka kopana le e 'ngoe haufinyane.
He felt like that.	O ne a ikutloa eka ke seo a leng sona.
You have a lot of money.	U na le chelete e ngata.
Never learn anything.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua ithuta letho.
I like that.	Ke rata seo.
You know where you are, of course.	O tseba moo o leng teng, ehlile.
It means everything to me.	E bolela tsohle ho nna.
I heard nothing from them.	Ha kea utloa letho ho tsoa ho bona.
It certainly was.	Ruri ho ne ho le jwalo.
We look forward to seeing him tomorrow.	Re mo lebeletse hosane.
We had a great time.	Re bile le e monate.
This comes with space.	Sena se tla le sebaka.
He said he did not know why.	O ile a re ha a tsebe lebaka.
I can't say it happened.	Nke ke ka re e bile teng.
He wondered.	A ipotsa.
It was fun for him to do so.	Ho bile monate ho eena ho etsa joalo.
This is bad news.	Tsena ke litaba tse mpe.
It made him walk away fast.	Se ile sa etsa hore a tsamaee kapele.
It is not a place I would like to live.	Hase sebaka seo nka ratang ho lula ho sona.
They start eating.	Ba qala ho ja.
Well, he better not have it.	Be, ho molemo hore a se be le eona.
He wants to pay.	O batla ho lefa.
However, I am not your father.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke ntate oa hao.
It was before.	E ne e le pele.
A lot has happened since then.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahetseng ho tloha ka nako eo.
Then he would love her.	Joale o ne a tla mo rata.
Sorry it had to be you.	Ke masoabi e ne e lokela ho ba uena.
We still do not know if this method works.	Re ntse re sa tsebe hore na mokhoa ona oa sebetsa.
I am human.	Ke motho.
Who could want after what he did.	Ke mang ea neng a ka batla ka mor'a seo a se entseng.
It will not work.	E ke ke ea sebetsa.
That was not the case.	Taba e ne e se eona eo.
He wants to know why.	O batla ho tseba lebaka.
He tried her.	O ile a mo leka.
That can be difficult.	Hoo ho ka ’na ha e-ba thata.
My car was going well.	Koloi ea ka e ne e tsamaea hantle.
I really helped with the kids.	Ke ne ke na le thuso ka bana ka 'nete.
It should work both.	E lokela ho sebetsa ka bobeli.
This does not seem to be the case.	Sena ha se bonahale se le joalo.
He helps many people.	O thusa batho ba bangata.
It will be an emotional week.	E tla ba beke ea maikutlo.
People were talking about it then.	Batho ba ne ba e bua ka nako eo.
I read it.	Ke ile ka e bala.
I'm not sure why.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng ha ho le joalo.
Maybe he did not understand them either.	Mohlomong le eena o ne a sa li utloisise.
She was crying all the time.	O ne a ntse a lla ka nako eohle.
It would have been a little painful.	E ne e tla be e se e le bohloko hanyane.
You can learn this.	U ka ithuta sena.
Save time and money.	Boloka nako le chelete.
Do whatever you want to do.	Etsa eng kapa eng eo u batlang ho e etsa.
She reads a lot.	O bala haholo.
I went to see them.	Ke ile ka ea ho bona.
If you can keep going, well and really.	Haeba u khona ho tsoela pele, hantle le hantle.
I decided, says the man.	Ke entse qeto, ho bolela monna eo.
We need to go to bed early.	Re lokela ho robala kapele.
I need to buy new shoes.	Ke hloka ho reka lieta tse ncha.
It is best not to go out at night.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua tsoa bosiu.
He also loves to travel.	Hape o rata ho tsamaea.
He used them.	O ile a li sebelisa.
But he could stand.	Empa o ne a ka ema.
There was no one else there.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong moo.
Not just me.	E seng 'na feela.
This is very clear.	Sena se hlakile haholo.
We have to ask him.	Re tlameha ho mo botsa.
He said nothing at all.	Ha aa ka a bua letho ho hang.
It doesn't know what's wrong.	Ha e tsebe phoso.
She likes to be alone.	O rata ho dula a le mong.
Assuming this is just for tonight.	Ho nka hore sena ke sa bosiung bona feela.
Use your mind.	Sebelisa kelello ea hau.
And the people who paid first got nothing.	Mme batho ba neng ba lefa pele ba ne ba sa fumane letho.
It was a question.	E ne e le potso.
He is not so important.	Ha a bohlokoa hakaalo.
Very nice and we are fine.	E ntle haholo mme re hantle.
It could have been me.	E ka be e bile nna.
I was even more emotional.	Ke ne ke e-na le maikutlo le ho feta.
Then he saw it.	Eaba oa e bona.
He travels a lot and is always absent.	O tsamaea haholo 'me o lula a le sieo.
I didn't have to ask for anything.	Ke ne ke sa tlameha ho kopa letho.
Best of all, he is one of our people.	Se molemo ka ho fetisisa ke hore, ke e mong oa batho ba rona.
Anything you want to talk about or understand.	Eng kapa eng eo u batlang ho bua ka eona kapa ho e utloisisa.
Or talk to anyone.	Kapa bua le mang kapa mang.
She was crying a lot.	O ne a lla haholo.
Write down your thoughts.	Ngola maikutlo a hau.
But there is nothing we can do.	Empa ha ho letho leo re ka le etsang.
The local children did the same.	Bana ba moo le bona ba ile ba etsa joalo.
Now we knew why.	Joale re ne re tseba lebaka.
Then we had to find someone who would do it.	Joale re ne re tlameha ho fumana motho ea tla li etsa.
This must be a	Sena se tlameha ho ba a
And in fact, he was.	'Me ka 'nete, o ne a le joalo.
He had heard this.	O ne a utloile sena.
I was very grateful.	Ke ile ka leboha haholo.
In a bad way.	Ka tsela e mpe.
Perhaps he was afraid of her.	Mohlomong o ne a mo tšaba.
That would never happen.	Hoo ho ne ho ke ke ha etsahala le ka mohla.
None of them did.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ileng a etsa joalo.
She cried a lot.	O ile a lla haholo.
But it is.	Empa ho joalo.
I think that's a good thing.	Ke nahana hore ke ntho e ntle.
You are awesome.	U motle bo makatsang.
I did not stay.	Ha kea ka ka lula.
He will take it from here.	O tla e nka ho tloha mona.
Something seemed to happen.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ho na le ntho e ileng ea etsahala.
But that is not the way it happened.	Empa ha se tsela eo ho etsahetseng ka eona.
I wanted to be that guy.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba mohlankana eo.
It was not a problem.	E ne e se bothata.
However, none of this happened.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho letho la sena le ileng la etsahala.
Or maybe not.	Kapa mohlomong ha ho joalo.
It helps with everything.	E thusa ka tsohle.
He was arrested unexpectedly.	O ile a tšoaroa a sa lebella.
It is very easy for them.	Ho bonolo haholo ho bona.
This is a very difficult concept to understand.	Ena ke mohopolo o thata haholo ho o utloisisa.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Ho molemo ho feta ho tsamaea.
If you have a problem, just ask, he said.	Haeba u na le bothata, botsa feela, o ile a re.
He made her.	O mo entse.
It was time to think about you.	E ne e le nako ea ho nahana ka uena.
A man who tried to help my wife found this.	Monna ea ileng a leka ho thusa mosali oa ka o ile a fumana sena.
So there is something in common.	Kahoo ho na le seo re tšoanang ka sona.
This will not help you at all.	Sena se ke ke sa u thusa ka letho.
No need.	Ha ho hlokahale.
You will come, won't you?	U tla tla, na ha ho joalo?
The fact is, they never do that.	'Nete ke hore ha ho mohla ba etsang joalo.
The people went on and on without saying a word.	Batho ba ile ba tsoela pele ho feta ba sa bue letho.
It was not so difficult for someone like him.	Ho ne ho se boima hakaalo ho motho ea tšoanang le eena.
I wish it had been more difficult.	Ke lakatsa eka ho ka be ho bile thata le ho feta.
I would not go anywhere.	Ke ne nke ke ka ea kae kapa kae.
Things were bad before.	Lintho li ne li le mpe pele.
I just make it fun.	Ke e etsetsa monate feela.
Many were there.	Ba bangata ba ne ba le teng.
As with life, everyone had his or her own problems.	Joalo ka bophelo, motho e mong le e mong o ne a e-na le mathata a hae.
Money, money, money!	Chelete, chelete, chelete!
She did not tell them how she ended up crying in the morning.	O ne a sa ba bolelle hore na o qetile hoseng ho lla joang.
I can't decide.	Ha ke khone ho etsa qeto.
I understand your amazing feelings.	Ke utloisisa maikutlo a hau a makatsang.
Then it was his turn.	Joale e ne e le monyetla oa hae.
He left without saying a word.	O ile a tsamaea a sa bua letho.
You did a good job for them.	U entse mosebetsi o motle ho bona.
It may not be able to move in time or it may not be able to.	E ka 'na eaba ha e khone ho tsamaea ka nako kapa ha ea ka ea khona.
However, he got it in a second job.	Leha ho le joalo, e ile ea e fumana mosebetsing oa bobeli.
You should try it !.	U lokela ho e leka!.
Previously it was.	Pele e ne e le .
She is my child.	Ke ngoana oa ka.
This would not work.	Sena se ne se sa tlo sebetsa.
What you are is how you spend each day.	Seo u leng sona ke hore na u qeta letsatsi le letsatsi joang.
I need them both.	Ke li hloka ka bobeli.
And we will work on it.	Mme re tla e sebetsa.
I needed to know who made it.	Ke ne ke hloka ho tseba hore na ke mang ea e entseng.
And you will know there.	Mme o tla tseba moo.
Only, of course, he did not say that.	Feela, ha e le hantle, ha aa ka a bua joalo.
I just don't understand it.	Ke mpa ke sa e utloisise.
That was harder than that.	Seo se ne se le thata ho feta seo.
She would like to cry.	A ka rata ho lla.
Yet no one seemed to know it.	Leha ho le joalo ho ne ho bonahala ho se motho e mong ea e tsebang.
He knew nothing.	O ne a sa tsebe letho.
Nothing we had never seen before.	Ha ho letho leo re neng re e-s'o le bone pele.
The girl certainly knew she was beautiful.	Ka sebele ngoanana o ne a tseba hore o motle.
He is still there.	O ntse a le teng.
Thanks for this meal.	Re leboha lijo tsena.
I do not know what it is for.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke bakeng sa eng.
Of course, this is a picture of a person.	Ha e le hantle, sena ke setšoantšo sa motho.
He did not expect them to do so.	O ne a sa lebella hore ba etse jwalo.
The doctor asked her many questions.	Ngaka e ile ea mo botsa lipotso tse ngata.
But he could think of many others.	Empa o ne a ka nahana ka ba bang ba bangata.
But we were happy to be with him.	Empa re ne re thabetse ho ba le eena.
They don't get it.	Ha ba li fumane.
We take it a day.	Re e nka letsatsi.
Everyone thought it was too good.	E mong le e mong o ne a nahana hore e ntle haholo.
All of them.	Kaofela.
One, of course, was time.	E 'ngoe, ho hlakile, e ne e le nako.
You feel like that person.	U ikutloa joaloka motho eo.
They are so fun to watch.	Li monate haholo ho li shebella.
I did not know what to say.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke mo bolelle eng.
Of course, it was caught.	Ehlile, ho ile ha tšoaroa.
Big girl.	Ngoanana e moholo.
You too.	Le uena.
It was not an opportunity.	E ne e se monyetla.
I'm sure you're useless.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ha u na thuso.
I would appreciate any help.	Nka thabela thuso efe kapa efe.
Some stood behind me.	Ba bang ba ile ba ema ka mor'a ka.
Think again about these times, if you can.	Nahana hape ka linako tsena, haeba u ka khona.
But this is not my story.	Empa sena ha se taba ea ka.
I will not let you go.	Nke ke ka o tlohela.
It said he was the best.	E itse ke eena ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Start here.	Qala mona.
You believe what you want to believe.	U lumela seo u batlang ho se lumela.
It was an issue that was not my business.	E ne e le taba eo e neng e se taba ea ka.
Not so bad.	Ha se ntho e mpe hakaalo.
One does not like people very much.	E 'ngoe ha e rate batho haholo.
So there had to be another place.	Kahoo ho ne ho tlameha ho ba le sebaka se seng.
Good work on this.	Mosebetsi o motle ka sena.
You do not have to do anything else.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u etse letho hape.
So it's a very good team, very strong.	Kahoo ke sehlopha se setle haholo, se matla haholo.
There is nothing stronger than this.	Ha ho letho le matla ho feta sena.
You may want to think about that.	U ka lakatsa ho nahana ka seo.
He loved the outdoors.	O ne a rata ka ntle.
They take care of him.	Ba mo hlokomela.
We really needed the money.	Re ne re hlile re hloka chelete.
They treat you very well.	Ba u tšoara hantle haholo.
This is nothing.	Sena ha se letho.
And they want me to be with them.	Mme ba batla hore ke be le bona.
I will not say anything about my second wife.	Ha ke na ho bua letho ka mosali oa ka oa bobeli.
She was just so good.	O bile hantle haholo feela.
That was the first thing he noticed.	Ke ntho ea pele eo a ileng a e hlokomela.
We have to find these people before they know we want them.	Re tlameha ho fumana batho bana pele ba tseba hore re ba batla.
That seemed helpful.	Seo se ne se bonahala se thusa.
Let's say no one has ever seen him.	A re re ha ho motho ea kileng a mo bona.
They can defeat us.	Ba ka re hlola.
He told me he was in his room.	O ile a mpolella hore o ka kamoreng ea hae.
That line of yours is useless.	Mohala oo oa hau ha o na thuso.
But one cannot be sure of things.	Empa motho a ke ke a ba le bonnete ba lintho.
And then sleep.	'Me joale ho robala.
There was a bad mistake.	Ho ne ho e-na le phoso e mpe.
However it will be too late.	Leha ho le joalo e tla be e le morao haholo.
This is very good.	Sena se setle haholo.
I think there is something wrong.	Ke nahana hore ho na le phoso.
You have to meet him there.	U tlameha ho kopana le eena moo.
I wondered if they always thought of me.	Ke ne ke ipotsa hore na ebe nako le nako ba ne ba nahana ka ’na.
It has been difficult.	Ho bile thata.
I had no group.	Ke ne ke se na sehlopha.
I thought it was very good.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e ntle haholo.
By that, he is the son of the family.	Ka seo, ke mora oa lelapa.
And there is nothing wrong with that.	'Me ha ho letho le phoso ka sena.
That is the situation.	Ke boemo boo.
It was not that kind.	E ne e se mofuta oo.
We hope this helps!	Rea tšepa hore sena se thusa!
Yes, they are here.	E, ba teng mona.
But it is worth a look.	Empa ho bohlokoa ho sheba.
I am here now to help you beyond this.	Ke mona hona joale ho u thusa ho feta sena.
He did it in high school.	O e entse sekolong se phahameng.
So you try to get there and it is very difficult.	Kahoo u leka ho fihla moo 'me ho thata haholo.
This is just our time.	Ena ke nako ea rona feela.
All we can do now is wait.	Seo re ka se etsang hona joale ke ho ema.
I didn't say much.	Ha kea bua haholo.
It is not often the case.	Ha se hangata ho bang joalo.
I don't know why he got there.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ile a fihla moo.
That was difficult.	Seo se ne se le thata.
There was no room for error.	Ho ne ho se sebaka sa phoso.
When he arrived.	Ha a fihla.
Before they do.	Pele ba etsa joalo.
But it was too late.	Empa e ne e se e le morao haholo.
However, the books went with him.	Leha ho le joalo, libuka tseo li ne li tsamaea le eena.
But there was no one around, it seemed.	Empa ho ne ho se motho haufi, ho ne ho bonahala eka.
I would like to thank someone for doing this.	Ke rata ho leboha motho ea itseng ka ho etsa sena.
It works amazingly well.	E sebetsa ka tsela e makatsang.
Where? ' 	Hokae?'
he asked.	a botsa.
Write the question down.	Ngola potso fatše.
I really don't like to do it.	Ha e le hantle ha ke rate ho e etsa.
I only take it at night.	Ke e nka bosiu feela.
But here it goes.	Empa mona ho ea.
This was harder for him than you can imagine.	Sena se ne se le thata ho eena ho feta kamoo u ka nahanang kateng.
It can be painful to work with them.	E ka ba bohloko ho sebetsa le bona.
I could not see anyone coming to me.	Ke ne ke sa bone motho a tla ho 'na.
He said he would visit again next week.	O itse o tla etela hape bekeng e tlang.
It could be better.	Ho ka ba betere.
You can understand after reading.	U ka utloisisa ka mor'a ho bala.
Yes, she will be fine.	E, o tla phela hantle.
That's exactly right.	Ke 'nete ea eona eo.
But in reality, this is not the case.	Empa ha e le hantle, sena ha se joalo.
We still have to do that.	Re sa tlameha ho etsa joalo.
Either way you want to play this.	Joalo ka tsela efe kapa efe u batla ho bapala sena.
There were many.	Ho ne ho bile le tse ngata.
It will come out.	E tla tsoa.
Usually, both.	Hangata, ka bobeli.
Never forget them.	U se ke ua ba lebala le ka mohla.
You want to see them.	U batla ho ba bona.
Besides, it was too late.	Ntle ho moo, e ne e se e le morao haholo.
I need money.	Ke hloka chelete.
He agreed, and we quickly got dressed.	O ile a lumela, ’me ra apara kapele.
You will make friends.	U tla etsa metsoalle.
Yes, it can.	E, ho ka ba joalo.
Well, that's the time again.	Be, ke nako eo hape.
But try before you buy.	Empa leka pele u reka.
I did not think about it very hard.	Ha kea ka ka nahana ka eona ka thata haholo.
I don’t think it can be that hard.	Ha ke nahane hore ho ka ba thata hakaalo.
But we can do what we love.	Empa re khona ho etsa seo re se ratang.
It will look clear.	E tla bonahala e hlakile.
He really wanted this job.	O ne a hlile a batla mosebetsi ona.
They are really hard to predict.	Ba hlile ba thata ho bolela esale pele.
Not that day.	Ha se letsatsi leo.
Then why do you keep asking.	Joale ke hobane'ng ha u tsoela pele ho botsa.
Still, he was always busy.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a lula a phathahane.
I don't know what to think.	Ha ke tsebe seo nka se nahanang.
When will they arrive?	Ba tla fihla neng?
I don't have time for everyone.	Ha ke na nako ea motho e mong le e mong.
This was the best food we ever ate.	Ena e ne e le lijo tse monate ka ho fetisisa tseo re kileng ra li ja.
However, he was not harmed.	Leha ho le joalo, ha aa ka a tsoa kotsi.
I am close to their family.	Ke haufi le lelapa la bona.
Such an amazing child.	Ngoana ea makatsang joalo.
I need to keep my energy.	Ke hloka ho boloka matla a ka.
I am a mother in me.	Ke mme ka ho nna.
That was my point.	Eo e ne e le taba ea ka.
It's so nice to see you all.	Ho monate haholo ho le bona kaofela.
I became very good friends with everyone there.	Ke ile ka ba metsoalle e molemo haholo le motho e mong le e mong moo.
He worked very hard.	O ne a sebetsa ka thata haholo.
I know more.	Ke tseba ho feta.
To him it was his job.	Ho eena e ne e le mosebetsi oa hae.
You can get one.	U ka fumana e 'ngoe.
The same is true of humans.	Ho joalo le ka batho.
So, it just goes to show, you don't know.	Kahoo, e ea bonahala feela, ha o tsebe.
Local	Ea sebakeng seo
We gave them everything.	Re ile ra ba fa tsohle.
She wanted to go home and cry.	O ne a batla ho khutlela hae ho ea lla.
Do you see mine?	O ntse o bona tsa ka?.
The man and his dog, trying to understand it.	Monna le ntja ea hae, ba leka ho e utloisisa.
Now she doesn't want it at all.	Hona joale ha a sa e batla ho hang.
Some are hard to find.	Tse ling li thata ho li fumana.
We have others.	Re na le ba bang.
Things happen very quickly.	Lintho li etsahala kapele haholo.
There was an error.	Ho bile le phoso.
Sometimes it seems to be more than just another type.	Ka linako tse ling ho bonahala e le tse ngata ho feta tsa mofuta o mong.
It was not my idea.	E ne e se mohopolo wa ka.
You have to help the team.	U tlameha ho thusa sehlopha.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
But he kept coming back.	Empa o ne a lula a khutlela morao.
We did not go before us.	Ha rea ​​ka ra ea pele ho rona.
Then one thing.	Joale ntho e le 'ngoe.
With food.	Ka lijo.
She did not want to be her mother and father.	O ne a sa batle ho ba 'mè oa hae le ntate oa hae.
He watched as his friends left.	O ile a shebella ha metsoalle ea hae e tsamaea.
And it can still be.	Mme ho ntse ho ka ba jwalo.
You know what you want !.	Ua tseba hore ua batla!.
All we have to do is work well together.	Seo re lokelang ho se etsa feela ke ho sebetsa hammoho hantle.
Where could she go?	O ne a ka ea hokae?
He loved to drive his car.	O ne a rata ho khanna koloi ea hae.
They still do not know who you are.	Ha ba e-so tsebe hore na u mang.
It takes such time.	Ho nka nako e joalo.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka etsa sena joang.
But it was really coming out.	Empa e ne e hlile e tsoa.
They have seen it too.	Le bona ba e bone.
My legs looked good.	Maoto a ka a ne a bonahala hantle.
I did not know what to expect.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na nka lebella eng.
Then again, we learned that this is not the case.	Joale hape, re ile ra ithuta hore ha ho joalo.
Say what he wants you to say.	Ho bua seo e batlang hore o se bue.
Don't even ask.	U se ke ua ba ua botsa.
He studied carefully, and then he spoke.	O ile a ithuta ka hloko, eaba oa bua.
I see more of this than you do.	Ke bona tse ngata ho sena ho feta uena.
Hope to see you old man again soon.	Ke tšepa ho u bona motho oa khale hape haufinyane.
Think of it this way.	Nahana ka tsela ena.
That this method is the only way we can know.	Hore mokhoa ona ke eona feela tsela eo re ka e tsebang.
Or to be anywhere.	Kapa ho ba kae kapa kae.
We survived.	Re ile ra tsoela pele ho phela.
Surprisingly, this is both good news and bad news.	Ho makatsang ke hore tsena ke litaba tse monate le tse mpe.
And there is no chance of going anywhere.	'Me ha ho monyetla oa ho ea kae kapa kae.
What he would probably do.	Seo mohlomong a neng a tla se etsa.
They must be regular people.	E tlameha ebe ke batho ba kamehla.
But there was nothing you could do.	Empa ho ne ho se letho leo u ka le etsang.
Play for real money.	Bapala ka chelete ea 'nete.
It is as one might expect.	Ho joalo ka ha motho a ne a ka lebella.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
You have a good idea, it will come in handy.	O na le mohopolo o motle, o tla tla hantle.
It was his whole life.	E ne e le oa hae bophelo bohle.
Then you can go.	Joale u ka tsamaea.
There are many of them.	Ho na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
He had already heard the bad news.	O ne a se a utloile litaba tse mpe.
Help is available.	Thuso e teng.
He certainly has not said it.	Ka sebele ha a e-s’o e bue.
We do not know.	Ha re e-so tsebe.
He was a player of some sort.	E ne e le sebapali sa mofuta o itseng.
And we have nothing to do.	Mme ha re na seo re ka se etsang.
It should not work in my opinion.	Ha ea lokela ho sebetsa ka maikutlo a ka.
If we go, fine.	Haeba re tsamaea, hantle.
It was my father's mother's name.	E ne e le lebitso la 'Mè oa Ntate.
Or use his picture.	Kapa sebelisa setšoantšo sa hae.
He was a tough kid.	E ne e le ngoana ea thata.
That will have to stop.	Seo se tla tlameha ho ema.
It is a very, very good book.	Ke buka e ntle haholo, haholo.
It would help him to think clearly.	E ne e tla mo thusa ho nahana hantle.
It was supposed to be a good night.	E ne e lokela ho ba bosiu bo monate.
We found you.	Re u fumane.
So tell your friends.	Kahoo, bolella metsoalle ea hau.
So we found him.	Kahoo re ile ra mo fumana.
For some people this is very easy, for others it is very difficult.	Ho batho ba bang sena se bonolo haholo, ho ba bang se thata haholo.
It may seem a bit trivial.	E ka 'na ea bonahala e se ea bohlokoa hakaalo.
I would say.	Nka bolela.
He knew what he wanted.	O ne a tseba seo a se batlang.
He kept coming.	A nna a tla.
You don't see other people.	Ha o bone batho ba bang.
We can help people in need.	Re ka thusa batho ba hlokang thuso.
I do not know where he got the money.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o nkile chelete hokae.
We need to do this now.	Re lokela ho etsa sena jwale.
He was good.	O ne a le molemo.
You want to memorize everything.	U batla ho utloisisa ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe ka hlooho.
I like to do things.	Ke rata ho etsa lintho.
I've heard a lot of good things about it.	Ke utloile lintho tse ngata tse monate ka eona.
Maybe he knew it too.	Mohlomong le eena o ne a e tseba.
It's your job, too.	Ke mosebetsi wa hao, le wena.
All of this is reflected in his style.	Sena sohle se bonahala ka mokhoa oa hae.
And they would know us.	Mme ba ne ba tla re tseba.
To what he was before.	Ho seo a neng a le sona pele.
Rather, they point to a state of forgetfulness.	Ho e-na le hoo, li bua ka boemo ba ho lebala.
This does the job well.	Sena se etsa mosebetsi hantle.
Maybe that was true.	Mohlomong seo e ne e le ’nete.
One man walked away when police asked.	Monna e mong o ile a tsamaea ha mapolesa a botsa.
He knew the place.	O ne a tseba sebaka seo.
This is my job, to make this easy enough for anyone to do.	Ona ke mosebetsi oa ka, ho etsa hore sena se be bonolo hoo mang kapa mang a ka se etsang.
Once he gets to that, that's it.	Hang ha a fihla ho seo, ke seo.
No one can do it all.	Ha ho motho ya ka etsang tsohle.
Talk to you.	Bua le uena.
I had fun today.	Ke bile monate kajeno.
Now, it's up to you.	Jwale, ho ho wena.
I hope you find it useful.	Kea tšepa u tla e fumana e le molemo.
Of course you never did.	Ehlile ha o eso ho etse jwalo.
Finally the baby came in.	Qetellong ngoana a kena.
All equally important.	Tsohle tsa bohlokoa ka ho lekana.
It's just beautiful.	E ntle feela.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
And do not do this again.	Mme o seke wa hlola o etsa sena hape.
This works amazingly well.	Sena se sebetsa ka tsela e makatsang.
Why not, he said.	Hobaneng ho se joalo, o ile a re.
Last time.	Lekhetlo la ho qetela.
Know this life.	Tseba bophelo bona.
It's delicious.	Ho monate monate.
None of them knew what to do.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa bona ea neng a tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
There is something there now.	Ho na le ntho e teng moo jwale.
Because you love to learn.	Hobane u rata ho ithuta.
It's not a phone line nearby.	Ha se le mohala o haufi.
She heard the doctor speak.	O ile a utloa ngaka e bua.
We want to hear from you.	Re batla ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
It happens more than you want to know.	E etsahala ho feta kamoo o batlang ho tseba.
It seemed to be longer.	E ne e bonahala e le telele ho feta.
He said they would do so.	O itse ba tla etsa joalo.
And their weight.	Le boima ba tsona.
However, you are not sure if that is the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha u na bonnete ba hore na ke lebaka leo.
Just think if you need to.	Nahana feela haeba u hloka.
I read that.	Ke ile ka bala seo.
But he said they are not.	Empa o itse ha ba joalo.
He wants to go back home.	O batla ho khutlela hae.
Indeed, feelings of danger are just one of them.	Ka sebele, maikutlo a kotsi ke e 'ngoe ea tsona.
I could not drink it.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho e noa.
Whatever it does.	Eng kapa eng eo e e etsang.
There is no such product.	Ha ho tlhahiso e joalo.
Well for me.	Hantle bakeng sa ka.
In fact, sometimes it's just one guy.	Ha e le hantle, ka nako e 'ngoe ke mohlankana a le mong feela.
We are just getting started.	Re sa qala.
She would believe the truth in him, too.	O ne a tla lumela 'nete ho eena, le eena.
When you look good, you will feel better.	Ha u shebahala hantle, u tla ikutloa u le betere.
We eat, we drink, and sometimes we even talk.	Rea ja, rea noa, ’me ka linako tse ling, re bile re bua.
He would never forget it.	O ne a ke ke a e lebala.
Take advantage of them.	Sebelisa monyetla oa tsona.
There has to be a better way to find out where they are.	Ho tlameha ho be le mokhoa o betere oa ho fumana moo ba leng teng.
He says he has a good idea.	O re o na le mohopolo o motle.
He was not.	O ne a se joalo.
We can't stay here.	Re ke ke ra lula mona.
So much for your dad’s picture.	Haholo ka setšoantšo sa ntate oa hau.
And take one day at a time.	'Me u nke letsatsi le le leng ka nako.
And you think.	'Me u nahana.
I really don't want to.	Ha ke hlile ha ke batle.
I counted the money carefully.	Ke ile ka bala chelete ka hloko.
I really enjoy things.	Ke thabela lintho haholo.
I sat down, and he stood up.	Ka dula, a ema.
I read it when it was new.	Ke ile ka e bala ha e sa le ncha.
The children too.	Bana le bona le bona.
Or me on that.	Kapa 'na ka taba eo.
Things will find us.	Lintho li tla re fumana.
Good job on that.	Mosebetsi o motle ka seo.
But we can hear it going on.	Empa re ka e utloa e ntse e tsoela pele.
We do not know what they want.	Ha re tsebe seo ba se batlang.
That would not have happened.	Seo se ka be se sa etsahala.
And there is someone else in the room.	Mme ho na le motho e mong ka phaposing.
We learned from it.	Re ile ra ithuta ho eona.
I picked it up quickly.	Ke ile ka e nka kapele.
Everyone finds their way.	E mong le e mong o fumana tsela ya hae.
She was beautiful, she thought.	O ne a le motle, a nahana.
The party was in full swing, though it was already late in the evening.	Mokete o ne o ntse o tsoela pele ka matla, le hoja e ne e se e le mantsiboea.
That's about it though.	Ke ka eona leha ho le joalo.
We will take anyone.	Re tla nka mang kapa mang.
Maybe I don't have it right.	Mohlomong ha ke na eona hantle.
Somehow he always does that.	Ka tsela e itseng kamehla o etsa seo.
I still love this band.	Ke ntse ke rata sehlopha sena.
If it works.	Haeba e sebetsa.
We want to help them stay healthy and healthy.	Re batla ho ba thusa ho phela hantle le ho phela hantle.
It was a very good book.	E ne e le buka e ntle haholo.
The police will ask questions.	Mapolesa a tla botsa lipotso.
I know it's good here.	Kea tseba hore e ntle mona.
However, it was only once.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le lekhetlo le le leng feela.
He was coming.	O ne a e tla.
It takes time, but it is better.	Ho nka nako, empa ho molemo.
This was all his fault.	Ena e ne e le molato oa hae kaofela.
You did not know when that would come.	O ne o sa tsebe hore na e tla fihla neng.
How to try to find out?	Joang ho leka ho tseba?
I usually arrive after dinner.	Hangata ke fihla ka mor’a lijo tsa mantsiboea.
That is clear.	Seo se hlakile.
But that is not what I do.	Empa seo ha se seo ke se etsang.
Do this now!	Etsa sena hona joale!
I wanted to see what you looked like.	Ke ne ke batla ho bona hore na u shebahala joang.
It was the same with everyone else.	Ho bile joalo le ka bohle.
He was even not sure if he wanted to keep his name.	O ne a bile a se na bonnete ba hore o batla ho boloka lebitso la hae.
I did not get it all.	Ha kea ka ka e fumana kaofela.
He felt that he could not live without them.	O ne a ikutloa hore a ke ke a phela ntle le bona.
I knew how much you wanted something like that.	Ke ne ke tseba hore na u batla ntho e joalo hakae.
We have to go through it.	Re tlameha ho feta ho eona.
This road is dangerous at night.	Tsela ena e kotsi bosiu.
Because now you realize that it is not bad.	Hobane joale ua hlokomela hore ha ho mpe.
We wish to speak with you.	Re lakatsa ho bua le uena.
Anything my team needs me to do.	Eng kapa eng eo sehlopha sa ka se hlokang hore ke se etse.
I believed it would be so.	Ke ne ke lumela hore ho tla ba joalo.
You are the one with power now.	Ke uena ea nang le matla joale.
Nice place.	Sebaka se setle.
With us.	Le rona.
It is useless to try to talk to him.	Ha ho na thuso ho leka ho bua le eena.
The same is true of our children.	Ho joalo le ka bana ba rona.
And she is better.	Mme o betere.
However, it would not happen.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e ke ke ea etsahala.
It was the same with people.	Ho ne ho le joalo le ka batho.
Neither did my parents.	Le batsoali ba ka ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
It had just happened to him.	E ne e sa tsoa etsahala ho eena.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha u joalo.
No one was talking to anyone.	Ho ne ho se motho ya buang le e mong.
It was going backwards.	Ho ne ho se ho khutlela morao.
The children were happy in the back of the room.	Bana ba ne ba thabile ka mor'a kamore.
We need to talk.	Re hloka ho bua.
There was no one at home.	Ho ne ho se motho hae.
This can be more than just talk.	Sena se ka feta ho bua feela.
We made good progress.	Re ile ra tsoela pele hantle.
I do not want to do this every time.	Ha ke batle ho etsa sena nako le nako.
I wish you could have met him.	Ke lakatsa eka u ka be u kopane le eena.
And you could always stay here.	'Me u ne u ka lula mona kamehla.
House party, if you like.	Mokete oa ntlo, haeba u rata.
This can be a problem.	Sena e ka ba bothata.
It is nothing new.	Ha se ntho e ncha.
It tells them something.	E ba bolella ho hong.
Whatever he did.	Eng kapa eng eo a e entseng.
I don't have much time.	Ha ke na nako e telele.
They really liked to go fast.	Ba ne ba hlile ba rata ho tsamaea kapele.
Of course it was not.	Ehlile ho ne ho se jwalo.
His condition was absent.	Boemo ba hae bo ne bo le sieo.
He had done this before, of course.	O ne a kile a etsa sena pele, ehlile.
It was easy to find.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho e fumana.
We will see.	Re tla bona.
But this is easy to understand.	Empa sena se bonolo ho utloisisa.
I might have to try that.	Nka tlameha ho leka seo.
I told her my thoughts.	Ke ile ka mo bolella maikutlo a ka.
We will start again.	Re tla qala hape.
He would preach it.	O ne a tla e rera.
This will help the problem.	Sena se tla thusa bothata.
If anything it would make it even more important.	Haeba ntho leha e le efe e ne e tla etsa hore e be ea bohlokoa le ho feta.
How close we are to being absent today.	Re se re le haufi hakae le ho se be teng kajeno.
I need her more than ever before.	Ke mo hloka ho feta leha e le neng pele hona joale.
The place was difficult.	Sebaka seo se ne se le thata.
He did not want to ask.	O ne a sa batle ho botsa.
And this happens whether you like it or not.	Mme sena se etsahala o rata kapa o sa rate.
That would be fun.	Hoo ho ka ba monate.
He was done with that.	O ne a qetile ka seo.
They can hear it.	Ba khona ho e utloa.
It's hard to find him.	Ho thata ho mo fumana.
So after dinner go to bed.	Kahoo ka mor'a lijo tsa mantsiboea ho robala.
They understand the problem.	Ba utloisisa bothata.
I'm trying to live in the present.	Ke leka ho phela nakong ea joale.
He wished he could be somewhere else.	O ne a lakatsa eka a ka be a le sebakeng se seng.
Time has done that.	Nako e entse seo.
They could go.	Ba ne ba ka tsamaea.
All you have to do is go there.	Seo u hlokang ho se etsa feela ke ho ea moo.
And so it happened.	Mme ha etsahala jwalo.
So he lived nearby.	Kahoo o ne a lula haufi.
Maybe it was nothing.	Mohlomong e ne e se letho.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka eona.
Everyone does that.	E mong le e mong o etsa jwalo.
It was not his place to do anything.	E ne e se sebaka sa hae ho etsa letho.
It's not your job.	Ha se mosebetsi wa hao.
Everyone was there.	Bohle ba ne ba le teng.
He was needed.	O ne a hlokahala.
He does not want money.	Ha a batle chelete.
In your opinion.	Ka maikutlo a hau.
They need a lot of help.	Ba hloka thuso e ngata haholo.
Get out of.	Tsoa ho.
It’s time to pay.	Ke nako ea ho lefa.
Being outside was difficult.	Ho ba ka ntle ho ne ho le boima.
So think, and do.	Kahoo nahana, 'me u etse.
He would make a good man.	O ne a tla etsa monna e motle.
They are both happy.	Ka bobeli ba thabile.
I was doing well.	Ke ne ke sebetsa hantle.
To take care of her.	Bakeng sa ho mo hlokomela.
I’m not sure we should try to have another baby so soon.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore re lokela ho leka ho ba le ngoana e mong kapele hakana.
Who comes first?	Ke mang ea tlang pele?
The girl loves the girl.	Ngoanana o rata ngoanana.
So, it may be.	Ka hona, ho ka 'na ha e-ba joalo.
How to achieve this ?.	Joang ho fihlela see?.
I just wanted to know where he was.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho tseba hore na o hokae.
Life is as good as it can be.	Bophelo bo monate ka moo bo ka bang teng.
This room is empty.	Kamore ena e se na letho.
Every day of this festival is a day of life.	Letsatsi le leng le le leng la mokete ona ke letsatsi la bophelo.
I want to cry.	Ke batla ho lla.
He looked like he was waiting for something.	O ne a shebahala eka o emetse ho hong.
He arrived after everyone had left.	O ile a fihla ka mor'a hore bohle ba tsamaee.
But this time we could not trust him.	Empa ka nako ena re ne re ke ke ra mo tšepa.
However, the food was really good.	Leha ho le joalo, lijo li ne li hlile li le molemo.
I'm talking about it here.	Ke bua ka eona ka mona.
Then we are sure to meet again soon.	Ka mor'a moo re na le bonnete ba hore re tla kopana hape pele ho nako e telele.
I'm not alive.	Ha kea phela.
He wanted to have them all.	O ne a batla hore a be le tsona kaofela.
It's really beautiful.	E ntle ruri.
Assume the latter holds.	Nka hore ea morao e tšoara.
To start everything again, he thought.	Ho qala ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe hape, o ile a nahana.
That was on time.	Eo e ne e le ka nako.
I made my decision.	Ke entse qeto ea ka.
So were you.	Le uena u ne u le joalo.
No, that is not the case today.	Che, ha ho joalo kajeno.
That's nice stuff there, baby.	Ke ntho tse monate moo, ngoana.
We had just returned from work.	Re ne re sa tsoa khutla mosebetsing.
News plays on them.	Litaba li bapala ho bona.
You will too.	Le uena u tla etsa joalo.
At times, a mistake may be the best thing that can happen to you.	Ka linako tse ling, phoso e ka 'na ea e-ba ntho e molemo ka ho fetisisa ho etsahala.
It can't fix these things.	Ha e khone ho lokisa lintho tsena.
He never spoke to me again but to himself.	Ha aa ka a hlola a bua le 'na empa a bua a le mong.
I did not want to continue.	Ke ne ke se ke sa batle ho tsoela pele.
The baby is crying.	Ngoana eo oa lla.
Spend a lot of time with people.	Qeta nako e ngata le batho.
It really was nothing.	Ruri e ne e se letho.
She wanted to talk to the boy.	O ne a batla hore a bue le moshanyana eo.
You want to get to it first.	U batla ho fihla ho eona pele.
I can't say.	Ha ke khone ho bolela.
Everything is a thought.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ke mohopolo.
I did not return to the group.	Ha kea ka ka khutlela sehlopheng.
I think this is the way to go.	Ke nahana hore ena ke tsela ea ho tsamaea.
Its work is hard.	Mosebetsi oa eona o boima.
I do this for fun and learning.	Ke etsa sena bakeng sa monate le ho ithuta.
This place is always an "illegal" place.	Sebaka sena se lula e le sebaka se "se nang molao".
He tried hard.	O ile a leka ka matla.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke na bonnete.
He could not afford to buy books.	O ne a ke ke a khona ho reka libuka.
I need your help.	Ke hloka thuso ea hau.
Room space.	Sebaka sa kamore.
It is not a good thing to learn.	Ha se ntho e ntle ho ithuta.
It seemed to be the only one.	E ne e bonahala e le 'ngoe feela.
It is better to feel something than nothing.	Ho molemo ho ikutloa ho hong ho feta ho se letho.
However, they may not be.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ka 'na ba se ke ba.
He was the only person who believed in him.	E ne e le eena feela motho ea neng a lumela ho eena.
This car is more important than the last one.	Koloi ena e bohlokoa ho feta ea ho qetela.
Let them take another one.	Ba ke ba nts'e e mong.
That was my problem.	Eo e ne e le bothata ba ka.
I know these people.	Ke tseba batho bana.
He had nothing.	O ne a sena letho.
Someone was coming.	Ho ne ho tla tla motho.
I will buy to see them again.	Ke tla reka ho bona hape.
And have another one.	'Me u be le e' ngoe.
He refused to eat anything.	O ile a hana ho ja letho le leng.
He said nothing.	Ha a ka a bua letho ka letho.
we will do the same.	le rona re tla etsa joalo.
There is another girl.	Ho na le ngoanana e mong.
And you, and you.	Le uena, le uena.
Or is there another way to fix this?	Kapa na ho na le tsela e 'ngoe ea ho lokisa see?
And it still works.	'Me e ntse e sebetsa.
This issue is important.	Taba ena e bohlokoa.
You will find it much easier to learn.	U tla fumana ho le bonolo haholo ho ithuta.
It's very simple, of course, I just have to do it.	Ho bonolo haholo, ha e le hantle, ke tlameha feela ho e etsa.
So you get this.	Kahoo o fumana sena.
I need to see it come back.	Ke hloka ho e bona e khutla.
I hope you had a great time.	Kea tšepa u bile le nako e monate.
I looked at it again.	Ka e sheba hape.
This has often been difficult.	Hangata sena se bile thata.
Some are harder to find than others.	Tse ling li thata ho li fumana ho feta tse ling.
That's what he is.	Ke seo a leng sona.
It can still be the first.	E ntse e ka ba oa pele.
We really enjoyed our stay.	Re ile ra thabela ho lula ha rōna haholo.
But he was too tired to continue.	Empa o ne a khathetse haholo hore a ka tsoela pele.
I mean something that is also a concept.	Ke bolela ntho eo hape e leng mohopolo.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
However, this is nothing new.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se ntho e ncha.
He still loves it.	O ntse a o rata.
But this is not the way to go.	Empa ena ha se tsela ea ho tsamaea.
I should not cry.	Ha kea lokela ho lla.
They are powerful.	Ba matla.
It was a family affair.	E ne e le taba ea lelapa.
You know this.	U tseba sena.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mohlomong ke ntho e ntle.
That is not what we are.	Ha se seo re leng sona.
And he can.	'Me a ka khona.
Thanks for reading.	Ke leboha ho bala.
It was no other.	E ne e se e mong.
Indeed, this is the only thing that happened.	Ka sebele, sena ke sona feela se ileng sa etsahala.
He always finished his homework.	Kamehla o ne a qeta mosebetsi oa hae oa sekolo.
He gives her everything she wants.	O mo fa sohle seo a se batlang.
Her head started to cry.	Hlooho ea hae e ile ea qala ho lla.
Well, since he had both of them in any form.	Hantle, ho tloha ha a ne a e-na le tsona ka bobeli ka mokhoa ofe kapa ofe.
My head was clear again.	Hlooho ea ka e ne e hlakile hape.
It was there that the police found him and arrested him.	Ke hona moo mapolesa a ileng a mo fumana a ba a mo tšoara.
They would have to get to that.	Ba ne ba tla lokela ho fihla ho seo.
But it soon became apparent that it did not matter.	Empa ho e-s’o ee kae ho ne ho se na taba hakaalo.
We know our strengths.	Re tseba matla a rona.
It can be very difficult.	Ho ka ba thata haholo.
I did not plan it.	Ha kea e rera.
I think it’s important to enjoy what you have.	Ke nahana hore ho bohlokoa ho thabela seo u nang le sona.
But yes, if the idea.	Empa ee, haeba mohopolo.
Go eat it.	E ea o ja.
What should you not do?	Ke eng eo u sa lokelang ho e etsa?
The fact is, they did not believe him.	Taba ke hore ha baa ka ba mo lumela.
It will not mean.	Ha ho na ho bolela.
We were a family.	Re ne re le lelapa.
You have your place.	U na le sebaka sa hau.
It's not that kind of thing.	Ha se ntho ea mofuta oo.
It's the same thing.	Ke ntho e le 'ngoe.
That's when he can get past dangerous problems.	Ke ha a ka fumana mathata a fetileng a kotsi.
There was nothing he could do here.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang mona.
The atmosphere is pleasant.	Boemo bo monate bo monate.
I can do anything for you.	Nka u etsetsa eng kapa eng.
I really don't see that.	Ruri ha ke bone seo.
This whole issue is my imagination.	Taba ena kaofela ke mohopolo oa ka.
I really want to see him.	Ke hlile ke batla ho mo bona.
It was my first.	E ne e le ea ka ea pele.
It was not always easy to do this.	Hangata ho ne ho se bonolo ho etsa sena.
However, he could not.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa khone.
The children love their mother.	Bana ba rata 'mè oa bona.
He had to sleep somehow.	O ne a lokela ho robala ka tsela e itseng.
I saw it when I came in.	Ke e bone ha ke kena.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le monate ho bua 'nete.
You don't have to think.	Ha ua tlameha ho nahana.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
I find the same mistake.	Ke fumana phoso e tšoanang.
Because there is nothing.	Hobane haho letho.
A lot of mind.	Kelello e ngata.
Such a question is not appropriate.	Potso ea mofuta o joalo ha ea lokela.
And they did not.	Mme ha ba a ka ba etsa jwalo.
He seems to be buying time.	O bonahala a reka nako.
That man was bad news.	Monna eo e ne e le litaba tse mpe.
He said he knew the matter well.	A re o ne a tseba taba eo hantle.
That could be any of us.	Eo e ka ba mang kapa mang oa rona.
That's him.	Ke eena.
I really like it.	Ke e rata haholo.
I beg you to do so.	Ke le kopa ho etsa joalo.
We were very close.	Re ne re le haufi haholo.
It would seem like he had ever played.	Ho ne ho tla bonahala eka o kile a bapala.
Talk about it.	Ba bue ka eona.
Start where the person is.	Qala moo motho a leng teng.
If it doesn't, it's a bad book.	Ha e sa etse joalo, ke buka e mpe.
It doesn't make sense.	Ha ho kelello.
Something was going to come back.	Ntho e 'ngoe e ne e se na ho khutla.
But they know it.	Empa ba a e tseba.
It worked very well.	E ile ea sebetsa hantle haholo.
It had no other advantage.	E ne e se na molemo o mong.
We really enjoyed our meal.	Re ile ra thabela lijo tsa rōna haholo.
Do your homework.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau.
Of course, they are.	Ehlile, ba joalo.
However, they too did not help him.	Leha ho le joalo, le bona ha baa ka ba mo thusa.
Easy to work with.	Ho ba bonolo ho sebetsa le.
He is a strange man.	Ke motho ea makatsang.
It usually takes a while to get it ready.	Hangata ho nka nako ho e lokisa hantle.
I don't care what it is.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na ke eng.
There is something here.	Ho na le ho hong mona.
You have had it.	U bile le eona.
He wanted her to leave.	O ne a batla hore a tsamaee.
He must be injured.	O tlameha ho tsoa kotsi.
It did not take long.	Ha ea ka ea nka nako e telele.
Maybe he was just waiting for someone.	Mohlomong o ne a emetse motho feela.
There is no tomorrow here.	Haho hosane mona.
She did not know what to expect.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a ka lebella eng.
I want to go back.	Ke batla ho khutla.
I will give it to them now.	Ke tla ba fa hona joale.
There was someone else in the room.	Ho ne ho e-na le motho e mong ka kamoreng.
So you can't do that.	Kahoo u ke ke ua etsa joalo.
I told you so.	Ke o boleletse jwalo.
What did you do? 	U entseng?
It was clear he had told her something.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore o mo boleletse ho hong.
he asks.	oa botsa.
No, that did not matter.	Che, hoo ho ne ho se na thuso.
Of course, I'm the only one speaking.	Ehlile, ke 'na feela ea buang.
It can be very simple.	E ka ba bonolo haholo.
But none of these are enough.	Empa ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona e lekaneng.
Yet they continue.	Leha ho le joalo ba tsoela pele.
It makes it a lot easier that way.	E etsa hore ho be bonolo haholo ka tsela eo.
He had to have trouble sleeping.	O ne a lokela ho ba le bothata ba ho robala.
But my legs hurt.	Empa maoto a ka a bohloko.
Very well.	Hantle haholo.
You may have been here before.	Mohlomong u kile ua fihla mona.
In the end, that is exactly what happened.	Qetellong, ke sona se etsahetseng hantle.
There was no one else here.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong mona.
Without enough money, the school cannot	Ntle le chelete e lekaneng, sekolo ha se khone
He works very hard.	O sebetsa ka thata haholo.
However, that dog was never a dog.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho mohla ntja eo e kileng ea e-ba ntja.
It doesn't matter anymore.	Ha ho sa na taba.
Do a good job.	Etsa mosebetsi o motle.
He did not know where.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na hokae.
Mom and Dad were so much fun.	Mme le ntate ba bile monate haholo.
And that is what you wanted too.	Mme ke seo o neng o se batla le wena.
He loved to talk a lot.	O ne a rata ho bua haholo.
We should not start drinking so quickly.	Ha rea ​​​​lokela ho qala ho noa kapele hakana.
Too many people drink too much.	Batho ba bangata haholo ba noa haholo.
Get into that, now.	Kena ho seo, hona joale.
But that is another matter.	Empa eo ke taba e ’ngoe.
And they did.	Mme ba ile ba etsa jwalo.
You are with him.	U na le eena.
He never spoke again.	Ha a ka a hlola a bua.
Things you would not understand.	Lintho tseo u neng u ke ke ua li utloisisa.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
Yet it ultimately gives him what he needs.	Leha ho le joalo qetellong e mo fa seo a se hlokang.
I just wanted to have a good time with it.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba le nako e monate le eona.
Finally, you must meet that person.	Qetellong, u tlameha ho kopana le motho eo.
It can be a man, a woman or a child.	E ka ba monna, mosali kapa ngoana.
They are always in front.	Ba lula ba le ka pele.
That's what he said.	Ke seo a se buileng.
Something happened?	Ho na le ntho e etsahetseng?
Let's see how good you are!	A re bone hore na u molemo hakae!
I would have expected it.	Nka be ke e lebeletse.
Or hard.	Kapa e thata.
I am alive.	Kea phela.
Do what you do well.	Etsa seo u se etsang hantle.
I don't know what it is before time.	Ha ke tsebe ke ntho efe pele ho nako.
I started walking fast.	Ke ile ka qala ho tsamaea kapele.
There is no way to tell the truth.	Ha ho mokhoa oa ho bolela ka 'nete.
We all slept that night.	Kaofela re ile ra robala bosiung boo.
It does not exist.	Ha e eo.
And you, too.	Mme le wena, le wena.
But he doesn't care.	Empa ha a tsotelle seo.
The strange man went home.	Monna ea makatsang o ile a ea hae.
You must be learning by now.	E tlameha ebe oa ithuta hona joale.
You know you have it.	Ua tseba hore u na le eona.
I can't stand you people.	Ha ke khone ho ema le lona batho.
He probably would not have liked it.	Mohlomong o ne a ke ke a e rata.
There had to be something he could do.	Ho ne ho lokela hore ho be le seo a ka se etsang.
Get out and now people are taking care of you.	Tsoa 'me joale batho baa u hlokomela.
And real pain outside.	Le bohloko ba sebele ntle.
Finally, he stood up.	Qetellong, a ema.
Without pain.	Ntle le bohloko.
Now, you can use whatever you like.	Hona joale, u ka sebelisa seo u se ratang.
I have to have plenty of time.	Ke lokela ho ba le nako e ngata.
That can work.	Seo se ka sebetsa.
But we are still there.	Empa re ntse re le teng.
Just read, otherwise you go to bed.	Ho bala feela, ho seng jwalo o ya robala.
You do it.	Ua e etsa.
Finally, he spoke.	Qetellong, o ile a bua.
I learn a lot from her.	Ke ithuta lintho tse ngata ho eena.
Anyone who wanted could look at them.	Mang kapa mang ea batlang o ne a ka sheba ka tsona.
I know you feel my pain.	Kea tseba hore u utloa bohloko ba ka.
He had just come in.	O ne a sa tsoa kena.
One starts to work.	Motho o qala ho sebetsa.
I will find time for this.	Ke tla fumana nako ea sena.
It must be an opportunity to make money.	E tlameha ebe ke monyetla oa ho etsa chelete.
That should not be the case.	Taba eo ha ea lokela ho ba eona taba.
I could not fix it in time.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho e lokisa ka nako.
I didn't even want to see it.	Ke ne ke sa batle le ho e bona.
The water was delicious!	Metsi a ne a le monate!
You didn't do it.	U ne u sa e etse.
That really shouldn’t have happened, but they let it go anyway.	Seo se ne se hlile se sa lokela ho etsahala, empa ba ile ba se tlohela leha ho le joalo.
If you have an idea, go ahead.	Haeba u na le mohopolo, tsoela pele.
I used to do it for them.	Ke ne ke ba etsetsa sona.
So how are you doing?	Joale u tsamaea joang?
Come back now.	Khutla joale.
It was not easy to find her.	Ho ne ho se bonolo ho mo fumana.
I was there at the time.	Ke ne ke le teng ka nako eo.
This was his chance.	Ona e ne e le monyetla oa hae.
I certainly wouldn’t tell him how to play.	Ka sebele nke ke ka mo bolella mokhoa oa ho bapala.
He knew.	O ne a tseba.
Good time, yes.	Nako e monate, e.
I mean everyone loves her.	Ke bolela hore bohle ba a mo rata.
I am sure you will love this one.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o tla rata ena.
We hope you enjoy it.	Rea tšepa hore u ka e rata.
I could just see them alive.	Nka mpa ka ba bona ba phela.
But he did not know why.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha ho le joalo.
The same is true for you.	Ho joalo le ho uena.
They say it hurts.	Ba re ke bohloko.
We did just that.	Re ile ra etsa joalo.
Your children will have to take their chances.	Bana ba hau ba tla tlameha ho nka monyetla oa bona.
Which is how you know best.	E leng kamoo u tsebang hantle.
Life can be wonderful sometimes.	Bophelo bo ka ba monate ka linako tse ling.
I never went again.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke ea.
We work together from time to time.	Re sebetsa hammoho nako le nako.
Money or whatever.	Chelete kapa leha ho le joalo.
He is no longer a child.	Ha e sa le ngoana.
I like traveling.	Ke rata ho tsamaea.
I don't know what he does.	Ha ke tsebe seo a se etsang.
I want nothing more from you.	Ha ke sa batla letho ho wena.
We do a lot of other things, too.	Re etsa lintho tse ling tse ngata, hape.
The team took one day.	Sehlopha se ile sa nka letsatsi le le leng.
Someone had to help her.	Motho e mong o ile a tlameha ho mo thusa.
It's good for life.	E monate ka bophelo.
They say, try to do it together.	Ba re, leka ho e etsa hammoho.
It was easy to find.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho e fumana.
I really enjoyed learning.	Ke ne ke hlile ke rata ho ithuta.
I would love to work with you.	Ke rata ho sebetsa le uena.
Or father, for that matter.	Kapa ntate, bakeng sa taba eo.
Thank you all.	Ke leboha tsohle.
It is not at all easy to speak well.	Ha ho bonolo ho hang ho bua hantle.
I keep everything here.	Ke boloka tsohle ka mona.
I had just learned how to do it.	Ke ne ke sa tsoa ithuta mokhoa oa ho e etsa.
Now you look finished.	Joale u shebahala u qetile.
We could use him.	Re ne re ka mo sebelisa.
I'll get another one.	Ke tla fumana se seng.
So, go ahead.	Kahoo, tsoela pele.
Many parents do not go with their children.	Batsoali ba bangata ha ba tsamaee le bana ba bona.
They don't see it.	Ha ba e bone.
This, too, will pass.	Sena, le sona, se tla feta.
And you know that a strong man can be dangerous.	'Me oa tseba hore monna ea matla a ka ba kotsi.
If you drive carefully, you will get home.	Haeba u khanna ka hloko, u tla fihla hae.
I felt very happy.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke thabile haholo.
This is the first rule.	Ona ke molao oa pele.
It's simple.	E bonolo.
Of course, these do not exist anymore.	Ho hlakile hore tsena ha li sa le teng.
Don't care.	Se tsotelle.
He didn't care what he thought.	O ne a sa tsotelle seo a se nahanang.
He was trying to stop it.	O ne a ntse a leka ho e tlohela.
But there is one thing that everyone should know.	Empa ho na le ntho e le 'ngoe eo bohle ba lokelang ho e tseba.
In it.	Ho eona.
We learn from others.	Re ithuta ho ba bang.
He has always spoken loudly.	Haesale a bua ka matla.
However, things did not turn out that way.	Leha ho le joalo, lintho li ne li sa tsamaee hantle.
He was useless to be alone.	O ne a se na thuso ea ho ba mong.
He must have wanted you to know.	E tlameha ebe o ne a batla hore u tsebe.
He wanted to catch up.	O ne a batla ho tšoara.
You really want to see your hands.	Ehlile u batla ho bona matsoho a hau.
Because their lives are important.	Hobane bophelo ba bona ke ba bohlokoa.
Everything seemed to be the first time.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ile ea bonahala eka ke lekhetlo la pele.
I was really hurt.	Ke ne ke hlile ke utloile bohloko.
The group as soon as he arrived.	Sehlopha hang ha a fihla.
No, this was not a good idea.	Che, ona e ne e se mohopolo o motle.
But no.	Empa che.
Police at the time.	Mapolesa ka nako eo.
They leave.	Ba tsamaea.
Probably too much time, though.	Mohlomong nako e ngata haholo, leha ho le joalo.
None of us talked about our problems.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea ileng a bua ka mathata a rona.
I am and no one else.	Ke 'na 'me ha ho e mong.
Let it be so.	Ho be joalo.
He knew it was too easy.	O ne a tseba hore ho bile bonolo haholo.
Easy way to travel.	Mokhoa o bonolo oa ho tsamaea.
Except it's not exactly that, either.	Ntle le hore ha se hantle hantle, le hona.
The woman will always cry.	Mosali o tla lla kamehla.
I can't understand what he was thinking.	Ke sitoa ho utloisisa hore na o ne a nahana eng.
My type, or his type.	Mofuta wa ka, kapa mofuta wa hae.
I'm about to leave.	Ke se ke tla tsamaea.
But it hurts a lot, according to me.	Empa ho bohloko haholo, ho ya ka nna.
I'll be out soon.	Ke tla tsoa haufinyane.
That would be.	Seo e ne e tla ba .
However, this was difficult in practice.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se ne se le thata ha se sebetsa.
Near his home.	Haufi le hae.
He never looked again.	Ha a ka a hlola a sheba hape.
Now there was not much going on.	Joale ho ne ho se na lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang.
It looked good on him.	E ne e shebahala e le ntle ho eena.
I want to help children who want to be healthy.	Ke batla ho thusa bana ba batlang ho phela hantle.
He was clear on what he had to do.	O ne a hlakile ho seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
Then go ahead.	Ebe u ea ka pele.
We understood that he drank a lot.	Re ne re utloisisa hore o noa haholo.
So that we can see.	E le hore re ka bona.
You have to look for someone.	U tlameha ho batla motho.
It must.	E tlameha ho.
If you do, you will find something new.	Ha u etsa joalo, u tla fumana ntho e ncha.
They are friends and several with me.	Ke metsoalle le ba 'maloa le 'na.
He did not take her.	Ha a ka a mo nka.
‘The truth is that one feels that way.	’Nete ke hore motho o ikutloa ka tsela eo.
It doesn't really matter that much.	Ha e hlile ha e bohlokoa hakaalo.
Look at this book.	Sheba buka ena.
Tell us whether you took them or not.	U re bolelle hore na u li nkile kapa che.
But it can't be.	Empa ho ka se be jwalo.
I did not want to.	Ke ne ke sa batle.
So do one more, one more, one more.	Kahoo etsa e 'ngoe hape, e' ngoe hape, e 'ngoe hape.
And maybe to you it is nothing.	'Me mohlomong ho uena hase letho.
However, problems remain.	Leha ho le joalo, mathata a ntse a le teng.
He did not think of anything to say.	O ne a sa nahane letho leo a ka le buang.
It is not easy.	Ha ho bonolo.
Maybe he didn't know what it was.	Mohlomong o ne a sa tsebe hore na ke eng.
He should not stay.	Ha aa lokela ho lula.
Notice now.	Hlokomela jwale.
The latter was not.	Ea ho qetela e ne e se eona.
It could have been at the same time.	E ne e ka ba ka nako e tšoanang.
If someone came home it would give him time.	Haeba motho a ne a ka tla hae e ne e tla mo fa nako.
So it was not easy to find them.	Kahoo ho ne ho se bonolo hakaalo ho li fumana.
And just enough to be dangerous.	Le ho lekana feela ho ba kotsi.
And just, you know.	'Me feela, ua tseba.
Maybe there was his letter there.	Mohlomong ho ne ho e-na le lengolo la hae moo.
Start your day.	Qala letsatsi la hau.
Yet she would eat enough food, until she met another young man.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a tla ja lijo tse lekaneng, ho fihlela a kopana le mohlankana e mong.
Some of them are very good.	Tse ling tsa tsona li ntle haholo.
Things about you.	Lintho ka uena.
She is absolutely right.	O hantle ruri.
You are new to this.	U ncha ho sena.
His only job.	Mosebetsi oa hae feela.
And something else to do.	Le ho hloka ho hong ho ho etsa.
But no one did.	Empa ha ho motho ea ileng a etsa joalo.
They had.	Ba ne ba na le.
That is why we are here.	Ke ka lebaka leo re leng mona.
No, to be.	Che, ho ba.
He works very hard.	O sebetsa ka thata haholo.
It was not his hands, nor were his clothes.	E ne e se matsoho a hae, leha e le hore liaparo e ne e se tsa hae.
He refused it.	O ile a e hana.
He would be back here tomorrow.	O ne a tla khutlela mona hosane.
Would you please tell me the time, please?	O ka mpolella nako, ka kopo?
I told him there was no way.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore ha ho tsela.
The task before them was daunting.	Mosebetsi o ka pele ho bona o ne o le boima.
And this was not the worst.	Hape sena e ne e se sona se mpe ka ho fetisisa.
They are actually my house shoes.	Ha e le hantle ke lieta tsa ka tsa ntlo.
Nothing has happened since then.	Ha ho letho le etsahetseng ho tloha ka nako eo.
He says no one has ever asked him if he needs help.	O re ha ho motho ea kileng a mo botsa hore na o hloka thuso.
However, it is not very easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho bonolo haholo.
No one else can know your work.	Ha ho motho e mong ea ka tsebang mosebetsi oa hau.
You or anyone.	Wena kapa mang kapa mang.
We would not be able to do it without them.	Re ka be re sa khona ho e etsa ntle le bona.
The point is to finish.	Taba ke ho qeta.
But you have a lot of good money.	Empa u na le chelete e ngata e monate.
Everyone has their own truth.	E mong le e mong o na le 'nete ea hae.
I was glad to see her.	Ke ile ka thabela ho mo bona.
This was exactly what they needed.	Sena e ne e le sona seo ba neng ba se hloka.
They eat for a living.	Ba ja bakeng sa ho phela.
And all of it, like everyone else, works.	'Me kaofela ha eona, joalo ka motho e mong le e mong, ea sebetsa.
You could not do anything like that.	U ne u ke ke ua etsa letho la mofuta oo.
It is best to go to bed early.	Ho molemo ho robala kapele.
I'll tell you about it.	Ke tla u bolella ka eona.
You know where you want to go.	O tseba moo o batlang ho ya teng.
That you and he will stay here with us now.	Hore uena le eena le tla lula mona le rona hona joale.
She seems to be waiting for someone.	Ho bonahala a emetse motho.
However, there is good news to be had.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le litaba tse ntle tse lokelang ho ba teng.
I've seen it before.	Ke e bone pele.
I needed it.	Ke ne ke o hloka.
It's beautiful and you should watch it.	E ntle 'me u lokela ho e shebella.
No one knows what will happen next.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang se tla etsahala.
It was really easy.	E ne e hlile e le bonolo.
I think the reason is clear.	Ke nahana hore lebaka le hlakile.
And that they do.	Le hore ba etsa joalo.
We never met.	Ha rea ​​ka ra kopana le ho kopana.
Now, dad, you're going to be a doctor!	Joale, ntate, u tla ba ngaka!
It is difficult to say which one is better.	Ho thata ho bolela hore na ke ofe ea molemo.
He wanted his departure.	O ne a batla ho tsamaea ha hae.
All of this is working.	Tsena tsohle li ntse li sebetsa.
Then go to sleep.	Ebe u robala.
Who knows where it will be next week.	Ke mang ea tsebang moo e tla ba teng bekeng e tlang.
And there is no need.	Mme haho hlokahale.
There was nothing.	Ho ne ho se letho.
I called my mother.	Ke ile ka letsetsa mme.
I will keep it.	Ke tla e boloka.
That's what it is.	Ke eona taba eo.
The food here was delicious.	Lijo tsa mona li ne li le monate.
I have heard many good things about your work.	Ke utloile lintho tse ngata tse ntle ka mosebetsi oa hau.
But instead, for some reason, there is something.	Empa ho e-na le hoo, ka lebaka le itseng, ho na le ho hong.
Or need it.	Kapa ho hloka ka hona ho.
Or when you are very skeptical.	Kapa ha o belaela haholo.
It was fun.	Ho bile monate.
I asked him what was going on.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na ho etsahalang.
He is in a very dangerous place.	O sebakeng se kotsi haholo.
It was as if he were talking to himself.	E ne eka o bua a le mong.
Moreover, there has to be a level of giving and getting here.	Ho feta moo, ho tlameha ho be le boemo ba ho fana le ho fihla mona.
He was there last night.	O ne a le teng maobane bosiu.
We will certainly see.	Ka sebele re tla bona.
I saw nothing.	Ha kea bona letho.
Many knowledgeable people are learning about it.	Batho ba bangata ba tsebang ba ntse ba ithuta ka eona.
Better days, of course.	Matsatsi a betere, ehlile.
However, this was not the first time they had met.	Leha ho le joalo, eo e ne e se lekhetlo la pele ba kopana.
He did not have to know why.	O ne a sa tlameha ho tseba lebaka.
I thought it was a fun day.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke letsatsi le monate.
I made a lot of money.	Ke entse chelete e ngata haholo.
People say it's a good thing.	Batho ba re ke ntho e ntle.
I had to fix it.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho e lokisa.
He wouldn't have to do that.	A ka be a sa tlameha ho etsa hoo.
We had a great day.	Re bile le matsatsi a monate.
Now we have to go.	Joale re tlameha ho tsamaea.
This is not just about me.	Sena ha se bue ka nna feela.
He saw it.	O e bone.
It's a much older place than this.	Ke sebaka sa khale haholo ho feta sena.
Yes, they should.	E, ke hobane'ng ha ba lokela .
He understood people.	O ne a utloisisa batho.
Everything looks so much better.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e shebahala e le betere haholo.
I don't care what you say.	Ha ke tsotelle seo o se buang.
Some of them can go.	Ba bang ba bona ba ka tsamaea.
I really enjoy doing it.	Ruri ke thabela ho e etsa.
I just can't be human here.	Ha ke khone ho ba motho feela mona.
She was going to have a baby.	O ne a tla ba le ngoana.
Che, che, che, che.	Che, che, che, che.
They can't just read a book.	Ba ke ke ba bala buka feela.
It's a very strange thing.	Ke ntho e makatsang haholo.
But we both took it.	Empa ka bobeli re ile ra e nka.
Find another restaurant.	Fumana ntlo e 'ngoe ea lijo.
However, they probably did not do it, they probably never did.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong ha ba e etse, mohlomong ha ho mohla ba kileng ba e etsa.
But there it is.	Empa ke eo.
I am going.	Ke ea.
All you have to do is make their job even harder.	Seo u lokelang ho se etsa ke ho etsa hore mosebetsi oa bona o be boima le ho feta.
You can't just come in here and say those things!	U ke ke ua kena mona feela 'me ua bua lintho tseo!
If there is, well.	Haeba e teng, hantle.
I did not find his car.	Ha kea fumana koloi ea hae.
The danger is very, very, very serious.	Kotsi e teng haholo, haholo.
It's good for you.	Ho molemo ho uena.
My parents are not together.	Batsoali ba ka ha ba hammoho.
You don't know how to say anything.	Ha o tsebe ho bua letho.
I'm sure of it now.	Ke na le bonnete ba hona joale.
She is only three years old.	O lilemo li tharo feela.
Now I know you did not get it.	Joale kea tseba hore ha ua ka ua e fumana.
Of course you will get more than that.	Ho hlakile hore u tla fumana ho feta moo.
I mean when you're here, you don't know where you are.	Ke re ha u mona, ha u tsebe moo u leng teng.
Real place.	Sebaka sa sebele.
And we all know what's going to happen then.	Mme bohle re tseba se tla etsahala ka nako eo.
He thought he was useless.	O ne a nahana hore ha a na thuso.
He just stands there.	O ema feela.
This is what you do.	Sena ke seo u se etsang.
Just stay in your room.	Lula feela ka kamoreng ea hau.
It's clear when you look at it.	E hlakile ha u e sheba.
He needed to leave.	O ne a hloka hore a tsamaee.
Nor were they just talking about him.	Leha e le hore ba ne ba bua ka eena feela.
But that was not true.	Empa hoo ho ne ho se ’nete.
He was in pain and won.	O ne a nkile bohloko mme a hlola.
No one is making you leave.	Ha ho motho ea etsang hore u tsamaee.
That can be nice and simple.	Seo se ka ba se setle le se bonolo.
Stop, it really does get into someone.	Ema, ho hlile hoa kena motho.
But sometimes.	Empa ka linako tse ling.
As before but very powerful.	Joalo ka pele empa e matla haholo.
You wonder what will happen to your life.	Ua ipotsa hore na ho tla etsahala eng ka bophelo ba hau.
That's great.	Ke hantle haholo.
All he needed.	Sohle seo a neng a se hloka.
Thank you so much for talking to me today.	Ke leboha haholo ka ho bua le 'na kajeno.
I can imagine why.	Ke khona ho nahana hore na hobaneng.
No, that was not true.	Che, hoo e ne e se ’nete.
Such an image would cost money.	Setšoantšo se joalo se ne se tla hloka chelete.
Her classmate and teacher loved it.	Sehlopha sa hae le tichere ba ne ba e rata.
It was the first time we saw him at work.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele re mo bona a sebetsa.
My dad goes to work every morning.	Ntate o ea mosebetsing hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
I have a son like him	Ke na le mora ea tšoanang le eena
If that is what they think, what will we do.	Haeba ke seo ba se nahanang, re tla etsa joang.
We will leave him then.	Re tla mo tlohela ka nako eo.
Then the second.	Ebe ea bobeli.
Do not stay too.	Le uena u se ke ua lula.
And don't tell me you're not, because you are.	Mme o seke wa mpolella hore ha o jwalo, hobane o jwalo.
He told me not to go.	O ile a mpolella hore ke se ke ka tsamaea.
He felt the same way about me.	O ne a ikutloa joalo ka 'na.
There is not enough water here.	Ha ho na metsi a lekaneng mona.
This was not easy.	Sena se ne se se bonolo.
He says you really can.	O re ehlile u ka khona.
Well, this looks great.	Hantle, sena se shebahala se le setle.
Where do you work?	U sebetsa kae?
Many were drinking.	Ba bangata ba ne ba noa.
I used this technique.	Ke ile ka sebelisa mokhoa ona.
We knew in advance that we had to start strong.	Re ne re tseba ho kena hore re lokela ho qala ka matla.
You knew your way.	U ne u tseba tsela ea hau.
It's just like something you can do.	Ho joalo feela ka ntho eo u ka e etsang.
I heard they would live.	Ke utloile ba tla phela.
Find a way.	Fumana tsela.
He may have thought of himself as an actor.	E ka 'na eaba o ne a nahana ka eena e le sebapali.
It's not that hard.	Ha ho thata hakaalo.
None of them can.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ka khonang.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore ha ho joalo.
You need space to save it.	U hloka sebaka sa ho e boloka.
This way please.	Ka tsela ena ka kopo.
Do you want it now?	Na ua e batla hona joale?
See where it is.	Bona moo e leng teng.
He said nothing.	Ha a ka a bua letho.
That's the kind of person he is.	Ke mofuta oa motho eo e leng eena.
It is the work of man.	Ke mosebetsi oa motho.
I have a problem with that suggestion.	Ke na le bothata ka tlhahiso eo.
Good job!	Mosebetsi o motle!
As you read?	Joalo ka ha u bala?
So, yes, those who know my family know our situation.	Kahoo, e, ba tsebang lelapa la ka ba tseba boemo ba rōna.
We are already wet.	Re se re le metsi.
I wanted to suffer.	Ke ne ke batla ho utloa bohloko.
I do not know his name.	Ha ke tsebe lebitso la hae.
He was very strong.	O ne a le matla haholo.
It was really like that.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le joang.
Only his days.	Ke matsatsi a hae feela.
He did that often.	O ne a ntse a etsa hoo hangata.
The weight of this car.	Boima ba koloi ena.
But it will not always be.	Empa e ke ke ea lula e le teng.
And if you do not understand something, speak up.	'Me haeba u sa utloisise ho hong, bua.
He almost had it.	O ne a batla a e-na le eona.
But he has an opinion.	Empa o na le maikutlo.
It can be completely innocent.	E ka ba e hlokang molato ho hang.
I have to try something new.	Ke tlameha ho leka ntho e ncha.
Finally, he saw his opportunity.	Qetellong, o ile a bona monyetla oa hae.
He just starts.	O qala feela.
If he didn't want her so much.	Hoja o ne a sa mo batle hakaalo.
He knows who he is.	O a tseba hore ke mang.
And he certainly knew where he was.	Mme ruri o ne a tseba moo a leng teng.
This also happens.	Sena le sona sea etsahala.
Error, in my opinion.	Phoso, ka maikutlo a ka.
My mother used to do those things.	’Mè o ne a etsa lintho tseo.
I thought it was important for someone to go home.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho bohlokoa hore motho a ee hae.
But do not sleep.	Empa u se ke ua robala.
His feet were close.	Maoto a hae a ne a le haufi.
We called her at work, but she was not there.	Re ile ra mo letsetsa mosebetsing, empa o ne a le sieo.
That's what they want.	Ke kamoo ba batlang kateng.
Everything else may continue to be as it is.	Lintho tse ling tsohle li ka 'na tsa tsoela pele ho ba kamoo li leng kateng.
There should be no problems.	Ha hoa lokela ho ba le mathata.
You need to know this.	U lokela ho tseba sena.
We have to earn money.	Re tlameha ho fumana chelete.
There is a chance that we could hear something at any time.	Ho na le monyetla oa hore re ka utloa ho hong ka nako efe kapa efe.
That is another opportunity.	Eo ke monyetla o mong.
I don't know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke eng.
Both are new.	Ka bobeli e ncha.
So you can say all the bad things you want.	Kahoo u ka bua lintho tsohle tse mpe tseo u li batlang.
Some will always go and will not help you much.	Ba bang ba tla lula ba tsamaea 'me ba ke ke ba u thusa haholo.
He was sure.	O ne a na le bonnete.
He ate the taste of that delicious food.	O ne a ja ka monate oa lijo tseo tse monate.
A strange thought for me.	Mohopolo o makatsang ho nna.
It was a good thing.	E ne e le ntho e ntle.
He made a phone call.	O ile a etsa mohala.
Everyone should talk to me.	E mong le e mong o lokela ho bua le nna.
There will be ample opportunity for that.	Ho tla ba le monyetla o lekaneng bakeng sa seo.
Some people do not understand your feelings.	Batho ba bang ha ba utloisise maikutlo a hao.
Do not hope that they will understand.	U se ke ua tšepa hore ba tla utloisisa.
She could not even cry.	O ne a sitoa le ho lla.
Now here is what he said.	Jwale seo a se buileng ke sena.
Here is the good one.	E ntle ke ena.
Then he knew what that thing was.	Joale o ne a tseba hore na ntho eo ke efe.
Do not dwell on the past.	U se ke ua lula u nahana ka lintho tse fetileng.
They are no longer mine.	Ha e sa le ba ka.
This works very well.	Sena se sebetsa hantle haholo.
No one treated her like that.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo tšoara joalo.
But he could speak.	Empa o ne a khona ho bua.
He looked up at the scene.	A sheba sebakeng.
I would like to.	Nka thabela.
He was very, very, very wet.	O ne a le metsi haholo, haholo, haholo.
He was not a man.	E ne e se motho.
It happens to other people.	Ho etsahala ho batho ba bang.
They have a baby.	Ba ba le ngoana.
Don't talk to me like that.	O seke wa bua le nna jwalo.
For good news.	Bakeng sa litaba tse monate.
To have them for her.	Ho ba le tsona bakeng sa tsa hae.
Lots of that.	Tse ngata tseo.
He was just happy to be there.	O ne a thabetse feela hore o ne a le teng.
He was arrested unexpectedly.	O ile a tšoaroa a sa lebella.
Good job.	Mosebetsi o motle.
Think more.	Nahana haholoanyane.
Some things you need to do.	Lintho tse ling tseo u lokelang ho li etsa.
Then she would tell him that she loved him.	Joale o ne a tla mo bolella hore oa mo rata.
It's not for nothing.	Ha se bakeng sa letho.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka seo.
The problem is, someone did that.	Bothata ke hore ho na le motho ea entseng joalo.
You ask a lot.	U botsa haholo.
I said you ride the way you are.	Ke itse o palama kamoo o leng kateng.
When he had said this, he wept.	Ha a qeta ho bua joalo, a lla.
Very easy to use.	Ho bonolo haholo ho e sebelisa.
It could be better.	Ho ka ba betere.
After sitting down, he ate quickly.	Ka mor’a ho lula fatše, o ile a ja kapele.
And let's not say there is a second player.	Mme ha re re ho na le sebapali sa bobeli.
But this is what he did.	Empa sena ke seo a ileng a se etsa.
So, we go back.	Kahoo, re khutlela morao.
Many children are learning to read.	Bana ba bangata ba ithuta ho bala.
Once, and just once, he was here.	Hang, mme hang feela, o bile mona.
He would have his job.	O ne a tla ba le mosebetsi oa hae.
That is even more important.	Seo se bohlokoa ho feta.
In fact, it is often necessary.	Ha e le hantle, hangata hoa hlokahala.
It may not be.	E ka 'na eaba ha ho joalo.
Living my life, my life.	Ho phela bophelo ba ka, bophelo ba ka.
He was very heavy.	O ne a le boima haholo.
That was easy.	Seo se ne se le bonolo.
Buy their stuff.	Reka lintho tsa bona.
She is happy that she finished the job.	O thabetse hore ebe o qetile mosebetsi oo.
If you do, then you have not really mastered it.	Haeba u etsa joalo, joale ha u e-s'o e tsebe hantle.
Such a thing would be already difficult.	Ntho e joalo e ne e tla be e se e ntse e le boima.
You know that, too.	O tseba seo, hape.
We can always try again.	Re ka leka hape kamehla.
As it was.	Joalo ka ha ho bile.
The fact of the matter is.	'Nete ea taba ke hore.
Sometimes you win.	Ka linako tse ling ua hlola.
This should be even better.	Sena se lokela ho ba molemo ho feta.
The team played well together.	Sehlopha se ile sa bapala hammoho hantle.
To real people.	Ho batho ba sebele.
We don't see it here.	Ha re bone se ka mona.
But that will only take a short time.	Empa seo se tla nka nako e seng kae feela.
Yet I have seen such work.	Leha ho le joalo ke bone mosebetsi o joalo.
He will be no more.	Ha a sa tla hlola a eba teng.
Because we did not want this to be easy.	Hobane re ne re sa batle hore sena se be bonolo.
They spent their first night there.	Ba ile ba qeta bosiu ba bona ba pele moo.
This is a picture of your new home.	Sena ke setšoantšo sa ntlo ea hau e ncha.
She was strong, beautiful, and her own.	O ne a le matla, a le motle, le wa hae.
I want anything if it is fun.	Ke batla eng kapa eng haeba e le monate.
I have to start telling the whole truth.	Ke tlameha ho qala ho bua 'nete eohle.
However, this is not really the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se hlile ha se joalo.
Our doctor called the house and came to see us.	Ngaka ea rōna e ile ea letsetsa ntlo ’me ea tla ho tla re bona.
They may not survive.	Ba ka 'na ba se ke ba phela.
They have to find another way.	Ba tlameha ho fumana tsela e 'ngoe.
I wanted my kids to be with me.	Ke ne ke lakatsa hore bana ba ka ba be le ’na.
, and his family.	, le lelapa la hae.
That hurts, too.	Hoo ho bohloko, le hona.
He would find them.	O ne a tla ba fumana.
I did not want to tell you.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho o bolella.
I have an idea.	Ke na le mohopolo.
However, doing this properly is not easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ho etsa sena hantle ha ho bonolo.
He is a strong man.	Ke monna ea matla.
If anyone has any questions, write here.	Haeba ho na le motho ea nang le lipotso, ngola mona.
No real man does that.	Ha ho monna oa sebele ea etsang joalo.
But strangely enough.	Empa ka tsela e makatsang.
We caught him there.	Re ile ra mo tšoara moo.
But do so.	Empa etsa joalo.
My first ones.	Tsa ka tsa pele.
So, where do you come from?	Joale, u tsoa hokae?
You can't fix it the first time.	U ke ke ua e lokisa lekhetlo la pele.
It's hard to find that money.	Ho thata ho fumana chelete eo.
I think he doesn't want to tell me.	Ke nahana hore ha a batle ho mpolella.
When the police arrived, the man was arrested.	Ha mapolesa a fihla, monna eo o ile a tšoaroa.
That is no easy task.	Oo hase mosebetsi o bonolo.
Well, you're too late.	Be, u morao haholo.
But you have to go.	Empa u tlameha ho tsamaea.
Have new things.	Eba le lintho tse ncha.
It certainly wasn't that bad.	Ka sebele e ne e se mpe hakaalo.
It can be very fun, but it is not for everyone.	Ho ka ba monate haholo, empa ha se ea motho e mong le e mong.
But it was a close thing.	Empa e ne e le ntho e haufi.
I can't talk about it, ever.	Ha ke khone ho bua ka eona, le ka mohla.
Stay with us, and tell us what you know.	Dula le rona, mme o re bolelle seo o se tsebang.
That would be nice.	Seo se ka ba molemo.
We knew what they were doing.	Re ne re tseba hore na ba etsa’ng.
This book looks like an important old book.	Buka ena e shebahala joaloka ea khale ea bohlokoa.
Maybe he can learn something from her tonight.	Mohlomong a ka ithuta ho hong ho eena bosiung bona.
Something to talk about.	Ntho eo u ka buang ka eona.
It came back to me, as always.	E ile ea khutlela ho 'na, joalo ka kamehla.
, le.	, le.
Just do it.	E etse feela.
They said they heard things like this all the time.	Ba itse ba utloa lintho tse kang tsena ka linako tsohle.
They like that.	Ba rata seo.
We can have that.	Re ka ba le seo.
Of course, you can find it easy.	Ehlile, o ka fumana ho le bonolo.
This was his whole life.	Ena e ne e le bophelo bohle ba hae.
I certainly never thought, or even said.	Ka sebele ha ke e-s'o ka ke nahana, kapa hona ho bua joalo.
He seemed strong.	O ne a bonahala a le matla.
He would not say anything.	O ne a sa tlo bua letho.
I would go in.	Ke ne ke tla kena.
I have another chance.	Ke na le monyetla o mong.
He knew the danger.	O ne a tseba kotsi.
Just to save.	Feela ho boloka.
But it does not matter.	Empa ha ho na taba.
But the worst.	Empa e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
I have to leave at any time.	Nka tlameha ho tsamaea neng kapa neng.
I don’t think they knew what they had to do with me.	Ha ke nahane hore ba ne ba tseba seo ba lokelang ho se etsa ka 'na.
You will probably be writing a letter sometime this week.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe o tla ngola lengolo ka nako e itseng bekeng ena.
So you know it was good.	Kahoo ua tseba hore e ne e le molemo.
She is just fine.	O hantle joalo.
You are not sure if it is important.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na ke ea bohlokoa.
Now you have a second.	Joale u na le ea bobeli.
It would not help him here, he realized.	E ne e ke ke ea mo thusa mona, o ile a hlokomela.
He heard instead of seeing them.	O ile a utloa ho e-na le ho bona.
It doesn't matter what it is.	Ha ho na taba hore na ke efe.
What he would say.	Seo a neng a tla se bua.
Happy week to read it all !.	Beke e monate ea ho bala bohle!.
I pause, wondering if it will sit down.	Ke ema hanyane, ke ipotsa hore na e tla lula fatše.
He loved her, you know.	O ne a mo rata, ua tseba.
He has his father very much in him.	O na le ntate oa hae haholo ka ho eena.
You want people to want to help you.	U batla hore batho ba batle ho u thusa.
He was just thinking about each day to come.	O ne a nahana feela ka letsatsi le leng le le leng le tlang.
However, it seems that they will not do so.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bonahala eka ba ke ke ba etsa joalo.
He had never seen that before.	O ne a eso bone tseo pele.
But in the future.	Empa nakong e tlang.
Can anyone, please?	Na ho na le motho ea ka khonang, ka kopo?
This is my whole life.	Bona ke bophelo bohle ba ka.
I hope we spend some time together before she leaves.	Ke tšepa hore re tla qeta nako re le hammoho pele a tsamaea.
Such a first impression.	Maikutlo a joalo a pele.
She cannot read or write.	Ha a tsebe ho bala le ho ngola.
Do it any way you like.	Etsa ka tsela efe kapa efe eo u e ratang.
We went to a costume party.	Re ne re ile moketeng oa liaparo.
After that we ate breakfast, which was very tasty.	Ka mor'a moo re ile ra ja lijo tsa hoseng, tse neng li le monate haholo.
He enjoyed that.	O ile a thabela seo.
We love you so much, so much.	Re u rata haholo, haholo.
He still has to call.	O ntse a lokela ho letsa.
We can't even now with this.	Ha re khone le hona joale ka sena.
But he did not come.	Empa ha a ka a tla.
He did just that.	O ile a etsa joalo.
I'll see you next week.	Ke tla u bona bekeng e tlang.
I arrived early and left late.	Ke ile ka fihla kapele ’me ka tsamaea ka mor’a nako.
It can be helpful.	Ho ka ba le thuso.
I will be with you.	Ke tla ba le uena.
However, this happened in time.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se ile sa etsahala ka nako.
There was only one.	Ho ne ho na le feela.
Your children know.	Bana ba hau baa tseba.
My first after three years.	Ea ka ea pele ka mor'a lilemo tse tharo.
I no longer have problems.	Ha ke sa na mathata.
It looks very nice.	E shebahala e le ntle haholo.
They are grateful to us.	Ba leboha ho rona.
But that is still the case.	Empa seo e ntse e le boemo.
You read about it and see what you think.	U bala ho eona 'me u bone seo u se nahanang.
Out, out, out.	Ho tsoa, ​​ho tsoa, ​​ho tsoa.
But try.	Empa leka.
The idea was at the party.	Maikutlo a ne a le moketeng.
Maybe he would see them soon.	Mohlomong o ne a tla ba bona haufinyane.
He is there.	O teng.
The only thing was, he did not want to leave.	Ntho feela e ne e le, o ne a sa batle ho tsamaea.
I'm glad you asked.	Ke thabetse hore ebe u ile ua botsa.
She would be a woman.	E ne e tla ba mosali.
Today was a lot of fun.	Kajeno ho ne ho le monate haholo.
But then, now the fun begins.	Empa joale, joale monate oa qala.
They could not, they could not help him.	Ba ne ba sa khone, ba ne ba ke ke ba khona ho mo thusa.
They do not understand him,.	Ha ba mo utloisise,.
I'm sure he shouldn't do that.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ha a lokela ho etsa joalo.
They did not want them.	Ba ne ba sa ba batle.
And it was not the first.	'Me e ne e se ea pele.
But you have to stay here.	Empa u tlameha ho lula mona.
He was almost there.	O ne a batla a le teng.
It can work.	E ka sebetsa.
You should go and ask them.	O lokela ho ya ba botsa.
It was necessary then.	Ho ne ho hlokahala ka nako eo.
I do not like this.	Ha ke rate sena.
That applies to you, so you do not have to.	Taba eo e ea sebetsa, kahoo ha ua tlameha.
I will do that in the morning.	Ke tla etsa joalo hoseng.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
That is your decision.	Ke qeto ea hao.
No one came out.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a tsoa.
You don't want to tell me, you don't have to.	Ha o batle ho mpolella, ha o a tlameha.
I felt happy.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke thabile.
So what do you think?	Joale u nahana joang?
I do not know where.	Ha ke tsebe kae.
It works together over time.	Le sebetsa hammoho ka morao ho nako.
I decided that was not the case.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea hore ha ho joalo.
I know it is good for you.	Kea tseba hore ho na le molemo ho uena.
From here on there is no alternative.	Ho tloha mona ha ho na mokhoa o mong.
It was his book.	E ne e le buka ya hae.
Empty room.	Kamore e se nang letho.
They want to see them do well.	Ba batla ho ba bona ba etsa hantle.
He was very happy to do so.	O ne a thabile haholo hore a ka etsa joalo.
They should speak.	Ba lokela ho bua.
I just want to say thank you.	Ke batla feela ho re kea leboha.
And sometimes it's good, and sometimes it's not good.	'Me ka linako tse ling e ntle,' me ka linako tse ling ha e ntle.
Not just for me, but also for you.	E seng bakeng sa ka feela, empa le bakeng sa hao.
I'll call you tomorrow.	Ke tla u letsetsa hosane.
But without it.	Empa ntle le eona .
He was often alone.	Hangata o ne a le mong.
I think it was important.	Ke nahana hore e ne e le bohlokoa.
But you can't spend money.	Empa u ke ke ua sebelisa chelete.
Because you can't start a project like this.	Hobane u ke ke ua qala mosebetsi o kang ona.
I hope you have a wonderful day.	Ke tšepa hore u na le letsatsi le monate.
It's bad.	E mpe.
I'm really sorry.	A masoabi ka sebele.
It was not necessary for him.	Ho ne ho se hakaalo ho eena.
She opened her arms.	A bula matsoho a hae.
Many parents ask their children to read books.	Batsoali ba bangata ba kopa bana ba bona ho bala libuka.
There is something there, but we do not know what it is.	Ho na le ntho e teng, empa ha re tsebe hore na ke eng.
Or even more so.	Kapa ho joalo le ho feta.
She had plenty of time to find another man.	O ne a e-na le nako e ngata ea ho fumana monna e mong.
It's hard to let go of it.	Ho thata ho e tlohela.
Then maybe get a life.	Ebe mohlomong fumana bophelo.
It is not an easy thing to do.	Ha se ntho e bonolo ho e etsa.
I have to say it starts first.	Ke lokela ho bolela hore e qala pele.
I decided.	Ke entse qeto.
You will be better off asking a question.	U tla ba betere ha u botsa potso.
The place looks empty.	Sebaka se shebahala se se na letho.
I do not know why.	Ha ke e-s'o tsebe lebaka.
Who did this?	Ke mang ea entseng see?
When he meets you.	Ha o kopana le wena.
It was the first time I had met anyone like them.	Ke ne ke qala ho kopana le motho ea tšoanang le bona.
He wore the same clothes every day.	O ne a apara liaparo tse tšoanang letsatsi le leng le le leng.
They worked all night.	Ba ile ba sebetsa bosiu bohle.
I do not like to talk.	Ha ke rate ho bua.
Which is close.	E leng haufi.
It is true that they had a lot of food.	Ke ’nete hore ba ne ba e-na le lijo tse ngata.
Make no mistake, this is our time.	U se ke ua etsa phoso, ena ke nako ea rona.
We did not make a final decision.	Ha rea ​​etsa qeto ea ho qetela.
He wanted to do it, but he wanted to be sure.	O ne a batla ho e etsa, empa o ne a batla ho ba le bonnete.
But it was nothing.	Empa ho ne ho se letho.
Which is just amazing.	E leng ntho e makatsang feela.
Come to us.	Tlo ho rona.
They have a good attitude about them.	Ba na le mokhoa o motle ka bona.
It could not have happened.	E ne e ke ke ea etsahala.
And maybe more.	'Me mohlomong ho feta.
Anything you can think of.	Eng kapa eng eo u ka e nahanang.
I will go with him.	Ke tla tsamaea le eena.
To be honest.	Ho bua 'nete.
Of course, no.	Ha e le hantle, che.
I mean, here.	Ke bolela, mona.
If not, do not do so.	Haeba ho se joalo, u se ke ua etsa joalo.
Anything this dog wanted, it was his.	Ntho efe kapa efe eo ntja ena e neng e e batla, e ne e le ea hae.
And it is always good.	'Me e lula e le molemo.
They have never happened before.	Ha ho mohla li kileng tsa etsahala pele.
Their feelings are hurt.	Maikutlo a bona a utloile bohloko.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea hore le eena a nahane ka mosali.
People are asking us to take one place.	Batho ba kopa ho re nka sebaka se le seng.
They have a lot of weird stuff.	Ba na le lintho tse ngata tse makatsang.
Obviously I thought this was a good thing.	Ho hlakile hore ke ile ka nka sena e le ntho e ntle.
You don't have to see anything.	Ha o a tlameha ho bona letho.
I do not know how it happened.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ho bile joang.
We were in the same group.	Re ne re le sehlopheng se le seng.
He really enjoys talking to other people.	Ka sebele o thabela ho bua le batho ba bang.
You are not what others think you are.	Ha u seo ba bang ba nahanang hore u sona.
I will let them in.	Ke tla ba lumella ho kena.
If it is nothing, it is nothing.	Haeba e se letho, ha se letho.
I got my chance.	Ke fumane monyetla oa ka.
Your age does not matter to me, you are important to me.	Lilemo tsa hao ha li na taba ho 'na, u bohlokoa ho 'na.
You don't care what it is.	Ha le tsotelle hore na ke eng.
It's not you.	Ha se uena.
There is no easy way, right?	Haho tsela e bonolo, haho jwalo?
We were treated the same way.	Re ile ra tšoaroa ka tsela e tšoanang.
But it will not happen.	Empa e ke ke ea etsahala.
Just like it.	E rate feela.
I do not understand why he is here.	Ha ke utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha a le mona.
Such a gentle man.	Monna ea bonolo joalo.
Buy coffee.	Reka kofi.
No one has ever read them.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a li bala.
You see, that's what you have to do by getting out of the law.	Ua bona, seo o tlameha ho se etsa ka ho tsoa ka molao.
They played well.	Ba ile ba bapala hantle.
At the time he did not care what happened.	Ka nako eo o ne a sa tsotelle hore na ho etsahala'ng.
So he takes the life of another 'child'.	Ka hona o nka bophelo ba 'ngoana' e mong.
Three feet is three feet.	Maoto a mararo ke maoto a mararo.
But there was an accident.	Empa ho bile le kotsi.
It just starts off well to meet then.	E qala feela hantle ho kopana ka nako eo.
Go out with them.	Tsoa le bona.
Work hard to earn money.	Tšoara ka thata haholo ho fumana chelete.
They never had children together.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba ba le bana hammoho.
And the other children.	Le bana ba bang.
It seems a bit weird right now.	Ho bonahala e batla e le ntho e makatsang hona joale.
You do not eat.	Ha o je.
She loved her husband and her life.	O ne a rata monna oa hae le bophelo ba hae.
You do not have to worry about anything.	Ha ua lokela ho utloa bohloko ka letho.
He learns often, but does not understand very well.	O ithuta hangata, empa ha a utloisise hantle.
It can't know nothing.	Ha e khone ho tseba letho.
Maybe it doesn’t have to be money.	Mohlomong ha ho hlokahale hore e be chelete.
So, where are we going from there?	Joale, re tla ea hokae ho tloha moo?
I just have to tell you.	Ke tlameha ho o bolella feela.
Of course he had seen it.	Ehlile o ne a e bone.
There was a lot of money in it.	Ho ne ho e-na le chelete e ngata ho eona.
Of course, he also did not plan.	Ha e le hantle, le eena ha aa ka a rera.
I want to see it.	ke batla ho e bona.
What a high.	Ke eng e phahameng.
Thank you for the opportunity to win.	Kea leboha ka monyetla oa ho hlola.
You can have some and go.	U ka ba le tse ling 'me ua tsamaea.
Besides, we are no longer school children.	Ntle ho moo, ha re sa le bana ba sekolo.
I do not believe so.	Ha ke lumele hore ho joalo.
And you know what he looks like.	'Me ua tseba hore na o shebahala joang.
I left shortly thereafter.	Ke ile ka tsamaea kapele ka mor'a moo.
As a result.	Ka hoo.
That was the last one.	Leo e bile la ho qetela.
They did not give him enough.	Ha baa ka ba mo fa ho lekaneng.
Or if they did, they were not his friends.	Kapa haeba ba ne ba etsa joalo e ne e se metsoalle ea hae.
Have money, have it all.	E-ba le chelete, e-ba le tsohle.
There is still.	Ho sa le teng.
Some of them were powerful.	Tse ling tsa tsona e ne e le tse matla.
This is such a good book.	Ena ke buka e ntle joalo.
This was very difficult for me.	Sena se ne se le boima haholo ho 'na.
I am very happy now.	Ke thabile haholo hona joale.
He says where he was, it doesn't matter.	O re o bile kae, ha ho na taba.
Her legs hurt.	Maoto a hae a bohloko.
These are some of the most beautiful things.	Ena ke lintho tse ling tse ntle haholo.
And he never knew it.	Mme le ka mohla o ne a sa e tsebe.
Either way she still looks good.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe o ntse a shebahala hantle.
It's not him.	Ha se eena.
So there would be no problems there.	Kahoo ho ne ho ka se be le mathata moo.
In this way, they appear again.	Ka mokhoa ona, li bonahala hape.
But they did not do that because they were telling the truth.	Empa ha baa ka ba etsa joalo hobane ba bua ’nete.
Walk like water.	Tsamaea joalo ka metsi.
So, there is my request to open.	Kahoo, ho na le kopo ea ka ea ho bula.
Very well everyone.	Hantle haholo bohle.
It's a real place.	Ke sebaka sa sebele.
I think a lot of people don’t get the book.	Ke nahana hore batho ba bangata ha ba fumane buka.
Saying things but not saying them right.	Ho bua lintho empa o sa li bue hantle.
Then ask questions.	Ebe u botsa lipotso.
And there was nothing he could do about it.	Mme ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang ka hona.
If we know how to look.	Haeba re tseba ho shebahala.
Thank you very much both.	Ke le leboha haholo ka bobeli.
He decided he had to do it.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore o tlameha ho etsa joalo.
Even if you felt compelled.	Leha u ne u ikutloa u tlameha.
It belongs to my time.	Ke oa nako ea ka.
They certainly did not take that to heart.	Ruri ba ne ba sa nka seo le bona.
Do not sleep with this if you are thinking of doing it.	U se ke ua robala ka sena haeba u ntse u nahana ho e etsa.
But he did not feel it.	Empa ha aa ka a ikutloa.
That was my name.	Leo e ne e le lebitso la ka.
Great man.	Monna o moholo.
We will find him.	Re tla mo fumana.
Start small, but really get started.	Qala hanyane, empa ha e le hantle qala.
I hope you never forget your place again.	Ke lebeletse hore u se ke ua lebala sebaka sa hau hape.
He would stand.	O ne a tla ema.
I know it well and it is very easy to open it.	Ke e tseba hantle 'me e bonolo haholo ho e bula.
They're still going to school, they're working.	Ba ntse ba kena sekolo, ba ntse ba sebetsa.
But he is ahead.	Empa o ka pele.
Sometimes, it works that way.	Ka linako tse ling, e sebetsa ka tsela eo.
I start walking again.	Ke qala ho tsamaea hape.
You know that to be true.	Ua tseba hore hoo ke 'nete.
It was never good.	Ha ho mohla e neng e le ntle.
Or whatever, of course.	Kapa eng kapa eng, ka 'nete.
The two became close friends.	Bobeli ba bona e ile ea e-ba metsoalle e haufi.
He said he needed his help.	O ile a re o hloka thuso ea hae.
The atmosphere was pleasant.	Boemo bo ne bo le monate.
Check out the evening news.	Sheba litaba tsa mantsiboea.
He's not out yet.	Ha a sa tsoa.
Nothing was a problem.	Ha ho letho le neng le le bothata.
However, everything else happens.	Leha ho le joalo, lintho tse ling tsohle li etsahala.
This is not true yet.	Sena ha se 'nete leha ho le joalo.
We love that.	Re rata tseo.
They did not want it.	Ba ne ba sa e batle.
I think you see it better.	Ke nahana hore o e bona betere.
The latter is better.	Ea ho qetela e molemo.
We'll get it.	Re tla e fumana.
You will be able to see how hard we work.	U tla khona ho bona hore na re sebetsa ka thata hakae.
Ask others to help you.	Kopa ba bang ho o thusa.
It was so nice to see him last night.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo ho mo bona bosiung ba maobane.
He didn't need to talk, neither did I.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale hore a bue, leha e le nna.
It looks so much better.	E shebahala e le betere haholo.
That was stupid, stupid to say.	Eo e ne e le ntho e hlokang kelello, e hlokang kelello ho e bua.
I think they are very close.	Ke nahana hore ba haufi haholo.
They do nothing.	Ha ba etse letho.
We all have something in common.	Kaofela re na le ntho eo re tšoanang ka eona.
It was as if he were reading my mind.	E ne eka o bala maikutlo a ka.
He can't do that.	A ke ke a etsa joalo.
There was never a problem.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba le bothata.
He does the work for you.	O o etsetsa mosebetsi.
It is for the best.	Ke bakeng sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
And he asked you what you were doing.	Mme a o botsa hore na o etsang.
He was with his wife and family.	O ne a e-na le mosali oa hae le lelapa la hae.
I could see both at the same time.	Ke ne ke khona ho li bona ka bobeli ka nako e le 'ngoe.
I heard.	Ke utloile.
I have to tell you.	Ke lokela ho o bolella.
Big baby.	Ngoana e moholo.
But we did not write that book.	Empa ha rea ​​ngola buka eo.
We will be nothing more.	Re tla be re se letho hape.
That's just what you are.	Ke seo o leng sona feela.
He said he hoped he would feel better soon.	O ile a re o tšepa hore o tla ikutloa a le betere haufinyane.
Yes, that's right.	E, ho joalo.
But other than that, the issue is still there.	Empa ntle le moo, taba e ntse e le teng.
It was difficult to say just how old he was.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bolela hore na o ne a le lilemo li kae.
The one you have now.	Eo u nang le eona hona joale.
Do not take more	U se ke ua nka ho feta
He had never been a master at using a weapon.	O ne a e-s'o be setsebi sa ho sebelisa sebetsa.
I don't want to do anything but this.	Ha ke batle ho etsa letho ntle le sena.
I did not know the man's name.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na lebitso la monna eo ke mang.
He says it exactly as it is.	O e bolela hantle kamoo e leng kateng.
Call if you have any questions.	Letsetsa haeba u na le lipotso.
His head would be empty.	Hlooho ea hae e ne e tla be e se na letho.
I do not have my time.	Ha ke na nako ea ka.
It took a long time.	Ho nkile nako e telele.
Unless you have something better.	Ntle le haeba o na le ho hong ho betere.
I did not see any of this.	Ha kea ka ka bona letho la sena.
Some are easy to visit, while others are very dangerous.	Tse ling li bonolo ho li etela, ha tse ling li kotsi haholo.
Do not try to understand it.	O seke oa leka ho e utloisisa.
I'm very tired of it.	Ke khathetse haholo ke eona.
Nothing will do that.	Ha ho letho le tla etsa joalo.
Which is strange.	E leng ntho e makatsang.
I held her gently.	Ke ile ka mo tšoara ka bonolo.
I wondered how he had it.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na o ne a e-na le eona joang.
He had done it now.	O ne a ile a e etsa jwale.
They live very well.	Ba lula hantle haholo.
Obviously they do not.	Ho hlakile hore ha ba etse joalo.
We don't care that.	Ha re tsotelle seo.
He has power in his place.	O na le matla sebakeng sa hae.
Well, it probably did.	Be, mohlomong e entse joalo.
I'm working hard now.	Ke sebetsa ka thata hona joale.
Now we have.	Joale re na le .
We had our chance.	Re bile le monyetla oa rona.
He could no longer do it and refused.	O ne a se a ke ke a hlola a e etsa mme a hana.
We can work here.	Re ka sebetsa mona.
I could not expect to know if he had made a mistake.	Ke ne nke ke ka lebella ho tseba hore na o entse phoso.
I'm fine.	Ke phela hantle.
Is that you? 	Na ke uena eo?
I decided to play him.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho mo bapala.
asked the doctor.	ha botsa ngaka.
You will do whatever you want anyway.	O tla etsa seo o se batlang leha ho le jwalo.
And he would keep it to himself.	'Me o ne a tla boloka eona ho eena.
Many people felt the same way.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
It happens to many.	Ho etsahala ho ba bangata.
He asked if this group could think of that.	O ile a botsa hore na sehlopha sena se ka nahana ka seo.
Well, everything.	Joalo, tsohle.
It's easy to get out, of course.	Ho na le bonolo ho tsoa, ​​ehlile.
That's exactly right.	Ke eona taba hantle feela.
It has been good.	Ho bile molemo.
If you want to do better, you can.	Haeba u batla ho etsa betere, u ka khona.
Their arrival can benefit us.	Ho fihla ha bona ho ka re tsoela molemo.
In the past, it was easy.	Nakong e fetileng, ho ne ho le bonolo.
I really don't know.	Ruri ha ke tsebe.
Then I drove some more.	Eaba ke khanna tse ling hape.
In the future.	Nakong e tlang.
Very nice house.	Ntlo e ntle haholo.
So you can see why the letter is so hard for me.	Kahoo u ka bona hore na ke hobane’ng ha lengolo le le thata ho ’na.
You do not need it.	Ha u e hloke.
There were other people like me.	Ho ne ho e-na le batho ba bang ba tšoanang le ’na.
It was trying.	E ne e leka.
It can be anyone.	E ka ba mang kapa mang.
I would like that.	Ke kopa seo.
He has been looking for this for a long time.	Haesale a batla sena ka nako e telele.
It will take time to get there.	Ho tla nka nako ho fihla moo.
Finally.	Qetellong.
At the time, he did not even speak to her.	Ka nako eo o ne a bile a sa bue le eena.
He did not want to see that.	O ne a sa batle ho bona seo.
I do not know your life.	Ha ke tsebe bophelo ba hau.
He did not notice her.	Ha aa ka a mo hlokomela.
It wasn't too long ago.	E ne e se khale haholo.
There was not enough day.	Ho ne ho se letsatsi le lekaneng.
Think of it that way.	Nahana ka tsela eo.
Thanks for the help!	Re leboha thuso!
You only learn it over time.	U ithuta eona feela ha nako e ntse e ea.
If this is not the case, it is not.	Ha sena se le sieo, ha se sona.
My children love her.	Bana ba ka ba a mo rata.
Now he had found it.	Joale o ne a se a e fumane.
But as long as they are near the road.	Empa ha feela ba le haufi le tsela.
He can't tell you.	A ke ke a o bolella.
That would have to be enough for both of them.	Seo se ne se tla lokela ho lekana bakeng sa bobeli ba bona.
We will go.	Re tla tsamaea.
And then it works.	'Me joale ea sebetsa.
The child learned quickly.	Ngoana o ile a ithuta kapele.
He did not want to look at her again.	O ne a sa batle ho mo sheba hape.
You are nothing to me.	Ha o letho ho nna.
Of course, no one was there.	Ha e le hantle, ho ne ho se na motho.
There is no work after this.	Ha ho na mosebetsi ka mor'a sena.
You may want to get back to this early.	U ka 'na ua batla ho khutlela ho sena pele ho nako.
He studied the room carefully.	O ile a ithuta kamore eo ka hloko.
We may have seen it coming, but we did not.	Mohlomong re ka be re e bone e tla, empa ha rea ​​ka ra e bona.
You have to try hard.	O tlameha ho leka ka matla.
Either way would be better.	Tsela efe kapa efe e ka ba molemo.
This is a very good thing.	Sena ke ntho e ntle haholo.
That is exactly what happened.	Ha e le hantle ke sona se ileng sa etsahala.
I should not have given up on you.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho o tlohela.
You will meet a lot of people.	O tla kopana le batho ba bangata.
Also always.	Le eona kamehla.
And eat breakfast.	Le ho ja lijo tsa hoseng.
He wanted to be a doctor like his father.	O ne a batla ho ba ngaka joaloka ntate oa hae.
It wasn't much.	E ne e se ngata.
But we still do not know how to do this.	Empa re ntse re sa tsebe ho etsa sena.
I mean that.	Ke bolela seo.
Then she started to cry.	Eaba o qala ho lla.
That is a difficult subject.	Ke taba e thata.
And the night before.	Le bosiu pele ho moo.
That's more than any man needs.	Hoo ho feta kamoo monna ofe kapa ofe a hlokang.
There was no letter for me.	Ho ne ho se na lengolo la ka.
I’m not going to talk about that right now, though.	Ha ke sa tlo bua ka taba eo hona joale, leha ho le joalo.
We got there about the same time.	Re ile ra fihla moo hoo e ka bang ka nako e tšoanang.
I understand very well.	Ke utloisisa hantle.
I want to talk.	Ke batla ho bua.
He couldn't have his phone on him.	O ne a ke ke a ba le mohala oa hae ho eena.
It was the only way people could do it.	E ne e le eona feela tsela eo batho ba neng ba ka e etsa.
Because they wanted to make money.	Ke hobane ba ne ba batla ho etsa chelete.
But the teacher will not do it for you.	Empa tichere e ke ke ea u etsetsa eona.
Like us, everyone was well dressed.	Joalo ka rona, batho bohle ba ne ba apere hantle.
You were very understanding.	U ne u utloisisa haholo.
Then they came.	Eaba baa tla.
Without us, the place was empty.	Ntle le rona, sebaka seo se ne se se na letho.
I have to go ahead.	Ke tlameha ho ea pele.
And then again to the end.	Mme hape hape ho ya qetellong.
Doing so later.	Ho etsa joalo ka mor'a.
There is a law.	Ho na le molao.
What we could not do.	Seo re neng re ka se khone ho se etsa.
Nice to see you again.	Ke thabela ho o bona hape.
Maybe they will catch us, maybe not.	Mohlomong ba tla re tšoara, mohlomong che.
Then we got the first one.	Eaba re fumana e 'ngoe ea pele.
Yet you will do so.	Leha ho le joalo u tla etsa joalo.
It looks better than a person.	E shebahala e le ntle ho feta ka motho.
I will not weep.	Nke ke ka lla.
I like it well.	Ke rata hantle.
Over time, people have forgotten the past.	Ha nako e ntse e feta, batho ba ile ba lebala tse fetileng.
He wanted money.	O ne a batla chelete.
A man who never wanted to see her again.	Monna eo ho seng mohla a kileng a batla ho mo bona hape.
So we stayed where we could.	Kahoo re ne re lula moo re neng re ka khona.
Playing all the things you love from yesterday to today.	Ho bapala lintho tsohle tseo u li ratang ho tloha maobane ho fihlela kajeno.
He opens it.	E a e bula.
I know how to use those things.	Ke tseba ho sebelisa lintho tseo.
What would a person who has never been there think?	Motho ea neng a e-s'o be moo o ne a tla nahana'ng?
Like the police today.	Joalo ka mapolesa kajeno.
You will probably earn a lot of money.	E ka 'na eaba u tla fumana chelete e ngata.
That means it is safe.	Ho bolela hore ha ho kotsi.
He has always wanted to go.	Haesale a lakatsa ho tsamaea.
Not the way we think, we are no longer alive.	E seng kamoo re e nahanang, ha re sa phela.
The water is clear today.	Metsi a hlakile kajeno.
He stood up and watched.	A ema mme a shebella.
He slept in a grassy area.	O ile a robala sebakeng se nang le joang.
Maybe he doesn't think of them.	Mohlomong ha a nahane ka bona.
We need more money.	Re hloka chelete e ngata.
What do you wear when you swim?	U apara eng ha u sesa?
And, say.	Mme, ho re.
He must have taken the money.	E tlameha ebe o nkile chelete.
Maybe it's too late now.	Mohlomong joale e se e le morao haholo.
It certainly did that to me.	Ka sebele e entse joalo ho ’na.
He would fall.	O ne a tla oa.
I asked him about it today.	Ke ile ka mo botsa ka eona kajeno.
That year.	Selemong seo.
And one more after that.	Le e 'ngoe ka mor'a moo.
They were very helpful.	Ba ne ba thusa haholo.
You, the stay-at-home mom.	Wena, mme wa ho dula hae.
Those who have more, they want everything.	Ba nang le ho feta, ba batla tsohle.
They are too tall!	Ba telele haholo!
It is difficult to know how he feels.	Ho thata ho tseba hore na o ikutloa joang.
This was what they were.	Sena e ne e le seo ba neng ba le sona.
But you are always alone.	Empa u lula u le mong.
Once more important than money.	Hang bohlokoa ho feta chelete.
I know a lot.	Ke tseba haholo.
She loves working with children, and she loves shopping.	O rata ho sebetsa le bana, mme o rata ho reka.
Probably the easiest way to go.	Mohlomong ke eona tsela e bonolo ka ho fetisisa ea ho tsamaea.
No, it did not.	Che, ha hoa ka ha e-ba joalo.
And tomorrow.	Le hosane.
However, there was something else.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le ntho e ’ngoe hape.
The school offered her a job as a teacher.	Sekolo se ile sa re a ka sebetsa e le tichere.
Here, everyone is his own.	Mona, e mong le e mong ke oa hae.
Or both or not.	Kapa bobeli kapa che.
This is more true today than ever before.	Sena ke ’nete kajeno ho feta leha e le neng pele.
You can stay there.	U ka lula moo.
It could have been more important than you might think.	E ka be e bile ea bohlokoa ho feta kamoo u ka nahanang kateng.
We loved being together.	Re ne re rata ho ba hammoho.
However, here is my question.	Leha ho le joalo, potso ea ka ke ena.
And looking for more people like you.	Le ho batla batho ba bangata ba tšoanang le uena.
Because night is fast approaching.	Hobane bosiu bo tla kapele.
That’s why you need someone who can think ahead.	Ke ka lebaka leo u hlokang motho ea ka nahanang esale pele.
But he did not know.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe.
What you were wearing both.	Seo le neng le se apere ka bobeli.
John was in a good team.	John o ne a le sehlopheng se setle.
This was not the kind of thing he understood very well.	Ena e ne e se mofuta oa ntho eo a neng a e utloisisa hantle.
She knew the young man's feelings.	O ne a tseba maikutlo a mohlankana eo.
I knew that.	Ke ne ke tseba seo.
Ka ????????? 	Ka ?????????
And one more thing.	Le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Before it is too late.	Pele e eba morao haholo.
We will never allow that to happen to us.	Re ke ke ra lumella seo hore le ka mohla re nahane ka sona.
We caught him yesterday.	Re ile ra mo tšoara maobane.
It is time to move on.	Ke nako ea ho tsoela pele ka eona.
I have done it many times.	Ke e entse hangata.
It means you want a baby.	Ho bolela hore o batla ngoana.
It just does that.	E etsa joalo feela.
They are present now.	Ba teng hona joale.
No one else was there.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong ea neng a le teng.
You will see that they are there.	U tla bona hore li teng.
Only he knows the local area.	Ke eena feela ea tsebang sebaka seo sa sebaka.
I enjoy some things now.	Ke thabela lintho tse ling hona joale.
Water is essential to your well-being.	Metsi a bohlokoa bakeng sa ho phela ha hao.
I didn't even try to figure out what he was thinking.	Ha kea ka ka leka le ho nahana hore na o ne a nahana ka eng.
Thank you for what you have done and what you will do.	Kea le leboha ka seo le se entseng le seo le tla se etsa.
Talk about problems.	Bua ka mathata.
You can let it go.	U ka e tlohela.
He would not be wearing it this year.	A ka be a sa e apara selemong sena.
Look and see.	Sheba 'me u bone.
And they would probably need help.	'Me mohlomong ba ne ba tla hloka thuso.
I really enjoyed the party.	Ke ile ka thabela mokete oo haholo.
You have to leave this place, now.	U tlameha ho tloha sebakeng sena, joale.
So we took a look.	Kahoo re ile ra sheba.
He wants to win.	O batla ho hlola.
Don't you think we should go?	Na ha u nahane hore re tsamaee?
I can't drink from you, though.	Ha ke khone ho noa ho tsoa ho uena, leha ho le joalo.
I went alone.	Ke ile ka tsamaea ke le mong.
And all the rest.	Le ba bang kaofela.
Moreover, a letter.	Ho feta moo, lengolo.
But maybe there is another way to come.	Empa mohlomong ho na le tsela e 'ngoe e tlang.
I will make sure of it.	Ke tla etsa bonnete ba eona.
It might be best to finish this tomorrow.	Ho ka ba molemo ho qeta sena hosane.
It was not a refusal to speak.	E ne e se ho hana ho bua.
She must have noticed him and felt happy.	E tlameha ebe o ile a mo hlokomela ’me a ikutloa a thabile.
We work sometimes together.	Re sebetsa ka nako e 'ngoe hammoho.
Look at your picture or picture.	Sheba setšoantšo kapa setšoantšo sa hau.
We do not have to buy.	Ha rea ​​tlameha ho reka.
This is an important rule.	Ona ke molao oa bohlokoa.
She was embarrassed.	O ne a se a le lihlong.
Both seem to work well.	Ka bobeli li bonahala li sebetsa hantle.
I was a boy, I couldn’t do that.	Ke ne ke le moshanyana, ke sa khone ho etsa joalo.
He loved her very much.	O ile a mo rata haholo.
I think they are good.	Ke nahana hore ba molemo.
I didn't like it very much.	Ke ne ke sa e rate haholo.
There is a chance again before next week.	Ho na le monyetla hape pele bekeng e tlang.
Happy times, good times.	Linako tse monate, linako tse monate.
But they could not stay.	Empa ba ne ba sa khone ho lula.
Keep thinking.	Lula u nahana.
We will sleep later.	Re tla robala morao.
A decision is needed.	Ho hlokahala qeto.
There was something he loved about her.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho eo a neng a e rata ka eena.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
Thanks for your feedback !.	Ke leboha maikutlo a hau!.
I will never meet them again.	Ha ke sa tla kopana le bona hape.
Only time will tell.	Ke nako feela e tla bolela.
I would not give them anything.	Ke ne nke ke ka ba fa letho.
As in the old days.	Joalo ka matsatsi a khale.
I thought he was very dangerous.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o kotsi haholo.
That is not his job.	Oo hase mosebetsi oa hae.
You can come.	O ka tla.
He thought that was the worst thing he could do.	A nahana hore hoo e ne e le ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
He finally reached the end of everything.	Qetellong o ile a fihla qetellong ea tsohle.
Do not tell anyone about us.	O se ke wa bolella motho ka rona.
Finally he stood up.	Qetellong a ema.
An important thing.	Ntho ea bohlokoa.
He came home and found the house empty.	O ile a fihla hae a fumana ntlo e se na letho.
We may not be on time.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe ha re sa fihla nakong.
Instead, he loved her.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ne a mo rata.
You do your job.	U etsa mosebetsi oa hau.
Who knows what they will catch.	Ke mang ea tsebang hore na ba tla tšoara eng.
And good news.	Le litaba tse monate.
But now he is talking about his feelings to you.	Empa hona joale o bua ka maikutlo a hae le uena.
He does a good job.	O etsa mosebetsi o motle.
Where do you think the baby is?	U nahana hore ngoana o hokae?
I don't know what to do.	Ha ke tsebe seo nka se etsang.
It would be for.	E ne e tla ba bakeng sa.
I have always worked.	Haesale ke sebetsa.
He loves you.	O a o rata.
I made a mistake.	Ke entse phoso.
We have the benefit of looking back.	Re na le molemo oa ho sheba morao.
I was not sleeping.	Ke ne ke sa robala.
But before that, nothing.	Empa pele ho moo, ha ho letho.
They were already very tall.	Ba ne ba se ba le telele haholo.
He was done.	O ne o qetile.
She finds it hard to get enough sleep.	O fumana ho le thata ho robala ka ho lekaneng.
Yes, there are problems with the law.	E, ho na le mathata ka molao.
He will make whatever decision is best for him.	O tla etsa qeto efe kapa efe e molemo bakeng sa hae.
Now, everybody is happy.	Jwale, bohle ba thabile.
I really don't care.	Ruri ha ke tsotelle.
No one did anything.	Ha ho motho ea entseng letho.
But no, no.	Empa che, ha ho na.
Not everyone but that is not the case.	Hase bohle empa ha se taba eo.
He looks very good.	O shebahala hantle haholo.
True to have.	'Nete ho ba le.
Maybe someone else.	Mohlomong ho na le motho e mong.
So obviously you were there.	Kahoo ho hlakile hore u bile teng.
Just stay right.	Dula hantle feela.
We can make space.	Re ka etsa sebaka.
They have to work.	Ba tlameha ho sebetsa.
I saw the name but did not think of it.	Ke ile ka bona lebitso leo empa ke sa nahane letho ka lona.
We take anyone present.	Re nka mang kapa mang ea teng.
There was none of these things.	Ho ne ho se le e 'ngoe ea lintho tsena.
You are not sure how to proceed.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na u ka tsoela pele joang.
Keep up the good work.	Tsoela pele hantle.
Do not trust any of them.	U se ke ua tšepa le ea mong oa bona.
Our dog was happy all the time.	Ntja ea rona e ne e thabile ka nako eohle.
You have to look at everyone.	U tlameha ho sheba motho e mong le e mong.
High altitude.	Sebaka se phahameng.
It was hard to say.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bua.
Not many.	Ha li ngata.
We'll hear from you as long as you're in the area.	Re tla u utloa ha feela u ntse u le sebakeng.
It would have been a huge undertaking for him.	E ka be e bile mosebetsi o moholo ho eena.
This is what life was all about.	Sena ke sona seo bophelo bo neng bo le sona.
That's just the beginning.	Ke ho qala feela.
He knows a lot.	O tseba haholo.
These people have many children.	Batho bana ba na le bana ba bangata.
I will be equal to you.	Ke tla lekana le uena.
They both are seeing.	Ka bobeli ba ntse ba bona.
The young man said he loved her.	Mohlankana eo o ile a re oa mo rata.
Everyone loved him, see.	Bohle ba ne ba mo rata, le a bona.
How to go with the whole book !.	Tsela ea ho tsamaea le buka eohle!.
No, there is no point in that.	Che, haho thuso ho seo.
We hope this helps.	Rea tšepa hore sena sea thusa.
Just having it.	Ho ba le eona feela.
You do not have to tell them.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u ba bolelle.
I will not trust what you say.	Ha ke na ho tšepa seo u se buang.
It's just a problem.	Ke bothata feela.
Please comment.	Ka kopo fana ka maikutlo a hau.
If they think they are your friends, they will still call you.	Haeba ba nahana hore ke metsoalle ea hao, ba ntse ba tla u letsetsa.
We can do it again if we want to.	Re ka e etsa hape haeba re batla.
He was there.	O ne a le teng.
I should not have lived to this day.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho phela ho fihlela kajeno.
It just makes it so.	E etsa hore ho be jwalo feela.
I was expecting	Ke ne ke lebeletse
We need to fix the time.	Re hloka ho lokisa nako.
But it is important, so it is important.	Empa ke ea bohlokoa, kahoo ke ea bohlokoa.
You will take too much room.	O tla nka kamore e ngata haholo.
It was one of the best.	E ne e le e 'ngoe ea tse molemo ka ho fetisisa.
My family life is very good.	Bophelo ba lelapa la ka bo molemo haholo.
There is probably one important reason for this.	Mohlomong ho na le lebaka le le leng la bohlokoa la sena.
Do not decide.	U se ke ua etsa qeto.
So no one is coming.	Kahoo ha ho motho ea tla.
I will continue to help you there.	Ke tla tsoela pele ho u thusa moo.
I had no idea it would.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore e tla etsa joalo.
This is not my life.	Sena ha se bophelo ba ka.
You are not returning.	Ha u sa khutla.
What we did not know.	Hore na ke eng re ne re sa tsebe.
It worked or it didn't work.	E ile ea sebetsa kapa ha ea ka ea sebetsa.
It was an amazingly powerful idea.	E ne e le mohopolo o matla ka tsela e makatsang.
I'm still trying to figure out why he did that.	Ke ntse ke leka ho utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha a entse joalo.
That's him.	Ke eena.
You can't say the same to them right now.	U ke ke ua bua se tšoanang ho bona hona joale.
They are very fun together.	Li monate haholo hammoho.
Entering the woman.	Ho kena mosali.
And it was beautiful.	'Me e ne e le ntle.
He thought he wanted the same thing he had done.	O ne a nahana hore o batla ntho e tšoanang le eo a e entseng.
He sat alone at the party.	O ile a lula a le mong moketeng.
But he did it.	Empa o e entse.
And there are many more.	Mme ho na le tse ngata.
It was stuff.	E ne e le lintho.
I saw each of them pass me by.	Ke ile ka bona e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe ea tsona e feta ho ’na.
It's in a good place.	E sebakeng se setle.
No problem with that.	Haho bothata ka seo.
We do not know who he really is.	Hore na e ka ba mang ha e le hantle ha re tsebe.
He thought he probably needed it.	O ne a nahana hore mohlomong oa e hloka.
I could not keep them.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho li boloka.
You need to know.	O lokela ho tseba.
Do not drink too much coffee.	U se ke ua noa kofi e ngata haholo.
We must do the same.	Re tlameha ho etsa se tšoanang.
You know him.	Ua mo tseba.
But we must.	Empa re tlameha.
I'm not sure what that is, right.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore seo ke eng, hantle.
It came in.	Ya kena.
People will forget what happened here today.	Batho ba tla lebala se etsahetseng mona kajeno.
I think my kids might like this.	Ke nahana hore bana ba ka ba ka rata sena.
He had to start living his life.	O ne a lokela ho qala ho phela bophelo ba hae.
Try to imagine how you did that.	Leka ho nahana hore na u entse seo joang.
He did not know what to do next.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng hape.
We've been there a long time.	Re bile moo nako e telele.
To be, or not to be.	Ho ba, kapa ho se be.
However, he doesn’t talk much about her, or much.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a bue haholo ka eena, kapa haholo.
Everything you can have will be hard to find.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo u ka bang le eona e tla ba thata ho e fumana.
Mental and cognitive thing.	Ntho ya kelello le ya ho tseba.
It was the most amazing thing.	E bile ntho e makatsang ka ho fetisisa.
We do not want to see that happen to you.	Ha re batle ho bona seo se etsahala ho uena.
He had no idea.	O ne a sena maikutlo.
Now, we have the first one.	Joale, re na le ea pele.
He certainly did not.	Ka sebele ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
We can't talk to him.	Ha re khone ho bua le eena.
That's how he is with me.	Ke kamoo a nang le 'na kateng.
He did not notice.	Ha a ka a hlokomela.
The strange thing is that.	Taba e makatsang ke hore.
Eating well, of course.	Ho ja hantle, ehlile.
Over time, you think of everything.	Ha nako e ntse e ea, u nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
I knew what you wanted.	Ke ne ke tseba seo u se batlang.
I do not believe.	ha ke lumele.
They seemed to be waiting for us.	Ba ne ba bonahala ba re emetse.
It will not help but be.	Ho ke ke ha thusa empa ho ba joalo.
The others sat down.	Ba bang ba ile ba lula fatše.
But he tries to come to me.	Empa o leka ho tla ho nna.
He is still there.	O ntse a le teng.
I didn't have to do anything.	Ha kea tlameha ho etsa letho.
Of course we have to go to that.	Ha e le hantle re lokela ho ea ho seo.
Both of you were much better.	Lona ka bobeli le ne le le betere haholo.
I never thought he would do something like that.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore a ka etsa ntho e kang eo.
Her husband.	Monna oa hae.
Just a matter of working on it now.	Feela taba ea ho e sebetsa hona joale.
I didn’t even know it was still there.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe le hore e ntse e le teng.
They lived a good life there.	Ba ne ba phela bophelo bo monate moo.
No, he did not.	Che, o ne a sa ka a etsa joalo.
We were afraid that this would happen.	Re ne re tšaba hore sena se tla etsahala.
It was too close for too many.	E ne e le haufi haholo bakeng sa ba bangata haholo.
As a player.	E le sebapali.
Don't cry too much about it.	U se ke ua lla haholo ka eona.
He looked at the picture of his father.	A sheba setšoantšo sa ntate oa hae.
They did not find it.	Ha baa ka ba e fumana.
Then at the end of the week, nothing.	Ebe qetellong ea beke, ha ho letho.
I thought you might know.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o ka tseba.
I needed time to think it over.	Ke ne ke hloka nako ea ho e nahana hantle.
Here is the point.	Taba ke ena.
Something powerful.	Ntho ea matla.
I just stared.	Ke ile ka sheba feela.
I would not say that it is because of this.	Ke ne nke ke ka bolela hore ke ka lebaka la taba ena.
Sometimes you just have to stop and see how you feel.	Ka linako tse ling u tlameha ho ema 'me u bone hore na u ikutloa joang.
You can work where you want and when you want.	U ka sebetsa moo u batlang le ka nako eo u batlang.
All you have to do is stand up.	Seo u lokelang ho se etsa ke ho ema.
These are the times that are real life for me.	Tsena ke linako tseo e leng bophelo ba sebele ho 'na.
And you know it, too.	Mme o a e tseba, hape.
He opened it and went inside.	A e bula a kena.
But we loved him.	Empa re ne re mo rata.
They don't even talk about it.	Ha ba bue le ka taba eo.
I'm tired.	Ke khathetse.
A lot of things would be fun.	Lintho tse ngata li ne li tla ba monate.
They worked harder.	Ba ile ba sebetsa ka thata ho feta.
I'm almost happy.	Ke batla ke thabile.
Gently return to your starting position.	Ka bonolo khutlela sebakeng sa hau sa ho qala.
No, there is no such food.	Che, ha ho lijo tseo.
And many more when the children can be home.	Le tse ling tse ngata ha bana ba ka ba le hae.
I love how you make me want to be a better man.	Ke rata kamoo o etsang hore ke batle ho ba monna ea betere.
It had taken too long.	E ne e nkile nako e telele haholo.
There seems to be no way to ask for it.	Ho bonahala ho se mokhoa oa ho e kōpa.
Anyone can do it.	Mang kapa mang a ka e etsa.
Because they made a mistake.	Hobane ba entse phoso.
I'll be here, whatever happens.	Ke tla ba mona, eng kapa eng e etsahalang.
It seems to be waiting for something.	Eka e emetse ho hong.
It was clear he was in pain.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore o ne a utloile bohloko.
But eventually they would all leave.	Empa qetellong kaofela ba ne ba tla tsamaea.
Then he made another one.	Eaba o etsa e 'ngoe.
You would not cry for that.	O ne o sa tlo lla ka seo.
He lived there.	O ne a lula moo.
The years have been difficult for him.	Lilemo li bile boima ho eena.
Just the way he wanted it.	Feela ka tsela eo a neng a e batla ka eona.
It didn't matter, really.	Ho ne ho se na taba, ruri.
He tried to refuse.	A leka ho hana.
Last week nothing happened.	Bekeng e fetileng ha ho letho le etsahetseng.
He is not really a member of the team.	Ha e le hantle ha se motho oa sehlopha.
But even that was not enough.	Empa le hoo ho ne ho sa lekana.
It just tells us that you are.	E re bolella feela hore le.
You would think that sometime.	U ne u tla nahana hore ka nako e 'ngoe.
It is a good thing, not a bad thing.	Ke ntho e ntle, e seng e mpe.
So that is what happens.	Kahoo ke sona se etsahalang.
He knew how that felt.	O ne a tseba hore na seo se ne se ikutloa joang.
And, we had a great time.	'Me, re ne re e-na le nako e monate.
We had enough to eat.	Re ne re e-na le lijo tse lekaneng.
Maybe there is.	Mohlomong ho na le.
You just have to stop sometimes.	U tlameha feela ho ema ka linako tse ling.
Eventually he will love you.	Qetellong o tla u rata.
I hear things.	Ke utloa lintho.
He must have gone back to his room.	E tlameha ebe o ile a khutlela kamoreng ea hae.
Of course he would cry like a baby.	Ehlile o ne a tla lla joalo ka ngoana.
There is no other chance.	Ha ho na monyetla o mong.
It will not go away quickly.	E ke ke ea tloha kapele.
It belonged to someone else.	E ne e le tsa motho e mong.
That assumes it may be wrong.	Seo se nka hore mohlomong ke phoso.
It's not my style.	Ha se mokhoa oa ka.
I wanted to see if anyone would tell me first.	Ke ne ke batla ho bona hore na ho na le motho ea tla mpolella pele.
He loved everyone and everyone loved him too.	O ne a rata bohle mme bohle ba mo rata le bona.
She started to cry again.	A qala ho lla hape.
Others look at him.	Ba bang ba mo sheba.
I do not.	Ha ke.
He is no longer alive.	Ha a sa phela.
The children were happy.	Bana ba ne ba thabile.
It may be his favorite thing to do.	E ka 'na eaba ke seo a se ratang haholo.
One thing for sure.	Ntho e le 'ngoe ka 'nete.
Or you want to have your own family.	Kapa u batla ho ba le lelapa la hau.
Look at the picture.	Sheba setšoantšo sena.
Something, of course, is very bad.	Ntho e 'ngoe, ehlile, e mpe haholo.
He was ahead of his time.	O ne a le ka pele ho nako ea hae.
But that does not matter.	Empa hoo ke ntle le taba.
However, it is not a bad thing.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se ntho e mpe.
We certainly know that now.	Ruri re tseba seo jwale.
He would not want to live.	O ne a ke ke a batla ho phela.
That you fall.	Hore u oa.
Go back outside.	Khutlela ka ntle.
And now you.	Mme jwale wena.
He was a teacher.	E ne e le tichere.
Nobody there.	Haho motho moo.
It starts to move.	E qala ho tsamaea.
Good idea.	Mohopolo o motle.
And he came.	Mme o ne a tla.
But they got it.	Empa ba o fumana.
This book is the only one and it does it well.	Buka ena ke eona feela 'me e e etsa hantle.
But we tried.	Empa re ile ra leka.
With their own hands.	Ka matsoho a bona.
And something else.	Le ntho e 'ngoe.
We trust you.	Rea u tšepa.
To help and to help.	Ho thusa le ho thusa.
You would be better off.	U ka be u le betere.
I decide to let her go.	Ke etsa qeto ea ho mo tlohela.
We made no mistake.	Ha rea ​​etsa phoso.
I talk a lot about hair.	Ke bua ka moriri haholo.
Nor should it.	Hape ha ea lokela ho ba joalo.
She started to cry again.	A qala ho lla hape.
I hope you enjoy it !.	Kea tšepa u tla e thabela!.
It was so beautiful.	E ne e le ntle haholo.
We did not get water.	Ha rea ​​fumana metsi.
You can too.	Le uena u ka khona.
I felt something was wrong.	Ke ile ka utloa hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
A nice house with lots of room.	Ntlo e ntle e nang le kamore e ngata.
But he has an idea.	Empa o na le mohopolo.
I did not ask him about it.	Ha kea ka ka mo botsa ka eona.
Because that is what will happen.	Hobane ke sona se tla etsahala.
Until things do not go well.	Ho fihlela lintho li sa tsamaee hantle.
We all know that it is very important to reuse.	Kaofela rea ​​tseba hore ho bohlokoa haholo ho sebelisa hape.
She tried to help the child.	O ile a leka ho thusa ngoana.
He'll be done after that.	O tla be a qetile ka mor'a moo.
You did not work well.	Ha ua sebetsa hantle.
Never let them allow themselves to get what they want will be easy.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua ba lumella ho lumela ho fumana seo ba se batlang ho tla ba bonolo.
But it was a good idea.	Empa e ne e le mohopolo o monate.
But they paid well and on time.	Empa ba ile ba lefa hantle le ka nako.
That did just that.	Seo se ile sa etsa joalo.
He will leave.	O tla tloha.
I would not like anything.	Nka se rate letho.
I took a few things from you.	Ke nkile lintho tse 'maloa ho uena.
And sometimes.	'Me ka linako tse ling.
I can, however.	Nka khona, leha ho le joalo.
They suggested helping to hear what others were saying.	Ba ile ba etsa tlhahiso ea ho thusa ho utloa seo ba bang ba se buang.
Also, it is not true.	Hape, ha se 'nete.
So very, very good.	Kahoo haholo, hantle haholo.
I have to leave here for myself.	Ke tlameha ho tloha mona bakeng sa ka.
And each day he lived longer.	Mme letsatsi le letsatsi o ne a dula nako e telele.
That, notice, is one thing.	Seo, hlokomela, ke taba e le 'ngoe.
But that was not exactly what was happening here.	Empa e ne e se sona hantle se neng se etsahala mona.
This is just a legal question.	Ena ke potso ea molao feela.
I met my husband.	Ke kopane le monna oa ka.
I did not see him coming.	Ha kea ka ka bona eo a tlang.
I need help right away.	Ke hloka thuso kapele.
The doctor was not really a doctor.	Ngaka e ne e hlile e se ngaka.
However nothing came back.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho letho le ileng la khutla.
I could not sleep.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho robala.
My father died.	Ntate o ile a hlokahala.
You will have to pay.	U tla tlameha ho lefa.
He was very busy.	O ne a phathahane haholo.
Sometimes people have a hard time believing what someone else thinks.	Ka linako tse ling batho ba na le bothata ba ho lumela maikutlo a motho e mong.
You see, it's easy.	O ya bona, ho bonolo.
It was a week of forgetfulness.	E ne e le beke ea ho lebala.
We are a good team.	Re sehlopha se setle.
However, it is not easy to find it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho bonolo ho e fumana.
But we understand it.	Empa rea ​​e utloisisa.
I think every day should be yours.	Ke nahana hore letsatsi le letsatsi e lokela ho ba ea hau.
Love someone, love something.	Rata motho, rata ntho e itseng.
And they certainly did not seem to matter.	'Me ka sebele li ne li bonahala li se na thuso.
I know what your situation is,.	Kea tseba hore na boemo ba hau bo joang,.
But it did not.	Empa ha ea ka ea etsa joalo.
He has his own way of doing it.	O na le mokhoa oa hae oa ho e etsa.
The child is the father of the man, perhaps.	Ngoana ke ntate oa monna, mohlomong.
Well, very much so.	Joalo, haholo.
I know nothing about you.	Ha ke tsebe letho ka wena.
He will win it, or he will refuse.	O tla e hlola, kapa a hana.
We can still move fast.	Re ntse re ka tsoela pele kapele.
He was working hard!	O ne a ntse a sebetsa ka thata!
It always hurts.	Ho bohloko kamehla.
Traveling will benefit you.	Ho tsamaea ho tla u tsoela molemo.
It is not a matter of doing exactly the same thing you have always done.	Ha se taba ea ho etsa ntho e tšoanang hantle le eo esale u e etsa.
He was finally home!	Qetellong o ne a le hae!
This is important to me.	Sena se bohlokoa ho 'na.
They are indeed dangerous.	Ka sebele li kotsi.
My wife always tells me not to keep it there.	Mosali oa ka o lula a mpolella hore ke se ke ka e boloka moo.
This can be good for you.	Sena se ka ba hantle ho uena.
There is no way, no way.	Feela haho tsela, haho tsela.
The day was gone.	Letsatsi le ne le se le ile.
And things like that.	Le lintho tse kang tseo.
Please buy a book.	Ka kopo, reka buka.
Think of it.	E nahane.
No one was around.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a le haufi le eena.
This is very important.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa haholo.
No problem there.	Haho bothata moo.
I knew he was joking, but I never heard him.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o bapala, empa ha ke so ka ke mo utloa.
However, we say.	Leha ho le joalo, re re.
We are not children.	Ha re bana.
It was time to leave.	E ne e le nako ea ho tsamaea.
Lots of things to talk about.	Lintho tse ngata tseo u ka buang ka tsona.
All the news is bad.	Litaba tsohle li mpe.
I hope it will be so.	Ke tšepa hore e tla ba joalo.
There is nothing better than a good night's sleep.	Ha ho letho le molemo ho feta ho robala hantle bosiu.
is that possible.	na hoo ho ka etsahala.
And it happened that way.	Mme ho ile ha etsahala ka tsela eo.
They do not know that it exists.	Ha ba tsebe hore e teng.
Last year.	Selemong se fetileng.
Was it really necessary to open the door?	Na ho ne ho hlile ho hlokahala ho bula lemati?
The question is how effective these are.	Potso ke hore na tsena li sebetsa hakae.
I'll see you tonight.	Ke tla le bona bosiung bona.
Now it is just a thought.	Hona joale e se e le mohopolo feela.
This is good news.	Tsena ke litaba tse monate.
Anything this dog wanted, it was his.	Ntho efe kapa efe eo ntja ena e neng e e batla, e ne e le ea hae.
You need help.	U hloka thuso.
I can start it.	Nka khona ho e qala.
Then they went.	Joale ba ile.
That is exactly what was happening.	Ke sona hantle se neng se etsahala.
I am not.	Ha ke eena.
He looked at the picture of his wife and child.	O ile a sheba setšoantšo sa mosali oa hae le ngoana.
He was even worse.	O ne a le mpe le ho feta.
Just enter right.	Kena hantle feela.
I see no reason for it.	Ha ke bone lebaka le itseng la hona.
This is but.	Sena ke empa.
To many.	Ho tse ngata.
It wasn't him.	E ne e se eena.
There is no time for that now.	Ha ho nako ea seo hona joale.
It was not fun.	Ho ne ho se monate.
She is doing well.	O ntse o sebetsa hantle.
That was not the question.	E ne e se potso eo.
I often see people reading as I walk.	Hangata ke bona batho ba bala ha ke ntse ke tsamaea.
And this works.	'Me sena se sebetsa.
The problem with that is that it is obvious.	Bothata ba seo ke hore ho hlakile.
It doesn't matter.	Ha e tsotelle letho.
Get out of my room! 	Tloha ka kamoreng ea ka!
Times are hard.	Linako li thata.
I could not understand what he was doing.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho utloisisa seo a se etsang.
All too much.	Tsohle tse ngata haholo.
We let her go before she did.	Re ile ra mo tlohela pele a etsa joalo.
And we did not.	Mme ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
None of them have ever been here.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea kileng a fihla mona.
There is no room.	Haho sebaka.
And they know what life was like for him.	'Me baa tseba hore na bophelo bo ne bo le joang le eena.
The ceremony lasted several days.	Mokete oo o ile oa nka matsatsi a ’maloa.
I didn't care about the danger.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle kotsi.
In the area.	Sebakeng.
He wanted to live a good life.	O ne a lakatsa ho phela bophelo bo monate.
The important thing is that they start well.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore ba qala hantle.
This makes me want to go back and read this article.	Sena se etsa hore ke batle ho khutlela morao ho ea bala taba ena.
We are here.	Re ka mona.
And it is very important to understand.	'Me ho bohlokoa haholo ho utloisisa.
He was too big.	O ne a le moholo haholo.
I have never seen anything like it before.	Ha ke eso bone e kang eo pele.
Sometimes it worked well.	Ka linako tse ling e ne e sebetsa hantle.
I'll take this.	Ke tla e thabela.
Go for it.	Etsa joalo.
And they were there, for a while.	Mme ba ne ba le teng, ka nako e itseng.
This was good news.	Tsena e ne e le litaba tse monate.
What you think is true.	Seo u se nahanang ke 'nete.
All my friends will be able to come and stay.	Metsoalle ea ka kaofela e tla khona ho tla ho lula.
I read this three times.	Ke ile ka bala ena ka makhetlo a mararo.
Then he could not walk.	Eaba o se a sitoa ho tsamaea.
He still has plenty of time.	O ntse a e-na le nako e ngata.
They are still human.	E ntse e le batho.
Unless you want to.	Ntle le haeba o batla.
He also says 'nothing'.	Hape o re 'ha ho letho'.
I just wanted to see.	Ke ne ke batla ho bona feela.
His car, no.	Koloi ea hae, che.
When he feels tired, he sits down.	Ha a ikutloa a khathetse, a lula fatše.
I have a lot of books here.	Ke na le libuka tse ngata mona.
You can stay here if you want.	U ka lula mona ha u batla.
He thought it was something.	O ne a nahana hore ke ho hong.
He is the only boy in the room.	Ke moshanyana a le mong ka phaposing eo.
I needed you there.	Ke ne ke u hloka moo.
We found a place.	Re fumane sebaka.
He will fall.	O tla oa.
He never had a chance to drive it.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba le monyetla oa ho e khanna .
We went well at work.	Re ile ra ea hantle mosebetsing.
Here is what you will do.	Mona ke seo u tlang ho se etsa.
I have a driver's license.	Ke na le lengolo la ho khanna.
I have seen a very good job.	Ke bone mosebetsi o motle haholo.
This is not your business.	Sena ha se taba ea hau.
But he did not go on.	Empa ha aa ka a tsoela pele.
I did it three years ago.	Ke e entse lilemo tse tharo tse fetileng.
So we met for coffee.	Kahoo re ne re kopana bakeng sa kofi.
It's a good job.	Ke mosebetsi o motle.
You must decide.	E tlameha ebe ke uena ea etsang qeto.
I always refuse.	Ke hana kamehla.
He can't walk.	Ha a khone ho tsamaea.
It will be a wonderful day.	E tla ba letsatsi le monate.
And it's very simple, of course.	'Me e bonolo haholo, ehlile.
In real time.	Ka nako ya sebele.
Obviously there is something wrong here.	Ho hlakile hore ho na le phoso mona.
We thank them.	Rea ba leboha.
That was my job.	Oo e ne e le mosebetsi oa ka.
So the people leave and go out at night.	Kahoo batho ba tloha moo ’me ba tsoa bosiu.
We are your family now.	Re lelapa la hao hona joale.
And he did not do so well.	Mme ha a ka a etsa mosebetsi o motle hakaalo.
Which he never did!	E leng seo a sa kang a se etsa!
He was so happy!	O ne a thabile haholo!
Look, it comes with a place.	Sheba, e tla le sebaka.
Just stay home.	Dula hae feela.
Anything could be better than this.	Ntho efe kapa efe e ka ba betere ho feta ena.
No one had ever done this before.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a mo etsa sena pele.
Who he had heard of.	Eo a kileng a e utloa.
They will never fit well.	Ha ho mohla li tla lekana hantle.
I didn't want to do it now.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho e etsa jwale.
Here are some of the strangest things for me.	Mona ke lintho tse ling tse makatsang ho nna.
It's close.	E haufi.
They were simply absent.	Ba ne ba le sieo feela.
Please get help.	Ka kopo fumana thuso.
You can be bigger than you think.	O ka ba moholo ho feta kamoo o nahanang.
Anyone can see what it is.	Motho e mong le e mong a ka bona seo e leng sona.
I will study very hard.	Ke tla ithuta ka thata haholo.
Yet it seems you have not yet done so.	Leha ho le joalo ho bonahala eka ha u so etse joalo.
I did not like to do this.	Ke ne ke sa rate ho etsa sena.
They can't find their way.	Ha ba khone ho fumana tsela ea bona.
No comments.	Ha ho na maikutlo.
In fact, you are the first one.	Ha e le hantle, ke uena oa pele.
Some of them.	Ba bang ba bona .
We are not talking about all that.	Ha re bue ka taba eo kaofela.
'life.	' bophelo.
I had to do that.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho etsa joalo.
Never speak without thinking.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua bua ntle le ho nahana.
None of them said anything.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ileng a bua letho.
But it would not happen.	Empa e ne e ke ke ea etsahala.
Lots of people.	Batho ba bangata.
They do what people want.	Ba etsa ntho eo batho ba e batlang.
The important thing was to keep writing.	Ntho ea bohlokoa e ne e le ho tsoela pele ho ngola.
Even though they do.	Leha ba etsa joalo.
We really did not know what we were doing.	Re ne re hlile re sa tsebe seo re se etsang.
You have to think about how bad it is.	U tlameha ho nahana hore na e mpe hakae.
I am reading a good book.	Ke bala buka e monate.
I do not know who he is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o mang.
But we must keep them here.	Empa re tlameha ho li boloka mona.
A great way to get there and back.	Mokhoa o motle oa ho fihla moo le ho khutla.
Probably a lot of them.	Mohlomong tse ngata tsa tsona.
This weight left me.	Boima bona bo ile ba tloha ho 'na.
And that is better than anything anyone else does.	Mme seo se betere ho feta eng kapa eng eo motho e mong a e etsang.
I am useless to find anything on my own.	Ha ke na thuso ho fumana letho ke le mong.
I did not know him very well.	Ke ne ke sa mo tsebe hakaalo.
Now is the time to plan.	Joale ke nako ea ho rera.
That is a family rule.	Seo ke molao oa lelapa.
Thanks again for your help !.	Ke leboha hape ka thuso ea hau!.
They made him a place to sleep.	Ba ne ba mo etsetsa sebaka sa ho robala.
That their condition can.	Hore boemo ba bona bo ka.
Things could have been worse.	Lintho li ka be li bile mpe le ho feta.
Take a picture of me before you leave.	Nka setšoantšo sa ka pele u tsamaea.
Maybe sometime.	Mohlomong ka nako e 'ngoe.
We can do it our way.	Re ka e etsa ka tsela ea rona.
His family would take care of him.	Lelapa la hae le ne le tla mo hlokomela.
What are you trying to find.	U leka ho fumana eng.
But it is probably not as difficult as it seems.	Empa mohlomong ha ho thata joalo ka ha ho bonahala.
How do you feel now?	U ikutloa joang hona joale?
That's why they have parents.	Ke kahoo ba nang le batsoali.
Clearly, he did not expect such news.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a sa lebella litaba tseo.
Know that this is the time to give.	Tseba hore ena ke nako ea ho fana.
I do not like to swim.	Ha ke rate ho sesa.
He was not dangerous to himself or to anyone.	O ne a se kotsi ho eena kapa ho mang kapa mang.
They never used it.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba e sebelisa.
I thought it was you.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke uena.
He can't go out without them.	A ke ke a tsoela ka ntle ntle le tsona.
That did not seem so bad.	Seo se ne se sa bonahale se le mpe hakaalo.
If that is the question.	Haeba ke potso eo.
He was still there.	O ne a ntse a le teng.
I'm sure you can't give anything away.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ha o khone ho fana ka letho.
That would be a good thing.	Seo e ka ba ntho e ntle.
The truth at the end.	'Nete qetellong.
So treat each day with them as if it were your last.	Kahoo tšoara letsatsi le leng le le leng le bona joalo ka ha eka ke la ho qetela.
I will go there.	Ke tla ea moo.
He just suffered.	O ile a utloa bohloko feela.
I'm sorry about that.	Ke masoabi ka seo.
This was about three times as many.	Sena se ne se le ngata haholo ka makhetlo a ka bang mararo.
Know.	Tseba.
This is not the way it should be.	Ena ha se tsela eo e lokelang ho ba ka eona.
But they should not be.	Empa ha ba a lokela ho ba jwalo.
Everyone has to go.	E mong le e mong o tlameha ho tsamaea.
I will take care of her.	Ke tla mo hlokomela.
There is something else you need to do.	Ho na le ntho e 'ngoe eo u lokelang ho e etsa.
One of the stupid things you do.	E 'ngoe ea lintho tse hlokang kelello tseo u li etsang.
Only dinner with a nearby family.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea feela le lelapa le haufi.
What kind of mind I have.	Kelello ea ka ea mofuta ofe.
But that will never happen again.	Empa hoo ho ke ke ha etsahala hape.
Life goes on .	Bophelo bo tsoela pele .
I already feel better.	Ke se ke ikutloa ke le betere.
We do not know enough about what is going on.	Ha re tsebe ho lekana ka se etsahalang.
I do not see the need to talk.	Ha ke bone molemo oa ho bua.
I wanted to talk to you.	Ke ne ke batla ho bua le wena.
After that.	Ka mor'a moo.
I need it urgently.	Ke e hloka kapele.
I hope you are doing well.	Ke tšepa hore u sebetsa hantle.
You know what it is.	Ua tseba hore na ke eng.
He knew how to do it very well.	O ne a tseba ho etsa joalo haholo.
You can try, but you can't do it.	U ka leka, empa u ke ke ua e etsa.
Maybe now we can do something.	Mohlomong joale re ka etsa ho hong.
He joined us.	O ile a kena ho rona.
There is no sense in it.	Ha ho na kelello ho eona.
Tomorrow will start soon.	Hosane ho tla qala kapele.
That they know exactly, well.	Ke hore ba tseba hantle, hantle.
Have you decided where you will go this year?	Na u se u entse qeto ea hore na u tla ea hokae selemong see?
I need to work on them more.	Ke hloka ho sebetsa ho tsona ho feta.
I have never had it.	Ha ke e-so be le eona.
And again and again and again.	Le hape le hape le hape le hape.
He probably did not know that either.	Mohlomong le eena o ne a sa tsebe seo.
I felt like it was the way to be me again.	Ke ne ke utloa eka ke tsela ea ho ba 'na hape.
But it really did not happen.	Empa ha e le hantle ha ea ka ea etsahala.
You can use me to find him.	U ka sebelisa 'na ho mo fumana.
But she may have cried.	Empa e ka ’na eaba o ile a lla.
I go on, asking him question after question.	Ke tsoela pele, ke mo botsa potso ka mor'a potso.
I have to hold these for the police.	Ke tlameha ho tšoara tsena bakeng sa mapolesa.
Indeed, they have.	Ka sebele, ba entse joalo.
He wanted to use her.	O ne a batla ho mo sebelisa.
People do not think about it.	Batho ha ba nahane ka eona.
You did.	U entseng.
I know it's not easy for any of you.	Ke a tseba ha ho bonolo ho mang kapa mang wa lona.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
They are not.	Ha ba joalo.
He knew what to expect.	O ne a tseba seo a lokelang ho se lebella.
Which is what he can do.	E leng seo a ka se khonang.
She looked at her boyfriend.	A sheba mohlankana oa hae.
I will do it.	Ke tla e etsa.
Obviously this is not the case.	Ho hlakile hore sena ha se joalo.
Just right.	Hantle feela.
Enter the room.	Kena ka phaposing.
One of them was.	E mong oa bona e ne e le.
The man falls.	Monna oa oa.
It's not that easy.	Ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
Try your family.	Leka lelapa la hao.
This he cannot do.	Sena ha a khone ho se etsa.
It seemed more powerful.	E ne e bonahala e le matla haholoanyane.
His mind and hands were busy.	Kelello le matsoho a hae a ne a phathahane.
It says to let you go.	E re ho u tlohela.
And space.	Le sebaka.
It starts with us.	E qala ka rona.
We certainly do not see anything wrong with this picture.	Ka 'nete ha re bone letho le phoso ka setšoantšo sena.
They will always start another idea.	Ba tla lula ba qala mohopolo o mong.
You know they have to be there for you.	Ua tseba hore ba tlameha ho ba teng bakeng sa hau.
No one saw.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a bona.
Someone was in the room.	Motho e mong o ne a le ka phaposing.
Books are our friends.	Libuka ke metsoalle ea rona.
It would not have happened to me.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha etsahala ho 'na.
Is it important?	Na ke ea bohlokoa?
He wrote a lot at night.	O ne a ngola haholo bosiu.
I want to know what it is.	Ke batla ho tseba hore na ke eng.
Or you may have thought that you did.	Kapa u ne u nahana hore u entse joalo.
But then nothing happened.	Empa joale ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala.
Some people do not.	Batho ba bang ha ba etse joalo.
That decision was a mistake.	Qeto eo e bile phoso.
Then they took him.	Eaba ba mo nka.
I did not know.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe.
And it did not.	'Me ha hoa ka ha e-ba joalo.
Her father gives her the money, and she leaves.	Ntate oa hae o mo fa chelete, 'me oa tsamaea.
Sometimes you just have to walk.	Ka linako tse ling u hloka ho tsamaea.
I still did not know what that thing was.	Ke ne ke ntse ke sa tsebe hore na ntho eo ke efe.
The fact that it did not matter.	Taba ea hore ha ea ka ea e-ba ea bohlokoa.
But if we go fast, we do not have to.	Empa haeba re tsamaea kapele, ha ho hlokahale hore re etse joalo.
It was not the first time, and it was not the last.	E ne e se lekhetlo la pele, 'me e ne e ke ke ea e-ba ea ho qetela.
We are no longer children.	Ha re sa le bana.
Nobody here.	Haho motho mona.
It is very important.	Ke ea bohlokoa haholo.
You never know when you might need them.	Ha u tsebe hore na u ka li hloka neng.
It was the first time, but we will be back.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele, empa re tla khutla.
We don't have that here.	Ha re na seo mona.
This may be the first time.	E ka 'na eaba ena ke lekhetlo la pele.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
I will go.	Ke tlo tsamaea.
It does almost exclusively.	E etsa hoo e ka bang hantle feela.
To do so, he had to eat.	E le hore a etse joalo, o ne a lokela ho ja.
I mean it was.	Ke bolela hore ho ne ho le jwalo.
The problem is not new.	Bothata ha se litaba tse ncha.
I did not take any clothes.	Ha kea ka ka nka le liaparo.
He could not have thought of that.	A ka be a sa ka a nahana ka seo.
They have too many questions.	Ba na le lipotso tse ngata haholo.
I nodded.	Ke ile ka mo fa hlooho.
We just had our first child.	Re sa tsoa ba le ngoana oa rōna oa pele.
I didn’t ask him to do much, really.	Ha ke a mo kopa ho etsa ntho e ngata, ha e le hantle.
The last time was about a week ago.	Lekhetlo la ho qetela ke hoo e ka bang beke e fetileng.
I have something I want to tell you.	Ke na le seo ke batlang ho o bolella sona.
Her phone started ringing.	Mohala oa hae oa qala ho lla.
I got the idea.	Ke ile ka fumana mohopolo.
They did not comment.	Ha baa ka ba fana ka maikutlo.
You look cute.	O shebahala o le monate.
I will understand that.	Ke tla utloisisa seo.
But he was able to.	Empa o ile a khona.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha a eo.
Here it is again.	Ke ena hape.
In fact, there is nothing in it.	Ka 'nete, ha ho letho ho eona.
Shopping is hard work.	Ho reka ke mosebetsi o boima.
I have nothing to do with it.	Ha ke na letho leo nka le etsang le lona.
A party, like a family, is bigger than anyone else.	Mokete, joalo ka lelapa, o moholo ho feta motho ofe kapa ofe.
But that did not last long.	Empa seo ha sea ka sa nka nako e telele.
Their clothes fit well.	Liaparo tsa bona li ne li lekana hantle.
But this is the first one.	Empa sena ke sa pele.
His name is.	Lebitso la hae ke.
You have to try to understand.	O tlameha ho leka ho utloisisa.
Only I can do this.	Ke 'na feela ea ka etsang sena.
I can stand with everyone.	Nka ema le bohle.
That's the law.	Ke molao.
In fact, it feels better.	Ha e le hantle, e ikutloa e le betere.
Don't say it.	U se ke ua e bolela.
It's just the way, better than anything.	Ke tsela feela, hantle ho feta eng kapa eng.
That was good news, it really was.	Eo e ne e le litaba tse monate, ehlile ho ne ho le joalo.
It is not just about money.	Ha se ka chelete feela.
What you want you will not get.	Seo u se batlang u ke ke ua se fumana.
Before he could arrest her, she was gone.	Pele a ka mo tšoara, o ne a se a le sieo.
Nothing like this had ever happened before.	Ho ne ho se ntho e kang ena e kileng ea etsahala.
It just comes.	E tla feela.
Let me love her.	E re ke mo rate.
You have to do it.	U tlameha ho e etsa.
But get this.	Empa fumana sena.
I wanted to, but I was not sure what that would look like.	Ke ne ke batla, empa ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na seo se tla shebahala joang.
There is no group here.	Haho sehlopha mona.
Then start learning about this.	Ebe u qala ho ithuta ka sena.
I will never return.	Ha ke sa tla khutla.
As friends.	Joaloka metsoalle.
My favorite room is no.	Kamore eo ke e ratang haholo ke che.
When.	E ne e le neng.
I believe he has some nice things to tell me.	Ke lumela hore o na le lintho tse monate tseo a lokelang ho mpolella tsona.
Although the work had nothing to say.	Leha mosebetsi o ne o se na letho leo o ka le buang.
However, they have a lot of money.	Leha ho le joalo, ba na le chelete e ngata.
I could see that happening.	Ke ne ke bona seo se etsahala.
And it will always be that way for some time to come.	'Me e tla lula e le joalo ka nako e itseng e tlang.
Are you okay.	Na u hantle.
There is no other.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe.
I did the same to him.	Ke ile ka etsa se tšoanang ho eena.
He loves your team.	O rata sehlopha sa hau.
One of the best.	E 'ngoe ka ho fetisisa.
Now, it's not just a thought.	Jwale, ha se mohopolo feela.
I.	Ke.
He came to the end.	O ile a fihla qetellong.
These are people who want to live.	Bana ke batho ba batlang ho phela.
And do not forget.	'Me u se ke ua lebala.
I told them that this would not be a problem.	Ke ile ka ba bolella hore sena e ne e ke ke ea e-ba bothata.
We all stayed in the room.	Kaofela re ile ra lula ka phaposing.
It may or may not come.	E ka 'na ea tla kapa ea se ke ea hlola e tla.
Maybe you are.	Mohlomong u joalo.
Going forward the news was not good.	Ho ea pele litaba li ne li se monate.
Have you ever met him?	Na u se u kile ua kopana le eena?
Certainly, I hope so.	Ka sebele, ke tšepa hore ho joalo .
It should not happen here.	Ha ea lokela ho etsahala mona.
He will never believe it!	Ha ho mohla a tla lumela!
She is always very happy.	O dula a thabile haholo.
I felt good about that.	Ke ne ke ikutloa hantle ka seo.
He had a lot of money and there was nothing he could do.	O ne a e-na le chelete e ngata ’me ho se letho leo a ka le etsang.
You can always talk to me.	O ka bua le nna kamehla.
So that’s where you have it.	Kahoo ke moo u nang le eona.
Write down your thoughts.	Ngola maikutlo a hau.
You will have more tomorrow.	U tla ba le tse ling hosane.
But then they were gone.	Empa joale ba ne ba ile.
Maybe they didn't have it.	Mohlomong ba ne ba se na eona.
Then read them again.	Ebe u li bala hape.
It can make us think of it as an individual, a person.	E ka etsa hore re nahane ka eona re le motho ka mong, motho.
They did not want that.	Ba ne ba sa batle seo.
To him it seemed a bit strange.	Ho eena ho ne ho bonahala eka ke taba e makatsang.
He had never been in so much pain.	O ne a e-s’o ka a utloa bohloko hakaalo.
Her whole family feels very close to me.	Lelapa la hae kaofela le ikutloa le le haufi haholo le ’na.
Strange question, but important.	Potso e makatsang, empa e bohlokoa.
It is not easy by any means.	Ha ho bonolo ka mokhoa ofe kapa ofe.
But we need to learn why we think so.	Empa re lokela ho ithuta hore na ke hobane’ng ha re nahana joalo.
We ate a lot of food.	Re ile ra ja lijo tse ngata.
You do not need to know now.	Ha o hloke ho tseba hona joale.
It could be both.	E ka ba bobeli.
However, the fact of the matter is that others are coming.	Leha ho le joalo, 'nete ea taba ke hore ba bang ba tla.
Children do such things all the time.	Bana ba etsa lintho tse joalo ka linako tsohle.
I don't find this method anywhere.	Ha ke fumane mokhoa ona kae kapa kae.
You will come out.	U tla tsoa.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho joalo.
It may seem like you still have to pay.	Ho ka bonahala eka u ntse u tlameha ho lefa.
But he knew it was hard work.	Empa o ne a tseba hore e ne e le mosebetsi o matla.
They took everyone, and started looking.	Ba nka e mong le e mong, ba qala ho sheba.
We will talk more.	Re tla bua ho feta.
You need someone like you.	O hloka motho ea tšoanang le uena.
Nobody told me that.	Haho motho ya ileng a mpolella seo.
So off we go.	Kahoo rea ea.
The car refuses to start.	Koloi e hana ho qala.
It's not too hard.	Ha e thata haholo.
But there is more.	Empa ho na le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
It will not be fun.	E ka se be monate.
It’s not just about you and what you want.	Ha se feela ka uena le seo u se batlang.
For people like her, walking is a daily occurrence.	Ho batho ba kang eena, ho tsamaea ke ntho ea letsatsi le letsatsi.
We don't have much time.	Ha re na nako e ngata.
I mean, a little, well.	Ke bolela, hanyane, hantle.
We can go.	Re ka tsamaea.
But, that doesn't make sense.	Empa, hoo ha ho na kelello.
And the strange thing is, we got nothing.	Mme ntho e makatsang ke hore, ha re a ka ra fumana letho.
Clearly, it was someone else.	Ho hlakile hore e ne e le motho e mong.
We were not alone.	Re ne re se mong.
One can certainly count on that.	Ka sebele motho a ka tšepa joalo.
I understand how you feel.	Kea utloisisa hore na u ikutloa joang.
I mean, it's not just me.	Ke bolela, ha se nna feela.
I thought a lot about that.	Ke ile ka nahana haholo ka seo.
It was an opportunity to do so.	E ne e le monyetla oa ho etsa joalo.
I hope you will be back soon.	Ke tšepa hore u tla khutla haufinyane.
It's not your style at all.	Ha se mokhoa oa hau ho hang.
They need to know this before they try to write.	Ba hloka ho tseba sena pele ba leka ho ngola.
But it did not happen.	Empa ha ho a ka ha etsahala.
Food for thought.	Lijo tsa ho nahana.
She just cries about how difficult life is.	O lla feela ka hore na bophelo bo thata hakae.
But, that is sometimes the case.	Empa, ho joalo ka linako tse ling.
None of these are bad in any way.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsena e mpe ka tsela leha e le efe.
He lived a very happy life.	O ne a phela bophelo bo monate haholo.
I would know it anywhere.	Ke ne ke tla e tseba kae kapa kae.
But he needed to understand.	Empa o ne a hloka ho utloisisa.
You would not understand it.	U ne u ke ke ua e utloisisa.
I have not tried.	Ha kea leka.
Which is a pity.	E leng masoabi.
We're almost done here.	Re se re batla re qetile mona.
My father got a job.	Ntate o ile a fumana mosebetsi.
It would have been very dangerous.	Ho ka be ho bile kotsi haholo.
We know what we can do here.	Re tseba seo re ka se etsang mona.
And the implication of that is that they are useless.	Mme maikutlo a seo ke hore ha ba na thuso.
So, it is very good.	Kahoo, e ntle haholo.
It was nice to be with him right here.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba le eena hona mona.
It was very difficult.	Ho ne ho le boima haholo.
I needed someone.	Ke ne ke hloka motho.
I just didn't hear him enter the room.	Ha kea ka ka utloa feela ha a kena ka kamoreng.
I always loved to swim.	Ke ne ke lula ke rata ho sesa.
This is one of those times.	Ena ke e 'ngoe ea linako tseo.
You can be a boy.	O ka ba moshanyana.
I can't continue to do this.	Ha ke khone ho tsoela pele ho etsa sena.
I consider him to be the only man to me, always.	Ke mo nka e le eena a le mong feela monna ho nna, kamehla.
I'm so glad you're here.	Ke thabile haholo ha o le teng.
When we returned home, the family was waiting for us.	Ha re khutlela hae, lelapa le ne le re emetse.
I mean, enough.	Ke bolela, ho lekana.
However, his new shoes made him very attractive.	Leha ho le joalo, lieta tsa hae tse ncha li ile tsa etsa hore a be motle haholo.
Probably because he doesn't want to be like everyone else.	Mohlomong hobane ha a batle joaloka ba bang kaofela.
It was coming.	E ne e tla.
We don't think about it.	Ha re nahane ka eona.
I found one of them.	Ke fumane e mong oa bona.
She had never thought of him before, let alone her.	O ne a e-s’o ka a nahana ka eena, re se re sa re letho ka eena.
But it was not going to happen here.	Empa e ne e sa tlo etsahala mona.
I should not call him now.	Ha kea lokela ho mo letsetsa hona joale.
This is not the case with my parents.	Hona ha ho joalo ho batsoali ba ka.
I just wanted to make sure nothing was wrong.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho etsa bonnete ba hore ha ho letho le phoso.
I really love you in a different way.	Ke hlile ke u rata ka tsela e 'ngoe.
That’s where you have it.	Ke moo u nang le eona.
He knew something, but he was not sure what it was.	O ne a tseba ho hong, empa o ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke eng.
I will never have an idea.	Ha ke sa tla ba le maikutlo.
We meet again.	Re kopana hape.
Your mother.	Mme wa hao.
I needed his help right now.	Ke ne ke hloka thuso ea hae ka hona joale.
It won't take long now.	E ke ke ea nka nako e telele joale.
They are not good people.	Ha se batho ba molemo.
So much.	Haholo.
It was amazing to work with him.	E bile ntho e makatsang ho sebetsa le eena.
I never left it that way.	Ke ne ke sa e tlohela ka tsela eo.
There is nothing better than to do it.	Ha ho letho le betere ho ka le etsa.
And yours will be.	Le ya hao e tla ba teng.
He spoke to her.	O ile a bua le eena.
Of course, that means making a big party.	Ha e le hantle, seo se bolela ho etsa mokete o moholo.
Not good.	Ha e ntle.
Their ideas are useless.	Maikutlo a bona ha a na thuso.
Life is Beautiful.	Bophelo bo monate.
But now he had something to do.	Empa joale o ne a e-na le seo a ka se etsang.
No, that is not enough for me.	Che, hoo ha hoa lekana ho 'na.
Say something important.	Bua ntho ea bohlokoa.
We have to go there.	Re tlameha ho ea moo.
And they did so.	Mme ba etsa jwalo.
The way to trust and betray.	Tsela ea ho tšepa le ho eka.
We wondered who it was after that, and why.	Re ile ra ipotsa hore na e ne e le mang ka mor’a eona, hona hobane’ng.
They stayed that way for a long time.	Ba ile ba lula joalo ka nako e telele.
Better than that.	Ho molemo ho feta ho eona.
I don't know what to do.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o tla etsang.
This can happen emotionally.	Sena se ka etsahala ka maikutlo.
Therefore, their work is important.	Ka hona, mosebetsi oa bona ke oa bohlokoa.
I still love you.	Ke ntse ke u rata.
He means to write.	O bolela ho ngola.
It was a difficult decision.	E ne e le qeto e boima.
You can tell them here or not.	U ka ba bolella mona kapa che.
And now, here we are.	Mme jwale, ke rona bana.
I wish you would take my baby with me.	Ke lakatsa hore u nke ngoana oa ka le 'na.
He thought he was great at his job, good at working.	O ne a nahana hore o moholo mosebetsing oa hae, o motle ho sebetsa.
Like a thought, but of something that has never happened.	Joalo ka mohopolo, empa oa ntho e so kang e etsahala.
Some people do not get it.	Batho ba bang ha ba e fumane.
They actually look scared of him.	Ha e le hantle ba shebahala ba mo tšaba.
Make sure you use only what you need.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u sebelisa feela seo u se hlokang.
But often they have nothing to say.	Empa hangata ha ba na seo ba ka se buang.
Perhaps they should consider doing so more often.	Mohlomong ba lokela ho nahana ho etsa joalo hangata.
This is no longer the case.	Sena ha se sa le joalo.
I do not know how to love a man.	Ha ke tsebe ho rata monna.
Food is available.	Lijo li teng.
We finally got there and played.	Qetellong re fihla moo 'me ra bapala.
That is a normal part of every group of people.	Eo ke ntho ea kamehla ea sehlopha se seng le se seng sa batho.
He also sleeps.	Le eena o robala.
I do not understand why it will not work.	Ha ke utloisise hore na hobaneng e ke ke ea sebetsa.
When you hear it there is nothing there.	Ha u e utloa ha ho letho moo.
I hope you do too.	Ke tšepa hore le uena u etsa joalo.
It does not matter.	Ha e bohlokoa.
Never.	Le ka mohla.
No one will ever see them.	Ha ho motho ea tla ke a li bone.
I don't know what's going on.	Ha ke tsebe se etsahalang.
We look strong.	Re shebahala re le matla.
She had no children.	O ne a se na bana.
He slammed the door.	A bula lemati ka matla.
Besides, it means more than anything for your family.	Ntle ho moo, ho bolela ho feta ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe bakeng sa lelapa la hau.
They start eating well.	Ba qala ho ja hantle.
I'll talk to you about it.	Ke tla bua le uena ka eona.
It wasn't just talking.	E ne e sa bue feela.
Last family meal.	Lijo tsa ho qetela tsa lelapa.
You have to talk to him.	U tlameha ho bua le eena.
She cried.	A lla.
I think we had a chance to win this year.	Ke nahana hore re bile le monyetla oa ho hlola selemong sena.
I love your hands.	Ke rata matsoho a hao.
This really works now.	Sena se hlile se sebetsa hona joale.
That's when he left her.	Ke ka mor’a moo a ileng a mo tlohela.
You have to suffer.	U tlameha ho utloa bohloko.
There have been a lot of things coming and going since you left.	Ho bile le lintho tse ngata tse tlang le ho tsamaea haesale u tsoa.
Even more dangerous.	Le ho feta kotsi.
Tell them they don't have time to talk about it.	Ba bolelle hore ha ba na nako ea ho bua ka eona.
Some days are worse than others.	Ka matsatsi a mang e mpe ho feta a mang.
I want to help you.	Ke batla ho o thusa.
But none of them are around.	Empa ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea haufi.
And on time.	Le ka nako.
I also sat down.	Le ’na ka lula fatše.
None of us said anything.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea ileng a bua letho.
The police arrested them.	Mapolesa a ba tšoara.
I hope it helps.	Ke tšepa hore e ea thusa.
I mean, he just looks good.	Ke bolela, o shebahala hantle feela.
We continued to play.	Re ile ra tsoela pele ho bapala.
I've seen you work.	Ke o bone o sebetsa.
But it is.	Empa ho jwalo.
They will help us.	Ba tla re thusa.
He has done this now.	Sena o se entse hona joale.
It was just fun.	E ne e le monate feela.
I want to buy a house.	Ke batla ho reka ntlo.
He plays a lot.	O bapala haholo.
Very good news.	Litaba tse monate haholo.
We drank heavily.	Re ne re noa haholo.
But you still need to get some sleep.	Empa u ntse u lokela ho robala ka linako tse ling.
Everyone to his own.	E mong le e mong ho ea hae.
He knew it knew him.	O ne a tseba hore e mo tseba.
But there will be things to come.	Empa ho tla ba le lintho tse tlang.
He often did not want to play.	Hangata o ne a sa batle ho bapala.
Thank you so much for dinner.	Ke leboha haholo ka lijo tsa mantsiboea.
But he could hear what was happening.	Empa o ne a utloa se etsahalang.
We are strong.	Re matla.
The situation did not matter to me.	Boemo e ne e se taba ho 'na.
He told you about me.	O le boleletse ka nna.
Also, you know.	Hape, ua tseba.
He was still dressed.	O ne a ntse a apere.
All we needed.	Tsohle tseo re neng re li hloka.
It's not fun when that happens at work.	Ha ho monate ha seo se etsahala mosebetsing.
He can't tell anyone.	A ke ke a bolella motho.
If only you had a lot of money.	Haeba feela u ne u e-na le chelete e ngata.
I could not let go of it.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho e tlohela.
We are not that kind of place.	Ha re sebaka sa mofuta oo.
I don't know about you, boy.	Ha ke tsebe ka wena, moshanyana.
They were tired.	Ba ne ba khathetse.
We can do better.	Re khona ho betere.
It is easier said than done.	Ho bonolo ho bua ho feta ho etsa.
Sometimes it was very nice.	Ka linako tse ling e bile ntle haholo.
It's not right.	Ha se hantle.
I had to go out and meet them.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tsoa ho ea kopana le bona.
And you can see through him.	'Me u ka bona ka eena.
Try to write as you speak.	Leka ho ngola ha o ntse o bua.
This also did not work.	Sena le sona ha sea ka sa sebetsa.
Back to back.	Morao morao.
And we did that.	Mme re ile ra etsa seo.
Easy is better.	Ho bonolo ho molemo.
The mood stopped.	Maikutlo a ema.
They could have done what they wanted.	Ba ka be ba entse seo ba se batlang.
That is not what this is.	Ha se seo sena se leng sona.
It was no better.	E ne e se ntle le ho feta.
They were playing and playing.	Ba ne ba bapala le ho bapala.
That is the way of his people.	Ke tsela ea batho ba hae.
I hope you get a job soon.	Ke tšepa hore o tla fumana mosebetsi haufinyane.
I have to go back, he thought.	Ke tlameha ho khutlela morao, o ile a nahana.
It is much better to read a book.	Ho molemo haholo ho bala buka.
Here he is, and he is.	Ke mona mme o teng.
But it was a week before that.	Empa e ne e le beke pele ho moo.
I found that.	Ke fumane seo.
He was a man.	E ne e le motho.
I use it because it works well.	Ke e sebelisa hobane e sebetsa hantle.
He has never been an adult.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba motho e moholo.
I heard him.	Ke ile ka mo utloa.
We kept talking.	Re ile ra tsoela pele ho bua.
Certainly not me.	Ka sebele ha se ’na.
I really think this works.	Ke hlile ke nahana hore sena sea sebetsa.
When you look at it, it makes sense.	Ha u e sheba, ke lebaka le hlokang kelello.
It seems innocent enough.	Ho bonahala ho se na molato ho lekana.
He had to do this quickly.	O ne a lokela ho etsa sena kapele.
They were suggesting their new clothes.	Ba ne ba fana ka maikutlo ka liaparo tsa bona tse ncha.
However, this was no better.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se ne se se betere.
Another head area.	Sebaka se seng sa hlooho.
You know how dangerous it is.	Ua tseba hore na o kotsi hakae.
They have an issue that will look after them.	Ba na le taba e tla ba sheba.
I don't think we will need their help.	Ha ke nahane hore re tla hloka thuso ea bona.
I enjoy it too.	Ke e thabela le.
He goes back.	O khutlela morao.
You can leave here tomorrow.	U ka tloha mona hosane.
They are waiting for him.	Ba mo emetse.
You can't sleep on this.	Ha u khone ho robala ho sena.
His mother did.	Mme wa hae o ile a etsa jwalo.
He certainly was.	Ka sebele o ne a le joalo.
The problem is his job.	Bothata ke mosebetsi oa hae.
Some people may like it, others may not.	Batho ba bang ba ka ’na ba e rata, ba bang ba ka ’na ba se e rate.
That's the way it is now.	Ke tsela eo ho leng ka eona ha joale.
What they do is even more fun.	Seo ba se etsang se monate le ho feta.
The fact that he is not there is news to me.	Taba ea hore ha a eo ke litaba ho 'na.
Here you go.	Ke tsena.
We'll just stop and see.	Re tla ema feela re bone.
It is up to us to find them.	Ho ho rona ho li fumana.
But the sun will help.	Empa letsatsi le tla thusa.
And no one ever expected it to be human.	Mme ho ne ho se motho ya kileng a lebella hore e ka ba motho.
That's very true.	Ho joalo haholo.
They just read aloud.	Ba mpa ba bala ka matla.
He tells you how to get or do these things.	O u bolella mokhoa oa ho fumana kapa ho etsa lintho tsena.
No, it was not.	Che, ho ne ho le joalo.
It doesn't have to be you or me anymore.	Ha e sa tlameha ho ba uena kapa nna.
In fact, it may be the only one.	Ha e le hantle, e ka 'na ea e-ba eona feela.
I could not drink it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e noa.
Check out this place tomorrow.	Sheba sebaka sena hosane.
He enjoyed living there.	O ne a thabela ho dula moo.
Let there be strength as well as simplicity.	A ho be le matla hammoho le bonolo.
As with the news.	Joalo ka litaba.
Of course he was done.	Ehlile o ne a qetile.
This work is the most important in the work.	Mosebetsi ona ke oa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa mosebetsing.
I tell you it was a job.	Kea u bolella hore e ne e le mosebetsi o itseng.
But there are good things you can do.	Empa ho na le lintho tse molemo tseo u ka li etsang.
We have no problem deciding that it can.	Ha re na bothata ba ho etsa qeto ea hore e ka khona.
Probably no one knew.	Mohlomong ha ho motho ea neng a tseba.
He will usually give you a chance to talk to him.	Hangata o tla u fa monyetla oa ho bua le eena.
I make him say it often.	Ke etsa hore a e bue hangata.
Soon, they would get there.	Ho e-s'o ee kae, ba ne ba tla fihla moo.
It was the only question he forgot to ask.	E ne e le eona feela potso eo a ileng a lebala ho e botsa.
I'm just playing with you.	Ke ntse ke bapala le uena feela.
So we decided to make a new application.	Kahoo re ile ra etsa qeto ea ho etsa kopo e ncha.
But now he is about to start.	Empa joale o se a tla qala.
He sat down and looked.	A dula mme a sheba.
You look harmless.	U shebahala u se na kotsi.
It was what everyone thought.	E ne e le seo bohle ba neng ba se nahana.
The more you do this, the stronger you will become.	Ha u ntse u etsa sena, u tla ba le matla le ho feta.
Pay with money.	Lefa ka chelete.
I feel so important right now.	Ke utloa eka e bohlokoa joalo hona joale.
To be honest, just like anyone else.	Ho bua 'nete, joalo ka motho e mong.
In each case, they have seized it, despite obstacles we can scarcely imagine. "	Taba e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe, e mong le e mong o fana ka maikutlo a hae.
They just don't like it.	Ba mpa ba sa e rate.
I heard it before.	Ke ile ka e utloa pele.
It made him need more help.	E ile ea etsa hore a hloke ho mo thusa ka ho fetisisa.
He would have to make his decision.	O ne a tla lokela ho etsa qeto ya hae.
I can't reach it.	Ha ke khone ho o fihlela.
First with me.	Pele le nna.
Or it comes from him.	Kapa o tsoa ho eena.
It obviously did.	Ho hlakile hore e entse joalo.
But that is a matter for another time.	Empa taba eo ke ea nako e 'ngoe.
I was, and I was strong.	Ke ne ke le nna, mme ke le matla.
I can't thank you for this idea.	Ha ke khone ho leboha mohopolo ona.
That will work for you.	Seo se tla sebetsa ho uena.
He has been alone for a very long time.	Esale a le mong ka nako e telele haholo.
They would be at home.	Ba ne ba tla be ba le hae.
It was a very good thing, and everyone was happy.	E ne e le taba e ntle haholo, mme bohle ba ne ba thabile.
Will they be good?	Na ba tla ba molemo?
And it is not.	'Me ha ho joalo.
Finally, something good is happening!	Qetellong, ho na le ntho e ntle e etsahalang!
I don't think anyone did that.	Ha ke nahane hore ha ho motho ea ileng a etsa joalo.
He, who did not know the danger, said nothing.	Eena, ea neng a sa tsebe kotsi, ha aa ka a bua letho.
We mean it.	Re bolela eona.
The children were so happy that they did not cry.	Bana ba ne ba thabile hoo ba sa kang ba lla.
Many more, he does not see.	Tse ling tse ngata, ha a li bone.
That is, if you want to take it.	Ke hore, haeba u batla ho e nka.
It takes a person.	Ho nka motho.
I doubt he was one of us, though.	Ke belaela hore e ne e le e mong wa rona, leha ho le jwalo.
Please just do it.	Ke kopa o mpe o e etse.
So he needs to understand what this law is.	Ka hona ho hlokahala hore a utloisise hore na molao ona ke ofe.
He does not do any of those things.	Ha A etse letho la tseo.
You did not belong to me.	Ha u oa ka.
But we provided an opportunity.	Empa re ile ra fana monyetla.
No thanks!	Che, kea leboha!
You have an opinion.	U na le maikutlo.
Nothing was visible.	Ha ho letho le neng le bonahala.
I’m not sure why you don’t see that.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng ha u sa bone seo.
He hoped he was.	O ne a tšepa hore o ne a le joalo.
I start to think the way they think.	Ke qala ho nahana ka tsela eo ba nahanang ka eona.
We have never been here before.	Ha re e-s'o be mona pele.
So it was hard.	Kahoo ho ne ho le thata.
It does not need to.	Ha e hloke.
All issues are there.	Litaba tsohle li teng.
But he did not listen to her.	Empa ha aa ka a mo utloa.
And this really means something.	'Me sena se hlile se bua ho hong.
Not too hard but not too easy.	Ha ho thata haholo empa ha ho bonolo haholo.
It would definitely make my day.	Ka sebele e ne e tla etsa letsatsi la ka.
They will give you whatever you want.	Ba tla o fa eng kapa eng eo o e batlang.
It decided that they did not.	E ile ea etsa qeto ea hore ha baa e etsa.
I did not hear anything he said.	Ha kea ka ka utloa letho leo a le buang.
There is no question about it.	Ha ho potso ka eona.
I would love to have it.	Nka thabela ho ba le eona.
He had never spent a night with anyone.	Ho ne ho se mohla a kileng a hlola bosiu le motho.
The day was the day before he died.	Letsatsi e ne e le letsatsi pele a hlokahala.
But life is not like that.	Empa bophelo ha bo joalo.
We believe that is not the case.	Re lumela hore ha ho joalo.
I hear your thoughts.	Ke utloa maikutlo a hau.
He clasped his hands tightly.	A kopa matsoho a hae ka thata.
Each time she saw him, she began to say bad things about him.	Nako le nako ha a mo bona, o ne a bua lintho tse mpe ka eena.
Most people would have to buy a car.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba tla tlameha ho reka koloi.
However, I see that.	Leha ho le joalo, kea bona hore .
We have just arrived.	Re sa tsoa fihla.
It begins to ask its own questions.	E qala ho ipotsa lipotso tsa eona.
Except that is not the case.	Ntle le hore ha ho joalo.
That eventually led to my meeting with them.	Qetellong seo se ile sa etsa hore ke kopane le bona.
I need that.	Ke hloka seo.
That year.	Selemong seo.
We will not have to do that.	Ha re na ho tlameha ho etsa joalo.
We just talked on the phone, we did.	Re sa tsoa bua ka mohala, re entse joalo.
It can't happen.	E ke ke ea etsahala.
Or he said.	Kapa o ile a bolela.
He refuses to do anything.	O hana ho etsa letho.
I'm waiting to read that book.	Ke emetse ho bala buka eo.
He watched it, happy.	A e shebella, a thabile.
Sometimes he referred to her husband.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a bua ka monna oa hae.
One thing he can do with it.	Ntho e le 'ngoe eo a ka e etsang ka eona.
He wanted something else, he wanted something else.	O ne a batla ntho e 'ngoe hape, a batla ntho e' ngoe hape.
He was happy too.	Le eena o ne a thabile.
Get what you have from him.	Fumana seo u nang le sona ho eena.
I think he did not know what to do.	Ke nahana hore o ne a sa tsebe seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.	E ne e se mpe, empa le eona e ne e se ntle.
Or is that what he always thought.	Kapa ke seo a neng a lula a se nahana.
Yes, a long time ago.	E, nako e telele.
Thank you mom.	Kea leboha mme.
Why the picture went on, he knew nothing.	Ke hobane'ng ha setšoantšo se ile sa tsoela pele, o ne a sa tsebe letho.
I would look forward to hearing from you.	Ke tla lebella ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
She seems to be reading my comments.	O bonahala a bala maikutlo a ka.
He is a team player.	Ke sebapali sa sehlopha.
We were both there.	Ka bobeli re ne re le teng.
Maybe there are good things out there.	Mohlomong ho na le lintho tse ntle moo.
But we still do not know why or what happened.	Empa ha re e-so tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng kapa se etsahetseng.
We really enjoyed that.	Re ile ra thabela seo haholo.
My wife and children are so sweet.	Mosali oa ka le bana ba monate haholo.
And we still have your wonderful story.	Mme le rona re ntse re na le taba e makatsang ya hao.
He said nothing.	Ha a ka a bua letho.
I knew my stuff.	Ke ne ke tseba litaba tsa ka.
Now we come.	Joale re tla.
It will make news.	E tla etsa litaba.
He loved his job.	O ne a rata mosebetsi oa hae.
Thanks so much again.	Ke leboha haholo hape.
We say, look at what happened.	Re re, sheba se etsahetseng.
They never talked together again.	Ha baa ka ba hlola ba bua hammoho.
That's his name.	Ke lebitso la hae.
That took hours and hours.	Seo se ile sa nka lihora le lihora.
This alone.	Sena feela.
We just need to go beyond ourselves.	Re mpa re hloka ho feta ho rona.
he asked.	a botsa.
Of course, make no one.	Ha e le hantle, etsa hore ho se be motho.
This amount will suffice.	Chelete ena e tla lekana.
This is a house that exists today.	Ena ke ntlo e teng kajeno.
People were not his thing.	Batho e ne e se ntho ea hae.
Everyone is in danger.	E mong le e mong o kotsing.
It is alive.	E a phela.
I have never encountered such a problem.	Ha ke e-s'o ka ke kopana le bothata bo tšoanang le boo.
But he works hard.	Empa o sebetsa ka thata.
He knew it, though he did not know it.	O ne a e tseba, le hoja a ne a sa e tsebe.
That is why he does it.	Ke ka hona o e etsang.
You will.	U tla etsa joalo.
But here's the problem.	Empa bothata ke bona.
It's not just about fun times.	Ha se feela ka linako tse monate.
And no money, that way.	'Me ha ho na chelete, ka tsela eo.
We would not have done it.	Re ka be re sa e etsa.
He became a father.	O ile a ba ntate.
He refuses to do so.	O hana ho etsa joalo.
Saving others can be a challenge.	Ho boloka ba bang e ka ba bothata.
That's him.	Ke eena.
It was an old car.	E ne e le koloi ea khale.
They drank a lot of coffee.	Ba ile ba noa kofi e ngata.
I try very hard.	Ke leka ka matla.
Use your strength.	Sebelisa matla a hau.
But there was none.	Empa ho ne ho se na.
He works emotionally.	O sebetsa ka maikutlo.
He came when he felt that way.	O ile a tla ha a ikutloa joalo.
He refused to work with us as a group.	O ile a hana ho sebetsa le rōna re le sehlopha.
He is here with us in this room.	O teng mona le rona ka phaposing ena.
There was nothing he could do.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang.
There are no such problems.	Ha ho mathata a joalo.
It came from him.	A tsoa ho eena.
In the second week.	Bekeng ea bobeli.
Now it is old.	Hona joale ke khale.
Let this happen.	Lumella sena ho etsahala.
After that it was easy.	Ka mor'a moo ho ne ho le bonolo.
If you want to go, get out now.	Haeba u batla ho tsamaea, tsoa hona joale.
They are no longer here.	Ha ba sa le mona.
It was a very difficult thing to do.	E ne e le ntho e thata haholo ho e etsa.
Lots of things like that.	Lintho tse ngata tse joalo.
You certainly know them.	Ka sebele u ba tseba.
We know how it is.	Rea tseba hore na ho joang.
I returned to talk to him about it.	Ke ile ka khutla ho tla bua le eena ka taba eo.
Her father, so long ago.	Ntate oa hae, khale hakana.
I wanted to do better.	Ke ne ke batla ho etsa betere.
I can't say why.	Ha ke khone ho bolela lebaka.
We are moving fast.	Re tsamaea kapele.
I will write what you need.	Ke tla ngola seo o se hlokang.
That's where it's at.	Ke hona moo e leng teng.
If for some reason everything goes well, go ahead.	Haeba ka lebaka le itseng ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e le hantle ho tsoela pele, tsoela pele.
The same is true for everyone.	Ho joalo le ka bohle.
I wanted to read about the place.	Ke ne ke batla ho bala ka sebaka.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
She loves school.	O rata sekolo.
The water was delicious.	Metsi a ne a le monate.
Obviously he would not have cared.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a ka se tsotelle.
He wished it could be so.	O ne a lakatsa eka ho ka ba jwalo.
He lived there for some years.	O ile a lula moo ka lilemo tse itseng.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
You should do that if you can.	U lokela ho etsa joalo ha u khona.
Maybe he really didn't want to know.	Mohlomong o ne a hlile a sa batle ho tseba.
But a good idea.	Empa mohopolo o motle.
It will take a long time.	Ho tla nka nako e telele.
If true, proceed.	Haeba bonnete, tsoela pele.
We had not seen each other for a few years.	E ne e se e le lilemo tse seng kae re sa kopane.
Try to use your hands as little as you can.	Leka ho sebelisa matsoho a hau hanyane kamoo u ka khonang.
Some people find it difficult.	Batho ba bang ba fumana ka tsela e thata.
The two of us would walk together happily.	Bobeli ba rōna re ne re tla tsamaea hammoho re thabile.
This is a situation that is very difficult to reach.	Bona ke boemo boo ho leng thata ho bo fihlela.
It is now a wet spot.	Hona joale ke sebaka se metsi.
Of course it is important to know.	Ehlile ke litaba tse bohlokoa ho tseba.
I just got in.	Ke qeta ho kena.
I think you will love it there.	Ke nahana hore u tla e rata moo.
We could have done better.	Re ka be re entse betere.
He could no longer comprehend what had just happened.	O ne a se a sa khone ho utloisisa se sa tsoa etsahala.
This is not the place to do it.	Sena ha se sebaka sa ho etsa joalo.
When we can, we will get out of here.	Ha re se re khona, re tla tsoa mona.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Empa ho bonahala ho se joalo.
The boy told his mother about his day.	Moshanyana o ile a bolella 'mè oa hae ka letsatsi la hae.
I could not work.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho sebetsa.
The baby began to cry loudly.	Ngoana a qala ho lla haholo.
It should not be so.	Ha ea lokela ho ba joalo.
I never thought of it that way before.	Ke ne ke e-s’o ka ke e nahana ka tsela eo.
She was really looking forward to the man.	O ne a hlile a lebeletse monna.
The girl is very beautiful.	Ngoanana o motle haholo.
This is not the case.	Sena ha se joalo.
We'll look into it.	Re tla e sheba.
But notice how this happens.	Empa hlokomela hore na sena se etsahala joang.
It was up to me.	E ne e le ho nna.
You only get one chance.	O fumana monyetla o le mong feela.
They asked him carefully.	Ba ile ba mo botsa ka hloko.
I like reading.	Ke rata ho bala.
We could never do this again.	Re ne re ke ke ra hlola re etsa sena.
It was a party or something.	E ne e le mokete o itseng kapa ho hong.
Thank you.	Rea leboha.
That's how money worked.	Ke kamoo chelete e neng e sebetsa kateng.
He’s back and he’s still playing a little bit.	O morao mme o ntse a tsoela pele ho bapala hanyane.
But that was not true.	Empa hoo e ne e se ’nete.
You are my dog.	U ntja ea ka.
Just like anything you want.	Joalo ka eng kapa eng eo u e batlang.
But often they just sat and slept.	Empa hangata ba ne ba lula feela 'me ba robala.
Either way.	Mokhoa o mong kapa o mong.
You know how these things work.	Ua tseba hore na lintho tsena li sebetsa joang.
And they knew him.	Mme ba ne ba mo tseba.
Here is an old picture of that.	Mona ke setšoantšo sa khale sa seo.
We just need to connect more than we are now.	Re hloka feela ho kopana ho feta kamoo re leng ka teng hona joale.
He did not know the truth of that.	O ne a sa tsebe bonnete ba taba eo.
The truth is not always so simple.	Ha se hangata 'nete e leng bonolo hakana.
I couldn't even think straight.	Ke ne ke sa khone le ho nahana hantle.
If he can't find you here, he'll find you there.	Ha a ka o fumana mona, o tla o fumana teng.
I have no idea what is going on here.	Ho hang ha ke utloisise se etsahalang mona.
Go to work.	Tsamaea ho ea mosebetsing.
There was no space.	Ho ne ho se sebaka.
Finally they all wept.	Qetellong ba ile ba lla kaofela.
If you are buying now.	Haeba u reka hona joale.
He does it behind your back.	O e etsa ka mora hao.
And the only reason is that it is.	'Me lebaka feela ke hore ho joalo.
Sometimes do whatever you like.	Ka nako e 'ngoe etsa sohle seo u se ratang.
We do not have what others want but we do not have it.	Ha re na seo ba bang ba se batlang empa ha re na sona.
If only money you need.	Haeba e le chelete feela eo u e hlokang.
They really want to win.	Ehlile ba batla ho hlola.
It was just kind of kind.	E ne e le mofuta o itseng feela.
I do not know where we are.	Ha ke tsebe moo re leng teng.
The children looked happy.	Bana ba ne ba shebahala ba thabile.
That's a good idea.	Ke mohopolo o motle.
But we are not enough.	Empa ha re a lekana.
I did not want any dogs, they came to me.	Ha kea ka ka batla ntja leha e le efe, ba ile ba tla ho 'na.
I have to go fast.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea kapele.
He betrayed her.	O ile a mo eka.
They did not give anything.	Ha baa ka ba fana ka letho.
It's weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang.
Very pretty girl.	Ngoanana ea motle haholo.
And his old room.	Le kamore ea hae ea khale.
That is not good for anyone.	Seo ha se setle ho mang kapa mang.
We will have another child.	Re tla ba le ngoana e mong.
It seemed real.	E ne e bonahala e le ea sebele.
It didn't seem to matter.	E ne e bonahala e se ea bohlokoa.
He is just.	O feela.
Be more than him.	Eba le ho feta ho eena.
However, we now believe that that is a mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, hona joale re lumela hore hoo ke phoso.
And there you are.	Mme ebe ke wena eo.
No one else could have known.	Ha ho motho e mong ea neng a ka tseba.
They, too, would not have to be tall.	Le bona ho ne ho ke ke ha hlokahala hore ba be telele.
Mary since then.	Maria ho tloha ka nako eo.
That is what we should expect.	Ke seo re neng re lokela ho se lebella.
They have been working on this problem for years.	E se e le lilemo ba sebetsa bothata bona.
When the people left here, they went well.	Ha batho ba tloha mona, ba ile ba tsamaea hantle.
I needed a little time to go.	Ke ne ke hloka nako e seng kae hore ke tsamaee.
But he had to know in one way or another.	Empa o ne a lokela ho tseba ka tsela e ’ngoe kapa e ’ngoe.
That should definitely help.	Ka sebele seo se lokela ho thusa.
I just didn’t like it.	Ke ne ke sa e rate feela.
At night, as if it were dangerous.	Bosiu, joalo ka ha ho ne ho le kotsi.
They used to be here and they loved it.	Ba kile ba ba mona mme ba e rata.
But maybe that was better.	Empa mohlomong hoo ho ne ho le molemo.
He seemed to have no problem moving on now.	O ne a bonahala a se na bothata ba ho tsoela pele joale.
It was no longer me.	Ho ne ho se ho se na 'na.
Ja.	Ja.
They would not keep him if he did not want to stay.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba mo boloka haeba a sa batle ho lula.
No, he was very happy.	Che, o ne a thabile haholo.
We see this as a matter of fact.	Re bona taba ena e le taba ea 'nete.
They are afraid of the police.	Ba tšaba mapolesa.
He could stand.	O ne a ka ema.
You took the opportunity.	U nkile monyetla.
It's too close.	E haufi haholo.
You are wrong.	O na le phoso.
It was a place he could not reach.	E ne e le sebakeng seo a neng a ke ke a fihla ho sona.
There is nothing fun about it.	Ha ho letho le monate ka eona.
They really were.	Ruri ba ne ba le jwalo.
He finished everything.	O qetile tsohle.
Any questions?	Ho na le lipotso?
He didn't come out very much.	Ha aa ka a tsoa haholo.
However, it was difficult to walk.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le thata ho tsamaea.
I know things.	Ke tseba lintho.
It was not what he expected to hear.	E ne e se seo a neng a lebeletse ho se utloa.
They think that it never happened.	Ba nahana hore ke mohla e etsahetseng.
You read a lot of children's books.	U bala libuka tsa bana tse ngata haholo.
Very good indeed.	E ntle haholo ruri.
It's been in this place for a long time.	E bile sebakeng sena ka nako e telele.
He has a wonderful wife and several children as well.	O na le mosali ea makatsang le bana ba 'maloa hape.
Some days, nothing good.	Ka matsatsi a mang, ha ho letho le molemo.
You really like this and want more.	U hlile u rata sena 'me u batla ho feta.
Of course you can go and come anytime.	Ha e le hantle u ka ea 'me ua tla neng kapa neng.
I'm happy to have you both.	Ke thabela ho ba le lona ka bobeli.
I will give you anything.	Ke tla u fa eng kapa eng.
Let's say they don't take us.	A re re ha ba re nke.
And he wants what he wants.	Mme o batla seo a se batlang.
I had food.	Ke ne ke na le lijo.
He knows it.	O a e tseba.
The specialist lived nearby.	Setsebi se ne se lula haufi le moo.
Not even a slight glance.	Leha e le ho sheba hanyane.
None of us have ever seen such a thing happen.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea kileng a bona ntho e joalo.
I'm starting to notice things.	Ke qala ho hlokomela lintho.
You are not a doctor.	Ha o ngaka.
These are really important.	Tsena li hlile li bohlokoa.
You get this right, you win.	O fumana sena hantle, o a hlola.
No one was there then.	Ha ho le ea mong ea neng a se a le teng ka nako eo.
I felt so good to be able to talk to someone.	Ke ne ke utloa ho le monate ho khona ho bua le motho e mong.
You just heard.	U utloile feela.
Some believe that he is alive.	Ba bang ba lumela hore o ntse a phela.
We must.	Re tlameha.
You sit down and enjoy your ride.	U lula fatše 'me u thabela ho palama ha hao.
He told me no.	O ile a mpolella che.
I'm going to get some money.	Ke il'o fumana chelete.
I do not know him.	Ha ke mo tsebe.
I have to tell you, they are not very good.	Ke tlameha ho u bolella, ha li ntle haholo.
And she starts to cry.	Mme o qala ho lla.
But that was the easiest situation.	Empa boo e ne e le boemo bo bonolo ka ho fetisisa.
Here, every child needs an individual approach.	Mona, ngoana e mong le e mong o hloka mokhoa oa motho ka mong.
Of course, that was not true.	Ha e le hantle, hoo e ne e se 'nete.
I understand now.	Kea utloisisa joale.
We are equal to it.	Re e lekana.
How did he get the job?	O ile a fumana mosebetsi oo joang?
The police are here.	Mapolesa a teng mona.
I loved to cry.	Ke ne ke rata ho lla.
You do not find anything like it.	Ha o fumane letho le joalo.
They would have to be.	Ba ne ba tla lokela ho ba jwalo.
To make sure he heard and understood what he was saying.	Ho etsa bonnete ba hore o utloile le ho utloisisa seo a se buang.
No one is better off getting it from me.	Ha ho motho ea molemo ho e fumana ho 'na.
I am human.	Ke motho.
Why he took it, he didn't know.	Hobaneng a e nkile, o ne a sa tsebe.
You are important.	U bohlokoa.
Everyone knows him there.	E mong le e mong oa mo tseba moo.
Children do this often.	Bana ba etsa joalo hangata.
Maybe it was hard for everyone.	Mohlomong ho ne ho le thata ho bohle.
These are wonderful times.	Ke linako tse monate hakana.
And we have our son.	Mme re na le mora wa rona.
Caring for a dog was relatively easy.	Ho hlokomela ntja ho ne ho batla ho le bonolo.
Then everyone went his own way.	Eaba e mong le e mong oa tsamaea ka tsela ea hae.
His work seemed inadequate.	Mosebetsi oa hae o ne o bonahala o sa lekana.
He had it when he was a child.	O kile a ba le eona ha e sa le ngoana.
But that doesn't matter.	Empa hoo ha ho na taba.
I just can't go back to that place.	Ha ke khone ho khutlela sebakeng seo feela.
But sometimes things happened.	Empa ka linako tse ling lintho li ne li etsahala.
Everything was in danger.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e le kotsing.
I thought so, too.	Ke ile ka nahana jwalo, le nna.
You do not need this.	Ha o hloke sena.
I went to look at it.	Ke ile ka ea e sheba.
Make a careful decision.	Etsa qeto ka hloko.
Thanks again for the good work.	Ke leboha hape ka mosebetsi o motle.
What, if anything, is wrong?	Ke eng, haeba ho na le phoso?
He did not seem to know what was wrong with him.	Ho ne ho bonahala a sa tsebe hore na o ne a tšoeroe ke eng.
I didn't need it.	Ke ne ke sa e hloke.
More so with their parents.	Ho feta joalo ka batsoali ba bona.
It is a very difficult time.	Ke nako e thata haholo.
Finally, he leaves.	Qetellong, oa tsamaea.
He thought he had been there a long time.	O ne a nahana hore ke khale a le moo.
For that, it is a question.	Bakeng sa seo, ke potso.
It’s not that hard that way.	Ha ho thata hakaalo ka tsela eo.
You just want to work.	O batla ho sebetsa feela.
It seemed so easy.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le bonolo haholo.
So there are a lot of things.	Kahoo ho na le lintho tse ngata.
So you don’t have to think about it.	E le hore u se ke ua nahana ka eona.
Without water, there is no life.	Ntle le metsi, ha ho bophelo.
The worst it can do.	E mpe ka ho fetisisa eo e ka e etsang.
He was not just talking.	O ne a sa bue feela.
I never seen one, you know.	Ha ke eso bone le le leng, le a tseba.
We think we do.	Re nahana hore re etsa joalo.
You can always get three.	U ka fumana tse tharo kamehla.
But then again, that’s what we really liked, in a way.	Empa hape, ke seo re neng re se rata haholo, ka tsela e itseng.
That's where he is.	Ke eo moo a leng teng.
What would their lives be like without me.	Bophelo ba bona bo ne bo tla ba joang ha ke le sieo.
Of course, there is work, too.	Ehlile, ho na le mosebetsi, hape.
Comment.	Fana ka maikutlo.
He lives with his father.	O lula le ntate oa hae.
That is the question.	Eo ke potso.
Yes, he would save her.	E, o ne a tla mo boloka.
Talk about good life.	Bua ka bophelo bo monate.
Of course this was his story.	Ehlile ena e ne e le taba ea hae.
But each genre has some strange features.	Empa mofuta o mong le o mong o na le lintho tse makatsang.
That was my life.	E ne e le bophelo ba ka boo.
How long can you live without water?	U ka phela nako e kae u se na metsi?
From there it has been before.	Ho tloha moo ho bile teng pele.
But it can be easier said than done.	Empa ho ka ba bonolo ho bua ho feta ho etsa.
Well, some of them.	Hantle, ba bang ba bona.
We can never know too much of it.	Re ke ke ra tseba hore ehlile ha e ntle.
When the time comes, of course.	Ha nako e fihla, ehlile.
But this did not help.	Empa sena ha sea ka sa thusa.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
They don't want to meet anyone.	Ha ba batle ho kopana le mang kapa mang.
Work on children.	Sebetsa ho bana.
But there is actually a higher truth than that.	Empa ha e le hantle ho na le 'nete e phahameng ho feta eo.
And yet.	Mme leha ho le jwalo.
I too have done a fine job.	Le 'na ke entse mosebetsi o motle.
We went with him to look.	Re ile ra ea le eena ho ea sheba.
And he knew the time was coming.	Mme o ne a tseba hore nako e a tla.
He says it is for the best.	O re ke bakeng sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
People buy books about good news.	Batho ba reka libuka tse buang ka litaba tse monate.
He had a name.	O ne a na le lebitso.
When we finally arrived, our group was exhausted.	Qetellong ha re fihla, sehlopha sa rōna se ne se khathetse.
I do not want them.	Ha ke ba batle.
In fact, he had it.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a e-na le eona.
I never used it again before I went to bed.	Ha kea ka ka e sebelisa hape pele ke robala.
No, that's not my point.	Che, ha se taba ea ka eo.
He did not think about the opportunity.	O ne a sa nahana ka monyetla oo.
The bad news is that.	Litaba tse mpe li entse joalo.
I'm looking for a boyfriend.	Ke batla mohlankana.
John was very tired and went to bed early.	John o ne a khathetse haholo ’me a robala esale hoseng.
He left the room.	O ile a tsoa ka kamoreng eo.
And something happens.	Mme se seng se etsahala.
He felt that it was not his business.	O ne a na le maikutlo a hore ha se taba ea hae.
We will be in greater danger than we are now.	Re tla ba kotsing ho feta kamoo re leng ka teng hona joale.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
Because it does, of course.	Hobane e etsa joalo, ka sebele.
Nothing exists until everything is there.	Ha ho letho le teng ho fihlela tsohle li le teng.
But this does not have to be.	Empa sena ha sea lokela ho ba joalo.
What can we do about it?	Re ka etsa’ng ka see?
But he was.	Empa o ne a .
He was arrested.	O ile a tšoaroa.
Or just so we can wear it.	Kapa e le hore feela re ka e apara.
To me, my work is very enjoyable.	Ho 'na, mosebetsi oa ka o monate haholo.
But he will get in there.	Empa o tla kena teng.
Yes, he could have done some of those things.	E, o ne a ka etsa tse ling tsa lintho tseo.
We have questions.	Re na le lipotso.
I wanted to be special.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba oa bohlokoa.
You have to do both.	U tlameha ho li etsa ka bobeli.
He is a father.	O ntate.
There was a problem.	Ho ne ho e-na le bothata.
I wish there was a way to be sure.	Ke lakatsa eka ho ka be ho na le tsela ea ho ba le bonnete.
It was him too.	E ne e le eena le eena.
And the parents want to come.	'Me batsoali ba batla ho tla.
Well, maybe this is already happening.	Ha e le hantle, mohlomong sena se se se ntse se etsahala.
Everything else has to go.	Lintho tse ling tsohle li tlameha ho tsamaea.
Some of the toys took hours.	Tse ling tsa lintho tsa ho bapala li ile tsa nka lihora tse ngata.
He refused and asked her to leave.	O ile a hana eaba o mo kōpa hore a tsamaee.
He wanted this.	O ne a batla sena.
Think about each of these questions carefully.	Nahana ka e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe ea lipotso tsena ka hloko.
Moreover, there are many of them.	Ho feta moo, ho na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
I don't think I can go back to this place.	Ha ke nahane hore nka khutlela sebakeng sena.
Some people do, while others do not.	Batho ba bang ba etsa joalo, ha ba bang ha ba etse joalo.
The worst.	E mpe ka ho fetisisa.
This is a difficult question.	Ena ke potso e thata.
He was emotional.	O ne a e-na le maikutlo.
All of these things are new.	Lintho tsena kaofela li ncha.
I looked at it and saw nothing.	Ke ile ka e sheba ke sa bone letho.
I think you will enjoy it too.	Ke nahana hore le uena u tla mo thabela.
And, of course, they did.	Mme, ehlile, ba ile ba etsa jwalo.
We are still wondering why, so far.	Re ntse re ipotsa hore na hobaneng, ho fihlela joale.
Sometimes he felt very lonely.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a ikutloa a le mong haholo.
Very good thing.	Ntho e ntle haholo.
He seemed to know everyone.	O ne a bonahala a tseba bohle.
However, I was not sure how to use it.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke se na bonnete ba hore na u sebelisa joang.
But it is really difficult now.	Empa ehlile ho thata hona joale.
I don't know why you can't stay together.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha u sa khone ho lula hammoho.
No one else will sleep in it.	Ha ho motho e mong ea tla robala ho eona.
She went home to live with her parents.	O ile a ea hae ho ea lula le batsoali ba hae.
Maybe I was there at the time.	Mohlomong ke ne ke le teng ka nako eo.
Or do not believe in it.	Kapa u se ke ua lumela ho eona.
He'll be waiting, and he's waiting for it.	O tla be a emetse, mme a e emetse.
I got back to school.	Ke ile ka fihla morao sekolong.
However, he had much to learn now.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a lokelang ho ithuta tsona hona joale.
He works with me to get it from me.	O sebetsa le 'na ho e fumana ho 'na.
I really enjoyed my time there.	Ke thabetse nako ea ka haholo moo.
And it is now or never.	'Me ke hona joale kapa ha ho mohla.
Things were going well, except.	Lintho li ne li tsamaea hantle, ntle le.
It happened last year.	E etsahala selemong se fetileng.
Of course there are many things I can think of.	Ehlile ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo nka nahanang ka tsona.
Yes, he can.	Ee, a ka khona.
This did a good job.	Sena se ile sa etsa mosebetsi o motle.
It’s so easy that way.	Ho bonolo haholo ka tsela eo.
The expert asked many questions.	Setsebi seo se ile sa botsa lipotso tse ngata.
He always does well.	O dula a etsa hantle.
I will pay for it.	Ke tla e lefa.
There is another.	Ho na le e 'ngoe.
That we will have.	Eo re tla ba le eona.
I just wanted to look at things.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho sheba lintho.
Of course, no one can.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho motho ea ka khonang.
We can never do that again.	Re ke ke ra hlola re etsa joalo.
There was his chance.	Ho ne ho e-na le monyetla oa hae.
Nothing is coming.	Haho letho le tlang.
I have to make a decision.	Ke tlameha ho etsa qeto.
My husband was very good to me.	Monna oa ka o ne a le molemo haholo ho 'na.
I can't understand this.	Ha ke khone ho utloisisa sena.
We are here for one thing.	Re mona ka ntho e le 'ngoe.
We can be here.	Re ka ba mona.
One could not learn to say it.	Motho o ne a sitoa ho ithuta ho e bua.
I could no longer watch.	Ke ne ke se ke sa khone ho shebella.
He is one of them.	Ke e 'ngoe ea tsona.
I was making good money.	Ke ne ke etsa chelete e ntle.
That was a thought.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo.
His last night of life.	Bosiu ba hae ba ho qetela ba bophelo.
I recently became a doctor last year.	Ke sa tsoa ba ngaka selemong se fetileng.
I like that.	Ke rata seo.
It must have been very dangerous.	E tlameha ebe e ne e le kotsi haholo.
Do nothing, someday.	O seke wa etsa letho, matsatsi a mang.
The higher the better.	E phahameng e betere.
It hurts them.	Ho bohloko ho bona.
This was very nice.	Sena se ne se le ntle haholo.
No, that's not enough.	Che, ha hoa lekana.
I'll go home tomorrow and fix it.	Ke tla ea hae hosane ke il’o e lokisa.
More than enough.	Ho feta ho lekaneng.
Because he did not.	Hobane ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
They are the only way to survive.	Ke tsona feela mokhoa oa ho tsoela pele ho phela.
I have a job for you.	Ke na le mosebetsi bakeng sa hau.
He should not have done that.	O ne a sa lokela ho etsa jwalo.
However, he did not spend time with us.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a se na nako le rōna.
It is a possibility.	Ke ntho e ka etsahalang ruri.
He does not need to sleep.	Ha a hloke ho robala.
Now, the time is now.	Jwale, nako ke jwale.
When we arrived, we were able to enter without difficulty.	Ha re fihla re ne re khona ho kena ntle le bothata.
There was nothing he could do about it, really.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang ka eona, ruri.
Sometimes it is.	Ka linako tse ling ho ba joalo.
He had nothing to say.	O ne a sena seo a ka se buang.
But it is something.	Empa ke ntho e itseng.
And it does.	'Me e etsa joalo.
They met at a party.	Ba ile ba kopana moketeng.
The dog would know.	Ntja e ne e tla tseba.
They do very hard work.	Ba etsa mosebetsi o boima haholo.
There was pain there.	Ho ne ho e-na le bohloko moo.
‘The truth is that he can be very helpful.	’Nete ke hore a ka thusa haholo.
One is close to home at this time.	E 'ngoe e haufi le hae ka nako ena.
Yes, it was busy.	E, ho ne ho phathahane.
There is only this.	Ho na le sena feela.
Anyone can make a mistake.	Mang kapa mang a ka etsa phoso.
Some of us probably wouldn’t.	Ba bang ba rōna mohlomong ba ne ba ke ke.
But we are what we are.	Empa re seo re leng sona.
She wondered if there would be a baby there.	O ne a ipotsa hore na joale ho tla ba le ngoana moo.
I think that was what it was.	Ke nahana hore ke seo e neng e le sona.
I find it very difficult to trust people.	Ke fumana ho le thata haholo ho tšepa batho.
However, we now know that man is not equal.	Leha ho le joalo, hona joale rea tseba hore motho ha aa lekana.
They go with us.	Ba tsamaea le rona.
They wanted to be what they were not.	Ba ne ba batla ho ba seo ba seng sona.
There was not much going on.	Ho ne ho se tse ngata tse etsahalang.
There is nothing.	Ha ho letho.
I often talk to people about it.	Hangata ke bua le batho ka eona.
He started this way.	O ile a qala ka tsela ena.
Do the same with the man.	Etsa joalo ka monna.
And the pain did not matter.	'Me bohloko bo ne bo se na taba.
But if you made a mistake.	Empa haeba o entse phoso.
You can read the letter here.	U ka bala lengolo mona.
That's all.	Ho joalo feela.
I'm not going anywhere now.	Ha ke sa ea kae kapa kae hona joale.
Take a few years if you like.	Nka lilemo tse 'maloa haeba u rata.
I like reading.	Ke rata ho bala.
This can go on for hours.	Sena se ka tsoela pele ka lihora tse ngata.
But you know what people are saying.	Empa u tseba seo batho ba se buang.
Of course, he loved her.	Ehlile, o ne a mo rata.
I thought nothing of it.	Ke ne ke sa nahane letho ka eona.
I did not forget.	Ha kea ka ka lebala.
Can you go with me?	O ka tsamaea le 'na?
He considered the matter and decided.	O ile a nahana ka taba eo eaba o etsa qeto.
How fast can you travel?	U ka tsamaea kapele hakae?
He would let her know what she wanted.	O ne a tla mo lumella hore a nahane seo a se batlang.
Anything was no longer a matter.	Eng kapa eng e ne e se e se na taba.
He prepared dinner early in the morning.	O ile a lokisa lijo tsa mantsiboea esale hoseng.
Hang.	Hang.
He left.	O ile a tloha.
We know how that happened.	Rea tseba hore na seo se ile sa etsahala joang.
Where should we go today?	Re lokela ho ea kae kajeno?
It would not work.	E ka be e sa sebetsa.
It seems easy to handle.	Ho bonahala ho le bonolo ho e tšoara.
So again, go ahead and win again!	Kahoo hape, tsoela pele 'me u hape!
People still want to do something.	Batho ba ntse ba batla ho etsa ho hong.
You can be no better than that.	O ka se be betere ho feta moo.
To you come in.	Ho uena kena.
He paused for a moment.	A ema ho se hokae.
The police arrested the boy.	Mapolesa a ile a tšoara moshanyana eo.
We do not understand that to the end.	Ha re utloisise seo ho fihlela qetellong.
It's almost fun.	E batla e le monate.
He could not have made such a mistake.	O ne a ke ke a etsa phoso e kang eo.
Or until they have no water.	Kapa ho fihlela ba se na metsi.
He certainly did not have it.	Ka sebele o ne a se na eona.
It was too late for me.	E ne e se e le morao haholo bakeng sa ka.
And he departed.	Mme a tloha.
Of course.	Ehlile.
We only have today.	Re na le kajeno feela.
Not so much.	Che haholo.
It was hard work.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima.
That's the time.	Ke nako eo .
He had it.	O ne a e-na le eona.
For your request.	Bakeng sa kopo ea hau.
There was no point in watching, he was tired.	Ho ne ho se na thuso ea ho shebella, o ne a khathetse.
We walk to school every day.	Re tsamaea ka maoto ho ea sekolong letsatsi le leng le le leng.
Be careful.	Tšoara ka hloko.
They had their time.	Ba bile le nako ya bona.
But it is not too late.	Empa nako ha e eso be morao haholo.
They never planned to leave.	Ho ne ho se mohla ba kileng ba rera ho tsamaea.
As if he did not want to talk.	Joalo ka ha a ne a sa batle ho bua.
One day the police may come.	Ka letsatsi le leng mapolesa a ka tla.
He knew something was wrong.	O ne a tseba hore ho na le ntho e makatsang.
I was alone again.	Ke ne ke le mong hape.
And so we moved on.	'Me kahoo re ile ra tsoela pele.
He made a party.	O ile a etsa mokete.
Probably all of us should be.	Mohlomong kaofela ha rōna re lokela ho ba joalo.
So that's a good thing too.	Kahoo le eona ke ntho e ntle.
But there is nothing we can do.	Empa ha ho letho leo re ka le etsang.
Well, except for one.	Hantle, ntle le e le 'ngoe.
Just last year.	Selemong se fetileng feela.
But it has never been his way.	Empa ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba tsela ea hae.
You have to give it up.	O tlameha ho e tlohela.
We could not go any further.	Re ne re ke ke ra tsamaea ho feta moo.
We can still enjoy it.	Re ntse re ka e thabela.
Or, you know, it's too early.	Kapa, ​​ua tseba, esale hoseng haholo.
I like this one more.	Ke rata ena ho feta.
Then there is the problem.	Joale ho na le bothata.
Doing my job.	Ho etsa ka mosebetsi oa ka.
Think, if you can.	Nahana, ha u ka khona.
But you have had yours since then.	Empa esale u na le ea hau ho tloha ka nako eo.
It would be his last professional season.	E ne e tla ba nako ea hae ea ho qetela ea setsebi.
And now no one would know him.	'Me joale ha ho motho ea neng a tla mo tseba.
As it could be.	Joalo ka ha e ka ba joalo.
The man is drinking water.	Monna o noa metsi.
It's much better now.	E betere haholo hona joale.
Notice that.	Hlokomela seo.
Now there is no time.	Joale ha ho na nako.
And the work paid off.	'Me mosebetsi oo o ile oa lefa.
I like being with people.	Ke rata ho ba le batho.
He refused to talk about it.	O ile a hana ho bua ka eona.
He did not sleep and walk in it.	Ha aa ka a robala a tsamaea ho eona.
However, I do not like to talk about him.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke rate ho bua ka eena.
Better after an accident than before.	Ho molemo ka mor'a kotsi ho feta leha e le neng pele.
Everyone needs a car today!	Motho e mong le e mong o hloka koloi kajeno!
One is too much.	E 'ngoe e ngata haholo.
You get some really cool stuff.	U fumana lintho tse monate haholo.
He would stand.	O ne a tla ema.
Instead, he looks down.	Ho e-na le hoo, o sheba fatše.
I would like to go.	Ke tla batla ho tsamaea.
You look good when you're done.	U shebahala hantle ha u qeta.
And we have to thank you.	Mme re na le ho o leboha.
This car is very powerful.	Koloi ena e matla haholo.
The local people refused to talk to us.	Batho ba moo ba ile ba hana ho bua le rōna.
And the last shall be first.	Mme ba morao e tla ba ba pele.
Of course, he knows more than that.	Ehlile, o tseba ho feta moo.
Of course, it can be very difficult.	Ha e le hantle, e ka ba boima haholo.
It knows the way.	E tseba tsela.
They love our team.	Ba rata sehlopha sa rona.
Now that is not the case.	Joale ha ho joalo.
You have to do it now, for real.	U lokela ho e etsa hona joale, ka 'nete.
The food is very tasty.	Lijo li monate haholo.
He wasted no time.	O ile a qeta nako.
The people did the same.	Batho le bona ba ne ba entse joalo.
He stood there and looked around.	A ema moo mme a sheba sebakeng.
But it does not matter.	Empa ha ho na taba.
We could not find a location.	Ha rea ​​fumana sebaka.
But it's fun.	Empa ho monate.
He drove.	O ile a khanna.
I don't care.	ha ke tsotelle.
I'm sorry about everything.	Ke masoabi ka tsohle.
It was my life.	E ne e le bophelo ba ka.
That will not help.	Seo ha se na ho thusa.
This was really very simple.	Sena se ne se hlile se le bonolo haholo.
I think he was looking forward to it.	Ke nahana hore o ne a e lebeletse.
It didn't matter to me.	Ho ne ho se taba ho nna.
Long time.	Nako e telele.
My house is your house as they say.	Ntlo ea ka ke ntlo ea hau joalo ka ha ba bolela.
That is hard work.	Oo ke mosebetsi o boima.
That's all.	Ho joalo feela.
She can't keep clothes on him.	A ke ke a boloka liaparo ho eena.
It's not that easy.	Ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
We can't stay here.	Re ke ke ra lula mona.
There are nice things out there in your room.	Ho na le lintho tse ntle ka ntle ho kamore ea hau.
For some reason that was evident hours ago.	Ka lebaka le itseng seo se ne se bonahala lihora tse fetileng.
I hope they love that child as much as before.	Ke tšepa hore ba rata ngoana eo joaloka pele.
Keep reading to learn more.	Tsoela pele ho bala ho ithuta haholoanyane.
They really make the days go by faster.	Ba hlile ba etsa hore matsatsi a tsamaee kapele.
Many believe him.	Ba bangata baa mo lumela.
This was no longer his room.	Ena e ne e se e se kamore ea hae.
We are not like you.	Ha re joalo ka uena.
I'm waiting for that.	Ke ntse ke emetse seo.
It was better you never met.	Ho ne ho le betere ha o eso kopane.
It was easy to do this.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho etsa sena.
I would get a second opinion.	Ke ne ke tla fumana maikutlo a bobeli.
We were at the end of our lives.	Re ne re le qetellong ea bophelo ba rōna.
It should be very simple.	E lokela ho ba bonolo haholo.
They will be back soon, though.	Ba tla khutla haufinyane, leha ho le joalo.
To him, though.	Ho eena, leha ho le joalo.
He found that it was good.	O ile a fumana hore ho molemo.
The same thing will happen with books.	Ho tla etsahala ntho e tšoanang ka libuka.
You have seen what it has done for us.	U bone seo e re entseng sona.
Now all we have is time, money and space.	Hona joale sohle seo re nang le sona ke nako, chelete le sebaka.
He agreed as soon as he did.	O ile a lumela hang ha a etsa joalo.
Well, nothing, really.	Hantle, ha ho letho, ka sebele.
Also, enter.	Hape, kena.
I don't care who you are or where you come from.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na o mang kapa o tsoa kae.
You know that will not happen.	Ua tseba hore hoo ho ke ke ha etsahala.
They eat it.	Ba e ja.
Then his children found him and came to him.	Joale bana ba hae ba mo fumana ’me ba tla ho eena.
They can always play together.	Ba ka bapala hammoho kamehla.
One can do this for a long time.	Motho a ka etsa sena ka nako e telele.
You do not have to ask anyone how they are doing.	Ha ua tlameha ho botsa mang kapa mang hore na ba ntse ba phela joang.
He is the only doctor in the area.	Ke eena feela ngaka sebakeng seo.
You would not know it by looking at us.	U ne u ke ke ua e tseba ka ho re sheba.
asked my father.	ha botsa ntate.
There was another man there.	Ho ne ho ena le monna e mong moo.
I need to sleep.	Ke hloka ho robala.
He had to think about what to do.	O ne a lokela ho nahana hore na a etse eng.
But he came with nothing.	Empa o ile a tla ntle le letho.
I didn't care.	ke ne ke sa tsotelle.
Something or someone.	Ntho kapa motho.
It doesn't matter here.	Ha ho na taba mona.
He could take them one at a time.	O ne a ka li nka e le ’ngoe ka nako.
Some of them are.	Ba bang ba bona ba.
He does this for everyone.	O etsa sena ho bohle.
It works for me !.	E sebetsa ho nna!.
My father is not there because he did not try.	Ntate ha a eo hobane ha aa ka a leka.
But this house has nothing wrong with it.	Empa ntlo ena ha e na letho le phoso ka eona.
That would be even more difficult.	Hoo ho ne ho tla ba thata le ho feta.
They are harmless to them.	Ba se na kotsi ho bona.
It's hard to say.	Ho thata ho bua.
This is not necessarily true except in this case.	Sena ha se hakaalo hore e le 'nete ntle le boemo bona.
Being able to think constantly.	Ho tseba ho nahana kamehla.
It took us a while to figure it out.	Ho ile ha re nka nako ho e utloisisa.
I love to write, so that comes in handy.	Ke rata ho ngola, kahoo seo sea kena.
Everyone knows what it looks like.	E mong le e mong oa tseba hore na e shebahala joang.
He could not get out of his way.	O ne a sa khone ho tsoa ka tsela ea hae.
And they kept talking together.	'Me ba tsoela pele ho bua hammoho.
You definitely should pass.	Ka sebele u lokela ho feta.
Not everyone does that.	Hase bohle ba etsang joalo.
We have to think.	Re tlameha ho nahana.
The children love it.	Bana ba e rata.
He is a fool.	O ntho e se nang kelello.
They did not, it seems.	Ha ba ka ba etsa jwalo, ho bonahala.
We may not hear them, but we know they exist.	Re ka ’na ra se ke ra li utloa, empa rea ​​tseba hore li teng.
That's what you do.	Ke seo o se etsang.
I just don't know what it is.	Ke mpa ke sa tsebe ke eng.
However, that is the idea.	Leha ho le joalo, oo ke mohopolo.
Then they really start to talk.	Joale ka sebele ba qala ho bua.
He called the police, but it was too late.	O ile a letsetsa mapolesa, empa e ne e se e le morao haholo.
I'm talking to myself.	Ke ntse ke bua ke le mong.
Now you are a man.	Joale u monna.
We do it in just one room.	Re li etsa ka kamoreng e le 'ngoe feela.
They had no children together.	Ba ne ba se na bana hammoho.
I saw you talking to that man.	Ke u bone u bua le monna eo.
One of his shoes is missing.	E 'ngoe ea lieta tsa hae ha e eo.
It was painful.	E ne e le bohloko.
It was nothing, really.	E ne e se letho, ka 'nete.
No arrests have been made.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a tšoaroa.
That is what we really wanted.	Ke sona seo re neng re hlile re se batla.
There was no one there.	Ho ne ho se na motho.
The rest doesn't matter.	Tse ling kaofela ha li na taba.
I just love it so much.	Ke e rata haholo feela.
I just want to look.	Ke batla ho sheba feela.
They need you more than you need this.	Ba u hloka ho feta kamoo u hlokang sena.
They need you when they need you.	Ba u hloka ha ba u hloka.
I am human.	Ke motho.
Do not wish more.	U se ke ua lakatsa ho feta.
I can't wait to try it.	Ke sitoa ho ema ho e leka.
First you have to ask.	Pele u tlameha ho botsa.
He knew the car.	O ne a tseba koloi.
People may have to think more.	Batho ba ka 'na ba tlameha ho nahana haholoanyane.
And he said now we have to talk.	Mme a re jwale re lokela ho bua.
When we first met, she was devastated.	Ha re qala ho kopana, o ne a utloile bohloko haholo.
There is nothing wrong with you baby.	Ha ho molato ho uena ngoana.
This place is still a bit busy today.	Sebaka sena se ntse se sebetsa hanyane kajeno.
All of this seemed like years to me.	Sena sohle se ne se bonahala e le lilemo ho 'na.
A similar situation exists here.	Boemo bo tšoanang bo teng mona.
Where needed.	Moo ho neng ho hlokahala.
There is nothing wrong with leaving right now.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka ho tsoa hona joale.
It can't go in here.	E ke ke ea kena ka mona.
There is plenty of room for you !.	Ho na le sebaka se ngata bakeng sa hau!.
Like.	Joalo ka.
It was fun here.	Ho ne ho le monate mona.
I decided to go.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho tsamaea.
Would you like to see it happen?	U ka rata ho bona ho etsahala eng?
I'm still there.	Ke ntse ke le teng.
But they felt there was something in it.	Empa ba ne ba ikutloa hore ho na le ho hong ho eona.
The problem is that they never are.	Bothata ke hore ha ho mohla ba joalo.
Then he knew what it was.	Joale o ne a tseba hore na ke eng.
Eventually, he wrote the book he was working on.	Qetellong, o ile a ngola buka eo a neng a ntse a sebetsa ka eona.
We will fix them soon.	Re tla li lokisa haufinyane.
Maybe he couldn't.	Mohlomong o ne a sa khone.
If they were.	Haeba li ne li le teng.
But now we have to work very hard.	Empa joale re tlameha ho sebetsa ka thata haholo.
It also does not seem to work.	Hape ha e bonahale e sebetsa.
I beg to do so again.	Ke kopa ho etsa joalo hape.
I think they tried to do that.	Ke nahana hore ba ile ba leka ho etsa joalo.
It made my day then.	E entse letsatsi la ka nako eo.
I work every day.	Ke sebetsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
He certainly had never existed before.	Ruri o ne a eso be teng pele.
He was not an expert.	E ne e se setsebi.
Right here it was a mistake.	Hona mona e ne e le phoso.
I hope you are home and you feel better than before.	Ke tšepa hore u hae 'me u ikutloa u le betere ho feta pele.
Still, they seemed to enjoy it.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba bonahala ba e thabela.
It didn't have to be.	Ho ne ho sa tlameha ho ba teng.
They, too, looked very pretty.	Le bona ba ne ba shebahala ba le batle haholo.
This, of course, was a problem.	Ruri sena e ne e le bothata.
Then understand what it means.	Ebe u utloisisa hore na e bolela eng.
He was still hearing it.	O ne a ntse a e utloa.
She is a girl who does that.	Ke ngoanana ea etsang joalo.
He never talked about it.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka eona.
He had amazing hands.	O ne a ena le matsoho a makatsang.
Many are still there.	Ba bangata ba ntse ba le teng.
He had something to say for this.	O ne a na le seo a lokelang ho se bua bakeng sa sena.
She and her baby.	Eena le ngoana oa hae.
Try to get a good night's sleep.	Leka ho robala hantle bosiu.
And some would be new.	'Me tse ling e ne e tla ba tse ncha.
It's very powerful, of course.	E matla haholo, ha e le hantle.
This has to happen.	Sena se lokela ho etsahala.
So, what are you going to do tonight?	Joale, u tla etsa joang bosiung bona?
I could have understood.	nka be ke ile ka utloisisa.
Enter.	Kena.
He was a father and a son.	E ne e le ntate le mora.
He was still thinking like that.	O ne a ntse a nahana joalo ka eena.
One last one.	E 'ngoe ea ho qetela.
He stood right behind me.	A ema hantle ka mora ka.
We make it easy.	Re e etsa e bonolo.
Any driving, of course.	Ho khanna efe kapa efe, ha e le hantle.
But the man did not listen.	Empa monna eo ha aa ka a utloa.
Probably a lot of things.	Mohlomong lintho tse ngata.
That accident is dangerous.	Kotsi eo e kotsi.
They read it all the time, it seems.	Ba e bala ka linako tsohle, ho bonahala.
I know better.	Ke tseba hantle.
It's hard to hear.	Ho thata ho utloa.
He's seen it happen before.	O kile a e bona e etsahala pele.
You don’t have to do anything like that again, do you understand.	Ha ua lokela ho etsa letho le joalo hape, na ua utloisisa.
However, it may be nothing.	Leha ho le joalo, e ka 'na eaba ha ho letho.
This is very clear.	Sena se hlakile haholo.
But that doesn't seem to be the case for some of them.	Empa hoo ha ho bonahale ho lekana ho ba bang ba bona.
I love them so much.	Ke ba rata haholo.
This seems too easy to come to a conclusion.	Sena se bonahala se le bonolo haholo ho fihlela qeto.
We have everything we want, you know.	Re na le tsohle tseo re li batlang, ua tseba.
I just know that sometimes it will be hard.	Kea tseba feela hore ka linako tse ling ho tla ba thata.
He wants to be with others like him.	O batla ho ba le ba bang ba kang eena.
You must provide both.	U tlameha ho fana ka bobeli.
He knows what he is going to say before he says it.	O tseba seo a tla se bua pele a se bua.
We are in space.	Re sebakeng.
It was moving.	E ne e ntse e tsamaea.
We do that a lot.	Re etsa joalo haholo.
I am not to blame for everything.	Ha ke na molato bakeng sa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
This may be true, and it may not be.	Sena se ka 'na sa e-ba 'nete, 'me e ka 'na eaba ha se joalo.
Or maybe not.	Kapa mohlomong ha ho joalo.
They know we have to do something right now.	Baa tseba hore re tlameha ho etsa ho hong ka hona joale.
I really don't like it.	Ha ke hlile ha ke e rate.
Something is wrong here.	Ho na le phoso mona.
And so it was.	Mme ho bile jwalo.
You need to give people time.	U lokela ho fa batho nako.
It was a surprise for both of us.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang ho rona ka bobeli.
There is nothing wrong with that, if you have it once in a while.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka eona, haeba u e-na le eona hang ka nako.
You may have seen that.	Mohlomong u kile ua bona seo.
He will do a great job.	O tla etsa mosebetsi o moholo.
How to do it and what to take.	Mokhoa oa ho e etsa le seo u lokelang ho se nka.
You are not logged in.	Ha ua kena.
I told you before.	Ke le boleletse pele.
We must move on.	Re tlameha ho tsoela pele.
And for me.	Le bakeng sa ka.
However, things are not that simple today.	Leha ho le joalo, lintho ha li bonolo hakaalo kajeno.
As always, he needed that money.	Joaloka kamehla, o ne a hloka chelete eo.
I looked at them.	Ka ba sheba.
And sometimes that works.	'Me ka linako tse ling seo sea sebetsa.
They want to look their best.	Ba batla ho shebahala ba hlakile haholo.
However, it was not.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se eona.
His textbooks must have been in school.	E tlameha ebe libuka tsa hae tsa sekolo li ne li le sekolong.
By tomorrow.	Ka nako hosane.
I think we are here to live a good life.	Ke nahana hore re mona ho tla phela bophelo bo monate.
Indeed, it is far more valuable.	Ka sebele, e feta molemo.
The last time was today, so we started.	Nako ea ho qetela e ne e le kajeno, kahoo re ile ra qala.
My friends were crying.	Metsoalle ea ka e ne e lla.
Maybe not so bad.	Mohlomong ha se ntho e mpe hakaalo.
It had been a long time.	E ne e se e le nako e telele.
But it was not enough in some way.	Empa e ne e sa lekana ka tsela e itseng.
But he would end the matter.	Empa o ne a tla qeta taba ena.
I really think this will help.	Ka sebele ke nahana hore sena se tla thusa.
They are delicious!	Li monate!
We start asking everything.	Re qala ho botsa tsohle.
He did not stay for himself.	O ne a sa ka a dula bakeng sa hae.
We'll see you tomorrow.	Re tla u bona hosane.
We wanted to get out.	Re ne re batla ho tsoa.
I need help.	Ke kopa thuso.
But they are not mine.	Empa hase ba ka.
By no means would it be!	Ho hang ho ne ho tla bonahala eka ha ho joalo.
I never played again.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke bapala.
He had to see this coming.	O ne a lokela ho bona sena se tla.
They have no idea about it.	Ha ba na maikutlo ka eona.
I stared at her intently.	Ke ile ka mo shebella ka hloko.
But they knew and could see who had done it.	Empa ho ne ho tseba mme ho ne ho bona hantle hore na ke mang ea entseng joalo.
However, this applies to both.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se sebetsa ka bobeli.
Only one of them works.	E 'ngoe feela ea tsona e sebetsa.
He has no real friends.	Ha a na metsoalle ea sebele.
We will have to learn from that.	Re tla lokela ho ithuta ho seo.
Maybe you can too.	Mohlomong le uena u ka etsa joalo.
Great job.	Mosebetsi o moholo.
Someone looked at her with questions.	E mong o ile a mo sheba ka lipotso.
That was bad.	Seo se ne se le mpe.
What are you going to.	O ya ho eng.
She went to give the baby to her mother.	O ile a ea fana ka ngoana ho 'mè oa hae.
In this area and over time you can make a mistake.	Sebakeng sena le ha nako e ntse e ea u ka etsa phoso.
It is not.	Ha se eona.
Some are talking.	Ba bang ba ntse ba bua.
He was still not looking his way.	O ne a ntse a sa sheba tsela ya hae.
I feel better knowing that.	Ke ikutloa ke le betere ho tseba seo.
They are not children, just fine.	Ha se bana, hantle feela.
I believe they should have a legal system.	Ke lumela hore ba lokela ho ba le mokhoa oa molao.
You would not think so.	O ka se nahane jwalo.
I could not see them.	Ke ne ke sa ba bone.
We will ask everyone for this.	Re tla kopa bohle ho sena.
But you can't always be that way.	Empa u ke ke ua lula u le joalo.
People like you.	Batho ba kang uena.
It was just true.	E ne e le 'nete feela.
Maybe that will come with time.	Mohlomong tseo li tla tla le nako.
We are not sure if he is one of us.	Ha re na bonnete ba hore ke e mong oa rona.
They are of this type.	Ke ba mofuta ona.
I can’t start too early for things like that.	Ha ke khone ho qala esale pele haholo bakeng sa lintho tse joalo.
That seems to help with pain.	Seo se bonahala se thusa ka bohloko.
I don't know him very well.	Ha ke mo tsebe hakaalo.
He could not stand.	O ne a sitoa ho ema.
I know his style.	Ke tseba mokhoa oa hae.
I will never ask you again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke o botsa.
She knew the man was waiting for her.	O ne a itse monna o ne a mo emetse.
Talking to someone often does.	Ho bua le motho e mong hangata ho etsa joalo.
I will take care of her.	Ke tla mo hlokomela.
Children's shoes should be comfortable and easy to get into.	Lieta tsa bana li lokela ho ba bonolo 'me ho be bonolo ho kena ho tsona.
But that thing.	Empa ntho eo.
This is for the best.	Sena ke bakeng sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
And we will never be there again.	Hape re ke ke ra hlola re e-ba teng.
I could not live without you.	Ke ne nke ke ka phela ntle le uena.
Decide and see it to the end.	Etsa qeto 'me u e bone ho fihlela qetellong.
We all had a great time.	Kaofela re bile le nako e monate.
I like being with me.	Ke rata ho ba nna.
Though they did not have it, they soon believed.	Leha ba ne ba se na eona, kapele ba lumela.
You cannot win time or years.	U ke ke ua hlola nako kapa lilemo.
If there can be any help.	Haeba ho ka ba le thuso efe kapa efe.
These are my things.	Tsena ke lintho tsa ka.
Even if they could do this today, it would be too late.	Leha ba ka etsa sena kajeno, e ka be e se e le morao haholo.
I will be back very early in the morning.	Ke tla khutla hoseng haholo.
I understand now.	Kea utloisisa joale.
Today was the day.	Kajeno e ne e le letsatsi.
Go away, young man.	Tloha, mohlankana.
They refused to talk to me after that.	Ba ile ba hana ho bua le ’na ka mor’a moo.
Then it was my turn.	Joale e ne e le monyetla oa ka.
I didn't have to say anything.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho bua letho.
Just live here.	Phela mona feela.
I make things harder than they really are.	Ke etsa hore lintho li be thata ho feta kamoo li leng kateng.
I was all his.	Ke ne ke le tsohle tsa hae.
I will try my best to start today.	Ke tla leka ka matla ho qala kajeno.
He understood very well.	O ne a utloisisa hantle.
And they think they know how good that is.	Mme ba nahana hore ba tseba kamoo seo se leng molemo kateng.
They were alive.	Ba ne ba phela.
He would like to see if she is OK.	O ne a ka rata ho bona hore na o hantle.
It just starts.	E qala feela.
I want to say it.	Ke batla ke e bolela.
I have an idea of ​​what we can do.	Ke na le mohopolo oa seo re ka se etsang.
Nothing always.	Ha ho letho kamehla.
It really seems like everyone had a great time.	Ka sebele ho bonahala eka motho e mong le e mong o bile le nako e monate.
He had to tell me these things.	O ile a tlameha ho mpolella litaba tsena.
He heard something give.	O ile a utloa ho hong ho fana.
It's dog life.	Ke bophelo ba ntja.
But in it !!.	Empa ho eona!!.
We're going to look.	Re ya sheba.
I'm just waiting.	Ke emetse feela.
I will fall.	ke tla oa.
There may be.	Ho ka ba teng.
The man could not take care of her.	Monna o ne a sitoa ho mo hlokomela.
We saw it last night.	Re e bone maobane bosiu.
He was a hard man to forget.	E ne e le motho ya thata ho lebala.
Each of them had some authority.	E mong le e mong oa bona o ne a e-na le matla a itseng.
When my father died, he came to live with us.	Ha Ntate a hlokahala, o ile a tla ho lula le rōna.
He had no reason to retreat.	O ne a se na lebaka la ho khutlela morao.
But now is not the time to act.	Empa joale ha se nako ea ho etsa.
However, it is best not to drink too much before or during that time.	Leha ho le joalo, ho molemo hore u se ke ua noa haholo pele kapa nakong eo.
Even if it is just as important.	Leha e ka ba ea bohlokoa feela.
But we need to feel in place.	Empa re lokela ho ikutloa re le sebakeng.
He really enjoyed his work.	O ne a thabela mosebetsi oa hae haholo.
I know their power.	Ke tseba matla a bona.
The party was very fun.	Mokete o ne o le monate haholo.
I knew it would be so.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ho tla ba joalo.
We have always met.	Haesale re kopana.
I have no idea.	Ha ke na maikutlo.
But he was more than that.	Empa o ne a feta moo.
Very good from him.	E ntle haholo ho tsoa ho eena.
Then it was time to leave.	Joale ho ne ho se ho tsamaea.
But he should be glad to see her.	Empa o lokela ho thabela ho mo bona.
You did this with your mind.	U entse sena ka kelello ea hau.
Moreover, the issue is complex.	Ho feta moo, taba ena e thata.
Work on it.	Sebetsa ho eona.
I had to get out of it.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tsoa ho eona.
That is their chance.	Ke monyetla oa bona oo.
It was here before.	E bile mona pele.
Yes, you are just a man of that.	E, u monna feela oa seo.
We believe that, and sometimes that will happen.	Re lumela seo, 'me ka linako tse ling seo se tla etsahala.
I usually don’t do this.	Hangata ha ke etse sena.
I did not know where he lived at the time.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na o lula hokae ka nako eo.
It would not be the last time, either.	E ka be e se lekhetlo la ho qetela, le hona.
Yes, we went through it.	E, re ile ra feta ho eona.
Maybe when you read more.	Mohlomong ha u bala haholoanyane.
I'm happy tomorrow.	Ke thabetse hosane.
There is none here.	Haho le teng mona.
You will never get a chance to do that.	Ha ho mohla u tla fumana monyetla oa ho etsa joalo.
I was not.	Ke ne ke se.
Some people are happy for someone they love.	Batho ba bang ba thabela motho eo ba mo ratang.
I learned that he too was important to her.	Ke ile ka ithuta hore le eena o ne a le bohlokoa ho eena.
I haven't been here long enough.	Ha kea lula mona nako e lekaneng.
You will love it !.	O tla e rata!.
But people do.	Empa batho ba etsa joalo.
It means we have a long time to fix things.	Ho bolela hore re na le nako e telele ea ho lokisa lintho.
I really enjoy watching other people suffer.	Ke thabela haholo ho shebella batho ba bang ba utloile bohloko.
My book only happens in both.	Buka ea ka e etsahala feela ka bobeli.
That is the danger we will have to take.	Ke kotsi eo re tla tlameha ho e nka.
It was clear that her parents did not like her.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore batsoali ba hae ba ne ba sa mo rate.
It was still alive.	E ne e ntse e phela.
In my opinion, we are better than they are.	Ka maikutlo a ka, re ba betere ho feta bona.
I think that would be great.	Ke nahana hore hoo ho tla ba hantle haholo.
It works well.	E sebetsa hantle.
Then he comes back to me.	Ebe o khutlela ho 'na.
Which they would not have enjoyed any more.	E leng seo ba neng ba ke ke ba se thabela ho feta.
Keeping it simple.	Ho e boloka e le bonolo.
There is no chance at all.	Haho monyetla ho hang.
Until now, everything was going his way.	Ho fihlela joale, ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e ne e tsamaea ka tsela ea hae.
So, no problems.	Kahoo, ha ho na mathata.
I think we did.	Ke nahana hore re entse joalo.
You can try.	U ka leka.
She was so beautiful.	O ne a le motle hakaalo.
I just want to get out of here.	Ke batla ho tsoa mona feela.
I slept a lot or slept a lot.	Ke ne ke robala haholo kapa ke robala haholo.
I felt that way.	Ke ne ke ikutloa joalo.
I'm one of them now.	Ke e mong wa bona jwale.
It's fun to watch.	E monate ho e shebella.
These are just ideas.	Tsena ke maikutlo feela.
The same is true here.	Ho joalo le mona.
I just liked playing with a boy.	Ke ne ke rata ho bapala le moshanyana feela.
Life here is not easy.	Bophelo ba mona ha bo bonolo.
She cried.	A lla.
Although he was.	Leha a ne a .
Because we are human.	Hobane re batho.
Of course it was useless.	Ehlile ho ne ho se na thuso.
I don't want to be anywhere near you.	Ha ke batle ho ba kae kapa kae haufi le uena.
Very sad news.	Litaba tse bohloko haholo.
I would pay to see him again.	Ke ne ke tla lefa ho mo bona hape.
But, really, that’s your problem.	Empa, ehlile, ke bothata ba hau.
He was innocent.	O ne a se na molato.
I'm not going well.	Ha ke tsamaee hantle.
That's where the money is.	Ke hona moo chelete e leng teng.
They are close to home.	Ba haufi le hae.
I often study things long before anyone else knows them.	Hangata ke ithuta lintho nako e telele pele motho e mong a ka li tseba.
And maybe not.	'Me mohlomong ha ho joalo.
There must be a better way!	E tlameha ebe ho na le tsela e betere!
Maybe more.	Mohlomong ho feta.
You didn't notice.	Ha ua ka ua hlokomela.
I have to talk to him.	Ke tlameha ho bua le eena.
That was the fun of it all.	Eo e ne e le monate oa eona kaofela.
It does not seem easy to do so.	Ho bonahala eka ha ho bonolo ho etsa joalo.
Sleep as late at night as you can.	Robala bosiu haholo kamoo u ka khonang.
He is repairing it.	O ntse a e lokisa.
And don't make a mistake, that's what he was.	Mme o seke wa etsa phoso, ke seo a neng a le sona.
This would require money.	Sena se ne se tla hloka chelete.
You are coming after me.	U ntse u tla ka mor'a ka.
I really wanted to give you a chance.	Ke ne ke hlile ke batla ho u fa monyetla.
His mother died when he was a boy.	’Mè oa hae o ile a hlokahala e sa le moshanyana.
He represented all.	O ne a emetse bohle.
You hear everyone and everything.	U utloa bohle le tsohle.
But we did not know it.	Empa re ne re sa e tsebe.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
It was as if everyone was working in the same room.	E ne eka motho e mong le e mong o ne a sebetsa ka kamoreng e le 'ngoe.
Then he would resume his work.	Joale o ne a tla tsoela pele ka mosebetsi oa hae.
That's none of my business.	Ha se taba ea ka eo.
I could see that he did not care.	Ke ne ke bona hore ha a tsotelle letho.
They will meet.	Li tla kopana.
You do not have to speak up for one.	Ha ua tlameha ho bua ho fihlela e le 'ngoe.
I can only drive one car at a time.	Ke khona ho khanna koloi e le 'ngoe feela ka nako.
Traveling was not very difficult.	Ho tsamaea ho ne ho se thata haholo.
He'll stay here, too.	O tla dula mona, le nna.
You can do nothing.	O ka se etse letho.
They have never had children.	Ha ba eso be le bana.
He probably did not know anyone there.	Mohlomong o ne a sa tsebe motho moo.
Look here.	Sheba mona.
Well, she went with her husband.	Be, o ile a tsamaea le monna oa hae.
We had a great time today.	Re bile le nako e monate kajeno.
That was the way it should be.	Ho ne ho le kamoo ho neng ho lokela ho ba kateng.
But there is no such thing.	Empa ha ho ntho e joalo.
The children are innocent.	Bana ha ba na molato.
It has never been.	Ha ho eso be teng.
Nobody likes him.	Ha ho motho ea mo ratang.
But then he decided to try something else.	Empa joale o ile a etsa qeto ea ho leka ntho e ’ngoe hape.
I'll see you in the morning.	Ke tla o bona hoseng.
I did not like this book.	Ha kea ka ka rata buka ena.
This is to keep it.	Sena ke ho e boloka.
In fact, the process is the only way to do things.	Ha e le hantle, mokhoa oa ho etsa lintho ke mokhoa feela oa ho etsa lintho.
But they are not.	Empa ha ba eo.
We could help them a little.	Re ne re ka ba thusa hanyane.
So take care of this place.	Kahoo hlokomela sebaka sena.
But you did not say.	Empa ha ua ka ua bolela.
This was difficult for all of them to understand.	Sena se ne se le thata hore kaofela ha bona ba se utloisise.
Or, well, anyone.	Kapa, ​​hantle, mang kapa mang.
There must be a better way to do this.	Ho tlameha ho be le mokhoa o betere oa ho etsa sena.
No one has ever seen it.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a e bona.
I want to try that today.	Ke batla ho leka seo kajeno.
He certainly did not have to work so hard.	Ruri o ne a sa tlameha ho sebetsa ka thata hakaalo.
He needed money.	O ne a hloka chelete.
Moreover at times, he thought.	Ho feta moo ka linako tse ling, o ne a nahana.
Yet it is easy to forget this.	Leha ho le joalo ho bonolo ho lebala sena.
The children had to play outside.	Bana ba ne ba tlameha ho bapala ka ntle.
When you know you got it.	Ha u tseba hore u e fumane.
It didn’t go away alone, mind.	Ha ea ka ea tsamaea a le mong, kelello.
He wanted to do everything.	O ne a batla ho etsa tsohle.
I think everything is better if you can make it fun.	Ke nahana hore ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e molemo ha u ka e etsa hore e be monate.
It's just money.	Ke chelete feela.
They are not the same group.	Ha se sehlopha se le seng.
But those are really old books.	Empa tseo ehlile ke libuka tsa khale.
I did not think this well.	Ke ne ke sa nahana sena hantle.
I hope it goes well.	Ke tšepa hore e tla tsamaea hantle.
I want you to know that.	Ke batla hore o tsebe seo.
He could understand why they did not understand.	O ne a utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba ne ba sa utloisise.
Somehow, maybe it was better.	Ka tsela e itseng, mohlomong ho ne ho le betere.
He refused to say anything.	A hana ho bua letho.
Of course, he did not care.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a sa tsotelle.
Anyone can do any job.	Mang kapa mang a ka etsa mosebetsi ofe kapa ofe.
You can find him here.	U ka mo fumana mona.
It finally does something for me.	Qetellong e etsa ho hong ho nna.
He knows it won't be easy.	O a tseba hore ho ke ke ha eba bonolo.
I like that.	Ke rata seo.
But you work very well, and we need you.	Empa u sebetsa hantle haholo, 'me rea u hloka.
I know a doctor.	Ke tseba ngaka.
Do not go home at night.	U se ke ua ea hae bosiu.
Find out how much you can save.	Fumana hore na u ka boloka chelete e kae.
The police arrested him.	Mapolesa a mo tšoara.
So he finally gave up.	Kahoo qetellong o ile a e tlohela.
This is true of most people there.	Sena ke 'nete bakeng sa batho ba bangata ba teng.
You know, it makes you a stronger person.	Ua tseba, ho etsa hore u be motho ea matla le ho feta.
We moved on.	Re ile ra tsoela pele.
There was so much food!	Ho ne ho e-na le lijo tse ngata haholo!
He started walking.	O ile a qala ho tsamaea.
He learns well and often helps us.	O ithuta hantle 'me hangata oa re thusa.
She had a husband with her.	O ne a e-na le monna le eena.
We should not.	Ha rea ​​lokela.
My kids can't go out and play here.	Bana ba ka ba ke ke ba tsoela ka ntle ho ea bapala mona.
We all know how useless he is.	Kaofela rea ​​tseba hore na ha a na thuso hakae.
There was only room to stand.	Ho ne ho e-na le sebaka sa ho ema feela.
I do not have enough energy.	Ha ke na matla a lekaneng.
I want to start this.	Ke batla ho qala sena.
I see that now.	Ke bona seo ha jwale.
This is because you say yes, and you refuse.	Ena ke hore o re e, mme o hana.
It would be a mistake not to do so.	E tla be e le phoso ho se etse joalo.
You can be anything you want.	O ka ba eng kapa eng eo o e batlang.
They were just there.	Ba ne ba le teng feela.
He did not know that no one would arrest him.	O ne a sa tsebe hore ha ho motho ea tla mo tšoara.
They would not have known of his pain.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba tseba ka bohloko ba hae.
Thanks for watching !!.	Kea leboha ka ho shebella !!.
It is not a big job if you do it well.	Ha se mosebetsi o moholo haeba u o etsa hantle.
I think this is it.	Ke nahana hore sena ke sona.
I told her that if she wanted to go, she could go.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore haeba u batla ho tsamaea u ka tsamaea.
Yet he says nothing.	Leha ho le joalo ha a bue letho.
We can never.	Ha ho mohla re ka khonang.
That is what most people do.	Ke seo batho ba bangata ba se etsang.
He would be sure that he would not stay long.	O ne a tla ba le bonnete ba hore a ke ke a lula nako e telele.
I mean it's up to you.	Ke bolela hore ho ho uena.
They knew what he had done.	Ba ne ba tseba seo a se entseng.
The process is simple.	Mokhoa o bonolo.
Now that's what you need to do.	Joale ke seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
Now he has no place here because of her.	Hona joale ha a na sebaka mona ka lebaka la hae.
Of course they do.	Ehlile ba a bua.
But it is no longer an important issue.	Empa ha e sa le taba ea bohlokoa.
Look at her hair.	Sheba moriri oa hae.
Whatever it is.	Leha e ka ba eng.
I couldn't do it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e etsa.
It was very easy to use.	E ne e le bonolo haholo ho e sebelisa.
Also, record the time to cry.	Hape, ngola nako ea ho lla.
It is difficult to drink.	Ho thata ho noa.
He came often and stayed for a long time.	O ne a tla hangata mme a dula nako e telele.
No one refused.	Ha ho ea ileng a hana.
She was a beautiful girl.	E ne e le ngoanana e motle.
Your feet will thank you for this.	Maoto a hau a tla u leboha ka sena.
We know we both live here.	Rea tseba hore re lula mona ka bobeli.
It was exactly what you can think of.	E ne e le hantle seo o ka se nahanang.
And probably never.	'Me mohlomong ha ho mohla.
I was even starting to look forward to writing something.	Ke ne ke bile ke qala ho lebella ho ngola ho hong.
They don't know the law.	Ha ba tsebe molao.
My opinion is that some very good things are happening.	Maikutlo a ka ke hore ho na le lintho tse ntle haholo tse etsahalang.
They never had a chance.	Ha ba ka ba ba le monyetla.
The specialist was very helpful.	Setsebi se ne se thusa haholo.
I have heard a lot about this.	Ke utloile haholo ka sena.
But this is not a harmless fun.	Empa sena ha se monate o se nang kotsi.
Only you can do that.	Ke uena feela ea ka etsang joalo.
You do not have to do anything else.	Ha o sa tlameha ho etsa letho hape.
This is not difficult to understand.	Sena ha se thata ho se utloisisa.
We agreed to talk again in the morning.	Re ile ra lumela ho bua hape hoseng.
Have a nice day?	Ho ba le letsatsi le monate?
Maybe I'll learn from them.	Mohlomong ke tla ithuta ho tsona.
So why did the boy do that?	Joale ke hobane’ng ha moshanyana eo a ile a etsa joalo?
But we are afraid he will.	Empa re tšaba hore o tla etsa joalo.
They will not find it.	Ba ke ke ba e fumana.
This is a form of pain.	Ena ke mofuta oa bohloko.
This can be dangerous.	Sena e ka ba kotsi.
Mary could not call.	Maria o ne a sitoa ho letsa.
I took mine too.	Ke nkile ea ka le 'na.
He would buy the book.	O ne a tla reka buka eo.
But we do not see how.	Empa ha re bone hore na ho joang.
It's just beautiful.	E ntle feela.
You can do it yourself.	U ka e etsa u le mong.
Too many people have gone through it.	Ke batho ba bangata haholo ba fetileng ho eona.
Just last year, it happened.	Selemong se fetileng feela, ho bile joalo.
The problem is that they have not.	Bothata ke hore ha ba eso.
No one has ever done that.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a etsa joalo.
It may take some time.	Ho ka nka nako.
Because it is.	Hobane ho joalo.
Such work will not exist.	Mosebetsi o joalo o ke ke oa ba teng.
He didn't seem to find it.	O ne a bonahala a sa e fumane.
I think those three are very dangerous.	Ke nahana hore tse tharo tseo li kotsi haholo.
I felt tired.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke khathetse.
Or on foot.	Kapa ka maoto.
It should not exist.	Ha ea lokela ho ba teng.
The beautiful house was very nice.	Ntlo e ntle e ne e le ntle haholo.
I always forget something.	Ke dula ke lebala ho hong.
My decision is to leave now.	Qeto ea ka ke hore re tsamaee hona joale.
And the boy looked good.	Mme moshanyana o ne a shebahala hantle.
Get help now.	Fumana thuso hona joale.
You can stay home with us.	U ka lula hae le rona.
But they were talking because they loved people.	Empa ba ne ba bua hobane ba rata batho.
They know what they want and where to find it.	Ba tseba seo ba se batlang le hore na ba ka se fumana hokae.
So he looked at her.	Kahoo a mo sheba.
It's fun for you.	Ho monate ho uena.
The former were more numerous than the latter.	Ba pele ba ne ba le bangata ho feta ba morao.
I should not have gone to work today.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho kena mosebetsing kajeno.
Do not do this.	O seke wa etsa sena.
It is the only life that ever existed.	Ke bona feela bophelo bo kileng ba ba teng.
She has a high opinion of him.	O na le maikutlo a phahameng ka eena.
They were able to make an amazing decision.	Ba ile ba khona ho etsa qeto e makatsang.
He declined to comment.	O ile a hana ho fana ka maikutlo.
Then you get this thing back here.	Ebe o fumana ntho ena morao mona.
Make a group from time to time.	Etsa sehlopha nako le nako.
Drink water before eating.	Noa metsi pele u ja.
Opening is best.	Ho bula ho molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He said he liked it very much.	O ile a re o e rata haholo.
Things that may not work in the end.	Lintho tse ka 'nang tsa se ke tsa sebetsa qetellong.
Perhaps he did not hear her well.	Mohlomong o ne a sa mo utloa hantle.
Me and my parents.	'Na le batsoali ba ka.
Some will probably come in the future.	Tse ling mohlomong li tla tla nakong e tlang.
Now as long as we can keep it that way.	Jwale ha feela re ka e boloka e le jwalo.
I can't stay here with you.	Ha ke khone ho lula mona le uena.
The road, as it were, was invisible.	Tsela, kamoo e neng e le kateng, e ne e sa bonahale.
Quit.	Tlohela.
We were here.	Re ne re le mona.
Life is so good!	Bophelo bo monate haholo!
We are very happy.	Re thabile haholo.
I would have nothing now.	Ke ne nke ke ka ba le letho hona joale.
It's a very new thing.	Ke ntho e ncha haholo.
It does, and it must.	E etsa joalo, 'me e tlameha.
He used to swim a lot.	O ne a tloaetse ho sesa haholo.
It was your real kind.	E ne e le mofuta oa sebele oa hau.
It just looks good.	E shebahala hantle feela.
Look out, first of all.	Sheba ka ntle, pele ho tsohle.
If it can.	Haeba e ka khona.
We allow them to say so.	Re ba lumella ho bua joalo.
This is the best idea in my opinion.	Ena ke maikutlo a molemo ka ho fetisisa ho ea ka maikutlo a ka.
I only know what you need.	Ke tseba feela seo o se hlokang.
There are so many.	Ho na le tse ngata haholo.
We must learn to live with what we have.	Re tlameha ho ithuta ho phela ka seo re nang le sona.
This was incredibly powerful.	Sena se ne se le matla ka tsela e makatsang.
I loved talking to him.	Ke ne ke rata ho bua le eena.
Perhaps he did too.	Mohlomong le eena o ile a etsa joalo.
You will need your energy.	O tla hloka matla a hao.
No one else was going to do it.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong ea neng a tla etsa joalo.
But he must keep going.	Empa o tlameha ho tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
I understand your situation, but you must also understand mine.	Ke utloisisa boemo ba hau, empa le uena u tlameha ho utloisisa ea ka.
His wife wept.	Mosali oa hae a lla.
And he was right.	'Me o ne a bolela hantle.
Do your own thing.	Etsa ntho ea hau.
I will not buy a new car.	Ha ke tlo reka koloi e ncha.
And u.	'Me u.
Start with that, and that alone.	Qala ka seo, mme seo feela.
Everyone has to work from that.	E mong le e mong o tlameha ho sebetsa ho tsoa ho seo.
There seemed to be something he knew about her.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ho na le ntho eo a e tsebang ka eena.
Who said.	Ke mang ea itseng.
Think about your job.	Nahana ka mosebetsi oa hau.
I opened the front door.	Ke ile ka bula lemati le ka pele.
When things go well, there is nothing like it.	Ha lintho li tsamaea hantle, ha ho letho le tšoanang le lona.
It can never be true.	Ho hang e ke ke ea e-ba ’nete.
However, he did not consider doing his writing work.	Leha ho le joalo, ha aa ka a nahana ho etsa mosebetsi oa hae oa ho ngola.
No one wanted to read this book.	Ho ne ho se motho ea batlang ho bala buka ena.
He should not have known that but he knew, of course.	O ne a sa lokela ho tseba seo empa o ne a tseba, ehlile.
Some are sure.	Ba bang ba na le bonnete.
The young man did not know his job.	Mohlankana eo o ne a sa tsebe mosebetsi wa hae.
They are priorities, of course.	Ke lintho tse tlang pele, ehlile.
This was mine.	Ena e ne e le ea ka.
And the power will return.	'Me matla a tla khutla.
She believes him when she says she loves him.	Oa mo lumela ha a re oa mo rata.
Things of this nature.	Lintho tsa mofuta ona.
That will be fun.	Hoo ho tla ba monate.
He seemed to be in pain.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka o utloa bohloko.
They will eat him!	Ba tlo mo ja!
It would come.	E ne e tla tla.
Group in one day.	Sehlopha ka letsatsi le le leng.
The issue is now.	Taba e teng hona joale.
She looks at him and walks away every time he looks at her.	Oa mo sheba ebe oa tsamaea nako le nako ha a mo sheba.
If it seems, it is.	Haeba e bonahala, ho joalo.
I want to say that we know what we need to do.	Ke batla ho bolela hore re tseba seo re lokelang ho se etsa.
It cries again.	E lla hape.
We would do the night with it.	Re ne re tla etsa bosiu ka eona.
Live a better life.	Phela bophelo bo betere.
Close to most objects.	Haufi le lintho tse ngata.
It is my hard work.	Ke mosebetsi oa ka o boima.
We are good.	Re molemo.
This will not be easy or pleasant.	Sena se ke ke sa e-ba bonolo kapa se monate.
No, it would not have happened.	Che, e ka be e sa etsahala.
Breakfast was plentiful and very tasty.	Lijo tsa hoseng li ne li le ngata 'me li le monate haholo.
It is better to hope so.	Ho molemo ho tšepa joalo.
Things can be better.	Lintho li ka ba molemo.
Whether we like it or not.	Hore na rea ​​rata kapa che.
Or any other man.	Kapa monna ofe kapa ofe e mong.
I was not sure what to do with it.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na o tla etsa'ng ka eona.
But, you know?	Empa, na ua tseba?
Of course you know their stuff.	Ehlile tseba litaba tsa bona.
The couple looked at the phone.	Monna le mosali ba ile ba sheba mohala.
I could not get back.	Ke ne nke ke ka fihla morao.
Because you probably only hear what you want to hear.	Hobane mohlomong u utloa feela seo u batlang ho se utloa.
The family was in good health.	Lelapa le ne le phela hantle.
They've seen what they are.	Ba bone seo ba leng sona.
I came back.	Ke ile ka khutla.
It was a group, people.	E ne e le sehlopha, batho.
I'm sure this is it.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore sena ke sona.
It certainly was his.	Ka sebele e ne e le ea hae.
I wondered if he was home for the party.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na ebe o ne a le hae bakeng sa mokete oo.
We all love his stuff.	Kaofela re rata lintho tsa hae.
This coffee is very good.	Kofi ena e ntle haholo.
Leave things as they are.	Tlohela lintho kamoo li leng kateng.
It was harder work than a police car.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima ho feta koloi ea mapolesa.
But it is not enough.	Empa ha hoa lekana.
One goes in, the other goes out.	E mong oa kena, e mong oa tsoa.
We were only a few years old.	Re ne re e-na le lilemo tse seng kae feela.
For the first time.	Lekhetlo la pele.
They store some energy.	Ba boloka matla a itseng.
Everyone he loved.	E mong le e mong eo a neng a mo rata.
Before we know about any of this.	Pele re tseba ka eng kapa eng ea sena.
I thought he was at work.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o mosebetsing.
Tomorrow will be our last day here.	Hosane e tla be e le letsatsi la rona la ho qetela mona.
It is very difficult at times.	Ho thata haholo ka linako tse ling.
And then read it again.	Mme ebe o e bala hape.
You will have to do better in the future.	O tla tlameha ho etsa betere nakong e tlang.
Write your thoughts down.	Ngola maikutlo a hau fatše.
He is alive, as far as we know.	O a phela, ho ya kamoo re tsebang.
We hope you understand.	Re tšepa u utloisisa.
I have something for someone else.	Ke na le ho hong ho motho e mong.
But he soon realized what was happening.	Empa kapele o ile a hlokomela se etsahalang.
Everything happens for a reason.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e etsahala ka lebaka.
I had fun this week.	Ke bile monate bekeng ena.
He didn't care too much.	O ne a sa tsotelle haholo.
Here he had no job.	Mona o ne a se na mosebetsi.
And it tells us why it was so difficult to find them.	'Me e re bolella hore na ke hobane'ng ha ho bile thata hakana ho li fumana.
They did not want this.	Ba ne ba sa batle sena.
It makes you think.	E etsa hore u nahane.
But it is not good.	Empa ha e ntle.
I use it once a week.	Ke e sebelisa hang ka beke.
Of course it was not true at all.	Ke ’nete hore e ne e se ’nete ho hang.
But maybe he's at work now.	Empa mohlomong o mosebetsing hona joale.
Because of me, they were there.	Ka lebaka la ka, ba ne ba le teng.
It was as if he could see her.	E ne eka oa khona ho mo bona.
It was the first time I had seen it today.	Ke ne ke qala ho e bona kajeno.
Yes, her father is there.	E, ntate oa hae o teng.
Probably not.	Mohlomong o ne a ke ke a ba teng.
I just want feedback.	Ke batla maikutlo feela.
One looked happy.	E mong o ne a shebahala a thabile.
Again, this was another good way to think.	Hape, ena e ne e le mokhoa o mong o motle oa ho nahana.
I wish we could be friends.	Ke lakatsa eka re ka ba metsoalle.
People are trying to write him.	Batho ba leka ho mo ngola.
He could not help it.	O ne a ke ke a o thusa.
she cries.	oa lla.
Not me, of course.	Ha se le 'na, ka 'nete.
Then, we can do this in a simple or difficult way.	Joale, re ka etsa sena ka tsela e bonolo kapa e thata.
After the call.	Ka mor'a mohala.
What you want.	Seo u se batlang.
It does not matter.	Ha ho na taba.
Better now.	Ho betere hona joale.
Clearly, nothing like her.	Ho hlakile hore ha ho letho le tšoanang le la hae.
The same is true of others.	Ba bang le bona ba joalo.
It was hard, it was hard.	Ho ne ho le thata, ho le thata.
But that was not all.	Empa e ne e se hoo feela.
Except he did not speak.	Ntle le hore ha a ka a bua.
It opened up the floor for everyone else.	E ile ea bula fatše bakeng sa ba bang kaofela.
Always with the truth.	Ka linako tsohle ka 'nete.
This is not a good time to visit.	Ena ha se nako e ntle ea ho etela.
Yet many walk away feeling worse than before.	Leha ho le joalo ba bangata ba tsamaea ba ikutloa ba le mpe ho feta pele.
It was a really nice place.	E ne e le sebaka se setle ruri.
However he was not sure.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a sa tsebe hantle.
No one had ever thought of doing that before, either.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a nahana ho etsa joalo pele, le hona.
That's not what I want.	Ha se seo ke se batlang.
Our place is very beautiful.	Sebaka sa rona se setle haholo.
That was nothing.	Seo e ne e se letho.
We are sorry.	Re masoabi.
He enjoyed working there.	O ne a thabela ho sebetsa moo.
Is that the way we used to go?	Na ke tsela eo re kileng ra e tsamaea?
You can find one like this, man.	U ka fumana e tšoanang le ena, monna.
I want to live.	Ke batla ho phela.
See if this is still true.	Bona hore na sena e ntse e le 'nete.
I know some people wanted that.	Kea tseba hore batho ba bang ba ne ba batla seo.
Be careful!	Hlokomela!
First, they were not strong enough.	Ea pele, ba ne ba le sieo ka matla a lekaneng.
Now he could think.	Joale o ne a khona ho nahana.
Things were not going well.	Lintho li ne li sa tsamaee hantle.
I can't get out.	Ha ke khone ho tsoa.
He is the biggest in the team.	Ke eena e moholo sehlopheng.
He stayed well.	O ile a lula hantle.
Many people still trust them.	Batho ba bangata ba ntse ba li tšepa le kajeno.
We will be back!	Re tla khutla!
He would have really seen this.	O ne a tla be a hlile a bone sena.
I can't think or speak well.	Ha ke khone ho nahana kapa ho bua hantle.
I really think he meant what he said.	Ke hlile ke nahana hore o ne a bolela seo a se buileng.
It is very dangerous to call him.	Ho kotsi haholo ho mo letsetsa.
Now is the time to learn, and to learn quickly.	Joale ke nako ea ho ithuta, le ho ithuta kapele.
He refused to leave.	O ne a hana ho tloha.
It was very difficult at the time.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo ka nako eo.
And then there was food.	'Me joale ho ne ho e-na le lijo.
I did not want to.	Ke ne ke sa batle.
We will be tough. 	Re tla ba thata. 
in which.	eo ho eona.
I just looked like him.	Ke ne ke shebahala joaloka eena feela.
I've been waiting to do that for a long time.	Ke khale ke emetse ho etsa joalo.
It's a nice day.	Ke letsatsi le monate.
And they too will find it.	'Me le bona ba tla e fumana.
You can decide if you will wear them or not.	U ka etsa qeto ea hore na u tla li apara kapa che.
That's a good idea.	Ke mohopolo o motle.
Last week, no one had ever heard of him.	Bekeng e fetileng, ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a utloa ka eena.
What he did was obvious.	Seo a ileng a se etsa se ne se hlakile.
I live nearby.	Ke lula haufi.
For me it was really important to help people.	Ho ’na ho ne ho hlile ho le bohlokoa ho thusa batho.
Eventually you will wonder why you used to be afraid of them.	Qetellong u tla ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha u kile ua ba tšaba.
There is a lot of potential here already.	Ho na le monyetla o moholo mona o se o ntse o le teng.
You do not even know if these things exist.	Ha u tsebe le hore na lintho tsena li teng.
He came home late.	O ile a tla hae ka mor'a nako.
Before proceeding, consider the problem.	Pele u tsoela pele, nahana ka bothata.
She will go to school.	O tla ea sekolong.
You will not believe what happened today.	U ke ke ua lumela se etsahetseng kajeno.
Here it is! 	Ke eona ena!
he cried.	a lla.
It was no longer keeping that.	Ho ne ho se ho boloka seo.
Only you.	Ke wena feela.
I have no time.	Ha ke na nako.
He studied with her for a long time.	O ile a mo ithuta ka nako e telele.
I found a way to fix it.	Ke ile ka fumana mokhoa oa ho e lokisa.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
You have enough time.	U na le nako e lekaneng.
It really is another one.	Ha e le hantle ke e 'ngoe.
You can do whatever you want.	O ka etsa eng kapa eng eo o e hlokang.
It can be so here.	Ho ka ba joalo mona.
Everyone lived this way.	Batho bohle ba ne ba phela ka tsela ena.
It can't get enough books.	Ha e khone ho fumana libuka tse lekaneng.
I do not believe that.	Ha ke lumele seo.
He drinks a lot.	O noa haholo.
Don’t think or think.	U se ke ua nahana kapa ua nahana.
It allows you to save money on almost everything.	E u lumella ho boloka chelete hoo e batlang e le ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha se se etsahalang.
I'm sorry you didn't care.	Ke masoabi ha u e tsotelle.
By the time he returned, he was well behind.	Ha a khutla, o ne a se a le morao haholo.
He picked up the book and began to read.	O ile a nka buka eo ’me a qala ho bala.
It is taking and giving.	Ke ho nka le ho fana.
Something like this.	Ntho e kang ena le ena.
We do our best.	Re etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
You think you know everything about them.	U nahana hore u tseba tsohle ka bona.
We are not talking about that.	Ha re bue ka taba eo.
However, there was something else.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Somehow make him understand the point of coming here.	Ka tsela e itseng etsa hore a utloisise taba ea ho tla mona.
He was arrested by the police.	O ile a tšoaroa ke mapolesa.
Look ahead and see.	Sheba pele 'me u bone.
I don't like that.	Ha ke rate seo.
But then the hard work began.	Empa joale mosebetsi o boima o ile oa qala.
Really ???, what do they do to you ???.	Ha e le hantle ???, ba etsa'ng ho uena ???.
They can try to find out.	Ba ka leka ho fumana.
I hope this is good.	Ke tšepa hore sena se molemo.
Maybe he can find her.	Mohlomong a ka mo fumana.
They are accustomed to such things.	Ba tloaetse lintho tse joalo.
This was still his house.	Ena e ne e ntse e le ntlo ea hae.
We just got here for them.	Re sa tsoa fihla mona bakeng sa bona.
Don’t think about anything that happened last week.	U se ke ua nahana ka ntho leha e le efe e etsahetseng bekeng e fetileng.
Just that the girl was here.	Feela hore ngoanana o ne a le teng mona.
You would not understand.	U ne u ke ke ua utloisisa.
I have to do something.	Ke tlameha ho etsa ho hong.
But, this is nothing new.	Empa, sena ha se ntho e ncha.
I don't see that.	Ha ke bone seo.
It's bad for him.	E mpe bakeng sa hae.
But it can stand.	Empa e ka ema.
They have to buy together to stay together.	E tlameha ho reka hammoho ho lula hammoho.
Play with other children.	Bapala le bana ba bang.
Even here.	Le hona mona.
We tried and tried.	Re ile ra leka le ho leka.
I hope I am the only one.	Ke tšepa hore ke 'na feela.
She decided to have one child.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho ba le ngoana a le mong.
It was my first time out there.	E ne e le lekhetlo la ka la pele ke tsoa moo.
She keeps her feet on the ground.	O boloka maoto a hae fatše.
Long time no see.	Ke khale ke sa u bone.
I just live with my wife.	Ke mpa ke lula le mosali oa ka.
I would like to buy a house.	Ke kopa ho reka ntlo.
It's weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang.
When the time comes, you will need it.	Ha nako e fihla, o tla o hloka.
And you are.	Mme le le.
They spend their time saving energy for the fall.	Ba qeta nako ea bona ba boloka matla a bona bakeng sa ho oa.
Things are not easy for me right now.	Lintho ha li bonolo ho 'na hona joale.
They have money.	Ba na le chelete.
See books if needed.	Sheba libuka haeba ho hlokahala.
Knowing that it will return.	Ho tseba hore e tla khutla.
Understanding our feelings can be even more difficult.	Ho utloisisa maikutlo a rona ho ka ba thata le ho feta.
No one knew his real name.	Ho ne ho se motho ea tsebang lebitso la hae la sebele.
Not so much last year.	Ha se haholo selemong se fetileng.
I got out of it.	Ke ile ka tsoa ho eona.
She looked at the doctor.	A sheba ngaka.
Did you hear that?	Na u utloile seo?
He has been good to me.	O bile molemo ho nna.
The woman thought it was weird.	Mosali eo o ile a nahana hore ke ntho e makatsang haholo.
But he refused to cry.	Empa o ne a hana ho lla.
He was able to walk all the way.	O ile a khona ho tsamaea tsela eohle.
Just don't try it.	Feela u se ke ua e leka.
You will probably do the same, too.	Mohlomong u tla etsa joalo, le uena.
I loved working on it.	Ke ne ke rata ho sebetsa ho eona.
Good things to think about.	Lintho tse ntle tseo u ka nahanang ka tsona.
But he has a wonderful sense of humor.	Empa o na le kelello e monate e makatsang.
There were many things he did not know.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a neng a sa li tsebe.
Of course in the way he was just beginning to know.	Ehlile ka tsela eo a neng a qala ho e tseba.
I just have to do it.	Ke lokela ho e etsa feela.
We can say nothing.	Re ka se bue letho.
Only you and me now.	Ke 'na le uena feela joale.
It was over.	E ne e le ho feta.
Do whatever you want there.	Etsa eng kapa eng eo u e batlang moo.
I use it a lot.	Ke e sebelisa haholo.
And this approach should be better.	'Me mokhoa ona o lokela ho ba betere.
Not long ago, he believed that he would never see her again.	Ha se khale haholo, o ne a lumela hore ha a sa tla hlola a mo bona.
They still don't.	Ba ntse ba sa etse joalo.
Is anyone there?	Ho na le motho moo?
I would be happy to help you today.	Ke tla thabela ho u thusa kajeno.
There is a danger in that.	Ho na le kotsi ho seo.
I am a man.	Ke monna.
I say no.	Ke re ha ho joalo.
I am reading your new book.	Ke ntse ke bala buka ea hau e ncha.
They found him.	Ba mo fumane.
I do not want to see this.	Ha ke batle ho bona sena.
They were alone.	Ba ne ba le bang.
And tomorrow came again.	Mme hosane ha fihla hape.
Apparently she was still crying.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a ntse a lla.
Next.	E 'ngoe.
But we have to get out of here.	Empa re tlameha ho tloha mona.
Yet they can leave us.	Leha ho le joalo ba ka re tlohela.
I have to get out of here.	Ke tlameha ho tsoa mona.
He was reading.	O ne a ntse a bala.
Then her husband came in.	Eaba monna oa hae oa kena.
These are the ones.	Tsena ke tsona.
He was with me, though he was not.	O ne a e-na le ’na, leha a ne a le sieo.
But that was not your fault.	Empa hoo e ne e se phoso ea hao.
And they probably did.	'Me mohlomong ba ile ba etsa joalo.
That was probably the first time.	E ka 'na eaba leo e ne e le lekhetlo la pele.
None of us have ever seen or heard of him.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea kileng a bona kapa a utloa ka eena hape.
This happened every morning.	Sena se ile sa etsahala hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
Probably too much.	Mohlomong e ngata haholo.
He would do that.	O ne a tla etsa joalo.
And of course, my family is not alone.	'Me ho hlakile hore lelapa la ka ha le mong.
He would know if he had it.	O ne a tla tseba hore na o na le eona.
It is not visible.	Ha e bonahale.
A few were very mobile.	Tse seng kae li ne li tsamaea haholo.
He was just fine.	O ne a le hantle feela.
I told you what happened.	Ke le boleletse se etsahetseng.
And it will always be so.	Mme ho tla ba jwalo kamehla.
I ask again.	Ke botsa hape.
I think it's great for the phone.	Ke nahana hore e ntle haholo bakeng sa mohala.
He just wanted to sleep.	O ne a batla ho robala feela.
Anything we could think of.	Eng kapa eng eo re neng re ka e nahana.
Imagine that you are here to do so.	Nahana hore u mona ho etsa joalo.
Never say never.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua re ha ho mohla.
She was beautiful.	O ne o le motle.
I used my phone to help her see.	Ke ile ka sebelisa mohala oa ka ho mo thusa ho bona.
You have to stand on the ground.	U lokela ho ema fatše.
This is really fun.	Sena se hlile se monate.
You need to go.	U hloka ho tsamaea.
And, sadly, me.	'Me, ka masoabi, 'na.
I liked him very much at times, but for some it was not.	Ke ne ke mo rata haholo ka linako tse ling, empa ho ba bang ho ne ho se joalo.
Or something about that.	Kapa ntho e itseng ka seo.
This is a mistake.	Sena ke phoso.
What that should do.	Seo se lokela ho etsa eng.
You can see that from his work.	U ka bona seo mosebetsing oa hae.
No one else seemed to find it.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong ea neng a bonahala a e fumana.
We had no time.	Re ne re se na nako.
I do the same.	Le nna ke etsa seo.
We stayed for a week.	Re ile ra lula beke.
I just caught him.	Ke qeta ho mo tšoara.
I will take her.	Ke tlo mo nka.
Then something amazing happened.	Eaba ho etsahala ntho e makatsang.
That job meant traveling even more.	Mosebetsi oo o ne o bolela ho tsamaea le ho feta.
There seems to have been a recurrence.	Ho bonahala eka ho bile le ho khutla hape.
He knows he hasn't.	O a tseba hore ha a eso.
Amazing to think about.	E makatsang ho nahana ka eona.
He stood up and studied with me.	O ile a ema 'me a ithuta 'na.
He was confident, though.	O ne a tšepa, leha ho le joalo.
It seemed like such a good idea.	E ne eka ke mohopolo o motle hakana.
And singing.	Le ho bina.
If so, it is.	Haeba ho le joalo, ho joalo.
But when you think about it, it's a very good thing.	Empa ha u nahana ka eona, ke ntho e ntle haholo.
They want what we want.	Ba batla seo re se batlang.
I wanted it.	Ke ne ke o batla.
I'm not talking about emotions here.	Ha ke bue ka maikutlo mona.
He still loved her.	O ne a ntse a mo rata.
If you expect bad things, you will have bad things.	Haeba u lebeletse lintho tse mpe, u tla ba le lintho tse mpe.
One time it was moving very fast.	Nako e le 'ngoe e ne e tsamaea kapele haholo.
They had done it.	Ba ne ba e entse.
I did the same at home.	Ke ile ka etsa se tšoanang ho ea hae.
It still looks good.	E ntse e shebahala hantle.
The man was in your bedroom.	Monna o ne a le ka kamoreng ea hau ea ho robala.
No one else.	Ha ho motho e mong ka.
We cried when we heard the sad news.	Re ile ra lla ha re utloa litaba tse bohloko.
I just call to look at you.	Ke letsa feela ho u sheba.
He agreed to take advantage of every opportunity.	O ne a lumela ho sebelisa monyetla o mong le o mong.
What happens, happens.	Ho etsahalang, ho etsahala.
Everyone has a car.	Motho e mong le e mong o na le koloi.
I have found that to be true.	Ke fumane hore ho joalo haholo.
New car.	Koloi e ncha.
It was very difficult.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo.
He probably did not know anything.	Mohlomong o ne a sa tsebe letho.
You are just as good as you are.	O hantle feela kamoo o leng kateng.
He looks human.	E bonahala e le motho.
I love her little by little.	Ke mo rata hanyane le hanyane.
Everyone thought he would never come back.	E mong le e mong o ne a nahana hore a ke ke a hlola a khutla.
Then it can be anyone.	Joale e ka ba mang kapa mang.
We'll see what happens to me.	Re tla bona hore na ho tla etsahala'ng ka 'na.
This was not the way.	Ena e ne e se tsela.
I'm learning about him.	Ke ntse ke ithuta ka eena.
Nothing like that will ever happen to you again.	Ha ho ntho e kang eo e tla hlola e etsahala ho uena hape.
But wait a minute.	Empa ema hanyane.
I do not know how to reach that point.	Ha ke tsebe ho fihlela seo.
But we have nothing else.	Empa ha re na letho le leng.
I didn't like to see it there.	Ke ne ke sa rate ho e bona moo.
We looked happy.	Re ne re shebahala re thabile.
We had just started looking for you.	Re ne re sa tsoa qala ho u batla.
Who will take care of our children?	Ke mang ea tla hlokomela bana ba rona?
They spend their lives like their parents.	Ba qeta bophelo ba bona joaloka batsoali ba bona.
But he did his job.	Empa o ile a etsa mosebetsi oa hae.
He said it was good.	A re e ntle.
Yes, that is what he would do.	Ee, ke eona ntho eo a neng a tla e etsa.
Yet he drinks.	Leha ho le joalo oa noa.
I already had my time.	Ke ne ke se ke e-na le nako ea ka.
Once you find it, you will never give up on it.	Hang ha u e fumana, ha ho mohla u tla e tlohela.
Of course it passed.	Ehlile e ile ea feta.
That should be a legal issue.	Taba eo e lokela ho ba taba ea molao.
So they tell me.	Kahoo baa mpolella.
But you can't do that.	Empa u ke ke ua etsa joalo.
But after all it does not matter.	Empa ka mor'a tsohle ha ho na taba.
He stopped and looked.	A ema mme a sheba.
I played it with my head.	Ke ile ka e bapala ka hlooho ea ka.
He picked up the phone.	A nka mohala.
He had to do something.	O ne a lokela ho etsa ho hong.
But he did.	Empa o ile a etsa joalo.
You have to stay.	U tlameha ho lula.
We will find them.	Re tla ba fumana.
And he didn't know he knew.	Mme o ne a sa tsebe hore o a tseba.
Our lives are far more important.	Bophelo ba rōna ke ba bohlokoa ho feta moo.
There has never been water.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha eba le metsi.
All very good.	Kaofela e ntle haholo.
Good job!	Mosebetsi o motle!
You cannot do this every week.	U ke ke ua etsa sena beke e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
But he would not say that.	Empa o ne a ka se bue joalo.
And that's the work we're doing right now.	Mme ke mosebetsi oo re o etsang hona jwale.
Many people used it.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba e sebelisa.
Because that's what he's going to do.	Hobane ke seo a tla se etsa.
Think of our son.	Nahana ka mora oa rōna.
Now they just look stupid.	Hona joale ba shebahala ba le hlokang kelello feela.
Do not speak.	Se bue.
The phone rang as he thought.	Mohala o ile oa lla a ntse a nahana.
But it is no longer that way.	Empa ha ho sa le ka tsela eo.
They wanted to.	Ba ne ba batla .
This is their money.	Ena ke chelete ea bona.
We have what you need.	Re na le seo u se hlokang.
I really have to see.	Ka 'nete ke tlameha ho bona.
Now they are equal.	Joale baa lekana.
You live here alone.	U lula mona u le mong.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
Look, we will understand this.	Sheba, re tla utloisisa sena.
In fact, do so for three years.	Ha e le hantle, etsa joalo ka lilemo tse tharo.
It seemed very clear now.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho hlakile haholo joale.
I want to say this, though.	Ke batla ho bua sena, leha ho le joalo.
He did not tell anyone.	O ne a sa bolella motho.
No they take them in the evening after work.	Che ba li nka mantsiboea ka mor'a mosebetsi.
I do not believe.	Ha ke lumele.
It was not an easy decision.	E ne e se qeto e bonolo.
I think my clothes will look better too.	Ke nahana hore liaparo tsa ka le tsona li tla shebahala li le betere.
I have nothing, man.	Ha ke na letho, monna.
You must be very close.	O tlameha ho ba haufi haholo.
You made his life when you would live here.	U entse bophelo ba hae ha u ne u tla lula mona.
But it works very well.	Empa e sebetsa hantle haholo.
This is the last time.	Ena ke nako ea ho qetela.
It is better to assume that everyone is innocent.	Ho molemo ho nka hore bohle ha ba na molato.
However, we learned about one.	Leha ho le joalo, re ile ra ithuta ka e mong.
It was then that he asked her.	Ke ka nako eo moo a ileng a mo kopa.
He did not understand.	O ne a sa utloisise.
But this is really going backwards.	Empa sena se hlile se khutlela morao.
Saving does not seem to work.	Ho boloka ha ho bonahale ho sebetsa.
Otherwise, she was really pretty.	Ho seng joalo, o ne a hlile a le motle haholo.
He decided not to attend.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho se be teng.
Yes, it was difficult at times.	E, ho ne ho le thata ka linako tse ling.
And they seem to work just fine.	'Me li bonahala li sebetsa hantle feela.
The situation must go.	Boemo bo tlameha ho tsamaea.
Maybe he knew that you would eventually find the truth.	Mohlomong o ne a tseba hore qetellong u tla fumana ’nete.
Her children did not like her very much.	Bana ba hae ba ne ba sa mo rate hakaalo.
He never left it.	Ha A ka a e tlohela.
Just bad !.	E mpe feela!.
He can do a good job.	A ka etsa mosebetsi o motle.
I'm so glad to be here.	Ke thabile haholo ho ba mona.
And most importantly.	Le ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
Of course not.	Ha e le hantle ha ho joalo.
But first things first.	Empa lintho tsa pele pele.
What are we going to do about this?	Re tla etsa eng ka see?
Either way, we are here to help as always.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe, re mona ho thusa joalo ka kamehla.
But then he was gone.	Empa joale o ne a ile.
It is the most important.	Ke eona ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
Even now, he did not know why.	Le hona joale, o ne a sa tsebe lebaka.
It really made our day.	E hlile e entse letsatsi la rōna.
This is not a good idea.	Sena ha se mohopolo o motle.
He was the real deal.	E ne e le eena oa sebele.
It exists.	E teng.
He felt everything in a loud voice.	O ile a utloa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ka matla.
It was really hard to watch this.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le thata ho shebella sena.
He actually came to me.	Ha e le hantle o ile a fihla ho 'na.
That's wrong.	Ke phoso.
Some like to drink coffee in the morning.	Ba bang ba rata ho noa kofi hoseng.
I was like that, thinking about all these things.	Ke ne ke le joalo, re nahana ka lintho tsena tsohle.
But that would not be the case.	Empa hoo e ne e ke ke ea e-ba ’nete.
I will eat any kind at any time.	Ke tla ja mofuta ofe kapa ofe ka nako efe kapa efe.
I just left to give him a place.	Ke ile ka tloha feela ho mo fa sebaka.
That was my job as a wife and mother.	Oo e ne e le mosebetsi oa ka joaloka mosali le ’mè.
She is beautiful.	O motle.
I really think it can.	Ka sebele ke nahana hore e ka khona.
It's wrong to be here.	Ke phoso hore e be teng mona.
That's what you want.	Ke seo u se batlang.
He sees something.	O bona se seng.
That's right here.	Ho joalo mona.
Start looking there.	Qala ho sheba moo.
You never did that.	Ha ho mohla u kileng ua etsa joalo.
Which is to say, of course, they were not.	E leng hore ha e le hantle, ba ne ba se joalo.
Eventually, he had no interest in speaking at all.	Qetellong, o ne a se a sa tsotelle ho bua ho hang.
Then he thought he might call her tomorrow night.	Eaba o nahana hore a ka ’na a mo letsetsa hosane bosiu.
I drink water.	Ke noa metsi.
Yes, they spent the night together.	E, ba ile ba qeta bosiu hammoho.
She will have a baby soon.	O tla ba le ngoana haufinyane.
The coffee was delicious.	Kofi e ne e le monate.
I need a little.	Ke hloka hanyane.
Now is your time to do it.	Hona joale ke nako ea hau ea ho e etsa.
Perhaps this will continue well after all.	Mohlomong sena se tla tsoela pele hantle ka mor'a tsohle.
I have never had a chance to go back to the room.	Ha ke so fumane monyetla oa ho khutlela kamoreng.
He will never know.	Ha ho mohla a tla tseba.
But it was too late.	Empa e ne e se e le morao haholo.
Do not understand your point.	Seke oa utloisisa taba ea hau.
Then she made us food.	Eaba o re etsetsa lijo.
I want to meet him.	Ke batla ho kopana le eena.
I can't get enough.	Ha ke khone ho fumana ho lekaneng.
This would certainly not have been easy.	Ka sebele sena se ne se ke ke sa ba bonolo.
We never found out who he was.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra fumana hore na ke mang.
Not bad, not very good.	Ha e mpe, ha e ntle haholo.
He knew it very well.	O ne a e tseba haholo.
I am very happy to have the opportunity.	Ke thabile haholo ho fumana monyetla.
Nothing important right now.	Ha ho letho le bohlokoa hona joale.
It was a lot.	E ne e le ngata.
We still feel something has to go.	Re ntse re utloa ho na le ntho e 'ngoe e lokelang ho tsamaea.
I have a lot of money.	Ke na le chelete e ngata.
I did not stay.	Ha kea ka ka lula.
His problems are eating away at him.	Mathata a hae aa mo ja.
Good news to think about.	Litaba tse monate tseo u ka li nahanang.
I knew who he was before he came to me.	Ke ne ke tseba hore na ke mang pele a fihla ho 'na.
They just didn't know what they were in.	Ba ne ba mpa ba sa tsebe hore na ba ne ba le ho eng.
Not often.	Hangata ha ho joalo.
They have exactly the same ideas.	Ba na le maikutlo a tšoanang hantle.
I have to keep it.	Ke tlameha ho e boloka.
There were still things he had to do.	Ho ne ho ntse ho e-na le lintho tseo a neng a lokela ho li etsa.
Try to use them.	Leka ho li sebelisa.
Who was the thing.	Eo e neng e le ntho.
But you know.	Empa ua tseba.
I knew they had nothing to do with me.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ha ba na letho ho nna.
I may not have been there before.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe ha ke eso be teng.
I haven't seen you in a long time.	E se e le khale ke sa u bone le.
People are starting to come home to hear it.	Batho ba qala ho khutlela hae ho e utloa.
You can read about my stay here.	U ka bala ka ho lula ha ka mona.
He did very well.	O entse hantle haholo.
He can be very good.	A ka ba hantle haholo.
I could not understand how they felt.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hore na ba ikutloa joang.
Of course, it can go either way.	Ha e le hantle, e ka tsamaea ka tsela efe kapa efe.
We talk a lot.	Re bua haholo.
It was still empty.	E ne e ntse e se na letho.
It works both.	E sebetsa ka bobeli.
When they asked why, he said he needed to eat.	Ha ba botsa lebaka, o ile a re o hloka ho ja.
Nice place.	Sebaka se setle.
And so it happened.	Mme ho ile ha etsahala jwalo.
I need my friends.	Ke hloka metsoalle ea ka.
I think he read a lot.	Ke nahana hore o ne a bala haholo.
It was not there.	Ho ne ho se na moo.
He said, forget about it.	O ile a re, lebala ka eona.
Many have the same things in common.	Ba bangata ba na le lintho tse tšoanang tse tšoanang.
Here we find everyone busy.	Mona re fumana e mong le e mong a phathahane.
So it was kind of it.	Kahoo e ne e le mofuta oa eona.
I just want to get over this and move on.	Ke batla feela ho feta taba ena ebe ke tsoela pele.
I think you will like it too.	Ke nahana hore le uena u tla e rata.
Such a place exists.	Sebaka se joalo se teng.
Alternatively.	Mokhoa o mong o betere.
He was gone.	O ne a se a le sieo.
Moreover, he needed time to think.	Ho feta moo, o ne a hloka nako ea ho nahana.
He did not have time.	O ne a sena nako.
But no one knew what to do with it.	Empa ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tseba ho etsa letho ka eona.
Not to talk to anyone like that.	Hore a seke a bua le mang kapa mang joalo.
I do not like the idea at all.	Ho hang ha ke rate mohopolo oo.
That really isn't a good idea.	Eo ehlile ha se mohopolo o motle.
I met many people at the party.	Ke ile ka kopana le batho ba bangata moketeng oo.
My mother lived another 30 years.	'Mè o ile a phela lilemo tse ling tse mashome a mararo.
It was time to leave.	E ne e le nako ea ho tsamaea.
I like to wear it.	Ke rata ho e apara.
Finally, it was time.	Qetellong, e ne e le nako.
You do not even have to talk to him.	Ha ho hlokahale le hore u bue le eena.
This is new to me.	Sena se ncha ho 'na.
Just like any of these things.	Joalo ka ho feta efe kapa efe ea lintho tsena.
Ignorance is very close.	Ho se tsebe ho haufi haholo.
He refuses to eat breakfast.	O hana ho ja lijo tsa hoseng.
To most people, that is a long way off.	Ho batho ba bangata, seo ke tsela e telele.
One of us won in the end.	E mong oa rona o ile a hlola qetellong.
You said you feel guilty.	U itse u ikutloa u le molato.
Maybe they know something.	Mohlomong ba tseba ho hong.
They are not his.	Ha se tsa hae.
I will buy a new bike.	Ke tlo reka baesekele e ncha.
Work to be the best of your kind.	Sebetsa ho ba mofuta o motle ka ho fetisisa oa hau.
There are many questions.	Ho na le lipotso tse ngata.
For some children, it may be too late.	Bakeng sa bana ba bang, e ka 'na eaba e se e le morao haholo.
But there was no time back then.	Empa ho ne ho se nako ka nako eo.
Of course, it was a very delicious dinner.	Ehlile, e ne e le lijo tsa mantsiboea tse monate haholo.
But it was not enough.	Empa e ne e sa lekana.
They wanted to be sure.	Ba ne ba batla ho ba le bonnete.
To be present for me.	Ho ba teng bakeng sa ka.
Travel is easy.	Ho tsamaea ho bonolo.
That's what everyone does here.	Ke seo bohle ba se etsang mona.
I can get things right now.	Ke khona ho fumana lintho hona joale.
That must have been fun.	E tlameha ebe seo se ne se le monate.
It left.	E ile ea tloha.
Some of them have health problems.	Ba bang ba bona ba na le mathata a bophelo.
It's a strange idea, you know.	Ke mohopolo o makatsang, o ya tseba.
However it was not an issue.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e se taba.
We've been here all our lives.	Re bile mona bophelo bohle ba rona.
It's theirs.	Ke tsa bona.
They can't understand it.	Ha ba khone ho e utloisisa.
He's only here this week.	O teng bekeng ena feela.
Group and mother come.	Sehlopha mme mme ba tla.
They will take your money.	Ba tla nka chelete ea hau.
No one told me that about you.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mpolella joalo ka uena.
It has everything you need to know.	E na le sohle seo u lokelang ho se tseba.
It is very clear to me.	Ho hlakile haholo ho nna.
You cannot doubt its authenticity.	U ke ke ua belaela ka 'nete ea eona.
But for dinner.	Empa bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
We have no time and energy.	Ha re na nako le matla.
I don't want to be that way.	ha ke batle ho ba jwalo.
To the woman he loves.	Ho mosali eo a mo ratang.
He was careful to do it right.	O ne a hlokomela ho e etsa hantle.
This is a real feeling.	Ena ke maikutlo a sebele.
, as you wish.	, kamoo u batlang.
There will be no presence if there is a problem with the presence.	Ha ho na ho ba teng haeba ho na le bothata ba ho ba teng.
Somehow, he understood.	Ka tsela e itseng, o ne a utloisisa.
We have it, and here we are.	Re na le eona, 'me re mona.
I was able to find them again willingly.	Ke ne ke khona ho li fumana hape ka ho rata.
Then he left.	Eaba oa tsamaea.
Maybe, there was something wrong with me.	Mohlomong, ho ne ho e-na le phoso ka 'na.
Often in the background.	Hangata ka morao.
It was hard for him to say it.	Ho ne ho le thata ho eena ho e bua.
Which is just right for me.	E leng hantle feela ka nna.
Everyone loved him.	Bohle ba ne ba mo rata.
They need something from you.	Ba hloka ho hong ho tsoa ho uena.
I only know the name.	Ke tseba lebitso feela.
It was not long before the police arrived on the scene.	Ha hoa ka ha feta nako e telele pele mapolesa a fihla sebakeng seo.
You need to learn to live with your pain.	U hloka ho ithuta ho phela le bohloko ba hau.
He was tired from work.	O ne a khathetse ke mosebetsi.
From the old, to the new.	Ho tloha ho tsa khale, ho ea ho tse ncha.
Now when did you do it.	Joale u entse neng.
He enjoyed going.	O ne a thabela ho tsamaea.
He saw clearly.	O ile a bona hantle.
That was his reason for being, above all others.	Leo e ne e le lebaka la hae la ho ba teng, ho feta tse ling kaofela.
Too much to ask.	E ngata haholo ho botsa.
The opinions of others are not helpful.	Maikutlo a ba bang ha a na thuso.
It was his.	E ne e le oa hae.
I have to go now, the baby is crying.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea joale, ngoana oa lla.
We did not know what to think.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na re nahane eng.
You can't sleep much tonight.	U ke ke ua robala haholo bosiung bona.
They are no longer just children.	Ha e sa le bana feela.
He was planning something.	O ne a rera ho hong.
But it is coming.	Empa e ntse e tla.
He was a strange and strange man.	E ne e le monna ea makatsang le ea makatsang.
So you can be sure that it will be there when you need it.	Kahoo, u ka tšepa hore e tla ba teng ha u e hloka.
Because now I am happy with my husband.	Hobane hona joale ke thabile le monna oa ka.
Anything you think is going to work.	Eng kapa eng eo u nahanang hore e ea sebetsa.
To us, that sounds simple.	Ho rona, seo se shebahala e le bonolo.
He is there.	O teng.
Some good stuff.	Lintho tse ling tse ntle.
A lot of things are happening during that time.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang nakong eo.
Then we tried some more, and we fixed some things up again.	Eaba re leka tse ling hape, ’me ra lokisa lintho tse ling hape.
It is his last day.	Ke letsatsi la hae la ho qetela.
Stand on your own strength now.	Ema ka matla a hao joale.
Don't say that now.	O seke wa bolela seo ha jwale.
Sometimes it hurts to watch.	Ka linako tse ling ho bohloko ho shebella.
And now it seems to be happening again.	Mme jwale ho bonahala ho etsahala hape.
He wondered if he knew what it was.	A ipotsa hore na ebe oa tseba hore na ke eng.
We had to find another way.	Re ile ra tlameha ho fumana mokhoa o mong.
This was my last chance.	Ona e ne e le monyetla oa ka oa ho qetela.
That is an adequate request.	Eo ke kopo e lekaneng.
It's for me, he thought.	Ke bakeng sa ka, a nahana.
This group has not yet met.	Sehlopha sena ha se so kopane.
I just wanted to look in the back room.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho sheba ka kamoreng e ka morao.
They have to do something about it.	Ba tlameha ho etsa ho hong ka hona.
It has never done that.	Ha e so ka e etsa joalo.
I just don’t know which way to go.	Ha ke tsebe feela hore na nka nka tsela efe.
He worked hard, but he never made much money.	O ne a sebetsa ka thata, empa ho se mohla a kileng a etsa chelete e ngata.
He did not want to look for her.	O ne a sa batle ho mo batla.
And he did a wonderful job.	Mme a etsa mosebetsi o makatsang.
And he could not just see.	Hape ha se ka bona feela.
It was the first time.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele.
Think of a way out.	Nahana ka mokhoa oa ho tsoa.
Using his real life name.	Ho sebelisa lebitso la hae la sebele la bophelo.
So he said.	Kahoo o ile a bua joalo.
I am very happy about it.	Ke thabile haholo ka hona.
He decided to take a chance.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho nka monyetla.
It would be obvious that there is no place there.	Ho ne ho tla be ho hlakile hore ha ho na sebaka moo.
He began to speak.	A qala ho bua.
My mom always tells me not to go out.	'Mè o lula a mpolella hore ke se ke ka tsoa.
We have a work to do.	Re na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa.
That night.	Bosiung boo.
That was good news.	Eo e ne e le litaba tse monate.
This may not be true of me.	Sena e ka se be 'nete ea ka.
That's when he asked for help.	Ke nakong eo a ileng a kopa thuso.
They had to do something new.	Ba ne ba tlameha ho etsa ntho e ncha.
My father made it seem easy.	Ntate o ile a etsa hore ho bonahale ho le bonolo.
I'll be done watching it before I go to bed tonight.	Ke tla be ke qetile ho e shebella pele ke robala bosiung bona.
Your feedback is very important.	Maikutlo a hau a bohlokoa haholo.
I saw my mother take care of it too.	Ke ile ka bona ’Mè le eena a e hlokomela.
Things cannot go on this way.	Lintho ha li khone ho tsoela pele ka tsela ena.
They too are looking forward to it.	Le bona ba e lebeletse.
This suggestion is always there.	Tlhahiso ena e lula e le teng.
However, do not try to do both.	Leha ho le joalo, u se ke ua leka ho li etsa ka bobeli ka nako e le 'ngoe.
He doesn't like me talking to you, you know.	Ha a rate ha ke bua le wena, o a tseba.
Once again how do you live.	Hang hape u phela joang.
I loved her so much.	Ke ne ke mo rata haholo.
There is not much we can say about it.	Ha ho na lintho tse ngata tseo re ka li buang ka eona.
We come out the other way.	Re tsoa ka tsela e 'ngoe.
But we know what we know.	Empa re tseba seo re se tsebang.
She asked him with her hands.	E ile ea mo botsa ka matsoho a hae.
We do not know what will happen.	Ha re tsebe se tla etsahala.
And it's very simple.	'Me ho bonolo haholo.
These are dangerous times.	Tsena ke linako tse kotsi.
But they have a simple.	Empa ba na le e bonolo.
He began to think better of himself.	O ile a qala ho ba le mohopolo o betere.
This still made my head spin a few hours ago.	Sena se ntse se etsa hlooho ea ka lihora tse 'maloa tse fetileng.
It will start soon.	E tla qala haufinyane.
I need them to want to hear.	Ke hloka hore ba batle ho utloa.
The only surprising thing is that it took a long time.	Ntho feela e makatsang ke hore e nkile nako e telele.
There was enough space for everything.	Ho ne ho e-na le sebaka se lekaneng bakeng sa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
It is better to make something go right.	Ho molemo ho etsa hore ntho e tsamaee hantle.
He would get this right.	O ne a tla fumana sena hantle.
This is not our opinion.	Sena ha se maikutlo a rona.
No man was happy with the decision.	Ha ho monna ea ileng a thabela qeto eo.
I still need to look at it more.	Ke ntse ke hloka ho e sheba haholoanyane.
I'm happy here so far.	Ke thabile mona ho fihlela joale.
It will be something.	E tla ba ntho e itseng.
Your picture takes mine.	Setšoantšo sa hau se nka sa ka.
But he already knew.	Empa o ne a se a ntse a tseba.
If they could go beyond that, they could win anything.	Haeba ba ne ba ka khona ho feta moo, ba ka hlola eng kapa eng.
Then he would talk about the current situation.	Joale o ne a tla bua ka boemo ba hona joale.
But it could be better.	Empa ho ka ba molemo.
I like the team.	Ke rata sehlopha.
We think it should.	Re nahana hore e lokela.
He will be here tomorrow.	O tla fihla mona hosane.
Yes, it is difficult.	E, ho boima.
I worked.	Ke ile ka sebetsa.
However, they soon learned that something was wrong.	Leha ho le joalo, kapele ba etsa qeto ea hore ho na le ho phoso.
I heard him.	Ke mo utloile.
Keep that up.	Tsoela pele ntho eo.
It's me.	Ke 'na.
I loved it then, and I still want it.	Ke ile ka e rata ka nako eo, 'me ke ntse ke e batla.
And he is not the only one you want.	'Me ha se eena feela eo u mo batlang.
None of us know the other.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea tsebang e mong.
Along the way, he met a beautiful woman.	Ha a ntse a tsamaea, o ile a kopana le mosali e motle.
That will help.	Seo se tla thusa.
The children were thrilled when their parents returned home.	Bana ba ne ba thabile ha batsoali ba bona ba khutlela hae.
We needed that.	Re ne re hloka seo.
Do not fix it.	Seke oa e lokisa.
But they do not want to wait long.	Empa ha ba batle ho ema nako e telele.
I held it gently.	Ke ile ka e tšoara ka bonolo.
The way we do it is what matters.	Tsela eo re e etsang ka eona ke eona ea bohlokoa.
Or he will do it.	Kapa o tla etsa ho eona.
I understand you.	Kea u utloisisa.
But he could have too many.	Empa o ne a ka ba le tse ngata haholo.
It was hard.	Ho ne ho le thata.
Because they are.	Hobane ba joalo.
There are only three of them.	Ho na le tse tharo feela tsa tsona.
He loves her.	O a mo rata.
All of this can be yours.	Tsena tsohle e ka ba tsa hau.
It was so.	Ho ne ho le joalo.
I loved her.	Ke ne ke mo rata.
You can always be better.	U ka lula u le betere.
His friends do not get it.	Metsoalle ea hae ha e e fumane.
He could come and go as he pleased.	O ne a ka tla le ho tsamaea kamoo a ratang kateng.
He wanted it.	O ne a e batla.
It was still there.	E ne e ntse e le teng.
You will think.	O tla nahana.
I have received a request.	Ke fumane kopo.
However, I do not know what it is.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hore na ke eng.
It can be hard to find.	Ho ka ba thata ho fumana.
You will definitely love it.	Ehlile o tla e rata.
That you.	Ea hore u.
Drink this.	Noa sena.
For my children, for anyone.	Bakeng sa bana ba ka, bakeng sa mang kapa mang.
It seems to work.	E bonahala e sebetsa.
I never said it.	Ha ke eso e bue.
You should go if you can.	U lokela ho tsamaea haeba u khona.
He loved her.	O ne a mo rata.
But we still had to figure out how.	Empa re ne re ntse re tlameha ho tseba hore na joang.
He lived there.	A dula moo.
I've been there once.	Ke bile moo hang.
I believe this was one of the first.	Ke lumela hore ena e ne e le e 'ngoe ea tsa pele.
And his life.	Le bophelo ba hae.
Because your clothes are so beautiful.	Hobane liaparo tsa hau li ntle haholo.
You will sleep for the rest of your life.	U tla robala bophelo bohle ba hau.
And the man was not anywhere in the room.	Le monna o ne a se kae kapa kae ka phaposing.
I will live, of course.	Ke tla phela, ehlile.
But we probably already know that, too.	Empa mohlomong re se re ntse re tseba seo, hape.
You had to be great.	U ne u lokela ho ba moholo.
More than any man.	Ho feta monna ofe kapa ofe.
They don't want to, right.	Ha ba batle, hantle.
Psychological danger may be imminent.	Kotsi ea kelello e ka 'na ea e-ba haufi.
It wasn't too long ago.	E ne e se khale haholo.
They know when to do things and why.	Baa tseba hore na ba etsa lintho neng le hore na ke hobane’ng.
I was thinking about this.	Ke ne ke ntse ke nahana ka sena.
They had to do what they had to do.	Ba ne ba lokela ho etsa seo ba neng ba lokela ho se etsa.
You will be staying here now.	U tlo lula mona hona joale.
I thought he was right.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o teng hantle.
There is no such thing.	Haho ntho e joalo.
So we don't do this.	Kahoo ha re etse sena.
No one could know about it.	Ho ne ho se motho ea ka tsebang ka eona.
That's a very good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle haholo.
So you did.	Kahoo u entse joalo.
I will call her.	Ke tla mo letsetsa.
Do not touch!	Se ke oa tšoara!
I really do not want to know.	Ruri ha ke batle ho tseba.
And the bad.	Le tse mpe.
Nothing, nothing.	Ha ho letho, ha ho letho.
You look good too.	Le wena o shebahala hantle.
Maybe they heard it all before.	Mohlomong ba utloile tsohle pele.
She had been helpful to him so far.	O ne a bile thuso ho eena ho fihlela joale.
I'm not sure what will happen next.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ho tla etsahala eng ka mor'a moo.
He will do nothing.	Ha a na ho etsa letho.
This is a question of legitimacy and truth.	Ena ke potso ea molao le 'nete.
It’s one of my favorite things to do.	Ke e 'ngoe ea lintho tseo ke li ratang haholo ho li etsa.
That is not true at all.	Ho hang hoo hase ’nete.
I could no longer stand.	Ke ne ke se ke sa khone ho ema.
That's very nice.	Seo se monate haholo.
I love that book.	Ke rata buka eo.
Note that and.	Hlokomela seo le.
You will come back for more.	U tla khutla bakeng sa tse ling.
I tried to get past them.	Ke ile ka leka ho feta ho bona.
Each day went on.	Letsatsi le leng le le leng e ile ea tsoela pele.
He did not speak for long.	Ha a ka a bua nako e telele.
She is shy, retiring.	O na le lihlong, mokhoa oa ho tlohela mosebetsi.
Of course your house is yours.	Ehlile ntlo ya hao ke ya hao.
I am with you.	ke na le wena.
These people want to talk to me.	Batho bana ba batla ho bua le nna.
He wanted one but thought about it.	O ne a batla e 'ngoe empa a nahana hantle ka eona.
I love his wife more.	Ke rata mosali oa hae ho feta.
This was very difficult for me.	Sena se ne se le boima haholo ho nna.
We know how it is.	Rea tseba hore na ho joang.
So they thought a lot about debt this time.	Kahoo ba ile ba nahana haholo ka molato nakong ena.
He told you exactly what to do.	O ile a u bolella hantle seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
So they are very important.	Kahoo li bohlokoa haholo.
Go girl.	Tsamaea ngoanana.
You don't care.	Ha o tsotelle.
You could not trust him, and you should not trust him.	U ne u ke ke ua mo tšepa 'me ha ua lokela ho mo tšepa.
You look like you're talking to someone.	O shebahala eka o bua le motho.
It was as if someone else had.	E ne eka ho ne ho e-na le motho e mong.
It would not be a few days.	E ne e ka se be matsatsi a 'maloa.
More than many.	Tse ling ho feta tse ngata.
I thought everything was very fun.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e monate haholo.
I didn’t think to ask him if he wanted to come.	Ke ne ke sa nahana ho mo botsa hore na o batla ho tla.
Life here seemed wonderful.	Bophelo ba mona bo ne bo bonahala bo le monate.
But it is not that difficult.	Empa ha e thata hakaalo.
They were certainly not in danger.	Ka sebele ba ne ba hlile ba se kotsing.
I put it on a bit.	Ke ile ka e apara hanyane.
Many would travel by water.	Ba bangata ba ne ba tla tsamaea ka metsi.
And it has been a very long time.	'Me e bile nako e telele haholo.
He didn't know what it was.	O ne a sa tsebe ke eng.
I really wanted to go with him.	Ke ne ke hlile ke batla ho tsamaea le eena.
You just said it could happen again.	U sa tsoa re e ka etsahala hape.
One chance, maybe.	Monyetla o le mong, mohlomong.
We talked for several hours.	Re ile ra qeta lihora tse ’maloa re ntse re bua.
I was the only one.	Ke ne ke le mong feela.
Anyone can do this.	Mang kapa mang a ka etsa sena.
We did a lot of things together.	Re ile ra etsa lintho tse ngata hammoho.
He played it very easily.	O ile a e bapala ka mokhoa o bonolo haholo.
Guess what.	Nahana feela.
Although they may be.	Leha ho ka etsahala hore ebe ba joalo.
I would love to wear this too.	Ke tla rata ho apara sena haholo.
That is what the books say.	Ke seo libuka ha li se buang.
I wanted to thank everyone for their suggestion.	Ke ne ke batla ho leboha bohle ka tlhahiso ea bona.
The same is true of all others.	Ho joalo le ho ba bang kaofela.
It will not be difficult.	Ho ke ke ha e-ba thata.
You have not found them.	Ha u so li fumane.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso.
Without it, you would not be able to drive your car.	Ntle le eona, u ne u ke ke ua khona ho khanna koloi ea hau.
This party is going well!	Mokete ona o tsamaea hantle!
You do not want any of this.	Ha o batle letho la sena.
Who he was.	E ne e le mang.
There was no room for anything else.	Ho ne ho se sebaka sa ntho leha e le efe e 'ngoe.
Tonight is a family meal night too, so that should be fun.	Bosiung bona ke bosiu ba lijo tsa lelapa hape, kahoo seo se lokela ho ba monate.
I can see someone walking behind me.	Ke bona motho a tsamaea ka morao.
We have to do the work.	Re tlameha ho etsa mosebetsi.
It's easy for him.	Ho bonolo ho eena.
Stand with your mother.	Ema le mme wa hao.
The day went on.	Letsatsi le ile la tsoela pele.
However, not all of them are.	Leha ho le joalo, hase bohle ba joalo.
But they will not be there.	Empa ba ke ke ba ba teng.
He did not know why he could do such a thing.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ka etsa ntho e joalo.
I no longer know.	Ha ke sa tseba.
I'm sure there is more.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ho na le ho feta.
They can both go.	Ka bobeli ba ka tsamaea.
He kept calling and coming.	A nna a letsa mme a tla.
It was no good.	Ho ne ho se molemo.
It was a beautiful picture.	E ne e le setšoantšo se setle.
But none of this helped.	Empa ha ho letho la sena le ileng la thusa.
I've seen something like this before.	Ke bone ntho e kang ena pele.
It was morning.	E ne e le hoseng.
My name is no longer my name.	Lebitso la ka ha e sa le lebitso la ka.
He won easily.	O ile a hlola ha bonolo.
Get here as soon as you can!	Fihla mona kapele kamoo u ka khonang!
Only a legal document.	Lengolo feela la molao.
It will take too long.	Ho tla nka nako e ngata haholo.
Such people should not be present.	Batho ba joalo ha baa lokela ho ba teng.
Simple but very powerful.	E bonolo empa e le matla haholo.
Then he was there.	Joale o ne a le teng.
He gave her the book.	O ile a mo fa buka eo.
Or they work together to create the perfect image.	Kapa ba sebetsa hammoho ho etsa setšoantšo se setle ka ho fetisisa.
I understand why you can't.	Kea utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha u sa khone.
All you need to do is give them an outlet.	Seo u hlokang ho se etsa feela ke ho hlokomela.
Unless they are.	Ntle le hore ha ba joalo.
Then he can do as he pleases.	Joale a ka etsa hantle kamoo a ratang kateng.
I have to think we will win this thing.	Ke tlameha ho nahana hore re tla hlola ntho ena.
He did not know what to say.	O ne a sa tsebe letho leo a ka le buang.
And we believe you do the same.	'Me re lumela hore le uena u etsa joalo.
We will never get back to school.	Re ke ke ra fihla morao sekolong.
I suspect he was guilty.	Ke belaela hore o ne a le molato.
Some children do not want to.	Bana ba bang ha ba batle.
Decide what is important.	Etsa qeto ea hore na ke eng ea bohlokoa.
And we can never fully understand other people.	Hape re ke ke ra utloisisa batho ba bang hantle.
I've seen you before.	Ke u bone pele.
So, it was a good thing as well as a bad thing.	Kahoo, e ne e le ntho e ntle hammoho le ntho e mpe.
It is exactly as it should be.	E hantle kamoo e lokelang ho ba kateng.
But still, he did it.	Empa leha ho le jwalo, o e entse.
Down.	Fatše.
The place has seen for years.	Sebaka se bone ka lilemo.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
My hands would be sore.	Matsoho a ka a ne a tla utloa bohloko haholo.
So it will be the first problem.	Kahoo e tla ba bothata ba pele.
They want to hear you.	Ba batla ho u utloa.
We do fun things.	Re etsa lintho tse monate.
They will expect this from me.	Ba tla lebella sena ho nna.
It really doesn't matter.	Ehlile ha ho na taba.
He looked at someone nearby	O ile a sheba motho ea haufi
I thought I was just a girl.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke ngoanana feela.
He began to tell the truth.	O ile a qala ho bua ’nete.
He was there today.	O ne a le teng kajeno.
Here it is.	Ke hona mona.
Don't think about it.	U se ke ua nahana ka eona.
He did not drink.	Ha aa ka a noa.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Sena ha se ntho e mpe.
She looks like she's been crying.	O shebahala eka esale o lla.
She is a woman and a man.	Ke mosali le monna.
We will get back to you as soon as we can.	Re tla khutlela ho uena kapele kamoo re ka khonang.
He never wanted her.	O ne a eso ka a mo batla.
Surprisingly hard.	Ho thata ka tsela e makatsang.
But, at the time, it was the last thing we thought about.	Empa, ka nako eo, ke ntho ea ho qetela eo re neng re e nahana.
He once spoke.	O kile a bua.
But we have to go.	Empa re tlameha ho tsamaea.
I think this will be the best for him.	Ke nahana hore sena e tla ba se molemo ka ho fetisisa ho eena.
Now he knew why.	Joale o ne a tseba lebaka.
he thought.	a nahana.
That looked really good.	Seo se ne se shebahala hantle haholo.
Because he could have asked more questions.	Hobane a ka be a ile a botsa lipotso tse ling tse ngata.
Moreover, one cannot know whether others see anything or not.	Ho feta moo, motho a ke ke a tseba hore na ba bang ba bona letho kapa che.
I would never be that heavy again.	Ke ne nke ke ka hlola ke eba boima hakaalo.
We do not need to see it again.	Ha ho hlokahale hore re e bone hape.
It did not matter.	Ho ne ho se taba.
Do it your way.	E etse ka tsela ya hao.
He was not so sure.	O ne a sena bonnete hakaalo.
How much money do you have?	U na le chelete e kae?
But then he made things even more fun.	Empa joale o ile a etsa hore lintho li be monate haholoanyane.
When he came in he did not look at her.	Ha a kena ha a ka a mo sheba.
She has a son now.	O na le mora hona joale.
I want it all, please.	Ke e batla kaofela ka kopo.
I have to go.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
Someone has to take one.	Motho e mong o lokela ho nka mong.
As long as it does not cost us a lot of money.	Ha feela e sa re je chelete e ngata.
I was trying to get here.	Ke ne ke leka ho fihla mona.
In the past the child lived.	Nakong e fetileng ho ne ho lula ngoana.
My first point is that no one does it.	Taba ea ka ea ho qala ke hore ha ho motho ea e etsang.
So let them have it.	Kahoo e re ba be le eona.
They are no longer children.	Ha e sa le bana.
It may be too high.	E ka 'na ea e-ba e phahameng haholo.
That was probably good.	Seo mohlomong se neng se le molemo.
No, he had to tell the truth.	Che, o ne a tlameha ho bua ’nete.
It has been difficult to earn money this year.	Ho bile thata ho fumana chelete selemong sena.
They always say they are innocent.	Kamehla ba re ha ba na molato.
However, we will do our best.	Leha ho le joalo, re tla etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
They seemed to be looking forward to seeing us.	Ho ne ho bonahala ba lebeletse ho re bona.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
But he had nothing to do.	Empa o ne a se na seo a ka se etsang.
He said he would come tomorrow.	O itse o tla tla hosane.
I loved everything about it.	Ke ne ke rata ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ka eona.
This is very important.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo.
I have never seen them.	Ha ke so ba bone.
Some believe that they are both important.	Ba bang ba lumela hore ka bobeli li bohlokoa.
He looked, and he looked.	O ile a sheba, mme a sheba.
We wonder if they will ever leave.	Rea ipotsa hore na ba tla ke ba tsamaee.
It's an idea.	Ke maikutlo.
He said he understood.	O ile a re oa utloisisa.
Still, it was good.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le molemo.
Maybe we will do that in the future.	Mohlomong re tla etsa joalo nakong e tlang.
There must be a chance for them not to get it.	Ho tlameha ho ba le monyetla oa hore ba se ke ba e fumana.
It is hard work, but it takes time.	Ke mosebetsi o boima, empa o hloka nako.
They wanted to know if she had a boyfriend.	Ba ne ba batla ho tseba hore na o na le mohlankana.
But she would not leave her father.	Empa o ne a ke ke a tlohela ntate oa hae.
I can go to bed tomorrow, but that won't help much.	Nka robala hosane, empa hoo ho ke ke ha thusa hakaalo.
He did this and people love it.	O entse ntho ena mme batho ba e rata.
We are talking to the first one.	Re bua le ea pele.
This was a strange thing.	Sena e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
We will not leave him.	Re ke ke ra mo tlohela.
You can enter as many times as you like.	O ka kena hangata kamoo o ratang.
I did not go.	Ha kea ea.
I would not do that to them.	Ke ne nke ke ka ba etsa joalo.
And as a result, it does nothing.	'Me ka lebaka leo, ha e etse letho hantle.
He saw things that no one else should do.	O ne a bona lintho tseo ho seng motho ea lokelang ho li etsa.
I asked him what he liked.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na o rata eng.
To my son.	Ho mora ka.
It was just right.	E ne e lekana hantle.
You know who he is.	Ua tseba hore na ke mang.
Moreover, you now feel that it is indeed true.	Ho feta moo, hona joale u ikutloa hore ka sebele ke ’nete.
It just means a lot.	E bolela haholo feela.
Instead, he liked that type.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a rata mofuta oo.
Do it quickly, too.	E etse kapele, hape.
I'd like to say something here.	Ke kopa ho bua se seng mona.
We had one first thing.	Re bile le ntho e le 'ngoe ea pele.
I recently started writing.	Haufinyane ke ile ka qala ho ngola.
However, I did not have time.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke se na nako.
The way we do these things is important.	Tsela eo re etsang lintho tsena ka eona e bohlokoa.
I think we will both get what we need.	Ke nahana hore bobeli re tla fumana seo re se hlokang.
It had to be several hours hard and dangerous.	E ne e lokela ho ba lihora tse 'maloa tse thata le tse kotsi.
He was doing his homework, even though it was not fun.	O ne a etsa mosebetsi oa hae oa sekolo, le hoja o ne o se monate.
You may have to buy something new.	U ka tlameha ho reka ntho e ncha.
This is what makes them the best.	Sena ke sona se etsang hore ba be molemo ka ho fetisisa.
It's all the other people here.	Ke batho bohle ba bang mona.
He did not understand anything.	O ne a sa utloisise letho.
No, there is no call.	Che, ha ho na mohala.
He does not love us when we think he has something.	Ha a re rate ha re nahana hore o na le ntho e itseng.
People do that.	Batho ba etsa joalo.
Fear of my feelings.	Ho tšaba maikutlo a ka.
Where would you like to meet?	U ka rata ho kopana hokae?
And it’s water after all.	'Me ke metsi ka mor'a tsohle.
It gives us a chance to do better.	E re fa monyetla oa ho etsa betere.
But that is a mistake.	Empa hoo ke phoso.
Go back again.	Khutlela morao hape.
I'm going to sleep now, think the girl.	Ke tla robala hona joale, ho nahana ngoanana eo.
I was glad to hear that.	Ke ile ka thabela ho utloa seo.
He was probably not my real father.	Mohlomong e ne e se ntate oa ka oa sebele.
I think that could be me.	Ke nahana hore hoo ho ka ba ka nna.
He never was.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba joalo.
He thought and planned.	A nahana mme a rera.
I needed to talk to him.	Ke ne ke hloka ho bua le eena.
The teacher was present.	Tichere e bile teng.
However, that was not their only problem.	Leha ho le joalo, boo e ne e se bothata ba bona feela.
They are stronger than they are today.	Ba matla ho feta kajeno.
It is needed now more than ever.	E hlokahala hona joale ho feta leha e le neng pele.
If you do, you will have more children, no money.	Haeba u etsa joalo, u tla ba le bana ba bangata, u se na chelete.
There is no way this can happen.	Haho tsela eo sena se ka etsahalang ka teng.
He was a good man.	E ne e le monna e motle.
We can always.	Re ka khona kamehla.
It is clear.	E hlakile.
He said he wanted to talk.	O ile a re o batla ho bua.
He did what my friends did.	O ne a etsa seo metsoalle ea ka e se etsang.
To me it is the most dangerous.	Ho 'na ke sona se leng kotsing haholo.
Help those in need.	Thusa ba hlokang.
They are the highest they have ever had.	Ke tse phahameng ka ho fetisisa tseo ba kileng ba ba le tsona.
You will see nothing strange in him.	U ke ke ua bona letho le makatsang ho eena.
I know several.	Ke tseba tse 'maloa.
But today you will find it.	Empa kajeno o tla e fumana.
His father knew.	Ntate oa hae o ne a tseba.
He can do anything.	A ka etsa eng kapa eng.
I want to stay clear.	Ke batla ho dula ke hlakile.
He was useless.	O ne a se na thuso.
It is good that not many people will know about me.	Ho molemo ha se ba bangata ba tla tseba ka nna.
Tomorrow it would come.	Hosane ho ne ho tla tla.
You have trouble reading and writing.	O na le bothata ba ho bala le ho ngola.
There was a reason for that.	Ho ne ho e-na le lebaka la seo.
High school people.	Batho ba sekolo se phahameng.
That's all one could want from a man.	Ke sohle seo motho a ka se batlang ho monna.
You can read more about it here.	U ka bala haholoanyane ka eona mona.
I know they treat us like children.	Kea tseba hore ba re tšoara joalo ka bana.
The rest is empty.	Ba bang kaofela ha ba na letho.
Of course, walking was difficult.	Ho hlakile hore ho tsamaea ka maoto ho ne ho le thata.
I will take it harder.	Ke tla nka e thata ho feta.
The place is amazing.	Sebaka ke ntho e makatsang.
he would ask.	o ne a tla botsa.
He was the one she loved the most.	E ne e le eena eo a mo ratang haholo.
They do this before they do anything.	Ba etsa joalo pele ba etsa eng kapa eng.
His father did not like him either.	Ntate oa hae le eena ha a ka a mo rata.
I don’t even think you know.	Ha ke nahane le hore oa tseba.
One woman and one house.	Mosali a le mong le ntlo e le 'ngoe.
And finally he finished speaking.	Mme qetellong a qeta ho bua.
I never told her about her past life.	Ha kea ka ka mo bolella ka bophelo ba hae ba nako e fetileng.
You don't have to do that.	Ha o a lokela ho etsa hoo.
But he was not alone.	Empa o ne a se mong.
We were very happy.	Re ne re thabile haholo.
But that’s what you love about it.	Empa ke seo u se ratang ka eona.
They have an emotional problem.	Ba na le bothata ba maikutlo.
I will ask you only one.	Ke tla u botsa e le 'ngoe feela.
That's why.	Ke ka lebaka leo.
There was just no law.	Ho ne ho se na molao feela.
See how beautiful and strong it is.	Sheba kamoo e ntle le e matla kateng.
Things could not go on like that.	Lintho li ne li ke ke tsa tsoela pele joalo.
They say we have to go.	Ba re re tlameha ho tsamaea.
Anyone can see that.	Mang kapa mang a ka bona seo.
They love children.	Ba rata bana.
They will meet theirs.	Ba tla kopana le tsa bona.
I had no idea who she really was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ha e le hantle ke mang.
They were both crying.	Bobeli ba ne ba ntse ba lla.
This is your school.	Sena ke sekolo sa hau.
Then he had none of those things.	Joale o ne a se na letho la lintho tseo.
No one said yes.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a re ho joalo.
You will not see it.	U ke ke ua e bona.
Well, almost anything.	Hantle, hoo e ka bang eng kapa eng.
I wish they didn't have it.	Ke lakatsa eka ba ka be ba se na eona.
A long time ago, all right.	Khale khale, hantle.
That's just human, but it won't do us any good.	Hoo ke motho feela, empa ho ke ke ha re thusa letho.
Writing and reading.	Ho ngola le ho bala.
Nobody here cried.	Ha ho motho mona ea ileng a lla.
We can use this to help you.	Re ka sebelisa sena ho u thusa.
Nice to meet you!	Ke thabela ho kopana le wena!
I think people will like it.	Ke nahana hore batho ba tla e rata.
He gave up and walked away from me.	O ile a tlohela 'me a tloha ho' na.
We did that thinking together.	Re ile ra etsa mokhoa oo oa ho nahana hammoho.
He just wanted to get home.	O ne a batla ho fihla hae feela.
Say so and be a man.	Bolela jwalo mme o be monna.
They are trying to understand it.	Ba leka ho e utloisisa.
He is very important.	O oa bohlokoa haholo.
I did nothing wrong.	Ha kea etsa letho le phoso.
Anything that could have happened often happened.	Ntho leha e le efe e neng e ka etsahala hangata e ne e etsahala.
Of course, they will not do that.	Ehlile, ba ke ke ba etsa hoo.
At the time, life was simple.	Ka nako eo, bophelo bo ne bo le bonolo.
Reading is a fun activity.	Ho bala ke mosebetsi o monate.
And it was very painful.	Mme ho ne ho le bohloko haholo.
They played it, but they were hurt.	Ba ile ba e bapala, empa ba ne ba utloile bohloko.
I would appreciate any help.	Ke tla thabela thuso efe kapa efe.
He realized that.	O ile a hlokomela seo.
The reason is not hard to imagine.	Lebaka ha le thata ho nahana.
In fact, they seemed to like it.	Ha e le hantle, ba ne ba bonahala ba e rata.
You can't be a doctor.	O ka se be ngaka.
They said we needed help.	Ba itse re hloka thuso.
He asked for it, but it was too late.	O ile a mo kopa, empa e ne e se e le morao haholo.
But to me it seems more than that.	Empa ho nna ho bonahala ho feta moo.
However, something else began to happen.	Leha ho le joalo, ntho e 'ngoe e ile ea qala ho etsahala.
I will not let you go.	Nke ke ka u tlohela hore u tsamaee.
Not many, it is true.	Ha se ba bangata, ke 'nete.
Obviously, that would not have happened.	Ho hlakile hore seo se ne se ke ke sa etsahala.
He would not come.	O ne a sa tlo tla.
Why no one else did it was outside of him.	Hobaneng ho ne ho se motho e mong ea entseng e ne e le ka ntle ho eena.
I wish he could be there.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka be a le teng.
Maybe it's something else.	Mohlomong ke ntho e 'ngoe hape.
We have friends.	Re na le metsoalle.
Then he began to eat it.	Joale a qala ho e ja.
We just want to be there.	Re batla feela ho ba teng.
I know how to come.	Kea tseba ho tla.
People spoke.	Batho ba ile ba bua.
.	.
We just thought about it.	Re sa tsoa e nahana.
No more questions!	Ha ho sa na lipotso!
But it was not always easy.	Empa ho ne ho se bonolo kamehla.
Someone who is always a good force.	Motho eo kamehla e leng matla a molemo.
I did not understand.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise.
Last week, last week, it was bad.	E fetileng, bekeng e fetileng, e ne e le mpe.
We were a group together.	Re ne re le sehlopha hammoho.
It just exists.	E mpa feela e le teng.
That would be a good place to start.	Seo e ka ba sebaka se setle sa ho qala.
It has always been that way.	Ho bile joalo kamehla.
Or it feels that way.	Kapa e ikutloa joalo.
So of course everyone will love it.	Kahoo ehlile bohle ba tla e rata.
There may be more.	Ho ka 'na ha e-ba le tse ling hape.
And, there will be more.	Mme, ho tla ba le ho feta.
I did not do that.	Ha kea ka ka etsa joalo.
It's fun to work with him.	Ho monate ho sebetsa le eena.
These friends were strong.	Metsoalle ena e ne e le matla.
My parents were devastated.	Batsoali ba ka ba ne ba utloile bohloko haholo.
He would not let it go.	O ne a ke ke a e tlohela.
He decided to sleep.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho robala.
We all think we can have any woman we want.	Kaofela re nahana hore re ka ba le mosali ofe kapa ofe eo re mo batlang.
And we did.	Mme re ile ra etsa jwalo.
We went out and found him.	Ra tsoa ra mo fumana.
This is the second time this has happened.	Ke lekhetlo la bobeli sena se etsahala.
What he really wanted was sleep.	Seo a neng a hlile a se batla ke ho robala.
No, it is not his night.	Che, ha se bosiu ba hae.
He wanted things to work out as they really were.	O ne a batla hore lintho li tsamaee kamoo li neng li le kateng.
There is no point in going back to work.	Ha ho na thuso ea ho khutlela mosebetsing.
We did nothing to her.	Ha rea ​​ka ra mo etsa letho.
He told her to stay in the bedroom.	O ile a re a lule ka kamoreng ea ho robala.
Any of them.	Le efe kapa efe ea tsona.
It is never too late to learn.	Ha ho mohla e leng morao haholo ho ithuta.
I did not say he could.	Ha kea ka ka re a ka khona.
I used to do that.	Ke ne ke etsa joalo.
Now let me tell you.	Joale e re ke u bolelle.
I always had something I wanted to tell him.	Ke ne ke lula ke e-na le seo ke batlang ho mo bolella sona.
It was a very strange feeling.	E ne e le maikutlo a makatsang haholo.
And my mother was talking to my father today.	Mme mme o ne a ntse a bua le ntate kajeno.
I was happy for them.	Ke ne ke ba thabetse.
Do not go from house to house.	Le se ke la ya ka ntlo le ntlo.
We need to help.	Re hloka ho thusa.
We are one.	Re ba bang.
But nothing.	Empa ha ho letho.
Here you go!.	Ke tsena!.
However, he had not lived long.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a e-s'o ka a phela nako e telele.
But that's the time.	Empa ke nako eo.
I tell you that girl is useless.	Kea u bolella ngoanana eo ha a na molemo.
Exhausted, he fell asleep.	A khathetse, o ile a robala fatše.
We didn't even have to play.	Ha rea ​​ka ra tlameha le ho bapala.
We really do something about it.	Re hlile re etsa ho hong ka eona.
That is very difficult.	Seo se thata haholo.
We still had work to do.	Re ne re ntse re e-na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa.
As a boy, he worked hard at school.	Ha e sa le moshanyana, o ne a sebetsa ka thata sekolong.
It is not just us.	Ha se rona feela.
An emotional person, whatever.	Motho ea nang le maikutlo, leha e le eng kapa eng.
It was probably nighttime without sleep.	E ka 'na eaba e ne e le bosiu ke sa robala.
He was our son.	E ne e le mora oa rōna.
Very good work.	Mosebetsi o motle ruri.
Everyone else does.	Ba bang kaofela ba etsa jwalo.
Sometimes it works well.	Ka linako tse ling e sebetsa hantle.
It was very bad that night.	Ho ne ho le mpe haholo bosiung boo.
You can forget it.	U ka e lebala.
We agreed to talk again in the morning.	Re ile ra lumela ho bua hape hoseng.
We are just friends.	Re metsoalle feela.
This is where he once lived.	Mona ke moo a kileng a lula teng.
Or, that’s how it looked.	Kapa, ​​ke kamoo e neng e shebahala kateng.
He kept opening the door.	A tsoela pele ho bula lemati.
And the longer you wait, the harder it becomes.	'Me ha u ntse u ema nako e telele ho ba thata le ho feta.
I was happy for them, and I was happy for us.	Ke ne ke ba thabetse, mme ke thabetse rona.
He actually came out.	Ka 'nete o ile a tsoa.
I can't understand this problem.	Ha ke khone ho utloisisa bothata bona.
We don't care if you give us time to fix the head.	Ha re na taba le ho u fa nako ea ho lokisa hlooho.
These were happy times.	Tsena e ne e le linako tse monate.
So there is a lot of money.	Kahoo ho na le chelete e ngata.
They must stand, or fall, together.	Ba tlameha ho ema, kapa ho oa, hammoho.
I hope you like it.	Kea tšepa le e rata.
We will not go out.	Re ke ke ra tsoa.
We moved on.	Re ile ra tsoela pele.
What were we talking about?	Re ne re bua ka eng?
He wanted, yes.	O ne a batla, e.
Tonight was a surprise for him.	Bosiung bona e bile ntho e makatsang ho eena.
Once more, he thought.	Ka lekhetlo le leng hape, o ile a nahana.
I told my wife and we sat down to see better.	Ke ile ka bolella mosali oa ka eaba re lula fatše hore re bone hantle.
This is a good thing.	Ena ke ntho e ntle.
He’s still close to problems of any kind.	O ntse a le haufi le mathata a mofuta ofe kapa ofe.
There is absolutely no problem with this.	Ho hang ha ho na bothata ka sena.
I want to be the only one who can get it.	Ke batla ho ba motho feela ea khonang ho e fumana.
I just want to catch him.	Ke batla ho mo tšoara feela.
Everyone on his feet.	E mong le e mong ka maoto a hae.
I need money fast.	Ke hloka chelete kapele.
He had one son.	O ne a e-na le mora a le mong.
Instead, there is no room for emotion.	Ho e-na le hoo, ha ho sebaka sa maikutlo.
So we went with that.	Kahoo re ile ra tsamaea le seo.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
Then stand up again.	Ebe u ema hape.
I really have no way of saying it.	Ruri ha ke na mokhoa oa ho bolela.
So that's not a problem.	Kahoo ha se bothata.
There will be.	Ho tla ba le.
I am not human.	Ha ke motho.
Time will tell.	Nako e tla bolela ka seo.
And my opinion is that it will be so.	'Me maikutlo a ka ke hore ho tla ba joalo.
I read about them.	Ke ile ka bala ka tsona.
It comes from us.	E tsoa ho rona.
We humans will learn from them over time.	Rona batho re tla ithuta ho bona ha nako e ntse e ya.
I looked from one to the other.	Ke ile ka sheba ho tloha ho e ’ngoe ho ea ho e ’ngoe.
I can't tell you to do this.	Nke ke ka o bolella ho etsa sena.
You will not hear any of those things.	U ke ke ua utloa letho la lintho tseo.
He decided to tell the truth.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho bua ’nete.
The same day it happened.	Ka lona letsatsi leo e etsahetseng ka lona.
I thought about it.	Ke ile ka nahana ka eona.
But he was the best of them all.	Empa o ne a le molemo ho feta bohle.
Maybe it's just an issue that matters to me and it doesn't really matter.	Mohlomong ke taba feela ea bohlokoa ho 'na' me ha e hlile ha e na taba.
His friends hope he is telling the truth.	Metsoalle ea hae e tšepa hore o bua ’nete.
It was not a job.	E ne e se mosebetsi.
It didn't sit well with me.	Ha ea ka ea lula hantle le 'na.
This almost works.	Sena se batla se sebetsa.
Obviously they were not going to help.	Ho hlakile hore ba ne ba sa tlo thusa.
Nor the fear of being caught.	Leha e le ho tšaba ho tšoaroa.
That was his only way.	Eo e ne e le tsela ya hae feela.
They come from money, he does not.	Li tsoa ka chelete, ha a joalo.
That's another group.	Ke sehlopha se seng seo.
He certainly would.	Ka sebele o ne a tla etsa joalo.
This was much better.	Sena se ne se le betere haholo.
Sometimes they do.	Ka linako tse ling ba etsa joalo.
It's so much fun to play.	Ho monate haholo ho bapala.
He does it when the team needs it.	O e etsa ha sehlopha se e hloka.
Mine is not.	Ea ka ha e joalo.
Then you can leave and do what you want.	Joale u ka tloha 'me ua etsa seo u se ratang.
I need to sit down.	Ke hloka ho lula fatše.
There must be a mistake.	Ho tlameha ho na le phoso.
We loved the house.	Re ne re rata ntlo.
Yet he did not try to do that.	Leha ho le joalo ha ea ka ea leka ho etsa joalo.
Sometimes that helped.	Ka linako tse ling seo se ne se thusa.
You do the same thing they did.	U etsa eona ntho eo ba e entseng.
Things could never be the same again.	Lintho li ne li ke ke tsa hlola li tsamaea kamoo li neng li le kateng.
We cannot be sure until we do.	Re ke ke ra ba le bonnete ho fihlela re etsa joalo.
It had to be alone.	E ne e lokela ho ba mong.
In fact, she told me that she wanted to meet my husband.	Ha e le hantle, o ile a mpolella hore o batla ho kopana le monna oa ka.
However, we did not find that it was so.	Leha ho le joalo, ha rea ​​fumana hore ho ne ho le joalo.
Or it would seem.	Kapa ho ne ho tla bonahala eka.
It is clear why.	Ho hlakile hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
No need to buy.	Ha ho hlokahale ho reka.
He said he was happy.	O ile a bolela hore o thabile.
He was still not sure about that.	O ne a ntse a sena bonnete ka seo.
But being a good person can be challenging.	Empa ho ba motho ea molemo e ka ba mosebetsi o boima.
I will work to find that.	Ke tla sebetsa ho fumana seo.
I didn't even know if it was a boy or a girl.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe le hore na ke moshanyana kapa ngoanana.
I was tough.	Ke ne ke le thata.
I do not understand any of it.	Ha ke utloisise letho la eona.
He was not a man anymore, but just an older child.	E ne e se monna hape, empa e le ngoana e moholo feela.
He still did not know.	O ne a ntse a sa tsebe.
And the night before.	Le bosiu pele ho moo.
And a few others.	Le ba bang ba 'maloa.
The food is delicious.	Lijo li monate.
There was no one but me who seemed to be absent for a long time.	Ho ne ho se e mong ntle ho ’na ea neng a bona eka o ne a le sieo ka nako e telele.
Everyone needs to play this game.	E mong le e mong o hloka ho bapala sena.
They happen in every group.	Li etsahala sehlopheng se seng le se seng.
You want to find out what's behind it.	U batla ho fumana se ka morao ho eona.
We use it every night before bed.	Re e sebelisa mantsiboea a mang le a mang pele re robala.
There is your day.	Ho na le letsatsi la hau.
He had seen many, very bad ones.	O ne a bone tse ngata, tse mpe haholo.
We became their team.	Re ile ra ba sehlopha sa bona.
But that is not the case now.	Empa ha se taba eo hona joale.
I was not sure what to do.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ke etse eng.
I never thought they would do it again.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore ba ka hlola ba e etsa.
Trust him.	Tšepa ka eena.
That was our fault.	Eo e ne e le phoso ea rōna.
You will start spending money on him.	U tla qala ho sebelisa chelete ho eena.
I'm just with you.	Ke na le uena feela.
We get it.	Rea e fumana.
They certainly have life.	Ka sebele li na le bophelo.
I hope they did too.	Ke tšepa hore le bona ba ile ba etsa joalo.
Too bad.	E mpe haholo.
I could not let go of it.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho e tlohela.
We will not leave.	Re ke ke ra tloha.
I'm done with all those other things.	Ke qetile ka lintho tseo tse ling kaofela.
Last place.	Sebaka sa ho qetela.
He looked at it.	A e sheba.
It's not just here.	Ha se mona feela.
I took the baby first.	Ke ile ka nka ngoana pele.
I would not do such a thing.	Nke ke ka etsa ntho e joalo.
But we have to find out what we are getting into.	Empa re tlameha ho fumana hore na re kena ho eng.
So soon they will find their way.	Kahoo haufinyane ba tla fumana tsela.
He was not sure if he understood.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na o utloisisa.
I work very well.	Ke sebetsa hantle haholo.
I mean he was my son.	Ke bolela hore e ne e le mora wa ka.
Last year it was hard to find something good.	Selemong se fetileng ho ne ho le thata ho fumana ntho e ntle.
And it felt that way.	'Me e ile ea ikutloa joalo.
It's dangerous.	Ho kotsi.
You have more.	U na le tse ling hape.
We've been here a long, long time.	Re bile mona nako e telele, nako e telele haholo.
I am sure both will be fun.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore bobeli bo tla ba monate.
You want to know more.	U batla ho tseba haholoanyane.
The truth should be that way.	'Nete e lokela ho ba joalo.
Never be with me.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua ba le 'na.
I don’t see what’s hard to understand about it.	Ha ke bone seo ho leng thata ho se utloisisa ka eona.
He drank my coffee.	O ile a noa kofi ea ka.
It was the first time I had seen Father in this way.	Ke ne ke qala ho bona Ntate ka tsela ena.
Only one way to know.	Mokhoa o le mong feela oa ho tseba.
I can go anywhere, I can do anything.	Nka ea kae kapa kae, ke etsa eng kapa eng.
Just stupid things.	Lintho tse hlokang kelello feela.
By then it would have been too late.	Ka nako eo e ne e tla be e se e le morao haholo.
But they found their way.	Empa ba fumana tsela ea bona.
We take it to be.	Re nka ho ba.
It started all at once.	E ile ea qala hape hang hang.
There seemed to be nothing wrong with it.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se letho le phoso.
I wish we were as healthy as we are.	Ke rata ha re phela hantle ka moo re nang le eona.
I don't want to live with you anymore.	Ha ke sa batla ho phela le wena.
There was no space.	Ho ne ho se na sebaka.
The law exists.	Molao o teng.
Never think of anything.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua nahana letho.
The same thing sometimes happens to us.	Hoa etsahala se tšoanang ka linako tse ling ho rōna.
You have anything.	U na le eng kapa eng.
Going forward.	Ho ea pele.
You can do nothing wrong.	O ka se etse letho le phoso.
All your friends will be there.	Metsoalle ea hau kaofela e tla ba teng.
I have never wanted you.	Ha ke eso o batle.
Very well.	Hantle haholo.
Dad picks it up and brings it.	Ntate oa e nka 'me o tla le eona.
But they do not.	Empa ha ba etse joalo.
I hope you will.	Ke tšepa o tla etsa joalo.
However, it is yours, if you want it.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ea hao, ha u e batla.
It was nothing.	E ne e se letho.
He will be coming soon.	O tla tla ho se hokae.
Because you feel it.	Hobane u ikutloa.
You can't stay there now.	U ke ke ua lula moo hona joale.
I hope you will.	Kea tšepa u tla etsa joalo.
He did not speak to them.	Ha a ka a bua le bona.
That was really fun.	Seo e ne e hlile e le monate haholo.
I am sure it is.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ho joalo.
They returned home.	Ba ile ba khutlela hae.
I think it is necessary.	Ke nahana hore hoa hlokahala.
I am not a father.	Ha ke ntate.
It was not his business.	E ne e se taba ea hae.
This is not very dangerous and you do not need a team.	Sena ha se kotsi haholo mme ha o hloke sehlopha.
This is the way one will have to get to the end.	Ena ke tsela eo motho a tla tlameha ho fihla ho eona qetellong.
Your time will come soon.	Nako ea hau e tla tla haufinyane.
You live here.	U lula mona.
No need to go overboard.	Ha ho hlokahale ho feta.
Like the last one.	Joalo ka ea ho qetela.
I can be anyone.	Nka ba mang kapa mang.
I don't see how that can happen.	Ha ke bone hore na seo se ka etsahala joang.
That's about that time.	Ke hoo e ka bang ka nako eo.
So he says.	Kahoo o re.
We will all be there.	Kaofela re tla ba teng.
He felt he could say nothing.	O ne a ikutloa hore a ka bua letho.
He spent a lot of money repairing the car.	O ile a sebelisa chelete e ngata ho lokisa koloi eo.
And that was hard enough.	Mme hoo ho ne ho le thata ho lekana.
My father was already there.	Ntate o ne a se a le teng.
After that, she sat down and began to read.	Ka mor’a moo, a lula fatše ’me a qala ho bala.
And you should.	'Me u lokela.
It's my time to try.	Ke nako ea ka ea ho leka.
And the reason may simply be that he was in danger.	Mme lebaka leo e ka ba feela hore o ne a le kotsing.
It can be very helpful for people who are already working.	E ka thusa haholo batho ba seng ba ntse ba sebetsa.
I mean, pain.	Ke bolela, bohloko.
I made friends to do it.	Ke ile ka etsa metsoalle ho e etsa.
But such a claim would be counterproductive.	Empa ho bua joalo ho ka ba kotsi.
Someone is talking.	Ho na le motho ea buang.
He studied her.	O ile a mo ithuta.
Police, man.	Mapolesa, monna.
Just my opinion.	Maikutlo a ka feela.
I took advantage of the opportunity.	Ke ile ka sebelisa monyetla oo.
We will find out all there is to know about you.	Re tla fumana tsohle tse teng ho tseba ka uena.
But, of course, they were there for him.	Empa, ha e le hantle, ba ne ba le teng bakeng sa hae.
He is good.	O molemo.
Search, search, search !.	Batla, batla, batla!.
The mind is no longer there today.	Kelello ha e sa le teng kajeno.
I'm very tired of it.	Ke khathetse haholo ke eona.
My father is no longer alive.	Ntate ha a sa phela.
But then there are other things.	Empa joale ho na le lintho tse ling.
But it is too late.	Empa e se e le morao.
You did not know that you were going to live.	O ne o sa tsebe hore o ya phela.
He was seriously injured.	O ile a tsoa kotsi e mpe.
We haven't been here so long.	Ha re eso be mona nako e telele hakaalo.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ha ho letho leo u ka le etsang ka eona.
This is another one.	Sena ke se seng.
They drank.	Ba ne ba noa.
No, they said, you do a good job.	Che, ba itse, u etsa mosebetsi o motle.
However, he did not seem to care.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho bonahala a sa tsotelle.
When nothing happened, he tried again.	Ha ho se letho le etsahalang, o ile a leka hape.
I tell people about it.	Ke bolella batho ka eona.
I went to see it.	Ke ile ho e bona.
He knows it too.	Le eena oa e tseba.
You can’t do it before or after that.	U ke ke ua e etsa pele kapa ka morao ho moo.
We did not do that.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
Only one house was an old woman.	Ntlo e le 'ngoe feela e ne e le mosali e moholo.
He refused to continue living.	O ile a hana ho tsoela pele a phela.
Then you will understand.	Joale u tla utloisisa.
But that is not the worst.	Empa seo ha se mpe ka ho fetisisa.
We hope you are too!	Re tšepa hore le uena u teng!.
Everything has to be there and then it is there.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e tlameha ho ba teng 'me joale e teng.
I can feel my feet.	Ke khona ho utloa maoto.
You will be telling me.	U tla be u mpolella.
I am sure it can be.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ho ka ba joalo.
There is no family law.	Ha ho na molao oa lelapa.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
Ask about them.	Botsa ka tsona.
The man was very big, very hard.	Monna eo o ne a le moholo haholo, a le thata haholo.
We will understand something.	Re tla utloisisa ho hong.
We have so much to talk about.	Re na le lintho tse ngata tseo re ka buang ka tsona.
I see it in him every day.	Ke e bona ho eena letsatsi le letsatsi.
I just found out that my kids work better with them in advance.	Ke sa tsoa fumana hore bana ba ka ba sebetsa betere ka tsona esale pele.
That's another one.	Ke e 'ngoe.
We asked you about the first day.	Re ile ra u botsa ka letsatsi la pele.
That's what they are, the good times and the bad times.	Ke seo ba leng sona, linako tse monate le tse mpe.
I will help you buy.	Ke tla u thusa ho reka.
Don't play with me.	O seke oa bapala 'na.
I will continue to work on this.	Ke tla tsoela pele ho sebetsa ho sena.
If not, stay there.	Haeba ho se joalo, u lule moo.
Don't you think we need this?	Na ha u nahane hore re hloka see?
I did not understand why.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng.
Better, perhaps, than his.	E betere, mohlomong, ho feta ea hae.
One day she would have her time with the man.	Ka letsatsi le leng o ne a tla ba le nako ea hae le monna eo.
A good team would have been better without me.	Sehlopha se setle se ka be se bile molemo le ntle le nna.
Nothing, as he saw it.	Ha ho letho, kamoo a neng a bona kateng.
And he had done it.	Mme o ne a e entse.
I have met that before.	Ke kopane le seo pele.
He knew now what was going to happen.	O ne a tseba jwale se tla etsahala.
But he always knew.	Empa o ne a tseba kamehla.
I have to buy it.	Ke tlameha ho e reka.
I might go play it now.	Nka 'na ka ea e bapala hona joale.
Don't say nothing now.	Le seke la bolela letho jwale.
You get the chance.	U fumana monyetla.
No one knew who made it.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tseba hore na ke mang ea e entseng.
Something we did not expect.	Ntho eo re neng re sa e lebella.
It seemed very difficult.	Ho ile ha bonahala ho le thata haholo.
Who had it.	Ke mang ea neng a e-na le eona.
Yet we learn from one another, always.	Leha ho le joalo re ithuta ho e mong, kamehla.
But there was no reason to stop.	Empa ho ne ho se lebaka la ho ema.
He did not sleep for a week.	Ha aa ka a robala beke.
He is doing it.	O ntse a e etsa.
None of them could help him.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a ka mo thusa.
I do not know how to say it.	Ha ke tsebe ho e bolela.
And that doesn't seem to be the case.	Mme ha ho bonahale eka seo se tla etsahala.
Well, whatever that thing is.	Be, eng kapa eng eo ntho eo e leng eona.
I want to say it was our time.	Ke batla ho re e ne e le nako ya rona.
He would suffer.	O ne a tla utloa bohloko.
It was really fun.	Ho bile monate ruri.
That's just the job.	Ke mosebetsi feela oo.
A little bit at a time.	Hanyane hanyane ka nako.
And Dad did just that.	Eaba Ntate o etsa joalo.
I think that's the way it should be.	Ke nahana hore ho joalo kamoo ho lokelang ho ba kateng.
Yes, we spend a lot of money.	E, re sebelisa chelete e ngata haholo.
This is great, too.	Ena ke e ntle, hape.
Do not do it.	O seke wa e etsa.
Thank you for doing all you can for me.	Kea le leboha ka ho etsa sohle seo le ka se khonang ka 'na.
So he never told us anything.	Kahoo, ha ho mohla a kileng a re bolella letho.
When you really have time.	Ha o na le nako ehlile.
I did not believe it was dangerous.	Ke ne ke sa lumele hore ke kotsi.
We work at risk.	Re sebetsa kotsing.
This is a wonderful book.	Ena ke buka e monate.
I even want it.	Ke bile ke e lakatsa.
My wife did everything.	Mosali oa ka o entse ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
That's the way this was, too.	Ke kamoo sena se neng se le kateng, hape.
I called my husband.	Ke ile ka letsetsa monna oa ka.
But it is something.	Empa ke ntho e itseng.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
I realize you are reading.	Kea hlokomela hore ua bala.
The man, who was absent, returned home at night.	Monna, ea neng a le sieo, o ile a khutlela hae bosiu.
We were there.	Re ne re le teng.
But it should.	Empa e lokela.
I'm tired of being alone.	Ke khathetse ke ho ba mong feela.
Just make it go.	Etsa feela hore e tsamaee.
Any head.	Hlooho efe kapa efe.
He was in school at the time.	O ne a le sekolong ka nako eo.
It looks like you, thank you.	E shebahala joalo ka uena, kea leboha.
And to save that time.	Le ho boloka nako eo.
Yes, that was strange.	Ee, eo e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
It's simple.	E bonolo.
I was such a girl.	Ke ne ke le ngoanana ea joalo.
They are the kids who want to be the worst.	Ke bona bana ba batlang ho ba ntho e mpe haholo.
I hope they will come soon.	Ke tšepa hore li tla fihla haufinyane.
When they use it.	Ha ba e sebelisa.
He has a family.	O na le lelapa.
She was so beautiful.	O ne a le motle haholo.
I don't want any of that.	Ha ke batle letho la seo.
I like to beg and play.	Ke rata ho kopa le ho bapala.
This should not happen.	Sena ha sea lokela ho etsahala.
He has been invisible for a long time.	E se e le khale a sa bonahale.
He says it's better not to.	A re ho betere ha ho joalo.
he asked.	a botsa.
You will probably cry.	Mohlomong u tla lla.
We cannot live without food.	Re ke ke ra phela ntle le lijo.
I don't think you want to get into this.	Ha ke nahane hore u batla ho kena ho ena.
Things seemed to be going well in the end.	Lintho li ile tsa bonahala li tsamaea hantle qetellong.
Not so !.	Ha ho joalo!.
There is truth in that.	Ho na le 'nete ho seo.
It often seems hard to believe that it has been so long.	Hangata ho bonahala ho le thata ho lumela hore e se e le nako e telele hakaalo.
Such a situation would never happen.	Boemo bo joalo bo ke ke ba etsahala le ka mohla.
But they did it very well.	Empa ba ile ba e etsa hantle haholo.
Who was he? 	E ne e le mang?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
It happens every day.	E etsahala letsatsi le letsatsi.
This is what makes everything fun.	Sena ke sona se etsang hore ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e be monate.
I made sure.	Ke entse bonnete ba hore.
It was one of those moody times where he would break into endless soliloquy with himself.	E ne e le e 'ngoe ea lintho tse mpe tse etsahalang.
Of course, it should be good.	Ha e le hantle, e lokela ho ba molemo.
That would not happen today, he told me.	Seo se ne se ke ke sa etsahala kajeno, o ile a mpolella.
Something made you want to learn to play it.	Ho na le ntho e ileng ea etsa hore u batle ho ithuta ho e bapala.
Take a good look at that thing.	Sheba ntho eo hantle.
Where are you.	U hokae.
Obviously they love it.	Ho hlakile hore ba e rata.
It's too old.	Ke khale haholo.
Everyone is waiting for you	Bohle ba o lebeletse
I don’t think one should do that.	Ha ke nahane hore motho o lokela ho etsa joalo.
Without it, you can't say you can't win.	Ha u se na eona, u ke ke ua re u ke ke ua hlola.
It should always be that way.	E lokela ho dula e le jwalo.
Just the real thing.	Ntho ea sebele feela.
I don't care about my health.	Ha ke tsotelle bophelo ba ka.
Leave a comment for the kids.	Tlohela mohopolo bakeng sa bana.
But they should not know that.	Empa ha baa lokela ho tseba seo.
This has been mine.	Ena e bile ea ka.
You must have had a difficult week.	E tlameha ebe o bile le beke e boima.
Maybe it's her husband.	Mohlomong ke monna oa hae.
He would have to make a decision.	O ne a tla lokela ho etsa qeto .
This was a lot of fun to do.	Sena se ne se le monate haholo ho se etsa.
She was even more beautiful nearby.	O ne a le motle le ho feta haufi.
He is a family man.	O monna wa lelapa.
We can do the same here.	Re ka etsa joalo le mona.
So let's talk about you.	Kahoo a re bue ka uena.
They both heard but did not speak.	Ka bobeli ba ile ba utloa empa ha baa ka ba bua.
This is not about me.	Sena ha se bue ka nna.
I did not want to see her suffer.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho mo bona a utloile bohloko.
I had to study hard.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho ithuta ka thata.
After that we do not know what happened to him.	Ka mor’a moo ha re tsebe hore na ho ile ha etsahala’ng ka eena.
This happens to everyone.	Sena se etsahala ho bohle.
Of course there was.	Ehlile ho ne ho le teng.
And, of course, how to make money.	'Me, ha e le hantle, mokhoa oa ho fumana chelete.
I do not need.	ha ke hloke.
We can't do it.	Ha re khone ho etsa.
Strong.	Ea matla.
I soon found out why.	Kapele ke ile ka fumana lebaka.
Except that sometimes.	Ntle le hore ka nako e 'ngoe.
Of course we do not know which is more dangerous.	Ha e le hantle ha re tsebe hore na ke efe e kotsi ho feta eo.
He refused to talk to me.	O ile a hana ho bua le 'na.
And they got it.	Mme ba e fumana.
I love power.	Ke rata matla.
This is very important for a woman.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo ho mosali.
You can do that here.	O ka etsa seo mona.
He knows this could be our last night together.	O a tseba hore bona e ka ba bosiu ba rona ba ho qetela re le hammoho.
He told them that he did not know such things.	O ile a ba bolella hore ha a tsebe lintho tse joalo.
Who will you meet tonight?	O tla kopana le mang bosiung bona?
After so many years, not thinking about it.	Ka mor'a lilemo tse ngata hakana, ho se nahane ka eona.
I will never do that to my child again.	Ha ke sa tla etsa joalo ho ngoana oa ka.
The house was empty.	Ntlo e ne e se na letho.
Not so bad.	E seng mpe hakaalo.
And that's what you have to do.	Mme ke seo o lokelang ho se etsa.
I thought it would be fun to watch.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho ka ba monate ho shebella.
In fact, it is what you think is most important.	Ha e le hantle, ke seo u nahanang hore se bohlokoa feela.
They are very effective.	Li sebetsa haholo.
She never told her parents.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bolella batsoali ba hae.
Within a few years, we would be gone.	Ka lilemo tse seng kae re ne re tla be re se re le sieo.
Your hair is beautiful!	Moriri oa hau o motle!
Not everyone has those things.	Hase bohle ba nang le lintho tseo.
No one really knows what happened.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle hore na ho ile ha etsahala eng.
You just have to provide space.	U tlameha feela ho fana ka sebaka.
I trust him with my life.	Ke mo tšepa ka bophelo ba ka.
I did not realize.	Ha kea ka ka hlokomela.
But we could not speak, we both knew that well.	Empa re ne re sa khone ho bua, ka bobeli re ne re tseba seo hantle.
He was expecting this.	O ne a lebeletse sena.
People often think that way.	Hangata batho ba e nahana ka tsela eo.
I mean we may not be able to pay you in cash.	Ke bolela hore re ka 'na ra sitoa ho u lefa ka chelete.
I really doubt he will be back, but who knows.	Ke belaela haholo hore o tla khutla, empa ke mang ea tsebang.
She should cry.	O lokela ho lla.
Because he was waiting for something.	Hobane o ne a emetse ho hong.
When are we leaving? 	Re tsamaea neng?
he asked.	a botsa.
After this, it was going to go back.	Ka mor'a sena, ho ne ho se ho khutlela morao.
Probably nothing.	Mohlomong ha se letho.
I will not enjoy you tonight.	Nke ke ka o thabela bosiung bona.
I could not.	Ha kea khona.
Or you were used to it, though.	Kapa u ne u tloaetse, leha ho le joalo.
He did not know.	O ne a sa tsebe.
I should be able to do that.	Ke lokela ho khona ho etsa joalo.
I want to see my husband.	Ke batla ho bona monna oa ka.
We will come with them stronger than ever.	Re tla tla ka tsona re le matla ho feta pele.
I was just happy to be friends.	Ke ne ke thabela feela hore ebe re metsoalle.
How old was it.	E ne e le khale hakae.
That is what he wanted.	Ke seo a neng a se batla.
Then you will go.	Joale u tla tsamaea.
Well, not anymore.	Hantle, ha ho sa le joalo.
The question now is whether it is dangerous or not.	Potso joale ke hore na ho kotsi kapa che.
It was just the truth for him.	E ne e mpa e le 'nete feela ho eena.
Both are important to learn.	Ka bobeli ke tsa bohlokoa ho ithuta.
We will only use energy when power is needed.	Re tla sebelisa matla feela ha ho hlokahala matla.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
He is a good man.	Motho o motle.
But then their real problems began.	Empa joale mathata a bona a sebele a ile a qala.
The children were treated the same.	Bana ba ile ba tšoaroa ka tsela e tšoanang.
They stayed until we started.	Ba ile ba lula ho fihlela re qala.
I just didn’t know enough to try something like that.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ho lekana ho leka ntho e kang eo.
I was busy.	Ke ne ke phathahane.
Everyone does that.	Motho e mong le e mong o etsa joalo.
Then we'll see.	Joale re tla bona.
The party is tomorrow.	Mokete ke hosane.
How do you know what a dog will do.	U tseba joang hore ntja e tla etsa joang.
He knows and yet he does not know.	O a tseba mme leha ho le jwalo ha a tsebe.
I felt very strong.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke le matla haholo.
This is my last chance, my boy.	Ona ke monyetla oa ho qetela, moshanyana oa ka.
That is where we will meet him.	Ke hona moo re tla kopana le eena.
Of course, it is never in time.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho mohla e leng ka nako.
But he kept his head down.	Empa a boloka hlooho.
He wasn't that way at all.	O ne a se ka tsela eo ho hang.
Swimming is easier than swimming.	Ho sesa ho bonolo ho feta ho sesa.
True.	'Nete.
I am happy to pay.	Ke thabela ho lefa.
I have many.	ke na le tse ngata.
I knew them.	Ke ne ke ba tseba.
Of course you know.	Ehlile oa tseba.
I do not know.	Ha ke tsebe.
I would not have done this otherwise.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa sena ho seng joalo.
I think he is happy.	Ke nahana hore o thabile.
I never heard him talk about anyone.	Ha kea ka ka utloa a bua ka mang kapa mang.
It would be close.	E ne e tla ba haufi.
He talked to me.	O ne a bua le nna.
Whether that is true is another matter.	Hore na ke ’nete ke taba e ’ngoe.
From there, they do their job.	Ho tloha moo, ba etsa mosebetsi oa bona.
He could not take advantage of that situation.	O ne a ke ke a nka monyetla ka boemo boo.
His job was hard.	Mosebetsi oa hae o ne o le boima.
He found a boy to talk to.	O ile a fumana moshanyana ea neng a tla bua ka eona.
They arrived too late to attend.	Ba ile ba fihla e se e le morao haholo hore ba ka ba teng.
They have power and police, but only for a long time.	Ba na le matla le mapolesa, empa ka nako e telele feela.
And so it is with the high school.	'Me ho joalo le sekolong se phahameng.
We see you.	Rea u bona.
I didn't want to try again.	Ke ne ke se ke sa batle ho leka hape.
If he doesn't know, he won't know.	Haeba a sa tsebe, a ke ke a tseba.
Visit here.	Etela mona.
That is not breakfast.	Seo ha se lijo tsa hoseng.
I'm working tonight.	Ke sebetsa bosiung bona.
You will say that it is difficult to do so.	U tla re ho thata ho etsa joalo.
I saw a doctor.	Ke bone ngaka.
I don't think he'll be back until tomorrow.	Ha ke nahane hore o tla khutla ho fihlela hosane.
That we may go.	Hore re tsamaee.
Very, very old.	Haholo, khale haholo.
We do not want this.	Ha re batle sena.
It was the worst thing he could think of.	E ne e le ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa eo a neng a ka e nahana.
For the day.	Bakeng sa letsatsi.
I like the idea of ​​meeting.	Ke rata mohopolo oa ho kopana.
I sleep and eat at his house now.	Ke robala ke ja ha hae hona joale.
I did not think so.	Ke ne ke sa nahane joalo.
She always wears the same clothes and hair.	O lula a apara liaparo le moriri o tšoanang.
So they can trust.	Kahoo ba ka tšepa.
But he had heard what was happening.	Empa o ne a utloile se neng se etsahala.
And he was great.	Mme o ne a le moholo.
Long before you leave you will have decided what to do with me.	Nako e telele pele u tsamaea u tla be u entse qeto ea hore na u etse eng ka 'na.
No one was writing it.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a e ngola.
They seemed to know everyone.	Ba ne ba bonahala ba tseba bohle.
And there was no point in looking for him.	'Me ho ne ho se na thuso ea ho mo batla.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Mohlomong ke lona lebaka le etsang hore ho be thata hakana.
Do you just do them.	Na u li etsa feela.
It was great to have a car again.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba le koloi hape.
This method makes it easy to use again.	Mokhoa ona o etsa hore ho be bonolo ho sebelisa hape.
It happens often.	Ho etsahala hangata.
She did not think it would be possible to see her again.	O ne a sa nahane hore na ho tla ba joang ho mo bona hape.
That's the point here.	Ke eona taba mona.
Imagine if he was not with me.	Nahana hore na o ne a se na 'na.
Do not feel that way.	Se be le maikutlo a joalo.
I had no idea what I was thinking.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke nahane eng.
We are not the police.	Ha re mapolesa.
As a rule.	Joalo ka molao.
Now imagine that they lived there for many years.	Joale nahana hore ba lula moo ka lilemo tse ngata.
I can't do this.	Ha ke khone ho etsa sena.
They could have finally found him.	Ba ka be ba ile ba mo fumana qetellong.
We still do not know exactly what will happen to us.	Re ntse re sa tsebe hantle hore na ho tla etsahala eng ka rona.
It was as if he were, but perhaps not.	E ne eka o ne a le joalo, empa mohlomong ha ho joalo.
What is the name of the school?	Lebitso la sekolo ke mang?
That's the law, children.	Ke molao, bana.
He suggests the weight of the work.	O fana ka maikutlo a boima ba mosebetsi.
That is not a bad thing at all.	Seo ha se ntho e mpe ho hang.
You can finish his legs.	O ka qeta maoto a hae.
You have to do everything.	O tlameha ho etsa tsohle.
You are not my real father and you will never be.	Ha u ntate oa ka oa sebele 'me ha ho mohla u tla ba teng.
However, it is a simple matter.	Leha ho le joalo, ke taba e bonolo.
However, I do not know how it happens.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hore na ho etsahala joang.
I know how to do it.	Ke tseba ho e etsa.
I write a lot about this because people need to hear it.	Ke ngola haholo ka taba ena hobane batho ba hloka ho e utloa.
None of the children were injured.	Ha ho ngoana leha e le ofe ea ileng a tsoa kotsi.
He has always told me so much.	Esale a mpolella haholo.
So, you too will start making money.	Ka hona, le uena u tla qala ho etsa chelete.
And so it was with me.	Mme ho bile jwalo ho nna.
The decision was his.	Qeto e bile ea hae.
However, he probably does not know.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong ha a tsebe.
They said they would continue to travel.	Ba itse ba tla tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
I was just beginning to live with the children.	Ke ne ke qala ho lula le bana.
They had to win.	Ba ne ba lokela ho hlola.
I will get there in the end.	Ke tla fihla moo qetellong.
It takes everyone.	Ho nka bohle.
Of course we all want it.	Ke ’nete hore kaofela rea ​​e batla.
It was something that never happened.	E ne e le ntho e sa kang ya etsahala.
I will not go.	ha ke na ho ea.
They have a family.	Ba na le lelapa.
If it doesn’t matter, much for that.	Haeba e se na letho, haholo bakeng sa seo.
I was just starting to read it.	Ke ne ke qala ho e bala.
It is important to try to keep it.	Ho bohlokoa ho leka ho e boloka.
I don’t know how we do it.	Ha ke tsebe hore na re e etsa joang.
It was a strange picture so far.	E ne e le setšoantšo se makatsang ho fihlela joale.
You have to work with me.	O tlameha ho sebetsa le nna.
We were very sad and felt like we could cry.	Re ile ra utloa bohloko haholo ’me ra utloa eka re ka lla.
Like strong coffee.	Joalo ka kofi e matla.
Good for them.	Molemo bakeng sa bona.
They liked the way we talked.	Ba ne ba rata tsela eo re neng re bua ka eona.
I was at his house.	Ke ne ke le ha hae.
At that moment, she realized that he loved her.	Ka eona nako eo, o ile a hlokomela hore oa mo rata.
The books are very good.	Libuka li ntle haholo.
So, that will continue to happen.	Kahoo, seo se tla tsoela pele ho etsahala.
You will need it.	U tla e hloka.
And we probably wouldn’t have hurt so much.	'Me mohlomong re ne re ke ke ra utloa bohloko haholo.
They will not be what you think they are.	Ba ke ke ba ba seo u se nahanang.
You should read them.	U lokela ho li bala.
I do not believe him.	Ha ke mo lumele.
He felt that it was his.	O ne a ikutloa hore ke oa hae.
I can see no fault in it.	Ha ke bone phoso hantle.
It helps, it works for me.	E ea thusa, ea sebetsa ho nna.
And no one knows where he is.	Mme haho motho ya tsebang moo a leng teng.
I do not know how.	Ha ke tsebe hore na joang.
This group must only meet.	Sehlopha sena se tlameha ho kopana feela.
At best, obviously.	Ka tsela e molemo ka ho fetisisa, ho hlakile.
They didn't think of me at all.	Ba ne ba sa nahane ka nna ho hang.
I think you are.	Ke nahana o le teng.
I understood it.	Ke ile ka e utloisisa.
I'm in one now.	Ke ho e 'ngoe hona joale.
He called her and talked to her.	O ile a mo letsetsa ’me a bua le eena.
We told her not to think about going out.	Re ile ra mo bolella hore a se ke a nahana ka ho tsoa.
We can do both.	Re ka etsa ka bobeli.
That did not work out.	Seo ha sea ka sa e-ba molemo.
This has been very fun.	Sena se bile monate haholo.
Beware, you may fall.	Hlokomela, o ka nna wa wa.
He liked this.	O ne a rata sena.
We need more people like him.	Re hloka batho ba bangata ba tšoanang le eena.
You should try to make breakfast.	U lokela ho leka ho etsa lijo tsa hoseng.
You don't have to think anything here.	Ha ua tlameha ho nahana letho mona.
There are so many things going on with it.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang ka eona.
What you thought it was.	Seo u neng u nahana hore ke sona.
So, that's why you have to think about this.	Ka hona, ke ka lebaka leo u lokelang ho nahana ka taba ena.
I found this very useful !.	Ke fumane sena se le molemo haholo!.
They would have to repair the car.	Ba ne ba tla tlameha ho lokisa koloi.
It could have been much better.	E ka be e bile betere haholo.
That was just the first thing that happened.	Ke tsa pele feela tse etsahetseng.
We did not know more.	Re ne re sa tsebe ho feta.
It is never too late to be what you would be.	Ha ho mohla e leng morao haholo hore u ka ba seo u neng u ka ba sona.
No one can.	Ha ho motho ka.
I enjoy reading again.	Ke thabetse ho bala hape.
Besides, they are waiting for us.	Ntle ho moo, ba re lebeletse.
He did not mind being there.	O ne a se na taba ea ho ba moo.
Pain meant that he was alive, as a human being.	Bohloko bo ne bo bolela hore o ne a phela, e le motho.
From his vantage point, he could see everything that was happening.	Ha a le sebakeng se phahameng, o ne a bona ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e etsahalang.
But it is usually not so bad.	Empa hangata ha e mpe hakaalo.
It is better to forget who he was.	Ho molemo ho lebala hore na e ne e le mang.
All weird.	Tsohle tse makatsang.
They should be here in a few hours.	Ba lokela ho ba mona ka mor'a lihora tse 'maloa.
He understood what was wrong with the girl.	O ne a utloisisa hore na molato ke eng ka ngoanana eo.
Notice what they say.	Hlokomela seo ba se buang.
The question is, What happens next?	Potso ke hore na ho etsahala’ng ka mor’a moo.
It doesn't matter now.	Ha ho na taba jwale.
That may be true.	Seo e ka 'na ea e-ba 'nete.
No matter, it's a ride.	Ha ho na taba, ke ho palama.
Please take another photo of the courtyard.	Ke kopa o nke setšoantšo se seng sa lebala leo.
They would like to take it from us.	Ba ka rata ho e nka ho rona.
Keeping you and your family informed.	Ho boloka uena le ba lelapa la hau le tseba.
He doesn't talk to her much about it.	Ha a bue le eena haholo ka eona.
Do it to someone.	Etsa ho motho.
We will have to find another way.	Re tla tlameha ho fumana tsela e 'ngoe.
But you can't get into it.	Empa u ke ke ua kena ho eona.
She could not finish her breakfast.	O ne a sitoa ho qeta lijo tsa hae tsa hoseng.
And tell everyone what to do and how to do it.	'Me u bolelle motho e mong le e mong seo a lokelang ho se etsa le mokhoa oa ho se etsa.
You do not have much time.	Ha u na nako e ngata.
Danger, no problem.	Kotsi, ha ho bothata.
Why did he have to come?	Ke hobane'ng ha a ne a lokela ho tla?
Are you talking about me? 	O bua ka nna?
Besides, she did not understand what her father needed.	Ntle ho moo, o ne a sa utloisise hore na ntate oa hae o hloka eng.
He was great at it.	O ne a le moholo ho eona.
Not many, but some.	Ha se ba bangata, empa ba bang.
But you have to have a mind, a mind.	Empa o tlameha ho ba le mohopolo, mohopolo.
In fact, they are probably better off than most.	Ha e le hantle, ho ka etsahala hore ba be betere ho feta ba bangata.
The woman paid.	Mosali o ile a lefa.
We did not speak.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bua.
I do not.	Ha ke etse joalo.
He said we never considered leaving school.	O ile a re ha rea ​​ka ra nahana ho tlohela sekolo.
We love it just fine.	Re e rata hantle feela.
I did not know much about them.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hakaalo ka bona.
I did not know that.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe seo.
I am the first.	Ke ea pele.
In time, she found everything she needed to know.	Ha nako e ntse e ea, o ile a fumana tsohle tseo a neng a hloka ho li tseba.
Keep reading and you can get a few valuable ideas!	Tsoela pele ho bala 'me u ka fumana maikutlo a' maloa a bohlokoa!
Please do your best.	Ke kopa o etse seo o ka se khonang.
It gave us a wonderful idea.	E ile ea re fa maikutlo a makatsang.
This goes beyond that.	Sena se feta moo.
It certainly is here.	Ka sebele ho joalo mona.
He had no power here.	O ne a sena matla mona.
Well, let's not go.	Hantle, ha re tsamaee.
The problem of knowing everything mentally.	Bothata ba ho tseba tsohle ka kelello.
They would be important.	Ba ne ba tla ba ba bohlokoa.
Well done, team.	O entse hantle, sehlopha.
What happened may happen again.	Se etsahetseng se ka ’na sa etsahala hape.
Anyway, I'll see you next time.	Leha ho le joalo, ke tla le bona nakong e tlang.
Tell us that.	Re bolelle seo.
That's a good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle.
And we would love to live in that place.	Mme re ka thabela ho dula sebakeng seo.
They may help.	Ba ka 'na ba thusa.
You would meet together.	Le ne le tla kopana hammoho.
I'm not sure how I can handle this.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore na nka sebetsa sena joang.
We were glad to hear the news.	Re ile ra thabela ho utloa litaba tseo.
That was its name.	Leo e ne e le lebitso la eona.
However, otherwise it is still a past question.	Leha ho le joalo, ho seng joalo e ntse e le potso e fetileng.
Let's go there.	Ha re ee moo.
But what he wanted was something else.	Empa seo a neng a se batla e ne e le ntho e ’ngoe hape.
I thought he did a good job.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o entse mosebetsi o motle.
He ate it quickly.	A e ja kapele.
There would be no inheritance for his family.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha eba le lefa bakeng sa lelapa la hae.
You probably know.	Mohlomong oa tseba.
If it is difficult you can do something else.	Haeba ho le thata u ka etsa ntho e 'ngoe hape.
That man knows how to work.	Monna eo o tseba ho sebetsa.
Where we should go.	Moo re lokelang ho ea teng.
Make sure	Etsa bonnete ba hore
Besides, it is night.	Ntle ho moo, ke bosiu.
You too would have a name like his.	Le uena u ne u tla ba le lebitso le kang la hae.
It comes this way.	Ho tla ka tsela ena.
Great man.	Monna e moholo.
It's not you.	Ha se uena.
When combined it is delicious.	Ha e kopana e monate.
You can play again.	Le ka bapala hape.
I would do it.	Ke ne ke tla e etsa.
The truth is never so simple.	'Nete ha ho mohla e bonolo hakana.
Think about this problem carefully.	Nahana ka bothata bona ka hloko.
Or something like that.	Kapa ntho e kang eo.
But he knew it all.	Empa o ne a tseba tsohle.
It is difficult to retire.	Ho thata ho tlohela mosebetsi.
If there is anything, it is more difficult.	Haeba ho na le letho, ho thata ho feta.
He told you what to do.	O ile a o bolella seo o lokelang ho se etsa.
This is very good.	Sena se setle haholo.
Otherwise, he would not have believed.	Ho seng joalo, a ka be a sa ka a lumela.
That's what he has.	Ke seo a nang le sona.
Today it does three days later.	Kajeno e etsa matsatsi a mararo morao.
It is very difficult to read or understand.	Ho thata haholo ho e bala kapa ho e utloisisa.
You can only give one comment per week.	O ka fana ka maikutlo a le mong feela ka beke.
And good times.	Le linako tse monate.
How would you make our shoes ?.	U ne u ka etsa joang lieta tsa rona?.
I love this house.	Ke rata ntlo ena.
I don't care what you think.	Ha ke tsotelle seo o se nahanang.
It has been very good so far.	E bile ntle haholo ho fihlela joale.
But he certainly did.	Empa ka sebele o ile a etsa joalo.
She has no one to love her.	Ha a na motho ea mo ratang.
I heard him last night.	Ke mo utloile bosiung bo fetileng.
I really like it.	Ke e rata haholo.
Or many other things.	Kapa lintho tse ling tse ngata.
He must have been very happy that night.	E tlameha ebe o ne a thabile haholo bosiung boo.
He is a good dog.	Ke ntja e ntle.
She could not cry.	O ne a ke ke a lla.
There was no road there.	Ho ne ho se tsela hona moo.
He denied the charge.	O ile a hana molato.
The more you do this, the better you will get it.	Ha o etsa sena haholo, o tla se fumana hantle.
When do we eat?	Re ja neng?
I need it now.	Kea e hloka hona joale.
Speak softly.	O bue ka bonolo.
I looked at him.	Ka mo sheba.
He wants to talk.	O batla ho bua.
You know, things like shoes.	Ua tseba, lintho tse kang lieta.
But they seemed very powerful.	Empa li ne li bonahala li le matla haholo.
I have many.	Ke na le tse ngata.
They knew when and where to find us.	Ba ne ba tseba hore na ba ka re fumana neng, hona hokae.
He was just beginning to see the problem.	O ne a qala ho bona bothata.
Or the sun.	Kapa letsatsi.
I just finished my homework.	Ke sa tsoa qeta mosebetsi oa ka oa sekolo.
He needed time alone to think.	O ne a hloka nako a le mong hore a nahane.
Nothing would go his way.	Ha ho letho le neng le tla tsamaea ka tsela ea hae.
A good time to save.	Nako e ntle ea ho boloka.
The question is whether you are there or not.	Potso ke hore na u teng kapa che.
Really easy as it is.	Ehlile e bonolo joalo ka eona.
Now take another picture.	Joale nka setšoantšo se seng.
He was often away from home at night.	Hangata o ne a le sieo hae bosiu.
Yes, there was no way that was going to happen.	E, ho ne ho se kamoo seo se neng se tla etsahala kateng.
My head is clear again.	Hlooho ea ka e hlakile hape.
I do not have it.	Ha ke na eona.
Me too.	Le 'na.
They loved their children.	Ba ne ba rata bana ba bona.
It really was for us.	E ne e hlile e le bakeng sa rona.
I'm right about that.	Ke hantle ka seo.
Do you often get a headache?	Na hangata u tšoaroa ke hlooho?
Keep learning, my child.	Tsoela pele ho ithuta, ngoana oa ka.
We get a call.	Re fumana mohala.
Without you.	Ntle le uena.
But the work of the police did not pay off.	Empa mosebetsi oa mapolesa ha oa ka oa lefa.
I haven't got it either.	Le nna ha ke eso fumane.
I could not afford to buy a new car.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho reka koloi e ncha.
But it was not the first time.	Empa e ne e se lekhetlo la pele.
He says he has no power to decide.	O bolela hore ha a na matla a ho etsa qeto.
First, take care of yourself and your family.	Pele, hlokomela le ho hlokomela lelapa la hau.
We did not know what to do when we got there.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na re etse eng ha re fihla moo.
The man went home.	Monna eo a ya ha hae.
In and out, in and out.	Ho kena le ho tsoa, ​​ho kena le ho tsoa.
Look at our situation.	Sheba boemo ba rona.
My mother had it.	'Mè o ne a e-na le eona.
Finally, they get to where they can do their first job.	Qetellong, ba fihla moo ba ka etsang mosebetsi oa pele.
We will never forget.	Re ke ke ra lebala.
I'm looking forward to seeing you again.	Ke tla thabela ho u bona hape.
Nothing for me here.	Ha ho letho bakeng sa ka mona.
Family life has never been better for him.	Bophelo ba lelapa ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba molemo oa hae.
I found a few more.	Ke fumane tse 'maloa hape.
Nice to meet you.	Ke thabela ho u tseba.
And very unrealistic at the same time.	Le haholo e sa sebele ka nako e tšoanang.
But he did not.	Empa ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
This worked for the first time.	Sena se ile sa sebetsa ka makhetlo a pele.
I like to do that, of course.	Ke rata ho etsa joalo, ka 'nete.
They have nothing.	Ha ba na letho.
Probably just the two of them.	Mohlomong ke ka bobeli feela.
I do not want to go.	Ha ke batle ho tsamaea.
I write that.	Ke ngola seo.
I like it.	Ke 'na ea e ratang.
Life is uncertain.	Bophelo ha bo na bonnete.
You will go home soon.	U tla ea hae haufinyane.
However, this almost never happens.	Leha ho le joalo, hoo e ka bang ha ho mohla ho etsahalang.
He is leaving.	O oa tsamaea.
Besides, no one knows we are here.	Ntle ho moo, ha ho motho ea tsebang hore re teng.
I did not win the day.	Ha kea ka ka hlola letsatsi.
But you don't know it, and you can't do it.	Empa ha o e tsebe, mme o ke ke wa e etsa.
It must have been easier than ever.	E tlameha ebe ho bile bonolo ho feta.
He once told me about him.	O kile a mpolella ka eena.
I think so.	Ke nahana joalo.
You are helping her.	O ntse o mo thusa.
We come from a group.	Re tsoa sehlopheng.
But that was not a bad thing at all.	Empa hoo e ne e se ntho e mpe hakaalo.
You see.	Oa bona.
But it would be nice if he was there.	Empa ho ne ho tla ba monate haeba a ne a le teng.
This is a difficult subject.	Ena ke taba e thata.
What to consider.	Seo u lokelang ho se nahana.
He has a production for us.	O na le tlhahiso bakeng sa rona.
But this will be good.	Empa sena se tla ba molemo.
So he wept.	Kahoo o ile a lla.
We have a work to do.	Re na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa.
At one point, he did not like working.	Ka lekhetlo le leng, o ne a sa rate ho sebetsa.
He lives here.	O lula mona.
He realized that he had no problem eating more than that.	O ile a hlokomela hore o ne a se na bothata ba ho ja ho feta moo.
He would write.	O ne a tla ngola.
He told me something.	O ile a mpolella ho hong.
Eventually, one would have to decide.	Qetellong motho o ne a tla tlameha ho etsa qeto.
No one made my breakfast.	Ha ho motho ea entseng lijo tsa ka tsa hoseng.
I don't know why but I wanted to try it.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hobaneng empa ke ne ke batla ho e leka.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
But where do they go when they leave?	Empa ba ea hokae ha ba tsamaea?
We understand this area better.	Re utloisisa sebaka sena haholoanyane.
This is the real problem.	Bona ke bona bothata bo boima.
Application status.	Boemo ba kopo.
It comes back empty.	E khutla e se na letho.
And you who make space.	Le uena ea etsang sebaka.
She is very busy.	O phathahane haholo.
Do things that you think are important first.	Etsa lintho tseo u nahanang hore li bohlokoa pele.
Never use your real name on anything.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua sebelisa lebitso la hau la 'nete ho eng kapa eng.
We are healthy.	Re phela hantle.
You should too.	Le uena u lokela ho ba joalo.
Tell us what you have been eating since.	Re bolelle hore na esale u ja eng.
He does, and he certainly is.	O etsa joalo, 'me ka sebele o teng.
Nice to meet you at the end.	Ke thabetse ho kopana le uena qetellong.
However, they seem to be moving fast.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bonahala eka li tsamaea kapele.
That is what they are and will continue to be.	Ke seo ba leng sona 'me ba tla tsoela pele ho ba sona.
He never told me.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a mpolella.
I never did.	Ha ke eso e etse.
I will keep it if I am a boy.	Ke tla e boloka haeba ke moshanyana.
I continued to write.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele ho ngola.
You can't go through them.	U ke ke ua feta ho tsona.
She looked at her husband.	A sheba monna wa hae.
Sometimes emotions can be dangerous.	Ka linako tse ling maikutlo a ka ba kotsi.
The baby was beautiful.	Ngoana o ne a le motle.
And now he has done it.	Mme jwale o e entse.
You have not thought this through.	Ha o so nahane sena hantle.
The doctor asked many questions.	Ngaka e ile ea botsa lipotso tse ngata.
He too is aware of the problem.	Le eena o tseba bothata bona.
There are no other people nearby.	Ha ho na batho ba bang haufi.
Better than nothing, really.	Ho molemo ho feta letho, ka 'nete.
But perhaps that is not the case.	Empa mohlomong ha ho joalo.
Somehow you found a room.	Ka tsela e itseng u fumane kamore.
But they did not find it.	Empa ha ba ka ba e fumana.
He thought we were friends.	O ne a nahana hore re metsoalle.
I want to sleep with her.	Ke batla ho robala le eena.
They don't tell you that.	Ha ba o bolelle seo.
That has to happen.	Seo se lokela ho etsahala.
Their presence means that something will eat them up in the end.	Ho ba teng ha bona ho bolela hore ho na le ntho e tla ba ja qetellong.
He denied his guilt.	O ile a hana molato oa hae.
And work well on that.	Mme sebetsa hantle ho seo.
If he did.	Haeba a entse.
Really!	Ruri!
I will see it to the end.	Ke tla e bona ho fihlela qetellong.
He went into his room.	A kena ka phaposing ya hae.
I can try that.	Nka leka seo.
He comes here often, to talk about himself.	O tla mona hangata, ho bua ka eena.
He looks tough, he thinks.	O shebahala a le thata, a nahana.
He has a mind.	O na le kelello.
I don't care.	ha ke tsotelle.
I have never owned a house of my own.	Ha ke eso be le ntlo eo e leng ya ka.
He used to do that to her when she wanted something.	O ne a tloaetse ho mo etsetsa joalo ha a batla ho hong.
They all use solar energy.	Kaofela ha tsona li sebelisa matla a letsatsi.
Now something new is happening.	Hona joale ho etsahala ntho e ncha.
He looked at his hands.	A sheba matsoho a hae.
They just.	Ba mpa feela.
I think he doesn't care as much as he says.	Ke nahana hore ha a tsotelle joalo ka ha a bolela.
He says he can't.	O re a ke ke.
I didn’t think about it enough.	Ke ne ke sa e nahane ka ho lekaneng.
And very important.	Le ea bohlokoa haholo.
That is your reason !.	Ke lona lebaka la hau!.
In fact, your whole life should be like that.	Ha e le hantle, bophelo bohle ba hao bo lokela ho ba joalo.
It can go either way.	E ka ea ka tsela efe kapa efe.
You need to move fast.	O hloka ho tsamaea kapele.
But he heard.	Empa o ile a utloa.
Nobody there.	Haho motho moo.
I love them too, but I would love to have them both.	Le tsona ke li rata, empa ke tla thabela ho ba le tsona ka bobeli.
But it is not my fault.	Empa ha se molato oa ka.
Of course, this can happen.	Ha e le hantle, sena se ka etsahala.
It does not see the problem.	Ha se bona bothata.
I would appreciate any help.	Ke tla thabela thuso efe kapa efe.
The place here is amazingly beautiful.	Sebaka sa mona se setle ka tsela e makatsang.
There was no way for me to be sure.	Ho ne ho se mokhoa oa hore ke be le bonnete.
There is no place for you here, you should know that.	Haho sebaka sa hao ka mona, o lokela ho tseba seo.
Stop.	Ema.
You have done enough, and you must go home to them.	O entse ho lekaneng, mme o lokela ho ya hae ho bona.
Because he did not want to go to school.	Hobane o ne a sa batle ho kena sekolo.
I had no time for it.	Ke ne ke se na nako ea eona.
See how much you love her girl.	Sheba kamoo u ratang ngoanana oa hae.
I thought we were playing fun things sometimes.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re bapala lintho tse monate ka linako tse ling.
Let another be so.	E mong a ke a be joalo.
I'm just a human being.	Ke motho feela.
So we need to fix it.	Kahoo re hloka ho e lokisa.
Stop, yes, he did.	Ema, e, o ile a etsa joalo.
He has no close friends to talk to.	Ha a na metsoalle e haufi eo a ka buang ka eona.
But power alone was not enough.	Empa matla feela a ne a sa lekana.
I have the same.	Ke na le se tšoanang.
True, it happened to everyone, but still.	Ke 'nete hore e ne e etsahala ho bohle, empa leha ho le joalo.
People say things about my family.	Batho ba bua lintho ka lelapa la ka.
I'm sorry, sorry for the man he is.	Ke masoabi, masoabi lebaka la monna eo e leng eena.
However, you will not be able to do that.	Leha ho le joalo, u ke ke ua khona ho etsa joalo.
But there seemed to be something wrong.	Empa ho ne ho bonahala ho e-na le phoso.
I was with his mother.	Ke ne ke na le mme wa hae.
We will find them.	Re tla ba fumana.
Their value to us is the worst.	Bohlokoa ba bona ho rona bo mpe ka ho fetisisa.
She could give him some nice clothes.	O ne a ka mo fa liaparo tse ntle.
I had no idea he was there until after that.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore o teng ho fihlela ka mor'a taba eo.
Any idea how I can achieve that.	Mohopolo ofe kapa ofe nka fihlela seo joang.
He understood how they worked, in a way.	O ne a utloisisa hore na ba sebetsa joang, ka tsela e itseng.
You did not have to be an expert.	U ne u sa tlameha ho ba setsebi.
Fix the first route.	Lokisa tsela ea pele.
I did not meet anyone who was playing.	Ha kea ka ka kopana le mang kapa mang ea neng a ntse a bapala.
And it was amazing.	Mme e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
He will be coming home soon.	O tla fihla hae haufinyane.
It will do the same for you.	E tla u etsetsa se tšoanang.
We were happy.	Re ne re thabile.
You understand them.	Ua ba utloisisa.
Some people walk.	Batho ba bang ba tsamaea ka maoto.
They did not seem to notice us.	Ba ne ba sa bonahale ba re bone.
Believe it through us.	E lumele ka rona.
I have to do this.	Ke tlameha ho etsa sena.
And that is exactly what happened.	Mme ke sona se etsahetseng hantle.
I never thought we were so close.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore re metsoalle e haufi hakaalo.
It was very difficult.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo.
You could see that.	O ne o ka bona seo.
He reached out to me on his cell phone.	O ile a fihla ho 'na ka mohala oa hae.
Looking for someone so much, that they would not have it.	Ho batla motho haholo, hoo ba neng ba ke ke ba ba le bona.
This was supposed to be a pleasant evening.	Ena e ne e lokela ho ba mantsiboea a monate.
He would surely cry.	Ruri o ne a tla lla.
The man's children were very close.	Bana ba motho ba ne ba le haufi haholo.
You need memory.	U hloka mohopolo.
They love him very much.	Ba mo rata haholo.
I wish he would never do that again.	Ke lakatsa eka a ke ke a hlola a etsa joalo.
I don't think he really means that.	Ha ke nahane hore o hlile o bolela seo.
And you use your name.	'Me u sebelisa lebitso la hau.
It simply means that the force is working.	E bolela feela hore matla a sebetsa.
They could hear him trying.	Ba ne ba mo utloa a leka.
You do not know if they are.	Ha u tsebe hore na ba .
I've seen it here, here, and here.	Ke e bone mona, mona, le mona.
The fourth time there.	Lekhetlo la bone moo.
I do, as it happens.	Ke etsa joalo, joalo ka ha ho etsahala.
I should thank my parents for this.	Ke lokela ho leboha batsoali ba ka ka sena.
But that is not all.	Empa ha se eona feela.
He lived alone.	O ne a lula a le mong.
He did and saw nothing.	O ile a etsa mme a bona letho.
Tell us your thoughts !.	Re bolelle maikutlo a hau!.
I want to do more.	Ke batla ho etsa ho feta.
It was time to come back.	E ne e le nako ea ho khutla.
Many people loved him.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba mo rata.
It just didn’t matter.	Ho ne ho se taba feela.
No, it was not.	Che, ho ne ho se joalo.
I do not want to talk about this.	Ha ke batle ho bua ka taba ena.
And sincere thanks to you.	Le ho leboha ka 'nete ho uena.
That trust was exactly what my father needed.	Ho tšepa hoo ke sona seo Ntate a neng a se hloka.
One has more to do than the other.	E mong ha a na seo a ka se etsang ho feta e mong.
He was needed.	O ne a hlokahala.
I speak.	Kea bua.
I can't see him very well.	Ha ke mo bone hantle.
Wasn't that great.	Na e ne e se ntle.
That's not really the case.	Ho hlile ha se kamoo ho etsahalang.
It works well.	E sebetsa hantle.
Probably never.	Mohlomong ha ho mohla.
They have to be very good.	Ba lokela ho ba hantle haholo.
Writing is important, don’t you think?	Ho ngola ho bohlokoa, na ha u nahane?
And we can work with people.	Mme re ka sebetsa le batho.
Their situation was pleasant.	Boemo ba bona bo ne bo le monate.
I always have.	Ke na le kamehla.
We do not have such a situation here.	Ha re na boemo bo joalo mona.
They are very sad.	Ba utloile bohloko haholo.
I enjoy giving.	Ke thabela ho fana.
I used this technique.	Ke ile ka sebelisa mokhoa ona.
Thank you for the coffee.	Kea leboha ka kofi.
He betrayed his house.	O ile a eka ntlo ea hae.
Now we do.	Joale re etsa joalo.
I feel like some might like it while others don’t.	Ke utloa eka ba bang ba ka e rata ha ba bang ha ba e rate.
Just a waste of time.	Ho qeta nako feela.
I know you are.	Kea tseba hore u.
We work hard to do family things together.	Re sebetsa ka thata ho etsa lintho tsa lelapa hammoho.
The ceremony usually lasts three days.	Hangata mokete ona o nka matsatsi a mararo.
These take time.	Tsena li nka nako.
This is not necessary.	Ha ho hlokahale sena.
It's been a long time.	E se e le nako e telele.
She is not sure what happened to that boy.	Ha a tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahetseng ka moshanyana eo.
We would not even need a car to get to them.	Re ne re ke ke ra hloka le koloi ho fihla ho bona.
Do it for yourself in you.	E etse bakeng sa hau ho uena.
His wife and children are here.	Mosali oa hae le bana ba teng mona.
It's not too long.	Ha se nako e telele haholo.
But it was, however, fun as it progressed.	Empa e ne e le joalo, e monate ha e ntse e tsoela pele.
We only need three things to win, three things.	Re hloka feela lintho tse tharo ho hlola, lintho tse tharo.
He was not living a good life.	O ne a sa phela bophelo bo monate.
Let's see how it goes.	A re bone hore na ho tsamaea joang.
It just wasn't enough for them.	E ne e mpa e sa ba lekana.
But it is not that simple.	Empa ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
We need to know what is going on there.	Re hloka ho tseba se etsahalang moo.
Drinking is a problem.	Ho noa ke bothata.
But you did not think about it.	Empa u ne u sa nahana ka eona.
Mine.	Ea ka.
They had not said much that morning.	Ba ne ba eso bue hakaalo hoseng hoo.
I just knew it was time to move on.	Ke ne ke tseba feela hore ke nako ea ho tsoela pele.
I still feel that way.	Ke ntse ke ikutloa joalo.
This is very simple.	Sena se bonolo haholo.
I only use it every now and then.	Ke e sebelisa feela nako le nako.
Not many, as it happened.	Ha se ba bangata, joalo ka ha ho ile ha etsahala.
You do all you can to help them.	U etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang ho ba thusa.
You should not use it.	Ha ua lokela ho e sebelisa.
You could see why.	U ne u ka bona lebaka.
My head started to ache.	Hlooho ea ka e ile ea qala ho utloa bohloko.
All of you.	Kaofela ha hao.
He left and did not return.	O ile a tsamaea eaba ha aa ka a khutla.
I told them to be sure.	Ke ile ka ba bolella hore ba be le bonnete.
Don't buy it.	U se ke ua e reka.
He tried to figure out what to do.	O ile a leka ho fumana hore na a etse eng.
So he was a bit busy.	Kahoo o ne a batla a phathahane.
The walk took several hours.	Ho tsamaea ho ile ha nka lihora tse 'maloa.
It's the most fun.	E monate ka ho fetisisa.
And he would not understand.	'Me o ne a ke ke a utloisisa.
Hold on to it.	Tšoara ho eona.
So, do it in the future.	Kahoo, e etse nakong e tlang.
If so, they are good.	Haeba li joalo, li ntle.
I'm always tired, but that's not bad.	Ke lula ke khathetse, empa seo ha se mpe.
But certainly second.	Empa ka sebele ea bobeli.
I could not know anything.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho tseba letho.
We have a wonderful time.	Re na le nako e monate.
Thank you for all you have done.	Kea leboha ka tsohle tseo u li entseng.
That is very good news.	Ke litaba tse monate haholo tseo.
I got it, I got it.	Ke e fumane, ke e fumane.
And you do.	'Me u etsa joalo.
This was to be a mistake.	Sena se ne se lokela ho ba phoso.
They could hold hands.	Ba ne ba ka ba tšoara ka matsoho.
So, work hard.	Kahoo, sebetsa ka thata.
You must see this.	O tlameha ho bona sena.
He made sure.	O entse bonnete.
He is a good man.	Ke monna e motle.
There is no chance of entry.	Ha ho na monyetla oa ho kena.
No one liked him.	Ho ne ho se motho ea mo ratang.
Every time.	Nako tsohle.
That it wasn't as bad as it really was.	Hore e ne e se mpe joalo ka ha e ne e hlile e le joalo.
He is a strange man.	Ke monna ea makatsang.
It is only necessary that you do something about them.	Ho bohlokoa feela hore u ka etsa ho hong ka bona.
That's the way it was.	Ke kamoo ho neng ho le kateng.
They understood their role.	Ba ne ba utloisisa mosebetsi oa bona.
You may be wondering how long it took.	U ka ’na ua ipotsa hore na ho nkile nako e telele hakae.
He was tough.	O ne a le thata.
What happened in the past is the past.	Se etsahetseng nakong e fetileng ke nakong e fetileng.
This is exactly what it is.	Sena ke sona hantle.
It would be better.	Ho ka ba molemo.
You can know for sure.	U ka tseba hantle.
Nice to hear all your thoughts.	Ke thabela ho utloa maikutlo a hau kaofela.
I love the way it happened.	Ke rata tsela eo ho etsahetseng ka eona.
Just say you mean it.	E re feela u bolela seo.
Someone was coming.	Ho ne ho tla motho.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
You have to see it to believe it.	U tlameha ho e bona hore u e lumele.
People are beautiful, too.	Batho ba batle, le bona.
The rest were gone.	Ba bang bohle ba ne ba ile.
We have the money to make it.	Re na le chelete ea ho e etsa.
If money is not a problem,	Haeba chelete e se bothata,
You still have a chance.	O sa na le monyetla.
I did not find that to be true.	Ha kea fumana seo e le 'nete.
He left work early.	O ile a tloha mosebetsing pele ho nako.
But she still did not know how to tell him her story.	Empa o ne a ntse a sa tsebe hore na a mo bolelle litaba tsa hae joang.
We’ve all done a really good job with it.	Kaofela re entse mosebetsi o motle haholo ka eona.
However, it is a personal opinion.	Leha ho le joalo, ke maikutlo a motho.
He still thought he was guilty.	O ne a ntse a nahana hore o molato.
This is good news.	Tsena ke litaba tse monate.
Some say no.	Ba bang ba re che.
Yes, it is very important.	Ho joalo, e bohlokoa haholo.
Life was simple, simple.	Bophelo bo ne bo le bonolo, bo le bonolo.
This is difficult to understand.	Sena se thata ho se utloisisa.
As you write this you are not.	Ha u ntse u ngola sena ha u so.
But no one knew what to do with it.	Empa ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tseba hore na a etse eng ka eona.
Probably too much.	Mohlomong e lekana haholo.
Just leave people alone.	Tlohela batho feela.
That is what he needed.	Ke seo a neng a se hloka.
So, from now on we consider the last thing to be true.	Kahoo, ho tloha joale ho ea pele re nka hore taba ea ho qetela ke 'nete.
Go to it.	Ea ho e na.
I got some bad news.	Ke fumane litaba tse mpe.
I treated her very well and she did not refuse.	Ke ile ka mo tšoara hantle haholo ’me ha aa ka a hana.
He stopped.	A ema.
You have no job.	Ha u na mosebetsi.
I would like to know what you think of it.	Ke kopa ho tseba hore na u nahana eng ka eona.
Never think about it.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua nahana ka eona.
They came home tired, but happy.	Ba ile ba fihla hae ba khathetse, empa ba thabile.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
I slept.	Ke ile ka robala.
Maybe they don't meet.	Mohlomong ha li kopane.
The car did not cost much.	Koloi e ne e se na chelete e ngata.
However, that was not the most important thing.	Leha ho le joalo, eo e ne e se eona ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
And the most likely.	Mme e ka etsahalang ka ho fetisisa.
Of course, that was the first way.	Ha e le hantle, eo e ne e le tsela ea pele.
Now, the rest of us do, too.	Jwale, rona ba bang re etsa jwalo, le rona.
If a man.	Haeba monna.
No one saw it as life.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a e bona e le bophelo.
The father of the family meets with them regularly.	Ntate oa lelapa o kopana le bona ka linako tsohle.
Of course, he knew about this.	Ehlile, o ne a tseba ka sena.
He really was one of us.	Ruri e ne e le e mong wa rona.
He enjoyed being with them.	O ne a thabela ho ba le bona.
There will be a cry here soon.	Ho tla lla ka mona haufinyane.
So we found a place.	Kahoo re ile ra fumana sebaka.
I hope to see you soon.	Ke tšepa ho u bona haufinyane.
It seemed to be happening at the worst possible time.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho etsahala ka nako e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
I can fix it.	Nka e lokisa.
Sometimes life was hard.	Ka linako tse ling bophelo bo ne bo le boima haholo.
It comes first.	Ho tla pele.
That's just the certainty of it.	Ke bonnete ba eona feela.
They can buy a new car.	Ba ka reka koloi e ncha.
Of course he loved her.	Ehlile o ne a mo rata.
I think he will be able to.	Ke nahana hore o tla khona hape.
I had to be something.	Ke ne ke lokela ho ba ntho e itseng.
And that's just the way it is.	Mme ho jwalo feela.
He will look for her tomorrow.	O tla mo batla hosane.
There is not enough space.	Ha ho sebaka se lekaneng.
He will do it in the future.	O tla etsa nakong e tlang.
I didn't have to do anything that night.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale hore ke etse letho bosiung boo.
He could understand it, of course.	O ne a ka e utloisisa, ehlile.
I actually went to school.	Ka sebele ke ile ka ea sekolong.
This is not an easy task.	Sena ha se mosebetsi o bonolo.
Whatever happens.	Eng kapa eng e etsahalang.
We just knew who the other person was.	Re ne re tseba feela hore na motho e mong ke mang.
Everyone is just crying.	Batho bohle ba lla feela.
It really got to him.	Ehlile e ile ea fihla ho eena.
I heard him.	Ke mo utloile.
I think Dad was making good money at the time.	Ke nahana hore Ntate o ne a etsa chelete e ntle ka nako eo.
I like the kind of people who have bought it.	Ke rata mofuta oa batho ba kileng ba e reka.
Is the man just calling?	Na monna eo o sa tsoa letsa?
I heard him.	Ke mo utloile.
I told you that in advance.	Ke le boleletse taba eo esale pele.
We spent the night there.	Re ile ra hlola bosiu moo.
But he did not want to spend time with another woman.	Empa o ne a sa batle ho qeta nako le mosali e mong.
It was very painful.	E ne e le bohloko haholo.
I want you to think about it carefully.	Ke batla hore u li nahane ka hloko.
He would go to his room.	O ne a tla ea kamoreng ea hae.
I was a child at the time.	Ka nako eo ke ne ke le ngoana.
I said he could go.	Ke itse a ka tsamaea.
My hands were crying.	Matsoho a ka a ne a lla.
You do not have time to read.	Ha u na nako ea ho bala.
I get that now.	Ke fumana seo ha jwale.
However, you cannot believe or trust these people.	Leha ho le joalo, u ke ke ua lumela kapa ua tšepa batho bana.
We no longer know how to do many things.	Ha re sa tseba ho etsa lintho tse ngata.
His head was just.	Hlooho ya hae e ne e le feela.
I don't want to write down what he said or did.	Ha ke batle ho ngola seo a se buileng kapa seo a se entseng.
If not, it seems.	Ha ho joalo, ho bonahala.
We will do everything alone.	Re tla etsa tsohle re le bang.
Or think of the law.	Kapa nahana ka molao.
Never drink and drive!	Le ka mohla u se ke ua noa 'me ua khanna!
Now I have a strange problem with it.	Hona joale ke na le bothata bo makatsang ka eona.
Sometimes this was very difficult.	Ka linako tse ling sena se ne se le boima haholo.
She loves it.	O a e rata.
None of us expected to see an adult.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a lebeletse ho bona motho e moholo.
No, they did not.	Che ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
Indeed, they were.	Ka sebele, ba ne ba le joalo.
I do not think there is more work to be done than that.	Ha ke nahane hore ho na le mosebetsi o boima ho feta oo.
The same thing is happening today.	Hoa etsahala se tšoanang kajeno.
I really had to learn to do that.	Ruri ke ile ka tlameha ho ithuta ho etsa seo.
Either way it seemed fun.	Mofuta ofe kapa ofe o ne o bonahala o le monate.
He never told me about it.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a mpolella ka eona.
Other than that, your style looks very good.	Ntle le moo, mokhoa oa hau o shebahala o le motle haholo.
For a long time.	Bakeng sa nako e telele.
But, of course.	Empa, ha e le hantle.
Probably.	Mohlomong.
I had just finished drinking.	Ke ne ke qeta ho noa.
It really is starting to get to my husband.	Ehlile e qala ho fihla ho monna oa ka.
I hear him.	Kea mo utloa.
This is an easy task.	Ona ke mosebetsi o bonolo.
Never read about it anywhere.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua bala ka eona kae kapa kae.
However, he did not return.	Leha ho le joalo, ha aa ka a khutla.
We will do that.	Re tla etsa joalo.
Either he was absent or he was present and he was gone.	E ka 'na eaba o ne a le sieo kapa o ne a le teng 'me o ne a ile.
I knew what he liked.	Ke ne ke tseba seo a se ratang.
And anyone there could not go.	Le mang kapa mang moo o ne a sa khone ho ea.
I did not want to be like that.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho ba joalo.
Water.	Metsi a metsi.
Something wonderful happened.	Ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang.
But she was very beautiful.	Empa o ne a le motle haholo.
There it is!	Ke eo!
Why do we need him? 	Ke hobane'ng ha re mo hloka?
The other children refused.	Bana ba bang ba ne ba hana.
.	.
Of course, this is easier said than done.	Ha e le hantle, sena se bonolo ho bua ho feta ho se etsa.
They always say this to me.	Ba bua sena ho nna kamehla.
However, these are good.	Leha ho le joalo, tsena li ntle.
This is not the case.	Sena ha se sona.
Each time, this is the only time.	Nako le nako, nako ena e le 'ngoe feela.
The room is nice.	Kamore e ntle.
This is not a mistake.	Sena ha se phoso.
But, just think.	Empa, nahana feela.
One can do it back and forth.	Motho a ka e etsa pele le morao.
He told me that.	O ile a mpolella seo.
My mother wanted to know everything.	’Mè o ne a batla ho tseba ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
They'll be waiting for that.	Ba tla be ba emetse sona seo.
I did not take them.	Ha kea ka ka li nka.
I want to go further.	Ke batla ho feta moo.
You were still a boy.	U ne u sa le moshanyana.
They need money.	Ba hloka chelete.
He would soon understand it.	O ne a tla e utloisisa kapele.
If he cannot fix our problems, no one can.	Haeba a sa khone ho lokisa mathata a rona, ha ho motho ea ka khonang.
We need your help.	Re hloka thuso ea hau.
And they don't see it.	Mme ha ba e bone.
Stay for food.	Lula bakeng sa lijo.
If it takes a lot of time, make time worthwhile.	Haeba ho nka nako e ngata, etsa hore nako e be ea bohlokoa.
And they do it every day.	Mme ba e etsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
He wants us to know him.	O batla hore re mo tsebe.
Well never.	Hantle le ka mohla.
When we were both human.	Ha re ne re le batho ka bobeli.
You said we all want, even if we don't go.	U itse kaofela re batla, leha re sa tsamaee.
And we must move on.	'Me re tlameha ho tsoela pele.
But it is.	Empa ho joalo.
They came out to see us.	Ba tsoa ho tla re bona.
This is not too bad.	Sena ha se mpe haholo.
There is no ground.	Ha ho na fatše.
I do not understand why it was not so.	Ha ke utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha e ne e se joalo.
They don’t know how we do things here.	Ha ba tsebe hore na re etsa lintho joang mona.
But this is important.	Empa sena ke sa bohlokoa.
But there was no time for that.	Empa ho ne ho se nako ea seo.
I had to call.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho letsa.
He plays with his food.	O bapala ka lijo tsa hae.
We want you here.	Re u batla mona.
Talking about his problems.	Ho bua ka mathata a hae.
My husband.	Monna oa ka.
He did not know the man well.	O ne a sa tsebe monna eo hantle.
There was no power in his work.	Ho ne ho se na matla mosebetsing oa hae.
Thank you for this opportunity.	Ke leboha monyetla ona.
Last year today.	Selemong se fetileng kajeno.
Go back to start.	Khutlela ho qala.
You've done this kind of thing all your life.	U entse ntho ea mofuta ona bophelo bohle ba hau.
Look and see.	Sheba o bone.
At the time they were going the same way.	Ka nako eo ba ne ba tsamaea ka tsela e tšoanang.
It's not very fun.	Ha ho monate haholo.
He eats every three hours.	O ja lihora tse ling le tse ling tse tharo.
I was just thinking about doing the same thing.	Ke ne ke nahana feela ka ho etsa ntho e tšoanang.
She looked at him intently.	A mo sheba ka hloko.
Do your parents know where you are?	Na batsoali ba hao baa tseba moo u leng teng?
Why is that so?	Hobaneng ho le joalo?
I think everyone knows that.	Ke nahana hore bohle ba tseba seo.
Some of them.	Ba bang ba bona.
One does not need that.	Motho ha a hloke seo.
However, good work.	Leha ho le joalo, mosebetsi o motle.
But that's a good thing.	Empa ke ntho e ntle.
So it allows us to be.	Kahoo e re lumella ho ba joalo.
I need to hear him.	Ke hloka ho mo utloa.
He never wrote again.	Ha a ka a ngola hape.
It would have been a very strange thing if it had existed.	E ka be e bile ntho e makatsang haholo haeba e ne e le teng.
But he was not.	Empa o ne a se joalo.
I study him again.	Ke mo ithuta hape.
That's what they did.	Ke ntho eo ba neng ba e etsa.
Sleep longer.	Robala nako e telele.
We were good friends.	Re ne re le metsoalle e molemo.
You do not know how things will work out.	Ha u tsebe hore na lintho li tla tsamaea joang.
He was not where he should be.	O ne a se moo a lokelang ho ba teng.
He knew why he did not know it.	O ne a tseba lebaka leo a neng a sa e tsebe.
Think about this carefully.	Nahana ka sena ka hloko.
He just wants to talk.	O batla ho bua feela.
He eats every day.	O ja letsatsi le letsatsi.
Do not forget them.	Bona o seke oa ba lebala.
Maybe he's here now.	Mohlomong o teng hona joale.
If one can read and understand.	Haeba motho a ka bala le ho utloisisa.
Make sure.	Etsa bonnete ba hore.
But it met.	Empa e ile ya kopana.
The night will take a long time.	Bosiu bo tla nka nako e telele.
We want to hear from you !.	Re batla ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena!.
I do what he did not do.	Ke etsa seo a sa kang a se etsa.
We will not be able to do that.	Re ke ke ra khona ho etsa joalo.
But at first it was more difficult.	Empa pele e ne e le thata ho feta.
Today, it is.	Kajeno, ho joalo.
I got it from someone else.	Ke e fumane ho motho e mong.
But they do not know what to do.	Empa ha ba tsebe seo ba lokelang ho se etsa.
I tried to be.	Ke ile ka leka ho ba.
This makes it easier.	Sena se etsa hore ho be bonolo.
It could be you.	E ka ba uena.
However, now we see how it goes.	Leha ho le joalo, joale re bona hore na e tsamaea joang.
However, he felt something was wrong.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a utloa hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
You trust him.	Ua mo tšepa.
Or whatever.	Kapa eng kapa eng.
No one knows what he is doing.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang seo a se etsang.
They will win the team.	Ba tla hlola sehlopha.
She is your teacher.	Ke tichere ea hao.
You can do anything and do it right.	O ka etsa eng kapa eng mme o etsa hantle joalo.
After that everything works fine.	Ka mor'a moo tsohle li sebetsa hantle.
I could have done without that.	Nka be ke entse ntle le seo.
Maybe there is another reason.	Mohlomong ho na le lebaka le leng.
They had never had a chance.	Ba ne ba eso ka ba ba le monyetla o lekaneng.
Just a thought.	Mohopolo feela.
It was fun today.	Ho bile monate kajeno.
I will find a way.	Ke tla fumana tsela.
I wanted something.	Ke ne ke batla ho hong.
There was no time to meet anyone.	Ho ne ho se nako ea ho kopana le mang kapa mang.
It wasn’t a lot of money, but it was at the time.	E ne e se chelete e ngata, empa e ne e le ka nako eo.
Anything is because you want them to be there.	Ntho efe kapa efe ke hobane o batla hore ba teng.
He is indeed a working man.	Ka sebele ke motho oa mosebetsi.
However, it is not good.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e ntle.
It was not an easy decision.	E ne e se qeto e bonolo.
His feet were bare.	Maoto a hae a ne a le feela.
Sleep as you read this!	Robala ha u ntse u bala sena!
There are people who want to live.	Ho na le batho ba batlang ho phela.
They found a way.	Ba ile ba fumana tsela.
It's easy.	Ho bonolo.
This was not easy for him.	Sena se ne se se bonolo ho eena.
I don't even know what that was.	Ha ke tsebe le hore na hoo e ne e le eng.
We are not the law.	Ha re molao.
See, the man is falling.	Bona, monna o a wa.
He did not like her.	O ne a sa mo rate.
Nako.	Nako.
It was hard to see many things outside.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bona lintho tse ngata ka ntle.
He loves them.	O a ba rata.
I think it was an idea of ​​any kind.	Ke nahana hore e ne e le mohopolo oa mofuta ofe kapa ofe.
But we did not find it.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra e fumana.
One day he died.	Ka letsatsi le leng o ile a hlokahala.
Did they do that.	Na ba ile ba etsa joalo.
I will never meet him again.	Ha ke sa tla kopana le eena hape.
I may have to do some work to fix that.	Nka tlameha ho etsa mosebetsi o itseng ho lokisa seo.
Maybe you should.	Mohlomong u lokela.
But it would never happen again.	Empa e ne e ke ke ea hlola e e-ba teng.
If he was, we would have stayed there that day.	Haeba a le teng, re ne re tla lula moo letsatsi leo.
You will probably know.	Mohlomong o tla tseba.
Now, he knew.	Jwale, o ne a tseba.
They learned it later.	Ba ile ba ithuta eona ka mor’a moo.
Such people do not care if you do everything for them.	Batho ba joalo ha ba tsotelle hore na u ba etsetsa ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
So that's your call.	Kahoo ke mohala oa hau.
The process is simple.	Mokhoa ona o bonolo.
It did not help.	Ha ea ka ea thusa.
He decided to try another method.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho leka mokhoa o mong.
Four if two.	Ea bone haeba e le bobeli.
He should not have slept.	O ne a sa lokela ho robala.
She has always felt close to her parents.	Haesale a ikutloa a le haufi le batsoali ba hae.
And we must win.	Mme re lokela ho hlola.
And it works well.	Mme e sebetsa hantle.
They left and went home.	Ba ile ba tloha eaba ba ea hae.
Maybe he can help them too?	Mohlomong le eena a ka ba thusa?
Not a good thing.	Ha se ntho e ntle.
I go every day.	Ke tsamaea letsatsi le leng le le leng.
He knew something was wrong.	O ne a tseba hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso haholo.
Maybe yes, maybe no.	Mohlomong e, mohlomong che.
But without much thought.	Empa ntle le ho nahana haholo.
I want to get out of here.	Ke batla ho tsoa mona.
However, so do others.	Leha ho le joalo, le ba bang.
And my children too.	Le bana ba ka hape.
I want you to be easy.	Ke batla hore o be bonolo.
They drank heavily.	Ba ne ba noa haholo.
Sometimes he gets nothing.	Ka linako tse ling ha a fumane letho.
No one will ever see us.	Ha ho motho ea tla re bona.
I'm not sure what's going on with you.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahalang ka uena.
I know how to work.	Ke tseba ho sebetsa.
The day was not going very well.	Letsatsi le ne le sa tsamaee hantle haholo.
People love this place.	Batho ba rata sebaka sena.
Of course there was a good chance he would not return.	Ha e le hantle ho ne ho e-na le monyetla o motle oa hore a se ke a khutla.
No, he had to stay.	Che, o ile a tlameha ho lula.
I am a doctor.	Ke ngaka.
I would appreciate your help.	Ke tla leboha thuso ea hau.
Maybe this is the place to ask my question.	Mohlomong mona ke sebaka sa ho botsa potso ea ka.
He saw a girl.	O ne a bona ngoanana.
Yes, he would.	E, o ne a tla re.
Walking shoes are very important when walking.	Lieta tsa ho tsamaea li bohlokoa haholo ha motho a tsamaea.
That's the life, see.	Ke bophelo boo, le a bona.
The same has been true of many others.	Ho bile joalo le ka ba bang ba bangata.
I really need help in that area !.	Ka sebele ke hloka thuso sebakeng seo!.
You need to fix the head.	U hloka ho lokisa hlooho.
But he found that he did not want to know.	Empa o ile a fumana hore ha a batle ho tseba.
He knew he could never stand up again.	O ne a tseba hore a ke ke a hlola a ema.
Yes, that's right.	E, joalo.
This book is a heavy book.	Buka ena ke buka e boima.
It's you.	Ke uena.
I did not expect to use it again.	Ke ne ke sa lebella ho e sebelisa hape.
So, it is very good.	Kahoo, e ntle haholo.
It has never been an issue.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba taba.
This is my life.	Bona ke bophelo ba ka.
Of course it is us.	Ehlile ke rona.
Have a good time with them that night.	E-ba le nako e monate le bona bosiung boo.
And that imitates him.	Mme seo se mo etsa.
We can, we must, and we will do better.	Re ka khona, re tlameha, 'me re tla etsa betere.
She could not live with the man she was living with.	O ne a ke ke a lula le monna ea neng a lula le eena.
We really took care of it.	Ruri re ile ra e hlokomela.
With such beautiful clothes and all the others.	Ka liaparo tse ntle joalo le tse ling kaofela.
The same is true of him.	Ho joalo le ka eena.
I'm not sure what to do with the player right now.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke etse eng ka sebapali hona joale.
It says you know that others are not.	E re ua tseba hore ba bang ha ba joalo.
I no longer wanted to be present.	Ke ne ke se ke sa batle ho ba teng.
If it is not night, stop.	Haeba e se bosiu, ema.
Or something like that, though.	Kapa ntho e joalo, leha ho le joalo.
They knew my style.	Ba ne ba tseba mokhoa oa ka.
She's just fun.	O monate feela.
I've done it only a few times.	Ke e entse ka makhetlo a 'maloa feela.
It can even be fun.	E bile e ka ba monate.
But it is really strange.	Empa ka sebele e makatsang.
Everyone said she had no problem.	E mong le e mong o itse ha a na bothata.
Please find another route.	Ka kopo fumana tsela e 'ngoe.
You will never get another chance like this.	Ha ho mohla u tla fumana monyetla o mong o kang ona.
I never see them again, or maybe after a few years.	Ha ke ba bone hape, kapa mohlomong ka mor'a lilemo tse 'maloa.
It's too fast.	Ke kapele haholo.
I have never found anything in it.	Ha ke so fumane letho ho eona.
Some thought it was moving too fast.	Ba bang ba ne ba nahana hore e tsamaea kapele haholo.
I had to write a heavy letter.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho ngola lengolo le boima.
Eating is living.	Ho ja ke ho phela.
They want me to do well, they will understand.	Ba batla hore ke etse hantle, ba tla utloisisa.
So, this is useless.	Kahoo, sena ha se na thuso.
I really don’t care about it.	Ha ke hlile ha ke na taba le eona.
This should be our way.	Ena e lokela ho ba tsela ea rona.
But now, in a way, it is the same with us.	Empa joale, ka tsela e itseng, ho joalo le ka rōna.
Then he left.	Eaba oa tsamaea.
He heard nothing.	Ha aa ka a utloa letho.
The problem was lack of money.	Bothata e ne e le ho hloka chelete.
I did not want him to do that.	Ke ne ke sa batle hore a etse joalo.
This type, of course, sees them all.	Mofuta ona, ka sebele, oa bona kaofela.
The strength of the team was very strong.	Matla a sehlopha a ne a le matla haholo.
We finally had our parents.	Qetellong re ne re e-na le batsoali ba rōna.
Obviously, they had just been injured.	Ho hlakile hore ba ne ba sa tsoa kotsi.
I wish it could be that way.	Ke lakatsa eka ho ka be ho le jwalo.
We had absolutely nothing.	Ho hang re ne re se na letho.
It can be fun to help someone.	Ho ka ba monate ho thusa motho.
We just looked at them.	Re ile ra ba sheba feela.
Every now and then, the car would stop.	Nako le nako, koloi e ne e lla e ema.
I had it.	Ke ne ke e-na le eona.
This makes no sense to me.	Sena ha se na kelello ho 'na.
I can't take any now.	Ha ke khone ho nka leha e le efe hona joale.
It would take thirty years.	E ne e tla nka lilemo tse mashome a mararo.
Maybe they would just keep it.	Mohlomong ba ne ba tla e boloka feela.
This is the way of life.	Ena ke tsela ea bophelo.
He gives it, they take it.	O fana ka eona, ba e nka.
I do not live there.	Ha ke lule moo.
Look around us.	Sheba haufi le rona.
He will return.	O tla khutla.
They do their job.	Ba etsa mosebetsi oa bona.
He didn't care if they liked him or not.	O ne a sa tsotelle hore na baa mo rata kapa che.
It's just fun to play together.	Ho monate feela ho bapala hammoho.
I was right, really.	Ke bile hantle, ka 'nete.
You should definitely consider this.	Ka sebele u lokela ho nahana ka sena.
One was.	E mong e ne e le.
He was tired.	O ne a khathetse.
I really work hard.	Ke hlile ke sebetsa ka thata.
It was not his favorite room.	E ne e se kamore eo a e ratang haholo.
Just again.	Feela hape.
I still do not know his name.	Ha ke e-so tsebe lebitso la hae.
They are yours.	Ke tsa hao.
This is a good and important thing.	Ena ke ntho e ntle le ea bohlokoa.
We'll see something like this.	Re tla bona ntho e kang ena.
Everyone else does.	Ba bang kaofela ba etsa jwalo.
Of course, you can also help.	Ha e le hantle, mohlomong le uena u ka thusa.
The rest of us will get in first.	Rona ba bang re tla kena ka pele.
People know us.	Batho ba re tseba.
He did not need to ask.	O ne a sa hloke ho botsa.
I do not do that.	Ha ke etse seo.
However, it was not as fun as being there.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se monate joaloka ho ba teng.
He spoke without emotion.	O ile a bua ntle le maikutlo.
Dress up and do something fun.	Apara 'me u etse ntho e monate.
We want to make sure we get it right.	Re batla ho etsa bonnete ba hore re e fumana hantle.
Some of them have not found a job since.	Ba bang ba bona ha ba so ka ba fumana mosebetsi ho tloha ka nako eo.
But, that's what the police do.	Empa, ke seo mapolesa a se etsang.
So leave it for a second time.	Kahoo tlohela nako ea bobeli.
I will eat anything.	Ke tla ja eng kapa eng.
You haven't understood.	Ha o eso utloisise.
All, all mine.	Tsohle, tsa ka kaofela.
That is, if he wants help.	Ke hore haeba a batla thuso.
I got this, this morning.	Ke fumane sena, hoseng hona.
You know, notice that.	O ya tseba, hlokomela seo.
We want to make sure.	Re batla ho etsa bonnete.
Not sure what else you can do here.	Ha u na bonnete ba hore na u ka etsa eng hape mona.
It did not enter.	Ha ea kena.
He was still outside.	O ne a ntse a le ka ntle.
Could this be ?.	Na e ka ba see?.
I need your help.	Ke hloka thuso ea hau.
This is very fun.	Sena se monate haholo.
Now he was with them.	Joale o ne a bile a e-na le bona.
Go ahead.	Tsoela pele.
The end time is near.	Nako ea ho qetela e haufi.
They had found exactly what they were looking for.	Ba ne ba fumane hantle seo ba neng ba lebeletse ho se fumana.
He can forget about it.	A ka lebala ka eona.
It is always at the end of the day.	E lula e le qetellong ea letsatsi.
He often wanted to get out.	Hangata o ne a batla ho tsoa.
Who knew, maybe he knew.	Ke mang ea neng a tseba, mohlomong o ne a tseba.
I really like the way they happen.	Ke hlile ke rata tsela eo li etsahalang ka eona.
He said this could not be true.	O ile a re sena e ka se be 'nete.
I can't speak well.	Ha ke khone ho bua hantle.
I am at home.	Ke hae.
He was happy	O ne a thabile
He had made a mistake.	O ne a entse phoso.
.	.
Of course, to each of his.	Ehlile, ho e mong le e mong oa hae.
If you continue with both of them, it is a very good thing.	Haeba u tsoela pele ka bobeli ba tsona, ke ntho e ntle haholo.
It was just nothing.	Ho ne ho se letho feela.
This is not difficult.	Sena ha se thata.
They hug.	Ba hakana.
However, this is still not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ntse ho se joalo.
I really know that family.	Ruri lelapa leo ke le tseba.
You work and plan ahead.	U sebetsa 'me u rera esale pele.
Nothing did, at a time that seemed like a long time.	Ha ho letho le ileng la etsa, ka nako e neng e bonahala eka ke nako e telele.
You will need to make a decision soon.	O tla hloka ho etsa qeto haufinyane.
It is no longer the first.	Ha e sa le oa pele.
He wondered if they were moving on.	O ne a ipotsa hore na ebe ba ntse ba tsoela pele.
This is the most important thing to me.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa ho 'na.
Both work as one.	Bobeli ba sebetsa e le ntho e le 'ngoe.
I tried to think about it a lot.	Ke ile ka leka ho nahana ka eona haholo.
Maybe he saw, maybe he didn't see.	Mohlomong o bone, mohlomong ha a ka a bona.
How can that be?	Seo se ka etsahala joang?
Everyone here knows it.	E mong le e mong mona oa e tseba.
It has only one way.	E na le tsela e le 'ngoe feela.
I have family and friends and school.	Ke na le ba lelapa le metsoalle le sekolo.
You have time.	U na le nako.
You will need help.	O tla hloka thuso.
I thought so.	Ke ile ka nahana joalo.
It does not see the problem.	Ha se bona bothata.
They saw the problem one day while playing with a child.	Ba ile ba bona bothata ka letsatsi le leng ha ba ntse ba bapala le ngoana.
There is no reason for that.	Haho lebaka la seo.
For some more than for others.	Ho ba bang ho feta ba bang.
If it doesn't, you can't do it.	Ha e sa etse jwalo, o ke ke wa etsa jwalo.
I do not want to stay here.	Ha ke batle ho dula mona.
Without water, there would be no life.	Ntle le metsi, ho ka be ho se na bophelo.
They are all human.	Bohle ke motho ho motho.
People are buying more now than ever.	Batho ba reka lintho tse ngata hona joale ho feta pele.
You do not need anything else.	Ha o hloke letho le leng.
We'll make it look like you haven't left.	Re tla etsa hore ho bonahale eka ha oa tloha.
I couldn’t keep it up, though.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e boloka, leha ho le joalo.
He did not expect to read it.	O ne a sa lebella ho e bala.
Go ahead, young man!	Tsoela pele, mohlankana!
We have time.	Re na le nako.
My mother did not want us to.	’Mè o ne a sa re batle.
We have no way of knowing.	Ha re na mokhoa oa ho tseba.
I have no money.	Ha ke na chelete.
And he was not thinking.	Hape o ne a sa nahane.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
Of course he would make money.	Ehlile o ne a tla fumana chelete.
It can be fun.	Ho ka ba monate.
I will not try.	Ha ke na ho leka.
People give you space to do it.	Batho ba u fa sebaka sa ho e etsa.
He had done his job well.	O ne a entse mosebetsi wa hae hantle.
For you, this book is invaluable.	Ho uena, buka ena ke ea bohlokoa.
I just felt that way.	Ke ne ke ikutloa joalo feela.
I decided that was not the case.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea hore ha ho joalo.
You feel good for a whole week.	U ikutloa u le motle bakeng sa beke kaofela.
The problem is that no one really knows what he wants.	Bothata ke hore ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle hore na o batla eng.
This was very important to me.	Sena se ne se le bohlokoa haholo ho 'na.
Anyone could have watched from there.	Mang kapa mang a ka be a ile a sheba ho tloha moo.
That is why we must go now.	Ke kahoo re lokelang ho tsamaea hona joale.
This does nothing.	Sena ha se etse letho.
I feel tired just thinking about it.	Ke ikutloa ke khathetse ke ho nahana feela ka eona.
That can happen after you have a baby.	Seo se ka etsahala ka mor'a hore u be le ngoana.
I was already feeling better.	Ke ne ke se ke ntse ke ikutloa ke le betere.
Then they fell.	Eaba ba oa.
It is not true, as it happened.	Ha se 'nete, joalo ka ha ho ile ha etsahala.
Please, no.	Ka kopo, che.
I know they do.	Kea tseba hore ba etsa joalo.
He is incredibly powerful.	O matla ka tsela e makatsang.
They are waiting for your feedback.	Ba lebeletse maikutlo a hau.
The reading period began.	Nako ea ho bala e ile ea qala.
And I did it.	Mme ke ile ka e etsa.
Even now they don't know.	Le hona jwale ha ba eso tsebe.
Each method has its drawbacks.	Mokhoa o mong le o mong o na le mathata.
I really go to it.	Ke hlile ke ea ho eona.
If they are still there, drive again.	Haeba ba ntse ba le teng, khanna hape.
It took a long time this way.	Ho ile ha feta nako e telele ka tsela ena.
You are the man of the house.	U monna oa ntlo.
But it is.	Empa ho joalo.
I had no money.	Ke ne ke se na chelete.
If your baby starts to cry, just play.	Haeba ngoana oa hau a qala ho lla, bapala feela.
I feel the same way about everyone.	Ke ikutloa joalo ka batho bohle.
One knew the reason, of course.	Motho o ne a tseba lebaka, ehlile.
You can read about it here, here, here and here.	U ka bala ka eona mona, mona, mona le mona.
It was so.	Ho bile joalo.
It was the funniest thing.	E ne e le ntho e monate ka ho fetisisa.
They continued to buy new things.	Ba ile ba tsoela pele ho reka lintho tse ncha.
Yes, of course, join the group.	E, ehlile, kena sehlopheng.
The time was mine.	Nako e ne e le ea ka.
It will benefit both of us.	E tla re tsoela molemo ka bobeli.
We agreed.	Re ile ra lumela seo.
We kept it simple, very simple.	Re ile ra e boloka e le bonolo, haholo.
It just exists.	E teng feela.
I live alone here.	Ke lula ke le mong mona.
I can do the same.	Le 'na nka etsa joalo.
He could not see very well.	O ne a sa bone hantle.
I've seen that before.	Nkile ka bona eo pele.
Your hair looks very beautiful.	Moriri oa hau o shebahala o le motle haholo.
Do not tell anyone about the accident.	U se ke ua bolella mang kapa mang ka kotsi eo.
Of course, they are not helpful in any way.	Ha e le hantle, ha li na thuso ka mokhoa ofe kapa ofe.
This does not matter to you.	Sena ha se na taba le uena.
The people were happy, happy.	Batho ba ne ba thabile, ba thabile.
However, you are here now.	Leha ho le joalo, u teng hona joale.
And this can be painful.	'Me sena se ka ba bohloko.
Thanks for your help.	Ke leboha thuso ea hao.
No, that was not enough.	Che, hoo ho ne ho sa lekana.
I'm trying to finish this book.	Ke leka ho qeta buka ena.
I knew they would never do that.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ba ke ke ba etsa joalo.
I will definitely do it again.	Ka sebele ke tla e etsa hape.
When he arrived, his hands were empty.	Ha a fihla, matsoho a hae a ne a se na letho.
I think that will still be seen.	Ke nahana hore seo se sa ntse se tla bonahala.
They left immediately.	Ba tloha hang hang.
I do not know how fast this car will go.	Ha ke tsebe hore na koloi ena e tla tsamaea kapele hakae.
Make it a family affair.	Etsa hore e be taba ea lelapa.
Like, you were always there.	Joalo ka, u ne u lula u le teng.
They just don't take anything.	Ba mpa ba sa nke le letho.
You are clear to go.	U hlakile ho ea.
Probably not a time or place.	Mohlomong ha se nako kapa sebaka.
The other group seems to exist.	Sehlopha se seng se bonahala se le teng.
Things are not as they seem.	Lintho ha li joalo ka ha li bonahala.
It was just a matter of getting it.	E ne e le taba feela ea ho e fumana.
I know you have it.	Kea tseba hore u na le eona.
He certainly should be.	Ka sebele o lokela ho ba joalo.
It can be dangerous.	E ka ba kotsi.
I will not sleep here.	Ha ke na ho robala mona.
I have to learn to help people more.	Ke tlameha ho ithuta ho thusa batho ho feta.
It can be the same here.	Ho ka ba joalo le mona.
There is no way.	Haho tsela.
Trying to talk to someone she loves.	Ho leka ho bua le motho eo a mo ratang.
It shouldn’t have played this way.	E ne e sa lokela ho bapala ka tsela ena.
The question is, why, and why now?	Potso ke hore, hobane’ng, hona hobane’ng hona joale?
But if you do not know that you are doing well.	Empa haeba o sa tsebe hore o etsa hantle.
It's a beautiful place.	Ke sebaka se setle.
However, many of them are very backward.	Leha ho le joalo, tse ngata tsa tsona li khutlela morao haholo.
You should read this book.	O lokela ho bala buka ena.
Because they know.	Hobane baa tseba.
Why not.	Hobaneng u sa etse joalo.
I think that was important.	Ke nahana hore seo se ne se le bohlokoa.
However, that long road may be just what we need.	Leha ho le joalo, tsela eo e telele e ka ba eona eo re e hlokang.
And we are waiting.	Mme re emetse.
He agreed to go, without telling his family.	O ile a lumela ho ea, ntle le ho bolella lelapa la hae.
We had a great time.	Re bile le nako e monate.
He seemed too hard for that.	O ne a bonahala a le thata haholo bakeng sa seo.
Yes, it is that simple.	E, ho bonolo joalo.
And we must keep that.	Mme re lokela ho boloka seo.
You will enjoy it.	O tla e thabela.
I still can't believe this.	Ke ntse nke ke ka lumela sena.
And we had a wonderful time.	Mme re bile le nako e monate haholo.
I didn't want to be too close to him.	Ke ne ke sa rate ho ba haufi haholo le eena.
Thank you, thank you.	Kea leboha, kea leboha.
I'm useless here.	Ha ke na thuso mona.
You know, it's as simple as that.	Ua tseba, e bonolo joalo ka eona.
But he is already too late.	Empa o se a le morao haholo.
Just go.	U mpe u tsamaee.
Where do you find the time to write about them ?.	O fumana kae nako ea ho ngola ka tsona?.
You will have a wonderful party.	O tla ba le mokete o monate.
You can do this alone if you know how to do it.	U ka etsa sena u le mong haeba u tseba ho etsa joalo.
Too much.	E ngata haholo.
I would love to think about it.	Nka thabela ho nahana ka eona.
I had seen it.	Ke ne ke e bone.
That was clear in advance.	Seo se ne se hlakile esale pele.
We are trying something.	Re leka se seng.
Fix everything.	Lokisa tsohle.
I do not know if my application will work or not.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e tla sebetsa kopo ea ka kapa che.
That is clear enough.	Seo se hlakile ho lekana.
Doing real work.	Ho etsa mosebetsi wa sebele.
I'm still waiting to see it.	Ke ntse ke emetse ho e bona.
I tell it to other people.	Ke e bolella batho ba bang.
With that kind of mind, you can't see the truth.	Ka kelello ea mofuta oo, u ke ke ua bona 'nete.
From his friends.	Ho tsoa ho metsoalle ea hae.
I'm not that girl.	Ha ke ngoanana eo.
I asked him to talk to me.	Ke ile ka mo kōpa hore a bue le ’na.
By his power.	Ka matla a hae.
It was coming for him too.	E ne e tla bakeng sa hae hape.
He said it would take too long.	O itse ho tla nka nako e ngata haholo.
One way to ask about time.	Mokhoa o le mong oa ho botsa ka nako.
We got out of there very quickly.	Re ile ra tsoa moo kapele haholo.
Why he did that, no one knows now.	Hobaneng a entse joalo, ha ho motho ea tsebang hona joale.
But here, there was something else.	Empa mona, ho ne ho ena le se seng.
That didn't help.	Seo ha sea ka sa thusa.
Or whatever.	Kapa eng kapa eng.
But it was.	Empa ho ne ho le joalo.
But it is easier said than done.	Empa ho bonolo ho e bua ho feta ho e etsa.
I can even meet you tonight if you are there.	Nka ba ka kopana le uena bosiung bona haeba u le teng.
I have no intention of doing this.	Ha ke na mohopolo oa ho etsa sena.
You do not have to leave.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u tsamaee.
There is no other way to make money.	Ha ho na mokhoa o mong oa chelete.
When do you want this?	U batla see neng?
Then there is another child.	Joale ho na le ngoana e mong.
Do everything right.	Etsa tsohle hantle.
But often that is not the case.	Empa hangata ha ho joalo.
We just think it will be fun.	Re mpa re nahana hore ho tla ba monate.
It can no longer exist.	E ke ke ea hlola e e-ba teng.
They are delicious.	Li monate .
Our hands are heavy.	Matsoho a rona a boima.
This took too long.	Sena se ile sa nka nako e ngata haholo.
She was a simple girl, but she was already dead to him.	E ne e le ngoanana ea bonolo, empa o ne a se a hlokahala ho eena.
The rest will come as time goes on.	Tse ling kaofela li tla tla ha nako e ntse e ea.
Try this several times.	Leka seo ka makhetlo a 'maloa.
Not so with the idea.	Ha ho joalo ka maikutlo.
I no longer want this life.	Ha ke sa batla bophelo bona.
You probably know that.	Mohlomong ua tseba seo.
It was a matter of time.	E ne e le taba ea nako.
But as a person.	Empa joalo ka motho.
It never went back.	Ha ea ka ea khutlela morao.
This was very bad.	Sena se ne se le mpe haholo.
For now it is clear that it is.	Bakeng sa hona joale ho hlakile hore ho joalo.
Find life.	Fumana bophelo.
They could help us.	Ba ne ba ka re thusa.
Now there are no problems.	Hona joale ha ho na mathata.
Life is hard.	Bophelo bo thata.
It was my idea for shoes too.	E ne e le mohopolo oa ka bakeng sa lieta hape.
We met last night right here in this room.	Re kopane maobane bosiu hona mona ka phaposing ena.
That is why he asked for help.	Ke kahoo a ileng a kopa thuso.
No one was waiting for us there.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a re emetse moo.
There is no such thing.	Ha ho letho la mofuta oo.
It's just a thought.	Ke mohopolo feela.
They could all work, in the end.	Kaofela ba ne ba ka sebetsa, qetellong.
It was the same with the girl.	Ho ne ho le joalo le ngoanana.
He would live his life.	O ne a tla phela bophelo ba hae.
Can we drive?	A na re ka khanna koloi?
You will see.	O tla bona.
When he returns, it will be as well as happy times.	Ha a khutla, ho tla ba joalo le linako tse monate.
What did he want, he wondered.	O ne a batla eng, a ipotsa.
When something works, well, that's it.	Ha ntho e sebetsa, hantle, ke seo.
I should not have started drinking at all.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho qala ho noa ho hang.
It was him.	E ne e le eena.
We had a car accident last week.	Re bile le kotsi ea koloi bekeng e fetileng.
This trend continued beyond the last.	Tsela ena e ile ea tsoela pele ho feta ea ho qetela.
At this time however.	Ka nako ena empa.
He can no longer walk alone.	Ha a sa khona ho tsamaea a le mong.
It says something.	E bua ho hong.
But that will not happen.	Empa hoo ho ke ke ha etsahala.
I was injured.	Ke ile ka tsoa kotsi.
It's clear to me now.	Ho hlakile ho nna joale.
Are these available?	Na tsena li teng?
The police did not care what he did.	Mapolesa a ne a sa tsotelle seo a se etsang.
Our teacher is very demanding.	Tichere ea rona e batla haholo.
She looked happy for something.	O ne a shebahala a thabetse ho hong.
I hope to finish that, tonight.	Ke tšepa ho qeta seo, bosiung bona.
I can't find anything.	Ha ke fumane letho.
We meet here.	Re kopane mona.
You would not be able to find a job that is as dangerous as that.	U ke ke ua fumana mosebetsi o mong o kotsi joaloka oo.
That was the first thought.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo oa pele.
The man can write and certainly, he writes like no other.	Monna eo a ka ngola 'me ka sebele, a ngola joaloka ha ho ba bang.
It had to feel real.	E ne e tlameha ho ikutloa e le ea sebele.
I '.	Ke '.
No, it was really him.	Che, e ne e hlile e le eena.
You have to speak when you speak.	U tlameha ho bua ha u bua.
He doesn't get it.	Ha a e fumane.
I suggest you also find a better tool.	Ke fana ka maikutlo a hore le uena u fumane sebetsa se betere.
And that would often happen.	Mme seo se ne se tla etsahala hangata.
Take it, young man.	E nke, mohlankana.
We will write to replace them.	Re tla ngola ho nka sebaka sa tsona.
You would not think.	O ka se nahane.
So keep doing your job.	Kahoo tsoela pele u etse mosebetsi oa hau.
How is life going for you?	Bophelo bo ntse bo u tšoara joang?
Now, just then, a man came.	Jwale, hang feela, ha tla monna.
I am very happy to say that for now, we.	Ke thabile haholo ho bolela hore hona joale, re.
I have made some of them perhaps.	Tse ling tsa tsona ke li entse mohlomong.
Just right, in my opinion.	Hantle feela, ka maikutlo a ka.
However, this is a mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ke phoso.
And no one really knows why.	'Me ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na ke hobane'ng.
The man knows he knows.	Monna oa tseba hore oa tseba.
Without it nothing can happen.	Ntle ho eona ha ho letho le ka etsahalang.
It was nice to be there.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba moo.
There are more than ever before.	Ho na le tse ngata ho feta leha e le neng pele.
They knew what to do.	Ba ne ba tseba seo ba lokelang ho se etsa.
There is more work to do than you know.	Mosebetsi o teng ho feta kamoo o tsebang.
She was not beautiful.	O ne a se motle.
At one point the man stepped back too far.	Ka lekhetlo le leng monna eo o ile a khutla morao haholo.
So, us.	Ka hona, rona.
All of these things are important to me.	Lintho tsena kaofela ke tsa bohlokoa ho ’na.
You are just a person, whether you like it or not.	O motho feela, o rata kapa o sa rate.
But he would not miss the opportunity.	Empa o ne a ke ke a tlohela monyetla o kang ona.
It was not enough.	E ne e sa lekana.
She said she would talk to her husband first.	O ile a bolela hore o tla bua le monna oa hae pele.
First, we feel, then we understand.	Pele, re ikutloa, ebe rea utloisisa.
Or maybe it's you.	Kapa mohlomong ke uena.
And you would not find it unless you knew how to look for it.	Hape u ne u ke ke ua e bona ntle le haeba u ne u tseba ho e batla.
So we can have a home of our own.	Kahoo re ka ba le ntlo eo e leng ea rōna.
Just think of what you are doing.	Nahana feela ka seo u se etsang.
You must arrive on time.	O lokela ho fihla ka nako.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.	Ke masoabi ho lula u emetse.
Then one fell, and another.	Ebe e mong oa oa, 'me e mong.
I could not understand what he was saying.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho utloisisa seo a neng a se bua.
He left.	O ile a tsamaea.
He has always been very busy with his diet.	Haesale a phathahane haholo ka lijo tsa hae.
I love everyone.	Ke rata bohle.
I was a good doctor.	Ke ne ke le ngaka e hloahloa.
No, nothing.	Che, ha ho letho.
But indifference.	Empa ho se tsotelle.
He could have gone to friends and family.	A ka be a ile a ea ho metsoalle le ba lelapa.
Where he was.	Moo a neng a le teng.
Thank you so much for providing that.	Ke leboha haholo ho fana ka seo.
We do not know for sure.	Ha re e-so tsebe letho ka bonnete.
We know nothing.	Ha re tsebe letho.
It was my age.	E ne e le lilemo tsa ka.
I have a chance for him.	Ke na le monyetla bakeng sa hae.
No, no.	Che ke che.
As you can imagine.	Joalo ka ha o ka nahana.
We must hear it.	Re tlameha ho e utloa.
My family, my children.	Lelapa la ka, bana ba ka.
He never spoke again.	Ha a ka a hlola a bua.
Never ask someone their age.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua botsa motho lilemo tsa hae.
What’s in it, and how do we know?	Ho na le eng ho eona, ’me re tseba joang?
It was not just his ear.	E ne e se ka tsebe ea hae feela.
Find a way to talk to people.	Fumana mokhoa oa ho bua le batho.
Did you hear what he said?	Na u utloile seo a se buileng?
That was their first mistake.	Eo e bile phoso ea bona ea pele.
I made friends with him.	Ke ile ka lula metsoalle le eena.
I made it and it worked.	Ke ile ka e etsa 'me ea sebetsa.
One has to do that.	Motho o tlameha ho etsa joalo.
It doesn't make sense.	Ha e na kelello.
We found our car.	Re fumane koloi ea rona.
I think he is very good at his job.	Ke nahana hore o sebetsa hantle haholo mosebetsing oa hae.
The mind cannot imagine this.	Kelello ha e ka ke ea nahana sena.
They would do that, he knew.	Ba ne ba tla etsa hoo, o ne a tseba.
Find others if you can.	Fumana ba bang haeba u khona.
It was mine.	E ne e le ea ka.
I told her my thoughts.	Ke ile ka mo bolella maikutlo a ka.
He was certainly going to take her tonight.	Ka sebele o ne a tla mo nka bosiung bona.
They would never return.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba hlola ba khutla.
I'll just have to think about it.	Ke tla tlameha ho nahana ka eona feela.
I will give him so much.	Ke tla mo fa hakaalo.
And talk about the beautiful picture.	'Me u bue ka setšoantšo se setle.
I know he is not.	Kea tseba ha a joalo.
So they go away empty-handed.	Kahoo ba tsamaea ba se na letho.
I think a lot of people do things like that.	Ke nahana hore batho ba bangata ba etsa lintho tse joalo.
But if they do, that can be good.	Empa haeba ba etsa joalo, hoo ho ka ba molemo.
The party swam.	Mokete o ile oa sesa.
He does it because he knows it will benefit him.	O e etsa hobane a tseba hore e mo tsoela molemo.
That's the way it can be.	Ke kamoo e ka etsahalang.
You have to learn to be strong and tough.	U tlameha ho ithuta ho ba matla le ho ba thata.
I had no idea you could do this.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore o ka etsa sena.
I hope not, because he says it right.	Ke tšepa hore ha ho joalo, hobane o bolela hantle.
I hope the car was not too long.	Ke tšepa hore koloi e ne e se nako e telele haholo.
Which is true.	E leng 'nete.
I don't believe he can.	Ha ke lumele hore a ka khona.
Don't cry please.	Se ke oa lla ka kopo.
Do you expect us to leave? 	Na u lebeletse hore re tsamaee?
he says.	o re.
One was old.	E 'ngoe e ne e le khale.
The way out.	Tsela ea ho tsoa.
They know the work that he has done.	Ba tseba mosebetsi oo a o entseng.
But it can be too late.	Empa e ka ba morao haholo.
I could see that he was trying hard.	Ke ne ke bona hore o leka ka matla.
They could not tell us why.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba re bolella lebaka.
You have to be a kid, you know.	U tlameha ho ba ngoana, ua tseba.
I do not want them.	ha ke li batle.
Make it as simple as you can.	Etsa hore e be bonolo kamoo u ka khonang.
I do not know how things might happen in the future.	Ha ke tsebe hore na lintho li ka etsahala joang nakong e tlang.
It was not difficult.	Ho ne ho se thata.
The latter was already the worst.	Ea ho qetela e ne e se e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
Before that, he knew nothing.	Pele ho moo, o ne a sa tsebe letho.
I could not refuse.	Ke ne nke ke ka hana.
Get to work.	Kena mosebetsing.
There is no one behind.	Ha ho le ea mong ka morao.
Look at his hands.	Sheba matsoho a hae.
It was not easy.	Ho ne ho se bonolo.
We no longer know his real name.	Ha re sa tseba hore na lebitso la hae la sebele ke mang.
Yet there was a truth there.	Leha ho le joalo ho ne ho e-na le 'nete moo.
The point is, you do not really want to do this.	Taba ke hore, ha u hlile ha u batle ho etsa sena.
We can't ask you anything again.	Re ke ke ra o botsa letho hape.
Money is still very important to many of us.	Chelete e ntse e le bohlokoa haholo ho ba bangata ba rona.
Things like.	Lintho tse kang.
I still did not know why he was asking.	Ke ne ke ntse ke sa tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a botsa.
He needed money.	O ne a hloka chelete.
And then we can do something.	Mme ebe re ka etsa ho hong.
I have such a strong team.	Ke na le sehlopha se matla joalo.
It has to be new.	E lokela ho ba e ncha.
I can't think of what other people think of me.	Ha ke khone ho nahana ka seo batho ba bang ba se nahanang ka 'na.
You can get here.	U ka fihla mona.
If you do, this is for you.	Haeba u etsa joalo, sena ke sa hau.
I don't care about work.	Ha ke tsotelle mosebetsi.
So you can use that.	Kahoo u ka sebelisa seo.
And it soon paid off.	'Me kapele e ile ea lefa.
Obviously this was the way they used to do.	Ho hlakile hore ena e ne e le tsela eo ba neng ba tloaetse ho e etsa.
It was happening again.	E ne e etsahala hape.
Maybe he should think again, but he refuses.	Mohlomong o lokela ho nahana hape, empa a hana.
Write down each of them.	Ngola e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
But you did not say you would come today.	Empa ha e le hantle ha ua ka ua re u tla tla kajeno.
None of them had it.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a e-na le eona.
You could ask your parents if you could make some money.	U ka ’na ua botsa batsoali ba hao hore na u ka ba le chelete.
But now, no.	Empa joale, che.
To me it is nothing.	Ho 'na hase letho.
That's a good idea.	Ke mohopolo o motle.
I'm starting to fix this, now.	Ke qala ho lokisa taba ena, jwale.
Yet life went on.	Leha ho le joalo bophelo bo ile ba tsoela pele.
I can make an initial impression.	Nka etsa maikutlo a pele hang.
They were right about things like that.	Ba ne ba le hantle ka lintho tse joalo.
I wish they could have made it better.	Ke lakatsa eka ba ka be ba e entse betere.
I think they were very good.	Ke nahana hore li ne li le ntle haholo.
Take that.	Nka seo.
This goes back to this point.	Sena se khutlela morao ho fihlela mona.
And she got there quickly.	Mme o ne a fihla moo kapele.
Opportunity exists.	Monyetla o teng.
I just kept looking back just right.	Ke ile ka 'na ka sheba morao hantle feela.
You will have to hear it from everyone else.	U tla tlameha ho e utloa le ba bang kaofela.
You have to look for the good.	O tlameha ho batla ho molemo.
However he must enter.	Leha ho le joalo o tlameha ho kena.
It was a long time.	E ne e le nako e telele.
He'll take you from there.	O tla o nka ho tloha moo.
I went in and was arrested.	Ke ile ka kena ’me ka tšoaroa.
Times are hard.	Linako li boima.
My kind of fun.	Mofuta oa ka oa monate.
Sometimes it did, and sometimes it didn't.	Ka linako tse ling e ne e etsa joalo, 'me ka linako tse ling e ne e sa etse joalo.
I can call other people at work.	Ke khona ho letsetsa batho ba bang mosebetsing.
He never told us about it!	Ha ho mohla a kileng a re bolella ka taba ena!
I can't speak for very long.	Ha ke khone ho bua nako e telele haholo.
He thought nothing of it.	O ne a sa nahane letho.
In fact it did.	Ha e le hantle e ile ea etsa joalo.
They slept through the night talking.	Ba ile ba robala bosiu ba ntse ba bua.
But it is not good.	Empa ha ho molemo.
If he is still there, we will find him tomorrow.	Haeba a ntse a le teng, re tla mo fumana hosane.
There is a reason for that.	Ho na le lebaka la seo.
I would expect that.	Ke ne ke tla lebella seo.
I talked a lot about it with him.	Ke ile ka bua haholo ka eona le eena.
It's good for us.	Ho molemo ho rona.
More questions, just ask.	Lipotso tse ling hape, botsa feela.
There is absolutely no reason.	Ho hang ha ho lebaka.
You were in the background.	U ne u le ka morao.
Thank you.	Ke a leboha.
In fact, he eats nothing.	Ha e le hantle, ha a je letho.
We all have to work hard.	Kaofela ha rōna re lokela ho sebetsa ka thata.
No one knew the baby was in the room.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba hore ngoana o ka kamoreng.
I was afraid of what would happen.	Ke ne ke tšaba se tla etsahala.
Strange things are happening here.	Ho etsahala ntho tse makatsang mona.
He did not know her name.	Lebitso la hae o ne a sa le tsebe.
It offers take and take and take.	E fana le ho nka le ho nka le ho nka.
I opened the door.	Ke ile ka bula lemati.
It's just your job.	Ke mosebetsi oa hau feela.
It was a strange thing for us.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang ho rona.
My mother was like that.	'Mè o ne a le joalo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Haho phoso.
One does not know.	Motho ha a tsebe.
Danger to man.	Kotsi ho motho.
It's just a thought now.	Ke mohopolo feela jwale.
They did not.	Ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
This is usually not a problem.	Hangata sena ha se bothata.
I want you to talk to us.	Ke batla hore o bue le rona.
I wonder who thinks so.	Kea ipotsa hore na ke mang ea nahanang joalo.
Yet there was nothing they could do about it.	Leha ho le joalo ho ne ho se letho leo ba ka le etsang ka hona.
I loved her.	Ke ne ke mo rata.
I am still trying to understand this.	Ke ntse ke leka ho utloisisa taba ena.
He started saying something but did not do it.	O ile a qala ho bua ho hong empa a se ke a etsa joalo.
We want to get it.	Re batla ho e fumana.
I can't even.	Ha ke khone le.
You can read that here.	O ka bala seo mona.
He met a few old friends, and went home.	O ile a kopana le metsoalle e ’maloa ea khale, eaba o ea hae.
I want to try new things.	Ke batla ho leka lintho tse ncha.
No one is sure how much he believes.	Ha ho motho ea nang le bonnete ba hore na a lumele hakae.
I only need one.	Ke hloka e le 'ngoe feela.
Talk to your teacher if you have any problems.	Bua le tichere ea hao haeba u e-na le mathata.
One thing he knew was that it was time to leave.	Ntho e ’ngoe eo a neng a e tseba ke hore ke nako ea ho tsamaea.
If.	Haeba .
He had heard something bad last night.	O ne a utloile ntho e bohloko bosiu.
I wish you could come.	Ke lakatsa eka o ka tla.
Yet he was only telling his friends.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a bolella metsoalle ea hae feela.
You do not have to travel alone.	Ha ua lokela ho tsamaea u le mong.
You probably think of that person.	Mohlomong u nahana ka motho eo.
It happens a lot at once.	Ho etsahala tse ngata ka nako e le 'ngoe.
He seemed indifferent to it.	O ne a bonahala a sa tsotelle letho ka eona.
It was difficult to say exactly what he thought.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bolela hantle hore na o nahana eng.
That's how I did it.	Ke kamoo ke entseng kateng.
That was not the whole point.	E ne e se taba kaofela.
For everyone and no one, for everything and nothing.	Ea motho e mong le e mong le ha ho motho, ea tsohle le letho.
She has no dog.	Ha a na ntja.
Well, everyone knows that.	Joalo, bohle ba tseba seo.
Maybe it wasn’t one.	Mohlomong e ne e se 'ngoe.
It was very heavy.	E ne e le boima haholo.
So there may be a way to do the same.	Kahoo ho ka ba le mokhoa oa ho etsa se tšoanang.
I want to leave it at that.	Ke batla ho e tlohela joalo.
There is no house like this anywhere.	Ha ho na ntlo e tšoanang le ena kae kapa kae.
I could see the sun.	Ke ne ke khona ho sheba letsatsi.
And we will need what they know.	Mme re tla hloka seo ba se tsebang.
If we get into time.	Haeba re kena nakong.
The problem is not time.	Bothata ha se nako.
Can you help?	O ka thusa?
He asked about you.	O ile a botsa ka uena.
This would have been nice.	Sena se ka be se bile molemo.
It was hard work, and someone had to take it.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima, 'me motho e mong o ile a tlameha ho o nka.
He is the one she needs.	Ke eena eo a mo hlokang.
They're keeping it.	Ba ntse ba e boloka.
It will not work.	E ke ke ea sebetsa.
His friends and family no longer care.	Metsoalle ea hae le ba lelapa la hae ha ba sa na taba.
And he eats.	'Me oa ja.
And so on.	Joalo joalo.
They will come in.	Ba tla kena.
I went out to swim in the back, alone.	Ke ile ka tsoa ho ea sesa ka morao, ke le mong.
So, here is a good place to start.	Kahoo, mona ke sebaka se setle sa ho qala.
We live in the past and the present.	Re phela nakong e fetileng ea hona joale le nakong e tlang.
I was able to talk to anyone about anything.	Ke ne ke khona ho bua le mang kapa mang ka eng kapa eng.
Or even more.	Kapa le ho feta.
This is all about it.	Ena ke ea tsohle.
You must have needed it.	E tlameha ebe o ne o e hloka.
You ask him what he will do.	Ua mo botsa hore na o tla etsa joang.
I'm sure of that.	Ke na le bonnete ba seo.
He spent money.	O ile a sebelisa chelete.
Ask his name.	Botsa lebitso la hae.
But it was nothing he had ever seen.	Empa e ne e se letho leo a kileng a le bona.
I really don't need this.	Ke hlile ha ke hloke sena.
Are you with me ?.	O na le nna?.
I do not want to talk to you.	Ha ke batle ho bua le wena.
I'll see you tonight.	Ke tla le bona bosiung bona.
Of course, you are right.	Ha e le hantle, u hantle.
It’s my way of testing people.	Ke mokhoa oa ka oa ho leka batho.
Save the date.	Boloka letsatsi.
Now we meet again.	Hona joale re kopana hape.
He went home.	A ya hae.
I talked to my husband.	Ke ile ka bua le monna oa ka.
This issue exists in many others.	Taba ena e teng ho tse ling tse ngata.
It was behind me.	E ne e le ka mor'a ka.
However, now was not the time.	Leha ho le joalo, joale e ne e se nako.
Our team will be there tomorrow.	Sehlopha sa rona se tla ba teng hosane.
I certainly have never met it.	Ka sebele ha ke e-s'o kopane le eona.
I use them.	Kea li sebelisa.
The teacher helps the children to read.	Tichere e thusa bana ho bala.
So you know how early we were leaving.	Kahoo ua tseba hore na re ne re tloha hoseng hakae.
I've seen this.	Ke bone sena.
It was nice to be back.	Ho ne ho le monate ho khutla.
I could hear him.	Ke ne ke khona ho mo utloa.
How will you find your way home?	U tla fumana tsela ea hau ea ho khutlela hae joang?
You can work alone.	U ka sebetsa u le mong.
If you wanted to see it.	Haeba u ne u batla ho e bona.
I still live there.	Ke ntse ke lula moo.
We had to talk about what happened.	Re ile ra tlameha ho bua ka se etsahetseng.
Looking back, that seemed like a long time.	Ha re sheba morao, hoo ho ne ho bonahala eka ke nako e telele haholo.
He did not think.	O ne a sa nahane.
But he did not know why.	Mme o ne a sa tsebe lebaka.
I had a really good time.	Ke bile le nako e monate haholo.
So it is not.	Kahoo ha ho joalo.
Such a law should not exist before.	Molao o joalo ha oa lokela ho ba teng pele.
I am the best !.	Ke molemo ka ho fetisisa!.
No, he refused to talk about it.	Che, o ne a hana ho bua ka eona.
Obviously, it is not easy.	Ho hlakile hore ha ho bonolo.
We know what to do.	Re tseba seo re lokelang ho se etsa.
People think so.	Batho ba nahana hore ba joalo.
Obviously so.	Ho hlakile joalo.
It is never enough to know.	Ha ho mohla ho lekaneng ho tseba.
First for each of us.	Ea pele bakeng sa e mong le e mong oa rona.
Please take some money.	Ke kopa o nke chelete.
Everyone loves to save time and energy.	E mong le e mong o rata ho boloka nako le moo a ka khonang.
How will you use it?	U tla e sebelisa joang?
However, it is an opportunity.	Leha ho le joalo, ke monyetla.
He held both his hands.	A tšoara matsoho a hae ka bobeli.
I will leave that to the next job.	Ke tla tlohela seo mosebetsing o tlang.
They buy everything they need or want.	Ba reka ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe eo ba e hlokang kapa ba e batlang.
Great man.	Monna e moholo.
This he had done.	Sena o ne a se entse.
You are doing well, keep doing what you have always done.	U ntse u sebetsa hantle, tsoela pele ho etsa seo esale u se etsa.
The important thing is what you do with them '.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore na o etsa eng ka bona'.
It was a good decision.	E ne e le qeto e ntle.
It always opens at night.	E lula e bula bosiu.
That's what he meant.	Ke seo a neng a se bolela.
I've seen that.	Ke bone seo.
He did not think he could be here.	O ne a sa nahana hore a ka ba teng mona.
They were in the back of the house.	Ba ne ba le ka morao ho ntlo.
This error is always apparent.	Phoso ena e lula e bonahala.
I loved playing it in high school.	Ke ne ke rata ho e bapala sekolong se phahameng.
They returned to their place of lodging.	Ba ile ba khutlela moo ba ileng ba robala teng.
I asked him if he needed to talk.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na o hloka ho bua.
There was no time to pass.	Ho ne ho se nako ea ho feta.
I had a great time.	Ke bile le nako e monate.
Now the point is, it's always true.	Joale taba ke hore ke ‘nete kamehla.
You really need to save money.	Ha e le hantle u hloka ho boloka chelete.
It was so.	Ho ne ho le joalo.
We cared for him until morning.	Re ile ra mo hlokomela ho fihlela hoseng.
I'm too late for that now.	Ke morao haholo bakeng sa seo jwale.
In fact, he refused to give us any name.	Ha e le hantle, o ile a hana ho re fa le lebitso.
For one of us.	Bakeng sa e mong oa rona.
I spend a lot of time with her boyfriend.	Ke qeta nako e ngata le mohlankana oa hae.
But nothing provided.	Empa ha ho letho le ileng la fana.
It was easy to use.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho e sebelisa.
This makes working harder.	Sena se etsa hore ho sebetsa ho be thata.
He would pay her back.	O ne a tla mo lefa.
My place is very close to it.	Sebaka sa ka se haufi haholo le eona.
It lasted for several years.	E ile ea tsoela pele ka lilemo tse ’maloa.
It makes you think.	E etsa hore u nahane.
I'm just telling you that.	Ke o bolella seo feela.
I was about to start walking when someone called behind me.	Ke ne ke le haufi le ho qala ho tsamaea ha motho e mong a letsa ka mor'a ka.
It will only take time.	Ho tla nka nako feela.
We always work	Re sebetsa kamehla
Now he needed to work hard.	Hona joale o ne a hloka ho sebetsa ka thata.
We will play it by ear.	Re tla e bapala ka tsebe.
It is real when both people hear it.	Ke ntho ea sebele ha batho ka bobeli ba e utloa.
The truth is the truth.	'Nete ke 'nete.
I did not want to go there at all.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho ea moo ho hang.
I can't understand it.	Ha ke khone ho e utloisisa.
All you have to do is learn to talk.	Seo u hlokang ho se etsa feela ke ho ithuta ho bua.
The place was beautiful.	Sebaka e ne e le se setle.
Well my opinion.	Hantle maikutlo a ka.
But don't keep thinking about that.	Empa o seke wa dula o nahana ka seo.
You know you want one.	Ua tseba hore u batla e le 'ngoe.
Now is her time.	Joale ke nako ea hae.
I would say it was really good.	Nka re e ne e hlile e le molemo.
Now that too is gone.	Jwale seo le sona se ile.
But he never said much.	Empa ha ho mohla a kileng a bua haholo.
Knowing that it is too late.	Ho tseba hore e se e le morao haholo.
They had a child together.	Ba ne ba e-na le ngoana hammoho.
It is better not to think about this too much.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua nahana ka sena haholo.
However, there is good news.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le litaba tse monate.
We could not repair this place.	Ha re khone ho lokisa sebaka sena.
I just sat there.	Ke ile ka lula feela.
I can believe it.	Ke khona ho e lumela.
I want to be alone, today.	Ke batla ho ba mong, kajeno.
And so he would play that.	Mme ka hona o ne a tla bapala seo.
However, you need to be careful.	Leha ho le joalo, u lokela ho hlokomela.
I do not find such help in it.	Ha ke fumane thuso e joalo ho eona.
I don’t know anyone who can, but maybe they can.	Ha ke tsebe mang kapa mang ea ka khonang, empa mohlomong ba ka khona.
Or maybe it was to help their children.	Kapa mohlomong e ne e le ho thusa bana ba bona.
We can go.	Re ka tsamaea.
They were coming for him, and soon.	Ba ne ba tla bakeng sa hae, mme kapele.
You can learn something.	O ka ithuta ho hong.
This is a very important job.	Ena ke mosebetsi oa bohlokoa haholo.
Her most important job was to take care of her son.	Mosebetsi oa hae oa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa e ne e le ho hlokomela mora oa hae.
But not immediately.	Empa ha ho joalo hang hang.
Here, one should not try to think, one must feel.	Mona, motho ha a lokela ho leka ho nahana, o tlameha ho ikutloa.
Ask a few questions about the person.	Botsa lipotso tse 'maloa ka motho eo.
It is true that you can love a person but not be able to benefit him or her.	Ke ’nete hore u ka rata motho empa u sa khone ho mo tsoela molemo.
You are not the first one.	Ha se uena oa pele.
Now we know he didn't take it.	Jwale re a tseba ha a ka a e nka.
Count your age to dog age.	Bala lilemo tsa hau ho lilemo tsa ntja.
They both loved to sleep.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba rata ho robala.
I have had very bad ones.	Ke bile le tse mpe haholo.
But it does not matter why we are here.	Empa ha se taba ea hore na ke hobane'ng ha re le mona.
And just to see where your power is.	Le ho bona feela moo matla a hao a leng teng.
He did just that.	O entse seo hantle.
This cannot be.	Sena e ka se be eona.
He never does that.	Ha ho mohla a etsang joalo.
However, finding the place was not easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ho fumana sebaka seo ho ne ho se bonolo.
Play again.	Bapala hape.
Like before any of us knew.	Joalo pele leha e le mang oa rona a tseba.
Some are new.	Tse ling li ncha.
These children need a doctor.	Bana bana ba hloka ngaka.
Of course, he did not know if anything was happening.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a sa tsebe hore na ho na le ntho e etsahalang.
Moreover, it probably didn't matter much.	Ho feta moo, mohlomong ho ne ho se na taba e ngata.
No, more than that.	Che, ho feta moo.
It was usually the best time of the night.	Hangata e ne e le nako e monate ka ho fetisisa ea bosiu.
I know you do your best.	Kea tseba hore u etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang.
If you have been there, you will come back.	Haeba u kile ua ba teng, u tla khutla.
The task was extremely difficult.	Mosebetsi o ne o le boima haholo.
Otherwise you read once and you're done.	Ho seng joalo u bala hang ebe u qetile.
I believe there can be a problem.	Ke lumela hore ho ka ba le bothata.
The same is true for you.	Ho joalo le ka ea hau.
Here is the truth.	'Nete ke ena.
But that did not seem to be so.	Empa seo ha sea ka sa utloa eka ke 'nete hakaalo.
Too many things at once.	Ke lintho tse ngata haholo ka nako e le 'ngoe.
However, this is not a question.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se potso.
If he wants something, he will get it.	Haeba a batla ntho e itseng, o tla e fumana.
And this is no better time than now.	Mme ena ha se nako e betere ho feta ya jwale.
This process took years.	Mokhoa ona o ile oa nka lilemo.
The sooner it arrives, the better for us.	Ha e fihla kapele, e tla ba molemo ho rona.
They were close now.	Ba ne ba le haufi jwale.
It means he has done it before.	Ho bolela hore o kile a e etsa pele.
For some people the risk is significant, for others it is not.	Ho batho ba bang kotsi ke ea bohlokoa, ho ba bang ha ho joalo.
So for the great good.	Kahoo bakeng sa molemo o moholo.
They are able to work longer hours.	Ba khona ho sebetsa nako e telele.
No thought of asking her for dinner.	Ha ho mohopolo oa ho mo kopa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
There was nothing here, nothing.	Ho ne ho se letho mona, ho se letho.
But wait there is more.	Empa ema ho na le ho feta.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
Yes, that can be the same.	E, hoo e ka ba ntho e le 'ngoe.
However, he thought, he could not have another one.	Leha ho le joalo, a nahana, a ke ke a ba le e 'ngoe.
If he had wanted to, he could have gone back to his parents.	Hoja a ne a batla, a ka be a ile a khutlela ho batsoali ba hae.
I have a feeling that it too will not survive.	Ke na le maikutlo a hore le eona e ke ke ea phela.
That was my job.	Oo e ne e le mosebetsi oa ka.
There is a new one.	Ho na le e ncha.
It will work either way.	E tla sebetsa ka tsela efe kapa efe.
You can do that.	Le ka etsa joalo.
It was just a matter of them being there.	E ne e le taba feela hore ba ne ba le teng.
No, nothing right now.	Che, ha ho letho hona joale.
It is not an easy picture to take in my opinion.	Ha se setšoantšo se bonolo ho se nka ka maikutlo a ka.
It will be quick to get in and out.	E tla ba kapele ho kena le ho tsoa.
School nights.	Bosiu ba sekolo.
I was always trying to learn.	Ke ne ke lula ke leka ho ithuta.
I'll tell you now.	Ke tla o bolella jwale.
I know what to do.	Ke tseba seo ke lokelang ho se etsa.
We will do this.	Re tla etsa sena.
All if so.	Tsohle haeba ho joalo.
She is not a mother at all.	Ha se mme ho hang.
So, what will it take to get to you?	Joale, ho tla nka eng ho fihla ho uena?
I helped, of course.	Ke ile ka thusa, ehlile.
You can say that again, too.	O ka bua seo hape, le hape.
I do not need.	ha ke hloke.
He saw the truth in her.	O ile a bona ’nete ka eena.
It's fun too.	Le eona e monate.
I just made a mistake.	Ke entse phoso feela.
You talk a lot about team work.	U bua haholo ka mosebetsi oa sehlopha.
I asked how long he had been there.	Ke ile ka botsa hore na o bile moo nako e kae.
Now is the time for me to speak.	Jwale ke nako ya hore ke bue.
I know a guy.	Ke tseba mohlankana.
Then, try again.	Ebe, leka hape.
I did something.	Ke entse ho hong.
That seems to work well.	Seo se bonahala se sebetsa hantle.
He was trying, but he was here before.	O ne a leka, empa o bile mona pele.
I'm not so sure.	Ha ke na bonnete hakaalo.
I'll ask tonight, he thought.	Ke tla botsa bosiung bona, a nahana.
He would think of me in his own way more than ever before.	O ne a tla nahana ka 'na ka tsela ea hae ho feta leha e le neng pele.
I know my team.	Ke tseba sehlopha sa ka.
What we knew to be true was not true.	Seo re neng re tseba hore ke ’nete e ne e se ’nete.
Of course this is already happening.	Ehlile sena se se se ntse se etsahala.
Find a job that you enjoy.	Fumana mosebetsi oo u o ratang.
I can't do this.	Ha ke khone ho etsa sena.
Absolutely not possible.	Ho hang ho ne ho ke ke ha etsahala.
You do the same.	Le uena u etsa joalo.
They travel a lot.	Li tsamaea haholo.
If you do, you will have a problem.	Haeba u etsa joalo, u tla ba le bothata.
I refused to believe that.	Ke ile ka hana ho lumela seo.
When he was done, he was done.	Ha a qetile, o ne a qetile.
He saves a lot of time.	O boloka nako haholo.
You do not know what it means until you are there.	Ha o tsebe hore na ntho e bolela eng ho fihlela o le teng.
This could be it.	Sena se ka ba sona.
One man has a better chance.	Monna a le mong o na le monyetla o betere.
I'm not a tough player.	Ha ke sebapali se thata.
It made me think of her mother.	E ile ea etsa hore ke nahane ka ’mè oa hae.
It's kind of painful.	Ke mofuta oa bohloko.
I was grateful for that.	Ke ile ka leboha seo.
One is better.	E 'ngoe e betere.
Of course he was.	Ehlile o ne a le jwalo.
This should not be the case.	Sena ha sea lokela ho ba joalo.
It really is a thing.	Ehlile ke ntho.
He must continue to work.	O tlameha ho tsoela pele ho sebetsa.
He refused to let her go.	A hana ho mo tlohela.
Many people will be injured.	Batho ba bangata ba tlo tsoa kotsi.
And we don't have a week.	Mme ha re na beke.
Everyone needs good friends.	E mong le e mong o hloka metsoalle e molemo.
I already know who he is.	Ke se ke ntse ke tseba hore na ke mang.
Do not do that again.	O seke wa etsa seo hape.
I will take care of it all.	Ke tla e hlokomela kaofela.
I do not understand anything that happened tonight.	Ha ke utloisise letho le etsahetseng bosiung bona.
But that is the second question.	Empa eo ke potso ea bobeli.
I have no breakfast.	Ha ke na lijo tsa hoseng.
Nobody wants to come here, we know that.	Haho motho ya ratang ho tla mona, re tseba seo.
Well, he is not.	Be, ha a eo.
But that is not what he wants to hear.	Empa ha se seo a batlang ho se utloa.
And we'll talk about that a little bit.	Mme re tla bua ka taba eo hanyane.
But the other three are not.	Empa tse ling tse tharo ha li joalo.
What anyone would want.	Seo mang kapa mang a ka se batlang.
They considered it to be a way of life.	Ba ne ba e nka e le tsela ea bophelo.
I have to help them.	Ke tlameha ho ba thusa.
Very interesting, he asked her.	Ho monate haholo, o ile oa mo botsa.
It dresses well.	E apara hantle.
I think the kids have something.	Ke nahana hore bana ba na le ntho e itseng.
I did not ask to be.	Ha kea ka ka botsa ho ba.
Maybe there was.	Mohlomong ho ne ho le teng.
It will help.	E tla thusa.
Like many before me.	Joalo ka ba bangata pele ho nna.
We cannot continue this way.	Re ke ke ra tsoela pele ka tsela ena.
He entered the room.	A kena ka phaposing.
You can still walk you know.	U ntse u ka tsamaea ua tseba.
One of them was very nice.	E 'ngoe ea tsona e ne e le ntle haholo.
There is.	Ho na le.
But he had his best days.	Empa o ile a ba le matsatsi a hae a monate.
Let me tell you.	E re ke o bolelle.
While this work is fun, it is not so important.	Le hoja mosebetsi ona o le monate, ha oa bohlokoa hakaalo.
I know he must have been hurt.	Kea tseba hore e tlameha ebe o utloile bohloko.
It's not that hard.	Ha e thata hakaalo.
They are both curious.	Ka bobeli ke batho ba ratang ho tseba.
I'm just with you.	Ke na le uena feela.
He would love that.	A ka rata seo.
We do not believe.	Ha re lumele.
He asked us what was going on.	O ile a re botsa hore na ho etsahala'ng.
They know this.	Ba tseba sena.
He was playing with his children.	O ne a bapala le bana ba hae.
We will have to pay.	Re tla tlameha ho lefa.
What, what.	Ke eng, ke eng.
We know it.	Re e tseba.
He did not say where.	Ha a ka a bolela kae.
He was the only person they could trust.	E ne e le eena feela motho eo ba neng ba ka mo tšepa.
I know it was very close.	Kea tseba hore le ne le le haufi haholo.
To you and others.	Ho uena le ba bang.
As you can see .	Joalo ka ha u bona .
So it's up to you.	Kahoo ho ho uena.
He did not know.	O ne a eso tsebe.
He says there will be work for me there.	O re ho tla ba le mosebetsi bakeng sa ka moo.
And we must.	'Me re tlameha.
He can have one.	A ka ba le e mong.
You do not have to be.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u be monate.
Maybe this happens first.	Mohlomong sena se etsahala pele.
I would like to know.	Ke lakatsa ho tseba.
That's very nice.	Seo se setle haholo.
Finally.	Qetellong.
I have space.	Ke na le sebaka.
No one was going to buy it.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tla e reka.
He never caught us.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a re tšoara .
I did not realize that.	Ha kea ka ka hlokomela seo.
It's just anything.	Ke eng kapa eng feela.
My father would not say such a thing.	Ntate o ne a ke ke a bua ntho e joalo.
I think we will.	Ke nahana hore re tla etsa joalo.
I took care of him, of course.	Ke ile ka mo hlokomela, ehlile.
No need.	Ha ho hlokahale.
And you need something like that.	'Me u hloka ntho e joalo.
But no one wanted it.	Empa ho ne ho se motho ea e batlang.
Soon we will learn the truth.	Haufinyane re tla ithuta ’nete.
It was just one, you might say.	E ne e le 'ngoe feela, u ka re.
He got up and came to me.	A ema mme a tla ho nna.
I have to write a letter tonight.	Ke tlameha ho ngola lengolo bosiung bona.
I was there.	Ke ne ke le teng moo.
Perhaps they too believed in the same things about him.	Mohlomong le bona ba ne ba lumela lintho tse joalo ka eena.
They know where we are going.	Ba tseba moo re tla tlameha ho ea teng.
Eventually they will win.	Qetellong ba tla hlola.
Parents and their children.	Batsoali le bana ba bona.
We do not have to guess.	Ha re a tlameha ho nahana esale pele hakaalo.
There is no way at all.	Ho hang ha ho tsela.
You think you know what they are doing.	U nahana hore u tseba seo ba se etsang.
He couldn't wear it now.	O ne a ke ke a e apara jwale.
He was very helpful.	O ile a thusa haholo.
See what he says.	Bona seo a se buang.
I don't have much time anymore.	Ha ke sa na nako e ngata.
These and many more.	Tsena le tse ling tse ngata.
Have you just seen her?	A na u sa tsoa mo bona?
That was not necessary at all.	Seo se ne se sa hlokahale ho hang.
There was something new.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho e ncha.
Probably a man and a woman.	Mohlomong monna le mosali.
We just had a great time.	Re sa tsoa ba le nako e monate haholo.
Then he will not cry.	Joale a ke ke a lla.
We must learn to live together.	Re tlameha ho ithuta ho phela hammoho.
You treat the thing as it really is.	U tšoara ntho kamoo e leng kateng.
This is our life and we love what we do.	Bona ke bophelo ba rona mme re rata seo re se etsang.
We sat down together, hugging each other hard.	Re ile ra lula fatše hammoho, re hakana ka thata.
Love someone.	Rata motho e mong.
He did not understand what had just happened.	O ne a sa utloisise se sa tsoa etsahala.
I hope you can enjoy it.	Ke tšepa hore u ka e thabela.
Of course, it was.	Ha e le hantle, ho ne ho le joalo.
I can retire now.	Nka tlohela mosebetsi hona joale.
So, you know, we'll have to see.	Kahoo, ua tseba, re tla tlameha ho bona.
Which should be enough.	E leng se lokelang ho lekana.
You will not be able to identify the old house.	U ke ke ua khona ho tseba ntlo ea khale.
Walk carefully.	Tsamaea ka hloko.
However, there was no point in it.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se na thuso bakeng sa eona.
It was as if you were his own.	E ne eka u oa hae.
It's hard to imagine it.	Ho thata ho nahana hantle.
Anything that always happens has a reason, why it happens.	Eng kapa eng e etsahalang kamehla e na le lebaka, hobaneng e etsahala.
That is what had to happen.	Ke sona se neng se lokela ho etsahala.
Keep writing and asking difficult questions.	Tsoela pele ho ngola le ho botsa lipotso tse thata.
You don't have to do anything.	Ha o a tlameha ho etsa letho.
Just one of them may be empty.	E le 'ngoe feela ea tsona e ka ba e se nang letho.
No need, out here.	Ha ho hlokahale, ka ntle mona.
It was the best practice.	E ne e le mokhoa o motle ka ho fetisisa.
They needed to stay together.	Ho ne ho hlokahala hore ba lule hammoho.
But since then, it has taken my house and my life.	Empa ho tloha ka nako eo, e nkile ntlo ea ka le bophelo ba ka.
Doing is my thing.	Ho etsa ke ntho ea ka.
We wanted to do this.	Re ne re batla ho etsa sena.
People need to know what happened.	Batho ba lokela ho tseba se etsahetseng.
This is a real shopping experience.	Ena ke ntho ea sebele ea ho reka.
All people are equal.	Batho bohle baa lekana.
He would have to leave.	O ne a tla tlameha ho tsamaea.
Yeah, that's right, but he seems to be working.	Ho joalo, ho joalo, empa o bonahala a sebetsa.
I usually drink a lot of coffee.	Hangata ke noa kofi e ngata.
It will be difficult for a long time.	Ho tla ba thata ka nako e telele.
Another three hours passed.	Ho ile ha feta lihora tse ling tse tharo.
The danger was real.	Kotsi e ne e le ea sebele.
I am still one of us.	Ke ntse ke le e mong oa rona.
This festival, the first one, is a real celebration.	Mokete ona, oa pele, ke mokete oa sebele.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
She was afraid he would not let her.	O ne a tšaba hore a ke ke a mo lumella.
That should not be the case.	Seo ha sea lokela ho ba teng.
Everything was where it should be, he realized.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e le moo e lokelang ho ba teng, o ile a hlokomela.
I usually have a mom.	Hangata ke na le 'Mè.
It is not as easy as you think.	Ha ho bonolo joalo ka ha u nahana.
But today, they will be there.	Empa kajeno, ba tla ba teng.
And now they are worse off than they were before.	Mme jwale ba mpe le ho feta kamoo ba neng ba le kateng pele.
Obviously, he could not stand.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a ke ke a hlola a ema.
We know how to make it better than anyone else.	Re tseba ho e etsa betere ho feta mang kapa mang.
I'd like to go to bed right away.	Ke kopa ho robala hang hang.
My father was in it.	Ntate o ne a le ho eona.
We knew it was real.	Re ne re tseba hore ke ntho ea sebele.
He is indeed the only one.	Ka sebele ke eena feela.
I did not want to use it.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho e sebelisa.
He wanted to go with her.	O ne a batla ho tsamaea le eena.
You need it now.	U e hloka hona joale.
Which is really not the case.	E leng hore ha e le hantle hase 'nete.
He too meant it.	Le eena o ne a e bolela.
No one knew what they were doing.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba seo ba se etsang.
The girl came a second time.	Ngoanana a tla ka lekhetlo la bobeli.
It didn't need to say much.	Ho ne ho sa hloke ho bua haholo.
There is only one thing.	Ho na le ntho e 'ngoe feela.
I did not stay long.	Ha kea lula nako e telele ruri.
This did not happen for a long time here.	Sena se ne se sa etsahala nako e telele mona.
Maybe some things are just that.	Mohlomong lintho tse ling li joalo feela.
Reading time begins!	Nako ea ho bala e qala!
Stay here if you wish.	Lula mona haeba u lakatsa.
He started writing.	O ile a qala ho ngola.
It is not certain what happened to them.	Ha ho na bonnete ba hore na ho etsahetseng ka bona.
You want something better.	U batla ho hong ho molemo.
Best for me.	Molemo ka ho fetisisa ho nna.
She looked like she was crying.	O ne a shebahala eka o ntse a lla.
But he knew he had to try.	Empa o ne a tseba hore o lokela ho leka.
I can only guess what it means.	Nka mpa ka bolela hore na e bolela eng.
I will fix it the way he likes.	Ke tla e lokisa ka tsela eo a e ratang.
Her son had seen the man.	Mora oa hae o ne a bone monna eo.
Your pain is still there.	Bohloko ba hau bo ntse bo le teng.
They were delicious to eat.	Li ne li le monate ho ja.
More than giving.	Ho feta ho fana.
Very good book.	Buka e ntle haholo.
I knew she would be fine.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o tla phela hantle.
Time to go home.	Nako ea ho ea hae.
There is nothing else.	Ha ho letho le leng le teng.
He said he was there.	O itse o ne a le teng.
I am here to help.	Ke mona ho tla thusa.
I could not overcome the problems.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho hlola mathata.
He was not there, of course.	O ne a le sieo, ehlile.
He has power.	O na le matla.
I was just starting to call him.	Ke ne ke qala ho mo letsetsa.
He wanted it.	O ne a o batla.
He's just a weird person.	Ke motho ya makatsang feela.
We were in school together.	Re ne re le sekolong hammoho.
At night for breakfast.	Bosiu ka lijo tsa hoseng.

There is something very wrong.	Ho na le ho hong ho phoso haholo.
Give one way.	Fana ka tsela e le 'ngoe.
Some began to weep.	Ba bang ba ile ba qala ho lla.
I feel like you will not be able to eat enough.	Ke ikutloa eka u ke ke ua khona ho ja ka ho lekaneng.
I live the longest.	Ke lula nako e telele ka ho fetisisa.
The woman also saw him.	Mosali le eena o ile a mo bona.
If one can, time is not the reason.	Haeba motho a khona, nako ha se lebaka.
He realized all that he had done.	O ile a hlokomela tsohle tseo a li entseng.
He loved her very much.	O ne a mo rata haholo.
I would like to.	Nka thabela ho.
It was so.	Ho bile joalo.
It seems to work.	E bonahala e sebetsa.
Some like it.	Ba bang ba e rata.
Neither do I.	Le nna ha ke etse jwalo.
This is the first one.	Ena ke ea pele.
Now, of course, we were not their children.	Joale, ha e le hantle, re ne re se bana ba bona.
No one knows anything.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang letho.
Her parents were expecting her to find a good job.	Batsoali ba hae ba ne ba lebeletse hore o tla fumana mosebetsi o motle.
Working with him was fun.	Ho sebetsa le eena ho ne ho le monate.
We hope you will visit us soon !.	Re tšepa hore u tla re etela haufinyane!.
And the hair that used to be beautiful and alive.	Le moriri o neng o kile oa ba motle mme oa phela.
It just happens that way.	E etsahala ka tsela eo feela.
It was just me and trying to live my life.	E ne e le 'na feela le ho leka ho phela bophelo ba ka.
We refuse to do so here.	Re hana ho etsa joalo mona.
That's what did it.	Ke sona se entseng seo.
And mom and dad too.	Le mme le ntate le bona.
This was bad.	Sena se ne se le mpe.
Get away from me! 	Tloha ho 'na!
I was not expecting.	Ke ne ke sa lebella.
the boy cried.	moshanyana a lla.
It needs money.	E hloka chelete.
It really happened.	E ne e hlile e etsahala.
And for your dog.	Le bakeng sa ntja ea hau.
Situation is a condition.	Boemo ke boemo.
I would not give this to anyone.	Ke ne nke ke ka fana ka sena ho mang kapa mang.
You have.	U bile le.
Enough to eat.	Ho lekana ho ja.
I heard him, he was very close.	Ke ile ka mo utloa, o ne a le haufi haholo.
He played three times for the team before retiring.	O ile a bapala linako tse tharo bakeng sa sehlopha pele a tlohela mosebetsi.
And there were other problems.	'Me ho ne ho e-na le mathata a mang.
Find someone you love and love again.	Fumana motho eo u mo ratang le ea u ratang hape.
Absolutely not possible.	Ho hang ho ne ho ke ke ha etsahala.
I feel like a child again.	Ke ikutloa joaloka ngoana hape.
They were already friends.	E ne e se e le metsoalle.
You know how it is.	Ua tseba hore na ho joang.
But, we can know more.	Empa, re ka e tseba haholoanyane.
There is no water.	Haho metsi.
I don't think anyone will do that.	Ha ke nahane hore ho na le motho ea tla etsa joalo.
Do something about them.	Etsa ho hong ka bona.
I don't think he was ever good.	Ha ke nahane hore o kile a ba motle.
They soon learned that something was wrong.	Kapele ba ile ba tseba hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
Prepare and do.	Lokisa 'me u etse.
It wouldn't do it.	E ne e ka se etse.
I was beginning to wonder how long it would take.	Ke ne ke qala ho ipotsa hore na ho nka nako e telele hakae.
There are three problems here.	Ho na le mathata a mararo mona.
Was it really you?	Na e ne e hlile e le uena?
This could not have happened again.	Sena se ka be se sa etsahala hape.
Forget about it all.	Lebala ka taba eo kaofela.
I just got that.	Ke sa tsoa fumana seo.
He must leave us.	O tlameha ho re tlohela.
I didn't want it.	Ke ne ke sa e batle.
Many children are still wearing these clothes.	Bana ba bangata ba ntse ba apara liaparo tsena.
These are some of my most difficult questions.	Tsena ke tse ling tsa lipotso tsa ka tse thata ka ho fetisisa.
The error does not appear.	Phoso ha e bonahale.
But you have to try.	Empa o lokela ho leka.
Thank you, very much !.	Kea leboha, haholo!.
I won't see you tonight.	Ha ke na ho o bona bosiung bona.
No one will notice.	Ha ho motho ea tla hlokomela.
I'm done and it's your turn to replace.	Ke qetile 'me ke nako ea hau ea ho nka sebaka.
They are looking for us.	Ba ntse ba re batla.
Just for your location.	Bakeng sa sebaka sa hau feela.
Therefore, they have no power over them.	Ka hona, ha ba na matla ho bona.
I look at it.	Kea e sheba.
I had a lot of things to work with.	Ke ne ke e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo ke lokelang ho sebetsa le tsona.
People always tell us.	Batho ba lula ba re bolella.
Have he or his parents ever tried to.	Na eena kapa batsoali ba hae ba kile ba leka ho.
He's really trying.	O hlile a leka.
It was fun to see it.	Ho ne ho le monate ho o bona.
In fact, children love to use them.	Ha e le hantle, bana ba rata ho li sebelisa.
It depends on what he wants.	E ea ka seo a se batlang.
This sounds like a good idea, but who's going to pay?	Sena se bonahala e le mohopolo o motle, empa ke mang ea tla lefa?
None of them thought of quitting.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a nahana ho tlohela.
I give you the opportunity to do so.	Ke u fa monyetla oa ho etsa joalo.
He said he was sorry.	O ile a re o masoabi.
We see them often.	Re li bona hangata.
I've seen something like it before.	Ke bone ntho e kang eona pele.
She is no longer afraid of him.	Ha a sa mo tšaba.
Don't just walk away.	O seke oa tsamaea feela.
You are trying to survive.	U leka ho phela.
They're going on, man.	Ba ntse ba tsoela pele, monna.
You need them more often than you think.	U li hloka hangata ho feta kamoo u ka nahanang.
Then just stop.	Joale ema feela.
However, I know one thing.	Leha ho le joalo, ke tseba ntho e le 'ngoe.
You do not have to believe anything.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u lumele letho.
I get a lot.	Ke fumana tse ngata.
Get them going.	Etsa hore ba tsamaee.
I, too, enjoyed this book very much.	Le ’na ke thabetse buka ena haholo.
You will do it with these.	U tla e etsa ka tsena.
The problem is, everyone had the same feelings.	Bothata ke hore, bohle ba bile le maikutlo a tšoanang.
But if he only knew.	Empa hoja a ne a tseba.
Maybe he agrees.	Mohlomong oa lumela.
I used to watch him every day.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ho mo shebella letsatsi le leng le le leng.
I couldn’t decide what it was.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho etsa qeto ea hore na ke eng.
And he still had his life.	Mme o ne a ntse a na le bophelo ba hae.
It should not come.	Ha ea lokela ho fihla.
I already have money.	Ke se ke na le chelete.
It defeated them all.	E ile ea ba hlola kaofela.
Then this can go to a man or a woman.	Joale sena se ka ea monna kapa mosali.
One more.	E 'ngoe hape.
He will do well.	O tla etsa hantle.
I am no better than anyone else.	Ha ke molemo ho feta mang kapa mang.
It's a very bad thing.	Ke ntho e mpe haholo.
The food was very good.	Lijo li ne li le ntle haholo.
Delicious coffee was strong.	Kofi e monate e ne e le matla.
She has been living alone for many years now.	O se a ntse a phela a le mong ka lilemo tse ngata joale.
Not for long.	Ha ho nako e telele.
Which is what happens here.	E leng sona se etsahalang mona.
That's how we did it.	Ke kamoo re entseng kateng.
It was a lot because we didn't make much money.	E ne e le ngata hobane re ne re sa fumane chelete e ngata.
I think you need some time alone.	Ke nahana hore u hloka nako e itseng u le mong.
Job status.	Boemo ba mosebetsi .
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha a etse joalo.
I can't stand looking at him.	Ha ke khone ho ema ho mo sheba.
He is still there.	O ntse a le teng.
It is the first day.	Ke letsatsi la pele.
They were beautiful enough to look at but one could be injured.	Ba ne ba le motle hoo ba neng ba ka shebella empa motho a ka tsoa kotsi.
That's one of them.	Ke e 'ngoe eo.
However, this is not the case this week.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo bekeng ena.
Our children are healthy.	Bana ba rona ba phela hantle.
Of course, you can't have one without the other.	Ha e le hantle, u ke ke ua ba le e 'ngoe ntle le e' ngoe.
In fact, he could not even speak to her.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a sa tsebe ho bua le eena.
To know this and to see that through it comes work.	Hore u tsebe taba ena 'me u bone hore ka eona ho tla le mosebetsi.
It would not take long even in my place.	E ne e ke ke ea nka nako e telele le sebakeng sa ka.
It could not survive.	E ne e ke ke ea phela.
You use it when you want it.	U e sebelisa ha u e batla.
Strong, e.	E matla, e.
She received a letter that made her cry.	O ile a fumana lengolo le ileng la mo lla.
But here we were.	Empa mona re ne re le teng.
We would definitely stay again.	Ka sebele re ne re tla lula hape.
So they did not, either.	Kahoo ha ba ka ba etsa joalo, le bona.
He will help us.	O tla re thusa.
There was someone at home.	Ho ne ho e-na le motho hae.
She was crying and asked him about it.	O ne a ntse a lla mme a mo botsa ka eona.
They want to sleep.	Ba batla ho robala.
Time is running out.	Nako e ya pele.
Maybe it was good.	Mohlomong e ne e le ntle.
He kept busy.	O ile a lula a phathahane.
We find this to be the case here.	Re fumana ho le joalo mona.
We need to see the Father.	Re hloka ho bona Ntate.
A week, maybe.	Beke, mohlomong.
They can't even say anything.	Ha ba khone le ho bua letho.
Writing.	Ho ngola.
Even now, though he was not looking, he knew exactly where he was.	Le hona joale, leha a sa sheba, o ne a tseba hantle moo a leng teng.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke tsebe hantle.
You can even just walk away.	U ka ba ua tsamaea feela.
And then we start to doubt a little bit.	Mme ebe re qala ho belaela hanyane.
You need time to think.	U hloka nako ea ho nahana.
Our telephone line also works.	Mohala oa rona oa mohala o sebetsa hape.
He was alone.	O ne a le mong.
I didn't see it either.	Le 'na ha kea e bona.
It must have gone.	E tlameha ebe e ile.
That was not my opinion.	Seo e ne e se maikutlo a ka.
He used to think that too.	Le eena o ne a tloaetse ho nahana joalo.
Not often.	Hangata ha ho joalo.
There is nothing we can do to help.	Ha ho letho leo re ka le etsang ho thusa.
Even if there was another way, we could not find it.	Leha ho ne ho ka ba le tsela e 'ngoe, re ne re ke ke ra e fumana.
There is nothing of days behind us.	Ha ho na letho la matsatsi ka mor'a rona.
Yes, they are.	E, li teng.
And you like to be caught.	'Me u rata ho tšoaroa.
I did not give him a chance.	Ha kea ka ka mo fa monyetla.
He had the power to do this.	O ne a e-na le matla a ho etsa sena.
Now, don't go anywhere.	Jwale, o seke wa ya kae kapa kae.
I found one.	Ke fumane e le 'ngoe.
I'm glad you don't understand what's going on.	Ke thabela hore ebe ha u utloisise se etsahalang.
Such a person.	Motho ya jwalo.
No, we tend to do many things without knowing why.	Che, re tloaetse ho etsa lintho tse ngata re sa tsebe lebaka.
He opened the door.	A bula lemati.
I hope you like it.	Kea tšepa le rata.
It is a matter of where you start.	Ke taba ea hore na u qala kae.
Human life is not good.	Bophelo ba motho ha bo na molemo.
He is stronger than you know.	O matla ho feta kamoo o tsebang.
This is a dangerous situation.	Bona ke boemo bo kotsi.
He may have been like that for hours.	E ka 'na eaba o ne a le joalo ka lihora tse ngata.
She says she loves her boy.	O re o rata moshanyana oa hae.
Obviously, this has not yet happened.	Ho hlakile hore sena ha se e-so be 'nete.
He has no idea how to do it.	Ho hang ha a tsebe hore na a ka e etsa joang.
I'm afraid of what might happen next, even if he is not.	Ke tšaba se ka ’nang sa etsahala ka mor’a moo, le haeba a se joalo.
Of course, they want to make money.	Ehlile, ba batla ho etsa chelete.
If you have not had it in a long time it is very good.	Haeba u ne u se na eona ka nako e telele e ntle haholo.
I just did it.	Ke e entse feela.
I was able to understand everything.	Ke ne ke khona ho utloisisa ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
Children learn to read easily.	Bana ba ithuta ho bala ha bonolo.
The important thing is when it happens.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke ha e etsahala.
People live a simple life.	Batho ba phela ka tsela e bonolo.
However, it did not last long.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ea ka ea nka nako e telele.
I lived by it.	Ke ne ke phela ka eona.
Then they came quickly and mightily.	Eaba ba tla kapele le ka matla.
That is very important to me.	Seo se bohlokoa haholo ho nna.
We may not catch them for three days.	Re ka 'na ra se ke ra ba tšoara ka matsatsi a mararo.
We will not fall !.	Re ke ke ra oa!.
Not sure if anything.	Ha u na bonnete ba hore na ho hong ho hong.
Because that's what he has to do.	Hobane ke seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
He needed water.	O ne a hloka metsi.
You do not have to tell anyone.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u bolelle mang kapa mang.
It does not matter.	Ha e bohlokoa.
I stand on my feet.	Ke ema ka maoto.
My wife does not know.	Mosali oa ka ha a tsebe.
See how many questions you get.	Sheba hore na u fumana lipotso tse kae hantle.
I was.	Ke ne ke bile.
Everyone loves her.	E mong le e mong oa mo rata.
You understand what a job is.	Ua utloisisa hore na mosebetsi ke eng.
I knew it all.	Ke ne ke tseba tsohle.
No food.	Ha ho lijo.
I don't know how they will be able to do that.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ba tla khona ho etsa joalo joang.
He refused and continued walking.	O ile a hana eaba o tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
He cared for them very much.	O ne a ba hlokomela haholo.
But live today.	Empa phela kajeno.
Now they do it all together.	Hona joale ba etsa tsohle hammoho.
Car, meet bike.	Koloi, kopana le baesekele.
I really like when they do it often.	Ke rata haholo ha ba e etsa hangata.
The same was true of their lives.	Ho ne ho le joalo le ka bophelo ba bona.
In fact, I consider some issues to be even more important.	Ha e le hantle ke nka litaba tse ling e le tsa bohlokoa haholoanyane.
But, now.	Empa, joale .
But we knew who knew.	Empa re ne re tseba hore na ke mang ea tsebang.
We'll see you next time.	Re tla u bona nakong e tlang.
He met us.	O kopane le rona.
I can't say which one.	Nke ke ka bolela hore na ke efe.
I don’t think we expected it to be so bad.	Ha ke nahane hore re ne re lebeletse hore e tla ba mpe hakaalo.
I can't do this alone.	Ha ke khone ho etsa sena ke le mong.
If they reach you, you will not survive.	Haeba ba u fihlela, u ke ke ua phela.
Finally, he spoke.	Qetellong, o ile a bua.
I think a lot of people should be like that, really.	Ke nahana hore batho ba bangata ba lokela ho ba joalo, ha e le hantle.
Finally, some good news.	Qetellong, litaba tse ling tse monate.
The baby was a boy, and things were going well.	Ngoana e ne e le moshanyana, ’me lintho li ne li tsamaea hantle.
In fact it does not exist at all.	Ha e le hantle ha e eo ho hang.
This is just the way it should be.	Sena se feela kamoo se lokelang ho ba kateng.
He had done it before and he could do it again.	O ne a kile a e etsa mme a ka e etsa hape.
One was real, as real as he was.	E mong e ne e le oa sebele, oa sebele joaloka eena.
I will come out well.	Ke tla tsoa hantle.
This is a very nice place.	Mona ke sebaka se setle haholo.
He did not ask if he was alone.	Ha aa ka a botsa hore na o ne a le mong.
I don't know if he will.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o tla etsa joalo.
I do that sometimes.	Ke etsa joalo ka linako tse ling.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha ho joalo.
You only get one.	U fumana e le 'ngoe feela.
However, he works hard.	Leha ho le joalo, o sebetsa ka thata.
But he certainly would not.	Empa ho hlakile hore o ne a ke ke a etsa joalo.
You will be doing a lot of things.	U tla be u ntse u etsa lintho tse ngata.
But she looked just like him.	Empa o ne a shebahala joalo ka eena.
However, you can check it out.	Leha ho le joalo, u ka e sheba.
Some of them did not know who he was.	Ba bang ba bona ba ne ba sa tsebe hore na ke mang.
Yes, it can go anywhere.	E, e ka ea kae kapa kae.
But it's hard for him to be with us.	Empa ho thata hore a be le rona.
Of course they are not.	Ehlile ha ba jwalo.
I want to make sure that the rest of us.	Ke batla ho etsa bonnete ba hore ba bang kaofela ba rona.
And his.	Le ea hae.
They give it to him.	Ba mo fa eona.
I'll see it.	Ke tla e bona.
And it never will be.	Mme ha ho sa tla ba jwalo.
We have everything we need right here.	Re na le tsohle tseo re li hlokang hona mona.
We both wanted to go.	Ka bobeli re ne re batla ho tsamaea.
This is very clear.	Sena se hlakile haholo.
And your husband.	Le monna oa hao.
I, too, have thought about this before.	Le 'na, ke kile ka nahana ka sena pele.
It looks very good.	E shebahala hantle haholo.
But you will probably do so.	Empa mohlomong u tla etsa joalo.
But now she knows him.	Empa joale a mo tseba.
Perhaps the most important time was in law school.	Mohlomong nako ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa e ne e le sekolong sa molao.
He will not pass.	Ha a na ho feta.
And he will always be there.	Mme o tla dula a le teng.
It is very powerful.	E matla haholo.
It was too old.	E ne e le khale haholo.
The place is easier than it is now.	Sebaka se bonolo ho feta hona joale.
We need to see things as they really are.	Re hloka ho bona lintho kamoo li tla shebahala kateng.
He does this.	O etsa sena.
He tried it again.	A e leka hape.
Too late to sleep.	Ho robala morao haholo.
I think you saw the first one.	Ke nahana hore u bone ea pele.
Some are good, some are not.	Tse ling li ntle, tse ling ha li joalo.
He saw something.	O bone ho hong.
No man was glad to see her.	Ho ne ho se monna ea neng a thabela ho mo bona.
Either way, they were gone now.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe, ba ne ba ile joale.
My first job was in an area with a lot of books.	Mosebetsi oa ka oa pele e ne e le sebakeng se nang le libuka tse ngata.
But in this way.	Empa ka tsela ena.
The truth is not what you want it to be.	'Nete hase kamoo u batlang hore e be kateng.
I did not hear you coming, either.	Ha kea u utloa u tla, le.
This cannot be true.	Sena e ka se be 'nete.
However, he would not have known much about it.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a ka be a sa tsebe hakaalo ka eona.
This is my chance.	Ona ke monyetla oa ka.
Instead, he said.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a re.
I think it was just me.	Ke nahana hore e ne e le nna feela.
He stood at the end.	A ema qetellong.
I could speak.	Ke ne ke khona ho bua.
They have never done that.	Ha ba eso etse seo.
You can see some of the ideas here.	U ka bona tse ling tsa maikutlo mona.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha e na phoso kapa eng kapa eng.
Keep up the good work.	Tsoela pele ka mosebetsi o motle.
There was something wrong with what had happened.	Ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ho phoso ka se etsahetseng.
He was just a child.	E ne e le ngoana feela.
Just say it with conviction.	E bue feela ka matla.
She had never told him the truth about what had happened.	Ho ne ho se mohla a kileng a mo bolella 'nete ea se etsahetseng.
First, you need to know how to get there.	Pele, u lokela ho tseba tsela ea ho fihla moo.
Your mind may be skeptical.	Kelello ya hao e ka nna ya belaela.
He would just have to understand.	O ne a tla tlameha feela ho utloisisa.
They have been there for the past thirty years.	Ba bile le lilemo tse mashome a mararo tse fetileng.
A group of friends sat down to have dinner.	Sehlopha sa metsoalle se ile sa lula fatše ho ja lijo tsa mantsiboea.
So he said.	Kahoo a re.
He just sat there and looked around.	A dula feela mme a sheba sebakeng.
Maybe it was him.	Mohlomong e ne e le eena.
He was arrested by the local police.	O ile a tšoaroa ke mapolesa a moo.
It's your opinion.	Ke maikutlo a hau.
At some point you want to do something.	Ka nako e itseng u batla ho etsa ntho e 'ngoe.
Of course, this is not the only way.	Ehlile, ena ha se eona feela tsela.
I think he meant he was not.	Ke nahana hore o ne a bolela hore ha a joalo.
Have a good time.	Eba le nako e monate.
And so it is.	Mme ho jwalo.
That's just true of it.	Ke 'nete feela ka eona.
I tried to catch up.	Ke ile ka leka ho tšoara.
It was only necessary to know if it would be better over time.	Ho ne ho hlokahala feela ho tseba hore na ho tla ba molemo ha nako e ntse e ea.
I can still love them as a family.	Ke ntse ke khona ho ba rata joaloka lelapa.
Too much, too much.	E ngata haholo, e ngata haholo.
Use something like this instead.	Sebelisa ntho e kang ena ho e-na le hoo.
But they did not know enough.	Empa ba ne ba sa tsebe ho lekana.
We were afraid to go out at night.	Re ne re tšaba ho tsoa bosiu.
We may not think about it, but we do.	Re ka 'na ra se ke ra nahana ka eona, empa rea ​​e etsa.
I don't want him either.	Le nna ha ke mo batle.
Nothing is easier.	Ha ho letho le bonolo.
They just happen.	Li etsahala feela.
I have never felt that way until now.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke ikutloa ka tsela eo ho fihlela joale.
It gave us something to talk about.	E ile ea re fa seo re ka buang ka sona.
He had to look.	O ne a lokela ho sheba.
It's always been that way, and it probably will always be.	Ho bile jwalo kamehla, mme mohlomong ho tla dula ho le jwalo.
This job is better.	Mosebetsi ona o betere.
I enjoy it now.	Kea e thabela hona joale.
I love this book.	Ke rata buka ena.
I will never say 'maybe'.	Ha ke sa tla re 'mohlomong'.
Not too bad.	Ha ho e mpe haholo.
Everyone gets it in the end.	E mong le e mong oa e fumana qetellong.
And there are many of them.	Mme ho na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
I spent a day at work.	Ke ile ka qeta letsatsi mosebetsing.
This is not an easy task.	Sena ha se mosebetsi o bonolo.
Then by car.	Joale ka koloi.
If he could do that, he would be working.	Haeba a ne a ka etsa joalo, o ne a tla be a sebetsa.
We had not talked about this for years.	E ne e se e le lilemo tse ngata re sa bue ka taba ena.
I opened it and let him walk on it.	Ke ile ka bula 'me ka mo tlohela hore a tsamaee ho eona.
The door slammed as he opened it.	Lemati la lla ha a le bula.
His hands were stiff.	Matsoho a hae a ne a le thata.
This is very bad.	Sena se mpe haholo.
Look back at them, but say nothing.	Sheba morao ho bona, empa o seke wa bua letho.
It was fun.	E ne e le monate.
Hear if you can.	Utloa ha u ka khona.
It was this.	E ne e le sena.
You may want to try my method.	U ka 'na ua batla ho leka mokhoa oa ka.
I have nothing.	ha ke sa le letho.
I did a good job.	Ke entse mosebetsi o motle.
Also, the best.	Hape, molemo ka ho fetisisa.
That's it.	Ke hona moo.
However, the good news is that it is not necessary.	Leha ho le joalo, litaba tse monate ke hore ha ho hlokahale.
Because it was a wonderful day.	Hobane e ne e le letsatsi le monate.
I'm not sure what kind of thing this is.	Ha ke tsebe hantle ntho ea mofuta ona.
I cried in front.	Ke ile ka lla ka pele.
It was nothing of the sort.	E ne e se letho la mofuta oo.
No one there ever forgot it.	Ha ho motho ea neng a le moo ea kileng a e lebala.
However, this is no longer the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se sa le joalo.
Of course, they were not.	Ha e le hantle, ba ne ba se joalo.
They had to get out.	Ba ne ba tlameha ho tsoa.
I just wanted to eat.	Ke ne ke batla ho ja feela.
I like the idea.	Ke rata mohopolo.
Both of us.	Ka bobeli ba rona.
I would not know.	Ke ne nke ke ka tseba.
Thanks only for your suggestion.	Ke leboha feela ka tlhahiso ea hau.
I wanted to finish this book in a week.	Ke ne ke batla ho qeta buka ena ka mor'a beke.
If you start with something bad, no one will like it.	Haeba u qala ka ntho e mpe, ha ho motho ea tla e rata.
The method works very well!	Mokhoa o sebetsa hantle haholo!
He stood behind her.	O ile a ema ka mor'a hae.
I do not like to sleep.	Ha ke rate le ho robala.
I'm not sure that could have happened.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore seo se ne se ka etsahala.
I know what you are going to say.	Ke tseba seo o tlang ho se bua.
However, you may wonder if there is more.	Leha ho le joalo, u ka 'na ua ipotsa hore na ho na le ho hong hape.
These are not my clothes.	Tsena ha se liaparo tsa ka.
However, I had told him many things.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke mo boleletse lintho tse ngata.
This made it real for all of us.	Sena se ile sa etsa hore e be oa sebele ho rōna kaofela.
And it works for me.	Mme e sebetsa ho nna.
Our school is not as good as our school.	Sekolo sa rona ha se hantle joalo ka sekolo sa rona.
None of them seemed to be real.	Ha ho le e ’ngoe ea tsona e neng e bonahala e le ea sebele.
He was very bad.	O ne a le mpe haholo.
I had to say that.	Ke ne ke lokela ho bolela seo.
I knew what he was going to do.	Ke ne ke tseba seo a tla se etsa.
Don't stop at what he does.	U se ke ua ema ho seo a se etsang.
It works well.	E sebetsa hantle.
I think there is a better way to work with people.	Ke nahana hore ho na le tsela e betere ea ho sebetsa le batho.
I passed him.	Ke ile ka mo feta.
But no child.	Empa ha ho ngoana.
We both understood each other.	Ka bobeli re ne re utloisisa tse ling.
We certainly are.	Ruri re joalo.
And there were many.	Mme ba ne ba le bangata.
But it was definitely time to move on.	Empa ka sebele e ne e le nako ea ho tsoela pele.
They all need that.	Kaofela ba hloka seo.
Except for me.	Ntle le nna.
I was just beginning to think about that.	Ke ne ke qala ho nahana ka seo.
He could have been here.	A ka be a bile mona.
It was the same with my father.	Ho bile joalo le ka ntate.
That would be a terrible thing.	Seo e ne e tla ba ntho e mpe ruri.
We need your help.	Re kopa thuso ea hau.
Something to give, and to give quickly.	Ho hong ho tlameha ho fana, le ho fana kapele.
You have to start with the same place with your parents.	U tlameha ho qala sebakeng se le seng le batsoali ba hau.
He had no way of knowing how long he had been here.	O ne a se na mokhoa oa ho tseba hore na o bile mona nako e kae.
It looks bad, and it is bad.	E shebahala e le mpe, hape e mpe.
You have a big job ahead of you.	O na le mosebetsi o moholo ka pele ho wena.
It did not take long.	Ha ea ka ea nka nako e telele ho feta.
This car is relatively new.	Koloi ena e batla e le ncha.
I just wanted to pass.	Ke ne ke batla ho feta feela.
If it were easy, everyone would do it.	Haeba ho ne ho le bonolo, bohle ba ka be ba e etsa.
Do not go.	U se ke ua tsamaea.
He would get that soon.	O ne a tla fumana seo haufinyane.
He wanted what he wanted.	O ne a batla seo a se batlang.
Then father.	Joale ntate .
Love it, love it, love it.	E rate, e rate, e rate.
But that should happen soon.	Empa seo se lokela ho etsahala haufinyane.
If they do not want my money, they will not get it.	Haeba ba sa batle chelete ea ka, ba ke ke ba e fumana.
You are not friends.	Ha le metsoalle.
Let him see.	A ke a bone.
Of course, everything can be fine.	Ehlile, ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ka ba hantle.
And it was a wonderful feeling.	Mme e ne e le maikutlo a monate.
Careful planning and careful planning are essential.	Ho rera esale pele le ka hloko ke ntho ea bohlokoa.
Now, he knew he would have to.	Jwale, o ne a tseba hore o tla lokela.
You made it better.	U entse hore e be betere.
She is delicious.	O monate.
I will be visiting my family next week.	Ke tla be ke etela lelapa la ka bekeng e tlang.
This seems a little helpful.	Sena se bonahala se thusa hanyane.
Nothing worse could have happened.	Ha ho ntho e mpe le ho feta e neng e ka etsahala.
I love you and enjoy being with you so much.	Kea u rata 'me ke thabela ho ba le uena haholo.
I say if you need that time, take it.	Ke re ha o hloka nako eo, e nke.
You love your job.	U rata mosebetsi oa hau.
The doctor left.	Ngaka e ile ea tsamaea.
But there is a way out.	Empa ho na le tsela ea ho tsoa.
It's fun and weird.	Ke ntho e monate le e makatsang.
We see it all.	Re bona tsohle.
I called it.	Ke ile ka e letsa.
They did not move forward.	Ha baa tsoela pele.
Maybe that house really isn't that important.	Mohlomong ntlo eo ehlile ha e bohlokoa hakaalo.
This is an amazing book.	Ena ke buka e makatsang.
But then you can enjoy the day.	Empa joale u ka thabela letsatsi.
It seemed too old.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ke khale haholo.
But one thing remains clear.	Empa ntho e le 'ngoe e ntse e hlakile.
I do not know if that will be the case.	Ha ke tsebe haeba ho tla ba joalo.
Her beautiful boy was still alive.	Moshanyana wa hae e motle o ne a ntse a phela.
He did not like my family.	O ne a sa rate lelapa la ka.
But the reason for this is obvious.	Empa lebaka la sena le hlakile.
It is important to understand this.	Ho bohlokoa ho utloisisa sena.
It was a strange feeling.	E ne e le maikutlo a makatsang.
Dad just loves to talk.	Ntate o rata ho bua feela.
Or it may not happen at all.	Kapa e ka 'na ea se ke ea etsahala ho hang.
I get it, too.	Ke a e fumana, le nna.
We did not know where he came from.	Ha rea ​​ka ra tseba hore na o tsoa hokae.
You just want people to see it.	U batla feela hore batho ba e bone.
He tried to see.	A leka ho bona.
I did not know where to go now.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke ee hokae hona joale.
His life was hard.	Bophelo ba hae e ne e le bo thata.
He said he had no money.	O ile a re ha a na chelete.
I can't go home.	Ha ke khone ho khutlela hae.
I have some of his books.	Ke na le tse ling tsa libuka tsa hae.
You know my wife.	U tseba mosali oa ka.
I hope you have a good time.	Ke tšepa u tla ba le nako e monate.
Other things.	Lintho tse ling.
I can go.	Nka tsamaea.
And they were not children, any of these people.	Mme e ne e se bana, leha e le ofe wa batho bana.
I can wait and see how it goes.	Nka ema ke bone hore na ho ea joang.
I studied hard.	Ke ile ka ithuta ka thata.
Lots of people.	Batho ba bangata.
He stopped and looked at it.	A ema mme a e sheba.
It will be better.	Ho tla ba molemo.
I really enjoy that work.	Ke thabela mosebetsi oo haholo.
That way they will try to understand the problems.	Ka tsela eo ba tla leka ho utloisisa mathata.
He stopped as soon as he entered the room.	A ema hang ha a kena ka phaposing.
Well done, you.	O entse hantle, wena.
I think it looks really good.	Ke nahana hore e shebahala e le ntle haholo.
However, it was more fun.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le monate ho feta.
That is the life we ​​must take.	Ke bophelo boo re lokelang ho bo nka.
But this is happening.	Empa sena sea etsahala.
I like it very much.	Ke rata haholo.
And if someone comments on your situation, comment again.	'Me haeba motho e mong a fana ka maikutlo ka boemo ba hau, fana ka maikutlo hape.
That's exactly what you do.	Ke seo o se etsang hantle.
That is what we need to talk about.	Ke seo re lokelang ho bua ka sona.
I always have.	Ke na le kamehla.
They went out and did things.	Ba ile ba tsoa 'me ba etsa lintho.
He enjoyed watching.	O ne a thabela ho sheba.
Of course, we too could learn nothing from it.	Ke ’nete hore le rōna re ne re ke ke ra ithuta letho ho eona.
It seems hard to find such things.	Ho bonahala ho le thata ho fumana lintho tse joalo.
Because we have nothing but him.	Hobane ha re na letho ntle le eena.
But it does not have to be.	Empa ha ho hlokahale hore ho be joalo.
She is still very happy.	O ntse a thabile haholo.
This can be dangerous.	Sena se ka ba kotsi.
No, we cannot.	Che, re ke ke ra etsa joalo.
They were powerless, and they were useless.	Li ne li se na matla, 'me li se na thuso.
I don't care.	Ha ke na taba.
We need to meet if we want to live.	Re hloka ho kopana haeba re batla ho phela.
He likes that.	O rata seo.
Both were just children.	Ka bobeli e ne e le bana feela.
He would do it.	O ne a tla e etsa.
He would never forget it.	O ne a ke ke a e lebala le ka mohla.
You'll know when you're done.	O tla tseba ha o qetile.
I felt better after that.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke le betere ka mor'a moo.
It just seemed.	Ho ne ho bonahala feela .
Maria visited him every day.	Maria o ne a mo etela letsatsi le leng le le leng.
They tried and tried.	Ba ile ba leka le ho leka.
Which we were trying to get into.	Eo re neng re leka ho kena ho eona.
However, not everything worked.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ileng ea sebetsa.
As never before.	Joalo ka ha ho mohla ho lekaneng.
We were beautiful.	Re ne re le batle.
And then he would fix them.	'Me joale o ne a tla li lokisa.
In fact, he is doing just that.	Ha e le hantle, o ntse a etsa joalo.
Nothing was visible.	Ho ne ho se letho le neng le bonahala.
I like my food to be simple often.	Ke rata hore lijo tsa ka li be bonolo hangata.
They need you to be strong for the important work you are doing.	Ba hloka hore u be matla bakeng sa mosebetsi oa bohlokoa oo u o etsang.
Probably nothing here.	Mohlomong ha ho letho mona.
It's nothing.	Ha se letho.
He believed that there was more.	O ne a lumela hore ho na le ho feta.
He was our father.	E ne e le ntate oa rōna.
She does not mind.	Ha a tsotelle.
None of it was really untrue, mental.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea eona e neng e hlile e se 'nete, kelello.
That's the problem, that's it.	Ke bothata, eo.
So, we don't think about that.	Kahoo, ha re nahane ka taba e joalo.
It has to keep things fresh in some way.	E tlameha ho boloka lintho li le ncha ka tsela e itseng.
He did well.	O entse hantle.
So this food item must be important.	Kahoo ntho ena ea lijo e tlameha ho ba ea bohlokoa.
I did not find it.	Ha kea e fumana.
You can say what you say, but you are what you are.	O ka bua seo o se buang, empa o seo o leng sona.
No, not at all, though.	Che, ha ho joalo, leha ho le joalo.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang ka sena.
No one spoke.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a bua.
I need to go back to school.	Ke hloka ho khutlela sekolong.
It's just fine for tonight.	Ke hantle feela bakeng sa bosiung bona.
Sometimes, life is good.	Ka linako tse ling, bophelo bo monate.
This is what the people were talking about.	Sena ke seo batho ba neng ba bua ka sona.
Hard place.	Sebaka se thata.
But often only for the first time.	Empa hangata feela ka lekhetlo la pele.
If only they could see that there was nothing wrong with it.	Hoja ba ne ba ka bona hore ha ho letho la ho qetela ho eona.
He just wanted to talk, and we did.	O ne a batla ho bua feela, mme re ile ra etsa jwalo.
I have to play.	Ke tlameha ho bapala.
I do them all the time.	Ke li etsa ka linako tsohle.
Be the first.	Eba pele.
But they are good.	Empa ba molemo.
He started writing.	O ile a qala ho ngola.
Every day was a problem.	Letsatsi le leng le le leng e ne e le bothata.
That is why we need it.	Ke ka hona re o hlokang.
But, here we are.	Empa, ke rona bana.
He understood, of course.	O ne a utloisisa, ehlile.
Well, he is better than me.	Hantle, eena ho mpheta.
He had once asked himself the same question.	O ne a kile a ipotsa eona potso eo.
His family is one of them.	Lelapa la hae ke e 'ngoe ea tsona.
he thought.	a nahana.
In fact, they already have it.	Ha e le hantle, ba se ba ntse ba e-na le eona.
It works well.	E sebetsa hantle.
Enjoy your life with your wife and children.	Thabela bophelo ba hau le mosali oa hau le bana.
There were people in need.	Ho ne ho e-na le batho ba hlokang.
He has an amazingly good idea.	O na le mohopolo o motle ka tsela e makatsang.
He had some problems when he started.	O ne a e-na le mathata a itseng ha a qala.
We are all one family.	Kaofela re lelapa le le leng.
But he had to do what he had.	Empa o ne a tlameha ho etsa seo a neng a na le sona.
We ask what we have done wrong.	Re botsa hore na re entse phoso efe.
It would be nice once the night.	E ne e tla ba ntle hang bosiu.
Mine will never look like that.	Ea ka e ke ke ea shebahala joalo.
Probably even worse.	Mohlomong le tse mpe haholo.
He wants her to see.	O batla hore a bone.
Please go somewhere else.	Ke kopa u ee sebakeng se seng.
He just needs help.	O mpa a hloka thuso.
The girl thought he was pretty.	Ngoanana eo o ne a nahana hore o motle.
They are united.	Li kopane.
If he was eating now.	Hoja o ne a ja jwale.
Being an adult standing is very difficult.	Ho ba moholo ho ema ho thata haholo.
You know them by heart, yes.	U li tseba ka hlooho, e.
We better go.	Ho molemo hore re tsamaee.
No one else will help you.	Ha ho motho e mong ea tla u thusa.
That they were never important.	Hore ha ho mohla ba kileng ba ba bohlokoa.
They read a lot but write a little.	Ba bala haholo empa ba ngola hanyane.
Real.	Ea sebele.
We have to get over it.	Re tlameha ho e feta.
But there was nothing he could do.	Empa ho ne ho se seo a ka se etsang.
I feel happy.	Ke ikutloa ke thabile.
You do not understand any of this.	Ha o utloisise letho la sena.
Leave it to me.	Tlohela ho 'na.
I feel very sorry for it.	Ke utloa bohloko haholo ka eona.
To pay for it.	Ho o lefa.
There he stayed for hours at a time.	Ha a le moo o ne a lula lihora tse ngata ka nako.
A good doctor is good for everyone.	Ngaka e molemo e molemo ho batho bohle.
That is the way of our people.	Ke tsela ea batho ba rona.
We say nothing.	Ha re bue letho.
She looked at him, not understanding.	A mo sheba, a sa utloisise.
We do not need it now.	Ha re e hloke hona joale.
That means everything.	Seo se bolela tsohle.
No one had it.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a e-na le eona.
They don't really think about them.	Ha ba hlile ha ba nahane ka bona.
I'd like to read something.	Ke kopa ho bala ho hong.
Of course he is a very big boy !.	Ehlile ke moshanyana e moholo haholo!.
I should not say it.	Ha ke a lokela ho e bua.
That was not the case before.	Seo se ne se le sieo pele.
Anyone can enter.	Mang kapa mang a ka kena.
It really does now.	Ehlile e etsa hona jwale.
She is very sweet.	O monate haholo.
You can stay with us tonight.	O ka dula le rona bosiung bona.
Forget tomorrow.	Lebala ka hosane.
I go to work every day.	Ke ea mosebetsing letsatsi le letsatsi.
Yet why there should be nothing left is hard to say.	Leha ho le joalo ke hobane'ng ha ho sa lokela ho ba le letho ho thata ho bua.
It was just as he had expected.	E ne e le kamoo a neng a lebeletse kateng.
He was a man who loved space.	E ne e le monna ya ratang sebaka.
And you enjoy it.	'Me ua e thabela.
This may take some time.	Sena se ka nka nako.
And let us not forget the hard work they did.	Hape, re se ke ra lebala mosebetsi o boima oo ba o entseng.
We would love to talk to you.	Ka sebele re ka thabela ho bua le uena.
Without them you are useless.	Ntle ho tsona ha u na thuso.
His subject has been his life.	Taba ea hae e bile bophelo ba hae.
It was true though.	E ne e le 'nete leha ho le joalo.
If you will be with me then so be it.	Haeba u tla ba le 'na ho joalo.
Their lives will not be in danger.	Bophelo ba bona bo ke ke ba ba kotsing.
That's what he does here.	Ke seo a se etsang mona.
We are waiting.	Re lebeletse.
So you know, go ahead.	Kahoo ua tseba, tsoela pele.
He doesn’t even care if it’s real food or not.	Ha a tsotelle le hore na ke lijo tsa sebele kapa che.
You will never want to buy there again.	Ha o sa tla hlola o batla ho reka moo hape.
Do what he says.	Etsa seo a se buang.
They give time to play.	Ba fana ka nako ea ho bapala.
It was so.	Ho bile joalo.
Do not talk about the past.	Se ke oa bua ka lintho tse fetileng.
One of them is driving a car.	E mong oa bona o khanna koloi.
I'm waiting for the call.	Ke emetse mohala.
It was just right.	E ne e lekana hantle.
Maybe even your life.	Mohlomong le bophelo ba hau.
That was a daunting task.	Oo e ne e le mosebetsi o boima haholo.
All his life.	Bophelo bohle ba hae.
It can be anyone.	E ka ba mang kapa mang.
He just slept there.	O ile a robala feela moo.
The problem is not being able to do it.	Bothata ke ho se khone ho e etsa.
For hours and hours.	Ka lihora le lihora.
Talk to me, like people.	Bua le 'na, joaloka batho.
All these weird foods.	Lijo tsena tsohle tse makatsang.
You would not have known that then.	O ka be o sa tseba seo ka nako eo.
I did not want to hear it again.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho e utloa hape.
I can give it to your wife, but.	Nka fa mosali oa hau, empa.
No, no.	Che, che.
It is not their decision.	Ha se qeto ea bona.
Maybe you can try it.	Mohlomong u ka e leka.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Ho ne ho se phoso ka seo.
I almost can't handle it.	Ke batla ke sa khone ho e tšoara.
They go back.	Ba khutlela morao.
Thank you for taking my question.	Kea leboha ha u nkile potso ea ka.
They passed quickly.	Ba ile ba feta kapele.
The car was empty.	Koloi e ne e se na motho.
We can't stand it.	Re sitoa ho ema.
The news was bad.	Litaba li ne li le mpe.
This also means a very high level of energy.	Sena le sona se bolela matla a phahameng haholo a matla.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
Maybe he has nothing.	Mohlomong ha a na letho.
You can try to convince others.	U ka leka ho kholisa batho ba bang.
We will do nothing.	Ha re na ho etsa letho.
I loved being away from work.	Ke ne ke rata ho se be mosebetsing.
I want more.	Ke batla ho feta.
Also, there is another.	Hape, ho na le e 'ngoe.
There was a water issue.	Ho ne ho e-na le taba ea metsi.
He knew them well.	O ne a ba tseba hantle.
It will be fun.	Ho tla ba monate.
They even did it in the backyard.	Ba ne ba bile ba e etsa ka mor'a ntlo.
I can only imagine your thoughts.	Ke khona ho nahana feela ka maikutlo a hau.
It would be better to end this.	Ho ka ba molemo ho qeta sena.
I have to give it to Mom.	Ke tlameha ho e fa 'Mè.
I can't go back.	Ha ke khone ho khutlela morao.
And after that we did not enjoy anything.	Mme ka mora moo ha re a ka ra thabela letho.
He goes in there.	O kena moo.
Of course he is.	Ehlile o teng.
He knows what he is doing.	O tseba seo a se etsang.
Because he needed to do so.	Hobane o ne a hloka ho etsa joalo.
She tried not to look at him.	A leka hore a se ke a mo sheba.
We see problems but see nothing.	Re bona mathata empa ha re bone letho le leng.
Moreover it is not a difficult task.	Ho feta moo ha se mosebetsi o boima.
We want to be sure.	Re batla ho ba le bonnete.
My mother did as she pleased.	’Mè o ile a etsa kamoo a ratang kateng.
I know this, you know this.	Ke tseba sena, le tseba sena.
He would come in here.	O ne a tla kena mona.
What are we doing?	Re ntse re etsa'ng?
It was clear that something was wrong.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
And now me.	Mme jwale nna.
He! ' 	Eena!'
Then they want a second house.	Joale ba batla ntlo ea bobeli.
It works, and it works well.	E ea sebetsa, 'me e sebetsa hantle.
This does the job.	Sena se etsa mosebetsi.
She had never tried to be with another man.	O ne a eso ka a leka ho ba le monna e mong.
The children were very happy.	Bana ba ne ba thabile haholo.
So will I.	Le nna ke tla be ke le jwalo.
You are not me.	Ha u 'na.
I can use the party.	Nka sebelisa mokete.
Both will work.	Ka bobeli li tla sebetsa.
Even then he was looking for her.	Le ka nako eo o ne a mo batla.
She decided to have one child.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho ba le ngoana a le mong.
Making them go would be enough.	Ho etsa hore ba tsamaee ho ne ho tla lekana.
There was so much to learn about man.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo motho a neng a ka ithuta tsona ka motho.
We found that.	Re ile ra fumana seo.
He seemed out of place.	O ne a bonahala a se sebakeng.
The new one is doing things like this now.	E ncha e etsa lintho tse kang tsena hona joale.
He might let her sleep, she thought.	A ka 'na a mo lumella ho robala, a nahana.
Some you will like.	Tse ling u tla li rata.
A day ahead of time.	Letsatsi pele ho nako.
It's just dinner.	Ke lijo tsa mantsiboea feela.
I enjoy that.	Ke thabela seo.
I offer a living space.	Ke fana ka sebaka sa bophelo .
It's really nice to see you here again.	Ruri ho monate ho o bona mona hape.
I know this will work even better.	Kea tseba hore sena se tla sebetsa hantle le ho feta.
I just decided.	Ke sa tsoa etsa qeto.
He could sleep in the morning if he wanted to.	O ne a ka robala hoseng ha a rata.
Understand this process.	Utloisisa mokhoa ona.
He fell asleep.	A robala.
I do not know you either.	Le nna ha ke o tsebe.
John is my bike.	John ke baesekele ea ka.
He once told me he loved to swim.	Ka lekhetlo le leng o ile a mpolella hore o rata ho sesa.
I knew the feelings.	Ke ne ke tseba maikutlo.
Then he understood.	Eaba oa utloisisa.
The car went well.	Koloi e ile ea tsamaea hantle.
I am not a doctor.	Ha ke ngaka.
This had to be important, because not everyone had them.	Sena se ne se lokela ho ba sa bohlokoa, hobane hase bohle ba neng ba e-na le tsona.
Until we meet again.	Ho fihlela re kopana hape.
You too have made something to drink.	Le uena u entse ntho ea ho noa.
I couldn’t go through it at the time.	Ke ne nke ke ka khona ho feta ka eona ka nako eo.
However, it was not his way.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se tsela ea hae.
And be careful not to make a mistake.	Mme hlokomela hore o seke wa etsa phoso.
If there is something there, we will find it.	Haeba ho na le ho hong moo, re tla e fumana.
It just doesn't exist.	Ha e eo feela.
He loved her then.	O ne a mo rata ka nako eo.
It is the same again.	Ho joalo hape.
Then they can have a chance.	Joale ba ka ba le monyetla.
We will go somewhere.	Re tla ea sebakeng se seng.
We usually do something simple.	Hangata re etsa ntho e bonolo.
It's a good thing, good to be here.	Ke ntho e ntle, e ntle hore ebe o teng mona.
You could see what was happening.	U ne u ka bona se etsahalang.
We must move on.	Re tlameha ho tsoela pele.
Every child is ours.	Ngoana e mong le e mong ke oa rona.
Then we just stood there.	Eaba re ema moo feela.
Some are not so.	Ba bang ha ba joalo haholo.
So be careful.	Kahoo hlokomela.
I know where he went.	Ke tseba moo a ileng teng.
It was as if he could see in me.	E ne eka o bona ka ho 'na.
This should not have worked.	Sena se ne se sa lokela ho sebetsa.
That's just fine.	Ke hantle feela.
They were not at all present.	Ho hang li ne li le sieo.
The situation was the same.	Boemo e ne e le bona.
It is usually at night.	Hangata ke bosiu.
None of us really expected to play.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea neng a hlile a lebeletse ho bapala.
He was hurt.	O ne a utloile bohloko.
You have to work in a simple way.	U tlameha ho sebetsa ka tsela e bonolo.
Probably.	Mohlomong .
Find him.	Batla eena.
And you will use your mind to try new things.	'Me u tla sebelisa kelello ea hao ka ho leka lintho tse ncha.
We will be back home soon.	Re tla khutlela hae haufinyane.
Maybe I'm writing.	Mohlomong kea ngola.
Something like that.	Ntho e kang eo.
Nobody wanted to talk to me.	Ho ne ho se motho ya batlang ho bua le nna.
And they did so.	Mme ba etsa jwalo.
How do you feel?	U ikutloa joang?
I can't believe it.	Ha ke khone ho lumela.
Every car has one like this.	Koloi e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e na le e tšoanang le ena.
This school loves him very much.	Sekolo sena se mo rata haholo.
He wants to keep it that way.	O batla ho e boloka e le joalo.
They have never left.	Ha ba eso tsamaee.
It was usually not important.	Hangata e ne e se ea bohlokoa.
They talked about this situation for a long time.	Ba ile ba bua ka boemo bona ka nako e telele.
It was their job.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa bona.
We have to live without that.	Re lokela ho phela ntle le seo.
Very, very well.	Haholo, hantle haholo.
Get that idea.	Fumana mohopolo oo.
He knew where he was.	O ne a tseba moo a leng teng.
I sit down every day and write.	Ke lula fatše letsatsi le leng le le leng ebe ke ngola.
She looks at him	O a mo sheba
That's all, but too many.	Ke tseo kaofela, empa tse ngata haholo.
He could not give them any more.	O ne a sa khone ho ba fa tse ling hape.
He did well.	O entse hantle.
But it is very difficult to find it.	Empa ho thata haholo ho e fumana.
I would like to acknowledge that my mother is not.	Ke kopa ho lumela hore 'm'e ha a joalo.
My whole family.	Lelapa la ka kaofela.
User friendly.	Ho bonolo ho e sebelisa.
His wife was ashamed of them both.	Mosali oa hae o ne a le lihlong ho bona ka bobeli.
If you have new ones, they are great.	Haeba u na le tse ncha, li ntle.
I wondered about others.	Ke ne ke ipotsa ka ba bang.
We will never know, and it does not matter.	Re ke ke ra tseba, 'me ha ho na taba.
Take my money.	Nka chelete ea ka.
But we will find a way.	Empa re tla fumana tsela.
If he even went anywhere.	Haeba a bile a ile kae kapa kae.
The girl looked at him.	Ngoanana a mo shebella.
First, they have not done anything.	Pele, ha ba e-s'o etse letho.
I know there is a lot to learn.	Kea tseba hore ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo ba lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
Now more than ever.	Hona joale ho feta leha e le neng pele.
Yes, that is what he wanted.	Ee, ke sona seo a neng a se batla.
It must have been morning.	E tlameha ebe e ne e le hoseng.
And thank you again.	Mme kea leboha hape.
Imagine what it would have been like if he had been present.	Nahana hore na ho ka ba joang, hoja a ne a le teng joale.
It was not the place you wanted to be.	E ne e se sebaka seo u neng u batla ho ba ho sona.
They will both do a good job.	Ka bobeli ba tla etsa mosebetsi o motle.
It could have allowed the night to come, or to continue in the background.	E ka be e ile ea lumella bosiu boo ho tla, kapa ho tsoela pele ka morao.
Whatever he does.	Eng kapa eng eo a e etsang.
This process was very time consuming.	Mokhoa ona o ne o ja nako haholo.
I have to tell them.	Ke tlameha ho ba bolella.
As with the rest of the house, the room has seen better days.	Joalo ka ntlo eohle, kamore e bone matsatsi a betere.
This is the first in the class.	Ena ke ea pele sehlopheng.
It has to understand.	E lokela ho utloisisa.
I'm not sure he can take it.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore a ka e nka.
Sometimes when you don't think he can, he does.	Ka linako tse ling ha u sa nahane hore a ka khona, oa etsa joalo.
We give them whatever they want.	Re ba fa eng kapa eng eo ba e batlang.
One more thing.	Ntho e 'ngoe hape.
They saw and said nothing.	Ba ile ba bona mme ba bua letho.
I tell you what we will do.	Ke le bolella seo re tla se etsa.
They are both good.	Li ntle ka bobeli.
That's how you could get in.	Ke ka moo o neng o ka kena.
She looked so beautiful.	O ne a shebahala a le motle haholo.
According to the method and if so.	Ho ea ka tsela eo le haeba ho joalo.
He has them now.	O na le bona jwale.
I thought the kids were the ones.	Ke ne ke nahana hore bana ke bona.
He looked at the group.	A sheba sehlopha.
He did not know what his feet were doing.	O ne a sa tsebe seo maoto a hae a se etsang.
A group of children were playing outside his house.	Sehlopha sa bana se ne se bapala ka ntle ho ntlo ea hae.
However, here it is.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ena.
He wanted to get out of there.	O ne a batla ho tsoa moo.
Their opinion was easy to believe.	Maikutlo a bona a ne a le bonolo ho lumela.
Just us.	Rona feela.
None of them spoke.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ileng a bua.
I have to give.	Ke tlameha ho fana.
I grabbed it quickly.	Ke ile ka tšoara kapele.
He did not think that he would spend the rest of his life there.	O ne a sa nahane hore o tla qeta bophelo bohle ba hae moo.
But nobody said anything.	Empa ho ne ho se motho ya buang letho.
But a fall could have occurred.	Empa ho oa ho ne ho ka ba teng.
It works well for them.	E sebetsa hantle ho bona.
That's a good thing.	Ke taba e ntle.
I love how it happened.	Ke rata kamoo ho etsahetseng kateng.
Here is one of them.	E 'ngoe ea tsona ke ena.
This is the time.	Ke nako ena.
But eat now.	Empa ja jwale.
He had a wife and children.	O ne a e-na le mosali le bana.
In a strange place.	Sebakeng se makatsang.
They can work hard for a long time.	Ba ka sebetsa ka thata nako e telele.
Her father died in the accident.	Ntate oa hae o ile a hlokahala kotsing.
He knew that he alone could do that.	O ne a tseba hore a le mong a ka khona ho etsa joalo.
I didn't have to.	Ke ne ke sa tlameha.
It was so delicious, so delicious.	E ne e le monate haholo, e monate haholo.
Keep trying until you have it.	Tsoela pele ho leka ho fihlela u e-na le eona.
But as with people.	Empa joalo ka batho.
I loved her so much.	Ke ne ke mo rata haholo.
It's a silly approach.	Ke mokhoa o hlokang kelello.
The young man was very happy that night.	Mohlankana eo o ne a thabile haholo bosiung boo.
They all refused.	Bohle ba ile ba hana.
Those who know do not speak.	Ba tsebang ha ba bue.
There is another way to see it.	Ho na le tsela e 'ngoe ea ho e bona.
We took too many.	Re nkile tse ngata haholo.
Anyone can enjoy them.	E mong le e mong a ka li thabela.
They will not give the whole picture.	Ba ke ke ba fana ka setšoantšo sohle.
Everyone has a bad time.	Motho e mong le e mong o na le nako e bohloko.
I enjoyed this book.	Ke thabetse buka ena.
The people here are living a very difficult life.	Batho ba mona ba phela bophelo bo boima haholo.
I love the idea, it really makes my day !.	Ke rata maikutlo, a hlile a etsa letsatsi la ka!.
I feel guilty.	Ke ikutloa ke le molato.
I understood what they wanted.	Ke ne ke utloisisa seo ba se batlang.
Thanks again.	Kea leboha hape.
I just need to talk to someone.	Ke hloka feela ho bua le motho.
They will notice.	Ba tla hlokomela.
Everyone had their own work to do.	E mong le e mong o ne a e-na le mosebetsi oa hae oo a lokelang ho o etsa.
You do this.	Sena u se etsa.
It worked amazingly well.	E ile ea sebetsa hantle ka mokhoa o makatsang.
It's a simple matter.	Taba e bonolo.
I thought he was fixing the whole thing.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o ne a lokisa taba eo kaofela.
But he did not do anything like that.	Empa ha aa ka a etsa letho la mofuta oo.
It will always be with us.	E tla ba le rona kamehla.
Her parents would know what to do.	Batsoali ba hae ba ne ba tla tseba seo ba lokelang ho se etsa.
Family is not the only issue.	Lelapa ha le bohlokoa feela.
It is not the job of the police.	Ha se mosebetsi oa mapolesa.
People loved him very much.	Batho ba ne ba mo rata haholo.
Long enough for both of us.	Nako e telele e lekaneng bakeng sa rona ka bobeli.
He got what he was looking for.	O ile a fumana seo a neng a se batla.
It went on for a long time.	E ile ea tsoela pele ka nako e telele.
He needed a job.	O ne a hloka mosebetsi.
I hope it helps others.	Ke tšepa hore e thusa ba bang.
Yes of course.	Ehlile ho joalo.
He did it because he knew he could.	O ile a e etsa hobane a ne a tseba hore a ka khona.
I'm happy too.	Le 'na ke thabile.
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le joalo.
You must have heard.	E tlameha ebe o utloile.
He pays school fees.	O lefa chelete ea sekolo.
But eventually you will see where it was best.	Empa qetellong u tla bona moo e neng e le molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He looks like he has something.	O shebahala eka o na le ho hong.
We will certainly have to find him.	Ka sebele re tla tlameha ho mo fumana.
Of course, you can do it now.	Ha e le hantle, u ka e etsa hona joale.
You will spend a lot of time with people there.	U tla qeta nako e ngata u e-na le batho moo.
I did nothing else.	Ha kea etsa letho le leng.
They had made a good time.	Ba ne ba entse nako e ntle.
Tom, who had done something wrong, felt guilty.	Tom, ea neng a entse ntho e mpe, o ile a ikutloa a le molato.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
Sometimes other things too.	Ka linako tse ling lintho tse ling hape.
Just right.	Hantle feela.
I don’t see that as an issue.	Ha ke bone taba eo e le taba.
And we need that.	Mme re hloka seo.
However, I did not say when.	Leha ho le joalo, ha kea bolela hore na ke neng.
I needed a name for my position.	Ke ne ke hloka lebitso bakeng sa boemo ba ka.
I'm very familiar with it, of course.	Ke e tloaetse haholo, ha e le hantle.
That's it, too.	Ho seo, hape.
This is a long question.	Ena ke potso e telele.
But none of them were human.	Empa ha ho le ea mong oa bona eo e neng e le motho.
It was a hard thing to take.	E ne e le ntho e thata ho e nka.
You take him again.	U mo nka hape.
Maybe it would.	Mohlomong e ne e tla.
No one told me how to do it.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mpolella mokhoa oa ho e etsa.
Read carefully.	Bala hantle.
It was not the first time.	E ne e se lekhetlo la pele.
However, her favorite food is human.	Leha ho le joalo, lijo tseo e li ratang haholo ke tsa batho.
I didn't want to know if he could do that.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho tseba hore na a ka etsa joalo.
People have to start thinking about it.	Batho ba tlameha ho qala ho nahana ka eona.
These are mine.	Tsena ke tsa ka.
Anyone who knows anything knows that.	E mong le e mong ya tsebang letho o tseba seo.
You know it when you hear it.	U e tseba ha u e utloa.
He came with his son.	A tla le mora wa hae.
Without this.	Ntle le ena.
That would be a.	Eo e tla ba a.
You know you have a date.	Ua tseba hore u na le letsatsi.
Look, don't talk.	Sheba, o seke wa bua.
A nice room with plenty of space.	Kamore e ntle e nang le sebaka se ngata.
You just have to ask.	U tlameha feela ho botsa.
They make good money.	Ba fana ka chelete e ntle.
Things are getting worse for them.	Lintho li ntse li ba tšoara.
It was not a pleasant feeling.	E ne e se maikutlo a monate.
Or to talk about it.	Kapa ho bua ka eona.
He used to do it for us when we were children.	O ne a tloaetse ho re etsetsa eona re sa le bana.
I am here.	Ke teng.
I need to do another one.	Ke hloka ho etsa e 'ngoe.
Many of these books are very helpful.	Tse ngata tsa libuka tsena li thusa haholo.
Too many to understand what he was hearing.	Ba bangata haholo ho utloisisa seo a neng a se utloa.
You will find many good times here.	U tla bona linako tse ngata tse monate mona.
Indeed, he was.	Ka sebele, o ne a le joalo.
But you could still hear a professional at work.	Empa u ne u ntse u ka utloa setsebi mosebetsing.
Yes, he decided that traveling would be better.	E, o ile a etsa qeto ea hore ho tsamaea ho tla ba molemo.
He certainly knew about it.	Ka sebele o ne a tseba ka eona.
I told them, of course not.	Ke ile ka ba bolella, ehlile ha ho joalo.
High levels of pain.	Boemo bo phahameng ba bohloko.
That's exactly right.	Ke hantle ruri.
The dog came first to play.	Ntja e ile ea tla pele e bapala.
And, yes, it was me.	Mme, e, e ne e le nna.
She was even more beautiful nearby.	O ne a le motle le ho feta haufi.
Not here or there.	E seng mona kapa hona moo.
It's not fun.	Ha e monate.
You will know better than I do.	O tla tseba ho mpheta.
She was then her husband.	Ka nako eo e ne e le monna oa hae.
However, you will get it soon.	Leha ho le joalo, u tla fumana kapele.
Everything that they came from.	Lintho tsohle tseo ba neng ba tsoa ho tsona.
We just have to know how to get it.	Re tlameha feela ho tseba mokhoa oa ho e fumana.
Which it is.	E leng eona.
I wonder what he thinks.	Kea ipotsa hore na o nahana eng.
But they did not really want that.	Empa ba ne ba hlile ba sa batle seo.
I did not ask how long he had been there or what he wanted.	Ha kea ka ka botsa hore na o na le nako e kae a le moo kapa hore na o batla eng.
First, open the book.	Pele, bula buka.
It was the same again.	Ho ne ho le joalo hape.
Some of them.	Tse ling tsa tsona.
His first day.	Letsatsi la hae la pele.
That he did not understand.	Hore o ne a sa utloisise.
That is the way of his people.	Ke tsela ea batho ba hae.
It’s hard to write a little bit and really.	Ho thata ho ngola hanyane le hantle.
He had to return to work, he said.	O ile a tlameha ho khutlela mosebetsing, a re.
And somebody will come to fix it.	Mme ho tla tla motho ho e lokisa.
However, it does so well.	Leha ho le joalo, e etsa ka mokhoa o motle hakana.
I like a lot of them.	Ke rata tse ngata tsa tsona.
The work you did there was very good.	Mosebetsi oo le neng le o etsa moo o ne o le motle haholo.
Just a man.	Monna feela.
He went home.	O ile hae.
That is not the question.	Ha se potso eo.
He represented all the people.	O ne a emetse batho bohle.
And he began to look.	Mme a qala ho sheba.
But maybe you can just wait until the morning.	Empa mohlomong u ka mpa ua ema ho fihlela hoseng.
I see it now.	Ke a e bona jwale.
However, that is not what we are talking about here.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se seo re buang ka sona mona.
I did not like it very much.	Ke ne ke sa e rate hakaalo.
It was just a lot of money.	E ne e le chelete e ngata feela.
He did not expect to find many.	O ne a sa lebella ho fumana tse ngata.
He made that day even more enjoyable.	O ile a etsa hore letsatsi leo le be monate le ho feta.
He left very quickly.	O ile a tsamaea kapele haholo.
But it's up to you.	Empa ho ho uena.
He was still unemployed and still had no money.	O ne a ntse a se na mosebetsi 'me ba ntse ba se na chelete.
Well, they just don't.	Hantle feela, ha ba etse joalo.
I did not expect them to care.	Ha kea lebella hore ba tsotelle.
Which was right for me.	E neng e le hantle ho nna.
And he had to pay them quickly.	Mme o ne a tlameha ho ba lefa kapele.
We did it.	Re li entse.
Or evening dresses, for that matter.	Kapa liaparo tsa mantsiboea, bakeng sa taba eo.
Then he would know.	Ka nako eo o ne a tla tseba.
And shame.	Le lihlong.
Did he think he could get out of that.	Na o ne a nahana hore a ka tsoa seo.
No, he was not.	Che, o ne a se joalo.
He used to drive before dinner.	O ne a tloaetse ho khanna pele ho lijo tsa mantsiboea.
Or the mother of the room.	Kapa 'mè oa kamore.
The good news was that no one could see it.	Litaba tse monate e ne e le hore ha ho motho ea neng a ka li bona.
Very interesting things to say.	Lintho tse monate haholo ho li bua.
Find a real man.	Fumana monna oa sebele.
Yes! 	Ee!
however.	leha ho le joalo.
Go out and talk about this.	Tsoa le bue ka taba ena.
Thanks in advance again.	Ke leboha esale pele hape.
I could make it easier.	Ke ne nka e etsa hore e be bonolo.
He is not guilty at all.	Ha a na molato ho hang.
We have one of them.	Re na le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
Her hair told her there was something wrong.	Moriri oa hae o ile oa mo bolella hore ho na le phoso.
It was what he seemed to be.	E ne e le seo a neng a bonahala a le sona.
And its content.	Le litaba tsa eona.
And children.	Le bana.
Buy a book only.	Reka buka feela.
He did not know that this place existed.	O ne a sa tsebe hore sebaka sena se teng.
This is very difficult for me.	Sena se boima haholo ho nna.
They are needed for this situation.	Li hlokahala bakeng sa boemo bona.
I really like this one.	Ke rata ena haholo.
I go, too.	Ke tsamaea, haholo.
But he refused to do it.	Empa o ne a hana ho e etsa.
He got some at the time but wanted to keep some.	O ile a fumana tse ling ka nako eo empa a batla ho boloka tse ling.
I talk a lot.	Ke bua haholo.
It was fun.	Ho ne ho le monate.
He spent several hours waiting for his turn.	O ile a qeta lihora tse 'maloa a emetse nako ea hae.
And now this.	Mme jwale sena.
Although it was a mistake.	Leha e ne e le phoso.
It seemed like there was no time.	E ne eka ha ho na nako.
What kind of car do you drive?	O khanna koloi ea mofuta ofe?
We don't have to go anywhere today.	Ha rea ​​tlameha ho ea kae kapa kae kajeno.
It was her husband.	E ne e le monna wa hae.
Maybe things are better now.	Mohlomong lintho li hantle hona joale.
And we let it go.	Mme re ile ra e tlohela.
I started writing a book.	Ke ile ka qala ho ngola buka.
My legs hurt.	Maoto a ka a bohloko.
He forgot to eat his food.	O ile a lebala ho ja lijo tsa hae.
He did not want them to see how he was feeling.	O ne a sa batle hore ba bone hore na o ikutloa joang.
It seems that anything bad can happen.	Ho bonahala eka ntho leha e le efe e mpe e ka etsahala.
Another easy way to get started.	Tsela e 'ngoe e bonolo ea ho qala.
And they obviously love it.	'Me ho hlakile hore baa e rata.
He was looking forward to it.	O ne a e lebeletse.
Trying to find out if they are still human.	Ho leka ho fumana hore na e ntse e le batho.
I can go on and on.	Nka tsoela pele le pele.
I was just trying to help.	Ke ne ke leka ho thusa feela.
I don't have a hard time at school.	Ha ke na nako e boima sekolong.
That's when we decided to get help.	Ke moo re ileng ra etsa qeto ea ho fumana thuso.
They stood like that for a long time.	Ba ile ba ema jwalo nako e telele.
Yes, he did.	E, o ne a e-na le eona.
I was devastated to see her this way.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko haholo ha ke mo bona ka tsela ena.
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
I am a child of my father too.	Ke ngoana oa ntate hape.
He had never told anyone.	O ne a eso bolelle motho letho.
That is very clear.	Seo se hlakile haholo.
It was a painful time for me.	E ne e le nako e bohloko ho 'na.
That will be your job.	Eo e tla ba mosebetsi oa hau.
Everyone needs to play it.	E mong le e mong o hloka ho e bapala.
I'm not sure why.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na hobaneng.
He refused to enter the room, of course.	O ne a hana ho kena ka phaposing, ehlile.
However, it does not matter.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho na taba.
His place has them all.	Sebaka sa hae se na le tsona kaofela.
Your news is usually good.	Litaba tsa hau hangata li ntle.
That is not enough.	Ha hoa lekana hoo.
We tried it anyway.	Re ile ra e leka leha ho le joalo.
There was no one.	Ho ne ho se motho.
And his feet.	Le maoto a hae.
The mother and father of the child go outside.	'Mè le ntate oa ngoana ba tsoela ka ntle.
My mother told me to do it.	'Mè o ile a mpolella hore ke etse joalo.
He knew what he was thinking.	O ne a tseba seo a se nahanang.
You know nothing about why you are here.	Ha u tsebe letho ka hore na ke hobane'ng ha u le mona.
Children need to dress up.	Bana ba hloka ho apara.
I never thought about that before.	Ha ke eso nahane ka seo pele.
However, we met, and it was good.	Leha ho le joalo, re ile ra kopana, 'me ho ne ho le molemo.
Who lived there.	Ea neng a lula moo.
However, when they do, nothing happens.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ba etsa joalo, ha ho letho le etsahalang.
It is beyond you.	E feta wena.
Thank you again, for doing what you did.	Kea u leboha hape, ka ho etsa seo u se entseng.
He just didn't like it.	O ne a sa e rate feela.
But now, he was too.	Empa joale, le eena o ne a le joalo.
With money came power.	Ka chelete ho ile ha tla matla.
We love them too.	Le rona rea ​​ba rata.
That went on for years.	Seo se ile sa tsoela pele ka lilemo tse ngata.
The same is true and appropriate.	Ho joalo le ho lokela.
So, I am very happy for him and everyone there.	Kahoo, ke thabile haholo bakeng sa hae le bohle ba teng.
There were no police, no one.	Ho ne ho se na mapolesa, ho se motho.
If that is what you want.	Haeba ke seo u se batlang.
And my son.	Le mora oa ka.
Try.	Leka.
I am the one with the simple task.	Ke 'na ea nang le mosebetsi o bonolo.
In fact, it did.	Ha e le hantle, ho ile ha e-ba joalo.
I wonder how it happened.	Kea ipotsa hore na ho bile joang.
So they come first.	Kahoo ba tla pele.
He needed to be healthy.	O ne a hloka ho phela hantle.
And for another reason.	Mme ka lebaka le leng hape.
I do not like his style of writing.	Ha ke rate mokhoa oa hae oa ho ngola.
He may even be here.	A ka ba a le teng mona.
We do not want this.	Ha re batle sena.
It's his team.	Ke sehlopha sa hae.
Now think about this.	Joale nahana ka sena.
Yes, he could.	E, o ne a ka khona ho etsa joalo.
And you have to do this for the first time.	'Me u lokela ho etsa sena lekhetlo la pele.
Who that person will be will be revealed.	Hore na motho eo e tla ba mang ho tla bonahala.
You may even like them more than a second time.	U ka ba ua li rata ho feta nako ea bobeli.
There was so much going on that I had to leave.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tse neng li etsahala hore ke tsamaee.
They are very, very dangerous.	Li kotsi haholo, haholo.
Everyone wants a real job.	E mong le e mong o batla mosebetsi oa sebele.
And my friends.	Le metsoalle ea ka.
He can make any decision he wants.	A ka etsa qeto efe kapa efe eo a e batlang.
This was the best thing ever.	Ena e ne e le ntho e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
Even true.	Leha e le 'nete.
I go back.	Ke khutlela morao.
And for money.	Le ka chelete.
So, they are all good or bad.	Ka hona, kaofela ke tse ntle kapa tse mpe.
You can ask her about it.	U ka mo botsa ka taba ena.
So far no one has had it.	Ho fihlela joale ha ho le ea mong ea nang le eona.
You're making a lot of money here.	U ntse u fumana chelete e ngata mona.
There is pain.	Ho na le bohloko.
One of the many.	E 'ngoe ea tse ngata.
This was a place.	Sena e ne e le sebaka.
That's nice.	O monate seo.
And no others.	Hape ha ba bang.
He did not allow them to meet with him.	Ha aa ka a ba lumella hore ba kopane le eena.
Nothing was too hard for them.	Ho ne ho se letho le neng le le boima haholo bakeng sa bona.
But these are difficult questions.	Empa tsena ke lipotso tse thata.
These are things you should always do.	Ke lintho tseo u lokelang ho li etsa kamehla.
That is what we need to live.	Ke seo re se hlokang ho phela.
I will take care of them.	Ke tla ba hlokomela.
I have to think about that.	Ke lokela ho nahana ka seo.
All of this will take time.	Sena sohle se tla nka nako.
Many others go.	Ba bang ba bangata ba ya.
So it starts.	Kahoo e qala.
I'm sure they won't let him.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ba ke ke ba mo lumella.
This is not a good thing.	Sena ha se ntho e ntle.
It is hard work.	Ke mosebetsi o boima.
I hope you feel better soon.	Ke tšepa u ikutloa u le betere haufinyane.
We were there too.	Le rona re ne re le teng.
Yes, that would be the only thing.	E, hoo e ka ba eona ntho feela.
We just did it.	Re sa tsoa e etsa.
I hope you find it.	Kea tšepa u tla e fumana.
It is difficult to find a doctor.	Ho thata ho fumana ngaka.
What were they doing?	Ba ne ba etsa’ng?
So here they are again.	Kahoo ke bana hape.
She is a girl.	O ngoanana.
Pretend it doesn't exist.	Etsa eka ha e eo.
She is in a good place.	O sebakeng se setle.
Things are not so good for us.	Lintho ha li ntle hakaalo ho rona.
He wanted to know what had happened.	O ile a batla ho tseba se etsahetseng.
We talk about her life as a mother.	Re bua ka bophelo ba hae e le mme.
It just happened.	E sa tsoa etsahala.
I would like to.	Nka rata ho.
The house was in a good location.	Ntlo e ne e le sebakeng se setle.
I can buy this.	Nka reka sena.
If only it were that easy.	Hoja feela ho ne ho le bonolo hakaalo.
Look at what the girl did.	Sheba seo ngoanana eo a se entseng.
I hope this will help someone.	Ke tšepa hore sena se tla thusa motho e mong.
It seems easy enough to get out.	Ho bonahala ho le bonolo ka ho lekaneng ho tsoa ka ntle.
There is food for just one.	Ho na le lijo bakeng sa a le mong feela.
He says he really has but.	O re ka 'nete o na le empa.
Or for life, it seems.	Kapa bakeng sa bophelo, ho bonahala eka.
I will definitely do and eat these again.	Ka sebele ke tla etsa le ho ja tsena hape.
But this too is obvious.	Empa sena le sona se hlakile.
Well, it would have to do that.	Be, e ne e tla tlameha ho etsa joalo.
They were alone.	Ba ne ba le bang.
I still don't know much about him.	Ke ntse ke sa tsebe hakaalo ka eena.
She felt love for him when she first saw him.	O ile a ikutloa a mo rata ha a qala ho mo bona.
I can't have this.	Ha ke khone ho ba le sena.
This was all a very bad mistake.	Ena kaofela e ne e le phoso e mpe haholo.
Day of the week.	Letsatsi la beke.
It's a great place to hear it.	Ke sebaka se setle sa ho bo utloa.
Some may even be close to you.	Ba bang ba ka ba ba le haufi le uena.
It is not easy to find it but you will see it if you can.	Ha ho bonolo ho e fumana empa o tla e bona ha o khona.
Before the police came.	Pele mapolesa a tla.
In fact, very good stuff.	Ka 'nete, lintho tse ntle haholo.
You know very well.	U tseba haholo.
That was not my style.	Eo e ne e se mokhoa oa ka.
That is why people love him so much.	Ke kahoo batho ba mo ratang hakana.
The case was arrested by the police.	Molato o ile a tšoaroa ke mapolesa.
It has to go now.	E tlameha ho tsamaea hona joale.
The fact is, he did not do that.	Taba ke hore ha ea ka ea etsa joalo.
But it did happen.	Empa ho hlakile hore ho ile ha etsahala.
"No more pain," he said.	A re, "ha ho sa le bohloko."
But make no mistake about it.	Empa u se ke ua etsa phoso.
So things like this are very helpful.	Kahoo lintho tse kang tsena li thusa haholo.
You must read it someday.	O tlameha ho e bala ka letsatsi le leng.
To love him.	Ho mo rata.
The police interrogated all in attendance.	Mapolesa a ile a botsa bohle ba neng ba le teng lipotso.
Like, finally.	Joalo, qetellong.
She looked at her hair.	A sheba moriri wa hae.
There was nothing that he could see that he did not like.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a neng a ka bona hore ha a le rate.
You do not have to travel alone.	Ha ua lokela ho tsamaea u le mong.
If you have it, it is.	Haeba u na le eona, ho joalo.
He ate quickly.	A ja kapele.
I don't talk to a man very much.	Ha ke bue le monna haholo.
The same can be true for us.	Ho ka ba joalo le ho rōna.
He was happy.	O ne a thabile.
But think again.	Empa nahana hape.
Very well, we will let it go.	Hantle haholo, re tla e tlohela.
And we found out quickly.	Mme re ile ra fumana kapele.
And thank you! 	Mme kea leboha!
You have never met them.	Ha o eso kopane le bona.
He knew he was near.	O ne a tseba hore o haufi.
We go back a long time.	Re khutlela morao nako e telele.
We get that a lot.	Re fumana seo haholo.
He likes his ideas.	O rata maikutlo a hae.
When he first entered the room.	Ha a qala ho kena ka phaposing.
Then he stopped.	Joale o ile a ema.
Most likely, they will.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe ba tla etsa joalo.
Maybe it was that easy.	Mohlomong ho ne ho le bonolo joalo.
Another reason you are so easy to love.	Lebaka le leng leo u leng bonolo ho le rata.
It's none of our business.	Ha se taba ea rona.
He loved her every day.	O ne a mo rata letsatsi le letsatsi.
It looks new.	E shebahala e le ncha.
How does that work?	Seo se sebetsa joang?
And he tried.	Mme o ile a leka.
She has a hard job and needs help.	O na le mosebetsi o boima mme o hloka thuso.
Then do it again.	Ebe u e etsa hape.
We no longer need money.	Ha re sa hloka chelete.
This room was also empty.	Kamore ena le eona e ne e se na letho.
I did not find it so easy to fall asleep.	Ke ne ke sa bone ho le bonolo hakaalo ho robala.
Some foods do not mix.	Lijo tse ling ha li kopane.
The same is true for me.	Ho joalo le ho 'na.
I felt so happy.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke thabile haholo.
You mean it.	U e bolela.
You keep asking too many questions at once.	U lula u botsa lipotso tse ngata ka nako e le 'ngoe.
That's another thing.	Ke ntho e 'ngoe.
I don't know if that's strange.	Ha ke tsebe haeba hoo ke ntho e makatsang.
One is and the other is.	E 'ngoe ke 'me e 'ngoe ke .
And it wants us.	Mme e re batla.
I got the money.	Ke fumane chelete.
He was good to me.	O ne a le molemo ho nna.
Drink water.	Noa metsi.
Some thought that someone would do it.	Ba bang ba ne ba nahana hore motho e mong o tla e etsa.
I was expecting him to fall asleep right away.	Ke ne ke lebeletse hore o tla robala hona hoo.
This is very important.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo.
It could not stay that way for long.	E ne e ke ke ea lula joalo nako e telele.
He could not learn to read.	O ne a sa khone ho ithuta ho bala.
They really need it, after all.	Ba hlile baa li hloka, ka mor'a tsohle.
He wants us to think that time is running out.	O rata hore re nahane hore nako e teng.
However, it is clearly not an important issue for us.	Leha ho le joalo, ho hlakile hore ha se taba ea bohlokoa ho rona.
It seems unlikely that they will ever meet again.	Ho bonahala eka ha ho bonolo hore ba tla kopana hape.
There is nothing out here.	Ha ho letho ka ntle mona.
I'm sorry about that.	Ke masoabi ka letho.
No need to go anywhere.	Ha ho hlokahale ho ea kae kapa kae.
He is the one we need to take care of.	Ke eena eo re lokelang ho mo hlokomela.
He doesn't think his life is my fault.	Ha a nahane hore bophelo ba hae ke molato oa ka.
The boy did indeed look good.	Ka sebele moshanyana eo o ne a bonahala e le eena.
Our money is their money.	Chelete ea rona ke chelete ea bona.
We will have children.	Re tla ba le bana.
It will help us.	E tla re thusa.
They think they have their husband.	Ba nahana hore ba na le monna oa bona.
No, he does not.	Che, ha a etse joalo.
Maybe he already has it.	Mohlomong o se a ntse a e-na le eona.
That means we can have a wonderful life together.	Seo se bolela hore re ka fumana bophelo bo monate feela hammoho.
It has been difficult, we just have to keep going.	Ho bile thata, re tlameha feela ho tsoela pele.
Where will the money come from?	Chelete e tla tsoa hokae?
That was a few days ago.	E ne e le matsatsi a 'maloa a fetileng.
We need to ask ourselves this.	Re lokela ho ipotsa sena.
In it he says.	Ho eona o re.
We have done the best we can.	Re entse mosebetsi o motle ka ho fetisisa oo re ka o khonang.
As soon as he enters the room, he feels powerless.	Hang ha a kena ka kamoreng, o ikutloa a se na matla.
He wants it.	Oa o batla.
But now go faster.	Empa joale tsamaea kapele.
Some people just stand there.	Batho ba bang ba ema feela.
I understand why they would feel this way.	Kea utloisisa hore na ke hobane’ng ha ba ne ba ka ikutloa ka tsela ena.
He wants your money.	O batla chelete ea hau.
I believe that is not the case.	Ke lumela hore ha ho joalo.
This is good news.	Tsena ke litaba tse monate.
There is no chance.	Haho monyetla.
It was a difficult time for him.	E ne e le nako e boima ho eena.
I'm not sure it will happen.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore e tla etsahala.
I can't let you in.	Ha ke khone ho u lumella ho kena.
Yes, he did notice it now.	E, o ile a e hlokomela jwale.
It makes my job a lot easier. 	E etsa hore mosebetsi oa ka o be bonolo haholo. 
when.	neng.
You will have to do everything.	O tla tlameha ho etsa tsohle.
We see this happening again.	Re bona sena se etsahala hape.
Three days passed.	Ho ile ha feta matsatsi a mararo.
He had never met them.	O ne a eso kopane le bona.
Make sure	Etsa bonnete
You have spent your time, as it were.	U qetile nako ea hau, joalo ka ha ho le joalo.
But thank you all.	Empa re leboha kaofela ha rona.
He does a great job.	O etsa mosebetsi o moholo.
You might say that such a thing is not fun.	U ka 'na ua re ha ho monate.
So, we don't think about it here.	Ka hona, ha re e nahane mona.
It's not just some of us.	Ha se ho ba bang ba rona feela.
It's too close for him.	E haufi haholo bakeng sa hae.
This is exactly what happened here.	Sena ke sona hantle se etsahetseng mona.
This is the closest thing they have ever come to.	Ena ke eona e haufi ka ho fetisisa eo ba kileng ba e tla.
Anyone is fine with me.	Mang kapa mang o hantle le nna.
He could do anything for you.	O ne a ka u etsetsa eng kapa eng.
Of course, we cannot.	Ha e le hantle, re ke ke ra khona.
I refuse to do it.	Ke hana ho e etsa.
It can not be.	E ka se be joalo.
Do whatever it takes to get back to that.	Etsa eng kapa eng ho khutlela ho seo.
I can't say when.	Ha ke khone ho bolela hore na ke neng.
However, the reason seems to be a matter of money.	Leha ho le joalo, lebaka le bonahala e le taba ea chelete.
I continued reading.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele ho bala.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
Or they may be.	Kapa ba ka ba joalo.
That came that night.	Seo se ile sa fihla bosiung boo.
Yes, right there.	E, hona moo.
But it is better to be aware of a difficult situation.	Empa ho molemo ho hlokomela ha boemo bo le boima.
It took us hours to get there.	Ho ile ha re nka lihora ho fihla moo.
No, no, that's wrong.	Che, che, ke phoso.
So, there is usually a place there, too.	Kahoo, hangata ho na le sebaka moo, hape.
But that too was not the case.	Empa le eona e ne e se eona kaofela.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ha ke tsebe hore na molato ke eng ka nna.
They love you.	Ba u rata.
I want to live with you.	Ke batla ho phela le wena.
It was longer than the first.	E ne e le telele ho feta ea pele.
I just reject that idea.	Ke hana mohopolo oo feela.
There are some strange things.	Ho na le lintho tse makatsang.
These are not stupid people.	Bana hase batho ba hlokang kelello.
I'm going to bed now.	Ke il'o robala hona joale.
You can know without knowing.	O ka tseba ntle le ho tseba.
I can't understand why.	Ha ke khone ho utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng.
More than a few years.	Ho feta lilemo tse 'maloa.
I just see what happens.	Ke bona feela se etsahalang.
It may not be true or not.	E ka 'na eaba hase 'nete kapa che.
And that was easy money.	Mme eo e ne e le chelete e bonolo.
Then he started telling people.	Ebe o qala ho bolella batho.
Thank you so much for talking to me.	Ke leboha haholo ha o bua le nna.
You have to watch the news every day.	U lokela ho shebella litaba letsatsi le leng le le leng.
Too much to read.	E ngata haholo ho e bala.
And he never goes back to where he was before.	Le hona ha a sa tla khutlela moo a neng a le teng pele.
So try.	Kahoo leka.
Then something amazing happens.	Joale ho etsahala ntho e makatsang.
He had never thought of it that way before.	O ne a e-s’o ka a e nahana hakaalo pele.
The real problem exists.	Bothata ba sebele bo teng.
It still works.	E ntse e sebetsa.
Thank you very, very much.	Ke leboha haholo, haholo.
A person may like his work or not.	Motho a ka rata mosebetsi oa hae kapa che.
This does not matter.	Sena ha se na taba.
You are beautiful.	U motle.
Behind every man and woman there is a delicious meal.	Ka mor'a monna le mosali e mong le e mong e moholo ho na le lijo tse monate.
It was fun to be there.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba teng.
My feet are wet.	Maoto a ka a metsi.
It seems like a good time to get in.	Ho bonahala eka ke nako e ntle ea ho kena.
You do your best, and you trust.	U etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang, 'me ua tšepa.
It can take.	E ka nka.
Moreover, this happens.	Ho feta moo, sena se etsahala.
It took several years of hard work.	Ho ile ha nka lilemo tse ’maloa tsa mosebetsi o boima.
Drinking his strength.	Ho noa matla a hae.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho ne ho le joalo.
Your children should come first.	Bana ba hao ba lokela ho tla pele.
Any more questions?	Lipotso tse ling hape?
There were not many people who could keep up with him.	Ho ne ho se batho ba bangata ba neng ba khona ho tsoela pele le eena.
He just enjoyed the feeling.	O ile a thabela maikutlo feela.
What you do, and what you are.	Seo u se etsang, le seo u leng sona.
To him he didn’t care if anyone was tough.	Ho eena o ne a sa tsotelle hore na ho na le motho ea thata.
We fell asleep.	Re ile ra robala.
You are not sure what you are talking about.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na u bua ka eng.
He does nothing.	Ha a etse letho.
But it's fun.	Empa ho monate.
I was clear.	Ke ne ke hlakile.
It has everything you need.	E na le tsohle tseo o li hlokang.
He said he had never met anyone like me.	O ile a re ha a so ka a tseba motho ea tšoanang le 'na.
I will pay you.	ke tla o lefa.
He knew they were there.	O ne a tseba hore ba ne ba le teng.
They used force.	Ba ile ba sebelisa matla.
I have never seen anything like it.	Ha ke eso bone ntho e jwalo.
We take that approach here.	Re nka mokhoa oo mona.
We just have to.	Re tlameha feela.
If you do not like it go somewhere else.	Haeba u sa e rate e ea sebakeng se seng.
He opened the car door.	A bula lemati la koloi.
That's what you're all here to do.	Ke seo bohle le leng mona ho se etsa.
But we are coming now.	Empa re ea fihla hona joale.
If you wanted to.	Haeba u ne u batla.
But it is coming.	Empa e ntse e tla.
I'm glad it did.	Ke thabetse hore e entse joalo.
I needed it.	Ke ne ke hloka.
He refused to go.	O ile a hana ho tsamaea.
I can do nothing.	Ha ke khone ho etsa letho.
It was hard.	Ho ne ho le thata.
We cannot imagine the error that might exist before us.	Re ke ke ra nahana ka phoso e ka bang teng pele ho rona.
I think they should all win.	Ke nahana hore kaofela ba lokela ho hlola.
That was exactly what it was.	E ne e le hantle seo e neng e le sona.
I get that.	Ke fumana seo.
I will never do anything again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke etsa letho.
You look nice.	O shebahala hantle.
This work is important.	Mosebetsi ona ke oa bohlokoa.
And that would surely be a problem.	Mme ruri seo e ne e tla ba bothata.
We would not have known this.	Re ka be re sa ka ra tseba sena.
I trust him now.	Kea mo tšepa ee joale.
He should love the opportunity to talk to her.	O lokela ho rata monyetla oa ho bua le eena.
He says nothing about his past family life.	Ha a bue letho ka bophelo ba lelapa la hae bo fetileng.
He did not expect that.	O ne a sa lebella seo.
But that is not the case now.	Empa ha se boemo ba hona joale.
It should not.	Ha ea lokela.
Or it looked like that.	Kapa se ne se shebahala joalo.
They are the best.	Ke tse molemo ka ho fetisisa.
There was no pain at all.	Ho ne ho se na bohloko ho hang.
So you might as well buy it.	Kahoo u ka rata ho e reka.
People say it will be seen.	Batho ba re ho tla bonahala.
That was the last one.	Eo e bile ea ho qetela.
He was in the area.	O ne a le sebakeng.
You will see a bicycle and a car.	U tla bona baesekele le koloi.
That type no longer exists.	Mofuta oo ha o sa le teng.
But it is even harder to see that he is suffering.	Empa ho thata le ho feta ho bona o utloa bohloko.
I've heard both.	Ke utloile bobeli.
And sometimes they don't.	'Me ka linako tse ling ha ba etse joalo.
But then he got a call.	Empa joale o ile a fumana mohala.
The important thing is that they start well.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore ba qala hantle.
You are hurting for yourself.	U utloa bohloko bakeng sa hau.
Apparently some did.	Ho bonahala ba bang ba ile ba etsa joalo.
You would probably tell him something like this.	Mohlomong u ne u tla mo bolella ntho e kang ena.
I will watch it every day.	Ke tla e shebella letsatsi le letsatsi.
The doctor came.	Ngaka e ile ea tla.
They didn't want to look, you know.	Ba ne ba sa batle ho sheba, le a tseba.
It is his job.	Ke mosebetsi oa hae.
He always sang together.	O ne a lula a bina hammoho.
It was a very strange thing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang haholo.
They are looking forward to it now.	Ba e lebeletse hona joale.
They were all like that.	Kaofela ba ne ba le joalo.
It seemed very difficult.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le thata haholo.
One of them was my husband.	E mong oa bona e ne e le monna oa ka.
But there is nothing he can do about it.	Empa ha ho letho leo a ka le etsang ka hona.
Unless he had.	Ntle le hore o ne a na le.
I'm just saying.	Ke mpa ke re feela.
He said he was living a miserable life.	O ile a bolela hore o phela bophelo bo bohloko.
There were front and back.	Ho ne ho ena le pele le morao.
I will also read a book.	Hape ke tlo bala buka.
And yet they come.	Mme leha ho le jwalo ba tla.
He knew what to expect now.	O ne a tseba seo a lokelang ho se lebella jwale.
He wishes he could be somewhere else.	O lakatsa eka a ka be a le sebakeng se seng.
But sometimes that happens.	Empa ka linako tse ling seo sea etsahala.
He was alone.	O ne a le mong.
So it was clear that something was wrong.	Kahoo ho ne ho hlakile hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
I really needed that.	Ke ne ke hlile ke hloka seo.
However, I try to understand you.	Leha ho le joalo, ke leka ho u utloisisa.
Time had to be right.	Nako e ne e lokela ho ba hantle.
You do not know what the situation will be like.	Ha u tsebe hore na boemo bo tla ba joang.
That can help keep things in perspective.	Seo se ka thusa hore lintho li lule li le joalo.
And it is probably the most important fact.	'Me mohlomong ke 'nete ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
My friends have not seen him for a week.	Metsoalle ea ka e na le beke e sa mo bone.
There were a lot of first ones, too.	Ho ne ho bile le tse ngata tsa pele, hape.
Don't just read it.	U se ke ua e bala feela.
She had never been so beautiful before.	O ne a eso be motle hakaalo pele.
It would make it very difficult.	E ne e tla etsa hore ho be thata haholo.
They make money for it.	Ba e etsetsa chelete.
I wish everyone here could have some of them.	Ke lakatsa eka motho e mong le e mong mona a ka ba le tse ling tsa tsona.
They both have their problems.	Ka bobeli li na le mathata a tsona.
I could not do that at all.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho etsa joalo ho hang.
As we have to go back.	Ha re ntse re tlameha ho khutlela morao.
They were very fun.	Ba ne ba le monate haholo.
He knows he will never win.	O a tseba hore a ke ke a hlola a hlola.
Many.	Ba bangata.
Time to get to work.	Nako ea ho kena mosebetsing.
User friendly.	Ho bonolo ho e sebelisa.
I thought you would say something like that.	Ke ne ke na le maikutlo a hore u tla bua ntho e joalo.
We want him to be here all his life.	Re batla hore a be mona bophelo bohle ba hae.
None of us could do that.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a ka etsa joalo.
It is a wonderful place to visit.	Ke sebaka se monate ho se etela.
He prepared dinner.	O ile a lokisa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
We all know our job.	Kaofela re tseba mosebetsi oa rona.
It is now or never.	Ke hona joale kapa ha ho mohla.
I know it will be hard to talk about.	Kea tseba hore ho tla ba thata ho bua ka eona.
I need to know.	Ke hloka ho tseba.
I strongly believe.	Ke lumela haholo.
There was not enough space for him to stand.	Ho ne ho se sebaka se lekaneng hore a ka ema.
There is one possibility.	Ho na le monyetla o le mong.
There was no real father there.	Ho ne ho se ntate oa 'nete moo.
But he was, and he will be.	Empa o ne a le teng, mme o tla ba teng.
I was traveling with someone at the time.	Ke ne ke tsamaea le motho e mong ka nako eo.
I have nothing to say.	Ha ho letho leo nka le buang.
We do not know.	Ha re tsebe.
I work very well.	Ke sebetsa hantle haholo.
This is a dangerous place.	Sena ke sebaka se kotsi.
He could walk.	O ne a ka tsamaea.
There have been too many.	Ho bile le tse ngata haholo.
Read more.	Bala haholoanyane.
I thought he meant someone else.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o bolela motho e mong.
We will be leaving.	Re tla be re tsamaea.
He is truly powerful.	O matla ruri.
So he never spoke to her.	Kahoo ha ho mohla a kileng a bua le eena.
We had our last day that night.	Re bile le letsatsi la rona la ho qetela bosiung boo.
Just do it.	E etse feela.
It should be very helpful.	E lokela ho thusa haholo.
It's too long.	E telele.
That's what he wants.	Ke seo a se batlang.
We are working to fix the problem.	Re sebetsa ho lokisa bothata.
And there is more to come.	Mme ho sa na le tse ngata tse tlang.
She never heard from her husband.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a utloa ho tsoa ho monna oa hae.
Today, that is not the case.	Kajeno, ha ho joalo.
I just loved reading this book.	Ke ne ke mpa ke rata ho bala buka ena.
We will go in with you.	Re tla kena le wena.
This was a real group.	Ena e ne e le sehlopha sa 'nete.
I wonder what that looked like.	Kea ipotsa hore na seo se ne se shebahala joang.
Nobody there.	Haho motho moo.
You will not have a second chance.	U ke ke ua ba le monyetla oa bobeli.
He slept very late at night.	O ile a robala bosiu haholo.
But that could have lasted longer.	Empa seo se ka be se ile sa tsoela pele ka nako e telele.
But he will not come for himself.	Empa a ke ke a tla bakeng sa hae.
None of these are easy to think of.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea eona e bonolo ho nahana ka eona.
He went back into the room.	O ile a khutlela ka kamoreng.
They tried it and loved it.	Ba ile ba e leka mme ba e rata.
If he was already gone.	Haeba a ne a se a le sieo.
Where were we?	Re ne re le hokae?
Carefully, they opened the door.	Ka hloko, ba ile ba bula lemati.
However, this is not important.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se bohlokoa.
Every woman wants to.	Mosali e mong le e mong o batla ho.
My father would have made a party.	Ntate a ka be a entse mokete.
But still we are here.	Empa leha ho le joalo re mona.
She enjoys swimming.	O thabela ho ya sesa.
It is necessary to have a car.	Ho hlokahala ho ba le koloi.
This is what we want to do with it.	Sena ke seo re batlang ho se etsa ka eona.
I do not understand why people should cry.	Ha ke utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha batho ba lokela ho lla.
He did not know what was required.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ho hlokahala eng.
Ask for help.	Kopa thuso.
There can be no better time than now.	Ho ka se be le nako e betere ho feta jwale.
My father said nothing.	Ntate ha a ka a bua letho.
It uses things.	E sebelisa lintho.
For a long, long time it was useless.	Ka nako e telele, e telele e ne e se na thuso.
No, it was not.	Che, e ne e se bona.
Now that is not so much fun.	Hona joale seo ha se monate haholo.
Good question!	Potso e ntle!
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le joalo.
No one was injured.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a tsoa kotsi.
But we are sorry for what happened.	Empa re utloa bohloko ka se etsahetseng.
I was close to him.	Ke ne ke le haufi le eena.
He did not know anyone there.	O ne a sa tsebe motho moo.
However, this was not always the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se joalo kamehla.
You need to eat so that you can sleep.	U hloka ho ja e le hore u tsebe ho robala.
You get that.	O fumana seo.
You have to learn.	U lokela ho ithuta.
He had never wanted anything so bad.	Ho ne ho se mohla a kileng a batla ntho e mpe hakaalo.
How to play him.	Mokhoa oa ho mo bapala.
So, when is he coming?	Joale, o tla ea neng?
That will require a lot of hard work.	Seo se tla hloka mosebetsi o boima haholo.
Talk to my son, he said.	Bua le mora oa ka, a re.
There must be something wrong with the mother.	E tlameha ebe ho na le taba le mme.
He drinks his coffee.	O noa kofi ea hae.
He came home and found his wife happy.	O ile a fihla hae a fumana mosali oa hae a thabile.
They told us we knew nothing.	Ba ile ba re bolella hore ha re tsebe letho.
And there was something.	Mme ho ne ho ena le ho hong.
I need to talk.	Ke hloka ho bua.
There is food and water.	Ho na le lijo le metsi.
He didn't, of course.	O ne a sa etsa joalo, ehlile.
When this happens.	Ha sena se etsahala.
I really like them.	Ke li rata haholo.
They need to work.	Ba hloka ho sebetsa.
He said it took time.	A re ho nkile nako.
For all who have ever lived.	Bakeng sa bohle ba kileng ba phela.
It's the same kind of mind.	Ke mofuta o le mong oa kelello.
He did not eat or drink.	O ne a sa je kapa a noa.
But you can help us win.	Empa o ka re thusa ho hlola.
He will not go to open.	A ke ke a ea ho bula.
Someone has to do it.	Ho na le motho ea lokelang ho e etsa.
I'm going to have a good time.	Ke tl'o ba le nako e monate.
The family was devastated.	Lelapa le ne le utloile bohloko haholo.
It seems to work now.	E bonahala e sebetsa hona joale.
We express our views on the issues.	Re bua maikutlo a rona ka litaba.
She is excited about something.	O thabetse ho hong.
He saw this as very dangerous.	O ile a bona sena se le kotsi haholo.
However, it was often a matter of opinion.	Leha ho le joalo, hangata e ne e le litaba tsa maikutlo.
And as a human being, it is a mistake we have made.	Mme ha e le motho, ke phoso eo re e entseng.
No wonder.	Hase ntho e makatsang.
But of course everyone knew he would not live.	Empa ehlile bohle ba ne ba tseba hore a ke ke a phela.
A week passed.	Ho ile ha feta beke.
It was not easy.	E ne e se bonolo.
I think of you and your family.	Ke nahana ka uena le lelapa la hau.
We all know what happened next.	Kaofela rea ​​tseba se ileng sa etsahala ka mor’a moo.
Here it comes.	Ke ena e tla.
This was something he was going to get into the space with.	Ena e ne e le ntho eo a neng a tla kena sebakeng ka eona.
I do not know when.	Ha ke tsebe neng.
He's just trying to help.	O leka ho thusa feela.
I think he is.	Ke nahana hore o teng.
The point was to think about human activity.	Taba e ne e le ho nahana ka mosebetsi oa motho.
It was a picture.	E ne e le setšoantšo.
Of course,.	Ehlile,.
We have a lot in common.	Re na le lintho tse ngata tseo re tšoanang ka tsona.
I knew him now.	Ke ne ke mo tseba joale.
Something you have never done before.	Ntho eo o so kang o e etsa pele.
However, she will be fine.	Leha ho le joalo, o tla phela hantle.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
Certainly, he did not.	Ka sebele, o ne a se na eona.
We know what happened next.	Re tseba se ileng sa etsahala ka mor’a moo.
I look like a professional.	Ke sheba hore ke setsebi.
Only you, child.	Ke uena feela, ngoana.
He felt very tired.	O ne a ikutloa a khathetse haholo.
But this is the last chance.	Empa ona ke monyetla oa ho qetela.
Everyone is talking about this.	E mong le e mong o bua ka sena.
We all looked at him.	Kaofela re ile ra mo sheba.
So, you only get better when you get it.	Kahoo, u phela hantle feela ha u e fumana.
But he did not know where he was.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe moo a leng teng.
But this can be wrong.	Empa sena e ka ba phoso.
Nor is it the last.	Hape ha se ea ho qetela.
There was nothing.	Ho ne ho se na letho.
And here's the amazing thing.	Mme ntho e makatsang ke ena.
I'm so glad you have us today.	Ke thabile haholo hore ebe u na le rona kajeno.
The sad truth is that it makes you tired.	'Nete ka bohloko ke hore e etsa hore u khathetse.
We enjoy it.	Rea e thabela.
They certainly continued to make my stay enjoyable.	Ka sebele ba ile ba tsoela pele ho etsa hore ho lula ha ka ho be monate.
We can understand something.	Re ka utloisisa ho hong.
But still we come.	Empa leha ho le joalo rea tla.
We can talk more tomorrow.	Re ka bua haholo hosane.
It is very clear.	Ho hlakile haholo.
Same for everyone, really.	E tšoanang bakeng sa bohle, ka 'nete.
He spoke only when he wanted to.	O ne a bua feela ha a batla.
It was necessary to find a way back.	Ho ne ho hlokahala ho fumana tsela ea ho khutla.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
And after that, it was up to me.	'Me ka mor'a moo, e ne e le ho 'na.
Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.	Lijo tsa hoseng ke lijo tseo ke li ratang tsa letsatsi.
However, they did their job.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ile ba etsa mosebetsi oa bona.
I hope this will help you with your decision.	Kea tšepa hore sena se tla u thusa ka qeto ea hau.
I did not apply for a job.	Ha kea ka ka kopa mosebetsi.
Though tired, he persevered.	Le hoja a ne a khathetse, o ile a tsoela pele.
I think you will eventually find what you are looking for.	Ke nahana hore qetellong u tla fumana seo u se batlang.
A man in place of a boy.	Monna sebakeng sa moshanyana.
And he saw what happened with that.	Mme o bone se etsahetseng ka seo.
We used to do them.	Re ne re tloaetse ho li etsa.
I love that girl.	Ke rata ngoanana eo.
I told her so much that she was the only one who knew that it was true.	Ke mo boleletse haholo hore ke eena feela ea tsebang hore ke 'nete.
There was nothing I could say.	Ho ne ho se letho leo nka le buang.
She was crying.	O ne a lla.
Really nice to hear from you.	Ehlile ho monate ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
Book of life.	Buka ea bophelo.
However, this is clearly not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho hlakile hore sena ha se joalo.
I do not believe it will be so.	Ha ke lumele hore ho tla ba joalo.
Which is exactly what he did.	E leng sona seo a se entseng hantle.
Legally, they do not.	Ka molao, ha ba etse joalo.
However, there was someone else.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le motho e mong.
He thought he knew what to expect.	O ne a nahana hore o tseba seo a lokelang ho se lebella.
No more problems.	Ha ho sa le bothata.
There was nothing we could do about it now.	Ho ne ho se letho leo re ka le etsang ka seo hona joale.
It is not enough.	Ha ea lekana.
There was nothing in the room.	Ho ne ho se na letho ka kamoreng.
Maybe I can go on.	Mohlomong nka tsoela pele.
However, that will happen.	Leha ho le joalo, seo se tla etsahala.
They did not expect this.	Ba ne ba sa lebella sena.
It has been there for years.	E bile moo ka lilemo.
Other than that, it was fun.	Ntle ho moo, e ne e le monate.
You have to decide if this is important to you.	U lokela ho etsa qeto ea hore na sena ke sa bohlokoa ho uena.
He was great.	O ne a le moholo.
And whatever happened to it.	Le eng kapa eng e etsahetseng ho eona.
The thinking person goes back.	Motho ea nahanang o khutlela morao.
It certainly did.	Ehlile e entse joalo.
We come to you.	Re tla ho wena.
I had no idea who had ever slept with me.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke mang ea kileng a robala le 'na.
He told them it was too close.	A ba bolella hore e haufi haholo.
And you, you work so hard.	Mme wena, o sebetsa haholo.
That is, we want the good news.	Ke hore, re batla litaba tse molemo.
I'm not sure if that is still the case.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ho ntse ho le joalo.
It's not easy, he admits.	Ha ho bonolo, oa lumela.
It was a very bad time for me.	E ne e le nako e mpe haholo ho 'na.
He had a chance to.	O ne a e-na le monyetla oa ho.
We know he loves his job.	Rea tseba hore o rata mosebetsi oa hae.
We are accustomed to the sun.	Re tloaetse letsatsi.
Nothing happened to that man.	Ha ho letho le etsahetseng ka monna eo.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
If you want to go, then go.	Haeba u batla ho tsamaea, joale tsamaea.
Also writing books.	Hape le libuka tsa ho ngola.
I still don't like the place.	Ke ntse ke sa rate sebaka seo.
That trend continues today.	Mokhoa oo o ntse o tsoela pele ho fihlela kajeno.
I never thought of that.	Ha ke eso nahane ka seo.
However, we must trust and trust.	Leha ho le joalo, re tlameha ho tšepa le ho tšepa.
I don’t think it could be easier than that.	Ha ke nahane hore e ka ba bonolo ho feta moo.
But make sure you know what you are doing and why.	Empa etsa bonnete ba hore u tseba seo u se etsang le hore na ke hobane'ng.
We used to be a team.	Re kile ra ba sehlopha.
He did not want to talk about it.	O ne a sa batle ho bua ka eona.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
For a long time nothing happened.	Ka nako e telele ho se letho le etsahalang.
They would win and they would be very happy.	Ba ne ba tla hlola mme ba thabile haholo.
I too do not understand a new question.	Le 'na ha ke utloisise potso e ncha.
You don't even have to say that.	Ha ho hlokahale le ho bua joalo.
You call home to see how your wife and family are doing.	U letsa hae ho tla sheba hore na mosali oa hau le lelapa la hau na ba joang.
They say they made a mistake.	Ba re ba entse phoso.
And that is fun.	Mme hoo ho monate.
I knew he was coming.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o tla tla.
But it’s a lot more than that too.	Empa e batla e le ngata ho feta moo hape.
I found another way.	Ke fumane tsela e 'ngoe.
We should be afraid that we can be you.	Re lokela ho tšaba hore re ka ba uena.
I just thought.	Ke ile ka nahana feela.
He would have to give them a reason.	O ne a tla lokela ho ba fa lebaka.
She looked like my wife.	E ne e shebahala joaloka mosali oa ka.
You don't want to be anywhere near tonight.	Ha u batle ho ba kae kapa kae haufi le moo bosiung bona.
I did a great job.	Ke entse mosebetsi o moholo.
I don't want to read what they have to say about us.	Ha ke batle ho bala seo ba se buang ka rona.
We will fix something.	Re tla lokisa ho hong.
I can't find it.	Ha ke e fumane.
It had taken all the time for dinner, and until they retired.	E ne e nkile nako eohle ea lijo tsa mantsiboea, le ho fihlela ba tlohela mosebetsi.
You can tell by looking at him.	U ka tseba ka ho mo sheba feela.
Nobody is going to do our job for us.	Ha ho motho ea tla re etsetsa mosebetsi oa rona.
This is not dangerous.	Sena ha se kotsi.
I will love you whether you like it or not.	Ke tla o rata kapa o sa rate.
You pay first.	U lefa pele.
It's your turn now.	Ke nako ea hau joale.
I don’t think they’ll win the whole thing.	Ha ke nahane hore ba tla hlola ntho eo kaofela.
They will tell you how to make them love you.	Ba tla u bolella mokhoa oa ho etsa hore ba u rate.
He could have taken it.	A ka be a e nkile.
You can walk all night.	U ka tsamaea bosiu kaofela.
However, this is clearly not the only problem area.	Leha ho le joalo, ho hlakile hore sena hase sona feela sebaka sa bothata.
It was.	E bile.
But that is happening.	Empa seo sea etsahala.
You eat it.	U e ja.
Earn money.	Fumana chelete.
This was very fun.	Sena se ne se le monate haholo.
And that's not what it is.	Mme ha se seo e leng sona.
He does not speak.	Ha a bue.
I think you should go with me.	Ke nahana hore u lokela ho tsamaea le 'na.
Always look for the good.	Kamehla batla se molemo.
Of his children.	Ea bana ba hae.
Of course now it is not so fun.	Ha e le hantle hona joale ha e monate hakaalo.
Life was much easier now.	Bophelo bo ne bo se bo le bonolo haholo joale.
He may have tried something sometime.	E ka ’na eaba o kile a leka ho hong ka nako e ’ngoe.
I don't think anyone can !.	Ha ke nahane hore ho na le motho ea ka khonang!.
I looked at them.	Ke ile ka li sheba.
She wanted her baby every day for years.	O ile a batla ngoana oa hae letsatsi le leng le le leng ka lilemo.
Anyone now.	Leha e le mang hona joale.
These were dangerous times.	Tsena e ne e le linako tse kotsi.
So we do not understand it.	Kahoo ha re e utloisise.
Night is coming, when no one will be able to work.	Bosiu bo a tla, boo ho seng motho ea tla khona ho sebetsa.
He had a chance.	O bile le monyetla.
To the young man.	Ho mohlankana.
But if so, she did not believe it.	Empa haeba ho joalo, ha aa ka a lumela.
We certainly are.	Ka sebele re joalo.
It's hard to believe.	Ho thata ho lumela.
We will be fine.	Re tla phela hantle.
She gave him the boy's clothes.	A mo fa liaparo tsa moshanyana.
There were no children.	Ho ne ho se na bana.
There is nothing to be afraid of.	Ha ho letho leo re lokelang ho le tšaba.
He admitted it was a bad thing to do.	O ile a lumela hore ke ntho e mpe ho e etsa.
People are not like that.	Batho ha ba joalo.
It has to go looking for problems.	E tlameha ho ea batla mathata.
He slept only a few hours last night.	O ile a robala lihora tse 'maloa feela bosiung bo fetileng.
She is absolutely right.	O hantle ruri.
People like you.	Batho ba tšoanang le uena.
In fact, you are second only to him.	Ha e le hantle, u oa bobeli ho eena.
However, most people want to get what they need first.	Leha ho le joalo, batho ba bangata ba batla ho fumana seo ba se hlokang pele.
But he did not get it.	Empa ha a ka a e fumana.
If you have children, you will love them.	Haeba u na le bana, u tla ba rata.
I suggested we stay together.	Ke ile ka etsa tlhahiso ea hore re lule hammoho.
All you can do is say or do something nice.	Seo u ka se etsang feela ke ho bua kapa ho etsa ntho e ntle.
They will know how to fix him.	Ba tla tseba ho mo lokisa.
They spend a lot of time with friends and family.	Ba qeta nako e ngata ba e-na le metsoalle le ba lelapa.
I saw her at the party.	Ke ile ka mo bona moketeng.
There is danger here.	Ho na le kotsi mona.
Swim with them.	Sesa le bona.
I drink.	Kea noa.
I think of my wife and children.	Ke nahana ka mosali oa ka le bana.
They will pay you a lot of money.	Ba tla u lefa chelete e ngata haholo.
I have had only one sorrow.	Ke bile le masoabi a le mong feela.
It wasn’t good, but it was what we would need.	E ne e se ntle, empa e ne e le seo re neng re tla se hloka.
They just didn't want to.	Ba ne ba mpa ba sa batle.
But that is not true.	Empa hoo hase ’nete.
But we can do something about it.	Empa re ka etsa ho hong ka hona.
They were there for us.	Ba ne ba le teng ho rona.
There is truth in what he is saying.	Ho na le 'nete ho seo a se buang.
Just be.	Eba feela.
Easy to read.	Ho bonolo ho bala.
I have to play better going forward.	Ke tlameha ho bapala betere ho ea pele.
But he still has his own.	Empa o ntse a na le ea hae.
However, I do not understand it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke e utloisise.
Because this is our life.	Hobane bona ke bophelo ba rona.
But it will require hard work.	Empa ho tla hloka mosebetsi o boima.
Parents and everyone else.	Batsoali le ba bang kaofela.
Instead, he lets her go.	Ho e-na le hoo, oa mo tlohela hore a tsamaee.
There is no hard time.	Ha ho nako e thata.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
I'm glad to see you again.	Ke thabela ho u bona hape.
I wanted to trust him.	Ke ne ke batla ho mo tšepa.
Think about what he knows.	Nahana ka seo a se tsebang.
You would not want to be there.	U ne u ke ke ua batla ho ba moo.
I was beautiful.	Ke ne ke le motle.
There is no need to go on. 	Ha ho hlokahale ho tsoela pele. 
No, it is not my life without power.	Che, ha se bophelo ba ka bo se nang matla.
First of all, you have to know how to learn to get there.	Taba ea pele, u tlameha ho tseba ho ithuta ho fihla moo.
There is no such thing.	Ha ho letho la mofuta oo.
To my husband, his life was his work with us.	Ho monna oa ka, bophelo ba hae e ne e le mosebetsi oa hae le rona.
At that time.	Ka nako eo.
You're thinking.	U ntse u nahana.
I thought it was a good idea.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke mohopolo o motle.
My baby needs sleep.	Ngoana oa ka o hloka ho robala.
It's still very fun.	Ho ntse ho le monate haholo.
It can provide anything for and very valuable.	E ka fana ka eng kapa eng bakeng sa le ea bohlokoa haholo.
Obviously he has that.	Ho hlakile hore o na le seo.
It is common to ask.	E tloaetse ho botsa.
Those are all difficult questions.	Tseo kaofela ke lipotso tse thata.
Thanks for your help !.	Ke leboha thuso ea hau!.
You get it.	Ua e fumana.
But we have no way of knowing otherwise.	Empa ha re na mokhoa oa ho tseba ka tsela e ’ngoe.
We saw some of them last year.	Re bone tse ling tsa tsona selemong se fetileng.
The team car did just that.	Koloi ea sehlopha e ile ea etsa joalo.
They can be dangerous.	Li ka ba kotsi.
He had never suffered a foot injury before.	O ne a e-s'o ka a utloa bohloko ba maoto pele.
This is not a good thing or a bad thing.	Sena ha se ntho e ntle kapa e mpe.
Some had been in a car accident.	Ba bang ba ne ba bile kotsing ea koloi.
Kopo.	Kopo.
Too much for anyone.	E ngata haholo bakeng sa mang kapa mang.
Something was happening.	Ho ne ho ena le ntho e etsahalang.
And she looks good.	Mme o shebahala hantle.
Tom works hard.	Tom o sebetsa ka thata.
But first he asked how he was going.	Empa pele o ile a botsa hore na o ntse a ea joang.
He was talking very, very well.	O ne a bua haholo, hantle haholo.
I'm a little nervous.	Ke na le maikutlo hanyane.
They saw what you did, you and others.	Ba bone seo o se entseng, wena le ba bang.
He had to work in the morning.	O ne a lokela ho sebetsa hoseng.
There will be a lot of people there.	Ho tla ba le batho ba bangata moo.
Do not do this again.	O seke wa etsa sena hape.
It has to go out to do without a real date.	E tlameha ho tsoa ho etsa ntle le letsatsi la sebele.
Power if we have ever had it.	Matla haeba re kile ra ba le ona.
We had a son.	Re ne re e-na le mora.
Lots of room, anywhere.	Kamore e ngata, kae kapa kae.
He did not want her there.	O ne a sa mo batle moo.
I will work and you go to school.	Ke tla sebetsa mme wena o ya sekolong.
He was not an expert.	E ne e se setsebi.
It has been since then.	Haesale ho tloha ka nako eo.
Of course you know.	Ehlile ua tseba.
Some have time.	Ba bang ba na le nako.
It was too much for one.	E ne e le ngata haholo bakeng sa e le 'ngoe.
Thanks for our help.	Ba leboha thuso ea rona.
It was not his.	E ne e se ba hae.
Then that would not happen.	Joale hoo ho ne ho ke ke ha etsahala.
That was exactly what he did.	E ne e le hantle seo a se entseng.
That can be very difficult to understand.	Seo se ka ba thata haholo ho se utloisisa.
Just once more.	Hang feela hape.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	E ne eka ke mohopolo o motle ka nako eo.
We are no longer human.	Ha re sa le motho.
He went into the room, and there he was.	A kena ka phaposing, mme ke moo a leng teng.
I needed another way to get in.	Ke ne ke hloka tsela e 'ngoe ea ho kena.
And maybe that's what it was.	Mme mohlomong ke seo e neng e le sona.
Lots of past.	Tse ngata tse fetileng.
They talked a lot about you.	Ba ile ba bua haholo ka wena.
This year more than ever.	Selemong sena ho feta neng kapa neng.
I didn't want anyone else.	Ke ne ke sa batle motho e mong.
None of us would do that.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a tla etsa joalo.
And a few books.	Le libuka tse 'maloa.
You will never give up.	Le ka mohla u ke ke ua e tlohela.
They knew nothing about what they were saying.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe letho ka seo ba se buang.
They are too many people.	Ke batho ba bangata haholo.
In fact, it did not take as long as you might think.	Ha e le hantle, ha ea ka ea nka nako e ngata kamoo u ka nahanang kateng.
Even through us.	Leha ka rona.
That's all.	Ke sena feela.
I no longer believe that.	Ha ke sa lumela seo.
That you don’t know what you know.	Hore ha u tsebe hore na ke eng eo u e tsebang.
Just the way.	Tsela feela.
That was it.	E ne e le seo.
We certainly did not do that.	Ka sebele ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
Our team looks bad.	Sehlopha sa rona se shebahala se le mpe.
Time passed quickly.	Nako e ile ea feta kapele.
There is nothing we want.	Ha ho na letho leo re le batlang.
I did not know what to do with them.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke etse eng ka bona.
Without it, a woman is nothing.	Ntle le eona, mosali hase letho.
They asked for directions.	Ba ile ba botsa tsela.
I want to help you get better.	Ke batla ho o thusa hore o be betere.
Maybe there was something to that.	Mohlomong ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ho seo.
Don't talk too much.	U se ke ua bua haholo.
But they can't.	Empa ha ba khone.
Otherwise there was a problem.	Ho seng joalo ho bile le bothata.
Before he died.	Pele a hlokahala.
But we know that they have not.	Empa rea ​​tseba hore ha ba so etse joalo.
It can't always be, somehow.	E ka se be kamehla, ka tsela e itseng.
The ride took several hours.	Ho palama koloi ho ile ha nka lihora tse 'maloa.
So that's the reason.	Kahoo ke lona lebaka.
It had a very interesting feeling in it.	E bile le maikutlo a monate haholo ho eona.
Anyone can make hands.	Mang kapa mang a ka etsa matsoho.
He did not want to think about such things again.	O ne a se a sa batle ho nahana ka lintho tse kang tsena hape.
Mention that work.	Bolela mosebetsi oo.
It was really hard.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le thata.
It is difficult to speak.	Ho bua ho thata.
I was very happy.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo.
It knows the location of each one well.	E tseba sebaka sa e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe hantle.
It was more important to him than his life.	E ne e le taba ea bohlokoa ho eena ho feta bophelo ba hae.
But that is not true.	Empa hase ’nete.
You are right and you just want to help.	O bolela hantle mme o batla ho thusa feela.
It used to be a problem.	E kile ea e-ba bothata.
Come back, and another will take your place.	Khutla, 'me e mong o tla nka sebaka.
It's nothing.	Ha se letho.
He refused to ask for money.	O ile a hana ho kopa chelete.
He looked hard at the boy.	A sheba ka thata ho moshanyana eo.
I want you.	Kea u batla.
We are going to visit him.	Re ea mo etela.
So try.	Kahoo leka.
I really don't.	Ha ke hlile ha ke joalo.
I like school.	Ke rata sekolo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka seo.
They could have been on time.	Ba ka be ba bile nakong.
I am very busy.	Ke phathahane haholo.
It was as if he did not want to hear the truth.	E ne eka ha a batle ho utloa 'nete.
They were definitely better than they were last week.	Ka sebele ba ne ba le betere ho feta kamoo ba neng ba le kateng bekeng e fetileng.
It was his fault that he suffered.	E ne e le molato oa hae hore o utloile bohloko.
Most people believe in the supreme being.	Batho ba bangata ba lumela ho motho ea phahameng ka ho fetisisa.
You have to drive fast.	O lokela ho khanna kapele.
That's right, though, it's my business.	Ke 'nete, leha ho le joalo, ke taba ea ka.
After that, he was alone.	Ka mor'a moo, o ne a le mong.
Some people liked it.	Batho ba bang ba ne ba e rata.
Nice to see you.	Ke thabetse ho o bona.
I didn't have to buy shoes.	Ke ne ke sa tlameha ho reka lieta.
That's why we're here tonight.	Ke ka hona re leng mona bosiung bona.
Why did he reject his proposal?	Ke hobane'ng ha a ile a hana tlhahiso ea hae?
He would need to go to her.	O ne a tla hloka ho ea ho eena.
It's heavy.	E boima.
The rough terrain made it difficult to walk.	Sebaka seo se thata se ne se etsa hore ho be thata ho tsamaea.
I will never see you again or get to know you.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke u bona kapa ho u tseba.
This was beyond him.	Sena se ne se mo feta.
How quickly they forget.	Ba lebala kapele hakae.
But it took a long time to do it.	Empa u nkile nako e telele ho e etsa.
He has a good idea.	O na le mohopolo o motle.
He would get there.	O ne a tla fihla moo.
It will come to me.	E tla tla ho nna.
It can happen again.	E ka etsahala hape.
I am learning.	Ke ntse ke ithuta.
Not a problem at all.	Ha se bothata ho hang.
No one seemed to live in it for many years.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ha ho motho ea kileng a lula ho eona ka lilemo tse ngata.
Be very careful.	Hlokomela haholo.
So it goes on.	Kahoo e tsoela pele.
He looked at it intently.	O ile a e sheba ka hloko.
Then we continue for hours, hours and hours.	Ebe re tsoela pele ka lihora tse telele, tse telele le lihora tse telele.
There is no way to do that.	Ha ho mokhoa o etsang joalo.
But it's very fun.	Empa e monate haholo.
More than he wants.	Ho feta kamoo a batlang.
I want to.	Ke batla ho.
Everyone had it.	E mong le e mong o ne a e-na le eona.
I would need help like that.	Ke ne ke tla hloka thuso joalo.
This comes down to me.	Sena se fihla ho 'na.
You feel that way right away.	U na le maikutlo a joalo hang hang.
They are children.	Ke bana.
We wish it had not happened.	Re lakatsa eka ha hoa etsahala.
It all had to come out.	E ne e tlameha ho tsoa kaofela.
It came to me then.	E ile ea tla ho 'na ka nako eo.
I'm looking for another one.	Ke ntse ke batla e 'ngoe.
They were trying hard.	Ba ne ba leka ka matla.
I was at home.	Ke ne ke le hae.
But you will take it.	Empa u tla e nka.
He certainly did.	Ka sebele o ile a etsa joalo.
That was your job.	Oo e ne e le mosebetsi wa hao.
However, there was one thing they found.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le ntho e le 'ngoe eo ba ileng ba e fumana.
Understanding it is almost as difficult.	Ho e utloisisa ho batla ho le thata joalo.
He could hear them.	O ne a khona ho li utloa.
Money can earn you a lot.	Chelete e ka u fumana haholo.
I will make you money.	Ke tla u etsetsa chelete.
They wrote down their thoughts.	Ba ile ba ngola maikutlo a bona fatše.
He is great.	O moholo.
And I did so.	Mme ka etsa jwalo.
He looked at me.	A sheba ho nna.
We will be alone.	Re tla be re le bang re le bang.
But he did not know everything.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe tsohle.
Never say that.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua bua joalo.
Maybe he had it.	Mohlomong o ne a e-na le eona.
And, they seem to be doing that again.	Mme, ho bonahala eka ba etsa seo hape.
This can be a bad thing.	Sena e ka ba ntho e mpe.
It's fun to play.	Ho monate ho bapala.
It made me see that for the first time.	E entse hore ke bone tseo ka lekhetlo la pele.
Yes, and yet it is not.	Ho joalo, leha ho le joalo ha ho joalo.
Let's talk about it soon.	Ha re bue haufinyane.
Thank you all.	Ke ba leboha kaofela.
I want you to have the opportunity to go back.	Ke batla hore u be le monyetla oa ho khutlela morao.
Nothing seemed to happen.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se letho le etsahetseng.
New.	E ncha.
And he loved that kind.	Mme o ne a rata mofuta oo.
I'm too late for that now.	Ke morao haholo bakeng sa seo jwale.
There would be problems.	Ho ne ho tla ba le mathata.
We are in it together.	Re ho eona hammoho.
That will not work.	Seo se ke ke sa sebetsa.
These are not new.	Tsena ha li ncha.
He opened the door when he got there.	O ile a bula lemati ha a fihla moo.
They will not work.	Ba ke ke ba sebetsa.
Maybe he would keep talking to me.	Mohlomong o ne a tla tsoela pele ho bua le 'na.
He can still take the place.	O ntse a ka nka sebaka.
My father, too, could not, and he was in it.	Ntate le eena o ne a sa khone, 'me o ne a le ho eona.
By their nature.	Ka mofuta oa bona.
It was the most important thing my mother had.	Ke ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa eo ’Mè a neng a e-na le eona.
I love you and will always love you.	Kea u rata 'me ke tla u rata kamehla.
It will be fun to take a closer look at it.	Ho tla ba monate ho sheba haholoanyane ho eona.
Do some of them next year.	Etsa tse ling tsa tsona selemong se tlang.
If not, wait until he does.	Haeba ho se joalo, ema ho fihlela a etsa joalo.
You will never have to go out.	Ha ho mohla u tla tlameha ho tsoa.
Only this week !.	Feela bekeng ena!.
That is what we did.	Ke sona seo re ileng ra se etsa.
But it was very clear.	Empa ho ne ho hlakile haholo.
She looked very pretty.	O ne a bonahala a le motle haholo.
What was he doing.	O ne a etsa eng.
You have to play it to believe it.	U tlameha ho e bapala ho e lumela.
I do not want to know.	Ha ke batle ho tseba.
He tells me this by taking it.	O mpolella sena ka ho e nka.
Some are not.	Ba bang ha ba joalo.
And she was beautiful.	Mme o ne a le motle.
That's how great you are.	Ke kamoo o leng moholo kateng.
So I did.	Kahoo ke ile ka etsa joalo.
But there are problems here.	Empa ho na le mathata mona.
And we both love you more than ever.	'Me ka bobeli re u rata ho feta pele.
Still, she did what she could to help him.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a etsa sohle seo a ka se khonang ho mo thusa.
If you were to be arrested soon, it would be hard.	Haeba u ne u ka tšoaroa haufinyane, ho ne ho le thata.
It should be easy to open it.	E lokela ho ba bonolo ho e bula.
That's how it felt.	Ke kamoo e neng e ikutloa kateng.
We have no way of knowing about his condition.	Ha re na mokhoa oa ho tseba ka boemo ba hae.
They will probably understand something.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe ba tla utloisisa ho hong.
I wonder where it came from.	Kea ipotsa hore na e tsoa kae.
Somehow, it would be.	Ka tsela e itseng, ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
I'm still not sure how.	Ke ntse ke sa tsebe hantle hore na joang.
And we got a chance to say it.	Mme re fumane monyetla wa ho e bolela.
It wasn't even the same type.	E ne e bile e se mofuta o le mong.
It was held without error.	E ile ea tšoaroa ha ho phoso.
Then do it again.	Ebe u e etsa hape.
Now look at what you did.	Joale sheba seo u se entseng.
Because of the lack of children.	Ka lebaka la ho se be le bana.
That can do it.	Seo se ka e etsa.
It’s my way of getting back to him.	Ke mokhoa oa ka oa ho khutlela ho eena.
Basically we do what everyone else does.	Ha e le hantle re etsa seo motho e mong le e mong a se etsang.
That was dangerous.	Seo se ne se le kotsi.
It would not take much.	E ne e ke ke ea nka haholo.
I do not want.	ha ke batle.
Because he had done this before.	Hobane o ne a ile a etsa sena pele.
I'm sorry about what you are.	Ke masoabi ka seo u leng ho sona.
He works very hard.	O sebetsa ka thata haholo.
Now you know more than this new thing.	Hona joale o tseba ho feta ntho ena e ncha.
He decided to buy it.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho e reka.
However, he did not care.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa tsotelle.
They sang together.	O ile a bina hammoho.
But to us he is only a man and children.	Empa ho rona ke monna le bana feela.
It still works.	E ntse e sebetsa.
To do it quickly was.	Ho e etsa kapele e ne e le.
However, there was something else.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le ho hong.
Because you love to help others learn.	Hobane u rata ho thusa ba bang ho ithuta.
I'm not the only one who has had this experience.	Ha se 'na feela eo sena se etsahetseng ho eena.
It was as if they had no money at all.	E ne eka ha ba na chelete ho hang.
The boy's name.	Lebitso la moshanyana.
Yet there was something about him.	Leha ho le joalo ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ka eena.
To me it was only the last one that was missing.	Ho ’na ke ea ho qetela feela e neng e le sieo.
I never thought it would be so difficult.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore ho tla ba thata hakaalo.
You're very nice.	O hantle haholo.
Wait a minute!	Ema hanyane!
And finally we did.	Mme qetellong re ile ra etsa jwalo.
It just feels like me.	E ikutloa joalo ka 'na feela.
Talk to someone.	Bua le motho.
They can't take it.	Ba ke ke ba e nka.
There are no clothes.	Ha ho na liaparo.
In time, things will get worse.	Ha nako e ntse e ea, lintho li tla ba mpe haholo.
Too much here.	E ngata haholo mona.
A little.	Ho se hokae.
It is a good idea to get these things.	Ke mohopolo o motle ho fumana lintho tsena.
I had to look for him at his home.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho mo batla ha hae.
I see that now.	Ke bona seo ha jwale.
Now here's the strange thing.	Jwale ntho e makatsang ke ena.
But leave that boy alone.	Empa tlohela moshanyana eo.
What he knew was that it was real.	Seo a neng a se tseba ke hore ke ntho ea sebele.
They work all the time.	Ba sebetsa kamehla.
That's not the reason you're here.	Ha se lebaka leo o leng ka mona.
They would not be able to make money any other way.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba khona ho etsa chelete ka tsela e 'ngoe.
If you leave now, you will be there in the evening.	Haeba u tsamaea hona joale, u tla fihla moo mantsiboea.
It really makes you stronger.	E hlile e etsa hore o be matla.
Thank you.	Kea leboha.
It is what it is.	Ke seo e leng sona.
To this day we continue to do so.	Ho fihlela kajeno re ntse re etsa joalo.
Maybe he fixed the whole thing.	Mohlomong o ile a lokisa taba eo kaofela.
He wanted her to say something, whatever.	O ne a batla hore a bue ho hong, eng kapa eng.
It is true that my husband is good to me.	Ke 'nete hore monna oa ka o molemo ho 'na.
It's just that we.	Ke feela hore re.
He loved to travel.	O ne a rata ho tsamaea.
No, of course not!	Che, ha e le hantle, ba etsa joalo.
The matter is still pending.	Taba eo e ntse e emetse.
I don't have to tell you what this can mean.	Ha ke a tlameha ho o bolella hore na sena se ka bolela eng.
So maybe there is something in it.	Kahoo mohlomong ho na le ho hong ho eona.
It is as he did.	Ho joalo ka ha a entse.
It was very difficult to leave.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo ho tloha.
But it was actually very good.	Empa ha e le hantle e ne e le ntle haholo.
We didn't have to do anything.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale hore re etse letho.
I told you before.	Ke le boleletse pele.
I try to.	Ke leka ho.
Thank you both very much !.	Ke leboha ka bobeli haholo!.
He would not do such a thing.	O ne a ke ke a etsa ntho e jwalo.
I will swim back to you soon.	Ke tla sesa ho khutlela ho uena haufinyane.
I do it every day.	Ke e etsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
Back to work.	Khutlela mosebetsing.
I caught it.	Ke ile ka tšoara.
After that, she left.	Ka mor’a moo, o ile a tsamaea.
They are arrested.	Ba tšoaroa.
I like these things.	Ke rata lintho tsena.
There have been some very difficult times, too.	Ho bile le linako tse thata haholo, hape.
We must get help.	Re tlameha ho fumana thuso.
Some of them lived a normal life.	Ba bang ba bona ba ne ba phela ka mokhoa.
Nothing like this had ever happened before.	Ho ne ho se ntho e kang ena e kileng ea etsahala pele.
I was very busy at work today.	Ke ne ke phathahane haholo mosebetsing kajeno.
However, it did not matter.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se taba.
He looked at another man.	A sheba monna e mong hape e mong.
Yours is very good.	Ea hau e ntle haholo.
He has been a sweet boy all his life.	Esale e le moshanyana ya monate bophelo bohle ba hae.
It goes both ways.	E tsamaea ka bobeli.
I could not keep them.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho li boloka.
I understand time.	Ke utloisisa nako.
Our parents are often away from home after school.	Hangata batsoali ba rōna ha ba eo hae ka mor'a sekolo.
He always says that.	O bolela seo kamehla.
They hear questions, they wonder.	Ba utloa lipotso, baa ipotsa.
Yet this could not have been more true.	Leha ho le joalo sena e ne e ke ke ea e-ba 'nete ho feta moo.
We want to make sure we keep everyone together.	Re batla ho etsa bonnete ba hore re boloka bohle re le hammoho.
Do not ask why they are not leaving.	U se ke ua botsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba sa tsamaee.
Things that happen.	Lintho tse etsahalang.
Maybe they don't have a lot of money.	Mohlomong ha ba na chelete e ngata.
I'm happy tonight.	Ke thabetse bosiung bona.
He spoke again.	A bua hape.
Get out of here.	Tloha mona.
Good even with water.	E ntle le ka metsi.
But we need help.	Empa re hloka ho fumana thuso.
Always try to do all you can.	Kamehla leka ho etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang.
I think you have met him before.	Ke nahana hore u kile ua kopana le eena pele.
This is something you should not forget.	Sena ke ntho eo u sa lokelang ho e lebala.
That is where we are.	Ke hona moo re leng teng.
But there is no reason.	Empa ha ho na lebaka.
One day, it went on.	Ka letsatsi le leng, e ile ea tsoela pele.
The latter is as difficult as the first simple.	Ea ho qetela e thata joaloka ea pele e bonolo.
To me, one thing is for sure.	Ho 'na, ntho e le' ngoe ke 'nete.
So, why should we study?	Joale, ke hobane’ng ha re lokela ho ithuta?
No need to talk too long.	Ha ho hlokahale ho bua nako e telele.
He needs to do that.	O hloka ho etsa joalo.
They were not in the right place.	Ba ne ba se sebakeng se lekaneng.
We are the only way out.	Re tsela feela ea ho tloha.
However, sometimes it is not so easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ka linako tse ling ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
I know it doesn't matter.	Kea tseba hore ha ho na taba.
The man did not even try.	Monna eo ha a ka a leka le ho mo leka.
We were tired.	Re ne re khathetse.
Thank you so much for your help.	Ke leboha haholo ka thuso ea hau.
I did nothing wrong.	Ha kea etsa letho le phoso.
Maybe for hours.	Mohlomong ka lihora tse ngata.
So obviously this is not enough.	Kahoo ho hlakile hore sena ha sea lekana.
Why my.	Hobaneng a ka .
My family is good.	Lelapa la ka le molemo.
Things are not so simple.	Lintho ha li bonolo hakaalo.
And it's bad for everyone.	Mme e mpe ho bohle.
It seemed like a strange question.	E ne eka ke potso e makatsang.
But that is not what you think it is.	Empa ha se seo o nahanang hore ke sona.
Friends we make.	Metsoalle eo re e etsang.
Or it may seem trivial.	Kapa ho ka bonahala ho se letho.
We did it.	Re e entse.
You did not want him to be alone.	O ne o sa batle hore a be mong.
He drank too much coffee.	O ne a noa kofi e ngata haholo.
There is no danger.	Haho kotsi.
They were close to meeting.	Ba ne ba le haufi le ho kopana.
I wish we could know it by then.	Ke lakatsa eka re ka e tseba ka nako eo.
It should be able to accommodate more people.	E lokela ho khona ho lula batho ba bangata.
But well with me.	Empa hantle le nna.
When you win, say nothing.	Ha u hlola, u se ke ua bua letho.
And now no one wants to look.	'Me joale ha ho motho ea batlang ho sheba.
No, it can happen to anyone.	Che, ho ka etsahala ho mang kapa mang.
He didn't look very tired.	O ne a sa bonahale a khathetse haholo.
Many things can happen at that time.	Ho ka etsahala lintho tse ngata nakong eo.
Good for you.	Ke hantle bakeng sa hau.
We need to fix this.	Re hloka ho lokisa taba ena.
In fact, that's where he got his first one.	Ha e le hantle, ke hona moo a ileng a fumana ea hae ea pele.
And we can fix it.	Mme re ka e lokisa.
And it seems to be one of the most powerful.	'Me e bonahala e le e' ngoe ea tse matla ka ho fetisisa.
Whether that continues will be seen.	Hore na seo se tsoela pele ho tla bonahala.
It was a lot of money.	E ne e le chelete e ngata haholo.
I don't want to do anything.	Ha ke batle ho etsa letho.
I don't care.	Ha ke tsotelle.
I can no longer do that.	Ha ke sa khona ho etsa joalo.
They are not real.	Ha se tsa sebele.
There is no need to fix things.	Ha ho hlokahale ho lokisa lintho.
And some did not.	Le ba bang ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
He was finally coming home.	Qetellong o ne a tla hae.
It was your idea.	E ne e le mohopolo wa hao.
Please have your picture taken.	Ke kopa o be le setšoantšo sa hau.
We will be there.	Re tla ba teng.
There was nothing at all.	Ho ne ho se letho ho hang.
Any help will be very helpful.	Thuso efe kapa efe e tla ba molemo haholo.
His mind was clear too.	Kelello ea hae le eona e ne e hlakile.
We are writing every day.	Re ntse re ngola letsatsi le leng le le leng.
He was just.	O ne a mpa feela.
Every house has a telephone line.	Ntlo e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le mohala oa mohala.
He left to do it.	O ile a tloha ho e etsa.
I had to look.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho sheba.
Or see.	Kapa bona.
There was a car accident.	Ho bile le kotsi ea koloi.
It was coming tonight.	E ne e tla bosiung bona.
Children's playroom.	Kamore ea ho bapala ea bana.
It comes to me.	E tla ho nna.
I'm sorry about that !.	Ke masoabi ka seo!.
He was wearing nice clothes.	O ne a apere liaparo tse ntle.
All will stand.	Bohle ba tla ema.
It was our job to be like that.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa rona ho ba joalo.
Get life, will you!	Fumana bophelo, na u tla!
They have none of their own.	Ha ba na ea bona.
That's a good job.	Ke mosebetsi o motle oo.
The team arrives here.	Sehlopha se fihla mona.
I've been here.	Ke bile mona.
I cried a lot.	Ke ile ka lla haholo.
This is not exactly the case.	Sena ha se joalo hantle.
I need your strength.	Ke hloka matla a hao.
They became close friends.	E ile ea e-ba metsoalle e haufi.
There was no boy.	Ho ne ho se na moshanyana.
Maybe there is something we can do.	Mohlomong ho na le seo re ka se etsang.
It can only be dangerous.	E ka ba kotsi feela.
So you would not think so.	Kahoo u ke ke ua nahana joalo.
Do not make that mistake.	O seke wa etsa phoso eo.
The work has also been great.	Mosebetsi le ona o bile moholo.
It was never his idea.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba maikutlo a hae.
Then they started to arrest us.	Eaba ba qala ho re tšoara.
I don't think you should be here.	Ke nahana hore ha oa lokela ho ba mona.
He didn't think it right.	O ne a sa e nahana hantle.
I have to tell you something.	Ke lokela ho o bolella ho hong.
I did just that.	Ke ile ka etsa joalo.
And again in time.	Mme hape ka nako.
Yes, you think.	E, u nahane.
Which would be nice.	E leng ho ka ba molemo.
They knew him well.	Ba ne ba mo tseba hantle.
They do it because the job requires it.	Ba e etsa hobane mosebetsi o e hloka.
Can you see the error?	A na u ka bona phoso?
We had a great time together.	Re bile le nako e monate hammoho.
So that they no longer exist.	E le hore ba se ke ba hlola ba e-ba teng.
I tried it that way but I could not do it.	Ke ile ka e leka ka tsela eo empa ha kea khona ho e etsa.
Good thing too.	Ntho e ntle hape.
But they gave up.	Empa ba ile ba e tlohela.
I did not know who he was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke mang.
I am happier than I am now.	Ke thabile ho feta hona joale.
Then you will start to get better.	Joale u tla qala ho fumana lintho tse ntle.
I knew he had it.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o na le eona.
Why would he do such a thing.	Hobaneng a ka etsa ntho e joalo.
What we were is no longer valid.	Seo re neng re le sona ha se sa sebetsa.
But often crying.	Empa hangata ho lla.
He did not deny it.	O ne a sa e hana.
You need to know.	U hloka ho tseba.
I am out of school.	Ke tsoa sekolong.
It was just this.	E ne e le sena feela.
It's easy to give.	Ho bonolo ho fana.
I have a car.	Ke na le koloi.
And well, again.	Mme hantle, hape.
Some children also learn to read and write here.	Bana ba bang le bona ba ithuta ho bala le ho ngola mona.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka seo.
However, he did not say anything.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a ka a bua letho.
We could not turn back.	Ha rea ​​ka ra khona ho khutlela morao.
He was not a man but a woman.	E ne e se monna empa e le mosali.
Tonight is not one of them.	Bosiung bona ha se e 'ngoe ea tsona.
It was the second type and never came back.	E ne e le mofuta oa bobeli 'me ha oa ka oa khutla.
Instead, he went back and forth.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a khutlela morao hape.
I know how you get it.	Kea tseba hore na o fumana joang.
I'll be back one day.	Ke khutla ka letsatsi le leng.
Never.	Le ka mohla ha ho mohla.
And some are.	Mme ba bang ba.
And in just one day.	Le ka letsatsi le le leng feela.
I'm tired.	Ke khathetse.
Plus you can do what you want with this.	Ho feta moo o ka etsa seo o se batlang ka sena.
You have to have money to spend money.	U tlameha ho ba le chelete ho sebelisa chelete.
Because	Hobane
The money came from my father.	Chelete e tsoa ho ntate oa ka.
And something better than nothing.	Mme ho hong ho molemo ho feta letho.
There will be no more.	Ha ho sa tla hlola ho eba teng.
I've called one before.	Ke kile ka letsetsa e 'ngoe pele.
But it's their reason and don't forget it.	Empa ke lebaka la bona mme o seke oa e lebala.
Too many things.	Lintho tse ngata haholo.
Tomorrow will be fun.	Hosane ho tla ba monate.
That should not be the case.	Ha ea lokela ho ba taba hakaalo.
We are eating well now.	Re ja hantle hona joale.
I don't have to love you.	Ha ke a tlameha ho o rata.
And she does it better.	Mme o e etsa betere.
Also, he seemed to be worth anything.	Hape, o ne a bonahala a lekana le ntho leha e le efe.
Some of them could live in an empty space.	Ba bang ba bona ba ne ba ka phela sebakeng se se nang letho.
We are having a great time.	Re etsa nako e monate.
A good idea is a good idea.	Mohopolo o motle ke mohopolo o motle.
I would never do such a thing.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa ntho e joalo.
Or anyone you know.	Kapa mang kapa mang eo u mo tsebang.
We have to work harder.	Re lokela ho sebetsa ka thata ho feta.
I was not expecting to see you again.	Ke ne ke sa lebella ho u bona hape.
Be this way.	Eba ka tsela ena.
Have something good !.	Eba le ntho e ntle!.
The work took several hours.	Mosebetsi oo o ne o nka lihora tse 'maloa.
He was reading my mind.	O ne a bala kelello ea ka.
Why he didn't do it.	Hobaneng a ne a sa e etse.
I don't think we will ever do that.	Ha ke nahane hore re tla ke re etse joalo.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
It really works here.	Ehlile e sebetsa mona.
A few days later he was unable to go to school.	Matsatsi a 'maloa ka mor'a moo o ne a sa khone ho ea sekolong.
First, we need to go back a little bit.	Pele, re hloka ho khutlela morao hanyane.
We don't care.	Ha re tsotelle.
You must have finished breakfast by now.	E tlameha ebe o qetile lijo tsa hoseng hona joale.
The water is clear.	Metsi a hlakile.
I do not understand it.	Ha ke e utloisise.
See picture of a dog.	Bona setšoantšo sa ntja.
It will definitely do it again.	Ka sebele e tla etsa hape.
It was not easy for me.	Ho ne ho se bonolo ho 'na.
But they have always come.	Empa esale ba tla.
It should not be a problem.	Ha ea lokela ho ba bothata.
This was another one.	Ena e ne e le e 'ngoe.
The school is also not in a good location.	Sekolo le sona ha se sebakeng se setle.
I do not know why.	Ha ke tsebe lebaka.
That's exactly what we have.	Ke hantle seo re nang le sona.
Of course, no one else.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho motho e mong.
I did not plan.	Ke ne ke sa rera.
It was time for one to know.	E ne e le nako ea hore motho a tsebe.
I asked if he knew you and he said he knew you.	Ke ile ka botsa hore na oa u tseba eaba oa re oa u tseba.
There was no one else at the time.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong ka nako eo.
They realized that the road was a bit rough.	Ba ile ba hlokomela hore tsela e batla e le mpe.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea rona ea ho leka tsela ea rona.
He takes her hands.	O nka matsoho a hae.
Look at all these books.	Sheba libuka tsena kaofela.
It wanted more, and more came.	E ne e batla tse ling, ’me tse ling tsa tla.
But we know why.	Empa rea ​​tseba hore na ke hobane’ng.
And others too.	Le ba bang hape.
Talk about them.	Bua ka tsona.
I'm the first one tonight.	Ke ea pele bosiung bona.
That's not bad.	Seo ha se mpe.
He knew why he was doing this.	O ne a tseba hore na ke hobane’ng ha a ne a etsa sena.
He wanted to know what was going on.	O ne a batla ho tseba se etsahalang.
I don’t know what it is, but he speaks again.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke eng, empa o bua hape.
It's fun, meeting friends.	Ho monate, ho kopana le metsoalle.
He did not know exactly why.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
It has to be very good though.	E tlameha ho ba hantle haholo leha ho le joalo.
It was not what he wanted, but he would do it then.	E ne e se seo a neng a se batla, empa e ne e tla se etsa ka nako eo.
I want to give you the same opportunity.	Ke batla ho u fa monyetla o tšoanang.
Because you were.	Hobane u ne u le.
He expects that.	O lebeletse seo.
There were many things he did not know about her.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a neng a sa li tsebe ka eena.
That they did not plan further.	Hore ba ne ba sa rera ho feta.
That has been true since childhood.	Ho bile joalo ho tloha e sa le bana.
But you also need to think about what you want.	Empa le uena u nahane ka seo u se batlang.
One of my friends recently passed away, too.	E mong oa metsoalle ea ka o sa tsoa hlokahala, le eena.
I heard about you.	Ke utloile ka uena.
I'm still thinking about it.	Ke ntse ke nahana ka eona.
Empty space.	Sebaka se se nang letho.
Yes, he probably did.	E, mohlomong o ne a e tloaetse.
Maybe he doesn't know who you are.	Mohlomong ha a tsebe hore na u mang.
He did well.	O entse hantle.
Can we leave it at that?	Na re ka e tlohela joalo?
It's three hours.	Ke lihora tse tharo.
He left just as we had left.	O ile a tsamaea ka nako e tšoanang le eo re ileng ra tsamaea ka eona.
You want to help but can't.	U batla ho thusa empa ha u khone.
There were no more of his kind anywhere.	Ho ne ho se ho se na tsa mofuta oa hae kae kapa kae.
Now we were talking about something else.	Joale re ne re bua ka ntho e 'ngoe.
He asked to meet with you.	O ile a kopa ho kopana le uena.
It comes from the back.	E tsoa ka morao.
Do not use them unless you really know what you want to say.	U se ke ua li sebelisa ntle le haeba u hlile u tseba seo u batlang ho se bua.
For years, perhaps.	Ka lilemo, mohlomong.
It helps to know that someone is looking for them.	Hoa thusa ho tseba hore ho na le motho ea ba batlang.
It's easy to do things.	Ho bonolo ho etsa lintho.
Many of us did.	Ba bangata ba rōna re ile ra etsa joalo.
I want to swim more.	Ke batla ho sesa ho feta .
I don't care about that.	Ha ke tsotelle taba ena.
It will stop.	E tla ema.
He did not know who they were, not even one of them.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke mang, leha e le mang oa bona.
It should be a.	E lokela ho ba ho a.
Some thought that was too much.	Ba bang ba ne ba nahana hore seo se ne se le ngata haholo.
You would not have heard this.	U ka be u sa utloa sena.
It takes some work to care for them.	Ho hloka mosebetsi o itseng ho ba hlokomela.
However, thanks for the help.	Leha ho le joalo, ke leboha thuso.
You want to.	U batla ho.
It has been there for three years.	E bile moo ka lilemo tse tharo.
Then decide how you will save it.	Ebe u etsa qeto ea hore na u tla e boloka joang.
Sometimes that’s what you want.	Ka linako tse ling ke seo u se batlang.
Because that's what life is all about.	Hobane ke seo bophelo bo leng sona.
Then he would not be treated like a child.	Joale o ne a ke ke a tšoaroa joaloka ngoana.
We don't know it.	Ha re o tsebe.
He did it as soon as he got home.	O ile a e etsa hang ha a fihla hae.
This was a great opportunity.	Ona e ne e le monyetla o moholo.
Opportunity tried again.	Monyetla o ile a leka hape.
He has no power to love a woman.	Ha a na matla a ho rata mosali.
I would love to hear your thoughts.	Nka thabela ho utloa maikutlo a hau.
It’s not that I don’t want to, I do.	Ha se hore ha ke batle, ke etsa joalo.
Somehow, he had it.	Ka tsela e itseng, o ne a e-na le eona.
He was very helpful.	O ne a thusa haholo.
So the problem remains important.	Kahoo bothata bo ntse bo le bohlokoa.
I have to move on.	Ke tlameha ho tsoela pele.
This is for a reason.	Sena ke ka lebaka.
I will be back soon.	Ke tla khutla haufinyane.
He did not know why he should say anything.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a lokela ho bua letho.
I would like to know.	Nka rata ho tseba.
To most people, he has a mind.	Ho batho ba bangata, o na le kelello.
And he had to tell somebody.	Mme o ne a lokela ho bolella motho e mong.
They proceed with caution.	Ba tsoela pele ka hloko.
The doctor is coming.	Ngaka ea tla .
That was my first thought.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo oa ka oa pele.
If he could go now, he would be alone.	Haeba a ne a ka tsamaea hona joale, a ka be a le mong.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
Only recently, please.	Haufinyane feela, ka kopo.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
Only you.	Ke uena feela.
I felt that way then and now.	Ke ne ke ikutloa joalo nakong eo le hona joale.
I just want to help in some way.	Ke batla feela ho thusa ka tsela e itseng.
I can love.	Ke khona ho rata.
Maybe it was a good idea to tell someone about it.	Mohlomong e ne e le mohopolo o motle ho bolella motho e mong ka eona.
No one knew the truth.	Ho ne ho se motho ea tsebang 'nete.
Taking advantage of his life.	Ho nka monyetla ka bophelo ba hae.
While talking on the phone.	Ha re ntse re bua ka mohala.
You wouldn't know it, though.	O ne o ke ke wa e tseba, leha ho le jwalo.
You do not know everything.	Ha o tsebe tsohle.
There were a lot of kids in it.	Ho ne ho e-na le bana ba bangata ka.
The same people every day in this place.	Batho ba tšoanang letsatsi le letsatsi sebakeng sena.
All the bad things he had carried over the years.	Lintho tsohle tse mpe tseo a neng a li nkile ka lilemo.
This is his.	Sena ke sa hae.
You do this when you are always alone.	U etsa joalo ha esale u lula u le mong.
It's a little certain of his opinion, maybe, and only three.	E na le bonnete hanyane ka maikutlo a hae, mohlomong, le tse tharo feela.
I had to eat.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho ja.
You can write the child's name on it.	U ka ngola lebitso la ngoana ho eona.
And she was just fun.	Mme o ne a le monate feela.
I've seen this before.	Ke bone sena pele.
It is useless or useless.	Ha e na thuso kapa ha e na thuso.
You play it once, you will not play it.	U e bapala hang, ha u na ho e bapala.
I do not need to see a doctor.	Ha ke hloke ho bona ngaka.
Going forward.	Ho ea pele.
But that remains to be seen.	Empa seo se sa ntse se tla bonahala.
It is a dangerous and hard-to-reach place.	Ke sebaka se kotsi le seo ho leng thata ho fihla ho sona.
I did not know his name.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe lebitso la hae.
Get very well.	Fumana hantle haholo.
They spoke before they started eating.	Ba ile ba bua pele ba qala ho ja.
She began to sing happily.	A qala ho bina a thabile.
Maybe I don’t know how it works.	Mohlomong ha ke tsebe hore na e sebetsa joang.
He too heard.	Le eena o ile a utloa.
It is very difficult to do so.	Ho thata haholo ho etsa joalo.
There was something wrong with the situation.	Ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ho phoso ka boemo bona.
I knew exactly what he meant.	Ke ne ke tseba hantle seo a neng a se bolela.
That never happened to me.	Seo ha se sa etsahala ho 'na.
He had a good job.	O bile le mosebetsi o motle.
This will not work.	Sena se ke ke sa sebetsa.
Only we.	Ke rona feela.
We are working.	Re ntse re sebetsa.
Maybe they were just beginning to trust us.	Mohlomong ba ne ba qala ho re tšepa.
It's a very nice place.	Ke sebaka se setle haholo.
The work was hard.	Mosebetsi o ne o le boima.
This can go both ways, too.	Sena se ka tsamaea ka bobeli, hape.
He loved the book.	O ne a rata buka eo.
I tell you without question.	Kea le bolella ntle le ho botsa.
That's the way they lived.	Ke kamoo ba neng ba phela kateng.
They were too many.	Li ne li le ngata haholo.
And he realizes that he is good.	'Me oa hlokomela hore o na le molemo.
Getting back here.	Ho fihla morao mona.
I'll take another one.	Ke tla nka e mong.
I decided to write down some of them.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho ngola tse ling tsa tsona fatše.
That is not good.	Seo ha se setle.
But that is your decision.	Empa ke qeto ya hao.
They can try.	Ba ka leka.
What was it.	E ne e le eng.
He really uses his hands.	O hlile o sebelisa matsoho a hae.
It belonged to someone else.	E ne e le oa motho e mong.
Or second, any.	Kapa ea bobeli, leha e le efe.
But he did not care.	Empa o ne a sa tsotelle.
He really enjoyed it.	E ile ea e thabela haholo.
Up to this point.	Ho fihlela mona.
I did and did a good job.	Ke ile ka etsa joalo 'me ka sebetsa hantle.
Everyone was asking him questions.	Bohle ba ne ba mo botsa lipotso.
He had done it again.	O ne a e entse hape.
These are not important.	Tsena ha se tsa bohlokoa.
They will sing nearby.	Ba tla bina haufi.
It was fun talking to them.	Ho ne ho le monate ho bua le bona.
All you had to do was say that.	Seo u neng u tlameha ho se etsa feela ke ho bua joalo.
Too bad.	E mpe haholo.
Because, he thought, this is the life.	Hobane, a nahana, bona ke bona bophelo.
But they did not read it carefully.	Empa ha baa ka ba e bala ka hloko.
They worked very well together.	Ba ne ba sebetsa hammoho hantle haholo.
We’ve all met his kind.	Kaofela re kopane le mofuta oa hae.
You are an expert.	U setsebi.
I thought they had found him.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ba mo fumane.
I did not go.	Ha kea ka ka tsamaea.
I'm not the one they want.	Ha se nna eo ba mo batlang.
It hurts.	Ho bohloko.
But more than that.	Empa ho feta moo.
I still have them as before.	Ke ntse ke e-na le tsona joaloka pele.
I was just happy.	Ke ne ke thabile feela.
So here it is.	Kahoo le mona.
He made lots of money.	O ne a fumana chelete e ngata.
This food is not good for some.	Lijo tsena ha li monate ho ba bang.
If it wasn't, he probably was there, soon.	Haeba e ne e se, mohlomong o ne a le teng, haufinyane.
What do you want to eat today?	U batla ho ja eng kajeno?
More than that.	Ho feta ka nako eo.
He may well have made that decision.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe o ile a etsa qeto.
He even began to believe that he could live.	O ile a ba a qala ho lumela hore a ka ’na a phela.
I did not know what was going on.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ho etsahala’ng.
Here is the good news.	Litaba tse monate ke tsena.
Maybe now it was time.	Mohlomong joale e ne e le nako.
Some are new.	Tse ling li ncha.
Time goes by tomorrow is another day.	Nako e ea tsamaea hosane ke letsatsi le leng hape.
That is very important.	Seo se bohlokoa haholo.
We are a good team.	Re sehlopha se setle.
I was happy with him.	Ke ne ke thabile le eena.
Think before you speak.	Nahana pele u bua.
That's very true.	Ho joalo haholo.
This place no longer exists.	Sebaka sena ha se sa le teng.
We are here for you.	Re mona bakeng sa hau.
I am very tired.	Ke khathetse haholo.
This is always difficult for me.	Sena se lula se le thata ho 'na.
We do not know why the man did this.	Ha re tsebe hore na ke hobane’ng ha monna eo a ile a etsa joalo.
He always goes out for dinner.	O lula a tsoa bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
It really happened.	E ne e hlile e etsahala.
To say nothing.	Ho bua letho.
She decides to tell him everything.	O etsa qeto ea ho mo bolella ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
He didn't really care.	O ne a sa tsotelle hakaalo.
Now we live here and we need help.	Hona joale re lula mona 'me re hloka thuso.
Travel time.	Nako ea ho tsamaea.
That's the first thing.	Ke ntho ea pele.
That is true.	Seo ke 'nete.
It could not have happened.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha etsahala.
It was the best thing ever.	E ne e le ntho e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
It's your place.	Ke sebaka sa hao.
I did not find them.	Ha kea ka ka li fumana.
So we did our best.	Kahoo, re ile ra etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
Or trying to be.	Kapa ho leka ho ba.
But he is not.	Empa ha a joalo.
It is very strong so make sure you eat a lot.	E matla haholo kahoo etsa bonnete ba hore o ja haholo.
Nor was it opening last night.	Hape e ne e se ho bula bosiung ba maobane.
Check this out.	Sheba ena.
No problem, we say.	Ha ho bothata, re re.
He would never need it again.	O ne a ke ke a hlola a e hloka.
He works long hours.	O sebetsa lihora tse telele.
I will never love another like this.	Ha ke sa tla rata e mong ea kang ena.
That's right! 	Ke 'nete!
But there is a way to do this.	Empa ho na le mokhoa oa ho etsa sena.
It should not happen.	Ha ea lokela ho etsahala.
You can stay here or go home or whatever.	U ka lula mona kapa ua ea hae kapa eng kapa eng.
Maybe he was there.	Mohlomong o ne a le teng.
Someone knew about money.	Ho na le motho ea neng a tseba ka chelete.
This can be dangerous.	Sena se ka ba kotsi.
It could not last long.	E ne e ke ke ea lula nako e telele.
All weight.	Boima bohle.
It doesn't have to be complicated.	Ha ho hlokahale hore e be thata ho feta moo.
You can see it, can you?	U ka e bona, na?
He said yes.	O ile a re ho joalo.
The man was just walking.	Monna eo o ne a tsamaea feela.
Like a new one.	Joalo ka e ncha.
I hope you will come back one day.	Ke tšepa hore u tla khutla ka letsatsi le leng.
She already understood.	O ne a se a ntse a utloisisa.
Too bad.	E mpe haholo.
I've seen that kind before.	Ke bone mofuta oo pele.
Maybe we will.	Mohlomong re tla etsa joalo.
You know, it was almost two.	Ua tseba, e ne e batla e le bobeli.
Strange, weird, weird.	E makatsang, e makatsang, e makatsang.
And what is this? 	Hona ke eng?
Mine is very clear.	Ea ka e hlakile haholo.
he asked.	a botsa.
They've been here for hours.	Ba bile mona ka lihora tse ngata.
The task was very one.	Mosebetsi o ne o le mong haholo.
Some were not talking about others.	Ba bang ba ne ba sa bue ka ba bang.
However, there are some problems with this method.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le mathata a mang ka mokhoa ona.
This is better than the last place, of course.	Sena se molemo ho feta sebaka sa ho qetela, ka 'nete.
Nothing like that was needed.	Ho ne ho se ntho e joalo e neng e hlokahala.
They have to pass.	Ba tlameha ho feta.
I certainly can.	Ka sebele nka khona.
I don't think he will.	Ha ke nahane hore o tla etsa joalo.
I think this is a good idea.	Ke nahana hore ona ke mohopolo o motle.
His.	Tsa hae.
I've been thinking about you.	esale ke nahana ka wena.
He said go, and you went.	O itse tsamaea, 'me ua tsamaea.
He is the Father.	Ke Ntate.
But that was not the case.	Empa taba eo e ne e se eona.
So that gives you a place to start now.	Kahoo seo se u fa sebaka sa ho qala hona joale.
I know you know about us.	Kea tseba hore oa tseba ka rona.
I hope you like them.	Ke tšepa u li rata.
This would not have happened.	Sena se ne se ke ke sa etsahala.
It is better to say yes.	Ho molemo hore u re e.
But some of them do.	Empa ba bang ba bona ba etsa joalo.
This is a mistake, in his opinion.	Ena ke phoso, ka maikutlo a hae.
Just once more.	Hang feela hape.
I see the whole problem.	Ke bona bothata bohle.
We had a lot during that time, too.	Re bile le tse ngata nakong eo, hape.
I will never have such a thing.	Ha ke na ho ba le ntho e joalo.
He knows his name.	O tseba lebitso la hae.
Instead, he sat down and proceeded to make dinner.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a lula fatše ’me a tsoela pele ho etsa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I can talk to them for you.	Nka bua le bona bakeng sa hao.
Not at all.	Ho hang ha ho joalo.
I almost do that.	Ke batla ke etsa joalo.
Not so with humans. 	Ha ho joalo ka batho. 
In fact, it was worse than ever.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le mpe ho feta leha e le neng pele.
This is a good thing.	Ena ke ntho e ntle.
It was nice to meet you.	Ho bile monate ho kopana le wena.
It really does.	E hlile e etsa joalo.
Neither did he.	Le eena ha a ka a etsa joalo.
Best to go fast.	Molemo ka ho fetisisa ho tsamaea kapele.
Do what you want.	Etsa seo u se batlang.
We do not have a dog.	Ha re na ntja.
Plan on it.	Rera ka eona.
I can use help here, he thought to himself.	Nka sebelisa thuso mona, a nahana ho eena.
I do not want to go home.	Ha ke batle ho ea hae.
Too much.	E ngata haholo.
She drove home happy	O ile a khanna hae a thabile
Do you know.	Na u tseba.
Also, note what happened on that occasion.	Hape, hlokomela se ileng sa etsahala ka nako eo.
You had just spent time with them.	U ne u sa tsoa qeta nako le bona.
I also want a name.	Ke batla le lebitso.
I did not expect him to do so.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore a ka etsa joalo.
I eat and sleep thinking only of them.	Kea ja le ho robala ke nahana ka bona feela.
Stay in one place.	Lula sebakeng se le seng.
I don't need anyone else.	Ha ke hloke motho e mong.
Were you not in danger?	Na ha ua ka ua ba kotsing?
He does nothing.	Ha a etse letho.
Every doctor had it.	Ngaka e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e e-na le eona.
That is where he does some good.	Ke hona moo a etsang molemo o itseng.
I enjoy seeing people.	Ke thabela ho bona batho.
And it will happen soon.	Mme e tla etsahala haufinyane.
So it's not the same thing.	Ka hona ha se ntho e tšoanang.
One does not know.	Motho ha a tsebe.
That he did something wrong.	Hore ebe o entse ntho e mpe.
It was not how they decided to play it.	E ne e se kamoo ba entseng qeto ea ho e bapala.
Open only for dinner.	Bula lijo tsa mantsiboea feela.
The water that was there had a name.	Metsi a neng a le teng a ne a na le lebitso.
Nobody knew them.	Ho ne ho se motho ya ba tsebang.
I was at work.	Ke ne ke le mosebetsing.
It's nice to be able to get out of it.	Ho monate ho khona ho tloha ho eona.
Thank you all for the wonderful comment.	Ke leboha bohle ka maikutlo a makatsang.
It is the best of all.	E ntle ho tsohle.
We can no longer save time.	Ha re sa khona ho boloka nako.
It is better to be alone.	Ho molemo hore a lule a le mong.
However, she had never asked him about them.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a e-s’o ka a mo botsa ka tsona.
Because it is coming.	Hobane e ea tla.
It was strange to say the least.	E bile ntho e makatsang ho bua hanyane.
But no one should have known that.	Empa ha ho motho ea neng a lokela ho tseba seo.
I never thought about it.	Ha kea ka ka nahana ka eona.
Then you get a head.	Ebe u fumana hlooho.
But he is making things even more difficult this week.	Empa o etsa hore lintho li be thata haholo bekeng ena.
Will this allow you.	Na sena se tla u lumella.
They are very good.	Li ntle haholo.
I studied from evening until morning.	Ke ile ka ithuta ho tloha mantsiboea ho fihlela hoseng.
It is the same question.	Ke potso e tšoanang.
Except most people don't know.	Ntle le hore batho ba bangata ha ba tsebe.
Think of it as weird.	E nahane e le ntho e makatsang.
Otherwise, you may not do my job.	Ho seng joalo, u ka 'na ua se ke ua etsa mosebetsi oa ka.
They are all the same age as me.	Bohle baa lekana le nna.
It was certainly not easy.	Ka sebele ho ne ho se bonolo.
Think of his mother.	Nahana ka 'mè oa hae.
It looks like that.	E shebahala joalo.
She approached the young man first.	O ile a ea ho mohlankana eo pele.
But it is next week.	Empa ke bekeng e tlang.
He said that was a very good idea.	A re eo ke mohopolo o motle ruri.
We just have to look.	Re tlameha feela ho sheba.
I wanted to stay strong for him.	Ke ne ke batla ho lula ke le matla bakeng sa hae.
Of course you can go to school.	Ehlile u ka ea sekolong.
We do not seek help from you or anyone else.	Ha re batle thuso ho uena kapa ho mang kapa mang.
It will be powerful.	E tla ba le matla.
Yet they are empty.	Leha ho le joalo ha li na letho.
Every family should have this.	Lelapa le leng le le leng le lokela ho ba le sena.
It works well, it only lasts a long time.	E sebetsa hantle, e nka nako e telele feela.
To know you a little bit.	Ho o tseba hanyane.
These things take a lot of time.	Lintho tsena li nka nako e ngata.
There is absolutely no reason.	Ho hang ha ho na lebaka.
If they are too many, then it means something is happening.	Ha li le ngata haholo, joale ho bolela hore ho na le ntho e etsahalang.
They loved it all.	Ba ne ba rata bohle.
I do not know what to say.	Ha ke tsebe seo nka se buang.
He could not trust her.	O ne a sitoa ho mo tšepa.
The school children had fun with him.	Bana ba sekolo ba ne ba le monate le eena.
I will go.	Ke tla tsamaea.
But then they worked well together.	Empa joale ba ne ba sebetsa hammoho hantle.
They were not friends.	E ne e se metsoalle.
You were the only one who was not in this.	Ke uena feela ea neng a le sieo ho ena.
I did not want to give it to her.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho mo fa eona.
Both can be careless at the same time.	Ka bobeli e ka ba ho se tsotelle ka nako e le 'ngoe.
It's not me, she thought.	Ha se 'na, a nahana joalo.
So we can be better.	Kahoo re ka ba betere.
And there is still plenty of time for that to pass.	Mme ho sa na le nako e ngata bakeng sa ho feta.
They have done this before.	Ba kile ba etsa sena pele.
It was so hard.	Ho ne ho le thata joalo.
Thank you very much.	Ke leboha haholo.
Wait a minute!	Ema hanyane!
He does not have much money.	Ha a na chelete e ngata.
I just let them go again.	Ke ile ka li lumella feela hape.
I don't understand why they would do that.	Ha ke utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba ka etsa joalo.
This is what is going to happen.	Sena ke se tlang ho etsahala.
So, "What is dinner?" 	Kahoo, "ho ja lijo tsa mantsiboea ke eng?"
he asked.	a botsa.
Maybe that's the reason.	Mohlomong ke lona lebaka.
They are both at the same time.	Ke bobeli ka nako e le 'ngoe.
That would be a form of betrayal.	Hoo e ka ba mofuta oa ho eka.
He just wants to play with me.	O batla ho bapala le nna feela.
And my news is there.	Le litaba tsa ka li teng.
Amazing things happen to everyone.	Lintho tse makatsang li etsahala ho motho e mong le e mong.
I was working here you know.	Ke ne ke sebetsa mona oa tseba.
I thought the situation required that.	Ke ne ke nahana hore boemo bo hloka seo.
He is still in danger.	O ntse a le kotsing.
He seems to be coming out at some point.	Ho bonahala eka o tsoa nakong e 'ngoe.
You do not have to be friends with them.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u be metsoalle le bona.
Man, it was beautiful.	Monna, e ne e le ntle.
I did not understand why she would refuse.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hore na ke hobane’ng ha a ne a ka hana.
By day, day by day.	Ka letsatsi, letsatsi.
He had nothing to say.	O ne a se na letho leo a ka le buang.
He has to go home.	O lokela ho khutlela hae.
They really took it.	Ba e nkile ehlile.
And we must do something for your name.	Mme re tlameha ho etsa ho hong ka lebitso la hao.
Many had not eaten for a week.	Ba bangata ba ne ba e-s’o je ka mor’a beke.
Make sure you know.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u tseba.
I have always disliked him.	Haesale ke sa mo rate.
I'll let you go, if you wish.	Ke tla o tlohela, ha o lakatsa.
Nothing mattered.	Ho ne ho se letho le bohlokoa.
That's all you ever wanted a woman to be.	Ke sohle seo o kileng oa batla hore mosali a be sona.
He knew what he could do to his father.	O ne a tseba seo a ka se etsang ho ntate oa hae.
Most of us are not.	Ba bangata ba rōna ha ba joalo.
You don't want to look too strong, do you?	Ha u batle ho shebahala u le matla haholo, na ha ho joalo?
Maybe it's not just money.	Mohlomong ha se chelete feela.
That is what the law requires.	Ke seo molao o se hlokang.
Clearly, there is something wrong.	Ho hlakile hore ho na le phoso.
That's it.	Ke sona seo.
I am better than these bad ones.	Ke betere ho feta tsena tse mpe.
That means you will eventually get to see them.	Ho bolela hore qetellong u tla fumana ho ba bona.
It was just that.	Ho ne ho le joalo feela.
That alone is not the whole truth.	Ke eona feela eo e seng 'nete eohle.
They too need to be present.	Le bona ba hloka ho ba teng.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
That's it for us.	Ke eona bakeng sa rona.
While the child is weeping,	Ha ngoana a ntse a lla,
And it was a wonderful night.	Mme e ne e le bosiu bo monate.
I no longer need friends.	Ha ke sa hloka metsoalle.
But, no one knows what would happen.	Empa, ha ho motho ea tsebang se neng se tla etsahala.
I can do that, you know.	Nka etsa seo, o ya tseba.
That is very important to me.	Seo se bohlokoa haholo ho 'na.
Look at what happened to my family.	Sheba se etsahetseng ka lelapa la ka.
He really thought things were going well with him.	O ne a hlile a nahana hore lintho li tsamaea hantle le eena.
They wanted to spend the rest of their lives together.	Ba ne ba batla ho qeta bophelo bohle ba bona hammoho.
Think about things.	Nahana ka lintho.
He said yes, but no.	O ile a re e, empa che.
You need a way to meet it.	U hloka mokhoa oa ho kopana le eona.
I did not expect to see them.	Ke ne ke sa lebella ho ba bona.
You don't have to say it until you want to say it.	Ha o a tlameha ho bolela ho fihlela o batla ho bolela.
I can't get over this anymore.	Ha ke khone ho feta ho sena hape.
That is a very strange question.	Ke potso e makatsang haholo.
Then he got it.	Eaba oa e fumana.
The old days.	Matsatsi a khale.
He liked to go fast.	O ne a rata ho tsamaea kapele.
I thought he had it.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o ne a e-na le eona.
Dinner was a feast!	Lijo tsa mantsiboea e ne e le mokete!
It was like tonight.	Ho bile jwalo bosiung bona.
Think about it.	Nahana ka eona.
He needed help.	O ne a hloka ho thusa.
He did not know.	O ne a sa tsebe.
She is a good professional.	Ke setsebi se setle.
Being here with you is not a good idea.	Ho ba mona le uena ha se mohopolo o motle.
You can walk hard.	U ka tsamaea ka thata.
I find out why they want it.	Ke fumana hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba e batla.
Wrong with fun.	Phoso ka monate.
They did not want me to leave.	Ba ne ba sa batle hore ke tsamaee.
Which is not clear.	E leng hore ha e eo ho hlakile.
He knew how important this could be.	O ne a tseba hore na sena e ka ba sa bohlokoa hakae.
Of course, he did not do so alone.	Ha e le hantle, ha aa ka a etsa joalo a le mong.
It's just beautiful.	E ntle feela.
He studied for many years.	O ile a ithuta ka lilemo tse ngata.
It goes fast.	E tsamaea kapele.
I never knew Dad.	Ha ke eso tsebe Ntate.
But nothing.	Empa ha ho letho.
They would study it at any time.	Ba ne ba tla ithuta eona neng kapa neng.
This is what made us human.	Ena ke eona ntho e re entseng batho.
But now, no one is doing that.	Empa joale, ha ho motho ea etsang joalo.
The fact is that no one knows.	'Nete ke hore ha ho motho ea tsebang.
Why did they do this?	Ke hobane’ng ha ba entse see?
It would be nice to go to your place.	Ho ka ba monate ho ea sebakeng sa hau.
She helps and prepares dinner for everyone.	O thusa 'me o etsetsa bohle lijo tsa mantsiboea.
We need time here.	Re hloka nako mona.
And he wanted her.	Mme o ne a mo batla.
More than that it was.	Ho feta moo e ne e le eona.
He never did this.	Ha ho mohla a entseng sena.
It was not even a new aid.	E ne e se leha e le thuso e ncha.
He looks very good.	O shebahala hantle haholo.
Empty weight is.	Boima bo se nang letho ke.
I think about it more than sleeping.	Ke nahana ka eona ho feta ho robala.
How old was he then?	Ka nako eo o ne a le lilemo li kae.
A place for them there.	Sebaka bakeng sa bona moo.
But there is no certainty.	Empa ha ho na bonnete.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke bue hantle.
So now, we want to help them fix it.	Kahoo joale, re batla ho ba thusa ho e lokisa.
The second man was not well.	Monna oa bobeli o ne a sa phela hantle hakaalo.
That is why they are children.	Ke kahoo e leng bana.
Where did that come from?	Seo se ne se tsoa hokae?
He knows he's here.	O a tseba hore o mona.
They did this before.	Ba entse sena pele.
I will ask questions.	Ke tla botsa lipotso.
But neither did they.	Empa le bona ha ba ka ba etsa hoo.
Maybe you should just sleep.	Mohlomong o lokela ho robala feela.
Be exactly the way you are.	Eba hantle kamoo o leng kateng.
Walking down the road was very nice.	Ho tsamaea le tsela e ne e le ntle haholo.
Her mother was in a car accident.	Mme wa hae o ne a le kotsing ya koloi.
I could not go on.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho tsoela pele.
He wanted to learn everything.	O ne a batla ho ithuta ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
There is nothing about that.	Haho letho ka seo.
So, he said, to tell me what it meant.	E le hore, a re, ho mpolella hore na e ne e bolela eng.
Looks like you need one.	Ho bonahala eka o hloka e le 'ngoe.
Telling me when my family knows.	Ho mpolella ha lelapa la ka le tseba.
Take a good look at others.	Sheba le ba bang hantle.
A man who knows you.	Monna ea o tsebang.
And kind of.	Le mofuta oa.
No one is talking about it anymore.	Ha ho sa na motho ea buang ka eona.
Maybe I was beautiful.	Mohlomong ke ne ke le motle.
Now everything is working fine.	Hona joale tsohle li sebetsa hantle.
They will not care if anyone likes it.	Ba ka se tsotelle haeba mang kapa mang a e rata.
They should not have done this.	Ba ne ba sa lokela ho etsa sena.
Sometimes he saw the folly of all this.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a bona ho hloka kelello ha tsena tsohle.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
He was alone in the room at the time.	O ne a le mong ka phaposing ka nako eo.
But it was really pretty.	Empa e ne e hlile e le ntle haholo.
So, what can we do?	Joale, re ka etsa’ng?
It looks really fun.	E shebahala e le monate haholo.
Besides, thank you for reading and having a good one !.	Ka ntle ho moo, kea leboha ha u bala le ho ba le e ntle !.
I wanted to know everything about him.	Ke ne ke batla ho tseba ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe ka eena.
Nobody knows how people will get out of there.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na batho ba tla tsoa joang moo.
He had to go to work.	O ile a tlameha ho ea mosebetsing.
But, that was not the case.	Empa, taba eo e ne e se eona.
But that life is behind me.	Empa bophelo boo bo ka mora ka.
The police are looking forward to seeing you.	Mapolesa a lebeletse ho u bona.
Otherwise it would be fine.	Ho seng joalo ho ka ba hantle.
At this point, however, we need to stop and think again.	Leha ho le joalo, nakong ena, re lokela ho ema 'me re nahane hape.
I know and understand how they feel.	Kea tseba le ho utloisisa hore na ba ikutloa joang.
It should not be a problem for them.	Ha ea lokela ho ba bothata ho bona.
Make it strong.	Etsa hore e be matla.
It will help when things seem difficult, as they will.	E tla thusa ha lintho li bonahala li le boima, joalo ka ha li tla ba joalo.
I mean as it is.	Ke bolela joalo ka ha ho le joalo.
Her parents never thought it would be anything.	Batsoali ba hae le ka mohla ha baa ka ba nahana hore e tla ba ntho leha e le efe.
My career started quickly.	Mosebetsi oa ka o ile oa qala kapele.
It helps when you know they are coming.	Hoa thusa ha o tseba hore ba ea tla.
Yes, you can live with what.	E, u ka phela le eng.
I can't say all the rest.	Ke sitoa ho bolela tse ling kaofela.
I like this style.	Ke rata mokhoa ona.
He looked ahead.	A sheba ka pele.
We had so much fun there and loved our friends.	Re ne re thabile haholo moo ’me re rata metsoalle ea rōna.
So, if there is, use this.	Kahoo, haeba e le teng, sebelisa ena.
And, of course, he wins.	Mme, ehlile, o a hlola.
But, well.	Empa, hantle.
It was late at night.	E ne e se e le bosiu.
However, they too are a problem.	Leha ho le joalo, le bona ke bothata.
It should be so.	E lokela ho ba joalo.
It's so much fun to watch.	Ho monate haholo ho shebella.
I hope you will be able to read it and love it.	Ke tšepa hore u tla khona ho e bala le ho e rata.
It is not difficult to pass.	Ha ho thata ho feta.
An important legacy, e.	Lefa le bohlokoa, e.
So, it is very important.	Kahoo, e bohlokoa haholo.
This book is hard to read.	Buka ena e thata ho bala.
I don't think you want to be, but it is.	Ha ke nahane hore o batla ho ba jwalo, empa ho jwalo.
I'm not talking to anyone.	Ha ke bue le motho.
For too long.	Ka nako e telele haholo.
Playing together can be difficult.	Ho bapala hammoho ho ka ba thata.
No one knows why.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang lebaka.
They paid with money.	Ba ile ba lefa ka chelete.
Sometimes, learning happens very quickly.	Ka linako tse ling, ho ithuta ho etsahala kapele haholo.
But it was still something.	Empa e ne e ntse e le ntho e itseng.
It must have been caught by something.	E tlameha ebe e ile ea tšoaroa ke ho hong.
We just worked.	Re sa tsoa sebetsa.
Anything can be food.	Ntho efe kapa efe e ka ba lijo.
Except for a few.	Ntle le tse seng kae.
And for this job he needed someone.	Mme bakeng sa mosebetsi ona o ne a hloka motho.
So he thought.	Kahoo a nahana.
But it was a bad car.	Empa e ne e le koloi e mpe.
I did not think so well.	Ke ne ke sa e nahane hantle joalo.
He no longer cared about life.	O ne a se a sa tsotelle bophelo.
You did not belong to me.	Ha u oa ka.
He realizes it because he has to.	O e hlokomela hobane o tlameha.
He just wanted to talk to her.	O ne a batla ho bua le eena feela.
He was the only one who was not in his room.	Ke eena feela ea neng a le sieo ka kamoreng ea hae.
Now.	Hona joale.
Unless he mistreated the teacher.	Ntle le ha a ne a tšoara tichere ka phoso.
Everyone had problems.	E mong le e mong o ne a e-na le mathata.
This is its concept.	Ena ke mohopolo oa eona.
If you can win, you will win.	Ha o ka hlola, o tla hlola.
There are so many things we can talk about.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo re ka buang ka tsona.
They do not have children together.	Ha ba na bana hammoho .
My parents did.	Batsoali ba ka ba etsa joalo.
That is not all.	Ha se lintho tsohle.
The last thing.	Ntho ea ho qetela.
Last time.	Lekhetlo la ho qetela.
Take that woman there.	Nka mosali eo moo.
I don't think they were that close.	Ha ke nahane hore ba ne ba le haufi hakaalo.
However, many others are not so sure.	Leha ho le joalo, ba bang ba bangata ha ba na bonnete hakaalo.
I'm going too.	Le 'na kea tsamaea.
No one will ever know that it exists.	Ha ho motho ea tla tseba hore e teng.
I can't even fix it with a guy.	Ha ke khone le ho e lokisa le mohlankana.
Not her real name.	Ha se lebitso la hae la sebele.
I have never seen that place.	Ha ke eso bone sebaka seo.
He looked behind her.	A sheba ka mora hae.
We all hugged and cried.	Kaofela re ile ra hakana ’me ra lla.
Maybe he didn't have to do anything.	Mohlomong o ne a sa tlameha ho etsa letho.
I can no longer live like that.	Ha ke sa khona ho phela joalo.
Here's how to think about it.	Mona ke mokhoa oa ho nahana ka eona.
He refused to talk to me.	O ile a hana ho bua le 'na.
He just looked at her.	A mo sheba feela.
What you are saying now.	Seo u se buang hona joale.
But do not think that I do not like the food.	Empa u se ke ua nahana hore ha ke rate lijo tseo.
The legal thing, the important thing.	Ntho ea molao, ntho ea bohlokoa.
Sadly he knew his father.	Masoabi o ne a tseba ntate oa hae.
One man.	Monna a le mong .
Or more.	Kapa haholo.
Where were they?	Ba ne ba le hokae?.
I actually planned to do the same thing.	Ha e le hantle ke ne ke rera ho etsa ntho e tšoanang.
Writing is hard work.	Ho ngola ke mosebetsi o boima.
It is powerful.	Ke matla.
I wonder who it sings.	Kea ipotsa hore na e bina mang.
You don't know me either.	Ha o tsebe le nna.
Where they are not, it will stop.	Moo ba leng sieo, e tla ema.
Let's see.	Ha re bone.
It just can't get enough.	Ha e khone ho lekana.
I will understand it.	Ke tla e utloisisa.
Going forward and on.	Ho ea pele le ho ea pele.
One of the longest.	E 'ngoe ea tse telele.
So it worked.	Kahoo ho ile ha sebetsa.
Fun is what was missing.	Monate ke se neng se le sieo.
Most people will want to spend time with you.	Batho ba bangata ba tla batla ho qeta nako le uena.
No matter close.	Ha ho na taba e haufi.
It's too late, it's too late.	E se e le morao haholo, e se e le morao haholo.
This was hard to say.	Sena se ne se le thata ho se bua.
So neither can we.	Kahoo le rona re ke ke ra etsa joalo.
She is obviously happy.	Ho hlakile hore o thabile.
I will never do something like that again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke etsa ntho e kang eo hape.
They would not have to eat or sleep.	Ba ne ba sa tlo lokela ho ja kapa ho robala.
And, finally, it got him.	Mme, qetellong, e ile ya mo fumana.
I can't tell people these things. 	Ha ke khone ho bolella batho lintho tsena. 
But sometimes, you never know.	Empa ka linako tse ling, ha u tsebe.
It means it's not good.	E bolela hore ha e ntle.
He does everything for them.	O ba etsetsa tsohle.
But that is not the case, of course.	Empa ha ho joalo, ehlile.
I got a new one this year.	Ke fumane e ncha selemong sena.
It was new.	E ne e le ncha.
No longer read it all.	Ha e sa le bala kaofela.
He learned to read and write.	O ile a ithuta ho bala le ho ngola.
So we thought we were going to read some things.	Kahoo re ile ra nahana hore re tla bala lintho tse ling.
He always goes there.	O ea moo kamehla.
We can go and watch other people every day.	Re ka ea ho shebella batho ba bang letsatsi le letsatsi.
I do not like these strange things.	Ha ke rate lintho tsena tse makatsang.
It has been happening since the beginning of time.	Haesale ho etsahala ho tloha ha nako e qala.
i don't care	ha ke u tsotelle.
They only have some.	Li na le tse ling feela.
I still have trouble talking to her about anything important.	Ke ntse ke e-na le bothata ba ho bua le eena ka ntho leha e le efe ea bohlokoa.
Sorry to hear about your accident.	Ke masoabi ho utloa ka kotsi ea hau.
You have to play with what you have.	U tlameha ho bapala ka seo u nang le sona.
He is important.	O bohlokoa.
He needed something better.	O ne a hloka ho hong ho betere.
In fact, they do it all the time.	Ha e le hantle, ba etsa joalo ka linako tsohle.
He had a job, you see.	O ne a na le mosebetsi, o a bona.
That would be very helpful.	Seo se ne se tla thusa haholo.
Then hold on to the end.	Ebe u tšoara qetellong.
So they would not have met.	Kahoo ba ka be ba sa kopane.
However, it did not matter.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se taba.
It can take a long time, or not.	E ka nka nako e telele, kapa che.
We wish there were some like you.	Re lakatsa eka ho ka be ho bile le ba tšoanang le uena.
He paid with money.	O ile a lefa ka chelete.
It seemed he never did.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
he asked.	a botsa.
They really wanted to learn it.	Ba ne ba hlile ba batla ho ithuta eona.
We started walking together.	Re ile ra qala ho tsamaea hammoho.
And that can only work.	Mme seo se ka sebetsa feela.
Another not so good.	E 'ngoe e seng ntle.
She was very beautiful and happy.	O ne a le motle haholo a bile a thabile.
From you you know.	Ho tsoa ho uena u tseba.
He went to school every morning and night.	O ne a ya sekolong hoseng ho hong le ho hong le bosiu.
Love your place.	Rata sebaka sa hau.
He was good to me.	O ne a le molemo ho nna.
Just in case.	Feela haeba eng kapa eng.
And they saw a lot of things happening.	'Me ba ile ba bona lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang.
If so, it was even more so.	Haeba ho ne ho le joalo, ho ne ho le joalo le ho feta.
It was actually three years.	E ne e hlile e le lilemo tse tharo.
I never do that kind of thing again.	Ha ke sa etsa lintho tsa mofuta oo hape.
Writing is easier than talking to us sometimes.	Ho ngola ho bonolo ho feta ho bua le rona ka linako tse ling.
He talks a lot.	O bua haholo.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka etsa sena joang.
There is nothing to be afraid of.	Ha ho letho leo o lokelang ho le tšaba.
I do not belong to you.	Ha ke oa hao.
Which is to say it is good.	E leng ho re e ntle.
User friendly.	Ho bonolo ho e sebelisa.
It would have been nice.	E ka be e bile ntle.
What are we eating for dinner today?	Re ja eng bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea kajeno?
I didn’t want to watch.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho shebella.
Maybe someone found it and took it.	E ka ’na eaba e mong o ile a e fumana ’me a e nka.
This is very helpful in learning this group.	Sena se thusa haholo ho ithuta sehlopha sena.
Work is busy here.	Mosebetsi o phathahane mona.
I hope you enjoy it.	Kea tšepa le e thabela.
He saw nothing wrong with it.	O ne a bona ho se letho le phoso.
He has a dog with him.	O na le ntja le eena.
Or nothing else.	Kapa ha ho letho le leng.
She realized that she would never see her mother again.	O ile a hlokomela hore ha a sa tla hlola a bona ’mè oa hae.
And then home,.	Mme ebe hae,.
This is very good.	Sena se setle haholo.
They were so good.	Ba ne ba le molemo hakaalo.
This should tell us something.	Sena se lokela ho re bolella ho hong.
That they go.	Hore ba ya.
That's a very good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle haholo.
You would be a great man.	U ne u tla ba monna oa bohlokoa.
But it's a good place to start.	Empa ke sebaka se setle ho qala.
And my father was one.	Mme Ntate e ne e le e mong.
It's beautiful.	E ntle.
Bad thing.	Ntho e mpe.
Still, if you want to know.	Ho ntse ho le joalo, haeba u batla ho tseba.
We found out he was going to be a boy.	Re ile ra fumana hore e tla ba moshanyana.
I'm not sure what this means.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na sena se bolela eng.
I wanted to come with my own.	Ke ne ke batla ho tla le ea ka.
We talk, but nothing happens.	Re bua, empa ha ho letho le etsahalang.
The important thing is that you have it.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore u na le eona.
I refused to tell him yes.	Ke ile ka hana ho mo bolella e.
This has its drawbacks.	Sena se na le mathata a sona.
I will give him so much.	Ke tla mo fa hakaalo.
The man spoke to the man.	Monna eo o ile a bua le monna eo.
I, like you, have felt the same way.	Le 'na, joalo ka uena, ke bile le maikutlo a tšoanang.
However, we will have to do this again.	Leha ho le joalo, re tla tlameha ho etsa sena hape.
He doesn't believe it.	Ha a e lumele.
I do that often.	Ke etsa joalo hangata.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Lintho tsohle li ne li bonahala li tsamaea hantle.
It may be true.	E ka 'na eaba ke 'nete.
Everyone knows about you.	Bohle ba tseba ka wena.
This was an idea.	Ena e ne e le maikutlo.
That should not happen.	Seo ha sea lokela ho etsahala.
He could not speak.	O ne a sitoa ho bua.
Yes, it still is.	E, ho ntse ho le joalo.
He was in pain there.	O ne a utloa bohloko moo.
I think it could be both.	Ke nahana hore e ka ba bobeli.
But this is not the case here.	Empa sena ha se taba mona.
They did not believe him.	Ha baa ka ba mo lumela.
It means a lot.	E bolela haholo.
That comes with being human.	Seo se tla le ho ba motho.
That was the case before this happened.	Eo e ne e le taba pele sena se etsahala.
Opinions are very important to us.	Maikutlo a bohlokoa haholo ho rona.
It would not have worked for my child or me.	E ka be e sa sebetsa bakeng sa ngoana oa ka kapa 'na.
They do.	Ba etsa joalo.
He was with them.	O ne a ena le bona.
I have seen it and it still looks good to me.	Ke e bone mme e ntse e shebahala e le ntle ho nna.
This was fun.	Sena se ne se le monate.
The toy seemed to be new.	Ntho ea ho bapala e ne e bonahala e le ncha.
She is much better.	O betere haholo.
Find a job.	Batla mosebetsi.
We just did it to make it.	Re e entse feela ho e etsa.
They had your name, he says.	Ba ne ba na le lebitso la hao, o re.
Do not say or do anything.	O se ke wa bua kapa wa etsa letho.
If someone helps, he helps.	Haeba motho a thusa, oa thusa.
I want to make that money.	Ke batla ho etsa chelete eo.
It is very difficult.	Ho thata haholo.
I will never return.	Ha ke sa tla khutla.
I had no idea you could do this.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore o ka etsa sena.
It was a car accident.	E bile kotsi ea koloi.
Of course they go looking for it.	Ehlile ba ea e batla.
It's just that you like to have a lot of money.	Ke feela hore o rata ho ba le chelete e ngata.
Then they return home.	Ebe ba khutlela hae.
I got your letter.	Ke fumane lengolo la hao.
It could not be that person.	E ne e ka se be motho eo.
I know what you meant.	Ke tseba seo o neng o se bolela.
Things were not going well.	Lintho li ne li sa tsamaee hantle.
This is a nice restaurant.	Ena ke ntlo ea lijo e ntle.
But that is not the way it should be.	Empa ha se kamoo e lokelang ho ba kateng.
Meet with a group.	Kopana le le sehlopha.
I think about his questions.	Ke nahana ka lipotso tsa hae.
I seem to do this all the time.	Ke bonahala ke etsa sena kamehla.
My family knows that.	Lelapa la ka le tseba seo.
He was just there doing his thing.	O ne a le teng feela a etsa ntho ya hae.
He was here last year.	O ne a le mona selemong se fetileng.
For the same reason.	Ka lebaka le le leng.
Our lives are what we do to them.	Bophelo ba rona ke seo re se etsang ho bona.
And that was the last one.	Mme eo e ne e le ya ho qetela.
He used another one for this type.	O ile a sebelisa e 'ngoe bakeng sa mofuta ona.
Would he be able to.	Na o ne a tla khona.
Go ahead, and eat as much as you like.	Tsoela pele, 'me u je haholo kamoo u ratang.
I am very happy too.	Ke thabile haholo le nna.
He will expect you to be present.	O tla lebella hore o be teng feela.
I am a young man.	Ke mohlankana.
Still enjoy it.	Leha ho le joalo thabela eona.
We have to get out.	Re tlameha ho tsoa.
She cried.	O ile a lla.
Where should we stay?	Re lokela ho lula hokae?
Every morning.	Hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
It means something.	E bolela ho hong.
He never used them.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a li sebelisa.
I will only say this.	Ke tla bolela sena feela.
I have books to write.	Ke na le libuka tseo ke lokelang ho li ngola.
We are very sorry.	Re masoabi haholo.
I still looked like a child.	Ke ne ke ntse ke shebahala joaloka ngoana.
It is clear to me that you have strong feelings for him.	Ho hlakile ho 'na hore u na le maikutlo a matla ho eena.
We are just like that.	Le rona re joalo feela.
And she is strong.	Mme o thata.
He did not understand why he did not eat.	O ne a sa utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha e sa je.
But he knew that there was no point in doing so.	Empa o ne a tseba hore ha ho na thuso ho tsoela pele ka taba eo.
There is no reason to doubt any of that.	Ha ho lebaka la ho belaela leha e le efe ea seo.
Do any outside.	Na leha e le efe ka ntle.
I had said to him.	Ke ne ke itse ho eena.
Now, get in here.	Jwale, kena ka mona.
I watched him go there every day.	Ke ile ka mo shebella ha a ea moo letsatsi le leng le le leng.
He told me he could really help.	O ile a mpolella hore ka sebele a ka thusa.
He wants them to find out what will happen to them.	O batla hore ba fumane se tlang ho bona.
It worked well.	E ile ea sebetsa hantle.
It was just fun.	E ne e le monate feela.
It's beautiful.	E ntle.
You learn it by doing.	U ithuta eona ka ho etsa.
One person is healthy, the other is not.	Motho a le mong o phela hantle, e mong ha a eo.
They say what we are saying now.	Ba bua seo re se buang hona joale.
No it is not.	Che ha ho joalo.
He knew that well and was able to continue it for years.	O ile a tseba seo hantle 'me a khona ho tsoela pele ho sona ka lilemo.
Stand down, man.	Ema fatše, monna.
The reason for this is simple.	Lebaka la sena le bonolo.
Sometimes it makes him breakfast.	Ka nako e 'ngoe e mo etsetsa lijo tsa hoseng.
My human hands.	Matsoho a ka a motho.
Clearly, he had done this before.	Ho hlakile hore o kile a etsa sena pele.
We worked together.	Re ile ra sebetsa hammoho.
You can even go out.	U ka ba ua tsoa.
Stop doing that.	Tlohela ho etsa seo.
I understood what she was saying to me before she spoke.	Ke ile ka utloisisa seo a neng a mpolella sona le pele a se bua.
I don't know if you know.	Ha ke tsebe hore na oa tseba.
Thank you for that.	Kea leboha ka seo.
Then you go back in the room and plan our day.	Ebe u khutlela ka kamoreng 'me u rera letsatsi la rona.
We know this is our home, because it feels like ours.	Rea tseba hore ena ke ntlo ea rona, hobane e ikutloa e le ea rona.
I thought he could play.	Ke ne ke nahana hore a ka bapala.
He says that this is not the case here.	O bolela hore mona ha ho joalo.
It is empty now.	Hona joale ha e na letho.
Of how to keep home.	Ea mokhoa oa ho boloka hae.
That's where he was at.	Ke eo moo a neng a le teng.
He had one room.	O ne a e-na le kamore e le 'ngoe.
I can get there easily enough.	Nka fihla moo ha bonolo ho lekana.
She could not even cry.	O ne a sitoa le ho lla.
We need to do this often.	Re lokela ho etsa sena hangata.
We probably will not do that.	Mohlomong re ke ke ra etsa joalo.
They only work with people who come a second time.	Ba sebetsa feela le batho ba tlang ka lekhetlo la bobeli.
I went looking for it.	Ke ile ho e batla.
They can just stand there.	Ba ka ema jwalo feela moo.
Try harder.	Leka ka matla haholo.
Something made me do it.	Ho na le ntho e entseng hore ke etse joalo.
And it doesn't matter what you do.	Mme ha ho na taba hore na o etsang.
I need hours, so he stays with me.	Ke hloka lihora, kahoo o lula le nna.
But you should learn from it.	Empa u lokela ho ithuta ho eona.
You feel tired.	U ikutloa u khathetse.
What he was trying to do.	Seo a neng a leka ho se etsa.
It really does.	E hlile e etsa joalo.
I know that day was very important for both of us.	Kea tseba hore letsatsi leo le ne le le bohlokoa haholo ho rona ka bobeli.
Is something going on?	Ho na le ntho e etsahalang?
Moreover, he is always a superior person.	Ho feta moo, o lula e le motho ea phahameng.
I knew he was talking about me.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o ne a bua ka nna.
He wept, because he had no one.	A lla, hobane o ne a se na motho.
No comments.	Ha ho na maikutlo.
You often think that the worst thing ever happened.	Hangata o nahana hore ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa e etsahala.
Yes, this is not the case today.	E, sena ke se teng kajeno.
Imagine that the man is speaking to the boy.	Nka hore monna eo o bua le moshanyana eo.
He also loved his name.	O ne a rata le lebitso la hae.
What he knows, he knows.	Seo a se tsebang, oa tseba.
Life takes time.	Ho phela ho nka nako.
And his alone.	Le ea hae a le mong.
They really work.	Ba hlile ba sebetsa.
He always did not know he was there.	O ne a lula a sa tsebe hore o teng.
This is what fatherhood is all about.	Sena ke seo ho ba ntate ho leng sona.
Maybe we are wrong.	Mohlomong re etsa phoso.
The young man was gone.	Mohlankana o ne a ile.
Some people were walking.	Batho ba bang ba ne ba tsamaea.
Or what it was supposed to do for you.	Kapa seo e neng e lokela ho o etsetsa sona.
What time is it now?	Ke nako mang jwale?
It was a strange thing for me.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang ho nna.
I wouldn’t have done it any other way though.	Ke ne nke ke ka e etsa ka tsela e 'ngoe leha ho le joalo.
I will go on.	Ke se ke tla tsoela pele.
I can't speak for long.	Ha ke khone ho bua nako e telele.
She is very happy.	O thabile haholo.
True, it was almost wet.	Ke 'nete hore e ne e batla e le metsi.
You will find that we can get another one.	U tla fumana hore re ka fumana e 'ngoe.
Anyone can see others.	Motho e mong le e mong a ka bona ba bang.
No, we can't help you.	Che, re ke ke ra u thusa.
I only have to spend a week.	Ke tlameha ho qeta beke feela.
But some think that he is innocent.	Empa ba bang ba nahana hore monna eo ha a na molato.
You will also notice that some things are not there.	Hape u tla hlokomela hore lintho tse ling ha li eo.
I know such a man.	Ke tseba monna ea joalo.
You know.	Ua tseba.
Playing with him.	Ho bapala le eena.
I had never done anything like this before.	Ke ne ke qala ho etsa ntho e kang ena.
He spoke to them.	A bua le bona.
However, we did not care.	Leha ho le joalo, re ne re sa tsotelle.
I have a problem.	Ke na le bothata.
He will think of something else.	O tla nahana ka se seng.
In this way.	Ka tsela ena .
I did that.	Ke entse joalo.
It does not matter.	Ha ho na taba.
I will never need your book again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke hloka buka ea hau.
Thank you for your request.	Kea leboha ka kopo ea hau.
He could talk his way in or out of anything.	O ne a khona ho bua ka tsela ea hae ho kena kapa ho tsoa ho eng kapa eng.
I just got them, you know.	Ke sa tsoa li fumana, ua tseba.
But we will understand it.	Empa re tla e utloisisa.
She could not understand why she felt that way.	O ne a sa utloisise hore na ke hobane’ng ha a ikutloa joalo.
There is no money there.	Haho chelete moo.
I do not want.	ha ke batle.
We had no food or water at all.	Ho hang re ne re se na lijo kapa metsi.
Everything they do is for people to see.	Ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe eo ba e etsang ke hore batho ba e bone.
She wants him to see her as no one has ever seen her.	O batla hore a mo bone joalo ka ha ho se motho ea kileng a mo bona.
It is more than just a car.	E feta koloi feela.
He made them all.	O ba entse kaofela.
And we are still here.	Mme re ntse re le teng.
Be better than this.	Eba betere ho feta sena.
We can drink.	Re ka noa.
And why you should !.	Mme hobaneng o lokela!.
We are very happy to be with you.	Re thabile haholo ho ba le uena.
There is nothing you can do.	Ha ho letho leo o ka le etsang.
And he knows it somehow.	Mme o tseba ka tsela e itseng.
Find out what's happening to her.	Fumana hore na ho etsahala'ng ka eena.
It was still hard to believe he was gone.	Ho ne ho ntse ho le thata ho lumela hore o ile.
They all passed.	Bohle ba ile ba feta.
It is not difficult to see.	Ha se ntho e thata ho e bona.
It can't be just me.	Ha se ka nna feela.
I want to be that kind.	Ke batla ho ba mofuta oo.
That was a bad time.	Eo e ne e le nako e mpe.
You are clear.	U hlakile.
Do fun things.	Etsa lintho tse monate.
I don't want to be anywhere.	Ha ke batle ho ba kae kapa kae.
I never believe them.	Le ka mohla ha ke ba lumele.
I think he is saying it as it is.	Ke nahana hore o bua joalo ka ha ho le joalo.
Things were going on.	Lintho li ne li ntse li tsoela pele.
His power is real.	Matla a hae ke a sebele.
We didn't want to talk about it.	Ha rea ​​ka ra batla ho bua ka taba eo.
The people are very friendly here and enjoy life.	Batho ba bonolo haholo mona 'me ba thabela bophelo.
I, too, do not believe this!	Le 'na, ha ke lumele sena!
This girl.	Le ngoanana.
We can find some similar ones.	Re ka fumana tse ling tse tšoanang le tsona.
You get the idea.	O fumana mohopolo.
To this day he has said nothing about it.	Ho fihlela kajeno ha a so ka a bua letho ka hona.
I was thinking of you this morning.	Ke ne ke ntse ke nahana ka wena hoseng hona.
Food could stand.	Lijo li ne li ka ema.
Nothing like that has ever happened.	Ha hoa etsahala ntho e joalo.
I do that sometimes, I talk too much.	Ke etsa joalo ka linako tse ling, ke bua haholo.
This was going to happen.	Sena se ne se tla etsahala.
Try another location.	Leka sebaka se seng mohlomong.
Or write down the place you want to know.	Kapa ngola sebaka seo u batlang ho se tseba.
We understand that you need help with your problem right now.	Re utloisisa hore u hloka thuso ka bothata ba hau hona joale.
That happened often.	Seo se ne se etsahala hangata.
Just watching this happen.	Ho sheba feela sena se etsahala.
They overcome problems.	Ba hlola mathata.
I really don't know what's going on with me.	Ruri ha ke tsebe hore na ho etsahalang ka nna.
It can still be.	E ntse e ka ba joalo.
I have not started working with you for money.	Ha kea qala ho sebetsa le uena bakeng sa chelete.
And so he took a chance.	Mme kahoo a nka monyetla.
He could not stay here long.	O ne a sa khone ho lula mona nako e telele.
Some of them may be present.	Ba bang ba bona e ka ’na eaba ba teng hona joale.
It's really easy instead.	E hlile e bonolo ho e-na le hoo.
We did not know.	Re ne re sa tsebe.
But it really is.	Empa ehlile ho joalo.
That probably will not happen.	Mohlomong seo se ke ke sa etsahala.
We got it right.	Re e fumane hantle.
When they arrived.	Ha ba fihla.
The phone did not ring.	Mohala ha oa ka oa lla.
I can feel it here too.	Ke khona ho e utloa le mona.
It is not a matter of money.	Ha se taba ea chelete.
Or, more often, both.	Kapa, ​​hangata, ka bobeli.
People come every day.	Batho ba tla letsatsi le leng le le leng.
That is to do it.	Ke hore o e etse.
I sleep.	Ke robala.
The easy way you have with each other.	Tsela e bonolo eo le nang le eona le e mong.
They can win this team.	Ba ka hlola sehlopha sena.
It would have gone to me.	E ka be e ile ho nna.
He won first.	O ile a hlola pele.
He was there.	O ne a le teng.
Anyone who had anything to do with this must go.	E mong le e mong ea neng a e-na le letho ka sena o tlameha ho tsamaea.
It is not enough to just open it.	Ha e a lekana ho bula feela.
They work without regard for the law.	Ba sebetsa ba sa tsotelle molao.
They live in denial.	Ba phela ka ho hana.
Man, to be very nice.	Monna, ho ba motle haholo.
But wait a minute.	Empa ema hanyane.
You look beautiful.	O shebahala o le motle.
But there is nothing wrong with that.	Empa ha ho letho le phoso.
But you can't go back.	Empa u ke ke ua khutlela morao.
Now let's go to bed.	Jwale ha re ilo robala.
To each one of you, I'm one of them.	Ho e mong le e mong wa lona, ​​ke e mong wa bona.
But, did he do that? '	Empa, o entse joalo?'
To see what we do.	Ho bona seo re se etsang.
However, he is always working.	Leha ho le joalo, o lula a sebetsa.
I saw my parents in a new way.	Ke ile ka bona batsoali ba ka ka tsela e ncha.
He was not sure it would help anything.	O ne a sena bonnete ba hore e tla thusa letho.
Yet he was not.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a se joalo.
How to realize that it was beyond him.	Mokhoa oa ho hlokomela hore e ne e mo feta.
I used to do things with my hands.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ho etsa lintho ka matsoho a ka.
You will be able to sleep well from now on.	U tla khona ho robala hantle ho tloha joale ho ea pele.
They all had to be arrested.	Kaofela ba ne ba lokela ho tšoaroa.
That would mean that he wanted to stay.	Seo se ne se tla bolela hore o ne a batla ho lula.
We were fast ahead and alone.	Re ne re le kapele ka pele re le bang.
I still eat sweets.	Ke ntse ke ja lintho tse monate.
And it was not my decision.	Mme e ne e se qeto ya ka.
Let's see what happens.	A re bone se etsahalang.
Of course, it does not make me do anything.	Ha e le hantle, ha e etse hore ke etse letho.
As long as we can stay in the present.	Ha feela re ka dula nakong ya jwale.
So, my method works better.	Kahoo, mokhoa oa ka o sebetsa haholoanyane.
He plays well and plays hard.	O bapala hantle mme o bapala ka thata.
So it is not there for me.	Kahoo ha e eo bakeng sa ka.
But you have to understand.	Empa u tlameha ho utloisisa.
No, yes, but it is true.	Che, ee, empa ke 'nete.
I will always thank you.	Ke tla dula ke le leboha kamehla.
It was a wonderful day.	E bile letsatsi le makatsang.
It is what it is.	Ke seo e leng sona.
He had never thought of that opportunity until now.	O ne a e-s'o nahane ka monyetla oo ho fihlela joale.
He had done something he knew he would never do.	O ne a entse ntho eo a neng a tseba hore a ke ke a e etsa.
I mean, can you do that?	Ke bolela, na u ka etsa joalo?
You just don't get it.	Ha o e fumane feela.
No work, no money.	Ha ho mosebetsi, ha ho chelete.
This is the real thing.	Ena ke eona ntho ea sebele.
You will get a chance to do a good job.	O tla fumana monyetla oa ho etsa mosebetsi o motle.
I was very happy for him.	Ke ne ke mo thabetse haholo.
But it was still very fun.	Empa ho ne ho ntse ho le monate haholo.
He stood up, waiting.	A ema, a lebella.
He says he thinks they can take one car.	O re o bona eka ba ka nka koloi e le 'ngoe.
He does not have much money.	Ha a na chelete e ngata.
But something unusual happened next.	Empa ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
I make the same suggestion.	Ke etsa tlhahiso e tšoanang.
He didn't have to say it, he knew.	O ne a sa lokela ho e bua, o ne a tseba.
He drank his coffee.	O ile a noa kofi ea hae.
I really liked the place.	Ke ne ke rata sebaka seo haholo.
I was soft enough before.	Ke ne ke e-na le bonolo ka ho lekaneng pele.
The question is.	Potso ke hore na.
If they do not, this could be a dangerous group.	Haeba ba sa etse joalo, sena e ka ba sehlopha se kotsi.
He was not sure he could.	O ne a se na bonnete ba hore a ka khona.
I'm glad we didn't.	Ke thabela hore ebe ha re etse joalo.
It was still working.	E ne e ntse e sebetsa.
I know it is.	Kea tseba hore ho joalo.
So, you have.	Kahoo, u na le.
I know how you feel.	Kea tseba hore na u ikutloa joang.
Stopping while driving.	Ho ema ha o khanna.
Bad things were about to happen.	Lintho tse mpe li ne li le haufi le ho etsahala.
Yet he does not like it.	Leha ho le joalo ha a e rate.
Many people here have done that.	Batho ba bangata mona ba ne ba entse joalo.
He did not yet know what would happen.	O ne a e-s'o tsebe hore na ho ka etsahala'ng.
If it is true they must ask for help.	Haeba ke 'nete ba tlameha ho kopa thuso.
He felt he knew more.	O ne a ikutloa a tseba lintho haholoanyane.
I really like this book.	Ke rata buka ena haholo.
It's a matter of what.	Ke taba ya eng.
But first, let me tell you why we are here.	Empa pele, e re ke u bolelle hore na ke hobane’ng ha re le teng.
We have to go through it now.	Re tlameha ho feta le eona hona joale.
But he never asked for it.	Empa ha ho mohla a kileng a e botsa.
This is very good news.	Tsena ke litaba tse monate haholo.
I know you are doing what you can.	Kea tseba hore u etsa seo u ka se khonang.
It had my name on it.	E ne e na le lebitso la ka ho eona.
This question should be simple and quick.	Potso ena e lokela ho ba bonolo le kapele.
It is useless to hope that they will leave.	Ha ho na thuso ho tšepa hore ba tla tsamaea.
He seemed to love the house very much.	O ne a bonahala a rata ntlo haholo.
I understand very well.	Ke utloisisa hantle.
It would be best for us to make it down here.	Ho ka ba molemo hore re e etse fatše fatše mona.
At the same time he felt compelled to continue.	Ka nako e tšoanang o ile a ikutloa a tlameha ho tsoela pele.
I love his work.	Ke rata mosebetsi oa hae.
I'm sure that's what you think.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ke seo u se nahanang.
I will let it go.	Ke tla e tlohela.
His problem is with me.	Bothata ba hae bo ho nna.
It was easy this way.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ka tsela ena.
I hope you feel better.	Ke tšepa hore u ikutloa u le betere.
Now, think a little.	Jwale, nahana hanyane.
We have a duty to care.	Re na le mosebetsi oa ho hlokomela.
I had never found anyone like me.	Ke ne ke e-s'o fumane e mong ea tšoanang le 'na.
It is incredibly powerful.	E matla ka tsela e makatsang.
It did not take long to get started.	Ha hoa ka ha nka nako e telele ho qala.
He corrected the mistake.	O ile a lokisa phoso eo.
Not too many.	Ha li ngata haholo.
I've never seen it.	Ha ke so e bone.
Looking for another.	Ho batla e 'ngoe.
If they can't, they can't.	Haeba ba sa khone, ba ke ke ba khona.
You have to be tough.	O tlameha ho ba thata.
He had no money.	O ne a se na chelete.
It's so nice to see you again.	Ho monate haholo ho o bona hape.
You would not do that, would you?	U ne u ke ke ua etsa joalo, na ha ho joalo?
Now he will give you a bad time with you.	Hona joale o tla u fa nako e mpe le uena.
He was thinking wrong.	O ne a nahana phoso.
There was something wrong, and he needed to know what it was.	Ho ne ho e-na le phoso, 'me o ne a hloka ho tseba hore na ke eng.
It was very difficult for me.	Ho ne ho le boima haholo ho nna.
You really need to stop this.	O hlile o hloka ho tlohela sena.
But there are a few questions.	Empa ho na le lipotso tse seng kae.
I need to see how this happens !!.	Ke hloka ho bona hore na ho etsahala joang ho sena !!.
This should not take long.	Sena ha sea lokela ho nka nako e ngata.
Never do good to your friends.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua etsetsa metsoalle molemo.
It started.	E ile ea qala.
No one would feel it.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tla ikutloa.
People think we have a chance to be very good.	Batho ba nahana hore re na le monyetla oa ho ba hantle haholo.
That would have been an easy way out.	Eo e ka be e bile tsela e bonolo ea ho tsoa ho eona.
There is not much news otherwise.	Ha ho na litaba tse ngata ho seng joalo.
I have one too.	Le 'na ke na le e 'ngoe.
No more '.	Ha e sa le eo '.
You can never be as powerful as we are.	Le ka mohla u ke ke ua ba le matla joaloka rōna.
Please, do not do that!	Ke kopa o seke oa etsa joalo!
We were already wearing our wet clothes.	Re ne re se re apere liaparo tsa rona tsa metsi.
It's nothing.	Ha se letho.
Somehow, sometimes it just hurts.	Ka tsela e itseng, ka linako tse ling ke bohloko feela.
And then it would have been so.	'Me joale ho ka be ho bile joalo.
He read.	O ne a bala.
I'm not sure how to get started.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka qala joang.
Read carefully.	Bala hantle.
I wish it could be me.	Ke lakatsa eka e ka ba nna.
He stood and waited for them.	A ema a ba emetse.
I had no chance to say that.	Ke ne ke se na monyetla oa ho bua joalo.
He did not know his name, his age, or his whereabouts.	O ne a sa tsebe lebitso la hae, lilemo kapa moo a leng teng.
You have to give it your all.	O tlameha ho fana ka tsohle.
Think of both.	Nahana ka bobeli.
You can save money.	U ka boloka chelete.
Both seemed to be busy.	Ho bonahala eka bobeli le ne le phathahane.
I consider it strange.	Ke u nka e le ntho e makatsang.
They pay them, but not anymore.	Ba a ba lefa, empa ha ho sa le jwalo.
I'm starting to see it.	Ke qala ho bona.
He will come to you.	O tla tla ho wena.
For some it was a last resort.	Ho ba bang e ne e le sebaka sa ho qetela.
Of course, not everyone is in a position to make such a drastic adjustment.	Ke ’nete hore hase bohle kajeno ba etsang mosebetsi oa mofuta ona.
That may sound bad to me.	Seo se ka bonahala se le mpe ho 'na .
He opened the door and went inside.	A bula lemati a kena.
He was always alive at that time.	O ne a lula a phela nakong eo.
Home as soon as he finished.	Hae hang ha a qeta.
When he talked to the group about it, everyone agreed.	Ha a bua le sehlopha ka eona, bohle ba ile ba lumela.
You love it, you use it.	Ua e rata, ua e sebelisa.
The children are at home today.	Bana ba teng hae kajeno.
He thought it was possible.	O ne a nahana hore ho ka etsahala.
I know now that you have no style.	Kea tseba hona joale hore ha u na mokhoa.
And you have to pay for it in advance.	'Me u tlameha ho li lefa esale pele.
My father comes home from work.	Ntate o fihla hae morao mosebetsing.
He will never forget you.	A ke ke a o lebala.
No, that is true.	Che, hoo ke ’nete.
As it is.	Joalo ka ha ho le joalo.
He did not come.	Ha a ka a tla.
Sometimes, they can try something else.	Ka linako tse ling, ba ka leka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I like to take things in stride and try not focus too much on the problem.	Ke rata ho nka lintho le ho li etsa tsa sebele.
I will not be there for dinner at that time.	Ha ke na ho ba teng bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea ka nako eo.
Now do it again.	Jwale e etse hape.
It would be easy for me, too.	Ho ka ba bonolo ho 'na, hape.
It is not just money.	Ha se chelete feela.
Nothing seemed to fit perfectly.	Ho ne ho se letho le neng le bonahala le lekana hantle.
Look at the strange thing.	Sheba ntho e makatsang.
She was playing when she was a girl.	O ne a bapala ha e sa le ngoanana.
It is a very simple question.	Ke potso e bonolo haholo.
But that doesn't matter.	Empa hoo ha ho na taba.
How many years have you worked there?	U na le lilemo tse kae u sebetsa moo?
They do nothing.	Ha ba etse letho.
I never thought about it before.	Ke ne ke sa nahana ka eona pele.
He did not come.	Ha a ka a tla.
Yes or no.	Ke ee kapa che.
It could not have passed.	E ka be e sa ka ya feta.
I have had one very serious accident.	Ke bile le kotsi e le 'ngoe haholo.
It seemed we didn’t know it existed.	Ho ne ho bonahala re sa tsebe hore e teng.
No letter or anything.	Ha ho lengolo kapa eng kapa eng.
No one knows for sure.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle.
Your life is yours.	Bophelo ba hao ke ba hao.
I a.	Ke a.
But he was not yet close.	Empa o ne a e-s’o be haufi.
He had never spoken.	O ne a eso ho bue.
Also, you never know who you will meet.	Hape, ha u tsebe hore na u tla kopana le mang.
I started writing.	Ke ile ka qala ho ngola.
We just love being able to talk to you.	Re thabela feela ho khona ho bua le uena.
I have nothing.	Ha ke na letho.
It didn’t take long for that, either.	Ha a ka a nka nako e telele ho seo, le hona.
And that is not good.	Mme seo ha se setle.
And we will work until you are stronger.	Mme re tla sebetsa ho fihlela o le matla le ho feta.
We are not close.	Ha re haufi.
We can use them over time.	Re ka li sebelisa ha nako e ntse e ea.
It is also very important but can be very useful.	Hape ke ntho ea bohlokoa haholo empa e ka ba molemo haholo.
I had to go outside.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tsoela ka ntle.
I would be able to.	Ke ne ke tla khona.
They played like us.	Ba ne ba bapala joalo ka rona.
Maybe everything will go well this time.	Mohlomong tsohle li tla tsamaea hantle nakong ena.
I wish he could just come.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka tla feela.
Either way you look at it.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe o e sheba.
Though he knows he can never.	Leha a tseba hore ha ho mohla a ka khonang.
I told you next week.	Ke le boleletse bekeng e tlang.
Which is to say that this was really the case.	E leng hore sena se ne se hlile se le joalo.
He will say yes.	O tla re ho joalo.
One might wonder if anything is happening at all.	Motho a ka ’na a ipotsa hore na ho na le ntho e etsahalang ho hang.
I can sleep once again.	Nka robala hang hape.
His name is still alive.	Lebitso la hae le ntse le phela.
Something hard.	Ntho e thata.
That's the only way.	Ke eona feela tsela.
Maybe he wanted her to know.	Mohlomong o ne a batla hore a tsebe.
He could do this.	O ne a ka etsa sena.
As it was his, he thought.	Joalo ka ha e ne e le ea hae, o ne a nahana.
It didn't matter now.	Ho ne ho se na taba jwale.
I enjoy doing it.	Ke thabela ho e etsa.
Just do your job.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau feela.
Others feel the same way.	Ba bang ba ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
Very old.	Ea khale haholo.
This was a mistake.	Ena e ne e le phoso.
He looked, and looked back.	O ile a sheba, mme a sheba morao.
But being here is not a matter of my drinking.	Empa ho ba ha ka mona ha se taba ea ho noa ha ka.
Someone has it.	Ho na le motho ea nang le eona.
We got into it.	Re ile ra kena ho eona.
But that is not one of them.	Empa ha se e mong oa seo.
I was hurt.	Ke ne ke utloile bohloko.
I could not let him go.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho mo lumella hore a tsamaee.
They did not ask for it.	Ha ba ka ba e kopa.
One family had none of that.	Lelapa le leng le ne le se na letho la seo.
I did just that.	Ke ile ka etsa joalo.
I know you can just have your friends.	Kea tseba u ka mpa ua ba le metsoalle ea hau.
That was the other way around.	Eo e ne e le mokhoa o mong.
I still do not understand.	Ke ntse ke sa utloisise.
However, I can't understand it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke khone ho e utloisisa.
In the end it would not be enough.	Qetellong ho ne ho ke ke ha lekana.
Everything you would like to know about this topic.	Tsohle tseo o ka ratang ho li tseba ka taba ena.
It looked like before.	E ne e shebahala joaloka pele.
Some people get it.	Batho ba bang ba e fumana.
Giving money is an individual decision.	Chelete ea ho fana ka chelete ke qeto ea motho ka mong.
He tried to decide if that was good news or bad news.	O ile a leka ho etsa qeto ea hore na tseo ke litaba tse monate kapa tse mpe haholo.
Of course, he looks good.	Ehlile, o shebahala hantle.
One.	Ea mong.
I think they are good.	Ke nahana hore li ntle.
If you have to walk, just walk.	Haeba u tlameha ho tsamaea, tsamaea feela.
They love children.	Ba rata bana.
Stop that, too.	Tlohela seo, hape.
They did the same with many others.	Ba entse joalo le tse ling tse ngata.
He leaves them.	O a ba tlohela.
You have never been.	Ha o eso be teng.
che.	che.
He has a strong opinion on this issue.	O na le maikutlo a matla ka taba ena.
However, last year it did not work.	Leha ho le joalo, selemong se fetileng ha ea ka ea sebetsa.
But at the end of the day, people stay here.	Empa qetellong ea letsatsi, batho ba lula mona.
I hope you know what this equals.	Ke tšepa u tseba hore na sena se lekana le eng.
I don't want to be there again.	Ha ke batle ho ba teng hape.
It must.	E tlameha.
They talk about their day.	Ba bua ka letsatsi la bona.
This they are trying to do.	Sena ba leka ho se etsa.
Emotional issue.	Taba ea maikutlo.
That is if you are reading.	Ke hore haeba u ntse u bala.
We were going to tell him what we wanted him to do.	Re ne re tl’o mo bolella seo re batlang hore a se etse.
You too will have to take care of him.	Le uena u tla lokela ho mo hlokomela.
If you can.	Haeba u ka khona.
There was a problem.	Ho bile le bothata.
I will fix it in the morning.	Ke tla e lokisa hoseng.
They are all human beings.	Ke batho bohle.
He had his problems, you know.	O ne a ena le mathata a hae, le a tseba.
Some for one reason, some for others.	Ba bang ka lebaka le le leng, ba bang bakeng sa ba bang.
What I tell you.	Ke u bolella eng.
There is nothing.	Ha ho letho.
He was too strong for her.	O ne a le matla haholo bakeng sa hae.
She looks at him, empty-handed.	O mo sheba, a se na letho.
I told her not to think about doing that.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore a se ke a nahana ka ho etsa joalo.
Do everything in his name.	Etsa tsohle ka lebitso la hae.
I don't see what he should enjoy.	Ha ke bone seo a lokelang ho se thabela.
You are writing things down.	U ntse u ngola lintho.
He loves all.	O rata bohle.
All you have to do is stand up.	Seo u lokelang ho se etsa ke ho ema.
They were coming, of course. 	Ba ne ba e tla, ehlile. 
Some are not helpful at all.	Tse ling ha li na thuso ho hang.
This was a wonderful morning.	Hona e ne e le hoseng ho makatsang.
It makes everyone better.	E etsa hore bohle ba be betere.
She never knew him.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a mo tseba.
But he does not see.	Empa ha a bone.
Others will give a little.	Ba bang ba tla fana ka hanyane.
When are we leaving?	Re tla tsamaea neng?
I didn’t expect him to start with it so soon.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore o tla qala ka eona haufinyane hakana.
After a while, he spoke.	Ka mor’a nako, o ile a bua.
But to fix the problem properly, you have to understand the problem.	Empa ho lokisa bothata hantle, o tlameha ho utloisisa bothata.
There are no people.	Ha ho na batho.
It is not a mental force.	Ha se matla a kelello.
And we can.	'Me re ka khona.
Then move on.	Ebe u tsoela pele.
And it almost did.	Mme e batla e entse jwalo.
Of course.	Ke 'nete hore.
I still enjoy everything.	Ke ntse ke thabela ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
I had nothing wrong with it.	Ke ne ke se na letho le phoso ka eona.
He asked why you were not with him.	O ile a botsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha u se na eena.
Maybe it's a mistake they made.	Mohlomong ke phoso eo ba e entseng.
He is strong.	O matla.
No news not news.	Ha ho litaba ha se litaba.
It did not matter at all.	Ho ne ho se na taba le 'nete ho hang.
Thank you for being with him.	Kea leboha hore ebe u ntse u e-na le eena.
This is a great opportunity.	Ona ke monyetla o moholo.
Maybe you are one of them.	Mohlomong u e mong oa bona.
I'll be back.	Ke tla khutla.
But we have a certain idea.	Empa re na le mohopolo o itseng.
Food would take time.	Lijo li ne li tla nka nako.
But my son is in danger.	Empa mora oa ka o kotsing.
I knew that.	Ke ne ke tseba seo.
I can only ask it.	Nka e botsa feela.
They were in the same group.	Ba ne ba bile sehlopheng se le seng.
I just want to try to see if anything will come out of it.	Ke batla feela ho leka hore na ho na le ho hong ho tla tsoa ho eona.
He would have to go to vocational school.	O ne a tla tlameha ho ea sekolong sa mosebetsi oa matsoho.
It starts well.	E qala hantle.
Probably, he thought.	Mohlomong, o ile a nahana.
He was trying to understand it.	O ne a leka ho e utloisisa.
There was not enough homework to keep me busy.	Ho ne ho se na mosebetsi oa sekolo o lekaneng hore ke lule ke phathahane.
Power, and others.	Matla, le ba bang.
I was only there for three days.	Ke bile moo matsatsi a mararo feela.
Yet he could not.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a sa khone.
I have no way of knowing.	Ha ke na mokhoa oa ho tseba.
So much for space.	Haholo sebakeng.
No situation is exactly the same.	Ha ho boemo bo tšoanang hantle.
I'm not so sure.	Ha ke na bonnete haholo.
Not much else happened.	Ha ho tse ling tse ngata tse etsahetseng.
They are really trying to start the whole thing again.	Ba hlile ba leka ho qala ntho eo kaofela hape.
Stop right here.	Ema hona mona.
I am a man.	Ke monna.
He knew exactly what he was talking about.	O ne a tseba hantle seo a neng a bua ka sona.
He was the father of many children.	E ne e le ntate oa bana ba bangata.
He did it.	O e entse.
He has it right there.	O na le eona hona moo.
I can see that it is him even though he is behind it.	Kea bona hore ke eena leha a le ka morao.
And it just so happens to look so good.	'Me ho etsahala feela ho shebahala hantle haholo.
He told me that our parents are not really our parents.	O ile a mpolella hore batsoali ba rōna ha e le hantle hase batsoali ba rōna.
She cried.	O ile a lla.
He knew exactly what he wanted.	O ne a tseba hantle seo a se batlang.
However, buy this book.	Leha ho le joalo, reka buka ena.
All good parents should try to find them.	Batsoali bohle ba molemo ba lokela ho leka ho ba batle.
Or you.	Kapa uena.
This teacher is always easy for children.	Tichere ena e lula e le bonolo ho bana.
He decided to quit.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho e tlohela.
Your second.	Ea hao ea bobeli.
However, they both spoke.	Leha ho le joalo, ka bobeli ba ile ba bua.
No one can know.	Ha ho motho ea ka tsebang.
This we may not do.	Sena re ka 'na ra se ke ra se etsa.
So he would speak.	Kahoo o ne a tla bua.
This line is too bad.	Mohala ona o mpe haholo.
He thought it would make him money.	O ne a nahana hore e tla mo etsetsa chelete.
I was afraid of him.	Ke ne ke mo tšaba.
We said yes.	Re itse ho joalo.
His reason told him that it was indeed the best.	Lebaka la hae le ile la mo bolella hore ka sebele ho molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Several times that, of course.	Ka makhetlo a 'maloa hoo, ha e le hantle.
They want to be able to be whatever they want to be or anyone.	Ba rata ho khona ho ba eng kapa eng eo ba e batlang kapa mang kapa mang.
I thought that was their life.	Ke ne ke nahana hore boo ke bophelo ba bona.
I see no reason to continue.	Ha ke bone lebaka la ho tsoela pele.
It was clear.	Ho ne ho hlakile.
That is the most important thing right now.	Ke eona ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa hona joale.
It really isn't that hard.	Ehlile ha e thata hakaalo.
I find them very powerful.	Ke li fumana li le matla haholo.
He thought about it.	O ile a nahana ka eona.
They start giving things.	Ba qala ho fana ka lintho.
That is another benefit of being in a team.	Oo ke molemo o mong oa ho ba sehlopheng.
I read it.	Ke ile ka e bala.
Yet he did not have it.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a se na eona.
I don't have to go anywhere.	Ha ho hlokahale hore ke ee kae kapa kae.
It's never close.	Ha e eso be haufi.
They passed my parents' bedroom.	Ba ile ba feta phaposing ea ho robala ea batsoali ba ka.
She fixed her hair.	O ile a lokisa moriri oa hae.
He seemed indifferent.	O ne a bonahala a sa tsotelle.
However, it is not so simple.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
People still want to dress like me.	Batho ba ntse ba batla ho apara joaloka 'na.
They just want to live.	Ba batla ho phela feela.
He could not say it.	O ne a ke ke a e bua.
She speaks better.	O bua betere.
However, this should not be the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha sea lokela ho ba joalo.
I just used my stuff.	Ke sa tsoa sebelisa lintho tsa ka.
I went to see it last night.	Ke ile ho e bona maobane bosiu.
I understand that this was the case.	Kea utloisisa hore sena se ne se le joalo.
So he refused to drink it.	Ka hona a hana ho a noa.
Some believe that they exist because of another.	Ba bang ba lumela hore ba teng ka lebaka la e mong.
The people here make a lot of money	Batho ba mona ba fumana chelete e ngata
It's not just here.	Ha se mona feela.
It was his first real job.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa hae oa pele oa sebele.
They did not leave.	Ha ba ka ba tloha.
Love your friends.	Rata metsoalle ea hao.
That has never happened, ever.	Seo ha se e-so ka se etsahala, le ka mohla.
Many more.	Tse ling tse ngata.
I met him before.	Ke kopane le eena pele.
And we can talk about that a little bit.	Mme re ka bua ka seo hanyane.
He was gone.	O ne a ile.
And nothing came.	Mme ha ho letho le ileng la tla.
We are not sure.	Ha re na bonnete.
I want you to find your children.	Ke batla hore o fumane bana ba hau.
There are simple things we can do.	Ho na le lintho tse bonolo tseo re ka li etsang.
However, it could have been worse.	Leha ho le joalo, e ka be e bile mpe le ho feta.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha ea lokela.
So that's what we have now.	Kahoo ke seo re nang le sona hona joale.
It is not what you wanted at all.	Ha se seo o neng o se batla ho hang.
You will be glad you did.	U tla thabela hore ebe u entse joalo.
Of course, that does not seem to be the case.	Ha e le hantle, ho bonahala ho se joalo.
They certainly started it.	Ka sebele ba ile ba e qala.
They are always children.	Ba lula e le bana kamehla.
It will not be difficult to know which one it is.	Ho ke ke ha ba thata ho tseba hore na ke efe.
The team continues to work in the background, however.	Sehlopha se ntse se tsoela pele ho sebetsa ka morao, leha ho le joalo.
I have a strange problem.	Ke na le bothata bo makatsang.
They really don't care about you.	Ha ba hlile ha ba na taba le wena.
It's up to us and we'll take care of it.	Ho tsoa ho rona 'me re tla e hlokomela.
There is good and bad news.	Ho na le litaba tse monate le tse mpe.
He was dressed, and carefully.	O ne a apere, mme ka hloko.
Then here.	Ebe mona.
So it has to go.	E le hore e lokela ho tsamaea.
Or because they do.	Kapa hobane ba etsa joalo.
I had no problem with him.	Ke ne ke se na bothata le eena.
I was just there.	Ke ne ke le moo feela.
That was the only way.	E ne e le eona feela tsela.
The police are there now.	Mapolesa a teng hona joale.
Sometimes, that only takes time.	Ka linako tse ling, seo se nka nako feela.
I will find it again.	Ke tla e fumana hape.
He refused to stand.	O ile a hana ho ema.
However, one person was absent.	Leha ho le joalo, motho a le mong o ne a le sieo.
Yes, but we should not tell her mother.	E, empa ha rea ​​​​lokela ho bolella 'mè oa hae.
I have to help others now.	Ke tlameha ho thusa ba bang hona joale.
He did not expect that from me.	O ne a sa lebella seo ho nna.
It's a long way before we get home.	Ke tsela e telele pele re fihla hae.
He did not name it.	Ha aa ka a e bolela ka lebitso.
We feel happy when we do things.	Re ikutloa re thabile ha re etsa lintho.
We do not see anyone anywhere.	Ha re bone motho kae kapa kae.
He was tough.	O ne a le thata.
Still, I enjoyed it.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ile ka e thabela.
She will think that the adult she loves will never do anything wrong.	O tla nahana hore motho e moholo eo a mo ratang a ke ke a etsa letho le phoso.
I thought of taking it.	Ke ile ka nahana ho e nka.
It did not happen.	Ha se ya etsahala.
We will be home next year.	Re tla be re le hae selemong se tlang.
Some work well in each group.	Ba bang ba sebetsa hantle sehlopheng se seng le se seng.
His path was clear.	Tsela ea hae e ne e hlakile.
The new is the old.	E ncha ke ea khale.
You should call the police.	U lokela ho letsetsa mapolesa.
I'll get it soon.	Ke tla e fumana haufinyane.
Don't take advantage of me.	Se nke monyetla ka nna.
He said he had never done that.	O ile a re ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo.
However, you will have to leave soon.	Leha ho le joalo, u tla tlameha ho tsamaea kapele.
Some people write us what you know.	Batho ba bang ba re ngola seo o se tsebang.
He loved that.	O ne a rata seo.
It's very fun.	Ke monate haholo.
He did not even know why he did that.	O ne a sa tsebe le hore na o entse seo hobane'ng.
He didn't have such a thing.	O ne a sena ntho e jwalo.
He had never seen anything like it, either.	O ne a eso bone ntho e kang ena, le hona.
It is of no use to you if you do not get it.	Ho hang ha ho na thuso ho uena haeba u sa e fumane.
But now you have to be careful.	Empa joale u tlameha ho e hlokomela.
And he was still there.	Mme o ne a ntse a le teng.
He would like to travel on time.	A ka rata ho tsamaea ka nako.
It was about three years ago.	E ne e ka ba lilemo tse tharo tse fetileng.
We will have to tell the police.	Re tla tlameha ho bolella mapolesa.
And he almost got it.	Mme a batla a e fumana.
But he had a chance to think.	Empa o ne a e-na le monyetla oa ho nahana.
It certainly was.	Ka sebele ho ne ho le joalo.
He always told me that.	O ne a lula a mpolella joalo.
Very nice stuff.	Lintho tse ntle haholo.
Who is.	Ke mang ea.
Anyone can come with them.	Mang kapa mang a ka tla le tsona.
But let me tell you about it.	Empa e re ke o bolelle taba ena.
I will definitely be back next year !.	Ka 'nete ke tla khutla selemong se tlang!.
I want to know what it is.	Ke batla ho tseba hore na ke eng.
Some know it.	Ba bang ba e tseba.
In fact, it is a place to start.	Ha e le hantle, ke sebaka sa ho qala.
There's somebody here that you need to see.	Ho na le motho e mong eo u lokelang ho mo bona.
Finally, he arrived.	Qetellong, o ile a fihla.
I could not do that.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho etsa joalo.
He loved her.	O ne a mo rata.
Some things were working.	Lintho tse ling li ne li ntse li sebetsa.
You should not drink too much.	Ha ua lokela ho noa haholo.
Probably because of it.	Mohlomong ka lebaka la eona.
It is only a matter of time.	Ke taba ea nako feela.
He worked hard.	O ile a sebetsa ka thata.
But this is still simple.	Empa sena se ntse se le bonolo.
They already know that.	Ba se ba ntse ba tseba seo.
That's what it is.	Ke seo se leng teng.
Reading is my life.	Ho bala ke bophelo ba ka.
I'm sure he doesn't sleep well.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ha a robala hantle.
But pain is another matter.	Empa bohloko ke ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I just wanted to see what would happen.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho bona se tla etsahala.
Maybe we are no longer there.	Mohlomong le rona ha e sa le eo.
However, it is better to call first.	Leha ho le joalo, ho molemo ho letsetsa pele.
His family was finally able to buy him back.	Qetellong lelapa la hae le ile la khona ho mo reka hape.
He did not know it, but he would learn.	O ne a sa e tsebe, empa o ne a tla ithuta.
Some worked, many did not.	Ba bang ba ile ba sebetsa, ba bangata ha baa ka ba sebetsa.
It says something about our team.	E bua ho hong ka sehlopha sa rona.
If you were there, it would not be.	Haeba u ne u le teng, ho ka be ho se joalo.
At one time, it was the same name as the others.	Ka nako e 'ngoe, e ne e le lebitso le tšoanang le a mang.
If there was anything to you.	Haeba ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ho uena.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
This is a very dangerous place to be!	Sena ke sebaka se kotsi haholo ho ba teng!
I do not know when he will return.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o tla khutla neng.
He would have to find it again.	O ne a tla tlameha ho e fumana hape.
No, we haven't talked about it yet.	Che, ha re so bue ka eona.
It was not the way.	E ne e se tsela.
Maybe they were going that way.	Mohlomong ba ne ba tsamaea ka tsela eo.
As you say, no one can know that it exists.	Joalo ka ha u re, ha ho motho ea ka tsebang hore e teng.
If you can stay.	Ha o ka dula.
It won't tell us anything.	E ke ke ea re bolella letho.
They were behind each one of them.	Ba ne ba le ka mora e mong le e mong wa bona.
We have to go.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea.
I think this team has a first position.	Ke nahana hore sehlopha sena se na le boemo ba pele.
We do not know tomorrow.	Ha re tsebe hosane.
To me, that is not a difficult decision to make.	Ho ’na, eo hase qeto e boima ho e etsa.
I will only take my clothes and shoes.	Ke tla nka liaparo tsa ka le lieta feela.
He looked good.	O ne a shebahala hantle.
Everyone else is trying to understand it.	Ba bang kaofela ba leka ho e utloisisa.
There is no reason to do it here.	Ha ho na lebaka la ho e etsa mona.
You seem to know a lot about them.	Ho bonahala o tseba haholo ka bona.
This was the last one.	Ena e ne e le ea ho qetela.
Maybe that’s all it is.	Mohlomong ke sohle seo e leng sona.
Lack of emotion.	Ho hloka maikutlo.
The party started late.	Mokete o ile oa qala ka morao ho nako.
Yes, we did.	E, re ile ra etsa joalo.
I returned home after doing that work.	Ke ile ka khutlela hae ka mor’a ho etsa mosebetsi oo.
What could be better!?.	Ke eng e ka bang betere!?.
You know what you did.	U tseba seo u se entseng.
Then, finally, he opened it.	Joale, qetellong, a bula.
You can take them.	U ka li nka.
Nobody wants to go back to the old place.	Ha ho na motho ea batlang ho khutlela sebakeng sa khale.
The young man was handsome.	Mohlankana eo o ne a shebahala a le motle.
That meant keeping your head down and being a team player.	Seo se ne se bolela ho boloka hlooho ea hau fatše le ho ba sebapali sa sehlopha.
I mean he exists.	Ke bolela hore o teng.
Or here.	Kapa mona.
And always try to do that.	Le ho leka ho etsa joalo kamehla.
We need to talk.	Re hloka ho bua.
They should be able to help you.	Ba lokela ho khona ho u thusa.
Or so he thinks.	Kapa o nahana joalo.
He hoped so.	O ne a tšepa hore ho joalo.
I could not stay with me.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho lula le 'na.
I had no other way to reach him.	Ke ne ke se na mokhoa o mong oa ho mo fihlela.
One is to buy it from the past.	E 'ngoe ke hore u e'o e reka ho tloha nakong e fetileng.
Her children loved her.	Bana ba hae ba ne ba mo rata.
I really like that.	Ke hlile ke rata seo.
He told her he would look at it.	O ile a mo bolella hore o tla e sheba.
It will be difficult for him.	Ho tla ba thata ho eena.
I think you know him.	Ke nahana hore oa mo tseba.
I see it.	Kea e bona.
But it is.	Empa ho joalo.
It's not hard.	Ha ho thata.
Or maybe both.	Kapa mohlomong ka bobeli.
I will be back to your place again.	Ke tla khutlela sebakeng sa hau hape.
They are really mine, but they are close to me.	Ha e le hantle ke ba ka, empa ba haufi le 'na.
Which was right for me, of course.	E neng e le hantle ho 'na, ho hlakile.
He, too, did not know.	Le eena, u ne u sa tsebe.
The issue is clear.	Taba e hlakile.
They say it takes time.	Ba re ho nka nako.
It will work soon.	E tla sebetsa haufinyane.
You both look tired.	Ka bobeli le shebahala le khathetse.
More than now, more than that.	Ho feta hona joale, ho feta moo.
He could feel better.	O ne a ka ikutloa a le betere.
Now we decide.	Joale re etsa qeto.
It could be his.	E ka ba ea hae.
The decision was yours.	Qeto e bile ea hao.
That wasn't so bad.	Seo se ne se se mpe hakaalo.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho tsamaea joale.
This was the last stop.	Ena e ne e le sebaka sa ho qetela sa ho ema.
I need to spend time learning more or understanding more.	Ke hloka ho qeta nako ke ithuta haholoanyane kapa ho utloisisa haholoanyane.
It was in a room.	E ne e le ka kamoreng.
We'll meet again soon.	Re kopana hape haufinyane.
We do not see it that way.	Ha re bone ho le joalo.
Sometimes it is very difficult.	Ka linako tse ling e thata haholo.
This is very difficult to do.	Sena se thata haholo ho se etsa.
It was really clear.	E ne e hlile e hlakile.
I'm just glad to see you.	Ke thabela ho o bona feela.
This is more than surprising thank you very much man.	Sena se feta se makatsang ke leboha haholo monna.
Of course, there is the car.	Ehlile, koloi ke eo.
He can do anything.	A ka etsa eng kapa eng.
I was close to him.	Ke ne ke le haufi le eena.
I could have stayed up until tomorrow.	Nka be ke ile ka ema ho fihlela hosane.
It does this well.	E etsa sena hantle.
It was a wonderful time.	E ne e le nako e monate.
But he stayed at his job.	Empa o ile a dula mosebetsing wa hae.
They made a good team.	Ba entse sehlopha se setle.
No, he did not tell anyone.	Che, ha aa ka a bolella motho.
It was there.	E bile teng.
We had seen the first and second.	Re ne re bone ea pele le ea bobeli.
And maybe he can.	'Me mohlomong a ka khona.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
But then there was none.	Empa joale ho ne ho se na.
What made you decide to retire?	Ke eng e entseng hore u etse qeto ea ho tlohela mosebetsi?
There was no way to just get in.	Ho ne ho se na tsela ea ho kena feela.
That's the law.	Ke molao.
They could do nothing.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba etsa letho.
He drank for a week.	O ne a noa ka bekeng.
In just three days.	Ka matsatsi a mararo feela.
It really is better than the others, but it is still not good.	Ehlile e ntle ho feta tse ling, empa leha ho le joalo ha e ntle.
So nobody had a car like the one they had.	Kahoo ha ho motho ea nang le koloi e tšoanang le eo ba neng ba e-na le eona.
You do not have to thank us.	Ha ua tlameha ho re leboha.
What he did not know was the reason.	Seo a neng a sa se tsebe ke lebaka.
Tell us what you think.	Re bolelle seo u se nahanang.
But he refused to come.	Empa e ne e hana ho tla.
But you will learn to talk about time.	Empa o tla ithuta ho bua ka nako.
The one who comes first is usually the person, though not always.	Motho ea tlang pele hangata ke motho, le hoja e se kamehla.
I never tried to find my mother.	Ha kea ka ka leka ho fumana 'Mè.
I'm not crying anymore.	Ha ke sa lla.
It didn't seem to matter.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na taba.
Each team had a task to do.	Sehlopha ka seng se ne se e-na le mosebetsi oo se lokelang ho o etsa.
I loved both of them.	Ke ne ke ba rata ka bobeli.
He says now is not a good time.	O re hona joale ha se nako e ntle.
I just had to say things carefully.	Ke ne ke tlameha feela ho bua lintho ka hloko.
He knew about this but it didn't help in any way.	O ne a tseba ka sena empa ha hoa ka ha thusa ka tsela e itseng.
We're done.	Re qetile.
The team played until very late at night.	Sehlopha se ile sa bapala ho fihlela bosiu haholo.
I didn't want to tell anyone.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho bolella mang kapa mang.
It is not an easy thing to do.	Ha se ntho e bonolo ho e etsa.
It is important to read, read and re-read.	Ho bohlokoa ho bala, ho bala le ho bala hape.
That will save us.	Seo se tla re boloka.
Notice a certain man.	Hlokomela monna ya itseng.
I always did nothing.	ke ne ke lula ke sa etse letho.
But he must come.	Empa o tlameha ho tla.
He does this kind of thing over and over again.	O etsa ntho ea mofuta ona hangata.
The children were singing as they sang.	Bana ba ne ba bina ha ba ntse ba bina.
This was my favorite.	Ena e ne e le eo ke e ratang haholo.
However, no one does that.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho ea etsang joalo.
You pass.	U feta.
He took good care of his home.	O ne a hlokomela ntlo ea hae haholo.
Plan not to go anywhere.	Rera hore u se ke ua fihla kae kapa kae.
Moreover, he did not believe it.	Ho feta moo, ha aa ka a lumela hore e teng.
There will be a big party.	Ho tla ba le mokete o moholo.
Quitting is not something you just do once.	Ho tlohela ha se ntho eo o e etsang hang feela.
He hears it a little.	O e utloa hanyane.
We are talking about that.	Re bua ka seo.
You have to give it up.	U tlameha ho fana ka eona.
Because you do not have it.	Hobane ha u na eona.
I asked him what that meant.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na hoo ho ne ho bolela eng.
It takes several hours to travel.	Ho hlokahala lihora tse 'maloa tsa ho tsamaea.
Everyone knew that.	E mong le e mong o ne a tseba seo.
We never thought of living anywhere.	Re ne re e-s’o ka re nahana ho lula kae kapa kae.
Thanks for standing up.	Ke leboha ho ema.
I know what you want to ask.	Ke tseba seo o batlang ho se botsa.
He is only there for me.	O teng feela ho nna.
We haven't seen many more yet.	Ha re so bone tse ngata hape.
You knew better.	U ne u tseba ho feta.
He knows his condition.	O tseba boemo ba hae.
You can do something like this.	U ka etsa ntho e kang ena.
They are healthy.	Ba phela hantle.
I try to find them.	Ke leka ho li fumana.
Please stay with it.	Ke kopa o lule le eona.
Nothing happened.	Ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala.
But these are still very early days.	Empa ena e ntse e le matsatsi a pele haholo.
Of course you know about it.	Ka 'nete u tseba ka eona.
Life.	Bophelo.
It may be some help.	E ka 'na ea e-ba thuso e itseng.
My children loved it.	Bana ba ka ba ne ba e rata haholo.
There is still room for it in my head.	Ho sa na le sebaka ho eona bakeng sa hlooho ea ka.
I just didn't know how or why.	Ke ne ke mpa ke sa tsebe hore na ke joang kapa hobane’ng.
He drinks water before meals.	O noa metsi pele ho lijo.
And it will do nothing.	'Me e ke ke ea etsa letho.
But it works just as well.	Empa e sebetsa hantle ka tsela e tšoanang.
I took my time eating it.	Ke nkile nako ea ka ke e ja.
He is not alone.	Ha se eena feela.
Then this would not have happened.	Joale sena se ka be se sa etsahala.
There is no work for you there.	Ha ho na mosebetsi bakeng sa hau moo.
But he did not leave his wife.	Empa ha aa ka a tlohela mosali oa hae.
It's your money.	Ke chelete ea hau.
Do it as often as you can.	Etsa hangata kamoo u ka khonang.
There is one of us.	Ho na le e mong oa rona.
They get what they need from someone else.	Ba fumana seo ba se hlokang ho e mong.
If there is one place there may be others.	Haeba ho na le sebaka se le seng ho ka ba le tse ling.
I am learning my status.	Ke ithuta boemo ba ka.
His family did not know where he was.	Lelapa la hae le ne le sa tsebe moo a leng teng.
I will have my coffee ahead of time.	Ke tla noa kofi ea ka pele ho nako.
I'm not just talking.	Ha ke bue feela.
I was just a man.	Ke ne ke le monna feela.
He will go with you if you like.	O tla tsamaea le uena ha u rata.
Yet he had been here before, it seemed.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a kile a fihla mona, ho ne ho bonahala.
It was fun.	E ne e le monate.
We do not understand this.	Ha re utloisise sena.
I feel tired.	Ke ikutloa ke khathetse.
This is something no one likes to do.	Ena ke ntho eo ho seng motho ea ratang ho e etsa.
You never know what you'll get!	Ha u tsebe hore na u tla fumana eng!
However, my mother is helpless.	Leha ho le joalo, 'Mè ha a na thuso.
I love that name so much.	Ke rata lebitso leo haholo.
So you will have to learn again.	Kahoo u tla tlameha ho ithuta hape.
I know that.	Kea tseba ho joalo.
There was no one there.	Ho ne ho se na motho.
I did not expect to do that.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore re tla etsa joalo.
But, it is still difficult.	Empa, ho ntse ho le thata.
That's exactly right.	Ke hona moo hantle.
No one told me to leave.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a itse ke tsamaee.
I like nice clothes.	Ke rata liaparo tse ntle.
We will do just that.	Re tla etsa joalo feela.
Well, of course.	Joalo, ka 'nete.
I was just thinking.	Ke ne ke nahana feela.
Of course, it is very difficult.	Ha e le hantle, ho thata haholo.
I can't keep it.	Ha ke khone ho e boloka.
I have to get it all right.	Ke tlameha ho fumana tsohle hantle.
But maybe that was my fault.	Empa mohlomong eo e ne e le phoso ea ka.
It was the same with his.	Ho bile joalo le ka ea hae.
The news was real.	Litaba e ne e le tsa sebele.
He knew both of them.	O ne a li tseba ka bobeli.
I find the same error exactly as before.	Ke fumana phoso e tšoanang hantle le pele.
I thought you had just arrived here.	Ke ne ke nahana hore u sa tsoa fihla mona.
I want to take my wife with me.	Ke batla ho nka mosali oa ka le 'na.
Maybe my wife.	Mohlomong mosali oa ka.
The woman knew nothing about it.	Mosali o ne a sa tsebe letho ka eona.
I was in good health.	Ke ne ke phela hantle.
However, I have heard a lot.	Leha ho le joalo, ke utloile haholo.
And to save lives.	Le ho boloka bophelo.
The car is still there.	Koloi e ntse e le eona.
We do not know what happened to them.	Ha re tsebe se ileng sa etsahala ka bona.
What happened to them? 	Ho ile ha etsahala’ng ka bona?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
I thought we were playing hard.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re bapala ka thata.
They had finally found him.	Qetellong ba ne ba mo fumane.
They wonder why.	Ba ipotsa hore na hobaneng.
She is crying.	O ntse a lla.
But many of them do.	Empa ba bangata ba bona ba etsa joalo.
Everyone is always looking for more than ever.	Motho e mong le e mong o lula a batla ho feta ha ho mohla e lekaneng.
Good way.	Tsela e ntle.
This seemed too good to be true.	Sena se ne se bonahala se le monate haholo hore e ka ba ’nete.
Today she was thankful for not being alone.	Kajeno o ne a leboha ho se be mong.
I asked him my name.	Ke ile ka mo botsa lebitso la ka.
And to me.	Le ho nna.
I didn't care.	Ke ne ke se na taba.
You can see it all from there.	U ka bona tsohle ho tloha moo.
It had to be easy.	E ne e lokela ho ba bonolo.
He knew his wife by name.	O ne a tseba mosali oa hae ka lebitso la hae.
To work or play, it is important to get enough sleep.	Ho sebetsa kapa ho bapala, ho bohlokoa ho robala ka ho lekaneng.
They continue reading.	Ba tsoela pele ho bala.
It was not easy to leave.	Ho ne ho se bonolo ho tloha.
He soon realized that he had a drinking problem.	Kapele o ile a hlokomela hore o na le bothata ba ho noa.
Still, he enjoyed the news.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a thabela litaba tseo.
He had never liked it.	O ne a e-s'o ka a rata.
So, go this way.	Ka hona, tsamaea ka tsela ena.
And it still hurts.	Mme e ntse e le bohloko.
I would like something.	Ke kopa ho hong.
I could not work.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho sebetsa.
He got it.	O e fumane.
Is that too much to ask?	Na ho joalo haholo ho botsa?
I really don't want to talk about it.	Ruri ha ke batle ho bua ka eona.
They have very tasty food.	Ba na le lijo tse monate haholo.
You have enough money to travel.	U na le chelete e lekaneng ho tsamaea feela.
And many more.	Le tse ling tse ngata.
You do not know exactly what it is about.	Ha u e-so tsebe hantle hore na e bua ka eng.
There is so much for everyone.	Ho na le tse ngata ho motho e mong le e mong.
Who are they?	Ke bo mang?
However, you will have to do some work.	Leha ho le joalo, u tla tlameha ho etsa mosebetsi o itseng.
I really like these people.	Ke rata batho bana haholo.
We wanted to see that happen.	Re ne re batla ho bona seo se etsahala.
Thanks I will see you tomorrow !.	Kea leboha ke tla u bona hosane!.
I found him.	Ke mo fumane.
Not a lot of head.	Hase hlooho e ngata.
I mean all.	Ke bolela kaofela.
He just couldn't do it.	O ne a ke ke a e etsa feela.
All of those things are real.	Lintho tseo kaofela ke tsa sebele.
That's my subject.	Ke taba ea ka eo.
I loved her.	Ke ne ke mo rata.
He said it was still difficult to move on.	O ile a re ho ntse ho e-ba thata ho tsoela pele.
He really looked good.	O ne a hlile a shebahala hantle.
Plus, you'll look your best.	Ho feta moo, o tla shebahala o le motle haholo.
I had no idea what that thing was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ntho eo ke efe.
They were not difficult to understand.	Li ne li se thata ho li utloisisa.
You may already be working on them.	E ka 'na eaba u se u ntse u sebetsa ho tsona.
I could not see what was happening to them.	Ke ne ke sa bone se ileng sa etsahala ka bona.
But you know that it will pass.	Empa ua tseba hore seo se tla feta.
No, he does not.	Che, ha a etse joalo.
I can't understand it.	Ha ke khone ho e utloisisa.
Maybe he didn't read well, he thought.	Mohlomong o ne a sa bala hantle, a nahana.
He knows everything.	O tseba tsohle.
Or simple.	Kapa e bonolo.
You better go with me.	Ho molemo hore u tsamaee le 'na.
Where he is when he is not with you.	Moo a leng teng ha a se na le wena.
My mother went there.	'Mè o ile a ea moo.
Obviously, this was nothing new.	Ho hlakile hore sena e ne e se ntho e ncha.
Stay right here.	U lule mona hantle.
But it was not there.	Empa e ne e le sieo.
Simply refusing was not enough.	Ho hana feela ho ne ho sa lekana.
It was years and years ago.	E ne e le lilemo le lilemo tse fetileng.
Besides, it is not too late.	Ntle le moo, ha se e se e le morao haholo.
He tried them all.	A li leka kaofela.
You have a decision to make.	U na le qeto eo u lokelang ho e etsa.
He saw what he did.	O ile a bona seo a se entseng.
Yes, they have their days like most kids.	E, ba na le matsatsi a bona joalo ka bana ba bangata.
It may not happen, but it does.	Ho ka 'na ha se ke ha etsahala, empa hoa etsahala.
I hope it helps.	Ke tšepa hore e thusa.
They want fun.	Ba batla monate.
But he trusted them.	Empa o ne a ba tšepa.
Tonight.	Bosiu ba kajeno.
Everyone was very helpful.	E mong le e mong o ne a thusa haholo.
I wish you could read this.	Ke lakatsa eka o ka bala sena.
Anything other than this.	Eng kapa eng ntle le sena.
She was delicious.	O ne a le monate.
But it gets there.	Empa e ea fihla moo.
For the same reason.	Ka lebaka le tšoanang.
I'm trying to do something good.	Ke leka ho etsa ntho e ntle.
I hope you are well.	Ke tšepa hore u ntse u phela hantle.
There was something wrong.	Ho ne ho ena le phoso.
Which was really good for me.	E neng e hlile e le molemo ho 'na.
They will find you.	Ba tla o fumana.
In the end, only time will tell.	Qetellong, ke nako feela e tla bolela.
Must have them.	E tlameha ho ba le tsona.
But do not do that.	Empa o seke oa etsa joalo.
But it is time for you to meet again.	Empa ke nako ea hore le kopane.
And here it is.	Mme ke sena.
He never mentioned his family.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka lelapa la hae.
Buy this book.	Reka buka ena.
I believe in myself more.	Ke lumela ho 'na ho feta.
But it doesn't seem to me.	Empa ha ho bonahale ho nna.
Maybe it was.	Mohlomong e bile.
I have a lot of hers.	Ke na le tse ngata tsa hae.
You have done wonderful things.	U entse tse makatsang.
But this situation is beyond me.	Empa boemo bona bo mpheta.
I would love to do it this way.	Ke tla thabela ho e etsa ka tsela ena.
I want to see you come.	Ke batla ho o bona o tla.
He would just be fine.	O ne a tla phela hantle feela.
It does not require any other work to work.	Ha e hloke mosebetsi o mong ho sebetsa.
I already have enough money.	Ke se ke na le chelete e lekaneng.
I hope you can help.	Kea tšepa le ka thusa.
Many found it difficult to keep up with them.	Ba bangata ba ne ba le thata ho tsoela pele le bona.
But that night he was very happy.	Empa bosiung boo o ne a thabile haholo.
Surprisingly, they were.	Ho makatsang ke hore ba ne ba le joalo.
Sorry to hear about your problems.	Ke masoabi ho utloa ka mathata a hau.
It is very difficult.	Ho thata haholo.
My children, too.	Bana ba ka, le bona.
I found some really.	Ke fumane tse ling ehlile.
We realized.	Re ile ra hlokomela.
Her parents were very strict.	Batsoali ba hae ba ne ba le thata haholo.
They did so.	Ba ile ba etsa joalo.
Why he was talking, he did not know.	Hobaneng a ne a ntse a bua, o ne a sa tsebe.
I'm asking for your opinion.	Ke kopa maikutlo a hau.
We have been here.	Re bile mona.
I spent some time there.	Ke ile ka qeta nako e itseng moo.
Do not read too much.	U se ke ua e bala haholo.
In this way he would be strong.	Ka tsela ena o ne a tla ba matla.
Nothing happened here.	Ha ho letho le etsahetseng mona.
You have just begun to learn something.	U sa tsoa qala ho ithuta ho hong.
And so we went.	Mme kahoo ra ya.
Thanks for that question.	Ke leboha potso eo.
It's nice to see them together.	Ho monate ho ba bona hammoho.
However, it has been dangerous.	Leha ho le joalo, e bile kotsi.
Not just because of what it does to her.	E seng feela ka lebaka la seo e se etsang ho eena.
It took him a few hours.	Ho ile ha mo nka lihora tse seng kae.
You will be back.	U tla khutla.
He wants to tell them.	O batla ho ba bolella.
He had found them.	O ne a ba fumane.
The water was clear.	Metsi a ne a hlakile.
I felt very tired.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke khathetse haholo.
My mother also took them from me.	’Mè le eena o li nkile ho ’na.
And there are regrets.	'Me ho e-na le masoabi.
This is truly a picture of life.	Sena ke 'nete setšoantšo sa bophelo.
Keep up the good work.	Tsoela pele ka mosebetsi oa hau.
Nothing ever happened.	Ha ho letho le kileng la ba teng.
My father was crying.	Ntate o ne a lla.
He was the one who played those until he died.	Ke eena ea neng a bapala tseo ho fihlela a hlokahala.
We would have to pay him, of course.	Re ne re tla tlameha ho mo lefa, ehlile.
It comes out in style.	E tsoa ka mokhoa.
But he wanted them to do that.	Empa o ne a batla hore ba etse joalo.
It was fun to have a back.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba le morao.
But he was there.	Empa o ne a le teng.
I love being with them.	Ke rata ho ba le bona.
I think you are too.	Ke nahana hore le wena o jwalo.
I can live well.	Ke khona ho phela hantle.
He may be the only one who will enjoy it.	E ka 'na eaba ke eena feela ea tla e thabela.
And we're starting to work hard to fix it.	Mme re qala ho sebetsa hantle ho e lokisa.
They have a lot to learn from each other.	Ba na le lintho tse ngata tseo ba lokelang ho ithuta tsona ho e mong.
Look at those.	Sheba tseo.
We are doing work.	Re ntse re etsa mosebetsi.
We went there last year.	Re ile teng selemong se fetileng.
He does not want her to leave now.	Ha a batle hore a tsamaee hona joale.
someone asked.	motho a botsa.
So we do not.	Kahoo ha re etse joalo.
The rest of us are trying to move on.	Ba bang kaofela ba rona re leka ho tsoela pele.
He spends a lot of time alone.	O qeta nako e ngata haholo a le mong.
He did not have much time.	O ne a sena nako e ngata.
He tried to figure out what to do next.	O ile a leka ho nahana hore na a ka etsa’ng ka mor’a moo.
I can stay somewhere tonight.	Nka lula sebakeng se seng bosiung bona.
They can go either way.	Ba ka ea ka tsela efe kapa efe.
In his absence he worked.	Ha a le sieo o ne a sebetsa.
And that is not the case.	Mme haho jwalo.
Now the situation was very close to home.	Joale boemo bo ne bo se bo le haufi haholo le hae.
That's what it is.	Ke eona taba eo.
We just want to win.	Re mpa re batla ho hlola.
Those who could not suffer where they were.	Ba neng ba sa khone ho utloa bohloko moo ba neng ba le teng.
But that is not your problem.	Empa ha se bothata ba hau.
I think he does a very good job.	Ke nahana hore o etsa mosebetsi o motle haholo.
My real dad and I don’t do that.	'Na le ntate oa ka oa sebele ha re etse joalo.
We have to do that.	Re lokela ho etsa seo.
And that is what they did.	Mme ke seo ba ileng ba se etsa.
He did not want to do anything to help them.	O ne a sa batle ho etsa letho ho ba thusa.
Like you.	Joalo ka uena.
Before it is too late.	Pele e eba morao haholo.
But the money was not worth it.	Empa chelete eo e ne e se ea bohlokoa.
This was about to open the door to his room.	Sena se ne se le haufi le ho bula lemati la kamore ea hae.
Give your room and go with me.	Fana ka kamore ea hau 'me u tsamaee le' na.
I didn't get a chance to ask him.	Ha kea ka ka fumana monyetla oa ho mo botsa.
Use "you" when talking about someone.	Sebelisa "uena" ha re bua ka motho e mong.
It was hard work.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima.
My picture seemed complicated.	Setšoantšo sa ka se ne se bonahala se le thata.
But he had to do it.	Empa o ne a tlameha ho etsa joalo.
We had the best time there.	Re bile le nako e monate ka ho fetisisa moo.
He had to go on.	O ne a lokela ho ya pele.
And so it starts.	'Me kahoo e qala.
They know where they were.	Ba tseba moo ba neng ba le teng.
It was a liquid thing.	E ne e le ntho ea metsi.
You could have stayed with me.	O ka be o ile wa dula le nna.
This week there will be a lot of questions.	Bekeng ena ho tla ba le lipotso tse ngata haholo.
I would not want to come to.	Ke ne nke ke ka batla ho tla ho.
I make sure of that.	Ke etsa bonnete ba seo.
He was alive.	O ne a phela.
If you have to.	Haeba u tlameha.
A good place to start.	Sebaka se setle sa ho qala.
This would not be easy to understand.	Sena se ne se ke ke sa e-ba bonolo feela ho se utloisisa.
In time, some of them began talking.	Ha nako e ntse e ea, ba bang ba bona ba ile ba qala ho bua.
It is nothing more than that.	Ha se letho ho feta moo.
It was just true.	E ne e le 'nete feela.
Just in case you didn’t know, it doesn’t.	Feela haeba u ne u sa tsebe, ha ho joalo.
He looked good.	O ne a shebahala hantle.
It was the first time I had seen him.	Ke ne ke qala ho mo bona.
I try my best, but I am not thankful.	Ke leka hantle, empa ha kea leboha.
There was a lot of money in it.	Ho ne ho e-na le chelete e ngata haholo ho eona.
He would just want to look at it.	O ne a tla batla ho e sheba feela.
If there was a situation of sorts.	Haeba ho ne ho e-na le boemo ba mofuta.
I allowed this idea to continue for years.	Ke ile ka lumella mohopolo ona hore o be teng ka lilemo tse ngata.
He could not do it alone.	O ne a sa khone ho e etsa a le mong.
She is an amazing girl.	Ke ngoanana ea makatsang.
Everyone looked at him.	Bohle ba ile ba mo sheba.
I was not.	Ke ne ke se eona.
He would be home a week later.	O ne a tla be a le hae ka mor'a beke.
It may even be necessary.	E ka ba ea hlokahala.
He is the one who comes first in time.	Ke eena ea tlang pele ka nako.
They were playing everything that everyone wanted to hear.	Ba ne ba bapala ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe eo bohle ba neng ba batla ho e utloa.
And it's not because it's easy.	Mme ha se hobane ho le bonolo.
I can no longer write.	Ha ke sa khona ho ngola.
Just go on with life.	Tsoela pele ka bophelo feela.
He could have just gone home.	A ka be a ile hae feela.
Tonight, it's too much.	Bosiung bona, e ngata haholo.
He did not expect to see them again.	O ne a sa lebella ho ba bona hape.
Everyone knows now.	E mong le e mong oa tseba hona joale.
I will not go anywhere.	Ha ke na ho ea kae kapa kae.
I thought of crying.	Ke ile ka nahana ho lla.
They were essential to our survival.	E ne e le tsa bohlokoa bakeng sa ho phela ha rōna.
That doesn't help anyone, none of us.	Seo ha se na thuso ho mang kapa mang, ha ho le ea mong oa rona.
It’s exactly the same way.	Ke ka tsela e tšoanang hantle.
All I need is one thing.	Seo ke se hlokang ke ntho e le 'ngoe.
In the end, it was me.	Qetellong, e ne e le ’na.
But he is still saying that.	Empa o ntse a bua joalo.
Some work well.	Ba bang ba sebetsa hantle.
I hope people will like it.	Ke tšepa hore batho ba tla e rata.
Closer than we think sometime.	Haufi ho feta kamoo re nahanang ka nako e 'ngoe.
For food, or to buy groceries.	Bakeng sa lijo, kapa ho reka lijo tsa lijo.
I did the same.	Ke entse joalo le 'na.
This is a fact.	Taba ena ke 'nete.
We are working to fix the problem.	Re sebetsa ho lokisa bothata.
They do not have to know it very well.	Ha ba a tlameha ho e tseba hantle.
Come with me.	Tsamaea le 'na.
We would appreciate an opportunity to look into this matter further.	Re ka thabela monyetla oa ho sheba taba ena haholoanyane.
But they are not there now.	Empa ha ba eo hona joale.
I would not ask for help or things.	Ke ne nke ke ka kopa thuso kapa lintho.
Today he is with you.	Kajeno le na le uena.
Now, come in.	Jwale, kena.
Whether they win today or not.	Hore na ba hlola kajeno kapa che.
She is a very talkative woman.	Ke mosali ea buang haholo.
That is something that can happen now.	Ke ntho e ka etsahalang hona joale.
It's as clear as the sun.	Ho hlakile joalo ka letsatsi.
To me I feel good.	Ho 'na ke ikutloa ke le monate.
The child, he said, "managed" to go to kindergarten.	Ngoana, o ile a re, "o ile a khona" ho ea sekolong sa bana.
Then he realized.	Eaba oa hlokomela.
And see them.	Mme o ba bone.
My whole life has been for you.	Bophelo bohle ba ka e bile bakeng sa hau.
Thirty years before that, probably.	Lilemo tse mashome a mararo pele ho moo, mohlomong.
It is a very important thing.	Ke ntho ea bohlokoa haholo.
You know why.	U tseba lebaka.
My mind certainly worked.	Ka sebele maikutlo a ka a ile a sebetsa.
It's fun	Ho monate
He was healthy.	O ne a phela hantle.
You can let it go.	U ka e tlohela.
That is what the truth is.	Ke seo 'nete e leng sona.
I see the problem.	Ke bona bothata.
A search party is definitely coming.	Ka sebele mokete oa ho batla o tla tla.
She's really good, but she has nothing to do with it.	Ruri o motle, empa ho hang ha a na seo a se etsang.
We love both of them.	Re li rata ka bobeli.
You must come with me.	O tlameha ho tla le nna.
I do that.	Ke etsa seo.
They are old and true friends.	Ke metsoalle ea khale le ea 'nete.
It wants me to be a girl in it.	E batla hore ke be ngoanana ho eona.
However, that is probably not the case for everyone.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong ha ho joalo ho bohle.
It was fun for them.	Ho ne ho le monate ho bona.
There is nothing we can do about it.	Ha ho letho leo re ka le etsang ka eona.
Put on your shoes.	Apara lieta tsa hao.
Or we go forward.	Kapa re ea pele.
I've never been with you.	Ha ke eso be teng le nna.
Nice to hear from you.	Ho monate ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
So you have to decide.	Kahoo u tlameha ho etsa qeto.
Read the questions carefully.	Bala lipotso ka hloko.
He decided that was not the case.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore ha ho joalo.
I like this one too.	Ke rata le ena.
Everyone is doing the same thing.	Motho e mong le e mong o ntse a etsa lintho tse tšoanang.
It's hard to tell if they really have them.	Ho thata ho tseba hore na ba hlile ba na le tsona.
I think a lot of people do that.	Ke nahana hore batho ba bangata ba etsa joalo.
They enjoy spending their money.	Ba thabela ho sebelisa chelete ea bona.
I find them helpful.	Ke li fumana li thusa.
And we want to talk to you.	Mme re batla ho bua le wena.
Last time.	Nako ea ho qetela.
I studied the picture nearby.	Ke ile ka ithuta setšoantšo se haufi.
Children come in, they.	Bana ba kena, ba.
We will not arrive on time if we do this!	Re ke ke ra fihla ka nako ha re ka etsa sena!
And he will be there.	Mme o tla ba teng.
That's when it happens.	Ke ha e etsahala.
We did nothing.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa letho.
However, they took him away.	Leha ho le joalo, ba mo nka.
However, there was nothing.	Le ha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se na letho.
I could understand it.	Ke ne ke khona ho e utloisisa.
Finally, there is your father.	Qetellong, ntate oa hao ke eo.
A true sense of humor.	Kelello ea 'nete ea 'nete.
It's hard.	E thata.
Money is not important to me.	Chelete ha e bohlokoa ho 'na.
I don't like him very much.	Ha ke mo rate haholo.
Yet that is not the only problem.	Leha ho le joalo hase eona feela bothata.
I catch them.	Kea ba tšoara.
Anything we do is wrong.	Ntho efe kapa efe eo re e etsang ke phoso.
None of that matters.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tseo e leng ea bohlokoa.
It does not exist.	Ha e eo.
However, it did happen.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e kile ea etsahala.
In a way, he was.	Ka tsela e itseng o ne a le joalo.
I did not even know how old he was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe le hore na o lilemo li kae.
Yes, do if you like.	E, etsa haeba u rata.
The time is coming, he thought.	Nako ea tla, a nahana.
Try that.	Leka hoo.
I need highs.	Ke hloka tse phahameng.
I don't see them.	Ha ke ba bone.
Obviously it wasn’t when he was working.	Ho hlakile hore e ne e se ha a ntse a sebetsa.
It is an easy task.	Ke mosebetsi o bonolo.
I had to stay alone.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho lula ke le mong.
It does not matter.	Ha se taba.
It didn’t matter in any way.	Ho ne ho se taba ka tsela efe kapa efe.
He had a very difficult time in it.	O bile le nako e thata haholo ho eona.
There will probably be several of them.	Mohlomong ho tla ba le tse 'maloa tsa tsona.
And tomorrow will be the same.	Le hosane ho tla ba joalo.
He says it's his.	O re ke ea hae.
I'm fine.	Ke phela hantle.
The party continues until nightfall.	Mokete oa tsoela pele ho fihlela bosiu.
I wondered what he was doing.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na o ntse a etsa’ng.
This method is very simple.	Mokhoa ona o bonolo haholo.
I think that's a very good practice.	Ke nahana hore ke mokhoa o motle haholo.
I never thought about it.	Ha kea ka ka nahana ka eona.
Then he noticed it.	Eaba oa e hlokomela.
I did not care to tell the truth.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle ho bua 'nete.
You have to have an idea of ​​it.	U tlameha ho ba le mohopolo oa eona.
Legally he was an adult.	Ka molao e ne e le motho e moholo.
However, he had to agree.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a tlameha ho lumela.
Like a child.	Joalo ka ngoana.
But that is gone now.	Empa seo se ile jwale.
You have to pass.	O tlameha ho feta.
Of course they would.	Ehlile ba ne ba tla etsa joalo.
Of course, it would be better for me.	Ha e le hantle, ho ka ba molemo ho 'na.
This will happen in the end.	Tsena li tla etsahala qetellong.
Only one.	E le 'ngoe feela.
I would love to have you here.	Nka thabela ho ba le uena mona.
Not so with his decision.	Ha se joalo ka ha a entse qeto.
As it is now.	Joalo ka hona joale.
People are beautiful.	Batho ba batle.
You are better than other people.	O molemo ho feta batho ba bang.
I know how it is.	Kea tseba hore na ho joang.
That's another one.	Ke e mong.
And it still is.	Mme e ntse e le teng.
He refused to believe the news.	O ile a hana ho lumela litaba tseo.
It must be soon.	E tlameha ebe haufinyane.
Or when something is hard for a woman.	Kapa ha ntho e le thata ho mosali.
A man must have someone to talk to.	Monna o tlameha ho ba le motho eo a ka buang le eena.
So he cried.	Kahoo, o ile a lla.
They are better, he thought.	Ba betere, a nahana.
Something about them.	Ho hong ka bona.
I hear you.	Kea u utloa.
And all my friends.	Le metsoalle ea ka kaofela.
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le jwalo.
It was a mistake.	E ne e le phoso.
He asked my name.	O ile a botsa lebitso la ka.
What you need.	Seo u se hlokang.
We are not sure how he will do it.	Ha re na bonnete ba hore na o tla e etsa joang.
Bedtime should not be a bad thing, if you can help it.	Nako ea ho robala ha ea lokela ho ba ntho e mpe, haeba u ka e thusa.
And he was not a man.	Hape e ne e se motho.
You start well for me.	O qala hantle ho nna.
We will definitely be back to play again.	Ka sebele re tla khutlela ho bapala hape.
People ask about that.	Batho ba botsa ka seo.
I know things about you too.	Ke tseba lintho ka uena hape.
They were done.	Ba ne ba qetile.
That's their way.	Ke tsela ya bona.
That did not seem so bad.	Seo ha sea ka sa bonahala se le mpe hakaalo.
That's right.	Ke 'nete.
They love him for his work.	Ba mo rata ka mosebetsi oa hae.
Still, the children loved it.	Leha ho le joalo, bana ba ne ba hlile ba li rata.
You just need to play.	O hloka feela ho bapala.
He could work with these people.	O ne a ka sebetsa le batho bana.
I've seen some of them.	Ke bone tse ling tsa tsona.
He was just doing his job.	O ne a etsa mosebetsi oa hae feela.
I am the worst.	Ke 'na ea mpe ka ho fetisisa.
He was doing his job well.	O ne a etsa mosebetsi oa hae hantle.
I was skeptical at first, if that would work.	Ke ne ke belaela pele, haeba seo se ka sebetsa.
And then,.	Mme ka nako eo,.
I think you will enjoy it.	Ke nahana hore o tla e thabela.
We are a group.	Re sehlopha.
All of them.	Kaofela ha bona.
Probably many do not.	Mohlomong ba bangata ha ba etse joalo.
We had wonderful times.	Re bile le linako tse monate.
Only a handful of people lived in the area at that time.	Ke batho ba ’maloa feela ba neng ba lula sebakeng seo ka nako eo.
He never knew before.	Ha eso tsebe pele.
You can't have it all.	U ke ke ua ba le eona kaofela.
However, that is not our case.	Leha ho le joalo, seo ha se taba ea rona.
That it was a group of people.	Hore e ne e le sehlopha sa batho.
Like a woman.	Joalo ka mosali.
It is a very difficult subject.	Ke taba e thata haholo.
I was not sure what to do, or how to fix this.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ke etse eng, kapa hore na nka lokisa sena joang.
But no one is there.	Empa ha ho motho moo.
We wrote down what was most important.	Re ile ra ngola se neng se le bohlokoa haholo.
Because they are important.	Hobane ba bohlokoa.
He finished his meal quickly.	O ile a qeta lijo tsa hae kapele.
He soon understood why.	Kapele o ile a utloisisa lebaka.
He usually eats before going to bed.	Hangata o ja pele a robala.
That’s why we have a job.	Ke kahoo re nang le mosebetsi.
However, I do not know why.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng.
He loved to learn, he loved to read.	O ne a rata ho ithuta, a rata ho bala.
He is talking to me.	O bua le nna.
However, I would not have it.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne nke ke ka ba le eona.
It is good news for the early life.	Ke litaba tse monate bakeng sa bophelo ba pele.
People did not know what to do.	Batho ba ne ba sa tsebe hore na ba etse joang.
We'll have to use that guy again.	Re tla tlameha ho sebelisa mohlankana eo hape.
Yes, he was.	E, o ne a le teng.
Being close to people.	Ho ba haufi le batho.
You do not have to think about that now.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u nahane ka seo hona joale.
They go to work, they go home.	Ba ea mosebetsing, ba khutlela hae.
Still, it is probably good news.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong ke litaba tse monate.
Want to shop there?	O batla ho reka moo?
You need to know everything.	O hloka ho tseba tsohle.
However, that was the second issue.	Leha ho le joalo, eo e ne e le taba ea bobeli.
It is an opportunity to decide what will happen.	Ke monyetla oa ho etsa qeto ea hore na ho tla ba le eng.
He was the eldest son.	E ne e le mora e moholo.
I will continue to use.	Ke tla tsoela pele ho sebelisa.
I feel that.	Ke utloa seo.
I have no further questions.	Ha ke na lipotso tse ling.
All in one place.	Kaofela sebakeng se le seng.
Everything they saw was old.	Sohle seo ba neng ba se bona e ne e le sa khale.
I have seen what some of my friends have gone through.	Ke bone seo ba bang ba metsoalle ea ka ba fetileng ho sona.
Second, get help.	Ea bobeli, fumana thuso.
I loved both of these books.	Ke ne ke rata libuka tsena ka bobeli.
They often do things in a dangerous way.	Hangata ba etsa lintho ka tsela e kotsi.
He is in place.	O sebakeng.
No one else knows, or will know.	Ha ho motho e mong ea tsebang, kapa ea tla tseba.
The other way is just for you.	Tsela e 'ngoe ke ea hau feela.
Well, of course getting in.	Joalo, ka 'nete ho kena.
He was gone.	O ne a ile.
I am telling you good news.	Ke le bolella litaba tse molemo.
I had a lot of fun today.	Ke bile monate haholo kajeno.
We both knew that.	Ka bobeli re ne re tseba seo.
So, try.	Kahoo, leka.
He loved it so much.	O ne a e rata haholo.
That made my day.	Seo se ile sa etsa letsatsi la ka.
You can see this place.	U ka bona sebaka sena.
Have more.	E-ba le tse ling.
I am a worker.	Ke ea sebetsa.
That's just what you are.	Ke seo u leng sona feela.
This can come in time, as a family.	Sena se ka tla ka nako, le le lelapa.
Thinking about.	Ho nahana ka.
Then look at it.	Ebe o e sheba.
This is not very easy to do.	Sena ha se bonolo haholo ho etsahala.
Somehow, he was able to fix his clothes.	Ka tsela e itseng, o ile a khona ho lokisa liaparo tsa hae.
It must.	E tlameha.
The young man was handsome.	Mohlankana eo o ne a le motle.
You can certainly do it.	Ka sebele u ka e etsa.
When you first enter the room.	Ha u qala ho kena ka kamoreng.
They do not eat.	Ha ba je.
Those who need help come to us.	Ba batlang thuso ba tla ho rōna.
You have to buy it now, right now.	U tlameha ho e reka hona joale, hona joale.
I mean think about it.	Ke bolela hore nahana ka eona.
No one wants to.	Ha ho motho ea batlang.
What they paid him.	Seo ba ileng ba mo lefa sona.
I enjoyed playing here.	Ke ne ke thabela ho bapala mona.
He often had other ideas.	Hangata o ne a e-na le maikutlo a mang.
I will try it soon.	Ke tla e leka haufinyane.
It is a dangerous place.	Ke sebaka se kotsi.
Maybe he'll let you use them.	Mohlomong o tla u lumella ho li sebelisa.
I will be second to him.	Ke tla ba oa bobeli ho eena.
I really don't know.	Ha ke hlile ha ke tsebe.
We can't get there quickly.	Ha re khone ho fihla moo kapele.
This is what he wanted his life to be like.	Sena ke seo a neng a batla hore bophelo ba hae bo be ka sona.
Come on in, you.	Kena ka mpa, uena.
However, he had to suffer, there was no other way.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a tlameha ho utloa bohloko, ho ne ho se mokhoa o mong.
These people do not do that.	Batho bana ha ba etse joalo.
Think about your job.	Nahana ka mosebetsi oa hau.
As hard as it is to believe sometimes.	Joalo ka ha ho le thata hore ke lumele ka linako tse ling.
These can help you save a lot of money.	Tsena li ka u thusa ho boloka chelete e ngata haholo.
Most people do not.	Batho ba bangata ha ba etse joalo.
I love my life just as it is.	Ke rata bophelo ba ka hantle kamoo bo leng kateng.
She looked beautiful.	O ne a bonahala a le motle.
To do it just because.	Ho e etsa hobane feela.
Some were happy to see him try.	Ba bang ba ne ba thabela ho mo bona a leka.
I'm not sure that's what you need.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore ke seo o se hlokang.
But he did not want to talk to anyone.	Empa o ne a sa batle ho bua le mang kapa mang.
He stayed with us for a long time talking.	O ile a lula le rōna nako e telele a ntse a bua.
But he did not do such a thing.	Empa o ne a sa etsa ntho e joalo.
We learn, but we are always too late.	Rea ithuta, empa kamehla re se re le morao haholo.
He corrected the mistake.	O ile a lokisa phoso.
He obviously enjoyed this.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a thabela sena.
For too long.	Ka nako e telele haholo.
It doesn't have to stay and stay.	Ha e a tlameha ho dula le ho dula.
So they bought some.	Kahoo ba reka tse ling.
I wondered what else they wanted.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na ba batla eng hape.
Everyone thought they knew it.	Bohle ba ne ba nahana hore baa o tseba.
You know what it would be like.	Ua tseba hore na ho ne ho tla ba joang.
Status.	Boemo.
I looked back.	Ke ile ka sheba ka morao.
He left.	A tloha .
But there are other problems.	Empa ho na le mathata a mang.
No really means no.	Che e hlile e bolela che.
Not at all, of course.	Ho hang, ka 'nete.
But perhaps, he should move on.	Empa mohlomong, o lokela ho tsoela pele.
But things were much better.	Empa lintho li ne li le ntle haholo.
The good news is that we can still have children.	Ntho e ntle ke hore re ntse re ka ba le bana.
This is what he was waiting to hear.	Sena ke seo a neng a emetse ho se utloa.
This is important and will not take much of your time.	Sena se bohlokoa 'me se ke ke sa nka nako ea hau e ngata.
Now this seemed to be the case.	Joale ho ne ho bonahala eka sena ke sona.
Do your homework.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau.
He has something.	O na le ho hong.
Because they are not.	Hobane ha ba joalo.
It is the worst.	Ke eona e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
Because this is important.	Hobane sena se bohlokoa.
He wanted to know what this meant.	O ne a batla ho tseba hore na sena se bolela eng.
You may have heard of him.	E ka ’na eaba u utloile ka eena.
I felt I knew nothing about him.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke sa tsebe letho ka eena.
It's too late now.	Ke morao haholo jwale.
They will not have to work.	Ba ke ke ba tlameha ho sebetsa.
For some reason this made me want to cry more.	Ka lebaka le itseng sena se ile sa etsa hore ke batle ho lla haholoanyane.
How did that work?	Seo se ile sa sebetsa joang?
It could not be.	E ne e ka se be jwalo.
He tried to correct the mistake.	O ile a leka ho lokisa phoso eo.
But do not expect me to do so.	Empa u se ke ua lebella hore ke tla etsa joalo.
Maybe you see the past.	Mohlomong u bona se fetileng.
He was so good.	O ne a le molemo hakaalo.
Maybe you know others.	Mohlomong u tseba ba bang.
In fact I like to think that is not the case.	Ha e le hantle ke rata ho nahana hore ha ho joalo.
He loves his children.	O rata bana ba hae.
We want to do it right.	Re batla ho e etsa hantle.
He seemed to know exactly what to do.	O ne a bonahala a tseba hantle seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
Getting started is hard.	Ho qala ho thata.
He knew in advance.	O ne a tseba esale pele.
Thank you, thank you.	Kea leboha, kea leboha.
This does not matter here.	Sena ha se taba mona.
I want him to leave.	Ke batla hore a tsamaee.
It has never been easier.	Ha ea ka ea e-ba bonolo ho feta moo.
I did not have any money.	Ha kea ka ka ba le chelete.
The children were happy.	Bana ba ne ba thabile.
Of course, they are yours.	Ehlile, ke ba hao.
He does it well.	O e etsa hantle.
Anyway, I have to go.	Leha ho le joalo, ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
I just have the power.	Ke na le matla feela.
The same thing could happen to the whole group.	Ho ka etsahala se tšoanang ka sehlopha sohle.
Please drive carefully.	Ka kopo, khanna ka hloko.
That's a lot!	Ke tse ngata!
I think it is very dangerous.	Ke nahana hore ho kotsi haholo.
Traveling was fun.	Ho tsamaea ho ne ho le monate.
You can find the start time in your area here.	U ka fumana nako ea ho qala sebakeng sa hau mona.
And maybe.	'Me mohlomong.
It is best to do this before the baby leaves.	Ho molemo ho etsa joalo pele ngoana a tsamaea.
The same is true for you.	Ho joalo le ka uena.
I don't think he ever did that.	Ha ke nahane hore o kile a etsa joalo.
I think it should work.	Ke nahana hore e lokela ho sebetsa.
He loved the book.	O ne a rata buka eo.
Still, it is fun to watch them.	Leha ho le joalo, ho monate ho li shebella.
He knew that a mother would want to have her own children.	O ne a tseba hore 'mè o tla batla ho ba le bana ba hae.
That time may not come or may never happen again.	Nako eo e ka 'na ea se ke ea fihla kapa ea se ke ea hlola e fihla.
Truth and style.	'Nete le mokhoa.
I like to see what other people have to say about it.	Ke rata ho bona seo batho ba bang ba se buang ka eona.
This is a great place to be.	Sena ke sebaka se setle ho ba ho sona.
He did not sleep.	Ha aa ka a robala.
Finally, finally.	Qetellong, qetellong.
And if you know us, you know that.	Mme ha o re tseba, o tseba seo.
I think they can.	Ke nahana hore ba ka khona.
Finally, it happens.	Qetellong, hoa etsahala.
I would not have had their work done for nothing.	Ke ne nke ke ka ba le mosebetsi oa bona bakeng sa letho.
Yes, you saw it right, it's bad.	Ee, u e bone hantle, e mpe.
I have to know.	Ke tlameha ho tseba.
We can only imagine.	Re ka nahana feela.
Well, that's exactly right now.	Be, ho hlile ho joalo joale.
The name was not mine.	Lebitso e ne e se la ka.
I think people should try it.	Ke nahana hore batho ba lokela ho e leka.
I don't have time to look at it today.	Ha ke na nako ea ho e sheba kajeno.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
For days I could not write.	E se e le matsatsi ke sa khone ho ngola.
We've been here longer than we should have been.	Re bile mona nako e telele ho feta kamoo re neng re lokela ho ba kateng.
He had children.	O ne a e-na le bana.
We saw them very close.	Re ba bone ba le haufi haholo.
They must love it.	Ba tlameha ho e rata.
It did not return.	Ha ea ka ea khutla.
But he also plays.	Empa le eena oa bapala.
I'll be back.	Ke tla khutla .
They will be here.	Ba tla ba teng mona.
I had to go to work tomorrow.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho ea mosebetsing hosane.
I thought the past was just fine.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e fetileng e hantle feela.
The boy started to cry.	Moshanyana eo o ile a qala ho lla.
This will be very helpful.	Sena se tla thusa haholo.
The man enters.	Monna oa kena.
His job was too hard for him to do alone.	Mosebetsi oa hae o ne o le boima haholo hore a ka o etsa a le mong.
I started looking and found it.	Ke ile ka qala ho sheba 'me ka fumana e le teng.
He did not know what to think of it.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a nahane eng ka eona.
It's hard to make money.	Ho thata ho etsa chelete.
It is even more dangerous.	Ke kotsi ho feta.
This trend continues.	Mokhoa ona o ntse o tsoela pele.
He didn't care.	O ne a sa tsotelle letho.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
But this is something new.	Empa sena ke ntho e ncha.
You have to tell me what's wrong.	O tlameha ho mpolella hore na phoso ke efe.
And he did.	Mme o ile a etsa seo.
But then something happened to him.	Empa joale ho ile ha etsahala ntho e 'ngoe ho eena.
They are fine.	Ba hantle.
This is very effective.	Sena se sebetsa haholo.
Who made it? 	Ke mang ea e entseng?
then it was a question.	joale e ne e le potso.
I'm not sure how or why it happens.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahala joang kapa hobaneng ho etsahala.
He did not believe that that was true.	O ne a sa lumele hore seo ke ’nete.
Everyone had to find their way back home.	E mong le e mong o ne a lokela ho fumana tsela ea hae ea ho khutlela hae.
You are human, and you are not really human.	Ke motho, mme wena, ha e le hantle ha o motho.
This did not seem to matter much.	Sena se ne se bonahala se se na taba hakaalo.
Yes you are.	Ho joalo u.
He found her waiting outside.	A mo fumana a mo emetse ka ntle.
I thought about it, maybe more than once.	Ke ile ka nahana ka eona, mohlomong ho feta hang.
I am responsible for the accident.	Ke molato oa kotsi.
Not a day went by that he did not think of her.	Ha ho letsatsi le ileng la feta a sa nahane ka eena.
And you will make a lot of money for us.	'Me u tla re etsetsa chelete e ngata.
Then he knew he had done well.	Joale o ne a tseba hore o entse hantle.
There is no such school.	Ha ho na sekolo se joalo.
Easy to write for.	O bonolo ho ngola bakeng sa.
He understood this.	O ne a utloisisa sena.
Good work for maintenance and efficient operation.	Mosebetsi o motle bakeng sa ho boloka le ho sebetsa hantle.
Very nice, don't you think?	E ntle haholo, ha u nahane?
In fact, it is even more useless.	Ha e le hantle, ha e na thuso le ho feta.
She never believed she could look as good as she looks.	Ho ne ho se mohla a kileng a lumela hore a ka shebahala joalo ka ha a ntse a shebahala.
You do it every day.	U e etsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
We’re fixing it as we go.	Re ntse re e lokisa ha re ntse re tsamaea.
Because it happens so much.	Hobane e etsahala haholo.
There is no way to know for sure.	Ha ho mokhoa oa ho tseba hantle.
No one asked him a question.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo botsa potso.
She is good at what she does.	O hantle ho seo a se etsang.
Money is very strong.	Chelete e matla haholo.
And many people will come.	Mme batho ba bangata ba tla tla.
They call before they come.	Ba letsa pele ba tla.
His last.	Ea hae ea ho qetela.
I would not cry.	Ke ne nke ke ka lla.
In the end, that is my job.	Qetellong, oo ke mosebetsi oa ka.
Sometimes we stop.	Ka linako tse ling rea ema.
This is my life, this is my life.	Ke bophelo ba ka, bona ke bophelo ba ka.
People get this.	Batho ba fumana sena.
Sometimes you have to go back.	Ka linako tse ling u tlameha ho khutlela morao.
So who is yesterday's girl?	Joale ngoanana oa maobane ke mang?
As you like.	Kamoo o ratang.
Money like this may pass.	Chelete e kang ena e ka 'na ea feta.
We have become real friends this year.	Re bile metsoalle ea sebele selemong sena.
It's too fast.	Khale kapele haholo.
It will be the best decision you ever made.	E tla ba qeto e molemo ka ho fetisisa eo o kileng oa e etsa.
There seems to be no problem with this.	Ho bonahala eka ha ho na bothata ka sena.
Then he read the headline.	Eaba o bala hlooho.
First, we must talk.	Pele, re lokela ho bua.
I knew it meant something to your wife.	Ke ne ke tseba hore e bolela ho hong ho mosali oa hau.
That is where we are.	Ke hona moo re leng teng.
There was no way they were just leaving here.	Ho ne ho se kamoo ba neng ba tloha mona feela.
That's where the money is, he thought.	Ke hona moo chelete e leng teng, a nahana joalo.
I hope to hear from you soon.	Ke tšepa ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena haufinyane.
Trying to do and be all for your team.	Ho leka ho etsa le ho ba tsohle bakeng sa sehlopha sa hau.
We don't see them.	Ha re ba bone.
I'm not alive.	Ha kea phela.
It seemed pointless to ask anything.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na thuso ea ho botsa letho.
He certainly would not have lasted long.	Ka sebele o ne a ke ke a nka nako e telele.
He is very big.	O moholo haholo.
Others stayed for a while.	Ba bang ba ile ba lula nako e 'ngoe.
But the problem is that you do not do it.	Empa bothata ke hore ha o e etse.
I do it.	Kea e etsa.
I don't even want to do it.	Ha ke batle le ho e etsa.
Look before you eat, something like that.	Sheba pele u ja, ntho ea mofuta oo.
He slammed the door and walked out.	O ile a bula lemati ha bonolo eaba oa tsoa.
He doesn't talk much about it.	Ha a bue hakaalo ka eona.
I start in the morning and work late.	Ke qala hoseng 'me ke sebetsa ka mor'a nako.
I know it.	Kea e tseba.
You don’t think about what’s important.	Ha u nahane ka seo e leng sa bohlokoa.
Everyone knew everything.	E mong le e mong o ne a tseba tsohle.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
First, he said.	Ea pele, o ile a re.
It should never have been good.	Ha ho mohla e neng e lokela ho ba molemo.
I hope he refuses.	Ke tšepa hore o hana.
But we do not want problems.	Empa ha re batle mathata.
And so they must.	Mme ka hona ba tlameha.
Anyone can enter.	Mang kapa mang a ka kena.
It can happen in the morning or very late at night.	E ka etsahala hoseng kapa bosiu haholo.
This is not the time.	Ha se nako eo.
But he usually does not say anything.	Empa hangata ha a bue letho.
He knew he was bigger than that.	O ne a tseba hore o moholo ho feta moo.
Go ahead, we all love you.	Tsoela pele, kaofela rea ​​u rata.
It was not so important.	E ne e se ea bohlokoa hakaalo.
See if you see anything.	Bona hore na u bona eng kapa eng.
I could not thank him.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho leboha.
Because that's what you do.	Hobane ke seo o se etsang.
However, he felt his strength.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a utloa matla a hae.
There are many of us.	Ho na le ba bangata ba rona.
This was good for me.	Sena se ne se le hantle ho nna.
He knows what happened.	O tseba se etsahetseng.
We really were there.	Ruri re ne re le teng.
He read about that.	O ne a bala ka tseo.
One would not be healthy without the other.	E mong o ne a ke ke a phela hantle ntle le e mong.
You may have been hurt.	Mohlomong u utloile bohloko.
They arrived tired, but happy.	Ba ile ba fihla ba khathetse, empa ba thabile.
They may have their own ideas about you.	E ka 'na eaba ba na le maikutlo a bona ka uena.
I could not find my way out of it.	Ha kea ka ka fumana tsela ea ka ea ho tsoa ho eona.
I just hear.	Ke utloa feela .
A lot actually.	E ngata ha e le hantle.
They both knew exactly what it meant.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba tseba hantle hore na e bolela eng.
Why do we always do the same things?	Ke hobane’ng ha re lula re etsa lintho tse tšoanang?
Everyone is happy.	E mong le e mong o thabile.
That is not what we have today.	Ha se seo re nang le sona kajeno.
I was unable to have her baby.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ba le ngoana oa hae.
A week or so later, the day arrived.	Ka mor'a beke kapa ho feta letsatsi le ile la fihla.
They took care of my baby.	Ba ne ba hlokomela ngoana oa ka.
Then he went out to see what had happened.	Eaba oa tsoa ho ea bona se etsahetseng.
Sorry it took so long to write.	Ke masoabi ho nkile nako e telele ho ngola.
No one is coming to talk to me.	Ha ho motho ea tlang ho tla bua le 'na.
I just want to come back to help.	Ke batla feela ho khutla ho tla thusa.
We hope this helps others.	Rea tšepa hore sena se thusa ba bang.
They are worse than before.	Ba mpe ho feta pele.
I will work very well, now.	Ke tla sebetsa hantle haholo, joale.
Do not leave without them.	U se ke ua tloha u se na tsona.
Get in and out quickly.	Ho kena le ho tsoa kapele.
Until he almost needed them.	Ho fihlela a batla a li hloka.
He did not want to do it again.	O ne a sa batle ho e etsa hape.
There is no point in trying to get back to sleep.	Ha ho na thuso ea ho leka ho khutlela ho robala.
He really did not know anything.	Ha e le hantle o ne a sa tsebe letho.
I love my parents.	Ke rata batsoali ba ka.
As anyone can understand that.	Joalo ka mang kapa mang a ka utloisisa seo.
He wants to win.	O batla ho hlola.
He read too much time during this time.	O ile a bala nako e ngata haholo nakong ena.
Although harder than before.	Leha ho le thata ho feta pele.
Do as you please.	Etsa kamoo o ratang kateng.
Nice to see you.	Ke thabela ho o bona.
We would find others like us.	Re ne re tla fumana ba bang ba kang rona.
The more money you have, the better your health.	Ha u e-na le chelete e ngata, u phela hantle haholoanyane.
This danger is dangerous.	Kotsi ena e kotsi.
It is not because one place is more important than the other.	Hase hobane sebaka se seng se le bohlokoa ho feta tse ling.
For this he would need a professional therapist.	Bakeng sa sena o ne a tla hloka setsebi sa setsebi.
I need you to know this.	Ke hloka hore o tsebe sena.
I have a long drive back home.	Ke na le koloi e telele ho khutlela hae.
But that's the kind of thing that happens.	Empa ke mofuta wa ntho e etsahalang.
Here is the second point.	Boemo ba bobeli ke bona.
However, the house.	Leha ho le joalo, ntlo.
I know you are busy.	Kea tseba hore u phathahane.
He wants them to be just that.	O batla hore ba be jwalo feela.
Then he said.	Eaba o re.
But it did.	Empa ho bile jwalo.
We will ask them.	Re tla ba botsa.
power.	matla.
I still do not fully understand.	Ke ntse ke sa utloisise hantle.
He thinks he will enjoy that.	O nahana hore o tla thabela seo.
There is no.	Ha ho na.
I just didn’t want to.	Ke ne ke sa batle feela.
Not them either.	Che bona le rona.
He knew that people needed him there.	O ne a tseba hore batho ba mo hloka moo.
However, we must watch him.	Leha ho le joalo, re tlameha ho mo shebella.
That is what we are.	Ke seo re leng sona.
But now who knows.	Empa joale ke mang ea tsebang.
We became very close.	Re ile ra ba haufi haholo.
But let me see.	Empa e re ke bone .
Now.	Joale .
What did you do yesterday after school?	Maobane u entse'ng ka mor'a sekolo?
Do what you have to do.	Etsa seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
There was no way of it.	Ho ne ho se na mokhoa oa eona.
He was a very strange man.	E ne e le motho ya makatsang ruri.
Glad to finally meet you.	Ke thabetse hore qetellong ke kopane le uena.
The son came home with his dog.	Mora o ile a tla hae le ntja ea hae.
What we did.	Seo re se entseng.
But he is not sure if he can do it.	Empa ha a na bonnete ba hore na a ka e etsa.
We believe he did not.	Re lumela hore ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
Note first that the problem already exists in the old fashioned way.	Hlokomela pele hore bothata bo se bo ntse bo le teng ka mokhoa oa khale.
I'd like to visit her.	Ke kopa ho mo etela.
It was just right.	E ne e lekana hantle.
This, he had never done before.	Sena, o ne a eso ka a se etsa pele.
In fact, he wants to be arrested.	Ha e le hantle, o batla ho tšoaroa.
I know where he can be.	Ke tseba moo a ka bang teng.
Many people find it difficult to work with others.	Batho ba bangata ba fumana ho le thata ho sebetsa le ba bang.
Yes, it is.	E, ke eona.
With your book.	Ka buka ea hau.
I will understand better if you can refuse.	Ke tla utloisisa hantle haeba u ka hana.
Nonsense name, we know.	Lebitso le hlokang kelello, rea tseba.
And we are fine.	Mme re hantle.
It is easy to find these.	Ho bonolo ho fumana tsena.
And to learn about yourself you have to be alone.	'Me ho ithuta ka uena u tlameha ho ba mong.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke tsebe hantle.
It was a great pleasure to meet you.	Ho bile monate haholo ho kopana le wena.
I'm just trying to do it right.	Ke mpa ke leka ho e etsa hantle.
He has no power, he thinks.	Ha a na matla, oa nahana.
I did not want to go.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho ea.
I have never been healthy.	Ha ke so ka ke phela hantle.
Maybe you should go to another one.	Mohlomong o lokela ho ea ho e 'ngoe.
They seemed to want it.	Ho ne ho bonahala ba e batla.
But he had nothing new.	Empa o ne a se na tse ncha.
That would not be so.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
Many people believe that they are better than their predecessors.	Batho ba bangata ba lumela hore ba molemo ho feta ba pele ho bona.
He called and told me.	O ile a letsa mme a mpolella.
I didn’t know if that was a good thing or not.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na eo ke ntho e ntle kapa che.
But you don't.	Empa ha u etse joalo.
Please write down your thoughts.	Ka kopo ngola maikutlo a hau.
It's this place.	Ke sebaka sena.
Check this out.	Sheba sena.
I had a hard time enough because of it.	Ke bile le nako e thata ho lekana ka lebaka la eona.
The man wins.	Monna o a hlola.
It should not be too hard.	Ha ea lokela ho ba thata haholo.
Think about what you want.	Nahana ka seo u se batlang.
I wanted to sit down.	Ke ne ke batla ho lula fatše.
They did not understand what they were doing wrong.	Ba ne ba sa utloisise hore na ba entse phoso efe.
Do not try to think or think.	O seke wa leka ho nahana kapa ho se nahane.
He doesn't, he doesn't have very long.	Ha a etse joalo, ha a na nako e telele haholo.
Some are very visible.	Tse ling li bonahala haholo.
They all go home.	Bohle ba ya hae.
For me, well, I did it just because I wanted to.	Ho 'na, hantle, ke e entse feela hobane ke ne ke batla.
He does that from time to time.	O etsa seo nako le nako.
It is not so difficult to understand.	Ha ho thata hakaalo ho utloisisa.
I will have many things to ask him.	Ke tla ba le lintho tse ngata tseo ke tla mo botsa tsona.
You wear whatever you like.	U apara eng kapa eng eo u e ratang.
We move from place to place.	Re tloha sebakeng se seng ho ea ho se seng ho ea pele.
No, it is not.	Che, ha se eona.
But let me tell you - it was the best thing that ever happened to me.	Empa e re ke u bolelle, ke eona e molemo ka ho fetisisa.
We will be very grateful.	Re tla leboha haholo.
I am a child.	Ke ngoana.
We are truly children of the day.	Ruri re bana ba letsatsi.
It's not right yet.	Ha ho eso be hantle.
We work as a team here.	Re sebetsa re le sehlopha mona.
That he tried again.	Hore o ile a leka hape.
I was glad to see it.	Ke ile ka thabela ho e bona.
I try to use the application but can't get there.	Ke leka ho sebelisa kopo empa ha ke khone ho fihla moo.
He knows a lot of people.	O tseba batho ba bangata.
Don't give them a chance.	U se ke ua ba fa monyetla.
He is coming here.	O tla mona.
I think that's wrong.	Ke nahana hore hoo ke phoso.
However, we are still working now.	Leha ho le joalo, re ntse re sebetsa hona joale.
Get them talking.	Etsa hore ba bue.
I will give him the work he will do this time.	Ke tla mo fa mosebetsi oo a tla o etsa nakong ena.
No one should buy this.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho reka sena.
People want their work to be important.	Batho ba batla hore mosebetsi oa bona e be oa bohlokoa.
It takes time.	Ho nka nako.
I will definitely agree.	Ke tla lumela hakaalo.
Your job is just long.	Mosebetsi oa hau o telele feela.
I use it when he is away.	Ke e sebelisa ha a le sieo.
And they will not go there as friends.	'Me ba ke ke ba ea moo e le metsoalle.
We work well together.	Re sebetsa hammoho hantle.
Well, one thing indeed.	Hantle, ntho e le 'ngoe ruri.
Everyone else does.	Batho bohle ba bang ba etsa joalo.
I had nothing to do with them.	Ke ne ke se na taba le bona.
That would not help the situation.	Seo se ne se ke ke sa thusa boemo.
And we are sorry.	'Me re masoabi.
However, it is worse than that.	Leha ho le joalo, e mpe ho feta moo.
I do not know why.	Ha ke tsebe na hobaneng.
She has a very bad headache.	O tšoeroe ke hlooho e bohloko haholo.
Your life needs you.	Bophelo ba hao bo u hloka.
This method is required.	Mokhoa ona oa hlokahala.
But the problem was still there.	Empa bothata bo ne bo ntse bo le teng.
He did not like that.	O ne a sa rate seo.
Maybe people enjoy this.	Mohlomong batho ba thabela sena.
However that is not enough.	Leha ho le joalo hoo ha hoa lekana.
Both were new to us.	Ka bobeli e ne e le ntho e ncha ho rona.
We went into his room.	Re ile ra kena ka kamoreng ea hae.
You do not see this.	Ha o bone sena.
We did not do that.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
But the book goes beyond that.	Empa buka e feta moo.
I love you more than you were when you were my child.	Ke u rata ho feta ha u ne u le ngoana oa ka.
But one had to do it.	Empa motho o ne a tlameha ho e etsa.
I don't think I can say anything.	Ha ke nahane letho leo nka le buang.
I love you more than ever.	Ke u rata joaloka pele le ho feta pele.
He took them.	A li nka.
We are doing well here.	Re ntse re sebetsa hantle mona.
They don't talk to me.	Ha ba bue le nna.
I used to wish this.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ho lakatsa sena.
At the end of the day, you want it.	Qetellong ea letsatsi, ua e batla.
That is, it would still be there.	Ke ho re, ho ne ho tla be ho ntse ho le teng.
Everyone wants money.	E mong le e mong o batla chelete.
My father cried.	Ntate a lla.
It will never happen again.	Ha e sa tla hlola e etsahala.
This is something new.	Ena ke ntho e ncha.
I loved that girl.	Ke ne ke rata ngoanana eo.
I didn't need to.	Ke ne ke sa hloke.
I told her to find out about the man.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore a tsebe ka monna eo.
I do not want to be arrested, but I am wrong.	Ha ke batle ho tšoaroa, empa ke phoso.
I could not do this.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho etsa sena.
That's the way he was.	Ke kamoo a neng a le kateng.
Take a chance.	Nka monyetla.
I am very sorry about this.	Ke masoabi haholo ka litaba tsena.
I did not work with him.	Ha kea sebetsa le eena.
Without looking at them, he spoke.	A sa ba sheba, a bua.
One of us had to leave.	E mong oa rōna o ile a tlameha ho tsamaea.
Here is what we are going to do.	Mona ke seo re tlang ho se etsa.
You can never talk about what happened here to anyone, ever.	U ke ke ua bua ka se etsahetseng mona ho mang kapa mang, le ka mohla.
She is a big girl.	Ke ngoanana e moholo.
You look so much better.	O shebahala o le betere haholo.
But it was then, and it is now.	Empa e ne e le ka nako eo, 'me ke hona joale.
Do not pay anything.	U se ke ua lefa letho.
He loved many people.	O ne a rata batho ba bangata.
He left the room.	A tsoa ka kamoreng eo.
So please, do what you can.	Kahoo ka kopo, etsa seo u ka se khonang.
I can go anywhere.	Nka ea kae kapa kae.
He seems to have that more than most.	Ho bonahala o na le seo ho feta ba bangata.
I could not go there.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ea moo.
It was gone.	E ne e ile.
Probably more than once.	Mohlomong ho feta hang.
Maybe you are eating grass.	Mohlomong u ntse u ja joang.
I'd love to hear from you about it!	Ke kopa ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena ka eona!
But he still loved her.	Empa o ne a ntse a mo rata.
Make sure you work hard every day.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u sebetsa ka thata letsatsi le leng le le leng.
I don't want to see it.	ha ke batle ho e bona.
There you go, see.	Ke moo, o ya bona.
Tell them what they want to hear.	Ba bolelle seo ba batlang ho se utloa.
But then it happened to me.	Empa joale ho ile ha etsahala ho ’na.
She felt very happy.	O ile a ikutloa a thabile haholo.
It would be better to forget everything.	Ho ka ba molemo ho lebala tsohle.
There is almost nothing we can do.	Ho batla ho se letho leo re ka le etsang.
I mean very well.	Ke bolela hantle haholo.
Perhaps this was not the question to ask him.	Mohlomong ena e ne e se potso ea ho mo botsa.
He played strangely.	O ile a bapala ka tsela e makatsang.
Instead of driving, the children would walk.	Ho e-na le ho khanna, bana ba ne ba tsamaea ka maoto.
None of them said anything.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea buileng letho.
I had seen what he could do last night.	Ke ne ke bone seo a ka se etsang maobane bosiu.
For whatever time they had.	Bakeng sa nako efe kapa efe eo ba neng ba e-na le eona.
And you can't do anything.	'Me u ke ke ua etsa letho.
So why is no one doing anything?	Joale, ke hobane'ng ha ho se motho ea etsang letho?
To be close to him would be a strange thing.	Ho ba haufi le eena e ne e tla ba ntho e makatsang haholo.
We need to know.	Re hloka ho tseba.
They would be together until the end.	Ba ne ba tla ba hammoho ho fihlela qetellong.
It’s even harder not to do it sometimes, though.	Ho ba thata le ho feta ho se etse joalo ka linako tse ling, leha ho le joalo.
Once you have it, they will demand money.	Ha u se u e-na le eona, ba tla batla chelete.
However, it may be fun to hear one first.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ka ba monate ho utloa e 'ngoe pele.
One place no one can imagine looking at.	Sebaka se le seng ha ho motho ea ka nahanang ho se sheba.
For people with such a problem.	Bakeng sa batho ba nang le bothata bo joalo.
They had taken everything from me.	Ba ne ba nkile tsohle ho nna.
From here it means eating breakfast.	Ho tloha mona ho bolela ho ja lijo tsa hoseng.
Of course, it was better to wait.	Ha e le hantle, ho ne ho le molemo ho ema.
She was incredibly beautiful.	O ne a le motle ka tsela e makatsang.
I was able to find a way back.	Ke ne ke khona ho fumana tsela ea ho khutla.
It seemed like a good idea, so we did it.	E ne eka ke mohopolo o motle, kahoo re ile ra o etsa.
The troubles went away and he had to be close to her.	Mathata a ile a tsamaea 'me a ba le ho ba haufi le eena.
You cannot do both.	U ke ke ua li etsa ka bobeli.
Do not speak in my name.	U se ke ua bua le lebitso la ka.
They worked with them.	Ba ne ba sebetsa le bona.
That was fun.	Ntho eo e ne e le monate.
You will never find the family you want.	Ha ho mohla u tla fumana lelapa leo u le batlang.
Of course sometimes it is not that he does not know.	Ehlile ka linako tse ling ha se hore ha a tsebe.
The picture is real.	Setšoantšo ke 'nete.
Now, he opens it.	Jwale, o e bula.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
In fact, he loved children even more than he loved them.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a rata bana ho feta kamoo a neng a ba rata kateng.
Long back.	Nako e telele morao.
Yours I love so much.	Hao ke rata haholo.
It's happening.	Ho ntse ho etsahala.
Then if there is no one, start one.	Joale haeba ho se na e le 'ngoe, qala e le 'ngoe.
No one knows us.	Ha ho motho ea re tsebang.
That is easy to understand.	Seo se bonolo ho se utloisisa.
I'm so glad you like it.	Ke thabile haholo hore ebe oa e rata.
All of these things worked out very well.	Lintho tsena kaofela li ile tsa sebetsa ka tsela e molemo haholo.
Probably three times.	Mohlomong ka makhetlo a mararo.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
Now we go on, or not.	Jwale re ya pele, kapa ho seng jwalo.
One day, it could be you.	Ka letsatsi le leng, e ka ba uena.
Who seemed very happy a few days earlier.	Ea neng a bonahala a thabile haholo matsatsi a 'maloa pele ho moo.
Well, they worked through me, and it did.	Be, ba ile ba sebetsa ka nna, mme ho bile jwalo.
Like us.	Joalo ka rona.
We are better than they.	Re betere ho feta bona.
But he did not want to.	Empa o ne a sa batle.
Look what he did.	Sheba seo a se entseng.
Get to know your family too.	Tseba lelapa la hao hape.
We know it's something else.	Rea tseba hore ke ntho e 'ngoe hape.
You will find it tomorrow.	U tla e fumana hosane.
It was as it was.	E ne e le kamoo e neng e le kateng.
But we will talk.	Empa re tla bua.
They would not be there to help us.	Ba ne ba sa tl’o ba teng ho tla re thusa.
I do nothing.	Ha ke etse letho.
Drink water first.	Noa metsi pele.
And maybe even more.	'Me mohlomong le ho feta.
He was just so tired.	O ne a khathetse haholo feela.
This makes our problem even more difficult.	Sena se etsa hore bothata ba rona bo be boima le ho feta.
I think it's a lot of fun.	Ke nahana hore ho monate haholo.
People are already aware of this.	Batho ba se ba ntse ba hlokomela sena.
Those in your group.	Ba leng sehlopheng sa hau.
We are working harder through this very difficult time.	Re sebetsa ka thata ho feta nakong ena e thata haholo.
Everyone makes each other the way they are.	E mong le e mong o etsa hore e mong a be kamoo a leng kateng.
Then he went ahead.	Eaba o ea pele.
I had never seen this car before.	Ke ne ke qala ho bona koloi ena.
How tall you are.	Hore na o telele.
We will certainly do that.	Ka sebele re tla etsa joalo.
I no longer drink too much.	Ha ke sa noa haholo hakaalo.
It's the only real one here.	Ke eona feela ea sebele mona.
Obviously, they will never do that again.	Ho hlakile hore ha ba sa tla hlola ba etsa joalo.
Maybe you want to sit down.	Mohlomong u batla ho lula fatše.
It would not be good for any of them.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba molemo ho e mong oa bona.
I no longer have its place or anything.	Ha ke sa na sebaka sa eona kapa eng kapa eng.
They did not talk about that.	Ha ba ka ba bua ka seo.
However, there was no such thing.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se letho le joalo.
We do not know how to help them.	Ha re tsebe ho ba thusa joang.
I must, too.	Ke tlameha, le nna.
The reason for this is obvious.	Lebaka la sena le hlakile.
Then they drove away.	Eaba ba tsamaea ka koloi.
This book is not new.	Buka ena ha e ncha.
Best practice.	Mokhoa o motle ka ho fetisisa.
They would soon know.	Ba ne ba tla tloha ba tseba.
He never suggested anything.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a fana ka maikutlo a letho.
Never make a decision.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua etsa qeto.
He would never come back.	O ne a ke ke a hlola a khutla.
I did not understand that well.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise seo hantle.
That is exactly what happened.	Ke sona se etsahetseng hantle.
Read this book, and you will be arrested again.	Bala buka ena, 'me u tla tšoaroa hape.
The team had to work fast.	Sehlopha se ne se lokela ho sebetsa kapele.
And it would have been even worse.	'Me e ka be e bile mpe le ho feta.
These are our favorite shoes.	Tsena ke lieta tseo re li ratang ka ho fetisisa.
We all had a wonderful time.	Kaofela re bile le nako e monate haholo.
I left quickly.	Ke ile ka tloha kapele.
However, in the end nothing is enough.	Leha ho le joalo, qetellong ha ho letho le lekaneng.
The present tense.	Nako ea joale.
There was no way he could meet anyone he knew.	Ho ne ho se kamoo a neng a ka kopana le mang kapa mang eo a mo tsebang.
Stay in it.	Lula ho eona.
He was a man.	E ne e le monna.
They did not think it was possible.	Ba ne ba sa nahane hore ho ka etsahala.
Everything was weightless.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e se na boima.
However, they sometimes played with me.	Leha ho le joalo, ka linako tse ling ba ne ba bapala le 'na.
It will make you believe you have a good idea.	O tla etsa hore o lumele hore o na le mohopolo o motle.
He didn't look at it hard.	O ne a sa e sheba ka thata.
I always enjoy when you pass.	Ke thabela kamehla ha o feta.
Calling times.	Ho letsetsa linako.
So one woman got a job.	Kahoo, mosali e mong oa mosali o ile a fumana mosebetsi.
That would be fun, you know.	Hoo ho ka ba monate, ua tseba.
It worked well.	E ne e sebetsa hantle.
Of course he could.	Ehlile o ne a ka khona.
See here, and here, and here.	Bona mona, le mona, le mona.
He's in a place where he can do that.	O sebakeng seo a ka etsang seo.
This problem is very important to me.	Bothata bona bo bohlokoa haholo ho nna.
I could not know it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e tseba.
I would have to fix that.	Nka tlameha ho lokisa seo.
He was very happy.	O ne a thabile haholo.
We love how beautiful it is, too.	Re rata kamoo e leng ntle kateng, le rona.
But we know what really happened.	Empa re tseba se neng se hlile se etsahala.
There was another one.	Ho ne ho e-na le e 'ngoe hape.
This was not his case.	Ena e ne e se taba ea hae.
Kick ass.	E monate haholo.
He didn't want to, he thought.	O ne a sa batle, o ne a nahana jwalo.
They ate dinner before dinner.	Ba ne ba ja lijo tsa mantsiboea pele ho mantsiboea.
I really like it this way.	Ke hlile ke rata ka tsela ena.
Except he didn't and he can't do it now.	Ntle le hore ha a ka a etsa mme a ke ke a khona hona joale.
In time, you will have a better job.	Ha nako e ntse e ea, u tla ba le mosebetsi o betere.
I see that.	Ke bona hoo.
It will not hold.	E ke ke ea tšoara.
But you have to find the right time.	Empa u tlameha ho fumana nako hantle.
They did not have to search long.	Ha baa ka ba tlameha ho batla nako e telele.
I was very close to my father.	Ke ne ke le haufi haholo le Ntate.
Many people in this area are visually impaired.	Batho ba bangata sebakeng sena ha ba bone hantle.
Use time well, you do one thing at a time.	Sebelisa nako hantle, u etsa ntho e le 'ngoe ka nako.
I can '.	nka khona'.
However, he did not do this.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha aa ka a se etsa.
What it is, and what it means.	Ke eng, le hore na e bolela eng.
It was nice to be with him here.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba le eena mona.
Finally the sun came out.	Qetellong letsatsi le ile la tsoa.
I did this.	Ke entse sena.
And he knew that this made them want him more.	Mme o ne a tseba hore sena se etsa hore ba mo batle ho feta.
One year we had a very handsome young man.	Selemong se seng re ile ra ba le mohlankana ea neng a le motle haholo.
And you don't.	Mme ha o etse jwalo.
He loved his father very much.	O ne a rata ntate oa hae haholo.
I do not understand this.	Ha ke utloisise sena.
I thought so.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho joalo.
He would never find it again.	O ne a ke ke a hlola a e fumana.
I love it, very much.	Kea e rata, haholo.
So you have another chance.	Kahoo u na le monyetla o mong.
It was very difficult to stand up.	Ho ne ho le boima haholo ho ema.
So that can happen with food.	Kahoo seo se ka etsahala ka lijo.
You look beautiful.	O shebahala o le motle.
I will be the best woman ever.	Ke tla ba mosali ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
You have to do this.	O lokela ho etsa sena.
Or many of them.	Kapa tse ngata tsa tsona.
I had no time to think about anything.	Ke ne ke se na nako ea ho nahana ka letho.
what is strange ???.	ke ntho efe e makatsang ???.
It is usually the first investment.	Hangata ke chelete ea pele.
Your people, but you see them.	Batho ba hao, empa le ba bona.
But don't say anything.	Empa o seke wa bua letho.
He wanted to get out.	O ne a batla ho tsoa.
This was a very new thing.	Ena e ne e le ntho e ncha haholo.
How did we do it?	Re entse joang?
I will never forget his name.	Nke ke ka lebala lebitso la hae.
He did not know what it meant.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na e bolela eng.
To cry well is to live and love well too.	Ho lla hantle ke ho phela le ho rata hantle hape.
Just to.	Feela ho.
He did not sleep for hours.	Ha aa ka a robala lihora tse ngata.
I do not like the law.	ha ke rate molao.
Learning is a lifelong endeavor.	Ho ithuta ke mosebetsi oa bophelo bohle.
See, it's better.	Le a bona, e molemo ho feta.
Ride fast, boy.	Palama kapele, moshanyana.
I thought they were very good.	Ke ne ke nahana hore li ntle haholo.
They make money once in a while.	Ba etsa chelete hang ka nako.
It is living alone.	Ke ho phela o le mong.
I often have that problem, too.	Hangata ke na le bothata boo, le 'na.
I am fixing problems.	Ke ntse ke lokisa mathata.
He ate nothing.	O ne a sa ja letho.
What we did.	Seo re se entseng.
I just thought of all that.	Ke ile ka nahana seo sohle feela.
Just leave.	Tloha feela .
I will be a girl.	Ke tla be ke le ngoanana.
I have things to do.	Ke na le lintho tseo ke lokelang ho li etsa.
She is doing well now.	O ntse a sebetsa hantle hona jwale.
He loved it all, because it was his.	O ne a e rata kaofela, hobane e ne e le ea hae.
That is the place he is coming to.	Ke sebaka seo a tlang ho sona.
Room, which he had never entered.	Kamore, eo a neng a e-so ka a kena ho eona.
It's hard to try.	Ho thata ho leka.
We must do bad things.	Re tlameha ho etsa lintho tse mpe.
Well, you know.	Be, ua tseba.
That is the important thing.	Ke eona ntho ea bohlokoa.
People were just starting to get in.	Batho ba ne ba qala ho kena.
Some may have done so.	E ka ’na eaba ba bang ba entse joalo.
They will understand.	Ba tla utloisisa.
That is why this is so important.	Ke kahoo sena se leng bohlokoa hakana.
Police worked all night.	Mapolesa a ile a sebetsa bosiu bohle.
It meant power.	Ho ne ho bolela matla.
He used his name, and paid with money.	O ne a sebelisa lebitso la hae, ’me a lefa ka chelete.
You are not sure how that helps.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na seo se thusa joang.
One day we may find what we are looking for.	Ka letsatsi le leng re ka fumana seo re se batlang.
Maybe this is a little important.	Mohlomong sena se bohlokoa hanyane.
I'm almost alone.	Ke batla ke le mong.
I wanted to go.	Ke ne ke batla ho tsamaea.
What will you do in the future?	U tla etsa’ng nakong e tlang?
I think we need both.	Ke nahana hore re li hloka ka bobeli.
He thought he might need help.	O ne a nahana hore mohlomong o lokela ho fumana thuso.
Do not drink and drive.	U se ke ua noa 'me ua khanna.
We have all been children before.	Kaofela re kile ra ba bana.
But their power took time.	Empa matla a bona a ile a nka nako.
But this did not happen.	Empa sena ha sea ka sa etsahala.
I really didn't know how to take it.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa tsebe ho e nka.
And he does.	Mme o etsa jwalo.
Maybe now more than ever.	Mohlomong hona joale ho feta pele.
He wanted to come.	O ne a batla ho tla.
And nothing.	'Me ha ho letho le.
And it didn't just cry, it cried like an old phone.	'Me ha ea ka ea lla feela, e lla joalo ka mohala oa khale.
You have one.	U na le e 'ngoe.
I ask it.	kea e botsa.
I will say that.	Ke tla bolela seo.
I decided to try this.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho leka sena.
Is it visible, or invisible?	Na ea bonahala, kapa ha e bonahale?
Well, it didn't matter.	Be, ho ne ho se taba.
This place really.	Sebaka sena ka sebele.
He doesn't have to look at it.	Ha a lokela ho o sheba.
No, it is not someone else.	Che, ha se motho e mong.
I am even happier to fix things.	Ke thabile le ho feta ho lokisa lintho.
Can you believe her husband really allowed her ?.	Na u ka lumela hore monna oa hae o hlile oa mo lumella?.
We still do not.	Re ntse re sa etse joalo.
I like it here.	Ke e rata mona.
Maybe it could be more or less.	Mohlomong e ka ba ho feta kapa hanyane hanyane.
He had nothing.	O ne a se na letho.
I was very happy.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo.
I wanted to have children.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba le bana.
And more.	Le ho feta.
Why do you really love someone	Ke hobane'ng ha u hlile u rata motho
The dog was very important.	Ntja e ne e le ea bohlokoa haholo.
You can still stay at my house.	U ntse u ka lula ha ka.
We know we can't stay now.	Rea tseba hore re ke ke ra lula hona joale.
And we would not know where we are.	'Me re ne re tla be re sa tsebe moo re leng teng.
Maybe he took it very seriously.	Mohlomong o ne a e nka hantle haholo.
They will want to know why, and they will ask you.	Ba tla batla ho tseba lebaka, 'me ba tla u botsa.
Perhaps you too would like that.	Mohlomong le uena u ne u tla thabela seo.
I had no idea if they were working.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na li ntse li sebetsa.
Love what you are.	Rata seo u leng sona.
I like people like that.	Ke rata batho ba joalo.
Or maybe a lot of people.	Kapa mohlomong batho ba bangata.
I told her exactly what happened.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hantle se etsahetseng.
I was a boy.	Ke ne ke le moshanyana.
You know how this feels now.	Ua tseba hore na sena se ikutloa joang hona joale.
He eats with it.	O ja le eona.
Often they have not.	Hangata ha ba eso.
I was strong.	Ke ne ke na le matla.
Drink from it.	Ho noa ho tsoa ho eona.
No one had ever seen or heard anything.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a bona kapa a utloa letho.
I never did it again.	Ha kea e etsa hape.
I had to see him.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho mo bona.
She is beautiful.	O motle.
I want to look at her well, hard.	Ke batla ho mo sheba hantle, ka thata.
We both have it.	Ka bobeli re na le eona.
I know what the truth looks like.	Kea tseba hore na 'nete e shebahala joang.
There was no point in walking, he realized.	Ho ne ho se ho se na thuso ea ho tsamaea, o ile a hlokomela.
That is the way life is.	Ke kamoo bophelo bo leng kateng.
He certainly did not speak.	Ka sebele ha a ka a bua.
He lives it.	O a e phela.
I do not know if it is true.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke 'nete.
And it is very good.	'Me e ntle haholo.
This he did not hear.	Sena ha aa ka a se utloa.
You buy delicious food.	U reka lijo tse monate.
And they were still my friends.	'Me e ne e ntse e le metsoalle ea ka.
I would get into it.	Ke ne ke tla kena ho eona.
I thought, this is the longest.	Ke ile ka nahana, ena ke eona e telele.
It will not be good for anyone tomorrow.	Ha ho sa tla ba molemo ho motho hosane.
I will be in it.	Ke tla ba ho eona.
When you have that, you have a lot.	Ha u na le seo, u na le tse ngata.
I'm glad you had fun.	Ke thabetse hore ebe u bile monate.
We would get it.	Re ne re tla o fumana.
Getting a job.	Ho fumana mosebetsi.
So, that would mean everyone.	Kahoo, seo se ne se tla bolela bohle.
He had met her before.	O kile a kopana le eena pele.
They are important to them.	Ba bohlokoa ho bona.
Whatever he wanted to say, he didn't want to say too much.	Eng kapa eng eo a neng a batla ho e bua, o ne a sa batle ho e bua haholo.
And when.	Mme neng.
For her.	Bakeng sa hae.
What the people there are.	Seo batho ba moo ba leng sona.
We love her so much.	Re mo rata haholo.
The door slammed shut.	Lemati la lla haholo.
He can't.	A ke ke a khona.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
So, yes, we say things.	Kahoo, e, re bua lintho.
Start from today.	Qala ho tloha kajeno.
Life happens very fast.	Bophelo bo etsahala kapele haholo.
He lived three hours from there.	O ne a lula lihora tse tharo ho tloha moo.
She needed something, she needed a son.	E ne e hloka ho hong, e hloka mora.
That's not what he is.	Ha se seo a leng sona.
Do not do the same.	Le uena u se ke ua etsa joalo.
Eventually, he found a job.	Qetellong, o ile a fumana mosebetsi.
I looked down at it.	Ke ile ka e sheba fatše.
Where do they live?	Ba lula kae?
But you see.	Empa oa bona.
But they were there.	Empa ba ne ba le teng.
It was thinking about it.	E ne e nahana ka eona.
He didn't care too much.	O ne a sa tsotelle haholo.
This is not a problem at all.	Sena ha se bothata ho hang.
You probably have the best life possible right now.	Mohlomong o na le bophelo bo monate ka ho fetisisa hona joale.
They can help you.	Ba ka u thusa.
They seemed to be going very well.	Ho ne ho bonahala ba ntse ba tsamaea hantle haholo.
I was right about that.	Ke ne ke le hantle ho seo.
The situation at the time did not matter.	Boemo ka nako eo bo ne bo se na taba.
I'll see what happens.	Ke tla bona se etsahalang.
But here is my point.	Empa taba ea ka ke ena.
None of us wanted them.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a li batla.
Of course we are not.	Ehlile ha re joalo.
I saw it in my work.	Ke e bone mosebetsing oa ka.
They said they were present when they opened.	Ba itse ba be teng ha ba bula.
They do not see well at night.	Ha ba bone hantle bosiu.
Maybe he was still there.	Mohlomong o ne a ntse a le teng.
By way of word.	Ka tsela ya ho bua.
You can talk about it.	U ka bua ka eona.
He often thought about them.	Hangata o ne a nahana ka tsona.
Maybe they thought they could live with it.	Mohlomong ba ne ba nahana hore ba ka phela le eona.
He stood up, looking around the room.	A ema, a sheba kamore.
It would have been much better if we had spent many years together.	Ho ka be ho bile molemo haholo hoja re ka qeta lilemo tse ngata re le hammoho.
He loves to be there.	O rata ho ba teng.
Look closely at you.	Sheba haufi le uena.
You have to catch that moment.	U tlameha ho tšoara nako eo.
She wondered about her son.	A ipotsa ka mora wa hae.
We see the power of humans.	Re bona matla a batho.
My mother did not tell me anything.	'Mè ha aa ka a mpolella letho.
Saving something to you.	Ho boloka ho hong ho uena.
They never lived together.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba lula hammoho.
They did nothing.	Ha ho letho leo ba le entseng.
There will no longer be enough money for them.	Ho ke ke ha hlola ho ba le chelete e lekaneng bakeng sa bona.
I do not know what he is talking about.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o bua ka eng.
Instead of just standing there.	Ho e-na le ho ema feela.
But still everything is clear.	Empa leha ho le joalo e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e hlakile.
He did not need to speak.	O ne a sa hloke ho bua.
And there is nothing wrong with that.	'Me ha ho letho le phoso ka seo.
I'll tell you later.	Ke tla u bolella ka letsatsi le leng.
Nobody likes him.	Ha ho motho ea mo ratang.
It was very dangerous, he knew.	Ho ne ho le kotsi haholo, o ne a tseba.
I know nothing about your life.	Ha ke tsebe letho ka bophelo ba hao.
Now, it's time for me to speak well all night.	Jwale, ke nako ya hore ke bue hantle bosiu bohle.
You were not a child.	U ne u se ngoana.
Or where we do it.	Kapa moo re e etsang.
They got it all.	Ba fumane bohle.
But there was a mistake.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le phoso.
There are many.	Ho na le tse ngata.
We cannot continue living in the past.	Re ke ke ra tsoela pele ho phela nakong e fetileng.
How to use the three learning skills.	Mokhoa oa ho sebelisa matla a ho ithuta a mararo.
I hope you will take my case seriously.	Ke tšepa hore u tla nka taba ea ka hantle.
This did not happen.	Sena ha sea ka sa etsahala.
Their lives were in constant danger.	Bophelo ba bona bo ne bo lula bo le kotsing.
I'm glad to read that.	Ke thabetse ho bala seo.
It's my Life.	Ke bophelo ba ka.
People began to wonder about his life.	Batho ba ile ba qala ho ipotsa ka bophelo ba hae.
This, and nothing more.	Sena, 'me ha ho letho le ho feta.
You have to read everything.	U lokela ho bala lintho tsohle.
I was tired too.	Le ’na ke ne ke khathetse.
We will do just that.	Re tla etsa joalo hantle.
A long time ago.	Khale khale .
And you didn't seem to have much time for people who didn't have it.	'Me ho ne ho bonahala u se na nako e ngata bakeng sa batho ba se nang eona.
Think, woman, think.	Nahana, mosali, nahana.
You know, he played well when he had to.	Ua tseba, o ne a bapala hantle ha a tlameha.
No one wants to see their favorite band reunite.	Ha ho motho ea ratang ho bona sehlopha seo a se ratang se kopana hape.
I thought he could play.	Ke ne ke nahana hore a ka bapala.
But that is not what happened here.	Empa ha se se etsahetseng mona.
Or do not.	Kapa u se etse.
No, no.	Che, che.
Asking the woman's questions like that.	Ho botsa lipotso tsa mosali eo joalo.
I was beginning to feel that way.	Ke ne ke qala ho ikutloa joalo.
Not sure why.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
I still want to try.	Ke ntse ke batla ho leka.
You are hurt.	U utloile bohloko.
And he would do it.	Mme o ne a tla e etsa.
This issue is very important.	Taba ena e bohlokoa haholo.
Also, it is not a problem.	Hape, ha se bothata.
He had a chance now.	O ne a ena le monyetla jwale.
This night.	Hona bosiung bona.
There was no picture behind him.	Ho ne ho sa bonahale setšoantšo ka mor'a hae.
So that's why it exists.	Kahoo ke kahoo e leng teng.
Get to know every man.	Tseba monna e mong le e mong.
That was indeed a sad day.	Ruri leo e ne e le letsatsi le bohloko.
We were working.	Re ne re sebetsa.
It must mean something.	E tlameha ho bolela ho hong.
She was really beautiful.	O ne a le motle ruri.
It's not very fun.	Ha e monate haholo.
They have nothing of that kind.	Ha ba na letho la mofuta oo.
He was already too late.	O ne a se a le morao haholo.
This usually happens after a meal.	Hangata sena se etsahala ka mor'a ho ja.
But it only takes you so far and it works just fine.	Empa e u nka feela ho fihlela joale mme e sebetsa hantle feela.
He refuses to talk to me.	O hana ho bua le nna.
Food must be fresh.	Lijo li tlameha ho ba tse ncha.
He paid on time.	O ile a lefa ka nako.
He left.	O ile a tsamaea.
Soon it will be dangerous and difficult.	Haufinyane e tla ba kotsi le ho ba thata.
But no, that should not be the case.	Empa che, ho ne ho sa lokela ho ba joalo.
The problem was that the teacher could not write.	Bothata e ne e le hore tichere ha e khone ho ngola.
It was not long before he realized that something was amiss.	Ha hoa ka ha feta nako e telele pele a hlokomela hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
However, you are a husband and father.	Leha ho le joalo, u monna le ntate.
She felt that her son did not want her around.	O ne a ikutloa hore mora oa hae ha a mo batle.
But she still refused to let him go.	Empa leha ho le jwalo a hana ho mo tlohela.
Thanks for the comment and the question.	Ke leboha maikutlo le potso.
Well, it finally happened.	Hantle, qetellong e ile ea etsahala.
But no one is coming for me.	Empa ha ho motho ea tlang bakeng sa ka.
One can say something.	Motho a ka bua ho hong.
This is what he was waiting for.	Sena ke seo a neng a se emetse.
None of us can.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea ka khonang.
Then everyone had a job to do.	Joale e mong le e mong o ne a e-na le mosebetsi oo a lokelang ho o etsa.
But we go beyond that.	Empa re feta ho eona.
I knew him well.	Ke ne ke mo tseba hantle.
But the time will come.	Empa nako e tla tla.
Obviously it was a problem.	Ho hlakile hore e ne e le bothata.
It is my opinion that that is not enough.	Ke maikutlo a ka hore hoo ha hoa lekana.
You see.	U bone.
It's my job.	Ke mosebetsi oa ka.
Many children enjoyed playing together.	Bana ba bangata ba ne ba thabela ho bapala hammoho.
That's what he said.	Ke seo a se buileng.
Can you find him?	A na u ka mo fumana?
Some of us have an opinion on everything.	Ba bang ba rona re na le maikutlo ho tsohle.
It is also very fun to read.	Hape ho monate haholo ho bala.
Do group work.	E etse mosebetsi oa sehlopha.
I'd love to hear about this.	Ke rata ho utloa ka sena.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
He asked to read it.	O ile a kōpa ho e bala.
It is not hard to see why.	Ha ho thata ho bona lebaka.
He was drinking.	O ne a ntse a noa.
The police are still going to arrest anyone.	Mapolesa a ntse a tla tšoara mang kapa mang.
I'm not from there.	Ha ke oa moo.
But he was visible.	Empa o ne a bonahala.
Oh, maybe, he lives his.	O, mohlomong, o phela oa hae.
He did not want us to do that.	O ne a sa batle hore re etse joalo.
You will tell me yours.	O tla mpolella tsa hao.
I have to go again next week.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea hape bekeng e tlang.
He returned.	O ile a khutla.
Yet I thought so.	Leha ho le joalo ke ne ke nahana joalo.
It says nothing.	Ha e bue letho.
This week and next.	Bekeng ena le e tlang.
This is a strange thing.	Sena ke ntho e makatsang.
Last time.	Lekhetlo la ho qetela.
We did not make or see everything that was there.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa kapa ra bona ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e neng e le teng moo.
Yet we move on.	Leha ho le joalo re tsoela pele.
But me.	Empa 'na.
I'm not sure what to do.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke etse eng.
You see them very much.	U ba bona haholo.
And if they do not see us, we will stop.	Mme ha ba ka re bona, re tla ema.
Also, beautiful hair is hard to do.	Hape, moriri o motle o thata ho o etsa.
I did not refuse.	Ha kea ka ka hana.
Everyone knows the truth.	Motho e mong le e mong o tseba ’nete.
I do not want anyone to know.	Ha ke batle hore mang kapa mang a tsebe.
Three hours later, he arrived.	Ka mor'a lihora tse tharo, o ile a fihla.
Tom felt guilty.	Tom o ile a ikutloa a le molato.
As we all know.	Joalo ka ha re tseba hantle.
I did nothing.	Ha kea etsa letho.
We can only be here.	Re ka ba mona feela.
We did not sleep.	Ha rea ​​ka ra robala.
I did not sleep last night.	Ha kea ka ka robala bosiung bo fetileng.
We never turned it down.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra e hana.
It is not visible.	Ha e bonahale.
What is he doing now? 	O ntse a etsa eng hona joale?
he thought.	a nahana.
A new one begins.	E ncha e qala.
He left the party prematurely.	O ile a tloha moketeng pele ho nako.
Would that be a good idea?	Na eo e ka ba mokhoa o motle?
We worked together.	Re ile ra sebetsa hammoho.
Life here is hard.	Bophelo ba mona bo boima.
For being here.	Bakeng sa ho ba mona.
This is not good.	Sena ha se molemo.
I've been looking for something like this for a long time.	Ke khale ke batla ntho e kang ena.
It is only a matter of time.	Ke taba ea nako feela.
But that is in the past and in the present.	Empa hoo ke nako e fetileng mme hona joale.
They are even more dangerous.	Li kotsi ho feta.
We find that.	Re fumana joalo.
Very good news.	Litaba tse ntle haholo.
We still need it.	Re ntse re o hloka.
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
Your mother is out.	'M'e oa hau oa tsoa.
It seemed like a good idea.	E ne eka ke mohopolo o motle.
But the other three.	Empa tse ling tse tharo .
Money would not do that.	Chelete e ne e ke ke ea etsa joalo.
They want you.	Ba u batla.
He wondered if it was still worth it.	O ile a ipotsa hore na leha ho le joalo ho molemo.
The fact is, it can happen anywhere.	'Nete ke hore, e ka etsahala kae kapa kae.
I can't.	Ha ke khone.
Sadly, that was not the case.	Ka masoabi, ho ne ho se joalo.
I should have gotten used to it by now.	Ke ne ke lokela hore ebe ke se ke e tloaetse hona joale.
That is what was important.	Ke sona seo e neng e le sa bohlokoa.
If one works well the same as the other.	Haeba e 'ngoe e sebetsa hantle ho joalo le ka e mong.
I see it every day.	Ke e bona letsatsi le letsatsi.
And who knows, maybe they'll go.	Mme ke mang ya tsebang, mohlomong ba tla ya.
Many left the area.	Ba bangata ba ile ba tloha sebakeng seo.
They just know they do.	Ba tseba feela hore ba etsa joalo.
But he did not let it go.	Empa ha aa ka a lumella hore e bonahale.
That's what they do best.	Ke seo ba se etsang ka ho fetisisa.
Usually, it works well.	Hangata, e sebetsa hantle.
I can't sleep well because of the pain.	Ha ke khone ho robala hantle ka lebaka la bohloko.
Hopefully not too long we will find him.	Re tšepa hore ha se nako e telele re tla mo fumana.
So they decide to make a lot of money.	Kahoo ba etsa qeto ea ho etsa chelete e ngata.
Some are just as effective today as ever.	Tse ling li ntse li sebetsa le kajeno joaloka pele.
But, of course, he never did.	Empa, ho hlakile, ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo.
The first thing he did was ask about my family.	Ntho ea pele eo a ileng a e etsa ke ho botsa ka lelapa la ka.
Everyone loves a simple life.	E mong le e mong o rata bophelo bo bonolo.
I'm starting to notice it.	Ke qala ho e hlokomela.
However, make no mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, u se ke ua etsa phoso.
Happy to help.	Ke thabetse ho thusa.
He does a good job.	O etsa mosebetsi o motle.
Negative.	E hlokang molemo.
Do what you can.	Etsa seo u ka se khonang.
But he did not know how much time he had.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe hore na o na le nako e kae.
He made the final decision.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho qetela.
I will study hard.	Ke tla ithuta ka thata.
A lot of people have done that, and it worked.	Batho ba bangata ba entse joalo, 'me ea sebetsa.
These things were coming in and going out.	Lintho tsena li ne li kena le ho kena.
Yet we have to make sure we do it.	Leha ho le joalo re tlameha ho etsa bonnete ba hore rea e etsa.
He never learned to play with them.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ithuta ho bapala le bona.
She looked beautiful.	O ne a shebahala a le motle.
He asks a lot of questions.	O botsa lipotso tse ngata.
You probably do not know.	Mohlomong ha u tsebe.
He may not exist.	E ka 'na eaba ha a eo.
I was afraid to go out.	Ke ne ke tšaba ho tsoa.
It's been a long time.	E se e le nako e telele.
I really like books.	Ke rata libuka haholo.
There must be something he can do to help his friends.	E tlameha ebe ho na le seo a ka se etsang ho thusa metsoalle ea hae.
In this way.	Ka mokhoa ona.
I have to plan and work hard on it.	Ke tlameha ho rera le ho sebetsa ka thata ho eona.
She is so beautiful.	O motle ruri.
Not bad at all.	Ha e mpe hantle.
I think my point.	Ke nahana taba ea ka.
I thought it was fun.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho monate.
He loved her and wanted her.	O ne a mo rata a batla eena.
This is their chance.	Ona ke monyetla oa bona.
I am he, that you may know.	Ke 'na, hore le tsebe.
All that matters is the potential child.	Sohle se bohlokoa ke ngoana ea ka bang teng.
One starts at it.	E mong o qala ho eona.
But then again probably not.	Empa hape mohlomong ha ho joalo.
But really, we did nothing.	Empa ha e le hantle, ha rea ​​ka ra etsa letho.
Probably too much.	Mohlomong e ngata haholo.
That's a really good idea.	Ke mohopolo o motle ruri.
No, yes, no.	Che, e, le che.
The kind of work we want to do.	Mofuta oa mosebetsi oo re batlang ho o etsa.
The rest of the people went to watch the group.	Batho ba bang kaofela ba ea ba shebella le sehlopha.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
And so it was.	Mme ho bile jwalo.
And one more thing.	Le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
So it can be.	Kahoo ho ka ba joalo.
It's hard to watch.	Ho thata ho shebella.
He read everything he could find.	O ne a bala ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo a neng a ka khona ho e fumana.
But we need to go beyond that.	Empa re lokela ho feta moo.
I want you to understand something about this process.	Ke batla hore u utloisise ho hong ka mokhoa ona.
He wasn't wearing it, either.	O ne a sa apara, le hona.
His family knows nothing about this.	Lelapa la hae ha le tsebe letho ka sena.
He got some, but he knew there could be more.	O ile a fumana tse ling, empa a tseba hore ho ka ba le tse ling.
I finally found it.	Qetellong ke e fumane.
Eventually they will call.	Qetellong ba tla letsetsa.
It was clear that this was my life.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore bona ke bophelo ba ka.
I did that for years.	Ke ile ka etsa joalo ka lilemo.
We let it go.	Rea e tlohela.
I will do so if you would like me to do so.	Ke tla etsa joalo haeba le rata hore ke etse joalo.
She used to dress like a job.	O ne a tloaetse ho apara joaloka mosebetsi.
Often, this seems to be the case.	Hangata, ho bonahala ho se ho se joalo.
It seems strange to me.	Ho bonahala e le ntho e makatsang ho nna.
However, that day was not needed.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho sa hlokahale letsatsi leo.
No problem at all.	Ho se na bothata ho hang.
I told you that too.	Ke le boleletse taba eo le nna.
It was as if he were asking a question.	E ne eka o botsa potso.
The whole group here.	Sehlopha sohle mona.
But that is all we can do now.	Empa ke sohle seo re ka se etsang hona joale.
They're getting it.	Ba ntse ba e fumana.
This was the first type of money.	Ena e ne e le mofuta oa pele oa chelete.
You know when.	U tseba neng.
He came to help and finally arrived.	O ile a tla ho tla thusa ’me qetellong a fihla.
That is why he left them together.	Ke ka lebaka leo a ileng a ba tlohela hammoho.
He had a job, and he looked like that.	O ne a e-na le mosebetsi, 'me a shebahala joalo.
You do it because it catches you.	U e etsa hobane e u tšoara.
It can be very fun to watch.	Ho ka ba monate haholo ho shebella.
So they can believe.	Kahoo ba ka lumela.
It gives you strength.	E o fa matla.
There is a greater chance of being great than just going home.	Ho na le monyetla o moholo ho feta ho ba moholo ke ho khutlela hae feela.
We don't need to talk about that.	Ha ho hlokahale hore re bue ka seo.
Or so it was.	Kapa ho ne ho le jwalo.
These are great times!	Tsena ke linako tse monate!.
I went to help her.	Ke ile ka ea mo thusa.
Probably a long time ago.	Mohlomong khale pele ho moo.
Their children did not like them.	Bana ba bona ba ne ba sa ba rate.
They have children.	Ba na le bana.
I hope you like it !.	Ke tšepa hore u e rata!.
Some books are old.	Libuka tse ling ke tsa khale.
I took another one.	Ke ile ka nka e 'ngoe.
I would have thought something had happened.	Ke ne ke tla nahana hore ho na le ntho e etsahetseng.
He would certainly be hurt.	Ka sebele o ne a tla ba bohloko.
I can't or not.	Ha ke khone kapa che.
Don't worry about your feelings.	U se ke ua utloa bohloko ka maikutlo a hao.
And somehow, it is.	'Me ka tsela e itseng, ho joalo.
He was nice to me after that.	O ne a le monate ho nna ka mor'a moo.
Then we.	Ebe re.
However, it is in a strange place.	Leha ho le joalo, e sebakeng se makatsang.
Who I am.	Ke mang.
And then you will know.	Mme ebe o tla tseba.
Her mother was crying.	Mme wa hae o ne a lla.
It was a long time before he spoke.	Ho ile ha feta nako e telele pele a bua.
It once had its own school at the same time.	E kile ea ba le sekolo sa eona ka nako e le 'ngoe.
Needless to say.	Ha ho hlokahale ho bua letho.
Your doctor needs to know these things.	Ngaka ea hau e hloka ho tseba lintho tsena.
There is something wrong.	Ho na le phoso.
I don't care.	Ha ke na taba.
I can't work.	Ha ke khone ho sebetsa.
Only one man can.	Monna a le mong a ka khona.
But it is better at night.	Empa ho molemo bosiu.
That was about me.	Seo se ne se bua ka nna.
I mean just what it was.	Ke bolela feela seo e neng e le sona.
Both were very nice.	Ka bobeli li ne li le ntle haholo.
But they are not heavy.	Empa ha li boima.
It is not surprising.	Ha se ntho e makatsang haholo.
It was just too much for him to notice.	E ne e mpa e le ntho e ngata haholo hore a ka e hlokomela.
More is needed.	Ho hlokahala ho feta.
His time will come.	Nako ea hae e tla tla.
For a long time, too.	Ka nako e telele, hape.
I do not want to be here.	ha ke batle ho ba mona.
I just felt needed.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke hloka feela.
Very well everyone.	Hantle haholo bohle.
I'm glad we went through that and got better for it.	Ke thabile hore ebe re feta moo mme re betere bakeng sa eona.
This is our chance.	Ona ke monyetla oa rona.
That would have to go.	Seo se ne se tla tlameha ho tsamaea.
They had their stuff.	Ba ne ba e-na le lintho tsa bona.
Anyway, I love it.	Leha ho le joalo, kea e rata.
Sometimes this was very true.	Ka linako tse ling sena e ne e le 'nete haholo.
To finish it.	Ho e qeta.
This was not true at all.	Sena e ne e se 'nete ho hang.
Please, you can all stay here.	Ka kopo, le ka lula mona kaofela.
It was the last thing he said to her.	E bile ntho ea ho qetela eo a ileng a e bua ho eena.
I will make sure to do so.	Ke tla etsa bonnete ba ho etsa joalo.
I want to look at it again.	Ke batla ho o sheba hape.
In fact, he is leaving now.	Ha e le hantle, oa tsamaea hona joale.
I was also really talking.	Le ’na ke ne ke hlile ke bolela.
However, do not be too sure.	Leha ho le joalo, u se ke ua ba le bonnete haholo.
It was as if it were yours.	E ne eka ke tsa hao.
He had to keep it together.	O ne a tlameha ho e boloka hammoho.
However, I did not sleep.	Leha ho le joalo, ha kea robala.
Swimming was his favorite activity.	Ho sesa e ne e le mosebetsi oo a neng a o rata haholo.
People consider it very important.	Batho ba e nka e le ea bohlokoa haholo.
I think you can understand both.	Ke nahana hore le ka utloisisa bobeli.
Anyway I can try it.	Leha ho le joalo nka e leka.
I just want to go.	Ke batla ho tsamaea feela.
He was not sure.	O ne a se na bonnete.
We have no way of knowing who you are.	Ha re na mokhoa oa ho tseba hore na u mang.
It went on for hours.	E ile ea tsoela pele ka lihora tse ngata.
I want to be beautiful.	Ke batla ho ba motle.
He should not have been present.	O ne a sa lokela ho ba teng.
There is a mother too.	Ho na le mme hape.
My children.	Bana ba ka.
And you have a lot of people who are good at this.	'Me u na le batho ba bangata ba molemo ho sena.
They do not go.	Ha ba tsamaee.
I am sure that	Ke bonnete ba hore
It was, to me.	E ne e le, ho nna.
It would have been better if I had never opened them.	Ho ka be ho bile molemo hore le ka mohla ke se ke ka li bula.
Get a new car.	Fumana koloi e ncha.
They did it.	Ke bona ba e entseng.
Make sure there is a parking space.	Etsa bonnete ba hore ho na le sebaka sa ho ema.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Sena ha se ntho e mpe.
You see, I did not do this.	O ya bona, ha se nna ya entseng ntho ena.
Another boy came to him and gave everything he had.	Moshanyana e mong o ile a tla ho eena ’me a fana ka sohle seo a nang le sona.
She is just fine.	O hantle feela.
I know how it is.	Kea tseba hore na ho joang.
He was wondering about that picture.	O ne a ntse a ipotsa ka setšoantšo seo.
Many of them have children.	Ba bangata ba bona ba na le bana.
She was so beautiful now.	O ne a le motle haholo jwale.
Not necessarily harmful, but.	Hase hakaalo hore e kotsi, empa.
I thought nothing of it.	Ke ne ke sa nahane letho ka eona.
Well, this is what happened.	Hantle, sena ke se etsahetseng.
We need to know what happened.	Re lokela ho tseba se etsahetseng.
This is an amazing place.	Sena ke sebaka se makatsang.
Try not to take it for granted.	Leka hore u se ke ua e nka e le ea bohlokoa haholo.
Ask for the back room.	Kopa kamore e ka morao.
Again.	Hape.
But we are useless.	Empa ha re na molemo.
I'm going now.	Ke ea hona joale.
He did not even know if he should go to meet her.	O ne a bile a sa tsebe hore na o lokela ho ea kopana le eena.
What would that look like?	Seo se ka shebahala joang?
Somehow, it was.	Ka tsela e itseng, ho ne ho le joalo.
However, it was more than that.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho feta moo.
We do not take what does not belong to us.	Ha re nke seo e seng sa rona.
They just want time.	Ba batla nako feela.
Work was preparing food.	Mosebetsi o ne a ntse a lokisa lijo.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
In fact, they can both be at work.	Ha e le hantle, ka bobeli ba ka ba mosebetsing.
You can have them.	U ka ba le tsona.
We will understand something.	Re tla utloisisa ho hong.
This will be soon.	Sena haufinyane.
It was very easy, this.	Ho ne ho le bonolo haholo, sena.
And then once again.	Mme hape hang hape.
He plans to do another one sometime.	O rera ho etsa e 'ngoe ka nako e' ngoe.
I really enjoyed that meal.	Ka sebele ke ile ka thabela lijo tseo haholo.
Some did not.	Ba bang ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
None of these things worked.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea lintho tsena e ileng ea sebetsa.
He had a serious problem with books.	O ne a e-na le bothata bo lekaneng ba libuka.
This was obvious.	Sena se ne se hlakile.
We have to do that work.	Re tlameha ho etsa mosebetsi oo.
Go back to our bedroom.	Khutlela kamoreng ea rona ea ho robala.
Children like him do not like him.	Bana ba kang eena ha ba mo rate.
Ever since she realized that her son was telling the truth.	Ho tloha ha a hlokomela hore mora oa hae o ne a ntse a bua 'nete.
However, so far this has not been the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho fihlela joale sena ha se e-s'o be joalo.
This can work very well, too.	Sena se ka sebetsa hantle haholo, hape.
He had problems before.	O ne a na le mathata pele.
But you really must.	Empa ehlile u tlameha.
I am a mother.	Ke 'm'e.
I was not sure which one.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ke efe.
I do not know what you are talking about.	Ha ke tsebe hore na u bua ka eng.
But there was more to come.	Empa ho ne ho sa ntse ho e-na le tse ling tse tlang.
I'm tired of trying to believe in myself.	Ke khathetse ke ho leka ho lumela ho 'na.
He never wanted to be like that.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a batla ho ba joalo.
After that, go back.	Ka mor'a moo, khutlela morao.
He is no longer anything to me.	Ha a sa le letho ho nna.
Things will not go your way.	Lintho ha li na ho tsamaea ka tsela ea hau.
His parents were no exception.	Batsoali ba hae le bona ba ne ba le joalo.
Or so.	Kapa ho joalo.
You trust him, though you do not know why.	Ua mo tšepa le hoja u sa tsebe lebaka.
I found nothing better.	Ha kea ka ka fumana letho le betere.
The children were very happy.	Bana ba ne ba thabile haholo.
I like news.	Ke rata litaba.
There was no question about that.	Ho ne ho se potso ka seo.
You should too.	Le uena u lokela ho etsa joalo.
It is very important to understand this.	Ho bohlokoa haholo ho utloisisa sena.
Look at his place.	Sheba sebaka sa hae.
I would not say.	Ke ne nke ke ka bolela.
For many people.	Bakeng sa batho ba bangata.
I just don't care right now.	Ke mpa ke sa tsotelle hona joale.
When we do that.	Ha re etsa ntho eo.
I am human.	Ke motho.
It looks like a lifelong career.	E shebahala joalo ka mosebetsi oa bophelo bohle.
I did not want to.	Ke ne ke sa batle.
I have to see it.	Ke tlameha ho o bona.
I do not plan to drink today.	Ha kea rera ho noa kajeno.
Maybe they'll forget about it.	Mohlomong ba tla lebala ka eona.
Never leave.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua tloha.
Read to understand.	Bala ho utloisisa.
Better that way.	Betere ka tsela eo.
Probably even before.	Mohlomong le pele.
But now, it had taken time for that to happen.	Empa joale, ho ne ho nkile nako ho etsahala.
We will leave soon.	Re tla tsamaea kapele.
I was not expecting to be here this morning.	Ke ne ke sa lebella ho ba mona hoseng.
I'm coming.	Ke ntse ke tla.
I can't go to him.	Ha ke khone ho ea ho eena.
Nothing happens at the time you want it.	Ha ho letho le etsahalang ka nako eo u e batlang.
In time, they would get what they wanted.	Ha nako e ntse e ea ba ne ba tla fumana seo ba se batlang.
They are mine.	Li ho tsa ka.
Maybe we can go there a little more often.	Mohlomong re ka ea moo hangata hanyane.
My whole family is.	Lelapa la ka kaofela le.
So he returned immediately.	Kahoo o ile a khutla kapele.
It's never too close.	Ha e eso be haufi le ho feta.
He was talking about his children.	O ne a bua ka bana ba hae.
I haven't read anything.	Ha kea bala letho.
That is where we would live.	Ke hona moo re neng re tla lula teng.
What's the matter?	Molato ke ofe?
And this was exactly what it was.	Mme sena e ne e le sona seo.
Well, here it is.	Be, ke ena.
Find out what happened and where he is.	Fumana se etsahetseng le moo a leng teng.
I was not.	Ke ne ke se joalo.
Tomorrow, it's yours.	Hosane, ke wa hao.
She saw him for the first time.	O ile a mo bona lekhetlo la pele.
It was not painful.	Ho ne ho se bohloko.
However, this is very easy to fix.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se bonolo haholo ho se lokisa.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha ho joalo.
I can't reach it then.	Ha ke khone ho e fihlela ka nako eo.
See a doctor if you feel tired.	Sheba ngaka haeba u ikutloa u khathetse.
Because they are here.	Hobane ba teng mona.
That's great.	Ke hantle haholo.
But, you need to meet them.	Empa, o hloka ho kopana le bona.
It's yours if you want it.	Ke ea hau haeba u e batla.
I would never know how to get anything.	Ke ne nke ke ka tseba mokhoa oa ho fumana letho.
He needed a day to convince her.	O ne a hloka letsatsi ho mo kholisa.
They walk out.	Ba tsamaea ba tsoa.
You can't do that.	O ka se etse seo.
I'm not sure about everything.	Ha ke na bonnete ka tsohle.
This is a true question.	Ena ke potso ea 'nete.
I did not like that.	Ha kea ka ka thabela seo.
We do it a lot.	Re e etsa haholo.
They did not need to be friends.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale hore e be metsoalle.
He does not want to come.	Ha a batle ho tla.
It needs to come out.	Ho hlokahala ho tsoa.
We thought it might just be his style.	Re ne re nahana hore mohlomong ke mokhoa oa hae feela.
If you want what you can think of.	Haeba u batla seo u ka se nahanang.
But this is good for the children.	Empa sena se molemo ho bana.
Even if you get the best.	Leha o fumane tse ntle ka ho fetisisa.
And it is still possible.	'Me ho ntse ho ka etsahala.
To be fair, of course.	Ha re bua hantle, ehlile.
He told her he was leaving.	O ile a mo bolella hore oa tsamaea.
Anyone realizes this except me.	Mang kapa mang o hlokomela sena ntle le nna.
He can eat.	A ka ja.
I have been doing that for several years.	Ke na le lilemo tse 'maloa ke etsa joalo.
I will not go out.	Nke ke ka tsoa.
You think she is beautiful.	U mo nka a le motle.
Maybe he got a job because he was good.	Mohlomong o fumane mosebetsi hobane a le motle.
This is more true today than ever before.	Sena ke ’nete kajeno ho feta leha e le neng pele.
You do not have to do this.	Ha o a tlameha ho etsa sena.
That kind of sometimes you never think of yourself.	Mofuta oo ka linako tse ling ha ho mohla u nahanang ka uena.
It could have happened, but it did not.	E ne e ka ba teng, empa ha ea ka ea etsahala.
Sometimes you can use money to get someone to talk.	Ka linako tse ling u ka sebelisa chelete ho etsa hore motho a bue.
Really hard to reach.	Ka sebele ho thata ho fihla.
I saw something else.	Ke ile ka bona ho hong hape.
Moreover, they need time to play.	Ho feta moo, ba hloka nako ea ho bapala.
People were going to and from where he was.	Batho ba ne ba ntse ba ya le ho tloha moo a neng a le teng.
I felt so much better this way.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke le betere haholo ka tsela ena.
This would be his room.	Ena e ne e tla ba kamore ea hae.
It's four years again.	Ke lilemo tse 'ne hape.
He is still alive.	O ntse a phela.
I think that would be a problem.	Ke nahana hore hoo e tla ba bothata.
So good work to do.	Kahoo mosebetsi o motle oa ho o etsa.
But they are not.	Empa ha ba eo.
Of course we are moving forward.	Ehlile re ntse re tsoela pele.
You must love to travel.	U tlameha ho rata ho tsamaea.
There are many.	Ho na le tse ngata.
I will not try to do what they did.	Ha ke na ho leka ho etsa seo ba se entseng.
Clearly, the issue was strong.	Ho hlakile hore taba e ne e le matla.
But he did not comment on the matter.	Empa ha aa ka a bua ka taba eo.
I can no longer speak.	Ha ke sa khona ho bua.
Or a car.	Kapa koloi.
They were certainly in their group.	Ka sebele ba ne ba le sehlopheng sa bona.
However, he could not go back now.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa khone ho khutlela morao joale.
We must always seek.	Re tlameha ho batla ka linako tsohle.
I didn’t think he could tell me.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore a ka mpolella.
It looks back.	E sheba morao.
If we do not, we will be here for a long time.	Haeba re sa etse joalo, re tla ba mona nako e telele.
Now it is too late.	Joale nako e se e le morao haholo.
It soon became easy to see why.	Kapele ho ile ha e-ba bonolo ho bona lebaka.
I know this very well.	Ke tseba sena hantle.
It's still waiting.	E ntse e emetse.
Some are leaving.	Ba bang ba tsamaea.
We'll have to wait and see.	Re tla tlameha ho ema re bone.
It was too late, it was too late.	E ne e se e le morao haholo, e se e le morao haholo.
I think so.	Ke nahana hore ho joalo.
Because it can be helpful to you.	Hobane e ka ba thuso ho uena.
Find out where the school is.	Fumana moo sekolo se leng teng.
You are not sure what they are using now.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na ba sebelisa eng hona joale.
I didn't like the way they talked.	Ke ne ke sa rate tsela eo ba neng ba bua ka eona.
Some people are afraid to go out at night alone.	Batho ba bang ba tšaba ho tsamaea bosiu ba le bang.
News was important at the time.	Litaba li ne li le bohlokoa ka nako eo.
And these are the very best people.	'Me bana ke batho ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
You could not sit next to him without feeling.	U ne u ke ke ua lula haufi le eena ntle le ho ikutloa.
I know this because everyone tells everyone how much fun it is.	Ke tseba sena hobane bohle ba bolella motho e mong le e mong hore na ho monate hakae.
Many will not let you do it.	Ba bangata ba ke ke ba u lumella ho e etsa.
I doubt it is possible.	Ke belaela hore na ke ntho e ka etsahalang.
People have done that before.	Batho ba kile ba etsa joalo pele.
He knew it all at once.	A e tseba kaofela hang.
If you were expecting something else, you do not know him well.	Haeba u ne u lebeletse ntho e 'ngoe hape, ha u mo tsebe hantle.
He was not the same person as last week.	E ne e se motho ea tšoanang le bekeng e fetileng.
I didn't think much of it.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hakaalo ka eona.
Or you can't reach them.	Kapa ha u khone ho ba fihlela.
He did not get home.	Ha a ka a fihla hae.
Then he looked embarrassed.	Eaba o shebahala a le lihlong.
Friends would come.	Metsoalle e ne e tla.
Or indeed.	Kapa ha e le hantle.
He was always the strongest.	E ne e le eena ea matla kamehla.
If you get caught, you will not enjoy it.	Haeba u ka tšoaroa, u ke ke ua e thabela.
I play better.	Ke bapala betere.
It exists.	E teng.
He does what he wants to do.	O etsa ntho eo a batlang ho e etsa.
Maybe I'll come back to find more.	Mohlomong ke tla khutla ho tla fumana tse ling.
Hard work.	Mosebetsi o boima.
For what, he did not know.	Bakeng sa eng, o ne a sa tsebe.
It will be difficult.	Ho tla ba thata.
You have to trust him.	U tlameha ho mo tšepa.
Finally you can sleep.	Qetellong u ka robala.
So can we meet in your area? 	Joale na re ka kopana sebakeng sa hau?
One of them is water.	E 'ngoe ea tsona ke metsi.
I'm glad he's coming.	Ke thabetse hore ebe oa tla.
I knew the place.	Ke ne ke tseba sebaka seo.
From there.	Ho tsoa moo.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
He always	A kamehla
It was a good thing to know.	E ne e le ntho e ntle ho tseba.
When one is sure there is a reason.	Ha motho a e-na le bonnete ba hore ho na le lebaka.
I enjoyed that.	Ke ile ka thabela seo.
Then we feed them.	Joale re ba fa lijo.
At that time.	Ka nako eo.
That it is not so dangerous.	Hore ha e kotsi hakaalo.
We will play hard.	Re tla bapala ka matla.
I should not let you go.	Ha kea lokela ho u lumella hore u tsamaee.
But nothing helped.	Empa ha ho letho le ileng la thusa.
To certain people.	Ho batho ba itseng.
I don't like to talk too much about it.	Ha ke rate ho bua haholo ka eona.
The young man realized that he had made a mistake.	Mohlankana eo o ile a hlokomela hore o entse phoso.
Let it be so.	E mpe e be jwalo.
However, by then it will be too late.	Leha ho le joalo, ka nako eo e tla be e se e le morao haholo.
Go ahead and you will get there.	Tsoela pele 'me u tla fihla moo.
Many are innocent enough and it means you are not harmed.	Ba bangata ha ba na molato ka ho lekaneng 'me ho bolela hore ha u na kotsi.
The issue was not really new.	Taba eo ha e le hantle e ne e se ncha.
So they did just that.	Kahoo, ba ile ba etsa sona seo.
We need to fix that.	Re lokela ho lokisa seo.
Someone wanted to know something.	Ho na le motho ea neng a batla ho tseba ho hong.
The same is true of the present situation.	Ho joalo le ka boemo ba hona joale.
It comes from the police.	E tsoa mapolesa.
Just look at you.	Sheba wena feela.
All or all of his thoughts.	Tsohle kapa tseo a nahanang ka tsona.
We did not know what they were doing.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na ba ntse ba etsa eng.
They really looked happy.	Ba ne ba hlile ba shebahala ba thabile.
You did not come.	Ha ua tla.
At that time there was still nothing.	Ka nako eo ho ne ho ntse ho se letho.
We will not talk about it now.	Ha re na ho bua ka eona hona joale.
It was true.	E ne e le 'nete.
Be with it.	Eba ka eona.
It's really simple.	E bonolo ruri.
But it is human life.	Empa ke bophelo ba motho.
One can trust !.	Motho a ka tšepa!.
Tell him how it goes.	Mo bolelle hore na ho tsamaea joang.
I look forward to this.	Ke lebeletse sena haholo.
He has been going on for years.	O ntse a tsoela pele ka lilemo.
It was a difficult time.	E ne e le nako e thata.
You can get them to say whatever you want to say.	U ka etsa hore ba bue eng kapa eng eo u batlang ho e bua.
It's weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang.
He seems to know a lot about the girl.	Ho bonahala eka o tseba haholo ka ngoanana eo.
He does not know this.	Ha a tsebe taba ena.
Any kind of help seemed good.	Mofuta ofe kapa ofe oa thuso o ne o bonahala o le molemo.
He has too many books.	O na le libuka tse ngata haholo.
It will happen the same way to you.	Ho tla etsahala ka tsela eo le ho wena.
Everyone was healthy, well.	E mong le e mong o ne a phela hantle, hantle.
But you can see a lot.	Empa u ka bona haholo.
It's too hard for me.	Ho boima haholo ho nna.
It was always there.	E ne e le teng kamehla.
Crying even more.	Ho lla le ho feta.
He works with energy money.	O sebetsa ka chelete ea matla.
Everyone has their own ideas about what to do.	E mong le e mong o na le maikutlo a hae a hore na o lokela ho etsa joang.
Go or go home.	Tsamaea kapa u ee hae.
I'm not very good.	Ha ke hantle haholo.
I can see why.	Ke khona ho bona lebaka.
What is the benefit of going forward.	Molemo oa ho ea pele ke ofe.
I don't think much of his friends.	Ha ke nahane hakaalo ka metsoalle ea hae.
Her husband is not a simple person.	Monna oa hae ha se motho ea bonolo.
Good idea.	Mohopolo o motle.
I was not very helpful to the police.	Ke ne ke se na thuso ho mapolesa haholo.
Instead, you should ride a bicycle, walk, or drive.	Ho e-na le hoo, u lokela ho palama baesekele, ho tsamaea kapa ho khanna.
An essential element of human life.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ea ho phela ha motho.
Then he took the money with him.	Eaba o nka chelete le eena.
I was thinking about it.	Ke ne ke ntse ke nahana ka eona.
Money was nothing.	Chelete e ne e se letho.
That is where he lived.	Ke hona moo a neng a lula teng.
This rule is clear.	Molao ona o hlakile.
We need to find a better place.	Re hloka ho fumana sebaka se betere.
There would have been a better day for this.	Ho ka be ho bile le letsatsi le betere bakeng sa hona.
We had a wonderful family life.	Re ne re e-na le bophelo bo monate ba lelapa.
I don’t think we still exist.	Ha ke nahane hore re ntse re le teng.
And we did that.	Mme re ile ra etsa seo.
Go too fast.	Tsamaea kapele haholo.
It was no surprise.	Ho ne ho se ntho e makatsang.
You know what they are like.	Ua tseba hore na ba joang.
Although not all of them.	Leha e se kaofela ha bona.
Such a ride.	Ho palama ho joalo.
The man had to ask.	Monna o ile a tlameha ho botsa.
He did the only thing he could think of to do.	O entse ntho feela eo a neng a ka nahana ho e etsa.
But you were children.	Empa le ne le le bana.
I'm so sorry to read about this.	Ke masoabi haholo ha ke bala ka sena.
I will be fine now.	Ke tla phela hantle jwale.
He is learning as he walks.	O ntse a ithuta ha a ntse a tsamaea.
She did not seem to be afraid of him.	O ne a sa bonahale a mo tšaba haholo.
It is speaking rather than speaking.	Ke ho bua ho e-na le ho bua.
Which they would not do.	E leng seo ba neng ba ke ke ba se etsa.
See if you can figure out what it is.	Bona hore na u ka tseba hore na ke efe.
I do not know what will happen to me.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ho tla etsahala'ng ka 'na.
They usually talk too fast for me.	Hangata ba bua kapele haholo bakeng sa ka.
Have a nice day.	Eba le letsatsi le monate.
To be with him.	Ho ba le eena.
He did it.	O e entse.
Never doubt it.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua e belaela.
It looks good.	E bonahala e le ntle.
There is no question about that.	Haho potso ka seo.
I told him it was coming.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore e tla.
None of them have ever seen such.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea kileng a bona tse joalo pele.
Whatever was going to happen, it was going to happen.	Eng kapa eng e neng e tla etsahala, e ne e tla etsahala.
Now we see more.	Joale re bona ho feta.
He does.	O etsa jwalo.
He had no place for anything else.	O ne a se na sebaka sa ntho leha e le efe e 'ngoe.
We need new ones.	Re hloka tse ncha.
They both look down.	Bobeli ba bona ba sheba fatše.
He told us what he did.	O re boleletse seo a se entseng.
I really did it.	Ke hlile ke e entse.
I knew it well.	Ke ne ke e tseba hantle.
My house usually has enough to eat.	Hangata ntlo ea ka e na le lijo tse lekaneng.
Fun, please, this way.	Monate, ka kopo, ka tsela ena.
I was very happy at the time.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo ka nako eo.
You feel the need for others to love you.	U utloa ho hlokahala hore ba bang ba u rate.
The fact is, it was a work in progress.	'Nete ke hore e ne e le mosebetsi.
Moving on with your life.	Ho tsoela pele ka bophelo ba hau.
Some faster than others.	Ba bang kapele ho feta ba bang.
One has to know something.	Motho o tlameha ho tseba ho hong.
What he says cannot be true.	Seo a se buang e ke ke ea e-ba 'nete.
He is making coffee.	O ntse a etsa kofi.
These people know exactly what you've been through.	Batho bana ba tseba hantle seo o fetileng ho sona.
And she was alive.	Mme o ne a ntse a phela.
There is more to them than that.	Ho na le ho feta ka tsona.
He was sure.	O ne a bile le bonnete.
There were only three of them there.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse tharo feela tsa tsona moo.
I would not eat it.	Ke ne nke ke ka e ja.
That house means something to you.	Ntlo eo e bolela ho hong ho uena.
I like watching him.	Ke rata ho mo shebella.
What was wrong with him?	Phoso e ne e le efe ka eena?
That's their life, that's their life.	Ke bophelo ba bona boo, ke bophelo ba bona.
You don't want it, of course.	Ha o e batle, ho hlakile.
This is powerful.	Sena se matla.
I would love to do this for my career in some way.	Nka rata ho etsa sena mosebetsi oa ka ka tsela e itseng.
I have never seen him really sit down and study.	Ha ke e-s'o mo bone a hlile a lula fatše 'me a ithuta.
Need help? 	U hloka thuso?
They offer a way back home.	Ba fana ka tsela ea ho khutlela hae.
If you still feel that way you can go.	Haeba u ntse u ikutloa joalo u ka tsamaea.
However, that day is not today.	Leha ho le joalo, letsatsi leo ha se kajeno.
We will get back to it.	Re tla khutlela ho eona.
That's it.	Ke taba eo.
The task is easy to have.	Mosebetsi o bonolo ho ba le.
It is better to use it.	Ho molemo ho e sebelisa.
So be careful!	Kahoo hlokomela!
They work for me.	Ba sebetsa bakeng sa ka.
Everyone knew what was most important.	E mong le e mong o ne a tseba seo e leng sa bohlokoa haholo.
There is something strange.	Ho na le ntho e makatsang.
It exists now.	E teng hona joale.
He could not finish the meal.	Ha aa ka a khona ho qeta lijo.
It still may not be enough.	E ntse e ka 'na ea se ke ea lekana.
I did not cry.	Ha kea ka ka lla.
I had such a wonderful time.	Ke bile le nako e monate hakana.
This is a fact.	Taba ena ke 'nete.
I have nothing to do.	Ha ke na seo nka se etsang.
But that’s my point.	Empa ke taba ea ka.
It was clear.	Ho ne ho hlakile.
The day was beautiful.	Letsatsi le ne le le monate.
He says he will want to see them if he can.	O re o tla batla ho ba bona ha a ka khona.
It was probably even more important.	Mohlomong e ne e le ea bohlokoa ho feta.
So there it is.	Kahoo ho na le hoo.
She must have had a baby the first night here.	E tlameha ebe o ile a ba le ngoana bosiung ba pele mona.
The coffee is delicious.	Kofi e monate.
But they did not go anywhere.	Empa ha baa ka ba ea kae kapa kae.
However, I do not know.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe.
Clearly he saw.	Ho hlakile hore o ile a bona.
This is obvious.	Sena se hlakile.
I'm afraid it never did.	Ke tšaba hore ha e so ka e etsa joalo.
There is no easy place.	Ha ho sebaka se bonolo.
It does its job.	E etsa mosebetsi oa eona.
A man who had a legal problem.	Monna ea neng a e-na le bothata ba molao.
Find out if it is.	Tseba ha e le teng.
Her parents spend a lot of time with her.	Batsoali ba hae ba qeta nako e ngata le eena.
However, questions remain, and it will probably take a long time.	Leha ho le joalo, lipotso li ntse li le teng, 'me mohlomong li tla nka nako e telele.
But he was still finding time to inquire about my health.	Empa o ne a ntse a fumana nako ea ho botsa ka bophelo ba ka.
I will not use them.	Nke ke ka li sebelisa.
But the opportunity was there.	Empa monyetla o ne o le teng.
He was, he is.	O ne a le teng, o teng.
This, too, will not work.	Sena, le sona, se ke ke sa sebetsa.
Over time, this can be dangerous.	Ha nako e ntse e ea, sena se ka ba kotsi.
I understand him.	Kea mo utloisisa.
It is still true today.	E ntse e le 'nete le kajeno.
We are your life.	Re bophelo ba hau.
But it does not stay there.	Empa ha e lule moo.
There will be no riding on his bike.	Ha ho na ho palama baesekele ea hae.
I could see very well.	Ke ne ke bona hantle haholo.
You left me at that point.	U ile ua tloha ho 'na ka nako eo.
Empty.	E se nang letho.
I tried to think it through.	Ke ile ka leka ho e nahana hantle.
I don't want to do that either.	Le 'na ha ke batle ho etsa joalo hape.
None of these things exist.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea lintho tsena e teng.
I do not know how to do that.	Ha ke tsebe ho etsa seo.
You did not speak for me.	Ha ua bua bakeng sa ka.
It looked bad.	E ne e bonahala e le mpe.
So go ahead.	Kahoo tsoela pele.
In fact, it is very bad.	Ka 'nete, e mpe haholo.
We did not.	Re ne re se na.
There is no such place.	Haho sebaka se joalo.
If you could do that it would look good.	Haeba u ne u ka etsa joalo ho ne ho tla bonahala e le ntle.
He did not like that dog.	O ne a sa rate ntja eo.
If you have a family.	Haeba u na le lelapa.
In the end, everyone went.	Qetellong, bohle ba ile.
They are people with a certain attitude.	Ke batho ba nang le maikutlo a itseng.
The party is fun.	Mokete o monate.
It is very important.	Se bohlokoa haholo.
Get enough hours a day to do everything.	Fumana lihora tse lekaneng ka letsatsi ho etsa tsohle.
And you know you can do it.	'Me oa tseba hore u ka e etsa.
Thanks for your help.	Ke leboha thuso ea hau.
He just said it.	O sa tsoa e bua.
It takes too much time.	Ho nka nako e ngata haholo.
But there are others.	Empa ho na le ba bang hape.
They have been doing it for some time.	Ke khale ba e etsa ka tsela e itseng.
We have something we want to do, with this.	Re na le seo re batlang ho se etsa, ka sena.
We fear for our lives.	Re tšaba bophelo ba rona.
I can't speak well.	Ha ke khone ho bua hantle.
He knew nothing about what had happened to him.	O ne a sa tsebe letho ka se etsahetseng ho eena.
I think they know that.	Ke nahana hore ba tseba seo.
I don't have to make a decision right now.	Ha kea tlameha ho etsa qeto hona joale.
It worked.	E ile ea sebetsa.
It starts.	E qala.
He does not talk to anyone, he stays alone.	Ha a bue le motho, o dula a le mong.
I'm glad to be back.	Ke thabetse ho khutla.
There was another reason.	Ho ne ho e-na le lebaka le leng.
But we often talk about life.	Empa hangata re bua ka bophelo.
Think about what you want.	Nahana ka seo u se batlang.
Don't say that.	O seke wa bua jwalo.
And he is doing it.	Mme o ntse a e etsa.
People do not always know what they need.	Hase kamehla batho ba tsebang seo ba se hlokang.
Everything can happen now.	Lintho tsohle li ka etsahala hona joale.
A child has many things that he or she wants.	Ngoana o na le lintho tse ngata tseo a li batlang.
I have a very good idea.	Ke na le mohopolo o motle haholo.
From his room.	Ho tloha kamoreng ea hae.
I never told you.	Ha ke eso o bolelle.
It is their job.	Ke mosebetsi oa bona.
But still, it came down to earth.	Empa leha ho le joalo, e ile ea fihla fatše.
But we must find our name.	Empa re tlameha ho fumana lebitso la rona.
But he had never told her no.	Empa o ne a e-so ka a mo bolella che.
He worked hard for many years.	O ile a sebetsa ka thata ka lilemo tse ngata.
We don't know why, and that doesn't matter.	Ha re tsebe lebaka, mme seo ha se na taba.
Nobody seems to be doing that.	Ha ho bonahale ho na le motho ea etsang joalo.
Thank you, that is very good.	Kea leboha, hoo ho molemo haholo.
He was so fast.	O ne a le kapele hakaalo.
It seemed like a good idea.	E ne eka ke mohopolo o motle.
But it was useless.	Empa ho ne ho se na thuso.
Don't think too hard.	U se ke ua nahana ka thata haholo.
Of course, this was going to happen.	Ehlile, sena se ne se tla etsahala.
He could watch.	O ne a ka shebella.
In your opinion, he is not.	Ho ea kamoo u nahanang kateng, ha a eo.
He suffers with it in a new way.	O utloa bohloko le eona ka tsela e ncha.
He had heard.	O ne a utloile.
It was really fun.	Ka sebele ho ne ho le monate haholo.
And it is important to understand.	'Me ho bohlokoa ho utloisisa.
We do not know what to do about it.	Ha re tsebe hore na re etse eng ka hona.
Moreover, he made it easy.	Ho feta moo, o ile a etsa hore ho be bonolo.
They can keep it.	Ba ka e boloka.
I seem to have problems almost every now and then.	Ho bonahala eka ke na le mathata hoo e ka bang nako le nako hona joale.
I am just a child.	Ke ngoana feela.
Yes, he reads well.	E, o bala hantle.
Can you prepare a meal tonight?	A na u ka lokisa lijo bosiung bona?
But they don't do anything like that.	Empa ha ba etse letho la mofuta oo.
We did not meet with them.	Ha rea ​​ka ra kopana le bona.
Like his father, he was crying.	Joaloka ntate oa hae, o ne a ntse a lla.
Because you are not.	Hobane ha u joalo.
Because my name is in it.	Hobane lebitso la ka le ho eona.
I have seen him, just like many others.	Le 'na ke mo bone, joalo ka ba bangata.
They were equal now.	Ba ne ba lekana jwale.
Something terrible was happening.	Ho ne ho etsahala ntho e mpe.
The family has been living in this area for many years.	Lelapa le qetile lilemo tse ngata le lula sebakeng sena.
But you would probably not do that.	Empa ho hlakile hore u ne u ke ke ua etsa joalo.
I did nothing wrong.	Ha kea etsa letho le phoso.
That is why it is a picture.	Ke kahoo e leng setšoantšo.
First of all, why did they get that.	Taba ea pele, ke hobane'ng ha ba ile ba fumana seo.
Other than that, there is not much we can say about it.	Ntle le moo, ha ho na lintho tse ngata tseo re ka li buang ka eona.
But they did.	Empa ba etsa joalo.
He was done.	O ne a se a qetile.
Notice that.	Hlokomela seo.
Yes, one.	Ee, o mong.
As a result .	Kahoo .
He may think he wants to see her.	A ka nahana hore o batla ho mo bona.
We have to come to it.	Re tlameha ho tla ho eona.
But he went on.	Empa a tsoela pele.
If only something.	Haeba feela ho hong.
I didn't know you very well.	Ke ne ke sa u tsebe hakaalo.
It is better not to think too much about it.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua nahana haholo ka eona.
How old was it.	E ne e le khale hakae.
They have never been like that.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba joalo.
I have to go.	Ke 'na ea lokelang ho tsamaea.
That keeps it new.	Seo se boloka e le ncha.
There is something strange about them.	Ho na le ntho e makatsang ka bona.
I had it.	Ke ne ke e-na le eona.
Maybe he did.	Mohlomong o ile a etsa joalo.
Everyone uses it.	E mong le e mong oa e sebelisa.
And it's not just them.	Mme ha se bona feela.
We also did not talk much.	Le rona ha rea ​​bua haholo.
The doctor found nothing wrong with her.	Ngaka ha ea ka ea fumana letho le phoso ka eena.
Some may even say that it is not fun.	Ba bang ba ka ba ba re ha e monate.
I can no longer sit much back.	Ha ke sa khona ho lula morao haholo.
And we had it all, you know.	Mme re ne re na le tsohle, le a tseba.
It didn't matter now.	Ho ne ho se taba jwale.
We would not do that.	Re ka be re sa etse joalo.
You will know.	O tla tseba.
Instead, he went to them.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a ea ho bona.
This is a very important job.	Ona ke mosebetsi oa bohlokoa haholo.
We will be fine.	Re tla phela hantle.
Do you know that it is the same with us.	Na ua tseba hore ke ntho e tšoanang le rona.
Get in the right place.	Kena sebakeng hantle.
Some are not so.	Tse ling ha li joalo haholo.
I still have to read about it.	Ke ntse ke tlameha ho bala ka eona.
This was happening.	Sena se ne se etsahala.
Someone has been there.	E mong o bile teng.
He did not know what to do with it.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng ka hona.
Of course they will.	Ho hlakile hore ba tla etsa joalo.
More than my type.	Ho feta mofuta oa ka.
On another occasion, someone helped us.	Ka lekhetlo le leng, e mong o ile a re thusa.
They left because of them.	Ba ile ba tloha ka lebaka la bona.
Life goes fast out here.	Bophelo bo tsamaea kapele ka ntle mona.
It could be this or nothing.	E ka ba sena kapa ha ho letho.
But there was no time.	Empa ho ne ho se na nako.
But he wanted to know.	Empa o ne a batla ho tseba.
Read about your risk.	Bala ka kotsi ea hau.
And he eats it.	'Me oa mo ja.
I heard him.	Ke mo utloile.
People would be there.	Batho ba ne ba tla ba teng.
You can buy them or make them.	U ka li reka kapa ua li etsa.
Then do something.	Ebe u etsa ho hong.
Probably not before.	Mohlomong ha se pele.
That would be better.	Hoo ho ka ba molemo.
That was my question.	Eo e ne e le potso ea ka.
In my opinion, you have done a great job this year.	Ka maikutlo a ka, u entse mosebetsi o motle selemong sena.
Now the question is whether it can keep him.	Joale potso ke hore na e ka mo boloka.
One man was injured.	Monna e mong o ile a tsoa kotsi.
I have seen the things you have done.	Ke bone lintho tseo u li entseng.
I did not need to say that.	Ke ne ke sa hloke ho bua joalo.
I was very bad.	Ke ne ke le mpe haholo.
Neither could they.	Le bona ba ne ba ke ke ba khona.
I've seen what happens.	Ke bone se etsahalang.
It was a wonderful time.	E ne e le nako e monate haholo.
But you do not know your power.	Empa ha o tsebe matla a hao.
I don't see a problem with it.	Ha ke bone bothata ka eona.
It is true to.	Ke 'nete ho.
Now the car is moving smoothly.	Hona joale koloi e tsamaea hantle.
He returns home after a long absence.	O khutlela hae ka mor'a nako e telele a le sieo.
If you see it, take it.	Haeba u e bona, e nke.
That's just my style.	Eo ke mokhoa oa ka feela.
I did, too.	Ke entse, le nna.
I think we have a problem here.	Ke nahana hore re na le bothata mona.
I look forward to more.	Ke lebeletse ho feta.
Because she is so beautiful.	Hobane o motle joalo.
He did not even try to stop.	Ha a ka a leka le ho ema.
It can't go anywhere.	E ke ke ea ea kae kapa kae.
You found someone else.	U fumane motho e mong.
We too are human.	Le rona re batho.
You ask what you want to give up.	U botsa hore na u batla ho tlohela eng.
If it only works.	Haeba e sebetsa feela.
However, she never asked for help.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho mohla a kileng a kōpa thuso.
Some say that it is always there.	Ba bang ba re e teng ka linako tsohle.
This is an opportunity.	Ona ke monyetla.
He can come with me.	A ka tla le nna.
He graduated from high school.	O ile a qeta sekolong se phahameng.
It is not good to be present at this time.	Ha ho molemo ho ba teng nakong ena.
But after about a week it started to get easier.	Empa ka mor'a nako e ka etsang beke ho ile ha qala ho ba bonolo.
It was his car.	E ne e le koloi ea hae.
But maybe you don’t take it literally?	Empa mohlomong u se ke ua e nka ka tsela ea sebele?
If you were to come here, you would not see him.	Haeba u ne u ka tla mona, u ne u ke ke ua mo bona.
He will return.	O tla khutla.
He'll just stand there, without speaking.	O tla ema moo feela, ntle le ho bua.
But he could not refuse.	Empa o ne a sitoa ho hana.
Thank you so much !.	Ke leboha haholo!.
We have a lot of money.	Re na le chelete e ngata.
I am a boy.	Ke moshanyana.
I would not have done it without you.	Nka be ke sa e etsa ntle le uena.
I could not see them.	Ke ne ke sa ba bone.
This is certainly not the first time anyone has used it.	Ka sebele ha se lekhetlo la pele motho a e sebelisa.
But they can be better.	Empa ba ka ba betere.
This way, you only need to write them down once.	Ka tsela ena, o hloka feela ho li ngola hang feela.
And then his mind stays on it.	Ebe joale kelello ea hae e lula ho eona.
That was his thing.	Eo e ne e le ntho ya hae.
However, it was his only chance.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le monyetla oa hae feela.
This is very clear.	Sena se hlakile hantle.
Go back and do three.	Khutla 'me u etse tse tharo.
Your wife needs new clothes.	Mosali oa hau o hloka liaparo tse ncha.
I can stand.	Nka ema.
Look at your book.	Sheba buka ea hau.
The best player will get a job.	Sebapali se hloahloa se tla fumana mosebetsi.
Group of.	Sehlopha sa.
That's the way they talk.	Ke tsela eo ba buang ka eona.
You will have to do better than before.	U tla tlameha ho etsa betere ho feta pele.
It was a lifelong career.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa bophelo bohle.
I will try it again.	Ke tla e leka hape.
Very good for you.	E ntle haholo ho uena.
They tried to provide food.	Ba ile ba leka ho fana ka lijo.
Like me, today.	Jwalo ka nna, kajeno.
Of course, it really is.	Ha e le hantle, ho hlile ho joalo.
We will start at the end and then go back.	Re tla qala qetellong ebe re khutlela morao.
There were people.	Ho ne ho e-na le batho.
It was a pleasure to visit them.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba etela.
That is what he expected.	Ke sona seo a neng a se lebeletse.
I don't want to hear about it.	Ha ke batle ho utloa ka eona.
You ask us.	Ua re botsa.
They began to sing.	Ba ile ba qala ho bina.
It must be your decision.	E tlameha ebe ke qeto ea hao.
Never forget that.	O seke wa lebala seo le ka mohla.
Because we are not.	Hobane ha re joalo.
This is such a bad book.	Ena ke buka e mpe hakana.
I wondered how long it would take.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na ho tla nka nako e kae.
Now that's when we need them.	Joale ke ha re li hloka.
We did not know what happened to them.	Re ne re sa tsebe se etsahetseng ka bona.
This is even worse.	Sena se mpe le ho feta.
At some point.	Ka nako e itseng.
Looking at the past.	Ho sheba nako e fetileng.
It's not enough.	Ha ho so ka ho lekana.
I had to have someone.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho ba le motho.
We can trust.	Re ka tšepa.
You have to decide.	U tlameha ho etsa qeto.
She enjoyed watching him.	O ne a thabela ho mo sheba.
We are fine together.	Re hantle hammoho.
You may have seen it by now.	Mohlomong u se u kile ua bona hona joale.
You will not see or experience what is coming to you.	U ke ke ua bona kapa ua kopana le se tlang ho uena.
You say you can't get it.	U re u ke ke ua e fumana.
I have not done a good job like him.	Ha kea etsa mosebetsi o motle joalo ka eena.
You don't even know it.	Ha o tsebe le ho o tseba.
It's hard to hear, but it's important to hear.	Ho thata ho utloa, empa ho bohlokoa ho utloa.
For money.	Bakeng sa chelete.
The young man.	Mohlankana.
If there were any like him.	Hoja ho ne ho e-na le ba tšoanang le eena.
I could not stay.	nka be ke sa dula.
He dropped the subject.	O ile a tlohela taba.
Giving to friends and family is fun.	Ho fana ho metsoalle le ba lelapa ho monate.
Try to find a way forward.	Leka ho fumana tsela ea ho ea pele.
There is space, he says.	Sebaka se teng, o re.
The child seemed to know what he was doing.	Ngoana o ne a bonahala a tseba seo a se etsang.
We don't know it.	Ha re o tsebe.
I do not want to see what is there.	Ha ke batle ho bona se leng teng moo.
We are here to help!	Re teng ho thusa!.
You don’t think about anything else.	Ha o nahane ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Anyone can write and say anything about me.	Mang kapa mang a ka ngola mme a bua letho ka nna.
It says it's true.	E re e le 'nete.
Everyone at the party drank heavily.	E mong le e mong moketeng o ne a noa haholo.
That's the way it is with people.	Ke kamoo ho leng kateng ho batho.
He does other things first.	O etsa lintho tse ling pele.
In the past, he loved this house.	Khale, o ne a rata ntlo ena.
Please do not forget that.	Ke kopa o seke oa lebala seo.
I could see that when he was working.	Ke ne ke bona seo ha a sebetsa.
Moreover, we could not find it.	Ho feta moo, re ne re sa khone ho e fumana.
It was wet and soft.	E ne e le metsi mme e le bonolo.
That he knew her was a strange thing.	Hore ebe o ile a mo tseba e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
It's your job now.	Ke mosebetsi oa hau hona joale.
I can't find anything.	Ha ke fumane letho.
What is that?	Ke eng hoo?
They open the door.	Ba bula lemati.
You can watch it.	U ka e shebella.
We know.	Rea tseba.
As in the high school years.	Joalo ka lilemo tsa sekolo se phahameng.
When they come to us, we can talk to them.	Ha ba tla ho rona, re ka bua le bona.
You'll be back now, you hear?	U tla khutla hona joale, ua utloa?
If you say it often enough it must be true.	Haeba u e bua ka makhetlo a lekaneng e tlameha ebe ke 'nete.
Thanks for the help.	Ke leboha thuso.
I don't know, maybe it was the only thing he could do.	Ha ke tsebe, mohlomong e ne e le ntho feela eo a neng a ka e etsa.
But you can't finish dinner today.	Empa u ke ke ua qeta lijo tsa mantsiboea kajeno.
He will never do anything to you again.	Ha a sa tla hlola a o etsa letho.
He started the car.	A qala koloi.
He spent days with his doctor.	O ile a qeta matsatsi le ngaka ea hae.
But, he likes to talk a lot.	Empa, o rata ho bua haholo.
You go to it.	U ea ho eona.
You know, it's really fun this time.	Ua tseba, ho monate haholo nakong ena.
All.	Bohle.
I felt bad about that.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko ka seo.
I do not like him.	Ha ke mo rate.
He refused to come.	A hana ho tla.
It was their only chance.	E ne e le monyetla oa bona feela.
It really works well.	E hlile e sebetsa hantle.
He knew nothing about my pain.	O ne a sa tsebe letho ka bohloko ba ka.
They had no food.	Ba ne ba se na lijo.
I did not care about this.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle letho ho sena.
Please? 	Ka kopo?
I need you.	Kea u hloka.
We are already here.	Re se re le mona.
That treatment is no longer a good rule of thumb.	Ho tšoara hoo ha e sa le molao o motle.
Not everyone should do the same for the team.	Ha se bohle ba lokelang ho etsetsa sehlopha lintho tse tšoanang.
It was so beautiful.	E ne e le ntle haholo.
Nobody seemed to be talking about how to fix it.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se motho ea buang ka mokhoa oa ho e lokisa.
He said he was not sure.	A re ha a na bonnete.
No, sorry.	Che, masoabi.
Please let me know what you think.	Ke kopa ho tseba seo u se nahanang.
That's a very good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle haholo.
As this whole place does.	Joalo ka ha sebaka sena sohle se etsa.
We would be happy to help you.	Re ka thabela ho u thusa.
However, please read on.	Leha ho le joalo, ka kopo bala ho tsoela pele.
Everyone starts talking.	E mong le e mong o qala ho bua.
They should not know.	Ha ba a lokela ho tseba.
This is what you want.	Sena ke seo u se batlang.
I was unaware.	Ke ne ke sa hlokomela.
He was one of many others.	E ne e le e mong oa ba bang ba bangata.
It used ideas.	E ne e sebelisa maikutlo.
They had no one.	Ba ne ba se na e mong.
It was nice to be with him there.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba le eena moo.
He does not want to talk.	Ha a batle ho bua.
You know nothing.	Ha o tsebe letho.
Or, well.	Kapa, ​​hantle.
I have to live.	Ke tlameha ho phela.
The important thing is you.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke uena.
These are dangerous to me.	Tsena li kotsi ho 'na.
And you no longer expect it.	Mme ha o sa e lebella.
People used to come to my place and get food.	Batho ba ne ba tloaetse ho tla sebakeng sa ka 'me ba fumane lijo.
They used him, you know.	Ba ne ba mo sebelisa, oa tseba.
So she did not know what to do with her life.	Kahoo, o ne a sa tsebe hore na o tla etsa'ng ka bophelo ba hae.
He says something, he says something.	O bua ho hong, o bua ho hong.
That is simply true.	Eo ke 'nete feela.
I'm talking to myself.	Ke re bua le nna.
They are not happy, they cannot think.	Ha ba thabile, ha ba khone ho nahana.
Think that this is not true.	Nka hore sena hase 'nete.
I didn’t think there could be a risk of that here.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore ho ka ba le kotsi ea seo mona.
He then spoke of every opportunity.	Ka mor’a moo o ne a bua ka monyetla o mong le o mong.
I really didn't know what to expect then.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ho tla etsahala’ng ka nako eo.
You no longer need them.	Ha u sa li hloka.
I talked to him on the phone several times.	Ke ile ka bua le eena ka mohala ka makhetlo a ’maloa.
New and old.	E ncha le ea khale.
All the kids are so cute.	Bana bohle ba monate haholo.
He had to be absent.	O ne a tlameha ho se be teng.
It was sad, he thought.	E ne e le masoabi, a nahana.
And then you have to fix that.	Mme ebe o lokela ho lokisa tseo.
And that's how your child knows you.	'Me ke kamoo ngoana oa hau a u tsebang kateng.
I don't know when.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke neng.
But this is a mistake.	Empa sena ke phoso.
I believe this is the problem.	Ke lumela hore bothata ke bona.
I didn't know how to do it all the time.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ho e etsa ka linako tsohle.
You can see these here and there.	U ka bona tsena mona le mona.
Just a letter.	Lengolo feela.
Do not expect to buy right.	U se ke ua tšepa ho reka hantle.
It might not have been what he wanted, but he did do it anyway.	E ne e ka se be seo a neng a se batla, empa o ile a se etsa leha ho le joalo.
You will not even want to.	U ke ke ua ba ua batla.
What happened would never happen again.	Se etsahetseng se ne se ke ke sa hlola se etsahala.
He still has to get to work.	O ntse a tlameha ho kena mosebetsing.
There was something.	Ho ne ho e-na le ho hong.
He opened the heavy door.	A bula lemati le boima.
They made a suggestion.	Ba ile ba etsa tlhahiso.
I did not expect it to be so difficult today.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore kajeno ho tla ba thata hakana.
We went out for dinner.	Re ile ra tsoa bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I've never seen it.	Ha ke eso e bone.
We do not know what it can mean or what it is.	Ha re tsebe hore na e ka bolela eng kapa hore na ke eng.
I can hear it from him.	Eka utloa ho eena.
It was the first thing he said since they all arrived.	E ne e le ntho ea pele eo a ileng a e bua ho tloha ha bohle ba fihla.
And he had power.	Mme o ne a ena le matla.
However, this team plays very well.	Leha ho le joalo, sehlopha sena se bapala hantle haholo.
I was really not me.	Ke ne ke hlile ke se 'na.
They got the last one.	Ba fumane ea ho qetela.
It's not her fault.	Ha se molato wa hae.
Some were still alive.	Ba bang ba ne ba ntse ba phela.
It hurt all week.	E ile ea utloa bohloko beke kaofela.
Every week.	Beke e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
I'm too old to know it.	Ke moholo ho o tseba.
Yes, there are several of them.	E, ho na le tse ’maloa tsa tsona.
Some have it, some do not.	Ba bang ba na le eona, ba bang ha ba na eona.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
They just went out and did as they pleased.	Ba ile ba tsoa feela eaba ba etsa kamoo ba ratang kateng.
That is exactly what he expected.	E leng sona seo a neng a se lebeletse.
I'm not you.	Ha ke uena.
Of course they do.	Ehlile ba etsa joalo.
Our problems are relatively simple.	Mathata a rona a batla a le bonolo.
We will keep that.	Re tla boloka seo.
No, you do not have to work.	Che, ha ua tlameha ho sebetsa.
He asks good, difficult questions.	O botsa lipotso tse ntle, tse thata.
Then talk to her.	Ebe u bua le eena.
I was the only woman in the room.	E ne e le 'na feela mosali ka kamoreng.
For many years.	Ka lilemo tse ngata.
My group is empty right now.	Sehlopha sa ka ha se na letho hona joale.
It can be difficult.	Ho ka ba thata.
We were close.	Re ne re le haufi.
You can get to the whole place while you are there.	U ka khona ho fihla sebakeng sohle ha u le moo.
And before.	Le pele.
That is what we did.	Ke sona seo re ileng ra se etsa.
This is a very strange line.	Ena ke mohala o makatsang haholo.
They have to write something bad.	Ba tlameha ho ngola ntho e mpe.
I had seen this.	Ke ne ke bone sena.
I don't even see what it is.	Ha ke bone le hore na ke eng.
I love you so much.	Ke u rata haholo.
Also old-fashioned food.	Hape lijo tsa khale tsa khale.
Or rather.	Kapa ho e-na le hoo.
That was the only time.	Eo e ne e le eona feela nako.
You were where you wanted to be.	U ne u le moo u batlang.
He had more, too.	O ne a ena le ho feta, hape.
Save a few to save everything.	Boloka tse seng kae ho boloka tsohle.
I have to know.	Ke tlameha ho tseba.
I did not expect to be that person.	Ha kea lebella ho ba motho eo.
The first time was this week.	Lekhetlo la pele le ne le le teng bekeng ena.
In place of.	Sebakeng sa .
Nothing happens.	Haho letho le etsahalang.
Everyone was human.	E mong le e mong e ne e le motho.
That is what my husband really wanted.	Ke sona seo monna oa ka a neng a hlile a se batla.
I just don't want them around.	Ke mpa ke sa batle hore ba be haufi le nna.
It was what he eventually needed most.	E ne e le seo qetellong a neng a se hloka haholo.
He wrote about it shortly thereafter.	O ile a ngola ka eona hang ka mor'a moo.
I'll get back to it.	Ke tla khutlela ho eona.
He will never do this again.	A ke ke a hlola a etsa sena.
I can't imagine.	Ha ke khone ho nahana.
I had a bad day.	Ke bile le letsatsi le bohloko.
That would have been better.	Hoo ho ka be ho bile molemo.
We will keep it.	Re tla e boloka.
However, I am not sure what it is.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke eng.
And why they don't.	Le hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba sa etse joalo.
The picture caught our attention.	Setšoantšo se ile sa re tšoara.
Check this out.	Sheba sena.
And sometimes you have to find the things you need.	'Me ka linako tse ling u tlameha ho fumana lintho tseo u li hlokang.
We must trust.	Re tlameha ho tšepa.
We should try something like this.	Re lokela ho leka ntho e kang ena.
No one has that kind of power.	Ha ho motho ea nang le matla a mofuta oo.
And that's what it is.	Mme ke sona seo e leng sona.
I may or may not agree.	Nka lumela kapa ke se ke ka lumela.
Keep up the good work.	Tsoela pele ka mosebetsi o makatsang.
Then we left.	Eaba rea ​​tsamaea.
And she gets it.	Mme o a e fumana.
He does nothing.	Ha a etse letho.
Something is happening.	Ho na le ntho e etsahalang.
But it is not that simple.	Empa ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
I'm not sure what I would think of that opening.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka nahana eng ka ho bula hoo.
I felt very alone.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke le mong haholo.
The fact is, you like it.	'Nete ke hore oa e rata.
Then he came out.	Eaba oa tsoa.
And so you should.	Mme ka hona o lokela.
But he forgot the name.	Empa o ile a lebala lebitso leo.
He came out.	O ile a tsoa.
Do what you love about this.	Etsa seo u se ratang ka sena.
It was great to help you too.	Ho bile monate ho o thusa hape.
I did not get that.	Ha kea ka ka fumana seo.
We can use a lot of information.	Re ka sebelisa litaba tse ngata.
No one could stop us from going so fast.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a ka etsa hore re tsamaee kapele hakaalo.
Life is meaningless.	Bophelo bo se na thuso.
I have nothing.	Ha ke na letho.
However, he was lifeless.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a se na bophelo.
I did not want to stop.	Ke ne ke se ke sa batle ho ema.
I was crying.	Ke ne ke lla.
So the picture went.	Kahoo setšoantšo se ile sa tsamaea.
But we believe this is a good thing.	Empa re lumela hore sena ke ntho e ntle.
He just wants you to take him.	O batla hore o mo nke feela.
We could not do it without them.	Re ne re ke ke ra e etsa ntle le bona.
Dad gets it.	Ntate oa fumana.
He knew there was something but he didn't know what it was.	O ne a tseba hore ho na le ho hong empa a sa tsebe hore na ke eng.
But no one took it all from me so much.	Empa ha ho motho ea ileng a nka ho 'na kaofela hakana.
This will not happen.	Sena se ke ke sa etsahala.
He was used to this.	O ne a tloaetse sena.
There are books on that.	Ho na le libuka tse buang ka seo.
Maybe sometime.	Mohlomong ka nako e 'ngoe.
That's where you have to be.	Ke hona moo o lokelang ho ba teng.
You have to move on if you can.	U tlameha ho ea pele ha u khona.
It took a long time.	O ile a nka nako e telele.
Everyone loves it !.	E mong le e mong oa e rata!.
That goes on.	Seo se ntse se tsoela pele.
I usually don't care.	Hangata ha ke tsotelle seo.
I should not say it.	Ha kea lokela ho e bua.
No one did.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a etsa joalo.
Start talking to the area around your child.	Qala ho bua le sebaka se haufi le ngoana oa hau.
But if we do this, they will win.	Empa haeba re etsa ntho ena, ba tla hlola.
I asked her if she loved him very much.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na o ne a mo rata haholo.
And it will always be so with us.	Mme ho tla ba jwalo kamehla le rona.
We never beat them.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra ba hlola.
He read about other problems.	O ile a bala ka mathata a mang.
This is a difficult one.	Ena ke e thata.
No, he thought.	Che, o ile a nahana.
All he wanted at that moment was to get back to you.	Sohle seo a neng a se batla ka nako eo kaofela ke ho khutlela ho uena.
It was a good idea.	E ne e bile mohopolo o motle.
Some people come in and stay.	Batho ba bang ba kena 'me ba lula.
It is not necessary now.	Ha ho hlokahale hona joale.
However, her parents seemed very nice.	Leha ho le joalo, batsoali ba hae ba ne ba bonahala ba le motle haholo.
Having his own money.	Ho ba le chelete ea hae.
This is very easy to do.	Sena se bonolo haholo ho se etsa.
He opened the door and went inside.	A bula lemati a kena.
He passed.	A feta.
But nobody says anything.	Empa ha ho motho ea buang letho.
This is the first of its kind.	Ena ke ea pele ea ho feta.
He says he was great.	O re o ne a le moholo.
But it seemed so before.	Empa ho ne ho bonahala ho le joalo pele.
Why he did not, is hard to say.	Ke hobane'ng ha a sa ka a etsa joalo, ho thata ho bolela.
I have many things for you today.	Ke na le lintho tse ngata bakeng sa hau kajeno.
She has.	O na le.
He was not eating breakfast.	O ne a sa je lijo tsa hoseng.
I will give good, bad, and bad.	Ke tla fana ka tse ntle, tse mpe, le tse mpe.
Leave it all.	Tlohela tsohle.
He loved the picture.	O ne a rata setšoantšo.
This will be a real thing.	Sena e tla ba ntho ea 'nete.
People were walking.	Batho ba ne ba tsamaea.
How do you do this?	U etsa see joang?
Why is that.	Hobaneng ho le joalo.
It is becoming more and more apparent.	E ntse e bonahala haholoanyane.
Not next week.	Ha ho bekeng e tlang.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
If you are tired, you need to sleep.	Haeba u khathetse, u lokela ho robala.
We would love to know.	Re ka thabela ho tseba.
It starts with me.	Ho qala ka nna.
He is from.	O tsoa ho.
Why could he do that.	Hobaneng a ne a ka etsa joalo.
I still am.	Ke ntse ke le joalo.
But it was still not enough.	Empa ho ne ho ntse ho sa lekana.
I don't want to see anything.	Ha ke batle ho bona letho.
He continues to study me.	O tsoela pele ho ithuta 'na.
You have to try it sometime.	U tlameha ho e leka ka nako e 'ngoe.
But that doesn't necessarily mean it's good.	Empa seo ha se hakaalo hore se molemo.
Maybe this will fix the problem.	Mohlomong sena se tla lokisa bothata.
I am very happy with it.	Ke thabile haholo ka eona.
I think it must be your relative.	Ke nahana hore e tlameha ebe ke mong ka uena.
So no one realized that he could know everything.	Kahoo ha ho motho ea ileng a hlokomela hore o ne a ka tseba lintho tsohle.
And, of course, maybe the room is empty.	'Me, ehlile, mohlomong kamore ha e na letho.
I asked him about many people.	Ke ile ka mo botsa ka batho ba bangata.
Just tell us when you want to go.	Re bolelle feela hore na u batla ho tsamaea neng.
I can't keep it.	Ha ke khone ho e boloka.
I'll tell you that.	Ke tla o bolella seo.
In a way he did not expect.	Ka tsela eo a neng a sa e lebella.
It is very easy to work with.	Ho bonolo haholo ho sebetsa le.
I don't see one you can say.	Ha ke bone e 'ngoe eo u ka e buang.
You're just trying to live a certain way.	U mpa u leka ho phela ka mokhoa o itseng.
That is yet to come.	Seo se sa ntse se tla etsahala.
If you can try it, it's good.	Ha o ka e leka, e ntle.
You have to be strong for what you are.	U tlameha ho ba matla ho seo u leng sona.
He was glad he asked.	O ne a thabetse hore ebe o ile a botsa.
He knew it was time, and the day was coming.	O ne a tseba hore ke nako, le hore letsatsi le a tla.
Note that we both win in any way.	Hlokomela hore ka bobeli re hlola ka tsela efe kapa efe.
There is one thing.	Ho na le ntho e le 'ngoe.
Meet people.	Kopana le batho.
Nice to hear from you.	Ho monate ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
That was the worst thing.	Eo e ne e le ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
His feet were bare.	Maoto a hae a ne a le feela.
I just don't know.	Ke mpa ke sa tsebe.
But that is all in the past.	Empa seo sohle se nakong e fetileng.
Also, know when to be present when you are first.	Hape, ho tseba nako ea ho ba teng ha u le pele.
They met for the first time.	Ba ile ba kopana lekhetlo la pele.
It was fun for them.	Ho ne ho le monate ho bona.
Neither can you.	Le uena u ke ke ua etsa joalo.
Don't tell me.	U se ke ua mpolella.
Long way out.	Tsela e telele ea ho tsoa.
I'm usually done.	Hangata ke qetile.
Tell them you did what they said.	Ba bolelle hore u entse seo ba se buileng.
So, the same thing with water.	Kahoo, ntho e tšoanang ka metsi.
There was no way to say it.	Ho ne ho se mokhoa oa ho li bua.
For me it was a life school.	Ho 'na e ne e le sekolo sa bophelo.
It, too, is too long.	Le eona, e telele haholo.
Most people would do the same.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba tla etsa joalo.
They will speak up and hope it will happen.	Ba tla bua 'me ba tšepa hore ho tla etsahala.
I love her so much that she also makes me love everything.	Ke mo rata hoo le eena a etsang hore ke rate ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
Your friends and family will notice, but you may not.	Metsoalle ea hau le ba lelapa ba tla hlokomela, empa u ka 'na ua se ke ua hlokomela.
But nothing like that is happening right now.	Empa ha ho letho le kang le etsahalang hona joale.
My time off was important.	Nako ea ka ea ho se be teng e ne e le ea bohlokoa.
The day after tomorrow.	Letsatsi ka morao ho hosane.
We hope you enjoy reading their articles.	Re tšepa hore u tla thabela ho bala litaba tsa bona.
They will know soon.	Ba tla tseba haufinyane.
It would not be right.	E ne e ka se be hantle.
Not a good thing.	Ha se ntho e ntle.
Probably not necessary.	Mohlomong ha ho hlokahale.
He didn't even want to think about her.	O ne a sa batle le ho nahana ka eena.
They don't care.	Ha ba tsotelle.
Some require you to get them in advance.	Tse ling li hloka hore u li fumane esale pele.
Good job if you can get it.	Mosebetsi o motle ha o ka o fumana.
And it's beautiful.	Mme e ntle.
So far we know, there is no other.	Ho fihlela joale re tseba, ha ho le e 'ngoe e teng.
I think we just had to say something about ourselves.	Ke nahana hore re ne re tlameha feela ho bua ho hong ka rōna.
They have finished the work.	Ba qetile mosebetsi.
This process would continue to happen.	Mokhoa ona o ne o tla tsoela pele ho etsahala.
But he kept asking questions.	Empa o ile a tsoela pele ho botsa lipotso.
The issue itself is somehow second.	Taba ka bo eona ka tsela e itseng ke ea bobeli.
It is truly a wonderful time.	Ruri ke nako e monate.
Exactly so.	Hantle joalo.
We will not do such a thing.	Re ke ke ra etsa letho le joalo.
There would be no time to get out.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha ba le nako ea ho tsoa.
As they were.	Joalo ka ha ba bile.
But this was not a school.	Empa sena e ne e se sekolo.
It was an old car.	E ne e le koloi ea khale.
We will do our best to help you.	Re tla etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang ho u thusa.
The boy was mine.	Moshanyana e ne e le wa ka.
This can be good for that.	Sena se ka ba molemo ho seo.
Then the hard work begins.	Ebe joale mosebetsi o boima oa qala.
I did not start it.	Ha kea e qala.
Your children win.	Bana ba hao ba a hlola.
This means that.	Sena se bolela hore.
She was crying.	O ne a lla.
I have had this problem before.	Ke kile ka ba le bothata bona.
So why did you do that? 	Joale ke hobane'ng ha u entse joalo?
What would be his decision?	Qeto ea hae e ne e tla ba efe?
asked the boy.	ha botsa moshanyana.
Make writing simple and easy.	Etsa hore ho ngola litaba ho be bonolo hape ho be bonolo.
I don't have to read it.	Ha kea tlameha ho e bala.
And he did so.	Mme a etsa seo.
They don't even know he's here.	Ha ba tsebe le hore o teng mona.
That's all.	Ke tsohle.
Be on time regularly.	Eba ka nako kamehla.
Of course, the same is true for me.	Ka 'nete, ho joalo ho 'na.
It may or may not be.	Ho ka ba joalo, kapa ho se be joalo.
They had such power.	Ba ne ba e-na le matla a joalo.
When my parents died, they became my father and mother to me.	Ha batsoali ba ka ba hlokahala, e ile ea e-ba ntate le ’mè ho ’na.
There are several of your friends in the background.	Ho na le metsoalle ea hau e 'maloa ka morao.
This is still the case.	Sena se ntse se le joalo.
And many people did.	Mme batho ba bangata ba ile ba etsa jwalo.
Maybe it was then.	Mohlomong e ne e le ka nako eo.
Everyone uses him.	E mong le e mong oa mo sebelisa.
But it keeps going.	Empa e tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
There is such a thing as a very old group.	Ho na le ntho e kang sehlopha sa khale haholo.
That's not me.	Ha se 'na eo.
He wished he could do that.	O ne a lakatsa eka a ka etsa joalo.
Here they do not know.	Mona ha ba tsebe.
No, that is not the case.	Che, ha se taba eo.
This really happens a lot.	Sena se hlile se etsahala haholo.
And he can understand this.	'Me a ka utloisisa sena.
But you can't write anything about our lives.	Empa u ke ke ua ngola letho ka bophelo ba rona.
That's the point.	Ke taba.
She buys several of her clothes there.	O reka liaparo tsa hae tse 'maloa moo.
To treat his age well.	Ho tšoara lilemo tsa hae hantle.
Time had been good for her husband.	Nako e ne e bile molemo ho monna oa hae.
Maybe that's what happened here.	Mohlomong ke sona se etsahetseng mona.
The same is true of this.	Ho joalo le ka sena.
That's not something I can say.	Ha se taba eo nka e buang.
I wanted to believe that.	Ke ne ke batla ho lumela joalo.
They planned it only when they were arrested.	Ba ne ba e rera feela ha ba tšoaroa.
And so it becomes very simple.	'Me kahoo e ba bonolo haholo.
Last year, they tried other foods as well.	Selemong se fetileng, ba ile ba leka lijo tse ling hape.
You can say nothing.	O ka se bue letho.
He is one of them.	Ke e mong oa bona.
You can say they are yours.	O ka re ke tsa hao.
Let him do what he wants.	A etse seo a se batlang.
I almost can't believe it's going to happen.	Ke batla ke sa lumele hantle hore e tla etsahala.
That girl is beautiful.	Ngoanana eo o motle.
When and where would they eat?	Ba ne ba tla ja neng hona hokae.
And there is still nothing.	Mme ho ntse ho se letho.
To hear it all, and to do nothing.	Ho utloa tsohle, le ho se etse letho.
That's up to you.	Seo se ho uena.
Lots of things, lots of things.	Lintho tse ngata, tse ngata.
He felt like a child.	O ne a ikutloa joaloka ngoana.
Which is what happened.	E leng se ileng sa etsahala.
I'm fine.	kea phela.
Just one of many.	E 'ngoe feela ea tse ngata.
Of course not.	Ehlile ha se ea ka.
But still he spoke.	Empa leha ho le joalo o ile a bua.
Lots to read.	Tse ngata tsa ho bala.
I should have known she would think so.	Ke ne ke lokela ho tseba hore o tla nahana joalo.
However, I think this is a very good thing.	Leha ho le joalo, ke nahana hore ena ke ntho e molemo haholo.
We no longer need it.	Ha re sa e hloka.
It was nice to be around him to the end.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba haufi le eena ho fihlela qetellong.
The ones here are there.	Ba teng mona ba teng.
Go to bed early tonight.	Robala kapele bosiung bona.
His father was just a job.	Ntate oa hae e ne e le mosebetsi feela.
No one asked questions.	Ha ho ea ileng a botsa lipotso.
Finally, it was time to return home.	Qetellong, e ne e le nako ea ho khutlela hae.
This was his last job.	Ena e ne e le mosebetsi oa hae oa ho qetela.
I really wanted to say thank you.	Ke ne ke hlile ke batla ho leboha.
He was absent yesterday.	O ne a le sieo maobane.
It's easy for us obviously.	Ho bonolo ho rona ho hlakile.
You will not be able to reach him.	U ke ke ua khona ho fihla ho eena.
It will be out tomorrow.	E tla tsoa hosane.
It is not a good opportunity.	Ha se monyetla o motle.
He lived for only a few years after that.	O ile a phela lilemo tse 'maloa feela ka mor'a moo.
We don't have to talk any more.	Ha re a tlameha ho bua ho feta moo.
But the picture.	Empa setšoantšo.
Take it if you have it.	E nke haeba u e-na le eona.
He does not know them.	Ha a ba tsebe.
As a result, we decided he had to learn to swim.	Ka lebaka leo, re ile ra etsa qeto ea hore o lokela ho ithuta ho sesa.
That's not the way he went on.	Ha se tsela eo o ileng oa tsoela pele ka eona.
And it worked.	'Me ea sebetsa.

Now we need to get dinner.	Joale re hloka ho fumana lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I don't know why this is happening.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hobaneng sena se etsahala.
Whatever it is.	Eng kapa eng e teng.
Understand their weight.	Utloisisa boima ba tsona.
I did not like his name.	Ke ne ke sa rate lebitso la hae.
Then start working with them regularly.	Ebe u qala ho sebetsa le bona kamehla.
It was not her business then, unless she called him again.	E ne e se taba ea hae joale, ntle le haeba a mo letsetsa hape.
I got to know him very well.	Ke ile ka mo tseba haholo.
It was time for me to go too.	E ne e le nako ea hore le 'na ke tsamaee.
Continue to see what we think about it.	Tsoela pele ho bona seo re se nahanang ka eona.
It's just fun to talk about.	Ho monate feela ho bua.
None of us knew what to do about it.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a tseba hore na a etse eng ka hona.
That's my opinion.	Ke maikutlo a ka.
But he was needed.	Empa o ne a hlokahala.
There will be no reading or writing.	Ha ho na ho bala kapa ho ngola.
I'll stop and see what happens.	Ke tla ema ke bone se etsahalang.
What can you see there? 	U ka bona eng moo?
But nothing worked.	Empa ha ho letho le ileng la etsa.
he asked.	a botsa.
The power is there.	Matla a teng.
He had a problem.	O ne a na le bothata.
We have to move fast.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea kapele.
He wanted real life.	O ne a batla bophelo ba sebele.
However, there will be problems during the day.	Leha ho le joalo, ho tla ba le mathata nakong ea letsatsi.
We are still trying out a few things.	Re ntse re leka lintho tse 'maloa.
But he could not do it.	Empa o ne a sa khone ho e etsa.
We went in and the team was very nice.	Re ile ra kena 'me sehlopha se ne se le setle haholo.
And maybe not.	'Me mohlomong ha ho joalo.
You know what's going to happen.	U tseba se tla etsahala.
She did all she could for the child.	O ile a etsetsa ngoana sohle seo a ka se khonang.
No, time does not go by, right.	Che, nako ha e tsamaee, hantle.
That means they can't work full time.	Seo se bolela hore ha ba khone ho sebetsa ka nako eohle.
I have to read some things.	Ke tlameha ho bala lintho tse ling.
Apparently he visited her often.	Ho bonahala eka o ile a mo etela hangata.
Everyone is clear.	E mong le e mong o hlakile.
In fact, it happened every time he went into the room with her.	Ka 'nete, ho ne ho etsahala nako le nako ha a kena ka kamoreng le eena.
I want to help with your book.	Ke batla ho thusa ka buka ea hau.
It happens, you know.	Hoa etsahala, ua tseba.
A very tasty dinner, too.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea tse monate haholo, hape.
You can almost see it.	O ka batla o e bona.
You may have a mental illness.	E ka ’na eaba o na le mathata a kelello.
And you see that.	Mme o bona seo.
You have to try.	U tlameha ho leka.
I always think about this really.	Ke lula ke nahana ka sena ehlile.
They watched for hours.	Ba ile ba shebella lihora tse ngata.
He was tired and wanted to sleep.	O ne a khathetse 'me a batla ho robala.
Did you hear something weird last night?	A na u utloile ntho e makatsang bosiung bo fetileng?
This is difficult for most people.	Sena se thata ho batho ba bangata.
Neither do they.	Le bona ha ba etse joalo.
My working time.	Nako ea ka ea ho sebetsa.
So you do not have to do it.	Kahoo ha ho hlokahale hore u e etse.
It is not.	Ha se.
The way his emotions lived.	Tsela eo maikutlo a hae a ileng a phela ka eona.
Keep up the good work.	Tsoela pele ka mosebetsi o motle.
You want to forget now.	O batla ho lebala jwale.
I wish they wouldn’t do that.	Ke lakatsa eka ba ke ke ba etsa joalo.
But it did not work.	Empa ha ea ka ea sebetsa.
He made money last year.	O entse chelete selemong se fetileng.
Look at the picture here.	Sheba setšoantšo mona.
I want to love this.	Ke batla ho rata sena.
Only one way to know.	Mokhoa o le mong feela oa ho tseba.
They make a person speak.	Ba etsa hore motho a bue.
We did this.	Sena re se entse.
It seems real.	Eka ke ea 'nete.
But notice he did.	Empa hlokomela o ile a etsa jwalo.
There is more to it than that.	Ho na le ho feta moo.
I have never tried such a hard book.	Ha kea ka ka leka ho leka buka e thata joalo.
If he says nothing, it is best to find a way to do it.	Haeba a sa re letho, ho molemo hore o fumane seo o ka se etsang.
It does not care in any way.	Ha e tsotelle ka tsela efe kapa efe.
It is good for them as well as for themselves.	Se molemo ho bona hammoho le bona.
That makes you understand.	Seo sea u utloisisa.
It has been for years.	E bile ka lilemo.
He wants to stay in the team.	O batla ho lula sehlopheng.
He said he did not know why he did so.	O ile a re ha a tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a entse joalo.
I just fell in love with him.	Ke ile ka mo rata feela.
Who knows where it was yesterday.	Ke mang ea tsebang moo e neng e le teng maobane.
You're good to me, you know.	U molemo ho 'na, ua tseba.
Try some of them.	Leka tse ling tsa tsona.
Yet problems remain.	Leha ho le joalo mathata a ntse a le teng.
He gives us a group.	O re fa sehlopha.
He gets it.	O a e fumana.
He said nothing to them.	Ha a ka a bua letho ho bona.
I know all this.	Ke tseba tsena tsohle.
But taking this picture was not an easy task.	Empa ho nka setšoantšo sena e ne e se mosebetsi o bonolo.
One person did not say where they lived.	Motho a le mong ha aa ka a bolela hore na ba lula hokae.
Here the father did not pay for child care.	Mona ntate ha a ka a lefa chelete ea ho hlokomela ngoana.
Think about the problem.	Nahana ka bothata.
It was yes or no.	E ne e le e kapa che.
I see it in the past.	Ke bona nakong e fetileng.
And another teacher.	Le tichere e 'ngoe.
We hope you will try it out.	Re tšepa hore u tla e leka.
No one ever told me.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a mpolella.
So it just goes on and on.	Kahoo e tsoela pele feela.
She wanted to cry but could not.	O ne a batla ho lla empa a sitoa.
They like to say this.	Ba rata ho bua sena.
Besides, you are one of a kind.	Ntle ho moo, u e mong oa mofuta.
They will pass if you allow them.	Li tla feta ha u li lumella.
I want you to have the best of everything.	Ke batla hore o be le tse molemo ka ho fetisisa ho tsohle.
We want them to love us.	Re batla hore ba re rate.
Finally he left.	Qetellong o ne a tsamaea.
We will talk to him if we can.	Re tla bua le eena ha re khona.
A man needs money to travel.	Monna o hloka chelete ea ho tsamaea.
I did not expect that.	Ke ne ke sa lebella seo.
Maybe again.	Mohlomong hape.
I have no friends.	Ha ke na metsoalle.
This car was easier than mine.	Koloi ena e ne e le bonolo ho feta ea ka.
He drinks a lot.	O noa haholo.
I am the one you have to have.	Ke 'na eo u lokelang ho ba le eena.
Not everyone thinks this is a good idea.	Ha se bohle ba nahanang hore ona ke mohopolo o motle.
It is very powerful.	E matla haholo.
However, these kept coming.	Leha ho le joalo, tsena li ile tsa ’na tsa tla.
I had hair at the time.	Ke ne ke e-na le moriri ka nako eo.
He spoke at length.	O ile a bua nako e telele.
That's what he does.	Ke seo a se etsang.
We loved them.	Re ne re ba rata.
The team does nothing.	Sehlopha ha se etse letho.
No one else should know.	Ha ho motho e mong ea lokelang ho tseba.
I had no idea what had happened.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe se etsahetseng.
You know about it, even though you do not think you know it.	U tseba ka eona, le hoja u sa nahane hore ua e tseba.
I'm much better now.	Ke betere haholo hona joale.
Why not?	Hobaneng ho se joalo?
Good stuff.	Lintho tse ntle.
Well for me.	Hantle ho nna.
No one needs such money.	Ha ho motho ea hlokang chelete e joalo.
And she came to life.	Mme a phela.
It was something they could not even imagine.	E ne e le ntho eo ba neng ba sa khone le ho e nahana.
Why you can think of anything else.	Hobaneng u ka nahana eng kapa eng e 'ngoe.
Lots of money.	Chelete e ngata.
Many think these are irrelevant, many think they are.	Ba bangata ba nahana hore tsena ha li na taba, ba bangata ba nahana hore li joalo.
But things are not that simple.	Empa lintho ha li bonolo hakaalo.
However, it is all yours.	Leha ho le joalo, ke oa hao kaofela.
That's where it was at.	Ke eo moo e neng e le teng.
There should be no school today.	Ha ho a tlameha ho ba le sekolo kajeno.
It can save real time.	E ka boloka nako ea sebele.
You are my problem.	U bothata ba ka.
Some have both.	Ba bang ba na le bobeli.
No one else could understand him for the rest of his life.	Ha ho motho e mong ea neng a ka mo utloisisa bophelo bohle ba hae.
It will be here.	E tla ba mona.
Questions remain.	Lipotso li ntse li le teng.
He wondered about the family.	A ipotsa ka lelapa.
You just think you hurt.	U nahana feela hore u utloile bohloko.
Then talk about good things.	Joale bua ka lintho tse ntle.
And that's a bad thing.	Mme ke ntho e mpe eo.
I did not want to live without her.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho phela ntle le eena.
Think carefully about what you will do.	Nahana ka hloko ka seo u tla se etsa.
That can be a real pain.	Seo e ka ba bohloko ba sebele.
He just wanted food.	O ne a batla lijo feela.
This is a very sad situation.	Bona ke boemo bo bohloko haholo.
I found it fun.	Ke ile ka e fumana e le monate.
And it is not easy.	Mme ha ho bonolo.
But that was not the case.	Empa ho ne ho se joalo.
That's the way he could be sometimes.	Ke kamoo a neng a ka ba kateng ka linako tse ling.
There was nothing wrong with her, but this room was old.	Ho ne ho se na phoso ea hae, empa kamore ena e ne e le ea khale.
he asked.	a botsa.
So that was all.	Kahoo e ne e le tsohle.
That's exactly what happened.	Ke hantle haholo se etsahetseng.
No one will pass this way.	Ha ho motho ea tla feta ka tsela ena.
He was still thinking hard.	O ne a ntse a nahana ka thata.
I think it must be their time.	Ke nahana hore e tlameha ebe ke nako ea bona.
But it’s not nearly as fun.	Empa ha e batla e le monate.
This may be the last water that will be available.	Ena e ka 'na ea e-ba metsi a ho qetela a tla ba teng.
You have to take care of them and watch them.	U tlameha ho ba hlokomela le ho ba shebella.
First of all, walking will be very helpful.	Taba ea pele, ho tsamaea ho tla thusa haholo.
If any.	Haeba e teng.
He was thirty.	O ne a le mashome a mararo.
Grab one and you will know what to do.	Tšoara e le 'ngoe 'me u tla tseba seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
Until then.	Ho fihlela ho bile jwalo.
You have to stop.	U tlameha ho ema.
It certainly seems to be true.	Ka sebele ho bonahala eka e ka ba 'nete.
He told us.	O ile a re bolella.
Almost everyone.	E batla e le motho e mong le e mong.
I don't care which way they go.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na ba tsamaea ka tsela efe.
They have to know what is going on.	Ba tlameha ho tseba se etsahalang.
We knew it would not be easy.	Re ne re tseba hore ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
We never thought of another idea.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra nahana ka mohopolo o mong.
He's just trying to help.	O mpa a leka ho thusa.
Bad and good.	E mpe le e ntle.
You have to be able to see through it.	U tlameha ho khona ho bona ka eona.
It was a strange feeling.	E ne e le maikutlo a makatsang.
As long as you eat and sleep well.	Ha feela o ntse o ja le ho robala ka ho lekaneng.
And now it was there.	Mme jwale e ne e le teng.
So they agree.	Kahoo baa lumela.
All the children were there.	Bana bohle ba ne ba le teng.
Yet it was him.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e le eena.
I felt very happy.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke thabile haholo.
We've been here before.	Re bile mona pele.
It was useless.	Ho ne ho se na thuso.
I'm not sure how important it is.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore na e bohlokoa hakae.
And we have work to do.	Mme re na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa.
This will be a problem.	Sena e tla ba bothata.
It probably won't be as hard as they think.	Mohlomong ho ke ke ha ba thata joalo ka ha ba nahana.
However, it is important.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bohlokoa.
And so he had an idea.	'Me kahoo o ne a e-na le maikutlo.
This is a problem.	Bona ke bothata.
Besides, this was a difficult time.	Ntle le moo, ena e ne e le nako e thata.
It was not there.	Ho ne ho se moo.
Those are good things.	Ke lintho tse ntle tseo.
And it was empty.	'Me e ne e se na letho.
I try very hard.	Ke leka ka matla.
I would have said 'no' to him.	Nka be ke ile ka re 'che' ho eena.
Maybe they could help.	Mohlomong ba ne ba ka thusa.
Love the other.	Rata e mong.
It doesn't matter to me, of course.	Ha ho na taba ea ka, ehlile.
I asked him to think about what it was.	Ke ile ka mo kopa hore a nahane hore na ke eng.
The doctor says she feels better.	Ngaka e re o ikutloa a le betere.
I agreed to do so.	Ke ile ka lumela ho etsa joalo.
I did not want to spend the whole night there.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho qeta bosiu bohle moo.
It was very important that I did not understand.	Ho ne ho le bohlokoa haholo hore ke se ke ka utloisisa.
I'm getting to know him.	Ke qala ho mo tseba.
There can be no one.	Ho ka se be le e mong.
Some like this thank you.	Tse ling tse kang tsena kea leboha.
The more you know, the easier it becomes.	Ha u ntse u tseba haholoanyane, ho ba bonolo haholoanyane.
At one point it seemed indifferent.	Ka lekhetlo le leng ho ne ho bonahala ho se na taba.
Yet he knows he has to stay home.	Leha ho le joalo oa tseba hore o lokela ho lula hae.
He does not have much money.	Ha a na chelete e ngata.
I say yes to everything.	Ke re e ho tsohle.
Now she knew how much she loved him.	Joale o ne a tseba kamoo a mo ratang kateng.
The children were playing.	Bana ba ne ba bapala.
I had to work.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho sebetsa.
I thought he was very happy.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o ne a thabile haholo.
There was space too.	Ho ne ho ena le sebaka hape.
I think after this past week even though it finally has.	Ke nahana ka mor'a beke ena e fetileng le hoja qetellong e na le.
When he looks, he can win when he leaves.	Ha a shebahala, a ka e hlola ha a tloha.
I'm trying to find another job.	Ke leka ho fumana mosebetsi o mong.
It was not night.	Ho ne ho se bosiu.
I said we would be done with.	Ke ne ke re re tla be re qetile ka .
You do not even know him.	Ha le mo tsebe le ho mo tseba.
That's not wrong.	Seo ha se phoso.
You have what you want.	U na le seo u se batlang.
It's really fun.	E monate ruri.
Water is essential for life.	Metsi a bohlokoa bakeng sa bophelo.
It's a beautiful picture.	Ke setšoantšo se setle.
We need to get out of here, from here.	Re hloka ho tloha mona, ho tloha mona.
It takes a person's life.	Ho nka bophelo ba motho.
He has been very good to me.	O bile molemo haholo ho nna.
Now, you're really going to say that.	Jwale, ehlile o ya bolela seo.
Some people have done it in the past.	Batho ba bang ba e entse nakong e fetileng.
I hope we play a lot.	Ke tšepa hore re tla bapala haholo.
I will never read that again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke bala seo.
My approach would be bad.	Mokhoa oa ka o ne o ka ba mpe.
However, this is not the case here.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo mona.
As you live.	Joalo ka ha u phela.
Of course we would not have been there.	Ehlile re ka be re sa ka ra ba teng.
Reading a book we will probably need a few days.	Ho bala buka mohlomong re tla hloka matsatsi a 'maloa.
I am sure we will all know soon.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore bohle re tla tseba haufinyane.
That's very important, you know.	Seo se bohlokoa haholo, ua tseba.
I will not go with him.	Nke ke ka tsamaea le eena.
Look, you're all together, boy.	Sheba, o kopane kaofela, moshanyana.
You have to do something.	O lokela ho etsa ho hong.
It will come whenever the time comes.	E tla tla neng kapa neng ha nako e fihla.
I want to come next time.	Ke batla ho tla nakong e tlang.
Yes! 	Ee!
I hope you can.	Ke tšepa hore u ka khona.
Why is this happening.	Hobaneng sena se etsahala.
And that is not fun.	Mme seo ha se monate.
I think he was the man everyone was looking at.	Ke nahana hore e ne e le monna eo bohle ba neng ba mo sheba.
However, it was a wonderful life.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le bophelo bo monate.
So he could go.	Kahoo o ne a ka ea.
There was that opportunity.	Ho ne ho e-na le monyetla oo.
It was not the life you had hoped for.	E ne e se bophelo boo o neng o bo lebeletse.
If you ever get the chance to do so you should do it.	Haeba u ka fumana monyetla oa ho etsa joalo u lokela ho etsa joalo.
He had found.	O ne a fumane.
You need to know more than that.	O lokela ho tseba betere ho feta moo.
Our team did not make a mistake.	Sehlopha sa rona ha sea ka sa etsa phoso.
I was there for three hours or more.	Ke ne ke le teng lihora tse tharo kapa ho feta moo.
I know, sorry.	Kea tseba, masoabi.
However, you may have just asked a question in a negative way.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong u sa tsoa botsa potso ka tsela e mpe.
He should pay his debt.	O lokela ho lefa molato oa hae.
I think you will like it.	Ke nahana hore o tla e rata.
And all you had to do was ask.	Mme sohle seo o neng o tlameha ho se etsa ke ho botsa.
His feelings would hurt.	Maikutlo a hae a ne a tla utloa bohloko.
Keep talking to her.	Tsoela pele ho bua le eena.
I had to hope that everything would work out.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho tšepa hore tsohle li tla sebetsa.
I started to cry.	Ke ile ka qala ho lla.
We've found your old style, not well-dressed.	Re fumane mofuta oa hau oa khale, o sa apara hantle.
We had a great time doing it.	Re bile le nako e monate ea ho e etsa.
She cried softly.	A lla ka bonolo.
I will never forget him.	Nke ke ka mo lebala.
Yes, you can.	Kea, u ka e etsa.
They say that the child could have been a boy.	Ba re ngoana e ka be e le moshanyana.
There’s a time to catch both, no ?.	Ho na le nako ea ho tšoara bobeli, che?.
You are useless.	Ha u na thuso.
But he certainly would do so.	Empa ka sebele o ne a tla etsa joalo.
They all spent the day.	Bohle ba ile ba qeta letsatsi.
Because anything is better than this.	Hobane eng kapa eng e molemo ho feta ena.
They did not ask him about his past life or about him.	Ha baa ka ba mo botsa ka bophelo ba hae ba nako e fetileng kapa ka eena.
Your family needs a lot of help right now.	Lelapa la hau le hloka thuso e ngata hona joale.
The group starts.	Sehlopha se qala.
It was no surprise.	E ne e se ntho e makatsang.
He was there last night.	O ne a le teng bosiung ba maobane.
That is not the case.	Ha se joalo.
I hope they will be his friends.	Ke tšepa hore e tla ba metsoalle ea hae.
Thank you so much for all your help!	Ke leboha haholo ka thuso ea hau eohle!
If not, say so.	Haeba ho se joalo, bua joalo.
We could have gone with him.	Re ka be re ile le eena.
Soon it would be inadequate.	Haufinyane ho ne ho tla be ho sa lekana.
And she sat here waiting for him.	Mme a dula mona a mo emetse.
I never talk about him.	Ha ho mohla ke buang ka eena.
He should have been able to help.	O ne a lokela hore ebe o ile a khona ho thusa.
To be with him.	Ho ba le eena.
But the decision is yours.	Empa qeto ke ea hao.
It is very difficult to earn money.	Ho thata haholo ho fumana chelete.
Thinking about yourself can help.	Ho nahana ka uena ho ka thusa.
He was reading a book at the time.	O ne a bala buka ka nako eo.
Finally, he agreed.	Qetellong, o ile a lumela.
The more he thought about it, the more he liked it.	Ha a ntse a nahana ka eona haholo, o ile a e rata le ho feta.
It was powerful, yet it was beautiful.	E ne e le matla, leha ho le joalo e ne e le ntle.
They and my parents don't know about it.	Bona le batsoali ba ka ha ba tsebe ka hona.
I think this could be a problem.	Ke nahana hore sena e ka ba bothata.
Then the problem.	Joale bothata.
You have seen his house.	U bone ntlo ea hae.
Maybe you should talk about the room.	Mohlomong o lokela ho bua ka kamore.
And now we are.	'Me joale re .
Many say that it is the best.	Ba bangata ba re ke eona e molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He did this before.	O entse sena pele.
Let him do this.	A etse sena.
He said his parents would not understand it.	O ile a re batsoali ba hae ba ne ba ke ke ba e utloisisa.
It was a wonderful week.	E ne e le beke e monate.
I think your opinion is just yours.	Ke nahana hore maikutlo a hau ke a hau feela.
Please pick up what you need.	Ka kopo nka seo u se hlokang.
So don’t be too sure about that.	Kahoo u seke ua ba le bonnete haholo ka seo.
It was painful.	Ho ne ho phela bohloko.
We'll look into it.	Re tla e sheba.
Try to understand the problem.	Leka ho utloisisa bothata.
I just got back home.	Ke sa tsoa khutlela hae.
So this is going to be fun.	Kahoo sena se tla ba monate.
Then he worked.	Ka mor'a moo o ile a sebetsa.
The car is really nice.	Koloi e monate ruri.
Everyone wants to help her.	E mong le e mong o batla ho mo thusa.
You can do this from anywhere.	U ka etsa sena ho tloha kae kapa kae.
You could hear them before you could see them.	U ne u ka li utloa pele u ka li bona.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka e etsa joang.
He could see nothing from here.	O ne a sa bone letho ho tloha mona.
Of course it would be.	Ehlile ho ne ho tla ba jwalo.
I probably would not do that.	Mohlomong nke ke ka etsa joalo.
I will not try this week.	Nke ke ka leka bekeng ena.
He benefited them in any way he could.	O ne a ba tsoela molemo ka tsela leha e le efe eo a ka e khonang.
But we have to stop, we work in a team.	Empa re tlameha ho ema, re sebetsa sehlopheng.
He is the only person of his age here.	Ke eena feela motho ea lilemo tsa hae mona.
He suffered at that time.	O ile a utloa bohloko nakong eo.
I mean no.	Ke bolela che.
It's a little.	Ke hanyane.
No one seemed to notice !.	Ha ho motho ea neng a bonahala a hlokomela!.
There is never a problem.	Le ka mohla ha ho bothata.
Kind of a place, maybe.	Mofuta oa sebaka, mohlomong.
Time period.	Nako ea nako.
It is no longer his.	Ha e sa le oa hae.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
Yes.	E ile.
As you buy in the background.	Joalo ka ha u reka ho ea ka morao.
Thank you for your understanding.	Kea leboha ha u utloisisa.
I don't want it to be me.	Ha ke batle hore e be nna.
And it will not take much of your time.	'Me e ke ke ea nka nako ea hau e ngata.
Everyone was happy.	Bohle ba ne ba thabile.
What time is it?	Ke nako mang?
Now they have it.	Joale ba na le eona.
I could not learn anything from them.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ithuta letho ho bona.
That money did not pass, of course.	Chelete eo ha ea ka ea feta, ehlile.
Just presence.	Ho ba teng feela.
That would be wrong.	Hoo e ka ba phoso.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	U tlameha feela ho tseba ho e bolella seo e lokelang ho se etsa.
There was plenty of time to be together.	Ho ne ho e-na le nako e ngata ea ho ba hammoho.
I will be learning, no matter what.	Ke tla be ke ntse ke ithuta, leha ho ka etsahala.
I'm not sure how you do it.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na u e etsa joang.
But he could not enjoy many other things.	Empa o ne a ke ke a khona ho thabela lintho tse ling tse ngata.
They were books.	E ne e le libuka.
It saves energy.	E boloka matla.
He seemed to have it all.	O ne a bonahala a e-na le eona kaofela.
I'm not sure about you.	Ha ke na bonnete ka uena.
He did what he did.	O entse seo a se entseng.
Easy to read.	Ho bonolo ho bala.
But she did not know.	Mme o ne a sa tsebe.
He is with you.	U na le uena.
I loved being in his team.	Ke ne ke rata ho ba sehlopheng sa hae.
I walk a little.	Ke tsamaea hanyane.
He asks questions by phone.	O botsa lipotso ka mohala.
Well, a lot of people have seen it.	Joalo, batho ba bangata ba e bone.
It's bad.	Na e mpe.
Not true.	Che ke 'nete.
So, it is useless.	Kahoo, ha ho na thuso.
She is a great mother.	Ke mme e moholo.
It's very simple.	E bonolo haholo.
Decide what you want to say before you say it.	Etsa qeto ea seo u batlang ho se bua pele u se bua.
It was not a question.	E ne e se potso.
Not too many.	Ha li ngata haholo.
Those times would never come again.	Linako tseo li ne li ke ke tsa tla hape.
This should not happen to a man.	Sena ha sea lokela ho etsahala ho monna.
I had no idea of ​​my value as a person.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe bohlokoa ba ka joaloka motho.
What is good for them is good for everyone.	Se molemo ho bona se molemo ho bohle.
I could not read it quickly enough.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e bala kapele ho lekana.
You will understand in time.	U tla utloisisa ka nako.
This is a little difficult for them.	Sena se ba thata hanyane.
They must have meant something very important.	E tlameha ebe ba bolela ntho ea bohlokoa haholo.
No one deserves to be.	Leha e le mang ha aa lokela.
Everyone knew him.	Bohle ba ne ba mo tseba.
Both with my friends.	Ka bobeli le metsoalle ea ka.
He loved both of them.	O ne a li rata ka bobeli.
I was happy.	Ke ne ke thabile.
He was very sad.	O ne a utloile bohloko haholo.
You can't ask for anything better than that.	U ke ke ua kopa ho molemo ho feta moo.
He had many.	O ne a ena le tse ngata.
We have seen this before.	Re kile ra bona sena pele.
I saw it often enough and knew it well.	Ke ne ke e bona hangata ho lekana mme ke e tseba hantle.
It was nice to be with him.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba le eena.
But this was one of them.	Empa ena e ne e le e ’ngoe ea tsona.
Everyone watched intently.	Bohle ba ile ba shebella ka hloko.
It looked good.	Ho ile ha bonahala hantle.
She feels better now.	O ikutloa a le betere hona joale.
Well, whatever.	Be, eng kapa eng.
I would read about them, it would help.	Ke ne ke tla bala ka tsona, ho ka thusa.
Some of them are my closest friends.	Ba bang ba bona ke metsoalle ea ka e haufi haholo.
Here we have a problem.	Mona re na le bothata.
We see what is happening here.	Re bona se etsahalang mona.
She will start writing her book next week.	O tla qala ho ngola buka ya hae bekeng e tlang.
I could see your hands and feet.	Ke ne ke bona ka matsoho le maoto a hau.
To know him.	Ho mo tseba.
They do not want to go anywhere.	Ha ba batle ho ea kae kapa kae.
It's you and you know it.	Ke uena 'me ua e tseba.
They are not mine.	Ha se tsa ka.
They love children, but they do not really see them.	Ba rata bana, mme ha ba ba bone hakaalo.
That doesn't matter.	Seo ha se na taba.
My father saw them too.	Ntate le eena o ile a ba bona.
That is none of my business.	Seo ha se taba ea ka.
Book A and decided to give it a try.	Buka ea A mme a etsa qeto ea ho e leka.
There are so many nearby, you know.	Ho na le ba bangata ba haufi, ua tseba.
My boyfriend thought it was weird.	Mohlankana oa ka o ne a nahana hore ke ntho e makatsang.
There it is, mother's water.	Ke eo moo, metsi a mme.
Please go without me.	Ke kopa o tsamaee ntle le 'na.
I am not a police officer.	Ha ke mapolesa.
There has never been a better time.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba le nako e betere.
He had never seen it come.	O ne a eso bone e tla.
But you do.	Empa u etsa joalo.
Then we will see what we can do.	Joale re tla bona seo re ka se etsang.
That is what we want to be.	Ke seo re batlang ho ba sona.
We both learned to sing at the same time.	Ka bobeli re ile ra ithuta ho bina ka nako e le ’ngoe.
We do not understand them.	Ha re li utloisise.
One was that he felt better.	E ’ngoe e ne e le hore o ne a ikutloa a le betere.
It was not as bad as the danger he was in.	E ne e se mpe joalo ka kotsi eo a neng a le ho eona.
I need you even more.	Ke u hloka le ho feta.
However, I would not consider it important.	Leha ho le joalo, nke ke ka e nka e le ea bohlokoa.
He just bought a new car.	O sa tsoa reka koloi e ncha.
You should only do it once.	U lokela ho e etsa hang feela.
I can trust it !.	Nka tšepa!.
We can't even see them now.	Ha re khone le ho feta ho bona hona joale.
He could have done this.	A ka be a entse sena.
It's almost like that.	Ho batla ho le joalo.
A few years.	Lilemo tse seng kae.
Here I am.	Ke mona.
Some are easy to fix.	Tse ling li bonolo ho li lokisa.
As a child, she played with the house.	Ha e sa le ngoana, o ne a bapala ntlo.
But we will never see this again.	Empa ha re sa tla bona sena se tla.
It is their money.	Ke chelete ea bona.
I want to save.	Ke batla ho boloka.
He worked on it yesterday.	O ile ho sebetsa ka eona maobane.
They were arrested, too.	Ba ile ba tšoaroa, le bona.
It is coming soon.	E tla haufinyane.
How little did they know.	Ba ne ba tseba hanyane hakae.
It must have been a no better place.	E tlameha ebe e ne e se sebaka se setle ho feta seo.
And no one else.	Hape ha ho motho e mong.
However, everyone wants to be the best.	Leha ho le joalo, bohle ba batla ho ba ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Also, you have to be in it to win it.	Hape, o tlameha ho ba ho eona ho e hlola.
It was someone else.	E ne e le motho e mong.
The night will take a long time.	Bosiu bo tla nka nako e telele.
Either way it will work.	Mofuta ofe kapa ofe o tla sebetsa.
To ask him.	Ho mo kopa.
A great way to help people.	Mokhoa o motle oa ho thusa batho.
Very well it is.	Hantle haholo ke eona.
There was no point in doing anything.	Ho ne ho se na thuso ea ho etsa letho.
They have a place from everything.	Ba na le sebaka se itseng ho tloha ho tsohle.
He knows his phone.	O tseba mohala oa hae.
Both of my parents work full-time.	Batsoali ba ka ka bobeli ba sebetsa ka nako eohle.
I mean, he never tried it.	Ke bolela, ha ho mohla a kileng a e leka.
So he can be with her.	Kahoo a ka ba le eena.
I go back to them.	Ke khutlela ho tsona.
I want him.	Kea mo batla.
It was too early.	E ne e le pele haholo.
And more for me.	Le tse ling bakeng sa ka.
That is not all.	Ha se seo feela.
I would like to go swimming.	Nka thabela ho ea sesa.
So for years, that’s what they used.	Kahoo ka lilemo, ke seo ba neng ba se sebelisa.
I can't say we can't do it anymore.	Nke ke ka re re ke ke ra hlola re e etsa.
I think there may be others.	Ke nahana hore ho ka ba le ba bang.
We made life.	Re entse bophelo.
I could not even stand in front.	Ke ne ke sitoa le ho ema ka pele.
The same was true of his wife and son.	Ho ne ho le joalo le ka mosali oa hae le mora.
If you were in his situation, what would you do?	Haeba u ne u le eena, u ne u tla etsa’ng?
I did not want to spend the evening alone.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho qeta mantsiboea ke le mong.
Look at what he did to you.	Sheba seo a u entseng sona.
Please take it.	Ke kopa o e nke.
He will not forget that soon.	A ke ke a lebala seo kapele.
Neither of man.	Leha e le ea motho.
All we can do now is wait.	Seo re ka se etsang hona joale ke ho ema.
Almost all of them, though.	Hoo e ka bang bohle, leha ho le joalo.
They can be beautiful.	Li ka ba ntle.
What is it.	Ke eng.
At the same time.	Ka nako e tšoanang.
He asked her why.	O ile a mo botsa lebaka.
For you, nothing can be easier.	Ho uena, ha ho letho le ka bang bonolo haholoanyane.
He went with the man, too.	O ile a tsamaea le motho, le eena.
I do not know about others.	Ha ke tsebe ka tse ling.
I enjoy watching them.	Ke thabela ho li shebella.
They should not tell you what to do.	Ha ba a lokela ho o bolella seo o lokelang ho se etsa.
I love them all !.	Ke ba rata kaofela!.
Little by little, somehow.	Hanyane ka hanyane, ka tsela e itseng.
He wasn't, at once.	O ne a se jwalo, hang.
Now look at yourself.	Joale sheba ka uena.
They want you or they don't want you.	Ba u batla kapa ha ba u batle.
Very good, indeed.	E ntle haholo, ka 'nete.
We really did not know about that.	Re ne re hlile re sa tsebe ka seo.
Now our job is much easier.	Joale mosebetsi oa rona o bonolo haholoanyane.
They are powerful.	Ba ba matla.
Otherwise, you will have problems.	Ho seng joalo, u tla ba le mathata.
Here you go.	Ke tsena.
You can try but you will probably suffer then.	U ka leka empa mohlomong u tla utloa bohloko nakong eo.
It would not be in the morning.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha eba hoseng.
It’s better to make it easier for me.	Ho molemo ho etsa hore ho be bonolo ho 'na.
They don't have to have anything better to do.	Ha baa tlameha ho ba le letho le betere leo ba ka le etsang.
I'm right about this.	Ke hantle ka sena.
He wouldn't have told you that kind of thing.	A ka be a sa ka a o bolella ntho ya mofuta oo.
It makes for a very long time.	E etsa hore nako e telele haholo.
He did not like this at all.	O ne a sa rate sena ho hang.
They worked hard.	Ba ne ba sebetsa ka thata.
She is incredibly good and very informative.	O hantle ka mokhoa o makatsang le ho fana ka litaba.
They can be bad too.	Li ka ba mpe le tsona.
Maybe he needed to get in there to do that.	Mohlomong o ne a hloka ho kena moo ho etsa joalo.
Then it came out.	Eaba e tsoa.
He stopped and looked at her.	A ema mme a mo sheba.
Or rather, they bought those things.	Kapa ho e-na le hoo, ba ile ba reka lintho tseo.
How did he feel this morning?	O ne a ikutloa joang hoseng hona?
I will come.	Ke tla tla.
Everywhere, one gets the idea.	Kae kapa kae, motho o fumana mohopolo.
It's nothing.	Ha se letho.
My job is not difficult.	Mosebetsi oa ka ha o boima.
But they probably did.	Empa mohlomong ba bile teng.
We had it.	Re ne re e-na le eona.
Living in them is.	Ho phela ho tsona ke.
There is no woman.	Ha ho na mosali.
I see it coming.	Ke e bona e tla.
We are here for a while.	Re mona ka nako e itseng.
Keep trying, and you will get there.	Tsoela pele ho leka, 'me u tla fihla moo.
It seemed like a second chance.	E ne eka ke monyetla oa bobeli.
Important things.	Lintho tsa bohlokoa.
He said he was doing strange things.	O ile a bolela hore o ne a etsa lintho tse makatsang.
To call him.	Ho mo letsetsa.
I asked a simple question.	Ke ile ka botsa potso e bonolo.
There were good things.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ntle.
They just walked away.	Ba ne ba tsamaea feela.
There are many more.	Ho na le lintho tse ling tse ngata hape.
It does not seem to exist.	Ho bonahala eka ha e eo.
Or tonight, or the same.	Kapa bosiung bona, kapa hona hoo.
My opinion is that you have no particular opinion.	Maikutlo a ka ke hore ha u na maikutlo a itseng.
They are long.	Li telele.
We need a doctor right away.	Re hloka ngaka kapele.
They do that and it looks good.	Ba etsa ntho eo mme e shebahala e le ntle.
Every day, it comes back.	Letsatsi le leng le le leng, e khutlela morao.
I don’t think we found them very effective.	Ha ke nahane hore re li fumane li sebetsa haholo.
She is not beautiful.	Ha a motle.
Of course, that is not the case.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho joalo.
People live here.	Batho ba lula mona.
I would appreciate any help.	Ke tla leboha thuso efe kapa efe.
I came to her aid, and so I did.	Ke ile ka tla ho tla mo thusa, ’me kahoo ka etsa joalo.
I will look at it.	Ke tla e sheba.
Please believe that.	Ke kopa o lumele seo.
It was a high time.	E ne e le nako e phahameng.
I understand more than you think.	Ke utloisisa ho feta kamoo u nahanang kateng.
It is so emotional.	Ho joalo ka maikutlo.
They heard it.	Ba e utloile.
It's hard to imagine.	Ho thata ho nahana.
It's hard to imagine now.	Ho thata ho nahana joale.
But now there is a problem.	Empa joale ho na le bothata.
But it does not have to be.	Empa ha ho hlokahale hore ho be joalo.
But in reality nothing could be further from the truth.	Empa ha e le hantle ha ho letho leo e ka bang 'nete ho feta moo.
I can tell you too.	Le nna nka o bolella.
Maybe even more.	Mohlomong le ho feta.
Tomorrow he could trust again.	Hosane o ne a ka tšepa hape.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Ho ne ho se letho le phoso ka seo.
It was so beautiful.	E ne e le ntle haholo.
He felt empty.	O ile a ikutloa a se na letho.
But it will not be long.	Empa ho ke ke ha nka nako e telele.
You know.	O ya tseba.
He was good to me and my children.	O ne a le molemo ho nna le bana ba ka.
No people are so nice.	Ha ho batho ba batle hakaalo.
For the morning.	Bakeng sa hoseng.
But we were there.	Empa re ne re le teng.
I needed their help.	Ke ne ke hloka thuso ea bona.
We are the worst.	Re ba mpe ka ho fetisisa.
Wait for a second.	Ema bakeng sa bobeli.
So my time there was fun.	Kahoo nako ea ka moo e ne e le monate.
The fact is, we do not.	'Nete ke hore ha re etse joalo.
You look at what happened.	U sheba se etsahetseng.
They will do it, but they know it is not their decision to do it.	Ba tla e etsa, empa ba a tseba hore ha se qeto ya bona ho e etsa.
A second activity took place.	Ho ile ha etsahala mosebetsi oa bobeli.
However, they looked stronger than before.	Leha ho le joalo, li ne li shebahala li le matla ho feta pele.
Probably just fine.	Mohlomong e ntle feela.
I can't talk about it tonight.	Ha ke khone ho bua ka eona bosiung bona.
Until next year !.	Ho fihlela selemong se tlang!.
I see it there.	Kea e bona moo.
The children stay there for hours.	Bana ba lula moo ka lihora tse ngata.
Well, quit.	Hantle, tlohela.
Time does that.	Nako e etsa seo.
I have not tried breakfast.	Ha kea leka lijo tsa hoseng.
You will love it.	U tla e rata.
When you drink more than you want to pass.	Ha u noa ho feta moo u batlang ho feta.
I need to think about this.	Ke hloka ho nahana ka sena.
I like the way you think.	Ke rata tsela eo u nahanang ka eona.
He took the position.	O ile a nka boemo.
It's hard to believe he doesn't exist.	Ho thata ho lumela hore ha a eo.
Anyway, take your route.	Leha ho le joalo, nka tsela ea hau.
So he went on.	Kahoo a tsoela pele.
For the things you want.	Bakeng sa lintho tseo u li batlang.
It was something he had been thinking about for a long time.	E ne e le ntho eo esale a e nahana ka nako e telele.
As you speak, he does not understand.	Ha u ntse u bua, ha a utloisise.
We can have a lot of that.	Re ka ba le tse ngata tsa seo.
He left, but it was too late.	O ile a tloha, empa e ne e se e le morao haholo.
They do the job well.	Ba etsa mosebetsi oo hantle.
They found a car.	Ba ile ba fumana koloi.
The task was daunting.	Mosebetsi oo o ne o le boima haholo.
We were not around, although we wanted to be there.	Re ne re se haufi, le hoja re ne re batla ho ba teng.
I will do this thing.	Ke tla etsa ntho ena.
Say it after me.	E bue ka mora ka.
I often drank heavily.	Hangata ke ne ke khona ho e noa haholo.
By production.	Ka tlhahiso.
They come with anything.	Ba tla ka eng kapa eng.
The day did not start well.	Letsatsi le ne le sa qala hantle.
This requires more than water to complete.	Sena se hloka ho feta metsi ho e qeta.
We must seize this opportunity.	Re tlameha ho nka monyetla ona.
And he really wants coffee.	Mme ehlile o batla kofi.
It was here before.	E bile mona pele.
For the people, for me.	Bakeng sa batho, bakeng sa ka.
If this.	Haeba sena.
You would hear about them from time to time.	U ne u tla utloa ka tsona nako le nako.
That's what everyone had.	Ke seo bohle ba neng ba ena le sona.
He wanted to finish it.	O ne a batla ho e qeta.
I can no longer.	Ha ke sa khona.
I want to finish my work here.	Ke batla ho qeta mosebetsi oa ka mona.
I have a good tool.	Ke sebetsa se setle.
He came to me.	A tla ho nna.
He wanted to know if she wanted to be his wife.	O ne a batla ho tseba hore o batla ho ba mosali oa hae.
I didn't have to.	Ha kea tlameha.
After that it must be true.	Ka morao ho moo e tlameha ebe ke 'nete.
We have no more.	Ha re sa na tse ling.
I like the idea of ​​it.	Ke rata mohopolo oa eona.
This is very important.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo.
But it was actually more than that.	Empa ha e le hantle e ne e le ho feta moo.
There was not much more I could say.	Ho ne ho se na tse ling tse ngata tseo nka li buang.
I see you walking.	Kea u bona u tsamaea.
Yet he had seen both of them.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a ba bone ka bobeli.
Due to space constraints.	Ka lebaka la mathata a sebaka.
Yes, we have a baby.	E, re na le ngoana.
But he knew mine too.	Empa o ne a tseba le ea ka.
He said no, no, he would not do that.	A re che, che, a ke ke a etsa joalo.
He drove and drove.	O ile a khanna le ho khanna.
The search for her continued into the night.	Ho mo batla ho ile ha tsoela pele ho fihlela bosiu.
But it should not be.	Empa ha ea lokela ho ba teng.
He often does.	Hangata o etsa joalo.
I just visited.	Ke sa tsoa etela.
I think money is the way to go.	Ke nahana hore chelete ke eona tsela ea ho tsamaea.
It was hard to leave this group.	Ho ne ho le thata ho tloha sehlopheng sena.
You can’t let him go and that’s it.	U ke ke ua mo tlohela 'me ho joalo.
Imagine if the person did not care.	Nahana hore na motho eo o ne a sa tsotelle.
Ask your family.	Botsa lelapa la hao.
That had never happened before.	Seo se ne se e-s'o ka se etsahala pele.
Somehow, it didn’t seem important until now.	Ka tsela e itseng, e ne e sa bonahale e le bohlokoa ho fihlela joale.
Then he tried again.	Eaba o leka hape.
The picture was beautiful.	Setšoantšo se ne se le setle.
He looked up.	A sheba.
This is not a team project.	Sena ha se mosebetsi oa sehlopha.
There were people who really knew what was going on.	Ho ne ho e-na le batho ba neng ba hlile ba tseba se etsahalang.
He studied hard to become a doctor.	O ile a ithuta ka thata hore e be ngaka.
I want you to know.	Ke batla hore o tsebe.
He would play with her.	O ne a tla bapala le eena.
I think a lot of people wanted him to be that way.	Ke nahana hore batho ba bangata ba ne ba batla hore a be joalo.
He felt incredibly strong.	O ile a ikutloa a le matla ka tsela e makatsang.
Life was hard.	Bophelo bo ne bo le boima haholo.
Of course the question is.	Ehlile potso ke hore na.
May you live a long and happy life!	E se eka u ka phela nako e telele 'me u thabile!
This means you will not be in danger.	Sena se bolela hore u ke ke ua ba kotsing.
Would you like to go for a walk?	O ka thabela ho tsamaea le nna?
However, the only professional approach would be to continue.	Leha ho le joalo, mokhoa feela oa setsebi e ne e tla ba ho tsoela pele.
If we are, we are here.	Haeba re le teng, re mona.
I'm not talking about me.	Ke sa bue ka nna.
But they make us who we are.	Empa ba re etsa seo re leng sona.
He came out.	O ile a tsoa.
Just do your job.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau feela.
He says one of us.	O re e mong oa rona.
Someone would hear something.	Motho e mong o ne a tla utloa ho hong.
Then we can certainly trust.	Joale ka sebele re ka tšepa.
But she doesn't want to tell me anything.	Empa ha a sa batla ho mpolella letho.
But he has not yet found it.	Empa ha a e-s'o e fumane.
I only help them use water.	Ke ba thusa feela ho sebelisa metsi.
The way forward is not easy to know.	Tsela ea ho ea pele ha e bonolo ho e tseba.
But no one knows.	Empa ha ho motho ea tsebang.
They opened up this opportunity in every place.	Ba ile ba bula monyetla ona sebakeng se seng le se seng.
It works very well too.	E sebetsa hantle haholo hape.
Until school starts.	Ho fihlela sekolo se qala.
No, but he did not.	Che, empa o ne a se na eona.
People who know you.	Batho ba o tsebang.
Stop right here.	Ema hona sebakeng sena.
After dinner, he planned his day.	Ka mor'a lijo tsa mantsiboea, o ile a rera letsatsi la hae.
We do not know how.	Ha re tsebe joang.
I did nothing wrong.	Ha kea etsa letho le phoso.
It was an issue we did not have to deal with.	Ke taba eo re neng re sa tlameha ho bua le eona.
He looked to see if anyone knew him.	A sheba ho bona hore na ho na le motho eo a mo tsebang.
You will love it.	O tla e rata.
The higher the one went, the more he paid.	Ha ea phahameng a ne a ea, ea neng a lefa haholo.
However, his decision was simple.	Leha ho le joalo, qeto ea hae e ne e le bonolo.
I have a few to work with.	Ke na le ba 'maloa ba ho sebetsa.
I'm not happy.	Ha ke monate.
You know you want to.	Ua tseba hore ua batla.
Clearly, they were trying to outdo others.	Ho hlakile hore ba ne ba leka ho feta ba bang.
Insufficient time.	Nako e sa lekaneng.
The woman begged him not to leave her.	Mosali a mo kopa hore a se ke a mo tlohela.
I can't ask it.	Ha ke khone ho e botsa.
I see the problem.	Ke bona bothata.
It was an accident of all kinds.	E ne e le kotsi ea mofuta kaofela.
We never said anything about why we were doing this.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra bua letho ka hore na ke hobane'ng ha re etsa sena.
I had a name.	Ke ne ke na le lebitso.
And I don't get enough energy.	'Me ha ke fumane matla a lekaneng.
Maybe it was real.	Mohlomong e ne e le oa 'nete.
Parents know their child better than anyone else.	Batsoali ba tseba ngoana oa bona ho feta mang kapa mang.
He loved her, he loved the life they had.	O ne a mo rata, a rata bophelo boo ba neng ba e-na le bona.
But it did not help them.	Empa ha ea ka ea ba thusa.
We do not know exactly what is going on.	Ha re tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahalang.
I want something to be aware of.	Ke batla ho hong ho hlokomela.
You could not do this to someone you love.	U ne u ke ke ua etsa sena ho motho eo u mo ratang.
Instead, it works in the background.	Ho e-na le hoo, e sebetsa ka morao.
.	.
I will not go away for long.	Ha ke sa tla tsamaea nako e telele.
I just loved it.	Ke ne ke e rata feela.
I will not do that.	Ha ke tlo etsa joalo.
So, another working week is coming to an end.	Kahoo, beke e 'ngoe ea ho sebetsa e tla tloha e fihla qetellong.
They will continue to work with us.	Ba tla tsoela pele ho sebetsa le rona.
It was really fun.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le monate.
It hurts a lot.	Ho bohloko haholo.
It really has that.	E hlile e na le hoo.
I do not have it.	Ha ke na eona.
You can do anything else.	O ka etsa eng kapa eng hape.
Everyone was busy in their own way.	E mong le e mong o ne a phathahane ka tsela ea hae.
I agreed to stand.	Ke ile ka lumela ho ema.
We spent time together.	Re ile ra qeta nako re le hammoho.
I don't know what to do from here.	Ha ke tsebe seo nka se etsang ho tloha mona.
I would stay again.	Ke ne ke tla lula hape.
No, they do not.	Che, ha ba etse joalo.
They are of no use to him.	Ha ba na thuso ho eena.
See, I, we were all alone.	Bona, nna, re ne re le bang.
Moreover we cannot say anything at this time.	Ho feta moo re ka se bue letho ka nako ena.
However, this is not true.	Leha ho le joalo, sena hase ’nete.
I could not find a reason.	Ha kea ka ka fumana lebaka.
It's not our problem.	Ha se bothata ba rona.
You will tell her that you love her.	U tla mo bolella hore ua mo rata.
Now that was not the time.	Joale e ne e se eona nako eo.
I heard about it almost every day.	Ke ne ke utloa ka eona hoo e ka bang letsatsi le leng le le leng.
It will be very dangerous.	Ho tla ba kotsi haholo.
He refused to do so.	O ile a hana ho etsa joalo.
I do not want to see another proposal today.	Ha ke batle ho bona tlhahiso e 'ngoe kajeno.
Maybe he had a hard day.	Mohlomong o ne a bile le letsatsi le thata.
Do not try to call her either.	Le uena u se ke ua leka ho mo letsetsa.
As never before.	Joalo ka ha ho mohla.
I do not need your money.	Ha ke hloke chelete ea hau.
Then he would have even more problems.	Joale o ne a tla ba le mathata le ho feta.
I do not know what kind of person I am.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke ea mofuta ofe.
But that was not the worst thing that could happen.	Empa hoo e ne e se ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
She was really beautiful.	O bile motle ruri.
Some children have never learned to read and write.	Bana ba bang ha ho mohla ba kileng ba ithuta ho bala le ho ngola.
Now I begin to see why.	Hona joale ke qala ho bona lebaka.
He was very alone.	O ne a le mong haholo.
Think about what you are doing.	Nahana ka seo u se etsang.
This is just one thing.	Ena ke ntho e le 'ngoe feela.
It was real.	E ne e le ntho ea sebele.
We hope you enjoy the stay here.	Re tšepa hore u tla thabela ho boloka mona.
Everyone has them.	E mong le e mong o na le tsona.
He felt better when he was at home.	O ile a ikutloa a le betere ha a se a le hae.
None of them belong to me.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona ea ka.
To say the least.	Ho bua hanyane.
That can take a very long time.	Seo se ka nka nako e telele haholo.
I have to play.	Ke tlameha ho bapala.
I will never be here again.	Ha ke sa tla ba mona.
What must he be thinking?	E tlameha ebe o ntse a nahana eng?
It seemed so easy at the time.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le bonolo haholo ka nako eo.
He watched intently to see what would happen next.	O ile a shebella ka hloko ho bona hore na ho tla etsahala’ng ka mor’a moo.
He loved them very much.	O ne a ba rata haholo.
He is great to be here.	O moholo ho ba mona.
She has to go home to see her baby.	O tlameha ho khutlela hae ho ea bona ngoana oa hae.
But he doesn't talk to me.	Empa ha a bue le nna.
However, they know the feelings when he arrives.	Leha ho le joalo, ba tseba maikutlo ha a fihla.
You are more than a player.	U feta sebapali.
And after all that happened.	Le ka mora tsohle tse etsahetseng.
He will find what he can do.	O tla fumana seo a ka se etsang.
Here is what happened.	Se etsahetseng ke sena.
That is what hurts.	Ke sona se bohloko.
For others.	Bakeng sa ba bang.
I didn't care what happened to me.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle hore na ho tla etsahala'ng ka 'na.
I'm not sure what's going on.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahalang.
He didn't say much, of course.	Ha a ka a bua hakaalo, ha e le hantle.
However, help did not arrive on time.	Leha ho le joalo, thuso ha ea ka ea fihla ka nako.
But there is no picture.	Empa haho setšoantšo.
I will write it as it progresses.	Ke tla e ngola ha e ntse e tsoela pele.
Maybe if he had just told her.	Mohlomong haeba a ne a mo boleletse feela .
It is too late.	E se e le morao haholo.
Let him speak.	A ke a bue.
He goes from place to place.	O tloha sebakeng ho ya sebakeng.
I need to work fast.	Ke hloka ho sebetsa kapele.
It's his fault.	Ke molato oa hae.
Quick, go ahead!	Kapele, tsoela pele!
But it wasn't his time, it wasn't his time.	Empa e ne e se nako ya hae, e ne e se nako ya hae.
There was no way to live this way.	Ho ne ho se na mokhoa oa ho phela ka mokhoa ona.
Time to move on.	Nako ea ho tsoela pele.
Maybe it was.	Mohlomong e ne e le.
We know about it now but.	Re tseba ka eona hona joale empa.
Doing so will make my life even more enjoyable.	Ka ho etsa joalo ho tla etsa hore bophelo ba ka bo be monate le ho feta.
This will help you to sleep better at night.	Sena se tla u thusa ho robala hantle bosiu.
I love your idea.	Ke rata mohopolo oa hau.
Or read about it.	Kapa ho bala ka eona.
It is very easy to be good.	Ho bonolo haholo ho ba molemo.
I don't want you to think about me.	Ha ke batle hore o nahane ka nna.
And this is not just my opinion.	Mme sena ha se maikutlo a ka feela.
You have to go all out.	Le tlameha ho tsamaea kaofela.
For me, this works even harder.	Ho 'na, sena se sebetsa le ho feta.
It's hard to believe.	Ho thata ho lumela.
I know her better than anyone else.	Ke mo tseba ho feta mang kapa mang.
Because of their mental strength.	Ka lebaka la matla a bona a kelello.
We will have to keep an eye on it.	Re tla lokela ho dula re sheba.
Since then, no one has seen him.	Ho tloha ka nako eo, ha ho motho ea kileng a mo bona.
That's right, if it happens.	Ho joalo, haeba ho etsahala.
My mother was very happy.	’Mè o ne a thabile haholo.
You must, because it looked good.	O tlameha, hobane e ne e shebahala e le ntle.
However, that was not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se joalo.
They were all very tired.	Kaofela ha bona ba ne ba khathetse haholo.
I had decided.	Ke ne ke entse qeto.
Thank you for your comment and speak again soon.	Kea leboha ka taba ea hau 'me u bue hape haufinyane.
Which is what it is.	E leng seo e leng sona.
He was gentle, very.	O ne a le bonolo, haholo.
You will have to tell them.	O tla lokela ho ba bolella.
He was a very handsome man.	E ne e le monna ya motle haholo.
I will go and look for him.	Ke tla ea ho mo batla.
It used to be.	E ne e se e kile ea ba joalo.
We could not stay with him.	Re ne re sitoa ho lula le eena.
Then he let her go.	Eaba oa mo tlohela.
I have to tell my husband.	Ke tlameha ho bolella monna oa ka.
He probably won't find you in it.	Mohlomong a ke ke a u fumana ho eona.
Dog problem too.	Bothata ba ntja hape.
Until last week.	Ho fihlela bekeng e fetileng.
Try to imagine what his life was like.	Leka ho nahana hore na bophelo ba hae bo bile joang.
I was not sleeping.	Ke ne ke sa robala.
I hope you can find a way to fix it.	Kea tšepa u ka fumana mokhoa oa ho e lokisa.
Sometimes they have to.	Ka linako tse ling ba tlameha ho etsa joalo.
Many people would have seen him.	Batho ba bangata ba ka be ba ile ba mo bona.
Maybe I just wanted him to keep playing with it.	Mohlomong ke ne ke batla hore a lule a bapala ka eona.
It looked very nice.	E ne e shebahala e le ntle haholo.
There is nothing wrong with the way he felt.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka tsela eo a neng a ikutloa ka eona.
Then he said he would come.	Eaba o re o tla tla.
You need to eat.	O hloka ho ja lijo.
I feel this.	Ke utloa sena.
It's not a good type.	Ha se mofuta o motle.
It meant something, that he was sure.	Ho ne ho bolela ho hong, hore o ne a na le bonnete.
Because he was very strong.	Hobane o ne a le matla haholo.
Next time, maybe.	Nakong e tlang, mohlomong.
But since then, he has never met.	Empa haesale ho tloha ka nako eo, ha a eso kopane.
I'm tired of standing here.	Ke khathetse ke ho ema mona.
He ate his favorite food.	O ile a ja lijo tseo a li ratang haholo.
We are leaving early this morning, he says.	Re tsamaea esale hoseng kajeno, o re.
He was very sad.	O ne a utloile bohloko haholo.
Both work well.	Bobeli ba sebetsa hantle.
So we are no longer watching this.	Kahoo ha re sa shebella sena.
I know what you're thinking.	Ke tseba seo o se nahanang.
I am happy with my decision to buy this place.	Ke thabetse qeto ea ka ea ho reka sebaka sena.
I did not pretend.	Ha kea etsa eka.
It's none of my business.	Ha se taba ea ka.
It was very difficult for some.	Ho ne ho le boima haholo ho ba bang.
They were so delicious.	Li ne li le monate haholo.
That too was not easy.	Le hoo ho ne ho se bonolo.
He works there, too.	O sebetsa moo, hape.
Or make dinner.	Kapa ho etsa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
He would not have left her.	A ka be a sa ka a mo tlohela.
I look forward to it.	ke e lebeletse.
It was the reality of the whole situation.	E ne e le bonnete ba boemo bohle.
I thought they were true at the time.	Ke ne ke nahana hore li ne li le ’nete ka nako eo.
Also, make sure it works.	Hape, etsa bonnete ba hore e sebetsa.
We did not even know them.	Re ne re bile re sa ba tsebe.
They were coming.	Ba ne ba e tla.
Do it right.	E etse hantle.
More than three.	Ho feta joalo ka tse tharo.
Going back is not enough.	Ho khutlela morao ha hoa lekana.
My children are very happy there.	Bana ba ka ba thabile haholo moo.
This was a terrible mistake.	Ena e ne e le phoso e mpe haholo.
He was very happy to be back home.	O ne a thabile haholo hore ebe o ile a khutlela hae.
He didn't talk much.	O ne a sa bue haholo.
I never was.	Ha ke so ka ka ba jwalo.
I had no idea.	Ke ne ke sena maikutlo.
These things are not dangerous.	Lintho tsena ha li kotsi.
I did not think so.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore ho joalo.
You were very close to him.	U ne u e-na le eena haufi haholo.
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le joalo.
At one point he saw someone like him.	Ka nako e ’ngoe o ile a bona motho ea tšoanang le eena.
You know what you have there.	U tseba seo u nang le sona moo.
We knew it wasn't just about money for us.	Re ne re tseba hore e ne e se feela ka chelete bakeng sa rona.
It helped a lot.	E ile ea thusa haholo.
And maybe he shouldn’t do that.	'Me mohlomong ho molemo hore a se ke a etsa joalo.
I do not know such a person.	Ha ke tsebe motho ea joalo.
He wondered why he even asked first.	A ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha a bile a botsa pele.
Did he have a wife or a child?	Na o ne a e-na le mosali kapa ngoana?
He was still feeling.	O ne a ntse a ikutloa.
I knew that name.	Ke ne ke tseba lebitso leo.
I had to ask questions.	Ke ne ke lokela ho botsa lipotso.
It was not there before.	E ne e le sieo pele.
Of course I did not expect it to be working.	Ehlile ke ne ke sa lebella hore o tla be o ntse o sebetsa.
You must love them.	O tlameha ho ba rata.
You look absent.	U shebahala u le sieo.
However, it will happen.	Leha ho le joalo, e tla etsahala.
Then we will talk again.	Ka mor'a moo re tla bua hape.
There is nothing he can think of.	Ha ho letho leo a ka le nahanang.
Tonight can be good.	Bosiung bona bo ka ba molemo.
However, no one ever bought anything from them.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho ea kileng a reka letho ho bona.
This work has its ups and downs.	Mosebetsi ona o na le mathata le mathata.
The past, present and future are all useful.	Nako e fetileng, ea hona joale le ea nako e tlang kaofela e na le thuso.
Too bad, learning to live with it.	E mpe, ho ithuta ho phela le eona.
I found her in the classroom.	Ke mo fumane ka phaposing.
My father meant something to her.	Ntate o ne a bolela ho hong ho eena.
Every day was.	Letsatsi le leng le le leng e ne e le.
I love you so much.	Ke u rata haholo.
Maybe he does.	Mohlomong o etsa joalo.
They read the book at night.	Ba bala buka eo bosiu.
They nodded and he kept talking.	Ba mo kopa ka hlooho mme a nna a bua.
Take care of people.	Hlokomela batho.
I think we'll have to wait and see.	Ke nahana hore re tla tlameha ho ema re bone.
I just couldn’t think of it.	Ke ne nke ke ka e nahana feela.
Not his.	Che ea hae.
However, they would watch him.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba tla mo shebella.
He did not ask what he thought.	Ha a ka a botsa hore na o nahana eng.
Can I be the first to see them ?.	Na nka ba oa pele ho bona?.
We cannot walk without water.	Re ke ke ra tsamaea ntle le metsi.
I could trust him.	Ke ne ke ka mo tšepa.
You know how much time you will spend together.	Ua tseba hore na le tla qeta nako e kae le le hammoho.
What you can do.	Seo u ka se etsang.
No one wanted these things.	Ha ho motho ea neng a batla lintho tsena.
I have to go now.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea hona joale.
The young man thanked her profusely.	Mohlankana eo o ile a mo leboha haholo.
It may be better for you to visit.	Ho ka ba molemo ho uena ho etela.
I had to be strong for the kids.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho ba matla bakeng sa bana.
I always think so and you will do the same.	Ke lula ke nahana joalo le uena u tla etsa joalo.
But I ask for help.	Empa ke kopa thuso.
The fault lies with them.	Molato ke oa bona.
I did not have to wait long.	Ha kea ka ka tlameha ho ema nako e telele.
This method is relatively easy to master.	Mokhoa ona o batla o le bonolo ho o tseba.
It's better to have something '.	Ho molemo ho ba le ho hong'.
Without it, you will not be able to do it.	Ntle le eona, u ke ke ua khona ho e etsa.
I could not function properly.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho sebetsa hantle.
They were waiting for him.	Ba ne ba mo emetse.
Only the first.	Ea pele feela.
The man was the only thing he knew.	Monna e ne e le eena feela ntho eo a e tsebang.
To know what happened and where he was.	Ho tseba se etsahetseng le moo a neng a le teng.
It's a real thing.	Ke ntho ea sebele.
It’s so easy that way.	Ho bonolo haholo ka tsela eo.
They are exactly the same questions.	Ke lipotso tse tšoanang hantle.
To speak, or to feel in a certain way.	Ho bua, kapa ho ikutloa ka tsela e itseng.
I can stay with everyone.	Ke khona ho lula ke le teng le motho e mong le e mong.
The day was important.	Letsatsi e ne e le la bohlokoa.
They did not eat him.	Ba ne ba sa mo je.
Not at all visible.	Ho hang ha ho bonahale.
It was good, he thought.	Ho ne ho le molemo, a nahana.
I don't know why.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hobaneng.
She hasn't seen anyone yet.	Ha a e-so bone motho e mong ho fihlela joale.
And so it is, indeed.	Mme ho jwalo, ruri.
He never wanted to give it up.	Ho ne ho se mohla a kileng a batla ho e tlohela.
Now, we have both.	Joale, re na le bobeli.
We are meeting.	Re ntse re kopana.
And all these things happened over time.	'Me lintho tsena tsohle li ile tsa etsahala ka mor'a nako.
You have to make money.	U tlameha ho etsa chelete.
I go with it.	Ke tsamaea le eona.
I have done that several times.	Ke entse seo ka makhetlo a 'maloa.
It's not for you.	Ha se bakeng sa hao.
When he was happy, he knew.	Ha a ne a thabile, o ne a tseba.
I just exist like.	Ke teng feela joalo ka.
If you can find it.	Haeba u ka e fumana.
I like food.	Ke thabela lijo.
Just another place from home.	Sebaka se seng feela ho tloha hae.
Really good though.	Ehlile e ntle leha ho le joalo.
He is here tonight.	O teng bosiung bona.
One week is only one week.	Beke e le 'ngoe ke beke e le' ngoe feela.
If you know the way, tell us.	Haeba u tseba tsela, re bolelle.
Sometimes things go well, and sometimes they don't.	Ka linako tse ling lintho li tsamaea hantle, 'me ka linako tse ling ha li tsamaee.
This car is relatively new.	Koloi ena e batla e le ncha.
However, it is not a good idea.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se mohopolo o motle.
Do something.	Etsa ho hong.
You think a lot.	U nahana haholo.
That's not what it says.	Ha se seo e se buang.
Tomorrow morning, baby.	Hosane hoseng, ngoana.
They didn't even go and find out.	Ha ba ka ba ya le ho ya tseba.
I don't have that.	Ha ke na seo.
Everyone wants to be first.	E mong le e mong o batla ho ba oa pele.
One day his time would come.	Ka letsatsi le leng nako ea hae e ne e tla tla.
He came in just right.	A kena hantle feela.
Swimming can be fun.	Ho sesa ho ka ba monate.
Money helped, but it was not the only thing.	Chelete e ile ea thusa, empa e ne e se eona feela ntho.
I need to do this for everyone.	Ke hloka ho etsa sena bakeng sa bohle.
I hope everyone feels that way.	Ke tšepa hore bohle ba ikutloa joalo.
Seeing you and not being with you.	Ho u bona le ho se be le uena.
What's going on? 	Ho etsahalang?
he thought.	a nahana.
One reason is that we do not need it.	Lebaka le leng ke hore ha re e hloke.
They live their lives.	Ba phela bophelo ba bona.
Everyone says it well, but it’s hard.	Motho e mong le e mong o bolela hantle, empa ho thata.
I thought it was fun.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho monate.
Maybe it's just me.	Mohlomong ke 'na feela.
He used the old method of storing food.	O ne a sebelisa mokhoa oa khale oa ho boloka lijo.
I'm just at work.	Ke mosebetsing feela.
Things were not good.	Lintho li ne li se ntle.
Many people said he was joking.	Batho ba bangata ba re o ne a bapala.
He has a son.	O na le mora.
Well very early in the morning.	Hantle hoseng haholo.
We seem to have the same idea.	Ho bonahala eka re na le mohopolo o tšoanang.
We wanted to do something about that.	Re ne re batla ho etsa ho hong ka seo.
They are right about that.	Ba hantle ka seo.
I have done it many times.	Ke e entse hangata.
No one will know.	Ha ho motho ea tla tseba.
He’s right for what he wants.	O kopane hantle bakeng sa seo a se batlang.
We will have to find something else.	Re tla tlameha ho fumana ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Hard work.	Mosebetsi o boima.
He tried to keep his feelings to himself.	O ile a leka ho boloka maikutlo a hae ho eena.
I don't know anybody here.	Ha ke tsebe motho mona.
I used to do the same thing to Dad.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ho etsa ntho e tšoanang ho Ntate.
He needed to ask.	O ne a hloka ho botsa.
I knew him, but only.	Ke ile ka mo tseba, empa feela.
Of course, it was not that kind of thing.	Ehlile, e ne e se ntho ea mofuta oo.
But they didn't play it like we did.	Empa ha baa ka ba e bapala joalo ka rona.
We forget them quickly.	Re li lebala kapele.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho e etsa.
So let's not take it for a day at a time.	Kahoo ha re e nke letsatsi ka nako.
So now you can think of another.	Kahoo joale u ka nahana ka e 'ngoe.
So, I can't find it.	Ka hona, ha ke khone ho e fumana.
I have a lot of time.	Ke na le nako e ngata.
He is a great man.	Ke monna e moholo.
He loved it more this way.	O ne a e rata ho feta ka tsela ena.
It would certainly return.	Ka sebele e ne e tla khutla.
Next year, things should get better.	Selemong se tlang, lintho li lokela ho ba betere.
Very busy from today.	Ho phathahane haholo ho tsoa kajeno.
But, then, it is not a mistake.	Empa, joale, hase taba ea phoso.
I tried to tell them.	Ke ile ka leka ho ba bolella.
He also does not speak.	Le eena ha a bue.
Anything else was unthinkable.	Ntho leha e le efe e 'ngoe e ne e sa nahane.
They don't know who they are eating now.	Ha ba tsebe hore na ba ja mang jwale.
This is my hair area.	Ena ke sebaka sa ka sa moriri.
Look to the future while driving.	Sheba nakong e tlang ha u khanna.
I would have wanted to help him.	Nka be ke ile ka batla ho mo thusa.
Tell your friends about it !.	Bolella metsoalle ea hau ka eona!.
They looked like they were hurt.	Ba ne ba shebahala eka ba utloile bohloko.
But it was not enough.	Empa ho ne ho sa lekana.
They help.	Ba thusa.
He mentioned a problem.	O ile a bua ka bothata bo itseng.
That happens, often.	Seo se etsahala, hangata.
Every day.	Ka letsatsi le letsatsi.
Sleep, maybe dinner.	Robala, mohlomong lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I need everyone to do their job.	Ke hloka motho e mong le e mong a etse mosebetsi oa hae.
I see the problem.	Ke bona bothata.
I have something to look out for.	Ke na le ntho eo u lokelang ho e sheba.
Very good indeed.	Hantle haholo ruri.
And there is really not much you can do about it.	'Me ka 'nete ha ho na lintho tse ngata tseo u ka li etsang ka seo.
We also do not know what happened to you.	Le rona re ke ke ra tseba se etsahetseng ho wena.
And now we both have a lot more.	'Me joale ka bobeli re na le tse ling tse ngata.
Work fast now.	Sebetsa kapele hona joale.
Now, they do both at the same time.	Hona joale, ba etsa ka bobeli ka nako e le 'ngoe.
But it does not like what you think.	Empa ha e rate seo o se nahanang.
If you have any questions, call.	Haeba u na le lipotso, letsetsa.
It feels new.	E ikutloa e le ncha.
But he could not stand it.	Empa o ne a sitoa ho ema.
In fact, it is very good.	Ka 'nete, e ntle haholo.
Learning to ride a bike	Ho ithuta ho palama baesekele
He would like them to believe this.	A ka rata hore ba lumele sena.
Before it.	Pele ho eona.
I made breakfast for the children and took them to school.	Ke ile ka etsetsa bana lijo tsa hoseng ebe ke ea le bona sekolong.
It was a big job.	E ne e le mosebetsi o moholo.
If you look good, you will feel good.	Haeba u shebahala hantle, u tla ikutloa hantle.
My life was not mine.	Bophelo ba ka e ne e se ba ka.
Worse than the person next to everything.	E mpe ho feta motho ea haufi le ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
Why did he do so? 	Ke hobane'ng ha a ile a etsa joalo?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
Last year, however, something remarkable happened.	Leha ho le joalo, selemong se fetileng, ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang ka eona.
I mean this took some work.	Ke bolela hore sena se ile sa nka mosebetsi o itseng.
Go ahead, say it.	Tsoela pele, e bue.
It won't be long now.	Ha e sa tla ba nako e telele hona joale.
He was healthy alone.	O ne a phela hantle a le mong.
They provide food.	Ba fana ka lijo.
Eventually, though, we had a brief conversation.	Leha ho le joalo, qetellong re ile ra bua ho se hokae.
I could not want to know more.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho batla ho tseba haholoanyane.
You look nice.	O shebahala hantle.
Otherwise we will see what happens !.	Ntle le moo re tla bona hore na ho etsahalang!.
I'll get another one.	Ke tla fumana e 'ngoe.
Of course, it was not her fault.	Ke ’nete hore e ne e se molato oa hae.
Thank you for your time, and we ask this group to meet again.	Kea leboha ka nako ea hau, 'me re kopa sehlopha sena hore se kopane hape.
No, it was better.	Che, ho ne ho le betere.
I would like to know more about the place.	Ke kopa ho tseba haholoanyane ka sebaka seo.
I have no friends outside.	Ha ke na metsoalle ka ntle.
Keep looking until you find the one you like.	Tsoela pele ho sheba ho fihlela u fumana eo u e ratang.
He looked at it.	A e sheba.
Really?	Ehlile?
I don’t know much at the time.	Ha ke tsebe haholo ka nako eo.
No one else can do it.	Ha ho motho e mong ya ka e etsang.
I had no idea what had happened.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe se etsahetseng.
We will do so anyway.	Re tla etsa joalo leha ho le joalo.
I do this often.	Ke etsa sena hangata.
The water was gone.	Metsi a ne a ile.
I would like to thank him very much.	Ke rata ho mo leboha haholo.
No, he is not.	Che, ha aa lokela.
Right now, it doesn't seem important to me.	Hona joale, ha e bonahale e le bohlokoa ho 'na.
He said he needed to talk to us about it.	O ile a re ho na le seo a hlokang ho bua le rōna ka sona.
I can take that position today.	Nka nka boemo boo kajeno.
I hope you enjoy it.	Ke tšepa hore u tla e thabela.
Go to bed.	Tsa mo robala.
You can let it go.	U ka e tlohela.
Sometimes we get nothing.	Ka linako tse ling ha re fumane letho.
Of course people talk a lot.	Ehlile batho ba bua haholo.
This was my life.	Bona e ne e le bophelo ba ka.
They have a chance.	Ba na le monyetla.
It works well there.	E sebetsa hantle moo.
Say what you need to say.	Bolela seo u hlokang ho se bua.
It's getting a job.	Ke ho fumana mosebetsi.
I don't know if that will work.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hoo ho tla sebetsa.
You know that the road is empty.	Ua tseba hore tsela ha e na letho.
We will not have enough food.	Re ke ke ra ba le lijo tse lekaneng.
Wanna play.	O batla ho bapala.
They fell.	Ba ile ba oa.
Some are really good.	Tse ling li ntle haholo ruri.
Then I looked at him.	Eaba kea mo sheba.
He has no friends here.	Ha a na metsoalle mona.
Because you can write everything in one group if you want.	Hobane u ka ngola ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe ka sehlopha se le seng haeba u batla.
I did not see.	Ha kea bona.
I can't start it.	Ha ke khone ho e qala.
He will do it alone.	O tla e etsa a le mong.
They move from place to place.	Ba tloha sebakeng se seng ho ya ho se seng.
I didn't care!	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle letho!
Then we will all know you.	Ka nako eo bohle re tla o tseba.
We will find him.	Re tla mo fumana.
And it should not go there.	'Me ha ea lokela ho ea moo.
Can you write down what he said?	A na u ka ngola seo a se buileng?
He wanted to see my day.	O ne a batla ho bona letsatsi la ka.
Ask more questions.	Botsa lipotso tse ling.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
It’s actually a lot of fun, getting back to them again.	Ha e le hantle ho monate haholo, ho khutlela ho bona hape.
I didn't have to do that.	Ha kea ka ka tlameha ho etsa joalo.
These feel fast.	Tsena li ikutloa kapele.
This was not the case.	Sena se ne se sena eona.
I have a house.	Ke na le ntlo.
They knew the law.	Ba ne ba tseba molao.
There is danger.	Ho na le kotsi.
Understand that now.	Utloisisa seo ha joale.
It can't be a school.	E ke ke ea e-ba sekolo.
That passes me by.	Seo se mpheta.
It was so much fun to write.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo ho ngola.
It really was my fault.	Ehlile e ne e le phoso ea ka.
It was something he had to hear.	E ne e le ntho eo a neng a lokela ho e utloa.
But he knew that was not the reason he had passed.	Empa o ne a tseba hore ha se lebaka leo a ileng a feta.
But you don't have to stop and watch.	Empa ha o a tlameha ho ema le ho shebella.
They were close to his.	Ba ne ba le haufi le ba hae.
Don't overeat!	U se ke ua ja haholo!
He knew a lot about that.	O ne a tseba haholo ka taba eo.
You are not thinking well.	Ha o nahane hantle.
I asked several people.	Ke ile ka botsa batho ba 'maloa.
It is our job to work.	Ke mosebetsi oa rona ho sebetsa.
But it was too late.	Empa e ne e se e le morao haholo.
There was nothing there.	Ho ne ho se letho moo.
I can just have it and I want it.	Nka mpa ka ba le eona 'me 'na kea e batla.
I felt as if everyone knew in some way what had happened to me.	Ke ne ke utloa eka motho e mong le e mong o ne a tseba ka tsela e itseng hore na ho etsahetse'ng ka 'na.
And that was very difficult for me.	Mme seo se ne se le thata haholo ho nna.
Some of them are good, some are not.	Tse ling tsa tsona li ntle, tse ling ha li joalo.
Because you know it was clear we got the money.	Hobane ua tseba ho ne ho hlakile hore re fumane chelete.
There is no time to think about it.	Ha ho nako ea ho nahana ka eona.
How to get to him.	Mokhoa oa ho fihla ho eena.
I was very tired.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo.
It will not be easy.	Ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
They certainly did.	Ka sebele ba ile ba etsa joalo.
And indeed we are.	'Me ka sebele re joalo.
I don't want to meet them.	Ha ke batle ho kopana le bona.
My parents refused to attend.	Batsoali ba ka ba ile ba hana ho tla.
Learning to love too.	Ho ithuta ho rata hape.
We played well in it.	Re ile ra bapala hantle ho eona.
I will never forget it.	Ke ne nke ke ka e lebala.
It was you who wanted him.	Ke uena ea neng a mo batla.
Do this several times a day.	Etsa sena ka makhetlo a 'maloa ka letsatsi.
To be human.	Ho ba motho.
No one was looking for him.	Ho ne ho se motho ea mo batlang.
Who knows what happened.	Ke mang ea tsebang se etsahetseng.
I hope to talk to you again soon.	Ke tšepa ho bua le uena hape haufinyane.
You will meet them there.	O tla kopana le bona teng.
If it works, it works.	Haeba e sebetsa, e ea sebetsa.
Yes, he would.	E, o ne a tla etsa joalo.
This is his second book.	Ena ke buka ea hae ea bobeli.
I want that kind of life.	Ke batla bophelo ba mofuta oo.
You can never catch him.	Le ka mohla u ke ke ua mo tšoara.
Some like a little bit of time.	Ba bang ba rata hanyane ka nako.
Then we have a baby.	Ebe joale re ba le ngoana.
You were about to go to bed.	U ne u le haufi le ho robala.
To them, they visit you.	Ho bona, ba u etela.
He was not dangerous.	O ne a se kotsi.
I was not sure if that would be the case.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ho tla ba joalo.
They are in pain.	Ba utloa bohloko.
He watched the children play.	O ile a shebella bana ba bapala.
I start reading.	Ke qala ho bala.
Please correct this.	Ka kopo, lokisa sena.
Too much news is a bad thing.	Litaba tse ngata ke ntho e mpe.
Maybe for you, he can do that.	Mohlomong ho uena, a ka etsa joalo.
It should be fun.	E lokela ho ba monate.
You will need that now.	O tla hloka seo ha jwale.
He wants to talk to you.	O batla ho bua le wena.
Of course.	Ho hlakile.
Anyone with a mind will have to ask themselves this question.	Motho leha e le ofe ea nang le kelello o tla tlameha ho ipotsa potso ena.
You can even just walk away.	U ka ba ua tsamaea feela.
It's really very difficult.	Ho hlile ho thata haholo.
Reading is nothing.	Ho bala hase letho.
That's what you have to fix first.	Ke seo o lokelang ho se lokisa pele.
He was probably better than me.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe o ne a mpheta.
He did not know what he was looking for until he found it.	O ne a sa tsebe seo a neng a se batla ho fihlela a se fumana.
There was no news.	Ho ne ho se na litaba.
You should have known.	O ne o lokela ho tseba.
This was a lot.	Sena se ne se le ngata.
You are years and years old.	U na le lilemo le lilemo.
Yet that would never happen again.	Leha ho le joalo seo se ne se ke ke sa hlola se e-ba teng.
It will be better.	Ho tla ba betere.
Take a good look at this picture.	Sheba setšoantšo sena hantle.
Yet it is not an easy task.	Leha ho le joalo ha se mosebetsi o bonolo.
You can say that.	O ka bolela seo.
Apply for a job that you think you will never get.	Etsa kopo ea mosebetsi oo u nahanang hore u ke ke ua o fumana.
You will not be standing now.	Ha o sa tla hlola o ema hona joale.
Just like that and.	Feela joalo le.
I saw her for the first time.	Ke ile ka mo bona lekhetlo la pele.
That's bad stuff.	Ke ntho tse mpe.
Finally, they agreed.	Qetellong, ba ile ba lumela.
Then, finally it speaks.	Joale, qetellong ea bua.
We had a week together.	Re bile le beke re le hammoho.
They refused when we asked for help.	Ba ile ba hana ha re kōpa thuso.
No, there was only one way to fix this.	Che, ho ne ho e-na le mokhoa o le mong feela oa ho lokisa sena.
If not then it will be so.	Haeba ho se joalo ho tla ba joalo.
He loves her very much.	O mo rata haholo.
Energy is the most important factor for this.	Matla ke a bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa bakeng sa sena.
In fact, she told me that she wanted to meet my husband.	Ha e le hantle, o ile a mpolella hore o batla ho kopana le monna oa ka.
I told him about my date.	Ke ile ka mo bolella ka letsatsi la ka.
These shoes are very comfortable.	Lieta tsena li ntle haholo.
But every day was a little easier.	Empa letsatsi le leng le le leng le ne le le bonolo hanyane.
This is a family home.	Ena ke ntlo ea lelapa.
Often and now, however.	Hangata le hona joale, leha ho le joalo.
Just let them know.	Ba tsebe feela.
But he refused to call.	Empa o ile a hana ho letsa.
The man is working hard.	Monna o sebetsa ka thata.
I think that's a very good thing.	Ke nahana hore ke ntho e ntle haholo.
You never do that.	Ha ho mohla u etsang joalo.
I have what we need.	Ke na le seo re se hlokang.
Anyone with a similar problem.	Mang kapa mang ea nang le bothata bo tšoanang.
We were very happy.	Re ne re thabile haholo.
We thought this was a very difficult question.	Re ne re nahana hore ena ke potso e thata haholo.
You, you have a place to store.	Uena, u na le sebaka sa ho boloka.
I said nothing at all.	Ke ne ke sa bua letho ka nako eohle.
They do not know at all.	Ho hang ha ba tsebe.
This is not good.	Ena ha e ntle.
I know, too.	Ke a tseba, le nna.
I have no way of doing any of this.	Ha ke na mokhoa oa ho etsa leha e le efe ea sena.
It is never enough.	Ha ho mohla ho lekaneng.
Although the problem is not so simple.	Leha bothata bo se bonolo hakaalo.
He was waiting for her.	O ne a mo emetse.
It may take him longer than you expected.	E ka 'na ea mo nka nako e telele ho feta kamoo u neng u lebeletse kateng.
But he was very much like that.	Empa o ne a le joalo haholo.
We are a group.	Re sehlopha.
What is at stake here is life.	Seo se leng kotsing mona ke bophelo.
I was right with them.	Ke ne ke le hantle le bona.
However, it is.	Leha ho le joalo, ho joalo.
Before going to bed, she would read an old book.	Pele a robala, o ne a bala buka ea khale.
You can do nothing.	O ka se etse letho.
One expert to another.	Setsebi se seng ho se seng.
People were talking to me.	Batho ba ne ba bua le nna.
It can happen here.	E ka etsahala mona.
And then we know what happened.	Mme ebe rea tseba se etsahetseng.
She loves being in this group.	O rata haholo ho ba sehlopheng sena.
He left shortly thereafter.	O ile a tsamaea kapele ka mor'a moo.
Very strange feeling.	Maikutlo a makatsang haholo.
But live and learn.	Empa phela le ho ithuta.
It just has no sense of time.	E mpa feela e se na thuso ea nako.
I can say that.	Nka bolela seo.
I had to go.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
I thought maybe.	Ke ne ke nahana hore mohlomong.
You can think of me in any way.	U ka nahana ka 'na ka tsela leha e le efe.
It's easy to apply.	Ho bonolo ho kopa.
It has been a great help from them.	E bile thuso e ngata ho tsoa ho bona.
You are already using it.	U se u ntse u e sebelisa.
Maybe you want to try something else.	Mohlomong u batla ho leka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
No one thought that such a day would come.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a nahana hore letsatsi le joalo le tla tla.
You for that.	Uena bakeng sa seo.
We do not know why.	Ha re tsebe lebaka.
He had trouble finding a job.	O ne a na le bothata ba ho fumana mosebetsi.
And that did not happen.	Mme seo ha sea ka sa etsahala.
I will find out who he is again.	Ke tla fumana hore na ke mang hape.
Find the police.	Fumana mapolesa.
Sometimes they even find what they are looking for.	Ka linako tse ling ba bile ba fumana se tlang ho bona.
Nothing can happen right now.	Ha ho letho le ka etsahalang hona joale.
Or maybe he could.	Kapa mohlomong o ne a ka khona.
Well, there is only one thing.	Be, ho na le ntho e le 'ngoe feela.
Maybe it was hair.	Mohlomong e ne e le moriri.
I like it.	Ke a e rata.
Having a good time.	Ho ba le nako e monate.
Make it your own.	E etse ea hau.
I was so happy to be here, I feel so good.	Ke ne ke thabetse haholo ho ba mona, ke ikutloa hantle.
It's you.	Ke uena.
Do well.	Etsa hantle.
We can hear it all.	Re ka utloa tsohle.
If you try them and they fit, they are fine.	Haeba u li leka 'me li lekana, li ntle.
I really am.	Ke hlile ke joalo.
I can think of one way.	Nka nahana ka tsela e le 'ngoe.
As you must do.	Joalo ka ha o tlameha ho etsa joalo.
She says she doesn't like him.	O re ha a mo rate.
I had to know better.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho tseba hantle.
And it was powerful.	Mme e ne e le matla.
He was very clear about that.	O ne a hlakile haholo ka seo.
We only know if it works or not.	Re tseba feela hore na e sebetsa kapa che.
That is a question you need to ask yourself.	Eo ke potso eo ka sebele u lokelang ho ipotsa eona.
You would have found it sooner.	U ka be u fumane kapele.
You can go on and on.	U ka tsoela pele le ho ea pele.
But this is not enough.	Empa sena ha sea lekana.
I was trying to help.	Ke ne ke leka ho thusa.
I hope this is better.	Ke tšepa hore sena se betere.
But wait, there is more to it than they say.	Empa ema, ho na le ho feta kamoo ba buang kateng.
They can do what they want.	Ba ka etsa seo ba se batlang.
People here say that life without power is difficult.	Batho ba mona ba re bophelo bo se nang matla bo boima.
They are coming here.	Ba tla mona.
Everyone loved him.	Bohle ba ne ba mo rata.
He had never spent the night outside.	O ne a e-s'o ka a qeta bosiu a le ka ntle.
A car helps but it is not necessary.	Koloi e thusa empa ha e hlokahale.
It is a celebration of life.	Ke mokete wa bophelo.
And the boy will tell them.	Mme moshanyana o tla ba bolella.
And we will do it well soon.	Mme re tla e etsa hantle haufinyane.
They can see the whole book.	Ba khona ho bona buka eohle.
We are not doing that right now.	Ha re etse joalo hona joale.
This was just beginning to happen.	Sena se ne se qala ho etsahala.
If you take one thing more than another, you are wrong.	Haeba u nka ntho e itseng ho feta ntho e 'ngoe, u etsa phoso.
I found it useful to read.	Ke ile ka fumana ho le molemo ho bala.
It was a wonderful feeling.	E ne e le maikutlo a monate.
Well, some of them are.	Hantle, ba bang ba bona ba.
It is best to arrive early.	Ho molemo ho fihla kapele.
But that is his name.	Empa leo ke lebitso la hae.
He says he knows.	O re oa tseba.
They have to move on.	Ba tlameha ho ea pele.
However, as time passed, no one heard anything.	Leha ho le joalo, ha nako e ntse e feta, ha ho motho ea ileng a utloa letho.
The law is the same today.	Molao o ntse o le jwalo le kajeno.
I think of that life.	Ke nahana bophelo boo.
I hope you can help.	Ke tšepa hore u ka thusa.
But you are here, you are not going home.	Empa u teng mona, ha u ee hae.
The police were fun.	Mapolesa a ne a le monate.
Yet we have to go.	Leha ho le joalo re lokela ho tsamaea.
They do not want to work with a woman.	Ha ba batle ho sebetsa le mosali.
I can't see this.	Ha ke khone ho bona sena.
This did not happen.	Sena ha sea etsahala.
Indeed, we have found that to be so.	Ka sebele, re fumane hore ho joalo.
I hope you enjoy them !.	Ke tšepa hore u tla li thabela!.
Unable to do this in the classroom, there is not enough time.	Ha ba khone ho etsa sena ka phaposing, ha ho na nako e lekaneng.
Then he would trust her.	Joale o ne a tla mo tšepa.
Without opening the front door of your house.	Ntle le ho bula lemati le ka pele la ntlo ea hau.
Of course, of course, it does.	Ehlile, ehlile, e etsa joalo.
Where were they, he wondered.	Ba ne ba le hokae, a ipotsa.
No, there are no books after this.	Che, ha ho libuka ka mor'a sena.
Do something amazing about it.	Etsa ntho e makatsang ka eona.
She needed to be with him, to help him.	O ne a hloka ho ba le eena, ho mo thusa.
We work hard enough.	Re sebetsa ka thata ho lekana.
We did this to learn.	Re ile ra etsa sena ho ithuta.
Things were going well.	Lintho li ne li tsamaea hantle.
He wanted that very much.	O ne a batla seo haholo.
There is only one reason for this.	Ho na le lebaka le le leng feela la sena.
But that is where you know what they did.	Empa ke moo o tsebang seo ba se entseng.
We must try to understand.	Re tlameha ho leka ho utloisisa.
And it is a good thing that it should be.	'Me ke ntho e ntle haholo hore e lokela ho ba joalo.
It was always his name.	E ne e le lebitso la hae kamehla.
You will need them.	U tla li hloka.
That's the way it is now.	Ke kamoo ho leng ka teng hona joale.
I know what you can do.	Ke tseba seo o ka se khonang.
Surely, there must be something.	Ka sebele, e tlameha ebe ho na le ho hong.
It goes on and on.	E ntse e tsoela pele.
Then do more than play.	Ebe o etsa ho feta ha o bapala.
I enjoy doing things.	Ke thabela ho etsa lintho.
Parents meet with teacher.	Batsoali ba kopana le tichere.
He had work to do.	O ne a na le mosebetsi oo a lokelang ho o etsa.
You can still hear him well.	U ntse u ka mo utloa hantle.
He looked better over the years.	O ne a shebahala a le betere ho feta ka lilemo.
I mean, when he was there.	Ke bolela, ha a ne a le teng.
It can be dangerous.	E ka ba kotsi.
And it must hold people accountable.	'Me e tlameha ho tšoara batho.
The family had to move on.	Lelapa le ile la tlameha ho tsoela pele.
No one knows what to expect.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na a ka lebella eng.
Moreover, one had to be present.	Ho feta, motho o ne a tlameha ho ba teng.
We left late to talk.	Re ile ra tloha morao ho bua.
He read the book he had.	O ile a bala buka eo a neng a e-na le eona.
Maybe that was what he wanted.	Mohlomong e ne e le seo a neng a se batla.
I did not know what to do.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke etse eng.
All good.	Tsohle tse ntle.
No, you are not.	Che, ha u joalo.
From where we were, we saw no reason.	Ho tloha moo re neng re le teng, re ne re sa bone lebaka.
We could have called him yesterday.	Re ka be re ile ra mo letsetsa maobane.
And they can win.	Mme ba ka hlola.
Now we do it all together.	Hona joale re etsa tsohle hammoho.
They will find you.	Ba tla o fumana.
Of course not very good, but very bad.	Ehlile ha e ntle haholo, empa e mpe haholo.
I need to try harder.	Ke hloka ho leka ka matla.
It will never work.	E ke ke ea sebetsa le ka mohla.
I have nothing else to do, really.	Ha ke na letho le leng leo nka le etsang, ruri.
Try this.	Leka ka sena.
Thank you so much for any help.	Ke leboha haholo ka thuso efe kapa efe.
Then we both think she is a girl.	Joale ka bobeli re nahana hore ke ngoanana.
Consider another possible problem.	Nahana ka taba e 'ngoe e nang le bothata ho feta.
We look forward to seeing him again.	Re lebeletse ho mo bona hape.
The police car rang.	Koloi ea mapolesa e ile ea lla.
It was their last job.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa bona oa ho qetela.
Everyone is very close here.	Batho bohle ba haufi haholo mona.
This is what happens.	Ena ke ntho e etsahalang.
Saying it can be a challenge at times.	Ho e bua e ka ba bothata ka linako tse ling.
We were alone in the room.	Re ne re le bang ka kamoreng.
Now the police say the same thing.	Hona joale mapolesa a bua ntho e tšoanang.
He grabbed her outside her house.	A mo tšoara ka ntle ho ntlo ea hae.
So, it seems that this could work.	Ka hona, ho bonahala eka sena se ka sebetsa.
We are not sure how close we are.	Ha re tsebe hantle hore na re haufi hakae.
He does not want to see that happen again.	Ha a batle ho bona seo se etsahala hape.
So they did it.	Kahoo ba e etsa.
Try not to be overly anxious and skeptical.	Leka hore u se ke ua ba le maikutlo le ho belaela ka eona.
My mother knows better, but my father may refuse.	'Mè o tseba hantle, empa ntate a ka hana.
After that our stay went well.	Ka mor’a moo ho lula ha rōna ho ile ha tsamaea hantle.
He certainly is.	Ka sebele o joalo.
Like mine.	Joalo ka ea ka.
But we are the only ones.	Empa ke rona feela.
It was easy.	E ne e le bonolo.
Who loves water?	Ke mang ea ratang metsi?
I do that sometimes with me.	Ke etsa joalo ka linako tse ling le 'na.
Then it comes out, finally.	Ebe e a tsoa, ​​qetellong.
There are books on that.	Ho na le libuka tse buang ka seo.
Things without a book.	Lintho ntle le buka.
He studied very hard.	O ile a ithuta ka thata haholo.
Time is of the essence.	Nako e bohlokoa.
Do what you want.	Etsa seo u se batlang.
Children should play outside.	Bana ba lokela ho bapala ka ntle.
It made me think.	E entse hore ke nahane.
Asking for directions can be difficult.	Ho botsa tsela ho ka ba thata.
Until last week it was still working well.	Ho fihlela bekeng e fetileng e ntse e sebetsa hantle.
We did not have many toys.	Re ne re se na lintho tsa ho bapala tse ngata.
He likes that.	O rata seo.
Harmful story may only be true.	Taba e kotsi e ka 'na ea e-ba 'nete feela.
But not many of them understood.	Empa hase ba bangata ba bona ba ileng ba utloisisa.
We both went back.	Ka bobeli re ile ra khutlela morao.
Give what you want most.	Fana ka seo u se batlang haholo.
The good news is that you do not need them.	Litaba tse monate ke hore ha u li hloke.
Her phone rings a lot.	Mohala oa hae o lla hangata.
We get it right.	Re e fumana hantle.
But that question made her think.	Empa potso eo e ile ea etsa hore a nahane ka eona.
The children were vulnerable children.	Bana e ne e le bana ba kotsing.
Asking for money.	Ho kopa chelete.
I lived there for hours every morning.	Ke ne ke lula moo lihora tse ngata hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
However, we managed.	Leha ho le joalo, re ile ra khona.
They will pass.	Ba tla feta.
So the question is premature.	Ka hona potso ke ea pele ho nako.
Sometimes these people are our friends.	Ka linako tse ling batho bana ke metsoalle ea rōna.
And there was nobody there.	Mme ho ne ho se motho e mong moo.
He could have loved it that way.	A ka be a ile a e rata ka tsela eo.
But he did not want to leave his team.	Empa o ne a sa batle ho tlohela sehlopha sa hae.
We will have a great time.	Re tla ba le nako e monate.
Try not to stay here all night.	Leka ho se lule mona bosiu bohle.
At first glance, it seems simple.	Ha u sheba ka lekhetlo la pele, e bonahala e le bonolo.
I got to know him.	Ke ile ka mo tseba.
Before reading, think carefully.	Pele u bala, nahana ka hloko.
There is no one method that will work best for everyone.	Ha ho na mokhoa o le mong o tla sebetsa hantle bakeng sa motho e mong le e mong.
Not a good picture.	Ha se setšoantšo se setle.
He feels compelled to retire early.	O ikutloa a tlameha ho tlohela mosebetsi pele ho nako.
There is no one else like him.	Ha ho e mong ea tšoanang le eena.
I don't eat those things, no.	Ha ke je ntho tseo, che.
Or trying to.	Kapa ho leka ho.
It gives them value.	E ba fa bohlokoa.
She has no idea.	Ha a na maikutlo.
That is why he is here.	Ke ka hona a leng teng mona.
I like his mind.	Ke rata kelello ea hae.
I hope not to you.	Ke tšepa hore ha ho joalo ho uena.
He would work too.	Le eena o ne a tla sebetsa.
We will play again next year.	Re tla bapala hape selemong se tlang.
Like the last time.	Joalo ka lekhetlo la ho qetela.
Or maybe it was this one.	Kapa mohlomong e ne e le ena.
I do not do these things.	Ha ke etse lintho tsena.
It was like being a child again.	E ne eka ke ngoana hape.
But it plays out very fast.	Empa e bapala kapele haholo.
But you would not think of such a thing.	Empa u ke ke ua nahana ka ntho e joalo.
Please speak more easily.	Ke kopa o bue ka bonolo haholoanyane.
The years passed.	Lilemo li ile tsa feta.
He is indeed a great man.	Ruri ke monna e moholo.
It started to cry for them.	E ile ea qala ho lla ho bona.
Of a man who decided to live.	Ea monna ea entseng qeto ea ho phela.
He is not an individual.	Ha se motho a le mong.
But this would work.	Empa sena se ne se tla sebetsa.
But the legs and arms are very important.	Empa maoto le matsoho a bohlokoa haholo.
I would be injured.	Ke ne ke tla tsoa kotsi.
Get in there.	Kena moo.
It does not matter at all here.	Ho hang ha se taba mona.
We do not need the space we have now.	Ha re hloke sebaka seo re nang le sona hona joale.
I tried to make things right.	Ke ile ka leka ho lokisa lintho.
But he did not try hard.	Empa ha aa ka a leka ka matla.
I just need your strength more than this.	Ke hloka feela matla a hau ho feta sena.
He read a lot of books.	O ile a bala libuka tse ngata.
Thank you so much for watching.	Ke leboha haholo ka ho shebella.
Then go do it again.	Ebe o ya e etsa hape.
Too much.	E ngata haholo.
He had to say something.	O ne a lokela ho bua ho hong.
Tell us this and you can go home.	Re bolelle taba ena mme o ka ya hae.
I did not realize the time.	Ke ne ke sa hlokomela nako.
When he returned, he left.	Ha a khutla, a tsamaea.
I can't do anything about him.	Ha ke khone ho etsa letho ka eena.
He can't look at them.	A ke ke a ba sheba.
You will not be able to help your friends.	U ke ke ua khona ho thusa metsoalle ea hau.
I could not stay here when they came.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho lula mona ha ba tla.
You may be wondering why.	E ka 'na eaba ua ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha ho le joalo.
I didn’t have to go through it.	Ke ne ke sa tlameha ho feta ho eona.
However, he was not arrested that night.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a ka a tšoaroa bosiung boo.
However, it did not provide.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ea ka ea fana.
The problem is knowing the reason.	Bothata ke ho tseba lebaka.
It's not something they did before.	Ha se ntho eo ba e entseng pele.
The issue is how it works and how it works.	Taba ea eona ke hore na e sebetsa joang le hore na e sebetsa joang.
We speak without saying anything.	Re bua re sa bue letho.
But indifference to the name.	Empa ho se tsotelle lebitso.
He picked up the phone and started talking.	A nka mohala mme a qala ho bua.
I will read the whole article soon.	Ke tla bala taba ena kaofela haufinyane.
There may be one more.	Ho ka ba le e 'ngoe hape.
I was the only one who did that.	Ke 'na feela ea kileng a etsa joalo.
For something as simple as this.	Bakeng sa ntho e bonolo joalo ka ena.
The man is a teacher.	Monna ke tichere.
If he did, he would lose all trust in him.	Haeba a ne a tsamaea, o ne a ke ke a hlola a mo tšepa.
There are many of us.	Ho na le ba bangata ba rona.
He is a very big man.	Ke motho e moholo haholo.
He never did it again.	Ha a ka a hlola a e etsa.
I want to know better.	Ke batla ho tseba hantle.
Or who spoke to him, for that matter.	Kapa ke mang ea buileng le eena, bakeng sa taba eo.
I'm done.	Ke qetile.
He was very nice.	O ne a le monate haholo.
Because we used to be very close together.	Hobane re kile ra ba hammoho haholo.
They never did.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba etsa joalo.
I have never met anyone.	Ha ke eso kopane le e mong.
Anyone who knows who he is.	E mong le e mong ea tsebang hore na o mang.
There can be no.	Ho ka se be teng.
I think you have to start there.	Ke nahana hore u tlameha ho qala moo.
With his hands.	Ka matsoho a hae.
When asking a question, please do not speak too fast.	Ha u ntse u botsa potso, ka kopo u se ke ua bua kapele haholo.
And that's what this is all about.	Mme ke sona seo sena se buang ka sona.
I am not that person.	Ha ke motho eo.
They did something better.	Ba entse ho hong ho betere.
I mean the player.	Ke bolela sebapali.
Family was important to him.	Lelapa e ne e le la bohlokoa ho eena.
What he was saying was clear.	Seo a neng a se bolela se ne se hlakile.
To tell you this.	Ho o bolella sena.
Good for him.	Molemo ho eena.
But it is not near.	Empa ha e haufi.
You just don’t know because it’s a fall.	U mpa u sa tsebe hobane ke ho oa.
Tell him what happened.	Mo bolelle se etsahetseng.
We must continue to work.	Re tlameha ho tsoela pele ho sebetsa.
You have an opinion.	U na le maikutlo.
The phone was always ringing.	Mohala o ne o lla kamehla.
It was fun.	Ho ne ho le monate.
He asked her a lot of questions.	O ile a mo botsa lipotso tse ngata haholo.
And work is work.	Mme mosebetsi ke mosebetsi.
And it continues to do so today.	'Me e ntse e tsoela pele ho etsa joalo le kajeno.
Valuable money !.	Ea bohlokoa chelete!.
I don’t understand why everyone has to drive.	Ha ke utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha bohle ba tlameha ho khanna.
What kind of person was he?	E ne e le motho oa mofuta ofe?
Help came quickly.	Thuso e ile ea tla kapele.
I want to write a book.	Ke batla ho ngola buka.
He looked at his phone.	A sheba mohala wa hae.
I did not understand.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise.
Then start thinking about how.	Ebe u qala ho nahana kamoo.
Even if they don't know it.	Leha ba sa e tsebe.
I had a great time, though.	Ke bile le nako e monate, leha ho le joalo.
Of course, it does not matter to you, but.	Ha e le hantle, hase taba ea bohlokoa ho uena, empa .
Life is Beautiful!	Bophelo bo monate!
I will try that in the future.	Ke tla leka seo nakong e tlang.
That's the danger.	Ke kotsi eo.
Not so with him, apparently.	Le eena ha a joalo, ho bonahala.
Whether he talked to any friends at the time.	Hore na o ile a bua le metsoalle leha e le efe ka nako eo.
I am not one of them.	Ha ke e mong oa bona.
However, I hope he does not.	Leha ho le joalo, ke tšepa hore a ke ke a etsa joalo.
I can't trust him.	Ha ke khone ho mo tšepa.
Just not so easy.	Feela ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
Of course, you don't have to be alone with me.	Ha e le hantle, ha ua lokela ho ba mong le 'na.
You know what you're going to have to write.	U tseba seo u tla tlameha ho se ngola.
Maybe more than that.	Mohlomong ho feta moo.
It told him they were close.	E ile ea mo bolella hore ba haufi.
I didn't even look at it.	Ha kea ka ka e sheba le ho e sheba.
Everyone seems to be doing the same thing.	Ho bonahala batho bohle ba etsa se tšoanang.
That's what hair does.	Ke seo moriri o se etsang.
What do you know about family or friends?	U tseba eng ka lelapa kapa metsoalle?
You may get to a point where you no longer need it.	U ka 'na ua fihla moo u seng u sa e hloke.
It can be dangerous to sleep very late at night.	Ho ka ba kotsi ho robala bosiu haholo.
Why, we can do anything.	Hobaneng, re ka etsa eng kapa eng.
Doing this is easier said than done.	Ho etsa sena ho bonolo ho feta kamoo o ka nahanang.
My father refused to believe me.	Ntate o ne a hana ho lumela.
In the same way with his mother.	Ka tsela e tšoanang le 'mè oa hae.
We must be helpful.	Re tlameha ho ba le thuso.
We still do not know who he is.	Re ntse re sa tsebe le hore na ke mang.
But, now, that's the point.	Empa, joale, taba ke eona eo.
Before you leave.	Pele u tsamaea .
I did not mention the dog.	Ha kea bua ka ntja.
We have a lot of food.	Re na le lijo tse ngata.
Who would have thought that we would see one of them.	Ke mang ea neng a ka nahana hore re tla bona e mong oa bona.
To be sure.	Ho ba le bonnete.
And look carefully.	Mme sheba hantle.
But he was not the only one.	Empa e ne e se eena feela.
And problems began to appear.	Mme mathata a ne a qala ho bonahala.
Of course we never talked about this.	Ehlile ha ho mohla re kileng ra bua ka taba ena.
I couldn’t do without it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho etsa ntle le eona.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
I did not think so.	Ke ne ke sa nahane joalo.
But you can understand.	Empa u ka utloisisa.
You know what it was like.	Ua tseba hore na ho ne ho le joang.
The man was arrested by local police.	Monna eo o ile a tšoaroa ke mapolesa a moo.
It was useless, he could not decide.	Ho ne ho se na thuso, o ne a ke ke a etsa qeto.
How things go is very important to us.	Hore na lintho li tsamaea joang ho bohlokoa haholo ho rona.
But there was more to come.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ho tlang.
I thought she should get help.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o lokela ho fumana thuso.
At one point he saw someone like him.	Ka nako e ’ngoe o ile a bona motho ea tšoanang le eena.
He knew he was giving her a chance to get everything.	O ne a tseba hore o mo fa monyetla oa ho fumana ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
Thanks for all your help!	Kea leboha ka thuso ea hau eohle!
This is what he expected.	Sena ke seo a neng a se lebeletse.
This is actually a real place.	Ha e le hantle sena ke sebaka sa sebele.
It's beautiful.	E ntle.
However, he does not do any of that here.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a etse letho la seo mona.
I know it's time for us to talk.	Kea tseba hore ke nako ea hore re bue.
Could you.	A na u ka.
I 'do'.	Ke 'na' ea e etsang.
Hopefully it will be better than the last.	Tšepa hore e tla ba betere ho feta ea ho qetela.
Keep reading it.	Tsoela pele ho e bala.
There were others, perhaps, who did.	Ho ne ho e-na le ba bang, mohlomong, ba ileng ba etsa joalo.
She was already very beautiful.	O ne a se a le motle haholo.
He knows that.	O tseba seo.
That is why he is here.	Ke ka hona a leng teng mona.
Open space.	Bula sebaka.
She had a child with him.	O ne a e-na le ngoana le eena.
One meal, please.	Lijo tse le 'ngoe ka kopo.
I am no longer needed here.	Ha ke sa hlokahala mona.
Everyone was there.	Bohle ba ne ba le teng.
She still has hair.	O ntse a na le moriri.
Sleep longer.	Robala nako e telele.
I did both of those things.	Ke ne ke etsa lintho tseo ka bobeli.
I say the time is now.	Ke re nako ke hona joale.
Please finish your dinner.	Ka kopo, qeta lijo tsa hau tsa mantsiboea.
He looked up, expecting.	A sheba, a lebella.
No one else did.	Ha ho motho e mong ea ileng a etsa joalo.
He was done.	O ne a qetile.
I really don't.	Ha ke hlile ha ke joalo.
He was going home.	O ne a tla ea hae.
You will never get a job again.	O ka se fumane mosebetsi hape.
If not, you may not be able to get many.	Haeba ho se joalo, u ka 'na ua se ke ua khona ho fumana tse ngata.
There can certainly be others.	Ka sebele ho ka ba le ba bang.
But everything looked good, everything looked good.	Empa ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e ne e shebahala hantle, tsohle li ne li shebahala hantle.
But this was the first time they had seen anything like it.	Empa ba ne ba qala ho bona ntho e kang ena.
Then he gave her a hug.	Eaba o mo fa monate.
Instead of writing, they spoke.	Ho e-na le ho ngola, ba ile ba bua.
So everything is more alive to me.	Kahoo ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e phela haholoanyane ho 'na.
Continue with the question of why.	Tsoela pele ka potso ea hore na hobaneng.
That is no longer the case.	Taba eo ha e sa le taba.
They are the first to arrive.	Ke bona ba pele ba ho fihla.
I'll come with you, if that's what you want.	Ke tla tla le uena, haeba ke seo u se batlang.
And, now, something wonderful is starting to happen.	Mme, jwale, ntho e monate e qala ho etsahala.
It can be difficult at times.	Ho ka ba thata ka linako tse ling.
He wondered where he was tonight.	A ipotsa hore na ebe o kae bosiung bona.
The image still exists today.	Setšoantšo se ntse se le teng le kajeno.
It was something to them.	E ne e le ntho e itseng ho bona.
We really enjoyed our meal.	Re ne re thabela lijo tsa rōna haholo.
But this is very interesting.	Empa sena se monate haholo.
I'm not sure how long this will take.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na sena se tla nka nako e kae.
That is where the accident took place.	Ke hona moo kotsi e etsahetseng teng.
It was such a close call.	E ne e le mohala o haufi hakaalo.
That way, no one would see you.	Ka tsela eo, ho ne ho se motho ea tla u bona.
I wondered if he did the same with other people.	Ke ne ke ipotsa hore na o ne a etsa joalo le batho ba bang.
I still want this.	Ke ntse ke batla sena.
Maybe they were there.	Mohlomong ba ne ba le teng.
Somehow.	Ka tsela e itseng.
Some people will have other ideas.	Batho ba bang ba tla ba le maikutlo a mang.
That's what they want.	Ke seo ba se batlang.
They did the same thing.	Ba entse sona seo.
I was really unsure.	Ke ne ke hlile ke se na bonnete.
I can tell you right.	Nka u bolella hantle.
Can anyone do that.	Na ho na le motho ea ka etsang joalo.
Which was probably my first mistake.	Eo mohlomong e neng e le phoso ea ka ea pele.
Talking to people.	Ho bua le batho.
That's right, even more so.	Ho joalo, le ho feta.
The bad news is.	Litaba tse mpe ke.
But then he leaves.	Empa joale oa tsamaea.
As far as we know, though.	Ho ea kamoo re tsebang, leha ho le joalo.
From day one.	Ho tloha ka letsatsi le le leng.
I've always thought about it myself.	Le 'na esale ke nahana ka eona.
There are some good things here.	Ho na le lintho tse ntle mona.
However, that is not the only issue.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se eona feela taba eo.
It's nice to meet old friends again.	Ho monate ho kopana le metsoalle ea khale hape.
That made it even more fun.	Seo se ile sa etsa hore e be monate le ho feta.
He said.	A re .
Stop and talk !.	Ema o bue!.
The situation is very strong.	Boemo bo matla haholo.
However, it was caught.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ile ha tšoaroa.
My son is there.	Mora oa ka o teng.
Well, that's what it says here.	Be, ke seo e se buang mona.
They would eat well.	Ba ne ba tla ja hantle.
There was nobody here.	Ho ne ho se motho mona.
She cries.	O lla.
All it can be.	Sohle seo e ka bang sona.
Although they are often real, many are not.	Le hoja hangata e le tsa sebele, tse ngata ha li joalo.
Why exactly.	Ke hobane'ng ha e le hantle.
This can take time, a week or more.	Sena se ka nka nako, beke kapa ho feta.
That would never happen again.	Taba eo e ne e ke ke ea hlola e etsahala hape.
I believed that was the truth he was telling me.	Ke ne ke lumela hore ke ’nete eo a neng a mpolella eona.
I had enough to keep going.	Ke ne ke na le ho lekaneng ho tsoela pele.
I will be close to you.	Ke tla ba haufi le uena.
I start to wonder.	Ke qala ho ipotsa.
What was happening really came to him.	Se neng se etsahala se ne se hlile se fihla ho eena.
Work can stop.	Mosebetsi o ka ema.
I go this way.	Ke ea ka tsela ena.
It was not in one of them.	E ne e se ho e ’ngoe ea tsona.
You will see them in the end.	U tla ba bona qetellong.
Food arrived quickly.	Lijo li ile tsa fihla kapele.
Lots of good ones.	Tse ngata tse ntle.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
You have not left.	Ha o eso tsamaee.
The letter came while he was on duty.	Lengolo le ile la tla ha a ntse a le mosebetsing.
It's too long.	Ke nako e telele haholo.
Mainly because he was there.	Haholo hobane o ne a le teng.
He did a great job.	O entse mosebetsi o motle.
Anything would help.	Ntho efe kapa efe e ne e tla thusa.
Some people are not like that.	Batho ba bang ha ba joalo.
Yes, yes, there is.	E, e, ho na le.
I did the same thing before, it works well.	Ke entse ntho e tšoanang pele, e sebetsa hantle.
Which made me think even more.	E leng se ileng sa etsa hore ke nahane ho feta.
She is very happy.	O thabile haholo.
They want to know how to get out.	Ba batla ho tseba hore na ba ka tsoa joang.
She was even more beautiful.	O ne a le motle ho feta.
i love you	kea u rata
He understands the issues.	O utloisisa litaba.
I have to finish this soon.	Ke tlameha ho qeta sena haufinyane.
But no one saw him.	Empa ha ho motho ea ileng a mo bona.
Do you feel like coming ?.	Na u ikutloa u tla?.
But that doesn't work anymore.	Empa hoo ha ho sa sebetsa.
Of course, anything.	Ha e le hantle, ntho leha e le efe.
They usually come out only at night.	Hangata li tsoa bosiu feela.
They have nothing.	Ha ba na letho.
It has to be something that people will pay for.	E tlameha ho ba ntho eo batho ba tla e lefa.
He left.	A tloha.
The same thing could happen to humans.	Ntho e tšoanang e ka sebetsa le ho batho.
I will not be here this morning.	Ha ke na ho ba mona hoseng.
This was a very good practice.	Ena e ne e le mokhoa o motle haholo.
I didn't think anything of it at the time.	Ke ne ke sa nahane letho ka eona ka nako eo.
I can only make a few comments here.	Nka etsa maikutlo a 'maloa feela mona.
There was no one else around.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong haufi.
He did not know what his father was like.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ntate oa hae o joang.
This is exactly the time and place.	Sena ke hantle nako le sebaka.
But that was not very often.	Empa hoo e ne e se hangata haholo.
Well, it was something.	Be, e ne e le ntho e itseng.
We don't have time for that right now.	Ha re na nako ea seo ha joale.
And they know about me.	Mme ba tseba ka nna.
We have to move fast.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea kapele.
Of course, it is important.	Ehlile, ho bohlokoa.
Get away from you.	Tloha ho uena.
The children were still in school.	Bana ba ne ba ntse ba le sekolong.
Make sure you do not do it all at once.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u se ke ua e etsa ka nako e le 'ngoe.
And how he wants to live.	Le kamoo a batlang ho phela teng.
I'm still there.	Ke ntse ke le teng.
No one knows where he is.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang moo a leng teng.
Just exactly how it happened.	Hantle feela kamoo ho etsahetseng kateng.
This works well.	Sena se sebetsa hantle.
Thanks for dinner.	Ke leboha lijo tsa mantsiboea.
We had to catch them first.	Re ile ra tlameha ho li tšoara pele.
It was an easy decision to make.	E ne e le qeto e bonolo ho e etsa.
It will help you.	E tla u thusa.
Or they were there.	Kapa ba ne ba le teng.
I don't know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke efe.
I wanted to tell you.	Ke ne ke batla ho o bolella.
But you did not know.	Mme o ne o sa tsebe.
It is very powerful.	E matla haholo.
Don't forget to reuse.	Se ke oa lebala ho sebelisa hape.
Think about it.	Nahana ka eona.
He has his mother.	O na le mme wa hae.
We found everything good.	Re fumane tsohle li le ntle.
He wants to buy them.	O batla ho li reka.
They, too, had received nothing.	Le bona ba ne ba sa fumane letho.
But too many are.	Empa ba bangata haholo ba joalo.
She looked at him for the first time, and it helped.	O ile a mo sheba ka lekhetlo la pele, 'me ho ile ha thusa.
That is the law.	Ke molao oo.
Is it necessary?	Na hoa hlokahala?
It is best for everyone.	E molemo ka ho fetisisa bakeng sa motho e mong le e mong.
He has always been.	Haesale a le jwalo.
We too have had to comment since then.	Le rona re ile ra tlameha ho fana ka maikutlo ho tloha ka nako eo.
For food or clothing.	Bakeng sa lijo kapa liaparo.
Water here is very dangerous to drink.	Metsi mona a kotsi haholo ho a noa.
I'm still looking for a way out.	Ke ntse ke batla tsela ea ho tsoa.
And, if nothing else, you have to love the name.	'Me, haeba ho se letho le leng, u tlameha ho rata lebitso.
That is what life is all about.	Ke seo bophelo bo leng sona.
His mother knew.	Mme wa hae o ne a tseba.
We are equal.	Re a lekana.
He felt better.	O ile a ikutloa a le betere.
The same is true of all others.	Ho joalo le ka ba bang kaofela.
I have a lot of money and power and strength.	Ke na le chelete e ngata le matla le matla.
Healthy than walking.	Ho phela hantle ho feta ho tsamaea.
But sometimes you will have to.	Empa ka linako tse ling u tla tlameha.
You do not know what the accident might do.	Ha o tsebe hore na kotsi e ka etsa eng.
All that is good for us.	Tsohle tse molemo ho rona.
It was about this time that his mother died.	Ke hoo e ka bang ka nako ena moo ’mè oa hae a ileng a hlokahala.
It also provides food.	E fana ka lijo hape.
So sleep, my child,	Kahoo robala, ngoana oa ka,
I think about it here.	Ke nahana ka mona.
It is not that difficult in reality.	Ha ho thata hakaalo ka 'nete.
He thought he knew.	O ne a nahana hore oa tseba.
There is no such thing here.	Mona ha ho ntho e joalo e teng.
First issue, bad news.	Taba ea pele, litaba tse mpe.
I tested him at work and he was absent, so.	Ke ile ka mo leka mosebetsing mme o ne a le sieo, kahoo.
But we know what.	Empa re tseba eng.
The same is true of all others.	Ho joalo le ka ba bang kaofela.
I will leave it at that.	Ke tla e tlohela joalo.
I asked him what he was going to do.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na o il’o etsa’ng.
Sometimes the same room would have been in the past.	Ka linako tse ling kamore e tšoanang e ka be e bile nakong e fetileng.
If he had been there, he would not have left.	Haeba a ne a ka ba teng, a ka be a sa ka a tsamaea.
They just don't do it.	Ha ba e etse feela.
It is definitely better to be both.	Ka sebele ho molemo ho ba bobeli.
In one bedroom, we were both looking for children.	Kamore e 'ngoe ea ho robala, ka bobeli re ne re batla bana.
And he was there.	Mme o ne a le teng.
We had to move on.	Re ile ra tlameha ho tsoela pele.
I really needed him right away.	Ke ne ke hlile ke mo hloka hona hoo.
What time do you think you will arrive?	U nahana ho fihla ka nako mang?
They can do whatever they want.	Ba ka etsa eng kapa eng eo ba e batlang.
If they wanted to get something out of him, they could.	Haeba ba ne ba batla ho fumana ho hong ho tsoa ho eena, ba ne ba ka khona.
You can fix this.	O ka lokisa sena.
But it looks good.	Empa e shebahala hantle.
Yes, it means today.	E, ho bolela kajeno.
But it is better.	Empa ho molemo.
We will need to watch it to think about it.	Re tla hloka ho e shebella hore re e nahane.
Of course it can take a long time.	Ehlile ho ka nka nako e telele.
But that was all in the future.	Empa seo sohle se ne se le nakong e tlang.
Tell him what to do.	Mo bolelle seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
But keeping him up until then can be difficult.	Empa ho mo boloka ho fihlela ka nako eo ho ka 'na ha e-ba thata.
It's not hard for me.	Ha ho thata ho nna.
You have to help us.	U tlameha ho re thusa.
People can come to my father any way they want '.	Batho ba ka tla ho ntate ka tsela efe kapa efe eo ba e batlang'.
I finally heard it from another woman.	Qetellong ke ile ka e utloa ho mosali e mong.
Swim too fast.	Ho sesa kapele haholo.
The house was empty.	Ntlo e ne e se na motho.
He is a strange man.	Ke motho ya makatsang.
Just be yourself.	E-ba uena feela.
And it should not come from you.	Hape ha ea lokela ho tsoa ho uena.
Were they real?	E ne e le tsa 'nete?
But do well.	Empa etsa hantle.
But it is their decision that they must make.	Empa ke qeto ea bona eo ba lokelang ho e etsa.
Although this is a dangerous approach.	Leha ena e le tsela e kotsi.
Maybe it would be better if they did.	Mohlomong ho ka ba molemo ha ba ka etsa joalo.
I want to watch.	Ke batla ho shebella.
I doubted he could say the same thing.	Ke ne ke belaela hore le eena a ka bua joalo.
I mean, you know.	Ke bolela, ua tseba.
Here is the point.	Taba ke ena.
Get your stuff, he says.	Fumana lintho tsa hau, o re.
Sometimes time stops.	Ka nako e 'ngoe nako ea ema.
There is still room to pass.	Ho sa na le sebaka sa ho feta.
It was a wonderful family day !.	E ne e le letsatsi le monate la lelapa!.
It was just fun.	Ho ile ha feta monate feela.
Busy with less important things.	Ho phathahane ka lintho tse seng tsa bohlokoa hakaalo.
Why did he keep it? 	Ke hobane'ng ha a ne a e boloka?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
You may have found him with my help.	Ho ka etsahala hore u mo fumane ka thuso ea ka.
But, it happened.	Empa, ho ile ha etsahala.
However, he continued.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a tsoela pele.
They can have a week.	Ba ka ba le beke.
However, we both knew the truth.	Leha ho le joalo, ka bobeli re ne re tseba 'nete.
It did not take him long to find her.	Ha hoa ka ha nka nako e telele ho mo fumana.
Certainly first aid is needed.	Ka sebele thuso ea pele ea hlokahala.
He lived a difficult life.	O ile a phela bophelo bo thata.
However, it was useless.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se na thuso.
He learns quickly.	O ithuta kapele.
They would not know where he was going.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba tseba moo a ileng teng.
Driving is very dangerous.	Ho khanna ho kotsi haholo.
It's just his life.	Ke ho phela ha hae feela.
We are moving forward carefully.	Re ntse re tsoela pele ka hloko.
His true personality.	Motho oa hae oa 'nete.
They have it there.	Ba na le eona moo.
I had the best time ever.	Ke bile le nako e monate ka ho fetisisa.
I'll think about it.	Ke tla e nahana.
They had some power.	Ba ne ba e-na le matla a itseng.
Note that it is important that.	Hlokomela hore ho bohlokoa hore.
I do not want to understand.	Ha ke batle ho utloisisa.
Where do you live?	U lula kae?
We can fix it.	Re ka e lokisa.
We really do not need any of them.	Ruri ha re hloke leha e le efe ya tsona.
All about the dog.	Tsohle ka ntja.
It was very important for that.	E ne e le ea bohlokoa haholo bakeng sa seo.
I also refuse to eat.	Ke hana le ho ja.
No one asked for it.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a e kōpa.
That's the new way.	Ke eona tsela e ncha.
It should be very fun.	E lokela ho ba monate haholo.
The man could help but he was not sure.	Monna a ka thusa empa o ne a sa tsebe hantle.
I thought about my situation.	Ke ile ka nahana ka boemo ba ka.
She thought she must be happy.	O ne a nahana hore e tlameha ebe o ikutloa a thabile.
Then he would not know why.	Joale o ne a ke ke a tseba lebaka.
If they are, they make them easy.	Haeba li le teng, li etsa hore li be bonolo.
School is a place of learning.	Sekolo ke sebaka sa ho ithuta.
His life was in danger.	Bophelo ba hae bo ne bo le kotsing.
This was the line he had been waiting for.	Ena e ne e le mohala oo esale a o emetse.
They talked a lot in the morning.	Ba ne ba bua haholo hoseng.
There were no police officers at the time.	Ho ne ho se na mapolesa ka nako eo.
The house has been empty for years.	Ntlo eo e se e le lilemo e se na motho.
The team was doing well.	Sehlopha se ne se sebetsa hantle.
When I look at you, I love you even more.	Ha ke o sheba, ke o rata le ho feta.
His, too.	Ea hae, le eona.
He would have to think about this for a long time.	O ne a tla tlameha ho nahana ka sena nako e telele.
Make no mistake about it.	U se ke ua etsa phoso 'na.
The day is very pleasant.	Letsatsi le monate haholo.
No one else can.	Ha ho motho e mong ea ka khonang.
You don't want to call anyone.	Ha o batle ho letsetsa mang kapa mang.
We are his team.	Re sehlopha sa hae.
I don't even know how to get them.	Ha ke tsebe le mokhoa oa ho li fumana.
That player was really good.	Sebapali seo se ne se le setle haholo.
There is no room for that here.	Haho sebaka sa seo mona.
That was the only time we could meet.	Ke nako feela eo re neng re ka kopana.
I had another reason to come.	Ke ne ke e-na le lebaka le leng la ho tla.
Now, he did not know what he had done.	Joale, o ne a sa tsebe seo a se entseng.
You will enjoy it.	O tla e thabela.
Only regular.	Ea kamehla feela.
It looks good.	E shebahala e le ntle.
We saw the children at the party	Re bone bana moketeng
And it's hard to overcome that.	Mme ho thata ho hlola jwalo.
He would know it when he saw it.	O ne a tla e tseba ha a e bona.
I like the style of their writing.	Ke rata mokhoa oa ho ngola oa tsona.
Or you may think.	Kapa u ka nahana.
He will be great.	O tla ba moholo.
Writing is hard at the best of times.	Ho ngola ho thata ka linako tse molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Make friends while you are here.	Etsa metsoalle ha u ntse u le mona.
He said he had it.	O ile a re o na le eona.
We will find out soon.	Re tla tseba haufinyane.
We just got back.	Re sa tsoa khutla.
It finally came out.	Qetellong ea tsoa.
Was it you?	E ne e le uena?
His approach is very simple.	Mokhoa oa hae o bonolo haholo.
We were fine together, but we were just kids.	Re ne re le hantle hammoho, empa re ne re le bana feela.
We can talk about it.	Re ka bua ka eona.
By then it would have been too late.	Ka nako eo e ne e tla be e se e le morao haholo.
Again, nothing happened there again.	Hape, ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala moo hape.
He takes the situation very seriously.	O nka boemo boo e le ba bohlokoa haholo.
We need things to do in that area.	Re hloka lintho tseo re lokelang ho li etsa sebakeng seo.
So never say never !.	Kahoo le ka mohla u se ke ua re ha ho mohla!.
Let's go to your bedroom.	Ha re ee kamoreng ea hau ea ho robala.
One was good.	E 'ngoe e ne e le ntle.
Very, very well.	Haholo, hantle haholo.
You can usually do as you please.	Hangata u ka etsa kamoo u ratang kateng.
He had many things to think about.	O ne a e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a ka nahanang ka tsona.
If you do not, then you have a problem.	Haeba u sa etse joalo, joale u na le bothata.
You may be one of them.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe u e mong oa bona.
It was not so true.	E ne e se 'nete hakaalo.
Of course, you can do that.	Ha e le hantle, u ka etsa joalo.
He was a good boy.	E ne e le moshanyana e motle.
He does not speak often.	Ha a bue hangata.
They talked for a long time.	Ba ile ba bua nako e telele.
They knew it well.	Ba ne ba tseba hantle.
Maybe together we can understand this.	Mohlomong hammoho re ka utloisisa taba ena.
She seems to think it's my fault.	Ho bonahala a nahana hore ke molato oa ka.
You are my boy.	U moshanyana oa ka.
Soon, he would return home.	Haufinyane, o ne a tla khutlela hae.
So, that made me think.	Kahoo, seo se ile sa etsa hore ke nahane.
I expect the same from you.	Ke lebeletse se tšoanang ho uena.
Their content is important.	Litaba tsa bona li bohlokoa.
But you would love it.	Empa u ne u tla e rata.
I was tired of it.	Ke ne ke khathetse ke eona.
There is nothing.	Ha ho letho le leng teng.
It will start working.	E tla qala ho sebetsa.
Obviously you will read well.	Ho hlakile hore o tla bala hantle.
And then the whole school will know.	Mme ebe sekolo sohle se tla tseba.
This coffee is very strong.	Kofi ena e matla haholo.
Some work was easy.	Mosebetsi o mong o ne o le bonolo.
But he thought about them.	Empa o ile a nahana ka tsona.
It's useless.	Ha e na thuso.
This makes it important to me.	Sena se etsa hore e be ea bohlokoa ho 'na.
But perhaps they did not want to.	Empa mohlomong ba ne ba sa batle ho etsa joalo.
I like this one too.	Ke rata le ena.
How both of them know.	Hore na bobeli ba bona ba tseba joang.
I will give her something to take home with her.	Ke tla mo fa ho hong hore a ee le eena hae.
I hope you all have a wonderful life.	Ke tšepa hore bohle le na le bophelo bo monate.
The police found nothing.	Mapolesa ha aa ka a fumana letho.
Everyone stayed, except me.	Bohle ba ile ba dula, ntle le nna.
Me, and many others in my year.	Nna, le ba bang ba bangata selemong sa ka.
When you want it.	Ha o e batla.
It was not only a job for him, but it was also fun.	E ne e se mosebetsi feela ho eena, empa hape e ne e le monate.
He had done it for a very long time.	O ne a e entse nako e telele haholo.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho joalo.
I will go to him.	Ke tla ea ho eena.
That's when he realized he wanted to talk.	Ke moo a ileng a hlokomela hore o batla ho bua.
You can't tell me where to live and where not to live.	U ke ke ua mpolella hore na ke lule hokae le hore na ke se lule hokae.
There is only one person who can be like that.	Ho na le motho a le mong feela ea ka bang joalo.
Some children like to play outside.	Bana ba bang ba rata ho bapala ka ntle.
You don't have to think anything.	Ha ua lokela ho nahana letho.
He did not do that, because he cares for his family.	Ha aa ka a etsa joalo, hobane o hlokomela lelapa la hae.
I knew nothing.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe letho.
He was looking forward to being here for some time.	O ne a lebeletse ho ba mona ka nako e itseng.
Found nothing wrong.	Ha ea fumana letho le phoso.
Then I call mom and dad.	Ebe ke letsetsa mme le ntate.
I will get it from him in the end.	Ke tla e fumana ho eena qetellong.
He had spent the night.	O ne a qetile bosiu.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
It's always been about you.	Haesale e le ka wena.
The same is true of us.	Ho joalo le ka rona.
And think about it.	'Me u nahane ka eona.
He just exists.	O teng feela.
Some days you feel better than others.	Ka matsatsi a mang u ikutloa u le betere ho feta a mang.
Yes of course.	Ehlile ho joalo.
He stopped.	A ema.
He would do that.	O ne a tla etsa joalo.
You have to learn to eat.	U tlameha ho ithuta ho ja.
Day, you asked what they wanted.	Letsatsi, u ile ua botsa hore na ba batla eng.
I find you.	Ke u fumana.
That is what he would do.	Ke sona seo a neng a tla se etsa.
It's my job.	Ke mosebetsi oa ka.
I'm looking for him here.	Ke mo batla mona.
They are living at that time.	Ba phela nakong eo.
I'm happy for him.	Ke mo thabetse.
I just wanted a dog.	Ke ne ke batla ntja feela.
Today was fun.	Kajeno e ne e le monate.
I have seen my wife and my son.	Ke bone mosali oa ka le mora oa ka.
The first way.	Tsela ea pele.
He wants to save water.	O batla ho boloka metsi.
Now we go on, or not.	Jwale re ya pele, kapa ho seng jwalo.
He was playing at the time for his team.	O ne a bapala ka nako eo bakeng sa sehlopha sa hae.
Stay close to me.	Dula haufi le nna.
And they loved him.	Mme le bona ba ne ba mo rata.
I have to go.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
He works very well.	O sebetsa hantle haholo.
Though he will not be.	Leha a ke ke a ba teng.
Please help.	Ke kopa ho thusa.
I want to go.	Ke batla ho tsamaea.
He worked well.	O ne a sebetsa hantle.
We should not do that here.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho etsa joalo mona.
I am here to stay.	Ke mona ho dula.
Everything he does, he does well.	Sohle seo a se etsang, o se etsa hantle.
I think you should go to him one last time.	Ke nahana hore u lokela ho ea ho eena lekhetlo la ho qetela.
I took her too.	Le nna ke ile ka mo nka.
Thanks for trying.	Kea leboha ka ho leka.
See his parents.	Bona batsoali ba hae.
You know, a very good thing.	Ua tseba, ntho e ntle haholo.
But it is not.	Empa ha se eona.
It happens in the past.	E etsahala nakong e fetileng.
They both have strong hands.	Ka bobeli li na le matsoho a matla.
I am with him.	Ke na le eena.
But he does not.	Empa ha a etse jwalo.
I enjoyed it.	Ke ile ka e thabela.
I still can.	Ke ntse ke khona.
You might agree that they are.	U ka ’na ua lumela hore mohlomong ba joalo.
And so it is, but it is hard to find.	'Me ho joalo, empa ho thata ho fumana.
But it was last year.	Empa e ne e le selemong se fetileng.
I hope to enjoy you again.	Ke tla tšepa ho u thabela hape.
You can do this job if you really try.	U ka etsa mosebetsi ona haeba u hlile u leka.
It's fun to look at things.	Ho monate ho sheba lintho.
They had supreme power.	Ba ne ba e-na le matla a phahameng.
We treat it was not.	Re tšoara e ne e se eona.
Here, there was none.	Mona, ho ne ho se na.
It was about everything.	E ne e le ka tsohle.
His name.	Lebitso la hae.
Surely there are others just like you.	Ka sebele ho na le ba bang ba tšoanang le uena.
It was my first job.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa ka oa pele.
I did not want to hear anything.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho utloa letho.
I love her and her other problems.	Ke rata le mathata a hae a mang.
That was his job.	Oo e ne e le mosebetsi oa hae.
He will never ask you again.	A ke ke a hlola a o botsa.
I looked around the room.	Ka sheba ka phaposing.
She cried emotionally.	O ile a lla ka maikutlo.
The hands are soft.	Matsoho a bonolo.
Get out of school.	Tloha sekolong.
He knows when it is.	O tseba mohla e leng teng.
He drank coffee.	O ile a noa kofi.
I'll tell you all when you get here.	Ke tla o bolella tsohle ha o fihla mona.
What could it be	E ka ba eng
You do not know until you look.	Ha o tsebe ho fihlela o sheba.
He hadn't looked at them in a long time.	O ne a se a sa li sheba ka nako e telele.
But it can be real.	Empa e ka ba ntho ea sebele.
That's the way things are.	Ke kamoo lintho li leng kateng.
I think something is wrong here.	Ke nahana hore phoso e teng mona.
I didn't even see him that night.	Ha kea ka ka mo bona le moo bosiung boo.
I can feel it.	Ke khona ho e utloa.
Thank you, thank you, thank you !.	Kea leboha, kea leboha, kea leboha!.
But still it does not matter.	Empa leha ho le joalo ha ho na taba.
And a lot if we can get it.	'Me e ngata haeba re ka e fumana.
I could not see the children anywhere.	Ke ne ke sa bone bana kae kapa kae.
You should not make the same mistake.	Ha ua lokela ho etsa phoso e tšoanang.
There were front and back.	Ho ne ho e-na le pele le ka morao.
The baby started to cry.	Ngoana a qala ho lla.
We hope you enjoy it !!!.	Re tšepa hore u tla e thabela!!!.
All my children worked there.	Bana ba ka kaofela ba ne ba sebetsa moo.
I really get it.	Ke hlile kea e fumana.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha se taba eo.
I think that's my opinion.	Ke nahana hore ke maikutlo a ka.
But they are there.	Empa ba teng.
That's a lot.	Ke tse ngata.
He agreed to take the job.	O ile a lumela ho nka mosebetsi oo.
He said he would leave her when she finished.	A re o tla mo tlohela ha a qeta.
The same thing could happen here.	Ho ka etsahala se tšoanang le mona.
She wishes she had a baby she could love.	O lakatsa eka a ka be a e-na le ngoana eo a ka mo ratang.
You do not think about what you are doing.	Ha o nahane ka seo o se etsang.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke na bonnete.
Doing things, and understanding things.	Ho etsa lintho, le ho utloisisa lintho.
He was just that kind of a man.	E ne e le monna wa mofuta oo feela.
Many people wanted to get in.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba batla ho kena.
Sleeping during breakfast.	Ho robala nakong ea lijo tsa hoseng.
I wish you could read them.	Ke lakatsa eka u ka li bala.
That he was also present.	Hore le eena o ne a le teng.
But they are just as good as they are now.	Empa ba hantle joalo ka ha ba le sieo hona joale.
He received his diploma last year.	O fumane lengolo la hae selemong se fetileng.
I want to be here.	Ke batla ho ba mona.
They are very good things.	Ke ntho tse ntle haholo.
However, it is not very difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho thata haholo.
They just did it.	Ba sa tsoa e etsa.
I enjoyed it and learned a lot.	Ke ile ka e thabela ’me ka ithuta lintho tse ngata.
Why didn't you tell us about him?	Ke hobane'ng ha u sa ka ua re bolella ka eena?
It is not.	Ha se.
That morning, she told me.	Hoseng hona hoo, o ile a mpolella.
I'm sorry to see you go.	Ke masoabi ho u bona u tsamaea.
What else can he do.	Ke eng hape eo a ka e etsang.
I don't know what he did.	Ha ke tsebe seo a se entseng.
You cannot use both at the same time.	U ke ke ua li sebelisa ka bobeli ka nako e le 'ngoe.
Do not look for another.	Le se ke la batla e mong.
It should not have done so either.	E ne e sa lokela ho etsa joalo le hona.
I knew nothing about this at the time.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe letho la sena ka nako eo.
What you do is important.	Seo u se etsang ke sa bohlokoa.
That had to be what we had to do.	Seo e ne e lokela ho ba seo re neng re lokela ho se etsa.
He never met anyone.	Ha a ka a kopana le motho.
I think they probably will.	Ke nahana hore mohlomong ba tla etsa joalo.
Amazing time to see the big man win.	Nako e makatsang ea ho bona monna e moholo a hlola.
Rear end.	Ka morao.
Although both are almost equal.	Le hoja ka bobeli li batla li lekana.
Then, the fall began.	Joale, ho oa ho ile ha qala.
Write a letter to help your family.	Ngola lengolo ho thusa lelapa la hau.
This house has it and more.	Ntlo ena e na le eona le tse ling.
The baby girl looked beautiful.	Ngoana oa ngoanana o ne a shebahala a le motle.
It was hard for everyone.	Ho ne ho bile thata ho bohle.
He does not seem to be sleeping all night.	Ha ho bonahale a robala bosiu bohle.
I just want you to understand if it can happen.	Ke batla feela hore u utloisise haeba ho ka etsahala.
It saves time and head.	E boloka nako le hlooho.
I understand what you are saying.	Ke utloisisa seo u se buang.
I could be nothing without it.	Ke ne nke ke ka ba letho ntle le eona.
They were both embarrassed.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba le lihlong.
When buying books, make sure you read their comments.	Ha u reka libuka, etsa bonnete ba hore u bala maikutlo a bona.
The last one called.	Ea ho qetela o ile a mo letsetsa.
I hope it will happen soon.	Ke tšepa hore e tla etsahala haufinyane.
We had a hard time getting here.	Re bile le nako e thata ho fihla mona.
It doesn't always matter to them.	Kamehla ha e na taba ho bona.
Be a dog.	Ebe ntja.
You said it was a problem.	U itse ke bothata.
He just fell asleep in the morning.	O sa tsoa robala hoseng.
You have a son about your age.	O na le mora ea ka bang lilemo tsa hau.
And they stop and do it again.	Mme ba a ema mme ba e etse hape.
He was powerless.	O ne a sena matla.
He did not even cry.	Ha a ka a lla le ho lla.
He is home.	O hae.
They do the same thing.	Ba etsa sona seo.
Probably not as strong as some of the previous years.	Mohlomong ha e matla joalo ka tse ling tsa lilemo tse fetileng.
And you will be better off too.	Mme le wena o tla be o le betere.
Be with your friends.	E-ba le metsoalle ea hau.
We do not tell them that.	Ha re ba bolelle seo.
They fell asleep.	Ba ile ba robala.
There was one there, yes.	Ho ne ho e-na le e mong moo, e.
It took a long time to play like before.	Ho ne ho nka nako e telele ho bapala joaloka pele.
People are suffering.	Batho ba utloa bohloko.
We need to get out.	Re lokela ho tsoa.
Many have stood in this place.	Ba bangata ba kile ba ema sebakeng sena.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
It will be needed.	Ho tla hlokahala.
He often slept on the floor.	Hangata o ne a robala fatše.
It is important.	Ke ea bohlokoa.
You must love him.	O lokela ho mo rata.
We often got along well here.	Hangata re ne re kopana hantle mona.
They gave him thirty years.	Ba mo fa lilemo tse mashome a mararo.
Clearly not a human.	Ho hlakile hore ha se motho.
Of course, you have to try.	Ehlile, u tlameha ho leka.
If you don't see it, you probably won't find it.	Haeba u sa e bone, mohlomong u ke ke ua e fumana.
The girl is his.	Ngoanana ke oa hae.
It can't beat it.	Ha e khone ho e hlola.
It seemed too good to be true.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le monate haholo hore e ka ba 'nete.
This may take some time.	Sena se ka 'na sa nka nako.
But some people refuse.	Empa batho ba bang ba hana.
Why the mind always wants more.	Ke hobane'ng ha kelello e lula e batla ho feta.
The boy started to cry.	Moshanyana o ile a qala ho lla.
Eating to eat.	Ho ja ho ja.
Get away from us.	Tloha ho rona.
Nice to meet you.	Ke thabela ho kopana le wena.
It had only three legs.	E ne e na le maoto a mararo feela.
However, they do not.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ba etse joalo.
The real one was very simple.	Ea sebele e ne e le bonolo haholo.
I already feel happier.	Ke se ke ntse ke ikutloa ke thabile haholoanyane.
That's simple.	Ke tseo tse bonolo.
So, we continue to do, what we like to do.	Ka hona, re tsoela pele ho etsa, seo re ratang ho se etsa.
You can't ask more, can you?	Ha u khone ho botsa ho feta, na u ka khona?
I had to stay.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho lula.
He can fix anything.	A ka lokisa eng kapa eng.
Ask the question after the question.	Botsa potso e ka mora potso.
He thought of trying to take a picture.	O ile a nahana ho leka ho nka setšoantšo.
The rest is the same as before.	Tse ling kaofela li joalo ka pele.
In fact, many people believe that this will happen.	Ha e le hantle, batho ba bangata ba lumela hore sena se tla etsahala.
However, there are other opinions.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le maikutlo a mang.
Read more, here.	Bala haholoanyane, mona.
It's up to you how you do it.	Ho ho uena hore na u e etsa joang.
However, there is an error.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le phoso.
Sorry to see them go.	Ka masoabi ho bona a tsamaea.
We are very much.	Re haholo.
Almost no one can.	Hoo e ka bang ha ho motho ea ka khonang.
We went into the room.	Re ile ra kena ka kamoreng.
Maybe he did.	Mohlomong o ile a etsa joalo.
He wanted to watch.	O ne a batla ho shebella.
He did not know who he was.	O ne a sa tsebe seo a leng sona.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.	Re tla bua ka eona hosane.
It is their life.	Ke bophelo ba bona.
After a good night's sleep, she felt better.	Ka mor’a ho robala hantle bosiu, o ile a ikutloa a le betere.
It provides everything we need.	E fana ka sohle seo re se hlokang.
And so it was.	Mme ho bile jwalo.
But law is law.	Empa molao ke molao.
That's his mind.	Kelello ya hae eo.
They will not give it to us.	Ba ke ke ba re fa eona.
This may actually be happening.	E ka 'na eaba sena se hlile se etsahala.
I was very happy.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo.
But he knew he had done it.	Empa o ne a tseba hore o entse joalo.
That's what people want.	Ke lintho tseo batho ba li batlang.
So, what kind of father was he?	Joale, e ne e le ntate oa mofuta ofe?
They asked if we could return tomorrow.	Ba botsa hore na re ka mpa ra khutla hosane.
One of them would be theirs.	E 'ngoe ea tsona e ne e tla ba ea bona.
More than now.	Ho feta hona joale.
But of course, no.	Empa ho joalo, che.
I was working on it.	Ke ne ke e sebetsa.
Fine tune.	Lokisa hantle.
I wonder where he lives.	Kea ipotsa hore na o lula kae.
If only you could see what that means.	Ha feela o ne o ka bona hore na hoo ho bolela eng.
It just never really happened.	Feela ha ho mohla e kileng ea etsahala ka 'nete.
Money was just fine to have.	Chelete e ne e le ntle feela ho ba le.
Everyone talked about it, but no one did anything.	E mong le e mong o ile a bua ka eona, empa ha ho motho ea entseng letho.
Nice place to be, it seems.	Sebaka se setle sa ho ba teng, se bonahala.
The water level seems to be very high.	Ho bonahala eka boemo ba metsi bo bile teng haholo.
There was no way he was talking to anyone.	Ho ne ho se kamoo a neng a bua le mang kapa mang.
Then we will give it to them.	Joale re tla ba fa eona.
We have all done our job.	Kaofela re entse mosebetsi oa rona.
They left at night.	Ba ile ba tsamaea bosiu.
Don't think of anything else.	U se ke ua nahana ka ntho leha e le efe e 'ngoe.
Instead there will be problems.	Ho e-na le hoo ho tla ba le mathata.
Kind of sorry.	Mofuta oa masoabi.
It's dangerous.	Ke kotsi.
So much so.	Haholo joalo.
I'm just a human being.	Ke motho feela.
Dinner with friends.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea le metsoalle.
The problem was somewhere else.	Bothata bo ne bo le sebakeng se seng.
You say it, it has to be.	U e bua, e tlameha ho ba joalo.
You have to do that.	O lokela ho etsa seo.
They will read his books.	Ba tla bala libuka tsa hae.
More than anywhere.	Ho feta kae kapa kae.
After much persuasion, he agreed to go with us.	Ka mor’a ho kholisa nako e telele o ile a lumela ho tsamaea le rōna.
It should not happen that way.	Ha ea lokela ho etsahala ka tsela eo.
And we did so.	Mme ra etsa jwalo.
I find a dog.	Ke fumana ntja.
He said that man could never do the same thing again.	O ile a re motho a ke ke a hlola a etsa lintho tse tšoanang.
I just love pain.	Ke rata bohloko feela.
I had just asked him something.	Ke ne ke qeta ho mo botsa ho hong.
I think that's our point.	Ke nahana hore ke eona taba ea rona.
It could be his, recently finished.	E ka ba ea hae, e sa tsoa qeta.
But do not say or do anything.	Empa u se ke ua bua kapa ua etsa letho.
He eats almost anything.	O ja hoo e ka bang ntho leha e le efe.
He wanted something.	O ne a batla ho hong.
That’s kind of what we do.	Ke mofuta oa seo re se etsang.
They both made a lot of money.	Ka bobeli ba ile ba etsa chelete e ngata.
I want you .	Kea u batla .
But we will be there for him.	Empa re tla ba teng bakeng sa hae.
He wants to retire next year.	O batla ho tlohela mosebetsi selemong se tlang.
I know them very well.	Ke ba tseba haholo.
He always seems to be in pain.	O bonahala a utloile bohloko kamehla.
I did not try.	Ha kea ka ka leka.
Stay there.	U lule moo.
Maybe with other issues.	Mohlomong le litaba tse ling.
She reads a lot.	O bala haholo.
They want the best for themselves.	Ba batla lintho tse ntle.
It has become nothing.	E se e se letho.
We can be better than that.	Re ka ba betere ho feta moo.
He had to come in tomorrow.	O ne a lokela ho kena hosane.
I know you are there.	Kea tseba hore u teng.
That’s why we do what we do.	Ke kahoo re etsang seo re se etsang.
You're just thinking.	U ntse u nahana feela.
Some of them he liked.	Tse ling tsa tsona o ne a li rata.
He made coffee.	O ile a etsa kofi.
Maybe he could tell his father or his friends.	Mohlomong o ne a ka bolella ntate oa hae kapa metsoalle ea hae.
We talk a little.	Re bua hanyane.
I visited.	Ke ile ka etela.
She wanted to look good to him.	O ne a batla ho shebahala hantle ho eena.
What he said.	Seo a se buileng.
Like yours, here.	Joalo ka ea hau, mona.
I had never said that before.	Ke ne ke eso bue joalo.
I didn't care if you believed it or not.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle hore na ua e lumela kapa che.
He knew how to do it.	O ne a tseba ho e etsa.
Mine is one of them.	Ea ka ke e 'ngoe ea tsona.
What he said was very serious.	Ntho eo a ileng a e bua e ne e le boima haholo.
Mom, fix your hair.	'M'e, lokisa moriri oa hau.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
How he could do nothing to fix it.	Kamoo a neng a ke ke a etsa letho ho e lokisa.
It can be anyone.	E ka ba mang kapa mang.
It was as if he were not there.	E ne eka ha a eo.
But be careful.	Empa hlokomela.
And that's a good thing.	Mme ke ntho e ntle.
But there is no specific feeling of pain.	Empa ha ho na maikutlo a itseng a bohloko.
We feel the same way.	Re maikutlo a tšoanang.
To find out more, read on.	Ho tseba haholoanyane, bala ho tsoela pele.
Then he may know that his mother is not there.	Joale a ka 'na a tseba hore 'mè oa hae ha a eo.
It is very easy to write it.	Ke bonolo haholo ho e ngola.
It was an accident.	E bile kotsi.
Maybe there is, too.	Mohlomong e teng, hape.
He refused to talk to me.	A hana ho bua le nna.
Maybe they do.	Mohlomong ba etsa joalo.
And we will find you next year.	Mme re tla o fumana selemong se tlang.
I do not like this method.	Ha ke rate mokhoa ona.
He did not want to.	O ne a sa batle.
I see this all the time.	Ke bona sena ka linako tsohle.
However, I hope you will find what you are looking for.	Leha ho le joalo, ke tšepa hore u tla fumana seo u se batlang.
I'm still working.	Ke ntse ke tsoela pele ka mosebetsi.
I know it's not me.	Kea tseba hore ha se nna.
No money needed.	Ha ho hlokahale chelete.
I could not speak.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho bua.
My parents knew what was important to me.	Batsoali ba ka ba ne ba tseba seo e leng sa bohlokoa ho ’na.
Thank you for doing such a great job with this.	Kea leboha ka ho etsa mosebetsi o motle hakana ka sena.
You know we used to be friends.	Ua tseba re kile ra ba metsoalle.
I would love to see where these things go !.	Ke tla thabela ho bona hore na lintho tsena li fihla kae!.
We got out of there and did it.	Re ile ra tsoa moo 'me ra e etsa.
He did what he did.	O entse seo a se entseng.
Now it's regular.	Hona joale ke ea kamehla.
He did not enter.	Ha a ka a kena.
My mother is still there.	'Mè o ntse a le teng.
Lie on the floor and do not try anything.	Robala fatše 'me u se ke ua leka letho.
She is in pain.	O utloa bohloko.
Many other people do not believe in these things.	Batho ba bang ba bangata ha ba lumele lintho tsena.
That makes my mom go.	Seo se etsa hore mme oa ka a tsamaee.
But, it would be wrong.	Empa, e ka ba phoso.
Some see it though.	Ba bang ba bona leha ho le joalo.
But she looks beautiful, her things look good.	Empa o shebahala a le motle, lintho tsa hae li shebahala hantle.
They wonder what the other young man looks like.	Ba ipotsa hore na mohlankana e mong le eena o shebahala joang.
He did, indeed.	O entse, ruri.
We hope we can continue to do so.	Re tšepa hore re ka tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
With that you can be sure.	Ka seo u ka ba le bonnete.
It was a book, of course, but there was more.	E ne e le buka, ho hlakile, empa ho ne ho e-na le ho feta.
But it was definitely fun.	Empa ka sebele e bile monate.
It just doesn't exist.	Ha e eo feela.
But we don't have to.	Empa ha rea ​​tlameha.
I thought you could tell me not to go.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o ka mpolella hore ke se ke ka ea.
I think this is what we should expect.	Ke nahana hore sena ke seo re lokelang ho se lebella.
There are several problems with this method.	Ho na le mathata a 'maloa ka mokhoa ona.
You feel that way.	U ikutloa joalo.
Most of the food at that time was local.	Lijo tse ngata ka nako eo e ne e le tsa sebakeng seo.
Understand its weight.	Utloisisa boima ba eona.
We returned home.	Re ile ra khutlela hae.
We know more now than ever before.	Re tseba ho feta hona joale ho feta pele.
So thank you in advance.	Kahoo ke leboha esale pele.
Write more !.	Ngola tse ling hape!.
He has a good idea.	O na le mohopolo o motle.
I know.	Kea tseba.
It is now or never !.	Ke hona joale kapa ha ho mohla!.
We don't talk much while we wait for them.	Ha re bue haholo ha re ntse re ba emetse.
That's what they are.	Ke seo ba leng sona.
Soon it will be better, though.	Haufinyane ho tla ba betere, leha ho le joalo.
They could read and write.	Ba ne ba tseba ho bala le ho ngola.
He is the only person who can.	Ke mofuta oa motho eo e leng eena feela.
But you should not be able to do both at the same time.	Empa u se ke ua khona ho li etsa ka bobeli ka nako e le 'ngoe.
You got this.	O fumane sena.
Now he wondered why he thought he could.	Joale o ne a ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ne a nahana hore a ka khona.
She was really crying.	O ne a hlile a lla.
Here it is!	Ke ena!
You are the people next to me.	Ke lona batho ba haufi le nna.
We always do this.	Kamehla re etsa sena.
And it will happen during the week.	'Me e tla etsahala nakong ea beke.
I cried a lot.	Ke ile ka lla haholo.
That happens often.	Seo se etsahala hangata.
That is a pity.	Seo ke masoabi.
I found them again, too.	Ke li fumane hape, haholo.
We were moving fast.	Re ne re tsamaea kapele.
With water.	Ka metsi.
Then he would be stronger than she is.	Joale o ne a tla ba matla ho mo feta.
Do your homework first.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau oa sekolo pele.
They may not get the best ideas from their people.	Ba ka 'na ba se ke ba fumana maikutlo a molemo ka ho fetisisa ho batho ba bona.
So far, the children are still there.	Ho fihlela joale, bana ba ntse ba le teng.
I wondered.	Ke ne ke ile ka ipotsa.
The car drove away.	Koloi e ile ea tsamaea.
That's where we never went.	Ke moo re so kang ra ya teng.
It was hard work.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima.
It has never received such information.	Ha e so fumane litaba tse joalo.
It is not always easy.	Ha se kamehla ho leng bonolo.
New to them.	E ncha ho bona.
No, you do not have to work.	Che, ha ua tlameha ho sebetsa.
The man slept through the whole thing.	Monna o ile a robala ka ntho eo kaofela.
Today, however, we continue to spend less and less money.	Leha ho le joalo kajeno, re ntse re tsoela pele ho sebelisa chelete e seng teng.
It's too close.	E haufi haholo.
However he was able to play a lot.	Leha ho le joalo o ile a khona ho bapala haholo.
And it is very powerful.	Mme e matla haholo.
But when she returned home, the problem started.	Empa ha a tloha a khutlela hae, bothata bo ile ba qala.
In the evening he began to see nothing at all.	Mantsiboea o ile a qala ho se bone ho hang.
It was difficult for me.	Ho 'na ho ne ho le boima.
No one has it.	Ha ho motho ea nang le eona.
Again, here we go again.	Hape, ke mona re ea hape.
And it was because of me.	'Me e ne e le ka lebaka la ka.
That really was just another matter.	Hore ehlile e ne e le taba e ’ngoe feela.
I would like to see what people do with this.	Ke kopa ho bona hore na batho ba etsa eng ka sena.
That is not the case now.	Taba eo ha se eona hona joale.
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
It seems like a good thing, not a bad thing.	Eka ke ntho e ntle, e seng e mpe.
This is your problem.	Ena ke bothata ba hau.
If you do not find it, you can find it here.	Haeba u sa e fumane, u ka e fumana mona.
This was not the way.	Ena e ne e se tsela.
He tried to help her.	O ile a leka ho mo thusa.
People need to connect with people.	Batho ba hloka ho kopana le batho.
There she is again, she thought.	Ke eo hape, a nahana.
I just want you to find a way to fix this issue.	Ke batla feela hore o fumane mokhoa oa ho lokisa taba ena.
He asked the girl if she wanted to and she refused.	O ile a botsa ngoanana hore na o batla 'me a hana.
People earn money from this work.	Batho ba fumana chelete mosebetsing ona.
He brings that with you.	O tla le seo le wena.
We are already too late.	Re se re le morao haholo.
He looked at it.	O ile a sheba ho eona.
I kept thinking about that problem.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele ho nahana ka bothata boo.
But of course it can.	Empa ha e le hantle e ka khona.
I'll tell you when.	Ke tla u bolella neng.
I loved having a room by myself.	Ke ne ke rata ho ba le kamore ke le mong.
The children loved her.	Bana ba moo ba ne ba mo rata.
To do so.	Ho etsa joalo.
I will buy here again.	Ke tla reka mona hape.
But we should not go now.	Empa ha rea ​​lokela ho tsamaea hona joale.
She has many things to do for her.	O na le lintho tse ngata tseo a tlang ho mo etsetsa tsona.
Maybe he'll come back with her now.	Mohlomong o tla khutlela le eena hona joale.
It is not difficult to understand why.	Ha ho thata ho utloisisa lebaka.
One of the things is to watch.	E 'ngoe ea lintho ke ho shebella.
This is my whole life.	Bophelo bohle ke bona.
I had no idea where the problem was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na bothata bo hokae.
Do not sleep.	U se ke ua robala.
The problem with books is that people will read them.	Bothata ba libuka ke hore batho ba tla li bala.
He still has it.	O ntse a e-na le eona.
It looks very nice.	E shebahala e le ntle haholo.
How will you do the same ?.	U tla etsa se tšoanang joang?.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
Now, in that day.	Jwale, ka letsatsi leo.
Probably, a little.	Mohlomong, hanyane.
Getting started quickly.	Ho qala kapele.
Or he should not have.	Kapa o ne a sa lokela ho ba le.
Then he sat down at work, though tired.	Eaba o lula fatše mosebetsing, le hoja a khathetse.
Then several things happened at the same time.	Eaba ho etsahala lintho tse ’maloa ka nako e le ’ngoe.
I did not want to sleep.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho robala.
But he had never thought of this.	Empa o ne a e-s’o ka a nahana ka sena.
He doesn't seem to know anything.	Ho bonahala eka ha a tsebe letho.
You need to talk to him.	U lokela ho bua le eena.
This should work, please, try.	Sena se lokela ho sebetsa, ka kopo, leka.
Why not?' 	Hobaneng ho se joalo?'
I did not tell her much.	Ha kea ka ka mo bolella tse ngata.
We just have to be in it.	Re tlameha feela ho ba ho eona.
They are somewhat difficult to understand.	Li batla li le thata ho li utloisisa.
Just some of them are in you, you know.	Feela tse ling tsa tsona li ho uena, ua tseba.
We need to do the same.	Le rōna re lokela ho etsa joalo.
I did my job and he did his.	Ke ile ka etsa mosebetsi oa ka ’me eena a etsa oa hae.
It didn't look right.	Ha ea ka ea bonahala hantle.
My father has no idea.	Ntate ha a na maikutlo.
Never forget your name.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua lebala lebitso la hau.
I used to be human with.	Ke kile ka ba motho le.
Man, maybe you were there.	Monna, mohlomong u ne u le teng.
It is enough for one.	Le lekana e mong.
Only if there is a problem.	Feela haeba ho na le bothata.
I read a lot.	Ke ne ke bala haholo.
It would not take long.	E ne e ka se nke nako e telele.
We can wait that long.	Re ka ema nako e telele hakaalo.
It works for me.	E sebetsa ho nna.
But here, nothing.	Empa mona, ha ho letho.
His approach was simple.	Mokhoa oa hae o ne o le bonolo.
Now look at what they did to him.	Joale bona seo ba mo entseng sona.
Nothing more.	Ha ho letho le leng.
But all we have to do is try.	Empa seo re lokelang ho se etsa ke ho leka.
Some people are still around you.	Batho ba bang ba ntse ba le teng haufi le uena.
He doesn't care what you think of him.	Ha a tsotelle hore na u nahana eng ka eena.
This may mean visiting it again and again.	Sena se ka bolela ho e etela hape ka makhetlo a 'maloa.
It should be easy to get to.	E lokela ho ba bonolo ho fihla ho eona.
That is what happened here.	Ke sona se etsahetseng mona.
You know what he is like.	Ua tseba hore na o joang.
Have you ever been to this place?	Na u kile ua fihla sebakeng see?
Or whether one of them does.	Kapa hore na e mong oa bona o etsa joalo.
Obviously, that will not happen.	Ho hlakile hore seo ha se na ho etsahala.
I really enjoyed this one.	Ke thabetse ena haholo.
Well done, man.	O entse hantle, monna.
I did not want to see anyone.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho bona motho.
The school is in progress.	Sekolo se ntse se tsoela pele.
He is the Son of the Father.	Ke mora oa Ntate.
None of us had seen this coming.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea neng a bone sena se tla.
They needed to go, too.	Ba ne ba hloka ho tsamaea, le bona.
They probably even knew it.	Mohlomong ba ne ba bile ba e tseba.
Time is everything.	Nako ke ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
I'd like to know what's going on.	Ke kopa ho tseba hore na ho etsahalang.
I don't want to do it here.	Ha ke batle ho e etsa mona.
We want to have a good time.	Re batla ho ba le nako e monate.
Bedtime!	Nako ea ho robala!
She loved being with him.	O ne a rata ho ba le eena.
I sat down to stand.	Ke ile ka lula fatše ho ema.
I am a mother.	Ke mme.
The children are wearing strange clothes.	Bana ba apere liaparo tse makatsang.
The problem is that in their fourth year they are gone.	Bothata bo teng selemong sa bone se sieo.
He begged her not to go.	O ile a mo kopa hore a se ke a tsamaea.
I would like to know why.	Nka thabela ho tseba lebaka.
It will do it again.	E tla etsa hape.
I did not hear what he said.	Ha kea ka ka utloa seo a se buileng.
We are learning.	Re ntse re ithuta.
We knew exactly what we were doing and what we should do.	Re ne re tseba hantle seo re se etsang le seo re lokelang ho se etsa.
There was no reason to.	Ho ne ho se na lebaka la ho.
And it's good for me.	Mme e ntle ho nna.
Time for how long this takes.	Nako hore na sena se nka nako e kae.
How to do this?	Mokhoa oa ho etsa see?
This is very important.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa haholo.
Not only that, man.	Che feela, motho.
Instead, he called his wife.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a letsetsa mosali oa hae.
We haven't seen them very much.	Ha re so ba bone haholo.
Maybe he should have done that.	Mohlomong o ne a lokela ho etsa joalo.
That was very clear.	Seo se ne se hlakile haholo.
They preached to him.	Ba mo rera.
Thanks for coming.	Re leboha ho tla.
Therefore, we take to heart what he said.	Ka hona, re nka seo a se buileng e le 'nete.
This past week.	Bekeng e fetileng ena.
You just have to ask him.	U lokela ho mo botsa feela.
And then there was her son.	Mme hape ho ne ho ena le mora wa hae.
People may say that they will give you anything, but they never did.	Batho ba ka re ba tla u fa eng kapa eng, empa ha ho mohla ba kileng ba etsa joalo.
Something like that happens.	Ntho ea mofuta oo e etsahala.
This week is going to be a lot of fun.	Beke ena e tla ba monate haholo.
A week later, no one had ever seen or heard of him.	Ka mor'a beke, ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a mo bona kapa a utloa ka eena.
You will find that they want to do it.	U tla fumana hore ba batla ho e etsa.
No one says anything.	Ha ho motho ea buang letho.
We finally reached our destination.	Qetellong re ile ra fihla moo re neng re ea teng.
However, it was in the past.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le nakong e fetileng.
Very strange.	Ho makatsang haholo.
Moreover, think of it.	Ho feta moo, nahana ka eona.
Good as sweet.	E ntle joalo ka monate.
She looked beautiful.	O ne a shebahala a le motle.
No, this was passing.	Che, sena se ne se feta.
I didn't have that.	Ke ne ke sena seo.
Trust me.	Tšepa.
And they will do whatever you want.	'Me ba tla etsa sohle seo u se batlang.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
That used to be easy.	Seo se kile sa ba bonolo.
She was a girl of good times.	E ne e le ngoanana oa nako e monate.
This has been fun.	Sena se bile monate.
He thought of everything.	O ne a nahana ka lintho tsohle.
There was a party there.	Ho ne ho e-na le mokete moo.
Thank you for your feedback.	Ke leboha maikutlo a hau.
We have time.	Re na le nako.
Predicting pain is very difficult	Ho bolela bohloko esale pele ho thata haholo
The same is true today.	Ho jwalo le kajeno.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke e tsebe hantle.
They have a lot.	Ba na le tse ngata.
So, we are very happy.	Kahoo, re thabile haholo.
Be with us.	Eba le rona.
Indeed, he is.	Ruri, o teng.
However, this work did not work.	Leha ho le joalo, mosebetsi ona ha oa ka oa sebetsa.
She has been so good!	O bile hantle haholo!
And we wept, and we wept.	Mme ra lla, mme ra lla.
But it did not take them long to reconsider.	Empa ha hoa ka ha ba nka nako e telele ho nahana hape.
That was usually everyone.	Eo hangata e neng e le motho e mong le e mong.
I want to hear what people think.	Ke batla ho utloa seo batho ba se nahanang.
I never watched them.	Le ka mohla ha kea ka ka li shebella.
I don't have to do this.	Ha kea tlameha ho etsa sena.
You feel like you can help your team.	U ikutloa eka u ka thusa sehlopha sa hau.
People know who you are.	Batho baa tseba hore na u mang.
The truth was that he could, but he did not want to.	'Nete e ne e le hore a ka khona, empa o ne a sa batle.
Do not forget to say thank you.	U se ke ua lebala ho leboha.
He refused to sleep.	O ne a hana ho robala.
I'll see you there.	Ke tla o bona moo.
You're not that kind of a woman.	Ha u mosali oa mofuta oo.
So just pay attention to that.	Kahoo hlokomela taba eo feela.
I read the books she was reading.	Ke ile ka bala libuka tseo a neng a li bala.
He did not hear her.	Ha aa ka a mo utloa.
Everything feels like old, the same old.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ikutloa joaloka ea khale, e tšoanang ea khale.
I can't leave you right now.	Ha ke khone ho u tlohela hantle hona joale.
And they sleep well at night.	Mme ba robala hantle feela bosiu.
However, that was not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se joalo.
That is a difficult question!	Ke potso e thata eo!
Or it certainly seemed that way.	Kapa ka sebele ho ile ha bonahala ho le joalo.
If they do not, well.	Haeba ba sa etse joalo, hantle.
We got better.	Re ile ra ba betere.
Several people were coming in and going out.	Batho ba ’maloa ba ne ba kena le ho tsoa.
This is a mistake.	Sena ke phoso.
Write daily.	Ngola letsatsi le letsatsi.
He was glad he had not learned to drive.	O ne a thabetse hore ebe ha aa ithuta ho khanna.
He refused to let her go.	O ile a hana ho mo lumella ho tsamaea.
It is hard work.	Ke mosebetsi o boima.
If they say no, try not to feel that way.	Haeba ba hana, leka hore u se ke ua ikutloa ka tsela eo.
Tom had nothing to say, time.	Tom o ne a se na letho leo a ka le buang, nako.
But it does not.	Empa ha e etse jwalo.
That will not be the case for the injury.	Ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo ho ea kotsi.
He said he would see it.	O itse o tla e bona.
Then he could not.	Eaba o sitoa.
For their easy opening.	Bakeng sa ho bula ha bona ha bonolo.
Find out how.	Fumana hore na joang.
I can take your tool.	Nka sebetsa sa hao.
They have an opinion, you know.	Ba na le maikutlo, ua tseba.
He was making coffee.	O ne a etsa kofi.
There was no one else behind.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong ka morao.
So we'll just have to leave it behind us here.	Kahoo re tla tlameha feela ho e tlohela ka morao ho rona mona.
Don't just do it.	O seke oa e etsa feela.
He held it for a very long time.	O ile a e tšoara nako e telele haholo.
I knew he was useless.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ha a na thuso.
It's easy.	Ho bonolo.
Yes, do so.	E, etsa joalo.
He did so, gently.	O ile a etsa joalo, ka bonolo.
We get it !.	Re a e fumana!.
Honestly, most of them are bad.	Ho bua ’nete, tse ngata tsa tsona li mpe.
The man said nothing.	Monna eo ha aa ka a bua letho.
Just get out of here.	Tloha mona feela.
It could have been better.	Ho ka be ho bile betere.
And he would love to stand right here.	Mme a ka thabela ho ema hona mona.
I enjoy it.	Kea e thabela.
Not as good as you think.	Ha e ntle joalo ka ha u nahana.
So, you can't decide.	Ka hona, u ke ke ua etsa qeto.
And nothing will happen.	Mme ha ho letho le tla etsahala.
You can see some of his work on.	U ka bona tse ling tsa mosebetsi oa hae ho.
I saw it was too late.	Ke bone e se e le morao haholo.
Plus, it was fun to do.	Ho feta moo, ho ne ho le monate ho etsa.
We had no money.	Re ne re se na chelete.
You will need to do this alone.	Sena u tla hloka ho se etsa u le mong.
I can't go back now.	Ha ke khone ho khutlela morao hona joale.
After all that time, she started to cry.	Ka mor'a nako eo eohle, o ile a lla.
And when you do, it becomes easier.	'Me ha u etsa joalo, ho sebetsa ho ba bonolo.
But there is no alternative.	Empa mokhoa o mong ha o eo.
Don't talk to me.	Se bue le nna.
You stand and see.	Wena ema o bone.
That is why it is good to hear what you have to say.	Ke kahoo ho leng molemo ho utloa seo u se buang.
And more than you.	Mme ho feta wena.
There is nothing you can say about them.	Ha ho letho leo u ka le buang ka bona.
You can't, it doesn't exist.	Ha o khone, ha e eo.
He had it.	O ne a e-na le eona.
You can do this very easily.	U ka etsa sena ka mokhoa o bonolo haholo.
I do not like.	Ha ke rate.
Yes, he can.	Ee, a ka 'na a mo boloka a le joalo.
He asked them if they could ask the man one question.	O ile a ba botsa hore na ba ka botsa monna eo potso e le 'ngoe.
He does his job and he does it well.	O etsa mosebetsi oa hae mme o o etsa hantle.
They do not have to decide.	Ha baa tlameha ho etsa qeto.
It was not enough.	Ho ne ho sa lekana feela.
If not now, when ?.	Haeba e se hona joale, neng?.
None of them have to win.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea lokelang ho hlola.
He felt better, better than he had ever had.	O ne a ikutloa a le betere, a le betere ho feta kamoo a neng a e-na le nako.
Life is useless without you.	Ho phela ha ho na thuso ntle le uena.
My family and friends.	Lelapa la ka le metsoalle.
It is only a matter of time.	Ke taba ea nako feela.
I am looking for a man.	Ke batla monna.
Dinner started.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea tsa qala.
And we found him.	Mme ra mo fumana.
I just wanted to get home to him.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho fihla hae ho eena.
This he could not do at all.	Sena o ne a ke ke a se etsa ho hang.
They do not say that.	Ha ba bue joalo.
That, my friends, is a very dangerous way to start on the ground.	Seo, metsoalle ea ka, ke tsela e kotsi haholo ho qala fatše.
Start talking to them.	Qala ho bua le bona.
I would never be able to find a job.	Ke ne nke ke ka khona ho fumana mosebetsi.
Maybe they can do a better job than us.	Mohlomong ba ka etsa mosebetsi o betere ho feta rona.
It's just that.	E mpa feela e le eona.
This is how we should expect.	Sena ke kamoo re lokelang ho lebella.
For each one it is a good place to start.	Ho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe ke sebaka se setle sa ho qala.
I once met you.	Ke kile ka kopana le uena.
I really like it.	Ke hlile ke e rata.
Often he can’t.	Hangata ha a khone.
Unless it is true.	Ntle le hore ke 'nete.
It doesn't matter to me.	Ha se taba le nna.
I don't know why, it's just that.	Ha ke tsebe hobaneng, ho jwalo feela.
Same with you.	E tšoanang le uena.
Then they sat down again.	Eaba ba lula ba bang hape.
He opened it, but it was empty.	A e bula, empa e ne e se na letho.
See, life is a wonderful thing.	Le a bona, bophelo ke ntho e monate.
That will not happen here.	Seo ha se tlo etsahala mona.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore ho na le ntho e joalo.
But he needed someone to make him do it.	Empa o ne a hloka motho ea ka mo etsang hore a e etse.
I would like to enjoy life this year.	Ke kopa ho thabela bophelo selemong sena.
Learning things.	Ho ithuta lintho.
I had it.	Ke bile le eona.
And her hair.	Le moriri oa hae.
Check this out.	Sheba sena.
They seemed indifferent.	Ba ne ba bonahala ba sa tsotelle.
We will not hear it.	Ha re na ho e utloa.
Never.	Le ka mohla ha ho mohla.
It just could not have happened.	E ka be e sa etsahala feela.
We have never exceeded the amount we have.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra feta chelete eo re nang le eona.
Some clothes look better.	Liaparo tse ling li shebahala li le betere.
That doesn't make sense.	Seo ha se etse kelello.
And eating with other people.	Le ho ja le batho ba bang.
They will have to save another day.	Ba tla tlameha ho boloka letsatsi le leng hape.
He works hard every day.	O sebetsa ka thata letsatsi le letsatsi.
Then if you do not care.	Joale haeba u sa tsotelle.
Sleep, baby.	Robala, ngoana.
And he was the only one who knew.	'Me ke eena feela ea neng a tseba.
I see no reason to give it up now.	Ha ke bone lebaka la ho e tlohela hona joale.
He has to come.	O lokela ho tla.
Sometimes it is, and sometimes it is not.	Ka linako tse ling ho joalo, 'me ka linako tse ling ha u joalo.
He certainly knew that was not true.	Ka sebele o ne a tseba hore seo hase ’nete.
You could have done more.	O ka be o entse ho feta.
We were not very close.	Re ne re se haufi haholo.
Apparently his request does not address this issue.	Ho bonahala eka kopo ea hae ha e bue ka taba ena.
Can you look at that quickly.	Na u ka sheba taba eo kapele.
Maybe there was some benefit to doing nothing.	Mohlomong ho ne ho e-na le molemo o itseng oa ho se etse letho.
The woman is always to blame.	Mosali ke eena ea molato kamehla.
Tired, they come back.	Ba khathetse, ba khutla.
I was going to see people.	Ke ne ke ilo bona batho.
We do not need your place.	Ha re hloke sebaka sa hau.
Her mother cried.	Mme wa hae a lla.
But be careful not to use too much.	Empa hlokomela hore u se ke ua sebelisa haholo.
That's all there is to it.	Ke tsona feela taba.
I paused for a moment.	Ke ile ka ema hanyane.
Wearing it was not an easy task for me.	Ho apara e ne e se taba e bonolo ho ’na.
Which someone no one loves.	E leng motho eo ho seng motho ea mo ratang.
This is better than that.	Sena se molemo ho feta.
But there are times.	Empa ho na le linako.
One, he works hard all the time.	E 'ngoe, o sebetsa ka thata ka linako tsohle.
The most important thing.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ho feta.
He says he knows you and you will help him.	O re oa u tseba 'me u tla mo thusa.
That is why he does this.	Ke ka hona a etsang sena.
So it was me.	Kahoo e ne e le 'na.
So take it from there.	Kahoo e nke ho tloha moo.
He did not know what to do.	O ne a sa tsebe seo ba lokelang ho se etsa.
I just stood there.	Ke ile ka ema feela.
His job makes him travel almost always.	Mosebetsi oa hae o etsa hore a tsamaee hoo e ka bang kamehla.
I would love to hear from you so much.	Nka thabela ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena haholo.
Your father asked you.	Ntate oa hao o ile a u botsa.
It would be better for me to go too.	Ho molemo hore le 'na ke tsamaee.
But it is very difficult for me.	Empa ho thata haholo ho nna.
Another great job.	Mosebetsi o mong o moholo.
Clearly, there is no danger.	Ho hlakile hore kotsi ha e eo.
He started saying something.	A qala ho bua ho hong.
That's what you need.	Ke seo u se hlokang.
Everyone seems to have a personality.	E mong le e mong o bonahala a na le motho.
But, he went on, this is not the case.	Empa, o ile a tsoela pele, sena ha se joalo.
I couldn’t do it, though.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e etsa, leha ho le joalo.
The two of them were close.	Bobeli ba bona ba ne ba le haufi.
I don't think so.	Ha ke nahane hantle.
I want to know what happened there.	Ke batla ho tseba se etsahetseng moo.
Still, they seemed happy and cheerful.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba bonahala ba thabile ba bile ba thabile.
There are people on the floor.	Ho na le batho fatše.
But he was a good dog.	Empa e ne e le ntja e ntle.
He says.	O bolela.
And so this is what you did.	'Me kahoo sena ke seo u se entseng.
They are things.	Ke lintho.
Where are you going now?	O tla ea kae hona joale.
Once again maybe.	Hang hape mohlomong.
That's what he was eating.	Ke seo a neng a ntse a se ja.
You can do this.	Sena u ka se etsa.
He knew that people loved him.	O ne a tseba hore batho baa mo rata.
The way he looked.	Ka tsela eo a neng a shebahala ka teng.
He would have to do all he could.	O ne a tla tlameha ho etsa sohle seo a ka se khonang.
They were very happy.	Ba ne ba thabile haholo.
He looked better tonight.	O ne a shebahala a le betere bosiung bona.
Let's not forget them.	Re se ke ra ba lebala.
You do not have to do everything yourself.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u etse ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe u le mong.
It has something for everything.	E na le ho hong bakeng sa ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
Of course nothing was happening.	Ehlile ho ne ho se letho le etsahalang.
I don't know what's going on.	Ha ke tsebe se etsahalang.
The grass was wet.	Joang bo ne bo le metsi.
None of us know what happened to them.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea tsebang se ileng sa etsahala ka bona.
It was obviously too long.	Ho hlakile hore e ne e le telele haholo.
But be careful.	Empa hlokomela.
There was nothing more I could say.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng leo nka le buang.
Nothing and everything at once.	Ha ho letho le tsohle ka nako e le 'ngoe.
They play mind in you.	Ba bapala kelello ho uena.
The life they had lived together seemed sweet to her.	Bophelo boo ba neng ba bo phela hammoho bo ne bo bonahala bo le monate ho eena.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o tla fihla mona haufinyane.
They were amazing people.	E ne e le batho ba makatsang.
I did not expect such things.	Ha kea lebella lintho tse joalo.
He had made his decision.	O ne a entse qeto ya hae.
He probably has only one son.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe o na le mora a le mong feela.
I can see why you might reach that conclusion.	Kea bona hore na ke hobane'ng ha u ka fihlela qeto eo.
So let's be sensible.	Kahoo a re be le kelello.
But they did nothing.	Empa ha ba a etsa letho.
That won't help him.	Ntho eo e ke ke ya mo thusa.
It came back strong.	E ile ea khutla ka matla.
He just never got there.	Feela ha a ka a fihla moo.
Then he went back.	Eaba o khutlela morao.
I see the problem.	Ke bona bothata.
So it goes on.	Kahoo e tsoela pele.
I do not know how to proceed.	Ha ke tsebe ho tsoela pele.
Not good, either.	Ha ho molemo, mohlomong.
I went there years ago.	Ke ile moo lilemo tse fetileng.
They looked good.	Li ne li shebahala li le ntle.
He said he would like that well.	A re a ka rata seo hantle.
Their pain is your pain.	Bohloko ba bona ke bohloko ba hao.
As soon as we arrive, the party begins.	Hang ha re fihla, mokete oa qala.
It is never easy.	Ha ho mohla ho leng bonolo.
This place is something else.	Sebaka sena ke ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Now, it's not that easy.	Jwale, ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
You did not know anyone here.	O ne o sa tsebe motho mona.
But that was not the case.	Empa hoo ho ne ho sa etsahala hakaalo.
We only understand why it happens.	Re utloisisa feela hore na ke hobane'ng ha e etsahala.
But it is very important.	Empa ke ea bohlokoa haholo.
So here it is.	Kahoo ke ena.
I have to continue with my work.	Ke tlameha ho tsoela pele ka mosebetsi oa ka.
He does not want to talk.	Ha a batle ho bua.
It seemed years before they could reach that area.	Ho ne ho bonahala e le lilemo pele ba ka fihla sebakeng seo.
Some of you will know it.	Ba bang ba lona ba tla e tseba.
I think we were a better team.	Ke nahana hore re ne re le sehlopha se betere.
He wants to get started.	O batla ho qala.
Deciding when to leave is not always easy.	Ho etsa qeto ea hore na u tsamaee neng ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
He needed money.	O ne a hloka chelete.
Do the same old things.	Etsa tsona lintho tsa khale.
He never got a job.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a fumana mosebetsi.
But it's not a thought or something like that.	Empa ha se mohopolo kapa ntho e kang eo.
No, he was not.	Che, o ne a se joalo.
People value time more than anything else.	Batho ba nka nako e le ea bohlokoa ho feta ntho leha e le efe.
I wondered who he was.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na ke mang.
He is only with me.	O na le nna feela.
A little more.	Ho feta hanyane.
If you have time.	Haeba u na le nako.
He had his money, he was well dressed, and he was driving a new car.	O ne a e-na le chelete ea hae, a apara hantle, ’me a khanna koloi e ncha.
I'm just going to get dressed.	Ke mpe ke ilo apara.
I want to be handsome.	Ke batla ho ba matsoho.
It will be difficult.	Ho tla ba thata.
I do not know him well.	Ha ke mo tsebe hantle.
For each group.	Bakeng sa sehlopha ka seng.
Here are some things to think about.	Mona ke lintho tse itseng tseo u li nahanang.
They knew they were dangerous.	Ba ne ba tseba hore ba kotsi.
He came to me.	A tla ho nna.
More than that he wanted it to be visible.	Ho feta moo o ne a batla hore e bonahale.
It's near the road.	Le haufi le tsela.
Once a week is fun.	Hang ka beke ho monate.
They were too many.	Ba ne ba le bangata haholo.
She returned home happy from school.	O ile a khutlela hae a tsoa sekolong a thabile.
That was thirty years ago.	E ne e le lilemo tse mashome a mararo tse fetileng.
I did not know what to do about it.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke etse eng ka hona.
I will find another way.	Ke tla fumana tsela e 'ngoe.
For some, it will be a very new experience.	Ho ba bang, e tla ba ntho e ncha haholo.
However, we were unable to continue with him.	Leha ho le joalo, ha rea ​​ka ra khona ho tsoela pele le eena.
Doing so properly takes time.	Ho etsa seo hantle ho nka nako.
This was not one of those times.	Ena e ne e se e 'ngoe ea linako tseo.
I have no children.	Ha ke na bana.
Lifestyle alone.	Mokhoa oa ho phela ke le mong.
Such is the case here.	Boemo bo joalo mona.
It was really hard.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le thata.
I felt lonely because of that.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke le mong ka lebaka la seo.
She could keep it next to her in her room.	O ne a ka e boloka haufi le eena ka kamoreng ea hae.
This situation occurs for a reason.	Boemo bona bo etsahala ka lebaka.
You know not to say yes or no.	Ua tseba u se ke ua re e kapa che.
I think we can have a lot in common.	Ke nahana hore re ka ba le lintho tse ngata tse tšoanang.
Surprisingly often.	Ho makatsang hangata.
Thank you, man.	Kea leboha, monna.
The children will come and go.	Bana ba tla ba tsamaea.
It would be fun.	Ho ne ho tla ba monate.
It can be other things as we work.	E ka ba lintho tse ling ha re ntse re sebetsa.
So that they can do what they want.	E le hore ba ka etsa seo ba se ratang.
He worked very well.	O ne a sebetsa hantle haholo.
He gives one more week, maybe.	O fana ka beke e 'ngoe hape, mohlomong.
What are you going to do?	U tlo etsang?
Good, maybe.	Molemo, mohlomong.
Better than before.	E betere ho feta pele.
It really makes you want to go there !.	Ehlile e etsa hore u batle ho ea moo!.
It was so.	Ho ne ho le joalo.
It was fun to play.	Ho ne ho le monate ho bapala.
He really didn't think of them now.	O ne a hlile a sa nahane ka bona jwale.
I'm sorry, but someone has to tell you.	Ke masoabi, empa ho na le motho ea lokelang ho u bolella.
It is possible that many such people are still alive today.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe batho ba joalo ba bangata ba ntse ba phela le kajeno.
I always want the worst.	Ke lula ke batla tse mpe ka ho fetisisa.
They feel hard.	Ba utloa ka thata.
I hope that has been helpful.	Ke tšepa hore seo se bile molemo.
I thought you knew that, too.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tseba seo, le wena.
I'm just a girl.	Ke ngoanana feela.
It was always fun to watch him.	Ho ne ho lula ho le monate ho mo shebella.
The rest is here.	Tse ling kaofela li mona.
That is what we need.	Ke seo re se hlokang.
Maybe he too is someone who can do anything.	Mohlomong le eena ke motho ea ka etsang eng kapa eng.
As long as never again.	Ha feela le ka mohla hape.
But we really don't know how much time we have.	Empa ha e le hantle ha re tsebe hore na re na le nako e kae.
That is what happened.	Ke sona se ileng sa etsahala.
Some things just happened.	Lintho tse ling li sa tsoa etsahala.
Like me, he looked great.	Joaloka 'na, o ne a shebahala a le moholo.
If nothing else.	Haeba ha ho letho le leng.
And it works very well.	Mme e sebetsa hantle haholo.
Yes, that's right.	Joalo, ho joalo.
I need your help for it.	Ke hloka thuso ea hau bakeng sa eona.
There are so many things here.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata mona.
He was almost one of them now.	E ne e batla e le e mong oa bona joale.
I did not want to ask.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho botsa.
Now more than ever.	Hona joale ho feta leha e le neng pele.
Well, almost everything.	Hantle, hoo e ka bang tsohle.
This is more important than me.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa ho feta ho 'na.
It was indeed a painful time.	Ka sebele e ne e le nako e bohloko.
Your teacher went away for a long time.	Tichere ea hau e ile ea tsamaea nako e telele.
Isn't that great.	Na ha e ntle.
People want to help.	Batho ba batla ho thusa.
When he sent his son away, his father wept.	Ha a re mora oa hae a tsamaee, ntate oa hae a lla.
Nice to see you.	Ke thabela ho o bona.
When you arrive.	Ha o fihla.
I think the idea works.	Ke nahana hore mohopolo oa sebetsa.
Get out !.	Kena ka ntle!.
We talked about the same issues.	Re ile ra bua ka litaba tse tšoanang.
We can't go.	Re ke ke ra tsamaea.
But once you do, you will be glad you did!	Empa hang ha u etsa joalo, u tla thabela hore ebe u entse joalo!
I don't know if he ever noticed that.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o kile a hlokomela seo.
The return was a mistake.	Ho khutla e bile phoso.
She is crying too.	Le eena oa lla.
This will not be difficult for me.	Sena se ke ke sa ba thata ho 'na.
It's easy to find, but it's also easy to do.	Ho bonolo ho e fumana, empa hape ho bonolo ho e etsa.
He said nothing, but looked at her sadly.	Ha aa ka a bua letho, empa a mo sheba ka masoabi.
Trust people who like it.	Tšepa batho ba e rata.
And easy to understand.	Le ho bonolo ho utloisisa.
Some are old and some are new.	Tse ling ke tsa khale ha tse ling li ncha.
I took the baby first.	Ke ile ka nka ngoana pele.
We should not talk about it here.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho bua ka eona mona.
I'm glad you're better.	Ke thabela hore o betere.
It was his job to travel.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa hae ho tsamaea.
But something unusual happened next.	Empa ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang.
He started driving.	O ile a qala ho khanna.
Maybe better for me in some way.	Mohlomong molemo ho 'na ka tsela e itseng.
He knew these people and their lives.	O ne a tseba batho bana le bophelo ba bona.
Just please, go.	Feela ka kopo, tsamaea.
I would like to help.	Nka rata ho thusa.
But really, there is nothing wrong with that.	Empa ha e le hantle, ha ho letho le phoso ka seo.
Or children.	Kapa bana.
I could read that.	Ke ne ke khona ho bala seo.
When he arrived home, he found that the house was empty.	Ha a fihla hae, a fumana ntlo e se na motho.
Doing something is something.	Ho etsa ntho ke ntho e itseng.
And so the people had never seen anything like it.	Mme ka hona batho ba ne ba eso bone ntho e kang ena.
He saw nothing.	Ha a ka a bona letho .
And she says.	Mme o re.
I needed to get out of it.	Ke ne ke hloka ho tsoa ho eona.
Expect that.	Ho lebella seo.
I look at things a little bit.	Ke sheba lintho hanyane hanyane.
So off he went.	Kahoo a tloha a tloha.
I did not know how to do it today.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe mokhoa oa ho e etsa kajeno.
They just do things.	Ba etsa lintho feela.
He had not yet agreed to take the job.	O ne a e-s’o lumele le ho nka mosebetsi oo.
Now he was even older.	Joale o ne a le moholo ho feta moo.
He grabbed his books.	O ile a tšoara libuka tsa hae.
We certainly have many good things today.	Ka sebele re na le lintho tse ngata tse molemo tsa kajeno.
She was very scared of the dog.	O ne a tšaba ntja haholo.
Of course, he would.	Ehlile, o ne a tla etsa joalo.
He walked to work every day.	O ne a tsamaea ka maoto ho ea mosebetsing letsatsi le leng le le leng.
Soon, they are back together and happy.	Ho e-s’o ee kae, ba khutlela hammoho ’me ba thabile.
How do we really know what is really going on?	Ha e le hantle re tseba joang seo e leng ’nete?
I know them well.	Ke ba tseba hantle.
We did not know what he did.	Re ne re sa tsebe seo a se entseng.
He just kept coming.	A nna a tla feela.
He wanted to be strong.	O ne a batla ho ba le matla.
The phone was already ringing.	Mohala o ne o se o ntse o lla.
Lots of things to think about.	Lintho tse ngata tseo u ka nahanang ka tsona.
I realize everything that happened.	Ke hlokomela tsohle tse etsahetseng.
He is a very good player.	Ke sebapali se setle haholo.
He does amazing things.	O etsa ka tsela e makatsang.
He can't even speak well.	Ha a khone le ho bua hantle.
Can we do this?	Na re ka etsa see?
We know these things are true.	Rea tseba hore lintho tsena ke ’nete.
The real thing.	Ntho ya sebele.
Then he was gone.	Joale o ne a ile.
There was a lot of money.	Ho ne ho e-na le chelete e ngata haholo.
He could have done worse things.	O ne a ka etsa lintho tse mpe le ho feta.
Good friends to each other.	Metsoalle e molemo e mong ho e mong.
We tried to find him.	Re ile ra leka ho mo fumana.
We travel as smoothly as we can.	Re tsamaea hantle kamoo re ka khonang.
What would you like to do?	U ka rata ho etsa eng?
You know why it happened.	Ua tseba hore na hobaneng ho bile joalo.
And somehow, that's right.	Mme ka tsela e itseng, ho jwalo.
However, you do not know what it is.	Leha ho le joalo, ha u tsebe hore na ke eng.
All my life.	Bophelo bohle ba ka.
You probably do not even know it exists.	Mohlomong ha o tsebe le hore e teng.
Time will go by.	Nako e tla ya pele.
It was tough for the team.	Ho ne ho le boima bakeng sa sehlopha.
The question is whether they want you here.	Potso ke hore na ba u batla mona.
We could not do that now.	Re ne re ke ke ra etsa hoo hona jwale.
But that is exactly what you need.	Empa ke sona seo u se hlokang haholo.
He did not know what to do next.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng hape.
You want my help.	U batla thuso ea ka.
It seemed so.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le jwalo.
They would need them next year.	Ba ne ba tla li hloka selemong se tlang.
I try not to think.	Ke leka ho se nahane.
We use them a lot.	Re li sebelisa haholo.
We will take care of them.	Re tla ba hlokomela.
Never let anyone think you have your own mind.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua lumella mang kapa mang hore a nahane hore u na le kelello ea hau.
It should not be so.	Ha hoa lokela ho ba joalo.
He knew what he wanted.	O ne a tseba seo a se batlang.
I do not want to see them.	Ha ke batle ho bona.
I was happy.	Ke ne ke thabile.
No, that's not a problem.	Che, ha se bothata.
She thanked him.	A mo leboha.
I wanted that.	Ke ne ke batla seo.
Although you did not plan on it, everything went well.	Le hoja u ne u sa rera ka eona, tsohle li ile tsa tsamaea hantle.
I just know he's coming here.	Ke tseba feela hore o tla mona.
I had no idea they did the second one.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore ba entse ea bobeli.
Still, he seemed to be a good child.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a bonahala e le ngoana ea molemo.
I drink from it.	Ke noa ho eona.
But they know that.	Empa ba tseba seo.
I will not.	Nke ke ka etsa joalo.
It tells me what to do.	E mpolella seo ke lokelang ho se etsa.
They can't see.	Ba ke ke ba bona.
There are a lot of people there.	Ho na le batho ba bangata moo.
It was exactly what he expected.	E ne e le seo a neng a se lebeletse.
Not much, he thought.	Ha e ngata, a nahana.
I look down at my mother.	Ke sheba 'Mè fatše.
Write because you have to.	Ngola hobane u tlameha ho.
Of course you don't have to work.	Ha e le hantle ha ua lokela ho sebetsa.
Maybe it's time to move on.	Mohlomong ke nako ea ho tsoela pele.
He agreed to try it.	O ile a lumela ho e leka.
He did not know anyone there, and no one knew him.	O ne a sa tsebe motho moo, mme ho ne ho se motho ya mo tsebang.
This dog just gets it.	Ntja ena e mpa e e fumana.
I don't want anything from you.	Ha ke batle letho la hao.
You should read my books.	U lokela ho bala libuka tsa ka.
I do not understand what he wants.	Ha ke utloisise seo a se batlang.
I'm sorry to see it.	Ke masoabi ha u e bona.
But she is not even sure about that.	Empa ha a na bonnete le ka seo.
And so it is with your children.	Mme ho jwalo le ho bana ba hao.
Some may do a certain job.	Ba bang ba ka sebelisa mosebetsi o itseng.
He didn't come in.	O ne a sa kena.
Let's see what happens.	A re bone se etsahalang.
He met me.	O ne a kopana le nna.
I didn't know much about it but I knew it wasn't.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hakaalo ka eona empa ke ne ke tseba hore ha ho joalo.
They will not even know that he exists.	Ba ka se tsebe le hore o teng.
I did not take it.	Ha kea ka ka e nka.
Yet here I am.	Leha ho le joalo ke mona.
One of the many.	E 'ngoe ea tse ngata.
You know what you need to do.	U tseba seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
I like when people have their own style.	Ke rata ha batho ba e-na le mokhoa oa bona oa mokhoa.
He could say that it would be better.	A ka re ho ka ba betere.
And of course you can see what it looks like.	'Me ehlile u ka bona hore na e shebahala joang.
Your hair looks beautiful.	Moriri oa hau o shebahala o le motle.
I got to know many of them well.	Ke ile ka tseba ba bangata ba bona hantle.
It is important to all of us in that way.	Ke oa bohlokoa ho rona kaofela ka tsela eo.
I have a better idea.	Ke na le mohopolo o betere.
If you have a problem, speak up.	Haeba u na le bothata, bua.
Maybe he was there.	Mohlomong o ne a le teng.
He was happy about it.	O ne a thabile ka hona.
Can you suggest what might happen?	A na u ka fana ka maikutlo a hore na ho ka etsahala eng?
So it was really hard.	Kahoo ho ne ho hlile ho le thata.
I just want you to think about it with me.	Ke batla feela hore o nahane ka taba ena le nna.
And now look at me.	Mme jwale sheba ho nna.
That was really fun.	Seo se ne se le monate haholo.
In the end, you can't win the place.	Qetellong, u ke ke ua hlola sebaka.
It's an idea.	Ke maikutlo.
It seems to be working well so far.	Ho bonahala e sebetsa hantle ho fihlela joale.
Some are good at one or the other.	Ba bang ba hantle ho e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe.
I like the idea.	Ke rata mohopolo.
He initially refused, and then he agreed.	O ile a qala ka ho hana eaba o lumela.
He didn't really care for her.	O ne a sa mo tsotelle hakaalo.
It didn't have to be that way.	E ne e sa lokela ho ba jwalo.
Their lives are in danger.	Bophelo ba bona bo kotsing.
He was an expert.	E ne e le setsebi.
They have never sat in a day.	Ha ba e-s'o ka ba lula ka letsatsi.
I thought maybe you could do something about it.	Ke ne ke nahana hore mohlomong u ka etsa ho hong ka eona.
It seemed too good to be true.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le monate haholo hore e ka ba ’nete.
Or to others.	Kapa ho ba bang.
This would help them too.	Sena se ne se tla thusa le bona.
What can I tell you, though.	Ke tla o bolella eng, leha ho le jwalo.
And, in the end, it probably was the best.	'Me, qetellong, mohlomong e bile molemo ka ho fetisisa.
They are very fun to write.	Li monate haholo ho li ngola.
'Time' is very important.	'Nako' ke ea bohlokoa haholo.
I was able to do that.	Ke ile ka khona ho etsa joalo.
I had to see it.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho o bona.
It's as wet as any other.	E metsi joalo ka e 'ngoe hape.
There was never a give and take.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba le ho fana le ho nka.
It is a state of mind.	Ke boemo ba kelello.
He did not like it.	O ne a sa e rate.
These are amazing people.	Bana ke batho ba makatsang.
You get to live.	U fumana ho phela.
We would stay again if we were in the area.	Re ne re tla lula hape haeba re le sebakeng seo.
Like.	Joalo ka.
And he loves her.	Mme o a mo rata.
Eventually you will get a chance.	Qetellong o tla fumana monyetla.
I'll just go home.	Ke tla ea hae feela.
But nothing works.	Empa ha ho letho le etsang.
It is too late.	Nako e se e le morao haholo.
By phone.	Ka mohala.
Simple is the best.	Ka sebele e bonolo ke eona e molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Mine does not.	Ea ka ha e etse joalo.
It's fun before that name.	Ho monate pele ho lebitso leo.
Everything you could really need.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe eo u ka e hlokang ha e le hantle.
When we leave.	Ha re tloha.
She would only see him as one.	O ne a tla mo bona feela e le ea tšoanang le eena.
You will not have to do this alone.	U ke ke ua tlameha ho etsa sena u le mong.
To me it was fun.	Ho 'na e ne e le monate.
But that was not enough.	Empa hoo ho ne ho sa lekana.
People may call friends and family to watch.	Batho ba ka 'na ba letsetsa metsoalle le ba lelapa ho shebella.
It is not always easy, but it is really important.	Hase kamehla ho leng bonolo, empa ho hlile ho bohlokoa.
I'm glad to know.	Ke thabela ho tseba.
I hope you come back to read this.	Ke tšepa hore u tla khutla ho bala sena.
I slept alone.	Ke ne ke robala ke le mong.
He was a local boy.	E ne e le moshanyana oa moo.
It was just fun to write.	E ne e le monate feela ho ngola.
I doubt, be careful.	Kea belaela, hlokomela.
My son.	Mora oa ka.
From them.	Ho tsoa ho tsona.
Opportunity outside, as you might say.	Monyetla o ka ntle, joalo ka ha u ka bua.
Yes, nothing seems to have happened.	E, ho bonahala eka ha ho letho le etsahetseng.
I too stood up.	Le nna ka ema.
I don't know what happened to you.	Ha ke tsebe se etsahetseng ho wena.
Maybe I still do.	Mohlomong ke ntse ke etsa joalo.
You will soon forget them.	U tla li lebala kapele.
I would be the first to do it.	Ke ne ke tla ba oa pele ho e etsa.
They are just as important.	Ke tsa bohlokoa feela.
He enjoyed using it and knew it well.	O ne a thabela ho e sebelisa ’me a e tseba hantle.
It's just there to look at it.	E teng feela ho e sheba.
We'll see what it looks like when we play.	Re tla bona hore na e shebahala joang ha re bapala.
What made you decide to come today?	Ke eng e entseng hore u nke qeto ea ho tla kajeno?
I stand up again.	Ke ema hape.
But it will happen.	Empa ho tla etsahala.
There was nothing important to say about it.	Ho ne ho se letho la bohlokoa leo u ka le buang ka eona.
We're just going to take it.	Re ea e nka feela.
This is the reality of our lives.	Sena ke 'nete ea bophelo ba rona.
To the end.	Ho fihlela qetellong.
It would have to do that.	E ne e tla tlameha ho etsa joalo.
You are doing that.	U ntse u etsa joalo.
I have never seen anyone.	Ha ke eso bone motho.
We do not think such a thing could happen.	Ha re nahane hore ntho e joalo e ka etsahala.
Life can only mean life.	Bophelo bo ka bua bophelo feela.
Nothing is so simple.	Ha ho letho le bonolo joalo.
I can't help it.	Ha ke khone ho e thusa.
It may live, but it may not live.	E ka ’na ea phela, empa e ka ’na ea se ke ea phela.
There are more of us than them.	Ho na le ba bangata ba rona ho feta bona.
Only now did she understand why.	Ke hona joale a ileng a utloisisa lebaka.
You know, that's nothing.	Ua tseba, e leng letho.
And it did not seem that easy.	Mme ho ne ho sa bonahale eka ho tla ba bonolo.
I'll go in with you, though.	Ke tla kena le uena, leha ho le joalo.
Yes, one can never go back to the past.	E, motho a ke ke a khutlela morao nakong e fetileng.
I knew we would be together again.	Ke ne ke tseba hore re tla ba hammoho hape.
However, no one really understood what was going on.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho ea neng a utloisisa hantle se etsahalang.
No, of course not, but it does feel that way.	Che, ha e le hantle, empa e ikutloa joalo.
Sometimes people go without food or water for days.	Ka linako tse ling batho ba qeta matsatsi ba se na lijo kapa metsi.
Where he would probably live.	Moo mohlomong a neng a tla lula teng.
We learned them.	Re ile ra ithuta tsona.
I don't like you, I don't.	Ha ke u rate, ha ho joalo.
I have done this so far.	Ke entse sena ho fihlela joale.
I thought you would think so.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tla nahana jwalo.
I loved my mother.	Ke ne ke rata ’Mè.
I want to be me.	Ke batla ho ba nna.
That would be very grateful.	Seo se ka leboha haholo.
Most of us will not.	Ba bangata ba rōna re ke ke.
I met other people.	Ke kopane le batho ba bang.
But there is nothing more than writing.	Empa ha ho letho ka ho ngola feela.
They are useless.	Ha li na thuso.
This can go both ways, too.	Sena se ka tsamaea ka bobeli, hape.
Then they had it.	Joale ba ne ba e-na le eona.
I give it to you.	Kea u fa eona.
This is hard work.	Ona ke mosebetsi o boima.
It took me a while to get home.	Ke nkile nako ho fihla hae.
Please think about that.	Ke kopa o nahane ka seo.
Thanks head.	Ke leboha hlooho.
That is what we need to know.	Ke seo re lokelang ho se tseba.
I can't go any further.	Nke ke ka tsoela pele ho feta moo.
As a result, he had to work hard.	Ka lebaka leo, o ile a tlameha ho sebetsa ka thata.
Again, we do not know.	Hape, ha re tsebe.
The rest were in front.	Ba bang kaofela ba ne ba le ka pele.
And they know a lot about what they do.	'Me ba tseba haholo ka seo ba se etsang.
He seemed really looking for someone to talk to.	O ne a bonahala a hlile a batla motho eo a ka buang le eena.
Living there is even more difficult.	Ho lula moo ho thata le ho feta.
There was no chance that he would survive.	Ho ne ho se na monyetla oa hore a ka phela.
One new, one old.	E 'ngoe e ncha, e' ngoe ea khale.
This is the easiest type to use.	Ena ke mofuta o bonolo oa ho o sebelisa.
It can't happen.	E ke ke ea etsahala.
I like that in the morning.	Ke rata seo hoseng.
Or that he should do the same for them.	Kapa hore le eena a etse se tšoanang ho bona.
I'm going there.	Ke ea moo.
We do what we can.	Re etsa seo re ka se khonang.
There are times when you.	Ho na le linako tseo u.
This dog loves to play.	Ntja ena e rata ho bapala.
I'm not going to that place.	Ha ke ee sebakeng seo.
Then the law would be.	Joale molao e ne e tla ba.
He had his life in them.	O ne a na le bophelo ba hae ho tsona.
Of course it is his first.	Ke 'nete hore ke ea hae ea pele.
No, not one of them, any of them.	Che, ha ho e 'ngoe ea tsona, leha e le efe ea tsona.
This is my heritage.	Ena ke lefa la ka.
Drinking, therefore, is not your problem.	Ho noa, ka hona, ha se bothata ba hau.
My father was also present.	Ntate le eena o ne a le teng.
So this too will pass.	Kahoo sena le sona se tla feta.
It took so long that it was fun.	E ile ea nka nako e telele hoo e ileng ea e-ba monate.
How do you do it.	U e etsa joang.
We see that.	Re bona seo.
Children are always curious about things.	Bana ba lula ba batla ho tseba lintho.
Of course, they did not go the other way.	Ke ’nete hore ha baa ka ba tsamaea ka tsela e ’ngoe.
It is very important.	E bohlokoa haholo.
He says it.	O a e bolela.
It's a very bad thing.	Ke ntho e mpe haholo.
There seems to be something here.	Eka ho na le se seng mona.
It was a foolish thing to do.	E ne e le ntho e hlokang kelello ho e etsa.
When he finally got into high school, he was tired.	Qetellong ha a kena sekolong se phahameng, o ne a khathetse.
He tried to sleep, but nothing happened.	O ile a leka ho robala, empa ha hoa ka ha etsahala.
I know little about what it does.	Ke tseba hanyane seo e se etsang.
We are working.	Re ntse re sebetsa.
I know they have nothing to say about the good.	Kea tseba hore ha ba na seo ba se buang ka se molemo.
She said she feels much better.	O ile a re o ikutloa a le betere haholo.
Take good care of something good.	Hlokomela hantle ntho e ntle.
You want to help in some way.	U batla ho thusa ka tsela e itseng.
We are a man and a woman.	Re monna le mosali.
They looked very lonely.	Ba ne ba shebahala ba le bolutu haholo.
By doing this.	Ka ho etsa sena.
Which is what he did.	E leng seo a se entseng.
He bought new shoes.	O ile a reka lieta tse ncha.
Why now ?.	Hobaneng hona joale?.
We never talked about it.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra bua ka eona.
This is very good.	Sena se setle haholo.
So we just have to do it.	Kahoo re tlameha ho etsa joalo feela.
I am sure it is the only one that exists.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ke eona feela e teng.
One of them was better than this.	E 'ngoe ea tsona e ne e le betere ho feta ena.
He needed to know what was going on.	O ne a lokela ho tseba se etsahalang.
But some get only the bad ones.	Empa ba bang ba fumana tse mpe feela.
He did not live.	Ha a ka a phela.
If only you could work a little harder.	Hoja feela o ka sebetsa hanyane.
I like old books.	Ke rata libuka tsa khale.
There are several problems.	Ho na le mathata a 'maloa.
That has never happened before.	Seo ha se e-so ka se etsahala pele.
Leave work as soon as you arrive.	Tloha mosebetsing hang ha u fihla.
I found out who he was.	Ke ile ka fumana hore na ke mang.
They are not dangerous at all.	Ha li kotsi ho hang.
This is amazing.	Sena ke ka mokhoa o makatsang.
It knows more than that.	E tseba ho feta moo.
It only says when we will start.	E re feela re tla qala neng.
Finally, they stopped.	Qetellong, ba ile ba ema.
We just got in.	Re sa tsoa kena.
But today, this is the worst.	Empa kajeno, sena se mpe ka ho fetisisa.
His feelings for her are clear.	Maikutlo a hae ho eena a hlakile.
Yes, it would.	E, ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
What kind of food, how much food.	Ke mofuta ofe oa lijo, lijo tse kae.
Then I realized my mistake.	Eaba ke bona phoso ea ka.
This works best when you know what you want.	Sena se sebetsa hantle ha o tseba seo o se batlang.
I do not know where it is.	Ha ke tsebe moo e leng teng.
Life is hard there.	Bophelo bo boima moo.
Because it is now.	Hobane ho jwalo jwale.
This is up to you first.	Sena ke ho uena pele.
Try to eat more often.	Leka ho ja hangata.
It asks why we do what we do.	E botsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha re etsa seo re se etsang.
I needed to read this today.	Ke ne ke hloka ho bala sena kajeno.
None of us know who you are.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea tsebang seo u leng sona.
He starts here.	O qala mona.
It can't be me.	E ke ke ea e-ba 'na.
You can feel it coming.	O khona ho e utloa e tla.
I, for one, am the last.	'Na, ka lekhetlo le leng, ke oa morao.
That can be difficult and dangerous.	Seo se ka ba thata le ho ba kotsi.
I feel it works in me.	Ke e utloa e sebetsa ka ho nna.
I am not well.	ha kea phela hantle.
For many, this can be a fun place to visit.	Bakeng sa ba bangata, sena e ka ba sebaka se monate sa ho etela.
It’s a mental image you have of yourself.	Ke setšoantšo sa kelello seo u nang le sona ka uena.
You too should say something nice.	Le uena u lokela ho bua ntho e ntle.
I'm eating a little.	Ke ntse ke ja hanyane.
The man was very nice.	Monna eo o ne a le motle haholo.
And they were mine now.	Mme e ne e le ba ka jwale.
So he finally left.	Kahoo qetellong a tsamaea.
You are the problem here.	Ke uena bothata mona.
I had no idea he was trying.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore oa leka.
I need energy for other things.	Ke hloka matla a lintho tse ling.
Why do you pass at all.	Ke hobane'ng ha u feta ho hang.
You will need new shoes.	O tla hloka lieta tse ncha.
All the time.	Ka linako tsohle.
Clearly, he had a sense of humor.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a e-na le maikutlo.
But it was just me.	Empa ho ne ho na le nna feela.
He can do as he pleases.	A ka etsa kamoo a ratang kateng.
No problem there.	Haho bothata moo.
However, when you need them, they are not available.	Leha ho le joalo, ha u li hloka, ha li eo.
You need something, talk to me.	O hloka ho hong, bua le nna.
Very good for me there.	Ho molemo haholo ho nna moo.
There are probably three.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe tse tharo.
Such a sweet girl.	Ngoanana ea monate joalo.
We have been waiting for this for a long time.	Ke nako e telele re emetse sena.
We try to make it easy.	Re leka ho etsa hore ho be bonolo.
I've been there, done that.	Ke bile moo, ke entse seo.
That's probably what always happens.	Ke seo mohlomong se etsahalang kamehla.
They told us about the bad food.	Ba ile ba re bolella ka lijo tse mpe.
But he did not just stare.	Empa ha a ka a sheba feela.
We saw nothing.	Re ne re sa bone letho.
One for everyone.	E 'ngoe bakeng sa e mong le e mong.
I thought it could be so.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho ka ba joalo.
When we have a date.	Ha re na le letsatsi.
He says he is there too.	O re le eena o teng.
They will not work.	Ba ke ke ba sebetsa.
I need to do this.	Ke hloka ho etsa sena.
I could pay a lot of money for this.	Nka lefa chelete e ngata bakeng sa sena.
So honestly and truthfully, we never went without it.	Kahoo ka 'nete le ka 'nete, ha ho mohla re kileng ra tsamaea ntle le eona.
Often, the law seems to work.	Hangata, molao o bonahala o sebetsa.
There is really strange news here.	Ho na le litaba tse makatsang ruri mona.
You should not drink too much coffee.	Ha ua lokela ho noa kofi e ngata haholo.
He will never speak to me again.	Ha a sa tla hlola a bua le nna.
Do not keep us living too long.	U se ke ua re boloka re phela nako e telele haholo.
Soon we will be able to walk around the area.	Haufinyane re tla khona ho tsamaea sebakeng.
It's just for me.	Ke bakeng sa ka feela.
I like to get ideas.	Ke rata ho fumana maikutlo.
But this is clear.	Empa sena se hlakile.
People come in.	Batho ba kena.
That's his condition.	Ke boemo ba hae.
And so it is.	'Me ho joalo.
Always do one thing at a time.	Kamehla etsa ntho e le 'ngoe ka nako.
That is, he could if he had the opportunity to.	Ke hore, a ka khona ha a ka fumana monyetla oa ho.
I have no idea what it is.	Ha ke na maikutlo a letho ka eona.
No one would know what he did.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tla tseba seo a se entseng.
It was very clear.	Ho ne ho hlakile haholo.
This is too much for me.	Sena se ngata haholo ho nna.
But there is really no way I can say that.	Empa ha e le hantle ha ho mokhoa oa hore nka bolela.
He wanted to know the time.	O ne a batla ho tseba nako.
So it's kind of weird.	Kahoo e batla e le ntho e makatsang.
We will definitely be back !.	Ruri re tla khutla!.
I hope you will check out their location.	Ke tšepa hore u tla sheba sebaka sa bona.
We really like it here.	Re e rata mona hantle.
One coin can't buy it.	Chelete e le 'ngoe e ke ke ea e reka.
He has been arrested and does not know why.	O tšoeroe 'me ha a tsebe lebaka.
My husband is here, too.	Monna oa ka o teng mona, le eena.
You can see why.	U ka bona lebaka.
To know that he is here.	Ho tseba hore o mona.
Moreover, they are very good.	Ho feta moo, li molemo haholo.
And they were all gone.	Mme bohle ba ne ba ile.
This book is very useful.	Buka ena e molemo haholo.
She has been living alone ever since.	O lula a le mong ho tloha ka nako eo.
I want to start.	Ke batla ho qala.
Driving is available.	Ho khanna ho teng.
The woman had just helped him.	Mosali eo o ne a sa tsoa mo thusa.
Or think about them.	Kapa u nahane ka tsona.
He opened the door and went inside.	A bula lemati mme a kena.
The young man was tired.	Mohlankana eo o ne a khathetse.
I don’t think why it could be.	Ha ke nahane lebaka leo e ka bang ka lona.
We have heard them.	Re ba utloile.
You did anything.	U entse eng kapa eng.
It works too.	E sebetsa hape.
I try to help.	Ke leka ho thusa.
It's not that good.	Ha e ntle hakaalo.
It was us or them.	E ne e le rona kapa bona.
Until that night.	Ho fihlela bosiung boo.
That issue is not new.	Taba eo ha se taba e ncha.
She was so beautiful that way.	O ne a le motle haholo ka tsela eo.
It is very important.	E bohlokoa haholo.
I need to do something.	Ke hloka ho etsa ho hong.
They will not work as a team.	Ba ke ke ba sebetsa e le sehlopha.
Looking at them.	Ho ba sheba.
He has become great.	O bile moholo.
That seems obvious to me.	Seo se bonahala se hlakile ho nna.
Work while you wait.	Sebetsa ha u ntse u emetse.
I just think they don’t get it.	Ke mpa ke nahana hore ha ba e fumane.
To be strong.	Ho ba matla.
Sleep problems.	Bothata ba ho robala.
And finally, I will wonder why.	'Me qetellong, ke tla ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng.
He felt tired.	O ile a ikutloa a khathetse.
If the production is good, it does not matter.	Haeba tlhahiso e le ntle, ha ho na taba.
Then came another call.	Joale ha tla mohala o mong.
Thinking people did.	Batho ba nahanang ba ile ba etsa joalo.
All you have to do is say yes.	Seo u lokelang ho se etsa ke ho re e.
We knew it then.	Re ne re e tseba ka nako eo.
And often it is.	'Me hangata ho joalo.
It happens to me too.	Hoa etsahala le ho 'na.
I'm not so sure about that.	Ha ke na bonnete hakaalo ka seo.
We stayed in one place.	Re ile ra lula sebakeng se le seng.
Because tomorrow it will not be.	Hobane hosane e ke ke ea ba teng.
That remains to be seen.	Seo se sa ntse se tla bonahala.
You like to drive and look good when you do it.	U rata ho khanna le ho shebahala hantle ha u e etsa.
He refused one.	O ile a hana e le 'ngoe.
Make no mistake, baby.	U se ke ua etsa phoso, ngoana.
Yet they stayed together.	Leha ho le joalo ba ile ba lula hammoho.
I could think.	Ke ne ke khona ho nahana.
Of course we did.	Ehlile re entse joalo.
This was news to me.	Tsena e ne e le litaba ho 'na.
The food went well.	Lijo li ile tsa tsamaea hantle.
They are very nice, and you were very simple.	Li ntle haholo, 'me u ne u le bonolo haholo.
Then you know what you want to do.	Ebe u tseba seo u batlang ho se etsa.
It was very difficult to watch it.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo ho e shebella.
There is no request to see anything.	Ha ho kopo ea ho bona eng kapa eng.
You have to think you can stop it.	U tlameha ho nahana hore u ka e tlohela.
But without it you cannot be all.	Empa ntle le eona u ke ke ua ba kaofela.
It no longer hurts.	Ha e sa le bohloko.
It works so well.	Ho sebetsa hantle joalo.
I would not like to comment on it.	Ha ke na ho rata ho fana ka maikutlo a letho ka eona.
It seemed like a huge undertaking.	Ho ne ho bonahala e le mosebetsi o moholo.
I often hear her sing.	Hangata ke mo utloa a bina.
It works well.	O sebetsa hantle.
That's what they are.	Ke seo ba leng sona.
There were no people anywhere.	Ho ne ho se na batho kae kapa kae.
I just need someone here for me.	Ke mpa ke hloka motho mona bakeng sa ka.
We need to think carefully and plan what we are going to do.	Re hloka ho nahana hantle le ho rera seo re tlang ho se etsa.
The truth is, they are both.	'Nete ke hore, ke bobeli.
I've heard a lot about you.	Ke utloile tse ngata ka uena.
We are going home now.	Re ea hae joale.
I want to know.	Ke batla ho tseba.
His first job required him to leave.	Mosebetsi oa hae oa pele o ne o hloka hore a tsamaee.
Very heavy food.	Lijo tse boima haholo.
So it seems.	Kahoo ho bonahala.
I can even think straight.	Ke khona le ho nahana hantle.
We talked for hours and hours.	Re ne re qeta lihora le lihora re bua.
I've seen it work.	Ke e bone e sebetsa.
I can't think of one bad thing.	Ha ke khone ho nahana ka ntho e le 'ngoe e mpe.
They need to think again.	Ba lokela ho nahana hape.
But they have it back.	Empa ba na le eona morao.
You never knew him.	Ha ho mohla u kileng ua mo tseba.
I was really tired at first.	Ka sebele ke ne ke khathetse pele.
And it really works.	'Me e hlile ea sebetsa.
It was delicious.	E ne e le monate haholo.
We wouldn’t need him, though.	Re ka be re sa mo hloke, leha ho le joalo.
I'm home now.	Ke hae jwale.
It seemed to help.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho thusa.
If you are sure.	Haeba o na le bonnete.
As it was, it did not happen.	Joalo ka ha ho ne ho le joalo, ha hoa etsahala.
There are many of them.	Ho na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
Each team plays each team in its own team once.	Sehlopha se seng le se seng se bapala sehlopha se seng le se seng sehlopheng sa sona hang.
Or is there another easy way.	Kapa na ho na le tsela e 'ngoe e bonolo.
It happened every few years.	E ne e etsahala lilemo tse ling le tse ling tse 'maloa.
I don't see what you could have done.	Ha ke bone hore na o ka be o entse eng hape.
This is what is going to happen.	Sena ke se tlang ho etsahala.
But really.	Empa ha e le hantle.
It is not a matter of money.	Ha se taba ea chelete.
Something happened.	Ho na le ho hong ho etsahetseng.
However, I have to be honest.	Leha ho le joalo, ke tlameha ho bua 'nete.
I will think about it.	Ke tla nahana ka eona.
Of course you will read very well.	Ehlile o tla bala hantle haholo.
Also, probably no one.	Hape, mohlomong ha ho motho.
But he knew that he would not do it.	Empa o ne a tseba hore a ke ke a etsa joalo.
I find that a bit painful.	Ke fumana seo e le ntho e bohloko.
You have to buy legs.	U lokela ho reka maoto.
Because we need it.	Hobane rea e hloka.
You may not like it.	E ka 'na eaba ha u e rate.
We all had to tell him what had happened.	Kaofela re ile ra tlameha ho mo bolella se etsahetseng.
But it would be.	Empa ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
Here he tells us how he did it.	Mona o re bolella kamoo a ileng a e etsa kateng.
It also did not work.	Le eona ha ea ka ea sebetsa.
Sometimes things get really complicated.	Ka linako tse ling lintho tse thata haholo.
It works for me.	E ea sebetsa ho 'na.
However, here it is.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ena.
I never thought so.	Ha ke so nahane joalo.
No, he did not use my name.	Che, ha aa ka a sebelisa lebitso la ka.
Return to your starting point.	Khutlela sebakeng sa hau sa ho qala.
He tried to reach them with his mind.	O ile a leka ho ba fihlela ka kelello ea hae.
He was talking to people.	O ne a bua le batho.
It does not seem so.	Ha ho bonahale joalo.
He thought he understood everything.	O ne a nahana hore o utloisisa ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
I am an expert.	Ke setsebi.
And he didn't realize.	Mme ha a ka a hlokomela.
Then there is the matter of weight.	Joale ho na le taba ea boima.
All, but one such.	Tsohle, empa e le 'ngoe e joalo.
The children decided that they needed to do something to help.	Bana ba ile ba etsa qeto ea hore ba lokela ho etsa ho hong ho thusa.
They have never been like that.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba joalo.
But without it, he was useless.	Empa ntle le eona, o ne a se na thuso.
I want to learn it.	Ke batla ho e ithuta.
They will not go anywhere.	Ba ke ke ba ea kae kapa kae.
It's not as dangerous as mine.	Ha ho e kotsi joalo ka ea ka.
We have a lot of books at home.	Re na le libuka tse ngata hae.
The party lasted all night.	Mokete o ile oa nka bosiu bohle.
Maybe I don't understand it.	Mohlomong ha ke e utloisise.
We all wanted to go.	Kaofela re ne re batla ho tsamaea.
Not so at this time.	Ha ho joalo ka nako ena.
He was busy with family matters.	O ne a phathahane ka ho lokisa litaba tsa lelapa.
It is better not to think now.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua nahana hona joale.
I will never come home to you again.	Nke ke ka hlola ke tla hae ho wena hape.
I still see that a lot.	Ke ntse ke bona seo haholo.
This is important.	Sena se bohlokoa.
There was a time when he would say what he thought.	Ho na le nako eo a neng a tla bua seo a se nahanang.
Both work well.	Ka bobeli li sebetsa hantle.
The same is true of other people.	Ho bile joalo le ka batho ba bang.
So, you can try again, if you wish.	Kahoo, u ka leka hape, haeba u lakatsa.
And often this works well enough.	'Me hangata sena se sebetsa hantle ka ho lekaneng.
Thank you for giving so much.	Kea le leboha ka ho fana hakana.
People need to know it.	Batho ba lokela ho e tseba.
I don't care to talk to him sometimes.	Ha ke tsotelle ho bua le eena ka linako tse ling.
But this time he would not feel that way.	Empa nakong ena o ne a ke ke a ikutloa joalo.
Do you really need it? 	Na u hlile ua e hloka?
he asked.	a botsa.
Everyone must have that opportunity.	E mong le e mong o tlameha ho ba le monyetla oo.
I find that he did.	Ke fumana hore o entse joalo.
Do we need to visit a doctor?	Na re hloka ho etela ngaka?
This is not a good thing, this should not happen.	Sena ha se ntho e ntle, sena ha sea lokela ho etsahala.
I said no.	Ke ile ka re che.
But they did not want to think about it.	Empa ba ne ba sa rate ho nahana ka seo.
I don't want to make a family law.	Ha ke batle ho etsa molao oa lelapa.
Because you made a mistake.	Hobane u entse phoso.
They have several children.	Ba na le bana ba ’maloa.
He is not in it.	Ha a eo ho eona.
I could see them doing it.	Ke ne ke bona ba e etsa.
Then I came to my senses.	Eaba ho khutla kelello.
He says he does.	O re oa etsa joalo.
It was a wonderful day.	E ne e le letsatsi le monate.
So, finally.	Kahoo, qetellong.
The mother cared for her children.	’Mè o ne a hlokomela bana ba hae.
Join a teacher nearby.	Kena le tichere e haufi.
Or that there is none.	Kapa hore ha ho na.
Well, it doesn't matter now.	Be, ha ho na taba jwale.
To be friends.	Hore re be metsoalle.
Take the family.	Nka lelapa.
She was shy.	O ne a le lihlong.
They will probably find that they are not able to do it.	Mohlomong ba tla fumana hore ha ba khone ho e etsa.
First thing tomorrow.	Ntho ea pele hosane.
To love, to love, to love.	Ho rata, ho rata, ho rata.
Man and woman are all one.	Monna le mosali ke bona bohle.
And sometimes it works.	'Me ka linako tse ling e sebetsa.
This makes it very difficult to give up.	Sena se etsa hore ho be thata haholo ho e tlohela.
They should not spend money too often.	Ha baa lokela ho sebelisa chelete hangata.
This was not a time or place.	Ena e ne e se nako kapa sebaka.
I don't need a house like this.	Ha ke hloke ntlo e kang ena.
He needed to know more.	O ne a lokela ho tseba ho feta.
Yes, it probably was.	E, mohlomong ho ne ho le joalo.
He is still human.	E ntse e le motho.
You can't save any.	U ke ke ua boloka leha e le efe.
He was at home.	O ne a le hae.
I had to try.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho leka.
That's where he is.	Ke eo moo a leng teng.
It could be something else.	E ka ba ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Talk to your doctor.	Bua le ngaka ea hau.
I'm a doctor, that's fine.	Ke ngaka, e molemo.
Time was always there when we tried.	Nako e ne e le teng nako le nako ha re leka.
I will have to go with e.	Ke tla tlameha ho tsamaea le e.
She looked so pretty that night.	O ne a shebahala a le motle haholo bosiung boo.
I was so close!	Ke ne ke le haufi haholo!
The process is simple.	Mokhoa ona o bonolo.
Most sensible people would do that.	Batho ba bangata ba nang le kelello ba ne ba tla etsa joalo.
It took too long.	E ne e nka nako e telele haholo.
I will never forget him.	Ke ne nke ke ka mo lebala.
But sometimes even the strong ones need help.	Empa ka linako tse ling le batho ba matla ba hloka thuso.
I don't see why.	Ha ke bone lebaka.
Only one specialist was a teacher.	Setsebi se le seng feela e ne e le tichere.
That is a long time ago.	Ke nako e telele e fetileng.
He continued to sing.	A tsoela pele ho bina.
Our room was really like that.	Kamore ea rona e ne e hlile e le joalo.
Every second day, or so.	Letsatsi le leng le le leng la bobeli, kapa joalo.
It was another bad school week.	E ne e le beke e 'ngoe e mpe ea sekolo.
He just knew he had to try.	O ne a tseba feela hore o tlameha ho leka.
It works well.	E sebetsa hantle.
I have no need to doubt that.	Ha ke hloke ho belaela hoo.
Look at that.	Sheba seo.
It was wonderful to be with family and friends.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba le ba lelapa le metsoalle.
Nako.	Nako.
So off he goes.	Kahoo oa tsamaea.
That, as we have seen, is not so here.	Seo, joalo ka ha re se re bone, ha se joalo mona.
Then he tried to sleep again.	Eaba o leka ho robala hape.
I fell asleep while working.	Ke ile ka robala ke ntse ke sebetsa.
Its very.	Eona haholo.
I see it as home.	Ke e bona e le hae.
Ask, do not say.	Botsa, o seke oa bolela.
It took a long, long time.	Ho nkile nako e telele, e telele.
You must have done it on time.	E tlameha ebe u e entse ka nako.
He had not thought about that for a long time.	E ne e se e le nako e telele a sa nahane ka potso eo.
It will not take days.	E ke ke ea nka matsatsi.
I'm still as busy as ever.	Ke ntse ke phathahane joaloka pele.
But there is a place.	Empa sebaka se teng.
People need to eat.	Batho ba hloka ho ja.
That has never been a question.	Seo ha se eso be potso.
He was a great man.	E ne e le monna e moholo.
They are all very good, not to mention very nice.	Kaofela li ntle haholo, re sa bue ka tse ntle haholo.
He stays closer than ever.	A dula a le haufi le ho feta kamehla.
They need you for their lives.	Ba u hloka bakeng sa bophelo ba bona.
Of course, this is nothing new.	Ha e le hantle, sena hase ntho e ncha.
He walked a little ahead of me.	O ile a tsamaea pele ho 'na hanyane.
It can be a lot at times.	E ka ba ngata ka linako tse ling.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
After studying, he will return home.	Ka mor’a ho ithuta, o tla khutlela hae.
We just sat there doing nothing.	Re ile ra lula re sa etse letho.
They had no shoes.	Ba ne ba sena le lieta.
He drank coffee.	O ile a noa kofi.
He was always like that.	O ne a lula joalo hangata.
It was exactly what he wanted to be.	E ne e le hantle seo a neng a batla ho ba sona.
So let's do it.	Kahoo a re e etse.
They do what they do and we do what we do.	Ba etsa seo ba se etsang mme le rona re etsa seo re se etsang.
I wanted to forget it, but it stayed with me.	Ke ne ke batla ho e lebala, empa e ile ea lula le ’na.
He knows why he is there.	Oa tseba hore na ke hobane'ng ha a le moo.
We are moving forward.	Re ntse re tsoela pele.
Absolutely not possible.	Ho hang e ke ke ea etsahala.
What made you think of that?	Ke eng e entseng hore u nahane ka seo?
And they stayed that way all the time.	Mme ba ile ba dula ba le jwalo ka nako tsohle.
I'm in pain.	Ke utloa bohloko.
We will catch them soon.	Re tla ba tšoara haufinyane.
This was the most dangerous situation.	Ena e ne e le boemo bo kotsi ka ho fetisisa.
It's easy for you.	Ho bonolo ho uena.
It can't reach him.	Ha e khone ho mo fihlela.
We look forward to coming back in the future.	Re lebeletse ho tla hape nakong e tlang.
Some did not return home.	Ba bang ha baa ka ba khutlela hae.
He told me he was going home.	O ile a mpolella hore o ea hae.
That was a good reason, if you wanted a reason.	Eo e ne e le lebaka le lekaneng, haeba u ne u batla lebaka.
He did not finish eating.	Ha a ka a qeta ho ja.
Yet this is what we did.	Leha ho le joalo sena ke seo re se entseng.
I could not do it without him.	Ke ne nke ke ka ho etsa ntle le eena.
I knew nothing about writing.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe letho ka ho ngola.
They do not last long.	Ha ba lule nako e telele.
I just think it’s weird.	Ke nahana feela hore ke ntho e makatsang.
Try reading this.	Leka ho bala sena.
They love bad and strange things too.	Ba rata lintho tse mpe le tse makatsang le bona.
This was something new to me.	Ena e ne e le ntho e ncha ho 'na.
You should call immediately.	O lokela ho letsa hang hang.
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le joalo.
He thought he was too hard.	O ne a nahana hore o thata haholo.
You have to come here.	U tlameha ho tla mona.
Well, it doesn't matter now.	Be, ha ho na taba jwale.
Saying 'thank you', maybe.	Ho re 'kea leboha', mohlomong.
I did not like him.	Ke ne ke sa mo rate.
Apply first then.	Kopa pele ka mor'a moo.
We used to have it.	Re kile ra ba le eona.
This is a picture of it.	Sena ke setšoantšo sa eona.
That will not be the case.	Ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
To many others.	Ho ba bang ba bangata.
Do you have enough food today?	A na u na le lijo tse lekaneng kajeno?
I think the police were trying to get into her husband.	Ke nahana hore mapolesa a ne a leka ho kena ho monna oa hae.
He does not know what he wants to do.	Ha a tsebe seo a batlang ho se etsa.
This was the only work he could do.	Ona e ne e le mosebetsi oo a neng a ka o etsa feela.
But wrong in what way ?.	Empa phoso ka tsela efe?.
So what will you eat for breakfast?	Joale u tla ja eng bakeng sa lijo tsa hoseng?
He saw.	O ile a bona.
It was now.	E ne e le jwale.
Find out if they need anything for their job.	Fumana hore na ba hloka eng kapa eng bakeng sa mosebetsi oa bona.
Well, here it is.	Be, ke eona ena.
That was the case this week.	Ho bile joalo bekeng ena.
It's still too much.	E ntse e le ngata haholo.
Even if you don't need them now.	Le ha o sa li hloke hona joale.
We had to let him go.	Re ne re lokela ho mo tlohela.
These are some of the things.	Tsena ke lintho tse ling.
They like the book or they don't like it.	Ba rata buka kapa ha ba e rate.
You can help her write her first book here.	U ka mo thusa ho ngola buka ea hae ea pele mona.
He had a certain weapon.	O ne a e-na le sebetsa se itseng.
I'm sorry I took too long.	Ke masoabi hore ebe ke nkile nako e telele.
We were unable to process your request.	Ha rea ​​khona ho sebetsa kopo ea hau.
That will do us good.	Seo se tla re etsetsa sona.
That was important.	Seo se ne se le bohlokoa.
Have fun.	Eba le monate.
Anything I liked at the time.	Eng kapa eng eo ke e ratang ka nako eo.
I could not do without it.	Ke ne nke ke ka khona ntle le eona.
He went further.	O ile a tsoela pele ho feta moo.
It will probably be my last.	Mohlomong e tla ba la ka la ho qetela.
I want it.	Kea e batla.
I am writing.	Kea ngola.
I think she is crying.	Ke nahana hore oa lla.
Anything that the mind can think of is mental.	Eng kapa eng eo kelello e ka nahanang ka eona ke ea kelello.
I was here today, everything looks good.	Ke bile teng kajeno, tsohle li shebahala hantle.
She looked at the baby.	A sheba ngoana.
He was the only person present.	E ne e le eena feela motho ea teng.
I loved her.	Ke ne ke mo rata.
Give all your work.	Fana ka mosebetsi oa hau kaofela.
Someone needs you, and we try to help.	Ho na le motho ea u hlokang, 'me re leka ho mo thusa.
Well, be careful.	Be, hlokomela.
He is more powerful, more powerful than any of us.	O matla haholo, o matla ho feta mang kapa mang wa rona.
Now was not the time.	Joale e ne e se nako.
Notice here.	Hlokomela mona.
You didn’t know how we were.	U ne u sa tsebe hore na re joang.
But you can't have both, man.	Empa u ke ke ua ba le bobeli, monna.
But also he would not let her go prematurely.	Empa hape o ne a ke ke a mo tlohela hore a tsamaee pele ho nako.
I want to learn more about it.	Ke batla ho ithuta haholoanyane ka eona.
He wanted to try again.	O ne a batla ho leka hape.
Here he thought the woman was coming to him.	Mona o ne a nahana hore mosali o ntse a tla ho eena.
Today, however, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, kajeno sena ha se 'nete.
Probably more than anyone.	Mohlomong ho feta mang kapa mang.
Of course he could not get it from where he was.	Ehlile o ne a sa khone ho e fumana ho tloha moo a neng a le teng.
And you were not.	Mme o ne o se jwalo.
You would have to ask him.	U ne u tla tlameha ho mo botsa.
It could happen, a little bit.	Ho ka etsahala, hanyane.
He was alive, but only.	O ne a phela, empa feela.
He saw it happen.	O e bone e etsahala.
More than once.	Ho feta hang.
You are not one of us.	Ha u e mong oa rona.
Love, he is your husband.	Rata, ke monna wa hao.
Because it would make everyone think.	Hobane e ne e tla etsa hore bohle ba nahane.
Find a house, then, do what you want.	Batla ntlo, joale, etsa seo u se batlang.
He never knew what to do with them.	Le ka mohla o ne a sa tsebe seo a ka se etsang ka bona.
I could have done more.	Nka be ke entse ho feta.
Too much.	Le ngata haholo.
But once we get out of work, we may not stay here.	Empa hang ha re tsoa mosebetsing, re ka ’na ra se ke ra lula mona.
They had their chance.	Ba bile le monyetla oa bona.
He knew no.	O ne a itse che.
He wondered what he was thinking.	A ipotsa hore na ebe o ntse a nahana ka eng.
He hoped it wasn't him.	O ne a tšepa hore e ne e se eena.
They will ask you why you are looking for a job.	Ba tla u botsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha u batla mosebetsi.
He has been coming here for years.	E se e le lilemo a tla mona.
It hurts a lot.	E bohloko haholo.
I once read something about coffee.	Ke kile ka bala ho hong ka kofi.
I'm not sure what happened.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahetse'ng.
Now we do not.	Hona joale ha re etse joalo.
He wants you to find out everything about it.	O batla hore u fumane ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ka taba eo.
Or just rely on a delicious breakfast.	Kapa feela tšepa lijo tsa hoseng tse monate.
He did it.	O e entse.
No one could have imagined it.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka nahana.
Sorry, to do this but.	Ke masoabi, ho etsa sena empa.
It was more difficult work.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima ho feta.
None of us needed to say it.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa rona ea neng a hloka ho e bua.
Maybe it meant something.	Mohlomong e ne e bolela ho hong.
It will not take long.	E ke ke ea nka nako e telele.
I think all my life without them.	Ke nahana bophelo bohle ntle le bona.
Do not ask questions.	U se ke ua botsa lipotso.
And it would not meet in a better time, either.	Mme e ne e ka se kopane ka nako e betere, le hona.
But it tells Dad everything.	Empa e bolella Ntate tsohle.
We are moving on with our lives.	Re ntse re tsoela pele ka bophelo ba rona.
I work here.	Ke sebetsa mona.
So now we know.	Kahoo joale rea tseba.
Last question.	Potso ea ho qetela.
Understanding why it works and how it works.	Ho utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha e sebetsa le hore na e sebetsa joang.
Then he can do whatever he wants.	Joale a ka etsa seo a se batlang.
He used to go to night school.	O ne a tloaetse ho ea sekolong sa bosiu.
I doubt you can do that.	Ke belaela hore u ka etsa joalo.
That would have to come from me.	Seo se ne se tla tlameha ho tsoa ho 'na.
It was not fun at all.	Ho ne ho se monate ho hang.
But it is coming.	Empa e a tla.
He knew what was coming.	O ne a tseba se tlang ho tla.
I feel very happy here.	Ke ikutloa ke thabile haholo mona.
I do not need a head doctor.	Ha ke hloke ngaka ea hlooho.
I was not sleeping.	Ke ne ke sa robala.
It goes fast.	E tsamaea kapele.
Just, notice, this.	Feela, hlokomela, sena.
We can help provide that.	Re ka thusa ho fana ka seo.
He could have been there.	A ka be a bile teng.
He returned very soon.	O ile a khutla kapele haholo.
It is easy for him to speak.	Ho bonolo hore a bue.
I say it did.	Ke re e entse joalo.
Otherwise it always works.	Ho seng joalo e lula e sebetsa.
He had never felt this way before to anyone.	Ho ne ho se mohla a kileng a ikutloa ka tsela ena ho mang kapa mang.
Some people wanted to keep spending money.	Batho ba bang ba ne ba batla ho tsoela pele ho sebelisa chelete.
But danger is danger.	Empa kotsi ke kotsi.
And there it is.	Mme ke eo.
However, I passed.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ile ka feta.
I heard him once.	Ke ile ka mo utloa hang.
I have it too now.	Le 'na ke na le eona hona joale.
Look, people suffered last night.	Sheba, batho ba utloile bohloko bosiung bo fetileng.
The police arrived.	Mapolesa a ile a fihla.
We try to do our best.	Re leka ho etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
They both learn by watching.	Ka bobeli ba ithuta ka ho shebella.
He had his own ideas.	O ne a e-na le maikutlo a hae.
It is very dangerous.	Ho kotsi haholo.
You must have heard something.	E tlameha ebe o utloile ho hong.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
And it will not be easy.	'Me ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
I don’t want or need anything more than that.	Ha ke batle kapa ha ke hloke letho ho feta moo.
Again, together.	Hape, hammoho.
Like them.	Joalo ka bona.
He was very happy.	O ne a thabile haholo.
And you do not know him as we know him.	Hape ha u mo tsebe ka tsela eo re mo tsebang ka eona.
It was his.	E ne e le ea hae.
It was very powerful.	E ne e le matla haholo.
Really, well.	Ka 'nete, hantle.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
To my friends.	Ho metsoalle ea ka.
It has a lot of stuff.	E na le lintho tse ngata.
I just read fast.	Ke bala kapele feela.
They started drinking heavily.	Ba ile ba qala ho noa haholo.
See also.	Sheba le.
I'll take a look.	Ke tla sheba.
Many were weeping.	Ba bangata ba ne ba lla.
Thanks for being with us tonight.	Re leboha ho ba le rona bosiung bona.
He told me not to do anything.	O ile a mpolella hore ke se ke ka etsa letho.
I hope they will.	Ke tšepa ba tla etsa joalo.
He slept with his wife.	O ile a robala le mosali oa hae.
We wonder about the past.	Re ipotsa ka tse fetileng.
It worked for me.	E ile ea sebetsa ho 'na.
This can go either way.	Sena se ka ea ka tsela efe kapa efe.
I did not see anyone.	Ha kea ka ka bona motho.
There is no one way to get there.	Ha ho na tsela e le 'ngoe ea ho fihla moo.
If he left, there would be others.	Haeba a ne a ka tsamaea, ho ne ho tla ba le ba bang.
But to me it seems you are doing well so far.	Empa ho 'na ho bonahala eka u ntse u sebetsa hantle ho fihlela joale.
Sometimes my father was not there.	Ka nako e ’ngoe Ntate o ne a le sieo.
He has a very good idea.	O na le mohopolo o motle haholo.
Now it is his life.	Hona joale ke bophelo ba hae.
However, there was nothing.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se letho.
Soon they will arrive.	Haufinyane ba tla fihla.
She loves fresh coffee, her husband loves it.	O rata kofi e ncha, monna oa hae oa e rata.
In fact, we asked everyone.	Ha e le hantle, re ile ra botsa motho e mong le e mong.
We can fix it legally or legally and we need to fix it.	Re ka e lokisa ka molao kapa ka molao mme re lokela ho e lokisa.
In fact, he suffered even more.	Ha e le hantle, o ile a utloa bohloko le ho feta.
Moreover, it should be good.	Ho feta moo, e lokela ho ba hantle.
What? 	Eng?
I hope you will too.	Ke tšepa hore le uena u tla etsa joalo.
The idea is simple.	Mohopolo o bonolo.
We thought it was not our problem.	Re ne re nahana hore hase bothata ba rōna.
Asking and telling, however, is very much needed.	Ho botsa le ho bolela, leha ho le joalo, ho hlokahala haholo.
Are you done, if so you can go.	Na u qetile, haeba ho joalo u ka tsamaea.
The place feels.	Sebaka se ikutloa.
He really did not know how long.	O ne a hlile a sa tsebe hore na ho fihlela neng.
Who said all.	Ea buileng tsohle.
This is very important to me.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo ho nna.
Even after this for many years.	Le ka mor'a sena lilemo tse ngata.
We know it.	Rea e tseba.
I picked up the phone.	Ke nkile mohala.
I'm waiting for you.	Ke u emetse.
Most people are.	Batho ba bangata ba.
It is amazingly beautiful.	E ntle ka tsela e makatsang.
And it continues to play.	'Me e tsoela pele ho bapala.
Whatever you want.	Eng kapa eng eo o e batlang.
Yes, that's right, my parents.	E, ho joalo, batsoali ba ka.
This is not our problem.	Sena ha se bothata ba rona.
No, he will not come in again.	Che, a ke ke a kena hape.
I understand that.	Ke utloisisa seo.
However, your application usually does not need to call this system.	Leha ho le joalo, kopo ea hau hangata ha e hloke ho letsetsa mokhoa ona.
It was so easy to get away from him.	Ho ne ho bile bonolo haholo ho tloha ho eena.
Whatever he did, it quickly consumed him.	Eng kapa eng eo e e entseng, e ne e mo qetile kapele.
The real problem is getting people to see it.	Bothata ba sebele ke ho etsa hore batho ba e bone.
Maybe some here feel that way now.	Mohlomong ba bang mona ba ikutloa ka tsela eo hona joale.
I had time, but maybe not too much.	Ke ne ke e-na le nako, empa mohlomong e se e ngata haholo.
I don't see it either.	Le nna ha ke e bone.
It still exists.	E ntse e le teng.
Water is life.	Metsi ke bophelo.
None of them said anything.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ileng a bua letho.
She usually eats dinner.	Hangata o ja lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I really don't think they will.	Ruri ha ke nahane hore ba tla etsa joalo.
It went with him.	E ile ea tsamaea le eena.
The house comes with everything you will need while you are there.	Ntlo e tla le ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe eo u tla e hloka ha u le moo.
We will not give you everything you want.	Re ke ke ra u fa sohle seo u se batlang.
I did not get anywhere.	Ha kea fihla kae kapa kae.
I would love it more.	Nka e rata ho feta.
It has to be.	E lokela ho ba eona.
So he finally fell asleep.	Kahoo qetellong a robala.
That's right, for all that.	Ke hantle, bakeng sa tseo tsohle.
He will not find anything in it.	A ke ke a fumana letho ho eona.
This can be anything you want.	Sena e ka ba eng kapa eng eo u e batlang.
I have to go talk to my mother.	Ke tlameha ho ea bua le mme oa ka.
Do not drive, instead, ride a bicycle.	U se ke ua khanna koloi, ho e-na le hoo, palama baesekele.
All children must do it.	Bana bohle ba tlameha ho e etsa.
But it is even easier to read by a teacher.	Empa ho bonolo le ho feta ho bala ke tichere.
He's been here a lot.	O bile mona haholo.
You think they could have thought of something better than that.	U nahana hore ba ka be ba ile ba nahana ka ho hong ho molemo ho feta moo.
None of that was important at the time.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tseo e neng e le ea bohlokoa ka nako eo.
His hands fell off.	Matsoho a hae a oa.
When he arrived, he looked very tired.	A fihla a bonahala a khathetse haholo.
But everyone wanted to do that.	Empa bohle ba ne ba batla ho etsa taba eo.
The important thing here is the people.	Taba ea bohlokoa mona ke batho.
It's water.	Ke metsi.
Maybe even more.	Mohlomong le ho feta.
Eating and drinking is painful.	Ho ja le ho noa ho bohloko.
We should not have them.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho ba le tsona.
But you have to be alone.	Empa o tlameha ho ba mong.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
Sometimes, life passes quickly.	Ka linako tse ling, bophelo bo feta kapele.
This helps us to learn.	Sena se re thusa ho ithuta.
Life is work.	Bophelo ke mosebetsi.
Yes, there are others.	E, ho na le ba bang.
Of course I will stay there again.	Ehlile ke tla lula moo hape.
You have to look.	U tlameha ho sheba.
He said he just wanted to talk.	O ile a re o batla ho bua feela.
But for him.	Empa bakeng sa hae.
He had to keep going.	O ile a tlameha ho tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
I talk to her doctor every day.	Ke bua le ngaka ea hae letsatsi le leng le le leng.
I hope you understand.	Kea tšepa u utloisisa.
We had life.	Re ne re e-na le bophelo.
I have a lot of them.	Ke na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
But once with me.	Empa hang le nna.
He knew his wife well.	O ne a tseba mosali oa hae hantle.
Meet us.	Kopana le rona.
Maybe one day.	Mohlomong ka letsatsi le leng.
Who I am.	Ke mang.
They do not want your suggestion.	Ha ba batle tlhahiso ea hau.
Why do you walk when you can ride?	Ke hobane'ng ha u tsamaea ha u khona ho palama?
He’s a tough guy and he’ll be back.	Ke mohlankana ea thata 'me o tla khutla.
But it is, and it works very well.	Empa ho joalo, 'me e sebetsa hantle haholo.
I did not like any book.	Ke ne ke sa rate buka leha e le efe.
We will be talking.	Re tla be re bua.
He had a job, a wife and a child.	O ne a e-na le mosebetsi, mosali le ngoana.
After a day of hard work, he felt exhausted.	Ka mor’a letsatsi la ho sebetsa ka thata, o ile a ikutloa a khathetse.
If you are happy where you are, it is better for you.	Haeba u thabile moo u leng teng, ho molemo ho uena.
You know, when he was.	Le a tseba, ha a ne a.
I am not important.	Ha se 'na oa bohlokoa.
What were you doing?	U ne u etsa'ng?
She returned to her room crying.	O ile a khutla sebakeng sa hae a lla.
But it was hard to say.	Empa ho ne ho le thata ho bolela.
Morning and early bedtime.	Hoseng le ho robala pele ho nako.
We have to get out of this.	Re tlameha ho tsoa ho sena.
Life was good but easy.	Bophelo bo ne bo le monate empa bo le bonolo.
We must keep him talking.	Re tlameha ho mo boloka a ntse a bua.
It will not happen.	Ha e tlo etsahala.
This was important to him.	Sena se ne se le bohlokoa ho eena.
He never asked what it was.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a botsa hore na ke eng.
There is nothing there, either.	Ha ho letho moo, le hona.
I could not eat anything.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ja letho.
This is amazingly good news.	Tsena ke litaba tse monate ka tsela e makatsang.
Why he did that.	Hobaneng a ile a etsa joalo.
Night falls.	Bosiu bo kena.
He would have to think fast.	O ne a tla lokela ho nahana kapele.
You can do something like this.	U ka etsa ntho e kang ena.
Exactly so.	Hantle joalo.
Our children go to school together.	Bana ba rona ba kena sekolo hammoho.
Why not do it now.	Hobaneng o sa etse joalo hona joale.
It makes him think.	Ho etsa hore a nahane.
Of course, this is my surprise.	Ehlile, ena ke ntho e makatsang ea ka.
I started drinking a lot.	Ke ile ka qala ho noa haholo.
I do not like him.	Ha ke mo rate.
I had spent time with so many.	Ke ne ke qetile nako le ba bangata haholo.
He never denied it.	Ha A ka a e hana.
They can't find their way.	Ha ba khone ho fumana tsela ea bona.
I wish there were some of them.	Ke lakatsa eka ho ka be ho e-na le tse ling tsa tsona.
It wants to be a problem.	E batla ho ba bothata.
That is where their power came from.	Ke hona moo matla a bona a neng a tsoa teng.
He enjoyed talking with her.	O ne a thabela ho bua le eena.
I'm not the only one who knows about this place.	Ha se 'na feela ea tsebang ka sebaka sena.
Of course, this is easier said than done.	Ha e le hantle, sena se bonolo ho bua ho feta ho se etsa.
He would live his life now.	O ne a tla phela bophelo ba hae joale.
He took the dog.	A nka ntja.
Or, if they did, they did not say so.	Kapa, ​​haeba ba entse joalo, ha ba ka ba bua joalo.
Get into it.	Kena ho eona.
She lives with her husband and son.	O lula le monna oa hae le mora oa hae.
And making food is not just food.	'Me ho etsa lijo hase feela lijo.
We even went swimming.	Re bile ra ea sesa.
And she didn't want to be that way.	Mme o ne a sa batle ho ba jwalo.
He did not see a way out.	Ha aa ka a bona tsela ea ho tsoa ho eona.
I am a psychologist.	Ke setsebi sa kelello.
After all, it's up to you.	Ka mor'a moo, ho ho uena.
It was hard to take that.	Ho ne ho le thata ho nka seo.
It's kind of weird.	Ke mofuta o makatsang.
Do you have any questions?	O na le lipotso?
I guess his decision was already here.	Ke nka qeto ea hae e ne e se e le mona.
he thought.	a nahana.
I felt tired.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke khathetse.
Tell us where you are.	Re bolelle moo o leng teng.
A woman may not pay them because she did not pay them.	Mosali a ka ’na a se ke a ba lefa hobane a sa ka a ba lefa.
Your father did not think so much of it.	Ntate oa hao ha aa ka a nahana hakaalo ka hona.
Maybe you even give it away.	Mohlomong u bile u fana ka eona.
He drove all night.	O ne a khanna bosiu bohle.
Then where and when.	Joale le kae le.
That would be a good thing.	E ka bang ntho e ntle.
None of us were easy.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a le bonolo.
However, this is not the case here.	Leha ho le joalo, mona ha ho joalo.
However, we will see.	Leha ho le joalo, re tla bona.
We never thought it would reach him.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra nahana hore e ke ke ea mo fihlela.
He made a mistake.	O entse phoso.
It gives you a chance to think a little bit.	E u fa monyetla oa ho nahana hanyane.
Some of them can get it.	Ba bang ba bona ba ka e fumana.
Of course, he did not have much to say.	Ke ’nete hore o ne a se na lintho tse ngata tseo a ka li buang.
It hasn't been fast.	Ha e eso be kapele.
Now, look at their hair.	Jwale, sheba moriri wa bona.
That is despite the fact that you did not look so good.	Ho joalo le hoja u ne u sa shebahala hantle hakaalo.
It was easy not to be around him.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho se be haufi le eena.
This is what he understood.	Sena ke seo a neng a se utloisisa.
I have to go.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
She was the mother of her child.	E ne e le 'mè oa ngoana oa hae.
I have a good idea.	Ke na le mohopolo o motle.
I don't even know if this will reach you.	Ha ke tsebe le hore na sena se tla o fihlela.
It would have been much easier.	Ho ka be ho bile bonolo haholo.
He took three.	A nka tse tharo.
I have to think things through, decide.	Ke tlameha ho nahana lintho hantle, ho etsa qeto.
I never got a chance to tell him.	Ha kea ka ka fumana monyetla oa ho mo bolella.
They want to help.	Ba batla ho thusa.
So it is because of the way we think.	Kahoo ke lebaka la tsela eo re nahanang ka eona.
It certainly was the same for me.	Ka sebele ho ne ho le joalo ka ’na.
Each time, he tried to say something.	Nako le nako o ne a leka ho bua ho hong.
We will have to think about it.	Re tla tlameha ho nahana ka eona.
It was good, he thought.	Ho ne ho le molemo, a nahana.
Well outside our legs and head.	Hantle ntle maoto le hlooho ea rōna.
He wanted me to tell you.	O ne a batla hore ke o bolelle.
It really is an amazing book.	Ehlile ke buka e makatsang.
It's very simple.	E bonolo haholo.
It's that time again.	Ke nako eo hape.
One was a man.	E mong e ne e le monna.
He continued to walk.	O ile a tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
To be honest, the money was gone.	Ho bua 'nete, chelete e ne e le sieo.
Decide now.	Etsa qeto hona joale.
Look at that child.	Sheba ngoana eo.
It would no longer be necessary.	Ho ne ho se ho sa tla hlokahala.
I never told you.	Ha ke eso o bolelle.
They live hard.	Ba phela ka thata.
This school is beautiful.	Sekolo sena se setle.
Just right.	Hantle feela.
Obviously it has to be.	Ho hlakile hore e tlameha ho ba joalo.
And thank you !!.	Mme kea leboha!!.
She is really beautiful.	O hlile o motle.
Soon she was everyone for her.	Haufinyane e ne e se e le motho e mong le e mong bakeng sa hae.
It was for you.	E bile bakeng sa hau.
I don't even know what that means.	Ha ke tsebe le hore na hoo ho bolela eng.
We're not done.	Ha rea ​​qeta.
Yes, they probably did.	E, mohlomong ba entse joalo.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
We both know you are useless.	Ka bobeli rea tseba hore ha u na thuso.
They loved him.	Ba ne ba mo rata.
I found him.	Ke mo fumane.
Some policemen were not there.	Mapolesa a mang a ne a le sieo.
But no woman applied.	Empa ha ho mosali ea entseng kopo.
The important thing is life.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke bophelo.
They're just here to do the work.	Ba mona feela ho etsa mosebetsi.
She has always known him.	Haesale a mo tseba.
Not so here.	Ha ho joalo mona.
I would like to go home.	Ke kopa ho khutlela hae.
They are like you because they are.	Ba joalo ka uena hobane ho joalo.
Instead of this.	Ho ena le sena.
It is dangerous to drive while intoxicated.	Ho kotsi ho khanna u ntse u noa.
I work tomorrow.	Ke sebetsa hosane.
Of course, we are good friends.	Ke 'nete hore re metsoalle e molemo.
But only if we all agreed.	Empa feela haeba bohle re ile ra lumela.
I use this.	Ke sebelisa sena.
The water feels very hard now.	Metsi a utloa a le thata haholo joale.
He was easy to read.	O ne a le bonolo ho bala.
I looked back until he left.	Ke ile ka sheba morao ho fihlela a tloha.
It was really pretty.	E ne e hlile e ntle haholo.
It was not one of those things.	E ne e se e 'ngoe ea lintho tsena.
It is very easy to find them.	Ho bonolo haholo ho li fumana.
That is often the case.	Hangata ho joalo.
His friends were many.	Metsoalle ea hae e ne e le ngata.
I did not expect that.	Ke ne ke sa lebella seo.
And she was a member of that family.	Mme e ne e le e mong wa lelapa leo.
Probably so as you say.	Mohlomong ho joalo ka ha u bolela.
Or one of them.	Kapa e 'ngoe ea tsona.
I can do maybe.	Nka etsa mohlomong.
There is always more.	Kamehla ho na le ho feta.
If not, then you are not.	Haeba ho se joalo, joale ha u etse joalo.
She seemed happy.	O ne a bonahala a thabile.
But it was not him.	Empa e ne e se eena.
It will be important.	E tla ba ea bohlokoa.
He must have loved that he did not forget.	E tlameha ebe o ne a rata hore ebe ha aa ka a lebala.
Of course, just write down something that is true.	Ehlile, ngola feela ntho eo e leng 'nete.
What to do.	Se o lokelang ho se etsa.
I have nothing.	Ha ke na letho.
That same year, he received his diploma.	Selemong sona seo, o ile a fumana lengolo la hae la molao.
Like the rest of us.	Joalo ka rona ba bang.
I certainly would not have written it.	Ka sebele nka be ke sa e ngola.
Talk to someone.	Bua le motho.
He was talking about someone who says something about anything.	O ne a bua ka motho ya buang ho hong ka eng kapa eng.
But it is moving very fast.	Empa e ntse e tsamaea kapele haholo.
It was nothing at all.	Ho hang e ne e se letho.
I know you can do it.	Kea tseba hore u ka e etsa.
I'll hold.	Ke tla tšoara.
I hear it.	Kea e utloa.
Use your first and last letter.	Sebelisa lengolo la hau la pele le la ho qetela.
He says he needs it for his job.	O re o e hloka bakeng sa mosebetsi oa hae.
I was not sure what was going to happen.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ho tla etsahala eng.
The name of the place means everything.	Lebitso la sebaka seo le bolela tsohle.
It just happened.	E sa tsoa etsahala.
I saw that.	Ke ile ka bona eo.
And they were there.	Mme ba ne ba le teng.
It should work now.	E lokela ho sebetsa hona joale.
The question of being today.	Potso ea ho ba kajeno.
I'm just a boy.	Ke moshanyana feela.
Maybe they can be very important.	Mohlomong li ka ba tsa bohlokoa haholo.
Before you.	Pele uena.
He was just asking.	O ne a botsa feela.
Easy to buy from.	Ho bonolo ho reka ho eona.
He passed me by.	O ile a feta ho nna.
Or maybe I just couldn't.	Kapa mohlomong ha kea khona.
I'm doing something wrong.	Ke etsa ntho e mpe.
Although the space seems empty, it is not.	Leha sebaka se bonahala se se na letho, ha ho joalo.
These people would have been better off without me.	Batho bana ba ka be ba phela betere ntle le nna.
She loves it so much.	O e rata haholo.
So he decided to do it the right way.	Kahoo o ile a etsa qeto ea ho e etsa ka mokhoa.
We tried to find a place to sit down.	Re ile ra leka ho fumana sebaka sa ho lula fatše.
This is indeed good news.	Ka sebele tsena ke litaba tse monate.
I want to be the best.	Ke batla ho ba ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
By their age.	Ka lilemo tsa bona.
All of you.	Kaofela ha lona.
I want them to know that.	Ke batla hore ba tsebe seo.
That would come, he knew.	Seo se ne se tla, o ne a tseba.
Talking to you.	Ho bua le wena.
I needed to know, to see.	Ke ne ke hloka ho tseba, ho bona.
You feel it now.	U ikutloa joale.
Here is another question.	Potso e 'ngoe ke ena.
Neither do I.	Le 'na ha ke joalo.
I see it happening slowly every day.	Ke e bona e etsahala hanyane ka hanyane letsatsi le letsatsi.
He knows the subject very well.	O tseba taba hantle haholo.
We can know many things.	Re ka tseba lintho tse ngata.
Traveling is usually easier.	Ho tsamaea ho bonolo hangata.
Well, you know.	Be, ua tseba.
He looks very bad, right now.	O shebahala a le mpe haholo, hona jwale.
In fact, it is one.	Ha e le hantle, ke e mong.
I would like to know why.	Ke kopa ho tseba hore na hobaneng.
There is really no book like it.	Ruri ha ho buka e tšoanang le eona.
I do not tell anyone.	Ha ke bolelle motho.
In time, you will.	Ha nako e ntse e ea, u tla etsa joalo.
Then they left again.	Eaba baa tsamaea hape.
Then he drank.	Joale o ne a noa.
It was fun.	Ho ne ho le monate.
But it is not a good fact.	Empa ha se 'nete e ntle.
What about you ?.	Joale uena?.
My father said we would not want to, of course.	Ntate o itse re ke ke ra batla, ehlile.
It doesn't have to go that way.	Ha ea tlameha ho tsamaea joalo.
And take care of it.	Le ho e hlokomela.
This is the new one.	Ena ke eona e ncha.
But we need to do something to rectify the situation quickly.	Empa re hloka ho etsa ho hong ho lokisa taba ena kapele.
He will be at work tonight.	O tla fihla mosebetsing bosiung bona.
Here it is.	Ke sena seo.
They were beautiful.	Ba ne ba le batle.
The police do not know what to do.	Mapolesa ha a tsebe hore na a etse joang.
He was doing a good job.	O ne a etsa mosebetsi o motle.
Many people do.	Batho ba bangata ba etsa joalo.
I love everything about it.	Ke rata tsohle ka eona.
I hope he doesn't go.	Ke tšepa a ke ke a ea.
He was a young man who knew the situation.	E ne e le mohlankana ea tsebang boemo.
She was.	O ne a le.
This food is.	Lijo tsena ke.
You are the father of a boy.	U ntate oa moshanyana.
We did not, so we could not.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo, kahoo ha rea ​​ka ra khona.
I think more than that.	Ke nahana hore ho feta moo.
He came home happy every day.	O ne a tla hae letsatsi le letsatsi a thabile.
You don't see it.	Ha o e bone.
He must come.	O tlameha ho tla.
You may even like it.	U ka ba ua e rata.
So we came up with something out of the ordinary.	Kahoo re ile ra tla le ho hong ho sebelisa seo.
We needed someone like him there.	Re ne re hloka motho ea tšoanang le eena moo.
You know, like the sun.	Ua tseba, joalo ka letsatsi.
I found her to be very nice.	Ke ile ka mo fumana a le motle haholo.
He did not know these people.	O ne a sa tsebe batho bana.
It's weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang.
He did not expect that.	O ne a sa lebella seo.
I did not understand the reason for this.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise lebaka la sena.
He was there.	O bile teng.
That father was another man.	Ntate eo e ne e le monna e mong.
It should not.	Ha ea lokela.
Everyone knows that much.	E mong le e mong o tseba hakaalo.
And he wanted it.	Mme o ne a e batla.
They can help.	Ba ka thusa.
They will find him.	Ba tla mo fumana.
He may not have seen her.	E ka 'na eaba ha ea ka ea mo bona.
You have to be careful.	O lokela ho hlokomela.
It needs to be good enough.	E hloka ho ba hantle ho lekana.
He wants to get to them.	O batla ho fihla ho bona.
However, he was a great man.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a le moholo.
We can no longer stand.	Ha re sa khona ho ema.
You can take them or leave them as you like.	U ka li nka kapa ua li tlohela kamoo u ratang kateng.
My father was not older than we are now when it happened.	Ntate o ne a se moholo ho re feta hona joale ha e etsahala.
They are not human.	Ha se batho.
I still believe it is a good idea.	Ke ntse ke lumela hore ke mohopolo o motle.
It's not a very good thing.	Ha se ntho e ntle haholo.
This was not a good thing at all.	Sena e ne e se ntho e ntle hakaalo.
We talked a lot.	Re ile ra bua haholo.
Somewhere.	Kae kae.
I feel like our time is near.	Ke utloa eka nako ea rona e haufi.
It's not too long, and it won't be out until next week.	Ha se nako e telele haholo, 'me e ke ke ea tsoa ho fihlela bekeng e tlang.
We should try this again soon, so we need to know then.	Re lokela ho leka sena hape haufinyane, kahoo re lokela ho tseba ka nako eo.
Please consider this as you read.	Ka kopo nahana ka sena ha u ntse u bala.
Let's talk about it.	A re bue ka eona.
Plus I didn’t have to think.	Ho feta moo ho ne ho sa hlokahale hore ke nahane.
I can't look that long in advance.	Ha ke khone ho sheba nako e telele hakaalo esale pele.
Maybe they'll be better.	Mohlomong ba tla be ba le betere.
And these things come in handy for some money.	'Me lintho tsena li kopana le chelete e itseng.
And then you can have one and love it, too.	'Me joale u ka ba le e' ngoe 'me ua e rata, hape.
I did not do that.	Ke ne ke sa etsa joalo.
So that's the first one.	Kahoo ke ea pele.
We could have found a way.	Re ka be re ile ra fumana tsela.
I don’t know if it has it or not.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e na le eona kapa che.
The power of positive thinking, or something like that.	Matla a ho nahana hantle, kapa ntho e kang eo.
And family.	Le lelapa.
He also did what he said he would do.	Hape e entse seo e se buileng.
It does not tell us.	Ha e re bolelle.
It would have been fun.	Ho ka be ho bile monate.
This much but he did.	Sena haholo empa o ile a se etsa.
I have books.	Ke na le libuka.
We took whatever they allowed.	Re ne re nka eng kapa eng eo ba neng ba e lumella.
Then he left.	Eaba oa tsamaea.
But then he decided to find out.	Empa joale o ile a etsa qeto ea ho tseba.
Because you do not know what will happen.	Hobane ha o tsebe se tlang ho etsahala.
This is great fun for production.	Sena se monate haholo bakeng sa tlhahiso.
He could ask.	O ne a ka botsa.
There was another group in front of him.	Ho ne ho e-na le sehlopha se seng ka pele ho eena.
I would like that.	Nka rata joalo.
No one knows why.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na ke hobane'ng.
Husband and father.	Monna le ntate.
He really needed her.	Ehlile o ne a mo hloka.
It can do such a thing.	E ka etsa ntho e joalo.
But how? 	Empa joang?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
I sat down.	Ke ile ka lula fatše.
He is the greatest of them all.	Ke moholo ho feta efe kapa efe ya tsona.
They were the only ones who did not see him that way.	Ke bona feela ba neng ba sa mo bone ka tsela eo.
He was there, he knew now.	O ne a le teng, o ne a tseba jwale.
Somehow he was tired.	Ka tsela e itseng o ne a khathetse.
She does not have enough time to do the things she wants.	Ha a na nako e lekaneng ea ho etsa lintho tseo a li batlang.
The girl is calling.	Ngoanana oa letsa.
We must see.	Re tlameha ho bona.
I was dangerous.	Ke ne ke le kotsi.
They were all there.	Kaofela ba ne ba le teng.
I don't know that girl.	Ha ke tsebe ngoanana eo.
But he does.	Empa oa etsa joalo.
You will need that.	O tla hloka seo.
That would be better.	Hoo ho ka ba molemo.
He really didn't know.	O ne a hlile a sa tsebe.
We know that everyone can have a better life.	Rea tseba hore motho e mong le e mong a ka fumana bophelo bo betere.
His mind was working.	Kelello ea hae e ne e sebetsa.
We ride with them.	Re palama le bona.
I just got one.	Ke sa tsoa fumana e le 'ngoe.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
It is a way of life.	Ke tsela ea bophelo.
We will definitely be back anyway.	Ka sebele re tla khutla leha ho le joalo.
She feels like a girl.	O ikutloa joaloka ngoanana.
It was not surprising.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale ka mokhoa o makatsang.
You can have breakfast at school.	U ka ja lijo tsa hoseng sekolong.
So many people see this as a bad thing.	Kahoo batho ba bangata ba bona sena e le ntho e mpe.
She would be with her husband.	O ne a tla ba le monna oa hae.
But he did not seem to notice.	Empa o ne a sa bonahale a hlokomela.
If he had to be honest, they would not be just friends.	Haeba a ne a lokela ho bua 'nete, e ka be e se metsoalle feela.
Back to work.	Khutlela mosebetsing.
Of course we met again.	Ehlile re ile ra kopana hape.
It worked for us.	E ile ea re tsoela molemo.
But it will not.	Empa e ke ke.
That seemed logical.	Seo se ne se bonahala eka ke kelello.
That worked well.	Seo se ile sa sebetsa hantle.
I can no longer love.	Ha ke sa khona ho rata.
But even that was not enough.	Empa le hoo ho ne ho sa lekana.
So no one talks to her.	Kahoo, ha ho motho ea buang le eena.
We hope it gets to you, too.	Re tšepa hore e tla kena ho ea hau, hape.
That should be good news.	Tseo e lokela ho ba litaba tse monate.
You can re-create your site.	U ka etsa sebaka sa hau hape.
Then they returned to work.	Eaba ba khutlela mosebetsing.
For us it was an opportunity to give.	Ho rona e ne e le monyetla oa ho fana.
He decided to abandon the proposal.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho tlohela tlhahiso eo.
We buy like everyone else.	Re reka joalo ka batho bohle.
They no longer touch you.	Ha ba sa hlola ba u tšoara.
I can say that we became friends.	Nka ba ka re re ile ra ba metsoalle.
I do not have it.	Ha ke na eona.
I know my dad always helps.	Kea tseba hore ntate oa ka o thusa nako le nako.
But there was nothing harmless that night.	Empa ho ne ho se letho le se nang kotsi bosiung boo.
This has.	Sena se na le.
Until that is exactly what happened.	Ho fihlela ke sona se etsahetseng hantle.
Have a group.	E-ba le sehlopha.
My life has just begun.	Bophelo ba ka bo sa tsoa qala.
It can't be.	E ka se be jwalo.
Her only child was her first child.	Ngoana oa hae a le mong e ne e le ngoana oa pele.
This is really hard for me.	Sena se hlile se thata ho 'na.
Same type from the beginning.	Mofuta o tšoanang ho tloha pele.
Now, we're going to sleep.	Jwale, re ilo robala.
You know exactly.	U tseba hantle.
It was my turn.	E ne e le nako ea ka.
I'm trying to think of something.	Ke leka ho nahana ka se seng.
I need you here too.	Ke u hloka le nna mona.
We are very happy to have found it.	Re thabile haholo hore ebe re o fumane.
But I'm not sure.	Empa ha ke na bonnete.
However, I worked on it.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ile ka sebetsa ho eona.
I know what these are like.	Kea tseba hore na tsena li joang.
I do not do such things.	Ha ke etse lintho tse joalo.
I did not sleep.	Ha kea robala.
Because that would not be good.	Hobane seo se ka se be setle.
Even a dog.	Leha e le ntja.
It is too late to ask questions.	Nako e se e le morao haholo ho botsa lipotso.
It was not his business.	E ne e se taba ea hae.
He is here now.	O teng hona jwale.
It works well for me.	E sebetsa hantle ho nna.
I hold it together.	Ke e tšoara hammoho.
There is a way for everyone.	Ho na le tsela bakeng sa bohle.
Getting in and out.	Ho tsoa le ho kena.
Maybe one day there will be a time.	Mohlomong ka letsatsi le leng ho tla ba le nako.
He has never done anything.	Ha a eso etse letho.
So forget about the idea.	Kahoo lebala ka maikutlo.
That helps.	Seo se a thusa.
Because they felt that way.	Hobane ba ne ba ikutloa joalo.
But he did not find anything.	Empa ha aa ka a fumana letho.
And that's what it is.	Mme ke seo e leng sona.
I will try very hard.	Ke tla leka ka matla haholo.
You have to go and meet others.	O lokela ho ya kopana le ba bang.
They wanted to talk.	Ba ne ba batla ho bua.
But look at us now.	Empa sheba rona jwale.
But he is definitely a good player.	Empa ka sebele sebapali se setle.
The risk of injury was high.	Monyetla oa kotsi o ne o le moholo.
I never thought about it.	Ke ne ke eso nahane ka hona.
Some work very well.	Ba bang ba sebetsa hantle haholo.
Now it’s just a matter of me doing my thing.	Joale ke taba feela ea hore ke etsa ntho ea ka.
It's weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang.
Or to make sure someone does.	Kapa ho etsa bonnete ba hore motho o etsa joalo.
You have to understand how important it is to know me.	U tlameha ho utloisisa hore na ho bohlokoa hakae ho tseba ho 'na.
Maybe he is doing that.	Mohlomong o ntse a etsa joalo.
Isn't that really something.	Na ehlile hase ntho e itseng.
What was he doing.	O ne a etsa eng.
Work benefited him.	Mosebetsing o ile oa mo tsoela molemo.
You will be back home soon.	U tla khutlela hae haufinyane.
We will consider your suggestion.	Re tla nahana ka tlhahiso ea hau.
Eventually you will meet him tomorrow.	Qetellong u tla kopana le eena hosane.
Thanks for all we have.	Re leboha sohle seo re nang le sona.
That is a simple question.	Ke potso e bonolo.
He gave her money.	O ile a mo fa chelete.
This is a coincidence.	Hona ke ho kopana ha taba.
He said bad things about Dad.	O ile a bua lintho tse mpe ka Ntate.
Some people need to eat less.	Batho ba bang ba hloka ho ja hanyane.
I'm sorry, but it won't help.	Ke masoabi, empa e ke ke ea thusa.
They talk about it.	Ba bua ka eona.
Love the memory !.	Rata mohopolo!.
That is strange news.	Tseo ke litaba tse makatsang.
It's so fun to see it.	Ho monate haholo ho o bona.
We need to ride.	Re hloka ho palama.
I just want to forget it all.	Ke mpa ke batla ho e lebala kaofela.
It doesn't make sense.	Ha e na kelello.
We have food.	Re na le lijo.
We write more, but we learn less.	Re ngola ho feta, empa re ithuta hanyane.
He seemed to have just finished working.	O ne a bonahala eka o qeta ho sebetsa.
When you go, go.	Ha u tsamaea, tsamaea.
I'll have to get back to this one.	Ke tla tlameha ho khutlela ho ena.
We hope to see you.	Re tšepa ho u bona.
We want everyone to go away very happy.	Re batla hore bohle ba tsamaee ba thabile haholo.
He loves us so much.	O re rata haholo.
You do the best you can.	U etsa seo u ka se khonang.
Now none of that will happen.	Joale ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tseo e tla etsahala.
It is necessary, but it is not enough.	Hoa hlokahala, empa ha hoa lekana.
I wonder what he is doing now.	Kea ipotsa hore na joale o ntse a etsa eng.
No one said anything.	Ha ho motho ya ileng a bua letho.
Take what you need.	Nka seo u se hlokang.
He was expecting to be at the party.	O ne a lebeletse hore o tla be a le moketeng.
And it is very early in the morning.	Mme ho sa le hoseng haholo.
Sometimes people say it's just the mind.	Ka linako tse ling batho ba re ke kelello feela.
It's really beautiful.	E ntle ruri.
It will be as you say.	Ho tla ba joalo ka ha u bolela.
Do your best, he said.	Etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang, a re.
I will give them to you.	Ke tla u fa tsona.
Now he just wanted to know.	Joale o ne a se a batla ho tseba feela.
The food is very tasty.	Lijo li monate haholo.
We loved everything about the house and its place.	Re ne re rata ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ka ntlo le sebaka sa eona.
Mainly because it was good to play.	Haholo hobane ho ne ho le molemo ho bapala.
It was even better.	Ho ne ho le betere le ho feta.
He cried out to me.	A lla ho nna.
So how to do it.	Kahoo mokhoa oa ho e etsa.
Delicious food.	Lijo tse monate.
Time always looks bad.	Nako e lula e shebahala e le mpe.
And now, she loves it.	Mme jwale, o a e rata.
She doesn't know what she has, but she doesn't care.	A sa tsebe seo a nang le sona, empa a sa tsotelle.
My hands are stiff because of years of hard work.	Matsoho a ka a thata ka lebaka la ho sebetsa ka thata lilemo tse ngata.
Friends of friends.	Metsoalle ea metsoalle.
This is better.	Sena se betere.
There is only one.	Ho na le e le 'ngoe feela.
There was no room for suspicion.	Ho ne ho se sebaka sa ho belaela.
He knew they would never meet again.	O ne a tseba hore ha ba sa tla kopana hape.
I'll be here tomorrow.	Ke tla mona hosane.
No one knows what will happen to him.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na ho tla etsahala'ng ka eena.
I opened his mind.	Ke ile ka bula kelello ea hae.
But it was definitely a very strange thing.	Empa ka sebele e ne e le ntho e makatsang haholo.
We forget, you go see.	Rea lebala, o ya bona.
I'm done with energy.	Ke qetile ka matla.
I like living without work.	Ke rata ho phela ntle le mosebetsi.
I want to live a little longer.	Ke batla ho phela bophelo hanyane.
Now it was time to work on the others.	Joale e ne e le nako ea ho sebetsa ho tse ling.
Do a better job.	Etsa mosebetsi o betere.
But this is not the case.	Empa sena ha se joalo.
But problems were imminent.	Empa mathata a ne a le haufi.
I just left home.	Ke sa tsoa tloha hae.
The house is still empty.	Ntlo e ntse e se na motho.
I would speak.	ke ne ke tla bua.
The second one can probably do it.	Ea bobeli mohlomong a ka e etsa.
I have a good idea.	Ke na le mohopolo o motle.
It represents your feelings.	E emetse maikutlo a hau.
We can try.	Re ka leka.
It's close, so it's very easy.	E haufi, kahoo e bonolo haholo.
Just leave.	Tloha feela.
She does not mind.	Ha a tsotelle.
I did not want to leave him.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho mo tlohela.
She is a woman by the way.	Ke mosali ka tsela.
They could not walk or talk.	Ba ne ba sa khone ho tsamaea kapa ho bua.
It takes too long.	Ho nka nako e telele haholo.
It is actually a very nice house to live in.	Ha e le hantle ke ntlo e ntle haholo ho lula ho eona.
It says the children got the water they did not ask for.	E re bana ba fumane metsi ha ba a kopa.
And nothing more.	Mme ha ho letho le leng hape.
That's a good thing.	Ke taba e ntle.
Here is the point.	Taba ea taba ke ena.
You have a certain status here.	O na le boemo bo itseng mona.
But it was useless.	Empa ho ne ho se na thuso.
But that is just my opinion.	Empa eo ke maikutlo a ka feela.
All my friends are there.	Metsoalle ea ka kaofela e teng.
He is not at home.	Ha a eo hae.
This will make your hair softer.	Sena se tla etsa hore moriri oa hau o be bonolo.
He did really well.	O entse hantle ruri.
She cried softly.	A lla ka bonolo.
She is not in her room.	Ha e eo ka kamoreng ea hae.
He had done that.	O ne a entse seo.
We have children.	Re na le bana.
Three years later, she met him.	Ka mor'a lilemo tse tharo, o ile a kopana le eena.
He was reading a book.	O ne a bala buka.
But let me tell you something.	Empa e re ke o bolelle ho hong.
There is no one stronger than he.	Haho ya matla ho mo feta.
When you say yes, it starts.	Ha u re e, e qala.
Meet him.	Kopana le eena.
He was due to start next week.	O ne a lokela ho qala bekeng e tlang.
So we don't do it.	Kahoo ha re e etse.
Read a few more things.	Bala le lintho tse ling tse seng kae.
Then, it would be.	Ka nako eo, ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
If you want to understand them, you must have them.	Haeba u batla ho li utloisisa, u lokela ho ba le tsona.
No one had ever believed in him before.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a lumela ho eena pele.
In this house human life, as it were.	Ntlo ena bophelo ba motho, joalo ka ha bo le teng.
We were together every day.	Re ne re le hammoho letsatsi le letsatsi.
I started thinking about the car and the team.	Ke ile ka qala ho nahana ka koloi le sehlopha.
It kept coming.	Ya nna ya tla.
This is absurd.	Sena ha se na kelello.
Of course, there are problems.	Ke ’nete hore ho na le mathata.
I am very sad.	Ke utloile bohloko haholo.
And now is the time.	Mme jwale ke nako.
All would come right in the end.	Bohle ba ne ba tla tla hantle qetellong.
I am a doctor.	Ke ngaka.
I agreed.	Ke ile ka lumela.
They have it all.	Ba na le tsohle.
Start with one question.	Qala ka potso e le 'ngoe.
I love the idea, it really makes my day !.	Ke rata maikutlo, a hlile a etsa letsatsi la ka!.
I felt there was a problem coming.	Ke ile ka utloa ho na le bothata bo tlang.
Very strange things.	Lintho tse makatsang haholo.
I have to be there.	Ke tlameha ho ba teng.
The idea is really simple.	Mohopolo o hlile o bonolo.
No, there are no problems here.	Che, ha ho na mathata mona.
He did nothing wrong.	O ne a sa etsa letho le phoso.
But he did not stay there long.	Empa ha aa ka a lula moo nako e telele.
Which can be fun.	E leng ho ka ba monate.
Look what you did.	Sheba seo o se entseng.
There is.	Ho na le.
He never was.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba teng.
However, he returned to work.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a khutlela sebakeng sa mosebetsi.
It was my situation when your letter arrived.	E ne e le boemo ba ka ha lengolo la hau le fihla.
Some refuse.	Ba bang ba hana.
I saw it again last night with my kids.	Ke e bone hape bosiung ba maobane le bana ba ka.
It was empty now.	E ne e se e se na letho joale.
Emotions are strong and people always come back to.	Maikutlo a matla 'me batho ba lula ba khutlela ho.
As you can.	Joalo ka ha u ka khona.
He has to keep her fresh.	O tlameha ho mo boloka a le ncha.
I can help.	Nka khona ho thusa.
He said it would be the strength of the team.	O itse e tla ba matla a sehlopha.
You can trust him.	U ka mo tšepa.
In my opinion, it was not so good.	Ka maikutlo a ka, e ne e se ntle hakaalo.
But, it was not just a ride.	Empa, e ne e se ho palama feela.
Have you ever seen it before?	A na u kile ua e bona pele?
They are just beautiful.	Li ntle feela.
I am a morning man.	Ke motho oa hoseng.
In fact, probably more than ever.	Ha e le hantle, mohlomong ho feta leha e le neng pele.
She was looking for him, but he did not understand her.	O ne a mo batla, empa a sa mo utloisise.
I always did.	Ke ne ke lula ke etsa joalo.
Maybe you didn't realize it.	Mohlomong ha ua e hlokomela.
You will meet him soon.	U tla kopana le eena haufinyane.
He just doesn't get it.	Ha a e fumane feela.
When you need it.	Ha o hloka.
The first thing they do is make money.	Ntho ea pele eo ba e etsang ke ho etsa chelete ka eona.
Someone he knows, more or less.	Motho eo a mo tsebang, ho feta kapa hanyane.
You could not read or hear about anything else.	U ne u ke ke ua bala kapa ua utloa ka ntho leha e le efe e 'ngoe.
She doesn't have to look at him like that.	Ha a tlameha ho mo sheba joalo.
You are not sure if it is a good idea or not.	Ha u na bonnete ba hore na ke mohopolo o motle kapa che.
Find their favorite place.	Fumana sebaka sa bona se monate.
And that was the first problem.	'Me e ne e le mathata a pele.
I am very tired.	Ke khathetse haholo.
We will not get a second chance.	Ha re na ho fumana monyetla oa bobeli.
He declined to comment on what had happened.	O ile a hana ho bua ka se etsahetseng.
Then he will fall asleep.	Joale o tla robala.
Before going to bed, she noticed how beautiful she was.	Pele a robala, o ile a hlokomela kamoo a neng a le motle kateng.
From there, let go.	Ho tloha moo, tlohela ho feta.
Of course, we can love it.	Ha e le hantle, re ka e rata.
Who did not care.	Eo a neng a sa tsotelle.
However, it is a good idea.	Leha ho le joalo, ke mohopolo o motle.
Everyone has a chance.	E mong le e mong o na le monyetla.
If so, it does not matter why you did so.	Haeba ho joalo, ha ho na taba hore na ke hobane'ng ha u entse joalo.
I need more.	Ke hloka ho feta.
It can't happen.	E ke ke ea etsahala.
Being on foot was hard enough.	Ho ba ka maoto ho ne ho le boima ka ho lekaneng.
Then go as fast as you can.	Joale tsamaea kapele kamoo u ka khonang.
Sometimes we even provided them with food.	Ka linako tse ling re ne re ba fa le lijo.
Big and strong, he had nothing.	A le moholo a bile a le matla, o ne a se na letho.
No problem finding a place.	Ha ho bothata ho fumana sebaka.
He had to stand.	O ne a lokela ho ema.
He did not visit a doctor.	Ha aa ka a etela ngaka.
I should not say the truth.	Ha kea lokela ho bua joalo ka 'nete.
The first one comes out.	Ea pele e tsoa.
Decide how you spend your money.	Etsa qeto ea hore na o sebelisa chelete joang.
He will never love you.	Le ka mohla a ke ke a o rata.
Will do.	Ke tla etsa joalo.
It can be very difficult.	Ho ka ba thata haholo.
I was no longer human.	Ke ne ke se ke se motho.
And as always, the good ones also suffer.	'Me joalo ka kamehla, ba molemo le bona ba utloa bohloko.
It was difficult at the time.	Ho ne ho le thata ka nako eo.
The police must be back.	Mapolesa a tlameha a be a khutla.
You write because you have to.	U ngola hobane u tlameha.
They can do this.	Ba ka etsa sena.
I hope to see him again soon !.	Ke tšepa ho mo bona hape haufinyane!.
The child did not seem to understand the question.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ngoana ha a utloisise potso eo.
We do not have to wait.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho ema.
I would love to live here again.	Nka thabela ho lula mona hape.
They were very close.	Ba ne ba le haufi haholo.
Use a group.	Sebelisa sehlopha.
I kept thinking about it.	Ke ne ke lula ke nahana ka eona.
We'll see how this goes.	Re tla bona hore na sena se tsamaea joang.
Sometimes it can be beneficial.	Ka linako tse ling li ka ba molemo.
I don't think he'll notice.	Ha ke nahane hore o tla hlokomela.
That is, if people feel they want to use it that way.	Ke hore, haeba batho ba ikutloa ba batla ho li sebelisa ka tsela eo.
But no one seems to know where he is.	Empa ho bonahala ho se motho ea tsebang moo a leng teng.
I told her that I had nothing to speak about.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore ha ho letho leo nka buang ka lona.
That is what the friends did.	Ke seo metsoalle e ileng ea se etsa.
He is the best.	O molemo ka ho fetisisa.
It says it used to be fun.	E re e kile ya ba monate.
Do not stay here to sleep again.	U se ke ua lula mona ho robala hape.
Our job is to help children learn.	Mosebetsi oa rona ke ho thusa bana ho ithuta.
We all need to do better.	Kaofela re lokela ho etsa betere.
The child should be able to see that.	Ngoana o lokela ho khona ho bona seo.
If you've been here, you know.	Haeba u bile mona, ua tseba.
He just knows.	O tseba feela.
You can tell a man's age by their condition.	U ka tseba lilemo tsa monna ka boemo ba bona.
But we can do something about it.	Empa re ka etsa ho hong ka sena.
This book is about his life.	Buka ena e bua ka bophelo ba hae.
That's me.	Ke 'na eo.
Now here is the problem.	Joale bothata ke bona.
I want to fix things.	Ke batla ho lokisa litaba.
Do the work.	Etsa mosebetsi.
Someone he knows.	Motho eo a mo tsebang.
You do not need to tell me.	Ha o hloke ho mpolella.
I mean anything.	Ke bolela eng kapa eng.
Of course, it should not be that way.	Ehlile, ha ho a lokela ho ba ka tsela eo.
There has been another recently.	Ho bile le e 'ngoe haufinyane.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho tsamaea.
That's why they're probably not with you.	Ke kahoo mohlomong ha ba eo le uena.
Or maybe because of it.	Kapa mohlomong ka lebaka la eona.
He goes to tell them that.	O ya ba bolella seo.
I like it.	Kea e rata.
You will never give up.	Le ka mohla u ke ke ua tlohela.
It is the simplest of all.	Ke e bonolo ho feta tsohle.
It's still very simple.	E ntse e le bonolo haholo.
The party was in full swing.	Mokete o ne o se o ntse o tsoela pele.
But dinner does not seem like dinner.	Empa lijo tsa mantsiboea ha li bonahale eka ke lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I was afraid to take a chance.	Ke ne ke tšaba ho nka monyetla.
Because that's not enough reason.	Hobane seo hase lebaka le lekaneng.
You no longer have such a wonderful day.	Ha u sa ba le letsatsi le monate hakana.
He is drinking coffee.	O ntse a noa kofi.
We cannot convince him.	Re ke ke ra mo kholisa.
Whatever he was looking for, well, he did not find.	Eng kapa eng eo e neng e e batla, hantle, ha ea ka ea e fumana.
Yes, here it is.	E, ke ena.
True.	'Nete.
He prepared a delicious meal	O ile a lokisa lijo tse monate
That's a very good question.	Ke potso e ntle haholo.
And now he wants to go home.	Mme jwale o batla ho ya hae.
He really didn't care.	O ne a hlile a sa tsotelle.
It must be you.	E tlameha ebe ke uena.
He says he is very happy, very, very happy to meet you.	O re o thabile haholo, haholo, haholo ho kopana le wena.
You say nothing.	Ha o bue letho.
It will be very fun.	Ho tla ba monate haholo.
I knew him, of course.	Ke ne ke mo tseba, ehlile.
Indeed, you do well to help him.	Ka sebele, u etsa hantle ha u mo thusa.
It took the police three hours to arrive.	Mapolesa a ile a nka lihora tse tharo ho fihla.
Look at this picture carefully.	Sheba setšoantšo sena ka hloko.
My mother often has.	'Mè hangata o na le.
Maybe they'll come back.	Mohlomong ba tla khutla.
That's another way to look at it.	Ke mokhoa o mong oa ho e sheba.
I have no head in it.	Ha ke na hlooho ho eona.
Its name literally means whatever you like.	Lebitso la eona ha e le hantle le bolela eng kapa eng eo u e ratang.
The team only played for three hours.	Sehlopha se ne se bapala lihora tse tharo feela.
She looks very pretty.	O shebahala a le motle haholo.
Read the book.	Bala buka.
The production lasted only a few days.	Tlhahiso e ne e sebetsa matsatsi a 'maloa feela.
You are useless.	Ha u na thuso.
There is a time to do something.	Ho na le nako ea ho etsa ho hong.
Imagine the connection.	Nahana hore ho kopane.
He never said a word about this when we first entered.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua letho ka sena ha re qala ho kena.
Some thought he was crazy.	Ba bang ba ne ba nahana hore ha a na kelello.
They have breakfast.	Ba ja lijo tsa hoseng.
Ask that pretty girl about the day.	Botsa ngoanana eo e motle ka letsatsi.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
We have to go to work tomorrow.	Re tlameha ho ea mosebetsing hosane.
I wanted to go my own way.	Ke ne ke batla ho ea ka maikutlo a ka.
You are useless.	Ha o na thuso.
See you tomorrow.	Ke tla u bona hosane.
I really enjoy helping others.	Ke hlile ke rata ho thusa ba bang.
Once you're done, exit through the back door.	Hang ha o qetile, tsoa ka lemati le ka morao.
This is our only job.	Ona ke mosebetsi oa rona feela.
It was a long road.	E ne e le tsela e telele.
You have to finish.	O tlameha ho qeta.
If you live there and do not like it, leave.	Haeba u lula moo 'me u sa e rate, tsamaea.
Her husband agrees.	Monna oa hae oa lumela.
And she was in the back room.	Mme o ne a le ka kamoreng e ka morao.
I know every dog ​​by name.	Ke tseba ntja e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ka lebitso.
Try it with him.	Leka le eena.
I need to eat.	Ke hloka ho ja lijo.
It's up to you what you want.	Ho ho uena hore na u batla eng.
I like not to sit next to him.	Ke thabela ho se lule haufi le eena.
That is the way life should be.	Ke kamoo bophelo bo lokelang ho ba kateng.
It has been difficult, though.	Ho bile thata, leha ho le joalo.
Moreover,.	Ho feta moo,.
however.	leha ho le joalo.
That would not have happened today.	Seo se ka be se sa etsahala kajeno.
I am in danger.	Ke kotsing.
Sorry I had to ask.	Ke masoabi ke ile ka tlameha ho botsa.
She started to feel better after she went to bed.	O ile a qala ho ikutloa a le betere ha a qeta ho robala.
It's weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang.
I wondered if she was feeling tired again.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na ebe o ikutloa a khathetse hape.
Still, there seemed to be something they could do.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho bonahala eka ho na le seo ba ka se etsang.
See what they do.	Bona seo ba se etsang.
He was not a man.	E ne e se motho.
He did not say why, but the reason was clear.	Ha aa ka a bolela lebaka, empa lebaka le ne le hlakile.
You speak too fast.	U bua kapele haholo.
I'll finish now.	Ke tla qeta jwale.
I hope you don't have to come here.	Ke tšepa hore ha ua tlameha ho tla mona.
It is better not to tell them anything.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua ba bolella letho.
Coming to this place.	Ho tla sebakeng sena .
Some were good, some were very bad.	Tse ling li ne li le ntle, tse ling li le mpe haholo.
That could be too much.	Seo se ka ba ngata haholo.
I hope to finish it soon.	Ke tšepa hore ke tla e qeta haufinyane.
It was a group.	E ne e le sehlopha.
The ideas are here.	Maikutlo a teng mona.
He was not going to play.	O ne a sa tlo bapala.
The pain of not being there for him.	Bohloko ba ho se be teng bakeng sa hae.
I am very happy with him.	Ke thabile haholo le eena.
However, your feedback is important to us.	Leha ho le joalo, maikutlo a hau a bohlokoa ho rona.
I'm sorry!	Ke masoabi!
He used to sit next to me, we talk a little sometimes.	O ne a lula haufi le nna, re bua hanyane ka linako tse ling.
Children are always asking questions.	Bana ba lula ba botsa lipotso.
He simply refused.	O ne a hana feela.
Walk as if it means something to you.	Tsamaea joalo ka ha ho bolela ho hong ho uena.
People believe in useless things.	Batho ba lumela lintho tse se nang thuso.
They did a great job with that.	Ba entse mosebetsi o motle ka seo.
However, he is still writing it well.	Leha ho le joalo, o ntse a e ngola hantle.
I never think of him that way.	Ha ho mohla ke nahanang ka eena ka tsela eo.
The issue was dangerous.	Taba e ne e le kotsi.
This made my day.	Sena se entse letsatsi la ka.
When should we expect it?	Re lokela ho u lebella neng?
Please go here.	Ke kopa u ee mona.
I like driving.	Ke rata ho khanna.
Pain would only exist.	Bohloko bo ne bo tla ba teng feela.
His parents did not like him.	Batsoali ba hae ba ne ba sa mo rate.
It plays on my strength.	E bapala ka matla a ka.
Others before him were able to do so.	Ba bang pele ho eena ba ile ba khona ho etsa joalo.
Of some kind.	Ea mofuta o itseng.
Do not try this at home.	O seke wa leka sena hae.
Happy to help.	Ke thabetse ho thusa.
I still have to decide whether to go or not.	Ke ntse ke tlameha ho etsa qeto ea hore na ke tsamaee kapa che.
And now he could not let her go.	Mme jwale o ne a ke ke a mo tlohela.
No such situation exists here.	Ha ho boemo bo joalo bo teng mona.
At the time, he did not care.	Ka nako eo, o ne a sa tsotelle.
He did not look at her or at anyone else.	Ha a ka a mo sheba kapa ho sheba motho e mong.
Then he realized that they could not.	Eaba oa hlokomela hore ba ke ke ba khona.
Apparently it looked like that because it was.	Hoa bonahala hore ho ne ho shebahala joalo hobane ho ne ho le joalo.
I hope you all had a great week.	Kea tšepa kaofela ha lona le bile le beke e monate.
There is nothing but you.	Ha ho letho le leng ntle le uena.
And thank you.	Mme kea leboha.
He came just right.	A tla hantle feela.
I mean, maybe they will.	Ke bolela, mohlomong ba tla.
We can just stop and see.	Re ka ema feela mme re bone.
If you like, you can watch them.	Haeba u rata, u ka li sheba.
They wanted nothing to do with this place.	Ba ne ba sa batle letho ka sebaka sena.
Of course, he did not.	Ha e le hantle, ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
My stomach feels empty.	Mpa ea ka e utloa e se na letho.
Something else you have to work on.	Ntho e 'ngoe eo u lokelang ho e sebetsa.
I will be here anyway.	Ke tla ba mona leha e ka ba teng.
That it is better than life.	Hore ho molemo ho feta bophelo.
It could have been better.	Ho ka be ho bile betere.
I know it's early in the morning, but we have to go.	Kea tseba hore esale hoseng, empa re tlameha ho tsamaea.
People need to take advantage of that opportunity.	Batho ba lokela ho sebelisa monyetla oo.
Well, here we are.	Be, ke rona bana.
The party was in full swing.	Mokete o ne o ntse o tsoela pele.
You will not believe this.	U ke ke ua lumela sena.
He looks like that man.	O shebahala jwalo ka monna eo.
Moreover, they look very nice.	Ho feta moo, li shebahala li le ntle haholo.
I could just see something else.	Nka mpa ka bona ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I was older than him, though.	Ke ne ke le moholo ho eena, leha ho le joalo.
Now he was not sure.	Joale o ne a se na bonnete.
I think they know he's close.	Ke nahana hore baa tseba hore o haufi.
They should not do that.	Ha baa lokela ho etsa joalo.
You know about some.	U tseba ka tse ling.
He doesn't have to use them.	Ha a tlameha ho li sebelisa.
None of us do that, but we should love.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea etsang joalo, empa re lokela ho rata.
The children were playing outside.	Bana ba ne ba bapala ka ntle.
I would love to talk to you today if you are present.	Ke rata ho bua le uena kajeno haeba u le teng.
You learn what you should do, or what you should not do.	U ithuta seo u lokelang ho se etsa, kapa seo u sa lokelang ho se etsa.
Pick it up and go.	E nke 'me u tsamaee.
He was able to.	O ile a khona.
That's what it's there for.	Ke seo e leng teng moo.
He did not understand.	O ne a sa utloisise.
Unless he was still there.	Ntle le hore o ne a ntse a le teng.
This is what they did even when the time came.	Sena ke sona seo ba ileng ba se etsa le ha nako e fihla.
They bought it simply because they could afford it.	Ba ile ba e reka hobane feela ba ne ba khona ho e reka.
She took her husband.	A nka monna wa hae.
The food is not very tasty.	Lijo ha li monate haholo.
Of course it is.	Ehlile ho jwalo.
We did our best to be good parents.	Re ne re etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang hore re be batsoali ba molemo.
It's been a while since you've been working on them.	E se e le nako u ntse u sebetsa ka tsona.
He had never seen this coming.	O ne a eso bone sena se tlang.
They have no power to do so.	Ha ba na matla a ho etsa joalo.
He did not find anyone.	Ha aa ka a fumana motho.
He had one and said yes.	O ne a e-na le e 'ngoe 'me a re ho joalo.
You need help.	U hloka thuso.
I am happy now.	Ke thabile hona joale.
Many parents refuse to have children.	Batsoali ba bangata ba hana ho ba le bana.
I have to get in now.	Ke tlameha ho kena hona joale.
So that’s exactly what we do.	Kahoo ke hantle seo re se etsang.
She loves to help.	O rata ho thusa.
For me, for my team.	Bakeng sa ka, bakeng sa sehlopha sa ka.
I have never seen anything that does anything that it does.	Ha ke so bone ntho leha e le efe e etsang ntho leha e le efe eo e e etsang.
He stopped.	O ile a ema.
He was a child.	E ne e le ngoana.
We'll see what he has.	Re tla bona seo a nang le sona.
He looked at it but saw nothing more.	O ile a e sheba empa a sa bone letho ho feta moo.
He and your father, are near.	Eena le ntate oa hao, ba haufi.
This was for the best.	Sena e ne e le sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
More will come soon.	Tse ling li tla kena haufinyane.
You did nothing wrong.	Ha o a etsa letho le phoso.
That means you belong to her.	Hoo ho bolela hore o wa hae.
It is very difficult.	Ho thata haholo.
But we had no children.	Mme re ne re se na bana.
I want to talk to my girlfriend.	Ke batla ho bua le ngoanana oa ka.
Anyway, there was somebody there with him.	Ho hong, ho ne ho e-na le motho moo le eena.
Still, it was fun.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le monate.
Maybe he was human.	Mohlomong e ne e le motho.
A simple thing is actually very hard to do right.	Ntho e bonolo ha e le hantle e thata haholo ho e etsa hantle.
The child refused to go to school.	Ngoana o ile a hana ho ea sekolong.
He knows nothing about this.	Ha a tsebe letho ka sena.
I will have to get these.	Ke tla tlameha ho fumana tsena.
The pain is coming again.	Bohloko bo tla hape.
I need to think.	Ke hloka ho nahana.
He found nothing.	Ha aa ka a fumana letho.
They can't see it.	Ba ke ke ba e bona.
Of course, you can go out and buy it.	Ha e le hantle, u ka tsoa 'me ua e reka.
So do not be.	Kahoo u se ke ua ba teng.
It was never fun.	Ha ho mohla ho neng ho se monate.
They would meet.	Ba ne ba tla kopana.
It goes beyond what you say.	E feta kamoo o buang kateng.
They all sang along with it.	Bohle ba ne ba bina hammoho le eona.
Or else everyone else felt.	Kapa ba bang kaofela ba ile ba ikutloa.
They had never seen it.	Ba ne ba eso bone.
Not too long ago, though.	Ha se khale haholo, leha ho le joalo.
It doesn't really make sense.	Ha e hlile ha e na kelello.
No one said anything about them.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a bua letho ka bona.
But it was fun !.	Empa ho ne ho le monate!.
He looked the way forward.	O ile a sheba tsela e ka pele.
I just don't know how to make it so.	Ke mpa ke sa tsebe ho etsa hore ho be jwalo.
They wanted food.	Ba ile ba batla lijo.
I certainly have them.	Ka sebele ke na le tsona.
In fact, they are of no use at all.	Ha e le hantle, ha ba na thuso ho hang.
I don't see why they do that.	Ha ke bone hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba etsa joalo.
Because there is another.	Hobane ho na le e 'ngoe.
I could not walk alone.	Ke ne nke ke ka tsamaea ke le mong.
He would call her tomorrow at work.	O ne a tla mo letsetsa hosane a le mosebetsing.
No reason can happen.	Ha ho lebaka le ka etsahalang.
Something wonderful was happening.	Ho ne ho etsahala ntho e makatsang.
To me it seems we have a problem.	Ho 'na ho bonahala eka re na le bothata.
Or, the car can be a problem.	Kapa, ​​​​koloi e ka ba bothata.
It must be.	E tlameha ebe.
The opening ceremony was a real celebration.	Mokete oa ho bula e ne e le mokete oa sebele.
Of course.	Ke 'nete hore.
Say it, once a week.	E re, hang ka beke.
The girl started to cry.	Ngoanana eo a qala ho lla.
I worked there every day.	Ke ne ke sebetsa moo letsatsi le leng le le leng.
I'm afraid he might do that.	Ke tšaba hore a ka 'na a etsa joalo.
I knew exactly what to expect.	Ke ne ke tseba hantle seo ke lokelang ho se lebella.
Please write your work.	Ngola mosebetsi oa hau ka kopo.
He could hear others talking about it.	O ne a utloa feela ba bang ba bua ka eona.
Maybe it was an accident, after all.	Mohlomong e bile kotsi, ka mor'a tsohle.
Only one place.	Sebaka se le seng feela.
She wants a baby.	O batla ngoana.
But it presented the same point.	Empa e ne e fana ka taba e tšoanang.
You know how they walk.	Ua tseba hore na ba tsamaea joang.
We made him.	Re ile ra mo etsa.
I had nothing good to say.	Ke ne ke sena letho le molemo leo nka le buang.
We did so to provide space.	Re ile ra etsa joalo ho fana sebaka.
I would not really do it.	Ke ne nke ke ka e etsa ehlile.
That's just another danger.	Ke kotsi e 'ngoe feela.
That was a mistake.	Eo e ne e le phoso e itseng.
Unless we need your help.	Ntle le hore re hloka thuso ea hau.
Then you have to eat.	Joale u lokela ho ja.
I have seen this several times.	Ke bone sena makhetlo a 'maloa.
He is not a man.	Ha se motho.
I can't go on like this right now.	Ha ke khone ho tsoela pele joalo ka ha joale.
Does anyone know.	Na ho na le motho ea tsebang hantle.
He looked at the girl.	A sheba ngoanana eo.
But it never became mine.	Empa ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba ea ka.
For others, it may not be.	Ho tse ling, ha ho joalo.
I do not understand very well.	Ha ke utloisise hantle.
He lives with his mother, works nights.	O lula le mme, o sebetsa bosiu.
I can work on it.	Nka sebetsa ho eona.
It was illegal for people to do so.	E ne e se molao hore batho ba etse joalo.
He doesn't like the time.	Ha a rate nako eo.
That would be a good thing to do.	Eo e ka ba ntho e ntle ho e etsa.
And it's just beautiful.	Mme e ntle feela.
In this.	Ho sena.
Probably better not to use it.	Mohlomong ho molemo hore ba se ke ba e sebelisa.
It's not too late.	Ha e-so be morao haholo.
I was reading it all.	Ke ne ke le bala kaofela.
So that is what happened.	Kahoo ke sona se ileng sa etsahala.
That would be a very good thing.	Hoo e ka ba ntho e ntle haholo.
There it is.	Ke eo.
I thanked him.	Ke ile ka mo leboha.
I would talk to anyone.	Nka be ke bua le mang kapa mang.
He was happy to meet me.	O ile a thabela ho kopana le 'na.
I do not believe them.	ha ke ba lumele.
We cannot keep the error to a minimum.	Re ke ke ra boloka phoso e se kotsi.
Everyone wanted it that way.	E mong le e mong o ne a batla hore ho be ka tsela eo.
He is not a man of the morning.	Ha se motho wa hoseng.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
No one could have expected them to win.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka lebella hore ba tla hlola.
I have no letter on it.	Ha ke na lengolo ho eona.
The place also had no name.	Sebaka seo le sona se ne se se na lebitso.
The car is their way of life.	Koloi ke tsela ea bona ea bophelo.
Of course, it was bad.	Ehlile, e ne e le mpe.
But it is not a job.	Empa ha se mosebetsi.
Mary wept.	Maria o ile a lla.
However, the house was empty.	Leha ho le joalo, ntlo e ne e se na motho.
No, it does not matter.	Che, ha ho na taba ka seo.
This is immediately after the second.	Sena ke hang ka mor'a ea bobeli.
They need help.	Ba hloka thuso.
It seemed unnecessary.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho sa hlokahale.
I enjoy that, too.	Ke thabela seo, hape.
That is not really the case.	Seo ha se hlile ha se joalo.
It was bad for the team and bad for me.	E ne e le mpe ho sehlopha mme e le mpe ho nna.
Not to be fun to, or to like.	E seng ho ba monate ho, kapa ho rata.
And it's simple.	Mme e bonolo.
When space is important.	Ha sebaka se le bohlokoa.
Just exactly like that.	Hantle feela joalo.
Thank you for taking the trouble.	Kea leboha ha u nkile bothata.
I give her a chance.	Ke mo fa monyetla oa eona.
It was my turn.	E ne e le nako ea ka.
He had to be innocent.	O ne a lokela ho hloka molato.
I got a job.	Ke fumane mosebetsi.
He knows more than that.	O tseba ho feta moo.
I had money.	Ke ne ke e-na le chelete.
That was trying.	Hoo ho ne ho leka.
Many other things.	Lintho tse ling tse ngata.
That time.	Nako eo.
That was not really a question, to put it another way.	Eo e ne e hlile e se potso, ha re bua joalo.
I did not ask him why.	Ha kea ka ka mo botsa hore na ke hobane'ng.
He had long felt that way.	E ne e se e le khale a ikutloa joalo.
He should have finished his homework.	O ne a lokela hore ebe o qetile mosebetsi wa hae wa sekolo.
He had a second to decide what to do.	O ne a na le oa bobeli oa ho etsa qeto ea hore na a etse eng.
We were not sure how much we were predicting.	Re ne re sa tsebe hantle hore na re ne re bua esale pele hakae.
Don't say it.	O seke wa e bua.
They say that this happens sometimes.	Ba re sena se etsahala ka linako tse ling.
I think it's probably too late.	Ke nahana hore mohlomong e se e le morao haholo.
But somehow we did.	Empa ka tsela e itseng re ile ra etsa joalo.
I do not need to continue.	Ha ke hloke ho tsoela pele.
Some even managed.	Ba bang ba bile ba e khona.
he will say.	o tla re.
So it doesn't matter where we do this.	Kahoo ha ho na taba hore na re etsa sena hokae.
He came in.	O ile a kena.
You are my wife.	U mosali oa ka.
Then he would take her.	Joale o ne a tla mo nka.
It was team work.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa sehlopha.
Worth it.	E molemo.
We got everything we needed.	Re ile ra fumana tsohle tseo re li hlokang.
So we wanted to know what we should do now.	Kahoo, re ne re batla ho tseba hore na joale re lokela ho etsa eng.
It is hard to believe that he is no longer with us.	Ho thata ho lumela hore ha a sa na le rōna.
But they refused.	Empa ba ile ba hana.
But it was difficult.	Empa ho ne ho le thata.
In this way, the book begins innocently.	Ka tsela ena, buka e qala ka mokhoa o se nang molato.
You believed he was innocent.	U ne u lumela hore ha a na molato.
No one had ever seen him.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a mo bona.
Of course, there was nothing.	Ha e le hantle, ho ne ho se na letho.
Never more.	Le ka mohla ho feta.
My head starts to cry.	Hlooho ea ka e qala ho lla.
I was able to catch him.	Ke ile ka khona ho mo tšoara.
Maybe you should see a doctor or something.	Mohlomong o lokela ho bona ngaka kapa ho hong.
I see that today.	Ke bona seo kajeno.
All good.	Tsohle tse ntle.
This would not have happened.	Sena se ka be se sa etsahala.
And so it was.	Mme ho bile jwalo.
But their food is delicious.	Empa lijo tsa bona li monate.
I am that woman.	Ke 'na mosali eo.
Or maybe not.	Kapa mohlomong ha ho joalo.
He looks at the books in front of him.	O sheba libuka tse ka pele ho eena.
The phone rings.	Mohala oa lla.
That's what you did.	Ke seo u se entseng.
The children are not without me.	Bana ha ba ntle ho nna.
Her hair is wet.	Moriri oa hae o metsi.
The past is still close to us.	Nako e fetileng e ntse e le haufi le rona.
In fact, the place was already his.	Ha e le hantle, sebaka seo e ne e se e le sa hae.
It will take a long time.	E tla nka nako e telele.
There is no such thing here.	Ha ho na taba e joalo e teng mona.
He told you that and that is what he did.	O o boleletse seo mme ke seo a se etsang.
Having a good time.	Ho ba le nako e monate.
My wife is fine.	Mosali oa ka o ntse a phela hantle.
You do not think so.	Ha o nahane.
For me, my family and friends are everything.	Ho 'na, lelapa la ka le metsoalle ke ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
But then something happened to him.	Empa joale ho ile ha etsahala ntho e ’ngoe ho eena.
Of course, never do anything like this again.	Ha e le hantle, u se ke ua hlola u etsa ntho e kang ena hape.
But they do not care.	Empa ha ba tsotelle.
I think you did too.	Ke nahana hore le wena o entse jwalo.
Instead, share the good news with people.	Ho e-na le hoo, fa batho litaba tse monate.
What do they think they are doing?	Ba nahana hore ba etsa’ng?
Take it as we are.	E nke kamoo re leng kateng.
I was happy to be with him.	Ke ne ke thabetse ho ba le eena.
It did not take them long to arrest him.	Ha hoa ka ha ba nka nako e telele ho mo tšoara.
It becomes even stronger.	E ba matla le ho feta.
He has a son.	O na le mora.
But it gives him this idea.	Empa e mo fa mohopolo ona.
Save your stomach.	Boloka mpa ea hau.
Talk!	Bua!
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho etsa lintho.
He, the team.	Eena, sehlopha.
Some people get it, some don't get it.	Batho ba bang baa e fumana, ba bang ha ba e fumane.
Or he does.	Kapa o etsa joalo.
Parents need to be careful.	Batsoali ba lokelang ho hlokomela.
He knows it's his job here.	O a tseba hore ke mosebetsi wa hae mona.
He would never want to notice.	Le ka mohla o ne a ke ke a batla ho hlokomela.
I had to get out of there, and soon.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tloha moo, mme kapele.
I could see people liking it.	Ke ne ke bona batho ba e ratang.
He thought he would get out of it.	O ne a nahana hore o tla tsoa ho eona.
He would find that person.	O ne a tla fumana motho eo.
But we can live without them.	Empa re ka phela ntle le tsona.
So we started school.	Kahoo re ile ra qala sekolo.
I hear him say something.	Ke utloa a bua ho hong.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
It is not necessary, however.	Ha ho hlokahale, leha ho le joalo.
He was tired.	O ne a khathetse.
But we do know what happened in the past.	Empa re tseba se ileng sa etsahala nakong e fetileng.
Go out with friends.	Tsoa le metsoalle.
I have no sense for time, place.	Ha ke na kelello bakeng sa nako, sebaka.
He does not have to be.	Ha ho hlokahale hore a be joalo.
There is danger.	Ho na le kotsi .
But that did not matter.	Empa hoo ho ne ho se taba.
Not too many people know.	Ha se batho ba bangata haholo ba tsebang.
I knew he meant it.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o ne a e bolela.
Find out what you understand about it.	Fumana hore na u utloisisa eng ka eona.
He is not so important.	Ha a bohlokoa hakaalo.
I'm sorry to be late.	Ke masoabi ho fihla morao.
Hang hang.	Hang hang.
I went to my room.	Ke ile ka ea kamoreng ea ka.
Very good for me.	E ntle haholo ho nna.
If you like.	Haeba u rata.
And that should not be.	Mme seo ha sea lokela.
Besides, if they wanted us to know, they would have told us.	Ntle ho moo, haeba ba ne ba batla hore re tsebe, ba ka be ba re boleletse.
Never forget that.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua lebala seo.
Which, for me, is very bad often.	E leng, ho 'na, e mpe haholo hangata.
They walk out.	Ba tsamaea ba tsoa.
If there is a legal problem.	Haeba ho na le bothata ba molao.
This is my fault.	Ena ke phoso ea ka.
He drank his coffee and continued.	O ile a noa kofi eaba o tsoela pele.
He wanted it.	O ile a e batla.
That part of the day passes quickly.	Sebaka seo sa letsatsi se feta kapele.
They travel a lot there.	Ba tsamaea haholo moo.
I love you so much.	Ke u rata haholo.
Illegal.	Ka ntle ho molao.
I no longer wanted to drink him.	Ke ne ke se ke sa batle ho mo noa.
There is something in common.	Ho na le seo re tšoanang ka sona.
That's very nice.	Hoo ho monate haholo.
Or he will return.	Kapa o tla khutla.
They've been here a very long time.	Ba bile mona nako e telele haholo.
No, it does not matter to me in one way or another.	Che, ha ho na taba ho 'na ka tsela e 'ngoe kapa e 'ngoe.
This group has two.	Sehlopha sena se na le bobeli.
See how hard it was, to come here.	Le bone kamoo ho neng ho le boima kateng, ho tla mona.
I hope so.	Ke tšepa hore ho joalo.
But where he is today, he is a very good player.	Empa moo a leng teng kajeno, ke sebapali se hloahloa haholo.
i love it.	ke a e rata.
I have no idea how we felt at the time.	Ha ke tsebe hore na re ne re ikutloa joang ka nako eo.
As soon as he saw it, he knew it was important.	Hang ha a e bona, a tseba hore e bohlokoa.
It is very dangerous.	Ho kotsi haholo.
It was the best place we could be.	E ne e le sebaka se setle ka ho fetisisa seo re ka bang ho sona.
I took them.	Ke li nkile.
She started singing.	O ile a qala ho bina.
Spend time with some of them.	Qeta nako le ba bang ba bona.
And it is real.	'Me ke ntho ea sebele.
They are getting heavier.	Li ntse li e-ba boima.
Then he knew.	Joale o ne a tseba.
If you do not need them in the future.	Haeba u sa ba hloke nakong e tlang.
But we can know soon enough.	Empa re ka tseba haufinyane.
There is no other reason.	Haho lebaka le leng.
I try to start reading again.	Ke leka ho qala ho bala hape.
It was too old.	E ne e le khale haholo.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
I learn more every day.	Ke ithuta ho feta letsatsi le letsatsi.
I can't understand it.	Ha ke khone ho e utloisisa.
I finished one book and started another.	Ke ile ka qeta buka e ’ngoe eaba ke qala e ’ngoe.
He kept things simple.	O ne a boloka lintho li le bonolo.
I feel very good.	Ke ikutloa hantle haholo.
I say they do.	Ke re ba etsa joalo.
Alone.	A le mong.
They were the best.	E ne e le bona ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He is a good boy.	Ke moshanyana e motle.
To us it was here.	Ho rona e ne e le mona.
In place of the name is the sun.	Sebakeng sa lebitso ke letsatsi.
He read them carefully.	O ile a li bala ka hloko.
Or real people.	Kapa batho ba sebele.
Everything would work fine.	Tsohle li ne li tla sebetsa hantle.
None of his friends.	Ha ho le ea mong oa metsoalle ea hae.
Both were true.	Ka bobeli e ne e le 'nete.
With his family together, he went outside.	A e-na le lelapa la hae hammoho, o ile a tsoela ka ntle.
There is nothing we can do.	Haho seo re ka se etsang.
It could have been then or last night.	E ka be e bile ka nako eo kapa bosiung bo fetileng.
It's the past.	Ke tse fetileng.
However, you should consider the time and place.	Leha ho le joalo, u lokela ho nahana ka nako le sebaka.
I can't get to them.	Ha ke khone ho fihla ho bona.
So we started to do exactly that.	Kahoo re ile ra qala ho etsa joalo hantle.
I just wanted that weight for me.	Ke ne ke batla feela boima boo ho 'na.
You did not know.	Ha o a ka wa tseba.
Assume that everything will take longer than you think.	Nka hore tsohle li tla nka nako e telele ho feta kamoo u nahanang kateng.
We had never seen that before.	Re ne re eso bone seo.
Hi, do what you want.	Lumela, etsa seo u se batlang.
He tried to wait until his wife returned.	O ile a leka ho ema ho fihlela mosali oa hae a khutla.
Yes, yes, yes.	Ho joalo, e, ho joalo.
All the way.	Tsela eohle.
You may want to think about that.	U ka 'na ua batla ho nahana ka seo.
You can't be here without it.	U ke ke ua ba mona ntle le eona.
Some know this better than others.	Ba bang ba tseba sena ho feta ba bang.
Yes, love.	E, ho rata.
Doctor, help!	Ngaka, thusa!
We went to work.	Re ile ra ea mosebetsing.
He could talk to anyone.	O ne a ka bua le mang kapa mang.
I find this error.	Ke fumana phoso ena.
We were the last to leave.	Re bile ba ho qetela ho tsamaea.
Nothing else seemed to fit.	Ha ho letho le leng le neng le bonahala le lekana.
I loved working hard.	Ke ne ke rata ho sebetsa haholo.
When do we start?	Re qala neng?
Yet he could know.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a ka tseba.
It certainly is often for me.	Ka sebele hangata ke bakeng sa ka.
Then it will be a legal question.	Joale e tla ba potso ea molao.
It was hard to forget what had happened.	Ho ne ho le thata ho lebala se etsahetseng.
If so, it is likely that next year will be worse.	Haeba ho joalo, ho ka etsahala hore ebe selemong se tlang e tla ba tse mpe.
Just like mom and dad had a car, just fine.	Joalo ka ha 'm'e le ntate ba ne ba e-na le koloi, ho molemo feela.
He did not return.	Ha aa ka a khutla.
Both are ongoing.	Ka bobeli li ntse li tsoela pele.
Sometimes hard work tries to survive.	Ka linako tse ling ho sebetsa ka thata ho leka ho phela.
It was as if I were returning home.	E ne eka ke khutlela hae.
We have to buy a new car.	Re tlameha ho reka koloi e ncha.
He certainly did not think so.	Ka sebele o ne a sa nahane.
Every man is important.	Monna e mong le e mong o bohlokoa.
He was the one who left.	Ke eena ea ileng a tsamaea.
I've been here before!	Ke bile mona pele!
I'm going to it.	Ke ea ho eona.
I did not continue to ask this question.	Ha kea tsoela pele ho botsa potso ena.
This can do it.	Sena se ka e etsa.
That was good news for me.	Eo e ne e le litaba tse monate ho 'na.
The rest went.	Ba bang kaofela ba ile.
Unless someone has told him.	Ntle le haeba motho a mo boleletse.
I did nothing!	Ha kea etsa letho!
I looked at the money again.	Ke ile ka sheba chelete hape.
Her legs felt useless.	Maoto a hae a ne a ikutloa a se na thuso.
People come to the party every day.	Batho ba tla moketeng letsatsi le letsatsi.
It may make things easier for you to understand.	E ka 'na ea etsa hore lintho li be bonolo hore u li utloisise.
He is doing so now.	O etsa joalo hona joale.
Therefore, it takes a lot of time and hard work.	Ka hona, ho hlokahala nako e ngata le mosebetsi o boima.
I read his book.	Ke ile ka bala buka ea hae.
That has been true since we were children.	Ho bile joalo ho tloha re sa le bana.
This kind of writing was very difficult for him.	Mofuta ona oa ho ngola o ne o le boima haholo ho eena.
When does this group meet again? 	Sehlopha see se kopana neng hape?
we can't go.	ha re khone ho ea.
So think about what you want.	Kahoo nahana ka seo u se batlang.
There is a chance that he can win.	Ho na le monyetla oa hore a ka hlola.
It was nice to meet him.	Ho ne ho le monate hore ebe o ne a kopana le eena.
Better than us, it's better.	Ho feta rona, ho molemo.
I know how wonderful it is when they love you.	Kea tseba hore na ho monate hakae ha ba u rata.
Although we can find someone to.	Leha re ka fumana motho ho.
They said he was alone.	Ba re o ne a le mong.
It was not his place.	E ne e se sebaka sa hae.
I finished it.	Ke e qetile.
It finally arrived.	Qetellong ea fihla.
She did not know what to think of him.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a nahane eng ka eena.
I made a mistake.	Ke entse phoso.
What it has is a great pleasure.	Seo e nang le sona ke monate o moholo.
He applied for a job but was turned away.	O ile a kōpa mosebetsi empa ha aa ka a o fumana.
We do not have the money to buy food.	Ha re na le chelete ea ho reka lijo.
It really blends well.	E hlile e kopane hantle.
Any job.	Mosebetsi ofe kapa ofe.
You can do whatever you want.	O ka etsa eng kapa eng eo o e batlang.
Yeah, well, really.	E, o hantle, haholo.
I'm thinking of calling you.	Ke nahana ho o letsetsa.
For a long time.	Ka nako e telele.
I asked his name.	Ke ile ka botsa lebitso la hae.
We need to find it.	Re hloka ho e fumana.
Sometimes it takes several hours.	Ka linako tse ling ho nka lihora tse 'maloa.
I wonder how they can use the help.	Kea ipotsa hore na ba ka sebelisa thuso joang.
He learned nothing.	O ne a sa ithuta letho.
And everyone.	Le e mong le e mong.
However, they are all intertwined.	Leha ho le joalo, kaofela ha tsona li kopane.
I think he left because he wanted to go.	Ke nahana hore o ile a tsamaea hobane a ne a batla ho tsamaea.
He never talked about them.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka tsona.
I never thought he would think so.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore o tla nahana joalo.
You are an adult.	O motho e moholo.
He just loved being with people.	O ne a rata feela ho ba le batho.
Meeting you will not be good.	Ho kopana le uena ho ke ke ha e-ba molemo.
They both watched him as he entered.	Ka bobeli ba ile ba mo sheba ha a kena.
Get what you need.	Fumana seo u se hlokang.
But if he did.	Empa haeba a ile a etsa joalo .
Those things he could live.	Lintho tseo o ne a ka phela.
I do not know why it is not so but it is not.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hobaneng ho se joalo empa ha ho joalo.
He will be back soon.	O tla khutla haufinyane.
To know who.	Ho tseba mang.
We left him.	Re ile ra tloha ho eena.
But wait a minute.	Empa ema hanyane.
He could be as strong as he could not speak.	O ne a ka ba matla joalo ka ha a sa khone ho bua.
I did not tell anyone.	Ha kea ka ka bolella motho.
We will pretend we did not see it.	Re tla etsa eka ha rea ​​e bona.
For what, he was not sure.	Bakeng sa eng, o ne a se na bonnete.
They are the people who make it dangerous.	Ke batho ba etsang hore ho be kotsi.
Its value is significant.	Chelete ea eona e bohlokoa.
But he would do so.	Empa o ne a tla etsa joalo.
He will take care of you.	O tla o hlokomela.
We would not have read it if it had not been for that.	Re ne re ke ke ra e bala haeba ho ne ho se joalo.
However, not all of them were innocent.	Leha ho le joalo, hase bohle ba neng ba se na molato.
Then write it down.	Ebe u e ngola fatše.
You and I know that is not the case.	'Na le uena rea ​​tseba hore ha ho joalo.
It wouldn't be long now, he thought.	E ne e ka se be nako e telele jwale, a nahana.
He didn't want to see it.	O ne a sa batle ho e bona.
They did not look at him.	Ha baa ka ba mo sheba.
I can see it clearly.	Ke khona ho e bona hantle.
Everyone else mentions my husband.	Bohle ba bang ba bolela monna oa ka.
Then he does.	Ebe o etsa joalo.
They do not speak.	Ha ba bue.
It was just.	E ne e le feela.
It works very well just to be that way.	E sebetsa hantle haholo ho ba joalo feela.
All this time it was going on with me.	Ka nako ena eohle e ne e ntse e tsoela pele le 'na.
The children have a new teacher.	Bana ba na le tichere e ncha.
There were no police.	Ho ne ho se mapolesa.
See you tomorrow!.	Ke tla u bona hosane!.
Or something like that.	Kapa ntho e kang eo.
He finished it.	O ile a e qeta.
Something they would never do.	Ntho eo ba neng ba ke ke ba e etsa le ka mohla.
But there was nothing he could do.	Empa ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang.
I know how it is.	Kea tseba hore na ho joang.
Or anything for that matter.	Kapa ntho efe kapa efe bakeng sa taba eo.
Everything is everything, and it is everything.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe ke eona, 'me ke ntho e' ngoe le e 'ngoe.
People would notice.	Batho ba ne ba tla hlokomela.
The guilt was heavy at times.	Molato o ne o le boima ka linako tse ling.
It would have been too much, too soon.	E ka be e bile ngata haholo, kapele haholo.
He started to open the back door of the car.	A qala ho bula lemati le ka morao la koloi.
He opens the door, and out he goes.	O bula lemati, ’me oa tsoa.
People will not have problems with it.	Batho ba ke ke ba ba le mathata ka eona.
I know how you like to shop.	Kea tseba hore na u rata ho reka joang.
Not a problem.	Ha se bothata.
But one came out.	Empa e mong o ile a tsoa.
Make up your own mind.	Etsa maikutlo a hau.
However, it was good.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le molemo.
That's bad news.	Ke litaba tse mpe tseo.
But thank you for being with us this morning.	Empa re leboha ho ba le rona hoseng hona.
I feel this.	Ke utloa sena.
Or some other reason.	Kapa tse ling tsa lebaka.
I will never do it again.	Nke ke ka e etsa hape.
I do not want.	ha ke batle.
He realized his feelings for her.	O ile a hlokomela maikutlo a hae ho eena.
But really, that is not the job.	Empa ha e le hantle, hoo ha se mosebetsi.
That's him.	Ke eena.
It seemed kind.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ke mofuta.
If you did, you would pay.	Haeba u ne u ka etsa joalo, u ne u tla lefa.
I need to keep it.	Ke hloka ho e boloka.
She says she is happy.	O re o thabile.
He had heard his name.	O ne a utloile lebitso la hae.
There should be no reason for our pain.	Ha hoa lokela ho ba le lebaka la bohloko ba rona.
I believe it is better this way though.	Ke lumela hore ho molemo ka tsela ena leha ho le joalo.
I love it all, I love it.	Ke e rata kaofela, kea e rata.
He could not even speak.	O ne a sa khone le ho bua.
It was heavy.	E ne e le boima.
We didn't want any problems.	Re ne re sa batle mathata.
He is buying a car this week.	O reka koloi bekeng ena.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
She's just trying to be nice.	O mpa a leka ho ba motle.
However, they can be.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ka ba joalo.
He did not say much.	Ha a ka a bua haholo.
They did not expect him at all.	Ho hang ba ne ba sa mo lebella.
From there you can call your friends.	Ho tloha moo o ka letsetsa metsoalle ea hau.
From somewhere.	Ho tloha sebakeng se seng.
I thought he had it.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o na le eona.
I was the first person to hear the news.	Ke ’na motho oa pele ea ileng a utloa litaba tseo.
We would do it.	Re ne re tla e etsa.
I need help.	Ke hloka thuso.
He was a great guy to work with.	E ne e le mohlankana e moholo ho sebetsa.
I wanted to talk more.	Ke ne ke batla ho bua haholoanyane.
But getting closer to the ground became more of a problem.	Empa haufi le fatše e ile ea e-ba bothata haholoanyane.
He was never afraid of anything from me.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a tšaba letho ho tsoa ho 'na.
But they told us enough.	Empa ba ile ba re bolella ho lekaneng.
Or even if he had it.	Kapa le haeba a ne a e-na le eona.
If you want to be.	Haeba u batla ho ba.
We do not know for sure.	Ha re tsebe hantle.
I do not expect everyone to think as I do.	Ha kea lebella hore bohle ba nahane joaloka 'na.
He would come home.	O ne a tla fihla hae.
He was not thinking of others.	O ne a sa nahane ka tse ling.
It will come out.	E tla tsoa.
He is a boy!	Ke moshanyana!
To me, there are no friends.	Ho 'na, ha ho na metsoalle.
He was in so much pain that he could not stand up.	O ne a utloile bohloko hoo a neng a sitoa ho ema.
There are many of his.	Ho na le ba bangata ba hae.
Note that it takes.	Hlokomela hore ho nka.
You let things go even further.	U tlohela lintho le ho feta.
Because we have done nothing.	Hobane ha re so etse letho.
Everything about you is new.	Tsohle tse nang le uena ke ntho e ncha.
However, it was not that easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se bonolo hakaalo.
We just refuse.	Re mpa re hana.
But now it is old.	Empa joale ke ea khale.
He never told me who.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a mpolella mang.
Because of the book, often.	Ka lebaka la buka, hangata.
We did it on time.	Re e entse ka nako.
You have to look for it but it is there.	U tlameha ho e batla empa e teng.
There has never been anyone else.	Ha ho eso be le motho e mong.
But he did not want to.	Empa o ne a sa batle.
That is not the law.	Seo hase molao.
He needed to see the truth.	O ne a hloka ho bona ’nete.
I love both of them.	Ke rata bobeli ba bona.
A little tired.	Khathetse hanyane.
I returned to get help.	Ke ile ka khutla ho tla fumana thuso.
They know what they know.	Ba tseba seo ba se tsebang.
Forget the others.	Lebala tse ling.
He must study at home.	O tlameha ho ithuta hae.
It was a beautiful place.	E ne e le sebaka se setle.
Instead, he learned by mistake.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a ithuta ka phoso.
I will be there.	Ke tla ba teng.
I had a child with her.	Ke ne ke e-na le ngoana ka eena.
Check out my previous comments.	Sheba maikutlo a ka a fetileng.
Starting your career.	Ho qala mosebetsi oa hau.
It was to be a wonderful ceremony.	E ne e lokela ho ba mokete o makatsang.
The children loved it.	Bana ba ne ba e rata.
I too should have thought about it.	Le 'na ke ne ke lokela hore ebe ke ile ka nahana ka eona.
He was not good.	O ne a se molemo.
However, the police came.	Leha ho le joalo, mapolesa a ile a tla.
And he knew they would do it.	Mme o ne a tseba hore ba tla etsa jwalo.
I watched it happen.	Ke ile ka e shebella ha e etsahala.
However, otherwise it is still a past question.	Leha ho le joalo, ho seng joalo e ntse e le potso e fetileng.
He works very well.	O sebetsa hantle haholo.
Both in the same way.	Ka bobeli ka tsela e le 'ngoe.
The police eventually found the money.	Qetellong mapolesa a ile a fumana chelete eo.
Even more remarkable is the fact that the fourth man was traveling with them.	Ho makatsang le ho feta ke hore monna oa bone o ne a tsamaea le bona.
No, it is not.	Ha ho joalo, ha ho joalo.
However, of all the friends, he was the best.	Leha ho le joalo, ho metsoalle eohle e ne e le eena ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
This always happens when you arrive late.	Sena se etsahala kamehla ha u fihla ka mor'a nako.
Strange old thing that loved him so much.	Ntho e makatsang ea khale e neng e mo rata joalo.
I was reading and reading and reading.	Ke ne ke bala le ho bala le ho bala.
But mine too.	Empa le ea ka.
I think that's a good thing.	Ke nahana hore ke ntho e ntle.
But believing this does not make it true.	Empa ho lumela sena ha ho etse hore e be ’nete.
Soon, they decided where they were going and left.	Ho e-s’o ee kae, ba ile ba etsa qeto ea hore na ba ea hokae eaba ba tsamaea.
I'll tell you the truth here.	Ke tla bua 'nete le uena mona.
It's fun, and it's dangerous.	Ho monate, hape ho kotsi.
But I do not know them well enough.	Empa ka bona ha o ba tsebe hantle.
I will never make that mistake again.	Ha ke sa tla etsa phoso e jwalo hape.
He knew what his job was.	O ne a tseba hore na mosebetsi oa hae ke ofe.
And that's not a bad thing.	Mme seo ha se ntho e mpe.
They keep you going.	Ba u tsoela pele.
I have found my truth.	Ke fumane 'nete ea ka.
That's it, too.	Le tsona tseo, le hona.
His friends arrived shortly thereafter.	Metsoalle ea hae e ile ea fihla kapele ka mor'a moo.
We all have our best years.	Kaofela re na le lilemo tsa rona tse monate.
A picture of his father.	Setšoantšo sa ntate oa hae.
This is the first one.	Sena ke sa pele.
This school has problems.	Sekolo sena se na le mathata.
They seemed to be starting to get together.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ba qala ho kopana.
That would never have happened, never today.	Seo se ka be se sa etsahala, le ka mohla kajeno.
Use with caution.	Sebelisa ka hloko.
Do a few.	Etsa tse 'maloa.
Some people believe that he is alive.	Batho ba bang ba lumela hore o ntse a phela.
Your hair is still wet.	Moriri oa hau o ntse o le metsi.
She was beautiful.	O ne a le motle.
I moved in with her when my parents died.	Ke ile ka ea lula le eena ha batsoali ba ka ba hlokahala.
And that was strange.	Mme hoo e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
He was the only one who did not do so.	E ne e le eena feela ea sa kang a etsa joalo.
I have to go.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
It just starts.	E qala feela.
I hope you will like it all.	Ke tšepa hore le tla e rata kaofela.
But it really does not matter.	Empa ha e le hantle ha ho na taba.
Then you will see.	Joale u tla bona.
Early in the morning.	E sa le hoseng.
I haven't given you enough information.	Ha kea u fa litaba tse lekaneng.
He opened the heavy door.	A bula lemati le boima.
There is no question of such things here.	Ha ho na potso ea lintho tse joalo mona.
Simple but effective.	E bonolo empa e sebetsa.
Because we didn't start this, we finished this.	Hobane ha rea ​​qala sena, re qetile sena.
This room is empty.	Kamore ena ha e na letho.
I only knew the man.	Ke ne ke tseba monna eo feela.
Come into me.	Kena ka ho nna.
They are not.	Ha ba joalo.
The power of this.	Matla a matla ka ena.
Start planning now.	Qala ho rera hona joale.
I knew him well.	Ke ne ke mo tseba hantle.
Moreover, they work.	Ho feta moo, ba sebetsa.
I did what he said.	Ke entse seo a se buileng.
He didn't think so much.	O ne a sa nahane joalo haholo.
Because that's the way he was.	Hobane ke kamoo a neng a le kateng.
Of course, all these things are important.	Ke ’nete hore lintho tsena kaofela ke tsa bohlokoa.
Maybe it can be good for others as well.	Mohlomong e ka ba molemo le ho ba bang.
I know how you feel right now.	Kea tseba hore na u ikutloa joang hona joale.
He was expecting trouble.	O ne a lebeletse bothata.
He was very close to them.	O ne a le haufi haholo le bona.
It did not seem real.	E ne e sa bonahale e le ntho ea sebele.
It will not work.	E ke ke ea sebetsa.
Perhaps he was caught in the sun.	Mohlomong o ile a tšoaroa ke letsatsi.
What? 	Joale?
Nice to see you again.	Ke thabela ho o bona hape.
I know there are many things I need to learn.	Kea tseba hore ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo ke lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
I think that is ridiculous.	Ke nahana hore ke ntho e hlokang kelello.
He did not know that.	O ne a sa tsebe seo.
It was a good time to think.	E ne e le nako e ntle ea ho nahana.
I would appreciate any help.	Ke tla leboha thuso efe kapa efe.
There is nothing more to this.	Ha ho letho le leng hape ho sena.
I have many more, if you would like to see them sometime.	Ke na le tse ling tse ngata, ha u ka rata ho li bona ka nako e 'ngoe.
We did it once.	Re e entse hang.
And he is here with us.	Mme o teng le rona mona.
I am sure I will try it.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ke tla e leka.
He knew he was guilty, everyone knew.	O ne a tseba hore o molato, bohle ba ne ba tseba.
Time passed quickly.	Nako e ile ea feta kapele.
Yes, and thank you.	E, 'me kea u leboha.
They do not need to think about it.	Ha ho hlokahale hore ba nahane ka eona.
They already know where we are.	Ba se ba tseba moo re leng teng.
I like things.	Ke rata lintho.
I see them.	Ke oa bona.
No one was supposed to be the last.	Ha ho motho ea neng a lokela ho ba ho ea ho qetela.
I think it doesn't matter.	Ke nahana hore ha ho na taba.
I would love to learn about her in her mother's presence.	Ke ne ke tla thabela ho ithuta ka eena 'mè oa hae a le teng.
They would certainly return when he returned.	Ka sebele ba ne ba tla khutla ha a khutla.
If not, the fault lies with me.	Haeba ho se joalo, phoso e tla be e le ea ka.
Children learn to read and write at school.	Bana ba ithuta ho bala le ho ngola sekolong.
But they did not find them all.	Empa ha ba ka ba fumana bohle.
It just happened.	Ke ntho feela e etsahetseng.
Leave things as they are.	Tlohela lintho kamoo li leng kateng.
We cannot talk about such things.	Re ke ke ra bua ka lintho tse joalo.
I will not talk to you tomorrow.	Ha ke sa tla bua le uena hosane.
The hair is so beautiful.	Moriri o motle joalo.
I had nothing in my name.	Ke ne ke se na letho ka lebitso la ka.
Only one of them seemed happy.	Ke a le mong feela oa bona ea neng a bonahala a thabile.
I did not say we would do that.	Ha kea ka ka re re tla etsa joalo.
What are you waiting for ?.	O emetse eng?.
This was it, this was his great opportunity.	Sena e ne e le sona, ona e ne e le monyetla oa hae o moholo.
It would not be beautiful.	E ne e sa tlo ba ntle.
There is your danger.	Ho na le kotsi ea hau.
That gives our reason strength.	Seo se fa lebaka la rona matla.
I was the first to go to it.	Ke ne ke qala ho ea ho eona.
The phone rings.	Mohala oa lla.
It was really fun.	E ne e le monate ruri.
But we must.	Empa re tlameha.
Are you with us?	O na le rona?
Yes, everything is real.	E, ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ke ea sebele.
Maybe again.	Mohlomong hape.
We are not what we used to be.	Ha re seo re neng re le sona.
There will be one last time, one last chance.	Ho tla ba le nako ya ho qetela, monyetla wa ho qetela.
I do that a lot.	Ke etsa joalo haholo.
If it is too wet it will not survive.	Ha e le metsi haholo e ke ke ea phela.
Maybe your job is harder than most people think.	Mohlomong mosebetsi oa hau o boima ho feta kamoo batho ba bangata ba nahanang kateng.
He does the work in you.	O etsa mosebetsi ka ho wena.
But he never did.	Empa ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo.
You would, of course.	U ne u tla, ka sebele.
I will try again next year.	Ke tla leka hape selemong se tlang.
They did not find it.	Ha ba a ka ba e fumana.
Of course, it can be very easy.	Ha e le hantle, ho ka ba bonolo haholo.
She often enjoys her food.	Hangata o thabela lijo tsa hae.
Just sleep there.	Robala moo feela.
I love us together.	Ke re rata hammoho.
Any of those things are not.	Leha e le efe ea lintho tseo ha e joalo.
All.	Bohle.
He should not see that we are here.	Ha a lokela ho bona hore re mona.
But he did not see it.	Empa ha a ka a e bona.
I want to offer some help.	Ke batla ho fana ka thuso.
One young man tried to make a decision.	Mohlankana e mong o ile a leka ho etsa qeto.
It gives them the power to be better.	Ho ba fa matla a ho ba betere.
According to his mother, he does this sometimes.	Ho ea ka 'mè oa hae, o ntse a etsa sena ka linako tse ling.
I thought quickly.	Ke ile ka nahana kapele.
I did not understand why no one was doing it.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha ho se motho ea e etsang.
It is a very high power.	Ke matla a phahameng haholo.
I hope you enjoy it !.	Kea tšepa u tla e thabela!.
He counted the money carefully.	O ile a bala chelete ka hloko.
If they are, we can find out where we are.	Haeba li teng, re ka fumana hore na re hokae.
And stand with.	Le ho ema le.
The baby was fine.	Ngoana o ne a le hantle.
There was nothing here.	Mona ho ne ho se letho.
This was certainly not fun.	Ka sebele sena se ne se se monate.
The easiest way to understand this is through a door.	Tsela e bonolo ea ho utloisisa sena ke ka lemati.
I'm thinking of you, too.	Ke ntse ke nahana ka wena, le nna.
The latter is easy to understand.	Ea ho qetela e bonolo ho e utloisisa.
The room was not only empty, but empty.	Kamore e ne e se feela e se nang letho, empa e ne e se na letho.
Or they should.	Kapa ba lokela.
Talk about what we love.	Ho bua ka seo re se ratang.
Here is another way to do it.	Tsela e 'ngoe ea ho e etsa ke ena.
I think it will be so.	Ke nahana hore ho tla ba joalo.
That works very, very well.	Seo se sebetsa haholo, hantle haholo.
he asked.	a botsa.
And maybe it's just an opportunity.	Mme mohlomong ke monyetla feela.
This was an exit call, after all.	Ona e ne e le mohala oa ho tsoa, ​​ka mor'a tsohle.
it is a force.	ke matla.
I was waiting for it.	Ke ne ke e emetse.
For his people.	Bakeng sa batho ba hae.
Then go ahead.	Joale tsoela pele.
I could not know it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e tseba.
You just don't know.	Ha o tsebe feela.
So, these are very good.	Kahoo, tsena li ntle haholo.
He lives next to her.	O lula haufi le eena.
That’s something you have to hear.	Ke ntho eo u lokelang ho e utloa.
He would wait another week, deciding.	O ne a tla ema beke e 'ngoe, a etsa qeto.
Maybe he should find a place to sleep, he thought.	Mohlomong o lokela ho fumana sebaka sa ho robala, o ile a nahana.
I did not look at him properly.	Ha kea ka ka mo sheba hantle.
Thank you very much.	Ke leboha haholo.
I'd like to make friends.	Ke kopa ho etsa metsoalle.
That's how he got the money.	Ke kamoo a ileng a fumana chelete kateng.
He really goes for everything or nothing.	Ehlile o ea tsohle kapa ha ho letho.
It's one of mine.	Ke e 'ngoe ea ka.
It is not.	Ha se eona.
And if my father had his way, he still wouldn't do it.	Mme hoja ntate a ne a ena le tsela ya hae, o ne a ntse a ke ke a etsa jwalo.
I wish for some reason.	Ke lakatsa ka lebaka le itseng.
The field is very strong.	Lebala le matla haholo.
He does not like it.	Ha a rate.
Get out! 	Tsoa!
One of them called him this morning.	E mong wa bona o ile a mo letsetsa hoseng hona.
Maybe it was his hair.	Mohlomong e ne e le moriri oa hae.
But he likes it there.	Empa o rata moo.
This is a great opportunity for us.	Sena ke monyetla o moholo ho rona.
She is more beautiful than that.	O motle ho feta moo.
That is, in my opinion, it is not.	Ke hore, ka maikutlo a ka, ha ho joalo.
In this way.	Ka mokhoa ona.
It still looks good.	E ntse e shebahala hantle.
He must stay.	A tlameha ho lula.
You know about my real parents.	Ua tseba ka batsoali ba ka ba sebele.
However, he often walks.	Leha ho le joalo, hangata o tsamaea ka maoto.
The baby started to cry.	Ngoana a qala ho lla.
Obviously this will take time.	Ho hlakile hore sena se tla nka nako.
I do not know what can happen.	Ha ke tsebe se ka etsahalang.
Now, there are those like my husband who love both.	Joale, ho na le ba kang monna oa ka ba ratang ka bobeli.
I'm not sure why.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng ha ho le joalo.
But he had to give her another chance.	Empa o ile a tlameha ho mo fa monyetla o mong.
The police work very well.	Mapolesa a sebetsa hantle haholo.
It was clear he was tired.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore o khathetse.
We have not met for a long time.	E se e le nako e telele re sa kopane.
She thought of her children.	A nahana ka bana ba hae.
But in doing so, he set the pattern for others.	Empa ka ho etsa joalo, o ile a etsetsa ba bang mokhoa.
It is not real life.	Ha se bophelo ba sebele.
Last week, something terrible happened.	Bekeng e fetileng, ho ile ha etsahala ntho e mpe ruri.
They make a lot of money.	Ba etsa chelete e ngata haholo.
But you are still second.	Empa u ntse u le oa bobeli.
It will be fun.	Ho tla ba monate.
This was work.	Ona e ne e le mosebetsi.
I loved the place when I saw it.	Ke ile ka rata sebaka seo ha ke se bona.
He wanted to know what it was.	O ne a batla ho tseba hore na ke eng.
Earn money, now.	Fumana chelete, joale.
Moreover, they would not do so.	Ho feta moo, ba ne ba ke ke ba etsa joalo.
But you usually do not have the time to do this.	Empa hangata ha u na nako ea ho etsa sena.
However you may like.	Leha ho le joalo u ka rata.
He loved the life he had, and he knew it well.	O ne a rata bophelo boo a neng a e-na le bona, ’me a bo tseba hantle.
Like everything about this place.	Joalo ka tsohle ka sebaka sena.
I needed water.	Ke ne ke hloka metsi.
But it should use only one method.	Empa e lokela ho sebelisa mokhoa o le mong feela.
He is very strong.	O matla haholo.
I have too many.	Ke na le tse ngata haholo.
She did not know if her husband would return.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na monna oa hae o tla khutla.
Everyone has today.	Motho e mong le e mong o na le kajeno.
But now was not the time.	Empa joale e ne e se nako.
I could feel it.	Ke ne ke utloa.
And the second one will be fun.	'Me ea bobeli e tla ba monate.
He needed help to get around.	O ne a hloka thuso ea ho tsamaea.
It was all mine.	E ne e le tsohle tsa ka.
I don't know what's wrong with it.	Ha ke tsebe hore na molato ke eng ka eona.
That it can be anyone he wants to be.	Hore e ka ba mang kapa mang eo a batlang ho ba eena.
Sometimes it is.	Ka linako tse ling ho joalo.
He thought he should not do that.	O ile a nahana hore ha aa lokela ho etsa joalo.
My mother was just giving her opinion.	'Mè o ne a fana ka maikutlo a hae feela.
He looked his way.	A sheba tsela ya hae.
Maybe it will be enough.	Mohlomong ho tla lekana.
Then came a.	Eaba ho tla a.
Do not do this.	O seke wa etsa ntho ena.
We enjoyed living here.	Re ile ra thabela ho lula mona.
For the same reason.	Ka lebaka le tšoanang.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
Good thing !.	Ntho e ntle!.
They will find you.	Ba tla o fumana.
However, the task was much easier than it was.	Leha ho le joalo, mosebetsi o ne o le bonolo ho feta ho o etsa.
What it is and what it does.	Seo e leng sona le seo e se etsang.
He understood her well.	O ne a mo utloisisa hantle.
I do not understand how this could be.	Ha ke utloisise hore na sena se ka ba joang.
They can see such things.	Ba ka bona lintho tse joalo.
However, finding them was difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, ho li fumana ho ile ha e-ba thata.
One of us is coming.	E mong oa rona o tla.
They could do what they wanted.	Ba ne ba ka etsa seo ba se batlang.
Or they can.	Kapa ba ka khona.
If you never talked about it, it was gone.	Haeba ha ho mohla u kileng ua bua ka eona, e ne e le sieo.
I would not be able to do it.	Ke ne nke ke ka khona ho e etsa.
I am very happy, yes.	Ke thabile haholo, e.
If that works.	Haeba seo se sebetsa.
But he refused to cry.	Empa o ne a hana ho lla.
He enjoys having what he does.	O thabela ho ba le seo a se etsang.
Such a thing belongs to others.	Ntho e joalo ke ea batho ba bang.
It may have been.	E ka 'na eaba ho bile joalo.
I'll take you with me, too.	Ke tla o nka le nna, haholo.
I enjoy his work.	Ke thabela mosebetsi oa hae.
You want to be human.	U batla ho ba motho.
But who needs it.	Empa ke mang ea e hlokang.
Find that girl.	Fumana ngoanana eo.
Find out all the other things.	Fumana lintho tse ling kaofela.
The truth was waiting.	'Nete e ne e ntse e emetse.
Just trying to get out.	Ho leka ho tsoa feela.
Everything has its time and place.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le nako ea eona le sebaka sa eona.
We have had this several times.	Re bile le sena ka makhetlo a 'maloa.
He is very simple.	O bonolo haholo.
I know you're going through the motions.	Kea tseba hore u ntse u tsoela pele ka litaba.
Now it hurts to do both.	Hona joale ho bohloko ho li etsa ka bobeli.
That's the way it is.	Ke kamoo ho leng kateng.
There was a serious accident yesterday	Ho bile le kotsi e mpe maobane
It has been good for you to come.	Ho bile molemo ho uena ho tla.
That's when his family decided to leave him.	Ke ha lelapa la hae le ile la etsa qeto ea ho e tlohela.
But only if it can happen.	Empa feela haeba ho ka etsahala.
I drink a lot of coffee.	Ke noa kofi e ngata haholo.
I had never seen anything better than that.	Ke ne ke e-s'o bone ntho leha e le efe e ntle ho feta eo.
She has found some, but she does not tell anyone.	O fumane tse ling, empa ha a bolelle motho.
It works.	E ea sebetsa.
It still looks good.	E ntse e shebahala e le ntle.
We entered.	Ra kena.
I did not tell anyone.	Ha kea ka ka bolella mang kapa mang letho.
We can help !.	Re ka thusa!.
I need to hear it.	Ke hloka ho e utloa.
Anything we wanted.	Eng kapa eng eo re neng re e batla.
I've been there, done that, thank you.	Ke bile moo, ke entse seo, kea leboha.
I think about him every day.	Ke nahana ka eena letsatsi le letsatsi.
Everything that comes first is here.	Sohle se tlang pele se mona.
I could not sleep.	Ha kea khona ho robala.
You do not know what to do.	Ha o tsebe hore na o tla etsa eng.
He obviously did not know where he was.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a sa tsebe moo a leng teng.
For one, he does well in what he does.	E 'ngoe, o sebetsa hantle ho seo a se etsang.
Of course we were happy with the work that was available.	Ehlile re ne re thabetse mosebetsi o neng o le teng.
You cannot do both.	U ke ke ua li etsa ka bobeli.
Everyone knows what to do.	E mong le e mong o tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
Nice to see you.	Ke thabela ho o bona.
But he knows who did it.	Empa oa tseba hore na ke mang ea entseng joalo.
They are not.	Ha ba eo.
He would stay with her.	O ne a tla lula le eena.
Being alone is very good.	Ho ba mong ho molemo haholo.
And there was a reason for that.	Mme ho ne ho ena le lebaka la seo.
Our team was in second place.	Sehlopha sa rona se ne se le sebakeng sa bobeli.
Look, don't say nothing.	Sheba, o seke wa bua letho.
It's heavy.	E boima.
It looks like a wonderful book.	E shebahala joaloka buka e monate joalo.
In fact, it is much easier to see now than ever before.	Ha e le hantle, ho bonolo haholo ho bona hona joale ho feta pele.
Nobody does that.	Haho motho ya etsang seo.
It is easy to see that.	Ho bonolo ho bona seo.
They both felt guilty.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba ikutloa ba le molato.
I've been here a very long time.	Ke bile mona nako e telele haholo.
Perhaps he does not believe that the book is the truth.	Mohlomong ha a lumele hore taba ea libuka ke ea 'nete.
I just stood there.	Ke ile ka ema feela.
That's where it was at.	Ke hona moo e neng e le teng.
Second you have to ask often.	Ea bobeli u tlameha ho botsa hangata.
I'm not sure why.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore na hobaneng ho le joalo.
But we can not.	Empa re ka se khone le.
Probably just a few.	Mohlomong ke tse 'maloa feela.
We ate delicious food.	Re ile ra ja lijo tse monate.
It really doesn't matter.	Ehlile ha se taba.
Now, we must find a way.	Jwale, re lokela ho fumana tsela.
They knew more than to doubt now.	Ba ne ba tseba ho feta ho belaela hona joale.
It's not that fun.	Ha se ntho e monate hakaalo.
We do not.	Ha re etse joalo.
He wanted to quit his job.	O ne a batla ho tlohela mosebetsi oa hae.
You tell us about yourself.	U re bolella ka uena.
I don't care if you go with them.	Ha ke na taba ea hore u tsamaee le bona.
Do not overeat.	U se ke ua ja haholo.
So here we are.	Kahoo ke rona bana.
The latter.	Ea bobeli.
Notice, the ground is wet.	Hlokomela, fatše ke metsi.
I was not eating.	Ke ne ke sa je.
There are so many things going on in it.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang ho eona.
It was a possibility, though it was not a possibility.	E ne e le ntho e ka etsahalang, le hoja e ne e se ntho e ka etsahalang.
I love how hard it is.	Ke rata kamoo ho leng thata kateng.
But no one else did.	Empa ha ho motho e mong ea ileng a etsa joalo.
He will conquer it.	O tla e hlola.
Indeed, he wished he could go.	Ka sebele, o ne a lakatsa eka a ka tsamaea.
It benefits you every day.	E u tsoela molemo letsatsi le leng le le leng.
But they were not.	Empa ba ne ba le sieo.
Some are bad, some are good.	Tse ling li mpe, tse ling li ntle.
He never had a problem finding what he was looking for.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba le bothata ba ho fumana lintho tseo a li batlang.
Maybe they should.	Mohlomong ba lokela.
We were glad to hear it.	Re ile ra thabela ho e utloa.
Just always in everything there.	Kamehla feela ho tsohle moo.
That is none of my business.	Seo ha se taba ea ka.
But they are not the same type.	Empa ha se mofuta o le mong.
That happened many times.	Seo se ile sa etsahala hangata.
The problem with all of this is time.	Bothata ba tsena tsohle ke nako.
I think you understand it.	Ke nahana hore u e utloisisa.
I can't think straight.	Ha ke khone ho nahana hantle.
He looked quickly behind him.	A sheba kapele ka morao.
It gives way.	E fana ka tsela.
I have a lot of things to do.	Ke na le lintho tse ngata tseo ke lokelang ho li etsa.
But she may love it.	Empa a ka nna a e rata.
I do not earn much money.	Ha ke fumane chelete e ngata.
We were friends.	Re ne re le metsoalle.
I was saying something, he was saying something.	Ke ne ke bua ho hong, o ne a bua ho hong.
In the room.	Ka kamoreng.
Most people just pass by.	Batho ba bangata ba feta feela.
How can he be so stupid? 	Ho tla joang hore ebe motho ea hlokang kelello hakaalo?
the boy wondered.	moshanyana a ipotsa.
I work very well on my own.	Ke sebetsa hantle haholo ke le mong.
No one believed him.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo lumela.
It is the same situation here.	Ke boemo bo tšoanang le mona.
The law says that.	Molao o bolela seo.
I will definitely use this when it feels better.	Ka sebele ke tla sebelisa sena ha se ikutloa se le betere.
I hope it will happen.	Ke tšepa hore e tla etsahala.
It is easy to see why people love him.	Ho bonolo ho utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha batho ba mo rata.
I really couldn’t go any further than it was hard.	Ke hlile ke sitoa ho feta kamoo e neng e le thata kateng.
Who knows.	Ke mang ea tsebang.
Some came out.	Ba bang ba ile ba tsoa.
Hi! 	Lumela!
You probably did not know that.	Mohlomong u ne u sa tsebe seo.
That's him.	Ke eena.
But they were there.	Empa ba ne ba le teng.
But she did not cry.	Empa ha a ka a lla.
It’s a lot of books all the time.	Ke libuka tse ngata ka linako tsohle.
I wanted your time a little bit.	Ke ne ke batla nako ea hau hanyane.
I feel the same way.	Ke ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
I had to move on.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tsoela pele.
We finally found it easy to just walk away.	Qetellong re ile ra fumana ho le bonolo ho tsamaea feela.
I'll check it out tomorrow.	Ke tla e sheba hosane.
It was an old job for them.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa khale ho bona.
It was as if we were not there.	E ne eka ha re eo le moo.
It was nighttime.	Ka nako eo e ne e le bosiu.
A group may have only one type.	Sehlopha se ka ba le mofuta o le mong feela.
I have not found a reason for this.	Ha kea fumana lebaka la sena.
Yet he did not even know his name.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a sa tsebe le lebitso la hae.
Everyone knows that is impossible.	E mong le e mong oa tseba hore seo se ke ke sa etsahala.
I did that.	Ke entse seo.
Do not trust them.	Le se ke la ba tšepa.
He tries it.	O a o leka.
We are here for the same reason, that is very clear.	Re mona ka lebaka le tšoanang, hoo ho hlakile haholo.
Then she cried.	Eaba o lla.
She reads only three books at a time.	O bala libuka tse tharo feela ka nako.
Nor for work.	Leha e le bakeng sa mosebetsi.
Simple but very good.	E bonolo empa e ntle haholo.
I hope this will give you some ideas.	Kea tšepa hore sena se tla u fa maikutlo a mang.
The whole thing may have been wrong.	E ka 'na eaba taba eohle e bile phoso.
It was his job.	E ne e le mosebetsi wa hae.
They were arrested.	Ba ile ba tšoaroa.
And this is not a good thing.	Mme sena ha se ntho e ntle.
Nothing like this has ever existed, nor could it ever exist.	Ha ho ntho e kang ena e kileng ea phela, leha e le hore e ne e ke ke ea phela.
It just so happened.	Ho bile jwalo feela.
I don't even want to do that.	Ha ke batle le ho etsa joalo.
Everyone loves her.	E mong le e mong oa mo rata.
I'm not talking anymore.	Ha ke sa bua.
The first three days take only three days.	Matsatsi a mararo a pele a nka matsatsi a mararo feela.
That, too, can work.	Seo, le sona, se ka sebetsa.
Did they travel together?	Na ba ne ba tsamaea hammoho?
I did not finish the last one.	Ha kea qeta ea ho qetela.
If you think.	Haeba u nahana.
He has a team.	O na le sehlopha.
You will probably forget that something exists.	Mohlomong u tla lebala hore ntho e teng.
But it is still not true yet.	Empa e ntse e se 'nete leha ho le joalo.
If you have ever heard it, you have heard it many times.	Haeba u kile ua e utloa hang, u e utloile hangata haholo.
Of course, no.	Ha e le hantle, che.
But don't tell me what to eat.	Empa u se ke ua mpolella hore na ke je eng.
But this is not the whole picture.	Empa sena ha se setšoantšo sohle.
They really don't like it.	Ehlile ha ba e rate.
There must be something wrong.	E tlameha ebe ho na le phoso.
Maybe something will happen tonight.	Mohlomong ntho e 'ngoe e tla etsahala bosiung bona.
I discovered her interests and read books about her.	Ke ne ke fumana lintho tseo a li ratang ebe ke bala libuka tse buang ka tsona.
He had done his job.	O ne a entse mosebetsi wa hae.
We feel we can be better than we used to be.	Re ikutloa re ka ba betere ho feta kamoo re neng re le kateng.
Everyone must do their part.	E mong le e mong o tlameha ho etsa mosebetsi oa hae.
People learned a lot.	Batho ba ile ba ithuta lintho tse ngata.
I understood why.	Ke ile ka utloisisa lebaka.
I started to feel worse.	Ke ile ka qala ho utloa bohloko le ho feta.
I thought it was very good.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e ntle haholo.
I just see.	Ke bona feela.
After that, they can do whatever they want.	Ka mor’a moo, ba ka etsa seo ba se batlang.
Except from me.	Ntle le ho tsoa ho 'na.
You keep saying no.	U ntse u re che.
He could.	O ne a khona.
They knew they would find food here.	Ba ne ba tseba hore ba tla fumana lijo mona.
He was so tired that he could not sleep for a week.	O ne a khathetse hoo a neng a khona ho robala beke kaofela.
This is what we both want.	Sena ke seo re se batlang ka bobeli.
I didn't get into that.	Ha kea kena ho seo.
No one helped her with homework.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo thusa ka mosebetsi oa sekolo.
That is my decision.	Ke qeto ea ka.
Nobody does that.	Ha ho motho ea etsang joalo.
I even needed him.	Ke ne ke bile ke mo hloka.
The law is very important.	Molao oa bohlokoa haholo.
It was not difficult to do so.	Ho ne ho se thata ho etsa joalo.
he asked.	a botsa.
So many people.	Batho ba bangata hakana.
I just stop for a moment.	Ke mpa ke re ema hanyane.
You know, an adult is better.	O ya tseba, motho e moholo o betere.
That's what man does.	Ke seo motho a se etsang.
However, he did not drive, which is strange.	Leha ho le joalo, ha aa ka a khanna, e leng ntho e makatsang.
It is up to the individual.	Ho ho motho ka mong.
Then they start going out and buying in advance.	Ebe ba qala ho tsoa le ho reka esale pele.
It was the law.	E ne e le molao.
And last year.	Le selemong se fetileng.
That's where the other people were.	Ke moo batho ba bang ba neng ba le teng.
That starts with me.	Seo se qala ka nna.
I would have to help.	Ke ne ke tla tlameha ho thusa.
We had no reason.	Ha rea ​​ka ra ba le lebaka.
Make this life better.	Etsa hore bophelo bona bo be betere.
He doesn't see that.	Ha a bone seo.
He valued every letter.	O ne a nka lengolo le leng le le leng e le ntho ea bohlokoa.
I can fit.	Ke khona ho lekana.
I did not sleep well last night.	Ha kea robala hantle bosiung bo fetileng.
Something good and powerful is happening.	Ho etsahala ntho e ntle le e matla.
That was the situation my father needed to get to, he told me.	Ke boemo boo Ntate a neng a hloka ho fihla ho bona, o ile a mpolella.
I've seen a lot.	Ke bone haholo.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
The last one is missing.	Ea ho qetela ha e eo.
The first is space.	Ea pele ke sebaka.
That was supposed to be fun.	Seo se ne se lokela ho ba monate.
I'm very good at that.	Ke hantle haholo ho seo.
It worked very well.	E ile ea sebetsa hantle haholo.
We had never heard anything like this before.	Re ne re qala ho utloa ntho e kang ena.
However, these are all difficult questions.	Leha ho le joalo, tsena kaofela ke lipotso tse thata.
This is a new house.	Ena ke ntlo e ncha.
Or something like that.	Kapa ntho e joalo.
However, there was something he had to do here first.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le seo a neng a lokela ho se etsa mona pele.
That woman was never important to me or my father.	Ha ho mohla mosali eo a kileng a ba bohlokoa ho 'na kapa ho ntate oa ka.
I've seen it.	Ke re bone.
I'm used to them.	Ke ba tloaetse.
I am a player.	Ke sebapali.
So he could tell everyone else.	Kahoo o ne a ka bolella ba bang kaofela.
So you keep playing with it.	Kahoo u tsoela pele ho bapala ka eona.
She cried.	O ile a lla.
It just had to happen.	E ne e tlameha ho etsahala feela.
You're working again.	U ntse u sebetsa hape.
Take what you can, while you can get it.	Nka seo u ka se khonang, ha u ntse u ka se fumana.
I tried to figure out what was wrong.	Ke ile ka leka ho fumana hore na phoso ke efe.
But it is better not to do that.	Empa ho molemo hore a se ke a etsa joalo.
We will not talk about it.	Ha re na ho bua ka eona.
I go outside to look at a few things.	Ke tsoela ka ntle ho sheba lintho tse 'maloa.
I am experiencing a problem today.	Ke kopana le bothata kajeno.
By doing this.	Ka ho etsa sena.
It makes no sense to give a man what he expected.	Ha ho na kelello ho fa monna seo a neng a se lebeletse.
The food is delicious.	Lijo li monate.
See how long it takes.	Bona hore na ho nka nako e kae.
It was all he would need.	E ne e le sohle seo a neng a tla se hloka.
Or you just finished.	Kapa o qeta ho qeta.
They don't want me to go alone.	Ha ba batle hore ke tsamaee ke le mong.
I can't do more.	Ha ke khone ho etsa ho feta.
That's much better.	Seo se betere haholo.
He did not come to her.	Ha aa ka a tla ho eena.
I had no idea what he was doing.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe seo a se etsang.
I thought we could go second.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re ka ea bobeli.
I just say everything works for a reason.	Ke mpa ke re ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e sebetsa ka lebaka.
Also, the real things of life here.	Hape, lintho tsa sebele tsa bophelo mona.
He had seen how they could be human.	O ne a bone kamoo ba ka bang batho kateng.
No, thank you for your time.	Che, kea leboha ka nako ea hau.
So he drives my car.	Kahoo o khanna koloi ea ka.
That had happened before.	Seo se ne se kile sa etsahala.
He lives here every day working.	O lula mona letsatsi le letsatsi a sebetsa.
Good thing.	Ntho e ntle.
He refused to give up.	O ne a hana ho e tlohela.
Look down.	Sheba fatše.
I wondered if you knew in any way.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na u tseba ka tsela e itseng.
And they did well, it was fun to watch.	'Me ba entse hantle, ho ne ho le monate ho shebella.
I have to start walking further.	Ke tlameha ho qala ho tsamaea ho feta.
They agreed to meet somewhere.	Ba ile ba lumela ho kopana sebakeng se itseng.
Do this carefully.	Etsa sena ka hloko.
I think only of the child.	Ke nahana ka ngoana feela.
I just don't understand.	Ke mpa ke sa utloisise.
It was the same with me.	Ho bile joalo le ho 'na.
Let him think.	E re a nahane.
He is not the danger here.	Ha se eena ea kotsi mona.
Look at this issue.	Sheba taba ena.
It was so good.	Ho ne ho le molemo hakaalo.
It is neither good nor bad.	Ha e ntle kapa e mpe.
I know it has me.	Kea tseba hore e na le 'na.
It had never done that before.	E ne e e-s'o ka e etsa joalo pele.
We had no breakfast.	Re ne re sa ja lijo tsa hoseng.
It was very difficult.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo.
I have to do that, too.	Ke lokela ho etsa seo, le nna.
he will say.	o tla re.
I did not do that.	Ha kea ka ka etsa joalo.
We wanted to be with you.	Re ne re batla ho ba le uena.
He refused to admit any wrongdoing.	O ile a hana ho lumela phoso leha e le efe.
I came to him.	Ke ile ka tla ho eena.
Something else here.	Ho hong hape mona.
He thought that was a good idea.	O ne a nahana hore oo ke mokhoa o motle.
That is true.	Seo ke 'nete.
Surely they can.	Ka sebele ba ka khona.
You can use the money to buy a house.	U ka sebelisa chelete ho reka ntlo.
It is dangerous to sit down.	Ho kotsi ho lula fatše.
But he did not do that.	Empa ha a ka a etsa seo.
Do you think you will come again next year?	Na u nahana hore u tla tla hape selemong se tlang?
They may know better than we do.	E ka ’na eaba ba tseba ho feta rōna.
I don't know what's wrong with this.	Ha ke tsebe hore na molato ke eng ka sena.
They slept very late at night.	Ba ile ba robala bosiu haholo.
It wasn't much, it seemed.	E ne e se e ngata, ho ne ho bonahala.
You need to know better.	O lokela ho tseba betere.
No, it was not.	Che, ho ne ho se joalo.
It has always been with us.	Haesale ho na le rona.
They could do this.	Ba ne ba ka etsa sena.
I think about that a lot.	Ke nahana ka seo haholo.
Little by little.	Hanyane ka hanyane.
Like our book.	Joalo ka buka ea rona.
He would understand this.	O ne a tla utloisisa sena.
I really did.	Ke hlile ke entse joalo.
So it could be someone else.	Kahoo e ka ba motho e mong.
There it is again.	Ke eo hape.
This is not the case.	Sena ha se joalo.
I felt worse all night.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke le mpe le ho feta bosiu bohle.
Or him ?.	Kapa eena?.
My husband could use it.	Monna oa ka o ne a ka e sebelisa.
And out of money.	Le ho tsoa ka chelete.
It looked so good to him.	E ne e shebahala e le ntle haholo ho eena.
He is still there.	O ntse a le teng.
Please think about it.	Ke kopa o e nahane.
They both went to school together.	Ba ne ba ile sekolong hammoho ka bobeli.
Getting there was even more difficult.	Ho fihla moo ho ne ho batla ho le thata le ho feta.
With these.	Ka tsena.
What I am.	Ke eng ke.
Then he takes them back.	Joale o li nka ka morao.
I knew exactly what was going to happen.	Ke ne ke tseba hantle se neng se tla etsahala.
But they were good to work with.	Empa ba bile hantle ho sebetsa le bona.
That will help things.	Seo se tla thusa lintho.
We got the money.	Re ile ra fumana chelete.
I think he is.	Ke nahana hore o teng.
As a child.	Joaloka ngoana.
There are some of them at this time.	Ho na le tse ling tsa tsona nakong ena.
In the evening, he began to see things.	Mantsiboea, o ile a qala ho bona lintho.
It has been this way.	Ho bile ka tsela ena.
It is true that there was water on the ground.	Ke 'nete hore ho ne ho e-na le metsi fatše.
It was just in time.	E ne e le ka nako hantle.
I'm going home.	Ke khutlela hae.
That is what happened, though.	Ke sona se ileng sa etsahala, leha ho le joalo.
I'm new to this.	Ke ncha ho sena.
This is old.	Sena ke sa khale.
I also have it sometimes.	Le 'na ke ba le eona ka linako tse ling.
I just do not understand why you want to do this.	Ke mpa ke sa utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha u batla ho etsa sena.
Also, for hours.	Hape, ka lihora tse ngata.
Read this book.	Bala buka ena.
I talk to him a lot.	Ke bua le eena haholo.
He was not there.	O ne a le sieo.
I can't do anything about him.	Ha ke khone ho etsa letho ka eena.
Maybe even leave him.	Mohlomong le ho mo tlohela.
It was all that was needed.	E ne e le sohle se neng se hlokahala.
I had to keep living.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tsoela pele ke phela.
The way it should be.	Tsela eo e lokelang ho ba ka eona.
He did not look at them for too long.	Ha aa ka a li sheba nako e telele haholo.
But it did not matter to them.	Empa ho ne ho se taba ho bona.
He refused to tell the police his name.	O ile a hana ho bolella mapolesa lebitso la hae.
So he went to a doctor.	Kahoo o ile a etela ngaka.
Everyone will have to know when to enter.	E mong le e mong o tla tlameha ho tseba hore ha a kena.
I will get back to you about that.	Ke tla khutlela ho uena ka taba eo.
We have to dress up for dinner.	Re tlameha ho apara bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
To most people it is both.	Ho batho ba bangata ke bobeli.
But you know, people always say you look like a person.	Empa ua tseba, batho ba lula ba re u shebahala joaloka motho.
I have to get out of here.	Ke tlameha ho tsoa mona.
He did not know who it was and did not know why.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke ofe mme a sa tsebe lebaka.
She likes to read books.	O rata ho bala libuka.
Prior to this, she only knew her mother.	Pele ho mona, o ne a tseba mme feela.
Bosiu.	Bosiu.
I would save him.	Ke ne ke tla mo boloka.
I was expecting that.	Ke ne ke lebeletse seo.
Look at what you did in the past.	Sheba seo u se entseng nakong e fetileng.
I want that for myself.	Ke batla seo bakeng sa ka.
You should be finishing fast.	O lokela hore ebe o qeta kapele.
I did not know who he was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke mang.
Maybe it can.	Mohlomong e ka khona.
For many, that process was painful.	Ho ba bangata, mokhoa oo o ne o le bohloko haholo.
However, it is just beginning.	Leha ho le joalo, e ntse e qala.
He knew it well.	O ne a e tseba hantle.
One thing at a time.	Ntho e le 'ngoe ka nako.
Can you think of anything?	O ka nahana ka eng kapa eng?
We really like it here.	Re e rata mona hantle.
You can't ask someone else not to tell someone.	U ke ke ua kopa motho e mong hore a se ke a bolella e mong.
We just love to eat !.	Re rata ho ja feela!.
Maybe I was with him.	Mohlomong ke ne ke le teng le eena.
We do not say that.	Ha re bue joalo.
Nobody knows how to do that.	Haho motho ya tsebang ho etsa seo.
They know what we are.	Ba tseba seo re leng sona.
No, that's not a problem.	Che, ha se bothata.
You do not need it.	Ha o e hloke.
They go to it.	Ba ea ho eona.
Near the school.	Haufi le sekolo.
Also, you still may not think of it as fun.	Hape, u ntse u ka 'na ua se ke ua nahana hore e monate hakaalo.
You can never predict what will happen.	Le ka mohla u ke ke ua bolela se tla etsahala.
These are not his questions.	Ha se lipotso tsa hae.
We always did things together as a team.	Kamehla re ne re etsa lintho re le sehlopha.
Besides, it takes a lot of hard work.	Ntle ho moo, ho hloka mosebetsi o boima haholo.
I wanted to finish my homework before dinner.	Ke ne ke batla ho qeta mosebetsi oa ka oa sekolo pele ho lijo tsa mantsiboea.
It was as if they had never seen anything before.	E ne eka ha ho letho leo ba neng ba le bone pele.
The last issue.	Taba ea ho qetela.
It will definitely return.	Ka sebele e tla khutla.
You are already beautiful.	O se o le motle.
You have to do it once again.	U tlameha ho e etsa hang hape.
Getting more.	Ho fumana ho feta.
It doesn't have to be.	Ha ho hlokahale hore e be teng.
Do you like to write?	O rata ho ngola?
We really are, as a group.	Re hlile re joalo, re le sehlopha.
And here we are again.	Mme ke rona bana hape.
I could really feel it.	Ke ne ke hlile ke e utloa.
Exactly right.	Hantle le hantle.
He was talking to himself, apparently.	O ne a bua a le mong, ho bonahala.
It can't have one.	E ka se be le e 'ngoe.
Now is my time to watch.	Joale ke nako ea ka ea ho shebella.
You must have some of your own.	U tlameha ho ba le tse ling tsa hau.
I would love to know what it is.	Nka thabela ho tseba hore na ke eng.
It was really easy.	E ne e hlile e le bonolo.
I hear them.	Kea li utloa.
They gave him an idea.	Ba mo fa mohopolo.
They feel they have enough.	Ba ikutloa hore ba na le ho lekaneng.
I looked around the room.	Ke ile ka sheba ka kamoreng.
I thought she was beautiful.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o motle.
It seemed to work well.	E ne e bonahala e sebetsa hantle.
People come, go.	Batho ba tla, ba tsamaea.
They have a lot of things.	Ba na le lintho tse ngata.
Wanting to sleep.	Ho batla ho robala.
We went out.	Re ile ra tsoa.
That was difficult for the whole team.	Seo se ne se le thata ho sehlopha sohle sa rona.
He cried all night.	A lla bosiu kaofela.
Of course, this is not always the case.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho joalo kamehla.
I have no problem with this.	Ha ke na mathata ka sena.
Are you writing a letter?	A na u ngola lengolo?
But it is not easy.	Empa ha ho bonolo.
Please, go.	Ka kopo, tsamaea.
Finally he stood up.	Qetellong a ema ka maoto.
We will talk to them.	Re tla bua le bona.
Do your homework tomorrow night.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau oa sekolo hosane bosiu.
He no longer felt anything near sleep.	Ha aa ka a hlola a utloa letho le haufi le ho robala.
They love their children very much.	Ba rata bana ba bona haholo.
I'm not sure what to do.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke etse eng.
He goes home.	O ya hae.
Then the people were there.	Joale batho ba ne ba le teng.
We hope you too will find it useful.	Re tšepa hore le uena u tla e fumana e le ea bohlokoa.
We want to get out of here.	Re batla ho tloha mona.
He can work with that.	A ka sebetsa le seo.
But they refused.	Empa ba ile ba hana.
Only he knew that he was real.	Ke eena feela ea neng a tseba hore ke oa sebele.
Things will be difficult, but you will get through them.	Lintho li tla ba thata, empa u tla feta ho tsona.
However, yours is not.	Leha ho le joalo, ea hau ha e joalo.
Everything they need, they will have.	Sohle seo ba se hlokang, ba tla ba le sona.
And it really hurts, if you think about it.	'Me e hlile e bohloko, haeba u nahana ka eona.
People who love them, of course, really love them.	Batho ba ba ratang, ruri, ba hlile ba ba rata.
The point is to feel behind and outside of them.	Taba ke ho ikutloa ka morao le ka ntle ho bona.
Maybe they can be very important.	Mohlomong li ka ba tsa bohlokoa haholo.
He was always happy to see them.	O ne a lula a thabela ho bona.
The man is hurt.	Monna o utloile bohloko.
I just wanted to know if people were saying that or not.	Ke ne ke batla ho tseba feela hore na batho ba bua joalo kapa che.
It looks like my age.	E shebahala ka lilemo tsa ka.
Maybe he still loved her.	Mohlomong o ne a ntse a mo rata.
You need to fear him.	U lokela ho mo tšaba.
Nobody can do that.	Haho motho ya ka etsang seo.
And my family.	Le lelapa la ka.
There must be one benefit to being a woman.	Ho tlameha ho ba le molemo o le mong oa ho ba mosali.
He was the only one.	E ne e le eena feela.
They don’t care about everything.	Ha ba tsotelle ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
I'm going to bed.	Ke il'o robala.
They just look.	Ba sheba feela.
We don't know it.	Ha re e tsebe.
It was just that.	Ho ne ho le joalo feela.
I would not be here otherwise.	Ke ne nke ke ka ba mona ho seng joalo.
There is a lot of danger here.	Ho na le kotsi e ngata mona.
Of course, he realized that he still had much to learn.	Ke ’nete, o ile a hlokomela hore o ne a sa ntse a lokela ho ithuta lintho tse ngata.
Good thing about it.	Ntho e ntle ea eona.
If you are in the area, wait.	Haeba u sebakeng seo, ema.
I am here now.	Ke teng hona joale.
Since then no one has been strong enough.	Ho tloha ka nako eo ha ho motho ea neng a le matla ka ho lekaneng.
But three times.	Empa ka makhetlo a mararo.
We think it was a mistake.	Re nka hore e ne e le phoso.
But he would not tell anyone.	Empa a ka be a sa ka a bolella motho.
And then, once again, nothing.	'Me joale, hang hape, ha ho letho.
He has no good news.	Ha a na litaba tse monate.
Then you have to do something about it.	Joale u lokela ho etsa ho hong ka eena.
They make a mistake.	Ba etsa phoso.
I understand why you have to do this.	Kea utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha u tlameha ho etsa sena.
He did not cry	Ha a ka a lla
He had done it.	O ne a e entse.
That will tell you.	Seo se tla o bolella.
They could not be.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba ba jwalo.
I can't find it either.	Le 'na ha ke e fumane.
What would you like to drink?	O tla thabela ho noa eng?
And that's life too.	Mme ke bophelo le bona.
It doesn't have to be right now.	Ha ho hlokahale hore e be hona joale.
But it was.	Empa ho ne ho le jwalo.
This is not new news.	Tsena ha se litaba tse ncha.
I wanted it.	Ke ne ke o batla.
But that is not what happened.	Empa ha se se ileng sa etsahala.
The reason is very simple.	Lebaka le bonolo haholo.
Otherwise, she was wearing nothing.	Ho seng joalo, o ne a sa apara letho.
I don't seem to find anything to work with.	Ho bonahala ke sa fumane letho ho sebetsa.
Or they don’t, and they don’t.	Kapa ha ba etse joalo, 'me ha ho joalo.
We need an alternative.	Re hloka mokhoa o mong.
I want you for me.	Ke batla wena ka nna.
You could have given him time.	O ka be o ile wa mo fa nako.
I thought he did.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o entse joalo.
I don’t think it can happen but it is something that can happen.	Ha ke nahane hore ho ka etsahala empa ke ntho e ka etsahalang.
Where is that? 	Ke kae moo?
They can fix this.	Ba ka lokisa sena.
he asked.	a botsa.
The grass was soft.	Joang bo ne bo le bonolo.
I thought you might like to hear.	Ke ne ke nahana hore u ka rata ho ikutloa .
So should you.	Kahoo le uena u lokela ho etsa se tšoanang.
Instead of a simple method.	Ho e-na le mokhoa o bonolo.
We know how to live.	Re tseba ho phela.
More now after seeing that picture.	Ho feta joale ka mor'a ho bona setšoantšo seo.
However, it did not matter.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se taba.
It has to be even easier.	E tlameha ho ba bonolo le ho feta.
Things were still not easy.	Lintho li ne li ntse li se bonolo.
So, we did it.	Kahoo, re ile ra e etsa.
We'll let it go now.	Re tla e tlohela hona joale.
I knew it was just a matter of time.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ke taba ea nako feela.
In the end, we are not better off.	Qetellong, ha re betere.
They will come at once.	Ba tla tla hang.
The police did not arrive at all.	Mapolesa ha aa ka a fihla ho hang.
Sometimes it happens that way.	Ka linako tse ling ho etsahala ka tsela eo.
That was the only thing they could do.	Ke eona feela ntho eo ba neng ba ka e etsa.
She was so beautiful that way.	O ne a le motle haholo ka tsela eo.
True or not.	Ke 'nete kapa che.
He ate breakfast ahead of time.	O ile a ja lijo tsa hoseng pele ho nako.
For the first time with my children.	Lekhetlo la pele ho nna le bana ba ka.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
But he clearly was.	Empa ho hlakile hore o ne a le joalo.
That day may come.	Letsatsi leo le ka tla.
No one had ever visited him.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a mo etela.
When you find him.	Ha o mo fumana.
Like, it just seems to me.	Joalo ka, e bonahala ho nna feela.
Breakfast time.	Nako ea ho ja lijo tsa hoseng.
It is not ours.	Ha se ea rona.
Be with us today !.	Eba le rona kajeno!.
That is, if it works tonight.	Ke hore, haeba e sebetsa bosiung bona.
They were done.	Ba ne ba qetile.
If it was good, forget about it.	Haeba e ne e le ntle, lebala ka eona.
This room is important, of course.	Kamore ena ke ea bohlokoa, ho hlakile.
It's a very strange thing.	Ke ntho e makatsang haholo.
I have no chance.	Ha ke na monyetla.
They should ask everything.	Ba lokela ho botsa tsohle.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho tsamaea.
But it would be very dangerous.	Empa ho ne ho tla ba kotsi haholo.
I hope you like it.	Ke tšepa u tla e rata.
That's just the way it is.	Ke taba e joalo feela.
No one was talking to anyone.	Ho ne ho se motho ya buang le e mong.
He did not think that would be the problem.	O ne a sa nahane hore seo e tla ba bothata.
People will have to write.	Batho ba tla ba le ho ngola.
He did it alone.	O e entse a le mong.
No one has ever been sure.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a ba le bonnete.
Things are like that.	Lintho li joalo.
That is why my father decided to leave.	Ke kahoo Ntate a ileng a etsa qeto ea ho tsamaea.
But the reunion happened.	Empa ho kopana ho ile ha etsahala.
But notice this.	Empa hlokomela sena.
To hear him.	Ho mo utloa.
It doesn't have to be complicated.	Ha ho hlokahale hore e be thata.
He wished he had not come.	O ne a lakatsa eka ha a ka a tla.
He would know soon.	O ne a tla tseba haufinyane.
I work with you.	Ke sebetsa le uena.
He never gave up.	Ha A ka a tlohela.
Nothing will happen if people do nothing.	Ha ho letho le tla etsahala haeba batho ba sa etse letho.
He has always died.	Haesale a hlokahala.
Otherwise, you would not have gone to talk to me.	Ho seng joalo, o ka be o sa ka oa tsamaea ho ea bua le 'na.
Or maybe even.	Kapa mohlomong le.
This is very easy to do.	Sena se bonolo haholo ho se etsa.
Until that night.	Ho fihlela bosiung boo.
You think that if anyone knows, it must be him.	U nahana hore haeba ho na le motho ea tsebang, e tlameha ebe ke eena.
I think so.	Ke nahana hore ho joalo.
This is a very nice place.	Sena ke sebaka se setle haholo.
Their only recourse was to express their feelings.	Molato oa bona e ne e le ho bua maikutlo a bona feela.
However, nothing special.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho letho la bohlokoa.
Just getting started.	Ho qala feela.
But his work was very good.	Empa mosebetsi oa hae o ne o le motle haholo.
He seems to have it.	Ho bonahala eka o na le eona.
He had no friends.	O ne a se na metsoalle.
It could have been anyone.	E ka be e bile mang kapa mang.
It is a long time coming.	Ke nako e telele e tlang.
But that woman was another matter.	Empa mosali eo e ne e le taba e ’ngoe.
He will be tired.	O tla be a khathetse.
Some even think this way.	Ba bang le bona ba nahana ka tsela ena.
We have not been able to do that.	Ha rea ​​khona ho etsa joalo.
We can use whatever we decide in the future.	Re ka sebelisa eng kapa eng eo re e etsang qeto nakong e tlang.
That would be better.	Hoo ho ka ba betere.
You are not my child.	Ha u ngoana oa ka.
It is an important book.	Ke buka ea bohlokoa.
He had just met her.	O ne a sa tsoa kopana le eena.
No one was enjoying this.	Ho ne ho se motho ya neng a thabela sena.
They were the ones who said it.	Ke bona ba neng ba e bolela.
He looks at the clock again.	O sheba nako hape.
I think about it more than anyone else could.	Ke nahana ka eona ho feta kamoo ho seng motho ea neng a ka khona.
That's a good fact.	Ke 'nete e ntle.
They were very tall and heavy.	Li ne li le telele haholo li bile li le boima.
It will still take time.	E ntse e tla hloka nako.
I have a good one.	Ke na le molemo.
He looked back.	A sheba morao.
Never, never, never.	Le ka mohla, le ka mohla, le ka mohla.
I hope you will always be there.	Ke tšepa hore u tla lula u le teng.
They had just bought a new dog.	Ba ne ba sa tsoa reka ntja e ncha.
You can study here if you wish.	U ka ithuta mona haeba u lakatsa.
He is indeed a man.	Ka sebele ke monna.
It was good for him that most people did not believe.	Ho ne ho le molemo ho eena hore ebe batho ba bangata ba ne ba sa lumele.
We can think of this in another way.	Re ka nahana ka sena ka tsela e ’ngoe.
You will love them.	U tla ba rata.
Now look at us.	Joale sheba rona.
He does a great job.	O etsa mosebetsi o moholo.
He does not know who he is.	Ha a tsebe hore na ke mang.
The question is not how to give them space but how.	Potso ha se hore na ho ba fa sebaka empa joang.
They were already there.	Ba ne ba se ba le teng.
Stand in a position and say exactly what you want to say.	Ema sebakeng 'me u bue hantle seo u batlang ho se bua.
Life is no different.	Bophelo le bona ha bo joalo.
Eventually he disappeared.	Qetellong o ile a feela.
I try to think of everything that has happened to me.	Ke leka ho nahana ka lintho tsohle tse etsahetseng ho 'na.
It feels real.	E ikutloa e le ea sebele.
It works very well.	E sebetsa hantle haholo.
I will not stay long.	Ha ke na ho lula nako e telele.
He knew it and knew he knew it.	O ne a e tseba mme a tseba hore o a e tseba.
But we will not leave him.	Empa re ke ke ra mo tlohela.
Just note the location.	Hlokomela sebaka feela.
Then he spoke.	Eaba oa bua.
The boy was living alone.	Moshanyana eo o ne a lula a le mong.
I do not want you here.	Ha ke o batle mona.
He had to get out of here.	O ile a tlameha ho tsoa mona.
It was very powerful.	E ne e le matla haholo.
I read all the books.	Ke ne ke bala libuka tsohle.
Now to my question.	Joale ho potso ea ka.
As we did.	Joalo ka ha re entse.
Start with the fact that you are not many people.	Qala ka taba ea hore ha u batho ba bangata.
I love you so much.	Ke o rata haholo.
And now, we hope you enjoy your meal.	'Me joale, re tšepa hore u tla thabela lijo tsa hau.
That would have made all of this even more difficult.	Seo se ka be se entse hore sena sohle se be thata le ho feta.
It was strange to his wife, too.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang ho mosali oa hae, le eena.
I would rather be alone.	Nka mpa ka dula ke le mong.
He was right where he was.	O ne a le hantle moo a neng a le teng.
I found this one here.	Ke fumane ena mona.
Of course, they did not.	Ha e le hantle, ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
I'm glad to be here.	Ke thabetse ho ba mona.
But there was.	Empa ho ne ho le teng.
He is my son's son.	Ke mora oa mora oa ka.
We have to use everything available.	Re lokela ho sebelisa tsohle tse teng.
You are using the law.	U sebelisa molao.
It was my first time away from home.	E ne e le lekhetlo la ka la pele ke le sieo hae.
I mean, very good.	Ke bolela hore e ntle haholo.
You get a headache just thinking about it here.	U tšoaroa ke hlooho ka lebaka la ho nahana feela ka mona.
It did not go as he had hoped.	Ha ea ka ea tsamaea kamoo a neng a lebeletse kateng.
It can still work.	E ntse e ka sebetsa.
I'm still there.	Ke ntse ke le teng.
I knew this place very well.	Ke ne ke tseba sebaka sena hantle.
They really look at the man.	Ba hlile ba sheba monna eo.
It is a handicraft from here.	Ke mosebetsi oa matsoho ho tloha mona.
He had to work harder.	O ne a lokela ho sebetsa ka thata ho feta.
This is a problem for me.	Sena ke bothata ho nna.
It was a group, yet all their problems.	E ne e le sehlopha, leha ho le joalo mathata a bona kaofela.
He needed a weapon.	O ne a hloka sebetsa.
I can't eat or sleep.	Ha ke khone ho ja kapa hona ho robala.
Apart from me there is something wrong with this image.	Ntle le 'na ho na le ho hong ho phoso ka setšoantšo sena.
This is my place, more and more.	Sena ke sebaka sa ka, ho feta le ho feta.
I was very busy.	Ke ne ke phathahane haholo.
That was not enough.	Seo se ne se sa lekana.
If you want to go, let's go.	Haeba u batla ho tsamaea, a re tsamaee.
In fact, he was there.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a le teng.
We too are not sure.	Le rona ha re tsebe hantle.
This book is about how to get there.	Buka ena e bua ka mokhoa oa ho fihla moo.
Don't tell anyone.	Se bolelle mang kapa mang.
I haven't seen him or thought about him for years.	Ke lilemo tse ngata ke sa mo bone kapa hona ho nahana ka eena.
They took the place.	Ba nkile sebaka.
He was the best dog ever.	E ne e le ntja e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
It was great fun.	E ne e le monate o moholo.
That's just true.	Ke 'nete feela.
I do not know how to do it can you help.	Ha ke tsebe ho e etsa joang u ka u thusa.
Then he opened them again, just enough to look down.	Eaba oa li bula hape, tse lekaneng feela ho sheba fatše.
Never trust them.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua ba tšepa.
Then we'll just have to see.	Joale re tla tlameha ho bona feela.
No one will take it.	Ha ho motho ea tla e nka.
This is what will happen.	Sena ke se tla etsahala.
I visited once.	Ke ile ka etela hang.
People are talking about food.	Batho ba ntse ba bua ka lijo.
None of us spoke.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea ileng a bua.
The house was empty.	Ntlo e ne e se na letho.
Or try to be.	Kapa leka ho ba.
It wasn’t the best, but it worked.	E ne e se molemo ka ho fetisisa, empa e ile ea sebetsa.
Do you have friends?	O na le metsoalle?
I wanted her to know my friends.	Ke ne ke batla hore a tsebe metsoalle ea ka.
Otherwise it works just fine.	Ho seng joalo o sebetsa hantle feela.
He just knew he didn't want to be alone.	O ne a tseba feela hore ha a batle ho ba mong.
But it is clear.	Empa ho hlakile.
He was able to walk well.	O ne a khona ho tsamaea hantle.
That's right now.	Ho jwalo jwale.
He always walked to school.	O ne a lula a tsamaea ka maoto ho ea sekolong.
We could talk about that.	Re ne re ka bua ka taba eo.
He was obviously older than he was.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a le moholo ho seo a se entseng.
I got to see both of them.	Ke ile ka fihla ho bona ka bobeli.
Clearly, we have work to do.	Ho hlakile hore re na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa.
Everyone is suffering.	E mong le e mong o utloa bohloko.
He really did not want to go there.	O ne a hlile a sa batle ho ea moo.
I felt that way.	Ke ile ka ikutloa joalo.
After yesterday.	Ka mor'a maobane .
Money is important to me.	Chelete ke ea bohlokoa ho 'na.
No one is coming.	Ha ho motho ea tlang.
I think some might think so.	Ke nahana hore ba bang ba ka nahana hore ho joalo.
And that makes them go away.	Le hona ho etsa hore ba tsamaee.
I spent a lot of time with my parents.	Ke ne ke qeta nako e ngata le batsoali ba ka.
We are no longer talking.	Ha re sa bua.
Unless it can be fun to have a car.	Ntle le hore ho ka ba monate ho ba le koloi.
They can fix all that and more.	Ba ka lokisa tseo tsohle le tse ling.
I like being here.	Ke rata ho ba mona.
I thought there might have been an accident or something.	Ke ne ke nahana hore mohlomong ho bile le kotsi kapa ho hong.
I think he is talking to everyone.	Ke nahana hore o bua le batho bohle.
I could not read his thoughts.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho bala maikutlo a hae.
But you do not have to be.	Empa ha ho hlokahale hore u be joalo.
He drove the car.	O ile a khanna koloi.
It is a team name.	Ke lebitso la sehlopha.
That will not happen.	Seo se ke ke sa etsahala.
Then it was that day.	Joale e ne e le letsatsi leo.
I need to hear him.	Ke hloka ho mo utloa.
Hard working.	O sebetsa ka thata.
You have decided.	U entse qeto.
They can sleep well at night.	Ba ka robala hantle bosiu.
It is a wonderful time for us now.	Ke nako e monate ho rona hona joale.
I can say this.	Nka bolela sena.
He should see her and her children.	O lokela ho mo bona le bana ba hae.
However, that is my point.	Leha ho le joalo, ke taba ea ka.
It's really weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang ruri.
He always wanted to know.	O ile a lula a batla ho tseba.
It did, in a way.	E entse joalo, ka mokhoa o itseng.
Of course, it was good, maybe even better.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le ntle, mohlomong le ho feta.
Somehow, it happened.	Ka tsela e itseng, ho ile ha etsahala.
I sleep a lot.	Ke robala haholo.
Out of the other.	Ho tsoa ho e 'ngoe.
You really made me go.	Ka 'nete u entse hore ke tsamaee.
However, this is still very important.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se ntse se le bohlokoa haholo.
I will not give up.	Nke ke ka tlohela.
It would be useless.	Ho ka be ho se na thuso.
I will start tomorrow.	Ke tla qala hosane.
It's just your kind, you know.	Ke mofuta oa hau feela, ua tseba.
We certainly had to reject the people.	Ka sebele re ile ra tlameha ho hana batho.
It seemed to him that he could do just that.	Ho eena ho ne ho bonahala a ka tsoela pele hantle feela.
I found a lot of things.	Ke fumane lintho tse ngata.
I am not, of course.	Ha ke joalo, ka 'nete.
Something weird for you.	Ntho e 'ngoe e makatsang bakeng sa hau.
We will have to overcome that.	Re tla lokela ho hlola seo.
What we know, too.	Seo re se tsebang, le rona.
Maybe we can save some.	Mohlomong re ka boloka tse ling.
Give things a chance.	Fana ka lintho monyetla.
It can help.	Ho ka thusa.
that was the question.	eo e ne e le potso.
I was sure he would say the same thing.	Ke ne ke na le bonnete ba hore o tla bua ntho e tšoanang.
We went back and back.	Re ile ra khutlela morao 'me ra khutlela morao.
For others, it was just last week.	Ho ba bang, e ne e le bekeng e fetileng.
Everyone wants it.	Bohle ba e batla.
You need it, they have it.	Ua e hloka, ba na le eona.
It is very easy to do.	Ho bonolo haholo ho e etsa.
I could imagine what he was thinking.	Ke ne ke khona ho nahana hore na o ne a nahana eng.
Probably better, too.	Mohlomong betere, hape.
It would.	E ne e tla etsa joalo.
It looks good to me.	E shebahala hantle ho nna.
But we have no sense without you.	Empa ha re na kelello ntle le uena.
He finds nothing.	Ha a fumane letho.
And he knows everything.	Mme o tseba tsohle.
All of that will leave you right where you were.	Sohle seo se tla o tlohela hantle moo o neng o le teng.
Nothing about reality.	Ha ho letho ka 'nete.
He was always trying to buy his way into something.	O ne a lula a leka ho reka tsela ea hae ea ho kena ho hong.
Well my weight stayed this week.	Hantle boima ba ka bo ile ba lula bekeng ena.
He was about to leave when he saw it.	O ne a le haufi le ho tsamaea ha a e bona.
Some people have it.	Batho ba bang ba na le eona.
Besides, you are not one of us.	Ntle le moo, ha u e mong oa rona.
They convince us to do nothing.	Ba re kholisa ka ho se etse letho.
I want to talk about it.	Ke batla ho bua ka eona.
I did both during my spare time.	Ke entse ka bobeli nakong ea nako ea ka.
She is a great mother.	Ke mme e moholo.
I didn't get that without time.	Ha kea fumana seo ntle le nako.
They know where the best time to go is.	Ba tseba moo nako e molemo ka ho fetisisa e lokelang ho ba teng.
He can drink.	A ka noa.
I do not need this.	Ha ke hloke sena.
But the truth is something else.	Empa 'nete ke ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I can tell you a lot right now.	Nka o bolella haholo hona jwale.
I spent all my time with my mom and dad.	Ke qetile nako eohle le 'Mè le ntate oa ka oa bobeli.
And he kept writing.	Mme a nna a ngola.
When I was in high school.	Ha ke le sekolong se phahameng.
I'll meet you soon.	Ke tla kopana haufinyane.
But the police did.	Empa mapolesa a ile a etsa joalo.
You do not want to help my work.	Ha u batle ho thusa mosebetsi oa ka.
He is right there.	O teng hantle.
Do whatever you do.	Etsa eng kapa eng eo u e etsang.
Fourth, look at your beautiful new clothes.	Ea bone, sheba liaparo tsa hao tse ntle tse ncha.
Job availability is a legal issue.	Ho ba teng ha mosebetsi ke taba ea molao.
Do you feel that way?	Na u ikutloa joalo?
It's a difficult place.	Ke sebaka se thata.
I don't think it's a good thing.	Ha ke nahane hore ke ntho e ntle.
I could not think of it.	Ke ne nke ke ka nahana ka eona.
No one can.	Ha ho motho ea ka khonang.
We are always happy to hear from you.	Re lula re thabela ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
And before too long.	Mme pele ho nako e telele haholo.
We continued walking.	Re ile ra tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
I can't do it with him.	Ha ke khone le eena.
Time is of the essence.	Nako ke ntho e thata.
eo.	eo.
They always look good.	Li shebahala li le ntle ka linako tsohle.
Then we became heavy.	Eaba re ba boima.
They will live.	Ba tla phela.
Any chance for tonight.	Monyetla ofe kapa ofe bakeng sa bosiung bona.
He picked up the book.	O ile a nka buka eo.
That we know very well.	Seo re se tseba hantle.
The last few years have been very difficult.	Lilemo tse 'maloa tse fetileng li bile thata haholo.
He did not understand why he was there.	O ne a sa utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha a le moo.
I felt so strongly.	Ke ile ka ikutloa joalo ka matla.
I do not know where it is.	Ha ke tsebe moo e leng teng.
There are no questions until you finish.	Ha ho na lipotso ho fihlela u qeta.
He is indeed the most bizarre person, he thinks.	Ka sebele ke motho ea makatsang ka ho fetisisa, a nahana joalo.
Nice to meet you.	Ke thabetse ho kopana le wena.
But that is no longer the case.	Empa ha e sa le joalo.
She had seen him for a long time.	E ne e se e le khale a mo bona.
It would not have happened to me.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha etsahala ho 'na.
He knows it, they know it.	O a e tseba, ba a e tseba.
We had a lot of things we wanted.	Re ne re e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo re li batlang.
Things like that.	Lintho tsa mofuta oo.
He tried several times but could not continue.	O ile a leka ka makhetlo a 'maloa empa a sitoa ho tsoela pele.
Make a first call.	E etse pele mokhoa oa ho letsetsa.
You would see it happen.	O ne o tla e bona e etsahala.
I think they did, you know.	Ke nahana hore ba entse joalo, ua tseba.
I can't find anything.	Ha ke fumane letho.
I just said that, baby.	Ke sa tsoa bua joalo, ngoana.
He will pass.	O tla feta.
It's a wonderful thing to have.	Ke ntho e monate ho ba le eona.
I eventually returned home.	Qetellong ke ile ka khutlela hae.
I tried to cry first.	Ke ile ka leka ho lla pele.
Probably one of the first to do this.	Mohlomong e mong oa ba pele ba ho etsa sena.
Have dinner together.	Ja lijo tsa mantsiboea hammoho.
It is very difficult to reach.	Ho thata haholo ho fihla.
If so, that's a good idea.	Haeba ho joalo, ke mohopolo o motle.
Nobody knows where you are.	Haho motho ya tsebang moo o leng teng.
Because he could.	Hobane o ne a ka khona.
I do not know why, but he is there.	Ha ke tsebe hobaneng, empa o teng.
That it is empty.	Hore ha e na letho.
I don't care what you think.	Ha ke tsotelle seo o se nahanang.
What will it be, what will it be like.	Ho tla ba joang, ho tla ba joang.
Not at all.	Ho hang ha ho joalo.
I could have asked more questions.	Nka be ke ile ka botsa lipotso tse ling.
For others, it may not be.	Ba bang, mohlomong ha ho joalo.
I had heard so much, so fast.	Ke ne ke utloile haholo, kapele haholo.
However, in reality, it is often not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e le hantle, hangata ha ho joalo.
I have to know.	Ke tlameha ho tseba.
You and your wife were happy.	Uena le mosali oa hao le ne le thabile.
His house is a simple matter.	Ntlo ea hae ke taba e bonolo.
They fell asleep.	Ba ile ba robala.
He had to achieve that.	O ne a lokela ho fihlela seo.
The same is true of books.	Ho joalo le ka libuka.
I didn't know anybody, I never was, I just went.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe motho, ha ke eso be teng, ke ile feela.
The dog did.	Ntja ya etsa jwalo.
It certainly could work.	Ka sebele e ne e ka sebetsa.
And, of course, no such letter may be required.	’Me ka sebele, ha ho lengolo le joalo le ka ’nang la hlokahala.
It is never too easy.	Ha ho mohla ho ba bonolo haholo.
It is very difficult.	Ho thata haholo.
The problem is that you do not.	Bothata ke hore ha u etse joalo.
I would like to go back and look again.	Nka batla ho khutlela morao ho ea sheba hape.
That way you can get him to do whatever you want him to do.	Tsela eo e ka etsang hore o etse eng kapa eng eo e batlang hore o e etse.
I can't stand it.	Ha ke khone ho ema.
You would need.	U ne u tla hloka.
More than this.	Ho feta mona.
They both went.	Bobeli ba ile.
They want the best ideas from anyone, anywhere.	Ba batla maikutlo a molemo ka ho fetisisa ho tsoa ho mang kapa mang, kae kapa kae.
But he was a special man.	Empa e ne e le monna oa bohlokoa.
There is nothing we can do at this time.	Ha ho letho leo re ka le etsang nakong ena.
That's not too much.	Tseo ha li ngata haholo.
They become lifelong friends.	E ba metsoalle ea bophelo bohle.
He stood with me.	A ema le nna.
She needs her coffee.	O hloka kofi ea hae.
It's just beautiful.	E ntle feela.
We love to be our own.	Re rata ho ba rona.
This too did not go well.	Sena le sona ha sea ka sa tsamaea hantle.
This is not a good job.	Sena ha se mosebetsi o motle.
He stood there.	A ema moo.
The rest is mine.	Tse ling kaofela ke tsa ka.
That now seems unlikely.	Seo hona joale se bonahala se ke ke sa etsahala.
No, of course not.	Che, ha e le hantle, che.
Without you.	Ntle le uena.
There is nothing for them.	Ha ho na letho bakeng sa bona.
The more you work, the more money.	Ha u sebetsa haholo, chelete e ngata.
It is just as important.	E bohlokoa joalo feela.
Please, man.	Ka kopo, monna.
They have to go to school.	Ba tlameha ho ea sekolong.
But we never talked about food.	Empa ha ho mohla re kileng ra bua ka lijo.
These are good.	Tsena li ntle.
We need to play well.	Re hloka ho bapala hantle.
But he refused to go.	Empa a hana ho ya.
Certainly not to a man.	Ka sebele ha ho joalo ho monna.
But, he's doing a head thing.	Empa, o ntse a etsa ntho ya hlooho.
But nothing worked.	Empa ha ho letho le ileng la sebetsa.
It was not just us.	E ne e se rōna feela.
You will learn by doing.	U tla ithuta ka ho etsa.
I really do.	Ke hlile ke etsa joalo.
It was so.	Ho ne ho le jwalo.
No one will want to read it.	Ha ho motho ea tla batla ho e bala.
However, this is not the case or rather, it is not.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se joalo kapa ho e-na le hoo, ha ho joalo.
I can't see it.	Ha ke khone ho e bona.
Therefore, this method is not very effective.	Ka hona, mokhoa ona ha o na matla haholo.
He decided to try another method.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho leka mokhoa o mong.
He was a teacher.	E ne e le tichere.
I have a chance to buy it.	Ke na le monyetla oa ho e reka.
I found the matter difficult.	Ke ile ka fumana taba eo e le thata.
He had never done that before.	O ne a e-s'o ka a etsa joalo pele.
I finished second.	Ke ile ka qeta oa bobeli.
It should not fall.	Ha ea lokela ho oa.
He had trouble walking.	O ne a na le bothata ba ho tsamaea.
People are talking about that even now.	Batho ba ntse ba bua ka seo le jwale.
There are no weird surprises.	Ha ho na lintho tse makatsang tse makatsang.
The man went to sleep.	Monna a ya robala.
We could not have our children.	Re ne re sa khone ho ba le bana ba rōna.
Thanks for reading.	Kea leboha ha u bala.
There was your error.	Ho bile le phoso ea hau.
He will know the way.	O tla tseba tsela.
A week after another.	Beke ka mor'a hore ho be le e 'ngoe.
He was there every week giving his money and his precious time.	O ne a le teng beke le beke a fana ka chelete le nako ea hae ea bohlokoa.
Some seemed to know only his name.	Ba bang ba ne ba bonahala ba tseba lebitso la hae feela.
We had that idea.	Re ne re e-na le mohopolo oo.
This is just another story.	Ena ke taba e 'ngoe feela.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
But, of course, he did not say such a thing.	Empa, ha e le hantle, ha aa ka a bua ntho e joalo.
You have to call.	O lokela ho letsa.
One thing is certain.	Taba e le 'ngoe e bohlokoa.
But it's hard, it's very hard.	Empa ho thata, ho thata haholo.
I go back to the current year.	Ke khutlela selemong sa hona joale.
Not sure if it will work.	Ha e na bonnete ba hore e ea sebetsa.
I didn’t think you could do it.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore o ka e etsa.
She no longer loved him, she thought as she loved him.	O ne a se a sa mo rate, o ne a nahana joalo ka ha a ne a mo rata.
All of this has made you what you are today.	Sena sohle se u entse seo u leng sona kajeno.
Ground power.	Matla a fatše.
I had to make one final decision.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho etsa qeto ea ho qetela.
Sometimes you have to work fast.	Ka nako e 'ngoe u tlameha ho sebetsa kapele.
He wants to spend more time with his family.	O batla ho qeta nako e ngata le lelapa la hae.
We think this was a mistake.	Re nka hore sena e ne e le phoso.
I had food and water.	Ke ne ke na le lijo le metsi.
I had never heard a woman talk like this before.	Ke ne ke qala ho utloa mosali a bua ka tsela ena.
He would do anything.	O ne a tla etsa eng kapa eng.
If so, it was too late.	Haeba ho joalo, e ne e se e le morao haholo.
He could not walk or speak.	O ne a sa khone ho tsamaea kapa ho bua.
But this news is nothing new to me.	Empa litaba tsena hase ntho e ncha ho ’na.
Life for life.	Bophelo bakeng sa bophelo.
I really want to talk to you.	Ke hlile ke batla ho bua le uena.
But she was still beautiful.	Empa o ne a ntse a le motle.
Sometimes a person needs to be tough.	Ka linako tse ling motho o hloka ho ba thata.
This will not go away.	Sena se ke ke sa tloha.
It really is something.	Ehlile ke ntho e itseng.
What they had was real, powerful, and very powerful.	Seo ba neng ba e-na le sona e ne e le sa 'nete, se matla, 'me se le matla haholo.
Then the second one.	Eaba oa bobeli.
I could not decide.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa qeto.
To this day, they still do not know.	Ho fihlela kajeno, ba ne ba ntse ba sa tsebe.
And it's so much fun.	'Me ho monate haholo.
The important thing now was to find out who he was.	Ntho ea bohlokoa joale e ne e le ho fumana hore na ke mang.
I was hurt because of it.	Ke utloile bohloko ka lebaka la eona.
No one sat back.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a lula morao.
I never did it again, I never intended to do it again.	Ha kea e etsa hape, ke ne ke sa rera ho e etsa hape.
But my father is still drinking it.	Empa ntate o ntse a e noa.
But this is not important.	Empa sena ha se bohlokoa.
We can't stay here.	Re ke ke ra lula mona.
I'll just go home.	Ke tla ea hae feela.
Or there would be nothing.	Kapa ho ka be ho se na letho.
You are worth more than anything.	U bohlokoa ho feta eng kapa eng.
Do what you want.	Etsa seo u se batlang.
Even the girl did not have it.	Le ngoanana o ne a se na eona.
Every day after work.	Letsatsi le letsatsi ka mor'a mosebetsi.
He left the party early in the morning.	O ile a tloha moketeng esale hoseng.
We can do this together.	Re ka etsa sena hammoho.
You need to go.	U hloka ho tsamaea.
Until he did it again.	Ho fihlela o entse hape.
Yes, it does not.	E, ha ho etsahala.
Before starting work, he cleaned the room.	Pele a qala mosebetsi, o ile a lokisa kamore.
We love you.	Rea u rata.
Or so it seemed.	Kapa ke kamoo ho neng ho bonahala kateng.
I could not find a way to offer this.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho fumana mokhoa oa ho fana ka sena.
We do nothing like that.	Ha re etse letho la mofuta oo.
Of course he was not sure.	Ehlile o ne a se na bonnete.
He was just thankful that it was.	O ile a leboha feela hore ebe ho joalo.
You can help, too.	O ka thusa, le wena.
Let me see you up close.	E re ke u bone haufi.
We are still there.	Re ntse re le teng.
And as powerful as one.	'Me le matla joaloka e mong.
And now, he's gone.	Mme jwale, o ile.
Yes, read that again.	E, bala seo hape.
I want to play.	Ke batla ho bapala.
I don't see it happening.	Ha ke e bone e etsahala.
We treat only the first ones.	Re tšoara ba pele feela.
Invisible.	Ho sa bonahale.
It will happen soon.	E tla etsahala kapele.
I would buy here.	Ke ne ke tla reka mona.
We have so much time.	Re na le nako e ngata haholo.
But this was even worse.	Empa sena se ne se le mpe le ho feta.
Eventually you got everything you ever wanted.	Qetellong u ne u fumana tsohle tseo u kileng ua li batla.
This is my job.	Ona ke mosebetsi oa ka.
You learn it as a whole.	U ithuta eona e le ntho e le 'ngoe.
They look really good.	Li shebahala hantle haholo.
He had something.	O ne a ena le ho hong.
This is a simple fact of the matter.	Ena ke 'nete e bonolo ea taba.
They were his friends.	E ne e le metsoalle ea hae.
And that worked.	Mme seo se ile sa sebetsa.
However I am tired.	Leha ho le joalo ke khathetse.
Try a few things and find what you like.	Leka lintho tse 'maloa' me u fumane seo u se ratang.
I understand why that would happen.	Kea utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha seo se ne se tla etsahala.
I thought you knew better than that.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tseba betere ho feta moo.
That could happen, he realized.	Seo se ka etsahala, o ile a hlokomela.
He would not have left it.	A ka be a sa ka a e tlohela.
His hands reached out to me.	Matsoho a hae a fihla ho 'na.
You can only live it.	O ka e phela feela.
Thank you.	Kea leboha.
Outside, he stood up.	Ka ntle, a ema.
This is your job.	Ona ke mosebetsi oa hau.
The shy boy did not speak.	Moshanyana ea lihlong ha aa ka a bua.
Note this.	Hlokomela ena.
I can read anywhere.	Nka bala kae kapa kae.
I took something.	Ke nkile ho hong.
He worked hard to become a doctor.	O ile a sebetsa ka thata hore e be ngaka.
He was arrested several times.	O ile a tšoaroa ka makhetlo a 'maloa.
You will not allow it.	U ke ke ua e lumella.
She looked at him quickly.	A mo sheba kapele.
You could not.	U ne u ke ke ua khona.
Children do not need to go to school.	Bana ha ba hloke ho kena sekolo.
Or something.	Kapa ho na le ntho e itseng.
But we.	Empa rona .
We will pass his house.	Re tla feta ha hae.
And the boy is mine.	Mme moshanyana ke wa ka.
One more thing, though.	Ntho e 'ngoe hape, leha ho le joalo.
Are you all right? ' 	Na u hantle?'
I think they could have fixed it better, much easier.	Ke nahana hore ba ne ba ka e lokisa hantle, ha bonolo haholo.
So that's not a problem here.	Kahoo ha se bothata mona.
I do the same.	Le ’na ke etsa se tšoanang.
Now he is here.	Jwale o teng mona.
And this time.	Mme nakong ena.
So will I.	Le nna ke tla ba jwalo.
That it was still a family.	Hore e ne e ntse e le lelapa.
It does not want to talk.	Ha e batle ho bua.
He said a lot about this.	O ne a bolela lintho tse ngata ka sena.
For what my opinion is.	Bakeng sa seo maikutlo a ka a leng sona.
Do you get it now.	Na ua e fumana hona joale.
Everyone was busy with clothes.	Batho bohle ba ne ba ntse ba phathahane ka liaparo.
No, it is something.	Che, ke ntho e itseng.
It's not the same thing.	Ha se ntho e le 'ngoe.
It seemed like a very bad decision.	Ho bonahala eka e ne e le qeto e mpe haholo.
You haven't done anything yet.	Ha o so etse letho.
It was fun, too, once.	E ne e le monate, hape, hang.
I want you to know that you are not alone.	Ke batla hore u tsebe hore ha u mong.
I knew it was painful.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ho bohloko.
The team arrived quickly.	Sehlopha se ile sa fihla kapele.
Me or them.	Nna kapa bona.
Please, one comment per person.	Ka kopo, maikutlo a le mong ho motho ka mong.
In fact, we have both.	Ka 'nete, re na le bobeli le.
It allows us to be that way.	E re lumella ho ba joalo.
But you can't.	Empa u ke ke ua khona.
They only played one time before quitting.	Ba ile ba bapala nako e le 'ngoe feela pele ba tlohela.
I needed to go.	Ke ne ke hloka ho tsamaea.
And for them.	Le bakeng sa bone.
I don't know why, but we did.	Ha ke tsebe lebaka, empa re ile ra tseba.
He didn't even want to be out of it.	O ne a sa batle le ho ba ka ntle ho eona.
So do your best for them.	Kahoo etsa molemo ka ho fetisisa ho bona.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
And that's what we were there for.	Mme ke seo re neng re le moo ka sona.
He saw what it was.	A bona seo e neng e le sona.
Because it will be fun.	Hobane ho tla ba monate.
Seeing people.	Ho bona batho.
This is your problem.	Bona ke bothata ba hau.
I love everything about her.	Ke rata tsohle ka eena.
His issue was there.	Taba ea hae e ne e le teng.
So nothing else.	Kahoo ha ho letho le leng.
We went to school together.	Re ne re kena sekolo hammoho.
I can't.	Ha ke khone.
Anything that is true is true in the present moment.	Ntho efe kapa efe eo e leng 'nete ke 'nete ka nako ea hona joale.
Try to go to bed early tonight.	Leka ho robala pele ho nako bosiung bona.
There must be others.	E tlameha ebe ho na le ba bang.
He worked hard for many years.	O ile a sebetsa ka thata ka lilemo tse ngata.
I understand the reason though.	Ke utloisisa lebaka leha ho le joalo.
They found the house empty.	Ba ile ba fumana ntlo e se na motho.
You must stay here with us.	U tlameha ho lula mona le rona.
But he could be healthy if he wanted to.	Empa o ne a ka phela hantle ha a batla.
We will never know what will happen.	Re ke ke ra tseba se tla etsahala.
He sees the danger in it.	O bona kotsi ea eona.
I did not apply.	Ha kea etsa kopo.
But somehow it doesn't matter.	Empa ka tsela e itseng ha ho na taba.
He wanted to trust her.	O ne a batla ho mo tšepa.
We will take care of it.	Re tla e hlokomela.
Maybe this is true of it.	Mohlomong sena se na le 'nete ho sona.
The children have nothing, nothing.	Bana ha ba na letho, ha ho letho.
The same person was present repairing.	Motho ea tšoanang o ne a le teng a ntse a lokisa.
We do not discuss this subject at breakfast.	Ha re bue ka taba ena nakong ea lijo tsa hoseng.
I had to earn this money.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho fumana chelete ena.
You know that this is true.	Ua tseba hore sena ke 'nete.
Then he opened it.	Eaba oa e bula.
It works very well.	E sebetsa hantle haholo.
He too had no money.	Le eena o ne a se na chelete.
It's hard to do it again.	Ho thata ho e etsa hape.
We need to find them all here.	Re hloka ho li fumana kaofela mona.
I did not know it.	Ke ne ke sa e tsebe.
She is busy with her problems.	O phathahane ka mathata a hae.
These are his children.	Bana ke bana ba hae.
You know the name.	Le tseba lebitso.
He understood very well.	O ne a utloisisa hantle.
They were not in danger.	Ba ne ba e-s'o be kotsing.
To an adult.	Ho motho e moholo.
I love this room.	Ke rata kamore ena.
This worked well.	Sena se ne se sebetsa hantle.
I'm not sure what that means.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na hoo ho bolela eng.
However, that was just about the same picture.	Leha ho le joalo, hoo e ne e le feela ka setšoantšo se tšoanang.
I knew him a little bit.	Ke ne ke mo tseba hanyane.
But somehow, this seemed even worse.	Empa ka tsela e itseng, sena se ne se bonahala se le mpe le ho feta.
Find out.	Fumana.
I wanted to see the whole thing.	Ke ne ke batla ho bona ntho eo kaofela.
Many of the things he said were true.	Lintho tse ngata tseo a li buileng e ne e le ’nete.
Probably as simple as that.	Mohlomong e bonolo joalo ka eona.
The phone was ringing.	Mohala o ne o ntse o lla.
And he knew that.	Mme o ne a tseba seo.
You need good shoes.	U hloka lieta tse ntle.
He thought and thought.	A nahana le ho nahana.
And then you think you are nothing but him.	'Me joale u nahana hore ha u letho ntle le eena.
That would pass.	Seo se ne se tla feta.
We have never had a situation like this before.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra ba le boemo bo kang bona.
I live a very happy life.	Ke phela bophelo bo monate haholo.
He says, get out of here.	O re, tsoa mona.
You are a young man now and it is time for you to decide on these things.	U mohlankana joale 'me ke nako ea hore u nke qeto ka lintho tsena.
As soon as he left, the matter started again.	Hang ka mor'a hore a tsamaee, taba e ile ea qala hape.
Almost anyone who has ever visited here liked it.	Hoo e ka bang mang kapa mang ea kileng a etela mona o ile a e rata.
He will come here.	O tla tla mona.
Probably just so.	Mohlomong ho joalo feela.
It has its place.	E na le sebaka sa eona.
I don't think about him.	Ha ke nahane ka eena.
I told her not to ask again.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore a se ke a hlola a botsa.
It may be the last mistake you make.	E ka nna ya eba phoso ya ho qetela eo o e etsang.
It's easy to do.	Ho bonolo ho e etsa.
This made us a little nervous.	Sena se ile sa etsa hore re be le hlooho hanyane.
They were in front too.	Ba ne ba le ka pele hape.
But that is how it happened.	Empa ke kamoo e etsahetseng kateng.
It is also true.	Hape ke 'nete.
I feel very good.	Ke ikutloa hantle haholo.
He paused as they decided what to do next.	O ile a ema ha ba ntse ba etsa qeto ea hore na ba etse eng ka mor'a moo.
Whatever he said, that's his business.	Eng kapa eng eo a e buileng, ke taba ea hae.
And so on.	Joalo joalo.
For me it was like that.	Ho 'na ho ne ho le joalo.
They did it again this year.	Ba e entse hape selemong sena.
Maybe we should understand that.	Mohlomong re lokela ho utloisisa seo.
What is that?	Ke eng hoo?
But even that did not help.	Empa le hoo ha hoa thusa letho.
It did not have to be complicated.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale ho ba thata.
I knew it was his phone.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ke mohala oa hae.
must be.	ho joalo.
He did not want to keep her.	O ne a sa batle ho mo boloka.
We have these books at our school.	Re na le libuka tsena sekolong sa rona.
He had to think.	O ile a tlameha hore re nahane.
It really is for people who think they are tough.	Ha e le hantle ke bakeng sa batho ba nahanang hore ba thata.
Kids love that thing.	Bana ba rata ntho eo.
I wanted to give you a head start.	Ke ne ke batla ho u fa hlooho.
I want to be something.	Ke batla ho ba ntho e itseng.
Now there was nothing that it was supposed to be.	Joale ho ne ho se letho le neng le le kamoo le neng le lokela ho ba kateng.
It was just.	E ne e le feela.
Humans cannot live.	Batho ha ba khone ho phela.
We saw it last week.	Re e bone bekeng e fetileng.
This was too much.	Sena se ne se le ngata haholo.
Everyone does that, often.	E mong le e mong o etsa joalo, hangata.
I try one thing, and then another.	Ke leka ntho e 'ngoe, ebe e 'ngoe.
Everyone should know that by now.	E mong le e mong o lokela ho tseba seo ha jwale.
And don’t expect it to be easy.	'Me u se ke ua lebella hore ho tla ba bonolo.
But that's where you have it.	Empa ke moo u nang le eona.
We tend to say it as it is.	Re tloaetse ho e bolela joalo ka ha e le joalo.
No one will watch.	Ha ho motho ea tla shebella.
He would not be able to achieve this.	O ne a ke ke a khona ho fihlela sena.
He needed life.	O ne a hloka bophelo.
We were in the morning.	Re ne re le hoseng.
If you want to go, you have to go.	Haeba u batla ho tsamaea, u tlameha ho tsamaea.
There are several problems.	Ho na le mathata a 'maloa.
He could not find her.	Ha a ka a mo fumana.
However, it was not a problem.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ea ka ea ba bothata.
Some of us have.	Ba bang ba rōna ba kile ba etsa joalo.
I want to know one more thing.	Ke batla ho tseba ntho e le 'ngoe hape.
What do you do?	U etsa eng?
I know people who want that.	Ke tseba batho ba batlang seo.
That was my thought.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo oa ka.
She looked at her husband.	A sheba monna wa hae.
So be careful what you say!	Kahoo hlokomela seo u se buang!
But at the end of the day it's the man.	Empa qetellong ea letsatsi ke monna eo.
Then work outdoors.	Ebe u sebetsa ka ntle.
So, really.	Kahoo, 'nete.
He decided that it was his fault too.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore le eena ke molato oa hae.
I wanted to make sure you understood.	Ke ne ke batla ho etsa bonnete ba hore oa utloisisa.
But it seemed to be true.	Empa ho ne ho bonahala e le ’nete.
I did not like seeing them so close.	Ke ne ke sa rate ho ba bona ba le haufi hakaalo.
I am tired after a long time in this job.	Ke khathetse ka mor'a nako e telele mosebetsing ona.
It still is.	Ho ntse ho le joalo.
It can't do that.	E ke ke ea etsa joalo.
None of these things are true.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea lintho tsena eo e leng 'nete.
He worked as hard as anyone else worked hard.	O ne a sebetsa ka thata joalo ka ha motho e mong le e mong a sebetsa ka thata.
These are his people.	Bana ke batho ba hae.
But it is not good.	Empa ha ho molemo.
I do not believe in any of it.	Ha ke lumele letho la eona.
Tell your friends.	Bolella metsoalle ea hau.
Of course, it is not wrong.	Ha e le hantle, ha e na phoso.
You have been there.	U bile teng.
As it is not so difficult.	Joalo ka ha ho thata hakaalo.
I sat there and watched something bad.	Ke ile ka lula moo 'me ka shebella ntho e mpe.
No one is going to fix it.	Ha ho motho ea tla e lokisa.
Somewhere too far.	Sebakeng se seng haholo.
Isn't that right?	Na ha ho joalo?
Don't let them cry!	U se ke ua li lumella ho u lla!
He was probably arrested.	Mohlomong o ne a tšoeroe.
I could just do some of that.	Nka mpa ka etsa tse ling tsa tseo.
Do you know where this was going?	Na ua tseba hore na see se ne se le hokae?
I know, life is hard for you.	Kea tseba, bophelo bo thata ho uena.
I will go and see him.	Ke tla ea ho mo bona.
One for my son, and the other for my life.	E 'ngoe ho mora oa ka,' me e 'ngoe e bua ka bophelo ba ka.
We all have one.	Kaofela re na le e le 'ngoe.
Bad news.	Litaba tse mpe.
It's a very strange thing.	Ke ntho e makatsang haholo.
This place is his.	Sebaka sena ke hae.
Then he did not have to ask.	Joale o ne a sa tlameha ho botsa.
I do nothing with you when you are not.	Ha ke etse letho le uena ha u joalo.
His friends ate until he could no longer eat.	Metsoalle ea hae e ile ea ja ho fihlela e se e sa khone ho ja.
You need this.	U hloka sena.
It would have been much easier.	Ho ka be ho bile bonolo haholo.
He saw things that were missing.	O ile a bona lintho tse sieo.
Books were always valuable.	Libuka li ne li lula li le bohlokoa.
I didn't care how long it took.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle hore na ho nkile nako e kae.
I know the mind is very bad.	Kea tseba hore kelello e mpe haholo.
Then go back.	Joale khutlela morao.
Just trying to understand how.	Ho leka feela ho utloisisa hore na joang.
However, he stayed there.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a lula moo.
Probably a long time ago.	Mohlomong khale.
Nobody understood what he was saying.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a utloisisa seo a se buileng.
Something wonderful is happening there.	Ho etsahala ntho e makatsang moo.
I convinced her.	Ke ile ka mo kholisa.
Level 2	Boemo ba bobeli
We heard very well.	Re utloile hantle haholo.
However, she was not a doctor, it was her mother.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se ngaka, e ne e le ’mè oa hae.
I did not see you there.	Ha kea u bona moo.
It was so beautiful.	E ne e le ntle haholo.
This takes a lot of time.	Sena se nka nako e ngata.
I walked out of my room and saw you.	Ke ile ka tsoa ka kamoreng ea ka 'me ka u bona.
I still realize that even more.	Ke ntse ke hlokomela seo le ho feta.
To me, she was beautiful.	Ho nna, o ne a le motle.
The decision may be final.	Qeto e ka ba ea ho qetela.
Many of them do.	Ba bangata ba bona ba etsa joalo.
Instead it saw an opportunity.	Ho e-na le hoo e ile ea bona monyetla.
The man had done it for a reason.	Monna eo o ne a e entse ka lebaka.
I wear it sometimes.	Ke e apara ka linako tse ling.
No, it is not.	Che, ha se eona.
Maybe that's what he would do.	Mohlomong ke sona seo a neng a tla se etsa.
When he left.	Ha a tsamaea.
She could feel his hair touching her.	O ne a utloa a mo tšoara moriri.
But we will see how it will be if they try.	Empa re tla bona hore na ho tla ba joang haeba ba ka leka.
This is the most difficult question.	Ena ke potso e thata ka ho fetisisa.
And they might finish it tonight.	Mme ba ka nna ba e qeta bosiung bona.
Stay with them.	Dula le bona.
He had found it.	O ne a e fumane.
I could not live any longer.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho phela ho feta moo.
You probably know him.	Mohlomong ua mo tseba.
I need to call other people.	Ke hloka ho letsetsa batho ba bang.
I want to feel that way too.	Ke batla ho ikutloa ka tsela eo hape.
It is just as important as all the others.	E bohlokoa joalo ka tse ling kaofela.
I don't like him anymore.	Ha ke sa mo rata.
The food is very tasty here.	Lijo li monate haholo mona.
She could not look at him as he spoke.	O ne a sitoa ho mo sheba ha a ntse a bua.
it is actually weird ???.	ha e le hantle ke ntho e makatsang ???.
They talked for a long time.	Ba ile ba bua nako e telele.
Of course, one can do that.	Ha e le hantle, motho a ka etsa joalo.
That is what we want them to do.	Ke seo re batlang hore ba se etse.
He loves her.	O a mo rata.
He had a life.	O ne a na le bophelo.
Perhaps his wife has similar problems.	Mohlomong mosali oa hae o na le mathata a tšoanang.
That's wrong.	Ke phoso.
Next week is your turn.	Bekeng e tlang ke nako ea hau.
But he was very good to her.	Empa o ne a le molemo haholo bakeng sa hae.
That’s how my mind would work.	Ke kamoo kelello ea ka e neng e tla sebetsa kateng.
That's a good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle eo.
You are still a child as you were.	O ntse o le ngoana joalo ka ha o ne o le teng.
May we always do so.	E se eka re ka etsa joalo kamehla.
We have enough of our own.	Re na le tsa rona tse lekaneng.
There was nothing we needed to give.	Ho ne ho se letho leo re neng re hloka ho fana ka lona.
I just have to be better.	Ke tlameha ho ba betere feela.
I was not there.	Ke ne ke le sieo.
I want you to do it.	Ke batla hore o e etse.
Happy times indeed !.	Linako tse monate ka 'nete!.
Without thinking, he started again.	Ntle le ho nahana, o ile a qala hape.
He doesn't think so.	Ha a nahane joalo.
Have a good time, of course.	E-ba le nako e monate, ehlile.
Stand next to your husband.	Ema haufi le monna oa hau.
I had never seen anyone like them before.	Ke ne ke qala ho bona ba tšoanang le bona.
He did not know her.	O ne a sa mo tsebe.
Finding a job was not easy.	Ho fumana mosebetsi ho ne ho se bonolo.
I know he was there.	Kea tseba hore o ne a le teng.
He still could not see the police car.	O ne a ntse a sa bone koloi ea mapolesa.
It's just my opinion.	Ke maikutlo a ka feela.
They said yes.	Ba ile ba re ho joalo.
What they probably did.	Seo mohlomong ba se entseng.
Dressing and making dinner.	Ho apara le ho etsa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
We must stand, speak and speak.	Re tlameha ho ema, re bue le ho bua.
If you want to do something harder than get something else.	Haeba u batla ho etsa ntho e thata ho feta fumana ntho e 'ngoe.
It can't be good.	E ke ke ea e-ba ntle.
However, this seemed very close to that.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se ne se bonahala se le haufi haholo le seo.
No one tried.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a leka.
Don't play with your food!	Se ke oa bapala ka lijo tsa hau!
You don't, you don't have time.	Ha o etse, ha o na nako.
It was not the time to know.	E ne e se nako ea ho tseba.
That's all.	Ho joalo feela.
He was still very much alive.	O ne a ntse a phela haholo.
He did not know where he was.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na o hokae.
Yes it is.	Ee e joalo.
See how many you can think of.	Bona hore na u ka nahana ka tse kae.
Without him, it was all there was to it.	Ka ntle ho eena, e ne e le sohle se neng se le teng.
Today, no one is crazy.	Kajeno, ha ho motho ea nang le kelello.
The evening was gone.	Mantsiboea a ne a se a ile.
Maybe they would be right about that.	Mohlomong ba ne ba tla ba hantle ka seo.
It is not enough.	Ha hoa lekana.
But.	Empa.
I need to get out of this.	Ke hloka ho tsoa ho sena.
Work is progressing well.	Mosebetsi o ntse o tsoela pele hantle.
It's a simple matter.	Taba e bonolo.
She feels guilty about what she did.	O ikutloa a le molato ka seo a se entseng.
However, very early.	Leha ho le joalo, pele haholo.
I gave him the money.	Ke ile ka mo fa chelete.
So far it is very easy.	Ho fihlela joale ho bonolo haholo.
I am very close.	Ke haufi haholo.
The door was hard but.	Lemati le ne le le thata empa .
It happens, it does.	Hoa etsahala, ho joalo.
And often it is.	Mme hangata ho jwalo.
He began to think about walking.	O ile a qala ho nahana ka ho tsamaea.
They need us now.	Ba re hloka hona joale.
And his life.	Le bophelo ba hae.
My father did not trust her.	Ntate ha a ka a mo tšepa.
I will not.	nke ke ka etsa joalo.
Then he said he was older than you.	Eaba o re o moholo ho uena.
These are difficult issues to understand.	Tsena ke litaba tse thata ho utloisisa.
You can find it fun.	U ka fumana ho le monate.
Just like you.	Joalo feela ka uena.
Of course, you can do this a few hours ahead of time.	Ehlile, u ka etsa sena lihora tse 'maloa pele ho nako.
He loved them too.	Le eena o ne a li rata.
You will see that.	O tla bona seo.
We can go somewhere.	Re ka ea sebakeng se seng.
I do not understand.	Ha ke utloisise.
You know, as you like.	Ua tseba, joalo ka ha u rata.
Therefore, it was difficult to do so.	Ka hona, ho ne ho le thata ho etsa joalo.
That's exactly what he said.	Ke hantle seo a se buileng.
He called again.	A letsa hape.
We saw nothing.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bona letho.
Now it is very easy.	Hona joale ho bonolo haholo.
To some, that may be true.	Leha ho ba bang seo e ka 'na ea e-ba 'nete.
The place is empty.	Sebaka ha se na letho.
I needed one.	Ke ne ke hloka e 'ngoe.
I'm glad I visited here.	Ke thabetse hore ebe ke ile ka etela mona.
I would not do that.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa joalo.
But today we will do the same.	Empa kajeno re tla etsa sona seo.
He has a lot of things he loves.	O na le lintho tse ngata tseo a li ratang.
Or it could be.	Kapa ho ka ba joalo.
But they are not just humans.	Empa hase batho feela.
I felt that they treated us as family members.	Ke ne ke utloa eka ba re tšoara joaloka ba bang ba lelapa.
Of course we do not know why he went.	Ha e le hantle ha re tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ea.
I thought of the house.	Ke ile ka nahana ka ntlo.
Don't think you are looking at it.	U se ke ua nahana hore ua e sheba.
And no one came to visit us.	Mme ha ho motho ya ileng a re etela.
Consider my suggestion.	Nahana ka tlhahiso ea ka.
They refused three times.	Ba ile ba hana ka makhetlo a mararo.
He could have seen it coming, of course.	A ka be a e bone e tla, ehlile.
It keeps them alive.	E ba boloka ba phela.
So the people return to them.	Kahoo batho ba khutlela ho bona.
They refuse to pay for it.	Ba hana ho e lefa.
There are certainly some of those times.	Ka sebele ho na le tse ling tsa linako tseo.
Did you know that they exist.	Na u ne u tseba hore li teng.
But really, it could be anything.	Empa ha e le hantle, e ka ba eng kapa eng.
If anyone can help, it can be fun.	Haeba mang kapa mang a ka thusa, ho ka ba monate.
What happened to you was real.	Se etsahetseng ho uena e ne e le sa sebele.
I stared at him for a very long time.	Ke ile ka mo sheba nako e telele haholo.
He asked if she wanted to go with him.	O ile a botsa hore na o batla ho tsamaea le eena.
He never does that.	Ha ho mohla a etsang joalo.
Decide what you want.	Etsa qeto ea hore na u batla eng.
He wanted to live as a human.	O ne a batla ho phela joaloka motho.
However, it is difficult to do many good things.	Leha ho le joalo, ho thata ho etsa lintho tse ngata hantle.
No one here has ever seen a car.	Ha ho motho mona ea kileng a bona koloi.
I can no longer live like that.	Ha ke sa khona ho phela joalo.
Sometimes we just walk away.	Ka linako tse ling re tsamaea feela.
It is family life.	Ke bophelo ba lelapa.
Now it was her turn.	Joale e ne e le nako ea hae.
Do not say anything unless you have to, and do nothing until it is necessary.	U se ke ua bua letho ntle le haeba u tlameha, 'me u se ke ua etsa letho ho fihlela ho hlokahala.
He refuses to give her any money and leaves.	O hana ho mo fa chelete leha e le efe 'me oa tsamaea.
Now it's up to you.	Jwale ho ho wena.
But it went beyond that.	Empa ho ile ha feta moo.
We do not make this important.	Ha re etse sena bohlokoa.
The work did not take longer than it seemed.	Mosebetsi ha oa ka oa nka nako e telele ho feta kamoo o neng o bonahala kateng.
He had his best days.	O bile le matsatsi a hae a monate.
This should never happen again, everyone said.	Sena ha sea lokela ho etsahala hape, bohle ba re.
He is present now.	O teng hona joale.
I had to pass for them.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho feta bakeng sa bona.
No, that's not true.	Che, ha se 'nete hantle.
That way people will eventually see the truth.	Ka tsela eo qetellong batho ba tla bona ’nete.
No one knows why or how.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na ke hobane'ng kapa joang.
Then that was fun.	Joale seo se ne se le monate.
I'd like to try it out.	Ke kopa ho leka.
He gave us a very nice place.	O ile a re fa sebaka se setle haholo.
He wanted her.	O ne a mo batla.
Come back to me.	Khutlela ho 'na.
You need to sleep.	O lokela ho robala.
This was very difficult for him.	Sena se ne se le boima haholo ho eena.
He was not in danger.	O ne a se kotsing.
We have to find him.	Re tlameha ho mo fumana.
But we love it that way.	Empa re e rata joalo.
He began to be absent.	O ile a qala ho se be teng.
We decided to let them go.	Re ile ra etsa qeto ea ho ba tlohela.
When he heard this, the father began to cry.	Ha a utloa litaba tseo, ntate eo a qala ho lla.
He thought so of us.	O ne a nahana joalo ka rōna.
All but one except you.	Bohle ntle le e mong ntle le uena.
People want something real.	Batho ba batla ntho ea sebele.
It was hard to hear.	Ho ne ho le thata ho utloa.
He stayed with me for several years.	O ile a lula le ’na ka lilemo tse ’maloa.
He is something close to you.	O ntho e haufi le wena.
He wouldn't need it here.	A ka be a sa e hloke mona.
After that, things get even worse.	Ka mor'a moo, lintho li ba thata le ho feta.
But this is even more important today.	Empa sena ke sa bohlokoa le ho feta kajeno.
You eat his old food.	U ja lijo tsa hae tsa khale.
So that gives you a place to start now.	Kahoo seo se u fa sebaka sa ho qala hona joale.
This work is in progress.	Mosebetsi ona o ntse o tsoela pele.
They wanted to play for me.	Ba ne ba batla ho bapala bakeng sa ka.
I wondered what was going on.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na ho etsahalang.
I could tell he loved her.	Ke ile ka bona hore oa mo rata.
Finally in, out first.	Qetellong ho kena, ho tsoa pele.
But there was no time.	Empa ho ne ho se nako.
This is what happens, in the end.	Sena ke se etsahalang, qetellong.
Sometimes we just look.	Ka linako tse ling re sheba feela.
I'll be there.	Ke tla moo.
However, go ahead.	Leha ho le joalo, tsoela pele.
I could not sleep all night.	Ha kea ka ka robala bosiu bohle.
Maybe you understand it all.	Mohlomong o e utloisisa kaofela.
Some of these things are difficult.	Tse ling tsa lintho tsena li thata.
I had no place for them.	Ke ne ke se na sebaka sa bona.
I am of no use to you.	Ha ke na thuso ho uena.
From.	Ho tloha.
It was not something he enjoyed.	E ne e se ntho eo a neng a e thabela.
Soon we find a place.	Haufinyane re fumana sebaka.
But some people may like this.	Empa batho ba bang ba ka rata sena.
He had to learn even more.	O ne a lokela ho ithuta ka matla le ho feta.
They are beautiful.	Li ntle.
But wait a minute.	Empa ema hanyane.
You may not know it, but we do.	Mohlomong u ke ke ua e tseba, empa rea ​​tseba.
We will not live with you until you do.	Re ke ke ra phela le uena ho fihlela u etsa joalo.
Probably not that way.	Mohlomong ho ne ho sa etsahala ka tsela eo.
He can tell you.	A ka o bolella.
Some decided to stay.	Ba bang ba ile ba etsa qeto ea ho lula.
What was it.	E ne e le eng.
You would not be able to pass this opportunity.	U ne u ke ke ua khona ho tlohela monyetla ona.
And you can see it too.	Mme le wena o ka e bona.
He never mentions the past.	Ha ho mohla a buang nakong e fetileng.
Like you.	Joalo ka uena.
I never found that easy.	Ha kea ka ka fumana seo se le bonolo hakaalo.
They were too heavy for him.	Li ne li le boima haholo ho eena.
Finally, he spoke again.	Qetellong, o ile a bua hape.
You usually have to start small.	Hangata u tlameha ho qala hanyane.
I did not want to see them.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho bona.
He would like to be here today.	O ne a ka rata ho ba mona kajeno.
Too bad error.	Phoso e mpe haholo.
It takes some people a long time to understand things.	Ho nka batho ba bang nako e telele ho utloisisa lintho.
It would not be the last.	E ne e ke ke ea e-ba oa ho qetela.
You will never have to do that.	Le ka mohla u ke ke ua tlameha ho etsa joalo.
There are several things you need.	Ho na le lintho tse 'maloa tseo u li hlokang.
That's the law.	Ke molao.
He knows exactly where.	O tseba hantle moo.
Your name.	Lebitso la hau.
This is a phone call.	Ena ke mohala.
Or to keep the law.	Kapa ho boloka molao.
Other than that, nothing was as it was last year.	Ntle ho moo, ha ho letho le neng le le ka tsela eo ho neng ho le ka eona selemong se fetileng.
It is as bad as anything.	E mpe joalo ka eng kapa eng.
He wants to deny that.	O batla ho hana seo.
I love you so much.	Ke u rata haholo.
I knew that would not be enough.	Ke ne ke tseba hore hoo ho ke ke ha lekana.
I knew what it was going to be.	Ke ne ke tseba hore na e tla ba eng.
You know what we want.	U tseba seo re se batlang.
It was so.	Ho ne ho le joalo.
I allow it to do so.	Ke e lumella ho etsa joalo.
This will be very difficult.	Sena se tla ba thata haholo.
That is not enough.	Seo ha sea lekana.
It made me think.	E entse hore ke nahane.
Meet me tonight.	Kopana le nna bosiung bona.
You are tired, yes.	U khathetse, e.
But someone noticed, and they fixed it.	Empa e mong o ile a hlokomela, mme ba e lokisa.
It is very easy to reason.	Ho bonolo haholo ho lebaka.
Nothing helped.	Ha ho letho le ileng la thusa.
He decided he must be tired.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore e tlameha ebe o khathetse.
However, I am not sure how I can get it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka e fumana joang.
It was so much fun.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo.
After a long search, we found it.	Ka mor’a ho e batla nako e telele, re ile ra e fumana.
It is this way.	Ho ka tsela ena.
He begins to find a way.	O qala ho fumana tsela.
You do it because it catches you.	U e etsa hobane e u tšoara.
But they do too.	Empa le bona ba etsa joalo.
He would keep it that way.	O ne a tla e boloka e le joalo.
And such will certainly come.	Mme ba jwalo ruri ba tla tla.
No one needed to think about it.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale hore motho a nahane ka hona.
They are very powerful.	Li matla haholo.
They left early in the morning for the party.	Ba ile ba tloha hoseng ho ea moketeng.
More often than not, they do not even think.	Hangata ho feta moo, ha ba nahane le ho nahana.
I will not be able to go with you today.	Nke ke ka khona ho tsamaea le uena kajeno.
But this looks good.	Empa sena se shebahala hantle.
Then go with you.	Joale tsamaea le uena.
My parents had never met anyone who did these other things.	Batsoali ba ka ba ne ba e-s’o ka ba kopana le motho ea etsang lintho tsena tse ling.
And we need them urgently.	'Me re li hloka kapele.
Go further.	Tsamaea ho feta.
They know what they are doing.	Ba tseba seo ba se etsang.
I saw them.	Ke ba bone.
The morning came and they did not find her.	Hoseng ha fihla mme ba ne ba eso mo fumane.
Water was very important.	Metsi e ne e le a bohlokoa haholo.
Once again, it is absolutely not true.	Hang hape, ho hang hase 'nete.
Again, nothing happened.	Hape, ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala.
That will surely help.	Ka sebele seo se tla thusa.
There was a bad mistake.	Ho ne ho e-na le phoso e mpe.
It will be so.	Ho tla ba jwalo.
You work very well with it.	U sebetsa hantle haholo ka eona.
He will probably never forget it.	Mohlomong a ke ke a lebala.
I was already too late.	Ke ne ke se ke le morao haholo.
Leave with you now.	Tloha le uena joale.
He made a surprising comment.	O ile a fana ka maikutlo a makatsang.
Do not go to talk to them.	O seke wa ya bua le bona.
But it will come soon.	Empa e tla fihla haufinyane.
In fact, she cried.	Ha e le hantle, o ile a lla.
So in this way he kept working hard.	Kahoo ka tsela ena o ile a ’na a sebetsa ka thata.
As a father as a child.	Joalo ka ntate joalo ka ngoana.
He refused to talk to me.	O ne a hana ho bua le nna.
His parents did, too.	Batsoali ba hae ba ile ba etsa joalo, le bona.
If we live by this.	Haeba re phela ka sena.
It was fun.	Ho bile monate.
But it is there.	Empa e teng.
There is no way back.	Ha ho tsela ea ho khutla.
I want to help you with your pain.	Ke batla ho o thusa ka bohloko ba hao.
He wants to meet me.	O batla ho kopana le nna.
After three years there he returned home.	Ka mor'a lilemo tse tharo a le moo o ile a khutlela hae hape.
And there is a problem.	Mme ho na le bothata.
That mindset, that decision, belonged to another girl.	Kelello eo, qeto eo, e ne e le ea ngoanana e mong.
I want to get right there like that.	Ke batla ho fihlela hantle joalo ka moo.
He left.	O ile a tsamaea.
Anything can happen.	Ntho efe kapa efe e ka ba teng.
It was very simple.	E ne e le bonolo haholo.
I like to talk.	Ke rata ho bua.
You can go out and do your own thing.	U ka tsoa 'me ua etsa ntho ea hau feela.
But we did not have that time.	Mme re ne re sena nako eo.
They had never made the sun.	Ba ne ba eso etse letsatsi.
You may have problems.	O ka ba le mathata.
But they are outsiders.	Empa ke ba ka ntle.
I hear it.	Kea e utloa.
Of course, only one will start.	Ha e le hantle, e le 'ngoe feela e tla qala.
This is how the truth is.	Ena ke tsela eo 'nete e leng ka eona.
Here is a powerful overview of book production.	Mona ke tlhahiso e matla ea tlhahiso ea buka.
I don’t want to read, write more.	Ha ke batle ho bala, ho ngola ho feta.
I wonder what they do with it.	Kea ipotsa hore na ba etsa eng ka eona.
And another.	Le e 'ngoe.
In fact, you enjoy it more.	Ha e le hantle, u e thabela haholoanyane.
This was a strange first thing.	Ena e bile ntho e makatsang ea pele.
It was just dangerous.	E ne e le kotsi feela.
I had never told anyone.	Ke ne ke eso bolelle motho.
Get to know them before you meet them !.	Ba tsebe pele u kopana le bona!.
That's not fun.	Seo ha se monate.
I have never had a family.	Ha ke eso be le lelapa.
To this day, they have not.	Ho fihlela kajeno, ha ba e-s'o.
I need to help my team.	Ke hloka ho thusa sehlopha sa ka.
That is the point.	Taba ke eona eo.
We need to know what to do.	Re lokela ho tseba seo re lokelang ho se etsa.
I wanted money.	Ke ne ke batla chelete.
So we will continue to do more.	Kahoo re tla tsoela pele ho etsa ho feta moo.
I have been using them every day.	esale ke li sebelisa letsatsi le letsatsi.
But it works for me.	Empa oa sebetsa bakeng sa ka.
You know them.	Le ba tseba.
Just go there.	U mpe u ee moo.
They like to play a little.	Ba rata ho bapala hanyane.
And it really is for me.	Mme ehlile ke bakeng sa ka.
Of course some work is needed here.	Ehlile ho hlokahala mosebetsi o itseng mona.
The process is simple here.	Mokhoa ona o bonolo mona.
My mother had never had a sun.	'Mè o ne a e-s'o be le letsatsi.
he asked.	a botsa.
We have so many things to do in the morning.	Re na le lintho tse ngata tseo re lokelang ho li etsa hoseng.
What should you do?	U lokela ho etsa'ng?
It does him good at his job, of course.	E mo etsa hantle mosebetsing oa hae, ha e le hantle.
They are always good friends.	Ba lula e le metsoalle e molemo.
It's for work.	Ke tsa mosebetsi.
You knew you didn't care.	U ne u tseba hore ha u na taba.
We don't talk much.	Ha re bue hakaalo.
It is easy to find a place.	Ho bonolo ho fumana sebaka.
And sometimes when you have children, you eat fast.	'Me ka linako tse ling ha u e-na le bana, u ja kapele.
He will never do that.	Ha ho mohla a tla etsa joalo.
They were here.	Ba ne ba le teng mona.
Ask this simple question.	Botsa potso ena e bonolo.
This is their strength.	Sena ke matla a bona.
I say thank you.	Ke re kea leboha.
I play it with my ear.	Ke e bapala ka tsebe.
The doctor spent money on the problem.	Ngaka e ile ea sebelisa chelete ka bothata boo.
You need to sleep.	O lokela ho robala.
Keep talking to her.	Tsoela pele ho bua le eena.
It is easy to see why this is so.	Ho bonolo ho bona hore na ke hobane'ng ha sena se tlameha ho ba joalo.
Why, he didn't know.	Hobaneng, o ne a sa tsebe.
Eng! 	Eng!
she would cry.	o ne a tla lla.
So, we have to start now.	Kahoo, re tlameha ho qala hona joale.
I did not ask him.	Ha kea mo botsa.
It seemed like a good thing to him.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ke ntho e ntle ho eena.
He didn't care what happened to any of us.	O ne a sa tsotelle letho ka se etsahetseng ho mang kapa mang oa rona.
Do not expect to find any work today.	U se ke ua tšepa ho fumana mosebetsi ofe kapa ofe kajeno.
I see nothing wrong with it.	Ha ke bone letho le phoso.
This is hard work but it is necessary.	Ona ke mosebetsi o boima empa o hlokahala.
I'm trying to find a way to go.	Ke leka ho fumana tsela ea ho tsamaea.
No one else came in while he waited.	Ha ho motho e mong ea ileng a kena ha a ntse a emetse.
It really was a good thing for me.	Ruri e ne e le ntho e ntle ho nna.
There are three of them.	Ho na le tse tharo tsa tsona.
She usually reads in the morning.	Hangata o bala hoseng.
We will have to use it.	Re tla tlameha ho e sebelisa.
It's fun to drink.	Ho monate ho noa.
I want nothing.	Ha ke batle letho.
I love it that way.	Ke e rata ka tsela eo.
They no longer feel that way.	Ha ba sa ikutloa ka tsela eo.
But everyone knew what was happening.	Empa e mong le e mong o ne a tseba se etsahalang.
This is important.	Sena se bohlokoa.
You were going.	U ne u tsamaea.
So off he went.	Kahoo oa tsoa.
However, know that there is nothing to be afraid of.	Leha ho le joalo, tseba hore ha ho letho leo u lokelang ho le tšaba.
Yes, you may be in the front of the room.	E, u ka 'na ua ba ka pele ka kamoreng.
But they did not last long.	Empa ha baa ka ba tsoela pele ka nako e telele.
We went to our work.	Re ile ra ea mosebetsing oa rona.
They came again a week later.	Ba ile ba tla hape ka mor'a beke.
You are meeting real people.	U ntse u kopana le batho ba sebele.
It worked.	E ile ea sebetsa.
This was to be the place.	Sena e ne e lokela ho ba sebaka seo.
I'll give you a letter in the morning.	Ke tla u fa lengolo hoseng.
There was no one there.	Ho ne ho se na motho.
Her classmate.	Eo a neng a ithuta le eena sekolong.
They can't believe it.	Ha ba khone ho e lumela.
He will do the same in this matter.	O tla etsa joalo ka taba ena.
You will love this, it is so delicious.	U tla rata sena, se monate haholo.
I love it !.	Kea e rata!.
But they suggest.	Empa ba fana ka maikutlo.
I am never alone.	Ha ho mohla ke leng mong.
How do you know if you're happy?	U tseba joang hore u thabile?
None of them seemed to care.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se le ea mong oa tsona.
We can find them.	Re ka ba fumana.
Walking was difficult.	Ho tsamaea ka maoto ho ne ho le boima.
There was only one place.	Ho ne ho e-na le sebaka se le seng feela.
That person will not have children.	Motho eo a ke ke a ba le bana.
I realize that every day.	Ke hlokomela seo letsatsi le letsatsi.
Then you will come to live with us.	Joale u tla tla ho lula le rona.
It's his person.	Ke motho oa hae.
It has been a long time now.	E se e le nako e telele joale e le teng.
Without him, he would not have survived.	Ntle ho eena, o ne a ke ke a phela.
If this is the case, do so.	Haeba sena, etsa joalo.
They just have to get it.	Ba tlameha feela ho e fumana.
Some said they were only there for the money.	Ba bang o itse ba ne ba le ho eona feela bakeng sa chelete.
Well to.	Hantle ho.
But it is not that simple.	Empa ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
Then we left.	Eaba rea ​​tsamaea.
It met very quickly.	E ile ea kopana kapele haholo.
I spent some time.	Ke ile ka qeta nako e itseng.
Everyone was in danger.	E mong le e mong o ne a le kotsing.
The day started very early	Letsatsi le ile la qala haholo
Then, too late, he realized his danger.	Joale, e se e le morao haholo, o ile a hlokomela kotsi ea hae.
I need a job.	Ke hloka mosebetsi.
It comes from my parents and their parents before them.	E tsoa ho batsoali ba ka le batsoali ba bona pele ho bona.
He is a big, strong man.	Ke monna e moholo le ea matla.
And it does not appear.	'Me ha ho bonahale.
He never asked for it.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a e kopa.
He really wants to be with her.	O hlile o batla ho ba le eena.
It seemed like they had never existed before.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ha ba eso be teng pele.
He did not need to be with her.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale hore a be le eena.
That's it.	Ke seo.
And your suggestion is good.	'Me tlhahiso ea hau ke e ntle.
I would love to meet you.	Nka thabela ho kopana le wena.
Bosiung.	Bosiung.
Many more.	Tse ling tse ngata.
However, things are not that simple.	Leha ho le joalo, lintho ha li bonolo hakaalo.
It was something they wanted.	E ne e le ntho eo ba neng ba e batla.
It is not strong enough.	Ha se matla a lekaneng.
That really doesn't make sense.	Seo ha e le hantle ha se na kelello.
It has a simple feel to it.	E na le maikutlo a bonolo ho eona.
However, I am still doing better every day.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ntse ke sebetsa betere letsatsi ka leng.
But every type of bike comes.	Empa mofuta o mong le o mong oa baesekele o tla.
Everyone seemed to be waiting for this.	Ho bonahala eka bohle ba ne ba emetse sena.
They could always take my place if they wanted to.	Ba ne ba ka nka sebaka sa ka kamehla haeba ba batla.
I'm just telling you to talk to people.	Ke mpa ke u bolella hore u bue le batho.
My father made me leave.	Ntate o ile a etsa hore ke tsamaee.
I don't care how old he is.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na o lilemo li kae.
And maybe it was for you.	Mme mohlomong e ne e le bakeng sa hao.
Or you may want to do it.	Kapa u ka rata ho etsa.
He spoke to the boy.	A bua le moshanyana.
Sometimes he even enjoyed it.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a bile a e thabela.
It seems easy enough.	Ho bonahala ho le bonolo ho lekana.
Or someone else.	Kapa motho e mong.
, when they sleep.	, ha ba robala.
He could not find her soon enough.	O ne a sa khone ho mo fumana kapele ho lekana.
I really love him thank you so much !!.	Ke mo rata ruri ke leboha haholo!!.
I will definitely read it again.	Ruri ke tla e bala hape.
Of course we can't do anything like that.	Ehlile re ke ke ra etsa letho la mofuta oo.
Go away, young man.	Tloha, mohlankana.
But you can do that.	Empa u ka ba etsa joalo.
It helps to have someone to talk to.	Hoa thusa ho ba le motho eo u buang le eena.
Or don't do it, it's up to you.	Kapa u se etse, ho ho uena.
Some people went to help them at home.	Batho ba bang ba ile ba ya ba thusa hae.
Thank you for your hard work.	Kea le leboha ka mosebetsi oa lona o boima.
I can't read it all now.	Nke ke ka e bala kaofela ha jwale.
They want money, he thought.	Ba batla chelete, o ile a nahana joalo.
And you did not care about others.	'Me u ne u sa tsotelle ba bang.
No, wait a minute.	Che, ema hanyane.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
Another returned home.	E mong a khutlela hae.
You better not forget that.	Ho molemo o seke oa lebala seo.
She is tough.	O thata.
Is it a boy or a girl?	Ke moshanyana kapa ngoanana?
Thank you, son.	Kea leboha, mora.
This had the power to do it.	Sena se ne se e-na le matla a ho se etsa.
Mealtime.	Nako ea ho ja.
I do.	Ke etsa joalo.
So we stayed.	Kahoo re ile ra lula.
It was not something we had ever imagined.	E ne e se ntho eo re kileng ra e nahana.
Everyone who knew him knew the truth.	Bohle ba neng ba mo tseba ba ne ba tseba ’nete.
Nobody here can do that.	Ha ho motho mona ea ka etsang joalo.
You have never met this one.	Ha o so kopane le ena.
What is it.	Ke eng e joalo.
Or, you may want it.	Kapa, ​​u ka e batla.
There was still something they had to do.	Ho ne ho ntse ho e-na le seo ba neng ba lokela ho se etsa.
It can be fun.	Ho ka ba monate.
I think you did.	Ke nahana hore u entse joalo.
I've never seen you.	Ha ke eso o bone.
Most of the people here are very nice.	Batho ba bangata mona ba ntle haholo.
I needed to talk to you.	Ke ne ke hloka ho bua le uena.
My children eat.	Bana ba ka ba ja.
It finally came to him.	Qetellong ea fihla ho eena.
But it's gone now.	Empa e ile jwale.
But she did not know him.	Empa ha a ka a mo tseba.
That is my daily routine.	Eo ke mokhoa oa ka oa letsatsi le letsatsi.
He never mentioned the matter.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka taba ena.
But you really have to do what you think is right.	Empa ehlile o tlameha ho etsa kamoo o nahanang hantle.
Good, but not very good if you do not have a car.	E ntle, empa ha e ntle haholo haeba u sena koloi.
He looked from one to the other.	A sheba ho tloha ho e mong ho ya ho e mong.
He did not have to ask if he saw a need.	O ne a sa tlameha ho botsa hore na o bona ho hlokahala.
He gets power from it.	O fumana matla ho eona.
We can win.	Re ka hlola.
He was not a good man at all.	E ne e se monna e motle.
Although it may take years.	Leha ho ka nka lilemo.
He talked about his son.	O ile a bua ka mora oa hae.
Some people are happy.	Batho ba bang ba thabile.
Are you a man or a woman?	Na u monna kapa u mosali?
That is what you wanted and that is what you will get.	Ke seo o neng o se batla mme ke seo o tla se fumana.
And one has to spend money to make money.	'Me motho o tlameha ho sebelisa chelete ho etsa chelete.
We just want a name.	Re mpa re batla lebitso feela.
This is what he wanted.	Sena ke seo a neng a se batla.
I will not talk to you about it.	Ha ke na ho bua le uena ka eona.
It was at my school, too.	Ho ne ho le teng sekolong sa ka, hape.
My mind was already working hard.	Kelello ea ka e ne e se e ntse e sebetsa ka thata.
It should not be too difficult to get them to talk about it.	Ha ea lokela ho ba thata haholo ho etsa hore ba bue ka taba ena.
They were just talking about my hair.	Ba ne ba bua ka moriri oa ka feela.
It will not take long.	E ke ke ea nka nako e telele.
You certainly do.	Ka sebele u etsa joalo.
There was no way out.	Ho ne ho se na tsela ea ho tsoa.
You must be tired!	E tlameha ebe o khathetse!
He thought about all the things he had to say.	O ile a nahana ka lintho tsohle tseo a neng a lokela ho li bua.
It was not just my job.	E ne e se mosebetsi oa ka feela.
That's what he is.	Ke seo a leng sona.
The children love it.	Bana baa ba rata.
And no one talks about the past.	'Me ha ho motho ea buang ka nako e fetileng.
It never happened.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha etsahala.
Their very lives were at stake.	Bophelo bohle ba bona bo ne bo le kotsing.
They never did anything.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba etsa letho.
So he set out in search of real food.	Kahoo o ile a qala ho ea batla lijo tsa sebele.
However, I no longer know much.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke sa tseba hakaalo.
He has everything.	O na le tsohle.
I've seen it many times.	Ke o bone hangata.
I'm talking about children.	Ke bua ka bana.
I take care of my baby.	Ke hlokomela ngoana oa ka.
So, that's you.	Kahoo, ke uena eo.
Good stuff here.	Lintho tse ntle mona.
That's the way he is.	Ke kamoo a leng kateng.
My stomach hurts.	Mpa ea ka e bohloko.
But he wanted to say the same thing.	Empa o ne a batla ho bua ntho e le 'ngoe.
She is my favorite.	Ke eo ke e ratang haholo.
The young man asked again.	Mohlankana a botsa hape.
Or anyone.	Kapa mang kapa mang.
They found nothing, of course.	Ha ba ka ba fumana letho, ehlile.
Why a good question.	Hobaneng e le potso e ntle.
Writing, that is.	Ho ngola, ke hore.
But his.	Empa ea hae.
You know all the rest.	U tseba tse ling kaofela.
Everyone was happy.	E mong le e mong o ne a thabile.
We lived together for three years.	Re ile ra lula hammoho ka lilemo tse tharo.
I left the room.	Ke ile ka tsoa ka kamoreng.
Have you ever heard?	Na u kile ua utloa?
He took his time.	O nkile nako ea hae.
Which is that it has never happened before.	E leng hore ha ho mohla e kileng ea etsahala pele.
This picture is my favorite.	Setšoantšo sena ke seo ke se ratang haholo.
He would need a lot of money.	O ne a tla hloka chelete e ngata.
Moreover, it will be a wonderful time.	Ho feta moo, e tla ba nako e monate.
You can visit him a lot.	U ka mo etela haholo.
He doesn't care about other people.	Ha a tsotelle batho ba bang.
But everything was still there.	Empa tsohle li ne li ntse li le teng.
It's hard to say now.	Ho thata ho bolela jwale.
It's after you man.	Ke ka mora hao monna.
I did not understand that question.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise potso eo.
I did not know him at the time.	Ke ne ke sa mo tsebe ka nako eo.
You will have to catch it anyway.	U tla tlameha ho e tšoara leha ho le joalo.
I know you do.	Kea tseba hore u etsa joalo.
Maybe he'll be wearing his own.	Mohlomong o tla be a apere tsa hae.
I'm thinking of you.	Ke ntse ke nahana ka uena.
We are not eating dinner right now.	Ha re je lijo tsa mantsiboea hona joale.
He was waiting for her.	O ne a mo emetse.
Yes, his people.	E, batho ba hae.
That required planning.	Seo se ne se hloka ho rera.
I do not know how.	Ha ke tsebe hore na joang.
Not so bad.	Ha se ntho e mpe hakaalo.
I thought it was my turn.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke nako ea ka.
We will be there.	Re tla ba teng.
Even without a dog.	Le ntle le ntja.
he asked.	a botsa.
He learns to see it that way.	O ithuta ho e bona ka tsela eo.
They can say anything.	Ba ka bua eng kapa eng.
I'm sorry but it's true.	Ke masoabi empa ke 'nete.
Think once.	Nahana hang.
Sit down, son.	Lula fatše, mora.
It is not good news.	Ha se litaba tse monate.
Of course, there is a reason for that.	Ehlile, ho na le lebaka la seo.
I think we will see.	Ke nahana hore re tla bona.
I think that's a good thing.	Ke nahana hore ke ntho e ntle.
I see one reason here why it might be so.	Ke bona lebaka le le leng mona hore na ke hobane'ng ha ho ka ba joalo.
I have an important point to talk to you about.	Ke na le taba ea bohlokoa eo nka buang le uena ka eona.
There has to be.	Ho tlameha ho ba teng.
However, I like to say one thing.	Leha ho le joalo, ke rata ho bua ntho e le 'ngoe.
That's their style.	Ke mokhoa oa bona oo.
Maybe it was because she was the first one to see him cry.	Mohlomong e ne e le hobane a ne a qala ho mo bona a lla.
For me it really works.	Ho 'na e hlile ea sebetsa.
For some, the question was 'come in or be out'.	Ho ba bang, potso e ne e le 'ho kena kapa ho ba ka ntle'.
He is the father of my son.	Ke ntate oa mora oa ka.
There is no point in going there.	Ha ho na thuso ea ho ea moo.
My child started school.	Ngoana oa ka o ile a qala sekolo.
He loves children.	O rata bana.
We found nothing.	Ha rea ​​ka ra fumana letho.
This dog did very well.	Ntja ena e entse hantle haholo.
He will return.	O tla khutla.
Sounds like a good way to get started.	Ho bonahala e le mokhoa o motle oa ho qala.
I wanted to fix it.	Ke ne ke batla ho e lokisa.
People tell me that.	Batho ba mpolella seo.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Ho ne ho se letho le phoso.
I tried to do things.	Ke ile ka leka ho etsa lintho.
The best.	E ntle ka ho fetisisa.
No one wanted to see this.	Ha ho le ea mong ea neng a batla ho bona sena.
I wanted more than anything from here.	Ke ne ke batla ho feta ntho leha e le efe ho tloha mona.
We can find him.	Re ka mo fumana.
She wept bitterly.	A lla ka bohloko.
But we did not know it then.	Empa re ne re sa tsebe seo ka nako eo.
First, it was not true.	Ea pele, e ne e se ’nete.
But yesterday was the only thing that mattered.	Empa maobane ke sona feela se bohlokoa.
No need.	Ha ho hlokahale.
It certainly has money.	Ka sebele e na le chelete.
You may have seen some of these.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe u se u bone tse ling tsa tsena.
But that is only sometimes.	Empa ke ka linako tse ling feela.
I could not go home.	Ke ne nke ke ka ea hae.
I'm not saying it's bad.	Ha ke re e mpe.
What they need is a big old man.	Seo ba se hlokang ke monna e moholo oa khale.
Or second.	Kapa ea bobeli.
There are so many wonderful things out there.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tse ntle moo.
We see them every day.	Re ba bona letsatsi le letsatsi.
It takes almost your entire life to read one book.	Ho nka hoo e ka bang bophelo bohle ba hao ho bala buka e le 'ngoe.
Great for school and play.	E ntle bakeng sa sekolo le ho bapala.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
I, yes, it can take that long.	'Na, e, ho ka nka nako e telele hakaalo.
That’s why they have their job.	Ke ka lebaka leo ba nang le mosebetsi oa bona.
This was their second mistake.	Ena e ne e le phoso ea bona ea bobeli.
Someone did this.	Motho o entse sena.
I was just thinking.	Ke ne ke nahana feela.
But it gets nothing.	Empa ha e fumane letho.
I think I am.	Ke nahana hore ke .
It does not matter if anyone does it that way.	Hore na ho na le motho ea e etsang ka tsela eo ha se taba.
He is very good to me.	O molemo haholo ho nna.
These are good things.	Tsena ke lintho tse ntle.
Neither do I see the need.	Le 'na ha ke bone ho hlokahala.
That would be fun.	Hoo ho ka ba monate.
They won’t do that, will they?	Ba ke ke ba etsa joalo, na ha ho joalo?
Too much to read.	E ngata haholo ho e bala.
All of them are important.	Kaofela ha tsona li bohlokoa.
He is always there for me.	O teng kamehla bakeng sa ka.
Otherwise it is not.	Ho seng joalo ha ho joalo.
No one else can know.	Ha ho motho e mong ea ka tsebang.
You, you haven't done that and it's just not right.	Wena, ha o a etsa jwalo mme ha se hantle feela.
It was a wonderful time.	E ne e le nako e monate.
We go from one to the other and go back again.	Re tloha ho e 'ngoe ho ea ho e' ngoe ebe re khutlela morao hape.
And it probably was.	'Me mohlomong ho ne ho le joalo.
I love you more than you were my husband.	Ke u rata ho feta ha u ne u le monna oa ka.
Instead after work.	Ho e-na le ka mor'a mosebetsi.
I think about this very hard.	Ke nahana ka taba ena ka thata.
I called her and talked to her.	Ke ile ka mo letsetsa ’me ka bua le eena.
I even talked to him several times.	Ke ile ka ba ka bua le eena ka makhetlo a ’maloa.
I felt alone, alone, walking.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke le mong, ke le mong, ke ntse ke tsamaea.
I don’t think there is anything we can do more than that.	Ha ke nahane hore ho na le letho leo re ka le etsang ho feta moo.
I need money to buy food.	Ke hloka chelete ea ho reka lijo.
Stay in your room.	Lula ka kamoreng ea hau.
After dinner, you fell asleep.	Ka mor'a lijo tsa mantsiboea, u ile ua robala.
That was true, he seemed happy, happy.	Seo e ne e le ’nete, o ne a bonahala a thabile, a thabile.
Please do your homework now.	Ke kopa o etse mosebetsi oa hau oa sekolo hona joale.
What time will it be?	E tla ba nako mang?
I don’t see why you shouldn’t do something that way.	Ha ke bone lebaka leo ka lona o sa lokelang ho etsa ntho ka tsela eo.
I didn’t think it would work.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore e tla sebetsa.
Too bad.	E mpe haholo.
And because of that, you might say.	'Me ka lebaka, u ka re.
We must help them.	Re tlameha ho ba thusa.
I am sure it will work well.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore e tla sebetsa hantle.
Maybe there was something he could know about her.	Mohlomong ho ne ho e-na le lintho tseo a neng a ka li tseba ka eena.
We don't want to do anything with it.	Ha re batle ho etsa letho ka eona.
Yet that does not matter.	Leha ho le joalo seo ha se na taba.
One person ride.	Ho palama motho a le mong.
They don't see it.	Ha se bona.
Well, that's what they are.	Be, ke seo ba leng sona.
Thank you, though.	Kea leboha, leha ho le joalo.
We are human and we were together.	Re batho 'me re ne re le hammoho.
One day he left and did not return.	Ka letsatsi le leng o ile a tsamaea 'me ha aa ka a khutla.
Finally.	Qetellong.
Not very good, but it works.	Ha e ntle haholo, empa e sebetsa.
You could see that no one wanted to be there.	U ne u ka bona hore ha ho motho ea batlang ho ba moo.
I'm not sure what happened.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahetse'ng.
Whatever you like.	Eng kapa eng eo o e ratang.
I like watching the pain.	Ke rata ho shebella bohloko.
Getting what they used to have.	Ho fumana seo ba kileng ba ba le sona.
I wonder what will happen now.	Kea ipotsa hore na ho tla etsahalang jwale.
We can learn about it, yes.	Re ka ithuta ka eona, e.
They know him well.	Ba mo tseba hantle.
Until he does not.	Ho fihlela a se na.
I tell you this.	Ke le bolella sena.
The man worked.	Monna eo o ile a sebetsa.
To them, winning was everything.	Ho bona, ho hlola e ne e le ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
I will look at the book.	Ke tla sheba buka.
The truth is hard.	'Nete e thata.
I opened his door.	Ke ile ka bula lemati la hae.
Now they are people.	Joale ke batho.
I know you can't talk about it.	Kea tseba hore u ke ke ua bua ka eona.
He had taken everything he had to not let his feelings be seen.	Ho ne ho nkile sohle seo a neng a e-na le sona hore a se ke a lumella maikutlo a hae hore a bonahale.
I am writing.	Ke ntse ke ngola.
People will pay anything for it.	Batho ba tla lefa eng kapa eng bakeng sa eona.
If you do not find it there, call another school.	Haeba u sa e fumane moo, letsetsa sekolo se seng.
He lets her go.	O a mo tlohela.
This looks very nice.	Sena se shebahala hantle haholo.
It seems we know how to play.	Ho bonahala re tseba hore na re tla bapala joang.
And another one a week later.	'Me e mong ka mor'a beke.
He could not believe that this was happening again.	O ne a sa lumele hore sena se ne se etsahala hape.
That will take care of him.	Seo se tla mo hlokomela.
They belong to the Father.	Ke tsa Ntate.
I have to go.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
However, there are some problems here.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le mathata a mang mona.
It's taller than me.	E telele ho mpheta.
So it worked well.	Kahoo e ile ea sebetsa hantle.
Moreover, it would be untrue.	Ho feta moo, e ne e tla be e se 'nete.
We will live here.	Re tla phela mona.
She felt happy.	O ile a ikutloa a thabile.
He was the first person to arrive.	Ke eena motho oa pele oa ho fihla.
No, it must mean a lot of money.	Che, e tlameha ebe e bolela chelete e ngata.
And this was so much fun.	Mme ena e ne e le monate haholo.
So he died.	Kahoo o ile a hlokahala.
I did not like that question.	Ke ne ke sa rate potso eo.
We did our best.	Re entse sohle seo re neng re ka se khona.
But we will have time to drink.	Empa re tla ba le nako ea ho noa.
It was a thought now.	E ne e le mohopolo joale.
As you can see in the picture.	Joalo ka ha u bona setšoantšo.
They will not come.	Ba ke ke ba tla.
It just won't happen.	Feela e ke ke ea etsahala.
I like to write.	Ke rata ho ngola.
Nothing he did helped him move on.	Ha ho letho leo a le entseng le ileng la mo thusa ho tsoela pele.
I hope everyone will get what they want.	Ke tšepa hore bohle ba tla fumana seo ba se batlang.
We happen to be the same age.	Ho etsahala hore re lilemo tse tšoanang.
We did not want him.	Re ne re sa mo batle.
There was something wrong.	Ho ne ho ena le phoso.
Most of them are easy to reach.	Tse ngata tsa tsona li bonolo ho li fihlela.
Their eldest son died in an accident.	Mora oa bona e moholo o ile a hlokahala kotsing.
Then he did it again.	Eaba oa e etsa hape.
He was not sure what to expect.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na o lebeletse eng.
He always drives carefully.	O lula a khanna ka hloko.
Both have been arrested.	Ka bobeli ba tšoeroe.
She is with her husband.	O na le monna wa hae.
He does not look good.	Ha a bonahale hantle.
Something happened here recently.	Ho na le ntho e etsahetseng mona haufinyane.
I really like them.	Ke li rata haholo.
It's a really good idea.	Ke maikutlo a monate ruri.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
We think a little about it.	Re nahana hanyane ka eona.
Yes, it will work.	E, e tla sebetsa.
And what they are now.	Le seo ba leng ho sona jwale.
And you take that as a yes.	'Me u nka seo e le e.
From the past.	Ho tloha nakong e fetileng.
I don't know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke efe.
People do not want to know.	Batho ha ba batle ho tseba.
We do not think so.	Ha re nahane joalo.
He stops almost every day.	O ema hoo e ka bang letsatsi le leng le le leng.
We are doing.	Re ntse re etsa.
I look at him in a strange way.	Ke mo sheba ka mokhoa o makatsang.
I would love to meet him very much.	Nka thabela ho kopana le eena haholo.
These are the things we know we know.	Tsena ke lintho tseo re li tsebang tseo re li tsebang.
This was not an isolated incident.	Ena e ne e se maikutlo a le mong.
No day later.	Ha ho letsatsi ka morao.
We both saw what it was like.	Ka bobeli re ile ra bona hore na ho ne ho le joang.
Just to suggest that you may want to learn.	Feela ho fana ka maikutlo a hore u ka batla ho ithuta.
He was much older than I was.	O ne a mpheta haholo.
He could not do that.	O ne a ke ke a etsa hoo.
You only heard one.	U utloile e le 'ngoe feela.
If not, do not do so.	Haeba ho se joalo, u se ke ua etsa joalo.
Otherwise we have to go.	Ho seng joalo re lokela ho tsamaea.
I really enjoyed it.	Ke ile ka e thabela haholo.
It's not fun anymore.	Ha e sa le monate.
They all had their own.	Kaofela ba ne ba e-na le tsa bona.
Try not to eat them.	Leka hore u se ke ua li ja.
Stay close.	Dula haufi.
Not so today.	Ha ho joalo kajeno.
I think he did a good job.	Ke nahana hore o entse mosebetsi o motle.
Now we know we can.	Hona joale rea tseba hore re ka khona.
Since then, I have never needed anyone.	Ho tloha ka nako eo, ha ke e-s'o ka ke hloka motho.
This can be a good opportunity for us to make friends.	Ona e ka ba monyetla o motle oa hore re be metsoalle.
They are beautiful.	Li ntle.
He did this as quickly as he had before.	O ile a etsa sena kapele feela joaloka pele.
We became good friends at that time.	Re ile ra ba metsoalle e molemo ka nako eo.
I heard you come out this morning.	Ke u utloile u tsoa hoseng hona.
My opinion is fine.	Maikutlo a ka hantle.
It was not my business.	E ne e se taba ea ka.
He is sleeping.	O robala.
Then she cried a lot.	Eaba o lla haholo.
I don't know what time it is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke nako mang.
But that would not be good.	Empa hoo e ne e ka se be hantle.
That is where we are.	Ke hona moo re leng teng.
Because you are a man.	Hobane o monna.
It was a very difficult fact.	E ne e le 'nete e thata haholo.
Look what you made me do!	Sheba seo u entseng hore ke se etse!
He is real and he is human, too, like all of us.	Ke oa 'nete 'me ke motho, le eena, joalo ka rona bohle.
However, we.	Leha ho le joalo, rona.
Soon she was crying.	Kapele o ne a lla.
Finally, after a few hours of trying.	Qetellong, ka mor'a lihora tse 'maloa tsa ho leka.
For anything really.	Bakeng sa eng kapa eng ka 'nete.
Her mother, she cried.	Mme wa hae, a lla.
Children must attend school regularly.	Bana ba tlameha ho kena sekolo kamehla.
My husband is a high school teacher.	Monna oa ka ke tichere ea sekolo se phahameng.
He had never opened it.	O ne a eso ka a e bula.
But it is still there.	Empa e ntse e le teng.
You must definitely meet him.	Ka sebele u tlameha ho kopana le eena.
The police arrested him.	Mapolesa a ile a mo tšoara.
They continue to wear them today.	Ba tsoela pele ho li apara kajeno.
I said nothing.	Ha kea ka ka bua letho.
There was nobody there.	Ho ne ho se motho moo.
I would not do that now.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa joalo hona joale.
Of course not.	Ehlile ha ho joalo.
It was just something that happened.	E ne e le ntho feela e etsahetseng.
I couldn't do it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e etsa.
And my father thought he was probably getting dressed.	Mme ntate a nahana hore mohlomong o ntse a apara.
I tell them that this is the first thing you should do.	Ke ba bolella hore ke ntho ya pele eo o lokelang ho e etsa.
It was not the only method.	Ho ne ho se mokhoa feela.
It should be simple.	E lokela ho ba bonolo.
Much like each one.	Haholo joalo ka 'ngoe.
I mean, it can't be any worse.	Ke bolela, e ka se be mpe le ho feta.
The more you do it, the better it feels.	Ha u ntse u e etsa haholoanyane, e ikutloa e le betere.
It's just bad.	Ho mpe feela.
He had taken care of someone before.	O ne a kile a hlokomela motho pele.
No one will help you with this.	Ha ho motho ea tla u thusa ka sena.
There is no way to make money.	Ha ho mokhoa oa ho etsa chelete.
It's a sweet, sweet thing.	Ke ntho e monate, e monate.
That was his place.	Eo e ne e le sebaka sa hae.
Our place is news.	Sebaka sa rona ke litaba.
She is in her room.	O ka phaposing ya hae.
Would you like to go with me?	O ka rata ho tsamaea le 'na?
It works for me.	E ea sebetsa bakeng sa ka.
I know where they are.	Ke tseba moo ba leng teng.
You could not say what he came out with.	O ne o ke ke oa bolela hore na o tla tsoa le eng.
Who was injured.	Ea ileng a tsoa kotsi.
You can have it.	U ka ba le eona.
There is a name for it.	Ho na le lebitso la eona.
I still had a lot of money at the time.	Ke ne ke ntse ke e-na le chelete e ngata ka nako eo.
Instead, he returned home and fell asleep immediately.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a khutlela hae ’me a robala kapele.
Don't talk to me.	Se bue le nna.
You took him.	U mo nkile.
And I did a lot.	Mme ke entse tse ngata.
And I spend three years.	'Me ke qeta lilemo tse tharo.
I have to say that it often is.	Ke tlameha ho bolela hore hangata ho joalo.
He will have to help us.	O tla lokela ho re thusa.
So we can go back to it.	Kahoo re ka khutlela ho eona.
I had no idea how it works.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na e sebetsa joang.
Also, no problem.	Hape, ha ho bothata.
Everyone knows about them.	Bohle ba tseba ka tsona.
I'm just a human being.	Ke motho feela.
All of us.	Kaofela ha rona.
I know it can be hard to come here.	Kea tseba hore ho ka ba thata ho tla mona.
People are leaving, some are coming.	Batho ba tsamaea, ba bang ba fihla.
That they had to work the way they did.	Hore ba ne ba lokela ho sebetsa kamoo ba entseng kateng.
It was fun to meet everyone.	Ho ne ho le monate ho kopana le bohle.
I thought there was something wrong with me.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso ka ’na.
Provide food.	Fana ka lijo.
But you do not have to call him.	Empa ha o hloke ho mo letsetsa.
A child is an important factor.	Ngoana ke ntho ea bohlokoa.
They'll see that.	Ba tla bona seo.
Age of time.	Lilemo tsa nako.
This is not easy for me to do.	Sena ha se bonolo hore ke se etse.
They never asked questions.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba botsa lipotso.
That day was not too long ago, perhaps.	Letsatsi leo e ne e se khale haholo, mohlomong.
None of this was ours.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsena e neng e le ea rona.
The team has an idea of ​​where these can go.	Sehlopha se na le maikutlo a hore na tsena li ka ea kae.
He wants to retire.	O batla ho tlohela mosebetsi.
Nice to see you again.	Ho monate ho u bona hape.
I don't know what they did to him.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ba mo entseng.
As if he had never wanted anything.	Joalo ka ha ho mohla a kileng a batla letho.
I want to stay.	Ke batla ho dula.
He would have been very sad.	A ka be a ile a utloa bohloko haholo.
This seems to work.	Sena se bonahala se sebetsa.
That's right.	Ke 'nete eo.
It is new to me.	Ke e ncha ho 'na.
I would love to know that.	Nka thabela ho tseba seo.
Others expect you to do so.	Ba bang ba lebeletse hore u etse joalo.
I need your opinion.	Ke hloka maikutlo a hau.
But there was more.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata.
However, he is doing well.	Leha ho le joalo, o tsamaea hantle.
They can do whatever they want with you.	Ba ka etsa eng kapa eng eo ba e batlang ho uena.
He was a child.	E ne e le ngoana.
I have never seen this before.	Ha ke so bone sena pele.
It finally arrived.	Qetellong ea fihla.
That helped a little.	Seo se ile sa thusa hanyane.
It's not really weird.	Ha se ntho e makatsang ruri.
He didn't call.	O ne a sa letsa mohala.
Keep doing what you are doing.	Tsoela pele ho etsa seo u se etsang.
He had to keep the work he had done so far.	O ne a tlameha ho boloka mosebetsi oo a o entseng ho fihlela joale.
That had a strong truth in it.	Seo se ne se e-na le 'nete e matla ho sona.
I just want to talk.	Ke batla ho bua feela.
Now get out of here.	Jwale tloha mona.
His opinion is his.	Maikutlo a hae ke a hae.
You read this, don't you?	U bala sena, na ha ho joalo?
You have to pay.	O lokela ho lefa.
They knew they didn't have to.	Ba ne ba tseba hore ha ba a tlameha.
He loves her.	O a mo rata.
I can't say I understand him either.	Ke sitoa ho bolela hore kea mo utloisisa le 'na.
Her favorite activity was reading.	Ntho eo a neng a e rata haholo e ne e le ho bala.
So, you are my mother.	Ka hona, o mme wa ka.
Or, it seems.	Kapa, ​​​​ho bonahala eka.
But this is just a regular rule.	Empa ona ke molao feela oa kamehla.
The truth is, there is no one way.	'Nete ke hore, ha ho na tsela e le' ngoe.
Retirement is never a good idea.	Ho tlohela mosebetsi ha ho mohla e leng mohopolo o motle.
I'd like to speak with him today.	Ke kopa ho bua le eena kajeno.
Say you are going to have dinner.	E re u il'o ja lijo tsa mantsiboea.
People without food.	Batho ba se nang lijo.
So that was good for me.	Kahoo seo e ne e le molemo ho 'na.
I will give him this, and this,	Ke tla mo fa sena, le sena,
I know his children.	Ke tseba bana ba hae.
This he did.	Sena o ile a se etsa.
If so, we are done.	Haeba ho joalo, re qetile.
It's really good.	E hlile e molemo.
So we see a little bit of both.	Kahoo re bona hanyane ka bobeli.
I would love to hear from you.	Ke rata haholo ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
I loved it.	Ke ne ke e rata.
This happens almost daily.	Sena se batla se etsahala letsatsi le letsatsi.
I hope that will happen but you never know.	Ke tšepa hore seo se tla etsahala empa ha u tsebe.
We must keep going.	Re tlameha ho tsoela pele re tsamaea.
It looked good enough.	E ne e bonahala e le ntle ho lekana.
I do not want to be alone.	Ha ke batle ho ba mong.
Some children love others.	Bana ba bang ba rata ho ba bang.
You have to catch it.	U lokela ho e tšoara.
But it can be really good.	Empa e ka ba molemo ha e le hantle.
She was no longer just a pretty girl.	E ne e se e se ngoanana e motle feela.
Both were easy.	Ka bobeli li ne li le bonolo.
Decide whether to have dinner.	Etsa qeto ea hore na u je lijo tsa mantsiboea.
Just something.	Ntho feela.
He just thought he had it.	O ne a nahana feela hore o na le eona.
Yes, just fine.	E, hantle feela.
It’s not how long you do something, but how often.	Ha se hore na u etsa ntho e telele hakae, empa ke hangata hakae.
And to work some more.	Le ho sebetsa tse ling hape.
You will be able to help.	O tla khona ho thusa.
But in the end they passed us by.	Empa qetellong ba ile ba re feta.
But that is probably the case.	Empa mohlomong ho joalo feela.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
We just have to be tough with them.	Re tlameha feela ho ba thata le bona.
But even that is sometimes difficult.	Empa le hoo ka linako tse ling ho thata.
However, there is another reason.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le lebaka le leng.
And in that first year.	Mme selemong seo sa pele.
It will be there.	E tla ba teng.
Everyone knows him.	E mong le e mong oa mo tseba.
What ever.	Eng kapa eng.
That thing had a name.	Ntho eo e ne e na le lebitso.
He can't take nothing.	A ke ke a nka letho.
For a long time they remained like that.	Ka nako e telele ba ile ba lula joalo.
I'm not telling you what you are.	Ha ke o bolelle seo o leng sona.
He was someone I really liked.	E ne e le motho eo ke mo ratang haholo.
I hope you will understand things.	Ke tšepa hore u tla utloisisa lintho.
I'm sure they understand that.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ba utloisisa seo.
They don't talk much.	Ha ba bue haholo.
Please leave after dinner.	Ke kopa u tsamaee ka mor'a lijo.
And, frankly, it still wasn't.	'Me, ho bua 'nete, e ne e ntse e sa etsa joalo.
I am human.	Ke motho.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke na bonnete.
Too much.	E ngata haholo.
And we did not start.	Hape ha rea ​​ka ra qala.
However, they could not do anything.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba sa khone ho etsa letho.
Or whatever happened, for that matter.	Kapa ho ne ho etsahalang, bakeng sa taba eo.
Of course.	Leha e le hantle.
Go back now.	Khutlela morao joale.
Today everyone does the same.	Kajeno bohle ba etsa joalo.
It didn’t seem important at the time.	E ne e sa bonahale e le bohlokoa ka nako eo.
Things are not like that.	Lintho ha li joalo.
Either method works.	Mokhoa ofe kapa ofe oa sebetsa.
Lots of things like that.	Lintho tse ngata tse joalo.
He asked questions.	O ile a botsa lipotso.
Che, che, che.	Che, che, che.
In one case there was another one of his.	Taba e 'ngoe ho ne ho e-na le e mong oa hae.
This is not their style.	Sena ha se mokhoa oa bona.
I just do not know when that day will be.	Ke mpa ke sa tsebe hore na letsatsi leo le tla ba neng.
You should visit him.	U lokela ho mo etela.
You will have to talk to them.	O tla lokela ho bua le bona.
This did not matter.	Sena se ne se sa tsotelle.
They are doing bad things.	Ba etsa lintho tse mpe.
I will continue with it again.	Ke tla tsoela pele ka eona hape.
Of course you can.	Ka sebele u ka khona.
It seemed more powerful.	E ne e bonahala e le matla haholoanyane.
No one is behind.	Ha ho motho ka morao.
We have nothing more to say.	Ha re na letho le leng leo re ka buang ka lona.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
For some reason it does not.	Ka lebaka le itseng ha e etse joalo.
He had an easy place for him.	O ne a e-na le sebaka se bonolo ho eena.
We wanted to.	Re ne re batla re .
No one needs such power.	Ha ho motho ea hlokang matla a joalo.
I could not sit here alone.	Ke ne nke ke ka lula mona ke le mong.
I had been in danger.	Ke ne ke kile ka ba kotsing.
We spent the night at his house talking.	Re ile ra qeta bosiu bohle re le ha hae re ntse re bua.
Their work is very hard.	Mosebetsi oa bona o boima haholo.
It's not very good.	Ha e ntle haholo.
Both of them could.	Bobeli ba bona ba ne ba ka khona.
Pay it first.	Ho e lefa pele.
Now, that still applies today.	Jwale, seo se ntse se sebetsa le kajeno.
I am new to this idea.	Ke ncha ka mohopolo ona.
It's my Life.	Ke bophelo ba ka.
I have been doing that for years.	Esale ke etsa joalo ka lilemo.
You can pass.	O ka feta.
It is important that you understand this situation.	Ho bohlokoa hore u utloisise boemo bona.
Perhaps even this time he will not stay long.	Mohlomong le nako ena a ke ke a lula nako e telele.
This can work for any job.	Sena se ka sebetsa bakeng sa mosebetsi ofe kapa ofe.
Your parents do not know about me.	Batsoali ba hao ha ba tsebe ka 'na.
They played very well.	Ba ile ba bapala hantle haholo.
As you know.	Joalo ka ha u tseba.
They had met others.	Ba ne ba kopane le ba bang.
I don't know who it might be.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e ka ba mang hape.
Then it was morning.	Joale e ne e le hoseng.
And they can be better.	'Me ba ka ba betere.
We needed it.	Re ne re e hloka.
But he was actually there.	Empa ha e le hantle o ne a le teng.
He wants everyone to love him.	O rata hore bohle ba mo rate.
Lots of stuff here.	Lintho tse ngata mona.
It could be days, or it could be very long.	E ka ba matsatsi, kapa e ka ba nako e telele haholo.
We do not know if he will continue to do so.	Ha re tsebe hore na a ka tsoela pele ka taba ena.
I feel like there is no big deal.	Ke utloa eka ha ho mosebetsi o moholo haholo.
Parents are very difficult.	Batsoali ba thata haholo.
Eventually the truth prevailed.	Qetellong 'nete e ile ea hlola.
But it could be all.	Empa e ka ba tsohle.
Of course, nothing happened.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala.
Or the way others have done it.	Kapa tsela eo ba bang ba entseng ka eona.
He could not get enough of it.	O ne a sa khone ho fumana ho lekaneng ho eona.
There was only one bedroom, but he didn’t care.	Ho ne ho e-na le kamore e le ’ngoe feela ea ho robala, empa o ne a sa tsotelle.
But it was no other.	Empa e ne e se e mong.
Then he knew.	Joale o ne a tseba.
It was clear he knew her.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore o ne a mo tseba.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang ka hona.
He looked at us expectantly.	O ile a re sheba a lebeletse.
I'm so glad you're here.	Ke thabile haholo ha o le mona.
But it is too late.	Empa e se e le morao haholo.
But life is not like that.	Empa bophelo ha bo joalo.
Just know this.	Tseba sena feela.
Watch the time.	Hlokomela nako.
However, this is not true.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se 'nete.
We decided that we should try to do them.	Re ile ra etsa qeto ea hore re lokela ho leka ho li etsa.
And we don't have much time.	Hape ha re na nako e telele.
I knew it would not be easy.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ho ka be ho se bonolo.
I hope you feel the things you first heard.	Ke tšepa hore u ikutloa lintho tseo u neng u qala ho li utloa.
What happened was invisible.	Se etsahetseng se ne se sa bonahale.
To fix this.	Ho lokisa sena.
He was not sure of the time.	O ne a se na bonnete ka nako.
I still felt dangerous.	Ke ne ke ntse ke ikutloa ke le kotsi.
He looked at her several times.	O ile a sheba ho eena ka makhetlo a 'maloa.
She looks at him.	Oa mo sheba.
Their children do the same.	Bana ba bona ba etsa joalo.
Then there is the good idea.	Joale ho na le mohopolo o monate.
They might go for that.	Ba ka nna ba ya bakeng sa seo.
It is too late for that now.	E se e le morao haholo bakeng sa seo hona joale.
I know you are happy with it.	Kea tseba hore u thabile ka eona.
The woman came home and found him.	Mosali a fihla hae a mo fumana.
He had a good feeling today.	O ne a e-na le maikutlo a monate ka kajeno.
You could trust him.	U ne u ka mo tšepa.
We never talked about it at all.	Ho hang ha rea ​​ka ra bua ka eona.
You can sleep at night.	U ka robala bosiu.
Plus, it's not very fun.	Ho feta moo, ha ho monate haholo.
They look great.	Li shebahala li le ntle.
I needed a car.	Ke ne ke hloka koloi.
Please correct this.	Ka kopo, lokisa sena.
I told you it didn't work the first time.	Ke u boleletse hore ha ea sebetsa lekhetlo la pele.
Think about the person you are.	Nahana ka motho eo u leng eena.
It is very important.	Ho bohlokoa haholo.
Lots of money.	Chelete e ngata.
I'll be back tomorrow.	Ke tla khutla hosane.
However, this is not always the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo kamehla.
Be aware of my feelings.	Hlokomela maikutlo a ka.
That's the only thing we know about this group.	Ke eona feela ntho eo re e tsebang hantle ka sehlopha sena.
You need to know this.	O lokela ho tseba sena.
I found my problem.	Ke ile ka fumana bothata ba ka.
It means he is passing.	Ho bolela hore oa feta.
It was a time when we felt we could do anything.	E ne e le nako eo re neng re ikutloa hore re ka etsa eng kapa eng.
We know what you did.	Re tseba seo o se entseng.
It’s something about my hair.	Ke ntho e 'ngoe ka moriri oa ka.
They decided.	Ba ile ba etsa qeto.
But it doesn't have to be that way.	Empa ha ho a tlameha ho ba ka tsela eo.
I'm glad of that.	Ke thabetse seo.
I can try.	Nka leka.
You heard it from him.	Le utloile ho eena.
The point is, everyone is looking at that.	Taba ke hore, motho e mong le e mong o sheba taba eo.
However, the first question for me.	Leha ho le joalo, potso ea pele ho 'na.
But time helps.	Empa nako ea thusa.
Or maybe not.	Kapa mohlomong ha se eona.
I pretended not to notice.	Ke ile ka etsa eka ha kea hlokomela.
But he would probably do so.	Empa mohlomong o ne a tla etsa joalo.
Which is the best.	E leng ho fetisisa.
I find it difficult.	Ke fumana ho le thata.
It all took a very long time.	Tsohle li ne li nka nako e telele haholo.
It was too late for that.	E ne e se e le morao haholo bakeng sa seo.
I was a problem.	Ke ne ke le bothata.
You will provide many things.	U tla fana ka lintho tse ngata.
She is doing well.	O ntse o sebetsa hantle.
They can do whatever they want.	Ba ka etsa eng kapa eng eo ba e ratang.
I know my father.	Ke tseba ntate.
The family thanked him for a wonderful evening.	Lelapa le ile la mo leboha ka mantsiboea a monate.
It was a good thing he was not there.	E ne e le ntho e ntle hore ebe ha a eo.
It almost gets it.	E batla e e fumana.
That is a decision.	Ke qeto.
People always say that life is important.	Kamehla batho ba re bophelo ke ba bohlokoa.
For the first time here.	Lekhetlo la pele mona.
We don't have much time.	Ha re na nako e ngata.
They had no idea.	Ba ne ba se na maikutlo.
They feel helpless.	Ba ikutloa ba se na thuso.
I love it more than my way, doesn’t it?	Ke e rata ho feta tsela ea ka, na ha ho joalo?
It was a family.	Le ne le le lelapa.
They had not seen each other for several years.	E ne e se e le lilemo tse 'maloa ba sa kopane.
It would not be an easy task.	E ne e ke ke ea e-ba mosebetsi o bonolo.
Or maybe they just want to feel strong.	Kapa mohlomong ba mpa ba batla ho ikutloa ba le matla.
I was up for breakfast.	Ke ne ke le hoseng ho ja lijo tsa hoseng.
He is a big, strong, strong man.	Ke monna e moholo, o matla, o thata.
Then people don't want to play anymore.	Ebe batho ha ba batle ho bapala hape.
Strange in a way.	E makatsang ka tsela e itseng.
And so far, my day.	'Me ho fihlela joale, letsatsi la ka.
So he did what they said.	Kahoo a etsa seo ba se buileng.
Apparently others have also found this.	Ho bonahala ba bang le bona ba fumane sena.
Whether I am a.	Hore na ke a.
Each is important.	E 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ea bohlokoa.
Anyway, I can call him.	Leha ho le joalo, nka mo letsetsa.
Now we know that they do.	Joale rea tseba hore ba etsa joalo.
There has never been a problem.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha e-ba le bothata.
Like my husband.	Joalo ka monna oa ka.
I'll go with you if you like.	Ke tla tsamaea le uena ha u rata.
He can't find them there.	Ha a li fumane moo.
My suggestion was not enough.	Tlhahiso ea ka e ne e sa lekana.
We are glad you got the job.	Re thabetse hore ebe u fumane mosebetsi.
Like high school kids.	Joalo ka bana ba sekolo se phahameng.
I have to say there are even more things.	Ke tlameha ho re ho na le lintho tse ngata le ho feta.
But he knew that this was not just his fault.	Empa o ne a tseba hore leo e ne e se lebaka la hae feela.
I still do not.	Ke ntse ke sa etse joalo.
He was not arrested.	Ha aa ka a tšoaroa.
Maybe it was shoes.	Mohlomong e ne e le lieta.
Do not try to say that you could not do that.	U se ke ua leka ho re le uena u ke ke ua etsa joalo.
But that was not what they wanted.	Empa e ne e se seo ba neng ba se batla.
That is the real life.	Ke bophelo ba sebele boo.
I don't care if you don't.	Ha ke tsotelle ha o sa etse joalo.
He didn't even want to think about it.	O ne a sa batle le ho e nahana.
We do not understand how anyone could do such a thing.	Ha re utloisise hore na motho a ka etsa ntho e kang ena joang.
You see.	Oa bona.
They just seem happy.	Ba bonahala ba thabile feela.
I have to ask a question.	Ke tlameha ho botsa potso.
So what is this.	Kahoo sena ke eng.
Well in advance.	Hantle ka pele.
Do it quickly.	E etse kapele.
They too are human.	Le bona ke batho.
One day.	Ka letsatsi le leng.
I would like to assume that this did not happen.	Ke kopa ho nahana hore seo ha sea etsahala.
You keep asking what they wanted as the night progressed.	U ntse u botsa hore na ba ne ba batla eng ha bosiu bo ntse bo tsoela pele.
It has always worked so well.	Ha esale e sebetsa hantle hakaalo.
He was trying to talk.	O ne a leka ho bua.
You have to wonder why.	U tlameha ho ipotsa hore na hobaneng.
At the time, he did not know what to expect.	Ka nako eo, o ne a sa tsebe hore na a ka lebella eng.
I think if you visit, you will love this place.	Ke nahana hore ha u ka etela, u tla rata sebaka sena.
Most people do not believe in it.	Batho ba bangata ha ba e lumele.
So there is no problem in using their content.	Kahoo ha ho na bothata ho sebelisa litaba tsa bona.
He was never in danger at all.	O ne a eso be kotsing ho hang.
He looked the same age as his father for years.	O ne a shebahala a lekana le ntate oa hae ka lilemo.
It is not just a matter of money.	Ha se taba ea chelete feela.
I understand that everyone was tired.	Kea utloisisa hore bohle ba ne ba khathetse.
I need it.	Kea e hloka.
I just worked on this.	Ke sa tsoa sebetsa sena.
It was nothing.	E ne e se letho.
That's the way it should be.	Ke kamoo ho lokelang ho ba kateng.
He would not know where he was.	O ne a sa tlo tseba moo a leng teng.
I hope people find this book useful.	Ke tšepa hore batho ba tla fumana buka ena e le molemo.
A strange and wonderful time.	Nako e makatsang le e makatsang.
He did not know who he was.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke mang.
No need.	Ha ho hlokahale.
He said he could live without them.	O ile a bolela hore a ka phela ntle le bona.
We live the old way.	Re phela ka tsela ea khale.
I'd like to see more here.	Ke kopa ho bona litaba tse ling mona.
Good thing, somehow.	Ntho e ntle, ka tsela e itseng.
She's a little soft.	O bonolo hanyane.
He thought about what his father would do.	O ile a nahana ka seo ntate oa hae a neng a tla se etsa.
I feel better too.	Le ’na ke ikutloa ke le betere.
You can do the same for tomorrow, too.	U ka etsa ntho e tšoanang bakeng sa hosane, hape.
Maybe it would be better if we did not tell anyone.	Mohlomong ho ka ba molemo ha re ka be re sa bolelle mang kapa mang.
This is not a crime.	Sena ha se molato.
Lots to like about it.	Tse ngata tseo u ka li ratang ka eona.
People have to go.	Batho ba tlameha ho tsamaea.
You can do it or not.	O ka e etsa kapa ha o e etse.
People lived here, and this was their life.	Batho ba ne ba lula mona, ’me bona e ne e le bophelo ba bona.
But the time has come for it to move.	Empa ho tla nako ea hore e tsamaee.
He spoke alone.	O ne a bua a le mong.
No one.	Ha ho na motho.
The car stopped.	Koloi ea ema.
However, I do not understand why.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke utloisise lebaka.
I hear but.	Ke utloa empa.
None of them made a mistake.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea entseng phoso.
They want to talk about being good.	Ba batla ho bua ka ho ba motle.
I went to talk to him.	Ke ile ka ea bua le eena.
Then people could buy them.	Joale batho ba ne ba ka li reka.
I had no time to wonder why.	Ke ne ke se na nako ea ho ipotsa hore na hobaneng.
Thank you as always.	Ke leboha joalo ka kamehla.
It was my job.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa ka.
It would be.	E ka ba.
So he gave some to them.	Ka hona, o ile a fana ka tse ling ho bona.
Well, he would never make that mistake again.	Be, o ne a ke ke a etsa phoso eo hape.
And it holds my weight.	'Me e tšoara boima ba ka.
That was just three of them.	E ne e le tse tharo feela tseo.
There is no more food.	Ha ho sa na lijo.
He was the only one there.	E ne e le mong moo.
Of course, it will not.	Ha e le hantle, e ke ke.
Do the books say this.	Na libuka li bolela sena.
He stared at her for a long time.	A mo sheba nako e telele.
But there are others, you know.	Empa ho na le ba bang hape, ua tseba.
Both of our parents drank coffee.	Batsoali ba rōna ka bobeli ba ne ba noa kofi.
I think this is a good thing.	Ke nahana hore sena ke ntho e ntle.
When he had finished eating, he fell asleep.	Ha a qeta ho ja, a robala.
We just wanted the good old things.	Re ne re batla feela lintho tse ntle tsa khale.
As you get better, you probably play even harder.	Ha u ntse u le betere, mohlomong u bapala ka thata le ho feta.
I can get a job, if necessary.	Nka fumana mosebetsi, ha ho hlokahala.
That doesn't make it easy.	Seo ha se etse hore ho be bonolo.
Ask for help if you need it.	Kopa thuso ha o e hloka.
He had a convenient location for the children.	O ne a e-na le sebaka se bonolo bakeng sa bana.
I can imagine you passing by.	Ke khona ho nahana hore na u ntse u feta.
He would have to do it.	O ne a tla tlameha ho e etsa.
The food was delicious.	Lijo li ne li le monate.
As he did.	Joalo ka ha a etsa.
To be with me.	Ho ba le nna.
We will take him.	Re tla mo nka.
‘Truth is not just one thing.	’Nete hase ntho e le ’ngoe feela.
Anything can happen.	Ntho efe kapa efe e ka etsahala.
In its own way.	Ka tsela ea eona.
He was happy to tell me.	O ile a thabela ho mpolella.
All night long it is a feast.	Bosiu bohle ke mokete.
However, I do not like it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke e rate.
And he probably needed help.	’Me mohlomong o ne a hloka thuso.
I can really talk to you.	Ruri nka bua le wena.
Thanks for coming here soon.	Ke leboha ho fihla mona kapele.
It is important to me.	E bohlokoa ho 'na.
I'm sorry but it's true.	Ke masoabi empa ke 'nete.
They could not see us but we could see them.	Ba ne ba sa re bone empa re ne re khona ho ba bona.
He is looking forward to the new time.	O lebeletse nako e ncha.
Offer to take.	Fana ka ho nka.
And then they see.	Mme ebe baa bona.
I'm just waiting for it.	Ke e emetse feela.
Nothing until they return.	Ha ho letho ho fihlela ba khutla.
It did something.	E entse ho hong.
That is, so far.	Ke hore, ho fihlela joale.
He drives carefully.	O khanna ka hloko.
I had to take a job.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho nka mosebetsi.
I would love to have them and hold them.	Nka thabela ho ba le tsona le ho li tšoara.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
I don't care about anyone.	Ha ke tsotelle motho.
The most important thing is that they are there.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa ke hore ba teng.
This is what the friends did, he thought.	Sena ke seo metsoalle e se entseng, o ne a nahana.
And you will never know.	'Me u ke ke ua tseba.
She's so cute, she thought.	O motle haholo, a nahana.
But there is more that we know than they do.	Empa ho na le lintho tseo re li tsebang ho feta kamoo ba tsebang ka tsona.
I think it is now.	Ke nahana hore ke hona jwale.
You need to make it easy to understand how to use it.	U hloka ho etsa hore ho be bonolo ho utloisisa mokhoa oa ho e sebelisa.
I can conclude that it is not very easy.	Nka etsa qeto ea hore ha bonolo haholo.
Her father was gone.	Ntate oa hae o ne a ile.
I have always been beautiful.	Haesale ke le motle.
Well, that's it, really.	Be, ke eona, ruri.
We had to fix it, yes.	Re ile ra tlameha ho e lokisa, e.
He knows more than that.	O tseba ho feta moo.
You can see the children at school.	U ka bona bana sekolong.
He has enough.	O na le ho lekaneng.
They all do the same.	Bohle ba etsa se tšoanang.
However, I really like them.	Leha ho le joalo, kea li rata haholo.
We will take care of everything else.	Re tla hlokomela tse ling tsohle.
No one asked why.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a botsa lebaka.
He knows it better than anyone else.	O e tseba ho feta tse ling kaofela.
It was very easy.	Ho ne ho le bonolo haholo.
But they were fun with it.	Empa ba ne ba le monate ka eona.
He would read them here.	O ne a tla li bala mona.
This is true, it is not true.	Sena ke 'nete, hase 'nete.
That is the way life is now.	Ke kamoo bophelo bo leng kateng hona joale.
In that room.	Ka phaposing eo.
No, he did not live anywhere.	Che, o ne a sa lule kae kapa kae.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
I'm glad we had the opportunity to be friends.	Ke thabela hore ebe re bile le monyetla oa ho ba metsoalle.
It did not have to be very long.	Ha ea ka ea tlameha ho nka nako e telele haholo.
And you may not be there after a few years.	'Me u ka' na ua se be teng ka mor'a lilemo tse 'maloa.
I thought we could help them.	Ke ile ka nahana hore re ka ba thusa.
I tried to be a better husband and father.	Ke ile ka leka ho ba monna le ntate ea molemo.
We all have to go further.	Kaofela re lokela ho tsamaea ho feta.
Because it will not be easy.	Hobane ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
Whatever you did, you were helping.	Eng kapa eng eo u neng u ka e etsa, u ne u thusa.
He was even going very well.	O ne a bile a tsamaea hantle haholo.
I went further than before.	Ke ile ka tsamaea ho feta pele.
There was one child, a boy.	Ho ne ho e-na le ngoana a le mong, moshanyana.
It was never mine.	E ne e se oa ka le ka mohla.
When it becomes difficult they do not know what to do.	Ha ho se ho le thata ha ba tsebe hore na ba etse eng.
But that seems to have happened.	Empa ho bonahala e le sona se etsahetseng.
Besides, it is very good.	Ntle le moo, e ntle haholo.
Look how beautiful they are!	Sheba kamoo ba leng batle kateng!
Often there was not enough energy for everyone.	Hangata ho ne ho se na matla a lekaneng bakeng sa bohle.
Like you were making trouble with it.	Joalo ka ha u ne u etsa bothata ka eona.
Hard to say, though.	Ho thata ho bolela, leha ho le joalo.
Three are the most important.	Tse tharo ke tsa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
I will give you everything you need to know soon the day.	Ke tla u fa tsohle tseo u hlokang ho li tseba haufinyane le letsatsi.
Of course, we do.	Ke 'nete, re etsa joalo.
The house was empty.	Ntlo e ne e se na motho.
Maybe it didn’t matter.	Mohlomong ho ne ho se taba.
That's the reason.	Ke lona lebaka leo.
I thought nothing of it and continued.	Ha kea ka ka nahana letho ka eona eaba ke tsoela pele.
Some days were longer than others.	Matsatsi a mang ho ne ho nka nako e telele ho feta a mang.
So we'll see how it goes.	Kahoo re tla bona hore na e tsamaea joang.
This is their financial situation.	Ena ke boemo ba bona ba chelete.
But no, he did not say anything before he left.	Empa che, ha a ka a bua letho pele a tsamaea.
Besides, they had to be family again.	Ntle ho moo, ba ne ba lokela ho ba lelapa hape.
He was tired.	O ne a khathetse.
Maybe we should talk about another time.	Mohlomong re lokela ho bua ka nako e ’ngoe.
He is sure of everything.	O na le bonnete ba ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
It should not have happened.	E ne e sa lokela ho etsahala.
He wants your family.	O batla lelapa la hao.
He had to make a decision.	O ne a lokela ho etsa qeto.
They can be something important, enough.	Li ka ba tsa bohlokoa ho hong, ho lekana.
They live by it.	Ba phela ka tsona.
It was a little fun.	E ne e le monate hanyane.
It seems to be a daily chore in my life.	Ho bonahala e le mosebetsi oa letsatsi le letsatsi oa bophelo ba ka.
No one could love that boy more than we do.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka rata moshanyana eo ho re feta.
It's a very good picture.	Ke setšoantšo se setle haholo.
Thanks for the suggestion.	Re leboha tlhahiso.
If you want to, of course.	Ha o batla, ehlile.
I will work tonight.	Ke tla sebetsa bosiung bona.
This is what we are.	Sena ke seo re leng sona.
Otherwise you will not be able to see it.	Ho seng joalo u ke ke ua khona ho e bona.
I think that's his name.	Ke nahana hore ke lebitso la hae.
I just think it will be fun to see it.	Ke mpa ke nahana hore ho tla ba monate ho o bona.
I even realized that at that moment.	Ke ile ka ba ka hlokomela hore ka nako eo.
I’m not a morning person, but it’s my favorite time of the day.	Ha ke motho oa hoseng, empa ke nako eo ke e ratang haholo ea letsatsi.
It's just bad.	E mpe feela.
Too bad.	E mpe haholo.
I can't wear it.	Ha ke khone ho e apara.
Up to it.	Ho fihlela ho eona.
My wife said it was probably time to go home.	Mosali oa ka o ile a re mohlomong ke nako ea ho khutlela hae.
We knew where we were every day at any given time.	Re ne re tseba moo letsatsi le leng le le leng ka nako efe kapa efe.
I can live with that for a long, long time.	Nka phela ka seo nako e telele, e telele.
He had not done so for years.	E ne e se e le lilemo a sa etse joalo.
He says he does.	O re oa etsa joalo.
I can have.	nka ba le .
I don't do it.	Ha ke e etse.
And the way they talk.	Le tsela eo ba buang ka eona.
He should not have done this.	O ne a sa lokela ho etsa sena.
They found nothing.	Ha ba ka ba fumana letho.
It was still there.	Ho ne ho ntse ho le teng.
I did not stop.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke ema.
It is better to get to know him.	Ho molemo ho mo tseba.
The doctor felt guilty.	Ngaka e ile ea ikutloa e le molato.
He often spoke without thinking.	Hangata o ne a bua a sa nahane.
It's a group.	Ke sehlopha.
I get feedback often.	Ke fumana maikutlo hangata.
And the fact is that he may not exist.	'Me 'nete ke hore a ka 'na a se ke a ba teng.
I am learning.	Ke ntse ke ithuta.
I can't even stand to hear it.	Ha ke khone le ho ema ho e utloa.
Who will be the best?	Ke mang ea tla ba molemo ka ho fetisisa?
He had seen what he should not have seen.	O ne a bone seo a neng a sa lokela ho se bona.
It's really fun.	Ho monate ruri.
The party was very fun.	Mokete ona o ne o le monate haholo.
Everyone knows the danger.	E mong le e mong o tseba kotsi.
He said he was tired.	O ile a re o khathetse.
Of course.	Ka 'nete.
Think about doing it.	Nahana ka ho e etsa.
It wasn’t a bad thing or anything.	E ne e se ntho e mpe kapa eng kapa eng.
In fact, he did not even know why he was there.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a sa tsebe le hore na ke hobane’ng ha a le moo.
I'm so tired!	Ke khathetse haholo!
And it's beautiful.	Mme e ntle.
This could not go anywhere.	Sena se ne se sa khone ho ea kae kapa kae.
If you do not know.	Haeba ha u tsebe.
Maybe more.	Mohlomong ho feta.
I'm just talking.	Ke bua feela.
Anything we wanted.	Eng kapa eng eo re neng re e batla.
I really want to hear your thoughts.	Ke hlile ke batla ho utloa maikutlo a hau.
I would have tried harder to make him stay.	Nka be ke ile ka leka ka matla ho etsa hore a lule.
I would not be able to do that.	Ke ne nke ke ka khona ho etsa joalo.
They wanted to get started quickly.	Ba ne ba batla ho qala kapele.
We are all in the same group.	Kaofela re sehlopheng se le seng.
If you don't want to do it, just say it.	Ha o sa batle ho e etsa, e bue feela.
It can be very fun.	E ka ba monate haholo.
The car starts.	Koloi ea qala.
He said it again.	A e bua hape.
Anyway, good, don't you think?	Leha ho le joalo, e ntle, ha u nahane?
I was not sure, but I could not find anything better.	Ke ne ke se na bonnete, empa ke ne ke sa khone ho fumana letho le betere.
They had one son.	Ba ne ba e-na le mora a le mong.
She has always wanted her children.	Haesale a batla bana ba hae.
It's that simple.	Ho bonolo joalo.
You would have seen my house.	U ka be u bone ntlo ea ka.
Do not say anything.	O seke wa bua letho.
The problem is money.	Bothata ke chelete.
This will not always be the case.	Sena se ke ke sa ba joalo ka nako e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
I wanted to fix my head.	Ke ne ke batla ho lokisa hlooho ea ka.
I should thank him for that.	Ke lokela ho mo leboha ka seo.
He thought he didn't care.	O ne a nahana hore ha a tsotelle.
Give this to a high school teacher.	Fana ka sena ho tichere ea sekolo se phahameng.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
He has no phone.	Ha a na mohala.
But that would not happen often.	Empa seo se ka be se sa etsahala hangata.
I tell you how it is here.	Kea le bolella hore na ho joang mona.
You can get it, or you can't get it.	U ka e fumana, kapa u se ke ua e fumana.
That's what he had to do.	Ke seo a neng a lokela ho se etsa.
They felt important.	Ba ne ba ikutloa ba le bohlokoa.
Like, real, real.	Joalo ka, ea 'nete, ea sebele.
They can write, and read, but they can't think.	Ba khona ho ngola, le ho bala, empa ha ba khone ho nahana.
Because he is strong.	Hobane o matla.
This can be very good.	Sena se ka ba hantle haholo.
We will be arriving soon.	Re tla fihla haufinyane.
I know it's too late.	Kea tseba hore e se e le morao.
He would not have heard of this.	O ne a ke ke a utloa ka sena.
She is very shy.	O lihlong haholo.
And this book is about getting what you want.	Mme buka ena e bua ka ho fumana seo o se batlang.
I call.	Ke letsa.
First impressions are important.	Maikutlo a pele a bohlokoa.
Of course you do.	Ehlile u etsa joalo.
Too much to think about.	Tse ngata haholo ho nahana ka tsona.
We will do our best to help you.	Re tla etsa seo re ka se khonang ho u thusa.
We have to make this decision.	Re tlameha ho nka qeto ena.
There are other problems with it.	Ho na le mathata a mang hape ka eona.
But it would not be easy.	Empa ho ne ho ka se be bonolo.
I will take care of you.	Ke tla o hlokomela.
They did not retreat.	Ha baa ka ba khutlela morao.
There was no sun.	Ho ne ho se letsatsi.
But one important issue of driving remains.	Empa taba e le 'ngoe ea bohlokoa ba ho khanna e ntse e le teng.
I just worked.	Ke sa tsoa sebetsa.
I love what they did with that place.	Ke rata seo ba se entseng ka sebaka seo.
The problem is that.	Bothata ke hore.
She was beautiful, very beautiful.	O ne a le motle, a le motle haholo.
This amount is not enough.	Chelete ena ha ea lekana.
But the opportunity was there.	Empa monyetla o ne o le teng.
Many people visited him.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba mo etela.
But there is more to that group.	Empa ho na le tse ling tsa sehlopha seo.
I saw them play.	Ke ba bone ha ba bapala.
I can go on my own.	Nka ea ka.
He is coming right.	O tla hantle.
We did not do that.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
But it belongs to him.	Empa ke oa hae.
Thank you so much for your help.	Ke leboha thuso ea hau haholo.
This house has been empty for years.	Ntlo ena esale e se na batho ka lilemo tse ngata.
Anyone can learn to read quickly.	E mong le e mong a ka ithuta ho bala kapele.
Your parents will never know.	Batsoali ba hao ba ke ke ba tseba.
The stronger it is, the better.	E matla le ho feta, e betere.
They knew him.	Ba ne ba mo tseba.
But he was probably too tired to play.	Empa mohlomong o ne a khathetse hoo a neng a sitoa ho bapala.
This thing is hard.	Ntho ena e thata.
The reason it has to be true is another matter.	Lebaka leo ka lona e lokelang ho ba ’nete ke taba e ’ngoe.
He asked me to go with you.	O ile a re ke tsamaee le uena.
These can often have some of the best features.	Hangata tsena li ka ba le tse ling tsa lintho tse ntle ka ho fetisisa.
We could not move quickly.	Ha rea ​​ka ra khona ho tsamaea kapele.
Come and stay with me.	Tlo ho lula le nna.
Find what you want to do.	Fumana ntho eo u batlang ho e etsa.
You are useless.	Ha u na thuso.
You now understand how he is.	Ua utloisisa joale hore na o joang.
It will make a good picture like that.	E tla etsa setšoantšo se setle joalo.
We do not need this.	Ha re hloke sena.
It can really be fun to play.	Ka sebele ho ka ba monate ho bapala.
Find us after a week.	U re batle ka mor'a beke.
That was my life.	E ne e le bophelo ba ka boo.
He needed help immediately.	O ne a hloka thuso le kapele.
Very simply.	Ka mokhoa o bonolo haholo.
I know who he is.	Kea tseba hore na ke mang.
We used to play in it when we were kids.	Re ne re tloaetse ho bapala ho eona ha re sa le bana.
She knew him better now.	O ne a mo tseba ho feta jwale.
But he is getting in.	Empa a ntse a kena.
This is not a place.	Sena ha se sebaka.
No one should find him here.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho mo fumana mona.
I did nothing.	Ha kea etsa letho.
They only learn as they go.	Ba ithuta feela ha ba ntse ba tsamaea.
That's just what happens.	Ke sona feela se etsahalang.
Such a good book.	Buka e ntle joalo.
She was incredibly beautiful.	O ne a le motle ka tsela e makatsang.
You and your mother.	Wena le mme wa hao.
I look every morning.	Ke sheba hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
How it should work.	Kamoo e lokelang ho sebetsa kateng.
Or weird, or simple, or simple.	Kapa e makatsang, kapa e bonolo, kapa e bonolo.
They were very close.	Ba ne ba le haufi haholo.
I wondered what was going on.	Ke ne ke ipotsa hore na ho etsahalang.
They said we could find them tomorrow.	Ba itse re ka li fumana hosane.
This is.	Sena ke.
You have your money.	U na le chelete ea hau.
It's a tough situation but we have to keep playing.	Ke boemo bo boima empa re tlameha ho lula re bapala.
It was not necessarily that my work was hard.	E ne e se hakaalo hore mosebetsi oa ka o ne o le boima.
I don't know where to start.	Ha ke tsebe hore na nka qala kae.
But he did not know what to do next.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng hape.
Water, as we all know, is vital.	Metsi, joalo ka ha bohle re tseba, a bohlokoa.
I come and go and I have my life.	Ke tla le ho tsamaea 'me ke na le bophelo ba ka.
It happens to me a lot.	Ho etsahala le nna haholo.
What is that? 	Ke eng hoo?
he asked.	a botsa.
Sometimes they tell me what they want.	Ka linako tse ling ba mpolella seo ba se batlang.
Only three from it.	Tse tharo feela ho tloha ho eona.
I've never seen it.	Ha ke eso e bone.
I have not yet decided.	Ha ke so etse qeto.
I haven't done that for years.	Ha ke so etse joalo ka lilemo.
He was tired and fell asleep quickly.	O ne a khathetse ’me a robala kapele.
I'm begging for more.	Ke ntse ke kopa ho feta.
Good news for the day.	Litaba tse monate tsa letsatsi.
We don't want to see that happen.	Ha re batle ho bona seo se etsahala.
That would do well.	Seo se ne se tla etsa hantle.
He said he did not care what people thought.	O ile a re ha a tsotelle hore na batho ba nahana eng.
You come to my place for dinner.	U tla sebakeng sa ka bakeng sa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
Moreover, she realized that she wanted to tell someone about what had happened.	Ho feta moo, o ile a hlokomela hore o batla ho bolella motho e mong se etsahetseng.
Why do so many people come there?	Ke hobane'ng ha batho ba bangata ba tla moo?
He did not know the place.	O ne a sa tsebe sebaka seo.
I think of a lot of things.	Ke nahana ka lintho tse ngata.
He didn't look at it.	Ha a ka a e sheba.
Don't try to make me see anything again.	O seke wa leka ho etsa hore ke bone letho hape.
It is not a strong type.	Ha se mofuta o matla.
It’s good to play a little, but it’s good.	Ho molemo ho bapala hanyane, empa ho molemo.
It had to happen that way.	E ne e lokela ho etsahala ka tsela eo.
It is worse than the real thing.	E mpe ho feta ntho ya sebele.
A lot of things can happen during this time.	Ho ka etsahala lintho tse ngata nakong ena.
I think that is important.	Ke nahana hore seo ke sa bohlokoa.
The decision was that it would not be possible.	Qeto e bile hore e ke ke ea khona.
He seemed a.	O ne a bonahala a.
Do you.	Na u.
To one of them.	Ho e mong oa bona.
Nor do we need to do so.	Hape ha ho hlokahale hore re etse joalo.
If you look closely, you can know.	Haeba u sheba haufi, u ka tseba.
This, however, by the way.	Sena, leha ho le joalo, ka tsela.
And the baby in the back.	Le ngoana ka morao.
He was very nice.	O ne a le monate haholo.
And the condition of the car.	Le boemo ba koloi.
Now, don't say anything to anybody.	Jwale, o seke wa bua letho ho mang kapa mang.
Of course, priorities first.	Ehlile, lintho tsa bohlokoa pele.
You have to look at it that way.	U tlameha ho e sheba joalo.
We read both, many people read it.	Re e bala ka bobeli, batho ba bangata ba e bala.
Her reading begins.	Ho bala ha hae ho qala.
But please don't do it.	Empa ke kopa o seke oa e etsa.
However, I did not spend much time thinking about that.	Leha ho le joalo, ha kea ka ka qeta nako e ngata ke nahana ka seo.
I will not take a job.	Nke ke ka nka mosebetsi.
Without the help of the police it makes it even more difficult.	Ntle le thuso ea mapolesa e etsa hore ho be thata le ho feta.
They certainly look good.	Ka sebele ba shebahala hantle.
He works hard and does a good job.	O sebetsa ka thata mme o etsa mosebetsi o motle.
But the way we do it is important.	Empa tsela eo re e etsang ka eona ea bohlokoa.
I wanted to do another one, too.	Ke ne ke batla ho etsa e 'ngoe, le 'na.
That was not the case.	Eo e ne e se e.
It is difficult for some.	Ho thata ho ba bang.
He is near here.	O haufi le mona.
Then he was there.	Joale o ne a le teng.
We use it for everything.	Re e sebelisa bakeng sa ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
Talking about such things can be important.	Ho bua ka lintho tse joalo ho ka ba bohlokoa.
I live alone.	Ke phela hantle ke le mong.
It does something to me.	E etsa ho hong ho nna.
He had done that.	O ne a entse seo.
I'm sorry to leave so soon.	Ke masoabi ho tsamaea kapele.
He certainly did what he could.	Ka sebele o entse sohle seo a ka se khonang.
I am very happy for him because he is such a wonderful person.	Ke mo thabetse haholo hobane ke motho ea makatsang.
I move from place to place.	Ke tloha sebakeng ho ea ho se seng.
Maybe they made a mistake.	Mohlomong ba entse phoso.
The reason for this is also easy to understand.	Lebaka la sena le lona le bonolo ho le utloisisa.
He was sure he could not hear well.	O ne a na le bonnete ba hore ha a khone ho utloa hantle.
Not at all.	Leha e le hang.
I can go back to writing.	Nka khutlela ho ngola.
In fact, it is easier said than done.	Ha e le hantle, ho bonolo ho bua ho feta ho etsa.
For dog food.	Bakeng sa lijo tsa ntja.
He will be strong.	O tla ba matla.
Where did all the people go?	Batho bohle ba ile kae?
Maybe he was working.	Mohlomong o ne a sebetsa.
And that's exactly right.	'Me ho joalo hantle.
You will find a way out.	O tla fumana tsela ea ho tsoa.
However, it was difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le thata.
We have loved him ever since.	Haesale re mo rata ho tloha ka nako eo.
Strange thing, you know.	Ntho e makatsang, ua tseba.
You should not get to school too soon.	Ha ua lokela ho fihla sekolong kapele hakaalo.
Read a little.	Bala hanyane.
And we really made a good team.	Mme ruri re entse sehlopha se setle.
We haven't done anything yet.	Ha re e-so etse letho.
Great place to shop.	Sebaka se setle sa ho reka.
I just can't go.	Ha ke khone ho ea feela.
It was easy to find him.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho mo fumana.
He asked if he had made a mistake.	O ile a botsa hore na o entse phoso.
We do not know whether to believe him or not.	Ha re tsebe hore na re mo lumele kapa che.
Do you see this in yourself?	Na see u se bona ho uena?
Being alone with any man can be dangerous.	Ho ba mong le monna e mong le e mong ho ka ba kotsi.
None of that was needed.	Ho ne ho se letho la tseo le neng le hlokahala.
I said anyway.	Ke itse leha ho le joalo.
Nobody said anything.	Ha ho motho ya kileng a bua letho.
Easy is usually the best.	Hangata ho bonolo ho molemo ka ho fetisisa.
But the law continues.	Empa molao o tsoela pele.
He was almost alone now.	O ne a batla a bua a le mong jwale.
I like what he does.	Ke rata seo a se etsang.
However, you will have delicious food.	Leha ho le joalo, u tla ba le lijo tse monate.
He may not do that.	A ka 'na a se ke a etsa joalo.
I saw it open.	Ke bone ha ke bula.
This matter is very much to me.	Taba ena e teng haholo ho nna.
Get away from me.	Tloha ho nna.
It was very clear what he wanted to happen next.	Ho ne ho hlakile haholo hore na o batla ho etsahala’ng ka mor’a moo.
Some took matters into their own hands.	Ba bang ba ile ba nka litaba ka ho se lumele.
I need help.	Ke kopa thuso.
He and his wife have a son together.	Eena le mosali oa hae ba na le mora hammoho.
We knew there had to be a better way.	Re ne re tseba hore ho tlameha ho be le tsela e betere.
And it is the same today.	Mme ho ntse ho le jwalo le kajeno.
It was very difficult.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo.
Otherwise, it is legal.	Ntle ho moo, ke molao.
He just said how he felt about me at the time.	O ile a bolela feela kamoo a neng a ikutloa kateng ka ’na ka nako eo.
This can certainly be a problem.	Ka sebele ena e ka ba bothata.
I had to sit down and think about this.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho lula fatše ho nahana ka taba ena.
We do not need help.	Ha re hloke thuso.
I too went through it.	Le 'na ke ile ka feta ho eona.
It was so beautiful.	E ne e le ntle haholo.
All my own.	Tsohle tsa ka.
He certainly knows all of these things.	Ka sebele o tseba lintho tsena kaofela.
Our problem is to see what we have.	Bothata ba rona ke ho bona seo re nang le sona.
And a look.	Le ho sheba.
So, go ahead.	Kahoo, tsoela pele.
This is a good thing.	Ena ke ntho e ntle.
I continued.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele.
My father worked nights.	Ntate o ne a sebetsa bosiu.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
Very nice too.	E ntle haholo hape.
It could be my son or my wife.	E ka ba ka mora oa ka kapa mosali oa ka.
This was still a strange thing at the time.	Ena e ne e ntse e le ntho e makatsang ka nako eo.
She was crying a lot.	O ne a lla haholo.
It's just my imagination.	Ke mohopolo wa ka feela.
I just wanted to.	Ke ne ke batla feela.
You have time.	U na le nako.
They say you need it, you say they can keep it.	Ba re oa e hloka, u re ba ka e boloka.
That’s not hard, either.	Hoo ha ho thata, le hona.
He was a man.	E ne e le motho.
I want both.	Ke batla bobeli.
Someone to talk to.	Motho eo u ka buang le eena.
He lives alone.	O lula a le mong.
I'm working all the time.	Ke ntse ke sebetsa ka nako eohle.
They are real friends.	Ke metsoalle ea sebele.
Where we are.	Moo re leng teng.
Emotional questions.	Lipotso tsa maikutlo.
He will not be finished.	Ha a tla be a qetile.
They never did.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba etsa joalo.
This is the first one.	Ena ke ea pele.
Will we give it a go.	Na re tla fana ka eona.
One room was ideal if you did not need much.	Kamore e le 'ngoe e ne e le ntle haeba u sa hloke haholo.
You can use the space instead.	U ka sebelisa sebaka sebakeng sa .
Like, now.	Joalo ka, hona joale.
The friends you had are still your friends.	Metsoalle eo u neng u e-na le eona e ntse e le metsoalle ea hao.
That is why he is here.	Ke ka lebaka leo a leng teng.
They enjoy talking a lot.	Ba thabela ho bua haholo.
This was good.	Sena se ne se le molemo.
Thanks for finding me.	Ke leboha 'na u fumane.
Don't make us come looking for you.	U se ke ua etsa hore re tl'o u batla.
The book is really good.	Buka e ntle ruri.
No one wants the truth.	Ha ho motho ea batlang 'nete.
It's a powerful thing.	Ke ntho e matla.
And, yet.	Mme, leha ho le jwalo.
I can refuse.	Nka hana.
She was beautiful.	O ne a le ntle.
I want to keep my job.	Ke batla ho boloka mosebetsi oa ka.
His will take the longest, of course.	Ea hae e tla nka nako e telele ka ho fetisisa, ehlile.
But the room was empty.	Empa kamore eo e ne e se na letho.
Also, it is very simple.	Hape, ho bonolo haholo.
I have to do this.	Ke lokela ho etsa sena.
Don't work like that here.	O seke oa sebetsa joalo mona.
I really like to travel.	Ke hlile ke rata ho tsamaea.
That's the point, though.	Ke eona taba, leha ho le joalo.
It was not so.	E ne e se joalo.
I do not know who the first one is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ea pele ke mang.
Kind of real.	Mofuta oa sebele.
I had to think.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho nahana.
So you know how early we were leaving.	Kahoo ua tseba hore na re ne re tloha hoseng hakae.
You don't want to go either.	Le uena ha u batle ho ea.
But he comes out with these things.	Empa lintho tsena o tsoa le tsona.
He needed to see.	O ne a hloka hore a bone.
That went, too.	Seo se ile, le sona.
Look.	Sheba.
You will not make much money by doing this.	U ke ke ua etsa chelete e ngata ka ho etsa sena.
However, read the book.	Leha ho le joalo, bala buka eo.
I go in and out for days.	Ke kena ke tsoa ka matsatsi.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
Maybe she could understand what it was like when she loved him.	Mohlomong a ka ’na a utloisisa hore na ho ne ho le joang ha a mo rata.
None of them were present.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a le teng.
Do not do this again.	O seke wa etsa sena hape.
Not maybe with it.	Che mohlomong ka eona.
But they were his children.	Empa e ne e le bana ba hae.
Also, we wish we could fix this issue.	Hape, re lakatsa eka re ka be re lokisa taba ena.
Do not sit and work in the same place.	U se ke ua lula le ho sebetsa sebakeng se le seng.
Food is a fact of life.	Lijo ke 'nete ea bophelo.
So here's a first way of helping you out.	Kahoo mona ke mokhoa oa pele oa ho u thusa ho u thusa.
He did not have to.	O ne a sa tlameha ho etsa joalo.
This is your time.	Ena ke nako ea hau.
This is just fine.	Sena se setle feela.
And his son.	Le mora oa hae.
However, they refused to let him go.	Leha ho le jwalo ba hana ho mo tlohela.
I noticed for the first time that he looked a little tired.	Ke ile ka hlokomela ka lekhetlo la pele hore o ne a shebahala a khathetse hanyane.
Of course, you do not need them.	Ha e le hantle, u se ke ua ba hloka.
We are a family now.	Re lelapa hona joale.
The second good season is now.	Nako ea bobeli e ntle ke hona joale.
I lived here.	Ke ne ke lula mona.
There were so many things he wanted to think about first.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a neng a batla ho nahana ka tsona pele.
It's not right.	Ha se hantle.
I knew him well.	Ke ne ke mo tseba hantle.
Probably just for fun.	Mohlomong bakeng sa monate feela.
They left the party early.	Ba ile ba tlohela mokete pele ho nako.
It seemed to be going very well.	E ne e bonahala e tsamaea hantle haholo.
But he can say a few things about it.	Empa a ka bua lintho tse ’maloa ka eona.
He did not even know anyone.	O ne a bile a sa tsebe motho.
I gave him water.	Ke ile ka mo fa metsi.
Not a good thing or anything.	Ha se ntho e ntle kapa eng kapa eng.
It seems.	Ho bonahala eka.
The case was settled.	Molato o ile a tšoaroa.
Just like you now.	Joalo ka uena hona joale.
He knew about them.	O ne a tseba ka tsona.
I never did it myself.	Ha ke eso e etse nna.
That too is not news.	Le tsona ha se litaba.
Faster than you think.	Kapele ho feta kamoo o nahanang.
We get something or we don’t get it, but either way we learn.	Re fumana ho hong kapa ha re fumane, empa ka tsela efe kapa efe rea ithuta.
You know my thoughts.	O tseba mohopolo wa ka.
We should try to talk to them.	Re lokela ho leka ho bua le bona.
To him, this was not good news.	Ho eena, tsena e ne e se litaba tse monate.
Sometimes, it goes to work.	Ka linako tse ling, e ea sebetsa.
She does well when you love her.	O etsa hantle ha o mo rata.
Cycling to work was a great opportunity.	Ho palama baesekele ho ea mosebetsing e ne e le monyetla o moholo.
I heard you are a mental man.	Ke utloile hore u monna ea kelello.
I like that thing.	Ke rata ntho eo.
I can refuse.	Nka hana.
It was because of you.	E ne e le ka lebaka la hao.
And it can help.	Mme e ka thusa.
That is why you are my son.	Ke ka hona u leng mora oa ka.
He wanted to look at some of them.	O ne a batla ho sheba tse ling tsa tsona.
She did not believe that he would ever be with her.	O ne a sa lumele hore o tla ke a be le eena.
Then go beyond that.	Joale feta moo.
We may not do that.	Re ka 'na ra se ke ra etsa joalo.
And, yes, it worked.	Mme, e, e ile ya sebetsa.
You have a lot to learn.	U na le lintho tse ngata tseo u lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
She is as beautiful as she is.	O motle kamoo a leng kateng.
But this once he wanted to know the truth.	Empa sena hang o ne a batla ho tseba ka 'nete.
I found it easy to read.	Ke ile ka fumana ho le bonolo ho e bala.
I want to give that to other people.	Ke batla ho fa batho ba bang seo.
It is also not dangerous.	Hape ha se kotsi.
Also, we are all human.	Hape, bohle re batho.
He was in the back, where he loved it.	O ne a le ka morao, moo a neng a e rata.
So be it.	Ho be jwalo.
I can sleep anywhere.	Nka robala kae kapa kae.
And if he was not.	'Me haeba a ne a se .
If that was true, that's fine.	Haeba seo e ne e le 'nete, se setle.
But he is not guilty at all.	Empa ho hang ha a na molato.
I just hope he doesn't stay long.	Ke tšepa feela hore a ke ke a lula nako e telele.
He refused, saying that he was late.	O ile a hana, a re o se a le morao.
I wondered what they would be like.	Ke ne ke ipotsa hore na ba tla ba joang.
I have never seen anyone look so empty.	Ha ke eso bone motho a shebahala a se na letho hakana.
He will continue to do this until he is arrested.	O tla tsoela pele ho etsa sena ho fihlela a tšoaroa.
I found him.	Ke mo fumane.
We love him.	Rea mo rata.
Her whole family came to the party.	Lelapa la hae kaofela le ile la tla moketeng oo.
It was happening again.	E ne e etsahala hape.
I think you probably need some help.	Ke nahana hore mohlomong o hloka ho fumana thuso.
And their parents did.	’Me batsoali ba bona ba ile ba etsa joalo.
It obviously opens up space.	Ho hlakile hore e bula sebaka.
You will be able to get one, if needed.	U tla khona ho fumana e 'ngoe, ha ho hlokahala.
I'm there.	Ke teng moo.
I was happy my way.	Ke ne ke thabetse tsela ea ka.
That is a difficult question.	Ke potso e thata.
I met that year.	Ke kopane selemong seo.
It’s more about efficiency.	Ke ho feta ka ho sebetsa hantle.
Both children love this book.	Bana ka bobeli ba rata buka ena.
How he feels about his decision.	Hore na o ikutloa joang ka qeto ea hae.
I don’t see how bad it can be for you.	Ha ke bone hore na ho ka ba mpe hakae ho uena.
We did not do this.	Ha rea ​​etsa sena.
He made her do it.	O entse hore a e etse.
It seems so.	Ho bonahala ho le joalo.
He did not like it.	O ne a sa e rata.
And it should.	'Me e lokela.
I think about it a lot.	Ke nahana ka eona haholo.
Or he may not do that.	Kapa a ka 'na a se ke a etsa joalo.
All of this happened.	Sena sohle se ile sa etsahala.
But it can be a bad thing.	Empa e ka ba ntho e mpe.
Please try again later.	Ka kopo, leka ka mor'a nako e itseng.
That's because it is.	Ke hobane ho joalo.
Do it quickly.	E etse kapele.
Well, not anymore.	Be, ha ho sa le joalo.
He did them, so he could do them.	O ne a li etsa, kahoo a ka li etsa.
I don't believe you know him.	Ha ke lumele hore oa mo tseba.
I rode a very long bicycle.	Ke ile ka palama baesekele e telele haholo.
He took care of it.	O ile a e hlokomela.
He could do anything.	O ne a ka etsa eng kapa eng.
I am so happy with them !.	Ke thabile haholo le bona!.
We have no water.	Ha re na metsi.
And it was easy to do.	Mme ho ne ho le bonolo ho e etsa.
He would live on food from now on.	O ne a tla phela ka lijo ho tloha joale ho ea pele.
We are talking about it.	Re bua ka eona.
Before many people.	Pele ho batho ba bangata.
Maybe there is a reason.	Mohlomong ho na le lebaka.
It was also hard for her to hear.	Ho ne ho le thata le ho eena ho utloa.
What else do I have to do here.	Ke eng hape eo ke lokelang ho e etsa mona.
However, one thing is certain.	Leha ho le joalo, ntho e le 'ngoe ke ea sebele.
However, he did not stay that long.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a ka a lula joalo nako e telele.
Do not like it.	U se ke ua e rata.
It is better to plan ahead.	Ho molemo ho rera esale pele.
Everything goes well as long as it looks good.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e tsamaea hantle ha feela e shebahala e le ntle.
He knew exactly what to say.	O ne a tseba hantle seo a lokelang ho se bua.
Maybe they don’t think.	Mohlomong ha ba nahane.
It must be night.	E tlameha ebe ke bosiu.
There was no one, it was just a thing.	Ho ne ho se motho, ke ntho feela.
She was about to cry.	O ne a le haufi le ho lla.
To do so he went where he could find them.	Ho etsa joalo o ile a ea moo a neng a tla ba fumana teng.
But there is one more thing before you leave.	Empa ho na le ntho e 'ngoe hape pele u tsamaea.
Somehow, this is what this is all about.	Ka tsela e itseng, ke sona seo sena se leng sona.
But it does work.	Empa e etsa mosebetsi.
Then my wife started to cry.	Joale mosali oa ka o ile a qala ho lla.
They're working.	Ba ntse ba sebetsa.
This time will come soon.	Nako ena e tla fihla haufinyane.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
This is not the case now.	Hona joale ha ho joalo.
I'm looking forward to visiting the place.	Ke emetse ho etela sebaka seo.
Where was he going?	O ne a ea hokae?
Not enough.	Ha ea lekana ka ho fetisisa.
In fact, it was more than just making coffee.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le ho feta ho etsa kofi.
You are alive and well.	Ua phela 'me ua ithuta.
This happens often.	Sena se etsahala hangata.
But he thought it might be you.	Empa o ne a nahana hore mohlomong ke wena.
That was often the case.	Ho ne ho le joalo hangata.
He did not understand what made him do it.	O ne a sa utloisise hore na ke eng e entseng hore a e etse.
But that is not the case from now on.	Empa ha ho sa le joalo ho tloha joale ho ea pele.
It may be the first one.	E ka 'na ea e-ba eona ea pele.
It seems to work well.	E bonahala e sebetsa hantle.
We could know.	Re ne re ka tseba.
Not to mention that the police noticed.	Re sa bue haeba mapolesa a ile a hlokomela.
We have found the truth.	Re fumane ’nete.
I'm still not sure what to do with it.	Ke ntse ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ke etse eng ka eona.
I have used this method for many years.	Ke qetile lilemo tse ngata ke sebelisa mokhoa ona.
I try not to think of it that way.	Ke leka hore ke se ke ka nahana ka eona ka tsela eo.
Maybe he gets the impression that the child is not his.	Mohlomong o fumana setšoantšo sa hore ngoana hase oa hae.
Do you even have the money to give him we want to ask.	Na u bile u na le chelete ea ho mo fa re batla ho botsa.
We have other things to do.	Re na le lintho tse ling tseo re lokelang ho li etsa.
It has existed before.	E bile teng pele.
And you do, over and over again.	'Me u etsa joalo, hape le hape le hape.
It will take people.	E tla nka batho.
I like reading what you say.	Ke rata ho bala seo u se buang.
There must be something wrong.	E tlameha ebe ho na le phoso.
I would not try.	Ke ne nke ke ka leka.
This seems to me to be a mistake.	Sena se bonahala ho 'na e le phoso.
She did it to help her mother.	O ile a etsa joalo ho thusa ’mè oa hae.
They buy everything.	Ba reka tsohle.
I hope it works.	Ke tšepa hore e ea sebetsa.
We mean, man !.	Re bolela, monna!.
It has no sun.	Ha e na letsatsi.
I belong to everyone.	Ke ea bohle.
They have a very difficult decision to make.	Ba na le qeto e boima haholo eo ba lokelang ho e etsa.
I could see the reason.	Ke ne ke bona lebaka.
This is the last chance!	Ona ke monyetla oa ho qetela!
This allowed you to get what you needed.	Sena se ile sa u lumella ho fumana seo u se hlokang.
I love everything about her.	Ke rata tsohle ka eena.
That's the way he is.	Ke kamoo a leng kateng.
These seem old-fashioned.	Tsena li bonahala e le tsa khale.
Otherwise you will not see the opportunity.	Ho seng joalo u ke ke ua bona monyetla.
Now he wants to sleep.	Hona joale o batla ho robala.
Everything seemed simple.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e bonahala e le bonolo.
Find out how.	Fumana hore na joang.
I just refused.	Ke ile ka hana feela.
It looks good on you.	E shebahala hantle ho wena.
So it must be true.	Kahoo e tlameha ebe ke 'nete.
Maybe it's something you've never done before.	Mohlomong ke ntho eo u e-s'o ka u e etsa.
We were for those things.	Re ne re le bakeng sa lintho tseo.
He thought so too.	Le eena o ne a nahana joalo.
Everyone gets their money with us!	E mong le e mong o fumana chelete ea hae le rona!
Our teacher is very difficult.	Tichere ea rona e thata haholo.
Because they need it.	Hobane ba hloka.
But you did not come.	Empa ha ua ka ua tla.
Moreover, it was the last thing he wanted.	Ho feta moo, e ne e le ntho ea ho qetela eo a neng a e batla.
You could not go out like that!	U ne u ke ke ua tsoela ka ntle joalo!
It believes that space is empty.	E lumela hore sebaka ha se na lintho.
But they will not like the strange thing.	Empa ba ke ke ba rata ntho e makatsang.
I can't help them.	Ha ke khone ho ba thusa.
You have to get it, get it, get it!	U tlameha ho e fumana, ho e fumana, ho e fumana!
Thank you for coming with me today.	Kea leboha ha u tsamaea le 'na kajeno.
This comes from a good reading.	Sena se tsoa ho bala hantle.
I didn't want to talk to anyone at the time.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho bua le motho ka nako eo.
He was great.	O ne o le moholo.
You see, when you meet, you understand.	O bone, ha o kopane, oa utloisisa.
I don't care.	ha ke tsotelle.
Or maybe they are new.	Kapa mohlomong li ncha.
They had one man there, and only one man.	Ba ne ba ena le monna a le mong moo, le monna a le mong feela.
I continued.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele.
And the first one.	Le ea pele.
I thought.	Ke ne ke nahana.
I can't ask for more.	Ha ke khone ho kopa ho feta.
Obviously there was someone.	Ho hlakile hore ho ne ho e-na le motho.
You see.	Oa bona.
Yet he had it.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a e-na le eona.
Maybe it was an accident.	Mohlomong e bile kotsi.
I save and save and save to spend money.	Ke boloka le ho boloka le ho boloka ho sebelisa chelete.
Someone was trying to reach him.	Motho e mong o ne a leka ho mo fihlela.
Call, and others.	Letsa, le ba bang.
He was glad to see them coming.	O ne a thabetse ho ba bona ba tla.
Of course, that is not the case.	Ehlile, ha se seo.
You know your child well.	U tseba ngoana oa hao hantle.
He was the best man there.	E ne e le monna e motle ka ho fetisisa moo.
I know he exists.	Kea tseba hore o teng.
I started to cry again.	Ke ile ka qala ho lla hape.
One knows the other.	Motho o tseba e mong.
They are real people.	Ke batho ba sebele.
It's so nice to have you come with you.	Ho monate haholo ho uena ho tla le uena.
Just be right here, right now.	Eba hantle feela mona, hona jwale.
He opened his door.	A bula lemati la hae.
He asked her.	A mo kopa.
I can't get away from it yet.	Ha ke khone ho tloha ho eona leha ho le joalo.
It will be very difficult.	Ho tla ba thata haholo.
It certainly was.	Ka sebele ho ne ho le joalo.
He needed it, but he did not have time.	Ho ile ha mo hloka, empa o ne a se na nako.
I said nothing, but he did not notice.	Ha kea ka ka bua letho, empa ha aa ka a hlokomela.
I thought it was fun.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho monate.
Something so bad.	Ntho e mpe hakana.
I would need time to learn that.	Ke ne ke tla hloka nako ea ho ithuta seo.
She can no longer hear him.	Ha a sa khona ho mo utloa.
You just know what to do.	U tseba feela seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
Instead, nothing happens.	Ho e-na le hoo, ha ho letho le etsahalang.
There is only me and my wife, and our baby.	Ho na le 'na le mosali oa ka feela, le ngoana oa rona.
That can't be his mother.	Eo e ka se be 'mè oa hae.
Some seem to have this problem.	Ho bonahala eka ba bang ba na le bothata bona.
Or soon almost immediately.	Kapa kapele hoo e ka bang hang hang.
The boy and his father.	Moshanyana le ntate oa hae.
There are a lot of people.	Ho na le batho ba bangata.
He did not ask her to sit down.	Ha aa ka a mo kopa hore a lule fatše.
He tried to think of nothing.	O ile a leka ho nahana ka letho.
It was both.	E ne e le bobeli.
You did nothing wrong.	Ha o a etsa letho le phoso.
Some children were crying.	Bana ba bang ba ne ba lla.
You know, just do it.	O ya tseba, etsa feela.
It is precious water.	Ke metsi a bohlokoa.
The news was bad, very bad.	Litaba li ne li le mpe, li mpe haholo.
I see it as important.	Ke e bona e le ea bohlokoa.
I haven't seen him in a long time.	E se e le khale ke sa mo bone.
Then, too, some will agree.	Joale, ba bang le bona ba tla lumela.
No one knew anything.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba letho.
Power is good.	Matla a molemo.
I did not want to do this.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho etsa sena.
However, they are not the same people.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se batho ba tšoanang.
You need a car.	O hloka koloi.
They were arrested at that time.	Ba ile ba tšoaroa ka nako eo.
However, we did not think so.	Leha ho le joalo, re ne re sa nahane joalo.
Just stop and think.	Ema feela 'me u nahane.
I still had work to do.	Ke ne ke ntse ke e-na le mosebetsi oo ke lokelang ho o etsa.
So he did.	Kahoo o ile a etsa joalo.
He just looked at her.	A mo sheba feela.
He probably left that place to do what he wanted.	Mohlomong o ile a tloha sebakeng seo ho ea etsa seo a se batlang.
That makes him human.	Seo se mo etsa motho.
It was nothing to me.	E ne e se letho ho nna.
What is your favorite book?	Ke buka efe eo u e ratang haholo?
It was a good book for me.	E ne e le buka e ntle ho nna.
Then they can.	Joale ba ka khona.
Everyone knows it.	E mong le e mong oa e tseba.
Now it seemed that he would have to do just that.	Joale ho ne ho bonahala eka o tla tlameha ho etsa sona seo.
We know how to live with this.	Re tseba ho phela le sena.
I think he still knew.	Ke nahana hore leha ho le joalo o ne a tseba.
I just feel it strongly.	Ke e utloa ka matla feela.
Time and time again.	Nako le nako hape.
And his wife.	Le mosali oa hae.
If he had told her.	Hoja a mo boleletse.
Once you have seen them, you will want to see more, and more.	Ha u se u li bone, u tla batla ho bona tse ling, le tse ling.
Yes, this child.	E, ngoana ee.
Or you are in pain.	Kapa u utloa bohloko.
Maybe this will help.	Mohlomong sena se tla thusa.
I hope it helped you too.	Kea tšepa hore le lona le ile la u thusa.
Dinner was very late.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea li ne li le morao haholo.
He did as he pleased.	A etsa kamoo a ratang kateng.
He could be here.	A ka ba mona.
Someone who wanted us to meet.	Motho ya neng a batla hore re kopane.
I have had good times and bad times.	Ke bile le linako tse monate le tse mpe.
I say this is not your business.	Ke re sena ha se taba ea hau.
It is not enough.	Ha ea lekana.
However, this is not always the case.	Leha ho le joalo, hase hangata.
We can buy.	Re ka reka.
He was glad he did.	O ile a thabela hore ebe o entse joalo.
Please sit down.	Ke kopa o lule fatše.
Thank you for your work and energy.	Ke leboha mosebetsi oa hau le matla a hau.
No one ever told me to read.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a mpolella ho bala.
I'll take you with me.	Ke tla o nka le nna.
In fact, he did just that.	Ha e le hantle, o ile a etsa joalo.
He clapped his hands.	A mo kopa ka matsoho.
It was what he was that mattered most.	E ne e le seo a neng a le sona se neng se le bohlokoa haholo.
We ask about your health.	Re botsa ka bophelo ba hau.
For today only, think of a life without shame.	Bakeng sa kajeno feela, nahana ka bophelo bo se nang lihlong.
He would know that.	O ne a tla tseba seo.
I have a house now.	Ke na le ntlo hona joale.
I found a way.	Ke bone tsela.
He goes where he wants to go.	O ya moo e batlang ho ya teng.
That's what we all are.	Ke ntho eo rona batho bohle.
Strange thing.	Ntho e makatsang.
She did not want her husband to know.	O ne a sa batle hore monna oa hae a tsebe.
I do not want to leave you.	ha ke batle ho o tlohela.
And we will be helpful.	Mme re tla ba le thuso.
So they knew this, and they liked nothing about it.	Kahoo ba ne ba tseba ena, ’me ha baa ka ba rata letho ka eona.
Of course, it can happen from time to time.	Ehlile, e ka etsahala ka linako tse itseng.
There are books about the past, the present, and the future.	Ho na le libuka tse buang ka nako e fetileng, ea joale le ea nako e tlang.
He plays very well.	O bapala hantle haholo.
There is only one truth.	Ke 'nete e le 'ngoe feela e teng.
I could get it anytime.	Ke ne ke khona ho e fumana neng kapa neng.
People understand more.	Batho ba utloisisa haholoanyane.
It was my job.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa ka.
It would not go.	E ne e ke ke ea .
He has seen it for a long time.	E se e le nako e telele esale a e bona.
This whole thing.	Ntho ena kaofela.
It was for the best.	E ne e le bakeng sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Think now.	Nahana ka hona joale.
Then they could decide whether to leave or not.	Joale ba ne ba ka etsa qeto ea hore na o lokela ho tsoa kapa che.
I was happy to be in their team.	Ke ne ke thabile ha ke le sehlopheng sa bona.
No, of course not.	Che, ha e le hantle, ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
If you can talk about it.	Haeba u ka bua ka eona.
It would be the first time, if it were.	E ka be e le lekhetlo la pele, ha e ka ba joalo.
But there is still time.	Empa nako e ntse e le teng.
I want to see more of that though.	Ke batla ho bona ho feta leha ho le joalo.
At that point they took a real place.	Ka nako eo ba ile ba nka sebaka sa sebele.
They were treated that way.	Ba ile ba tšoaroa joalo.
Try to do one of them.	Leka ho etsa e 'ngoe ea tsona.
You are reading a book.	U bala buka.
But this is not enough.	Empa sena ha sea lekana.
He left without saying a word.	O ile a tsamaea a sa bua letho.
They cried in the back.	Ba ile ba lla ka morao.
She's so sweet, really.	O monate, ruri.
They had a great time at the party.	Ba bile le nako e monate haholo moketeng.
Indeed,	Ka sebele,
Obviously, some people will really like this.	Ho hlakile hore batho ba bang ba hlile ba tla rata sena.
I can't really say all that it does.	Ha ke khone ho bolela hantle tsohle tseo e li etsang.
That baby girl will be mine.	Ngoana eo oa ngoanana e tla ba oa ka.
I have to learn them from you.	Ke tlameha ho ithuta tsona ho uena.
I don't know what's going on.	Ha ke tsebe se etsahalang.
She is a woman.	Ke mosali.
Money can help a group to stay healthy.	Chelete e ka thusa sehlopha ho phela hantle.
Some want to go.	Ba bang ba batla ho tsamaea.
So you get the most money for your money.	Kahoo u fumana chelete e ngata ka ho fetisisa bakeng sa chelete ea hau.
He would come.	O ne a tla tla.
It was the first time I had seen that room.	Ke ne ke qala ho bona kamore eo.
When you get the chance, of course.	Ha o fumana monyetla, ehlile.
This should be empty.	Sena se lokela ho ba se nang letho.
Also, you would not ask your parents for help.	Hape u ne u ke ke ua kōpa thuso ho batsoali ba hao.
We only had one car.	Re ne re e-na le koloi e le ’ngoe feela.
We thought we did.	Re ne re nahana hore re entse joalo.
Make sure you tell your friends about us !.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u bolella metsoalle ea hau ka rona!.
He never asked her name.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a botsa lebitso la hae.
He found that he enjoyed the work.	O ile a fumana hore o thabela mosebetsi ona.
That is a real question.	Ke potso ea sebele.
Well done, son.	O entse hantle, mora.
This house is very old.	Ntlo ena ke ea khale haholo.
Well, here it is.	Be, ke eona ena.
He too will be here.	Le eena o tla ba teng mona.
It never happens.	Ha ho mohla e etsahalang.
I will suggest.	Ke tla fana ka tlhahiso.
I often had my own house.	Hangata ke ne ke e-na le ntlo ke le mong.
Seek, and you will find.	Batlang, mme le tla fumana.
But it is true.	Empa ke 'nete.
Just it wasn't there now.	Feela e ne e le sieo hona joale.
Everything had to come from somewhere.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e lokela ho tsoa sebakeng se seng.
The fact is, none of us know.	'Nete ke hore, ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea tsebang hantle.
When you find him, tell him that for me.	Ha u mo fumana, u mo bolelle seo bakeng sa ka.
It did well for me.	E entse hantle ho nna.
But now it was too late.	Empa joale e ne e se e le morao haholo.
He did not know how to make money at all.	O ne a sa tsebe ho etsa chelete ka letho.
It was still a family.	E ne e ntse e le lelapa.
He had to plan.	O ne a lokela ho rera.
It was a good job.	E ne e le mosebetsi o motle.
We offer only one type, there are others.	Re fana ka mofuta o le mong feela, ho na le tse ling.
You would have to if he did not.	U ne u tla tlameha haeba a sa etse joalo.
How they make you do things.	Kamoo li etsang hore u etse lintho kateng.
Things were very good.	Lintho li ne li le ntle haholo.
It did nothing.	Ha ea ka ea etsa letho.
This is not a good time for me.	Ha se nako e ntle ho nna.
Would you like to go with you?	O ka thabela ho tsamaea le uena?
We were able to talk.	Re ile ra khona ho bua.
It happened.	Ho ile ha etsahala.
The teacher is very difficult.	Tichere e thata haholo.
Early in the morning.	Ho sa le hoseng.
What it meant.	Seo e neng e se bolela.
The day before.	Ka letsatsi le fetileng.
However, there was no such power.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se na matla a joalo.
He doesn't do it that way, of course.	Ha A e etse ka tsela eo, ehlile.
That's the job.	Ke mosebetsi oo.
There was so much to learn.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo re lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
That road no longer exists.	Tsela eo ha e sa le teng.
It's a party.	Ke mokete.
He has done that before.	O kile a etsa joalo pele.
Whatever was coming at that time, he did not know.	Eng kapa eng e neng e tla ka nako eo, o ne a sa e tsebe.
It was beautiful.	E ne e le ntle.
Take your clothes with you.	Nka liaparo tsa hao le uena.
We do not know his name.	Ha re tsebe lebitso la hae.
He paused.	A ema hanyane.
He didn't know there.	O ne a sa tsebe moo.
I'm crying and she's here.	Ke lla mme o teng mona.
I will say so much for her, too.	Ke tla bua hakaalo bakeng sa hae, hape.
However, it is not something of my type.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se ntho ea mofuta oa ka.
You like it.	Ua e rata.
Stop and think for a moment.	Ema 'me u nahane ho se hokae.
This was something new to me.	Ena e ne e le ntho e ncha ho 'na.
There was no food.	Ho ne ho se na lijo.
He can go on.	A ka tsoela pele ho.
It's more fun than that.	Ho monate ho feta moo.
I think we are too.	Ke nahana hore le rona re joalo.
I hope to see you there.	Ke tšepa ho u bona moo.
Her beautiful clothes.	Liaparo tsa hae tse ntle.
Thanks again to the whole team.	Ke leboha hape sehlopha sohle.
We did not understand it and understand it.	Re ne re sa e utloisise le ho e utloisisa.
Look before it is too late.	Sheba pele e e-ba morao haholo.
It does not take long.	Ha ho nke nako e telele.
Many more actually.	Tse ling tse ngata ha e le hantle.
I would appreciate any help.	Ke tla leboha thuso efe kapa efe.
We were learning a lot from it.	Re ne re ntse re ithuta lintho tse ngata ho eona.
Excited, he wanted it.	A thabile, o ile a e batla.
But it may not be so easy.	Empa mohlomong ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
And yours.	Le ea hau.
They gave us the money we needed to get the job done.	Ba ile ba re fa chelete eo re neng re e hloka ho etsa mosebetsi oo.
It goes beyond the law.	E feta molao.
Let me think.	E re ke nahane.
Great fun too.	Monate o moholo hape.
It maintains and works well.	E boloka le ho sebetsa hantle.
Yet it could have been worse.	Leha ho le joalo e ka be e bile mpe le ho feta.
They were even able to talk to them.	Ba ne ba bile ba khona ho bua le bona.
I'm not sure why, but it is.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na hobaneng ho le joalo, empa ho joalo.
To be too close.	Ho ba haufi haholo.
One thing was real.	Ntho e le 'ngoe e ne e le ea sebele.
I need to talk to you about some things.	Ke hloka ho bua le uena ka lintho tse ling.
It was his.	E ne e le tsa hae.
If you want.	Haeba u batla.
He has always been good to me.	Haesale a le molemo ho nna.
And another group.	Le sehlopha se seng.
Either way, this is true.	Ka tsela e 'ngoe, sena ke' nete.
I hope help comes, though.	Ke tšepa hore thuso ea tla, leha ho le joalo.
I did not.	Ke ne ke sa.
I find her pretty.	Ke mo fumana a le motle.
In the end we are too many.	Qetellong re ba bangata haholo.
When they finally finished, no one was going to buy it.	Qetellong ha ba e qeta, ho ne ho se motho ea tla e reka.
They went from house to house.	Ba ne ba kena ntlo le ntlo.
They are not sure what to expect.	Ha ba na bonnete ba hore na ba ka lebella eng.
Do not say anything.	O seke wa bua letho.
Take care of the dog.	Hlokomela ntja.
And you can't do that unless you know who that person is.	'Me u ke ke ua etsa joalo ntle le haeba u tseba hore na motho eo ke mang.
Someone will drive a better car.	Motho e mong o tla khanna koloi e betere.
So, what are you waiting for?	Joale, u emetse eng?
Look after watching.	Sheba ka mor'a ho shebella.
Of course, they worked well, but they were also very heavy.	Ehlile, li ne li sebetsa hantle, empa hape li ne li le boima haholo.
Be real.	Eba oa sebele.
We do our best.	Re etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
She does not like help.	Ha a rate thuso.
He was not well.	O ne a sa phela hantle.
To make him do what he wants him to do.	Ho etsa hore e etse seo a batlang hore e se etse.
Nobody likes him.	Ha ho motho ea mo ratang.
And she was there but also not there.	Mme o ne a le teng empa hape a le sieo.
And they talk a lot.	'Me ba bua haholo.
Some ideas, a certain situation.	Maikutlo a mang, boemo bo itseng.
I found nothing about them.	Ha kea fumana letho ka tsona.
I want another chance.	Ke batla monyetla o mong.
People want to spend more money on groceries.	Batho ba batla ho sebelisa chelete e ngata ho reka lijo.
I think they can.	Ke nahana hore ba ka khona.
I'm very good at people who are good to me.	Ke hantle haholo ho batho ba molemo ho nna.
I just said it.	Ke sa tsoa e bua.
We see bad things.	Re bona lintho tse mpe.
That would be convincing.	Seo se ne se tla kholisa.
Or it may not be possible, and he may not live long.	Kapa ho ke ke ha etsahala, ’me a ka ’na a se ke a phela nako e telele.
It was something he had never thought of before.	E ne e le ntho eo a neng a sa e nahane pele.
He could not see at all.	O ne a sa bone ho hang.
I will read this.	Ke tla bala sena.
They do not exist.	Ha li eo.
The same is true with power.	Ho joalo le ka matla.
Perhaps he did not know how to refuse.	Mohlomong o ne a sa tsebe ho hana.
You may find it difficult to believe this.	U ka ’na ua fumana ho le thata ho lumela sena.
He drank his coffee and breakfast.	O ile a noa kofi le lijo tsa hae tsa hoseng.
He just didn't have the sun.	O ne a se na letsatsi feela.
Or maybe he finally understood something about her.	Kapa mohlomong qetellong o ne a utloisisa ho hong ka eena.
It hurts so much for them.	Ho bohloko haholo bakeng sa bona.
That would not have happened.	Seo se ne se ke ke sa etsahala.
Some will pass.	Ba bang ba tla feta.
The same was true of other householders.	Ho ne ho le joalo le ka batho ba bang ba ntlo.
They had nothing.	Ba ne ba se na letho.
You have to go that way.	U lokela ho tsoela pele ka tsela eo.
Be careful!	Hlokomela!
Please be someone we know.	Ke kopa e be motho eo re mo tsebang.
We learned what that and other things can do.	Re ile ra ithuta hore na seo le lintho tse ling li ka etsa eng.
I would not need that, thank you.	Nka se hloke seo, kea leboha.
I thought that was a good thing.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e ne e le taba e ntle eo.
We just have to move on.	Re tlameha ho tsoela pele feela.
He does not like that.	Ha A rate seo.
His friends caught up.	Metsoalle ea hae e ile ea tšoara.
It finally arrived.	Qetellong ea fihla.
He tried coffee, but the coffee did not help.	O ile a leka kofi, empa kofi ha ea ka ea thusa leha e le efe.
It wasn't the same.	E ne e se hona hoo.
To keep his life together.	Ho boloka bophelo ba hae hammoho.
I was very close.	Ke ne ke le haufi haholo.
Or exactly like.	Kapa hantle joalo ka.
Where are you going this time?	U tla ea kae ka nako ee.
To be honest, we do.	Ho bua ’nete, le rōna re etsa joalo.
They were so beautiful.	Li ne li le ntle haholo.
I did not like your work and took the opportunity to quit.	Ke ne ke sa rate mosebetsi oa hau mme ka nka monyetla oa ho tlohela.
They got it.	Ba e fumane.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
It would certainly be new if it were.	Ka sebele e ne e tla ba e ncha haeba e ne e le teng.
This we cannot do.	Sena ha re khone ho se etsa.
I mean so.	Ke bolela hore ho joalo.
Try not to sit down.	Leka hore u se ke ua lula fatše.
It should be the first thing you want.	E lokela ho ba ntho ea pele eo u e batlang.
I'm glad you're here.	Ke thabela hore o teng.
You told them.	U ba boleletse.
Nice idea, the writing style is great.	Maikutlo a monate, mokhoa oa ho ngola o motle haholo.
Or that’s how it would start, though.	Kapa ke kamoo e neng e tla qala, leha ho le joalo.
Do you really have reason to feel this way?	Na ka sebele o na le lebaka la ho ikutloa ka tsela ee?
We will continue to do this.	Re tla tsoela pele ho etsa sena.
He did not have his own life.	O ne a se na bophelo ba hae.
Then we ask ourselves questions.	Ebe joale re ipotsa lipotso.
Now you are not.	Joale ha u joalo.
They take time, but they are not difficult.	Li nka nako, empa ha li thata.
All and all will come back.	Tsohle le bohle ba tla khutla.
What you do goes beyond that.	Seo u se etsang se feta moo.
When he heard that, he wept.	Ha a utloa seo, a lla.
You can look at him.	U ka mo sheba.
Some are coming.	Ba bang ba ntse ba tla.
I don't see anything right now.	Ha ke bone letho hona joale.
I had to leave.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tsamaea.
He would finish that.	O ne a tla qeta seo.
Keep going.	Tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
However, I do not know how effective that is.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hore na seo se sebetsa hakae.
It's not very good.	Ha e ntle haholo.
He had similar problems.	O bile le mathata a tšoanang.
Our friends work just as well.	Metsoalle ea rona e sebetsa hantle joalo ka ha e le joalo.
It was not going well.	Ho ne ho sa tsamaea hantle.
I did not know they existed until last year.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore li teng ho fihlela selemong se fetileng.
No, we will tell you about them.	Che, re tla u bolella tsona.
I just want to be alone.	Ke mpa feela ke batla ho ba mong.
This did not work very well.	Sena se ne se sa sebetsa hantle haholo.
No, you are not.	Che, ha u so.
It can be anyone, from anywhere.	E ka ba mang kapa mang, ho tsoa kae kapa kae.
What happens.	Ho etsahalang.
You would hear it from anyone who has ever met them.	U ne u tla e utloa ho mang kapa mang ea kileng a kopana le bona.
That is what he would expect.	Ke seo a neng a tla se lebella.
But he is still an expert.	Empa e ntse e le setsebi.
I have found almost everything works.	Ke fumane hoo e ka bang tsohle li sebetsa.
He opened the door of another.	A bula lemati la e 'ngoe.
That place is not lifelong.	Sebaka seo ha se na bophelo bohle.
We can only leave tomorrow.	Re ka tsamaea hosane feela.
They come back and work.	Ba khutla 'me ba sebetsa.
I was there.	Ke ne ke bile teng.
Of course I will do this again.	Ehlile ke tla etsa sena hape.
I'm very sorry	ke masoabi haholo
This is my last chance.	Ona ke monyetla oa ka oa ho qetela.
Anyone could have taken them.	Mang kapa mang a ka be a li nkile.
All thanks.	Tsohle kea leboha.
Yet it still has one of the same issues.	Leha ho le joalo e ntse e na le e 'ngoe ea litaba tse tšoanang.
She looked beautiful.	O ne a shebahala a le motle.
He began to drink heavily.	O ile a qala ho noa haholo.
I want to be a father to my son.	Ke batla ho ba ntate ho mora wa ka.
Time went on.	Nako e ile ea tsoela pele.
This is not difficult.	Sena ha se boima.
The same is true for my parents, of course.	Ho joalo le ka batsoali ba ka, ha e le hantle.
Tell people what you did.	Bolella batho seo u se entseng.
Obviously, people think that is a good idea.	Ho hlakile hore batho ba nahana hore ke mohopolo o motle.
Sadly, that did not happen.	Ka masoabi, ha hoa ka ha bonahala ho le joalo.
I enjoyed doing so.	Ke ile ka thabela ho etsa joalo.
This is mine.	Ena ke ea ka.
Eat enough food.	Ja lijo tse lekaneng.
Very easy to use.	Ho bonolo haholo ho e sebelisa.
I thought it was you.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke uena.
Not much.	Ha e ngata.
You have to watch it.	U tlameha ho e shebella.
It was fun to see that.	Ho ne ho le monate ho bona seo.
Not sure how it works.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na e sebetsa joang.
It was always a lot of fun for the kids.	Kamehla ho ne ho le monate haholo ho bana.
And you do not have to think.	Hape ha ho hlokahale hore u nahane.
That's the way he loved it.	Ke tsela eo a neng a e rata ka eona.
I hope you are well.	Ke tšepa hore u ntse u phela hantle.
The good news.	Litaba tse molemo.
It really was a good job.	Ruri e ne e le mosebetsi o motle.
I only look ahead to myself.	Ke sheba pele ho nna feela.
If you mean the law, of course.	Haeba u bolela molao, ka sebele.
I looked again.	Ka sheba hape.
See car missing.	Bona koloi e sieo.
They are beautiful	Ba batle
We cannot continue like that.	Re ke ke ra tsoela pele joalo.
Very important things.	Lintho tsa bohlokoa haholo.
We think it could be somehow.	Re nahana hore e ka ba ka tsela e itseng.
People know that.	Batho ba tseba seo.
It's not kind.	Ha se mofuta.
So, you have reason to try them.	Kahoo, u na le lebaka la ho ba leka.
The situation was simple.	Boemo bo ne bo le bonolo.
But he knew.	Empa o ne a tseba.
He started drinking.	O ile a qala ho noa.
This seems easier said than done.	Sena se bonahala se le bonolo ho se bua ho feta ho se etsa.
Each one of us.	E mong le e mong wa rona.
He did not know what to believe.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a lumele eng.
The line was very strong.	Mohala o ne o le matla haholo.
The way to take care of them is one.	Mokhoa oa ho li hlokomela ke o mong.
Hold your position.	Tšoara boemo ba hau.
Money was not enough.	Chelete e ne e sa lekana.
Many people predicted that this would not happen.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba bolela esale pele hore sena se ke ke sa etsahala.
It could have been later than that.	E ka be e bile morao ho feta moo.
Like me.	Joalo ka ho nna.
It means you could see through them.	Ho bolela hore u ne u ka bona ka tsona.
I want the first one.	Ke batla ea pele.
He did not expect that.	O ne a sa lebella seo.
It will be me and my girl.	E tla ba 'na le ngoanana oa ka.
She started to get dressed.	A qala ho apara.
I think you will too.	Ke nahana hore le uena u tla etsa joalo.
But it was fun.	Empa ho bile monate.
He got home.	A fihla hae.
He felt uncertain about what to do.	O ne a ikutloa a sa tsebe hantle hore na a etse eng.
It will be fun.	Ho tla ba monate.
He's home now, boy.	O hae jwale, moshanyana.
Next week, we'll be back to work.	Bekeng e tlang, re tla khutlela mosebetsing o teng.
I thought this worked, a lot of people didn't work.	Ke ne ke nahana hore sena se sebetsa, batho ba bangata ha baa ka ba sebetsa.
He got his money that he got.	O ile a fumana chelete ea hae eo a ileng a e fumana.
Yes, you need a new one.	E, u hloka e ncha.
He really meant that.	O ne a hlile a bolela seo.
It's a very fun group.	Ke sehlopha se monate haholo.
That was the case at school.	Ho ne ho bile joalo sekolong.
We have a dog.	Re na le ntja.
You did not return.	Ha ua ka ua khutla.
There is not enough money.	Ha ho na chelete e lekaneng.
You are not what they are.	Ha o seo ba leng sona.
Now be well.	Jwale eba hantle.
I am the one who wants.	Ke 'na ea batlang.
It's not my problem.	Ha se bothata ba ka.
I finally realized this and decided to do something about it.	Qetellong ke ile ka hlokomela sena ’me ka etsa qeto ea ho etsa ho hong ka hona.
I have been suffering for years.	Ke na le lilemo ke utloa bohloko bona.
It is a beautiful house.	Ke ntlo e ntle.
But we could go on and on, if we could stay here longer.	Empa re ka tsoela pele mohlomong, ha re ka lula mona nako e telele.
I doubt that will be easy.	Ke belaela hore hoo ho tla ba bonolo.
No one suggested that it was necessary.	Ha ho na motho ea ileng a etsa tlhahiso ea hore ho hlokahala.
It does not exist, but it does exist.	Ha e eo, empa e teng.
We have an idea of ​​the way we want to get into it.	Re na le mohopolo oa tsela eo re batlang ho kena ho eona.
I don't like it either.	Le 'na ha ke e rate.
Do not tell others.	U se ke ua bolella ba bang.
You know you want to.	Ua tseba hore ua batla.
It is easy to see why.	Ho bonolo ho bona lebaka.
We did not stay here long.	Ha rea ​​​​ka ra lula mona nako e telele.
Too much.	E ngata haholo.
If you do.	Haeba u etsa joalo.
Don't do that.	O seke wa etsa seo.
This would be more effective.	Sena se ne se tla sebetsa haholoanyane.
This is the most important.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
He always expresses his feelings.	O bua maikutlo a hae kamehla.
Love your ideas.	Rata maikutlo a hau.
I wanted to eat them.	Ke ne ke batla ho li ja.
We can go home.	Re ka ea hae.
I'm not so sure.	Ha ke na bonnete hakaalo.
You have to think about that.	U lokela ho nahana ka seo.
I knew this could happen.	Ke ne ke tseba hore sena se ka etsahala.
We are human.	Re motho.
It is your job to discover what that is and to bring it about.	Ke mosebetsi oa hau ho bolella motho e mong le e mong ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
But here I am.	Empa ke nna eo.
But then I got it.	Empa joale ke ile ka e fumana.
That must have been a wonderful time.	E tlameha ebe hoo e ne e le nako e monate e fetileng.
We never had anything.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra ba le letho.
And dad.	Le ntate.
I want that for all my kids.	Ke batla seo bakeng sa bana ba ka kaofela.
They paid their dues.	Ba ile ba lefa chelete ea bona.
The room was simple.	Kamore e ne e le bonolo.
We have a problem.	Re na le bothata.
No one understood how bad it was unless they were present.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a utloisisa hore na ho ne ho le mpe hakae ntle le hore ba be teng.
I always feel like there is something or someone around me.	Ke lula ke utloa eka ho na le ntho kapa motho e mong o haufi le nna.
Kick ass.	E monate haholo.
I was beginning to feel that way.	Ke ne ke qala ho ikutloa joalo.
This works.	Sena sea sebetsa.
I am often useless.	Hangata ha ke na thuso.
His mind was somewhere else.	Kelello ea hae e ne e le sebakeng se seng.
He refuses to comment on the situation.	O hana ho bua ka boemo boo.
It looks very nice.	E shebahala e le ntle haholo.
I have met only one.	Ke kopane le a le mong feela.
I stared at him for a long time.	Ke ile ka mo sheba nako e telele.
That person would be gone.	Motho eo o ne a tla be a ile.
It is not just us.	Hase rona feela.
I was not there for them.	Ke ne ke se teng ho bona.
That's what his family was like.	Ke seo lelapa la hae le neng le le sona.
These are very important things.	Tsena ke lintho tsa bohlokoa haholo.
Are you working? 	Na u ntse u sebetsa?
.	.
He could not sleep.	O ne a sitoa ho robala.
It is very easy to stay home.	Ho bonolo haholo ho lula hae.
It’s best to keep simple things simple.	Ho molemo ho boloka lintho tse bonolo li le bonolo.
Three per room.	Tse tharo ho ea ka kamoreng.
To be difficult.	Ho ba thata.
It's one thing to ride.	Ke ntho e le 'ngoe ea ho palama.
Well, you get the same mistake.	Hantle, u fumana phoso e tšoanang.
And she is alive.	Mme o a phela.
I was alone all that time.	Ke ne ke le mong ka nako eo eohle.
He had seen it.	O ne a e bone.
All of this is news to him.	Tsena tsohle ke litaba ho eena.
I hope to find one of these soon.	Ke tšepa ho fumana e 'ngoe ea tsena haufinyane.
It is a very powerful force.	Ke matla a matla haholo.
Then say it again.	Ebe o e bua hape.
Visit without his help.	Etela ntle le thuso ea hae.
He had this.	O ne a ena le sena.
Just a thought.	Mohopolo feela.
He never treated her well but stayed with her nonetheless.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a mo tšoara hantle empa o ile a lula le eena leha ho le joalo.
No problems of any kind.	Ha ho mathata a mofuta ofe kapa ofe.
Lots of time to think.	Nako e ngata ea ho nahana.
You'll never Walk Alone.	U ka se tsamaee u le mong.
These are children.	Bana ke bana.
He was alive.	O ne a phela.
We want what we do not have.	Re batla seo re se nang sona.
He didn't seem happy about it.	O ne a sa bonahale a thabile ka hona.
That's really my problem.	Ke bothata ba ka ruri.
How do you do.	U etsa joang.
You do not have to take it for granted.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u e nke e le ntho leha e le efe.
Their decision and their course are not certain.	Qeto ea bona le tsela ea bona ha li na bonnete ka seo.
They were certainly alone.	Ka sebele ba ne ba le bang.
She never talked about what happened to her.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka se etsahetseng ho eena.
This method works well.	Mokhoa ona o sebetsa hantle.
He decided not to allow it.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore a se ke a e lumella.
And it is still not enough.	Mme e ntse e sa lekana.
I just decide how I feel.	Ke mpa feela ke etsa qeto ea hore na ke ikutloa joang.
The work took several hours.	Mosebetsi oo o ile oa nka lihora tse ’maloa.
We have a wonderful time.	Re na le nako e monate.
He watched the children play.	O ile a shebella bana ba bapala.
Please do not come to me.	Ke kopa o se ke oa tla ho 'na.
I will not trust anyone.	Ha ke na ho tšepa motho.
And that was not something that could happen anytime soon.	Hape hoo e ne e se ntho e ka etsahalang haufinyane.
He wanted to give without taking.	O ne a batla ho fana ntle le ho nka.
He was just so clear.	O ne a mpa a hlakile haholo.
That's not it.	Ha se seo.
He was there.	O ne a le teng.
He often is.	Hangata o joalo.
So this is probably your problem.	Kahoo sena mohlomong ke bothata ba hau.
What's wrong with you people ?.	Phoso ke eng ka lona batho?.
It looked like my age.	E ne e shebahala e le lilemo tsa ka.
However, it does not matter.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho na taba.
He spent his busy days at work.	O ne a qeta matsatsi a hae a phathahane mosebetsing.
This is the fourth week.	Ena ke beke ea bone.
I've been thinking about you for a long time.	Ke khale ke ntse ke nahana ka uena.
I have not won.	Ha kea hlola.
I used to do that.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ho etsa joalo.
I love her very, very much.	Ke mo rata haholo, haholo.
Think for a moment.	Nahana ho se hokae.
Without taking what it is.	Ntle le ho nka seo e leng sona.
You do everything you have to do.	U etsa sohle seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
You never did.	Ha o eso ka o etsa jwalo.
For others, it may not be.	Bakeng sa tse ling, ho ka 'na ha se ke ha e-ba joalo.
I love his work.	Ke rata mosebetsi oa hae.
Sometimes they are ahead of their time.	Ka linako tse ling ba ka pele ho nako ea bona.
I wondered if he would survive.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na o tla phela ka eona.
I can use one.	Nka sebelisa e le 'ngoe.
We work together, but we also play together.	Re sebetsa hammoho, empa hape re bapala hammoho.
Then he started.	Eaba o qala.
He said he wanted to retire.	O ile a re o batla ho tlohela mosebetsi.
However, it is not in my area.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se sebakeng sa ka.
And that's it.	Mme ke ntho eo.
Many people have trouble sleeping.	Batho ba bangata ba na le bothata ba ho robala.
He worked well and slept a lot.	O ne a sebetsa hantle mme a robala hangata.
This is very simple.	Sena se bonolo haholo.
That may or may not happen.	Seo se ka etsahala kapa se se ke sa etsahala.
That's a good thing.	Ke ntho e monate.
Start somewhere else.	Qala hape sebakeng se seng.
The children are crying.	Bana baa lla.
Back to work.	Khutlela mosebetsing.
That's what kids do.	Ke seo bana ba se etsang.
He didn't even think I was strong.	O ne a bile a sa nahane hore ke ka matla.
We will need people like you.	Re tla hloka batho ba kang uena.
I tried to be nice.	Ke ile ka leka ho ba motle.
It would have been worse.	E ka be e bile mpe.
They are children.	Ke bana.
He had taken from them yesterday.	O ne a nkile ho tsona maobane.
However, it was not fun.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se monate.
This state of affairs cannot continue.	Boemo bona ba lintho bo ke ke ba tsoela pele.
He is a strong and curious child.	Ke ngoana ea matla le ea ratang ho tseba.
We do not believe this.	Ha re lumele sena.
I hope they enjoy it there.	Ke tšepa hore ba tla e thabela moo.
I felt uncertain about where the ground level was.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke sa tsebe hantle hore na boemo ba fatše bo hokae.
However, it has its ups and downs.	Leha ho le joalo, e na le linako tsa eona.
So it would be.	Kahoo ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
But he was someone they knew.	Empa e ne e le motho eo ba neng ba mo tseba.
Each of them said he would spend it with the family.	E mong le e mong oa bona o itse o tla e qeta le ba lelapa.
I was really not thinking very well.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa nahane hantle.
But that would be a mistake.	Empa hoo e ka ba phoso.
It can be anything.	E ka ba eng kapa eng.
I hope to see you then !.	Ke tšepa ho u bona ka nako eo!.
Maybe it would be best.	Mohlomong ho ka ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
It doesn't do it.	Ha e e etse.
I mean think about it.	Ke bolela hore nahana ka eona.
I'm older than you, however it is not a bad thing.	Ke moholo ho uena, leha ho le joalo ha se ntho e mpe.
I like to think about them.	Ke rata ho nahana ka tsona.
I will go out.	Ke tlo tsoa.
Without it, he would have nothing.	Ntle ho eona, o ne a ke ke a ba le letho.
I'm from another.	Ke tsoa ho e 'ngoe.
Eventually, he decided to try another method.	Qetellong, o ile a etsa qeto ea ho leka mokhoa o mong.
I write a lot.	Ke ngola haholo.
He really did it.	O hlile o e entse.
I know you will.	Kea tseba hore u tla etsa joalo.
You will understand why.	U tla utloisisa lebaka.
We will continue to do so.	Re tla tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
Or stop.	Kapa ema.
Too much.	E ngata haholo.
You need to make sure you have it all.	U lokela ho ba le bonnete ba hore u na le tsohle.
This is one of them.	Ena ke e 'ngoe ea tsona.
Make time.	Etsa nako.
I know what he looks like.	Kea tseba hore na o shebahala joang.
Like you.	Joalo ka uena.
It works well for me.	E sebetsa hantle bakeng sa ka.
But, that did not happen.	Empa, seo ha sea ka sa etsahala.
I want to finish it soon.	Ke batla ho e qeta kapele.
Be a better person.	Eba motho ya betere.
That is clear to me.	Taba eo e hlakile ho nna.
He got it right away.	O ile a e fumana hona hoo.
I really wanted to.	Ke ne ke hlile ke batla.
You have to keep working hard.	U lokela ho tsoela pele ho sebetsa ka thata.
I often wonder how he handled these issues.	Hangata ke ipotsa hore na o nkile litaba tsena joang.
Now is a good time like any other.	Joale ke nako e ntle joalo ka efe kapa efe.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
I'm happy.	ke thabile.
One of us has to talk!	E mong oa rona o tlameha ho bua!
They will refuse.	Ba tla hana.
You know what's there.	U tseba se teng moo.
But, yes, that's the whole point.	Empa, ee, ke eona taba kaofela.
Go on with your life.	Tsoela pele ka bophelo ba hau.
Do not speak again.	O seke wa bua hape.
He could not stay long.	O ne a sitoa ho lula nako e telele.
He did so at dinner.	O ile a etsa joalo nakong ea lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I would say you don't need it.	Nka re ha u e hloke.
I no longer want children.	Ha ke sa batla bana.
I am a child of law.	Ke ngoana oa molao.
He had friends now.	O ne a e-na le metsoalle joale.
The place was close to him.	Sebaka se ne se le haufi le eena.
I will never forget what he did.	Nke ke ka lebala seo a se entseng.
When we leave, he will come with us.	Ha re tsamaea, o tla le rona.
Maybe it was a mistake.	Mohlomong e ne e le phoso.
He seemed to know what he had to do.	Ho ne ho bonahala a tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
But that did not happen.	Empa ha hoa ka ha e-ba joalo.
I know that's good, but.	Kea tseba hore seo se molemo, empa.
I don’t think anyone can.	Ha ke nahane hore ho na le motho ea ka khonang.
Today's group still exists.	Sehlopha sa kajeno se ntse se le teng.
It was one of those questions.	E ne e le e 'ngoe ea lipotso tsa lipotso.
I watch him play a little.	Ke mo shebella ha a e bapala hanyane.
But perhaps you could hear it.	Empa mohlomong u ne u ka e utloa.
You have questions and need help.	U na le lipotso 'me u hloka thuso.
And yet, see it my way.	Mme leha e le teng, e bone ka tsela ya ka.
But nothing happened.	Empa ho ne ho se letho le etsahetseng.
He tried to reach them.	O ile a leka ho ba fihlela.
You should see them.	O lokela ho ba bona.
The young man lives in the same place.	Mohlankana o lula sebakeng se le seng.
She has never had a boyfriend.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba le mohlankana.
I could not function properly.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho sebetsa hantle.
There were some but not many.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse ling empa li se ngata haholo.
I think she will be fine.	Ke nahana hore o tla phela hantle.
You've seen that now.	O bone seo ha jwale.
Living and learning is one thing.	Ho phela le ho ithuta ke ntho e le 'ngoe.
Meet me there once.	Kopana le 'na moo hang.
Of course it is.	Ho hlakile hore ho joalo.
I'm trying to live here.	Ke leka ho phela mona.
No, this is not true.	Che, sena hase 'nete.
There are still too many.	Ho ntse ho e-na le tse ngata haholo.
I really enjoyed this car.	Ke thabetse koloi ena haholo.
There was no way to help them.	Ho ne ho se mokhoa oa ho ba thusa.
I will never forget you.	Nke ke ka o lebala.
She had never loved a man before or since.	O ne a eso rate monna pele kapa ho tloha ka nako eo.
I do not believe.	Ha ke lumele.
Trust his memory.	Tšepa mohopolo oa hae.
However, it can be very difficult to create the image you want.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ka 'na ha e-ba thata haholo ho etsa setšoantšo seo u se batlang.
He made a mistake in continuing to live.	O ile a etsa phoso ea ho tsoela pele a phela.
You will be alone after that.	U tla be u le mong ka mor'a moo.
He would have to stand.	O ne a tla tlameha ho ema.
I hope we will be friends.	Ke tšepa hore re tla ba metsoalle.
She was crying.	O ne a lla.
I'm happy here.	Ke thabile mona.
There was never enough money.	Ho ne ho se mohla chelete e lekaneng.
An image of an object.	Setšoantšo sa ntho.
They trust because they want to, perhaps because they need to.	Ba tšepa hobane ba batla, mohlomong hobane ba hloka.
He doesn't know why.	Ha a tsebe lebaka.
I went looking for him.	Ke ile ka ea mo batla.
I can hear him.	Ke khona ho mo utloa.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
Anyone could see the dog still alive.	Motho leha e le ofe o ne a bona ntja e ntse e le teng.
It's fun to take.	Ho monate ho nka.
So they did.	Kahoo, ba ile ba etsa joalo.
I want you to talk to me.	Ke batla hore o bue le nna.
Not making a decision is a decision.	Ho se etse qeto ke ho etsa qeto.
A sweet mother.	Mme ya monate.
So, everything works fine.	Kahoo, tsohle li sebetsa hantle.
Really bad things.	Lintho tse mpe ruri.
Not that it has to happen.	Ha se hore e lokela ho etsahala.
He wanted a weapon.	O ne a batla sebetsa.
I know what he thinks.	Ke tseba seo a se nahanang.
Money was not the only benefit.	Chelete e ne e se eona feela molemo.
But this could mean problems here.	Empa sena se ka bolela mathata mona.
They were emotional.	Ba ne ba e-na le maikutlo.
That is when he spoke.	Ke ka mor'a moo a ileng a bua.
It will not be worth it at all.	E tla be e sa lokela ho hang.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
We both went our separate ways.	Ka bobeli re ile ra tsamaea ka tsela ea rōna.
Just visit if you need to.	Etela feela ha u hloka.
How long must we wait!	Re tlameha ho ema ho fihlela neng!
It was not a matter of indifference.	E ne e se taba ea ho hloka maikutlo.
Also, thank you very much.	Hape, ke leboha haholo.
Here's the amazing thing.	Taba e makatsang ke ena.
That takes years to take, to learn.	Seo se nka lilemo ho nka, ho ithuta.
I hope you are doing well so far.	Ke tšepa hore u ntse u sebetsa hantle ho fihlela joale.
But he tried that on other people.	Empa o ile a leka seo ho batho ba bang.
Too many questions.	Lipotso tse ngata haholo.
He is here now.	O mona jwale.
This no longer works.	Sena ha se sa sebetsa.
He worked well.	O ne a sebetsa hantle.
I have found it hard to believe that this is true.	Ke fumane ka thata hore sena ke 'nete.
I feel it too.	Le 'na kea e utloa.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se joalo.
I hope you stay here.	Ke tšepa hore u tla lula mona.
Yet you can still feel it.	Leha ho le joalo u ntse u ka ikutloa.
He opened the letter and began to read.	A bula lengolo mme a qala ho bala.
We know we will win.	Rea tseba hore re tla e hlola.
Like more and more food.	Joalo ka lijo tse ngata le ho feta.
I had everyone who wanted it.	Ke ne ke e-na le bohle ba e batlang.
Dad instead of tired.	Ntate ho e-na le ho khathetse.
And my father always cared for her.	'Me ha e le hantle Ntate o ne a mo hlokomela.
He goes with her.	O ea le eena.
But we can't.	Empa ha re khone.
And we do not need problems.	Mme ha re hloke mathata.
But try to stay close to it and get what you can.	Empa leka ho lula haufi le ho fumana seo u ka se khonang.
I do not have a car.	Ha ke na koloi.
He can't stay here.	A ke ke a dula mona.
I will probably be back with Dad.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe ke tla khutlela le Ntate.
He would have to sit down.	O ne a tla tlameha ho lula fatše.
I decided that I would never ask again.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea hore nke ke ka hlola ke kōpa.
Nobody does it better.	Ha ho motho ea e etsang betere.
Think first, read the second.	Nahana pele, bala ea bobeli.
You can take that as you like.	O ka nka seo kamoo o ratang kateng.
The road is very dangerous.	Tsela e kotsi haholo.
Time to think.	Nako ea ho nahana.
So it seems to work for me.	Kahoo e bonahala e sebetsa ho nna.
So I said no.	Kahoo ke ile ka re che.
It could not find him.	E ne e ke ke ea mo fumana.
This coming week will be even better.	Beke ena e tlang e tla ba betere le ho feta.
That was just a job for him.	Oo e ne e le mosebetsi feela ho eena.
It would have been fun.	E ka be e bile monate.
The phone was ringing loudly.	Mohala o ne o lla haholo.
And our people.	Le batho ba rona.
We would love to hear your thoughts !.	Re ka thabela ho utloa maikutlo a hau!.
Very scared.	Tšaba haholo.
All of us.	Tsa rona kaofela.
They could not expect that.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba lebella seo.
I get dressed again and call my boyfriend.	Ke apara hape mme ke letsetsa mohlankana oa ka.
Look outside.	Sheba ka ntle.
But we may not do that.	Empa re ka 'na ra se ke ra etsa joalo.
Yes, of course, if you wish.	E, ho hlakile, haeba u lakatsa.
I can take it or leave it.	Nka e nka kapa ka e tlohela.
He is in them.	O ho bona.
I did not understand them.	Ke ne ke sa li utloisise.
Otherwise they would have no mother at all.	Ho seng joalo ba ka be ba se na ’mè ho hang.
No one has ever taken them.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a li nka.
We did not believe them.	Re ne re sa ba lumele.
I just don't know anything.	Ke mpa ke sa tsebe letho.
He had his place.	O ne a ena le sebaka sa hae.
And this takes a very long time.	'Me sena se nka nako e telele haholo.
So, you know, he's almost very important.	Ka hona, ua tseba, o batla a le bohlokoa haholo.
We are sure he is guilty.	Re na le bonnete ba hore o molato.
As you can see, you seem to be able to forget everything.	Joalo ka ha u ka rata, ho bonahala u ke ke ua lebala tsohle.
That's right, even more so.	Ho joalo, le ho feta.
As you do.	Joalo ka ha u etsa.
Better to refuse, he thought.	Ho molemo ho hana, o ile a nahana.
Don't think about that.	O seke oa nahana ka seo.
I went to a house party with some friends.	Ke ile ka ea moketeng oa ntlo le metsoalle e 'maloa.
It's not her fault.	Ha se molato oa hae.
He had been in this place before.	O ne a kile a ba sebakeng sena.
Of course, people donate.	Ha e le hantle, batho ba fana ka tsona.
That would be a very good thing.	Hoo e ka ba ntho e ntle haholo.
But there was nobody there.	Empa ho ne ho se na motho.
This was not true.	Sena e ne e se 'nete.
Please do not make this your case.	Ke kopa o seke oa etsa taba ena taba ea hau.
You know what they say.	U tseba seo ba se buang.
I do not understand the situation better than you.	Ha ke utloisise boemo ho feta uena.
However, his career is in jeopardy.	Leha ho le joalo, mosebetsi oa hae o na le mathata.
First of all, he learns.	Pele ho tsohle, oa ithuta.
They are not.	Ha ba eo.
However, thank you for all your help.	Leha ho le joalo, ke leboha thuso ea hau eohle.
They studied hard.	Ba ile ba ithuta ka thata.
You could do anything.	O ne o ka etsa eng kapa eng.
Same as yours.	E tšoanang le ea hau.
Then we realized that someone had gone.	Eaba rea ​​hlokomela hore motho e mong o ne a ile.
I love her so much.	Ke mo rata haholo.
They provide very tasty food.	Ba fana ka lijo tse monate haholo.
Of course we had good times.	Ehlile re bile le linako tse monate.
However, we do.	Leha ho le joalo, re etsa joalo.
Like last night.	Joalo ka bosiu bo fetileng.
My wife will not enjoy that at all.	Mosali oa ka a ke ke a thabela seo ho hang.
Because what people want in the end is not a book.	Hobane seo batho ba se batlang qetellong hase buka.
You have no other options.	Ha u na lintho tse ling hape.
That is something he could not do.	Ke eona ntho eo a neng a ke ke a e etsa.
And maybe even meet right away.	Mme mohlomong le ho kopana hang hang.
I feel your pain.	Ke utloa bohloko ba hao.
But he was still aware of things.	Empa o ne a ntse a hlokomela lintho.
He did not want her.	O ne a sa mo batle.
I'm not sure it works.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore e ea sebetsa.
But he did not want it.	Empa o ne a sa e batle.
Here is the group to help with the question.	Mona ke sehlopha seo ho thusa ka potso.
This is a very real thing.	Ena ke ntho ea sebele haholo.
One has to do something about that.	Motho o lokela ho etsa ho hong ka seo.
You just got it.	O sa tsoa ba le eona.
We start with the first of these.	Re qala ka ea pele ho tsena.
Tired, it's mine.	E khathetse, ke ea ka.
We do not need it.	Ha re e hloke.
It's so easy !.	Ho bonolo joalo!.
He clapped his hands.	A mo kopa ka matsoho.
I can do well.	Nka etsa hantle.
The important thing is that they are always there.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore li lula li le teng.
Here was a place.	Mona e ne e le sebaka.
I did not understand anyone around me.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise motho leha e le ofe haufi le ’na.
You will have to be.	O tla lokela ho ba jwalo.
So, you know, it starts happening.	Ka hona, le a tseba, e qala ho etsahala.
I can't think of the last time that happened.	Ha ke nahane ka lekhetlo la ho qetela seo se etsahetseng.
Na u ne u.	Na u ne u.
We did everything right.	Re entse tsohle hantle.
I will stay here.	Ke tla lula mona.
Many of them are.	Ba bangata ba bona ba.
Now you know why.	Jwale o tseba lebaka.
He had an idea.	O ne a na le mohopolo.
She is heavy.	O boima.
Some people may like this.	Batho ba bang ba ka rata sena.
I don't think that's what he wanted.	Ha ke nahane hore ke seo a neng a se batla.
I like work.	Ke rata mosebetsi.
But there is another reason why we should go there.	Empa ho na le lebaka le leng leo re lokelang ho ea moo.
They are the last to leave.	Ke bona ba ho qetela ho tsamaea.
Then they drove away.	Eaba ba tsamaea ka koloi.
She watched her children play happily together.	O ile a shebella ha bana ba hae ba ntse ba bapala hammoho ba thabile.
One man.	Monna a le mong.
If there is a mistake, can you tell me?	Haeba ho na le phoso, na o ka mpolella?
It would be better if it were you.	Ho ka ba molemo ha e ne e le uena.
More than ever.	Ho feta moo ho feta neng kapa neng.
You can do a lot of real things then.	U ka etsa lintho tse ngata tsa 'nete ka nako eo.
I don't care what anyone says.	Ha ke tsotelle seo motho e mong a se buang.
I had a wonderful day.	Ke bile le letsatsi le monate.
Maybe we'll go to the future.	Mohlomong re tla ea nakong e tlang.
There was no news.	Ho ne ho se na litaba.
She had just finished her homework.	O ne a qetile mosebetsi oa hae oa sekolo.
But don't stop talking here.	Empa o seke wa ema ho bua mona.
People were coming and going.	Batho ba ne ba ntse ba tla ba bile ba tsamaea.
I saw him pass by.	Ke ile ka mo bona ha a feta.
Just what was needed.	Feela se neng se hlokahala.
He did his job very well.	O entse mosebetsi wa hae hantle haholo.
What you said.	Seo u se buileng.
I did not do so well.	Ha kea etsa joalo hantle.
I hope there is a better way to do this.	Ke tšepa hore ho na le mokhoa o betere oa ho etsa sena.
For us, nothing is more important.	Ho rona, ha ho letho le bohlokoa ho feta.
I needed new shoes.	Ke ne ke hloka lieta tse ncha.
More than that?	Ho feta eng?
One with water.	E 'ngoe ka metsi.
But you probably have it too.	Empa mohlomong le uena u na le eona.
However, you should get this.	Leha ho le joalo, o lokela ho fumana sena.
It was a tool.	E ne e le sebetsa.
Definitely a good place to start.	Ka sebele ke sebaka se setle sa ho qala.
That is if you want my help.	Ke hore haeba u batla thuso ea ka.
To me, this long-term application works well.	Ho 'na, kopo ena ea nako e telele e sebetsa hantle.
It stands for insignificance.	E emetse ho se bohlokoa.
It is important for such a boy.	Bohlokoa ho moshanyana ea joalo.
I'm still thinking about it.	Ke ntse ke nahana ka eona.
We pick up the phone and call someone.	Re nka mohala ebe re letsetsa motho e mong.
This is the first time you have seen his image.	Ke lekhetlo la pele u bona setšoantšo sa hae.
But perhaps no one will.	Empa mohlomong ha ho motho ea tla etsa joalo.
She may have had children.	E ka ’na eaba o ne a e-na le bana.
Read that carefully.	Bala seo hantle.
They don't know what's going to happen.	Ha ba tsebe se tla etsahala.
He always helped us.	Kamehla o ne a re thusa.
But nothing like that happened that day.	Empa ha ho letho le joalo le ileng la etsahala ka letsatsi leo.
He tried one last time.	O ile a leka lekhetlo la ho qetela.
He knows what they can do, and what they have done.	O tseba seo ba ka se etsang, le seo ba se entseng.
It must have been a financial issue.	E tlameha ebe e ne e le taba ea chelete.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	O ne a tseba hantle seo a se etsang.
She decided not to tell him.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho se mo bolelle.
Maybe that would work.	Mohlomong seo se ka sebetsa.
No, that's just it.	Che, ho joalo feela.
We do not know how far.	Ha re tsebe hore na ho fihla hokae.
That was a close line, he thought.	Eo e ne e le mohala o haufi, a nahana.
The young man must get his money back.	Mohlankana o tlameha ho fumana chelete ea hae.
Often what he did was nothing.	Hangata seo a se entseng e ne e se letho.
I know that was not easy.	Kea tseba hore hoo ho ne ho se bonolo.
You need it more than anyone else.	U e hloka ho feta mang kapa mang.
Everyone should learn to write.	E mong le e mong o lokela ho ithuta ho ngola.
Let this place be.	Sebaka sena se be teng.
He saw it too.	Le eena o ile a e bona.
We find that too.	Le rona re fumana seo.
Or something similar.	Kapa ntho e tšoanang.
Imagine if they did that.	Nahana hore na ba ile ba etsa joalo.
The young man continued.	Mohlankana o ile a tsoela pele.
I wonder if we will reach them.	Kea ipotsa hore na re tla ba fihlela.
What he did.	Seo a se entseng.
He did the same with another.	A etsa joalo le ka e mong.
But I did not find it.	Empa ha kea ka ka e fumana.
He did not want to play well with other children.	O ne a sa batle ho bapala hantle le bana ba bang.
The opportunity came and they took it.	Monyetla wa fihla mme ba o nka.
I loved driving at night.	Ke ne ke rata ha re khanna bosiu.
Thank you for reading and hope to see you soon.	Kea leboha ha u bala le ho tšepa ho u bona haufinyane.
I am going to work.	Ke ea mosebetsing.
You can overcome that.	O ka se hlola seo.
He was tired of being alone.	O ne a khathetse ke ho lula a le mong.
I do it again.	Ke e etsa hape.
I do not believe he would have done this to me.	Ha ke lumele hore a ka be a entse sena ho 'na.
The good news was that he could do the same.	Litaba tse monate e ne e le hore le eena a ka etsa se tšoanang.
It's a shame.	Ke lihlong.
That's what he says there.	Ke seo a se buang moo.
This is very important for many people.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo ho batho ba bangata.
Indeed, they often did the same.	Ka sebele, hangata ba ne ba etsa sona seo.
They are equal.	Ba lekana.
Or for money.	Kapa bakeng sa chelete.
And the problem is that.	Mme bothata ke hore.
You, that's right.	Uena, ho joalo.
I'm fine.	Ke phela hantle.
Do your homework.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau oa sekolo.
It was an idea.	E ne e le maikutlo.
Many people have this problem.	Batho ba bangata ba na le bothata bona.
He stared at it for a long time.	A sheba nako e telele.
It's the same time.	Ke nako e tšoanang.
I am here for this.	Ke mona bakeng sa sena.
We will fix this issue.	Re tla lokisa taba ena.
Nor will it be.	Leha e le hore ho tla ba joalo.
They can help.	Li ka thusa.
But it will not happen for long.	Empa e ke ke ea etsahala ka nako e telele.
One of them was a doctor.	E mong oa bona e ne e le ngaka.
But it can be.	Empa ho ka ba jwalo.
He may be a little lonely.	A ka ba bolutu hanyane.
If you lived here you would know that.	Haeba u ne u lula mona u ne u tla tseba seo.
Such a danger exists here.	Kotsi e joalo e teng mona.
But it does not take long to learn.	Empa ha ho nke nako e telele ho ithuta.
I'm not sure how to fix that.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka lokisa seo joang.
No, he could not.	Che, o ne a ka hana.
We all want to do it.	Kaofela re batla ho e etsa.
I would like to know.	Nka thabela ho tseba.
My husband is not one of them.	Monna oa ka ha se e mong oa bona.
He spent a lot of time outdoors.	O ne a qeta nako e ngata a le ka ntle.
I would never do that.	Le ka mohla nke ke ka etsa joalo.
They had to go in and out every day.	Ba ne ba tlameha ho kena le ho tsoa letsatsi le leng le le leng.
It would be up to her to meet him.	E ne e tla ba ho eena ho kopana le eena.
Yet that was the only way.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e le eona feela tsela.
But he did not have it.	Empa o ne a se na eona.
You have to know how to do it.	U tlameha ho tseba ho e etsa.
Most kids love to play with their toys.	Bana ba bangata ba rata ho bapala ka lintho tsa bona tsa ho bapala.
I could have done something else.	Nka be ke entse se seng.
He goes with me.	O tsamaea le 'na.
But he gave a lot of money.	Empa a fana ka chelete e ngata.
A mother should have her own children, she thought.	'Mè o lokela ho ba le bana ba hae, a nahana joalo.
You will not understand it.	U ke ke ua e utloisisa.
They will live a good life.	Ba tla phela bophelo bo monate.
Go now.	Tsamaea hona joale.
I hope you understand.	Ke tšepa hore ua utloisisa.
I understand what they can do.	Ke utloisisa seo ba ka se etsang.
They returned at night.	Ba ne ba khutla bosiu.
My mother, well, mine was very beautiful.	Mme ya ka, hantle, ya ka e ne e le ntle haholo.
We could not enter.	Ha rea ​​khona ho kena.
You see the problem here.	U bona bothata mona.
It feels like him.	E ikutloa joaloka eena.
So we kept looking.	Kahoo re ile ra ’na ra sheba.
But that is what they think.	Empa ke seo ba se nahanang.
We'll see what happens.	Re tla bona se etsahalang.
It was a picture.	E ne e le setšoantšo.
Then he left.	Eaba oa tsamaea.
I have no such mind.	Ha ke na kelello ea mofuta oo.
It would be my first one.	E ne e tla ba oa ka oa pele.
I will be here.	Ke tla ba mona.
He had seen what was going on.	O ne a bone se neng se le teng.
I don't want to be someone else.	Ha ke batle ho ba motho e mong.
Then he looked at us.	Eaba o re sheba.
So they probably don't want it.	Kahoo e ka ’na eaba ha ba e batle.
We use energy from one place to another.	Re sebelisa matla ho tloha sebakeng se seng ho ea ho se seng.
But you know how it goes.	Empa ua tseba hore na ho tsamaea joang.
Spend as much time as you can with him.	Qeta nako e ngata kamoo u ka khonang le eena.
Either way it can work.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe e ka sebetsa.
They could have kept going with that.	Ba ka be ba ile ba tsoela pele ho tsamaea le seo.
I just got it.	Ke sa tsoa e fumana.
So, it is very good.	Kahoo, e ntle haholo.
Everything helps.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e thusa.
He has not yet decided.	Ha a e-so etse qeto.
Some may have questions.	Ba bang ba ka ba le lipotso.
The water here was surprisingly clear.	Metsi a mona a ne a hlakile ka tsela e makatsang.
I have many and good ones.	Ke na le tse ngata le tse ntle.
Don't do that.	O seke wa etsa ntho eo.
This is not the best thing.	Sena ha se ntho e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
That is not a bad thing at all.	Seo ha se ntho e mpe.
For several years.	Ka lilemo tse 'maloa.
I get this every day.	Ke fumana sena letsatsi le letsatsi.
It was a very strange thing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang haholo.
Someone enters the room.	Motho e mong o kena ka phaposing.
Thank you for what you have.	Leboha seo le nang le sona.
There was nothing else he could do.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng leo le ka le etsang.
That's a lot of money.	Ke chelete e ngata haholo.
I was not sure if it would work or not.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na e tla sebetsa kapa che.
There were no problems.	Ho ne ho se na mathata.
I have never known him so happy.	Ha ke eso mo tsebe a thabile hakana.
I did everything the doctor had to do.	Ke entse sohle seo ngaka e lokelang ho se etsa.
It was early in the morning.	E ne e sa le hoseng.
He loves you.	O a o rata.
He finally understood.	Qetellong o ile a utloisisa.
It's fun.	Ho monate.
However, we all know that you never knew.	Leha ho le joalo, bohle rea tseba hore ha ho mohla u kileng ua tseba.
No one knows for sure.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle.
I did not find your question here.	Ha kea fumana potso ea hau mona.
It wasn’t just that it was all my fault.	E ne e se feela hore e ne e le molato oa ka kaofela.
He saw no value.	O ne a bona ho se na thuso.
It was a bit difficult.	Ho ne ho batla ho le boima.
I was a man now.	Ke ne ke le monna jwale.
Thank you for being with us.	Kea leboha ha u bile le rona.
Kopana !.	Kopana!.
Do something carefully.	Etsa ho hong ka hloko.
We may not know for sure.	Re ka 'na ra se ke ra tseba hantle.
Even if they come from me.	Leha li tsoa ho 'na.
Their name means everything.	Lebitso la bona le bolela tsohle.
I don't know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke eng.
The man's hair looked good.	Moriri oa monna o ne o shebahala hantle.
There can still be a way.	Ho ntse ho ka ba le tsela.
Just what he needed.	Feela seo a neng a se hloka.
Every house has these.	Ntlo e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le tsena.
You will know.	O tla tseba.
I did not sleep.	Ha kea ka ka robala.
What mistake did they make?	Ba entse phoso efe?
He stayed there a long time.	A dula moo nako e telele.
It worked often.	E ne e sebetsa hangata.
And the harder you try, the harder it becomes.	Mme ha o leka ka thata, e ba boima le ho feta.
Even if it wasn't me.	Leha e ne e se nna.
Join us.	Kena le rona.
We love to see our old friends again.	Re thabela ho bona metsoalle ea rōna ea khale hape.
I wanted to see what you looked like.	Ke ne ke batla ho bona hore na u shebahala joang.
I knew exactly what to do.	Ke ne ke tseba hantle seo ke lokelang ho se etsa.
Look here, and you will surely find it.	Sheba mona, 'me ka sebele u tla e fumana.
That's the problem.	Ke bothata.
Everything he saw was coming.	Sohle seo a ileng a se bona ke se tlang.
Not everyone can.	Hase bohle ba ka khonang.
But it is more important than that.	Empa e bohlokoa ho feta moo.
He spoke loudly.	O ile a bua ka matla.
Now he can't save anything.	Hona joale ha a khone ho boloka letho.
I'll tell you the same thing.	Ke tla u bolella eona ntho e tšoanang.
This would not have happened.	Sena se ka be se sa etsahala.
Because who knows what is going on.	Hobane ke mang ea tsebang se etsahalang.
I want to be strong.	Ke batla ho ba matla.
I will do it soon.	Ke tla e etsa haufinyane.
It's a simple matter.	Taba e bonolo.
Every mistake is an opportunity to learn.	Phoso e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ke monyetla oa ho ithuta.
No one knows when they will be back.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na ba khutla neng.
He was a helpless man.	Ke motho ea neng a se na thuso.
We became a family.	Re ile ra ba lelapa.
Express your opinion.	Bolela maikutlo a hau.
You do not have to look for something to talk about.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u batle ntho eo u ka buang ka eona.
That would have been better.	Hoo ho ka be ho bile molemo.
Only then did he realize.	Ke ka nako eo feela moo a ileng a utloisisa.
That means it works.	Ho bolela hore e sebetsa.
It was a very strange thing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang haholo.
These are people.	Bana ke batho.
I can't talk to her.	Ha ke khone ho bua le eena.
However, we do not believe so.	Leha ho le joalo, ha re lumele hore ho joalo.
He did a good job as always.	O entse mosebetsi o motle joalo ka kamehla.
We will be able to see it.	Re tla khona ho e bona.
It is his celebration from now on.	Ke mokete wa hae ho tloha jwale.
I was very happy.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho leka hape.
They would speak.	Ba ne ba tla bua.
They should sing for.	Ba lokela ho bina bakeng sa.
I already have a lot, thank you very much.	Ke se ke na le tse ngata, ke leboha haholo.
I know you now.	Ke a o tseba jwale.
It is the mind.	Ke kelello.
His hands were hairy.	Matsoho a hae a ne a le moriri.
I see that as myself.	Ke sheba seo e le nna.
He doesn't think about it.	Ha a nahane ka eona.
It is easy to see why.	Ho bonolo ho bona hore na hobaneng ho le joalo.
It was easy this time.	Ho ne ho le bonolo nakong ena.
I can come back another time.	Nka khutla ka nako e 'ngoe.
I usually suggest taking it all.	Hangata ke fana ka maikutlo a ho nka tsohle.
We have a few questions for you.	Re na le lipotso tse 'maloa bakeng sa hau.
I will not mention it here.	Nke ke ka e bua mona.
How to do other things if.	Mokhoa oa ho etsa lintho tse ling haeba.
Therefore, this method is cost effective.	Ka hona, mokhoa ona ha o na chelete.
But now you know.	Empa joale ua tseba.
Why u.	Hobaneng u.
I sat down and watched them.	Ke ile ka lula fatše 'me ka li shebella.
He was a teacher at a local school.	E ne e le tichere sekolong sa moo.
Why, he just starts.	Hobaneng, o qala feela.
No time to think about it, you know.	Ha ho nako ea ho nahana ka eona, ua tseba.
I find that very interesting.	Ke fumana seo se monate haholo.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
I have always done it.	esale ke e etsa.
Good though.	E ntle leha ho le joalo.
I went to school this morning.	Ke ile sekolong hoseng hona.
Yes, you know the type.	E, u tseba mofuta.
It's from the beginning.	Ke ho tloha pele.
It was another girl with her legs.	E ne e le ngoanana e mong ea nang le maoto a hae.
I can only enjoy it.	Nka thabela feela.
We hope to have that this year.	Re tšepa ho ba le seo selemong sena.
Well, he could not deny that.	Be, o ne a ke ke a hana seo.
The news was not pleasant.	Litaba li ne li se monate.
This process of retaining the memory is fun for everyone.	Mokhoa ona oa ho boloka mohopolo o monate ho bohle.
Check out my location.	Sheba sebaka sa ka.
Well in advance.	Hantle ka pele.
We found you.	Re u fumane.
Let it be.	E ke e be.
Still, I love him.	Leha ho le joalo, kea mo rata.
The fall will happen soon.	Ho oa ho tla etsahala haufinyane.
Just what happens.	Feela se etsahalang.
It wanted to be that way.	E ne e batla ho ba joalo.
Each of us was like that.	E mong le e mong oa rōna o ne a le joalo.
But you do not care.	Empa ha o tsotelle.
They could have tried harder.	Ba ka be ba ile ba leka ka matla ho feta moo.
In real time.	Ka nako ya sebele.
He may not have given his real name.	E ka ’na eaba ha aa ka a fana ka lebitso la hae la sebele.
I didn't want to talk to her either.	Le ’na ke ne ke sa batle ho bua le eena.
It may be the local police.	E ka 'na eaba ke mapolesa a moo.
We are still waiting for it.	Re ntse re e emetse.
We give everyone a chance to speak.	Re fa bohle monyetla oa ho bua.
Well, any fun.	Hantle, monate ofe kapa ofe.
You can do it with your children.	U ka e etsa le bana ba hau.
But he wanted to do just one.	Empa o ne a batla ho etsa e le ’ngoe feela.
Food was plentiful.	Lijo li ne li e-na le lintho tse ngata.
Thank you, baby.	Kea u leboha, ngoana.
You do well.	U etsa hantle.
It did to him.	E entse ho eena.
I will have my coffee.	Ke tla noa kofi ea ka.
To them is to know, and to know is to see.	Ho bona ke ho tseba, mme ho tseba ke ho bona.
We know where you are.	Re tseba moo o leng teng.
He knew that no one would believe him if he told them.	O ne a tseba hore ha ho motho ea tla lumela ha a ka ba bolella.
One can only hope for that.	Motho a ka tšepa joalo feela.
But it is time to move on.	Empa ke nako ea ho tsoela pele.
I really like it.	Ke e rata haholo.
But often, we just can't find it.	Empa hangata, ha re khone ho e fumana.
Just a dog.	Ntja feela.
They will not be with you.	Ba ke ke ba ba le uena.
It is better not to dwell on the past.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua lula u nahana ka lintho tse fetileng.
Someone better do something soon.	Motho e mong betere a etse ho hong haufinyane.
There is no.	Ha ho na.
Other than that, you don't need it.	Ntle ho moo, ha u e hloke.
We had a lot of fun times.	Re bile le linako tse ngata tse monate.
Otherwise.	Ntle le joalo.
It is not the most dangerous group.	Ha se sehlopha sa kotsi ka ho fetisisa.
But this is from me.	Empa sena se tsoa ho 'na.
I got to know him and it was clear there was something wrong.	Ke ile ka mo tseba 'me ho ne ho hlakile hore ho na le phoso.
No one really knows who he was.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle hore na e ne e le mang.
It is a great opportunity for you.	Ke monyetla o moholo ho uena.
This will not work.	Sena se ke ke sa sebetsa.
Otherwise we refuse.	Ho seng joalo re hana.
Then, he had another idea.	Joale, a ba le mohopolo o mong.
Her husband left.	Monna oa hae o ile a tsamaea.
I will pay you.	ke tla o lefa.
I don't know how long.	Ha ke tsebe nako e kae.
he thought.	a nahana.
Or my job.	Kapa mosebetsi oa ka.
Sometimes it went well.	Ka linako tse ling ho ne ho tsamaea hantle.
This is because no one else.	Sena ke hobane ha ho le ea mong.
There is no one like him.	Ha ho motho ea tšoanang le eena.
He knew how he felt.	O ne a tseba hore na o ikutloa joang.
It will come out.	E tla tsoa.
I feel very happy about myself right now.	Ke ikutloa ke thabile haholo ka 'na hona joale.
I suggest they take ours.	Ke etsa tlhahiso ea hore ba nke ea rona.
He was a boy too.	E ne e le moshanyana hape.
I have to say fix the water.	Ke lokela ho re ho lokisa metsi.
This is your situation.	Ena ke boemo ba hau.
There was no law.	Ho ne ho se na molao.
You feel good about these people.	U ikutloa u le motle ka batho bana.
For this, he needs you.	Bakeng sa sena, oa u hloka.
But that didn't matter to the power that was there.	Empa hoo ho ne ho se taba ka matla a neng a le teng.
I know you well.	Ke o tseba hantle.
We are waiting for news.	Re emetse litaba.
You went to your place.	U ile sebakeng sa hau.
He wanted to know what he was thinking.	O ne a batla ho tseba hore na o nahana eng.
He soon found out why.	Kapele o ile a fumana lebaka.
But it is certainly not necessary.	Empa ka sebele ha ho hlokahale.
I love them.	Kea li rata.
I can get them.	Nka li fumana.
It is their job to do this.	Ke mosebetsi oa bona ho etsa sena.
If you meet then meet.	Haeba le kopane joale le kopane.
It was fun.	Ho ne ho le monate.
Or they would take you.	Kapa ba ne ba tla u nka.
She is beautiful with a baby.	O motle le ngoana.
Have you already found a job?	A na u se u fumane mosebetsi?
We have never had this before.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra ba le sena pele.
Sure, it has to be good.	Ka sebele, e tlameha ho ba e ntle.
We could have been anywhere.	Re ka be re bile kae kapa kae.
But he was not.	Empa o ne a se joalo.
And do it again.	Mme o e etse hape.
And family, of course.	Le lelapa, ehlile.
He is also present.	O teng hape.
He stood by what he said.	A ema le seo a se buileng.
It was definitely a good thing.	Ka sebele e ne e le ntho e ntle.
He did not ask what would make life easier and more enjoyable.	Ha aa ka a botsa hore na ke eng e neng e tla etsa hore bophelo bo be bonolo le bo monate.
Any man can see that.	Monna mang kapa mang a ka bona seo.
This is a matter of living.	Ena ke taba ea ho phela.
This was his last chance and the only one.	Ona e ne e le monyetla oa hae oa ho qetela le o le mong feela.
However, I do not know how to do this.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe mokhoa oa ho etsa sena.
My stomach went back to normal.	Mpa ea ka e ile ea khutlela sebakeng.
We know that now.	Re tseba seo ha jwale.
Life is more difficult.	Bophelo bo thata ho feta.
My mother continued to work.	’Mè o ile a tsoela pele ho sebetsa.
Things you need to know, and then you know them well.	Lintho tseo u lokelang ho li tseba, 'me joale u li tseba hantle.
We want to know what you think.	Re batla ho tseba seo o se nahanang.
We do not know exactly who he is.	Ha re tsebe hantle hore na ke mang oa hae.
Don't talk unless it's your turn.	O se ke wa bua ntle le haeba e le nako ya hao.
And he told them the thought.	Mme a ba bolella mohopolo.
I think soon.	Ke nahana hore haufinyane.
I have to get in there.	Ke tlameha ho kena moo.
Not everyone does that.	Hase bohle ba etsang joalo.
Everyone said they had not seen the questions.	E mong le e mong o itse ha a so bone lipotso.
Very easy to do.	Ho bonolo haholo ho etsa.
We'll see you tomorrow morning.	Re tla u bona hosane hoseng.
The same is true with news.	Ho joalo le ka litaba.
But this, too, in my opinion is a good thing.	Empa sena, le sona, ka maikutlo a ka ke ntho e ntle.
Which way do they go?	Ba tsamaea ka tsela efe?
Thank you for your feedback.	Kea leboha ka maikutlo a hau.
There are other things.	Ho na le lintho tse ling.
They did not even look at him.	Ha ba ka ba mo sheba le ho mo sheba.
It was his favorite way to travel.	E ne e le mokhoa oo a neng a o rata haholo oa ho tsamaea.
You will have to go somewhere.	U tla tlameha ho ea sebakeng se seng.
There are many.	Ho na le tse ngata.
Now it was only a matter of time.	Joale e ne e se e le taba ea nako feela.
He is more than that.	O ho feta.
In fact, he never did.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo.
They do things.	Ba etsa lintho.
But he survived.	Empa o ile a phela.
Or something else.	Kapa ntho e 'ngoe hape.
But you must get them.	Empa u tlameha ho li fumana.
I think that's where he lived.	Ke nahana hore ke moo a neng a lula teng.
I really like this.	Ke rata sena haholo.
He often felt the same way about her.	Hangata o ne a ikutloa joalo ka eena.
But, this is not so bad.	Empa, sena ha se mpe hakaalo.
Well, leave it all to me.	Hantle, tlohela tsohle ho 'na.
We were very close.	Re ne re le haufi haholo.
And they seem to be doing just that.	'Me ho bonahala eka ba tla etsa joalo.
Thinking, loving, living was good.	Ho nahana, ho rata, ho phela ho ne ho le molemo.
I am not.	ha ke joalo.
This is not an idea.	Sena ha se maikutlo.
We no longer meet him.	Ha re sa kopana le eena.
I never thought anyone would do that.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore motho o tla etsa joalo.
Stop, what? 	Ema, eng?
Their production works very well.	Tlhahiso ea tsona e sebetsa hantle haholo.
I must be very late.	E tlameha ebe ke letsa morao haholo.
We save a lot.	Re boloka haholo.
Or my sleep.	Kapa robala ha ka.
I see what they did there.	Ke bona seo ba se entseng moo.
He was doing his job.	O ne a etsa mosebetsi oa hae.
It's your job.	Ke mosebetsi oa hau.
They could no longer exist.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba hlola ba e-ba teng.
it is a force.	ke matla.
It still is.	Ho ntse ho le joalo.
Because he gets it.	Hobane oa e fumana.
This is not your business.	Sena ha se taba ea hau.
Things are fine now.	Lintho li hantle hona joale.
Please take only what you need.	Ke kopa o nke feela seo o se hlokang.
It was their place.	E ne e le sebaka sa bona.
It was really pretty.	E ne e hlile e le ntle haholo.
I mean the dog is the only one.	Ke bolela hore ntja ke eona feela.
It's so fun to be that way.	Ho monate haholo ho ba joalo.
It works and it will work in the future.	E sebetsa 'me e tla sebetsa nakong e tlang.
There is no other way.	Ha ho na mokhoa o mong.
It means we should help people.	Ho bolela hore re lokela ho thusa batho.
Thanks for watching.	Kea leboha ka ho sheba.
It does not matter.	Ha e bohlokoa.
He had heard of such things.	O ne a utloile ka lintho tse joalo.
We can do whatever we want, and so do everyone else.	Re khona ho etsa eng kapa eng eo re e batlang, 'me ho joalo le ka ba bang kaofela.
If ever someone could catch him.	Haeba le neng motho a ka mo tšoara.
With such a good idea, we can do this wonderful work.	Ka mohopolo o motle hakana, re ka etsa mosebetsi ona o motle.
Some dropped out of school.	Ba bang ba ile ba tlohela sekolo.
But that is not the law.	Empa oo hase molao.
This he has never done.	Sena ha a eso se etse.
You have to expect it.	U tlameha ho e lebella.
There is a good chance that you will find it.	Ho na le monyetla o moholo oa hore u tla e fumana.
You are not sure.	Ha o na bonnete.
Therefore, we cannot consider this issue at this time.	Ka hona, re ke ke ra nahana ka taba ena nakong ena.
They have been doing this for years.	E se e le lilemo ba etsa joalo.
He was too big.	O ne a le moholo haholo.
I got a job.	Ke fumane mosebetsi.
Because they know it to be true.	Hobane baa tseba hore ke ’nete.
Then he and I will talk about everything.	Joale 'na le eena re tla bua ka ntho e' ngoe le e 'ngoe.
No, he did not.	Che, o ne a e-s'o ka a etsa joalo.
If they can help us, they can help us.	Haeba ba ka re thusa, ba ka re thusa.
Get another job.	Fumana mosebetsi o mong.
They made us.	Ba re entse.
I think about my room.	Ke nahana ka kamore ea ka.
I did the same.	Le ’na ke ile ka etsa joalo.
I just tried it now.	Ke sa tsoa leka hona joale.
Yes, he heard her now, trying.	E, o ile a mo utloa joale, a leka.
Just look, and you will find.	Sheba feela, 'me u tla fumana.
He knows he will come later.	O a tseba hore o tla fihla morao.
Drive carefully!	Khanna ka hloko!
Then, finally, something could happen.	Joale, qetellong, ho ka etsahala ntho e itseng.
I don't know how you do it.	Ha ke tsebe hore na u e etsa joang.
We do not need help.	Ha re hloke thuso.
I had one time.	Ke bile le nako e le 'ngoe.
I'd like to hear your opinion.	Ke kopa ho utloa maikutlo a hau.
It did last night.	E entse maobane bosiu.
Maybe you will get a job.	Mohlomong o tla fumana mosebetsi.
They said it wouldn't happen.	Ba itse e ke ke ya etsahala.
I don't know how he does it.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o e etsa joang.
This would not have helped us.	Sena se ka be se sa re thusa.
You're saying you don't need any help.	U ntse u re ha u hloke thuso ea letho.
I wanted to say it.	Ke ne ke batla ho e bua.
Then he played alone at night.	Joale o ne a bapala bosiu a le mong.
He came to my house after dinner.	O ile a tla ha ka ka mor'a lijo tsa mantsiboea.
He came out with us once.	O ile a tsoa le rona hang.
I think everyone knows that.	Ke nahana hore bohle ba tseba seo.
Get to work now.	Kena mosebetsing hona joale.
But it would be dangerous, too.	Empa ho ne ho tla ba kotsi, hape.
They came out.	Ba ile ba tsoa.
He was very nice to me.	O ne a le ntle haholo ho nna.
I see it all.	Ke bona tsohle.
They did not give.	Ha baa ka ba fana.
Mine can stand.	Ea ka e ka ema.
It's behind us.	E ka mora rona.
This is very important.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo.
One girl was crying.	Ngoanana e mong o ne a lla.
It is very dangerous but fun with it.	E kotsi haholo empa o monate ka eona.
People start talking, you know.	Batho ba qala ho bua, ua tseba.
They are here for you.	Ba mona bakeng sa hau.
I need a lot of money.	Ke hloka chelete e ngata.
You know, of course.	O a tseba, ehlile.
I know what he thinks.	Ke tseba seo a se nahanang.
There was no such person.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong ea joalo.
He said nothing.	O ne a sa bua letho.
Often, that is the way they do it.	Hangata, ke tsela eo ba e etsang ka eona.
It was beyond him.	E ne e mo feta.
But we must assume that they did.	Empa re tlameha ho nahana hore ba entse joalo.
It does not matter.	Ha ho na taba.
And like you, he loved my family.	'Me joaloka uena, o ne a rata lelapa la ka.
He was useless.	O ne a se na thuso.
He doesn't look kind.	Ha a bonahale a le mofuta.
People drink their coffee.	Batho ba noa kofi ea bona.
I will treat you well.	Ke tla u tšoara hantle.
That's when you want to talk.	Ke teng ha u batla ho bua.
I never felt that way again.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke ikutloa ka tsela eo.
You can see it as clear as anything.	U ka e bona e hlakile joalo ka eng kapa eng.
I told you you would learn something.	Ke o boleletse hore o tla ithuta ho hong.
They are still outside.	Ba ntse ba le ka ntle.
So, it helps.	Kahoo, hoa thusa.
He agreed to come and play.	O ile a lumela ho tla bapala.
I want nothing but home.	Ha ke batle letho ka ntle ho ntlo.
It's still beautiful.	E ntse e le ntle.
She thought of sleeping.	A nahana ho robala.
No one spoke much.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a bua haholo.
I've seen it here before, just not right there.	Ke e bone mona pele, feela e seng hantle moo.
You wonder what could make a person do that.	Ua ipotsa hore na ke eng e ka etsang hore motho a etse joalo.
She stood in her room with her boyfriend.	O ile a ema kamoreng ea hae le mohlankana oa hae.
She was probably just a woman.	Mohlomong e ne e le mosali feela.
Keep in expectation of it.	E lule u e lebeletse.
The more you do it, the easier it becomes.	Ha u ntse u e etsa haholoanyane, ho ba bonolo haholoanyane.
I played it with my head.	Ke ile ka e bapala ka hlooho ea ka.
The truth will come out.	'Nete e tla bonahala.
I'm not exactly sure.	Ha ke na bonnete hantle.
And obviously not.	'Me ho hlakile hore ha ho joalo.
Now is every day.	Hona joale ke letsatsi le leng le le leng.
I had no such time.	Ke ne ke sena nako e joalo.
Then several times again.	Ebe ka makhetlo a 'maloa hape.
They would have to leave somewhere.	Ba ne ba tla tlameha ho tsoa sebakeng se seng.
Your father wanted you to have this.	Ntate oa hao o ne a batla hore u be le sena.
And it can't be.	Mme e ke ke ya ba jwalo.
Or, of course, a question.	Kapa ha e le hantle, potso.
I still could not see him.	Ke ne ke ntse ke sa mo bone.
Nice to have you here with me!	Ke thabela ho ba le uena mona le nna!
You can't take care of him.	U ke ke ua mo hlokomela.
That was not a problem.	Seo ha sea ka sa e-ba bothata.
Nor is it the last.	Hape ha se ea ho qetela.
This is not a new decision.	Sena ha se qeto e ncha.
We enjoyed it.	Re ne re e thabetse.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
He did not even know what time it was.	O ne a sa tsebe le hore na ke nako mang.
But tonight, you're not at work anymore.	Empa bosiung bona, ha o sa le mosebetsing.
If he gets hurt they won't be.	Haeba a ka tsoa kotsi ba ke ke ba.
The first was simple.	Ea pele e ne e le bonolo.
That, that's your present condition.	Hoo, ke boemo ba hao ba jwale.
No, and that would not work.	Che, le seo se ne se ke ke sa sebetsa.
From there if you want.	Ho tloha sebakeng seo haeba u batla.
He may even be able to live with another.	A ka ba a khona ho phela le e mong.
We read about them.	Re bala ka tsona.
They did, probably more often.	Ba ile ba etsa joalo, mohlomong hangata.
He is still alive and well.	O ntse o phela le tsohle.
But they can't.	Empa ha ba khone.
They want to look good in the workplace.	Ba batla ho shebahala hantle mosebetsing.
Finally, they agreed.	Qetellong, ba ile ba lumela.
It did nothing.	Ha ea ka ea etsa letho.
This is not surprising.	Sena ha se ntho e makatsang.
There is nothing wrong now.	Ha ho phoso hona joale.
Of course we would like to help '.	Ehlile re ka rata ho thusa'.
I thought of new money.	Ke ile ka nahana ka chelete e ncha.
Or because nothing happens.	Kapa hobane ha ho letho le etsahalang.
We will just have to work hard.	Re tla tlameha feela ho sebetsa ka thata.
But he knew he had gotten the idea.	Empa o ne a tseba hore o fumane maikutlo.
Or better, for that matter.	Kapa ho molemo, bakeng sa taba eo.
He loved them, but now he had no shoes before that.	O ne a ba rata, empa joale o ne a se na lieta pele ho tseo.
But only one.	Empa e le 'ngoe feela.
I have never seen this.	Ha ke eso bone sena.
I don't even want to do it.	Ha ke batle le ho e etsa.
I knew they would never do the same thing again and again.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ba ke ke ba etsa ntho e tšoanang nako le nako.
Anything you can say and do.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe eo u ka e buang le ho bua ka eona.
Very, very powerful.	Haholo, e matla haholo.
Thank you, it was fun for you.	Kea leboha, ho bile monate ho uena.
Fast and easy !.	Kapele le bonolo!.
The road certainly went on.	Ka sebele tsela e ile ea tsoela pele.
Well, it's here.	Be, e teng mona.
But we will find him.	Empa re tla mo fumana.
We did a little bit.	Re entse joalo hanyane.
So, start by fixing it.	Kahoo, qala ka ho e lokisa.
He dreamed of becoming a doctor.	O ne a lakatsa ho ba ngaka.
If not, he may not come in the morning.	Haeba ho se joalo, a ka ’na a se ke a fihla hoseng.
He knew nothing.	O ne a sa tsebe letho.
They would not, of course.	Ba ne ba ke ke, ehlile.
But now it's gone.	Empa jwale e ile.
Nothing he ever worked on.	Ha ho letho leo a kileng a le sebetsa.
I know why.	Ke tseba lebaka.
She wondered if she was feeling the same way.	O ne a ipotsa hore na le eena o ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
But we need to know.	Empa re lokela ho tseba.
They are doing just that.	Ba ntse ba etsa joalo.
Because only one person has to do that work.	Hobane ke motho a le mong feela ea lokelang ho etsa mosebetsi oo.
Maybe we can fix something.	Mohlomong re ka lokisa ho hong.
I hope you will find my job as you like.	Ke tšepa hore u tla fumana mosebetsi oa ka kamoo u ratang kateng.
Some people believe that we should deny ourselves that we need help.	Batho ba bang ba lumela hore re lokela ho hana hore re hloka thuso.
However, this felt important.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se ne se ikutloa se le bohlokoa.
And of course there are more to come.	'Me ehlile ho na le tse ling tse tlang.
This is us.	Ke rona bana.
It has to do this or it does nothing.	E tlameha ho etsa sena kapa ha e etse letho.
We are playing very well.	Re ntse re bapala hantle haholo.
He knew we were there.	O ne a tseba hore re teng.
You want to try it.	O ya batla ho e leka.
I wonder why you didn't do that.	Kea ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha u sa ka ua etsa joalo.
Writing is hard work.	Ho ngola ke mosebetsi o boima.
I think.	Ke nahana.
There is plenty of time!	Ho na le nako e ngata!
But it will not start.	Empa e ke ke ea qala.
He obviously does.	Ho hlakile hore o teng.
The boy is afraid of danger.	Moshanyana o tšaba kotsi.
In an empty space.	Sebakeng se se nang letho.
He could get it all now.	O ne a ka fumana tsohle jwale.
I would not give up.	Ke ne nke ke ka e tlohela.
That's what we are in the end.	Ke seo re leng sona qetellong.
I'm just trying to make you understand the situation.	Ke mpa ke leka ho etsa hore u utloisise boemo.
We will buy books.	Re tla reka libuka.
But it is no longer there.	Empa ha e sa le eo.
However, a few more questions.	Leha ho le joalo, lipotso tse ling tse seng kae.
There was nothing that it was as it was.	Ho ne ho se letho le neng le le kamoo le neng le le kateng.
I could not live without him.	Ke ne nke ke ka phela ntle le eena.
He ate too much.	O ne a ja lijo tse ngata haholo.
He wanted to do his job.	O ne a batla ho etsa mosebetsi oa hae.
If so to you.	Haeba ho joalo ho uena.
It is close and very nice.	E haufi mme e ntle haholo.
For some reason.	Ka lebaka le itseng.
But it doesn't have to be that way.	Empa ha ho a tlameha ho ba ka tsela eo.
This is just play money.	Ena ke chelete ea ho bapala feela.
It was just a question.	E ne e le potso feela.
I did not think this well.	Ha kea ka ka nahana sena hantle.
There is no money to do the things we did.	Ha ho na chelete ea ho etsa lintho tseo re li entseng.
But do not overeat!	Empa u se ke ua ja haholo!
No, more than news.	Che, ho feta litaba.
Like it or not, it is a fact of life.	O rata kapa che, ke 'nete ea bophelo.
When they slept, it was as if nothing had happened.	Ha ba robala, e ne eka ha ho letho le etsahetseng.
That year we got into it.	Selemong seo re ile ra kena ho sona.
You hope you never have to use it.	U tšepa hore ha ho mohla u tla tlameha ho e sebelisa.
While that may be true, it may not be the best.	Le hoja hoo e ka ’na eaba ke ’nete, ho ka ’na ha se ke ha e-ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
We can't do it here.	Re ke ke ra e etsa mona.
I could not stay in it.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho lula ho eona.
However, you will be giving someone a very good job.	Leha ho le joalo, u tla be u fa motho mosebetsi o motle haholo.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke na bonnete.
It was better, much better.	E ne e le betere, e betere haholo.
You look beautiful.	O shebahala o le motle.
I'm tired of that.	Ke khathetse ke seo.
All you have to do is find them at this time.	Seo u lokelang ho se etsa ke ho li fumana nakong ena.
Unfortunately it is not good news for you.	Ke masoabi ha se litaba tse molemo ho uena.
He may not even be there.	A ka ba a le sieo.
Try to do that.	Leka ho etsa joalo.
He will have his work for him.	O tla ba le mosebetsi oa hae bakeng sa hae.
Then another man passed by.	Eaba monna e mong oa feta.
It has power, but.	E na le matla, empa.
Everyone had to take that thing.	E mong le e mong o ne a tlameha hore ebe o ne a nka ntho eo.
So, it makes it harder.	Ka hona, ho etsa hore ho be thata.
However, we think so.	Leha ho le joalo, re nahana hore ho joalo.
You ask everything you do, and everything you say.	U botsa tsohle tseo u li etsang, le tsohle tseo u li buang.
It makes it easy.	E etsa hore ho be bonolo.
We no longer eat of it.	Ha re sa ja tsa eona.
His wife wants to live.	Mosali oa hae o batla ho phela.
That was the law.	Seo e ne e le molao.
The children are happy to see you.	Bana ba thabela ho o bona.
It's very simple.	E bonolo haholo.
My father was one of them, see.	Ntate e ne e le e mong wa bona, le a bona.
It is important or we would not take our time or yours.	Ho bohlokoa kapa re ka be re sa nke nako ea rona kapa ea hau.
Of course he does not know.	Ehlile ha a tsebe.
It's just asking for problems.	Ke ho kopa mathata feela.
Then we need to start again.	Ebe le rona re lokela ho qala hape.
And it was not necessary.	'Me ho ne ho sa hlokahale.
He finds them often.	O li fumana hangata.
And now, it's time to move on.	'Me joale, ke nako ea hore re tsamaee.
They should have found this.	Ba ne ba lokela ho fumana sena.
This would do.	Sena se ne se tla etsa.
May I take a look at it?	Ke kopa ho e bona.
But we could.	Empa re ne re ka khona.
The boy is here.	Moshanyana o teng mona.
I will try that first.	Ke tla leka seo pele.
I need to sleep.	Ke lokela ho robala.
And what else do you think? 	Mme nahana eng hape?
But in name only.	Empa ka lebitso feela.
But you have to go beyond that.	Empa u tlameha ho feta ho eona.
I knew why.	Ke ne ke tseba hore na bakeng sa eng.
He did not expect it to last that long.	O ne a sa lebella hore ho tla nka nako e telele hakaalo.
He prepares food.	A lokisa lijo.
They wanted to win.	Ba ne ba batla ho hlola.
Unless you have to.	Ntle le hore ha ua tlameha ho etsa.
It works for me.	E ea sebetsa bakeng sa ka.
You can start now.	U ka qala hona joale.
I did not get that.	Ha kea ka ka fumana seo.
He looked at another man.	A sheba monna e mong.
It works just like you used it before.	E sebetsa joalo ka ha u e sebelisa pele.
To me, that is something special.	Ho 'na, hoo ho bohlokoa ho hong.
Maybe that's all.	Mohlomong ke tsena tsohle.
They need food and water.	Ba hloka lijo le metsi.
I hope you will be back soon !.	Ke tšepa hore u tla khutla hangata!.
In the end, they all worked well together.	Qetellong, bohle ba ne ba sebetsa hammoho hantle haholo.
You told us what to do.	U re boleletse seo re lokelang ho se etsa.
But then the problem comes with this group.	Empa joale bothata bo tla ka sehlopha sena.
They want to take care of him.	Ba batla ho mo hlokomela.
We have anything.	Re na le eng kapa eng.
This is really very simple.	Sena se hlile se bonolo haholo.
You know where he is at.	Le tseba moo a leng teng.
Tom decided not to tell his parents the truth.	Tom o ile a etsa qeto ea ho se bolelle batsoali ba hae ’nete.
He found it difficult to get a job.	O ile a fumana ho le thata ho fumana mosebetsi.
No, there is nothing like it.	Che, ha ho letho le tšoanang le eona.
Maybe he didn't care to be alone with her.	Mohlomong o ne a sa tsotelle ho ba mong le eena.
You could stay overnight in the bedroom.	U ne u ka lula bosiu ka kamoreng ea ho robala.
There is no breakfast now.	Ha ho na lijo tsa hoseng joale.
They did it.	Ba e entse.
Live, baby, live.	Phela, ngoana, phela.
He could have seen them again.	A ka be a ba bone hape.
I ask the man.	Ke botsa monna.
We will never be.	Ha ho mohla re tla ba teng.
They loved each and every one of us very much.	Ba ne ba rata e mong le e mong oa rona haholo.
Well, that's it.	Be, ke eona.
Sadly, that must be the case.	Ho bohloko hore ebe e tlameha ebe ho joalo.
That was their life.	E ne e le bophelo ba bona boo.
He did not know what it was.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke eng.
And now we have a lot to do.	'Me joale re na le lintho tse ngata tseo re lokelang ho li etsa.
To do something with nothing.	Ho etsa ntho ka letho.
His family, for one.	Lelapa la hae, bakeng sa le leng.
We'll see how things go.	Re tla bona hore na lintho li tsamaea joang.
I will admit that it is not very easy to understand.	Ke tla lumela hore ha ho bonolo haholo ho utloisisa.
That is what happened.	Ke sona se ileng sa etsahala.
Some similar.	Tse ling tse tšoanang.
But other things too.	Empa lintho tse ling hape.
Now I know what he thinks.	Joale kea tseba hore na o nahana eng.
And he will.	Mme o tla etsa jwalo.
I could just stay here.	Nka mpa ka lula mona.
We have help.	Re na le thuso.
She cried, realizing she was alone.	O ile a lla, a hlokomela hore o ne a le mong.
He knew what he was going to get.	O ne a tseba seo a tla se fumana.
So here is my question.	Kahoo potso ea ka ke ena.
They can say yes or no.	Ba ka re e kapa che.
Money was hard.	Chelete e ne e le thata.
People realize that.	Batho ba hlokomela seo.
He thought again quickly.	O ile a nahana hape kapele.
You know, such important things.	Ua tseba, lintho tsa bohlokoa joalo.
For that, and for the man.	Bakeng sa seo, le bakeng sa monna.
There is no room for error.	Haho sebaka sa phoso.
I'm guilty	Ke molato
I decided that we should go back.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea hore re lokela ho khutlela morao.
You are not sure.	Ha o tsebe hantle.
There was a time he had.	Ho ne ho e-na le nako eo a neng a e-na le eona.
He had to do it without using his hands or feet.	O ne a tlameha ho li etsa ntle le ho sebelisa matsoho kapa maoto.
That's a lot of things.	Ke lintho tse ngata.
It did, hard.	E entse, ka thata.
He expressed his feelings.	A bua maikutlo a hae.
Family and friends can apply together.	Ba lelapa le metsoalle ba ka etsa kopo hammoho.
Then go out.	Joale tsoa.
What to do with them.	Seo u lokelang ho se etsa ka bona.
The two of them worked together as a team.	Bobeli ba bona ba ne ba sebetsa hammoho e le sehlopha.
It was not a family.	E ne e se lelapa.
It was his team now.	E ne e le sehlopha sa hae jwale.
But he is not.	Empa ha a joalo.
That means something.	Hoo ho bolela ho hong.
I thought you knew.	Ke ne ke nahana hore oa tseba.
They come home, time.	Ba tla hae, nako.
So he had done something.	Kahoo o ne a entse ho hong.
And his dog.	Le ntja ea hae.
Che.	Che.
Go this way.	Tsamaea ka tsela ena.
Who would have thought that, all that money and everything.	Ke mang ea ka nahanang joalo, chelete eo eohle le ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
It also no longer works.	Le eona ha e sa sebetsa.
I don't have to be this way.	Ha ke a tlameha ho ba ka tsela ena.
I knew that.	Ke ne ke tseba seo.
Meet him.	Kopana le eena.
I knew it was possible at the time.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ke ntho e ka etsahalang ka nako eo.
You have to keep writing.	U lokela ho tsoela pele ho ngola.
Keep talking.	Dula o bue.
Something told him not to open the door.	Ho na le ntho e ileng ea mo bolella hore a se ke a bula lemati.
Who is there? 	Ke mang moo?
When you have finished drinking it again.	Ha u qeta ho e noa hape.
I think you should do that a little bit.	Ke nahana hore o lokela ho etsa seo hanyane.
I just know we will be together.	Ke tseba feela hore re tla ba hammoho.
I did not understand that at the time.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise seo ka nako eo.
They are there.	Ba teng.
But he was not alone.	Mme o ne a se mong.
I was a schoolteacher.	Ke ne ke le tichere ea sekolo.
And a week before that.	Mme beke pele ho moo.
I can decide to use my time.	Ke khona ho etsa qeto ea ho sebelisa nako ea ka.
Then I went to bed.	Eaba ke ea robala.
My time!	Nako ea ka!
And why did they not ask?	Hona ke hobane'ng ha ba sa ka ba botsa?
If he could catch them, it would be much easier.	Haeba a ne a ka li tšoara, ho ne ho tla ba bonolo haholoanyane.
You understand it.	Ua e utloisisa.
Do not sit down.	U se ke ua lula fatše.
There was a man and a woman there.	Ho ne ho e-na le monna le mosali ba le teng.
I am of no use.	Ha ke na thuso ea letho.
You just want to be alone.	U batla ho ba uena feela.
The food is delicious.	Lijo li monate.
You have a problem.	O na le bothata.
It was the way of time.	E ne e le tsela ea nako.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
I don't know what happened to him.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ho ile ha etsahala’ng ka eena.
One week.	Beke e le 'ngoe.
I'm glad you found this useful.	Ke thabela hore ebe u fumane sena se le molemo.
They always have something to do!	Kamehla ba na le seo o ka se etsang!
And that won't work.	Mme hoo ho ke ke ha sebetsa.
I have to be good at something like this.	Ke tlameha ho ba hantle ka ntho ea mofuta ona.
My children love it.	Bana ba ka ba e rata.
We enjoyed them.	Re ile ra li thabela.
Money, for one thing.	Chelete, bakeng sa ntho e le 'ngoe.
She wondered if she would let him stay there.	O ne a ipotsa hore na o tla mo lumella ho lula moo.
I just can't have children.	Nka mpa ka se be le bana.
But that is a real danger.	Empa hoo ke kotsi ea sebele.
He enters.	O kena.
It was not long before he arrived home with the good news.	Ha hoa ka ha feta nako e telele pele a fihla hae ka litaba tse molemo.
One has to speak.	Motho o lokela ho bua.
He got that from you.	O fumane seo ho wena.
We want to know more about it.	Re batla ho tseba haholoanyane ka eona.
This is really clear!	Sena se hlile se hlakile!
The children loved her.	Bana ba ne ba mo rata.
They consider it very important.	Ba e nka e le ea bohlokoa haholo.
He can't buy it.	A ke ke a e reka.
It wasn't good, but it wasn't bad.	E ne e se ntle, empa e ne e se mpe.
He has friends.	O na le metsoalle.
He knows he can do it.	O a tseba a ka e etsa.
You know, that girl is so cute.	Ua tseba, ngoanana eo o motle haholo.
This is my life right now.	Bona ke bophelo ba ka hona joale.
My mother was no better.	'M'e oa ka o ne a se betere.
There was no problem of any kind.	Ho ne ho se na bothata ba mofuta ofe.
Only, it could have been one that he did.	Feela, e ka be e bile e 'ngoe eo e e entseng.
Still, it was good for them.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le molemo ho bona.
But somehow it hurts, too.	Empa ka tsela e itseng ho bohloko, hape.
He would do that in the future.	O ne a tla etsa joalo nakong e tlang.
Think of this book.	Nahana ka buka ena.
I was just trying to forget.	Ke ne ke leka ho lebala feela.
That is what we will do.	Ke seo re tla se etsa.
If so, she had not said anything, but then she would have said nothing.	Haeba ho joalo, o ne a e-so ka a bua letho, empa joale o ne a tla be a sa bua.
I ended up doing that.	Ke qetile ho etsa seo.
There is no other.	Haho e mong.
This is something you should never do.	Sena ke ntho eo u sa lokelang ho e etsa le ka mohla.
When they heard what had happened, many of them left.	Ha ba utloa hore na ke eng, ba bangata ba ile ba tsamaea.
I think it's time.	Ke nahana hore ke nako.
No one should doubt that.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho belaela ka seo.
I really need both.	Ka sebele ke li hloka ka bobeli.
Your news.	Litaba tsa hau.
They're going to talk about it.	Ba tl’o bua ka eona.
They could have gone home sooner.	Ba ka be ba ile hae kapele.
This is what life was all about.	Sena ke seo bophelo bo neng bo le sona.
Good writing style.	Mokhoa o motle oa ho ngola.
What was it for our girl this past year.	E ne e le eng bakeng sa ngoanana oa rona selemong sena se fetileng.
You're another pretty girl.	U ngoanana e mong e motle haholo.
It is up to you to decide.	Ho ho uena ho etsa qeto.
He stood up.	A ema ka maoto.
He just needed to see them.	O ne a hloka feela ho bona.
It is also a great place to drink.	Hape ke sebaka se setle sa ho noa.
But he wanted to talk about it.	Empa o ne a batla ho bua ka eona.
He could hear nothing.	O ne a sa utloa letho.
Then it was up to him.	Joale e ne e le ho eena.
I want to be here now.	Ke batla ho ba mona le hona joale.
His was a tragic accident.	Ya hae e bile kotsi e bohloko.
My father will not love him.	Ntate a ke ke a mo rata.
I think of the day.	Ke nahana ka letsatsi.
Anything like this usually happens when they are close.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e kang ena hangata e etsahala ha ba le haufi.
They are very good.	Li ntle haholo.
They want to do things.	Ba batla ho etsa lintho.
No one is better than you.	Ha ho motho ea ka bang betere ho u feta.
Of course I can't do that right now.	Ha e le hantle ha ke khone ho etsa joalo hona joale.
Do not write that.	O seke wa ngola seo.
Her eldest son was arrested.	Mora oa hae e moholo o ile a tšoaroa.
This is what we have been waiting for.	Sena ke seo esale re se emetse.
They don't like you.	Ha ba u rate.
You have to make it your priority.	U tlameha ho e etsa hore e be eona ntho e tlang pele.
I have to go through it.	Ke tlameha ho feta ho eona.
But he did not care.	Empa o ne a sa tsotelle.
Think it over very carefully.	E nahane ka hloko haholo.
Since then, he has been looking for a job.	Ho tloha ka nako eo, esale a batla mosebetsi.
Shopping with Mom.	Ho reka le 'Mè.
They can't stay.	Ba ke ke ba dula.
Many of them were present for four years.	Ba bangata ba bona ba ne ba le teng ka lilemo tse 'ne.
I did it.	Ke ile ka e etsa.
Thinking about having children can be even more difficult.	Ho nahana ka ho ba le bana ho ka ba thata le ho feta.
But no one is there.	Empa haho motho moo.
I am a boy.	Ke moshanyana.
I still can.	Ke ntse ke khona.
So they had to reunite.	Kahoo ba ile ba tlameha ho kopana hape.
Thank you to all who will consider giving.	Ke leboha bohle ba tla nahana ho fana.
Hard time.	Nako e boima.
Well, here it is.	Be, ke ena.
Back to work.	Khutlela mosebetsing.
He loved to read.	O ne a rata ho bala.
It sang anytime from morning till night.	E ne e bina neng kapa neng ho tloha hoseng ho fihlela bosiu.
Moreover, there will be other problems.	Ho feta moo, ho tla ba le mathata a mang.
It's a long way.	Ke tsela e telele.
You probably shouldn’t talk about it, to be honest.	Mohlomong ha ua lokela ho bua ka eona, ho bua 'nete.
I was not mistaken.	Ke ne ke sa etsa phoso.
That is the only real issue here.	Ke eona feela taba ea sebele mona.
It was during this time that he was arrested.	Ke nakong ena moo a ileng a tšoaroa.
Whatever he was doing was that way.	Eng kapa eng eo a neng a e etsa e ne e le ka tsela eo.
It was ahead of what everyone else was doing.	E ne e le ka pele ho seo bohle ba neng ba se etsa.
I say why not.	Ke re hobaneng ho se joalo.
He still seems to reach those times.	O ntse a bonahala a fihlela nako tseo.
I have a life.	Ke na le bophelo.
No one needs to know.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho tseba.
And that's us.	Mme ke rona.
Some people use it.	Batho ba bang ba e sebelisa.
However, it is not too long to wait now.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho nako e telele ho ema hona joale.
Thank you.	Kea leboha.
This has been very helpful.	Sena se bile molemo haholo.
Then he picked up the phone.	Eaba o nka mohala.
Of course, he knew exactly where the problem was.	Ehlile, o ne a tseba hantle hore na bothata bo hokae.
I really need to watch it.	Ke hlile ke hloka ho e shebella.
It may take some time.	Ho ka nka nako.
He wondered what to do.	A ipotsa hore na a etse eng.
You can do the same thing here.	U ka etsa ntho e tšoanang mona.
I'm not sure anywhere.	Ha ke na bonnete ba kae kapa kae.
You are not sure how to fix this.	Ha u na bonnete ba hore na u ka lokisa sena joang.
Soon they will be there to help.	Haufinyane ba tla ba teng ho thusa.
He must have found it.	E tlameha ebe o ile a e fumana.
That is what he wants us to do.	Ke seo a batlang hore re se etse.
They heard something.	Ba utloile ho hong.
That is what happened.	Ke sona se etsahetseng.
This will take several hours.	Sena se tla nka lihora tse 'maloa.
It helps to think before you speak.	Hoa thusa ho nahana pele u bua.
We no longer wanted to play.	Re ne re se re sa batle ho bapala.
He opened the front door and entered.	A bula lemati le ka pele mme a kena.
He will come as one.	O tla tla joalo ka e mong.
That, and that, and that too.	Hoo, le hoo, le hoo hape.
When they arrived, she was reading a book.	Ha ba fihla, o ne a ntse a bala buka.
So we have.	Ka hona re na le.
Or he could have done something else.	Kapa o ne a ka etsa ho hong.
But many are not.	Empa ba bangata ha ba joalo.
I don't think life works that way.	Ha ke nahane hore bophelo bo sebetsa jwalo.
He says he met her.	O re o ile oa kopana le eena.
He did not expect it to be so easy.	O ne a sa lebella hore ho ka ba bonolo hakana.
He was hard to read.	O ne a le thata ho bala.
That's my whole story.	Ke eona taba ea ka kaofela.
It was the best of times.	E ne e le linako tse molemo ka ho fetisisa.
It was one of my faults.	E ne e le phoso e 'ngoe ea ka.
I go into his room.	Ke kena ka kamoreng ea hae.
He stays behind.	O dula a le morao.
I really didn't know anything about it.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa tsebe letho ka hona.
We have to have something with the idea of ​​a car.	Re tlameha ho ba le ntho e nang le maikutlo a koloi.
This is the last one.	Ena ke ea ho qetela.
What your item is.	Hore na ntho ea hau ke efe.
Now here's the thing.	Joale taba ke ena.
I really like this idea.	Ke hlile ke rata mohopolo ona.
They both went to the area.	Ka bobeli ba ile ba ea sebakeng seo.
I know they are there.	Kea tseba ba teng.
They say you are doing well.	Ba re o ntse o sebetsa hantle.
Nothing seemed important.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se letho le bohlokoa.
It was no surprise.	E ne e se ntho e makatsang.
However, it needs it.	Leha ho le joalo, ea e hloka.
Of course.	Ha e le 'nete.
It's not easy, but it can happen.	Ha ho bonolo, empa ho ka etsahala.
For all they had.	Ho tsohle tseo ba neng ba le tsona.
Nobody seemed to be able to think of many things to say.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se motho ea khonang ho nahana lintho tse ngata tseo a ka li buang.
And my new book.	Le buka ea ka e ncha.
He was tired, and yet he could not sleep.	O ne a khathetse, leha ho le joalo o ne a sitoa ho robala.
But there is probably no future.	Empa mohlomong ha ho na nako e tlang.
I am in my second year of high school.	Ke selemong sa bobeli sekolong se phahameng.
His place was supposed to be close by.	Sebaka sa hae se ne se lokela ho ba haufi le moo.
We can still fix this issue.	Re ntse re ka lokisa taba ena.
He had never thought of getting here.	O ne a eso nahane ho fihla mona.
You're not.	Ha u joalo.
He decided it was time to get out of there.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore ke nako ea ho tsoa moo.
But here is my problem.	Empa bothata ba ka ke bona.
Nobody knew where he was going.	Ho ne ho se motho ya neng a tseba moo a ileng teng.
I started to go through one of them.	Ke ile ka qala ho feta ho e 'ngoe ea tsona.
He refused to talk to them.	O ile a hana ho bua le bona.
This was a way of thinking about the past.	Ena e ne e le mokhoa oa ho nahana nakong e fetileng.
What did you do today in your work ?.	O entse eng kajeno mosebetsing oa hau?.
I hope you will understand my question.	Ke tšepa hore u tla utloisisa potso ea ka.
It's not hard, I'm done.	Ha ho thata, ke qetile.
Every now and then.	Nako le nako.
It certainly was.	Ka sebele ho ne ho le joalo.
But he did not like her.	Empa o ne a sa mo rate.
He did just fine.	O entse hantle feela.
There is no better time.	Ha ho nako e monate.
We can do nothing about him here.	Ha re khone ho etsa letho ka eena ka mona.
It was the first time I had seen anything like it.	Ke ne ke qala ho bona ntho e kang ena.
But it was not the last of his problems.	Empa e ne e se bothata ba ho qetela ba mathata a hae.
We make it difficult.	Re etsa hore ho be thata.
Travel is easy.	Ho tsamaea ho bonolo.
Thanks again.	Kea leboha hape.
Is that what you were trying to say?	Na ke sona seo u neng u batla ho se bua?
The team worked well together during this time.	Sehlopha se ile sa sebetsa hammoho hantle nakong ena.
An accident like this cannot happen without human error.	Kotsi e kang ena e ke ke ea etsahala ntle le phoso ea motho.
It will pass.	E tla feta.
These were certainly my favorites.	Ka sebele tsena e ne e le tseo ke li ratang haholo.
We are very good at this.	Re hantle haholo bakeng sa sena.
We need to talk to them.	Re lokela ho bua le bona.
No, he apparently did, but he did not.	Che, ho bonahala eka o entse joalo, empa ha a ka a etsa joalo.
That can always be a possibility.	Seo se ka lula e le ntho e ka etsahalang.
Take all they have.	Nka tsohle tseo ba nang le tsona.
The task was relatively easy.	Mosebetsi o ne o batla o le bonolo.
We can't stay.	Re ke ke ra lula.
They will have to learn how it works a little bit.	Ba tla tlameha ho ithuta hore na e sebetsa joang hanyane.
That suggests you can both agree.	Seo se fana ka maikutlo a hore u ka lumela ka bobeli.
For the whole place.	Bakeng sa sebaka sohle.
I did not know when that would happen.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ho tla etsahala neng kapa joang.
He works hard to provide for his family.	O sebetsa ka thata ho hlokomela lelapa la hae.
I know what's wrong with you.	Kea tseba hore na molato ke eng ka uena.
Then they will return home.	Joale ba tla khutlela hae.
I know you read hard.	Kea tseba hore o bala ka thata.
I think he will not visit there.	Ke nahana hore a ke ke a etela moo.
But many people use it that way.	Empa batho ba bangata ba e sebelisa ka tsela eo.
I came.	Ke ile ka tla.
And many more.	Le tse ngata.
It's a good product.	Ke tlhahiso e ntle.
I have not yet received it.	ha ke so e fumane.
Let's say something happened.	A re re ho na le ntho e etsahetseng.
You are not big enough.	Ha o moholo ho lekana.
It is better that it is a school day.	Ho molemo hore ke letsatsi la sekolo.
And he never did, but.	Mme ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa jwalo, empa.
So they watched.	Kahoo ba shebella.
You do not know how to speak.	Ha o tsebe ho bua.
You can buy as many items as you like.	U ka reka lintho tse ngata kamoo u ratang.
These shoes are bad.	Lieta tsena li mpe.
And yet he did not come.	Mme leha ho le jwalo ha a ka a tla.
Life must go on.	Bophelo bo tlameha ho tsoela pele.
Check out some of our favorites.	Sheba tse ling tseo re li ratang.
If you try to do something, you will do it	Haeba u leka ho etsa ntho e itseng, u tla e etsa
I don't care. 	Ha ke tsotelle. 
ka.	ka.
Now, people save even more.	Joale, batho ba boloka le ho feta.
He told me everything.	O ile a mpolella tsohle.
I wanted to stay, to feel more.	Ke ne ke batla ho lula, ho utloa haholoanyane.
And we loved him.	Mme le rona re ne re mo rata.
They were there, and they were not.	Ba ne ba le teng, ebe ha ba eo.
I will not tell anyone.	Nke ke ka bolella motho.
But he never had it.	Empa ha ho mohla a kileng a ba le eona.
Usually, we take too many things.	Hangata, re nka lintho tse ngata haholo.
However, thank you for your feedback here.	Leha ho le joalo, ke leboha maikutlo a hau mona.
I had a good idea of ​​what this meant.	Ke ile ka ba le mohopolo o motle hore na sena se bolela eng.
Do we really need another restaurant?	A na re hlile re hloka ntlo e 'ngoe ea lijo?
Not even a car ride.	Leha e le ho palama koloi.
Help could come to them quickly.	Thuso e ne e ka fihla ho bona kapele.
It's just useless.	E mpa e se na thuso.
Homework is too much for me.	Mosebetsi oa sekolo o mpheta haholo.
Some may not see it, but we do.	Ba bang ba ka ’na ba se ke ba e bona, empa rōna rea ​​e bona.
These were his.	Tsena e ne e le tsa hae.
You have a good job.	U na le mosebetsi o motle.
But you obviously did not know about me.	Empa ho hlakile hore le ne le sa tsebe ka nna.
It seemed a lot at the time.	E ne e bonahala e le ngata ka nako eo.
It can be anyone.	E ka ba mang kapa mang.
I meant it.	Ke ne ke e bolela.
You take every opportunity.	U nka monyetla o mong le o mong.
He would never do that.	Ho hang o ne a ke ke a etsa joalo.
No one is there alone.	Ha ho motho ea teng a le mong.
It will be your strength from now on.	E tlo ba matla a hao ho tloha jwale.
Back there.	Morao moo.
He called again.	A letsa hape.
It was the only way it always worked.	E ne e le eona feela tsela e neng e sebetsa kamehla.
And we just have to live with that.	Mme re tlameha feela ho phela le seo.
I stopped and looked at it.	Ka ema ka e sheba.
To be better.	Ho ba betere.
You are not my father.	Ha u ntate oa ka.
I had them.	Ke ne ke na le tsona.
We will be able to achieve this.	Re tla khona ho fihlela sena.
Please expect a longer wait.	Ka kopo lebella ho ema nako e telele.
This will definitely make me go.	Sena se hlile se tla etsa hore ke tsamaee.
Something is happening with this thing.	Ho na le ntho e etsahalang ka ntho ena.
However he did not stay anywhere for long.	Leha ho le joalo ha aa ka a lula kae kapa kae nako e telele.
I would leave and come back again.	Ke ne ke tla tsamaea ebe ke khutla hape.
The food was very tasty.	Lijo li ne li le monate haholo.
We love to.	Re rata ho.
She did very well !.	O entse hantle haholo!.
They know nothing else.	Ha ba tsebe letho le leng.
However, we have been happy since his return.	Leha ho le joalo, haesale re thabile ho tloha ha a khutla.
They could say what they liked.	Ba ne ba ka bua seo ba se ratang.
Thank you now.	Kea leboha ha joale.
I'm in pain.	Ke utloa bohloko.
They did not love their lives.	Ha baa ka ba rata bophelo ba bona.
Eat what you want.	Ja seo u se batlang.
Surprisingly, no one did.	Ho makatsang ke hore ha ho motho ea ileng a etsa joalo.
You didn’t know you needed to keep it.	O ne o sa tsebe hore o hloka ho e boloka.
They stopped and watched as we passed them.	Ba ile ba ema ’me ba shebella ha re ba feta.
That may seem like a long time.	Seo se ka bonahala eka ke nako e ngata.
We love our son.	Re rata mora oa rona.
That is why it is so.	Ke ka hona e leng seo e leng sona.
Let's see what happens.	A re bone se etsahalang.
Long standing.	Ho ema ha nako e telele.
It can't pass it.	E ke ke ea e feta.
However, you do not know.	Leha ho le joalo, ha u tsebe.
I love it, it keeps things fresh.	Kea e rata, e boloka lintho li le ncha.
You have met them before.	U kile ua kopana le bona pele.
They do it right there.	Ba e etsa hona moo.
That was where he was before he died.	Ke hona moo a neng a le teng pele a hlokahala.
Otherwise it does not matter.	Ho seng joalo ha ho na taba.
I thought people would see it.	Ke ne ke nahana hore batho ba tla e bona.
The crying continued.	Ho lla ho ile ha tsoela pele.
We can talk about that later.	Re ka bua ka eona ka nako e ’ngoe.
They both have their place.	Bobeli ba na le sebaka sa bona.
Next to each image.	Haufi le setšoantšo ka seng.
He wants it bad.	O e batla e le mpe.
We never believed you needed them.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra lumela hore ua li hloka.
I didn't care.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle letho.
It will be easy to find.	Ho tla ba bonolo ho e fumana.
You know what he is like.	Ua tseba hore na o joang.
You know you can.	Ua tseba hore u ka khona.
I can't find the phone.	Ha ke khone ho fumana mohala.
But all he could think of was her.	Empa sohle seo a neng a ka se nahana ke eena feela.
Spend time with it.	Qeta nako le eona.
And that is what they needed.	Mme ke seo ba neng ba se hloka.
This has taken too long.	Sena se nkile nako e telele haholo.
It is a family law only.	Ke molao oa lelapa feela.
We are back.	Rea khutla.
He could not walk properly.	O ne a sa khone ho tsamaea hantle.
But it is very important.	Empa ho bohlokoa haholo.
Nobody does it.	Haho motho ya e etsang.
Look behind me, right here.	Sheba ka morao ho nna, hantle mona.
There is no one here right now.	Ha ho na motho mona hona joale.
You do the same.	Le uena u etsa joalo.
There is no one.	Haho le ya mong.
He was not very good.	O ne a se motle haholo.
I certainly saw them.	Ka sebele ke ile ka ba bona.
He did not write anything for three days.	Ha aa ka a ngola letho ka matsatsi a mararo.
Don’t make me think any other way.	U se ke ua etsa hore ke nahane ka tsela e 'ngoe.
If there are people nearby call for help.	Haeba ho na le batho ba haufi letsetsa thuso.
The matter is clear now.	Taba eo e hlakile hona joale.
Maybe he would do the same thing.	Mohlomong o ne a tla etsa ntho e tšoanang.
This is our great benefit.	Sena ke molemo oa rona o moholo.
We can help !.	Re ka thusa!.
I will continue reading.	Ke tla tsoela pele ho bala.
Of course, that was not the case.	Ha e le hantle, ho ne ho se joalo.
Is he not doing a good job?	Na ha a etse mosebetsi o motle?
It seemed innocent enough.	E ne e bonahala e se na molato ka ho lekaneng.
Before he knew it was wrong.	Pele a tseba hore ho na le phoso.
He ate breakfast every morning.	O ne a ja lijo tsa hoseng hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
You have already received a letter.	U se u fumane lengolo.
From then on.	Ho tloha ka nako eo ho ea pele.
Thanks for your help.	Ke leboha thuso ea hau.
Maybe you would be happy to see him go.	Mohlomong u ka thabela ho mo bona a ile.
Obviously this is good news.	Ho hlakile hore tsena ke litaba tse monate.
Good local travel.	Ho tsamaea hantle sebakeng.
That will have to do.	Seo se tla lokela ho etsa.
See what your friends think of them.	Bona hore na metsoalle ea hau e nahana eng ka bona.
I spent a lot of time outdoors.	Ke ile ka qeta nako e ngata ke le ka ntle.
So it worked and it worked well.	Kahoo, e ile ea sebetsa 'me ea sebetsa hantle.
And none of us could say anything about what happened.	Mme ha ho le ya mong wa rona ya neng a ka bua letho ka se etsahetseng.
Thank you for your valuable feedback.	Kea leboha ka maikutlo a hau a bohlokoa.
It just has to look good.	E tlameha ho shebahala hantle feela.
It was easier now.	Ho ne ho se ho le bonolo hona joale.
So go ahead.	Kahoo tsoela pele.
You will see it in his old work.	U tla e bona mosebetsing oa hae oa khale.
He can do everything.	A ka etsa tsohle.
Maybe you are.	Mohlomong u joalo.
Most of the people here understand the danger.	Batho ba bangata ba mona ba utloisisa kotsi.
No one should come in or go out.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho kena kapa ho tsoa.
But we have no better way to try this.	Empa ha re na mokhoa o betere oa ho leka sena.
He used to come here and he just does.	O kile a fihla mona mme o etsa feela.
I do not believe so.	Ha ke lumele hore ho joalo.
By this time he knew he could not live.	Ka nako ena o ne a tseba hore a ke ke a phela.
Yours takes mine.	Wa hao o nka ya ka.
You have to have something weird.	U tlameha ho ba le ntho e makatsang.
I told her not to talk.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore a se ke a bua.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka etsa sena joang.
You once told me that.	O kile wa mpolella seo.
Everyone else does not get that opportunity.	Ba bang kaofela ha ba fumane monyetla oo.
How often do you meet?	Le kopana hangata hakae?
You have never been.	Ha o eso be teng.
Well after all.	Hantle ka mor'a tsohle.
He just wasn't the same.	Feela o ne a se a se joalo feela.
And he gave them to you.	'Me a fana ka tsona ho uena.
Use them instead of buying something new.	Sebelisa lintho tseo ho e-na le ho reka ntho e ncha.
Some of them are clear enough, but others.	Tse ling tsa tsona li hlakile ka ho lekaneng, empa tse ling.
I had to speak.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho bua.
What do you think was happening?	U nahana hore ho ne ho etsahala'ng?
You may have read about it.	Mohlomong u kile ua bala ka eona.
Can you help?	O ka thusa?
He was not and could not be.	O ne a se jwalo mme o ne a ke ke a ba teng.
The same is true for everyone.	Ho joalo le ka bohle.
But she is happy.	Empa o thabile.
He really wanted her.	Ehlile o ne a mo batla.
It's no use.	Ha ho na thuso.
Finally, he spoke.	Qetellong, o ile a bua.
He said he makes sure there are no problems.	O ile a re o etsa bonnete ba hore ha ho na mathata.
People live there a lot.	Batho ba lula moo haholo.
However, if it does, you need to make sure that you understand it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e etsa joalo, u lokela ho etsa bonnete ba hore ua e utloisisa.
We want to spend time with them.	Re batla ho qeta nako e ngata le bona.
The same sentiments may apply here.	Maikutlo a tšoanang a ka sebetsa mona.
He works in this area.	O sebetsa sebakeng sena.
There were things he wanted to know.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tseo a neng a batla ho li tseba.
Her hands are sweet.	Matsoho a hae a monate.
He did not even know what he would do if he did.	O ne a sa tsebe le hore na o tla etsa eng ha a ka etsa joalo.
Making everything seem simple.	Ho etsa hore tsohle li bonahale li le bonolo.
It was a great place to do some work.	E ne e le sebaka se setle sa ho etsa mosebetsi.
People had friends here.	Batho ba ne ba ena le metsoalle mona.
Although it was strange that he did not say it.	Leha e ne e le ntho e makatsang hore ebe o ne a sa e bolela.
I don’t think how hard that must be.	Ha ke nahane hore na hoo ho tlameha ho ba thata hakae.
I knew it was going to happen.	Ke ne ke tseba hore e tla etsahala.
It's the same thing.	Ke ntho e le 'ngoe.
It seems strange to me.	Ho bonahala eka ke ntho e makatsang ho nna.
Of course, there are many of them.	Ha e le hantle, ho na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
The real thing may no longer exist.	Ntho ea sebele e ka 'na ea se ke ea hlola e e-ba teng.
There was another man, a great man.	Ho ne ho ena le monna e mong, e moholo.
There is no hard feeling.	Ha ho na maikutlo a thata.
They felt our pain.	Ba ile ba utloa bohloko ba rōna.
I do not know if this will work.	Ha ke tsebe hore na sena se ka sebetsa.
So, it has to be simple.	Ka hona, e tlameha ho ba bonolo.
So they do not know where to look.	Kahoo ha ba tsebe moo ba lokelang ho sheba teng.
Too much sleep.	Ho robala haholo.
That was the kind of work that.	E ne e le mofuta oa mosebetsi oo.
I feel at home.	Ke ikutloa ke le hae.
This is true.	Ena ke 'nete.
I have time to come back.	Ke na le nako ea ho khutla.
He stopped and tried again.	O ile a ema mme a leka hape.
Things have to start anytime.	Lintho li tlameha ho qala neng kapa neng.
And soon he can do that well.	Mme kapele a ka etsa seo hantle.
Don't play with things.	U se ke ua bapala ka lintho.
Maybe I'll get these soon.	Mohlomong ke tla fumana tsena kapele.
People will tell you how they feel about it.	Batho ba tla u bolella hore na ba ikutloa joang ka eona.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
But that was a problem for another day.	Empa hoo e ne e le bothata bakeng sa letsatsi le leng hape.
Everyone must live with this new reality.	E mong le e mong o tlameha ho phela le 'nete ena e ncha.
It was time to do something.	E ne e se e le nako ea ho etsa ho hong.
He continued.	O ile a tsoela pele.
I am a very shy person.	Ke motho ea lihlong haholo.
I only want you.	Ke batla uena feela.
I hope he will be able to return home soon.	Ke tšepa hore o tla khona ho khutlela hae haufinyane.
More than one person.	Ho feta motho a le mong.
So he decided to go.	Kahoo, a etsa qeto ea ho ea moo.
His decision was my imagination.	Qeto ea hae e bile mohopolo oa ka.
He says he says it's not him, but.	O re o re ha se eena, empa.
It's a family, you go to them.	Ke lelapa, o ya bona.
If you can help anyone, you should help him.	Haeba u ka thusa mang kapa mang, u lokela ho mo thusa.
For water.	Bakeng sa metsi.
I love her and I don’t want to leave.	Kea mo rata 'me ha ke batle ho tsamaea.
I will go now.	Ke tla tsamaea hona joale.
That is not what we want.	Ha se seo re se batlang.
There was everything he could say, and nothing.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo a ka e buang, 'me ho se letho.
Maybe I could pay more.	Mohlomong nka lefa ho feta.
Or one of the best.	Kapa e 'ngoe ea tse ntle ka ho fetisisa.
You don't do that.	Ha o etse seo.
But wait, there is more.	Empa ema, ho na le ho feta.
But this is not fun.	Empa sena ha se monate.
This is what they do.	Sena ke seo ba se etsang.
You know what you need.	U tseba seo u se hlokang.
It's better that way.	Ho molemo ka tsela eo.
Until you get used to doing nothing.	Ho fihlela o tloaetse ho etsa letho.
One man.	Monna a le mong.
He asked to leave, begging and begging and suffering.	O ile a kōpa hore a tsamaee, a kōpa le ho kōpa le ho utloa bohloko.
I never told you that.	Ha ke eso o bolelle seo.
He had a feeling that something was wrong.	O ne a e-na le maikutlo a hore ho na le ho phoso.
Yours and yours and yours.	Ya hao le ya hao le ya hao.
It seemed like the same thing.	E ne eka ke ntho e le 'ngoe.
He cannot live alone.	A ke ke a dula a le mong.
I have taken anything since then.	Ke nkile eng kapa eng ho tloha nakong eo.
They may not like it but they cannot help it.	E ka 'na eaba ha ba e rate empa ha ba khone ho e thusa.
It was close but not necessarily.	E ne e le haufi empa e se hakaalo.
I was just beginning to know that something like this was going to happen.	Ke ne ke qala ho tseba hore ntho e kang ena e tla etsahala.
I'm still working there.	Ke ntse ke sebetsa moo.
It's time to go to school.	Ke nako ea ho ea sekolong.
We heard about it from the police team.	Re utloile ka eona sehlopheng sa mapolesa.
I love you so.	Ke u rata hoo.
Do you think that you are coming to me?	O nahana hore o tla ho nna?
Of course, it could be more.	Ha e le hantle, e ka ba ho feta.
Can you read and write?	Na u khona ho bala le ho ngola?
But they were not enough.	Empa li ne li sa lekana.
However, they did find his books.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ile ba fumana libuka tsa hae.
I will sleep with them.	Ke tla robala le bona.
But it was so much fun.	Empa ho ne ho le monate haholo.
Then he came out.	Eaba oa tsoa.
And that will probably take years.	Mme mohlomong hoo ho tla nka lilemo.
See what he does.	Bona seo a se etsang.
I do not want to do that.	ha ke batle ho etsa joalo.
Here is a lot of ground space you know.	Mona ke sebaka se ngata sa fatše seo u se tsebang.
Then, he did.	Joale, o ile a etsa joalo.
It can't finish it.	Ha e khone ho e qeta.
He would fall.	O ne a tla wa.
The bad thing is that it's hard to find.	Ntho e mpe ke hore ho thata ho e fumana.
Everything else was very good.	Lintho tse ling tsohle li ne li le ntle haholo.
I was glad to see her.	Ke ile ka thabela ho mo bona.
He does not know that it is us.	Ha a tsebe hore ke rona.
They were all high.	E ne e le bohle ba phahameng.
Time is running out.	Nako e ntse e tsoela pele.
So next time, think more.	Kahoo nakong e tlang, nahana haholoanyane.
Once you get used to it, however, it works very well.	Hang ha u se u e tloaetse, leha ho le joalo, e sebetsa hantle haholo.
He did not know.	O ne a sa tsebe.
But he was by no means the last.	Empa ho hang e ne e se oa ho qetela.
I have no problems so far.	Ha ke na mathata ho fihlela joale.
First of all, we had money recently.	Pele ho tsohle, re ne re e-na le chelete haufinyane.
Too much for one person.	E ngata haholo bakeng sa motho a le mong.
It would be painful, of course.	Ho ne ho tla ba bohloko, ehlile.
I enjoyed that time.	Ke thabetse nako eo.
I just had to be here.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho ba mona feela.
I am no longer.	Ha ke sa le joalo.
Nothing seemed important.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se letho le bohlokoa.
It didn't seem to work.	E ne e sa bonahale e sebetsa.
But there was nothing he could do about it.	Empa ho ne ho se seo a ka se etsang ka hona.
You know this like us.	U tseba sena joaloka rona.
I really had.	Ke ne ke hlile ke na le.
I did not know how to learn.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ho ithuta.
Are you sure about this ?.	O na le bonnete ka taba ee?.
And so are we.	Mme le rona re jwalo.
At the time, it probably didn’t matter.	Ka nako eo, mohlomong ho ne ho se taba.
Will you buy that?	O tla reka seo?
I was expecting this.	Ke ne ke lebeletse sena.
But it often happens just enough for one to know.	Empa ho etsahala hangata ho lekana hore motho a tsebe.
People really need this.	Batho ba hlile ba hloka sena.
And nothing happened.	Mme ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala.
No one knows what will happen tomorrow, ever.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang se tla etsahala hosane, le ka mohla.
Certainly, there must be a better way.	Ka sebele, ho tlameha ho be le tsela e betere.
This is very important.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo.
No thanks.	Che, kea leboha.
So much for one power.	Haholo ka matla a le mong.
Stop being silly.	Tlohela ho hloka kelello.
Best of both of us.	Ea molemo ka ho fetisisa ho rona ka bobeli.
Check it out here to help you find out more.	Sheba mona ho u thusa ho tseba tsa hau.
It was good for me.	Ho ne ho le molemo ho nna.
I wanted to tell you the truth.	Ke ne ke batla ho bua 'nete le uena.
It was home.	E ne e le hae.
We are of no use to him.	Ha re na thuso ho eena.
Kind of weird.	Mofuta o makatsang.
This is my job going forward.	Ona ke mosebetsi oa ka ho ea pele.
I want to know what's going on here.	Ke batla ho tseba hore na ho etsahalang mona.
Yet he knew he had to go.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a tseba hore o tlameha ho tsamaea.
However, he did not say it.	Leha ho le jwalo, ha a ka a e bua.
We've done it now, and maybe a week is too late.	Re e entse hona joale, 'me mohlomong beke e se e le morao haholo.
You have it.	U na le eona.
I felt better.	Ke utloile ho le molemo.
I don't want to work anywhere.	Ha ke batle ho sebetsa kae kapa kae.
I knew that was the reason.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ke lona lebaka.
That takes years to take, to learn.	Seo se nka lilemo ho nka, ho ithuta.
However, it is good.	Leha ho le joalo, e ntle.
That did not happen very often.	Seo ha sea ka sa etsahala hangata.
But there was still money there.	Empa ho ne ho ntse ho e-na le chelete moo.
The boy was very happy.	Moshanyana eo o ne a thabile haholo.
I was also really talking.	Le ’na ke ne ke hlile ke bolela.
He is not a morning man.	Ha se motho oa hoseng.
This happens very often.	Sena se etsahala hangata haholo.
I'm still there.	Ke ntse ke le teng.
I still am.	Ke ntse ke le joalo.
Maybe he had done it this year.	Mohlomong o ne a e entse selemong sena.
I have had the same pain for several years.	Ke bile le bohloko bo tšoanang ka lilemo tse ’maloa.
Don't have a problem.	U se ke ua ba le bothata.
It was his great opportunity.	E ne e le monyetla oa hae o moholo.
It should work.	E lokela ho sebetsa.
I want to know why.	Ke batla ho tseba lebaka.
Most people knew.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba tseba.
Because it matters.	Hobane e bohlokoa.
I did not like it.	Ke ne ke sa e rate.
This went on for a long time.	Sena se ile sa tsoela pele ka nako e telele.
Some will be gone forever.	Ba bang ba ke ke ba hlola ba e-ba teng.
Night fell.	Bosiu bo ile ba kena.
You should do this several times a day.	U lokela ho etsa sena ka makhetlo a 'maloa ka letsatsi.
I have to say.	Ke tlameha ho bua.
We start walking as he tells me this.	Re qala ho tsamaea ha a ntse a mpolella sena.
He had one now.	O ne a ena le e mong jwale.
Obviously they had no time.	Ho hlakile hore ba ne ba se na nako.
He never mentioned this.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka sena.
When the man goes out, the woman comes in.	Ha monna a tsoa, ​​mosali oa kena.
There is no such thing.	Haho ntho e joalo.
However, that is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se taba eo.
We are just talking about what we know.	Re bua feela ka seo re se tsebang.
Continue to plan for those who can.	Tsoela pele ho rera ba ka khonang.
He did not care to do so.	O ne a sa tsotelle ho etsa joalo.
Of course, you are not.	Ehlile, ha u joalo.
They knew nothing about such a thing.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe letho ka ntho e joalo.
They were stronger than he was.	Ba ne ba le matla ho mo feta.
I did well to use that name.	Ke entse hantle ka ho sebelisa lebitso leo.
So more than that.	Kahoo ho feta moo.
He would not tell me anything.	O ne a sa tlo mpolella letho.
This was something he had to do alone.	Ena e ne e le ntho eo a neng a lokela ho e etsa a le mong.
I mean, it's a long time ago.	Ke bolela hore ke nako ea khale.
We can't have that.	Re ka se be le seo.
We can help you find it.	Re ka u thusa ho e fumana.
The old and the new will be here.	Ea khale le e ncha e tla ba teng mona.
You cannot proceed with this process.	Ha o khone ho tsoela pele ka mokhoa ona.
It took three days.	Ho ile ha nka matsatsi a mararo.
You want someone you love.	U batla motho eo u mo ratang.
Finally he stood up.	Qetellong a ema ka maoto.
Or maybe they say nothing at all.	Kapa mohlomong ha ba bue letho ho hang.
I knew he knew everything about me.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o tseba ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe ka ’na.
Not to mention, it's fun to play with.	Re sa bue, ho monate ho bapala le.
Everything else seemed trivial.	Lintho tse ling kaofela li ne li bonahala e se tsa bohlokoa.
It's up to you people.	Ho ho lona batho.
My mother loved it there.	'Mè o ne a e rata moo.
It will continue as you go.	E tla tsoela pele ha u tsamaea.
Yet no one.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho motho.
Yes! 	Ee!
But he knew it was so.	Empa o ne a tseba hore ho jwalo.
He was arrested right there.	O ile a tšoaroa hona moo.
He needed nothing.	O ne a sa hloke letho.
He is still there.	O ntse a le teng.
It could not be.	E ne e ka se be jwalo.
Family is everything.	Lelapa ke tsohle.
Go a lot.	Tsamaea haholo.
But it was useless.	Empa e ne e se na thuso ea letho.
Except for that fun time it was fun.	Ntle le nako eo e monate e ne e le monate.
As a result, we.	Ka lebaka leo, re .
Food was not enough.	Lijo li ne li sa lekana.
I did not even know how he felt.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe le hore na o ikutloa joang.
Sleep fast from now on!	Robala kapele ho tloha joale ho ea pele!
They all wear it.	Bohle ba a apara.
Obviously there has to be.	Ho hlakile hore ho lokela ho ba teng.
Can you still eat?	U ntse u ka ja?
We work it out.	Rea e sebetsa.
So there is something there.	Kahoo ho na le se seng moo.
It will write more.	E tla ngola ho feta.
He arrived just in time to see her.	O ile a fihla ka nako ho tla mo bona.
I would love to see her again.	Nka thabela ho mo bona hape.
We did not reach that level.	Ha rea ​​ka ra fihlela boemo boo.
I was thinking about you today.	Ke ne ke ntse ke nahana ka uena kajeno.
However, that would probably be better.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong hoo ho ka ba molemo.
He can't drive.	Ha a khone ho khanna.
They are very important to me.	Ke ba bohlokoa haholo ho 'na.
He is more of a man than he is.	O monna ho feta kamoo a leng kateng.
What can he see in her?	A ka bona eng ho eena?
I couldn't take the baby now.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho nka ngoana hona joale.
But that doesn't seem to be happening here.	Empa seo ha se bonahale se etsahala mona.
I will try this again.	Ke tla leka sena hape.
We refuse to proceed.	Re hana ho tsoela pele.
I was devastated.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko haholo.
But let me see.	Empa e re ke bone.
Re-apply if necessary.	Etsa kopo hape ha ho hlokahala.
There is nothing left.	Ha ho sa na letho.
And you certainly did.	'Me ka sebele u entse joalo.
I didn't hear anything like that that night.	Ha kea ka ka utloa letho la mofuta oo bosiung boo.
But never think.	Empa le ka mohla u se ke ua nahana.
Please share your thoughts.	Ke kopa o bue ka maikutlo a hau.
Or they may tell you something that is not true.	Kapa ba u bolella ntho eo e seng 'nete.
It was no surprise.	Ho ne ho se ntho e makatsang.
We've been here a very long time.	Re bile mona nako e telele haholo.
And he had nothing to do with it.	'Me o ne a se na lintho tsa ho e etsa.
He felt like he had just been in a car accident.	O ne a utloa eka o sa tsoa ba kotsing ea koloi.
But he is not.	Empa ha a joalo.
They were too many.	Ba ne ba le ngata haholo.
But maybe that's a good thing.	Empa mohlomong ke ntho e ntle.
Several people live near the area.	Batho ba ’maloa ba lula haufi le sebaka sena.
They were always very helpful and made our day fun.	Ba ne ba lula ba thusa haholo mme ba etsa hore letsatsi la rona le be monate.
I'm glad to see you wearing new clothes.	Ke thabetse ho bona hore o apere liaparo tse ncha.
However, this is not my case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se taba ea ka.
You will stay here.	U tla lula mona.
None of these are easy.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona e bonolo.
I want what it is.	Ke batla seo e leng sona.
I will talk to other people.	Ke tla bua le batho ba bang.
None of them.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
You are never alone.	Ha ho mohla u leng mong.
She is very heavy.	O boima haholo.
But it will be well.	Empa e tla phela hantle.
I'm not playing anymore.	Ha ke sa bapala.
They are doing this year.	Ba etsa selemong sena.
Thank you for the great work.	Kea leboha ka mosebetsi o moholo.
He might try, though.	A ka nna a leka, leha ho le jwalo.
They know you and they know why.	Baa u tseba 'me baa tseba hore na hobane'ng.
Now that is no longer the case.	Joale ha ho sa le joalo.
He can do nothing.	A ke ke a etsa letho.
He found her very sweet.	O ile a mo fumana a le monate haholo.
We are working on it.	Re ntse re e sebetsa.
He spoke at length.	O ile a bua nako e telele.
It is best not to walk alone.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua tsamaea u le mong.
But the worst was yet to come.	Empa tse mpe ka ho fetisisa li ne li sa tla.
If we continue with our own.	Haeba re tsoela pele ka tsa rona.
That's right, for everything.	Ke hantle, ho tsohle.
The man said he had to go to work.	Monna o ile a re o tlameha ho kena mosebetsing.
Say thank you.	E re kea leboha.
Like a father before me.	Jwalo ka ntate pele ho nna.
It was coming to me, too.	E ne e fihla ho nna, hape.
Here is the best thing you can do with them.	Mona ke ntho e ntle ka ho fetisisa eo u ka e etsang le bona.
Only one person could understand.	Ke motho a le mong feela ea neng a ka utloisisa.
You buy them.	U li reka.
They have to pass.	Ba tlameha ho feta.
But it is still going on.	Empa e ntse e tsoela pele.
But you passed.	Empa u ile ua feta.
He's been here before.	O bile mona pele.
He really loves her.	O hlile o mo rata.
You would forget.	U ne u tla lebala.
He has always had it.	Haesale a e-na le eona.
I really like this.	Ke rata sena haholo.
I will tell them what we are.	Ke tla ba bolella seo re leng sona.
I found it hard not to work in any other way.	Ke ile ka fumana ka thata hore e ke ke ea sebetsa ka tsela e 'ngoe.
I could not see who he was, but there was someone.	Ke ne ke sa bone hore na ke mang, empa ho ne ho e-na le motho.
It was, it is no longer.	E ne e le eona, ha ho sa le joalo.
We could find him if we wanted to, of course.	Re ne re ka mo fumana ha re batla, ehlile.
You will be able to have the time you want.	U tla khona ho ba le nako eo u batlang ka eona.
It's a place to start.	Ke sebaka sa ho qala.
I'm in pain here.	Ke utloa bohloko mona.
But she did not understand him.	Empa ha aa ka a mo utloisisa.
How does that work? 	Seo se sebetsa joang?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
Everyone knew it, of course.	E mong le e mong o ne a e tseba, ehlile.
He has to come right.	O tlameha ho tla hantle.
One son.	Mora a le mong.
And it came to me.	Mme ya tla ho nna.
Any help can be very helpful.	Thuso efe kapa efe e ka thusa haholo.
And that's the problem.	Mme ke bothata.
It's too late for me, now.	E se e le morao haholo ho nna, jwale.
I would love that very much.	Nka rata seo haholo.
So together they went hand in hand.	Kahoo hammoho ba ile ba tsamaea ka matsoho.
Now, don't forget.	Jwale, o seke wa lebala.
He finished the call.	A qeta mohala.
We had become good friends.	Re ne re bile metsoalle e molemo.
Because that's where the money is.	Hobane ke hona moo chelete e leng teng.
And they are still going to have to pay that money.	'Me ba ntse ba tla tlameha ho lefa chelete eo.
I don't care about them, you know, it's just mine.	Ha ke tsotelle taba tsa bona, ua tseba, ke tsa ka feela.
He has done a great, great work.	O entse mosebetsi o moholo, o moholo.
I will talk more.	Ke tla bua ho feta.
Maybe you were not.	Mohlomong u ne u se joalo.
That's just the mind.	Seo ke kelello feela.
Now you see it, now you don't see it.	Jwale o a e bona, jwale ha o e bone.
I found his place.	Ke ile ka fumana sebaka sa hae.
But they need to be able to work with you, too.	Empa ba hloka ho khona ho sebetsa le uena, hape.
People knew him by his emotions, if nothing else.	Batho ba ne ba mo tseba ka maikutlo a hae, haeba ho se letho le leng.
They cannot live without me.	Ba ke ke ba phela ntle le nna.
It fits right in with my dog.	E lekana hantle le ntja ea ka.
I may not know.	Le ka 'na ha ke tsebe.
There was no such thing.	Ho ne ho se letho le joalo.
That is what happened.	Ke sona se ileng sa etsahala.
That's where they would get to.	Ke moo ba neng ba tla fihla teng.
The boy felt tenderly touched by his father.	Moshanyana o ile a ikutloa a tšoeroe ka bonolo ke ntate oa hae.
The more he studied, the more he had questions.	Ha a ntse a ithuta haholoanyane, o ne a e-ba le lipotso tse ngata.
Things were not going well.	Lintho li ne li sa tsamaee hantle.
You just dropped it.	U sa tsoa e tlohela.
And it still does.	Mme e ntse e etsa jwalo.
Either way, any time.	Tsela efe kapa efe, nako efe kapa efe.
He was like that too.	Le eena o bile joalo.
But I’m happy, too.	Empa ke thabile, hape.
I should not have done this.	Ha kea lokela ho etsa sena.
He is the one who spoke.	Ke eena ea buileng.
Sometimes that goes well, and sometimes it doesn't.	Ka linako tse ling hoo ho tsamaea hantle, 'me ka linako tse ling ha ho joalo.
Lots of stuff.	Lintho tse ngata.
Maybe someone more.	Mohlomong motho e mong ho feta.
I mean, sometimes, everyone goes.	Ke bolela, ka nako e 'ngoe, bohle ba tsamaea.
It would not work.	E ne e ke ke ea sebetsa.
He could not walk.	O ne a sitoa ho tsamaea.
I feel.	Ke ikutloa.
Look, if you're going to do this, do it right.	Sheba, ha o tla etsa sena, etsa hantle.
They want it.	Ba e lakatsa.
Never forget it.	O seke oa e lebala le ka mohla.
Where will we stay tonight?	Re tla hlola kae bosiung bona?
He looks very tired.	O shebahala a khathetse haholo.
If you have it, go for it.	Haeba u na le eona, tsamaea.
That's what he is.	Ke seo a leng sona.
This is certainly true.	Ka sebele sena ke 'nete.
He did not mention that he knew who he was.	Ha aa ka a bua ka taba ea hore oa tseba hore na ke mang.
It's more fun than that.	Taba e monate ho feta.
Just exactly like yesterday.	Hantle feela joalo ka maobane.
See	Ea bona
But no, it was true.	Empa che, e ne e le ’nete.
Then I had to buy it.	Eaba ke tlameha ho e reka.
Somehow it was difficult to talk to him.	Ka tsela e itseng ho ne ho le thata ho bua le eena.
This is my best job so far.	Ona ke mosebetsi oa ka o motle ho fihlela joale.
He decided the accident.	O ile a etsa qeto ea kotsi.
The shoes were the ones that got him.	Lieta ke tsona tse ileng tsa mo fihlela.
We are what we are.	Re seo re leng sona.
It did not.	Ha ea ka ea etsa joalo.
He understood that he had a job to do.	O ne a utloisisa hore o na le mosebetsi oo a lokelang ho o etsa.
He knew that it would be several years before they met again.	O ne a tseba hore ho ka feta lilemo tse ’maloa pele ba kopana hape.
I felt good to finally say it.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ho le monate hore qetellong ke e bue.
My hands were strong.	Matsoho a ka a ne a le matla.
Find a way.	Fumana tsela.
Things seemed to be getting better.	Lintho li ne li bonahala li le betere le ho feta.
It is important for me to be healthy.	Ho bohlokoa ho 'na ho phela hantle.
I had no son.	Ke ne ke se na mora.
It will not take long.	E ke ke ea nka nako e telele.
We are still eating the food we are going to eat anyway.	Re ntse re ja lijo tseo re tlang ho li ja leha ho le joalo.
And of course, they want to win.	Mme ehlile, ba batla ho hlola.
I would be there all night.	Ke ne ke tla ba teng bosiu bohle.
Everyone is happy.	Bohle ba thabile.
I did not want to sleep.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho robala.
They are always there for me.	Ba lula ba le teng bakeng sa ka.
They have never met.	Ha ba eso kopane.
I need coffee.	Ke hloka kofi.
Just leave.	Tloha feela.
And nobody was going to buy it.	Mme ho ne ho se motho ya tla e reka.
So, that's a good thing.	Kahoo, ke ntho e ntle.
It was really nice.	E ne e hlile e le ntle.
These issues can only be psychological.	Litaba tsena li ka ba tsa kelello feela.
She had only one child.	O ne a e-na le ngoana a le mong feela.
I love you, and your kids are fun.	Kea u rata, 'me bana ba hau ba monate.
To me, but you know, of course.	Ho 'na, empa ua tseba, ha e le hantle.
Of course there are regrets.	Ehlile ho na le masoabi.
People are calling and asking about another girl.	Batho ba ntse ba letsa ba botsa ka ngoanana e mong.
Whatever you do, go ahead.	Eng kapa eng eo u e etsang, tsoela pele.
They have never been human.	Ha ba eso be batho.
I don't know who did it.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke mang ea entseng.
When you look at them, they are.	Ha u li sheba, li joalo.
Just right, right there.	Hantle feela, hona moo.
He will make the decision.	Ke eena ea tla etsa qeto.
Fast forward.	Kapele le kapele.
However, this did not help either.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha sea ka sa thusa hape.
It will be there tonight.	E tla ba teng bosiung bona.
We must do it for our children.	Re tlameha ho e etsetsa bana ba rona.
They feel.	Ba ikutloa.
It was useless to try again.	Ho ne ho se na thuso ho leka hape.
We have one here, too.	Re na le e 'ngoe mona, hape.
It's just that we're too busy.	Ke feela hore re phathahane haholo.
Not that we have not tried.	Ha se hore ha rea ​​ka ra leka.
I hope you understand !.	Kea tšepa ua utloisisa!.
They tried to tell us.	Ba ile ba leka ho re bolella.
The first one is a little easier.	Ea pele e batla e le bonolo.
They too seemed tired.	Le bona ba ne ba bonahala ba khathetse.
There has to be a way to make money with it.	Ho tlameha ho ba le mokhoa oa ho etsa chelete ka eona.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho tsamaea joale.
And so they never got that.	Mme ka hona ha ba eso fumane seo.
It wasn't exactly what it looked like, you know.	E ne e se hantle kamoo e neng e shebahala kateng, ua tseba.
They consider them to be very dangerous.	Ba li nka li le kotsi haholo.
Your approach should be positive.	Mokhoa oa hau o lokela ho ba hantle.
We did not know why.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na bakeng sa eng.
Time is of the essence.	Nako ke ntho ea bohlokoa.
You know that this is true.	Ua tseba hore sena ke 'nete.
I see now something I can do.	Ke bona hona joale ho hong hoo nka ho etsang.
Water cannot help for long.	Metsi ha a khone ho thusa nako e telele.
But kids will ask, because asking is what kids do.	Empa bana ba tla botsa, hobane ho botsa ke seo bana ba se etsang.
The food became even more delicious.	Lijo tsa e-ba monate le ho feta.
I don't think he really believed he was doing anything wrong.	Ha ke nahane hore o ne a hlile a lumela hore o ne a etsa letho le phoso.
I called him.	Ke ile ka mo letsetsa.
Sometimes that was the only thing that helped.	Ka linako tse ling ke eona feela ntho e neng e thusa.
I just don't know how to make it so.	Ke mpa ke sa tsebe ho etsa hore ho be jwalo.
My wife and children are still there.	Mosali oa ka le bana ba ntse ba le teng.
He is always on time.	O dula a le ka nako.
Still, of course.	Ho ntse ho le joalo, ha e le hantle.
Be sure of that.	Eba le bonnete ba seo.
That's almost everyone.	Ke hoo e ka bang bohle.
This is a great place.	Sena ke sebaka se setle.
I do not want to stand.	Ha ke batle ho ema.
But think of it.	Empa nahana ka hona.
However, during dinner, he suffered.	Leha ho le joalo, nakong ea lijo tsa mantsiboea, o ile a utloa bohloko.
Of course, that is not the case.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho joalo.
But we may not like it at all.	Empa ho etsahala hore re se ke ra e rata.
Everyone else knows what they are doing.	Batho ba bang kaofela ba tseba seo ba se etsang.
So you may need to buy it.	Kahoo u ka 'na ua hloka ho e reka.
Even with their name, you are still the style.	Leha e le ka lebitso la bona, o ntse o le mokhoa.
Now, it's your turn.	Jwale, ke nako ya hao.
He likes to swim.	O rata ho sesa.
It made me strong.	E entse hore ke be matla.
If not, ask anyone near you.	Haeba ho se joalo, botsa mang kapa mang ea haufi le uena.
It just starts.	E qala feela.
He was very active and helpful.	O ne a sebetsa haholo a bile a thusa.
What you do is important.	Seo u se etsang se bohlokoa.
Don't you think it's time to retire?	Na ha u nahane hore ke nako ea ho tlohela mosebetsi?
To know more.	Ho tseba ho feta.
That is, if you know what is best for you.	Ke hore, haeba u tseba se molemo ho uena.
I believe in everything that is within me that exists.	Ke lumela ka ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ka ho 'na eo e leng teng.
This can go on for days.	Sena se ka tsoela pele ka matsatsi.
Say everything you want.	Bua tsohle tseo u li batlang.
But it is still happening.	Empa ho ntse ho etsahala.
They have never been like that.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba joalo.
However, to continue.	Leha ho le joalo, ho tsoela pele.
They used it.	Ba ile ba e sebelisa.
I thought there was something wrong.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho na le phoso.
It should be very fun.	E lokela ho ba monate haholo.
He did just that.	O ile a etsa joalo.
It will work.	E tla sebetsa.
It looks good.	E shebahala e le ntle.
For your strength.	Bakeng sa matla a hao.
We slept late at night.	Re ile ra robala bosiu haholo.
He acted as if it were nothing to him.	O entse joalo ka ha eka ha se letho ho eena.
This house is beautiful.	Ntlo ena e ntle.
I still feel a little tired lately.	Ke ntse ke ikutloa ke khathetse hanyane haufinyane.
It could be you or me.	E ka ba uena kapa 'na.
But it's yours.	Empa ke ea hau.
They really do.	Ba hlile ba etsa joalo.
That probably exists.	Eo mohlomong e leng teng.
My head was empty.	Hlooho ea ka e ne e se na letho.
They refuse to me.	Ba hana ho 'na.
It could have been, of course.	Ho ka be ho bile teng, ehlile.
Every now and then.	Nako le nako.
I can no longer find it.	Ha ke sa khona ho e fumana.
We were gone, but we were not going.	Re ne re ile, empa re ne re sa tsamaea.
I can no longer do any more.	Ha ke sa khona ho etsa tse ling hape.
He gives her his name.	O mo fa lebitso la hae.
Do not use hands or arms.	U se ke ua sebelisa matsoho kapa matsoho.
None of them worked.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona e ileng ea sebetsa.
We wanted him to know our pain.	Re ne re batla hore a tsebe bohloko ba rōna.
He didn't care at all, of course.	O ne a sa tsotelle ho hang, ehlile.
Do it every day.	Etsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
Some of them agreed.	Ba bang ba bona ba ile ba lumela.
You can use it too.	Le uena u ka mo sebelisa.
In the end, he does.	Qetellong, oa etsa joalo.
But every day he spoke.	Empa letsatsi le letsatsi o ne a bua.
And he suggested that I see my podiatrist.	'Me o ile a etsa tlhahiso ea hore a bone ngaka ea ka ea maoto.
Read the decision.	Bala qeto.
Like, one.	Joalo ka, e le 'ngoe.
And the best.	Le tse ntle ka ho fetisisa.
You will really enjoy it.	O tla e thabela haholo.
No child can say that.	Ha ho ngoana ea ka buang joalo.
And we did nothing.	Mme ha rea ​​ka ra etsa letho.
It was really sad.	E ne e hlile e le masoabi .
He did not expect that.	O ne a sa lebella seo.
I loved those things.	Ke ne ke rata lintho tseo.
He always tells you.	O dula a o bolella.
No, you do not need my help.	Che, ha u hloke thuso ea ka.
I will be there for breakfast.	Ke tla ba teng ka nako ea lijo tsa hoseng.
They did not speak for very long.	Ha baa ka ba bua nako e telele haholo.
Or even more.	Kapa le ho feta.
They have to go back to school.	Ba lokela ho khutlela sekolong.
We start with that.	Re qala ka seo.
I wanted to feel something without pain.	Ke ne ke batla ho utloa ho hong ntle le bohloko.
And it really works.	'Me e hlile ea sebetsa.
They know him now.	Ba mo tseba hona joale.
Thank you so much for helping.	Ke leboha haholo ka ho thusa.
He fixed it again.	O ile a e lokisa hape.
More than this.	Ho feta mona.
And, what else.	Mme, ke eng hape.
It's hard to find.	Ho thata ho fumana.
He knows everything.	O tseba tsohle.
Your way is not mine.	Tsela ya hao ha se ya ka.
We are now able to move around the area.	Hona joale re khona ho tsamaea sebakeng.
I'll be back to check on you.	Ke tla khutla ho tla u sheba.
The night is falling.	Bosiu bo oa.
You do not have to be here.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u be mona.
You can buy better but spend more.	U ka reka betere empa u tla sebelisa chelete e ngata ho feta.
Will you	Na u tla
Maybe there is another reason.	Mohlomong ho na le lebaka le leng.
To do these things.	Ho etsa lintho tsena.
It seems very simple.	Ho bonahala ho le bonolo haholo.
It needs to be fixed.	Ho hlokahala ho e lokisa.
The same is true of humans	Batho le bona ba joalo
It's time.	Ke nako.
He saw nothing.	Ha aa ka a bona letho.
We have nothing tomorrow.	Ha re na letho hosane.
Maybe you say no.	Mohlomong u re che.
You take advantage of that.	O nka monyetla ka seo.
Everyone wants to keep it that way.	E mong le e mong o batla ho e boloka e le jwalo.
People can notice.	Batho ba ka hlokomela.
They've been here all along.	Esale ba le mona ka nako eohle.
Our lives have become much simpler with this.	Bophelo ba rona bo se bo le bonolo haholo ka sena.
I helped in some way.	Ke ile ka thusa ka mokhoa o itseng.
He would come often.	O ne a tla hangata.
We used to be friends.	Re kile ra ba metsoalle.
This worked for me recently.	Sena se ile sa sebetsa ho nna haufinyane.
But no one really knows about that until it really happens.	Empa ha ho motho ea tsebang seo ho fihlela se hlile se etsahala.
But even so.	Empa le ka hona.
I ask her if she wants to go back.	Kea mo botsa hore na o batla ho khutlela morao.
None of the things he could use.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea lintho tseo a neng a ka li sebelisa.
I need to watch it, but it is not.	Ke hloka ho e shebella, empa ha ho joalo.
All these children are his children.	Bana bohle ke bana ba hae.
I can tell you this, though.	Nka o bolella sena, leha ho le jwalo.
However, something like that.	Leha ho le joalo, ntho e kang eona.
I don't think I can say anything to him.	Ha ke nahane letho leo nka le buang le eena.
Why he was here was a question.	Ke hobane'ng ha a ne a le mona e ne e le potso.
I used to see him here.	Ke tloaetse ho mo bona mona.
And when he gets there, he does something.	Mme ha a fihla moo, o etsa ho hong.
My head hurts.	Hlooho ya ka e bohloko.
He has never seen this before.	Ha a eso bone sena pele.
And, some of these.	Mme, ba bang ba.
Each group has more people.	Sehlopha se seng le se seng se na le batho ba bangata.
Talk about why they do what they do.	Ho bua ka hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba etsa seo ba se etsang.
I did not take any money.	Ha kea ka ka nka chelete leha e le efe.
He knew when he had the good one.	O ne a tseba ha a ne a e-na le eona e ntle.
Watching it, playing it.	Ho e shebella, ho e bapala.
We'll take it from there.	Re tla e nka ho tloha moo.
Please do not read this book.	Ke kopa o seke oa bala buka ena.
I really like your style.	Ke rata mokhoa oa hau haholo.
It hurts a lot.	Ho bohloko haholo.
So he thought she was beautiful.	Kahoo a nahana hore o motle.
I'd like to see what else you have there.	Ke kopa ho bona hore na u na le eng hape moo.
Not everyone has to do both.	Ha se bohle ba lokelang ho etsa ka bobeli.
There is no place for you here.	Ha ho sebaka sa hau mona.
Right here at home.	Hantle mona hae.
I told her and asked her about it.	Ke ile ka mo bolella ’me ka mo botsa tsona.
So, who did you see today?	Joale, u bone mang kajeno?
It has never been.	Ha ho eso be teng.
You haven't seen anything.	Ha o eso bone letho.
It really needs to have some of both.	Ho hlile ho hlokahala hore ho be le tse ling tsa tsona ka bobeli.
You can’t be sure what’s just past.	U ke ke ua ba le bonnete ba hore na ke eng e sa tsoa feta.
Keep looking for it.	Tsoela pele ho e batla.
So thank you, me.	Kahoo kea leboha, 'na.
When in doubt.	Ha o belaela.
But then, for him, it probably happened.	Empa ka nako eo, bakeng sa hae, mohlomong ho ile ha etsahala.
I can't find this.	Ha ke fumane sena.
But it just needed to get started.	Empa ho ne ho hlokahala feela ho qala.
I certainly did not.	Ruri ha ke a etsa jwalo.
Thank you very much.	Ke leboha haholo.
I love when you are here.	Ke rata ha u le mona.
You should not get to the back of the group.	Ha oa lokela ho fihla morao ho sehlopha.
I think this is a good time.	Ke nahana hore nako ena e ntle.
We start with the mind.	Re qala ka kelello.
Sometimes, you forget to eat.	Ka linako tse ling, o lebala ho ja.
He spoke because he wanted to.	O ile a bua hobane a ne a batla.
We do not know exactly when he was.	Ha re tsebe feela hore na o ne a le teng ka nako mang.
He is a bad doctor.	Ke ngaka e mpe.
To say nothing.	Ho se bue letho.
I would love to see you.	Ke tla thabela ho o bona.
Things are not going well.	Lintho ha li tsamaee hantle.
I hope you will stop often.	Ke tšepa hore u tla ema hangata.
Neither would they.	Le bona ba ne ba ke ke ba etsa joalo.
Or maybe it's not their fault.	Kapa mohlomong ha se molato oa bona.
I didn't care.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle letho.
It will not be easy.	Ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
But he could not, nor could he pay them.	Empa o ne a sa khone, kapa a hana ho ba lefa.
He got three years for it.	O ile a fumana lilemo tse tharo bakeng sa eona.
There is nothing better.	Ha ho letho le betere.
Maybe he just likes to use them.	Mohlomong o mpa a rata ho li sebelisa.
They had nothing to say.	Ba ne ba sena seo ba ka se buang.
He was powerless.	O ne a se na matla.
Now it is his life.	Hona joale ke bophelo ba hae.
People had their problem.	Batho ba ne ba e-na le bothata ba bona.
I get that sometimes.	Ke fumana joalo ka linako tse ling.
It was not an easy decision.	E ne e se qeto e bonolo.
We enter.	Rea kena.
You can hear it.	U ka e utloa.
Probably to everyone who was with him.	Mohlomong ho e mong le e mong ea neng a e-na le eena.
Maybe it doesn't matter.	Mohlomong ha ho na taba.
More than enough.	Ho feta ho lekaneng.
My family and friends love this one too.	Lelapa la ka le metsoalle le bona ba rata ena.
This often works.	Sena se sebetsa hangata.
That is the only reason to do so.	Ke lona feela lebaka la ho etsa joalo.
I could understand why they did that.	Ke ne ke utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba entse joalo.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
But he is no longer at home.	Empa ha e sa le hae.
Continue home.	Tsoela pele hae.
We are of no use at all.	Ha re na thuso ho hang.
I ate breakfast to do.	Ke ile ka ja lijo tsa hoseng ho etsa.
It is even more important.	E bohlokoa ho feta.
I get it, you believe it is too late.	Kea e fumana, u lumela hore e se e le morao haholo.
There was no other way.	Ho ne ho se na mokhoa o mong.
And another, his.	Mme e mong, ya hae.
I did not know that.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe seo.
It is best to enjoy it that way.	Molemo ka ho fetisisa ke ho e thabela joalo.
But that is what is happening.	Empa ke se etsahalang.
The legal thing.	Ntho ea molao.
Age of some kind.	Lilemo tsa mofuta o itseng.
However, I do not think he will.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke nahane hore o tla etsa joalo.
If you need my help, just ask.	Haeba u hloka thuso ea ka, botsa feela.
I'm looking for him here now.	Ke mo batla mona hona joale.
The dog started barking after one of them.	Ntja e ile ea qala ho lla ka mor'a e 'ngoe ea tsona.
We hope you enjoy it !.	Re tšepa hore u tla thabela!.
It's nice to see you.	Ho monate ho o bona.
He did not need that.	O ne a sa hloke seo.
Look at his teacher.	Sheba tichere ea hae.
Obviously there is something wrong with the car.	Ho hlakile hore ho na le ho phoso ka koloi.
I, well, never.	Ke, hantle, le ka mohla.
So you just sleep.	Kahoo u robala feela.
Today, they do not.	Kajeno, ha ba etse joalo.
That's what the kids did.	Ke seo bana ba se entseng.
Everyone has their own ideas.	E mong le e mong o na le maikutlo a hae.
Something else, really.	Ntho e 'ngoe, ka 'nete.
I enjoy reading each of them.	Ke thabela ho bala e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
They have to stop.	Ba tlameha ho ema.
Of course we did not expect that to happen.	Ha e le hantle ha rea ​​lebella hore ho be joalo.
Where have you been?	U ne u ntse u le kae?
I had to finish him.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho mo qeta.
They must have had some time.	E tlameha ebe ba ne ba e-na le nako e itseng.
And now he had to leave her again.	Mme jwale o ne a lokela ho mo tlohela hape.
However, you get the idea.	Leha ho le joalo, u fumana mohopolo.
Life is not so simple.	Bophelo ha bo bonolo hakaalo.
It was not necessary.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale.
Or maybe this one.	Kapa mohlomong ena.
This happens very quickly.	Sena se etsahala kapele haholo.
You are too important to let go of it.	U oa bohlokoa haholo hore u ka tlohela.
It moves very fast and has amazing power.	E tsamaea kapele haholo 'me e na le matla a makatsang.
Will my son be a doctor?	Na mora oa ka e tla ba ngaka?
You don't seem to know what it is.	Ho bonahala eka ha u tsebe hore na ke eng.
They go very fast!	Li tsamaea kapele haholo!
I said it again.	Ka e bua hape.
I decided to tell them no.	Ke entse qeto ea ho ba bolella che.
It is neither good nor bad.	Ha e ntle kapa e mpe.
We are both, it seems.	Re bobeli, ho bonahala.
I knew that was not the case.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ha se taba eo.
Talk to anyone.	Bua le mang kapa mang.
It was even worse now, of course.	E ne e le mpe le ho feta joale, ehlile.
Thank you very much ahead of time.	Ke leboha haholo pele ho nako.
Yes, he could live out here.	E, o ne a ka phela ka ntle mona.
However, I have heard of him.	Leha ho le joalo, ke utloile ka eena.
There is no way.	Haho tsela.
It can help you.	E ka u thusa.
He asked if we wanted to play.	O ile a botsa hore na re batla ho bapala.
He was happy too.	O ne a thabile hape.
I see that in you.	Ke bona seo ho wena.
Everybody knows this.	Bohle ba bangata ba tseba sena.
Talk to her as this goes on.	Bua le eena ha sena se ntse se tsoela pele.
It's not as easy as it looks.	Ha ho bonolo joalo ka ha e shebahala.
Now do it.	Jwale e etse.
He tried again.	A leka hape.
It seemed to be the first of many.	E ne e bonahala e le ea pele ho tse ngata haholo.
We did it before.	Re e entse pele.
I was not around that.	Ke ne ke se haufi le seo.
They will do so in their own way, in their own time.	Ba tla etsa joalo ka tsela ea bona, ka nako ea bona.
Obviously this is a difficult issue.	Ho hlakile hore ena ke taba e thata.
It is not surprising.	Ha se ntho e makatsang.
The same is true of.	Ho joalo le ka ho.
You can see here, here, and here.	U ka bona mona, mona, le mona.
The one who did the wrong thing felt guilty.	Ea entseng ntho e mpe, o ne a ikutloa a le molato.
There is one for you, too.	Ho na le e 'ngoe bakeng sa hau, hape.
I had to think about that again.	Ke ne ke lokela ho nahana ka taba eo hape.
Only one was arrested.	Ho ile ha tšoaroa e le 'ngoe feela.
We have a work to do.	Re na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa.
Something important was happening.	Ntho ea bohlokoa e ne e etsahala.
Well, and a name.	Hantle, le lebitso.
Instead, they seem to be walking alone.	Ho e-na le hoo, ho bonahala eka ba tsamaea ba le bang.
You will get yours.	U tla fumana ea hau.
He had many interests.	O ne a e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a li ratang.
I was also affected by it.	Le ’na ke ile ka tšoaroa ke eona.
He reached out.	O ile a fihla ka ntle.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
This is likely to remain the case in the near future.	Sena se ka 'na sa lula se le joalo nakong e tlang e haufi.
So that should not be the case.	Kahoo seo ha sea lokela ho ba taba.
It was a strange feeling.	E ne e le maikutlo a makatsang.
We know that it can be difficult for some people to do that.	Rea tseba hore ho ka ba thata ho batho ba bang ho etsa joalo.
I need to know.	Ke hloka ho tseba.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
Very fond of you when you do that.	Ho rata haholo ha o etsa joalo.
I learned nothing about them.	Ha kea ka ka ithuta letho le leng ka bona.
I do not know how quickly he found it.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o e fumane kapele hakae.
Dad is trying to work.	Ntate o leka ho sebetsa.
Play just one.	Bapala se seng feela.
Maybe you should go with him?	Mohlomong u lokela ho tsamaea le eena?
Of course, it is.	Ha e le hantle, ho joalo.
We have to finish this.	Re tlameha ho qeta sena.
We need it more than ever.	Re e hloka ho feta leha e le neng pele.
That wasn't the worst thing, of course.	Hoo e ne e se ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa, ehlile.
No, they are not.	Che, ha li eo.
I forget who I am.	Ke lebala hore na ke mang.
They were close to meeting.	Ba ne ba le haufi le ho kopana.
Now she tries to go faster and fix things.	Hona joale e leka ho tsamaea kapele le ho lokisa lintho.
What he says is very true.	Seo a se buang ke 'nete haholo.
I take care of my family and myself by living this way.	Ke hlokomela lelapa la ka le ’na ka ho phela ka tsela ena.
He wanted to be with her.	O ne a batla ho ba le eena.
I never thought anyone would be able to walk so fast.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore ho na le motho ea tla khona ho tsamaea kapele hakaalo.
We want these.	Re batla tsena.
There is still too much in the book.	E ntse e le ngata haholo ka buka.
But that does not make it worse.	Empa seo ha se etse hore e be mpe.
It will be difficult either way.	Ho tla ba thata ka tsela efe kapa efe.
And we did that.	Mme re ile ra etsa seo.
We'll stay here tonight.	Re tla lula mona bosiung bona.
The first is legal.	Ea pele ke ea molao.
You do not earn money.	Ha o fumane chelete.
Meet others.	Kopana le ba bang.
I'm learning about it.	Ke ntse ke ithuta ka eona.
His wife had been in a car accident.	Mosali oa hae o ne a bile le kotsi ea koloi.
It was not a child's room.	E ne e se kamore ea ngoana.
We eat them every morning now.	Re li ja hoseng ho hong le ho hong hona joale.
He would do the same now.	O ne a tla etsa se tšoanang le hona joale.
One more thing.	Ntho e 'ngoe hape.
It's hard to catch up and win.	Ho thata ho tšoara le ho hlola.
He went into the bedroom.	A kena ka phaposing ya ho robala.
This place is very nice.	Sebaka sena se setle haholo.
Being able to use it is another matter.	Ho khona ho e sebelisa ke ntho e 'ngoe.
He never came out.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a tsoa.
But you do not know.	Empa ha o tsebe.
The car is no longer useful.	Koloi ha e sa na thuso.
Well, they want you now.	Be, ba o batla jwale.
In the morning there is no danger.	Hoseng ha kotsi.
We would love to hear your thoughts !.	Re ka thabela ho utloa maikutlo a hau!.
One can hear it.	Motho a ka e utloa.
Nothing to make time.	Ha ho letho la ho etsa nako.
This is no other.	Sena ha se e 'ngoe.
As they are doing it as you read this.	Joalo ka ha ba ntse ba e etsa ha u ntse u bala sena.
I passed them by.	Ka ba feta.
I wanted to be a mother one day.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba 'mè ka letsatsi le leng.
He made me talk last night, and he didn't deserve it.	O entse hore ke bue maobane bosiu, mme o ne a sa lokela.
Sometimes it happens, sometimes not.	Ka linako tse ling hoa etsahala, ka linako tse ling ha ho joalo.
I really didn't have to.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa tlameha.
He knew exactly why.	O ne a tseba hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
We are getting there.	Re ea fihla moo.
But it could be otherwise.	Empa ho ka ba ka tsela e ’ngoe.
But there is a problem with that.	Empa ho na le bothata ka seo.
I will watch you carefully.	Ke tla o shebella ka hloko.
They must work as a team.	Ba tlameha ho sebetsa e le sehlopha.
We don't need a reason.	Ha re hloke le lebaka.
But we must give it a chance.	Empa re tlameha ho e fa monyetla.
This week is tough.	Beke ena ke e thata.
This is what it looks like.	Sena ke hore na se shebahala joang.
Both times were equally difficult.	Linako tseo ka bobeli li ne li le boima ka ho tšoanang.
The child may know.	Ngoana a ka tseba.
I think he can do whatever he wants.	Ke nahana hore a ka etsa eng kapa eng eo a e batlang.
The food was delicious.	Lijo tse monate li ne li le monate.
So we know we are strong.	Kahoo rea tseba hore re matla.
However, that situation is unlikely.	Leha ho le joalo, boemo boo bo ke ke ba etsahala.
So, the police are back today.	Ka hona, mapolesa aa khutla kajeno.
You have to tell me something about yourself.	U tlameha ho mpolella ho hong ka uena.
He could forget everything, get into it.	O ne a ka lebala ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe, a kena ka ho eena.
If you do not like to buy.	Haeba u sa rate ho reka.
See how beautiful it is.	Sheba kamoo e leng ntle kateng.
That is what an expert would do.	Ke seo setsebi se neng se tla se etsa.
You thought they would never catch you.	U ne u nahana hore ba ke ke ba u tšoara.
I thought you should know.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o lokela ho tseba.
In fact, they are even worse.	Ha e le hantle, ba mpe le ho feta.
Now he lives alone.	Hona joale o lula a le mong.
This may be true, but we should not conclude the question.	Mohlomong sena ke 'nete, empa ha rea ​​​​lokela ho etsa qeto ea potso.
We love it.	Re a e rata.
Some may do so.	Ba bang ba ka 'na ba etsa joalo.
Have a long wait to hear him now.	E-ba nako e telele u emetse ho mo utloa hona joale.
Then you can start enjoying all you have.	Joale u ka qala ho thabela sohle seo u nang le sona.
I want to live longer.	Ke batla ho phela nako e telele.
The same is true of them.	Ho joalo feela ka bona.
Probably no one ever called.	Mohlomong ha ho motho ea kileng a letsetsa.
It is old but beautiful.	Ke ea khale empa e ntle.
Look.	Sheba.
But there were no people.	Empa ho ne ho se na batho.
When we get to it.	Ha re fihla ho eona.
What happens.	Ho etsahalang.
And thank goodness.	Le ho leboha molemo.
The last meal will not help the dog.	Lijo tsa ho qetela li ke ke tsa thusa ntja.
I had not thought about him for years.	Ke ne ke qetile lilemo ke sa nahane ka eena.
Or the power to try.	Kapa matla a ho leka.
Everyone has money.	Motho e mong le e mong o na le chelete.
We always wanted a son.	Kamehla re ne re batla mora.
We were just waiting.	Re ne re emetse feela.
I've never seen it before.	Ha ke eso e bone pele.
Everything you said is very true.	Sohle seo u se buileng ke 'nete haholo.
But this was news.	Empa tsena e ne e le litaba.
This is not a mistake.	Sena ha se phoso.
More than today for some time now.	Ho feta kajeno ka nako e itseng hona joale.
There was no time to stop and look at him.	Ho ne ho se nako ea ho ema le ho mo sheba.
It usually works with nothing.	Hangata e sebetsa e se na letho.
And you will have to ask him if his real name is.	'Me u tla tlameha ho mo botsa hore na ke lebitso la hae la sebele.
My house is nearby.	Ntlo ea ka e haufi.
Mother of all.	Mme wa bohle.
I will definitely look into this matter further.	Ka sebele ke tla sheba taba ena haholoanyane.
See? 	Le a bona?
And that is exactly what happened.	Mme ke sona se etsahetseng hantle.
He does not.	Ha a etse joalo.
I just a.	Ke feela a.
There would be no time.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha ba le nako.
We hope this helps people.	Rea tšepa hore sena se thusa batho.
It made her look happy even though she was not.	E ile ea etsa hore a bonahale a thabile le hoja a ne a se joalo.
We really like the place.	Re hlile re rata sebaka seo.
And it just starts.	Mme e qala feela.
How are you?	U phela joang.
It would be painful for both of us.	Ho ne ho tla ba bohloko ho rona ka bobeli.
He takes care of you.	Ua u hlokomela.
It had been a very long time.	E ne e se e le nako e telele haholo.
This is what happens.	Sena ke sona se etsahalang.
It was not clear who made it.	Ho ne ho sa tsebe hantle hore na ke mang ea e entseng.
He is not coming back.	Ha a sa khutla.
He came to me.	O ile a tla ho 'na.
I do not have these.	Ha ke na tsena.
No, maybe not at all.	Che, mohlomong ha se eona kaofela.
He calls or gives money.	Oa letsa kapa o fana ka chelete.
I do not see why he continued.	Ha ke bone hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ile a tsoela pele.
I saw one of them working recently.	Ke bone e 'ngoe ea tsona e ntse e sebetsa haufinyane.
Sometimes, no.	Ka linako tse ling, che.
We are not sure if we can trust these people.	Ha re tsebe hantle hore na re ka tšepa batho bana.
Join the writing team.	Kena sehlopheng sa ho ngola.
But it really isn't that hard.	Empa ha e le hantle ha ho thata hakaalo.
But it didn't really matter.	Empa ho ne ho se taba hakaalo.
Nice to know.	Ho monate ho tseba.
Few have it.	Ke ba ’maloa ba nang le eona.
Use as needed.	Sebelisa ha ho hlokahala.
If they do not seem to be there, ask.	Haeba ho bonahala eka ha ba eo, botsa.
It would be hard work.	E ne e tla ba mosebetsi o boima.
Just for you.	Bakeng sa hau feela.
But that is no longer the case.	Empa ha ho sa le joalo.
He was at school and came home with me.	O ne a le sekolong mme a khutlela hae le 'na.
It's a beautiful car.	Ke koloi e ntle.
I love her so much.	Ke mo rata haholo.
They are the ones who do it.	Ke bona ba e etsang.
He is a doctor.	O ngaka.
He could make food from just about anything.	O ne a ka etsa lijo ka eng kapa eng feela.
Yet they must.	Leha ho le joalo ba tlameha.
He tried to find out how old he must have been.	O ile a leka ho fumana hore na e tlameha ebe o ne a le lilemo li kae.
I had a weird surprise last week.	Ke bile le ntho e makatsang e makatsang bekeng e fetileng.
Maybe that's why they passed.	Mohlomong ke ka lebaka leo ba ileng ba feta.
I will never forget seeing you.	Nke ke ka lebala ho o bona.
I was too tired to eat.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo hore nka ja.
Yet we do so without hesitation.	Leha ho le joalo re etsa joalo ntle le ho belaela.
But that did not happen.	Empa ha hoa ka ha etsahala joalo.
You went on with your life, though.	U ile ua tsoela pele ka bophelo ba hao, leha ho le joalo.
But he did not think he would.	Empa o ne a sa nahane hore o tla etsa joalo.
He spoke to the police.	A bua le mapolesa.
The last one is the one that makes him leave in the morning.	Ea ho qetela ke eona e etsang hore a tsamaee hoseng.
But this, they know, is necessary.	Empa sena, baa tseba, sea hlokahala.
I need to work on that.	Ke hloka ho sebetsa ho seo.
Would you like to.	Na u ka hloka ho.
This may be easier said than done.	Sena se ka ba bonolo ho se bua ho feta ho se etsa.
But you don't.	Empa ha u etse joalo.
He did not know what he was thinking.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na o nahana eng.
But that is probably the point.	Empa mohlomong ke eona taba eo.
Only now can we know.	Ke hona joale feela re ka tsebang.
I'll tell you now.	Ke tla o bolella hona jwale.
Last year, he got there.	Selemong se fetileng, o ile a fihla moo.
Please more, more.	Ka kopo ho feta, ho feta.
Well, now is our time.	Be, joale ke nako ea rona.
I want to fix that.	Ke batla ho lokisa eo.
It wasn't, of course.	E ne e se, ehlile.
House was his very opinion, he admits.	Ntlo e ne e le maikutlo a hae haholo, a lumela.
Surprisingly, the car was like that.	Ho makatsang ke hore koloi e ne e le joalo.
We were tired when we got there.	Re ne re khathetse ha re fihla moo.
When does the opening ceremony begin?	Mokete oa ho bula o qala neng?
He refused to talk to her.	O ile a hana ho bua le eena.
It's nice to see you.	Ho monate ho o bona.
You will know them by their feet.	Le tla ba tseba ka maoto a bona.
We can still get there.	Re ntse re ka fihla moo.
I could not go anywhere.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ea kae kapa kae.
It was a search party.	E ne e le mokete oa ho batla.
He was not sure.	O ne a sena bonnete.
And it no longer has to be that way.	'Me ha ho sa hlokahala hore ho be joalo.
At the back of the house.	Ka morao ho ntlo.
Time to start fixing those clothes.	Nako ea ho qala ho lokisa liaparo tseo.
Bad news there.	Litaba tse mpe moo.
That's the hard part.	Ke tseo tse thata.
I will never have that sweet again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke e-ba le eona e monate joalo.
The whole thing is children.	Taba eohle ke bana.
Take a good look at us, 'he began.	Sheba hantle ka rona,' a qala.
Even more to think about it now.	Le ho feta ho nahana ka eona hona joale.
I have no idea it.	Ha ke na maikutlo ho eona.
His friends don't care about him either.	Metsoalle ea hae le eona ha e mo tsotelle.
I had to look at it.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho e sheba.
Then he said he wanted to sleep.	Eaba o re o batla ho robala.
No contact with anyone.	Ha ho kopane le mang kapa mang.
I hope this is not a mistake.	Ke tšepa hore sena ha se phoso.
The problem remains.	Bothata bo ntse bo le teng.
I did not understand why she did not understand.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ne a sa utloisise.
I know it.	Kea e tseba.
Maybe he was waiting for someone.	Mohlomong o ne a emetse motho.
No one rode.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a palama.
In fact, they are always there.	Ha e le hantle, ba lula ba le teng.
Every decision is more difficult than you used to do.	Qeto e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e thata ho feta kamoo u neng u tloaetse ho e etsa.
However, he had found something.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a fumane ho hong.
Now is the time to speak up.	Joale ke nako ea ho bua.
I wanted to do something that I would never do.	Ke ne ke batla ho etsa ntho e neng e ke ke ea etsa joalo.
That's not the way he went on.	Ha se tsela eo o ileng oa tsoela pele ka eona.
We do not.	Ha re etse joalo.
Be life.	E be bophelo.
For him, hard work benefited him.	Ho eena, mosebetsi o boima o ile oa mo tsoela molemo.
I have no problem at all with it.	Ha ke na bothata ho hang ka eona.
And how many.	Le tse kae.
Something powerful.	Ntho e matla.
The children do what they want.	Bana ba etsa seo ba se batlang.
But the people here do not know more.	Empa batho ba mona ha ba tsebe ho feta.
And we love them.	'Me re ba rata.
They have their whole life to live.	Ba na le bophelo bohle ba bona ba ho phela.
We do not believe that they saw us.	Ha re lumele hore ba re bone.
However, he did.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a etsa joalo.
You need to know something.	O lokela ho tseba ho hong.
You can do it at home.	U ka e etsa u le hae.
He never said anything about her.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua letho ka eena.
He was expecting this.	O ne a lebeletse sena.
That's where he has problems.	Ke moo a nang le mathata.
I was alone.	Ke ne ke le mong.
And do it fast, amazing.	'Me u e etse kapele, e makatsang.
But that is not true.	Empa hoo hase ’nete.
I really did not like this one.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa rate ena.
I don’t think we know much about his past life.	Ha ke nahane hore re tseba haholo ka bophelo ba hae ba nako e fetileng.
I was very happy at home.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo hae.
But both are present.	Empa ka bobeli ba teng.
We did not know the man's name.	Re ne re sa tsebe lebitso la monna eo.
It works all the time.	E sebetsa nako le nako.
It means that sometimes no one likes you at all.	Ho bolela hore ka linako tse ling ha ho motho ea u ratang ho hang.
He almost sang.	O ne a batla a bina.
It would have been easier.	Ho ka be ho bile bonolo.
Unless they do.	Ntle le ha ba sa etse joalo.
They would ask.	Ba ne ba tla botsa.
They were very fun.	Ba ne ba le monate haholo.
Here are some of them.	Tse ling ke tsena.
Lots of stuff.	Lintho tse ngata.
The road will be dangerous, but we have food and water.	Tsela e tla ba kotsi, empa re na le lijo le metsi.
They are many enough.	Ba ngata ho lekana.
I don't know what to do with them.	Ha ke tsebe hore na u ka etsa'ng ka tsona.
Some tried to move on.	Ba bang ba ile ba leka ho tsoela pele.
It is because we were tired.	Ke hobane re ne re khathetse.
The front door was behind the house.	Lemati le ka pele le ne le le ka morao ho ntlo.
It would not have been so difficult.	Ho ka be ho sa ka ha eba thata hakaalo.
Please consider this, any money helps.	Ka kopo nahana ka sena, chelete leha e le efe e thusa.
Very good thing.	Ntho e ntle haholo.
I'm talking to my team.	Ke bua le sehlopha sa ka.
That is more important than anything else.	Seo se bohlokoa ho feta eng kapa eng.
I could have refused it, though.	Ke ka be ke ile ka e hana, leha ho le jwalo.
And you should know.	Mme o lokela ho tseba.
But that is not very good.	Empa seo ha se setle haholo.
Maybe it was his.	Mohlomong e ne e le ea hae.
The man had them.	Monna eo o ne a na le tsona.
But he needed time to think.	Empa o ne a hloka nako ea ho nahana.
Back to back again.	Morao morao hape.
Drive carefully.	Khanna ka hloko.
In the end it was very easy.	Qetellong ho ne ho le bonolo haholo.
Go back to that moment.	Khutlela nakong e joalo.
To the group.	Ho sehlopha.
One has to be.	E 'ngoe e lokela ho ba.
But just a little bit.	Empa hanyane feela.
He will know what we need.	O tla tseba seo re se hlokang.
That's it.	Ke hona moo.
The boy was very gentle.	Moshanyana eo o ne a le bonolo haholo.
I was just starting to do that.	Ke ne ke qala ho etsa joalo.
But it is clear that their parents loved it.	Empa ho hlakile hore batsoali ba bona ba ne ba e rata.
He said when he got there he would know.	O itse ha a fihla moo o tla tseba.
You are not really guilty.	Ha o na molato ehlile.
First of all, most of them did not go.	Taba ea pele, ba bangata ba bona ba ne ba sa tsamaee.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Ha se lekhetlo la pele sena se etsahala.
He told me he didn't know.	O ile a mpolella hore ha a tsebe.
I found this the hard way.	Ke fumane sena ka tsela e thata.
It was as if some strange force made him do it.	E ne eka ke matla a mang a makatsang a entseng hore a e etse.
I knew you would want to spend time with him.	Ke ne ke tseba hore u tla batla nako le eena.
Talk to friends, or family, about this.	Bua le metsoalle, kapa ba lelapa hammoho ka sena.
It was good stuff.	E ne e le lintho tse molemo.
So they are.	Kahoo ba joalo.
Don't think about this.	U se ke ua nahana ka sena.
He had many things to be grateful for.	O ne a e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a lokelang ho li leboha.
The boy seems to have a knack for speaking.	Ho bonahala eka moshanyana eo o na le mokhoa oa ho bua.
However, make sure you know what you are talking about.	Leha ho le joalo, etsa bonnete ba hore u tseba seo u buang ka sona.
We have been visiting.	Re kile ra etela.
Think about how effective that was.	Nahana hore na seo se ne se sebetsa hantle hakae.
So they know what it is.	Kahoo baa tseba hore na ke eng.
Before we need a house.	Pele re hloka ntlo.
He wondered why.	A ipotsa hore na hobaneng.
They were waiting for something to happen	Ba ne ba emetse ho hong ho etsahala
Thanks for joining.	Ke leboha ho kena.
We had a wonderful day.	Re bile le letsatsi le monate.
He will only love her.	O tla mo rata feela.
Life was hard.	Bophelo bo ne bo le boima.
The doctor visits her every week.	Ngaka e mo etela beke le beke.
I knew that whatever he said would be.	Ke ne ke tseba hore eng kapa eng eo a e buang e tla ba eona.
It was very hard to let go of it.	Ho ne ho le boima haholo ho tlohela ho feta.
They stopped from time to time.	Ba ne ba ema nako le nako.
I am just a child.	Ke ngoana feela.
That can make it easier to keep going.	Seo se ka etsa hore ho be bonolo ho etsa monyetla oa ho tsoela pele.
Or find something better to do.	Kapa fumana ho hong ho betere ho etsa.
Having three is still a time saver.	Ho ba le tse tharo e ntse e le ho boloka nako.
But he does not.	Empa ha a etse seo.
You have to do it.	U lokela ho etsa joalo.
I have never been there before.	Ha ke eso be teng pele.
I will do the same for you.	Ke tla u etsetsa se tšoanang.
I know that seems to be a simple problem.	Kea tseba hore ho bonahala eka ke bothata bo bonolo.
You feel like something else.	U ikutloa joaloka ntho e 'ngoe.
I watched them for a long time.	Ke ile ka li shebella nako e telele.
So, if you haven’t read.	Kahoo, haeba u sa bala.
But you have to help us.	Empa u tlameha ho re thusa.
We did that.	Re entse seo.
I finished talking to mom.	Ke qetile ho bua le mme.
He called before he got here.	O ile a letsa pele o fihla mona.
Or maybe it’s a weird time again.	Kapa mohlomong ke nako e makatsang hape.
It saves a lot of time.	E boloka nako e ngata.
Some suggest that there may be.	Ba bang ba fana ka maikutlo a hore ho ka ba teng.
That’s what my old team was saying.	Ke seo sehlopha sa ka sa khale se neng se se bua.
See news.	Sheba litaba.
They had a great time.	Ba ne ba na le nako e monate.
And I'm not sure they'll be very helpful.	Hape ha ke na bonnete ba hore ba tla thusa haholo.
There were no problems.	Ho ne ho se na mathata.
You, too, do not need to know everything.	Le uena, ha ho hlokahale hore u tsebe tsohle.
Thank you for this opportunity.	Kea leboha ka nako ena.
I like to try, to try new things.	Ke rata ho leka, ho leka lintho tse ncha.
It is so easy for people to think that it is not enough.	Ho bonolo hoo batho ba nahanang hore ha hoa lekana.
Or it can do both at a time.	Kapa e ka etsa ka bobeli ka nako.
I do not understand these people.	Ha ke utloisise batho bana.
He was a boy.	E ne e le moshanyana.
I don't want to know anything.	Ha ke batle ho tseba letho.
None of us are coming today.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea tlang kajeno.
But there was no point in doing it.	Empa ho ne ho se na thuso bakeng sa eona.
His job was hard.	Mosebetsi oa hae o ne o le boima.
We were able to try a few things.	Re ile ra khona ho leka lintho tse seng kae.
People were coming back.	Batho ba ne ba khutla.
Why are they doing this?	Ke hobane’ng ha ba etsa see?
They all work well.	Kaofela ba sebetsa hantle.
Strong to come to him.	E matla ho tla ho eena.
This was close to me.	Sena se ne se le haufi le nna.
None of us will know.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea tla tseba.
Thank you and have a great time !.	Kea leboha 'me u be le nako e monate!.
That's what you want too.	Ke seo le uena u se batlang.
Just do it yourself.	Etsa feela uena.
It was simple, very simple.	E ne e le bonolo, e le bonolo haholo.
I told her I loved her.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore kea mo rata.
You just need something to help you.	U hloka feela ho hong ho u thusa.
The second day would see more.	Letsatsi la bobeli le ne le tla bona ho feta.
We all love you.	Kaofela rea ​​u rata.
It does.	E etsa'ng.
Everything is going well, though.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e tsamaea hantle, leha ho le joalo.
They did not ask.	Ha ba ka ba botsa.
I needed to catch him.	Ke ne ke hloka ho mo tšoara.
Today, it has only one.	Kajeno, e na le e le 'ngoe feela.
I have never had a problem.	Ha ke eso be le bothata.
You are the exact same person then.	U motho ea tšoanang hantle ka nako eo.
Stay here as long as you need to.	Lula mona nako e telele kamoo u hlokang kateng.
But he could not.	Empa ha aa ka a khona.
It would be nice to see her mother again.	Ho ka ba monate ho bona mme wa hae hape.
And he could not last long.	'Me o ne a ke ke a ba le nako e telele.
Eventually, he learned to love them.	Qetellong, o ile a ithuta ho ba rata.
I had no time to think.	Ke ne ke se na nako ea ho nahana.
I need a lot of money.	Ke hloka chelete e ngata.
Yet he wants to have it both.	Leha ho le joalo o batla ho ba le eona ka bobeli.
We liked the same things.	Re ne re rata lintho tse tšoanang.
You will see it.	O tla o bona.
Asking difficult questions.	Ho botsa lipotso tse thata.
He was just like that.	O ne a le joalo feela.
I really liked that he was happy.	Ke ne ke hlile ke rata hore o ne a thabile.
It makes friends here even more real.	E etsa hore metsoalle mona e be ea sebele le ho feta.
Important.	Bohlokoa.
I didn't think it was very good.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore e ntle haholo.
I knew it then.	Ke ne ke e tseba ka nako eo.
To make it an image, think of it this way.	Ho e etsa setšoantšo, e nahane ka tsela ena.
Not many people will like this	Ha se batho ba bangata ba tla rata sena
Last year, it would not have been so.	Selemong se fetileng, ho ka be ho se joalo.
Keep asking questions.	Tsoela pele ho botsa lipotso.
It was very difficult to do that just by walking.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo ho etsa joalo ka ho tsamaea feela.
It will be kind of something.	E tla ba mofuta oa ntho.
I am an adult.	Ke moholo.
He counted his money.	A bala chelete ea hae.
Maybe reading.	Mohlomong ho bala.
However, this method of making it is simple.	Leha ho le joalo, mokhoa ona oa ho o etsa o bonolo.
I can't tell anyone.	Ha ke khone ho bolella mang kapa mang.
From these.	Ho tloha ka tsena.
But that is not my story.	Empa hoo ha se taba ea ka.
After dinner he goes to bed.	Ka mor'a lijo tsa mantsiboea o ea robala.
They all help us.	Ba re thusa kaofela.
Save your home.	Boloka ntlo ea hau.
There was no point in returning home.	Ho ne ho se na thuso ea ho khutlela hae.
They were real people.	E ne e mpa e le batho ba sebele.
I'm right about this.	Ke hantle ka sena.
But nothing was quite right.	Empa ha ho letho le neng le lekana hantle.
He does not know what has happened to them.	Ha a tsebe se etsahetseng ka bona.
I know there are many.	Kea tseba hore ho na le tse ngata.
It looks suspicious but it goes to work.	E shebahala e belaela empa e ea sebetsa.
Speaking is easier for him than writing.	Ho bua ho bonolo ho eena ho feta ho ngola.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
I write, but this is difficult for me.	Kea ngola, empa sena se thata ho 'na.
He didn't talk much to anyone.	O ne a sa bue haholo le mang kapa mang.
I know where he lived.	Ke tseba moo a neng a dula teng.
No food, no water.	Ha ho lijo, ha ho metsi.
I would never ask anyone to leave it.	Ke ne nke ke ka kopa motho ho e tlohela.
It still has what it needs.	E ntse e na le seo e se hlokang.
No more talking.	Ha ho sa bua.
He is not very big.	Ha a moholo haholo.
He was clearly a very powerful man.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a le matla haholo.
I have a slight headache.	Ke na le ho qala hlooho hanyane.
Of course it is.	Ke 'nete hore ho joalo.
But it does not have to be.	Empa ha ho hlokahale hore ho be joalo.
It does more and more we should not do it.	E etsa le ho feta ha rea ​​​​lokela ho e etsa.
That is why planning is so important.	Ke kahoo ho rera ho leng bohlokoa.
You don't care what my parents think of you.	Ha u tsotelle hore na batsoali ba ka ba nahana eng ka uena.
It should not happen.	Ha ea lokela ho etsahala.
It was time to move on.	E ne e le nako ea ho tsoela pele.
We drove to the party.	Re ile ra khanna ho ea moketeng.
I think he was real too.	Ke nahana hore le eena e ne e le oa sebele.
She wished she had never met the man.	O ne a lakatsa eka a ka be a sa ka a kopana le monna eo.
He fell asleep.	A robala.
It has been so for me.	Ho bile joalo bakeng sa ka.
That did not seem to be an important question.	Eo e ne e sa bonahale e le potso ea bohlokoa.
I thought that was a bad thing.	Ke ne ke nahana hore hoo ke ntho e mpe.
He worked from home.	O ne a sebetsa a le hae.
Keep going your own way, do your own thing.	Tsoela pele ho tsamaea ka tsela ea hau, etsa lintho tsa hau.
Life was hard.	Bophelo bo ne bo le boima haholo.
I did it for a reason.	Ke e entse ka lebaka.
It did that.	E entse seo.
Can you fix that call?	O ka lokisa mohala oo?
She felt so good, she thought.	O ile a ikutloa a le monate haholo, a nahana.
So what is it?	Joale ke eng?
This should not happen.	Sena ha sea lokela ho etsahala.
It was hard to walk.	Ho ne ho le thata ho tsamaea.
It must be mine.	E tlameha ho ba ea ka.
Earn money.	Fumana chelete.
How does solar energy work?	Matla a letsatsi a sebetsa joang?
Because you can't go out with him.	Hobane u ke ke ua tsoa le eena.
Well, maybe he is.	Hantle, mohlomong eena.
I don't care what they talk about.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na ba bua ka eng.
Probably never.	Mohlomong ha ho mohla e kileng ea ba teng.
No other dog will come and do anything good.	Ha ho ntja e 'ngoe e tlang ho tla etsa letho le molemo.
Also, try to sleep well.	Hape leka ho robala hantle.
I would love to, though.	Nka rata leha ho le joalo.
But you have to get it, and soon.	Empa u tlameha ho e fumana, 'me haufinyane.
I want her baby.	Ke batla ngoana oa hae.
You hope they do.	U tšepa hore ba tla etsa joalo.
This is the only one I can think of.	Ena ke eona feela eo nka nahanang ka eona.
I've never had that.	Ha ke eso be le seo.
No one ever looked at them.	Ha ho le ea mong ea kileng a ba sheba.
He was not that kind of person.	E ne e se motho wa mofuta oo.
That would come back, he thought.	Seo se ne se tla khutla, a nahana.
They were almost too late.	Ba ne ba batla ba le morao haholo.
And even if you do not, someone else will.	'Me le haeba u sa etse joalo, motho e mong o tla etsa joalo.
We did not always meet with him.	Ha rea ​​ka ra lula re kopana le eena.
Yes, they are.	E, le bona ba joalo.
I felt very guilty about that today.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke le molato haholo ka seo kajeno.
Hard work, hard play.	Ho sebetsa ka thata, ho bapala ka thata.
We were even more excited to get that.	Re ne re thabetse ho feta ho fumana seo.
It is not hard to see why this is so.	Ha ho thata ho bona hore na ke hobane'ng ha sena se lokela ho ba joalo.
All the news is bad.	Litaba tsohle li mpe.
We were very busy.	Re ne re phathahane haholo.
We cannot do that.	Re ka se etse joalo.
I will be equal to you.	Ke tla lekana le uena.
It is my house.	Ke ntlo ea ka.
Most people here do not find anything.	Batho ba bangata mona ha ba fumane letho.
He noticed that now.	O ile a hlokomela seo ha jwale.
You need to be very careful about that.	U lokela ho hlokomela taba eo haholo.
We know our job.	Re tseba mosebetsi oa rona.
I thought she was a good mother.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke ’mè ea molemo.
But his work is certainly going on.	Empa ka sebele mosebetsi oa hae o ntse o tsoela pele.
I usually do about this time.	Hangata ke etsa hoo e ka bang ka nako ena.
It is time to move on.	Ke nako ea ho tsoela pele.
My teacher is very difficult.	Tichere ea ka e thata haholo.
He was one of us.	E ne e le e mong wa rona.
It's almost empty.	E batla e se na letho.
The school did not know what to do with him.	Sekolo se ne se sa tsebe hore na se etse eng ka eena.
But this is not the case.	Empa sena ha se joalo.
I can't speak.	Ha ke khone ho bua.
But he was gone.	Empa o ne a ile.
I don't know what to do now.	Ke sa tsebe seo ke lokelang ho se etsa hona joale.
I asked a man how long this thing had been going on.	Ke ile ka botsa monna e mong hore na ntho ena e na le nako e kae e etsahala.
I was older for my age.	Ke ne ke le moholo bakeng sa lilemo tsa ka.
He wants to visit you every morning.	O batla ho u etela hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
So far they have not.	Ho fihlela joale ha ba e-so.
And he had found it.	Mme o ne a e fumane.
This issue is complex.	Taba ena e thata.
I find them easy to use.	Ke li fumana li le bonolo ho li sebelisa.
See things and write about it.	Ho bona lintho le ho ngola ka eona.
A long time passed.	Nako e telele ea feta.
It should come in today or tomorrow.	E lokela ho kena kajeno kapa hosane.
But since then.	Empa ho tloha ka nako eo.
That is not just forgetfulness.	Seo hase ho lebala feela.
I would do it.	Ke ne ke tla e etsa.
The years passed quickly.	Lilemo li ile tsa feta kapele.
No name for this issue he could see.	Ha ho lebitso la taba ena leo a neng a ka le bona.
There was no room for one.	Ho ne ho se sebaka sa e mong.
They have no problem.	Ha ba na bothata.
What do we have there?	Re na le eng moo?
It did not work well.	Ha aa ka a sebetsa hantle.
In the beginning, he realized that it was now empty.	Ka ho qala, o ile a hlokomela hore e ne e se e se na letho joale.
But he did not go with him alone.	Empa ha aa ka a tsamaea le eena feela.
If so, it may be that he is to blame.	Haeba ho joalo, ho ka etsahala hore ebe ke eena molato.
However, it did have its moments.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e e-na le linako tsa eona.
I was both.	Ke ne ke le bobeli.
Once here, you will enjoy a delicious meal.	Ha u le mona, u tla thabela lijo tse monate.
He seemed hopeless.	O ne a bonahala a se na monyetla.
I stood firm.	Ke ile ka ema ka thata.
You no longer feel long.	Ha u sa ikutloa u le nako e telele.
It is important.	E bohlokoa.
We are very happy with it.	Re monate haholo ka eona.
This should happen soon during this time.	Sena se lokela ho etsahala kapele nakong ena.
And this is good.	Hape sena se hantle.
We feel alone.	Re ikutloa re le bang.
I did a few things.	Ke entse lintho tse ’maloa.
I say this here and now.	Ke bolela sena mona le jwale.
That is not the case here.	Taba eo ha se eona taba mona.
Probably not his fault.	Mohlomong hase molato oa hae.
Maybe I'm doing it right now.	Mohlomong ke ntse ke etsa joalo hona joale.
Yet the best team no one has ever heard of.	Leha ho le joalo sehlopha se setle ka ho fetisisa ha ho motho ea kileng a utloa ka sona.
This is often the case.	Hangata sena ke sona se etsahalang.
People are good there.	Batho ba na le molemo moo.
Not so for me.	Haho joalo ho nna.
Such things are dangerous for children.	Lintho tse joalo li kotsi ho bana.
We became very good friends.	Re ile ra ba metsoalle e molemo haholo.
It is truly our strength.	Ke matla a rona ruri.
But this is us.	Empa sena ke rona.
That is a fact.	Ke eona 'nete.
But he understood that it meant money.	Empa o ne a utloisisa hore ho bolela chelete.
From time to time, will you come to me.	Ho tloha nako le nako, na u tla tla ho 'na.
He said we had never met.	O itse ha re eso kopane.
But it is our life.	Empa ke bophelo ba rona.
I have a difficult question.	Ke na le potso e thata.
He continued with the work.	O ile a tsoela pele ka mosebetsi.
It was not a good thing.	E ne e se ntho e ntle.
If you want to talk to me, talk to me.	Ha o batla ho bua le nna, bua le nna.
That goes for his job.	Seo se ea bakeng sa mosebetsi oa hae.
It may be several days.	E ka ba matsatsi a 'maloa.
It was his money.	E ne e le chelete ea hae.
I need to understand more.	Ke hloka ho utloisisa haholoanyane.
I know it's something.	Kea tseba hore ke ntho e itseng.
He saw us but kept going.	O ile a re bona empa a ’na a tsoela pele.
He asked if he had made a mistake.	O ile a botsa hore na o entse phoso.
Help with.	Thuso ka.
There are so many things to love here!	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tseo u ka li ratang mona!
That's why.	Ke ka lebaka leo.
We will be there to take care of you.	Re tla ba teng ho u hlokomela.
He saw that.	O bone seo.
Time was running out.	Nako e ne e se e sa tsamaee hantle.
Yet no one came for them.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho motho ea ileng a tla bakeng sa bona.
I think we had it.	Ke nahana hore re bile le eona.
But this will not happen.	Empa sena se ke ke sa etsahala.
One of them was a man.	E mong oa bona e ne e le motho.
It is not their place.	Ha se sebaka sa bona.
We learn a lot of them every day.	Re ithuta tse ngata tsa tsona letsatsi le letsatsi.
You need to want to do it for hours and hours.	U hloka ho batla ho e etsa lihora le lihora.
It has to do better.	E tlameha ho etsa betere.
However, he has an opinion.	Leha ho le joalo, o na le maikutlo.
We spend most of our lives.	Re nka nako tse ngata tsa bophelo.
This is the second time you have come back this week.	Ke lekhetlo la bobeli u fihla morao bekeng ena.
I want to sing.	Ke batla ho bina.
We are just.	Re feela.
This car has seen better days.	Koloi ena e bone matsatsi a betere.
But there was no time.	Empa ho ne ho se nako.
You must do this carefully.	U tlameha ho etsa sena ka hloko.
Except for the girl.	Ntle le ngoanana.
It wasn't too much.	E ne e se ngata haholo.
It seemed fun.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ke monate.
I would look at it all.	Ke ne ke tla e sheba kaofela.
No news from this morning.	Ha ho litaba ho tloha hoseng hona.
I can't afford this.	Ha ke khone ho reka sena.
I would hear it.	Ke ne ke tla e utloa.
Once he arrives, he will start work.	Hang ha a fihla, o tla qala mosebetsi.
Sometimes for a long time.	Ka linako tse ling ka nako e telele.
I know this, but it was really not the reason.	Ke tseba sena, empa e ne e hlile e se lebaka.
It has to be just one thing.	E tlameha ho ba ntho e le 'ngoe feela.
The past was not my business.	Nako e fetileng e ne e se taba ea ka.
Probably, never.	Mohlomong, le ka mohla.
If you really have such feelings, eat before you leave.	Haeba u hlile u na le maikutlo a joalo, ja pele u tsamaea.
They wanted to do anything for them.	Ba ne ba rata ho ba etsetsa ntho leha e le efe.
So we don't think about it.	Ka hona ha re e nahane.
Maybe I'm not a real person.	Mohlomong ha ke motho oa sebele.
Of course he did not know.	Ehlile o ne a sa tsebe.
Then he will not be able to sleep.	Joale ha a sa tla robala.
Do you have time?	O na le nako?
He won't have to do that.	A ke ke a tlameha ho etsa jwalo.
So we will help him.	Kahoo re tla mo thusa.
I was happy.	Ke ne ke thabile.
That was obvious.	Seo se ne se hlakile.
You pass a very dangerous place.	O feta sebakeng se kotsi haholo.
had no problems using it.	e ne e se na mathata a ho e sebelisa.
You love them.	U li rata.
She cried, but she did not say anything.	O ile a lla, empa ha aa ka a bua letho.
And that meant everyone.	Mme hoo ho ne ho bolela bohle.
So that's all about it.	Kahoo ke tsohle ka eona.
He wanted it.	O ne a e batla.
He agreed, and they both drove away.	O ile a lumela, eaba bobeli ba bona ba tsamaea ka koloi.
We have found many similarities.	Re fumane lintho tse ngata tse tšoanang.
People wanted to see this place.	Batho ba ne ba batla ho tla bona sebaka sena.
I should not have said anything to my wife.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho bua letho ho mosali oa ka.
Just forget that.	Lebala seo feela.
I must have seen one or both of them before.	E tlameha ebe ke bone a le mong kapa bobeli ba bona pele.
I would pay you, you know.	Ke ne ke tla u lefa, ua tseba.
No one noticed her.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo hlokomela.
Everyone else just enjoys reading.	Ba bang kaofela ba thabela ho bala feela.
But then he did.	Empa joale o ile a etsa joalo.
Make no mistake about it, this is a very serious matter.	U se ke ua etsa phoso, sena ke lintho tse matla.
Which made us think that maybe we should talk to them more.	E leng se ileng sa etsa hore re nahane hore mohlomong re lokela ho bua le bona haholoanyane.
Now he did not know what to think.	Joale o ne a sa tsebe hore na a nahane eng.
I have never wanted children.	Ha ke eso batle bana.
There was something wrong.	Ho ne ho ena le phoso.
He still doesn't.	O ntse a sa etse jwalo.
Make my job easier for me.	Etsa hore mosebetsi oa ka o be bonolo ho 'na.
He did not help.	Ha a ka a thusa.
Of course you can do this on the go.	Ehlile u ka etsa sena ha u ntse u tsamaea.
I want him.	Kea mo batla.
I hope you too will benefit.	Ke tšepa hore le uena u tla u tsoela molemo.
I talk to her every week.	Ke bua le eena beke le beke.
I like working with other people.	Ke rata ho sebetsa le batho ba bang.
I never found them again.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke li fumana.
Not telling the truth is an easy way out.	Ho se bue 'nete ke tsela e bonolo ea ho tsoa.
There was always that opportunity.	Ho ne ho lula ho e-na le monyetla oo.
You will have to come and give one suggestion.	U tla tlameha ho tla ho fana ka tlhahiso e le 'ngoe.
Otherwise, it will not help him at all.	Ntle ho moo, ho ke ke ha mo thusa ka letho.
Love someone you know.	Rata le motho eo u mo tsebang.
Writing feels like that sometimes.	Ho ngola ho ikutloa joalo ka linako tse ling.
I will enjoy that.	Ke tla thabela seo.
I can't do that.	Ha ke khone ho etsa joalo.
It was her husband.	E ne e le monna wa hae.
I already love him.	Ke se ke ntse ke mo rata.
But that is just my opinion.	Empa eo ke maikutlo a ka feela.
Or just talking.	Kapa ho bua feela.
That's where you are with him.	Ke moo u nang le eena.
But it also will not help.	Empa hape e ke ke ea thusa letho.
Every house should have one.	Ntlo e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e lokela ho ba le eona.
That's how you need to know.	Ke ka moo o hlokang ho tseba.
Do not speak.	Se bue.
I'm sorry if my opinion seems to suggest that.	Ke masoabi haeba maikutlo a ka a bonahala a fana ka maikutlo a joalo.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
It's just, we don't know how.	Ke feela, ha re tsebe hore na joang.
She probably knew that her son was not the type of person she was.	Mohlomong o ne a tseba hore mora oa hae e ne e se motho oa mofuta oo.
We could go for everything.	Re ne re ka tsamaea ho tsohle.
The clothes were very nice.	Liaparo li ne li le ntle haholo.
It should not have been at this time.	E ne e sa lokela ho ba nakong ena.
They are still there.	Ba ntse ba le teng.
I know so much about you.	Ke tseba lintho tse ngata haholo ka uena.
Yes, he did.	E, o ile a re.
Or their friends did.	Kapa metsoalle ea bona e ile ea etsa joalo.
He will live.	O tla phela.
We've found a way to win, and that's what's important.	Re fumane mokhoa oa ho hlola, 'me ke sona seo e leng sa bohlokoa.
We can try.	Re ka leka.
Never tell anyone anything you did not have to do.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua bolella mang kapa mang ntho leha e le efe eo u neng u sa tlameha ho e etsa.
However, it is just my opinion.	Leha ho le joalo, ke maikutlo a ka feela.
I do not think so.	Ha ke nahane.
I have it all in here.	Ke na le tsohle ka mona.
However I could not.	Leha ho le joalo ke ne ke sa khone.
Or maybe it was his.	Kapa mohlomong e ne e le ea hae.
None of the children worked.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bana ea neng a sebetsa.
Everyone says they are very fun.	E mong le e mong o re ba monate haholo.
Today is a wonderful day.	Kajeno ke letsatsi le monate.
You were a very good team.	U ne u le sehlopha se setle haholo.
I really don't understand it.	Ke hlile ha ke e utloisise.
But it was something in its own way, perhaps, powerful.	Empa e ne e le ntho e itseng ka tsela ea eona, mohlomong, e matla.
Your chance to catch it was here.	Monyetla oa hau oa ho e tšoara o ne o le mona.
He helped her find the room she was looking for.	O ile a mo thusa ho fumana kamore eo a neng a e batla.
The fact is.	'Nete ke hore .
Well just think of that.	Hantle feela nahana seo.
It feels very fast.	E ikutloa kapele haholo.
He forgot the pain.	A lebala bohloko.
They have no time to speak.	Ha ba na nako ea ho bua.
Love, love, love.	Rata, rata, rata.
And if you want to be.	'Me haeba u batla ho ba.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na.
Find out where he was.	Tseba moo a neng a le teng.
They walk hand in hand.	Ba tsamaea ka matsoho le matsoho.
He did not do any of those things.	Ha aa ka a etsa letho la lintho tseo.
Well, this is what happened.	Ha e le hantle, sena ke se ileng sa etsahala.
It didn’t really matter.	Ho ne ho se taba hakaalo.
He likes the same things you do.	O rata lintho tse tšoanang le tseo u li ratang.
I like it there.	Kea e rata moo.
Their children did not live long.	Bana ba bona ha baa ka ba phela nako e telele.
But if he can.	Empa haeba a ka khona.
I have to say.	Ke lokela ho bolela.
We still have a way to go.	Re ntse re na le tsela eo re lokelang ho tsamaea ka eona.
I need water several times a day.	Ke hloka metsi hangata ka letsatsi.
He would have to talk to her about it.	O ne a tla tlameha ho bua le eena ka eona.
Probably more than a few.	Mohlomong ho feta tse 'maloa.
When it does, then.	Ha e etsahala, ebe.
They can't say they know.	Ba ke ke ba re ba a tseba.
Both of these are very powerful.	Tsena ka bobeli li matla haholo.
How can this be.	See se ka etsahala joang.
A man spoke to me.	Monna e mong o ile a bua le nna.
I knew him for years before we met.	Ke ile ka mo tseba ka lilemo tse ngata pele re kopana.
That's what you want.	Ke seo u se batlang.
Of course, they have not said anything.	Ehlile, ha ba eso bue letho.
This is another issue that we had.	Ena ke taba e ‘ngoe eo re neng re e-na le eona.
He often had dinner with his family.	Hangata o ne a ja lijo tsa mantsiboea le lelapa la hae.
It was a school team.	E ne e le sehlopha sa sekolo.
So he went in search of water.	Kahoo, a ya batla metsi.
He was in a better position.	O ne a le sebakeng se betere.
Any help would be helpful.	Thuso leha e le efe e ka ba molemo.
Their books.	Libuka tsa tsona.
One after another.	E 'ngoe ka mor'a e 'ngoe.
I don't care how.	ha ke tsotelle kamoo.
If this is what you want, fine.	Haeba sena ke seo u se batlang, se setle.
But the pain was second to none.	Empa bohloko e ne e le ba bobeli.
They are yours.	Ke tsa hao.
Do not miss the opportunity to try it.	U se ke ua feta monyetla oa ho e leka.
They can have it.	Ba ka ba le eona.
Some may come.	Ba bang ba ka tla.
He had his family.	O ne a e-na le lelapa la hae.
We would love to see them!	Re ka thabela ho ba bona!
He tried desperately to think of something else.	O ile a leka ka matla ho nahana ka ntho e ’ngoe hape.
I think your last comment is very important.	Ke nahana hore maikutlo a hau a ho qetela ke a bohlokoa haholo.
And we are not.	'Me ha re joalo.
I buy again.	Kea reka hape.
But he did nothing.	Empa ha a ka a etsa letho.
Keep asking questions !!.	Tsoela pele ho botsa lipotso !!.
We do things that we can only do.	Re etsa lintho tseo re ka li etsang feela.
My father seemed very busy for me.	Ntate o ne a bonahala a phathahane haholo bakeng sa ka.
But we are close.	Empa re haufi.
It was real.	E ne e le ntho ea sebele.
Finally he was done.	Qetellong o ne a qetile.
I just need to talk to you.	Ke hloka feela ho bua le uena.
Just a moment please.	Ema hanyane ka kopo.
This works well.	Sena se sebetsa hantle.
He wanted to go.	O ne a batla ho tsamaea.
Children are having a hard time right now.	Bana ba na le nako e thata hona joale.
The children were crying.	Bana ba ne ba lla.
Probably nothing.	Mohlomong ha ho letho.
We will not give away all who come.	Re ke ke ra fana ka bohle ba tlang.
That's where we came from.	Ke sebaka seo re ileng ra fihla ho sona.
I enjoy doing this work.	Ke thabetse ho etsa mosebetsi ona.
I had to do very difficult things.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho etsa lintho tse thata haholo.
We had to think it through.	Re ne re tlameha ho e nahana hantle.
Will you help?	O tla thusa?
This was not what he was talking about.	Ena e ne e se ntho eo a neng a bua ka eona.
But some do not.	Empa ba bang ha ba etse joalo.
It needs fun in it.	E hloka monate ho eona.
Some have only seen power.	Ba bang ba kile ba bona matla feela.
I did not see that coming.	Ke ne ke sa bone seo se tla.
No, they are not.	Che, ha ba joalo.
She does a great job !.	O etsa mosebetsi o motle!.
I knew exactly what had happened, though.	Ke ne ke tseba hantle se etsahetseng, leha ho le joalo.
I can find out about that.	Nka fumana ka seo.
I could feel it.	Ke ne ke utloa.
Do the latter, before you do the first.	Etsa tsa morao, pele u etsa tsa pele.
I need to get home.	Ke hloka ho fihla hae.
But you do not have to do this if you do not want to.	Empa ha ho hlokahale hore u etse joalo ha u sa batle.
They wanted to leave, but they had no money.	Ba ne ba batla ho tsamaea, empa ba ne ba se na chelete.
They were done.	Ba ne ba qetile.
It was that easy.	Ho ne ho le bonolo joalo.
We are looking for him there, and we think it will be fun.	Re mo batla teng, mme re nahana hore ho tla ba monate.
You know enough about your current strength.	U tseba ho lekaneng bakeng sa matla a hau a hona joale.
And you probably do not do well at all.	Mme mohlomong ha o etse hantle ho seo.
And you see this.	Mme sena o se bona.
They went to the police.	Ba ile ba ea mapolesa.
Of course, those were very important.	Ehlile, tseo e ne e le tsa bohlokoa ruri.
This could be his life.	Sena e ka ba bophelo ba hae.
We live by it.	Re phela ka eona.
I tried to find out what happened.	Ke ile ka leka ho fumana se etsahetseng.
Look at it.	Sheba ke.
They will be there soon.	Li tla ba teng haufinyane.
Now my question is.	Joale potso ea ka ke hore.
That should never happen.	Seo ha sea lokela ho etsahala le ka mohla.
He needed her very much.	O ne a mo hloka haholo.
Eventually, he “learned to walk again”.	Qetellong, "o ile a ithuta ho tsamaea hape".
It was everything my mother wanted.	E ne e le ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe eo ’Mè a neng a e batla.
There is a kind of situation.	Ho na le mofuta oa boemo.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore ho ne ho se joalo.
It was enough money to buy a new car.	E ne e le chelete e lekaneng ho reka koloi e ncha.
We wish we could have continued working together.	Re lakatsa eka re ka be re ile ra tsoela pele ho sebetsa hammoho.
I really enjoy reading your comments.	Ke thabela ho bala maikutlo a hau haholo.
What was more, they knew nothing.	Se neng se feta moo, ba ne ba sa tsebe letho.
Pay in advance.	Lefa esale pele.
You can read about this here.	U ka bala ka sena mona.
I hope you have a great week.	Kea tšepa u na le beke e ntle.
They certainly seemed to know him.	Ka sebele ho ne ho bonahala ba mo tseba.
Let’s face it, you can’t go alone.	A re ee, u ke ke ua tsamaea u le mong.
We are waiting.	Re emetse.
Because they have no one, see.	Hobane ha ba na motho, le a bona.
This work requires a lot of money.	Mosebetsi ona o hloka chelete e ngata.
I can't let you go.	Ha ke khone ho u tlohela.
And it was no surprise.	'Me e ne e se ntho e makatsang.
We could not understand why.	Re ne re ke ke ra utloisisa lebaka.
Once, once, we stayed at home.	Ka lekhetlo le leng, hang, re ile ra lula hae.
Someone heard it, or did not hear it.	E mong o utloile, kapa ha a ka a e utloa.
Mistake could never do it again.	Phoso o ne a ke ke a hlola a e etsa hape.
You must start your own group before you can use it.	U tlameha ho qala sehlopha sa hau pele u se sebelisa.
It was time to see his family and friends.	E ne e le nako ea ho bona lelapa la hae le metsoalle.
He saw more of me than anyone else.	O ne a bona ka nna ho feta mang kapa mang.
And maybe there, we'll get another chance.	Mme mohlomong moo, re tla fumana monyetla o mong.
It was difficult to do so.	Ho ne ho le thata ho etsa joalo.
He could not have done better than that.	O ne a ka se khone ho etsa betere ho feta moo.
Or my work anywhere, really.	Kapa mosebetsi oa ka kae kapa kae, ka 'nete.
For the fourth time he will finish the job.	Ka sebele lekhetlo la bone o tla qeta mosebetsi.
You will stay here.	U tla lula mona.
His people were looking forward to his return.	Batho ba hae ba ne ba lebeletse ho khutla ha hae.
You do not have to keep them.	Ha ua tlameha ho li boloka.
There really is something for everyone.	Ho hlile ho na le ho hong bakeng sa motho e mong le e mong.
That was obvious.	Seo se ne se hlakile.
We could not find him anywhere.	Ha rea ​​ka ra mo fumana kae kapa kae.
I give him money every day.	Ke mo fa chelete letsatsi le letsatsi.
He did not say anything for a long time.	Ha aa ka a bua letho ka nako e telele.
I’ll give you one chance, though.	Ke tla u fa monyetla o le mong, leha ho le joalo.
When you arrive.	Ha u fihla.
Tonight we did the fourth.	Bosiung bona re entse ea bone.
He started calling her but decided to refuse.	O ile a qala ho mo letsetsa empa a etsa qeto ea ho hana.
That was a great man.	Eo e ne e le monna e moholo.
This would not be easy.	Sena se ne se ke ke sa ba bonolo.
What would he do with it?	O ne a tla etsa joang ka eona?
He was sure he was there.	O ne a na le bonnete ba hore o ne a le teng.
I felt strong, though not emotionally.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke le matla, le hoja e se ka maikutlo a itseng.
Somehow the man was behind her.	Ka tsela e itseng monna o ne a le ka mor’a hae.
You can move on.	U ka tsoela pele.
That they are very important.	Ke hore ba bohlokoa haholo.
I know it's hard.	Kea tseba hore ho thata.
Well with people.	Hantle le batho.
That night, however, something wonderful happened.	Leha ho le joalo, bosiung boo, ho ile ha etsahala ntho e ntle haholo.
I can't get out tonight, maybe suggesting get out tomorrow.	Ha ke khone ho tsoa bosiung bona, mohlomong ho fana ka tlhahiso ea ho tsoa hosane.
There is only one of you.	Ho na le a le mong feela wa lona.
He took every opportunity to get the good from the bad.	O nkile monyetla o mong le o mong ho fumana tse ntle ho tse joalo tse mpe.
I have no time.	Ha ke na nako.
Although my closest friends have it.	Le hoja metsoalle ea ka e haufi e na le eona.
Then try another approach.	Ebe o leka mokhoa o mong.
Everyone there thought it was a good idea.	Bohle ba neng ba le moo ba ne ba nahana hore ke mohopolo o motle.
I looked for him while he was still alive.	Ke ile ka mo batla a ntse a phela.
Are you saying that he made you.	Na u bolela hore ke eena ea u entseng.
I did not work accidentally.	Ha kea sebetsa kotsi.
Nobody can do that.	Haho motho ya ka etsang seo.
He is always there.	O dula a le teng.
He seemed to be talking more than anyone there.	Ho ne ho bonahala a bua a le mong ho feta leha e le mang moo.
I hope you enjoy the book.	Ke tšepa hore u tla thabela buka.
Driving car.	Koloi ea ho khanna.
But we can do this only if we know how.	Empa re ka etsa sena ha feela re tseba.
We had them there yesterday.	Re bile le tsona moo maobane.
Not sure where to look after a problem.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na u ka sheba hokae ka mor'a bothata.
Instead, it takes advantage of his time here.	Ho e-na le hoo, ho nka monyetla ka nako ea hae mona.
The road is clear.	Tsela e hlakile.
But that did not happen.	Empa ha hoa ka ha etsahala ntho e joalo.
Of course, he could not have seen anything.	Ehlile, ho ne ho ka etsahala hore o ne a eso bone letho.
From infancy he learned to read and write.	Ha e sa le ngoana o ile a ithuta ho bala le ho ngola.
Because this is passing quickly.	Hobane sena se feta kapele.
He started talking to his mother instead of her.	O ile a qala ho bua le ’mè oa hae ho e-na le eena.
But it is one of them that you love.	Empa ke e 'ngoe ea tsona eo u e ratang.
I've never seen it.	Ha ke eso e bone.
Read more about her clothes.	Bala haholoanyane ka liaparo tsa hae.
Of course I will keep this up.	Ehlile ke tla boloka sena se le teng.
However, he said something else that day.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a bua ntho e 'ngoe ka letsatsi leo.
But it wasn't, was it, it wasn't.	Empa ho ne ho se jwalo, na ho ne ho le jwalo, ho ne ho se jwalo.
It can be weird.	E ka ba ntho e makatsang.
And you know it when you get it.	'Me u e tseba ha u e fumana.
That doesn't make him more aware.	Seo ha se etse hore a se tsebe ho feta.
You told us.	U re boleletse.
It was not as easy as one might think.	Ho ne ho se bonolo hakaalo kamoo motho a ka nahanang kateng.
I never found him again.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke mo fumana hape.
But I did not know him well.	Empa ke ne ke sa mo tsebe hantle.
It looked so good.	E ne e shebahala e le ntle hakaalo.
She looked at him hard.	A mo sheba ka thata.
No one else was there, just.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong ea neng a le teng, feela.
Yes, you should.	E, o lokela.
Further he says.	Ho feta moo o re.
Then he sits down.	Ebe o dula.
However, it is more difficult than ever.	Leha ho le joalo, ho thata ho feta ho feta.
He wanted her.	O ne a mo batla.
Give your child a better life and all that.	Fana ka ngoana bophelo bo betere le tseo tsohle.
We had.	Re ne re na le.
He put it on and hoped it would help.	O ile a e apara 'me a tšepa hore e tla thusa.
So it is very difficult.	Kahoo ho thata haholo.
We do not know whether he will live.	Ha re tsebe hore na o tla phela.
Our children are good children.	Bana ba rona ke bana ba molemo.
Or I would say the last four years ago.	Kapa ke re ea ho qetela lilemo tse 'ne tse fetileng.
Good thing here.	Ntho e ntle mona.
Surprisingly, it took so long.	Ntho e makatsang ke hore ho nkile nako e telele hakana.
Mental state.	Boemo ba kelello.
They can't have a group.	Ba ke ke ba ba le sehlopha.
I can't understand it.	Ha ke khone ho e utloisisa.
Then something amazing happened.	Joale ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang.
House, place, way of life.	Ntlo, sebaka, tsela ea bophelo.
Obviously, this issue is not new.	Ho hlakile hore taba ena ha e ncha.
So my question here.	Ka hona potso ea ka mona.
More books than they ever had at school.	Libuka tse ngata ho feta tseo ba kileng ba ba le tsona sekolong.
People look outside, looking back.	Batho ba sheba ka ntle, ba sheba ka morao.
I have to find a way to tell him what is happening.	Ke tlameha ho fumana mokhoa oa ho mo bolella se etsahalang.
Strong enough to help him.	Ea matla ho lekana ho mo thusa.
And he did nothing.	Hape ha aa ka a etsa letho.
But no one is there.	Empa haho motho moo.
I'm the only one here.	Ke 'na feela mona.
You can come back.	U ka khutla.
They were just children.	E ne e le bana feela.
Hear the truth from someone he trusted.	Utloa 'nete ho motho eo a neng a mo tšepa.
I really would rather not do that.	Ke hlile nka mpa ka se ke ka etsa joalo.
I loved people.	Ke ne ke rata batho.
I know you have it.	Kea tseba hore o na le eona.
Start reading here.	Qala ho bala mona.
This picture, however, is too good to be true.	Setšoantšo sena, leha ho le joalo, se setle haholo hore e ka ba 'nete.
There were three.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse tharo.
He spoke to her.	A bua le eena .
With it all are equal.	Ka eona bohle baa lekana.
However, mine did.	Leha ho le joalo, ea ka e entse joalo.
Look at Dad.	Sheba Ntate.
I'm a little tired.	Ke khathetse hanyane.
That will take you, so far.	Seo se tla o nka, ho fihlela joale.
I could not find a way.	Ke ne ke sa bone tsela.
You must have heard.	E tlameha ebe u utloile.
Otherwise he would not have done so.	Ho seng joalo o ne a ke ke a etsa joalo.
Each of us learned things from the other, and through us.	E mong le e mong oa rōna o ile a ithuta lintho ka e mong, le ka rōna.
Me too.	Le 'na.
I feel like crying.	Ke ikutloa eka ke lla.
This is a very good thing.	Ena ke ntho e ntle haholo.
My son is strong.	Mora oa ka o matla.
That, in a way, he was.	Seo, ka tsela e itseng, a neng a le sona.
I have only one question.	Ke na le potso e le 'ngoe feela.
He just stared.	A sheba feela.
I asked what it was.	Ke ile ka botsa hore na ke eng.
I had never seen anything like it.	Ke ne ke e-s'o bone letho le joalo.
If he were not there, she would not come to find him.	Haeba a ne a le sieo, o ne a ke ke a tla ho mo fumana.
So maybe it was my fault.	Kahoo mohlomong e ne e le molato oa ka.
You will see that.	O tla bona seo.
How much time does he spend studying?	O na le nako e kae a ithuta?
Look at the picture.	Sheba setšoantšo.
Last week was tough.	Beke e fetileng e ne e le boima.
But it is not enough.	Empa ha hoa lekana.
I thought we were going to go.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re tla ea.
But it is much better.	Empa ho molemo haholo.
I never learned it in school.	Ha kea e ithuta sekolong.
Try to leave the room as soon as you can.	Leka ho tsoa ka phaposing kapele kamoo u ka khonang.
Then we do something else.	Ebe re etsa ntho e 'ngoe hape.
And so it was with this.	Mme ho bile jwalo le ka sena.
I don't know if that is the case.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ho joalo.
It is easier said than done.	Ho bonolo ho e bua ho feta ho e etsa.
As I study.	Ha ke ntse ke ithuta.
I can't do that.	Ha ke khone ho etsa joalo.
We did that well.	Re entse seo hantle.
They were very fun.	Ba ne ba le monate haholo.
He was already thinking.	O ne a se a ntse a nahana.
Maybe it was both.	Mohlomong e ne e le bobeli.
It touches even more emotionally.	E tšoara maikutlo le ho feta.
He may not like that.	A ka nna a se rate seo.
We realized that we both love the same thing.	Re ile ra hlokomela hore ka bobeli re rata ntho e le ’ngoe.
And you can sing too.	Mme le wena o ka bina.
He took my husband.	O nkile monna oa ka.
It's hard to read every day.	Ho thata ho bala ka letsatsi le letsatsi.
Or he should have known.	Kapa o ne a lokela ho tseba.
Where are they going?	Ba ea hokae?
We have a problem of some kind.	Re na le bothata ba mofuta o mong.
He was always very grateful.	O ne a leboha haholo ka linako tsohle.
It was now.	E ne e le jwale.
Spending time with you.	Ho qeta nako le uena.
She was the only woman he ever wanted.	E ne e le eena feela mosali eo a neng a mo batla.
If you want to go, go now.	Haeba u batla ho tsamaea, tsamaea hona joale.
There would be no fall in one way or another.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba le ho oa ka tsela e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe.
They called the local police.	Ba ile ba letsetsa mapolesa a moo.
He started immediately.	A qala hang.
It's us, of course.	Ke rona, ruri.
She loved him.	E ne e mo rata.
I will sleep better.	Ke tla robala betere.
It's in it too.	Ke ho eona hape.
I'll call you on what's going on.	Ke tla o letsetsa ka se etsahalang.
Of course, everyone wants to be a doctor.	Ke ’nete hore e mong le e mong o batla ho ba ngaka.
I want you very much.	Ke o batla haholo.
This is not necessarily true.	Sena ha se hakaalo hore ke 'nete.
He did not know exactly where the place was.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na sebaka seo se hokae.
You are not thinking well.	Ha o nahane hantle.
He found nothing.	O ne a sa fumana letho.
The girl does not know his feelings.	Ngoanana ha a tsebe maikutlo a hae.
However, the problem persists.	Leha ho le joalo, bothata bo ntse bo tsoela pele.
In fact, he did not really care.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a sa tsotelle letho.
That was what he expected.	Seo o ne a se lebeletse.
I'm not sure where to look.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka sheba hokae.
He did not know many things.	O ne a sa tsebe lintho tse ngata.
It seemed too much.	E ne e bonahala e le ngata haholo.
Or how they think they want to do it.	Kapa kamoo ba nahanang hore ba batla ho etsa joalo.
Make sure you have enough food.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u na le lijo tse lekaneng.
Better, not worse.	Ho betere, ho se be betere.
But the first one.	Empa e 'ngoe ea pele.
They almost had nothing to do.	Ba ne ba batla ba se na letho leo ba ka le etsang.
His friends would be home now.	Metsoalle ea hae e ne e tla be e le hae hona joale.
He prepared food for the party.	O ile a lokisa lijo bakeng sa mokete.
I can take her.	Nka mo nka.
They are tough but good for kids.	Li thata empa li ntle bakeng sa bana.
Second time a week.	Lekhetlo la bobeli ka beke.
The coffee was very strong.	Kofi e ne e le matla haholo.
And things were not going well.	'Me lintho li ne li sa tsamaee hantle.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
I don't think we can do it.	Ha ke nahane hore re ka e khona.
He wanted to get out of here.	O ne a batla ho tsoa mona.
So he is somewhere else.	Kahoo o sebakeng se seng.
It's right behind you.	Ke ka mora hao hantle.
They will do whatever they want.	Ba tla etsa eng kapa eng eo ba e hlokang.
He may, or may not.	A ka, kapa a se ke a.
There was nothing more I could say.	Ho ne ho se ho se seo nka se buang.
It was like a house.	E ne eka ke ntlo.
He talked to her and us from it.	O ile a bua le eena le rona ho tsoa ho eona.
The first is a man.	Wa pele ke monna.
It's not very good.	Ha e ntle haholo.
He is arrested.	Oa tšoaroa.
He wanted to work harder.	O ne a batla ho sebetsa ho feta moo.
Everything has a type.	Lintho tsohle li na le mofuta.
It can be important.	E ka ba ea bohlokoa.
They left that morning.	Ba tloha hoseng hoo.
After this it was very easy to fix things.	Ka mor'a sena ho ne ho le bonolo haholo ho lokisa lintho.
But it does not seem to work.	Empa ha e bonahale e sebetsa.
I'm done with it.	Ke qetile ka eona.
They just do their job and do it well.	Ba mpa ba etsa mosebetsi oa bona mme ba o etsa hantle.
I asked him if I was going home.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na ke ea hae.
It was hard work but fun.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima empa o monate.
He didn't care.	O ne a sa tsotelle.
He will delight anyone.	O tla thabela mang kapa mang.
Being close to people.	Ho ba haufi le batho.
Therefore, no one has them.	Ka hona, ha ho motho ea nang le tsona.
Just a few more questions.	Lipotso tse ling tse seng kae feela.
They don't know what's going on.	Ha ba tsebe se etsahalang.
We must use common sense here.	Re tlameha ho sebelisa kelello mona.
There is a simple reason for this.	Ho na le lebaka le bonolo la sena.
Now here was a very nice kid, probably high school years.	Joale mona e ne e le ngoana ea motle haholo, mohlomong lilemo tsa ho kena sekolo se phahameng.
I hope you will too.	Ke tšepa le uena u tla etsa joalo.
It is their starting point.	Ke boemo ba bona ba ho qala.
It was clear there was something wrong with him.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso ka eena.
Also, food was not enough.	Hape, lijo li ne li sa lekana.
Probably by conviction.	Mohlomong ka ho kholisa.
Kena !.	Kena!.
I wanted to watch what you were doing.	Ke ne ke batla ho shebella seo u se etsang.
They don't see it.	Ha ba e bone.
Keep reading to see how you can buy it.	Tsoela pele ho bala ho bona hore na u ka e reka joang.
He will be glad to have you.	O tla thabela ho ba le uena.
See what they think of me now.	Bona seo ba se nahanang ka nna jwale.
So even if you wanted to do it, you could not.	Kahoo le haeba u ne u batla ho e etsa, u ne u sa khone.
Well, it's there.	Be, e teng moo.
Another girl entered the room.	Ngoanana e mong o ile a kena ka kamoreng.
Try not to sit back and think about things.	Leka hore u se ke ua lula fatše 'me ua nahana ka lintho.
There is a way to work on that.	Ho na le mokhoa oa ho sebetsa ho seo.
This is the same feeling.	Ena ke maikutlo a tšoanang.
But that's not what I like.	Empa ha se seo ke se ratang.
It's not as hard as it looks.	Ha e thata joalo ka ha e shebahala.
I will never tell you again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke le bolella.
We will come for you.	Re tla tla bakeng sa hao.
That's when he realized he was gone.	Ke moo a ileng a hlokomela hore o ile.
Lots of things the team needed to hear.	Lintho tse ngata tseo sehlopha se neng se hloka ho li utloa.
How would that happen.	Seo se ne se tla etsahala joang.
You must feel that way.	U tlameha ho ikutloa joalo.
Yes, here it is.	E, ke ena.
These are what they always were.	Tsena ke seo ba neng ba le sona kamehla.
He rode his bicycle to work.	O ne a palama baesekele ea hae ho ea mosebetsing.
It was his.	E ne e le ea hae.
Tell me anything important you have.	Bolella ntho leha e le efe ea bohlokoa eo u nang le eona.
That's when she cried.	Ke moo a ileng a lla.
The boy wanted to ask more questions.	Moshanyana eo o ne a batla ho botsa lipotso tse ngata.
It's just kind of.	Ke mofuta feela.
There was no way they could do it.	Ho ne ho se kamoo ba neng ba ka khona ho e etsa.
I have to sleep.	Ke tlameha ho robala.
That is why it is so important.	Ke ka hona e leng bohlokoa.
Friends and family passed by.	Metsoalle le ba lelapa ba ne ba feta.
Or it likes.	Kapa e rata.
However, it was too late.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se e le morao haholo.
So, without further ado, it's time for your drinking!	Kahoo, ntle le ho feta, nako ea ho noa ha hao!
It was a wonderful time.	E ne e le nako e monate.
You can no longer do this.	U ke ke ua hlola u etsa sena.
All of this works very well.	Sena sohle se sebetsa hantle haholo.
Then they will be able to see clearly.	Joale ba tla khona ho bona hantle.
I felt like a child.	Ke ne ke ikutloa joaloka ngoana.
he thought.	a nahana.
Leave it to me.	Tlohela ho 'na.
I have nothing to do with the book.	Ha ke na taba le buka.
As a rule, they will wait until you get out of them.	E le molao, ba tla ema ho fihlela u tsoa ho bona.
Fun must be present.	Monate o tlameha ho ba teng.
We have decided on these questions.	Re entse qeto ea lipotso tsena.
So he let his people go.	Kahoo a etsa hore batho ba hae ba tsamaee.
My mother does that.	'Mè oa ka o etsa joalo.
I thought it was a bad thing.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke ntho e mpe.
Neither do I.	Leha e le nna.
The older boy was the last one.	Moshanyana e moholo e ne e le oa ho qetela.
You have this.	U na le sena.
Thank you so much for getting these.	Ke leboha haholo ka ho fumana tsena.
He spoke well, he thought, but he clearly did not understand.	O ne a bolela hantle, a nahana, empa ho hlakile hore o ne a sa utloisise.
I don't care about that anymore.	Ha ke sa na taba eo.
I'm thinking about it here.	Ke ntse ke nahana ka mona.
The boy is not talking about what happened.	Moshanyana ha a bue ka se etsahetseng.
I have a good job, so there it is.	Ke na le mosebetsi o motle, kahoo ho na le hoo.
I know we did not.	Kea tseba hore ha rea ​​e etsa.
I am traveling alone.	Ke tsamaea ke le mong.
Because we hope we can.	Hobane re tšepa hore re ka khona.
But my career was starting again.	Empa mosebetsi oa ka o ne o qala hape.
The team knows the area well.	Sehlopha se tseba sebaka seo hantle.
He used to get whatever he wanted.	O ne a tloaetse ho fumana eng kapa eng eo a e batlang.
But her husband refused to let her go.	Empa monna oa hae a hana ho mo lumella.
We want to buy him.	Re batla ho mo reka.
After all these years, the boy is still unable to swim.	Ka mor’a lilemo tsena tsohle, moshanyana eo o ntse a sa khone ho sesa.
He could buy whatever he wanted.	O ne a ka reka eng kapa eng eo a e batlang.
I have no problem with this.	Ha ke na bothata ka sena.
I sleep outside.	Ke robala ka ntle.
Their father is gone.	Ntate oa bona ha a eo.
Others can too.	Ba bang le bona ba ka khona.
And so it is.	'Me ho joalo.
And they are.	'Me ba joalo.
That is what we are.	Ke seo re leng sona.
Continue carefully.	Tsoela pele ka hloko.
That alone should be enough reason to be present.	Seo feela e lokela ho ba lebaka le lekaneng la ho ba teng.
He left it.	O ile a o tlohela.
It can be very strange.	E ka ba ntho e makatsang haholo.
That means everything.	Hoo ho bolela tsohle.
To think that they know everything.	Hore ba nahane hore ba tseba tsohle.
That's the law.	Ke molao.
Of course, nothing else happens.	Ehlile, ha ho letho le leng le etsahalang.
A little more.	Ho feta hanyane.
The team was the best team ever to play.	Sehlopha e ne e le sehlopha se setle ka ho fetisisa se kileng sa bapala.
Meet them regularly.	Kopana le bona ka linako tsohle.
But there were bad years there.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le lilemo tse mpe moo.
But they did not win.	Empa ha ba ka ba hlola.
I need to call.	Ke hloka ho letsa.
It's your job.	Ke mosebetsi oa hau.
Better, too.	E betere, hape.
You would not think of it but it is.	U ke ke ua e nahana empa ho joalo.
I always do.	Ke kamehla .
We hope you enjoy it too !.	Re tšepa hore le uena u tla e thabela!.
Of course, that is not the case.	Ha e le hantle, ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
Maybe you don't like that.	Mohlomong ha u rate seo.
I can't say it enough.	Ha ke khone ho e bua ho lekana.
New or old, all are treated the same.	E ncha kapa ea khale, bohle ba tšoaroa ka tsela e tšoanang.
If you have a question, please, comment here.	Haeba u na le potso, ka kopo, fana ka maikutlo mona.
My life, his life.	Bophelo ba ka, bophelo ba hae.
He is currently working as a high school teacher.	Hona joale o sebetsa e le tichere ea sekolo se phahameng.
It will take several days.	Ho tla nka matsatsi a 'maloa.
But that is exactly what happened recently.	Empa ke sona se ileng sa etsahala haufinyane.
But when it worked it was fun.	Empa ha e sebetsa ho ne ho le monate.
This was not the case.	Tsena e ne e se ntho e joalo.
He wanted information, and he wanted it quickly.	O ne a batla litaba, 'me a li batla kapele.
We only know it.	Re e tseba feela.
Maybe you can help.	Mohlomong u ka thusa.
Good for him we say.	Molemo ho eena re re.
I can't stand it, man.	Ke sitoa ho ema, monna.
A young man came to me.	Mohlankana e mong o ile a tla ho ’na.
No one helped her.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo thusa.
If you were there, you know, you wonder.	Haeba u ne u le teng, ua tseba, ua ipotsa.
They knew this.	Ba ne ba tseba sena.
This is not just necessary.	Sena ha se hlokahale feela.
Children with limbs.	Bana ba nang le maoto le matsoho.
And we will find you next year.	Mme re tla o fumana selemong se tlang.
You feel.	U ikutloa .
We decided that before we even had a party.	Re ile ra etsa qeto ea hore le pele re e-ba le mokete.
Maybe my idea is just bad.	Mohlomong mohopolo oa ka o mpe feela.
We never talk about him to them.	Le ka mohla ha re bue ka eena ho bona.
We offer that another car is at fault.	Re fana ka hore koloi e ‘ngoe e molato.
Like a weird thing is my thing.	Joalo ka ntho e makatsang ke ntho ea ka.
It's weird.	Ke mokhoa o makatsang.
You know it, they know it.	Le a e tseba, ba a e tseba.
I think he did something wrong.	Ke nka hore o entse ntho e mpe.
Of course he would.	Ehlile o ne a tla etsa joalo.
You can use it for many years.	U ka e sebelisa ka lilemo tse ngata.
Everywhere we would go with our parents.	Kae kapa kae moo re neng re ke ke ra ea le batsoali ba rona.
However, it is a good thing to do.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ntho e ntle ho e etsa.
I did this with my boyfriend.	Ke entse sena le mohlankana oa ka.
I start to think of my life as a way.	Ke qala ho nahana ka bophelo ba ka e le tsela.
But its a mistake to give.	Empa phoso ea eona ea ho fana.
That must have been a relief.	E tlameha ebe seo se ne se le boima.
He loves her.	O a mo rata.
You will find it.	O tla e fumana.
They do not like danger.	Ha ba rate kotsi.
This is not good but it works well.	Sena ha se setle empa se sebetsa hantle.
You have to decide.	O lokela ho etsa qeto.
However, it is too late.	Leha ho le joalo, nako e se e le morao haholo.
And for breakfast.	Le ka lijo tsa hoseng.
I'm just happy to have you.	Ke thabela ho ba le lona feela.
Yet that woman could be the only one.	Leha ho le joalo mosali eo e ka ba eena feela.
Money came in quickly.	Chelete e ile ea kena kapele.
But we could not go.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra khona ho tsamaea.
That was good news.	Eo e ne e le litaba tse monate.
My father was one of them.	Ntate e ne e le e mong oa bona.
On his way home, he met some old friends.	Ha a khutlela hae, o ile a kopana le metsoalle ea khale.
He loved to be great and to be strong.	O ne a rata ho ba moholo le ho ba matla.
I hope you enjoy living there.	Ke tšepa hore u tla thabela ho lula moo.
Besides, he was close.	Ntle le mona, o ne a le haufi.
Everyone knows everything.	E mong le e mong o tseba tsohle.
People enjoy that too.	Batho le bona ba thabela seo.
They would cry sometimes.	Ba ne ba lla ka linako tse ling.
It hurts too to see.	Ho bohloko le ho bona.
We do the same.	Le rōna re etsa joalo.
They have to go fast.	Li lokela ho tsamaea kapele.
I never thought he would be able to do that.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore a ka khona ho etsa seo.
I couldn’t even imagine that kind of money.	Ke ne ke sa khone le ho nahana ka chelete ea mofuta oo.
He never left.	Ha A ka A tloha.
And no one is going to have to tell me.	'Me ha ho motho ea tla tlameha ho mpolella.
But then good things usually happen.	Empa joale lintho tse ntle hangata li joalo.
No one should help him.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho mo thusa.
That hurts to watch.	Seo se bohloko ho se shebella.
I did not go with anyone.	Ha kea tsamaea le motho.
Then he heard it again.	Eaba oa e utloa hape.
He really means that.	O hlile a bolela seo.
I did not find it.	Ha kea e fumana.
I'm not sure where they are.	Ha ke tsebe hantle sebaka sa bona.
The place was alive.	Sebaka se ne se phela.
We do not pretend to be otherwise.	Ha re etse eka ho seng joalo.
There is no time for any of it, now.	Ha ho nako ea leha e le efe ea eona, joale.
Surely no one would suffer such a thing and be alive.	Ka sebele ha ho motho ea neng a ka utloa bohloko bo joalo ’me a phela.
But time is running out now.	Empa nako e se e le morao jwale.
I could not let him go.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho mo lumella hore a tsamaee.
However, there was a turning point.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se ho khutlela morao.
Even if you don't know.	Leha o sa tsebe.
He was an older child.	E ne e le ngoana e moholo.
Nobody knew about you.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba ka uena.
He did not go any further.	Ha a ka a ya pele.
There was no way to swim.	Ho ne ho se na mokhoa oa ho se sesa feela.
He left without saying goodbye.	O ile a tsamaea a sa re hantle.
That's when they open for dinner.	Ke ha ba bula lijo tsa mantsiboea.
Some of them walked away crying.	Ba bang ba bona ba ile ba tsamaea ba lla.
It could not come out.	E ne e ke ke ea tsoa.
You can stand there when you go out.	U ka ema moo ha u tsoa.
It was his family.	E ne e le lelapa la hae.
He knew some, but he did not know many.	Ba bang o ne a ba tseba, empa ba bangata ha a ka a ba tseba.
It is for the best.	Ke bakeng sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
As they used me.	Joalo ka ha ba ile ba sebelisa 'na.
And this house.	Le ntlo ena.
There are some mental things you may need.	Ho na le lintho tsa kelello tseo u ka li hlokang.
This is very important right now.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo hona joale.
That's right, water.	Ke hantle, metsi.
I already understand what you said.	Ke se ke utloisisa seo u se buileng.
We don't know what it is.	Ha re tsebe hore na ke eng.
I did not want to be one.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho ba eena.
There is nothing more I can do.	Haho sa na letho leo nka le etsang.
I went to him.	Ke ile ka ea ho eena.
But today is the day.	Empa kajeno ke letsatsi.
This is really strange.	Sena ke ntho e makatsang ruri.
I think you have a problem.	Ke nahana hore o na le bothata.
They take it from there.	Ba e nka ho tloha moo.
I am reading it.	Ke ntse ke e bala.
It never was, it never will be.	Ha ho eso be teng, ha ho sa tla ba teng.
We made him.	Re mo entse.
If you take that situation, it certainly is.	Haeba u nka boemo boo, ka sebele ho joalo.
You could not eat.	U ne u ke ke ua ja.
And he came.	Mme a tla.
That was the last thing he said.	Eo e bile ntho ea ho qetela eo a e buileng.
Go on with your life, he said.	Tsoela pele bophelo ba hau, o ile a re.
I have to say all the food, of course.	Ke lokela ho re lijo tsohle, ha e le hantle.
You don't have to say it.	Ha o a tlameha ho e bua.
Lots and lots of food.	Lijo le lijo tse ngata.
Who was this strange young man?	Mohlankana eo ya makatsang e ne e le mang?
It goes faster, you pay more.	E tsamaea kapele, o lefa ho feta.
Time for hind legs.	Nako ea maoto a morao.
I don’t know why this should be the case.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha sena se lokela ho ba joalo.
He says he can't do it.	O re ha a khone ho e etsa.
And some days can be lonely.	'Me matsatsi a mang e ka ba bolutu.
He did not want to hear.	O ne a sa batle ho utloa.
She is no longer anything.	Ha a sa le letho.
It would have been difficult to do so.	Ho ka be ho bile thata ho etsa joalo.
I always write that instead.	Ke lula ke ngola hore ho e-na le hoo.
That is where we are today.	Ke moo re leng teng kajeno.
And besides that.	Mme ntle le seo.
I'm glad that worked.	Ke thabetse hore ebe seo se ile sa sebetsa.
I know it .	Kea e tseba .
He did not like it.	O ne a sa o rate.
Only thirty people were present.	Ke batho ba mashome a mararo feela ba neng ba le teng.
I do not want this to be the only one.	Ha ke batle hore sena e be se seng feela.
He told me that he loved her more than anything.	O ile a mpolella hore o mo rata ho feta ntho leha e le efe.
He stayed only one day.	O ile a lula letsatsi le le leng feela.
He knows her very well.	O mo tseba haholo.
It goes on and on.	E ntse e tsoela pele.
He was the only person he knew.	Ke eena feela motho eo a neng a mo tseba.
There was no one in the room.	Ho ne ho se motho ka phaposing.
Maybe pay.	Mohlomong lefa.
Tell us more about it.	Re bolelle haholoanyane ka eona.
He is a man.	O monna.
On some days, he did not eat anything.	Ka matsatsi a mang, o ne a sa je letho.
All the best so far.	Tsohle tse ntle ho fihlela joale.
She handed over power to her son last year at a party.	O ile a fana ka matla ho mora oa hae selemong se fetileng ka mokete.
I don't think what it is.	Ha ke nahane hore na ke eng.
It's just for them.	Ke tsa bona feela.
We have them where we want them.	Re na le tsona moo re li batlang teng.
I want to get out more.	Ke batla ho tsoa ho feta.
Very, very wet.	Haholo, metsi haholo.
It was really hard to understand.	Ho ne ho hlile ho se thata ho utloisisa.
I get that sometimes.	Ke fumana joalo ka linako tse ling.
Be like water.	E-ba joaloka metsi.
He was drinking heavily.	O ne a ntse a noa haholo.
We hope to make money from this.	Re tšepa ho etsa chelete ka sena.
You take the place.	U nka sebaka.
We are here and we have work to do.	Re mona mme re na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa.
The room was as beautiful as the space.	Kamore e ne e le ntle joalo ka sebaka.
That is not what you should consider.	Seo ha se seo u lokelang ho se nahana.
You can comment as often as you like.	U ka fana ka maikutlo hangata kamoo u ratang.
That's the problem.	Ke bothata.
His place.	Sebaka sa hae.
He seemed to like that.	O ne a bonahala a rata seo.
But you must state the time and place.	Empa u lokela ho bolela nako le sebaka.
The car was still there.	Koloi e ne e ntse e le teng.
I do not know why.	Ha ke tsebe lebaka.
He is very professional.	O setsebi haholo.
That was easy enough.	Seo se ne se le bonolo ho lekana.
They have no power.	Ha ba na matla.
I will come to you.	Ke tla fihla ho uena.
The pain was very real.	Bohloko e ne e le ba sebele haholo.
But when things did not go well, he did not plan on doing so.	Empa ha lintho li sa tsamaee hantle, o ne a sa rera.
So in the end, he goes alone.	Kahoo qetellong, o tsamaea a le mong.
But it looks very fun.	Empa e shebahala e le monate haholo.
There is something strange.	Ho na le ntho e makatsang.
We can't know for sure, now.	Re ke ke ra tseba hantle, joale.
He was still the man.	E ne e ntse e le monna eo.
This was a problem.	Sena e ne e le bothata.
I'm working on that.	Ke ntse ke sebetsa ho seo.
Buy what you need and come back.	Reka seo u se hlokang ebe u khutla.
He wanted anyone.	O ne a batla mang kapa mang.
She is just fine.	O hantle feela.
So, they come out and believe it.	Kahoo, ba tsoa ’me ba e lumela.
Do not go back.	U se ke ua khutla.
The dog is alive.	Ntja ea phela.
We can't stay.	Re ke ke ra lula.
Maybe the child has them.	Mohlomong ngoana o na le bona.
He seemed to understand exactly what was going on.	O ne a bonahala a utloisisa hantle se etsahalang.
So it is best not to tell anyone.	Kahoo ho molemo hore u se ke ua bolella mang kapa mang.
That was not the case here.	Ho ne ho se joalo mona.
There is a risk of error.	Ho na le kotsi ea phoso.
I only work here.	Ke sebetsa mona feela.
People found money to be very good.	Batho ba ile ba fumana chelete e le molemo haholo.
I'm sorry about you.	Ke masoabi ka uena.
People want to enjoy life.	Batho ba batla ho thabela bophelo ba bona.
But he could see it now.	Empa o ne a se a e bona joale.
Going to work.	Ho ea mosebetsing.
You can find the error.	U ka fumana phoso.
You should too.	Le uena u lokela ho ba joalo.
Read the book.	Bala buka.
He was still busy.	O ne a ntse a phathahane.
He needed a place.	O ne a hloka sebaka.
Everyone loved it.	E mong le e mong o ne a e rata.
I will take care of you both.	Ke tla le hlokomela ka bobeli.
Everything that happened yesterday happens again.	Tsohle tse etsahetseng maobane li etsahala hape.
Just do what you want to do.	Etsa feela seo u batlang ho se etsa.
He wanted to make sure it never happened again.	O ne a batla ho etsa bonnete ba hore ha e sa etsahala hape.
And it's not good.	Mme ha e ntle.
I wish you were a girl.	Ke lakatsa eka u ka be u le ngoanana.
He wanted to think more about this.	O ne a batla ho nahana ka taba ena haholoanyane.
He works hard for his money.	O sebetsa ka thata bakeng sa chelete ea hae.
The work was hard.	Mosebetsi o ne o le boima.
I hope you like them.	Ke tšepa hore u tla li rata.
Power over him.	Matla a mo feta.
Maybe we'll wait a long time.	Mohlomong re tla ema nako e telele.
We just have to plan it every day.	Re tlameha feela ho e rera letsatsi le letsatsi.
My job was very simple.	Mosebetsi oa ka o ne o le bonolo haholo.
Could it have been them? 	Na e ka be e bile bona?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
They buy wherever they like.	Ba reka kae kapa kae moo ba ratang.
I'll have to think about it.	Ke tla tlameha ho nahana ka eona.
Then the time came.	Eaba nako ea fihla.
I think this should work very quickly.	Ke nahana hore ena e lokela ho sebetsa kapele haholo.
I know so many things.	Ke tseba lintho tse ngata haholo.
it is useless to think about it.	ha ho na thuso ho nahana ka taba eo.
But you did not do this simple homework assignment.	Empa ha ua ka ua etsa mosebetsi ona o bonolo oa sekolo.
I never thought about it.	Ke ne ke sa nahana ka eona.
The teacher asked her many questions.	Tichere e ile ea mo botsa lipotso tse ngata.
I will definitely try this soon.	Ka sebele ke tla leka sena haufinyane.
Or a better life.	Kapa bophelo bo betere.
So you start planning for them.	Kahoo u qala ho ba rera.
It's kind of.	Ke mofuta oa.
I saw it close.	Ke e bone e le haufi.
I never thought we would be friends.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore le rōna re tla ba metsoalle.
It’s the age of most people here.	Ke lilemo tsa batho ba bangata mona.
He would be something.	O ne a tla ba ntho e itseng.
Soon they did.	Kapele ba etsa joalo.
Have a family there.	Eba le lelapa moo.
All the new news was bad.	Litaba tsohle tse ncha li ne li le mpe.
It is the best so far.	Ke eona e ntle ka ho fetisisa ho fihlela joale.
Having trouble sleeping.	Ho ba le bothata ba ho robala.
It is for him.	Ke bakeng sa hae.
I will make that decision.	Ke tla etsa qeto eo.
The children enjoyed this.	Bana ba ne ba thabetse sena.
I thought he would want to know.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tla batla ho tseba.
Many refused to leave.	Ba bangata ba ile ba hana ho tsamaea.
I'm tired of that.	Ke khathetse ke eona eo.
They are arrested.	Ba tšoaroa.
Very good for this week.	Ke hantle haholo bakeng sa beke ena.
He could not find friends here in the future.	O ne a ke ke a fumana metsoalle mona nakong e tlang.
But sometimes one has to do that.	Empa ka linako tse ling motho o tlameha ho etsa joalo.
I've seen them before.	Ke ba bone pele.
Today, no one knows her.	Kajeno, ha ho motho ea mo tsebang.
They are waiting for their turn to speak.	Ba emetse nako ea bona ea ho bua.
They almost seem like friends sometimes.	Ba batla ba bonahala eka ke metsoalle ka linako tse ling.
I feel that way about it.	Ke ikutloa joalo ka eona.
Really old stuff.	Lintho tsa khale tse makatsang ruri.
I can see it happening near me.	Ke e bona e etsahala haufi le nna.
He learned to count money.	O ile a ithuta ho bala chelete.
That's his way.	Ke tsela ya hae.
There are usually not many there.	Hangata ha ho na tse ngata moo.
Now is the time for trouble.	Hona joale ke nakong ea mathata.
One has to live a lifetime.	Motho o tlameha ho phela bophelo bohle.
You saw them last night, too.	O ba bone maobane bosiu, le bona.
They know how to use it.	Ba tseba ho e sebelisa.
He thought things through.	O ile a nahana lintho hantle.
I'm still working on it.	Ke ntse ke sebetsa ho eona.
It was a good book.	E ne e le buka e ntle.
Maybe we would do that, sometime.	Mohlomong re ne re tla etsa joalo, ka nako e 'ngoe.
You have to do better.	U tlameha ho etsa betere.
He has a wonderful life with us.	O na le bophelo bo monate le rona.
I can do another one, or I can just use this one.	Nka etsa e 'ngoe, kapa ke sebelisa ena feela.
He went out to talk to her.	A tsoa ho ea bua le eona.
Now he knew this could not happen.	Joale o ne a tseba hore sena se ke ke sa etsahala.
Or maybe some people don't see it that way.	Kapa mohlomong batho ba bang ha ba bone ka tsela ena.
Without me, you are nothing.	Ntle le nna, ha o letho.
Buy as much food as you can.	Reka lijo tse ngata kamoo u ka khonang.
It takes longer than you might think.	Ho nka nako e telele ho feta kamoo u ka nahanang kateng.
No one saw him come.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo bona a fihla.
Only here and there.	Feela mona le ho feta.
We should do it or we should not do it.	Re lokela ho e etsa kapa ha rea ​​lokela ho e etsa.
None of your business.	Ha se taba ea hau.
We think it might have come in contact with something.	Re nahana hore e ka 'na eaba e ile ea kopana le ntho e itseng.
I can't speak right now.	Ha ke khone ho bua hantle hona joale.
It's just a thing.	Ke ntho feela.
Beautiful children died.	Bana ba batle ba ile ba hlokahala.
One day, they too would take him away.	Ka letsatsi le leng, le bona ba ne ba tla mo nka.
He left without taking a letter.	O ile a tsamaea ntle le ho nka lengolo.
People are busy.	Batho ba phathahane.
I called several friends.	Ke ile ka letsetsa metsoalle e ’maloa.
See how you want it.	Sheba kamoo u batlang kateng.
Everything was very good.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e bile ntle haholo.
There is nothing for you here.	Ha ho na letho bakeng sa hau mona.
The problem is you.	Bothata ke uena.
But the boy did not realize this.	Empa moshanyana eo ha aa ka a hlokomela sena.
Finally we are something.	Qetellong re ho hong.
He knew what was going on and did nothing.	O ne a tseba se etsahalang mme ha a ka a etsa letho.
We had never met.	Re ne re e-s'o kopane.
I knew it was there.	Ke ne ke tseba hore e teng.
See you soon!.	Ke tla u bona haufinyane!.
I knew he would never come back.	Ke ne ke tseba hore a ke ke a khutla.
Look closely at you.	Sheba haufi le uena.
I want to sing it.	Ke se ke batla ho e bina.
Why three long years of hard work?	Lilemo tse tharo tse telele tsa ho sebetsa ka thata ka lebaka la eng?
It may be too late for me on this one but it can help others.	Mohlomong e se e le morao haholo bakeng sa ka ka sena empa e ka thusa ba bang.
He says something.	O bua ho hong.
This is not difficult.	Sena ha se thata.
Except for what he did.	Ntle le seo a se entseng.
Next, think about what kind of space you need.	Ka mor'a moo, nahana ka hore na u hloka sebaka sa mofuta ofe.
Too many books.	Libuka tse ngata haholo.
I love you for who you are.	Ke u rata kamoo u leng kateng.
Things like this.	Lintho tse kang tsena.
I left the picture.	Ke ile ka tlohela setšoantšo.
I try to anticipate and forget about it.	Ke leka ho lebella le ho lebala ka eona.
Yes, it is not so good.	E, ha e ntle hakaalo.
That's all the doctor said.	Ke sohle seo ngaka e se buileng.
It could have been one of them.	E ka be e bile e 'ngoe ea tsona.
You will want them very well.	U tla li batla hantle haholo.
We will make it easier to work.	Re tla etsa hore ho be bonolo ho sebetsa.
She has a job she loves.	O na le mosebetsi oo a o ratang.
The other is mental.	E 'ngoe ke ea kelello.
You will need to know.	O tla lokela ho tseba.
But he has something in me.	Empa o na le ho hong ho 'na.
They have never been like that.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba joalo.
But it was.	Empa ho ne ho le joalo.
It was very late in the evening.	E ne e le mantsiboea haholo.
Please be here.	Ke kopa o be mona.
There would be a mistake without them.	Ho ne ho tla ba le phoso ntle le bona.
I hope someone will use it.	Ke tšepa hore ho na le motho ea tla e sebelisa.
You did that.	Ke uena ea entseng joalo.
It can be very professional.	E ka ba setsebi haholo.
So that's why he was always alone, he thought.	Kahoo ke kahoo a neng a lula a le mong, o ile a nahana.
He had never seen it before.	O ne a e-s'o ka a e bona pele.
We wondered about this.	Re ile ra ipotsa ka sena.
Whether he liked it or not.	Hore na o ne a e rata kapa che.
To me they were the best.	Ho 'na li ne li le molemo ka ho fetisisa.
And you feel very alive.	'Me u ikutloa u phela haholo.
This is very important to do.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo ho se etsa.
I had mine.	Ke bile le ea ka.
But you have to go beyond that.	Empa u tlameha ho feta ho eona.
Apparently throughout his career he used both.	Ho bonahala eka nakong eohle ea mosebetsi oa hae o ile a sebelisa ka bobeli.
I need a room.	Ke hloka kamore.
It was a strange thing.	E ne e le taba e makatsang.
Father and child.	Ntate le ngoana.
He believed that my job was as important as his.	O ne a lumela hore mosebetsi oa ka o bohlokoa joaloka oa hae.
He had no money for her.	O ne a se na chelete ho eena.
It's almost time for a walk.	E batla e le nako ea ho tsamaea.
I'm so glad to be here.	Ke thabile haholo ho ba mona.
The water is coming.	Metsi a tla.
He knew something.	O ne a tseba ho hong.
I want to do something weird.	Ke batla ho etsa ntho e makatsang.
There is only one way to know.	Ho na le mokhoa o le mong feela oa ho tseba.
The truth was that he could not be seen in it.	'Nete e ne e le hore o ne a ke ke a bonahala ho eona.
I know this will not happen.	Kea tseba hore sena se ke ke sa etsahala.
And we're here to help.	Mme re mona ho thusa.
Thank you so much for all you do.	Ke leboha haholo ka tsohle tseo u li etsang.
They spend the night there.	Ba hlola bosiu moo.
It is very easy to do.	Ho bonolo haholo ho e etsa.
The young man said that he wished he could.	Mohlankana eo o ile a re o lakatsa eka a ka khona.
The question is difficult.	Potso e thata.
Life is truly better.	Ruri bophelo bo betere.
He did everything we needed him to do.	O entse sohle seo re neng re hloka hore a se etse.
For now.	Bakeng sa hona joale.
How they think that is beyond me.	Kamoo ba nahanang hore seo se mpheta.
I had to do that with myself.	Ke ne ke lokela ho etsa seo ka nna.
I can't tell anyone.	Ha ke khone ho bolella mang kapa mang.
I want to do something, to be human.	Ke batla ho etsa ho hong, ho ba motho.
Where did he come from?	O ne a tsoa hokae?
But that is not the case now.	Empa ha ho joalo hona joale.
We did nothing wrong.	Ha rea ​​etsa letho le phoso.
Then you will be there.	Joale u tla ba teng.
But let's not say you just opened up the water.	Empa ha re re u sa tsoa bula metsi.
I have to look at it.	Ke tlameha ho e sheba.
There is something wrong with your life, you know.	Ho na le phoso ka bophelo ba hao, ua tseba.
That's right.	Ke 'nete.
However, it is in the past.	Leha ho le joalo, ke nakong e fetileng.
What? 	Eng?
He knew what he was doing.	O ne a tseba seo a se etsang.
Some are suffering today.	Ba bang baa utloa bohloko kajeno.
I did not ask you.	Ha kea ka ka u botsa.
I needed my delicious coffee in the morning.	Ke ne ke hloka kofi ea ka e monate hoseng.
You can stand now.	O ka ema jwale.
To a girl nearby.	Ho ngoanana ea haufi.
I can say that.	Nka bolela seo.
But he did.	Empa o entse joalo.
What it needed.	Seo e neng e se hloka.
He always has time to help others.	Kamehla o na le nako ea ho thusa ba bang.
Everyone seems to be talking about the moment.	Ho bonahala e mong le e mong a bua ka nako eo.
Which is a very serious mistake.	E leng phoso e mpe haholo.
Because of many things.	Ka lebaka la lintho tse ngata.
It makes it easier.	E etsa hore ho be bonolo ho feta.
He cried a lot when he left.	A lla haholo ha a tloha.
It could still happen one day.	E ntse e ka etsahala ka letsatsi le leng.
You will see your parents soon.	U tla bona batsoali ba hao haufinyane.
But that was the first one.	Empa eo e bile ea pele.
It could have been.	Ho ka be ho bile teng.
I think it is very important.	Ke nahana hore e bohlokoa haholo.
The young man asked for it.	Mohlankana eo o ne a e kopa.
Not even my first day on the job.	Leha e le letsatsi la ka la pele mosebetsing.
As time goes on.	Ha nako e ntse e feta.
Are you okay?	O hantle?
But this is nothing new.	Empa sena ha se ntho e ncha.
Try to make it understandable.	Leka ho etsa hore u utloisise.
A truth-seeker does not want anything.	Motho ea batlang 'nete ha a batle letho le leng.
I pay you.	Kea u lefa.
I went home and my parents were very happy.	Ke ile ka ea ha ka ’me batsoali ba ka ba ne ba thabile haholo.
I could be in a better position.	Nka ba le boemo bo betere.
I do not need to drink.	Ha ke hloke ho noa.
It's a difficult thing.	Ke ntho e thata.
There is no way to move.	Ha ho mokhoa oa ho tsamaea.
This is a problem.	Sena ke bothata.
He wonders how old he really is.	Oa ipotsa hore na ha e le hantle o lilemo li kae.
It is their time to have their baby.	Ke nako ea bona ea ho ba le ngoana oa bona.
Then he understood.	Joale o ne a utloisisa.
He hoped it would stand.	O ne a tšepa hore e tla ema.
Too many years.	Lilemo tse ngata haholo.
He could not sleep.	O ne a sitoa ho robala .
My husband is not there.	Monna oa ka ha a eo.
Of course, that happens often.	Ha e le hantle, seo se etsahala hangata.
I would like more.	Nka rata ho feta.
Think back.	Nahana ka morao.
There may be a chance of a prolonged or dangerous fall.	Ho ka 'na ha e-ba le monyetla oa ho oa ha nako e telele kapa o kotsi.
Then he saw the truth.	Joale o ile a bona 'nete.
Very good though.	E ntle haholo leha ho le joalo.
I can't look right now.	Ha ke khone ho sheba hona joale.
He would not allow this to pass.	O ne a ke ke a lumella sena ho feta.
He needed some time alone.	O ne a hloka nako e itseng a le mong.
It was a time, or a time ago.	E ne e le nako, kapa ke nako e fetileng.
They all say that, you know.	Kaofela ba bolela seo, o ya tseba.
I was just beginning to wonder what happened to you.	Ke ne ke qala ho ipotsa hore na ho etsahetse'ng ka uena.
I like the band here.	Ke rata sehlopha mona.
But he is easy on all.	Empa o bonolo ho tsohle.
We can even go to school with our children.	Re ka ba ra kena sekolo le bana ba rona.
It was a bedroom.	E ne e le kamore ea ho robala.
He seemed to want to be me, but it was better.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka o batla ho ba 'na, empa ho molemo.
It looks good to me.	E shebahala e le ntle ho nna.
I am a young man.	Ke mohlankana.
It could be worse, you know.	E ka ba mpe le ho feta, ua tseba.
Maybe we will do it without getting caught.	Mohlomong re tla e etsa ntle le ho tšoaroa.
I did not hear you.	Ha kea u utloa.
My people are very dangerous.	Batho ba ka ba kotsi haholo.
I just wanted to know what was going on.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho tseba se etsahalang.
Work hard, play hard.	Sebetsa ka thata, bapala ka thata.
I hope to do it again for real.	Ke tšepa ho e etsa hape ka 'nete.
Find what? 	Fumana eng?
I sat down quickly.	Ke ile ka lula kapele.
Or it is not enough.	Kapa ha hoa lekana.
He did not need to see them.	O ne a sa hloke ho ba bona.
I wish I were better for you.	nka be ke le molemo ho wena.
If that happens, we don't need to do anything.	Haeba e etsahala, ha ho hlokahale hore re etse letho.
However, he did not have it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a ka a ba le eona.
Sometimes, it is not so bad.	Ka linako tse ling, ha e mpe hakaalo.
I don't really care.	Ha ke tsotelle ruri.
Do what he was supposed to do for his family.	Etsa seo a neng a lokela ho se etsetsa lelapa la hae.
I have a lot of time for her.	Ke na le nako e ngata bakeng sa hae.
You just need to be yourself.	U hloka feela ho ba uena.
I can handle you too.	Le uena nka u tšoara.
I gave it up.	Ke ile ka e tlohela.
In the same year.	Selemong sona seo.
As a result, .	Kahoo, .
Don’t ask why I need to get it, I just do.	Se ke oa botsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha ke hloka ho e fumana, ke mpa ke etsa joalo.
So, we're done.	Kahoo, re qetile.
Coffee is incredibly good.	Kofi e ntle ka mokhoa o makatsang.
So be it.	E be joalo le.
We have a mind.	Re na le kelello.
He needed to seek psychological help.	O ne a hloka ho batla thuso ea kelello.
The children go back to school.	Bana ba khutlela sekolong.
Maybe we can go somewhere.	Mohlomong re ka ea sebakeng se seng.
But they may not happen every time we fall asleep.	Empa li ka 'na tsa se ke tsa etsahala nako le nako ha re robala.
These shoes fit perfectly.	Lieta tsena li lekana hantle.
It was now.	E ne e le hona joale.
And that is what he needed now.	Mme ke seo a neng a se hloka jwale.
He will be back soon.	O tla khutla haufinyane.
Many of them went.	Ba bangata ba bona ba ile.
I'm not saying you are, of course.	Ha ke re u joalo, ehlile.
We'll have to fix something.	Re tla tlameha ho lokisa ho hong.
But problems remain.	Empa mathata a ntse a le teng.
Or be it important to you even if it does.	Kapa e be ea bohlokoa ho uena le haeba e etsa joalo.
Just a long time.	Nako e telele feela.
It makes sense and it matters.	Ho na le kelello 'me ho na le taba.
We are the best.	Re ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
I am leaving in the morning.	Ke tsamaea hoseng.
Obviously you will find fault.	Ho hlakile hore u tla fumana phoso.
We don't have a chance in the long run.	Ha re na monyetla ka nako e telele.
We have to do that.	Re lokela ho etsa seo.
But no, he is not.	Empa che, ha se eena.
Taking it again today.	Ho e nka hape kajeno.
We read a book every day.	Re bala buka letsatsi le letsatsi.
Like him.	Joalo ka eena.
We could do whatever we wanted here.	Re ne re ka etsa eng kapa eng eo re e batlang mona.
But over time, that is what happened.	Empa ha nako e ntse e ea, e ile ea lula.
It is closer to that than anything.	E haufi le seo ho feta eng kapa eng.
Like real life.	Jwalo ka bophelo ba sebele.
Either way, it was a problem.	Ka tsela e 'ngoe kapa e 'ngoe, e ne e le mathata.
This is unlikely to work.	Sena ha se na monyetla oa ho sebetsa.
It would be.	E ka ba.
He said nothing.	Ha a ka a bua letho.
Some people can take it or leave it.	Batho ba bang ba ka e nka kapa ba e tlohela.
The second was his strange mind.	Ea bobeli e ne e le kelello ea hae e makatsang.
However, it has no problems.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e na mathata.
I want to know how, why, when.	Ke batla ho tseba hore na joang, hobaneng, neng.
And no, not at all.	'Me che, ha ho joalo.
I would like to know how to do this well.	Ke kopa ho tseba mokhoa oa ho etsa sena hantle.
Or she didn't want to talk.	Kapa e ne e sa batle ho bua.
You really need one in every room.	U hlile u hloka e 'ngoe ka kamoreng e' ngoe le e 'ngoe.
They were very important.	E ne e le ba bohlokoa haholo.
It would never have happened.	Le ka mohla ho ne ho ke ke ha etsahala.
It was a wonderful picture.	E ne e le setšoantšo se makatsang.
In this way, to.	Ka mokhoa ona, ho.
I stand.	Ke ema.
Neither did I.	Le ’na ha kea ka ka bua.
Of course, that is not what happened.	Ehlile, ha se se etsahetseng.
I asked if he understood.	Ke ile ka botsa hore na oa utloisisa.
So I will know that you are probably a real person.	Kahoo ke tla tseba hore ho ka etsahala hore ebe u motho oa sebele.
He wants to see it.	O batla ho o bona.
And we find a way to win.	Mme re fumana tsela ya ho hlola.
They had the best team ever.	Ba ne ba e-na le sehlopha se setle ka ho fetisisa.
You need new clothes.	U hloka liaparo tse ncha.
No one left school early.	Ha ho le ea mong ea ileng a tlohela sekolo pele ho nako.
She has a son.	O na le mora oa hae.
Just stay that way.	Dula feela jwalo.
Write a look.	Ngola buka.
Even better.	Molemo le ho feta.
But it was not hard work for me.	Empa e ne e se mosebetsi o boima ho ’na.
So why did you do that?	Joale ke hobane'ng ha u entse joalo?
But that is not what happened in the past.	Empa ha se se ileng sa etsahala nakong e fetileng.
That’s why you know you can trust your team.	Ke ka lebaka leo u tsebang hore u ka tšepa sehlopha sa hau.
You had a hard day.	U bile le letsatsi le boima.
They all gave us something to look forward to.	Kaofela ba ile ba re fa ntho eo re neng re ka e lebella.
We are playing.	Re ntse re bapala.
We spent the night.	Re ile ra qeta bosiu.
There is nothing like it.	Ha ho letho le tšoanang le lona.
I think we could have seen it coming.	Ke nahana hore re ka be re e bone e tla.
However he did not speak.	Leha ho le joalo ha aa ka a bua.
That's how you know it's best.	Ke ka moo o tsebang hore e molemo ka ho fetisisa.
So he kept going with this.	Kahoo a tsoela pele ho tsamaea le sena.
He did not know exactly why.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
It's close to what.	E haufi le eng.
I loved learning.	Ke ne ke rata ho ithuta.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho joalo.
Many people tried to find him.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba leka ho mo fumana.
I wanted money in any way.	Ke ne ke batla chelete ka tsela leha e le efe.
They tried.	Ba ne ba leka.
Yes, it will.	E, ka sebele e tla etsa joalo.
Or go again.	Kapa tsamaea hape.
We are all powerless.	Kaofela ha re na matla.
The past tense in the present tense.	Nako e fetileng nakong ya jwale.
I don't care anymore.	Ha ke sa na taba.
This makes them easy to learn.	Sena se etsa hore ho be bonolo ho ithuta tsona.
They keep saying that.	Ba nna ba bua jwalo.
I strongly deny that.	Ke hana seo ka matla.
The back is the issue.	Ka morao ke taba.
Certainly not his father.	Ka sebele e ne e se ntate oa hae.
He knew his way.	O ne a tseba tsela ea hae.
I drink water.	Ke noa metsi.
As far as he wants to, he has already heard.	Ho fihlela moo a batlang, o se a utloile.
But you can do things with that.	Empa u ka etsa lintho ka seo.
Now, he did.	Jwale, o ile a etsa jwalo.
That way we can keep an eye out.	Ka tsela eo re ka dula re sheba.
No one could love him.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a ka mo rata.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
Even better is the absence.	Ho molemo le ho feta ke ho se be teng.
It was not a win-win situation.	E ne e se boemo ba ho hlola.
There was a lot there.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse ngata moo.
Finally! 	Qetellong!
You can be something else.	U ka ba ntho e 'ngoe hape.
They are in it almost daily.	Ke ho tsona hoo e ka bang letsatsi le letsatsi.
There was no way he could get past her.	Ho ne ho se tsela ya ho mo feta.
No woman or man spoke.	Ha ho mosali kapa monna ea ileng a bua.
A wonderful but fun book.	Buka e makatsang empa e monate.
But they needed more sleep.	Empa ba ne ba hloka ho robala haholoanyane.
We may not know.	Re ka 'na ra se ke ra tseba.
She did very well !.	O entse hantle haholo!.
Also, none of these are new.	Hape, ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsena e ncha.
People love new things.	Batho ba rata lintho tse ncha.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
I'm not sure this helps you.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore sena se o thusa.
You don't even have to ask him, he just does it.	Ha o a tlameha le ho mo botsa, o etsa joalo feela.
Sometimes they never tell anyone before.	Ka linako tse ling ha ho mohla ba kileng ba bolella motho pele.
Because her husband would be at work.	Hobane monna oa hae o ne a tla be a le mosebetsing.
It would be nice to see you again.	Ho ka ba monate ho u bona hape.
I think it was his home.	Ke nahana hore e ne e le ha hae.
Have you ever seen real life like that.	Na u kile ua e bona bophelo ba sebele joalo ka eona.
If you do, the login will not stop.	Haeba u etsa joalo, ho kena le hona ho ke ke ha ema.
I couldn't find it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e fumana.
Here comes the hard thing.	Mona ho tla ntho e thata.
He made many people.	O entse batho ba bangata.
I did the same.	Le ’na ke ne ke entse se tšoanang.
Well, there is.	Be, ho na le.
I looked at them.	Ka ba sheba.
I give them.	Ke a ba fa.
You need to listen to him.	O lokela ho mo utloa.
Probably not one or the other.	Mohlomong ha se e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe.
You will never find it again.	Ha o sa tla hlola o e fumana.
They want pain.	Ba batla bohloko.
Of course it was.	Ho hlakile hore ho ne ho le joalo.
He thought it might be someone else.	O ne a nahana hore mohlomong ke motho e mong.
I think so.	Ke nahana hore ho joalo.
Do well this time.	Etsa hantle ka nako ena.
We started talking.	Re ile ra qala ho bua.
But please don't tell Mom.	Empa ke kopa o seke oa bolella 'Mè.
Or hear anyone.	Kapa utloa mang kapa mang.
This item is useless!	Ntho ena ha e na thuso!
And to see them.	Le ho ba bona.
I forget some.	Ke lebala tse ling.
My mother.	'M'e oa ka.
It would not work.	E ne e ke ke ea sebetsa.
I have taken you from my Father with him from of old.	Ke u nkile ho Ntate le eena ho tloha khale.
That's really nice.	Ke ntho e ntle ruri.
I'm not sure where I'm going.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke ea hokae.
You can call her later.	U ka mo letsetsa ka mor'a moo.
I was already very close to them.	Ke ne ke se ke le haufi haholo le bona.
There is no one you want.	Ha ho motho moo u mo batlang teng.
I knew the truth.	Ke ne ke tseba ’nete.
It is very important to be yourself	Ho bohlokoa haholo ho ba uena
I plan to have more.	Ke rera ho ba le tse ling .
Please do so in the future.	Ke kopa u etse joalo nakong e tlang.
Tell us when to come.	Re bolelle nako ea ho tla.
They did their homework and their footwork.	Ba entse mosebetsi oa bona oa sekolo le mosebetsi oa bona oa maoto.
No one has ever done that.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a etsa joalo.
I just got mine today.	Ke sa tsoa fumana ea ka kajeno.
I wonder why he is so sorry.	Kea ipotsa hore na o masoabi ke eng.
It is also not difficult.	Le eona ha e thata.
I wish you.	kea u lakatsa .
Their life was not easy.	Bophelo ba bona bo ne bo se bonolo.
Find someone who will drive you home.	Fumana motho ea tla u khanna hae.
Now here we are.	Jwale re mona.
It wasn't too close.	E ne e se haufi hakaalo.
Do important work.	Etsa mosebetsi oa bohlokoa.
There is no way at all.	Ho hang ha ho tsela.
He has to make her see that.	O lokela ho etsa hore a bone seo.
I can't imagine life without him.	Ha ke khone ho nahana bophelo ntle le eena.
She is tired.	O khathetse.
My last request.	Kopo ea ka ea ho qetela.
There seems to be a question.	Ho bonahala eka ho na le potso.
It's hard to look at him.	Ho thata ho mo sheba.
I cried again.	Ke ile ka lla hape.
Then the people began to notice.	Joale batho ba ile ba qala ho hlokomela.
There is no other.	Ha ho e 'ngoe.
He now plans to retire soon.	Hona joale o rera ho tlohela mosebetsi haufinyane.
Several people had money, and many did not.	Batho ba ’maloa ba ne ba e-na le chelete, ’me ba bangata ba ne ba se na eona.
Maybe something was going to happen.	Mohlomong ho ne ho tla etsahala ntho e itseng.
However, it was useless to think about that now.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se na thuso ho nahana ka seo hona joale.
Now he had a lot of money.	Joale o ne a e-na le chelete e ngata.
If it was clear, it was.	Haeba ho ne ho hlakile, ho ne ho le joalo.
The book was useless.	Buka eo e ne e se na thuso ea letho.
Time and space do not exist without human opinion.	Nako le sebaka ha li teng ntle le maikutlo a motho.
But it was a wonderful party, and he had done well.	Empa e bile mokete o monate, mme o ne a entse hantle.
There is no need for anything like that.	Ha ho hlokahale hore ho be le ntho leha e le efe e joalo.
It will be very dangerous.	Ho tla ba kotsi haholo.
You understand things.	U utloisisa lintho.
There is no place to live.	Ha ho sebaka sa ho phela.
Otherwise you walk or stand.	Ho seng joalo u tsamaea kapa ua ema.
But others kept coming.	Empa tse ling li ile tsa ’na tsa tla.
And now this.	Mme jwale sena.
But no one really knew what to do.	Empa ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
However, it is better to think.	Leha ho le joalo, ho molemo ho nahana.
That is your decision.	Ke qeto ya hao eo.
Like the others.	Joalo ka tse ling.
And why people do it.	Le hore na ke hobane'ng ha batho ba e etsa.
The man seems happy with that question.	Monna o bonahala a thabetse potso eo.
But you can do it.	Empa u ka li etsa.
I knew it would be so.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ho tla ba joalo.
I will be doing things from here on out.	Ke tla be ke etsa lintho ho tloha mona ho ea pele.
He had just been injured.	O ne a sa tsoa kotsi.
I do not want to and I will leave you.	ha ke batle mme ke tla o tlohela.
We are working on it.	Re ntse re e sebetsa.
This was a lot of fun to read.	Sena se ne se monate haholo ho se bala.
I know the law.	Ke tseba molao.
Maybe it's better this way.	Mohlomong ho molemo ka tsela ena.
The longer it lasts, the better.	Ha nako e telele, ho molemo.
He lives in my area.	O lula sebakeng sa ka.
You have to do one.	U lokela ho etsa e le 'ngoe.
I will try again next week to do this.	Ke tla leka hape bekeng e tlang ho etsa sena.
You would expect to be an adult.	O tla lebella hore o be motho e moholo.
But it will take time.	Empa ho tla nka nako.
We still need your help.	Re ntse re hloka thuso ea hau.
This is good news and bad news.	Tsena ke litaba tse monate le tse mpe.
I am sure he will be fine.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o tla phela hantle.
But everything else seems to be good news.	Empa lintho tse ling kaofela li bonahala e le litaba tse monate.
Finally we looked at where we were.	Qetellong re ile ra sheba moo re neng re le teng.
It was hard, but they had done it.	Ho ne ho le thata, empa ba ne ba e entse.
It makes us who we are.	E re etsa seo re leng sona.
I'm going to get it.	Ke il'o e fumana.
I'm sure he would.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o ne a tla etsa joalo.
It says exactly what you think it means.	E bolela hantle seo o nahanang hore e se bolela.
Emotions are a form of emotion.	Maikutlo ke mofuta o itseng oa maikutlo.
I do not know you either.	Le nna ha ke o tsebe.
I know we need to let go of it.	Kea tseba hore re hloka ho o tlohela.
They returned home early, tired.	Ba ile ba khutlela hae esale pele, ba khathetse.
That makes it even more painful.	Seo se etsa hore ho be bohloko le ho feta.
They just look at the time.	Ba mpa ba sheba nako feela.
Then the pain he felt was just one person.	Joale bohloko boo a ileng a bo utloa e ne e le motho e mong a le mong.
So we did.	Kahoo re ile ra etsa joalo.
They look great.	Li shebahala hantle.
He went to work and did not return home until that night.	O ile a ea mosebetsing 'me ha aa ka a khutlela hae ho fihlela bosiung boo.
Does it "help" her if she cries?	Na e "mo thusa" haeba a lla?
He could not have lived long without others.	O ne a ke ke a phela nako e telele ntle le ba bang.
He took it all.	O e nkile kaofela.
We talked a lot about it.	Re ile ra bua haholo ka eona.
A few days maybe.	Matsatsi a 'maloa mohlomong.
Yes, it does work.	E, e ea sebetsa.
But it does not seem to work.	Empa ha e bonahale e sebetsa.
I really enjoyed all that time.	Ke ile ka thabela nako eo kaofela haholo.
That he needed her as much as he needed her.	Hore o ne a mo hloka haholo kamoo a neng a mo hloka kateng.
I could not pass.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho feta.
Suppose that works.	Nka hore seo sea sebetsa.
It usually works.	Hangata e ea sebetsa.
I decided to give it a try.	Ke entse qeto ea ho fana ka eona ka sebele.
To do it.	Ho e etsa.
It is your husband's last request.	Ke kopo ea ho qetela ea monna oa hao.
And we are.	'Me re joalo.
You did not know your location.	O ne o sa tsebe sebaka sa hao.
Why should you know?	Ke hobane'ng ha u lokela ho tseba?
He did nothing of that.	Ha A etsa letho la seo.
But it really isn't that hard.	Empa ha e le hantle ha e thata hakaalo.
We are not in many of them.	Ha re eo ho tse ngata tsa tsona.
If there is a problem, the police come quickly.	Ha bothata bo le teng, mapolesa a tla kapele.
He talked to her about his life.	O ile a bua le eena ka bophelo ba hae.
Who would not?	Ke mang ea neng a ke ke a etsa joalo?
We will play again.	Re tla bapala hape.
He could not work it fast enough.	O ne a sa khone ho e sebetsa kapele ho lekana.
They wanted something new.	Ba ne ba batla ntho e ncha.
We hope you enjoy it !.	Re tšepa hore u tla e thabela!.
Some bad stuff, too.	Lintho tse ling tse mpe, le tsona.
Maybe there's something wrong with the back.	Mohlomong ho na le phoso e itseng ka morao.
We played hard.	Re ile ra bapala ka thata.
They wanted his life.	Ba ne ba batla bophelo ba hae.
So you have to keep trying.	Kahoo u lokela ho lula u leka.
You have to love others a little bit to have what you love.	U tlameha ho rata ba bang hanyane hore u be le seo u se ratang.
It was useless.	Ho ne ho se na thuso.
Well, he better not have it.	Be, ho molemo hore a se be le eona.
I know not much.	Kea tseba ha e ngata.
So, be careful.	Kahoo, hlokomela.
You can do what you want with him.	U ka etsa seo u se batlang le eena.
You may be one of them.	E ka ’na eaba u e mong oa bona.
It's no use.	Ha ho na thuso.
Coffee did not happen.	Kofi ha e ea etsahala.
However, I no longer care about pain.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke sa na taba le bohloko.
We had a great time.	Re bile le nako e monate.
We wanted to do this.	Re ne re batla ho etsa ntho ena.
Yet at the same time kind of good.	Leha ho le joalo ka nako e tšoanang mofuta o motle.
At the same time there was nothing like it.	Ka nako e tšoanang ho ne ho se letho le tšoanang.
They met.	Ba ile ba kopana.
Somehow both of them saw it.	Ka tsela e itseng ka bobeli ba ile ba e bona.
I did not know more.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ho feta.
I have a job to do now.	Ke na le mosebetsi oa ho etsa hona joale.
There was no one by name.	Ho ne ho se motho ea nang le lebitso.
It happens every day.	E etsahala letsatsi le letsatsi.
We have to do better than this.	Re tlameha ho etsa betere ho feta mona.
I just learned from him.	Ke sa tsoa ithuta ho eena.
In fact, you know nothing.	Ka 'nete, ha u tsebe letho.
I have a good job.	Ke na le mosebetsi o motle.
The great advantage of this is that it is long.	Molemo o moholo oa sena ke hore o telele.
And we need to know this.	Mme re hloka ho tseba sena.
But that is not exactly what happened.	Empa ha se hantle kamoo ho etsahetseng kateng.
That was not the case.	E ne e se lebaka leo.
I will do my work, though you will not do your own thing.	Ke tla etsa mosebetsi oa ka, le hoja u ke ke ua etsa oa hao.
Of course, say nothing more than yes.	Ha e le hantle, u se ke ua bua letho ho feta e.
He was clear.	O ne a hlakile.
He was the best.	E ne e le eena ea molemo.
There he will go and work well.	Moo a tla ea 'me o sebetsa hantle.
This is where the real problem lies.	Mona ke moo bothata ba sebele bo leng teng.
I really needed that money.	Ke ne ke hloka chelete eo haholo.
It is better not to think about anything.	Ho molemo ho se nahane ka letho.
It will not be easy.	Ho ka se be bonolo.
In a way, he always was.	Ka tsela e itseng, o ne a lula a le joalo.
He got that in the first week.	O ile a fumana seo bekeng ya pele.
Last night was the first.	Maobane bosiu e bile ea pele.
My mother also can't get enough.	'M'e le eena ha a khone ho fumana tse lekaneng.
We will be back tomorrow.	Re tla khutla hosane.
I would ask you to talk to them.	Ke ne ke tla u kopa hore u bue le bona.
I didn't want it.	Ke ne ke sa e batle.
I will tell them.	Ke tla ba bolella.
And I will never know if I will ever sleep again.	'Me nke ke ka tseba hore na ke tla robala hape.
Power be with you.	Matla a be le wena.
He was very happy when he thought about the party.	O ne a thabile haholo ha a nahana ka mokete.
There was nobody there.	Ho ne ho se motho moo.
I thought a lot about it.	Ke ile ka nahana haholo ka eona.
Maybe it's not such a good idea now to think about it.	Mohlomong ha se mohopolo o motle hakana joale ho nahana ka eona.
There was no way to start the day.	Ho ne ho se mokhoa oa ho qala letsatsi.
He just kept looking at her.	A nna a mo sheba feela.
I really feel that way.	Ka sebele ke ikutloa joalo.
Live life.	Phela bophelo.
And now he knew what it was.	Mme jwale o ne a tseba hore na ke eng.
Just trying it out.	Ho o leka feela.
It's too close.	E haufi haholo.
I didn't like to hear about it.	Ke ne ke sa rate ho utloa ka eona.
I will talk to them.	Ke tla bua le bona.
I will not keep you long on your job.	Nke ke ka o boloka nako e telele mosebetsing wa hao.
I meant.	Ke ne ke bolela.
I do not understand.	ha ke sa utloisisa.
Then a few more.	Ebe tse ling tse seng kae.
But many did.	Empa ba bangata ba ile ba etsa joalo.
But, it goes beyond that.	Empa, e feta moo.
I enjoyed doing so.	Ke ile ka thabela ho etsa joalo.
I feel down with my hands.	Ke utloa fatše ka matsoho a ka.
I refused to have anything.	Ke ile ka hana ho ba le letho.
We can talk about anything.	Re ka bua ka eng kapa eng.
I do not understand what is happening.	Ha ke utloisise se etsahalang.
Many people want to believe that he was.	Batho ba bangata ba batla ho lumela hore o ne a le joalo.
It's actually very simple.	Ha e le hantle e bonolo haholo.
That was probably a mistake.	Eo mohlomong e neng e le phoso.
But here's another one that might be useful.	Empa mona ke e 'ngoe e ka bang molemo.
It's happening, right now.	Ho a etsahala, hona jwale.
We had to watch it at school.	Re ne re tlameha ho e shebella sekolong.
He read late into the night.	O ile a bala ho fihlela bosiu haholo.
You just work for me.	U mpa u sebetsa bakeng sa ka.
Tell him to go.	Mo bolelle hore a tsamaee.
If you suspect you have.	Haeba u belaela hore u na le.
I just want them home.	Ke mpa ke ba batla hae.
I asked his name.	Ke ile ka botsa lebitso la hae.
This room was empty.	Kamore ena e ne e se na letho.
Where should we start?	Re lokela ho qala hokae?
We are strong.	Re matla.
He kept the house.	O ne a boloka ntlo.
Maybe it wasn’t his party.	Mohlomong e ne e se mokete oa hae.
I want to know that she will be fine.	Ke batla ho tseba hore o tla phela hantle.
Such a thing could never have happened.	Ntho e joalo e ne e ke ke ea e-ba e kileng ea e-ba teng.
There was no time.	Ho ne ho eso be le nako.
Anywhere near you.	Kapa kae kapa kae haufi le uena.
And one, and one.	Le e 'ngoe, le e 'ngoe.
That will be hard to find.	Tseo ho tla ba thata ho li fumana.
So you will stay together.	Kahoo le tla lula hammoho.
It's just hard.	E thata feela.
So, will you come with me?	Kahoo, u tla tla le nna?
This group usually lives longer than it has.	Hangata sehlopha sena se phela ho feta seo se nang le sona.
There is no point in this.	Ha ho na molemo ho sena.
Probably not good.	Mohlomong ha e ntle.
So maybe.	Kahoo mohlomong.
I know this is not news for many.	Kea tseba hore sena ha se litaba ho ba bangata.
But this was more than any of them had ever seen before.	Empa sena se ne se feta leha e le mang oa bona a kileng a se bona pele.
He did not even try to look at the picture.	Ha aa ka a leka le ho sheba setšoantšo seo.
There is only space in front of me.	Ho na le sebaka feela ka pele ho nna.
That's the way of life here.	Ke tsela ya bophelo mona.
Kids love to play with toys.	Bana ba rata ho bapala ka lintho tsa ho bapala.
Make sure the cable gives them enough strong starting point.	Etsa bonnete ba hore mohala o ba fa sebaka se matla se lekaneng sa ho qala.
The pain returned.	Bohloko bo ile ba khutla.
We probably do not know anything about its contents.	Mohlomong ha re tsebe letho ka litaba tsa eona.
I saw that once.	Ke ile ka bona seo hang.
I will give you the first type.	Ke tla u fa mofuta oa pele.
However, it would have been much better.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ka be ho bile betere haholo.
We have to move fast.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea kapele.
I just did.	Ke entse feela.
No one could question that.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a ka belaela seo.
It could not stand.	E ne e sitoa ho ema.
Another three years.	Lilemo tse ling tse tharo.
It needs to happen.	E hloka ho etsahala.
Yes, we do eat there, because the food is delicious.	E, re ntse re ja moo, hobane lijo li monate.
I like new things.	Ke rata lintho tse ncha.
We certainly have it.	Ka sebele re na le eona.
But so was her father.	Empa le ntate oa hae le eena o ne a le joalo.
I love that you are able to work.	Ke rata hore o khona ho sebetsa.
Nothing like that before.	Ha ho letho le neng le le joalo ka pele.
We did not know what to do.	Re ne re sa tsebe hore na re etse eng.
Not good.	Ha e ntle.
I'm just playing.	Ke bapala feela.
To me it was a good thing so far.	Ho 'na e ne e le taba e ntle ho fihlela joale.
He seems to have a very good one.	Ho bonahala eka o na le e ntle haholo.
Stay home.	U lule hae.
He asked what else there was.	O ile a botsa hore na ho na le eng hape.
It probably would not be the last.	Mohlomong e ka be e se ea ho qetela.
I didn't see it coming.	Ke ne ke sa e bone e tla.
You don’t do it because you think it will be fun.	Ha u e etse hobane u nahana hore e tla ba monate.
They will make food for us.	Ba tla re etsetsa lijo.
It's just weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang feela.
It was not his business, of course.	E ne e se taba ea hae, ka 'nete.
It was not water.	E ne e se metsi.
First, last time.	Lekhetlo la pele, la ho qetela.
Or they are.	Kapa ba ntse ba.
Thanks for picking up my phone.	Ke leboha ho nka mohala oa ka.
That was certainly not his style.	Ruri eo e ne e se mokhoa oa hae.
So the first issue is why.	Kahoo taba ea pele ea hore na ke hobane'ng.
He really has to go to school.	O tlameha ho ea sekolong ka 'nete.
Everyone seemed to have to comment.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka bohle ba tlameha ho fana ka maikutlo.
He no longer wanted to work.	O ne a se a sa batle ho sebetsa letho.
I really like it.	Ka sebele kea e rata.
We may need help now.	Re ka 'na ra hloka thuso hona joale.
After all, who knows?	Ho feta moo, ke mang ea tsebang?
I'm going to read that.	Ke ya bala seo.
I will never know.	Nke ke ka o tseba.
Maybe you think I’m real, maybe so.	Mohlomong u nahana hore ke 'na oa sebele, mohlomong ho joalo.
He was about to turn thirty.	O ne a le haufi le ho qeta lilemo tse mashome a mararo.
Like all other people.	Joalo ka batho ba bang kaofela.
I did not know if anyone had done that.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ho na le motho ea entseng joalo.
It had to be easy.	E ne e lokela ho ba bonolo.
The real issue here is another one.	Taba ea sebele mona ke e ’ngoe.
We spent a long time looking for that house.	Re ile ra qeta nako e telele re ntse re batla ntlo eo.
The only question is soon.	Potso feela ke hore na haufinyane.
That’s what you do.	Ke ka seo u se etsang.
Not so good with people.	Ha e ntle hakaalo le batho.
It's just me.	Ke 'na feela.
I do not know if it still exists.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e ntse e le teng.
I want to be human.	Ke batla ho ba motho.
So he does it with everyone else.	Kahoo o e etsa le ba bang kaofela.
Not at all.	Ho hang ha ho joalo.
I passed for the first time.	Ke ile ka feta lekhetlo la pele.
He thought that was fun.	O ne a nahana hore seo se monate.
But just about that.	Empa hoo e ka bang feela.
You would never know he had it.	U ne u ke ke ua tseba hore o na le eona.
We do a lot of things together.	Re etsa lintho tse ngata hammoho.
I'm just going.	Ke tsamaea feela.
Now is my chance.	Joale ke monyetla oa ka.
I did not say this.	Ha kea bua sena.
Probably some of them.	Mohlomong tse ling tsa tsona.
I had it a day later.	Ke ile ka ba le eona ka mor'a letsatsi.
There is nothing else he can do.	Ha ho letho le leng leo a ka le etsang.
She was crying, very hard.	O ne a lla, ka thata haholo.
Everyone was there for the party.	Bohle ba ne ba le teng moketeng oo.
He knows he has no chance.	O a tseba hore ha a na monyetla.
However, I do not have time to do it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke na nako ea ho e etsa.
When he got to it, he knew why.	Ha a fihla ho eona, o ne a tseba lebaka.
He only does his own thing in his own time.	O etsa ntho tsa hae feela ka nako ya hae.
They help them.	Ba ba thusa.
You were tired.	U ne u khathetse.
They have done this for a long time.	Ba entse sena ka nako e telele.
And it works for me.	Mme e sebetsa ho nna.
That's a good thing about this.	Ke ntho e monate ka sena.
Which do you like best?	Ke efe eo u e ratang haholo?
Who no one wanted.	Eo ho neng ho se motho ea e batlang.
It just goes in.	E kena feela.
It hurts a lot.	Ho bohloko haholo.
There were a few things he enjoyed most.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse seng kae tseo a neng a li thabela ho feta.
He just came out.	O ile a tsoa feela.
He has a home.	O na le hae.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
However, he has not left yet.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a e-s'o tsamaee.
But we can never know for sure.	Empa re ke ke ra tseba hantle.
You would have said you knew.	O ka be o itse o a tseba.
You work very hard.	U sebetsa ka thata haholo.
Count, read, read.	Bala, bala, bala.
He just didn't want to.	O ne a sa batle feela.
However, if you can go, you must return.	Leha ho le joalo, haeba u ka ea, u tlameha ho khutla.
But there was nothing he could do.	Empa ho ne ho se seo a ka se etsang.
The work was hard.	Mosebetsi o ne o le boima.
I thought it would pass.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e tla feta.
It's a very difficult field.	Ke lebala le thata haholo.
Not all issues are there.	Ha se litaba tsohle tse teng.
Yes, it was.	E, e ne e le teng.
This solved the problem.	Sena se ile sa lokisa bothata.
I would love to say whatever you like, you know.	Ke tla thabela ho bua eng kapa eng eo o e ratang, ua tseba.
Be that as it may.	Eba jwalo.
And by then, it will be too late !.	Mme ka nako eo, e tla be e se e le morao haholo!.
And so it is.	Mme ho jwalo.
He will give all he has.	O tla fana ka tsohle tseo a nang le tsona.
You can enjoy the ride.	U ka thabela ho palama.
Clearly, he had difficulty walking.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a na le bothata ba ho tsamaea.
We need to get together.	Re hloka ho kopana.
It exists, it cannot leave, it exists.	E teng, e ke ke ea tloha, e teng.
Think of your dog.	Nahana ka ntja ea hau.
He is clearly not their boyfriend.	Ho hlakile hore ha se mohlankana oa bona.
However, not one of them was there for him.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a le teng bakeng sa hae.
Must be? 	Ho joalo?
I hope you are not gone yet!	Ke tšepa hore ha u e-so tsamaee!
It was not what was outside.	E ne e se le se neng se le ka ntle.
And those are about three.	Mme tseo e ka ba tse tharo.
I try to be myself.	Ke leka ho ba 'na feela.
He thought about this opportunity.	O ile a nahana ka monyetla ona.
It talks a lot about them.	E bua haholo ka bona.
He's coming back '.	O ntse a khutla'.
But that's all old news.	Empa seo sohle ke litaba tsa khale.
The child could understand it.	Ngoana o ne a ka e utloisisa.
As we both knew we only had it.	Joalo ka ha ka bobeli re ne re tseba hore re na le eona feela.
It only takes a long time.	Ho nka nako e telele feela.
He noticed a number of things as he walked.	O ile a hlokomela lintho tse ’maloa ha a ntse a tsamaea.
We went to the same high school.	Re ile ra kena sekolo se le seng se phahameng.
You can specify the method you want.	U ka bolela mokhoa oo u o batlang.
I'm still somewhere.	Ke ntse ke le sebakeng se seng.
They know that people will buy.	Baa tseba hore batho ba tla reka.
However, we could work on that.	Leha ho le joalo, re ne re ka sebetsa ho seo.
However, literally.	Leha ho le joalo, ka mokhoa oa sebele.
I was not expecting to write.	Ke ne ke sa lebella ho ngola.
Old, new, true friends.	Metsoalle ea khale, e ncha, ea 'nete.
Can he.	Na a ka khona.
But you spent a lot of time together.	Empa le ile la qeta nako e ngata le le hammoho.
I was a woman.	Ke ne ke le mosali.
However, I do not believe it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke e lumele.
But there was a danger.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le kotsi.
But from there he goes out.	Empa ho tloha moo oa tsoa.
You know the problem.	U tseba bothata.
I want to know about your family.	Ke batla ho tseba ka lelapa la hau.
Unless you want to talk about who you are, who you are.	Ntle le haeba u batla ho bua ka uena, hore na u mang.
It goes on and on.	E ntse e tsoela pele.
That was bad news.	E ne e le litaba tse mpe tseo.
Get another one.	Fumana e 'ngoe.
Life is always good.	Bophelo bo dula bo le monate.
They began to think about difficult questions.	Ba ile ba qala ho nahana ka lipotso tse thata.
The question now is whether they will actually do so.	Potso joale ke hore na ba hlile ba tla etsa joalo.
I don't know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke eng.
It will continue to be so.	Ho tla tsoela pele ho ba joalo.
And find out what it means to you.	Le ho fumana hore na e bolela eng ho uena.
I was walking and talking, talking and walking.	Ke ne ke tsamaea le ho bua, ho bua le ho tsamaea.
That simply means not being able to pay for it.	Seo se bolela feela ho sitoa ho lefa tsela ea eona.
He told us that.	O re boleletse seo.
Find things you like.	Fumana lintho tseo u li ratang.
Let's do it.	Ha re e etse.
Such people.	Batho ba joalo.
I'm sorry at first.	Ke masoabi pele.
You know exactly why.	U tseba hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
He said it that way.	O ne a e bolela ka tsela eo.
I could not see it clearly.	Ke ne ke sa e bone hantle.
He knew he didn't want it.	O ne a tseba hore ha a e batle.
People keep coming every day.	Batho ba nna ba tla letsatsi le letsatsi.
I know that my parents see it that way.	Kea tseba hore batsoali ba ka ba bona joalo.
We will do it.	Re tla e etsa.
Children, family, what good.	Bana, lelapa, molemo ke ofe.
That's right.	Ke 'nete eo.
Not only that.	Hase feela.
They left the party early.	Ba ile ba tloha moketeng pele ho nako.
It should be simple.	E lokela ho ba bonolo.
In fact, this work was the last one.	Ha e le hantle, mosebetsi ona e ne e le oa ho qetela.
Eng.	Eng.
What they want instead, is a guilty person.	Seo ba se batlang ho e-na le hoo, ke motho ea molato.
I certainly felt that way.	Ka sebele ke ne ke utloile joalo.
How do you say it.	U e bua joang.
What a man.	Monna ea joang.
However, that is not really the case.	Leha ho le joalo, seo hase ’nete ruri.
And it was fun.	'Me ho ne ho e-na le monate.
I knew his mother very well.	Ke ne ke tseba ’mè oa hae hantle.
Tonight, you will find that opportunity.	Bosiung bona, o tla fumana monyetla oo.
It was fun.	Ho ne ho le monate.
He knew everything and had nothing.	O ne a tseba tsohle mme a se na letho.
They saved time and energy.	Ba ile ba boloka nako le matla.
That doesn't make it any better.	Seo ha se etse hore ho be betere.
However, this cannot be true.	Leha ho le joalo, sena e ke ke ea e-ba 'nete.
I was not thinking of anything else.	Ke ne ke sa nahane letho le leng.
What was his name?	Lebitso la hae e ne e le mang?
There is only one way out for me, he said.	Ho na le tsela e le 'ngoe feela ea ho tsoa bakeng sa ka, a re.
You can certainly do better than that.	Ka sebele u ka etsa hantle ho feta moo.
It is three times the size of ours.	E lekana le ea rōna ka makhetlo a mararo.
He had never done that.	O ne a eso etse le hoo.
It really belongs to my father.	Ha e le hantle ke ea Ntate.
They never had each other.	Le ka mohla ba ne ba se na mong ho e mong.
Yet he helped her.	Leha ho le joalo a mo thusa.
I would appreciate some help here.	Ke tla thabela thuso e 'ngoe mona.
It returns true if so.	E khutlela 'nete haeba ho le joalo.
That worked very well.	Seo se ile sa sebetsa haholo.
For me, it’s both.	Ho 'na, ke bobeli.
I stood up.	Ka ema ka maoto.
But it came back.	Empa e ile ea khutla.
Only, the news is true too.	Feela, litaba ke 'nete hape.
This is definitely a very good book.	Ruri ena ke buka e ntle haholo.
The others stopped.	Ba bang ba ile ba ema.
I will continue to do so.	Ke tla tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
Their children are our children.	Bana ba bona ke bana ba rona.
They have power.	Ba na le matla.
Probably not important.	Mohlomong ha li bohlokoa.
That is not enough.	Seo ha sea lekana.
They thought it might be one.	Ba ne ba nahana hore e ka ba e mong.
We said so.	Re ile ra bua joalo.
Please find this out.	Ke kopa o fumane sena.
Very good, indeed.	E ntle haholo, ka 'nete.
Because he exists.	Hobane o teng.
We want to keep trying.	Re batla ho lula re leka.
If your friend does not know you, it is time to find a new one.	Haeba ea hau e sa e tsebe, ke nako ea ho fumana e ncha.
He wrote another letter.	O ile a ngola lengolo le leng.
That should help him a little.	Seo se lokela ho mo thusa hanyane.
I have never told anyone about them.	Ha ke eso bolelle motho ka tsona.
So if you want to see him, you can meet him here.	Kahoo haeba u batla ho mo bona, u ka kopana le eena mona.
Read more.	Bala haholoanyane.
They made me see it.	Ba entse hore ke e bone.
He could understand it very well.	O ne a ka e utloisisa hakaalo.
But they are not as beautiful as a person.	Empa ha ba ntle joalo ka motho.
Like a bad thing was waiting for us.	Joalo ka ntho e mpe e ne e re emetse.
We met a group of friends.	Re ile ra kopana le sehlopha sa metsoalle.
You see, we don't love you that much anymore.	Ua bona, ha re sa u rata hakaalo.
And they passed by.	Mme ba feta.
We know their status.	Re tseba boemo ba bona.
She was a woman he did not know.	E ne e le mosali eo a neng a sa mo tsebe.
That was the only way.	E ne e le eona feela tsela.
I knew then.	Ke ne ke tseba ka nako eo.
Would you not agree ?.	Na u ne u ke ke ua lumela?.
Worse than that.	E mpe haholo ho feta moo.
I want him to do it.	Ke batla hore a e etse.
I can't get another one.	Ha ke khone ho fihlela e 'ngoe.
However, no one wants them.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho ea li batlang.
I know a lot of people.	Ke tseba batho ba bangata.
He starts work very early in the morning.	O qala mosebetsi hoseng haholo.
While he was still alive, he asked for water.	A sa phela, a kopa metsi.
I certainly did nothing.	Ka sebele ha kea ka ka etsa letho.
I was not expecting to leave this place.	Ke ne ke sa lebella ho tsoa sebakeng sena.
There seemed to be a great opportunity here.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho na le monyetla o moholo mona.
I think they are.	Ke nahana hore ba joalo.
Things may not be going our way.	Ho ka etsahala hore lintho li se ke tsa tsamaea ka tsela eo re neng re li batla ka eona.
I can still hear you.	Ke ntse ke o utloa.
Of course, you have to pay with your real money.	Ha e le hantle, u lokela ho lefa ka chelete ea hau ea sebele.
You have found this.	Sena o se fumane.
I'm close.	Ke haufi.
So we never did.	Kahoo ha ho mohla re kileng ra.
Of course, no, it is not.	Ha e le hantle, che, ha ho joalo.
This can be anything.	Sena e ka ba eng kapa eng.
That's the problem.	Ke bothata boo.
He talks a lot about his work.	O bua haholo ka mosebetsi oa hae.
You can live only three days without water.	U ka phela matsatsi a mararo feela ntle le metsi.
My father asked if there was a way to do it quickly.	Ntate o ile a botsa hore na ho na le tsela ea ho e etsa kapele.
I did not know the room.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe kamore eo.
That is their job and they both do it well.	Oo ke mosebetsi oa bona 'me bobeli ba bona ba o etsa hantle.
There was no one to do it.	Ho ne ho se motho ya ka e etsang.
We had a great time.	Re bile le nako e monate.
It was simple, but beautiful.	E ne e le bonolo, empa e ntle.
I think he is.	Ke nahana hore ke eena.
We have to play with what we have.	Re tlameha ho bapala ka seo re nang le sona.
However, he would stand.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a tla ema.
It was the only one he read.	Ke eona feela eo a ileng a e bala.
He is.	O joalo.
I like it.	Kea e rata.
He loves power.	O rata matla.
He had finally found it.	Qetellong o ne a e fumane.
I can do that, no problem.	Nka etsa seo, haho bothata.
But it is still there.	Empa e ntse e le teng.
It was not easy to talk.	Ho ne ho se bonolo le ho bua.
I am in good health.	Ke ntse ke phela hantle.
My children are gentle.	Bana ba ka ba bonolo.
Or maybe you do not.	Kapa mohlomong ha u etse joalo.
Most were good, but not very good.	Tse ngata li ne li le ntle, empa li ne li se ntle haholo.
It was the same dinner.	E ne e le lijo tsa mantsiboea tse tšoanang.
Soon we will pass here.	Haufinyane re tla feta mona.
Many people found it hard to believe.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba fumana ho le thata ho lumela.
But now you know that it is not always easy.	Empa joale ua tseba hore ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
You make us keep thinking.	U etsa hore re lule re nahana.
Every day.	Letsatsi le letsatsi.
He refused to speak.	O ile a hana ho bua.
I would work harder.	Ke ne ke tla sebetsa ho feta.
You had to do what you did.	U ne u tlameha ho etsa seo u se entseng.
That is what will happen.	Ke se tla etsahala.
I didn't want to tell you.	Ke ne ke sa rate ho o bolella.
But he did not notice.	Empa ha aa ka a hlokomela.
We talked about a lot of things.	Re ile ra bua ka lintho tse ngata.
Her parents did not hear.	Batsoali ba hae ha baa ka ba utloa.
You will just have to watch and see.	U tla tlameha feela ho shebella le ho bona.
But we have, and we can.	Empa re na le, 'me re ka khona.
That's what we do.	Ke ntho eo re e etsang.
Everything starts with power.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e qala ka matla.
Many of us loved him dearly.	Ba bangata ba rōna re ne re mo rata haholo.
I like that!.	Ke rata seo!.
I used to work hard.	Ke tloaetse ho sebetsa ka thata.
In three hours. 	Ka lihora tse tharo. 
We only have minds when we have no emotions.	Re na le kelello feela ha re se na maikutlo.
However, it is a good job.	Leha ho le joalo, ke mosebetsi o motle.
Doing this is as dangerous as it is.	Ho etsa sena ho kotsi joalo ka ha ho le joalo.
I think something is happening.	Ke nahana hore ho na le ntho e etsahalang.
It was me.	Ke ne ke le nna.
So, go back.	Kahoo, khutlela morao.
This is too much.	Sena se ngata haholo.
Morning coffee time.	Hoseng nako ea kofi.
His hands were missing.	Matsoho a hae a ne a le sieo.
I was beginning to doubt.	Ke ne ke qala ho belaela.
He did not know.	O ne a sa tsebe.
As they work for you.	Ha ba ntse ba sebetsa ho uena.
No, not at all.	Che, ha ho joalo haholo.
One could not just love them.	Motho o ne a ke ke a ba rata feela.
I was really looking forward to it.	Ke ne ke hlile ke e lebeletse.
He knows he is wrong.	O a tseba hore o etsa phoso.
Someone knew what it looked like.	E mong o ne a tseba hore na e shebahala joang.
I can tell them why.	Nka ba bolella lebaka.
He did the same.	Le eena o ile a etsa joalo.
It was the same with everything else.	Ho ne ho le joalo le ka tse ling tsohle.
It was the first time I had seen anything like it.	Ke ne ke qala ho bona ntho e kang ena.
A few more hours passed.	Ho ile ha feta lihora tse ling tse ’maloa.
You say so.	U re ho joalo.
In fact, those who love you will suffer even more.	Ha e le hantle, ba ratang ho feta ba tla utloa bohloko le ho feta.
Don't feel like you need to.	U se ke ua ikutloa eka u hloka.
See you.	Ke tla u bona.
They move by hand.	Li tsamaea ka matsoho.
I have said nothing.	Ha ke so bue letho.
He sang the most beautiful song.	O ile a bina ha monate ka ho fetisisa.
I know that very well.	Ke tseba seo hantle haholo.
Then something amazing happened.	Eaba ho etsahala ntho e makatsang.
She knew it, and she loved it because of it.	O ne a e tseba, ’me a mo rata ka lebaka la eona.
That was not the case.	Ho ne ho se joalo.
Amazing stuff right there.	Lintho tse makatsang hona moo.
He got her or had to call, whatever.	O ile a mo fumana kapa a tlameha ho letsa, eng kapa eng.
You can use any of them you like.	U ka sebelisa leha e le efe ea tsona eo u e ratang.
You know you don't have to be here.	Ua tseba ha ua lokela ho ba mona.
Production is always working.	Tlhahiso e lula e sebetsa.
I don’t think it can be that hard.	Ha ke nahane hore ho ka ba thata hakaalo.
I think that was the worst time ever.	Ke nahana hore eo e ne e le nako e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
You try harder and harder every day.	U leka ka matla le ho feta letsatsi le letsatsi.
He loves it here.	O e rata mona.
Then he found what he was looking for.	Eaba o fumana seo a neng a se batla.
But it did happen.	Empa ho ile ha etsahala.
For it, there is nothing.	Bakeng sa eona, ha ho na letho.
Someone was calling her.	Ho na le motho ea neng a mo letsetsa.
Now, as long as you can do that.	Jwale, ha feela o ka etsa jwalo.
Then you need to talk to someone for that.	Ebe o lokela ho bua le motho bakeng sa seo.
I never heard from again.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke utloa.
He could never do that.	Ha ho mohla a neng a ka etsa joalo.
Tell her that you will be there.	Bolella mme hore o tla ba teng.
But we had a wonderful time.	Empa re bile le nako e monate feela.
He spoke emotionally.	A bua ka maikutlo.
We are very happy.	Re thabile haholo.
I like to do that.	Ke rata ho etsa joalo.
It's yours, you're mine.	Ke oa hau, u oa ka.
They all have the same image.	Bohle ba na le setšoantšo se tšoanang.
He will give her that, she will give him whatever he wants.	O tla mo fa seo, o tla mo fa eng kapa eng eo a e batlang.
Of course it would have been nice to see more of her.	Ehlile ho ka be ho bile monate ho bona tse ngata tsa hae.
But everyone has it.	Empa bohle ba na le eona.
I wanted to pass.	Ke ne ke batla ho feta.
These are just some of the goal setting shareware that you can use.	Tsena ke tse ling tsa tseo u hlokang ho li utloisisa.
Just the way.	Tsela feela.
Yes, he was dangerous.	E, o ne a le kotsi.
To most, nothing was clear.	Ho ba bangata ha ho letho le neng le hlakile.
This can be a fun way to play.	Ena e ka ba mokhoa o monate oa ho bapala.
Only, he did not have enough time.	Feela, o ne a se na nako e lekaneng.
Most likely you will.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe u tla etsa joalo.
It really is important.	E hlile ke ea bohlokoa.
In the area.	Sebakeng.
He wants to look at it.	O batla ho o sheba.
After this he did not wish her.	Ka mor'a sena ha aa ka a mo lakatsa.
Life is simple.	Bophelo bo bonolo.
I have never used it yet.	Ha ke so ka ke e sebelisa ho fihlela joale.
We did not speak for days.	Re ile ra qeta matsatsi re sa bue.
They’re playing together more.	Ba ntse ba bapala hammoho ho feta.
They just let it go.	Ba ile ba e tlohela feela.
And it is not.	'Me ha ho joalo.
So they ask.	Kahoo baa botsa.
You have been working on it for a long time.	Ke khale u sebetsa ho eona.
Then you say yes to one of them, not to the others.	Joale u re e ho e mong oa bona, che ho ba bang.
It can be the same with you.	Ho ka ba joalo le ho uena.
I'll see that.	Ke tla bona seo.
He may have found this or he may know it.	E ka 'na eaba o fumane sena kapa a se tseba.
You still have a chance to survive.	U ntse u e-na le monyetla oa ho phela.
He did a great job indeed.	O entse mosebetsi o moholo ruri.
That's simple.	Ke tseo tse bonolo.
You will be too late to drive anywhere today.	U tla be u le morao haholo ho khanna kae kapa kae kajeno.
Everything	Ntho ka 'ngoe
They made no suggestion.	Ha ba ka ba etsa tlhahiso ya letho.
If anything can happen now.	Haeba ho na le ntho e ka etsahalang hona joale.
If he did, you would know.	Ha a ne a ka etsa jwalo, o ne o tla tseba.
You can buy them.	U ka li reka.
Both of them.	Ka bobeli ba tsona.
Please believe that.	Ke kopa o lumele seo.
But she wonders.	Empa oa ipotsa.
Eventually he could no longer stand.	Qetellong ha a ka a hlola a khona ho ema.
She could not let go of him.	O ne a sitoa ho mo tlohela.
It's easier than that.	Ho bonolo ho feta.
We do not need to see anyone else.	Ha ho hlokahale hore re bone motho e mong.
He was not talking to anyone.	O ne a sa bue le mang kapa mang.
Come if you like.	Tlo ha o rata.
You do not have to do anything else.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u etse letho hape.
I enjoy that.	Ke thabela seo.
People were walking there on foot.	Batho ba ne ba tsamaea ka maoto moo.
The best are yet to come !.	Tse ntle ka ho fetisisa li sa tla!.
He could not believe this.	Sena a ka be a sa ka a se lumela.
So why did you do that? 	Joale ke hobane'ng ha u entse joalo?
However, it has been difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bile thata.
the boy asked.	moshanyana a botsa.
He will come with us.	O tla tla le rona.
I'm not sure about the question.	Ha ke na bonnete ka potso.
I am not for them.	Ha ke bakeng sa bona.
This, even today, is not the case.	Sena, le kajeno, ha se joalo.
They are too many people.	Ke batho ba bangata haholo.
I felt nice and tired.	Ke ne ke utloa ho le monate ho khathetse.
He asked her questions.	O ile a mo botsa lipotso.
Good news for me.	Litaba tse monate ho 'na.
We don't have that.	Ha re na seo.
They took us.	Ba re nkile.
How can you beat him?	U ka mo hlola joang.
The way we need it.	Ka tsela eo re e hlokang.
I see it all now.	Ke e bona kaofela hona joale.
I hope you have a great time here.	Ke tšepa hore u tla ba le nako e monate mona.
I'm not sure who said that before.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke mang ea buileng joalo pele.
I need that book.	Ke hloka buka eo.
And it worked, in the end.	Mme ya sebetsa, qetellong.
He eats breakfast	O ja lijo tsa hoseng hoseng
He must have had a reason to stand here.	E tlameha ebe o ne a e-na le lebaka la ho ema mona.
He has a name.	O na le lebitso.
Maybe someone knows better.	Mohlomong ho na le motho ea tsebang ho feta.
That's where they are tonight.	Ke hona moo ba leng teng bosiung bona.
You know she's beautiful.	O a tseba o motle.
And the hours went by.	'Me lihora li ile tsa tsamaea.
He did not understand.	O ne a sa utloisise.
And that is probably for the best.	'Me seo mohlomong ke bakeng sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
They were vigorously present.	Ba ne ba le teng ka matla.
He decided that he would have to leave.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore o tla tlameha ho tsamaea.
I have never seen it before.	Ha ke eso bone pele.
The biggest person was in the room.	Motho e moholo ka ho fetisisa o ne a le ka phaposing.
I hope you enjoy reading this book.	Ke tšepa hore u tla thabela ho bala buka ena.
And some of us are here today.	Mme ba bang ba rona re teng kajeno.
It would be better not to start without me, he thought.	Ho molemo hore ba se ke ba qala ntle le 'na, o ile a nahana.
There is no reason.	Ha ho na lebaka.
And for a long time nothing happened.	'Me ka nako e telele ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala.
I do it every day.	Ke etsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
I grabbed her.	Ke ile ka mo tšoara.
We must fix this issue.	Re tlameha ho lokisa taba ena.
Day by day.	Letsatsi ka letsatsi.
It had been home for so many years.	E ne e le hae ka lilemo tse ngata haholo.
He is there.	O teng moo.
Once you meet them, you will never forget them.	Hang ha u se u kopane le bona, u ke ke ua ba lebala.
He was like that when he was a child.	O ne a bile joalo le ha e sa le ngoana.
He has been in this profession for thirty years.	O bile mosebetsing ona ka lilemo tse mashome a mararo.
No one has ever done that, or ever since.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a etsa joalo, kapa ka mor'a moo.
They decided to stay where they were.	Ba ile ba etsa qeto ea ho lula moo ba neng ba le teng.
It doesn't matter.	Ha se letho la bohlokoa.
Anything can happen.	Ho ka etsahala eng kapa eng.
The car squeals and stops.	Koloi ea lla e ema.
He said it did not matter.	A re ha se taba.
Get out and do it.	Tloha 'me u e etse.
We are still human children.	Re ntse re le bana ba motho.
That is happening.	Seo se ntse se etsahala.
Of course, you can get hurt.	Ehlile, u ka tsoa kotsi.
It took days.	Ho ile ha nka matsatsi.
Maybe it would be better if he said nothing.	Mohlomong ho ka ba molemo ha a ka bua letho.
My mother, however, did this.	Leha ho le joalo, 'Mè o ile a etsa joalo.
However, that may not be enough.	Leha ho le joalo, hoo ho ka etsahala hore ebe ha ho sa lekana.
The woman told him that someone would come in.	Mosali eo o ile a mo bolella hore ho na le motho ea tla kena hantle.
We are alive.	Re phela.
Neither do we.	Le rōna ha re etse joalo.
Get out while you can.	Tsoa ha u ntse u khona.
I want to give it a chance.	Ke batla ho e fa monyetla.
Not so much.	Ha ho joalo haholo.
That was how they needed to talk.	E ne e le kamoo ba neng ba hloka ho bua kateng.
There are not many people like him.	Ha ho na batho ba bangata ba tšoanang le eena.
They walked.	Ba ne ba tsamaea ka maoto.
The truth lives in us.	'Nete e phela ka rona.
This is a dangerous call.	Ena ke mohala o kotsi.
They want to know, to live, to live a lifetime.	Ba batla ho tseba, ho phela, ho phela bophelo bohle.
I like a party.	Ke rata mokete.
He says nothing.	Ha a bue letho.
She cried and told me everything.	O ile a lla eaba o mpolella ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
Now it is too late.	Joale e se e le morao.
That would be fun.	Hoo ho ka ba monate.
But he needed to do so.	Empa o ne a hloka ho etsa joalo.
Think first, think only later.	Nahana pele, nahana feela ka morao.
Assume it is empty.	Nka hore ha e na letho.
People do not like him.	Batho ha ba mo rate.
If you have money, people will find you.	Haeba u na le chelete, batho ba tla u fumana.
Yes, yes, they will.	E, e, ho hlakile hore ba tla etsa joalo.
And that happens.	Mme hoo ho etsahala.
They stopped.	Ba ema.
I feel like a child.	Ke ikutloa joaloka ngoana.
But they are not the only ones.	Empa hase bona feela.
And he's going to fix it.	Mme o ya e lokisa.
But that was not the case.	Empa ho ne ho se joalo.
And it has been there ever since.	'Me e ntse e le teng ho tloha ka nako eo.
Well done !!.	O entse hantle!!.
It was time to make some money.	E ne e se e le nako ea ho fumana chelete.
Go back there.	Khutlela moo.
It must also work for both.	Hape e tlameha ho sebetsa ka bobeli.
It went, just like that.	E ile, joalo feela.
It's not gone yet.	Ha e so tsamaee.
He wanted to go.	O ne a batla ho tsamaea.
I have to get home.	Ke tlameha ho fihla hae.
Be better.	Eba betere.
Or me.	Kapa le nna.
Too bad, we know.	Ho mpe, rea tseba.
There must be something wrong with me.	Eka ho na le phoso ka 'na.
They are more emotional.	Ba na le maikutlo ho feta.
That time is not enough.	Nako eo ha ea lekana.
I ask him if he can come.	Kea mo botsa hore na a ka tla.
I had no idea what it was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke eng.
He needed to tell them everything.	O ne a hloka ho ba bolella ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
Good.	Molemo.
It helped a little too much.	E ile ea thusa hanyane haholo.
If it does not help you now, it will help you in the future.	Haeba e ke ke ea u thusa hona joale, e tla u thusa nakong e tlang.
No one asked.	Ha ho ea ileng a botsa.
The room was beautiful.	Kamore e ne e le ntle.
Soon you will see the house coming first.	Haufinyane u tla bona ntlo e tlang pele.
They are not people of the past.	Ha se batho ba nako e fetileng.
He heard.	O ile a utloa.
But it is a long way off.	Mme tsela e telele ruri.
Once it would have to do.	Hang e ne e tla tlameha ho etsa.
I was devastated.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko.
It's all yours.	Tsohle ke tsa hao.
Once there, you can find your people.	Ha u le moo, u ka fumana batho ba hau.
The decision was up to them.	Qeto e ne e le ho bona.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Ke masoabi ho utloa seo.
He lives in us.	Oa phela ho rona.
You may have seen someone walk now.	Mohlomong u bone motho a tsamaea hona joale.
But he was just beginning to get the idea.	Empa o ne a qala ho fumana mohopolo.
He said nothing more and it was not necessary.	Ha aa ka a bua letho hape mme ho ne ho sa hlokahale.
Man had his way.	Motho o ne a ena le tsela ya hae.
However, there is a reason for it.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le lebaka le itseng ho eona.
They work very hard.	Ba sebetsa haholo.
I doubt this.	Ke belaela sena.
Sometimes they don't seem to care.	Ka linako tse ling ho bonahala eka ha ba tsotelle.
We both tried.	Ka bobeli re ile ra leka.
They exploit us and make us their victims.	Baa re sebelisa, ebe baa re eka.
Either way, it will happen.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe, e tla etsahala.
But he is not dangerous.	Empa ha a kotsi.
And it works very well.	'Me e sebetsa hantle haholo.
He had time for everyone.	O ne a e-na le nako ea motho e mong le e mong.
They won in the end.	Ba ile ba hlola qetellong.
She was crying.	O ne a lla.
People are afraid of him.	Batho ba mo tšaba.
Or maybe they don't want to.	Kapa mohlomong ha ba batle.
Your life is yours, and they will not be mine.	Bophelo ba hao ke ba hao, mme ba ka ke ba ka.
Man to man.	Motho ho motho.
Get the same ideas.	Fumana maikutlo a tšoanang.
However, you should try.	Leha ho le joalo, o lokela ho leka.
You know the place.	Le tseba sebaka.
But he had one real opportunity.	Empa o ne a e-na le monyetla o le mong oa sebele.
He realized his mistake was too late.	O ile a hlokomela phoso ea hae e se e le morao haholo.
Maybe you're that kind.	Mohlomong u mofuta oo.
Yet he came in and visited her.	Leha ho le jwalo a kena mme a mo etela.
Also, find another way to get to school.	Hape, fumana tsela e 'ngoe ea ho ea sekolong.
But you did.	Empa u entse joalo.
But this way too long.	Empa ka tsela ena nako e telele haholo.
And children even more.	Mme bana le ho feta.
That was his job.	Oo e ne e le mosebetsi oa hae.
What was his name?	Lebitso la hae e ne e le mang .
I will never forget you.	Ke ne nke ke ka lebala ka uena.
They were behind us.	Ba ne ba le ka mora rona.
I just came to enjoy it, everyone.	Ke sa tsoa tla ho re thabela, bohle.
We only have today.	Re na le kajeno feela.
They used to be.	Ba kile ba ba teng.
His mind was empty.	Kelello ea hae e ne e se na letho.
Do not look at him.	U se ke ua mo sheba.
Same problem.	Bothata bo tšoanang.
I met the man several times.	Ke ile ka kopana le monna eo ka makhetlo a ’maloa.
Yet they stood still, doing nothing.	Leha ho le jwalo ba ema, ba sa etse letho.
He would do that.	O ne a tla etsa joalo.
I don't know where it came from.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e ne e tsoa hokae.
I wanted to talk.	Ke ne ke batla ho bua.
I didn't care about anyone.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle motho.
There had to be a way out of here.	Ho ne ho tlameha ho ba le tsela ea ho tloha mona.
That is nothing new.	Seo ha se ntho e ncha.
It is not hard to see why.	Ha ho thata ho bona lebaka.
That's what it comes to.	Ke seo e tlang ho sona.
The second time he has a name.	Lekhetlo la bobeli o na le lebitso.
But are they really.	Empa na ba hlile ba.
You have to get out.	U tlameha ho tsoa.
So that's what's important.	Kahoo ke seo e leng sa bohlokoa.
Which was bad.	E neng e le mpe.
This is one of those times.	Ena ke e 'ngoe ea linako tseo.
Soon with that, will you do so?	Kapele ka eona, na u tla etsa joalo?
I can't say he didn't come out.	Ha ke khone ho bolela hore ha aa ka a tsoa.
She is better than me.	A betere nna.
If he could find a way to continue.	Haeba a ne a ka fumana tsela ea ho tsoela pele.
I only know the place.	Ke tseba sebaka feela.
But you should not think too highly of me.	Empa ha oa lokela ho nahana hantle haholo ka nna.
That's what kids do.	Ke seo bana ba se etsang.
He gets home very late at night.	O fihla hae bosiu haholo.
Others write that they think it can be dangerous.	Ba bang bona ba ngola hore ba nahana hore ho ka ba kotsi.
They can't understand.	Ha ba khone ho utloisisa.
Here the danger is clear.	Mona kotsi e hlakile.
However, there are a number of problems.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le mathata a 'maloa.
He understood the reason.	O ne a utloisisa lebaka.
You take care of your feet.	Wena hlokomela maoto a hao.
A long-term condition can take a long time.	Boemo ba nako e telele bo ka nka nako e telele.
She's very, very good.	O hantle haholo, o hantle haholo.
True, yet not true.	Ke 'nete, leha ho le joalo e se 'nete.
The human thing.	Ntho ya motho.
Give the man a chance.	Fa monna monyetla.
Nothing like that has happened since then.	Ha ho letho le kang leo le etsahetseng ho tloha ka nako eo.
Thank you so much for dinner.	Ke leboha haholo ka lijo tsa mantsiboea.
Finally, we can go outside.	Qetellong, re ka ea sebakeng se ka ntle.
You don't see that happening.	Ha o bone seo se etsahala.
Finally, the car stopped.	Qetellong, koloi e ile ea ema.
Good things are very good.	Lintho tse ntle li ntle haholo.
I know what he wants.	Ke tseba seo a se batlang.
It is better not to let this happen.	Ho molemo hore re se ke ra lumella sena ho etsahala.
He looked bad.	O ne a shebahala a le mpe.
You can eat any time you want.	U ka ja nako efe kapa efe eo u batlang.
I will not enjoy it.	Nke ke ka e thabela.
So, it was fun.	Kahoo, ho ne ho le monate.
I did not expect that to happen.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore seo se tla etsahala.
Then you can use them.	Joale u ka li sebelisa.
His life, his work.	Bophelo ba hae, mosebetsi oa hae.
They need him.	Ba mo hloka.
It was empty.	E ne e se na letho.
We want to do it.	Re batla ho e etsa.
I have a question if you do not care.	Ke na le potso haeba u sa tsotelle.
I've been there many times.	Ke bile moo hangata.
I love them.	Kea ba rata.
The children were thrilled to return home.	Bana ba ne ba thabetse ho khutlela hae.
I don't understand anything after that.	Ha ke utloisise letho ka mor'a moo.
Nice to see you again.	Ho monate ho o bona hape.
They took their time to come right.	Ba nkile nako ea bona ho tla hantle.
Because he is here.	Hobane o teng mona.
They do not see him as a person.	Ha ba mo bone e le motho.
I will have one of them.	Ke tla ba le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
Stand back, please.	Ema ka morao, ka kopo.
I'm still waiting, for sure.	Ke ntse ke emetse, ka 'nete.
I do not know.	Ha ke tsebe.
I have a name.	Ke na le lebitso.
Here's to liking it.	Mona ke ho e rata.
I thought he was the easiest of them all.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o bonolo haholo ho tsona kaofela.
You are what you are and you are.	U seo u leng sona 'me ho joalo.
This is true, even if they are still not moving.	Sena ke 'nete, le haeba ba ntse ba sa tsamaee.
Life is so precious!	Bophelo ke ba bohlokoa haholo!
Meet and enjoy !.	Kopana le ho thabela!.
He considered her too dangerous.	O ne a mo nka a le kotsi haholo.
The new car is in the viewing room.	Koloi e ncha e ka kamoreng ea ho shebella.
There will be no one else.	Ha ho sa tla hlola ho eba le e mong.
This will always be you.	Sena se tla lula e le uena.
I have to make a decision soon.	Ke lokela ho nka qeto haufinyane.
It was good enough.	E ne e le ntle ho lekana.
It was my first time drinking.	E ne e le lekhetlo la ka la pele re noa.
We were in his bedroom.	Re ne re le ka kamoreng ea hae ea ho robala.
And to love him.	Le ho mo rata.
This is an opportunity.	Ke ona monyetla.
More news will come out.	Litaba tse ling li tla tsoa.
I had to leave quickly.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tsamaea kapele.
I do not like such a way of life.	Ha ke rate mokhoa o joalo oa bophelo.
I don't know what's wrong with me.	Ha ke tsebe hore na molato ke eng ka nna.
He did not intend to risk any harm.	O ne a sa rera kotsi leha e le efe.
However, sometimes.	Leha ho le joalo, ka linako tse ling.
Not much time.	Haho nako e ngata.
That we will do in the past.	Seo re tla se etsa nakong e fetileng.
I hope that helps, and thank you again!	Ke tšepa hore seo sea thusa, 'me kea leboha hape!
There are still problems.	Ho ntse ho na le mathata.
It looks very good.	E shebahala e le molemo haholo.
You want to thank everyone.	U batla ho leboha motho e mong le e mong.
And it can be.	Mme ho ka ba jwalo.
I still do.	Ke ntse ke etsa joalo.
I'm glad he's not there.	Ke thabela hore ebe ha a eo.
We must take care of our people.	Re lokela ho hlokomela batho ba rona.
I really don't know where that idea came from.	Ruri ha ke tsebe hore na mohopolo oo o o nkile kae.
I think this is true.	Ke nahana hore sena ke 'nete.
I have never seen any of that.	Ha ke so bone letho la tseo.
Want it.	E batle.
He was not there.	O ne a le sieo.
But all his children came.	Empa bana ba hae kaofela ba ile ba tla.
I hope so.	Ke tšepa seo.
In one day.	Ka letsatsi le le leng.
I know nothing about that.	Ha ke tsebe letho ka seo.
It is not difficult to start it.	Ha ho thata ho e qala.
And I'm very happy about it.	Hape ke thabile haholo ka eona.
Some are eating.	Ba bang baa ja.
He could not speak.	O ne a sitoa ho bua.
I would not wonder if anyone would like it or not.	Nke ke ka ipotsa hore na motho o tla rata kapa che.
I also cry a lot.	Hape ke lla haholo.
I never thought about that.	Ha kea ka ka nahana ka seo.
She is your wife.	Ke mosali oa hau.
He did not think of her.	O ne a sa nahane ka eena.
Get everything you can.	Fumana sohle seo u ka se khonang.
The error still has to be strong.	Phoso e ntse e lokela ho ba matla.
It really is.	Ho hlile ho joalo.
This has been a good idea.	Ena e bile mohopolo o motle.
It really is a thing.	Ehlile ke ntho.
I would love to hear from you.	Nka thabela ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
I love her.	Ke a mo rata.
He certainly did not expect that.	Ruri o ne a sa lebella seo.
That book is this book.	Buka eo ke buka ena.
They are trying to sleep.	Ba leka ho robala.
Go ahead, quickly.	Tsoela pele, kapele.
The phone is ringing, ringing, ringing.	Mohala oa lla, oa lla, oa lla.
They work hard.	Ba sebetsa ka thata.
Nice to see you enjoy it !.	Ke thabela ho o bona o e thabetse!.
They always play with my head.	Ba lula ba bapala ka hlooho ea ka.
I wish there was a way to do this.	Ke lakatsa eka ho ka ba le mokhoa oa ho etsa sena.
But there was nothing to that.	Empa ho ne ho se letho la seo.
It is something that will stay with us.	Ke ntho e tla dula le rona.
At this time.	Ka nako ena.
Then that fall will certainly happen next year.	Joale ka sebele ho oa hoo ho tla etsahala selemong se tlang.
I will take care of her.	Ke tla mo hlokomela.
You didn't have to go either.	Le uena u ne u sa lokela ho tsamaea.
It's a weird place.	Ke sebaka se makatsang.
You must arrive in the morning.	U tlameha ho fihla hoseng.
You look busy.	O shebahala o phathahane.
We were the same age, we were equal to children.	Re lekana ka lilemo, re ne re lekana le bana.
I do not believe it.	Ha ke e lumele.
And we did well.	Mme re entse hantle.
I can see that clearly.	Ke bona seo hantle.
It's bedtime.	Ke nako ea ho robala.
Always be careful.	Kamehla hlokomela.
He really keeps his place.	O hlile a boloka sebaka sa hae.
Thank you.	Kea leboha.
It is still dangerous.	E ntse e le kotsi.
We will need to hold a special ceremony.	Re tla hloka ho tšoara mokete o itseng.
He would not return.	O ne a ke ke a khutla.
I loved being with her.	Ke ne ke rata ho ba le eena.
He thought so.	O ile a nahana joalo.
He could see nothing.	O ne a sa bone letho.
With this book.	Ka buka ena.
You spend time trying to understand why.	U qeta nako u leka ho utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng.
Too many, maybe.	Tse ngata haholo, mohlomong.
I will not keep it long.	Nke ke ka o boloka nako e telele.
They came.	Ba ile ba tla.
We know this is not true.	Rea tseba hore sena hase ’nete.
I mean I'm a human being.	Ke bolela hore ke motho.
Hard place, that.	Sebaka se thata, seo.
Truly, it is a beautiful place.	Ka 'nete, ke sebaka se setle.
He knew who was speaking.	O ne a tseba ea buang.
The place got really bad.	Sebaka se ile sa ba mpe haholo.
Maybe this will help us better.	Mohlomong sena se tla re thusa hantle.
Which is what we do.	E leng seo re se etsang.
The previous work is still there.	Mosebetsi o fetileng o ntse o le teng.
People were really sure they had something.	Batho ba ne ba hlile ba na le bonnete ba hore ba na le ntho e itseng.
This is my team.	Sena ke sehlopha sa ka.
Great job for him.	Mosebetsi o moholo ho eena.
The children were happy.	Bana ba ne ba thabile.
He needed to find something.	O ne a hloka ho fumana ho hong.
We could know.	Re ne re ka tseba.
We did not want to do that.	Re ne re sa batle ho etsa joalo.
Thank you so much for coming in.	Ke leboha haholo ka ho kena.
It seemed like someone else.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka e tlameha ebe ke motho e mong.
I would love to sleep with you.	Ke rata ho robala le uena.
And they told us.	Mme ba re boleletse.
And they know it very well.	Mme ba e tseba hantle haholo.
They did not know what was happening anywhere.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe se etsahalang kae kapa kae.
That is exactly what happened here.	Ke sona hantle se etsahetseng mona.
It was very important.	E ne e le ea bohlokoa haholo.
You can stay.	U ka lula.
It was that or cry.	E ne e le seo kapa lla.
But he was already too late.	Empa o ne a se a le morao haholo.
It seemed very clear.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho hlakile haholo.
I will definitely be back for more of this.	Ka sebele ke tla khutla bakeng sa tse ling tse ngata tsa sena.
Some may have made a mistake.	E ka ’na eaba ba bang ba entse phoso.
These questions keep running.	Lipotso tsena li lula li tsoela pele.
I can no longer take it.	Ha ke sa khona ho nka hape.
This is not easy at all.	Sena ha se bonolo ho hang.
He took care of his mind.	O ile a hlokomela kelello ea hae.
You have never done this before.	Ha o so ka o etsa sena pele.
That's not fun at all.	Seo ha se monate ho hang.
He loved her.	O ile a mo rata.
My wife also uses it.	Mosali oa ka le eena oa e sebelisa.
It's happening.	E ntse e etsahala.
We don't want to go anywhere.	Ha re batle ho ea kae kapa kae.
Keep playing.	Tsoela pele ho bapala.
That was for other people.	Seo e ne e le sa batho ba bang.
I felt alive.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke phela.
And problems will certainly arise.	Mme ruri mathata a tla.
Not bad.	Ha e mpe.
However, they all felt the same way.	Leha ho le joalo, bohle ba ne ba ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
He did it.	O e entse.
They usually work.	Hangata ba sebetsa.
We need water to work.	Re hloka metsi ho sebetsa.
We need something new, new.	Re hloka ntho e ncha, e ncha.
They were still there.	Ba ne ba ntse ba le teng.
Perhaps life is very sad now.	Mohlomong bophelo bo bohloko haholo hona joale.
It has never been a problem,.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba bothata,.
Now he is afraid to do the work.	Hona joale o tšaba ho etsa mosebetsi.
So you can make such a call just once.	Kahoo o ka etsa mohala o joalo hang feela.
My mind was clear.	Kelello ea ka e ne e hlakile.
So sit down.	Kahoo lula fatše.
I do not want him.	Ha ke mo batle.
The more you give, the more you get.	Ha o fana haholo, o fumana ho feta.
Such a rule would not work.	Molao o joalo o ne o ke ke oa sebetsa.
Life was still good.	Bophelo bo ne bo ntse bo le monate.
He spends money to fix things.	O sebelisa chelete ho lokisa lintho.
It was not my fault.	E ne e se phoso ea ka.
I like to talk to her mom about it too.	Le 'na ke rata ho bolella 'mè oa hae ka taba eo.
None of his work was original.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea mosebetsi oa hae eo e neng e le ea pele.
He said it would not work.	O itse e ke ke ea sebetsa.
Be where you said you would be.	Eba moo o itseng o tla ba teng.
I do not know when or why.	Ha ke tsebe neng kapa joang kapa hobaneng.
You are better than I am today.	O molemo ho mpheta kajeno.
Sit down and think.	Dula mme o nahane.
No one else will know what you are saying.	Ha ho motho e mong ya tla tseba seo o se buang.
Her legs are working.	Maoto a hae a sebetsa.
I just finished it.	Ke qeta ho e qeta.
Everyone on anything.	Motho e mong le e mong ho eng kapa eng.
The first time he did that he made a terrible mistake.	Lekhetlo la pele ha a etsa joalo o ile a etsa phoso e mpe.
It is already doing so.	E se e ntse e etsa joalo.
Moreover, there was something about him.	Ho feta moo, ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ka eena.
In their own way.	Ka mokhoa oa bona.
Do it back first.	Etsa morao pele.
You just have to move on.	U tlameha feela ho tsoela pele.
Too easy for most people.	Ho ba bonolo haholo ho batho ba bangata.
All the best to you and your precious family.	Tsohle tse molemo ho uena le lelapa la hau la bohlokoa.
I used to feel that way every day.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ho ikutloa joalo letsatsi le leng le le leng.
May he never learn the truth.	E se eka le ka mohla a ke ke a ithuta ’nete .
Things had taken longer than he could have wished for.	Lintho li ne li nkile nako e telele ho feta kamoo a neng a ka rata kateng.
That will make your job a lot easier.	Seo se tla etsa hore mosebetsi oa hau o be bonolo haholo.
I really have.	Ke hlile ke na le.
Live a hard life.	Phela bophelo bo boima.
So much for thinking.	Haholo bakeng sa ho nahana.
But of course that will pass soon.	Empa ehlile hoo ho tla feta kapele.
So will you.	Le uena u tla ba joalo.
These old people could not read.	Batho bana ba khale ba ne ba sa tsebe ho bala.
He was arrested a few years ago.	O ile a tšoaroa lilemo tse 'maloa tse fetileng.
Nobody will know that.	Ha ho motho ya tla tseba seo.
For the first time starting this week.	Lekhetlo la pele ho qala bekeng ena.
And he was a good man to you.	Mme e ne e le monna ya molemo ho wena.
Clearly, he did not like the way he acted.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a sa rate tsela eo a entseng ka eona.
However, he knew it well.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a e tseba hantle.
However, the current situation was much more intense than he had anticipated.	Leha ho le joalo, boemo ba hona joale bo ne bo le matla ho feta kamoo a neng a lebeletse kateng.
I think hair also looks good.	Ke nahana hore moriri le ona o shebahala o le motle.
If you feel you want to do this in another easy way.	Haeba u ikutloa u batla ho etsa sena ka tsela e 'ngoe e bonolo.
I'm traveling a lot.	Ke ntse ke tsamaea haholo.
Her parents had really done it.	Batsoali ba hae ba ne ba hlile ba e entse.
There was a mistake, he could hear it.	Ho ne ho e-na le phoso, o ne a khona ho e utloa.
But it does happen.	Empa ho etsahala.
The closest time is this year.	Nako e haufi ke selemong sena.
Notice that.	Hlokomela seo.
I had no group.	Ke ne ke sena sehlopha.
He called the police.	O ile a letsetsa mapolesa.
Or provide anything for that matter.	Kapa ho fana ka eng kapa eng bakeng sa taba eo.
If you have something you want to say, tell me.	Haeba u na le seo u batlang ho se bua, mpolella sona.
I suspect a lot of people have it.	Ke belaela hore batho ba bangata ba na le eona.
Still, he seemed happy.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a bonahala a thabile.
This is not all.	Sena ha se sohle.
Really weird.	Ntho e makatsang ruri.
Maybe, maybe.	Mohlomong, mohlomong.
It was the day for it.	E ne e le letsatsi bakeng sa eona.
This is the same thing.	Ntho ena le eona e joalo.
We did not need that.	Re ne re sa hloke seo.
It only drinks coffee.	E noa kofi feela.
It is not a new phenomenon.	Ha se taba e ncha.
But keep your issues.	Empa boloka litaba tsa hau.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
For the time being.	Bakeng sa nako.
I decided to read another book.	Ke entse qeto ea ho bala buka e ’ngoe.
In fact, he should not.	Ha e le hantle, ha aa lokela.
I have never seen anything like it.	Ha ke e-s'o bone ntho e tšoanang le eona.
It would have to be tonight.	E ne e tla lokela ho ba bosiung bona.
I knew him.	Ke ne ke mo tseba.
And here's another idea.	Mme mona ke mohopolo o mong.
We all have to suffer.	Kaofela ha rōna re lokela ho utloa bohloko.
This book has all three.	Buka ena e na le tse tharo kaofela.
That he was very bad.	Hore o ne a le mpe haholo.
It could have gone to him.	E ka be e ile ea ea ho eena.
The man was strong.	Monna eo o ne a le matla.
The process of doing this is clear.	Mokhoa oa ho etsa sena o hlakile.
Learning.	Ho ithuta.
I didn’t think so much.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hakaalo.
That is not enough.	Seo ha sea lekana.
You do not even have to think about it.	Ha ho hlokahale le hore u nahane ka eona.
No one has ever heard of them.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a utloa ka tsona.
She's happy, man.	O thabile, monna.
He spent a lot of time buying clothes and shoes.	O ne a qeta nako e ngata a reka liaparo le lieta.
I wanted him to do anything.	Ke ne ke batla hore a etse eng kapa eng.
I have school and stuff.	Ke na le sekolo le lintho.
I have encountered only one issue.	Ke kopane le taba e le 'ngoe feela.
We could all do that.	Kaofela re ne re ka etsa joalo.
The woman wanted to see.	Mosali o ne a batla ho bona.
Yes, that's right.	E, ke 'nete.
I should not have said it.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho e bua.
But you do not have to decide this question.	Empa ha ho hlokahale ho etsa qeto ea potso ena.
For me, who would stay home to watch my family.	Ho 'na, ke mang ea neng a ka lula hae ho sheba lelapa la ka.
And sometimes you do.	'Me ka linako tse ling u etsa joalo.
That was difficult, but it worked.	Seo se ne se le thata, empa se ile sa sebetsa.
That is what he needed.	Ke sona seo a neng a se hloka.
They come from everywhere.	Ba tsoa sebakeng se seng le se seng.
It was not dangerous.	E ne e se kotsi.
This is my style.	Ena ke mokhoa oa ka.
The time is very painful.	Nako e bohloko haholo.
They were leaving.	Ba ne ba tsamaea.
This would be breakfast.	Sena e ne e tla ba lijo tsa hoseng.
I've never seen that.	Ha ke eso bone seo.
Eventually we never saw it again.	Qetellong ha rea ​​ka ra hlola re e bona.
Her phone rang.	Mohala oa hae oa lla.
However, this was not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena e ne e se sa bohlokoa.
I enjoy them all at times.	Ke li thabela kaofela ka linako tse ling.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
I think we play well on it.	Ke nahana hore re bapala hantle ho eona.
There was nothing else he could do.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng leo le ka le etsang.
He meets her at his home every evening.	O kopana le eena ha hae mantsiboea a mang le a mang.
Her parents did not understand the issue.	Batsoali ba hae ba ne ba sa utloisise hore na taba ke efe.
It doesn't matter to me.	Ha se taba le nna.
The police were powerless.	Mapolesa a ne a se na matla.
I did not know where they went, but they did return.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ba ile kae, empa ba ile ba khutla.
It will take years to do so.	Ho tla nka lilemo ho etsa joalo.
It is very difficult to be strong right now.	Ho thata haholo ho ba matla hona joale.
I don’t think it was necessary for any of them.	Ha ke nahane hore ho ne ho sa hlokahale le e mong oa bona.
They give us time to do even more important things.	Li re fa nako ea ho etsa lintho tsa bohlokoa haholoanyane.
That should be easy to do.	Seo se lokela ho ba bonolo ho se etsa.
It left, but found only an empty space.	E ile ea tsamaea, empa ea fumana feela sebaka se se nang letho.
We had their shoes on.	Re ne re e-na le lieta tsa bona.
.	.
Surprisingly, it is safe.	Ho makatsang ke hore ha ho kotsi.
He didn't even look at her.	Ha a ka a mo sheba le ho mo sheba.
Another player took his time.	Sebapali se seng se ile sa nka nako ea sona.
Indeed, it is we who will suffer.	Ka sebele, ke rōna ba tla utloa bohloko.
He doesn't get it.	Ha a e fumane.
I went to watch him.	Ke ile ka ea mo shebella.
You can have him now if you want him.	U ka ba le eena hona joale haeba u mo batla.
That will be the last.	Seo e tla ba sa ho qetela.
Find out who she is.	Fumana hore na ke mang.
They often need to work late hours.	Hangata ba hloka ho sebetsa lihora tsa morao.
He is not real, he is not.	Ha se oa sebele, ha a eo.
Everyone knew them there and loved them.	E mong le e mong o ne a li tseba moo ’me a li rata.
I never got it.	Ha ke eso e fumane.
But still, you have to live.	Empa leha ho le joalo, u tlameha ho phela.
Which is a very simple thing.	E leng ntho e bonolo haholo.
But the dog is yours.	Empa ntja ke ea hao.
This is important.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa.
I could see it now.	Ke ne ke khona ho e bona joale.
So do this then.	Kahoo etsa sena ka nako eo.
In fact, she realized, she already had a mother.	Ha e le hantle, o ile a hlokomela, o ne a se a ntse a e-na le 'mè.
We no longer think about it.	Ha re sa hlola re nahana ka eona.
He is the greatest man in the trade.	Ke monna e moholo ka ho fetisisa mosebetsing oa matsoho.
I'm too late.	Ke morao haholo.
They never spoke.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba bua.
This type of thing cannot continue.     	Ntho ea mofuta ona e ke ke ea tsoela pele.     
ho.	ho.
Everyone has seen it.	Bohle ba e bone.
It is still good to have them.	Ho ntse ho le molemo ho ba le tsona.
People just stare.	Batho ba sheba feela.
This has never been a problem for us.	Hona ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba bothata ho rōna.
He had just left for a long time.	O ne a sa tsoa tsamaea nako e telele.
Our team is playing well.	Sehlopha sa rona se bapala hantle.
He said it was good news.	O itse ke litaba tse monate.
It is usually very busy.	Hangata ho phathahane haholo.
I am useless to be alone.	Ha ke na thuso ho ba mong.
Maybe for a long time, he was the only one who didn't want me to see.	Mohlomong nako e telele, ke eena feela ea neng a sa batle hore ke bone.
Maybe that will make it even better.	Mohlomong seo se tla etsa hore e be molemo haholoanyane.
I know how you must feel, but this is police work.	Kea tseba hore na u tlameha ho ikutloa joang, empa ona ke mosebetsi oa mapolesa.
We just stop.	Re ema feela.
But he still goes back.	Empa leha ho le joalo o khutlela morao.
How.	Hore na.
I could not say the real thing.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ho bua ntho ea sebele.
You know some of them.	U tseba tse ling tsa tsona.
He comes to me.	O tla ho nna.
I would say that was the best.	Nka re hoo ho ne ho le molemo ka ho fetisisa.
You will get out of this.	O tla tsoa ho sena.
Bad good good.	E mpe e ntle.
Of course, maybe both.	Ha e le hantle, mohlomong ka bobeli.
These foods were supposed to make you bigger and stronger.	Lijo tsena li ne li lokela ho etsa hore u be moholo 'me u be matla.
But it was not what he expected.	Empa o ne a se seo a neng a se lebeletse.
That just happens.	Seo se etsahala feela.
It seems like talking to a real person.	Ho bonahala eka ho bua motho oa sebele le e mong.
And we'll pass through you, too.	Mme re tla feta ha hao, le rona.
It is important to read.	Ho bohlokoa ho bala.
That works sometimes.	Seo se sebetsa ka linako tse ling.
I do not want to know you.	Ha ke batle ho o tseba.
Besides, she is safe.	Ntle ho moo, ha a na kotsi.
We will probably spend more time together.	Mohlomong re tla qeta nako e ngata re le hammoho.
His life is in danger.	Bophelo ba hae bo kotsing.
I hope you find this soon.	Ke tšepa hore u tla fumana sena haufinyane.
And you're going out to visit.	'Me u ntse u tsoela ka ntle ho etela.
They found nothing.	Ha baa ka ba fumana letho.
My father had to work.	Ntate o ile a tlameha ho sebetsa.
I can’t look like myself and be someone else.	Ha ke khone ho shebahala joaloka 'na' me ke be motho e mong.
I looked at my father.	Ka sheba ntate.
It was almost as bad as he expected, which was a very bad thing.	E ne e batla e le mpe kamoo a neng a lebeletse kateng, e leng ntho e mpe haholo.
So we can move on now.	Kahoo re ka tsoela pele hona joale.
Try it a little bit.	Ho e leka hanyane.
You will have to see.	O tla lokela ho bona.
However, it does not matter.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho na taba.
This is not the case for the second time.	Sena ha se joalo bakeng sa nako ea bobeli.
There is no more or less.	Ha ho na ho feta kapa ho feta.
You have never seen anything like it.	Ha o eso bone ntho e jwalo.
Just an empty space.	Sebaka se se nang letho feela.
There was a lot going on, the whole situation.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tse ileng tsa tsoela pele, boemo bohle.
And that wasn't the worst thing.	Mme hoo e ne e se ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
I did not know what to do next.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke etse eng hape.
A long time ago.	Khale khale.
He must have known.	E tlameha ebe o ne a tseba.
So he wants it.	Kahoo oa e batla.
I really enjoyed it.	Ke ile ka e thabela haholo.
I've never seen him talk so much, really.	Ha ke eso bone ha a bua hakaalo, ha e le hantle.
We talk about this a lot in the group.	Re bua ka taba ena haholo sehlopheng.
I hope your day goes well.	Kea tšepa hore letsatsi la hau le tsamaea hantle.
You can enjoy playing with toys.	U ka thabela ho bapala ka lintho tsa ho bapala.
He had no reason to do so.	O ne a se na lebaka la ho etsa joalo.
Did these people really exist?	Na batho baa ba ne ba hlile ba le teng?
The man had to call his son.	Monna o ile a tlameha ho letsetsa mora oa hae.
The importance of sleep.	Bohlokoa ba ho robala.
That is where we will be.	E leng moo re tla ba teng.
They like what they do.	Ba rata seo ba se etsang.
And people need to get together.	Mme batho ba lokela ho kopana.
He was in school.	O ne a le sekolong.
You expect it to fall in the near future.	U lebeletse hore e tla oa nakong e tlang e haufi.
I will not be a problem.	Nke ke ka ba bothata.
Legal work is one of these.	Mosebetsi oa molao ke o mong oa tsena.
I'm glad you enjoyed your stay with us.	Ke thabetse hore ebe u thabetse ho lula ha hao le rona.
It comes from a doctor.	E tsoa ho ngaka.
That way he would not have to feel close to it.	Ka tsela eo o ne a ke ke a tlameha ho ikutloa a le haufi le eona.
He must have been absent.	E tlameha ebe o ne a le sieo.
He decided to go ahead.	A etsa qeto ea ho ea pele.
The same is true of my head.	Ho joalo le ka hlooho ea ka.
Now, something more powerful.	Jwale, ho hong ho matla ho feta.
It was not a good car, by any means.	E ne e se koloi e ntle, ka mokhoa ofe kapa ofe.
It must be now.	E tlameha ebe joale.
I really got it.	Ke hlile ke e fumane.
As if nothing had happened.	Eka ha ho letho le kileng la etsahala.
He walks away deciding what to do.	O tsamaea a ntse a etsa qeto ea hore na a etse eng.
And often it is.	'Me hangata ho joalo.
Her hands began to ache.	Matsoho a hae a qala ho utloa bohloko.
When she looked at the man, she knew what it meant.	Ha a sheba monna, a tseba hore na e bolela eng.
That same year for sure.	Selemong sona seo ka 'nete.
I would be very grateful.	Nka leboha haholo.
I think everyone should too !.	Ke nahana hore motho e mong le e mong le eena o lokela!.
Then you have something out of or for.	Joale u na le ho hong ho tsoa ho kapa bakeng sa.
No need to call first.	Ha ho hlokahale ho letsetsa pele.
The woman was him.	Mosali e ne e le eena.
I do not think it can happen today.	Ha ke nahane hore ho ka etsahala kajeno.
Everyone loves a good party.	Motho e mong le e mong o rata mokete o motle.
But, it was for the best.	Empa, e ne e le bakeng sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He's a wonderful man.	O monna ya makatsang.
Walking in a group can be very fun.	Ho tsamaea ka sehlopha ho ka ba monate haholo.
Express your opinion.	Bua maikutlo a hau.
I hope you are suffering in some way.	Ke tšepa hore u utloa bohloko ka tsela e itseng.
A book like this may be what they need.	Buka e kang ena e ka ’na ea e-ba seo ba se hlokang.
I don’t think that’s a way to do that.	Ha ke nahane hore ke mokhoa oa ho etsa joalo.
Three days from there.	Matsatsi a mararo ho tloha moo.
I hear what you are saying.	Ke utloa seo u se buang.
The important thing is that they had friends.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore ba ne ba e-na le metsoalle.
I was unable to walk due to time constraints.	Ha kea ka ka khona ho tsamaea ka lebaka la nako.
So he sat down, waiting for you, too.	Kahoo a lula, a u emetse, le rona.
It takes on the empty.	E nka ho ba se nang letho.
There was nothing else he could do from here.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng leo a ka le etsang ho tloha mona.
But then he decided to tell the truth only.	Empa joale o ile a etsa qeto ea ho bua ’nete feela.
You may have heard about him.	Mohlomong u utloile ka eena.
We just want to make sure you are not mistaken.	Re mpa re batla ho etsa bonnete ba hore ha o etse phoso.
They eat food.	Ba ja lijo.
That's a good idea.	Ke mohopolo o motle.
It wasn't too hard.	Ho ne ho se thata haholo.
They do not seem to be sleeping at all.	Ho bonahala ba sa robala ho hang.
We have a lot of kids like him here.	Re na le bana ba bangata ba kang eena mona.
He could not walk for long.	O ne a sa khone ho tsamaea nako e telele.
I understand that sometimes you need to go.	Kea utloisisa hore ka linako tse ling u hloka ho tsamaea.
I know how dangerous it was for you.	Kea tseba hore na ho ne ho le kotsi hakae ho uena.
We did not expect anything.	Ha rea ​​lebella letho.
It's really simple.	E bonolo ruri.
But you have never really met.	Empa ha e le hantle ha o eso kopane.
And they play hard.	Mme ba bapala ka thata.
That's really nice.	Seo se setle ruri.
He did not have a driver's license.	O ne a se na lengolo la ho khanna.
He was very professional and heard our situation.	E ne e le setsebi haholo 'me a utloa boemo ba rona.
I see that in many today.	Ke bona seo ka ba bangata kajeno.
It is difficult to say what you are talking about.	Ho thata ho bolela seo o buang ka sona.
The doctor agreed.	Ngaka e ile ea lumela.
It needs work.	E hloka mosebetsi.
Nobody wants this.	Ha ho motho ea batlang sena.
It is my value.	Ke bohlokoa ba ka.
I think that means something.	Ke nahana hore ho bolela ho hong.
We should not have done that.	Re ne re sa lokela ho etsa joalo.
I knew he would do that.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o tla etsa joalo.
That started things.	Seo se ile sa qala lintho.
I work in the same area.	Ke sebetsa sebakeng se le seng.
We have nothing else to think about.	Ha re na letho le leng leo re ka nahanang ka lona.
But that is the point.	Empa ke eona taba feela.
The man's feelings were hurt.	Maikutlo a monna a ne a utloile bohloko.
And I take that.	Mme nka seo.
They had no time for us.	Ba ne ba se na nako ea rōna.
It certainly meant that he could.	Ka sebele ho ne ho bolela hore o ne a ka khona.
And you want them to be the best they can be.	'Me u batla hore ba be molemo ka ho fetisisa kamoo ba ka khonang.
I see the problem.	Ke bona bothata.
He was probably a man.	Mohlomong e ne e le monna.
The doctor watched her as she walked.	Ngaka e ile ea mo sheba ha a tsamaea.
You just don't know.	Ha o tsebe feela.
I can't think of many more.	Ha ke khone ho nahana ka tse ling tse ngata.
You will have to ask.	O tla lokela ho botsa.
I keep wondering if it really matters.	Ke tsoela pele ho ipotsa hore na e hlile e bohlokoa.
I feel like we can now start moving forward.	Ke utloa eka joale re ka qala ho ea pele.
We all know that nothing will ever happen.	Kaofela rea ​​tseba hore ho hang ha ho letho le tla etsahala.
It is still possible.	E ntse e ka etsahala.
Make sure it is.	Etsa bonnete ba hore ho joalo.
It's just here.	Ho na le mona feela.
Or from here.	Kapa ho tloha mona.
Some like it.	Ba bang ba e rata.
A better man could have sought that truth.	Monna ea betere a ka be a ile a batla ’nete eo.
Many people saw us.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba re bona.
I had to tell them about it.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho ba bolella ka eona.
It looked good.	E ile ea bonahala e le ntle.
I thought it was clear.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho hlakile.
It will never go back.	Ha e sa tla khutlela morao.
That is what we were expecting.	Ke seo re neng re se lebeletse.
He has no place at all in this group.	Ha a na sebaka ho hang sehlopheng sena.
I still believe in him, as a group.	Ke ntse ke lumela ho eena, joalo ka sehlopha.
He would never do such a thing.	O ne a ke ke a etsa ntho e kang eo.
It seems like a very important time to find it.	E shebahala e le ea bohlokoa nako ea ho e fumana.
Some of them are ongoing.	Tse ling tsa tsona li ntse li tsoela pele.
Find out.	Fumana.
From this point on, there would be no going back.	Ho tloha nakong ena ho ea pele, ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba le ho khutlela morao.
And that means something.	Mme hoo ho bolela ho hong.
He just a.	O mpa feela a.
It was no longer painful, it was no longer sad.	Ho ne ho se ho se bohloko, ho se ho se masoabi.
How much money did you spend?	U ne u sebelisa chelete e kae?
From the moment we learn to read, we are able.	Ho tloha ha re ithuta ho bala, rea khona.
It is only necessary.	Ho hlokahala feela.
Ask questions.	Botsa lipotso.
The most important thing is to get started!	Ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa ke ho qala!.
I caught him there.	Ke ile ka mo tšoara moo.
That started.	Seo se ile sa qala.
Another important thing is to look at the memory space.	Ntho e 'ngoe ea bohlokoa ke ho sheba sebaka sa mohopolo.
Thank you, everyone.	Kea leboha, bohle.
They decided that they wanted to be friends.	Ba ile ba etsa qeto ea hore ba batla ho ba metsoalle.
So let's see if that works.	Kahoo a re bone hore na seo sea sebetsa.
I know you were trying to help.	Kea tseba hore u ne u leka ho thusa.
We think there is.	Re nahana hore ho na le.
They talk hard.	Ba bua ka thata.
But talk to them.	Empa bua le bona.
Or do any work.	Kapa etsa mosebetsi ofe kapa ofe.
It's nice to be with him.	Ho ba le eena ho monate.
I can't play with the others.	Ha ke khone ho bapala le tse ling.
There were too many people.	Ho ne ho e-na le batho ba bangata haholo.
A strange car stops next to him.	Koloi e makatsang e ema haufi le eena.
They loved you so much.	Ba ne ba o rata haholo.
Have one father.	Le be le ntate a le mong.
They had a way.	Ba ne ba e-na le tsela.
This is not just a phone call.	Sena ha se mohala feela.
Obviously, he did not understand that question.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a sa utloisise potso eo.
But I started to think.	Empa ke ile ka qala ho nahana.
It’s just that it was fun.	Ke taba ea hore ho ne ho le monate.
I hope it will help.	Ke tšepa hore e tla thusa.
To many, he seemed insignificant.	Ho ba bangata, o ne a bonahala a se na thuso.
She knows her husband.	O tseba monna wa hae.
They looked suspicious.	Ba ne ba shebahala ba belaela.
I have no time to care for others.	Ha ke na nako ea ho hlokomela ba bang.
This should be easy, but my head is swimming.	Sena se lokela ho ba bonolo, empa hlooho ea ka e sesa.
It is unlikely that they will.	Ho ke ke ha etsahala hore ebe ba ka etsa joalo.
I was glad she didn't find him.	Ke ile ka thabela hore ebe ha aa ka a mo fumana.
That's not what it's about.	Ha se seo e buang ka sona.
At his feet.	Ka maoto a hae.
I hope you have no problem standing up.	Ke tšepa hore ha u na bothata ba ho ema.
The young man died in the accident.	Mohlankana eo o ile a hlokahala kotsing eo.
Like all the others.	Joalo ka ba bang kaofela.
She asked her husband to stay.	O ile a kōpa monna oa hae hore a lule.
Until now, they had never done that.	Ho fihlela joale, ba ne ba e-s'o ka ba etsa joalo.
Thank you so much for giving.	Ke leboha haholo ka ho fana.
But very well.	Empa hantle haholo.
We were healthy.	Re ne re phela hantle.
You and your children.	Wena le bana ba hao.
It could not have happened.	E ne e ke ke ea etsahala.
Lots, lots to come.	Tse ngata, tse ngata tse tlang.
Even maybe not.	Leha mohlomong ha ho joalo.
They were very close, yet so far.	Ba ne ba le haufi haholo, leha ho le joalo ho fihlela joale.
But that was not the case.	Empa ho ne ho se joalo.
No one could speak.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka bua.
We want to help her.	Re batla ho mo thusa.
There is only one way to know.	Ho na le mokhoa o le mong feela oa ho tseba.
It was delicious.	E ne e le monate haholo.
He slept very early in the morning.	O ile a robala hoseng haholo.
But he could not do it in his own time.	Empa ha ea ka ea khona ho e etsa ka nako ea eona.
I did not know how or when we would return.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na re tla khutla joang kapa neng.
His job provided everything he needed.	Mosebetsi oa hae o ne o fana ka sohle seo a se hlokang.
This means that it can fit almost anywhere.	Sena se bolela hore e ka lekana hoo e ka bang kae kapa kae.
You have to do the work.	U tlameha ho etsa mosebetsi.
I hope it is clear.	Ke tšepa hore e hlakile.
That morning.	Hoseng hoo.
It is better to have them.	Ho molemo ho ba le tsona.
Now I have another.	Hona joale ke na le e 'ngoe.
He will not leave you.	A ke ke a le tlohela.
It's a wonderful day today, isn't it?	Ke letsatsi le monate kajeno, na ha ho joalo?
So, it is.	Kahoo, ho joalo.
Do well though.	Etsa hantle leha ho le joalo.
This was not what they expected.	Sena ba ne ba sa se lebella.
This should go without saying, but that is where it comes from.	Sena se lokela ho tsamaea ntle le ho bua, empa ke moo se leng teng.
It was easy to find a place.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho fumana sebaka.
It seemed.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka.
We have power.	Re na le matla.
Who he was, it did not matter.	Hore na e ne e le mang, ho ne ho se taba.
You will need it.	U tla e hloka.
He was alone in the room.	O ne a le mong ka phaposing.
He realized what he had done.	O ile a hlokomela seo a se entseng.
And they helped.	Mme ba ile ba thusa.
They will think you are giving them money to play.	Ba tla nahana hore u ba fa chelete ea ho bapala.
We really enjoyed being with her.	Re ne re thabela ho ba le eena haholo.
Then you have to make a decision.	Ka nako eo o tlameha ho etsa qeto.
She is very happy there.	O thabile haholo moo.
He makes everyone their life.	O etsa hore motho e mong le e mong e be bophelo ba bona.
He will never drive anything again.	Ha a sa tla hlola a khanna letho.
That is, they were already there.	Ke hore ba ne ba se ba le teng.
I hear them well.	Ke ba utloa hantle.
I wouldn’t do this today, of course.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa sena kajeno, ehlile.
They traveled for a long time before they arrived.	Ba ile ba tsamaea nako e telele pele ba fihla.
It was a difficult day for him.	E ne e le letsatsi le boima ho eena.
It wasn't really as bad as it looked.	E ne e hlile e se mpe kamoo e neng e shebahala kateng.
You do not want to get hurt.	Ha u batle ho tsoa kotsi.
In the end, it was a good one he could work with.	Qetellong, e ntle eo a neng a ka sebetsa le eona.
They can't afford them.	Ha ba khone ho fana ka tsona.
I don’t think one is easier than the other.	Ha ke nahane hore e 'ngoe e bonolo ho feta e 'ngoe.
I just slept in you.	Ke sa tsoa robala ka ho uena.
They leave as soon as they finish eating.	Ba tloha hang ha ba qeta ho ja.
We could have done the same, if it had not been for him.	Le rona re ka be re entse jwalo, hoja ho ne ho se jwalo.
He would not ask.	O ne a ke ke a botsa.
Some parents are tired, some are not.	Batsoali ba bang ba khathetse, ba bang ha ba joalo.
He would work harder, and he would think.	O ne a tla sebetsa ho feta, mme o ne a tla nahana.
He would never pay her back.	O ne a ke ke a hlola a mo lefa.
It is best not to buy old clothes.	Ho molemo hore u se ke ua reka liaparo tsa khale.
He will be here a long time.	O tla ba mona nako e telele.
It may take some time.	E ka nka nako e itseng.
Nothing else happens.	Haho se seng se etsahalang.
But that was clearly not the case.	Empa ho hlakile hore ho ne ho se joalo.
And, they can be there again this year.	'Me, ba ka ba teng hape selemong sena.
This takes time.	Sena se nka nako.
We were looking for someone who could write.	Re ne re batla motho ea khonang ho ngola.
However, it is not very important.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e bohlokoa haholo.
Although they were still new, they were really good.	Le hoja li ne li ntse li le ncha, li ne li hlile li le molemo.
Without water there is no life	Ntle le metsi ha ho na bophelo
It will not give at all.	Ha e na ho fana ho hang.
It's still a good rule of thumb.	E ntse e le molao o motle.
It was very painful.	Ho ne ho le bohloko haholo.
And we can be sure that it will be so.	Mme re na le bonnete ba hore ho tla ba jwalo.
I know, this is not fun to say.	Kea tseba, sena ha se monate ho bua.
He was good for such things.	O ne a le molemo bakeng sa lintho tse joalo.
I'll watch it tonight.	Ke tla e shebella bosiung bona.
Eena.	Eena.
He has been the most important player on the team this year.	E bile sebapali sa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa sehlopheng selemong sena.
It was really time to drink.	E ne e hlile e le nako ea ho noa.
I'm so tired.	Ke khathetse hore.
Many of them.	Tse ngata tsa tsona.
And now some people take just a little bit a day.	Mme jwale batho ba bang ba nka hanyane feela ka letsatsi.
It's a long time.	Ke nako e telele.
If not, that's really a problem.	Ha ho se jwalo, ke bothata ruri.
However, there is no food.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho na lijo.
She is our mother.	Ke mme wa rona.
Most of these, you probably use them all the time.	Tse ngata tsa tsena, mohlomong u li sebelisa ka linako tsohle.
But that was just three days ago.	Empa e ne e le matsatsi a mararo feela a fetileng.
I hope to meet you there.	Ke tšepa ho kopana le uena moo.
Of course, we too could learn nothing from it.	Ke ’nete hore le rōna re ne re ke ke ra ithuta letho ho eona.
Very good posture.	Ho ema hantle haholo.
And in a few days.	Le ka matsatsi a 'maloa.
Something very wrong is happening to him.	Ho na le ntho e seng ntle haholo e etsahalang ho eena.
I am a morning man.	Ke motho oa hoseng.
They understand.	Ba utloisisa.
The car is moving smoothly.	Koloi e tsamaea hantle.
His team, he said, has everything.	Sehlopha sa hae, o itse, se na le ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
She is very happy.	O thabile haholo.
That is, to this day.	Ke hore, ho fihlela kajeno.
I have been wanting to write this book for many years.	Ke na le lilemo tse ngata ke batla ho ngola buka ena.
I wish that.	Ke lakatsa seo.
They had little contact with other children.	Ba ne ba sa kopane hakaalo le bana ba bang.
He loves you more than his life.	O u rata ho feta bophelo ba hae.
I understand the point though, I think.	Ke utloisisa taba leha ho le joalo, ke nahana.
I did not know about them.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ka tsona.
You will probably have heard of him.	Mohlomong u tla be u utloile ka eena.
I really enjoyed it.	Ke ile ka e thabela haholo.
But he had nothing.	Empa o ne a se na letho.
Giving them is a good thing.	Ho fana ka tsona ke ntho e ntle.
Lots of kids here.	Bana ba bangata mona.
He arrived early.	O ile a fihla pele ho nako.
I see we will have to watch you.	Kea bona hore re tla tlameha ho u shebella.
However, that is certainly not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e le hantle seo hase 'nete.
I feel a little better.	Ke ikutloa ke le betere.
That is why it exists.	Ke ka hona e leng teng.
And he says how it is.	'Me o bolela kamoo e leng kateng.
I should not have done this.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho etsa sena.
It may take decades or more.	E ka nka lilemo tse mashome kapa ho feta.
You could say that they were.	U ka re ba ne ba le joalo.
We have to try another method.	Re tlameha ho leka mokhoa o mong.
Eventually it would start.	Qetellong e ne e tla qala.
It's a good thing you do something like that.	Ke ntho e ntle ha o etsa ntho e kang eo.
It can't help you.	Ha e khone ho u thusa.
He is her husband.	O monna wa hae.
We were probably closer than we knew.	E ka ’na eaba re ne re le haufi ho feta kamoo re neng re tseba kateng.
But they work very well.	Empa ba sebetsa hantle haholo.
Of course, I did not.	Ha e le hantle, ha kea ka ka etsa joalo.
But yes, it can happen.	Empa e, ho ka etsahala.
That is the way life is.	Ke kamoo bophelo bo leng kateng.
Therefore,.	Ka hona, .
But you haven't been here all that time.	Empa ha o eso be mona ka nako eo kaofela.
If they tell you about it, it 's a lot of fun.	Haeba ba u bolella eona hape, e monate haholo.
It's something else.	Ke ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I see a way out now.	Ke bona tsela ea ho tsoa hona joale.
However, I could not.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke sa khone.
It should not be so hard.	Ha ea lokela ho ba thata hakaalo.
Think of something else.	Nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
There is nothing about being human.	Ha ho letho ka ho ba motho.
He said he was not alone.	O ile a re o ne a se mong.
But there is plenty of food.	Empa ho na le lijo tse ngata.
Think of it as the first night.	E nahane e le bosiu ba pele.
He did such a wonderful job.	O entse mosebetsi o motle hakana.
Everything we wanted to know and we had no way of knowing.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo re neng re batla ho e tseba 'me re ne re se na mokhoa oa ho tseba.
To do something.	Ho etsa ho hong.
One has to read.	E mong o lokela ho bala.
If you plan to tell a teacher, go do it.	Haeba u rera ho bolella tichere, tsamaea u e etse.
I'm going to bed now.	Ke ea robala hona joale.
There are a lot of clothes, but she doesn't want anything.	Ho na le liaparo tse ngata, empa ha ho letho leo a le batlang.
My mother used to go with him.	’Mè o ne a tloaetse ho tsamaea le eena.
Yes, there is a problem.	E, ho na le bothata.
He will give you exactly enough.	O tla u fa tsona hantle ho lekana.
He could not tell anyone why.	O ne a ke ke a bolella mang kapa mang lebaka.
Write those things down.	Ngola lintho tseo fatše.
Here are some of my ones.	Tse ling tsa ka ke tsena.
I work hard.	Ke sebetsa ka thata.
Or maybe it's not for you.	Kapa mohlomong ha se bakeng sa hau.
We felt like we could play in it.	Re ne re utloa eka re ka bapala ho eona.
I'm guilty.	Ke molato.
Find someone who will take care of you.	Fumana motho ea tla u hlokomela.
No, he will not.	Che, a ke ke a etsa joalo.
Another time you met me.	Nako e 'ngoe hape u kile ua kopana le 'na.
Doing the right thing can help.	Ho etsa ntho e ntle ho ka thusa.
We look at it a second time.	Re sheba lekhetlo la bobeli.
Thank you very much for your article.	Ke leboha haholo ka taba ea hau.
I do not know how long he will be away this time.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o tla ba sieo nako e kae nakong ena.
I think it was just me.	Ke nahana hore e ne e le nna feela.
They were already dressed like policemen.	Ba ne ba se ba apere joaloka mapolesa.
They were not difficult after all.	Ba ne ba se thata ka mor'a tsohle.
He knew what he wanted to say.	O ne a tseba seo a batlang ho se bua.
There is no way that can ever happen.	Haho kamoo seo se ka etsahalang le ka mohla.
So there was one before that.	Kahoo ho ne ho e-na le e 'ngoe pele ho moo.
And one has to pay.	Mme motho o tlameha ho lefa.
If it were me, school would come first.	Haeba e ne e le ’na, sekolo se ne se tla tla pele.
It wasn't too late to be friends again.	E ne e e-s'o be morao haholo hore e be metsoalle hape.
I think this is kind of it.	Ke nahana hore ena ke mofuta oa eona.
And be beautiful.	'Me ke be motle.
This year, it’s the same feeling.	Selemong sena, ke maikutlo a tšoanang.
I got right in.	Ke ile ka kena hantle.
And that's three days ago.	Mme hoo ke matsatsi a mararo a fetileng.
It was somehow true.	E ne e le 'nete ka tsela e itseng.
Make them better.	Etsa hore ba be betere.
He wrote carefully.	O ne a ngola ka hloko.
Then he.	Joale eena.
This was good for them.	Sena se ne se le molemo ho bona.
It was something else he still had not thought about.	E ne e le ntho e 'ngoe hape eo a neng a ntse a sa nahane ka eona.
Behold, here is my son.	Bona, mora wa ka ke eo.
I didn’t have to look.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho sheba.
You will find a way.	O tla fumana tsela.
Because that's what it meant to me.	Hobane ke seo e neng e se bolela ho nna.
Anything else, and you lie on the floor.	Ntho efe kapa efe e 'ngoe, 'me u robala fatše.
It just isn't.	Ho mpa ho se joalo.
But was it that easy?	Empa na ho ne ho le bonolo joalo.
But this is not the case.	Empa sena ha se joalo.
I certainly would not want to be that guy.	Ka sebele nke ke ka batla ho ba mohlankana eo.
But you usually have to go.	Empa hangata u tlameha ho tsamaea.
Sweet, sweet things.	Lintho tse monate, tse monate.
Only we.	Ke rona feela.
We are not important enough.	Ha re bohlokoa ho lekana.
It was the same with everyone else.	Ho bile joalo ka ba bang kaofela.
No dinner with any of us.	Ha ho lijo tsa mantsiboea le mang kapa mang oa rona.
It was not difficult for him.	Ho ne ho se thata ho eena.
And it is very dangerous to ask anyone.	'Me ho kotsi haholo ho botsa mang kapa mang.
That's over.	Seo se feta.
Buy as you used to and make money again.	Reka kamoo u neng u tloaetse ho etsa 'me u fumane chelete hape.
I started to think about life.	Ke ile ka qala ho nahana ka bophelo.
Otherwise, do what you did to get here.	Ho seng joalo, etsa seo u se entseng ho tla mona.
Did he even know about.	Na o bile a tseba ka.
She is very sweet.	O monate haholo.
They give him whatever they need.	Ba mo fa eng kapa eng eo ba e hlokang.
He had made a good time.	O ne a entse nako e monate.
So we are very happy with it.	Kahoo re thabile haholo ka eona.
Can you hear it ?.	Na u ka e utloa?.
It's very simple, really.	Ho bonolo haholo, ka 'nete.
Tell them why.	Ba bolelle lebaka.
At any time we would have done so.	Ka nako efe kapa efe re ka be re entse joalo.
Everyone loved their food because it tasted so good.	E mong le e mong o ne a rata lijo tsa hae hobane li monate haholo.
But no one tried to do it.	Empa ha ho motho ea ileng a leka ho e etsa.
She wants to spend time with her children.	O batla ho qeta nako e itseng le bana ba hae.
I can go on.	Nka tsoela pele.
That is clear.	Seo se hlakile.
We usually drink water.	Hangata re noa metsi.
I work from home.	Ke sebetsa hae.
Dinner is good.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea li ntle.
He loved her now.	O ne a mo rata jwale.
It will always be easy, or maybe easy.	E tla lula e le bonolo, kapa mohlomong e le bonolo.
Some take longer, while others take longer.	Tse ling li nka nako e telele, ha tse ling li nka nako e telele.
I will never be innocent.	Nke ke ka hloka molato le ka mohla.
However, he agreed.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a lumela.
I do not want problems.	Ha ke batle mathata.
So stop.	Kahoo ema.
That, in the first place.	Seo, sebakeng sa pele.
I just asked.	Ke sa tsoa botsa.
There was no reason.	Ho ne ho se na lebaka.
It still works.	E ntse e sebetsa.
I see.	Kea bona.
We don't know what it is.	Ha re tsebe hore na ke eng.
He said he needed more time.	O ile a re o hloka nako e ngata.
Maybe someone should try to talk to her.	Mohlomong motho e mong o lokela ho leka ho bua le eena.
It was a lot of fun to play.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo ho bapala.
Just look down.	Sheba fatše feela.
I refused to talk to him.	Ke ile ka hana ho bua le eena.
He asked after Mother's life.	O ile a botsa ka mor'a bophelo ba 'Mè.
I didn't have to say anything.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho bua letho.
Books will come to you now.	Libuka li tla fihla ho uena hona joale.
He is driving.	O ntse a khanna.
Everything that was not going to happen happened.	Lintho tsohle tse neng li sa tl’o etsahala li ile tsa etsahala.
All the guy did was talk.	Sohle seo mohlankana a se entseng e ne e le ho bua.
I did not realize.	Ha kea ka ka hlokomela.
But she will be fine.	Empa o tla phela hantle.
He saw that it worked and wondered how.	O ne a bona hore e sebetsa mme a ipotsa hore na joang.
This is a wonderful party.	Ena ke mokete o monate.
He was not sure until now.	O ne a eso be le bonnete ho fihlela jwale.
Thanks for coming.	Ke leboha ho tla.
Mom is preparing dinner.	'Mè o ntse a lokisa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
A woman does not have to be beautiful.	Ha ho hlokahale hore mosali a be motle.
I have my way.	Ke na le tsela ea ka.
Like him.	Joalo ka eena.
Our teacher told us not to forget the important things.	Tichere ea rōna e ile ea re bolella hore re se ke ra lebala lintho tsa bohlokoa.
I didn't start like that, you know.	Ha kea qala joalo, ua tseba.
This was not easy for one of us.	Sena se ne se se bonolo ho e mong oa rōna.
We do this work every day.	Re etsa mosebetsi ona letsatsi le letsatsi.
I like that you just want to work.	Ke rata hore o batla ho sebetsa feela.
The same is true for other days.	Ho joalo ka matsatsi a mang.
But, you see.	Empa, ua bona.
You think.	U nahana.
One was a young man who was studying.	E mong e ne e le mohlankana ea neng a ithuta.
Now he is no longer difficult.	Joale ha a sa le thata.
We can only go first.	Re ka ea pele feela.
Maybe that will help.	Mohlomong seo se tla thusa.
Although they wanted to return home they would not have done so.	Leha ba ne ba batla ho khutlela hae ba ka be ba sa ka ba etsa joalo.
She enjoyed the dog.	O ile a thabela ntja.
No, we did not.	Che, ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
And we're going to get there.	Mme re ya fihla moo.
Whatever it is, it will be.	Eng kapa eng e tla ba teng, e tla ba teng.
They may not pay close attention to it.	Ba ka 'na ba se ke ba e hlokomela ka hloko.
They are right where you are.	Ba hantle moo o leng teng.
When you get there, lie down and sit down.	Ha u fihla moo, robala 'me u lule fatše.
It was not an easy process.	E ne e se mokhoa o bonolo.
This did not happen.	Sena ha sea etsahala.
Good thing, such a pain.	Ntho e ntle, bohloko bo joalo.
Please call to see if it exists.	Ka kopo letsetsa ho bona hore na e teng.
He must have been like that.	E tlameha ebe o ne a le jwalo.
But they are not good.	Empa ha li ntle.
Neither can we.	Le rona re ke ke ra ba teng.
He did not have time to think about his decision.	O ne a se na nako ea ho nahana ka qeto ea hae.
The first ones would be our family.	Ba pele e ne e tla ba lelapa la rōna.
We never want to go.	Ha ho mohla re batlang ho tsamaea.
Then three more.	Ebe tse ling tse tharo.
I did not look down.	Ha kea ka ka sheba fatše.
I know it will not be easy.	Kea tseba hore ho ka se be bonolo.
However this trend does not seem strong.	Leha ho le joalo mokhoa ona ha o bonahale ka matla.
It was not a matter of knowing.	E ne e se taba ya ho tseba.
In fact, you played well last season.	Ha e le hantle, u ile ua bapala hantle nakong ea ho qetela.
I will never know.	Ha ke sa tla tseba.
We treated them the same way.	Re ile ra ba tšoara ka tsela e tšoanang.
The day was the same day.	Letsatsi e ne e le letsatsi le tšoanang.
You heard about it.	Le utloile ka eona.
I know enough.	Ke tseba ho lekana.
Probably his whole week.	Mohlomong beke eohle ea hae.
Do everything right.	Etsa tsohle hantle.
I had met him several times before.	Ke ne ke kile ka kopana le eena makhetlo a 'maloa pele.
And here we are.	Mme ke rona bana.
That would be strange.	Seo e ka ba ntho e makatsang.
After we ate, we left.	Ha re qeta ho ja, re ile ra tsamaea.
He did not expect that.	O ne a sa lebella seo.
He could not meet.	O ne a sa khone ho kopana.
We just want to hear what we want to hear.	Re batla feela ho utloa seo re batlang ho se utloa.
There was no place for it.	Ho ne ho se sebaka sa eona.
They are thinking people.	Ke batho ba nahanang.
He did it because he could.	O e entse hobane a ne a ka khona.
We must be good at doing this.	Re tlameha ho ba hantle ho etsa sena.
Today is a school day and a day of work.	Kajeno ke letsatsi la sekolo le letsatsi la mosebetsi.
You have to make the best decision for the team.	U tlameha ho etsa qeto e ntle ka ho fetisisa bakeng sa sehlopha.
Then just sleep there.	Ebe o robala moo feela.
All about you.	Tsohle ka wena.
You never asked him for anything.	Ha o eso ka o mo kopa letho.
He did not stay home with the children enough.	Ha aa ka a lula hae le bana ho lekana.
They just talk, and everyone is happy.	Ba bua feela, mme bohle ba thabile.
Not in front of them, but behind them.	E seng ka pele, empa ka morao ho bona.
But it does catch you.	Empa ea u tšoara.
Some of them had things to say.	Ba bang ba bona ba ne ba e-na le lintho tseo ba lokelang ho li bua.
I was good to you.	Ke ne ke le molemo ho uena.
I agreed and started writing.	Ke ile ka lumela eaba ke qala ho ngola.
If not we use this method again.	Haeba ho se joalo re sebelisa mokhoa ona hape.
I have my life and it is more than enough.	Ke na le bophelo ba ka 'me bo feta bo lekaneng.
It was a kind of water police.	E ne e le mofuta o mong oa mapolesa a metsi.
It was a wonderful day.	E ne e le letsatsi le monate haholo.
For many, that is probably not the case.	Ho ba bangata, mohlomong ha ho joalo.
We will do a good thing.	Re tlo etsa ntho e ntle.
He did not even want to take his car.	O ne a sa batle le ho nka koloi ea hae.
Very, very.	Haholo, haholo.
Don't be in that group.	O seke wa ba sehlopheng seo.
For a long time.	Ka nako e telele.
This they do.	Sena ba se etsa.
It will tell you.	E tla o bolella.
This looks like a great opportunity.	Sena se shebahala e le monyetla o motle.
Of course it will.	Ehlile ho tla ba joalo.
She never understood that it didn't matter to me.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a utloisisa hore ha ho na taba ho 'na.
I have never met one of them.	Ha ke eso kopane le e mong wa bona.
That was not my request.	Eo e ne e se kopo ea ka.
I got it.	Ke e fumane.
No one expected him to live.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a lebeletse hore o tla phela.
It's very simple.	E bonolo haholo.
He just loved to play.	O ne a rata ho bapala feela.
Along with others.	Hammoho le ba bang.
He felt his strength.	O ne a utloa matla a hae.
Eventually she decides to look for a man instead.	Qetellong o etsa qeto ea ho batla monna ho e-na le hoo.
The woman returned home.	Mosali eo a khutlela hae.
And children.	Le bana.
She may have been crying.	E ka ’na eaba o ne a lla.
I don't have one of them.	Ha ke na e 'ngoe ea tsona.
It was delicious food.	E ne e le lijo tse monate.
Maybe that’s the way to buy time.	Mohlomong eo ke tsela ea ho reka nako.
Of course, we need to find out what we can get.	Ha e le hantle, re hloka ho fumana hore na re ka fumana eng.
After that, travel will be easier.	Ka mor'a moo, ho tsamaea ho tla ba bonolo.
I see the problem.	Ke bona bothata.
Everyone comes in.	Bohle baa kena.
They will take care of him.	Ba tla mo hlokomela.
That is, it will take a long time.	Ke hore e tla nka nako e telele.
That is why I asked.	Ke kahoo ke ileng ka botsa.
Something you need to know.	Ntho eo o hlokang ho e tseba.
He will be playing.	O tla be a bapala.
Once we enter.	Hang ha re kena.
I've never seen that man before.	Ha ke eso bone monna eo pele.
Spend time with family.	Qeta nako le lelapa.
In fact, she has a baby.	Ha e le hantle, o na le ngoana.
I went in and found her preparing dinner.	Ke ile ka kena ka fumana a ntse a lokisa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
We often eat together.	Hangata re ja hammoho.
I did not understand that.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise seo.
Like us.	Joalo ka rona.
You can do this in your own way.	U ka etsa sena ka tsela ea hau.
I have one.	Ke na le e 'ngoe.
Money speaks.	Chelete ea bua.
I am very busy.	Ke phathahane haholo.
They feel useless.	Ba ikutloa hore ha a na thuso.
She looked beautiful.	O ne a shebahala a le motle.
And so, we think, it was.	'Me ho joalo, re nahana, ho ne ho le joalo.
He has been a great help.	O bile thuso.
He could not get help there.	O ne a ke ke a fumana thuso moo.
I had done something very wrong.	Ke ne ke entse ntho e mpe haholo.
But it was time for him to leave.	Empa e ne e le nako ea hore a tsamaee.
What you did well.	Seo u se entseng hantle.
You wanted to be with them.	U ne u batla ho ba le bona.
Ask questions, ask if you can see the parents.	Botsa lipotso, botsa hore na u ka tla bona batsoali.
He was with me.	O ne a na le nna.
He could ask for help.	O ne a ka kopa thuso.
And that's where my problem is.	Mme ke hona moo bothata ba ka bo leng teng.
I refuse, though.	Ke hana, leha ho le joalo.
We will not talk more than that.	Ha re tlo bua ho feta moo.
I'm not sure what he is waiting for.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na o emetse eng.
Better yet maybe.	Ho molemo le ho feta mohlomong.
The police came.	Mapolesa a ile a tla.
He can be a very tough man.	E ka ba monna ya thata haholo.
The second issue speaks volumes about this.	Taba ea bobeli e bua haholo ka taba ena.
It has never been more important.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba oa bohlokoa.
How can I fix this.	Nka lokisa sena joang.
He didn't just know it by heart.	O ne a sa tsebe feela ka hlooho.
You just have to watch it.	U lokela ho e shebella feela.
I hope not.	Ke tšepa hore ha ho joalo.
Otherwise, you do not understand.	Ntle ho moo, ha u utloisise.
Hard water, maybe.	Metsi a thata, mohlomong.
What is wrong with us.	Phoso ke efe ho re re.
It's my first day on the job.	Ke letsatsi la ka la pele mosebetsing.
I began to see how this thing would come together.	Ke ile ka qala ho bona hore na ntho ena e tla kopana joang.
Why not do it again?	Ke hobane'ng ha u sa etse joalo hape?
But today it is not easy.	Empa kajeno ha ho bonolo.
That person was me.	Motho eo e ne e le ’na.
See you soon.	Ke tla u bona haufinyane.
No, money is not everything.	Che, chelete ha se ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
I think it was.	Ke nahana hore ho ne ho le jwalo.
I've seen this a lot.	Ke bone sena haholo.
You need a boy's name.	O hloka lebitso la moshanyana.
Most people have children.	Batho ba bangata ba na le bana.
He wrote a letter.	O ile a ngola lengolo.
He did it anyway.	O ile a e etsa leha ho le joalo.
Yes, this is just your issue.	E, sena ke taba ea hau feela.
I would like help.	Nka thabela thuso.
But the night was even harder.	Empa bosiu bo ne bo le boima le ho feta.
The fourth was empty.	Ea bone e ne e se na letho.
He decided not to call her again.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore a se ke a mo letsetsa hape.
If you think you can do it, you will do it.	Haeba u nahana hore u ka e etsa, u tla e etsa.
He learns it.	O a e ithuta.
I really like to understand why.	Ke hlile ke rata ho utloisisa lebaka.
They talk about us.	Ba bua ka rona.
But it will take hard work and time.	Empa ho tla nka mosebetsi o boima le nako.
We can go in, things can come out.	Re ka kena, lintho li ka tsoa.
We are happy about that.	Re thabile ka hona.
You wanted me to do that.	U ne u batla hore ke etse joalo.
We do what we do, and then we live by it.	Re etsa seo re se etsang, ebe re phela le sona.
What you have said does not make sense.	Seo u se buileng ha se na kelello.
She loves to read and travel.	O rata ho bala le ho tsamaea.
Good team.	Sehlopha se setle.
But you know.	Empa uena ua tseba.
Maybe they come in and go back.	Mohlomong ba kena 'me ba khutlela morao.
We'll see you again next time.	Re tla u bona hape nakong e tlang.
This was a very difficult decision for me.	Ena e ne e le qeto e boima haholo ho ’na.
You may have seen them.	Mohlomong u kile ua li bona.
We can fix the player.	Re ka lokisa sebapali.
Except for one man.	Ntle le monna a le mong.
It was just a problem.	E ne e le bothata feela.
She thought she was a girl.	O ne a nka hore ke ngoanana.
He began to think again.	O ile a qala ho nahana hape.
But life can be difficult on your own, you know.	Empa bophelo bo ka ba boima u le mong, ua tseba.
We have to think about what they might see.	Re tlameha ho nahana ka seo ba ka 'nang ba se bona.
They were always fixing things in the end, though.	Ba ne ba lula ba lokisa lintho qetellong, leha ho le joalo.
So, we were there.	Kahoo, re ne re le teng.
They finished the job ahead of time.	Ba ile ba qeta mosebetsi pele ho nako.
It can be weird.	E ka ba ntho e makatsang.
He went into his house.	A kena ha hae.
Well, this is somehow true.	Be, sena ke 'nete ka mokhoa o itseng.
Such things happen here.	Lintho tse joalo li etsahala mona.
All the time, I was waiting there.	Ka linako tsohle, ke ne ke emetse moo.
He couldn't say yes, and he didn't want to say no.	O ne a sitoa ho re e, a bile a sa batle ho hana.
Now we don't need you anymore.	Joale ha re sa u hloka.
I will pass.	Ke tla feta.
But they have to do it.	Empa ba tlameha ho etsa joalo.
Think long and hard.	Nahana ka nako e telele le ka thata.
He said when he did it.	O itse ha a e etsa.
I do not know how to start.	Ha ke tsebe hore na nka e qala joang.
I didn't care at all.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle ho hang.
He cares for his people.	O hlokomela batho ba hae.
I think I love you.	Ke nahana hore kea u rata.
He wanted to have something to say when he saw them.	O ne a batla ho ba le seo a ka se buang ha a ba bona.
It stopped as fast as it could.	E ile ea ema kapele kamoo e ka khonang.
I like it too.	Le eona ke e rata.
Drink things, don't just look at them.	Noa lintho, u se ke ua li sheba feela.
I will consider this further.	Ke tla nahana ka sena ho ea pele.
He wished he could do that.	O ne a lakatsa eka a ka etsa joalo.
Like a teacher.	Nka ba tichere.
It was a good time for me.	E bile nako e ntle ho nna.
It is better to do without it.	Ho molemo ho etsa ntle le eona.
In the past, many have had it.	Nakong e fetileng, ba bangata ba bile le eona.
We want to help you.	Re batla ho o thusa.
I wish they could know that.	Ke lakatsa eka ba ka tseba seo.
Simple but fresh.	E bonolo empa e le ncha.
We became friends.	Re ile ra ba metsoalle.
This book is very old, not easy to read.	Buka ena ke ea khale haholo, ha ho bonolo ho e bala.
Do you see that boy?	O ya bona moshanyana eo?
We've got some, but it's hard.	Re fumane tse ling, empa ho thata.
This or that is nothing.	Ke sena kapa ha ho letho.
I couldn't call until now.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho letsa ho fihlela joale.
And this too was uncertain.	Mme le hona ho ne ho se na bonnete.
They were not his friends.	E ne e se metsoalle ea hae.
There was nothing before that man.	Ho ne ho se letho pele ho monna eo.
It will happen.	Ho tla etsahala.
I get there.	Ke fihla moo.
He really did not want to go back to it.	O ne a hlile a sa batle ho khutlela ho eona.
Invisible.	Ho sa bonahale.
Besides, he knew it could not be true.	Ntle ho moo, o ne a tseba hore e ke ke ea e-ba 'nete.
They do not want you to know anything about them.	Ha ba rate hore o tsebe letho ka bona.
They can be very dangerous.	Li ka ba kotsi haholo.
She cried and cried.	A lla a lla.
If they did not like her son, they could leave.	Haeba ba ne ba sa rate mora oa hae, ba ne ba ka tsamaea.
These will be difficult, but they are there	Tsena li tla ba thata, empa li teng
Some of us went in as a group.	Ba bang ba rōna re ne re kena re le sehlopha.
I will not.	nke ke ka etsa joalo.
He has been here a long time.	E se e le nako e telele a le mona.
There was ample time to travel.	Ho ne ho e-na le nako e lekaneng ea ho tsamaea.
He was never absent when needed.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba sieo ha ho hlokahala.
I was very tired, but it was good.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo, empa ho bile molemo.
However he did this with her in a good way.	Leha ho le joalo o ile a etsa sena le eena ka tsela e ntle.
He said the child is news.	A re ngoana ke litaba.
It was a long time coming.	E ne e le nako e telele e tlang.
They were the ones guilty, you know.	Ke bona ba neng ba na le molato, le a tseba.
One must know.	Motho o tlameha ho tseba.
There were some kids who didn’t get what the evening was like.	Ho ne ho e-na le bana ba bang ba sa kang ba fumana seo mantsiboea a neng a le sona.
Very good at that.	E ntle haholo ho seo.
To do this, we need people.	Ho etsa sena, re hloka batho.
He wants to help them.	O batla ho ba thusa.
Some had heard the news.	Ba bang ba ne ba utloile litaba tseo.
Stop here, please.	Ema mona ka kopo.
More money than that.	Chelete e ngata ho feta.
None of that is a problem.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tseo e leng bothata.
I hope it doesn't last too long.	Ke tšepa hore e ke ke ea nka nako e telele haholo.
This was it.	Sena e ne e le sona.
Or wait until tomorrow morning.	Kapa ema ho fihlela hosane hoseng.
Playing is work.	Ho bapala ke mosebetsi.
That should not be the case.	Seo ha sea lokela ho ba taba.
That would not be necessary, indeed.	Hoo ho ke ke ha hlokahala, ruri.
I mean, good.	Ke bolela, e ntle.
The fall was like that.	Ho oa ho ne ho le joalo.
There will be no more.	Ha ho sa tla ba teng.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Ha ho letho, ha ho letho, ha ho letho.
You get what you need, and you have to suffer.	U fumana seo u se hlokang, 'me o tlameha ho utloa bohloko.
Then he left.	Eaba oa tsamaea.
There would be a better time.	Ho ne ho tla ba le nako e betere.
He was a strange man.	E ne e le motho ea makatsang.
We can even say while you are still driving.	Re ka ba ra re ha u sa ntse u khanna koloi.
Good, but also dangerous.	E ntle, empa hape e kotsi.
And this can be beneficial, of course.	'Me sena se ka re tsoela molemo, ho hlakile.
If you take too long, people will not stand here.	Haeba u nka nako e telele, batho ba ke ke ba ema mona.
I'm so sorry about that.	Ke masoabi haholo ka seo.
He left without saying a word.	O ile a tsamaea a sa bua letho.
You are very much needed.	U hlokahala haholo.
There is no such thing.	Ha ho letho la mofuta oo.
This is useful in the future.	Sena se na le thuso nakong e tlang.
He knew one of them.	O ne a tseba e mong oa bona.
Now is the time to start doing well.	Joale ke nako ea ho qala ho etsa hantle.
You never have to deal with it any other way.	Ha ho mohla u hlokang ho sebetsa le eona ka tsela e 'ngoe.
But he did not know anyone.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe motho.
Because, one, we have nothing like this.	Hobane, e mong, ha re na ntho e kang ena.
He became even heavier.	O ile a ba boima le ho feta.
He can help here.	A ka thusa ka mona.
Most of us love it that way.	Ba bangata ba rona re e rata ka tsela eo.
Maybe you don't.	Mohlomong ha u etse joalo.
That didn't help, of course.	Seo ha se a ka sa thusa, ehlile.
I found out exactly where the book was going.	Ke ile ka fumana ho hlakile hore na buka eo e ea kae.
All of this seemed like good news.	Tsena tsohle li ne li bonahala e le litaba tse monate.
I'm sure it wasn't.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ho ne ho se joalo.
However, so far this has not happened.	Leha ho le joalo, ho fihlela joale sena ha se e-so ka se etsahala.
Going forward and on.	Ho ea pele le ho ea pele.
I need to ride a bike.	Ke hloka ho palama baesekele.
What made you decide to write a book?	Ke eng e entseng hore u nke qeto ea ho ngola buka?
He gives you your place.	O o fa sebaka sa hao.
You have to think it through carefully.	U tlameha ho e nahana ka hloko.
Same thing every day.	Ntho e tšoanang letsatsi le letsatsi.
People are afraid to ask for help.	Batho ba tšaba ho kopa thuso.
It was the last one.	E ne e le ea ho qetela.
We must also look at the work that it does.	Hape re tlameha ho sheba mosebetsi oo e o etsang.
However, do not buy it.	Leha ho le joalo, u se ke ua e reka.
The man opened it.	Monna a bula.
And more to come.	Le tse ngata tse tlang.
And we need more than that.	'Me re hloka ho feta moo.
Whatever you think.	Eng kapa eng eo o e nahanang.
I can't get in.	Ha ke khone ho kena.
Have a baby.	E-ba le ngoana.
Then you could buy whatever you wanted.	Joale u ne u ka reka seo u se batlang.
You only see what you want.	U bona feela seo u se batlang.
You work on what you want.	U sebetsa ho seo u se batlang.
He was not sure what to do.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na o tla etsa eng.
Do not talk about him in the background.	U se ke ua bua ka eena ka morao.
We left before we finished.	Re ile ra tsamaea pele re qeta.
I thought I knew.	Ke ne ke nahana hore kea tseba.
At one point he could not believe that it could happen.	Ka lekhetlo le leng o ne a ke ke a lumela hore ho ka etsahala.
Decide and go.	Etsa qeto 'me u tsamaee.
I know you are very close to him.	Kea tseba hore u se u le haufi haholo le eena.
We will eat together.	Re tla ja hammoho.
I bought that picture.	Ke reka setšoantšo seo.
I still have some very good friends at that wonderful time.	Ke ntse ke e-na le metsoalle e molemo haholo ea nakong eo e monate.
We have a work to do.	Re na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa.
And in the end, the law might help him.	’Me qetellong molao o ka ’na oa mo thusa.
The phone rings, it rings.	Mohala oa lla, oa lla.
This is the best.	Ena ke eona e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
I had seen this before but it was years ago.	Ke ne ke bone sena pele empa e ne e le lilemo tse fetileng.
He wished he could never do that.	O ne a lakatsa eka a ke ke a etsa joalo.
But time is running out.	Empa nako e se e ile.
But they are trying to do it.	Empa ba leka ho e etsa.
I think that would be fun.	Ke nahana hore hoo ho tla ba monate.
The reason is emotional.	Lebaka ke la maikutlo.
It seems clear to us that there is.	Ho bonahala ho hlakile ho rona hore ho na le.
Doing so is no longer practical.	Ho etsa joalo ha ho sa na thuso.
Sometimes it helps a little.	Ka linako tse ling o thusa hanyane.
I don't know what's going to happen.	Ha ke tsebe se tlang ho etsahala.
I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.	Ha ke re ho na le phoso efe kapa efe ea seo.
I did not say it.	Ha kea e bolela.
We do not know what they want.	Ha re tsebe seo ba se batlang.
I was there you know.	Ke ne ke le teng oa tseba.
That will not happen at all.	Hoo ho ke ke ha etsahala ho hang.
It is not right to do so.	Ha se hantle ho etsa joalo.
Which is not a good thing.	E leng hore ha se ntho e ntle.
We did not like that.	Ha rea ​​ka ra rata seo.
Sometimes, it's just a matter of necessity.	Ka linako tse ling, ke taba feela ea ho tlameha.
These are important things to know.	Tsena ke lintho tsa bohlokoa ho tseba.
Nothing was missing.	Ntho e ne e le sieo.
They are ours.	Ke tsa rona.
Nobody does that.	Ha ho motho ea etsang joalo.
If he could, he would not want to feel that way again.	Haeba a ne a ka khona, o ne a sa batle ho ikutloa ka tsela eo hape.
I have had a problem for a long time.	Ke bile le bothata ka nako e telele.
That does it all.	Seo se etsa sohle.
Your husband loved you, yes.	Monna oa hao o ne a u rata, e.
I will try it.	Ke tla e leka.
Thank you very much.	Ke ba leboha haholo.
He knew the type.	O ne a tseba mofuta.
We took each other.	Re ile ra nka e mong le e mong ho e mong.
We were doing something that no team had ever done.	Re ne re etsa ntho eo ho seng sehlopha se kileng sa e etsa.
There was so much going on.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang.
Now we have found it.	Joale re e fumane.
Do not read too much.	U se ke ua li bala haholo.
Or for that matter, that it happened.	Kapa bakeng sa taba eo, hore e bile teng.
But he would do what he could.	Empa o ne a tla etsa sohle seo a ka se khonang.
And it will not be.	'Me ho ke ke ha e-ba teng.
I'm happy to stay.	Ke thabetse ho lula.
Easy to do, but very fun.	Ho bonolo ho e etsa, empa e monate haholo.
I could not live with guilt.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho phela le molato.
, caring for her.	, ho mo hlokomela.
I have been there.	Ke bile teng.
I saw his stuff.	Ke bone ntho tsa hae.
Then decide what you want to do.	Ebe u etsa qeto ea hore na u batla ho etsa eng.
We can assume that there is some truth here.	Re ka nka hore ho na le 'nete e itseng mona.
I just bought a new house.	Ke sa tsoa reka ntlo e ncha.
How would he know?	O ne a tla tseba joang?
I did not want to leave.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho tsamaea.
The opening ceremony was fun.	Mokete oa ho bula o ne o le monate.
It's difficult.	Ho thata.
He was not sure who he was.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke mang.
We cannot live together.	Re ke ke ra phela hammoho.
You have to know it well.	U tlameha ho e tseba hantle.
There was a lot of crying that night.	Ho ile ha lla haholo bosiung boo.
It did not exist before.	E ne e se teng pele ho moo.
Is there a mistake there, really.	Na ho na le sebaka sa phoso moo, ruri.
They have no such idea.	Ha ba na maikutlo a joalo.
And she didn't know him very well.	Mme o ne a sa mo tsebe hantle hakaalo.
You are still here for a reason.	U ntse u le mona ka lebaka.
I mean, people are not sure.	Ke bolela, batho ha ba na bonnete.
It is dangerous to swim.	Ho kotsi ho sesa.
You will probably be fine.	Mohlomong u tla phela hantle.
I made a mistake.	Ke entse phoso.
Maybe we can do it next time in my bedroom.	Mohlomong re ka e etsa nakong e tlang ka kamoreng ea ka ea ho robala.
Maybe you will win.	Mohlomong u tla hlola.
It is sad to think of her life as such.	Ho bohloko ho nahana ka bophelo ba hae bo joalo.
But you see, if they are looking, then they are not sure.	Empa le a bona, haeba ba ntse ba sheba, jwale ha ba na bonnete.
There was no nameless person.	Ho ne ho se motho ea se nang lebitso.
Write that book.	Ngola buka eo.
I just wanted to say thank you so much.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho leboha haholo.
Everyone is happy, very happy.	E mong le e mong o thabile, o thabile haholo.
It is important.	E bohlokoa.
They did not leave on time.	Ha baa ka ba tsoa ka nako.
It is stronger than it ever was.	E matla ho feta kamoo e kileng ea ba teng.
It was hard work.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima.
If he could get help, it would not come from him.	Haeba a ne a ka fumana thuso, e ne e ke ke ea tsoa ho eena.
you ask.	ua botsa.
He's very good at talking about anything.	O motle haholo ho bua ka eng kapa eng.
No man spoke.	Ha ho monna ea ileng a bua.
If you can imagine that.	Ha o ka nahana seo.
Things like that.	Lintho tse joalo.
Neither is it.	Le eona ha se eona.
They met once a week for three hours.	E ne e kopana hang ka beke ka lihora tse tharo.
It needs to be important.	E hloka ho ba ea bohlokoa.
Now he could do it.	Joale o ne a khona ho e etsa.
You have to take that risk.	O lokela ho nka kotsi eo.
We had to leave quickly.	Re ne re tlameha ho tsamaea kapele.
They are just beautiful.	Li ntle feela.
Really? 	Ehlile?
I don't like it here anymore.	Ha ke sa e rata mona.
Nothing happened here.	Ha ho letho le etsahetseng mona.
I will look for him.	Ke tla mo batla.
And there is nothing wrong with that.	Mme ho hang ha ho letho le phoso ka seo.
It doesn't matter at all.	Ha ho na taba ho hang.
He could not walk.	O ne a sitoa ho tsamaea.
I really like it.	Ke e rata haholo.
Great, but simple.	O moholo, empa o bonolo.
I know people do that.	Kea tseba hore batho ba etsa joalo.
They've been here a very long time.	Ba bile mona nako e telele haholo.
It is able to walk, swim and ride a bike.	E khona ho tseba ho tsamaea, ho sesa le ho palama baesekele.
But my feelings would be heavy.	Empa maikutlo a ka a ne a tla ba boima.
That would be fun.	Hoo ho ka ba monate.
If they can win, you give.	Haeba ba ka hlola, u fana.
It is very powerful.	E matla haholo.
You may not need any of them.	U ka 'na ua se ke ua hloka leha e le efe ea tsona.
It’s kind of a daily commute, really.	Ke mofuta oa ho tsamaea letsatsi le letsatsi, ka 'nete.
I did not come to anyone.	Ha kea ka ka tla ho mang kapa mang.
His parents made him find a way to pay for it.	Batsoali ba hae ba ile ba etsa hore a fumane mokhoa oa ho lefa ho e lokisa.
Maybe someone will find it useful.	Mohlomong motho e mong o tla e fumana e le molemo.
The reason is so many people.	Lebaka ke batho ba bangata haholo.
However, it has its drawbacks.	Leha ho le joalo, e na le mathata.
This provides.	Sena se fana ka .
But only to him.	Empa ho eena feela.
It won't be the last one, but he still doesn't know.	E ke ke ea e-ba oa ho qetela, empa ha a e-s'o tsebe.
No problems of any kind.	Ha ho mathata a mofuta ofe kapa ofe.
You are an amazing father.	U ntate ea makatsang.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
For the first time without children.	Lekhetlo la pele ntle le bana.
I did not understand how.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hore na joang.
He did not refuse.	Ha a ka a hana.
He walked down the street as he spoke.	O ile a tsamaea ka tsela ha a ntse a bua.
That's the way things are.	Ke kamoo lintho li leng kateng.
They decided to do this.	Ba ile ba etsa qeto ea ho etsa sena.
So he told them.	Kahoo a ba bolella.
But it is good nonetheless.	Empa e ntle leha ho le joalo.
I did not see anyone nearby.	Ha kea ka ka bona motho haufi.
None of us can.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea ka khonang.
Except no one knew when that would happen.	Ntle le ha ho motho ea neng a tseba hore na seo se tla etsahala neng.
He rejected the offer.	O ile a hana tlhahiso eo.
It's really close here.	Ehlile e haufi mona.
It was certainly timely.	Ka sebele e ne e le nakong.
For this, you have to make a decision.	Bakeng sa sena, o tlameha ho etsa qeto.
Some knew very well.	Ba bang ba ne ba tseba hantle haholo.
She is very shy.	O lihlong haholo.
You have a problem now!	O na le bothata hona joale!
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
They were my friends.	E ne e le metsoalle ea ka.
So she and her husband came.	Kahoo eena le monna oa hae ba tla.
He always made sure to thank her for her help.	Kamehla o ne a etsa bonnete ba hore o mo leboha ka thuso ea hae.
However, they do not really love him.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ba mo rate hakaalo.
I wish it were fun.	Ke kopa hore e be monate.
It is bad and it will be difficult for us.	E mpe 'me e tla ba thata ho rona.
I could not sleep for hours.	Ke ile ka qeta lihora ke sa robala.
See what happens.	Bona se etsahalang.
We have a delicious dinner.	Re ja lijo tsa mantsiboea tse monate.
You thought no one knew.	U ne u nahana hore ha ho motho ea tsebang.
My mother spoke up.	'Mè o ile a bua litaba ka bonolo.
I think he came out just fine.	Ke nahana hore o tsoa hantle feela.
They've all been here.	Bohle ba bile teng mona.
I had already made up my mind.	Ke ne ke se ke entse qeto.
You have to take the proposal.	O lokela ho nka tlhahiso.
I love him more than life.	Ke mo rata ho feta bophelo.
He is also present.	O teng hape.
Although very simple.	Leha e le bonolo haholo.
And he sat down.	Mme a dula .
They never got in and out of the day.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba fumana le ho tsoa ka letsatsi.
The first one is the best.	Ea pele e molemo ka ho fetisisa.
There was a good time here.	Ho kile ha ba le nako e monate mona.
So we have to ask who we are talking about.	Kahoo re tlameha ho botsa hore na re bua ka bophelo ba mang.
That is where my strength will be.	Ke hona moo matla a ka a tlang ho ba teng.
I understood him well.	Ke ne ke mo utloisisa hantle.
I did it before.	Ke e entse pele.
He was back again today.	O bile morao hape kajeno.
All of this takes time.	Sena sohle se nka nako.
But there is a reason why they are no longer there.	Empa ho na le lebaka leo ka lona ba seng ba le sieo.
It was not that kind.	E ne e se mofuta oo.
Ask someone to do something.	Kopa motho ho etsa ho hong.
There is something good you need to know.	Ho na le ntho e ntle eo u lokelang ho e tseba.
He saw the opportunity.	O ile a bona monyetla oo.
He did it.	O e entse.
They travel together.	Ba tsamaea hammoho.
He could never get into it.	Le ka mohla o ne a sa khone ho kena ho eona.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
I hope the good stuff.	Ke tšepa lintho tse ntle.
He had done that.	O ne a entse seo.
I had both.	Ke ne ke na le tsona ka bobeli.
The reality of modern life.	'Nete ea bophelo ba kajeno.
Maybe you did.	Mohlomong u entse joalo.
Very easy to use.	Ho bonolo haholo ho sebelisa.
I am very happy with myself.	Ke thabile haholo ka 'na.
But it is better to do it sooner.	Empa ho molemo ho e etsa kapele.
It was easier than him.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho feta ho eena.
He was afraid not to do so.	O ne a tšaba ho se etse joalo.
I had so many other things to do.	Ke ne ke e-na le lintho tse ling tse ngata tseo ke lokelang ho li etsa.
This was true.	Sena e ne e le 'nete.
His mind could not work it out.	Kelello ea hae e ne e sa khone ho e sebetsa.
I need to settle the matter with you.	Ke hloka ho lokisa taba eo le uena.
Maybe he could have lived better without her.	Mohlomong o ne a ka phela hantle ntle le eena.
You will love him or not.	U tla mo rata kapa u se ke ua mo rata.
I felt the same way.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
I held it close.	Ke ile ka e tšoara haufi.
But wait.	Empa ema.
They arrived home after the party.	Ba fihla hae ka mor’a mokete.
They seemed to love him very much.	Ba ne ba bonahala ba mo rata haholo.
The question is how to do it.	Potso ke mokhoa oa ho etsa joalo.
Even if you know better.	Leha o tseba betere.
No, he was not.	Che, o ne a se hantle.
However, there are none other than a few nice clothes.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho tse ling ntle le liaparo tse seng kae tse ntle.
I can't do this.	Ha ke khone ho etsa sena.
Truth is never important.	'Nete ha ho mohla e bohlokoa.
I could watch for hours and hours.	Ke ne ke khona ho shebella lihora le lihora.
There he is.	Ke eo moo.
I did not ask for this.	Ke ne ke sa kopa sena.
To say.	Ea ho bolela.
Yes, several times.	E, ka makhetlo a 'maloa.
He ate nothing.	O ne a sa je letho.
They did hard work.	Ba ile ba etsa mosebetsi o boima.
No one knows what will happen next.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na ho ka etsahala eng ka mor'a moo.
This was nothing.	Sena se ne se se na letho.
This is already happening.	Sena se se se ntse se etsahala.
It does not require much thought.	Ha ho hloke ho nahana haholo.
That's a strange thing.	Ke taba e makatsang.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
We want to reach more people.	Re batla ho fihla ho batho ba bangata.
He was too busy thinking to speak.	O ne a phathahane haholo a nahana ho bua.
That wasn't so good.	Seo se ne se se ntle hakaalo.
And he got what he was looking for.	Mme a bona seo a neng a se lebeletse.
It's bedtime.	Ke nako ea ho robala.
But it would be fun.	Empa ho ne ho tla ba monate.
I know you want him.	Kea tseba hore oa mo batla.
And keep thinking.	'Me u lule u nahana.
It is very important.	E bohlokoa haholo.
I felt very happy.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke thabile haholo.
Some work better than others.	Ba bang ba sebetsa hantle ho feta ba bang.
It's a really good thing, very good.	Ke ntho e ntle ruri, e ntle haholo.
Of course, he never said that in the presence of my father.	Ehlile ha ho mohla a kileng a bua joalo ha Ntate a le teng.
I have never done anything like this before.	Ha ke so ka ke etsa ntho e kang ena pele.
I just talked to my mom.	Ke qeta ho bua le mme.
It's my job.	Ke mosebetsi oa ka.
The rest of the.	Tse ling kaofela tsa.
I want to say something.	Ke batla ho bua ho hong.
Then he wondered.	Eaba oa ipotsa.
He said they were heavy.	A re ba boima.
Maybe, maybe we can.	Mohlomong, mohlomong re ka khona.
He was still in great pain.	O ne a ntse a utloile bohloko haholo.
I probably would never have read this otherwise.	Mohlomong le ka mohla nka be ke sa bala sena ho seng joalo.
I was the only one who knew where he was, you see.	Ke ne ke le mong feela ya tsebang moo a leng teng, o a bona.
I know what it takes to win.	Kea tseba hore na ho hlokahala eng ho hlola.
People know these things when they hear them, he says.	Batho ba tseba lintho tsena ha ba li utloa, o re.
He had the most amazing hands.	O ne a e-na le matsoho a makatsang ka ho fetisisa.
I still want it.	Ke ntse ke e batla.
I hear things.	Ke utloa lintho.
I think it’s fun, it’s really fun.	Ke nahana hore ho monate, ho monate haholo.
I go to him.	Ke ea ho eena.
That player should never work again.	Sebapali seo ha sea lokela ho sebetsa hape.
He didn't have to win and he knows it.	O ne a sa lokela ho hlola mme o a e tseba.
I did not say where I was.	Ha kea bolela hore na ke hokae.
We’re talking about food, and we’re talking about food writing.	Re bua ka lijo, 'me re bua ka ho ngola lijo.
That's what he says.	Ke seo a se buang.
Suggest if you have it.	Fana ka maikutlo haeba u na le eona.
You used to be here, didn't you?	U kile ua ba mona, na ha ho joalo?
And shoes.	Le lieta.
In fact, he can play anything.	Ha e le hantle, a ka bapala ntho leha e le efe.
Unemployment.	Ho hloka mosebetsi.
I just started.	Ke sa tsoa qala.
I'll just leave that there.	Ke tla tlohela seo feela moo.
You did not return to me.	Ha ua ka ua khutlela ho 'na.
That will do.	Seo se tla etsa.
Every call.	Mohala o mong le o mong.
He retired early.	O ile a tlohela mosebetsi pele ho nako.
Thanks to everyone.	Re leboha batho bohle.
You really should know that.	Ruri o lokela ho tseba seo.
He had not received any food since his arrival.	O ne a e-s'o fumane lijo ho tloha ha a fihla.
Probably bad.	Mohlomong e mpe.
Now it doesn't.	Jwale ha e etse jwalo.
The dog usually wins.	Hangata ntja e hlola.
But still, they are there.	Empa leha ho le joalo, ba teng.
She likes to be in her room.	O rata ho ba ka kamoreng ea hae.
You must know.	O tlameha ho tseba.
That he would meet.	Hore o ne a tla kopana.
In fact, we found that this was not necessary.	Ha e le hantle, re fumane hore sena ha se hlokahale.
Talk to her first.	Bua le eena pele.
My husband doesn't even like me doing that.	Monna oa ka ha a rate le hore ke etse joalo.
And when it did, it was dangerous.	Mme ha e etsahala, e ne e le kotsi.
Like, the same reason.	Joalo ka, lebaka le tšoanang.
But to him this did not matter.	Empa ho eena sena se ne se sa tsotelle.
The book is working.	Buka e ea sebetsa.
It was not his place.	E ne e se sebaka sa hae.
But you did not have to wait to leave.	Empa u ne u sa hloke ho ema hore u tsamaee.
However, the second time was better.	Leha ho le joalo, lekhetlo la bobeli e ne e le betere.
You have to work too.	Le uena u tlameha ho sebetsa.
I had to find him.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho mo fumana.
They did not tell me.	Ha baa ka ba mpolella.
It was a high time!	E ne e le nako e phahameng!
I don't want to do that.	Ha ke batle ho etsa joalo.
She was beautiful tonight.	O ne a le motle bosiung bona.
And some food.	Le ho ja ho hong.
Maybe we can stay there.	Mohlomong re ka lula moo.
This was not his room.	Ena e ne e se kamore ea hae.
You can catch it from here to try it.	U ka e tšoara ho tloha mona ho e leka.
Again, what they are, and not what they are not.	Hape, seo ba leng sona, mme e seng seo ba seng sona.
They have no sense.	Ha li na kelello.
I was caught in the truth.	Ke ile ka tšoaroa ka 'nete.
We continued to be good friends.	Re ile ra tsoela pele ho ba metsoalle e molemo.
That is so today.	Kajeno ho joalo.
He should not have said anything.	O ne a sa lokela ho bua letho.
It hurts a lot.	Ho bohloko haholo.
And so it was before.	Mme ho bile jwalo pele.
You said you trusted him.	U itse ua mo tšepa.
I did all that.	Ke entse tseo tsohle.
He drank his coffee alone.	O ile a noa kofi ea hae a le mong.
We do not say that.	Ha re bue joalo.
You hear things.	U utloa lintho.
She has no child.	Ha a na ngoana.
Or maybe it's not his.	Kapa mohlomong ha se oa hae.
The road does not seem to be empty.	Tsela e bonahala e se na batho.
To really live, to eat.	Ho phela ehlile, ho ja.
I told her everything.	Ke mo boleletse tsohle.
There is nothing you can do right now.	Ha ho letho leo u ka le etsang ka hona joale.
Yes, you can find people who can do it.	E, u ka fumana batho ba ka e etsang.
Just don't go there.	Feela u se ke ua ea moo.
It's a weird place.	Ke sebaka se makatsang.
I had no idea what I was thinking.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke nahane eng.
Are you sure you know what you are doing?	Na u na le bonnete ba hore u tseba seo u se etsang?
He knows you are not what he wants you to be.	O a tseba hore ha o seo a se batlang.
Look at what happened.	Sheba se etsahetseng.
It was time to retire.	Ho ile ha fihla nako ea ho tlohela mosebetsi.
I was his psychologist.	Ke ne ke le setsebi sa hae sa kelello.
He still did not understand who she was now.	O ne a ntse a sa utloisise hore na ke mang hona joale.
I will be doing this every day.	Ke tla be ke etsa sena letsatsi le letsatsi.
Someone would have told you before me.	Motho a ka be a le boleletse pele ho nna.
I feel very important.	Ke ikutloa ke le oa bohlokoa haholo.
He said he would have to leave.	O ile a bolela hore o tla tlameha ho tsamaea.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha se seo.
Morning is best.	Hoseng ho molemo ka ho fetisisa.
You do not know us.	Ha o re tsebe.
I looked closely.	Ka sheba haufi.
Well, soon he would know.	Hantle, haufinyane o ne a tla tseba.
This can be fun for him.	Sena se ka ba monate ho eena.
But he thought it would be his.	Empa o ne a nahana hore e tla ba tsa hae.
He did not want to come here.	O ne a sa batle ho tla mona.
The fault lies with the individual.	Phoso e ho motho ka mong.
My life is not good.	Bophelo ba ka ha bo monate.
He just sat there and looked around.	A dula feela mme a sheba sebakeng.
He saw what happened.	O bone se etsahetseng.
You will never need anything else.	U ke ke ua hloka letho hape.
I could not speak.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho bua.
We had a family.	Re ne re e-na le lelapa.
Probably not.	Mohlomong o ne a sa tla.
This was the best thing ever.	Ena e ne e le ntho e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
It's really fun to see them.	Ho hlile ho monate ho bona.
He was only thirty years old.	O ne a le lilemo li mashome a mararo feela.
Maybe he loves you very much.	Mohlomong oa u rata haholo.
The girl obviously had a lot to learn.	Ho hlakile hore ngoanana eo o ne a e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
They are very beautiful.	Ba batle haholo.
However, consider what he says from now on.	Leha ho le joalo, nahana hore o re ho tloha joale ho ea pele.
Besides, it was more than that.	Ntle ho moo, ho ne ho feta moo.
Then, go back to the starting point.	Ebe, khutlela sebakeng sa ho qala.
We are not as close as my father and I were.	Ha re le haufi joalo ka 'na le ntate.
That is my picture.	Seo ke setšoantšo sa ka.
We are friends, of a certain kind.	Re metsoalle, ea mofuta o itseng.
No, it was not the only question in any way.	Che, e ne e se eona feela potso ka tsela leha e le efe.
He drinks alone.	O noa a le mong.
This, in my opinion, is not true.	Sena, ka maikutlo a ka, hase 'nete.
I did not ask him about it.	Ha kea ka ka mo botsa ka eona.
Not many people think that it is worth trying.	Ha se batho ba bangata ba nahanang hore ho bohlokoa ho leka.
Last year it came back for many years.	Selemong se fetileng se ile sa khutla ka lilemo tse ngata.
In the end, however, it works just like anything.	Qetellong, leha ho le joalo, e sebetsa joalo ka eng kapa eng.
Get it all together.	Etsa hore tsohle li kopane.
We'll start again tomorrow morning.	Re tla qala hape hosane hoseng.
That would be difficult.	Hoo ho ne ho tla ba thata.
Neither did they.	Le bona ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
You will not find him.	U ke ke ua mo fumana.
I have strong legs.	Ke na le maoto a matla.
Some ideas are very interesting here.	Maikutlo a mang a monate haholo mona.
That's what you are.	Ke seo u leng sona.
These look great, good work.	Tsena li shebahala li le ntle, mosebetsi o motle.
I'm sorry to see you go.	Ke masoabi ho u bona u tsamaea.
If he had not been present, she would not have had the impression of the family.	Haeba a ne a le sieo, e ka be e se na maikutlo a lelapa leo.
I have encountered a problem.	Ke kopane le bothata.
I realized that no one was talking to me anymore.	Ke ile ka hlokomela hore ha ho sa na motho ea buang le ’na.
This is not easy to achieve.	Sena ha se bonolo ho se fihlela.
He decided that he would not return.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore a ke ke a khutla.
Her boyfriend was drinking.	Mohlankana oa hae o ne a ntse a noa.
There it is again, yes.	Ke eo hape, e.
However, many will need more.	Leha ho le joalo, ba bangata ba tla hloka ho feta moo.
You no longer have to work.	Ha u sa tlameha ho sebetsa.
Thank you, but you do not have to be present.	Kea leboha, empa ha ho hlokahale hore u be teng.
I'll have to try it again.	Ke tla tlameha ho e leka hape.
Write your name here.	Ngola lebitso la hau mona.
Not just books.	E seng libuka feela.
But it was there too.	Empa e ne e le teng hape.
We want a man like that.	Re batla monna ea joalo.
He was always busy.	O ne a dula a phathahane.
I don't care about them.	ha ke tsotelle bona.
First, read these.	Pele, bala tsena.
I want to go.	Ke batla ho tsamaea.
This is exactly what we know.	Sena ke seo re se tsebang hantle.
They tried to fix it.	Ba ile ba leka ho e lokisa.
No, it's just getting out.	Che, ke ho tsoa feela.
This is a very simple procedure.	Ena ke mokhoa o bonolo haholo.
Don't say that.	O seke wa bolela seo.
So are you.	Le uena u joalo.
I was trying.	Ke ne ke leka.
It looks good.	E shebahala e le ntle.
He could not speak.	O ne a sitoa ho bua.
I was my husband.	Ke ne ke le monna oa ka.
That's all now.	Ke tsohle jwale.
And he refused to come.	Mme ya hana ho tla.
It decided to rectify the situation.	E ile ea etsa qeto ea ho lokisa boemo.
The past is too much for me.	Tse fetileng li ngata haholo ho 'na.
He agreed that the food was delicious.	O ile a lumela hore lijo tseo li monate.
Both are useless.	Ka bobeli ha li na thuso.
He tried not to dwell on it.	O ile a leka hore a se ke a lula a nahana ka seo.
That's the whole point.	Ke eona taba kaofela.
But we offered nothing.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra fana ka letho.
I stop trying.	Ke tlohela ho leka.
Hearing all of this is very helpful.	Ho utloa sena sohle ho thusa haholo.
It will not be so.	Ha ho sa tla ba joalo.
I have a lot of things.	Ke na le lintho tse ngata.
We live nearby.	Re lula haufi.
I decided to go back and sit down.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho khutla le ho lula fatše.
But it is useless.	Empa ha ho na thuso.
I like traveling a lot.	Ke rata ho tsamaea haholo.
From there on, things seemed to come together.	Ho tloha moo ho ea pele, lintho li bonahala li kopane.
I was just there.	Ke ne ke le teng feela.
However, you had enough to drink for breakfast.	Leha ho le joalo, u ne u e-na le ho noa ho lekaneng ka lijo tsa hoseng.
That he wished for her.	Hore o ne a mo lakatsa.
The process of doing this is clear.	Mokhoa oa ho etsa sena o hlakile.
It came to him that he was falling.	Ho ile ha tla ho eena hore o oa.
He did not understand.	O ne a sa utloisise.
I loved it.	Ke ne ke e rata.
I don't think they do.	Ke nahana hore ha ba etse joalo.
I had no idea you were coming.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na u tla tla.
Of course, there is nothing he needs to start over.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho letho leo a lokelang ho le qala.
Some may tell us all that.	Ba bang ba ka re bolella seo sohle.
And we have work to do.	Mme re na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa.
Many years of hard times.	Lilemo tse ngata tsa linako tse thata.
Now, you are right where you should be.	Hona joale, u hantle moo u lokelang ho ba teng.
He just looked back.	O ile a sheba morao feela.
I was glad he was so excited about it.	Ke ne ke thabetse hore o ne a thabile haholo ka eona.
In fact, he was the only player.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le sebapali a le mong.
I really feel strong.	Ka sebele ke ikutloa ke le matla.
This will help them to know what they know.	Sena se tla ba thusa ho tseba seo ba se tsebang.
This was very fun.	Sena se ne se le monate haholo.
Then he returns home.	Ebe o khutlela hae.
You say you made a mistake.	U re o entse phoso.
Thank you so much for making my day of delicious food.	Ke leboha haholo ho entse letsatsi la ka la ho ba le lijo tse monate.
Fear of what he might hear, or what he might hear.	Ho tšaba seo a ka 'nang a se utloa, kapa seo a ka 'nang a se utloa.
He was going to help find his father.	O ne a il'o thusa ho fumana ntate oa hae.
I can do this job for you.	Nka u etsetsa mosebetsi ona.
But there seemed to be something wrong with him.	Empa ho ne ho bonahala ho e-na le ho hong ho phoso ka eena.
He walked and walked.	O ile a tsamaea 'me a tsamaea.
Until then, there is nothing you can do.	Ho fihlela ka nako eo, ha ho letho leo u ka le etsang.
They know everything about that.	Ba tseba sohle ka seo.
Don't try to pay too much.	U se ke ua leka ho lefa chelete e ngata haholo.
She looked delicious.	O ne a bonahala a le monate.
It's hard to do everything.	Ho thata ho etsa tsohle.
He does not like to go.	Ha a rate ho tsamaea.
I can't overcome this.	Ha ke khone ho hlola sena.
It was not a mistake.	E ne e se phoso.
These are the things that are important to this group.	Tsena ke lintho tsa bohlokoa ho sehlopha sena.
He talks about everything.	O bua ka tsohle.
We can't say we will see that.	Re ke ke ra re re tla ke re bone seo.
However, my mother did not progress well at this time.	Leha ho le joalo, ’Mè ha aa ka a tsoela pele hantle nakong ena.
That's the letter, baby.	Ke eo lengolo, ngoana.
It's almost as bad as it starts this book.	E batla e le mpe joalo ka ha e qala buka ena.
None of this is true.	Ha ho le e ’ngoe ea lintho tsena eo e leng ’nete.
New every day.	Tse ncha letsatsi le letsatsi.
This is the way we want it.	Ena ke tsela eo re e batlang ka eona.
He asked where they were.	A botsa hore na ba hokae.
He finally found his way.	Qetellong o ile a fumana tsela ea hae.
You can tell me anything.	O ka mpolella eng kapa eng.
I don't have one of them.	Ha ke na e 'ngoe ea tsona.
Found error.	E fumane phoso.
Find us there.	Re batle teng.
They say nothing.	Ha ba bue letho.
He tried but did not know how to help us.	O ile a leka empa a sa tsebe hore na a ka re thusa joang.
Enter learning and playing for fun.	Kena ho ithuta le ho bapala bakeng sa monate.
I want nothing.	Ha ke batle letho .
In fact, he was very much afraid of her.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a mo tšaba haholo.
That's the reason.	Ke lona lebaka.
Do not try to eat.	U se ke ua leka ho ja.
You can tell by looking at him.	O ka tseba ka ho mo sheba feela.
They keep it beautiful.	Ba e boloka e le ntle.
However, you know.	Leha ho le joalo, oa tseba.
He was there, of course.	O ne a le teng, ehlile.
And you probably know his name.	'Me mohlomong u tseba lebitso la hae.
I have to write someone about it.	Ke lokela ho ngola motho ka eona.
I'm not sure anyone else can.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore ho na le motho e mong ea ka khonang.
There is nothing you can do.	Ha ho letho le le leng leo u ka le etsang.
We start small.	Re qala hanyane.
There will be no arrest.	Ha ho na ho mo tšoara.
However, he knew what to say.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a tseba seo a tla se bua.
I can't tell you.	Nke ke ka o bolella.
They go to school.	Ba kena sekolong.
Then I got the idea.	Eaba ke fumana mohopolo.
They started making breakfast.	Ba ile ba qala ho etsa lijo tsa hoseng.
I'm the only one who can talk to her about it.	Ke 'na feela eo a ka buang le eena ka taba ena.
That's what we do.	Ke ntho eo re e etsang.
His questions were clear.	Lipotso tsa hae li ne li hlakile.
He has a lot of money	O na le chelete e ngata
You have great friends.	U na le metsoalle e phahameng.
Of course this could be a better place.	Ehlile sena e ka ba sebaka se betere.
I mean he even thought about what he was thinking.	Ke bolela hore o bile o nahana seo a se nahanang.
I would have to ask my doctor about it.	Ke ne ke tla tlameha ho botsa ngaka ea ka ka eona.
But again, this is not the case for us.	Empa hape, ho joalo ha ho joalo ho rona.
I think so.	Ke nahana hore ho joalo.
Your friends were talking about it.	Metsoalle ea hau e ne e bua ka eona.
He does not seem to notice the passage of time.	Ha a bonahale a bona nako e ntse e tsoela pele.
Don't let them know anything about this.	Se ke oa lumella hore u tsebe letho ka sena.
Trying to fix things.	Ho leka ho lokisa lintho.
We had everything we needed and more.	Re ne re e-na le sohle seo re se hlokang le ho feta.
I want to say time is running out.	Ke batla ho re nako e ea pele.
I have not used it very much either.	Ha kea e sebelisa haholo le 'na.
It was the same with his mother.	Ho ne ho le joalo le ka 'mè oa hae.
We are human beings.	Re batho.
We don't have much time.	Ha re na nako e ngata.
He knew how to do it right.	O ne a tseba ho etsa seo hantle.
And they probably are.	'Me mohlomong ba joalo.
They will need him more than they think.	Ba tla mo hloka ho feta kamoo ba nahanang kateng.
It was good to say that it never happened.	Ho ne ho le molemo ho bolela hore ha ho mohla ho kileng ha etsahala.
There is nothing he can do.	Haho seo a ka se etsang.
There was no other way.	Ho ne ho se na mokhoa o mong.
You are more human than you know.	O motho ho feta kamoo o tsebang.
It could be one of your children.	E ka ba e mong oa bana ba hau.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore ho ne ho se joalo.
However, the truth is hard.	Leha ho le joalo, 'nete e thata.
They only have some.	Li na le tse ling feela.
I had to tell my kids.	Ke ne ke lokela ho bolella bana ba ka.
I see him coming back alone.	Ke bona a khutla a le mong.
There may be a way.	Ho ka ba le tsela.
None of them are new.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona e ncha.
The way he was, no one could love him.	Tsela eo a neng a le ka eona, ho ne ho se motho ea neng a ka mo rata.
We did it together.	Re e entse hammoho.
But he probably does.	Empa mohlomong o etsa joalo.
He doesn't have time to see them.	Ha a na nako ea ho ba bona.
But maybe it was.	Empa mohlomong ho ne ho le jwalo.
I ask each one of you.	Ke botsa e mong le e mong wa lona.
Her parents left last year.	Batsoali ba hae ba ile ba tsamaea selemong se fetileng.
Thank you so much for meeting him.	Ke leboha haholo hore ebe ke kopane le eena.
I was doing it a lot, but little by little.	Ke ne ke ntse ke e etsa haholo, empa hanyane le hanyane.
We will decide what happens there.	Re tla etsa qeto ea se etsahalang moo.
You will love my mother, everyone does.	O tla rata mme wa ka, bohle ba etsa jwalo.
I would like to say thank you.	Ke rata ho re kea leboha.
There will be no start.	Ha ho na ho qala.
Walking can take a week.	Ho tsamaea ka maoto, ho ka nka beke.
She was beautiful.	O ne a le motle.
Because it never asked them.	Hobane ha e eso ka e ba botsa.
I will continue to save.	Ke tla tsoela pele ho boloka.
No one has ever spoken or spoken like that about him.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a bua kapa a bua joalo ka eena.
He asked what the fault was.	O ile a botsa hore na molato ke eng.
They were skeptical, but they did not know.	Ba ne ba belaela, empa ba ne ba sa tsebe.
He was a man of the house now.	E ne e le monna wa ntlo jwale.
I asked for help.	Ke ile ka kopa thuso.
I just wanted to be sure.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho ba le bonnete.
I'm glad to see more.	Ke thabela ho bona tse ling.
I knew what this meant.	Ke ne ke tseba hore na sena se bolela eng.
I really have it.	Ke hlile ke na le eona.
Anyone who wants it.	Mang kapa mang ea e batlang.
I really think this is the only way.	Ke hlile ke nahana hore ena ke eona feela tsela.
Your style is good.	Mokhoa oa hau o motle.
Sometimes it takes a long time.	Ka linako tse ling ho nka nako e telele.
Some felt that way.	Ba bang ba ne ba ikutloa joalo.
It was as he had hoped, at the time.	E ne e le kamoo a neng a lebeletse kateng, ka nako eo.
Or rather, no.	Kapa ho e-na le hoo, che.
They don't want to play.	Ha ba batle ho bapala.
It will pass.	E tla feta.
He works for both of us.	O sebetsa bakeng sa rona ka bobeli.
What did you say?	U itseng?
No need.	Ha ho hlokahale.
It's something to you.	Ke ntho ho wena.
They all agreed now.	Bohle ba ile ba lumela joale.
We did not speak.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bua.
It takes time for him to stay.	Ho nka nako hore a lule a le teng.
It was morning now.	E ne e le hoseng joale.
There was always a better life somewhere.	Ho ne ho lula ho e-na le bophelo bo betere sebakeng se seng.
I would like to know what happened in the past.	Ke kopa ho tseba se etsahetseng nakong e fetileng.
It's not just me.	Ha se 'na feela.
Help! 	Thusa!
He can be with you at this time.	A ka ba teng le uena nakong ena.
Help! 	Thusa!
Or if you take them literally.	Kapa haeba u li nka ka tsela ea sebele.
It is very important.	E bohlokoa haholo.
I thought about this.	Ke ile ka nahana ka sena.
He can't eat well.	Ha a khone ho ja hantle.
It is difficult to say unless you are present.	Ho thata ho bolela ntle le haeba o le teng.
I wrote.	Ke ile ka ngola.
They want money.	Ba batla chelete.
I have never been a resident.	Ha ke eso be motho wa ho dula.
Be the first to donate it !.	Eba oa pele oa ho fana ka eona!.
He arrived home late.	O ile a fihla hae ka mor’a nako.
He knew she was looking for him too.	O ne a tseba hore le eena oa mo batla.
I told her she shouldn't do anything.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore ha aa lokela ho etsa letho.
Some you may find easier than others.	Tse ling u ka li fumana li le bonolo ho feta tse ling.
I have not tried anything.	Ha kea leka letho.
I will help her.	Ke tlo mo thusa.
She was always beautiful with children.	O ne a lula a le motle ka bana.
In fact, it is very simple.	Ha e le hantle, e bonolo haholo.
He could see that something was wrong.	O ne a bona hore ho na le phoso.
The man's life was in danger.	Ho ne ho ka etsahala hore ebe bophelo ba monna eo bo ne bo le kotsing.
If you want to pick it up quickly, we will leave soon.	Haeba u batla ho e nka kapele, re tla tsamaea kapele.
When we need.	Ha re hloka.
I like living here.	Ke rata ho dula mona.
They may never do things their own way.	E ka ’na eaba ha ho mohla ba etsang lintho ka maikutlo a bona a sebele.
He said he wanted to buy it.	A re o batla ho e reka.
Too bad error.	Phoso e mpe haholo.
But you have it.	Empa u na le eona.
Day two was no better.	Letsatsi la bobeli le ne le se betere.
You can help us with this work.	U ka khona ho re thusa ka mosebetsi ona.
Like everyone else, he just wanted to go home.	Joaloka motho e mong le e mong, o ne a batla ho khutlela hae feela.
I had to think quickly about what to do.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho nahana kapele hore na ke etse eng.
That you.	Hore u .
I went back every day.	Ke ne ke khutlela morao letsatsi le leng le le leng.
It seems I can't stay in time and space.	Ho bonahala eka ha ke khone ho lula ka nako le sebaka.
But, you have to work very well.	Empa, o tlameha ho sebetsa hantle haholo.
It just doesn’t make sense.	Ha e na maikutlo feela.
I just have to keep going.	Ke tlameha feela ho tsoela pele.
Of course it was not.	Ehlile ho ne ho se jwalo.
The fourth is the best.	Ea bone ke eona e molemo ka ho fetisisa.
However, I do not care.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsotelle.
They saw something wrong.	Ba ne ba bone ntho e mpe.
We do this every day.	Re etsa sena letsatsi le letsatsi.
He is my husband now.	Ke monna oa ka hona joale.
No, it did not work so well.	Che, ha ea sebetsa hantle hakaalo.
However, what he did was obvious.	Leha ho le joalo, seo a se entseng se ne se hlakile.
You do not know exactly what they will be like.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na ba tla ba joang.
I'll tell you.	Ke tla o bolella.
It's simple, and it works.	E bonolo, 'me e ntse e sebetsa.
Everything is clearer to you than others.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e hlakile ho uena ho feta ba bang.
Think of all that you have.	Nahana ka tsohle tseo u nang le tsona.
The style of things.	Mokhoa oa lintho.
He did not know what to do next.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng hape.
Yes, they are.	E, ke bana.
He does not seem to be able to drive.	Ho bonahala eka ha a khone ho khanna.
Now the area is much larger than before.	Hona joale sebaka se se se le ngata ho feta pele.
I called my mother.	Ke ile ka letsetsa 'Mè.
This is a great idea.	Ena ke mohopolo o moholo.
And no one does anything about it.	'Me ha ho motho ea etsang letho ka eona.
Nobody is coming.	Haho motho ya tlang.
I like to have it for me.	Ke rata ho ba le eona ho nna.
It passes from the past.	E feta ho tloha nakong e fetileng.
Then he started.	Eaba o qala.
Obviously something is happening.	Ho hlakile hore ho na le ntho e etsahalang.
She cried softly	A lla ka bonolo
But you loved him.	Empa u ne u mo rata.
Think about that even if you do not see us as a family.	Nahana ka seo le ha o sa re bone re le lelapa.
This happened only occasionally.	Sena se ile sa etsahala ka linako tse ling feela.
Life was like that.	Bophelo bo ne bo le joalo.
You know, that's just a good thing.	Ua tseba, e leng ntho e ntle feela.
You need to learn both.	U lokela ho ithuta ka bobeli.
There were no other problems.	Ho ne ho se na mathata a mang.
They love you if you love them.	Ba u rata haeba u ba rata.
We decided not to go.	Re entse qeto ea ho se tsamaee.
In this he must give all his opinions.	Ho sena o tlameha ho fana ka maikutlo a hae kaofela.
They never looked so good.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba bonahala ba le ntle haholo.
I looked in another room there, and he said you would be here.	Ke ile ka sheba ka phaposing e 'ngoe moo, 'me a re u tla ba teng mona.
The only way out is to pass.	Tsela feela ea ho tsoa ke ho feta.
Sometimes, it is.	Ka linako tse ling, ho joalo.
That is already happening.	Seo se se se ntse se etsahala.
He said he was sure.	O itse o na le bonnete.
Or how to get out of it.	Kapa mokhoa oa ho tsoa ho eona.
More than anything he wanted to go.	Ho feta eng kapa eng eo a neng a batla hore a tsamaee.
They don't seem to care.	Ho bonahala ba sa tsotelle.
This will work.	Sena se tla sebetsa.
They looked at him suspiciously.	Ba ile ba mo sheba ka ho belaela.
There is nothing.	Ha ho letho le le leng.
It doesn't get any better.	Ha e be betere ho feta moo.
They went on.	Ba ile ba tsoela pele.
No, it is not necessary, no.	Che, ha ho hlokahale, che.
It’s fun, but there will be a lot.	Ho monate, empa ho tla ba ngata.
I was the kind of man here.	Ke ne ke le mofuta oa monna ea mona.
He didn't know what it was.	O ne a sa tsebe ke eng.
There you are.	Eo moo.
He cared for her.	O ne a mo hlokomela.
There was no one else.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong.
If you have any questions, ask.	Haeba u na le lipotso, botsa.
No one ever asked for it.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a li kōpa.
No, not at all.	Che, ha ho joalo haholo.
It just so happened.	Ho ile ha etsahala hore ho be joalo.
Everyone has heard it.	Bohle ba e utloile.
I find them very useful !.	Ke li fumana li le molemo haholo!.
I'm the only one here.	Ke 'na feela mona.
They had worked together before.	Ba ne ba kile ba sebetsa hammoho.
However, he never did.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo.
Yes, it was painful.	E, ho ne ho le bohloko.
I could not open it.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho e bula.
I took one for the group.	Ke nkile e 'ngoe bakeng sa sehlopha.
He suggested that you know for sure that this was going to happen.	O entse tlhahiso ea hore u tsebe hantle hore sena se tla etsahala.
He is coming home.	O tla hae.
I do not want to comment on anything.	Ha ke batle ho fana ka maikutlo a letho.
Although everything is new.	Leha e le hore ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ncha.
Ask if he will see you.	Botsa hore na o tla u bona.
I was not one of these people.	Ke ne ke se e mong oa batho bana.
Have you ever read that book?	Na u kile ua bala buka eo?
I can't stand tonight.	Ha ke khone ho ema bosiung bona.
John, thank you.	John, kea leboha.
We do not need to go further.	Ha re hloke ho feta.
But you really have to ask questions to find out.	Empa u hlile u tlameha ho botsa lipotso ho fumana.
It was time to decide.	E ne e le nako ea ho etsa qeto.
It must be a driving force.	E tlameha ebe ke mokhoa oa ho khanna.
It didn't have to be fun.	E ne e sa tlameha ho ba monate.
And we're eating it tonight.	Mme re ntse re e ja bosiung bona.
But that's a good thing.	Empa ke ntho e ntle.
I'm not as hard as they say they are.	Ha ke thata joalo ka ha ba bolela.
Look, you can't think of everything.	Sheba, u ke ke ua nahana ka tsohle.
Which is good for me.	E leng hantle ka nna.
There is no place for him here.	Haho sebaka sa hae mona.
He had nothing.	O ne a sena letho.
His hands let go of his head.	Matsoho a hae a tlohela hlooho.
My life is good.	Bophelo ba ka bo monate.
But he was not so sure.	Empa o ne a se na bonnete hakaalo.
But he is in a good place.	Empa o sebakeng se setle.
They seem afraid of him.	Ba bonahala ba mo tšaba.
I had a good thing.	Ke bile le ntho e ntle.
It did not work.	Ha e ea sebetsa.
We'll have to let him stand alone a little more.	Re tla tlameha ho mo tlohela ho ema a le mong ho feta hanyane.
They were on time and very active.	Ba ne ba le ka nako 'me ba sebetsa haholo.
We can see how that goes.	Re ka bona hore na seo se tsamaea joang.
So just stay close to me.	Kahoo lula feela haufi le 'na.
He knew where to turn.	O ne a tseba moo a ka e batlang teng.
I had to know in advance.	Ke ne ke lokela ho tseba esale pele.
The idea is very simple.	Mohopolo o bonolo haholo.
I could hear what my mother was feeling.	Ke ne ke utloa seo ’Mè a neng a se utloa.
If you do, you will know.	Ha u etsa joalo u tla tseba.
I looked like a child.	Ke ne ke shebahala joaloka ngoana.
Not necessarily in the same place.	Hase hakaalo sebakeng se le seng.
However, I cannot do it alone.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke khone ho e etsa ke le mong.
It found it difficult, but it managed to do it.	E ile ea fumana ho le thata, empa e ne e khona ho e etsa.
That was the first thing we tried.	Ke ntho ea pele eo re ileng ra e leka.
I would have done well to think so.	Nka be ke ile ka etsa hantle hore ke nahane joalo.
He is stronger than you think.	O matla ho feta kamoo o nahanang.
He kept it together and somehow survived.	O ile a e boloka hammoho 'me ka tsela e itseng a phela.
I did not find anything.	Ha kea ka ka fumana letho.
I wanted to make him sad.	Ke ne ke batla ho mo etsa masoabi.
It was too late to do anything at that time.	E ne e se e le morao haholo ho etsa letho ka nako eo.
That also applies.	Seo le sona sea sebetsa.
They never do that.	Ha ho mohla ba etsang joalo.
I often wonder what others think of us.	Hangata kea ipotsa hore na ba bang ba nahana eng ka rona.
That is good news and bad news.	Ke litaba tse monate le tse mpe tseo.
It does not exist.	Ha e eo.
I mean we are.	Ke bolela hore re joalo.
Except sometimes when he has.	Ntle le ka linako tse ling ha a na le.
Your hair looks beautiful.	Moriri oa hau o shebahala o le motle.
He knows something.	O tseba ho hong.
Yet he will tell me.	Leha ho le joalo o tla mpolella.
Moreover, food and coffee are very tasty.	Ho feta moo, lijo le kofi li monate haholo.
It is not breakfast.	Ha se lijo tsa hoseng.
I think they did it their way.	Ke nahana hore ba entse joalo ka tsela ea bona.
There was power in this area.	Ho ne ho e-na le matla sebakeng sena.
You will be here with us.	U tla ba mona le rona.
But still it was a very important time for me.	Empa leha ho le joalo e ne e le nako ea bohlokoa haholo ho ’na.
The boy was crying.	Moshanyana eo o ne a lla.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke tsebe hantle joalo.
You may even feel worse before you feel better.	U ka 'na ua utloa bohloko le ho feta pele u ikutloa u le betere.
Another went.	E 'ngoe hape e ile.
It is not easy to.	Ha ho bonolo ho .
But we seem to be going through it all.	Empa ho bonahala re ntse re feta ho eona kaofela.
He had never thought of that.	O ne a eso nahane ka seo.
But how? 	Empa joang?
The expert knows everything.	Setsebi se tseba tsohle.
Guilt of presence.	Molato oa ho ba teng.
Once, you will use it you can see it for yourself.	Hang, u tla e sebelisa u ka e bona u le mong.
I will not be.	nke ke ka ba teng.
If that sounds like fun, try it.	Haeba ho bonahala eka ke monate, leka.
It says something about the Father, too.	E bua ho hong ka Ntate, hape.
It's as simple as making friends.	Ho bonolo joalo ka ho etsa metsoalle.
And they will probably do so.	'Me mohlomong ba tla etsa joalo.
Your image will get mine.	Setšoantšo sa hau se tla fumana sa ka.
However, it does nothing.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e etse letho.
I wanted to be his.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba oa hae.
I am the mother first as they say.	Ke mme pele joalo ka ha ba bolela.
You can be with him in the end.	U ka ba le eena qetellong.
And he is doing that.	Mme a ntse a etsa seo.
We did both.	Re ile ra etsa ka bobeli.
I will try another.	Ke tla leka e 'ngoe.
We are hurt.	Re utloile bohloko.
Problems have arisen over the years.	Mathata a bile teng ka lilemo tse ngata.
That's the problem.	Ke bothata.
It would seem so.	Ho ka bonahala ho le joalo.
But it would not be so easy.	Empa ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo hakaalo.
What do you think of this book?	U nahana'ng ka buka ee?
The trend continued.	Mokhoa ona o ile oa tsoela pele.
However, no one wanted to know.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho ea neng a batla ho tseba.
It hurts them.	Ho bohloko ho bona.
You will sleep here alone.	U tla robala mona u le feela.
He tells me everything.	O mpolella tsohle.
I know too.	Kea tseba hape.
We would stay here again.	Re ne re tla lula mona hape.
They want the opportunity.	Ba batla monyetla.
She was already crying, thank you very much.	O ne a se a ntse a lla, ke leboha haholo.
I think that was a mistake.	Ke nahana hore hoo e ne e le phoso.
It usually stays alone.	Hangata e lula e le mong.
And le.	Mme le.
So, I work every day.	Ka hona, ke sebetsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
He thought it was better.	O ne a nahana hore ho molemo.
Many people drove to work.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba khanna ho ea mosebetsing.
I'm not talking to anyone.	Ha ke bue le motho.
One job is no better than another.	Mosebetsi o mong ha o molemo ho feta o mong.
Obviously this is not a problem.	Ho hlakile hore sena ha se bothata.
Those who know what's going on and can tell me.	Ba tsebang se etsahalang mme ba ka mpolella.
See what we can do.	Bona seo re ka se etsang.
More, and more, and more.	Ho feta, le hape, le hape.
Some reject it.	Ba bang baa e hana.
Some say well.	Ba bang ba re hantle.
I like that car.	Ke rata koloi eo.
Things went well soon after.	Lintho li ile tsa tsamaea kapele ka mor'a moo.
This is a very important book.	Ena ke buka ea bohlokoa haholo.
The phone was not one of those things.	Mohala e ne e se 'ngoe ea lintho tseo.
And that doesn't seem at all.	Mme seo ha se bonahale ho hang.
I will not speak.	Nke ke ka bua.
Meet them if you wish.	Kopana le bona ha o lakatsa.
It fits well.	E lekana hantle.
And another, if necessary.	Le e 'ngoe, haeba ho hlokahala.
I really would like to thank you.	Ruri nka leboha.
The good thing is what happened next.	Ntho e ntle ke se ileng sa etsahala ka mor'a moo.
So it is not very useful.	Kahoo ha e na thuso haholo.
You pick up your belongings and walk away.	U nka lintho tsa hau 'me u tsamaee.
It does not understand what is wrong.	Ha e utloisise hore na phoso ke efe.
Whether in the room, or outside it.	Leha e le ka phaposing, kapa ka ntle ho eona.
Or, moreover, to do a good job of doing it.	Kapa, ​​​​ho feta moo, ho etsa mosebetsi o motle oa ho e etsa.
This was true.	Sena e ne e le 'nete.
Where did he go?	O ile kae?
Their children were the first ones.	Bana ba bona e ne e le bona ba tlang pele.
I just needed you to know.	Ke ne ke hloka feela hore o tsebe.
Everyone loved him.	Bohle ba ne ba mo rata.
I knew exactly what he meant.	Ke ne ke tseba hantle seo a neng a se bolela.
However, it works now.	Leha ho le joalo, e sebetsa hona joale.
I found the same thing.	Ke fumane taba eona eo.
Second, you can.	Ea bobeli, u ka khona.
There is something you need to know.	Ho na le ntho eo o lokelang ho e tseba.
And children.	Le bana.
Thus, they would present the good news.	Kahoo, ba ne ba tla fana ka litaba tse molemo.
I wonder if he has ever been here.	Kea ipotsa hore na ebe o kile a fihla mona.
There was nothing they could do here.	Ho ne ho se letho leo ba ka le etsang mona.
It's easy.	Ho bonolo.
There have been some people here recently.	Ho bile le batho ba bang mona haufinyane.
I thought it was something like that.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke ntho e kang eo.
Some good stuff.	Lintho tse ling tse ntle.
There she is now.	Ke eo jwale.
He was eventually arrested.	Qetellong o ile a tšoaroa.
So I tried that.	Kahoo ke ile ka leka seo.
Family dinners can be very plentiful.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea tsa lelapa li ka ba tse ngata haholo.
Thank you so much for taking such good care of her.	Ke leboha haholo ka ho mo hlokomela hantle hakana.
We will never forget you.	Re ke ke ra lebala ka uena.
And they are always there for others.	'Me ba lula ba le teng bakeng sa ba bang.
Trying to find a way out.	Ho leka ho fumana tsela ea ho tsoa.
The same is true here.	Ho joalo le mona.
Now, you might think we're done.	Jwale, o ka nahana hore re qetile.
And that is the last place you can think of.	Mme ke sebaka sa ho qetela seo o ka nahanang ka sona.
However, do not think that it is bad.	Leha ho le joalo, u se ke ua nahana hore e mpe.
You fear for your life, but you are not alone.	U tšaba bophelo ba hau, empa ha se uena feela.
Only this, you never meet that guy again.	Feela sena, ha u sa kopana le mohlankana eo hape.
We traveled alone.	Re ile ra tsamaea re le bang.
And he probably did.	'Me mohlomong o ile a etsa joalo.
This is his worst mistake.	Ena ke phoso ea hae e bohloko.
I would do it.	ke ne ke tla e etsa.
Eventually he goes to it.	Qetellong o ea ho eona.
You can't have both.	U ka se be le eona ka bobeli.
She refused to start crying.	O ile a hana ho qala ho lla.
Nothing of the sort happened.	Ha ho letho la mofuta oo le ileng la etsahala.
That's the way he did.	Ke kamoo a entseng kateng.
It was not fun.	Ho ne ho se monate.
They will always be there.	Ba tla dula ba le teng.
Are you going to swim?	A na u il'o sesa?
They look that way.	Ba shebahala ka tsela eo.
He used solar energy.	O ile a sebelisa matla a letsatsi.
There was no other chance.	Ho ne ho se monyetla o mong.
You have to do this every day.	U tlameha ho etsa sena letsatsi le letsatsi.
He looked at his hands.	A sheba matsoho a hae.
Instead it was a way of eating.	Ho e-na le hoo e ne e le mokhoa oa ho ja.
So we can't say it's nothing.	Kahoo re ke ke ra re ha se letho.
I continued as usual.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele joaloka kamehla.
Start with what they know.	Qala ka seo ba se tsebang.
You probably heard about it.	Mohlomong u utloile ka eona.
The girl is arrested.	Ngoanana oa tšoaroa.
They got it well enough.	Ba e fumane hantle ho lekana.
And you are never wrong.	'Me ha ho mohla u phoso.
Which was.	E neng e le.
But so it is with you.	Empa ho joalo le ka tsa hau.
The picture was so beautiful.	Setšoantšo se ne se le setle haholo.
So did your father.	Kahoo ntate oa hao o entse joalo.
However there is no problem with that.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho na bothata ka seo.
He had never known this kind of pain.	Ho ne ho se mohla a kileng a tseba bohloko ba mofuta ona.
It will take a long time to write.	Ho tla nka nako e telele ho ngola.
And there it is again.	Mme ke eo hape.
There were no police.	Ho ne ho se na mapolesa.
For your location.	Ea sebaka sa hau.
Someone was waiting for him.	Motho o ne a mo emetse.
But it is very important.	Empa e bohlokoa haholo.
I didn't see many.	Ke ne ke sa bone tse ngata.
No, everything they did they did.	Che, ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo ba e entseng ba e entse.
Think of the children!	Nahana ka bana!
The best way is to use a team.	Mokhoa o motle ke ho sebelisa sehlopha.
He thinks there is something wrong.	O nahana hore ho na le phoso.
We wondered what they were doing.	Re ile ra ipotsa hore na ba etsa’ng.
Something was always there.	Ntho e ne e le teng kamehla.
I was afraid to do anything.	Ke ne ke tšaba ho etsa letho.
It will be back tomorrow.	E tla khutla hosane.
They just look.	Ba sheba feela.
He did not stop or look at anything.	Ha a ka a ema kapa hona ho sheba letho.
They all worked together as a team.	Kaofela ba ile ba sebetsa hammoho e le sehlopha.
It would be a doctor, a good job.	E ne e tla ba ngaka, mosebetsi o motle.
I love being at home.	Ke rata ho ba hae.
There were these people talking.	Ho ne ho e-na le batho bana ba buang.
Now he doesn't want to play at all.	Hona joale ha a sa batla ho bapala ho hang.
He has done a great job and is a true professional.	O entse mosebetsi o motle mme ke setsebi sa 'nete.
But to him it was like age.	Empa ho eena e ne eka ke lilemo.
If they ever were.	Haeba ba kile ba ba teng.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha ho joalo.
Just being.	Ho ba feela.
I just make them happy.	Ke ba etsetsa monate feela.
Yes, it was about staying, he told me.	E, e ne e le tsa ho lula, o ile a mpolella.
We will never take another one for the team.	Ha re sa tla nka e 'ngoe bakeng sa sehlopha.
This is very helpful when you are working with them.	Sena se thusa haholo ha o sebetsa le bona.
May you live longer!	E se eka u ka phela nako e telele!
Yet problems remain.	Leha ho le joalo mathata a ntse a le teng.
I could not live without it.	Ke ne nke ke ka phela ntle le eona.
If she did not have a child, she would have had one.	Hoja a ne a se na ngoana, a ka be a bile le eena.
The group cannot.	Sehlopha ha se khone.
And that is exactly what they did.	Mme ke sona seo ba ileng ba se etsa.
I’m working on the same thing right now.	Ke ntse ke sebetsa ka ntho e tšoanang hona joale.
Yours must be a problem.	Ya hao e tlameha ebe ke bothata.
Nothing in my life was going to be easy and fun.	Ha ho letho ka bophelo ba ka le neng le lokela ho ba bonolo le le monate.
She was beautiful now.	O ne a le motle jwale.
I do not know now.	Ha ke tsebe hona joale.
The dog did not come.	Ntja ha ea ka ea tla.
I really hope to.	Ke tšepa haholo ho.
He slept well for us.	O ile a re robala hantle.
It is difficult to know.	Ho thata ho tseba.
I have never seen that accident happen.	Ha ke eso bone kotsi eo e etsahala.
But you do not know, until you know it.	Empa ha o tsebe, ho fihlela o tseba.
He was not the only one who made a mistake here.	E ne e se eena feela ea neng a entse phoso mona.
And indeed they are.	'Me ehlile ba joalo.
And he did not need to know.	Hape o ne a sa hloke ho tseba.
But, again, it probably isn't.	Empa, hape, mohlomong ha ho joalo.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
Somehow it seemed unimportant.	Ka tsela e itseng ho ne ho bonahala ho se bohlokoa.
It wasn't really a house.	E ne e hlile e se ntlo.
But it is still going on.	Empa e ntse e tsoela pele.
None of us had it.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a e-na le eona.
I started to feel bad.	Ke ile ka qala ho utloa bohloko.
If not, who knows.	Haeba ho se joalo, ke mang ea tsebang.
Then it was a good thing.	Joale e ne e le taba e ntle.
Just exactly how he could see that night.	Hantle feela kamoo a neng a bona hantle bosiung boo.
And this book is definitely interesting.	Mme ka sebele buka ena e monate.
We can make a lot of money by working hard.	Re ka fumana chelete e ngata ha re sebetsa ka thata.
Of course, this is an idea.	Ha e le hantle, sena ke maikutlo.
We had such a wonderful time.	Re bile le nako e monate hakana.
We did not tell them about their son's past life.	Ha rea ​​ka ra ba bolella ka bophelo bo fetileng ba mora oa bona.
I think those are the best things.	Ke nahana hore tseo ke lintho tse ntle ka ho fetisisa.
It is his job.	Ke mosebetsi oa hae.
We will work harder to fix this issue.	Re tla sebetsa ka thata ho feta ho lokisa taba ena.
Each of us could do that.	E mong le e mong wa rona o ne a ka etsa jwalo.
But he had never told anyone why.	Empa o ne a eso bolelle motho lebaka.
So we all needed it.	Kahoo re ne re hloka bohle.
It did not.	Ha hoa ka ha ba joalo.
We just didn't want any of our own.	Re ne re mpa re sa batle leha e le efe ea rōna.
Talking about the past was difficult.	Ho bua ka lintho tse fetileng ho ne ho le thata.
She wondered how she was doing.	O ne a ipotsa hore na o ntse a le joang.
The same is true with money.	Ho joalo le ka chelete.
Some doubt that they can.	Ba bang ba belaela hore na ba ke ke ba khona.
He had done all he could.	O ne a entse sohle seo a neng a ka se etsa.
It was his whole life.	E ne e le oa hae bophelo bohle.
Who is more.	Ke mang le ho feta.
This is not a children's job, he did not tell anyone.	Sena ha se mosebetsi oa bana, ha aa ka a re ho motho.
However, it was nothing.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se letho.
He said others had to watch his weight.	A re ba bang ba ne ba lokela ho shebella boima ba hae.
He looks just like you.	O shebahala joalo ka uena.
Just what can happen.	Feela se ka etsahalang.
People will no longer take it.	Batho ha ba sa tla hlola ba e nka.
They refused to enter.	Ba ile ba hana ho kena.
And he says how it is.	'Me o bolela kamoo ho leng kateng.
In time, they may well come to that conclusion.	Ha nako e ntse e ea, ba ka ’na ba fihlela qeto eo.
He was almost wet.	O ne a batla a le metsi.
It would happen.	E ne e tla etsahala.
Another important thing you want is.	Ntho e 'ngoe ea bohlokoa eo u e batlang ke.
Occurs weekly.	E etsahalang beke le beke.
I'm used to it.	Ke e tloaetse.
They wanted to feel better after eating.	Ba ne ba batla ho ikutloa ba le betere ka mor'a ho e ja.
But we do not.	Empa ha re etse joalo.
I know this works.	Kea tseba hore sena se sebetsa.
But that is not the case.	Empa tseo ha li joalo.
Too many do not do that.	Ba bangata haholo ha ba etse joalo.
I have never seen this in simple maintenance work.	Ha ke so bone sena mosebetsing o bonolo oa ho boloka.
Living close to your family.	Ho lula haufi le lelapa la hau.
We can talk about this all night if you want.	Re ka bua ka taba ena bosiu bohle haeba u batla.
He was smart enough not to go.	O ne a na le kelello e lekaneng hore a se ke a ea.
The man helped her to her feet.	Monna eo a mo thusa ho ema ka maoto.
There is something here for everyone.	Ho na le ho hong mona bakeng sa motho e mong le e mong.
I will make sure you attend.	Ke tla etsa bonnete ba hore oa ba teng.
I looked at the dog.	Ke ile ka sheba ntja.
Or buy us.	Kapa ho re reka.
It can work.	E ka sebetsa.
We go from work to home.	Re tloha mosebetsing ho ea hae.
I enjoy their work.	Ke thabela mosebetsi oa bona.
Not many people know how powerful he is.	Hase batho ba bangata ba tsebang hore na o matla hakae.
He says what he knows.	O bolela seo a se tsebang.
It's so nice to be back here.	Ho monate haholo ho khutlela mona.
The question is.	Potso ke hore na.
It was his job.	E ne e le mosebetsi wa hae.
The doctor said he might not live that night.	Ngaka e itse e ka ’na ea se ke ea phela bosiung boo.
I'll tell you what we do here.	Ke tla u bolella seo re se etsang mona.
That has been going on for a long time now.	Seo esale se tsoela pele ka nako e telele joale.
This will take a very long time.	Sena se tla nka nako e telele haholo.
Don't eat that!	Se je seo!
Get in and out before they know what's going on.	Ho kena le ho tsoa pele ba tseba se etsahalang.
We spend a lot of time.	Re qeta nako e ngata.
I'm in pain.	Ke utloa bohloko.
And you probably would not want it.	'Me mohlomong u ne u ke ke ua e batla.
This is not my case.	Sena ha se taba ea ka.
It was not what he wanted to be.	E ne e se seo a neng a batla ho ba sona.
I know what he would do.	Ke tseba seo a neng a tla se etsa.
It was fun, as always.	E ne e le monate, joalo ka kamehla.
It was not a request.	E ne e se kopo.
You have to stay.	O tlameha ho dula.
Who is speaking?	Ke mang ea buang?
It's enough space.	Ke sebaka se lekaneng.
We are a family.	Re lelapa.
It does not exist.	Ha e eo.
However, he asked her to leave.	Leha ho le joalo o ile a mo kōpa hore a tsamaee.
And it will be.	Mme ho tla ba jwalo.
Don't make me do it.	O seke oa etsa hore ke e etse.
They only feel bad.	Ba utloa feela tse mpe.
I'm not sure how to take him.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka mo nka joang.
Also, it probably had to be tough.	Hape, mohlomong e ne e lokela ho ba thata.
This gives him a sense of learning.	Sena se etsa hore a be le maikutlo a ho ithuta.
He really saw her as a man.	O ne a hlile a mo bona e le monna.
Do not tell anyone that you are leaving.	U se ke ua bolella motho hore ua tsamaea.
Nice place.	Sebaka se setle.
He did not agree.	Ha aa ka a lumela.
This is a great opportunity.	Ona ke monyetla o moholo.
He did not say much.	Ha a ka a bua haholo.
No problem, of course.	Ha ho bothata, ehlile.
Do something else.	Etsa se seng.
That would not happen at all.	Seo se ne se ke ke sa etsahala ho hang.
Yet I loved him.	Leha ho le joalo ke ne ke mo rata.
Then it did not.	Joale ha ea ka ea etsa joalo.
But there was one man he was looking for.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le monna a le mong feela eo a kileng a mo batla.
But we did not.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
I want it to be visible.	Ke batla hore e bonahale.
It was a very interesting reading.	E ne e le ho bala ho monate haholo.
As soon as you get home.	Hang feela ha u fihla hae.
How was your day today?	Letsatsi la hau le ne le le joang kajeno?
I have nothing for you.	Ha ke na letho bakeng sa hau.
We would do it every day.	Re ne re tla e etsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
It doesn't seem like they can do it.	Ha ho bonahale eka ba ka e etsa.
It's a beautiful place.	Ke sebaka se setle.
I'm not the only one who thinks so.	Ha se 'na feela ea nahanang joalo.
No one needs to see it now.	Ha ho hlokahale hore mang kapa mang a e bone hona joale.
It is wonderful to be grateful for a job well done.	Ho monate ha motho a leboha mosebetsi o motle.
However, her husband did the same.	Leha ho le joalo, monna oa hae o ile a etsa joalo.
We never talked about my real parents.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra bua ka batsoali ba ka ba sebele.
I have an important point I want to tell you.	Ke na le taba ea bohlokoa eo ke batlang ho u bolella eona.
So you have to be realistic about that.	Kahoo u lokela ho ba 'nete ka seo.
It's a long time.	Ke nako e telele.
I am very happy to give it to her.	Ke thabile haholo ho mo fa eona.
You do not get much out of your work.	Ha u fumane tse ngata mosebetsing oa hau.
Then I learned from them.	Eaba ke ithuta ho bona.
Neither did he.	Le eena ha a ka a etsa joalo.
Where have you been? 	U ne u ntse u le kae?
they asked.	ba botsa.
It will not take long.	E ke ke ea nka nako e telele.
He's beyond all that now.	O feta tseo tsohle jwale.
Again, just my opinion.	Hape, maikutlo a ka feela.
The task was not easy.	Mosebetsi oo o ne o se bonolo.
Just be in front of it.	E-ba feela ka pele ho eona.
And that hurts.	Mme hoo ho bohloko.
He ate quickly and left without saying a word.	A ja kapele mme a tloha a sa re hantle.
That's not the way it happened.	Ha se tsela eo ho etsahetseng ka eona.
Anything you felt was not important.	Eng kapa eng eo u neng u ikutloa eka ha ea bohlokoa.
He did this three times.	O ile a etsa joalo ka makhetlo a mararo.
He is near.	O haufi.
I love you, boy.	Kea u rata, moshanyana.
He felt like a child again.	O ile a ikutloa e le ngoana hape.
What matters is what you do about it.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke seo u se etsang ka bothata boo.
I never wanted to talk to her again.	Ke ne ke se ke sa batle ho bua le eena hape.
You do not find them often.	Ha u li fumane hangata.
What we all need.	Seo bohle re se hlokang.
We do not need your type here.	Ha re hloke mofuta oa hau mona.
It was her fault.	E ne e le molato oa hae.
Don't try to decide anything.	O seke wa leka ho etsa qeto ka letho.
That wasn’t enough for me, though.	Seo se ne se sa lekana bakeng sa ka, leha ho le joalo.
You had a great time.	U bile le nako e monate.
They meant something.	Ba ne ba bolela ho hong.
Now it goes to work.	Hona joale e ea sebetsa.
They want to meet you.	Ba batla ho kopana le uena.
I had to think about it first.	Ke ne ke lokela ho nahana ka eona pele.
He made an unexpected visit to his home.	O ile a etela ha hae a sa lebella.
People will love you more.	Batho ba tla o rata haholo.
Someone did that.	Motho e mong o entse seo.
No one had returned to the area.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a khutla sebakeng seo.
The 'coming' method.	Mokhoa oa 'ho tla'.
If not, well, start reading.	Haeba ho se joalo, hantle, qala ho bala.
Money does not seem to matter.	Chelete ha e bonahale e le ea bohlokoa.
We'll see about that.	Re tla bona ka seo.
That seems enough.	Hoo ho bonahala ho lekana.
We will talk to the parents.	Re tla bua le batsoali.
They were doing their homework.	Ba ne ba etsa mosebetsi oa bona oa sekolo.
He did not decide.	O ne a sa etsa qeto.
Today most people do not even know that your books exist.	Kajeno batho ba bangata ha ba tsebe le hore libuka tsa hau li teng.
Maybe he sees nothing.	Mohlomong ha a bone letho.
That means you can do it all with one click.	Seo se bolela hore o ka etsa tsohle ka potso e le 'ngoe.
It made the most of the news.	E entse litaba ka ho fetisisa.
The fact is, he wanted me to do that.	Taba ke hore o ne a batla hore ke etse joalo.
But somehow he did.	Empa ka tsela e 'ngoe e ile ea etsa joalo.
I knew that.	Ke ne ke tseba seo.
We can go to bed if you like.	Re ka ea robala ha u rata.
Anyway.	Le joalo.

It does not seem so.	Ho bonahala ho se joalo.
That we had to go.	Hore re ne re tlameha ho tsamaea.

Maybe this will help.	Mohlomong sena se tla thusa.
You still can't work.	U ntse u ka sitoa ho sebetsa.
He thought we could be friends.	O ne a nahana hore re ka ba metsoalle.
This would have taken several hours.	Sena se ka be se nkile lihora tse 'maloa.
But they were still important.	Empa li ne li ntse li le bohlokoa.
And when it works, it works.	Mme ha e sebetsa, e sebetsa.
This should not take too long.	Sena ha sea lokela ho nka nako e telele haholo.
I thought it was fun.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho monate.
However, it remained visible.	Leha ho le joalo, e ile ea ’na ea bonahala.
You know, like mine.	Ua tseba, joalo ka ea ka.
I see it happening even more.	Ke e bona e etsahala le ho feta.
Your hair looks very beautiful today.	Moriri oa hau o shebahala o le motle haholo kajeno.
I do not know.	Ha ke tsebe.
However, his head was already there.	Leha ho le joalo, hlooho ea hae e ne e se e le teng.
Just like any other child.	Joalo ka ngoana ofe kapa ofe.
Why is that? 	Hobaneng ha ho le joalo?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
The same has been true of many others.	Ho bile joalo le ka ba bang ba bangata.
It has to go beyond that.	E tlameha ho feta moo.
However, they would not forget his betrayal.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba ke ke ba lebala ho eka ha hae.
You, boy.	Wena, moshanyana.
You can have one without the other.	U ka ba le e 'ngoe ntle le e' ngoe.

But the man did not know her.	Empa monna eo o ne a sa mo tsebe.
Or you are still there.	Kapa o ntse o le teng.
Thank you for that.	Ke leboha seo.
It could mean something.	E ka bolela ho hong.
I can't think of this.	Ha ke khone ho nahana ka taba ena.
You will have to ask him that.	O tla lokela ho mo botsa seo.
Some may be.	Ba bang ba ka ba joalo.
No one had ever known him before.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a tseba ea tšoanang le e mong.
My husband also found it.	Monna oa ka le eena o e fumane.
He tried again.	A leka hape.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
But we buy from it.	Empa re reka ho eona.
But the situation is very clear.	Empa boemo bo hlakile haholo.
So, what is time?	Joale, nako ke eng?
Some of them must be visible, and some must not be visible.	Tse ling tsa tsona li tlameha ho bonahala, 'me tse ling li se ke tsa bonahala.
I do not need your help.	Ha ke hloke thuso ea hau.
These are the realities of life.	Tsena ke lintho tsa sebele tsa bophelo.
They take money.	Ba nka chelete.
The good man returns.	Monna ea molemo oa khutla.
This can happen at any time.	Sena se ka etsahala neng kapa neng.
That it does not go away.	Hore e se ke ea tloha.
There is no danger there.	Haho kotsi moo.
However, I do not understand why.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng.
And so they don't get the help they need '.	'Me kahoo ha ba fumane thuso eo ba e hlokang'.
It is better in my opinion.	E betere ka maikutlo a ka.
You have to get out of there, man.	U tlameha ho tsoa moo, monna.
People loved him!	Batho ba ne ba mo rata!
He had work in the morning.	O ne a na le mosebetsi hoseng.
But this is more than that.	Empa sena se batla se feta moo.
And that would be fine.	Mme hoo ho ka ba hantle.
But he thought it through.	Empa o ile a nahana hantle ka eona.
It has to stop.	E tlameha ho ema.
I don't care what it looks like.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na e shebahala joang.
Others in the area found the same thing.	Ba bang sebakeng seo ba ile ba fumana ntho e tšoanang.
He left that night.	O ile a tsamaea bosiung boo.
We must do a better job at it.	Re tlameha ho etsa mosebetsi o betere ho eona.
We would love to hear from you.	Re ka thabela ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
For harm to man.	Bakeng sa kotsi ho motho.
I really don’t think so.	Ha ke hlile ha ke e nahane joalo.
He found nothing.	Ha a ka a fumana letho.
You can usually do this alone.	Hangata u ka etsa sena u le mong.
He did that.	O entse seo.
It's up to you.	Ho ho uena.
Let's talk about what worked.	A re ke re bue ka se neng se sebetsa.
Something strange is happening.	Ho etsahala ntho e makatsang.
You have to be strong in that area.	U tlameha ho ba matla sebakeng seo.
I'm not feeling well anymore.	Ha ke sa ikutloa hantle.
Start tomorrow morning.	Qala hosane hoseng.
I wish you could come back again.	Ke lakatsa eka u ka khutla hape.

Forever and always.	Ho fihlela le kamehla.
I knew he had to come back.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o tlameha ho khutla.
The reality however allows them space.	'Nete leha ho le joalo e ba lumella sebaka.
I have to eat.	Ke lokela ho ja.
It talks about news, and writes a lot.	E bua ka litaba, 'me e ngola tse ngata.
Do better if you can.	Etsa betere ha o khona.
I had such a wonderful time.	Ke bile le nako e monate hakana.
He is waiting.	O emetse.
It is better to say nothing.	Ho molemo ho bua letho.
He wanted to have children, to have a family.	O ne a batla ho ba le bana, ho ba le lelapa.
Even though you are there now, you are still there.	Le ha o se o le teng hona joale, o ntse o le teng.

He knew he didn't have to do that.	O ne a tseba hore o ne a sa tlameha ho etsa hoo.
He did nothing.	Ha a ka a etsa letho.
Now we don't think about that here.	Joale ha re nahane ka taba eo mona.
He would never forget that.	O ne a sa tlo lebala seo.

I don’t care in any way.	Ha ke tsotelle ka tsela efe kapa efe.
I would not leave him.	Ke ne ke sa tlo mo tlohela.
Work to find.	Sebetsa ho fumana.
However, future issues will be timely.	Leha ho le joalo, litaba tse tlang li tla be li le ka nako.

He could do it.	O ne a ka e etsa.
There are times when.	Ho na le linako tseo ka tsona.
He would give you all the help you need.	O ne a tla u fa thuso eohle.
We think that is not necessary.	Re nahana hore seo ha se hlokahale.
So get this one, and you can keep it out.	Kahoo fumana ena, 'me u ka e boloka ka ntle.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Ke masoabi hore ebe o ile a tsoa kotsi.
And she is naked.	Mme o feela.
I did not get a job because of this.	Ha kea ka ka fumana mosebetsi ka lebaka la sena.
This is what we know now, everyone.	Sena ke seo re se tsebang hona joale, e mong le e mong.
It is what it is.	Ke seo e leng sona.
There are a few of them.	Ho na le tse seng kae tsa tsona.

That was for other days.	Seo e ne e le sa matsatsi a mang.
Clearly, something is wrong.	Ho hlakile hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
Maybe write your own.	Mohlomong ngola ea hau.
One job at a time.	Mosebetsi o le mong ka nako.
Children learn to talk by watching others.	Bana ba ithuta ho bua ka ho shebella ba bang.
If you know you have problems.	Haeba u tseba hore u na le mathata.
Go fast!	Tsamaea kapele!
It took my life.	E nkile bophelo ba ka.
he cried.	a lla.
So soon, we try something else.	Joale haufinyane, re leka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Take him.	U mo nke.
They would have a few more hours.	Ba ne ba tla ba le lihora tse 'maloa ho feta.
The mind is very strong.	Kelello e matla haholo.
They are really powerful.	Ba matla ruri.
She is happy, even though she says she is not there.	O thabile, leha a ka re ha a eo.
They considered him a strong player.	Ba ne ba mo nka e le sebapali se matla.
They wanted to play with it.	Ba ne ba batla ho bapala ka eona.
But money remained a problem.	Empa chelete e ile ea lula e le bothata.
It's up to you.	Ho ho wena.
Children should learn to read and write.	Bana ba lokela ho ithuta ho bala le ho ngola.
You can understand these things.	U ka utloisisa lintho tsena.
I would never have thought that this could happen.	Ke ne nke ke ka nahana hore sena se ka etsahala.
Probably too many.	Mohlomong tse ngata haholo.
Yes, we need that.	E, re hloka seo.
We had a wonderful day.	Re bile le letsatsi le monate.
They are all there!	Kaofela ba teng!
As before.	Joalo ka pele.
But there was nothing to that.	Empa ho ne ho se na letho ho seo.
They can do things.	Ba ka etsa lintho.
I have to use them carefully.	Ke tlameha ho li sebelisa ka hloko.
We did only what we wanted, when we wanted it.	Re ne re etsa feela seo re se batlang, ka nako eo re e batlang.
Is anyone there?	Ho na le motho moo?
He thought it was good, too.	O ne a nahana hore e ntle, hape.
I'm just going to sleep.	Ke ilo robala feela.
That is the mind.	Seo ke kelello.
When I ask you to help him.	Ha ke kopa le uena ho mo thusa.
Thus, he kept his power alone.	Kahoo, o ile a boloka matla a hae a le mong.
He is the only one who matters.	Ke eena feela oa bohlokoa.
Just start doing things and see what happens.	Qala feela ho etsa lintho 'me u bone se etsahalang.
She loves doing things with our kids too.	O rata ho etsa lintho le bana ba rona hape.
Just think of it.	Nahana feela ka taba ena.
It was too late to go home.	E ne e se e le morao haholo ho ya hae.
I have to hear.	Ke tlameha ho utloa.
It is better to let it be dangerous.	Ho molemo ho e lumella hore e be kotsi.
We see that happening here.	Re bona seo se etsahala mona.
He came back with the phone.	O ile a khutla le mohala.
It still exists.	E ntse e le teng.
Nice place, but also amazing.	Sebaka se setle, empa se makatsang hape.
The sun lives another day.	Letsatsi le phela letsatsi le leng.
In fact, he talks a lot about everything.	Ha e le hantle, o bua haholo ka ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
But think about starting with that, and think about your cause.	Empa nahana ka ho qala ka seo, 'me u nahane ka lebaka la hau.
This time is very near.	Nako ena e haufi haholo.
You can try to see if that works.	U ka leka ho bona hore na seo sea sebetsa.
Then my husband left in his car.	Ka mor’a moo monna oa ka oa tsamaea ka koloi ea hae.
They will eat you up when you come back!	Ba tla u ja mpa ha u khutla!
Thank you so much for your time and help.	Ke leboha haholo ka nako le thuso ea hau.
Assume it to be so.	Nka hore ho joalo.
Thanks for the feedback.	Re leboha maikutlo.
Get it right.	E fumane hantle.
I know, because that's what happened to me.	Ke a tseba, hobane ke sona se etsahetseng ho nna.
I love being a mother.	Ke rata ho ba mme.
Keep an eye on how my work is progressing.	Tsoela pele ho bona hore na mosebetsi oa ka o tsoela pele joang.
The rest is not as simple as that.	Tse ling kaofela ha li bonolo joalo.
Be real, genuine and genuine.	Eba oa 'nete, oa' nete le oa 'nete.
It really was about it.	E ne e hlile e le ka eona.
However, do not sleep.	Leha ho le joalo, u se ke ua robala.
Finding it can be very questionable.	Ho e fumana ho ka belaela haholo.
He can't be.	A ke ke a ba teng.
In the end, life can be difficult.	Qetellong, bophelo bo ka ba boima.
It will be fun to come here and play.	Ho tla ba monate ho tla mona ho tla bapala.
Where did he go?	O ile kae.
No one was talking.	Ho ne ho se motho ya buang.
And you really fall.	'Me u hlile u oa.
That's what you do.	Ke seo u se etsang.
Don't even think about it.	U se ke ua ba ua nahana ka eona.
He did not even have to leave the room.	Ha aa ka a tlameha le ho tsoa ka phaposing eo.
However, it should not be easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ea lokela ho ba bonolo.
I seemed incapable of crying.	Ke ne ke bonahala ke sa khone ho lla.
He obviously has a lot of time to think about things.	Ho hlakile hore o na le nako e ngata ea ho nahana ka lintho.
We are not talking about money.	Ha re bue ka chelete.
More is needed.	Ho hlokahala ho feta moo.
It was mine.	E ne e le oa ka.
We should try to give a better impression.	Re lokela ho leka ho fana ka maikutlo a betere.
I like thought and emotion.	Ke rata mohopolo le maikutlo.
We must look for what all children need.	Re tlameha ho batla seo bana bohle ba se hlokang.
I'd like to have a look.	Ke kopa ho e sheba.
There would be no more people like them.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha hlola ho eba le batho ba bang ba kang bona.
But he, think of him.	Empa eena, mo nahane.
Because one has to.	Hobane motho o lokela.
No one else did.	Ha ho le ea mong ea ileng a etsa joalo.
No one.	Ha ho motho.
Anyone who wanted it would find it.	Mang kapa mang ea neng a e batla o ne a tla e fumana.
We have our hands.	Re na le matsoho a rona.
We were busy and it was really fun.	Re ne re phathahane ’me ho ne ho le monate haholo.
The first.	Ea pele.
I do not know that many others will do the same.	Ha ke tsebe hore le ba bang ba bangata ba tla etsa joalo.
Just one.	E 'ngoe feela.
I just have to know what it is.	Ke tlameha feela ho tseba hore na ke eng.
I thought this wanted to know again.	Ke ne ke nahana hore sena se ne se batla ho tseba hape.
It is easy to see why.	Ho bonolo ho bona lebaka.
I wonder when he will return home.	Kea ipotsa hore na o tla khutlela neng hae.
And it was still too late.	Mme e ne e ntse e le morao haholo.
She was a beautiful girl.	E ne e le ngoanana e motle.
It is very important.	E bohlokoa haholo.
I loved her.	Ke ne ke mo rata.
I too learned many things.	Le ’na ke ile ka ithuta lintho tse ngata.

So we have to go.	Kahoo re tlameha ho tsamaea.

At one point, he said.	Ka nako e 'ngoe, o ile a re.
He wondered about that.	A ipotsa ka seo.
I did not find fault.	Ha kea ka ka fumana phoso.
I think the easier it is, the better.	Ke nahana hore ha e le bonolo haholoanyane, e ka ba betere.
We are still doing that.	Re ntse re etsa joalo.
I want to talk about you.	Ke batla ho bua ka wena.
The hours are long.	Lihora li telele.
He seemed to want to help her.	O ne a bonahala a batla ho mo thusa.
My parents got it too.	Batsoali ba ka le bona ba ile ba e fumana.
That would not happen.	Seo se ne se sa tlo etsahala.
Many people were very happy.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba thabile haholo.
We started in the morning.	Re ile ra qala hoseng.
Eat too.	Ja nako.
They ask where we came from.	Ba botsa hore na re tsoa kae.
But they did not have to be.	Empa ba ne ba sa lokela ho ba joalo.
To me, he said he was retiring.	Ho 'na, o itse o tlohela mosebetsi.
Lots of fun.	Lintho tse ngata tse monate.
I would enjoy anything.	Nka thabela eng kapa eng.
The only way out of this place.	Tsela feela ea ho tsoa sebakeng sena.
I'm good at it.	Ke monate ka eona.
We have to fix the way out of here.	Re tlameha ho lokisa mokhoa oa ho tsoa mona.
I work as a teacher.	Ke sebetsa ke le tichere.
They were not many people.	E ne e se batho ba bangata.
I would like to know.	Ke lakatsa ho tseba.
I mean they do good things here.	Ke bolela hore ba etsa lintho tse ntle mona.
What is good for some is not so bad for others.	E ntle ho ba bang ha e mpe haholo ho ba bang.
I am a doctor.	Ke ngaka.
It is a way of life.	Ke tsela ea bophelo.
We've had one of them.	Re bile le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
Dressing makes it all come together.	Ho apara ho etsa hore tsohle li kopane.
Sometimes he does it out of work.	Ka linako tse ling o mo etsa ntle le mosebetsi.
I do not want to be.	ha ke batle ho ba teng.
When you look at it.	Ha o e sheba.
They are new, too.	Li ncha, hape.
I really didn’t know what it could be.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa tsebe hore na e ka ba eng.
We will win easily.	Re tla hlola ha bonolo.
The children learned to ride a bicycle while the other learned to walk.	Bana ba ile ba ithuta ho palama baesekele ha e mong a ithuta ho tsamaea.
It makes for a good life.	E etsa bophelo bo monate.
Eat more often about his subject.	Ja hangata ka taba ea hae.
Do not stand too fast.	U se ke ua ema kapele haholo.
Maybe he had never seen it at all.	Mohlomong o ne a eso e bone ho hang.
I put it on a bit.	Ke ile ka e apara hanyane.
But now he has not decided to do so.	Empa joale ha aa ka a etsa qeto ea ho etsa joalo.
It even means time.	E bile e bolela nako.
But then he leaves.	Empa joale oa tsamaea.
I want you now.	Kea o batla jwale.
But as for the rest.	Empa ha e le ba bang kaofela.
It is a very difficult task.	Ke mosebetsi o boima haholo.
They had no time.	Ba ne ba sena nako.
Otherwise he does nothing.	Ho seng joalo ha a etse letho.
I tell you, it was hard.	Kea le bolella, e ne e le boima.
I wondered where he might be going this time of night.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na e ka ’na eaba o ea hokae nakong ena ea bosiu.
Yes, it was.	E, ho ne ho le joalo.
I'm telling you now.	Ke a o bolella jwale.
Just have it.	E be le eona feela.
But it was good.	Empa e ne e le molemo.
And yes man.	Mme ee monna.
But it is not a problem now.	Empa ha se bothata hona joale.
Keep up the good work.	Tsoela pele hantle.
I can see it all.	Ke khona ho e bona kaofela.
He has been very important to us.	O bile oa bohlokoa haholo ho rona.
But eventually I am gone after my time.	Empa qetellong ha ke le sieo ka mor'a nako ea ka.
I'm fine with that.	Ke hantle le eona.
He says it is useless.	O re ha ho na thuso.
That was really fun.	Seo se ne se le monate ruri.
And so on and so forth.	Le tse ling tse joalo.
One of them is a picture of my son.	E 'ngoe ea tsona ke setšoantšo sa mora oa ka.
However, it is not my business.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se taba ea ka.
That's the way it was.	Ke kamoo ho neng ho le kateng.
He did nothing like that.	Ha aa ka a etsa letho la mofuta oo.
This would not have happened.	Sena se ne se ke ke sa etsahala.
Then we can sit down and have a delicious breakfast.	Joale re ka lula fatše ’me ra ja lijo tsa hoseng tse monate.
We are afraid of not getting enough or getting more than we can afford.	Re tšaba ho se fumane ho lekaneng kapa ho fumana ho feta kamoo re ka khonang.
I will do it for you.	Ke tla u etsetsa eona.
It was a wonderful time.	E ne e le nako e monate.
We have always used to do that, even before.	Ke khale re tloaetse ho etsa joalo, le pele.
I know that's not good.	Kea tseba hore seo ha se setle.
I'm not sure which one is the first.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ea pele ke efe.
Of course, that day came and went.	Ke 'nete hore letsatsi leo le ile la fihla 'me la tsamaea.
You would write a letter.	U ne u tla ngola lengolo.
But all of them came together, crying.	Empa kaofela ha bona ba ile ba kopana, ba lla.
We want to know what happened.	Re batla ho tseba se etsahetseng.
But then he heard something.	Empa joale a utloa ho hong.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
It will never be so bad.	Ha ho mohla e tla ba mpe hakaalo.
He too would not say.	Le eena o ne a ke ke a bolela.
We are very close.	Re haufi haholo.
That means it doesn't look out of place.	Seo se bolela hore ha se bonahale ka ntle ho mokhoa oo.
Listen, my child.	Utloa, ngoana oa ka.
However, be it all, at all.	Leha ho le joalo, e-ba tsohle, ho hang.
But he got out of his car.	Empa a tloha ka koloi ea hae.
It was every man for her.	E ne e le monna e mong le e mong bakeng sa hae.
We do not know how.	Ha re tsebe joang.
He knew her, after all.	O ne a mo tseba, ka mor'a tsohle.
Otherwise, it will work.	Ho seng joalo, e ea sebetsa.
Certainly not where I thought they were.	Ehlile ha se moo ke neng ke nahana hore ba teng.
It was more than that.	E ne e feta moo.
She was easy to love.	O ne a le bonolo ho mo rata.
Not true at all.	Ha se 'nete ho hang.
We've done that before.	Re kile ra etsa seo pele.
Do you have that mindset.	Na u na le kelello eo.
The important thing is to know in advance what they like.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke ho tseba pele ho letsatsi hore na ba rata eng.
It was beautiful, but not beautiful.	E ne e le ntle, empa e se ntle.
Think again.	Nahana hape.
We have never had this kind of problem before.	Ha re e-so be le bothata ba mofuta ona pele.
Fix your hair.	Lokisa moriri oa hau.
My parents were gone.	Batsoali ba ka ba ne ba ile.
They talk about his clothes.	Ba bua ka liaparo tsa hae.
He can't be.	A ka se be jwalo.
It all starts now.	Tsohle li qala hona joale.
In fact, it could be a very bad thing.	Ha e le hantle, e ka ba ntho e mpe hakaalo.
The doctor was very professional.	Ngaka eo e ne e le setsebi haholo.
Thank you.	Kea leboha.
Because there is none.	Hobane haho.
He owned a house.	O ne a e-na le ntlo.
Say nothing about me.	Ho se bue letho ka nna.
Maybe that's what this is all about.	Mohlomong ke sona seo sena se buang ka sona.
There is only one, see.	Ho na le a le mong feela, le a bona.
I read about it.	Ke ile ka bala ka eona.
It was the only thing he could think of.	E ne e le eona feela ntho eo a neng a ka e nahana.
It's too long.	Ke nako e telele haholo.
But, in a way, it is.	Empa, ka tsela e itseng, ho joalo.
We were in the same school.	Re ne re le sekolong se le seng.
I'll have to look at them and see what they are.	Ke tla tlameha ho li sheba 'me ke bone seo li leng sona.
It doesn't really matter to them.	Ha e hlile ha e na taba ho bona.
It has never been so bad.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba ntho e mpe hakaalo.
This if it is often a problem.	Sena haeba hangata ke bothata.
I don’t care about driving.	Ha ke tsotelle ho khanna.
I am sure many will enjoy this.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ba bangata ba tla thabela sena.
He wants to learn something and they want to learn something too.	O batla ho ithuta ho hong mme le bona ba batla ho ithuta ho hong.
She is very happy about it.	E thabile haholo ka eona.
I am the best.	Ke 'na ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Eventually, the truth will emerge.	Qetellong, 'nete e tla bonahala.
He knows the man better than anyone else.	O tseba monna ho feta mang kapa mang.
Do what you can to help.	Etsa seo u ka se khonang ho thusa.
So this is what it is.	Kahoo sena ke seo e leng sona.
And that's not the way it is.	Mme ha se tsela ena.
He could not walk.	O ne a sa khone ho tsamaea.
It has never been true.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba 'nete.
So, you will not be able to win!	Kahoo, u ke ke ua khona ho hlola!
The police will not come here.	Mapolesa a ke ke a tla mona.
Also, he did not sleep all night.	Hape, ha aa ka a robala bosiu bohle.
I just do not understand why you are giving it away.	Ke mpa ke sa utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha u fana ka eona.
Of course, everyone wanted to get there first.	Ke ’nete hore bohle ba ne ba batla ho fihla pele.
Give someone who will take care of you.	Fana ka motho ea tla u hlokomela.
We look at what happened the most.	Re sheba se etsahetseng haholo.
All old, now.	Tsohle tsa khale, joale.
You did well.	O etse hantle.
Will you be there next week?	O tla ba teng bekeng e tlang?
He didn't think of anything else.	O ne a sa nahane letho le leng.
In time, many became good friends.	Ha nako e ntse e ea, ba bangata e ile ea e-ba metsoalle e molemo.
Then there was another group.	Joale ho ne ho e-na le sehlopha se seng.
I knew he had problems.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o na le mathata.
Take one.	Nka e le 'ngoe.
He said he spent his time in the area.	O ile a bolela hore o qetile nako ea hae sebakeng.
I think that hurts a lot.	Ke nahana hore hoo ho bohloko haholo.
As a man and a woman.	Joalo ka monna le mosali.
This was our fault.	Ena e ne e le phoso ea rona.
It just does what it does, and it enjoys doing it.	E etsa feela seo e se etsang, mme e thabela ho e etsa.
He is very strong.	O matla haholo.
That seemed to mean it.	Seo se ne se bonahala se bolela.
Who is to blame?	Ke mang ea nang le molato?
Good guy.	Mohlankana e motle.
See you soon!	Ke tla u bona haufinyane!
Of course not.	Ehlile ha ho joalo.
He still has work to do.	O sa ntse a e-na le mosebetsi oo a lokelang ho o etsa.
But he went beyond that.	Empa o ile a feta moo.
Then they left the place.	Eaba ba tloha sebakeng seo.
I mean anything, man.	Ke bolela eng kapa eng, monna.
Thanks for reading !!.	Ke leboha ho bala!!.
It's not my problem.	Ha se bothata ba ka.
I have a question.	Ke na le potso.
That is definitely not my idea.	Ruri eo ha se mohopolo oa ka.
They had a reason.	Ba ne ba na le lebaka.
I would make beautiful kids with him.	Ke ne ke tla etsa bana ba batle le eena.
Power is not enough.	Matla ha a lekana.
I'm very tired now.	Ke khathetse haholo hona joale.
We can ask him.	Re ka mo botsa.
Lots of other things too.	Lintho tse ling tse ngata hape.
People do not think well.	Batho ha ba nahane hantle.
That, without it, we would not be able to learn it.	Hore, ntle le eona, re ne re ke ke ra ithuta eona.
He needed to be alone, he needed time to think.	O ne a hloka ho ba mong, a hloka nako ea ho nahana.
You were not the one commenting.	Ha se uena ea neng a fana ka maikutlo.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
I will be there.	Ke tla be ke le teng.
My picture is not as good as yours.	Setšoantšo sa ka ha se ntle joaloka sa hau.
They had a car for you.	Ba ne ba e-na le koloi ho uena.
I hope that works.	Ke tšepa hore seo sea sebetsa.
It was fun every day.	E ne e le monate letsatsi le leng le le leng.
Nothing could have been clearer.	Ha ho letho le neng le ka be le hlakile ho feta.
I cry a lot.	Ke lla haholo.
Now, he was certainly gone.	Jwale, ka sebele o ne a ile.
Some of these people will never come back.	Ba bang ba batho bana ba ke ke ba hlola ba khutla.
Everyone has their own ideas.	E mong le e mong o na le maikutlo a hae.
I found that very quickly.	Ke ile ka fumana seo kapele haholo.
I love that about you.	Ke rata seo ka wena.
Everything has its time and its celebration.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le nako ea eona le mokete oa eona.
This is my opinion.	Ena ke maikutlo a ka.
They don't care at all.	Ho hang ha ba tsotelle.
See what's happening here.	Sheba se etsahalang mona.
I have to go to work.	Ke tlameha ho ea mosebetsing.
However, it is not so simple.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
One in three times, it works like that.	Nako e le 'ngoe ho tse tharo, e sebetsa joalo.
He did not give a reason.	Ha a ka a bolela lebaka.
I could not speak.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ho bua.
To innocent children.	Ho bana ba se nang molato.
How long they would stay there no one knew.	Hore na ba ne ba tla lula nako e kae moo ho ne ho se ea tsebang.
I just want to live.	Ke batla ho phela feela.
She saw a doctor this morning.	O bone ngaka hoseng hona.
One day, several hours.	Letsatsi le leng, lihora tse 'maloa.
Life was good, life was good.	Bophelo bo ne bo le monate, bophelo bo le monate.
If he wants to.	Haeba a batla.
Let him do what he has to do.	A ke a etse seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
She is a woman.	Ke mosali.
He doesn't talk much.	Ha a bue haholo.
You need a better book.	U hloka buka e betere.
It would work well for a party.	E ne e tla sebetsa hantle bakeng sa mokete.
Almost all of us found this to be untrue.	Hoo e ka bang kaofela ha rōna re ile ra fumana hore sena hase ’nete.
I look at the time.	Ke sheba nako.
We have no food.	Ha re na lijo.
But maybe they can fix something.	Empa mohlomong ba ka lokisa ho hong.
They could have found this place.	Ba ka be ba fumane sebaka sena.
I didn't care so much.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle hakaalo.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha se taba eo.
Do the same for the back end.	Etsa se tšoanang bakeng sa qetellong ea morao.
It's very difficult, of course, to make it fun.	Ho thata haholo, ha e le hantle, e lokelang ho etsa hore e be monate.
One must learn to live with the problem.	Motho o tlameha ho ithuta ho phela le bothata.
I saw you come out and take his chance.	Ke u bone u tsoa 'me u nka monyetla oa hae.
Maybe they want to think about it.	Mohlomong ba batla ho nahana ka eona.
He felt like he could not go.	O ile a ikutloa eka a ke ke a khona ho ea.
My first and last and only.	Ea ka ea pele le ea ho qetela le feela.
Talk to her about it.	Bua le eena ka eona.
Or a car of some kind.	Kapa koloi ea mofuta o itseng.
Do you have a dog?	O na le ntja?
This is new.	Ena ke e ncha.
That is not enough.	Seo ha sea lekana.
I knew exactly what he wanted.	Ke ne ke tseba hantle hore na o batla eng.
He was just a child.	E ne e le ngoana feela.
But that is not what happened.	Empa ha se se ileng sa etsahala.
He has nothing.	Ha a na letho.
It was no longer dangerous.	Ho ne ho se ho se kotsi.
You tell him what to do, and he does it.	U mo bolella seo a lokelang ho se etsa, 'me oa se etsa.
Of course they are.	Ehlile li teng.
See how you feel.	Bona hore na u ikutloa joang.
It was hard to know what it was about.	Ho ne ho le thata ho tseba hore na e bua ka eng.
He pauses before continuing.	O ema hanyane pele a tsoela pele.
We've been doing this for a long time, too.	Re nkile nako e telele re etsa sena, le rona.
He was always busy.	O ne a dula a phathahane.
However, there were exceptions.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ling.
I think every man should have it.	Ke nahana hore monna e mong le e mong o lokela ho ba le eona.
However, there are no hard feelings.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho na maikutlo a thata.
She looked at him now.	A mo sheba jwale.
But Dad fixed that.	Empa Ntate o ile a lokisa tseo.
It doesn't have to do it.	Ha e hloke ho e etsa.
Who loves you the most for who you are.	Ke mang ea u ratang haholo bakeng sa seo u leng sona.
I did not want to be arrested.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho tšoaroa.
Eventually, things started to go smoothly.	Qetellong lintho li ne li qala ho tsamaea hantle.
There is no mother.	Ha ho mme.
To me, that has it all.	Ho 'na, seo se na le tsohle.
For the second time, he started at home.	Ka lekhetlo la bobeli, o ile a qala hae.
Instead he said nothing.	Ho e-na le hoo ha aa ka a bua letho.
He says he was afraid of them.	O bolela hore o ne a ba tšaba.
Some parents are very comfortable with it.	Batsoali ba bang ba bonolo haholo ka eona.
I hope you will too!	Ke tšepa hore le uena u tla etsa joalo!
You see through them.	U bona ka tsona.
They are bad.	Li mpe.
That is what he loved to do.	Ke seo a neng a rata ho se etsa.
What you say is important.	Seo u se buang ke ntho ea bohlokoa.
I know how this works.	Kea tseba hore na sena se sebetsa joang.
The issue was clear enough.	Taba eo e ne e hlakile ho lekana.
You can only take the first job and do it.	U ka nka mosebetsi oa pele feela 'me ua o etsa.
You do not know his name.	Ha o tsebe lebitso la hae.
He gets a lot of help.	O fumana thuso e ngata.
He ate dinner.	O ile a ja lijo tsa mantsiboea.
They won.	Ba hlola.
She was crying too.	Le eena o ne a lla ehlile.
I did not know that.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe seo.
Maybe he opened it.	Mohlomong o ile a e bula.
I was in the room.	Ke ne ke le ka kamoreng.
There was a problem.	Ho ne ho e-na le bothata.
Yes, they are.	E, li teng.
We were very happy with our stay and would be back again.	Re ne re thabetse ho lula ha rōna haholo ’me re ne re tla khutla hape.
There is one for each of us here and it should fit well.	Ho na le e 'ngoe bakeng sa e mong le e mong oa rona mona mme e lokela ho lekana hantle.
No news.	Ha ho na litaba.
This is very simple.	Sena se bonolo haholo.
Or you can stay right where you are.	Kapa u ka lula hantle moo u leng teng.
I do not.	Ha ke etse joalo.
I will wait until then.	Ke tla ema ho fihlela ka nako eo.
Besides, it is such a long car.	Ntle ho moo, ke koloi e telele hakana.
He doesn't know what's going on.	Ha a tsebe se etsahalang.
Then start the application.	Ka nako eo qala kopo.
They found something nearby, he thought.	Ba fumane ntho e haufi, o ile a nahana.
How he loved them.	Kamoo a neng a ba rata kateng.
And you're saying you don't have a good team.	'Me u ntse u re ha u na sehlopha se setle.
I have an opinion too.	Le 'na ke na le maikutlo.
We need to give you what you want now.	Re lokela ho u fa seo u se batlang hona joale.
I was there for that.	Ke ne ke le teng bakeng sa seo.
Good money.	Chelete e ntle.
He is a man who loves his books very much.	Ke motho ea ratang libuka tsa hae haholo.
But the questions continue.	Empa lipotso li ntse li tsoela pele.
I am an older child.	Ke ngoana e moholo.
However, for today only.	Leha ho le joalo, bakeng sa kajeno feela.
We plan it.	Re e rera.
You can find what you are looking for there.	U ka fumana seo u se batlang moo.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mohlomong ke ntho e ntle.
I will know.	Ke tla tseba.
Instead, that is exactly what happened.	Ho e-na le hoo, ke sona se ileng sa etsahala.
But there was nothing that anyone could do.	Empa ho ne ho se letho leo motho a ka le etsang.
He finally understood.	Qetellong o ile a utloisisa.
The night before, her father had called her.	Bosiung ba pele ho moo, ntate oa hae o ile a mo letsa.
How to achieve this idea.	Mokhoa oa ho fihlela mohopolo ona.
Most people will consider you very happy.	Batho ba bangata ba tla nka hore u thabile haholo.
I've been here all this time.	Ke bile mona nako ena kaofela.
I know this group.	Ke tseba sehlopha sena.
I know, but the question is why.	Kea tseba, empa potso ke hore na hobaneng.
So he would definitely come back here.	Kahoo ka sebele o ne a tla khutlela mona.
Do you need more?	A na u hloka tse ling hape?
Cycling is good for you.	Ho palama baesekele ho molemo ho uena.
Almost no one knows about you.	Hoo e ka bang ha ho motho ea tsebang ka uena.
It might be better to look.	Ho ka ba molemo ho sheba.
The truth was important.	'Nete e ne e le ea bohlokoa.
You can ask questions, too.	U ka botsa lipotso, hape.
But don't tell me that.	Empa u se ke ua mpolella eona.
Thanks again for all your help.	Ke leboha hape ka thuso ea hau kaofela.
I usually do that.	Hangata ke etsa joalo.
I will not leave you here.	Nke ke ka o tlohela mona.
I drove it for the first time.	Ke ile ka e khanna ka lekhetlo la pele.
But you must have time.	Empa o tlameha ho ba le nako.
He did not want her to know.	O ne a sa batle hore a tsebe.
No, my friends.	Ha ho joalo, metsoalle ea ka.
It would not take me too long.	E ne e ke ke ea 'nka haholo.
They said it was not a problem.	Ba ile ba re ha se bothata.
He can say whatever he wants.	A ka bua eng kapa eng eo a e batlang.
Know a little, think more.	Tseba hanyane, nahana haholoanyane.
You can understand it all.	U ka khona ho e utloisisa kaofela.
It has been so long.	E se e le nako e telele hakana.
You can see what you like.	U ka bona seo u se ratang.
We did not have to find a reason to come here.	Ha rea ​​ka ra tlameha ho fumana lebaka la ho tla mona.
That was my first impression.	Eo e neng e le maikutlo a ka a pele.
Each of us has our own preferences.	E mong le e mong oa rona o na le ho ba le seo a se ratang.
Do not try to guess who she is.	U se ke ua leka ho nahana hore na ke mang.
If you do not want to do so.	Haeba u sa batle ho etsa joalo.
But it does help.	Empa hoa thusa.
This was not something he thought he had ever wanted.	Ena e ne e se ntho eo a neng a nahana hore o kile a e batla.
I've never seen it.	Ha ke so e bone.
You can find them here.	U ka li fumana mona.
I would definitely come back.	Ka sebele ke ne ke tla khutla.
This can be so.	Sena se ka ba joalo.
And often it did.	'Me hangata e ne e etsa joalo.
He found it not a matter of simple hours.	O ile a fumana e se taba ea lihora tse bonolo.
Out is out is out.	Ho tsoa ke ho tsoa ke ho tsoa.
He will not make anyone believe him.	A ke ke a etsa hore mang kapa mang a mo lumele.
High altitude.	Sebaka se phahameng.
Do not tell anyone.	U se ke ua bolella motho.
I heard it was very good.	Ke utloile hore e ntle haholo.
He has a lifetime.	O na le nako ea bophelo.
I can only win.	Nka mpa ka hlola.
That was the law.	E ne e le molao oo.
And open with it again.	Le ho bula ka eona hape.
It could not have happened.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha etsahala.
But you know what it is like.	Empa ua tseba hore na ho joang.
I think he does this to feel closer to him.	Ke nahana hore o etsa sena ho ikutloa a le haufi le eena.
They do not make clothes.	Ha ba etse liaparo.
However, I am not sure how I can do that.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke na bonnete ba hore na nka etsa seo joang.
And how they did it.	Le kamoo ba entseng kateng.
This was my place.	Ena e ne e le sebaka sa ka.
It wasn't for me.	E ne e se bakeng sa ka.
He was your son.	E ne e le mora oa hao.
After that, they were together.	Ka mor'a moo, ba ne ba le hammoho.
He never spoke again.	Ha a ka a hlola a bua.
I have to ask my family first.	Ke tlameha ho botsa lelapa la ka pele.
And that is the last one.	Mme hoo ke ho qetela.
There is no room for error.	Haho sebaka sa phoso.
There is a lot of truth in it.	Ho na le 'nete e ngata ho eona.
No, he was not.	Che, o ne a se joalo.
They found nothing, they did not return.	Ha baa ka ba fumana letho, ha baa ka ba khutla.
That's really good stuff.	Ke ntho tse ntle ruri.
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
We have been for about three years now.	Re bile le lilemo tse tharo hoo e ka bang nako ea nako ena.
I don't think so.	Ke nahana hore ha ho joalo.
Need more than anything.	Hloka ho feta eng kapa eng.
Something he could never do again.	Ntho eo a neng a ke ke a hlola a e etsa.
It is new to me, but I am very happy to have found his books.	E ncha ho 'na, empa ke thabile haholo hore ebe ke fumane libuka tsa hae.
Drinking coffee with you will also be good.	Ho noa kofi le uena ho tla ba molemo.
Swim or swim.	Sesa kapa sesa.
But, there is more.	Empa, ho na le ho feta.
I had decided to keep the baby beautiful.	Ke ne ke entse qeto ea ho boloka ngoana e motle.
But he could not go back now.	Empa o ne a sa khone ho khutlela morao joale.
I thought it could stop.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e ka ema.
I think you like the idea.	Ke nahana hore o rata mohopolo oo.
I'm very excited and hope you can watch it.	Ke thabile haholo 'me ke tšepa hore u ka e shebella.
He knew their type.	O ne a tseba mofuta oa bona.
But we will see what happens.	Empa re tla bona se etsahalang.
Spending hours and hours on it.	Ho qeta lihora le lihora ho eona.
He wondered where he would end up.	O ne a ipotsa hore na o tla fihla hokae.
Not bad so far.	Ha ho mpe ho fihlela joale.
There was nothing he could do now.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang hona joale.
He stopped, and tried it again.	A ema, mme a e leka hape.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Sena ha se ntho e mpe.
And they did not.	Mme ha ba ka ba etsa jwalo.
There will be no second chance.	Ho ke ke ha ba le monyetla oa bobeli.
Soon you would find your fault if you could do it.	Haufinyane u ne u tla fumana phoso ea hao haeba u ka e etsa.
And immediately he took my hands.	Mme hang a nka matsoho a ka.
They did not.	Ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
When you read, read.	Ha u bala, bala.
Several times it left us.	Ka makhetlo a 'maloa e ile ea tloha ho rona.
He looked at nothing.	O ile a sheba letho.
Maybe one of them will know it.	Mohlomong e mong oa bona o tla e tseba.
Do it.	E etse joalo.
This suggestion is not new.	Tlhahiso ena ha e ncha.
And they ate.	Mme ba ja.
He is more powerful than ever.	O matla ho feta leha e le neng pele.
But then he sat down and refused to continue.	Empa joale o ile a lula fatše 'me a hana ho tsoela pele.
It's no use.	Ha ho na thuso.
However, it was too late.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se e le morao haholo.
I feel his pain.	Ke utloa bohloko ba hae.
I might come back maybe tonight.	Nka khutla mohlomong bosiung bona.
Tomorrow would be another difficult day.	Hosane e ne e tla ba letsatsi le leng le boima.
This means now.	Sena se bolela hona joale.
This seems to be a new reality.	Sena se bonahala e le 'nete e ncha.
He just needed a chance.	O ne a mpa a hloka monyetla feela.
In fact, he always had it.	Ha e le hantle, kamehla o ne a e-na le eona.
It's been years.	E se e le lilemo.
Or maybe they were friends long before that.	Kapa mohlomong esale e le metsoalle khale pele ho moo.
Of course, that was true.	Ha e le hantle, hoo e ne e le 'nete.
It was so much fun for me.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo ho nna.
She is very busy and has no time for this.	O phathahane haholo mme ha a na nako ya sena.
He knew exactly how she felt.	O ne a tseba hantle feela hore na o ikutloa joang.
We are a family, boy.	Re lelapa, moshanyana.
Even more amazing was that he played well.	Ho makatsang le ho feta ke hore o ne a bapala hantle.
That's exactly what you do.	Ke seo o se etsang hantle.
This was becoming increasingly difficult.	Sena se ne se ntse se e-ba thata le ho feta.
You have some books here.	U na le libuka tse ling mona.
Be very careful!	Hlokomela haholo!
There may be.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe ho na le.
This does not matter now.	Sena ha se taba hona joale.
There is only one way to find out what is going on.	Ho na le tsela e le 'ngoe feela ea ho fumana hore na ho etsahala'ng.
We do not have enough money.	Ha re na chelete e lekaneng.
He just told you.	O sa tsoa o bolella.
When he plays, he looks very tired.	Ha a bapala, o shebahala a khathetse haholo.
I've had it with those things.	Ke bile le eona ka lintho tseo.
It creates a great work environment.	E etsa sebaka se setle sa mosebetsi.
This was certainly true for me.	Ka sebele sena e ne e le ’nete ho ’na.
I thought he should go out again.	Ke ile ka nahana hore o lokela ho tsoela ka ntle hape.
That is why they need it.	Ke ka hona ba e hlokang.
It would do him no good to stay there.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha mo thusa ka letho ho dula feela moo.
I mean, he really was there.	Ke bolela, ehlile o ne a le teng.
He was having trouble sleeping.	O ne a na le bothata ba ho robala.
However, this is not really the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se hlile ha se joalo.
I make breakfast.	Ke etsa lijo tsa hoseng.
Some have already done so.	Ba bang ba se ba entse joalo.
We did not do them.	Ha rea ​​li etsa.
They walked for hours.	Ba ile ba tsamaea lihora tse ngata.
In a few hours.	Ka lihora tse 'maloa.
We didn't do it, man.	Ha rea ​​e etsa, monna.
He even thought of eating it.	O bile a nahana ho e ja.
People know this too.	Batho le bona ba tseba sena.
I made money.	Ke entse chelete.
We are the only ones at that time.	Ke rona feela ka nako eo.
He looked at the picture.	A sheba setšoantšo.
In fact, the most important.	Ha e le hantle, ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
Playing with being a man again.	Ho bapala ka ho ba monna hape.
He did not know where to go.	O ne a sa tsebe moo a lokelang ho ya teng.
It did not work.	Ha ea ka ea sebetsa.
He was waiting.	O ne a emetse.
And then you will feel much better.	'Me joale u tla ikutloa u le betere haholo.
If.	Haeba.
I almost didn't.	Ke ne ke batla ke se.
It is necessary.	Ho hlokahala.
I mean this.	Ke bolela sena.
The point is, it goes out.	Taba ke hore e ea tsoa.
You will hear from him soon.	U tla utloa ho eena haufinyane.
For some reason they both decided not to tell her this.	Ka lebaka le itseng ka bobeli ba ile ba etsa qeto ea ho se mo bolelle sena.
I know, that's not news to anyone.	Kea tseba, tseo ha se litaba ho mang kapa mang.
I wish he could still be there.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka be a ntse a le teng.
How long has he been planning this?	Ke nako e kae a ntse a rera see?
For those who have children you know about him.	Bakeng sa ba nang le bana u tseba ka eena.
It took a long time.	Ho ile ha nka nako e telele.
However, they are not the only ones.	Leha ho le joalo, hase bona feela.
I want my kids to be good at what they do.	Ke batla hore bana ba ka ba be hloahloa ho seo ba se etsang.
The first meal should be simple.	Lijo tsa pele li lokela ho ba bonolo.
I'm fine.	Ke phela hantle.
This line did not work properly.	Mohala ona ha oa ka oa tsamaea hantle.
It will take a long time to get them all.	Ho tla nka nako e telele ho li fumana kaofela.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
He says nothing.	Ha a bue letho.
It's hard to trust.	Ho thata ho tšepa.
Some say they did not do enough.	Ba bang ba re ha baa ka ba etsa ho lekaneng.
But we felt that it was a good thing to do.	Empa re ile ra ikutloa hore seo e ne e le ntho e molemo ho e etsa.
There is no such thing as an easy task.	Ha ho na ntho e kang mosebetsi o bonolo.
I need his help.	Ke hloka thuso ea hae.
He loved his money.	O ne a rata chelete ea hae.
His mind is empty.	Kelello ea hae ha e na letho.
And they kept coming.	Mme ba nna ba tla.
They will find him if we do not find him first.	Ba tla mo fumana ha re sa mo fumane pele.
But he refused.	Empa o ne a hana.
Yes, money.	E, chelete.
I would not ask for more.	Ke ne nke ke ka kopa ho feta.
What made you do it, you ask?	Ke eng e entseng hore u e etse, oa botsa?
I got dressed.	Ke ile ka apara.
So he certainly is the best.	Kahoo ka sebele ke eena ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
I'm new to this.	Ke ncha ho sena.
Only if you really want it.	Feela haeba u batla e le hantle.
Here were many more.	Mona ho ne ho e-na le tse ling tse ngata.
But it never came again.	Empa ha ea ka ea hlola e tla hape.
I like that so much for a girl.	Ke rata joalo ho ngoanana.
I did not take advantage.	Ha kea ka ka nka monyetla.
He was a son.	E ne e le mora.
Now the question is not, but when and where.	Joale potso ha se hore na, empa neng le hokae.
He was sure he was not there.	O ne a na le bonnete ba hore ha a eo.
Or maybe you do not know what to do next.	Kapa mohlomong ha u tsebe hore na u etse eng ka mor'a moo.
And it's just water.	Mme ke metsi feela.
I went back to him.	Ke ile ka khutlela ho eena.
But first things first.	Empa lintho tsa pele pele.
None of us knew what was going on.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea neng a tseba se etsahalang.
However, I do not see that happening.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke bone seo se etsahala.
They won't know where you are, and we can't tell them.	Ba ke ke ba tseba moo o leng teng, mme re ke ke ra ba bolella.
And some of you were.	Mme ba bang ba lona ba ne ba le jwalo.
It would empower him.	E ne e tla mo fa matla.
I think it will work.	Ke nahana hore e tla sebetsa.
Keep doing this.	Tsoela pele ho etsa sena.
He spent the rest of his life there.	O ile a qeta bophelo bohle ba hae moo.
His father said he was very happy, but that was not true.	Ntate oa hae o ile a re o ne a thabile haholo, empa hoo e ne e se ’nete.
Please do it.	Ke kopa o e etse.
You are better at it than I am.	O molemo ho eona ho mpheta.
She is a mother now.	Ke 'm'e hona joale.
This is not dangerous.	Sena ha se kotsi.
Everything is too good to miss.	Tsohle li ntle haholo hore u se ke ua li ngola.
Yes, you can.	E, u ka khona.
And as always everything works fine.	'Me joalo ka ha tsohle li sebetsa hantle.
He did not understand how.	O ne a sa utloisise hore na joang.
I don't know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke efe.
I thanked her very much at that time.	Ke ile ka mo leboha haholo ka nako eo.
He was a man.	E ne e le motho.
It had no chance.	E ne e sena monyetla.
Their first impression was that he was talking all over.	Maikutlo a bona a pele e bile hore o ne a bua kaofela.
But try to look good, too.	Empa leka ho sheba lintho tse ntle, hape.
Walk through life now.	Tsamaea ka bophelo hona joale.
However, this is not always the case.	Leha ho le joalo, hase kamehla ho leng joalo.
He leaves very early in the morning and comes home late.	O tloha hoseng haholo mme o tla hae ka mora nako.
The weight is almost the same.	Boima bo batla bo lekana.
If it is not one thing, it is another.	Haeba e se ntho e le 'ngoe, ke e 'ngoe.
There are a lot of people.	Ho na le batho ba bangata.
He had made sure of it.	O ne a entse bonnete ba eona.
I do not know what will happen.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ho tla etsahalang.
We did not do that.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
You look so much better.	O shebahala o le betere haholo.
Somewhere from everyone and everything.	Sebakeng se seng ho tloha ho bohle le tsohle.
And the lack of it.	Le ho hloka eona.
They actually have a handle.	Ha e le hantle li na le mokhoa oa ho tšoara.
And they all did.	Mme bohle ba etsa jwalo.
But then there was something else.	Empa joale ho ne ho e-na le ntho e ’ngoe hape.
Which is not bad, but it is also not good.	E leng hore ha e mpe, empa le eona ha e ntle.
They started reading a new book when they arrived.	Ba ile ba qala ho bala buka e ncha ha ba fihla.
I can see why people want it so much.	Kea bona hore na ke hobane’ng ha batho ba li batla hakana.
Of course.	Ka 'nete.
As long as they like.	Ka nako e telele kamoo ba ratang.
During this time, you will work every day.	Ka nako ena, o tla sebetsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
They work very well.	Ba sebetsa hantle haholo.
I am very tired today.	Ke khathetse haholo kajeno.
But by !!!.	Empa ka!!!.
We may find an opening for them.	Re ka 'na ra fumana ho bula bakeng sa bona.
However, I did not find her.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke mo fumane.
I felt good about us.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke le monate ho rona.
He studied hard.	O ile a ithuta ka thata.
I hope that when we leave, you will find a car.	Ke tšepa hore ha re tloha, o tla fumana koloi.
It was good to know exactly who was coming after me.	Ho ne ho le molemo ho tseba hantle hore na ke mang ea tlang ka mor'a ka.
I've seen them do the same thing.	Ke ba bone ba etsa sona seo.
We are such a good team.	Re sehlopha se setle joalo.
I look at it carefully.	Ke e sheba ka hloko.
She feels tired.	O ikutloa a khathetse.
You know better than they do.	U tseba ho feta bona.
They are moving.	Li ntse li tsamaea.
He can have it too.	Le eena a ka ba le eona.
He bought a book.	O ile a reka buka.
You seem to be getting your chance.	Ho bonahala eka o fumana monyetla oa hau.
I start in this place.	Ke qala sebakeng sena.
But he had given up.	Empa o ne a ile a e tlohela.
He was behind her now.	O ne a le ka mora hae jwale.
Only money makes.	Ke chelete feela e etsang.
We could only see it from the outside.	Re ne re e bona feela ka ntle.
Of course I'm not an expert yet.	Ehlile ha ke setsebi empa .
Think of the truth.	Nahana ka 'nete.
It will be fun for them.	Ho tla ba monate ho bona.
Things can be good, as he says, good.	Lintho li ka ba hantle, joalo ka ha a ka re, li ntle.
I mean, he does.	Ke bolela, o etsa jwalo.
It was hard for me.	Ho ne ho le thata ho nna.
There is nothing you can do about this.	Ha ho letho leo u ka le etsang ka sena.
Nothing important will happen.	Ha ho letho la bohlokoa le tla etsahala.
But the problem remains.	Empa bothata bo ntse bo le teng.
I hope you are not doing anything important.	Ke tšepa hore ha u etse letho la bohlokoa.
I really look forward to this.	Ke hlile ke lebeletse sena.
He had been here before.	O ne a kile a fihla mona.
Here it is.	Ke hona mona.
He told them he wanted a son.	O ile a ba bolella hore o batla ho ba le mora.
No one knows.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang.
Her mother took my house and my children.	'Mè oa hae o ile a nka ntlo ea ka le bana ba ka.
This is a very tasty meal.	Ena ke lijo tse monate haholo.
He only took one moment.	O ile a nka nako e le 'ngoe feela.
Or you may not have to search.	Kapa mohlomong u ke ke ua tlameha ho batla.
Of course, he did not understand that question either.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a sa utloisise le potso eo.
He studied hard at school.	O ile a ithuta ka thata sekolong.
But you are obviously a good person.	Empa ho hlakile hore le uena u motho ea motle.
Make it beautiful.	Etsa hore e be ntle.
They needed their parents.	Ba ne ba hloka batsoali ba bona.
So, we made this decision.	Ka hona, re ile ra etsa qeto ena.
I really like it.	Ke hlile ke e rata.
First, decide what you want.	Pele, etsa qeto ea hore na u batla eng.
I am leaving in the morning.	Ke tsamaea hoseng.
Every day is better than the last.	Letsatsi le leng le le leng le molemo ho feta la ho qetela.
And so they worked better.	Mme ka hona ba ile ba sebetsa betere.
Yet none of this is happening.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho letho la sena le etsahalang.
But she was not sure why.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
I went back.	Ke ile ka khutlela morao.
The same is true for you.	Ho joalo le ka uena.
Me too, man.	Le 'na, monna.
There was nothing in common with us.	Ho ne ho se letho leo re tšoanang ka lona.
It wasn't a bad thing but we can't go back.	E ne e se ntho e mpe empa re ke ke ra khutla.
He spends the rest of his life there.	O qeta bophelo bohle ba hae moo.
I have problems.	Ke na le mathata.
They speak well.	Ba bua hantle.
They were friends.	E ne e le metsoalle.
Everything there is there seems to be old and new at the same time.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e teng moo e bonahala e le ea khale le e ncha ka nako e le 'ngoe.
I would stay there again.	Ke ne ke tla lula moo hape.
He speaks to them all.	O bua le bona kaofela.
Life, then nothing.	Bophelo, ebe ha ho letho.
All you have to do is stay there.	Seo u lokelang ho se etsa ke ho lula moo.
It makes you think these people know what they are doing.	E etsa hore u nahane hore batho bana ba tseba seo ba se etsang.
I will do more than that soon.	Ke tla etsa ho feta moo haufinyane.
I can't memorize it, really.	Ha ke khone ho e utloisisa ka hlooho, ha e le hantle.
Maybe he's just shy.	Mohlomong o lihlong feela.
You will think of something.	U tla nahana ka ho hong.
It knows them as they are.	E ba tseba kamoo ba leng kateng.
There were those who just didn’t like my style.	Ho na le ba neng ba sa rate mokhoa oa ka feela.
I do not want you.	ha ke o batle.
I did not know if the man could read.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na monna eo o khona ho bala.
Here is another call to help you.	Mona ke mohala o mong oa ho u thusa.
That means at the same time others.	Seo se bolela hore ka nako e tšoanang ba bang.
That is exactly what happened.	Ke sona se etsahetseng hantle.
This is exactly the same thing.	Ena ke ntho e tšoanang hantle.
One.	O mong.
There were no police at all.	Ho ne ho se na mapolesa ho hang.
I can certainly move on.	Ka 'nete ke khona ho tsoela pele.
It was too early for this.	E ne e le hoseng haholo bakeng sa sena.
We had a great time.	Re bile le nako e monate.
Only one is coming.	Ho ntse ho tla a le mong feela.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
He wanted to ask, but he did not have time.	O ne a batla ho botsa, empa a se na nako.
True, but it is fun to play.	Ke 'nete, empa ho monate ho bapala.
Then he realized something else.	Eaba o hlokomela ntho e ’ngoe hape.
He can be of great help to us.	A ka re thusa haholo.
Not too much.	Ha e ngata haholo.
He wanted to know why.	O ne a batla ho tseba lebaka.
We thank them.	Re ba leboha .
Maybe they would try.	Mohlomong ba ne ba tla leka.
But don't stay too long, now.	Empa o seke wa dula nako e telele, jwale.
The man says it was very important to the boy.	Monna eo o re e ne e le ea bohlokoa haholo ho moshanyana eo.
I mean you don't need to say anything.	Ke bolela hore ha o hloke ho bua letho.
They do not fully understand what it means.	Ha ba utloisise hantle feela hore na e bolela eng.
It is very difficult.	Ho thata haholo.
We will stand as a family.	Re tla ema re le lelapa.
Nice to meet you in the end.	Ho monate ho kopana le uena qetellong.
Everyone knows now.	E mong le e mong oa tseba joale.
You really look like one now.	Ka sebele u shebahala joaloka e mong hona joale.
You want to try many new things!	U batla ho leka lintho tse ngata tse ncha!
A long time ago now.	Khale khale joale.
Mary enters.	Maria oa kena.
One, they start at night.	E 'ngoe, ba qala bosiu.
The strongest were able to survive.	Ba matla ka ho fetisisa ba ile ba khona ho phela.
In fact, he was alone.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a le mong.
Those who wanted to pay, paid.	Ba neng ba batla ho lefa, ba lefa.
If money is needed, give it.	Haeba ho hlokahala chelete, fana ka eona.
None of us could live without you now.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea neng a ka phela ntle le uena hona joale.
I did not know him for a long time.	Ke ne ke sa mo tsebe nako e telele.
If he wants to talk, he can go ahead.	Haeba a batla ho bua, a ka ea pele.
You really need a good time.	O hlile o hloka nako e monate.
But he also said "do your best."	Empa hape o itse "etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang."
I can't understand it.	Ha ke khone ho e utloisisa.
It never mentioned me.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea bua ka 'na.
You need to consider the type of water in your area.	U lokela ho nahana ka mofuta oa metsi sebakeng sa hau.
I heard them.	Ke ba utloile.
Where do you want to go?	U batla ho ea hokae?
The default is not available.	Ea kamehla ha e eo.
Nothing is too powerful.	Ha ho matla letho.
It's easy to do.	Ho bonolo ho e etsa.
We wanted you to know that we had some problems.	Re ne re batla hore le tsebe hore re bile le mathata.
That's what you're going to have to use.	Ke eona ntho eo u tla tlameha ho e sebelisa.
And that dog I love.	Le ntja eo ke e rata.
Some people believed that this was true.	Batho ba bang ba ne ba lumela hore sena ke ’nete.
That we loved him.	Hore re ne re mo rata.
They both play well now.	Ka bobeli ba bapala hantle hona joale.
He was a doctor.	E ne e le ngaka.
You're doing well.	U ntse u sebetsa hantle.
I often have trouble sleeping.	Hangata ke na le bothata ba ho robala.
Tell us.	U re bolelle.
We would appreciate your feedback.	Re ka thabela maikutlo a hau.
But they would know what was going on.	Empa ba ne ba tla tseba se etsahalang.
She felt very happy.	O ile a ikutloa a thabile haholo.
He ate and drank alone.	O ne a ja a ba a noa a le mong.
I will not let you go.	Nke ke ka o tlohela.
It seemed three times as far as the road.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka tsela e telele ka makhetlo a mararo e tsamaea ka tsela ena.
It was not a family.	E ne e se lelapa.
Maybe this was it.	Mohlomong sena e ne e le sona.
However, the scenery was good.	Leha ho le joalo, sebaka se setle se ne se le setle.
I did the same for myself.	Ke entse joalo ka 'na.
Which he certainly did not do.	E leng seo ka sebele a sa kang a se etsa.
In fact, it was the only issue.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le eona feela taba.
I knew it well.	Ke ne ke e tseba hantle.
Yes, that's right.	E, ho joalo.
Then there is the problem.	Ebe bothata.
It's still you.	U ntse u le uena.
However, he could have come earlier.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a ka tla pele ho nako.
I had this.	Ke ne ke ena le sena.
So, this is both.	Kahoo, sena ke bobeli.
But then, when you start.	Empa joale, ha o qala.
I don’t know if they were bad.	Ha ke tsebe haeba li ne li le mpe.
Your danger, therefore, will be imminent.	Kotsi ea hau, ka hona, e tla ba haufi.
Are you still.	Na u ntse u.
Sometimes by me.	Ka linako tse ling ka 'na.
I'm sure you can do it.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore u ka e etsa.
It says nothing about their feelings.	Ha e bue letho ka maikutlo a bona.
Of course he was hurt.	Ke ’nete hore o ne a utloile bohloko.
That is his decision.	Ke qeto ea hae.
They just gave him anything.	Ba ne ba mpa ba mo fa eng kapa eng feela.
He said there was no problem with the first call.	O ile a re ho ne ho se bothata ka mohala oa pele.
It's no harder than finding it.	Ha ho thata ho feta ho u fumana.
This is my new car.	Ena ke koloi ea ka e ncha.
He did it first.	O e entse pele.
Only time would tell.	Ke nako feela e neng e tla bolela.
He did not stay long.	Ha aa ka a ema nako e telele.
She was beautiful.	O ne a le motle.
So keep learning, and do not be afraid to learn something new.	Kahoo tsoela pele ho ithuta, u se ke ua tšaba ho ithuta ntho e ncha.
It was good, though.	E ne e le ntle, leha ho le joalo.
So, what did it look like?	Joale, e ne e shebahala joang?
It never does that.	Ha ho mohla e etsang joalo.
I will be close.	Ke tla ba haufi.
None of us have ever seen that before.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea kileng a bona seo ho eena pele.
I have problems.	Ke na le mathata.
The psychologist asked the children to talk.	Setsebi sa kelello se ile sa kōpa bana hore ba bue.
I think it's fun.	Ke nahana hore e monate.
Moreover, it is easy to do.	Ho feta moo, ho bonolo ho e etsa.
But the years were not over.	Empa lilemo li ne li se moo.
He wanted to give her everything.	O ne a batla ho mo fa tsohle.
Do not eat bad food.	U se ke ua ja lijo tse mpe.
By then it was too late.	Ka nako eo e ne e se e le morao haholo.
However, they had to wait a little longer.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ile ba tlameha ho ema ho se hokae.
I thought we had.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re na le.
Do not leave it.	U se ke ua tloha ho eona.
If you can save it.	Ha o ka e boloka.
He comes to us to ask for our help.	O tla ho rona ho kopa thuso ea rona.
Probably everything they could ever want or need came to an end.	Mohlomong ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo ba neng ba ka e batla kapa eo ba e hlokang e ile ea fihla qetellong.
So it was really fun.	Kahoo e bile monate haholo.
Try something new!	Leka ntho e ncha!
Sit down, please.	Dula ka kopo.
It doesn't matter, baby.	Ha ho na taba, ngoana.
It just stays.	Ho dula feela.
Or better.	Kapa ho betere.
You have been there for a long time.	U bile teng ka nako e telele.
They are accustomed to eating well.	Ba tloaetse ho ja hantle.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
I use it and it only works for me.	Kea e sebelisa 'me e sebetsa ho' na feela.
I should never have gone to him.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho ea ho eena le ka mohla.
Then, the phone rings.	Joale, mohala oa lla.
Whenever he got a chance, he took it.	Nako le nako ha a ne a fumana monyetla, o ne a o nka.
And again.	Mme hape.
Your name.	Lebitso la hau.
It seemed to work.	E ne e bonahala e sebetsa.
The man was a doctor.	Monna e ne e le ngaka.
My mind was very active.	Kelello ea ka e ne e sebetsa haholo.
That would have been fun.	Hoo ho ka be ho bile monate.
And this is not what we expected.	Hape sena ha se seo re neng re se lebeletse.
He sat there for a long time, thinking about last night.	O ile a dula moo nako e telele, a nahana ka bosiu bo fetileng.
And now he has.	Mme jwale o entse jwalo.
He came home, and we never talked about it.	O ile a tla hae, ’me ha ho mohla re kileng ra bua ka hona.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha ba etse joalo.
You can do it now.	U ka e etsa hona joale.
And there may be.	Mme ho ka ba teng.
One day we will definitely be grateful !.	Ka letsatsi le leng ka sebele re tla leboha!.
However, they already understood.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba se ba utloisisa.
That was very clear.	Seo se ne se hlakile haholo.
He said he did not want to return.	O ile a re ha a batle ho khutla.
If they were there.	Haeba ba ne ba le teng.
Sometimes a little more.	Ka linako tse ling ho feta hanyane hanyane.
I will be back next year.	Ke tla khutla selemong se tlang.
We had to do it again.	Re ile ra tlameha ho e etsa hape.
We've been together all this time.	Re bile hammoho nako ena kaofela.
Apply for a specific position.	Etsa kopo bakeng sa boemo bo itseng.
I am sure it is.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ho joalo.
You are the first in a long, long time.	Ke uena oa pele ka nako e telele, e telele joalo.
He found it and left.	O ile a e fumana mme a tloha.
It already knew its original way.	E ne e se e ntse e tseba tsela ea eona ea pele.
Then go with you.	Joale tsamaea le uena.
And sleep well.	Le ho robala hantle.
He made a lot of money that year.	O ile a etsa chelete e ngata selemong seo.
It was up to me.	E ne e le ho nna.
He is her son.	Ke mora oa hae.
He did not finish eating.	Ha a ka a qeta ho ja.
But a little bit of both.	Empa hanyane ka bobeli.
This was my favorite thing.	Ena e ne e le seo ke se ratang haholo.
Time travel for this happens.	Nako ea ho tsamaea ha sena se etsahala.
I have never told anyone.	Ha ke so bolelle motho.
More than ever before.	Ho feta leha e le neng pele.
It's always nice to have time with you.	Ho monate kamehla ho nna ho ba le nako le uena.
He never came in for a long time.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a kena ka nako e telele.
Now, here's the thing.	Joale, taba ke ena.
It did not matter.	Ho ne ho se na taba.
It’s usually not too much.	Hangata ha e ngata haholo.
No one was in front of him.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a le ka pele ho eena.
He did that.	O entse seo.
It was the last day of the class.	E ne e le letsatsi la ho qetela la sehlopha sena.
The weight of the object.	Boima ba ntho.
After a while, my mother nodded.	Ka mor’a nako, ’Mè o ile a lumela ka hlooho.
We help to catch it.	Re thusa ho e tšoara.
Or maybe longer than that.	Kapa mohlomong nako e telele ho feta moo.
Now is our time.	Joale ke nako ea rona.
But until they do, we do not know.	Empa ho fihlela ba etsa joalo, ha re tsebe.
His car is old, but it goes well.	Koloi ea hae ke ea khale, empa e tsamaea hantle.
And not only can you say it, there is also time to say it.	Mme ha se feela seo o ka se buang, ho na le nako ea ho se bua.
We talked for hours.	Re ile ra bua lihora tse ngata.
I want it all.	Ke e batla kaofela.
Now he needs money.	Hona joale o hloka chelete.
When I'm here, I'm not speaking right.	Ha ke le mona, ha ke bua hantle.
It is not very useful.	Ha e na thuso haholo.
He is always able to do better than harm.	O lula a khona ho etsa se molemo ho feta kotsi.
Why, he didn't know.	Hobaneng, o ne a sa tsebe.
And so he was helpful that way.	Mme ka hona o ne a na le thuso ka tsela eo.
I have everything.	Ke na le ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
I will never do it again.	Ha ke sa tla khutla ho e etsa hape.
He never believed in any form.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a lumela mokhoa ofe kapa ofe.
They look good.	Li shebahala li le molemo.
We need your feedback.	Re hloka maikutlo a hau.
You can't think of it.	U ke ke ua nahana ka eona.
He told his friends that he would return, but he did not.	O ile a bolella metsoalle ea hae hore o tla khutla, empa ha aa ka a khutla.
There it is again.	Ke eo hape.
It takes so long to fix one thing.	Ho nka nako e telele hakana ho lokisa ntho e le 'ngoe.
But he did not do it often.	Empa o ne a sa e etse hangata.
From the workplace.	Ho tloha sebakeng sa mosebetsi.
I can see why he loves them.	Kea bona hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ba rata.
It was fun.	Ho ne ho bile monate.
He told her but well.	O ile a mo bolella empa hantle.
That is to say there is an opinion.	Ke ho re ho na le maikutlo.
Although there are days.	Leha ho na le matsatsi.
He certainly had his mind.	Ka sebele o ne a e-na le kelello ea hae.
This is definitely planning for a very long time !.	Ka sebele sena se rera nako e telele haholo!.
I'm not sure how you did it.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na u e entse joang.
Looking.	Ho sheba.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
It says if.	E re haeba.
Somehow it was better tonight.	Ka tsela e itseng ho ne ho le betere bosiung bona.
If it were possible, we would have loved it.	Haeba ho ne ho ka etsahala, re ka be re ile ra e rata.
You have.	U bile le .
He knew what was in it.	O ne a tseba se neng se le teng.
He spoke the truth.	O ile a bua ka 'nete.
I was for another guy.	Ke ne ke le bakeng sa mohlankana e mong.
They did not even explain why they were doing this.	Ha baa ka ba bolela le hore na ke hobane’ng ha ba etsa joalo.
That's a kind of question.	Ke potso ea mofuta oo.
But I could not.	Empa ha kea khona.
You have to let them.	U lokela ho ba lumella.
It doesn't look like it can fix it.	Ha e bonahale e ka e lokisa.
You will enjoy it.	O tla e thabela.
It keeps you busy.	E u boloka u phathahane.
You have to start saying things will get easier.	O tlameha ho qala ho bolela hore lintho li tla ba bonolo.
Anyone can be great.	Mang kapa mang a ka ba moholo.
Is it me? 	Na ke 'na?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
I need help.	Ke kopa thuso.
I couldn’t do that, though.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho etsa joalo, leha ho le joalo.
So there is always that.	Kahoo kamehla ho na le seo.
He is not a man.	Ha se motho.
I will not tell anyone who you are.	Ha ke na ho bolella mang kapa mang hore na u mang.
This has been fun.	Sena se bile monate.
I do not know who he is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke mang.
And that was gone.	Mme seo se ne se ile.
If so, find this way of speaking.	Haeba ho joalo, ho fumana mokhoa ona oa ho bua.
No time now.	Haho nako jwale.
I wonder what they will find in his house.	Kea ipotsa hore na ba tla fumana eng ha hae.
It can't let it.	Ha e khone ho e lumella.
I like to write.	Ke rata ho ngola.
For the son.	Bakeng sa mora.
Just look at this picture.	Sheba setšoantšo sena feela.
Power is still good.	Matla a ntse a le molemo.
It is coming soon.	E tla haufinyane.
And there is no time like now.	'Me ha ho nako e tšoanang le ea joale.
For us it is a very important issue.	Ho rona ke taba ea bohlokoa haholo.
What would you do.	U ka etsa'ng.
You are a human being.	U motho oa batho.
One day, with the same news.	Letsatsi le leng, le litaba tse tšoanang.
But that is not true, it is not.	Empa ha se 'nete, ha ho sa le joalo.
It was really something to visit.	E ne e hlile e le ntho ea ho etela.
I always wanted to do it for her.	Ke ne ke batla ho mo etsa kamehla.
It was useless to play him.	Ho ne ho se na thuso ho mo bapala.
For just one thing.	Bakeng sa ntho e le 'ngoe feela.
Thank you for your help.	Kea leboha ka thuso ea hau.
He was glad to hear that.	O ile a thabela ho utloa seo.
He did nothing wrong, which he could see.	O ne a sa etsa letho le phoso, leo a neng a ka le bona.
That would have been worse.	Seo se ka be se bile mpe le ho feta.
No news, nothing to say.	Ha ho litaba, ha ho letho leo u ka le buang.
Maybe he even understood.	Mohlomong o bile a utloisisa.
He looked at it sadly.	A e sheba ka masoabi.
A few more days and we may be able to travel again.	Matsatsi a mang a 'maloa' me re ka khona ho tsamaea hape.
That you have never seen.	Eo ha o eso bone.
This one works.	Ena ea sebetsa.
It will go away.	E tla tloha.
I would never do it again.	Ke ne nke ke ka hlola ke e etsa hape.
To tell him how he was talking about me.	Ho mo bolella kamoo a neng a bua ka nna kateng.
If only he could see.	Hoja a ka bona feela.
He used to talk a lot when he came back.	O ne a tloaetse ho bua haholo ha a khutla.
Nobody wanted to do that.	Ho ne ho se motho ya neng a batla ho etsa seo.
I know many others who have done it.	Ke tseba ba bang ba bangata ba e entseng.
I had done them many times.	Ke ne ke kile ka li etsa hangata.
However, there is nothing wrong with it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho letho le phoso ka eona.
We do not need to talk.	Ha ho hlokahale hore re bue.
But now we know how it worked.	Empa joale rea tseba hore na e ile ea sebetsa joang.
He told me exactly how he was going to do it.	O ile a mpolella hantle hore na o tla e etsa joang.
It is even more so.	Ho joalo le ho feta.
None of these were present.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsena e neng e le teng.
Everyone needs help.	E mong le e mong o hloka thuso.
He knew what he was doing.	O ne a tseba seo a se etsang.
He knew they would be enough.	O ne a tseba hore ba tla lekana.
He does this with the help of his family.	O etsa sena ka thuso ea lelapa la hae.
I had to be something else.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho ba ntho e 'ngoe hape.
There were no bad things.	Ho ne ho se na lintho tse mpe.
Or maybe they had it.	Kapa mohlomong ba ne ba e-na le eona.
That old dog has trouble seeing.	Ntja eo ea khale e na le bothata ba ho bona.
That was a possibility.	Seo e ne e le ntho e ka etsahalang.
There you go, now you know.	Ke moo, jwale o ya tseba.
We don't need his type here.	Ha re hloke mofuta wa hae mona.
You can do so many things.	U ka etsa lintho tse ngata haholo.
I'll be back with the police.	Ke tla khutla le mapolesa.
But don't tell me.	Empa u se ke ua mpolella.
I told her that at the time.	Ke ile ka mo bolella joalo ka nako eo.
Sometimes he did not know where he was.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a sa tsebe moo a leng teng.
And he can be.	Mme a ka ba jwalo.
Who will be the strongest?	Ke mang ea tla ba matla ka ho fetisisa?
They spoke in every way.	Ba ile ba bua ka mokhoa o mong le o mong.
Or future days.	Kapa matsatsi a nakong e tlang.
There was none.	Ho ne ho se na.
Which really means a lot of writing.	E leng hore ehlile ho bolela ho ngola haholo.
I'm not the same person you used to know.	Ha ke motho ea tšoanang le eo u neng u mo tseba.
He had decided to quit.	O ne a entse qeto ea hore o tla tlohela.
Some people have problems.	Batho ba bang ba na le mathata.
We just want to spend the night here.	Re mpa re batla ho hlola bosiu mona.
But you obviously do not like him.	Empa ho hlakile hore ha o mo rate.
There are not many.	Ha ho na tse ngata.
But this was not the case.	Empa e ne e se hona.
But you never say.	Empa ha ho mohla u buang.
Type of arrest.	Mofuta oa ho tšoaroa.
They hug, some cry.	Ba hakana, ba bang ba lla.
You will be happy, no problem.	U tla thabela, ha ho bothata.
The reason for this is obvious.	Lebaka la sena le hlakile.
I have friends.	Ke na le metsoalle.
He does not need to be close to children's time.	Ha ho hlokahale hore a be haufi le nako ea bana.
If you are tired, go to bed.	Haeba u khathetse, robala.
It was just fine.	E ne e le hantle feela.
Finally, your wife arrives.	Qetellong, mosali oa hao oa fihla.
If it is not enough, you can use water.	Haeba e sa lekana, o ka sebelisa metsi.
I had to play it down.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho e bapala fatše.
It's my business to know.	Ke taba ea ka ho tseba.
He said he had not.	A re ha a eso.
This did not work.	Sena ha sea sebetsa.
Risk to take.	Kotsi eo u lokelang ho e nka.
You are very gentle.	U ba bonolo haholo.
No one said anything good.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a bua letho le molemo.
Yes, we know about it.	E, re tseba ka eona.
You do not need to know.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u tsebe.
You are an adult.	O motho e moholo.
I watched and watched.	Ke ile ka shebella 'me ka shebella.
He would have to.	O ne a tla tlameha.
This can be helpful if one is in need.	Sena se ka thusa haeba motho a hloka.
But even that would not be enough.	Empa le hoo ho ke ke ha lekana.
I did not leave him.	Ha kea ka ka tsoa ho eena.
Thank you !.	Kea leboha !.
Working is not that difficult.	Ho sebetsa ha ho thata hakaalo.
He said nothing.	Ha a ka a bua letho.
I will not do anything stupid.	Ha ke na ho etsa letho le hlokang kelello.
You can do it again.	U ka e etsa hape.
You can do it or not.	O ka e etsa kapa ha o e etse.
What is mine is yours.	Seo e leng sa ka ke sa hao.
This is just another one.	Ena ke e 'ngoe feela.
He has always wanted to give her everything.	Haesale a batla ho mo fa tsohle.
He just wanted to play with her.	O ne a batla feela ho bapala le eena.
He probably did.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe o ile a etsa joalo.
She had amazing hair.	O ne a ena le moriri o makatsang.
It was really hard for them.	Ehlile ho bile thata ho bona.
We could not pass.	Ha rea ​​khona ho feta.
People suffer all the time.	Batho ba utloa bohloko ka linako tsohle.
It also did not work.	Le eona ha ea ka ea sebetsa.
Same reason for others.	Lebaka le tšoanang ho ba bang.
He thought he might know something.	A nahana hore a ka tseba ho hong.
It was time to go eat.	E ne e le nako ya ho ya ja.
They will not be caught alive, and they know it.	Ba ke ke ba tšoaroa ba ntse ba phela, 'me baa tseba.
Sit in a room.	Dula ka phaposing.
He had seen the worst.	O ne a bone tse mpe ka ho fetisisa.
I don't need it.	ha ke e hloke.
I would like to start studying at this time.	Ke kopa ho qala ho ithuta ka nako ea.
He does the same.	Le eena o etsa joalo.
Well, almost all of them.	Hantle, hoo e ka bang bohle.
Eat mentally.	Ja ka kelello.
They will be better than nothing.	Ba tla be ba le betere ho feta letho.
Of course you can learn to ride it.	Ehlile u ka ithuta ho e palama.
But now, they understood.	Empa joale, ba ile ba utloisisa.
In this work, we think of the first method.	Mosebetsing ona, re nahana ka mokhoa oa pele.
Man cannot speak.	Motho ha a khone ho bolela.
You wanted to be healthy with him.	U ne u batla ho phela hantle le eena.
I talked to him all the time.	Ke ne ke bua le eena ka linako tsohle.
He told me that every time.	O ile a mpolella seo nako le nako.
And, it is important for another reason.	'Me, ho bohlokoa ka lebaka le leng.
There is something here.	Ho na le se seng mona.
He decided to get out.	A etsa qeto ea ho tsoa.
Books should only go to those who can afford them.	Libuka li lokela ho ea feela ho ba khonang ho li reka.
There is no reason.	Ha ho na lebaka.
The passing of time also helped.	Ho feta ha nako ho ile ha thusa hape.
It is all or nothing.	Ke tsohle kapa ha ho letho.
Then real fun begins.	Joale monate oa sebele oa qala.
That was not a problem.	Seo e ne e se bothata.
This is a difficult subject to talk about.	Ena ke taba e thata ho bua ka eona.
Nor should they.	Kapa ha baa lokela ho ba joalo.
Play with her children.	Bapala le bana ba hae.
This year, he must be.	Selemong sena, o tlameha ho ba joalo.
I understand your point of view.	Ke utloisisa maikutlo a hau.
Now, you probably will.	Joale, mohlomong u tla etsa joalo.
Let's say that is not the case.	A re re ha ho joalo.
You'll see, it goes to work.	U tla bona, e ea sebetsa.
Or you can tell us what you know.	Kapa u ka re bolella seo u se tsebang.
Well, every day you learn something new.	Hantle, letsatsi le letsatsi o ithuta ntho e ncha.
That was not something he needed to hear.	Eo e ne e se ntho eo a neng a lokela ho e utloa.
And she loves her job.	Mme o rata mosebetsi wa hae.
He looked older than he was.	O ne a shebahala a le moholo ho feta lilemo tsa hae.
She met her husband while working here.	O kopane le monna oa hae ha a ntse a sebetsa mona.
It was a good team.	E ne e le sehlopha se setle.
We will do the same.	Le rona re tla etsa joalo.
She tried to be the mother she needed.	O ile a leka ho ba 'mè eo a neng a mo hloka.
It is a way of life without a tool.	Ke mokhoa oa ho phela ntle le sebetsa.
I have the power to do that.	Ke na le matla a ho etsa joalo.
It is important to read.	Ho bohlokoa ho bala.
New car.	Koloi e ncha.
A lot of things are happening here.	Ho etsahala lintho tse ngata mona.
And, of course, they did.	Mme, ruri, ba ile ba etsa jwalo.
He said it was yours.	O itse ke ea hau.
Or so they thought.	Kapa ba ne ba nahana joalo.
If you do not do so we will find another way.	Haeba u sa etse joalo re tla fumana tsela e 'ngoe.
He took your place.	O nkile sebaka sa hao.
I was just trying to make it go.	Ke ne ke ntse ke leka ho etsa hore e tsamaee.
They sat down to eat.	Ba ile ba lula fatše ho ja.
He had done it well.	O ne a e entse hantle.
The only thing is.	Ntho feela ke hore.
But still they will say so.	Empa leha ho le joalo ba tla bua joalo.
And do it quickly.	Mme o etse kapele.
We continued walking.	Re ile ra tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
Or anyone.	Kapa mang kapa mang.
This is not about me.	Sena ha se bue ka nna.
I was very bad.	Ke ne ke le mpe haholo.
However, it seems that they will not do so.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bonahala eka ba ke ke ba etsa joalo.
He can have it.	A ka ba le eona.
There are good things out there.	Ho na le lintho tse ntle moo.
I wanted something else.	Ke ne ke batla ho hong hape.
But no one wants him in their group.	Empa ha ho motho ea mo batlang sehlopheng sa bona.
I wish.	Ke lakatsa.
Those are powerful things.	Ke ntho tse matla tseo.
Life goes on for these people.	Bophelo bo ntse bo tsoela pele ho batho bana.
I'm starting to see it better.	Ke qala ho e bona betere.
No one heard them.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a li utloa.
He should not be alone.	Ha a lokela ho dula a le mong.
But don't tell me what to do.	Empa u se ke ua mpolella hore na u ka etsa'ng.
If so, we are done.	Haeba ho joalo, re qetile.
He wanted it for another reason.	O ne a e lakatsa ka lebaka le leng.
Well, you seem to be a.	Hantle, u bonahala eka ke a.
Fix one and the other goes.	Lokisa e 'ngoe' me e 'ngoe e ea.
And he would not know it.	Hape o ne a ke ke a e tseba.
However, we do not want all of them.	Leha ho le joalo, ha re batle kaofela ha tsona.
There was nothing wrong with them.	Ho ne ho se letho le bohloko ka bona.
It will take time to do so.	Ho tla nka nako ho etsa joalo.
I want that baby to have your name.	Ke batla hore ngoana eo a be le lebitso la hau.
Which is what they did.	E leng seo ba ileng ba se etsa.
Their parents have been devastated.	Batsoali ba bona ba utloile bohloko haholo.
He spent days traveling the area.	O ile a qeta matsatsi a tsamaea sebakeng seo.
I heard him walk away.	Ke ile ka utloa a tsamaea.
Nothing was there for a while.	Ha ho letho le neng le le teng ho feta nako e itseng.
Let me tell you something about myself.	E re ke o bolelle ho hong ka nna.
Did they meet there? 	Na ba kopane moo?
He would not let it go.	O ne a sa tlo e tlohela.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
Nice to meet you.	Ke thabela ho kopana le wena.
Take whatever you can but nothing more.	Nka eng kapa eng eo u ka e khonang empa ha ho letho le leng hape.
It seems too old.	Ho bonahala eka ke khale haholo.
He certainly does not want a date for dinner.	Ka sebele ha a batle letsatsi la lijo tsa mantsiboea.
Then we went for a drink.	Eaba re ea noa.
They are really trying.	Ba hlile ba leka.
The girl was about to cry.	Ngoanana o ne a le haufi le ho lla.
He had one too.	O ne a ena le e mong hape.
Yes, say whatever you want.	E, bua eng kapa eng eo u e batlang.
However, proceed with caution.	Leha ho le joalo, tsoela pele ka hloko.
He used to work alone, he enjoyed making friends.	O ne a tloaetse ho sebetsa a le mong, o ne a thabela ho etsa metsoalle.
It does nothing.	Ha e etse letho.
I had never heard anything like it.	Ke ne ke qala ho utloa ntho e kang eona.
It might be best to take a look.	Ho ka ba molemo hore re e'o sheba.
Don't think too much about it.	U se ke ua nahana haholo ka eona.
We made breakfast.	Re ne re etsa lijo tsa hoseng.
The girl is not like that.	Ngoanana ha a joalo.
No reason, either.	Haho lebaka, le hona.
I had to sleep.	Ke ne ke lokela ho robala.
Stay close to me.	Eba haufi le nna.
Maybe it was because it was late at night and we were tired.	Mohlomong e ne e le hobane e ne e se e le bosiu ’me re ne re khathetse.
They look like they will be fun to use.	Li shebahala eka li tla ba monate ho li sebelisa.
All week.	Ka beke kaofela.
Neither did my father.	Le Ntate ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
They both loved to sing.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba rata ho bina.
He loved to look at them.	O ne a rata ho ba sheba.
It's a wonderful night.	Ke bosiu bo monate.
Both are very good.	Ka bobeli li ntle haholo.
But no one asked him.	Empa ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a mo botsa.
It has to do some.	E tlameha ho etsa tse ling.
Obviously there is a car.	Ho hlakile hore ho na le koloi.
Love, love !!!.	Rata, rata !!!.
So, they probably don't want to live anymore.	Ka hona, e ka ’na eaba ha ba sa batla ho phela.
He was gone.	O ne a se a le sieo.
However, he did not have a team of its own.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a se na sehlopha sa eona.
You should see it here.	U lokela ho e bona mona.
Certainly not for children to eat.	Ka sebele ha se hore bana ba je.
No he is not.	Che ha a eo.
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
If it came back it would be useless.	Haeba ho ne ho ka khutla ho ne ho tla be ho se na thuso.
I thought about the passage of time.	Ke ile ka nahana ka ho feta ha nako.
You are better than this.	U molemo ho feta sena.
I wonder who we are.	Kea ipotsa hore na ke mang ho rona.
Do what you want.	Etsa seo u se batlang.
It may be best to repair a new one.	Ho ka ba molemo ho lokisa e ncha.
He went to work.	O ile a ea mosebetsing.
If he had something to say, he would say it.	Haeba a na le seo a batlang ho se bua, o ne a se bua.
He never does that.	Ha ho mohla a etsang joalo.
It's something.	Ke ntho e itseng.
He did not live with us.	Ha aa ka a phela le rona.
But you can't.	Empa u ke ke ua khona.
They want people like us.	Ba batla batho ba kang rona.
I would like you.	Nka o rata.
Mental health is a health problem.	Bothata ba kelello ke bothata ba bophelo.
The accident was real.	Kotsi e bile ea sebele.
They continue to work hard at it.	Ba tsoela pele ho sebetsa ka thata ho eona.
There is nothing else you can talk about.	Ha ho letho le leng leo u ka buang ka lona.
It's hard to make friends.	Ho thata ho etsa metsoalle.
It is very important.	E bohlokoa haholo.
You work hard.	U sebetsa ka thata.
For me, this was always a problem.	Ho ’na, sena e ne e lula e le bothata.
He loved the party.	O ne a rata mokete.
I really like it.	Ke hlile kea e rata.
I was in a group.	Ke ne ke le sehlopheng.
I have always loved her.	Haesale ke mo rata.
He would finish his work first.	O ne a tla qeta mosebetsi oa hae pele.
Children do not like to swim.	Bana ha ba rate ho sesa.
He finally reached his bedroom.	Qetellong a fihla kamoreng ea hae ea ho robala.
Now, we can play.	Joale, re ka bapala.
Where he knew he was.	Moo a neng a tseba hore o teng.
But it was too soon for that.	Empa e ne e le kapele haholo bakeng sa seo.
No he is not.	Che ha a eo.
It works for everyone.	E sebetsa ho bohle.
I hoped they were working on whatever it was.	Ke ne ke tšepa hore ba ne ba sebetsa ho eng kapa eng eo e neng e le eona.
If it is too good to be true, it probably is.	Haeba e le ntle haholo hore e ka ba 'nete, ho ka etsahala hore ebe ho joalo.
We need a way to fix this.	Re hloka mokhoa oa ho lokisa taba ena.
There was a chance.	Ho ne ho e-na le monyetla.
He said he was sorry.	E re o ne a masoabi.
I go to look.	Ke tsamaea ho ea sheba.
But we must do this.	Empa re lokela ho etsa sena.
Of course, you can use such a thing only once.	Ehlile, o ka sebelisa ntho e joalo hang feela.
The party must decide.	Mokete o tlameha ho etsa qeto.
We can do that at any time.	Re ka etsa seo ka nako leha e le efe.
He seemed to be having a hard night.	O ne a bonahala eka o bile le bosiu bo boima.
It can't happen.	E ke ke ea etsahala.
My parents know us well.	Batsoali ba ka ba re tseba ka bobeli hantle.
So there we were, going forward, only.	Kahoo re ne re le teng, re ea pele, feela.
His parents were hard on him as a child.	Batsoali ba hae ba ne ba le thata ho eena ha e sa le ngoana.
They have been around for many years.	Ba bile teng ka lilemo tse ngata.
I can understand everyone.	Ke khona ho utloisisa bohle.
See you next time !.	Ke tla u bona nakong e tlang!.
However you did not.	Leha ho le joalo ha ua ka ua etsa joalo.
They said they had never seen it.	Ba itse ha ba eso o bone.
This is his truth.	Sena ke 'nete ea hae.
I mean, look at that thing !.	Ke bolela, sheba ntho eo!.
Now, we do.	Jwale, re etsa jwalo.
Whatever was going on was something else.	Eng kapa eng e neng e etsahala e ne e le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I am very happy for such people.	Ke thabile haholo batho ba joalo.
And then you go do that.	Mme ebe o ya etsa seo.
He refused to help.	O ile a hana ho thusa.
I just quit.	Ke sa tsoa tlohela.
I can't do it.	Ha ke khone ho e etsa.
We thought so, though.	Re ne re nahana joalo, leha ho le joalo.
Here, last night, in my bedroom.	Mona, maobane bosiu, ka phaposing ya ka ya ho robala.
It's harder than that.	Ho thata ho feta.
For most people, it is not their business.	Ho batho ba bangata, ha se taba ea bona.
Your job is to make it easy.	Mosebetsi oa hau ke ho etsa hore ho be bonolo.
I could not care for the children.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho hlokomela bana.
Enter the room.	Kena ka phaposing.
Someone nearby is crying.	Motho e mong ea haufi o ntse a lla.
I'm out of space.	Ke tsoa sebakeng.
Life is Beautiful!.	Bophelo bo monate!.
What are we talking about?	Re ntse re bua ka eng?
I mean it's just the sun.	Ke bolela hore ke letsatsi feela.
I find it not easy.	Ke fumana hore ha ho bonolo.
He spoke alone.	O ne a bua a le mong.
But the real problem is very serious.	Empa bothata ba sebele bo boima haholo.
You are not sure why you say no.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng ha u re ha ho joalo.
I should not use it.	Ha kea lokela ho e sebelisa.
Probably not.	Mohlomong o ne a se joalo.
Here he was happy.	Mona o ne a thabile.
That's what it's about.	Ke seo e buang ka sona.
After about three hours, we arrive.	Ka mor'a lihora tse ka bang tharo, rea fihla.
Down.	Fatše.
I was one of the last to come out.	Ke bile e mong oa ba ho qetela ho tsoa.
That means we will need help.	Seo se bolela hore re tla hloka thuso.
He just used it.	O ile a e sebelisa feela.
We are one.	Re bang.
That is what the law did for him.	Ke sona seo molao o ileng oa mo etsetsa sona.
However, he did not make that mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, ha aa ka a etsa phoso eo.
There is a significance to that.	Ho na le bohlokoa ho seo.
However, he could not play outside.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa khone ho bapala ka ntle.
I still do not understand what happened.	Ke ntse ke sa utloisise se etsahetseng.
We may have trouble finding it.	Re ka ba le bothata ba ho o fumana.
He just starts.	O qala feela.
You have to think a lot.	U tlameha ho nahana haholo.
It is my head and my belly.	Ke hlooho ea ka le mpa ea ka.
I hope they will help you too.	Ke tšepa hore le uena ba tla u thusa.
Trying to find a reason.	Ho leka ho fumana lebaka.
Take her now.	Mo nke jwale.
No problems.	Ha ho na mathata.
I just wanted him to know he knew.	Ke ne ke batla feela hore a tsebe hore oa tseba.
He knows that very well.	O tseba seo hantle.
Of course, nothing.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho letho.
Or I meant it, though.	Kapa ke ne ke e bolela, leha ho le joalo.
We need to make these things work.	Re hloka ho etsa hore lintho tsena li tsamaee.
Really fun.	Ka sebele e monate haholo.
You will do the same again.	U tla etsa joalo hape.
I have no idea.	Ha ke na maikutlo .
Sometimes, you may not even know it exists.	Ka linako tse ling, u ke ke ua tseba le hore e teng.
I too stood there and said nothing.	Le ’na ke ile ka ema moo eaba ha kea ka ka bua letho.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
I just hope he can make a lot of money soon.	Ke tšepa feela hore a ka etsa chelete e ngata haufinyane.
He wished he had never come.	O ne a lakatsa eka a ka be a sa tla.
They were passing by.	Ba ne ba feta moo.
It is not easy.	Ha ho bonolo.
I could not do anything at the time.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho etsa letho ka nako eo.
Probably too much.	Mohlomong e ngata haholo.
He did not look at her, nor did he hear what she was saying.	Ha aa ka a mo sheba, kapa a utloa seo a se buang.
The baby was crying a lot.	Ngoana o ne a lla haholo.
Anyway, very early.	Joalo, hoseng haholo.
He must have been like that, like me, for about three years.	E tlameha ebe o ne a le joalo, joalo ka 'na, hoo e ka bang lilemo tse tharo.
That's their fault, isn't it?	Ke phoso ya bona eo, na haho jwalo?
It's really hard.	Ehlile ho thata.
I really didn't know what to do with myself.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa tsebe hore na ke etse eng ka 'na.
But this is my money we are talking about.	Empa ena ke chelete ea ka eo re buang ka eona.
You have to look at people.	O lokela ho sheba batho.
I heard close.	Ke utloile haufi.
I would rather stay at home than go.	Nka mpa ka dula hae ho ena le ho ya.
But they know that he is alive.	Empa baa tseba hore oa phela.
That must have been fun.	E tlameha ebe seo se ne se le monate.
You do not understand anything.	Ha u utloisise letho.
I could be more, to be better.	Nka ba ho feta, ho ba betere.
Use with caution.	Sebelisa ka hloko.
But there really was no time for that.	Empa ha e le hantle ho ne ho se nako ea seo.
I did not know where he was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe moo a leng teng.
He is very strong.	O matla haholo.
People are starting to know who you are.	Batho ba qala ho tseba hore na u mang.
Parents feel helpless.	Batsoali ba ikutloa ba se na thuso.
Once we start, we will have to go very fast.	Hang ha re qala, re tla tlameha ho tsamaea kapele haholo.
There will be no problems.	Ho ke ke ha e-ba le mathata.
He may have been present.	E ka 'na eaba o ne a le teng.
This was really just the first case.	Sena ehlile e ne e le boemo ba pele feela.
It's easy to do.	Ho bonolo ho e etsa.
If you do not do one you are doing another.	Haeba u sa etse e 'ngoe u etsa e' ngoe.
The only problem is how to do it.	Bothata feela ke mokhoa oa ho e etsa.
I hope you get the idea.	Kea tšepa u tla fumana mohopolo.
I have been doing this for a long time.	Ke khale ke etsa sena.
We need it.	Rea e hloka.
If only it were that easy.	Hoja feela ho ne ho le bonolo hakaalo.
Ho.	Ho.
So, the problem is still there.	Ka hona, bothata bo ntse bo le teng.
He agreed to attend.	O ile a lumela ho ba teng.
I am studying this book.	Ke ntse ke ithuta buka ena.
Someone coming this way.	Motho ya tlang ka tsela ena.
He will give you exactly what you need.	O tla o fa hantle seo o se hlokang.
It was not important at all.	E ne e se ba bohlokoa ho hang.
It was fun, surprisingly fun.	E ne e le monate, ka tsela e makatsang.
After all, it is not.	Ka mor'a moo, ha ho joalo.
Once you do them you will never understand why you can’t.	Hang ha u ka li etsa u ke ke ua utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha u sa khone.
Almost everyone rode fast.	Hoo e ka bang bohle ba ile ba palama kapele.
I can only talk about them.	Nka bua feela ka tsona.
I had no idea.	Ke ne ke sa nahane ka letho.
It was as if he were reading my mind.	E ne eka o bala kelello ea ka.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
You wanted to be with him.	U ne u batla ho ba le eena.
I was done.	Ke ne ke qetile.
They are still going to happen.	Li ntse li tla etsahala.
I love you more than you will understand.	Ke u rata ho feta kamoo u tla utloisisa.
I think they are wrong.	Ke nahana hore ba phoso.
Everything was fine with me.	Tsohle li ne li le ntle ka 'na.
No one really knows how they work, or why.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle hore na li sebetsa joang, kapa hobaneng.
Now, people forget this.	Jwale, batho ba lebala sena.
I don't think she wants to go home !.	Ha ke nahane hore e batla ho ea hae!.
It can be fun.	Ho ka ba monate.
They think you are better.	Ba nahana hore o betere.
We are no longer here.	Ha re sa le ba mona.
He loves you.	O a o rata.
I do not like to plan.	Ha ke rate ho rera.
He finished everyone.	O ile a qeta e mong le e mong.
He knows nothing about modern life.	Ha a tsebe letho ka bophelo ba kajeno.
I'm glad you decided to take that opportunity.	Ke thabetse hore ebe u nkile qeto ea ho nka monyetla oo.
Other than that, there is nothing.	Ntle ho moo, ha ho na letho.
Hard as it is, they have to keep going.	Leha ho le thata, ba tlameha ho tsoela pele.
I think he is, a little bit.	Ke nahana hore o teng, hanyane.
I need to be with you.	Ke hloka ho ba le uena.
I needed to feel it.	Ke ne ke hloka ho ikutloa.
Not good.	Ha e ntle.
My life is not in danger.	Bophelo ba ka ha bo kotsing.
I loved my parents.	Ke ne ke rata batsoali ba ka.
I have always loved my mother.	Haesale ke rata mme wa ka.
I love it, and thank you !!!!.	Kea e rata, 'me kea leboha !!!!.
Probably.	Mohlomong.
Who he was.	E ne e le mang.
So, we use their method.	Ka hona, re sebelisa mokhoa oa bona.
The process is not like that.	Mokhoa ha o joalo.
It would have been difficult.	Ho ka be ho bile thata.
He looked at them.	A ba sheba.
It was better this way, he thought.	Ho ne ho le betere ka tsela ena, a nahana.
We all had a great time!	Kaofela re bile le nako e monate!
I can tell you whatever it is.	Nka u bolella eng kapa eng eo e leng eona.
The work will still be there.	Mosebetsi o ntse o tla ba teng.
Where did he go?	O ile kae?
Good on what he did.	E ntle le ho seo a se entseng.
Moreover, this group has many people behind it.	Ho feta moo, sehlopha sena se na le batho ba bangata ka mor'a sona.
They were waiting for his return.	Ba ne ba emetse ho khutla ha hae.
However, it is still ongoing.	Leha ho le joalo, e ntse e tsoela pele.
It still exists.	E ntse e le teng.
I can't find him or her.	Ha ke mo fumane kapa eena.
There were us and them.	Ho ne ho ena le rona le bona.
Maybe you can talk to him.	Mohlomong u ka bua le eena.
I have never been a man or a father very much.	Ha ke so ka ka ba monna kapa ntate haholo.
Of course he was.	Ehlile o ne a le jwalo.
She took her husband's name.	O nkile lebitso la monna wa hae.
He didn't even need to try.	O ne a sa hloke le ho leka.
Please, go now.	Ka kopo, tsamaea joale.
He likes a lot of things.	O rata lintho tse ngata.
It's really weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang ruri.
I was strong.	Ke ne ke le matla.
It is not necessary.	Ha se hakaalo.
Obviously, he knew where they were.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a tseba moo ba leng teng.
My mom told me last year.	'M'e oa ka o ile a mpolella selemong se fetileng.
This one looked like the first one.	Ena e ne e shebahala joaloka ea pele.
I'll get back to you in a few hours.	Ke tla khutlela ho uena ka mor'a lihora tse seng kae.
I really like the idea.	Ke hlile ke rata mohopolo.
But they can do it.	Empa ba ka e etsa.
Before we meet.	Pele re kopana.
I don't want you to think a little about me.	Ha ke batle hore o nahane hanyane ka nna.
Yet it seems to be the case.	Leha ho le joalo ho bonahala ho le joalo.
You wouldn’t believe he just wanted to see what it was like.	U ne u ke ke ua lumela hore o ne a batla feela ho bona hore na ho joang.
I hope he will continue to do so.	Ke tšepa hore o tla tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
This will not happen.	Sena se ka se be teng.
By then he was no longer able to eat.	Ka nako eo o ne a se a sa khone ho ja.
Individual group.	Sehlopha sa motho ka mong.
My husband had never told me anything about it.	Monna oa ka o ne a e-s'o ka a mpolella letho ka taba eo.
Let's take a chance.	Ha re nke monyetla.
Finally, she cried.	Qetellong, o ile a lla.
He felt there was something wrong.	O ile a utloa hore ho na le phoso.
All the other children had to play.	Bana ba bang kaofela ba ile ba tlameha ho bapala.
I mean if he didn’t, it was kind of dangerous.	Ke bolela hore haeba a sa ka a etsa joalo, e ne e le mofuta oa kotsi.
I can see him then very well.	Ke mo bona ka nako eo hantle.
You certainly know.	Ka sebele ua tseba.
I am very happy about this.	Ke thabile haholo ka sena.
I think that's a bad thing.	Ke nahana hore ke ntho e mpe.
I was here before, in my first week, and got nothing.	Ke ne ke le mona pele, bekeng ea ka ea pele, 'me ke sa fumane letho.
Error not met.	Phoso ha e kopane.
Delicious food, too.	Lijo tse monate, hape.
He opened the door again.	A bula lemati hape.
I'm not exactly sure.	Ha ke na bonnete hantle.
Family only this year.	Lelapa feela selemong sena.
But we must take them together.	Empa re lokela ho li nka hammoho.
There is no room.	Haho sebaka.
Do what you love, and do it often.	Etsa seo u se ratang, 'me u se etse hangata.
He was a little older than I was.	O ne a mpheta hanyane.
She says her son is better now.	O re mora oa hae o betere hona joale.
But it would need to be said, even more so.	Empa ho ne ho tla hloka ho bua, le ho feta.
Just by looking.	Ka ho sheba feela.
The rest are gone.	Ba bang kaofela ba tsamaea.
I do not understand it.	Ha ke e utloisise.
Me and you, it can still happen.	Nna le wena, e ntse e ka etsahala.
The decision is final.	Qeto ke ea ho qetela.
Do your job as you can.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau joalo ka ha u ka tsamaea.
He keeps us happy.	O re boloka re thabile.
Everyone could hear it.	E mong le e mong o ne a ka e utloa.
But there is nothing here but my name.	Empa ha ho letho ho ena ntle le lebitso la ka.
It's been too long.	E se e le nako e telele haholo.
I read books.	Ke bala libuka.
There was nothing at all.	Ho ne ho se na letho ho hang.
Otherwise, you will want.	Ntle ho moo, u tla batla.
He had to see.	O ne a lokela ho bona.
Let him take his place.	A nke sebaka sa hae.
He could not care less after that.	O ne a ka be a sa tsotelle letho ka mora moo.
Every time we see them we cry.	Nako le nako ha re ba bona rea ​​lla.
I have to meet my friends.	Ke tlameha ho kopana le metsoalle ea ka.
You have all the rest.	U na le tse ling kaofela.
They did nothing.	Ba ne ba sa etsa letho.
It can be the same here.	Ho ka ba joalo le mona.
These books are useless!	Libuka tsena ha li na thuso!
The only way out of the area.	Tsela feela ea ho tsoa sebakeng.
He once told me that it would not be a problem.	O ile a mpolella ka nako e 'ngoe hore e ke ke ea e-ba bothata.
You must live in the present.	O tlameha ho phela nakong ya jwale.
Everyone wants to feel good.	E mong le e mong o batla ho ikutloa hantle.
I betray my wife and my family.	Ke eka mosali oa ka le lelapa la ka.
Water is certainly an important factor here.	Ka sebele metsi ke ntho ea bohlokoa mona.
And be with you.	Mme ke be le wena.
There may be some opportunity there.	Ho ka ba le monyetla o itseng moo.
However, people have a good idea.	Leha ho le joalo, batho ba na le mohopolo o motle.
I want people to like it.	Ke batla hore batho ba e rate.
Of course, this is not the case.	Ha e le hantle, sena ha se joalo.
I do not know where to start.	Ha ke tsebe ho qala.
Like many.	Joalo ka tse ngata.
There I am, and there you are.	Nna ke eo, le wena ke eo.
You need to know that too.	O lokela ho tseba seo le wena.
She must try to think like her mother.	O tlameha ho leka ho nahana joaloka 'mè oa hae.
He started writing.	A qala ho ngola.
However, this is a real question.	Leha ho le joalo, ena ke potso ea 'nete.
That too is very important.	Seo le sona se bohlokoa haholo.
He was sure he had seen this before.	O ne a na le bonnete ba hore o kile a bona sena pele.
Second, you must love it.	Ea bobeli, u tlameha ho e rata.
Mine will not exist.	Ea ka e ke ke ea ba teng.
I really like you.	Ruri kea o rata.
As he drove, he kept thinking about his condition.	Ha a ntse a khanna, o ne a nahana ka boemo ba hae.
Here is the thought.	Mona ke mohopolo.
He has to go to work every day.	O tlameha ho ea mosebetsing letsatsi le leng le le leng.
The food is very tasty.	Lijo li monate haholo.
It would be difficult.	E ne e tla ba thata.
Of course, he could not just quit.	Ehlile, o ne a ke ke a tlohela feela.
Like, they don't exist.	Joaloka, ha li eo.
Probably because he didn't care.	Mohlomong hobane o ne a sa tsotelle.
I don’t know if he was there or not.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o ne a le teng kapa che.
You have to learn.	O lokela ho ithuta.
Of course now.	Leha e le hantle hona joale.
Maybe combined.	Mohlomong e kopane.
He wanted that life.	O ne a batla bophelo boo.
Forget it all in advance, just start something new.	Lebala tsohle esale pele, qala feela ntho e ncha.
I still have to work.	Ke ntse ke tlameha ho sebetsa.
There is a problem.	Ho na le bothata.
So he works while he is in school.	Kahoo o sebetsa ha a ntse a kena sekolo.
They are the ones who are coming.	Ke ba bona ba tla.
Until he wants them to know who he is.	Ho fihlela a batla hore ba tsebe hore na ke mang.
Not liking to eat alone.	Ho se rate ho ja o le mong.
Or they did not believe him.	Kapa ha baa ka ba mo lumela.
I did not finish it.	Ha kea e qeta.
Of course, look at this.	Ha e le hantle, sheba sena.
Every girl will want to be her own.	Ngoanana e mong le e mong o tla batla ho ba eena.
It must be difficult to live with your doctor.	Ho tlameha ho ba thata ho phela le ngaka ea hau.
I do not know from whom.	Ha ke tsebe ho tsoa ho mang.
I looked at him.	Ke ile ka mo sheba.
I know, but.	Kea tseba, empa .
I will definitely try this.	Ka sebele ke tla leka sena.
He can do strange things.	A ka etsa lintho tse makatsang.
The place was empty.	Sebaka seo se ne se se na letho.
He was a family man.	E ne e le monna oa lelapa.
And to live.	Le ho phela.
It can't happen.	E ke ke ea etsahala.
I do not want to go.	ha ke batle ho tsamaea.
It was coming from the outside.	E ne e tsoa ka ntle.
The memory is still unthinkable.	Mohopolo o ntse o sa nahane.
I didn't know that, either.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe seo, le nna.
She loves it.	O a e rata.
You know, I'm real.	O ya tseba, nna wa sebele.
Many people seem to visit every day.	Ho bonahala batho ba bangata ba ntse ba etela letsatsi le leng le le leng.
Her parents agreed to let her leave school.	Batsoali ba hae ba ile ba lumela ho mo lumella ho tlohela sekolo.
Yet they will have it.	Leha ho le joalo ba tla ba le eona.
But more than that, more than that.	Empa ho feta moo, ho feta moo.
That is the hardest part.	Ke eona ntho e thata haholo.
But now, he did not have to.	Empa joale, o ne a sa tlameha.
I love getting them.	Ke rata ho li fumana.
See if any of these help.	Bona hore na e 'ngoe ea tsena e thusa.
How he wanted her.	Kamoo a neng a mo batla kateng.
Here it is.	Ke ena.
It was a wonderful time.	E bile le nako e monate.
He decided that he would pay her back.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore o tla mo lefa.
I don't know what that would be.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hoo e ne e tla ba eng.
He will be a doctor.	E tlo ba ngaka.
He usually drinks water before eating.	Hangata o noa metsi pele a ja.
Because we actually use them every day.	Hobane re hlile re li sebelisa letsatsi le letsatsi.
So far everything is working fine.	Ho fihlela joale tsohle li sebetsa hantle.
I will not.	Nke ke ka etsa joalo.
I am leaving tomorrow.	Ke tla tsamaea hosane.
He is right.	O bolela hantle.
She was crying when she got home.	O ne a ntse a lla ho fihla hae.
Everything was still looking good.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e ntse e shebahala hantle.
It seemed too much.	E ne e bonahala e le ngata haholo.
He tried to say something.	A leka ho bua ho hong.
This is very close to that.	Sena se haufi hantle le seo.
He knew better now.	O ne a tseba ho feta jwale.
His life was lonely.	Bophelo ba hae e ne e le ba bolutu.
Many did not care.	Ba bangata ba ne ba sa tsotelle.
There was no reason to believe it.	Ho ne ho se na lebaka la ho e lumela.
Maybe we should call him.	Mohlomong re lokela ho mo letsetsa.
But there is more going on.	Empa ho na le lintho tse ling tse ngata tse etsahalang.
Until then, always.	Ho fihlela ka nako eo, ka linako tsohle.
You can never.	Le ka mohla u ke ke ua.
And that's what you're going to get.	Mme ke seo o tlang ho se fumana.
This road is dangerous.	Tsela ena e kotsi.
Do not have a problem with them.	Se be le bothata le bona.
I really do not know this place.	Ruri ha ke tsebe sebaka sena.
But only you can do it.	Empa ke uena feela ea ka e etsang.
He had trouble sleeping that night.	O ile a ba le bothata ba ho robala bosiung boo.
His wife is even worse.	Mosali oa hae o mpe le ho feta.
I strongly believe.	Ke lumela haholo.
It’s almost enough, though.	E batla e lekana, leha ho le joalo.
There was no need to win.	Ho ne ho sa hloke le ho hlola.
In another.	Ho e 'ngoe.
If the pain persists, see a doctor.	Haeba bohloko bo ntse bo tsoela pele, bona ngaka.
He had met someone.	O ne a kopane le motho.
Go ahead and see what they enjoy about their work.	Tsoela pele 'me u bone hore na ba thabela eng ka mosebetsi oa bona.
I'm sorry to say that.	Ke masoabi ho bua joalo.
Make life worthwhile and worthwhile.	Etsa hore bophelo e be ba bohlokoa 'me e be ba bohlokoa.
Or their children.	Kapa bana ba bona.
That was a difficult subject.	Eo e ne e le taba e thata.
She did not cry anymore.	Ha a ka a hlola a lla.
Your doctor is useless!	Ngaka ea hau ha e na thuso ho hang!
For a good presence or something.	Bakeng sa ho ba teng hantle kapa ntho e itseng.
I'm tired of it.	Ke khathetse ke eona.
Sitting down for a long time now.	Ho lula fatše nako e telele hona joale.
He tried to figure out where he could be.	A leka ho nahana moo a ka bang teng.
I really was.	Ke ne ke hlile ke le joalo.
He did so.	O entse jwalo.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho joalo.
But you can't.	Empa u ke ke ua khona.
This can take up to three days.	Sena se ka nka matsatsi a mararo.
Just want to believe they know better.	Feela batla ho lumela hore ba tseba betere.
Some are powerful.	Ba bang ba matla.
I'm not going to sleep tonight, he thought.	Ha ke sa tla robala bosiung bona, a nahana.
Can't you see what is happening there?	Na ha o bone se etsahalang moo?
Then second.	Ebe oa bobeli.
She realized that her father loved her.	O ile a hlokomela hore ntate oa hae oa mo rata.
It was too fast.	E ne e le kapele haholo.
We work well.	Re sebetsa hantle.
Maybe he would read.	Mohlomong o ne a tla bala.
We'll see next year.	Re tla bona selemong se tlang.
But it was not there.	Empa e ne e le sieo.
Maybe it was the situation.	Mohlomong e ne e le boemo.
It's all for the best.	Ke tsohle bakeng sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
But you see, it is important.	Empa ua bona, e bohlokoa.
No, it is not old.	Che, ha se ea khale.
We will not be able to do it.	Re ke ke ra khona ho e etsa.
That was certainly difficult.	Ruri seo se ne se le thata.
I had never seen anything like it.	Ke ne ke qala ho bona ntho e joalo.
You know, they're doing a lot of things now.	Ua tseba, ba ntse ba etsa lintho tse ngata hona joale.
She sings beautifully.	O bina ha monate.
I worked hard.	Ke ne ke sebetsa ka thata.
For most people it is difficult.	Batho ba bangata ho thata.
In fact, they have nothing in common.	Ha e le hantle, ha ba na letho leo ba tšoanang ka lona.
He had to stop.	O ile a tlameha ho ema.
This really works.	Sena se hlile se sebetsa.
But it was not a car.	Empa e ne e se koloi.
Saying what I want to say.	Ho bua seo ke batlang ho se bua.
I want to give it my all.	Ke batla ho o fa kaofela ha ka.
I have news.	Ke na le litaba.
But this is not a question.	Empa sena ha se potso.
We are not going to look for breakfast.	Ha re e'o batla lijo tsa hoseng.
I can find a place here.	Nka fumana sebaka mona.
We did this last year.	Re entse sena le selemong se fetileng.
He cannot live without her.	A ke ke a phela ntle le eena.
I had never seen anyone play that way.	Ke ne ke e-s'o bone motho a bapala ka tsela eo.
This is difficult for most of us to understand.	Sena se thata ho ba bangata ba rona ho se utloisisa.
He told her a little about his family.	O ile a mo bolella ho se hokae ka lelapa la hae.
I can't see it very well.	Ha ke e bone hantle.
I'm not on the phone right now.	Ha ke haufi le mohala hona joale.
So far, she has not had to pay.	Ho fihlela joale, ha a e-so tlameha ho lefa.
I did not expect them to be so bad.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore ba ka ba mpe hakaalo.
It should not be visible.	E lokela ho se bonahale.
It is very difficult to understand.	Ho thata haholo ho utloisisa.
He did not even want to be around them.	O ne a sa batle le ho ba haufi le bona.
I understand it up to that point.	Ke e utloisisa ho fihlela moo.
We must help him.	Re tlameha ho mo thusa.
Everyone understood the reason.	E mong le e mong o ne a utloisisa lebaka.
That's what everyone was always saying.	Ke seo bohle ba neng ba se bua kamehla.
Of the thing.	Ea ntho.
We enjoyed a very nice dinner.	Re ile ra thabela lijo tsa mantsiboea tse monate haholo.
It's been my whole life.	E bile bophelo bohle ba ka.
They could not expect more.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba lebella tse ngata.
He sat down and fell asleep.	O ile a lula fatše 'me a robala.
Nice day for a long walk.	Letsatsi le monate bakeng sa ho tsamaea nako e telele.
This place has amazing power.	Sebaka sena se na le matla a makatsang.
I just have to find out what’s going on.	Ke tlameha feela ho fumana hore na ho etsahalang.
He does not like anyone.	Ha a rate motho.
I went to his high school.	Ke ile ka ea sekolong sa hae sa sekolo se phahameng.
I don't want to live that way.	Ha ke batle ho phela ka tsela eo.
He is waiting for his return.	O emetse ho khutla ha hae.
You both make me think.	Ka bobeli le etsa hore ke nahane.
You know how things go.	Ua tseba hore na lintho tseo li tsamaea joang.
The rest.	Ba bang kaofela.
Then everything should work.	Ebe tsohle li lokela ho sebetsa.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
And we can talk.	Mme re ka bua.
It is never easy.	Ha ho mohla ho leng bonolo.
That he wanted to live again.	Hore o ne a batla ho phela hape.
Man, however, is also legal.	Motho, leha ho le joalo, le ka molao.
I do not know what to think.	Ha ke tsebe seo nka se nahanang ka sona.
Nothing has worked before.	Ha ho letho le kileng la sebetsa pele.
I did the same.	Le ’na ke ile ka etsa joalo.
Our image is everything.	Setšoantšo sa rona ke ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
One can only wonder the danger of walking here.	Motho a ka ipotsa feela kotsi ea ho tsamaea mona.
We just caught him.	Re sa tsoa mo tšoara.
I have never done that, and I never will.	Ha ke e-s'o ka ke etsa joalo, 'me le ka mohla nke ke ka etsa joalo.
These may seem premature.	Tsena li ka 'na tsa bonahala li sa le pele.
So he did not have it.	Kahoo o ne a se na eona.
They should talk about it and talk about it.	Ba lokela ho bua ka eona le ho bua ka eona.
These people.	Batho bana.
Probably not.	Mohlomong o ne a sa ka a etsa joalo.
The head helps you think clearly.	Hlooho ho u thusa ho nahana hantle.
I did nothing there.	Ha kea ka ka etsa letho moo.
And we can look at that.	Mme re ka sheba seo.
I need to tell you again.	Ke hloka ho o bolella hape.
I should not have made it a point.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho e etsa tlhahiso.
I am no longer here.	Ha ke sa le teng hona joale.
I'm not sure how to operate it.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka e sebetsa joang.
But if he did not.	Empa haeba a sa ka a etsa joalo.
You seem to be thinking about us	Ho bonahala u ntse u nahana ka rona
I was working mentally.	Ke ne ke sebetsa ka mohopolo.
It was so beautiful.	E ne e le ntle haholo.
I've never seen it.	Ha ke eso e bone.
However, that is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo haholo.
You are sure that one day you will win.	U na le bonnete ba hore ka letsatsi le leng u tla hlola.
Yesterday was a wonderful day.	Maobane e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
I don’t know how it works, but it works.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e sebetsa joang, empa ea sebetsa.
He could hear her just talking.	O ne a utloa ha a bua feela.
I do not know who you are.	Ha ke tsebe hore na u mang.
It's not just talking here.	Ha se ho bua feela mona.
It seems to be missing.	E bonahala e le sieo.
However, it should not be this way.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ea lokela ho ba ka tsela ena.
It works here today.	E sebetsa mona kajeno.
And it just started from there.	Mme ya qala feela ho tloha moo.
He loved his job.	O ne a rata mosebetsi oa hae.
Will you ask mom?	O tla botsa mme?
And then there was nothing more.	'Me joale ho ne ho se letho hape.
Come home soon.	Tlo hae kapele.
I will not need a car.	Nke ke ka hloka koloi.
The work kept me busy.	Mosebetsi o ne o etsa hore ke phathahane.
They do not say.	Ha ba re.
It's easy to wear.	Ho bonolo ho apara.
This helped a lot.	Sena se ile sa thusa haholo.
Every time you had something you would have to give it away.	Nako le nako ha u na le ntho u ne u tla tlameha ho fana ka eona.
Everyone knows them.	E mong le e mong oa li tseba.
You can do this ahead of time.	U ka etsa sena pele ho nako.
But this seems like an easy thing to fix.	Empa sena se bonahala e le ntho e bonolo ho e lokisa.
Things are much simpler now.	Lintho li bonolo haholo hona joale.
I thought we would never get here.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re ke ke ra fihla mona.
He wanted to forget about it all.	O ne a batla ho lebala ka eona kaofela.
This is for you.	Ena ke ea hau.
I would love to read them.	Nka thabela ho li bala.
You have your friends.	U na le metsoalle ea hau.
Well, of course, of course.	Hantle, ha e le hantle, ehlile.
It can't be too bad.	E ka se be mpe haholo.
He tried to find it, but always made a mistake.	O ile a leka ho e fumana, empa joalo ka kamehla a etsa phoso.
Maybe he had it.	Mohlomong o ne a e-na le eona.
I hope this is what you want.	Ke tšepa hore sena ke seo u se batlang.
And I did just that on the job.	'Me ke entse joalo ka mosebetsi.
These look great.	Tsena li shebahala li le ntle.
I like it better when people do that.	Ke e rata betere ha batho ba etsa joalo.
My father came into the room.	Ntate a kena ka phaposing.
They take a week or more.	Li nka beke kapa ho feta.
They could have been arrested.	Ba ka be ba ile ba tšoaroa.
Talking about it is easy.	Ho bua ka eona ho bonolo.
His favorite time was reading.	Nako eo a neng a e rata haholo e ne e le ho bala.
They just do nothing.	Ba mpa ba sa etse letho.
It’s something from me.	Ke ntho ea ho tloha ho 'na.
But it was nothing.	Empa ho ne ho se letho.
I can't sleep because of it.	Ha ke khone ho robala ka lebaka la eona.
He had a lot of things, before that.	O ne a e-na le lintho tse ngata, pele ho moo.
And it still does today.	Mme e sa le teng ho fihlela kajeno.
I can live anywhere.	Nka lula kae kapa kae.
I can say that.	Nka bolela hakaalo.
It would be strange for most people.	E ka ba ntho e makatsang ho batho ba bangata.
He was there to help her.	O ne a le teng ho mo thusa.
No, he would not.	Che, o ne a ke ke a etsa joalo.
Yes, more than that, please.	E, ho feta mona, ka kopo.
No one wanted to know anything.	Ho ne ho se motho ea batlang ho tseba letho.
I will wait for you.	Ke tla u emetse.
However, I have something I want to do.	Leha ho le joalo, ke na le seo ke batlang ho se etsa.
He does it because he loves it.	O e etsa hobane a e rata.
You made a mistake, you know!	U entse phoso, ua tseba!
What it was, is good.	Seo e neng e le sona, se molemo.
He did just that.	O ile a etsa joalo.
She is so beautiful and so beautiful.	O motle haholo mme o motle haholo.
They will not arrive on time.	Ba ke ke ba fihla ka nako.
I do not want anyone to know.	Ha ke batle hore mang kapa mang a tsebe.
Too much later than ever.	Ho ba morao haholo ho feta neng kapa neng.
It's pretty clear.	Ho hlakile hantle.
However, that would not be the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
Go right back.	Khutlela morao hantle.
I am a dog.	Ke ntja.
He had to be.	O ne a lokela ho ba jwalo.
For the situation you are in.	Bakeng sa boemo boo o leng ho bona.
The baby cried.	Ngoana a lla.
He did a great job.	O entse mosebetsi o moholo.
But he did play a second time before.	Empa o kile a bapala la bobeli pele.
We know it now.	Re a e tseba jwale.
I have no feelings for him in any way.	Ha ke na maikutlo ho eena ka tsela e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe.
I just thought what I could ask him.	Ke ile ka nahana feela hore na nka mo botsa eng.
Then, it was her night.	Joale, e ne e le bosiu ba hae.
, if necessary.	, ha ho hlokahala.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke na bonnete.
But, there is something wrong with this.	Empa, ho na le phoso ho sena.
The boy opened the back door.	Moshanyana a bula lemati le ka morao.
It's hard to find a real picture.	Ho thata ho fumana setšoantšo sa sebele.
We really like the place.	Re hlile re rata sebaka seo.
I don't think it's good.	Ha ke nahane hore e ntle.
But he could not find his way.	Empa o ne a sa khone ho ba le tsela ea hae.
I had never done this before and it was so much fun.	Ha ke e-s'o ka ke etsa sena pele 'me e ne e le monate haholo.
I didn't even know it was coming.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe le hore e tla tla.
Friends know these things about each other.	Metsoalle e tseba lintho tsena ka e mong.
I am sure it will appear.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore e tla bonahala.
So he probably never saw anything.	Kahoo mohlomong o ne a eso bone letho.
It was easy.	Ho ne ho le bonolo.
It was good but it could have been better.	E ne e le ntle empa e ka be e bile betere.
He tends to work hard.	O tloaetse ho sebetsa ka thata.
He certainly was not here.	Ka sebele e ne e le sieo mona.
Everyone is.	E mong le e mong eena.
Another letter fell.	Lengolo le leng le ile la oa.
At the end of things.	Qetellong ea lintho.
No, there is no such thing.	Che, ha ho letho le joalo.
When he feels better it is time enough.	Ha a ikutloa a le betere ke nako e lekaneng.
You have to know where it is.	O tlameha ho tseba moo e leng teng.
I have to go and get help.	Ke tlameha ho ea batla thuso.
Mine is not as good as it always is.	Ea ka ha e ntle joalo ka linako tsohle.
Some people may not like it.	Batho ba bang ba ke ke ba e rata.
He tried to speak again very quickly.	A leka ho bua hape kapele haholo.
And they have other things to do.	'Me ba na le lintho tse ling tseo ba lokelang ho li etsa.
It doesn't have to be many.	Ha ho hlokahale hore e be ngata.
Often, we pass.	Hangata, rea feta.
This is a mistake.	Ena ke phoso.
Then you can.	Joale u ka khona.
Think before you say anything, because it will not appear.	Nahana pele u bua ntho leha e le efe, hobane e ke ke ea bonahala.
I would love him.	Ke ne ke tla mo rata.
This is not the first task.	Sena ha se mosebetsi oa pele.
I have to do my job.	Ke lokela ho etsa mosebetsi oa ka.
He hopes something will go well.	O tšepa hore ho hong ho tla tsamaea.
People think a lot about other things.	Batho ba nahana haholo ka lintho tse ling.
Do all of this in advance.	Etsa tsena tsohle esale pele.
It felt like a long time now.	E ne e ikutloa nako e telele joale.
We are talking about your law.	Re bua ka molao wa hao.
According to me.	Ho ea ka.
Instead, he kept asking questions.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a ’na a botsa lipotso.
He doesn't have to say more.	Ha a tlameha ho bua ho feta.
We don't have to go anywhere to buy anything.	Ha ho hlokahale hore re ee kae kapa kae ho reka letho.
I'll say this, though.	Ke tla bolela sena, leha ho le jwalo.
It is easy to find out what happened yesterday.	Ho bonolo ho fumana se etsahetseng maobane.
The legal decision is not difficult to achieve.	Qeto ea molao ha e thata ho e fihlela.
Why you should.	Hobaneng u lokela.
That's where we spent the night.	Ke hona moo re ileng ra qeta nako bosiung boo.
I will try to find a way to fix it.	Ke tla leka ho fumana mokhoa oa ho e lokisa.
At the time it didn’t matter.	Ka nako eo ho ne ho se taba.
The idea is very clear.	Maikutlo a hlakile haholo.
None of them are here with you.	Ha ho le a mong wa bona ya leng teng mona le wena.
No one knows.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang.
It seemed pointless.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na thuso.
Then her husband found out about it.	Eaba monna oa hae o tseba ka eona.
I have to assume you are accustomed to finding your way.	Ke tlameha ho nka hore u tloaetse ho fumana tsela ea hau.
There were many of them.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
Everything is not as it seems.	Lintho tsohle ha li joalo ka ha li bonahala.
This is useful if you do not want to write it.	Sena se na le thuso haeba u sa batle ho se ngola.
This will be held tomorrow.	Sena se tla tšoaroa hosane.
Today is the last day of school.	Kajeno ke letsatsi la ho qetela la sekolo.
It is not difficult to do this.	Ha ho thata ho etsa sena.
The rest is yours.	Tse ling kaofela ke tsa hao.
Indeed, there is.	Ka sebele, ho na le.
And maybe not.	'Me mohlomong ha ho joalo.
He was the first to ask a question.	E bile eena oa pele oa ho botsa potso.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
Expect the same.	Lebella se tšoanang.
This group is even more fun.	Sehlopha sena se monate le ho feta.
I doubt he will return.	Ke belaela hore o tla khutla.
I know him better than you do.	Ke mo tseba ho u feta.
I will continue with this matter.	Ke tla tsoela pele ka taba ena.
We doubt that to be the case here.	Re belaela hore ho joalo mona.
If you buy it, you are the one who owns it.	Haeba u e reka, ke uena ea nang le eona.
I have a few new ones.	Ke na le tse 'maloa tse ncha.
Otherwise, they will always come.	Ho seng joalo, ba tla lula ba ntse ba tla.
But here comes more.	Empa mona ho tla tse ling tse ngata.
It's just a matter of finding the time and place.	Ke taba feela ea ho fumana nako le sebaka.
He sat down, thinking.	O ile a lula fatše, a nahana.
Again, and again.	Hape, le hape.
We talk about everything.	Re bua ka tsohle.
I heard a little bit about this.	Ke utloile ho se hokae ka taba ena.
He's just trying to help.	O leka ho thusa feela.
And today is your first day.	Mme kajeno ke letsatsi la hao la pele.
It was not a girl's room.	E ne e se kamore ea ngoanana.
He went to work.	O ile a ea mosebetsing.
If so, they are good.	Haeba li joalo, li ntle.
Maybe it was an idea.	Mohlomong e ne e le maikutlo.
Once they are in place they fit perfectly.	Hang ha li se li le teng li lekana hantle.
And there is a dog.	Mme ho na le ntja.
I think you will be a good father.	Ke nahana hore o tla ba ntate ya molemo.
It was the book he wanted.	E ne e le buka eo a neng a e batla.
He should have known that.	O ne a lokela ho tseba seo.
Maybe I should.	Mohlomong ke lokela.
But there is nothing for him.	Empa ha ho letho bakeng sa hae.
I was not expecting something like that.	Ke ne ke sa lebella ntho e kang eo.
But no people.	Empa ha ho batho.
I wish you could do that.	Ke rata ha o ka etsa joalo.
I'll be back for another year, of course.	Ke tla khutlela lilemo tse ling, ehlile.
See that you do well.	Bona hore o etsa hantle.
We were a man and a woman.	Re ne re le monna le mosali.
Yes, it is easy to drink.	E, ho bonolo ho noa.
I knew we could trust you.	Ke ne ke tseba hore re ka tšepa uena.
It works very well.	E sebetsa hantle haholo.
None of the others have ever tried again.	Ha ho le ea mong oa ba bang ea kileng a leka hape.
Let it be !.	E be teng!.
A little important.	E bohlokoa hanyane.
This place is beautiful.	Sebaka sena se setle.
I didn’t know where to find it, how.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na nka e fumana kae, joang.
Let’s assume the issue was a mental problem.	A re nke hore taba e ne e le bothata ba mohopolo.
You decide which one you think is best.	U etsa qeto ea hore na ke efe eo u nahanang hore e molemo ka ho fetisisa.
I will not be going away for long, for a week.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke tsamaea nako e telele, ka beke.
He was a very talkative person in his team.	E ne e le motho ea buang haholo sehlopheng sa hae.
She is also very happy.	Le eena o thabile haholo.
The same is true today.	Ho ntse ho le joalo le kajeno.
We have it all.	Re na le tsohle.
We could not reach him.	Re ne re sa khone ho fihla ho eena.
It can never make that mistake again.	E ke ke ya hlola e etsa phoso eo hape.
He was done with that now.	O ne a qetile ka seo jwale.
They can see this.	Ba ka bona sena.
So go for it.	Kahoo tsamaea haholo.
But they are not the only ones.	Empa hase bona feela.
Now they don't seem to matter.	Hona joale ha li bonahale li le bohlokoa.
Admittedly, it was not easy to get there.	Ke ’nete hore ho ne ho se bonolo ho fihla moo.
I have to do what it needs.	Ke tlameha ho etsa seo e se hlokang.
I hope that has been helpful.	Ke tšepa hore seo se bile le thuso.
And we will.	'Me re tla.
She's not very pretty.	Ha a motle hakaalo.
But he is not there.	Empa ha a eo.
He was not that great.	O ne a se moholo hakaalo.
He took good care of the children.	O ne a hlokomela bana hantle.
I would never do such a thing.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa ntho e kang eo.
I did not know them.	Ke ne ke sa ba tsebe.
It will not pass!	E ke ke ea feta!
But there is another way.	Empa ho na le mokhoa o mong.
I understand you.	Kea u utloisisa.
But he never comes.	Empa ha ho mohla a tlang.
I can't understand what it is.	Ha ke khone ho utloisisa hore na ke eng.
I would love to do more.	Nka thabela ho etsa ho feta moo.
It was a good idea.	E ne e le mohopolo o motle.
And you know this.	Mme le tseba sena.
Yes, yes, yes.	E, le e, le e.
The team started playing.	Sehlopha se ile sa qala ho bapala.
He could hear things.	O ne a utloa lintho.
I am very happy about that.	Ke thabile haholo ka seo.
Now, everybody knows it.	Jwale, bohle ba e tseba.
Passing is not always better.	Ho feta ha se kamehla ho leng betere.
I did not know how.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe joang.
That's the way to make a lot of money.	Ke eona tsela ea ho fumana chelete e ngata.
The man was powerful.	Monna e ne e le eena ea matla.
And then you keep reading him.	Mme ebe o dula o mo bala.
Think about what you are doing here.	Nahana ka seo u se etsang mona.
Sometimes in my room.	Ka linako tse ling ka kamoreng ea ka.
He could have found yours once you met.	A ka be a fumane ea hau hang ha le kopana.
I've seen people cry.	Ke bone batho ba lla.
I hope you have a great time here.	Ke tšepa hore u na le nako e monate mona.
Nor any other man.	Leha e le monna ofe kapa ofe e mong.
And we know you don't have that.	Mme rea tseba hore ha o na seo.
In others, he was not.	Ho tse ling, o ne a se joalo.
When they see the man, they all look at him.	Ha ba bona monna eo, bohle ba mo sheba.
I'll get back.	Ke tla fihla morao.
Take care of the children.	Hlokomela bana.
He gives her whatever she wants.	O mo fa eng kapa eng eo a e batlang.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka seo.
I wondered how she could do that.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na o entse seo joang.
It simply means higher power.	E mpa e bolela matla a phahameng.
From behind me.	Ho tloha ka mora ka.
He never had them.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba le tsona.
They did not expect that to happen.	Ba ne ba sa lebella hore seo se tla etsahala.
And it certainly has.	Mme ehlile ho bile jwalo.
And now it doesn't speak.	'Me joale ha e sa bua.
I was enjoying my life the way it was.	Ke ne ke thabetse bophelo ba ka ka tsela eo bo neng bo le ka eona.
He worked well.	O ne a sebetsa hantle.
One way to achieve this is through new information.	Mokhoa o mong oa ho fihlela sena ke ka litaba tse ncha.
I'm going to do that now.	Ke tla ya etsa seo jwale.
You saw it.	U e bone.
I did not find my car.	Ha kea ka ka fumana koloi ea ka.
There was money.	Ho ne ho e-na le chelete.
Eventually, things started to go well for me.	Qetellong lintho li ile tsa qala ho tsamaea hantle.
I want to go back to playing.	Ke batla ho khutlela ho bapala.
I'm so sorry, though.	Ke masoabi haholo, empa .
I wanted to thank you.	Ke ne ke batla ho le leboha.
Or you do not have it.	Kapa ha u na eona.
Enter to win here.	Kena ho hlola mona.
That is what we love.	Ke seo re se ratang.
None of them could swim.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa bona ea neng a khona ho sesa.
It doesn't matter anymore.	Ha ho sa na taba.
She was better than him.	O ne a le betere ho mo feta.
So wrong.	Ka hona phoso.
They want to get there.	Ba batla ho fihla moo.
You want to do it again, you want another chance.	O batla ho e etsa hape, o batla monyetla o mong.
That can tell us something.	Seo se ka re bolella ho hong.
I found it useless.	Ke fumane e se na thuso.
I gave them an opinion.	Ke ile ka ba fa maikutlo.
Or he pretends not to.	Kapa a etsa eka ha a joalo.
I do not think it is important in any way.	Ha ke nahane hore ho bohlokoa ka tsela e itseng.
They read it.	Ba ile ba li bala.
He refused to let her go.	O ile a hana ho mo lumella hore a tsamaee.
It's not her fault at all.	Ha se molato oa hae ho hang.
One more question.	Potso e 'ngoe hape.
Never assume that you know everything or that you are equal.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua nahana hore u tseba tsohle kapa ho lekana.
Only you and the children.	Ke uena feela le bana.
Which in some way makes him a danger to people.	E leng hore ka tsela e itseng e etsa hore a be kotsi ho batho.
It was something very close.	E ne e le ntho e haufi haholo.
I finally opened it.	Qetellong ke ile ka e bula.
We would not know what to ask for.	Re ka be re sa ka ra tseba hore na re ka kopa eng.
Or they seem to be aware of what they were missing.	Kapa ho bonahala ba tseba ka seo ba neng ba se sieo.
It certainly is.	Ka sebele ho joalo.
At that time, there was no one there	Ka nako eo, ho ne ho se na motho
So he is probably very happy.	Kahoo mohlomong o thabile haholo.
He wants me to talk to him.	O batla hore ke tl'o bua le eena.
But he did not have time to read on.	Empa o ne a se na nako ea ho bala ho ea pele.
They have to stand.	Ba na le ho ema.
I am very happy to do this work.	Ke thabile haholo ho etsa mosebetsi ona.
She was crying.	O ne a ntse a lla.
However, you have to pass.	Leha ho le joalo, u lokela ho feta.
Ask lots of questions.	Botsa lipotso tse ngata.
You need to do all you can.	U lokela ho etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang.
They talk about something that happened to me.	Ba bua ka ntho e 'ngoe e etsahetseng ho' na.
That's the problem.	Ke bothata.
And maybe not.	'Me mohlomong ha ba khone.
I can certainly hear you.	Ka sebele kea u utloa.
But there never seemed to be an opportunity.	Empa ha ho mohla ho kileng ha bonahala eka ho na le monyetla.
No one ever thought this would happen.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a nahana hore sena se tla etsahala.
They don’t make money.	Ha ba etse chelete.
He really loved her more now.	O ne a hlile a mo rata ho feta joale.
And you have to do it.	'Me u tlameha ho e etsa.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
Moreover, he used his name.	Ho feta moo, o ne a sebelisa lebitso la hae.
I still look at them carefully.	Ke ntse ke li sheba hantle.
But, in a way, it is more than that.	Empa, ka tsela e itseng, e feta ena.
We went for everything.	Re ile ra ea ho tsohle.
But somehow they did.	Empa ka tsela e itseng ba ile ba etsa joalo.
We don't have time to meet again.	Ha re sa na nako ea ho kopana le lintho tse ling hape.
She looked a little pretty this time.	O ne a shebahala a le motle hanyane ka nako ena.
Not to everyone.	Che ho e mong le e mong.
I wanted to know how it felt.	Ke ne ke batla ho tseba hore na e ikutloa joang.
That was a good question.	E ne e le potso e ntle.
Come in, baby.	Kena, ngoana.
Here, too, they encountered difficulties.	Le mona ba ile ba kopana le mathata.
That is not up to us.	Seo ha se ho rona.
I love it, she says.	Kea e rata, o re.
I have never told anyone about this.	Ha ke eso bolelle mang kapa mang taba ena.
Don't say that.	O seke wa bua jwalo.
Has he ever done that.	Na o kile a etsa joalo.
If it weren't for you, it would have been someone else's.	Hoja e ne e se wena, e ka be e bile motho e mong.
Make people care first.	Etsa hore batho ba tsotelle pele.
He was good to me.	O ne a le molemo ho nna.
I really wanted a girl.	Ke ne ke hlile ke batla ngoanana.
They saw something wrong and so they fixed it.	Ba ile ba bona ho hong ho phoso mme kahoo ba e lokisa.
Besides, it is their home.	Ntle ho moo, ke ntlo ea bona.
I stopped and looked.	Ka ema mme ka sheba.
And things like that.	Le lintho tse joalo.
He was her only son.	E ne e le mora oa hae a le mong feela.
That does nothing.	Seo ha se etse letho.
They ended your day.	Ba qetile letsatsi la hau.
The law knows.	Molao oa tseba.
Probably none of them tried.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a leka.
Some must know this.	Ba bang ba tlameha ho tseba sena.
The car is of no use to me.	Koloi ha e na thuso ho 'na.
I will not take that opportunity.	Nke ke ka nka monyetla oo.
It looks the same way only.	E shebahala ka tsela e le 'ngoe feela.
The chances of that are great.	Monyetla oa seo o moholo.
There was something wrong.	Ho bile le phoso e itseng.
Our only chance is to be first.	Monyetla oa rona feela ke ho ba pele.
You are not one of us.	Ha u e mong oa rona.
They do not know what to do.	Ha ba tsebe seo ba ka se etsang.
It's for me.	Ke bakeng sa ka.
You do not have to do any of these things.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u etse leha e le efe ea lintho tsena.
However, each of these people is an individual.	Leha ho le joalo, e mong le e mong oa batho bana ke motho ka mong.
He seemed to need something very much.	O ne a bonahala a hloka ntho ea mofuta oo haholo.
Talk about great work.	Bua ka mosebetsi o moholo.
You have to have it.	U lokela ho ba le eona.
I think it's just good.	Ke nahana hore e ntle feela.
But you're not here to talk about my family.	Empa ha o mona ho tla bua ka lelapa la ka.
He told me he would not be able to work.	O ile a mpolella hore a ke ke a khona ho sebetsa.
Everything is helpful.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le thuso.
You fell asleep last night.	O ile wa robala bosiung ba maobane.
Why, why, why.	Hobaneng, hobaneng, hobaneng.
I will think about it.	Ke tla nahana ka eona.
If it's just me, you see.	Ha se ka nna feela, o a bona.
They know that you love them.	Baa tseba hore ua ba rata.
He wants them to leave.	O batla hore ba tsamaee.
Keep thinking, you do not know.	Lula u nahana, ha u tsebe.
Just don't use it, you don't need it.	Feela u se ke ua e sebelisa, ha u e hloke.
It should be a nice car by any means.	E lokela ho ba koloi e monate ka tsela efe kapa efe.
This will not be a problem for me.	Sena e ke ke ea e-ba bothata ho 'na.
They were looking for him.	Ba ne ba mo batla.
But there is a problem.	Empa ho na le bothata.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly, to be honest.	Mohlomong ke lona lebaka le leng le entseng hore sena se nke nako e telele hakana, ho bua 'nete.
Location and route to.	Sebaka le tsela ea ho ea.
So he decided to buy a bicycle.	Kahoo o ile a etsa qeto ea ho reka baesekele.
He certainly should not have come.	Ka sebele o ne a sa lokela ho tla.
He wanted to.	O ne a batla.
I do.	Ke etsa joalo.
We both needed it.	Ka bobeli re ne re e hloka.
This is important.	Sena ke ntho ea bohlokoa.
That's not what it is to me.	Ha se seo e leng sona ho nna.
It goes well.	E tsamaea hantle.
Not at all.	Ho hang ha ho joalo.
One, where you are.	E 'ngoe, moo u leng teng.
I was there too.	Le nna ke ne ke le teng.
Money could not buy it.	Chelete e ne e ke ke ea e reka.
My mother told me that.	'Mè o ile a mpolella seo.
Knowing what is going on.	Ho tseba se etsahalang.
Whether he is.	Hore na o teng.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
We really need to work hard.	Ruri re hloka ho sebetsa ka thata.
Time is not the money.	Nako hase chelete.
And so on all night.	Mme ho ya jwalo bosiu kaofela.
Let me get it now.	E re ke e fumane hona joale.
I am no longer ashamed.	Ha ke sa le lihlong.
Some people are just shy.	Batho ba bang ba lihlong feela.
I'm sorry about the water.	Ke masoabi ka metsi.
It can help you.	E ka u thusa.
I am a girl.	Ke ngoanana.
My father cried, he was very happy.	Ntate o ile a lla, o ne a thabile haholo.
It was happening.	E ne e etsahala.
I liked it there and decided to stay.	Ke ile ka e rata moo eaba ke etsa qeto ea ho lula.
Have you had a great day?	A na u bile le letsatsi le monate?
However, they worked well without him.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba sebetsa hantle ntle le eena.
This was to be good news.	Tsena e ne e lokela ho ba litaba tse monate.
I started talking to him.	Ke ile ka qala ho bua le eena.
The same is true here.	Ho joalo le mona.
People start singing.	Batho ba qala ho bina.
Perhaps he would.	Mohlomong o ne a tla etsa joalo.
He found her sweet.	O ile a mo fumana a le monate.
You have to go to work.	U lokela ho ea mosebetsing.
He would not tell them anything.	O ne a sa tlo ba bolella letho.
They sat down.	Ba ile ba lula fatše.
Try to understand everything.	Leka ho leka ho utloisisa tsohle.
We decided to take the baby.	Re nkile qeto ea ho nka ngoana.
First, we store water.	Ea pele, re boloka metsi.
His mind also returned.	Kelello ea hae le eona ea khutla.
I hope everyone is doing well.	Ke tšepa hore bohle ba sebetsa hantle.
Most people will not notice or hear it.	Batho ba bangata ba ke ke ba e hlokomela kapa ba e utloa.
Instead he continued to watch her.	Ho e-na le hoo a tsoela pele ho mo shebella.
Me too.	Le 'na.
I consider him my father.	Ke mo nka e le ntate oa ka.
Lots of time.	Nako e ngata.
It has its name for a reason.	E na le lebitso la eona ka lebaka.
Surprisingly, both like you.	Ka mokhoa o makatsang, ka bobeli joaloka uena.
So it almost meets.	Kahoo e batla e kopana.
She looked at him intently.	A mo sheba ka hloko.
He watched them.	A ba shebella.
It's too much for people.	Ke ntho e ngata haholo bakeng sa batho.
I will fix people now.	Ke tla lokisa batho joale.
They don't want to be around you.	Ha ba batle ho ba haufi le uena.
Many are not.	Ba bangata ha ba .
I am leaving.	Kea tsamaea.
There was something else.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
And to the point of no return.	'Me ho fihlela ho se molemo.
I feel like you're on time.	Ke utloa eka u nakong.
Yes, next week.	E, bekeng e tlang.
Just do your job.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau feela.
Eventually it becomes too much for me.	Qetellong e ba ngata haholo bakeng sa ka.
He understood everything.	O ne a utloisisa ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
You only get one chance.	O fumana monyetla o le mong feela.
You know what school looks like.	Ua tseba hore na sekolo se shebahala joang.
And he got it.	Mme a e fumana.
It is an important day for them.	Ke letsatsi la bohlokoa ho bona.
I will work late.	Ke tla sebetsa ka morao ho nako.
I had no idea about that.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ka seo.
He agreed to take the job.	O ile a lumela ho nka mosebetsi oo.
And then mother.	Mme ebe mme.
This way, please.	Ka tsela ena, ka kopo.
This was obvious.	Sena se ne se hlakile.
This was a strange thing.	Sena e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
I asked the doctor a question.	Ke ile ka botsa ngaka potso.
I know a lot about him, but certainly not all.	Ke tseba haholo ka eena, empa ka sebele hase tsohle.
Another danger.	Kotsi e 'ngoe hape.
And that's a good thing.	Mme ke ntho e ntle eo.
Now everyone has it.	Hona joale bohle ba na le eona.
It will be for anyone who decides to read it.	E tla ba tsa mang kapa mang ea etsang qeto ea ho e bala.
They were absent.	Ba ne ba le sieo.
But enter.	Empa kena.
He took his son's problem.	O ile a nka bothata ba mora oa hae.
You will be a father.	U tla ba ntate.
This is an important question.	Ena ke potso ea bohlokoa.
It probably fell.	Mohlomong e ile ea oa.
You have to go fast, but you don't know where.	U tlameha ho tsamaea kapele, empa ha u tsebe moo.
But it can not be sure.	Empa e ka se be le bonnete.
However, this is a harmless mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ke phoso e se nang kotsi.
He bought it.	O ile a e reka.
Continue reading to know more.	Tsoela pele ho bala ho tseba haholoanyane.
Maybe I didn't come back.	Mohlomong ha kea khutla.
That's a name.	Ke lebitso.
They are not there to buy.	Ha ba eo ho reka.
That would have been a good thing.	Eo e ka be e bile ntho e ntle.
That's just the first one.	Eo ke oa pele feela.
Now I try to do this.	Hona joale ke leka ho etsa sena.
I had a family.	Ke ne ke e-na le lelapa.
It was a wonderful feeling.	E ne e le maikutlo a monate.
And onwards.	Le ho ya pele.
It is more true.	Ke 'nete ho feta.
I would suggest I don’t get it.	Nka etsa tlhahiso ea hore ke se ke ka e fumana.
That's what he was trying to tell you.	Ke seo a neng a leka ho o bolella sona.
The issue was to win.	Taba e ne e le ho hlola.
I expect him to be finished.	Ke lebeletse hore o se a qetile.
We didn't, of course.	Ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo, ehlile.
Of course, we said yes.	Ehlile, re itse e.
None of them.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
Time, here is the problem.	Nako, bothata ke bona.
Or to get what they did not get before.	Kapa ho fumana seo ba neng ba sa se fumana pele.
He made sure he ate well.	O ile a etsa bonnete ba hore o ja hantle.
The first issue will be the idea of ​​where to go.	Taba ea pele e tla ba mohopolo oa hore na u ka ea kae.
We love to play there.	Re rata ho bapala moo.
I looked at the girl.	Ka sheba ngoanana.
Your mom is done.	'M'e oa hau o se a qetile.
It's weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang.
The most important thing to him is money.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ho eena ke chelete.
It didn't seem to move.	E ne e sa bonahale e tsamaea.
He turned down the offer.	O ile a hana mosebetsi oo.
However, he did not believe them.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa ba lumele.
And they too would have had a wonderful time.	Mme le bona ba ka be ba bile le nako e monate.
You are the father of a boy.	U ntate oa moshanyana.
They would never fix it again.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba hlola ba e lokisa.
They talk about how they want that simple life.	Ba bua ka hore na ba batla bophelo boo bo bonolo joang.
Do it in me.	Etsa ka ho nna.
After many hours, he fell asleep.	Ka mor'a lihora tse ngata, o ile a robala.
I do not know if anyone has ever denied this money before.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ho na le motho ea kileng a hana chelete ena pele.
We needed to play hard first and then believe in the second.	Re ne re hloka ho bapala ka thata pele ebe re lumela la bobeli.
But nothing noticed.	Empa ha ho letho le ileng la hlokomela.
Even here.	Leha e le mona.
It can't find it.	Ha e khone ho e fumana.
I am leaving.	Kea tsamaea.
We just stayed with it.	Re ile ra lula le eona feela.
I did not look long.	Ha kea ka ka sheba nako e telele.
We don't, of course.	Ha re etse, ehlile.
I told them that.	Ke ile ka ba bolella seo.
More than we used to.	Ho feta kamoo re neng re tloaetse kateng.
She would be a good mother from now on.	E ne e tla ba mme ya molemo ho tloha jwale.
I think it will not.	Ke nahana hore e ke ke.
I need to see if the team is doing well.	Ke hloka ho bona hore na sehlopha se sebetsa hantle.
However, I'm not sure why it worked.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng ha e ile ea sebetsa.
But it is not that simple.	Empa ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
After the first time it is easy.	Ka mor'a lekhetlo la pele ho bonolo.
People will understand.	Batho ba tla utloisisa.
Is the man a doctor?	Na monna eo ke ngaka?
Meet him at the party.	Kopana le eena moketeng.
I hope so.	Ke tšepa joalo.
He did not speak.	Ha a ka a bua.
Let's assume that it is.	A re nke hore ho joalo.
You do not know.	Ha u tsebe.
So he did nothing.	Kahoo, ha aa ka a etsa letho.
Do not eat anything on the floor.	U se ke ua ja letho fatše.
They all knew them.	Ba ne ba ba tseba kaofela.
Work together or alone, but work well.	Sebetsa hammoho kapa u le mong, empa sebetsa hantle.
The good news is that there was nothing surprising.	Litaba tse monate ke hore ho ne ho se letho le makatsang.
Then he spoke.	Eaba oa bua.
It was very difficult.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo.
Take care of everyone.	Hlokomela bohle.
But nothing happens.	Empa ha ho letho le etsahalang.
There was more money than he could spend.	Ho ne ho e-na le chelete e ngata ho feta kamoo a neng a ka e sebelisa.
He says it right.	O e bolela hantle.
He is a great man.	O monna e moholo.
Except for a few things.	Ntle le lintho tse 'maloa.
Which is exactly what people were thinking.	E leng seo ka sebele batho ba neng ba se nahana.
They want to know when it starts.	Ba batla ho tseba ha e qala.
He arrived on time and got on well with the job.	O ile a fihla ka nako ’me a kena hantle mosebetsing.
When he finished, he was done.	Ha a qeta, o ne a qetile.
Police arrived at the scene.	Mapolesa a ile a fihla sebakeng seo.
Do you have a driver's license?	O na le lengolo la ho khanna?
Of course, never try them.	Ha e le hantle, le ka mohla u se ke ua ba leka.
If that were the case for all of us.	Hoja ho bile joalo ho rona bohle.
He does not know what this means and why he should pay.	Ha a tsebe hore na sena se bolela eng le hore na ke hobane'ng ha a lokela ho lefa.
I don't want to live my whole life like that.	Ha ke batle ho phela bophelo bohle ba ka jwalo.
You did it.	U li entse.
That was an easy thing for me.	Eo e ne e le ntho e bonolo ho 'na.
He knew that well.	O ne a tseba seo hantle.
I could no longer stand.	Ke ne nke ke ka hlola ke ema.
I love her.	Ke a mo rata.
Of course they had them.	Ehlile ba ne ba na le tsona.
Maybe knowing how this happens is not important to you.	Mohlomong ho tseba hore na sena se etsahala joang ha ho bohlokoa ho uena.
I want that benefit.	Ke batla molemo oo.
I can help.	Nka thusa.
But they are there.	Empa ba teng moo.
I was just tired.	Ke ne ke khathetse feela.
He can no longer find his wife.	Ha a sa khona ho fumana mosali oa hae.
It is life.	Ke bophelo.
I did not try this last night.	Ha kea leka sena bosiung bo fetileng.
We were in it a lot.	Re ne re le ho eona haholo.
Obviously, this is true.	Ho hlakile hore sena ke 'nete.
Let's talk about some of them.	Ha re bue ka tse ling.
He could not stand still until he was strong.	O ne a sitoa ho ema ho fihlela a e-na le matla.
Certainly not for everyone.	Ka sebele ha li bakeng sa bohle.
Sit back here.	Lula morao mona.
Many have not.	Ba bangata ha ba e-so.
I don't think you should, you know.	Ha ke nahane hore o lokela, o ya tseba.
And if we can do it, others can do it.	'Me haeba re khona ho e etsa, ba bang ba ka e etsa.
It was delicious.	E ne e le monate haholo.
Too close to say.	Ho haufi haholo ho bolela.
So, we'll see.	Kahoo, re tla bona.
Yes, we can come after all.	E, re ka tla ka mor'a tsohle.
I could see that he wanted to tell me something else.	Ke ne ke bona hore o batla ho mpolella ntho e 'ngoe hape.
That's how we love it.	Ke kamoo re e ratang kateng.
We will be fine.	Re tla phela hantle.
However, it is possible.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ka etsahala.
You did not come.	Ha ua tla.
He went with a lot of money.	O ile a tsamaea ka chelete e ngata.
You will not find anything wrong with me.	Ha o na ho fumana ntho e mpe ho nna.
Some of the last days are gone.	A mang a matsatsi a ho qetela ha a eo.
We will not call.	Ha re na ho letsetsa.
They didn’t know, and it’s so easy.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe, 'me ho bonolo joalo.
It is important.	Se bohlokoa .
Do what you want!	Etsa seo u se batlang!
I could not speak well.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho bua hantle.
So we have to be gentle.	Kahoo re lokela ho ba bonolo.
Older books are better than modern ones.	Libuka tsa khale li na le molemo ho feta tsa kajeno.
Together with your child.	Hammoho le ngoana oa hau.
Water is needed to sustain life.	Metsi aa hlokahala ho boloka bophelo.
Keep reading and you will find it.	Tsoela pele ho bala 'me u tla e fumana.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
My friends, he says, are very good.	Metsoalle ea ka, o re, e ntle haholo.
You have as many here as you.	O na le tse ngata mona joalo ka uena.
But he is not.	Empa ha a joalo.
We were too late to help.	Re ne re le morao haholo ho thusa.
Take it.	U e nke.
This has implications for it.	Sena se na le maikutlo ho sona.
It was as if we had been working together for some time.	E ne eka ke khale re sebetsa hammoho.
But that is not the case at all.	Empa ha se tsela eo ho etsahetseng ka eona ho hang.
I, perhaps more than anyone else, knew how much he loved her.	'Na, mohlomong ho feta mang kapa mang, ke ne ke tseba kamoo a mo ratang kateng.
He stood up.	A ema ka maoto.
That is not real.	Seo hase ntho ea sebele.
And a house.	Le ntlo.
Then he had an idea.	Eaba o ba le mohopolo.
We allow this to happen.	Re lumella sena ho etsahala.
But that is clearly not the case.	Empa ho hlakile hore ha ho joalo.
It is not really necessary.	Ha e hlile e hlokahala.
I'm so glad we did.	Ke thabile haholo hore ebe re entse joalo.
We do not want them.	Ha re li batle.
I really think there is something wrong.	Ke hlile ke nahana hore ho na le phoso.
Someone loved him.	Ho na le motho ea neng a mo rata.
However, we must decide to do something about it.	Leha ho le joalo, re tlameha ho etsa qeto ea ho etsa ho hong ka hona.
But he was too sad to think about it.	Empa o ne a utloile bohloko haholo hore a ka nahana ka eona hantle.
Writing takes time.	Ho ngola ho nka nako.
A little more about him.	Ho feta ka eena hanyane.
There was nothing that we could do or say.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng leo re ka le etsang kapa ra le bua.
That was hard work.	Eo e ne e le mosebetsi o boima.
It just hurts.	Ho bohloko feela.
I believed that this would be my life now.	Ke ile ka lumela hore bona e ne e tla ba bophelo ba ka hona joale.
We think he can do it.	Re nahana hore a ka e etsa.
It is often busy.	Hangata ho phathahane.
Talk! 	Bua!
The dog has that.	Ntja e na le seo.
They both represent the same work.	Ka bobeli li emetse mosebetsi o le mong.
It starts to move.	E qala ho tsamaea.
And then do not use it.	'Me joale u se ke ua e sebelisa.
I decided to eat.	Ke entse qeto ea ho ja lijo.
However, I can't talk to her.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke khone ho bua le eena.
He was not older than I was.	O ne a se moholo ho nna.
I no longer want to do this.	Ha ke sa batla ho etsa sena.
He imitated her.	O ne a mo etsa.
I wonder that.	Kea ipotsa seo.
I agree.	Kea lumela.
No kids for me.	Ha ho bana bakeng sa ka.
Like you.	Joalo ka uena.
What could this problem be.	Bothata bona e ka ba eng.
I'll just go out.	Ke tla tsoa feela.
The first impression is a good place to start.	Maikutlo a pele ke sebaka se setle sa ho qala.
I was looking for a wife.	Ke ne ke batla mosali.
I did not take your job.	Ha kea nka mosebetsi oa hau.
Do not have them.	U se ke ua ba le tsona.
Where did they go? 	Ba ile kae?
he thought.	a nahana.
He asked for money.	O ne a kopa chelete.
Write about it.	Ngola ka eona.
It had been a wonderful day.	E ne e bile letsatsi le leng le monate haholo.
However, it seemed very difficult to do this.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ile ha bonahala ho le thata haholo ho etsa sena.
That is the first step.	Eo ke boemo ba pele.
Each player has one.	Sebapali se seng le se seng se na le se le seng.
He tried to hold on to the power, to use it.	O ile a leka ho tšoara matla, ho a sebelisa.
You could have children and a family.	O ka be o bile le bana le lelapa.
They did not come.	Ha ba ka ba tla.
Life is Beautiful.	Bophelo bo monate.
I do not like it.	Ha ke e rate.
It's not where it really is.	Ha se moo e leng teng hantle.
Sometimes they just want more money.	Ka linako tse ling ba batla feela chelete e ngata.
And maybe even love to play.	'Me mohlomong le ho rata ho bapala.
You would have done it if you had been there.	O ne o tla etsa haeba o ne o le teng.
And do not be afraid of him.	'Me le se ke la mo tšaba.
He spent days thinking.	A qeta matsatsi a ntse a nahana.
Well, his and mine.	Hantle, oa hae le oa ka.
Seek and you will find.	Batlang mme le tla fumana.
He doesn't have to say anything.	Ha a tlameha ho bua letho.
The accident left me paralyzed.	Kotsi eo e ile ea etsa hore ke se ke ka khona ho tsamaea.
But no one is here.	Empa haho motho mona.
We will let it go and it will happen.	Re tla e tlohela ebe e etsahala.
That was somehow true.	E neng e le 'nete ka tsela e itseng.
Me too with it.	Le 'na ka eona.
It continued after the accident.	E ile ea tsoela pele ka mor'a kotsi.
I have some bad news.	Ke na le litaba tse bohloko.
This is not the case for most people.	Sena ha se joalo ho batho ba bangata.
I need someone to help.	Ke kopa motho a ka thusa.
Without it, it’s just speculation.	Ntle le eona, ke ho nahana feela.
Very nice person.	Motho ea motle haholo.
One reason is emotional.	Lebaka le leng ke la maikutlo.
He did not write it down.	Ha a ka a e ngola.
We are very happy that they did.	Re thabile haholo hore ebe ba ile.
You know, you look so tired.	Ua tseba, u shebahala u khathetse haholo.
It made him think about leaving.	E ile ea etsa hore a nahane ka ho tsamaea.
They were very difficult.	Li ne li le thata haholo.
Both are beautiful.	Ka bobeli li ntle.
It is dangerous to talk further.	Ho kotsi ho bua ho ea pele.
But then we made things even more fun.	Empa joale re ile ra etsa hore lintho li be monate haholoanyane.
He finally got it.	Qetellong o ile a e fumana.
Of course, right away.	Ehlile, hang hang.
Planning was not the case.	Ho rera ho ne ho se joalo.
Everyone in his team loves him.	E mong le e mong sehlopheng sa hae oa mo rata.
What he could do.	Seo a neng a ka se etsa.
It should not be too much to ask.	Ha ea lokela ho ba ngata haholo ho botsa.
Don't tell me.	O seke wa mpolella.
Just a thought.	Mohopolo feela.
There is no way out.	Ha ho tsela ea ho tsoa.
You are the only one who has never known it.	Ke uena feela ha u e-so e tsebe.
And only when things happen.	'Me feela ha ho na le lintho tse etsahalang.
Really amazing.	Ruri e makatsang.
Which probably means something good about us.	E leng hore mohlomong e bua ntho e ntle ka rona.
Thank you now.	Kea leboha ha joale.
Just the first one.	E 'ngoe feela ea pele.
You have to give.	O tlameha ho fana.
I want something to be aware of.	Ke batla ho hong ho hlokomela.
The phone rings, it rings.	Mohala oa lla, oa lla.
I do not know how this will work.	Ha ke tsebe hore na sena se tla sebetsa joang.
That's exactly what somebody told me.	Ke hantle sohle seo motho a kileng a mpolella sona.
Or, rather, they should have been.	Kapa, ​​​​ho e-na le hoo, ba ne ba lokela ho ba joalo.
The same thing happened with the second one.	Ho bile joalo le ka ea bobeli.
He never said anything.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua letho.
It was really pretty.	E ne e hlile e le ntle haholo.
I loved it so much.	Ke ne ke e rata haholo.
More so with their parents.	Ho feta joalo ka batsoali ba bona.
He knew about it.	O ne a tseba ka eona.
It was just fun, just real fun.	E ne e le monate feela, monate feela wa sebele.
They have never been so long.	Ha ba eso ka ba dula nako e telele hakana.
That must be difficult.	Seo e tlameha ebe se thata.
And that too he did not like to think about.	Mme seo le sona se ne se sa rate ho nahana ka sona.
The same is true with your book.	Ho joalo le ka buka ea hau.
It is a higher level.	Ke boemo bo phahameng haholoanyane.
I got it now.	Ke e fumane hona joale.
These are the issues that we need to address.	Ke tsona litaba tseo re lokelang ho li lokisa.
It works, if it works slowly.	E ea sebetsa, haeba e sebetsa hanyane ka hanyane.
I'm sure there is something you need.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ho na le seo o se hlokang.
He slept until late at night to finish his homework.	O ile a robala ho fihlela bosiu a qeta mosebetsi oa hae oa sekolo.
And some time with old friends.	Le nako e itseng le metsoalle ea khale.
My wife gets a house and money.	Mosali oa ka o fumana ntlo le chelete.
Anything can happen at any time.	Ntho efe kapa efe e ka etsahala ka nako efe kapa efe.
Try reading my comments again.	Leka ho bala maikutlo a ka hape.
I would not give him anything.	Ke ne nke ke ka mo fa letho.
I want to reach everyone.	Ke batla ho fihla ho bohle.
Maybe he knew his feelings.	Mohlomong o ne a tseba maikutlo a hae.
We may have some but we do not expect.	Re ka ba le tse ling empa re sa li lebella.
There is no time to do anything about it.	Ha ho nako ea ho etsa letho ka eona.
I need your help here.	Ke hloka thuso ea hau mona.
I will definitely say it again.	Ruri ke tla e bua hape.
I've seen that before.	Ke kile ka bona seo pele.
He had heard that.	O ne a utloile seo.
But soon they will be.	Empa haufinyane li tla ba teng.
I'll give you this one.	Ke tla u fa ena.
Your help has been invaluable.	Thuso ea hau e bile ea bohlokoa haholo.
Except that is not the case.	Ntle le hore ha ho joalo.
But, you can see that is not the case.	Empa, u ka bona hore ha ho joalo.
There was nothing of it.	Ho ne ho se letho la eona.
If it really does matter to you, then you can go.	Haeba e hlile e le ea bohlokoa hakaalo ho uena, joale u ka ea.
So maybe that is what happened.	Kahoo mohlomong ke se ileng sa etsahala.
So use the time.	Kahoo sebelisa nako.
And then it will be yours to learn.	'Me joale e tla ba ea hao ho ithuta.
And because he was still there.	Mme hobane o ne a ntse a le teng.
He had taken it all his life.	O ne a e nkile bophelo bohle ba hae.
That's the way people are.	Ke kamoo batho ba leng kateng.
I really live that way.	Ke hlile ke phela hoo.
He will not use his people.	A ke ke a sebelisa batho ba hae.
All of you, and my family.	Lona bohle, le lelapa la ka.
I do not need anything.	Ha ke hloke letho.
It's not him.	Ha se eena.
You also understand what you are talking about.	Le uena u utloisisa seo u buang ka sona.
Many people have done so.	Batho ba bangata ba entse joalo.
Now he doesn't care.	Hona joale ha a tsotelle.
More than us.	Ho feta ho rona.
Please think about it in the future.	Ke kopa o e nahane nakong e tlang.
It is also a great place for walking or cycling.	Hape ke sebaka se setle sa ho tsamaea kapa ho palama baesekele.
Yes, why not.	E, hobaneng ho se joalo.
Only if the person has the same problem.	Feela haeba motho a e-na le bothata bo tšoanang.
I saw the picture.	Ke bone setšoantšo.
It will not last long, it will not last long.	E ke ke ea nka nako e telele, e ke ke ea ba nako e telele.
But, we did not.	Empa, ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
Some do not take it.	Ba bang ha ba e nke.
I know you are there.	Kea tseba hore u teng.
So, they are useful.	Ka hona, li na le thuso.
You have to leave.	U tlameha ho tloha.
I have a job now.	Ke na le mosebetsi hona joale.
You have to learn everything by heart.	O tlameha ho ithuta tsohle ka hlooho.
Went to a party last week?	O ile moketeng bekeng e fetileng?
You do not say?	Ha u re?
See you.	Ke tla u bona.
It seemed there must be.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ho tlameha ho ba teng.
They were happy.	Ba ne ba thabile.
People start talking.	Batho ba qala ho bua.
This is for my benefit.	Sena ke molemo oa ka.
I'm here now.	Ke mona hona joale.
I did not intend to do so.	Ha kea rera ho etsa joalo.
He just doesn't care.	Ha a tsotelle feela.
I can't even speak.	Ha ke khone le ho bua.
We looked ahead.	Re kile ra sheba pele.
From there.	Ho tloha moo.
After 30 days you will not hear anything about it.	Ka mor'a matsatsi a mashome a mararo u ke ke ua utloa letho ka eona.
We were ahead.	Re ne re le pele.
That's your way.	Ke eona tsela ea hau.
To save time, not to mention everyone.	Ho boloka nako, ha re re bohle.
He retired this year.	O ile a tlohela mosebetsi selemong sena.
However, this is not easy.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se bonolo.
Here I am with my boyfriend.	Ke mona le mohlankana oa ka.
Finally, Dad spoke up.	Qetellong, Ntate o ile a bua.
I know a guy like him.	Ke tseba mohlankana ea tšoanang le eena.
We will assume that it is.	Re tla nka hore ho joalo.
You need to log in.	U hloka ho kena.
So he was.	Kahoo o ne a le joalo.
Most people do not understand.	Batho ba bangata ha ba ba utloisise.
I did not understand what was going on.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise se etsahalang.
I never thought it would be you.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore e tla ba uena.
I know what you are doing.	Ke tseba seo o se etsang.
I learn a lot.	Ke ithuta haholo.
That's what he thought.	Ke seo a neng a se nahana.
He can do nothing for us.	A ke ke a re etsa letho.
You will not cry.	U ke ke ua lla.
He didn't know what he was in.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na o ne a le ho eng.
And they will continue.	'Me ba tla tsoela pele.
You can enjoy the ride.	U ka thabela ho palama.
They refused to admit any wrongdoing.	Ba ile ba hana ho lumela phoso leha e le efe.
I see no fault in it.	Ha ke bone phoso.
He was not.	O ne a se jwalo.
It won't take long now.	E ke ke ea nka nako e telele joale.
One wonders why he did not do the other.	E mong oa ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha a sa ka a etsa e mong.
They certainly do not.	Ruri ha ba etse joalo.
He wanted to go very far.	O ne a batla ho tsamaea haholo.
Or, to see if someone is there.	Kapa, ​​​​ho bona hore na ho na le motho ea teng.
But if there is such a thing, then here it is.	Empa haeba ho na le ntho e joalo, joale ke eona ena.
Maybe there is more.	Mohlomong ho na le ho feta.
This is one of the other.	Ena ke e 'ngoe ea tse ling.
You have to try it.	U tlameha ho e leka.
But, yes, it is me.	Empa, e, ke 'na.
You spend a lot of time thinking about it.	U qeta nako e ngata u nahana ka eona.
The place was amazing.	Sebaka seo e ne e le se makatsang.
The first was the first to speak.	Ea pele e bile eena oa pele oa ho bua.
The clothes were not beautiful.	Liaparo li ne li se ntle.
We started eating.	Re ile ra qala ho ja.
However.	Leha ho se joalo.
Which it is.	E leng eona.
I really want this.	Ke hlile ke batla sena.
I have some things to think about right now.	Ke na le lintho tse ling tseo ke lokelang ho nahana ka tsona hona joale.
It was then.	E ne e bile nakong eo.
This works very well.	Sena se sebetsa hantle haholo.
So this was the same thing.	Kahoo sena e ne e le ntho e tšoanang.
I'm sure you do too.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore le uena u etsa joalo.
I'm telling you something.	Ke o bolella ho hong.
That started right there.	Seo se ile sa qala hona moo.
I will never see it again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke bona.
Do you do this alone? 	U etsa see u le mong?
We will consider your request.	Re tla nahana ka kopo ea hau.
He looks clear to me.	O shebahala a hlakile ho nna.
All he wanted to do was get out of there.	Sohle seo a neng a batla ho se etsa ke ho tloha moo.
All night sometimes.	Bosiu bohle ka linako tse ling.
It was nice to be around someone once.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba haufi le motho hang.
It is very difficult for me to do it.	Ho thata haholo ho nna ho e etsa.
It was not what he was.	E ne e se seo a neng a le sona.
Do not tell anyone else.	U se ke ua bolella batho ba bang hape.
He's just too heavy.	O mpa a le boima haholo.
But that was in the future.	Empa hoo e ne e le nakong e tlang.
Maybe they did it for everyone else.	Mohlomong ba ile ba e etsetsa ba bang kaofela.
This was exactly what it was.	Sena e ne e le sona seo hantle.
His life has always been good.	Haesale bophelo ba hae bo le monate.
The best book of the time.	Buka e ntle ka ho fetisisa ea nako.
I allowed nothing more than me.	Ha kea lumella letho ho feta ho 'na.
That makes them easier to use.	Seo se etsa hore li be bonolo ho li sebelisa.
I think it should be good for us.	Ke nahana hore e tlameha ho ba molemo ho rona.
And you were one of them.	Mme o ne o le e mong wa bona.
You love one, you love another.	O rata e mong, o rata e mong.
I had never thought of that before.	Ke ne ke eso nahane ka taba eo pele.
The young man had just finished.	Mohlankana o ne a qeta ho qeta.
I can do this.	Nka etsa sena.
I met strange people.	Ke kopane le batho ba makatsang.
But he asked anyway.	Empa o ile a botsa leha ho le joalo.
He can stay.	A ka lula .
The reason is very simple, those things are not real life.	Lebaka le bonolo haholo, lintho tseo ha se bophelo ba sebele.
I say to him every morning.	Ke re hoseng ho eena letsatsi le letsatsi.
The second is mental.	Ea bobeli ke ea kelello.
I know what you were thinking.	Ke tseba seo u neng u se nahana.
It does not matter.	Ha ho na taba.
Dinner came quickly.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea li ile tsa tla kapele.
We didn't find another way, but he found it.	Ha rea ​​ka ra fumana tsela e ’ngoe, empa o ile a e fumana.
That's not very good.	Seo ha se setle haholo.
No problem at all while using it.	Ha ho na bothata ho hang ha u ntse u e sebelisa.
I took a job.	Ke nkile mosebetsi.
We're done!	Re se re qetile!
I'll tell you what you want to know.	Ke tla o bolella seo o batlang ho se tseba.
I have to ask.	Ke 'na ea lokelang ho botsa.
However he said nothing.	Leha ho le joalo ha aa ka a bua letho.
So far.	Ho fihlela joale.
But he is too big and too strong for them.	Empa o moholo haholo mme o matla bakeng sa bona hape.
No one has ever known for sure.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a tseba hantle.
I ask for his name again.	Ke kopa lebitso la hae hape.
This is mine.	Ena ke ea ka.
I go for a few and it's easy.	Ke ea ho tse 'maloa' me ho ba bonolo.
Anything outside was beyond him.	Ntho leha e le efe e ka ntle e ne e mo feta.
I have friends.	Ke na le metsoalle.
I was a boy.	Ke ne ke le moshanyana.
Most people are not like that.	Batho ba bangata ha ba joalo.
Maybe he had it too.	Mohlomong le eena o ne a e-na le eona.
Instead, she nodded.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a lumela ka hlooho.
Then there is the time.	Ebe ho na le nako.
When we got here, there were a lot of people here, too.	Ha re fihla mona, ho ne ho e-na le batho ba bangata mona, hape.
This did not last very long.	Sena ha sea ka sa nka nako e telele haholo.
So far, it feels good.	Ho fihlela joale, e ikutloa e le ntle.
So, you never told anyone.	Kahoo, ha ua ka ua bolella motho.
It would not be easy.	Ho ne ho sa tlo ba bonolo.
I was devastated by what had happened.	Ke ne ke utloile bohloko haholo ke se etsahetseng.
No problems so far.	Ha ho na mathata ho fihlela joale.
You are very important to us.	U bohlokoa haholo ho rona.
You have to try one last time.	O tlameha ho leka la ho qetela.
But he did more than just talk.	Empa ha aa ka a bua feela.
Of course I will be reading by then.	Ehlile ke tla be ke bala ka nako eo.
It's not a road, it's a place.	Ha se tsela, ke sebaka.
This is from children.	Sena se tsoa ho bana.
This will be true for me next year.	Sena e tla ba 'nete ea ka selemong se tlang.
They return home.	Ba khutlela hae.
He was just happy.	O ne a thabile feela.
I think this would be good for you to be with you.	Ke nahana hore sena se ka ba molemo ho uena ho ba le uena.
He gets it all.	O fumana tsohle.
At the end of the day he is tired.	Qetellong ea letsatsi o khathetse.
I love you.	Kea u rata.
There is no other reason.	Ha ho lebaka le leng.
They stayed there for three days.	Ba dula moo matsatsi a mararo.
And this is a great opportunity to get to know people.	'Me ona ke monyetla o motle oa ho tseba ka batho.
How can I fix this.	Nka lokisa sena joang.
It can be very difficult.	Ho ka ba thata haholo.
He goes beyond that.	O feta moo.
And now he's gone, he's gone.	Mme jwale o ile, o ile.
She doesn't like it.	Ha a o rate.
The process is complex, but not complicated.	Mokhoa ona o boima, empa ha o thata.
You can use a simple method to know this.	U ka sebelisa mokhoa o bonolo ho tseba sena.
Both will be more frequent than that.	Ka bobeli le tla ba teng hangata ho feta moo.
It could have been worse.	E ka be e bile mpe le ho feta.
They just want power and money.	Ba batla matla le chelete feela.
I went to school and to class.	Ke ile sekolong le sehlopheng.
Then he said more.	Eaba o bua ho feta.
People actually drive that road from time to time.	Batho ba hlile ba khanna tsela eo nako le nako.
He was like that.	O ne a le jwalo.
He said he would fix everything.	O itse o tla lokisa tsohle.
And none of it would be good.	'Me ha ho le e 'ngoe ea eona e neng e tla ba ntle.
Night is coming, now.	Bosiu bo a tla, jwale.
Maybe it was my problem.	Mohlomong e ne e le bothata ba ka.
It's a walk.	Ke ho tsamaea.
Stay where you are.	Dula moo o leng teng.
I looked ahead.	Ke ile ka sheba ka pele.
They have never been like that.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba joalo.
He too helped.	Le eena o ile a thusa.
That is my job.	Ke mosebetsi oa ka oo.
They don't think.	Ha ba nahane.
Ignorance, perhaps, but in a positive way.	Ho se tsotelle, mohlomong, empa ka tsela e ntle.
He was there to study.	O ne a le teng ho tla ithuta.
Nice to meet you.	Ke thabetse ho kopana le uena.
And it is certainly a good thing.	'Me ka sebele ke ntho e ntle.
Are we talking to you?	Na re ntse re bua le uena?
It's just an important process.	Ke mokhoa feela oa bohlokoa.
We too had nothing for our baby.	Le rōna re ne re se na letho bakeng sa ngoana oa rōna.
So, of course, you got to know them.	Kahoo, ka sebele u ile ua ba tseba.
But he was already too late.	Empa o ne a se a le morao haholo.
This morning it was very easy.	Hoseng hona ho bile bonolo haholo.
But this is actually not a book.	Empa ha e le hantle sena ha se buka.
For them as it pleases.	Bakeng sa bona kamoo e ratang kateng.
It may have been talking to you.	E ka 'na eaba e ne e bua le uena.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
Everything that was there.	Sohle se neng se le teng.
You can't do it that way.	O ka se e etse ka tsela eo.
But the work is really hard.	Empa mosebetsi o hlile o boima.
We get all that.	Re fumana tseo tsohle.
More than you think you know.	Ho feta kamoo o nahanang hore oa tseba.
After he left, we never saw him again.	Ka mor'a hore a tsamaee, ha rea ​​ka ra hlola re mo bona hape.
Here is the good news for you.	Litaba tse monate ke tsena bakeng sa hau.
He refused to drink.	O ile a hana ho noa.
That will never happen again.	Seo ha se sa tla hlola se etsahala.
He hoped he did not feel that way when he entered.	O ne a tšepa hore ha aa ka a ikutloa joalo ha a kena.
You know what we do.	U tseba seo re se etsang.
I know better than you.	Ke tseba ho o feta.
Thank people over and over again.	Leboha batho hangata le hangata.
Now they think they are doing it.	Hona joale ba nahana hore ba etsa joalo.
And somehow it also exists.	Mme ka tsela e itseng e teng hape.
Water comes out quickly.	Metsi a tsoa kapele.
They went in without water; they went in without food.	Ba kena ba se na metsi, ba kena ba sa ja.
That is something we must do.	Ke ntho eo re lokelang ho e etsa.
I have to know what's going on here.	Ke tlameha ho tseba se etsahalang mona.
You are going to bed.	U ea robala.
There was so much to learn.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
He was not a man.	E ne e se motho.
It looked good.	E ne e shebahala hantle.
Some never do that.	Ba bang ha ho mohla ba etsang joalo.
I wanted to.	Ke ne ke batla.
Still, he looks good.	Leha ho le joalo, o bonahala a le motle.
He had made me want to live again.	O ne a entse hore ke batle ho phela hape.
He drove carefully.	O ile a khanna ka hloko.
But after that, there are no problems.	Empa ka mor'a moo, ha ho na mathata.
That really happens.	Seo se hlile se etsahala.
I hope so, you see.	Kea tšepa, ua bona.
He had a job to do and he did it.	O ne a na le mosebetsi oo a lokelang ho o etsa mme a o etsa.
This place is amazing.	Sebaka sena se makatsang.
You should come back with us.	U lokela ho khutla le rona.
I think there is something wrong with his head.	Ke nahana hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso ka hlooho ea hae.
So that was hard for him.	Kahoo seo se ne se le thata ho eena.
You only got one chance.	O fumane monyetla o le mong feela.
Certainly not new.	Ka sebele e ne e se ncha.
I will write.	Ke tla ngola.
It is real to me.	Ke ntho ea sebele ho 'na.
I got up to open the door.	Ka ema ho ya bula lemati.
This is just a new fact.	Sena ke 'nete e ncha feela.
I could not help him.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho mo thusa.
Here is the way.	Tsela ke ena.
This will seem very difficult.	Sena se tla bonahala se le thata haholo.
They really just want to live.	Ha e le hantle ba batla ho phela feela.
Yes, that's right.	E, ho joalo.
Dad or me.	Ntate kapa 'na.
But they will come.	Empa ba tla tla.
If you have a problem, we have a problem.	Ha o na le bothata, re na le bothata.
Make sure they are happy.	Etsa bonnete ba hore ba thabile.
He had to look ahead.	O ne a lokela ho sheba pele.
I hope it will help.	Ke tšepa hore e tla thusa.
Baby, do you really think it would be so easy?	Ngoana, na u hlile u nahana hore ho tla ba bonolo hakaalo?
We knew it was there.	Re ne re tseba hore e teng.
My children.	Bana ba ka.
That was a long time.	Eo e ne e le nako e telele.
That's good news.	Ke litaba tse monate.
I was very tired and my head hurt.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo ’me hlooho ea ka e le bohloko.
All the real help is needed.	Thuso eohle ea sebele ea hlokahala.
I have never seen anything like it.	Ha ke eso bone ntho e kang eo.
Of course, you should not do that.	Ha e le hantle, ha ua lokela ho etsa joalo.
Then write the idea.	Ebe u ngola mohopolo.
I had finally found my place.	Qetellong ke ne ke fumane sebaka sa ka.
Often it is not just one simple matter.	Hangata ha se ntho e le 'ngoe feela e bonolo.
I just have to learn from it.	Ke tlameha feela ho ithuta ho eona.
The clothes were very tight.	Liaparo li ne li le thata haholo.
I don't know what it was.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e ne e le eng.
I think she is very beautiful.	Ke nahana hore o motle haholo.
But my hands knew what to do.	Empa matsoho a ka a ne a tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
This is very easy to do.	Ho bonolo haholo ho sebetsa sena.
Where my parents lived.	Eo batsoali ba ka ba neng ba lula ho eona.
He did not thank or anything.	Ha a ka a leboha kapa letho.
What matters is what you think and feel.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke seo u se nahanang le maikutlo a hau.
She was the only woman he loved.	Ke eena feela mosali eo a neng a mo rata.
If anything, it becomes more difficult.	Haeba ho na le letho, ho ba thata le ho feta.
He had trouble finding a job.	O ne a na le bothata ba ho fumana mosebetsi.
He did not necessarily have problems.	Ho ne ho se hakaalo hore o na le mathata.
They will get better.	Ba tla ba betere.
Then we realized that this was not necessary.	Joale, re ile ra hlokomela hore ha ho hlokahale hore ho be joalo.
We'll get something tomorrow.	Re tla fumana ho hong hosane.
Everyone already knows how to do it.	E mong le e mong o se a ntse a tseba hore o lokela ho e etsa.
He did not see the need to tell her the truth.	O ne a sa bone ho hlokahala hore a mo bolelle ’nete.
He has a passion for it.	O na le seo a se ratang.
It was the best job ever!	E ne e le mosebetsi o motle ka ho fetisisa!
I try to live it in real time.	Ke leka ho e phela ka nako ea sebele.
He would love this.	O ne a ka rata sena.
He must have wondered what the real thing would be like.	E tlameha ebe o ne a ipotsa hore na ntho ea sebele e tla ba joang.
And that's not it.	Mme ha se seo.
When we enter.	Ha re kena.
I could have done it.	Nka be ke e entse.
However, not everyone loves us.	Leha ho le joalo, hase bohle ba re ratang.
Or, you know.	Kapa, ​​ua tseba.
It comes from the back.	E tsoa ka morao.
Now he knows what is going to happen, and he knows he wants it.	Hona joale o tseba se tla etsahala, 'me oa tseba hore oa e batla.
I could not get an opinion.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho fumana maikutlo.
He offers something.	O fana ka ho hong.
He was not coming very far.	O ne a sa tla haholo.
We go as fast as we can.	Re tsamaea kapele kamoo re ka khonang.
Then his hands.	Ebe matsoho a hae.
The road was very difficult to navigate.	Tsela e ne e le thata haholo ho tsamaea.
Using it will be even more difficult.	Ho e sebelisa ho tla ba thata le ho feta.
Otherwise, we do nothing.	Ho seng joalo, ha re etse letho.
You can take your time.	U ka nka nako ea hau.
He had an accident very close to him.	O ile a tšoaroa ke kotsi a le haufi haholo le eena.
Of any man,.	Ea motho ofe kapa ofe,.
Plan your meal in advance.	Rera lijo tsa hau esale pele.
I think it will go well.	Ke nahana hore e tla tsamaea hantle.
There are no silly questions.	Ha ho na lipotso tse hlokang kelello.
Fix things now.	Lokisa lintho hona joale.
There is no such thing.	Ha ho letho le joalo feela.
People loved them.	Batho ba ne ba li rata.
We talked for a long time.	Re ile ra bua nako e telele.
We are glad to have you!	Re thabetse hore ebe re u fumane!
They can't do that now.	Ba ke ke ba etsa joalo hona joale.
Without it, we would not be able to survive.	Ntle ho moo, re ne re ke ke ra khona ho phela.
Why can't they do something about it?	Hobaneng ba sa khone ho etsa ho hong ka seo?
He makes us do what we are supposed to do.	O etsa hore re etse seo re lokelang ho se etsa.
It is a time for new things.	Ke nako ea tse ncha.
But maybe that was the way out.	Empa mohlomong e ne e le tsela ea ho tsoa.
And there are good ones.	Mme ho na le tse ntle.
Now everything works as it should.	Hona joale ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e sebetsa kamoo e lokelang.
There is no law.	Haho molao.
He still doesn't know about it, yet.	Ha a e-so tsebe ka eona, le joale.
He asked if he could call her again.	O ile a botsa hore na a ka mo letsetsa hape.
It will not take you long.	E ke ke ya o nka nako e telele.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
She must have been waiting for him.	E tlameha ebe o ne a mo emetse.
Here's what you need to know.	Mona ke seo u hlokang ho se tseba.
Maybe it's because it's your last chance.	Mohlomong ke hobane ke monyetla oa hau oa ho qetela.
I know what's going to happen there.	Ke tseba se tlang ho etsahala moo.
Now you speak.	Joale ua bua.
I don't think about it.	Ha ke nahane ka eona.
And they did.	Mme ba ile ba etsa jwalo.
Or it just cries.	Kapa e mpa e lla feela.
It can be the same with you.	Ho ka ba joalo le ho uena.
Which he did, of course.	E leng seo e se entseng, ehlile.
But you will get nothing from me.	Empa ha o sa tla fumana letho ho nna.
This was a thought.	Ena e ne e le mohopolo.
I do not know how often.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ha kae.
It will take us a while to do this.	Ho tla re nka nako ho etsa sena.
They are easy to know, but hard to know.	Li bonolo ho li tseba, empa ho thata ho li tseba.
Think about it carefully.	Nahana ka eona ka hloko.
All right.	Hantle.
We had found them.	Re ne re li fumane.
They just don't meet.	Ha li kopane feela.
You do not want them to find you.	Ha u batle hore ba u fumane.
I'll just stay right here.	Ke tla dula hantle feela mona.
That's where it happened.	Ke hona moo e etsahetseng teng.
You will be one of them.	U tla ba e mong oa bona.
Nice to know.	Ho monate ho tseba.
Everyone was on the team last year.	E mong le e mong o ne a le sehlopheng selemong se fetileng.
Moreover, she now knew that she had never really loved him.	Ho feta moo, joale o ne a tseba hore ha ho mohla a kileng a mo rata.
People are afraid to take them.	Batho ba tšaba ho li nka.
But he did not get a chance.	Empa ha a ka a fumana monyetla.
Something that makes you think.	Ntho e etsang hore o nahane.
Then he came.	Eaba oa tla.
There would be no place.	Ho ka be ho se sebaka.
He has spent his whole life here.	O qetile bophelo bohle ba hae mona.
I know you love her.	Kea tseba hore ua mo rata .
This was true, but it was powerful.	Sena se ne se le joalo, empa se ne se le matla.
You usually only eat once a day.	Hangata o ja hang feela ka letsatsi.
He would find a way.	O ne a tla fumana tsela.
I refused dinner.	Ke ile ka hana lijo tsa mantsiboea.
Plus if you need any help.	Ho feta moo haeba o hloka thuso efe kapa efe.
But more than that.	Empa ho feta moo.
Both are very painful.	Ka bobeli li utloa bohloko haholo.
She reads a lot.	O bala haholo.
And now they know that they are not there.	'Me joale baa tseba hore ha ba eo.
So when you do something, be the best.	Kahoo ha u etsa ntho e itseng, e-ba ea molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He has been waiting for this.	Esale a emetse sena.
We can no longer use him.	Re ke ke ra hlola re mo sebelisa.
You will not find them.	U ke ke ua li fumana.
He wanted to be there.	O ne a rata hore a be teng.
Sit down!	Lula fatše!
I even thought no one noticed.	Ke bile ke nahana hore ha ho motho ea ileng a hlokomela.
His feelings were bad.	Maikutlo a hae a ne a le mpe.
Everyone is dangerous.	E mong le e mong o kotsi.
We need to know who made it.	Re lokela ho tseba hore na ke mang ea e entseng.
Children do not know everything.	Bana ha ba tsebe tsohle.
Surely one would see.	Ka sebele motho o ne a tla bona.
We know this is difficult.	Rea tseba hore sena se thata.
They continued talking as they left.	Ba ile ba tsoela pele ho bua ha ba ntse ba tsoa.
Then again, he and I are about the same age.	Joale hape, 'na le eena re batla re lekana ka lilemo.
They were in the back.	Ba ne ba le ka morao.
We may not understand it, but there is one thing we can do.	Re ka ’na ra se ke ra utloisisa, empa ho na le ntho e le ’ngoe eo re ka e etsang.
Certainly not.	Ka sebele ha ho joalo.
And what we have is something that does not exist.	Mme seo re nang le sona ke ntho eo e sieo.
Then the police car stopped.	Joale koloi ea mapolesa ea ema.
He did, and they said yes.	O ile a etsa joalo, 'me ba re ho joalo.
I don't know what to do.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o tla etsang.
One is greater than the other.	E mong o moholo ho feta e mong.
It was you.	E ne e le uena.
It feels very real. 	E ikutloa e le ea sebele haholo. 
it's really simple.	e hlile e bonolo.
When my parents found out, they did.	Ha batsoali ba ka ba tseba, ba ile ba.
It will not mean.	Ha ho na ho bolela.
Someone said.	E mong a bua.
We must not forget the past.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho lebala lintho tse fetileng.
Stop, that was it.	Ema, e ne e le seo.
Because no one ever made me look for him.	Ke hobane ha ho motho ea kileng a etsa hore ke mo batle.
I did not wear it.	Ha kea ka ka e apara.
I told her about what had happened to me.	Ke ile ka mo bolella ka se etsahetseng ho ’na.
And in the back, after both of them.	'Me ka morao, ka mor'a bobeli ba bona .
But it did not help.	Empa ha ea ka ea thusa.
In fact, truth exists outside the human mind.	Ha e le hantle, 'nete e teng ka ntle ho kelello ea motho.
Maybe more than that.	Mohlomong ho feta moo.
They never did.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba etsa joalo.
Fresh coffee was great.	Kofi e ncha e ne e le ntle.
But it did not start.	Empa ha ea ka ea qala.
He too began to sing it.	Le eena a qala ho e bina.
So we find out that nothing wrong has happened.	Ka hona re fumana hore ha ho phoso e etsahetseng.
You just need to say nothing about it.	U hloka feela ho bua letho ka eona.
And I spend three years.	'Me ke qeta lilemo tse tharo.
His name was.	Lebitso la hae e ne e le.
We will never allow this to happen again.	Re ke ke ra hlola re lumella sena ho etsahala hape.
That would be great fun.	Hoo ho ka ba monate haholo.
He didn't want to play with me.	O ne a sa batle ho bapala le 'na.
Here's another one right here.	E 'ngoe ke ena hantle mona.
At the end of the day.	Qetellong ya letsatsi.
You haven't wanted anything yet.	Ha o eso batle letho le leng.
He dreamed of becoming a doctor.	O ne a lakatsa ho ba ngaka.
The man watched.	Monna eo o ile a shebella.
Only one person did this.	Ke motho a le mong feela ea entseng sena.
It was not our idea.	E ne e se mohopolo wa rona.
It is the same thing with money.	Ke ntho e le 'ngoe ka chelete.
Sometimes you forget how beautiful it was.	Ka linako tse ling u lebala kamoo e neng e le ntle kateng.
We would not win anything.	Re ne re sa tlo hlola letho.
They were all alive.	Bohle ba ne ba phela.
They probably won't do it.	Mohlomong ba ke ke ba e etsa.
You could not make a good time.	U ne u sa khone ho etsa nako e ntle.
We were supposed to be a group but we are not.	Re ne re lokela ho ba sehlopha empa ha re joalo.
But it does not have to be this way.	Empa ha ho a tlameha ho ba ka tsela ena.
We are all clear.	Kaofela ha rona re hlakile.
Worse than before.	E mpe ho feta pele.
I have not found one anywhere.	Ha ke e-s'o fumane e le 'ngoe kae kapa kae.
I'm sure.	Ke na le bonnete.
They love them too.	Le bona ba a ba rata.
There is a lot of risk.	Ho na le litaba tse ngata tse kotsing.
No, that 's not my business.	Che, ha se taba ea ka.
He looked at it.	O ile a o sheba.
I do not go that way.	Ha ke tsamaee ka tsela eo.
I get home.	Ke fihla hae.
One of them knew him.	E mong oa bona o ile a mo tseba.
I couldn’t drive anywhere, for long.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho khanna kae kapa kae, ka nako e telele.
It's a very interesting feeling.	Ke maikutlo a monate haholo.
Things like this take time.	Lintho tse kang tsena li nka nako.
I think about him all the time.	Ke nahana ka eena ka linako tsohle.
I wonder what his name would be.	Kea ipotsa hore na lebitso la hae e ne e tla ba mang.
That's what people say.	Ke seo batho ba se buang.
Your son used to know mine.	Mora oa hao o ne a tloaetse ho tseba oa ka.
There was nothing you could do.	Ho ne ho se letho leo o ka le etsang.
You just got it.	O sa tsoa e fumana.
You have to think fast.	U tlameha ho nahana kapele.
How can this be?	See se ka etsahala joang?
This is nothing new.	Sena ha se ntho e ncha.
They are not.	Ha ba eo.
In fact, it was very simple.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le bonolo haholo.
And it was too late.	Mme e ne e se e le morao haholo.
I'm trying to find out.	Ke leka ho fumana.
Thanks for coming again.	Ke leboha ho tla hape.
Otherwise, the room was empty.	Ho seng joalo, kamore e ne e se na letho.
They can't play.	Ha ba khone ho bapala.
Look here.	Sheba mona.
I may try to do that.	Nka 'na ka leka ho etsa joalo.
Not all of them have it.	Hase kaofela ha bona ba nang le eona.
I wanted to ask your opinion.	Ke ne ke batla ho botsa maikutlo a hau.
She looked at her husband.	A sheba monna wa hae.
I just feel that way.	Ke ikutloa joalo feela.
he comes every morning.	o tla hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
That makes it very difficult to help you.	Seo se etsa hore ho be thata haholo ho u thusa.
I just don’t see that.	Ha ke bone seo feela.
The hair was there.	Moriri o ne o le teng.
Your head is your mind.	Hlooho ea hau ke kelello ea hau.
But this once.	Empa sena hang.
She always sings when she is happy.	O bina kamehla ha a thabile.
It's hard, but you can learn.	Ho thata, empa u ka ithuta.
Where were you?	O ne o le kae.
It seemed we were doing that in this area.	Ho ne ho bonahala re etsa joalo sebakeng sena.
It's a request for my play.	Ke ho kopa ho bapala ha ka.
It's really long.	Ruri e telele.
But one thing seems certain.	Empa ntho e le 'ngoe e bonahala e ka etsahala.
He has always been.	Haesale a le jwalo.
Just a look.	Ho sheba feela.
From there it opens more.	Ho tloha moo e bula ho feta.
Because there is work.	Hobane mosebetsi o teng.
I just want to help you.	Ke batla ho o thusa feela.
But his head was clear again.	Empa hlooho ea hae e ne e hlakile hape.
Her doctor is still taking care of her.	Ngaka ea hae ea mo hlokomela le hona joale.
It was a name, of course.	E ne e le lebitso, ehlile.
Maybe that's why he felt he couldn't tell anyone.	Mohlomong ke ka lebaka leo a neng a ikutloa a sa khone ho bolella mang kapa mang.
A few things are clear enough, though.	Lintho tse 'maloa li hlakile ka ho lekaneng, leha ho le joalo.
Can he do it? 	Na a ka e etsa?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
They should be treated equally.	Ba lokela ho tšoaroa ka ho lekana.
However, we still had food.	Leha ho le joalo, re ne re ntse re e-na le lijo.
But it is not necessary.	Empa ha ho hlokahale.
Of course you heard about it.	Ehlile le utloile ka eona.
I knew then, if not the one.	Ke ne ke tseba ka nako eo, haeba e se mang.
But that is not always the case.	Empa ha ho joalo kamehla.
Stop, hold,.	Ema, tšoara,.
If he is.	Haeba a le teng.
You would not know from the place.	U ne u ke ke ua tseba ho tloha sebakeng.
I mean exactly what happened.	Ke bolela hantle se etsahetseng.
He wanted to stay there.	O ne a batla ho lula moo.
I could hear and understand everything that was happening.	Ke ne ke khona ho utloa le ho utloisisa ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe e neng e etsahala.
Of course they understood.	Ehlile ba ne ba utloisisa.
Nothing.	Ha ho na letho.
Nothing looked good.	Ha ho letho le neng le shebahala hantle.
I did not expect him to do so.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore a se ke a etsa joalo.
You do not understand the point of danger.	Ha u utloisise taba ea kotsi.
And many more like that.	Le tse ling tse ngata tse joalo.
And, frankly, they will continue to do it.	'Me, ho bua 'nete, ba tla tsoela pele ho e etsa.
I could not believe him.	Ha kea ka ka mo lumela.
He knew what he was going to say next.	O ne a tseba seo a tla se bua ka mor’a moo.
That makes you one of them.	Seo se o etsa e mong wa bona.
We see them almost every day.	Re ba bona hoo e ka bang letsatsi le leng le le leng.
I wonder about that.	Kea ipotsa ka seo .
He picked her up, not knowing who she was.	A mo nka, a sa tsebe hore na ke mang.
There is no time to look for other food.	Ha ho nako ea ho batla lijo tse ling.
Everyone is happy.	E mong le e mong o thabile.
He didn't care about us at the time.	O ne a sa tsotelle le rōna ka nako eo.
Then the guilt came in.	Eaba molato oa kena.
The second felt.	Ea bobeli a ikutloa.
First of all, thank you for all you did.	Taba ea pele, ke leboha sohle seo u se entseng.
There is a car in front.	Ho na le koloi ka pele.
He knew he had to forget her.	O ne a tseba hore o tlameha ho mo lebala.
The children were thrilled to hear the news.	Bana ba ile ba thabela ho utloa litaba tseo.
You are one of them.	U e mong oa bona.
Please go ahead.	Ke kopa o ee pele.
It must leave.	E tlameha ho tloha.
I don't know that.	Ha ke tsebe seo.
Of course it will be fine.	Ehlile ho tla ba hantle.
He did not even understand the child.	O ne a sa utloisise le ngoana.
He was where he was.	O ne a le moo a neng a le teng.
No need to buy.	Ha ho hlokahale ho reka.
This will happen if such a thing happens.	Sena se tla etsahala haeba ho etsahala ntho e joalo.
You can buy anything there.	U ka reka eng kapa eng moo.
I get my good stuff that way.	Ke fumana lintho tsa ka tse ntle ka tsela eo.
I don't know, of course.	Ha ke tsebe, ehlile.
And certainly some will come.	'Me ka sebele ba bang ba tla.
Once a week, we will visit a doctor.	Hang ka beke, re tla etela ngaka.
He was just like that.	O ne a le joalo feela.
The young man looked at the girl.	Mohlankana a sheba ngoanana.
That looks really good.	Seo se shebahala hantle haholo.
You really have to go where the people are.	Ka ‘nete u tlameha ho ea moo batho ba leng teng.
It is not at all dangerous.	Ho hang ha se kotsi.
It is better not to do so.	Ho molemo hore re se ke ra etsa joalo.
These he would have to read.	Tsena o ne a tla tlameha ho li bala.
Tomorrow will be just another day for me.	Hosane e tla ba letsatsi le leng feela ho nna.
There are only a few of them.	Ho na le tse ling feela tsa tsona.
That was never his job.	Oo e ne e se mosebetsi oa hae le ka mohla.
It is not surprising.	Ha se ntho e makatsang haholo.
This work seems to have done just that.	Ho bonahala eka mosebetsi ona o entse joalo.
For some of them, I a.	Ho ba bang ba bona, ke a.
She is a big girl.	Ke ngoanana e moholo.
He didn't want to wear it.	O ne a sa batle ho e apara.
I know you had to do it.	Kea tseba hore u ne u tlameha ho e etsa.
We'll get in later.	Re tla kena ka morao.
I'm so glad we are friends.	Ke thabile haholo hore ebe re metsoalle.
I could not use him.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho mo sebelisa.
However, it is better to come soon.	Leha ho le joalo, ho molemo ho tla kapele.
I'll give it a chance, though.	Ke tla e fa monyetla, leha ho le joalo.
I will look at it again.	Ke tla e sheba hape.
Yes, it can be difficult.	E, ho ka ba thata.
Find out how !.	Fumana kamoo!.
There are so many good things that way.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tse ntle ka tsela eo.
He worked nights.	O ne a sebetsa bosiu.
I thought we were close friends.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re metsoalle e haufi.
Nobody there.	Haho motho moo.
Out front.	Ka ntle ka pele.
That is exactly what they want to hear.	Ke sona seo ba batlang ho se utloa hantle.
I hope it works well.	Ke tšepa hore e sebetsa hantle.
You do things together.	Le etsa lintho hammoho.
I would walk backwards.	Ke ne ke tla tsamaea ka maoto ka morao.
Who loved him more than anyone.	Ea neng a mo rata ho feta mang kapa mang.
The boy just looks.	Moshanyana o shebahala feela.
Not a good picture.	Ha se setšoantšo se setle.
This applies to me and to you as well.	Sena se sebetsa ho nna le ho uena hape.
So, do something !.	Kahoo, etsa ho hong!.
It seems I can't help it.	Ho bonahala eka ha ke khone ho e thusa.
However, you still have to visit.	Leha ho le joalo, u ntse u lokela ho etela.
That's the way he was.	Ke kamoo a neng a le kateng.
This can be good for him.	Sena se ka ba molemo ho eena.
As they continue on their way.	Ha ba ntse ba tsoela pele ka tsela ea bona.
You get the idea.	O fumana mohopolo.
Maybe that would be better, though.	Mohlomong hoo ho ka ba molemo, leha ho le joalo.
There is no way to pass.	Haho tsela ea ho feta.
I can't call.	Ha ke khone ho letsetsa.
Thank you for your great work.	Kea le leboha ka mosebetsi oa lona o moholo.
I was not sure what it was.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ke eng.
Many people felt very happy.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba ikutloa ba thabile haholo.
I had seen it.	Ke ne ke e bone.
It obviously did.	Ho hlakile hore e entse joalo.
And not much time.	Mme haho nako e ngata.
That stand seemed difficult.	Ho ema hoo ho ne ho bonahala ho le thata.
He says it sometimes takes until you are in your thirties.	O re ka linako tse ling ho nka ho fihlela u le lilemo li mashome a mararo.
I was just beginning to believe it.	Ke ne ke qala ho e lumela.
Some people are leaving.	Batho ba bang baa tsamaea.
Otherwise, he likes to walk around it.	Ho seng joalo, o rata ho tsamaea haufi le eona.
Now the situation is difficult.	Hona joale boemo bo thata.
This was not a school.	Sena e ne e se sekolo.
Of course, it is a very good thing.	Ehlile, ke ntho e ntle haholo.
This is a lot and it is no longer the case.	Sena se ngata mme ha se sa le joalo.
That's the way it is.	Ke kamoo ho leng kateng.
Yes, of course, you do not have to say it.	E, ho hlakile, ha ua tlameha ho e bua.
He likes to do that.	O rata ho etsa seo.
I used to tell my mom, and she would come out.	Ke ne ke ee ke bolelle ’mè oa ka, ’me o ne a tsoa.
He seemed better for it.	O ne a bonahala a le betere bakeng sa eona.
Time seemed to be an issue.	Nako e ne e bonahala e se ea bohlokoa ho hang.
That was the best.	Eo e ne e le eona e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
I'm done.	Ke qetile.
I thought he was more than he looked.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o feta kamoo o neng o bonahala kateng.
The food was delicious.	Lijo li ne li le monate.
Maybe this is the way to do it.	Mohlomong ena ke eona tsela ea ho e etsa.
He cried until he fell asleep.	A lla ho fihlela a robala.
About you I am very sorry.	Ka uena ke masoabi haholo.
Many people came in.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba kena.
I have always felt that life is important.	Haesale ke ikutloa hore bophelo ke ba bohlokoa.
It is also something you need to know.	Hape ke ntho eo u lokelang ho e tseba.
He could not drive.	O ne a sa khone ho khanna.
It is hard work.	Ke mosebetsi o boima.
If not, go and do it.	Haeba ho se joalo, e ea e etsa.
It must have been so if he thought so.	E tlameha ebe ho joalo haeba a ne a nahana joalo.
I mean their child.	Ke bolela ngoana oa bona.
He stopped and looked at the picture.	O ile a ema eaba o sheba setšoantšo seo.
The most delicious food.	Lijo tse monate ka ho fetisisa.
They are no longer in a position.	Ha ba sa na boemo.
Fun reading.	Ho bala monate.
I can ride, drive, and handle.	Ke khona ho li palama, ho khanna le ho li tšoara.
But gaining power will not be easy.	Empa ho fumana matla ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
If he left her now, she would be empty.	Haeba a ne a ka mo tlohela hona joale, o ne a tla be a se na motho.
He sees this.	O bona sena.
He needed her.	O ne a mo hloka.
And they were there.	Mme ba bile teng.
See what he has.	Bona seo a nang le sona.
If you have ever been.	Haeba u kile ua.
You just want to look.	U batla feela ho sheba.
We understand him now you can do that.	Re mo utloisisa hona joale u ka etsa joalo.
He thought he might be able to do it.	O ne a nahana hore mohlomong a ka e etsa.
But that's not my way.	Empa ha se tsela ea ka eo.
There is no way.	Haho tsela.
I'm not a kid, you know.	Ha ke ngoana, ua tseba.
Probably still so.	Mohlomong ho ntse ho le joalo.
He is not sure what the real thing is.	Ha a na bonnete ba hore na ntho ea sebele ke efe.
They will not be there.	Ba ka se be teng.
It would have been so important.	E ka be e bile ea bohlokoa hakaalo.
However, not all of them are.	Leha ho le joalo, hase kaofela ha bona.
I need to get back to work.	Ke hloka ho khutlela mosebetsing.
He did not want to talk to anyone.	O ne a sa batle ho bua le mang kapa mang.
It is not a one-man show.	Ha se mohopolo oa monna a le mong.
Think about this for a moment.	Nahana ka sena ho se hokae.
He needs that today.	O hloka seo kajeno.
It now works well.	Hona joale e sebetsa hantle.
We will understand this.	Re tla utloisisa sena.
But that is what my teacher told me to do.	Empa ke seo tichere ea ka e ileng ea mpolella hore ke se etse.
We must use some of your money to help.	Re tlameha ho sebelisa e 'ngoe ea chelete ea hau ho thusa.
It is also a day of the week.	Hape ke letsatsi la beke.
I did not tell anyone what was happening.	Ha kea ka ka bolella motho se etsahalang.
You can sleep here, if you wish.	U ka robala mona, ha u lakatsa.
The more things, the better.	Ha lintho tse ngata, ho molemo.
I would like to tell you about them.	Ke rata ho le bolella ka tsona.
It helps to know that entry.	Hoa thusa ho tseba hore ho kena.
I open it vigorously.	Ke e bula ka matla.
How time goes with friends.	Nako e tsamaea joang le metsoalle.
He said he could no longer work here.	A re ha a sa khona ho sebetsa mona.
I don't think so.	Ke nahana hore ha ho joalo.
And thank you for your feedback.	'Me ke leboha maikutlo a hau.
I wanted to do it now.	Ke ne ke batla ho e etsa hona joale.
There have been many good and bad ones.	Ho bile le tse ngata tse ntle le tse mpe.
The writing style was just great.	Mokhoa oa ho ngola o ne o le motle feela.
That is true, like it or not.	Seo ke 'nete, ho rata kapa che.
We do not want problems.	Ha re batle mathata.
They don't know.	Ha ba tsebe.
We had a wonderful day.	Re bile le letsatsi le monate.
We suspect a certain man.	Re belaela monna ea itseng.
He will never find it again.	Ha a sa tla hlola a e fumana.
The man decided to retire.	Monna eo o ile a etsa qeto ea ho tlohela mosebetsi.
I am an only child.	Ke ngoana a le mong.
We would do it again.	Re ne re tla e etsa hape.
Before that everything was working fine.	Pele ho moo tsohle li ne li sebetsa hantle.
Of course, we have done this before.	Ehlile, re kile ra etsa sena pele.
However, here they are.	Leha ho le joalo, ke tsena.
We did what we wanted to do.	Re ile ra etsa seo re neng re se batla.
Yes, he did.	E, o ile a etsa joalo.
Start the call.	Qala mohala.
I need to do something about it.	Ke hloka ho etsa ho hong ka eona.
Nice and nice place.	Sebaka se setle le se setle.
And she really liked that.	Mme o ne a rata seo haholo.
For the second, we use.	Bakeng sa ea bobeli, re sebelisa.
We would love to see you.	Re tla thabela ho o bona.
True, it refers to someone else.	Ke 'nete, e bua ka motho e mong.
But it is never his phone.	Empa ha se mohala oa hae le ka mohla.
Instead use the name of one group.	Ho e-na le hoo sebelisa lebitso la sehlopha se le seng.
Just watching it.	Ho o shebella feela.
Such a person does not look like that.	Motho ea joalo ha a bonahale joalo.
His clothes were miserable.	Liaparo tsa hae li ne li le masoabi.
Try again.	Leka hape.
Without you, it would not be possible.	Ntle le uena, ho ke ke ha etsahala.
It is their opinion.	Ke maikutlo a bona.
He will write soon.	O tla ngola haufinyane.
He stopped.	A ema.
That was for other days.	Seo e ne e le sa matsatsi a mang.
I did not look at the others.	Ha kea ka ka sheba ba bang.
It was the man's dog.	E ne e le ntja ya monna eo.
He wanted me to leave.	O ne a batla hore ke tsamaee.
But he was able to talk to her again.	Empa o ile a khona ho bua le eena hape.
They both want to see him more.	Ka bobeli ba batla ho mo bona haholo.
So he started walking.	Kahoo a qala ho tsamaea.
We had a few of us.	Re ne re e-na le tse seng kae rōna.
They feel hard.	Ba utloa ka thata.
We enjoyed good food.	Re ne re thabela lijo tse monate.
It certainly would not be mine.	Ka sebele e ne e ke ke ea e-ba ba ka.
I can't reach it.	Ha ke khone ho e fihlela.
That's a bad thing.	Ke ntho e mpe eo.
It comes out for you.	E tsoa bakeng sa hau.
You make it seem easy.	U etsa hore e bonahale e le bonolo.
My school had the same rule.	Sekolo sa ka se ne se e-na le molao o tšoanang.
He said it was his idea.	A re ke mohopolo wa hae.
They're passing by.	Ba ntse ba feta.
I did not hear anything.	Ha kea ka ka utloa letho le leng.
What did not happen.	Se sa kang sa etsahala.
It's not that easy.	Ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
They seemed to have the most important things to do.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ba fumane lintho tsa bohlokoa haholo tseo ba ka li etsang.
Mostly, of course.	Haholo, ha e le hantle.
Then amazing things happened.	Eaba ho qala ho etsahala lintho tse makatsang.
My car will never start again.	Koloi ea ka ha e sa tla qala.
A strong situation.	Boemo bo matla.
I can't stay here.	Ha ke khone ho lula mona.
He talks a lot.	O bua haholo.
He often does things like this.	Hangata o etsa lintho tse kang tsena.
Well, just wait.	Hantle, ema feela.
Many people would come.	Ho ne ho tla tla batho ba bangata.
She is not sure.	Ha a na bonnete.
To me it doesn't seem enough.	Ho 'na ha a bonahale a lekana.
Nothing to like.	Haho seo o se ratang.
That is what we are.	Ke seo re leng sona.
It's a good job we're here.	Ke mosebetsi o motle ha re le mona.
Now, he could swim.	Jwale, a ka ya sesa.
You should visit him at another time.	U lokela ho mo etela ka nako e 'ngoe.
I wear them every day.	Ke li apara letsatsi le leng le le leng.
Or he simply did not care what he said.	Kapa o ne a sa tsotelle seo a se buang.
You know him better than anyone else.	U mo tseba ho feta mang kapa mang.
The woman was alive.	Mosali eo o ile a phela.
It was a long time before he came for me.	Ho ile ha feta nako e telele pele a tla bakeng sa ka.
I will not do this with you.	Ha ke tlo etsa sena le uena.
But we caught it quickly.	Empa re ile ra e tšoara kapele.
You get one.	U fumana e le 'ngoe.
People enjoy traveling.	Batho ba thabela ho tsamaea.
In fact, there is nothing like him.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho letho le tšoanang le eena.
Some refused.	Ba bang ba ne ba hana.
Now he was alone, walking.	Joale o ne a se a le mong a bile a tsamaea ka maoto.
I know.	Kea tseba.
She cried for hours every day.	O ne a lla ka lihora tse ngata letsatsi ka leng.
He comes into my room a lot.	O tla ka kamoreng ea ka haholo.
I think she needs someone to take care of her.	Ke nahana hore o hloka motho ea tla mo hlokomela.
Write things down.	Ngola lintho fatše.
He would do it.	O ne a tla e etsa.
That is a valid question.	Ke potso ea 'nete.
He had no reason to fear us.	O ne a se na lebaka la ho re tšaba.
I'm so tired.	Ke khathetse hore.
No need to talk too long.	Ha ho hlokahale ho bua nako e telele.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
This is hard work.	Ona ke mosebetsi o boima.
He wanted to play.	O ne a batla ho bapala.
This can be a problem.	Sena se ka ba bothata.
But they are also dangerous.	Empa le tsona li kotsi.
It is not an easy task.	Ha se mosebetsi o bonolo.
I decided to let her go.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho mo tlohela.
Take on this one that you love.	Nka ho sena seo u se ratang.
He loves her very much.	O mo rata haholo.
Do all you can.	Etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang.
It seemed weird.	Ho ne ho bonahala e le ntho e makatsang.
That is how we came to be.	Ke kamoo re etsahetseng kateng.
The second mother of.	'Mè oa bobeli oa.
That is not the case.	Ha se taba eo.
However, more often than not.	Leha ho le joalo, hangata ke eena.
But that is the way life is.	Empa ke kamoo bophelo bo leng kateng.
That seems good.	Hoo ho bonahala ho le molemo.
He said nothing.	Ha a ka a bua letho.
He certainly does not know.	Ka sebele ha a tsebe.
So hair comes from what is not hair.	Ka hona moriri o tsoa ho seo e seng moriri.
They did not finish anything.	Ha ba ka ba qeta letho.
And that man, they know what they are.	Mme monna eo, ba tseba seo ba leng sona.
He does well only on his own.	O etsa hantle feela a le mong.
Some login details are not visible.	Litaba tse ling tsa ho kena ha li bonahale.
That was one rule.	Eo e ne e le molao o le mong.
They do this by playing with their strength.	Ba etsa sena ka ho bapala ka matla a bona.
I know exactly what happened.	Ke tseba hantle se etsahetseng.
And here it is.	Mme ke ena.
It will be good for me.	Ho tla ba molemo ho nna.
That should be simple.	Seo se lokela ho ba bonolo.
And he might enjoy that.	Mme mohlomong a ka thabela seo.
Every day, people ask for help.	Letsatsi le letsatsi, batho ba bangata ba ntse ba kōpa thuso.
We do not know where we are now.	Ha re tsebe moo re leng teng hona joale.
She was really fun.	O ne a hlile a le monate.
In fact, everything happens at the same time.	Ha e le hantle, ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe e etsahala ka nako e le ’ngoe.
And that is what you want.	Mme ke seo o se batlang.
I have a baby.	Ke na le ngoana.
It was hard.	Ho ne ho bile thata.
I still trust people.	Ke ntse ke tšepa batho.
I was visible.	Ke ne ke bonahala.
So, you will have to try harder.	Kahoo, u tla tlameha ho leka ka matla ho feta.
Both are present.	Ka bobeli a leng teng.
I could not understand it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e utloisisa.
Just think this way!	Nahana feela ka tsela ena!
However, I knew my mother.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke tseba 'Mè.
In the morning we will be gone.	Hoseng re tla be re ile.
Do we need to talk more?	Na re hloka ho bua ho feta?
We need them.	Re ba hloka.
I try every day.	Ke leka letsatsi le letsatsi.
People need to know that this is coming.	Batho ba lokela ho tseba hore ho tla mona.
We have heard wonderful things about him.	Re utloile lintho tse monate ka eena.
He's trying to get to you.	O leka ho fihla ho wena.
I just passed this with my son.	Ke sa tsoa feta sena le mora oa ka.
He too can do difficult things.	Le eena a ka etsa lintho tse thata.
I've been waiting for you.	esale ke o emetse.
I didn't say anything, of course.	Ha ke a bua letho, ehlile.
So stop telling people that they are.	Kahoo tlohela ho bolella batho hore ba joalo.
I needed a tool.	Ke ne ke hloka sebetsa.
Start with something you know.	Qala ka ntho eo u e tsebang.
I'll call tomorrow.	Ke tla letsa hosane.
We see their value.	Re bona bohlokoa ba tsona.
We live with it.	Re phela le eona.
We will do the same.	Le rona re tla etsa joalo.
He would not know what it was.	O ne a ke ke a tseba hore na ke eng.
It hurts so much to cry.	Ho bohloko haholo ho lla.
Not both.	Che ho bobeli.
He did not.	Ha a .
We have to go now.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea hona joale.
Only bad things.	Lintho tse mpe feela.
He could not continue his work.	Ha aa ka a khona ho tsoela pele ka mosebetsi oa hae.
I was coming back pretty well.	Ke ne ke khutla hantle hantle.
I had never been in any danger.	Ke ne ke e-s'o be kotsing leha e le efe.
They can see it and help us to see it.	Ba khona ho e bona le ho re thusa ho e bona.
I should never have told him.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho mo bolella le ka mohla.
That's exactly what you know.	Ke hantle haholo seo o se tsebang.
Real life.	Bophelo ba sebele.
In the morning they left together.	Hoseng ba tloha hammoho.
Every now and then, he would give a good and sweet impression.	Nako le nako, o ne a fana ka maikutlo a monate le a monate.
One tomorrow.	E 'ngoe hosane.
It seems to go either way.	Ho bonahala eka e ka ea ka tsela efe kapa efe.
If you do not think much of them, then you do not think.	Haeba u sa nahane haholo ka bona, joale ha u nahane.
And the possibility of more than the same.	Le monyetla oa ho feta tse tšoanang.
Then we ask ourselves questions.	Ebe joale re ipotsa lipotso.
We kept him until the letter of the law.	Re ile ra mo boloka ho fihlela lengolo la molao.
Someone knows.	E mong oa tseba.
And that's weird.	'Me ke ntho e makatsang.
But perhaps he is not.	Empa mohlomong ha a joalo.
He was glad to hear from me.	O ile a thabela ho utloa ho tsoa ho 'na.
However, it is.	Leha ho le joalo, ho joalo.
I do not know what you are talking about.	Ha ke tsebe hore na u bua ka eng.
I would be able to do that once again tonight.	Ke ne ke tla khona ho etsa joalo hang hape bosiung bona.
These people love to live a simple life and love to enjoy life.	Batho bana ba rata bophelo ba ho lula feela 'me ba rata ho thabela bophelo.
He has no power.	Ha a na matla.
This works very well.	Sena se sebetsa hantle haholo.
Someone who knew very little about it people.	Motho ea neng a tseba hanyane ka lona batho.
I didn't like anything or wanted anything.	Ke ne ke sa rate letho kapa ke sa batle letho.
No, more than that.	Che, ho feta moo.
She said she feels very lonely.	O ile a re o ikutloa a le mong haholo.
We really should.	Ruri re lokela.
I have never met one of them.	Ha ke eso kopane le e mong wa bona.
I can no longer even write properly.	Ha ke sa khona le ho ngola hantle.
There have been good and bad things.	Ho bile le lintho tse ntle le tse mpe.
It cried.	E ile ea lla.
Please use common sense here.	Ka kopo sebelisa kelello mona.
It's your job now.	Ke mosebetsi wa hao hona jwale.
This is my question.	Ena ke potso ea ka.
We do nothing to them.	Ha re etse letho ho bona.
He was even older.	O ne a le moholo ho feta moo.
Of course, things are more difficult now.	Ha e le hantle, hona joale lintho li thata ho feta.
Things like that.	Lintho tse joalo.
I would stay again.	Ke ne ke tla lula hape.
He had nothing to say.	O ne a se a se na seo a ka se buang.
I did not take it.	Ha kea e nka.
Everyone has their own mind.	Motho e mong le e mong o na le kelello ya hae.
And the people did so.	Mme batho ba ile ba etsa jwalo.
I will be back soon.	Ke tla khutla haufinyane.
I did not think so.	Ke ne ke sa nahane joalo.
He was very nice.	O ne a le monate haholo.
I was not right.	Ke ne ke se hantle.
This is probably.	Ena ke mohlomong.
It is difficult to say why.	Ho thata ho bolela hore na ke hobane'ng ha e etsa joalo.
Maybe that's why.	Mohlomong ke ka lebaka leo.
And the dog, if they had it.	Le ntja, haeba ba ne ba e-na le eona.
It's hard.	Ke thata.
And many of them were beautiful.	'Me tse ngata tsa tsona li ne li le ntle.
We will consider both.	Re tla nahana ka bobeli.
Don't know? 	Ha o tsebe?
he says.	o re.
I have to go home.	Ke tlameha ho ea hae.
I saw some crying.	Ke ile ka bona ba bang ba lla.
We have something for each occasion.	Re na le ho hong bakeng sa nako e 'ngoe le ho hong bakeng sa nako e' ngoe.
I can't get out.	Ha ke khone ho tsoa.
We certainly did.	Ruri re ile ra etsa joalo.
Stop again, and understand.	Ema hape, 'me u utloisise.
Come back anytime.	Khutla neng kapa neng.
I really don't understand why.	Ruri ha ke utloisise hore na ke hobane’ng.
But we are passing.	Empa rea ​​feta.
He didn't have it now, but he would get it soon.	O ne a se na eona hona joale, empa o ne a tla e fumana haufinyane.
And now he was strong.	Mme jwale o ne a ena le matla.
You just wonder and help them wonder.	Ua ipotsa feela le ho ba thusa ho ipotsa.
It was a dog.	E ne e le ntja.
As in the picture.	Joalo ka setšoantšo.
However, this is possible.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se ka etsahala.
That's for that.	Ke bakeng sa seo.
We find they were not.	Re fumana ba ne ba se joalo.
They really liked that thing.	Ba ne ba hlile ba rata ntho eo.
And he really lived for us.	Mme ruri o ile a phela bakeng sa rona.
He did not need it.	O ne a sa e hloke.
That doesn't matter now.	Seo ha se na taba jwale.
The food was delicious.	Lijo li ne li le monate.
That has become our daily reality.	Seo e bile 'nete ea rona ea letsatsi le letsatsi.
But he didn't care what it was, or not.	Empa o ne a sa tsotelle hore na ke eng, kapa che.
They would be leaving soon.	Ba ne ba tla tsamaea haufinyane.
It works well, however it can be even more powerful.	E sebetsa hantle, leha ho le joalo e ka ba matla le ho feta.
He did not want you to know.	O ne a sa batle hore o tsebe.
I have homework.	Ke na le mosebetsi oa sekolo.
I'm glad they're new.	Ke thabela hore ebe li ncha.
He had never seen anything like it.	O ne a eso bone ntho e kang ena.
He found that hard.	O ile a fumana seo ka tsela e thata.
Then she felt the same way.	Eaba le eena o ikutloa joalo.
And this past year.	Le selemong sena se fetileng.
Comment.	Fana ka maikutlo.
This road is very dangerous.	Tsela ena e kotsi haholo.
You know what you're here for.	U tseba seo u leng mona ka sona.
He can't.	A ke ke.
He let her go.	A mo tlohela.
You don’t know how to walk properly or anything.	Ha u tsebe ho tsamaea hantle kapa eng kapa eng.
He made a suggestion.	O ile a etsa tlhahiso.
That's really nice.	Ke ntho e ntle ruri.
I gave her breakfast in the bedroom.	Ke ile ka mo fa lijo tsa hoseng ka kamoreng ea ho robala.
And for how long.	Le ka nako e kae.
Yes, the man is me.	E, monna ke 'na.
I am sure that will not be a problem.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore seo e ke ke ea e-ba bothata.
He could read her as a book.	O ne a khona ho mo bala joaloka buka.
I have never seen you look at such a picture.	Ha ke e-s'o bone u sheba setšoantšo se joalo.
I've been here a week.	Ke na le beke ke le ka mona.
It really hurts.	E hlile e bohloko.
He did not say it.	Ha a ka a e bua.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
To me, money is nothing.	Ho 'na, chelete ha se letho.
Something more than me.	Ho hong ho feta nna.
And this was nothing new.	'Me sena e ne e se ntho e ncha.
Do not overeat.	U se ke ua ja haholo.
That way is life.	Tsela eo ke bophelo.
I had to make a decision.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho etsa qeto.
It becomes powerful.	E ba matla.
I'm with you now.	Ke na le uena joale.
I know why you are here.	Kea tseba hore na ke hobane'ng ha u le mona.
The times were bad.	Nako e ne e le mpe.
He does a good job with them.	O etsa mosebetsi o motle le bona.
They knew we were there.	E ne e tseba hore re teng.
Then use the same power again.	Joale sebelisa matla a tšoanang hape.
She asked her husband that question.	O ile a botsa monna oa hae potso eo.
So he was able to achieve that.	Kahoo o ile a khona ho fihlela seo.
He loved this group.	O ne a rata sehlopha sena.
But he doesn't have time for this right now.	Empa ha a na nako ea sena hona joale.
He didn't look that way.	O ne a sa bonahale e le mofuta oo.
I didn’t think there was.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore ho na le.
It's hard to imagine that.	Ho thata ho nahana ka seo.
These looked good in this way.	Tsena li ile tsa bonahala li le ntle ka tsela ena.
That was not the case.	Ho ne ho se joalo.
We usually do this.	Hangata re etsa sena.
They were glad to hear the news.	Ba ile ba thabela ho utloa litaba tseo.
We would always be close.	Re ne re tla lula re le haufi.
Start with him.	Qala ka eena.
The human mind is one thing.	Maikutlo a motho ke ntho e le 'ngoe.
You are a better doctor.	U feta ngaka e ntle haholo.
It's not wrong.	Ha se phoso.
I have decided to have a second opinion.	Ke nkile qeto ea hore re be le maikutlo a bobeli.
It could have been there for years.	E ka be e bile moo ka lilemo tse ngata.
But you will not be able to hold this position for long.	Empa u ke ke ua tšoara boemo bona nako e telele.
By the way, it's very difficult.	Tsela, ho thata haholo.
It still does today.	E ntse e etsa le kajeno.
I didn't deserve it.	Ke ne ke sa lokela.
We should not look at the past too much.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho sheba nako e fetileng haholo.
We do not know how to do it.	Ha re tsebe mokhoa oa ho e etsa.
There are not many things we can talk about.	Ha ho na lintho tse ngata tseo re ka buang ka tsona.
Life is Beautiful.	Bophelo bo monate.
And every day.	Le letsatsi le letsatsi.
And boy, does it work.	Mme moshanyana, na e sebetsa.
Up to this book.	Ho fihlela buka ena.
It was delicious.	E ne e le monate haholo.
He could go.	O ne a ka ea.
We would love to hear from you.	Re ka thabela ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
That is very powerful.	Seo se matla haholo.
However, one thing about him.	Leha ho le joalo, ntho e le 'ngoe ka eena.
He helped them find clothes.	O ile a ba thusa ho fumana liaparo.
I can sleep some days.	Nka robala ka matsatsi a mang.
Think about which one.	Nahana hore na ke efe.
What made you want to learn it?	Ke eng e entseng hore u batle ho ithuta eona?
However, it is difficult to fix it.	Leha ho le joalo, ho thata ho e lokisa.
Do not find anyone who wants to go with me.	U se ke ua fumana motho ea batlang ho tsamaea le 'na.
Also, he probably is.	Hape, mohlomong o teng.
The police did so.	Mapolesa a ile a etsa joalo.
I hope so.	Ke tšepa hore ho joalo.
He never asked questions.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a botsa lipotso.
Thank you.	Kea leboha.
But my opinion is not mine.	Empa maikutlo a ka ke a ka.
There is no money in that.	Haho chelete ho seo.
Of course, he was there.	Ehlile, o ne a le teng.
Watch the time.	Sheba nako.
Anything they wanted they got.	Ntho leha e le efe eo ba neng ba e batla ba ne ba e fumana.
The food is good.	Lijo li ntle.
I looked.	Ke ile ka sheba.
An image is more than just an image.	Setšoantšo se feta feela setšoantšo.
.	.
I have a family and a school to take care of.	Ke na le lelapa le sekolo seo ke lokelang ho se hlokomela.
He made a suggestion.	O entse tlhahiso.
I know you think we don't understand.	Kea tseba u nahana hore ha re utloisise.
We were glad to hear that.	Re ile ra thabela ho utloa seo.
It really was that way.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le joalo.
I hope he will come soon.	Ke tšepa hore o tla tla kapele.
It's been thirty years.	E se e le lilemo tse mashome a mararo.
He knows that.	O tseba seo.
But forget that.	Empa lebala seo.
For no reason.	Ntle le lebaka.
He may be working out of books.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe o sebetsa ka ntle ho libuka.
Now think of that problem.	Joale nahana ka bothata boo.
That is what happened as time went on.	Ke sona se ileng sa etsahala ha nako e ntse e feta.
He spoke but never.	O ile a bua empa ha ho mohla.
Thank you very much.	Ke leboha haholo.
Well thank you.	Hantle kea leboha.
He was too much for everything.	O ne a le ngata haholo ho tsohle.
Something is needed, or not needed.	Ho hong hoa hlokahala, kapa ha ho hlokahale.
Thanks and I will use you again.	Kea leboha 'me ke tla u sebelisa hape.
We are here to help.	Re mona ho thusa.
That is where he would go today.	Ke hona moo a neng a tla ya teng kajeno.
We are human, and we need things.	Ke motho, 'me re hloka lintho.
But the truth is clear.	Empa 'nete e hlakile.
He is not.	Ha a joalo.
We start looking here and now.	Re qala ho sheba mona le hona joale.
There is a certain pattern.	Ho na le mokhoa o itseng.
That would be difficult.	Hoo ho ka ba thata.
That is not a problem.	Seo ha se bothata.
You hear it so much.	U e utloa haholo.
I decided to go alone.	Ke entse qeto ea ho tsamaea ke le mong.
But more was to come.	Empa lintho tse ling li ne li tla etsahala.
It really wasn't.	Ho ne ho hlile ho se joalo.
Now, he stood up.	Hona joale, a ema ka maoto.
There is nothing in it for him.	Ha ho letho ho eona bakeng sa hae.
Surely one must hear.	Ka sebele motho o tlameha ho utloa.
I don't see why he does that.	Ha ke bone hore na hobaneng o etsa joalo.
It works well here.	E sebetsa hantle mona.
We can't talk about that.	Re ka se bue ka seo.
It will make more sense.	Ho tla ba le kelello ho feta.
It is not dangerous.	Ha e kotsi.
I find that good.	Ke fumana seo se le setle.
What's your name?	Lebitso la hau ke mang?
Certainly not yet near.	Ka 'nete ha e sa le haufi.
Decide on the matter.	Etsa qeto ka taba eo.
I was not his.	Ke ne ke se oa hae.
I mean, think about who was in that group.	Ke bolela, nahana hore na ke mang ea neng a le sehlopheng seo.
Let's do it.	Ha re e etse.
I make more money than him.	Ke etsa chelete e ngata ho mo feta.
But then he understood.	Empa joale o ile a utloisisa.
I had a better idea, though.	Ke bile le mohopolo o betere, leha ho le joalo.
None of them came to nothing.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ileng a tla ho letho.
But he used it.	Empa o ile a e sebelisa.
He continued.	O ile a tsoela pele.
Most people work long hours here.	Batho ba bangata ba sebetsa lihora tse telele mona.
Like a man.	Joalo ka monna.
They were happy and cheerful.	Ba ne ba thabile ba bile ba thabile.
And no one has it.	'Me ha ho motho ea nang le eona.
This did nothing.	Sena ha sea ka sa etsa letho.
Surprisingly, it is not always a bad thing.	Ho makatsang ha se ntho e mpe kamehla.
Even when enough is easy.	Le ha ho lekana ho le bonolo.
They are sometimes arrested by the police.	Ba ntse ba tšoaroa ke mapolesa ka linako tse ling.
Then they came.	Eaba baa tla.
We love everything.	Re rata tsohle.
The mood was bad.	Maikutlo a ne a le mpe.
Everything seemed to be going well.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e bonahala e tsamaea hantle.
What they did.	Seo ba se entseng.
They say nothing.	Ha ba bue letho.
I beg anyone who can help.	Ke kopa mang kapa mang a ka thusa.
There is no other way to make money.	Ha ho mokhoa o mong oa chelete.
The reason is simple.	Lebaka le bonolo.
It was a fun party.	E ne e le mokete o monate.
Unless you have nothing.	Ntle le ha o na letho.
Here's how.	Mona ke kamoo .
Or he does not.	Kapa ha a etse joalo.
He needed to fix it.	O ne a hloka ho e lokisa.
These are the people around him right now.	Bana ke batho ba haufi le eena hona joale.
And that’s how you make money.	'Me ke kamoo u etsang chelete.
This is the last one.	Ena ke ea ho qetela.
It is possible that they did so sometimes when problems arose.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe ba ne ba etsa joalo ka linako tse ling ha mathata a qala.
This may all be the case.	E ka 'na eaba sena sohle ke sona.
That was a hard thing to deny.	Eo e ne e le ntho e thata ho e hana.
Everything was so much fun.	Tsohle li ne li le monate haholo.
Soon the school would start paying.	Haufinyane sekolo se ne se tla qala ho lefa.
He did not stop to think.	Ha a ka a ema ho nahana.
Of course, it will not say what can happen.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho na ho bolela se ka etsahalang.
Of course, it may be best to assume that you are not.	Ha e le hantle, ho ka ’na ha e-ba molemo ho nka hore ha u joalo.
It might have taken a week or more.	Mohlomong e ka be e nkile beke kapa ho feta.
That would be inappropriate.	Seo e tla be se sa lokela.
Of course, there are many questions.	Ha e le hantle, ho na le lipotso tse ngata.
I can't do anything about this.	Ha ke khone ho etsa letho ka sena.
You and your type.	Uena le mofuta oa hau.
She told me a lot about him.	O ile a mpolella lintho tse ngata ka eena.
That is our true benefit.	Seo ke molemo oa rona oa 'nete.
Why can't he let her go?	Ke hobane'ng ha a sa khone ho mo tlohela?
He’s probably the best player.	Mohlomong ke sebapali se hloahloa.
Stay in the present moment.	Dula nakong ya jwale.
It's as clear as the sun.	E hlakile joalo ka letsatsi.
We love them.	Rea ba rata.
When we are strong.	Ha re le matla.
We could go on and on.	Re ne re ka tsoela pele le pele.
But it's fun.	Empa ho monate.
She would like to sleep.	A ka rata ho robala.
Of course I will be back at the end.	Ehlile ke tla khutla qetellong.
He is right.	O bolela hantle.
Something like that happens.	Ntho ea mofuta oo e ea etsahala.
So will yours.	Le ya hao e tla ba jwalo.
Then decide which ones will look good together.	Ebe u etsa qeto ea hore na ke eng e tla shebahala e le ntle hammoho.
Not at all.	Ho hang.
It continues to this day.	E tsoela pele ho fihlela kajeno.
I think we were too late for that.	Ke nahana hore re ne re le morao haholo bakeng sa seo.
He has no real power.	Ha a na matla a sebele.
Thanks again for everything.	Ke leboha hape ka tsohle.
The same is true of the second.	Ho joalo le ka ea bobeli.
And every day that comes.	Le letsatsi le letsatsi le tlang.
Let things know you exist.	Etsa hore lintho li tsebe hore e teng.
Of course it is clear what happened.	Ehlile ho hlakile hore na ho etsahetseng.
Me at best.	'Na ka ho fetisisa.
It's still bad.	E ntse e le mpe.
Do it quickly, I got it! 	E etse kapele, ke e fumane!
that was close.	seo se ne se le haufi.
But who could see it.	Empa ke mang ea neng a ka e bona.
They don’t really think too much.	Ha ba hlile ha ba nahane haholo.
It used to be.	Ho kile ha ba joalo.
You have the most important job.	U na le mosebetsi oa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
That was not the case.	Ho ne ho se joalo.
He could not ask for their help so quickly.	O ne a sitoa ho kopa thuso ea bona kapele hakaalo.
It should be fun.	E lokela ho ba monate.
Things are moving fast.	Lintho li tsamaea kapele.
That's his name.	Ke lebitso la hae.
I watch them.	Kea ba shebella.
And no one.	Mme haho motho.
What is that? 	Ke eng hoo?
You just have to believe.	U hloka feela ho lumela.
he asked.	a botsa.
It is better than anything we have.	E betere ho feta eng kapa eng eo re nang le eona.
You will not have time.	U ke ke ua ba le nako.
He didn't talk to us, he didn't talk about his problems.	O ne a sa bue le rona, a sa bue ka mathata a hae.
That is what we would have to do.	Ke seo re neng re tla tlameha ho se etsa.
It's so much fun to watch.	Ho monate haholo ho shebella.
You have to try.	U tlameha ho leka.
He was happy.	O ne a thabile.
I am sure he will be with you soon.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o tla ba le uena haufinyane.
What it was, we do not know.	Hore na e ne e le eng, ha re tsebe.
Not a bad thing.	Ha se ntho e mpe.
He did not know what to do with such questions.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng ka lipotso tse joalo.
Nothing was happening.	Ho ne ho se letho le etsahalang.
It was close.	O ne o le haufi.
They only need three things.	Ba hloka lintho tse tharo feela.
No one had ever done this before.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a etsa sena pele.
Who knows better.	Ke mang ea tsebang hantle.
You will know when it starts to feel good again.	U tla tseba ha e qala ho ikutloa hantle hape.
But it is difficult to love the mind.	Empa ho thata ho rata kelello.
I will take care of her first.	Ke tla mo hlokomela pele.
It takes our time back.	Ho nka nako ea rona morao.
He did not come home.	Ha a ka a tla hae.
You will not have to pay this fee.	U ke ke ua tlameha ho lefa chelete ena.
He could only walk in the backyard, and we were there.	O ne a ka tsamaea feela sebakeng se ka morao, 'me re ne re le teng.
I have no power over you.	Ha ke na matla a hao.
And it just passed.	Mme e ile ya feta feela.
However, you usually did not need it.	Leha ho le joalo, hangata u ne u sa e hloke.
That seems unlikely.	Seo se bonahala se ke ke sa etsahala.
He never had the opportunity to learn from another.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba le monyetla oa ho ithuta ho o mong.
The first time they did it.	Lekhetlo la pele ba e etsa.
I still am.	Ke ntse ke le joalo.
It was near the front.	E ne e le haufi le ka pele.
But you lived with it.	Empa u ne u phela le eona.
I love it even more.	Ke se ke e rata le ho feta.
I wanted several kids.	Ke ne ke batla bana ba ’maloa.
I will tell the doctor.	Ke tla e bolella ngaka.
We had to learn.	Re ne re lokela ho ithuta.
That is the reason for your mistake.	Ke lona lebaka la phoso ya hao.
I did not expect that to happen.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore ho be jwalo.
They learn it in school.	Ba e ithuta sekolong.
It is a book that was heavy.	Ke buka e neng e le boima.
What they did to the child.	Seo ba se entseng ho ngoana.
And maybe that was my fault.	'Me mohlomong eo e ne e le phoso ea ka.
That did not happen to me.	Seo se ne se sa etsahala ho 'na.
If anyone can do it, they can do it.	Haeba mang kapa mang a ka e etsa, a ka e etsa.
It took time for people to do that.	Ho ile ha feta nako pele batho ba etsa joalo.
I hope you can drive.	Ke tšepa hore u ka khanna.
I do not know how he managed.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o ile a khona joang.
I can see why people did not like it.	Kea bona hore na ke hobane'ng ha batho ba ne ba sa e rate.
It's that simple too.	Ho bonolo joalo hape.
And this is very painful.	Mme hona ho bohloko haholo.
You know who's going to have it.	U tseba hore na ke mang ea tla ba le eona.
No, he did not.	Che, ha aa ka a lumela.
If you want to be.	Haeba u batla ho ba.
I do not understand the question.	Ha ke utloisise potso.
Let's just forget about it.	Ke re re se ke ra lebala ka eona feela.
And then it was gone.	Mme ebe e ile.
However, he is able to write books.	Leha ho le joalo, o khona ho ngola libuka.
I always win.	Ke hlola ka nako tsohle.
Doctor save.	Ngaka boloka .
He did that tonight.	O entse seo bosiung bona.
He found nothing good.	O ne a sa fumane letho le molemo.
His work is the most important.	Mosebetsi oa hae ke oa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
Do not sleep at work.	U se ke ua robala mosebetsing.
Talk about it.	Ho bua ka eona.
My condition.	Boemo ba ka.
I'm just here drinking.	Ke mona feela ke ntse ke noa.
People were wearing their everyday clothes.	Batho ba ne ba apere liaparo tsa bona tsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
I mean they do it all at once.	Ke bolela hore ba e etsa ka nako e le 'ngoe.
He was looking from girl to girl.	O ne a sheba ho tloha ho ngoanana e mong ho ea ho e mong.
However, the real thing was not the issue.	Leha ho le joalo, ntho ea sebele e ne e se eona taba.
No, he was not.	Che, o ne a se joalo.
You do not like work.	Ha o rate mosebetsi.
That was exactly what we needed.	E ne e le sona seo re neng re se hloka.
Many could not.	Ba bangata ha baa ka ba khona.
Soon they will look for you here too.	Haufinyane ba tla u batla le mona.
I was very tired.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo.
Last night.	Bosiu bo fetileng.
I had spent years trying to work with them.	Ke ne ke qetile lilemo ke leka ho sebetsa le bona.
I just cried and cried.	Ke ne ke lla feela ke lla.
But we are good at what we do.	Empa re hantle ho seo re se etsang.
I do not know if we will have tomorrow.	Ha ke tsebe hore na re tla ba le hosane.
I love that first week of school.	Ke rata beke eo ea pele ea sekolo.
Do your homework now!	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau oa sekolo hona joale!
I would have to stop.	Ke ne ke tla tlameha ho ema.
You know what it is.	Ua tseba hore na ke eng.
I did not find anything.	Ha kea ka ka fumana letho.
There is also coffee.	Ho na le kofi hape.
There is no time for that.	Haho nako ya seo.
I can't do it right now.	Ha ke khone ho etsa hona joale.
But my hands were empty.	Empa matsoho a ka a ne a se na letho.
Have more.	Eba le lintho tse ngata.
I'm so scared of it.	Ke e tšaba haholo.
Shouldn’t you have bought?	Na u ne u sa lokela ho reka?
He probably expected this to happen every day from then on.	Mohlomong o ne a lebeletse hore sena se tla etsahala letsatsi le leng le le leng ho tloha ka nako eo.
It was not mine.	E ne e se ba ka.
This will ensure that they do not do any of these things.	Sena se tla etsa bonnete ba hore ha ba etse e 'ngoe ea lintho tsena.
It is very dangerous.	E kotsi haholo.
It was hard to say though.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bua leha ho le joalo.
And what is your name ?.	Mme lebitso la hao ke?.
The morning came.	Hoseng ha fihla.
All life is precious to us.	Bophelo bohle ke ba bohlokoa ho rona.
He is the most important person in the area.	Ke motho oa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa sebakeng.
We can tell them as soon as we see them.	Re ka ba bolella hang feela ha re ba bona.
It can never know for sure.	Ha ho mohla e ka tsebang hantle.
In the end, everyone was there.	Qetellong, bohle ba ne ba le teng.
It was a wonderful night.	E ne e le bosiu bo monate.
No man stayed long.	Ha ho monna ea ileng a lula nako e telele.
Maybe they did.	Mohlomong ba ile ba etsa joalo.
Now this house.	Jwale ntlo ena.
You can let it go.	U ka e tlohela.
Although he could try, he could not drink it all.	Le hoja a ne a ka leka, o ne a sitoa ho e noa kaofela.
It was not necessary.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale.
He was powerless.	O ne a sena matla.
I can't let you go any further.	Ha ke khone ho u lumella ho feta.
But it was dangerous.	Empa e ne e le kotsi.
Everything should be very simple.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e lokela ho ba bonolo haholo.
Certainly not a man of e.	Ka sebele e ne e se monna oa e.
You have to fix that.	O lokela ho lokisa taba eo.
He was done with everything now.	O ne a qetile ka tsohle jwale.
This was not my place.	Sena e ne e se sebaka sa ka.
Which is the best to use.	Ke efe e molemo ka ho fetisisa ho e sebelisa.
So we're done.	Ka hona re qetile.
Do you understand why he did this?	Na ua utloisisa hore na ke hobane’ng ha a entse see?
It came back to him.	E ile ea khutlela ho eena.
No one should come in or go out.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho kena kapa ho tsoa.
Someone who was asking for help very late.	Motho ea neng a kopa thuso morao haholo.
They will not go back.	Ba ke ke ba khutlela morao.
Mine was the first one.	Ea ka e bile ea pele.
Many people see the truth.	Batho ba bangata ba bona 'nete.
Of course it does not.	Ha e le hantle ha e eo.
I just got out.	Ke sa tsoa tsoa.
They did not, but still.	Ha ba ka ba etsa joalo, empa leha ho le joalo.
We love them, and they love us.	Rea ba rata, le bona baa re rata.
I can do the same.	Le 'na nka etsa joalo.
Never say this to another group.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua bua sena ho sehlopha se seng.
I have to try to stop.	Ke lokela ho leka ho ema.
I try to keep other people happy with me.	Ke leka ho boloka batho ba bang ba thabile le ’na.
It came out right today.	E ne e tsoa hantle kajeno.
It memorizes you.	E u tšoara ka hlooho.
However, there was something wrong.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le ntho e itseng.
He spoke a little about that.	O ile a bua hanyane ka seo.
That is his decision.	Ke qeto ya hae.
The party will pass last night.	Mokete o tla feta oa bosiu bo fetileng.
We're glad to have you this week.	Re thabetse ho ba le uena bekeng ena.
It was more than that.	E ne e feta moo.
He sang while working.	O ne a bina ha a ntse a sebetsa.
I think it is clear what is there.	Ke nahana hore ho hlakile hore na ho na le eng moo.
And it is not necessary.	Mme ha ho hlokahale.
More time than we have.	Nako e ngata ho feta eo re nang le eona.
But you do not have to.	Empa ha ho hlokahale hore u etse joalo.
It's beautiful.	E ntle.
Probably very good.	Mohlomong e ntle haholo.
We must save energy.	Re tlameha ho boloka matla.
Probably a certain way.	Mohlomong tsela e itseng.
It was just too much.	E ne e le ngata haholo feela.
I am, just right, a tough team.	Ke, hantle feela, sehlopha se thata.
We studied together.	Re ne re ithuta hammoho.
All these years and ages.	Lilemo tsena tsohle le lilemo.
That's the problem.	Ke bothata boo.
We went to the room together.	Re ile ra ea kamoreng hammoho.
To me it seems both important.	Ho 'na ho bonahala eka bobeli ke ba bohlokoa.
Food was more important than anything else and very important for money.	Lijo e ne e le tsa bohlokoa ho feta tse ling hape e le tsa bohlokoa haholo bakeng sa chelete.
If it was dangerous, it happens a lot.	Haeba e ne e le kotsi, e etsahala haholo.
I really mean that.	Ke hlile ke bolela seo.
It would just be a matter of finding out what it is.	E ne e tla ba taba feela ea ho fumana hore na ke eng.
That must be strange to him.	Seo e tlameha ebe ke ntho e makatsang ho eena.
Which, of course, would not be so.	E leng hore, ehlile, a ka be a se jwalo.
I think one of them came in.	Ke nahana hore e mong wa bona o ile a kena.
Well, he was there.	Be, o ne a le teng.
I am a doctor .	Ke ngaka .
We are tired of walking.	Re khathetse ke ho tsamaea.
But some things do not come together.	Empa lintho tse ling ha li kopane.
It will work well on it.	E tla sebetsa hantle ho eona.
The food is not delicious.	Lijo ha li monate.
We will not leave you.	Re ke ke ra u tlohela.
Some days are fun.	Matsatsi a mang a monate.
They say it happens a little more often than before.	Ba re e etsahala hangata hanyane ho feta pele.
She was a mother.	E ne e le mme.
So you have no idea how we really feel.	Kahoo ha u tsebe hore na re hlile re ikutloa joang.
It has taken a very long time.	Nako e telele e nkile nako e telele haholo.
He looked at her, learning about her.	O ile a mo sheba, a ithuta ka eena.
The phone is always ringing.	Mohala o lula o lla.
That didn't matter.	Seo se ne se sa tsotelle.
I'm sure he'll be back.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o tla khutla.
There was plenty of food to think about.	Ho ne ho e-na le lijo tse ngata tsa ho nahana.
He has something behind him.	O na le se seng ka mora hae.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
I also read it.	Le eona ke ile ka e bala.
I mean we can.	Ke bolela hore re ka khona.
It was difficult but not impossible.	Ho ne ho le thata empa e se ntho e ka etsahalang.
He was not a man.	E ne e se motho.
He lives at home now.	O lula hae hona joale.
Does anyone know how to play? 	Na ho na le motho ea tsebang ho bapala?
he asked.	a botsa.
She looked happy.	O ne a shebahala a thabile.
He asked what would make life better.	O ile a botsa hore na ke eng e neng e tla etsa hore bophelo bo be monate.
And this was now.	Mme sena se ne se le teng jwale.
You have been here.	U bile mona.
I love my life as it is.	Ke rata bophelo ba ka kamoo bo leng kateng.
Then it might be best to think about it.	Joale mohlomong ho tla ba molemo ho nahana ka eona.
Of course, you have to keep doing what you were doing.	Ha e le hantle, u tlameha ho tsoela pele ho etsa seo u neng u ntse u se etsa.
But it is the book we need.	Empa ke buka eo re e hlokang.
He could not start a second time.	O ne a sa khone ho qala ka lekhetlo la bobeli.
And then he goes home.	Mme ebe o ya hae.
Have you ever done.	Na u kile ua etsa.
You can't refuse.	U ke ke ua hana.
It does not matter to him.	Ha ho na taba ea hae.
That's how he loved it.	Ke kamoo a neng a e rata kateng.
It happens all the time.	E etsahala nako le nako.
He always comes back to help with the day's work.	O lula a khutla ho tla thusa ka mosebetsi oa letsatsi.
But really, only this is where this matters.	Empa ha e le hantle, ke feela moo sena se leng bohlokoa.
I took it to mean something.	Ke ile ka e nka e bolela ho hong.
Go back to sleep.	Khutlela ho robala.
What he knew now was pain.	Seo a neng a se tseba joale ke bohloko.
We will trust in our own strength and power.	Re tla tšepa matla a rona le matla a rona.
He was about the same age as me.	O ne a batla a lekana le nna.
I do not know how.	Ha ke tsebe joang.
Yet strange.	Leha ho le joalo e makatsang.
He will not let anyone think he has found it.	A ke ke a lumella mang kapa mang ho nahana hore o e fumane.
He thought so.	O ile a nahana joalo ka taba eo.
Where do you find the time ?.	O fumana nako hokae?.
They just do.	Ba etsa feela.
He thought.	O ne a nahana.
This would be fun.	Sena se ne se tla ba monate.
I did this year.	Ke entse selemong sena.
Does this help?	Na see sea thusa?
He had never asked if it was necessary.	O ne a e-s'o ka a botsa hore na hoa hlokahala.
Probably all.	Mohlomong tsohle.
Of course that's the reason.	Ehlile ke lebaka.
It was the same with another man.	Ho bile joalo le ka monna e mong.
When he looked at her, he felt that he would never leave her, and he would never leave her.	Ha a mo sheba, o ne a ikutloa hore a ke ke a hlola a mo tlohela, le ka mohla a ke ke a mo tlohela.
This did not happen to me.	Sena ha se sa ka.
This is the last one.	Ena ke ea ho qetela.
I do not know if he will live.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o tla phela.
What happened is what happened.	Se etsahetseng ke sona se etsahetseng.
Here you can find everything.	Mona o ka fumana tsohle.
Either way, you have some really fun times.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe, o na le linako tse monate haholo.
I think that's a question, now.	Ke nahana hore ke potso, jwale.
I did not know whether to believe him or not.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke mo lumele kapa che.
Children usually start school at the age of three.	Hangata bana ba qala sekolo ha ba le lilemo li tharo.
I would never do such a thing.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa ntho e joalo.
I thought this method would work.	Ke ne ke nahana hore tsela ena e tla sebetsa.
And just water.	Le metsi feela.
My thoughts are mixed.	Maikutlo a ka a kopane.
It comes first in the family.	E tla pele ho lelapa.
He is dangerous.	O kotsi.
Obviously this is not what happened when the player spoke.	Ho hlakile hore sena ha se se etsahetseng ha sebapali se se bua.
They were not expecting anything in return.	Ba ne ba sa lebella letho le molemo.
You cannot be alone.	U ke ke ua ba mong.
I'd like to hear more.	Ke kopa ho utloa tse ling.
You can't open them.	U ke ke ua li bula.
And it's not bad.	'Me ha e mpe.
They are very bad.	Li mpe haholo.
And it was not my business.	Mme e ne e se taba ya ka.
Of course it was.	Ehlile ho ne ho le jwalo.
Many people suffer from poor eyesight.	Batho ba bangata ba na le bothata ba ho se bone hantle.
That's what it is.	Ke eona taba eo.
Maybe something from me.	Mohlomong ho hong ho tsoa ho 'na.
I want to talk a little with you.	Ke batla ho bua hanyane le uena.
He wants me to go too.	O batla hore le 'na ke tsamaee.
It was a wonderful evening.	E ne e le mantsiboea a monate.
I'm not sure what was going on with our team.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ho ne ho etsahala eng ka sehlopha sa rona.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you here.	Leha ho le joalo, ke thabela ho u bona mona.
They stayed up late.	Ba ile ba lula ka morao ho nako.
I also had a wonderful evening.	Le 'na ke bile le mantsiboea a monate.
However, it will be fun.	Leha ho le joalo, ho tla ba monate.
We both know it won't work.	Ka bobeli rea tseba hore e ke ke ea sebetsa.
It did not seem real.	E ne e sa bonahale e le ea sebele.
We bought everything we needed.	Re ile ra reka ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe eo re e hlokang.
He decided to quit his job.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho tlohela mosebetsi oa hae.
Forget the past, do not dwell on the past.	Lebala tse fetileng, u se ke ua lula u nahana ka tse fetileng.
Then he would walk into my room or his room.	Joale o ne a kena ka kamoreng ea ka kapa kamoreng ea hae.
He wants to get out, and he wants to get out now.	O batla ho tsoa, ​​'me o batla ho tsoa hona joale.
If not, it's too late to do anything about it.	Haeba e le che, ho se ho le morao haholo ho etsa letho ka eona.
He was too big for her.	O ne a le moholo haholo bakeng sa hae.
I hope they are.	Ke tšepa hore ba joalo.
He finally told me so.	Qetellong o ile a mpolella joalo.
Maybe you can help him?	Mohlomong u ka mo thusa?
You will probably have heard it.	Mohlomong u tla be u e utloile.
Now, one last chance.	Jwale, monyetla wa ho qetela.
Sometimes you forget all your problems.	Ka linako tse ling u lebala mathata a hao kaofela.
You need to find an important job.	U lokela ho fumana mosebetsi oa bohlokoa.
She was delicious.	O ne a le monate.
Or their shoes.	Kapa lieta tsa bona.
A simple mistake.	Phoso e bonolo.
They can enjoy delicious food.	Ba ka thabela lijo tse monate.
I buy a lot of books.	Ke reka libuka tse ngata.
And these people.	Mme batho ba.
We must read it.	Re tlameha ho e bala.
We talked for a while about this.	Re ile ra bua nako e itseng ka taba ena.
You can do that while we are with you.	U ka etsa joalo re ntse re e-na le uena.
In fact, the work did not seem to matter.	Ha e le hantle, mosebetsi ona o ile oa bonahala e se oa bohlokoa.
He seemed to know something.	Eka o ne a tseba ho hong.
None of them rode.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ileng a palama.
I needed him to be there for me.	Ke ne ke hloka hore a be teng bakeng sa ka.
We're sorry, too.	Re masoabi, le rona.
I can only give you a head start.	Nka u fa hlooho feela.
This is a strange thing.	Taba ena ke e makatsang.
The important thing is to do it.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore u e etse.
I have to finish my homework soon!	Ke tlameha ho qeta mosebetsi oa ka oa sekolo kapele!
There are others.	Ho na le tse ling.
I need it first.	Ke hloka pele.
He feels too early.	O ikutloa e sa le kapele haholo.
You should too.	Le uena u lokela ho etsa joalo.
Time is all you have.	Nako ke sohle seo u nang le sona.
What could happen.	Ho ka etsahala eng.
I wanted to keep writing a book.	Ke ne ke batla ho tsoela pele ho ngola buka.
His head was aching.	Hlooho ya hae e ne e le bohloko.
No, it was gone.	Che, e ne e ile.
More than that of someone you know.	Ho feta joalo ka motho eo u mo tsebang.
I wonder when it will start.	Kea ipotsa hore na e tla qala neng.
There were so many questions.	Ho ne ho e-na le lipotso tse ngata.
I still don't have one.	Ke ntse ke se na 'na.
The place here is very nice.	Sebaka sa mona se setle haholo.
The weapon rang and they stood up.	Sebetsa se ile sa lla ba ema ka maoto.
I'm tired.	Ke khathetse.
They are moving.	Ba ntse ba tsamaea.
You know, it's as simple as that.	Ua tseba, e bonolo joalo ka eona.
After that only once a week.	Ka mor'a moo hang feela ka beke.
I still had them.	Ke ne ke ntse ke e-na le tsona.
Of course not a problem.	Ehlile ha se bothata.
He wanted water, but he did not ask.	O ne a batla metsi, empa ha a ka a botsa.
What are you talking about.	O bua ka eng.
However, we need your help if we are to get there.	Leha ho le joalo, re hloka thuso ea hau haeba re tla fihla moo.
At one point, things seemed to be going from bad to worse.	Ka nako e itseng lintho li ne li bonahala li le mpe haholo.
It was bad, whatever it was.	E ne e le mpe, leha e ka ba eng.
It is no longer an easy matter to take that thing.	Ha e sa le taba e bonolo ea ho nka ntho eo.
He seemed to have trouble seeing it clearly.	O ne a bonahala a na le bothata ba ho e bona hantle.
So we will go back home to ask him.	Kahoo re tla khutlela hae ho ea mo botsa.
He would be equal to something.	O ne a tla lekana le ho hong.
I know what he wants me to say.	Ke tseba seo a batlang hore ke se bue.
This is what my reality will be.	Sena ke seo 'nete ea ka e tla ba sona.
One is very interesting.	E 'ngoe e monate haholo.
We can't find it, for one thing.	Re ke ke ra e fumana, bakeng sa ntho e le 'ngoe.
Life is so simple.	Bophelo bo bonolo haholo.
I'm glad you're here.	Ke thabetse hore ebe o teng.
No one.	Ha ho motho.
Now, to begin with.	Jwale, ho qala.
But you can not imagine what it was like.	Empa u ke ke ua nahana hore na ho ne ho le joang.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
That’s what we need, in the area of ​​food.	Ke seo re se hlokang, sebakeng sa lijo.
You will find e.	O tla fumana e.
Meet them where they are.	Kopana le bona moo ba leng teng.
I hope and hope that it will not be so.	Kea tšepa le ho tšepa hore e ke ke ea e-ba joalo.
The hardest thing ever happened.	Ntho e thata ka ho fetisisa e kileng ea e-ba teng.
That was three years ago.	Ke lilemo tse tharo tse fetileng.
This was a lot of money.	Ena e ne e le chelete e ngata.
They helped her together.	Ba ile ba mo thusa hammoho.
She just wanted to help her son.	O ne a batla feela ho thusa mora oa hae.
You have to try hard.	U lokela ho leka ka matla.
The study time has been a long one.	Nako ea ho ithuta e bile nako e telele.
But that too can take years.	Empa le hoo ho nka lilemo.
The other group did not do any of those things.	Sehlopha se seng ha sea ka sa etsa letho la lintho tseo.
You are an important person.	U motho oa bohlokoa.
That had made it worthwhile.	Seo se ne se entse hore ho be le molemo.
Talking to her was not easy.	Ho bua le hona ho ne ho se bonolo.
We are a very close family.	Re lelapa le haufi haholo.
However, it can happen to anyone.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ka etsahala ho mang kapa mang.
It was bad enough.	E ne e le mpe ho lekana.
They thought that they would do the same.	Ba ne ba nahana hore le bona ba tla etsa joalo.
But they seem to like it.	Empa ho bonahala ba e rata.
Maybe that’s why our time was so fun.	Mohlomong ke ka lebaka leo nako ea rona e neng e le monate haholo.
We never did that again.	Ha rea ​​ka ra hlola re etsa joalo.
It is morning.	Ke hoseng.
She cried.	O ile a lla.
I can return to work in 30 days.	Nka khutlela mosebetsing ka mor'a matsatsi a mashome a mararo.
It no longer exists.	Ha e sa le teng.
I did not think so.	Ke ne ke sa nahane joalo.
They love these foods.	Ba rata lijo tsena.
Throughout your stay we offer a lot of simple things.	Nakong eohle ea ho lula ha hao re fana ka lintho tse ngata tse bonolo.
I said thank you.	Ka re kea leboha.
But it's easy.	Empa ho bonolo.
It is still night.	E ntse e le bosiu.
Very often.	Hangata haholo.
She has no hair.	Ha a na moriri.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
It costs a lot of money.	E lefa chelete e ngata haholo.
I knew where this was going.	Ke ne ke tseba hore na sena se ea hokae.
Here is a picture of my family.	Mona ke setšoantšo sa lelapa la ka.
To do anything with it.	Ho etsa eng kapa eng ka eona.
All he did was go home from school.	Sohle seo a neng a se etsa e ne e le ho ea hae a tsoa sekolong.
They would need an alternative.	Ba ne ba tla hloka tsela e 'ngoe.
The phone started ringing.	Mohala o ile oa qala ho lla.
Finally, someone was talking to her.	Qetellong, ho ne ho e-na le motho ea buang le eena.
That's what we do.	Ke seo re se etsang.
But not anymore, man.	Empa ha ho sa le joalo, monna.
That's just true.	Ke 'nete feela.
He too has done wonderful work.	Le eena o entse mosebetsi o makatsang.
If you are not one of them, so be it.	Haeba u se e mong oa bona, ho be joalo.
He gives it to those who do it.	O fana ka eona ho ba e etsang.
After the car, the children play.	Ka mor'a koloi, bana ba bapala.
It is too late to repair the house.	E se e le morao haholo ho lokisa ntlo.
I kept asking my mother what had happened, but she refused.	Ke ile ka ’na ka botsa ’Mè hore na ho etsahetse’ng, empa a hana.
Yet they have never been like that.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba joalo.
We do not understand them.	Ha re li utloisise.
It is not a real job.	Ha se mosebetsi oa sebele.
I can go with you.	Nka tsena le uena.
It was so beautiful.	E ne e le ntle haholo.
It is very difficult for all of us.	Ho boima haholo ho rona bohle.
There is nothing.	Haho letho.
Well, bedroom.	Hantle, kamore ea ho robala.
I did not know a single person.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe motho a le mong.
I did not know.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe.
Do you think that they can hear us?	Na u nahana hore ba ka re utloa?
They are real people.	Ke batho ba sebele.
We found that this method is very effective for the job.	Re fumane hore mokhoa ona o sebetsa haholo bakeng sa mosebetsi.
I would sing anywhere.	Ke ne ke tla bina kae kapa kae.
He finally did it.	Qetellong o e entse.
And he would do that.	Mme o ne a tla etsa jwalo.
Don't do that.	O seke wa etsa seo.
This was certainly not true.	Ka sebele sena e ne e se ’nete.
However, sometimes it is necessary.	Leha ho le joalo, ka linako tse ling hoa hlokahala.
I thought it was fun.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e monate.
They realize something like that.	Ba hlokomela ntho ea mofuta oo.
So he left alone to go to his parents.	Kahoo, o ile a tloha a le mong ho ea ha batsoali ba hae.
I do bad things.	Ke etsa lintho tse mpe.
I know his old family.	Ke tseba lelapa la hae la khale.
It was something they did.	E ne e le ntho eo ba e entseng.
All those years.	Lilemo tseo kaofela.
Do you have shoes?	O na le lieta?
Just realizing that.	Ho hlokomela seo feela.
I'm not saying there is no such situation.	Ha ke re ha ho boemo bo jwalo.
Just knowing what they are saying.	Ho tseba feela seo ba se buang.
You took us together.	U re nkile hammoho.
But this did not happen at all.	Empa sena ha sea ka sa etsahala ho hang.
We have life.	Re na le bophelo.
We continued walking.	Re ile ra tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
Do things for those in need.	Etsa lintho bakeng sa ba hlokang.
I can learn something from you.	Nka ithuta ho hong ho wena.
The second is, you are not.	Ea bobeli ke, le uena ha u joalo.
There is a reason for that.	Ho na le lebaka la seo.
He continued reading.	A tsoela pele ho bala.
Of course, I can't.	Ha e le hantle, nke ke ka khona.
He seemed to enjoy it.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka o ne a e thabetse.
You do not need it.	Ha o e hloke.
It seems very simple.	Ho bonahala ho le bonolo haholo.
I like it.	Ke a e rata.
That was a daunting task.	Mosebetsi oo e ne e le o boima.
I thought it was just yours.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke oa hau feela.
You can see that all the time.	U ka bona seo ka nako eohle.
I may have to do one day.	Nka tlameha ho etsa letsatsi le le leng.
Maybe it was a good thing, he was just passing by.	Mohlomong e ne e le ntho e ntle, o ne a ntse a feta.
We did things.	Re entse lintho.
There seems to be no one else.	Ho bonahala ho se motho e mong.
Space is nothing.	Sebaka ha se ntho.
We did what we had to do.	Re ile ra etsa seo re neng re lokela ho se etsa.
It was not a lot of money.	E ne e se chelete e ngata.
I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke mohopolo o motle kapa che.
Then she tells me her thoughts.	Ebe o mpolella maikutlo a hae.
I don't see a better place to do it.	Ha ke bone sebaka se betere ho e etsa.
I have trouble starting.	Ke na le bothata ba ho qala.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
We need to get out of this!	Re hloka ho tloha ho sena!
The same is true here.	Ho joalo le mona.
Of course in place.	Ehlile sebakeng.
And then our kids start playing together in high school.	'Me joale bana ba rona ba qala ho bapala hammoho sekolong se phahameng.
I want to read a book.	Ke batla ho bala buka.
We usually drink water.	Hangata re noa metsi.
I did not look at the others.	Ha kea ka ka sheba ba bang.
We are here.	Re ka mona.
He nodded to us both.	O ile a re kopa ka hlooho ka bobeli.
If there is something you want to say, move on.	Haeba ho na le seo u batlang ho se bua, tsoela pele.
I didn't say much today.	Ha ke a bua haholo kajeno.
I slept in my clothes.	Ke ne ke robala ka liaparo tsa ka.
You do not know what you will get.	Ha o tsebe hore na o tla fumana eng.
That's his thing.	Ke taba ea hae.
Yet there is room for suspicion.	Leha ho le joalo ho na le sebaka sa ho belaela.
He did not want that.	O ne a sa batle joalo.
He was a man for her.	E ne e le monna bakeng sa hae.
He never wanted this.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a batla sena.
They may even believe it.	Mohlomong ba bile ba e lumela.
They didn't do it in one place.	Ba ne ba sa e etse sebakeng se le seng.
And do it.	Mme o e etse.
Do not be like that.	U se ke ua ba joalo.
None of them wanted to leave.	Ho ne ho se le ea mong oa bona ea neng a batla ho tsamaea.
They don't know.	Ha ba tsebe.
He learns quickly.	O ithuta kapele.
Let's not eat that!	Ha re je seo!
The work was not difficult.	Mosebetsi e ne e se o boima.
I look down at my old shoes.	Ke sheba fatše lieta tsa ka tsa khale.
They actually lived by it.	Ha e le hantle ba ile ba phela ka eona.
We want to know what they did.	Re batla ho tseba hore na ba entseng.
And if he does not do it again, do not call for a week.	Mme ha a ka e etsa hape, o seke wa letsa beke.
However, there are other problems.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le mathata a mang.
It is important to us.	Ke oa bohlokoa ho rona.
You were expecting the worst, so you got it.	U ne u lebeletse tse mpe ka ho fetisisa, kahoo u li fumane.
Strange.	Tse makatsang.
Many people believe she is innocent.	Batho ba bangata ba lumela hore ha a na molato.
It is very easy to read it now.	Ho bonolo haholo ho e bala hona joale.
Both are beautiful.	Ka bobeli li ntle.
Like how hard it can be.	Joalo ka hore na ho ka ba thata hakae.
She was beautiful and handsome.	O ne a le motle a bile a le motle.
But that was not enough.	Empa hoo ho ne ho sa lekana.
These can happen.	Tsena li ka etsahala.
No one really knows why these things happen.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle hore na ke hobane’ng ha lintho tsena li etsahala.
Sometimes it is fun to live in this time.	Ka linako tse ling ho monate ho phela nakong ena.
I do not want to see anyone.	Ha ke batle ho bona motho.
So we stayed here.	Kahoo re ile ra lula mona.
He was reading the news.	O ne a bala litaba.
He could not think of that opportunity now.	O ne a sitoa ho nahana ka monyetla oo hona joale.
Today, almost everything does something other than what it does.	Kajeno, hoo e batlang e le ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e etsa ho hong ntle le seo e se etsang.
It was really fun.	E ne e hlile e le monate oa sebele.
This book will make going back to school fun.	Buka ena e tla etsa hore ho khutlela sekolong ho be monate.
I may never get there again.	Mohlomong nke ke ka hlola ke fihla moo.
He works with his people.	O sebetsa le batho ba hae.
It would be nice, maybe, if we could do that here.	Ho ka ba hantle, mohlomong, ha re ka etsa joalo mona.
And no one else has spoken to him.	Hape ha ho motho e mong eo a buileng le eena.
Nothing is more difficult.	Ha ho letho le boima ho feta.
He just loved people.	O ne a mpa a rata batho.
I was afraid to say anything.	Ke ne ke tšaba ho bua letho.
There seemed to be nothing at the time.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ha ho letho ka nako eo.
This place is not good.	Sebaka sena ha se setle.
It never tried.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea leka.
So, that's our situation.	Kahoo, ke boemo ba rona.
I didn't care.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle.
It's a fun, simple picture.	Ke setšoantšo se monate, se bonolo.
I've seen this.	Ke bone sena.
He knew they were useless.	O ne a tseba hore ha li na thuso.
Sometimes they even come with their friends.	Ka linako tse ling ba bile ba tla le metsoalle ea bona.
Because he is beautiful.	Hobane o motle.
It really isn't hard to do that.	Ho hlile ha ho thata ho etsa joalo.
He really wanted to drive, but he refused.	O ne a hlile a batla ho khanna, empa a hana.
She could hear him opening it.	O ne a mo utloa ha a bula.
It didn’t really matter, in the end, though.	Ho ne ho se taba hakaalo, qetellong, leha ho le jwalo.
I'm a little guilty.	Ke molato hanyane.
This is not the case.	Sena ha se sona.
You can use any of them you like.	U ka sebelisa leha e le efe ea tsona eo u e ratang.
It can happen.	Ho ka etsahala.
Help his father.	Thusa ntate oa hae.
Talk to me.	E bue le nna.
Well, now is the time now.	Be, joale ke nako ea joale.
The picture was of his son.	Setšoantšo seo e ne e le mora oa hae.
Also, decide if you will be able to do the job.	Hape etsa qeto ea hore na u tla khona ho etsa mosebetsi oo.
There were police.	Ho ne ho e-na le mapolesa.
It's good to be with you this morning.	Ho molemo ho ba le uena hoseng hona.
That task was too difficult for him.	Mosebetsi oo o ne o le boima haholo ho eena.
Yet you do.	Leha ho le joalo u etsa joalo.
He didn't care.	O ne a sa tsotelle.
This is not their job.	Sena ha se mosebetsi oa bona.
It is best to arrive early.	Ho molemo ho fihla kapele.
This can fix your problem.	Sena se ka lokisa bothata ba hau.
He would learn.	O ne a tla ithuta.
He was not wrong.	O ne a sa etsa phoso.
However, that did not happen.	Leha ho le joalo, seo ha sea ka sa ba teng.
We must help him.	Re tlameha ho mo thusa.
We are getting there.	Re ea fihla.
He has been making money for years.	O qetile lilemo a etsa chelete.
I really enjoyed that.	Ke ile ka thabela seo haholo.
An error would not have occurred.	Phoso e ka be e sa etsahala.
This is how they make money.	Ena ke tsela eo ba etsang chelete ka eona.
However, people will say what they want to say.	Leha ho le joalo, batho ba tla bua seo ba batlang ho se bua.
Of course you don’t think you’re doing it but you think.	Ha e le hantle u se ke ua nahana hore u etsa joalo empa u nahana.
A house as bad as his.	Ntlo e mpe joalo ka eena.
Otherwise, this is useless.	Ho seng joalo, sena ha se na thuso.
He has never seen anything.	Ha A eso bone letho.
Yet in ignorance.	Leha ho le joalo ka ho se tsebe.
Our mother asked.	'M'e oa rona o ile a botsa.
That is.	E leng hore.
It works great.	E sebetsa haholo.
We know him.	Rea mo tseba.
It's a bad thing to ask a girl.	Ke ntho e mpe ho botsa ngoanana.
The boy needed to hear something missing.	Moshanyana o ne a hloka ho utloa ntho e sieo.
That, of course, is not good news.	Ho hlakile hore tseo hase litaba tse molemo.
But he did not need it.	Empa o ne a sa hloke.
There is nothing to sleep on.	Ha ho letho la ho robala.
None of us know what to do.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea tsebang seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
He decided to walk.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho tsamaea ka maoto.
I was one of those issues.	Ke ne ke le e mong oa litaba tseo.
I don't do it.	Ha ke e etse.
Maybe we should go somewhere.	Mohlomong re lokela ho tsamaea sebakeng se seng.
Sometimes, they paid.	Ka linako tse ling, ba ne ba lefa.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
More than your husband does.	Ho feta kamoo monna oa hao a etsang kateng.
I returned home to hear more.	Ke ile ka khutlela hae ho ea utloa litaba tse ling.
I did not sleep last night.	Ha kea robala bosiung bo fetileng.
I'm talking about it.	Ke bua ka eona.
You wanted to do everything right.	U ne u batla ho etsa lintho tsohle hantle.
I like to think so.	Ke rata ho nahana joalo.
I have to go back to work.	Ke tlameha ho khutlela mosebetsing.
So we started visiting.	Kahoo re ile ra qala ho etela.
No one likes to be injured.	Ha ho motho ea ratang ha motho a tsoa kotsi.
One day he asked her about it.	Ka letsatsi le leng o ile a mo botsa ka eona.
It is very important.	Ho bohlokoa haholo.
Somehow, you are all guilty!	Ka tsela e itseng, kaofela le molato!
They say you have a good chance of traveling again.	Ba re u na le monyetla o motle oa ho tsamaea hape.
My father is such a person.	Ntate oa ka ke motho ea joalo.
I know how painful it is.	Kea tseba hore na ho bohloko hakae.
Of course you have it.	Ehlile u na le eona.
But really no one.	Empa ha e le hantle ha ho motho.
Several days.	Matsatsi a 'maloa.
In the same room.	Ka kamoreng e le 'ngoe.
See it in action.	U e bone e sebetsa.
You are beautiful too.	Le wena o motle.
I live here.	Ke lula mona.
Travel is good.	Ho tsamaea ho molemo.
I am a worker.	Ke ea sebetsa.
One does not think it is possible but he was there.	Motho ha a nahane hore ho ka etsahala empa o ne a le teng.
Now he was there and he had nothing.	Jwale o ne a le teng mme a se a se na letho.
You have friends here.	U na le metsoalle e.
You can't expect to win this way.	U ke ke ua lebella ho hlola ka tsela ena.
It still works on it.	E ntse e sebetsa ho eona.
It was yours.	E ne e le ea hau.
She understood her son well.	O ne a utloisisa mora oa hae hantle.
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
They were already there.	Ba ne ba se ba le teng.
I would have believed more if that was really true.	Ke ne ke tla lumela haholoanyane haeba seo e ne e hlile e le 'nete.
Kick ass.	E monate haholo.
He was really happy.	Ehlile o ne a thabile.
In fact, it is much easier.	Ka 'nete, ho bonolo haholo.
I don’t think you can think of one without the other.	Ha ke nahane hore u ka khona ho nahana ka e 'ngoe ntle le e' ngoe.
A man nearby can do that.	Monna ea haufi a ka etsa joalo.
Now it was individual.	Joale e ne e se e le motho ka mong.
Several books.	Libuka tse 'maloa.
I am well on my feet.	Ke hantle ka maoto.
That is not our job.	Seo ha se mosebetsi oa rona.
No one believed him.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a lumela hore o teng.
Your feedback is important to us.	Maikutlo a hau a bohlokoa ho rona.
But it is useless to talk about that now.	Empa ha ho na thuso ho bua ka seo hona joale.
You just have to try it.	U tlameha feela ho e leka.
Back.	Morao.
If anyone can tell me, that would be nice.	Ha motho a ka mpolella, hoo ho ka ba monate.
They understood only the truth.	Ba ne ba utloisisa bonnete feela.
We can't stay here.	Re ke ke ra lula mona.
I loved her.	Ke ne ke mo rata.
Some thought so.	Ba bang ba ne ba nahana joalo.
We have to talk.	Re tlameha ho bua.
It will not return for some time.	E ke ke ea khutla ka nako e itseng.
He opened the door.	A bula lemati.
New things come at times that are strange.	Lintho tse ncha li tla ka makhetlo a makatsang.
He opened the door and helped her inside.	A bula lemati mme a mo thusa ho kena.
And it will work well.	'Me e tla sebetsa hantle.
I think food is no more important than space.	Ke nahana hore lijo ha li bohlokoa ho feta sebaka.
Each is important in its own way.	E 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e bohlokoa ka tsela ea eona.
He didn't expect that, either.	O ne a sa lebella seo, le hona.
And then you will come.	'Me joale u tla tla.
That's just right sometimes.	Ke 'nete feela ka linako tse ling.
they asked.	ba botsa.
I loved it.	Ke ne ke e rata.
It was time to talk.	E ne e le nako ea ho bua.
I believe this will fix your problem.	Ke lumela hore sena se tla lokisa bothata ba hau.
And money.	Le chelete.
He arrived a day later.	O ile a fihla ka mor'a letsatsi.
We had too many people.	Re ne re e-na le batho ba bangata haholo.
I became stronger.	Ke ile ka ba matla.
Everything they did to him.	Sohle seo ba mo entseng sona.
Of course we can go anywhere for a drink.	Ha e le hantle re ka ea kae kapa kae bakeng sa ho noa.
I'll have to look it up to tell you.	Ke tla tlameha ho e sheba ho le bolella.
A little more.	Ho feta hanyane.
I know you know how to be nice.	Kea tseba hore u tseba ho ba motle.
But it had to start.	Empa e ne e tlameha ho qala.
My father does not want to be alone.	Ntate ha a batle ho ba mong.
I know we can do it.	Kea tseba hore re ka e etsa.
As if no one had ever met him before or would ever meet again.	Joalo ka ha ho ne ho se motho eo a kileng a kopana le eena pele kapa a tla kopana hape.
This will be the last one.	Ena e tla ba ea ho qetela.
I have never seen so many in one place.	Ha ke eso bone tse ngata hakana sebakeng se le seng.
I love you man.	Kea u rata monna.
They often did.	Hangata ba ne ba etsa joalo.
We continued on until we reached his home.	Re ile ra tsoela pele ho fihlela re fihla ha hae.
It took him a while.	Ho ile ha mo nka nako.
There was nothing to that.	Ho ne ho se letho ho seo.
But there is none.	Empa ha ho na.
Mind is important.	Kelello ke ea bohlokoa.
He was wearing his nightgown.	O ne a apere liaparo tsa hae tsa ho robala ka ntle.
Tonight, he thought, tonight would be the last.	Bosiung bona, a nahana, bosiung bona e tla ba ba ho qetela.
That did it.	Seo se e entse.
Now we get it.	Joale rea e fumana.
Thanks for the help in advance.	Ke leboha thuso esale pele.
He was very alone.	O ne a le mong haholo.
You do not have to do anything.	Ha ho hlokahale hore u etse letho.
Make it easy to be a doctor.	Etsa hore ho be bonolo ho ba ngaka.
Here is my point.	Taba ea ka ke ena.
That is very important to me.	Seo se bohlokoa haholo ho nna.
But maybe it's my problem beyond yours.	Empa mohlomong ke bothata ba ka ho feta ba hau.
It can be very useful.	E ka ba molemo haholo.
I can't give it to them right now.	Ha ke khone ho ba fa eona hona joale.
The girl kept crying.	Ngoanana eo a ’na a lla.
All the kids love you.	Bana bohle ba o rata.
They never have been and probably never will be.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba ba teng 'me mohlomong ba ke ke ba ba teng.
That's what he told me.	Ke seo a ileng a mpolella sona.
It was time for me to be alone.	E ne e le nako ea hore ke be mong.
He has been long enough.	O bile le nako e telele ho lekana.
Refusal is no longer a possibility.	Ho hana ha e sa le ntho e ka etsahalang.
And the children were gone.	Mme bana ba ne ba ile.
However, one thing is.	Leha ho le joalo, ntho e le 'ngoe ke.
It does not require both.	Ha e hloke ka bobeli.
You like to dress up.	U rata ho apara.
You can no longer win.	U ke ke ua hlola.
His career began.	Mosebetsi oa hae o ile oa qala.
I love our house.	Ke rata ntlo ya rona.
Matters were not visible.	Litaba li ne li sa bonahale.
I looked closely.	Ka sheba haufi.
I think there is a reason for it.	Ke nahana hore ho na le lebaka la eona.
I can't handle it.	Ha ke khone ho e tšoara.
I was alone.	Ke ne ke le mong.
They do not know how difficult your life is.	Ha ba tsebe hore na bophelo ba hau bo thata hakae.
It should be simple.	E lokela ho ba bonolo.
He was just living his life.	O ne a phela bophelo ba hae feela.
He did not get it.	Ha a ka a e fumana.
And it's really fun.	'Me e hlile e thabela.
He could not speak or hear well.	O ne a sa khone ho bua kapa ho utloa hantle.
We are glad to see you.	Re thabetse ho u bona.
You may be interested in hearing that.	E ka ’na eaba u thabetse ho utloa seo.
I think he lives a long time.	Ke nahana hore o phela nako e telele.
Get ideas and opinions.	Fumana maikutlo le maikutlo.
It seems like a lot, what they have.	E bonahala e le ngata haholo, seo ba nang le sona.
First day of school.	Letsatsi la pele la sekolo.
That's him.	Ke eena.
I said we could start our lives here.	Ke itse re ka qala bophelo ba rona mona.
In fact, it could have been worse.	Ha e le hantle, e ka ’na eaba e ne e le mpe le ho feta.
And all of this will come out.	'Me tsena tsohle li tla tsoa.
However, I do not want him.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke mo batle.
What's his name?	Lebitso la hae ke mang.
Maybe I didn’t want to know.	Mohlomong ke ne ke sa batle ho tseba.
I had a very late night.	Ke bile le bosiu haholo.
That was my first thought.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo oa ka oa pele.
I don't even believe he wanted to do this.	Ha ke lumele le hore o ne a batla ho etsa sena.
I just had to find out who she was.	Ke ne ke tlameha feela ho fumana hore na ke mang.
We do not need them.	Ha re li hloke.
He seized the opportunity.	O ile a sebelisa monyetla ona.
It was more important than that.	E ne e le ntho ea bohlokoa ho feta eo.
I began to sing softly.	Ke ile ka qala ho bina ka bonolo.
But he did not want to stay in the room forever.	Empa o ne a sa batle ho dula ka phaposing ho ya ho ile.
There is no way to predict what is happening in the area.	Ha ho na mokhoa oa ho bolela se etsahalang sebakeng seo.
The issue is there.	Taba e teng moo.
But this is important, too.	Empa sena se bohlokoa, hape.
Talk about incompatibility with the truth.	Bua ka ho se kopane le 'nete.
Money was needed.	Ho ne ho hlokahala chelete.
If it can, it will be better.	Haeba e ka khona, e tla ba molemo.
No, we take their lives.	Che, re nka bophelo ba bona.
If we take a lot, we are fine.	Haeba le ha re nka e ngata, re hantle.
Apparently he had nothing.	Ho bonahala a ne a se na letho.
It’s easier than that, even though the water got in there.	Ho bonolo ho feta, leha metsi a ile a kena moo.
Just let him talk to me.	E re feela a bue le nna.
Of course, there is no way to know for sure.	Ehlile, ha ho mokhoa oa ho tseba hantle.
He did not forget us.	Ha a ka a re lebala.
The room was empty.	Kamore e ne e se na letho.
This is a great place to sleep.	Sena ke sebaka se setle sa ho robala.
It's just a suggestion.	Ke tlhahiso feela.
Mine is even more so.	Ea ka e joalo le ho feta.
It is very clear.	E hlakile haholo.
It is a form of indifference.	Ke mokhoa oa ho se tsotelle.
But you need to learn them well.	Empa u lokela ho ithuta tsona hantle.
Do you know that?	Na seo oa tseba.
I do nothing with my hair.	Ha ho letho leo ke le etsang ka moriri oa ka.
I knew exactly where everyone was.	Ke ne ke tseba hantle moo bohle ba leng teng.
I study hard.	Ke ithuta ka thata.
Something very important is about to happen soon.	Ntho e 'ngoe ea bohlokoa e tlameha ho etsahala haufinyane.
He likes that.	O rata joalo.
Here we suggest an alternative.	Mona re fana ka maikutlo a tsela e 'ngoe.
However, that is not the real question.	Leha ho le joalo, eo hase eona potso ea sebele.
But that is the only way.	Empa ke eona feela tsela.
He lives his life one day at a time.	O phela bophelo ba hae letsatsi le le leng ka nako.
Clearly, there was something wrong with his car.	Ho hlakile hore ho ne ho e-na le phoso ka koloi ea hae.
Then he went back to sleep.	Ka nako eo a khutlela ho robala.
That girl is me.	Ngoanana eo ke 'na.
He is the one who did not understand us.	Ke eena ea sa kang a re utloisisa.
Take that book with you.	Tsamaea le buka eo.
He talked to me all night.	O ile a bua le ’na bosiu bohle.
And certainly a lot of people talk.	'Me ka sebele batho ba bangata ba buang.
It was not her fault.	E ne e se molato wa hae.
Continue overnight.	Tsoela pele bosiu.
It is very difficult that way.	Ho thata haholo ka tsela eo.
I no longer feel that way.	Ha ke sa ikutloa joalo.
But that was not enough for him.	Empa hoo ho ne ho sa lekana bakeng sa hae.
You're very nice.	O hantle haholo.
We both knew where we were going.	Ka bobeli re ne re tseba moo re lokelang ho ea teng.
We must not forget it.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho e lebala.
They did this time.	Ba entse ka nako ena.
It was more than we were at that time.	E ne e le ho feta hore re ne re le nakong eo.
There was nobody there.	Ho ne ho se motho moo.
It could have been anyone.	E ka be e bile mang kapa mang.
He wanted us to know him.	O ne a rata hore ebe rea mo tseba.
There is something wrong with this image.	Ho na le phoso ka setšoantšo sena.
He never learned to read or write well, let alone speak.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ithuta ho bala kapa ho ngola hantle, re se re sa re letho ka ho bua.
So I don't have enough time right now.	Kahoo ha ke na nako e lekaneng hona joale.
We travel well together.	Re tsamaea hammoho hantle.
Make things easier for him to start with.	Etsa hore lintho li be bonolo ho eena ho qala ka tsona.
We all have a past.	Kaofela re na le nako e fetileng.
The children are obviously happy.	Ho hlakile hore bana ba thabile.
Besides, you told us things that we did not know before.	Ntle ho moo, u re boleletse lintho tseo re neng re sa li tsebe pele.
We know who we are talking about.	Rea tseba hore na re bua ka mang.
I look down at my old shoes.	Ke sheba fatše lieta tsa ka tsa khale.
But it was something.	Empa e ne e le ntho e itseng.
Money is nothing.	Chelete ha se letho.
But none of these things are true.	Empa ha ho le e ’ngoe ea lintho tsena eo e leng ’nete.
Yes, it was.	E, ho ne ho le joalo.
I found this.	Ke fumane sena.
It means something better.	Ho bolela ho hong ho molemo.
So none of these are.	Kahoo ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona eo e leng eona.
But we must take advantage.	Empa re tlameha ho nka monyetla.
I thought it would be very difficult, but it was not.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho tla ba thata haholo, empa ho ne ho se joalo.
It is not easy to see it unless you wanted it.	Ha ho bonolo ho e bona ntle le haeba o ne o e batla.
He knows her.	O a mo tseba.
It's not me anymore.	Ha e sa le 'na.
He says it's time.	O re ke nako.
So you have to say.	Kahoo u lokela ho bolela.
It’s not that strong, but it’s very fun.	Ha e matla hakaalo, empa e monate haholo.
He will not come to you.	A ke ke a tla ho wena.
They were all guilty.	Kaofela ba ne ba le molato.
I am here near you.	Ke mona haufi le uena.
It was useless, he thought.	Ho ne ho se na thuso, a nahana joalo.
He always forgets his name.	O dula a lebala lebitso la hae.
This is an area with significant purchasing power.	Sena ke sebaka se nang le matla a bohlokoa a ho reka.
I loved hearing the man speak.	Ke ne ke rata ho utloa monna eo a bua.
I don't care to do that.	Ha ke tsotelle ho etsa joalo.
I have time for dinner and dinner.	Ke na le nako ea ho ja le lijo tsa mantsiboea.
However, there is no such thing.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho letho le le leng.
It is very powerful but it can drive amazingly well.	E matla haholo empa e khona ho khanna ka mokhoa o makatsang.
We go through pain.	Re feta bohloko.
Of course it can be.	Ehlile ho ka ba jwalo.
Their situation was simple.	Boemo ba bona bo ne bo le bonolo.
I don't think we can ask for more.	Ha ke nahane hore re ka kopa ho feta.
We go back a lot, me and him.	Re khutlela morao haholo, 'na le eena.
You know it when you hear it.	U e tseba ha u e utloa.
It is certainly not an easy task.	Ka sebele hase mosebetsi o bonolo.
We have to go there.	Re tlameha ho ea moo.
It has never happened before.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea etsahala pele.
It can be the same with you.	Ho ka ba joalo le ho uena.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
I knew there was something wrong.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ho na le phoso.
It has no position to do so.	Ha e na boemo ba ho etsa joalo.
Well, many more.	Joalo, tse ling tse ngata.
One is that we need to think a lot.	E 'ngoe ke hore re lokela ho nahana haholo.
Obviously he was happy to ride.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a thabetse ho palama.
It will be very close.	E tla ba haufi haholo.
We must do this.	Re tlameha ho etsa sena.
I'm just a kid, after all.	Ke ngoana feela, ka mor'a tsohle.
We traveled together because we did not travel with anyone.	Re ne re tsamaea hammoho hobane re ne re sa tsamaee le mang kapa mang.
I think you will enjoy it.	Ke nahana hore o tla e thabela.
He was present and did that.	O bile teng mme o entse seo.
His mind was empty.	Kelello ea hae e ne e se na letho.
I just did what I had to do.	Ke entse feela seo ke neng ke lokela ho se etsa.
I think a lot of people were like that.	Ke nahana hore batho ba bangata ba ne ba le joalo.
We don't need that.	Ha re hloke seo.
You cannot be everything to everyone.	O ka se be tsohle ho bohle.
And, we can give life.	Mme, re ka fana ka bophelo.
No one else will do it for them.	Ha ho motho e mong ea tla ba etsetsa eona.
Which was not a good thing for me.	E neng e se ntho e ntle ho nna.
He should not have the power to love.	Ha a lokela ho ba le matla a ho rata.
But it may work.	Empa mohlomong e ka sebetsa.
For those who love to read, there is nothing more fun.	Bakeng sa ba ratang ho bala, ha ho letho le monate ho feta.
It really is not my decision.	Ha e le hantle ha se qeto ea ka.
No one told her to do this.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo bolella ho etsa sena.
You found out it was writing.	U fumane hore ke ho ngola.
There was nothing there, of course.	Ho ne ho se letho moo, ehlile.
Maybe that would be best.	Mohlomong hoo ho ka ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
We can no longer live together.	Re ke ke ra tsoela pele ho phela hammoho.
Decide on it.	Etsa qeto ka eona.
You will love this.	O tla rata sena.
Because we know you like this group.	Hobane rea tseba hore u rata sehlopha sena.
We are very happy that we did.	Re thabile haholo hore ebe re entse seo.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
It is not his.	Ha se ea hae.
Please do not comment on this matter.	Ke kopa o seke oa bua letho ka taba ena.
I understand that this is his first book.	Kea utloisisa hore ena ke buka ea hae ea pele.
I just got off the floor.	Ke sa tsoa tsoa fatše.
None of these are real.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsena eo e leng ea sebele.
But this is the last chance.	Empa ona ke monyetla oa ho qetela.
I will not need that.	Ha ke na ho hloka seo.
There was none of them now.	Ho ne ho se le e 'ngoe ea tsona joale.
You will never know why.	U ke ke ua tseba lebaka.
There is nothing more to say.	Ha ho na ho feta ho bua.
But there is.	Empa ho teng.
I have no problem with that.	Ha ke na bothata le seo.
It was just my chance.	E ne e le monyetla oa ka feela.
They are already there waiting for you.	Ba se ba le teng ba o emetse.
I hope you find it.	Ke tšepa hore o tla e fumana.
However, they had a problem.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba e-na le bothata.
In fact, it is his job.	Ha e le hantle, ke mosebetsi oa hae.
I can be there for you.	Nka ba teng bakeng sa hau.
He did better than we expected.	O entse hantle ho feta kamoo re neng re lebeletse kateng.
I am new to this, and I would appreciate any help.	Ke ncha ho sena, 'me ke tla thabela thuso efe kapa efe.
I know you.	Ke a u tseba.
Today seems to be one of those times.	Kajeno ho bonahala e le e 'ngoe ea linako tseo.
He just didn't do it.	Feela o ne a sa etsa joalo.
She knew how to cry.	O ne a tseba hore na a ka lla joang.
Someone did, that's right.	Ho na le motho ea entseng joalo, ke 'nete.
That would be another.	E neng e tla ba e 'ngoe.
But they would not be so hard to work with.	Empa ba ne ba ke ke ba ba thata hakaalo ho sebetsa.
Make sure you hear.	Etsa bonnete ba hore oa utloa.
So far, so good.	Ho fihlela joale, ho joalo.
Then we begin to live it.	Joale re qala ho e phela.
When he arrived, there was something.	Ha a fihla, ho ne ho e-na le ho hong.
I was really good at being second in his career.	Ke ne ke le hantle ka ho ba oa bobeli mosebetsing oa hae.
Yes, we did.	E, re ile ra etsa joalo.
No one should learn about pain.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho ithuta ka bohloko.
However, I could not tell him exactly that.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke sa khone ho mo bolella seo hantle.
You are doing an important job.	U etsa mosebetsi oa bohlokoa.
His legs were even worse.	Maoto a hae a ne a le mpe le ho feta.
I have so many things to learn.	Ke na le lintho tse ngata tseo ke lokelang ho ithuta tsona.
Of work.	Ea mosebetsi.
he thought.	a nahana.
Maybe he did.	Mohlomong o ile a etsa joalo.
Che, Che, Che, Che.	Che, Che, Che, Che.
He will be home tomorrow night.	O tla be a le hae hosane bosiu.
You are arrested.	U tšoeroe.
It was not necessary.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale.
They leave home in the morning to have breakfast.	Ba tloha hae hoseng ho ea ja lijo tsa hoseng.
Eaba.	Eaba.
He told me all about it.	O ile a mpolella tsohle ka eona.
But he knows what happened.	Empa o tseba se ileng sa etsahala.
Are you done?	Na u qetile?
He had a past.	O ne a e-na le nako e fetileng.
But then we wanted to learn it by doing so.	Empa joale re ne re batla ho ithuta eona ka ho etsa joalo.
You will have to stop and see.	U tla tlameha ho ema 'me u bone.
He studied hard for three years.	O ile a ithuta ka thata ka lilemo tse tharo.
They could not.	Ba ne ba sa khone.
This he knew.	Sena o ne a se tseba.
So thank you both for being here.	Kahoo kea le leboha ka bobeli ka ho ba teng mona.
She is beautiful.	O motle.
Just like what we did this morning.	Jwalo feela ka seo re se entseng hoseng hona.
Not a problem.	Ha se bothata.
It's wet.	E metsi.
There is something wrong, though.	Ho na le ntho e mpe, leha ho le joalo.
And then you meet the rest of the team.	'Me joale u kopana le ba bang kaofela ba sehlopha.
Play with children.	Bapala le bana.
This group was easy to handle.	Sehlopha sena se ne se le bonolo ho se tšoara.
It was the first time here.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele mona.
Use your head.	Sebelisa hlooho ea hau.
His wife acknowledges his innocence.	Mosali oa hae o lumela hore ha a na molato.
I could have told you sooner.	Nka be ke o boleletse kapele.
It was not fun.	Ho ne ho se monate.
But we cannot understand this mentally.	Empa re ke ke ra utloisisa sena ka kelello.
There is a chance to fix it with someone.	Ho na le monyetla oa ho e lokisa le motho.
Obviously, this would not be easy.	Ho hlakile hore sena se ne se ke ke sa ba bonolo.
They did not want to think about that.	Ba ne ba sa batle ho nahana ka seo.
He must do it whether he likes it or not.	O tlameha ho e etsa a rata kapa a sa rate.
There was nothing he could love more than that.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le ratang ho feta.
His help was invaluable.	Thuso ea hae e ne e le ea bohlokoa haholo.
But that is certainly not the case here.	Empa ha e le hantle ha se eona taba mona.
It turns out that today is such a day.	Hoa etsahala hore kajeno ke letsatsi le joalo.
We are fine together.	Re hantle hammoho.
And you saw my doctor.	'Me u bone ngaka ea ka.
However, he did not think much of it.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa nahana hakaalo ka sena.
I see that happening.	Ke bona seo se etsahala.
These things happen sometimes.	Lintho tsena li etsahala ka linako tse ling.
He said they are both.	O itse ke bobeli.
That is the last of them.	Eo ke oa ho qetela oa bona.
And this is not dangerous.	'Me sena ha se kotsi.
Crying, you know, crying.	Ho lla, ua tseba, ho lla.
Do you .	Na u .
I wish they wouldn't have done that.	Ke lakatsa eka ba ka be ba sa ka ba etsa joalo.
It's a good job.	Ke mosebetsi o motle.
If you have time, please keep reading.	Haeba u na le nako, ka kopo tsoela pele ho bala.
I do not understand them.	Ha ke li utloisise.
The same is true of humans.	Ho joalo le ka batho.
I did not.	Ha kea etsa joalo.
This is really bad.	Sena se hlile se mpe haholo.
He stood up.	A ema ka maoto.
He was neither male nor female.	E ne e se monna kapa mosali.
And, well, he should not.	Mme, hantle, ha a lokela.
There would be no return.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba le ho khutla.
He refused to admit any wrongdoing.	O ile a hana ho lumela phoso leha e le efe.
I hope you enjoyed reading it.	Ke tšepa hore u thabetse ho e bala.
By the man she loved.	Ka monna eo a neng a mo rata.
He believed that the picture was his.	O ne a lumela hore setšoantšo seo ke sa hae.
All they have is money.	Seo ba nang le sona feela ke chelete.
Obviously he was not in it for the money.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a se ho eona bakeng sa chelete.
I can help you if you need it.	Nka u thusa haeba u hloka.
More children than ever before.	Bana ba bangata ho feta pele.
The problem remains.	Bothata bo ntse bo le teng.
Therefore, you need to resolve the matter carefully.	Ka hona, o lokela ho lokisa taba ena ka hloko.
Some will do the same.	Ba bang ba tla etsa joalo.
Tomorrow may happen, but it probably does not.	Hosane ho ka etsahala, empa hape mohlomong ha ho joalo.
Before they arrived, they did not know the problem.	Pele ba fihla, ba ne ba sa tsebe bothata.
These are powerful things.	Tsena ke lintho tse matla.
You must help us to help you.	U tlameha ho re thusa ho u thusa.
It is his celebration.	Ke mokete oa hae.
You can make a lot of money.	U ka etsa chelete e ngata.
Doing this several times will be easier.	Ho etsa sena ka makhetlo a 'maloa ho tla ba bonolo.
The reason they did it.	Lebaka leo ba e entseng.
That's one of those things.	Ke e 'ngoe ea lintho tseo.
I was in another one recently.	Ke ne ke le ho e 'ngoe haufinyane.
Do they all arrive by car?	Na bohle ba fihla ka koloi?
He has always been good to you.	Haesale a le molemo ho wena.
We kept the line running at all times.	Re ne re boloka mohala o sebetsa ka linako tsohle.
This is not a mental question.	Sena ha se potso ea kelello.
But that, too, was good.	Empa seo, le sona se ne se le setle.
But by then, it was too late.	Empa ka nako eo, e ne e se e le morao haholo.
So, that's what he wanted to do.	Kahoo, ke seo a neng a batla ho se etsa.
Anyway, sorry about the problem, everyone.	Leha ho le joalo, masoabi ka bothata, bohle.
You got it.	U e fumane.
Things were going very fast now.	Lintho li ne li tsamaea kapele haholo joale.
Because I see the whole problem here.	Hobane ke bona bothata bohle mona.
But this is not the time for it.	Empa ena ha se nako ea eona.
But it was clear enough.	Empa ho ne ho hlakile ho lekana.
So you wear them all the time.	Kahoo u li apara ka linako tsohle .
It demands from you what you want for yourself.	E batla ho uena seo u se batlang bakeng sa hau.
He loved her.	O ile a mo rata.
Nobody knew where he went and why.	Ho ne ho se motho ea tsebang hore na o ile hokae le hore na ke hobane'ng.
I see it !.	Kea le bona!.
I will make him find you.	Ke tla etsa hore a u fumane.
However, he realized that he had found water.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a hlokomela hore o fumane metsi.
I think this is what you want.	Ke nahana hore sena ke seo u se batlang.
But there are problems.	Empa ho na le mathata.
It works well.	E sebetsa hantle.
Maybe now it was time.	Mohlomong joale e ne e le nako.
He said why not.	O itse hobaneng ho se joalo.
I need to sleep with her again.	Ke hloka ho robala le eena hape.
I like to win.	Ke rata ho hlola.
He could have stayed with us.	A ka be a ile a lula le rona.
You have to do it.	U lokela ho e etsa.
This is a great opportunity.	Ena ke monyetla o motle haholo.
To me they are books.	Ho 'na ke libuka.
And that's when you open the door.	Mme ke ha o bula lemati.
He decided not to talk about it.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho se bue ka eona.
This too is coming.	Sena le sona se tla.
But they are the most numerous.	Empa ke tse ngata ka ho fetisisa.
He couldn't decide what he liked more than that.	O ne a sitoa ho etsa qeto ea hore na o rata eng ho feta moo.
Yes, look at me.	E, sheba 'na.
He is not alone.	Ha se eena feela.
I've been thinking about you.	esale ke nahana ka wena.
Now to another.	Hona joale ho ea ho e 'ngoe.
I felt a sharp pain in the back of my head.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko bo bohloko ka morao ho hlooho ea ka.
So this seems to be a problem.	Kahoo sena se bonahala e le bothata.
The team has to work harder.	Sehlopha se tlameha ho sebetsa ka thata ho feta.
It was here, very close.	E ne e le mona, e haufi haholo.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
They do not know what it means to be human.	Ha ba tsebe hore na ho bolela eng ho ba motho.
It is not my place to tell him.	Ha se sebaka sa ka ho mo bolella.
I have many.	Ke na le tse ngata.
There was nothing else we could do.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng leo re ka le etsang.
Maybe you know why.	Mohlomong u tseba lebaka.
Good or bad.	E ntle kapa e mpe.
I just think you should know.	Ke nahana feela hore o lokela ho tseba.
I don’t think why he would want this.	Ha ke nahane hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ka batla sena.
There is no place to go, there is nothing you can do.	Ha ho sebaka sa ho tsamaea, ha ho letho leo u ka le etsang.
I don't know what's going on.	Ha ke tsebe se etsahalang.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
Legs for several years.	Maoto ka lilemo tse 'maloa.
Use what you like.	Sebelisa seo u se ratang.
Something like this should work.	Ntho e kang ena e lokela ho sebetsa.
It doesn't matter to me.	Ha ho na taba le nna.
Most certainly.	Ka ho fetisisa ruri.
But he did not leave it at that.	Empa ha aa ka a e tlohela joalo.
I wanted to see where you would end up.	Ke ne ke batla ho bona hore na u tla fihla hokae.
So it all goes.	Kahoo tsohle li tsamaea.
He spoke a little to me.	A bua hanyane ho nna.
But here is my suggestion.	Empa tlhahiso ea ka ke ena.
He says that's why.	O re seo ke lebaka la bona.
I'm going out now.	Ke ea tsoa hona joale.
He never talked about them.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka tsona.
He knew he would have to see her soon.	O ne a tseba hore o tla tlameha ho mo bona haufinyane.
I just knew.	Ke ne ke tseba feela.
He can't do that.	A ke ke a etsa hoo.
Is it tasty.	E monate.
I wanted to get in without any problems.	Ke ne ke batla ho kena ntle le mathata a mang.
Tomorrow, we will meet him !.	Hosane, re tla kopana le eena!.
The first thing we did was very simple.	Ntho ea pele eo re e entseng e ne e le bonolo haholo.
We are both very happy with it.	Ka bobeli re thabile haholo ka eona.
They seemed to belong somewhere, someone else.	Ba ne ba bonahala eka ke ba sebakeng se seng, ba motho e mong.
His mind was somewhere else.	Kelello ea hae e ne e le sebakeng se seng.
Very good.	Ho molemo haholo.
Everyone seemed to think this was a good idea.	E mong le e mong o ne a bonahala a nahana hore ona ke mohopolo o motle.
So, yes, please questions.	Kahoo, e, ka kopo lipotso.
There were many more.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse ling tse ngata.
The less you do it, the faster they will come.	Ha u e etsa hanyane, ba tla kapele.
I do not know when I will get the new one.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke tla fumana e ncha neng.
Today this means starting to write here again.	Kajeno sena se bolela ho qala ho ngola mona hape.
But she was beautiful in any way.	Empa o ne a le motle ka tsela efe kapa efe.
The children were happy.	Bana ba ne ba thabile.
And that's a good thing.	Mme ke ntho e ntle.
He stopped when several others did the same.	O ile a ema ha ba bang ba ’maloa ba etsa joalo.
He enters.	O kena.
We went through it because we had one.	Re ile ra feta ho eona hobane re ne re e-na le e mong.
I don't know if it's such a good idea.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke mohopolo o motle hakana na.
It just starts.	E qala feela.
True, we are in danger.	Ke 'nete hore re kotsing.
My parents live there.	Batsoali ba ka ba lula moo.
I don't want to be you either.	Le 'na ha ke batle ho ba uena.
Finally, he found what he was looking for.	Qetellong, o ile a fumana seo a neng a se batla.
Then to me.	Ebe ho nna.
I want to know how it works.	Ke batla ho tseba hore na o sebetsa joang.
Maybe more than that.	Mohlomong ho feta moo.
It was clear he did not know what to do.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore o ne a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng.
But he would think of something else.	Empa o ne a tla nahana ka se seng.
As he walks.	Ha a ntse a tsamaea.
He doesn't know what he's doing.	Ha a tsebe seo a se etsang.
It has it.	E ba le eona.
I could go to him.	Ke ne ke khona ho ea ho eena.
He told everyone what had happened.	O ile a bolella bohle se etsahetseng.
We will pass.	Re tla feta.
It's better.	E betere.
Be with me right now.	Eba le 'na 'nete hona joale.
It was fun to be able to do that.	Ho ne ho le monate ho khona ho etsa joalo.
And I'm very happy about that.	Mme ke thabile haholo ka hona.
Then we need more playing time.	Ebe re hloka linako tse ling tsa ho bapala.
She was beginning to wonder.	O ne a se a qala ho ipotsa.
All we have is questions.	Seo re nang le sona feela ke lipotso.
I have a job to do.	Ke na le mosebetsi oo ke lokelang ho o etsa.
Instead, he takes a picture to save.	Ho e-na le hoo, o nka setšoantšo ho boloka.
We treat you like a family.	Re le tšoara joalo ka lelapa.
I love helping people.	Ke rata ho thusa batho.
He had no head or legs.	O ne a sena hlooho kapa maoto.
I would love to hear more about that.	Nka thabela ho utloa haholoanyane ka seo.
What do you like to eat?	O rata ho ja eng?
But he knows it is morning.	Empa o a tseba hore ho sa le hoseng.
In it there were not many new ones.	Ho eona ho ne ho se na tse ngata tse ncha.
He had something he wanted to tell me.	O ne a na le seo a batlang ho mpolella sona.
But there was no room.	Empa ho ne ho se sebaka.
That's right.	Ke 'nete eo.
However, he knew nothing.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa tsebe letho.
I'm getting it.	Ke ntse ke fumana.
But is he really innocent?	Empa na ehlile ha a na molato?
That will come next week.	Seo se tla tla bekeng e tlang.
We will not be able to hold them for long.	Re ke ke ra khona ho li tšoara nako e telele.
Like everything it was good.	Joalo ka ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e ne e le ntle.
When it was us.	Ha e ne e le rona.
It will all be.	E tla ba kaofela.
I was expecting it, for sure.	Ke ne ke e lebeletse, ka 'nete.
There is a very simple way to do it.	Ho na le mokhoa o bonolo haholo oa ho o etsa.
So I am the only one.	Kahoo ke 'na feela.
I have to see it.	Ke lokela ho e bona.
The most important thing is learning.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa ke ho ithuta.
Nobody is going to do that for you.	Ha ho motho ea tla u etsetsa joalo.
He looks at us intently.	O re sheba ka matla.
He is a good dog.	Ke ntja e ntle.
Now we have some problems.	Hona joale re na le mathata a mang.
It's a problem, a real problem.	Ke bothata, bothata ruri.
I said I was mine.	Ke itse ke ea ka.
I don’t know what the kids got.	Ha ke tsebe hore na bana ba fumane eng.
You look beautiful.	O shebahala o le motle.
One can look for it again at night.	Motho a ka e batla hape bosiu.
Maybe say something.	Mohlomong bua ho hong.
I loved it, too.	Ke ne ke e rata, le eena.
I can't sleep.	Ha ke khone ho robala.
However you have to go through this process.	Leha ho le joalo u tlameha ho feta ka mokhoa ona.
He did not plan today.	O ne a sa rera kajeno.
It did not last long.	Ha ea ka ea ema nako e telele.
You have been so good.	U bile molemo haholo.
You will get more than you want.	U tla fumana ho feta seo u se batlang.
You have to wait until the end.	U lokela ho ema ho fihlela qetellong.
He slept well that night.	O ile a robala hantle bosiung boo.
It's hard, to be honest.	Ho thata, ho bua 'nete.
He spent a lot of time with us and was very helpful.	O ne a qeta nako e ngata a e-na le rona mme a re thusa haholo.
School of.	Sekolo sa.
It is coming.	E ea tla.
It looks like some people want it.	E shebahala kamoo batho ba bang ba e batlang kateng.
And it was easy to do that right.	Mme ho ne ho le bonolo ho etsa ntho eo hantle.
Maybe that was their problem.	Mohlomong boo e ne e le bothata ba bona.
But, we'll see.	Empa, re tla bona.
That is just the truth of the matter.	Seo ke 'nete feela ea boemo.
For good, of course.	Bakeng sa molemo, ho hlakile.
There was no request that was difficult for him.	Ho ne ho se kopo e neng e le boima ho eena.
His second wife.	Mosali oa hae oa bobeli.
He could have realized he had them.	A ka be a ile a hlokomela hore o na le tsona.
What with a person?	Ke eng le motho?
He learns from her.	O ithuta ho eena.
Clearly, they were thinking hard.	Ho hlakile hore ba ne ba nahana ka thata.
And yes, she looked at him.	Mme e, ya mo sheba.
Things are simple.	Lintho li bonolo.
Why didn't you come yesterday?	Hobaneng o sa tla maobane?
Do not write anything down.	U se ke ua ngola letho fatše.
There is not much more we can say about it.	Ha ho tse ling tse ngata tseo re ka li buang ka eona.
It would work.	E ne e tla sebetsa.
She's a girl, that way.	Ke ngoanana, ka tsela eo.
He needed something else to think about.	O ne a hloka ntho e 'ngoe eo a ka nahanang ka eona.
I did not want to ask first.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho botsa pele.
It is time to move on.	Ke nako ea ho ea pele.
Well, it did.	Be, e entse joalo.
I had to find new school uniforms.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho fumana liaparo tse ncha tsa sekolo.
Probably because he enjoyed it.	Mohlomong hobane o ne a e thabela.
Then one can go anywhere and take any kind.	Joale motho a ka ea kae kapa kae 'me a nka mofuta ofe kapa ofe.
So he fixes it.	Kahoo oa e lokisa.
We really enjoyed it.	Re ile ra e thabela haholo.
And you know nothing.	'Me ha u tsebe letho.
It was a long time.	E ne e le nako e telele.
He was just beginning to see them.	O ne a qala ho ba bona.
Then it can be very good.	Joale e ka ba hantle haholo.
Nothing here for me right now.	Ha ho letho mona bakeng sa ka hona joale.
Still, people seem to like it.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bonahala batho ba e rata.
It's too old.	Ke khale haholo .
That's the mother.	Ke mme eo.
What he knew.	Seo a neng a se tseba.
It's my family.	Ke lelapa la ka.
There is plenty of help for everyone.	Ho na le thuso e ngata bakeng sa bohle.
But that was not the only time.	Empa eo e ne e se eona feela nako e etsahetseng.
Maybe you should keep getting it.	Mohlomong o tlameha ho tsoela pele ho e fumana.
I have to come home soon.	Ke tlameha ho tla hae kapele.
I was good to you.	Ke ne ke le molemo ho uena.
I cry about my wife's condition.	Ke lla ka boemo ba mosali oa ka.
But we have never seen this.	Empa ha re eso bone sena.
Stay there.	Dula moo.
There are many now.	Ho na le tse ngata hona joale.
This was very simple.	Sena se ne se le bonolo haholo.
I understood very well.	Ke ne ke utloisisa hantle haholo.
The police never arrested anyone.	Ha ho mohla mapolesa a kileng a tšoara motho.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore ho ne ho sa lokela ho ba joalo.
Trust this method.	Tšepa mokhoa ona.
There is nothing wrong with wanting to stay active.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka ho batla ho lula u sebetsa.
He was a family man.	E ne e le motho oa lelapa.
Now it's yours.	Hona joale ke ea hau.
He did not like the idea.	O ne a sa rate mohopolo oo.
I have a job to do.	Ke na le mosebetsi oo ke lokelang ho o etsa.
I can call.	Nka mohala.
Save the image.	Boloka setšoantšo.
This is just a fun accident.	Ena ke kotsi e monate feela.
I think it's fun.	Ke nahana hore ho monate.
And we do not want it.	'Me ha re e batle.
Yes, no questions.	E, ha ho lipotso.
I did that.	Ke entse joalo.
No one will stay here.	Ha ho motho ea tla lula mona.
I have never had a final problem.	Ha ke so ka ka ba le bothata ba ho qetela.
The young man drank water.	Mohlankana a noa metsi.
I would definitely get that.	Ruri ke ne ke tla fumana seo.
We got to know the people.	Re ile ra tseba batho.
Your time to play.	Nako ea hau ea ho bapala.
I will make sure of it.	Ke tla etsa bonnete ba eona.
It happens every day.	Ho etsahala letsatsi le letsatsi.
He did not give up his name.	Ha a ka a tlohela lebitso la hae.
After years of trying, we finally became a family.	Ka mor’a lilemo tsa ho leka, qetellong re ile ra ba lelapa.
I need to drink my coffee every day.	Ke hloka ho noa kofi ea ka ea letsatsi le letsatsi.
However this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho joalo.
Yet you can never say no.	Leha ho le joalo u ke ke ua re ha ho mohla.
They have never met.	Ha ba eso kopane.
My decision is to come out right.	Qeto ea ka ke ho tsoa hantle.
Just a little bit.	Hanyane feela.
He would be there.	O ne a tla be a le teng.
I have no money to buy anything.	Ha ke na chelete ea ho reka letho.
Do not do it.	U se ke ua e etsa.
In the end, they were alone.	Qetellong, ba ne ba le bang.
I ask a lot of questions.	Ke botsa lipotso tse ngata.
Her mother was gone.	Mme wa hae o ne a ile.
The man seems to know her.	Motho eo o bonahala a mo tseba.
Sometimes, somewhere he thinks.	Ka nako e 'ngoe, sebaka se seng a nahana.
She continues to live alone, with her son.	O ntse a tsoela pele ho lula a le mong, le mora oa hae.
I'm happy for you.	Ke thabela wena.
No one could enter the backyard.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a ka kena ka mor'a ntlo.
I do, but that doesn't matter right now.	Ke etsa joalo, empa seo ha se bohlokoa hona joale.
He did not want to give up his feelings.	O ne a sa batle ho tlohela maikutlo a hae.
And no one said anything.	Mme ha ho le ya mong ya kileng a bua letho.
I've seen that kind before.	Ke bone mofuta oo pele.
I'll tell you what happens.	Ke tla o bolella se etsahalang.
It was the best way.	E ne e le tsela e molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He says he is looking for a job.	O re o batla mosebetsi.
They are all wearing strange clothes.	Bohle ba apere liaparo tse makatsang.
This is not the time.	Ha se nako eo.
We can no longer do anything.	Re ke ke ra hlola re etsa letho.
I'd like to see that.	Ke kopa ho bona seo.
Good for memory.	E ntle ka mohopolo.
He was just here.	O ne a le mona feela.
We did not know what was coming.	Re ne re sa tsebe se tlang.
We talk about how important a team is.	Re bua ka hore na sehlopha se bohlokoa hakae.
I lived with my father.	Ke ne ke lula le Ntate.
Getting into it is already working well.	Ho kena ka eona ho se ho ntse ho sebetsa hantle.
I like that style too, you know.	Le 'na ke rata mokhoa oo, ua tseba.
Otherwise it is useless.	Ho seng joalo ha ho na thuso.
However, she felt better.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a ikutloa a le betere.
But it is very important.	Empa e bohlokoa haholo.
Then it happened.	Joale ho bile joalo.
My son says nothing.	Mora oa ka ha a bue letho.
Just look at the picture here and you will understand.	Sheba feela setšoantšo se mona 'me u tla utloisisa.
I don't know about this.	Ha ke tsebe ka sena.
We have not been able to do that.	Ha re so khone ho etsa joalo.
It's so much fun for you.	Ho monate haholo ho wena.
Certainly not you to tell a woman.	Ka sebele ha se uena ea lokelang ho bolella mosali.
If you see it as a possibility, it is.	Haeba u bona e le ntho e ka etsahalang, ho joalo.
It was very early in the morning.	E ne e le hoseng haholo.
And you can have them.	'Me u ka ba le tsona.
This can be fun.	Sena se ka ba monate.
For anyone here.	Bakeng sa mang kapa mang mona.
There is something you probably need to know.	Ho na le ntho eo mohlomong u lokelang ho e tseba.
They are not sure what to believe.	Ha ba na bonnete ba hore na ba lumele eng.
But it still will not work.	Empa e ntse e ke ke ea sebetsa.
It was a difficult year.	E ne e le lilemo tse thata.
Feeling very good.	Ho ikutloa hantle haholo.
So that's what he does.	Kahoo ke seo a se etsang.
We knew that.	Re ne re tseba seo.
It is an easy task.	Ke mosebetsi o bonolo.
Boy did we have our job.	Moshanyana re ne re e-na le mosebetsi oa rona.
How could they not know.	Ba ne ba ka se tsebe joang.
Every one of them did.	E mong le e mong wa bona o ile a etsa jwalo.
Things are not what they used to be.	Lintho ha li sa le joalo ka pele.
Moreover, it seems.	Ho feta moo, ho bonahala eka.
So it is a very difficult decision.	Kahoo ke qeto e boima haholo.
This was true but not a matter.	Sena e ne e le 'nete empa e se taba.
No more talking.	Ha ho sa bua.
He did not know how long he had been here.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na o bile mona nako e kae.
I heard.	Ke ile ka utloa.
I can't thank you enough for this.	Ha ke khone ho u leboha ka ho lekaneng bakeng sa sena.
They are with me.	Ba na le nna.
A little too soon.	Haufinyane hanyane.
He knew he was in danger.	O ne a tseba hore o kotsing.
But if so, we are the first to know about it.	Empa haeba ho joalo, ke rona ba pele ba ho tseba ka eona.
I had not thought about that for years.	Ke ne ke sa nahane letho ka seo ka lilemo tse ngata.
However, he had a job to do, and he did it.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a e-na le mosebetsi oo a lokelang ho o etsa, ’me o ile a o etsa.
You must stay with me.	O tlameha ho dula le nna.
His mother probably loved him.	Mohlomong 'mè oa hae o ne a mo rata.
I can see why people take it so seriously.	Kea bona hore na ke hobane’ng ha batho ba e nka e le ea bohlokoa hakana.
He wants to stay there.	O batla ho dula moo.
Or think about it.	Kapa nahana ka ho nahana.
I'm done.	Ke qetile.
He felt something was wrong.	O ile a utloa hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
I'm just not sure.	Feela ha ke na bonnete.
When do you think you will retire?	U nahana hore u tla tlohela mosebetsi neng?
You go for the good but they are.	U ea bakeng sa ba molemo empa ba.
I'll see if you can do that.	Ke tla bona hore na u ka etsa joalo.
But then at last we are in a good place.	Empa joale qetellong re sebakeng se setle.
But perhaps most are not sure.	Empa mohlomong ba bangata ha ba na bonnete.
Each other.	E mong le e mong.
So much for this.	Haholo sena.
I need to plan.	Ke hloka ho rera.
I never thought of that before.	Ke ne ke eso nahane seo pele.
Come back to me after a look.	Khutlela ho 'na ka mor'a ho sheba.
Her father was immediately arrested.	Ntate oa hae o ile a tšoaroa kapele.
Something happened to her hair.	Ho na le ntho e etsahetseng ka moriri oa hae.
I used it a lot.	Ke ne ke e sebelisa haholo.
It is a dangerous situation for them.	Ke boemo bo kotsi ho bona.
He finished his breakfast, then went to work.	O ile a qeta lijo tsa hae tsa hoseng, eaba o ea mosebetsing.
You need to save it.	U hloka ho e boloka.
And he saw something else.	Mme a bona se seng hape.
Does that mean.	Na seo se bolela.
Doing so will take the whole book.	Ho etsa joalo ho tla nka buka eohle.
And so it was.	Mme ho bile jwalo.
No thanks.	Che kea leboha.
But we know we will.	Empa rea ​​tseba hore re tla etsa joalo.
But she was happy.	Empa o ne a thabile.
It was not the sun.	E ne e se letsatsi.
Are we eating?	A re je?
The advantage is obvious.	Molemo o hlakile.
I saw it every day.	Ke ne ke e bona letsatsi le letsatsi.
He thought hard.	O ne a nahana ka thata.
I can do anything.	Nka etsa eng kapa eng.
It was hard, it was not a fun time.	Ho ne ho le thata, e ne e se nako e monate.
Because he knew.	Hobane o ne a tseba.
It eats people.	E ja batho.
That is why he was there.	Ke ka lebaka leo a neng a le teng.
He's just not in the room, then he's there.	O mpa a le sieo ka phaposing, ebe o ba teng.
That means something.	Hoo ho bolela ho hong.
You can trust him.	U ka mo tšepa.
We would love to hear from you !.	Re ka thabela ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena!.
I want something.	Ke batla se seng.
That's very nice.	Seo se setle haholo.
Now is the time to get dressed and have breakfast.	Hona joale ke nako ea ho apara le ho ja lijo tsa hoseng.
This is beyond human ability.	Sena se feta seo motho a ka se khonang.
It is not enough.	Ha hoa lekana.
But well, maybe this is not a problem.	Empa hantle, mohlomong sena ha se bothata.
He had a feeling that he was doing something.	O ne a e-na le maikutlo a hore ho na le ntho eo a neng a e etsa.
They need new shoes.	Ba hloka lieta tse ncha.
It's just a matter of time.	Ke taba feela ea nako.
They are still there.	Ba ntse ba le teng.
He was close to me though.	O ne a le haufi le nna leha ho le jwalo.
Otherwise, it was very difficult.	Ho seng joalo, ho ne ho le thata haholo.
I have no idea.	Ha ke na maikutlo.
Of course, he never paid for it.	Ke ’nete hore ha ho mohla a kileng a mo lefa.
We are together.	Re ba hammoho.
But it was only a short time.	Empa e ne e le nako e seng kae.
But that is not true.	Empa hase ’nete.
And, it really is.	Mme, ruri ho jwalo.
There is no breakfast for you. 	Ha ho lijo tsa hoseng bakeng sa hau. 
I have to stay here.	Ke tlameha ho lula mona.
Will do.	Ke tla etsa joalo.
But this is not what this is.	Empa sena ha se seo sena se leng sona.
That has happened before.	Seo se kile sa etsahala pele.
Their parents are gone.	Batsoali ba bona ha ba eo.
And it is obviously harder than this.	'Me ho hlakile hore e ba thata ho feta ena.
To us.	Ho rona.
I hope you like it.	Ke tšepa hore u tla e rata.
I don't think so.	Ha ke nahane hore ho joalo.
We thought that was the only way.	Re ne re nahana hore ke eona feela tsela.
For others, it just happens.	Ho ba bang, ho etsahala feela.
The police did not tell us.	Mapolesa ha aa ka a re bolella.
That's the way it is.	Ke kamoo ho leng kateng.
I just need to see him.	Ke hloka feela ho mo bona.
It took hours for him to walk properly.	Ho ile ha nka lihora hore a tsamaee hantle.
He wrote again.	O ile a ngola hape.
He wanted so many, so many.	O ne a batla tse ngata, tse ngata haholo.
Then he did something he had never done before.	Eaba o etsa ntho eo ho seng mohla a kileng a e etsa.
I have only the first thing.	Ke na le ntho ea pele feela.
Often, though, you never see it again.	Leha ho le joalo, hangata, ha u sa e bona hape.
He told the team that it would win.	O ile a bolella sehlopha hore se tlo hlola.
It was hard.	Ho ne ho le thata.
No shoes, either.	Ha ho lieta, le hape.
And he tells you.	Mme o a o bolella.
I would love to see you there.	Nka thabela ho u bona moo.
Maybe a little more.	Mohlomong ho feta hanyane.
Or something like that.	Kapa tse ling tse joalo.
Obviously, we both enjoy water.	Ho hlakile hore ka bobeli re thabela metsi.
This is as simple as it gets.	Sena se bonolo joalo ka ha se fumana.
People talk about it.	Batho ba bua ka eona.
Either way he will not win.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe a ke ke a hlola.
This takes too long.	Sena se nka nako e telele haholo.
One cannot say more than that.	Motho a ke ke a bua ho feta moo.
Then go to the back of the group.	Ebe u ea ka morao ho sehlopha.
He saw the people.	A bona batho.
She loves to read.	O rata ho bala.
He thought for a moment about what he should do.	A nahana ho se hokae ka seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
That's what it is, nothing more.	Ke seo e leng sona, ha ho letho le leng hape.
I would say this happens every day.	Nka re sena se etsahala ka letsatsi le leng le le leng.
Of course, there are many of them.	Ha e le hantle, ho na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
He left without saying goodbye.	O ile a tsamaea a sa re hantle.
He can do nothing for us.	A ke ke a re etsa letho.
You get a weird kind sometimes.	O fumana mofuta o makatsang ka linako tse ling.
Thank you so much for your help.	Ke leboha thuso ea hau haholo.
He knew his name.	O ne a tseba lebitso la hae.
I doubt they will come back again.	Ke belaela hore na ba tla khutla hape.
We thank him for that.	Re mo leboha ka seo.
It was very important to me.	E ne e le ea bohlokoa haholo ho 'na.
It's fun to read.	Ho monate ho bala.
The same has been true of many others.	Ho bile joalo le ka ba bang ba bangata.
Also use some.	Hape sebelisa tse ling.
I love family very much.	Ke rata lelapa haholo.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
This is another way to do it.	Ena ke mokhoa o mong oa ho e etsa.
They have money now.	Ba na le chelete joale.
But everyone has something to say about him.	Empa e mong le e mong o na le seo a se buang ka eena.
It is nothing new to me.	Ha se ntho e ncha ho 'na.
I have a new one.	Ke na le e ncha.
It was just my reality.	E ne e le 'nete ea ka feela.
Please sit down.	Ke kopa o lule fatše.
It still is.	Ho ntse ho le joalo.
Must read.	E tlameha ho bala.
If he could go back to.	Haeba a ne a ka khutlela ho.
Do you agree or disagree?	Na ua lumela kapa ua hana?
If we do well, they will not do so.	Haeba re etsa hantle, ba ke ke ba etsa joalo.
We did it well.	Re ne re e etsa hantle.
I was happy.	Ke ne ke thabile.
But now, you already know that.	Empa joale, u se u ntse u tseba seo.
I can hear things.	Ke khona ho utloa lintho.
I needed time to work.	Ke ne ke hloka nako ea ho sebetsa.
Think about that for a moment.	Nahana ka seo ho se hokae.
I really did not know that there is a name for it.	Ka sebele ke ne ke sa tsebe hore ho na le lebitso la eona.
Yes, a good man.	E, motho ea molemo.
He knew he was there.	O ne a tseba hore o teng moo.
It's me again.	Ke 'na hape.
He would not have been there if that had been possible.	A ka be a sa ka a ba teng haeba hoo e ne e le ntho e ka etsahalang.
Despite her best efforts, she began to cry.	Le hoja a ile a leka ka matla, o ile a qala ho lla.
Thank you so much !.	Ke leboha haholo!.
Before we leave.	Pele re tsamaea.
They have more than enough food.	Ba na le lijo tse ngata ho feta tse lekaneng.
I can hear him.	Ke khona ho mo utloa.
But now he knew that was not true.	Empa joale o ne a tseba hore seo hase ’nete.
I doubt we will get more tonight.	Ke belaela re tla fumana tse ngata bosiung bona.
But now everyone seems to know it.	Empa joale bohle ba bonahala ba e tseba.
It was very nice, he said.	E ne e le ntle haholo, a re.
It was not a good thing.	E ne e se lintho tse ntle.
If he has.	Haeba a na le.
Most people should know that.	Batho ba bangata ba tlameha ho tseba seo.
We do not know where he went.	Ha re tsebe letho ka moo a ileng a ea teng.
Then you will not see the error.	Joale u ke ke ua bona phoso eo.
It will be up to us.	Ho tla ba ho rona.
He can't get to you.	A ke ke a fihla ho wena.
Still, it can be beneficial.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ka u tsoela molemo.
This type is endangered.	Mofuta ona o kotsing.
We never talk about anything other than our books.	Ha ho mohla re buang ka letho ntle le libuka tsa rona.
We can hear him too.	Le rōna re ka mo utloa.
They will have to decide.	Ba tla tlameha ho etsa qeto.
He seemed to be thinking very hard.	O ne a bonahala a nahana ka thata haholo.
You need shoes.	U hloka lieta.
However, he and his wife have nothing left.	Leha ho le joalo, eena le mosali oa hae ha ba sa na letho.
We'll think of something else.	Re tla nahana ka se seng.
It was something new.	E ne e le ntho e ncha.
That was a few years ago.	E ne e le lilemo tse 'maloa tse fetileng.
But now it's yours.	Empa joale ke ea hau.
Look at this place.	Sheba sebaka sena.
She said she would not be able to have another child.	O ile a re a ke ke a khona ho ba le ngoana e mong.
I had questions, yes.	Ke ne ke e-na le lipotso, e.
He asked how long it had taken.	O ile a botsa hore na ho nkile nako e telele hakae.
It's not something like this again, with another man.	Ha se ntho e kang ena hape, le monna e mong.
I'll see you in thirty.	Ke tla le bona ka mashome a mararo.
He had been using it for a long time.	E ne e se e le khale a e sebelisa.
He considered going back to work.	O ile a nahana ho khutlela mosebetsing.
It comes from almost nothing.	E tsoa hoo e batlang e se letho.
Keep things in perspective.	Boloka lintho li le teng.
We need to find the truth of this.	Re hloka ho fumana 'nete ea sena.
But he loved it.	Empa o ne a e rata.
So what will he do?	Joale o tla etsa joang?
That is why they are here to do it.	Ke ka lebaka leo ba leng teng ho e etsa.
I am a man.	Ke monna.
We have a lot of time.	Re na le nako e ngata.
It's just one day.	Ke letsatsi le le leng feela.
I think they will be fine.	Ke nahana hore ba tla phela hantle.
This is useless.	Sena ha se na thuso.
He knew what it was.	O ne a tseba hore na ke eng.
It may have belonged to his wife.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe ke oa mosali oa hae.
But we have a better one.	Empa re na le betere.
It would be his last professional season.	E ne e tla ba nako ea hae ea ho qetela ea setsebi.
He was glad to have it.	O ile a thabela ho e fumana.
But don't do anything until you talk to me first.	Empa o seke wa etsa letho ho fihlela o bua le nna pele.
She loves her job.	O rata mosebetsi oa hae.
He wrote something.	O ile a ngola ho hong.
Get our idea here.	Fumana mohopolo oa rona mona.
I looked at him again.	Ke ile ka mo sheba hape.
When we come.	Ha re tla.
He entered the room.	A kena ka phaposing.
I wanted to.	Ke ne ke batla.
Your father.	Ntate oa hao .
In fact, you could see it in the bedroom.	Ha e le hantle, u ne u ka e bona ka kamoreng ea ho robala.
And you know it, too.	Mme o a e tseba, hape.
They would expect that.	Ba ne ba tla lebella seo.
People think that without water it is useless.	Batho ba nka hore ntle le metsi ha a na thuso.
You can make it as fun as you like.	U ka etsa hore e be monate kamoo u ratang kateng.
This is a real pain.	Sena ke bohloko ba sebele.
But it was not easy.	Empa ho ne ho se bonolo.
You will know.	O tla tseba.
They took him.	Ba mo nka.
If you are three years old it is very difficult.	Haeba u le lilemo li tharo ho thata haholo.
It's easy for him.	Ho bonolo ho eena.
Learning new things.	Ho ithuta lintho tse ncha.
Will you stand with us ?.	O tla ema le rona?.
Going there with Dad or with my parents.	Ho tsamaea moo le Ntate kapa le batsoali ba ka.
But it was just me.	Empa e ne e le 'na feela.
This group will be even worse next year.	Sehlopha sena se tla ba mpe haholo selemong se tlang.
At the time he was really important.	Ka nako eo o ne a hlile a le bohlokoa.
But some things take time.	Empa lintho tse ling li nka nako.
This is a regular practice.	Ena ke mokhoa oa kamehla.
That was probably the hardest part.	Seo mohlomong e ne e le sona se thata ka ho fetisisa.
You have to go back and study it.	U lokela ho khutlela morao ho ea ithuta eona.
I didn’t know things the other way around.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe lintho ka tsela e ’ngoe.
I only knew the old things.	Ke ne ke tseba lintho tsa khale feela.
But he soon realized that it would not be so.	Empa kapele o ile a hlokomela hore e ka se be ntho e joalo.
I was able to convince them that I was innocent.	Ke ile ka khona ho ba kholisa hore ha ke na molato.
But he went away very happy.	Empa o ile a tsamaea a thabile haholo.
It is better to work alone today.	Ho molemo ho sebetsa u le mong kajeno.
I expect the best.	Ke lebeletse molemo.
They may be the first ones to come forward.	E ka 'na eaba ke bona ba pele ba tlang pele.
It was amazing to watch.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang ho e shebella.
Maybe I still have it.	Mohlomong ke ntse ke e-na le eona.
He spent a few hours forgetting his problems.	O ile a qeta lihora tse seng kae a lebala mathata a hae.
It doesn't do it from me.	Ha e etse ho tloha ho nna.
I do not know.	Ha ke tsebe.
You take one thing and get another.	U nka ntho e 'ngoe ebe u fumana e 'ngoe.
I'm sorry, he said, but.	Ke masoabi, o ile a re, empa.
People love it.	Batho ba e rata.
One is not very good.	E 'ngoe ha e ntle haholo.
Then he would have done it without them.	Joale a ka be a entse ntle le ho bona.
Yes of course.	Ehlile ho joalo.
I think it comes too late.	Ke nahana hore e tla morao haholo.
You also have nothing.	Le uena u se na letho.
I will bring them tomorrow if it is to go.	Ke tla tla le tsona hosane haeba e le ho tsamaea.
We live by what we have.	Re phela ka seo re nang le sona.
What happens is emotional.	Se etsahalang ke maikutlo.
That's none of my business.	Ha se taba ea ka eo.
I'm in pain.	Ke utloa bohloko.
But, it was.	Empa, ho ne ho le jwalo.
We will be back.	Re tla khutla.
That is a very good question.	Ke potso e ntle haholo eo.
And he stood still.	Mme a ema ho feta.
To me this has been an amazing experience.	Ho 'na sena e bile ntho e makatsang e makatsang.
People may forget the questions they had.	Batho ba ka ’na ba lebala lipotso tseo ba neng ba e-na le tsona.
She was a mother.	O ne o le mme.
Many people do.	Batho ba bangata ba etsa joalo.
Maybe there is such a thing.	Mohlomong ho na le ntho e joalo.
He could but he had never tried.	O ne a ka khona empa o ne a e-so ka a leka.
Get out of there.	Tloha moo.
For some this may mean bad news.	Ho ba bang sena se ka bolela litaba tse mpe.
Often, this was not the case.	Hangata, sena e ne e se 'nete.
We will do our best.	Re tla etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
I want one, though.	Ke batla e le 'ngoe, leha ho le joalo.
While that is true, it does not really matter.	Le hoja hoo e le ’nete, ha ho na taba hakaalo.
Much like his father.	Haholo joalo ka ntate oa hae.
And they got it.	Mme ba a e fumana.
That's what it is.	Ke eona taba eo.
You have to give it up.	U tlameha ho e tlohela.
It's time for me to go.	Ke nako ea hore ke tsamaee.
I was powerless.	Ke ne ke se na matla.
He lived alone with his dog.	O ne a lula a le mong le ntja ea hae.
To me, it was always a strange thing.	Ho 'na, e ile ea lula e le ntho e makatsang.
Someone there.	O mong moo.
Do you have any questions?	O na le lipotso?
This has been a huge undertaking.	Ona e bile mosebetsi o moholo.
It will not say what they will get.	Ha ho na ho bolela hore na ba tla fumana eng.
She did not know what to expect.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a ka lebella eng.
I understand it.	Kea e utloisisa.
We can understand why.	Re ka utloisisa lebaka.
I am looking for a job.	Ke batla mosebetsi.
That is really difficult for us.	Seo se hlile se thata ho rona.
We do not like it.	Ha re e rate.
However it was too late.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e se e le morao haholo.
This was not the time to go back.	Ena e ne e se nako ea ho khutlela morao.
I ask it.	kea e botsa.
However, we are in a position to shop weekly right here.	Leha ho le joalo, re sebakeng sa ho reka beke le beke hona mona.
I always think of him as just another person.	Ke lula ke nahana ka eena e le motho e mong feela.
I open my hands.	Ke bula matsoho a ka.
It was clear that we would need help.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore re tla hloka thuso.
Many people today have a similar attitude.	Batho ba bangata kajeno ba na le maikutlo a joalo.
You can watch it here.	U ka shebella mona.
There was nothing he could say or do, of course.	Ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le buang kapa ho le etsa, ehlile.
Play.	Bapala.
Well, of course.	Hantle, ehlile.
There was no one around.	Ha ho ne ho se motho haufi.
And it should be fun every now and then.	'Me e lokela ho ba monate nako le nako.
He worked long hours.	O ne a sebetsa lihora tse telele.
They do not exist.	Ha li eo.
It kept looking at us.	E ile ea ’na ea re sheba.
Maybe a lot, or maybe not so much.	Mohlomong e ngata, kapa mohlomong ha e ngata hakaalo.
The doctor asked the woman questions.	Ngaka e ile ea botsa mosali eo lipotso.
You do not have to do this now.	Ha o a tlameha ho etsa sena hona joale.
But I still need help.	Empa ke ntse ke hloka thuso.
You must have the power to do so.	U tlameha ho ba le matla a ho etsa joalo.
I know he has questions, but he can't ask them.	Kea tseba hore o na le lipotso, empa a ke ke a li botsa.
Why he didn't come to stand with them.	Hobaneng a ne a sa tla ho ema le bona.
And you can no longer buy them.	'Me u ke ke ua hlola u li reka.
This way you will know that they are real.	Ka tsela ena u tla tseba hore ke tsa 'nete.
Tell it to do things.	E bolelle ho etsa lintho.
And take what you like.	'Me u nke seo u se ratang.
To know the problems of the day well.	Ho tseba hantle mathata a letsatsi.
I was sad to do so.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko ho etsa joalo.
That was obvious.	Seo se ne se hlakile.
Never mind that at all.	Le ka mohla ha ho na taba eo hanyane.
We did not.	Re ne re se na .
There was something wrong here.	Ho ne ho ena le phoso mona.
There is something wonderful about that.	Ho na le ntho e ntle haholo ka seo.
More often than not.	Hangata ho feta moo.
When was it?	E ne e le neng?
However, you do not want to work there.	Leha ho le joalo, ha u batle ho sebetsa moo.
I think it's good.	Ke nahana hore e ntle.
I didn't think it was a good idea.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore ke mohopolo o motle.
That would be fun.	Hoo ho ka ba monate.
It's an old phone.	Ke mohala oa khale.
You should see it.	O lokela ho e bona.
I thought it was fun.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho monate.
It did not happen very often.	Ha ea ka ea etsahala hangata.
It was an easy day.	E bile letsatsi le bonolo.
If you have a child there you want the best.	Haeba u ne u e-na le ngoana moo u batla se molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Do not think that they have them.	U se ke ua nahana hore ba na le tsona.
We want their money.	Re batla chelete ea bona.
Important feedback.	Maikutlo a bohlokoa.
Every day, every day.	Letsatsi le leng le le leng, le le leng.
It seemed fun.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho le monate.
They are just human beings.	Ke batho feela.
This is not easy to do.	Sena ha se bonolo ho se etsa.
Yes of course.	Ehlile ho joalo.
He had only one request to make to me.	O ne a na le kopo e le 'ngoe feela eo a lokelang ho e etsa ho 'na.
Never doubt it.	O seke oa e belaela le ka mohla.
This can take hours.	Sena se ka nka lihora.
He had to win.	O ne a lokela ho hlola.
I wouldn’t be able to do things like that, though.	Ke ne nke ke ka khona ho etsa lintho tse joalo, leha ho le joalo.
There were thirty children in each group.	Ho ne ho e-na le bana ba mashome a mararo sehlopheng ka seng.
I feel.	Ke ikutloa.
This is not something anyone should look for.	Sena ha se letho leo motho a lokelang ho le batla.
We say.	Re re.
The first.	Ea pele.
I never heard from him again.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke utloa letho ka eena.
Sometimes, when he is not there, they talk about it.	Ka nako e 'ngoe, ha a le sieo, ba bua ka eona.
What it is.	Seo e leng sona.
I mean he was the one who was going.	Ke bolela hore ke eena ea neng a tsamaea.
Apparently he has decided to retire.	Ho bonahala eka o entse qeto ea ho tlohela mosebetsi.
You would have seen it!	U ka be u e bone!
There, it is better.	Moo, ho molemo.
That seems like a possibility.	Seo se bonahala e le sebaka se ka etsahalang.
We can know this.	Sena re ka se tseba.
And some of these things you would like to say.	Le lintho tse ling tsa mofuta ona tseo u ka ratang ho li bolela.
I love your books, though.	Ke rata libuka tsa hao, leha ho le joalo.
In a sense, you are wrong.	Ka tsela e itseng, ke uena ea phoso ka uena.
No, there was no alternative.	Che, ho ne ho se na mokhoa o mong.
That's all.	Ho joalo feela.
I love you.	Kea u rata.
See how happy she is.	Bona hore o thabile.
There seemed to be problems all the time.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho e-na le mathata ka linako tsohle.
Have a nice day !.	Eba le letsatsi le monate!.
He decided that was not the case.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hore ha ho joalo.
Well, close enough to it.	Be, haufi ho lekana ho eona.
It was the only way to see a doctor.	E ne e le eona feela tsela ea ho bona ngaka.
And maybe not necessary.	'Me mohlomong ha ho hlokahale.
I started to cry.	Ke ile ka qala ho lla.
Just a book.	Buka feela.
Why not go now? 	Ke hobane'ng ha u sa tsamaee hona joale?
.	.
However, this was my chance to.	Leha ho le joalo, ona e ne e le monyetla oa ka oa ho.
There 'there'.	Ke moo 'moo'.
I had no idea why.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng.
You know what happened.	U tseba se neng se etsahala.
Let's see what they can do.	A re bone hore na ba ka etsa’ng.
Some children beg when they return home from school.	Bana ba bang ba kopa ha ba khutlela hae ba tsoa sekolong.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Ke masoabi hore e tlameha ho fihla ho sena.
He did not eat.	O ne a sa je.
You certainly are not very good.	Ka sebele ha u motle haholo.
Many people believe she is innocent.	Batho ba bangata ba lumela hore ha a na molato.
Since then, things have been going well.	Ho tloha ka nako eo, lintho li ntse li tsamaea joalo.
Be with your friends.	E-ba le metsoalle ea hau.
But everyone else seemed to have a good time.	Empa ba bang kaofela ba ne ba bonahala ba na le nako e monate.
They will be talking nearby.	Ba tla be ba bua haufi.
And there it is.	Mme ke eo.
Now he had nothing.	Joale o ne a se a se na letho.
Asking what happened.	Ho botsa hore na ho etsahetseng.
I just looked at him.	Ke ile ka mo sheba feela.
Good and bad things.	Lintho tse ntle le tse mpe.
I know it will happen just as it did.	Ke a tseba e tla etsahala kamoo e etsahetseng kateng.
It is not very easy to say.	Ha ho bonolo haholo ho bua.
But that is when something amazing happened.	Empa ke ha ho etsahala ntho e makatsang.
The process is simple.	Mokhoa ona o bonolo.
And maybe that was good.	Mme mohlomong hoo ho ne ho le molemo.
I could hear them.	Ke ne ke khona ho li utloa.
That was a return.	Eo e bile ho khutla.
I can still play.	Ke ntse ke khona ho bapala.
But we can enjoy what we have here and now.	Empa re ka thabela seo re nang le sona mona le hona joale.
It works for me.	E sebetsa ho nna.
Only once a week.	Hang ka beke feela.
He is as great as you are.	O moholo joalo ka uena.
Probably a risk as well.	Mohlomong kotsi le eona.
I really have enough money for that, he thought.	Ka sebele ke na le chelete e lekaneng bakeng sa seo, o ile a nahana.
I've been thinking about you.	esale ke nahana ka wena.
It was the first time I had seen that man.	Ke ne ke qala ho bona monna eo.
Then he did a good thing.	Eaba o etsa ntho e ntle.
The police are not sure what to do.	Mapolesa ha a na bonnete ba hore na a etse eng.
Which is a very bad thing.	E leng ntho e mpe haholo.
Something for tomorrow.	Ntho e 'ngoe bakeng sa hosane.
I do not speak.	Ha ke bue.
You can go back and look at everyone.	U ka khutlela morao 'me ua sheba motho kaofela.
But it wasn’t just a few years ago.	Empa e ne e se lilemo tse seng kae tse fetileng.
It was so.	Ho bile jwalo.
Thank you, my friends.	Kea leboha, metsoalle ea ka.
I want to be sure.	Ke batla ho ba le bonnete.
Because they can see it.	Hobane ba khona ho e bona.
So that it can be.	E le hore ho ka ba jwalo.
Our job is to fix it.	Mosebetsi oa rona ke ho e lokisa.
The ceremony lasted about a week.	Mokete ona o ile oa nka hoo e ka bang beke.
It wasn’t an old place, it was my place.	E ne e se sebaka sa khale, e ne e le sebaka sa ka.
You were there.	U ne u le teng.
Exactly what this situation requires.	Hantle feela hore na boemo bona bo hloka eng.
He didn't like it very much.	O ne a sa rate haholo.
We had no money to look good.	Re ne re se na chelete ea ho shebahala hantle.
Another week ahead of us.	Beke e 'ngoe ka pele ho rona.
I made my decision.	Ke entse qeto ea ka.
He doesn't care what it is.	Ha a tsotelle hore na ke eng.
Before their name.	Pele ho lebitso la bona.
Do not be afraid to ask questions.	U se ke ua tšaba ho botsa lipotso.
It was silly to say it.	E ne e le ntho e hlokang kelello ho e bua.
Of course they will do it in a good way !.	Ehlile ba tla e etsa ka tsela e ntle !.
I loved my father.	Ke ne ke rata Ntate.
Then, he thought.	Joale, o ile a nahana.
I'm so glad we decided to let her go.	Ke thabile haholo hore ebe re entse qeto ea hore a tsamaee.
I have never seen this method.	Ha ke so bone mokhoa ona.
And now, he refuses.	Mme jwale, a hana.
Something important and not so.	Ntho ea bohlokoa le e seng joalo.
I know you know things.	Kea tseba hore u tseba lintho.
Everyone is so cute.	E mong le e mong o motle haholo.
In just a few days.	Ka matsatsi a 'maloa feela.
I'm done thinking now.	Ke qetile ho nahana joale.
I'm not hard on that kind of thing.	Ha ke thata ka ntho ea mofuta oo.
Very much with a man.	Haholo le monna.
It's not right.	Ha se hantle.
With everything you may need to go a little further.	Ka ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe eo u ka e hlokang ho tsamaea hanyane.
Then sleep.	Joale ho robala.
And so it is.	Mme ho jwalo.
It benefited both of us.	E ile ea re tsoela molemo ka bobeli.
I do not know what you are talking about.	Ha ke tsebe hore na u bua ka eng.
She almost came back crying.	O ile a batla a khutla a lla.
Now what is theirs.	Joale ke eng ea bona.
So much.	Haholo.
I want to be a guy who is a girl.	Ke batla ho ba mohlankana eo e leng ngoanana.
I, too, was traveling.	Le 'na, ke ne ke tsamaea.
It is a thing and it is nothing at once.	Ke ntho mme ha se letho ka nako e le 'ngoe.
I don't know because no one told me.	Ha ke tsebe hobane ha ho motho ea ileng a mpolella.
After that.	Ka mor'a moo.
How is yours?	Ea hau e joang.
He loved it.	O ne a e rata.
It was his first.	E ne e le ea hae ea pele.
I can tell you it is important.	Nka u bolella hore e bohlokoa.
Start using them again.	Qala ho li sebelisa hape.
I received a very interesting letter from him last week.	Ke fumane lengolo le monate haholo ho tsoa ho eena bekeng e fetileng.
One chance per person.	Monyetla o le mong ka motho.
I hope you do a better job.	Ke tšepa hore u tla etsa mosebetsi o betere.
I would love to do that.	Nka thabela ho etsa joalo.
The young man began to cry.	Mohlankana eo a qala ho lla.
Of course, they did not start with it.	Ha e le hantle, ha baa ka ba qala ka eona.
He did it.	O e entse.
It's really beautiful.	E ntle ruri.
It has been such a week for me.	E bile beke ea mofuta oo ho 'na.
Which is a very difficult thing to do.	E leng ntho e thata haholo ho e etsa.
He started first.	O ile a qala pele.
You have to go back.	U tlameha ho khutlela morao.
You hope others believe you.	U tšepa hore ba bang baa u lumela.
I like my food.	Ke rata lijo tsa ka.
How do we get there? 	Re fihla joang moo?
He loved his family, his friends and his food.	O ne a rata lelapa la hae, metsoalle ea hae le lijo.
asked the girl.	ha botsa ngoanana.
Their life must have been very difficult and then mine would have been easier.	E tlameha ebe bophelo ba bona bo ne bo le boima haholo ’me joale ba ka bo ne bo le bonolo.
You need to keep busy.	U lokela ho lula u phathahane.
She has problems.	O na le mathata.
And think of my father now.	Mme nahana ka ntate jwale.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
He could hear it.	O ne a khona ho e utloa.
But that would benefit his family even more.	Empa seo se ne se tla tsoela lelapa la hae molemo o moholo.
It is also important here.	Ho bohlokoa hape mona.
Of course.	Ho hlakile.
The real question is how to do it.	Potso ea sebele ke mokhoa oa ho etsa joalo.
They do it.	Bona ba e etsa.
Sometimes it is difficult to know where to start.	Ka linako tse ling ho thata ho tseba ho qala.
None of us want to suffer.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea batlang ho utloa bohloko.
The place was not ideal.	Sebaka seo e ne e se se setle.
It is no longer yours.	Ha e sa le ea hao.
Error staying too close.	Phoso ya ho dula haufi haholo.
I'd like to go out with you again.	Ke kopa ho tsoa le uena hape.
If not, it's really a man.	Haeba che, ha e le hantle ke monna.
It is no longer necessary for him.	Ho hang ha ho sa hlokahala haholo bakeng sa hae.
I knew something was coming.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ho na le ntho e tlang.
I made a mistake.	Ke entse phoso.
It has to be true.	E lokela ho ba 'nete.
We both talked at the same time.	Ka bobeli re ile ra bua ka nako e le 'ngoe.
She was devastated, and our son was devastated.	O ne a utloile bohloko ’me mora oa rōna a utloa bohloko.
That was very difficult.	Seo se ne se se thata haholo.
I will tell you what will happen.	Ke tla o bolella se tlang ho etsahala.
I had no idea.	Ke ne ke sa nahane.
It was too late to go back now.	E ne e se e le morao haholo ho khutlela morao joale.
And that, too, is there.	Mme hoo, hape, ho teng.
My job was only a matter of time.	Mosebetsi oa ka e ne e le taba ea nako feela.
They don't think like us.	Ha ba nahane joalo ka rona.
If things do not go your way, plan ahead for better times.	Haeba lintho li sa tsamaee ka tsela eo u e batlang, rera esale pele bakeng sa linako tse molemo.
They work from home.	Ba sebetsa ba le hae.
I had never thought about it.	Ke ne ke e-s'o ka ke nahana ka eona.
This was their fault.	Ena e ne e le phoso ea bona.
Maybe we already are.	Mohlomong re se re ntse re le teng.
Not to mention pain without pain.	Ho se bue bohloko ntle le bohloko.
I felt tired, but in a good way.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke khathetse, empa ka tsela e ntle.
He was not sleeping well.	O ne a sa robala hantle.
Maybe you should finish it.	Mohlomong o lokela ho e qeta.
They were not looking at him.	Ba ne ba sa mo sheba.
You will have to think of something else.	U tla tlameha ho nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I've never seen that.	Ha ke eso bone seo.
I think they are very good.	Ke nahana hore li ntle haholo.
Finally you can see.	Qetellong o ka bona.
It was him.	E ne e le eena.
And it really is.	'Me ho hlile ho joalo.
Do the amazing things you love to do.	Etsa lintho tse makatsang tseo u ratang ho li etsa.
I did not comment.	Ha kea ka ka fana ka maikutlo.
So that's what you can do.	Kahoo ke seo u ka se etsang.
However, there is no picture.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho setšoantšo.
Who wants to drive?	Ke mang ea batlang ho khanna?
You know, people ask about that.	O ya tseba, batho ba botsa ka seo.
I don't think that's a bad thing.	Ha ke nahane hore ke taba e mpe.
I love watching people eat.	Ke rata ho shebella ha batho ba ja.
You have no problem.	Ha u na bothata.
But we see the situation we are in.	Empa re bona boemo boo re leng ho bona.
Date of all kinds.	Letsatsi la mofuta o mong le o mong.
We'll see how it happens.	Re tla bona hore na ho tla etsahala joang.
He drank it.	O ne a mo noa.
They will not return.	Ba sa tla khutla.
The woman looked at him intently.	Mosali eo a mo sheba ka hloko.
No, that was not good.	Che, hoo ho ne ho se molemo.
Nobody wants it, everyone has to have it.	Ha ho motho ea e batlang, e mong le e mong o tlameha ho ba le eona.
People love this.	Batho ba rata sena.
He is working.	O ntse a sebetsa.
He just said he didn't want to.	O itse feela ha a batle.
The same goes for mine.	Ho joalo le ka ea ka.
However, it is still very bad what he did.	Leha ho le joalo, e ntse e le mpe haholo seo a se entseng.
The man asked, "What time do you open?"	Monna a botsa, "o bula nako mang?"
Well, we're sorry to leave.	Be, re masoabi ha u tsamaea.
I still have it.	Ke ntse ke e-na le eona.
People play them, spend them, and forget about them.	Batho ba li bapala, ba li qeta, 'me ba li lebala.
We talked about how beautiful she was.	Re ile ra bua kamoo a neng a le motle kateng.
And his people.	Le batho ba hae.
But it could be.	Empa e ne e ka ba joalo.
To look good is to feel good.	Ho shebahala hantle ke ho ikutloa hantle.
It was so much fun though.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo leha ho le joalo.
When it came out, it was so beautiful.	Ha e tsoa, ​​​​e ne e le ntle haholo.
I did not continue with them.	Ha kea ka ka tsoela pele le bona.
They certainly could not walk.	Ka sebele ba ne ba ke ke ba tsamaea ka maoto.
It's very simple.	E bonolo haholo.
They never forget.	Ha ba ke ba lebala.
It gave him a reason to live.	E ile ea mo fa lebaka la ho phela.
But, this was very easy to do.	Empa, sena se ne se le bonolo haholo ho se etsa.
He got an opinion.	O ile a fumana maikutlo.
In fact, you never said anything.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho mohla u kileng ua bua letho.
We were, rather than in it.	Re ne re le ba, ho ena le ho ho eona.
I just say things and people can take them or leave them.	Ke bolela feela lintho mme batho ba ka li nka kapa ba li tlohela.
And we know it well.	Mme re e tseba hantle.
That was important.	Seo e ne e le sa bohlokoa.
Where there is nothing.	Moo ho seng letho.
It works well with me.	E sebetsa hantle le nna.
He went into the bedroom.	A kena ka phaposing ya ho robala.
I love those baby ages.	Ke rata lilemo tseo tsa ngoana.
Now we all suffer.	Hona joale kaofela re utloa bohloko.
We can't afford it right now.	Re ke ke ra khona ho e lefa hona joale.
We have nothing.	Ha re na letho.
I don't know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke eng.
Life is not so simple.	Bophelo ha bo bonolo hakaalo.
The news is still going on.	Litaba li ntse li tsoela pele.
He used the time to drink.	O ile a sebelisa nako eo ho noa.
The food is bad.	Lijo li mpe.
Life needs it.	Bophelo bo a bo hloka.
The danger is imminent.	Kotsi e haufi.
By Mother.	Ka 'Mè.
I was glad to be able to help.	Ke ile ka thabela ho khona ho thusa.
And that didn't work.	Le seo ha se a ka sa sebetsa.
To know more about him.	Ho tseba haholoanyane ka eena.
However, I do not know what it is.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hore na ke eng.
I get the same kind of thing now.	Ke fumana mofuta o tšoanang oa ntho hona joale.
I thought it was good.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho molemo.
I'd rather not talk about it.	Ha ke batle ho bua ka eona.
I called my husband.	Ke ile ka letsetsa monna oa ka.
People start walking.	Batho ba qala ho tsamaea.
She no longer needs to fear her husband.	Ha aa lokela ho hlola a tšaba monna oa hae.
There was a serious accident.	Ho bile le kotsi e mpe haholo.
I will not be able to catch him.	Ha ke na ho khona ho mo tšoara.
Tell your parents that you love them.	Bolella batsoali ba hao hore ua ba rata.
The style that had to play.	Mokhoa o neng o tlameha ho bapala.
The most amazing place.	Sebaka se makatsang ka ho fetisisa.
We'll start with them first.	Re tla qala ka bona pele.
It no longer seems so heavy.	Ha e sa bonahala e le boima hakaalo.
We found people who understood that.	Re fumane batho ba neng ba utloisisa seo.
Better yet.	Ho feta hantle.
We want to try to save it if we can.	Re batla ho leka ho e boloka haeba re khona.
But it is not necessary.	Empa ha ho hlokahale.
He will write down everything that happens tonight.	O tla ngola tsohle tse etsahalang bosiung bona.
He did not want to do this.	O ne a sa batle ho etsa sena.
He was the first to pay.	Ke eena ea ileng a lefa pele.
No one was skeptical.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a belaela.
But it is not an easy task.	Empa hase mosebetsi o bonolo.
It was really easy.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le bonolo.
You need to pay your way.	U hloka ho lefa tsela ea hau.
At times, they even met.	Ka linako tse ling, ba ne ba kopana.
But he knew there was nothing he could do.	Empa o ne a tseba hore ha ho letho leo a ka le etsang.
Many people saw us.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba re bona.
I was so happy that they did.	Ke ne ke thabile haholo hore ebe ba entse joalo.
I have a dog that is my baby.	Ke na le ntja eo ke ngoan'a ka.
We will be happy to stay another time.	Re tla thabela ho lula hape ka nako e 'ngoe.
He made it seem easy.	O ile a etsa hore ho bonahale ho le bonolo.
The children do the same.	Bana ba etsa joalo.
He has been helping his mother for years.	E se e le lilemo a thusa 'mè oa hae.
They work well together.	Ba sebetsa hammoho hantle.
But we talk about it a lot.	Empa re e bua haholo.
He was getting there.	O ne a fihla moo.
I realized that I too was important.	Ke ile ka bona hore le ’na ke oa bohlokoa.
This is one of them.	Ena ke e 'ngoe ea tsona.
People want to think about it.	Batho ba batla ho nahana ka eona.
It works.	E ea sebetsa.
We can use you.	Re ka u sebelisa.
In Mom's room, of course.	Ka kamoreng ea 'Mè, ka 'nete.
He kept walking.	A tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke na bonnete.
He was there and he was mine.	O ne a le teng mme e ne e le wa me.
I understand why this works.	Kea utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha sena se sebetsa.
I fixed the whole thing.	Ke ile ka lokisa taba eo kaofela.
And that's a good thing.	Mme ntho e ntle.
No one could know.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka tseba.
I tried to call her but could not get in.	Ke ile ka leka ho mo letsetsa empa ka sitoa ho kena.
I no longer want to be that person.	Ha ke sa batla ho ba motho eo.
You do not know how to do it.	Ha o tsebe ho e etsa.
What we were, for many years.	Seo re neng re le sona, ka lilemo tse ngata.
Stop! 	Ema!
His was simple.	Ea hae e ne e le bonolo.
And you will.	'Me u tla etsa joalo.
Or walking.	Kapa ho tsamaea.
They are in a difficult time.	Ba nakong e boima.
I wish he would have been there to ask.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka be a le teng ho botsa.
But we also just took it.	Empa le rona re ile ra e nka feela.
Her phone was ringing.	Mohala oa hae o ne o ntse o lla.
That he did not give up.	Hore ha a ka a tlohela.
You have to think ahead.	U tlameha ho nahana esale pele.
However, he continued to drive his car.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a tsoela pele ho khanna koloi ea hae.
I did not know when she would be.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na o tla ba neng.
I would have loved him.	Nka be ke ile ka mo rata.
There’s a telling me we can do better.	Ho na le ho mpolella hore re ka etsa betere.
Someone is doing it.	Motho e mong o etsa joalo.
I did not see him coming.	Ha kea ka ka bona eo a tlang.
And that's a good thing.	Mme ke ntho tse ntle tseo.
No one else had that kind of power.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a e-na le matla a mofuta oo.
Everything else is fun to have.	Tse ling tsohle li monate ho ba le tsona.
It was just me.	E ne e le nna feela.
Probably not.	Mohlomong o ne a sa fihlela letho.
Sometimes, you have to take a chance.	Ka linako tse ling, u tlameha ho nka monyetla.
In fact, he was very demanding.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a batla haholo.
Many people came and went.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba tla ’me ba tsamaea.
But they were strong first.	Empa ba ne ba le matla pele.
He wanted to be alone.	O ne a batla ho ba mong.
I think we need to know more about that.	Ke nahana hore re hloka ho tseba haholoanyane ka seo.
Maybe I'll be arrested now.	Mohlomong ke tla tšoaroa joale.
Yes, even more so now.	E, le ho feta hona joale.
It used to be his money.	E kile ea e-ba chelete ea hae.
And now people are going to read it.	'Me joale batho ba il'o e bala.
It all goes together in a beautiful place.	Tsohle li tsamaea hammoho sebakeng se setle.
But he probably won't try that place.	Empa mohlomong a ke ke a leka sebaka seo.
He may have made the decision on that occasion.	E ka 'na eaba o ne a entse qeto ka mokete oo.
Now everyone is alive.	Hona joale bohle ba ntse ba phela.
But they were there.	Empa ba ne ba le teng.
Don't tell me you didn't tell me.	U se ke ua mpolella hore ha ua ka ua mpolella.
I don't know what he did to you.	Ha ke tsebe seo a o entseng sona.
They want this.	Ba batla sena.
He would need his place.	O ne a tla hloka sebaka sa hae.
We all know the place.	Kaofela re tseba sebaka seo.
Which was true enough.	E neng e le 'nete ho lekana.
We will understand this.	Re tla utloisisa sena.
You know it's coming, and it's coming.	Le a tseba e a tla, mme e a tla.
And there is no reason why it should exist.	Hape ha ho na lebaka leo ka lona e lokelang ho ba teng.
I know nothing about that.	Ha ke tsebe letho ka seo.
Well on time, too.	Hantle ka nako, hape.
It would not be human.	E ka be e se motho.
You finally get there and it feels like before.	Qetellong u fihla moo 'me e ikutloa joaloka pele.
I don't care if I do that once again.	Ha ke na taba le ho etsa hoo hang hape.
He can speak, but he does not speak.	O khona ho bua, empa ha a bue.
They may return soon.	Ba ka khutla haufinyane.
Probably a lot of time.	Mohlomong nako e ngata.
In the end, we work hard but we play harder.	Qetellong, re sebetsa ka thata empa re bapala ka thata ho feta.
They have something to say.	Ba na le seo ba se buang.
It was the first time I had seen him continue that way.	Ke ne ke qala ho mo bona a tsoela pele ka tsela eo.
So, for so long.	Kahoo, nako e telele hakana.
I have been using it ever since.	Haesale ke e sebelisa ho tloha ka nako eo.
We must read it.	Re tlameha ho e bala.
Of course, the mind and the truth do not mix.	Ha e le hantle, kelello le 'nete ha li kopane.
The real thing is what it is.	Ntho ea sebele ke seo e leng sona.
I know you can.	Kea tseba hore u ka khona.
What it needs.	Seo e se hlokang.
But they soon began asking questions.	Empa kapele ba ile ba qala ho botsa lipotso.
I'm so sorry, so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo, masoabi haholo.
People just want to believe.	Batho ba batla ho lumela feela.
Take these things home with you.	Tsamaea le lintho tsena hae.
I can't talk to you.	Ha ke khone ho bua le uena.
Sadly it was him.	Ke masoabi e ne e le eena.
They do not know how to get started.	Ha ba tsebe mokhoa oa ho qala.
I have never met these people.	Ha ke eso kopane le batho bana.
He did not know what to do.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na o tla etsa eng.
But only in this area.	Empa feela sebakeng sena.
This question is very difficult for me.	Potso ena e thata haholo ho 'na.
Surely, it should not be that strange.	Ka sebele, ha ea lokela ho ba ntho e makatsang joalo.
At the time I did not know this.	Ka nako eo ke ne ke sa tsebe sena.
And we.	'Me re .
He spent several hours there.	O ile a qeta lihora tse ’maloa moo.
The last one is my favorite.	Ea ho qetela ke eo ke e ratang haholo.
None of them worked.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona e ileng ea sebetsa.
The day of his power.	Letsatsi la matla a hae.
They have a good location.	Ba na le sebaka se setle.
But they are still going.	Empa ba ntse ba tsamaea.
And you can continue from there.	'Me u ka tsoela pele ho tloha moo.
These are people.	Bana ke batho.
They have to go out and try a lot of things.	Ba tlameha ho tsoa le ho leka lintho tse ngata.
You do not know how long these things last.	Ha o tsebe hore na lintho tsena li nka nako e kae.
Besides, she could not walk.	Ntle ho moo, o ne a sa khone ho tsamaea.
You look just like him.	U shebahala joaloka eena feela.
It would work because it makes no sense.	E ne e tla sebetsa hobane ha e na kelello.
I could feel that.	Ke ne ke utloa seo.
I still have that problem.	Ke ntse ke na le bothata boo.
If so, life will be easier.	Haeba ho joalo, bophelo bo tla ba bonolo.
Thanks for the feedback.	Ke leboha maikutlo.
And he had nothing better to do.	Mme o ne a se na letho le betere leo a ka le etsang.
I'll see it tomorrow night.	Ke tla e bona hosane bosiu.
There are no problems at all.	Ho hang ha ho na mathata.
You too are alive.	Le wena o a phela.
As he wanted it to be.	Joalo ka ha a ne a batla hore ho be joalo.
But no hands, either.	Empa ha ho na matsoho, le hona.
The children love them too.	Bana le bona ba a ba rata.
He told me he did.	O ile a mpolella hore o entse joalo.
Looking for problems.	Ho batla mathata.
Your thoughts, questions and comments are important.	Maikutlo, lipotso le maikutlo a hau li bohlokoa.
They live it.	Ba e phela.
It does not seem to fit.	Ha e bonahale e lekana.
That's the new way.	Ke eona tsela e ncha.
I have no problem.	Ha ke na bothata.
But I am happy now.	Empa ke thabile hona joale.
We do this as.	Re etsa sena joalo ka .
He did not want to talk about his condition.	O ne a sa batle ho bua ka boemo ba hae.
But last year was one of those years.	Empa selemong se fetileng e ne e le se seng sa lilemo tseo.
This trend continues.	Mokhoa ona o ntse o tsoela pele.
He didn't have to go now.	O ne a sa tlameha ho tsamaea joale.
I was there too.	Ke ne ke le teng hape.
We conclude that he is to blame.	Re etsa qeto ea hore ke eena ea molato.
Thank you !!.	Kea leboha !!.
That was a thought, though.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo, leha ho le joalo.
Something important and not so.	Ntho ea bohlokoa le e seng joalo.
Her children were not mine.	Bana ba hae e ne e se ba ka.
However, mere prediction is not enough.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bolela esale pele feela ha hoa lekana.
And anyone can do it.	Mme mang kapa mang a ka e etsa.
Buy something.	Reka ho hong.
I mean his mother.	Ke bolela mme wa hae.
I have a son about your age.	Ke na le mora ea ka bang lilemo tsa hao.
Think about what is important to you.	Nahana ka seo e leng sa bohlokoa ho uena.
Where do you live, my son?	U lula kae, mora oa ka?
Kids have to learn, you know.	Bana ba tlameha ho ithuta, ua tseba.
I didn’t want to think about it.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho nahana ka eona.
If there was something there, he would get it.	Haeba ho ne ho e-na le ntho e teng moo, o ne a tla e fumana.
He found it difficult to stay.	O ile a fumana ho le thata ho lula.
From then on, he lived with his mother.	Ho tloha ka nako eo, o ile a lula le ’mè oa hae.
What and what they went through when they were in school.	Seo le seo ba fetileng ho sona ha ba le sekolong.
He wanted to go with us.	O ne a batla ho tsamaea le rōna.
Some will come and get it.	Ba bang ba tla ho tla e nka.
And so it is.	Mme ho jwalo.
This trend continues today.	Mokhoa ona o ntse o tsoela pele ho fihlela kajeno.
I have a son.	Ke na le mora.
I called once, it never will.	Ke ile ka letsetsa hang, ha ho sa tla ba joalo.
It was very difficult to walk.	Ho ne ho le thata haholo ho tsamaea.
He loved her by the head.	O ile a mo rata ka hlooho.
We will ask the doctor.	Re tla botsa ngaka.
He was busy planning ahead.	O ne a ntse a phathahane a rera esale pele.
My son was in another room.	Mora oa ka o ne a le ka kamoreng e 'ngoe.
Her stomach starts to get heavier and heavier.	Mpa ea hae e qala ho ba boima le ho feta.
I wish they could see it.	Ke lakatsa hore ba e bone.
At that time,	Ka nako eo,
It was about to go.	Ho ne ho se ho tsamaea.
You could probably see them clearly.	Mohlomong u ne u ka ba bona hantle.
The walk was long but fun.	Ho tsamaea ho ne ho le telele empa ho le monate.
So it can be seen.	Kahoo ho ka bonahala.
He did not understand what was going on.	O ne a sa utloisise se etsahalang.
I'm as sorry as you.	Ke masoabi joaloka uena.
I can ask you the same question.	Nka u botsa eona potso eo.
We thought the same way.	Re ne re nahana ka tsela e tšoanang.
The reason for this is very simple.	Lebaka la sena le bonolo haholo.
We gave our best.	Re ile ra fana ka sohle seo re ka se khonang.
I had to think fast.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho nahana kapele.
The last moment passed.	Nako ea ho qetela e ile ea feta.
It should all come.	Le lokela ho tla kaofela.
Probably even more so.	Mohlomong joalo le ho feta.
In fact, they did.	Ha e le hantle, ba ile ba etsa joalo.
It can't do that.	E ke ke ea etsa joalo.
He had gone to his room.	O ne a ile kamoreng ea hae.
Some did both.	Ba bang ba ile ba li etsa ka bobeli.
He stands up.	O a ema.
In particular, it is very difficult to catch us.	Haholo, ho thata haholo ho re tšoara.
It has something with its baby.	E na le ntho le ngoana oa eona.
He said he knew nothing.	A re ha a tsebe letho.
Something to look for	Ntho eo u lokelang ho e batla
They saw what they wanted to see.	Ba ile ba bona seo ba batlang ho se bona.
Then we will decide what to do.	Joale re tla etsa qeto ea hore na re etse eng.
I needed to hear him speak.	Ke ne ke hloka ho mo utloa ha a bua.
I stopped to help her.	Ke ile ka ema ho mo thusa.
But he did not think so.	Empa o ne a sa nahane joalo.
I really should.	Ke hlile ke lokela.
He tried drinking coffee, but to no avail.	O ile a leka ho noa kofi, empa seo ha sea ka sa thusa.
Do well.	Etsa hantle.
And they certainly did.	Mme ehlile ba etsa jwalo.
It was not very difficult, or not very easy.	E ne e se thata haholo, kapa e se bonolo haholo.
There was no question of falling.	Ho ne ho se potso ea ho oa.
I don't see anyone else.	Ha ke bone motho e mong.
So we asked him first, but there was some problem with that.	Kahoo re ile ra mo botsa pele, empa ho ne ho e-na le bothata bo itseng ka seo.
It is not enough.	Ha hoa lekana.
Only that it is difficult to do so.	Feela hore ho thata ho etsa joalo.
Do not like it.	U se ke ua e rata.
And there I am.	Mme ke nna eo.
They do not exist.	Ha li teng.
If he loves them, he will come back to you.	Haeba a li rata, o tla khutlela ho uena.
But this works very well.	Empa sena se sebetsa hantle haholo.
Or start the other way.	Kapa qala ka tsela e 'ngoe.
Many were weeping.	Ba bangata ba ne ba lla.
If not, it offers the opportunity to do it for you.	Haeba ha ho joalo, e fana ka monyetla oa ho u etsetsa eona.
So, good job.	Kahoo, mosebetsi o motle.
His style was good.	Mokhoa oa hae o ne o le motle.
I just wanted to tell you the good news.	Ke ne ke batla ho le bolella litaba tse molemo feela.
Instead, ask questions.	Ho e-na le hoo, botsa lipotso.
I can't say when.	Ha ke khone ho bolela hore na ke neng.
But next week will be there.	Empa beke e tlang e tla ba teng.
He just walked in.	A kena feela.
It could be better, though, and it works better.	E ka ba betere, leha ho le joalo, 'me e sebetsa hantle.
As such, he cannot.	Joalo ka ha ho le joalo, ha a khone.
This was more of a problem than he had anticipated.	Sena e ne e le bothata ho feta kamoo a neng a lebeletse.
Now, you see how important that was.	Joale, u bone hore na e ne e le ea bohlokoa hakae.
I can buy a new house.	Nka reka ntlo e ncha.
He had to leave her.	O ile a tlameha ho mo tlohela.
They are out of place.	Ba tsoa sebakeng.
But, in the end, he said nothing.	Empa, qetellong, ha aa ka a bua letho.
There was life, and it is not.	Ho ne ho e-na le bophelo, 'me ha ho sa le joalo.
It worked very well for that man.	E ile ea sebetsa hantle haholo ho monna eo.
No one could.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka khona.
There is enough space there.	Ho na le sebaka se lekaneng moo.
But he said it would not happen.	Empa o itse e ke ke ea etsahala.
Because he does not know.	Hobane ha a tsebe.
I want to feel good.	Ke batla ho ikutloa ke le monate.
I'm not even sure that that could happen.	Ha ke na bonnete le hore hoo ho ka etsahala.
The baby was crying.	Ngoana o ne a lla.
He finally did it.	Qetellong o e entse.
Notice what happens.	Hlokomela se etsahalang.
Here is my problem.	Bothata ba ka ke bona.
There was nothing else for him here.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng bakeng sa hae mona.
One of them would have been bad enough.	E 'ngoe ea tsona e ka be e bile mpe ka ho lekaneng.
It can be anything.	E ka ba eng kapa eng.
I'm sorry last night.	Ke masoabi ka bosiu bo fetileng.
They seemed to love to sing.	Ba ne ba bonahala ba rata ho bina.
We must continue with our work now.	Re tlameha ho tsoela pele ka mosebetsi oa rona hona joale.
You can write.	U ka ngola.
And so you are even more confident.	'Me kahoo u tšepa le ho feta.
I'm not talking about power, either.	Ha ke bue ka matla, le hona.
A few more can be good.	Tse ling tse 'maloa e ka ba tse ntle.
It still belongs to me.	E ntse e le ea ka.
They thought they were in danger.	Ba ne ba nahana hore ba kotsing.
I got right into something.	Ke ile ka kena hantle ho ntho e itseng.
Even though the police did not seem to know what they wanted.	Leha e le hore mapolesa a ne a bonahala a sa tsebe seo a se batlang.
He could not stay to see what he had done to her.	O ne a sitoa ho lula ho bona seo a mo entseng sona.
But it was not, because it was not necessary.	Empa ho ne ho se joalo, hobane ho ne ho sa hlokahale.
I did not want that.	Ke ne ke sa batle seo.
I believe in a higher power.	Ke lumela ho matla a phahameng.
But he still kept talking.	Empa leha ho le joalo o ile a tsoela pele ho bua.
Easy to get started.	Ho bonolo ho qala.
The question is whether it is important to me.	Potso ke hore na ke ea bohlokoa ho 'na.
He found nothing.	Ha aa ka a fumana letho.
She lives alone now.	O lula a le mong hona joale.
However, this was still going to take time.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se ne se ntse se tla nka nako.
The man finished drinking.	Monna a qeta ho noa.
But my book is still there.	Empa buka ea ka e ntse e le teng.
He feels very uncomfortable with the phone.	O ikutloa a le thata haholo ka mohala.
But it's really hard.	Empa ehlile ho thata.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Haho phoso ho seo.
Yet water has its mind, its way it has to take.	Leha ho le joalo metsi a na le kelello ea 'ona, tsela ea 'ona eo a lokelang ho e nka.
After a long search, he found it!	Ka mor’a ho e batla nako e telele, o ile a e fumana!
But do not be ashamed.	Empa u se ke ua ba lihlong.
Which happened last year.	E leng se etsahetseng selemong se fetileng.
And other things, too.	Le lintho tse ling, hape.
It is never too late.	Ha ho mohla e leng morao haholo.
The son becomes the father, and the father becomes the son.	Mora e ba ntate, mme ntate e ba mora.
I said she looked better with clothes.	Ke ne ke re o shebahala a le betere ka liaparo.
He works.	O sebetsa.
He looked at his hands.	A sheba matsoho a hae.
If you do not get it now, you will never get it.	Haeba u sa e fumane hona joale, ha ho mohla u tla e fumana.
That's when life was good.	Ke ha bophelo bo ne bo le monate.
I expect you to stay this week.	Ke lebeletse hore o tla lula bekeng ena.
In the same way a man comes, thank you.	Ka tsela e tšoanang monna o tla, kea leboha.
He said he wanted to try to write it on his own.	A re o batla ho leka ho e ngola a le mong.
It hurts even more.	Ho bohloko le ho feta.
But he would do so very carefully.	Empa o ne a tla etsa joalo ka hloko haholo.
The party was in the morning.	Mokete o ne o le hoseng.
Just apply and go.	Etsa kopo feela 'me u tsamaee.
I would do anything for you.	Ke ne ke tla u etsetsa eng kapa eng.
But he knew what was going to happen.	Empa o ne a tseba se tla etsahala.
No he will not.	Che a ke ke a etsa joalo.
Some were fun, but most were not.	Tse ling li ne li le monate, empa tse ngata li ne li se joalo.
We can start with the fourth.	Re ka qala ka ea bone.
He no longer wanted a job.	O ne a se a sa batle mosebetsi.
Or trying to ask.	Kapa a leka ho botsa.
I can't stand it.	Ha ke khone ho ema.
But we did it.	Empa re e entse.
We know how to do it.	Re tseba ho e etsa.
We had nothing in common.	Re ne re se na letho leo re tšoanang ka lona.
Simple but powerful.	E bonolo empa e le matla.
But do not think of that as a suggestion.	Empa u se ke ua nka seo e le tlhahiso.
Being alone in everything.	Ho ba mong ho tsohle.
We stood in front.	Re ile ra ema ka pele.
Or because of you.	Kapa ka lebaka la hao.
It made me think of my mother.	E ile ea etsa hore ke nahane ka ’Mè.
And you can just see it.	'Me u ka e bona feela.
This is useful but not necessary.	Sena se na le thuso empa ha se hlokahale.
For the first time, they love it.	Lekhetlo la pele, baa e rata.
He spent a lot of time on it.	O qetile nako e telele ho eona.
Living with so many people was not easy.	Ho phela le batho ba bangata hakana ho ne ho se bonolo.
I can't imagine.	Ha ke khone ho nahana.
They're coming out.	Ba ntse ba tsoa.
And if things do not go well.	'Me haeba lintho li sa tsamaee hantle.
I don't know why he doesn't speak.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a sa bue.
These shoes look great on you.	Lieta tsena li shebahala li le ntle haholo ho uena.
First of all, what could have happened was news to him.	Taba ea pele, ntho e neng e ka etsahala e ne e le litaba ho eena.
These people know how to live.	Batho bana ba tseba ho phela.
Amazing.	E makatsang.
It was so beautiful.	E ne e le ntle haholo.
He just worked.	O sa tsoa sebetsa.
This is often not the case.	Hangata sena hase 'nete.
To me, that is the only way to get there.	Ho 'na, ke eona feela tsela ea ho fihla moo.
She is near now.	O haufi le jwale.
It was more about us than about you.	E ne e bua haholo ka rona ho feta ka uena.
But it is.	Empa ho joalo.
I told him a good job.	Ke ile ka mo bolella mosebetsi o motle.
Schoolchildren may still be present.	E ka 'na eaba bana ba sekolo ba ntse ba le teng.
And they never thought.	Mme ho hang ba ne ba sa nahane.
Finally, he will arrive.	Qetellong, o tla fihla.
Walking the dog has never been so fun !.	Ho tsamaea ntja ha ho mohla ho kileng ha e-ba monate hakaalo!.
However, he was a very good father.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le ntate ea molemo haholo.
I think everyone should know that.	Ke nahana hore bohle ba lokela ho tseba seo.
Just for fun really.	Feela bakeng sa monate e le hantle.
Find a picture of her to write to her.	Fumana setšoantšo sa hae ho mo ngola.
They stood alone.	Ba ile ba ema ba le bang.
It was hard, it was hard.	Ho ne ho le thata, ho le thata.
I had taken it.	Ke ne ke e nkile.
Within a few days it was working fine.	Pele ho matsatsi a 'maloa e ne e sebetsa hantle.
He may even agree.	A ka ba a lumela.
He said he was always your man.	O itse o kile a ba motho oa hau kamehla.
You are no longer drinking.	Ha u sa noa.
His style is not fun.	Mokhoa oa hae ha o monate.
He continued on foot.	A tsoela pele ka tsela ea maoto.
You will be.	U tla ba.
He never said why.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bolela lebaka.
He was very tired, and he just wanted to go home.	O ne a khathetse haholo, ’me o ne a batla ho khutlela hae feela.
The memory was great.	Mohopolo o ne o le moholo.
You would no longer hear good news from him.	U ne u ke ke ua hlola u utloa litaba tse monate ho tsoa ho eena.
The young man looked even better.	Mohlankana eo o ne a shebahala hantle le ho feta.
I like our team.	Ke rata sehlopha sa rona.
But how to buy it.	Empa mokhoa oa ho e reka.
And she thanked him.	Mme a leboha.
In fact, it is my money.	Ha e le hantle, ke chelete ea ka.
It will never do that.	Le ka mohla e ke ke ea etsa joalo.
Finally he opened the door and went inside.	Qetellong a bula lemati mme a kena.
It worked alone.	Ho ne ho sebetsa a le mong feela.
Often, you do not care.	Hangata, ha o tsotelle seo.
Anything you need.	Eng kapa eng eo o e hlokang.
Of course, we can talk now if you like.	Ehlile, re ka bua hona joale ha o rata.
We have a good one.	Re na le e 'ngoe e ntle.
I was able to save it until next year.	Ke ne ke khona ho e boloka ho fihlela selemong se tlang.
None of them did anything.	Ha ho le a mong wa bona ya entseng letho.
In fact, it is just fine.	Ka 'nete, e ntle feela.
He wanted to know, he had to know.	O ne a batla ho tseba, a tlameha ho tseba.
He wanted to know what he wanted to know.	O ne a batla ho tseba seo a batlang ho se tseba.
Take that thing.	Nka ntho eo.
I tried to approach him.	Ke ile ka leka ho ea ho eena.
I knew he agreed.	Ke ne ke tseba hore oa lumela.
I'm done, she thought.	Ke qetile, a nahana.
He has nothing to do with us.	Ha a na taba le rona.
And the last one is mine.	'Me ea ho qetela ke ea ka.
My parents refused to attend.	Batsoali ba ka ba ile ba hana ho tla.
I had a reason.	Ke ne ke na le lebaka.
Of the festival.	Ea mokete.
There is no other.	Ha ho e mong.
So everyone knew the Father.	Kahoo bohle ba ne ba tseba Ntate.
Then you will be guilty.	Joale u tla be u le molato.
No one spoke to me.	Ha ho motho ya ileng a bua le nna.
I could not see the way.	Ke ne ke sa bone le tsela ea eona.
We knew it was a powerful practice at the time.	Re ne re tseba hore e ne e le mokhoa o matla ka nako eo.
That's a second impression.	Ke maikutlo a bobeli.
That's why he came in.	Ke kahoo a ileng a kena.
He could not walk as usual.	O ne a sa khone ho tsamaea joalo ka kamehla.
Too many.	Tse ngata haholo.
And the mother too.	Le mme hape.
I hope you get a job.	Ke tšepa hore u tla fumana mosebetsi.
It will be the same again.	Ho tla ba jwalo hape.
That is where the problem lies.	Ke hona moo bothata bo leng teng.
Let it be so.	Ho be joalo.
I started to really enjoy it.	Ke ile ka qala ho e thabela haholo.
There is no chance of learning by trial and error.	Ha ho monyetla oa ho ithuta ka ho leka le ka phoso.
Of course you may not need them.	Ha e le hantle u ka 'na ua se ke ua li hloka.
He slept there.	A robala moo.
But he knew.	Empa o ne a tseba.
Knowing this you do not need to think.	Ho tseba sena ha ho hlokahale hore u nahane.
Can you travel on time?	A na u ka tsamaea ka nako?
However, he would already have the money.	Leha ho ka ba joalo, o ne a tla be a se a ntse a le ka chelete.
He was on time.	O ne a le ka nako.
It was like a car accident.	E ne eka ke kotsi ea koloi.
They have to know what he is doing.	Ba tlameha ho tseba seo a se etsang.
He cannot live without water.	A ke ke a phela ntle le metsi.
And he slept.	Mme a robala.
But in just a few days.	Empa ka matsatsi a 'maloa feela.
I know it very well.	Ke e tseba haholo.
Who he wants.	Eo a e batlang.
And on.	Mme ho ya pele.
He worked hard.	O ne a sebetsa ka thata.
Some of the same as in the past.	Tse ling tse tšoanang le tsa nakong e fetileng.
She did not like the man.	O ne a sa rate monna eo.
But it was water.	Empa e ne e le metsi.
It's hard to do.	Ho thata ho etsa.
You may like that.	O ka rata seo.
I can trust them.	Nka ba tšepa.
This was the law.	Ona e ne e le molao.
With each picture, he started with a strong thought.	Ka setšoantšo se seng le se seng, o ile a qala ka mohopolo o matla.
She had never been alone with a boy before.	O ne a e-s'o ka a lula a le mong le moshanyana pele.
And much of this has happened to me.	Mme haholo ka tsela ena ho bile le nna.
She was crying near my house.	O ne a lla haufi le ntlo ea ka.
wife of.	mosali oa.
It was not his way.	E ne e se tsela ya hae.
My husband tells us to go.	Monna oa ka o re a re tsamaee.
That was not a problem.	Seo ha sea ka sa e-ba bothata.
They want to have a party.	Ba batla ho etsa mokete.
I just think so.	Ke nahana feela hore ho joalo.
And so on.	Joalo joalo.
You can sleep again.	U ka robala hape.
I think you probably need to sleep.	Ke nahana hore mohlomong u hloka ho robala.
I can't even.	Ha ke khone le.
I have others.	Ke na le ba bang.
When we come back you can have them.	Ha re khutla u ka ba le tsona.
Because you do not know.	Hobane ha o tsebe.
We have a hard time understanding how to win.	Re na le bothata ba ho utloisisa mokhoa oa ho hlola.
It was really weird what happened.	E ne e hlile e le ntho e makatsang se etsahetseng.
I like this one the most.	Ke rata ena ka ho fetisisa.
If you want to know more, please check this site.	Haeba u batla ho tseba haholoanyane, ka kopo sheba sebaka sena.
Work and money go hand in hand.	Mosebetsi le chelete li tsamaea hammoho.
Of course, that did not happen.	Ha e le hantle, ha hoa ka ha e-ba joalo.
This was not my idea.	Ena e ne e se mohopolo oa ka.
This thing?	Ntho ena?
I refused to pay him.	Ke ile ka hana ho mo lefa.
I would never have my old life back.	Ke ne ke sa tl'o hlola ke e-ba le bophelo ba ka ba khale.
It's nice to have.	Ho monate ho ba le.
This is my favorite time.	Ena ke nako eo ke e ratang haholo.
Some things only take time.	Lintho tse ling li nka nako feela.
He is a very handsome man.	Ke monna ya motle haholo.
He did not give it to her.	Ha aa ka a mo fa eona.
And it was good for me.	Mme ho ne ho le molemo ho nna.
He certainly had friends, family.	Ka sebele o ne a e-na le metsoalle, lelapa.
You will be here.	U tla ba mona.
He took everything from me.	O nkile tsohle ho nna.
And no one else did.	Hape ha ho e mong ea kileng a etsa joalo.
I would just leave you there.	Nka mpa ka o tlohela moo.
One place is food.	Sebaka se seng ke lijo.
He also had no time to think.	Hape o ne a se na nako ea ho nahana.
We will want him to love us as we are.	Re tla batla hore a re rate kamoo re leng kateng.
We can't stay.	Re ke ke ra lula.
I don't even want to see it right.	Ha ke batle le ho o bona hantle.
No, the same thing can happen.	Che, ntho eo le eona e ka etsahala.
Caring takes time.	Ho hlokomela ho hloka nako.
His book was not so good.	Buka ea hae e ne e se ntle hakaalo.
I do not know what to say or do.	Ha ke tsebe hore na nka o bolella eng kapa ke etse eng.
But in the end he was there.	Empa qetellong o ne a le teng.
That means to live.	Hoo ho bolela ho phela.
Best think so.	Molemo ka ho fetisisa nahana joalo.
Give your help.	Fana ka thuso ea hau.
Walk out.	Ho tsoa.
It was not long before the mother had a baby.	Ha hoa ka ha feta nako e telele pele ’mè eo a ba le ngoana.
It was nice to meet you.	Ho bile monate ho kopana le wena.
He spends all his time reading.	O qeta nako eohle ea hae a bala.
Something strange is happening here.	Ho na le ntho e makatsang e etsahalang mona.
However, it is clear that this situation is very serious.	Leha ho le joalo, ho hlakile hore boemo bona bo matla haholo.
Stand in your place.	Ema sebakeng sa hao.
However, more than that.	Leha ho le joalo, ho feta moo.
It was an important issue.	E ne e le taba ea bohlokoa.
The man finally decided on his return.	Qetellong monna eo o ile a etsa qeto ea ho khutlela ha hae.
So just look.	Kahoo sheba feela.
Current situation.	Boemo hona joale.
He had no time to think that way.	O ne a se na nako ea ho nahana joalo.
Please have a good time.	Ke kopa o be le nako e monate.
That is mine.	Eo ke ea ka.
He took care of us all in his own way.	O ile a re hlokomela kaofela ka tsela ea hae.
It is very clear.	E hlakile haholo.
He was very nice.	O ne a le monate haholo.
He could not be.	O ne a ke ke a ba teng.
I want to look for him.	Ke batla ho mo batla.
I didn't want her parents to know about us.	Ke ne ke sa batle hore batsoali ba hae ba tsebe ka rōna.
This is not just an issue.	Sena ha se taba feela.
We took advantage of the opportunity.	Re ile ra sebelisa monyetla oo.
Sleeping with my husband at night.	Ho robala le monna oa ka bosiu.
We will never find it in it again.	Re ke ke ra e fumana hape ho eona.
If you study hard, you will do well.	Haeba u ithuta ka thata, u tla sebetsa hantle.
You may want to visit her soon.	U ka rata ho mo etela haufinyane.
We've seen people with children.	Re bone batho ba nang le bana.
I saw the book from there.	Ke ile ka bona buka ho tloha moo.
You have to be mindful of this.	U tlameha ho ba le kelello ka sena.
Get her to believe him.	Etsa hore a mo lumele.
I hope you like staying here.	Ke tšepa hore u rata ho lula mona.
No, you did not.	Che, ha ua ka ua etsa joalo.
Can anyone do that.	Na motho a ka etsa joalo.
They said they loved us.	Ba itse baa re rata.
It did so in advance.	E entse joalo esale pele.
They certainly do.	Ka sebele ba etsa joalo.
Surprisingly, he gave up.	Ho makatsang ke hore o ile a e tlohela.
I don't know what's going on.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ho etsahalang.
It was just a place to stand.	E ne e le sebaka sa ho ema feela.
He said he knew.	A re oa tseba.
However, we cannot go back.	Leha ho le joalo, re ke ke ra khutlela morao.
People were returning to work.	Batho ba ne ba khutlela mosebetsing.
And so we went ahead.	Mme kahoo ra ya pele.
This type is equivalent to a family name.	Mofuta ona o lekana le lebitso la lelapa.
It's a very simple idea.	Ke mohopolo o bonolo haholo.
It helps to be present.	E thusa ho ba teng.
There was an accident.	Ho bile le kotsi.
This must happen.	Sena se tlameha ho etsahala.
And that he takes care of it.	Le hore oa e hlokomela.
It is still the first days.	E ntse e le matsatsi a pele.
Getting to them will be easier.	Ho fihla ho bona ho tla ba bonolo.
I really like these things.	Ke hlile ke rata lintho tsena.
One player does not form a team.	Sebapali se le seng ha se etse sehlopha.
Tell them they are doing a good job.	Ba bolelle hore ba etsa mosebetsi o motle.
And he noticed something.	Mme a hlokomela se seng.
Her children were studying hard.	Bana ba hae ba ne ba ithuta ka thata.
He will sleep here tonight.	O tla robala mona bosiung bona.
You probably haven't tried anything.	Mohlomong ha ua ka ua leka ho hong.
He knew that.	O ne a tseba seo.
They always treat her like a child.	Ba lula ba mo tšoara joaloka ngoana.
They were very simple.	Ba ne ba le bonolo haholo.
It was the worst.	E ne e le mpe ka ho fetisisa.
Many of them can be that age.	Ba bangata ba bona ba ka ba lilemo tseo.
I want to do it for you and take care of you.	Ke batla ho o etsetsa le ho o hlokomela.
He used to come here a lot with his family.	O ne a tloaetse ho tla mona haholo le lelapa la hae.
They could not do that.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba etsa hoo.
He started writing a book.	O ile a qala ho ngola buka.
We are hurt.	Re utloile bohloko.
When he heard this, he wept.	Ha a utloa sena, a lla.
If that is what it is.	Haeba ke seo e leng sona.
Finding what you need to get.	Ho fumana seo u lokelang ho se fumana.
Well, he had it.	Be, o ne a e-na le eona.
But we are the children.	Empa ke rona bana.
People in the past would know better.	Batho ba nakong e fetileng ba ne ba ka tseba hantle.
I tried to speak.	Ke ile ka leka ho bua.
It is very important to him.	E bohlokoa haholo ho eena.
People come to the party.	Batho ba tla moketeng.
No one ever told me anything.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a mpolella letho.
Many people believe she is alive.	Batho ba bangata ba lumela hore o ntse a phela.
The food was delicious.	Lijo li ne li le monate.
Things have to happen the way they happen.	Lintho li tlameha ho etsahala ka tsela eo li etsahalang ka eona.
Before they can come and ask us.	Pele ba ka tla ho tla re botsa.
I love that girl.	Ke rata ngoanana eo.
This certainly does.	Ka sebele ena e etsa joalo.
They never met again.	Ha ba ka ba hlola ba kopana hape.
No one was going to try to catch him.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tla leka ho mo tšoara.
It still doesn't get it.	E ntse e sa e fumane.
I can live without one of them.	Nka phela ntle le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
I went back to it.	Ke ile ka khutlela ho eona.
To me, watching them is fun.	Ho 'na, ho li shebella ho monate.
I just want to have my son.	Ke batla feela ho ba le mora oa ka.
And it is better to do so.	'Me ho molemo hore u etse joalo.
They do not walk hard.	Ha ba tsamaee ka thata.
I have had so many once.	Ke bile le tse ngata joalo hang.
It was not for everyone and for everyone.	E ne e se ya motho le ya motho e mong le e mong.
From there, you will find nothing.	Ho tloha moo, ha ho letho leo u tla le fumana.
I enjoyed that book.	Ke thabetse buka eo.
But he did not need to tell them what it was.	Empa o ne a sa hloke ho ba bolella hore na ke eng.
And sometimes he did not have the strength to go on living.	’Me ka linako tse ling o ne a se na matla a ho tsoela pele a phela.
Then he left.	Eaba oa tsamaea.
However, there is no alternative.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho na mokhoa o mong.
Or her hair.	Kapa moriri oa hae.
It is more than enough.	Le feta ho lekana.
He had never been there.	O ne a eso be teng.
All or nothing.	Tsohle kapa ha ho letho.
He did not treat each of us well.	Ha aa ka a tšoara e mong le e mong oa rōna hantle.
Then he went home.	Eaba o ea hae.
Like what your name is.	Joalo ka hore na lebitso la hau ke mang.
They did not notice anything strange.	Ha baa ka ba hlokomela letho le makatsang.
Now what.	Joale ke eng.
We live here now.	Re lula mona hona joale.
Each time, he said the same thing.	Nako le nako o ne a bua ntho e tšoanang.
He loved to speak well.	O ne a rata ho bua hantle.
I went out to look.	Ke ile ka tsoa ho ea sheba.
But it is because of who they are.	Empa ke ka lebaka la seo ba leng sona.
I handed him a letter.	Ke ile ka mo fa lengolo.
That is what we want to achieve.	Ke sona seo re batlang ho se fihlela.
There is no money.	Chelete ha e eo.
We can take one player.	Re ka nka sebapali se le seng.
Please, keep holding.	Ka kopo, tsoela pele ho tšoara.
He made his best decision.	O ile a etsa qeto ea hae e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
It is a fact that no one wants to talk about.	Ke 'nete eo ho seng motho ea batlang ho bua ka eona.
But it seems very clear.	Empa e bonahala e hlakile haholo.
Some ideas you may want to know.	Mohopolo o mong o ka lakatsa ho o tseba.
The other was just production time.	E 'ngoe e ne e le nako ea tlhahiso feela.
Even more fun.	Maikutlo a monate le ho feta.
Thanks again, for everything.	Kea leboha hape, ka tsohle.
I start to doubt my mind.	Ke qala ho belaela kelello ea ka.
However it is important.	Leha ho le joalo ho bohlokoa.
I took care of them.	Ke ile ka ba hlokomela.
You both need to log in to use these.	Ka bobeli le hloka ho kena ho sebelisa tsena.
If he is not there, nothing will happen.	Haeba a le sieo, ha ho letho le tla etsahala.
Work is in progress.	Mosebetsi o ntse o tsoela pele.
This is not fun.	Sena ha se monate.
But that is where you need to start.	Empa ke hona moo o lokelang ho qala teng.
Indeed, it was his way of life.	Ka sebele, e ne e le tsela ea hae ea bophelo.
It's not money.	Ha se chelete.
You need to make sure you keep them properly.	U lokela ho etsa bonnete ba hore u li boloka hantle.
I can't do one job.	Ha ke khone ho etsa mosebetsi o le mong.
And there is a reason.	Mme ho na le lebaka.
It was no more important to what it was than what it was.	E ne e se ea bohlokoa ho seo e neng e se sona ho feta seo e neng e le sona.
Probably for the best.	Mohlomong bakeng sa molemo ka ho fetisisa.
Walking long after dinner.	Ho tsamaea nako e telele ka mor'a lijo tsa mantsiboea.
So we decided to give it up.	Kahoo re ile ra etsa qeto ea ho e tlohela.
He had no friends there.	O ne a se na metsoalle moo.
I told him he didn't live there.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore ha a lule moo.
It does not address this issue.	Ha e bue ka taba ena.
They want a girl they can talk to.	Ba batla ngoanana eo ba ka buang le eena.
It's too late to get that, now.	Ho se ho le morao ho fumana seo, jwale.
He is helpful to me.	O na le thuso ho nna.
The room was empty, but it would work fine.	Kamore eo e ne e se na letho, empa e ne e tla sebetsa hantle.
Until they have to go there.	Ho fihlela ba tlameha ho ea moo.
Know that there is nothing wrong with you.	Tseba hore ha ho letho le phoso ka uena.
I'm not sure why that is.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore na ke hobane'ng ha ho le joalo.
I can live.	Nka phela.
Ultimately, one has to make a decision.	Qetellong, motho o tlameha ho etsa qeto.
Then he heard it all.	Joale o ne a utloa tsohle.
He didn't need to.	O ne a sa hloke.
And it is useless.	Mme ha ho na thuso.
Try to get back to work.	Leka ho khutlela mosebetsing.
I like to play that way.	Ke rata ho bapala ka tsela eo.
They will have to decide.	Ba tla tlameha ho etsa qeto.
Until last night.	Ho fihlela maobane bosiu.
I told you this.	Ke le boleletse sena.
After no.	Ka mor'a che.
Every day you learn something new.	Letsatsi le letsatsi o ithuta ntho e ncha.
I'll pay you next week.	Ke tla o lefa bekeng e tlang.
I needed to talk.	Ke ne ke hloka ho bua.
There is only one way to fix this problem.	Ho na le mokhoa o le mong feela oa ho lokisa bothata bona.
But he did not really catch us.	Empa ha e le hantle ha aa ka a re tšoara.
Not many people know about this.	Hase batho ba bangata ba tsebang ka sena.
Which was real.	E neng e le hantle.
he thought.	a nahana.
But that was not what you thought.	Empa e ne e se seo o se nahanang.
I'm sorry about you, now.	Ke masoabi ka uena, joale.
I think he can help you.	Ke nahana hore a ka o thusa.
Here it does not seem so.	Mona ha ho bonahale ho le joalo.
However, they did not need water.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ne ba sa hloke metsi.
He never talked about his job.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka mosebetsi oa hae.
He began to open.	A qala ho bula.
I wish he could have been there.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka be a bile teng.
The morning of the fourth day.	Hoseng ha letsatsi la bone.
Eventually, we would have to buy our own house and start a family.	Qetellong re ne re tla reka ntlo ea rōna ebe re qala lelapa la rōna.
I am very happy with this book.	Ke thabile haholo ka buka ena.
We can't take this.	Re ke ke ra nka sena.
I hope we can do it next year.	Ke tšepa hore re ka e etsa selemong se tlang.
But this time he returned home.	Empa ka nako ena o ile a khutlela hae.
I have it.	Ke na le eona.
You are not one of them.	Ha u e mong oa bona.
Drive carefully.	Khanna ka hloko.
Then he gave it to her.	Eaba oa mo fa eona.
What have you done with your life?	Ke eng eo u e entseng ka bophelo ba hau?
I just want to see if he is home.	Ke mpe ke bone hore na o teng hae.
And look where they are today.	Mme sheba moo ba leng teng kajeno.
I mean we are not sure.	Ke bolela hore ha re na bonnete.
One is simple.	E 'ngoe e bonolo.
I mean that.	Ke bolela seo.
Or to talk about it.	Kapa ho bua ka eona.
It is still a pain in the ear.	E ntse e le bohloko ba tsebe.
For her.	Bakeng sa hae.
That news was true.	Litaba tseo e ne e le ’nete.
As long as he could see and hear, the opportunity was there.	Ha feela a ne a ka bona le ho utloa, monyetla o ne o le teng.
You hear it.	Ua e utloa.
It didn't seem to matter.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na taba.
We are stronger than you.	Re matla ho o feta.
I know him well.	Ke mo tseba hantle.
At one point, it was really nice to be with someone with me.	Ka lekhetlo le leng, ho ne ho hlile ho le monate ho ba le motho le 'na.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
Not standing, not speaking, just doing it.	E seng ho ema, ho se bue, ho e etsa feela.
It is truly a wonderful place to be.	Ruri ke sebaka se setle ho ba ho sona.
There were no books.	Ho ne ho se na libuka.
We'll tell you what the problems are first.	Re tla u bolella hore na mathata a teng pele.
It seemed clear.	E ne e bonahala e hlakile.
I wish there was someone else.	Ke lakatsa eka ho ka be ho na le motho e mong.
And we didn't know them beforehand.	Mme re ne re sa ba tsebe pele ho nako.
It makes me want to see it more.	E etsa hore ke batle ho e bona haholo.
I do not understand how I should go now.	Ha ke utloisise hore na ke lokela ho ea joang hona joale.
He did not know anyone.	O ne a sa tsebe motho.
Once they had a greater chance than that.	Hang ha ba ne ba e-na le monyetla o moholo ho feta oo.
Probably to him.	Mohlomong ho eena.
All of us family, really.	Kaofela ha rona lelapa, ruri.
Yes, you will never know what you are doing to begin with.	E, u ke ke ua tseba seo u se etsang ho qala ka.
What do we know about these people?	Re tseba eng ka batho baa?
There will never be another one like our boy.	Ha ho sa tla hlola ho e-ba le e mong ea tšoanang le moshanyana oa rōna.
They may be talking about something.	Ba ka 'na ba bua ka ntho e itseng.
He doesn't want to do anything about me.	Ha a batle ho etsa letho ka nna.
You have to work to earn money.	U tlameha ho sebetsa hore u fumane chelete.
And here we see nothing.	Mme mona ha re bone letho.
They have their own ideas.	Ba na le maikutlo a bona.
I can use your help in this.	Nka sebelisa thuso ea hau ho sena.
I'll call you in the morning.	Ke tla o letsetsa hoseng.
I heard you speak.	Ke u utloile u bua.
He was not sure which one was strange.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke efe e makatsang.
She said she didn't like him.	O ile a re ha a mo rate.
It would.	Ho ne ho tla etsa joalo.
So why did you do that?	Joale ke hobane'ng ha u entse joalo?
It looks good to me.	E shebahala hantle ho nna.
Those things were not enough.	Lintho tseo li ne li sa lekana.
They wouldn't know about that.	Ba ka be ba sa tsebe ka seo.
I get this.	Ke fumana sena.
He had no place to do so.	O ne a se na sebaka sa ho etsa joalo.
We are all together.	Kaofela re kopane.
You must stay with us.	O lokela ho dula le rona.
Which is too long.	E leng nako e telele haholo.
I need to find more.	Ke hloka ho fumana tse ling.
You should try it.	U lokela ho e leka.
I had the same issue.	Ke ne ke e-na le eona taba ena.
I did not watch him as he did this.	Ha kea ka ka shebella ha a ntse a etsa sena.
If we find no one there, that's fine.	Haeba re fumana ho se motho moo, ho molemo.
Good ones too.	Tse ntle le tsona.
Of course this was something we never thought of.	Ehlile sena e ne e le ntho eo re neng re sa e nahana.
The process is simple.	Mokhoa ona o bonolo.
I did not want to forget one thought of her.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho lebala mohopolo o le mong oa hae.
He was very good at it.	O ne a le motle haholo ka eona.
There was no time for that.	Ho ne ho se na nako ea seo.
Nowhere did he get that.	Ha ho moo a ileng a fihla teng ka seo.
The food was fresh and very tasty.	Lijo li ne li le ncha 'me li monate haholo.
He did just that.	O entse joalo.
Nothing we asked for was ever a problem.	Ha ho letho leo re ileng ra le kōpa le kileng la ba bothata.
He always passes by us.	O lula a feta ha rōna.
Yes, this is a good picture.	E, sena ke setšoantšo se setle.
Then, do what you think is right.	Joale, etsa seo u se nahanang hantle.
There is every school.	Ho na le sekolo se seng le se seng.
Seeing and hearing new things.	Ho bona le ho utloa tse ncha.
Who will do this for you.	Ke mang ea tla u etsetsa sena.
They will begin to believe in it if you use this method.	Ba tla qala ho lumela ho eona haeba u sebelisa mokhoa ona.
It was really a good thing.	E ne e hlile e le ntho e ntle.
Tell.	Bolella.
I wish they could do that.	Ke lakatsa eka ba ka etsa joalo.
Believe it or not, you are not alone.	Lumela kapa che, ha u mong.
One cannot exist without the other.	E 'ngoe e ke ke ea ba teng ntle le e' ngoe.
Do so often.	Etsa joalo haholo.
And this they live.	Mme sena ba se phela.
They wanted to return home.	Ba ile ba batla ho khutlela hae.
He just hoped it wasn't him.	O ne a tšepa feela hore e ne e se eena.
It was a wonderful time living there.	E ne e le nako e monate ea ho phela moo.
You do not know who you will meet.	Ha o tsebe hore na o tla kopana le mang.
I'll get back to it.	Ke tla khutlela ho eona.
That's how I felt.	Ke kamoo ke neng ke ikutloa kateng.
He said when he did it.	O itse ha a e etsa.
Breakfast was delicious.	Lijo tsa hoseng li ne li le monate.
It's that simple.	Ho bonolo joalo.
And the good news is, you can get out of it.	Mme litaba tse monate ke hore, o ka tsoa ho eona.
I did not pay for everything.	Ha kea ka ka lefa tsohle.
Every man had a family.	Monna e mong le e mong o ne a e-na le lelapa.
I wonder where he lives now.	Kea ipotsa hore na o lula kae hona joale.
All the kids love you.	Bana bohle ba o rata.
I will not be able to see them.	Ha ke na ho khona ho ba bona.
If you have done this thank you.	Haeba u entse sena kea leboha.
It was a bit difficult.	Ho ne ho batla ho le boima.
He saw this as a vehicle for that.	O ile a bona sena e le koloi bakeng sa seo.
They started very early in the morning.	Ba ile ba qala hoseng haholo.
He was tired.	O ne a khathetse.
He did not do so, although he did not know exactly why.	Ha a ka a etsa joalo, leha a ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
I can't walk.	Ha ke khone ho tsamaea.
People were good.	Batho ba ne ba le molemo.
We don't have to do anything tonight.	Ha re a tlameha ho etsa letho bosiung bona.
I have never thought of that way.	Ha ke so nahane ka mokhoa oo.
I think he does a lot for her.	Ke nahana hore o mo etsa haholo.
You have nothing fun to say about it.	Ha u na letho le monate leo u ka le buang ka letho.
Now, they knew.	Joale, ba ne ba tseba.
You have to have money to get started.	U tlameha ho ba le chelete ho qala.
I want more.	Ke batla haholo.
See what happens when you work hard?	Le bona se etsahalang ha o sebetsa ka thata?
Which can certainly be fun to have.	Eo ka sebele e ka bang monate ho ba le eona.
I had heard him at night.	Ke ne ke mo utloile bosiu.
He had been here.	O ne a bile mona.
Maybe no one was good enough.	Mohlomong ho ne ho se motho ea molemo ka ho lekaneng.
That will tell you what is wrong.	Seo se tla u bolella hore na phoso ke efe.
They can tell you all about him.	Ba ka u bolella tsohle ka eena.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
Let me tell you something.	Ke u bolelle ho hong.
There was not enough room for all the people.	Ho ne ho se sebaka se lekaneng sa ho lula hantle.
I knew my job.	Ke ne ke tseba mosebetsi oa ka.
But now he knew what to do.	Empa joale o ne a tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
It was the second time.	E ne e le lekhetlo la bobeli.
Please, comment on why.	Ka kopo, maikutlo a hore na hobaneng.
Give important feedback.	Fana ka maikutlo a bohlokoa.
Take care of our children.	Hlokomela bana ba rona.
And it worked.	'Me e ne e sebetsa.
I just know it.	Kea e tseba feela.
I had to do.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho etsa.
This means that we can learn something about his innocence.	Sena se bolela hore re ka ’na ra ithuta ho hong ka ho hloka molato ha hae.
You have never done that.	Ha o eso etse seo.
I do not need a job.	Ha ke hloke mosebetsi.
But everyone had their own problem.	Empa e mong le e mong o ne a e-na le bothata ba hae.
I love this idea.	Ke rata mohopolo ona.
Of course, they did not know.	Ha e le hantle, ba ne ba sa tsebe.
Maybe I even played with it a little bit.	Mohlomong ke bile ke bapala le eona hanyane.
Some of them are obvious.	Tse ling tsa tsona li hlakile.
I just have to take it.	Ke mpe ke e nke.
It was what he wanted.	E ne e le seo a neng a se batla.
I love working there.	Ke rata ho sebetsa moo.
I left, just once.	Ke ile ka tloha, hang feela.
Well, that's exactly what we want, too.	Be, ke hantle seo re se batlang, le rona.
Once they do, my team takes over.	Hang ha ba etsa joalo, sehlopha sa ka se nka sebaka.
To me it seems we have a very nice car today.	Ho 'na ho bonahala eka re na le koloi e ntle haholo kajeno.
We see them every day.	Re ba bona letsatsi le letsatsi.
She was the first woman to handle the situation.	E bile mosali oa pele oa ho tšoara boemo boo.
Because here it is again.	Hobane ke ena hape.
The man looked back.	Monna eo a sheba morao.
However, no one is around.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho ea haufi.
We have to go.	Re lokela ho tsamaea.
And we did that.	Mme re ne re etsa seo.
Everyone knows what thinking is.	E mong le e mong oa tseba hore na ho nahana ke eng.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
I like that place.	Ke rata sebaka seo.
Everyone knows someone.	Motho e mong le e mong o tseba motho.
The law was not about who loved him the most.	Molao e ne e se hore na ke mang ea mo ratang ka ho fetisisa.
So very early to think about them.	Kahoo pele haholo ho nahana ka bona.
You are going to love it.	O ya o rata.
This means you need to read more.	Sena se bolela hore u lokela ho bala haholoanyane.
This coffee is very good.	Kofi ena e ntle haholo.
Thanks to him.	Ke leboha eena.
What they do with me is not really important.	Seo ba se etsang le 'na ha se bohlokoa hakaalo.
More than once, probably.	Ho feta hang, mohlomong.
You may like it.	U ka e rata.
And he didn't want to have it.	Hape o ne a sa batle ho ba le eona.
They all went home happy.	Bohle ba ile ba ya hae ba thabile.
Everyone talks about it and nobody does anything about it.	E mong le e mong o bua ka eona mme ha ho motho ea etsang letho ka eona.
Of course not, he thought.	Ehlile ha ho joalo, o ile a nahana.
Like my job and my stuff.	Joalo ka mosebetsi oa ka le lintho tsa ka.
We are very tough !.	Re na le thata haholo!.
There are a few who would like both.	Ho na le ba 'maloa ba ka ratang ka bobeli.
I've seen it.	Ke e bone.
And it will be.	Mme ho tla ba jwalo.
But you live a long time with it.	Empa u phela nako e telele le eona.
I did not want to know for sure.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho tseba hantle.
We all go.	Kaofela rea ​​tsamaea.
To date, no one has talked to me about it.	Ho fihlela kajeno, ha ho motho ea kileng a bua le ’na ka eona.
Then again, that was me the old one.	Joale hape, eo e ne e le 'na oa khale.
I don't know what to think.	Ha ke tsebe seo nka se nahanang.
We both get there at the same time.	Ka bobeli re fihla moo ka nako e le 'ngoe.
He was the one who had to know things.	E ne e le eena ea neng a lokela ho tseba lintho.
I just love it.	Ke e rata feela.
I'm not sure what it is and then you look at someone.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore na ke eng mme ebe o shebella motho.
I can't speak.	Ha ke khone ho bua.
Those things were very clear.	Lintho tseo li ne li hlakile haholo.
Or do any work.	Kapa u etse mosebetsi ofe kapa ofe.
Living with us.	Ho phela le rona.
Yes, just a few things.	E, lintho tse seng kae feela.
It will be so.	Ho tla ba joalo.
To be continued.	Ho tsoela pele.
All of this made me think.	Taba ena kaofela e ile ea etsa hore ke nahane.
Do not be one of them.	U se ke ua ba e mong oa bona.
That everything was better than ever.	Hore ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e le ntle ho feta.
What it could do, it had done.	Seo e neng e ka se etsa, e ne e se entse.
You can drink those things if necessary.	U ka noa lintho tseo haeba ho hlokahala.
I was not good at this.	Ke ne ke se hantle ho sena.
I didn't see him come out much.	Ha kea ka ka mo bona a tsoa haholo.
They must have found something, but they refused to tell me what to do.	E tlameha ebe ba fumane ho hong, empa ba hana ho mpolella eng.
This was a real situation for me.	Bona e ne e le boemo ba sebele ho ’na.
He will come in time.	O tla tla ka nako.
The room next to me came back.	Kamore e haufi le 'na e ile ea khutla.
Nothing else worked.	Ha ho letho le leng le ileng la sebetsa.
And we are.	'Me re joalo.
The opinion is mine.	Maikutlo ke a ka.
He did what anyone else could do.	O entse seo motho ofe kapa ofe a neng a ka se etsa.
He did not think it was possible.	O ne a sa nahane hore ho ka etsahala.
I thought it was weird.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke ntho e makatsang.
It is a powerful emotion.	Ke maikutlo a matla.
Yet nothing.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho letho.
He loved her very much.	O ne a mo rata haholo.
The atmosphere was pleasant.	Boemo bo ne bo le monate.
You will need him now more than ever.	U tla mo hloka hona joale ho feta leha e le neng pele.
I need to talk to him now.	Ke hloka ho bua le eena hona joale.
It's really weird.	Ke ntho e makatsang ruri.
He left.	O ile a tloha.
The news is not good.	Litaba ha li monate.
I think it comes with that place.	Ke nahana hore e tla le sebaka seo.
Just to help.	Ho thusa feela.
Like this house.	Joalo ka ntlo ena.
Now imagine that that really happened.	Joale nahana hore seo se hlile se etsahala.
He did not want to offend her.	O ne a sa batle ho mo rata.
Perhaps he would.	Mohlomong o ne a tla etsa joalo.
I should enjoy the stay.	Ke lokela ho thabela ho lula.
But it will live.	Empa e tla phela.
Long buy time.	Nako e telele ea ho reka nako.
People should watch it.	Batho ba lokela ho e shebella.
It's hard.	E thata.
The opportunity was too good for me to give up.	Monyetla o ne o le motle haholo hore nka o tlohela.
I visited him from time to time.	Ke ne ke mo etela ka linako tse ling.
This is very important.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo.
We are happy to take care of those things.	Re thabela ho hlokomela lintho tseo.
Also, it is not very good.	Hape, ha e ntle haholo.
It's my business to know.	Ke taba ea ka ho tseba.
I do not know, it is very new.	Ha ke tsebe, e ncha haholo.
It will last for many years.	E tla ba teng ka lilemo tse ngata.
More often than not, it is.	Hangata ho feta moo, ho joalo.
A little.	Hanyane.
So sometimes it is better to give it away first.	Kahoo ka linako tse ling ho molemo ho fana ka eona pele.
They love their children.	Ba rata bana ba bona.
I have nothing.	Ha ke na letho.
Good coffee here.	Kofi e ntle mona.
It just came out recently.	E sa tsoa tsoa haufinyane.
Lots of room.	Kamore e ngata.
Like a book.	Joalo ka buka.
Several years.	Lilemo tse 'maloa.
He just came back.	A qeta ho khutla.
Please consider giving such an important reason.	Ka kopo, nahana ka ho fana ka lebaka la bohlokoa joalo.
Pay with money.	Lefa ka chelete.
I found that the whole thing was not enough.	Ke fumane ntho eo kaofela e sa lekana.
They work, but they can be much better.	Li sebetsa, empa li ka ba betere haholo.
He can do nothing.	A ke ke a etsa letho.
I still had work to do.	Ke ne ke ntse ke e-na le mosebetsi oo ke lokelang ho o etsa.
She felt so beautiful, so sweet.	O ne a ikutloa a le motle haholo, a le monate haholo.
I like being in my place.	Ke rata ho ba sebakeng sa ka.
I wanted to see it again.	Ke ne ke batla ho bona hape.
We refuse to do so today.	Re hana ho etsa joalo kajeno.
However, that was not his case.	Leha ho le joalo, eo e ne e se taba ea hae.
Obviously, he too was tired.	Ho hlakile hore le eena o ne a khathetse.
But his head was very sore.	Empa hlooho ya hae e ne e le bohloko haholo.
Well easy for me.	Hantle bonolo ho 'na.
I still do not understand them.	Ke ntse ke sa li utloisise.
Life is Beautiful.	Bophelo bo monate.
He was three at the time.	O ne a le tharo ka nako eo.
He is no more.	Ha a sa le eo.
You do not know what you did.	Ha o tsebe seo o se entseng.
Some headaches are more painful than others.	Tse ling tsa hlooho li bohloko ho feta tse ling.
I will call her.	Ke tla mo letsetsa.
Painless.	E se nang bohloko.
See you next week !.	Ke tla le bona bekeng e tlang!.
Just give what we have.	Fana feela seo re nang le sona.
I need to sleep.	Ke hloka ho robala.
It would be better to pay you.	Ho ka ba molemo ho u lefa.
One I probably would have known more about that.	E mong mohlomong ke ne ke tla tseba ho feta ka seo.
We need him, too.	Re a mo hloka, le rona.
They provide very tasty food.	Ba fana ka lijo tse monate haholo.
To hold it.	Ho e tšoara.
And get into it.	Le ho kena ho eona.
This is not necessarily true.	Sena ha se hakaalo hore ke 'nete.
I had a very interesting thing that happened.	Ke bile le ntho e monate haholo e etsahetseng.
Just take it and go.	E nke feela 'me u tsamaee.
Breakfast is waiting.	Lijo tsa hoseng li emetse.
We are looking for people who will work here.	Re batla batho ba tla sebetsa mona.
It can be fun to try.	Ho ka ba monate ho leka.
Then ask for feedback.	Ebe u botsa ka maikutlo.
The last thing he needed was that.	Ntho ea ho qetela eo a neng a e hloka ke hore.
Or it will be when they finish it.	Kapa e tla ba ha ba e qeta.
That's all it is.	Ke seo e leng sona feela.
Then it just had to stop.	Joale ho ne ho lokela ho ema feela.
If they are not, they are not.	Haeba ha ba joalo, ha ho joalo.
So he had to stop.	Kahoo o ile a tlameha ho ema.
But somehow they don't.	Empa ka tsela e ’ngoe ha ba etse joalo.
I know a lot of weird people.	Ke tseba batho ba bangata ba makatsang.
Everything was clear.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e hlakile.
He went into his house.	A kena ha hae.
Eventually you have to refuse.	Qetellong u tlameha ho hana.
Nice to come back !.	Ho monate ho khutla!.
It is better to make sure that help comes.	Ho molemo ho etsa bonnete ba hore thuso ea tla.
We were moving forward.	Re ne re ea pele.
It finally arrived.	Qetellong ea fihla.
I hope they will leave soon.	Ke tšepa ba tla tsamaea kapele.
He finished it.	O ile a e qeta.
I did not want to do this.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho etsa sena.
We can't go after it.	Re ke ke ra ea ka morao ho eona.
It was very clear that this was it.	Ho ne ho hlakile haholo hore sena ke sona.
But tomorrow he will be there.	Empa hosane o tla be a le teng.
Now you have a problem.	Joale u na le bothata.
I do not know more than you know.	Ha ke tsebe ho feta kamoo o tsebang ka hona.
She was happy to be back.	O ne a thabetse ho khutla.
It was really important to get that.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le bohlokoa ho fumana seo.
Keep trying new things.	Tsoela pele ho leka lintho tse ncha.
You need to see how they talk about you.	U lokela ho bona tsela eo ba buang ka uena ka eona.
It didn't know.	E ne e sa tsebe.
She would be fine.	O ne a tla phela hantle.
I did not read.	Ke ne ke sa bala.
No one knows what to do.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na a etse eng.
I like to keep things simple.	Ke rata ho boloka lintho li le bonolo.
Children have it.	Bana ba na le eona.
But that he was still here.	Empa hore o ne a ntse a le teng mona.
This is important to me, baby.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa ho 'na, ngoana.
But tell us about him.	Empa re bolelle ka eena.
I see it by looking at them.	Ke bona ka ho ba sheba.
It was great to see you again.	Ho bile monate ho u bona hape.
They are somewhat heavy, but not many.	Li batla li le boima, empa ha li ngata.
You enter.	Ua kena.
It starts well and goes well.	E qala hantle 'me e tsamaea hantle.
In fact, he did.	Ha e le hantle o ile a etsa joalo.
Finally, it was time to go to bed.	Qetellong e ile ea fihla nako ea hore ke e’o robala.
Driving a car can be dangerous.	Ho khanna koloi ho ka ba kotsi.
If you do not know this, you are already too late.	Haeba u sa tsebe sena, u se u le morao haholo.
And yet they did.	Mme leha ho le jwalo ba ile ba etsa jwalo.
They would meet again that night.	Ba ne ba tla kopana hape bosiung boo.
More than his father would be a difficult task.	Ho feta ntate oa hae e ne e tla ba mosebetsi o boima.
It would not be painful to look at my house.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba bohloko ho sheba ntlo ea ka.
We would have to find a way to get through.	Re ne re tla tlameha ho fumana tsela ea ho feta.
Because of his meekness, no one will help him.	Ka lebaka la bonolo ba hae, ha ho motho ea tla mo thusa.
But it does not matter.	Empa ha ho na taba.
He is one of us.	Ke e mong wa rona.
A lot of things are happening.	Ho na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang.
It really works, too.	Ehlile ea sebetsa, hape.
And it will never be the same again.	Mme ha ho sa tla hlola ho eba jwalo.
It was an emotion.	E bile maikutlo.
But only one.	Empa e le 'ngoe feela.
He loved where he was now.	O ne a rata moo a leng teng hona joale.
He knows what you need and will provide.	O tseba seo u se hlokang ’me o tla fana ka sona.
Some ideas were even worse.	Maikutlo a mang a ne a le mpe le ho feta.
I think I go first.	Ke nahana hore ke ea pele.
I really like that.	Ke rata seo haholo.
The more you drive, the more money you save.	Ha u khanna haholo, u boloka chelete e ngata.
We would not need that.	Re ka be re sa hloke tseo.
You have to go there with him.	U tlameha ho ea moo le eena.
But it's fun to watch.	Empa ho monate ho shebella.
The children wanted to talk to their teacher.	Bana ba ne ba lakatsa ho bua le tichere ea bona.
People work on that.	Batho ba sebetsa ho seo.
Nice to see you.	Ke thabela ho o bona.
Just.	Feela.
And it was good.	Mme ho ne ho le molemo.
If he had to go home on foot, he would come.	Haeba a ne a ka tlameha ho ea hae ka maoto, o ne a tla.
Get help.	Fumana thuso.
I thought you might like it.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o ka e rata.
He did not know if this thing would work.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ntho ena e tla sebetsa.
I'll see you next week.	Ke tla u bona bekeng e tlang.
Write what you want.	Ngola seo u se batlang.
He looked at his shoes.	A sheba lieta tsa hae.
This is what he wants.	Sena ke seo a se batlang.
I really need it.	Ke hloka haholo.
The parents were delighted.	Batsoali ba ne ba thabile.
And it can be.	Mme ho ka ba jwalo.
I must have caught one.	E tlameha ebe ke ile ka tšoara e le 'ngoe.
I don’t know what he does with his money.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o etsang ka chelete ea hae.
You do not say the same thing about your party.	Ha o bue joalo ka mokete oa hau.
Keep it that way.	Tsoela pele joalo.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
He needed to know more.	O ne a lokela ho tseba ho feta.
However it was not difficult to start with that.	Leha ho le joalo ho ne ho se thata ho qala ka taba eo.
There was something.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho e itseng .
I knew that girl.	Ke ne ke tseba ngoanana eo.
Things just work and work just fine.	Lintho li sebetsa feela 'me li sebetsa hantle feela.
It's nothing.	Ha se letho.
Her father is important.	Ntate oa hae o bohlokoa.
It is better to buy your time.	Ho molemo ho reka nako ea hau.
Assume it to be so.	Nka hore ho joalo.
He was not a big man.	E ne e se monna e moholo.
He had it all, but it was still not enough.	O ne a e-na le eona kaofela, empa e ne e ntse e sa lekana.
It is easy to understand why.	Ho bonolo ho utloisisa lebaka.
There has to be some way to do it.	Ho tlameha ho be le mokhoa o itseng oa ho e etsa.
He was very happy.	O ne a thabile haholo.
Also, they probably were there.	Hape, mohlomong ba ne ba le teng.
Really good mind.	Kelello e ntle ruri.
But that is not our job.	Empa oo hase mosebetsi oa rona.
Is that so? 	Na ho joalo?
It is often difficult to say what he thinks.	Hangata ho thata ho bolela seo a se nahanang.
Why this is a stupid idea.	Hobaneng sena e le mohopolo o hlokang kelello.
He rides well.	O palama hantle.
There seemed to be no hard feelings.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na maikutlo a thata.
He enjoyed the work.	O ile a thabela mosebetsi oo.
I am an individual.	Ke motho ka mong.
He thought the pain would pass.	O ne a nahana hore bohloko bo tla feta.
That's what will help him get over it.	Ke eona ntho e tla mo thusa ho e feta.
That's it.	Ke eona.
Your operating room.	Kamore ea hau ea ho sebetsa.
Obviously, the boy did not want to leave.	Ho hlakile hore moshanyana eo o ne a sa batle ho tsamaea.
Thank you, he fixed everything.	Kea leboha, o ile a lokisa tsohle.
I feel strong.	Ke utloa matla.
That is where we are today.	Ke moo re leng teng kajeno.
No, that was very powerful.	Che, hoo ho ne ho le matla haholo.
But the boy has something to do with me.	Empa moshanyana o na le taba le nna.
But see.	Empa bona.
And of course, there are many more.	'Me ha e le hantle, ho na le tse ling tse ngata.
Everyone who knew her loved her.	Bohle ba neng ba mo tseba ba ne ba mo rata.
There was nothing that he or any of the others could do.	Ho ne ho se seo eena kapa leha e le ofe oa ba bang a ka se etsang.
Let's see how long that takes.	A re bone hore na seo se nka nako e kae.
Imagine where he could have been at that time.	Nahana hore na a ka be a ne a le hokae ka nako eo.
What he did not need were problems.	Seo a neng a sa se hloke e ne e le mathata.
He knew exactly what he was doing.	O ne a tseba hantle seo a se etsang.
There would be no meaning.	Ho ne ho se na ho bolela.
We left about a week early.	Re ile ra tsamaea hoo e ka bang beke pele ho nako.
But one does not have to stay that long.	Empa ha ho hlokahale hore motho a lule ho seo nako e telele.
They have been our friends for the rest of our lives.	E ntse e le metsoalle ea rōna bophelo bohle ba rōna.
However, he knew he had to do it.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a tseba hore o tlameha ho e etsa.
I just mean that no one would notice or care.	Ke bolela feela hore ha ho motho ea neng a tla hlokomela kapa a tsotelle.
He has the best time ever to be here.	O na le nako e ntle ka ho fetisisa e kileng ea e-ba mona.
He feels tired.	A ikutloa a khathetse.
I wouldn’t use them, though.	Ke ne nke ke ka li sebelisa, leha ho le joalo.
Group.	Sehlopha.
Always, always, always.	Kamehla, kamehla, kamehla.
Not too long ago.	Ha se khale haholo.
If not more.	Haeba e se ho feta.
But he can no longer do that.	Empa ha a sa khona ho etsa joalo.
But it is difficult.	Empa ho thata.
He will not go.	A ke ke a tsamaea.
It could be years.	E ka ba lilemo.
I have no problem with it.	Ha ke na bothata ka eona.
And of course, you are not.	'Me ha e le hantle, ha u joalo.
This is not a pleasant situation.	Sena ha se boemo bo monate.
People learned to do that, and they did.	Batho ba ile ba ithuta ho etsa seo, mme ba etsa seo.
You wanted to move on.	U ne u batla ho ea pele.
The coffee here is delicious.	Kofi mona e monate.
But it is.	Empa ho jwalo.
They can be anywhere and do the same thing.	Ba ka ba kae kapa kae 'me ba etsa ntho e tšoanang.
We left in the morning.	Ra tloha hoseng.
But there is nothing you can say.	Empa ha ho letho leo u ka le buang.
I knew what this was all about.	Ke ne ke tseba hore na sena ke eng.
No, that's not the case here.	Che, ha se taba eo mona.
Going forward.	Ho ya pele.
They want you to be better than you are.	Ba batla hore o be betere ho feta kamoo o leng kateng.
It is one of them.	Ke monyetla o le mong oa bona.
They wanted him to do something.	Ba ne ba batla hore a etse ho hong.
In and out.	Ho kena le ho tsoa.
No one knew where.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tseba moo.
He helped her to her feet.	A mo thusa ho ema ka maoto.
But he had things to do.	Empa o ne a e-na le lintho tseo a lokelang ho li etsa.
They both cried as they boarded the car.	Ka bobeli ba ile ba lla ha ba ntse ba palama koloi.
All he was saying was this.	Sohle seo a neng a se bua ke sena.
It will take several hours.	Ho tla nka lihora tse 'maloa.
It was weird to be honest.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang ho bua 'nete.
Think of a group of people who have the power to make money.	Nahana ka sehlopha sa batho ba nang le matla a ho etsa chelete.
But it's fun to think.	Empa ho monate ho nahana.
I will do anything for you.	Ke tla u etsetsa eng kapa eng.
We should not drink too much.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho noa haholo.
I think you are one.	Ke nahana hore o mong.
Obviously this is important.	Ho hlakile hore sena ke sa bohlokoa.
He continued to be there for me.	O ile a tsoela pele ho ba teng bakeng sa ka.
The police will look into it.	Mapolesa a tla e sheba.
There was a kind of.	Ho ne ho e-na le mofuta oa.
It did him no good.	Ha ea mo thusa letho.
Just like we can't find someone we can love.	Joalo ka ha re ke ke ra fumana motho eo re ka mo ratang.
It was weird, really.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang, ka 'nete.
But perhaps this is still the case.	Empa mohlomong sena se ntse se le joalo.
The party went on until late at night.	Mokete o ile oa kena ho fihlela bosiu.
Other than that it seems to work well.	Ntle le moo e bonahala e sebetsa hantle.
I see a person.	Ke bona motho.
The truth is the issue now.	'Nete ke taba hona joale.
I had heard that name before.	Ke ne ke utloile lebitso leo pele.
There was none.	Ho ne ho se na.
Obviously that was easier said than done.	Ho hlakile hore seo se ne se le bonolo ho feta ho se etsa.
Fun learning.	Ho ithuta ka monate.
I had to come back a lot.	Ke ne ke lokela ho khutla haholo.
I will not say.	Nke ke ka bolela.
It's us now.	Ke rona hona joale.
It's one thing or another.	Ke ntho e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe.
Maybe they did, but saying so does not make it so.	Mohlomong ba entse joalo, empa ho bua joalo ha ho etse hore ho be joalo.
I'm just telling you something.	Ke mpa ke o bolella ho hong.
The child was eating when the letter arrived.	Ngoana o ne a ntse a ja ha lengolo le fihla.
He has more than many.	O na le tse ngata ho feta tse ngata.
Our baby will be fine.	Ngoana oa rona o tla phela hantle.
In the morning.	Hoseng.
Maybe it doesn't matter.	Mohlomong ha ho na taba.
This is just for us.	Sena ke sa rona feela.
He left in the morning, as always.	O ile a tloha hoseng, joalo ka kamehla.
People want to learn.	Batho ba batla ho ithuta.
I know exactly what you are in.	Ke tseba hantle seo o leng ho sona.
Only one child.	Ke ngoana a le mong feela.
That was my decision.	Eo e bile qeto ea ka.
So read one.	Kahoo bala e le 'ngoe.
asked the teacher.	ha botsa tichere.
That will never happen again.	Seo ha se sa tla etsahala.
Maybe it should have been.	Mohlomong e ne e lokela ho ba joalo.
I know you can see them too.	Kea tseba hore le uena u ka li bona.
Only they will make you one.	Feela ba tla u etsa e mong.
My mother said nothing.	'Mè ha aa ka a bua letho.
He still had to understand the matter.	O ne a ntse a tlameha ho utloisisa taba eo.
It was a wonderful party.	E bile mokete o monate haholo.
That's right.	Ke 'nete eo.
I know how it is.	Kea tseba hore na ho joang.
You loved him, of course.	O ne o mo rata, ehlile.
That is why he needed so many people.	Ke kahoo o neng o hloka batho ba bangata hakana.
You just want to get out.	U batla ho tsoa feela.
It's up to me.	E ho nna.
We often do not know.	Hangata ha re tsebe.
Now he had three.	Joale o ne a e-na le tse tharo.
Walking without it can be dangerous.	Ho tsamaea ntle le eona ho ka ba kotsi.
And that was all we needed.	Mme seo e ne e le sohle se re neng re se hloka.
If there is a possibility, go that way.	Haeba ho na le e ka khonang, tsamaea ka tsela eo.
It can't be nothing.	E ka se be letho.
Think of what you have done!	Nahana ka seo u se entseng!
This is not an easy task.	Ona ha se mosebetsi o bonolo.
So this helps.	Kahoo sena se thusa.
We conclude that this is not the case.	Re etsa qeto ea hore ha ho joalo.
You will talk about it.	U tla bua ka eona.
I do not know how to fix the mistake.	Ha ke tsebe ho lokisa phoso.
I'd like to stay.	Ke kopa ho lula .
I didn't have many things.	Ke ne ke sena lintho tse ngata.
It goes on and on.	E ntse e tsoela pele.
It is not necessary at all.	Ho hang ha ho hlokahale.
I will learn.	Ke tla ithuta.
I liked to be simple with my clothes.	Ke ne ke rata ho ba bonolo ka liaparo tsa ka.
It is very difficult to talk about it.	Ho thata haholo ho bua ka taba eo.
I hope you enjoy the book.	Ke tšepa hore u tla thabela buka.
But at the end of the day you have a family again.	Empa qetellong ea letsatsi u na le lelapa hape.
So you have this pain.	Kahoo u na le bohloko bona.
How will you benefit from them?	U tla fumana molemo ofe bakeng sa bona?
Very nice place.	Sebaka se setle haholo.
From a car person, that is.	Ho tloha ho motho oa koloi, ke hore.
It's still very hard but it goes to work.	E ntse e le thata haholo empa e ea sebetsa.
Of course, do not try to get there at all.	Ka 'nete, u se ke ua leka ho fihla moo ho hang.
We were at his house.	Re ne re le ha hae.
However this method does not seem to work.	Leha ho le joalo mokhoa ona ha o bonahale o sebetsa.
Che, che, che, che.	Che, che, che, che.
They already have too much.	Ba se ba ntse ba e-na le e ngata haholo.
It's not that easy.	Ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
One.	Ea mong.
His first book.	Buka ea hae ea pele.
It hurts so much to think about it all.	Ho bohloko haholo ho nahana ka eona kaofela.
Watching it, playing it.	Ho e shebella, ho e bapala.
None of them spoke.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ileng a bua.
We were just human.	Re ne re le batho feela.
I think about those years.	Ke nahana ka lilemo tseo.
It really was that way.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le joalo.
Watching him all the time.	Ho mo shebella ka linako tsohle.
Which route would you take? 	U ne u tla ea ka tsela efe?
It was a difficult time for both of us.	E ne e le nako e thata ho rona ka bobeli.
But we do not think so.	Empa ha re nahane joalo.
But there is a fact.	Empa ho na le 'nete e itseng.
So yes, it was just fine.	Kahoo ee, e ne e le hantle feela.
We didn't talk much about him at the time.	Re ne re sa bue hakaalo ka eena ka nako eo.
So maybe this is another one.	Kahoo mohlomong ena ke e 'ngoe.
But that is not what is happening here.	Empa ha se se etsahalang mona.
I will make her think you are my wife.	Ke tla etsa hore a nahane hore u mosali oa ka.
Before that happens, you have or do not have things.	Pele seo se etsahala, u na le lintho kapa ha u na lintho.
However, it would not be dangerous to try.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba le kotsi ho leka.
I'll sleep here tonight.	Ke tla robala mona bosiu.
There is nothing about them anywhere.	Ha ho letho ka bona kae kapa kae.
But those behind us are still there.	Empa ba ka mora rona ba ntse ba le teng.
Just be careful.	Hlokomela feela.
So far well.	Ho fihlela joale hantle.
We need your help.	Re kopa thuso ea hau.
He can't have none of that.	A ke ke a ba le letho la seo.
Do one.	Etsa e le 'ngoe.
Nobody seems to know what's going on.	Ho bonahala ho se motho ya tsebang se etsahalang.
It can be anything you want.	E ka ba eng kapa eng eo u e batlang.
So he knew how to do it.	Kahoo o ne a tseba ho e etsa.
Still, I was happy.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke thabile.
It's up to the individual to.	Ho ho motho ka mong ho.
Of course, we have had some rocky times.	Ke 'nete hore re bile le linako tse thata.
I just give you a head start.	Ke u fa hlooho feela.
It was too fast.	E bile kapele haholo.
They went out and found a great player.	Ba ile ba tsoa 'me ba fumana sebapali se hloahloa.
He was still fixing his debt to her.	O ne a ntse a lokisa molato oa hae ho eena.
It's a really good job.	Ke mosebetsi o motle ruri.
He could do what he had to do.	O ne a ka etsa seo a neng a tlameha ho se etsa.
It was not long before he was arrested.	Ha hoa ka ha nka nako e telele pele a tšoaroa.
This is your fault.	Ena ke phoso ea hau.
I can't even tell you how it started.	Ha ke khone le ho u bolella hore na e qala joang.
It’s a writing style that he does well.	Ke mokhoa oa ho ngola oo a o etsang hantle.
You are alone.	U le mong.
So we went looking for them.	Kahoo re ile ra ea li batla.
But perhaps that is not the case.	Empa mohlomong ha ho joalo.
Just know that it will benefit you.	Tseba feela hore ho tla u tsoela molemo.
You would not believe it.	U ne u ke ke ua lumela.
They are not at all fun.	Ho hang ha li monate.
They don't care if you're a man.	Ha ba tsotelle hore na o monna.
Finally the day came.	Qetellong letsatsi le ile la fihla.
His wife could not pay.	Mosali oa hae o ne a sitoa ho lefa.
At times it seemed that time would not come.	Ka linako tse ling ho ne ho bonahala eka nako e ke ke ea fihla.
That's not what it does.	Ha se seo e se etsang.
She works much better.	O sebetsa betere haholo.
If you can try it, you should try it.	Haeba u ka e leka, u lokela ho e leka.
Maybe he would have died, maybe not.	Mohlomong o ne a tla hlokahala, mohlomong ho se joalo.
Unless, of course, he already knew about it.	Ntle le haeba, ho hlakile, o ne a se a ntse a tseba ka eona.
We all have to save water.	Kaofela re tlameha ho boloka metsi.
Then it begins to reunite.	Ebe e qala ho kopana hape.
By simply saying his name.	Ka ho bolela lebitso la hae feela.
Instead, he knew that he needed to speak.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ne a tseba hore o lokela ho bua.
But it is.	Empa ho joalo.
Too much space, or not enough.	Sebaka se ngata haholo, kapa ha sea lekana.
It was not news to him.	E ne e se litaba ho eena.
For some people, though.	Ho batho ba bang, leha ho le joalo.
Or just me.	Kapa ke 'na feela.
There is no need to do that.	Ha ho hlokahale ho etsa joalo.
Or something else, something simpler.	Kapa ntho e 'ngoe, ntho e bonolo haholoanyane.
But the same thing happens.	Empa taba e tšoanang ea etsahala.
Of course you can get more than that.	Ha e le hantle u ka fumana ho feta moo.
And we started talking.	Mme ra qala ho bua.
He said he was useless.	O ile a re ha a na thuso.
People are happy here.	Batho ba thabile mona.
That has always been important to me.	Seo esale e le sa bohlokoa ho 'na.
They asked many questions.	Ba ne ba botsa lipotso tse ngata.
The first from him.	Ea pele ho tsoa ho eena.
You can learn a lot from children.	U ka ithuta lintho tse ngata ho bana.
Thanks for the thought, it could be.	Kea leboha ka mohopolo, ho ka ba joalo.
I just want you to know.	Ke batla feela hore o tsebe.
And the team you will play with.	Le sehlopha seo o tlo bapala le sona.
I start again.	Ke qala hape.
And here it is.	Mme ke sena.
I know what's good now.	Ke tseba se setle jwale.
Family to many.	Lelapa ho ba bangata.
My father did nothing wrong.	Ntate ha aa etsa letho le phoso.
He did not even try to sleep.	Ha a ka a leka le ho robala.
It was him.	E ne e le eena.
He got another idea.	A fumana mohopolo o mong.
I need to see something.	Ke hloka ho bona ho hong.
This seems to be the case.	Sena se bonahala se le joalo.
I want to love someone.	Ke batla ho rata motho.
She thanked him for the delicious food.	O ile a mo leboha ka lijo tse monate.
It was a beautiful picture.	E ne e le setšoantšo se setle.
But, there seems to be a problem.	Empa, ho bonahala ho na le bothata.
You still have to know how to write well, yes.	U ntse u tlameha ho tseba ho ngola hantle, e.
There are three of them.	Ho na le tse tharo tsa tsona.
Plus, you can do better.	Ho feta moo, o ka etsa hantle ho feta.
We hugged hard.	Re ile ra hakana ka thata.
It seems we can overcome it.	Ho bonahala eka re ka e hlola.
Your important person will leave you.	Motho oa hau oa bohlokoa o tla u tlohela.
These people are in a very difficult situation.	Batho bana ba sebakeng se thata haholo.
I knew this was supposed to be theirs.	Ke ne ke tseba hore sena e ne e lokela ho ba bona.
It's too bad.	Hape e mpe.
I hope that thing will happen soon.	Kea tšepa hore ntho eo e tla etsahala haufinyane.
I surpass him.	Kea mo feta.
It helps a lot !.	E thusa haholo!.
If I see something it means it is going to work.	Haeba ke bona ntho e itseng ho bolela hore e ea sebetsa.
He certainly has an idea of ​​what people like.	Ka sebele o na le maikutlo a seo batho ba se ratang.
So money is important to them.	Kahoo chelete ke ea bohlokoa ho bona.
I have the opportunity to get things done on time.	Ke na le monyetla oa ho etsa lintho ka nako.
Maybe they can say we did a good job.	Mohlomong ba ka re re entse mosebetsi o motle.
Her friends often talk about her.	Hangata metsoalle ea hae e bua ka eena.
It still works on it.	E ntse e sebetsa ho eona.
And that would not be right.	Mme hoo e ka se be hantle.
This is very good.	Ena e ntle haholo.
Well, a few of them.	Hantle, tse seng kae tsa tsona.
And this, my friends, is what you want.	'Me sena, metsoalle ea ka, ke seo le se batlang.
I was hurt when I saw his pain.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko ha ke bona bohloko ba hae.
When you are alone, you can probably do very well.	Ha u le mong, mohlomong u ka sebetsa hantle haholo.
However, I do not want to sleep next to him.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke batle ho robala haufi le eena.
She loved her hair.	O ne a rata moriri oa hae.
He may not be caught in the first group.	A ka 'na a se ke a tšoaroa sehlopheng sa pele.
I did not have to go out and do what they did.	Ke ne ke sa tlameha ho tsamaea ho ea etsa seo ba se entseng.
I was not expecting anything.	Ke ne ke sa lebella letho.
Only my father.	Ntate feela.
You will have to ask for it.	O tla tlameha ho e kopa.
I will help you find a psychologist you can talk to.	Ke tla u thusa ho fumana setsebi sa kelello seo u ka buang le sona.
He worked long hours.	O ne a sebetsa lihora tse telele haholo.
So they go there, and look.	Kahoo ba ea moo, 'me ba sheba.
I'm not sure what it will mean.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na e tla bolela eng.
A little over a year ago.	Hanyane selemong se fetileng.
It was a very strange thing.	E ne e le taba e makatsang haholo.
He was tired from work.	O ne a khathetse ke mosebetsi.
Everyone wants this situation.	E mong le e mong o batla boemo bona.
Don't care.	Se re tsotelle.
And maybe we can reach them.	Mme mohlomong re ka ba fihlela.
She had just taken care of the man.	O ne a sa tsoa hlokomela monna eo.
They arrived home exhausted.	Ba ile ba fihla hae ba khathetse.
You are the first one here.	Ke uena oa pele mona.
He loves the people.	O rata batho.
For this, you can do several things.	Bakeng sa sena, o ka etsa lintho tse 'maloa.
My husband works.	Monna oa ka oa sebetsa.
I'm fine.	Ke phela hantle.
Time travel.	Ho tsamaea ka nako.
I have never seen anyone cry so much.	Ha ke eso bone motho a lla hakana.
But he was not.	Empa o ne a se joalo.
He said it would help.	O itse e ka thusa.
Yet it was true.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e le 'nete.
I love this job.	Ke rata mosebetsi ona.
I will give it to you.	Ke tla fana ka eona.
However, what she did not have was her husband.	Leha ho le joalo, seo a neng a se na sona e ne e le monna oa hae.
It should be something like this.	E lokela ho ba ntho e kang ena.
I even wrote about him.	Ke bile ke ngola ka eena.
Look at everything and do not be afraid to ask questions.	Sheba ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe 'me u se ke ua tšaba ho botsa lipotso.
Too much money, of course.	Chelete e ngata haholo, ha e le hantle.
However, she could not state her cause.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sitoa ho bolela bothata ba hae.
There is no reason to doubt that that is true.	Ha ho na lebaka la ho belaela hore seo ke ’nete.
He is coming for me.	O tla bakeng sa ka.
It's been too long.	E se e le nako e telele haholo.
There must be a problem.	Ho tlameha ho ba le bothata.
Look at all his work.	Sheba mosebetsi oa hae kaofela.
I could no longer do it.	Ke ne ke se ke sa khone ho e etsa.
This has always been a problem.	Sena esale e le bothata.
It's such a tough team.	Ke sehlopha se thata hakana.
But he refuses to talk to me about it.	Empa o hana ho bua le ’na ka taba eo.
This book is outdated.	Buka ena ke ea khale.
Important things were happening.	Ho ne ho ntse ho etsahala lintho tsa bohlokoa.
It was the same with my hair.	Ho ne ho le joalo le ka moriri oa ka.
He had plenty of time.	O ne a ena le nako e ngata.
I think that's a good thing.	Ke nahana hore ke ntho e ntle.
That is what all parents want.	Ke seo batsoali bohle ba se batlang.
We will not give you money.	Ha re na ho u fa chelete.
Maybe they wanted that.	Mohlomong ba ne ba batla seo.
She is tough.	O thata.
I thought about this.	Ke ile ka nahana ka sena.
Please don't say anything to her.	Ke kopa o se ke oa bua letho ho eena.
We think this is true.	Re nahana hore sena ke 'nete hantle.
It is something we know how to do.	Ke ntho eo re tsebang ho e etsa.
I hope yours will be much better.	Ke tšepa hore ea hau e tla ba betere haholo.
But it was too late.	Empa e ne e se e le morao haholo.
We are glad how it happened.	Re thabetse kamoo ho etsahetseng kateng.
I said nothing.	Ke ne ke sa bue letho.
But he probably did.	Empa mohlomong o ile a etsa joalo.
But he hears someone coming.	Empa o utloa e mong a tla.
There is no reason why we should not be parents.	Ha ho na lebaka leo ka lona re sa lokelang ho ba batsoali.
But he probably did not need both.	Empa mohlomong o ne a sa li hloke ka bobeli.
Everyone knew.	Bohle ba ne ba tseba.
It was hard work, and someone had to take it.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima, 'me motho e mong o ile a tlameha ho o nka.
Talk about bad news.	Bua ka litaba tse mpe.
So far it works.	Ho fihlela joale e ntse e sebetsa.
People will start walking soon.	Batho ba tla qala ho tsamaea haufinyane.
There was no way he could say that.	Haho kamoo a neng a ka bolela seo.
People could not do their work.	Batho ba ne ba sitoa ho etsa mosebetsi oa bona.
He really needed to use my name.	O ne a hlile a hloka ho sebelisa lebitso la ka.
Let's meet again.	Re kopane hape.
He slept in the back here several times.	O ile a robala ka morao mona ka makhetlo a 'maloa.
It is so important.	Ho bohlokoa hakaalo.
You have to find them.	U tlameha ho li fumana.
I looked back quickly.	Ke ile ka sheba morao kapele.
Only the first.	Ea pele feela.
Of this situation !? 	Ea boemo bona!?
than to be.	ho feta ho ba.
Amazing life.	Bophelo bo makatsang.
I really like them.	Ke li rata haholo.
You are not easy.	Ha o bonolo.
Nothing is more important than that.	Ha ho letho le bohlokoa ho feta moo.
Life was no longer easy.	Bophelo bo ne bo se bo se bonolo.
It is very dangerous now.	Ho kotsi haholo ha jwale.
What are you doing today?	U etsang kajeno?
But many of them go back.	Empa ba bangata ba bona ba khutlela morao.
He never did.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo.
I will not let you go.	Nke ke ka o tlohela.
He had to come.	O ne a lokela ho tla.
I was not talking to you.	Ke ne ke sa bue le wena.
I did not stay long after he left.	Ha kea ka ka lula nako e telele ka mor'a hore a tsamaee.
But again, we're not here to take anything from anyone.	Empa hape, ha re mona ho nka letho ho mang kapa mang.
I think people understand it then.	Ke nahana hore batho ba e utloisisa ka nako eo.
They looked so beautiful.	Li ile tsa bonahala li le ntle haholo.
We learn so that we can learn.	Rea ithuta e le hore re ka ithuta.
Old, old.	Khale, khale.
But we can't try to get out.	Empa re ke ke ra leka ho tsoa.
I hope they will always be there.	Ke tšepa ba tla lula ba le teng.
We would love to have some of them.	Re ka thabela ho ba le tse ling tsa tsona.
I'm checking out.	Kea tsoa.
Again, this is true.	Hape, sena ke 'nete.
You have to get a regular job.	U tlameha ho fumana mosebetsi oa kamehla.
It would be great.	E ne e tla ba e ntle.
Certainly not!	Ka sebele ha ho joalo!
It was my first mistake.	E bile phoso ea ka ea pele.
I just stood there.	Ke ile ka ema moo feela.
Only when we were very close.	Feela ha re ne re le haufi haholo.
It was just a place to stand.	E ne e le sebaka sa ho ema feela.
Great man.	Motho e moholo.
He can do whatever he wants.	A ka etsa eng kapa eng eo a e batlang.
This is a good thing if you like good things.	Ntho ena e ntle haeba u rata lintho tse ntle.
We will take what we can.	Re tla nka seo re ka se khonang.
To test the water.	Ho leka metsi.
I could not imagine it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e nahana.
So off we go.	Kahoo rea tsamaea.
They may have done so.	E ka 'na eaba ba entse joalo.
I walk for a week and the place falls.	Ke tsamaea ka beke 'me sebaka se oa.
There may be another long before that.	Ho ka ba le e 'ngoe nako e telele pele ho moo.
And somehow better than that.	'Me ka tsela e itseng e ntle ho feta bakeng sa eona.
The food was good.	Lijo li ne li le ntle.
The police will have to find him.	Mapolesa a tla tlameha ho mo fumana.
Let it stay.	E ke e lule.
But that is what he is.	Empa ke seo a leng sona.
He told me he was going to sleep now.	O ile a mpolella hore o tlo robala ha joale.
Or method.	Kapa mokhoa.
He said he never told anyone.	O ile a re ha ho mohla a kileng a bolella motho.
However, they can no longer exist.	Leha ho le joalo, li ke ke tsa hlola li e-ba teng.
I just finished reading that book.	Ke sa tsoa qeta ho bala buka eo.
I'm not sure how to do this.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka etsa sena joang.
I don't know, no one else.	Ha ke tsebe, ho se be e mong.
Everyone does this.	Batho bohle ba etsa sena.
But it is not too busy.	Empa ha ho phathahane haholo.
They really did not think about it.	Ha e le hantle ha baa ka ba nahana ka eona.
You will not have to look at him for long.	U ke ke ua tlameha ho mo sheba nako e telele.
I'm happy with our team.	Ke thabile ka sehlopha sa rona.
He was a great man, and he was strong.	E ne e le monna e moholo, a bile a le matla.
We do it every day.	Re e etsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
You do not know what to take.	Ha o tsebe hore na o ka nka eng.
It's up to you.	Ho ho uena.
It certainly seemed possible.	Ka sebele ho ne ho bonahala ho ka etsahala.
I slept a lot at night.	Ke ne ke robala haholo bosiu.
It would have been a great place.	E ka be e bile sebaka se setle.
Was he talking about you?	Na o ne a bua ka uena?
Maybe I'll come back to find more.	Mohlomong ke tla khutla ho fumana tse ling.
He always tells me.	O mpolella kamehla.
Or maybe you just didn't like your job, to begin with.	Kapa mohlomong ha o so ka o rata mosebetsi oa hau, ho qala.
But maybe they knew.	Empa mohlomong ba ne ba tseba.
We want a man like that.	Re batla monna ea joalo.
Like many of them.	Joalo ka ba bangata ba bona.
Is this right.	Na sena se hantle.
I can't win with him.	Ha ke khone ho hlola le eena.
You never asked what happened.	Ha ho mohla u kileng ua botsa hore na ho etsahetse'ng.
They are still dangerous.	Ba ntse ba le kotsi.
They are not guilty, they are not guilty.	Ha ba na molato, ha ba na molato.
I will buy that.	Ke tla reka seo.
They can be your friends.	E ka ba metsoalle ea hao.
However it was early in the morning.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e le hoseng.
He decided what he was going to do.	O ile a etsa qeto ea seo a tla se etsa.
Because he can take it.	Hobane a ka e nka.
I see you in the background.	Ke u bona ka morao.
Towards the end, there seemed to be some news.	Ho ea qetellong, ho ne ho bonahala ho e-na le litaba.
They come with water.	Ba tla le metsi.
He can know what to do with it.	A ka tseba hore na a etse eng ka eona.
He refused to do his homework.	O ile a hana ho etsa mosebetsi oa hae oa sekolo.
Do not talk about him.	U se ke ua bua ka eena.
They worked together for decades.	Ba ile ba sebetsa hammoho ka lilemo tse mashome.
Then she started to cry.	Eaba o qala ho lla.
Any time at all.	Nako efe kapa efe ho hang.
I know you do not see everything.	Kea tseba hore ha o bone tsohle.
Maybe at one time it was.	Mohlomong ka nako e 'ngoe ho ne ho le joalo.
Age certainly has its challenges.	Ka sebele lilemo li na le mathata.
You should.	U tlameha.
He knew nothing about his life now.	O ne a sa tsebe letho ka bophelo ba hae joale.
You want to be a man.	U batla ho ba monna.
It is better to go as it is.	Ho molemo ho tsamaea kamoo ho leng kateng.
The expert made his decision.	Setsebi se ile sa fana ka qeto ea sona.
I had no idea he would be here.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore o tla ba teng mona.
And it didn't matter.	Mme ho ne ho se taba.
One more day.	Letsatsi le leng hape.
Well, good news this morning.	Be, litaba tse monate hoseng hona.
They do not need to see.	Ha ho hlokahale hore ba bone.
It is not as difficult as it should be.	Ha e thata joalo ka ha e tlameha ho ba.
I do not like you.	Ha ke o rate.
This was not his home.	Mona e ne e se hae.
We would have heard before now if he had it.	Re ka be re utloile pele joale haeba a ne a e-na le eona.
Then he met his friends.	Eaba o kopana le metsoalle ea hae.
Very good thing.	Ntho e ntle haholo.
He never thought about where he was.	Le ka mohla a se ke a nahana ka moo a neng a le teng.
First my mother, then you.	Pele 'mè oa ka, joale uena.
It will not be very important.	E ke ke ea e-ba ea bohlokoa haholo.
If a woman speaks, it must refer to a man.	Haeba mosali a bua, e tlameha ebe e bua ka monna.
He just doesn't know.	O mpa a sa tsebe.
I hope someone can help.	Ke tšepa hore motho a ka thusa.
I made sure of it.	Ke ile ka etsa bonnete ba eona.
But he refused.	Empa a hana.
I really thought we had something for them today.	Ke ne ke hlile ke nahana hore re na le ho hong bakeng sa bona kajeno.
This is good for them.	Sena se molemo ho bona.
If you make a mistake, you must correct it.	Haeba u etsa phoso, u tlameha ho e lokisa.
There was nothing my mother could do about it.	Ho ne ho se letho leo ’Mè a neng a ka le etsa ka hona.
I am human.	Ke motho.
Provide what you would like to receive.	Fana ka seo u ka ratang ho se fumana.
He had nothing of this.	O ne a sena letho la sena.
When he saw my father.	Ha a bona ntate.
We will understand it.	Re tla e utloisisa.
Of course we do not know what happened.	Ha e le hantle ha re tsebe se etsahetseng.
I did not understand that.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise seo.
I don't know where to start.	Ha ke tsebe hore na nka qala kae.
That is where we need to be.	Ke hona moo re lokelang ho ba teng.
He did not know her.	O ne a sa mo tsebe.
I made a mistake by leaving her.	Ke entse phoso ka ho mo tlohela.
You need to do.	U hloka ho etsa.
We are human beings.	Re batho.
It gives us a lot easier.	E re fa bonolo haholoanyane.
It would be tomorrow and tomorrow.	Ho ne ho tla ba le hosane le hosane.
You have to think about what others might need.	U tlameha ho nahana ka seo ba bang ba ka se hlokang.
So, it is important to him.	Kahoo, ho bohlokoa ho eena.
The years helped to make it.	Lilemo li ile tsa thusa ho li etsa.
Probably not, not at all.	Mohlomong ha ho joalo, ha ho le joalo.
He spoke loudly.	O ile a bua ka matla.
They did not know his thoughts at all.	Ho hang ba ne ba sa tsebe maikutlo a hae.
You, more than anyone else, want to live.	Wena, ho feta ba bang bohle, o lakatsa ho phela.
Do the same with an adult.	Etsa joalo ka motho e moholo.
Not many would drink too much.	Hase ba bangata ba neng ba ka noa haholo.
Anyone can find one of them.	Mang kapa mang a ka fumana e 'ngoe ea tsona.
Kids can enjoy swimming here.	Bana ba ka thabela ho sesa mona.
Try to see what it is.	Leka ho bona hore na ke eng.
I did not try.	Ha kea ka ka leka.
I had to retire for this position.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho tlohela mosebetsi bakeng sa boemo bona.
You are that person.	U motho eo.
Maybe that's what he really was.	Mohlomong ke sona seo a neng a hlile a le sona.
They are worse than you know or think.	Li mpe ho feta kamoo u tsebang kapa ho nahana.
There are no police.	Ha ho na mapolesa.
If you can't read well, work on it.	Haeba u sa khone ho bala hantle, sebetsa ho eona.
But it was caught.	Empa ho ile ha tšoaroa.
They all want that other thing.	Kaofela ho batla ntho eo e 'ngoe.
He had never heard anything before.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a utloa letho pele.
Yet he does not want to leave.	Leha ho le joalo ha a batle ho tsamaea.
Will you help us?	O tla re thusa?
The father was driving.	Ntate eo o ne a khanna.
And it will be.	Mme ho tla ba jwalo.
Maybe it was true.	Mohlomong e bile 'nete.
You need to get out.	U hloka ho tsoa.
We had talked about this a lot of times.	Re ne re kile ra bua ka taba ena hangata.
These were just a few of them.	Tsena e ne e le tse seng kae feela tsa tsona.
I do not believe he does this to you.	Ha ke lumele hore o etsa sena ho uena.
And it worked.	'Me ea sebetsa.
Otherwise, he would have a better place to stay if.	Ntle ho moo, o ne a tla ba le sebaka se setle sa ho lula haeba.
Maybe it makes me go.	Mohlomong ho etsa hore ke tsamaee.
The woman enjoys her morning coffee.	Mosali o thabela kofi ea hae ea hoseng.
It does not matter.	Ha se taba.
The same is true of books.	Ho joalo le ka libuka.
and you can find them easy enough.	'me u ka li fumana li le bonolo ho lekana.
I do not want to see anyone.	Ha ke batle ho bona motho.
We were very happy.	Re ne re thabile haholo.
That's not good news for us, of course.	Ha se litaba tse molemo ho rona, ho hlakile.
I realize this.	Ke hlokomela sena.
He worked for both of them.	O ile a sebetsa bakeng sa bona ka bobeli.
He decided.	O ile a etsa qeto.
The process is simple.	Mokhoa ona o bonolo.
That's what the other man was.	Ke seo monna e mong e neng e le sona.
Then make sure you call them.	Joale etsa bonnete ba hore ua ba letsetsa.
We still do not know why they did it so well.	Re ntse re sa tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba entse joalo hantle.
She is delicious	A le monate
It was very painful.	Ho ne ho le bohloko haholo.
However, the food was very good.	Leha ho le joalo, lijo li ne li le ntle haholo.
She will know that you love her.	O tla tseba hore oa mo rata.
I don't know why.	Ha ke tsebe bakeng sa eng.
Let me speak.	E re ke bue.
The other man feels very happy because he got it.	Monna e mong o ikutloa a thabile haholo hobane o e fumane.
See you next week !.	Ke tla u bona bekeng e tlang!.
Maybe they had it.	Mohlomong ba ne ba e-na le eona.
Tell them your diet is taking a long time.	Ba bolelle hore lijo tsa hau li nka nako e telele.
And it was a good thing.	Mme e ne e le ntho e ntle.
I always thought that was a very painful time.	Kamehla ke ne ke nahana hore eo e ne e le nako e bohloko haholo.
It was like being a child again.	E ne eka ke ngoana hape.
The young man was crying.	Mohlankana eo o ne a lla.
As with your question.	Joalo ka potso ea hau.
They need you to know.	Ba hloka hore u tsebe.
I hope to meet him again.	Ke tšepa ho kopana le eena hape.
And it will only work if you ask.	'Me e tla sebetsa feela ha u botsa.
I would not expect you to do that.	Ke ne nke ke ka lebella hore u etse joalo.
Important.	Ea bohlokoa.
I was crying at my job.	Ke ne ke lla mosebetsing oa ka.
Better if they were there.	Ho betere haeba ba ne ba le teng.
This will be your room.	Ena e tla ba kamore ea hau.
Everyone knows how much we love it here.	E mong le e mong oa tseba hore na re e rata hakae mona.
Like a kind of genre.	Joalo ka mofuta oa mofuta.
They are very good.	Li ntle haholo.
My mother is busy right now.	Mme wa ka o phathahane hona jwale.
Better yet, she is so good for school.	Ho molemo le ho feta, o motle haholo bakeng sa sekolo.
It was a place.	E ne e le sebaka.
I just want to know if you're all right, baby.	Ke batla feela ho tseba hore na o hantle, ngoana.
I hope it has been good for you.	Ke tšepa hore ho bile molemo ho uena.
Not many did.	Ha se ba bangata ba ileng ba etsa joalo.
He has true news.	O na le litaba tsa 'nete.
However, that is the job.	Leha ho le joalo, ke mosebetsi oo.
I did it on time.	Ke e entse ka nako.
So this is very good for that.	Kahoo sena se molemo haholo bakeng sa seo.
That's one of the things.	Ke e 'ngoe ea lintho.
I better go now.	Ho molemo hore ke tsamaee hona joale.
It can stop, you think.	E ka ema, u nahana.
Each one of us.	E mong le e mong wa rona.
Besides, it was another day.	Ntle ho moo, e ne e le letsatsi le leng hape.
Several people go with him.	Batho ba ’maloa ba tsamaea le eena.
They finished work early and returned home.	Ba ile ba qeta mosebetsi pele ho nako ’me ba khutlela hae.
However, I do not know what he said.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe seo a se buileng.
I will do for others.	Ke tla re etsetsa ba bang.
I could not see very well.	Ke ne ke sa bone hantle.
So here's another question you need to ask yourself.	Kahoo potso e 'ngoe hape eo u lokelang ho ipotsa eona.
I have to give you something for your problem.	Ke lokela ho o fa ho hong bakeng sa bothata ba hao.
Eventually some people seem to start using it.	Qetellong ho bonahala batho ba bang ba qala ho e sebelisa.
It could not be anything like real life.	E ne e ke ke ea e-ba ntho leha e le efe e kang bophelo ba sebele.
I'm still passing.	Ke sa ntse ke feta.
And for good money too.	Le ka chelete e ntle hape.
I went into another room to pick it up.	Ke ile ka kena ka kamoreng e 'ngoe ho ea e nka.
It goes this way.	E tsamaea ka tsela ena.
She wants another child, and that's it.	O batla ngoana e mong, 'me ho joalo.
You were very lonely today.	U ne u le bolutu haholo kajeno.
We use it, or its kind, every day.	Re e sebelisa, kapa mofuta oa eona, letsatsi le letsatsi.
He will come anytime now.	O tla fihla neng kapa neng hona joale.
So this is not a question.	Kahoo sena ha se potso.
I felt alone.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke le mong.
I have done nothing good here.	Ha kea etsa letho le molemo mona.
I just want you.	Ke u batla feela.
He would do that.	O ne a tla etsa seo.
I have to do more.	Ke tlameha ho etsa ho feta.
The boy looked tired.	Moshanyana o ne a bonahala a khathetse.
After drinking, he fell asleep.	Ka mor'a ho noa, o ile a robala.
I was not here, last year.	Ke ne ke se mona, selemong se fetileng.
Still, it was worth it.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho bile molemo.
One of us will try it.	E mong oa rona o tla e leka.
I was just like that.	Ke ne ke le joalo feela.
He could not continue.	O ne a sa khone ho tsoela pele.
Anything they want to watch.	Eng kapa eng eo ba batlang ho e shebella.
In a way, they were.	Ka tsela e itseng, ba ne ba le joalo.
I believe, there is no better way.	Kea lumela, ha ho na tsela e molemo ho feta ena.
He played with her.	O ile a bapala le eena.
I'm just a girl.	Ke ngoanana feela.
I did not know the child.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ngoana.
There is nothing.	Ha ho letho.
I do not believe it will work.	Ha ke lumele hore e tla sebetsa.
Or it never seemed to come out.	Kapa ha ho mohla ho neng ho bonahala eka ho tsoa.
It was hard to let go of him.	Ho ne ho le thata ho mo tlohela.
There is no easy task.	Ha ho mosebetsi o bonolo.
But he goes to them.	Empa o ya bona.
I like to save money.	Ke rata ho boloka chelete.
It usually works well.	Hangata e sebetsa hantle.
Those were the best times.	Tseo e ne e le linako tse molemo ka ho fetisisa.
I don't know what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke eng.
Maybe you read them.	Mohlomong ua li bala.
Any woman would be.	Mosali ofe kapa ofe o ne a tla ba joalo.
I am still the only one.	Ke sa ntse ke le mong feela.
Neither was she.	Le eena o ne a se joalo.
I even do things in them.	Ke bile ke etsa lintho ho tsona.
But they are no longer there.	Empa ha ba sa le eo.
Probably, of course.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe, ha e le hantle.
I don't need to tell you.	Ha ke hloke ho o bolella.
Along with mine.	Hammoho le ea ka.
That's exactly our subject.	Ke eona taba ea rona hantle.
There are many of them.	Ho na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
It is very clear.	E hlakile haholo.
The children loved it.	Bana ba ne ba e rata.
I could only use my hands to swim.	Ke ne ke khona ho sebelisa matsoho a ka feela ho sesa.
I know nothing about this.	Ha ke tsebe letho ka sena.
And he told me he would look at it.	Mme a mpolella hore o tla e sheba.
Do not talk to him unless you have to.	U se ke ua bua le eena ntle le haeba u tlameha.
But there was no time for that.	Empa ho ne ho se nako ea seo.
But also books.	Empa le libuka.
He wants a big man.	O batla monna e moholo.
We had no water.	Re ne re se na metsi.
You may want to sleep all the time.	U ka 'na ua batla ho robala ka linako tsohle.
That doesn't matter.	Seo ha se na taba.
However, great work.	Leha ho le joalo, mosebetsi o moholo.
What do you want, he wondered.	O batla eng, a ipotsa.
I will go home too.	Le 'na ke tla ea hae.
I have always loved her.	Haesale ke mo rata.
Where are we going with this ?.	Re ea kae le see?.
I've never seen that, before.	Ha ke eso bone seo, pele.
We must overcome this.	Re tlameha ho hlola ena.
We know what the return means.	Rea tseba hore na ho khutla ho bolela eng.
Is he still waiting for her now.	Na o ntse a mo emetse hona joale.
And nobody ever seen that.	Mme haho motho ya kileng a bona seo.
It wasn't that he wanted her again, he didn't want her.	E ne e se hore o ne a mo batla hape, o ne a sa mo batle.
Obviously I did not do it for money.	Ho hlakile hore ha kea e etsa ka chelete.
He was happy.	O ne a thabile.
All you have to do is.	Seo u lokelang ho se etsa ke.
I want to learn from you.	Ke batla ho ithuta ho uena.
I don't think he did.	Ha ke nahane hore o ile a etsa joalo.
He continued to look at the car.	A tsoela pele ho sheba koloi.
It is up to the individual.	Ho ho motho ka mong.
Now it was time to return.	Joale ho ne ho se ho se ho khutla.
He is a strange man.	Ke motho ea makatsang.
I can't trust him.	Ha ke khone ho mo tšepa.
But it could have been anyone.	Empa e ka be e bile mang kapa mang.
You have to fix your head.	U tlameha ho lokisa hlooho.
The party was very fun.	Mokete o ne o le monate haholo.
Better than nothing.	Ho molemo ho feta letho.
You will find something.	U tla fumana ho hong.
I want to know about that person.	Ke batla ho tseba ka motho eo.
I would love to continue working all night.	Nka thabela ho tsoela pele ho sebetsa bosiu bohle.
I kept talking.	Ka nna ka bua.
You were not.	U ne u se uena.
He was strong.	O ne a le matla.
You have never been.	Ha o eso be teng.
It went for everything.	E ile ea ea ho tsohle.
But some people are coming.	Empa batho ba bang ba tla.
One of the most difficult.	E 'ngoe ea tse thata ka ho fetisisa.
This was his job.	Ona e ne e le mosebetsi oa hae.
There is nothing we can do about him.	Ha ho letho leo re ka le etsang ka eena.
They were no longer very pleasant.	Ba ne ba se ba se monate haholo.
They say they do not.	Ba re ha ba etse joalo.
I'm afraid it will eat you up.	Ke tšaba hore e tla u ja.
That did not do it, live and learn.	Seo ha se a ka sa e etsa, phela le ho ithuta.
Do not use it.	U se ke ua e sebelisa.
She is my wife.	Ke mosali oa ka.
He refused to join the group.	O ile a hana ho kena sehlopheng seo.
I could have told them that even before they started.	Nka be ke ile ka ba bolella seo le pele ba qala.
We are going.	Re ntse re ea.
I thought it was unnecessary.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ha ho hlokahale.
He was their second child.	E ne e le ngoana oa bona oa bobeli.
It’s your family, too.	Ke lelapa la hao, hape.
Then he had to bring it home.	Joale o ne a lokela ho tla le eona hae.
This girl.	Le ngoanana.
But he was not and he did not.	Empa o ne a se jwalo mme ha a ka a etsa jwalo.
Yes, yes, it must be.	E, e, e tlameha ho ba joalo.
We learn as we go along.	Re ithuta ha re ntse re tsoela pele.
And she was easy to look at.	Mme o ne a le bonolo ho mo sheba.
He was talking about many things.	O ne a bua ka lintho tse ngata.
Because there was nothing.	Hobane ho ne ho se na letho.
I had a wonderful evening.	Ke bile le mantsiboea a monate a monate.
He thought so.	O ne a nahana joalo.
But you had no way of knowing that.	Empa u ne u se na mokhoa oa ho tseba seo.
They did not do this.	Sena ha baa ka ba se etsa.
He lived with his father.	O ne a lula le ntate oa hae.
Instead, he sees it as an opportunity.	Ho e-na le hoo, o bona seo e le monyetla.
Here's what you need to do.	Mona ke seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
If it works for you, then it will work.	Haeba e sebetsa ho uena, joale e ea sebetsa.
I will try to be there ahead of time.	Ke tla leka ho ba teng pele ho nako.
When he wants to do something he does it.	Ha a batla ho etsa ntho e itseng o a e etsa.
No more pain.	Ha ho sa le bohloko.
It was a lot of fun to read.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo ho bala.
I saw what was happening.	Ke ile ka bona se neng se etsahala.
But we need you.	Empa rea ​​u hloka.
Or hear something about.	Kapa utloa ho hong ka.
They say they know your husband.	Ba re ba tseba monna wa hao.
And he is really easy to know.	'Me o hlile o bonolo ho tseba.
I wanted it to be better.	Ke ne ke batla hore e be betere.
He leaves, just once.	O tloha, hang feela.
Thank you so much to her.	Ke leboha haholo ho eena.
Do this once, well.	Etsa sena hang, hantle.
I never knew my father.	Ha ke eso tsebe ntate.
I hope you get enough.	Ke tšepa hore u tla fumana ho lekaneng.
I was starting to feel tired.	Ke ne ke qala ho ikutloa ke khathetse.
He didn't really matter to me.	O ne a se na taba ho nna hakaalo.
He was from here.	E ne e le oa mona.
Probably better they never met.	Mohlomong ho molemo ha ba sa ka ba kopana.
Perhaps it would continue for years.	Mohlomong e ne e tla tsoela pele ho tsoela pele ka lilemo.
Whatever he wanted, he gave it to her.	Eng kapa eng eo a e batlang, o ne a mo fa eona.
I am not a child.	Ha ke ngoana.
They can't tell us that, of course.	Ba ke ke ba re bolella hoo, ehlile.
I had to drive his car to his destination.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho khanna koloi ea hae ho ea sebakeng sa hae.
There was.	Ho ne ho le teng.
But that would require time and money.	Empa seo se ne se tla hloka nako le chelete.
That is not a problem.	Seo ha se bothata.
He was much older than she was.	O ne a le moholo ho eena haholo.
We are another family.	Re lelapa le leng.
Except, it is not.	Ntle le, ha ho joalo.
There have been many since then.	Ho bile le tse ngata ho tloha ka nako eo.
How you doing.	U ntse u phela joang.
However, that would come, in the end.	Leha ho le joalo, seo se ne se tla, qetellong.
It is not real to anyone.	Ha se ntho ea sebele ho mang kapa mang.
It consisted of three elements.	E ne e e-na le lintho tse tharo.
Her hair came out beautiful.	Moriri oa hae oa tsoa o le motle.
So we have a good place that way.	Kahoo re na le sebaka se setle ka tsela eo.
And so he came to me.	Mme kahoo a tla ho nna.
He had a strong mind.	O ne a e-na le kelello e matla.
I will be back soon.	Ke tla khutla haufinyane.
You just get it.	O e fumana feela.
Maybe he could live on them.	Mohlomong o ne a ka phela ka tsona.
I do not know how to do it.	Ha ke tsebe ho e etsa.
While they were driving my mother called.	Ha ba ntse ba khanna 'm'e a letsa.
You've done that before.	O kile wa etsa seo pele.
They are the people who will get the best out of it.	Ke batho ba tla fumana lintho tse molemo.
So much so.	Haholo joalo.
I wonder how long it has been there.	Kea ipotsa hore na e se e le nako e kae moo.
I do not know where he may be.	Ha ke tsebe moo a ka bang teng.
He had never seen a girl like him before.	O ne a qala ho bona ngoanana ea tšoanang le eena.
In the end, it doesn't matter.	Qetellong, ha ho na taba.
And it will not say how long it will take.	'Me ha ho na ho bolela hore na e ka nka nako e kae.
This is the way it is.	Ena ke tsela eo ho leng ka eona.
We'll get there tomorrow.	Re tla fihla moo hosane.
You know, it doesn't have to be this way.	Ua tseba, ha ea tlameha ho ba ka tsela ena.
So we had to make sure everything was in order.	Kahoo re ne re lokela ho etsa bonnete ba hore tsohle li sebetsa hantle.
Please sign in.	Kena ka kopo.
Or he thought he had it.	Kapa o ne a nahana hore o na le eona.
You took them just the way they were.	U li nkile feela kamoo li neng li le kateng.
And then, perhaps most importantly, you move on.	'Me joale, mohlomong sa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa, u tsoela pele.
Otherwise, drink.	Ho seng joalo, noa.
Otherwise, you can hear it.	Ntle ho moo, u ka e utloa.
I do not have much money.	Ha ke na chelete e ngata.
He is indeed a man.	Ehlile ke motho.
You use a lot of things to do that.	U sebelisa lintho tse ngata ho etsa joalo.
Well, there it is.	Be, ke eo.
The place was deserted.	Sebaka seo se ne se se na batho.
Just to help them finish a week of work.	E le ho ba thusa feela ho qeta beke ea mosebetsi.
Maybe he would go.	Mohlomong o ne a tla tsamaea.
I need a job.	Ke hloka mosebetsi.
They looked.	Ba ile ba sheba .
I looked at mine.	Ke ile ka sheba ea ka.
How it would feel to hold him again.	Ho ne ho tla ikutloa joang ho mo tšoara hape.
Tonight there will be a big party.	Bosiung bona ho tla ba le mokete o moholo.
Overnight for hours.	Bosiu ka lihora tse ngata.
They are in the back.	Ba ka morao.
I think everyone sees that.	Ke nahana hore bohle ba bona seo.
That was important.	Seo se ne se le bohlokoa.
He has heavy hands.	O na le matsoho a boima.
The second is not necessary.	Ea bobeli ha e hlokahale.
It helps a lot.	E thusa haholo.
Also, they may not do that.	Hape, ba ka 'na ba se ke ba etsa joalo.
It was fun talking to that girl.	Ho ne ho le monate ho bua le ngoanana eo.
It was hard work at the time.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima ka nako eo.
Too close to say.	Ho haufi haholo ho bolela.
He paid for this.	Sena a se lefa.
I think soon.	Ke nahana hore haufinyane.
He had to make a decision.	O ne a lokela ho etsa qeto.
Now she knows why she didn't keep their time.	Hona joale oa tseba hore na ke hobane’ng ha a sa ka a boloka nako ea bona.
I need this.	Ke hloka sena.
I think you will like it.	Ke nahana hore o tla e rata.
But it can be anywhere.	Empa e ka ba kae kapa kae.
This will make your job easier.	Sena se tla etsa hore mosebetsi oa hau o be bonolo haholoanyane.
I've been there before.	Ke bile moo pele.
I will have to write just one.	Ke tla tlameha ho ngola e 'ngoe feela.
I don't know what happened to me.	Ha ke tsebe se etsahetseng ka nna.
Now you have to take your own approach to doing so.	Joale u tlameha ho nka mokhoa oa hau oa ho etsa joalo.
Keep doing what you are doing !.	Tsoela pele ho etsa seo u se etsang!.
It was something else.	E ne e le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Did you see that!	Na u bone seo!
Then you will not have to pay for them.	Joale u ke ke ua tlameha ho li lefa.
I can say one more thing.	Nka bua ntho e 'ngoe ka ho fetisisa.
This is even better than the others.	Sena se molemo le ho feta tse ling.
Here people know us.	Mona batho ba re tseba.
He wanted to live.	O ne a batla ho phela.
We are not.	Ha re joalo.
He was having trouble sleeping.	O ne a na le bothata ba ho robala.
Maybe he's here.	Mohlomong o teng mona.
But he did not know why.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe lebaka.
He won the legal position.	O ile a hlola sebakeng sa molao.
I can trust him or forget him.	Nka mo tšepa kapa ka lebala.
It will not help you to refuse.	E ke ke ea u thusa ho hana.
He saw no work.	A bona ho se mosebetsi.
We never heard from them.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra utloa maikutlo a bona.
And here it is.	Mme ke ena.
That doesn't necessarily mean it's a good way to do it.	Seo ha se hakaalo hore ke tsela e ntle ea ho e etsa.
Of course, they did not tell you that.	Ehlile, ha ba ka ba o bolella seo.
Just one of you.	E mong feela wa lona.
He had never seen anything like it before.	O ne a eso bone ntho e kang ena pele.
It was a sad but beautiful feeling.	E ne e le maikutlo a bohloko empa a le motle.
What are you trying to tell me?	O leka ho mpolella eng?
You know you have to let him go.	Ua tseba hore u lokela ho mo tlohela.
They proceed with caution.	Ba tsoela pele ka hloko.
They come for him, that's why.	Ba tla bakeng sa hae, ke ka hona.
This is certainly not the case.	Ka sebele sena ha se joalo.
But now he is not sure who he is.	Empa joale ha a tsebe hantle hore na ke mang.
Not much time.	Ha ho nako e ngata.
That baby is beautiful.	Ngoana eo o motle.
But you will know in time.	Empa u tla tseba ka nako.
But something went wrong.	Empa ho na le ntho e ileng ea kena ho eena.
Her father recently passed away.	Ntate oa hae o sa tsoa hlokahala.
But you will have to try.	Empa u tla tlameha ho leka.
They needed help.	Ba ne ba hloka thuso.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
He saw it.	O ile a e bona.
This would be difficult.	Sena se ne se tla ba thata.
He had to work long hours.	O ne a lokela ho sebetsa lihora tse telele.
He did not have to wonder.	O ne a sa lokela ho ipotsa.
It may take one call.	E ka nka mohala o le mong.
So apparently, he said.	Kahoo ho bonahala, o ile a re.
However, it does not matter.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho na taba.
It has no idea.	Ha e na mohopolo.
I thought he would call.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tla letsa.
I really couldn’t take it that long.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa khone ho nka nako e telele hakana.
For a long time, most people did not know.	Ka nako e telele, batho ba bangata ba ne ba sa tsebe.
His hands were hard but soft.	Matsoho a hae a ne a le thata empa a le bonolo.
It is not at all dangerous.	Ho hang ha ho kotsi.
But then, he decided, it was not time.	Empa joale, o ile a etsa qeto, e ne e se nako.
I will go and find him.	Ke tla ea mo fumana.
I had received a letter.	Ke ne ke fumane lengolo.
Of course, this is not true.	Ha e le hantle, sena hase 'nete.
But it does not hurt.	Empa ha ho bohloko.
So much for that.	Haholo bakeng sa seo.
We've got some good ones and some bad ones.	Re fumane tse ling tse ntle le tse ling tse seng ntle hakaalo.
And it's good for them.	Mme e ntle ho bona.
Go!	Tsamaea!
Those things can be dangerous.	Lintho tseo li ka ba kotsi.
She was singing.	O ne a ntse a bina.
I thought he would go.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tla ea.
If you can, don't talk about it.	Haeba u khona, u se ke ua bua ka eona.
Do it your way.	E etse ka tsela ya hao.
Most of us will begin to do so.	Ba bangata ba rona re tla qala ho etsa joalo.
I need to learn it again.	Ke hloka ho e ithuta hape.
Maybe he just wanted to know what to expect.	Mohlomong o ne a batla ho tseba hore na a ka lebella eng.
You can do them with or without water.	U ka li etsa ka metsi kapa ntle le metsi.
We have never met.	Ha re eso kopane.
This year, he will eventually pass.	Selemong sena, qetellong o tla feta.
It is usually easy to say.	Hangata ho bonolo ho e bolela.
We were winning.	Re ne re hlola.
We have to go.	Re lokela ho tsamaea.
She does not mind.	Ha a tsotelle.
It was worse than the last, worse.	E ne e le mpe ho feta ea ho qetela, e mpe haholo.
No, it must be something else.	Che, e tlameha ebe ke ntho e 'ngoe hape.
This is not as easy a task as one might think.	Sena ha se mosebetsi o bonolo joalo ka ha motho a ka nahana.
However, not all people are like that.	Leha ho le joalo, hase bohle ba leng ka tsela eo.
That's what we're here for.	Ke seo re leng mona ka sona.
I should not have said that to you.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho bua joalo ho uena.
This is all.	Sena ke sohle.
There was danger every day.	Ho ne ho e-na le kotsi letsatsi le leng le le leng.
Think about your school days.	Nahana ka matsatsi a hau a sekolo.
I know that, now.	Ke tseba seo, jwale.
Both of these are very good in my opinion.	Tsena ka bobeli li ntle haholo ka maikutlo a ka.
Where you were driving out.	Moo u neng u khanna ho tsoa.
The last thing he needed was a fall.	Ntho ea ho qetela eo a neng a e hloka ke ho oa.
They wanted to know about it.	Ba ne ba batla ho tseba ka eona.
The important thing is that he did a good job.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore o entse mosebetsi o motle.
I will stand at home.	Ke tla ema hae.
This is a shame, man.	Sena ke lihlong, monna.
I mean it, though.	Kea e bolela, leha ho le joalo.
To the police, that is.	Ho mapolesa, ke hore.
He tends to work hard.	O tloaetse ho sebetsa ka thata.
He knew nothing.	O ne a sa tsebe letho.
That would be close to the truth.	Seo se ka ba haufi le 'nete.
His life, our life.	Bophelo ba hae, bophelo ba rona.
They certainly seem to enjoy the situation.	Ka 'nete ba bonahala ba thabela boemo boo.
There is another important type.	Ho na le mofuta o mong oa bohlokoa.
This was not to be.	Sena se ne se sa lokela ho ba joalo.
He has his own.	O na le ea hae.
Of course, someone wants that.	Ha e le hantle, ho na le motho ea batlang seo.
They were always looking for a son.	Ba ne ba lula ba batla mora.
But still, we try to read it.	Empa leha ho le joalo, re leka ho e bala.
It turned out good in the end.	E ile ea e-ba ntle qetellong.
I like work.	Ke rata mosebetsi.
They want to be healthy.	Ba batla ho phela hantle.
I'm not sure if that can happen.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na seo se ka etsahala.
It worked, over time.	E ile ya sebetsa, ka mora nako.
Live with it.	Phela le eona.
We have become very important to him.	Re se re le bohlokoa haholo ho eena.
Which is a very good thing.	E leng ntho e ntle haholo.
Nothing does anything.	Ha ho letho le etsang letho.
I have always loved her, as everyone else should.	Haesale ke mo rata, joalo ka ha e mong le e mong a tlameha.
Sure, really.	Ehlile, ehlile.
But it was very fun.	Empa ho bile monate haholo.
No, he could not speak now.	Che, o ne a sa khone ho bua hona joale.
I just want to win.	Ke batla ho hlola feela.
He rejected his proposal.	O ile a hana tlhahiso ea hae.
This is not a good idea.	Sena ha se mohopolo o motle.
That is not for a few days.	Seo ha se bakeng sa matsatsi a 'maloa.
Think about how to do it right.	Nahana ka mokhoa oa ho e etsa hantle.
This gives you some opportunity.	Sena se u fa monyetla o itseng.
But it does not have to be.	Empa ha ea lokela ho ba joalo.
She was not dressed the way she used to.	O ne a sa apara ka tsela eo a neng a tloaetse ho apara ka eona.
That is not the law, it is not.	Seo ha se molao, ha ho joalo.
What is wrong with you? 	Molato ke eng ka wena?
It was almost unnecessary.	Ho ne ho batla ho sa hlokahale.
he asked.	a botsa.
He is not one of you.	Ha se e mong wa lona.
Not long ago a young man returned home late.	Hase khale haholo mohlankana e mong o ile a khutlela hae ka mor’a nako.
I wanted to see him.	Ke ne ke batla ho mo bona.
I like the team.	Ke rata sehlopha.
No one is doing that anymore.	Ha ho sa na motho ea etsang joalo.
When you look at the type.	Ha o sheba mofuta.
You have no time.	Ha u na nako.
He thought so.	O ne a nahana joalo.
One approach was to give again.	Mokhoa o mong e ne e le ho fana hape.
He seemed to enjoy it.	O ne a bonahala a e thabela.
My mother always knew how to fix him.	’Mè o ne a lula a tseba ho mo lokisa.
So you can be in your team, yes.	Ho joalo le ka ba sehlopheng sa hau, e.
It does not matter.	Ha ho na taba.
He was not that strong.	O ne a se matla hakaalo.
Maybe next year.	Mohlomong selemong se tlang.
It got into the good work of why they should start with them.	Ho ile ha kena mosebetsi o motle oa hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba lokela ho qala le bona.
They did not even know what they were doing.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe le seo ba se etsang.
I had to give him that.	Ke ne ke lokela ho mo fa seo.
Then he went back to the front again.	Eaba o khutlela ka pele hape.
It's a long way to go, just the first day.	Ke tsela e telele ea ho tsamaea, letsatsi la pele feela.
I mean going forward.	Ke bolela ho ea pele.
Mine and yours.	Ya ka le ya hao.
It was a child to me.	E ne e le ngoana ho 'na.
Please make it a good one.	Ke kopa o e etse motho ea molemo.
He treated everyone well.	O ne a tšoara bohle hantle.
Please do not talk to me now.	Ke kopa o seke oa bua le 'na hona joale.
You can't look your best.	U ke ke ua shebahala hantle ka ho fetisisa.
They start talking.	Ba qala ho bua.
He wants one of them.	O batla e mong wa bona.
In the end, he did just that.	Qetellong, o ile a etsa joalo.
You may want to try it.	U ka 'na ua batla ho e leka.
The people looked very nice.	Batho ba ne ba shebahala ba le batle haholo.
To name just a few.	Ho bolela tse seng kae feela.
I thought he was going to be great.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tla ba moholo.
It has always been about money.	Haesale e le ka chelete.
That will save you a lot of time and money.	Seo se tla boloka nako le chelete e ngata.
They may need it.	Ba ka 'na ba e hloka.
It will be a great player.	E tla ba sebapali se hloahloa.
They did what they had.	Ba ile ba etsa seo ba neng ba e-na le sona.
Have you ever been to this room before?	Na o kile oa ea kamoreng ee pele?
But that's exactly right.	Empa ho joalo hantle.
He never did, and he never will.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo, 'me ha ho mohla a tla etsa joalo.
We love a big boy !!.	Re rata moshanyana e moholo!!.
And it certainly can be or not.	'Me ka sebele e ka ba kapa che.
I just called.	Ke sa tsoa letsa.
We want to give our opinion.	Re batla ho fana ka maikutlo a rona.
It is very difficult for a woman to no longer exist.	Ho thata haholo hore mosali a se ke a hlola a e-ba teng.
It was the first time I had seen them.	Ke ne ke qala ho ba bona.
It's such a wonderful feeling.	Ke maikutlo a monate joalo.
We are strong.	Re matla.
That's either good.	Ke kapa e ntle eo.
However, this was not the case.	Leha ho le joalo ho ne ho se joalo.
We would be happy to help you.	Re ka thabela ho u thusa.
It's fun to use.	Ho monate ho sebelisa.
We had a job to do and we did it.	Re ne re e-na le mosebetsi oo re lokelang ho o etsa ’me re ile ra o etsa.
I'm not sure, of course.	Ha ke na bonnete, ehlile.
I'm not sure about that.	Ha ke na bonnete ka seo.
I thought we were friends.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re metsoalle.
And then that.	Mme ebe seo.
That is what he wanted.	Ke seo a neng a se batla.
The boy refused to speak.	Moshanyana o ne a hana ho bua.
It certainly was ahead of its time.	Ka sebele e ne e le pele ho nako ea eona.
The reason is still simple.	Lebaka le ntse le le bonolo.
From all of them.	Ho tloha ho tsona kaofela.
No one slept on time.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a robala ka nako.
The team worked hard.	Sehlopha se ile sa sebetsa ka thata.
I do not know the mistake I made here.	Ha ke tsebe ho tseba phoso eo ke e entseng mona.
We can do whatever you want.	Re ka etsa eng kapa eng eo u e batlang.
Dinner last night and tonight from one.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea maobane bosiu le bosiung bona ho tloha ho 'ngoe.
Only you can come.	Ke uena feela ea tla.
He has already said no.	O se a ntse a re che.
For many years, they did not find work.	Ka lilemo tse ngata, ba ne ba sa fumane mosebetsi.
And that did not happen.	Mme seo ha se a etsahala.
It was all over.	E ne e le taba eohle.
Who knows he is with us.	Ke mang ea tsebang hore o na le rona.
There’s something to look out for here as well.	Ho na le seo u lokelang ho se sheba le mona.
He left to find work elsewhere.	O ile a tloha ho ea batla mosebetsi sebakeng se seng.
That is why this is happening.	Ke ka hona sena se etsahalang.
Maybe they'll hold him for me.	Mohlomong ba tla mo tšoara bakeng sa ka.
But imagine that there is no such thing.	Empa nahana hore ha ho letho le joalo.
I just work.	Ke sebetsa feela.
Anything will happen.	Ntho efe kapa efe e tla etsahala.
We love it so much.	Re rata haholo.
We want you to know about the problem.	Re batla hore o tsebe ka bothata.
There is nothing we can do.	Ha ho letho leo re ka le etsang.
They just make better sense.	Ba mpa ba etsa kelello e betere.
Or maybe.	Kapa mohlomong.
When you meet him, you can ask him about it.	Ha u kopana le eena, u ka mo botsa ka eona.
And you will find it.	Mme o tla e fumana.
Maybe it was worse than that.	Mohlomong e ne e le mpe ho feta moo.
They really want to do it.	Ba hlile ba batla ho e etsa.
I know this by heart.	Ke tseba sena ka hlooho.
There seemed to be no real life for him.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na bophelo ba sebele bakeng sa hae.
Then we went on to it.	Eaba re tsoela pele ho ea ho eona.
It's no use.	Ha ho na thuso.
To name a few.	Ho bolela tse seng kae.
They worked long hours.	Ba ne ba sebetsa lihora tse telele.
Everyone seemed happy.	E mong le e mong o ne a bonahala a thabile.
There is still much to do.	Ho ntse ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo u lokelang ho li etsa.
But you will definitely be fine.	Empa ka 'nete u tla phela hantle.
Yet he can.	Leha ho le joalo a ka khona.
Nobody trusted him.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a mo tšepa.
You need to join us.	U hloka ho kena le rona.
I like working.	Ke rata ho sebetsa.
I've never seen it before.	Ha ke so e bone pele.
Live and learn.	Phela le ho ithuta.
They can be dangerous for all of us.	Li ka ba kotsi ho rōna kaofela.
I loved those things.	Ke ne ke rata lintho tseo.
You still have them.	O ntse o na le tsona.
This is always important.	Sena se bohlokoa kamehla.
Then he thought about it.	Eaba o nahana ka eona.
I like the picture very much.	Ke rata setšoantšo haholo.
It's just a mistake.	Ke phoso feela.
Instead, we enjoy only food.	Ho e-na le hoo, re thabela lijo feela.
In time, you will enter.	Ka mor'a nako, u tla kena.
And that's what we did.	Mme ke seo re neng re se etsa.
With all the money.	Ka chelete eohle.
Maybe that's the problem.	Mohlomong bothata ke bona.
He will be present.	O tla be a bile teng.
It does not matter.	Ha ho na taba.
Water is essential.	Metsi ke a bohlokoa.
We will go to my house.	Re tla ea ha ka.
But it is useless.	Empa ha ho na thuso.
Or now.	Kapa hona joale.
He looked at her unconsciously as he spoke.	O ile a mo sheba a sa tsebe letho ha a ntse a bua.
Because, well, that wouldn't be fun.	Hobane, hantle, hoo ho ka se be monate.
I thought they were going to leave.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ba tla tsamaea.
That is not the case.	Ha se kamoo ho leng kateng.
That would do it.	Seo se ne se tla e etsa.
Except for one thing.	Ntle le ntho e le 'ngoe.
She is more beautiful.	O motle ho feta.
Well, think again.	Be, nahana hape.
I know what happened, and you know it.	Ke tseba se ileng sa etsahala, le wena o a tseba.
I've seen that.	Ke bone seo.
I do not know.	Ha ke tsebe.
Then you can see the value of each type.	Joale u ka bona bohlokoa ba mofuta o mong le o mong.
It was difficult to find a job.	Ho ne ho le thata ho batla mosebetsi.
The children are still at home from school.	Bana ba ntse ba le hae ho tsoa sekolong.
So we did.	Kahoo re ile ra etsa joalo.
I finally told them what they wanted to hear.	Qetellong ke ile ka ba bolella seo ba batlang ho se utloa.
I hope that will be fun.	Ke tšepa hore hoo ho tla ba monate.
I can't do it.	Nke ke ka e etsa.
We may not be the only ones who can do that.	E ke ke ea e-ba rōna feela ba ka etsang joalo.
Who knew what he was doing when he was not at work.	Ke mang ea neng a tseba hore na o etsa eng ha a se mosebetsing.
But that is what is happening here.	Empa ke sona se etsahalang mona.
I told him no.	Ke ile ka mo bolella che.
No one was easy enough for me to understand.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a le bonolo ka ho lekaneng hore ke utloisise.
So are you.	Le uena u joalo.
They returned home.	Ba ile ba khutlela hae.
It is still at work.	E ntse e le mosebetsing.
He loves to help people in times of need.	O rata ho thusa batho nakong ea mathata.
It was just his time.	E ne e le nako ea hae feela.
I know everything.	Ke tseba tsohle.
He would be the last man.	E ne e tla ba monna wa ho qetela.
He finally arrived home.	Qetellong o ile a fihla ha hae.
I am still as they say,.	Ke ntse ke le joalo ka ha ba re,.
I really do this.	Ke hlile ke etsa sena.
he asked.	a botsa.
However, this is very difficult for this problem.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se boima haholo bakeng sa bothata bona.
I have it now.	Ke na le hona joale.
He can do better than that.	A ka etsa betere ho feta moo.
Save money.	Boloka chelete.
He did not know if this thing would work.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ntho ena e tla sebetsa.
It was his only real moment.	E ne e le eona feela nako ea hae ea sebele.
I live here.	Ke lula mona.
He too.	Le eena.
There is one thing though.	Ho na le ntho e le 'ngoe leha ho le joalo.
And there is a group car.	Mme ho na le koloi ea sehlopha.
It has one or more people.	E na le motho a le mong kapa ho feta.
As of now.	Joalo ka ha joale.
It will be for someone else.	E tla ba bakeng sa e mong.
It is my decision for the new year.	Ke qeto ea ka ea lilemo tse ncha.
We eat a lot, he says.	Re ja haholo, o re.
One day, a boy does that.	Ka letsatsi le leng, mohlankana e mong o etsa joalo.
I did not ask about myself.	Ha kea botsa ka 'na.
Maybe there's no way they should do it.	Mohlomong ha ho tsela eo ba lokelang ho e etsa.
It is a difficult place to be.	Ke sebaka se thata ho ba ho sona.
We are confident that we will win.	Re na le bonnete ba hore re tla hlola.
I wanted someone to know.	Ke ne ke batla hore motho e mong a tsebe.
It didn't tell me anything at all.	Ha ea mpolella letho ho hang.
Now you have a decision to make.	Joale u na le qeto eo u lokelang ho e etsa.
I looked at him.	Ka mo sheba.
We are not what happens to us.	Ha re se etsahalang ho rona.
This is a very simple procedure.	Ena ke mokhoa o bonolo haholo.
But he was giving it away.	Empa o ne a fana ka eona.
It all starts with how you start.	Tsohle li qala ka hore na o qala joang.
But he did not say much.	Empa o ne a sa bue hakaalo.
What we were.	Seo re neng re le sona.
The hair is.	Moriri ke.
From before we met.	Ho tloha pele re kopana.
Everything was what, where and how, why, why, why.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e ne e le efe, hokae le joang, hobaneng, hobaneng, hobaneng.
We can be one of them.	Re ka ba e mong oa bona.
But that may not be so bad.	Empa hoo e ka ’na ea se be ntho e mpe hakaalo.
I would appreciate any help.	Nka thabela thuso efe kapa efe.
i would like it	nka e rata.
I hope you come back.	Kea tšepa u tla khutla.
That's really my point.	Ehlile ke taba ea ka eo.
We will not go back.	Re ke ke ra khutlela morao.
I don't know if that's a good thing.	Ha ke tsebe haeba hoo ke ntho e ntle.
It is right behind the house.	E hantle ka mora ntlo eo.
No one could say for sure why they were there.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka bolela hore na ba ne ba le moo ka lebaka la eng.
They have never met legally.	Ha ba eso kopane ka molao.
It is not too late for us.	Ha e-so be morao haholo bakeng sa rona.
He always pays with money.	O lefa ka chelete kamehla.
Now, he thought.	Jwale, a nahana.
When you come.	Ha o tla.
But, it didn't work.	Empa, ha ea sebetsa.
He had never seen the value of trying.	O ne a e-s'o bone bohlokoa ba ho leka.
I still do not.	Ke ntse ke sa etse joalo.
I don't see anything we can do right now.	Ha ke bone letho leo re ka le etsang hona joale.
However it was useless.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e se na thuso.
Now you know.	Joale ua tseba.
I needed something to work on, right away.	Ke ne ke hloka ho hong ho sebetsa, hang.
I could see that passing here.	Ke ne ke bona seo se feta mona.
However, this is no longer the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se sa le joalo.
He can't do that.	A ka se etse seo.
I see everything, I hear everything.	Ke bona tsohle, ke utloa tsohle.
It's fun to work with.	Ho monate ho sebetsa le.
He realized what had happened.	O ile a hlokomela se etsahetseng.
He had never said so much, and he would never have said it.	O ne a eso bue hakaalo, mme le ka mohla o ne a ke ke a bua.
My stomach ached.	Mpa ea ka e ne e utloa bohloko.
It is very dangerous now.	Ho kotsi haholo jwale.
Maybe it will be better for someone else.	Mohlomong e tla ba molemo ho motho e mong.
I knew it was going on.	Ke ne ke tseba hore e ntse e tsoela pele.
Of course, only a person knows that he is alive.	Ke ’nete hore ke motho feela ea tsebang hore oa phela.
He felt it was right to do so.	O ile a utloa ho le molemo ho etsa joalo.
There is some truth there.	Ho na le 'nete e itseng moo.
They would talk about that, too.	Ba ne ba tla bua ka seo, le bona.
Do not look in the room.	U se ke ua sheba ka kamoreng.
Think about how long it is.	Nahana hore na ke nako e kae.
He certainly did not.	Ka sebele ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
Or maybe it was just me.	Kapa mohlomong e ne e le nna feela.
We have a room here.	Re na le kamore mona.
Maybe he saw someone else.	Mohlomong o ne a bona motho e mong.
I went home, crying.	Ke ile ka ea hae, ke lla.
Keep asking why they are saying things in a certain way.	Lula u botsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba bua lintho ka tsela e itseng.
If you feel like you want to be arrested.	Haeba u ikutloa eka u batla ho tšoaroa.
You returned with the first man you loved.	U ile ua khutlela le monna oa pele eo u neng u mo rata.
He would walk beside them.	O ne a tla tsamaea haufi le bona.
And we had the last day.	'Me re ne re e-na le letsatsi la ho qetela.
And this will be the case.	'Me sena se tla ba joalo.
She does not mind.	Ha a tsotelle.
It's easier than that.	Ho bonolo ho feta.
Yet this is exactly what happened.	Leha ho le joalo sena ke sona se etsahetseng.
I will fall.	ke tla oa.
That can help.	Seo se ka thusa.
Then we do it again.	Ebe re e etsa hape.
But they stay there for a while.	Empa ba hlola moo nako e itseng.
He did not want to talk.	O ne a sa batle ho bua.
Really weird stuff.	Lintho tse makatsang ruri.
He asked her if there was something wrong.	O ile a mo botsa hore na ho na le phoso.
They all have some truth in them.	Bohle ba na le 'nete e itseng ho bona.
Here is the point.	Taba ke ena.
This comes before everything else.	Sena se tla pele ho tse ling tsohle.
Maybe there is an easier way.	Mohlomong ho na le tsela e bonolo.
What you think.	Seo u se nahanang.
If we find children's clothes, we take them.	Haeba re fumana liaparo tsa bana, rea li nka.
I felt the same way.	Le ’na ke ne ke ikutloa joalo.
That was one of the first things you noticed about him.	Eo e bile e ’ngoe ea lintho tsa pele tseo u ileng ua li hlokomela ka eena.
Someone did the same to me.	Ho na le motho ea entseng joalo le ho 'na.
It seemed obvious.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho hlakile.
It should not happen this way.	Ha ea lokela ho etsahala ka tsela ena.
I stood for a few hours and tried again.	Ke ile ka ema lihora tse seng kae eaba ke leka hape.
I was not in danger.	Ke ne ke se kotsing.
You were still alive that night.	O ne o ntse o phela bosiung boo.
It doesn't have to be complicated.	Ha ho hlokahale hore e be thata.
Everyone knows now.	E mong le e mong oa tseba hona joale.
I did not want to talk.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho bua.
Maybe he did not think so.	Mohlomong o ne a sa nahane joalo.
However, he did not return.	Leha ho le joalo, ha aa ka a khutla.
No, though.	Che, leha ho le joalo.
Because they had something strange.	Hobane ba ne ba e-na le ntho e makatsang.
It will be the same with everyone.	Ho tla ba joalo le bohle.
Life would have been easier for me.	Bophelo bo ka be bo bile bonolo ho ’na.
And of course, he loved it.	'Me ha e le hantle, o ne a e rata.
This is all he can do.	Sena ke sohle seo e ka se etsang.
The family thought it would be better for him.	Lelapa le ile la nahana hore ho tla ba molemo ho eena.
I'll tell you what happens.	Ke tla o bolella seo se etsahala.
I was happy to have someone to talk to.	Ke ile ka thabela ho ba le motho eo nka buang le eena.
Or to talk about it.	Kapa ho bua ka eona.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke na bonnete.
I am here in his place.	Ke mona sebakeng sa hae.
But I could not sleep.	Empa ke ne ke sitoa ho robala.
It was his job to use it only.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa hae ho e sebelisa feela.
Whatever it was, he knew nothing.	Hoo e ka ba eng, o ne a sa tsebe letho.
I reached out to her.	Ke ile ka mo fihlela.
This will not be helpful.	Sena ha se na ho ba le thuso.
I stared at her for hours.	Ke ile ka mo shebella ka lihora tse ngata.
They must give the money they already have.	Ba tlameha ho fana ka chelete eo ba seng ba ntse ba e-na le eona.
It was hard to get to the end.	Ho ne ho le thata ho fihlela qetellong.
You need more than that.	O hloka ho feta moo.
It kept his strength.	E ile ya boloka matla a hae.
It was a strange feeling.	E ne e le maikutlo a makatsang.
He did not continue.	Ha a ka a tsoela pele.
I will never forget you!	Nke ke ka u lebala!
I could find nothing else in him.	Ke ne nke ke ka fumana letho le leng ho eena.
We think this way.	Re nahana ka tsela ena.
Monday is the first day of the week.	Mantaha ke letsatsi la pele la beke.
Of course they know it well.	Ehlile ba e tseba hantle.
He spoke to the whole group.	A bua le sehlopha sohle.
And there were others who did not.	Mme ho ne ho e-na le ba bang ba sa kang ba etsa joalo.
But it would not be so easy.	Empa ho ne ho sa tlo ba bonolo hakaalo.
They will pay.	Ba tla lefa.
Baby, she thought.	Ngoana, a nahana.
So you have to do it.	Kahoo o lokela ho e etsa.
I know you are expecting news from us.	Kea tseba hore u lebeletse litaba ho rona.
When the opportunity comes to eat with the strong we take it.	Ha monyetla o fihla oa ho ja le ba matla rea ​​o nka.
Read about it here.	Bala ka eona mona.
I could not do everything while caring for the baby.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho etsa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ha ke ntse ke hlokomela ngoana.
There is someone here.	Ho na le motho mona.
I am responsible for this.	Ke molato oa sena.
That is not the case here.	Ha se eena taba mona.
Really? 	Ehlile?
you said.	u itse.
I stand, I stand, then I stand again.	Ke ema, ke ema, ebe ke ema hape.
He always says that.	O bolela seo kamehla.
They knew about the work we were doing.	Ba ne ba tseba ka mosebetsi oo re o etsang.
He did so very often.	O ne a etsa joalo hangata haholo.
He too looked at her.	Le eena o ile a mo shebella.
They all leave here.	Bohle ba tloha mona.
He will not come.	A ke ke a tla.
It was very easy what he was doing.	E ne e le bonolo haholo seo a neng a se etsa.
But they are.	Empa ba.
I loved everything he did.	Ke ne ke rata ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe eo a neng a e etsa.
And it could be anything.	'Me e ka ba eng kapa eng.
Maybe that was good.	Mohlomong hoo ho ne ho le molemo.
This is more fun.	Sena se monate ho feta.
They all learned.	Kaofela ba ile ba ithuta.
I did not request this.	Ha kea ka ka kopa sena.
But try.	Empa leka.
I need to fix my life.	Ke hloka ho lokisa bophelo ba ka.
I certainly went there.	Ka sebele ke ile ka ea moo.
He started a new diet.	O ile a qala lijo tse ncha.
I want to tell you more.	Ke batla ho le bolella le ho feta.
Try to learn from them.	Leka ho ithuta ho bona.
I have not spoken to you in three days.	Ke na le matsatsi a mararo ke sa bue le wena hantle.
Almost every one of them did.	Hoo e ka bang e mong le e mong oa bona o ile a etsa joalo.
But still, that's what they say to us.	Empa leha ho le joalo, ke seo ba se buang ho rona.
I feel it happens a little bit every day.	Ke utloa e etsahala hanyane letsatsi le letsatsi.
You will forget why you are there.	U tla lebala hore na ke hobane'ng ha u le moo.
Sometimes they even spent the night.	Ka linako tse ling ba ne ba bile ba qeta bosiu.
I'm still afraid they'll leave.	Ke ntse ke tšaba hore ba tla tloha.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
They said they would do this.	Ba itse ba tla etsa sena.
They had no way to get in.	Ba ne ba sena tsela ya ho kena.
He did not speak during the meal.	O ne a sa bue nakong ea lijo.
I need to fix this.	Ke hloka ho lokisa sena.
Can't you see?	Na ha o bone?
I hope it will fix this problem.	Ke tšepa hore e tla lokisa bothata bona.
Nothing others do because of you.	Ha ho seo ba bang ba se etsang ka lebaka la hao.
He stayed there that night.	O ile a hlola moo bosiung boo.
The police came out forcefully.	Mapolesa a ile a tsoa ka matla.
I learned to love them more than I love myself.	Ke ile ka ithuta ho ba rata ho mpheta.
And she goes to sleep.	Mme o ya robala.
He lives in me.	O phela ka ho nna.
Things were going well.	Lintho li ne li tsamaea hantle.
Eventually I would get that opportunity.	Qetellong ke ne ke tla fumana monyetla oo.
But there was a problem with that.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le bothata ka seo.
You were here to have children, and you did not have children.	U ne u le mona ho tla ba le bana, ’me ha ua ka ua ba le bana.
They will do anything with the money.	Ba tla etsa eng kapa eng ka chelete.
He tells me why.	O mpolella lebaka.
He was alone.	O ne a le mong.
Make it visible.	Etsa hore e bonahale.
She was a schoolteacher.	E ne e le tichere ea sekolo.
Thinking and reasoning.	Ho nahana le ho nahana.
But, this is up to you.	Empa, sena se ho uena.
Maybe that's the way you think it should be.	Mohlomong ke ka tsela eo u nahanang hore e lokela ho ba ka eona.
I hope one day I will visit you.	Ke tšepa hore ka letsatsi le leng ke tla u etela.
You eat a lot.	U ja haholo.
The problem is money.	Bothata ke chelete.
How do you get there?	U tsamaea joang moo?
One reason is that it is not necessary.	Lebaka le leng ke hore ha ho hlokahale.
Of course, though.	Ha e le hantle, leha ho le joalo.
Hard question!	Potso e thata!
They didn't know it.	Ba ne ba sa e tsebe.
There is no money for them.	Ha ho chelete bakeng sa bona.
You just want it too bad for the baby.	U mpa u batla hore e mpe haholo bakeng sa ngoana.
But that is no longer the case.	Empa ha e sa le joalo.
I didn’t think it would be good.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore ho tla ba molemo.
Keep working hard.	Tsoela pele ho sebetsa ka thata.
I am single.	Ha ke na motho.
There weren’t many.	Ho ne ho se na tse ngata.
Maybe I like you.	Mohlomong kea u rata.
Not so with me.	Ha ho joalo ka nna.
And well, it was for me.	Mme hantle, e ne e le bakeng sa ka.
We took that time.	Re nkile nako eo.
And he knew a lot about many things.	'Me o ne a tseba haholo ka lintho tse ngata.
We know the family.	Re tseba lelapa.
You do it well.	U e etsa hantle.
It is important to preserve a person's life.	Ho bohlokoa ho boloka bophelo ba motho.
I can't even read this.	Ha ke khone le ho bala sena.
If you want to win, you will have to work hard.	Haeba u batla ho hlola, u tla tlameha ho sebetsa ka thata.
It has certainly been helpful.	Ka sebele e bile le molemo.
They no longer need money.	Ha ba sa hloka chelete.
He did just that.	O ile a etsa joalo.
It is, and it will be.	Ho jwalo, mme ho tla ba jwalo.
I will work with this.	Ke tlo sebetsa le sena.
Decide if necessary.	Etsa qeto haeba ho hlokahala.
Sometimes you may not be able to get what you want.	Ka linako tse ling ha u khone ho fumana seo u se batlang.
In fact, it helped.	Ha e le hantle, e ile ea thusa.
Our friends will be there too.	Metsoalle ea rōna le eona e tla ba teng.
So far, so far.	Ho fihlela joale, ho fihlela joale.
Wear good shoes.	Apara lieta tse ntle.
I have my own car.	Ke na le koloi ea ka.
I wanted them to take you.	Ke ne ke batla hore ba u nke.
Sometimes we do not even get our own food.	Ka linako tse ling ha re fumane le ho ja lijo tsa rona.
Knowing your problem is like that.	Ho tseba bothata ba hau ho joalo.
He looked like that.	O ne a shebahala a le joalo.
That should fix it.	Seo se lokela ho e lokisa.
I want you to do what you want to do.	Ke batla hore o etse seo o batlang ho se etsa.
Great place to play well.	Sebaka se setle sa ho bapala hantle.
The fact is, nothing could be further from the truth.	'Nete ke hore, ha ho letho le monate joalo.
They are many of us.	Ke ba bangata ba rona.
Good job, if you can get it.	Mosebetsi o motle, ha o ka o fumana.
Maybe the letter is mine.	Mohlomong lengolo ke la ka.
We mean more than that.	Re bolela ho feta moo.
I don't know where it is now.	Ha ke tsebe moo e leng teng ha jwale.
He just stood there.	A ema moo feela.
I wondered what I could do.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na nka etsa joang.
Maybe it will be you, too.	Mohlomong e tla ba uena, le uena.
He never looked at her again.	Ha a ka a hlola a mo sheba hape.
I could have stayed for hours.	Nka be ke ile ka lula lihora tse ngata.
Think about others.	Nahana ka ba bang.
The group continues.	Sehlopha se tsoela pele.
It will be a wonderful day.	E tla ba letsatsi le monate.
Something at a time.	Ho hong ka nako.
He loves you very much.	O o rata haholo.
My mother did what she had to do.	’Mè o ile a etsa seo a neng a lokela ho se etsa.
You have to work that way.	O lokela ho sebetsa ka tsela eo.
I waited a long time to be with him at the end.	Ke ile ka ema nako e telele hore ke be le eena qetellong.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke na bonnete.
The mood was good.	Maikutlo a ne a le ntle.
We are all here to learn something.	Kaofela re mona ho ithuta ho hong.
Of course, that may not be necessary.	Ha e le hantle, seo se ka 'na sa se ke sa hlokahala.
Like it or not.	Rata kapa che.
There are many of them coming.	Ho na le ba bangata ba bona ba tlang.
The news is amazing.	Litaba ke tse makatsang.
But no, there was no one like him.	Empa che, ho ne ho se motho ea tšoanang le eena.
It seems to be my mind for me.	Ho bonahala eka ke mohopolo oa ka ho nna.
He loves us so much.	O re rata haholo.
I'm not very helpful.	Ha ke na thuso haholo.
I do not know if that is possible.	Ha ke tsebe haeba ho ka etsahala.
But it would not be.	Empa ho ne ho ka se be teng.
Playing it should be fun.	Ho e bapala ho lokela ho ba monate.
Problem with positive thinking.	Bothata ba ho nahana hantle.
But we know we have life.	Empa rea ​​tseba hore re na le bophelo.
And we come to an empty room.	Mme re fihla phaposing e se nang letho.
Then they left.	Eaba ba tsamaea.
These issues are very important.	Litaba tsena li bohlokoa haholo.
Child.	Ngoana.
No one else needs us.	Ha ho na motho e mong ea re hlokang.
We did a great job.	Re entse mosebetsi o motle.
But they did not do that.	Empa ha ba ka ba etsa seo.
So who is it?	Joale ke mang?
I forgot that for a few hours, but it is true.	Ke ile ka lebala seo ka lihora tse 'maloa, empa ke' nete.
However, too long.	Leha ho le joalo, nako e telele haholo.
Talk about it.	Bua ka eona.
I thought that would work.	Ke ne ke nahana hore seo se ka sebetsa.
I do it a lot.	Ke e etsa haholo.
I own it.	Ke mong oa eona.
A good worker must be able to do that work.	Mosebetsi ea hloahloa o lokela ho khona ho etsa mosebetsi oo.
It made me think.	E ile ea etsa hore ke nahane.
Never, ever happened.	Ha ho mohla, ho kileng ha etsahala.
I got it.	Ke e fumane.
I didn’t think anything would be enough.	Ke ne ke sa nahane ka ntho leha e le efe e neng e tla lekana.
We arrived.	Re ile ra fihla.
You can do the same.	U ka etsa ntho e tšoanang.
More than a day before.	Ho feta letsatsi pele.
This book is very helpful.	Buka ena e thusa haholo.
But he was sure.	Mme o ne a na le bonnete.
I finally understood.	Qetellong ke ile ka utloisisa.
He wanted something, something from your father.	O ne a batla ntho e 'ngoe, ho hong ho tsoa ho ntate oa hau.
Me too.	Le 'na.
It was clear that something was wrong.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore ho na le ho hong.
We worked hard to get here.	Re ile ra sebetsa ka thata ho fihla mona.
I always try to keep everything simple.	Ke lula ke leka ho boloka ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e le bonolo.
Then he picked up the phone and called her.	Eaba o nka mohala o mo letsetsa.
They are beautiful.	Li ntle.
You can't eat anything.	U ke ke ua ja ntho leha e le efe feela.
It occurs during going to sleep mode.	E etsahala nakong ea ho ea ho mokhoa oa ho robala.
They won't want to do it.	Ba ke ke ba batla ho e etsa.
Try to move on with your life.	Leka ho tsoela pele ka bophelo ba hau.
But it was able to go beyond that.	Empa e ile ea khona ho feta moo.
I had the same problem.	Ke ne ke e-na le bothata bo tšoanang.
I could not say anything.	Ke ne nke ke ka bua letho.
This method would be very simple.	Mokhoa ona o ne o tla ba bonolo haholo.
You have to be a team player.	U tlameha ho ba sebapali sa sehlopha.
But that does not exist or there.	Empa seo ha se teng kapa hona moo.
You know you belong to me.	Ua tseba hore u oa 'na.
No, no.	Che, che.
I decided to wear it behind the ear.	Ke entse qeto ea ho e apara ka mor'a tsebe.
It was more than that, more than that.	E ne e le ho feta moo, ho feta moo.
But you can't get past them.	Empa u ke ke ua feta ho tsona.
One can hear it.	Motho a ka e utloa.
It's really fun there too.	Ho monate haholo moo hape.
He was looking for a job.	O ne a batla mosebetsi.
Tomorrow, we will both be better.	Hosane, ka bobeli re tla be re le betere.
She started to get dressed.	O ile a qala ho apara.
We need to understand that there is a problem.	Re lokela ho utloisisa hore bothata bo teng.
But it was too late to do anything about it.	Empa e ne e se e le morao haholo ho etsa letho ka hona.
And she was beautiful.	Mme o ne a le motle.
What will you do with the money?	U tla etsa joang ka chelete?
They can see.	Ba ka bona.
No one could say he did not love his children.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka re ha a rate bana ba hae.
It wants more people tonight.	E batla batho ba bangata bosiung bona.
The hardest for you.	E thata ka ho fetisisa ho uena.
So, if he was looking for a job, he had to stay.	Kahoo, haeba a ne a ntse a batla mosebetsi, o ne a lokela ho lula a le teng.
Of this group.	Ea sehlopha sena.
She will be fine.	O tla phela hantle.
But maybe we should look at it this way.	Empa mohlomong re lokela ho e sheba ka tsela ena.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha ho joalo.
More people came in than out.	Batho ba bangata ba ile ba kena ho feta ho tsoa.
Do it again.	E etse hape.
How can I fix the problem.	Nka lokisa bothata joang.
I will call her as soon as we get home.	Ke tla mo letsetsa hang ha re fihla hae.
We could not do that.	Re ne re ke ke ra etsa joalo.
He looked at his hands.	A sheba matsoho a hae.
Your father will not continue to take care of you.	Ntate oa hao a ke ke a tsoela pele ho u hlokomela.
They mean something to you.	Ba bolela ho hong ho wena.
It does not take much.	Ha e nke haholo.
It has been to others before.	E bile ho ba bang pele.
Thank you to each and every one of you.	Ke leboha e mong le e mong wa lona.
After that, everything goes well.	Ka mor'a moo, tsohle li tsamaea hantle.
Because before you know it, they'll probably be back together.	Hobane pele u tseba, mohlomong ba tla khutlela hammoho.
I knew it for sure.	Ke ne ke e tseba ka 'nete.
This was fun.	Sena se ne se le monate.
But they will see.	Empa ba tla bona.
I hope you will be back soon !.	Kea tšepa u tla khutla haufinyane!.
Soon, everyone is having a wonderful time.	Haufinyane, e mong le e mong o ba le nako e monate haholo.
However, soon.	Leha ho le joalo, haufinyane.
No one said anything.	Ha ho motho ya ileng a bua letho.
In fact, they may well go on for years.	Ha e le hantle, ba ka 'na ba qeta lilemo tse ngata ba ntse ba tsoela pele.
You only have to do it once.	U tlameha ho e etsa hang feela.
Stay with me here.	Dula le nna mona.
We will understand this.	Re tla utloisisa sena.
Nice to meet you.	Ke thabetse ho kopana le uena.
I can't walk.	Ha ke khone ho tsamaea.
Maybe he should wait until he calls.	Mohlomong o lokela ho ema ho fihlela a letsa.
He said to her.	O ile a re ho eena.
It is already beginning to.	E se e qala ho.
It would not be good if we wanted to have children.	Ho ke ke ha e-ba molemo haeba re batla ho ba le bana.
I will continue.	Ke tla tsoela pele.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
I would take some time, now.	Nka nka nako, jwale.
You know, people come and go.	Ua tseba, batho baa tla ba tsamaea.
We tried to have children for a long time.	Re ile ra leka ho ba le bana ka nako e telele.
I did not know until today.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ho fihlela kajeno.
I did not find anything.	Ha kea ka ka fumana letho.
She felt alive again, feeling better.	O ile a ikutloa a phela hape, a ikutloa hantle.
That was really weird.	Seo e ne e hlile e le ntho e makatsang.
We did it well.	Re ne re e etsa hantle.
Work, go to school, be good.	Sebetsa, kena sekolo, u be molemo.
I was not in the least bit hurt.	Ha kea utloa bohloko hanyane.
We spend our lives playing it.	Re qeta bophelo ba rona re e bapala.
Your time is precious, more important than mine.	Nako ea hau ke ea bohlokoa, ea bohlokoa ho feta ea ka.
I knew how hard it was to look good in that place.	Ke ne ke tseba hore na ho ne ho le thata hakae ho shebahala hantle sebakeng seo.
Then he saw.	Joale o ile a bona.
But still.	Empa leha ho le joalo.
She does a very good job at her job.	O sebetsa hantle haholo mosebetsing wa hae.
You would have it too.	Le uena u ne u tla ba le eona.
I can see right through you.	Ke bona hantle ka wena.
Nice to hear what you have to say !.	Ke thabela ho utloa seo u se buang!.
It is very dangerous.	Ho kotsi haholo.
I hope you are doing well.	Ke tšepa hore u sebetsa hantle.
Go ahead carefully!	Tsoela pele ka hloko!
My breakfast.	Lijo tsa ka tsa hoseng.
You take too many people.	U nka batho ba bangata haholo.
You can do more than you think.	U ka etsa ho feta kamoo u nahanang kateng.
Someone will write.	Motho e mong o tla ngola.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
He was done.	O ne a qetile.
Now, long, long and long.	Hona joale, nako e telele, e telele le e telele.
And it will not be.	'Me ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
I want her to have a better life.	Ke batla hore a be le bophelo bo betere.
This should be fun.	Sena se lokela ho ba monate.
I did the same.	Ke entse eona eo.
Be very careful here.	Hlokomela haholo mona.
He did not know.	O ne a eso tsebe.
Then they saw where they were.	Eaba ba bona moo ba leng teng.
But in the end.	Empa qetellong.
I was with him.	Ke ne ke e-na le eena.
I suspect my son is starting to realize that, too.	Ke belaela hore mora oa ka o qala ho hlokomela seo, le eena.
Thank you this morning.	Ke leboha hoseng hona.
That didn't help much.	Seo ha sea ka sa thusa hakaalo.
You will do this first.	U tla etsa sena pele.
I don't know if it will work or not.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e ea sebetsa kapa che.
He was not hard to find.	O ne a se thata ho mo fumana.
They were afraid to go out.	Ba ne ba tšaba ho tsoa.
I want him to be there.	Ke batla hore a be teng.
Eventually he wanted to tell us everything.	Qetellong o ne a batla ho re bolella ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
But we do not.	Empa ha re etse joalo.
My name was.	Lebitso la ka e ne e le.
More than that with strong production.	Ho feta joalo ka tlhahiso e matla.
If all could live, people would see.	Haeba kaofela ba ka phela, batho ba tla bona.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
And he can't sleep.	'Me ha a khone ho robala.
I will do it.	Ke tla e etsa.
Give it a go.	Fana ka eona.
I work hard to achieve that now.	Ke sebetsa ka thata ho fihlela seo hona joale.
I opened the door.	Ke ile ka bula lemati.
We need to talk about them.	Re hloka ho bua ka tsona.
So there is nothing we can do.	Kahoo ha ho letho leo re ka le etsang.
You need to be able to tell them no.	U lokela ho khona ho ba bolella che.
I asked him where he was going.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na o ea hokae.
So that's what they did.	Kahoo ke seo ba se entseng.
His suggestion is strong.	Tlhahiso ea hae e matla.
We are both.	Ka bobeli re.
His real life.	Bophelo ba hae ba sebele.
You did that to me, son.	U entse joalo ho 'na, mora.
In the end, he did nothing.	Qetellong, ha aa ka a etsa letho.
It was easy from then on.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho tloha ka nako eo ho ea pele.
And mine, too.	Le ea ka, hape.
One of them is good for me.	E 'ngoe ea tsona e ntle le nna.
We have enough of that.	Re na le tse lekaneng tsa tseo.
And now our friends are better for us.	'Me joale metsoalle ea rona e molemo ho rona.
None of this is easy.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea eona e bonolo.
We all love them.	Kaofela rea ​​ba rata.
Nor to win.	Leha e le ho hlola.
Che! 	Che!
Ask others if you have any questions.	Botsa ba bang hore na ho na le seo u lokelang ho se botsa.
Of course we did not see him, but we heard him.	Ha e le hantle ha rea ​​ka ra mo bona, empa re ile ra mo utloa.
But it works well.	Empa e sebetsa hantle.
Here's the same.	Mona se tšoanang.
But the information we have is not good.	Empa litaba tseo re nang le tsona ha li ntle.
I'm really glad to see you.	Ruri ke thabetse ho o bona.
He wanted to know what it was.	O ne a batla ho tseba hore na ke eng.
The line was empty, and he was empty.	Mohala o ne o se na letho, le eena o ne a se na letho.
I had never seen it.	Ke ne ke eso e bone.
But that is the point.	Empa ke eona taba eo.
That was a very difficult decision.	Eo e ne e le qeto e boima haholo.
We have done a lot today.	Re entse tse ngata kajeno.
I'm too late again.	Ke morao haholo hape.
So keep thinking about it, talk to it about it.	Kahoo u lule u nahana ka eona, bua le uena ka eona.
We thought that was a good idea.	Re ne re nahana hore seo se setle.
Everything was one.	Lintho tsohle e ne e le ntho e le 'ngoe.
Now, there I am.	Jwale, ke nna eo.
He too refused to do so.	Le eena o ile a hana ho etsa joalo.
He felt good.	O ile a ikutloa hantle.
Obviously it does.	Ho hlakile hore hoa etsahala.
I watched him a lot that year.	Ke ile ka mo shebella haholo selemong seo.
But there are other times, too.	Empa ho na le linako tse ling hape.
The police also came, wanting to see his letter.	Mapolesa le 'ona a ile a tla, a batla ho bona lengolo la hae.
She had never heard of such a thing.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a utloa ka ntho e joalo.
There is a way to go.	Ho na le tsela ea ho tsamaea.
We could have done it, but he refused.	Re ka be re e entse, empa o ile a hana.
The most important thing.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
He believes this is important.	O lumela hore sena ke sa bohlokoa.
It will not be so easy.	Ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo hakaalo.
For me.	Bakeng sa ka.
Just do what you want.	Etsa feela seo u se batlang.
Someone made a mistake.	Ho na le motho ea entseng phoso.
And with that, you haven't done anything.	Mme ka seo, ha o so etse letho.
You could tell him exactly what you think.	U ne u ka mo bolella hantle seo u se nahanang.
It’s an amazing time to write.	Ke nako e makatsang ea ho ngola.
It was difficult to understand that.	Ho ne ho le thata ho utloisisa seo.
I did not wonder.	Ha kea ipotsa.
He was a good man.	E ne e le monna e motle.
Worse than that.	E mpe ho feta moo.
The same is true of most people.	Ho joalo le ka batho ba bangata.
That had done it.	Seo se ne se e entse.
In fact, that's where the issue lies.	Ha e le hantle, ke moo taba e leng teng.
Then nothing happened.	Eaba ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala.
Then we were in my place.	Joale re ne re le sebakeng sa ka.
We do not make this fun.	Ha re etse sena monate.
I love doing my job.	Ke rata ho etsa mosebetsi oa ka.
He realized that he had not slept.	O ile a hlokomela hore ha aa robala.
We do not talk.	Ha re bue.
You do not know what will happen.	Ha o tsebe se ka etsahalang.
Any mistake was not wrong.	Phoso leha e le efe e ne e se kotsi.
What kind of food do you like?	Ke mofuta ofe oa lijo tseo u li ratang?
Use that group for everything.	Sebelisa sehlopha seo ho tsohle.
I tried to stand up.	Ke ile ka leka ho ema ka maoto.
You wanted to go.	U ne u batla ho tsamaea.
I had such a wonderful time and I can’t wait until next year.	Ke bile le nako e monate joalo 'me ke sitoa ho ema ho fihlela selemong se tlang.
Yes, you have to keep going.	E, u tlameha ho tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
I forget what his name was.	Ke lebala hore na lebitso la hae e ne e le mang.
This is the last chance.	Ona ke monyetla oa ho qetela.
The man was gone.	Monna eo o ne a ile.
In addition, you need to provide your feedback on your letter.	Ho feta moo, o hloka ho fana ka maikutlo a hau ka lengolo la hau.
She is no better.	Ha a betere.
Love your style and your fun.	Rata mokhoa oa hau le monate oa hau.
Nobody here.	Haho motho mona.
I can no longer do that, though.	Ha ke sa khona ho etsa joalo, leha ho le joalo.
You do not want to know why someone did something.	Ha u batle ho tseba hore na ke hobane'ng ha motho a entse ntho e itseng.
He really did not know her at all.	Ruri o ne a sa mo tsebe ho hang.
We both know who we mean.	Ka bobeli rea tseba hore na re bolela mang.
Of course it is not something that should happen often.	Ehlile ha se ntho e lokelang ho etsahala hangata.
As you say.	Joalo ka ha u bolela.
Early in the morning	Ho sa le hoseng
However, he did.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a li etsa.
They look in space.	Ba sheba sebakeng.
And they knew where to go.	Mme ba ne ba tseba moo ba lokelang ho ya teng.
However, that is not the case at all.	Leha ho le joalo, ho hang ha ho joalo.
He did not look.	Ha a ka a sheba.
It took too long.	Ho ile ha nka nako e telele haholo.
Of course you do not.	Ha e le hantle ha u etse joalo.
You are still in danger.	O ntse o le kotsing.
They did not expect this.	Ba ne ba sa lebella sena.
Then do nothing.	Ebe o seke oa etsa letho.
He is a mild-tempered man who wants the best for himself.	Ke monna ea bonolo, ea batlang lintho tse bonolo haholo.
Everyone enjoys that.	E mong le e mong o thabela seo.
Or maybe someone will tell her that.	Kapa mohlomong motho e mong o tla mo bolella eona.
I refuse to be anything but myself.	Ke hana ho ba letho ntle le nna.
Mother was probably the last to know.	Mohlomong 'Mè e ne e le eena oa ho qetela ho tseba.
You just want to get to know them.	U batla ho ba tseba feela.
It seems obvious they have it.	Ho bonahala ho hlakile hore ba na le eona.
Until he is not.	Ho fihlela a se jwalo.
Tonight, he did not sleep.	Bosiung bona, ha aa ka a robala.
I think they did.	Ke nahana hore ba ile ba etsa joalo.
The iconic image fell old.	Setšoantšo sa setšoantšo se ile sa oa khale.
I want you to know that it is not you.	Ke batla hore u tsebe hore ha se uena.
That's how it happened.	Ke kamoo seo se etsahetseng kateng.
Like me.	Joalo ka 'na.
I do not .	Ha ke .
But, of course, anything was coming.	Empa, ha e le hantle, eng kapa eng e ne e tla.
I will look into this.	Ke tla sheba sena.
It is time to move on.	Ke nako ea ho tsoela pele.
I really enjoyed that.	Ke thabetse seo haholo.
Sadly, she is no longer with us.	Ka masoabi, ha a sa na rōna.
I looked at him.	Ke ile ka mo sheba.
Obviously not so today.	Ho hlakile hore ha ho joalo kajeno.
I certainly hope not.	Ka sebele ke tšepa hore ha ho joalo.
We spent all our time together.	Re ne re qeta nako e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe re le hammoho.
I would rather eat with one person than with several.	Nka mpa ka ja le motho a le mong ho e-na le ho ja ba 'maloa.
I wanted to.	Ke ne ke re batla.
They wanted to talk to me.	Ba ne ba batla ho bua le ’na.
I love that baby.	Ke rata ngoana eo.
But that was not the case.	Empa le eona e ne e se joalo.
I'm not so sure about the good stuff.	Ha ke na bonnete hakaalo ka ntho e ntle.
All, and nothing.	Tsohle, mme ha ho letho.
I had no idea how it would work here.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na e tla sebetsa joang mona.
What are we doing now? 	Re etsa’ng hona joale?
It is easy enough for a child.	Ho bonolo ho lekana bakeng sa ngoana.
he asked.	a botsa.
I did not get enough sleep.	Ha kea robala ka ho lekaneng.
This is important to understand the issue.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa ho utloisisa taba.
In fact, he was not alone.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a se mong.
Food is bad sometimes.	Lijo li mpe haholo ka linako tse ling.
I read his book.	Ke ile ka bala buka ea hae.
Of course, he did not know what this was.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a sa tsebe hore na sena ke eng.
Where are we going?	Re ea kae?
He tried not to think about it.	O ile a leka ho se nahane ka eona.
But it did not.	Empa ha ea ka ea etsa joalo.
The woman does.	Mosali o etsa joalo.
That's what the book said.	Ke seo buka e se buileng.
There is no such time.	Ha ho nako e joalo.
Thinking about him a lot.	Ho nahana ka eena haholo.
He had said nothing so far.	O ne a eso bue letho ho fihlela mona.
That's bad news.	Ke litaba tse mpe.
I can't reach such a conclusion.	Ha ke khone ho fihlela qeto e joalo.
He saw it, enjoyed it.	O ile a e bona, a e thabela.
What we want to see.	Seo re batlang ho se bona.
When we started, it was very early in the morning.	Ha re qala, e ne e le hoseng haholo.
He knew nothing about it.	O ne a sa tsebe letho ka eona.
It was not a pleasant feeling.	E ne e se maikutlo a monate.
We will meet in the morning.	Re tla kopana hoseng.
It is now clear that the police are continuing with their questions.	Joale ho hlakile hore mapolesa a tsoela pele ka lipotso tsa bona.
But he would return.	Empa o ne a tla khutla.
Of course, there is something for everyone.	Ha e le hantle, ho na le ho hong bakeng sa motho e mong le e mong.
But they will overcome it.	Empa ba tla e hlola.
If only there was something better.	Hoja feela ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ho molemo.
So where do you sleep tonight?	Joale u robala hokae bosiung bona?
It's close to home.	E haufi le hae.
He doesn't have to be that way.	Ha a tlameha ho ba jwalo.
That one stands.	Eo oa ema.
It could have been.	Ho ka be ho bile teng.
Simple but very fun.	E bonolo empa e monate haholo.
I'll have to go back there.	Ke tla tlameha ho khutlela moo.
You did well, though.	O entse hantle, leha ho le jwalo.
If there is, you can have it.	Haeba ho na le, u ka ba le eona.
We heard the baby crying.	Re ile ra utloa ngoana a lla.
I didn't say that today.	Ha ke ya bolela seo kajeno.
I was glad to see it.	Ke ile ka thabela ho e bona.
Of course, there is none.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho ba teng.
Think about it, and ask the question.	Nahana ka eona, ebe u botsa potso.
It is an easy task.	Ke mosebetsi o bonolo.
He should have known that something was wrong.	O ne a lokela ho tseba hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
Everyone was happy.	E mong le e mong o ne a thabile.
They were walking, and they looked tired and happy.	Ba ne ba tsamaea ka maoto, ’me ba bonahala ba khathetse ba bile ba thabile.
He even felt close to her.	O ne a bile a ikutloa a le haufi le eena.
The child could not stay here.	Ngoana o ne a sa khone ho lula mona.
So, you no longer see those things.	Kahoo, ha u sa bona lintho tseo.
News was there.	Litaba li ne li le teng.
We live here, too.	Re phela mona, le rona.
But more than that.	Empa ho feta moo.
So, yes, this can happen to anyone.	Kahoo, e, sena se ka etsahala ho mang kapa mang.
Get external feedback if needed.	Fumana maikutlo a ka ntle haeba ho hlokahala.
It's just our problem.	Ke bothata ba rona feela.
I was nothing to him.	Ke ne ke se letho ho eena.
They seemed to be friends.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ke metsoalle.
I do not say it.	Ha ke e bue.
My mother.	M'e oa ka.
I think there is some benefit to that.	Ke nahana hore ho na le molemo o itseng ho seo.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke tsebe hantle.
He liked to play with the children a lot.	O ne a rata ho bapala haholo le bana.
Probably everyone would start by saying the wrong thing about the other.	Mohlomong e mong le e mong o ne a tla qala ka ho bua se phoso ka e mong.
I'll give you this one.	Ke tla u fa ena.
Anyone can comment.	A mang kapa mang a ka fana ka tlhahiso.
He could have done all he could from now on.	O ne a ka etsa sohle seo a ka se khonang ho tloha joale ho ea pele.
I won't talk to you for a long time.	Ha ke sa tla bua nako e telele le lona.
He looked up at the scene.	A sheba sebakeng.
We both thought the same thing.	Ka bobeli re ne re nahana ntho e tšoanang.
He doesn't want to talk to me.	Ha a batle ho bua le nna.
He does not know what he is talking about.	Ha a tsebe seo a buang ka sona.
This works well.	Sena se sebetsa hantle.
This is what you should see.	Sena ke seo u lokelang ho se bona.
And he never was.	Mme ha ho mohla a kileng a ba teng.
He wanted to leave quickly.	O ne a batla ho tsamaea kapele.
I do not eat that.	Ha ke je seo.
He just gave you your life and all that He has.	O sa tsoa u fa bophelo ba hau le tsohle tseo a nang le tsona.
In fact, it may not work for many years.	Ha e le hantle, e ka 'na ea se ke ea sebetsa ka lilemo tse ngata.
Get out and do it.	Tloha 'me u e etse.
I did not even know him.	Ke ne ke bile ke sa mo tsebe.
Both are true.	Ka bobeli ke 'nete.
Very good, very good.	E ntle haholo, e ntle haholo.
I don't know you very well.	Ha ke eso o tsebe hantle.
I do not know.	Nke ke tsebe.
Which they would not do.	E leng seo ba neng ba ke ke ba se etsa.
However, we can never go back.	Leha ho le joalo, re ke ke ra hlola re khutlela morao.
Do not do foolish things.	O seke wa etsa ntho e hlokang kelello.
That was another difficult day at work.	Leo e ne e le letsatsi le leng le boima mosebetsing.
I know what you want and where it is.	Ke tseba seo o se batlang le moo e leng teng.
They are worth considering.	Li bohlokoa ho nahana ka tsona.
Maybe I haven't heard anything yet.	Mohlomong ha ke sa utloa letho.
And it worked.	Mme e ile ya sebetsa.
Since then.	Ho tloha ka nako eo.
They never went back to it.	Ha baa ka ba hlola ba khutlela ho eona.
He wanted everything to be fun.	O ne a batla hore ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe e be monate.
It has definitely been better than before.	Ka sebele e bile betere ho feta pele.
It was not her fault.	E ne e se molato wa hae.
I want to make sure.	Ke batla ho etsa bonnete.
I decided to give it up.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho e tlohela.
This is a great place to understand the mind.	Mona ke sebaka se ngata haholo sa ho utloisisa kelello.
That's the place you made it.	Ke sebaka seo u se entseng.
I could not understand what he was saying.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho utloisisa seo a se buang.
The child looked at him.	Ngoana a mo sheba.
But he had done well.	Empa o ne a entse hantle.
To him, a dangerous thing meant suffering.	Ho eena, ntho e kotsi e ne e bolela ho utloa bohloko.
You really need the exit status you already have.	Ha e le hantle u hloka boemo ba ho tsoa boo u seng u ntse u e-na le bona.
How effective is this ?.	See se sebetsa hakae?.
We are one mind.	Re mohopolo o le mong.
And it's not good.	Hape ha se hantle.
He knew it well.	O ne a e tseba hantle.
It was hard to keep up the conversation.	Ho ne ho le thata ho lula ke bua le eena.
It will be so.	Ho tla ba joalo.
We never spent time together.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra qeta nako re le hammoho.
I could have cried like him.	Nka be ke ile ka lla joaloka eena.
It just wasn't his.	Feela e ne e se ea hae.
They said nothing.	Ha ba ka ba bua letho.
This situation has been going on for a very long time.	Boemo bona bo nkile nako e telele haholo.
If you want.	Haeba u batla.
.	.
I just started trying sometime.	Ke sa tsoa qala ho leka ka nako e 'ngoe.
Well, you'll see.	Be, u tla bona.
The food was delicious.	Lijo li ne li le monate.
No one needed to do that.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a hloka ho etsa joalo.
Power has just begun to be such an issue.	Matla a sa tsoa qala ho ba taba e joalo.
The pain was excruciating!	Bohloko bo ne bo le matla!
Most people do a lot of stupid things.	Batho ba bangata ba etsa lintho tse ngata tse hlokang kelello.
He didn't want to talk to them now.	O ne a sa batle ho bua le bona hona jwale.
He told them about his day.	O ile a ba bolella ka letsatsi la hae.
It was fun during the day when we left.	Ho ne ho le monate nakong ea letsatsi ha re tloha.
Let's see what happened to him.	A re bone hore na ho ile ha etsahala’ng ka eena.
It says it will be the last time.	E re e tla be e le lekhetlo la ho qetela.
Make sure you use them carefully.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u li sebelisa ka hloko.
That goes for both.	Seo se ea ka bobeli.
I want you to be better than I am.	Ke batla hore o be betere ho mpheta.
And doing things.	Le ho etsa lintho.
Like the first one.	Joalo ka ea pele.
Did he start that? 	Na o ile a qala seo?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
She needs help.	O hloka thuso.
They wanted to go back home.	Ba ne ba batla ho khutlela hae.
Maybe he’ll be great again, maybe not.	Mohlomong o tla ba moholo hape, mohlomong ho se be joalo.
Because I can.	Hobane nka khona.
The team is tough.	Sehlopha se thata.
His way.	Tsela ea hae.
But the news is already there.	Empa litaba li se li ntse li le teng.
Some he knew, some.	Ba bang o ne a ba tseba, ba bang.
They know us very well.	Ba re tseba haholo.
That, too, is a very strange thing.	Seo, le sona, ke ntho e makatsang haholo.
I will start that too.	Le nna ke tla qala seo hape.
We both know who he means.	Ka bobeli rea tseba hore na o bolela mang.
You look at the problem.	U sheba bothata.
We did the same.	Le rōna re entse joalo.
It's me.	Ke 'na.
They could not decide what to do with you.	Ba ne ba sitoa ho etsa qeto ea hore na ba etse eng ka uena.
And every day you want these after that.	'Me letsatsi le letsatsi u batla tsena ka mor'a moo.
I just want to be sure.	Ke batla feela ho ba le bonnete.
I have a phone call to call when we get in.	Ke na le mohala oo ke lokelang ho o letsetsa ha re kena.
They said it was not a problem.	Ba itse ha se bothata.
They seem to be waiting for something.	Ba bonahala ba emetse ho hong.
According to what they say.	Ho ea kamoo ba buang kateng.
Think about it all with me.	Nahana ka eona kaofela le 'na.
To be honest with you, we are not sure how that could happen.	Ho bua 'nete ho uena, ha re na bonnete ba hore na seo se ka etsahala joang.
What's going on? 	Ho etsahalang?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
I'm not just saying this.	Ha ke bue sena feela.
He may not want it.	E ka 'na eaba ha a e batle.
Neither do I.	Le 'na ha ke etse joalo.
It is better to drink water than coffee.	Ho molemo ho noa metsi ho feta kofi.
I am a doctor.	Ke ngaka.
It is a way of life.	Ke mokhoa oa ho phela bophelo.
Decide that.	Etsa qeto ea hore.
This job looks great.	Mosebetsi ona o shebahala o le motle.
Three or more.	Tse tharo kapa ho feta.
Life seemed hard to him.	Bophelo bo ne bo bonahala bo le thata ho eena.
I'd like to try it on.	Ke kopa ho e leka.
I do not know how to fix this.	Ha ke tsebe mokhoa oa ho lokisa sena.
You will see in this.	O tla bona ho sena.
He was far ahead of his time.	O ne a le pele haholo ho nako ea hae.
The baby was happy.	Ngoana o ne a thabile.
Helping other people.	Ho thusa batho ba bang.
We love that.	Re rata seo.
Maybe the thought of this comes from me.	Mohlomong mohopolo oa sena o tsoa ho 'na.
It was three days before they were able to leave.	Ho ile ha feta matsatsi a mararo pele ba khona ho tsamaea.
People do not want to know him.	Batho ha ba batle ho mo tseba.
I look at them, my mind empty.	Kea ba sheba, kelello ea ka e se na letho.
Last question.	Potso ea ho qetela.
I was very early.	Ke ne ke le pele haholo.
And my strength is gone.	'Me matla a ka a feta.
He decided to stay.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho lula.
Yes, it is time.	E, ke nako.
Some may not.	Ba bang ba ka 'na ba se ke ba ba joalo.
It must be his.	E tlameha ebe ke ea hae.
I will say this though.	Ke tla bua sena leha ho le joalo.
I wish he could come.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka tla.
They probably would not stay.	Mohlomong ba ne ba ke ke ba lula.
They could do what they want now.	Ba ne ba ka etsa seo ba se ratang hona joale.
They have little to do with this idea.	Ha ba na taba haholo le mohopolo ona.
The accident was very serious.	Kotsi eo e ne e le bohloko haholo.
We may not get our time.	Re ka 'na ra se ke ra fumana nako ea rona.
But we did not think much of it.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra nahana hakaalo ka eona.
How do you do this?	O etsa see joang?
We did not have time to do anything for a long time.	Ha rea ​​ka ra fumana nako ea ho etsa letho ka nako e telele.
He could not admit to any wrongdoing.	O ne a ke ke a lumela phoso leha e le efe.
However, it is the saddest thing.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ntho e bohloko ka ho fetisisa.
I would love to.	Ke tla rata.
He has a chance without us.	O na le monyetla ntle le rona.
How long has he been dead?	E se e le nako e kae haesale a hlokahala?
It was a very nice place.	E ne e le sebaka se setle haholo.
For them, for us, for others.	Bakeng sa bona, bakeng sa rona, bakeng sa ba bang.
You work hard all the time.	U sebetsa ka thata ka linako tsohle.
We enjoyed it.	Re ile ra e thabela.
Consider the situation of passing.	Nahana ka boemo ba ho feta.
You can read it, if you like.	O ka e bala, ha o rata.
I'm sorry to say it's true.	Ke masoabi ho bolela hore ke 'nete.
This would not be fun.	Sena se ne se ke ke sa ba monate.
In fact, it works well and lasts a long time.	Ha e le hantle, e sebetsa hantle le ho nka nako e telele.
It looks good.	E shebahala e le ntho e ntle.
And it was very difficult for me.	Mme ho ne ho le boima haholo ho nna.
They just know this is it.	Ba tseba feela hore ena ke eona.
But we still had some.	Empa re ne re ntse re e-na le tse ling.
It is you who decides when and how much to drive.	Ke uena ea etsang qeto ea hore na u khanna neng hona hakae.
He loved to write his name.	O ne a rata ho ngola lebitso la hae.
I used to live in this area before.	Ke ne ke lula sebakeng sena pele.
Yes, of course, of course.	E, ho hlakile, ho hlakile.
I'm looking for an old one.	Ke batla ea khale morao.
Thanks for your help.	Ke leboha thuso ea hao.
He never thought he wanted to look at her so much.	Ho ne ho se mohla a kileng a nahana hore o batla ho mo sheba haholo.
You need to be aware of the danger.	O lokela ho hlokomela kotsi.
I can't do it tomorrow.	Ha ke khone hosane hantle.
For today, or.	Bakeng sa kajeno, kapa.
So much for food.	Haholo ka lijo.
But it is very difficult to do it.	Empa ho thata haholo ho e etsa.
Find out what you can do with yourself.	Fumana seo u ka se etsang le uena.
The child was not there.	Ngoana o ne a le sieo.
He begins to speak.	O qala ho bua.
Power was the reason for it.	Matla e ne e le lebaka la ona.
But this did not feel the same.	Empa sena ha sea ka sa ikutloa joalo.
Just to thank him.	Ho mo leboha feela.
They knew they were in danger.	Ba ne ba tseba hore ba kotsing.
Thank you for your time.	Ke leboha nako ea hau.
You are with him.	U na le eena.
That is, we cannot do anything without it.	Ke hore, re ke ke ra etsa se seng ntle le se seng.
Only, it was not.	Feela, ho ne ho se joalo.
A strong team.	Sehlopha se matla.
I will not go.	Nke ke ka ea.
They may have come from anywhere.	E ka 'na eaba ba tsoa kae kapa kae moo.
I knew that now.	Ke ne ke tseba seo jwale.
I will find him.	Ke tla mo fumana.
I looked good.	Ke ne ke shebahala hantle.
We feel like it could be.	Re ikutloa eka ho ka ba joalo.
He likes to write a lot, as you can see.	O rata ho ngola haholo, joalo ka ha u bona.
It is very important to me.	E bohlokoa haholo ho 'na.
So, our job is to move on.	Ka hona, mosebetsi oa rona ke ho tsoela pele.
I just want to continue with it.	Ke batla feela ho tsoela pele ka eona.
He just refused.	A hana feela.
I started thinking about work.	Ke ile ka qala ho nahana ka mosebetsi.
You can't learn something that way.	U ke ke ua ithuta ntho ka tsela eo.
If we can't give you what you want, we will tell you.	Haeba re sa khone ho u fa seo u se batlang, re tla u bolella.
I am with you here.	Ke na le uena mona.
He is always present.	O teng ka nako tsohle.
Of course, there is power.	Ha e le hantle, ho na le matla.
The children had to go to school.	Bana ba ne ba lokela ho kena sekolo.
He would have loved to hear them.	A ka be a ile a rata ho li utloa.
I don't like people.	Ha ke rate batho.
He could read, he quickly realized.	O ne a tseba ho bala, o ile a hlokomela kapele.
I can tell.	Nka khona ho bolela.
So he began to read.	Kahoo a qala ho bala.
If anyone is crying, he should ask what he wants.	Haeba mang kapa mang a lla, o lokela ho botsa seo a se batlang.
I think you can do it.	Ke nahana hore o ka e etsa.
That is why it will give you a mistake.	Ke ka lebaka leo e tla u fa phoso.
I have done well for others.	Ke entse hantle ho ba bang.
I was able to work.	Ke ile ka khona ho sebetsa.
Everyone agreed, but then something amazing happened.	E mong le e mong o ile a ba lumela, empa joale ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang.
Everything we did together.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo re e entseng hammoho.
As long as it exists.	Ha feela e ntse e le teng.
He has many things in common.	O na le lintho tse ngata tseo a tšoanang le tsona.
It usually does not hurt.	Hangata ha e na bohloko.
He arrives after thirty years.	O fihla ka mor'a lilemo tse mashome a mararo.
Everyone has a job to do.	E mong le e mong o na le mosebetsi oo a lokelang ho o etsa.
This is bad news.	Tsena ke litaba tse mpe.
You did this all the time last year.	U entse sena ka linako tsohle selemong se fetileng.
Today it is a place to buy shoes.	Kajeno ke sebaka sa ho reka lieta.
I know more.	Ke tseba ho feta.
Would you like this too?	Na le uena u ka rata see?.
People are looking forward to it.	Batho ba li lebeletse.
One is to see things as they really are.	E ’ngoe ke ho bona lintho kamoo li leng kateng.
I would not come to a man.	Ke ne nke ke ka tla ho monna.
I'm going to help her.	Ke ya mo thusa.
People want us.	Batho ba re batla.
But the water was really coming.	Empa metsi a ne a hlile a tla.
I have to wear it.	Ke tlameha ho e apara.
There was no one there.	Ho ne ho se na motho.
Eat somewhere.	Ja sebakeng se seng.
What will happen to you?	Ho tla etsahala'ng ka uena?
We provided assistance.	Re ile ra fana ka thuso.
Sit down again.	Lula hape.
It was so hard.	Ho ne ho le thata joalo.
I'm so glad to be here.	Ke thabile haholo ho ba mona.
I do not know what it says.	Ha ke tsebe seo e se buang.
Ask someone.	Kopa motho.
I will say yours.	Ke tla re hao.
I am sure you will be fine with that.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o tla phela hantle ka seo.
We have a chance.	Re na le monyetla.
I do nothing.	Ha ke etse letho.
When you ask questions.	Ha u botsa lipotso.
Worse than that.	E mpe ho feta moo.
I just graduated from high school.	Ke sa tsoa qeta sekolong se phahameng.
New.	E ncha.
To save, to save.	Ho boloka, ho boloka.
Think about your family.	Nahana ka lelapa la hao.
But that did not happen.	Empa ha hoa ka ha etsahala joalo.
I did not ask for anything from him.	Ha kea ka ka batla letho le leng ho eena.
They have both met with this group.	Ba kopane ka bobeli le sehlopha sena.
This is your place.	Sena ke sebaka sa hau.
He was going to inherit.	O ne a ilo lefa.
But it did not happen that way.	Empa ha ea ka ea etsahala ka tsela eo.
Moreover,	Ho feta moo,
It used to be all books.	E kile ea e-ba libuka tsohle.
It does not matter.	Ha se ea bohlokoa.
Don’t be afraid to start small.	U se ke ua tšaba ho qala hanyane.
It was painful at times.	Ho ne ho le bohloko ka linako tse ling.
I will help you fix the situation.	Ke tla u thusa ho lokisa boemo.
This may mean that some of you do not like to read.	Sena se ka bolela hore ba bang ba hau ha ba rate ho bala.
I'm here for you.	Ke mona bakeng sa hau.
I go into the room to get dressed.	Ke kena ka kamoreng ho ea apara.
And that still hurts a little bit.	Mme seo se ntse se le bohloko hanyane.
It is your decision to make.	Ke qeto ea hau eo u lokelang ho e etsa.
This weekend we had the opportunity to use them.	Qetellong ea beke ena re ile ra fumana monyetla oa ho li sebelisa.
It was his.	E ne e le oa hae.
But he did not know that.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe seo.
Very clear, though.	E hlakile haholo, leha ho le joalo.
I look forward to it.	Ke e lebeletse haholo.
Sometimes they felt more family to me than mine.	Ka linako tse ling ba ne ba ikutloa e le lelapa ho ’na ho feta la ka.
That was the first time for us.	Eo e bile lekhetlo la pele ho rona.
I feel like we were a real team, close friends.	Ke ikutloa hore re ne re le sehlopha sa sebele, re le metsoalle e haufi.
That's the question, isn't it?	Ke eona potso, na ha ho joalo?
Try to make good use of this.	Leka ho sebelisa sena hantle.
You want to see your entire space.	U batla ho bona sebaka sa hau kaofela.
No, that's my job.	Che, ke mosebetsi oa ka.
He was not eating his breakfast.	O ne a sa je lijo tsa hae tsa hoseng.
Life to live.	Bophelo ba ho phela.
I have never taken it.	Ha ke so e nke.
I have to go as far as I can.	Ke tlameha ho ea pele kamoo nka khonang.
We talked all the time.	Re ne re bua ka linako tsohle.
They all went to high school together.	Kaofela ba ile ba kena sekolo se phahameng hammoho.
That is not what makes it fun.	Seo ha se sona se etsang hore ho be monate.
But he did not want to think about it.	Empa o ne a se a sa batle ho nahana ka hona.
I was very busy.	Ke ne ke phathahane haholo.
They can be very fun.	Li ka ba monate haholo.
Not so with mine.	Ha ho joalo ka ea ka.
It reaches more than others.	E fihla ho tse ling ho feta tse ling.
You are where you want to be.	U moo u batlang ho ba teng.
Then he left.	Joale o ne a tsamaea.
Yes, it did.	Ee, e ile ea qala ho ba le mathata.
He had to live.	O ne a lokela ho phela.
That could be even faster.	Hoo ho ka ba kapele le ho feta.
We'll call you when we're done.	Re tla o letsetsa ha re qetile.
They were very good.	Li ne li le molemo haholo.
I do not want.	Ha ke batle.
Here we are again.	Ke rona bana hape.
Clothing is often emotional.	Hangata liaparo li na le bohlokoa ba maikutlo.
He has no sense.	Ha a na kelello.
He offered us water, but we refused.	O ile a re fa metsi, empa ra hana.
I do not understand why people cry so much.	Ha ke utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha batho ba lla hakana.
And if we do not, we should not.	'Me haeba re sa etse joalo, ha rea ​​lokela.
I stayed with the first one.	Ke ile ka lula le oa pele.
But it got even harder.	Empa ho ile ha e-ba thata le ho feta.
It worked, but you don't see it.	E ne e sebetsa, empa ha o e bone.
This helped a lot.	Sena se ile sa thusa haholo.
Just, though.	Feela, leha ho le joalo.
I really wish he would come back.	Ruri nka rata ha a ka khutla.
I give you a good job.	Ke u fa mosebetsi o motle.
But it is very difficult to read.	Empa ho thata haholo ho bala.
Finally he came close to her.	Qetellong a fihla haufi le eena.
That would be fine.	Hoo ho ka ba hantle.
The idea was at the party.	Maikutlo a ne a le moketeng.
People loved us.	Batho ba ne ba re rata.
He was very professional and enjoyed working with him.	E ne e le setsebi haholo 'me ho thabela ho sebetsa le eena.
He did everything well.	O entse tsohle hantle.
You don't have to do it, but you can't help it.	Ha ua lokela ho e etsa, empa u ke ke ua khona ho e thusa.
You never know what you might need.	Ha o tsebe seo o ka se hlokang.
It is very important.	E bohlokoa haholo.
I slept late at night.	Ke ile ka robala bosiu haholo.
You have certainly done this before.	Ka sebele u kile ua etsa sena pele.
Everyone was there.	Batho bohle ba ne ba le teng.
That's not fun.	Seo ha se monate.
We do not know what we did.	Ha re tsebe seo re se entseng.
It would be nice to see that.	Ho ka ba monate ho bona seo.
I think we will see some good ones out of this category.	Ke nahana hore re tla bona tse ling tse ntle ho tsoa sehlopheng sena.
It could not be.	E ne e ka se be teng.
I hope you find him.	Ke tšepa hore u tla mo fumana.
It really is the same thing.	Ha e le hantle ke ntho e le 'ngoe.
I feel that way.	Ke ikutloa joalo.
He needs your help.	O hloka thuso ea hau.
Then it is just another amount of money.	Ebe ke chelete e 'ngoe feela ha ho joalo.
I had no idea how important they were.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke tsa bohlokoa hakae.
I can start again.	Nka qala hape.
Try to find out what this wonderful thing is and say it.	Leka ho fumana hore na ntho ena e ntle ke efe 'me u e bue.
We said he was treated very well.	Re itse o tšoeroe hantle haholo.
In the head.	Ka hlooho.
You, or your parents, are not important.	Uena, kapa mohlomong batsoali ba hao, ha le ba bohlokoa.
He did not want to talk.	O ne a sa batle ho bua.
That was just the first thing.	Eo e ne e le ntho ea pele feela.
He finally finished.	Qetellong o ile a qeta.
The pleasure of being there.	Monate wa ho ba teng.
That long walk after dinner.	Ho tsamaea hoo e telele ka mor'a lijo tsa mantsiboea.
But the weight of the solar image is too heavy.	Empa boima ba setšoantšo sa letsatsi bo boima haholo.
However, it made me curious.	Leha ho le joalo, e ile ea etsa hore ke batle ho tseba.
And the fact that we did not say that there was nothing.	'Me taba ea hore ha rea ​​ka ra bolela hore ho ne ho se na letho.
We’ve probably had the best years there.	Mohlomong re bile le lilemo tse monate ka ho fetisisa moo.
We found things surprisingly simple.	Re fumane lintho tse bonolo ka mokhoa o makatsang.
I could not ask about another man.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho botsa ka monna e mong.
In that way each of us was treated three times.	Ka tsela eo e mong le e mong oa rōna o ile a mo tšoara ka makhetlo a mararo.
You, and I and others.	Le uena, le 'na le ba bang.
Then he tells her he is going home.	Joale o mo bolella hore o ea hae.
Please note this.	Ka kopo hlokomela sena.
Of course, everyone should do such things.	Ke ’nete hore bohle ba lokela ho etsa lintho tse joalo.
Otherwise, you will not be able to do that.	Ntle ho moo, o ka se khone ho etsa joalo.
You were from here.	U ne u tloha mona.
Some things are more important to him than money.	Lintho tse ling li bohlokoa haholo ho eena ho feta chelete.
I have to let others in.	Ke tlameha ho lumella ba bang ho kena.
There was no one around.	Ho ne ho se motho haufi.
We have a great place for it.	Re na le sebaka se setle bakeng sa eona.
Some days it was very painful.	Ka matsatsi a mang ho ne ho le bohloko haholo.
We would be.	Re ne re tla ba.
You will not need it.	U ke ke ua e hloka.
But it is not worth it.	Empa ha ea lokela.
He has no place for error.	Ha a na sebaka sa phoso.
I refuse.	Ke ya hana.
He just does not know what it is about.	O mpa a sa tsebe hore na e bua ka eng.
Your parents will surely do so.	Ka sebele batsoali ba hao ba tla etsa joalo.
Please, do not do that.	Ke kopa o seke oa etsa joalo.
Most kids seem to like this toy.	Ho bonahala bana ba bangata ba rata ntho ena ea ho bapala.
That was a terrible thing!	Eo e ne e le ntho e mpe haholo!
Some people are like that.	Batho ba bang ba joalo.
He was happy to take care of us.	O ne a thabela ho re hlokomela.
I did not want to pay for that.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho lefa seo.
Never try to do everything alone.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua leka ho etsa ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe u le mong.
However, most people do not like this.	Leha ho le joalo, batho ba bangata ha ba rate sena.
I am a difficult child.	Ke ngoana ea thata.
I always look forward to seeing him.	Ke lula ke lebeletse ho mo bona.
I have seen some of that in him.	Ke bone tse ling tsa seo ho eena.
If you do not know what those are.	Haeba u sa tsebe hore na tseo ke eng.
I want to be with my friends.	Ke batla ho ba le metsoalle ea ka.
This should be the only pain.	Sena e lokela ho ba sona feela bohloko.
That's a hard thing.	Ke ntho e thata eo.
He did not make a party.	Ha aa ka a etsa mokete.
I wanted him to do that.	Ke ne ke batla hore a etse joalo.
I would love to see your thoughts on them.	Ke rata ho bona maikutlo a hau ho bona.
He seemed to be somewhere else.	O ne a bonahala a le sebakeng se seng.
That too did not mean much.	Seo le sona se ne se sa bue hakaalo.
But don’t be too long.	Empa u se ke ua ba nako e telele.
The important thing is also when you do each job.	Ntho ea bohlokoa hape ke ha u etsa mosebetsi o mong le o mong.
He no longer likes to drive at night.	Ha a sa rata ho khanna bosiu.
However, it was even more dangerous.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le kotsi ho feta.
They are just fine.	Ba hantle feela.
Or rather, he was talking a lot.	Kapa ho e-na le hoo, o ne a bua haholo.
The boy was invisible.	Moshanyana o ne a sa bonahale.
It's a long way for me.	Ke tsela e telele ho nna.
Everyone seems to love each other.	E mong le e mong o bonahala a rata e mong.
You may or may not have.	Mohlomong u na le kapa ha u na.
No, you do not know anything about the difficult subject.	Che, ha u tsebe letho ka taba e thata.
You are a good girl and a good professional.	U ngoanana ea molemo le setsebi se hloahloa.
The man had done his job well.	Monna eo o ne a entse mosebetsi oa hae hantle.
I could not believe them.	Ke ne ke sa ba lumele.
Good or bad has its day.	E ntle kapa e mpe e na le letsatsi la eona.
Then there are such things.	Joale ho na le tse joalo.
You can get out of it for a very long time.	U ka tsoa ho eona nako e telele haholo.
He did not do so because he knew who he was.	Ha a ka a etsa joalo hobane a ne a tseba seo a leng sona.
Me and you, we can no longer sit down.	'Na le uena, ha re sa khona ho lula fatše.
I managed to get home, but I went to sleep.	Ke ile ka khona ho fihla hae, empa ke ile ka ea robala.
He would take care of everything.	O ne a tla hlokomela ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
Then no one would be there, it's as simple as that.	Joale ha ho na batho ba neng ba tla ba teng, ho bonolo joalo ka seo.
But that was exactly what they needed.	Empa e ne e le seo ba neng ba se hloka.
An empty house can be lonely.	Ntlo e se nang batho e ka ba bolutu.
Or go ahead.	Kapa tsoela pele.
I was a kid, at the time.	Ke ne ke le ngoana, ka nako eo.
My parents were very strict.	Batsoali ba ka ba ne ba le thata haholo.
You will have nothing.	U ke ke ua ba le letho.
Very fun to use.	E monate haholo ho e sebelisa.
I just thought he probably knew this dog.	Ke ne ke nahana feela hore mohlomong o tseba ntja ena.
The man is crying.	Monna oa lla.
Thank you very, very much.	Ke leboha haholo, haholo.
There is a truth for you.	Ho na le 'nete bakeng sa hau.
Life was good.	Bophelo bo ne bo le monate .
Some may even read the entire text.	Ba bang ba ka ba ba bala taba eo kaofela.
Don't be the first, no one loves the first woman.	Se be pele, ha ho motho ea ratang mosali oa pele.
Nor could he.	Leha e le hore o ne a ka se khone.
That's what a guy is.	Ke seo mohlankana a leng sona.
And then it didn't matter.	Mme ka nako eo ho ne ho se na taba.
My boyfriend knows, but it does.	Mohlankana oa ka oa tseba, empa ho joalo.
It's a house, of course.	Ke ntlo, ehlile.
And to continue.	Le ho tsoela pele.
I actually met him through his father.	Ka sebele ke ile ka kopana le eena ka ntate oa hae.
Good in their way, though.	E ntle ka tsela ea bona, leha ho le joalo.
Maybe in the future.	Mohlomong nakong e tlang.
He would like to ask you a few questions.	O rata ho u botsa lipotso tse 'maloa.
You start to wonder where you are going.	O qala o ipotsa hore na o ya kae.
I loved him as a player, too.	Ke ne ke mo rata joalo ka sebapali, hape.
Something is happening now, but we do not know what it is.	Ho na le ntho e etsahalang jwale, empa ha re tsebe hore na ke eng kapa kae.
And everyone will know what you did.	Mme bohle ba tla tseba seo o se entseng.
I can go in the morning, if you like.	Nka tsamaea hoseng, ha u rata.
Yes, that's exactly what happened.	E, ke hantle haholo se etsahetseng.
They never did with me.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba etsa le nna.
I was not sleeping very well.	Ke ne ke sa robala hantle hakaalo.
I am very happy with it.	Ke thabile haholo ka eona.
He was not very strong.	O ne a sena matla haholo.
There is no need for this.	Haho hlokahale sena.
Or they have been.	Kapa ba bile teng.
It seems to be the case, though.	Ho bonahala ho le joalo, leha ho le joalo.
I'm too late.	Ke morao haholo.
Well, we would have to come here.	Be, re ne re tla tlameha ho tla mona.
Yes, he will do just as well as anyone else.	Ee, o tla etsa hantle joalo ka e mong.
I stepped back quickly.	Ke ile ka khutlela morao kapele.
Finally, he opened it.	Qetellong, a a bula.
Do your homework!	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau oa sekolo!
They don't want that.	Ha ba batle seo.
With this kind of work.	Ka mosebetsi oa mofuta ona.
We don't have much time.	Ha re na nako e ngata.
This was very nice.	Sena se ne se le ntle haholo.
However, in the end it was very dangerous.	Leha ho le joalo, qetellong ho ne ho le kotsi haholo.
I'll have to read it again when it's clearer.	Ke tla tlameha ho e bala hape ha e hlakile haholoanyane.
It should not happen.	Ha ea lokela ho etsahala.
She wanted to keep the baby.	O ne a batla ho boloka ngoana.
He meant it.	O ne a e bolela.
He will not need her.	A ke ke a mo hloka.
He did well.	O entse hantle.
I do not need to see you but once a week.	Ha ho hlokahale hore ke u bone empa hang ka beke.
Stand by Me.	Ema le 'na.
I could not think of anything else.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
He had no idea.	O ne a se na maikutlo a letho.
They stand and stand.	Ba ema ebe baa ema.
Some of them knew things.	Ba bang ba bona ba ne ba tseba lintho.
Make a comment.	Etsa maikutlo.
We are sure you will find more.	Re na le bonnete ba hore o tla fumana tse ling.
I'm going to bed after that.	Ke il'o robala ka mor'a moo.
He is easy to take advantage of.	O bonolo ho nka monyetla ka eena.
Strong forces are also present.	Matla a thata le ona a teng.
Some of them tell the truth.	Tse ling tsa tsona li bua 'nete.
I just did the job.	Ke entse mosebetsi feela.
You know what's there.	U tseba se leng teng moo.
He had done the same thing the previous morning.	O ne a ile a etsa ntho e tšoanang hoseng ho fetileng.
Eventually they would leave.	Qetellong ba ne ba tla tsamaea.
I have been there.	Ke bile teng.
We do not need to tell him anything.	Ha ho hlokahale hore re mo bolelle letho.
People were walking instead of driving.	Batho ba ne ba tsamaea ka maoto ho e-na le ho khanna.
I know you want children.	Kea tseba hore u batla bana.
I really don't need them.	Ke hlile ha ke li hloke.
I would not do it.	Ke ne nke ke ka e etsa.
Some people live their whole lives	Batho ba bang ba phela bophelo bohle ba bona
That is a fact.	Ke eona 'nete.
This was very nice.	Sena se ne se le ntle haholo.
Although this fixes the problem.	Leha sena se lokisa bothata.
They leave.	Ba tsamaea.
I wondered what it would be like.	Ke ile ka nahana hore na ho tla ba joang.
People will tell me they are sorry.	Batho ba tla mpolella hore ba masoabi.
He did not need it since he died.	O ne a sa e hloke haesale a hlokahala.
They were better.	Ba ne ba le betere.
It is a long time coming.	Ke nako e telele e tlang.
Keep playing.	Tsoela pele ho bapala.
No one agreed.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a lumela.
He has no name.	Ha a na le lebitso.
But this situation exists at all no one.	Empa boemo bona ba litaba bo teng ho hang ha ho motho.
They did not need.	Ba ne ba sa hloke.
Things are going very well.	Lintho li ntse li tsamaea hantle haholo.
They often think only of themselves.	Hangata ba nahana ka bona feela.
It is really only a matter of time.	Ka sebele ke taba ea nako feela.
But we did.	Empa re ile ra e etsa.
Pain somewhere.	Bohloko kae kae.
These things are just.	Lintho tsena li mpa feela.
The same is true of many other people.	Ho joalo le ka batho ba bang ba bangata.
However, that is just my opinion.	Leha ho le joalo, eo ke maikutlo a ka feela.
It was a very dangerous time.	E ne e le nako e kotsi haholo.
We do not know when he will return.	Ha re tsebe hore na o tla khutla neng.
Dog life.	Bophelo ba ntja.
You get nothing at all.	Ha o fumane letho ka letho.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	U hloka feela ho li tšoara hantle.
I wish he could.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka khona.
He could not speak to us.	O ne a sa khone ho bua le rona.
Then he met the man.	Eaba o kopana le monna eo.
Simple, but beautiful.	E bonolo, empa e ntle.
This provides an amazing opportunity.	Sena se fana ka monyetla o makatsang.
But the fact is that some do think that it should.	Empa 'nete ke hore ba bang ba nahana hore e lokela.
He had never had a chance.	O ne a eso fumane monyetla.
There is something strange about the car.	Ho na le ntho e makatsang ka koloi.
I started writing about that.	Ke ile ka qala ho ngola ka seo.
We should do all we can to help the children.	Re lokela ho etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang ho thusa bana.
Some things just happened.	Lintho tse ling li sa tsoa etsahala.
They just loved it.	Ba ne ba e rata feela.
I know this for real now.	Ke tseba sena ka 'nete hona joale.
I think work has done him good.	Ke nahana hore mosebetsi o mo entse hantle.
I will have such fun.	Ke tla ba le monate o joalo.
This is the worst time ever.	Ena ke nako e mpe ka ho fetisisa.
I know you got one.	Kea tseba hore u fumane e le 'ngoe.
It happens every day now.	E etsahala letsatsi le letsatsi jwale.
I wonder what they did with it.	Kea ipotsa hore na ba entseng ka eona.
He wants to know you.	O batla ho u tseba.
I want to know who did this.	Ke batla ho tseba hore na ke mang ea entseng sena.
I could not get enough time each week.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho fumana nako e lekaneng beke le beke.
That didn't matter.	Seo e ne e se sa bohlokoa.
Everyone loves it.	E mong le e mong oa e rata.
It is as beautiful as it is.	E ntle kamoo e leng kateng.
That is not necessary.	Seo ha se hlokahale.
He was able to walk.	O ne a khona ho tsamaea.
He did not see her.	Ha aa ka a mo bona.
Hands meet.	Matsoho a kopana.
So what are you waiting for ?.	Joale u emetse eng?.
A job as good as yours.	Mosebetsi o motle joalo ka oa hau.
He asked himself that question.	O ile a ipotsa potso eo.
I do not say it will happen.	Ha ke re ho tla etsahala.
He knew he could not do that.	O ne a tseba hore a ke ke a etsa joalo.
Police arrested several people in the area.	Mapolesa a ile a tšoara batho ba ’maloa sebakeng seo.
My only question is.	Potso ea ka e le 'ngoe ke.
If he does, the team should be healthy.	Haeba a etsa joalo, sehlopha se lokela ho phela hantle.
He didn't think so much.	O ne a sa nahane hakaalo.
You have your driver's license.	U na le lengolo la hau la ho khanna.
We will catch them here.	Re tla li tšoara mona.
They have never done anything.	Ha ba eso etse letho.
It is up to you to decide if that will happen.	Ke ho uena ho bolela hore na e tla etsa joalo.
You will get home at any time.	U tla fihla hae ka nako leha e le efe.
He was always late.	O ne a dula a le morao ho nako.
She is not sure what she can think of.	Ha a na bonnete ba seo a ka se nahanang.
He already knew nothing.	O ne a se a sa tsebe letho.
That doesn't make sense.	Seo ha se etse kelello.
Clothing may be important but books were important.	Liaparo li ka ba tsa bohlokoa empa libuka li ne li le bohlokoa.
It said it would help us sit down.	E itse e tla re thusa ho lula fatše.
He has been thinking about these things for a long time.	Ke nako e telele a ntse a nahana lintho tsena.
And this will keep us together.	Mme sena se tla re boloka re le hammoho.
The book was useless.	Buka eo e ne e se na thuso.
They will certainly have to find it.	Ka sebele ba tla tlameha ho e fumana.
We said that was nothing.	Re itse seo hase letho.
He thought he probably had his place.	O ne a nahana hore mohlomong o na le sebaka sa hae.
And it is no longer necessary.	Hape ha ho sa hlokahala.
Unless they have what you are.	Ntle le haeba ba le seo o leng sona.
No, it wasn't me.	Che, e ne e se nna.
It was difficult and sometimes dangerous.	Ho ne ho le boima ’me ka linako tse ling ho le kotsi.
As long as it's not your fault, it's theirs.	Ha e sa le kotsi ea hau, ke ea bona.
He would arrive on time.	O ne a tla fihla ka nako.
There is an important question now.	Ho na le potso ea bohlokoa hona joale.
I refused to be.	Ke ile ka hana ho ba.
You will take care of her parents.	U tla hlokomela batsoali ba hae.
I know you have a job to do.	Kea tseba hore u na le mosebetsi oo u lokelang ho o etsa.
I took the children.	Ke nkile bana.
He did not care so much about his life.	O ne a sa tsotelle bophelo ba hae hakaalo.
But he was happy to take the money.	Empa o ne a thabetse ho nka chelete eo.
We must speak well of everything.	Re tlameha ho bua hantle ka ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
So, what happened next.	Joale, ho ile ha etsahala’ng ka mor’a moo.
However, one is better than standing.	Leha ho le joalo, e 'ngoe e molemo ho feta ho ema.
I'm still thinking the same thing you think.	Ke ntse ke nahana ntho e tšoanang le eo u e nahanang.
I can.	nka khona.
Everything we have, you will have too.	Sohle seo re nang le sona, le uena u tla ba le sona.
That would be the worst thing we could do.	Eo e ne e tla ba ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa eo re ka e etsang.
No one was injured.	Ba bang ha ho ba ileng ba tsoa kotsi.
We just realized we couldn’t.	Re ile ra hlokomela feela hore re ke ke ra khona.
Long time no see.	Ke khale ke sa u bone.
You start to do things.	U qala ho etsa lintho.
However no one noticed.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho motho ea ileng a hlokomela.
I have to have it.	Ke tlameha ho ba le eona.
I had never been there before.	Ke ne ke eso be teng pele.
Her father held her hands together behind her back.	Ntate oa hae a tšoara matsoho a hae hammoho ka morao.
You can read from here.	U ka bala ho tloha mona.
Have a nice day!	Eba le letsatsi le monate!
We will consider this.	Re tla nahana ka sena.
However, he thought it was still the night.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a nahana hore e ne e ntse e le bona bosiu boo.
We don't have many issues, but you probably don't have them either.	Ha re na litaba tse ngata, empa mohlomong le uena ha u na tsona.
They live in the background.	Ba phela ka morao.
This is a wonderful book.	Ena ke buka e monate.
That was the only way he could think of it.	Ke eona feela tsela eo a neng a ka nahana ka eona.
I wondered if he really believed that.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na o hlile o lumela seo.
I would say three hours.	Nka re lihora tse tharo.
Her children, too.	Bana ba hae, le bona.
You will just have to watch and see.	O tla tlameha feela ho shebella le ho bona.
He knew his stuff well because he recognized the problem very quickly.	O ne a tseba litaba tsa hae hantle hobane o ile a hlokomela bothata kapele haholo.
We should not just see bad things.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho bona lintho tse mpe feela.
Indeed, he was.	Ka sebele, o ne a le joalo.
I do not see anything.	Ha ke bone letho.
I am very happy to continue.	Ke thabile haholo ho tsoela pele.
You don't like that.	Ha o rate seo.
We must take care of it.	Re tlameha ho e hlokomela.
There was nothing to look forward to.	Ho ne ho se letho le neng le shebahala.
Finally, I finally get it.	Qetellong, qetellong kea e fumana.
There was no other reason after taking it.	Ho ne ho se lebaka le leng ka mor'a ho e nka.
Keep reading to see how well it works.	Tsoela pele ho bala ho bona hore na e sebetsa hantle hakae.
And he would do that.	Mme o ne a tla etsa jwalo.
Each has a specific function.	E 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le mosebetsi o itseng.
And he went in.	Mme a kena.
We were going.	Re ne re ea.
We need time.	Re hloka nako.
And he doesn't talk to me.	Mme ha a bue le nna.
People are well acquainted with it.	Batho ba e tloaetse hantle.
If there are times, it works well.	Haeba ho na le linako tse ling, e sebetsa hantle.
There is.	Ho na le.
I like news.	Ke rata litaba.
For, as, at the same time.	Bakeng sa, joalo ka, ka nako e tšoanang.
Or somewhere, but we get there.	Kapa sebakeng se seng, empa re fihla moo.
Think about other things from time to time.	Nahana ka lintho tse ling ka linako tse ling.
Open that again.	Bula seo hape.
It would never happen again.	E ne e ke ke ea hlola e etsahala.
I do not believe in all those things.	Ha ke lumele lintho tseo kaofela.
I could not eat.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho ja.
Only if you do not care.	Feela haeba u sa tsotelle.
It was not happening.	Ho ne ho sa etsahala.
He had no friends.	O ne a se na metsoalle.
People like us need to know that.	Batho ba kang rōna ba lokela ho tseba seo.
Lots of time.	Nako e ngata.
Decades, maybe.	Lilemo tse mashome a 'maloa, mohlomong.
He saw it.	O e bone.
I couldn’t drive with such a thing.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho khanna ka ntho e joalo.
It's not as hard as it looks.	Ha e thata joalo ka ha e shebahala.
I've seen it right.	Ke bone hantle.
We have to make money, people often forget that.	Re tlameha ho etsa chelete, hangata batho ba lebala seo.
We like to come in nice clothes and dress up.	Re rata ho tla ka liaparo tse monate le ho apara.
You must be very tired.	E tlameha ebe o khathetse haholo.
I'm at work a little bit.	Ke mosebetsing hanyane.
We understand this.	Re utloisisa sena.
Obviously they have it.	Ho hlakile hore ba na le eona.
Looking for him.	Ho mo batla.
I still belong to you.	Ke ntse ke le oa hau.
I understood that.	Ke ne ke utloisisa seo.
Not everyone can apply.	Ha se mang kapa mang ea ka etsang kopo.
My stomach hurts.	Mpa ea ka e bohloko.
Please make it your own.	Ke kopa u e etse ea hau.
Nothing in the past.	Ha ho letho le fetileng.
Take both now.	Nka bobeli hona joale.
I used to not get that.	Ke tloaetse ho se fumane tseo.
People did not seem to understand it at all.	Ho ne ho bonahala batho ba sa khone ho e utloisisa hantle.
Then he had to stop.	Eaba o tlameha ho ema.
I need you to do something.	Ke hloka hore u etse ho hong.
I'm still working there.	Ke ntse ke sebetsa teng.
Be aware of the danger.	Hlokomela kotsi.
We must not forget it.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho e lebala.
We both did it and really enjoyed it.	Re ile ra li etsa ka bobeli ’me ra li thabela haholo.
It was difficult to determine one's age.	Ho ne ho le thata ho tseba lilemo tsa motho.
I could not stand.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho ema.
This was exactly what he needed.	Sena e ne e le sona seo a neng a se hloka.
It was a beautiful place.	E ne e le sebaka se setle.
Or his to his home.	Kapa ea hae ho ea hae.
He always wanted to visit this place.	O ne a lula a lakatsa ho etela sebaka sena.
Thank you !!.	Ke a leboha!!.
He loves them.	O a ba rata.
One went, and the other.	E mong a ya, mme e mong.
I mean, it would be great.	Ke bolela, e tla ba ntle haholo.
His wife turned down the offer.	Mosali oa hae o ile a hana mosebetsi.
Let's see how you get out.	A re bone hore na u tsoa joang.
Go ahead and you will do well.	Tsoela pele 'me u tla sebetsa hantle.
Our team won.	Sehlopha sa rona se ile sa hlola.
And I'm happy.	Mme ke thabile.
You are wrong.	O na le phoso.
Nobody there, either.	Haho motho moo, le hona.
You know your room.	U tseba kamore ea hau.
It left there.	E ile ea tloha moo.
He never lived to give it away.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a phela ho fana ka eona.
Then, before you realize it, he would be home.	Joale, pele u hlokomela, o ne a tla be a le hae.
There is no one else like you.	Ha ho e mong ea tšoanang le uena.
What are you doing?	O etsa'ng?
I didn't want to tell her how good it was for her.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho mo bolella kamoo ho leng molemo kateng ho eena.
And maybe one.	Mme mohlomong o mong.
And nothing still has the same problems.	'Me ha ho letho le ntse le mathata a tšoanang.
There were more.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse ling hape.
No one had ever met them.	Ho ne ho se motho ea kileng a kopana le bona.
Here you are.	Ke mona le wena.
Thank you.	Kea u leboha.
I had a good idea.	Ke bile le mohopolo o motle.
Then you can talk to him about what you need.	Joale u ka bua le eena ka seo u se hlokang.
Everyone in the room knew what must have happened.	Bohle ka phaposing ba ne ba tseba hore na e tlameha ebe ho etsahetse’ng.
Maybe I'm just a mother.	Mohlomong ke mme feela.
Make sure you drink water before you start your diet.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u noa metsi pele u qala ka lijo tsa hau.
I hope you like them.	Ke tšepa u li rata.
The dog must sleep.	Ntja e tlameha ho robala.
And they have to understand the problems.	'Me ba tlameha ho utloisisa mathata.
Now, there is another way.	Joale, ho na le mokhoa o mong.
I am such an expert.	Ke setsebi se joalo.
Obviously he just wanted to get out of there.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a mpa a batla ho tsoa moo.
Sometimes things did not go well.	Ka linako tse ling lintho li ne li sa tsamaee hantle.
Mine is very simple.	Ea ka e bonolo haholo.
Date.	Letsatsi.
I figured out where to go.	Ke ile ka nahana hore na ke ee hokae.
Be the best '.	E-ba motho ea molemo ka ho fetisisa'.
I want to fix this soon.	Ke batla ho lokisa taba ena kapele.
I could not understand why.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho utloisisa lebaka.
So the boy came back before dinner.	Kahoo moshanyana a khutla pele ho lijo tsa mantsiboea.
I did a very good job.	Ke entse mosebetsi o motle haholo.
He was often absent.	O ne a le sieo hangata.
There may be some value there.	Ho ka ba le bohlokoa bo itseng moo.
Only you know.	Ke uena feela ea tsebang.
Life is Beautiful.	Bophelo bo monate.
We're going to hold the hands of those around us.	Re ea tšoara matsoho a ba haufi le rona.
This thing or thing is an idea.	Ntho ena kapa ntho eo ke mohopolo.
It's just a very dangerous place.	Ke sebaka se kotsi haholo feela.
Otherwise, an error will occur.	Ho seng joalo, phoso e tla etsahala.
But there are others who are there.	Empa ho na le ba bang ba teng moo.
Because we all have issues.	Hobane bohle re na le litaba tse teng.
I’m sure everyone goes through that every now and then.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore motho e mong le e mong o feta ho seo nako le nako.
But that has no chance out here.	Empa seo ha se na monyetla ka ntle mona.
We have a little bit.	Re na le hanyane le hanyane.
I'm new here.	Ke ncha mona.
This should not take long.	Sena ha sea lokela ho nka nako e telele.
I did not tell him anything.	Ha kea ka ka mo bolella letho.
As he did, and we had met several times.	Joalo ka ha a etsa joalo, 'me re ne re kopane makhetlo a 'maloa.
No, he thought.	Che, o ile a nahana.
The same is true of the law.	Ho joalo le ka molao.
Everyone to his own.	E mong le e mong ho ea hae.
Surprisingly, when you knew there was something wrong.	Ho makatsang, ha o ne o tseba hore ho na le phoso.
I heard him say that to me.	Ke ile ka mo utloa a bua joalo le ’na.
I wish you could have told me about it.	Ke lakatsa eka o ka be o ile oa mpolella ka taba ena.
You have to do this.	O lokela ho etsa sena.
That's the law.	Ke molao.
I could no longer look.	Ke ne ke se ke sa khone ho sheba.
They will never forget him.	Ba ke ke ba mo lebala.
They make no sense to me.	Ha li na kelello ho 'na.
He knew it was his fault.	O ne a tseba hore ke molato oa hae.
That was another one.	Eo e ne e le e 'ngoe.
It still works great.	E ntse e sebetsa haholo.
You don't need one of us.	Ha o hloke e mong wa rona.
That was clear enough.	Seo se ne se hlakile ho lekana.
And you will think about what you can do about it.	Mme o tla nahana ka seo o ka se etsang ka sena.
They loved to play with food.	Ba ne ba rata ho bapala ka lijo.
You know you're coming.	Ua tseba u tla.
I think we need to talk about this.	Ke nahana hore re hloka ho bua ka taba ena.
Find it there.	E fumane moo.
And indeed, it is even better.	'Me ka sebele ho joalo, ho molemo le ho feta.
You do the same.	Le uena u etsa joalo.
He looked around his room.	O ile a sheba kamore ea hae.
You wouldn't believe it without seeing it, man.	U ne u ke ke ua e lumela ntle le hore u e bone, monna.
Like a school thing.	Joalo ka ntho ea sekolo.
This is for both of you.	Sena ke sa lona bobeli.
But there was something even better.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ho molemo le ho feta.
Things looked good.	Lintho li ne li shebahala hantle.
He would not go out, nor would he eat.	O ne a sa tl'o tsoa, ​​leha e le ho ja.
You will consume us.	U tla re qeta.
But neither do we.	Empa le ho rōna ha ho bonahale eka re etsa joalo.
We do not eat food.	Ha re je lijo.
I will feel much better about myself.	Ke tla ikutloa ke le betere haholo ka 'na.
They are in the sun.	Ba ka letsatsi.
I do not know what I can get.	Ha ke tsebe hore na nka fumana eng.
I would fix this.	Ke ne ke tla lokisa sena.
It will never happen again.	E ke ke ea etsahala hape.
He did not know exactly why.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
I noticed something now.	Ke ile ka hlokomela ho hong hona joale.
But no one told them.	Empa ha ho motho ya ileng a ba bolella.
I took another one.	Ke ile ka nka e 'ngoe hape.
Obviously we are alone again.	Ho hlakile hore re le bang hape.
He did not tell them anything.	Ha a ka a ba bolella letho.
No, he was a human.	Che, e ne e le motho.
Those who are not there, they are mine.	Ba seng teng, ke ba ka.
I mean people.	Ke re batho.
Or both.	Kapa ka bobeli.
I need to go faster.	Ke hloka ho tsamaea kapele.
When we are done here we can use it all.	Ha re qetile mona re ka e sebelisa kaofela.
Her parents are also there.	Le batsoali ba hae ba teng.
He refused to eat his supper.	O ile a hana ho ja lijo tsa hae tsa mantsiboea.
I had a lot of fun times.	Ke bile le linako tse ngata tse monate.
He says we can use it.	O re re ka e sebelisa.
It never happened.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea etsahala.
In the past, they did.	Nakong e fetileng, ba ne ba etsa joalo.
You start to think.	U qala ho nahana.
Maybe he was not expecting it.	Mohlomong o ne a sa lebella.
It had some nice features.	E ne e e-na le lintho tse ntle.
I just visited.	Ke sa tsoa etela.
The team exceeded my expectations.	Sehlopha se ile sa feta seo ke neng ke se lebeletse.
Yes, thank you.	E, kea leboha .
The pain was excruciating.	Bohloko bo ne bo le monate.
That was necessary.	Seo se ne se hlokahala.
Again, they do.	Hape, ba etsa joalo.
I thanked her then.	Ke ile ka mo leboha ka nako eo.
It wasn't too heavy.	E ne e se boima haholo.
He was just too strong.	O ne a mpa a le matla haholo.
But we never heard of them.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra utloa letho ka bona.
He did not do so once.	Ha aa ka a etsa joalo hang.
Good work with space.	Mosebetsi o motle ka sebaka.
I hope we don't.	Ke tšepa re ke ke ra ba joalo.
It would be nice if you could do that, of course.	Ho ka ba monate ha o ka etsa joalo, ha e le hantle.
Very good money, it will probably stay there again.	Chelete e ntle haholo, mohlomong e tla lula moo hape.
We had nothing like this.	Re ne re se na ntho e kang ena.
The doctor asked her what she was eating.	Ngaka e ile ea mo botsa hore na o ja eng.
I need you to know something.	Ke hloka hore o tsebe ho hong.
Oh my, my girl.	O oa ka, ngoanana oa ka.
And now this.	Mme jwale sena.
His feelings were clear, but they were not real.	Maikutlo a hae a ne a hlakile, empa e ne e se ntho ea sebele.
It seems to be working well so far.	E bonahala e sebetsa hantle ho fihlela joale.
I never wanted it, you know.	Ha ke eso e batle, ua tseba.
I just want to go faster than they can.	Ke mpa ke batla ho tsamaea kapele ho feta kamoo ba ka khonang.
They play with other children who have similar feelings.	Ba bapala le bana ba bang ba nang le maikutlo a tšoanang.
We went to high school together.	Re ile ra kena sekolo se phahameng hammoho.
Then play it only when necessary.	Ebe u e bapala feela ha ho hlokahala.
Anyone you can talk to will be very wrong.	Mang kapa mang eo u ka buang le eena o tla be a re o na le phoso eo haholo.
They will get what they want to see.	Ba tla fumana seo ba ratang ho se bona.
However, they were good.	Leha ho le joalo, li ne li le molemo.
For, like, fun.	Bakeng sa, joalo ka, monate.
Maybe someone will find it useful.	Mohlomong motho e mong o tla e fumana e le molemo.
I'm done with everything behind me.	Ke qetile ka tsohle tse ka morao ho nna.
I don't see a problem.	Ha ke bone bothata.
But you did it.	Empa u e entse.
I'm not leaving now.	Ha ke tsamaee hona joale.
However, this is where things get more complicated.	Leha ho le joalo, mona ke moo lintho li bang thata haholoanyane.
Eventually it would have to offer something.	Qetellong ho ne ho tla lokela ho fana ka ntho e itseng.
He was not easy.	O ne a se bonolo.
It should not have done so either.	E ne e sa lokela ho etsa joalo le hona.
It will not be fun.	Ho ka se be monate.
He is here.	O teng ka mona.
This food is delicious.	Lijo tsena li monate.
He had enough money to return home.	O ne a e-na le chelete e lekaneng hore a ka khutlela hae.
How could we have been friends.	Mohlomong re ka be re bile metsoalle joang.
Someone is coming.	Ho tla tla motho.
You get the impression.	O fumana maikutlo.
Many did so very quickly.	Ba bangata ba ile ba etsa joalo kapele haholo.
I do not have my own house.	Ha ke na le ntlo ea ka.
Just to make money, such a book.	Ho etsa chelete feela, buka e joalo.
It was like I was working.	E ne eka ke sebetsa.
You decide to tell her about it.	U etsa qeto ea ho mo bolella ka tsona.
And then never do it again.	Mme ebe o seke wa hlola o etsa hore a etse seo.
He took his own life.	O ile a nka bophelo ba hae.
The fall was even more severe.	Ho oa ho ile ha e-ba boima le ho feta.
He does not know that there is a problem unless everyone tells him.	Ha a tsebe hore ho na le bothata ntle le hore bohle ba mo bolelle.
Sometimes this works better than sometimes.	Ka linako tse ling sena se sebetsa hantle ho feta ka linako tse ling.
I just had a delicious dinner here.	Ke sa tsoa ja lijo tsa mantsiboea tse monate mona.
One has to be careful.	Motho o lokela ho hlokomela.
I do this often.	Ke ntse ke etsa joalo hangata.
We both wore nice clothes and everyone knew Dad.	Ka bobeli re ne re apere liaparo tse ntle ’me bohle ba ne ba tseba Ntate.
I think you will enjoy it.	Ke nahana hore o tla e thabela.
He knows you.	O a o tseba.
Maybe we should try it.	Mohlomong re lokela ho e leka.
I never saw him again.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke mo bona hape.
That should be very helpful.	Seo se lokela ho thusa haholo.
He will not refuse me.	A ke ke a hana ho nna.
In fact, we asked everyone.	Ha e le hantle, re ile ra botsa motho e mong le e mong.
So many.	E ngata ruri.
Just leave.	Tloha feela.
They talk again.	Ba bua hape.
Eventually he started to feel better.	Qetellong e ile ea qala ho ikutloa e le betere.
It will definitely be better.	Ka sebele e tla ba molemo.
There was nothing.	Ho ne ho se letho.
Nor the fact that he was in real danger.	Leha e le hore taba ea hore o ne a le kotsing ea sebele.
He started.	O ile a qala.
It would have been a huge undertaking for him.	E ka be e bile mosebetsi o moholo ho eena.
There is nothing you can do.	Haho seo o ka se etsang.
I said one of us needs to do something.	Ke itse e mong oa rona o hloka ho etsa ho hong.
We will stop and see what happens next in his career.	Re tla ema 'me re bone hore na ho tla etsahala'ng ka mor'a moo mosebetsing oa hae.
No one deserves it.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang.
But he was certainly a single man.	Empa ka sebele e ne e le monna a le mong.
Otherwise there is no problem.	Ho seng joalo ha ho na bothata.
He didn’t care to stand for years.	O ne a sa tsotelle ho ema ka lilemo.
The girl looked tired and older than her age.	Ngoanana eo o ne a shebahala a khathetse a bile a le moholo ho feta lilemo tsa hae.
I mean never.	Ke bolela hore ha ho mohla.
I am not sure how I can achieve this.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore na nka fihlela sena joang.
Do it quickly.	E etse kapele.
He never felt better.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ikutloa hantle.
Each saw the other.	E mong le e mong o ile a bona e mong.
The reason is very simple.	Lebaka le bonolo haholo.
I loved it.	Ke ne ke e rata.
Work.	Mosebetsi.
Or maybe it was just me.	Kapa mohlomong e ne e le nna feela.
Now is your time.	Joale ke nako ea hau.
He could see that they knew about him and did not like him.	O ne a bona hore ba ne ba tseba ka eena ’me ba ne ba sa mo rate.
I can not speak.	Ha ke tsebe ho bua.
Do not think that this is impossible.	U se ke ua nahana hore e ke ke ea etsahala mona.
If we do not return in the morning, keep going.	Haeba re sa khutla hoseng, tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
Nobody can do it.	Ha ho motho ya ka o etsang.
The parents were delighted.	Batsoali ba ne ba thabile.
The pain is there.	Bohloko bo teng.
I do not know why.	Ha ke tsebe lebaka.
Let me do it.	E re ke e etse.
It was the first time.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele.
What happened tonight is happening.	Se etsahetseng bosiung bona sea etsahala.
He kept reading it and hearing what it was.	A 'na a e bala le ho utloa hore na e ne e le eng.
But he did not find anything.	Empa ha aa ka a fumana letho.
We have to do something, and fast!	Re tlameha ho etsa ho hong, le kapele!
He slept a lot that night.	O ile a robala haholo bosiung boo.
Anything or nothing and then everything again.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe kapa e se letho ebe ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe hape.
This is very new to me.	Sena se ncha haholo ho 'na.
It was as if they were trying on new shoes.	E ne eka ba leka lieta tse ncha.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	U tlameha feela ho etsa bonnete ba hore ha ho bonolo ho eena.
I find it hard to trust my boyfriend.	Ke fumana ho le thata ho tšepa mohlankana oa ka.
Koloi	Koloi
That's not very fun.	Seo ha se monate haholo.
We went out and found him.	Ra tsoa ra mo fumana.
Now this question.	Joale potso ena.
The same is true of any job.	Ho joalo le ka mosebetsi ofe kapa ofe.
Then stop.	Ebe u ema.
We can do it anywhere you want.	Re ka e etsa kae kapa kae moo u batlang.
So now they have to be tough.	Kahoo joale ba tlameha ho ba thata.
If it works for you, then stay with it.	Haeba e sebetsa ho uena, joale lula le eona.
He must have been desperate for her.	E tlameha ebe o ne a mo batla hakana.
I have no problem with them.	Ha ke na bothata le bona.
It has to be one or the other.	E tlameha ho ba e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe.
I never came back.	Ha kea ka ka khutla hape.
Of course no one will do this.	Ehlile ha ho motho ya tla etsa sena.
Bon Voyage!	Tsamaea hantle!
This is a very nice car.	Ena ke koloi e ntle haholo.
I have never had a dog.	Ha ke eso be le ntja.
I only had a moment in my life.	Ke ne ke e-na le nako feela ea bophelo ba ka.
They never make sense.	Ha ho mohla ba etsang kelello.
I knew he would do it.	Ke ne ke tseba hore o tla e etsa.
However, that does not seem to be the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho bonahale ho le joalo.
This was an opportunity to make amends.	Ona e ne e le monyetla oa ho lokisa boemo.
If you want to try, fine.	Haeba u batla ho leka, hantle.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso ka seo.
But there is something they want to tell us.	Empa ho na le seo ba batlang ho re bolella sona.
I no longer wanted to hear.	Ke ne ke se ke sa batle ho utloa.
It looks good.	E shebahala e le ntle.
They went into the bedroom.	Ba ile ba kena ka kamoreng ea ho robala.
Such a situation immediately.	Boemo bo joalo hang hang.
It's bad.	E mpe.
Their yes means yes, their yes means no.	Ee ea bona e bolela e, che ea bona e bolela che.
We have to talk about fun things.	Re tlameha ho bua ka lintho tse monate.
It will pass.	E tla feta.
He tries and thinks what he thinks.	O leka le ho nahana hore na o nahana eng.
I will look at it now.	Ke tla e sheba hona joale.
It was just one.	E ne e le 'ngoe feela.
But it was her fault.	Empa e ne e le phoso ya hae.
This is not true.	Taba ena ha se 'nete.
And he knows nothing now.	Mme ha a tsebe letho jwale.
People like to talk.	Batho ba rata ho bua.
The day is ahead of you.	Letsatsi le ka pele ho uena.
He asked her why she was leaving.	O ile a mo botsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha a tsamaea.
Can't come back next year?	Na ha u khone ho khutla selemong se tlang?
We don't care who you are or what you believe.	Ha re tsotelle hore na u mang kapa hore na u lumela eng.
It looked bad.	E ne e shebahala e le mpe.
Of course, too.	Ho hlakile, hape.
Thank you for your feedback.	Ke leboha maikutlo a hau.
I will never go beyond that again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke feta ho seo hape.
It still works.	E ntse e sebetsa.
She has been good.	O bile molemo.
What do you think of my new shoes?	U nahana'ng ka lieta tsa ka tse ncha?
Please try using our search method to find your content.	Ka kopo, leka ho sebelisa mokhoa oa rona oa ho batla ho fumana litaba tsa hau.
He could not read or write.	O ne a sa tsebe ho bala le ho ngola.
That's a hard thing.	Ke ntho e thata eo.
He was once such a young man, but that is no longer the case.	E ne e kile ea e-ba mohlankana ea joalo, empa ha ho sa le joalo.
Maybe my mind is not like that.	Mohlomong mohopolo oa ka ha o joalo.
Here is another task.	Mosebetsi o mong ke oo.
This is another way.	Ena ke mokhoa o mong.
He did not like to go alone.	O ne a sa rate ho tsamaea a le mong.
It was so beautiful.	E ne e le ntle haholo.
We want to know what they thought of them.	Re batla ho tseba hore na ba ne ba nahana eng ka bona.
In a few years.	Ha ho feta lilemo tse 'maloa.
If they just stop.	Haeba ba ema feela.
He told her to go for me.	O ile a re a tsamaee bakeng sa ka.
I understand you very well.	Kea u utloisisa haholo.
No money needed.	Ha ho hlokahale chelete.
I have been doing this for many years.	Ke na le lilemo tse ngata ke etsa sena.
Now he no longer cared what happened.	Joale o ne a se a sa tsotelle se etsahalang.
We were just talking.	Re ne re bua feela.
She cried when she talked to me about it.	O ne a lla ha a bua le 'na ka taba eo.
Which is fine with me.	E leng hantle le nna.
He could have gone out often to see her.	O ne a ka tsoa hangata ho ea mo bona.
My wife would not be able to live without him.	Mosali oa ka o ne a ke ke a khona ho phela ntle le eena.
He can fix it.	A ka o lokisa.
However, he wanted her to believe that.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a batla hore a lumele seo.
We should not talk about this.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho bua ka taba ena.
Your friends still need you.	Metsoalle ea hau e ntse e u hloka.
But it is not their job.	Empa ha se mosebetsi wa bona.
That is exactly what we are going to hear.	Ke hantle seo re tlang ho se utloa.
However, at one point he thought about it.	Leha ho le joalo, ka nako e 'ngoe o ile a nahana ka eona.
If he does.	Haeba a etsa joalo.
But sometimes.	Empa ka linako tse ling.
He just wanted a chance.	O ne a batla monyetla feela.
What it does to people.	Seo e se etsang ho batho.
I have to have them all.	Ke tlameha ho ba le tsona kaofela.
But she could not cry.	Empa o ne a sitoa ho lla.
I think you have a chance, yes.	Ke nahana hore o na le monyetla, ee.
But no one knows.	Empa ha ho motho ea mo tsebang.
She's beautiful, but tough.	O motle, empa o thata.
Without this, he would not be able to fear.	Ntle le sena, a ke ke a tseba ho tšaba.
I felt like it.	Ke ne ke ikutloa eka ke eng.
I love her very, very much.	Ke mo rata haholo, haholo.
The back was like a police car.	Ea ka morao e ne eka koloi ea mapolesa.
Somehow, they had it.	Ka tsela e itseng, ba ne ba e-na le eona.
It's a weird place.	Ke sebaka se makatsang.
But no one does it all.	Empa ha ho motho ea etsang tsohle.
It would be his last week.	E ne e tla ba beke ea hae ea ho qetela.
We enjoyed our stay and had a great time.	Re ile ra thabela ho lula ha rōna ’me ra ba le nako e monate.
Yes, it is not.	E, ha ho joalo.
I thought about the situation.	Ke ile ka nahana ka boemo.
It was weird at all.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang ho hang.
That makes us friends this week.	Seo se re etsetsa bekeng ena metsoalle.
They both knew that the news was passing.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba tseba hore litaba li ne li feta moo.
Hopefully no one else has it.	Re tšepa hore ha ho motho e mong ea nang le eona.
Find something else to do and come back.	Fumana ntho e 'ngoe eo u ka e etsang ebe u khutla.
Think it through.	E nahane hantle.
And of course, this.	'Me ehlile, le.
Yet they came.	Leha ho le joalo ba ile ba tla.
He just thinks it is the best.	O mpa a nahana hore ke eona e molemo ka ho fetisisa.
That's it.	Ke eona eo.
I wanted to meet as many people as possible.	Ke ne ke batla ho kopana le batho ba bangata kamoo nka khonang.
It can't leave.	Ha e khone ho tloha.
But we knew the water.	Empa re ne re tseba metsi.
To other children.	Ho bana ba bang.
Certainly not.	Ka sebele ha ho joalo.
A strange place.	Sebaka se makatsang.
I think this is what is coming.	Ke nahana hore sena ke se tlang.
That always applies to me.	Seo se sebetsa ho nna kamehla.
Eventually some people seem to start using it.	Qetellong ho bonahala batho ba bang ba qala ho e sebelisa.
We entered.	Ra kena.
Baby, you are what you are.	Ngoana, u seo u leng sona.
The man had another wife.	Monna o ne a e-na le mosali e mong.
Indeed, they go hand in hand.	Ka sebele, li tsamaea hammoho.
I did not do that.	Ha kea ka ka etsa joalo.
I can only do this more than anything.	Nka mpa ka etsa sena ho feta eng kapa eng.
I didn't start it, he didn't start it.	Ha kea e qala, ha a e qala.
When he returns, you will be able to plan how you will proceed.	Ha a khutla, u tla khona ho rera hore na u tla tsoela pele joang.
I hope it works well.	Ke tšepa hore o sebetsa hantle.
To be better now.	Ho ba betere hona joale.
And maybe even more.	'Me mohlomong le ho feta.
So you do not even know if this will work.	Kahoo ha u tsebe le hore na sena se tla sebetsa.
Go back enough.	Khutlela morao ho lekana.
None of them worked.	Ha ho le e ’ngoe ea tsona e ileng ea sebetsa.
He wondered what those things had done to you.	O ile a ipotsa hore na lintho tseo li u entse'ng.
And no one has ever been able to help their kind.	Mme ha ho le ea mong ea kileng a khona ho thusa ba mofuta oa bona.
Do not feel guilty.	U se ke ua ikutloa u le molato.
So they say.	Kahoo ba re.
Sometimes more.	Ka linako tse ling ho feta.
We know nothing about him.	Ha re tsebe letho ka eena.
We will be back soon.	Re tla khutla haufinyane.
Anything that would happen would happen here.	Eng kapa eng e neng e tla etsahala e ne e tla etsahala mona.
Too much driving.	Ho khanna haholo.
I almost liked him.	Ke ne ke batla ke mo thabetse.
That's my second issue.	Ke taba ea ka ea bobeli.
I could see he was home.	Ke ne ke bona hore o hae.
These books are not yours.	Libuka tsena hase tsa hao.
I think that's what it is.	Ke nahana hore ke seo e leng sona.
And there was none.	Mme ho ne ho se na.
It has been good to say that this is what happened.	Ho bile molemo ho bolela hore sena ke sona se etsahetseng.
I am happy today.	Ke thabile kajeno.
And there are many of them.	Mme ho na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
He asked the boy a question.	A botsa moshanyana potso.
I was doing other things.	Ke ne ke etsa lintho tse ling.
Fun in a family space that is close to everything.	E monate sebakeng sa lelapa se haufi le ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
That was fun.	Seo se ne se le monate.
I have my own house.	Ke na le ntlo ea ka.
My legs were heavy.	Maoto a ka a ne a le boima.
He told me he was tired.	O ile a mpolella hore o khathetse.
He loved everything.	O ne a rata ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
I hope that is about to happen.	Eka seo se se se tla etsahala.
And he knew about me.	Mme o ne a tseba tsa ka.
Your hair looks beautiful today.	Moriri oa hau o shebahala o le motle kajeno.
There is nothing for us there.	Ha ho letho bakeng sa rona moo.
We were very close.	Re ne re le haufi haholo.
This is not his style.	Sena ha se mokhoa oa hae.
I've seen it.	Ke e bone.
He usually has to stay home.	Hangata o tlameha ho lula hae.
As if none of it is real.	Joalo ka ha ho le e 'ngoe ea eona ea sebele.
However, it is clearly not that easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ho hlakile hore ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
Apply for this job.	Etsa kopo ea mosebetsi ona.
Things would be great.	Lintho li ne li tla ba monate.
I'm sorry, though.	Ke masoabi, empa .
I'm glad to do it so much.	Ke thabetse ho e etsa haholo.
They know we are here.	Baa tseba hore re teng.
So it can't be in that. 	Kahoo e ke ke ea ba ho seo. 
do not overdo it.	u se ke ua etsahala ka ho qetela.
There is no way out.	Haho tsela ea ho tsoa.
Get out, get out.	Tsoa, tsoa.
I'm working on it.	Ke ntse ke e sebetsa.
I did not know it as a child.	Ke ne ke sa e tsebe ke sa le ngoana.
He was not asleep.	O ne a sa robala.
But, that will not be enough.	Empa, hoo ho ke ke ha lekana.
Life came to a standstill for them.	Bophelo bo ile ba ema bakeng sa bona.
He is talking.	O ntse a bua.
He wanted me to stay.	O ne a batla hore ke lule.
He had a job, but he wanted a better life.	O ne a sebetsa e le mosebetsi, empa a batla bophelo bo betere.
This seemed very important to her.	Sena se ne se bonahala se le bohlokoa haholo ho eena.
Just use the head instead of your money.	Sebelisa hlooho feela ho e-na le chelete ea hau.
Do not play with him.	U se ke ua bapala le eena.
It was just what they needed.	E ne e le seo ba neng ba se hloka.
I just wanted to get out of there.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho tsoa moo.
I think this is the reason.	Ke nahana hore sena ke lebaka.
You don't care about these people.	Ha o tsotelle batho bana.
They wanted it.	Ba ne ba e batla.
From time to time a person may visit.	Nako le nako motho a ka 'na a etela.
He enjoyed it too.	Le eena o ne a li thabela.
It is very clear.	E hlakile haholo.
It's a good idea if you like it.	Ke mohopolo o motle haeba o e rata.
That's right.	Ke 'nete.
Get away from that dog.	Tloha ho ntja eo.
It can be difficult or almost difficult to survive.	Ho ka ba thata kapa ho batla ho le thata ho phela.
I've been here.	Ke bile mona.
I take that.	Ke nka eo.
No one knew where they were.	Ho ne ho se motho ea tsebang hore na ba hokae.
It was hard to find time to spend with friends.	Ho ne ho le thata ho fumana nako ea ho qeta le metsoalle.
In the last place there is no place to stand.	Sebakeng sa ho qetela ha ho na sebaka sa ho ema.
This works well.	Sena se sebetsa hantle.
We do not need much.	Ha re hloke tse ngata.
And somehow they could not find a way to start over.	'Me ka tsela e itseng ba ne ba sa fumane mokhoa oa ho qala hape.
Now is our time again.	Joale ke nako ea rona hape.
I played with him.	Ke ile ka bapala le eena.
Get it, get it, get it!	E fumane, e fumane, e fumane!
I think we did.	Ke nahana hore re entse joalo.
He found them first.	O ba fumane pele.
One of many such.	E 'ngoe ho tse ngata tse joalo.
Yes to all that.	Ee ho tseo tsohle.
So we knew nothing about them.	Kahoo re ne re sa tsebe letho ka bona.
There seemed to be no reason for that.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na lebaka la seo.
Maybe we should go.	Mohlomong re lokela ho tsamaea.
It seems like everyone.	Ho bonahala eka bohle.
Maybe they don’t know what your day is like.	Mohlomong ha ba tsebe hore na letsatsi la hau le joang.
You should have finished your work by now.	O ne o lokela hore ebe o qetile mosebetsi wa hao hona jwale.
Now, you told us, it's time to talk.	Jwale, o re boleletse, ke nako ya ho bua.
Trying to save money.	Ho leka ho boloka chelete.
Lots here.	Tse ngata mona.
So you can see what happens.	Kahoo u ka bona se etsahalang.
We have to assume you have seen them.	Re tlameha ho nka hore o ba bone.
And this is exactly the problem.	'Me sena ke sona hantle bothata.
However, they clearly did not.	Leha ho le joalo, ho hlakile hore ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
That's a simple fact.	Ke ’nete e bonolo.
Because often this is exactly the same.	Hobane hangata sena ke se tšoanang hantle.
And he knew.	Mme o ne a tseba.
But no, that is not the case.	Empa che, ha ho joalo.
He refused to talk to us.	O ile a hana ho bua le rōna.
I know it goes enough.	Kea tseba hore e ea lekana.
I would love to be with him.	Nka thabela ho ba le eena.
It would take time.	Ho ne ho tla nka nako.
It is easy to read a good book.	Ho bonolo ho bala buka e ntle.
Then the mood returned.	Eaba maikutlo a khutla.
However, the decision is his.	Leha ho le joalo, qeto ke ea hae.
I want to cry too.	Le 'na ke batla ho lla.
I don't know why, exactly.	Ha ke tsebe lebaka, hantle.
He left as a doctor.	O ile a tloha e le ngaka.
There was no other chance.	Ho ne ho se na monyetla o mong.
I doubt it would be better.	Ke belaela hore ho ka ba molemo.
The children were finally home.	Qetellong bana ba ne ba le hae.
I hope to use them again.	Ke tšepa ho li sebelisa hape.
It used to be someone else.	E kile ea e-ba motho e mong.
I just wanted to get back to it.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho khutlela ho eona.
It seemed like the team was taking too long.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka sehlopha se nka nako e telele.
It was the same with everyone else.	Ho bile joalo le ka ba bang kaofela.
Look, here's another one.	Sheba, ke ena ho e 'ngoe.
Well, sometimes.	Hantle, ka linako tse ling.
I better not go.	Ho molemo hore ke se ke ka ea.
The first week went well.	Beke ea pele e ile ea tsamaea hantle.
But he has a problem.	Empa o na le bothata.
No, it was not.	Che, ho ne ho le joalo.
It was so much better.	Ho ne ho le betere haholo.
Because he did.	Hobane o ile a etsa joalo.
None of these things are bad in any way.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea lintho tsena eo e leng lintho tse mpe ka tsela leha e le efe.
However, he was tired.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a khathetse.
It's really fun.	E monate ruri.
My father is not with her.	Ntate ha a eo ho eena.
Eventually, they found all those items.	Qetellong, ba ile ba fumana lintho tseo kaofela.
If there is only one thing, you do not have to do anything.	Ha ho na le ntho e le 'ngoe feela, ha ho hlokahale hore u etse letho.
He had to love them.	O ile a tlameha ho ba rata.
It is clear enough.	E hlakile ka ho lekaneng.
The first will not.	Ea pele e ke ke.
I was not sure what he was doing.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na o etsa eng.
He was often able to do that.	Hangata o ne a khona ho etsa joalo.
Maybe it was better this way.	Mohlomong ho ne ho le betere ka tsela ena.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
Maybe once he did.	Mohlomong ka nako e ’ngoe o ile a etsa joalo.
When she is beautiful, she is very beautiful.	Ha a le motle, o hantle haholo.
Or maybe they have already asked the dog.	Kapa mohlomong ba se ba kile ba botsa ntja.
Yes, that's really strange.	E, ehlile ke ntho e makatsang.
Just starting home for you.	Feela ho qala hae bakeng sa hao.
We have a lot in common.	Re na le lintho tse ngata tse tšoanang.
He cared for his father.	O ile a hlokomela ntate oa hae.
I do not know where he is.	Ha ke tsebe moo a leng teng.
There is no other way.	Ha ho na mokhoa o mong.
Refusal to do.	Ho hana ho etsa.
That is what we need.	Ke seo re se hlokang.
But do not really try.	Empa u se ke ua e leka ka 'nete.
The car was not important then.	Koloi e ne e se ea bohlokoa joale.
Now it's up to you and me.	Hona joale ke taba ea ka le uena.
We will tell you about them at the end.	Re tla o bolella tsona qetellong.
But there was something wrong.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le ho hong ho phoso.
We talked to him about it.	Re ile ra bua le eena ka taba eo.
He likes my coffee.	O rata kofi ea ka.
We hope you enjoy staying with us.	Re tšepa hore u tla thabela ho lula le rona.
It has to be there.	E tlameha ho ba teng.
He was coming.	O ne a tla.
You have enough.	U na le ho lekaneng.
To fix it.	Ho ea e lokisa.
Absolutely.	Ruri.
I'm checking out.	Kea tsoa.
You may be talking about an emotional life.	E ka 'na eaba u bua ka bophelo bo nang le maikutlo.
But he did not go.	Empa ha aa tsamaea.
It has no name.	Ha e na lebitso.
Secondly, it was me on a fun hair day.	Taba ea bobeli, e ne e le 'na ka letsatsi le monate la moriri.
Someone was always with him in the room.	Motho e mong o ne a lula a e-na le eena ka kamoreng.
I like danger.	Ke rata kotsi.
He was strong.	O ne a le matla.
Such a great man.	Monna e moholo joalo.
He seemed to see everything.	O ne a bonahala a bona tsohle.
Work with me for every moment of our lives.	Sebetsa le 'na ka nako e' ngoe le e 'ngoe ea bophelo ba rona.
We have to go tonight.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea bosiung bona.
It will take time to get there.	Ho tla nka nako ho fihla moo.
I am a doctor here.	Ke ngaka mona.
That's just the mind.	Seo ke kelello feela.
It would be her husband.	E ne e tla ba monna oa hae.
I did not ask him.	Ha kea ka ka mo botsa.
Anyway, later that night.	Leha ho le joalo, morao bosiung boo.
Eventually it would be someone else.	Qetellong e ne e tla ba motho e mong.
His father was away for a long time.	Ntate oa hae o ne a le sieo nako e telele.
I have no news about him.	Ha ke na litaba ka eena.
We don't really think about them.	Ha re hlile ha re nahane ka bona.
I can't sleep.	Ke sitoa ho robala.
Mention a time when you had to be strong.	Bolela nako eo ka eona u neng u tlameha ho ba matla.
She was not sure if she wanted a job or not.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na a batle mosebetsi kapa che.
They do not go anywhere.	Ha ba ee kae kapa kae.
Sometimes it is true and sometimes it is.	Ka linako tse ling ke 'nete 'me ka linako tse ling.
It happens, of course.	Hoa etsahala, ka sebele.
Everyone wants to know about it.	E mong le e mong o batla ho tseba ka eona.
He could not be arrested.	O ne a ke ke a tšoaroa.
Someone there would like to talk to you.	Ho na le motho moo ea ka ratang ho bua le uena.
I began to wonder what he was thinking.	Ke ile ka qala ho ipotsa hore na ebe o ntse a nahana ka eng.
He feels it strongly.	O e utloa ka matla.
But this may not be enough.	Empa sena se ka 'na sa se ke sa lekana.
Then just go to work.	Ebe u ea mosebetsing feela.
That worked well.	Seo se ile sa sebetsa hantle.
Maybe we had it.	Mohlomong re bile le eona.
This is just a bedroom.	Ena ke kamore ea ho robala feela.
She seems to know him.	Ho bonahala eka oa mo tseba.
He looked at the boy.	A sheba moshanyana eo.
The group in front of them.	Sehlopha ka pele ho bona.
No one had anything to say.	Ho ne ho se motho ya nang le seo a ka se buang.
I know he knew.	Kea tseba hore o ne a tseba.
He did not finish the call.	Ha a ka a qeta mohala.
They lived there for the rest of their lives.	Ba ile ba lula moo bophelo bohle ba bona.
There was no time for that.	Ho ne ho se nako ya seo.
I have a job, kind of.	Ke na le mosebetsi, mofuta.
Yes, of course, very good.	E, ehlile, e ntle haholo.
I will never forget that week.	Ha ke sa tla lebala beke eo.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
I knew what it was.	Ke ne ke tseba hore na ke eng.
Yet many did.	Leha ho le joalo ba bangata ba ile ba etsa joalo.
Now we do not know.	Hona joale ha re sa tseba.
Just forget about it.	Feela lebala ka eona.
I know that well enough.	Ke tseba seo hantle ho lekana.
Please write your name here.	Ka kopo ngola lebitso la hau mona.
If you can help.	Ha o ka thusa.
He looked at the end.	O ile a sheba qetellong.
He was doing it to make money.	O ne a e etsa ho etsa chelete.
Want to see how it goes?	U batla ho bona hore na ho joang?
This is indeed a very difficult task.	Ruri ona ke mosebetsi o boima haholo.
His family may come soon.	Ba hae ba ka 'na ba tla kapele.
That meant only one thing.	Seo se ne se bolela ntho e le 'ngoe feela.
That is a real problem right now.	Ke bothata ba sebele hona joale.
That's the group.	Ke sehlopha seo.
My whole family.	Lelapa la ka kaofela.
I can give him his place.	Nka mo fa sebaka sa hae.
There must have been more.	Ho ne ho lokela hore ebe ho bile le ho feta.
We really had both.	Re ne re hlile re e-na le eona ka bobeli.
We will not stand.	Ha re na ho ema.
No one had ever seen him.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a mo bona.
That has been his practice ever since.	Eo esale e le mokhoa oa hae ho tloha ka nako eo.
We should not do this.	Ha rea ​​lokela ho etsa sena.
It was clear he was tired.	Ho ne ho hlakile hore o ne a khathetse.
He really did it for his family.	O ne a hlile a e etsetsa lelapa la hae.
But I do not say, I do not say.	Empa ha ke re, ha ke re.
I can take it.	Nka e nka.
Or maybe there was something wrong with it.	Kapa mohlomong ho ne ho e-na le ntho e itseng.
They seem to be.	Ba bonahala ba le joalo.
And, of course, it will be needed.	'Me, ha e le hantle, ho tla hlokahala.
It takes, of course, that you are looking for us.	Ho nka, ehlile, le ntse le re batla.
We can do something about it.	Re ka etsa ho hong ka eona.
And sometimes it’s individual.	'Me ka linako tse ling ke motho ka mong.
One of his.	E mong oa hae.
This seems to be the case.	Sena se bonahala e le 'nete ea sebele.
I do not fully understand how something like this could happen.	Ha ke utloisise hantle hore na ntho e kang ena e ne e tla etsahala joang.
This is not fun.	Sena ha se monate.
None of them stood or stood.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea ileng a ema kapa a ema.
You may feel better, but life will go on.	U ka ikutloa u le betere, empa bophelo bo tla tsoela pele.
They should take that opportunity.	Ba lokela ho nka monyetla oo.
I do not know, I do not want to know.	Ha ke tsebe, ha ke batle ho tseba.
And no one else.	'Me ha ho le ea mong.
I'm right about this.	Ke hantle ka sena.
We did a lot of good things.	Re ne re etsa lintho tse ngata tse ntle.
He could not walk.	O ne a sa khone ho tsamaea.
The police have it.	Mapolesa a na le eona.
This place had a special significance.	Sebaka sena se ne se e-na le bohlokoa ba bohlokoa.
I had nothing of that.	Ke ne ke sena letho la seo.
While waiting for her, she opened her phone.	Ha a ntse a mo emetse, a bula mohala oa hae.
I will go and visit him when he feels better.	Ke tla ea ho mo etela ha a ikutloa a le betere.
This is nothing new.	Sena ha se ntho e ncha.
Talk to your doctor if you have any questions.	Bua le ngaka ea hau haeba u e-na le lipotso.
I never thought of it.	Ke ne ke sa e nahane.
There is no reason for them to do so.	Ha ho na lebaka la hore ba etse joalo.
It's too close.	E haufi haholo.
They come in.	Ba kena.
He says he will not go.	O re a ke ke a ea.
I just knew it was going to happen one day.	Ke ne ke tseba feela hore ho tla etsahala ka letsatsi le leng.
That is.	E leng hore.
It was the first time I had seen him.	Ke ne ke qala ho mo bona.
That is hard work.	Oo ke mosebetsi o boima.
I would like to meet someone who feels the same way.	Ke kopa ho kopana le motho ea nang le maikutlo a tšoanang.
Come home with me.	Tlo hae le nna.
Thanks for being a mom.	Ke leboha ho ba mme.
Or anyone, for that matter.	Kapa mang kapa mang, bakeng sa taba eo.
What do you think we can do?	U nahana hore re ka etsa’ng?
As long as it swims, it can stay alive.	Ha feela e ntse e sesa, e ka dula e phela.
And your parents.	Le batsoali ba hao .
I use it a lot.	Ke e sebelisa haholo.
However, we found out that this was not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, re ile ra fumana hore ho ne ho se joalo.
So true.	Ke 'nete haholo.
Her hair was wet.	Moriri oa hae o ne o le metsi.
Sometimes it was hard.	Ka linako tse ling ho ne ho le boima.
Then we will start now.	Joale re tla qala hona joale.
It is not for us to decide this question.	Ha se taba ea rona ho etsa qeto ea potso ena.
Of course you can.	Ka sebele u ka khona.
This may be a good thing or not.	Sena se ka 'na sa e-ba ntho e ntle kapa che.
He didn't come in.	O ne a sa kena.
It's weird.	Ke ntho tse makatsang.
He would not be there.	O ne a sa tlo ba teng.
I know you will write as soon as you can.	Kea tseba u tla ngola kapele kamoo u ka khonang.
I'm leaving fast.	Ke tsamaea kapele.
How long can you live without water?	U ka phela nako e kae u se na metsi?
I hope everything will work out for you.	Ke tšepa hore tsohle li tla u tsoela molemo.
He probably had taken the rest home.	Mohlomong o ne a nkile tse ling kaofela hae.
Because you.	Hobane u.
And to think of him more.	Le ho nahana ka eena ho feta.
We were just getting to know him.	Re ne re qala ho mo tseba.
I felt.	Ke ile ka ikutloa.
You might think.	Mohlomong u ka nahana.
As recently as last week.	Haufinyane joalo ka bekeng e fetileng.
They want to get out.	Ba batla ho tsoa.
You do not need help.	Ha u batle thuso.
Some were happy.	Ba bang ba ne ba thabile.
Just because it can.	Hobane feela e ka khona.
We never went any further after that.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra tsoela pele ka mor'a moo.
And you have some really good stuff.	'Me u na le lintho tse ntle haholo.
He just said what he thought.	O ile a bua feela seo a se nahanang.
A little more.	Ka hanyane hape.
And we have them.	Mme re na le tsona.
They will not work.	Ba ke ke ba sebetsa.
For coming first.	Bakeng sa ho tla pele.
I thought he would like it.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o tla e rata.
Who was he? 	E ne e le mang?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
He did not do so.	Ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
She can't eat.	Ha a khone ho ja lijo.
The same is true of giving.	Ho joalo le ho fana.
Except it was not.	Ntle le hore ho ne ho se joalo.
Nothing happened.	Ho ne ho se letho le etsahetseng.
He didn't just walk away.	O ne a sa tsamaea feela.
Why they had everyone behind me.	Ke hobane'ng ha ba ne ba e-na le bohle ka mor'a ka.
It was clear to me at first.	Ho ne ho hlakile ho 'na pele.
That was the way he spoke.	E ne e le tsela eo a e buileng.
Do not try this.	Seke oa leka sena.
It seemed to finally happen.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka qetellong ho etsahala.
We are very hopeful.	Re tšepa haholo.
I wanted to give it a go.	Ke ne ke batla ho fana ka eona.
Good chance.	Monyetla o motle.
There is nothing there.	Haho letho moo.
Yes, he has very good ones.	E, o na le tse ntle haholo.
As you were.	Joalo ka ha u ne u le.
He looked alone.	O ne a shebahala a le mong.
You have to think about him.	O lokela ho nahana ka eena.
That's what my friends are.	Ke seo metsoalle ea ka e leng sona.
However, he is not the only one who loves her.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se eena feela motho ea mo ratang.
And I don't think you will need it.	Hape ha ke nahane hore u tla e hloka.
It still is.	Ho ntse ho le jwalo.
Some like it, some don't.	Ba bang ba e rata, ba bang ha ba e rate.
He declined to comment.	O ile a hana ho fana ka maikutlo.
It just stopped and looked.	E ile ea ema feela ea sheba.
Time played with him.	Nako e ile ea bapala le eena.
Make sure you eat here.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u ja ka mona.
There should be no power here.	Ho ne ho sa lokela ho ba le matla a letho mona.
You know, people move on.	Ua tseba, batho ba tsoela pele.
You can leave your hair on the floor.	U ka tlohela moriri oa hau fatše.
I speak beforehand and very often.	Ke bolela ka pele le hangata haholo.
And a lot of people.	Le batho ba bangata.
You have to keep it up every day.	U tlameha ho e boloka letsatsi le leng le le leng.
, you get a very good idea of ​​what is going on.	, o fumana mohopolo o motle haholo hore na ho etsahalang.
It was a strange feeling.	E ne e le maikutlo a makatsang.
I think we need to fix that.	Ke nahana hore re lokela ho lokisa seo.
But it does happen.	Empa ho etsahala joalo.
And that continued for many years.	'Me seo se ile sa tsoela pele ka lilemo tse ngata.
Then he went into the room.	Joale a kena ka kamoreng.
You have to look very good.	O tlameha ho shebahala hantle haholo.
And thank you so much for being with me.	Mme ke leboha haholo ka ho ba le nna.
Also, the work began in earnest.	Hape, mosebetsi o ile oa qala ka matla.
Work on that.	Sebetsa ho seo.
It's easy.	Ho bonolo.
No, don't cry.	Che, u se ke ua lla.
You know a lot about me baby but it is not enough.	U tseba haholo ka 'na ngoana empa ha hoa lekana.
It's hard to stop that.	Ho thata ho tlohela seo.
I asked him if anyone knew about it.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na ho na le motho ea tsebang ka eona.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
I never read it again.	Ha kea e bala hape.
Of course they were.	Ehlile ba ne ba le jwalo.
It is not difficult, but it is very necessary.	Ha ho thata, empa ho hlokahala haholo.
I know you want to get into the job.	Kea tseba hore u batla ho kena mosebetsing.
They may talk sometimes, saying nothing.	Ba ka ’na ba bua ka linako tse ling, ba sa bue letho.
Once we start this thing to get better.	Hang ha re qala ntho ena ho ba betere.
We have to do both.	Re tlameha ho li etsa ka bobeli.
Doing more than you like.	Ho etsa ho feta seo u se ratang.
He was dressed for the ride.	O ne a apere bakeng sa ho tsamaea.
I could not see anyone.	Ke ne ke sa bone motho.
Maybe it was new.	Mohlomong e ne e le ncha.
What your school needs, we asked the head.	Sekolo sa hao se hloka eng, re ile ra botsa hlooho.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bonahala ho se joalo.
You need to talk to me.	O hloka ho bua le nna.
That was a very nice room.	Eo e ne e le kamore e ntle haholo.
I did not give up.	Ha kea ka ka e tlohela.
He didn't seem to know what to do.	O ne a bonahala a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng.
Surprisingly, some were still alive.	Ho makatsang ke hore ba bang ba ne ba ntse ba phela.
He didn't think it would be enough.	O ne a sa nahane hore ho tla lekana.
But then again, who knows.	Empa hape, ke mang ea tsebang.
They did nothing for him.	Ha baa ka ba mo etsetsa letho.
I will try it.	Ke tla e leka.
He knows the people.	O tseba batho.
He has a team.	O na le sehlopha.
Thanks for reading it.	Ke leboha ho e bala.
Here, we can do something new every day.	Mona, re ka etsa ntho e ncha letsatsi le leng le le leng.
But he asked to see the children.	Empa o ile a kopa ho bona bana.
It made me think of things.	E ile ea etsa hore ke nahane ka lintho.
The child looked one year old.	Ngoana o ne a shebahala a le lilemo li le seng.
He did not want his money.	O ne a sa batle chelete ea hae.
Because he could.	Hobane o ne a ka khona.
And he did so.	Mme a etsa jwalo.
Is it close to here?	E haufi le mona?
You may like it very much.	U ka rata ho e rata haholo.
He did not want to make the same mistake again.	O ne a sa batle ho etsa phoso e tšoanang hape.
But then he spoke again.	Empa joale a bua hape.
We have to try the human method.	Re tlameha ho leka mokhoa oa motho.
We have no way of knowing.	Ha re na mokhoa oa ho tseba.
He did not understand.	O ne a sa utloisise.
If we have ever done that.	Haeba re kile ra etsa joalo.
He needed her there and would be with her there.	O ne a mo hloka moo mme o ne a tla ba le eena moo.
The breakfast was very tasty.	Lijo tsa hoseng li ne li le monate haholo.
I hear them.	Kea ba utloa.
Mine, and others.	Ea ka, le ba bang.
She goes home to spend time with her children.	O ea hae ho ea qeta nako le bana ba hae.
Certainly not me.	Ka sebele ke ne ke se joalo.
However, he will not know where you went.	Leha ho le joalo, a ke ke a tseba hore na u ile kae.
But he was still alive.	Empa o ne a ntse a phela.
He can write.	A ka ngola.
I do not say my own.	Ha ke bolelle ea ka.
Some know.	Ba bang baa tseba.
Some are helpful.	Tse ling li na le thuso.
Start early.	Qala pele ho nako ea.
It makes no sense here.	Ha ho na kelello mona.
It's actually very simple.	Ha e le hantle e bonolo haholo.
His first thought was to call the police.	Mohopolo oa hae oa pele e bile ho letsetsa mapolesa.
Be a real man.	Eba monna wa sebele.
I will tell you what they did.	Ke tla o bolella seo ba se entseng.
The boy was singing as he talked to her.	Moshanyana o ne a bina ha a ntse a bua le eena.
We all went swimming together.	Kaofela re ile ra ea sesa hammoho.
They too paid very well.	Le bona ba ile ba lefa hantle haholo.
I don’t even like to think about it.	Ha ke rate le ho nahana ka eona.
Me and his name anyone.	Nna le lebitso la hae mang kapa mang.
The phone rings all the time.	Mohala o lla ka linako tsohle.
Keeping things up.	Ho boloka lintho li le teng.
He wanted to be with us.	O ne a batla ho ba le rona.
They do not know what a job is.	Ha ba tsebe hore na mosebetsi ke eng.
Just last week he got out of it, though.	Beke feela e fetileng o ile a tsoa ho eona, leha ho le joalo.
Thank you, thank you, girl.	Kea leboha, kea leboha, ngoanana.
But I am too late for that.	Empa ke morao haholo bakeng sa seo.
He knows exactly what he is doing.	O tseba hantle seo a se etsang.
It had to come out.	E ne e tlameha ho tsoa.
I thought it was a good idea at the time.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke mohopolo o motle ka nako eo.
I would love to know who did this.	Nka thabela ho tseba hore na ke mang ea entseng sena.
I would like this.	Nka rata sena.
That is exactly what is happening.	Ke sona se etsahalang hantle.
I'm starting to get here.	Ke qala ho ba mona.
These are difficult times.	Tsena ke linako tse thata.
Too long, it's weird.	E telele haholo, ke ntho e makatsang.
My kids don't want to be with me anymore.	Bana ba ka ha ba sa batla ho ba le nna.
No one spoke much.	Ha ho motho ea buileng haholo.
This seemed to be his favorite activity.	Sena se ne se bonahala e le mosebetsi oo a o ratang haholo.
The man came again that night.	Motho eo o ile a tla hape bosiung boo.
Then he left.	Eaba oa tsamaea.
He did not see anyone else.	Ha a ka a bona motho e mong.
And frankly, he needed it.	'Me ho bua 'nete, o ne a e hloka.
It is not easy at first.	Ha ho bonolo pele.
Each time you understood.	Nako le nako u ile ua utloisisa.
Thanks for your help.	Ke leboha thuso ea hao.
And she is here.	Mme o mona.
Some did.	Ba bang ba ile ba etsa joalo.
Anything was better than me.	Ntho efe kapa efe e ne e le molemo ho feta ho ba 'na.
He still had it.	O ne a ntse a e na le eona.
I'm busy this morning.	Ke phathahane hoseng hona.
No more books.	Ha ho sa na libuka.
I really see that.	Ruri ke bona seo.
And if they find you, hope they'll play well with you.	'Me haeba ba u fumana, tšepa hore ba tla bapala hantle le uena.
Obviously he was not talking.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a sa bue.
Yet they are friends.	Leha ho le joalo ke metsoalle.
He did not expect me to stay.	O ne a sa lebella hore ke tla lula.
He could see me coming back.	O ne a bona ha ke khutla.
That is a lot.	Hoo ho na le ntho e ngata.
You would know them.	U ne u tla ba tseba.
This, too, you must understand.	Sena, le sona, o tlameha ho se utloisisa.
I had no idea what was going to happen.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe se tla etsahala.
It was illegal but sometimes it happened.	E ne e se molao empa ka linako tse ling e ne e etsahala.
You have some good friends here.	U na le metsoalle e molemo mona.
He eats nothing.	Ha a je letho.
I can't understand it.	Ha ke khone ho e utloisisa.
He is still a man.	E sa le monna.
Power.	Matla.
I wanted them for me more than anything.	Ke ne ke li batla ho nna ho feta eng kapa eng.
He will never talk to you again.	Ha a sa tla hlola a bua le wena.
I used the floor.	Ke ne ke sebelisa fatše.
He worked hard.	O ne a sebetsa ka thata.
It is still real today.	E ntse e le ea sebele le kajeno.
Maybe that was the problem.	Mohlomong bothata e ne e le bona.
It certainly did not seem practical.	Ka sebele ho ne ho bonahala eka ha a na thuso.
They are doing just that.	Ba ntse ba etsa joalo.
At times, he enjoyed a simple, difficult ride.	Ka linako tse ling, o ne a thabela ho palama ha bonolo, ho thata.
It is about to become a reality.	Ha e le haufi le ho ba 'nete.
A few more.	Tse ling tse seng kae.
She was glad he didn't see her.	O ne a thabetse hore ebe ha a mo bone.
Yes, they should.	E, ba lokela.
Have you ever been there?	Na u kile ua fihla moo?
Tell them you only need it for a few hours.	Ba bolelle hore u e hloka feela ka lihora tse 'maloa.
You are looking for the best person for the job.	U batla motho ea molemo ka ho fetisisa bakeng sa mosebetsi.
I could not hold it.	Ha kea khona ho e tšoara.
It's anything.	Ke ntho efe kapa efe.
Bicycling has been my passion for riding for years.	Baesekele esale e le mokhoa oa ka oa ho palama ka lilemo.
Thank you so much for you.	Ke leboha haholo ka uena.
I picked her up.	Ke ile ka mo nka.
Time may come again in the future.	Nako e ka tla hape nakong e tlang.
It was not a good place.	E ne e se sebaka se setle.
You may have to stay home at that time.	U ka tlameha ho lula hae ka nako eo .
We will understand this.	Re tla utloisisa sena.
So we just want to be alone.	Kahoo re rata ho ba rona feela.
He did not like going it alone.	O ne a sa rate taba ea ho tsamaea a le mong.
Open for the first major project.	Bula bakeng sa mosebetsi oa pele o moholo.
Things like this have to stay that way.	Lintho tsa mofuta ona li tlameha ho lula li le joalo.
That is why he is going to do it.	Ke ka hona a tlang ho e etsa.
It may be good, but it is not easy to use.	E ka ba lintho tse ntle, empa ha ho bonolo ho li sebelisa.
That is no longer true.	Seo ha e sa le 'nete.
It would not be an issue.	E ne e ke ke ea e-ba taba.
It is difficult to understand what it says.	Ho thata ho utloisisa seo e se buang.
Whether he can do it.	Hore na o khona ho etsa.
Everything is delicious.	Tsohle li monate.
She knew my books well by heart.	O ne a tseba libuka tsa ka hantle ka hlooho.
I shared my thoughts with myself about food.	Ke ile ka bua maikutlo a ka le 'na ka lijo.
It looks very good to him.	E shebahala e le ntle haholo ho eena.
Good food, too.	Lijo tse ntle, hape.
If he could not be with her.	Haeba a ne a sa khone ho ba le eena.
They are all true friends.	Kaofela ke metsoalle ea sebele.
They would never think of their own again.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba hlola ba nahana ka tsa bona hape.
The questions are tiring.	Lipotso li khathetse.
This and many more.	Sena le tse ling tse ngata.
You should come back with me.	U lokela ho khutla le 'na.
However, the second day did not come.	Leha ho le joalo, ha hoa ka ha fihla letsatsi la bobeli.
I think he really did not believe in it.	Ke nahana hore o ne a hlile a sa lumele ho eona.
That was a great opportunity.	Seo e ne e le monyetla o moholo.
They have to work and live.	Ba tlameha ho sebetsa le ho phela.
He still did not have the way he wanted.	O ne a ntse a sena tsela eo a e batlang.
You have to write, but you also have to read.	U tlameha ho ngola, empa hape u tlameha ho bala.
I wanted to understand.	Ke ne ke batla ho utloisisa.
They offered her a job, but she refused.	Ba ile ba mo fa mosebetsi, empa o ile a hana.
Instead, the people grieve and weep.	Ho e-na le hoo, batho ba utloa bohloko le ho lla.
He obviously did not know much about children.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a sa tsebe hakaalo ka bana.
Very fun, very easy to do.	E monate haholo, e bonolo haholo ho e etsa.
Some time.	Nako e itseng.
I know how he thinks.	Ke tseba kamoo a nahanang kateng.
I look at my mother.	Ke sheba mme wa ka.
But again, it did not matter.	Empa hape, ho ne ho se taba.
My mother used it.	’Mè o ne a e sebelisa.
It was the first time for me.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele ho 'na.
She is already suffering.	O se a ntse a utloa bohloko.
He needed to think and plan.	O ne a hloka ho nahana le ho rera.
A car passed by.	Ho ile ha feta koloi.
He hopes you have a wonderful time.	O tšepa hore u na le nako e monate.
We knew then that he did not want us.	Re ile ra tseba ka nako eo hore ha a re batle.
He was good at what he did.	O ne a le motle ho seo a se entseng.
He had made her.	O ne a mo entse.
Many people have been there.	Batho ba bangata ba bile teng.
I write about those other things here.	Ke ngola ka lintho tseo tse ling mona.
Tell him what we know so far.	Mo bolelle seo re se tsebang ho fihlela joale.
But then they paused.	Empa ebe ba ema hanyane.
He knows he's coming.	O a tseba o a tla.
This is fun.	Sena se monate.
I told her there was something wrong with it.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore ho na le phoso ka eona.
It is very difficult to find the type he wants.	Ho thata haholo ho fumana mofuta oo a o batlang.
He is very good at what he does.	O molemo haholo ho seo a se etsang.
Someone or something.	Motho kapa ntho eo.
He enjoyed it.	O ile a e thabela.
But it is beautiful.	Empa e ntle.
He is not an individual.	Ha se motho a le mong.
Then he began to think about food.	Eaba o qala ho nahana ka lijo.
I want to work on it.	Ke batla ho sebetsa ho eona.
He spent his whole life without food.	O ile a qeta bophelo bohle ba hae a sa je.
that life was work.	hore bophelo e ne e le mosebetsi.
Well, he thought.	Ho be jwalo, a nahana.
That is a difficult decision.	Ke qeto e boima.
We must seek His life in us.	Re tlameha ho batla bophelo ba hae ka ho rona.
And it happened at once.	Mme ha etsahala hang.
And many more out there.	Le tse ling tse ngata ka ntle ho moo.
He was very nice.	O ne a le monate haholo.
Stay strong and beautiful.	Ho lula u le matla 'me u le motle.
The husband is usually absent from work.	Hangata monna ha a eo mosebetsing.
That was not the case.	E ne e se eona taba eo.
This is not a good opportunity for us.	Tsena ha se monyetla o motle bakeng sa rona.
Water is essential for life.	Metsi a hlokahala bakeng sa bophelo.
He called again.	A letsa hape.
He could have known that by simply looking at her.	O ne a ka tseba seo ka ho mo sheba feela.
She had a baby girl last year.	O bile le ngoana oa ngoanana selemong se fetileng.
The project took longer than he expected.	Mosebetsi oo o ile oa nka nako e telele ho feta kamoo a neng a lebeletse kateng.
However, it is not something of my type.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se ntho ea mofuta oa ka.
I almost feel like they know this.	Ke batla ke utloa eka ba tseba sena.
He thought of a better time.	O ile a nahana ka nako e monate haholoanyane.
But there is clearly a problem.	Empa ho hlakile hore bothata bo teng.
It is better for us to come together to decide what we will do.	Ho molemo hore re kopane ho etsa qeto ea hore na re tla etsa eng.
I'll drink it if it works.	Ke tla e noa haeba e sebetsa.
Their decision is the only one they can make.	Qeto ea bona ke e 'ngoe feela eo ba ka e etsang.
I do not understand how this should work.	Ha ke utloisise hore na sena se lokela ho sebetsa joang.
Somehow you.	Ka tsela e itseng uena.
You can see it from here.	U ka e bona ho tloha mona.
But we will.	Empa re tla etsa joalo.
You may have understood, but you also may not understand.	E ka 'na eaba u kile ua utloisisa, empa hape u ka 'na ua se ke ua utloisisa.
Your problem must be something else.	Bothata ba hau e tlameha ebe ke ntho e 'ngoe hape.
My father was a difficult man.	Ntate e ne e le motho ea thata.
Do your homework.	Etsa mosebetsi oa hau oa sekolo.
I didn't have to do it, of course.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho e etsa, ehlile.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
Maybe you will.	Mohlomong u tla ba joalo.
Learning is your only thing.	Ho ithuta ke eona feela ntho ea hau.
Why would you want that.	Hobaneng o ka batla seo.
I had to have it.	Ke ne ke lokela ho ba le eona.
The grieving family quickly left.	Lelapa le neng le utloile bohloko le ile la tsamaea kapele.
I think it was me.	Ke nahana hore e ne e le nna.
And we speak just right.	Mme re bua hantle feela.
That's what he has to do.	Ke seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Joalo, ke masoabi haholo.
That's what we want to see.	Ke seo re batlang ho se bona.
You know how you can.	U tseba kamoo u ka khonang.
He had one chance.	O ne a ena le monyetla o le mong.
There was no time to think.	Ho ne ho se nako ea ho nahana.
And it still was.	Mme ho ne ho ntse ho le jwalo.
The decision is clear.	Qeto e hlakile.
I told her that nothing had happened.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore ha ho letho le etsahetseng.
And he does.	Mme o etsa jwalo.
The dinner was delicious!	Lijo tsa mantsiboea li ne li le monate!
This can be very difficult.	Sena se ka ba thata haholo.
He thought so of his life.	O ile a nahana joalo ka bophelo ba hae.
Drinking with him and another woman.	Ho noa le eena le mosali e mong.
It was a good thing to continue.	E ne e le ntho e ntle ho tsoela pele.
Decision with your doctor.	Qeto le ngaka ea hau.
You can learn something from her.	U ka ithuta ho hong ho eena.
I'm even happier for you.	Ke thabile le ho feta ho uena.
Do not come for him.	U se ke ua tla bakeng sa hae.
This was his great opportunity.	Ona e ne e le monyetla oa hae o moholo.
He worked hard at school because his father made him.	O ne a sebetsa ka thata sekolong hobane ntate oa hae o mo entse.
Now they know.	Joale baa tseba.
We did it last night.	Re entse maobane bosiu.
Because there was someone like him.	Hobane ho ne ho e-na le motho ea tšoanang le eena.
They usually come first.	Hangata ba tla pele.
These people are real to us.	Batho bana ke ba sebele ho rōna.
They do not know what to do.	Ha ba tsebe seo ba ka se etsang.
Perhaps it would have been better if he had not done so.	Mohlomong ho ne ho le molemo hore ebe ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
I'm beginning to understand what it means here.	Ke qala ho utloisisa hore na e bolela eng mona.
She is our only child.	Ke ngoana oa rona a le mong.
Not enough.	Ha hoa lekana haholo.
They did this.	Ba entse sena.
They say something.	Ba bua ho hong.
They will not leave.	Ba ke ke ba tloha.
There was this one.	Ho ne ho ena le ena.
I went tonight.	Ke ile bosiung bona.
He did not ask questions.	Ha aa ka a botsa lipotso.
I needed to know what a child could do.	Ke ne ke hloka ho tseba hore na ngoana a ka etsa eng.
Sometimes they even ask for food.	Ka linako tse ling ba bile ba kōpa lijo.
Faster than he expected, too.	Kapele ho feta kamoo a neng a lebeletse, hape.
She was so beautiful.	O ne o le motle haholo.
I did not notice when you entered.	Ha ke a hlokomela ha o kena.
Like shoes, or other.	Joalo ka lieta, kapa tse ling.
He never told us he had a family.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a re bolella hore o na le lelapa.
He knows exactly what to do.	O tseba hantle seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
It is very easy for them.	Ho bonolo haholo bakeng sa bona.
That is nothing.	Seo ha se letho.
The good news is that we are doing this for you.	Litaba tse monate ke hore re u etsetsa sena.
Yes, that's a good idea.	Ee, ke mohopolo o motle.
His friends speak well of him.	Metsoalle ea hae e bua hantle ka eena.
I did it.	Ke ile ka e etsa.
That is good for you.	Seo se molemo ho uena.
Maybe that's the reason.	Mohlomong ke lona lebaka.
They want to go back home.	Ba batla ho khutlela hae.
He decided to seek help.	O ile a nahana ho ea batla thuso.
There is no time to think.	Ha ho nako ea ho nahana.
Seeing things before their time.	Ho bona lintho pele ho nako ea bona.
We have what we need to have.	Re na le seo re lokelang ho ba le sona.
However, he did not sleep.	Leha ho le joalo, ha aa ka a robala.
It was important to finish it.	Ho ne ho le bohlokoa ho e qeta.
Ideas take time to read.	Maikutlo a nka nako ho bala.
He had to decide when to return to work.	O ne a lokela ho etsa qeto ea hore na o khutlela mosebetsing neng.
And delicious food.	Le lijo tse monate.
Is this place uninhabited?	Na sebaka see ha se na batho?
He wanted the things he wanted to buy.	O ile a batla lintho tseo a neng a batla ho li reka.
It was not too late.	E ne e e-s'o be morao haholo.
However, it was too late.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se e le morao haholo.
My money is in 'no'.	Chelete ea ka e ho 'che'.
So he stops.	Kahoo o a ema.
One father returned from work.	Ntate e mong o ile a khutla mosebetsing.
Let's eat!	Ha re je!
It means however.	E bolela leha ho le joalo.
Our team is trying to give you good news.	Sehlopha sa rona se leka ho u fa litaba tse monate.
The best thing we can do is try to get out.	Se molemo ka ho fetisisa seo re ka se etsang ke ho leka ho tsoa.
He was still in the morning.	O ne a sa le hoseng.
Do not go to them.	U se ke ua ea ho bona.
Once we meet, you will know everything.	Hang ha re kopana, u tla tseba tsohle.
Her phone rang in another room.	Mohala oa hae oa lla ka kamoreng e 'ngoe.
It's hard to find the best one for them.	Ho thata ho fumana e ntle ka ho fetisisa ho bona.
He must not know what is going on here.	E tlameha ebe ha a tsebe se etsahalang mona.
But her parents agreed.	Empa batsoali ba hae ba ile ba lumela.
But they just refused.	Empa ba hana feela.
Or bad for you.	Kapa e mpe ho uena.
I just came to see my father.	Ke sa tsoa tla ho tla bona Ntate.
It's dangerous.	Ke kotsi.
He didn't know if he could do it.	O ne a sa tsebe haeba a ka e etsa.
It's almost there, now.	E batla e le teng, jwale.
If children are learning.	Haeba bana ba ntse ba ithuta.
But we do this.	Empa re etsa sena.
He works for me.	O sebetsa bakeng sa ka.
Be strong but gentle.	E-ba matla empa u be bonolo.
He did not have to continue.	O ne a sa tlameha ho tsoela pele.
Then you can do it.	Joale u ka etsa joalo.
But we are still a little further on our own.	Empa re ntse re tsoela pele hanyane ho rona.
Nobody seems to be coming this way.	Ho bonahala ho se motho ea tlang ka tsela ena.
Instead, every day is getting more and more fun.	Ho e-na le hoo, letsatsi le leng le le leng le ntse le e-ba monate haholoanyane.
He alone is the same.	Ke eena feela ea tšoanang.
That seemed impossible now.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka seo se ke ke sa etsahala hona joale.
He did everything.	O entse tsohle.
Definitely to keep it.	Ka sebele ho e boloka.
That was a wonderful time.	Eo e ne e le nako e monate.
We had to find it.	Re ne re tlameha ho o fumana.
I don't want to do anything about this place.	Ha ke batle ho etsa letho ka sebaka sena.
He, too, somehow did not.	Le eena, ka tsela e itseng ho ne ho se joalo.
Stand with them.	Ema le bona.
I will look at my book again.	Ke tla sheba buka ea ka hape.
I know what he wants and what he needs.	Ke tseba seo a se batlang le seo a se hlokang.
This is sad news!	Litaba tsena ke tse bohloko!
He was talking about what happened at school today.	O ne a bua ka ntho e etsahetseng sekolong kajeno.
There is something wrong.	Ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
He was a man.	E ne e le monna.
Try writing something now.	Leka ho ngola ho hong hona joale.
Almost all of them were very good.	Hoo e ka bang kaofela ha bona ba ne ba le molemo haholo.
He seemed to have nothing.	Ho ne ho bonahala a se na letho.
It should have been me who spoke.	E ne e lokela ho ba 'na ea buang.
He had been living with the family for several years.	O ne a qetile lilemo tse ’maloa a lula le lelapa leo.
Who will you meet? 	O tlo kopana le mang?
She is OK.	O phela hantle.
We do not consider this question further.	Ha re nahane ka potso ena ho feta mona.
It was a real emotional moment.	E ne e le nako ea sebele ea maikutlo.
That's the reason.	Ke lona lebaka.
I'm also asking them questions.	Le ’na ke ntse ke ba botsa lipotso.
He could see them, so they were there.	O ne a ba bona, ka hona ba ne ba le teng.
I never want to see them again.	Ha ke sa batla ho ba bona hape.
I hear you.	Kea u utloa.
He wouldn't know now.	O ne a ke ke a tseba jwale.
They don't know.	Ha ba tsebe.
He did not want to be a father.	O ne a sa batle ho ba ntate.
It was needed now.	E ne e hlokahala hona joale.
I did not know how much she was suffering.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na o utloile bohloko hakae.
More than that.	Ho feta ho eona.
Moreover, in advance.	Ho feta moo, esale pele.
I have never been.	Ha ke eso be teng.
However, we find it for everyone except that.	Leha ho le joalo, re fumana bakeng sa bohle ntle le hore .
We are important.	Re ba bohlokoa.
The car was nearby when the accident happened.	Koloi e ne e le haufi ha kotsi e etsahala.
The children also helped.	Bana le bona ba ile ba thusa.
Yes, you know.	E, ua tseba .
I don't think it will take long.	Ha ke nahane hore ho tla nka nako e telele.
That was pretty cool.	Seo se ne se le ntle haholo.
They are there.	Li teng.
But their opinions do not matter.	Empa maikutlo a bona ha a na taba hakaalo.
Maybe this is not the time to ask.	Mohlomong ena hase nako ea ho botsa.
Don't they need a lot of money for a lot of food?	Na ha ba hloke chelete e ngata bakeng sa lijo tse ngata?
We love those things.	Re rata lintho tseo.
I don't know how to get started.	Ha ke tsebe hore na nka qala joang.
Keep up the good work.	Tsoela pele ka mosebetsi o motle.
That encounter did not happen.	Ho kopana hoo ha hoa etsahala.
But you are mine.	Empa u oa ka.
But he never made a suggestion.	Empa ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa tlhahiso.
Nobody wanted to play.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a batla ho bapala.
It's hard to say.	Ho thata ho bua.
Stop right here.	Ema hona mona.
He sang with emotion.	O ile a bina ka maikutlo.
Now, there was a man.	Jwale, ho ne ho ena le motho.
I can't tell you much.	Ha ke khone ho u bolella tse ngata.
This is a work in progress.	Ona ke mosebetsi o teng.
I felt good sitting down.	Ke ile ka utloa ho le monate ho lula fatše.
We will be together next year.	Re tla ba hammoho selemong se tlang.
Things did not go as he had hoped.	Lintho li ne li sa tsamaee kamoo a neng a lebeletse kateng.
It would not have happened.	E ka be e sa ka ea etsahala.
That was my food for thought.	Eo e ne e le lijo tsa ka tsa ho nahana.
That can overcome it well.	Seo se ka e hlola hantle.
I am nothing now.	Ha ke letho hona joale.
I did not plan this.	Ha kea rera sena.
I did not understand that request.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise kopo eo.
And how to get it.	Le mokhoa oa ho e fumana.
Work began immediately.	Mosebetsi o ile oa qala kapele.
She was thinking of her children.	O ne a nahana ka bana ba hae.
Keep it up!.	Pele ea pele!.
It did him no good.	Ha ea ka ea mo thusa letho.
I hope he'll be back soon.	Ke tšepa hore o tla khutla haufinyane.
Someone is talking about his father.	Ho na le motho ea buang ka ntate oa hae.
We are just continuing with the existing work.	Re mpa re tsoela pele ka mosebetsi o teng.
I think that's it.	Ke nahana hore ke eona eo.
There are many questions.	Ho lipotso tse ngata.
There are many more.	Ho na le tse ling tse ngata.
So he said he was swimming.	Kahoo a re a sesa.
I was glad to meet him.	Ke ile ka thabela ho kopana le eena.
Yes, he was.	E, o ne a le teng.
Make sure of the date.	Etsa bonnete ba letsatsi.
We did nothing.	Re ne re sa etse letho.
I have a lot of things to do.	Ke na le lintho tse ngata tseo ke lokelang ho li etsa.
I do not have and I will not.	Ha ke na 'me nke ke ka.
And this other thing, too.	Le ntho e 'ngoe ena, hape.
They have nothing to do with me.	Ha ba na taba le nna.
It had just become a matter of when.	E ne e sa tsoa ba taba ea hore na ke neng.
That was all in the past.	Seo sohle e ne e le khale.
His legs are stronger than my hands.	Maoto a hae a matla ho feta matsoho a ka.
They have to decide on someone else's life.	Ba lokela ho etsa qeto ka bophelo ba motho e mong.
Of course this is not really the case.	Ha e le hantle sena ha se hlile ha se joalo.
Money must be there.	Chelete e tlameha ebe e ntse e le teng.
He spoke of real life.	O ile a bua ka bophelo ba sebele.
Most of the time, we did.	Hangata, re li entse.
He knows exactly why.	O tseba hantle lebaka.
He was very happy.	O ne a thabile haholo.
They are waiting for their husband.	Ba emetse monna oa bona.
Breakfast.	Ho ja lijo tsa hoseng.
He knew what was coming.	O ne a tseba se tlang ho tla.
In fact, he looked good in everything.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a bonahala a le motle ka ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
He does nothing.	Ha a etse letho.
However, this should not be the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha sea lokela ho ba joalo.
She was so cute and she left immediately.	O ne a le motle haholo mme a tloha hang hang.
The one you did not take.	Eo o sa kang oa e nka.
We used to play it.	Re kile ra e bapala.
Her parents worked hard to raise her.	Batsoali ba hae ba ile ba sebetsa ka thata ho mo hlokomela.
And there is no point in it.	'Me ha ho na thuso ho eona.
If he doesn't know, try it together.	Haeba a sa tsebe, leka hammoho.
All of them.	Kaofela .
Thank you so much !.	Ke leboha haholo!.
It was a great opportunity for us.	E ne e le monyetla o motle haholo ho rona.
When you know it well you live better.	Ha o tseba hantle o phela betere.
Which is not a good thing.	E leng hore hase ntho e ntle.
But that is your decision.	Empa ke qeto ea hau.
They are important to them.	Ke ba bohlokoa ka ho bona.
Other than that.	Ntle ho moo.
Her mother had never told her that she loved her.	'Mè oa hae o ne a e-s'o mo bolelle hore oa mo rata.
I ask his name.	Ke botsa lebitso la hae.
Write about me.	Ngola ka nna.
Maybe you will start here.	Mohlomong u tla qala mona.
In fact, they were there.	Ha e le hantle, ba ne ba le teng.
He would understand.	O ne a tla utloisisa.
Soon, that will be the case.	Haufinyane, ho tla ba joalo.
I know Dad was there.	Kea tseba hore Ntate o ne a le teng.
I really am.	Ke hlile ke joalo.
I had no idea what was going on.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe se etsahalang.
That's the problem.	Ke bothata.
I do not believe.	Ha ke lumele.
I worked hard.	Ke ne ke sebetsa ka thata.
I think that would be weird.	Ke nahana hore hoo e ka ba ntho e makatsang.
You saw nothing.	Ha ua ka ua bona letho.
I could not eat or sleep.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho ja kapa ho robala.
Children will love it.	Bana ba tla e rata.
By this time tomorrow, you will know.	Ka nako ena hosane, le tla be le tseba.
He got a job.	O ile a fumana mosebetsi.
You can talk to them without speaking.	U ka bua le bona ntle le ho bua.
Well done, boy.	O entse hantle, moshanyana.
The pain could not continue.	Bohloko bo ne bo sa khone ho tsoela pele.
Whether it is good or bad is very difficult to decide.	Haeba e ntle kapa e mpe ho thata haholo ho etsa qeto.
That's good news.	Ke litaba tse monate.
It worked with its own money.	E ne e sebetsa ka chelete ea eona.
Very good for a person.	E molemo haholo ho motho.
He refused it.	O ile a e hana.
Her father had never spoken to her like that before.	Ntate oa hae o ne a e-s’o ka a bua le eena joalo pele.
And if there were, the task was much easier.	'Me haeba ho ne ho le teng, mosebetsi o ne o le bonolo haholoanyane.
She really likes this.	Ehlile e rata sena.
I often seemed to know exactly what was needed.	Hangata ho ne ho bonahala ke tseba hantle hore na ho hlokahala eng.
Nothing can surprise me right now.	Ha ho letho le ka 'makatsang hona joale.
One reason is that there are so many good things happening.	Lebaka le leng ke hore ho ntse ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tse molemo tse etsahalang.
The picture seems to be moving.	Setšoantšo se bonahala se ntse se tsamaea.
Maybe it is.	Mohlomong ke eona.
Do not buy all your food in advance.	U se ke ua reka lijo tsohle tsa hao esale pele.
You have to do it this way.	O lokela ho etsa ka tsela ena.
That is, we are often invisible.	Ke hore hangata ha re bonahale.
I kept trying.	Ke ile ka ’na ka leka.
But it really was.	Empa ho ne ho hlile ho le joalo.
If you have not already done so, you will never know until you get there.	Haeba ha u so etse joalo, u ke ke ua tseba ho fihlela u fihla moo.
It is a work we do with others, for others.	Ke mosebetsi oo re o etsang le ba bang, bakeng sa ba bang.
He was in danger.	O ne a le kotsing.
Family just enough.	Lelapa le sa tsoa lekana.
Dinner is available tonight.	Lijo tsa mantsiboea li teng bosiung bona.
I saw you do it for them.	Ke bone o ba etsetsa sona.
You might say.	U ka re.
However this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho joalo.
However, they are important.	Leha ho le joalo, ke tsa bohlokoa.
You have to want to plan that.	U tlameha ho batla ho rera seo.
There is a long way to go.	Ho na le tsela e telele ea ho tsamaea.
We are human beings.	Re batho.
Neither do we.	Le rōna ha re etse joalo.
But there is more to come.	Empa ho sa ntse ho e-na le tse ling tse tlang.
You should always take care of them.	Ka linako tsohle u lokela ho ba hlokomela.
No one will ever know about this.	Ha ho motho ea tla tseba ka sena.
Maybe he is doing that.	Mohlomong o ntse a etsa joalo.
Which we could not do because we had no money.	E leng seo re neng re sitoa ho se etsa hobane re ne re se na chelete.
Find it here.	E fumane mona.
But he could see nothing.	Empa o ne a sa bone letho.
Finding time !.	Ho fumana nako!.
It asks after you.	E botsa ka mor'a hao.
However, it is not enough.	Leha ho le joalo, ha hoa lekana.
I really wanted to finish my degree.	Ke ne ke hlile ke batla ho qeta lengolo la ka.
He watched this one.	O ile a shebella ena.
Her parents stood behind her.	Batsoali ba hae ba ile ba ema ka mor'a hae.
They really knew it well.	Ba ne ba hlile ba e tseba hantle.
He had something to think about.	O ne a na le seo a ka se nahanang.
But these look great, and you can use them.	Empa tsena li shebahala li le ntle, 'me u ka li sebelisa.
There was a time when nothing seemed to be happening.	Ho na le nako eo ho neng ho bonahala ho se letho le etsahalang.
But they did not have to.	Empa ba ne ba sa lokela ho etsa joalo.
Otherwise, it would have been worse for me.	Ntle ho moo, e ka be e bile mpe le ho feta ho 'na.
Here again, it is the same idea.	Mona hape, ke mohopolo o tšoanang.
She is delicious.	O monate.
He wants to be treated like a man.	O batla ho tšoaroa joalo ka monna.
Love now, give now.	Rata joale, fana joale.
Obviously it would be.	Ho hlakile hore e ne e tla ba joalo.
Some of them will be there.	Ba bang ba bona ba tla ba teng.
There is something else.	Ho na le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I was unaware.	Ke ne ke sa hlokomela.
But they were not his people.	Empa e ne e se batho ba hae.
This work is in progress.	Mosebetsi ona o ntse o tsoela pele.
I doubt anyone will do that.	Ke belaela hore mang kapa mang o tla etsa joalo.
I loved him as a son.	Ke ne ke mo rata joaloka mora.
I heard what you did.	Ke utloile seo u se entseng.
That will give us enough time.	Seo se tla re fa nako e lekaneng.
The police stopped there.	Mapolesa a ile a ema moo.
We memorized it.	Re ile ra e tšoara ka hlooho.
The legal process.	Tsela ya molao.
Most people sleep through the night.	Batho ba bangata ba robala bosiu bohle.
We only have one thing.	Re na le ntho feela.
It was hard work.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima.
The same is true of a book.	Ho joalo le ka buka.
If your opinion is positive.	Haeba maikutlo a hau a monate.
Like a man.	Joalo ka monna.
Which is a very strange thing.	E leng ntho e makatsang haholo.
It works very well.	E sebetsa hantle haholo.
The family will be there.	Lelapa le tla ba teng.
I'll wait until you're done.	Ke tla ema ho fihlela o qetile.
It was just one.	E ne e le 'ngoe feela.
We may have problems.	Re ka nna ra kopana le mathata.
However, you can stay.	Leha ho le joalo, u ka lula.
It was gone, like everything else.	E ne e ile, joalo ka tse ling tsohle.
Now he needed his time.	Hona joale o ne a hloka nako ea hae.
It was just beautiful.	E ne e le ntle feela.
They play and you just feel how good they are.	Li bapala 'me u ikutloa feela hore na li ntle hakae.
But we can't know unless they do it.	Empa re ke ke ra tseba ntle le hore ba e etse.
He was not always shy.	E ne e se kamehla a leng lihlong.
I'm just asking you to see.	Ke mpa ke kopa hore o bone.
Look around you, baby.	Sheba haufi le uena, ngoana.
People ask how they can do it too.	Batho ba botsa hore na le bona ba ka e etsa joang.
He should refuse, but.	O lokela ho hana, empa.
I really liked that.	Ke ne ke rata seo haholo.
Take another one.	Nka e 'ngoe.
He would rather hear about his day than talk about his own.	A ka mpa a utloa ka letsatsi la hae ho e-na le ho bua ka tsa hae.
We cannot make such a decision.	Re ke ke ra etsa qeto joalo feela.
We are very good and maybe we will say yes.	Re motle haholo mme mohlomong re tla re e.
Others will work for me, as well as their children.	Ba bang ba tla sebetsa bakeng sa ka, hammoho le bana ba bona.
He had done this before.	O ne a kile a etsa sena pele.
You have to ask yourself what you want from him.	U lokela ho ipotsa hore na u batla eng ho eena.
The real thing is what you are.	Ntho ea sebele ke seo u leng sona.
She looks so cute.	O bonahala a le monate haholo.
The doctor will help her today.	Ngaka e tla mo thusa kajeno.
He's no use to us, now.	Ha a na thuso ho rona, jwale.
Like, he's really tough.	Joalo ka, o hlile o thata.
He agreed to try it.	O ile a lumela ho e leka.
The two seemed unrelated.	Bobeli bona bo ne bo bonahala bo sa kopane.
But they all have to learn hard.	Empa kaofela ba tlameha ho ithuta ka thata.
No one was really talking about it.	Ha ho motho ea neng a hlile a bua ka eona.
A very important book, of course.	Buka ea bohlokoa haholo, ho hlakile.
I wondered where this amazing player came from.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na sebapali sena se makatsang se tsoa kae.
They really do.	Ba hlile ba etsa joalo.
But still he knew.	Empa leha ho le joalo o ne a tseba.
You will love my place.	U tla rata sebaka sa ka.
We can work.	Re ka sebetsa.
He is very good for his age.	O hantle haholo bakeng sa lilemo tsa hae.
He knew what he wanted.	O ne a tseba seo a se batlang.
When you go.	Ha o ea.
I have food.	Ke na le lijo.
I can eat anything.	Nka ja eng kapa eng.
I loved you more than you can say.	Ke ne ke o rata ho feta ha o sa bue.
After that, she felt better.	Ka mor’a moo, o ile a ikutloa a le betere.
He was just over thirty years old.	O ne a sa tsoa feta lilemo tse mashome a mararo.
What can you do for a child.	Ke eng eo u ka e etsang ho ngoana.
You are earning better money now.	U ntse u fumana chelete e betere hona joale.
But he did.	Empa o entse joalo.
The thing is, he did not know if he could.	Taba ke hore, o ne a sa tsebe hore na a ka khona.
The years made him talk even more.	Lilemo li ile tsa etsa hore a bue le ho feta.
I love where we are.	Ke rata moo re leng teng.
I want that now.	Ke batla seo ha jwale.
No one is coming.	Ha ho motho ea tla.
I can't see very well.	Ha ke bone hantle.
This is not necessarily a problem.	Sena ha se hakaalo hore ke bothata.
It has made it easy to imagine.	E entse hore ho be bonolo ho nahana.
It did not work.	Ha ea ka ea sebetsa.
We will not live.	Re ke ke ra phela.
He says he can't do it.	O bolela hore a ke ke a e etsa.
Before going to bed.	Pele a robala.
An important issue.	Taba ea bohlokoa.
For our start date.	Bakeng sa letsatsi la rona la ho qala.
This can happen to anyone.	Sena se ka etsahala ho mang kapa mang.
It may not be so in the long run.	Ho ka 'na ha se ke ha e-ba joalo ka nako e telele.
The police arrested him.	Mapolesa a ile a mo tšoara.
That will tell you a lot.	Seo se tla o bolella haholo.
He knows more than anyone else what happened.	O tseba ho feta mang kapa mang se etsahetseng.
So, here it goes.	Kahoo, mona ho ea.
It looked so good.	E ile ea bonahala e le ntle haholo.
I think so .	Ke nahana joalo .
It fits him well.	E mo lekana hantle.
Breakfast was a lot easier.	Lijo tsa hoseng li ne li le bonolo haholoanyane.
His friends always wanted to be with him.	Metsoalle ea hae e ne e lula e rata ho ba le eena.
But he survived.	Empa o ile a phela.
Some found nothing.	Ba bang ha baa ka ba fumana letho.
It is not visible.	Ha e bonahale.
Help for today.	Thuso bakeng sa kajeno.
Anyway, very hard.	Joalo, ka thata haholo.
I started walking again.	Ke ile ka qala ho tsamaea hape.
However, it will be difficult to take the first place.	Leha ho le joalo, ho tla ba thata ho nka sebaka sa pele.
I will pay anything.	Ke tla lefa eng kapa eng.
I have it right here.	Ke na le eona hona mona.
He spends all his time studying.	O qeta nako eohle ea hae a ithuta.
This was not for him.	Sena e ne e se bakeng sa hae.
And maybe they don't understand.	'Me mohlomong ha ba utloisise.
Ask all the questions you think you should ask.	Botsa lipotso tsohle tseo u nahanang hore u lokela ho li botsa.
If you would like to know more, please ask !.	Haeba u ka rata ho tseba haholoanyane, ka kopo botsa!.
I'm so glad to see you!	Ke thabile haholo ho u bona!
Then someone stood behind me.	Eaba motho e mong o ema ka mor’a ka.
There were other things.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ling.
I am driving an old car.	Ke khanna koloi ea khale.
Let's see what he comes up with.	A re bone hore na o tla ka eng hape.
You did it alone.	U e entse u le mong.
People often want things, but they don't need them.	Hangata lintho tseo batho ba li batlang, empa ha ba li hloke.
They enjoyed delicious food.	Ba ile ba thabela lijo tse monate.
So go ahead if you want to.	Kahoo tsoela pele haeba u batla.
But this can stand well.	Empa sena se ka ema hantle.
It exists.	E teng.
What he heard in his head, no one will know.	Seo a ileng a se utloa ka hlooho ea hae, ha ho motho ea tla tseba.
Now.	Hona joale.
No one came first.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a tla pele.
I still wonder.	Ke ntse ke ipotsa.
Now, you have to find out where this is coming from.	Joale, o tlameha ho fumana hore na sena se tsoa hokae.
No one will be harmed.	Ha ho motho ea tla tsoa kotsi.
It's just beautiful.	E ntle feela.
A little.	Hanyane.
He gave her a son.	O ne a mo fa mora.
If you want him you will have to come through me.	Haeba u mo batla u tla tlameha ho tla ka 'na.
You can see many new ones now.	U ka bona tse ngata tse ncha hona joale.
They will come looking for it.	Ba tla tla batla.
It looked wrong.	E ne e shebahala e le phoso.
You can be my age.	O ka ba lilemo tsa ka.
However, you probably have someone.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong o na le motho.
I hope to see some of you there !.	Ke tšepa ho bona ba bang ba hau moo!.
Of course, it will take time to fix it.	Ehlile, ho tla nka nako ho lokisa.
I just seem to be coming up with some questions.	Ke bonahala feela ke tla le lipotso tse ling.
Try this.	Leka ka sena.
Everyone is so excited to work with him.	Motho e mong le e mong o monate haholo ho sebetsa le eena.
It was hard to find your first path.	Ho ne ho le thata ho fumana tsela ea hau ea pele.
Three times.	Ka makhetlo a mararo.
To ask you.	Ho u botsa.
I thought it was just good.	Ke ne ke nahana hore e ntle feela.
To parents.	Ho batsoali.
Which was great.	E neng e le ntle.
Of course, it wasn’t a problem, but it made me get it.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e se bothata, empa e etsa hore ke bo fumane.
He wants a better job.	O batla mosebetsi o betere.
I have to keep learning.	Ke tlameha ho tsoela pele ho ithuta.
He should not be around me.	Ha a lokela ho ba haufi le nna.
But there are many others like him.	Empa ho na le ba bang ba bangata ba tšoanang le eena.
This is the best way of life.	Ena ke tsela e molemo haholo ea ho phela.
I think you might like it too.	Ke nahana hore le uena u ka e rata.
The same is true of all others.	Ho joalo le ka ba bang kaofela.
They want to be strong.	Ba batla ho ba matla.
It keeps you in place.	E o boloka o le sebakeng.
However, he could.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a ka khona.
Of course there is.	Ehlile ho teng.
Everyone knew about it.	E mong le e mong o ne a tseba ka eona.
He did not even ask where they were going.	Ha aa ka a botsa le hore na ba ea hokae.
But this is not an easy process.	Empa sena ha se mokhoa o bonolo.
I really need to do that.	Ke hlile ke hloka ho etsa joalo.
We could not do that.	Re ne re ke ke ra etsa joalo.
It is of no use to anyone.	Ha ho thuso ho mang kapa mang.
They are still clear today.	Li ntse li hlakile le hona joale.
I once loved him.	Ke kile ka mo rata.
But he did not make money.	Empa ha a ka a etsa chelete.
Morning is a wonderful time of day.	Hoseng ke nako e monate ea letsatsi.
We children loved it.	Rōna bana re ne re li rata.
They refused.	Ba hana.
We were from an old school.	Re ne re tsoa sekolong sa khale.
We suggest here that it is not so.	Re fana ka maikutlo mona hore ha ho joalo.
It was the same with his son.	Ho bile joalo le ka mora oa hae.
They come in here.	Ba kena ka mona.
And it is not hard to see that it is so.	'Me ha ho thata ho bona hore ho joalo.
All about them.	Tsohle ka bona.
And it was really fun.	Mme ho ne ho le monate haholo.
You feel like you are really doing something to help.	U ikutloa eka u hlile u etsa ho hong ho thusa.
Here is the same thing.	Taba e tšoanang ke ena.
He did not know what to do or where to go.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a etse eng kapa a ee hokae.
The car will be waiting for your arrival.	Koloi e tla be e emetse ho fihla ha hau.
I needed a thought too soon.	Ke ne ke hloka mohopolo le kapele.
There is a way out.	Ho na le tsela ea ho tsoa.
And my first thought was to quit.	'Me mohopolo oa ka oa pele e bile ho tlohela.
So true.	Ke 'nete haholo.
He will know whether we should tell him or not.	O tla tseba hore re mo bolelle kapa che.
Do you think he is innocent?	Na u nahana hore ha a na molato?
Thus, the possibility of error was present.	Ka hona, monyetla oa phoso o ne o le teng.
We played it a lot.	Re ne re e bapala haholo.
First letter.	Lengolo la pele.
I just started looking for it.	Ke sa tsoa qala ho e batla.
Her family can read and write.	Lelapa la hae le tseba ho bala le ho ngola.
This is how you can do this.	Ena ke tsela eo u ka etsang sena ka eona.
They don't know how long.	Ha ba tsebe hore na ke nako e kae.
It really was that way.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le jwalo.
It is not an easy decision in the long run.	Ha se qeto e bonolo ka nako e telele.
We wanted to play like them.	Re ne re batla ho bapala joaloka bona.
I don't see anybody in here.	Ha ke bone motho ka mona.
I love her so much.	Ke mo rata haholo.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Mohlomong ke ntho e ntle.
And he never makes a mistake.	Mme ha ho mohla a etsang phoso.
He will never forget it.	E ke ke ea e lebala.
This means that something is wrong.	Sena se bolela hore ho na le phoso.
I love them so much.	Ke ba rata haholo haholo.
I bought one.	Ke ile ka reka e 'ngoe.
Lots of it.	E ngata hoo e ka bang.
Sometimes people make it weird.	Ka linako tse ling batho ba etsa hore e be ntho e makatsang.
And now he was gone.	Mme jwale o ne a ile.
He was in a car accident.	O ne a le kotsing ea koloi.
No one knows who he is or where he is.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na ke mang kapa hore na o hokae.
And power.	Le matla.
However, that means you will have to go back.	Leha ho le joalo, hoo ho bolela hore o tla tlameha ho khutlela morao.
Keep talking while you work.	Tsoela pele ho bua ha u ntse u sebetsa.
And this is not much.	'Me sena ha se ngata.
And more.	Le ho feta.
However, you do not have to say much.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ua tlameha ho e bua haholo.
It seems I can't do this.	Ho bonahala eka ha ke khone ho etsa sena.
I did not consider giving any help.	Ke ne ke sa nahane ho fana ka thuso leha e le efe.
I should not seek him.	ha kea lokela ho mo batla.
But he was not there.	Empa o ne a le sieo.
You did it.	U e entse.
Everyone could have moved on with their lives.	E mong le e mong o ka be a ile a tsoela pele ka bophelo ba hae.
I told her the food was delicious, to keep her happy.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore lijo li monate, ho mo boloka a thabile.
They started to cry.	Ba ile ba qala ho lla.
We will do that for you.	Re tla o etsetsa seo.
I don't care that.	Ha ke tsotelle seo.
Getting started is easy.	Ho qala ho bonolo.
Enter.	Kena.
He always does that.	O etsa joalo kamehla.
People loved him.	Batho ba ne ba mo rata.
You need a doctor.	O hloka ngaka.
Think about what they might plan.	Nahana ka seo ba ka ’nang ba se rera.
They tend to work hard.	Ba tloaetse ho sebetsa ka thata.
We eat it.	Rea e ja.
I just don't understand.	Ke mpa ke sa utloisise.
But they will probably continue to play the same way.	Empa mohlomong ba tla tsoela pele ho bapala ka tsela e tšoanang.
It was very dangerous.	Ho ne ho le kotsi haholo.
How much they said it.	Ba ne ba e bolela hakae.
See! 	Bona!
They are very good.	Li ntle haholo.
How do we make delicious food?	Re etsa lijo tse monate joang?
Then you see it.	Ebe ua e bona.
He was powerful.	O ne a na le matla.
I really don't want to see that book again.	Ruri ha ke batle ho bona buka eo hape.
So he thought she was beautiful.	Kahoo a nahana hore o motle.
They are human beings just like all of us.	Ke batho joaloka rōna kaofela.
It looks like money.	E shebahala joaloka chelete.
As it could be.	Joalo ka ha ho ka ba joalo.
I did not expect this.	Ha kea lebella sena.
I will be human.	Ke tla ba motho.
I will not go in.	nke ke ka kena.
You want to hear it all.	U batla ho utloa tsohle.
So that's true.	Kahoo seo ke ’nete.
He seemed to like the way he did it.	O ne a bonahala a rata tsela eo a e entseng ka eona.
It is better to use common sense.	Ho molemo ho sebelisa kelello.
The only problem was the way we lived.	Bothata feela e ne e le tsela eo re neng re lula ho eona.
Children often ask for money.	Hangata bana ba kopa chelete.
You must love it.	U tlameha ho e rata.
Family is also important here, too.	Lelapa le lona le bohlokoa mona, hape.
This is a long time in advance.	Sena ke nako e telele esale pele.
It is absurd to think of it.	Ke ntho e hlokang kelello ho nahana ka eona.
The object will move immediately and stop.	Ntho e tla tsamaea hang ebe e ema.
I know a lot of people.	Ke tseba batho ba bangata.
I will not say.	Nke ke ka bolela.
No one is sure.	Ha ho motho ea nang le bonnete.
If this were your only job, of course, a few hours' work.	Haeba ona e ne e le mosebetsi oa hau feela, ehlile, mosebetsi oa lihora tse 'maloa.
We find it difficult to learn here.	Re fumana ho le thata ho ithuta mona.
We did not like it.	Ha rea ​​ka ra e rata.
We wanted to talk to them more.	Re ne re batla ho bua le bona haholoanyane.
I was not sure it would work.	Ke ne ke sena bonnete ba hore e tla sebetsa.
If anyone can do it, they can do it.	Haeba mang kapa mang a ka e etsa, a ka e etsa.
One day, he just walked away.	Ka letsatsi le leng, o ile a tloha feela.
It is important to understand this.	Ho bohlokoa ho utloisisa sena.
I am a doctor by profession.	Ke ngaka ka mosebetsi.
He does not want to go.	Ha a batle ho tsamaea.
Very, very.	Haholo, haholo.
We passed him and he came.	Re ile ra mo feta a tla.
I can't find it anywhere!	Ha ke e fumane kae kapa kae!
They were together last night.	Ba ne ba le hammoho bosiung ba maobane.
I did not expect anything from others.	Ha kea lebella letho ho ba bang.
He knew very well.	O ne a tseba haholo.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako ea ho leka ntho e ncha.
It happens several times a day, sometimes at the same time.	E etsahala ka makhetlo a 'maloa ka letsatsi, ka linako tse ling ka nako e tšoanang.
This year it is so.	Selemong sena ho joalo.
It works well.	E sebetsa hantle.
He refused to do so.	A hana ho etsa joalo.
He did not come.	Ha a ka a tla.
You know it too.	Le uena ua e tseba.
Her stomach was worse than before.	Mpa ea hae e ne e le mpe ho feta pele.
It's not that my favorite food is yours.	Hase hore lijo tseo ke li ratang haholo ke tsa hao.
I'm guilty.	Ke molato.
It is easy to say.	Ho bonolo ho bua.
I had to go back.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho khutlela morao.
I know your thoughts.	Ke tseba maikutlo a hao.
I would give my life for him.	Ke ne ke tla fana ka bophelo ba ka bakeng sa hae.
He can speak, but he does not speak.	O khona ho bua, empa ha a bue.
People would go to work in the morning and return home at night.	Batho ba ne ba ea mosebetsing hoseng ’me ba khutlela hae bosiu.
All we can do is wait and see.	Seo re ka se etsang feela ke ho ema re bone.
Although he was older than I was, he was gentle.	Le hoja a ne a le moholo ho 'na, o ne a le bonolo.
We should have done the same.	Le rōna re ne re lokela hore ebe re etsa se tšoanang.
So can we sit down?	Joale na re ka lula fatše?
Then it goes on a little bit.	Ebe e tsoela pele hanyane.
If the man was not sure.	Haeba monna o ne a sa tsebe hantle.
She's not very sweet.	Ha a monate haholo.
But they knew where it was.	Empa ba ne ba tseba moo e leng teng.
They will not be harmed.	Ba ke ke ba tsoa kotsi.
We do exactly the same things they do.	Re etsa lintho tse tšoanang hantle le tseo ba li etsang.
He came to live with us.	O ile a tla ho tla lula le rōna.
He thinks it is wrong.	O nahana hore ke phoso.
We help the children of such people.	Re thusa bana ba batho ba joalo.
It's just my opinion.	Ke maikutlo a ka feela.
What is wrong.	Ke eng e mpe.
It was a good thing, he thought.	E ne e le ntho e ntle, o ne a nahana.
I refuse to do it again.	Ke hana ho e etsa hape.
The view is very interesting.	Maikutlo a monate haholo.
I can say it.	Ke khona ho e bua.
He refused to come.	A hana ho tla.
That was exactly what he needed.	E ne e le sona seo a neng a se hloka.
Only you can speak.	Ke uena feela ea ka buang.
Anyway, thank you.	Leha ho le joalo, kea leboha.
He did not speak alone.	Ha a ka a bua a le mong.
Then he came.	Eaba oa tla.
I find it difficult to.	Ke fumana ho le thata ho.
There are many such.	Ho na le ba bangata ba joalo.
It will do nothing for this.	E ka se etse letho ho sena.
And they kept coming.	Mme ba nna ba ntse ba tla.
He did a very good job.	O entse mosebetsi o motle haholo.
He did it this morning.	O e entse hoseng hona.
If he ever saw someone again.	Haeba o kile a bona motho hape.
There were too many people.	Ho ne ho e-na le batho ba bangata haholo.
My mother was injured.	’Mè o ile a tsoa kotsi.
We need his power.	Re hloka matla a hae.
No one wants to thank his life.	Ha ho motho ea batlang ho leboha bophelo ba hae.
We will fix it.	Re tla e lokisa.
Of course, it will not.	Ha e le hantle, e ke ke.
Of course, it was too late.	Ehlile, e ne e se e le morao haholo.
Just love them.	Ba rate feela.
Maybe you can make a man out of him.	Mohlomong u ka etsa monna ka eena.
These are children.	Bana ke bana.
Finding the right balance is very important.	Ho fumana ho lekana hantle ho bohlokoa haholo.
Kind of tough.	Mofuta o thata.
I can't thank people enough for this.	Ha ke khone ho leboha batho ka ho lekaneng bakeng sa sena.
He didn't want to talk about anything else.	O ne a sa batle ho bua ka letho hape.
Of course, it's very simple.	Ha e le hantle, ho bonolo haholo.
There was no other place.	Ho ne ho se na sebaka se seng.
They both had their problems.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba e-na le mathata a bona.
I hope he comes back.	Ke tšepa hore o tla khutla.
We know what we need to see.	Re tseba seo re lokelang ho se bona.
Well, they probably do.	Be, mohlomong ba etsa joalo.
It is a great opportunity.	Ke monyetla o moholo.
It was as if no one had ever passed them before.	E ne eka ha ho mohla motho a kileng a li feta pele.
He must find a way to take care of his family.	O tlameha ho fumana mokhoa oa ho hlokomela lelapa la hae.
No one knew him.	Ha ho motho eo a neng a mo tseba.
I see you will go.	Kea u bona u tla u tsamaea.
It's incredibly fun there.	Ho monate ka tsela e makatsang moo.
I did it again.	Ke e entse hape.
Hopefully they will come out with something better in the future.	Re tšepa hore ba tla tsoa le ho hong ho molemo nakong e tlang.
He saw it all at once.	O ile a bona tsohle ka nako e le 'ngoe.
You don't have to talk about me.	Ha o a tlameha ho bua ka nna.
Very good player.	Sebapali se setle haholo.
But my friends have to be there.	Empa metsoalle ea ka e tlameha ho ba teng.
Well, you know about that.	Be, o tseba ka seo.
The second life is still fun.	Bophelo ba bobeli bo ntse bo le monate.
However, be careful.	Leha ho le joalo, hlokomela.
He did not have his own life.	O ne a sena bophelo ba hae.
Worse than you might think.	E mpe ho feta kamoo o ka nahanang ka teng.
I really like everything.	Ke hlile ke rata tsohle.
The way we are.	Ka mokhoa oo re leng ka teng.
And now, he knew better.	Mme jwale, o ne a tseba ho feta.
They can do what they want.	Ba ka etsa seo ba se ratang.
Not much, but we do not do this for money.	Ha e ngata, empa ha re etse sena bakeng sa chelete.
Then the crying goes away.	Joale ho lla ho feta.
Obviously, we cannot continue as we are.	Ho hlakile hore re ke ke ra tsoela pele kamoo re leng kateng.
There was no reason for them to do so.	Ho ne ho se na lebaka la hore ba etse joalo.
Now, here it is.	Jwale, ke ena.
He just didn't care.	O ne a sa tsotelle feela.
Please believe it, believe it.	Ke kopa u e lumele, u e lumele.
Except we didn't do that.	Ntle le hore ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
That is why he was here.	Ke kahoo a neng a le mona.
As we sat down, another family passed by.	Ha re lula fatše, lelapa le leng le ile la feta.
It is the end of the day.	E se e le qetellong ea letsatsi.
Only a man has a job to do.	Ke monna feela ea nang le mosebetsi oo a lokelang ho o etsa.
I made it clear.	Ke entse ho hlakile.
We have a lot going on here.	Re na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang mona.
I just hope this never happens to me or anyone.	Ke tšepa feela hore ha ho mohla sena se tla etsahala ho 'na kapa ho mang kapa mang.
And spend more time with your children.	Le ho qeta nako e ngata le bana ba hau.
We have what we need.	Re na le seo re se hlokang.
But it can be very difficult.	Empa ho ka ba thata haholo.
We see it as we really are.	Re e bona kamoo re leng kateng.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
Opinions are just emotions.	Maikutlo ke maikutlo feela.
Life seems to be happening this way.	Bophelo bo bonahala bo etsahala ka tsela ena.
It's never too late.	Ha e-s'o be morao haholo.
You just have to pay more.	U tlameha feela ho lefa ho feta.
After the meal there would be a drinking party.	Ka mor'a lijo ho ne ho tla ba le mokete oa ho noa.
It still works.	E ntse e sebetsa.
He is a gentle man.	Ke motho ea bonolo.
So they are alive.	Kahoo baa phela.
Well, just talk to me if anything happens.	Be, bua le 'na feela haeba ho etsahala letho.
No one could help you.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka u thusa.
She was beautiful, but she was not my type.	O ne a le motle, empa e ne e se mofuta wa ka.
So, we’ll talk about both.	Ka hona, re tla bua ka bobeli.
His feelings were important to her.	Maikutlo a hae e ne e le a bohlokoa ho eena.
I will make dinner.	Ke tla etsa lijo tsa mantsiboea.
We can go.	Re ka tsamaea.
Because it should.	Hobane e lokela.
It didn't seem like he was really asking us.	Ho ne ho sa bonahale eka o ne a hlile a re botsa.
Going to bed before dinner?	Ho robala pele ho lijo tsa mantsiboea?
He just wanted to see you one last time.	O ne a mpa a batla ho u bona lekhetlo la ho qetela.
Neither should you.	Le uena ha ua lokela ho etsa joalo.
And we almost have no time.	'Me re batla re se na nako.
She cried.	O ile a lla.
Not often.	Hangata ha ho joalo.
He is still there.	O ntse a le teng.
While he had nothing, he drank more.	Ha a ntse a se na letho, o ile a noa ho feta.
And if they were.	Mme haeba ba ne ba le teng.
How much time do you have.	Ke nako e kae eo u nang le eona.
I quit that.	Ke tlohela seo.
So he came to live here.	Kahoo o ile a tla ho tla lula mona.
That is not real.	Seo hase ntho ea sebele.
We do not have a child.	Ha re na ngoana.
I am no longer afraid.	Ha ke sa tšaba.
I had no place of that value in me.	Ke ne ke se na sebaka sa bohlokoa boo ho 'na.
I was thinking about you yesterday.	Ke ne ke ntse ke nahana ka uena maobane.
Water is essential for life.	Metsi a bohlokoa bakeng sa bophelo.
Yet he did not know what to make.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a sa tsebe hore na o tla etsa qeto efe.
The good news is that you do not need them.	Litaba tse monate ke hore ha u li hloke.
I don't want to do anything about it.	Ha ke batle ho etsa letho ka hona.
That is even harder.	Eo e thata ho feta.
You are the first.	U oa pele.
You would think.	U ne u tla nahana.
For the first time he understood.	Ka lekhetlo la pele o ile a utloisisa.
Which happened that night when he died.	E leng se ileng sa etsahala bosiung boo ha a hlokahala.
Read the work carefully.	Bala mosebetsi oo ka hloko.
No one likes a better person than anything else.	Ha ho motho ea ratang motho ea molemo ho tsohle.
We will just come.	Re tla feela.
Hard working.	O sebetsa ka thata.
The same is true of the second and fourth truths.	Ho joalo le ka 'nete ea bobeli le ea bone.
Nothing happened.	Ha ho letho le kileng la etsahala.
More than you think.	Ho feta kamoo o nahanang.
It goes on and on.	E ntse e tsoela pele.
Just read his books.	Bala libuka tsa hae feela.
I really did not understand the name.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa utloisise lebitso.
But please.	Empa ka kopo.
And there is a very simple reason.	Mme ho na le lebaka le bonolo haholo.
It wasn't something he did much.	E ne e se ntho eo a e entseng haholo.
They love it so much.	Ba e rata haholo.
We never talked about you.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra bua ka uena.
But that is not the case.	Empa le hona ha ho joalo.
That makes it important.	Seo se etsa hore e be bohlokoa.
I think it will be the same for you.	Ke na le maikutlo a hore ho tla ba joalo le ho uena.
That makes you want to do something.	Seo se etsa hore o batle ho etsa eng.
They will all be here.	Kaofela ba tla ba teng mona.
It is better to finish it.	Ho molemo ho e qeta.
I hear you ask.	Ke utloa u botsa.
He opened the door.	A bula lemati.
His last book.	Buka ea hae ea ho qetela.
Too many do not do that.	Ba bangata haholo ha ba etse joalo.
He had to think about it more.	O ne a lokela ho nahana ka eona haholoanyane.
Nor should it.	Hape ha ea lokela ho ba joalo.
They were powerful things.	E ne e le lintho tse matla.
They knew nothing.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe letho.
An error occurred.	Ho na le phoso e etsahetseng.
Do not drink too much, otherwise there will be a problem.	U se ke ua noa haholo, ho seng joalo ho tla ba le bothata.
I could be there for them.	Nka ba teng bakeng sa bona.
I have everything you could possibly want.	Ke na le sohle seo u ka se batlang.
Make it beautiful.	Etsa hore e be e ntle.
It never worked well.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea sebetsa hantle.
She cried.	A lla.
I give it to you.	Ke u fa eona.
Well, get in here.	Be, kena ka mona.
So far it seems to be working.	Ho fihlela joale ho bonahala ho sebetsa.
Then we found him.	Eaba rea ​​mo fumana.
The work would take several hours.	Mosebetsi oo o ne o tla nka lihora tse 'maloa.
But you do not need my help.	Empa ha o hloke thuso ea ka.
You’ve had some really good stuff.	U bile le lintho tse ntle haholo.
That is the decision.	Ke qeto eo.
I met him for the first time.	Ke ile ka kopana le eena lekhetlo la pele feela.
However, that did not last long.	Leha ho le joalo, seo ha sea ka sa nka nako e telele.
We will meet.	Re tla kopana.
This is what we do.	Sena ke seo re se etsang.
This is to be yourself and to be sure.	Sena ke ho ba uena le ho ba le bonnete.
Take that as an opportunity.	Nka seo e le monyetla.
And nothing can.	'Me ha ho letho le ka khonang.
He is talking about us.	O bua ka rona.
That was a good thing.	E ne e le ntho e ntle eo.
Then he was trying to be beautiful.	Joale o ne a leka ho ba motle.
He never felt better.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ikutloa betere.
We do not want to see it happen again.	Ha re batle ho e bona e etsahala hape.
Some people live longer than others.	Batho ba bang ba phela nako e telele ho feta ba bang.
People will not understand us.	Batho ba ke ke ba re utloisisa.
she cried.	sa lla.
For enough to speak.	Bakeng sa ho lekana ho bua.
But it is the best thing we can do.	Empa ke ntho e molemo ka ho fetisisa eo re ka e etsang.
He wishes you were his girlfriend.	O lakatsa eka u ne u ntse u le ngoanana oa hae.
I was glad to know.	Ke ne ke thabela ho tseba.
This is what happened to some people.	Sena ke se etsahetseng ho batho ba bang.
This is a question.	Ena ke potso.
While waiting for their meal, they said nothing more.	Ha ba ntse ba emetse lijo tsa bona, ha baa ka ba bua ka letho la bohlokoa.
Writing has never been an issue.	Ho ngola ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba taba.
I hope it is true.	Ke tšepa hore ke 'nete.
It seems necessary then.	Ho bonahala ho hlokahala ka nako eo.
It is better to try them all.	Ho molemo ho li leka kaofela.
Finally, it can help the dog live longer.	Qetellong, e ka thusa ntja ho phela nako e telele.
Indeed, it is.	Ka sebele, ho joalo.
Everyone just stared.	Bohle ba ile ba sheba feela.
But there it is.	Empa ke eo.
Where it needed to stay.	Moo e neng e hloka ho lula teng.
I love your style.	Ke rata mokhoa oa hau.
My mother used to have it, and no one can have it again.	’Mè o kile a ba le eona, ’me ha ho motho ea ka bang le eona hape.
You hear us.	Ua re utloa.
However, he realizes something.	Leha ho le joalo, o hlokomela ho hong.
Of course, you can just ask them.	Ehlile, o ka ba kopa feela.
I learned.	Ke ile ka ithuta.
This seems to always return to the truth.	Sena se bonahala se khutlela 'nete kamehla.
But all in its time.	Empa tsohle ka nako ya teng.
My hearing went out.	Ho utloa ha ka ho ile ha tsoa.
This was beyond their work.	Sena se ne se feta mosebetsi oa bona.
They want to feel like you're trying.	Ba batla ho utloa eka oa leka.
He finally found what he was looking for.	Qetellong o ile a fumana seo a se batlang.
Just talk to me again.	O mpe o bue le nna hape.
He was arrested last night	O ile a tšoaroa bosiung ba maobane
Yes, they were.	E, ba ne ba le teng hape.
He let her go.	A mo tlohela.
Everyone can still say whatever they want.	E mong le e mong o ntse a ka bua eng kapa eng eo a e batlang.
I did not know him very well.	Ke ne ke sa mo tsebe hakaalo.
Stop coming out.	Tlohela ho tsoa.
He said he needed my help.	O itse o hloka thuso ea ka.
He was coming in, and obviously everyone knew who he was.	O ne a kena, mme ho hlakile hore bohle ba ne ba tseba hore na ke mang.
So it is you.	Kahoo ke uena.
He came from anywhere.	A tsoa kae kapa kae.
Who he really was.	Eo ka sebele a neng a le .
Soon, soon.	Haufinyane, haufinyane.
Being strong every day, just.	Ho ba matla letsatsi le letsatsi, feela.
We were not.	Re ne re se joalo.
But that was not the question.	Empa e ne e se eona potso.
So he could not speak or write the truth.	Kahoo o ne a sa khone ho bua kapa ho ngola 'nete.
Let's see if we can make some adjustments in that way.	A re bone hore na re ka lokisa lintho tse ling ka tsela eo.
I went to see them.	Ke ile ka ea ho bona.
No, he did not.	Che, o ne a sa lebala.
I loved when he was there.	Ke ne ke rata ha a le teng.
And more than once.	Le ho feta hang.
The same is true of the method he used.	Ho joalo le ka mokhoa oo a ileng a o sebelisa.
There is no question about that.	Haho potso ka seo.
They never understood it.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba utloisisa ka eona.
They need to know.	Ba hloka ho tseba.
The problem is that it works.	Bothata ke hore e ea sebetsa.
You did not understand my question.	Ha ua utloisisa potso ea ka.
The authorities handed the letter to the police.	Matla a fa mapolesa lengolo leo.
Most of them are for money and money only.	Tse ngata tsa tsona ke tsa chelete le chelete feela.
That took time.	Seo se ile sa nka nako.
Then everyone.	Ebe e mong le e mong.
He knew everything.	O ne a tseba tsohle.
No one has ever done that.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a etsa joalo.
Starting too late makes things even more fun.	Ho qala ka morao haholo ho etsa hore lintho li be monate le ho feta.
They were not expecting it.	Ba ne ba sa e lebella.
I do not like it.	ha ke e rate.
Yes, you heard right.	E, u utloile hantle.
He may seek her opinion as friends.	A ka batla maikutlo a hae e le metsoalle.
Finally we have it.	Qetellong re na le eona.
Still, it seemed to work.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho bonahala ho sebetsa.
If you do, you know what you did.	Haeba u etsa joalo, u tseba seo u se entseng.
I didn't want to think anymore.	Ke ne ke se ke sa batle ho nahana hape.
Thank you for being you.	Kea leboha ka ho ba uena.
He seemed to be the one talking.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ke eena ea tla bua.
Someone gives you food, you say yes.	Motho e mong o u fa lijo, uena u re e.
We all decided.	Kaofela re entse qeto.
I want to hear it from you.	Ke batla ho e utloa ho uena.
He had to stand.	O ne a lokela ho ema.
That's just true.	Ke 'nete feela.
This is where he started school.	Ke mona moo a ileng a qala ho kena sekolo.
They were waiting to hear about his condition.	Ba ne ba emetse ho utloa ka boemo ba hae.
Allow your husband his time without you.	Lumella monna oa hau nako ea hae ntle le uena.
Another girl was waiting for the call.	Ngoanana e mong o ne a emetse mohala.
I would take that team.	Ke ne ke tla nka sehlopha seo.
It would be him too.	E ne e tla ba eena hape.
We will do our best.	Re tla etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
It was just one picture.	E ne e le setšoantšo se le seng feela.
I realize that.	Ke hlokomela seo.
You have a place for everything and you love everything in its place.	U na le sebaka sa ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe 'me u rata ntho e' ngoe le e 'ngoe e sebakeng sa eona.
They look great.	Li shebahala hantle.
I think he just wanted her.	Ke nahana hore o ne a mo batla feela.
I know what it does.	Ke tseba seo e se etsang.
It goes with the work.	E tsamaea le mosebetsi.
I have never treated them like that.	Ha ke so ka ke ba tšoara joalo.
There it is.	Eona ke eo.
And then take it from there.	Mme ebe o e nka ho tloha moo.
That man won't have to come here.	Monna eo a ke ke a hloka ho tla mona.
His wife was away.	Mosali oa hae o ne a le sieo.
Find real friends who will tell you how they are.	Fumana metsoalle ea sebele e tla u bolella kamoo e leng kateng.
I am very tired.	Ke khathetse haholo.
She doesn't seem to be keeping the girl long.	Ha ho bonahale a boloka ngoanana nako e telele.
But, of course, they had it.	Empa, ho hlakile, ba ne ba e-na le eona.
The police are in danger.	Mapolesa a kotsing.
The other kids don't care anymore.	Bana ba bang le bona ha ba sa na taba.
I have things to do.	Ke na le lintho tseo ke lokelang ho li etsa.
But he saw nothing.	Empa ha aa ka a bona letho.
But you don't have much time for the rest.	Empa ha u na nako e telele ho tse ling.
I told you how you are.	Ke le boleletse hore na o joang.
Whether that risk is important to you.	Hore na kotsi eo ke ea bohlokoa ho uena.
That might catch a few people too.	Seo se ka 'na sa tšoara batho ba' maloa hape.
He is very simple.	O bonolo haholo.
They had time.	Ba ne ba ena le nako.
They plan to have more children.	Ba rera ho ba le bana ba bangata.
They became stronger.	Ba ile ba ba matla.
He had a good high school career.	O ne a e-na le mosebetsi o motle oa sekolo se phahameng.
We do not do this legally.	Ha re etse sena ka molao.
Then with the others.	Joale ka tse ling.
We do not decide what to think.	Ha re etse qeto ea hore na re tla nahana eng.
That is probably the fourth most important.	Eo mohlomong ke ea bone ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
I did not see anything important or do anything bad.	Ke ne ke sa bone letho la bohlokoa kapa ke etsa ntho leha e le efe e mpe.
That was his style.	E ne e le mokhoa oa hae oo.
Then you can go back to work.	Joale u ka khutlela mosebetsing.
I don't think I live anywhere.	Ha ke nahane hore ke lula kae kapa kae.
He made it for fun.	O e entse bakeng sa monate.
I had no idea how I would feel, what I hoped for.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na nka ikutloa joang, ke tšepa eng.
So at last the girl told them.	Kahoo, qetellong ngoanana eo o ile a ba bolella.
Think about the way you think.	Nahana ka mokhoa oa ho nahana.
I see you.	Kea u bona.
You don't really know how you think.	Ha o tsebe hakaalo kamoo o nahanang kateng.
They will not let it go either.	Le bona ba ke ke ba e tlohela.
I made coffee.	Ke entse kofi.
It's yours now.	Ke oa hau joale.
We certainly do not know this.	Ruri ha re tsebe sena.
However, it was very fun.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho le monate haholo.
There is something better for these people.	Ho na le ho hong ho molemo bakeng sa batho bana.
She sings beautifully.	O bina ha monate.
But he did it.	Empa o e entse.
Moreover, the truth is really hard.	Ho feta moo, 'nete e hlile e boima.
We went well.	Re ile ra tsamaea hantle.
Very well, you can come if you like.	Hantle haholo, o ka tla ha o rata.
I did not know where to look again.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na nka sheba hokae hape.
You can use it for everyday or work.	U ka e sebelisa bakeng sa letsatsi le letsatsi kapa mosebetsing.
They were real friends.	E ne e le metsoalle ea sebele.
I understand why you would want this to be the case.	Kea utloisisa hore na ke hobane'ng ha u ka batla hore sena se be joalo.
She’s a weird woman but she doesn’t think.	Ke mosali ea makatsang empa ha a nahane.
He obviously did not want to go in there.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a sa batle ho kena moo.
And it really does well.	'Me e hlile e etsa hantle.
I really enjoy that.	Ke thabela seo haholo.
I did not take long to think about it.	Ke ne ke sa nka nako e telele ho nahana ka eona.
No, I would not say that.	Che, nke ke ka bua joalo.
Or someone can.	Kapa motho a ka.
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha ea ka ea etsa joalo.
They did not have to.	Ho ne ho sa hlokahale hore ba be joalo.
It was not his business.	E ne e se taba ea hae.
I can't say anything.	Ha ke khone ho bua letho.
That is their only responsibility.	Eo ke mosebetsi oa bona feela.
And that is exactly what happened.	Mme ke sona se ileng sa etsahala.
We must stop and see.	Re tlameha ho ema re bone.
This is one of them.	Ena ke e 'ngoe ea tsona.
It takes a long time.	E nka nako e telele.
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
Then he could just stand.	Joale o ne a ka ema feela.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Mohlomong ke hobane o ne a se a ntse a tseba ka boemo bo itseng.
Name is a name.	Lebitso ke lebitso.
The water is very soft.	Metsi a bonolo haholo.
I could do nothing else.	Ke ne nke ke ka etsa letho le leng.
We would get it.	Re ne re tla e fumana.
They are right in front of us.	Ba ka pele ho rona hantle.
But he could get a little, hard, though.	Empa o ne a ka fumana hanyane, ho le thata, leha ho ne ho le joalo.
I do not understand this well.	Ha ke utloisise sena hantle.
Not so !!!.	Ha ho joalo !!!.
It was like that in his mind.	Ho ne ho le jwalo ka kelello ya hae.
You have decided now.	U entse qeto hona joale.
I will talk to my father.	Ke tla bua le ntate.
Sometimes it is not appropriate.	Ka linako tse ling ha ea lokela.
We looked for hours before he found out.	Re ile ra sheba lihora pele a fumana seo.
He was a lawyer and an expert.	E ne e le setsebi sa molao le setsebi.
I just ask them what they do before they go to bed.	Ke mpa ke ba botsa hore na ba etsa eng pele ba robala.
We play even more.	Re bapala le ho feta.
He was just doing his job.	O ne a etsa mosebetsi oa hae feela.
I really like it.	Ke e rata haholo.
However, they did not do this.	Leha ho le joalo, ha baa ka ba etsa sena.
But first you have to get there.	Empa pele u tlameha ho fihla moo.
And this is amazing.	Mme ke sena se makatsang.
It must have been a difficult time for them.	E tlameha ebe ho ne ho le thata ho bona.
I have another job for you.	Ke na le mosebetsi o mong bakeng sa hau.
More than ever before.	Ho feta kamoo ho kileng ha ba teng.
If anyone could help him, he certainly could.	Haeba mang kapa mang a ne a ka mo thusa, ka sebele o ne a ka khona.
They saw things, notice things.	Ba ne ba bona lintho, hlokomela lintho.
And he made his life.	Mme a etsa bophelo ba hae.
The work was enormous.	Mosebetsi o ne o le moholo haholo.
I have been using it ever since.	Haesale ke e sebelisa ho tloha ka nako eo.
We do the same thing.	Re etsa ntho e tšoanang.
This place was difficult.	Sebaka sena se ne se le thata.
He said, no one should drink and drive.	A re, ha ho motho ea lokelang ho noa le ho khanna.
Do them if you want to.	Li etse haeba u batla.
I got my first job.	Ke ile ka fumana mosebetsi oa pele.
I have not yet decided.	Ha ke so etse qeto.
I think it would be better if no one was.	Ke nahana hore ho ka ba molemo ha ho se motho.
His father loved him, and he knew.	Ntate oa hae o ne a mo rata, 'me o ne a tseba.
It is very difficult to maintain.	Ho thata haholo ho boloka.
I have that.	Ke na le seo.
I like to keep it simple, but make it nice.	Ke rata ho e boloka e le bonolo, empa etsa hore e be ntle.
He really wanted them.	Ha e le hantle o ne a li batla.
None of us said anything.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea ileng a bua letho.
But we must try.	Empa re tlameha ho leka.
They would not have done this.	Ba ka be ba sa ka ba etsa sena.
He stood up.	A ema ka maoto.
I left it at that to see what would happen next.	Ke ile ka e tlohela ho bona hore na ho tla etsahala eng ka mor'a moo.
And he knew that.	Mme o ne a tseba seo.
Most people do not know that.	Batho ba bangata ha ba tsebe seo.
, '.	, '.
That would be as bad as some people have it.	Seo se tla be se le mpe joalo ka ha batho ba bang ba na le sona.
Except he didn't go that night.	Ntle le hore ha a ka a ya bosiung boo.
He knew this well.	Sena o ne a se tseba hantle.
The only.	Eona feela.
But he does not need to know everything else.	Empa ha ho hlokahale hore a tsebe tse ling kaofela.
We must live by it.	Re tlameha ho phela ka eona.
Everyone tries to live every day.	Motho e mong le e mong o leka ho phela letsatsi le letsatsi.
You are not doing all you can.	Ha o etse sohle seo o ka se etsang.
I would have no problem finding a job there.	Nke ke ka ba le bothata ba ho fumana mosebetsi moo.
I get feedback.	Ke fumana maikutlo.
I just tried that and it seems to work.	Ke sa tsoa leka seo mme se bonahala se sebetsa.
I have no children.	Ha ke na bana.
It makes the process easier.	E etsa hore mokhoa oa ho sebetsa o be bonolo.
Allow enough time to move from one place to another.	Lumella nako e lekaneng ea ho tloha sebakeng se seng ho ea ho se seng.
There is nothing else for me.	Ha ho letho le leng bakeng sa ka.
You too.	Le uena 'na.
I think he still did not know.	Ke nahana hore leha ho le joalo o ne a sa tsebe.
I can't go anywhere without it.	Ha ke khone ho ea kae kapa kae ntle le eona.
I enjoyed being with her there.	Ke ile ka thabela ho ba le eena moo.
She only knew that she had a son.	O ne a tseba feela hore o na le mora.
Good value for money.	E ntle e lekana le chelete.
He would be near.	O ne a tla be a le haufi.
But he did not believe anything.	Empa ha ea ka ea lumela letho.
The more you work, the more you eat.	Ha u sebetsa haholo, u ja haholo.
But to me, they look just as they should.	Empa ho 'na, li shebahala hantle ka moo li lokelang.
I will study hard every day.	Ke tla ithuta ka thata letsatsi le leng le le leng.
They start singing as soon as they arrive.	Ba qala ho bina hang ha ba fihla.
Legally, you can’t keep him.	Ka molao, u ke ke ua mo boloka.
I'm very tired of that.	Ke khathetse haholo ke taba eo.
They come to you and know who you are.	Ba tla ho uena 'me baa tseba hore na u mang.
Sometimes he did not know what he really liked to do.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a sa tsebe hore na o rata ho etsa eng haholo.
All because you can.	Kaofela hobane u ka khona.
He was not sure where he was.	O ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na o hokae.
It was very close.	E ne e le haufi haholo.
He studied her carefully.	O ile a mo ithuta ka hloko.
They believe that anyone will inherit their family.	Ba lumela hore mang kapa mang o tla nka lefa la lelapa la bona.
You can even sleep in my house if you want.	U ka ba ua robala ha ka ha u batla.
None of them know here.	Haho le ya mong wa bona ya tsebang mona.
Simply put, they are the best of their kind.	Ka mokhoa o bonolo, ke tsona tse ntle ka ho fetisisa tsa mofuta oa tsona.
There was something.	Ho bile le ho hong.
I knew how to work there.	Ke ne ke tseba ho sebetsa moo.
Finding a place has been difficult.	Ho fumana sebaka ho bile thata.
It could be even worse.	E ka ba mpe le ho feta.
And we won’t know in any way, though.	'Me re ke ke ra tseba ka tsela efe kapa efe, leha ho le joalo.
They are mine.	Ke tsa ka.
This will not stand.	Sena se ke ke sa ema.
He graduated from school this year.	O ile a qeta sekolong selemong sena.
That was his first mistake.	Eo e bile phoso ea hae ea pele.
I can buy new clothes.	Nka reka liaparo tse ncha.
But it still exists.	Empa leha ho le joalo e ntse e le teng.
That's not right.	Ha se hantle ka seo.
Hours, he thought.	Lihora, a nahana.
Some may not be able to.	Ba bang ba ka 'na ba se ke ba khona.
However, people cannot.	Leha ho le joalo, batho ha ba khone.
There was something wrong with them.	Ho ne ho e-na le phoso ka bona.
You can have them if you want them.	U ka ba le tsona haeba u li batla.
He was not looking at her.	O ne a sa mo sheba.
He was an only child.	E ne e le ngoana a le mong.
Will we walk?	A na re tla tsamaea ka maoto?
Take it as you like.	Nka kamoo u ratang kateng.
Always look good.	Sheba se setle kamehla.
It's hard to see.	Ho thata ho bona.
Then you can play with everything you have done.	Joale o ka bapala ka tsohle tseo o li entseng.
I do not want you here.	Ha ke o batle mona.
There is no way behind it.	Ha ho na mokhoa o ka morao ho eona.
He asked questions.	O ile a botsa lipotso.
So they can't meet.	Kahoo ha li khone ho kopana.
Do your best.	E etse matla a hao.
he says.	o re.
However, it does not matter now.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho na taba le hona joale.
It was nice to meet you.	Ho ne ho le monate ho kopana le wena.
We worked hard to find her.	Re ile ra sebetsa ka thata ho mo fumana.
I want to continue.	Ke batla ho tsoela pele.
His father is my father.	Ntate oa hae ke ntate oa ka.
No one will notice anything wrong.	Ha ho motho ea tla hlokomela letho le phoso.
Perhaps some did.	Mohlomong ba bang ba ile ba etsa joalo.
However, I did not try to take a picture of it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha kea ka ka leka ho nka setšoantšo sa eona.
He thinks wrong.	O nahana phoso.
They are friends now.	Ke metsoalle hona joale.
You can learn quickly.	U ka ithuta kapele.
I wanted to do it.	Ke ne ke batla ho e etsa.
She enjoys being there.	O thabela ho ba teng.
I just say.	Ke re feela.
The worst guesses will happen.	Ho nahana tse mpe ka ho fetisisa ho tla etsahala.
I have a problem.	Ke fumane bothata.
That is why we are here.	Ke ka lebaka leo re leng mona.
And as you say, he never wrote much.	'Me ha u ntse u re, ha ho mohla a kileng a ngola haholo.
It would not help, he thought.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha thusa, a nahana.
It is not enough to say.	Ha hoa lekana ho bua.
Take whatever you need from me.	Nka eng kapa eng eo o e hlokang ho nna.
That has been the case so far.	Ho bile joalo ho fihlela joale.
I need to fix it.	Ke hloka ho e lokisa.
Sometimes he caught her.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a mo tšoara.
Man right here is something new to me.	Monna hantle mona ke ntho e ncha ho nna.
Sometimes simplicity is important.	Ka linako tse ling ho ba bonolo hoa bohlokoa.
You may find it difficult to get another job.	U ka fumana ho le thata ho fumana mosebetsi o mong.
Maybe even more.	Mohlomong le ho feta.
You do not have to do anything!	Ha ho hlokahale hore u etse letho!
It's not that easy.	Ha ho bonolo hakaalo.
They have to buy together to stay together.	E tlameha ho reka hammoho ho lula hammoho.
The baby had never been injured.	Ngoana o ne a e-s'o ka a tsoa kotsi.
This made it even easier.	Sena se ile sa etsa hore ho be bonolo le ho feta.
Maybe books are available.	Mohlomong libuka li teng.
There were no police officers at the time.	Ho ne ho se na mapolesa ka nako eo.
There are other issues.	Ho na le litaba tse ling.
I had so much to say.	Ke ne ke e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo nka li buang.
Stay well together.	Lula hantle kaofela.
Which is what they thought.	E leng seo ba neng ba se nahana.
I know you can walk for so long.	Kea tseba hore le ka tsamaea ka nako e telele hakaalo.
Where you want to be.	Moo u batlang ho ba teng.
The softness of her hair.	Bonolo ba moriri oa hae.
They were just trying to help.	Ba ne ba leka ho thusa feela.
She did not want to say these things to her child.	O ne a sa batle ho bua lintho tsena ho ngoana oa hae.
But important.	Empa ea bohlokoa.
I can't drink or eat.	Ha ke khone ho noa kapa ho ja.
Yet it really does its job.	Leha ho le joalo e hlile e etsa mosebetsi oa eona.
I like your feedback.	Ke rata maikutlo a hau.
It takes a lot of hard work.	Ho hloka mosebetsi o boima haholo.
For not being good enough.	Bakeng sa ho se be motle ka ho lekaneng.
He was always the one to say please and thank you.	O ne a lula e le motho oa ho re ke kopa le ho leboha.
Or maybe he didn't.	Kapa mohlomong o ne a se jwalo.
Yet we do not see it.	Leha ho le joalo ha re e bone.
Maybe better than, you know, whoever did it first.	Mohlomong ho molemo ho feta, ua tseba, mang kapa mang ea entseng pele.
I must but thirty years is a long time.	Ke tlameha empa lilemo tse mashome a mararo ke nako e telele.
He wants to help.	O batla ho thusa.
But now that is not the case.	Empa hona joale ha ho joalo.
This is a strange thing.	Sena ke ntho e makatsang.
No one really knew what was going to happen.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba hantle hore na ho tla etsahala eng.
Maybe he can.	Mohlomong a ka khona.
I need someone like that.	Ke hloka motho ea joalo.
Everyone had heard theirs.	E mong le e mong o ne a utloile tsa hae.
Do not just hear the news.	U se ke ua utloa feela litaba tsa seo a se buang.
If you think you can play, you can play.	Haeba u nahana hore u ka bapala, u ka bapala.
He knows you.	O a o tseba.
We meet for breakfast from time to time, to have coffee.	Re kopana bakeng sa lijo tsa hoseng nako le nako, ho ea noa kofi.
Be it one morning tomorrow morning.	Eba hoseng ho hong hosane hoseng.
They tell us.	Ba re bolella.
Life is real.	Bophelo ke ba sebele.
And it still is.	Mme ho ntse ho le jwalo.
This was their weapon.	Sena e ne e le sebetsa sa bona.
I really was.	Ke ne ke hlile ke le joalo.
That's what they had to do.	Ke seo ba neng ba lokela ho se etsa.
To do these things, you have to be healthy.	Ho etsa lintho tsena, u tlameha ho phela hantle.
I never understand why, either.	Le ka mohla ha ke utloisise lebaka, le hona.
Each place has its own food.	Sebaka ka seng se na le lijo tsa sona.
I would not think of asking you to do what you did.	Ke ne nke ke ka nahana ho u kopa hore u etse seo u se entseng.
He was very happy.	O ne a thabile haholo.
It was the first time she had seen him.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele a mo bona.
But it was there.	Empa e ne e le teng.
She cried when she heard the news.	O ile a lla ha a utloa litaba tseo.
However, he is not sure.	Leha ho le joalo, ha a na bonnete.
It's a silly question.	Ke potso e hlokang kelello.
Nothing good happens.	Ha ho letho le molemo le etsahalang.
You could eat and do whatever you wanted.	U ne u ka ja u etsa eng kapa eng.
It means you know what you want.	Ho bolela hore o tseba seo o se batlang.
Then they looked at it together.	Eaba ba e sheba hammoho.
I do.	Ke etsa joalo.
You were the only one who understood before.	Ke uena feela ea neng a utloisisa pele.
He needed a way out.	O ne a hloka tsela ea ho tsoa.
And it was fun.	Mme ho ne ho le monate.
They were very fun.	Li bile monate haholo.
It takes place.	Ho nka sebaka.
From location.	Ho tloha sebakeng.
She has been very good.	O bile hantle haholo.
No one will enjoy that.	Ha ho motho ea tla thabela seo.
The room was very nice.	Kamore eo e ne e le ntle haholo.
They were beautiful, but they were not so good.	Li ne li le ntle, empa li ne li se molemo hakaalo.
Kick ass.	E monate haholo.
I do not want to understand this.	Ha ke batle ho utloisisa taba ena.
I can't stay home today.	Ha ke khone ho lula hae kajeno.
I feel happy.	Ke ikutloa ke thabile.
That's where he wanted to be.	Ke hona moo a neng a batla ho ba teng.
I am very skeptical of this.	Ke belaela haholo taba ena.
And he did not expect that to happen.	Mme o ne a sa lebella hore seo se tla etsahala.
I kept thinking about it.	Ke ile ka lula ke nahana ka eona.
Besides, he did nothing.	Ntle ho moo, ha aa ka a etsa letho.
When you are strong.	Ha o le matla.
He just fixed it.	O sa tsoa e lokisa.
However, those things were not my problem.	Leha ho le joalo, lintho tseo e ne e se bothata ba ka.
It's a festival day.	Ke mokete oa mokete.
There was no need for a husband even though there were many who offered.	Ho ne ho sa hloke monna le hoja ho ne ho e-na le ba bangata ba neng ba fana.
Surprisingly, it was true.	Ho makatsang ke hore e ne e le 'nete.
I hope you will too.	Ke tšepa hore le uena u tla etsa joalo.
I'm sure he doesn't.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ha a etse joalo.
Although that may help.	Le hoja mohlomong seo se thusa.
I've been there before.	Ke bile moo pele.
Thinking about life and living life.	Ho nahana ka bophelo le ho phela bophelo.
I'm not really here.	Ha ke mona ka 'nete.
Then he stopped.	Eaba oa ema.
However, we did what we could throughout the house.	Leha ho le joalo, re ile ra etsa seo re ka se khonang ka ntlo eohle.
I want the same for my baby.	Ke batla se tšoanang bakeng sa ngoana oa ka.
I will be ahead.	Ke tla ba ka pele.
Always three well.	Kamehla tse tharo hantle.
But this is not the case here.	Empa mona ha ho joalo.
It happens often.	E etsahala hangata.
I can give you good money for that.	Nka u fa chelete e ntle ka seo.
It can do it.	E ka e etsa.
That's the name you speak.	Ke lebitso leo u le buang.
During this time, he needed more money than anything else.	Nakong ena, o ne a hloka chelete ho feta ntho leha e le efe.
They decided to leave.	Ba etsa qeto ea ho tloha.
But it is worse than before.	Empa e mpe le ho feta pele.
Thank you for being here.	Ke ile ka leboha hore ebe o teng mona.
However, everyone knows.	Leha ho le joalo, bohle baa tseba.
So that really goes well.	Kahoo seo se hlile se tsamaea hantle.
They can be.	Ba ka ba joalo.
His friends agree.	Metsoalle ea hae ea e lumela.
Usually, the whole area had only one phone line.	Hangata, sebaka sohle se ne se e-na le mohala o le mong feela oa mohala.
We were really very close.	Re ne re hlile re le haufi haholo.
A lot.	E ngata.
He is still in the morning.	O sa le hoseng.
That is our problem.	Ke bona bothata ba rona.
It will have to see.	E tla tlameha ho bona.
Thank you.	Kea leboha.
He loved my mother and mother and he loved her.	O ne a rata mme wa ka mme mme a mo rata.
And in place.	Le sebakeng.
Thank you both very much.	Ke le leboha ka bobeli haholo.
He is very good to us.	O molemo haholo ho rona.
But it was powerful and very powerful.	Empa e ne e le matla mme e le matla haholo.
But we do not want to get to know them better.	Empa ha re batle ho e tseba ka hloko.
It has been, and will continue to be, for a long time.	E bile, 'me e tla tsoela pele ho ba, nako e telele.
They sleep on the floor as a rule.	Ba robala fatše e le molao.
You can find him in that.	O ka mo fumana ho seo.
At first you didn't care.	Pele o ne o sa tsotelle.
You need a place soon.	U hloka sebaka haufinyane.
He seemed to think about it.	E ne e bonahala e nahana ka eona.
I want to start playing.	Ke batla ho qala ho bapala.
We need to think about our children.	Re lokela ho nahana ka bana ba rona.
Some people came quickly to hear the news.	Batho ba bang ba ile ba tla kapele ho tla utloa litaba.
There really is no way it can be.	Ka sebele ha ho tsela eo e ka bang ka eona.
I have to finish the job.	Ke tlameha ho qeta mosebetsi.
I would just spend the evening alone.	Nka mpa ka qeta mantsiboea ke le mong.
Yes, that is what he wanted.	Ee, ke sona seo a neng a se batla.
I have seen.	Ke bone.
I really feel strong.	Ka sebele ke ikutloa ke le matla.
This is not bedtime.	Ena hase nako ea ho robala.
That is why he was asking for time.	Ke kahoo a neng a kopa nako.
It was something.	E ne e le ntho e itseng.
That was the second problem.	Eo e ne e le bothata ba bobeli.
I know they will enjoy this.	Kea tseba hore ba tla thabela sena.
Because it is a betrayal.	Hobane ke ho eka.
They can get that.	Ba ka fumana seo.
She is usually beautiful.	Hangata o motle.
He did exactly what he had to do.	O ile a etsa hantle seo a neng a lokela ho se etsa.
I had no idea looking at him.	Ke ne ke sa nahane ho mo sheba.
He doesn't know how to fix me.	Ha a tsebe ho lokisa 'na.
It will benefit us in the long run, in the long run.	O tla re tsoela molemo ka nako e telele, e telele.
And he finished.	Mme a qeta.
Like you, it's beautiful.	Joalo ka uena, e motle.
Write down what happened.	Ngola se etsahetseng.
Kind of nice, of course.	Mofuta o motle, ehlile.
Legs with front arms back.	Maoto ka pele matsoho morao.
What they needed was the kind of help we could give them.	Seo ba neng ba se hloka e ne e le mofuta oa thuso eo re neng re ka ba fa eona.
You should not talk about bad things.	Ha ua lokela ho bua ka lintho tse mpe.
That was his idea, you know.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo wa hae, le a tseba.
I did this with the help of this question.	Ke entse sena ka thuso ea potso ena.
He had his problems.	O ne a e-na le mathata a hae.
I will never go the same way again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke tsamaea ka tsela e tšoanang.
I thought that was what he was going to do.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke seo a tla se etsa.
The night was clear.	Bosiu bo ne bo hlakile.
This will make it easier to use.	Sena se tla etsa hore ho be bonolo ho se sebelisa.
Or so he thought.	Kapa o ne a nahana joalo.
You have to think.	U tlameha ho nahana.
He wants to be alone, he knows.	O batla a le mong, o ya tseba.
He doesn't know why he says that.	Ha a tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a bua joalo.
He had his job to see them again.	O ne a e-na le mosebetsi oa hae ho bona hape.
It had many hours in it.	E ne e na le lihora tse ngata ho eona.
Soon it will be our time.	Haufinyane e tla ba nako ea rona.
Only those closest to them could see it.	Ke ba neng ba le haufi haholo feela ba neng ba li bona.
Because of this situation, he was skeptical.	Ka lebaka la boemo bona, o ne a belaela.
His food is delicious.	Lijo tsa hae li monate.
This has been the time of my life.	Ena e bile nako ea bophelo ba ka.
I'm glad we did.	Ke thabela hore ebe rea e etsa.
He goes further than anything he does.	O tsoela pele ho feta ho tsohle tseo a li etsang.
It could be anything else.	E ka ba eng hape.
I was there to cry with her and to feel her pain.	Ke ne ke bile teng ho lla le eena le ho utloa bohloko ba hae.
You have one chance.	O na le monyetla o le mong.
And more back.	Le ho feta morao.
There was a dog.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntja .
Then we went to bed.	Eaba re ea robala.
He had never loved anyone.	O ne a eso ka a rata motho e mong.
For now.	Bakeng sa hona joale.
There was only one way to get started.	Ho ne ho e-na le mokhoa o le mong feela oa ho qala.
But he never seemed to have enough.	Empa ha ho mohla ho neng ho bonahala eka o na le ho lekaneng.
The best of.	Molemo ka ho fetisisa oa.
There was nothing else that needed to be there.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng le hlokang ho ba moo.
It was the first time we had met.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele re kopana.
We met first.	Re kopane pele.
He was in this for himself and his team only.	O ne a le ho sena bakeng sa hae le sehlopha sa hae feela.
I hope it helps someone.	Ke tšepa hore e thusa motho.
Yes, he enjoyed his work.	E, o ne a thabela mosebetsi oa hae.
We can only hope that someone has heard.	Re ka tšepa feela hore motho o utloile.
However, it is fun to watch.	Leha ho le joalo, ho monate ho shebella.
And that he needed my help.	Le hore o ne a hloka thuso ea ka.
But it did not work well.	Empa ha ea ka ea sebetsa hantle.
This is really strange.	Sena ke ntho e makatsang ruri.
It is not just us and them.	Ha se rona feela le rona.
There is nothing he can love more than.	Ha ho letho leo a ka le ratang ho feta.
That is a very good question.	Eo ke potso e ntle haholo.
In the morning she felt better.	Hoseng a ikutloa a le betere.
We used to be close.	Re kile ra ba haufi.
He didn't talk much while we ate.	O ne a sa bue haholo ha re ntse re ja.
That first week was really hard.	Beke eo ea pele e ne e hlile e le boima.
Come back soon.	Khutla haufinyane.
The present tense.	Nako ea joale.
Maybe you know something about it.	Mohlomong o tseba ho hong ka eona.
They can be several years and many hours.	Ba ka ba le lilemo tse 'maloa le lihora tse ngata.
He is a tough kid and loves to meet.	Ke ngoana ea thata 'me o rata ho kopana.
She was crying now.	O ne a ntse a lla jwale.
It's just a matter of fact.	Ke taba ea 'nete feela.
I could not sleep.	Ha kea khona ho robala.
That is very dangerous.	Seo se kotsi haholo.
They are very fun.	Li monate haholo.
You know how to live in that moment.	U tseba ho phela nakong eo.
It was a wonderful night.	E ne e le bosiu bo monate.
He said thank you for your help.	A re ke leboha thuso.
To be close to it and.	Ho ba haufi le eona le.
Many people had told many people.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba boleletse batho ba bangata.
And you know it.	Mme o a e tseba.
Why, we have never been able to find out.	Ka eng, ha ho mohla re kileng ra khona ho tseba.
I was close enough to hear it.	Ke ne ke le haufi ho lekana ho e utloa.
Such good news.	Litaba tse monate joalo.
Or maybe he did some bad thing.	Kapa mohlomong o ile a etsa lintho tse mpe.
I will never forget that.	Nke ke ka lebala seo.
But there seems to be something wrong.	Empa ho bonahala eka ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
He was learning more and thinking about everything.	O ne a ithuta ho feta mme a nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
I get a call.	Ke fumana mohala.
It will not be the last time.	E ke ke ea e-ba lekhetlo la ho qetela.
However, he needs your help.	Leha ho le joalo, o hloka thuso ea hau.
Now it goes on.	Joale e ntse e tsoela pele.
You have to save that time.	U tlameha ho boloka nako eo.
Then my mother called.	Eaba ’Mè oa letsa.
I asked myself a simple question.	Ke ile ka ipotsa potso e bonolo feela.
Be weter than ever.	E-ba metsi ho feta leha e le neng pele.
Of course, we do not want to use them.	Ha e le hantle, ha re batle ho li sebelisa.
The money was there.	Chelete e ne e le teng.
When we start.	Ha re qala.
Then he fell asleep.	Eaba o robala.
I don’t think about anyone.	Ha ke nahane ka mang kapa mang.
I'm working to get it.	Ke ntse ke sebetsa ho e fumana.
See if you need it.	Bona hore na ua e hloka.
They made you unhealthy.	Ba entse hore o se ke wa phela hantle.
You will not be healthy.	U ke ke ua phela hantle.
I'm not sure what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke eng.
Use enough water.	Sebelisa metsi a lekaneng.
The woman seemed happy.	Mosali eo o ne a bonahala a thabile.
Yet we do nothing.	Leha ho le joalo ha re etse letho.
He was outside the house.	O ne a le ka ntle ho ntlo eo.
You have to stop.	O lokela ho ema.
They begin to doubt.	Ba qala ho belaela.
He stood there thinking.	A ema moo a nahana feela.
I really enjoyed it.	Ke ile ka e thabela haholo.
He loved her very much.	O ne a mo rata haholo.
So they live one day at a time.	Kahoo ba phela letsatsi le le leng ka nako.
Finally I was able to sleep.	Qetellong ke ile ka khona ho robala.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
He can do the same.	Le eena a ka etsa joalo.
Your hands start to hurt.	Matsoho a hao a qala ho utloa bohloko.
I didn't have to tell him.	Ke ne ke sa tlameha ho mo bolella.
Life is now.	Bophelo ke jwale.
That is the day.	Ke letsatsi leo.
He had never done that before.	O ne a eso ho ka a etsa hoo pele.
Of course we knew him.	Ehlile re ne re mo tseba.
He did that.	O entse seo.
I still think we have that.	Ke ntse ke nahana hore re na le seo.
Only, that is what he needed.	Feela, ke sona seo e neng e se hloka.
I wonder if he saw something that made him walk away.	Kea ipotsa hore na ebe o bone ntho e mo entseng hore a tsamaee.
We have a dinner party tonight.	Re na le mokete oa lijo tsa mantsiboea bosiung bona.
It's an easy thing for me.	Ke ntho e bonolo ho 'na.
You know exactly.	U tseba hantle.
He may have left immediately.	E ka 'na eaba o ile a tsamaea kapele ka nako eo.
It seemed too old.	E ne eka ke khale haholo.
How long will we stay there?	Re tla lula moo ho fihlela neng?
The morning passes.	Hoseng hoa feta.
But something must have happened.	Empa e tlameha ebe ho na le ntho e etsahetseng.
I know everyone is busy.	Kea tseba hore bohle ba phathahane.
And she took one of mine.	Mme o nkile e mong wa ka.
So it is better to have some money than to have nothing.	Kahoo o molemo ho ba le chelete e itseng ho feta ho se be le letho.
If you do not have it you will not understand it.	Haeba u se na eona u ke ke ua e utloisisa.
However, we have some really fun toys.	Leha ho le joalo, re na le lintho tsa ho bapala tse monate haholo.
I did not know why, but that did not matter.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe lebaka, empa hoo ho ne ho se taba.
It's almost as bad as it could be.	E batla e le mpe ka moo e ka bang teng.
More than other people.	Ho feta batho ba bang.
I did not mention them.	Ha kea bua ka tsona.
Then we will have time to think about what to do.	Joale re tla ba le nako ea ho nahana hore na re etse eng.
Maybe it's just something that exists.	Mohlomong ke ntho feela e teng.
We need to do something about it.	Re lokela ho etsa ho hong ka seo.
Does anyone have any questions?	Ho na le motho ea nang le lipotso?
But in reality, it is not.	Empa ha e le hantle, ha ho joalo.
He didn't know what he did, just exactly.	O ne a sa tsebe se entseng, hantle feela.
It was going well to the end.	E ne e tsamaea hantle ho fihlela qetellong.
He thought and thought.	A nahana le ho nahana.
The problem is that they are not.	Bothata ke hore ha ba joalo.
There was no sense.	Ho ne ho se na maikutlo.
I want to finish with a book.	Ke batla ho qeta ka buka.
I want them to know that.	Ke batla hore ba tsebe seo.
If he does, he can win.	Ha a ka etsa jwalo, a ka hlola.
I should talk to you in a few days.	Ke lokela ho bua le uena ka mor'a matsatsi a 'maloa.
That may not necessarily mean that you should help.	Seo se ka 'na sa se ke sa bolela hore u lokela ho thusa.
Many and one.	Ba bangata le e 'ngoe.
That was good, but it was still not enough.	Seo se ne se le molemo, empa se ne se ntse se sa lekana.
In fact, most people are afraid of it.	Ha e le hantle, batho ba bangata baa ba tšaba.
I am sure it will be so.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ho tla ba joalo.
Nobody does, really.	Ha ho motho ea etsang, ka 'nete.
I knew the area well.	Ke ne ke tseba sebaka seo hantle.
I got the first call.	Ke fumane mohala oa pele.
Or he may realize that the first one was his.	Kapa, ​​​​a ka 'na a hlokomela hore ea pele e ne e le ea hae.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
He does not have much money.	Ha a na chelete e ngata.
And you will never know the truth.	'Me u ke ke ua tseba 'nete.
I'll see if you can see it.	Ke tla bona hore na o tla o bona.
I never took it again, because of that.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke e nka, ka lebaka la seo.
The team loves him.	Sehlopha sea mo rata.
I'm not sure, and neither do you.	Ha ke tsebe hantle, mme le lona ruri ha le tsebe.
He always takes the same path to work.	Kamehla o nka tsela e tšoanang ho ea mosebetsing.
I asked if he did this.	Ke ile ka botsa hore na o entse tsena.
Someone called my mom tonight and told her about us.	Motho e mong o ile a letsetsa ’Mè bosiung bona ’me a mo bolella ka rōna.
This is my favorite image.	Sena ke setšoantšo seo ke se ratang haholo.
The house is next door.	Ntlo e haufi le eo.
It was as if he knew something.	E ne eka e tseba ho hong.
I think he wanted books.	Ke nahana hore o ne a batla libuka.
Anyway, I really like it.	Joalo, ke e rata haholo.
You have to talk to me about it.	U tlameha ho bua le 'na ka eona.
Please come in if you don't mind.	Ke kopa ho kena ha le sa tsotelle.
To do that.	Ho etsa seo.
You and I, here, can do that.	Nna le wena, mona, re ka etsa seo.
We were so happy that we could not sleep that night.	Re ne re thabile hoo re neng re ke ke ra robala bosiung boo.
From then on, it became easier.	Ho tloha ka nako eo ho ea pele, ho ba bonolo.
I believe it is possible.	Ke lumela hore ho ka etsahala.
The days go by.	Matsatsi a ntse a feta.
I will never take it again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke e nka.
It would work well.	E ne e tla sebetsa hantle.
I do not find fault.	Ha ke fumane phoso.
It was a good thing he didn’t have to get.	E ne e le ntho e ntle eo a neng a sa tlameha ho e fumana.
I've always said that.	Haesale ke bolela seo.
It could not continue in the same way.	E ne e ke ke ea tsoela pele ka tsela e tšoanang.
You are no longer holding.	Ha u sa tšoara.
Or maybe they see what you know.	Kapa mohlomong ba bona seo u se tsebang.
He was not even sure if he could say anything.	O ne a se na bonnete le hore na a ka bua letho.
He did not do so.	Ha aa ka a etsa joalo.
Almost too long.	Hoo e ka bang nako e telele haholo.
You might look at them.	U ka 'na ua li sheba.
There was nothing that we could do.	Ho ne ho se letho leo re neng re ka le etsa.
You start to think.	U qala ho nahana.
What he thought he had done.	Seo a neng a nahana hore o se entse.
It's been too long.	E se e le nako e telele haholo.
Each good one.	Molemo o le mong ka mong.
At the same time.	Ka nako e tšoanang.
It was very important.	E ne e le ea bohlokoa haholo.
She loves school and has to go.	O rata sekolo mme o tlameha ho ea.
You said you could.	U itse u ka khona.
Nice to see you.	Ke thabela ho o bona.
So that's what this is all about.	Kahoo ke seo sena se leng sona.
His mind was filled with pain.	Kelello ea hae e ile ea tšoaroa ke bohloko.
You could have done the same.	Le uena u ka be u entse se tšoanang.
She doesn't seem to have any friends.	Ho bonahala a se na metsoalle.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
Something wonderful happened.	Ho ile ha etsahala ntho e makatsang.
Someone stopped to help.	Motho e mong o ile a ema ho thusa.
We can try that here.	Re ka leka seo mona.
Pain is an emotion.	Bohloko ke maikutlo.
I was not mistaken.	Ke ne ke sa etsa phoso.
He knew he could refuse.	O ne a tseba hore a ka hana.
After eating, he fell asleep tired.	Ka mor’a ho ja, o ile a robala a khathetse.
We don't just think about it.	Ha re e nahane feela.
I can do something for you.	Nka u etsetsa ho hong.
Or whatever you all think will be the best.	Kapa eng kapa eng eo bohle le nahanang hore e tla ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
There seemed to be no way out of it.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se mokhoa oa ho tsoa ho eona.
Then came the first book.	Eaba ho tsoa buka ea pele.
I know people who helped.	Ke tseba batho ba ileng ba thusa.
It might have been a good idea to stand up.	E ka 'na eaba e bile molemo oa ho ema.
Can I use one more than the other.	A na nka sebelisa e 'ngoe ho feta e' ngoe.
I think it was about something else.	Ke nahana hore e ne e bua ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
You certainly do not.	Ka sebele ha u etse joalo.
I think sleeping too much at night is not good.	Ke nahana hore ho robala bosiu haholo ha ho molemo.
She does not know which one she will need.	Ha a tsebe hore na a ka hloka efe ho tsena.
The point should be to make money on it.	Taba e lokela ho ba ho etsa chelete ho eona.
Doing the right thing would not be easy.	Ho etsa hantle ho ne ho ke ke ha e-ba bonolo.
Moreover, they move very fast.	Ho feta moo, li tsamaea kapele haholo.
It seems to be much better.	Ho bonahala eka ke betere haholo.
She cared for him for years.	O ile a mo hlokomela ka lilemo.
Or we think so, though.	Kapa re nahana joalo, leha ho le joalo.
But we do not know who he is or where he comes from.	Empa ha re tsebe hore na ke mang le hore na o tsoa hokae.
It was mine now.	E ne e le ea ka joale.
I hope to hear from you again.	Ke tšepa ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena hape.
The car was nearby.	Koloi e ne e le haufi.
Of course, when you want a final decision.	Ha e le hantle, ha u batla qeto ea ho qetela.
I tried to imagine what it would be like.	Ke ile ka leka ho nahana hore na ho ka ba joang.
I even met others.	Ke bile ke kopane le ba bang.
He did not understand what was going on.	O ne a sa utloisise se etsahalang.
Something very similar to the previous three.	Ntho e tšoanang hantle le tse tharo tse fetileng.
We expected the job to be easy.	Re ne re lebeletse hore mosebetsi o be bonolo.
What, he did not know.	Ke eng, o ne a sa tsebe.
They both make things better.	Ka bobeli li etsa hore lintho li be ntle.
There may be more or less.	Ho ka ba le tse ling tse ngata kapa tse ngata.
I can't even.	Ha ke khone le.
But just take him.	Empa mo nke feela.
However, we should not do that.	Leha ho le joalo, ha rea ​​lokela ho etsa joalo.
Neither the first nor the second method worked.	Ha ho tsela ea pele kapa ea bobeli e ileng ea sebetsa.
And we need to do more than that.	Mme re hloka ho etsa ho feta moo.
This is a strange thing.	Sena ke ntho e makatsang.
My parents are there to help out when needed.	Batsoali ba ka ba teng ho thusa ha ho hlokahala.
It all seems to come together.	Tsohle li bonahala li kopane.
He could not leave her alone.	O ne a ke ke a mo tlohela a le mong.
The house next door was empty.	Ntlo e haufi e ne e se na motho.
She uses her hands.	O sebelisa matsoho a hae.
Maybe you slept late last night.	Mohlomong u ile ua robala bosiu haholo maobane.
It's a strange head.	Ke hlooho e makatsang.
I did not understand that.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise seo.
I asked if she needed any help.	Ke ile ka botsa hore na o hloka thuso leha e le efe.
They say it's a legal matter.	Ba re ke taba ea molao.
There are many more to go.	Ho na le ba bang ba bangata ba lokelang ho tsamaea.
I will know you.	Ke tla o tseba.
It should not just happen.	Ha ea lokela ho etsahala feela.
He is talking to me.	O bua le nna.
He did not know who he was or where he had found him.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke mang kapa a mo fumane hokae hape.
I wanted it to do almost everything you can think of.	Ke ne ke batla hore e etse hoo e batlang e le ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo u ka e nahanang.
However he was not sure.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a sa tsebe hantle.
They go because they go.	Ba tsamaea hobane ba tsamaea.
Thank you for commenting on the wonderful books!	Kea leboha ka ho fana ka maikutlo a monate a libuka!
Probably too many.	Mohlomong tse ngata haholo.
Indeed, they are.	Ka sebele, ba joalo.
His first injury.	Kotsi ea hae ea pele.
It's not too late, you know.	Ha e-so be morao haholo, ua tseba.
I've seen it happen many times.	Ke e bone e etsahala hangata.
They refuse to enter the room.	Ba hana ho kena ka phaposing.
The second person leaves and the first one returns.	Motho oa bobeli oa tsamaea ’me oa pele oa khutla.
It is important to us.	E bohlokoa ho rona.
She looked very happy, very much so.	O ne a shebahala a thabile haholo, haholo.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
After that she did not say much to him.	Ka mor'a moo ha aa ka a bua haholo le eena.
Finding his way.	Ho fumana tsela ya hae.
I know something is going to happen.	Kea tseba hore ho tla etsahala ntho e itseng.
We helped him in his work.	Re ile ra mo thusa mosebetsing oa hae.
I have one here.	Ke na le e 'ngoe mona.
I need a new way.	Ke hloka tsela e ncha.
We must take advantage of it.	Re lokela ho nka monyetla ka eona.
You will get out of here.	U tla tsoa mona.
I only saw her yesterday.	Ke mo bone maobane feela.
So except for one of the first times.	Kahoo ntle le e 'ngoe ea makhetlo a pele.
This is our starting point.	Ena ke sebaka sa rona sa ho qala.
This is more true than the law.	Ena ke 'nete ho feta molao.
There is nothing better.	Ha ho letho le betere.
I did it one after the other.	Ke ile ka e etsa ka mor'a e 'ngoe hape.
He’s a player of my type.	Ke sebapali sa mofuta oa ka.
I don't want to get back.	Ha ke batle ho fihla morao.
It's mine, you know.	Ke ea ka, ua tseba.
Probably because of my age.	Mohlomong ka lebaka la lilemo tsa ka.
I don't like it here.	Ha ke e rate mona.
I did not expect that to happen.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore ho ka ba joalo.
He felt the strongest now.	O ne a ikutloa a le matla ka ho fetisisa hona joale.
You were just naked.	U ne u le feela.
This is a great place for a great place.	Sena ke sebaka se setle sebakeng se setle.
And they do not.	Mme hape ha ba etse jwalo.
He did it every morning when he returned home.	O ne a e etsa hoseng ho hong le ho hong ha a khutlela hae.
It's hard to see.	Ho thata ho bona.
Time was moving fast all the time.	Nako e ne e tsamaea kapele ka linako tsohle.
You too find this difficult, try this.	Le uena u fumana sena se le thata, leka sena.
Simply learning is not enough.	Ho ithuta feela ha hoa lekana.
The night went on.	Bosiu bo ile ba tsoela pele.
Of course you do not have it.	Ehlile ha u na eona.
He started first.	A qala ka pele.
In fact, he seemed to love her very much.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a bonahala a mo rata haholo.
There was never a single one near that.	Ho ne ho se mohla ho kileng ha ba le le le leng le haufi le seo.
A lot of things happened.	Ho ile ha etsahala lintho tse ngata.
I will help you tomorrow.	Ke tla o thusa hosane.
Time flies very fast.	Nako e tsamaea kapele haholo.
I still felt like a child.	Ke ne ke ntse ke ikutloa joaloka ngoana.
Leave a space.	Tlohela sebaka se itseng.
My hair was almost standing on end.	Moriri oa ka o ne o batla o ema qetellong.
Her main job is to take care of her father.	Mosebetsi oa hae o moholo ke ho hlokomela ntate oa hae.
Obviously not.	Ho hlakile hore ba ne ba sa etsa joalo.
They do this early in the morning for a reason.	Ba etsa joalo esale hoseng ka lebaka le itseng.
They are very happy.	Ba thabile haholo.
I don't even know mine.	Ha ke tsebe le ea ka.
It was not what he was supposed to be.	E ne e se seo a neng a lokela ho ba sona.
Ideas for adult writing.	Maikutlo a ho ngola motho e moholo.
It goes on in a strange way.	E tsoela pele ka mokhoa o makatsang.
And yet, here we are.	Mme leha ho le jwalo, ke rona bana.
Maybe not you.	Mohlomong ha se uena.
It works great.	E sebetsa haholo.
That's right, that's right.	Ke hantle, ho jwalo.
You should eat.	U lokela ho ja.
It will take us both.	E tla re nka bobeli ba rona.
Do not touch him unless he tries to walk away.	U se ke ua mo tšoara ntle leha a leka ho tsamaea.
People have to pay.	Batho ba tlameha ho lefa.
I'm trying to fix this.	Ke ntse ke leka ho lokisa sena.
Anything else? 	Ho na le se seng hape?
You can feel alone.	U ka ikutloa u le mong.
He's here now.	O teng mona hona jwale.
He didn't just tell me.	Ha aa ka a mpolella feela.
I feel down with my hands.	Ke utloa fatše ka matsoho a ka.
I don't need them at all.	Ha ke li hloke ka letho.
I see a few problems with this.	Ke bona mathata a 'maloa ka sena.
So, he went ahead.	Kahoo, o ile a ea pele.
We need to hear what other people think and do.	Re lokela ho utloa seo batho ba bang ba se nahanang le ho se etsa.
There is no way.	Haho tsela feela.
It was time to start working again.	E ne e le nako ea ho qala ho sebetsa hape.
It was real, though it could not be real.	E ne e le ea sebele, le hoja e ne e ke ke ea e-ba ea sebele.
He helped her in.	A mo thusa ho kena.
It is very dangerous.	Ho kotsi haholo.
Sometimes you just have to let go.	Ka linako tse ling u tlameha feela ho e tlohela.
However, that was not enough.	Leha ho le joalo, hoo ho ne ho sa lekana.
The boy knew very well that he had to be in school.	Moshanyana o ne a tseba hantle hore o lokela ho ba sekolong.
Man has only a few years to do well.	Motho o na le lilemo tse ngata feela ho etsa hantle.
I started to feel bad.	Ke ile ka qala ho utloa bohloko.
And in my name, too.	Le ka lebitso la ka, hape.
To me, that has never been a problem.	Ho ’na, hoo ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba bothata.
Nothing should be there.	Ha ho letho le lokelang ho ba teng.
Let's talk first.	Ha re bue pele.
Everyone of the same type, that is.	E mong le e mong oa mofuta o tšoanang, ke hore.
And that's where we are.	Mme ke hona moo re leng teng.
Yes, that's right.	E, ke 'nete.
What he is is still very good.	Seo a leng sona se ntse se le ntle haholo.
It only takes a day.	E nka letsatsi feela.
He studied for three hours.	O ile a ithuta lihora tse tharo.
Or was it something else?	Kapa na e ne e le ntho e ’ngoe hape?
I am no longer a young man.	Ha ke sa le mohlankana.
Because he is a person.	Hobane ke motho.
Some, once every three years.	Ba bang, hang feela ka mor'a lilemo tse tharo.
Sometimes he did not understand.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a sa utloisise.
Not too close.	Haufi haufi.
That's what we think.	Ke seo re se nahanang.
I'll be back tomorrow.	Ke tla khutla hosane.
I really enjoy your site.	Ke thabela sebaka sa hau haholo.
It made no sense at all.	Ho ne ho se na kelello ho hang.
If you use the old version, you can still be fine.	Haeba u sebelisa mofuta oa khale, u ntse u ka ba hantle.
I can't do any good here.	Ha ke khone ho etsa molemo mona.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
By this we live.	Ka sena re phela.
They gave us food.	Ba ile ba re fa lijo.
I love her so much.	Ke mo rata haholo.
This is exactly what he wants to do with it.	Sena ke sona hantle seo a batlang ho se etsa ka eona.
He never knew how you could have both.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a tseba hore na u ka ba le tsona ka bobeli joang.
It will not continue.	E ke ke ea tsoela pele.
That is why they met.	Ke lona lebaka le entseng hore ba kopane.
We have enough.	Re na le tse lekaneng.
He would give them whatever we had.	O ne a ba fa eng kapa eng eo re neng re e-na le eona.
I don't want to use people.	Ha ke batle ho sebelisa batho.
No one knows where he went.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang moo a ileng teng.
We do that.	Re etsa joalo.
What he was in.	Seo a neng a le ho sona.
No, you do not have to do everything yourself.	Che, ha ho hlokahale hore u etse ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe u le mong.
He obviously has a reading problem.	Ho hlakile hore o na le bothata ba ho bala.
I do not know what will happen.	Ha ke tsebe se tla etsahala.
How could you.	U ne u ka khona joang.
I had to sleep.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho robala.
He sees danger.	O bona kotsi.
Where did they come from?	Li ne li tsoa hokae?
This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me.	Ena ke ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa e kileng ea etsahala.
That has to go back to.	Seo se tlameha ho khutlela ho.
So we went in.	Kahoo ra kena.
He did not know for a long time.	O qetile nako e telele a sa tsebe.
It is dangerous to see them like me.	E le kotsi ho bona joalo ka 'na.
We are happy to help.	Re thabela ho thusa.
Or everyone thought.	Kapa e mong le e mong o ne a nahana.
Then he realized something was wrong.	Eaba o hlokomela hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
I think it is very difficult.	Ke nahana hore e thata haholo.
I certainly did.	Ka sebele ke ile ka etsa joalo.
Be emotional.	Eba le maikutlo.
Look carefully.	Sheba ka hloko.
But we do the best we can.	Empa re etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
We found a house and got help.	Re ile ra fumana ntlo ’me ra fumana thuso.
Your hair looks beautiful, by the way.	Moriri oa hau o shebahala o le motle, ka tsela.
I'll get it soon.	Ke tla e fumana haufinyane.
Thanks for telling me it works well in the morning.	Ke leboha ho mpolella hore e sebetsa hantle hoseng.
You once did.	U kile ua etsa joalo.
Is there something wrong, doctor?	Na ho na le phoso, ngaka?
A child is a problem.	Ngoana ke bothata.
It did not matter.	Ho ne ho se na taba.
But I can't.	Empa ha ke khone.
He wanted to live.	O ne a batla ho phela.
He will be at the party tonight.	O tla be a le moketeng bosiung bona.
It is a very simple question.	Ke potso e bonolo haholo.
But they are living their lives.	Empa ba phela bophelo ba bona.
It was really about something.	E ne e hlile e bua ka ntho e itseng.
This has been, as always, the only work time.	Ena e bile, joalo ka kamehla, nako ea mosebetsi feela.
Also, he did not hear anything.	Hape, ha aa ka a utloa letho.
Or maybe he did not.	Kapa mohlomong ha ea ka ea etsa joalo.
You can tell me.	O ka mpolella.
You know you don't need sleep.	Ua tseba hore ha u hloke ho robala.
They really know how to work.	Ehlile ba tseba ho sebetsa.
We have to move fast.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea kapele.
But whatever it is, it is better to fix it quickly.	Empa hore na ke eng, ho molemo ho e lokisa kapele.
Tom knew he expected her to say something.	Tom o ne a tseba hore o lebeletse hore a bue ho hong.
Must be.	Ho joalo.
I loved wearing her.	Ke ne ke rata ho mo apara.
Because I am a dog.	Ke hobane ke ntja.
We know everything.	Re tseba tsohle.
I give you time.	Ke o fa nako.
Re.	Re.
I will call him now.	Ke tla mo letsetsa hona joale.
That way, no one would see you.	Ka tsela eo, ho ne ho se motho ea tla u bona.
Just take it.	Ho e nka feela.
Well, that's true.	Be, ke 'nete.
Thank you	Kea leboha
We start again.	Re qala hape.
There was so much going on.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang.
I told her how she could do it and she did.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore na a ka khona joang 'me a etsa joalo.
It should not be so.	Ha ea lokela ho ba joalo.
There was no time for anything.	Ho ne ho se nako ea letho.
These are the people of the morning.	Bana ke batho ba hoseng.
No one noticed him as he entered.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo hlokomela ha a kena.
I never planned that.	Ha ke eso rera seo.
They didn't know he was here.	Ba ne ba eso tsebe hore o teng mona.
I do nothing of that.	Ha ke etse letho la tseo.
He and others were deeply hurt.	Eena le ba bang ba utloa bohloko haholo.
It should do a lot of good in that area.	E lokela ho etsa molemo o moholo sebakeng seo.
But he can't come back with them.	Empa ha a khone ho khutla ka tsona.
It was the same danger.	E ne e le kotsi e tšoanang.
She was a woman.	E ne e le mosali.
You are often to blame for this.	Hangata o na le molato bakeng sa sena.
That was good news.	Eo e ne e le litaba tse monate.
The young man did not learn to read.	Mohlankana eo ha aa ka a ithuta ho bala.
From last year.	Ho tloha selemong se fetileng.
Thank you.	Kea leboha.
It does.	E ntse e e etsa.
Please save water.	Ka kopo, boloka metsi.
I have some good friends.	Ke na le metsoalle e molemo.
But please do not come back again.	Empa ke kopa o se ke oa khutla hape.
You can ask all the questions you like.	U ka botsa lipotso tsohle tseo u li ratang.
No one was injured.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a tsoa kotsi.
I like dogs.	Ke rata ntja.
He seems to be a real person.	Ho bonahala eka ke motho oa sebele.
Start fixing things now.	Qala ho lokisa lintho hona joale.
All right.	Hantle.
But maybe it's just me.	Empa mohlomong ke nna feela.
Someone has to take care of you.	Ho na le motho ea lokelang ho u hlokomela.
He left.	O ile a tsamaea.
Be careful!	Hlokomela!
You would use the car front and back.	U ne u tla sebelisa koloi pele le ka morao.
And you wouldn't have to sleep with me.	Mme o ne o sa tlo tlameha ho robala le nna.
This was not true.	Sena e ne e se 'nete.
And they need us all now.	'Me ba re hloka kaofela hona joale.
They knew.	Ba ne ba tseba.
That was important.	Seo e ne e le sa bohlokoa.
He really does exist.	O hlile o teng.
That is a.	Ke hore a.
I will make sure they have your name.	Ke tla etsa bonnete ba hore ba na le lebitso la hau.
Tom would have done that tomorrow.	Tom o tla be a entse seo hosane.
She never talked about having a boyfriend or anything like that.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka ho ba le mohlankana kapa ntho leha e le efe e joalo.
Tired of the pain.	Khathetse ke bohloko.
But some people.	Empa batho ba bang.
However, this is not the case for man.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se joalo ho motho.
There was only one reason for that.	Ho ne ho e-na le lebaka le le leng feela la seo.
We wanted to know what happened and why.	Re ne re batla ho tseba hore na ho etsahetse’ng le hore na ke hobane’ng.
This will not happen.	Sena se ke ke sa etsahala.
We also know this.	Sena hape re se tseba.
I can't find that.	Ha ke fumane seo.
People do this every day.	Batho ba etsa sena letsatsi le letsatsi.
What kind of food do you like to eat?	U rata ho ja lijo tsa mofuta ofe?
No child will enjoy that.	Ha ho ngoana ea tla thabela seo.
Do not drink and drive.	U se ke ua noa 'me ua khanna.
The blame was heavy on him.	Molato o ne o le boima ho eena.
But we must try.	Empa re tlameha ho leka.
He could speak.	O ne a khona ho bua.
They certainly had reason to be.	Ka sebele ba ne ba e-na le lebaka la ho ba joalo.
Last night.	Bosiu ba nako e fetileng.
That's his way out.	Ke tsela ea hae ea ho tsoa.
I know.	Kea tseba.
Clearly, something is wrong.	Ho hlakile hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
Some of them probably have no money at all.	Tse ling tsa tsona mohlomong ha li na chelete ea letho.
However, some were glad to hear the news.	Leha ho le joalo, ba bang ba ile ba thabela ho utloa litaba tseo.
They are good at that.	Ba hantle ho seo.
It is very easy when you know how to do it.	Ho bonolo haholo ha o tseba ho etsa joalo.
It was the first time she had seen him there.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele a mo bona moo.
Absolutely not possible.	Ho hang hoo ho ke ke ha etsahala.
And now it was his.	Mme jwale e ne e le wa hae.
Then he went back to work.	Eaba e khutlela mosebetsing hape.
Just leave, you.	Tloha feela, wena.
My mother did not say anything about returning home.	'Mè ha aa ka a bua letho ka hore ba lokela ho khutlela hae.
Delicious dinner.	Lijo tse monate tsa mantsiboea.
By then it is too late.	Ka nako eo e se e le morao haholo.
Yet he falls for it.	Leha ho le joalo o oa eona.
he asked.	a botsa.
I was thinking only of you.	Ke ne ke nahana ka uena feela.
Having one of us there should be enough.	Ho ba le e mong oa rona moo ho lokela ho lekana.
You found us.	U re fumane.
We never heard from them.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra utloa maikutlo a bona.
It seems somewhat difficult.	Ho bonahala ho le thata ka tsela e itseng.
I love you so much.	Ke u rata haholo.
The team loves you.	Sehlopha sea u rata.
I must have wanted to say something.	Ke tlameha ho batla ho bua ho hong.
This is what I do.	Sena ke seo ke se etsang.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
Go ahead with this.	Tsoela pele ka sena.
I'm still very happy about it.	Ke ntse ke thabile haholo ka eona.
His status and whereabouts.	Boemo ba hae le hore na o hokae.
I don't think so.	Ke nahana hore ha ho joalo.
And we said so.	Mme ra bua jwalo.
If they could meet, which they would not do.	Haeba ba ne ba ka kopana, e leng seo ba neng ba ke ke ba se etsa.
No one else has ever spoken like me.	Ha ho motho e mong ea kileng a bua joalo ka 'na.
It's worse than you can imagine.	E mpe haholo ho feta kamoo o ka nahanang.
Obviously it should not be.	Ho hlakile hore ha ea lokela ho ba teng.
That my hair was falling out.	Hore moriri oa ka o ne o oa.
I look forward to reading many more from you.	Ke emetse ho bala tse ling tse ngata ho tsoa ho uena.
I see you feel better.	Kea u bona u ikutloa betere.
Try to eat more often.	Leka ho ja hangata.
Well, this group.	Hantle, sehlopha sena.
Or they will just think.	Kapa ba tla nahana feela.
Then start again.	Joale qala hape.
Do not have children.	Se be le bana.
Get better at it.	Fumana betere ho eona.
If you do not understand them, ask questions.	Haeba u sa li utloisise, botsa lipotso.
They want children.	Ba batla bana.
Good news, he says.	Litaba tse monate, o re.
They cried	Ba ile ba lla
I did not tell him anything.	Ha kea ka ka mo bolella letho.
Are you sure?.	U na le bonnete?.
Everyone was crying.	Bohle ba ne ba lla.
You do not know what you are talking about.	Ha o tsebe seo o buang ka sona.
They've seen what they are.	Ba bone seo ba leng sona.
They will have children.	Ba tla ba le bana.
He says he is very sorry.	O re masoabi haholo.
I have a feeling that this is going to be another one.	Ke na le maikutlo a hore ena e tla ba e 'ngoe.
The children find it and try it.	Bana ba li fumana ebe ba li leka.
He had decided.	O ne a entse qeto.
I hope you did not understand some of them.	Ke tšepa hore ha ua ka ua utloisisa tse ling tsa tsona.
It doesn't matter when you do it.	Ha ho na taba hore na o e etsa neng.
It is not an easy task.	Ha se mosebetsi o bonolo.
I was not sure what it meant.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na e bolela eng.
I hope that means being both.	Ke tšepa hore ho bolela ho ba bobeli.
Maybe they feel worthless.	Mohlomong ba ikutloa ba se na thuso.
But neither does he want to help us.	Empa le rona ha a batle ho re thusa.
I had no problem handling them.	Ha kea ka ka ba le bothata ba ho li tšoara.
We could see it coming.	Re ne re e bona e tla.
I tell you.	Kea u bolella.
They did well.	Ba entse hantle.
He can't think of it.	Ha a khone ho e nahana.
He was too.	Le eena o ne a le joalo.
And he helped.	Mme o ile a thusa.
You do not know what you will get.	Ha o tsebe hore na o tla fumana eng.
I really want to do this.	Ke hlile ke batla ho etsa sena.
Knowing more about the group works everywhere.	Ho tseba haholoanyane ka sehlopha ho sebetsa kae kapa kae.
Why is he doing this?	Ke hobane'ng ha a etsa see?
You just can't do it.	O ka se etse feela.
Thank you so much for making my life better.	Ke leboha haholo ka ho etsa hore bophelo ba ka bo be monate.
Sometimes it seemed as if they had never slept.	Ka linako tse ling ho ne ho bonahala eka ha ho mohla ba kileng ba robala.
He is a real expert.	Ke setsebi sa sebele.
People did not seem to care.	Ho ne ho bonahala batho ba sa tsotelle.
They found nothing.	Ha baa ka ba fumana letho.
At the time of his accident.	Nakong ea kotsi ea hae.
He stays behind.	O dula a le morao.
They didn't have it.	Ba ne ba se na eona.
My mother was so happy that she cried.	’Mè o ne a thabile hoo a ileng a lla.
Just really my thing.	Feela ha e le hantle ntho ea ka.
The faster you fall, the faster you go.	Ha u oa kapele, u tsamaea kapele.
His friends were playing together.	Metsoalle ea hae e ne e bapala hammoho.
Call a doctor.	Letsetsa ngaka.
I loved it there.	Ke ne ke e rata moo.
They can cry for the rest of their lives.	Ba ka lula ba lla bophelo bohle ba bona.
You will always be close.	O tla dula o le haufi.
Then nothing happens for a long time.	Ebe ha ho letho le etsahalang ka nako e telele.
Let your child be a child.	Lumella ngoana oa hau hore e be ngoana.
There was a man there, or he was there.	Ho na le monna moo, kapa o ne a le teng.
We are having a wonderful time.	Re nakong e monate haholo.
I am just a son.	Ke mora feela.
Be careful!	Hlokomela!
But that is not the case.	Empa ha ho joalo.
We were very late in the day.	Re ne re le morao haholo ka letsatsi.
The children began to sing.	Bana ba ile ba qala ho bina.
They would have to see.	Ba ne ba tla tlameha ho bona.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
He wanted them to know that he loved the idea.	O ne a batla hore ba tsebe hore o rata mohopolo oo.
You have to give them that.	O lokela ho ba fa seo.
Don't try with me.	O seke oa leka le nna.
They did not have enough food.	Ba ne ba se na lijo tse lekaneng.
I have a date.	Ke na le letsatsi.
I really have to give it up again.	Ke hlile ke lokela ho fana ka eona hape.
They were there at the time.	Ba ne ba le teng ka nako eo.
Be a man, a child.	Eba monna, ngoana.
The children were skeptical.	Bana ba ne ba belaela.
That did not happen.	Seo ha se ya etsahala.
But notice here.	Empa hlokomela mona.
You're a weird woman.	U mosali ea makatsang.
Their children were not theirs.	Bana ba bona e ne e se ba bona.
However, there are problems with this method.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le mathata ka mokhoa ona.
After that, everything went well.	Ka mor'a moo, tsohle li ile tsa tsamaea hantle.
I can't trust them.	Ha ke khone ho ba tšepa.
The doctor arrived just in time.	Ngaka e ile ea fihla ka nako eona eo.
Maybe keep working here.	Mohlomong u lule u sebetsa mona.
What do you want from us?	O batla eng ho rona?
Everyone is there for a reason.	E mong le e mong o teng ka lebaka.
I wanted to try it for that very reason.	Ke ne ke batla ho e leka ka lona lebaka leo.
And then it was gone.	Mme ebe e ile.
He was not a man.	E ne e se le monna.
It was a very strange thing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang haholo.
So he had already been arrested.	Kahoo o ne a se a ntse a tšoeroe.
Stand or sit down while working.	Ema kapa u lule fatše ha u ntse u sebetsa.
We ate very tasty food.	Re ile ra ja lijo tse monate haholo.
I did not expect to do it.	Ke ne ke sa lebella ho e etsa.
He was thinking of getting out.	O ne a nahana ho tsoa.
Empty children feel worthless.	Bana ba se nang letho ba ikutloa hore hase letho.
There is a problem, of course.	Ho na le bothata, ehlile.
You write things down and ask what they mean.	U ntse u ngola lintho fatše ebe u botsa hore na li bolela eng.
Love this so much.	Rata sena haholo.
He loved her for that reason.	O ne a mo rata ka lebaka leo.
It will fall.	E tla oa.
It had never been so powerful before.	E ne e eso be matla hakana pele.
My food was very good.	Lijo tsa ka li ne li le ntle haholo.
It did not stop.	Ha ea ka ea ema.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
It's been a while since I've been on it.	E se e le nako esale ke tsoela pele.
I would look into that.	Ke ne ke tla sheba taba eo.
So he refused to go.	Kahoo a hana ho ea.
My way of life.	Tsela ya ka ya ho phela.
And you probably will.	'Me mohlomong u tla etsa joalo.
Spending more money than you do is a bad thing.	Ho sebelisa chelete e ngata ho feta eo u e etsang ke ntho e mpe.
He could have been powerful, even if he was skeptical.	O ne a ka ba le matla, leha a ne a belaela.
So we left last week.	Kahoo re ile ra tsamaea bekeng e fetileng.
I didn't care to live.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle ho phela.
Then he opened them and spoke more like before.	Eaba oa li bula ’me o bua haholoanyane joaloka pele.
They will usually call.	Hangata ba tla letsa.
That this was his last chance.	Hore ona e ne e le monyetla oa hae oa ho qetela.
His clothes were so heavy that he could not walk.	Liaparo tsa hae li ne li le boima hoo a neng a sitoa ho tsamaea.
That is for all to decide.	Ke hore bohle ba etse qeto.
Nothing important right now.	Ha ho letho le bohlokoa hona joale.
Very good question.	Potso e ntle haholo.
I know how they do that.	Ke tseba kamoo ba etsang seo.
It was not a question.	E ne e se potso.
I did not sleep last night.	Ha kea ka ka robala bosiung bo fetileng.
More than a few things has not been so easy.	Ho feta tse seng kae ha hoa ka ha e-ba bonolo hakaalo.
I doubted he would refuse.	Ke ne ke belaela hore o tla hana.
He may not think so, but it is.	E ka 'na eaba ha a nahane joalo, empa ho joalo.
I see, really.	Ke bona, ruri.
He did not like to think of other children.	O ne a sa rate ho nahana ka bana ba bang.
You can make friends.	U ka etsa metsoalle.
We drink water.	Re noa metsi.
What they did, without me being present.	Seo ba se entseng, ntle le hore ke be teng.
Also, there is no guarantee that anyone knows this.	Hape, ha ho na bonnete ba hore motho o tseba sena.
We go back.	Re khutlela morao.
She is used to it.	O e tloaetse.
It would be nice to hear from you.	Ho ka ba monate ho utloa ho tsoa ho uena.
We can both enjoy this now.	Ka bobeli re ka thabela sena hona joale.
We only eat breakfast.	Re ja lijo tsa hoseng feela.
It was empty.	E ne e se na letho.
It will work from time to time.	E tla sebetsa nako le nako.
He was injured in an accident.	O ile a tsoa kotsi kotsing.
No, more help was needed.	Che, ho ne ho tla hlokahala thuso e ’ngoe.
He did not know how long before that.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ke nako e kae pele ho moo.
Clearly it was a group.	Ho hlakile hore e ne e le sehlopha.
But what happens, you want to talk.	Empa ho etsahalang, o batla ho bua.
You too wait a minute.	Le uena ema hanyane.
I loved her so much.	Ke ne ke mo rata haholo.
It was almost enough.	E ne e batla e lekana.
He is not the only one.	Ha se eena feela eo.
Please keep playing it with us !.	Ke kopa o lule u ntse u e bapala le rona!.
I visit them both.	Ke ba etela ka bobeli.
Let me think.	E re ke nahane.
I knew his wife well, and now they have met.	Ke ne ke tseba mosali oa hae hantle, 'me joale ba kopane.
Thanks for it.	Kea leboha ka eona.
It's that simple.	E bonolo joalo.
They will start in the morning.	Ba tla qala hoseng.
His life is very difficult.	Bophelo ba hae bo boima haholo.
Of course, they did not know.	Ha e le hantle, ba ne ba sa tsebe.
This is our job.	Ona ke mosebetsi oa rona.
No one else came in with him.	Ha ho motho e mong ea ileng a kena le eena.
I'm sure they must be.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore ba tlameha ho ba joalo.
That's the way we have a phone.	Ke tsela eo re nang le mohala ka eona.
Now we have.	Joale re na le.
They were very much needed.	Ba ne ba hlokahala haholo.
I love my family and friends more than anything.	Ke rata lelapa la ka le metsoalle ho feta eng kapa eng.
You go out there to do all you can.	U tsoa moo ho etsa sohle seo u ka se khonang.
Here is the problem with that.	Mona ke bothata ka seo.
I took care of it.	Ke ile ka o hlokomela.
They liked to dress.	Ba ne ba rata ho apara.
And the best people.	Le batho ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He loved his style.	O ne a rata mokhoa oa hae.
The day will pass, it must pass.	Letsatsi le tla feta, le tlameha ho feta.
I think it’s a learning process.	Ke nahana hore ke mokhoa oa ho ithuta.
Good job, son.	Mosebetsi o motle, mora.
He was already late for work.	O ne a se a le morao mosebetsing.
I make it live.	Ke e etsa ho phela.
They can live without my life.	Ba ka lula ntle le bophelo ba ka.
We do not know who our father was.	Ha re tsebe hore na ntate oa rona e ne e le mang.
Here is their story.	Litaba tsa bona ke tsena.
Dangerous is the same thing.	E kotsi ke ntho e le 'ngoe.
I thought about my past.	Ke ile ka nahana ka bophelo ba ka bo fetileng.
He enjoys being with his friends.	O thabela ho ba le metsoalle ea hae.
I had no time for that.	Ke ne ke sena nako ya seo.
But this is something new.	Empa sena ke ntho e ncha.
You just treated it that way.	U sa tsoa e tšoara joalo.
I want you and me.	Ke batla wena le nna.
It had its day.	E bile le letsatsi la eona.
He did just that.	O ile a etsa joalo.
Well, for many of them.	Hantle, ho ba bangata ba bona.
It should not be until tomorrow.	Ha e ea lokela ho fihlela hosane.
However, no one wants to talk about getting it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho ea batlang ho bua ka ho fumana.
This is true.	Sena ke 'nete.
I wanted to do nothing to get them.	Ke ne ke batla ke etsa letho ho li fumana.
You were not the same person after you spoke to him.	U ne u se motho ea tšoanang ka mor'a hore u bue le eena.
At work he always studied hard.	Mosebetsing o ne a lula a ithuta ka thata.
He wondered if they had given up.	O ne a ipotsa hore na ebe ba ile ba fana.
I'll tell you something.	Ke tla o bolella se seng.
But he does not speak.	Empa ha a bue.
I was having trouble sleeping.	Ke ne ke na le bothata ba ho robala.
I couldn’t find it at the time.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e fumana ka nako eo.
And now you live with them.	'Me joale u lula le bona.
Some are more important than others.	Tse ling li bohlokoa ho feta tse ling.
We were able to do that.	Re ile ra khona ho etsa joalo.
It is easy to forget.	Ho bonolo ho lebala.
I wouldn't have to finish it now.	Ke ne ke sa tlo tlameha ho e qeta jwale.
Looking at him.	Ho mo sheba.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
But I find nothing about it.	Empa ha ke fumane letho ka eona.
You have to work harder.	U lokela ho sebetsa ka thata haholoanyane.
This is not close to the truth.	Sena ha se haufi le 'nete.
We can go further than that.	Re ka khutlela morao ho feta moo.
But this too will pass.	Empa sena le sona se tla feta.
That is why no one wants to buy our house.	Ke kahoo ho seng motho ea batlang ho reka ntlo ea rona.
I went out and bought them.	Ke ile ka tsoa ka li reka.
It was very difficult for me.	E ne e le boima haholo ho nna.
And do it right.	Mme e etse hantle.
You.	Wena.
Here and there.	Mona le mona.
But he did.	Empa o ile a etsa joalo.
Many thought that he should not do that.	Ba bangata ba ne ba nahana hore ha aa lokela ho etsa joalo.
There can be no.	Ho ka se be teng.
My parents work very hard.	Batsoali ba ka ba sebetsa ka thata haholo.
It could have been anything.	E ka be e bile ntho efe kapa efe.
When we met, she was mild and timid.	Ha re kopana, o ne a le bonolo a bile a le lihlong.
He looked at the children.	O ile a sheba ho bana.
This should be the first step.	Ena e lokela ho ba tsela ea pele.
The two seemed equal.	Bobeli bona bo ne bo bonahala bo lekana.
There is no such thing as spending time with friends.	Ha ho letho le kang ho qeta nako le metsoalle.
It was as if he were there.	E ne eka o ne a le teng.
However, the house was missing.	Leha ho le joalo, ntlo e ne e le sieo.
It works well in almost everything.	E sebetsa hantle hoo e batlang e le ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
Maybe it was time to buy new ones.	Mohlomong e ne e le nako ea ho reka tse ncha.
I can't figure out what they want at this point.	Ha ke khone ho tseba hore na ba batla eng nakong ena.
He finds people.	O fumana batho.
But we can fix this.	Empa re ka lokisa sena.
We started doing things in this area.	Re ile ra qala ho etsa lintho sebakeng sena.
There was nothing new.	Ho ne ho se na ntho e ncha.
He didn't have to do it.	O ne a sa tlameha ho e etsa.
John's mother was very happy.	’Mè oa John o ne a thabile haholo.
I decided.	Ke entse qeto.
It is best for everyone in your group to drink it.	Ho molemo ha e mong le e mong sehlopheng sa hao a e noa.
He will come in tonight.	O tla kena bosiung bona.
I wondered what he was thinking.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na o ne a nahana eng.
The latter.	Ea bobeli.
But the phone did not ring.	Empa mohala ha oa ka oa kena.
Maybe look there.	Mohlomong sheba moo.
Just being there, without first impressions.	Ho ba moo feela, ntle le maikutlo a pele.
No one should take anything.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho nka letho.
I'm not doing this right.	Ha ke etse sena hantle.
We said we would do that.	Re itse re tla etsa joalo.
He will be glad to see you.	O tla thabela ho o bona.
You can look at that.	O ka sheba seo.
I know he did.	Kea tseba o ile a etsa joalo.
So, it is a good thing for everyone.	Ka hona, ke ntho e ntle bakeng sa motho e mong le e mong.
This house is empty.	Ntlo ena ha e na motho.
Don't you think we can ask for help?	Na ha u nahane hore re ka kopa thuso?
He would have to think about it.	O ne a tla lokela ho nahana ka eona.
I do not understand what is difficult to understand about it.	Ha ke utloisise seo ho leng thata ho se utloisisa ka eona.
All of this is very important to me.	Sena sohle se bohlokoa haholo ho nna.
He is alive.	O a phela.
Sometimes he was not sure if he could live in it.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na a ka phela ho eona.
So far everything was working fine.	Ho fihlela joale tsohle li ne li sebetsa hantle.
Things would work out better.	Lintho li ne li tla sebetsa hantle haholoanyane.
It will be this.	E tla ba ena.
That's just my opinion.	Ke eona feela maikutlo a ka.
They should love their children.	Ba lokela ho rata bana ba bona.
It takes years to learn to speak.	Ho nka lilemo tse ngata ho ithuta ho bua.
I can tell when someone is behind my husband.	Ke khona ho tseba ha motho a le morao ho monna oa ka.
He looked at it reluctantly.	O ile a e sheba ka ho se rate.
You will, boy.	U tla etsa joalo, moshanyana.
There was no question of trying.	Ho ne ho se potso ea ho leka.
So you will live.	Kahoo u tla phela.
I hope this will also be true for you.	Ke tšepa hore sena e tla ba 'nete le ho uena.
By one of his children.	Ka e mong oa bana ba hae.
That was a strange thing.	Seo e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
He finally agreed.	Qetellong o ile a lumela.
Others have seen it too.	Ba bang le bona ba e bone.
It goes faster than anything.	E tsamaea kapele ho feta eng kapa eng.
Or maybe he just couldn't.	Kapa mohlomong o ne a sa khone.
It will not be from now on.	Ha ho na ho tloha joale.
It can be one or the other.	E ka ba e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe feela.
That's what he was trying to do.	Ke seo a neng a leka ho se etsa.
It was a wonderful day.	E ne e le letsatsi le monate haholo.
Now believe it.	Joale e lumele.
Here, take him.	Mona, mo nke.
And it's a family.	Mme ke lelapa.
We will keep it simple.	Re tla e boloka e le bonolo.
He sat very down.	O ile a lula fatše haholo.
You will have to call him.	O tla lokela ho mo letsetsa.
We'll talk more tomorrow.	Re tla bua haholo hosane.
The phone rings.	Mohala oa lla.
I will have to go to work.	Ke tla tlameha ho ea mosebetsing.
He knew, he knew and everyone knew it was a group.	O ne a tseba, a tseba mme bohle ba tseba hore ke sehlopha.
He needed her to need him.	O ne a mo hloka hore a mo hloke.
And they knew why.	Mme ba ne ba tseba lebaka.
It needed to be both of them.	Ho ne ho hlokahala hore e be bobeli ba bona.
You can do it again just for fun.	U ka e etsa hape bakeng sa monate feela.
That certainly is not the case.	Hore ka sebele ha ho joalo.
We never heard of them.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra utloa ka bona.
Even more so now than ever before.	Le ho feta hona joale ho feta pele.
The law was very strict.	Molao o ne o le thata haholo.
That seems to me a very important decision.	Seo se bonahala ho 'na e le qeto ea bohlokoa haholo.
Think before you speak.	Nahana pele u bua.
People who say bad things have not walked in our shoes.	Batho ba buang lintho tse mpe ha baa tsamaea ka lieta tsa rona.
But they have not.	Empa ha ba eso.
If it works well, they will make money.	Haeba e sebetsa hantle, ba tla etsa chelete.
I am working to find a doctor.	Ke sebetsa ho batla ngaka.
I can't even imagine.	Ha ke khone le ho nahana.
But the night is very clear.	Empa bosiu bo hlakile haholo.
I wonder where you will go.	Kea ipotsa hore na u tla kena hokae.
I was so excited to do it so much.	Ke ne ke thabetse ho e etsa haholo.
No, it's not that good.	Che, ha e ntle hakaalo.
I just asked you what you want.	Ke sa tsoa u botsa hore na u batla eng.
Then he begins to read.	Joale o qala ho bala.
This is very important.	Sena se bohlokoa haholo.
I decided to try it one last time.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho e leka lekhetlo la ho qetela.
We did not dress and dress this way.	Ha rea ​​ka ra apara le ho apara ka tsela ena.
He works hard every day.	O sebetsa ka thata letsatsi le letsatsi.
The accident paid off.	Kotsi e ile ea lefa.
They refused to let them go.	Ba hana ho ba tlohela.
Which is what we will have to do, in the end.	E leng seo re tla tlameha ho se etsa, qetellong.
That is where our problems began.	Ke moo mathata a rona a ileng a qala.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
It's as simple as that.	E bonolo joalo ka eona.
I could not enjoy that day.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho thabela letsatsi leo.
Find some amazing stuff there.	Fumana lintho tse ling tse makatsang moo.
Everyone knew where we were going and when.	E mong le e mong o ne a tseba hore na re tla tla hokae hona neng.
They used to do everything together.	Ba ne ba tloaetse ho etsa lintho tsohle hammoho.
And they will be glad to see you.	Mme ba tla thabela ho o bona.
Why, it doesn't matter.	Hobaneng, ha ho bohlokoa.
He does not need to talk to you every day.	Ha ho hlokahale hore a bue le wena letsatsi le letsatsi.
He made a mistake.	O entse phoso.
I looked at him.	Ke ile ka mo sheba.
Tom is just as busy as last year.	Tom o ntse a phathahane joaloka selemong se fetileng.
Obviously he still has something he wants to say.	Ho hlakile hore o ntse a e-na le ho hong hoo a batlang ho ho bua.
It happens in the end.	E etsahala qetellong.
I really like the idea.	Ke hlile ke rata mohopolo.
It was right here, now.	E ne e le hona mona, hona joale.
Here is the thought.	Mohopolo ke ona.
It will come to me.	E tla tla ho 'na.
is.	ke.
They are there too.	Le tsona li teng.
Family for us.	Lelapa bakeng sa rona.
I sat down next to him and sat down.	Ke ile ka lula fatše haufi le eena eaba ke lula.
He didn't look like that.	O ne a sa bonahale a le jwalo.
He did not stop.	Ha a ka a ema.
She decided to ask him one more time.	A etsa qeto ea ho mo botsa lekhetlo le leng hape.
To think of him, in the way a person does.	Ho nahana ka eena, ka tsela eo motho a etsang ka eona.
Like me, he wants it.	Joaloka 'na, oa e batla.
I'd like to ask it here again.	Ke kopa ho e botsa mona hape.
It should have been strange to you.	E ne e lokela ho ba ntho e makatsang ho uena.
That's the news.	Litaba ke tseo.
His problem was loneliness.	Bothata ba hae e ne e le bolutu.
As long as you want or.	Ha feela o batla kapa.
And it really is probably a problem.	Mme ha e le hantle mohlomong ke bothata.
He seems to be asking.	Ho bonahala eka oa botsa.
He was good at what he did, he knew.	O ne a le motle ho seo a se entseng, o ne a tseba.
The children were crying for joy.	Bana ba ne ba lla ba thabile.
It was a terrible accident.	E bile kotsi e mpe haholo.
It was late at night, very early in the morning, and there was not much time.	E ne e se e le bosiu, hoseng haholo, mme ho ne ho se nako e ngata.
We believe, instead, it should be a way of life.	Re lumela, ho e-na le hoo, e lokela ho ba tsela ea bophelo.
We go to school in the morning.	Re ea sekolong hoseng.
He would love this house.	O ne a tla rata ntlo ena.
One young man was doing the same thing to the woman.	Mohlankana e mong o ne a etsa se tšoanang ho mosali eo.
I wonder why.	Kea ipotsa hore na hobaneng.
With money, you see where your money is going.	Ka chelete, u bona hore na chelete ea hau e ea kae.
You are thirty.	U na le mashome a mararo.
People can really do whatever they want.	Batho ba ka etsa ka ’nete eo eng kapa eng eo ba e batlang.
But it is necessary.	Empa hoa hlokahala.
These were there.	Tsena li ne li le teng.
But that is what it needs.	Empa ke seo e se hlokang.
She could not have been more beautiful.	O ne a ka se be motle ho feta moo.
This house is old.	Ntlo ena ke ea khale.
You need to tell us something.	U hloka ho re bolella ho hong.
But she was happy.	Empa o ne a thabile.
Let's not assume that.	Ha re nke hore.
I will not be there.	Nka se be teng.
Then he wanted to cry a lot and could not do that.	Joale o ne a batla ho lla haholo 'me a sitoa ho etsa joalo.
There was nothing else, 'he said,' but a place.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng,' a re, 'empa sebaka.
Human dog.	Ntja ya motho.
I thought I was the only one.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke 'na feela.
And if not, they are not.	'Me haeba ho se joalo, ha ba joalo.
So let's make it simple.	Kahoo a re e etse e bonolo.
I will not be present.	Nke ke ka ba teng.
You once asked a teacher a question.	U kile ua botsa tichere potso.
You can tell by.	O ka bolela ka ho.
It is a chance that you can try this.	Ke monyetla oa hore u ka leka sena.
They are still with me.	Ba ntse ba na le nna.
They know who my husband is.	Ba tseba hore na monna oa ka ke mang.
That was very powerful.	Seo se ne se le matla haholo.
We do not have to ask why.	Ha rea ​​tlameha ho botsa hore na hobaneng.
It was hard to imagine a day without it.	Ho ne ho le thata ho nahana ka letsatsi le se nang eona.
Me too, of course.	Le 'na, ka 'nete.
That should be more than enough.	Seo se lokela ho feta ho lekana.
As you wear them.	Ha u ntse u li apara.
He needs your good sense.	O hloka kelello ea hau e ntle.
I did not sleep.	ha kea robala.
You want to ask them.	U batla ho ba botsa.
Image.	Setšoantšo.
I wish you had had it.	Ke lakatsa eka u ka be u bile le eona.
We're done.	Re se re qetile.
She is so beautiful.	O motle jwalo.
And it doesn't matter.	Mme ha ho na taba.
Probably not, either.	Mohlomong e ke ke, le hona.
They could not find their way home.	Ba ne ba sitoa ho fumana tsela ea ho khutlela hae.
But we see that the time may come.	Empa rea ​​bona hore e ka ’na eaba nako ea tla.
That's great.	Ke hantle haholo.
It went well again.	E ile ea tsoela pele hantle hape.
He looked good.	O ne a shebahala hantle.
Thank you.	Ke a leboha.
The morning did not go as planned.	Hoseng ho ne ho sa tsamaea kamoo a neng a lebeletse kateng.
I'm so glad to be here.	Ke thabile haholo ho ba mona.
Never let them go from you.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua li lumella ho tloha ho uena.
You will need them.	U tla li hloka.
I thought we were family.	Ke ne ke nahana hore re lelapa.
Easy, man.	E bonolo, monna.
I have to go.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea.
It just started.	E sa tsoa qala.
I really couldn’t figure out how to do this.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa khone ho fumana mokhoa oa ho etsa sena.
He looked tired, but recently injured.	O ne a shebahala a khathetse, empa a sa tsoa kotsi.
You are a man, and there is nothing wrong with that.	O monna, mme ha ho phoso.
However, he must return home.	Leha ho le joalo, o tlameha ho khutlela hae.
I think that's almost true.	Ke nahana hore e batla e le 'nete.
Then we will have more.	Joale re tla ba le tse ngata.
However, we know how to fix it.	Leha ho le joalo, re tseba ho e lokisa.
He was talking, he was telling me.	O ne a bolela, o ne a mpolella.
I'm sorry about that.	Ke masoabi ka taba eo.
But that did not happen that way.	Empa ha hoa ka ha etsahala ka tsela eo.
The place is surprisingly empty.	Sebaka seo ha se na letho ka mokhoa o makatsang.
It makes you better.	E o etsa betere.
You talk to the family.	U bua le lelapa.
There is nothing like it.	Ha ho letho le kang lona.
You will only have to take a picture of it yourself.	U tla tlameha feela ho e nka setšoantšo u le mong.
Use only when necessary.	Sebelisa feela ha ho hlokahala.
They were both over.	Ka bobeli ba ne ba le ho feta.
Some were better than others while others were good.	Tse ling li ne li le betere ho feta tse ling ha tse ling li le ntle.
In fact, he went ahead of her.	Ha e le hantle, o ile a tsoela pele ka pele ho eena.
That made it easier.	Seo se ile sa etsa hore ho be bonolo.
But still.	Empa leha ho le joalo.
It was him.	E ne e le eena.
It was a very difficult night to say the least.	E ne e le bosiu bo boima haholo ho bua hanyane.
Well, they can't do it.	Be, ba ke ke ba e etsa.
But he was useless.	Empa o ne a se na thuso.
The truth hurts.	'Nete e bohloko.
You have to think about that.	U lokela ho nahana ka seo.
The past years have been difficult for her.	Lilemo tse fetileng li bile thata ho eena.
It is coming.	E ntse e tla.
I think that is a good picture.	Ke nahana hore seo ke setšoantšo se setle.
I'm trying to find a house.	Ke leka ho fumana ntlo.
Keep swimming.	Tsoela pele ho sesa.
And yet.	Mme leha ho le jwalo.
They want to make a law.	Ba batla ho etsa molao.
I had to be with you.	Ke ne ke lokela ho ba le wena.
Or start to.	Kapa qala ho.
It was definitely a great place.	Ka sebele e ne e le sebaka se setle.
But it was nothing new.	Empa e ne e se ntho e ncha.
She cried and cried.	A lla a lla.
Think now that this is not the case.	Nahana hona joale hore ha ho joalo.
Life is very important.	Bophelo ke ba bohlokoa haholo.
From us to you.	Ho tloha ho rona ho ea ho uena.
As in your opinion.	Joalo ka maikutlo a hau.
It is the same time for this.	Ke nako e tšoanang bakeng sa sena.
Buy food.	Reka lijo.
Now, here I am.	Jwale, ke mona.
They didn't, of course.	Ha ba ka ba etsa jwalo, ehlile.
Today is the first day, so far it has been very fun.	Kajeno ke letsatsi la pele, ho fihlela joale le monate haholo.
Now why.	Joale hobaneng.
It was not an easy decision.	E ne e se qeto e bonolo.
Do not even think about refusing.	U se ke ua nahana le ka ho hana.
He thought he had a chance.	O ne a nahana hore o na le monyetla.
So, everyone can do as they please.	Ka hona, e mong le e mong a ka etsa kamoo a ratang kateng.
Time as I work.	Nako joalo ka sebetsa.
He finally agreed.	Qetellong o ile a lumela.
Obviously, we did not know anyone.	Ho hlakile hore ha ho motho eo re neng re mo tseba.
One was today.	E 'ngoe e ne e le kajeno.
It should be a family affair.	E lokela ho ba taba ea lelapa.
He thought nothing of it and went back to sleep.	Ha aa ka a nahana letho ka hona eaba o khutlela ho robala.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
He feels that his time is near.	O ikutloa hore nako ea hae e haufi.
But we enjoy being with our friends.	Empa re thabela hore ebe le metsoalle ea rona.
I want it too bad to be good.	Ke batla e mpe haholo hore e be molemo.
And so that stayed with me.	'Me kahoo seo sa lula le 'na.
He should not drink too much.	Ha aa lokela ho noa haholo.
Maybe yours does too.	Mohlomong le ea hau e etsa joalo.
That kind of work is not easy.	Mosebetsi oa mofuta oo ha o bonolo.
That's how he would live his life, he decided.	Ke kamoo a neng a tla phela bophelo ba hae kateng, a etsa qeto.
She started to cry again.	A qala ho lla hape.
And take a new path back home.	Le ho nka tsela e ncha ea ho khutlela hae.
Work, work.	Mosebetsi, mosebetsi.
I decided to do some of my own time.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho etsa lintho tse ling ka nako ea ka.
I am always with her children.	Ke dula ke ena le bana ba hae.
I love them both.	Ke ba rata ka bobeli.
But almost, it was their team, it was.	Empa ho batla ho le joalo, e ne e le sehlopha sa bona sa sehlopha, ho joalo.
But to make a lot of money.	Empa ho etsa chelete e ngata.
It works too.	E sebetsa hape.
He could do nothing about it.	O ne a ke ke a etsa letho ka hona.
The children were at home even after school.	Bana ba ne ba le hae le ha sekolo se tsoa.
He has a start date and a deadline.	O na le letsatsi la ho qala le letsatsi la ho qetela.
And no shoes.	'Me ha ho lieta.
I thought there would be.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho tla ba teng.
It was me.	O ne o le nna.
You have not eaten.	Ha o eso je.
And he certainly was helpful.	Mme ehlile o ne a na le thuso.
Some children.	Bana ba bang .
I felt better.	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke le betere.
Of course, many.	Ha e le hantle, ba bangata.
Your approach is close to what you need to do.	Mokhoa oa hau o haufi le seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
What are its benefits'.	Molemo oa eona ke ofe'.
Maybe this was not something he should have asked about, he thought.	Mohlomong ena e ne e se ntho eo a neng a lokela ho botsa ka eona, o ile a nahana.
Maybe, maybe, this could work.	Mohlomong, mohlomong, sena se ka sebetsa.
I don’t even know if there is anything we can do for them.	Ha ke tsebe le hore na ho na le seo re ka se etsang ho bona.
But really, I love it.	Empa ha e le hantle, kea e rata.
All of him.	Kaofela ha hae.
I really wonder this.	Ruri ke ipotsa sena.
As it happens, it comes from someone else.	Ha e ntse e etsahala, e tsoa ho motho e mong.
It was a good thing.	E ne e le ntho e ntle.
It was the same for me now.	Ho ne ho le joalo ho 'na joale.
It was a lifelong career, too.	E ne e le mosebetsi oa bophelo bohle, hape.
I eat that every morning.	Ke ja seo hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
It's long gone.	Ke khale e ile.
I told you they went.	Ke o boleletse hore ba ile.
I had to do something.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho etsa ho hong.
I will fix them.	Ke tla li lokisa.
I just got them by mistake.	Ke li fumane feela ka phoso.
Be yourself this thing.	Eba uena ntho ena.
Then I went to school.	Eaba ke ea sekolong.
We know what we did.	Re tseba seo re se entseng.
I found a way.	Ke fumane tsela.
He has to decide what is most important to him.	O lokela ho etsa qeto ea hore na ke eng eo e leng ea bohlokoa ho eena.
He tried another one.	O ile a leka e 'ngoe.
And she knows it very well.	Mme o e tseba hantle haholo.
Life is waiting for you.	Bophelo bo o emetse.
I'm here too.	Le 'na ke teng.
He knew what he was asking of her.	O ne a tseba seo a neng a se kopa ho eena.
She does well.	O etsa hantle.
They started about the same time.	Ba ile ba qala hoo e ka bang ka nako e le 'ngoe.
It seems up to.	E bonahala ho fihlela.
He was too.	Le eena o ne a le joalo.
Please stay with me.	Ke kopa o lule le 'na.
He seemed close to speaking.	O ne a bonahala a le haufi le ho bua.
Because he is strong.	Hobane o matla.
It was time to start.	E ne e le nako ea ho qala.
He knew this place.	O ne a tseba sebaka sena.
This is exactly what is happening now.	Sena ke sona hantle se etsahalang hona joale.
We will have to eat that time.	Re tla lokela ho ja nako eo.
That is one reason why we have made this decision.	Ke lona lebaka le leng leo ka lona re entseng qeto ena.
My children have been their friends for many years.	Bana ba ka e bile metsoalle ea bona ka lilemo tse ngata.
We'll look at it again.	Re tla e sheba hape.
You must not forget.	Ha ua lokela ho lebala.
I'm happy too.	Ke thabile le nna.
Because I needed it.	Hobane ke ne ke e hloka.
Where were the children?	Bana ba ne ba le hokae?
They, in turn, had found nothing.	Le bona ba ne ba sa fumana letho.
I have never thought about that.	Ha ke so nahane ka seo.
She was really pretty.	O ne a hlile a le motle haholo.
But he really did not see anything.	Empa o ne a hlile a sa bone letho.
He paid well and stood with them.	A lefa hantle mme a ema le bona.
I'm glad you have the money.	Ke thabela hore ebe u na le chelete.
He was sure.	O ne a bile le bonnete.
He eventually found a job that he loved.	Qetellong o ile a fumana mosebetsi oo a o ratang.
I couldn’t think without it.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho nahana ntle le eona.
I said nothing in a certain way.	Ha kea ka ka bua letho ka tsela e itseng.
I know that can happen.	Kea tseba hore hoo ho ka etsahala.
He was working.	O ne a sebetsa.
It's very simple.	Ho bonolo haholo.
There may have been others.	E ka 'na eaba ho ne ho e-na le ba bang.
It feels so hard.	E ikutloa e le thata haholo.
Expect to stay longer.	Lebella ho lula nako e telele.
I just hear.	Ke utloa feela.
I love you !.	Kea le rata!.
Not good for that.	Ha e ntle bakeng sa seo.
Probably too much.	Mohlomong e ngata haholo.
Food comes very quickly.	Lijo li tla kapele haholo.
You probably went through it.	Mohlomong u ile ua feta ho eona.
I need to look good.	Ke hloka ho shebahala hantle.
If there is anything to know.	Haeba ho na le ho hong ho tseba.
We are tired.	Re khathetse.
I understand.	Kea utloisisa.
However, here too.	Leha ho le joalo, le mona.
He still loved her.	O ne a ntse a mo rata.
I ask a lot.	Ke botsa haholo.
Others do the same.	Ba bang ba etsa se tšoanang.
I will be the first to believe that.	Ke tla ba oa pele oa ho lumela seo.
Make sure they are also there to watch it.	Etsa bonnete ba hore le bona ba teng ho e shebella.
Clearly, we must fix this issue.	Ho hlakile hore re tlameha ho lokisa taba ena.
I should not say anything.	Ha kea lokela ho bua letho.
There was a bad mistake, he knew that without knowing why.	Ho ne ho e-na le phoso e mpe, o ne a tseba seo ntle le ho tseba lebaka.
He may not get another chance.	A ka nna a se fumane monyetla o mong.
And he didn't take a chance.	'Me o ne a sa nka monyetla.
But that passed, quickly.	Empa seo se ile sa feta, kapele.
So, if you want to go you have to do it first.	Kahoo, haeba u batla ho tsamaea u tlameha ho etsa joalo pele.
I see you have it.	Kea bona hore u na le eona.
And maybe heavy.	'Me mohlomong boima.
It was very difficult for him.	E ne e le boima haholo ho eena.
Was that so? 	Na ho ne ho le joalo?
There are three things we can do with our money.	Ho na le lintho tse tharo tseo re ka li etsang ka chelete ea rona.
Try to be better.	Leka ho ba betere.
We're done.	Re qetile.
People knew him.	Batho ba ne ba mo tseba.
Here it was a real thing.	Mona e ne e le ntho ea sebele.
There were no problems.	Ho ne ho se na mathata.
Our life here.	Bophelo ba rona mona.
Maybe they didn't hear.	Mohlomong ba ne ba sa utloa.
Where you have everything, but, nothing.	Moo u nang le tsohle, empa, ha ho letho.
There is a time and place for it.	Ho na le nako le sebaka sa eona.
I really have to think.	Ke hlile ke tlameha ho nahana.
They know when we are suffering or when we are suffering in any way.	Baa tseba ha re utloa bohloko kapa re utloa bohloko ka tsela leha e le efe.
If you need anything else, we will tell you.	Haeba u hloka ntho e 'ngoe hape, re tla u bolella.
They have to fix it.	Ba tlameha ho e lokisa.
That's not the way it should be.	Ha se tsela eo e lokelang ho ba ka eona.
It was a bad thing to do.	E ne e le ntho e mpe ho e etsa.
As in the past.	Joalo ka nako eo khale.
Obviously this is not the whole picture.	Ho hlakile hore sena ha se setšoantšo sohle.
My head was the size of his legs.	Hlooho ea ka e ne e lekana le maoto a hae.
I don't see that.	Ha ke bone seo.
Not often.	Hangata ha ho joalo.
The problem was easier than it seemed.	Bothata bo ne bo le bonolo ho feta kamoo bo neng bo shebahala kateng.
Where are they going?	Ba ea hokae?
But there is more.	Empa ho na le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I believe in hard work and love for what we do.	Ke lumela ho sebetsa ka thata le ho rata seo re se etsang.
Yes, and yet it is not.	Ho joalo, leha ho le joalo ha ho joalo.
Save your time and money.	Boloka nako le chelete ea hau.
It was the same with everyone else.	Ho bile joalo le ka bohle.
This is not my case.	Sena ha se taba ea ka.
We'll tell you how.	Re tla u bolella kamoo.
But he could speak.	Empa o ne a khona ho bua.
The picture is like that.	Setšoantšo se joalo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ha ho letho le phoso.
Everyone loves her.	E mong le e mong oa mo rata.
See you tomorrow.	Ke tla u bona hosane.
We feel that way.	Re ikutloa joalo.
He did it because he could.	O e entse hobane a ne a ka khona.
Then he told me what had happened.	Eaba o mpolella se etsahetseng.
It has been very good.	E bile molemo haholo.
So why did he ask such a question?	Joale ke hobane’ng ha a ile a mo botsa potso e joalo?
It doesn't really talk to me.	Ha e hlile ha e bue le nna.
One has to make sure that you visit them in a better way.	Motho o lokela ho etsa bonnete ba hore o ba etela ka tsela e betere.
He had a wonderful time.	O bile le nako e monate.
I did the previous one.	Ke entse e ka pele.
I don't know what to do, really.	Ha ke tsebe seo nka se etsang, ruri.
It is already morning.	E se e le hoseng.
I did not know where my children were, or my husband.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na bana ba ka ba hokae, kapa monna oa ka.
The older man thought for a moment.	Monna e moholo a nahana ho se hokae.
But he had not yet gone to the sun.	Empa o ne a ntse a e-so ka a ea le letsatsi.
To be honest, he was almost completely insensitive.	Ho bua 'nete, o ne a batla a se na maikutlo ho hang.
He was just starting to ask.	O ne a qala ho botsa.
I think what they say is true.	Ke nahana hore seo ba se buang ke 'nete.
It was hard for them, but they loved it.	E ne e le thata ho bona, empa ba ne ba e rata.
It is not just a product.	Ha se tlhahiso feela.
She looks very happy now.	O bonahala a thabile haholo hona joale.
It felt strong, it came back.	E ne e ikutloa e le matla, e khutlela morao.
He did the same with some of their things.	O ile a etsa se tšoanang ka lintho tse ling tsa bona.
In the same way.	Ka tsela e tšoanang.
Some come a lot, some come a little.	Ba bang ba tla haholo, ba bang ba tla hanyane.
They will expect too much.	Ba tla lebella tse ngata haholo.
Then he knew that was not the case.	Joale a tseba hore ha ho joalo.
At what time of day should we meet?	Re lokela ho kopana ka nako efe ea letsatsi?
There is so much news out there.	Ho na le litaba tse ngata haholo moo.
I would hear something.	Ke ne ke tla utloa ho hong.
Or maybe it is.	Kapa mohlomong ho joalo.
You can work a little harder and still get better.	O ka sebetsa hanyane haholo mme o ntse o fumana molemo.
Every dog ​​has his day.	Ntja e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le letsatsi la eona.
It makes riding even more fun.	E etsa hore ho palama ho be monate le ho feta.
It found that the mistake was not serious.	E fumane hore phoso e ne e se kotsi.
What it probably does.	Seo mohlomong e se etsang.
I will not be so hard.	Nke ke ka ba thata hakaalo.
She heard them in the front room.	O ile a li utloa ka phaposing e ka pele.
They could get where they wanted to go.	Ba ne ba ka fihla moo ba batlang ho ea teng.
His wife and children were there.	Mosali oa hae le bana ba ne ba le teng moo.
They take it.	Ba e nka.
But that was not the case.	Empa e ne e se kamoo lintho li ileng tsa tsamaea kateng.
This is what he wants.	Sena ke sona seo a se batlang.
But it is there.	Empa e teng moo.
I think.	Ke nahana.
I soon got into trouble and fixed it.	Kapele ke ile ka fumana mathata ’me ka a lokisa.
That he would pay them for this.	Hore o ne a tla ba lefa bakeng sa sena.
Do not have children just to be with them.	U se ke ua ba le bana hore feela u be le bona.
I found something today.	Ke fumane ho hong kajeno.
She did not know what it was like to be a mother.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ho ba 'mè ho joang.
It is their idea.	Ke mohopolo wa bona.
It does the work and then goes away.	E etsa mosebetsi ebe oa tsamaea.
It was incredibly beautiful.	E ne e le ntle ka mokhoa o makatsang.
They are the best they can give to anyone.	Ke tse molemo ka ho fetisisa tseo ba lokelang ho fana ka tsona ho mang kapa mang.
Do not refuse.	U se ke ua hana.
His best days were a few years earlier.	Matsatsi a hae a molemo ka ho fetisisa a ne a le lilemo tse 'maloa pele.
You don't want to beg, you just want to take.	Ha o batle ho kopa, o batla ho nka feela.
As a young man, he had not grasped this fact.	Ha e sa le mohlankana, o ne a e-s'o utloisise seo.
Everything was important.	Tsohle e ne e le tsa bohlokoa.
Good news, but somehow it won't come out right.	Taba e monate, empa ka tsela e itseng e ke ke ea tsoa hantle.
I don't like to see things like that.	Ha ke rate ho bona lintho tse joalo.
I think it worked in the end.	Ke nahana hore e ile ea sebetsa qetellong.
I just got back home when you arrived.	Ke sa tsoa khutlela hae ha u fihla.
Everyone was talking to us.	Bohle ba ne ba bua le rona.
But he did not stop.	Empa ha a ka a ema.
Most people have only one.	Batho ba bangata ba na le e le 'ngoe feela.
He is there to give.	O teng ho fana.
This is my favorite time to visit here.	Ena ke nako eo ke e ratang haholo ea ho etela mona.
Then it started.	Eaba e qala.
The children were there.	Bana ba ne ba le teng.
Did he really mean it?	Na o ne a hlile a bua ka eena?
She has.	O na le.
The second problem is unemployment.	Bothata ba bobeli ke ho hloka mosebetsi.
It can, of course.	E ka khona, ehlile.
It really wasn't a question.	E ne e hlile e se potso.
I heard about it.	Ke utloile ka eona.
We tried several times until he got it right.	Re ile ra leka ka makhetlo a 'maloa ho fihlela a e fumana hantle.
All you can have.	Sohle seo u ka bang le sona.
He must return tomorrow.	O lokela ho khutla hosane.
Come to Mom, Dad.	Tlo ho Mme, Ntate.
Girl and boy.	Ngoanana le moshanyana.
All people are just emotional people.	Batho bohle ke batho ba nang le maikutlo feela.
Do the same with him.	Etsa joalo ka eena.
I do not understand why.	Ha ke utloisise lebaka la hore na ke hobane'ng.
He really said it more than once.	O hlile a e bua ho feta hang.
We loved her very much.	Re ne re mo rata haholo.
He was present at this time.	O ne a le teng ka nako ena.
But a little more.	Empa hanyane hape.
I wanted to get out.	Ke ne ke batla ho tsoa.
Everyone, except me.	E mong le e mong, ntle le nna.
You made me a better person.	U entse hore ke be motho ea molemo.
He is no longer sure of anything.	Ha a sa na bonnete ba letho.
Not so.	Haho joalo.
I can spend my time with people better than you.	Nka qeta nako ea ka le batho ba betere ho u feta.
It is clear how he feels.	Ho hlakile hore na o ikutloa joang.
Also, please do not use the first or second person.	Hape, ka kopo u se ke ua sebelisa motho oa pele kapa oa bobeli.
For the day.	Bakeng sa letsatsi.
At that moment, she met someone.	Ka nako eo, o ile a kopana le motho e mong.
I really think they should take it.	Ke hlile ke nahana hore ba lokela ho e nka.
You only have to do both.	U lokela ho etsa bobeli feela.
That is very important to us.	Seo ke sa bohlokoa haholo ho rona.
Or you have had it.	Kapa u bile le eona.
There will be more to this.	Ho tla ba le ho feta ho sena.
You must love.	U tlameha ho rata.
Same doctor, same procedure.	Ngaka e tšoanang, mokhoa o tšoanang.
It was not because he wanted to be close to her.	E ne e se hobane a ne a batla ho ba haufi le eena.
So let me do it.	Kahoo e re ke etse joalo.
You get nothing.	Ha o fumane letho.
But if they leave, that will be the decision they make.	Empa haeba ba tsamaea, eo e tla ba qeto eo ba e etsang.
Application from location to enter.	Kopo ho tloha sebakeng ho kena ho eona.
Let people say what they want.	Tlohela batho hore ba bue kamoo ba batlang kateng.
I don't think so.	Ke nka hore le uena ha u joalo.
There is something in common.	Ho na le ntho eo re tšoanang ka eona.
They would take care of it.	Ba ne ba tla e hlokomela.
More than that it was very difficult.	Ho feta hoo ho ne ho le boima haholo.
You did them well.	U li entse hantle.
I just want to feel good and healthy.	Ke batla feela ho ikutloa hantle le ho phela hantle.
However, one thing seems clear.	Leha ho le joalo, ntho e le 'ngoe e bonahala e hlakile.
Decide what to do and how to do it.	Etsa qeto ea hore na u etse eng le hore na u etse joang.
A man and a woman entered.	Ho ile ha kena monna le mosali.
Yes, you heard that.	E, u utloile seo.
Obviously he was working.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a sebetsa.
It's yours.	Ke ea hau.
The boy could not speak.	Moshanyana o ne a ke ke a bua.
If you need help, look at one of the others.	Haeba u hloka thuso, sheba e mong oa ba bang.
He did not want trouble.	O ne a sa batle mathata.
I had to move on with my daily life.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho tsoela pele ka bophelo ba letsatsi le letsatsi.
Then they bought a new car!	Joale ba ile ba reka koloi e ncha!
Helping people.	Ho thusa batho.
However I tried.	Leha ho le joalo ke ile ka leka.
She almost looks a little happy with it.	O batla a shebahala a thabile hanyane ke eona.
I really did.	Ke hlile ke entse joalo.
So there is nothing to be afraid of.	Kahoo ha ho letho leo u lokelang ho le tšaba.
Who told me he couldn't tell me.	Ea ileng a mpolella hore ha a khone ho mpolella.
On that day.	Ka letsatsi leo.
I have.	Ke na le.
This has been a problem for a long time.	Sena e bile bothata ka nako e telele.
He was tired.	O ne a khathetse.
It’s something you have.	Ke ntho eo u nang le eona.
I loved him very much.	Ke ne ke mo rata hantle.
That is all he needs.	Ke sona feela seo a se hlokang.
It's just his way of speaking.	Ke mokhoa oa hae oa ho bua feela.
It can be important.	E ka ba bohlokoa.
That's what they want, and they have it.	Ke seo ba se batlang, mme ba na le sona.
It's too close.	Le haufi haholo.
That's it.	Ke eona eo.
I need to come back.	Ke hloka ho khutla.
This coffee is very good.	Kofi ena e ntle haholo.
He said a pretty good place.	O itse sebaka se setle se setle.
Good job!	Mosebetsi o motle!
I knew more than that.	Ke ne ke tseba ho feta moo.
It’s a good time to decide what worked and what didn’t.	Ke nako e ntle ea ho etsa qeto ea hore na ke eng e ileng ea sebetsa le e sa kang ea sebetsa.
If you give them something, they will want more.	Haeba u ba fa ho hong, ba tla batla ho feta.
And instead we found this.	Mme ho ena le hoo re fumane sena.
Don't say that now.	O seke wa bolela seo ha jwale.
There is no ground.	Ha ho na fatše.
But it will come.	Empa e tla tla.
That's you.	Ke uena eo.
Moreover, it is very good for you.	Ho feta moo, e ntle haholo ho uena.
He was just equal in strength.	O ne a lekana feela le matla.
Then lie down.	Ebe u robala fatše.
Handless.	E se nang matsoho.
Otherwise, it will never win.	Ntle ho moo, e ke ke ea hlola.
We always wanted to work.	Kamehla re ne re batla ho sebetsa.
Children will love it.	Bana ba tla e rata.
We think a second one could happen.	Re nahana hore ea bobeli e ka etsahala.
You are sure of this.	O na le bonnete ba sena.
His people did not do so.	Batho ba hae ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
In others,	Ho tse ling,
No one has time to read anymore.	Ha ho sa na motho ea nang le nako ea ho bala.
He started working.	A qala ho sebetsa.
However, this too was not enough.	Leha ho le joalo le hona ho ne ho sa lekana.
I didn't just want that life.	Ke ne ke sa batle bophelo boo feela.
When we buy.	Ha re reka.
Similarly,	Ka ho tšoanang,
Or, you can ask that last question.	Kapa, ​​o ka botsa potso eo ea ho qetela.
Eventually they all came out.	Qetellong ba ile ba tsoa kaofela.
There was nobody here.	Ho ne ho se motho mona.
We will go the way.	Re tla tsamaea ka tsela.
Can you swim?	A na u khona ho sesa?
It seems to work.	E bonahala e sebetsa.
Many people were afraid of him.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba mo tšaba haholo.
And then, it's not good.	Mme ebe, ha e ntle.
It seems like both can happen, but we're not sure.	Ho bonahala eka bobeli ba tsona bo ka etsahala, empa ha re na bonnete.
His life has never been better.	Ha ho mohla bophelo ba hae bo kileng ba ba monate.
Sometimes this can be weird.	Ka linako tse ling tsena e ka ba tse makatsang.
However, some believe it is time to move on.	Leha ho le joalo, ba bang ba lumela hore ke nako ea ho tsoela pele.
This is not enough.	Sena ha sea lekana.
I have to write this.	Ke tlameha ho ngola sena.
Also in that year.	Hape selemong seo.
The legs are not there at all.	Maoto ha a eo ho hang.
Someone who didn't want her here.	Motho ya neng a sa mo batle mona.
You will always love him.	O tla dula o mo rata.
It's the simplest picture you can think of.	Ke setšoantšo se bonolo feela seo u ka se nahanang.
However, any method without problems.	Leha ho le joalo, mokhoa leha e le ofe o se nang mathata.
My mother loved to be a mother.	’Mè o ne a rata ho ba ’mè.
I really met you.	Ka 'nete ke kopane le uena.
You look nice.	O shebahala hantle.
That would be just fine.	Eo e ka bang hantle feela.
We used to swim it.	Re ne re tloaetse ho e sesa.
I knew.	Ke ne ke tseba.
That should be enough.	Seo se ne se lokela ho lekana.
Try to see how you like it.	Leka ho bona hore na u e rata joang.
See if he comes back.	Bona hore na oa khutla.
We were not sure until the end.	Re ne re sa tsebe hantle ho fihlela qetellong.
You do not want it.	Ha o e batle.
It has nothing.	Ha e na letho.
I did not look.	Ha kea ka ka sheba.
Life often seems pointless.	Hangata bophelo bo bonahala bo se na thuso.
I did the same.	Le 'na ke entse joalo.
We decided it wasn't too bad so we started.	Re ile ra etsa qeto ea hore ha ho mpe hakaalo kahoo ra qala.
I didn't know how to do it.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ho e etsa.
They would have to reunite.	Ba ka be ba ile ba tlameha ho kopana hape.
I thought it was just a big party.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke mokete o moholo feela.
I think over time you will feel better.	Ke nahana hore ha nako e ntse e ea u tla ikutloa u le betere.
He’s that kind of player.	Ke sebapali sa mofuta oo.
I would call everyone tomorrow.	Ke ne ke tla letsetsa e mong le e mong hosane.
This, of course, is not the case here.	Sena, ehlile, ha se joalo mona.
Yet similar questions remain.	Leha ho le joalo lipotso tse tšoanang li ntse li le teng.
We have to go now.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea hona joale.
So don’t let them search your car.	Kahoo u se ke ua ba lumella ho batla koloi ea hau.
None of this will be easy.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsena e tla ba bonolo.
However, he was glad he came.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a thabela hore ebe o ile a tla.
You can only get one chance, you may not get it.	O ka fumana monyetla o le mong feela, o ka nna wa se o fumane.
I'm glad you're with me.	Ke thabela hore ebe o na le nna.
He did not receive that kind of money.	O ne a sa fumana chelete e joalo.
I thought you might like it too.	Ke ne ke nahana hore le uena u ka e rata.
However, it can be long enough.	Leha ho le joalo, e ka ba nako e telele e lekaneng.
Like this.	Joalo ka sena.
We can talk about it right here.	Re ka bua ka eona hona mona.
I decided to try to find and try.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho leka ho fumana le ho leka.
We love them when we see them.	Rea ba rata ha re ba bona.
He should read his book.	O lokela ho bala buka ya hae.
You will not need it.	U ke ke ua e hloka.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
We ride in the back.	Re palama ka morao.
I mean he knows what he's going to say.	Ke bolela hore o tseba seo a tla se bua.
I think you should keep it.	Ke nahana hore o lokela ho e boloka.
I do not go without going once a week.	Ha ke ee ntle le ho ea hang ka beke.
But many others may not.	Empa ba bang ba bangata ba ka 'na ba se ke ba etsa joalo.
Just do that.	O mpe o etse seo.
Let him find you.	E re a u fumane.
It’s hard to see what’s wrong with that.	Ho thata ho bona hore na phoso ke efe ka seo.
That can happen again.	Seo se ka etsahala hape.
It was a banquet hall.	E ne e le ntlo ea mokete.
How fast can we get started?	Re ka qala kapele hakae?
We have to get out.	Re tlameha ho tsoa.
I watched as they came and went.	Ke ile ka ba shebella ha ba fihla ba tsamaea.
You get another car.	U fumana koloi e 'ngoe.
That was your idea.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo oa hau.
I was just beginning to enjoy driving.	Ke ne ke qala ho thabela ho khanna.
It helps, but it doesn't have to.	E thusa, empa ha ho hlokahale.
I know that.	Ke tseba seo.
If you give him time.	Haeba u mo fa nako.
I don't think he gets it.	Ha ke nahane hore oa e fumana.
He said he would enjoy that.	O itse o tla thabela seo.
So we have a long way to go.	Kahoo re na le tsela e telele ka pele ho rona.
They were so heavy that he could not move quickly.	Li ne li le boima hoo a neng a se a sa khone ho tsamaea kapele.
This would be it.	Sena e ne e tla ba sona.
He did not think they could do it at that time.	O ne a sa nahane hore na ba ka mo etsa joang ka nako eo.
I think that would be a lot of fun.	Ke nahana hore seo se tla ba monate haholo.
It was night.	E ne e le bosiu.
Otherwise, she was very pretty.	Ho seng joalo, o ne a le motle haholo.
I just wanted my baby.	Ke ne ke batla ngoana oa ka feela.
I didn't care what you thought at the time.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle maikutlo a hau ka nako eo.
They did not know why.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe lebaka.
However, that was not enough.	Leha ho le joalo, hoo ho ne ho sa lekana.
As long as you can do it.	Ha feela o ka e etsa.
It works well, there are no problems with that.	E sebetsa hantle, ha ho na mathata ka seo.
It was yesterday that day.	E ne e le maobane letsatsi leo.
The decision does not do that.	Qeto ha e etse joalo.
And he realized that it was so.	Mme a hlokomela hore ho ne ho le jwalo.
You have no children	Ha u na bana
Probably not.	Mohlomong ha aa lokela.
It is an easy task.	Ke mosebetsi o bonolo.
He even has my name on it.	O bile o na le lebitso la ka.
I go.	ke ea.
They usually go out at night.	Hangata ba tsamaea bosiu.
Now it is as bad as ever.	Hona joale e mpe joalo ka ha e kile ea ba joalo.
I have a headache.	Ke tšoeroe ke hlooho e bohloko.
They say you can't come.	Ba re ha u khone ho fihla.
We can help you.	Re ka u thusa.
Why don't you know that's a strange thing.	Ke hobane'ng ha u sa tsebe seo ke ntho e makatsang.
I can only read.	Nka mpa ka bala feela.
We take them.	Rea li nka.
I will not tell others.	Nke ke ka bolella ba bang.
I have my mind.	Ke na le kelello ea ka.
I will say that again.	Ke tla bua seo hape.
I know what it means, girl.	Kea tseba hore na e bolela eng, ngoanana.
Looking at it would not take long.	Ho e sheba ho ne ho ke ke ha nka nako e telele.
Sit down head down.	Lula fatše hlooho.
I never want to feel that way again.	Ha ke sa batla ho ikutloa ka tsela eo hape.
This is starting to show in advance.	Sena se qala ho bonahala esale pele.
I wanted to help you.	Ke ne ke batla ho o thusa.
It would be.	E ka ba.
He talks a lot.	O bua haholo.
The last group made me think.	Sehlopha sa ho qetela se ile sa etsa hore ke nahane.
They don't care enough.	Ha ba tsotelle ho lekana.
But then there was a problem.	Empa joale ho ne ho e-na le bothata.
This is your age, son.	Hona ke lilemo tsa hao, mora.
It is always harder and harder.	Ho thata le ho feta kamehla.
I had to talk to him.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho bua le eena.
Road.	Tsela.
He would do anything.	O ne a tla etsa eng kapa eng.
I was talking about what he did.	Ke ne ke bua ka seo a se entseng.
It is not just hard work at all.	Ha se feela ho sebetsa ka thata ho feta ba bang kaofela.
So you were wrong.	Kahoo u bile le phoso.
Some need to pay more than others, of course.	Ba bang ba hloka ho lefa ho feta ba bang, ke 'nete.
Indeed, it is.	Ka sebele, ho joalo.
I am an adult.	Ke moholo.
We do as much as we can.	Re etsa kamoo re ka khonang.
I can't think of anything else.	Ha ke khone ho nahana ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
But after my time.	Empa ka mor'a nako ea ka.
The local people would no longer be looking for him there.	Batho ba sebakeng seo ba ne ba ke ke ba hlola ba mo batla moo.
In the head and news.	Ka hlooho le litaba.
Bad news goes fast.	Litaba tse mpe li tsamaea kapele.
They told us where to go, we had to do it.	Ba re boleletse hore na re ee kae, re tlameha ho e etsa.
We have a lot of good things.	Re na le lintho tse ngata tse ntle.
She started to cry again.	A qala ho lla hape.
Do not read too much.	U se ke ua e bala haholo.
I would know the truth!	Ke ne ke tla tseba 'nete!
They would pay.	Ba ne ba tla lefa.
It wasn't going to go away, of course.	E ne e sa tl'o tsamaea, ehlile.
But it may not be too long.	Empa ho ka 'na ha se ke ha e-ba le nako e ngata.
At the end of the day.	Qetellong ea letsatsi.
The house needs people in it.	Ntlo e hloka batho ho eona.
I spent many hours playing with them as a child.	Ke ne ke qeta lihora tse ngata ke bapala le bona ha ke sa le ngoana.
I also do not know how they will work.	Le 'na ha ke tsebe hore na li tla sebetsa joang.
He was with her.	O ne a e-na le eena.
And it continues to do so.	'Me e tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
I had no idea about this.	Ke ne ke sa nahana ka taba ena.
He did not expect that question.	O ne a sa lebella potso eo.
We will definitely be back.	Ka sebele re tla khutla.
Or who he was.	Kapa e ne e le mang.
Many of them were new at the time.	Tse ngata tsa tsona li ne li le ncha ka nako eo.
But we have to understand what is happening.	Empa re tlameha ho utloisisa hore na ho etsahalang.
But we are still doing that.	Empa re ntse re etsa joalo.
A very important issue.	Taba ea bohlokoa ruri.
He was arrested.	O ile a tšoaroa.
I would appreciate any help.	Ke tla thabela thuso efe kapa efe.
Very early in the morning.	Hoseng haholo.
Now, we have to do it this way.	Jwale, re lokela ho etsa ka tsela ena.
He would have to open the door.	O ne a tla tlameha ho bula lemati.
I need this.	Ke hloka sena.
He knew it was better to go to bed early.	O ne a tseba hore ho molemo ho robala kapele.
Situation is everything.	Boemo ke ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
I'm really happy to be back.	Ka sebele ke thabetse ho khutlela morao.
We did just that.	Re ile ra etsa joalo.
This is useful for their condition and condition.	Sena se na le thuso bakeng sa boemo ba bona le boemo ba bona.
He cares for her too.	Le eena oa mo hlokomela.
It can no longer exist.	E ke ke ea hlola e e-ba teng.
You really deserve it.	O hlile o lokela.
He found it the most fun.	O ile a fumana e le monate ka ho fetisisa.
And I saw you and your life.	Mme ke bone wena le bophelo ba hao.
He would learn to be tough and live.	O ne a tla ithuta ho ba thata le ho phela.
If you do not understand a question, please ask again.	Haeba u sa utloisise potso, ka kopo botsa hape.
And this is the issue here.	'Me sena ke taba mona.
I wanted to go back home.	Ke ne ke batla ho khutlela hae.
Sometimes we did that.	Ka linako tse ling re ne re etsa joalo.
He was very happy.	O ne a thabile haholo.
He loved it so much.	O ne a e rata haholo.
Everything was working fine.	Lintho tsohle li ne li sebetsa hantle.
I love watching him work.	Ke rata ho mo shebella a sebetsa.
They are mine.	Ke tsa ka.
If you don't like it, fine.	Haeba u sa e rate, hantle.
But otherwise the room was empty.	Empa ntle le moo kamore eo e ne e se na letho.
One, you think you will never be able to get out.	E 'ngoe, u nahana hore u ke ke ua khona ho tsoa.
This helped a lot.	Sena se ile sa thusa haholo.
I knew this was it.	Ke ne ke tseba hore sena ke sona.
Someone has to say it.	Ho na le motho ea lokelang ho e bua.
It does not see the problem.	Ha se bona bothata.
I find all of that very difficult.	Ke fumana tseo tsohle li le thata haholo.
I did so once.	Ke ile ka etsa joalo hang.
I really don’t think so.	Ha ke hlile ha ke nahane joalo.
It was his fault.	E ne e le phoso ya hae.
However, I am not a party girl.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke ngoanana oa mokete.
Thanks for the help.	Re leboha thuso.
Was it so.	Na ho ne ho le joalo.
It is a great opportunity.	Ke monyetla o moholo.
Anything you need.	Eng kapa eng eo u e hlokang.
This is not a walking area but is very close to a car.	Sena ha se sebaka sa ho tsamaea empa se haufi haholo le koloi.
Do you understand?	A na u oa utloisisa?
I've heard of such things before.	Ke utloile ka lintho tse joalo pele.
Your age is very important to me, it is all a matter of opinion.	Lilemo tsa hau li bohlokoa haholo ho 'na, tsohle ke taba ea maikutlo.
I think you can do him a favor.	Ke nahana hore o ka mo etsetsa molemo.
It will be.	E tla ba.
One to live, one to live.	E mong ho phela, e mong ho phela.
He says that.	O bolela seo.
Obviously this is not the case.	Ho hlakile hore sena ha se joalo.
I did not play well.	Ha kea bapala hantle.
They talked about me.	Ba ne ba bua ka nna.
From his team.	Ho tsoa sehlopheng sa hae.
People learn and forget.	Batho ba ithuta mme ba lebala.
That was definitely true for me.	Ruri seo e ne e le ’nete ho ’na.
We'll think of something else.	Re tla nahana ka se seng.
I'll get there later.	Ke tla fihla moo ka mora nako.
People seem to be too tired to keep crying.	Batho ba bonahala ba khathetse haholo hore ba ka lula ba lla.
Many children just wanted to play.	Bana ba bangata ba ne ba batla ho bapala feela.
He plays us.	Oa re bapala.
You will never get it.	Le ka mohla u ke ke ua e fumana.
I had no family.	Ke ne ke se na lelapa.
Our room was not too bad.	Kamore ea rona e ne e se mpe haholo.
To many, that might sound farfetched.	Ba bangata ba ka 'na ba nka hore ke ntho e makatsang.
However, that does not have to be.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho hlokahale hore ho be joalo.
There is not much you can do about it.	Ha ho na lintho tse ngata tseo u ka li etsang ka eona.
But it is there.	Empa e teng.
Where it is.	Moo e leng teng.
It didn't work.	E ne e se sebetsa.
One is new.	E 'ngoe ke e ncha.
I don't have to talk to you.	Ha ke a tlameha ho bua le wena.
But even here.	Empa le mona.
It's actually very simple.	Ha e le hantle ho bonolo haholo.
That is, to believe it or not, he really was.	E leng hore, ho lumela kapa che, o ne a hlile a le joalo.
What we do well.	Seo re se etsang hantle.
But eventually they will understand it.	Empa qetellong ba tla e utloisisa.
He refused to tell me.	O ne a hana ho mpolella.
Parents go with their children.	Batsoali ba tsamaea le bana ba bona.
Plus, more than that, he would try almost anything.	Ho feta moo, ho feta moo, o ne a tla leka hoo e ka bang eng kapa eng.
They are not coming back.	Ha ba sa khutla.
Try to keep learning, learning.	Leka ho lula u ntse u ithuta, u ntse u ithuta.
You may want to read it first.	U ka 'na ua batla ho bala eona pele.
Now, of course, it would probably be a lot better.	Joale, ehlile, mohlomong e ka ba betere haholo.
You will probably buy a new car next year.	Mohlomong o tla reka koloi e ncha selemong se tlang.
It is a place we have been to before.	Ke sebaka seo re kileng ra ba ho sona pele.
Or sleeping.	Kapa ho robala.
I do not want this.	Ha ke batle sena.
He ate a lot of good food.	O ile a ja lijo tse ngata tse monate.
He did not get it.	Ha a ka a e fumana.
Speaking at night.	Ho bua bosiu.
I know we can.	Kea tseba hore re ka khona.
The law.	Molao.
They are stronger.	Ba matla ho feta.
That's because it did.	Ke hobane e entse joalo.
I hope that has been helpful in some way.	Ke tšepa hore hoo ho bile molemo ka tsela e itseng.
Every morning you should have a delicious breakfast.	Hoseng ho hong le ho hong o lokela ho ja lijo tsa hoseng tse monate.
There are not many things you can say.	Ha ho na lintho tse ngata tseo u ka li buang.
I have to get there.	Ke tlameha ho fihla.
I always drink coffee in the morning.	Ke lula ke noa kofi hoseng.
No one had to tell me anything.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tlameha ho mpolella letho.
You get the time.	U fumana nako.
But now he has to get out.	Empa joale o tlameha ho tsoa.
This is another one.	Ena ke e 'ngoe.
I live next to them.	Ke lula haufi le bona.
But it really does not matter here.	Empa ha e le hantle ha se taba mona.
That's hard, man.	Ho leng thata, monna.
Or someone, for that matter.	Kapa motho, bakeng sa taba eo.
You did not ask for any of this.	Ha ua ka ua kopa letho la sena.
You know, do whatever they want.	Ua tseba, etsa eng kapa eng eo ba e batlang.
This is not easy for him.	Sena ha se bonolo ho eena.
She stared at him looking at her phone.	O ile a mo shebella a sheba mohala oa hae.
Maybe that didn't help either.	Mohlomong le hoo ha hoa ka ha thusa letho.
I don't know who your mother was.	Ha ke tsebe hore na mme wa hao e ne e le mang.
We like to talk more, and we will talk in the future.	Re rata ho bua haholoanyane, 'me re tla bua nakong e tlang.
Let's talk about it.	O re re bue ka eona.
I will be with you.	Ke tla ba le uena.
I refused, of course.	Ke ile ka hana, ho hlakile.
It was an easy mistake to make.	E ne e le phoso e bonolo ho e etsa.
You will not be able to return there for many years.	U ke ke ua khona ho khutlela moo ka lilemo tse ngata.
The reason was simple.	Lebaka le ne le le bonolo.
He stopped and looked at her.	A ema a mo sheba.
We needed to talk.	Re ne re hloka ho bua.
He did not want to do anything about it.	O ne a sa batle ho etsa letho ka mosebetsi ona.
I mean, if anyone has a chance, say yes.	Ke bolela, haeba mang kapa mang a na le monyetla, e re e.
You will start looking for someone else.	O tla qala ho batla motho e mong.
It was delicious food.	E ne e le lijo tse monate.
Then it went back.	Eaba e khutlela morao.
Or more than that.	Kapa ho feta ho feta.
I do not know who.	Ha ke tsebe mang.
Then he had the first name to write.	Joale o ne a e-na le lebitso la pele leo a lokelang ho le ngola.
They knew what they were doing and their work was very good.	Ba ne ba tseba seo ba se etsang ’me mosebetsi oa bona o ne o le motle haholo.
He said no.	O itse ha ho joalo.
Of course, it was enough.	Ehlile, e ne e lekana.
So it all works out.	Kahoo tsohle li tsoela pele ho sebetsa.
Of course, the news is not just bad.	Ha e le hantle, litaba ha li mpe feela.
Write your books.	Ngola libuka tsa hau.
But there was no point in any of them.	Empa ho ne ho se na molemo oa letho ho e mong oa bona.
I have my own.	Ke na le ea ka.
We hope you find this useful.	Re tšepa hore u ka fumana sena se le molemo.
He certainly did not tell me.	Ka sebele ha aa ka a mpolella eona.
He certainly did not think so well.	Ruri o ne a sa nahane taba ena hantle.
You can use any method of handling.	U ka sebelisa mokhoa ofe kapa ofe oa ho tšoara.
There was something he knew about her.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho eo a e tsebang ka eena.
But they are usually not the best.	Empa hangata ha se tsona tse ntle ka ho fetisisa.
You do not love your husband.	Ha o rate monna wa hao.
It is usually very close.	Hangata e haufi haholo.
We used to do that.	Re ne re tloaetse ho etsa joalo.
The old car continued.	Koloi ea khale e ile ea tsoela pele.
It all came together very well.	Tsohle li ile tsa kopana hantle haholo.
I will be thinking.	Ke tla be ke ntse ke nahana.
And that this can happen often.	Le hore sena se ka etsahala hangata.
I made money like that.	Ke fumane chelete joalo.
He knew what to do.	O ne a tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
But if he is.	Empa haeba a le teng.
With that he could say or say nothing.	Ka seo o ne a ka se bua kapa a ke ke a bua letho.
None of them had anything bad to say.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a e-na le ntho e mpe eo a ka e buang.
He entered.	A kena.
He went to look, and there he was.	A ya ho sheba, mme a mo fumana.
If you are unsure, take one.	Haeba o sena bonnete, nka e le 'ngoe.
Now, he thought.	Jwale, a nahana.
Or more.	Kapa ho feta moo.
We could not see the way forward.	Re ne re sa bone tsela ea ho ea pele.
Well, well!	Be, hantle!
There is no need to write everything down.	Ha ho hlokahale ho ngola ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe.
Probably never.	Mohlomong le ka mohla.
I'm sorry but it's true.	Ke masoabi empa ke 'nete.
We are going again.	Re ea hape.
You have no power.	Ha o na matla.
He didn't even know what it was.	O ne a se a sa tsebe le hore na ke eng.
I looked at it.	Ke ile ka e sheba.
You are still there.	O ntse o le teng.
You need your car.	U hloka koloi ea hau.
He certainly looked strong.	Ka sebele o ne a shebahala a le matla.
But people do not think so.	Empa batho ha ba nahane joalo.
It was a very tasty meal.	E ne e le lijo tse monate haholo.
There were probably many of them.	Mohlomong ho ne ho e-na le ba bangata ba bona.
One of them is time.	E 'ngoe ea tsona ke nako.
That would never happen again.	Seo se ne se ke ke sa hlola se etsahala.
Che, che, che.	Che, che, che.
They do nothing good.	Ha ba etse letho le molemo.
Maybe it will make me smarter than I am now.	Mohlomong ho tla etsa hore ke be le kelello ho feta hona joale.
From now on.	Tloha jwale.
Then they stood up again.	Eaba ba ema hape.
I really need to get there at some point.	Ke hlile ke hloka ho fihla moo ka nako e itseng.
It can be fun.	E ka ba monate.
Everyone heard it.	E mong le e mong o ile a e utloa.
He wanted to get his driver's license.	O ne a batla ho fumana lengolo la hae la ho khanna.
But after today.	Empa ka mor'a kajeno.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ha se joalo.
They are often shy of people.	Hangata ba lihlong ho batho.
He is always busy.	O dula a phathahane.
We are still working hard.	Re ntse re sebetsa ka thata.
He took a day off from work.	O ile a nka letsatsi mosebetsing.
They spent a few hours there.	Ba ile ba qeta lihora tse seng kae moo.
If you see something interesting that you would like to play with, ask.	Haeba u bona ntho e monate eo u ka ratang ho bapala ka eona, botsa.
So it happened.	Kahoo ho ile ha etsahala.
He was kind to his friends.	O ne a le bonolo le metsoalle ea hae.
However often this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo hangata sena ha se joalo.
There was no danger here.	Ho ne ho se kotsi mona.
I think he will be here soon.	Ke nahana hore o tla fihla mona haufinyane.
However, it still needed work.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e ntse e hloka mosebetsi.
He was not much better.	O ne a se betere haholo.
They are no longer there.	Ha ba sa le eo.
I do not think where it is.	Ha ke nahane moo e leng teng.
We think so.	Re nahana joalo.
He sat down immediately.	A dula hang hang.
She never saw her father again.	Ha aa ka a hlola a bona ntate oa hae hape.
Now that is what happens.	Joale ke sona se etsahalang.
You have been very important to many of us.	U bile oa bohlokoa haholo ho ba bangata ba rona.
But he could not think of that.	Empa o ne a sa khone ho nahana ka seo.
I really didn't care.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa tsotelle.
Many are still there.	Ba bangata ba ntse ba le teng.
We are in pain.	Re utloa bohloko.
We have to sleep at night.	Re tlameha ho robala bosiu.
And now we only have this place.	'Me joale re na le sebaka sena feela.
I ride a little.	Ke palama hanyane.
This is an easy task.	Ena ke mosebetsi o bonolo.
I will stay here.	Ke tla lula mona.
Just go easy.	Tsoela ka bonolo feela.
He spoke softly, but he could still hear her.	O ile a bua ka bonolo, empa o ne a ntse a mo utloa.
Must read.	E tlameha ho bala.
It still exists.	E ntse e le teng.
Kick ass!	E monate haholo!
I'm not sure what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke eng.
It was a wonderful day.	E ne e le letsatsi le monate la letsatsi.
And my team did a lot of that.	Mme sehlopha sa ka se entse joalo haholo.
They wanted many things in common.	Ba ne ba batla lintho tse ngata tse tšoanang.
It's a wonderful feeling.	Ke maikutlo a monate.
There was no one.	Ho ne ho se motho.
This is the most difficult situation to date.	Ena ke boemo bo thata ka ho fetisisa ho fihlela joale.
I can't see it.	Ha ke e bone.
I love each and every one of you for who you are.	Ke rata e mong le e mong oa lona ka seo le leng sona.
This was a job, just like any other.	Ona e ne e le mosebetsi, joalo ka o mong.
He rejected my mother.	O ile a hana 'Mè.
We do not know what they can do.	Ha re tsebe seo ba ka se etsang.
In a similar way.	Ka mokhoa o mong o joalo.
Yet he would not have reached her.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a ka be a sa mo fihlela.
Read on for what you want.	Bala ho seo u se batlang.
That's right, yes.	Ho joalo, ee.
There is no reason to think.	Ha ho na lebaka la ho nahana.
I felt bad about it.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko ka eona.
Some of us will try to do something.	Ba bang ba rona re tla leka ho etsa ho hong.
There are several things you want.	Ho na le lintho tse 'maloa tseo u li batlang.
That was the best time ever.	Eo e ne e le nako e ntle ka ho fetisisa.
Thank you so much for saying what you did.	Ke leboha haholo ka ho bua seo u se entseng.
Yes, he can.	E, a ka ba le eena.
I know the first few hours will be tough but they are worth it.	Kea tseba hore lihora tsa pele li tla ba thata empa ke tsa bohlokoa.
I say no, you don't do it.	Ke re che, ha u e etse.
The police found her.	Mapolesa a ile a mo bona.
I do not know him.	Ha ke mo tsebe.
What kind of problems did you have?	U bile le mathata a mofuta ofe?
But then, in the end, it all came together.	Empa joale, qetellong, tsohle li ne li kopana.
She is very shy.	O lihlong haholo.
After all they have seen it all.	Ka mor'a hore bohle ba bone tsohle.
He who loves us is there for us.	Ea re ratang, o teng bakeng sa rōna.
He will come back.	O tla fihla morao.
Check before use.	Sheba pele u sebelisa.
This is what makes it so difficult.	Sena ke sona se etsang hore ho be thata haholo.
I’ve done a few other things, too.	Ke entse lintho tse ling tse seng kae, hape.
Instead, they have said nothing.	Ho e-na le hoo, ha ba e-s’o bue letho.
It is more difficult to leave her husband.	Ho thata ho feta ho tlohela monna oa hae.
Be sure to do their job.	Na u be le bonnete bakeng sa ho etsa hoo ha bona.
They do not.	Ha ba na .
He has been testing her.	O ntse a mo leka.
They are not difficult to find.	Ha li thata ho li fumana.
He wanted to be human, yet he did not want to.	O ne a batla ho ba motho, leha ho le jwalo o ne a sa batle.
You will get yours.	U tla fumana ea hau.
No one else always does that.	Ha ho motho e mong ea etsang joalo kamehla.
But that is not the case today.	Empa ha ho joalo kajeno.
We will stay here until we return.	Re tla lula mona ho fihlela re khutla.
Do not stay in one place for too long.	Se ke oa lula sebakeng se le seng nako e telele haholo.
Yes they are.	Ke 'nete, ba joalo.
Talk to them.	Bua le bona.
Someone has to say what we did.	E mong o lokela ho bolela seo re se entseng.
Or perhaps he would not.	Kapa mohlomong o ne a ke ke a etsa joalo.
He could have been happier, happier, without it.	A ka be a bile a thabile, a thabile ho feta, ntle le eona.
He was already doing very well.	O ne a se a ntse a sebetsa hantle haholo.
It's been days and days.	E bile matsatsi le matsatsi.
I really am.	Ke hlile ke joalo.
That is where we are.	Ke hona moo re leng teng.
I have had several.	Ke bile le tse 'maloa.
I hope that is not true.	Ke tšepa hore seo hase ’nete.
Only a few know that it exists.	Ke ba ’maloa feela ba tsebang hore e teng.
He did not need them to understand more than that.	O ne a sa hloke hore ba utloisise ho feta moo.
Give the man all the money you have!	Fa monna chelete eohle eo u nang le eona!
It has something for everyone.	E na le ho hong bakeng sa motho e mong le e mong.
Or a car ?.	Kapa koloi?.
He makes me do all this.	O etsa hore ke etse tsena tsohle.
I refused that.	Ke ile ka hana seo.
It was clear to me.	E ne e hlakile ho 'na.
What happened to you was bad.	Se etsahetseng ho uena se ne se le mpe.
Just take care of it in time.	Ke feela ho e hlokomela ka nako.
There really isn't much going on here.	Ka 'nete ha ho na lintho tse ngata tse etsahalang mona.
Looking at him.	Ho mo sheba.
See how you do.	Bona hore na u etsa joang.
What did you say?	U itseng?
But that was not enough for him.	Empa seo se ne se sa mo lekana.
I will be fine until morning.	Ke tla phela hantle ho fihlela hoseng.
If you want me to do that.	Haeba u batla hore ke etse joalo.
I plan to go there in a few years.	Ke rera ho ea moo ka mor'a lilemo tse 'maloa.
This is a strange thing.	Sena ke ntho e makatsang.
That is a legal fact.	Eo ke 'nete ea molao.
That’s not what we do with a child.	Ha se seo re se etsang le ngoana.
He decided he wanted me.	O ile a etsa qeto ya hore o batla nna.
There is no water.	Ha ho na metsi.
You can continue logging in.	U ka tsoela pele ho kena.
He said he probably did.	O itse mohlomong o entse joalo.
You will be mine.	U tla ba oa ka.
However, this is a look back.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ke ho sheba morao.
I have never thought about that question.	Ha ke e-s'o nahane ka potso eo.
He says he needs money.	O re o hloka chelete.
And he started out empty-handed.	Mme a qala a se na letho.
But there is.	Empa ho teng.
From this.	Ho tloha ho sena .
I think that day will come soon.	Ke nahana hore letsatsi leo le tla fihla haufinyane.
However, we must take it easy to go back.	Leha ho le joalo, re tlameha ho nka ho le bonolo ho khutlela morao.
House that had seen much better days.	Ntlo e neng e bone matsatsi a betere haholo.
If you can do that, it's very simple, very easy.	Haeba u ka etsa joalo, ho bonolo haholo, ho bonolo haholo.
About a week after the accident.	Hoo e ka bang beke ka mor'a kotsi.
I'm not sure what it is.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ke eng.
He is always very punctual.	O lula a boloka nako haholo.
However, planning ahead can help.	Leha ho le joalo, ho rera esale pele ho ka thusa.
You probably already know this, and you probably don't.	Mohlomong u se u ntse u tseba sena, 'me mohlomong ha u tsebe.
But, they have more.	Empa, ba na le tse ling.
No, he did not.	Che, o ile a etsa qeto.
I knew him.	Ke ne ke mo tseba.
It will not be a surprise to him.	E ke ke ea e-ba ntho e makatsang ho eena.
It makes it easier.	E etsa hore u be bonolo haholoanyane.
However, you do not want it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha u e batle.
And take it as it comes.	'Me e nke kamoo e tlang kateng.
Things like that.	Lintho tse joalo.
I have to say you did an amazing job with this.	Ke tlameha ho re u entse mosebetsi o makatsang ka sena.
I wondered if he understood us.	Ke ne ke ipotsa hore na ebe oa re utloisisa.
They went to see.	Ba ne ba ya bona.
I did not expect that I would ever make him understand.	Ke ne ke sa lebella hore le ka mohla ke tla etsa hore a utloisise.
The rule of law.	Molao oa molao.
He was riding on the ground now.	O ne a ntse a palama fatše joale.
They did not ask questions.	Ha baa ka ba botsa lipotso.
Eventually, he had his way.	Qetellong, o ile a ba le tsela ea hae.
What ?.	Ke eng?.
I know how busy you are.	Kea tseba hore na u phathahane hakae.
There is nothing you can do here.	Ha ho letho leo u ka le batlang mona.
But they never read.	Empa ha ho mohla ba kileng ba bala.
They began to doubt.	Ba ile ba qala ho belaela.
And that is exactly what was needed.	'Me ke sona seo se neng se hlokahala.
The news is that there is no news.	Litaba ke hore ha ho na litaba.
We were there and did that.	Re bile moo mme ra etsa seo.
He had children.	O ne a e-na le bana.
He spent his time reading books.	A qeta nako ea hae a bala libuka.
Please do not play with us.	Ke kopa o seke oa bapala le rona.
He could not speak for hours.	O ile a qeta lihora a sa khone ho bua.
But we need to think about them.	Empa re lokela ho nahana ka tsona.
Think of anything you like.	Nahana ka eng kapa eng eo u e ratang.
Or whether he would want to.	Kapa hore na o ne a tla batla.
It works great for everything.	E sebetsa haholo ho tsohle.
It does not matter when this happens.	Ha ho na taba hore na sena se etsahala neng.
There was no time.	Ho ne ho se na nako.
We are no longer talking.	Ha re sa bua.
I can't think of it that way.	Ha ke khone ho nahana ka eona joalo.
If not, you can.	Haeba ha ho na, u ka khona.
We're just doing something we never thought possible.	Re mpa re etsa ntho eo re neng re sa e nahane.
They can do both.	Ba ka etsa ka bobeli.
I hear them.	Kea ba utloa.
You should not do this.	Ha ua lokela ho etsa sena.
It is not long before we find him.	Ha ho na nako e telele pele re mo fumana.
However, they left.	Leha ho le joalo, ba ile ba tsamaea.
He did very well.	O entse hantle haholo.
Just.	Feela.
Even now I'm not pretty.	Le hona joale ha ke sa le motle.
Eaba,	Eaba,
That was the case with his team.	Ho ne ho le joalo le sehlopha sa hae.
That's the way people like me.	Ke kamoo batho ba ratang hore ke be kateng.
Instead, divert your thinking to good things in life.	Ho e-na le hoo, tlohela ho tsoela pele.
However, it is very old.	Leha ho le joalo, ke khale haholo.
I look at my shoes.	Ke shebella lieta tsa ka.
I will be there to help you when you need it.	Ke tla ba teng ho u thusa ha u hloka.
But over time the disconnect.	Empa ha nako e ntse e ea ho se kopane.
But you still have to think about tomorrow.	Empa u ntse u lokela ho nahana ka hosane.
What would happen?	Ho ne ho tla etsahala’ng?
And that worked.	Mme seo se ile sa sebetsa.
I'm not sure what's going on here.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na ho etsahalang mona.
I don't have much more to say about the truth.	Ha ke na tse ling tse ngata tseo nka li buang ka 'nete.
You refuse to see it in this.	U hana ho bona ka sena.
That was my truth.	Eo e ne e le 'nete ea ka.
Never do this.	Le ka mohla etsa sena.
He knew the place and the people.	O ne a tseba sebaka seo le batho.
I love reading about it.	Ke rata ho bala ka eona.
Because I was not the only one.	Hobane e ne e se nna feela.
I need help.	Ke kopa thuso.
I feel very good.	Ke utloa hore o motle haholo.
I have to be there.	Ke lokela ho ba teng.
It was late at night.	E ne e se e le bosiu.
Still, he wanted to hear them.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a batla ho ba utloa.
It doesn't even make sense.	E bile ha e etse kelello.
It is the ability to eat.	Ke ho tseba ho ja.
Then tell me.	Ebe o mpolella.
More than he knew about her.	Ho feta kamoo a neng a tseba ka eena.
I do not want to stay here.	Ha ke batle ho dula mona.
No one looked at us again.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a re sheba hape.
Stay with me.	E-ba le 'na.
Such a beautiful style and style.	Mokhoa o motle joalo le mokhoa.
I don’t do that much.	Ha ke etse joalo haholo.
What happens, it happens.	Se etsahalang, se etsahala.
And they used to be.	Mme ba kile ba ba teng.
Then we will know more.	Joale re tla tseba haholoanyane.
Thank you in advance for all your help.	Ke leboha esale pele bakeng sa thuso ea hau kaofela.
If they can do it, so can you.	Haeba ba khona ho e etsa, le uena u ka khona.
His father was a doctor.	Ntate oa hae e ne e le ngaka.
That image no longer works.	Setšoantšo seo ha se sa sebetsa.
They drove at night and finally arrived.	Ba ile ba khanna bosiu ’me qetellong ba fihla.
He just mentioned it.	O sa tsoa e bolela.
He works hard to provide for his family.	O sebetsa ka thata ho hlokomela lelapa la hae.
Some people really liked it, and still wished it could be there.	Batho ba bang ba ne ba hlile ba e rata, ’me ba ntse ba lakatsa eka e ka be e le teng.
We will try to fix this.	Re tla leka ho lokisa sena.
It must have been too late.	E tlameha ebe e se e le morao haholo.
But he did.	Empa o ile a etsa joalo.
Some are returning.	Ba bang baa khutla.
It takes precedence over anything else.	E nka sebaka sa pele ho feta ntho leha e le efe e 'ngoe.
He was very understanding.	O ne a utloisisa haholo.
We will do as little as we can.	Re tla etsa hanyane kamoo re ka khonang.
You have a lot to say.	U na le lintho tse ngata tseo u ka li buang.
I felt.	Ke ile ka ikutloa .
It certainly would.	Ka sebele ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
Or, they can be easy to do.	Kapa, ​​​​li ka ba bonolo ho li etsa.
Over time.	Ho feta nako.
And we need your help.	'Me re hloka thuso ea hau.
It starts well and works well.	E qala hantle mme e sebetsa hantle.
Do you realize what you are doing?	Na u hlokomela seo u se etsang?
This is you first of all the things that make you.	Sena ke uena pele ho tsohle tse etsahalang tse etsang hore u.
I have food for you.	Ke na le lijo bakeng sa hau.
Keep an ear out.	Boloka tsebe.
This will be even more difficult.	Sena se tla ba thata le ho feta.
And it works well.	'Me e sebetsa hantle.
Man on his own.	Motho ka tsa hae.
He said, "It is you."	A re, ke uena.
He did it for her.	O mo entse joalo.
If you can find it, go.	Haeba u ka e fumana, tsamaea.
Everyone seems to be something to you.	E mong le e mong o bonahala eka ke ntho ho uena.
However, they are still important.	Leha ho le joalo, li ntse li le bohlokoa.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
I didn't even understand what was happening to me.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise le hore na ho etsahala’ng ka ’na.
He decided.	O ile a etsa qeto.
This is not for us.	Sena ha se che ho rona.
He knew he had to work fast.	O ne a tseba hore o tlameha ho sebetsa kapele.
Here's what you need to know.	Sena ke seo u lokelang ho se tseba.
We have seen this before.	Re bone sena pele.
However, there were also problems here.	Leha ho le joalo, le mona ho bile le mathata.
But help was at hand.	Empa thuso e ne e le haufi.
I was very tired.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo.
Tell everyone what we do.	Bolella bohle seo re se etsang.
They do not know where to go.	Ha ba tsebe moo ba lokelang ho ya teng.
He did not pass.	Ha a ka a feta.
Nothing passed him by.	Ha ho letho le ileng la mo feta.
Now he knew why.	Joale o ne a tseba lebaka.
But they do not have to be.	Empa ha ba a tlameha ho ba jwalo.
I still drink it.	Ke ntse ke e noa.
It just says you don't want it.	E re feela ha u e batle.
Now we know how close they were to getting it.	Joale rea tseba hore na ba ne ba le haufi hakae le ho e fumana.
This is the funniest thing.	Ena ke eona e monate.
Yes, he would come to school.	Ee, o ne a tla fihla sekolong.
I mean strong.	Ke bolela hore ke matla.
You're very attractive.	O motle haholo.
Not a good thing at all.	Ha se ntho e ntle ho hang.
This is very problematic.	Sena se na le bothata haholo.
She knew she was beautiful.	O ne a tseba hore o motle.
I wanted something better.	Ke ne ke batla ho hong ho molemo.
It doesn't even have to be important.	Ha ho hlokahale le hore e be ea bohlokoa.
We do not know for sure.	Ha re tsebe hantle ho eona.
They do what they want from us.	Ba etsa seo ba se batlang ho rona.
We go.	Rea ea.
That is what we are to them.	Ke seo re leng sona ho bona.
He waited until he left.	O ile a ema ho fihlela a tsamaea.
It can't happen.	E ke ke ea etsahala.
I was just beginning to wonder when that would happen.	Ke ne ke qala ho ipotsa hore na hoo ho tla etsahala neng.
He worked hard for a long time.	O ile a sebetsa ka thata nako e telele.
I should not have done it.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho e etsa.
No one had ever seen it come.	Ha ho motho ea neng a e bone e tla.
He was not a big man.	E ne e se monna e moholo.
We passed an old high school.	Re ile ra feta sekolong se phahameng sa khale.
I am a girl.	Ke ngoanana.
It worked well for everyone.	E ile ea sebetsa hantle ho bohle.
I was an adult by then.	Ke ne ke se ke le moholo ka nako eo.
We really enjoyed it.	Re ile ra e thabela haholo.
We left thinking we could win to know we could win.	Re ile ra tloha ho nahana hore re ka hlola ho ea ho tseba hore re ka hlola.
I get feedback every day.	Ke fumana maikutlo letsatsi le leng le le leng.
I think we should go, Mother speaks softly.	Ke nahana hore re tsamaee, 'Mè o bua ka bonolo.
But that was a long time ago.	Empa hoo e ne e le khale haholo.
One day it will be very difficult for you.	Ka letsatsi le leng ho tla ba boima haholo ho uena.
Others also came.	Ba bang le bona ba ile ba tla.
The doctor is always learning something.	Ngaka e lula e ithuta ho hong.
But it is something you can think of.	Empa ke ntho eo o ka nahanang ka eona.
Some things they understood, he knew.	Lintho tse ling tseo ba neng ba li utloisisa, o ne a li tseba.
It was in his mind.	E ne e le ka maikutlo a hae.
I will not do anything wrong.	Ha ke na ho etsa letho le phoso.
They worked alone.	Ba ne ba sebetsa ba le bang.
Still, he enjoys his work.	Leha ho le joalo, o thabela mosebetsi oa hae.
Something strange to us here.	Ntho e makatsang ho rona mona.
But they have things to say, too.	Empa ba na le lintho tseo ba lokelang ho li bua, hape.
I wanted to be sure.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba le bonnete.
And we don't know what to do.	Mme ha re tsebe seo re ka se etsang.
I wonder if you can see this of his.	Kea ipotsa hore na u ka bona sena sa hae.
There is always.	Ho na le kamehla.
However, something else.	Leha ho le joalo, ntho e 'ngoe.
And he actually refused everything.	'Me ha e le hantle o ile a hana tsohle.
They do not have much time.	Ha ba na nako e telele.
It was so.	Ho ne ho le joalo.
Here, in this room.	Mona, ka phaposing ena.
Stop! 	Ema!
He would not have done that.	O ne a ka be a sa etsa seo.
he tried to tell his hands.	a leka ho bolella matsoho a hae.
Wait a minute, boy.	Ema hanyane, moshanyana.
So it was one house.	Kahoo e ne e le ntlo e le 'ngoe.
I was the one who came to the people.	Ke ’na ea ileng a tla ho batho.
Be a better person.	Eba motho ya betere.
My daily life and family are here, too.	Bophelo ba ka ba letsatsi le letsatsi le lelapa bo teng mona, hape.
Of course, that would be strange.	Ha e le hantle, hoo e ka ba ntho e makatsang.
You can't be.	U ke ke ua ba .
He also started talking to me.	Le eena o ile a qala ho bua le ’na.
I have to leave soon.	Ke lokela ho tsamaea haufinyane.
That's what we wanted.	Ke seo re neng re se batla.
It was almost empty.	E ne e batla e se na letho.
He wanted to stay.	O ne a batla ho dula.
He did not want to go there.	O ne a sa batle ho ea moo.
Everyone has things.	Motho e mong le e mong o na le lintho.
I've heard people say it doesn't do anything.	Ke utloile batho ba re ha e etse letho.
Say what you want.	Bolela seo u se batlang.
So, that's very true.	Kahoo, ke 'nete haholo.
We just need your father.	Re mpa re hloka ntate oa hau.
It was just my life.	E ne e le bophelo ba ka feela.
It is difficult to understand.	Ho thata ho utloisisa.
The same is true of him.	Ho joalo le ka eena.
One group went here, another group went there.	Sehlopha se seng se ile mona, sehlopha se seng se ile moo.
It is a way of learning without just reading.	Ke mokhoa o mong oa ho ithuta ntle le ho bala feela.
If you look for help, we do not find help.	Haeba u sheba thuso, ha re fumane thuso.
And their approach will not work.	'Me mokhoa oa bona o ke ke oa sebetsa.
A strange man, but a sweet man.	Monna ea makatsang, empa motho ea monate.
Instead, we should be here.	Ho e-na le hoo, re lokela ho ba teng mona.
Think again.	Nahana hape.
What mattered was what he looked like when he said it.	Ntho ea bohlokoa e ne e le hore na o shebahala joang ha a e bua.
So pretend we know nothing about this group.	Kahoo etsa eka ha re tsebe letho ka sehlopha sena.
You do not know what they are like.	Ha u tsebe hore na ba joang.
He would stop and see what would happen to him.	O ne a tla ema 'me a bone hore na ho tla etsahala'ng ka eena.
She looked at him intently.	A mo sheba ka hloko.
I just want to thank you.	Ke batla ho le leboha feela.
Better yet.	Ho feta hantle.
He had to do this.	O ne a lokela ho etsa sena.
I may never see him again.	Mohlomong nke ke ka hlola ke mo bona hape.
Probably more important than that.	Mohlomong ke ea bohlokoa ho feta moo.
It is very clear.	Ho hlakile haholo.
We couldn’t do the same thing, you know.	Re ne re sa khone ho etsa ntho e le 'ngoe, ua tseba.
Find another way to earn money.	Fumana mokhoa o mong oa ho fumana chelete.
Thank you very much.	Re leboha haholo.
We realize he has a lot of things in school.	Re hlokomela hore o na le lintho tse ngata sekolong.
He is always on time.	O dula a le ka nako.
I stood right behind him.	Ka ema hantle ka mora hae.
Yes, he was.	E, o ne a le teng.
Maybe they have a problem, maybe not.	Mohlomong ba na le bothata, mohlomong ha ho joalo.
I looked at his path.	Ke ile ka sheba tsela ea hae.
We could not do that.	Re ne re ke ke ra etsa joalo.
He knew that law.	O ne a tseba molao oo.
I mean that's just the point.	Ke bolela hore seo ke kelello feela.
Lots of three.	Tse ngata tse tharo.
Anyone could get food when they needed it.	Mang kapa mang o ne a ka fumana lijo ha a li hloka.
I see again.	Ke bona hape.
And no one else knows about it.	'Me ha ho motho e mong ea tsebang ka eona.
Then there were times.	Joale ho ne ho e-na le linako tse ling.
Well, think again.	Be, nahana hape.
They were there to take it.	Ba ne ba le teng ho e nka.
This was not an easy task.	Sena ha sea ka sa e-ba mosebetsi o bonolo.
I want to be with them.	Ke batla ho ba le bona.
You no longer see or hear from anyone.	Ha u sa bona kapa ua utloa ho mang kapa mang.
When you.	Ha u.
Then her father died.	Eaba ntate oa hae oa hlokahala.
The two played well together.	Bobeli ba ile ba bapala hantle hammoho.
We will have food here tonight.	Re tla ba le lijo mona bosiung bona.
And that says a lot.	Mme seo se bua haholo.
I never got a chance to talk to him.	Ke ne ke sa fumane monyetla oa ho bua le eena.
He had never been like that before.	O ne a e-s'o be joalo ka mor'a moo.
He didn't seem to have a name.	O ne a sa bonahale a na le lebitso.
And now they can go over my head.	'Me joale li ka feta hlooho ea ka.
You do not know anyone.	Ha ho motho eo u mo tsebang.
I don’t think you can just go check it out.	Ha ke nahane hore u ka ea feela ho e sheba.
He works long hours every day.	O sebetsa lihora tse telele letsatsi le leng le le leng.
He really is.	Ehlile ke eena.
Nako.	Nako.
The food was delicious.	Lijo li ne li le monate.
Thank you for all your thoughts, ideas and feelings.	Kea le leboha ka maikutlo, maikutlo le maikutlo a hau kaofela.
I feel that way.	Ke ikutloa joalo.
The pain was excruciating.	Bohloko bo ne bo le boima.
Wanna play.	O batla ho bapala.
Make each day worthwhile.	Etsa hore letsatsi le leng le le leng e be la bohlokoa.
I will help you.	Ke tla u thusa.
To do whatever you can do alone.	Ho etsa eng kapa eng eo u ka e etsang u le mong.
But you asked.	Empa u ile ua botsa.
You know that too.	Le wena o tseba seo.
I was devastated.	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko haholo.
She liked to look good.	O ne a thabela ho shebahala a le motle.
He did not want to believe it.	O ne a sa batle ho e lumela.
I didn't need to.	Ke ne ke sa hloke.
Boy and man.	Moshanyana le monna.
I really need you.	Ke hlile kea u hloka.
I'll have to fix some.	Ke tla tlameha ho lokisa tse ling.
And he looked at the others.	Mme a sheba ba bang.
They would do what they wanted.	Ba ne ba tla etsa seo ba se ratang.
But they are not important.	Empa ha li bohlokoa.
I've seen it.	Ke e bone.
The man said nothing.	Monna eo ha a ka a bua letho.
Finally.	Qetellong.
He knew what was going to happen.	O ne a tseba se neng se tla etsahala.
I'm trying to say something else.	Ke leka ho bua ho hong hape.
So many of us were.	Kahoo ba bangata ba rona re ne re le joalo.
Although the work was hard, he was.	Le hoja mosebetsi o ne o le boima, o ne a le .
I knew nothing.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe letho.
As in the picture we made.	Joalo ka setšoantšo seo re se entseng.
They make a lot of money.	Ba etsa chelete e ngata.
Look, mind, work.	Sheba, kelello, mosebetsi.
This is my room, he thought.	Ena ke kamore ea ka, a nahana joalo.
News is what you want.	Litaba ke tseo u li batlang.
But where he came from did not matter.	Empa hore na o ne a tsoa hokae ho ne ho se taba.
Preaching the good news was a challenge.	Ho bolela litaba tse molemo ho ne ho le thata.
He was not even sure if he wanted to.	O ne a se a bile a se na bonnete ba hore o batla ho etsa joalo.
I hope you have a great time.	Ke tšepa hore u na le nako e monate.
Well together.	Hantle hammoho.
The evening started off very pleasant.	Mantsiboea a ile a qala e le monate haholo.
I am here and you must learn to live with me.	Ke mona mme o tlameha ho ithuta ho phela le nna.
.	.
And no one.	Mme ha ho motho.
Whether it will work will be seen.	Hore na e tla sebetsa ho tla bonahala.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
I really need it.	Ke hlile kea e hloka.
Yet we do not see why we cannot sit still.	Leha ho le joalo ha re bone hore na ke hobane'ng ha re sa khone ho lula hanyane.
He knew what to do.	O ne a tseba seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
The task is simple enough for a child to do.	Mosebetsi o bonolo hoo ngoana a ka o etsang.
Yet there was nothing he could do about it.	Leha ho le joalo ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang ka hona.
He had no water.	O ne a sena metsi.
I have a few questions.	Ke na le lipotso tse 'maloa.
He had not spoken since we left my room.	O ne a e-s'o ka a bua ho tloha ha re tsoa kamoreng ea ka.
Nobody knew him.	Ho ne ho se motho ya mo tsebang.
I did not understand how that could happen.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hore na seo se ka etsahala joang.
I wanted to stay.	Ke ne ke batla ho lula.
For so long.	Nako e telele hakana.
For what matters.	Bakeng sa seo e leng sa bohlokoa.
He was not sure it would work.	O ne a sena bonnete ba hore e tla sebetsa.
Just to see if he exists.	Ho bona feela hore na o teng.
But it is not a matter of being alone.	Empa hase taba ea ho ba mong.
I get it now.	Kea e fumana hona joale.
I know that's the problem.	Kea tseba hore ke bothata.
No, we do not.	Che, ha re etse joalo.
Well, it's too late now.	Be, nako e se e le morao haholo jwale.
We can make it better than it ever was.	Re ka etsa hore e be betere ho feta kamoo e neng e le kateng.
So that you are important.	E le hore u ba bohlokoa.
This is your party.	Ena ke mokete oa hau.
He met his mother.	O kopane le mme.
It was beautiful.	E ne e le ntle.
I knew what he was like.	Ke ne ke tseba hore na o joang.
He did not know that it would go away like that.	O ne a sa tsebe hore e tla tloha joalo.
His mind was still working fine.	Kelello ea hae e ne e ntse e sebetsa hantle.
I want to trust him.	Ke batla ho mo tšepa.
I don't know about anyone else.	Ha ke tsebe ka motho e mong.
This book is for everyone.	Buka ena ke ea mang kapa mang le mang kapa mang.
I could handle it alone out here.	Ke ne ke khona ho e tšoara ke le mong ka ntle mona.
They just go home.	Ba ea hae feela.
Or, it did.	Kapa, ​​e entse joalo.
If they had the money, there was no problem.	Haeba ba ne ba e-na le chelete, ho ne ho se bothata.
It is an important condition.	Ke boemo ba bohlokoa.
If he refuses to go, think about leaving without him.	Haeba a hana ho tsamaea, nahana ka ho tsamaea ntle le eena.
This is our life's work.	Ona ke mosebetsi oa rona oa bophelo.
She thinks she is beautiful.	O nahana hore o motle.
I will have to read the book now !.	Ke tla tlameha ho bala buka hona joale!.
That makes it even harder.	Seo se etsa hore ho be thata le ho feta.
I do not think so.	Ha ke nahane joalo.
Then everything he wanted was his.	Joale ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo a neng a e batla e ne e se e le ea hae.
He said nothing.	Ha a ka a bua letho.
Only now he did not sing anything alone.	Feela joale ha aa ka a bina letho a le mong.
Well just for.	Hantle feela bakeng sa.
Many think he will live by it.	Ba bangata ba nahana hore o tla phela ka eona.
Do not make this mistake.	O seke wa etsa phoso ena.
That would not be good for me either.	Le ho nna hoo ho ka se be molemo.
We tried another car.	Re ile ra leka koloi e ’ngoe.
I think that's what they have in common.	Ke nahana hore ke seo ba tšoanang ka sona.
It must have been something of some kind.	E tlameha ebe e ne e le ntho ea mofuta ofe kapa ofe.
Friends are there for friends.	Metsoalle e teng bakeng sa metsoalle.
But it did not start that way.	Empa ha ea ka ea qala ka tsela eo.
Then there it is.	Joale ho teng.
Find a room.	Fumana kamore.
I thought and read and thought some more.	Ke ile ka nahana le ho bala le ho nahana tse ling hape.
I was with someone.	Ke ne ke na le motho.
You have to keep these carefully.	U tlameha ho boloka tsena ka hloko.
It was just right.	E ne e lekana hantle.
I enjoyed life to the full.	Ke ne ke thabela bophelo haholo.
We'll see what happens this week.	Re tla bona se etsahalang bekeng ena.
He would know what happened.	O ne a tla tseba se etsahetseng.
You should treat both in the same way.	U lokela ho tšoara bobeli ka tsela e tšoanang.
There was something wrong here.	Ho ne ho ena le phoso mona.
It's just because.	Ke hobane feela.
This was a great opportunity.	Ona e ne e le monyetla o motle.
Now, maybe, he could do that again.	Jwale, mohlomong, a ka etsa jwalo hape.
You have to keep going.	U tlameha ho lula u tsamaea.
It was a good thing.	E ne e le ntho e ntle.
We stayed there for a few days.	Re ile ra lula moo matsatsi a ’maloa.
And to be present.	Le ho ba teng.
Should desire it.	Lokela ho e lakatsa.
No girl has that name here.	Haho ngoanana ea nang le lebitso leo mona.
That's your problem.	Ke bothata ba hao.
My father will try to come here.	Ntate o tla leka ho tla mona.
One of them would get it.	E mong oa bona o ne a tla e fumana.
This method does not require any special problems.	Mokhoa ona ha o hloke mathata a itseng.
You did not come.	Ha ua tla.
Of course, it is possible.	Ehlile, ho ka etsahala.
However this has not happened.	Leha ho le joalo sena ha sea etsahala.
When life was at stake.	Ha bophelo bo ne bo le kotsing.
If he wished to do this, so be it.	Haeba a ne a lakatsa ho etsa sena, ho be joalo.
They tried to do the same to us but we were strong.	Ba ile ba leka ho etsa se tšoanang ho rōna empa re ne re le matla.
Some may be true.	Tse ling e ka 'na eaba ke 'nete.
But he was already too late.	Empa o ne a se a le morao haholo.
He could see well enough.	O ne a bona hantle ho lekana.
I thought you should know.	Ke ne ke nahana hore o lokela ho tseba.
She started to cry.	A qala ho lla.
You no longer need a reason.	Ha u sa hloka lebaka.
Because we are not.	Hobane ha ho rona.
Also, he knew, it was important now.	Hape, o ne a tseba, e ne e le bohlokoa hona joale.
I still can't write about what happened here.	Ke ntse ke sa khone ho ngola ka se etsahetseng mona.
Things we do without thinking!	Lintho tseo re li etsang ntle le ho nahana!
Indeed, one day he told me to do something.	Ka sebele, ka letsatsi le leng o ile a mpolella hore ke etse ho hong.
I am writing a book but I have a problem.	Ke ngola buka empa ke na le bothata.
Thank you so much for both.	Ke leboha haholo ka bobeli.
I'll see you again.	Ke tla u bona hape.
We have to go now.	Re tlameha ho tsamaea hona joale.
People talk about me.	Batho ba bua ka nna.
He knew he knew.	O ne a tseba hore oa tseba.
I think you are in a very bad way when that happens.	Ke nahana hore o ka tsela e mpe haholo ha seo se etsahala.
You do not even know what it is like for me.	Ha u tsebe le hore na ho joang ho 'na.
Because you want to.	Hobane u batla.
We feel like a person, like an adult, like a woman.	Re ikutloa joaloka motho, joaloka motho e moholo, joaloka mosali.
I go back to doing nothing.	Ke khutlela ho se etse letho.
However, I think you have something.	Leha ho le joalo, ke nahana hore ho na le ntho eo u nang le eona.
I was there this morning.	Ke ne ke le teng hoseng hona.
Both, he thought.	Ka bobeli, o ne a nahana.
I was in the area.	Ke ne ke le sebakeng.
Make it seem like they don't care.	Etsa hore ho bonahale eka ha li na taba.
He decided to do what he did.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho etsa seo a se entseng.
It can't be just me.	E ke ke ea ba 'na feela.
I need to get a job.	Ke hloka ho fumana mosebetsi.
Yet it was a very good thing, after all.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e le ntho e ntle haholo, ka mor'a tsohle.
It is very difficult to drive like that.	Ho thata haholo ho khanna joalo.
However, he still understood.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a ntse a utloisisa.
He knows that very well.	O tseba seo hantle haholo.
We have to leave it there.	Re lokela ho e tlohela moo.
It can't be that bad.	E ka se be mpe hakaalo.
Lots of money.	Chelete e ngata.
Probably him.	Mohlomong eena.
One knows more.	Motho o tseba ho feta.
The police were tired and tired.	Mapolesa a ne a khathetse a bile a khathetse.
I'm fine everywhere.	Ke hantle kae kapa kae.
I'm glad you feel better.	Ke thabela hore ebe o ikutloa o le betere.
That’s what the team does.	Ke seo sehlopha se se etsang.
You play team.	U bapala sehlopha.
None of us.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona.
We have bad news.	Re na le litaba tse mpe.
He was happy, he enjoyed that.	O ne a thabile, a thabela seo.
He is one of us.	Ke e mong wa rona.
But they really liked it.	Empa ba ne ba hlile ba e rata.
He talks a lot about his feelings.	O bua haholo ka maikutlo a hae.
It spends money faster than it does.	E sebelisa chelete kapele ho feta ho e etsa.
Better yet.	Ho molemo ho feta.
It's kind of.	Ke mofuta oa.
I have something important to do.	Ke na le ntho ea bohlokoa eo ke lokelang ho e etsa.
How it would feel to hold you.	Ho ne ho tla ikutloa joang ho u tšoara.
It would not be appropriate.	E ka be e sa lokela.
We will try it your way.	Re tla e leka ka tsela ya hao.
It would have been difficult to remain human.	Ho ka be ho bile thata ho lula e le motho.
I feel good about it right now.	Ke ikutloa ke le monate ho eona hona joale.
That is not good news.	Ha se litaba tse monate joalo.
From now on whatever you say goes.	Ho tloha joale eng kapa eng eo u e buang e ea.
I would definitely do it again.	Ka sebele ke ne ke tla li etsa hape.
And never forget it.	Mme o seke wa e lebala le ka mohla.
And we must eat.	'Me re tlameha ho ja.
He must live.	O tlameha ho phela.
I just needed to be there to help.	Ke ne ke hloka feela ho ba teng ho thusa.
I can't play with them.	Ha ke khone ho bapala le bona.
I'll be back and we'll go.	Ke tla khutla 'me re tla tsamaea.
Nothing happened to these books.	Ha ho letho le etsahetseng ka libuka tsena.
With their help we can do it.	Ka thuso ea bona re ka e etsa.
It was all mine.	E ne e le ea ka kaofela.
You can only take care of the baby.	U ka hlokomela ngoana feela.
Long from now.	Nako e telele ho tloha joale.
I'm afraid he won't get out of it.	Ke tšaba hore a ke ke a tsoa ho eona.
He can go where he wants.	A ka ya moo a ratang teng.
Say you will eat with me tonight.	E re u tla ja le 'na bosiung bona.
He said he had never been there.	O ile a bolela hore ha ho mohla a kileng a ea moo.
There would be nothing left.	Ho ne ho ke ke ha hlola ho e-ba le letho.
Enter the bedroom.	Kena ka kamoreng ea ho robala.
Maybe that's how they were happy together.	Mohlomong ke kamoo ba neng ba thabile hammoho kateng.
We really win.	Ruri rea hlola.
Life is hard.	Bophelo bo thata.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
I am no longer here.	Ha ke sa le teng.
You are tired of suffering.	U khathetse ke ho utloa bohloko.
It was very powerful.	E ne e le matla haholo.
Don't wonder anymore.	U se ke ua hlola u ipotsa.
He was a man now.	E ne e le monna jwale.
But sometimes they look very, very, very bad.	Empa ka linako tse ling li bonahala haholo, haholo, haholo.
Fear not to do.	Ho tšaba ho se etse.
I do not know.	Ha ke tsebe.
Thank you so much as well as my family.	Ke leboha haholo hammoho le lelapa la ka.
But it is better to know how to speak.	Empa ho molemo ho tseba ho bua.
He didn't do much.	O ne a sa etse hakaalo.
You can go now if you want.	U ka tsamaea hona joale haeba u batla.
I kept thinking about that night.	Ke ile ka lula ke nahana ka bosiu boo.
Very powerful, if any.	E matla haholo, haeba ho le joalo.
Please drive carefully.	Ka kopo, khanna ka hloko.
Anyone can be one.	Mang kapa mang e ka ba e mong.
But he was not calling.	Empa o ne a sa letsa.
This is a good question.	Ena ke potso e ntle.
He may know what it means.	A ka nna a tseba seo e neng e se bolela.
However, how much money he has.	Leha ho le joalo, o na le chelete e kae.
Ever since it did that.	Esale moo ho entseng seo.
More could be better.	Ho feta ho ka ba betere.
You would not even have to give them those things.	U ka be u sa tlameha le ho ba fa lintho tseo.
We hope you enjoy the article.	Re tšepa hore u rata ho boloka mona.
It also did nothing.	Le eona ha ea ka ea hlola e etsa letho.
It no longer exists.	Haho sa le teng.
See you.	Ke tla u bona.
You have to be emotional.	O tlameha ho ba le maikutlo.
And many of us do.	Mme ba bangata ba rona re etsa jwalo.
He decides to have dinner there.	O etsa qeto ea ho ja lijo tsa mantsiboea moo.
Thank you, man.	Kea leboha, monna.
They are still there for you.	Ba ntse ba le teng bakeng sa hao.
You may have a job somewhere.	E ka 'na eaba u na le mosebetsi sebakeng se seng.
He's trying, as he can now.	O ntse a leka, kamoo a ka khonang hona joale.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	U tlameha feela ho tseba ho e etsa hantle.
I will fix it while you write.	Ke tla e lokisa ha o ntse o ngola.
One woman arrives at the first.	Mosali e mong o fihla ho oa pele.
He did not seem to know how to play with the children.	O ne a bonahala a sa tsebe ho bapala le bana.
From where do we go ?.	Ho tloha moo re ea kae?.
I am very sorry about this situation.	Ke masoabi haholo ka boemo bona.
This was a difficult decision.	Ena e ne e le qeto e boima.
Good book, he said, but.	Buka e ntle, a re, empa.
They just have to know.	Ba tlameha ho tseba feela.
He did not intend to stay.	O ne a sa rera ho dula.
And she is beautiful.	Mme o motle.
He did not know where to go.	O ne a sa tsebe moo a lokelang ho ya teng.
We will definitely stay here again.	Ka sebele re tla lula mona hape.
Do not do this.	O seke wa etsa sena.
However, it is not visible.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e bonahale.
It is better to do the work.	Ho molemo ho etsa mosebetsi.
It must be very difficult to live here.	E tlameha ebe ho thata haholo ho phela mona.
My children love her very much.	Bana ba ka ba mo rata haholo.
Somehow all of this works well together.	Ka tsela e itseng sena sohle se sebetsa hantle hammoho.
Somehow he knew it was water.	Ka tsela e itseng a tseba hore ke metsi.
I can't sit still.	Ha ke khone ho lula.
Coffee is too strong for me.	Kofi e matla haholo bakeng sa ka.
It must be working.	E tlameha ebe e ntse e sebetsa.
That.	Seo.
His dinner looked delicious.	Lijo tsa hae tsa mantsiboea li ne li shebahala li le monate.
I want him to meet.	Ke batla hore a kopane.
He can't do this to her.	A ke ke a etsa sena ho eena.
She looked at him.	A mo sheba.
I do not believe it is the law.	Ha ke lumele hore ho joalo ke molao.
There was nothing that mattered.	Ho ne ho se letho leo e neng e le la bohlokoa.
However, it took time for them to do this.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ile ha nka nako hore ba etse sena.
It does not matter.	Ha ho na taba.
And my family.	Le lelapa la ka.
Look what they said.	Sheba seo ba neng ba se bua.
But there are still many questions.	Empa ho ntse ho na le lipotso tse ngata.
I had heard that before.	Ke ne ke utloile taba eo pele.
Do not doubt anymore.	U se ke ua hlola u belaela.
No more people.	Ha ho sa na batho.
I never thought about it or even thought of calling.	Ha kea ka ka nahana ka eona kapa hona ho nahana ho letsetsa.
And then it will just go on.	'Me joale e tla tsoela pele feela.
Over time it really means time.	Ha nako e ntse e tsamaea e hlile e bolela ka nako.
Good for everyone.	Molemo bakeng sa bohle.
She was not a pretty girl.	E ne e se ngoanana e motle.
He said he needed time to think.	O ile a re o hloka nako ea ho nahana.
This is what it comes to, he thought.	Sena ke seo e tlang ho sona, o ile a nahana.
It was never too much.	E ne e eso be ngata.
The children were nearby.	Bana ba ne ba le haufi.
We saw nothing.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bona letho.
That was just their fault.	Eo e ne e le phoso ea bona feela.
They have a delicious breakfast.	Ba na le lijo tsa hoseng tse monate.
This has been fun.	Sena se bile monate.
They were important, yet important.	E ne e le tsa bohlokoa, leha ho le joalo e le tsa bohlokoa.
You know nothing.	Ha u tsebe letho.
All the way.	Tsela eohle.
Speaking is an issue here.	Ho bua ke taba mona.
Although they may be human.	Leha ho ka etsahala hore ebe ke batho.
Something for everyone.	Ntho bakeng sa bohle.
I have the same situation.	Ke na le boemo bo tšoanang.
Hearing their feelings.	Ho utloa maikutlo a bona.
It was all powerful.	Tsohle e ne e le matla.
And if you do.	'Me haeba u etsa joalo.
I really want to play him again.	Ka sebele ke batla ho mo bapala hape.
I don't think about food.	Ha ke nahane ka lijo.
Love that boy.	Rata moshanyana eo.
It does not matter.	Ha ho na taba.
But it was not his final position.	Empa e ne e se boemo ba hae ba ho qetela.
I realize that now.	Ke hlokomela seo ha jwale.
Not so strong.	E seng matla hakaalo.
I hear it.	Kea e utloa.
The man must be her.	Monna o tlameha ho ba eena.
There are a few who would like both.	Ho na le ba 'maloa ba ka ratang ka bobeli.
Every decision we make is an opportunity.	Qeto e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo re e etsang ke monyetla.
I started working.	Ke ile ka qala ho sebetsa.
We were going to get home.	Re ne re ilo fihla hae.
Somehow, he did not think so.	Ka tsela e itseng, o ne a sa nahane joalo.
Or what he was doing.	Kapa seo a neng a se etsa.
I felt human again.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke le motho hape.
He can't read.	A ke ke a bala.
He did not know what to think.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a nahane eng.
Except for him.	Ntle le ho eena.
This opportunity exceeded my expectations.	Monyetla ona o ile oa feta seo ke neng ke se lebeletse.
However, he could not speak, he never did.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa khone ho bua, ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo.
He was a man.	E ne e le motho.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
Not many long-term things right now.	Ha se lintho tse ngata tsa nako e telele hona joale.
Most of us still don't know how to do it, though.	Ba bangata ba rona re ntse re sa tsebe ho e etsa, leha ho le joalo.
Once he decided on the room, he went into the room.	Hang ha a etsa qeto ka kamoreng, o ile a kena ka kamoreng.
You have not been on a real day.	Ha u e-so be ka letsatsi la sebele.
But that is definitely not the case.	Empa ka sebele ha ho joalo.
I feel tired.	Ke ikutloa ke khathetse.
However, that would have to stop.	Leha ho le joalo, seo se ne se tla tlameha ho ema.
Then we can try to find our way forward.	Ebe joale re ka leka ho fumana tsela ea rona ea ho ea pele.
I have trouble finding such a school.	Ke na le bothata ba ho fumana sekolo se joalo.
He would get a good day's work.	O ne a tla fumana mosebetsi o motle oa letsatsi.
We cannot be.	Re ke ke ra ba.
Don’t forget to give your opinion, too.	U se ke ua lebala ho fana ka maikutlo a hau, hape.
It's not him.	Ha se eena.
Sometimes people walk instead of driving.	Ka linako tse ling batho ba tsamaea ka maoto ho e-na le ho khanna.
You have to talk to him a lot.	U tlameha ho bua le eena haholo.
Here we were again, strangely as before.	Mona re ne re le teng hape, ka mokhoa o makatsang joaloka pele.
Also, one for each group.	Hape, e 'ngoe bakeng sa sehlopha ka seng.
You do not need a lot of money for all of that.	Ha o hloke chelete e ngata bakeng sa tseo kaofela.
They did not seem to be doing so.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
They did not have many material things.	Ba ne ba se na lintho tse ngata.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
However, no one ever noticed.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho motho ea kileng a hlokomela.
It was fun, but it was also hard.	Ho ne ho le monate, empa hape ho ne ho le thata.
We have to start now.	Re tlameha ho qala hona joale.
Very good, probably.	Ho molemo haholo, mohlomong.
You usually arrive late.	Hangata o fihla ka mor’a nako.
It might have been better for you.	E ka 'na eaba e ne e le molemo ho uena.
He was the only one who could not, because there was no one else.	Ke eena feela ea neng a sa khone, hobane ho ne ho se motho e mong.
But that is what it was not.	Empa ke sona seo e neng e se sona.
Many now.	Ba bangata hona joale.
It was very difficult for us.	E ne e le boima haholo bakeng sa rona.
Blurred vision.	Ho se bone hantle.
I was in school.	Ke ne ke le sekolong.
They know this is coming.	Ba tseba sena se tlang.
More than.	Ho feta.
So he would get his opinion on that.	Kahoo o ne a tla fumana maikutlo a hae ho seo.
I don't know what to do with it.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o tla etsa'ng ka eona.
Which is what happened.	E leng sona se etsahetseng.
They moved from place to place.	Ba ne ba tloha sebakeng se seng ho ya ho se seng.
Of course, he can still do it.	Ehlile, a ntse a ka e etsa.
Maybe that's what he needed.	Mohlomong ke sona seo a neng a se hloka.
We will take what we want as we please.	Re tla nka seo re se batlang kamoo re ratang kateng.
Just do it.	U e etse feela.
What time is it? 	Ke nako mang?
The truth is that it does not matter.	'Nete ke hore ha ho na taba.
asked the man.	ha botsa monna.
It can't move.	Ha e khone ho tsamaea.
They love to do it.	Ba rata ho e etsa.
I think it is here.	Ke nahana hore e teng mona.
I sat down.	Ke ile ka lula fatše.
Well, maybe happy.	Hantle, mohlomong thabile.
Yet it is here.	Leha ho le joalo e teng mona.
You need to keep it clear.	O lokela ho dula o hlakile.
I love everything.	Ke rata tsohle.
But he will soon speak.	Empa haufinyane o tla bua.
We agree to try it before you buy it.	Re lumela ho e leka pele u e reka.
You must forget it.	O tlameha ho e lebala.
It is not easy to find it.	Ha ho bonolo ho e fumana.
Work hard at school.	Sebetsa ka thata sekolong.
Everyone wants to work with like-minded people.	Motho e mong le e mong o batla ho sebetsa le batho ba nahanang joaloka bona.
Eventually you will get there.	Qetellong o tla fihla moo.
It basically means both.	Ha e le hantle e bolela bobeli.
Many will use it.	Ba bangata ba tla e sebelisa.
He did that well.	O ne a etsa tseo hantle.
Except there never was a day.	Ntle le ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba le letsatsi.
You have to leave before he gets here.	U lokela ho tsamaea pele a fihla mona.
I didn't have to come and get it.	Ke ne ke sa tlameha ho tla le ho o fumana.
The work became even more lonely.	Mosebetsi o ile oa e-ba bolutu le ho feta.
To me it seems too much.	Ho 'na e bonahala e le ngata haholo.
Something might happen to him so you have to find him quickly.	Ho ka 'na ha etsahala ntho e itseng ho eena kahoo u tlameha ho mo fumana kapele.
Repair your car.	Lokisa koloi ea hau.
What would you like to drink?	O tla thabela ho noa eng?
He was at home.	O ne a le hae.
You have to agree to help.	O lokela ho lumela ho thusa.
We were playing and playing and playing.	Re ne re bapala le ho bapala le ho bapala.
Or we can do it together.	Kapa re ka e etsa hammoho.
I want more.	Ke batla haholo.
I could not understand it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e utloisisa.
How he could understand and speak well.	Kamoo a neng a khona ho utloisisa le ho bua hantle.
Strange thing.	Ntho e makatsang.
How will you come?	U tla tla joang?
And you know he has no problem.	'Me ua tseba hore ha a na bothata.
If not, well enough.	Haeba ha ho joalo, hantle ka ho lekana.
It did not sleep well.	Ha e a robala hantle.
He took the place.	O ile a nka sebaka.
The problem was that it was hard to find.	Bothata e ne e le hore ho ne ho le thata ho fumana.
They are several things at once, but none of them.	Ke lintho tse 'maloa ka nako e le' ngoe, empa ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
Instead of opening the door, he simply walked through it.	Ho e-na le ho bula lemati, o ile a feta feela ka lona.
I'm new to this and I really need help with this.	Ke ncha ho sena 'me ke hlile ke hloka thuso ka sena.
I thought about it alone.	Ke ile ka e nahana ke le mong.
No one would have to know.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tla tlameha ho tseba.
But we both love it.	Empa ka bobeli rea e rata.
No one will ever know.	Ha ho motho ya tla e tseba.
Out of nothing comes out of something.	Ho tsoa ho letho ho tsoa ho hong.
However, there seemed to be no way out.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho bonahala ho se na tsela.
Three were empty.	Tse tharo li ne li se na letho.
I tried to memorize it.	Ke ile ka leka ho e boloka ka hlooho.
Some are yet to come.	Tse ling li sa tla.
He did that.	O entse seo.
I wanted to know everything.	Ke ne ke batla ho tseba tsohle.
They have never been like that.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha ba joalo.
Not sure where to go from here.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na u ka ea kae ho tloha mona.
However, being difficult would not mean being easy.	Leha ho le joalo, ho thata ho ne ho ke ke ha bolela ho ba bonolo.
We see this.	Sena re se bona.
He was with her when it happened.	O ne a e-na le eena ha e etsahala.
I don't care what people think of me.	Ha ke tsotelle hore na batho ba nahana eng ka nna.
But then that was nothing new.	Empa joale seo e ne e se ntho e ncha.
We're all here now.	Kaofela re mona joale.
We should do all we can about them.	Re lokela ho etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang ka bona.
That was my job.	Oo e ne e le mosebetsi oa ka.
One line.	Mohala o le mong.
I had a job to do.	Ke ne ke na le mosebetsi oo ke lokelang ho o etsa.
I will really help you.	Ruri ke tla o thusa.
Everyone knows you.	Bohle ba o tseba.
I wonder if this is good.	Kea ipotsa hore na sena se setle.
You can stay longer than your time.	U ka lula nako e telele ho feta nako ea hau.
This was not the case.	Sena se ne se se joalo.
Try to earn money for it.	Leka ho fumana chelete bakeng sa eona.
Some may not.	E ka 'na eaba ba bang ha ba joalo.
So he stayed.	Kahoo a lula.
It's my family.	Ke lelapa la ka.
We have to say we would not have asked for anything better.	Re tlameha ho bolela hore re ka be re sa kopa letho le betere.
It has never been enough.	Ha ho mohla ho kileng ha lekana.
Everything is new.	Tsohle li ncha.
Some will believe, some will refuse.	Ba bang ba tla lumela, ba bang ba hana.
You go on to it.	U tsoela pele ho eona.
I'm just as good as you.	Ke hantle joalo ka uena.
I was looking for an easy way out.	Ke ne ke batla tsela e bonolo ea ho tsoa.
Maybe some of the party would be at his house.	Mohlomong ba bang ba moketeng ba ka ba teng ha hae.
We think they are very good.	Re nahana hore li ntle haholo.
You see them very much.	U ba bona haholo.
And she was beautiful.	Mme o ne a le motle.
But that did not work.	Empa seo ha sea ka sa sebetsa.
With that, going forward.	Ka seo, ho ea pele.
I'll see you tomorrow at school.	Ke tla u bona hosane sekolong.
They will come home.	Ba tla fihla hae.
I have not seen him in years.	E se e le lilemo ke sa mo bone.
I only found out when the police told me.	Ke fumane feela ha mapolesa a mpolella.
Thinking alone.	Ho nahana a le mong.
Now he wanted to return home.	Joale o ne a batla ho khutlela hae.
He still wanted to fix it.	O ne a ntse a batla ho e lokisa.
He didn't know why that, either.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na hobaneng hoo, le hona.
You have to hear it for real.	U tlameha ho e utloa ka 'nete.
I just had to say it.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho e bua feela.
You will not find a better product.	U ke ke ua fumana tlhahiso e betere.
But he was too tired to think straight.	Empa o ne a khathetse haholo hore a ka nahana hantle.
They started early.	Ba ile ba qala pele ho nako.
I should not say.	Ha kea lokela ho re.
Or where he should have been.	Kapa moo a neng a lokela ho ba teng.
He felt heavy enough.	O ile a ikutloa a le boima ho lekana.
He looks like this is where he is.	O shebahala eka ke hona moo a leng teng.
This year we have not fully understood it.	Selemong sena ha re e-so e utloisise hantle.
Lots of things happened.	Lintho tse ngata tse etsahetseng.
I'll try it sometime.	Ke tla e leka ka nako e 'ngoe.
And it's fun.	Mme ho monate.
He's just here, in this room.	O mona feela, ka phaposing ena.
Eventually, though, she felt better.	Leha ho le joalo, qetellong o ile a ikutloa a le betere.
We will find out who did this.	Re tla fumana hore na ke mang ea entseng sena.
I told them that.	Ke ba boleletse seo.
Read the book again.	Bala buka eo hape.
He doesn't talk much but it will come.	Ha a bue haholo empa ho tla tla.
Instead of one for everyone.	Ho e-na le e le 'ngoe bakeng sa e mong le e mong.
Now she has a baby.	Hona joale o na le ngoana.
That is what the morning will be like.	Ke seo hoseng ho tla ba sona.
Because he is not the only one.	Hobane ha se eena feela.
So as a professional, he knew his stuff.	Kahoo joaloka setsebi, o ne a tseba lintho tsa hae.
That's my problem.	Ke bothata ba ka.
Amazing work.	Mosebetsi o makatsang.
They were there now.	Ba ne ba le teng jwale.
I was not expecting anything.	Ke ne ke sa lebella letho.
The phone was ringing.	Mohala o ne o ntse o lla.
See if you can do what it wants.	Bona hore na u ka etsa seo e se batlang.
Mine has been better.	Ea ka e bile betere.
So we move on.	Kahoo re tsoela pele.
There is such a system.	Ho na le mokhoa o joalo.
This too seemed a bit unrealistic.	Sena le sona se ne se bonahala e le sa sebele.
We will stay here again if necessary.	Re tla lula mona hape haeba ho hlokahala.
We both really liked it.	Ka bobeli re ile ra e rata haholo.
I was just starting to think.	Ke ne ke qala ho nahana.
He went swimming every day.	O ne a ya sesa letsatsi le letsatsi.
I have it now.	Ke na le eona hona joale.
We learn from others.	Re ithuta ho ba bang.
That should take enough time.	Seo se lokela ho nka nako e lekaneng.
So.	Ngaka.
That's not what he is.	Ha se seo a leng sona.
Finally, we read.	Qetellong, re bala .
He looked bad.	O ne a shebahala a le mpe.
He studied hard at school.	O ile a ithuta ka thata sekolong.
He will come looking for you.	O tla tla ho o batla.
And it was just fast.	Mme e ne e le kapele feela.
Traveling was easy, but it was useless.	Ho tsamaea ho ne ho le bonolo, empa ho ne ho se na thuso.
Or to one of them.	Kapa ho e mong oa bona.
Our job is to provide it.	Mosebetsi oa rona ke ho fana ka eona.
The more you read, the more it will fit.	Ha o bala haholo, ke moo ho tlang ho kena.
I think he will love her very much.	Ke nahana hore o tla mo rata haholo.
Make sure you do not eat too much.	Etsa bonnete ba hore ha u je haholo.
Maybe it was bad news.	Mohlomong e ne e le litaba tse mpe.
However, things did not turn out that way.	Leha ho le joalo, lintho li ne li se ka tsela eo li neng li le ka eona pele.
But he has his problems.	Empa o na le mathata a hae.
I will be.	Ke tla ba.
It mentioned three things.	E ile ea bolela lintho tse tharo.
There was nothing else he had to do.	Ho ne ho se letho le leng leo a lokelang ho le etsa.
I need to understand something else.	Ke hloka ho utloisisa ntho e 'ngoe hape.
He just called you last night.	O qeta ho o letsetsa bosiung bo fetileng.
Hard work.	Mosebetsi o boima.
We need to do something.	Re hloka ho etsa ho hong.
He really likes to be with people and he is good with children.	O hlile o rata ho ba le batho mme o hantle le bana.
You will know it.	O tla e tseba.
I've never seen this before.	Ha ke eso bone sena pele.
I was just beginning to see it.	Ke ne ke qala ho e bona.
That should mean everything.	Seo se lokela ho bolela tsohle.
Get out with it.	Tsoa le eona.
Use them.	Sebelisa tsona.
His car was still there.	Koloi ea hae e ne e ntse e le teng.
It spoke to me.	E ile ya bua le nna.
I could not do the work.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho etsa mosebetsi.
However, it was strange.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le ntho e makatsang.
All things that are not true.	Lintho tsohle tseo e seng 'nete.
I don't care what happened or what you do.	Ha ke tsotelle se etsahetseng kapa seo o se etsang.
He was very sad to hear that.	O ile a utloa bohloko haholo ha a utloa litaba tseo.
He lives alone.	O lula a le mong.
For working hard while doing so.	Bakeng sa ho sebetsa ka thata ha a ntse a etsa joalo.
You were looking for it, you found it.	U ne u e batla, u e fumane.
We do things.	Re etsa lintho.
It was not a mistake.	E ne e se phoso.
He knew nothing about this.	O ne a sa tsebe letho ka sena.
I really needed it.	Ke ne ke e hloka haholo.
He is with me.	O na le nna.
I can find out about Dad tonight.	Nka fumana ka Ntate bosiung bona.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
Also, more books will be released soon.	Hape, libuka tse ngata li tla tsoa haufinyane.
We, instead, took the opportunity to have a party.	Re, ho e-na le hoo, re ile ra nka monyetla oa ho ba le mokete.
I know it was his.	Kea tseba hore e ne e le oa hae.
This is backwards.	Sena ke morao.
Of course you will read very well.	Ehlile o tla bala hantle haholo.
It will do its best.	E tla etsa sohle seo e ka se khonang.
Anyone can see.	Mang kapa mang a ka bona.
He should know that he feels the same way.	O lokela ho tseba hore na le eena o ikutloa ka tsela e tšoanang.
loving people.	batho ba ratang.
And it was even better this time.	Mme ho ne ho le betere le ho feta nakong ena.
I know it was good.	Kea tseba hore ho ne ho le molemo.
It will not work.	E ke ke ea sebetsa.
This does not seem to be the case	Sena ha se bonahale e le 'nete
It's difficult.	Ho thata.
Here is a picture of my house.	Mona ke setšoantšo sa ntlo ea ka.
That would not happen, of course.	Seo se ne se ke ke sa etsahala, ehlile.
He had done it again.	O ne a e entse hape.
We know it makes money.	Rea tseba hore e etsa chelete.
In fact, the problem is already there.	Ha e le hantle, bothata boo bo se bo ntse bo le teng.
All this time.	Nako ena kaofela.
Even if you think so, it probably isn't.	Leha u nahana hore ho joalo, mohlomong ha ho joalo.
Not at all.	Ho hang.
I want him to be tough.	Ke batla hore a be thata.
It is an everyday thing.	Ke ntho ea letsatsi le letsatsi.
You will feel better.	U tla ikutloa betere.
And then, in the end, he refused to try.	'Me joale, qetellong, a hana ho leka.
But yes, this is a real place.	Empa ee, sena ke sebaka sa 'nete.
So they can trust.	Kahoo ba ka tšepa.
I can do anything to you.	Nka etsa eng kapa eng ho uena.
It did not happen to him.	Ha hoa ka ha etsahala ho eena.
This is a very strange situation for me sometimes.	Ena ke boemo bo makatsang haholo ho nna ka linako tse ling.
However, people do not do that.	Leha ho le joalo, batho ha ba etse joalo.
He still did not think so.	O ne a ntse a sa nahane joalo.
Always skip meal times.	Kamehla tlohela nako ea lijo.
But there is no way out.	Empa ha ho na tsela ea ho tsoa.
Maybe one day it will continue.	Mohlomong ka letsatsi le leng e tla tsoela pele.
It will help him get home.	Ho tla mo thusa ho fihla hae.
He soon realized that the man was just looking for money.	Kapele o ile a bona hore monna eo o mpa a batla chelete feela.
Many understand.	Ba bangata baa utloisisa.
She is a beautiful woman.	Ke mosali ea motle.
Moreover, it is fun.	Ho feta moo, ho monate.
That is an adequate request.	Eo ke kopo e lekaneng.
This should never happen.	Sena ha sea lokela ho etsahala le ka mohla.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke tsebe hantle.
He stood with another woman.	O ile a ema le mosali e mong.
Someone is coming.	E mong oa tla.
I hope they will continue to do so.	Ke tšepa hore ba tla tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
He needed something to work on.	O ne a hloka ho hong ho sebetsa.
I can't find it.	Ha ke khone ho e fumana.
Everyone else did the same.	Ba bang kaofela ba ile ba etsa joalo.
We see that as a learning process.	Re nka seo e le mokhoa oa ho ithuta.
We will not list them here.	Ha re na ho li ngola mona.
I was looking for them at home.	Ke ne ke ba batla hae.
Very well, to me in any way.	Hantle haholo, ho nna ka tsela efe kapa efe.
I wish to see you once, my friends.	Ke lakatsa ho le bona hang, metsoalle ea ka.
So will you help us?	Joale na u tla re thusa?
It is often difficult to hear.	Hangata ho thata ho utloa.
But no one was going to do it.	Empa ho ne ho se motho ea tla e etsa.
That was not his first picture.	Eo e ne e se setšoantšo sa hae sa pele.
I really enjoyed it, and I did.	Ke hlile ke mo thabetse, 'me ke mo thabetse.
I'm not in a good place.	Ha ke sebakeng se setle.
There is our father.	Ntate oa rona ke eo.
It was just that.	Ho ne ho le joalo feela.
She loves it.	O a e rata.
When it returned it was empty.	Ha e khutla e ne e se na letho.
Write everything down.	Ngola tsohle.
Because then people will go looking.	Hobane joale batho ba tla ea batla.
Maybe this is a group thing.	Mohlomong ena ke ntho ea sehlopha.
I would have to drive.	Ke ne ke tla tlameha ho khanna.
But be careful.	Empa hlokomela.
No image required.	Ha ho hlokahale setšoantšo.
Nothing bad will happen.	Haho ntho e mpe e tlang ho etsahala.
And it works for survival.	Mme e sebetsa bakeng sa ho phela.
Wanting, maybe.	Ho batla, mohlomong.
He does not speak.	Ha a bue.
My father will love that.	Ntate o tla rata seo.
There was a problem with me.	Ho ne ho ena le bothata ka nna.
It exists without money.	E teng ka ntle ho chelete.
And other things, what he wanted to tell me.	Le lintho tse ling, seo a neng a batla ho mpolella sona.
That's the way it should be.	Ke kamoo e lokelang ho ba kateng.
He can't stay.	A ke ke a dula.
He would not have wanted that.	A ka be a sa ka a batla seo.
His son certainly did the same.	Mora oa hae ka sebele o entse ntho e tšoanang.
Time was of the essence.	Nako e ne e se letho.
Enter the bedroom.	Kena ka phaposing ea ho robala.
I am also a teacher.	Hape ke tichere.
Talk to me.	Bua le nna.
He really didn't care about anyone or anything.	O ne a hlile a sa tsotelle mang kapa mang kapa letho.
That book is not mine.	Buka eo hase ea ka.
Whatever you asked him to do, he would do for you.	Ntho efe kapa efe eo u neng u mo kōpa hore a e etse, o ne a tla u etsetsa eona.
But the mind continues to work in me, instead.	Empa kelello e tsoela pele ho sebetsa ho 'na, ho e-na le hoo.
I am wearing.	Kea apara.
Many people are afraid to talk.	Batho ba bangata ba tšaba ho bua.
Probably not what most people would expect.	Mohlomong ha se seo batho ba bangata ba neng ba ka se lebella.
That makes it easier.	Seo se etsa hore ho be bonolo.
Maybe that's all you need to know.	Mohlomong ke eona feela ntho eo u hlokang ho e tseba.
I doubt there are as many children as you, though.	Ke belaela hore na ho na le bana ba bangata joalo ka uena, leha ho le joalo.
Parents and children read together.	Batsoali le bana ba bala hammoho.
It makes them important.	E ba etsa ba bohlokoa.
I will ask my question anyway.	Ke tla botsa potso ea ka leha ho le joalo.
This happened from time to time.	Sena se ne se etsahala nako le nako.
Think that the child is me.	Nahana hore ngoana eo ke 'na.
You believe they are, of course.	Ua lumela hore ba joalo, ehlile.
Now the people were many.	Joale batho ba ne ba se ba le bangata haholo.
Trust your son.	Tšepa mora oa hao.
He was a good, strong man.	E ne e le monna e motle, ya matla.
Yes, just maybe.	E, mohlomong feela.
I thought maybe he was making it fun.	Ke ne ke nahana hore mohlomong o e etsetsa monate.
Yet he knew there was nothing he could do.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a tseba hore ho ne ho se letho leo a ka le etsang.
He can only do one job at a time.	A ka etsa mosebetsi o le mong feela ka nako.
It's a simple situation.	Ke boemo bo bonolo.
He is your only son.	Ke mora wa hao a le mong.
I really enjoy it.	Ke e thabela haholo.
He knows us.	O a re tseba.
We are here to do the work.	Re mona ho etsa mosebetsi.
He may be busy.	E ka 'na eaba o phathahane.
They start this week.	Ba qala bekeng ena.
That was the first time we visited.	Leo e ne e le lekhetlo la pele re ka etela.
As long as you could pay, of course.	Ha feela o ne o ka lefa, ehlile.
We did not write comments.	Ha rea ​​ngola maikutlo.
I would do that, too.	Ke ne ke tla etsa joalo, hape.
Many people feel guilty about it.	Batho ba bangata ba ikutloa ba le molato ka hona.
You are my father.	U ntate oa ka.
Try to wear the same clothes as everyone else.	Leka ho apara liaparo tse tšoanang le tsa ba bang.
The fourth time he was at home.	Lekhetlo la bone o ne a le hae.
I knew what other people thought of them.	Ke ne ke tseba seo batho ba bang ba se nahanang ka bona.
This took several hours.	Sena se ile sa nka lihora tse 'maloa.
But the ceremony can take place prematurely.	Empa mokete o ka etsahala pele ho nako.
This would be easy.	Sena se ne se tla ba bonolo.
He says it's easy to do.	O re ho bonolo ho e etsa.
However, that was not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se joalo.
That’s all you would want him to be.	Ke sohle seo u ka ratang hore a be sona.
There is no way beyond that.	Haho tsela ya ho feta moo.
It has never been an issue for us.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea e-ba taba ho rōna.
He doesn't like this thing.	Ha a rate ntho ena.
He sat down again.	A dula hape.
It felt it time to do it.	E ile ea utloa ke nako ea ho e etsa.
He did not understand what was going on.	O ne a sa utloisise se etsahalang.
I thought nothing of it.	Ha kea ka ka nahana letho ka eona.
He has had many happy years here.	O bile le lilemo tse ngata tse monate mona.
Take another coffee.	Nka kofi e 'ngoe hape.
And this is easy to understand.	'Me sena se bonolo ho se utloisisa.
Think about this.	Nahana ka sena.
The way everyone did it.	Tsela eo bohle ba entseng ka eona.
Although not exactly.	Leha e se hantle.
No one knows who made it or why.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na ke mang ea e entseng kapa hore na ke hobane'ng.
It happens, and it happens often.	Hoa etsahala, mme ho etsahala hangata.
It just says thank you for the comment.	E mpa feela e re kea leboha ka maikutlo.
You can do anything.	O ka etsa eng kapa eng.
I will need more.	Ke tla hloka haholo.
And if you are, let me tell you again.	Mme ha o le teng, e re ke o bolelle hape.
We love a lot.	Re rata ntho e ngata.
We will need more than anything.	Re tla hloka ho feta ho tsohle.
And we find it at home.	Mme re e fumana hae.
So make sure you do it right.	Kahoo etsa bonnete ba hore u e etsa hantle.
They just seem to be that way.	Li bonahala li le joalo feela.
You can't make us do anything.	U ke ke ua etsa hore re etse letho.
He wanted to do whatever he wanted to do, but he too.	O ne a batla ho etsa ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe eo a neng a batla ho e etsa, empa le eena.
If so we have had it.	Haeba ho joalo re bile le eona.
That night we had a big party.	Bosiung boo re ile ra ba le mokete o moholo.
So now I can be in that place.	Kahoo joale nka ba sebakeng seo.
It was a dog.	E ne e le ntja.
Surprisingly.	Ka mokhoa o makatsang.
Playing with him is so much fun.	Ho bapala le eena ho monate haholo.
But do not ask, do not say.	Empa u se ke ua botsa, u se ke ua bolela.
There may be something.	Ho ka ba le ho hong.
Everything goes the way it should.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e tsamaea ka tsela eo e lokelang ho sebetsa ka eona.
Everyone had to get his own life.	E mong le e mong o ne a lokela ho fumana bophelo ba hae.
It was not heavy.	Ho ne ho se boima.
But everyone must live their lives.	Empa e mong le e mong o tlameha ho phela bophelo ba hae.
He couldn't find her here.	O ne a ke ke a mo fumana mona.
Please note that.	Ka kopo hlokomela seo.
She decided to buy it.	E ile ea etsa qeto ea ho e reka.
Maybe you should go now.	Mohlomong u lokela ho tsamaea hona joale.
It's too old to know.	Ke khale haholo ho tseba.
It has a.	E na le a.
The phone rang while we were eating.	Mohala o ile oa lla ha re ntse re ja.
In my opinion it is much better.	Ka maikutlo a ka ho molemo haholo.
The water is very hard.	Metsi a thata haholo.
Me, me, me.	Nna, nna, nna.
No one believed him.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mo lumela.
I would say no.	Ke ne ke tla re che.
But almost everyone is sure.	Empa hoo e batlang e le motho e mong le e mong o na le bonnete.
Or more.	Kapa ho feta moo.
Eventually, the police arrested him.	Qetellong, mapolesa a ile a mo tšoara.
He traveled a lot and often came home late.	O ne a tsamaea haholo ’me hangata o ne a fihla hae ka mor’a nako.
It could be more.	E ka ba ho feta.
I went to his room.	Ke ile ka ea kamoreng ea hae.
A really great man.	Monna e moholo ruri.
If he had not done so.	Hoja a sa ka a etsa jwalo.
So live, dress !.	Kahoo phela, apara!.
And the hands of a dangerous man.	Le matsoho a monna ea kotsi.
They are a good team.	Ke sehlopha se setle.
It has made it easy to imagine.	E entse hore ho be bonolo ho nahana.
Go ahead boy.	Tsoela pele moshanyana.
He did not want to do things that he knew would help him.	O ne a sa batle ho etsa lintho tseo a tsebang hore li tla mo thusa.
But what we knew.	Empa seo re neng re se tseba .
So they can learn.	Kahoo ba ka ithuta.
I did things.	Ke entse lintho.
I could have another time in life.	Nka ba le nako e 'ngoe ea bophelo.
He had many of them.	O ne a ena le tse ngata tsa tsona.
He knew they had only one chance.	O ne a tseba hore ba na le monyetla o le mong feela.
Yours does the same.	Le ya hao e etsa jwalo.
First, he had an issue to be settled.	Pele, o ne a e-na le taba eo a lokelang ho e lokisa.
Children who are already at risk are still suffering.	Bana ba seng ba ntse ba le kotsing ba ntse ba utloa bohloko.
He does not want us to be alone.	Ha a batle hore re be bang.
Yes, we can.	E, re ka khona.
Is it possible?	Na e ka etsahala?
But we are human.	Empa re batho.
That's all.	Ke tseo kaofela.
But I doubt I can do this.	Empa ke belaela hore nka etsa sena.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	U hloka feela ho boloka nako ea hau.
Why, of course, he could stand and walk.	Hobaneng, ehlile, o ne a ka ema a tsamaea.
He spoke a little.	A bua hanyane.
One can find anything there.	Motho a ka fumana eng kapa eng moo.
I didn't care.	Ke ne ke sa tsotelle letho.
There is a way.	Tsela e teng.
You don't have to say anything.	Ha o a tlameha ho bua letho.
I don't know him very well.	Ha ke mo tsebe hakaalo.
He did not pay it.	Ha a ka a e lefa letho.
I just like to read your thoughts.	Ke rata feela ho bala maikutlo a hau.
If you already have it, it is good for you.	Haeba u se u ntse u e-na le eona, e molemo ho uena.
What were we talking about?	Re ne re bua ka eng?
Do you want a girl or a boy?	O batla ngoanana kapa moshanyana?
And that worked just fine.	Mme seo se ile sa sebetsa hantle feela.
What about you?	Ke eng ho uena?
There can be only one chance.	Ho ka ba le monyetla o le mong feela.
They had to help.	Ba ne ba lokela ho thusa.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
It is to keep them.	Ke ho ba boloka.
Obviously he would have more than that.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a tla ba le tse ngata ho feta tseo.
Some are not.	Ba bang ha ba eo.
However, this task is difficult.	Leha ho le joalo, mosebetsi ona o boima.
Work was completed in a day's work.	Mosebetsi o ile a qeta ho lokisa ka letsatsi.
Everyone sings it.	Bohle ba e bina.
Look here.	Sheba mona.
But if he is, he will probably know.	Empa haeba a le teng, mohlomong o tla tseba.
Good for him.	Molemo ho eena.
I am sure of it.	Ke na le bonnete ba eona.
We need to know what that looks like.	Re hloka ho tseba hore na seo se shebahala joang.
And he did not.	Mme hakana.
I think it's really fun.	Ke nahana hore e hlile e monate.
He was looking for a job.	O ne a batla mosebetsi o itseng.
They would go with you.	Ba ne ba tla tsamaea le uena.
They really do not want to leave.	Ruri ha ba batle ho tsamaea.
I will be doing well today.	Ke tla be ke sebetsa hantle kajeno.
I have to have clothes.	Ke tlameha ho ba le liaparo.
The children loved it.	Bana ba ne ba e rata.
It's that simple.	E bonolo joalo.
News time.	Nako ea litaba.
That's the way it is.	Ke mokhoa.
We hope we will understand everything soon.	Re tšepa hore re tla utloisisa tsohle haufinyane.
However, it does not take anything.	Leha ho le joalo, ha e nke letho.
He really did it, so he did it.	O hlile o e entse, ka hona o e entse.
As a result.	Ka hoo.
He ate his breakfast.	O ile a ja lijo tsa hae tsa hoseng.
He had work to do.	O ne a na le mosebetsi oo a lokelang ho o etsa.
And maybe it's a good thing he doesn't do it.	'Me mohlomong ke ntho e ntle ha a sa e etse.
As it should be.	Kamoo e lokelang ho ba kateng.
In fact, amazing.	Ka 'nete, e makatsang.
I know you want more.	Kea tseba hore u batla tse ling.
You can read it, and we will talk about it.	U ka e bala, ebe re bua ka eona.
Not at all.	Ho hang ha ho joalo.
But he did not give her time.	Empa ha aa ka a mo fa nako.
Never forget that as you read.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua lebala seo ha u ntse u mo bala.
He ate quickly and left.	A ja kapele mme a tloha.
The woman is weeping.	Mosali eo o ne a se a lla.
This was to be his.	Sena se ne se lokela ho ba sa hae.
But that is true of most children.	Empa ho joalo le ka bana ba bangata.
Day, without problems.	Letsatsi, ntle le mathata.
I worked hard for my money.	Ke ne ke sebetsa ka thata bakeng sa chelete ea ka.
We love everyone.	Re rata bohle.
I knew that.	Ke ne ke tseba taba eo.
It's not just school.	Ha se sekolo feela.
Most people did not.	Batho ba bangata ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
He was not there for them.	O ne a le sieo bakeng sa bona.
They go to work every day, not really knowing why.	Ba ea mosebetsing letsatsi le leng le le leng, ba sa tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
We have to work hard now.	Re tlameha ho sebetsa ka thata hona joale.
He can't take it because he doesn't have to.	A ke ke a e nka hobane a sa tlameha.
I think they want to do something.	Ke nahana hore ba batla ho etsa ho hong.
Certainly every day.	Ka sebele letsatsi le letsatsi.
So, of course, it can no longer exist.	Ka hona, ehlile, e ke ke ea hlola e e-ba teng.
He did not understand why.	O ne a sa utloisise lebaka.
And it obviously worked.	'Me ho hlakile hore e ile ea sebetsa.
But it took too long.	Empa ho ne ho nka nako e telele haholo.
Everyone was down to start.	E mong le e mong o ne a le fatše ho qala.
It will be here then, like us, waiting for you.	E tla ba mona ka nako eo, joalo ka rona, re u emetse.
For decades, he was strong and resilient.	Ka lilemo tse mashome, o ile a ba matla le ho ba matla.
Road.	Tsela.
Because he does not see anything that he should be afraid of.	Hobane ha a bone letho leo a lokelang ho le tšaba.
Today you have seen them.	Kajeno o ba bone.
I have a feeling for it.	Ke na le maikutlo ka eona.
He read it, alone.	A e bala, a le mong.
People are starting to come home to hear it.	Batho ba qala ho khutlela hae ho e utloa.
So, it is you.	Kahoo, ke uena.
No one will ever find them.	Ha ho motho ea tla ke a li fumane.
You know, it just doesn't connect.	Ua tseba, ha e kopane feela.
I should not have come here.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho tla mona.
No, it did not give much.	Che, ha ea ka ea fana haholo.
I can tell you too.	Le nna nka o bolella.
Ever since I was a child the problem.	Haesale ke le ngoana bothata.
I would not do it right.	Ke ne nke ke ka e etsa hantle.
That did not matter.	Seo e ne e se taba.
I will not open them.	Ha ke na ho li bula.
He doesn't care about anyone.	Ha a tsotelle motho.
Clearly, his name already exists.	Ho hlakile hore lebitso la hae le se le le teng.
No one seems to think good of all.	Ho bonahala eka ha ho motho ea nahanang molemo oa bohle.
We will do better.	Re tla etsa betere.
It's too close, too close.	E haufi haholo, e haufi haholo.
And I'm not sure how I can fix it.	'Me ha ke na bonnete ba hore na nka e lokisa joang.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho tla etsahala joalo.
I am alive now.	Kea phela hona joale.
It does not exist	Ha e eo
Hours can take a long time.	Lihora li ka nka nako e telele.
I really had this time this year.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sena nako selemong sena.
It’s more than what we were talking about.	Ke ho feta seo re neng re bua le sona.
And nobody did that.	Mme ha ho motho ya ileng a etsa jwalo.
I have never seen anything before.	Ha ke so bone letho pele.
That represents problems.	Seo se emetse mathata.
What they would like to do is return home.	Seo ba ka ratang ho se etsa ke ho khutlela hae.
I don't need to see it again.	Ha ke hloke ho e bona hape.
You can say more.	O ka bua ho feta.
, caring for his family.	, ho hlokomela lelapa la hae.
We watch the news every day.	Re shebella litaba letsatsi le leng le le leng.
I never saw the children again.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke bona bana hape.
I knew how to get there now.	Ke ne ke tseba ho fihla moo joale.
A father with a father.	Ntate ea nang le ntate.
Look, it's just a matter of time.	Sheba, ke taba ya nako feela.
Lots of time.	Nako e ngata.
It would not be so bad.	E ne e ka se be mpe hakaalo.
He did not say much.	Ha aa ka a bua haholo.
The best we can do.	Se molemo ka ho fetisisa seo re ka se khonang.
They left very quickly.	Ba ile ba tsamaea kapele haholo.
In the meantime, he is planning.	Ho sa le joalo, o ntse a rera.
I could hear others behind me.	Ke ne ke utloa ba bang ka mor'a ka.
There will be only this.	Ho tla ba le sena feela.
But it was the best thing we could do.	Empa e ne e le ntho e molemo ka ho fetisisa eo re ka e etsang.
He went right to work.	O ile hantle mosebetsing.
And this is not necessarily a bad thing.	'Me sena hase hakaalo ntho e mpe.
However that was needed.	Leha ho le joalo seo se ne se hlokahala.
I look forward to it more than anyone on the team.	Ke e lebeletse ho feta mang kapa mang sehlopheng.
You were not the only one last night.	U ne u se uena bosiung bo fetileng.
Do not drink.	U se ke ua noa.
Here is a picture of the old road.	Mona ke setšoantšo sa tsela ea khale.
That was really fun.	Seo se ne se le monate haholo.
It is very important to go back.	Ho bohlokoa haholo ho khutlela morao.
It is a real work.	Ke mosebetsi oa sebele.
Which is still there today.	E leng teng le kajeno.
That seemed impossible.	Seo se ne se bonahala se ka etsahala.
However, it still is.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ntse ho le joalo.
But that doesn't really make it just a joke.	Empa hoo ha ho hlile ha ho etse hore e be ntho ea ho bapala feela.
Of course, no one was with him at the time.	Ha e le hantle, ho ne ho se motho ea nang le eena ka nako eo.
Or if someone is there.	Kapa haeba ho na le motho moo.
We heard this morning.	Re utloile hoseng hona.
Surprisingly, I really like it.	Ho makatsang ke hore ke e rata haholo.
We have been talking about this for years.	Re qetile lilemo re bua ka taba ena.
But he did.	Empa o ile a etsa joalo.
I will never pass that place again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke feta sebakeng seo hape.
It would be better to forget him.	Ho ka ba molemo ho mo lebala.
I will never ask them again.	Nke ke ka hlola ke botsa ho bona.
There is no more housewife for me.	Ha ho sa na mosali oa ntlo bakeng sa ka.
They use it, and then they move on.	Ba e sebelisa, ebe ba tsoela pele.
But don't trust me to stay.	Empa u se ke ua tšepa hore ke tla lula.
Work hard and you will get a job.	Sebetsa ka thata mme o tla fumana mosebetsi.
You and I, meet in that place.	Nna le wena, re kopana sebakeng seo.
We need you now more than ever.	Re u hloka hona joale ho feta neng kapa neng.
A tough old guy.	Mohlankana ea thata oa khale.
Sometimes you have to look for money, man.	Ka nako e 'ngoe u tlameha ho batla chelete, monna.
Everyone should look at this.	E mong le e mong o lokela ho sheba sena.
Yet there is nothing he can do.	Leha ho le joalo ha ho letho leo a ka le etsang.
That would only mean you are visiting here, too.	Hoo ho ka bolela feela hore o etela mona, hape.
It has become our favorite festival.	E se e le mokete oo re o ratang haholo.
We have never had anything like this happen here.	Ha ho mohla re kileng ra ba le ntho e kang ena e etsahalang mona.
However, there is good news.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le litaba tse monate.
That's exactly how you do it.	Ke hantle hore na u etsa joang.
We hear you.	Rea u utloa.
So the man got dressed quickly and returned home.	Kahoo monna a apara kapele mme a khutlela hae.
We did a great job of catching them.	Re entse mosebetsi o motle oa ho li tšoara.
So, what should you do? 	Joale, u ne u lokela ho etsa'ng?
he thought.	a nahana.
But the picture of the whole place is not like that.	Empa setšoantšo sa sebaka sohle ha se joalo.
It's a very sad thing here.	Ke ntho e bohloko haholo mona.
I'm just trying to keep going.	Ke leka feela ho tsoela pele.
There was no way out.	Ho ne ho se na tsela ea ho tsoa.
Keep it up!.	Pele ea pele!.
This is the kind of food.	Ena ke mofuta oa lijo.
He did not know it was happening.	O ne a sa tsebe hore e etsahala.
Maybe now he was coming.	Mohlomong joale o ne a tla.
It made me walk even harder.	Ho ile ha etsa hore ke tsamaee ka thata le ho feta.
That's right.	Ee ho joalo.
Not much is happening there.	Ha ho tse ngata tse etsahalang moo.
Think before you act.	Nahana pele u etsa joalo.
That is not a good thing.	Seo hase ntho e ntle.
After that it was always.	Ka mor'a moo e ne e le kamehla.
Thank you very much.	Ke leboha haholo.
This is a strange thing.	Sena ke ntho e makatsang.
I can't say he enjoyed it.	Nke ke ka re o ne a e thabetse.
You need to do a better job.	O hloka ho etsa mosebetsi o betere.
I have to be more important than that.	Ke tlameha ho ba oa bohlokoa ho feta moo.
Either way it's fine.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe ke hantle.
But that is what we have.	Empa ke seo re nang le sona.
We lived our lives the way we wanted to.	Re ne re phela kamoo re ratang kateng.
If he didn't want to do something, he didn't do it.	Haeba a ne a sa batle ho etsa ntho e itseng, o ne a sa e etse.
I think they can do really good things.	Ke nahana hore ba ka etsa lintho tse ntle haholo.
I tried this, but I kept having the same issue.	Ke ile ka leka sena, empa ka tsoela pele ho ba le taba e tšoanang.
We are stronger than they are.	Re matla ho feta bona.
But he was strong, that was clear.	Empa o ne a le matla, seo se ne se hlakile.
This is almost as easy as it comes.	Sena se batla se le bonolo joalo ka ha se tla.
There was nothing we could do there.	Ho ne ho se letho leo re ka le etsang moo.
He lived every day.	O ne a phela letsatsi le letsatsi.
We have not seen.	Ha re e-so bone.
I never said no.	Ha kea ka ka hlola ke re.
This seems to work well.	Sena se bonahala se sebetsa hantle.
Thanks for watching !.	Ke leboha ho shebella!.
I'm still trying to understand what happened.	Ke ntse ke leka ho utloisisa se etsahetseng.
Maybe both were true.	Mohlomong ka bobeli e ne e le 'nete.
It seems so old.	Ho bonahala khale hakae.
Or your family.	Kapa lelapa la hau.
Write the first things first.	Ngola lintho tsa pele pele.
The cash flow was fun.	Chelete ea chelete e ne e le monate.
I was the only one standing next to her.	Ke 'na feela ea ileng a ema haufi le eena.
Thank you so much for the comments.	Ke leboha haholo bakeng sa maikutlo.
He left the room without saying a word.	O ile a tsoa ka kamoreng a sa bua letho.
But surprisingly, they knew even more.	Empa ho makatsang ke hore ba ne ba tseba le ho feta.
I kept it for everyone.	Ke ne ke e boloka ho bohle.
No one can talk to him.	Ha ho motho ea ka buang le eena.
But first we needed to see this.	Empa pele re ne re hloka ho bona sena.
She is very happy about it.	O e thabetse haholo.
I really did not want the truth.	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa batle 'nete.
They already had my money.	Ba ne ba se ba ntse ba e-na le chelete ea ka.
She loved him, too.	E ne e mo rata, hape.
Lots of people, lots of food, come to him.	Batho ba bangata, lijo tse ngata, li mo tla.
For any good that you will do.	Bakeng sa molemo ofe kapa ofe oo o tla o etsa.
But I wonder.	Empa kea ipotsa.
We know nothing more than that.	Ha re tsebe letho ho feta moo.
I can't find anything.	Ha ke fumane letho.
He is waiting for his father's arrival.	O emetse ho fihla ha ntate.
I'm crying.	Ke ntse ke lla.
Believe it or not, it is usually true.	E lumela kapa che, hangata ke 'nete.
He feels tired.	A ikutloa a khathetse.
Although they would also be important.	Le hoja le tsona li ne li tla ba bohlokoa.
Work consumed family life.	Mosebetsi o ne o ja bophelo ba lelapa.
I don't know when he'll get here.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o tla fihla neng mona.
A book is a book that is easy to read and understand.	Buka ke buka e bonolo ho e bala le ho e utloisisa.
Obviously you want something from me.	Ho hlakile hore o batla ho hong ho nna.
I hope it will help you.	Ke tšepa hore e tla u thusa.
It does not matter.	Ha e bohlokoa.
I do not know if this will be a problem.	Ha ke tsebe hore na taba ena e tla ba bothata.
I wanted to go.	Ke ne ke batla ho tsamaea.
But it was not the only one.	Empa e ne e se eona feela.
But this is my job.	Empa ona ke mosebetsi oa ka.
However, I did not have to.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke sa tlameha ho etsa joalo.
It will take years.	Ho tla nka lilemo.
He needed to tell them.	O ne a hloka ho ba bolella.
That would be a wonderful place to live.	Seo e ne e tla ba sebaka se setle haholo sa ho phela.
It was easy to see what they were thinking.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho bona seo ba se nahanang.
You can do the same.	U ka etsa ntho e tšoanang.
And he always works in the end.	'Me o lula a sebetsa qetellong.
You can still live your life.	O ntse o ka phela bophelo ba hao.
It is important to take care of yourself and your family.	Ho bohlokoa ho hlokomela uena le oa hau.
I knew a lot.	Ke ne ke tseba haholo.
One was that it was fun to talk to him.	E 'ngoe e ne e le hore ho ne ho le monate ho bua le eena.
It was a beautiful place.	E ne e le sebaka se setle.
Think about what you would like to eat.	Nahana ka mokhoa oo u ka ratang ho ja.
Most people loved to swim.	Batho ba bangata ba ne ba rata ho sesa.
It will not cry.	E ke ke ea lla.
.	.
Home again, home again.	Hae hape, hae hape.
But there is no help at all for these people.	Empa haho thuso ho hang bakeng sa batho bana.
I did one.	Ke entse e le 'ngoe.
They are very clear.	Li hlakile hantle.
They can't get through here.	Ba ke ke ba feta mona.
But he seemed unable to write without it.	Empa ho ne ho bonahala a sa khone ho ngola ntle le eona.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho sa le joalo.
Then you can apply for anything.	Joale u ka etsa kopo ea eng kapa eng.
Or, for that matter, anyone who wished to write.	Kapa, ​​bakeng sa taba eo, mang kapa mang ea neng a lakatsa ho ngola.
That is not what happened here.	Ha se sona se etsahetseng mona.
Take them with you.	Li nke le uena.
However, singing was useless.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bina ho ne ho se na thuso.
He held it, but a little.	O ile a e tšoara, empa hanyane.
We need to talk about it.	Re lokela ho bua ka eona.
They would not be healthy.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba phela hantle.
They want a place for their children, he said.	Ba batla sebaka sa bana ba bona, a re.
The kids did it.	Bana ba e entse.
He entered.	A kena.
I will not let him go.	Nke ke ka mo tlohela.
That you know how to know.	Ke hore o tsebe ho tseba.
I can't get enough of it.	Ha ke khone ho e lekana.
However, I have a question.	Leha ho le joalo, ke na le potso.
I'm just suggesting.	Ke fana ka maikutlo feela.
You probably would not understand.	Mohlomong u ne u ke ke ua utloisisa.
It can be very fun.	E ka ba monate haholo.
This has been very difficult for you.	Sena se bile boima haholo ho uena.
We will never forget our strengths and our weaknesses.	Ha e le hantle re ke ke ra lebala matla a rona le bohlokoa ba rona.
This we want.	Sena rea ​​se batla.
We are not talking about it.	Ha re bue ka eona.
I get that.	Ke fumana seo.
Then he falls.	Joale oa oa.
Never tell me the problems.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua mpolella mathata.
I'll see you at the party.	Ke tla u bona moketeng.
It's a thing.	Ke ntho.
The book does not exist.	Buka ha e eo.
You are not sure what this means so it could mean anything.	Ha u na bonnete ba hore na sena se bolela eng kahoo se ka bolela eng kapa eng.
Leave that to me alone.	Tlohela seo ho nna feela.
It refuses to use it.	E hana ho e sebelisa.
Are you talking about him?	Na u bua ka eena?
And it did not.	'Me ha hoa ka ha e-ba joalo.
Who is that man?	Monna eo ke mang?
He was visible.	O ne a bonahala.
But we do not have that.	Empa ha re na seo.
Is there a house nearby?	Ho na le ntlo haufinyane?
Go ahead, find out.	Tsoela pele, fumana.
But that was many years ago now.	Empa hoo e ne e le lilemo tse ngata tse fetileng hona joale.
Here it is, here it is.	Ke mona, taba ke ena.
These things happen, though not always.	Lintho tsena li etsahala, leha e se hangata.
Maybe they did the same thing in this area.	Mohlomong ba entse ntho e tšoanang sebakeng sena.
Which is a good thing.	E leng ntho e ntle.
What can I do.	Nka etsa eng.
He found no problem with this idea.	Ha aa ka a fumana bothata ka mohopolo ona.
I mean, really, very bad.	Ke bolela, ehlile, e mpe haholo.
I meet them.	Ke kopana le bona.
But that doesn't seem to be a problem here.	Empa seo ha se bonahale e le bothata mona.
Sleep well.	Robala hantle.
He wanted it bad.	O ne a e batla e le mpe.
Good job for both of you.	Mosebetsi o motle ho lona ka bobeli.
The same is true of his handling of money.	Ho joalo le ka chelete ea hae ea ho tšoara chelete.
Now, it's time to do it.	Jwale, ke nako ya ho e etsa.
Some are worse than others.	Tse ling li mpe ho feta tse ling.
I'm so sorry, she said.	Ke masoabi haholo, o ile a re.
Some people do what they do for money.	Batho ba bang ba etsa seo ba se etsang bakeng sa chelete.
He soon said that they should.	Ho e-s’o ee kae o ile a bolela hore ba lokela ho etsa joalo.
Police arrested several people yesterday.	Mapolesa a ile a tšoara batho ba bangata maobane.
We give you a lot of savings!	Re u fa chelete e ngata ea ho boloka!
You do not know why he left.	Ha u tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ile a tsamaea.
They were useless before it.	Ba ne ba se na thuso pele ho eona.
We'll keep him, of course.	Re tla mo boloka, ho hlakile.
So my kids say.	Kahoo bana ba ka ba re.
You can even ask him a question from time to time.	U ka ba ua mo botsa potso nako le nako.
But the truth is even worse.	Empa ’nete e bohloko le ho feta.
But it is a difficult thing to think about.	Empa ke ntho e thata ho nahana ka eona.
The children must have watched their father do this.	E tlameha ebe bana ba ile ba shebella ntate oa bona ha a etsa sena.
It is the decision of a very high person.	Ke qeto ea motho ea phahameng haholo.
It's not news.	Ha se litaba.
I will help you find them.	Ke tla u thusa ho li fumana.
He refused, but he won.	A hana, empa a mo hlola.
He said it would not happen.	O itse e ke ke ya etsahala.
But now, they just can't talk about it anymore.	Empa joale, ha ba sa khona ho bua ka eona feela.
He too had a chance.	Le eena o bile le monyetla.
There was something he did not tell her.	Ho ne ho e-na le ntho eo a neng a sa mo bolelle eona.
He knew full well that one had to keep his feet.	O ne a tseba hantle hore motho o lokela ho boloka maoto a hae.
I try to read things.	Ke leka ho bala lintho.
It's not my best.	Ha se molemo ka ho fetisisa oa ka.
When we arrived, the place was empty.	Ha re fihla, sebaka seo se ne se se na batho.
He has a good father and mother.	O na le ntate le mme ba molemo.
It seems like a great place to be.	Ho bonahala eka ke sebaka se setle ho ba teng.
But there can be a way.	Empa ho na le hore ho ka ba le tsela.
They all get that.	Kaofela ba fumana seo.
And you may know why.	'Me u ka' na ua tseba lebaka.
We can do everything.	Re ka etsa tsohle.
Several children play.	Bana ba 'maloa ba bapala.
We both knew what he was going to do with it.	Ka bobeli re ne re tseba seo a tla se etsa ka eona.
My friends do not talk to me.	Metsoalle ea ka ha e bue le 'na.
Probably very new.	Mohlomong e ncha haholo.
Although there was no one else.	Le hoja ho ne ho se motho e mong.
You know you are.	Ua tseba hore uena.
Several friends visited us last week.	Metsoalle e ’maloa e ile ea re etela bekeng e fetileng.
He knew it wasn't an image.	O ne a tseba hore e ne e se setšoantšo.
I'm not sure about anything.	Ha ke na bonnete ka letho.
You are the one who does that as you know everyone's life.	Ke uena ea etsang joalo ka ha u tseba bophelo ba motho e mong le e mong.
I know this may not be what you wanted.	Kea tseba hore sena e ke ke ea e-ba seo u neng u se batla.
He was often absent, working and saving money.	Hangata o ne a le sieo, a sebetsa a bile a boloka chelete.
She opened her arms.	A bula matsoho a hae.
One dog came out and another dog came in.	Ntja e 'ngoe ea tsoa 'me ntja e 'ngoe ea kena.
Look.	Sheba.
Does this make sense, no.	Na see se etsa hore e se be taba, che.
I mean they were many.	Ke bolela hore ba ne ba le bangata.
Is there a way back?	Na ho na le mokhoa oa ho khutlela morao?
Which, of course, he did.	E leng seo, ehlile, a se entseng.
It happens.	Hoa etsahala.
There were also good times.	Hape ho ne ho e-na le linako tse monate.
If not I have another idea.	Haeba ha ho joalo ke na le mohopolo o mong hape.
Those things are certainly wonderful.	Ka sebele lintho tseo li monate.
They eat everything.	Ba ja tsohle.
We went there.	Re ile ra ea moo.
I do not know why.	Ha ke tsebe lebaka.
Do not do that in your opinion.	U se ke ua etsa joalo ka maikutlo a hau.
However, he could see nothing.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa bone letho.
He really needed to get through this group.	O ne a hlile a hloka ho feta sehlopheng sena.
Not at all.	Ho hang ha ho joalo.
They want it hard.	Ba batla hore ho be thata.
I can't imagine it.	Ha ke khone ho e nahana.
I just like to wear this one.	Ke rata ho apara ena feela.
I will take care of this.	Ke tla hlokomela sena.
I'm sorry about him.	Ke masoabi ka eena.
He needs time.	O hloka nako.
He never planned.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a rera.
No one knew what had happened.	Ha ho motho ea neng a tseba se etsahetseng.
I really did it, he thought.	Ke hlile ke e entse, a nahana.
We do not understand it.	Ha re e utloisise.
The rest left.	Ba bang kaofela ba ile ba tloha.
I will find him.	Ke tla mo fumana.
Maybe that's the way he talks.	Mohlomong ke tsela eo a buang ka eona.
I hope you know what you do.	Kea tšepa u tseba seo u se etsang.
Who do we think we should be.	Ke mang eo re nahanang hore re lokela ho ba eena.
They will want you.	Ba tla u batla.
I can now say.	Ke se ke khona ho bolela.
It looked new.	E ne e shebahala e le ncha.
No one knows for sure.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle.
It's up to you.	Ho ho uena.
It will definitely return.	Ka sebele e tla khutla.
It was my idea.	E ne e le mohopolo oa ka.
I have never seen it.	Nna ha ba eso bone.
This food is delicious.	Lijo tsena li monate.
Then along with the	Joale hammoho le ea
It is one of my favorite foods.	Ke se seng sa lijo tseo ke li ratang haholo.
He could not live.	O ne a ke ke a phela.
You do not know what to expect.	Ha o tsebe hore na o tla kopana le eng.
I have to spend time wanting to know more or work harder.	Ke tlameha ho qeta nako ke batla ho tseba haholoanyane kapa ho sebetsa ho feta.
It's very fun.	Ho monate haholo.
Otherwise, he would not have done so.	Ho seng joalo, o ne a ke ke a etsa joalo.
Of some kind.	Ea mofuta o itseng.
They love us.	Baa re rata.
I did whatever he wanted.	Ke ne ke etsa eng kapa eng eo a e batlang.
Wait for your turn.	Ema nako ea hau.
You will feel better.	U tla ikutloa betere.
It is becoming increasingly difficult to find a job.	Ho ntse ho e-ba thata le ho feta ho fumana mosebetsi.
I can read a book.	Ke khona ho bala buka.
Our lives are at stake.	Ho phela ha rōna ho kotsing.
She's my baby, she thought.	Ke ngoana oa ka, a nahana joalo.
I think you know.	Ke nahana hore oa tseba.
I do not believe he does this.	Ha ke lumele hore o etsa sena.
I took you here.	Ke u nkile mona.
Stop thinking so.	Tlohela ho nahana joalo.
And you can say that in class.	Mme o ka bolela seo ka phaposing.
I know a little bit.	Ke tseba hanyane.
Yet we know that is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo rea tseba hore ha ho joalo.
I had to stay.	Ke ne ke tlameha ho lula.
I will not let you go.	Nke ke ka o tlohela.
She was glad to see him again.	O ne a thabetse ho mo bona hape.
I just used the last one this morning.	Ke sa tsoa sebelisa ea ho qetela hoseng hona.
He can stand.	A ka ema.
Now we had the best thing we had.	Hona joale re ne re e-na le ntho e ntle ka ho fetisisa eo re nang le eona.
I think we can.	Ke nahana hore re ka khona.
But it is.	Empa ho joalo.
It’s fun, really.	E monate, ka 'nete.
You can work from there.	U ka sebetsa ho tloha moo.
You can bring your own coffee.	U ka tla le kofi ea hau.
Believe in you.	Lumela ho uena.
For some, this may be the case.	Ho ba bang, sena e ka ’na ea e-ba ’nete.
That decision was my fault.	Qeto eo e ne e le molato oa ka kaofela.
The child did well.	Ngoana o entse hantle.
It has to happen only once, though.	E tlameha ho etsahala hang feela, leha ho le joalo.
However, how close is such information to reality?	Leha ho le joalo, litaba tse joalo li haufi hakae le ’nete?
He gave up his power.	A tlohela matla a hae.
If anyone could, it would be him.	Haeba mang kapa mang a ka khona, e ne e tla ba eena.
There are several near the road.	Ho na le tse 'maloa haufi le tsela.
I will look at him.	Ke tla mo sheba.
Can you wear them ?.	O ka li apara?.
It was a wonderful life.	E ne e le bophelo bo makatsang.
You mean the thing is there in time by giving, well, time.	U bolela moo ntho e leng teng ka nako ka ho fana, hantle, nako.
Some of them are closer to the truth than others.	Ba bang ba bona ba haufi le ’nete ho feta ba bang.
I don't like him here.	Ha ke mo rate mona.
You can too.	Le uena u ka kena.
But he kept trying.	Empa o ile a ’na a leka.
But he did not need it.	Empa o ne a sa hloke.
Obviously this is not the law.	Ho hlakile hore ona ha se molao.
Instead, he stayed with his team.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a lula le sehlopha sa hae.
I love her so much.	Ke mo rata haholo.
However, it was caught.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ile ha tšoaroa.
And this is the best place.	'Me sena ke sebaka se setle ka ho fetisisa.
I know it doesn't make sense.	Kea tseba hore ha e na kelello.
It was very good.	E ne e le molemo haholo.
He was not sure if he wanted to.	O ne a sena bonnete ba hore o batla ho etsa jwalo.
He did not know what was going on.	O ne a sa tsebe se etsahalang.
He told us that.	O re boleletse seo.
He died three days after the accident.	O ile a hlokahala matsatsi a mararo ka mor'a kotsi eo.
He enjoyed it.	O ne a thabetse eona.
He can do anything with them and with them.	A ka etsa eng kapa eng ho bona le ka bona.
The same is true with a simple form of this.	Ho joalo feela ka mofuta o bonolo oa sena.
Yes, he should know that he could not get everything he wanted.	E, o lokela ho tseba hore o ne a ke ke a fumana ntho leha e le efe eo a e batlang.
We start with a strange story.	Re qala ka taba e makatsang.
You have to find your way.	U tlameha ho fumana tsela ea hau.
I asked him to do so.	Ke ile ka mo kopa hore a etse joalo.
Handle the car well.	Tšoara koloi hantle.
You will not return.	U ke ke ua khutla.
When he had finished eating, he fell asleep.	Ha a qeta ho ja, a robala.
He came out of it.	A tsoa ho eona.
You were great.	U ne u le moholo.
And they know this very well.	Mme ba tseba taba ena haholo.
I feel your pain.	Ke utloa bohloko ba hao.
I was pregnant.	Ke ne ke na le mpa.
He expects to retire soon.	O lebeletse ho tlohela mosebetsi haufinyane.
I'm just happy.	Ke thabela feela.
Because that's what he does.	Hobane ke seo a se etsang.
However, it did help.	Leha ho le joalo, e ile ea u thusa.
He returned home exhausted.	O ile a khutlela hae a khathetse.
I mean it was for me.	Ke bolela hore e ne e le bakeng sa ka.
You know now.	O a tseba jwale.
It is no longer useful.	Ha e sa na thuso.
I hope I heard your question.	Ke tšepa hore ke utloile potso ea hau.
Come anytime.	Tlo nako efe kapa efe.
You can have another child.	U ka ba le ngoana e mong.
Sometimes he did this.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a etsa sena.
I drink a lot of coffee.	Ke noa kofi e ngata haholo.
It is useless today.	Ha e na thuso kajeno.
Come home with me.	Tlo hae le nna.
I just want to keep playing and writing.	Ke batla feela ho tsoela pele ho bapala le ho ngola.
He wished he could keep it this way.	O ne a lakatsa eka a ka e boloka ka tsela ena.
I am now working on my starting point.	Hona joale ke sebetsa ka mokhoa oa ka oa ho qala.
The reason it took a day.	Lebaka le nkile letsatsi.
This took him a long time to do.	Sena se ile sa mo nka nako e telele hore a se etse.
He has no time for this.	Ha a na nako ea sena.
Be careful.	Hlokomela hantle.
I could understand it.	Ke ne ke khona ho e utloisisa.
So we'll see.	Kahoo re tla bona.
The children refused his money.	Bana ba ile ba hana chelete ea hae.
That was the last time we heard of that woman.	Eo e ne e le lekhetlo la ho qetela re utloa ka mosali eo.
No one ever told me that every woman is strong.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a mpolella hore mosali e mong le e mong o matla.
Man lives every day.	Motho o phela letsatsi le letsatsi.
But tomorrow did not come.	Empa hosane ha ea ka ea fihla.
He was just right there.	O ne a le teng hantle feela.
I did not see him coming.	Ha kea ka ka mo bona a tla.
Sometimes we did both.	Ka linako tse ling re ne re etsa ka bobeli.
That's not what it is.	Ha se seo e leng sona.
He said it was his fault.	O ne a re ke molato wa hae.
It is my job to see these things.	Ke mosebetsi oa ka ho bona lintho tsena.
I really mean.	Ke hlile ke bolela.
Amazing, really amazing.	E makatsang, e makatsang ruri.
We will go.	Re tla tsamaea.
And the people saw what they expected.	Mme batho ba bona seo ba neng ba lebeletse ho se bona.
Make a lot of money.	Etsa chelete e ngata.
They want to hear something new.	Ba batla ho utloa ntho e ncha.
With some startup problems.	Ka mathata a mang a ho qala.
Previous work.	Mosebetsi o fetileng.
What it is, it knows everything we do.	Hore na ke eng, e tseba tsohle tseo re li etsang.
They are other people.	Ke batho ba bang.
He had looked at her then.	O ne a ile a mo sheba ka nako eo.
Then we heard nothing.	Joale ha rea ​​ka ra utloa letho.
We were really talking.	Re ne re hlile re bolela.
I never thought my stuff would be so big.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore lintho tsa ka li tla ba ngata.
I know how you were trying to help.	Kea tseba hore na u ne u leka ho thusa joang.
I belong to her today.	Ke ea hae kajeno.
I have not forgotten.	Ha kea lebala.
You are the first.	Ke uena oa pele.
I don't talk much about him anymore.	Ha ke sa bua haholo ka eena.
We are talking about life.	Re bua ka bophelo.
But the truth can be worse.	Empa 'nete e ka ba mpe le ho feta.
And it feels so good.	'Me e ikutloa e le monate haholo.
And he saw more.	Mme a bona ho feta.
This will take time.	Sena se tla nka nako.
He seems to be doing very well.	O bonahala a sebetsa hantle haholo.
You just have to understand that it's hard for me.	U tlameha feela ho utloisisa hore ho thata ho 'na.
And they were.	Mme ba ne ba .
The rest were gone.	Ba bang kaofela ba ne ba ile.
Either way it works now.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe e ea sebetsa hona joale.
So it will not be important.	Kahoo e ke ke ea e-ba ea bohlokoa.
I refuse it.	Kea e hana.
And your child has never loved you.	'Me ngoana oa hau ha a e-so u rate.
You really know the place when you visit it.	U hlile u tseba sebaka ha u se etela haholo.
Water is an important factor in this area.	Metsi ke ntho ea bohlokoa sebakeng sena.
I like that boy.	Ke rata moshanyana eo.
She just wants to be a mother.	O mpa a batla ho ba mme.
I can't at all.	Ha ke khone ho hang.
This will not happen.	Sena se ke ke sa etsahala.
I had no idea it would be so good.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore e tla ba ntle hakana.
Our job is to find it.	Mosebetsi oa rona ke ho e fumana.
Power group.	Sehlopha sa matla.
I mentioned another one.	Ke ile ka bua ka e 'ngoe.
The questions were very difficult.	Lipotso li ne li le boima haholo.
So there are good things to come.	Kahoo ho na le lintho tse ntle tse tlang.
He was tired, but he was happy where he was.	O ne a khathetse, empa a thabetse moo a neng a le teng.
So they give it away.	Kahoo ba e fana.
Some of them did not.	Ba bang ba bona ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
I can't find it at all.	Ha ke e fumane ho hang.
It was not a happy day.	E ne e se letsatsi le monate.
The food is simple, but it works well.	Lijo li bonolo, empa li sebetsa hantle.
I just want to say this.	Ke batla ho bolela sena feela.
He made sure.	O ile a etsa bonnete.
Surprisingly.	Ka mokhoa o makatsang.
Type is endangered.	Mofuta o kotsing.
But in a new way.	Empa ka tsela e ncha.
Sometimes we buy things.	Ka linako tse ling re reka lintho.
I do not know what he is talking about.	Ha ke tsebe hore na o bua ka eng.
Nothing like the other times.	Ha ho letho le tšoanang le linako tse ling.
He didn't care.	O ne a sa tsotelle.
Water is the most important thing.	Metsi ke ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
I'd like some water, please.	Ke kopa metsi ka kopo.
That's what he is.	Ke seo a leng sona.
He wanted to keep his name because he loved it.	O ne a batla ho boloka lebitso la hae hobane a ne a le rata.
He is looking for her, and he is accustomed to getting what she wants.	Oa mo batla, 'me o tloaetse ho fumana seo a se batlang.
Of course, we expect that.	Ha e le hantle, re lebeletse seo.
Yes, they are.	E, ba hantle.
No one asked questions.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a botsa lipotso.
There is no help there.	Haho thuso moo.
How much time do you spend at work?	O qeta nako mang mosebetsing?
That's how they found him with us.	Ke kamoo ba ileng ba mo fumana a e-na le rona kateng.
I think his father is the one with the most money.	Ke nahana hore ntate oa hae ke eena ea nang le chelete e ngata.
I am very tired.	Ke khathetse haholo.
He would take good care of her.	O ne a tla mo boloka hantle.
Then there was none.	Joale ho ne ho se na.
I'm better now.	Ke betere jwale.
He seems to be in the area.	Ho bonahala a le sebakeng seo.
That's what he said.	Ke seo a se buileng.
They are not mine.	Ha se tsa ka.
I'm not sure what a good one is.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na e ntle ke efe.
It was the best, so far.	E ne e le molemo ka ho fetisisa, ho fihlela mona.
Never look for friends.	Le ka mohla u se ke ua batla metsoalle.
He wants to help her.	O batla ho mo thusa.
Equality is fun.	Ho lekana ho monate.
That one is you.	Eo e mong ke uena.
I want to be real.	Ke batla ho ba oa sebele.
This meant that we could make a lot of money.	Sena se ne se bolela hore re ka etsa chelete e ngata.
She was glad she now had someone to talk to.	O ne a thabetse hore ebe joale o na le motho eo a ka buang le eena.
However, I decided to go.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ile ka etsa qeto ea ho tsamaea.
It was not at all he never came.	Ho ne ho se joalo ho hang ha oa ka o fihla.
It has questions, please.	E na le lipotso, ka kopo.
Neither can I.	Le 'na nke ke ka khona.
But sometimes there is no reason.	Empa ka linako tse ling ha ho na lebaka.
Then they start again.	Ebe ba qala hape.
There is no reason not to have it.	Ha ho na lebaka la ho se be le eona.
This is a very bad time.	Ena ke nako e mpe haholo.
Finally he said.	Qetellong a re.
Because it doesn't matter.	Hobane hase ea bohlokoa.
This has the potential for simplicity.	Sena se na le monyetla oa ho ba bonolo.
He still did not understand.	O ne a ntse a sa utloisise.
Think for a moment.	Nahana ka sebele.
I love it this way.	Ke e rata ka tsela ena.
It can go both ways, too.	E ka tsamaea ka bobeli, hape.
It is very important to be punctual.	Ho bohlokoa haholo ho boloka nako.
It can be bad.	E ka ba mpe.
I did not speak to him.	Ha kea ka ka bua le eena.
Of course he would not.	Ha e le hantle o ne a ke ke a etsa joalo.
I do not want you to see.	Ha ke batle hore o bone.
He was afraid to talk too much.	O ne a tšaba ho bua haholo.
There would certainly be no day to get out of it.	Ka sebele ho ka be ho se na letsatsi la ho tsoa ho eona.
It takes time.	E hloka nako.
I don't like it very much.	Ha ke e rate haholo.
This means .	Hona ho bolela .
However, he did not do so.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa etsa joalo.
One reason is that some people want them.	Lebaka le leng ke hore batho ba bang baa li batla.
I can speak.	Ke khona ho bua.
However, there were people who saw enough.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le batho ba neng ba bone ho lekaneng.
We will write more.	Re tla ngola ho feta.
If they are, well.	Haeba li teng, hantle.
We just call.	Re letsetsa feela.
It's here, of course.	E teng mona, ka 'nete.
Neither should we.	Le rōna ha rea ​​lokela ho etsa joalo.
That is the mind.	Seo ke kelello.
It's a thing of the past.	Ke ntho ya nako e fetileng.
So please note here.	Kahoo ka kopo hlokomela mona.
I think a lot of people don’t get that book.	Ke nahana hore batho ba bangata ha ba fumane buka eo.
He would stay.	O ne a tla lula.
None of them are around.	Ha ho le ea mong oa bona haufi.
We will never be sure.	Ha ho mohla re tla ba le bonnete.
Like it meant anything.	Eka e ne e bolela eng kapa eng.
Some would have thought it dangerous.	Ba bang ba ne ba tla nahana hore ke kotsi.
No one could have done it better.	Ha ho motho ea neng a ka e etsa betere.
Power means life to us.	Matla a bolela bophelo ho rona.
We will be there first.	Re tla ba teng pele.
Its location is.	Sebaka sa eona ke.
The problem persists.	Bothata bo ntse bo tsoela pele.
There was not much time.	Ho ne ho se na nako e ngata.
He spends a lot of time there.	O qeta nako e ngata haholo moo.
The most important thing is to make you go.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa ke ho etsa hore u tsamaee.
Do not sleep.	U se ke ua robala.
It's been a week here.	E se e le beke mona.
It wasn't a close family, you see.	E ne e se lelapa le haufi, le a bona.
It's not fun to talk about.	Ha ho monate ho bua.
The more powerful the method.	Mokhoa o matla haholoanyane.
We may not spend much time there.	Re ka ’na ra se ke ra qeta nako e ngata moo.
She feels happier than ever.	O ikutloa a thabile ho feta hona joale.
Probably not.	Mohlomong e ke ke ea etsahala.
There is no danger.	Haho kotsi.
It was really very sad.	E ne e hlile e le masoabi haholo.
Things to do and things not to do.	Lintho tseo u lokelang ho li etsa le tseo u sa lokelang ho li etsa.
Just good news.	Litaba tse monate feela.
He did not have to live.	O ne a sa lokela ho phela.
It had seen better days.	E ne e bone matsatsi a betere.
It is a foolish mistake.	Ke phoso e hlokang kelello.
Everyone is there.	E mong le e mong o teng.
Moreover, it is not our business to know.	Ho feta moo, ha se taba ea rona ho tseba.
Danger, or not.	Kotsi, kapa che.
It finally happened.	Qetellong ho ile ha etsahala.
It was very painful.	Ho ne ho le bohloko haholo.
She was wearing new shoes.	O ne a apere lieta tse ncha.
But he seems to be doing so.	Empa ho bonahala a etsa joalo.
All of these are in an easy-to-reach place.	Tsena kaofela li sebakeng se bonolo sa ho tsamaea.
However, another family did.	Leha ho le joalo, lelapa le leng le ile la etsa joalo.
This should fix the problem.	Sena se lokela ho lokisa bothata.
They just look more closely together.	Ba mpa ba sheba hammoho haholoanyane.
Now this is very interesting.	Joale sena se monate haholo.
It would be great to have both!	Ho ka ba monate ho ba le tsena ka bobeli !.
He wished he had some money to travel.	O ne a lakatsa eka a ka be a e-na le chelete ea ho tsamaea.
Both are very good.	Ka bobeli li ntle haholo.
I'm here a little bit.	Ke mona hanyane.
I don't think they will.	Ha ke nahane hore ba tla etsa joalo.
I had only been here a few days.	Ke ne ke bile mona matsatsi a 'maloa feela.
All and all.	Tsohle le bohle.
My father was even happier.	Ntate o ne a thabile haholoanyane.
I can get it all.	Nka fumana tsohle.
But he did something wrong that night.	Empa o ile a etsa ntho e mpe bosiung boo.
He walked into the front room.	O ile a tsamaea ka kamoreng e ka pele.
If you like, you will.	Haeba u rata, u tla etsa joalo.
It doesn't matter why you are here, just that you are here.	Ha ho na taba hore na hobaneng o le teng, feela hore o teng mona.
It really does work for me.	Ehlile e etsa ho nna.
Or it is not necessary, or both.	Kapa ha ho hlokahale, kapa ka bobeli.
"Thank you," he said.	A re, "kea leboha,"
But fixing it is easy.	Empa ho lokisa ho bonolo.
Only then will you know.	Ke ha o tla tseba.
More and more people will be leaving.	Batho ba bangata le ho feta ba tla tsamaea.
I can't sit still.	Ha ke khone ho lula.
It can be fun too.	Ho ka ba monate hape.
Do not save anything in the retrieval function.	U se ke ua boloka letho mosebetsing oa ho khutlela morao.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
He wondered if he would ever meet them again.	A ipotsa hore na ebe o tla tloha a kopana le bona.
She is even happier.	O bile o thabile.
And he knew they did.	Mme o ne a tseba hore ba entse jwalo.
I would love to see him so much.	Nka thabela ho mo bona haholo.
Start hard.	Qala ka thata.
And it really was.	'Me ho ne ho hlile ho le joalo.
I have no strength.	Ha ke na matla.
Many of these things.	Lintho tsena tse ngata.
Take our place.	Tšoara sebaka sa rona.
I knew him from the beginning.	Ke ne ke mo tseba ho tloha pele.
I know the law.	Ke tseba molao.
He sits down and thinks about the past.	O lula fatše 'me o nahana ka nako e fetileng.
I'm happy for them, really.	Ke ba thabetse, ruri.
That would not have happened.	Seo se ne se ke ke sa etsahala.
I have no problem with it.	Ha ke na mathata ka eona.
I offer the same suggestion now.	Ke fana ka tlhahiso e tšoanang hona joale.
It is not a very good book.	Ha se buka e ntle haholo.
They can be anywhere.	Ba ka ba kae kapa kae.
Some are.	Ba bang ba.
As long as it's fun to watch.	Ha feela ho ntse ho le monate ho shebella.
She was happy to go with him.	O ne a thabetse ho tsamaea le eena.
There was nothing that they did that seemed to help.	Ho ne ho se letho leo ba le entseng le neng le bonahala le thusa.
That means us.	Seo se bolela rona.
I do not know the place.	Ha ke tsebe sebaka seo.
I think it was you.	Ke nahana hore e ne e le uena.
His house is nearby.	Ntlo ea hae e haufi.
I found them.	Ke ba fumane.
It certainly works for me.	Ka sebele ea sebetsa bakeng sa ka.
I know you want to be with me.	Kea tseba hore u batla ho ba le 'na.
Never say it.	O seke oa e bua le ka mohla.
The best kind.	Mofuta o motle ka ho fetisisa.
Here is the thing.	Ntho ke ena.
So something happens.	Ka hona ho na le ntho e etsahalang.
More than that.	Ho feta moo.
And there have been many other times since.	'Me ho bile le linako tse ling tse ngata ho tloha ka nako eo.
Where are you going from there?	Ho tloha moo u ea kae?
I would come back.	Ke ne ke tla khutla.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Ho ne ho se letho le neng le le bothata.
And think of it.	Mme nahana eng.
No one will know.	Ha ho motho ea tla tseba.
I want nothing more than this.	Ha ke so batle letho ho feta mona.
I had a feeling that something was wrong.	Ke ne ke na le maikutlo a hore ho na le ho phoso.
If you have nothing, get what you have.	Haeba u se na letho, fumana seo u nang le sona.
They simply refused to let him go.	Ba ne ba mpa ba hana ho mo lumella.
Many issues were relatively easy to resolve.	Litaba tse ngata li ne li batla li le bonolo ho li lokisa.
Live after all.	Phela ka mor'a tsohle.
Or that you start to feel bad about touching them.	Kapa hore u qala ho utloa bohloko ka ho li tšoara.
It is very important.	E bohlokoa haholo.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
But this was true.	Empa sena e ne e le 'nete.
They met.	Ba ile ba kopana.
If that's what you like, it's fun.	Haeba ke seo u se ratang, se monate.
It was delicious.	E ne e le monate haholo.
You have never said anything like this before.	Ha o so ka o bua ntho e kang ena pele.
I tried my best to find it.	Ke ile ka leka ka matla ho e fumana.
He didn't know but he felt he would do it.	O ne a sa tsebe empa o ne a ikutloa hore o tla etsa joalo.
I would go to him with water instead.	Ke ne ke tla ea ho eena ka metsi ho e-na le hoo.
He continued as before.	A tsoela pele joaloka pele.
And water, too.	Le metsi, hape.
I tried to stay.	Ke ile ka leka ho lula.
They are not good.	Ha li ntle.
He felt tired.	O ile a ikutloa a khathetse.
I have not used this.	Ha kea sebelisa sena.
In my opinion though.	Ka maikutlo a ka leha ho le joalo.
We were still visible.	Re ne re ntse re bonahala.
He comes to us.	O tla ho rona.
I just wanted you to know that.	Ke ne ke batla feela hore o tsebe seo.
Because they will eat more.	Hobane ba tla ja haholo ho feta.
But we did nothing.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra etsa letho.
That was not the case.	E ne e se eona eo.
I was used to this thing very well.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ntho ena hantle.
It seems easy!	Ho bonahala ho le bonolo!
The task was relatively easy.	Mosebetsi ona o ne o batla o le bonolo.
He still did not know her.	O ne a ntse a sa mo tsebe.
What do you think of that?	U nahana'ng ka seo?
So you can make it personal.	Kahoo u ka e etsa hore e be ea motho ka mong.
However, that did not happen.	Leha ho le joalo, ha hoa ka ha e-ba joalo.
You are not thinking well.	Ha o nahane hantle.
Everything we could not do.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe eo re neng re sa khone ho e etsa.
However, the picture.	Leha ho le joalo, setšoantšo.
There is no other way to look at it.	Ha ho mokhoa o mong oa ho e sheba.
Can you help?	O ka thusa?
I think they have to make their money in some way.	Ke nahana hore ba tlameha ho etsa chelete ea bona ka tsela e itseng.
I asked him how much he wanted.	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na o batla chelete e kae.
But we did not.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra etsa joalo.
You are not at fault.	Ha o na phoso.
This applies to both.	Sena se sebetsa ka bobeli.
We just love what we know.	Re rata feela seo re se tsebang.
She was really fun.	O ne a hlile a le monate.
I do not know how to reach them.	Ha ke tsebe mokhoa oa ho li fihlela.
We haven't seen you in a long time.	Ke khale re sa u bone.
Time seems to pass quickly.	Nako e bonahala e feta kapele.
All the other kids loved it.	Bana ba bang kaofela ba ne ba e rata haholo.
No one was afraid of him.	Ha ho motho leha a ne a mo tšaba.
I mean they are, but it is my business.	Ke bolela hore li teng, empa ke taba ea ka.
But how could he get back?	Empa o ne a ka fihla morao joang?
However, you have to eat this.	Leha ho le joalo, u tlameha ho ja sena.
Power belongs to him and only to him.	Matla ke a hae mme ke a hae feela.
Ask for help from here.	Kopa thuso ho tsoa mona.
It can be fun.	Ho ka ba monate.
He was really here.	O ne a hlile a le teng mona.
Probably nothing like that happened.	Mohlomong ha hoa etsahala letho la mofuta oo.
His head was bad.	Hlooho ya hae e ne e le mpe.
Thank you, once, for sure.	Ke leboha, hang, ka 'nete.
This is my father's room.	Ena ke kamore ea ntate.
I could not cry.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho lla.
Who should know about him.	Ke mang ea lokelang ho tseba ka eena.
My father stood up.	Ntate o ile a ema.
But it was not a bad thing.	Empa e ne e se ntho e mpe.
Maybe there were others.	Mohlomong ho ne ho e-na le ba bang.
It's nice to see how many are needed.	Ho monate ho bona hore na ho hlokahala tse kae.
She pleaded with her husband and arrested him.	O ile a kopa monna oa hae ’me a mo tšoara.
This money last year	Chelete ena selemong se fetileng
He is not wrong.	Ha a phoso.
I had no idea telling him his story.	Ke ne ke se na taba ea ho mo bolella litaba tsa hae.
It would have been easier if they had been.	Ho ne ho tla ba bonolo haeba ba ne ba le joalo.
Do not use them all.	U se ke ua li sebelisa kaofela.
I did this to help my health.	Ke entse sena ho thusa bophelo ba ka.
That was my chance.	Oo e ne e le monyetla oa ka.
He continued.	O ile a tsoela pele.
These were dangerous times.	Tsena e ne e le linako tse kotsi.
Maybe I will.	Mohlomong ke tla etsa joalo.
So be it.	Ho be jwalo.
It wasn't very good.	E ne e se ntle haholo.
What do you think will happen next?	U nahana hore ho tla etsahala'ng ka mor'a moo?
A a.	A a.
We want to continue to see those things.	Re batla ho tsoela pele ho bona lintho tseo.
As long as he was happy.	Ha feela a ne a thabile.
It just so happens that it is not necessary.	Hoa etsahala hore seo ha se hlokahale.
He was the most dangerous.	O ne a le kotsi ka ho fetisisa.
From.	Ho tsoa ho.
When that happens, it happens.	Ha seo se etsahala, sea etsahala.
Sometimes we can hear them.	Ka linako tse ling re khona ho li utloa.
It works well.	E sebetsa hantle.
Of course, very interesting things.	Ka 'nete, lintho tse monate haholo.
However, here it is.	Leha ho le joalo, mona ke.
I had to give them something.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho ba fa ho hong.
This, or something similar, seems to be equally true mentally.	Sena, kapa ntho e 'ngoe e tšoanang, e bonahala e le 'nete ka ho lekana ka kelello.
He may not have time to speak.	A ka nna a se be le nako ya ho bua.
Expect to see others coming out soon.	Lebella ho bona ba bang ba tsoa haufinyane.
Yes, he is talking about a real issue.	E, o bua ka taba ea sebele.
I knew they would work well together.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ba tla sebetsa hantle hammoho.
I do both.	Ke etsa bobeli.
No one refused.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a e hana.
The party went on until late in the evening.	Mokete o ile oa kena ho fihlela mantsiboea.
This is no longer necessary.	Sena ha se sa hlokahala.
Life goes on, you know.	Bophelo bo ntse bo tsoela pele, ua tseba.
Or tomorrow night.	Kapa hosane bosiu.
It's not good or bad, it's just that.	Ha e ntle kapa e mpe, ho joalo feela.
I want to work with you.	Ke batla ho sebetsa le uena.
That's a good thing, 'he says.	Ke ntho e ntle,' o re.
Someone asked if we should do something about them.	Motho e mong o ile a botsa hore na re lokela ho etsa ho hong ka bona.
It's a great way to get to know people.	Ke mokhoa o motle oa ho tseba batho.
I need you now.	Ke u hloka hona joale.
They often pass by when they should pass.	Hangata ba feta ha ba lokela ho feta.
We are just buying time.	Re mpa re reka nako.
You can do that someday.	U ka etsa joalo ka letsatsi le leng.
I'm sure my mom will love it too.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore mme oa ka le eena o tla e rata.
He's going back for more.	O ntse a khutlela morao bakeng sa tse ling.
I did not need to read the whole book.	Ke ne ke sa hloke ho bala buka kaofela.
You have nothing.	Ha o na letho.
She was so beautiful.	O ne a le motle haholo.
There is something wrong.	Ho na le phoso moo.
But that is never enough.	Empa hoo ha ho mohla ho lekaneng.
He knew it, though, the first night.	O ne a e tseba, leha ho le joalo, bosiung ba pele.
I understand what happened there.	Ke utloisisa se etsahetseng moo.
They have nothing to do with anyone.	Ha ba na taba le mang.
However, that is not the reason.	Leha ho le joalo, ha se lebaka.
I want you to know something.	Ke batla hore o tsebe ho hong.
I still do not know.	Ke ntse ke sa tsebe.
He did not know what to do.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a ka etsa eng hape.
There is so much to do.	Ho na le tse ngata tse etsang.
Until, of course, it is not.	Ho fihlela, ha e le hantle, ha ho joalo.
Time would do what it did for people.	Nako e ne e tla etsa seo e se entseng ho batho.
This can be fun.	Sena se ka ba monate.
And it is harder than you would like it to be.	Mme ho thata ho feta kamoo o ka ratang hore e be kateng.
It is not just for the latter.	Ha se bakeng sa morao feela.
Your feedback is important.	Maikutlo a hau a bohlokoa.
Starting with the concept of reality.	Ho qala ka mohopolo oa 'nete.
It’s a weird weird thing.	Ke ntho e makatsang e makatsang.
It was indeed a day of feasting.	Ruri e ne e le letsatsi la mokete.
He works hard and takes care of us.	O sebetsa ka thata mme o a re hlokomela.
But it is dangerous.	Empa ho kotsi.
We have to stop.	Re tlameha ho ema.
Clearly, their way of doing things is important.	Ho hlakile hore mokhoa oa bona oa ho etsa lintho ke oa bohlokoa.
This method works better that way.	Mokhoa ona o sebetsa betere ka tsela eo.
Look at night life.	Sheba bophelo ba bosiu.
But you can't comment on it.	Empa u ke ke ua fana ka maikutlo a hae.
I still want.	Ke ntse ke batla.
That hurts.	Hoo ho bohloko.
Yes, you can.	E, u ka tla.
We are really very strong.	Re hlile re matla haholo.
And when you get out of here, go fast!	'Me ha u tloha mona, u tsamaee kapele!
I think people will see that.	Ke nahana hore batho ba tla bona seo.
They are very strong.	Ba matla haholo.
This is what we want to do.	Sena ke seo re batlang ho se etsa.
No thanks.	Che, kea leboha.
We have nothing of that.	Ha re na letho la seo.
Not everything will be very fun.	Ha se ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e tla ba monate haholo.
There are many good books there.	Ho na le libuka tse ngata tse ntle moo.
That has always been the case.	Seo esale se etsahala.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Empa ho bonahala ho se joalo.
It plays well here often.	E bapala hantle mona hangata.
Or rather, it all went on to happen.	Kapa ho e-na le hoo, tsohle li ile tsa tsoela pele ho etsahala.
That would probably be easier.	Seo mohlomong se ka ba bonolo.
I knew he would not stay until he was close.	Ke ne ke tseba hore a ke ke a lula ho fihlela a le haufi.
They needed food.	Ba ne ba hloka lijo.
They are human.	Ke batho.
He was strong, handsome, and handsome.	O ne a le matla, a le monna a bile a le motle.
Use one or the other.	Sebelisa e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe.
Everyone went home.	E mong le e mong a khutlela hae.
I am asking for money for food.	Ke kopa chelete ea lijo.
Nothing ever worked.	Ha ho letho le kileng la sebetsa.
I thought you were the only one.	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke uena feela.
This is the way.	Ena ke tsela.
They told me that everything looked good.	Ba ile ba mpolella hore ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe e shebahala hantle.
Which.	E leng.
Someone knows everything about us.	Ho na le motho ea tsebang tsohle ka rona.
What time is it? 	Ke nako mang?
.	.
Yes, they can.	E, ba ka khona.
You know what you have.	O tseba seo o nang le sona.
Children will be children.	Bana e tla ba bana.
The last one continues to work today.	Ea ho qetela e tsoela pele ho sebetsa kajeno.
I went into my bedroom.	Ke ile ka kena ka kamoreng ea ka ea ho robala.
I could not sleep.	Ke ile ka sitoa ho robala.
This would be my last job.	Ena e ne e tla ba mosebetsi oa ka oa ho qetela.
You do not know !.	Ha o tsebe!.
And that seems like a lot.	Mme seo se bonahala se le ngata.
Many times.	Linako tse ngata.
I want to be home again.	Ke batla ho ba hae hape.
It was a house.	E ne e le ntlo.
Other than that, it's very playful, really.	Ntle ho moo, ho bapala haholo, ka 'nete.
I know you can do this.	Kea tseba hore u ka etsa sena.
It does not matter.	Ha ho na taba.
He was very nice.	O ne a le monate haholo.
He had never seen anything like it before.	O ne a qala ho bona ntho e joalo.
Jwale.	Jwale.
Lack of opportunity.	Ho hloka monyetla.
We are certainly entering a new era.	Ka sebele re kena nakong e ncha.
I have not yet figured out how to do this.	Ha ke so fumane hore na nka etsa sena joang.
It seemed to be inhabited.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ho lula batho.
Maybe we should look for money somewhere.	Mohlomong re lokela ho batla chelete sebakeng se seng.
I thought the same thing.	Ke ile ka nahana ntho e tšoanang.
There is nothing they can do at this time.	Ha ho letho leo ba ka le etsang nakong ena.
Nothing that night.	Ho se letho bosiung boo.
He wanted to have a father.	O ne a batla ho ba le ntate.
I didn't even want to come here.	Ke ne ke sa batle le ho tla mona.
The family should take care of the family.	Lelapa le lokela ho hlokomela lelapa.
It really is your place.	Ehlile ke sebaka sa hau.
He was tough.	O ne a le thata.
It’s coming in, as the books do.	E ntse e kena, joalo ka ha libuka li etsa.
He never wanted anything else.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a batla letho le leng.
But we will continue.	Empa re tla tsoela pele.
But it would take time.	Empa ho ne ho tla nka nako.
Look, it doesn't matter.	Sheba, ha ho na taba.
Do not take them.	U se ke ua li nka.
You are the first person who wants to come here.	Ke uena motho oa pele ea batlang ho tla mona.
He could have refused.	O ne a ka hana.
Please sit down.	Ka kopo, lula fatše.
I called my mom, and told her everything.	Ke ile ka letsetsa ’Mè, ’me ka mo bolella ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe.
It hurts so much to speak.	Ho bohloko haholo ho bua.
You do not want to talk.	Ha o batle ho bua.
I have to tell you the truth.	Ke tlameha ho bua 'nete ho uena.
He likes to play.	O rata ho bapala.
I can't sit still.	Ha ke khone ho lula.
That was definitely something he could do.	Ruri eo e ne e le ntho eo a neng a ka e etsa.
There is no reason at all it is empty.	Ha ho na lebaka ho hang ha e na letho.
We would love to know what makes you special.	Re rata ho tseba hore na ke eng e etsang hore u be oa bohlokoa.
In the end it is important.	Qetellong ke bohlokoa.
Do not ask such questions.	U se ke ua botsa lipotso tse joalo.
They want to know what to do.	Ba batla ho tseba seo ba lokelang ho se etsa.
This is also true this year.	Sena ke 'nete hape selemong sena.
We are in a difficult place.	Re sebakeng se thata.
I know a lot about you.	Ke tseba haholo ka wena.
No one knew who he was at the time.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tseba hore na ke mang ka nako eo.
I stayed alone.	Ke ile ka lula ke le mong.
They needed him.	Ba ne ba mo hloka.
We could not believe it.	Ha rea ​​ka ra lumela.
I think there is one nearby.	Ke nahana hore ho na le e 'ngoe haufi le mona.
But he refused to tell us.	Empa o ile a hana ho re bolella.
I'm glad to see what everyone has to say about it.	Ke thabela ho bona seo bohle ba se buang ka eona.
It took time to get a new car.	Ho ile ha nka nako ho fumana koloi e ncha.
So, you see, now is your chance.	Ka hona, ua bona, joale ke monyetla oa hau.
We cannot fix everything.	Re ke ke ra lokisa lintho tsohle.
Except for my parents.	Ntle ho batsoali ba ka.
I'm not usually around.	Hangata ha ke 'na ha u le haufi.
The truth is what it is.	'Nete ke seo e leng sona.
But they are human.	Empa ke batho.
Consider what happened.	Nahana ka se ileng sa etsahala.
I had no idea he was there.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore o teng.
mora.	mora.
He says no.	O re che.
Maybe some people would like.	Mohlomong batho ba bang ba ka rata.
It should be one week.	E lokela ho ba beke e le 'ngoe.
They have been living there ever since.	Haesale ba lula moo.
But thankfully, they are as good as new.	Empa kea leboha, li ntle joalo ka ha li ncha.
Good for him.	Molemo ho eena.
It was easy.	E ne e le bonolo.
Who is it? 	Ke mang?
he asked.	a botsa.
Yes, that applies to you too.	E, hoo ho sebetsa le ho uena.
You were not.	U ne u se joalo.
We did not understand this.	Re ne re sa utloisise sena.
All were arrested.	Tsohle li ile tsa tšoaroa.
Just go home.	Khutlela hae feela.
It would have been strange if he had not done so.	E ka be e bile ntho e makatsang hoja a ne a sa ka a etsa joalo.
He would have liked to have asked her a few things.	A ka be a ile a rata ho mo botsa lintho tse seng kae.
To work and to be one.	Ho sebetsa le ho ba ntho e le 'ngoe.
Many do not get that.	Ba bangata ha ba fumane seo.
We need to have it.	Re hloka ho ba le eona.
It was the same with the old and the new.	Ho ne ho le joalo le ka tsa khale le ka tse ncha.
He could not tell me why.	O ne a ke ke a mpolella lebaka.
We are very happy.	Re thabile haholo.
That's a lot of money.	Ke chelete e ngata.
Stand with us.	Ema le rona.
Like, just weird stuff.	Joalo ka, lintho tse makatsang feela.
You should read as many books as you can.	U lokela ho bala libuka tse ngata kamoo u ka khonang.
You work harder than you think.	O sebetsa ho feta kamoo o nahanang.
This place was fun.	Sebaka sena se ne se le monate.
And it's hard.	Mme ho thata.
Maybe he made a mistake and made a mistake.	Mohlomong o entse phoso mme a etsa phoso.
How long.	Ke nako e kae.
This is how it should be.	Sena ke kamoo se lokelang ho ba kateng.
But he left.	Empa o ile a tsamaea.
You know what.	Ua tseba hore na.
It starts with just knowing.	E qala ka ho tseba feela.
There was none.	Ho ne ho se na.
We have no one here.	Ha re na motho mona.
You want a better future.	U batla mofuta o betere nakong e tlang.
Think about it for sure.	Nahana ka eona ruri.
The floor is useless at all.	E fatše ha e na thuso ho hang.
I still have them.	Ke ntse ke na le tsona.
There was nothing that anyone could do at the time.	Ho ne ho se letho leo motho a ka le etsang ka nako eo.
You will see, you will see.	O tla bona, o tla bona.
Instead, say something like, it's a difficult question.	Ho e-na le hoo, bua ntho e kang, ke potso e thata.
Finally he sat down enough to sit down.	Qetellong o ile a lula fatše ho lekana hore a ka lula fatše.
Travel was good.	Ho tsamaea ho ne ho le molemo.
That was not the case.	E ne e se eona taba eo.
They were expecting some kind.	Ba ne ba lebeletse mofuta o itseng.
I want to win.	Ke batla ho hlola.
They were waiting for him.	Ba ne ba mo emetse.
So it is better.	Kahoo ho molemo.
But it did not come.	Empa ha ea ka ea tla.
That's the point here.	Ke eona taba mona.
No one has ever looked like that.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a shebahala joalo.
And he refused to meet me.	Mme a hana ho kopana le nna.
We have nowhere near that place.	Ha re na moo re leng teng haufi le sebaka seo .
I'm not sure why.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na hobaneng.
It does not want to think.	Ha e batle ho nahana.
Will do.	Ke tla etsa joalo.
They loved to be able to walk to whatever they needed.	Ba ne ba rata ho khona ho tsamaea ho eng kapa eng eo ba e hlokang.
However, there was one thing he had to do first.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le ntho e le 'ngoe eo a neng a lokela ho e etsa pele.
But imagine what it will be like when we return home.	Empa nahana hore na ho tla ba joang ha re khutlela hae.
Best for you.	Molemo ka ho fetisisa ho uena.
I hope it was clear.	Ke tšepa hore e ne e hlakile.
It's dangerous.	Ke kotsi.
The handsome boy is very handsome.	Moshanyana e motle o motle haholo.
He just went on with it.	O ile a tsoela pele ka eona feela.
Also, it is not necessary.	Hape, ha ho hlokahale.
I asked him about this day.	Ke ile ka mo botsa ka letsatsi le.
These are just some of the questions you need to ask yourself.	Ke lipotso feela tseo u lokelang ho ipotsa tsona, hape.
If you have it, this is the time to use it.	Haeba u na le eona, ena ke nako ea ho e sebelisa.
Her husband knew nothing.	Monna oa hae o ne a sa tsebe letho.
I was just saying.	Ke ne ke bolela feela.
He seemed speechless.	O ne a bonahala a sa khone ho bua.
Feel the power !.	Utloa matla!.
I just finished my degree.	Ke sa tsoa qeta lengolo la ka.
Maybe it's connected with something else, but it's hard to say.	Mohlomong e kopane le ntho e 'ngoe, empa ho thata ho bolela eng.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
But if you love someone, it can be hard to do this.	Empa ha u rata motho, ho ka ba thata ho etsa sena.
I don't care what you think.	Ha ke tsotelle maikutlo a hau.
He knows that they will not be able to find him.	Oa tseba hore ha ba na ho qeta nako e telele ba mo batla.
My pain is my pain.	Bohloko ba ka ke bohloko ba ka.
That meant.	Ho neng ho bolela.
Just ask right.	Botsa hantle feela.
We love him here.	Re mo rata mona.
Think about what your day looks like.	Nahana hore na letsatsi la hau le shebahala joang.
Very good.	E ntle haholo.
I think that's the problem.	Ke nahana hore bothata ke bona.
Always tell your doctor exactly how you feel.	Kamehla bolella ngaka ea hau hantle hore na u ikutloa joang.
His books were always up-to-date.	Libuka tsa hae li ne li lula li le nakong.
I'm not sure it will come.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore e tla tla.
It worked, but it was not a good thing.	E ile ea sebetsa, empa e ne e se ntho e ntle.
But it is not yours.	Empa ha se oa hao.
Very early to read.	Esale pele haholo ho bala.
Guess what.	Nahana feela.
The day is simple.	Letsatsi le bonolo.
It didn’t matter to me.	E ne e se ea bohlokoa ho 'na.
I knew that would pass.	Ke ne ke tseba hore seo se tla feta.
Maybe this was a mistake.	Mohlomong ena e ne e le phoso.
We will never know.	Re ke ke ra tseba.
It certainly paid off.	Ka sebele e ile ea lefa.
Some days are better than others.	Matsatsi a mang a molemo ho feta a mang.
No problem.	Ha ho bothata.
People were eating.	Batho ba ne ba ja.
Newcomers are illiterate.	Batho ba sa tsoa fihla ha ba tsebe ho bala le ho ngola.
But the process was simple.	Empa mokhoa ona o ne o le bonolo.
Love someone.	Rata motho e mong.
He is very much here.	O mona haholo.
You will see them here.	U tla li bona mona.
I can stay with them.	Nka lula le bona.
His job must be very difficult.	Mosebetsi oa hae o tlameha ho ba boima haholo.
He tried to call.	A leka ho letsa.
It was the first time I had seen him.	Ke ne ke qala ho mo bona.
I didn't care.	Ke ne ke se na taba.
They were right.	Ba ne ba bolela hantle.
It's still beautiful.	E ntse e le ntle.
We did not expect to find it for anything like that.	Re ne re sa lebella ho e fumana bakeng sa ntho leha e le efe e joalo.
We may not know.	Re ka 'na ra se ke ra tseba.
I know what it did for me and my family.	Ke tseba seo e se entseng ho nna le ho ba lelapa la ka.
He doesn't care.	Ha a tsotelle letho.
When it reached the ground, a man passed by.	Ha e fihla fatše, monna e mong a feta.
Like something else.	Joalo ka ntho e 'ngoe.
He did so reluctantly.	O ile a etsa joalo a sa rate.
This is where the real problem comes in.	Mona ke moo bothata ba sebele bo tlang teng.
If so, so be it.	Haeba ho joalo, ho be joalo.
I'll see you next time.	Ke tla u bona nakong e tlang.
It still doesn't help.	E ntse e sa thusa.
At home we do not do that.	Ha re le hae ha re etse joalo.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Ke nako e sa le teng ho bua ka maikutlo a hau.
He had never seen anything like it before.	O ne a e-s’o bone ntho e joalo.
Your life is not in danger.	Bophelo ba hau ha bo kotsing.
Whether they would believe it or not is true.	Hore na ba ne ba tla lumela kapa che ke 'nete.
I took care of it all.	Ke ile ka e hlokomela kaofela.
It cries a lot.	Hoa lla haholo.
Sometimes we want to look back and move forward.	Ka linako tse ling re batla ho batla morao le ho ea pele.
I did this.	Ke entse sena.
Call, continue, continue calling.	Letsa, tsoela pele, tsoela pele ho letsa.
The error should not continue.	Phoso ha ea lokela ho tsoela pele.
You can do it yourself.	U ka e etsa le uena.
We are thinking of doing it.	Re nahana ho e etsa.
I found it again.	Ke ile ka e fumana hape.
We were stronger, and we could feel it.	Re ne re le matla ho feta, ’me re ne re khona ho e utloa.
I thought of my children.	Ke ile ka nahana ka bana ba ka.
I was not eating.	Ke ne ke sa je.
And it is obviously not very fun.	'Me ho hlakile hore ha e monate haholo.
Boy's room, of course.	Kamore ea moshanyana, ka 'nete.
How can you know this?	U ka tseba see joang?
But he no longer cared.	Empa o ne a se a sa tsotelle.
Something he was just beginning to see.	Ntho eo a neng a qala ho e bona.
Maybe he can have it too.	Mohlomong le eena a ka ba le eona.
She was beautiful.	O ne a le motle.
At one point they did not look at them.	Ka lekhetlo le leng ha baa ka ba sheba ho bona.
No, on it.	Che, ho eona.
I don’t think he can ever look at us the same way.	Ha ke nahane hore a ka hlola a re sheba ka tsela e tšoanang.
He did not stop.	Ha a ka a ema.
My baby is happy.	Ngoana oa ka o thabile.
Good news.	Litaba tse monate.
I was too tired to go home.	Ke ne ke khathetse haholo hore nka ea hae.
He would come and give her a dog.	O ne a tla tla ho mo fa ntja.
Indeed, this is true.	Ka sebele, sena ke ’nete.
I really like this place.	Ke rata sebaka sena haholo.
He was passing by his house.	O ne a feta ha hae.
It was very hard work.	E ne e le mosebetsi o boima haholo.
Everyone can see it.	Bohle ba ka e bona.
However, you can have one without the other.	Leha ho le joalo, u ka ba le e 'ngoe ntle le e' ngoe.
He was at home with them.	O ne a le hae le bona.
I decided to look for it.	Ke ile ka nahana ho e batla.
That's what it will look like.	Ke kamoo e tla shebahala kateng.
I had to study it on my own.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho ithuta eona ke le mong.
I don’t think anyone knew it existed.	Ha ke nahane hore ho na le motho ea neng a tseba hore e teng.
It goes very well for the big man.	E tsamaea hantle haholo bakeng sa monna e moholo.
So there it is.	Kahoo ho na le hoo.
He has felt his power.	O utloile matla a hae.
I'm better than you now.	Ke feta wena le jwale.
I hope you don't care.	Ke tšepa hore ha u tsotelle.
We did not pay for this.	Ha rea ​​lefa sena.
It would be so.	Ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
It is a dangerous job.	Ke mosebetsi o kotsi.
And here you are.	Mme ke lona bana.
Close to my family and friends.	Haufi le lelapa la ka le metsoalle.
More on that here.	Tse ling ka seo mona.
He too.	Le eena hape.
I do not want to talk to you.	Ha ke batle ho bua le wena.
Is it my money?	Ke chelete ea ka?
They are modern day and evening outfits.	Ke liaparo tsa kajeno tsa letsatsi le mantsiboea.
They may cry.	Ba ka ’na ba lla.
Yes, it is not just us.	E, ha se rona feela.
Moreover, he knew that it was true.	Ho feta moo, o ne a tseba hore ke ’nete.
I just couldn't.	Ke ne ke mpa ke sa khone.
Probably the first person since then.	Mohlomong ke motho oa pele ho tloha ka nako eo.
No, it is not.	Che, ha ho joalo.
''.	''.
I don't like it very much.	Ha ke e rate hakaalo.
We can hope that they will.	Re ka tšepa hore ba tla etsa joalo.
He was not an expert.	E ne e se setsebi.
At your request !.	Ka kopo ea hau!.
No one will be with us long enough.	Ha ho motho ea tla ba le rona nako e telele e lekaneng.
I just live here.	Ke lula mona feela.
You are bigger than you think.	O moholo ho feta kamoo o nahanang.
I have to say something to her.	Ke lokela ho bua ho hong ho eena.
Well, until.	Hantle, ho fihlela.
But they did not go.	Empa ha baa ka ba tsamaea.
None of us felt the need to talk.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea ileng a utloa ho hlokahala hore a bue.
However, it had taken him three days.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho mo nkile matsatsi a mararo.
We have nothing to do with you.	Ha re na letho ho uena.
It was fun to do.	Ho ne ho le monate ho etsa.
Until then, while they are waiting.	Ho fihlela ka nako eo, ha ba ntse ba emetse.
To us, we do not believe any of those things.	Ho rona, ha re lumele le e 'ngoe ea lintho tseo.
Bad things are happening here.	Ho etsahala lintho tse mpe mona.
We no longer need him.	Ha re sa mo hloka.
Is that your car?	Na ke koloi ea hau eo?
I want this way.	Ke batla tsela ena.
We have such an amazing team.	Re na le sehlopha se makatsang joalo.
There seems to be something wrong with this place.	Ho bonahala ho na le ntho e itseng ka sebaka sena.
It was a weird thing to do.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang ho e etsa.
However it was not.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e se joalo.
We will never learn his story.	Ho hang re ke ke ra ithuta litaba tsa hae.
If anything happens.	Haeba ho etsahala letho.
The road seemed empty.	Tsela e ne e bonahala e se na letho.
However, they want to.	Leha ho le joalo, ba batla.
That is why,	Ke ka hona,
So shall we go on?	Joale na re tla tsoela pele?
Not anymore.	Ha ho sa le joalo.
It could be us.	E ka ba rona.
It is easy to say, but even more difficult to do.	Ho bonolo ho e bua, empa ho thata le ho feta ho e etsa.
He can tell me.	A ka mpolella.
We could do it even by phone.	Re ne re ka e etsa le ka mohala.
He was tired, so he slept.	O ne a khathetse, kahoo a robala.
It had its time and place.	E ne e e-na le nako le sebaka sa eona.
People feel like they can touch my stomach.	Batho ba utloa eka ba ka tšoara mpa ea ka.
I just want to understand you.	Ke batla ho u utloisisa feela.
Yes, this is difficult.	E, sena se thata.
It's in our room at night.	E ka kamoreng ea rona bosiu.
Maybe he is.	Mohlomong o teng.
He was a strong man.	E ne e le monna ya matla.
However, it is important to talk about these issues.	Leha ho le joalo, ho bohlokoa ho bua ka litaba tsena.
When you say something bad, you think it is a good thing.	Ha u re ntho e mpe, u nka hore ntho e ntle.
They wanted nothing.	Ba ne ba sa batle letho.
You need to do this.	U lokela ho etsa sena.
Although it will help you a little.	Leha e tla o thusa hanyane.
Then comes a strange thing.	Joale ho tla ntho e makatsang.
They never got it.	Ba ne ba so ka ba e fumana.
Everything seems to be working fine.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e bonahala e sebetsa hantle.
He did not like that at all.	O ne a sa rate seo ho hang.
He wants to learn.	O batla ho ithuta.
Search.	Batlang.
I don't even know his second name.	Ha ke tsebe le lebitso la hae la bobeli.
He declined to comment on the matter.	O ile a hana ho bua ka taba ea hae.
Obviously, this was not his room.	Ho hlakile hore ena e ne e se kamore ea hae.
He says he can help find that person.	O re a ka thusa ho fumana motho eo.
He never thought he could give money.	O ne a e-s'o nahane hore a ka fana ka chelete.
I am not in the legal profession.	Ha ke mosebetsing oa molao.
But somehow he could not speak.	Empa ka tsela e itseng o ne a sa khone ho bua.
Continue to help her.	Tsoela pele ho mo thusa.
They work every day.	Ba sebetsa letsatsi le letsatsi.
Probably so, but no one will ever know.	Mohlomong ho joalo, empa ha ho motho ea tla tseba.
As they say, who knows?	Joalo ka ha ba re, ke mang ea tsebang?
He would save them.	O ne a tla ba boloka.
He was leaving.	O ne a tsamaea.
We were very happy.	Re ne re thabile haholo.
I don’t even think about going back.	Ke sa nahane le ho khutlela morao.
It was pretty good.	E ne e le ntle hantle.
That's what every woman thinks.	Ke seo mosali e mong le e mong a se nahanang.
He left immediately after breakfast.	O ile a tloha hang ka mor'a lijo tsa hoseng.
Note how long it takes.	Hlokomela hore na ke nako e kae.
It certainly did that for me.	Ka sebele e entse joalo bakeng sa ka.
Hard work, it may be, but it is too late.	Ho sebetsa ka thata, ho ka ba joalo, empa ke morao haholo.
They were here for something.	Ba ne ba le mona bakeng sa ho hong.
They want theirs.	Ba batla tsa bona.
Not that there is anything wrong with this.	Ha se hore ho na le phoso ka sena.
But it wasn't me.	Empa e ne e se nna.
And it wasn’t because of the need to try.	'Me e ne e se ka lebaka la ho hloka ho leka.
One year there was a cry.	Selemong se seng ho bile ho lla.
You don't want a man.	Ha o batle monna.
Not making friends.	Ho se etse metsoalle.
Going forward, you need to get better.	Ho ea pele, o hloka ho ba betere.
It was still beautiful.	E ne e ntse e le ntle.
He did not get it.	Ha a ka a e fumana.
No, it is true.	Che, ke 'nete.
Everyone does that.	Motho e mong le e mong o etsa joalo.
But the time comes when you are still a teenager.	Empa nako ea fihla ha u sa le mohlankana.
It could be something else.	E ka ba ntho e 'ngoe hape.
No, he could not.	Che, o ne a ke ke a khona.
We go back.	Re khutlela morao.
They are real.	Ke ba sebele.
That to me was fun.	Ho nna hoo ho ne ho le monate.
They loved it.	Ba ne ba e rata.
It was just like that.	Ho ne ho le jwalo feela.
I just thought of something.	Ke ile ka nahana feela ka ntho e itseng.
They started spending time together.	Ba ile ba qala ho qeta nako hammoho.
There are no problems with this.	Ha ho na mathata ka sena.
It was a way to do it.	E ne e le mokhoa oa ho e etsa.
I have to do it.	Ke tlameha ho e etsa.
When that happens it will not be so much fun.	Ha seo se etsahala ho ke ke ha e-ba monate haholo.
Someone is crying, others are thinking and learning.	Motho e mong oa lla, ba bang ba nahana le ho ithuta.
This is a bad thing.	Taba ena e mpe.
I really don't.	Ha ke hlile ha ke joalo.
Mine came to me that way.	Ea ka e ile ea tla ho 'na ka tsela eo.
This is how you do it.	Ena ke tsela eo u e etsang ka eona.
We had a great time.	Re bile le nako e monate.
It may take days.	E ka nka matsatsi.
It had to be a dog.	E ne e tlameha ho ba ntja.
Maybe you're really busy.	Mohlomong u hlile u phathahane.
And a lot of money.	Le chelete e ngata.
The work was hard.	Mosebetsi o ne o le boima.
But we continue to do so.	Empa re tsoela pele ho etsa joalo.
I was not enough.	Ke ne ke sa lekana.
They could not have survived without each other.	Ho hang ba ne ba ke ke ba phela ntle ho e mong.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ke ngoanana e motle.
Today we did that.	Kajeno re entse joalo.
It can take a long time to get back.	Ho ka nka nako e telele ho khutlela morao.
No, this is not your place.	Che, sena ha se sebaka sa hau.
I don't think you should be.	Ha ke nahane hore o lokela ho ba jwalo.
Watch this carefully!	Sheba sena ka hloko!
Tell us what you know.	Re bolelle seo u se tsebang.
Another found him innocent.	E mong o ile a mo fumana a se na molato.
It feels like a place of power.	E ikutloa joaloka sebaka sa matla.
That works very well, too.	Seo se sebetsa hantle haholo, hape.
I work on my day job.	Ke sebetsa mosebetsing oa ka oa letsatsi.
There were some strange things in this place.	Ho ne ho e-na le lintho tse makatsang sebakeng sena.
What could be better?	Ke eng e ka bang betere?
You have an important job to do.	U na le mosebetsi oa bohlokoa oo u lokelang ho o etsa.
Things are very bad.	Lintho li mpe haholo.
Have a good night.	Eba le bosiu bo monate.
Even more dangerous.	Le ho feta kotsi.
Water had not been available for years.	Metsi a ne a e-s'o be teng ka lilemo tse ngata.
I will always try not to try.	Ke tla lula ke leka hore ke se ke ka leka.
Friends are very close.	Metsoalle e haufi haholo.
I didn't want it.	Ke ne ke sa e batla.
But he did not know why.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe lebaka.
It's a wonderful feeling, to know you're behind me.	Ke maikutlo a monate, ho tseba hore o ka morao ho nna.
Thank you very much.	Ke leboha haholo.
Anything they could.	Eng kapa eng eo ba neng ba ka khona.
He understood how difficult that decision was.	O ne a utloisisa hore na qeto eo e ne e le boima hakae.
You are going to love it.	O ya e rata.
That is your decision.	Eo ke qeto ea hao.
They needed money.	Ba ne ba hloka chelete.
There he is, he speaks softly.	Ke eo, a bua ka bonolo.
I don't know if that's the reason for this.	Ha ke tsebe haeba ke lona lebaka la sena.
The party was fun.	Mokete o ne o le monate.
I really enjoyed it today.	Ke e thabetse haholo kajeno.
She is your teacher.	Ke tichere ea hao.
They wanted to read about their group.	Ba ne ba batla ho bala ka sehlopha sa bona.
He had to take her.	O ile a tlameha ho mo nka.
You can't take him.	O ka se mo nke.
He came to stay with us.	O ile a tla ho lula le rona.
There was no more shame now.	Ho ne ho se na lihlong le ho feta joale.
There seemed to be nothing.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se letho.
They would be busy.	Ba ne ba tla be ba phathahane.
They were detained for many years.	Ba ile ba tšoaroa ka lilemo tse ngata.
I only looked at it once.	Ke ile ka e sheba hang feela.
He wants to talk.	O batla ho bua.
You write the book you want to read.	U ngola buka eo u batlang ho e bala.
Some people were not.	Batho ba bang ba ne ba se joalo.
Get out while you can.	Tsoa ha u ntse u khona.
This seems to be very good for you.	Sena se bonahala se le molemo haholo ho uena.
It's just so beautiful.	E ntle haholo feela.
They had not yet eaten their supper.	Ba ne ba eso je lijo tsa bona tsa mantsiboea.
Our job is to help you stay that way.	Mosebetsi oa rona ke ho u thusa hore u lule u le joalo.
Of course it did.	Ehlile ho bile joalo.
He wants her to know that he loves her.	O batla hore a tsebe hore oa mo rata.
I can't see the man.	Ha ke bone monna eo.
We can do this.	Re ka etsa sena.
Well, of course, this is not what happens.	Ha e le hantle, ha e le hantle, sena ha se se etsahalang.
Every morning go to work.	Hoseng ho hong le ho hong ho ea mosebetsing.
Yet it starts later.	Leha ho le joalo e qala ka morao.
I just got back from him.	Ke sa tsoa khutla ho eena.
You know it's my favorite day of the year.	O a tseba hore ke letsatsi leo ke le ratang ka ho fetisisa selemong.
We could not write them otherwise.	Re ne re ke ke ra li ngola ho seng joalo.
But still.	Empa leha ho le joalo.
Of course, this has even happened in the past.	Ka sebele, sena se bile sa etsahala le nakong e fetileng.
I have my job at the time.	Ke na le mosebetsi oa ka ka nako eo.
Everything has its time.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e na le nako ea eona.
By this time we were close to the car.	Ka nako ena re ne re se re le haufi le koloi.
Then proceed to do it.	Ebe u tsoela pele ho e etsa.
But you can't sit back.	Empa u ke ke ua lula morao.
Then they will let you go.	Joale ba tla u tlohela.
But, this is just a thought.	Empa, ona ke mohopolo feela.
Walk carefully.	Tsamaea ka hloko.
That’s exactly what we all do.	Ke hantle seo bohle re se etsang.
And we knew nothing.	Mme re ne re sa tsebe letho.
You always wish there could be someone else.	U lula u lakatsa eka ho ka ba le e mong hape.
Very good food, and very tasty.	Lijo tse ntle haholo, le tse monate haholo.
He often helped the children.	Hangata o ne a thusa bana.
The food here is delicious.	Lijo tse mona li monate.
I did not want to stay.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho lula.
We can stop and walk.	Re ka ema ra tsamaea.
Then he would move on with his life.	Joale o ne a tla tsoela pele ka bophelo ba hae.
If you wanted to get out.	Haeba u ne u batla ho tsoa.
That is a powerful way to start.	Eo ke tsela e matla ea ho qala.
It was easy, really.	E ne e le bonolo, ruri.
Then she told her father she wanted it.	Eaba o bolella ntate oa hae hore o batla eona.
You ask questions or comments.	U botsa lipotso kapa maikutlo.
But it was not that easy.	Empa ho ne ho se bonolo hakaalo.
I can no longer speak.	Ha ke sa khona ho bua.
I work very well.	Ke sebetsa hantle haholo.
It can speak now.	E ka bua hona joale.
There was one first.	Ho ne ho e-na le e mong oa pele.
I would not suggest that there is anything wrong with any child.	Ke ne nke ke ka fana ka maikutlo a hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso ka ngoana leha e le ofe.
No, you need someone there, don't you.	Che, u hloka motho moo, ha ho joalo.
Please try to do the same.	Ka kopo, leka ho etsa se tšoanang.
I like what you are saying.	Ke rata seo u se buang.
You can go anywhere.	O ka ya kae kapa kae.
Then he returned.	Eaba oa khutla.
Then I gave him some food.	Eaba ke mo fa lijo.
That made her think.	Seo se ile sa mo fa mohopolo.
I will not be.	Nke ke ka ba.
But he did nothing.	Empa o ne a sa etsa letho.
Like working.	Joalo ka ho sebetsa.
You look nice.	O shebahala hantle.
But none of this is enough.	Empa ha ho letho la sena le lekaneng.
And there are others.	Mme ho na le ba bang.
It's time to start talking.	Ke nako ea pele ho bua.
They were doing it.	Ba ne ba ntse ba e etsa.
I did not see it.	Ha kea ka ka e bona.
But then that was not the case.	Empa joale ho ne ho se joalo.
That is not the case.	Ha ho joalo.
We would both do the same.	Ka bobeli re ne re tla etsa joalo.
And her husband.	Le monna oa hae.
That child is telling the truth.	Ngoana eo o bua ’nete.
We must .	Re tlameha .
This should not have happened.	Sena se ne se sa lokela ho etsahala.
Now that's a very good thing!	Joale ke ntho e ntle haholo!
I want to be a teacher.	Ke batla ho ba tichere.
It was so.	Ho bile jwalo.
I start talking but I start to cry.	Ke qala ho bua empa ke qala ho lla.
What was the real thing? 	Ntho ea sebele e ne e le efe?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
Never come here again.	Se ke oa hlola u tla mona.
Of course, he realized.	Ehlile, o ile a hlokomela.
He was clear.	O ne a hlakile.
I walk outside.	Ke tsamaea ka ntle.
It is still very bad.	Ho ntse ho le mpe haholo.
If we are caught we will not be able to live on the ground.	Haeba re ka tšoaroa re ke ke ra khona ho phela fatše.
Wanting the same.	Ho batla se tšoanang.
I just wanted to stand outside.	Ke ne ke batla ho ema ka ntle feela.
Better than nothing.	E molemo ho feta letho.
This would work or it would not work.	Sena se ne se tla sebetsa kapa se ne se ke ke sa sebetsa.
He comes a little every day.	O tla hanyane letsatsi le letsatsi.
However, that is probably not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, mohlomong ha se lebaka.
Only a child.	Ngoana feela.
People often have difficulty understanding what he is saying.	Hangata batho ba na le bothata ba ho utloisisa seo a se buang.
That's my subject, now.	Eo ke taba ea ka, joale.
It is an important issue.	Ke taba ea bohlokoa.
He's seen it happen before.	O e bone e etsahala pele.
She and her husband do not go to that place very much.	Eena le monna oa hae ha ba ee sebakeng seo hakaalo.
He needs it.	O a e hloka.
Back to school.	Khutlela sekolong.
Such sad news, but.	Litaba tse bohloko joalo, empa .
True.	'Nete.
However, nothing happened.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala.
She did not understand that he loved her.	O ne a sa utloisise hore oa mo rata.
I do not understand why.	Ha ke utloisise lebaka.
You can't.	U ka se khone.
And it's not good.	Mme ha e ntle.
However, it was more than that.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho feta moo.
Then he left.	Joale o ne a tsamaea.
Everyone does it.	E mong le e mong oa e etsa.
And family life is very difficult in this profession.	’Me bophelo ba lelapa bo thata haholo mosebetsing ona.
None of them will make it go.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona e tla etsa hore e tsamaee.
You can use one or the other.	U ka sebelisa e 'ngoe kapa e' ngoe.
You said this is no longer enough for you.	U itse sena ha se sa u lekana.
They swam for about three hours.	Ba ile ba sesa lihora tse ka bang tharo.
They just decide that this is not good.	Ba mpa ba etsa qeto ea hore sena ha se ntle.
He decided to try his return.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho leka ho khutlela ha hae.
They use it for their child.	Ba e sebelisa bakeng sa ngoana oa bona.
You certainly have plenty of space.	Ka sebele u na le sebaka se ngata.
This did not do so.	Sena ha sea ka sa etsa joalo.
I hope someone will fix this problem.	Ke tšepa hore motho o tla lokisa bothata bona.
He is a bad dog.	Ke ntja e mpe.
They did not understand him.	Ba ne ba sa mo utloisise.
Write down your thoughts as you work.	Ngola maikutlo a hau ha u ntse u sebetsa.
He did not tell me what it was.	Ha a ka a mpolella hore na ke eng.
But this was more than many others.	Empa sena se ne se feta tse ling tse ngata.
That's what he is.	Ke seo a leng sona.
I have loved him for many years.	Ke na le lilemo tse ngata ke mo rata.
Then he found out.	Eaba o fumana.
He really loves her.	Ehlile oa mo rata.
It is an important task.	Ke mosebetsi oa bohlokoa.
We have all the help we need.	Re fumane thuso eohle eo re e hlokang.
Of course, everyone wants to be a doctor.	Ke ’nete hore e mong le e mong o batla ho ba ngaka.
I come in and it's you.	Ke kena 'me ke uena.
However, it is never the first.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho mohla ea pele.
You should start now.	U lokela ho qala hona joale.
They were bad.	Ba ne ba le mpe.
He needs to speak.	O hloka ho bua.
However, there was a mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho e-na le phoso.
I like to spend a lot of time with my kids.	Ke rata ho qeta nako e ngata le bana ba ka.
I'm sorry how hard it was.	Ke masoabi hore na ho bile thata hakae.
He did not do so well.	Ha a ka a etsa mosebetsi o motle hakaalo.
Perhaps you can imagine the condition of your feet.	Mohlomong u ka nahana ka boemo ba maoto a hau.
You will have to decide which one of them does it.	U tla lokela ho etsa qeto ea hore na ke efe ho bona e etsang.
It will be difficult to get back here.	Ho tla ba thata ho khutla mona.
There was a group of people.	Ho ne ho e-na le sehlopha sa batho.
They had heard of him, of course.	Ba ne ba utloile ka eena, ho hlakile.
It blends very well.	E kopane hantle haholo.
All there is to feeling.	Sohle se teng ke maikutlo.
He certainly knew more than that.	Ruri o ne a tseba ho feta moo.
I did not understand.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise.
I began to think about moving on.	Ke ile ka qala ho nahana ho tsoela pele.
He asked where else.	O ile a botsa hore na kae hape.
They could not leave.	Ba ne ba ke ke ba tloha.
The fact is that no one knows where it came from.	'Nete ke hore ha ho motho ea tsebang hore na e tsoa hokae.
He likes to know.	O rata ho tseba.
But still,.	Empa leha ho le joalo,.
It was just too dangerous.	E ne e mpa e le kotsi haholo.
There was not enough food, not enough water.	Ho ne ho se lijo tse lekaneng, ho se metsi a lekaneng.
I felt embarrassed.	Ke ile ka ikutloa ke le lihlong.
I was a woman.	Ke ne ke le mosali.
There is a situation that one should not go through.	Ho na le boemo boo motho a sa lokelang ho feta ho bona.
And many more.	Le tse ling tse ngata.
I often think of him.	Hangata ke nahana ka eena.
There is nothing there.	Haho letho moo.
There can be only one.	Ho ka ba le a le mong feela.
There is no room for doubt.	Ha ho sebaka sa ho belaela.
I will go and talk to him.	Ke tla ea ho bua le eena.
I love life.	Ke rata bophelo.
Exactly what this is all about.	Ke hantle hore na sena se bua ka eng.
We do not.	Ha re .
Do not swim here.	O seke wa sesa mona.
Here, there was only one.	Mona, ho ne ho e-na le a le mong feela.
They really want to be kids.	Ba hlile ba batla ho ba bana.
Only time will tell!	Ke nako feela e tla bolela!.
I did not want to hear it.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho e utloa.
They were the worst.	E ne e le tsona tse mpe ka ho fetisisa.
It played just as well as everyone expected.	E ile ea bapala hantle kamoo bohle ba neng ba e lebeletse kateng.
It happens every day.	Ho etsahala letsatsi le letsatsi.
Because you will have.	Hobane u tla ba le.
This would not be an easy task.	Ena e ne e ke ke ea e-ba taba e bonolo.
But we could not do it.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra khona ho e etsa.
They are no longer working.	Ha ba sa sebetsa.
You get that.	O fumana seo.
Children will be children.	Bana e tla ba bana.
He really didn't care.	O ne a hlile a sa tsotelle letho.
Not true.	Ha se 'nete.
That would not be fun.	Seo se ka se be monate.
We could not have done this without him.	Re ne re ke ke ra etsa sena ntle le eena.
By then they already had a lot of money.	Ka nako eo ba ne ba se ba e-na le chelete e ngata.
Wait a minute.	Ema hanyane.
He never needed a car.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a hloka koloi.
It was real.	E ne e bile ea sebele.
They were going to have a party.	Ba ne ba il’o tšoara mokete.
It went fast.	E ile ea tsamaea kapele.
I just know it's the place.	Kea tseba feela hore ke sebaka seo.
It would be fun !.	E ka ba monate!.
How can you tell?	U ka tseba joang?
You have to think carefully.	U tlameha ho nahana hantle.
We would not have done this without you.	Re ka be re sa ka ra etsa sena ntle le uena.
Of course, the blame lies with us.	Ha e le hantle, molato o ho rōna.
It is better to know, to be that way.	Ho molemo ho tseba, ho ba ka tsela e joalo.
He said it was a big job.	A re ke mosebetsi o moholo.
We were here to help.	Re ne re le mona ho tla thusa.
She wept bitterly.	A lla ka bohloko.
He is near.	O haufi.
Make food together.	Etsa lijo hammoho.
You forget everything you know and play.	U lebala tsohle tseo u li tsebang le ho bapala.
He has a life.	O na le bophelo.
This is not just about us.	Sena ha se bue ka rona feela.
They are easy to do.	Li bonolo ho li etsa.
None of us know how to be human.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona ea tsebang ho ba motho.
She started to look a little better.	A qala ho shebahala a le betere hanyane.
It was not what he expected.	E ne e se seo a neng a se lebeletse.
They have a reason.	Ba bile le lebaka.
He had seen more than he expected.	O ne a bone ho feta kamoo a neng a lebeletse kateng.
I tried to get him to say that.	Ke ile ka leka ho etsa hore a bue joalo.
I will never ask you again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke o botsa.
That is not our job.	Joalo ha se mosebetsi oa rona.
I have to write about something.	Ke tlameha ho ngola ka ho hong.
Thanks for your question.	Kea leboha ka potso ea hau.
We have been friends for many years.	Re bile metsoalle ka lilemo tse ngata.
He saw nothing wrong with it.	O ne a sa bone letho le phoso.
Yes, to save his mind and his life.	Ee, ho boloka kelello ea hae le bophelo ba hae.
Anyone wants to work with you.	Mang kapa mang o batla ho sebetsa le uena.
Just because you could, you did.	Hobane feela u ne u ka khona, u entse joalo.
However, this is not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho joalo.
Therefore,	Ka hona,
I was reading.	Ke ne ke bala.
I'm not sure whose idea it was.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na e ne e le mohopolo oa mang.
He loved its power.	O ne a rata matla a eona.
Except for mom or dad.	Ntle le mme kapa ntate.
Three of them.	Tse tharo tsa tsona.
You can still do this.	O ntse o ka etsa sena.
It seemed like only one person to me.	E ne eka ke motho a le mong feela ho 'na.
Now we have to work.	Joale re tlameha ho sebetsa.
He goes after her to see you.	O ea ka mor'a hae ho u bona.
True, the hours are hard.	Ke 'nete, lihora li boima.
It was the first time he had ever told anyone the truth.	E ne e le lekhetlo la pele a bolella mang kapa mang 'nete.
He was with her there.	O ne a e-na le eena moo.
It's really fun.	E monate ruri.
A lot more, as it happened.	Ntho e ngata haholo, joalo ka ha ho ile ha etsahala.
Perhaps he would have gone with them instead.	Mohlomong a ka be a ile a tsamaea le bona ho e-na le hoo.
She is good at what she does.	O motle ho seo a se etsang.
I was not calling.	Ke ne ke sa letsa.
It's fun to see them.	Ho monate ho bona.
Both of these things certainly cannot be true.	Lintho tseo ka bobeli ehlile e ke ke ea e-ba 'nete.
This was something new.	Ena e ne e le ntho e ncha.
I did not realize.	Ha kea ka ka hlokomela.
Very nice place.	Sebaka se setle haholo.
What kind of work do you do there?	U etsa mosebetsi oa mofuta ofe moo?
I can't find it.	Ha ke e fumane.
He knew he had to sleep.	O ne a tseba hore o tlameha ho robala.
He is one of his special people.	Ke e mong oa batho ba hae ba hloahloa.
That's an old school.	Seo ke sekolo sa khale.
Second, think about it.	Ea bobeli, nahana ka eona.
She was beautiful.	O ne o le motle.
We will make them tell us where he is.	Re tla etsa hore ba re bolelle moo a leng teng.
Or he may refuse me.	Kapa a ka hana ho 'na.
I have never seen him refuse one.	Ha ke eso bone a hana le le leng.
Get an idea of ​​how the house works.	Fumana maikutlo a hore na ntlo e sebetsa joang.
I was not thinking well.	Ke ne ke sa nahane hantle.
Their approach is somewhat important.	Mokhoa oa bona ke oa bohlokoa ka tsela e itseng.
However, last week they discovered that this was not the case.	Leha ho le joalo, bekeng e fetileng ba ile ba fumana hore ho ke ke ha e-ba joalo.
Some people felt the same way we do.	Batho ba bang ba ne ba e-na le maikutlo a tšoanang le a rōna.
He had to give her a chance.	O ne a lokela ho mo fa monyetla.
You would not pay him enough to do it.	U ne u ke ke ua mo lefa chelete e lekaneng ho e etsa.
Do it if you like it, or not.	E etse haeba u rata, kapa u sa e rate.
Then you stay close to me.	Ebe o dula o le haufi le nna.
He will not let it go.	A ke ke a e tlohela.
I can't speak well.	Ha ke khone ho bua hantle.
I just had dinner.	Ke sa tsoa ja lijo tsa mantsiboea.
The important thing was recently.	Ntho ea bohlokoa e ne e sa tsoa.
You can return to work tomorrow.	U ka khutlela mosebetsing hosane.
I could play it all.	Ke ne ke khona ho bapala tsohle.
You could see it.	U ne u ka e bona.
So it's one thing, and it's another thing.	Kahoo ke ntho e le 'ngoe, 'me ke ntho e' ngoe hape.
Instead, we just thank you.	Ho e-na le hoo, re feela kea leboha.
However, it was not his way.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se tsela ea hae.
We make no mistake about it.	Ha re etse phoso ka seo.
However, this can be very good for us.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se ka ba molemo haholo ho rōna.
His mother did not suggest.	Mme wa hae ha a ka a etsa tlhahiso.
However, that was not the case at all.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ne ho se joalo ho hang.
But it is not.	Empa ha e eo.
The danger is obvious, but once you need to try.	Ho kotsi ho hlakile, empa hang ha o hloka ho leka.
It really plays well, and it looks a lot better in person.	E hlile e bapala hantle, 'me e shebahala e le betere haholo ka motho.
For too long.	Ka nako e telele haholo.
I ate breakfast every morning.	Ke ne ke ja lijo tsa hoseng hoseng ho hong le ho hong.
They begin to walk.	Ba qala ho tsamaea ka maoto.
They are not a group.	Ha se sehlopha.
This too is my opinion.	Le ena ke maikutlo a ka.
This is not the way.	Ena hase tsela.
I like this car.	Ke rata koloi ena.
The man was very strong.	Monna eo o ne a e-na le motho ea matla haholo.
That is not so important.	Seo ha se bohlokoa hakaalo.
It is difficult for us to comprehend such a thing.	Ho thata ho rona ho utloisisa ntho ea mofuta oo.
We cannot say that there is only one true path.	Re ke ke ra re ho na le tsela e le 'ngoe feela ea 'nete.
Some travel a lot.	Ba bang ba tsamaea haholo.
We will sleep now.	Re tla robala hona joale.
No one else has ever been.	Ha ho le ea mong ea kileng a ba teng.
Well, you do.	Be, u etsa joalo.
But my story starts with it.	Empa taba ea ka e qala ka eona.
It can be more fun at school, with your friends.	Ho ka ba monate ho feta sekolong, le metsoalle ea hau.
Your dad would be happy for that.	Ntate oa hao a ka thabela seo.
To anyone, anyone.	Ho motho, mang kapa mang.
However, I wonder why you decided to come.	Leha ho le joalo, kea ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha u nkile qeto ea ho tla.
Some were parents, many were not.	Ba bang e ne e le batsoali, ba bangata e ne e se bona.
See if he can get there.	Bona hore na a ka fihla moo.
There is no better way.	Haho tsela e ntle.
He came out.	O ile a tsoa.
Yet he had a place to go.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a e-na le sebaka seo a lokelang ho se tsamaea.
Day after day before.	Letsatsi ka mor'a letsatsi pele.
Being a mother is hard.	Ho ba mme ho thata.
But many people are afraid to be like that.	Empa batho ba bangata ba tšaba ho ba joalo.
We did not see anyone very much.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bona motho haholo.
I had no problem with that.	Ke ne ke sena bothata ka seo.
It is better to have any kind of life and then no life.	Ho molemo ho ba le mofuta ofe kapa ofe oa bophelo ebe ho se na bophelo.
This dog once belonged to someone else.	Ntja ena e kile ea e-ba ea motho e mong.
Some things are very close.	Lintho tse ling li haufi haholo.
Once in a while.	Hang ka nako.
I knew something was wrong.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ho na le ho hong ho phoso.
However, it was too late.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e se e le morao haholo.
You have to go there.	O lokela ho ya moo.
I'm so happy for all of them really.	Ke thabile haholo bakeng sa bona kaofela ehlile.
The fact is, most people do not.	'Nete ke hore batho ba bangata ha ba etse joalo.
I had no idea what he was talking about.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na o bua ka eng.
Everyone knew his job.	E mong le e mong o ne a tseba mosebetsi oa hae.
I will be trying this.	Ke tla be ke leka sena.
We did not find them.	Ha rea ​​ka ra li fumana.
Then you can get anything.	Joale u ka fumana eng kapa eng.
Even better is that no one knew who he was.	Ho molemo le ho feta ke hore ha ho motho ea neng a tseba hore na ke mang.
The young man continued to eat.	Mohlankana a tsoela pele ho ja.
Instead he was here.	Ho e-na le hoo o ne a le mona.
Some clothes take longer.	Liaparo tse ling li nka nako e telele.
I hope so.	Ke tšepa hore ho joalo.
It must be beautiful.	E tlameha ebe e ntle.
There is not enough time.	Haho nako e lekaneng.
He decided to stand up.	O ile a etsa qeto ea ho ema.
It is not a priority.	Ha se ntho e tlang pele.
Want to win.	Batla ho hlola.
They will go for it.	Ba tla ea bakeng sa eona.
However, they did not do so.	Leha ho le joalo, ha baa ka ba etsa joalo.
I need new shoes.	Ke hloka lieta tse ncha.
And this can be very dangerous.	'Me sena se ka ba kotsi haholo.
I'm already out of the room.	Ke se ke ntse ke tsoa ka phaposing.
None of us have ever felt this way before.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rōna ea kileng a ikutloa ka tsela ena pele.
It would be amazing if you could.	E ka ba ntho e makatsang haeba u ka khona.
I just want to be home.	Ke batla ho ba hae feela.
Time is of the essence, so start now!	Nako ke ea bohlokoa, kahoo qala hona joale!
That's exactly my point.	Ke eona taba ea ka hantle.
She's just beautiful.	O motle feela.
But they will be there.	Empa ba tla be ba le teng.
I am not the person they need.	Ha ke motho eo ba mo hlokang.
He was not that kind of person.	E ne e se motho oa mofuta oo.
Before this could happen, one had to speak.	Pele sena se ka etsahala, motho o ne a lokela ho bua.
To the one who has nothing.	Ho ea se nang letho.
You were a boy.	U ne u le moshanyana.
Each one exists as a place.	E 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e teng e le sebaka.
I would sleep.	Ke ne ke tla robala.
The power is there and we have to get in some way.	Matla a teng 'me re tlameha ho fihla ka tsela e itseng.
As a boy, he loved to sing.	Ha e sa le moshanyana, o ne a rata ho bina.
I still do not understand why.	Ke ntse ke sa utloisise lebaka.
You all want it.	Kaofela ha lona le batle.
Because he was dressed like one.	Hobane o ne a apere joalo ka e mong.
Just the name.	Lebitso feela.
This is a great way to save money too.	Ena ke mokhoa o motle oa ho boloka chelete hape.
Thank you so much for the help.	Ke leboha thuso haholo.
Is there something wrong? 	Ho na le phoso e itseng?
Then we made good progress.	Joale re ile ra tsoela pele hantle.
he asked.	a botsa.
And he should not talk to them.	Mme ha a lokela ho bua le bona.
I would ask you, but.	Ke ne ke tla u botsa, empa .
They may not stand for long.	Ba ka 'na ba se ke ba ema nako e telele.
It was not long.	E ne e se nako e telele.
I could not sleep there.	Ke ne nke ke ka robala moo.
He picked up the book.	O ile a nka buka eo.
He tried to.	O ile a leka ho.
Then she walked away crying.	Eaba oa tsamaea a lla.
She was better than my mother.	O ne a le betere ho feta mme ho nna.
I have been there several times with myself.	Ke bile teng ka makhetlo a 'maloa le 'na.
But, you know, that's what it is.	Empa, ua tseba, ke seo e leng sona.
You have to look for it.	O tlameha ho e batla.
This is what he wanted.	Sena ke seo a neng a se batla.
It may be best to do one thing at a time.	Ho ka ba molemo ho etsa ntho e le ’ngoe ka nako.
He spent a lot of money on that project.	O ile a sebelisa chelete e ngata mosebetsing oo.
These things were new to me.	Lintho tsena li ne li le ncha ho ’na.
They studied this subject for years.	Ba ile ba ithuta taba ena ka lilemo tse ngata.
But I get nothing.	Empa ha ke fumane letho.
It's easy for me.	Ho bonolo ho nna.
Both work very well.	Ka bobeli li sebetsa hantle haholo.
It does not exist.	Ha e eo.
I would understand if you take a chance on me.	Ke ne ke tla utloisisa haeba u nka monyetla ka nna.
Things seem to be moving fast.	Lintho li bonahala li tsamaea kapele.
You do not like this.	Ha o rate sena.
There is no other place you can be.	Haho sebaka se seng seo o ka bang ho sona.
Everything is in the vicinity of the walk.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e sebakeng se haufi le ho tsamaea.
I am such a person.	Ke motho ea joalo.
He did not speak.	Ha a ka a bua.
Of course, you should have only a few.	Ha e le hantle, o lokela ho ba le tse seng kae feela.
We both worked well on our own.	Ka bobeli re ne re sebetsa hantle re le bang.
It’s a local activity, of course.	Ke mosebetsi oa sebaka, ehlile.
Don't get this.	O seke wa fumana sena.
I don't think he does.	Ha ke nahane hore o etsa joalo.
Somehow, that was just the beginning.	Ka tsela e itseng, seo se ne se qala ho etsahala.
But this is not important.	Empa sena ha se bohlokoa.
She had a headache.	O ne a tšoeroe ke hlooho e bohloko.
But they had a wonderful day.	Empa ba bile le letsatsi le monate.
It has years, you can see.	E na le lilemo, u ka bona.
A deaf woman came.	Ho ile ha tla mosali ea se nang tsebe.
Why didn't you call first?	Ke hobane'ng ha u sa ka ua letsa pele?
Thank you so much for that.	Ke leboha haholo ka seo.
It seemed like everyone was going.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka bohle ba ea.
However, it is still very good.	Leha ho le joalo, e ntse e le ntle haholo.
They did not know about his accident.	Ba ne ba sa tsebe ka kotsi ya hae.
And maybe a good thing about that.	Mme mohlomong ntho e ntle ho seo.
They only come when they know they are at home.	Ba tla feela moo ba tsebang hore ba teng hae.
And the new one isn't much better.	'Me e ncha ha e betere haholo.
They saw their people as powerful.	Ba ne ba bona batho ba bona ba le matla.
I have to say this.	Ke lokela ho bolela sena.
They will win.	Ba tla hlola.
I'll be back here again.	Ke tla khutlela mona hape.
Simple thing.	Ntho e bonolo.
One reason is that they were probably only a few years old.	Lebaka le leng ke hore mohlomong ba ne ba e-na le lilemo tse seng kae.
Surprisingly bad.	E mpe ka mokhoa o makatsang.
Think that this is not true.	Nka hore sena hase 'nete.
I did not understand this.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise sena.
I did not know what to do with him.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke etse eng ka eena.
I'm so sorry.	Ke masoabi haholo.
There must have been an error.	E tlameha ebe ho bile le phoso.
And then they try.	Mme ebe ba leka.
The mind is a strange thing.	Kelello ke ntho e makatsang.
Every time you do that, you make this easier for me.	Nako le nako ha u etsa joalo, u etsa hore sena se be bonolo ho 'na.
This was not surprising at all.	Sena e ne e se ntho e makatsang ho hang.
Things are not as they used to be.	Lintho ha li joalo ka ha li ne li le joalo.
You will probably find that there are others like him.	Mohlomong o tla fumana hore ho na le ba bang ba tšoanang le eena.
They went to it.	Ba ile ho eona.
The first impression is all.	Maikutlo a pele ke tsohle.
There is no such thing, either.	Haho ntho e kang eo, hape.
It was good for him.	E ne e mo etsetsa molemo.
I will have to refuse.	Ke tla tlameha ho hana.
He asked so he paid.	O ile a botsa kahoo a lefa.
So they went to work every morning like everyone else.	Kahoo ba ile ba ea mosebetsing hoseng ho hong le ho hong joaloka motho e mong le e mong.
But as he looked closer, he realized that it was.	Empa ha a ntse a sheba haufi, o ile a fumana hore e ne e le eona.
Long time no see!	Ke khale ke sa u bone!
But he did not talk about it.	Empa ha a ka a bua ka eona.
I need to study the area.	Ke hloka ho ithuta sebaka seo.
Nobody ever said it.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a e bua.
He fits you well.	O u lekana hantle.
It goes on and on.	E ntse e tsoela pele.
There is nothing there when he looks.	Haho letho moo ha a sheba.
But when that time came, we did not go.	Empa ha nako eo e fihla, ha rea ​​ka ra ea ho eona.
However, he could tell her now.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a ka mo bolella hona joale.
He will come back to her, for sure.	O tla khutlela ho eena, o na le bonnete.
It seems to work well once you understand how they progress.	E bonahala e sebetsa hantle hang ha o utloisisa hore na ba tsoela pele joang.
And the police.	Le mapolesa.
I want to get back to work.	Ke batla ho khutlela mosebetsing.
You are not alone.	Ha o mong.
He did not understand.	O ne a sa utloisise.
From the first one they ever had, to the last one.	Ho tloha ho ea pele eo ba kileng ba ba le eona, ho fihlela ea ho qetela.
No need to spend money.	Ha ho hlokahale ho sebelisa chelete.
However, he may already be at home.	Leha ho le joalo, e ka 'na eaba o se a le hae.
He is the one you think he is.	Ke eena eo u nahanang hore ke eena.
It's just a thought.	Ke mohopolo feela.
I drove and drove and could not find it.	Ke ile ka khanna 'me ka khanna 'me ka se ke ka e fumana.
This can be the best.	Sena se ka ba molemo ka ho fetisisa.
But it did not matter.	Empa ho ne ho se na taba.
It was my first book.	E ne e le buka ea ka ea pele.
Soon, there will be no more pain.	Haufinyane, ho ke ke ha hlola ho e-ba le bohloko.
They are very sad.	Ba utloile bohloko haholo.
However, we did not find that to be true.	Leha ho le joalo, ha rea ​​ka ra fumana hore ho joalo.
They were too many.	Li ne li le ngata haholo.
Even good news.	Leha e le litaba tse ntle.
Or by question.	Kapa ka potso.
In any real work, you will never find that.	Mosebetsing ofe kapa ofe oa sebele, u ke ke ua fumana seo.
We could not believe our eyes.	Ha rea ​​ka ra lumela se ka pele.
I have had the same situation as before.	Ke bile le boemo bo tšoanang le ba pele.
We called her, but she did not arrive on time.	Re ile ra mo letsetsa, empa ha aa ka a fihla ka nako.
Then he wondered if he would ever see it again.	Joale o ne a ipotsa hore na o tla ke a e bone hape.
A girl like you.	Ngoanana ea kang uena.
He did not want to think about that.	O ne a sa batle ho nahana ka seo.
They will help you.	Ba tla o thusa.
Not to mention that a simple phone call can be very helpful.	Re sa bue ka mohala o bonolo o ka thusa haholo.
It’s just powerful, too.	E mpa e le matla, haholo.
Or he agreed.	Kapa o ile a lumela.
But then he tried to understand it.	Empa joale o ile a leka ho e utloisisa.
They know what we did.	Ba tseba seo re se entseng.
This was alive.	Sena se ne se phela.
They came back bad.	Ba ile ba khutla ba le mpe.
Wishing him.	Ho mo lakatsa.
I once used the phone.	Ke kile ka sebelisa mohala.
Someone who had spent his life for memory.	Motho ea neng a qetile bophelo ba hae bakeng sa mohopolo.
This is important to him.	Sena ke sa bohlokoa ho eena.
Now you can see.	Joale u ka bona.
But notice that they are not.	Empa hlokomela hore na ha ba joalo.
Tomorrow is breakfast day.	Hosane ke letsatsi la lijo tsa hoseng.
It will be here, and the place where you will live.	E tla ba mona, le sebaka seo le tla lula ho sona.
He did not think.	O ne a sa nahane.
Well so far.	Hantle ho fihlela joale.
That will come.	Seo se tla tla.
We have children of the same age.	Re na le bana ba lilemo tse tšoanang.
It's just that simple.	E bonolo feela joalo.
Some people will work very well.	Batho ba bang ba tla sebetsa hantle haholo.
I did not decide to leave.	Ha kea etsa qeto ea ho tsoa.
It's just too hard.	Ho thata haholo feela.
He was thirty years old.	O ne a le lilemo li mashome a mararo.
But he believed it could be powerful.	Empa o ile a lumela hore e ka ba matla.
However, the fault is still there.	Leha ho le joalo, phoso e ntse e le teng.
He did everything.	O entse tsohle.
I didn't even know what he was talking about.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe le hore na o bua ka eng.
He was there before.	O ne a le teng pele.
But they did the work.	Empa ba ile ba etsa mosebetsi.
It's nice to look outside and see the water.	Ho monate ho sheba ka ntle le ho bona metsi.
I will defeat you again.	Ke tla o hlola hape.
Is it tasty.	E monate.
Her boyfriend could not see.	Mohlankana oa hae o ne a sa bone.
But this information is only for you.	Empa litaba tsena ke tsa hau feela.
We will give it to you tomorrow.	Re tla u fa eona hosane.
Everyone will know your name.	Bohle ba tla tseba lebitso la hao.
This is not very fun.	Sena ha se monate haholo.
He looked tired, he thought.	O ne a bonahala a khathetse, a nahana joalo.
I can't decide.	Ha ke khone ho etsa qeto.
Him, for another.	Eena, bakeng sa e mong.
I know what happened.	Ke tseba se etsahetseng.
That is not the case at all.	Ha se taba eo ho hang.
It was difficult to say why he thought it was necessary.	Ho ne ho le thata ho bolela hore na ke hobane’ng ha a ne a nahana hore hoa hlokahala.
He did very well today.	O entse hantle haholo kajeno.
I will not buy this again.	Nke ke ka reka sena hape.
That is why he felt so happy.	Ke ka lebaka leo a ileng a ikutloa a thabile hakana.
I knew that was not the case.	Ke ne ke tseba hore ha ho joalo.
That is how the work will continue.	Ke kamoo mosebetsi o tla tsoela pele kateng.
Probably so.	Mohlomong ho joalo haholo.
You get to it.	U fihla ho eona.
He looked very good.	O ne a shebahala hantle haholo.
It has never been difficult.	Ha ho mohla e kileng ea ba boima.
But more than that.	Empa ho feta moo.
They have no sense.	Ha ba na kelello.
You will never find your home again.	U ke ke ua fumana ntlo ea hau hape.
If you could travel on time, would you?	Haeba u ne u ka tsamaea ka nako, na u ne u tla?
What it did is that.	E entseng ke hore.
However, he continued.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a tsoela pele.
He could have stopped, but he didn't.	A ka be a ile a ema, empa ha a ka a etsa jwalo.
He sat down and said he had something he wanted to tell me.	O ile a lula fatše 'me a re ho na le seo a batlang ho mpolella sona.
They were there and did that.	Ba bile moo mme ba etsa seo.
That's the way it was.	Ke kamoo ho neng ho le kateng.
He was happy.	O ne a thabile.
There is only one way to go.	Tsela e le 'ngoe feela ea ho tsamaea.
I will have to go back to him.	Ke tla tlameha ho khutlela ho eena.
I will look at it.	Ke tla e sheba.
The woman was very happy.	Mosali eo o ne a thabile haholo.
Feel strong.	Utloa ka matla.
Although he could not speak, he could sign.	Le hoja a ne a sa khone ho bua, o ne a khona ho bua ka matsoho.
But that was the essence of my work.	Empa hoo e ne e le bohlokoa ba mosebetsi oa ka.
I will tell you this.	Ke tla o bolella sena.
It is nice to have friends and good food.	Ho monate ho ba le metsoalle le lijo tse monate.
I agree, the boy said.	Kea lumela, moshanyana o ile a re.
It was more fun than doing that.	Ho ne ho le monate ho feta ho etsa joalo.
That you are here to stay.	Hore u mona ho lula.
I look good.	Ke sheba hantle.
It's been a while, well.	Esale e le hanyane, hantle.
We hope to start with that next year.	Re tšepa ho qala ka seo selemong se tlang.
They could have gone, of course.	Ba ka be ba ile, ehlile.
In that room.	Ka phaposing eo.
Things were going very well.	Lintho li ne li tsamaea hantle haholo.
It was not an easy task.	E ne e se mosebetsi o bonolo.
Very simple indeed.	Ho bonolo haholo ha e le hantle.
You also write.	Le uena ua ngola.
Here is the good news.	Litaba tse molemo ke tsena.
He had never seen anyone, he saw nothing good.	O ne a eso bone motho, a sa bone letho le monate.
If you do not have it, do it.	Haeba ha u na eona, e etse.
I really did not have it.	Ke ne ke hlile ke se na eona.
It will not help.	E ke ke ea thusa.
It's all his.	Ke oa hae kaofela.
However, their task was not easy.	Leha ho le joalo, mosebetsi oa bona o ne o se bonolo.
He was with me, and he knew it.	O ne a na le nna, mme o ne a e tseba.
As a result, we do not believe him.	Ka lebaka leo, ha re mo lumele.
Be careful not to go too far.	Hlokomela hore u se ke ua ea pele haholo.
Carefully, he thought.	Ka hloko, o ile a nahana.
Every issue, every time.	Taba e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe, nako le nako.
It was not easy to read.	Ho ne ho se bonolo ho bala.
It was good for him to stay busy.	Ho ne ho le molemo hore a lule a phathahane.
They could not walk or talk.	Ba ne ba sa khone ho tsamaea kapa ho bua.
More than that it seems to be true.	Ho feta moo ho bonahala e le 'nete.
He never spent a day in school.	Ho ne ho se mohla a kileng a qeta letsatsi sekolong.
I try to talk to him, but he seems out of place.	Ke leka ho bua le eena, empa oa bonahala.
He said he did the same.	O ile a re le eena o entse joalo.
But it was not enough.	Empa ho ne ho sa lekana.
What do you think of this book?	U nahana'ng ka buka ee?
But they were still fun.	Empa li ne li ntse li le monate.
It was for me and me, but nothing like that you went through.	E ne e le bakeng sa ka le 'na, empa ha ho letho le kang leo u fetileng ho lona.
It took a long time to write.	Ho ile ha nka nako e telele ho ngola.
asked the man.	ha botsa monna.
He asked questions.	O ile a botsa lipotso.
Who will eat shoes? 	Ke mang ea tla ja lieta?
I'm waiting for more.	Ke emetse tse ling hape.
They were really not human.	E ne e hlile e se batho.
However I agreed.	Leha ho le joalo ke ile ka lumela.
Some people do that.	Batho ba bang ba etsa joalo.
However, this does not seem to be enough for them.	Leha ho le joalo, sena se bonahala se sa lekana ho bona.
Or some of them do.	Kapa ba bang ba bona ba etsa joalo.
We wonder how things are going.	Rea ipotsa hore na lintho li tsamaea joang.
And they didn't care when they did it.	Mme ba ne ba sa tsotelle hore na ba e etsa neng.
This route is very old.	Tsela ena ke ea khale haholo.
Their decision is final.	Qeto ea bona ke ea ho qetela.
We need to eat with the family.	Re lokela ho ja hammoho le lelapa.
I don't need to tell you what happened.	Ha ke hloke ho o bolella se etsahetseng.
He wasn't really a man.	E ne e hlile e se monna.
There is no way to do this.	Haho mokhoa oa ho etsa sena.
I would be.	Nka ba.
That is where we will live.	Ke hona moo re tla dula teng.
Or he.	Kapa eena.
Also, by doing it a lot.	Hape, ka ho e etsa haholo.
It was really hard.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le thata.
However, the oldest.	Leha ho le joalo, ea khale ka ho fetisisa.
I will find them.	Ke tla ba fumana.
It was just us and it was fun.	E ne e le rona feela mme e ne e le monate.
It would be a good idea.	E ka ba mohopolo o motle.
He knew how good he was, but he never talked about him.	O ne a tseba kamoo a leng molemo kateng, empa ho ne ho se mohla a buang ka eena.
But you are no longer a boy.	Empa ha o sa le moshanyana.
It just won't work.	E mpa feela e ke ke ea sebetsa.
I really like it.	Ke e rata haholo.
To do what.	Ho etsa eng.
It was your book.	E ne e le buka ya hao.
I had no idea he would be here.	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore o tla ba teng mona.
We also don't know anything about his mother.	Le rona ha re tsebe letho ka mme wa hae.
He did not get it.	Ha a ka a e fumana.
He was not sure.	O ne a sena bonnete.
That would be easy.	Hoo ho ka ba bonolo.
And they helped.	Mme ba ile ba thusa.
And so it was the law.	'Me kahoo e ne e le molao.
You can get whatever you want.	O ka fumana eng kapa eng eo o e batlang.
He leaves it far behind.	O e tlohela morao haholo.
The woman agreed.	Mosali o ile a lumela.
It is better to take it without asking.	Ho molemo ho nka feela ntle le ho botsa.
But that is probably the case.	Empa mohlomong ho joalo feela.
They often do.	Hangata ba etsa joalo.
And he used them.	'Me a li sebelisa.
Whether you like it or not, you get a second chance.	Hore na ua rata kapa che, u fumana monyetla oa bobeli.
So far there are many surprises.	Ho fihlela joale ho na le lintho tse ngata tse makatsang.
People were good to us.	Batho ba ne ba le molemo ho rona.
He lives here.	O lula mona.
I will never forget this.	Ruri nke ke ka lebala ena.
It will not hold.	E ke ke ea tšoara.
This is one of the best.	Ena ke e 'ngoe ea tse ntle.
However, he had to get home on time.	Leha ho le joalo, o ile a tlameha ho fihla hae ka nako.
He never said it again.	Ha a ka a hlola a re.
As you know, it's nighttime here.	Joalo ka ha le tseba, ke bosiu mona.
He continued to work.	A tsoela pele ho sebetsa.
We will not be able to do that.	Re ke ke ra khona ho etsa joalo.
It was something that the people did not understand.	Ke ntho eo batho ba neng ba sa e utloisise.
People did not expect to stand.	Batho ba ne ba sa lebella hore ba tla ema.
Of course, they talked sometimes.	Ke ’nete hore ba ne ba bua ka linako tse ling.
Strange grief overcame them.	Masoabi a makatsang a ile a ba hlola.
But it is not good for me.	Empa ha ho molemo ho nna.
Find only three things you like.	Fumana feela lintho tse tharo tseo u li ratang.
Some of them even talk.	Ba bang ba bona ba bile ba bua.
One of them came to him.	E mong oa bona a tla ho eena.
If in doubt, say nothing.	Haeba u belaela, u se ke ua bua letho.
This is not what we want.	Sena ha se ntho eo re e batlang.
I had all three until yesterday.	Ke bile le tse tharo kaofela ho fihlela maobane.
It stops us.	E re ema.
The children were preparing breakfast.	Bana ba ne ba lokisa lijo tsa hoseng.
I can't find them anywhere.	Ha ke li fumane kae kapa kae.
The truth is very hard to find.	'Nete e thata haholo ho e fumana.
Try well man.	Leka hantle monna.
No, no.	Che, che.
But one thing.	Empa ntho e le 'ngoe .
There are also children there.	Hape ho na le bana ba teng.
Nothing is too hard.	Ha ho letho le thata hakaalo.
No one needs these things.	Ha ho motho ea hlokang lintho tsena.
You made me believe that you would stand by me.	U entse hore ke lumele hore u tla ema le 'na.
I ask him a few questions.	Ke mo botsa lipotso tse 'maloa.
Every family has its own outdoor home.	Lelapa le leng le le leng le na le ntlo ea lona e ka ntle.
This too is nothing new.	Sena le sona ha se ntho e ncha.
I have to stand like everyone else.	Ke tlameha ho ema joalo ka batho bohle.
He must live.	O tlameha ho phela.
I just want to understand this.	Ke batla feela ho utloisisa sena.
These are very good and will help you a lot.	Tsena li ntle haholo 'me li tla u thusa haholo.
It's your idea.	Ke mohopolo wa hao.
He left one morning and did not return.	O ile a tsamaea hoseng ho hong 'me ha aa ka a khutla.
You can do this well.	Le ka etsa sena hantle.
This is another such place.	Ena ke sebaka se seng se joalo.
But that doesn't matter much.	Empa hoo ha ho na taba haholo.
He read occasionally.	O ne a bala ka linako tse ling.
He said, hold on.	O ile a re, tšoara.
You should read this book.	O lokela ho bala buka ena.
He no longer goes to this school.	Ha a sa ea sekolong sena.
You got it.	U e fumane.
He is not alone in feeling that way.	Ha se eena feela ea etsang lintho tse kang tsena.
She was just beautiful.	O ne a le motle feela.
You can leave now if you feel the need.	U ka tsamaea hona joale haeba u ikutloa u hloka.
Or he could have it.	Kapa o ne a ka ba le eona.
In fact, that is how he loved it.	Ha e le hantle, ke tsela eo a neng a e rata ka eona.
It is important to fix it.	Ho bohlokoa ho e lokisa.
I see it now.	Ke a e bona jwale.
He would never wear it again.	O ne a sa tlo hlola a e apara hape.
You do not meet us.	Ha o kopane le rona.
I quickly decided on something else.	Ke ile ka etsa qeto kapele ka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Opinions work the same way.	Maikutlo a sebetsa ka tsela e tšoanang.
He asked where he was from.	A botsa hore na o tsoa kae.
He ate a delicious breakfast.	O ile a ja lijo tsa hoseng tse monate.
They have nothing in common.	Ha ba na letho leo ba tšoanang ka lona.
They have no reason not to take it, either.	Ha ba na lebaka la ho se o nke, le bona.
Most children in this area have to work.	Bana ba bangata sebakeng sena ba tlameha ho sebetsa.
I can say that.	Nka bolela seo.
I have that too.	Le nna ke na le seo.
He did not sleep at all that night.	O ne a sa robala ho hang bosiung boo.
I'm just that kind of player.	Ke sebapali sa mofuta oo feela.
I am in good health.	Ke ntse ke phela hantle.
You see people who love you, often who love you.	U bona batho ba u ratang, hangata ba u ratang.
Everything is amazing.	Ntho e ngoe le e ngoe e makatsang.
It was a group, here it was one group.	E ne e le sehlopha, mona e ne e le sehlopha se le seng.
It will be fun to use it.	Ho tla ba monate ho e sebelisa.
Sometimes he was, and sometimes he was not.	Ka linako tse ling o ne a le teng, 'me ka linako tse ling a le sieo.
Of course there was nothing important in it.	Ha e le hantle ho ne ho se letho la bohlokoa ho eona.
This was a time when there was nothing he could do that would help anyone.	Ena e ne e le nako e 'ngoe moo ho neng ho se letho leo a le entseng le neng le ka thusa motho.
In the end, it proved to be true.	Qetellong, ho ile ha bonahala e le ’nete.
That car belongs to my father.	Koloi eo ke ea Ntate.
Water flows from it.	Metsi a tsoa ho eona.
We did a great job and the bike works well.	Re entse mosebetsi o motle mme baesekele ea sebetsa hantle.
And Dad.	Le Ntate.
He knew he would never come back here.	O ne a tseba hore a ke ke a hlola a khutlela mona.
She is useless.	Ha a na thuso.
But it was not him.	Empa e ne e se eena.
Now they are important people.	Hona joale ke batho ba bohlokoa.
This is not a matter for children.	Sena ha se taba ea bana.
We will know.	Re tla tseba.
I'm not saying it can't happen.	Ha ke re e ke ke ea etsahala.
The man told me not to say anything.	Monna eo o ile a mpolella hore ke se ke ka bua letho.
There are many of them.	Ho na le tse ngata tsa tsona.
I have a problem understanding him.	Ke na le bothata ba ho mo utloisisa.
Open the book and you can read.	Bula buka 'me u ka bala.
Enjoy the group.	Thabela sehlopha.
It is stupid and needs help.	Ke ntho e hlokang kelello le e hlokang thuso.
He also loves to travel.	Hape o rata ho tsamaea.
He left first.	O ile a tloha pele.
I have a mistake.	Ke na le phoso.
I want to know him.	Ke batla ho mo tseba.
He was tired, but he was happy.	O ne a khathetse, empa a thabile.
I know the people there.	Ke tseba batho ba teng.
You can eat anything with good people.	U ka ja ntho leha e le efe hammoho le batho ba molemo.
One of them is driving a car.	E 'ngoe ea tsona ke ho khanna koloi.
I suggest walking now.	Ke etsa tlhahiso ea ho tsamaea hona joale.
I'm glad you don't have a problem with this.	Ke thabela hore ebe ha le na bothata le taba ena.
Clearly, she was deeply hurt.	Ho hlakile hore o ne a utloile bohloko haholo.
They are almost alone there.	Ba batla ba le bang moo.
He knew he had a problem.	O ne a tseba hore o na le bothata.
Her father died when she was a child.	Ntate oa hae o ile a hlokahala ha e sa le ngoana.
But they do not have them that way.	Empa ha ba na tsona ka tsela eo.
Keep up the good work!	Tsoela pele ka mosebetsi o motle!
If you are in school, use the school name.	Haeba u le sekolong, sebelisa lebitso la sekolo.
He never was.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a ba joalo.
It really is old.	Ehlile ke ea khale.
Here is the first one.	Ea pele ke ena.
None of them are new.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe ea tsona e ncha.
She is a mother for a week.	O mme ka beke.
But this group did not understand.	Empa sehlopha sena se ne se sa utloisise.
It took several hours.	Ho nkile lihora tse 'maloa.
There was nothing.	Ho ne ho se letho.
And to be better.	Le ho ba betere.
Like children, they are.	Joaloka bana, ba joalo.
What made you decide to do that?	Ke eng e entseng hore u etse qeto ea ho etsa joalo?
A long time ago, several times.	Khale khale, makhetlo a 'maloa.
I used to do that.	Ke ne ke tloaetse ho etsa joalo.
He had never existed, and he never did.	O ne a eso be teng mme e ne e le teng.
Maybe we can.	Mohlomong re ka .
Apply to your hair once again.	Kopa moriri oa hau hang hape.
Yes, some of us are learning to play these things!	E, ba bang ba rona re ithuta ho bapala lintho tsena!
It still was.	Ho ne ho ntse ho le jwalo.
Or, if they had it, they would not have understood it well.	Kapa, ​​haeba ba ne ba e-na le eona, ba ka be ba sa e utloisisa hantle.
He is not bad.	Ha a mpe.
He knew he was in danger.	O ne a tseba hore o kotsing.
He did not think so.	O ne a sa e nahana ka tsela eo.
We spent a lot of time on it.	Re ile ra qeta nako e ngata ho eona.
I've done that many times, actually.	Ke entse joalo hangata, ha e le hantle.
Soon, we will learn the truth.	Haufinyane, re tla ithuta ’nete.
Sleep, of course.	Ho robala, ehlile.
We found this tool.	Re fumane sebetsa sena.
And real.	Le ea sebele.
This is the fourth time this has happened.	Ke lekhetlo la bone sena se etsahala.
We played the whole team.	Re ile ra bapala sehlopha sohle.
We were unable to arrive.	Ha rea ​​ka ra khona ho fihla.
I could hear them talking.	Ke ne ke utloa ha ba bua.
There is something strange about it.	Ho na le ntho e makatsang ka eona.
There was no denying it.	Ho ne ho se na ho hana.
The same day.	Letsatsi lona leo.
But it couldn't be, he knew that now.	Empa e ne e ke ke ya ba jwalo, o ne a tseba seo jwale.
I never went back to that.	Ha kea ka ka khutlela ho seo.
He was asking about food, asking what it was.	O ne a botsa ka lijo, a botsa hore na ke eng.
And many of them.	Le tse ngata tsa tsona.
I am a danger.	Ke nna kotsi.
Children have to go to school every day.	Bana ba tlameha ho ea sekolong letsatsi le leng le le leng.
And this was his kind of place.	Mme ena e ne e le sebaka sa hae sa mofuta.
Indeed, in the past it has done so.	Ka sebele, nakong e fetileng e entse joalo.
It took several hours.	Ho ile ha nka lihora tse ’maloa.
Like a girl.	Joalo ka ngoanana.
You did not do that.	Ha ua ka ua etsa joalo.
Without it there was nothing.	Ntle le eona ho ne ho se letho.
Looking for more things today.	Ho batla lintho tse ngata kajeno.
Nobody knows where he is.	Haho motho ya tsebang moo a leng teng.
I like playing.	Ke rata ho bapala.
We've been here for hours.	Re bile mona ka lihora tse ngata.
Look what he's talking about.	Sheba seo a buang ka sona.
It is an opportunity for him.	Ke monyetla ho eena.
I love how it happened.	Ke rata kamoo ho etsahetseng kateng.
He does nothing.	Ha a etse letho.
They do not know when they are healthy.	Ha ba tsebe ha ba phela hantle.
It was not just a surprise.	E ne e se ntho e makatsang feela.
It's just better, in my opinion.	Ho molemo feela, ka maikutlo a ka.
It seemed to be nonexistent.	E ne eka ha e eo.
They were just as important to him.	E ne e le ba bohlokoa feela ho eena.
It is a wonderful place to be.	Ke sebaka se monate ho ba ho sona.
You just have to love him the way he loves you.	U tlameha feela ho mo rata ka tsela eo a u ratang ka eona.
He always has.	O na le kamehla.
I think.	kea e nahana.
I know who her father was, too.	Kea tseba hore ntate oa hae e ne e le mang, le eena.
They did not cry.	Ha baa ka ba lla.
There were no problems at work.	Ho ne ho se na mathata mosebetsing.
I don’t even want to see that work until it arrives.	Ha ke batle le ho bona mosebetsi oo ho fihlela o fihla.
This he may not do.	Sena a ka 'na a se ke a se etsa.
He wants you to know that he has feelings.	O batla hore o tsebe hore o na le maikutlo.
Name, that's mine.	Lebitso, seo ke sa ka.
I don't see many people.	Ha ke bone batho ba bangata.
It is not enough.	Ha hoa lekana.
I know I see.	Kea tseba hore ke bona.
We do our best.	Re etsa sohle seo re ka se khonang.
Once it is not enough.	Hang ha hoa lekana.
They were very important.	E ne e le ba bohlokoa haholo.
To other people.	Ho batho ba bang.
This morning, of course.	Hoseng hona, ruri.
He did not get it.	Ha a ka a e fumana.
She said she would not leave her husband.	O ile a re a ke ke a tlohela monna oa hae.
However, that does not matter.	Leha ho le joalo, seo hase bohlokoa.
He wanted, he thought.	O ne a batla, a nahana.
Danger.	Kotsi.
Yet he feels for me, he loves you.	Leha ho le joalo a ikutloa ka 'na, oa u rata.
Some say that people were just tired.	Ba bang ba re batho ba ne ba khathetse feela.
There have been several recently.	Ho bile le tse 'maloa haufinyane.
He could never be that way again.	O ne a ke ke a hlola a ba jwalo.
Sadly, they do not seem to think that way.	Ka masoabi, ha ba bonahale e le batho ba nahanang hantle.
She thinks the baby is beautiful.	O nahana hore ngoana o motle.
Yet he was here.	Leha ho le joalo o ne a le teng mona.
He is too busy to leave.	O phathahane haholo hore o ka tloha.
No, don't tell me.	Che, u se ke ua mpolella.
There is no sun tomorrow.	Ha ho letsatsi hosane.
I did not go back.	Ha kea ka ka khutlela morao.
In fact, her mother died as a child.	Ha e le hantle, ’mè oa hae o ile a hlokahala e sa le ngoana.
He met.	O ile a kopana le.
I would love to have one of them.	Nka thabela ho ba le e 'ngoe ea tsona.
I really enjoy reading it.	Ke thabela ho e bala haholo.
This is going to work.	Ena e ea sebetsa.
Then he needed to sleep.	Joale o ne a hloka ho robala.
You wanted to live with me, once.	O ne o batla ho phela le nna, hang.
No one will ever talk to her like me.	Ha ho na motho eo a tla bua le eena joaloka 'na.
We got right in.	Re ile ra kena hantle.
But he saw nothing of this.	Empa ha a ka a bona letho la sena.
I work hard.	Ke sebetsa ka thata.
I had a few.	Ke ne ke e-na le tse seng kae.
He will not speak to us.	A ke ke a bua le rona.
So we started working on that.	Kahoo re ile ra qala ho sebetsa ho seo.
He has always existed.	Haesale a le teng.
That's almost soon.	Ke hoo e batlang e le haufinyane.
Just then the phone rang.	Ka eona nako eo mohala o ile oa lla.
And he will.	Mme o tla etsa jwalo.
At the same time, you value your friends.	Ka nako e tšoanang, u nka metsoalle ea hao e le batho ba bohlokoa.
And it can be.	Mme ho ka ba jwalo.
Either bad, though really bad.	Leha e le mpe, leha e hlile e le mpe.
They often slept late at night.	Hangata ba ne ba robala bosiu haholo.
But he never did.	Empa ha ho mohla a kileng a etsa joalo.
He sleeps again.	O robala hape.
I had that.	Ke ne ke ena le seo.
I'm not talking about that.	Ha ke bue ka tseo.
But something told her not to do that.	Empa ntho e ’ngoe e ne e mo boleletse hore a se ke a etsa joalo.
She loved her car so much, her husband bought it too.	O ne a rata koloi ea hae haholo, monna oa hae le eena a e reka.
And many more so we want to save.	Le tse ling tse ngata kahoo re batla ho boloka.
But whatever, man.	Empa eng kapa eng, monna.
He knew what had happened to him.	O ne a tseba hore na ho etsahetse’ng ka eena.
None of it worked well.	Ha ho le e 'ngoe e ileng ea sebetsa hantle.
What is that.	Ke eng hoo.
Give or take several years.	Fana kapa nka lilemo tse 'maloa.
Everyone had an opinion.	E mong le e mong o ne a e-na le maikutlo.
He was just not good.	O ne a se motle feela.
I have to go again.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea hape.
It's you, isn't it?	Ke uena, ha ho joalo?
I can't even say sorry.	Ha ke khone le ho re masoabi.
For hours and hours.	Ka lihora le lihora.
I didn't want to either.	Le nna ke ne ke sa batle.
I had the exact same issue.	Ke ne ke e-na le taba e tšoanang hantle.
They will have to work.	Ba tla tlameha ho sebetsa.
She will take good care of her children.	O tla hlokomela bana ba hae hantle.
It is not good and will require some work.	Ha e ntle 'me e tla hloka mosebetsi o itseng.
But he was still hearing it.	Empa o ne a ntse a e utloa.
I noticed a few of them.	Ke ile ka hlokomela tse ’maloa tsa tsona.
That's one of his things.	Eo ke e 'ngoe ea lintho tsa hae.
Probably too much.	Mohlomong e ngata haholo.
Everyone in the room goes back.	Motho e mong le e mong ka kamoreng o khutlela morao.
He needed something else.	O ne a hloka ho hong hape.
They know nothing, and they probably don't care about anything, about the problem.	Ha ba tsebe letho, mme mohlomong ha ba tsotelle letho, ka bothata boo.
We know your pain.	Re tseba bohloko ba hao.
Both were empty.	Ka bobeli li ne li se na letho.
We will not sit down.	Re ke ke ra lula fatše.
We will do that.	Re tla etsa joalo.
I don’t even think this should be hard to achieve.	Ha ke nahane le hore sena se lokela ho ba thata ho se fihlela.
What more could you ask for?	U ka kopa eng hape?
We go as fast as we can.	Re tsamaea kapele kamoo re ka khonang.
Anything, as it really is.	Eng kapa eng, joalo ka ha e le hantle.
He offers coffee.	O fana ka kofi.
Give this to the boy.	Fana ka sena ho moshanyana.
I'd like to start there.	Ke kopa ho qala moo.
I'm so glad you can come.	Ke thabile haholo ha o ka tla.
We wanted to save the party.	Re ne re batla ho boloka mokete.
Time passed and passed.	Nako e ile ea feta 'me ea feta.
They had made their decision.	Ba ne ba entse qeto ea bona.
However, it was the last thing.	Leha ho le joalo, e ne e le ntho ea ho qetela.
They came together when he asked for a job.	Ba ile ba tla hammoho ha a kopa mosebetsi.
I had never seen that before.	Ke ne ke eso bone seo pele.
She wanted to take care of her son.	O ne a lakatsa ho hlokomela mora oa hae.
So they are tough.	Kahoo ba thata.
This is near.	Sena se haufi.
But they did not know, of course.	Empa ba ne ba sa tsebe, ehlile.
You know that's right.	Ua tseba hore ho joalo.
It takes a lot of time to think about it.	Ho nka nako e ngata ho nahana ka eona.
This was not true.	Sena e ne e se 'nete.
That's the feeling that went with it.	Ke maikutlo a ileng a tsamaea le eona.
You will have to find another reason why they should take you.	U tla tlameha ho fumana lebaka le leng leo ka lona ba lokelang ho u nka.
I'm not sure what that was all about.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na hoo ho ne ho bua ka eng.
And not many people do.	Mme ha se batho ba bangata ba e etsang.
I look at his question without knowing anything.	Ke sheba potso ea hae ke sa tsebe letho.
I had a good understanding of what he went through as a child.	Ke ne ke utloisisa hantle seo a fetileng ho sona ha e sa le ngoana.
Or they thought they knew.	Kapa ba ne ba nahana hore baa tseba.
Age and years of service.	Lilemo le lilemo tsa mosebetsi.
Here I am, man.	Ke mona, monna.
I just wanted to sing and perform.	Ke ne ke batla feela ho bina le ho etsa.
How long was the party going on?	Mokete oo o ne o le nako e kae?
No one has ever been out there.	Ha ho motho ea kileng a tsoa moo.
He knew the genre well.	O ne a tseba mofuta oo hantle.
He drove, unknowingly.	O ile a khanna, a sa tsebe.
Many people use it.	Batho ba bangata ba e sebelisa.
What he is now.	Seo a leng sona hona joale.
Then we write about them.	Ebe re ngola ka tsona.
If you do not want to learn more about the car.	Haeba u sa e batle ho ithuta haholoanyane ka koloi.
The phone was ringing loudly.	Mohala o ne o lla haholo.
Night for sure now.	Bosiu ka 'nete hona joale.
He was the one everyone wanted to get out of high school.	Ke eena eo bohle ba neng ba batla ho tsoa sekolong se phahameng.
I started to feel better.	Ke ile ka tloha ke ikutloa ke le betere.
If you want a nice home, you pay more.	Haeba u batla ntlo e ntle, u lefa ho feta.
What's going on there? 	Ho etsahalang moo?
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
He saw their mistake now.	O bone phoso ya bona jwale.
One of his life.	E 'ngoe ea bophelo ba hae.
I think that still exists, to me.	Ke nahana hore seo se ntse se le teng, ho nna.
It was the funniest thing.	E ne e le ntho e monate ka ho fetisisa.
Like back in high school.	Joalo ka morao sekolong se phahameng.
I could watch him for hours.	Ke ne ke khona ho mo shebella ka lihora tse ngata.
They loved it.	Ba ile ba e rata.
I can't do well.	Ha ke khone ho etsa hantle.
I can help her with that.	Nka mo thusa ka seo.
News does not matter.	Litaba ha li na taba.
But he obviously did not have it.	Empa ho hlakile hore o ne a se na eona.
Did you know what it is.	Na u ne u tseba ke eng.
However, you will still have a second longer line.	Leha ho le joalo, u ntse u tla ba le mohala oa bobeli o telele.
In the area.	Sebakeng.
I got coffee.	Ke fumane kofi.
It's not that we do this for fun.	Ha se hore re etsa sena bakeng sa monate.
Also, it is very simple.	Hape, e bonolo haholo.
Find someone who will love you.	Fumana motho e mong ea tla mo rata.
Water is needed to sustain life.	Metsi a hlokahala bakeng sa ho boloka bophelo bohle.
But it is never too late.	Empa ha ho mohla e leng morao haholo.
He did not live up to his expectations.	O ne a eso fumane seo a neng a se lebeletse.
We would love to have you !.	Re ka thabela ho ba le uena!.
I do not know why he spoke to me about this.	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ile a bua le 'na ka taba ena.
I think this too is my job.	Ke nahana hore le ona ke mosebetsi oa ka.
You can read it because of its importance.	U ka e bala ka lebaka la bohlokoa ba eona.
It works for them.	E sebetsa ho bona.
It is finally your night.	Qetellong ke bosiu ba hao.
We know they are not.	Rea tseba hore ha ba joalo.
Do not pay anything.	U se ke ua lefa letho.
However, he really did not want to know.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a hlile a sa batle ho tseba.
It took a long time before he could think straight.	Ho ile ha nka nako e telele pele a ka nahana hantle.
You would not care.	O ne o ka se tsotelle.
He has an easy job.	O na le mosebetsi o bonolo.
I took his money.	Ke nkile chelete ea hae.
I didn't see him come out much.	Ha kea ka ka mo bona a tsoa haholo.
As a mother, her family is very important.	Joaloka 'mè, ntho ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa ea hae ke lelapa.
He knew there was something wrong.	O ne a tseba hore ho na le phoso.
One more time.	Nako e 'ngoe hape.
He will go, but he will not stay.	O tla tsamaea, empa eena a ke ke a lula.
That trust was exactly what my father needed.	Ho tšepa hoo ke sona seo Ntate a neng a se hloka.
We all want it.	Kaofela rea ​​e batla.
Last year.	Selemong se fetileng.
No, he is not.	Che, ha a joalo.
If so, it is best to walk alone.	Haeba ho joalo, ho molemo hore u tsamaee u le mong.
Do you have what it needs ?.	O na le seo e se hlokang?.
But he can give you whatever you want without food.	Empa a ka u fa eng kapa eng eo u e batlang ntle le lijo.
Nice place.	Sebaka se setle.
I wanted him to leave.	Ke ne ke batla hore a tsamaee.
If in doubt, say it now.	Haeba u belaela, e re hona joale.
When we arrived, it was too late.	Ha re fihla, e ne e se e le morao haholo.
But it can be.	Empa ho ka ba jwalo.
People learn to give when they see people giving.	Batho ba ithuta ho fana ha ba bona batho ba fana.
Everyone was equal.	Batho bohle ba ne ba lekana.
When this happens, be careful.	Ha sena se etsahala, hlokomela.
That was obvious.	Hoo ho ne ho hlakile.
This is an empty space.	Sebaka sena se se nang letho.
He stood up.	A ema ka maoto.
The fourth remained empty.	Ea bone e ile ea lula e se na motho.
Of course it is not a book.	Ehlile ha se buka.
He eats real.	O ja tsa sebele.
Who knows, they might even ask for your help.	Ke mang ea tsebang, a ka ba a kopa thuso ea hau.
It's a big job.	Ke mosebetsi o moholo.
They also mean work for me.	Le bona ba bolela mosebetsi ho nna.
And it's mine.	Mme ke ya ka.
Unless it is.	Ntle le haeba ha ho joalo.
Or if they did, they did not know what to do with it.	Kapa haeba ba entse joalo ba ne ba sa tsebe hore na ba etse eng ka eona.
It's just a car.	Ke koloi feela.
Several times.	Ka makhetlo a 'maloa.
I hope you will be able to.	Ke tšepa hore u tla khona.
So it should not be.	Kahoo ha hoa lokela ho ba joalo.
It was easy.	Ho ne ho bile bonolo.
I could say a lot.	Ke ne ke khona ho bolela haholo.
I'm with you.	Ke na le uena.
This is a family affair, too.	Ena ke taba ea lelapa, hape.
I should not have left.	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho tloha.
Here in all, he thought.	Mona ho tsohle, o ile a nahana.
I can no longer walk.	Ha ke sa khona ho tsamaea.
They look great.	Li bonahala li le ntle.
Her husband can't reach her.	Monna oa hae ha a khone ho mo fihlela.
The boy has to finish his homework early.	Moshanyana o lokela ho qeta mosebetsi oa hae oa sekolo kapele.
Not sure how effective it is.	Ha u tsebe hantle hore na e sebetsa hantle hakae.
He had no job.	O ne a se na mosebetsi.
Ask your friends and get their opinion.	Botsa metsoalle ea hau 'me u fumane maikutlo a eona.
It got a few things.	E fumane lintho tse 'maloa.
And he did that very well.	Mme o entse seo hantle haholo.
Food is good.	Lijo li molemo.
Her baby was with her.	Ngoana oa hae o ne a e-na le eena.
There is a time to give up.	Ho na le nako ea ho tlohela.
She is happy for him.	O mo thabetse.
He is just like that.	O joalo feela.
I had to ask about it again.	Ke ile ka tlameha ho botsa ka eona hape.
I will never do that to any of my children.	Ha ke sa tla etsa joalo ho ngoana leha e le ofe oa ka.
It was only when.	E ne e le feela ha .
The party has just begun.	Mokete o sa tsoa qala.
Then, nothing happened.	Joale, ha ho letho le ileng la etsahala.
Make it easy to understand.	Etsa hore ho be bonolo ho e utloisisa.
That's what he didn't realize.	Ke seo a sa kang a se hlokomela.
I hope you haven't logged in.	Ke tšepa hore ha ua kena.
I'll let you talk.	Ke tla u lumella ho bua litaba.
He would be outside.	O ne a tla be a le ka ntle.
The work is still busy, and so is my life.	Mosebetsi o ntse o phathahane, 'me ho joalo le ka bophelo ba ka.
We don't really care enough.	Ha re hlile ha re tsotelle ho lekana.
But now she had no clothes.	Empa joale o ne a se a se na liaparo.
It was easy to draw.	Ho ne ho le bonolo ho etsa setšoantšo.
I know it works, but.	Kea tseba hore oa sebetsa, empa.
That will not happen.	Seo se ke ke sa etsahala.
I wish he could go.	Ke lakatsa eka a ka tsamaea.
I just wanted to talk.	Ke ne ke batla ho bua feela.
And new clothes.	Le liaparo tse ncha.
Three out of three.	Tse tharo ho tse tharo.
They said they would try again.	Ba re ba tla leka hape.
So last week we received news from his family.	Kahoo bekeng e fetileng re fumane litaba ho tsoa ho lelapa la hae.
No it was not time.	Che ho ne ho se nako.
He needs to make his decision.	Hoa hlokahala hore a etse qeto ea hae.
But they never said what they needed.	Empa ha ho mohla ba kileng ba bua seo ba se hlokang.
I was fine.	Ke ne ke le hantle.
You were trying to help.	U ne u leka ho thusa.
In my opinion it is so here.	Ka maikutlo a ka ho joalo mona.
And there is no reason to do so.	'Me ha ho na lebaka la ho etsa joalo.
There was no second time.	Ho ne ho se na nako ea bobeli.
Everyone thought it was the worst thing you could say.	E mong le e mong o ne a nahana hore ke ntho e mpe ka ho fetisisa eo o ka e buang.
They needed to feel that he would care for them.	Ba ne ba lokela ho ikutloa hore o tla ba hlokomela.
I didn't have to ask him.	Ha kea tlameha ho mo botsa.
And in that first year.	Mme selemong seo sa pele.
I think many.	Ke nahana ba bangata.
There is such a thing as being too late.	Ho na le ntho e kang morao haholo.
That was someone else.	Eo e ne e le motho e mong.
It would not.	E ne e ke ke.
I was the first to see this.	Ke 'na oa pele ea ileng a bona sena.
You should definitely visit.	U lokela ho etela ka sebele.
We want to move on.	Re batla ho tsoela pele.
Anywhere, at this point in his life.	Kapa kae kapa kae, nakong ena ea bophelo ba hae.
Just look ahead	Sheba pele feela
Well, we did it.	Be, re e entse.
Yes, he did.	E, o ne a e bolela.
We spent a lot of money to buy them.	Re ile ra sebelisa chelete e ngata ho li reka.
No one asked a single question.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a botsa potso e le 'ngoe.
he wondered.	a ipotsa.
However, I am not sure if it will work.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke na bonnete ba hore e ea sebetsa.
You can stay there tonight.	U ka lula moo bosiung bona.
It is not just about food.	Ha se feela ka lijo.
You are a strong woman.	U mosali ea matla.
We can't understand it.	Ha re khone ho e utloisisa.
They went out and started spending money.	Ba ile ba tsoa 'me ba qala ho sebelisa chelete.
I have to be late.	Ke tlameha ho ba morao.
In fact, you try very hard.	Ha e le hantle, u leka ka matla haholo.
It’s usually every man of his.	Hangata ke monna e mong le e mong oa hae.
We said nothing, stopped.	Ha rea ​​ka ra bua letho, ra ema.
You can make them real.	U ka li etsa tsa sebele.
They have children and you do not.	Ba na le bana mme wena ha o na.
It almost works.	E batla e sebetsa.
I try to do it right.	Ke leka ho e etsa hantle.
You know they like to shop.	Ua tseba hore ba rata ho reka.
Finally they gave us ours.	Qetellong ba ile ba re fa ea rōna.
Yes, you need to spend money this way.	E, o hloka ho sebelisa chelete ka mokhoa ona.
He wants to be helpful to you.	O rata ho ba thuso ho uena.
It could be.	Ho ka ba joalo.
I want only one.	Ke batla e le 'ngoe feela.
And of course there are many more.	'Me ho hlakile hore ho na le tse ling tse ngata.
He thought he was in trouble.	O ne a nahana hore o na le mathata.
He would not ask for help.	O ne a sa tlo kopa thuso.
He is an innocent man.	Ke monna ya se nang molato.
I will be happy to wait until it is time to leave.	Ke tla thabela ho ema ho fihlela nako ea ho tsamaea e fihla.
They enjoy it.	Ba e thabela.
They want to make money.	Ba batla ho etsa chelete.
By chance.	Ka monyetla feela.
Then maybe we can talk to them about using that thing.	Joale mohlomong re ka bua le bona ka ho sebelisa ntho eo.
They want to see if you know what you are doing.	Ba batla ho bona hore na o tseba seo o se etsang.
This is a better option in my opinion.	Ona ke mokhoa o betere ho ea ka maikutlo a ka.
They spoke first and foremost.	Ba ile ba bua pele le pele.
You would not believe it.	U ne u ke ke ua e lumela.
It was missing.	E ne e le sieo.
If it did, start another one.	Haeba e entse, qala e 'ngoe.
It's pretty good.	E ntle hantle.
You can pass me by.	O ka feta ho nna.
I have met that before.	Ke kopane le seo pele.
And they don't seem to care.	'Me ho bonahala eka ha ba tsotelle.
One of my favorite things.	E 'ngoe ea lintho tseo ke li ratang haholo.
I was still crying, and he never tried to talk to me.	Ke ne ke ntse ke lla, ’me ha aa ka a leka ho bua le ’na.
But thank you for reading.	Empa kea leboha ha u bala.
But each time we came out stronger.	Empa nako le nako re ne re tsoa re le matla.
It was time to do it again.	E ne e le nako ya ho e etsa hape.
However, they all say nice things about food.	Leha ho le joalo, bohle ba bua lintho tse monate ka lijo.
My life is not important to all of this.	Bophelo ba ka ha bo na bohlokoa ho tsena tsohle.
I will do it.	Ke tla e etsa.
He is a great man.	O monna e moholo.
Do we have enough water?	Na re na le metsi a lekaneng?
I mean this is the only thing they can do.	Ke bolela hore sena ke sona feela seo ba ka se etsang.
They are good things, but they are just things.	Ke lintho tse ntle, empa ke lintho feela.
A little more.	Ho feta hanyane.
But it is better to have something as good as you.	Empa ho molemo ho ba le ntho e ntle joalo ka uena.
That is what he would do.	Ke seo a neng a tla se etsa.
Or in any case, of course.	Kapa ka mokhoa ofe kapa ofe, ka sebele.
They did it all.	Ba e entse kaofela.
We had just met.	Re ne re sa tsoa kopana.
You ask more than many.	U botsa ho feta tse ngata.
What a man is, he lives.	Seo motho a leng sona, sea mo phela.
Each of us felt.	E mong le e mong oa rona o ile a ikutloa.
I do not know that many people have the same feelings.	Ha ke tsebe hore batho ba bangata ba na le maikutlo a tšoanang.
The first is to get out.	Ea pele ke ho tsoa.
We'll just let him go.	Re tla mo tlohela feela.
Long before my time.	Khale pele ho nako ea ka.
I'm not sure why.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na hobaneng.
We have no money.	Ha re na chelete ea letho.
He was gone.	O ne a ile.
Of course you did not find him.	Ke 'nete hore ha ua mo fumana.
But that should be a good place to start for you.	Empa seo e lokela ho ba sebaka se setle sa ho qala ho uena.
However, it does not matter.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho na taba.
I think it was very good.	Ke nahana hore e ne e le ntle haholo.
It looks very nice.	E shebahala e le ntle haholo.
I asked him why.	Ke ile ka mo botsa lebaka.
What would you do there.	O ne o ka etsang moo.
Now, it seems.	Joale, ho bonahala.
It's hard to believe you're still alive.	Ho thata ho lumela hore u ntse u phela.
Obviously, that did not go well.	Ho hlakile hore seo ha sea tsamaea hantle hakaalo.
He spoke and did nothing.	A bua mme a etsa letho.
They did not want it, but they were strong.	Ba ne ba se batle, empa ba ne ba le matla.
It began to think more carefully.	E ile ea qala ho nahana ka hloko haholoanyane.
Both of them seemed to work.	Ho bona ka bobeli ho ne ho bonahala ho sebetsa.
He asked if he could speak to us.	O ile a botsa hore na a ka bua le rōna.
You will just have to enjoy watching them.	U tla tlameha feela ho thabela ho li sheba.
These people are talking about something else.	Batho bana ba bua ka ntho e 'ngoe.
That's all they want to talk about.	Ke sohle seo ba batlang ho bua ka sona.
They certainly had power.	Ka sebele ba ne ba e-na le matla.
I wanted to thank each and every one of you for your time today.	Ke ne ke batla ho leboha e mong le e mong oa lona ka nako ea lona kajeno.
No one should believe this place.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho lumela sebaka sena.
It was not a good idea.	E ne e se maikutlo hantle.
I can do nothing for you.	Nke ke ka u etsetsa letho.
As they meet you will have to use your hands.	Ha e ntse e kopana u tla tlameha ho sebelisa matsoho a hau.
He eventually returned to school.	Qetellong o ile a khutlela sekolong.
And my dog ​​will have to love him.	'Me ntja ea ka e tla tlameha ho mo rata.
It really wasn't that good then.	Ehlile e ne e se ntle hakaalo ka nako eo.
The coffee was delicious.	Kofi e ne e le monate.
Sorry to hear about your wife.	Ke masoabi ho utloa ka mosali oa hau.
Some were still wearing work clothes.	Ba bang ba ne ba ntse ba apere liaparo tsa mosebetsi.
We too noticed.	Le rōna re ile ra hlokomela.
I cry a lot.	Ke lla haholo.
Staying.	Ho lula.
But he refused to dwell on anything so bad.	Empa o ile a hana ho lula a nahana ka ntho leha e le efe e mpe hakaalo.
If you don't do that, you're doing the wrong thing.	Ha o sa etse jwalo, o etsa ntho e phoso.
I think he is still a very good player.	Ke nahana hore e ntse e le sebapali se setle haholo.
Several times, maybe.	Ka makhetlo a 'maloa, mohlomong.
They walked along the road, exhausted.	Ba ile ba tsamaea ka tsela, ba khathetse.
I knew it was going to happen.	Ke ne ke tseba hore e tla ba teng.
It was just a bad thing.	E ne e le ntho e mpe feela.
And no, you can't come.	'Me che, u ke ke ua tla.
I started looking.	Ke ile ka qala ho sheba.
But you have to go.	Empa u tlameha ho tsamaea.
Only if it was night.	Feela haeba e ne e le bosiu.
But sometimes that doesn't help.	Empa ka linako tse ling ha ho na thuso.
You did not know more.	O ne o sa tsebe ho feta.
If it helps, have it.	Haeba e thusa, e-ba le eona.
What it needs now is help.	Seo e se hlokang hona joale ke thuso.
This coffee is very tasty.	Kofi ena e monate haholo.
I had children.	Ke ne ke e-na le bana.
Or well, almost nothing.	Kapa hantle, hoo e ka bang ha ho letho.
It is more important than practice.	Ho bohlokoa ho feta ho etsa.
It would pass.	E ne e tla feta.
I thought about it.	Ke ile ka nahana ka eona.
It is important to be good at your job.	Ho bohlokoa ho ba hantle mosebetsing oa hau.
Now is my time.	Joale ke nako ea ka.
After you, things will be as they are.	Ka mor'a hao, lintho li tla ba kamoo li tla ba kateng.
This is certainly the case.	Ka sebele sena se joalo.
But no one could say that he knew.	Empa ha ho motho ea neng a ka bolela hore o tseba hantle.
Neither should we.	Le rōna ha rea ​​lokela ho etsa joalo.
No one knew where he went.	Ho ne ho se motho ya tsebang moo a ileng teng.
Where he lived and what he was driving.	Moo a neng a lula teng le hore na o ne a khanna eng.
I have no money to pay you.	Ha ke na chelete ea ho u lefa.
I don't care what he said.	Ha ke tsotelle seo a se buileng.
But that is not the reason we did so.	Empa ha se lebaka leo re entseng joalo.
He didn't want problems, really.	O ne a sa batle mathata, ruri.
It wasn't me.	E ne e se nna.
He was able to play very well.	O ne a khona ho bapala hantle haholo.
I wear it on the back.	Ke e apara morao.
He was a boy.	E ne e le moshanyana.
He did not find anything recently.	Ha a ka a fumana letho haufinyane.
And that didn't work.	Le seo ha se a ka sa sebetsa.
Moreover he was a very good player.	Ho feta moo e ne e le sebapali se hloahloa haholo.
That made it easier to watch.	Seo se ile sa etsa hore ho be bonolo ho shebella.
He had a good feeling for all of us.	O ne a e-na le maikutlo a monate bakeng sa rona bohle.
Just a comment.	Maikutlo feela.
He stayed there for a while.	A dula moo nako e itseng.
That's nothing.	Seo hase ntho.
In fact, he really enjoyed it.	Ha e le hantle, o ne a e thabela haholo.
And he knows it.	Mme e a e tseba.
A good book is a good book.	Buka e ntle ke buka e ntle.
Your wife and children are with you.	Mosali oa hao le bana ba na le uena.
People can talk.	Batho ba ka bua.
The letter arrived in the evening.	Lengolo leo le ile la fihla mantsiboea.
He will not come home.	A ke ke a tla hae.
I have to catch it all.	Ke lokela ho le tšoara kaofela.
He loved it so much.	O ne a e rata haholo.
Sometimes, too much.	Ka linako tse ling, e ngata haholo.
This is a real thing.	Ena ke ntho ea sebele.
Now it's a good police job.	Hona joale ke mosebetsi o motle oa mapolesa.
I've had people buy these things from me before.	Ke kile ka ba le batho ba reka lintho tsena ho 'na pele.
So it did its job there.	Kahoo e ile ea etsa mosebetsi oa eona moo.
He left for several days.	O ile a tsamaea matsatsi a ’maloa.
He is a very dangerous man.	Ke motho ea kotsi haholo.
You did it a few years ago.	U e entse lilemo tse 'maloa tse fetileng.
And there are still some things to look forward to.	'Me ho ntse ho e-na le tse ling tseo u lokelang ho li lebella.
I'm so glad you didn't.	Ke thabile haholo hore ebe ha ua etsa joalo.
He said it was too late.	A re nako e se e le morao haholo.
The same is true for other days.	Ho joalo ka matsatsi a mang.
He just wants to be sure.	O mpa a batla ho ba le bonnete.
As it should be, of course, in time.	Joalo ka ha ho tlameha ho ba joalo, ehlile, ka nako.
And she is doing well.	Mme o etsa hantle.
This is not the way it should work.	Sena ha se tsela eo e lokelang ho sebetsa ka eona.
Your feedback is very important to us.	Maikutlo a hau a bohlokoa haholo ho rona.
They stand outside.	Ba ema ka ntle.
Do something instead of thinking about it.	Etsa ho hong ho e-na le ho nahana ka eona.
This seemed very important.	Sena se ne se bonahala se le bohlokoa haholo.
A little more, please?	Ho feta hanyane, ka kopo?
I will enjoy watching.	Ke tla thabela ho shebella.
But everyone knows it.	Empa bohle ba e tseba.
I'm almost three years old.	Ke batla ke le lilemo li tharo.
No doctor will do that.	Ha ho ngaka e tla etsa joalo.
Thank you for this.	Kea leboha ka sena.
He could do nothing now.	O ne a ka se etse letho jwale.
She loves to learn.	O rata ho ithuta.
I will keep you !.	Ke tla u boloka!.
This as a child is already happening.	Sena ke sa le ngoana se se se ntse se etsahala.
But he did not care.	Empa o ne a sa tsotelle.
Getting there was difficult.	Ho fihla moo ho ne ho le thata.
As long as everyone plays the same way.	Ha feela bohle ba bapala ka tsela e tšoanang.
Of course,	Ha e le hantle,
He asked some important questions.	O ile a botsa lipotso tsa bohlokoa.
That thing is very old.	Ntho eo ke ea khale haholo.
It's very simple.	Ke bonolo haholo.
There is such a thing.	Ho na le ntho e joalo.
I thought you might enjoy seeing him.	Ke ne ke nahana hore u ka thabela ho mo bona.
In fact, they do nothing.	Ha e le hantle, ha ba etse letho.
So, we may not talk about it.	Kahoo, re ka 'na ra se ke ra bua ka eona.
I'm going back to school.	Ke khutlela sekolong.
This is not the way this should go.	Sena ha se tsela eo sena se lokelang ho tsamaea ka eona.
He sat back and let us do our thing.	O ile a lula ka morao 'me a re lumella ho etsa lintho tsa rona.
I think it really hurts.	Ke nahana hore e hlile e bohloko.
That you saw this through me.	Hore o bone sena ka nna.
You are very important to me.	O bohlokoa haholo ho nna.
Anything can happen.	Ho ka etsahala eng kapa eng.
That would be fine.	Hoo ho ka ba hantle.
There is no reason to doubt it now.	Ha ho lebaka leo a lokelang ho e belaela hona joale.
One was arrested.	Ho ile ha tšoaroa e le 'ngoe.
Still very fun.	Leha ho le joalo o monate haholo.
And this is exactly what is happening.	'Me sena ke sona se etsahalang hantle.
He did not expect to win.	O ne a sa lebella hore o tla hlola.
Why don't you have it all?	Ke hobane'ng ha u se na eona kaofela?
Not much.	E seng haholo.
It had to get worse.	E ne e lokela ho ba mpe le ho feta.
He did what he was told to do.	O ile a etsa seo a neng a re a se etse.
He declined to comment.	O ile a hana ho fana ka maikutlo.
It was one thing too much.	E ne e le ntho e le 'ngoe e ngata haholo.
Or you don't have to.	Kapa ha ua tlameha.
The pain was excruciating.	Bohloko bo ne bo le matla.
Shortly thereafter, the man came out.	Kapele ka mor’a moo, monna eo o ile a tsoa.
All of these things began to happen.	Lintho tsena tsohle li ile tsa qala ho etsahala.
However, you get the idea.	Leha ho le joalo, u fumana mohopolo.
Money is useless.	Chelete ha e na thuso.
It made my day.	E entse letsatsi la ka.
It may take time to do so.	Ho ka 'na ha nka nako ho etsa joalo.
I don't know what it was.	Ha ke tsebe hore na e ne e le eng.
So that's how you have that kind of money.	Kahoo ke hore na u na le chelete ea mofuta oo .
If we could go, we could go, but we can't.	Haeba re ne re ka tsamaea, re ne re ka tsamaea, empa re ke ke ra khona.
That was where he was.	E ne e le moo a neng a le teng.
He often helped others.	Hangata o ne a thusa ba bang.
There was no reason to.	Ho ne ho se na lebaka la ho.
Everything he wore he had made.	Tsohle tseo a neng a li apara o ne a li entse.
I let her think so.	Ke ile ka mo lumella hore a nahane joalo.
Down to earth.	Motho oa 'nete.
He is leaving this morning.	O tsamaea hoseng hona.
Party goes, whatever.	Mokete oa tsamaea, eng kapa eng.
It is a job creation.	Ke tlhahiso ea mosebetsi.
He had to get out.	O ile a tlameha ho tsoa.
Now, you know better than to do that.	Jwale, o tseba betere ho feta ho etsa seo.
We tried not to know them.	Re ile ra leka hore re se ke ra ba tseba.
So that’s where you have it folks.	Kahoo ke moo u nang le eona batho.
It won't take long now.	E ke ke ea nka nako e telele joale.
Ho a.	Ho a.
Stop just talking.	Tlohela ho bua feela.
It's just too much.	Ke ntho e ngata haholo feela.
Then she began to think about her son.	Eaba o qala ho nahana ka mora oa hae.
My mother does not seem to mind.	'Mè o bonahala a se na bothata.
I need to know more.	Ke hloka ho tseba haholoanyane.
There was no one else visible.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong ea neng a bonahala.
Eventually, you will realize all of that.	Qetellong, o tla hlokomela tseo tsohle.
And you will be happy to do so.	'Me u tla thabela ho etsa joalo.
You have had a wonderful life.	U bile le bophelo bo monate haholo.
They will do anything for you.	Ba tla u etsetsa eng kapa eng.
The night went on.	Bosiu bo ile ba tsoela pele.
Or a car.	Kapa koloi.
That is why we are here.	Ke kahoo re leng teng.
He probably knew that the girl was not his.	Mohlomong o ne a tseba hore ngoanana eo ha se oa hae.
I have not received it yet.	Ha ke so e fumane.
He plays fast.	O bapala kapele.
That is my question to you.	Ke potso ea ka ho uena.
And it happens again and again.	Mme e etsahala hape le hape le hape.
He offered his place.	O ile a fana ka sebaka sa hae.
I found a way.	Ke bone tsela.
I have to walk.	Ke tlameha ho tsamaea ka maoto.
We find that to be true.	Re fumana hore ehlile ho joalo.
It's so fun to see them.	Ho monate haholo ho bona.
It has a function.	E na le mosebetsi.
The same is true of our life.	Ho joalo le ka bophelo ba rōna.
He wanted to know where it could be.	O ne a batla ho tseba moo e ka bang teng.
Because of the baby, he had to leave.	Ka lebaka la ngoana, o ile a tlameha ho tsamaea.
I would definitely do this for people.	Ruri ke ne ke tla etsetsa batho sena.
ho.	ho.
He asked for it.	O ile a e kopa.
And the strange feeling was in me.	Mme maikutlo a makatsang a ne a le ho nna .
I saw what made my family.	Ke ile ka bona seo se ileng sa etsa lelapa la ka.
It has existed before.	E bile teng pele.
So, they try again.	Kahoo, ba leka hape.
But I can't find it.	Empa ha ke e fumane.
Obviously, none of them lived here.	Ho hlakile hore ha ho le ea mong oa bona ea neng a lula mona.
The ride was difficult.	Ho palama ho ne ho le boima.
But today do not refuse me.	Empa kajeno u se ke ua hana ho 'na.
New because we make it the way we want it.	E ncha hobane re e etsa ka tsela eo re e batlang.
They're talking about.	Ba ntse ba bua ka.
If it were true, he would probably be telling the truth.	Haeba e ne e le 'nete, e ka 'na eaba o bua 'nete.
We can do it in the future.	Re ka e etsa nakong e tlang.
His bike is an important factor.	Baesekele ea hae ke ntho ea bohlokoa.
But that is the way it is.	Empa ho joalo ka tsela.
We called our parents.	Re ile ra letsetsa batsoali ba rōna.
Of course, that did not happen.	Ho hlakile hore seo ha sea etsahala.
We tried to play and did.	Re ile ra leka ho bapala 'me ra etsa joalo.
And that was the best.	Mme seo e ne e le se molemo ka ho fetisisa.
He said to us in the morning.	O ile a re hoseng.
If you allow them.	Haeba u ba lumella.
Thank you very much.	Ke leboha haholo.
And that went on for a very long time.	'Me seo se ile sa tsoela pele ka nako e telele haholo.
I hope I can help.	Ke tšepa hore nka thusa.
No one told me about it.	Ha ho motho ea ileng a mpolella ka eona.
And yet, that's right, too.	Mme leha ho le jwalo, ho jwalo, hape.
This seems important for a reason.	Sena se bonahala se le bohlokoa ka lebaka le itseng.
They have not liked it for a long time.	E se e le nako e telele ba sa e rate.
Thanks for this question.	Kea leboha ka potso ena.
In the morning and before bed.	Hoseng le pele o robala.
Often it is because they like the idea of ​​helping someone else.	Hangata ke hobane ba rata maikutlo a ho thusa motho e mong.
I don’t think there is anything we can do about it.	Ha ke nahane hore ho na le seo re ka se etsang ka hona.
However, he did not stay long.	Leha ho le joalo, ha aa ka a lula nako e telele.
That's the way it is.	Ke kamoo ho leng kateng.
It's that simple.	Ho bonolo joalo.
Say whatever you want to anyone you want.	Bolela eng kapa eng eo u e batlang ho mang kapa mang eo u mo batlang.
The sun had them both.	Letsatsi le ne le e-na le tsona ka bobeli.
I did not do it often.	Ke ne ke sa e etse hangata.
Probably no one does.	Mohlomong ha ho motho ea etsang joalo.
Your life now.	Bophelo ba hao jwale.
That’s what I love about him.	Ke eona ntho eo ke e ratang ka eena.
If he saw an opportunity, he wanted it.	Haeba a ne a bona monyetla, o ne a e batla.
Somehow it was too fast.	Ka tsela e itseng e ne e le kapele haholo.
He came up with an idea.	O ile a tla le mohopolo.
That's all and more.	Ke tsohle le ho feta.
They never left.	Ha ho mohla ba kileng ba tsamaea.
The fact is that people can get help while using it.	'Nete ke hore batho ba ka fumana thuso ha ba ntse ba sebelisa.
Maybe he had just started.	Mohlomong o ne a sa tsoa qala.
Look, that's not the point.	Sheba, ha se taba eo.
They're right here.	Ba teng mona hantle.
So it is not good to go on with it.	Kahoo ha ho molemo ho tsoela pele ka eona.
But he understood why he wanted to leave.	Empa o ne a utloisisa hore na ke hobane’ng ha a batla ho tsamaea.
Or with his parents.	Kapa le batsoali ba hae.
Try to understand people, things will happen.	Leka ho utloisisa batho, lintho li tla etsahala.
That is what a father would need to be.	Ke seo ho neng ho tla hlokahala ho ba ntate.
It's not easy, it really isn't.	Ha ho bonolo, ehlile ha ho joalo.
These are my favorite ones.	Tsena ke tseo ke li ratang haholo.
Energy, of course, is the first problem.	Matla, ehlile, ke bothata ba pele.
I like books of this type.	Ke rata libuka tsa mofuta ona.
Your money is useless today.	Chelete ea hau ha e na thuso kajeno.
He started again.	O ile a qala hape.
She is about to cry.	O se a tla lla.
I've heard it many times.	Ke e utloile hangata.
He goes home.	O ea hae.
I have an idea for you.	Ke na le maikutlo ho uena.
That was a good idea.	Eo e ne e le mohopolo o motle.
It was great to have a family.	Ho ne ho le monate ho ba le lelapa.
He thought so strangely.	O ne a nahana joalo ka mokhoa o makatsang.
It looks like a beautiful place.	E shebahala joaloka sebaka se setle.
I know he will.	Kea tseba hore o tla etsa joalo.
He claims to know these people.	O bolela hore o tseba batho bana.
He continued to speak.	A tsoela pele ho bua.
He never got it.	Ha A eso e fumane.
Our clothes are for everyone, every day.	Liaparo tsa rona ke tsa motho e mong le e mong, letsatsi le letsatsi.
He always had time for his children.	O ne a lula a e-na le nako ea bana ba hae.
They love you.	Ba u rata.
You have no money.	Ha u na chelete.
I have no way of knowing.	Ha ke na mokhoa oa ho tseba.
It's a very strange thing.	Ke ntho e makatsang haholo.
I live here now.	Ke lula mona hona joale.
He wondered what else he could use.	A ipotsa hore na a ka sebelisa eng hape.
Even if they can.	Leha ba ka khona.
I do not know why.	Ha ke tsebe hore na hobaneng ho le joalo.
There was no one else in the area.	Ho ne ho se motho e mong sebakeng seo.
They have spent their lives helping others.	Ba qetile bophelo ba bona ba thusa ba bang.
Last night.	Bosiu ba maobane.
Wait until you get home, when you are alone.	Ema ho fihlela u fihla hae, ha u le mong.
It's just more dangerous.	Ke kotsi feela ho feta.
We take nothing here.	Ha re nke letho mona.
But that would not happen.	Empa seo se ne se ke ke sa etsahala.
I think that's going to happen.	Ke nahana hore ho tla etsahalang.
It means it doesn't matter.	E bolela hore ha e bohlokoa.
Moreover, it is not.	Ho feta moo, ha se .
It did not work that way.	Ha ea ka ea sebetsa joalo.
But sometimes there are.	Empa ka linako tse ling ho na le.
This is not surprising.	Sena ha se ntho e makatsang.
We can use your help in the restaurant.	Re ka sebelisa thuso ea hau ka ntlo ea lijo.
Three for your age.	Tse tharo tsa lilemo tsa hau.
Maybe it was from someone else.	Mohlomong e ne e tsoa ho motho e mong.
He loved his life.	O ile a rata bophelo ba hae.
Until she was gone for hours, she read a book.	Ho fihlela lihora tse telele a le sieo, o ile a bala buka.
Clothes really make a man.	Liaparo li hlile li etsa monna.
That makes it fun.	Seo se etsa hore ho be monate.
Or in a nearby area.	Kapa sebakeng se haufi.
I can work hard.	Nka sebetsa ka thata.
They believe in children.	Ba lumela ho bana.
It was so now.	Ho ne ho le jwalo jwale.
I did not ask him.	Ha kea ka ka mo botsa.
Suppose it was not so.	Nka hore ho ne ho se joalo.
Certainly his wife had not come here.	Ka sebele mosali oa hae o ne a sa tla mona.
He did not speak.	Ha a ka a bua.
We will defeat them.	Re tla ba hlola.
You have three days to get there.	U na le matsatsi a mararo ho fihla moo.
I went outside.	Ke ile ka tsoela ka ntle.
Yes, it works just fine.	E, e sebetsa hantle feela.
Or unless we have someone else.	Kapa ntle le haeba re na le motho e mong.
It should be fun !.	E lokela ho ba monate!.
I hope it will help you.	Ke tšepa hore e tla u thusa.
Riding now.	Ho palama hona joale.
He wants to know who that man is.	O batla ho tseba hore na monna eo ke mang.
When did people become like that?	Batho ba bile joalo neng.
Although they started it.	Leha ba ile ba e qala.
You know my law.	U tseba molao oa ka.
He did not know whether they were still alive.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na ba ntse ba phela.
I will say it one last time.	Ke tla e bua lekhetlo la ho qetela.
There was enough space for them.	Ho ne ho e-na le sebaka se lekaneng bakeng sa bona.
I really am.	Ke hlile ke.
And she was happy to think it that way.	Mme o ne a thabetse ho e nahana jwalo.
He refused.	O ile a hana.
Very good news.	Litaba tse monate haholo.
It turned out to be weird.	E ile ea e-ba ntho e makatsang.
They seemed to have a family.	Ba ne ba bonahala ba e-na le lelapa.
Some get it and some don't.	Ba bang baa e fumana mme ba bang ha ba e fumane.
Let them know what happened last night.	E re ba tsebe se etsahetseng bosiung ba maobane.
He will never return.	A ke ke a hlola a khutlela teng.
You just do.	U etsa feela.
Once the problems start, he is unable to move.	Hang ha mathata a qala, ha a khone ho tsamaea.
I was arrested.	Ke ile ka tšoaroa.
We wondered if that was the case, but no.	Re ile ra ipotsa hore na ho ne ho le joalo, empa che.
So, that was his time.	Kahoo, eo e ne e le nako ea hae.
Or sometimes it's a man.	Kapa ka linako tse ling ke monna.
You have such beautiful clothes.	U na le liaparo tse ntle joalo.
I was not sure if it worked.	Ke ne ke sena bonnete ba hore e sebetsa.
No, that's not what happened.	Che, ha se se etsahetseng.
But he did not say much.	Empa o ne a sa bue haholo.
Have a good one.	E-ba le e ntle.
Want to learn all about everything.	Batla ho ithuta tsohle ka tsohle.
It was time.	E ne e le nako.
And fun is of this nature.	'Me monate ke oa mofuta ona.
She wants to continue working and living a relatively simple life.	O batla ho tsoela pele a sebetsa le ho phela bophelo bo batlang bo le bonolo.
There will come a time when it will be better to have it.	Ho tla tla nako eo ka eona ho ka bang molemo ho ba le eona.
Maybe he doesn't know.	Mohlomong ha a tsebe.
Today it did not.	Kajeno ha ea ka ea etsa joalo.
I have not received a call yet.	Ha ke so fumane mohala hape.
You can forget and use it when it is available.	U ka lebala 'me ua e sebelisa ha a le teng.
Nothing else will do.	Ha ho letho le leng le tla etsa.
It maintains and works well.	E boloka le ho sebetsa hantle.
He left school one day and never returned.	O ile a tloha sekolong ka letsatsi le leng ’me ha aa ka a hlola a khutla.
It did not work well for me.	Ha ea ka ea sebetsa hantle bakeng sa ka.
He was a simple and very strange dog.	E ne e le ntja e bonolo le e makatsang haholo.
And this is the most important.	'Me sena ke sa bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
That there is nothing wrong with that.	Hore ha ho letho le phoso.
Their child.	Ngoana oa bona.
Then they drove away.	Eaba ba tsamaea ka koloi.
It got really bad.	E ile ea e-ba mpe haholo.
I have a problem here.	Ke na le bothata mona.
He did not take long to stand up.	Ha a ka a nka nako e telele ho ema.
The things he said.	Lintho tseo a li buileng.
It is already night.	E se e le bosiu.
Sometimes it’s time to go.	Ka linako tse ling ke nako ea ho tsamaea.
With all you have.	Ka tsohle tseo o nang le tsona.
Only, it was not his.	Feela, e ne e se ea hae.
We looked but could not find it.	Re ile ra sheba empa ha rea ​​ka ra e fumana.
But family is good.	Empa lelapa le molemo.
It gave him time to think.	E ile ea mo fa nako ea ho nahana.
I think you know that.	Ke nahana hore o tseba seo.
It is usually a very pleasant time.	Hangata ke nako e monate haholo.
He suspects that the problem must be somewhere else.	O belaela hore e tlameha ebe bothata bo sebakeng se seng.
That will do.	Seo se tla etsa.
He knew so many people.	O ne a tseba batho ba bangata haholo.
Time is money.	Nako ke chelete.
So what do they get ?.	Joale ba fumana eng?.
She is always late for school.	O lula a le morao sekolong.
I have a few things I need to buy right now.	Ke na le lintho tse 'maloa tseo ke lokelang ho li reka hona joale.
No one knew him, or what he had done.	Ho ne ho se ya mo tsebang, kapa seo a se entseng.
I just had no place.	Ke ne ke se na sebaka feela.
I did not catch them.	Ha kea ka ka li tšoara.
You do not know what you are doing or what you should do.	Ha u tsebe seo u se etsang kapa seo u lokelang ho se etsa.
He says no.	O re che.
I was traveling with a woman.	Ke ne ke tsamaea le mosali.
It was one of a kind.	E ne e le e mong oa mofuta.
It really did exist.	Ho ne ho hlile ho le teng.
So talk about it.	Kahoo e bue.
We are certainly happy to have you.	Ka sebele re thabile ha u le teng.
It seems to have its own mind.	E bonahala e na le kelello ea eona.
It was really good.	E bile hantle ruri.
People wanted to hear what he had to say.	Batho ba ne ba batla ho utloa maikutlo a hae haholoanyane.
Imagine how things are going now.	Nahana hore na lintho li tsamaea joang hona joale.
I have them now.	Ke na le tsona hona joale.
I have questions about that.	Ke na le lipotso ka seo.
Anyone can beat anyone.	Mang kapa mang a ka hlola mang kapa mang.
Always talk about them.	Kamehla bua ka bona.
He never asked for anything.	Ha ho mohla a kileng a kopa letho.
I just heard good things about you.	Ke sa tsoa utloa lintho tse monate ka uena.
The group sang for hours.	Sehlopha se ile sa bina lihora tse ngata.
It hurts the most.	Ho bohloko ho feta tsohle.
Watch what you say.	Sheba seo u se buang.
But it is life.	Empa ke bophelo.
Take care of your subject!	Hlokomela taba ea hau!
But no one would take us.	Empa ho ne ho se motho ea neng a tla re nka.
Earlier, he had said something about the discovery of their belongings.	Pele ho moo, o ile a bua ho hong ka ho fumana lintho tsa bona.
It can be a fun day.	E ka ba letsatsi le monate.
I had nothing.	Ke ne ke se na letho.
This is not what you have.	Sena ha se seo u nang le sona.
That’s exactly what he looks like.	Eo ke hantle hore na o shebahala joang.
Her image has been very important to me.	Setšoantšo sa hae e bile sa bohlokoa haholo ho 'na.
Whatever happens, of course.	Eng kapa eng e tla etsahala, ka 'nete.
We finished it in three days.	Re e qetile ka matsatsi a mararo.
He told her he had to work late.	O ile a mo bolella hore o tlameha ho sebetsa ka mor'a nako.
It will be easy this way.	Ho tla ba bonolo ka tsela ena.
You and my dad need to get together.	Uena le ntate oa ka le lokela ho kopana.
The fact of the matter is that it was not an issue.	Taba ea sebele ke hore e ne e se taba.
We know who made it, too.	Re a tseba hore na ke mang ya e entseng, le rona.
He is very clear.	O hlakile haholo.
He just wanted me.	O ne a batla 'na feela.
There are a few things to keep in mind.	Ho na le lintho tse 'maloa tseo u lokelang ho li hlokomela.
It looks worse than it actually is.	E shebahala e le mpe ho feta kamoo e leng kateng.
Someone with a mind like his.	Motho ya nang le kelello e kang ya hae.
I'm going to tell them.	Ke ya ba bolella.
I still knew it well.	Ke ne ke ntse ke e tseba hantle.
It is easy to make money.	Ho bonolo ho fumana chelete.
No one really understood.	Ho ne ho se motho ea neng a utloisisa hantle.
What should we do today?	Re lokela ho etsa’ng kajeno?
The only way to grieve is to understand it.	Tsela feela ea ho utloa bohloko ke ho e utloisisa.
After eating, the girl went to bed.	Ka mor’a ho ja, ngoanana a ea robala.
That is.	Eo ke.
From here, you are alone.	Ho tloha mona, u se u le mong.
They are not as important as they used to be.	Ha ba sa le bohlokoa joaloka pele.
However, I did not keep it.	Leha ho le joalo, ha kea ka ka e boloka.
I think only of you.	Ke nahana ka uena feela.
It is useless, that is.	Ha ho na thuso, ke hore.
It doesn't have to be.	Ha ho hlokahale hore ho be teng.
I would love that.	Ke tla rata seo.
It was a bad decision and was about to end.	E ne e le qeto e mpe 'me e ne e le haufi le ho qetela.
I see things as they really are.	Ke bona lintho kamoo li leng kateng.
Of course, nothing came out.	Ha e le hantle, ha ho letho le ileng la tsoa.
He said he had not.	O ile a re ha a eso.
You will forget your past.	O tla lebala tsa hao tse fetileng.
I want to know what he knows.	Ke batla ho tseba seo a se tsebang.
Here, come in.	Mona, kena.
But he knew more than that.	Empa o ne a tseba hore ho feta moo.
He lives there now.	O lula moo hona joale.
I'll wait for you there.	Ke tla u lebella moo.
He did it well.	O e entse hantle.
We will have to leave soon.	Re tla tlameha ho tsamaea kapele.
But he wanted something.	Empa o ne a batla ho hong.
You know what, let's just say it is.	O ya tseba ke eng, ha re re ho jwalo.
But now I did not know.	Empa hona joale ke ne ke sa tsebe.
Everyone had something he did not say.	E mong le e mong o ne a e-na le seo a sa kang a se bua.
But that was not possible at the time.	Empa hoo e ne e se ntho e ka etsahalang ka nako eo.
It could have been that way before.	Ho ka be ho bile joalo pele.
He asked the man his name.	O ile a botsa monna eo lebitso la hae.
She looks like a beautiful child.	O shebahala joalo ka ngoana ea motle.
I will not write the same thing.	Ha ke na ho ngola ntho e tšoanang.
But just try to think of this, right.	Empa leka feela ho nahana ka sena, hantle.
This is a good thing.	Ena ke ntho e ntle.
It was a family.	E ne e le lelapa.
If you have longer than that.	Haeba u na le linako tse telele ho feta moo.
I do not want to know.	ha ke batle ho tseba.
In fact, it was just a room.	Ha e le hantle, e ne e le kamore feela.
It no longer stands.	Ha e sa ema.
I think it will be very good for us.	Ke nahana hore e tla ba molemo haholo ho rona.
It would be better to be his.	Ho ka ba molemo ho ba hae.
Then they go back to work.	Joale ba khutlela mosebetsing.
She slept to drink a man.	A robala ho noa monna.
Do not go out to meet them.	Le se ke la tsoa ho ea kopana le bona.
Only good stuff.	Lintho tse ntle feela.
Three problems with these.	Mathata a mararo ka tsena.
But if you try at all, you will learn it.	Empa ha u ka leka ho hang, u tla ithuta eona.
They really loved them.	Ba ne ba hlile ba ba rata.
It would never be enough.	E ne e ke ke ea hlola e lekana.
However.	Leha ho le joalo.
They will not live together at all.	Ba ke ke ba phela hammoho ho hang.
I am in my second year of high school.	Ke selemong sa bobeli sekolong se phahameng.
He took the high road.	A nka tsela e phahameng.
We had done it.	Re ne re e entse.
I just met you.	Ke sa tsoa kopana le uena.
He studied that subject carefully.	O ile a ithuta taba eo ka hloko.
Try to spend some time with my children.	Leka ho qeta nako e itseng le bana ba ka.
He looked carefully.	A sheba ka hloko.
One worker said that they all worked hard.	Mosebetsi e mong o ile a re bohle ba sebetsa ka thata.
My boy has no shoes.	Moshanyana oa ka ha a na lieta.
That is often the case.	Hangata ho joalo.
What kind of work do you think he is doing?	U nahana hore o etsa mosebetsi oa mofuta ofe?
Dad's bedroom.	Kamore ea ho robala ea Ntate.
Make sure you read it all.	Etsa bonnete ba hore u e bala kaofela.
Both and of.	Ka bobeli le ea.
His regular position was the first player.	Boemo ba hae ba kamehla e ne e le sebapali sa pele.
His house was here.	Ntlo ea hae e ne e le mona.
I'm not sure they have a name.	Ha ke na bonnete ba hore ba na le lebitso.
I was used to that now.	Ke ne ke se ke tloaetse seo hona joale.
I wondered where they came from.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na ba tsoa hokae.
That's not what we have here.	Ha se seo re nang le sona mona.
Walk carefully.	Tsamaea ka hloko.
I knew that well.	Ke ne ke tseba seo hantle.
It still exists.	E ntse e le teng.
And then you.	Mme ebe wena.
But it is worth a try.	Empa ho bohlokoa ho leka.
So it will not be our reason for living.	Kahoo e ke ke ea e-ba lebaka la rōna la ho phela.
That's where my mind was.	Ke hona moo kelello ea ka e neng e le teng.
My mother was gone.	’Mè o ne a ile.
Also, they are not very heavy objects.	Hape, ha se lintho tse boima haholo.
Is it weird?	Ke ntho e makatsang?
I have one simple rule of thumb to be in this type of work.	Ke na le molao o le mong o bonolo oa ho ba mosebetsing oa mofuta ona.
It still does not understand why we do it.	E ntse e sa utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha re e etsa.
And, you know, she's a mother.	Mme, le a tseba, ke mme.
I get them every day, sometimes more than once.	Ke li fumana letsatsi le letsatsi, ka linako tse ling ho feta hang.
Then he thought about it.	Eaba o nahana ka eona.
It should be fun to watch.	E lokela ho ba monate ho e shebella.
It could be, it is not.	E ka ba, ha ho joalo.
I just wanted to try it once.	Ke ne ke batla ho e leka hang feela.
I'm not sure.	Ha ke tsebe hantle.
You can even hear him do it.	U ka ba ua mo utloa ha a etsa.
You would not think.	O ka se nahane.
Maybe it would be a good thing.	Mohlomong e ka ba ntho e ntle.
It's nice to be here.	Ho monate ho ba mona.
They want to do their job.	Ba batla ho etsa mosebetsi oa bona.
He will make sure of that.	O tla etsa bonnete ba seo.
But more than that he always has almost nothing.	Empa ho feta mona o lula a batla a se na letho.
Sometimes that is true.	Ka linako tse ling ke ’nete.
It should be very fun.	E lokela ho ba monate haholo.
He was alone now.	O ne a le mong joale.
No one helped her.	Ha ho ea ileng a mo thusa.
We do well.	Re etsa hantle.
He is good at what he does.	O hloahloa ho seo a se etsang.
He was very happy.	O ne a thabile haholo.
I am going to seek help.	Ke il'o batla thuso.
You better go.	Ho molemo hore u tsamaee.
He said it was fun.	O ile a re ho ne ho le monate.
They can sing.	Ba ka bina.
We say that the man and the woman were alone before.	Re re monna le mosali ba ne ba le bang pele.
Often, often.	Hangata, hangata.
Sometimes even more so.	Ka linako tse ling le ho feta.
Everything he did was new.	Ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe eo a neng a e etsa e ne e le ncha.
I don't think it can.	Ha ke nahane hore e ka khona.
She was with her husband.	O ne a ena le monna wa hae.
He was in a bad way.	O ne a le ka tsela e mpe.
But he wanted to stop.	Empa o ne a batla ho ema.
We have to work harder.	Re tlameha ho sebetsa ka thata ho feta.
Now he wondered if they would return.	Joale o ne a ipotsa hore na ba tla khutla.
Tonight we had such a moment.	Bosiung bona re bile le nako e joalo.
We can go anywhere.	Re ka ea kae kapa kae.
After a long search, he finally found his parents.	Ka mor’a ho batla nako e telele, qetellong o ile a fumana batsoali ba hae.
I want everything you have.	Ke batla tsohle tseo o nang le tsona.
He soon learned the trade.	Kapele o ile a ithuta mosebetsi oo.
I suspect my wife would stay with me.	Ke belaela hore mosali oa ka o ne a tla lula le 'na.
Of course, we have to meet.	Ehlile, re tlameha ho kopana.
No problem, of course.	Ha ho bothata, ka 'nete.
They ate at the end of the season.	Ba ne ba ja qetellong ea nako.
Everything except for nothing, strangely enough.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe ntle le letho, ka mokhoa o makatsang.
The process is simple.	Mokhoa ona o bonolo.
Do not tell her what she was thinking the first time.	U se ke ua mo bolella seo a neng a se nahana lekhetlo la pele.
We decided to buy a house.	Re ile ra etsa qeto ea ho reka ntlo.
We love this place.	Re rata sebaka sena.
Otherwise, it is better to hold.	Ho seng joalo, ho molemo ho tšoara.
Your parents will never know.	Batsoali ba hao ba ke ke ba tseba.
I can do that now.	Nka etsa seo hona jwale.
It stopped and started again.	Ya ema mme ya qala hape.
Note, please.	Hlokomela, ka kopo.
As a result, .	Kahoo, .
Anyway I would tell you this week.	Leha ho le joalo ke ne ke tla u bolella bekeng ena.
His way in was the only way out.	Tsela ea hae ea ho kena e ne e le eona feela tsela ea ho tsoa.
He just knew it was going to be a police car.	O ne a tseba feela hore e tla ba koloi ea mapolesa.
Do something new.	Etsa ntho e ncha.
That was very important to her.	Seo e ne e le sa bohlokoa haholo ho eena.
She will be just fine.	O tla phela hantle feela.
My mother was the strongest.	'Mè e ne e le eena ea matla.
I am a teacher.	Ke tichere.
Your place is very nice.	Sebaka sa hau se setle haholo.
Others will not do anything for you.	Ba bang ba ke ke ba u etsetsa letho.
I didn't want to make him talk more than he wanted to.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho etsa hore a bue ho feta kamoo a neng a batla kateng.
Very well.	Hantle haholo.
What people do and why.	Seo batho ba se etsang le hobaneng.
He did not know what would happen.	O ne a sa tsebe se tla etsahala.
He could not ask his friends to go with him.	O ne a sitoa ho kopa metsoalle ea hae hore e tsamaee le eena.
I could not continue.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho tsoela pele.
Some of us will pass.	Ba bang ba rona ba tla feta.
You understand.	Ua utloisisa.
I'm working on that.	Ke ntse ke sebetsa ho seo.
I'm happy for you.	Ke o thabetse.
I really was useless to them now.	Ka sebele ke ne ke se na thuso ho bona joale.
You know where it is.	U tseba moo e leng teng.
She used to be beautiful.	O kile a ba motle.
I know the place.	Ke tseba sebaka seo.
I started reading.	Ke ile ka qala ho bala.
That's right.	Ke 'nete.
Then you can see how important the problems are.	Joale u ka bona hore na mathata a bohlokoa hakae.
He needs to have some work to do.	Hoa hlokahala hore a be le mosebetsi o itseng oo a lokelang ho o etsa.
I could.	Ke ne nka khona.
Do not cry.	Le se ke la lla.
My son needs a dog.	Mora oa ka o hloka ntja.
You have to get in there.	O lokela ho kena moo.
He wanted to ask her why.	O ne a batla ho mo botsa lebaka.
I just don't know.	Nka mpa ka se tsebe.
He was about to continue asking a question.	O ne a le haufi le ho tsoela pele ho botsa potso.
I do what my job requires.	Ke etsa seo mosebetsi oa ka o se hlokang.
We want to think this through.	Re batla ho nahana sena hantle.
And if they get it.	'Me haeba ba e fumana.
And he wanted more, too.	Mme o ne a batla ho feta, hape.
They are happening now.	Li ntse li etsahala hona joale.
However, there is something to it.	Leha ho le joalo, ho na le ho hong ho eona.
Great job.	Mosebetsi o moholo.
He did very well in school.	O ne a sebetsa hantle haholo sekolong.
The end time was near.	Nako ea ho qetela e ne e le haufi.
He will do just fine.	O tla etsa hantle feela.
However, his team did not feel that way.	Leha ho le joalo, sehlopha sa hae ha sea ka sa ikutloa joalo.
Good old thing.	Ntho e ntle ea khale.
They are looking for old antiques.	Ba batla lintho tsa khale tsa khale.
I think those are very important.	Ke nahana hore tseo li bohlokoa haholo.
He says he has a son.	O re o na le mora.
One of you.	E mong oa hau.
He didn't see how he could.	O ne a sa bone kamoo a ka khonang.
They had never met before.	Ba ne ba eso kopane pele.
That is what will keep us strong.	Ke eona ntho e tla re boloka re le matla.
Then he went on to school.	Eaba o tsoela pele ho ea sekolong.
Some things take longer.	Lintho tse ling li nka nako e telele.
He even knew the man's name.	O ne a bile a tseba le lebitso la monna eo.
This is where such ideas come in handy.	Mona ke moo maikutlo a joalo a bang kotsi.
Thanks for the help with this.	Ke leboha thuso ho sena.
Nothing, never.	Ha ho letho, le ka mohla.
Moreover, she is beautiful.	Ho feta moo, o motle.
He wanted to know where he was.	O ne a batla ho tseba hore na o hokae.
But that's the point.	Empa ke taba eo.
He would love to visit there.	A ka thabela ho etela moo.
Everyone will make way for you now.	E mong le e mong o tla u etsetsa tsela hona joale.
You can meet me.	O ka kopana le nna.
I think he did.	Ke nahana hore o ile a etsa joalo.
And people.	Le batho.
But there is a way.	Empa tsela e teng.
He was very good at it.	O ne a le motle haholo ka eona.
I just want to see them.	Ke batla ho ba bona feela.
Man will live.	Motho o tla phela.
One day, go for a walk.	Ka letsatsi le leng, tsamaea ho tsamaea.
I'm not that simple.	Ha ke bonolo hakaalo.
He didn't need another girl.	O ne a sa hloke ngoanana e mong.
He saved money.	O ile a boloka chelete.
Do not pretend that he did not.	U se ke ua etsa eka ha aa etsa joalo.
They did not stay that long.	Ha baa ka ba ema nako e telele hakaalo.
Moreover, no.	Ho feta moo, che.
I try to be a good person.	Ke leka ho ba motho ea molemo.
It can be a very long time.	E ka ba nako e telele haholo.
He has had a wonderful life here.	O bile le bophelo bo monate mona.
He left.	O ile a tloha.
Everyone's life is important.	Bophelo ba motho e mong le e mong bo bohlokoa.
Too much for sleeping.	E ngata haholo bakeng sa ho robala.
You can work anywhere.	O ka sebetsa kae kapa kae.
Find a new way.	Fumana tsela e ncha.
But the baby did not cry.	Empa ngoana ha aa ka a lla.
At the same time.	Ka nako e tšoanang.
I did not understand why this should be the case.	Ke ne ke sa utloisise hore na ke hobane'ng ha sena se lokela ho ba joalo.
Take a good look at the book.	Hlokomela buka eo hantle haholo.
However, this is a mistake.	Leha ho le joalo, sena ke phoso.
That doesn't seem enough to say thank you for that.	Ha ho bonahale ho lekana ho leboha seo.
They all want you.	Kaofela ba batla uena.
This is not a walking party.	Sena ha se mokete oa maoto.
They are easy to make and everyone loves them.	Li bonolo ho li etsa 'me bohle baa li rata.
What you are saying is not very interesting.	Seo u se buang ha se monate haholo.
He was doing just that.	O ne a ntse a etsa joalo.
Helping people when you are away for hours.	Ho thusa batho ha u le sieo lihora.
This is an amazing idea.	Ena ke mohopolo o makatsang.
I can do anything for you.	Nka u etsetsa eng kapa eng.
Have a great week !.	Eba le beke e monate!.
But no, it is not.	Empa che, ha se eona.
You know you are happy.	Ua tseba hore u thabile.
Everything in this room is wet.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe ka kamoreng ena e metsi.
You have to be better than ever.	O tlameha ho ba betere ho feta leha e le neng pele.
Find this place.	Batla sebaka sena.
He can sleep while we work.	O khona ho robala ha re ntse re sebetsa.
It was no longer his dog.	E ne e se e se ntja ea hae.
I'm not sure what to expect.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nka lebella eng.
I wanted to be strong.	Ke ne ke batla ho ba matla.
I think she must be very nice.	Ke nahana hore e tlameha ebe o motle haholo.
More than that again.	Ho feta moo hape.
He didn't do it, you know.	Ha a ka a e etsa, le a tseba.
He wanted to save.	O ne a batla ho boloka.
I will take care to correct him.	Ke tla hlokomela ho mo lokisa.
Maybe it would be nice if you could.	Mohlomong ho ka ba monate ha u ka khona.
I would see you.	Ke ne ke tla o bona.
It didn't seem to matter.	Ho ne ho bonahala ho se na taba.
Or, or call.	Kapa, ​​kapa letsetsa .
It was hard for me.	Ho ne ho le boima ho ’na.
I was no longer human	Ke ne ke se ke se motho
I made sure he didn’t know	Ke ile ka etsa bonnete ba hore ha a tsebe
I heard it happened here	Ke utloile hore ho etsahala mona
He could not just say everything.	O ne a sa khone ho bua ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe feela.
I do not need clothes.	Ha ke hloke liaparo.
I was just happy to find a dog	Ke ne ke thabile feela hore ebe re fumana ntja
I will save time.	Ke tla boloka nako.
We fit here.	Re lekana mona.
This is his favorite.	Ena ke eo a e ratang haholo.
I saw the man.	Ke bone monna eo.
But he was very much like that.	Empa o ne a le joalo haholo.
Always easy.	Kamehla ka bonolo.
I have to talk to you	Ke tlameha ho bua le wena
As they do.	Joalo ka ha ba etsa.
Traveling around the globe can be a daunting task	Ho tsamaea sebakeng seo ke ntho e makatsang
It is only by giving.	Ke ka ho fana feela.
And he would know.	Mme o ne a tla tseba.
I would not do such a thing to you	Ke ne nke ke ka u etsa letho le joalo
Yes, that is a possibility.	E, hoo ke ntho e ka etsahalang.
I pass here on my way to work	Ke feta mona ha ke ea mosebetsing
Then you decide to do it anyway.	Ebe u etsa qeto ea ho e etsa leha ho le joalo.
It's close but not too close.	E haufi empa e se haufi haholo.
What else can you think of?	Ke eng hape eo u ka e nahanang?
And it doesn't matter.	Mme ha ho na taba.
I was sweet and gentle	Ke ne ke le monate ke le bonolo
I really want you to get help	Ke hlile ke batla hore u fumane thuso
He said the place should have been empty.	O ile a re sebaka seo se ne se lokela ho se na letho.
I was not expecting anything from that	Ke ne ke sa lebella letho la seo
You can do the same again.	U ka etsa joalo hape.
She is just an older child.	Ke ngoana e moholo feela.
And it will be.	Mme ho tla ba jwalo.
I allow people to use it when they want to	Ke lumella batho ho e sebelisa ha ba batla
Meet your problems.	Kopana le mathata a hau.
I hear him say that.	Ke utloa a bua joalo.
I did not understand	Ke ne ke sa utloisise
I have nothing.	Ha ke na letho.
He would do nothing.	O ne a sa tlo etsa letho.
It was a painful thing to think about.	E ne e le ntho e bohloko ho e nahana.
I just wonder what it would be like	Ke nahana feela hore na ho ne ho tla ba joang
It's very difficult.	Ho ba thata haholo.
The same thing is happening today.	Hoa etsahala se tšoanang le kajeno.
I do not know why	Ha ke tsebe lebaka
I just want to keep it that way	Ke batla ho e boloka e le joalo feela
Now you have to stop.	Joale u tlameha ho ema.
They have to do it right.	Ba lokela ho e etsa hantle.
He may have said something to them.	Ho ka etsahala hore ebe o ile a bua ho hong ho bona.
I took advantage of it.	Ke ile ka nka monyetla ka eona.
These are not available anywhere.	Tsena ha li teng kae kapa kae.
I could not find him	Ke ne ke sa khone ho mo batla
You look good in it.	U shebahala hantle ho eona.
I knew everything about him	Ke ne ke tseba tsohle ka eena
Thank you!	Kea u leboha!
I too can be here as anywhere.	Le 'na nka ba mona joaloka kae kapa kae.
He never has anything good to do.	Ha ho mohla a nang le letho le molemo leo a ka le etsang.
I knew he was a real person	Ke ne ke tseba hore ke motho oa sebele
They have not found anything.	Ha ba eso fumane letho.
I mean, very well	Ke bolela hantle, hantle haholo
No, he did not.	Che, ha a ka a etsa joalo.
I saw it then and thought.	Ke e bone ka nako eo mme ka nahana.
I needed to hear something	Ke ne ke hloka ho utloa ho hong
Hold hands if you have to.	Tšoara matsoho haeba u tlameha.
I still do not.	Ke ntse ke sa etse joalo.
My mother did as she pleased.	’Mè o ile a etsa kamoo a ratang kateng.
So they set off on foot.	Kahoo ba tsamaea ka maoto.
Then again probably not.	Joale hape mohlomong ha ho joalo.
Maybe that's not a bad thing, he thought.	Mohlomong seo ha se ntho e mpe, a nahana joalo.
She would love to travel, and she would also love to stay.	A ka rata ho tsamaea, 'me hape a ka rata ho lula.
But this is an old book.	Empa ena ke buka ea khale.
I still do not know what it is	Ke ntse ke sa tsebe hore na ke eng
They found their reason.	Ba fumane lebaka la bona.
I will tell everyone else	Ke tla bolella ba bang kaofela
Second to last.	Ea bobeli ho ea ho qetela.
Outside it was very easy.	Ka ntle ho ne ho le bonolo haholo.
I will be alone.	Ke tla be ke le mong.
I need to know what's going on here	Ke hloka ho tseba hore na ho etsahalang mona
We heard nothing about it.	Ha rea ​​ka ra utloa letho ka eona.
We get to spend time together.	Re fumana ho qeta nako hammoho.
I didn’t realize I was this week	Ke ne ke sa hlokomela hore ke bekeng ena
Lots of news.	Litaba tse ngata.
That's a good thing, thank you.	Ke ntho e ntle, kea leboha.
I wanted to try not to think anything	Ke ne ke batla ho leka ho se nahane letho
But my mother did just that.	Empa ’Mè o ile a etsa joalo.
I'm so glad to find you looking so good	Ke thabile haholo ho o fumana o shebahala hantle hakana
Maybe he would meet someone.	Mohlomong o ne a tla kopana le motho.
If you make it easy, it will be better.	Haeba u etsa hore ho be bonolo, ho tla ba molemo.
I had to learn that, sometimes in a difficult way	Ke ne ke tlameha ho ithuta seo, ka linako tse ling ka tsela e boima
However, I do not know why that happens.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke tsebe hore na ke hobane'ng ha seo se etsahala.
I felt like crying.	Ke ne ke utloa eka ke lla.
I was already hurt enough	Ke ne ke se ke utloile bohloko ka ho lekaneng
It will be a player.	E tla ba sebapali.
I know everything that happens here	Ke tseba tsohle tse etsahalang mona
I just want to spend the day with you	Ke batla ho qeta letsatsi le uena feela
You must have friends.	U tlameha ho ba le metsoalle.
What happened last week, however, is not the way.	Se etsahetseng bekeng e fetileng, leha ho le joalo, ha se tsela.
I think he never talked about me	Ke nahana hore ha ho mohla a kileng a bua ka 'na
Professional at work.	Setsebi mosebetsing.
He does not want that life.	Ha a batle bophelo boo.
They cannot live together.	Li ke ke tsa phela hammoho.
He was learning as he walked.	O ne a ntse a ithuta ha a ntse a tsamaea.
But the room was not so nice.	Empa kamore eo e ne e se ntle hakaalo.
And you will certainly have done enough.	'Me ka sebele u tla be u entse ho lekaneng.
I was a party life	Ke ne ke le bophelo ba mokete
But he knew the real reason.	Empa o ne a tseba lebaka la sebele.
There was no way to preach.	Ho ne ho se mokhoa oa ho bolela.
I had to give first.	Ke ne ke lokela ho fana pele.
Well, one at a time.	Ke hantle, e mong ka nako.
You were just naked.	U ne u le feela.
I wish he had not asked	Ke lakatsa eka a ka be a sa ka a botsa
I can't go back to Dad	Ha ke khone ho khutlela ho Ntate
That's all it is.	Ke seo e leng sona feela.
He had many things to think about.	O ne a e-na le lintho tse ngata tseo a lokelang ho nahana ka tsona.
I found some things in him	Ke fumane lintho tse ling ho eena
The work of his hands.	Mosebetsi wa matsoho a hae.
I do not think of leaving him out here	Ha ke nahane ho mo tlohela ka ntle mona
I don’t think there is anything wrong with that.	Ha ke nahane hore ho na le phoso ka seo.
I need to see something	Ke hloka ho bona ho hong
He was not alone.	O ne a se mong.
You can move on with your life.	U ka tsoela pele ka bophelo ba hau.
Probably, if things go well.	Mohlomong, haeba lintho li tsamaea hantle.
Pleasure may not be a good thing.	Monate o ka 'na oa se ke oa ba taba hantle.
I did not find anything good.	Ha kea ka ka fumana letho le molemo.
However, he did not want this.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa batle sena.
Both for the same reason.	Ka bobeli ka lebaka le tšoanang.
He had legs.	O ne a na le maoto.
I donated most of our food	Ke ile ka fana ka lijo tsa rōna tse ngata
It's his mind.	Ke kelello ea hae.
That's a good thing.	Ke ntho e ntle.
But you must definitely go with us.	Empa ka sebele u tlameha ho tsamaea le rōna.
Or with anything for that matter.	Kapa ka ntho efe kapa efe bakeng sa taba eo.
He was very much alive	O ne a phela haholo
I know he wasn't.	Kea tseba hore o ne a se jwalo.
The best thing you can do is not meet at all.	Ntho e ntle ka ho fetisisa eo u e etsang ha e na ho kopana ho hang.
That is what we are.	Ke seo re leng sona.
We have no way out.	Ha re na tsela ea ho tsoa.
They say you really went to it.	Ba re ka 'nete le ile la ea ho eona.
I just talked to him	Ke sa tsoa bua le eena
It is a fun day today for some kids.	Ke letsatsi le monate kajeno ho bana ba bang.
I found nothing surprising	Ha kea ka ka fumana letho le makatsang
However, I did not think it would happen	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke sa nahane hore ho tla etsahala
He did not say where we were going.	Ha a ka a bolela hore na re ya kae.
But in reality it may not be.	Empa ha e le hantle ho ka 'na ha se ke ha e-ba joalo.
The fact is, most people are in trouble right now.	'Nete ke hore batho ba bangata ba na le mathata hona joale.
But, if not, then forget it.	Empa, haeba ho se joalo, joale lebala.
I want to talk about you	Ke batla ho bua ka wena
People will come to see.	Batho ba tla tla ho sheba.
Something that would not be here	Ntho e neng e ka se be teng mona
It is very easy to work alone.	Ho bonolo haholo ho sebetsa ke le mong.
This is too much.	Sena se ngata haholo.
Everything was new.	Lintho tsohle li ne li le ncha.
I thought it would be easy	Ke ne ke nahana hore ho tla ba bonolo
I have finished eating	Ke se ke qetile ho ja
Like him.	Joalo ka eena.
Yes, it will.	Ee, e tla tseba ka tsela e thata.
I was a little hurt, you know	Ke ile ka utloa bohloko hanyane, ua tseba
Also, it's hard for you.	Hape, ho thata ho uena.
You will learn and perhaps become a very important person.	U tla ithuta 'me mohlomong u be motho oa bohlokoa haholo.
No, we do not care.	Che, ha re tsotelle.
I learn quickly.	Ke ithuta kapele.
They do not think it is better.	Ha ba nahane hore ho molemo.
I would.	Ke ne nka.
Many of us were	Ba bangata ba rōna re ne re le joalo
I needed to understand this too	Ke ne ke hloka ho utloisisa sena le 'na
Or anyway.	Kapa leha ho le joalo.
And it's time.	Mme ke nako.
Of course he said yes.	Ehlile o ne a itse e.
Every issue is painful.	Taba e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe e bohloko.
I didn't see him standing there	Ha kea ka ka mo bona a emetse moo
He pays well.	O lefa hantle.
I could not doubt anything	Ke ne nke ke ka belaela letho
I have to tell the police about this.	Ke tlameha ho bolella mapolesa ka taba ena.
Thank you, but no.	Kea leboha, empa che.
He wanted to watch it again.	O ne a batla ho e shebella hape.
I did not know any better then	Ke ne ke sa tsebe betere ka nako eo
He knew exactly what to do.	O ne a tseba hantle seo a lokelang ho se etsa.
I really did not want to see her	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa batle ho mo bona
Sit down.	Lula fatše.
I did not know my father	Ke ne ke sa tsebe Ntate
What do you think we should do?	U nahana hore re lokela ho etsa joang?
All that matters is the situation and how you are doing there.	Sohle se bohlokoa ke boemo le hore na u etsa joang moo.
They hope he went home with someone.	Ba tšepa hore o ile a ea hae le motho.
I saw the police there	Ke bone mapolesa moo
It has always been so.	Esale ho le jwalo.
I can read people well	Ke khona ho bala batho hantle
Look at your picture.	Sheba setšoantšo sa hau.
I wonder if they are doing that now.	Kea ipotsa hore na ba ntse ba etsa joalo hona joale.
I would take any of them.	Ke ne ke tla nka leha e le efe ea tsona.
I did not want my mother to find her	Ke ne ke sa batle hore ’Mè a mo fumane
I need more hands.	Ke hloka matsoho a mang.
Stupid head.	Hlooho e hlokang kelello.
In this way, the two of us met for the first time.	Ka tsela ena, bobeli ba rōna re ile ra kopana ka lekhetlo la pele.
I'm not sure yet.	Ha ke e-so be le bonnete.
Then eat it.	Ebe u e ja.
I know this will probably never happen again	Kea tseba hore mohlomong sena se ke ke sa etsahala hape
Of course we would not think at all.	Ha e le hantle re ne re ke ke ra nahana ho hang.
I really needed information about him	Ke ne ke hloka litaba ka eena haholo
I have not received any money since	Ha ke so fumane chelete ho tloha ka nako eo
It really goes very fast.	Ehlile e tsamaea kapele haholo.
I didn’t want to watch this	Ke ne ke sa batle ho shebella sena
We are gentle children.	Re bana ba bonolo.
Nothing is more dangerous.	Ha ho letho le kotsi ho feta.
I will be here	Ke tla ba mona
I work with them every day	Ke sebetsa le bona letsatsi le letsatsi
I think so too.	Le 'na ke nahana joalo.
They refused to enter.	Ba ne ba hana ho kena.
I am the best !.	Ke molemo ka ho fetisisa!.
He is the only one.	Ke eena feela.
I didn't think he was hurt	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore o utloile bohloko
Let me think about it.	E re ke nahane ka eona.
It was so much fun	Ho ne ho le monate haholo
And that doesn't show.	Mme seo ha se bonahale.
I had a great time, thank you	Ke bile le nako e monate, kea leboha
I will definitely do it	Ka sebele ke tla e etsa
That doesn't matter.	Seo ha se na taba.
And therefore the most important.	'Me ka hona ea bohlokoa ka ho fetisisa.
I, too, love books.	Le 'na, ke rata libuka.
I do it hard.	Ke e etsa ka thata.
I didn’t have to tell anyone	Ke ne ke sa tlameha ho bolella motho
This is a good thing for me.	Sena ke ntho e ntle ho nna.
I always like to work at night	Ke lula ke rata ho sebetsa bosiu
He saw that he did not understand.	O ile a bona hore ha a utloisise.
Unless you have children.	Ntle le haeba u na le bana.
I think it works.	Ke nahana hore ea sebetsa.
It seems real.	Ho bonahala eka ke ntho ea sebele.
He needed to know.	O ne a lokela ho tseba.
So it makes it easier.	Kahoo e etsa hore e be bonolo.
I don’t even think he knew about that.	Ha ke nahane le hore o ne a tseba ka seo.
I was at his house	Ke bile ha hae
He discovered a number of things that may have been important.	O ile a fumana lintho tse ’maloa tseo e ka ’nang eaba li ne li le bohlokoa.
I doubt they will ever be there.	Ke belaela hore ba tla ke ba be teng.
Nobody liked to sleep.	Ho ne ho se motho ya ratang ho robala.
I could see that I was seeing.	Ke ne ke bona hore ke bona.
I'm not sure right now.	Ha ke na bonnete hona joale.
They say it and everything.	Ba e bua le tsohle.
I wonder where we are	Kea ipotsa hore na re hokae
Not so bad.	Ha se ntho e mpe hakaalo.
I took his hands in mine	Ke ile ka nka matsoho a hae ka a ka
This happens to one of them.	Sena se etsahala ho e mong oa bona.
I was always thinking of you	Ke ne ke lula ke nahana ka uena
He looked back.	A sheba morao.
Maybe it would help.	Mohlomong e ne e tla thusa.
I found this to be true.	Ke fumane sena e le ’nete.
Any help would be helpful, of course.	Thuso leha e le efe e ka ba molemo, ehlile.
I really enjoy having it	Ke thabela ho ba le lona haholo
We do not know what it was.	Ha re tsebe hore na e ne e le eng.
I could not stay with my team.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho lula le sehlopha sa ka.
I had a strange feeling	Ke ile ka ba le maikutlo a makatsang
I just needed to write down my thoughts	Ke ne ke hloka feela ho ngola maikutlo a ka
You may have heard about it.	E ka ’na eaba u utloile ka eona.
I may know.	Nka 'a' tseba.
I could sleep more	Ke ne ke khona ho robala haholoanyane
I don't think he exists.	Ha ke nahane hore o teng.
I only know where you are	Ke tseba feela moo o leng teng
I beg him to stay	Ke kopa hore a lule
I still love it.	Ke ntse ke e rata.
There seemed to be something he knew about her.	Ho ne ho bonahala eka ho na le ntho eo a e tsebang ka eena.
The power is there.	Matla a teng.
I have not seen you or seen you	Ha kea u bona le ho u bona
I just wanted to be with him	Ke ne ke rata ho ba le eena feela
It was not enough.	Ho ne ho sa lekana.
I do not want to know	Ha ke batle ho tseba
It is already speaking.	Ho ntse ho se ho bua.
That has to happen.	Seo se lokela ho etsahala.
I like to travel and do fun things.	Ke rata ho tsamaea le ho etsa lintho tse monate.
Moreover, it is very easy to use.	Ho feta moo, ho bonolo haholo ho e sebelisa.
Nobody needs you here.	Ha ho motho ea u hlokang mona.
I know that will take time	Kea tseba hore seo se tla nka nako
Just for me.	Ho 'na feela.
I did not know the car	Ke ne ke sa tsebe koloi
And even if you don’t.	'Me le haeba u sa etse joalo.
What more do you need?	U hloka eng hape?
Look and they knew it well.	Sheba 'me ba ne ba tseba hantle.
Although we do not see it.	Leha re sa e bone.
I just didn’t get in there for no reason.	Ha kea kena feela moo ntle ho lebaka.
I really didn't care	Ke ne ke hlile ke sa tsotelle
He said it was a good idea.	A re ke mohopolo o motle.
It was good to get back there again.	Ho ne ho le molemo ho khutlela moo hape.
However, it is not necessary.	Leha ho le joalo, ha ho hlokahale.
I was not sure what to do now	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na ke etse eng joale
But still, it is.	Empa leha ho le joalo, ho joalo.
I just wish it wasn't that long	Ke lakatsa feela hore ebe hase nako e telele hakaalo
I noticed something else	Ke ile ka hlokomela ntho e 'ngoe hape
Now in the first year.	Hona joale selemong sa pele.
Other than that, it didn't matter.	Ntle ho moo, e ne e se ea bohlokoa.
I think he was a man	Ke nahana hore e ne e le monna
My father stayed.	Ntate a lula.
I just walk away and they take him	Ke tsamaea feela ebe baa mo nka
I know you are getting help from someone else	Kea tseba hore o fumana thuso ho motho e mong
But he does not want to stay.	Empa ha a batle ho dula.
I really feel that way.	Ka sebele ke ikutloa joalo.
He feels important to me.	O ikutloa a le bohlokoa ho 'na.
You are so good that you do not have what you want.	O motle haholo hore ha o na seo o se batlang.
I don't like it right now	Ha ke e rate hona joale
I think he was hurt	Ke nahana hore o ne a utloile bohloko
I will travel a lot	Ke tla tsamaea haholo
There is something wrong.	Ho na le phoso moo.
The children noticed first.	Bana ba ile ba hlokomela pele.
Instead, she nodded.	Ho e-na le hoo, o ile a lumela ka hlooho.
I still do not.	Ke ntse ke sa etse joalo.
I think it is here.	Ke nahana hore e teng mona.
It’s kind of important.	Ke mofuta oa bohlokoa.
No, they will not.	Che, ba ke ke ba khona.
I found out that they were no longer there	Ke ile ka fumana hore ha ba sa le eo
Either way, you will win.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe, o tla hlola.
I knew it was time to leave	Ke ne ke tseba hore ke nako ea hore ke tsamaee
But then, it was worth it.	Empa ka nako eo, ho ne ho le molemo.
Maybe to the girl it was.	Mohlomong ho ngoanana e ne e le.
Be it good or bad.	E be e ntle kapa e mpe.
I stopped, but it was too late	Ke ile ka ema, empa e ne e se e le morao haholo
I really wanted to get out of the bedroom.	Ke ne ke hlile ke batla ho tsoa ka kamoreng ea ho robala.
We felt very happy about ourselves.	Re ile ra ikutloa re thabile haholo ka rona.
It is easier than ever to give and say.	Ho bonolo ho feta leha e le neng pele ho fana le ho bua.
We are in space.	Re sebakeng.
Yet they have it all.	Leha ho le joalo ba na le tsohle.
He is a simple, sweet dog with a wonderful sense of humor.	Ke ntja e bonolo, e monate e nang le maikutlo a makatsang.
You may realize that, too.	O ka nna wa hlokomela seo, le wena.
I got dressed and went to see her	Ke ile ka apara eaba kea tsamaea ho ea mo bona
I was finally living my life	Qetellong ke ne ke phela bophelo ba ka
I was able to open them and study them	Ke ile ka khona ho li bula le ho ithuta tsona
I wonder if now is the time to ask.	Kea ipotsa hore na joale ke nako ea ho botsa.
He was the head of the family.	E ne e le hlooho ea lelapa.
I don't care about anything	Ha ke tsotelle letho ka letho
You usually do not have to do anything.	Hangata ha ho hlokahale hore u etse letho.
It is not such a thing.	Ha se ntho e joalo.
Maybe I'm not strong	Mohlomong ha ke na matla
Mine does not have that.	Ea ka ha e na seo.
We give everyone a chance to speak.	Re fa bohle monyetla oa ho bua.
I used to be him and he will soon be me.	Ke ne ke kile ka ba eena 'me haufinyane e tla ba' na.
The front bedroom in the front room	Kamore ea ho robala e ka pele ka kamoreng e ka pele
I was neither a doctor nor an adult	Ke ne ke se ngaka kapa ke se ke se moholo
She did not know what to expect.	O ne a sa tsebe hore na a ka lebella eng.
It was a very difficult book	E ne e le buka e thata haholo
What exactly do you want.	U batla eng hantle.
He doesn't see that.	Ha a bone seo.
I want to get out of here	Ke batla ho tloha mona
However, get out if you want.	Leha ho le joalo, tsoa ha u batla.
It could have been.	E ka be e bile eona.
I loved you sometimes	Ke ne ke u rata ka nako e 'ngoe
She is so beautiful.	O motle ruri.
I would be going with my wife	Ke ne ke tla be ke tsamaea le mosali oa ka
The time came, the time passed.	Nako ya fihla, nako ya feta.
So, do not even try.	Kahoo, u se ke ua ba ua leka.
By then you will be feeling much better.	Ka nako eo u tla be u ikutloa u le betere haholo.
I was making a baby	Ke ne ke etsa ngoana
I didn’t think he would understand	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore o tla utloisisa
It's because there was nothing.	Ke hobane ho ne ho se na letho.
Look, if you really want to do it you can.	Sheba, haeba u hlile u batla ho e etsa u ka khona.
You know what you look like.	Ua tseba hore na u shebahala joang.
But often it is no longer my style.	Empa hangata ha e sa le mokhoa oa ka.
We never heard from him again.	Ha rea ​​ka ra hlola re utloa letho ka eena.
I went there today, but no one was home	Ke ile moo kajeno, empa ho ne ho se motho hae
He needs your help now.	O hloka thuso ea hau hona joale.
It could be.	E ne e ka ba .
We request at any time.	Re kopa ka nako efe kapa efe.
He did, and in what way.	O entse, mme ka tsela efe.
I see it even from here	Ke e bona le ho tloha mona
But he also spoke of other things.	Empa o ile a bua le lintho tse ling.
I even began to wonder if you were a real person	Ke ne ke bile ke qala ho ipotsa hore na u motho oa sebele
Or maybe it was the other way around.	Kapa mohlomong e ne e le ka tsela e ’ngoe.
You will not understand it.	U ke ke ua e utloisisa.
I really needed help	Ke ne ke hlile ke hloka thuso
No one needs to know.	Ha ho motho ea lokelang ho tseba.
I told her all about you	Ke ile ka mo bolella tsohle ka uena
But it is a thought.	Empa ke mohopolo.
Not good.	Ha e ntle.
There is a long way to go.	Ho na le tsela e telele ea ho tsamaea.
But if not.	Empa haeba ha ho joalo.
So think hard.	Kahoo nahana haholo.
But he has it, because of its importance.	Empa o na le eona, ka lebaka la bohlokoa ba eona.
Just do these things.	Etsa lintho tsena feela.
They would come if they could.	Ba ne ba tla tla ha ba ne ba ka khona.
I have to fix things	Ke tlameha ho lokisa lintho
I was not sure what he did now	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na o entse eng joale
He doesn't want to do this, either.	Ha a batle ho etsa sena, le hona.
But they did not come.	Empa ha baa ka ba tla.
That gives you a chance to win.	Seo se o fa monyetla oa ho hlola.
I hope they buy our cause	Ke tšepa hore ba tla reka lebaka la rona
I can't be alone with him	Ha ke khone ho ba mong le eena
I had no idea at all	Ke ne ke sa nahana ho hang
This is not an opportunity.	Sena ha se monyetla.
I would like to know what happened in the past.	Ke kopa ho tseba se etsahetseng nakong e fetileng.
I know who you are, and it is not you who is speaking	Kea tseba hore na u mang, 'me ha se uena ea buang
I considered him a family.	Ke ne ke mo nka e le lelapa.
It was his first book	E ne e le buka ea hae ea pele
The time to do something came unexpectedly.	Nako ea ho etsa ntho e itseng e ile ea fihla re sa lebella.
He is wearing his first clothes.	O apere liaparo tsa hae tsa pele.
However, you will get a job.	Leha ho le joalo, u tla fumana mosebetsi.
I told him no last week.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore che bekeng e fetileng.
I want to know if it works	Ke batla ho tseba hore na e ea sebetsa
I really wonder what will happen next.	Ruri kea ipotsa hore na ho tla etsahala’ng ka mor’a moo.
I want to help you	Ke batla ho o thusa
I have to do it, otherwise you will get back to work	Ke tlameha ho etsa joalo, ho seng joalo o tla fihla morao mosebetsing
Or it could be a place.	Kapa e ka ba sebaka.
He is still there.	O ntse a le teng.
I was trying to be good	Ke ne ke leka ho ba molemo
This is good.	Sena se setle.
We all know who you are talking about.	Kaofela rea ​​tseba hore na u bua ka mang.
But he was still learning.	Empa o ne a ntse a ithuta.
I had to work harder	Ke ne ke lokela ho sebetsa ka thata ho feta
It was after that.	E ne e le ka mor'a moo.
I did just that.	Ke ile ka etsa joalo.
You know this now.	O tseba sena jwale.
In both cases.	Ho lona bobeli.
I agreed to do so	Ke ile ka lumela ho etsa joalo
Every day there was something.	Letsatsi le letsatsi ho ne ho na le ntho e itseng.
I could be better off with him now.	Nka ba molemo ho eena hona joale.
That makes things a lot easier.	Seo se etsa hore lintho li be bonolo haholo.
It was his, to do as he pleased.	E ne e le wa hae, ho etsa ka moo a ratang ka teng.
I was expecting problems	Ke ne ke lebeletse mathata
Or he was, in any way.	Kapa o ne a le joalo, ka mokhoa ofe kapa ofe.
No need to hear.	Ha ho hlokahale ho utloa.
I feel like these things aren’t that important	Ke utloa eka lintho tsena ha li bohlokoa hakaalo
I'm not the one to talk to.	Ha se 'na eo u lokelang ho bua le eena.
I can't wait until tomorrow	Ha ke khone ho ema ho fihlela hosane
Please consider what you are saying.	Ke kopa o nahane ka seo o se buang.
I have to understand what this means	Ke tlameha ho utloisisa hore na sena se bolela eng
I did not make him do it	Ha kea etsa hore a e etse
But here's the good news.	Empa litaba tse monate ke tsena.
I hope you find something	Ke tšepa hore o tla fumana ho hong
But a new reality continues.	Empa 'nete e ncha e ntse e tsoela pele.
I'm almost as happy as you	Ke batla ke thabile joalo ka uena
I did not have that time	Ke ne ke sena nako eo
And the dog would see it.	Mme ntja e ne e tla e bona.
I could not deny that	Ke ne nke ke ka hana taba eo
You have to get out of them.	O tlameha ho tsoa ho bona.
I made some amazing friends	Ke ile ka ba le metsoalle e makatsang
It was just amazing.	E ne e mpa e le ntho e makatsang.
I wondered what he saw.	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na o bona eng.
I can't cry about it	Ha ke khone ho lla ka eona
I did not even see him.	Ha kea ka ka mo bona le ho mo bona.
But, they pay.	Empa, ba lefa.
I did not ask what was going on	Ha kea ka ka botsa hore na ho etsahalang
I hope you will fix it soon	Ke tšepa hore o tla e lokisa haufinyane
Except for you and me.	Ntle le nna le wena.
I hope he will come.	Ke tšepa hore o tla tla.
I usually do not talk about it.	Ke tloaetse ho se bue ka eona.
I am useless at all	Ha ke na thuso ho hang
You may not find it.	U ka 'na ua se ke ua e fumana.
He just wanted to see it.	O ne a mpa a batla ho o bona.
They were not children.	E ne e se bana.
I just couldn't let go of him	Ke ne ke sa khone ho mo tlohela feela
You have to give what you have.	U tlameha ho fana ka seo u nang le sona.
I loved the way he walked	Ke ne ke rata tsela eo a neng a tsamaea ka eona
But we live with it.	Empa re phela le eona.
I have become accustomed to writing a lot	Ke se ke tloaetse ho ngola haholo
I saw why that happens.	Ke ile ka bona lebaka leo ka lona ho etsahalang joalo.
I do not see.	Ha ke bone.
Every stop was a thought.	Ho ema ho hong le ho hong e ne e le mohopolo.
I am very happy.	Ke thabile haholo.
See, she's beautiful.	Le a bona, o motle.
I do not know where the problem lies.	Ha ke tsebe moo bothata bo leng teng.
I was very close.	Ke ne ke le haufi haholo.
I wanted you to know what was going on	Ke ne ke batla hore o tsebe se etsahalang
But we need not be that way.	Empa ha rea ​​lokela ho ba joalo.
The car was not so bad.	Koloi e ne e se mpe hakaalo.
I don't understand anything about it	Ha ke utloisise letho ka eona
These items do not exist.	Lintho tsena ha li eo.
I told them I was right there.	Ke ile ka ba bolella hore ke eo hona moo.
You have no power.	Ha o na matla.
But more than that.	Empa ho feta moo.
You know things.	U tseba lintho.
I thought after what he had said	Ke ile ka nahana ka morao ho seo a se buileng
As he says.	Joalo ka ha a bolela.
You know what will happen if you do not.	U tseba se tla etsahala ha u sa etse joalo.
I want to see my team again.	Ke batla ho bona sehlopha sa ka hape.
I see that happening	Ke bona seo se etsahala
I didn't like to talk about it.	Ke ne ke sa rate ho bua ka eona.
I should not say house	Ha kea lokela ho re ntlo
And that wasn't enough.	Mme hoo ho ne ho sa lekana.
I knew what they were going to do	Ke ne ke tseba hore na ba il’o etsa’ng
And then they'll just let it go.	Mme ebe ba tla e tlohela feela.
I think he is doing well	Ke nahana hore o ntse a sebetsa hantle
It's really nothing.	Ha se letho ruri.
I'm glad you did	Ke thabetse hore ebe u e entse
Often, he wondered why he had not even thought about it.	Hangata, o ne a ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha a ne a e-s'o nahane ka eona.
That, of course, would not be necessary.	Seo, ehlile, se ke ke sa hlokahala.
I opened my hands to her	Ke ile ka bula matsoho a ka ho eena
It seems like a lifetime.	Ho bonahala eka ke bophelo bohle.
I love money.	Ke rata chelete.
And that would not be good.	Mme hoo ho ka se be molemo.
It was so much fun for me.	Ho ne ho le monate haholo ho nna.
Which is something he would do.	E leng ntho eo a neng a tla e etsa.
Everyone was enjoying the meal very much.	Batho bohle ba ne ba thabetse lijo tseo haholo.
Thank you so much for both of you.	Ke leboha haholo ka bobeli ba lona.
I never do that.	Le ka mohla ha ke etse joalo.
Or he may have been.	Kapa o kile a ba joalo.
The important thing is that you feel together at the moment.	Ntho ea bohlokoa ke hore u ikutloa u le hammoho nakong ea hona joale.
I had a great week.	Ke bile le beke e monate.
I'm sure everything can work.	Ke na le bonnete ba hore tsohle li ka sebetsa.
I have that issue.	Ke na le taba eo.
I did not expect that	Ke ne ke sa lebella seo
I didn’t like when everyone knew	Ke ne ke sa rate ha bohle ba tseba
However, I wished he could do that.	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke lakatsa eka a ka etsa joalo.
He did not try to party.	Ha aa ka a leka moketeng.
These are old-fashioned.	Tsena ke tsa khale.
It's really beautiful.	E ntle ruri.
He told me to do it again.	O ile a mpolella hore ke e etse hape.
I had nothing to do	Ke ne ke se na letho leo nka le etsang
This does not need to be.	Sena ha se hloke ho ba joalo.
I mean look at the situation.	Ke bolela ho sheba boemo.
I took the opportunity to look at him	Ke ile ka sebelisa monyetla oo ho mo sheba
Of course, the danger was still there.	Ha e le hantle, kotsi e ne e ntse e le teng.
I have more intelligence than that	Ke na le kelello ho feta moo
And people will not give it to you.	'Me batho ba ke ke ba u fa eona.
I was just wondering what was going on.	Ke ne ke ntse ke botsa hore na ho etsahalang.
It certainly would.	Ka sebele ho ne ho tla ba joalo.
You have no sense in me.	Ha u na kelello ho 'na.
He just liked that.	O ne a rata seo feela.
I know him, and you know him.	Ke a mo tseba, le lona le a mo tseba.
You can't keep going.	U ke ke ua tsoela pele ho tsamaea.
I wanted to try it once.	Ke ne ke batla ho e leka hang.
We had coffee.	Re ile ra noa kofi.
Planning to leave school.	Ho rera ho tloha sekolong.
Thanks again for coming.	Ke leboha hape ka ho tla.
I do what he wants me to do	Ke etsa seo a se batlang
Will you be able to get yours.	Na u tla khona ho fumana ea hau.
I thought only of him	Ke ne ke nahana ka eena feela
Life was good.	Bophelo bo ne bo le monate.
You can still hear him well	U ntse u ka mo utloa hantle
I am very sad.	Ke utloile bohloko haholo.
You could do anything with your life.	O ne o ka etsa eng kapa eng ka bophelo ba hao.
I hope someone is there	Ke tšepa hore ho na le motho moo
They both decided it was time to leave.	Ka bobeli ba ile ba etsa qeto ea hore ke nako ea ho tsamaea.
Real guy.	Mohlankana wa sebele.
More about us than they are.	Ho feta ka rona ho feta bona.
Very fond of.	Ho rata haholo.
I will not give you anything you want.	Nke ke ka u fa letho leo u le batlang.
We fear the bad.	Re tšaba tse mpe.
I wondered why there was nothing	Ke ne ke ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha ho ne ho se na letho
I think all of you are fun	Ke nahana hore kaofela ha lona le monate
We have it all here.	Re na le tsohle mona.
I do not know how to fix this error.	Ha ke tsebe ho lokisa phoso ena.
Thank you so much for what you said	Ke leboha haholo ka seo o se buileng
And he can stay there.	Mme a ka dula moo.
I saw him once.	Ke ile ka mo bona hang.
He understood that.	O ne a utloisisa seo.
I would appreciate it if you could.	Ke tla leboha ha o ka etsa joalo.
This was not my case.	Sena e ne e se taba ea ka.
But people do not seem to be doing that.	Empa ho bonahala batho ba sa etse joalo.
I also enjoy working with my team	Hape ke thabela ho sebetsa le sehlopha sa ka
They do what they need to win.	Ba etsa seo ba se hlokang ho hlola.
He needed time to think, to know how to proceed.	O ne a hloka nako ea ho nahana, ho tseba hore na a ka tsoela pele joang.
They went to school with them	Ba ne ba kena sekolo le bona
I took more.	Ke ile ka nka ho feta.
Real people live and work in them.	Batho ba sebele ba phela le ho sebetsa ho tsona.
But we had one.	Empa re ne re e-na le e mong.
After using it, she found that it really works.	Ka mor'a ho e sebelisa, e fumane hore e hlile e sebetsa.
I did not tell him everything	Ha kea ka ka mo bolella ntho e ’ngoe le e ’ngoe
If you do not have it, you want it too bad.	Haeba u se na eona, u e batla e le mpe haholo.
I could get a car and go to school	Ke ne ke khona ho fumana koloi ebe ke ea sekolong
Maybe I don't know today	Mohlomong ha ke tsebe kajeno
They began to wonder why.	Ba ile ba qala ho ipotsa hore na ke hobane’ng.
I would like to see you very much	Ke lakatsa ho u bona haholo
I want to fix everything	Ke batla ho lokisa tsohle
Think again about this	Nahana hape ka sena
So now the car is working.	Kahoo hona joale koloi e se e sebetsa.
Now, things look good.	Hona joale, lintho li shebahala hantle.
I can help you if you need anything	Nka u thusa haeba u hloka eng kapa eng
Once he opened it, his condition would become apparent.	Hang ha a bula, boemo ba hae bo ne bo tla bonahala.
You still have to get there.	U ntse u tlameha ho fihla moo.
I think that's my way	Ke nahana hore ke tsela ea ka
He will never get what he wants.	Ha ho mohla a tla fumana seo a se batlang.
A few hours from time to time.	Lihora tse 'maloa nako le nako.
This is true.	Sena ke 'nete.
That's what he said.	Ke seo a se buileng.
Now he was not so sure.	Joale o ne a se na bonnete hakaalo.
You did not know he was there.	O ne o sa tsebe hore o teng.
I want you to know him	Ke batla hore le mo tsebe
It's your life.	Ke bophelo ba hao.
Check back each week for more.	Sheba hape beke e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe bakeng sa tse ling.
I use ours really	Ke sebelisa ea rona ehlile
But questions keep coming.	Empa lipotso li ntse li tla.
I should not have asked you now	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho o botsa hona jwale
Both of your stories were very powerful.	Litaba tsa hau ka bobeli li ne li le matla haholo.
He is too busy for his problems.	O phathahane haholo bakeng sa mathata a hae.
It speaks of fun.	E bua ka monate.
We'll see if they get it.	Re tla bona hore na le bona baa e fumana.
They even take some food.	Ba bile ba nka lijo tse ling.
I should not talk about it.	Ha kea lokela ho bua ka eona.
I did not always want children	Ke ne ke sa batle bana kamehla
I ask if he has anything else	Ke botsa hore na o na le ho hong hape
However, it can be difficult at times.	Leha ho le joalo, ho ka ba thata ka linako tse ling.
Maybe you do not understand it.	Mohlomong ha u e utloisise.
But you may not always be able to do that.	Empa u ke ke ua khona ho etsa joalo kamehla.
This should take a certain approach.	Sena se lokela ho nka tsela e itseng.
That's right.	Ke 'nete.
We were already too late.	Re ne re se re le morao haholo.
I feel alone	Ke ikutloa ke le mong feela
You never think before.	Ha ho mohla u nahanang esale pele.
However, I did not say no	Leha ho le joalo, ha kea ka ka re ha ho na monyetla
I could not drive.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho khanna.
My type, or his type.	Mofuta wa ka, kapa mofuta wa hae.
I would like to help you	Ke kopa ho u thusa
I have to think a lot about this	Ke tlameha ho nahana haholo ka sena
And it would be.	Mme ho ne ho tla ba jwalo.
I want it all, children	Ke e batla kaofela, bana
But this is not the place for it.	Empa sena ha se sebaka sa eona.
One is what he did.	E mong ke seo a se entseng.
They will want to know where you were.	Ba tla batla ho tseba moo o neng o le teng.
To think he has problems.	Ho nahana hore o na le mathata.
Just like in my life.	Joalo ka bophelo ba ka hantle.
Is there anything good going to happen.	Na ho na le ntho e ntle e tla etsahala.
Staying here can be amazing.	Ho lula mona e ka ba ntho e makatsang.
Surely that is a good reason.	Ruri ke lebaka le molemo.
Comments are still missing.	Maikutlo a ntse a le sieo.
I looked at the picture for a long time.	Ke ile ka sheba setšoantšo nako e telele.
I did not expect that soon.	Ke ne ke sa lebella kapele hakaalo.
You need to know him.	O lokela ho mo tseba.
So you can buy it.	Kahoo u ka e reka.
Everyone had lots of toys.	E mong le e mong o ne a e-na le lintho tsa ho bapala tse ngata.
I repeatedly asked for help	Ke ile ka u kopa ka makhetlo hore u fumane thuso
I looked down nicely	Ke ile ka sheba fatše hantle
I thought he might think of leaving	Ke ne ke nahana hore a ka ’na a nahana ho tsamaea
I think it was obvious	Ke nahana hore ho ne ho hlakile
It should not be an issue, really.	Ha ea lokela ho ba taba, ka 'nete.
I mean, they used to be	Ke bolela, ba kile ba ba jwalo
My start time was hard.	Nako ea ka ea ho qala e ne e le boima.
As you know.	Joalo ka ha u tseba.
I couldn’t think of that again	Ke ne ke sa khone ho nahana ka seo hape
You didn't have to come.	O ne o sa tlameha ho tla.
It was amazing.	E ne e le ntho e makatsang.
I'm not sure how long	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na nako e kae
Yes, and something else.	E, le ntho e 'ngoe hape.
Because they love them.	Hobane baa ba rata.
I think it has always been human	Ke nahana hore haesale batho e le batho
But no one is coming for me.	Empa ha ho motho ea tlang bakeng sa ka.
So it is true.	Kahoo ke 'nete.
Instead, is it not? 	Ho e-na le hoo, na ha ho joalo?
I see what he would see in you	Ke bona seo a neng a tla se bona ho wena
You buy a new car.	U reka koloi e ncha.
So our return will begin.	Kahoo ho khutla ha rona ho tla qala.
And if you feel guilty, do not do that.	'Me haeba u ikutloa u le molato, u se ke ua etsa joalo.
I thought I was a mother	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke mme
I can't say anything	Ha ke khone ho bua letho
You were happy.	U ne u thabile.
And certainly food for thought.	'Me ka sebele lijo tsa ho nahana.
None of us.	Ha ho le ea mong oa rona.
He is a husband and father	Ke monna le ntate
His place of power.	Sebaka sa hae sa matla.
That is what he was most afraid of.	Ke sona seo a neng a se tšaba haholo.
I live here.	Ke lula mona.
I want to be there for her when she hears	Ke batla ho ba teng bakeng sa hae ha a utloa
I wanted to be a doctor	Ke ne ke batla ho ba ngaka
You heard him.	U mo utloile.
I will start planning in advance	Ke tla qala ho rera esale pele
You need to memorize it by now.	O lokela ho e tseba ka hlooho hona joale.
I asked them not to do that	Ke ile ka ba kōpa hore ba se ke ba etsa joalo
I could not give him what he wanted	Ke ne ke sa khone ho mo fa seo a se batlang
He had not been in contact with her for years so he decided to call her.	E ne e se e le lilemo a sa kopane kahoo a etsa qeto ea hore o tla letsetsa.
Maybe he saw something he shouldn't have.	Mohlomong o bone ntho eo a sa lokelang ho ba le eona.
I can't say anything.	Ha ke khone ho bua letho.
I wonder what they like best.	Kea ipotsa hore na ba rata eng ka ho fetisisa.
I thought you might like them	Ke ne ke nahana hore u ka ba rata
He needed something more powerful.	O ne a hloka ntho e ’ngoe e matla haholoanyane.
Several people ate, but most simply drank	Batho ba ’maloa ba ile ba ja, empa ba bangata ba ne ba noa feela
You cannot be sure.	O ka se be le bonnete.
But someone has to do it.	Empa ho na le motho ea lokelang ho e etsa.
He still did not know why.	Le joale o ne a sa tsebe hantle hore na ke hobane'ng.
There was nobody anywhere.	Ho ne ho se motho kae kapa kae.
Not good.	Ha e ntle.
I'm right about that.	Ke hantle ka seo.
I tried to catch him, but he fell	Ke ile ka leka ho mo tšoara, empa a oa
I have a few questions.	Ke na le lipotso tse 'maloa.
There were many here, and he would soon have more.	Ho ne ho e-na le tse ngata mona, 'me haufinyane o ne a tla ba le tse ling.
I still have my food book.	Ke ntse ke e-na le buka ea ka ea lijo.
Their father.	Ntate oa bona.
I should not have gone	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho ea
I can't talk about this call	Ha ke khone ho bua ka mohala ona
He just looked at her.	A mo sheba feela.
I doubt, but probably	Ke belaela, empa mohlomong
It is a feeling that he is thinking the same thing.	Ke maikutlo a hore o ntse a nahana ntho e tšoanang.
Well, if you have to go, go.	Hantle, haeba u tlameha ho tsamaea, u tsamaee.
I needed to be with him	Ke ne ke hloka ho ba le eena
I asked him to come and meet you	Ke ile ka mo kopa hore a tl'o kopana le uena
And so it was.	Mme ho bile jwalo.
There is nothing that can surprise us.	Ha ho letho moo le ka re makatsang.
It is important to me.	Ke ea bohlokoa ho 'na.
No, he did not say anything.	Che, ha a ka a bua letho.
I asked them where they were going to stay	Ke ile ka ba botsa hore na ba il’o lula hokae
He had no idea.	O ne a sena maikutlo.
I let everyone tell me anything they wanted me to know.	Ke ne ke lumella bohle ho mpolella eng kapa eng eo ba batlang hore ke e tsebe.
I never understood it	ha ke e-so e utloisise
This does not seem to be very difficult to understand.	Sena ha se bonahale se le thata haholo ho ka se utloisisa.
I will never do this again.	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke etsa sena.
I looked at the first application	Ke ile ka sheba kopo ea pele
It was just a matter of talking, and time.	E ne e le taba feela ea ho bua, le nako.
He knew who he was.	O ne a tseba hore ke mang.
It will happen.	Ho tla etsahala.
This is not a good place to be.	Sena ha se sebaka se setle ho ba teng.
We often forget this.	Hangata re lebala sena.
I see you understand	Kea bona hore ua utloisisa
It's a beautiful place.	Ke sebaka se setle.
Either way, there is only one way to find out.	Ka tsela efe kapa efe, ho na le mokhoa o le mong feela oa ho tseba.
But he does not say anything.	Empa ha a bue letho.
I wanted to make sure you were not with him	Ke ne ke batla ho etsa bonnete ba hore ha u na le eena
Yes, it will.	E, ho tla ba joalo.
I say it all.	Ke bua tsohle.
That's a name.	Ke lebitso.
And others, too.	Le ba bang, hape.
He wanted nothing.	O ne a sa batle letho.
I really like it here	Ke e rata haholo mona
I watch it all the time	Ke e shebella ka linako tsohle
I think he was talking about something	Ke nahana hore o ne a bua ka ntho e itseng
Yes, even today, children do not know what is there.	E, le kajeno, bana ha ba tsebe se teng moo.
We will be close to that.	Re tla be re le haufi le moo.
I was not sure if you had ever been here	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle hore na u kile ua ba teng mona
Instead, they are human.	Ho e-na le hoo, ke batho feela.
I thought of the house	Ke ile ka nahana ka ntlo
The problem is that they do.	Bothata ke hore ba etsa joalo.
He thought about it a lot.	O ile a e nahana haholo.
It has always been, and always will be.	Haesale ho le jwalo, mme ho tla dula ho le jwalo.
We had an idea of ​​what things would be like.	Re ne re e-na le maikutlo a hore na lintho li tla ba joang.
This is my style.	Ena ke mokhoa oa ka.
However, I knew that Dad needed to make things right	Leha ho le joalo, ke ne ke tseba hore Ntate o lokela ho lokisa taba ena
I have to give you this	Ke tlameha ho o fa sena
They were regular people	E ne e le batho ba kamehla
I know about it all.	Ke tseba ka taba eo kaofela.
Easy to read.	Ho bala ha bonolo.
Anyway, I love it.	Leha ho le joalo, kea e rata.
I look forward to talking to you tomorrow	Ke lebeletse ho bua le uena hosane
Their parents help them with everything they can.	Batsoali ba bona ba ba thusa ka sohle seo ba ka se khonang.
I just have to be myself	Ke tlameha ho ba 'na feela
Take the money.	Nka chelete.
It will not be my first time.	E ke ke ea e-ba lekhetlo la ka la pele.
How you take it is up to you.	Hore na o e nka joang ho ho uena.
I will make sure you look good	Ke tla etsa bonnete ba hore u shebahala hantle
He knows we did.	Oa tseba hore re entse joalo.
I didn't know how to do it	Ke ne ke sa tsebe ho e etsa
I want you here with me	Ke o batla mona le nna
Yes, it must be.	E, e tlameha ebe ke eena.
I had become accustomed to suffering	Ke ne ke se ke tloaetse ho utloa bohloko
But she could not feel that way.	Empa o ne a sa khone ho ikutloa ka tsela eo.
Like you.	Joalo ka uena.
You must go on.	E tlameha ebe u tsoela pele.
I was the only one there	Ke ne ke le mong feela moo
I had a condition.	Ke ne ke na le boemo.
Go for work.	Tsamaea bakeng sa mosebetsi.
I have had it for many years	Ke bile le eona ka lilemo tse ngata
I'm not sure if that was really the case.	Ha ke tsebe hantle hore na e ne e hlile e le molemo oa bothata.
I did not know which one	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ke efe
No one has a problem.	Ha ho motho ea nang le bothata.
I felt like such a girl	Ke ne ke ikutloa joaloka ngoanana ea joalo
By then he would have done whatever he asked.	Ka nako eo o ne a tla be a entse eng kapa eng eo a neng a e kopa.
I'm just sleeping here.	Ke mpa feela ke robala mona.
I'm glad you're here!	Ke thabetse hore ebe u teng!
He was very nice.	O ne a le monate haholo.
I was there before and I did	Ke ne ke le teng pele mme ka etsa joalo
I thought you were the last	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke uena ea fetileng
I did not handle it well	Ke ne ke sa e tšoara hantle
We had a chance to win it.	Re bile le monyetla oa ho e hlola.
However, he could not reach anything from here.	Leha ho le joalo, o ne a sa khone ho fihlela letho ho tloha mona.
The second is that they were many.	Ea bobeli ke hore li ne li le ngata.
I saw that you were always trying to reach me	Ke bone hore esale o leka ho fihla ho nna
I will start again.	Ke tla qala hape.
Maybe time needed something else.	Mohlomong nako e ne e hloka ntho e 'ngoe hape.
I think he enjoys playing with us	Ke nahana hore o thabela ho bapala le rona
I'm so happy to spend time with you	Ke thabetse ho qeta nako le uena haholo
Then our opportunity will not come.	Joale monyetla oa rona o ke ke oa tla.
He could not believe that he was hearing this.	O ne a sa lumele hore o utloa sena.
Or it would.	Kapa e ne e tla.
We cannot do that.	Re ke ke ra etsa joalo.
I never want to see her again	Ha ke sa batla ho mo bona hape
They just don't know who's coming.	Feela ha ba tsebe hore na ke mang ea tla.
I believe you have something here	Ke lumela hore ho na le ntho eo u nang le eona mona
For a long time, he said nothing.	Ka nako e telele, o ne a sa bue letho.
I knew nothing about it	Ke ne ke sa tsebe letho ka eona
Sometimes I would go home by bicycle	Ka linako tse ling ke ne ke ee ke ee ha hae ka baesekele
No, of course, he said.	Che, ha e le hantle, o ile a re.
I needed to do something.	Ke ne ke hloka ho etsa ho hong.
I think you have it	Ke nahana hore u na le eona
I hope your week has been as fun as mine	Ke tšepa hore beke ea hau e bile monate joaloka ea ka
So you know there's a reason.	Kahoo ua tseba hore ho na le lebaka leo.
I could have told you before, but here it is.	Nka be ke le boleletse pele, empa ke ena e fihla.
Do it quickly.	E etse kapele.
This will make this work unnecessary.	Sena se tla etsa hore mosebetsi ona o se ke oa hlokahala.
I am very tired from work, family and life	Ke khathetse haholo ke mosebetsi, lelapa le bophelo
I asked him to stay with me	Ke ile ka mo kōpa hore a lule le ’na
Sometimes you will see them doing things.	Ka linako tse ling u tla ba bona ba etsa lintho.
He already knew it all.	O ne a se a ntse a e tseba kaofela.
What happens then.	Ho etsahalang ka nako eo .
I've heard it many times	Ke li utloile hangata
I can't wear this.	Ha ke khone ho apara sena.
I know you are very busy	Kea tseba hore u phathahane haholo
No one is coming.	Ha ho na motho ea tlang.
Be present.	E-ba teng.
Here I am, with you now	Ke mona, le uena joale
I had no idea you knew him	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore oa mo tseba
I slept well last night	Ke ile ka robala hantle maobane bosiu
He told me he couldn't tell you about it.	O ile a mpolella hore a ke ke a u bolella ka eona.
I can't believe he didn't come home with us.	Ha ke lumele hore ha aa ka a tla hae le rōna.
Not a bad way to go, he thought.	Ha se tsela e mpe ea ho tsamaea, a nahana.
And I didn't want to tell anyone about it.	Hape ke ne ke sa batle ho bolella mang kapa mang ka eona.
Here and now.	Mona le hona joale.
I tried to talk to him about it.	Ke ile ka leka ho bua le eena ka taba eo.
I have to say that to you	Ke lokela ho bolela seo ho wena
But he did not do any of those things.	Empa ha aa ka a etsa letho la lintho tseo.
He felt some pain.	O ile a utloa bohloko bo itseng.
I had trouble finding him	Ke bile le bothata ba ho mo fumana
Nobody knew where it was.	Ho ne ho se motho ya tsebang moo e leng teng.
If you go out, you do.	Haeba u tsoa, ​​u etsa joalo.
You need to do the same.	Le uena u lokela ho etsa se tšoanang.
I think that would help.	Ke nahana hore seo se ka thusa.
I love her so much	Ke mo rata haholo
I just have to know what it is	Ke tlameha feela ho tseba hore na ke eng
The function of the book can help you to use it	Mosebetsi oa buka o ka u thusa ho sebelisa
I can't, for some reason	Ha ke khone, ka lebaka le itseng
He is having a party.	O etsa mokete.
I will give you information	Ke tla ho fana ka litaba
I have no problem spending all my money	Ha ke na bothata ba ho sebelisa chelete ea ka kaofela
But it was worth it !.	Empa e ne e le ea bohlokoa!.
We have these.	Re na le tsena.
I never thought about that	Ha kea ka ka nahana ka seo
I need to tell you something.	Ke hloka ho o bolella ho hong.
I know he will be out soon	Kea tseba hore o tla tsoa haufinyane
All this.	Tsena tsohle.
I wanted to talk to you last night	Ke ne ke batla ho bua le wena ka maobane bosiu
He does not like anyone.	Ha a rate mang kapa mang.
In a sense, they are the ones who make us human.	Ka tsela e itseng ke tsona tse re etsang batho.
I think that's a good thing	Ke nahana hore ke ntho e ntle
I'll leave you now, till morning.	Ke tla u tlohela joale, ho fihlela hoseng.
But he did not get it.	Empa ha a ka a e fumana.
There was another man who thought about it.	Ho na le monna e mong ea ileng a nahana ka eona.
Not always, but often.	Hase kamehla, empa hangata.
They have no sense.	Ha li na kelello.
I can see right here.	Ke bona hantle mona.
He knows his stuff well.	O tseba lintho tsa hae hantle.
I'll find out tomorrow	Ke tla tseba hosane
They knew what they were talking about.	Ba ne ba tseba hore na ba bua ka eng.
I wonder what else you know.	Kea ipotsa hore na o tseba eng hape.
I will be very grateful if you do not say anything about it.	Ke tla leboha haholo ha o sa bue letho ka hona.
I took care of the man	Ke ile ka hlokomela monna eo
Dad, you didn't hear anything.	Ntate, ha ua utloa letho.
I did not.	Ha kea etsa joalo.
That's where he mentioned some of these things.	Ke hona moo a buileng tse ling tsa lintho tsena.
I have never told anyone, especially your father	Ha ke eso bolelle motho letho, haholo ntate wa hao
I have something to do tonight	Ke na le seo ke lokelang ho se etsa bosiung bona
So if you have just bought one, you have nothing to fear.	Kahoo haeba u sa tsoa reka e le 'ngoe, ha ho letho leo u lokelang ho le tšaba.
I wondered where all this was going	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na sena sohle se ea kae
They do nothing.	Ha ba etse letho.
It is a difficult situation.	Ke boemo bo boima.
Still it was a great place.	Leha ho le joalo e ne e le sebaka se setle.
I said that was true	Ke ile ka bolela hore seo ke 'nete
I was not sure at the time	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hantle ka nako eo
I understand her feelings.	Ke utloisisa maikutlo a hae.
Of course, there was another.	Ha e le hantle, ho ne ho e-na le e 'ngoe.
Some years passed quickly.	Lilemo tse ling li ile tsa tsamaea kapele.
Yes, he would.	E, o ne a tla ba teng.
You did what you could.	U entse seo u neng u ka se khona.
But we could not.	Empa ha rea ​​ka ra khona.
So that was a problem.	Kahoo hoo e ne e le bothata.
It hurts.	Ke bohloko.
I knew it would not be an easy task	Ke ne ke tseba hore e ke ke ea e-ba mosebetsi o bonolo
It really doesn't help to work.	Ha ho hlile ha ho na thuso ho sebetsa.
Everything works for me here.	Ntho e 'ngoe le e' ngoe e sebetsa ho 'na mona.
And, it was fun.	Mme, ho ne ho le monate.
There was a telephone line.	Ho ne ho e-na le mohala oa ntlo.
I was walking.	Ke ne ke tsamaea.
Maybe, too, now, he wants to be a doctor.	Mohlomong, le eena, joale o batla ho ba ngaka.
I knew it must have happened	Ke ne ke tseba hore e tlameha ebe ho bile joalo
I saw the whole thing	Ke ile ka bona ntho eo kaofela
Not very good after that.	Ha e ntle haholo ka mor'a moo.
I will talk to him again	Ke tla bua le eena hape
And if he did, he would feel guilty about it.	’Me haeba a ne a ka etsa joalo, o ne a ikutloa a le molato ka seo.
I wanted it, I needed it	Ke ne ke e batla, ke e hloka
It was similar with her mother.	Ho ne ho bile joalo le ka 'mè oa hae.
That way, help has an easier time finding you.	Ka tsela eo, thuso e na le nako e bonolo ea ho u fumana.
We're out.	Re tsoa .
You must learn to say no.	U lokela ho ithuta ho hana.
I'm better there.	Ke betere moo.
By thinking about them.	Ka ho nahana ka tsona.
I knew that was not the case with any of us	Ke ne ke tseba hore ho ne ho se joalo ka mang kapa mang oa rōna
But it will not do.	Empa ha ho na ho etsa.
I didn't have to see it.	Ke ne ke sa tlameha ho e bona.
That's how good they are.	Ke kamoo ba leng molemo kateng.
It's you.	Ke uena.
I should not have let him go	Ke ne ke sa lokela ho mo tlohela hore a tsamaee
A new way.	Tsela e ncha.
I've seen it just happen	Ke e bone e etsahala feela
I could not understand it.	Ke ne ke sa khone ho e utloisisa.
However, I do not see my shoes	Leha ho le joalo, ha ke bone lieta tsa ka
No one knows everything about me.	Ha ho motho ea tsebang tsohle ka 'na.
I have been without it for about three years	Ke na le lilemo tse ka bang tharo ke se na eona
I don’t think we should help one.	Ha ke nahane hore re lokela ho thusa e le 'ngoe.
I know my way back here	Ke tseba tsela ea ka ea ho khutlela mona
It is better not to go on	Ho molemo hore ke se ke ka tsoela pele
He fell, and.	O ile a oa, 'me.
Some of us joined in as a group.	Ba bang ba rōna ba ne ba kena re le sehlopha.
It could be more.	E ka ba ho feta.
Maybe some knew it.	Mohlomong ba bang ba ne ba e tseba.
I'll just come.	Ke tla feela.
I like to write things like that	Ke rata ho ngola lintho tsa mofuta oo
I will say this.	Ke tla bolela sena.
I wanted it to be someone else	Ke ne ke batla hore e be motho e mong
I want to do everything with you	Ke batla ho etsa tsohle le wena
But they had not met.	Empa ba ne ba eso kopane.
Find out how here !.	Fumana hore na joang mona!.
I was one of these people.	Ke ne ke le e mong oa batho bana.
I know exactly where he is.	Ke tseba hantle moo a leng teng.
That my wife stayed with me.	Hore mosali oa ka o ile a lula le 'na.
Look how beautiful you are.	Sheba kamoo o leng motle kateng.
I did not know what it meant	Ke ne ke sa tsebe hore na ho bolela eng
I had no idea what was going on at the time	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore na ho etsahalang ka nako eo
You are a group.	U sehlopha.
I wondered why that was so	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na ke hobane’ng ha ho le joalo
As it would work.	Joalo ka ha ho ne ho tla sebetsa.
I was not.	Ke ne ke se joalo.
What would such a child look like?	Ngoana ea joalo o ne a tla ba joang.
A few things, of course	Lintho tse 'maloa, ha e le hantle
It was just a day of the week.	E ne e le letsatsi feela la beke.
Really nice.	Ka sebele e ntle haholo.
I only ask this of you	Ke kopa sena feela ho lona
I like to read and write	Ke rata ho bala le ho ngola
She looked like she could cry at any moment.	O ne a shebahala eka a ka lla neng kapa neng.
All those old things.	Lintho tseo tsohle tsa khale.
I know he did not.	Kea tseba ha a ka a etsa joalo.
This is not a matter for the police.	Sena ha se taba ea mapolesa.
I really don’t care.	Ka sebele ha ke tsotelle.
I still have many things to tell you	Ke sa na le lintho tse ngata tseo ke lokelang ho le bolella tsona
When the time comes, he will leave.	Ha nako e fihla, o tla tloha.
I told her that you already have a boyfriend.	Ke ile ka mo bolella hore u se u ntse u e-na le mohlankana.
I asked her if she was upset	Ke ile ka mo botsa hore na o ne a utloile bohloko
You don't really care.	Ha o hlile ha o tsotelle.
I start to wish it could really exist.	Ke qala ho lakatsa eka e ka be e hlile e le teng.
I had felt the pain I was experiencing	Ke ne ke utloile bohloko boo ke neng ke e-na le bona
And that's what we did.	Mme ke seo re se entseng.
I tried to catch him	Ke ile ka leka ho mo tšoara
And for people who do that.	Le ho batho ba etsang joalo.
And you can do it for hours.	'Me u ka e etsa lihora tse ngata.
As never before.	Joalo ka mohla o kileng oa ba teng.
I was looking at my shoes	Ke ne ke ntse ke sheba lieta tsa ka
Do a good job.	Etsa mosebetsi o motle.
I know it won't help	Kea tseba hore ho ke ke ha thusa
That's when we started having problems.	Ke moo re ileng ra qala ho ba le mathata.
I will never make that mistake again	Ha ke sa tla etsa phoso eo hape
She tries on the back door.	O leka lemati le ka morao.
Of course, you will want to stay here.	Ehlile, u tla batla ho lula mona.
Of course, we had our moments.	Ehlile, re bile le linako tsa rona.
Maybe we see that now.	Mohlomong re bona seo hona joale.
I know how to get there quickly	Ke tseba mokhoa oa ho fihla moo kapele
I just visited	Ke sa tsoa etela
Like being a child again.	Joalo ka ho ba ngoana hape.
I wanted one thing	Ke ne ke batla ntho e le 'ngoe
I'm sure you did	Ke na le bonnete ba hore o e entse
I know for many, that is not the case	Kea tseba hore ho ba bangata, ha ho joalo
Eventually this will pass.	Qetellong sena se tla feta.
I really enjoyed the work they did	Ke thabetse mosebetsi oo ba o entseng haholo
But he knew nothing.	Empa o ne a sa tsebe letho.
She is crying for her mother.	A ntse a lla ka 'm'e.
I'm afraid to talk to my pain doctor.	Ke tšaba ho bua le ngaka ea ka ea bohloko.
I couldn't take that	Ke ne ke sa khone ho nka seo
And so it was now.	Mme ho ne ho le jwalo jwale.
I don't know what it is	Ha ke tsebe hore na ke eng
I didn't want to do those things.	Ke ne ke sa batle ho etsa lintho tseo.
I was really hurt	Ka sebele ke ile ka utloa bohloko
He had decided on her.	O ne a entse qeto ka eena.
I need to work on this	Ke hloka ho sebetsa ho sena
Everything else.	Lintho tse ling kaofela.
It just has to work.	E tlameha ho sebetsa feela.
I was happy to be back	Ke ne ke thabetse ho khutla
No, this was not to be.	Che, sena se ne se sa lokela ho ba joalo.
He needed a place.	O ne a hloka sebaka.
I asked to be arrested.	Ke ile ka kopa ho mo tšoara.
He was sorry we didn't have to.	O ile a utloa bohloko hore re se ke ra tlameha.
I wonder what it will be like for other people	Kea ipotsa hore na ho tla ba joang ho batho ba bang
This is dangerous.	Sena se kotsi.
You certainly would not expect that to happen.	Ka sebele u ke ke ua lebella se ka etsahalang.
This is a long time and we must find it again.	Ena ke nako e telele 'me re tlameha ho e fumana hape.
We take care of everything.	Re hlokomela ntho e 'ngoe le e 'ngoe.
If anything, we need more.	Haeba ho na le letho, re hloka ho feta.
Then he can know what it is.	Joale a ka tseba hore na ke eng.
I had to convince her a lot	Ke ile ka tlameha ho mo kholisa haholo
I hope it never will be the same	Ke tšepa hore ha ho sa tla ba joalo
Copy.	Kopa.
Of course, always.	Ha e le hantle, ka linako tsohle.
We feel strong.	Re utloa matla.
I saw another man in their group	Ke ile ka bona monna e mong sehlopheng sa bona
I want you to get it	Ke batla hore o e fumane
We enjoyed going out.	Re ile ra thabela ho tsoa.
I became a father to them	Ke ile ka ba motho oa ntate ho eena oa bona
Most people like to buy and own things	Batho ba bangata ba rata ho reka le ho ba le lintho
However, I know what many people are saying about him	Leha ho le joalo, ke tseba seo batho ba bangata ba se buang ka eena
If we can work together, think of what will happen in the future.	Haeba re khona ho sebetsa hammoho, nahana ka se tla etsahala nakong e tlang.
They are still friends.	E ntse e le metsoalle.
He was glad to be able to say it.	O ne a thabetse ho khona ho e bua.
Start writing things down.	Qala ho ngola lintho fatše.
I did not want to hear her cry like that	Ke ne ke sa rate ho mo utloa a lla joalo
They came in almost friends.	Ba ile ba kena hoo e ka bang metsoalle.
Again, we can do this.	Hape, re ka etsa sena.
I feel good about myself.	Ke ikutloa ke le monate ho 'na.
He was very sad.	O ne a utloile bohloko haholo.
He returned a week later.	O ile a khutla ka mor'a beke.
I heard about what happened today	Ke utloile ka se etsahetseng kajeno
This is very easy for the police.	Sena se bonolo haholo ho mapolesa.
Yes, they did.	E, ba ile ba etsa joalo.
This is just my opinion.	Ena ke maikutlo a ka feela.
I don't see anything of value here	Ha ke bone letho le leng la bohlokoa ba letho mona
I did not want to go back	Ke ne ke sa batle ho khutlela morao
But she wanted, somehow, to cry.	Empa o ne a batla, ka tsela e itseng, ho lla.
They may be with you because they are afraid of being alone.	Ba ka ba le uena hobane ba tšaba ho ba mong.
And he seems to be doing a good job.	Mme ho bonahala eka o etsa mosebetsi o motle.
It only takes one chance to win !.	Ho nka monyetla o le mong feela ho hlola!.
I needed to talk to you	Ke ne ke hloka ho bua le uena
All you have to do is talk.	Seo u lokelang ho se etsa ke ho bua feela.
I wondered how much they slept	Ke ile ka ipotsa hore na ba robala hakae
I thanked her very much for doing this	Ke ile ka mo leboha haholo ka ho etsa sena
I'll be in the back.	Ke tla ba ka morao.
You will love it here.	U tla e rata mona.
It starts small.	E qala hanyane.
I talked a lot about it with my parents.	Ke ile ka bua haholo ka eona le batsoali ba ka.
I wanted to start living again	Ke ne ke batla ho qala ho phela hape
I continued.	Ke ile ka tsoela pele.
I can't say more than that	Ha ke khone ho bua ho feta moo
I would have asked.	Nka be ke ile ka botsa.
It works well for me.	E sebetsa hantle ho nna.
I will seek them out	ke tla ba batla
I wore it only a few times.	Ke ne ke e apara ka makhetlo a 'maloa feela.
If you do the work, you will get what you want.	Haeba u etsa mosebetsi, u tla fumana seo u se batlang.
I have told you why this is so important to me	Ke u boleletse hore na ke hobane'ng ha sena se le bohlokoa hakana ho 'na
If he had asked, he would have refused again.	Ha a ne a ka botsa, o ne a tla hana hape.
I will not take much of your time	Nke ke ka nka nako ea hau e ngata
I think about what you want to hear	Ke nahana ka seo u batlang ho se utloa
None of this is important.	Ha ho letho la sena la bohlokoa.
I felt lonely and worthless	Ke ne ke ikutloa ke le mong ke bile ke se na thuso
You also know that it can take time.	Hape ua tseba hore ho ka nka nako.
He wondered if this would be a problem.	O ne a ipotsa hore na ebe hona e tla ba bothata.
Probably more than we should.	Mohlomong ho feta kamoo re lokelang.
I didn't even have to ask.	Ke ne ke sa tlameha le ho botsa.
I was waiting for something to happen	Ke ne ke emetse ho hong ho etsahala
Do not try to finish the book just because you feel compelled.	U se ke ua leka ho qeta buka hobane feela u ikutloa u tlameha.
I had nothing to say	Ke ne ke sena letho leo nka le buang
I took them.	Ke ile ka li nka.
But it doesn't seem to be working.	Empa ho bonahala eka ha ea sebetsa.
I did not want to live again	Ke ne ke se ke sa batle ho phela hape
I want to do something about it.	Ke batla ho etsa ho hong ka hona.
And just think of this.	Mme nahana feela ka sena.
He was not here.	O ne a le sieo mona.
I want to know how all this happens.	Ke batla ho tseba hore na sena sohle se etsahala joang.
We too find many of them.	Le rona re fumana tse ngata tsa tsona.
I wanted to know how it felt	Ke ne ke batla ho tseba hore na e ikutloa joang
I could not let go of him.	Ke ne ke sitoa ho mo tlohela.
Yes, she loves working with her husband.	Ee, o rata ho sebetsa le monna oa hae.
I have to write about something	Ke tlameha ho ngola ka ho hong
I do not see.	Ha ke bone.
I don't know where he got them	Ha ke tsebe hore na o li nkile kae
I know how hard it is for you	Kea tseba hore na ho thata hakae ho uena
I will never take it again	Ha ke sa tla hlola ke e nka
But what would he do if one of them was.	Empa o ne a ka etsa eng haeba e mong oa bona.
Of course they are.	Ehlile ba joalo.
Or your time, today.	Kapa nako ea hau, kajeno.
I thought it was all my fault	Ke ne ke nahana hore ke molato oa ka kaofela
This was a pain that would last a long time.	Ena e ne e le bohloko bo neng bo tla nka nako e telele.
They can't do it any other way.	Ba ke ke ba etsa ka tsela e ’ngoe.
The same thing about being a woman.	Ntho e joalo ka ho ba mosali.
Only me and the children.	Nna le bana feela.
You may not have time.	E ka 'na eaba ha u na nako.
They could have made you human again.	Ba ka be ba u entse motho hape.
I did not like the book.	Ke ne ke sa rate buka eo.
She seemed to be a good mother.	O ne a bonahala eka ke 'mè ea molemo.
Think before you speak.	Nahana pele u bua.
Because this is their last chance.	Hobane ona ke monyetla oa bona oa ho qetela.
I was not thinking of anyone	Ke ne ke sa nahane ka mang kapa mang
It is not new to this.	Ha e ncha ho sena.
And here's the problem.	'Me mona ho na le bothata.
They meet other children just like them.	Ba kopana le bana ba bang joalo ka bona.
Well, that day is today.	Be, letsatsi leo ke kajeno.
Here are three of our favorite ones soon.	Mona ke tse tharo tsa tseo re li ratang haufinyane.
As he passed, he thought.	Ha a feta feela, a nahana.
Sometimes, you just sit down and think about it.	Ka linako tse ling, u lula fatše 'me u nahane ka eona.
Must know in the end.	E tlameha ho tseba qetellong.
Another car will be there.	Koloi e 'ngoe hape o tla be a le teng.
I feel better about it now.	Ke ikutloa ke le betere ka eona hona joale.
My parents have never had one.	Batsoali ba ka ha ba e-s'o ka ba e-ba le eona.
I was happy to be in their team	Ke ne ke thabile ha ke le sehlopheng sa bona
Talk to as many people as you can.	Bua le batho ba bangata kamoo u ka khonang.
I knew it was true as he did	Ke ne ke tseba hore ke 'nete joalo ka ha a entse
This is not easy.	Sena ha se bonolo.
I don't know what to do, really.	Ha ke tsebe seo nka se etsang, ruri.
Not so.	Haho joalo.
He did not wonder why so many others were not doing so.	Ha aa ka a ipotsa hore na ke hobane'ng ha ba bang ba bangata ba sa etse joalo.
I fell in love with him a lot	Ke ne ke qala ho mo rata haholo
They must have food.	Ba tlameha ho ba le lijo.
There is something for everyone.	Ho na le ho hong bakeng sa motho e mong le e mong.
You did not see many of them.	Ha ua ka ua bona tse ngata tsa tsona.
He just loves it so much here.	O mpa a e rata haholo mona.
I did not spend time well	Ha kea ka ka qeta nako hantle
How it is coming.	E ntse e tla joang.
I have always been, and always will be	Haesale ke le teng, mme ke tla dula ke le teng
I was really not a breakfast person	Ke ne ke hlile ke se motho oa lijo tsa hoseng
I decide to tell her the truth	Ke etsa qeto ea ho mo bolella ’nete
He had a wonderful life.	O ne a na le bophelo bo monate.
What I did.	Seo ke se entseng.
Some are more equal than others, as we know.	Ba bang ba lekana ho feta ba bang, joalo ka ha re tseba.
I think they will win	Ke nahana hore ba tla hlola
I did not have time to tell you	Ke ne ke se na nako ea ho u bolella
I have never had the opportunity to meet him before	Ha ke so fumane monyetla oa ho kopana le eena pele
I didn't save anything.	Ha kea ka ka boloka letho le leng.
I will never make that mistake again	Ha ke sa tla etsa phoso e jwalo hape
The first question.	Potso ea pele.
However, this was not always the case	Leha ho le joalo, hase kamehla ke neng ke le joalo
I feel closer to him than ever before	Ke ikutloa eka o haufi le 'na ho feta leha e le neng pele
My husband was the one who started this with her.	Monna oa ka ke eena ea ileng a qala sena le eena.
It's very easy, but he refused.	Ho bonolo haholo, empa o ile a hana.
I did not want to leave him	Ke ne ke sa batle ho mo tlohela
He cares about us.	O na le taba ka rona.
I almost know him, but really	Ke batla ke mo tseba, empa ha e le hantle
Because he is beautiful.	Hobane o motle.
I can write a book	Nka ngola buka
Maybe someone else would get to know him.	Mohlomong motho e mong o ne a tla mo tseba.
She's not pretty, but this is the way she should be.	Ha a motle, empa ena ke tsela eo a lokelang ho ba ka eona.
However, I did not arrive today	Leha ho le joalo, ha kea ka ka fihla kajeno
I just wanted you to know that this is happening	Ke ne ke batla feela hore le tsebe hore sena sea etsahala
They are his many.	Ke bona ba bangata ba hae.
I can do much better.	Nka etsa betere haholo.
There is no way they can.	Haho kamoo ba ka khonang.
What will happen ?.	Ho tla etsahalang?.
In fact, it could have been worse.	Ha e le hantle e ka be e bile mpe le ho feta.
This process will only continue.	Mokhoa ona o tla tsoela pele feela.
But no one really knows.	Empa ha ho motho ea tsebang hantle.
Also, you eat both.	Hape, le ja ka bobeli.
I had a lot of fun for the first time.	Ke ile ka ba le monate o moholo lekhetlo la pele.
I needed to say more	Ke ne ke hloka ho bua tse ling
Usually, it works.	Hangata, ea sebetsa.
But it did not matter, he thought.	Empa ho ne ho se na taba, o ne a nahana joalo.
I will do it.	Ke tla e etsa.
Our friends.	Metsoalle ea rona.
He had taken the weapon.	O ne a nkile sebetsa.
He picked up the phone.	A nka mohala.
I did not do it today.	Ha kea e etsa kajeno.
It was not yours.	E ne e se ea hao.
Please, do not do that.	Ke kopa o seke oa etsa joalo.
I understand that you did not finish high school	Kea utloisisa hore ha ua qeta sekolong se phahameng
I didn't want to be alone with him	Ke ne ke sa batle ho ba mong le eena
I have those moments too	Le 'na ke na le linako tseo
Not to think.	Ha se ho nahana.
I needed some time for myself	Ke ne ke hloka nako e itseng bakeng sa ka
The issue was clear enough.	Taba ena e ne e hlakile ho lekana.
I feel like I want to have this now.	Ke ikutloa ke batla ho ba le sena hona joale.
I didn't think anyone would notice	Ke ne ke sa nahane hore ho na le motho ea tla e hlokomela
But there was a mistake.	Empa ho ne ho e-na le phoso.
He has been in the area ever since.	Ho tloha ka nako eo o ne a le sebakeng sena.
I wanted him to do it.	Ke ne ke batla hore a e etse.
I have to do the same for him	Ke tlameha ho mo etsetsa se tšoanang
They will never leave it again.	Ha ba sa tla hlola ba e tlohela.
I like this picture	Ke thabetse setšoantšo sena
Tomorrow is another day and another opportunity to try again.	Hosane ke letsatsi le leng le monyetla o mong oa ho leka hape.
Maybe that's a question.	Mohlomong ke potso.
Somehow it did.	Ka tsela e itseng e ile ea etsa joalo.
They love it there.	Ba e rata moo.
Once you have a problem you feel much better.	Hang ha u fumana bothata u ikutloa u le betere haholo.
I have heard everything	Ke utloile tsohle tse teng
