And also good.	A tiež dobrý.

He'll want to be there.	Bude tam chcieť byť.
It's gone.	To je preč.

He should know.	Mal by to vedieť.
Did you have it?	Mali ste to?

I've never seen him before.	Nikdy predtým som ho nevidel.
I have to get it, she said.	Musím to dostať, povedala si.
Neither wanted to.	Ani jeden to nechcel.
i just think	len myslím.
This is a new day.	Toto je nový deň.
If you want.	Ak chceš.
Not mine.	Moja nie.
Maybe it was something completely different.	Možno to bolo niečo úplne iné.
She told him everything.	Povedala mu všetko.
I'm really not sure.	Naozaj si nie som istý.
I'm sure he has.	Som si istý, že to má.
He arrived at the meeting very late.	Na stretnutie prišiel veľmi neskoro.
I'm going to help you.	Idem ti pomôcť.
I could be there for years.	Mohol by som tam byť roky.
There are none now.	Teraz už žiadne nie sú.
You just can't.	Jednoducho nemôžeš.
He talked to him.	Hovoril s ním.
Too happy for a while.	Na chvíľu príliš šťastný.
He still had work to do.	Stále mal čo robiť.
Only for many years.	Len o veľa rokov.
But this is usually not the case.	Ale zvyčajne to tak nie je.
I knew how hard he tried.	Vedel som, ako veľmi sa snažil.
I know you're right.	Viem, že máš pravdu.
He couldn't talk to me.	Nemohol so mnou hovoriť.
She didn't even like it.	Nebola ani rada.
He decided to stay.	Rozhodol sa zostať.
It can also be something completely different.	Môže to byť aj niečo úplne iné.
It will be fine!.	Bude sa dobre!.
This is where you want to be.	To je miesto, kde chcete byť.
She wasn't feeling well.	Nebolo jej dobre.
I think a lot of people can.	Myslím, že veľa ľudí môže.
I had to go for it.	Musel som do toho ísť.
Not for the first time.	Nie prvýkrát.
This is him.	Toto je ten.
It seemed fine to me.	Zdalo sa mi to v poriadku.
In fact, it is not.	V skutočnosti to tak nie je.
As it should be.	Tak ako by mala byť.
For a while.	Na chvíľu.
They both knew it.	Obaja to vedeli.
I didn't know what it was.	Nevedel som, čo to je.
She told me and she was always right.	Povedala mi to a vždy mala pravdu.
They had no children.	Nemali deti.
He doesn't want him to look that way.	Nechce, aby tak vyzeral.
He can't get out of it.	Nemôže sa z toho dostať.
I want to go out.	Chcem ísť von.
It just wasn't mine.	Len to nebolo moje.
You can do it and you will do it.	Môžete to urobiť a budete to robiť.
She should be fine.	Mala by byť v poriadku.
I hope you are happy.	Dúfam, že si šťastný.
He wasn't sure how it happened.	Nebol si istý, ako sa to stalo.
Someone was there.	Niekto tam bol.
Not her.	Nie jej.
I can't even eat.	Nemôžem ani jesť.
Little three children.	Mali tri deti.
I know mine.	Viem, že ten môj áno.
But he can't.	Ale nemôže.
That's what this is all about.	O to tu skutočne ide.
Everything was so different from there.	Všetko bolo také iné ako tam.
None of us did.	Nikto z nás to neurobil.
I know this very well.	Viem to úplne dobre.
He didn't want to leave.	Nechcel odísť.
But it would be good for me to go.	Ale bolo by pre mňa dobré ísť.
But there was one problem.	Bol tu však jeden problém.
That's exactly what he wanted.	Presne toto chcel.
Nothing has ever been good enough.	Nikdy nebolo nič dosť dobré.
I said it.	Povedal som to.
I have some money.	Mám nejaké peniaze.
I never wanted kids.	Nikdy som nechcel deti.
Like yesterday.	Ako včera.
And maybe it's happening even now.	A možno sa to deje aj teraz.
Does it really look like that?	Naozaj tak vyzerá?
I don't want his money.	Nechcem jeho peniaze.
I'm here for the baby.	Som tu pre dieťa.
He has to have it to get here.	Aby sa sem dostal, musí ho mať.
You can help me more.	Môžete mi pomôcť viac.
I'm sick of you.	Je mi z teba zle.
It's something to see.	Je to niečo vidieť.
I know who it is.	Viem, kto to je.
He will go there again this year.	Tento rok tam pôjde znova.
He saw nothing.	Nevidel nič.
He said anyway.	Tak aj tak povedal.
Nobody knew anything.	Nikto nič nevedel.
Maybe today.	Možno aj dnes.
You probably are.	Pravdepodobne ste.
That was really hard for me.	To bolo pre mňa naozaj ťažké.
I really, really hope so.	Naozaj, naozaj dúfam, že áno.
You will have some tomorrow.	Zajtra budeš mať nejaké.
Maybe they hadn't.	Možno nemali.
This was not the case before.	Predtým to tak nebolo.
But never him.	Nikdy však jej.
But it can't be.	Ale to nemôže byť.
But that's not good enough.	Ale to nie je dosť dobré.
I never wanted anyone more.	Nikdy som nechcel nikoho viac.
I wanted to talk to you.	Chcel som s tebou hovoriť.
He didn't say that.	Nepovedal to.
I can go alone.	Môžem ísť sám.
It used to be.	To niekedy bolo.
He talked about it.	Hovoril o tom.
This is truth.	Toto je pravda.
I was too busy.	Bol som príliš zaneprázdnený.
Please help.	Prosím o pomoc.
I haven't worn it yet.	Ešte som to nemal na sebe.
It won't be a problem for me.	Pre mňa to nebude problém.
I have not seen.	Nevidel som.
What did you do?	Čo si to urobil.
You gave me life.	Dal si mi život.
You can help us here.	Tu nám môžete pomôcť.
We have all day.	Máme celý deň.
He never knew exactly why.	Nikdy presne nevedel prečo.
She's here with us.	Je tu s nami.
We would like to have some of that.	Chceli by sme niečo z toho mať.
He said he wanted me to throw him a party.	Povedal, že chce, aby som mu urobil párty.
When he saw you there.	Keď ťa tam videl.
I didn't think it would really work.	Nemyslel som si, že skutočne pôjde.
I'm sure there's nothing there.	Som si istý, že tam nič nie je.
It looks pretty good.	Vyzerá to celkom dobre.
Say you will.	Povedz, že budeš.
His father told him.	Povedal mu otec.
He was much more.	Bol oveľa viac.
New movie.	Nový film.
Seriously.	Tu vážne.
I wanted me to do it.	Chcel som, aby som to urobil.
Here's mine.	Tu je môj.
And that is something that cannot be.	A to je niečo, čo nemôže byť.
He would definitely wait.	Určite by čakal.
I wish you would let me go now.	Prial by som si, aby si ma teraz nechal ísť.
There is nothing he can do.	Nemôže robiť nič.
That's what he thinks.	To si myslí.
Really really really.	Skutočne skutočne skutočne.
It was too hard to say.	Bolo to príliš ťažké povedať.
It looks quite simple.	Vyzerá celkom jednoducho.
But in fact it happened.	Ale v skutočnosti sa to stalo.
His life will never be the same again.	Jeho život už nikdy nebude ako predtým.
And about that.	A o tom.
But there is a problem.	Je tu však problém.
I really need to talk to him.	Naozaj sa s ním potrebujem porozprávať.
But we have enough time together.	Ale máme spolu dosť času.
In fact, it is.	V skutočnosti je.
He was there for a long time.	Bol tam dlho.
I mean it very seriously.	Myslím to veľmi vážne.
That way you could.	Tak by si mohol.
This is definitely true.	Toto je určite pravda.
I want to help you.	Chcem ti pomôcť.
There are many.	Je ich veľa.
Very, very bad.	Veľmi, veľmi zle.
No, we're on our own.	Nie, sme na to sami.
Some of it is mine.	Niečo z toho je moje.
Someone will definitely get to that.	Niekto sa k tomu určite dostane.
If not today, tomorrow, soon.	Ak nie dnes, zajtra, čoskoro.
It's really hard to find.	Je naozaj ťažké nájsť.
I was almost not there.	Takmer som tam nebol.
And no one did anything about it.	A nikto s tým nič neurobil.
That actually happened.	To sa v skutočnosti stalo.
Things are no longer the case.	Veci už nie sú také.
We can't have him without you.	Bez teba ho nemôžeme mať.
And that's really saying something.	A to už naozaj niečo hovorí.
It's definitely there.	Určite tam je.
But neither is life.	Ale ani život.
You can stay.	Môžete zostať.
He does it every day.	Robí to každý deň.
You just knew that.	Len si to vedel.
I'm still the same guy.	Som stále ten istý chlap.
It wasn't just today.	Nebolo to len dnes.
There's a house	Je tu dom
Maybe a year.	Možno aj rok.
Maybe he'll come tomorrow.	Možno zajtra príde.
I simply won't.	Jednoducho nebudem.
I returned it.	Vrátil som to.
Yes, if only.	Áno, keby len.
She should know better.	Mala by to vedieť lepšie.
There weren't enough people.	Nebolo dosť ľudí.
That was a very good idea.	To bol veľmi dobrý nápad.
It was so good to be home, he told us.	Bolo také dobré byť doma, povedal nám.
They were so lucky.	Mali také šťastie.
I was like.	Bol som ako.
This is really difficult.	Toto je naozaj ťažké.
And you will too.	A ty budeš tiež.
We have to find them.	Musíme ich nájsť.
But we can't have it.	Ale to nemôžeme mať.
My father knew that.	Otec to vedel.
Not a little bit.	Ani trochu.
There doesn't have to be luck in that.	Šťastie v tom nemusí byť.
Everyone was trying to get there.	Každý sa tam snažil dostať.
They did it for me.	Urobili to pre mňa.
Or rather they are.	Alebo skôr sú.
He was unable to say anything else.	Nebol schopný povedať nič iné.
I'll do exactly that.	Urobím presne to.
Maybe yes.	Možno áno.
I'm very happy.	Som veľmi rád.
This must happen.	Toto sa musí stať.
Or should have done.	Alebo mal robiť.
She should have gotten back.	Mala sa dostať späť.
You should do it early in the morning.	Mali by ste to urobiť skoro ráno.
She's had enough.	Už toho mala dosť.
He arrived late today.	Dnes prišiel neskoro.
It's been there before.	Bolo to tam predtým.
In fact, yes.	V skutočnosti áno.
But even this has problems.	Ale aj toto má problémy.
He must have known for a long time.	Musel to vedieť už dosť dlho.
It's been a long time, he felt.	Bolo to dlho, cítil.
But he still looked like a child.	Ale stále vyzeral ako dieťa.
I'm not sure any of this is true.	Nie som si istý, či je niečo z toho pravda.
I went to school.	Išiel som do školy.
Things were different here.	Tu boli veci iné.
And it happened.	A stalo sa.
I told him there would be no more.	Povedal som mu, že viac už nebude.
It's not that he actually gave something.	Nie je to tak, že v skutočnosti niečo dal.
She had to do it.	Mala na to, aby to urobila.
I'm fine, really.	Som v poriadku, naozaj.
I had to go there.	Musel som tam ísť.
But it was really good for me.	Ale to bolo pre mňa naozaj dobré.
I was there for a while.	Bol som tam istý čas.
But not until later.	Ale až neskôr.
He didn't know what to tell her.	Nevedel, čo jej má povedať.
I think he will play again.	Myslím, že bude hrať znova.
It's morning.	To je ráno.
She told him she had to tell him something.	Povedala mu, že mu musí niečo povedať.
And not enough.	A nie dosť.
I was an old guy.	Bol som starý chlap.
Okay, we did it.	Dobre, urobili sme to.
And it was here, it happened again.	A bolo to tu, stalo sa to znova.
But tell him to do something more.	Ale povedz mu, aby urobil niečo viac.
He didn't know why you did it.	Nevedel, prečo si to urobil.
I'm not sure about that either.	Ani tým si nie som istý.
That's what I wanted.	Tak som chcel.
I really don't know anything about that.	Naozaj o tom nič neviem.
But it was true.	Bola to však pravda.
Or so it looks.	Alebo to tak vyzerá.
But there is much more to it.	Ale je toho oveľa viac.
Everyone gets their place.	Každý dostane svoje miesto.
But this takes time.	Ale toto chce čas.
He does this.	Toto robí.
I can find it again.	Môžem to znova nájsť.
I heard about it.	Počul som o tom.
He just thought he was.	Len si myslel, že je.
I wanted to tell you something.	Chcel som ti niečo povedať.
I would have to say no.	Musel by som povedať nie.
It will be hard.	Bude to ťažké.
It is too early.	Je príliš skoro.
She's doing very well.	Ide jej to veľmi dobre.
I know not.	Viem, že nie.
I want you to be happy and look happy here.	Chcem, aby si bol šťastný a vyzeral si tu šťastný.
But they couldn't help themselves.	Ale nevedeli si pomôcť.
When was the last time you saw me?	Kedy si ma videl naposledy?
It will be good for you.	Bude to pre vás dobré.
Tell me.	Povedz mi.
But you wouldn't know.	Ale ty by si to nevedel.
Tell yourself that everything will be fine.	Povedz si, že všetko bude v poriadku.
Nothing but this.	Nič iné ako toto.
They wanted to play.	Chceli sa hrať.
Maybe yes.	Možno áno.
That's advice, if you will.	To je rada, ak chcete.
That's what it needs more.	To je to, čo potrebuje viac.
There is enough time.	Času je dosť.
I didn't care.	Bolo mi to jedno.
Can you help me with that?	Môžete mi s tým pomôcť?
I am very glad that you are here.	Som veľmi rád, že si tu.
Have you ever had this idea?	Mali ste niekedy tento nápad?
About the same as at home.	Asi rovnako ako doma.
There was a man.	Tu bol muž.
And it's not.	A nie je.
That's why we are.	To je dôvod, prečo sme.
Do you think we have to go there?	Myslíš, že tam musíme ísť?
I'm glad you're here.	Som rád, že ste tu.
I'm not even supposed to be here.	Vôbec tu nemám byť.
I just had it there.	Práve som to tam mal.
I went back to work alone.	Vrátil som sa do práce sám.
They would be at home.	Boli by doma.
And he learned to do it when he was a child.	A naučil sa to robiť, keď bol ešte dieťa.
It's not your problem.	To nie je tvoj problém.
He really didn't want to talk about it.	Naozaj o tom nechcel hovoriť.
And so it goes.	A tak to ide.
About what we have and how lucky we are to have it.	O tom, čo máme a aké máme šťastie, že to máme.
I don't think anyone did.	Myslím, že to nikto neurobil.
Someone would leave.	Niekto by odišiel.
I'm not the only one.	Nie som jediný.
It really was nothing serious.	Naozaj to nebolo nič vážne.
He is not really a child.	V skutočnosti nie je dieťa.
I had to buy one for myself.	Musel som si jeden kúpiť aj pre seba.
That was probably the case.	Pravdepodobne to tak bolo.
You just have to do it.	Len to musíte urobiť.
He has none.	Nemá žiadne.
She would be there.	Bola by tam.
But it will.	Ale bude.
Do you want to sleep.	Chceš spať.
There was a lot of it.	Bolo toho veľa.
I don't want it to be me.	Nechcem, aby som to bol ja.
Even more than last year.	Ešte viac ako minulý rok.
They knew it.	Vedeli to.
I do not want that.	to nechcem.
Not yet, it will be a week.	Ešte nie, bude to týždeň.
And now we were here.	A teraz sme tu boli.
He was ready for me.	Bol na mňa pripravený.
I had to leave.	Musel som odísť.
Or do you think so.	Alebo si myslíte, že áno.
It's useless to us.	Nie je nám na nič.
The food is here.	Jedlo je tu.
To the point.	K veci.
It wasn't quite.	Nebolo to úplne.
I want to do mine.	Chcem robiť svoje.
It happened again.	Stalo sa to znova.
There is so much more going on.	Deje sa toho oveľa viac.
It's much better.	Je to oveľa lepšie.
Is that really all you want to say?	Je to naozaj všetko, čo chceš povedať?
I was waiting for it to come.	Čakal som, kedy to príde.
I heard about it.	Počul som o tom.
The children were so that no one could see them.	Deti boli tak, aby ich nikto nevidel.
I want it for you.	Chcem to pre teba.
You can go if you want.	Môžete ísť, ak chcete.
I know what it looks like, though.	Viem, ako to vyzerá, ale.
Not like that.	Nie taký.
And everyone knew it.	A každý to vedel.

He was very busy.	Bol veľmi zaneprázdnený.
I know how to do it.	Viem ako na to.
They were fine.	Boli v poriadku.
But probably not.	Ale asi nie.

I know it was you.	Viem, že si to bol ty.
I think he's gone.	Myslím, že je preč.
It's been here a long time.	Je tu dosť dlho.

Now to why you are here.	Teraz k tomu, prečo ste tu.
That can't happen.	Tak to sa nemôže stať.

I did all that.	To všetko som dokázal.
Maybe he will see you.	Možno vás bude vidieť.
I will work on it.	Budem na tom pracovať.
I don't know how to do it.	neviem ako na to.
I don't want this.	toto nechcem.

He was happy.	Bol šťastný.
He was human.	Bol to človek.
And so it was.	A tak to aj bolo.

He saw things.	Videl veci.
There wasn't much to say.	Nebolo toho veľa čo povedať.

I came back.	Vrátil som sa.
There was something wrong.	Niečo tam nebolo v poriadku.
The first time.	Prvýkrát.
I wasn't supposed to come to work today.	Dnes som nemal prísť do práce.
That is the only life there is ever.	To je jediný život, ktorý tam kedy je.
Not yet.	Ešte nie.
He couldn't do it.	Nebol toho schopný.
However, he soon realized what was happening.	Čoskoro si však uvedomil, čo sa deje.
And he tells us why it was so hard to find them.	A hovorí nám, prečo bolo také ťažké ich nájsť.
I would like to buy a house.	Chcel by som si kúpiť dom.
No such luck.	Žiadne také šťastie.
It was definitely his.	Určite to bolo jeho.
I've never seen it before.	Nikdy predtým som to nevidel.
We were only a few years old.	Mali sme len pár rokov.
You could give it to me.	Mohol by si mi dať.
Little three children.	Mali tri deti.
Did you hear that?	Počul si to?
You want that.	To chceš.
It won't matter.	To bude jedno.
A little better now.	Teraz trochu lepšie.
It was hard, it was hard.	Bolo to ťažké, bolo to ťažké.
But it wasn't just that.	Ale nebolo to len tak.
Is there anybody?	Je tam niekto?
That's not what I want.	To nie je to, čo chcem.
Not even who put it there, or who knew it was there.	Ani to, kto to tam dal, alebo kto vedel, že to tam je.
Maybe it's not as bad as it looks.	Možno nie je taký zlý, ako to vyzerá.
It was nothing.	To nič nebolo.
I was good for his money and for more.	Bol som dobrý pre jeho peniaze a pre viac.
You really shouldn't do that.	To by si naozaj nemal robiť.
I can't leave.	Nemôžem odísť.
I told him the truth.	Povedal som mu pravdu.
That's not good for anyone.	To nie je dobré pre nikoho.
I really think he meant what he said.	Naozaj si myslím, že to, čo povedal, myslel vážne.
I've been waiting so long.	Tak dlho som na to čakal.
You have to go.	Musíte ísť.
But maybe it was a good thing.	Ale možno to bolo dobré.
I have no problem with him.	Nemám s ním problém.
It's like being home.	Je to ako byť doma.
When he returned, he was not well.	Keď sa vrátil, nebolo mu dobre.
What is it about.	O čom to je.
I wouldn't want to.	nechcel by som.
This is how it's done.	Takto sa to robí.
You have plenty of time.	Máš dosť času.
That would be the case here.	Tu by to tak bolo.
He's a really good guy.	Je to naozaj dobrý chlap.
When he returned, it was too late.	Keď sa vrátil, bolo už neskoro.
Something like that and this.	Niečo také a toto.
That's all for today.	Tak a to je na dnes všetko.
He wasn't actually there.	V skutočnosti tam nebol.
He will go to school.	Pôjde do školy.
It's all you.	To si celý ty.
I learned a lot from him.	Veľa som sa od neho naučil.
I have to do something.	Musím niečo urobiť.
And so here.	A tak tu.
I was there for the first time.	Bol som tam prvýkrát.
I don't know how he does it.	Neviem ako to robí.
But that's not good.	Ale to nie je dobré.
A a a.	A a a.
And he wasn't old.	A nebol starý.
I didn't mean any of that.	Nič z toho som nemyslel.
Yes, her father is there.	Áno, je tam jej otec.
Maybe he never would have been.	Možno by nikdy nebol.
It was really different.	Bolo to naozaj iné.
It's not even for me, really.	To ani nie je pre mňa, naozaj.
I got out of it.	Dostal som sa z toho.
I do not have time.	nemám čas.
I should do it.	Mal by som to urobiť.
Actually there is one.	V skutočnosti je jeden.
Now it's just you and me.	Teraz sme tu len ty a ja.
It was more.	Bolo to viac.
Still not.	Stále nie.
But there was something else.	Bolo tu však niečo iné.
I don't want to see this.	Toto nechcem vidieť.
They were on their own.	Boli na to sami.
One.	Jeden.
I thought that's how it should be done.	Myslel som si, že takto sa to má robiť.
These are.	Toto sú.
This was still his home.	Toto bol stále jeho dom.
She was with me even when she was gone.	Bola so mnou, aj keď bola preč.
And maybe they did.	A možno aj urobili.
It happened every morning.	Stalo sa to ráno čo ráno.
She should.	Mala by to tak.

It is not visible.	Nie je vidieť.

And always will be.	A vždy bude.
He has to do it all himself.	Musí to všetko urobiť sám.

He expected more.	Čakal viac.
He must have seen the truth.	Musel vidieť pravdu.
She will have a baby soon.	Čoskoro bude mať dieťa.
Maybe it was the first time.	Možno to bolo prvýkrát.
But that's not the case anymore.	Ale už to tak nie je.
They wanted to.	Chceli .

It really happened.	Naozaj sa to stalo.
She said it was good.	Povedala, že to bolo dobré.
Yes, that's exactly what she would do.	Áno, presne to by urobila.
He was a really good man.	Bol to skutočne dobrý človek.

He had to do something.	Musel niečo urobiť.
He said a lot was true.	Povedal, že veľa je pravda.
Not for long.	Nie tak dlho.
I have to say.	Musím povedať.

She was glad she was coming.	Bola rada, že ide.
It can be difficult to find.	Môže byť ťažké nájsť.

But it will still come.	Ale to ešte len príde.
Someone had to tell you.	Niekto ti to musel povedať.
But it wasn't good enough.	Ale nebolo to dosť dobré.
He just wasn't ready to see it.	Len nebol pripravený to vidieť.
This is her advice.	Toto je jej rada.
But tell me this.	Ale povedz mi toto.
it's not.	nie je.
You would be surprised.	Bol by si prekvapený.
He realized he had come.	Uvedomil si, že prišiel.

There's not much to say.	Nie je toho veľa čo povedať.
I came yesterday.	Prišiel sem včera.
I think that's true.	Myslím, že je to pravda.

It's good if something goes.	Je dobré, ak niečo ide.
But it's not like that.	Ale nie je to tak.
Are you sure you want to do this?	Si si istý, že to chceš urobiť?
You have to put in the work.	Musíte dať prácu.
I told him things, but not the truth.	Povedal som mu veci, ale nie pravdu.
You are like your father.	Si ako tvoj otec.
I am I.	Ja som ja.

He didn't tell me much at all.	Vôbec mi toho veľa nepovedal.

That's what he has.	To je to, čo má.

I need it now.	Teraz to potrebujem.
But no luck.	Ale žiadne šťastie.
I do not have it.	ja to nemám.
You will tell me.	Budeš mi to hovoriť.
He couldn't quite believe it.	Nemohol tomu celkom uveriť.

It's one.	Je to jeden.
I'm glad what happened happened.	Som rád, že sa stalo, čo sa stalo.

I've had enough.	Mal som dosť.
This is difficult.	Toto je ťažké.

You got me there.	Dostal si ma tam.
This was also like this.	Aj toto bolo takto.

It was so hard.	Bolo to také ťažké.
You could see it.	Mohli ste to vidieť.
There is nothing that one should not know.	Nie je nič, čo by človek nemal vedieť.
I don't think anyone should.	Myslím, že nikto by nemal.
It has to stay that way.	Musí to tak zostať.
I don't think he's serious.	Nemyslím si, že to myslí vážne.
I thought of everything.	Myslel som na všetko.
Everything is fine, really.	Všetko je v poriadku, naozaj.
This was mine.	Toto bolo moje.
I saw it here, here and here.	Videl som to tu, tu a tu.
But it's not just that.	Ale nie je to len tak.
He did and saw nothing.	Urobil a nič nevidel.
It was difficult.	Bolo to ťažké.
No, it wasn't.	Nie, nebolo.
I do not want to talk about it.	Nechcem o tom hovoriť.

You have to see this.	Toto musíte vidieť.
It is here!	Je to tu!

But that's exactly what happened.	Ale zdá sa, že presne to sa stalo.
He is fine now.	Teraz je v poriadku.
What is the reason.	Čo je ten dôvod.
That has already happened.	To sa už stalo.
It was a good thing he hadn't.	Bolo dobré, že nemal.
He was old.	Bol starý.
You have to do something yourself.	Musíte niečo urobiť sami.
Until then.	Až do toho.
He says yes.	Hovorí, že áno.
What is it? 	Čo je to?
That's good, if you wanted to.	Tak to je dobré, ak si to chcel.
Why are more and more people coming here?	Prečo sem chodí stále viac ľudí?
Really.	Naozaj.
But he really helped me.	Ale naozaj mi pomohol.
Something was wrong.	Niečo nebolo v poriadku.
Who would have thought that the old man was evil too.	Kto by si myslel, že ten starý muž bol tiež zlý.
I've waited too long for this moment.	Na túto chvíľu som čakal príliš dlho.

He seems very sure.	Zdá sa, že je veľmi istý.
He'll wait when you're ready.	Bude čakať, keď budeš pripravený.
We'll be there soon.	Čoskoro tam budeme.
Someone behind it.	Niekto za tým.
You couldn't do that now.	Teraz si to nemohol urobiť.
The problem is.	Problém je.
And sometimes it happened.	A niekedy sa aj stalo.
But there was a chance.	Ale bola tu šanca.
I saw them play.	Videl som ich hrať.
He's fine.	Ide mu to dobre.
We were early.	Boli sme skoro.
She really needs to sleep later.	Naozaj potrebuje spať neskôr.
It's new here.	Je tu nový.
That was my life.	To bol môj život.
I don't know why, but it's true.	Neviem prečo, ale je to pravda.
I know who it is.	Viem kto to je.
You know better.	Ty to vieš lepšie.
This is not the place.	Toto nie je miesto.
I got home.	Dostal som sa domov.
No one should find him here.	Nikto by ho tu nemal nájsť.
I didn't do anything.	Nič som neurobil.
It's just what's going on.	Je to len to, čo sa deje.
As it looks.	Tak ako to vyzerá.
I was wondering what was going on.	Bol som zvedavý, čo sa deje.
This is.	Toto je.
However, he did not know what else to do.	Nevedel však, čo iné robiť.
Just three of it.	Len tri z toho.
She said it again.	Povedala to znova.
He was surprised.	Bol prekvapený.
That is simply not true.	To jednoducho nie je pravda.
It seemed so.	Zdalo sa, že áno.
you are?	si ty?
I know it's late.	Viem, že je neskoro.
He wouldn't know where he was.	Nevedel by, kde je.
That was not yes.	To nebolo áno.
It was supposed to be mine.	Mal byť môj.
She was here now.	Teraz bola tu.
You have to see it for yourself.	Musíte to vidieť sami.
Maybe they did something wrong.	Možno urobili niečo zle.
My friend told me everything would be fine.	Môj priateľ mi povedal, že všetko bude v poriadku.
Not once.	Ani raz.
I would like to.	Bol by som rád.
There is no more food.	Už nie je jedlo.

Actually, it won't.	V skutočnosti nebude.
If you want to talk to us, fine.	Ak sa s nami chcete porozprávať, dobre.
I said anyway.	Aj tak som povedal.
You will have more work to do.	Budeš mať viac práce.
But you've probably heard it.	Ale asi si to počul.
Maybe not.	Možno nie.
You should have seen them.	Mali ste ich vidieť.
There were some, but not many.	Nejaké boli, ale nebolo ich veľa.
It was so hard.	Bolo to také ťažké.
There is a lot of work.	Je tu veľa práce.
She was never mine.	Nikdy nebola moja.
This could definitely be a problem.	Toto by určite mohol byť problém.
So go ahead.	Tak do toho.
This is also very good.	To je tiež veľmi dobré.
It's just my idea.	Je to len môj nápad.
I just wanted some.	Chcel som len nejaké.
He was human.	Bol to človek.
Someone you could talk to.	Niekto, s kým by ste sa mohli porozprávať.
I'm surprised how well it goes.	Som prekvapený, ako dobre to ide.
Now we had a good time.	Teraz sme sa mali dobre.
I just thought it would be good to see you.	Len som si myslel, že by bolo dobré ťa vidieť.
He knew it was coming.	Vedel, že to príde.
Who we were.	Kto sme boli.
But there is something else.	Ale je tu aj niečo iné.
Where are we.	Kde sme.
They never did.	Nikdy nemali.
As in, right now.	Ako v, práve teraz.
I knew exactly what to do.	Vedel som presne, čo mám robiť.
That's the problem.	To je ten problém.
This was good.	Toto bolo dobré.
Not everyone can.	Nie každý môže.
Someone who was up to no good.	Niekto, kto nemal nič dobré.
But that's what it's all about.	Však o to ide.
It wasn't.	To nebolo.
You don't want to go either.	Ani ty nechceš ísť.
Like, good man.	Ako, človek dobrý.
We will be able to see it.	Budeme to môcť vidieť.
But they are not here.	Ale nie sú tu.

Maybe not.	O tom možno nie.
I could have.	mohol som mať.
There is probably something wrong.	Asi tu nie je niečo v poriadku.
Everything takes time.	Všetko chce čas.
He saw what he was not supposed to see.	Videl to, čo vidieť nemal.
it's not okay.	nie je to v poriadku.
It seems that.	Zdá sa, že.
Like you right now.	Ako ty práve teraz.

Many people have this problem.	Tento problém má veľa ľudí.
Not something like that.	Nie niečo také.
You have to get it, get it, get it!	Musíte to dostať, dostať to, dostať to!
Not a little bit.	Ani trochu.
I would say no.	Povedal by som, že nie.
I do not care.	je mi to jedno.
Maybe not.	Možno nie.
I'll have to do it myself.	Budem to musieť urobiť sám.
He would never be whole.	Nikdy by nebol celý.
There I am.	Tam som ja.
So this is what.	Tak toto je čo.
He arrived exactly this morning.	Prišiel presne v tento deň ráno.
Or maybe not.	Alebo možno nie.
I did it.	Urobil som to.
There is much more to it than just driving.	Je toho oveľa viac ako len šoférovať.
Not very, he quickly realized.	Nie veľmi, rýchlo si uvedomil.
He needs a car.	Potrebuje auto.
What else do I have to do here?	Čo tu ešte musím urobiť.
You just left it.	Práve si to nechal.
I shouldn't do this.	Toto by som nemal robiť.
If only he had told her.	Keby jej to len povedal.
This is not the case now.	Teraz to tak nie je.
That was quite often.	Tak to bolo dosť často.
Just like yesterday.	Presne ako včera.
We might know.	Mohli by sme vedieť.
It was all different now.	Všetko to bolo teraz iné.
We have other things to do.	Máme iné veci na práci.
He really couldn't do that.	To by naozaj nemohol.
I saw why.	Videl som prečo.
However, it is not.	To však nie je.
for sure	určite,
He's gone now.	Teraz je preč.
I do not know what's hapenning.	Neviem, čo sa deje.
I was so sure of it.	Bol som si tým taký istý.
I went for it.	Išiel som do toho.
And the one before.	A ten predtým.

He always came back.	Vždy sa vrátil.
I haven't seen him in a long time.	Už som ho dlho nevidel.
I thought you were right.	Myslel som si, že máš pravdu.
There was something in it.	Niečo v tom bolo.
I still had a job.	Stále som mala prácu.
That's how she did it.	Tak to urobila.
He was so tired.	Bol taký unavený.
Everyone knows that.	Každý to vie.
Now it seemed he would have to do just that.	Teraz sa zdalo, že bude musieť urobiť práve to.
I don't want him to leave yet.	Ešte nechcem, aby odišiel.
It certainly wasn't for me.	Pre mňa to určite nebolo.
Want to see how it's done?.	Chcete vidieť, ako sa to robí?.
He did as he wanted.	Robil ako chcel.
He was glad she did it that way.	Bol rád, že to takto urobila.
But there is another reason why we have to go there.	Ale je tu ešte jeden dôvod, prečo tam musíme ísť.
You'll be fine.	Budeš v poriadku.
He would know.	Vedel by to.
She doesn't like help.	Nemá rada pomoc.

It must have been different.	Určite to bolo iné.
And we will have help.	A budeme mať pomoc.
really? 	vážne?

I think I could get into it.	Myslím, že by som sa do toho mohol dostať.
He knew.	Vedel.
Maybe I did something else.	Možno som urobil niečo iné.
But not there.	Ale nie tam.
If you can talk about it.	Ak o tom môžete hovoriť.
It would be the first time this had happened.	Bolo by to prvýkrát, keby sa tak stalo.
But there is still time.	Ale ešte je čas.

If you are to.	Ak ste do.
However, I hope that help will come.	Dúfam však, že pomoc príde.
And that was about it.	A to bolo asi tak všetko.

We've been together for three years.	Sme spolu tri roky.
I've always been curious about this.	Na toto som bol vždy zvedavý.
I kind of do.	Ja tak trochu áno.

My father was just as bad.	Môj otec bol rovnako zlý.
I did what you said.	Urobil som, čo si povedal.
And really, there is much more.	A naozaj, je toho oveľa viac.
I did it myself.	Sám som to urobil.
Always, always, always.	Vždy, vždy, vždy.
The food was pretty good though.	Jedlo však bolo celkom dobré.
I don't know what for.	Neviem za čo.
But it's hard.	Ale je to ťažké.
He can't be gone.	Nemôže byť preč.
I have no problem with that.	S tým nemám problém.
They wanted him to do something.	Chceli, aby niečo urobil.
Here's all he had to say.	Tu je všetko, čo mal povedať.
Here and there.	Tu a tam.
I think you're one.	Myslím, že si jeden.
But maybe it's just as good.	Ale možno je to rovnako dobré.
Morning.	Ráno.
I guess it doesn't matter.	Asi je to jedno.
This is just for us.	Toto je len pre nás.
You're on your own.	Si na to sám.
It is true.	To je pravda.
I know how it is.	Viem ako to je.
You just want to get out.	Chceš sa len dostať von.

It is very, very difficult to talk about.	Je veľmi, veľmi ťažké o tom hovoriť.
Exactly what you want.	Presne to, čo chcete.
I had to do.	Musel som urobiť.
He himself was not much better at it.	Sám na tom nebol oveľa lepšie.
That one.	Ten jeden.
Tell me again.	Povedz mi to znova.
In fact, it was so.	V skutočnosti to tak bolo.
But that's not what's going on here.	Ale to nie je to, čo sa tu deje.
It's entirely up to you.	Je to úplne na vás.
No one seems to know what's going on.	Zdá sa, že nikto nevie, čo sa deje.
But he was also lucky.	Mal však aj šťastie.
But I was happy.	Bol som však šťastný.
We would be together.	Boli by sme spolu.
I like this job.	Mám rád túto prácu.
But maybe not.	Ale možno nie.

We would like to have more of them.	Chceli by sme ich mať viac.

I came home late again.	Opäť som prišiel domov neskoro.
I just want you to know.	Len chcem, aby si to vedel.

He was.	Bol.
Everything was as it should be.	Všetko bolo ako má byť.
I need to see something.	Potrebujem niečo vidieť.
However, there seems to be a problem.	Zdá sa však, že je tu problém.

They were already gone.	Už boli preč.
I don't know if we should help him.	Neviem, či mu máme pomôcť.
This is not a good movie.	Toto nie je dobrý film.
I quite like them.	Mám ich celkom rád.
Just a father.	Len otec.
Maybe he was right.	Možno mal pravdu.
But it wasn't from him.	Nebolo to však od neho.
But not too busy.	Ale nie príliš zaneprázdnený.
It seemed to me that there should be a couple.	Zdalo sa mi, že by mali byť pár.
Someone left it here.	Niekto to tu nechal.
In fact, quite a lot of money.	V skutočnosti dosť veľa peňazí.
He's after me.	Ide po mňa.
Not a day.	Nie deň.
It's been too long.	Už to bolo príliš dlho.
He had plenty of time.	Mal dosť času.
I already know what is good.	Už viem, čo je dobré.
But there were three.	Ale boli tri.
He could always tell.	Vždy vedel povedať.
Maybe that's what they wanted.	Možno to tak chceli.
I had such a good life.	Mal som taký dobrý život.
I was thinking about this.	Myslel som na toto.
But it was too late.	Ale už bolo neskoro.
There was nothing else he could do.	Nič iné robiť nemohol.
Everyone knew.	Každý vedel.
He's heard this before.	Toto už počul.
You have to find them.	Musíte ich nájsť.
But not today.	Nie však dnes.
He tells me that all the time.	Hovorí mi to stále.
Neither of us was sure what to say.	Ani jeden z nás si nebol istý, čo povedať.

Not that he could do anything about it.	Nie že by s tým mohol niečo urobiť.

But they could have known.	Ale mohli to vedieť.
This is also good.	Je toto také dobré.
It was almost there anyway.	Aj tak bolo skoro.
He decided what to do.	Rozhodol sa, čo bude robiť.
He could, but he did as he had to.	Mohol, ale urobiť, ako musel.
He can figure out what to do with it.	Vie prísť na to, čo s tým robiť.

And it didn't matter.	A bolo to jedno.

He didn't think where he was.	Nemyslel na to, kde bol.

So this is very good for that.	Tak toto je na to veľmi dobré.
I know you were just a good friend.	Viem, že si bol len dobrý priateľ.
Every single one of us.	Každý jeden z nás.
You said he talked to you.	Povedal si, že s tebou hovoril.

He said well.	Povedal dobre.
There are many.	Je ich veľa.

I wasn't here last year.	Minulý rok som tu nebol.
It does not matter.	To je jedno.
I've never seen it before.	Nikdy predtým som to nevidel.
We have to win this.	Toto musíme vyhrať.
And no one has ever seen that.	A to nikto nikdy nevidel.
I think not.	Myslím, že nie.
This is definitely not luck.	Toto určite nie je šťastie.
That's exactly what we're after.	Presne o to nám ide.

When he wants to do something, he does it.	Keď chce niečo urobiť, urobí to.
I'm not out.	nie som vonku.

What's wrong with you? 	Čo sa s tebou deje?
he asked.	spýtal sa.

We are here for that.	Na to sme tu.
I should never have told you that.	Nikdy som ti to nemal povedať.
I know that already.	Už to viem.

No, he couldn't speak right now.	Nie, práve teraz nemohol hovoriť.

That may not be true for you.	Pre vás to nemusí byť pravda.
It's not a bad idea.	Nie je to zlý nápad.

Or maybe.	Alebo možno.
Tell me why.	Povedz mi prečo.

It wasn't a movie, so it wasn't.	Nebol to film, a tak ani nebol.
I'm going to get you back.	Idem ťa dostať späť.

Or right now.	Alebo práve teraz.
It's not the way it is.	Nie je to tak, ako to je.
Do you think you could eat like this?	Myslíte si, že by ste mohli jesť takto?

So who is it?	Tak kto to je?
But too long.	Ale príliš dlho.

I knew it was happening.	Vedel som, že sa to deje.
That would be like your father.	To by bolo ako tvoj otec.

Not really.	Naozaj nie.
We should go now.	Už by sme mali ísť.

Everything is there.	Všetko je tam.
That was a good movie.	To bol dobrý film.
More than a lot.	Viac ako veľa.
I want to see it now.	Chcem to teraz vidieť.
But really, this was better.	Ale naozaj, toto bolo lepšie.
I can't help.	Nemôžem pomôcť.
Everyone would hear it.	Každý by to počul.
How he looked.	Ako vyzeral.
He says he needs to talk to me.	Hovorí, že sa so mnou musí porozprávať.
Money, money, money.	Peniaze, peniaze, peniaze.
That's how he was.	Taký bol.
Not that anyone has that kind of time.	Nie že by mal niekto na niečo také čas.
I just learned.	Práve som sa naučil.
He would never do that.	Nikdy by to neurobil.
This may or may not be the case.	To môže byť aj nemusí.
You know what it's like.	Vieš aký je.
I want this.	Toto chcem.
He knew what he needed.	Vedel, čo potrebuje.
But we are never alone, not really.	Ale nikdy nie sme sami, naozaj nie.
But better than nothing.	Ale lepšie ako nič.
I want to say something else.	Chcem povedať niečo iné.
All that, as they say, and more.	To všetko, ako sa hovorí, a ešte viac.
Go to work.	Ísť do práce.
I can't quite figure it out.	Neviem na to celkom prísť.
I need you to come after me.	Potrebujem, aby si po mňa prišiel.
Maybe he was already here.	Možno tu už bol.
It would always be that way.	Vždy by to tak bolo.
This is going to be hard.	Toto bude ťažké.
What do you think you should do?	Čo si myslíte, že by ste mali urobiť.
If only he knew what was really going on.	Keby len vedel, čo sa v skutočnosti deje.
But I think it would be pretty good.	Myslím si však, že by to bolo celkom dobré.
A lot has happened.	Stalo sa toho veľa.
In fact, he had nothing to do here.	V skutočnosti tu nemal čo robiť.
That is all.	To je všetko.
There's one more.	Je tu ešte jeden.
And they were right.	A mali pravdu.
She was gone.	Bola preč.
All this year.	Celý tento rok.
I can not help you.	Neviem ti pomôcť.
For help.	Pre pomoc.
He saw himself.	Videl sám seba.
These are really good.	Toto sú naozaj dobré.
More on that later.	Viac o tom neskôr.
I still can't believe anyone would do that.	Stále nemôžem uveriť, že by to niekto urobil.
I could have gone anyway.	Mohol som ísť tak či tak.
It's you.	To si ty.
He's surprised.	Je prekvapený.
Maybe it was luck.	Možno to bolo šťastie.
But it still happened.	Ale aj tak sa to stalo.
if	Ak
But it wasn't.	Ale nebolo.
They are, but gone right now.	Sú, ale práve teraz preč.
I am busy.	som zaneprázdnený.
They are simply there.	Jednoducho sú tam.
If not now, then when ?.	Ak nie teraz, tak kedy?.
He just has to play with me.	Musí sa so mnou len hrať.
But it wasn't a child.	Ale nebolo to dieťa.
Just one problem.	Len jeden problém.
Maybe this too.	Možno aj toto.
.	.
Now things are different.	Teraz sú veci iné.
I heard you shouldn't have any.	Počul som, že by si nemal mať žiadne.
This will happen to you.	To sa vám stane.
But it wasn't like that for him.	Ale pre neho to tak nebolo.
They just did it, and that was it.	Jednoducho to urobili, a to bolo všetko.
I don't think so.	Myslím, že nemá.
Eat long.	Dlho jesť.
It never has to.	Nikdy nemusí.
More of that, please.	Viac toho, prosím.
He said to do it together.	Povedal, aby sme to urobili spolu.
But that was not all.	Ale nebolo to všetko.
It is not truth.	Nie je to pravda.
It's just true.	Je to jednoducho pravda.
What seems to be with you, he says.	Zdá sa, že čo je s tebou, hovorí.
It was very difficult.	Bolo to veľmi ťažké.
I can speak now.	Teraz môžem hovoriť.
But you have to get away.	Ale musíte sa dostať preč.
And that may be true.	A to môže byť pravda.
Probably.	Pravdepodobne.
He didn't know he knew.	Nevedel, že to vie.
He had nothing to say.	Nemal čo povedať.
I said good.	Povedal som dobre.
I should have had a job.	Mal som mať prácu.
He said nothing about it.	Nič k tomu nepovedal.
You're good at it.	Si v tom dobrý.
I'm not so sure anymore.	už si nie som taký istý.
Here we are.	Tu sme.
Maybe he can't tell me how to do it.	Možno mi nevie povedať, ako sa má.
This was usually not the case.	Zvyčajne to tak nebolo.
You could go to school if you wanted to.	Mohol by si ísť do školy, keby si chcel.
I think that could be a problem.	Myslím, že by to mohol byť problém.
I do not have a problem with that.	Nemám s tým problém.
He wanted that too.	Aj to chcel.
Nobody had anything to say.	Nikto nemal čo povedať.
I'm going to a party.	Idem na párty.
And it was.	A bolo to.
I think you're right.	Myslím, že máš pravdu.
I am gonna be fine.	Budem v poriadku.
Life is what you want it to be.	Život je taký, aký ho chceš mať.
But that's life.	Ale taký je život.
He must do this.	Toto musí urobiť.
I would do it.	urobil by som to.
As must.	Ako musí.
I know he would.	Viem, že by to urobil.
But there will be something to it.	Ale niečo na tom bude.
Von.	Von.
Maybe he'll be gone in a year.	Možno o rok bude preč.
He likes to play outside.	Rád sa hrá vonku.
They just aren't there.	Len tam nie sú.
He had where to be.	Mal kde byť.
This is not true.	Toto nie je pravda.
I wonder where everyone was.	Zaujímalo by ma, kde kto bol.
That's the point here.	O to tu ide.
He probably thought it was better than it actually was.	Pravdepodobne si myslel, že je to lepšie, ako to v skutočnosti bolo.
Here's the money.	Tu sú peniaze.
House.	Dom.
It happened to me.	Stalo sa mi to.
It was such a place.	Bolo to také miesto.
Almost three years.	Takmer tri roky.
And he felt it too.	A cítil to tiež.
But I can't find it.	Ale neviem to nájsť.
So she said.	Tak povedala.
Maybe he's right.	Možno má pravdu.
This can happen here.	Tu sa to môže stať.
How did that happen? 	Ako sa to stalo?
See me as food.	Vidieť ma ako jedlo.
I wondered how old he was.	Zaujímalo ma, koľko je rokov.
We all have them.	Všetci ich máme.
We have to play well.	Musíme hrať dobre.
But that was completely different.	Ale to bolo úplne iné.
He had everything.	Mal všetko.
I certainly do.	ja určite áno.
She probably should have.	Kedysi by to asi mala.
There was a child.	Bolo tam dieťa.
But only for a moment.	Ale len na chvíľu.
I knew it now or never.	Vedel som, že teraz alebo nikdy.
No one could.	Nikto nemohol.
But something was there.	Ale niečo tam bolo.
And we already have.	A už máme.
He was all that.	Tým všetkým bol.
It was a good day.	Bol to dobrý deň.
We can't do this.	Toto nemôžeme urobiť.
However, not everyone is like that.	Nie každý je však taký.

That's exactly how it should be.	Presne tak to má byť.
He had never been there before.	Nikdy predtým tam nebol.
If not today, then tomorrow.	Ak nie dnes, tak zajtra.
There is nothing but that.	Nie je nič iné, len to.
It was me too.	To som bol aj ja.
I really wanted to go this year.	Naozaj som chcel ísť tento rok.
I have something to do.	mám čo robiť.
I wasn't the only one.	Nebol som jediný.
You've done this to me before.	Predtým si mi to urobil.
Good thing he did.	Dobre, že tak urobil.
But probably yes.	Ale asi áno.
But not too fast.	Ale nie príliš rýchlo.
We seem to have there.	Zdá sa, že tam máme.
You were right.	Mali ste pravdu.
Now say it.	Teraz to povedz.
And his baby.	A jeho dieťa.
But no one said that.	Ale to nikto nepovedal.
Now everyone knew why.	Teraz už všetci vedeli prečo.
I said it.	Povedal som si to.

It's mine now.	Teraz je to moje.
I quite like him.	Mám ho celkom rada.
He's gone now.	Teraz je preč.

My father came home.	Otec prišiel domov.
Not that there is a problem with that.	Nie že by s tým bol problém.
There is no money.	Nie sú peniaze.
I don't think he liked me.	Myslím, že ma nemal rád.
You were sure of it.	Bol si tým istý.

This is much better.	Toto je oveľa lepšie.
I need to get it back.	Potrebujem to dostať späť.
It is too soon.	Ešte je skoro.

If he stayed here long enough.	Keby tu zostal dosť dlho.
It's already happened.	Už sa to stalo.
He told me, alone.	Povedal mi to, sám.
I don't know who it was.	Neviem, ktorý to bol.
That goes with us.	To ide s nami.
Everything is there.	Všetko je tam.
I have a better idea.	Mám lepší nápad.
It's hard to leave.	Je ťažké odísť.
We made it simple.	Urobili sme to jednoducho.
No, he's gone.	Nie, je preč.
He was my father.	Bol to môj otec.
I don't know where he is and what he does.	Neviem, kde je a čo robí.
That may be true.	To môže byť pravda.
This was there.	Bolo tam toto.
No, it's not good.	Nie, nie je to dobré.
You are mine.	Si môj.
That's too long.	To je príliš dlho.
That was her life.	To bol jej život.
But he is not like that now.	Ale teraz taký nie je.
I had no reason to talk to you like that.	Nemal som dôvod s tebou takto hovoriť.
Maybe he didn't want to talk about it.	Možno o tom nechcel hovoriť.
But that time is no longer.	Ale ten čas už nie je.

Exactly the same problem.	Presne ten istý problém.
I should have been here.	Mal som tu byť.
I thought there were only a few.	Myslel som, že ich je len pár.
And they did this.	A toto urobili.
Nobody wanted them.	Nikto ich nechcel.
And more.	A viac.
He was not right in himself.	Sám v sebe nemal pravdu.
But if not.	Ale ak to tak nie je.
He should know that.	To by musel vedieť.
I went for it.	Išiel som do toho.
Nobody wanted to buy it.	Nikto to nechcel kúpiť.
We can't say that.	Toto nemôžeme povedať.
It would still be long enough.	Aj tak by to bolo na dosť dlho.
You're here with me.	Si tu so mnou.
He said it was too late.	Povedal, že už je neskoro.
I want to know what happened.	Chcem vedieť, čo sa stalo.

What does he do.	Čo robí.
That will come now.	To príde teraz.
Except that's kind of true.	Až na to, že je to tak trochu pravda.
I want the baby.	Chcem to dieťa.
He was hers today.	Dnes bol jej.
He felt new.	Cítil sa nový.
What else can.	Čo iné môže.

I can't tell you what.	Neviem ti povedať čo.
But no!.	Ale nie!.
I just don't want to.	Len sa mi nechce.
I'm sure of it.	Som si tým istý.
And there was a good reason for that.	A bol na to dobrý dôvod.
He asked what had happened.	Spýtal sa, čo sa stalo.
There's a lot going on.	Veľa sa deje.
He saw that they were not good.	Videl, že nie sú dobré.
Just let him.	Len mu to dovoliť.
But that life was gone for me.	Ale ten život bol pre mňa preč.
That was hard.	To bolo ťažké.
None of this was good.	Nič z toho nebolo dobré.
But it wouldn't be good.	Ale nebolo by to dobré.
That's right, the party.	Presne tak, párty.
Now you're on your own.	Teraz si na to sám.
A lot.	Veľa.
He wanted her baby.	Chcel jej dieťa.
But it's too late.	Ale už je neskoro.
Yes it's true.	Áno, je to pravda.
I don't care what.	Je mi jedno čo.
Mali a.	Mali a.
That wouldn't be true.	To by nebola pravda.
We must go.	Musíme ísť.
Or he thinks he knows.	Alebo si myslí, že vie.
We never knew why.	Nikdy sme nevedeli prečo.
I'm not just lucky.	Nemám len šťastie.
That would be tomorrow.	To by bolo zajtra.
That is not good.	To nie je dobré.
And it seems not.	A zdá sa, že nie.

There cannot be more than one.	Nemôže byť viac ako jeden.
What is it? 	Čo je to?
I started very late.	Začal som veľmi neskoro.
I just don't know where they are.	Len neviem, kde sú.
, he is alone.	, sám je.
You had to leave, and that was it.	Musel si odísť a tak to bolo.
I don't know what's going to happen.	Neviem, čo sa má stať.
He never said what it was.	Nikdy nepovedal, čo to bolo.
Now and always.	Teraz a vždy.
We are his children.	Sme jeho deti.
No, it can't be, she told herself.	Nie, to nemôže byť, povedala si.
I don't want him to see it.	Nechcem, aby to videl.
I was there.	Bol som tam.

I'm not sure exactly why, but it's true.	Nie som si istý presne prečo, ale je to tak.

For a better life.	Pre lepší život.

I have talked.	hovoril som.
I'm just surprised.	Len som prekvapený.
And it wasn't good.	A nebolo to dobré.
It plays well.	Hrá sa dobre.
I am very well.	Mám sa veľmi dobre.
I think we did it.	Myslím, že sme to urobili.
I waited long enough.	Čakal som dosť dlho.
The problem was that they wanted to see me.	Problém bol v tom, že ma chceli vidieť.
I've never seen anything like it.	Nikdy som nič také nevidel.
But maybe it was.	Ale možno to tak bolo.
Maybe it's better that way.	Možno je to tak lepšie.
That was true.	To bola pravda.
It's nothing.	To nič nie je.
I know where it is.	viem kde to je.
He gave it to me.	Dal mi to.
does not have.	nemá.
He was at work.	Bol v práci.
In fact, there was nothing better, probably.	V skutočnosti nebolo nič lepšie, pravdepodobne.
So he came here.	Tak sem prišiel.
Not after .	Nie po .
And he got away with it.	A dal sa s tým preč.
Too much and too often.	Príliš veľa a príliš často.
I did it myself.	Urobil som to sám.
This can be better.	Toto môže byť lepšie.
I still have it too.	Aj ja ho mám stále.
I knew what he was trying to do.	Vedel som, o čo sa snaží.
But he was not the only one.	Nebol však jediný.
Neither knew what to do now.	Ani jeden nevedel, čo teraz robiť.
For something to do.	Za niečo robiť.
I've never had a guy like that before.	Taký chlap so mnou ešte nikdy nebol.
What was he like.	Aký bol.
He asked if he could come.	Spýtal sa, či môže prísť.
I sure would like to, you know.	Určite by som si to prial, vieš.
But he got over it pretty quickly.	Ale dostal sa z toho dosť rýchlo.
Everyone had their place here.	Tu mal každý svoje miesto.
They could be.	To by mohli byť.
He has to, whether he wants to or not.	Musí, či chce alebo nie.
It's always different.	Vždy je to iné.
Nobody was here.	Nikto tu nebol.
It's just.	Je to len.
I mean it quite seriously.	Myslím to celkom vážne.
I was still right.	Stále som mal pravdu.
Now was his chance.	Teraz tu bola jeho šanca.
He didn't know where he was and what he was.	Nevedel, kde je a čo je.
Which little.	Ktoré mala.
There is no other place.	Nie je tu žiadne iné miesto.
I just bought a house.	Práve som si kúpil dom.
He had to say something.	Musel niečo povedať.
I was waiting for someone.	Čakal som na niekoho.
There's life in it.	Je v tom život.
I haven't done it yet.	Ešte som to nerobil.
He needs to play like that.	Potrebuje hrať tak.
Now home again.	Teraz opäť doma.
If you want one.	Ak chcete jeden.
This is my father.	Toto je môj otec.
If only he could see me now.	Keby ma teraz mohol vidieť.
If he wanted to.	Keby chcel.
And here's why.	A tu je dôvod.
He goes to school there.	Tam chodí do školy.
But it is like that.	Ale je to tak.
Just as you are.	Tak, ako si len.
There just aren't enough of them.	Len ich nie je dosť.
No, never exactly, she said.	Nie, nikdy presne, povedala.
It can happen and it can happen soon.	Môže sa to stať a môže sa to stať čoskoro.
There is not much to say about yourself.	O sebe nie je veľa čo povedať.
He wasn't there himself.	Sám tam nebol.
And there are a lot of them.	A je ich veľa.
I just wanted you to think that.	Len som chcel, aby si si to myslel.
I think there is more to it.	Myslím, že je za tým viac.
It looks like that.	Vyzerá to tak.
This must be here, it must be there.	Toto tu musí byť, to tam musí byť.
In its entirety.	V jeho celkom.
He heard me.	Počul ma.
Or maybe he knew exactly where he was.	Alebo možno presne vedel, kde je.
But they had money.	Ale mali peniaze.
There is no time for that.	Nie je na to čas.
It doesn't get any better than this.	Už to nebude lepšie ako toto.
Man.	Muž.
It used to not be like that.	Kedysi to tak nebolo.
Maybe it was something else entirely.	Možno to bolo niečo úplne iné.
Go out tonight.	Ísť dnes večer von.
But enough was enough.	Ale dosť bolo.
We have years.	Máme už roky.
So he left it at that.	Tak to nechal tak.
Yes, it was.	Áno, bolo.
I am so glad.	Som tak rád.
This can be very good.	Veľmi dobre to tak môže byť.
I just did it last week.	Práve som to urobil minulý týždeň.
It looks good.	Vyzerá to dobre.
Everyone knows that.	Každý to vie.
You wanted to do something good.	Chceli ste urobiť niečo dobré.
They were gone now.	Teraz boli preč.
I could say.	Mohol by som povedať.
That too has to happen sooner or later.	Aj to sa skôr či neskôr musí stať.
It was just like that.	Len to tak bolo.
He was right.	Mal pravdu.
Today was me.	Dnes som to bol ja.
I'm glad it looks so good.	Som rád, že to vyzerá tak dobre.
That wasn't even true.	Ani to nebola pravda.
We have to tell the truth.	Musíme povedať pravdu.
I wish it wasn't like that.	Prial by som si, aby to tak nebolo.
It wasn't like now.	Nebolo to ako teraz.
It was good to be prepared.	Bolo dobré byť pripravený.
I can't work.	Nemôžem pracovať.
I can't find it now.	Teraz to neviem nájsť.
I guess she had a reason.	Asi mala dôvod.
I thought you might too.	Myslel som, že možno aj ty.
I hope you can help.	Dúfam, že môžete pomôcť.
He couldn't say that.	To nemohol povedať.
But it is also different.	Ale je to aj iné.
He was gone.	Bol preč.
He won't be ready.	Nebude pripravený.
You can give it to me.	Môžete mi ho dať.
I had to know.	Musel som to vedieť.
However, we did not know what to do.	Nevedeli sme však, čo robiť.
If you did, you could talk.	Ak by ste to urobili, mohli by ste hovoriť.
We wondered what happened.	Zaujímalo nás, čo sa stalo.
He didn't say that.	Toto nepovedal.
Now it has happened.	Teraz sa to stalo.
Maybe by tomorrow or more.	Možno do zajtra alebo ešte viac.
This is how it is done.	Takto sa to robí.
And he thinks so.	A myslí si to.
But that's not really the case.	Ale v skutočnosti to tak nie je.
Right here.	Presne tu.
It was like.	Bol ako.
There is nothing else.	Nie je nič iné.
Will be alright.	Bude v poriadku.
I haven't seen anyone.	Nikoho som nevidel.
They should be as good as they are now.	Mali by byť dobré tak, ako sú teraz.
They wanted him back.	Chceli ho späť.
Good for him if he can.	Dobré pre neho, ak pôjde.
I don't mean it.	Nemyslím vážne.
You'll be fine.	Budeš dosť v poriadku.
He just went with it.	Jednoducho s tým išiel.
Nobody.	Nikto.
I bought three.	Kúpil som si tri.
I didn't know what he was doing there.	Nevedel som, čo tam robí.
You must come.	Musíte prísť.
Sometimes he wants to do it.	Niekedy to chce urobiť.
The only one who could help her with that was her boyfriend.	Jediný, kto jej s tým mohol pomôcť, bol jej priateľ.
She had a job.	Mala prácu.
I saw it right away.	Hneď som to videl.
But it's nothing.	Ale to nič nie je.
But it doesn't have to be that way.	Ale nemusí to tak byť.
But that's not the only problem.	Ale to nie je jediný problém.
Just like you.	Taký ako si ty.
I had a lot.	Mal som toho veľa.
There's a lot going on this week.	Tento týždeň je toho veľa.
I left him there.	Nechal som ho tam.
He has a lot of them.	Má ich veľa.
He did it last year.	Urobil to minulý rok.
What is it.	To je čo.
All this just this year.	To všetko len tento rok.
I have too much.	Mám toho príliš veľa.
But for me.	Ale pre mňa.
Here we go.	Tu to máme.
Still.	Ešte.
This is something completely different.	Toto je niečo úplne iné.
This is really not true.	Toto naozaj nie je pravda.
The children are gone.	Deti sú preč.
I hope tomorrow will be a better day.	Dúfam, že zajtra bude lepší deň.
You can do as you wish.	Môžete robiť, ako chcete.
I don't know why it happened.	Neviem, prečo sa to stalo.
But he won't be able to stay here for long.	Nebude tu však môcť zostať dlho.
A lot, maybe.	Veľa, možno.
And there she was.	A tam bola.
See too much.	Vidieť príliš veľa.
I'm just going home.	Práve idem domov.
I'm just human, you know.	Som len človek, vieš.
He just wants to go to sleep.	Chce ísť len spať.
Exactly as he said.	Presne ako povedal.
I have to talk about it.	Musím o tom hovoriť.
Sometimes yes, sometimes no.	Niekedy áno, niekedy nie.
He returned to the matter.	Vrátil sa k veci.
Now this one.	Teraz tento.
He will be there, but he will not see him.	Bude tam, ale nebude ho vidieť.
Your father shouldn't have a problem with that.	Tvoj otec by s tým nemal mať problém.
Everyone needs help.	Každý potrebuje pomôcť.
She has done enough.	Urobila toho dosť.
I need to know if he's right.	Potrebujem vedieť, či má pravdu.
If we know that, we will know what to do.	Keď to budeme vedieť, budeme vedieť, čo robiť.
That happened to me.	To sa mi stalo.
She wasn't there.	Nebola tam.
This will happen.	Toto sa stane.
Will this happen?	Toto sa stane?
But it was good.	Ale bolo dobre.
He does it well.	Robí to dobre.
But it would still happen.	Ale aj tak by sa to stalo.
I can't say when.	Neviem povedať kedy.
And that's exactly what happens.	A presne to sa stane.
And soon.	A to čoskoro.
I don't want to stay.	Nechcem zostať.
I know it's nothing, but still.	Viem, že to nič nie je, ale aj tak.
It's true.	Je to pravda.
It was too good for that.	Na to bolo príliš dobré.
It would be different today.	Dnes by to bolo iné.
It's good to see.	Je dobré to vidieť.
I can't come up with anything in my life.	Za život nemôžem na niečo prísť.
I want you to do it for me.	Chcem, aby si to urobil pre mňa.
But that's exactly what I'm after.	Ale presne o to mi ide.
I don't even know what to do with it.	Ani neviem, čo s tým.
You can see it.	Môžete to vidieť.
That's what they did.	To je to, čo urobili.
Did you know?	Vedeli ste?
I just arrived.	Práve som prišiel.
They knew where they were.	Vedeli, kde sú.
They are not at home.	Nie sú doma.
It really happened.	Naozaj sa to stalo.
Maybe they were right, maybe not.	Možno mali pravdu, možno nie.
Lot of people.	Veľa ľudí.
Now I could do them very quickly.	Teraz by som ich mohol urobiť veľmi rýchlo.
Maybe you're right, he said.	Možno máš pravdu, povedal.
I had to give it to him.	Musel som mu to dať.
Maybe I can help.	Možno budem vedieť pomôcť.
And that's good.	A to je dobre.
A time that many people do not have.	Čas, ktorý veľa ľudí nemá.
I asked what was going on.	Spýtal som sa, čo sa deje.
I wouldn't say that to anyone.	To by som do nikoho nepovedal.
He's done it before.	Robil to už predtým.
But it's better than nothing.	Ale je to lepšie ako nič.
He wasn't sure he wanted to.	Nebol si istý, či to chce.
I hope you have it.	Dúfam, že to máš.
By being away.	Tým, že sú preč.
But I'm not quite sure how to do it.	Ale nie som si celkom istý, ako to urobiť.
It's hard for you to see.	Je pre vás ťažké to vidieť.
That and only that.	To a len to.
That's the reason.	To je dôvod.
And it was true.	A bola to pravda.
That's what you'd think, no.	To by si si myslel, nie.
I hope not.	Dúfam, že nie.
He couldn't stay to hear it.	Nemohol zostať, aby to počul.
And there are a lot of them.	A je ich veľa.
Nobody knew what could happen.	Nikto nevedel, čo sa môže stať.
It was too late to do anything about it.	Už bolo neskoro, aby s tým niečo urobili.
You are probably right.	Pravdepodobne máte pravdu.
I was glad I left.	Bol som rád, že som odišiel.
But the man was right.	Ale ten muž mal pravdu.
She did this.	Toto urobila.
Where is he at all.	Kde vôbec je.
We have to help.	Musíme pomôcť.
I am glad you are fine.	Som rád, že si v poriadku.
This is what he did to me.	Toto mi urobil.
I'm the reason why.	Ja som dôvod prečo.
He has to tell me what to do.	Musí mi povedať, čo mám robiť.
It's me and you.	To som ja a ty.
It was more than he ever did.	Bolo to viac, ako kedy urobil.
You think you want to see it.	Myslíš, že to chceš vidieť.
There is no such thing.	Nič také nie je.
I had nothing to say to her.	Nemal som jej čo povedať.
This is not just about you.	Toto nie je len o vás.
They loved you and wanted to be with you.	Mali ťa radi a chceli byť s tebou.
And if he could do it to you.	A keby ti to mohol urobiť.
There's a lot going on now.	Teraz je na tom celkom dosť.
I shouldn't have come.	Nemal som prísť.
That is all.	To je všetko.
He is not happy.	Nie je šťastný.
He didn't say what it was.	Čo to bolo, nepovedal.
Long time no see.	Dlho som ťa nevidel.
If you want to do something, you have to do it.	Ak chcete niečo urobiť, musíte to urobiť.
He kept saying how good it was to have them back.	Stále hovoril, aké dobré bolo mať ich späť.
This will go well.	Toto pôjde dobre.
It's not just for me.	Nie je to len pre mňa.
Talking about.	Hovorí o.

I did it.	Urobil som to.
It was good of him.	Bolo to od neho dobré.
I decided to.	Rozhodol som sa.
It's so good.	Je to tak dobré.
I knew he was in trouble.	Vedel som, že má problémy.
We have to go home.	Musíme ísť domov.
That's how lucky he was.	Takto mal šťastie.

I have three children.	Mám tri deti.

So now he waited.	Tak teraz čakal.
A lot of people do that.	Veľa ľudí to robí.
Everything is going well.	Všetko ide dobre.
And there he went.	A tam išiel.
Not tomorrow either.	Zajtra tiež nie.

You've been here for life.	Si tu na celý život.
I can't say why now.	Neviem teraz povedať prečo.
No, it wasn't right.	Nie, nebolo to v poriadku.
He had a job.	Mal prácu.
I knew he was right.	Vedel som, že má pravdu.
That's what we did last.	To je to, čo sme urobili naposledy.
No, for a couple.	Nie, pre pár.
The child can get here.	Dieťa sa môže dostať až sem.
For how kind a person is.	Za to, aký je človek rád.

I couldn't help myself.	Nemohol som si pomôcť.
The thing is, it can be.	Ide o to, že môže byť.
That's right now.	Teraz je to tak.
They really are.	Naozaj sú.
He was sure he did.	Bol si istý, že to urobil.
Tell me more.	Povedz mi viac.
This is not luck.	To nie je šťastie.
This one.	Tento, jediný.
I'm glad she did.	Som rád, že to urobila.
I had to find the child.	Musel som to dieťa nájsť.
We really should never have done them.	Naozaj sme ich nikdy nemali robiť.
It's too late for that.	Na to je už neskoro.
I'll be out in a minute.	O chvíľu budem vonku.
Her and his.	Jej a jeho.
He wouldn't be able to say anything.	Nebol by schopný nič povedať.
Things were like that for him.	Veci pre neho boli také.
You had a meeting.	Mali ste stretnutie.
All that time.	Celý ten čas.
I saw it now.	Teraz som to videl.
It may not be so today.	Dnes to tak možno nie je.
I'm not sure why he does it.	Nie som si istý, prečo to robí.
I would like to.	Rád by som.
But today was not the day.	Dnes však na to nebol deň.
This was nothing.	Toto nebolo nič.
I haven't seen you in almost a week.	Nevidel som ťa skoro týždeň.

But not today.	Ale nie dnes.
It is too much.	To je veľa.
He has no business knowing that.	Nemá čo robiť, aby to vedel.
But it doesn't have to be that way.	Ale nemusí to tak byť.
But it was okay.	Ale bolo to v poriadku.
You just know.	Len vieš.
She was sick of it.	Bolo jej z toho zle.
It's nothing serious.	Nie je to nič vážne.
This is how it is done.	Takto sa to robí.
Again, it could just be me.	Opäť to môžem byť len ja.
I really don't know what else to say.	Naozaj neviem, čo viac k tomu povedať.
But go ahead.	Ale do toho.
But I did it for a long time.	Robil som to však dlho.
It's not like we don't have them.	Nie je to tak, že by sme ich nemali.
We all have our things.	Všetci máme svoje veci.
But not really.	Ale v skutočnosti nie.
It does not matter.	To je jedno.
As must.	Ako musí.
We probably have too much work.	Asi máme príliš veľa práce.

He was waiting for me.	Čakal na mňa.
I'm sure he wants you to be happy.	Som si istý, že chce, aby si bol šťastný.

But you never knew.	Ale nikdy si nevedel.
So please.	Tak prosím .
And no one to help her.	A nikto, kto by jej pomohol.
for sure.	určite.
It was me who did it.	Bol som to ja, kto to urobil.
But you are.	Ale ty si.
He never said that.	Nikdy to nepovedal.
That's not much.	To nie je veľa.
Or maybe he wasn't.	Alebo možno nebol.
But here is something better.	Ale tu je niečo lepšie.
This can't happen, but it is, it's really happening.	Toto sa nemôže stať, ale je, naozaj sa to deje.
That we have some.	Že nejaké máme.
That's what happens.	To je to, čo sa stane.
And here you are.	A tu ste.
He has now.	Teraz má.
And that was only for a month.	A to bolo len na mesiac.
We were just kids.	Boli sme len deti.
Hours and hours away.	Hodiny a hodiny preč.
It goes fast.	Ide to rýchlo.
But it isn't.	Ale nie je.
He never had.	Nikdy nemal.
But that was the first time it had happened.	Ale to bolo prvýkrát, čo sa to stalo.
It's just you and me.	Si len ty a ja.
It's not something you have.	Nie je to niečo, čo máš.
I know he's only human.	Viem, že je to len človek.
I didn't see you and.	Nevidel som ťa a.
What's mine is his.	Čo je moje, to je jeho.
He didn't have enough work.	Nemal dosť práce.
I just need to get something inside.	Len potrebujem do seba niečo dostať.
I told him what happened to me.	Povedal som mu, čo sa mi stalo.
The only problem is, it's not here yet.	Jediný problém je, že tu ešte nie je.

You can always do it the night before.	Môžete to urobiť vždy večer predtým.

It wouldn't be the first time.	Nebolo by to prvýkrát.
We're so glad we did.	Sme tak radi, že sme to urobili.

Again, this is not true.	Opäť to nie je pravda.
And that's true.	A to je pravda.
I came to the meeting alone.	Na stretnutie som prišiel sám.
That's what they did to me.	To je to, čo mi urobili.
All the better for us.	O to lepšie pre nás.
I wanted to like it.	Chcel som to mať rád.

However, this is simply not true.	To však jednoducho nie je pravda.

So we're home.	Tak sme doma.
Maybe in a year.	Možno o rok.
He had it.	Mal to.
And you know it.	A ty to vieš.
He probably doesn't think it's time for that.	Asi si nemyslí, že je na to čas.
I'm never good enough.	Nikdy nie som dosť dobrý.
I felt whole.	Cítil som sa celý.

The time has come to have a baby.	Prišiel čas mať dieťa.
Indeed, it is.	Naozaj, je.

He will sleep with me.	Bude spať so mnou.
I do not like them.	nemám ich rada.
I didn't even see it.	Ani som to nevidel.

Here it was.	Tu to bolo.
I'm sure it will.	Som si istý, že bude.
And you should see what the guy looks like.	A mali by ste vidieť, ako ten chlap vyzerá.

I'm going to you.	Idem k vám.
He would know what to do.	Vedel by, čo robiť.
A lot I think not.	Veľa si myslím, že nie.
Not for us.	Nie pre nás.
He wasn't.	Nebol.

He didn't mean it like that.	Tak to nemyslel.
I hope mine does too.	Dúfam, že aj ten môj.
Just for a while.	Len na chvíľu.
I want to.	Chcem.
There was also something else.	Bolo tam aj niečo iné.

And maybe they should have.	A možno aj mali.
It seemed to him.	Zdalo sa mu.

These are just three.	Toto sú len tri.
And everyone is on it.	A všetci sú na tom.
Seriously, it's true.	Vážne, je to pravda.

I was no longer alone.	Už som nebol sám.
As if .	Ako keby .

I tried to find them.	Snažil som sa ich nájsť.
That's true and exactly.	To je pravda a presne.
This can't be good.	Toto nemôže byť dobré.
It goes like this.	Ide to takto.
He gets everything he wants.	Dostane všetko, čo chce.
Not that hard.	Nie také ťažké.
I think we will all play.	Myslím, že budeme hrať všetci.
I couldn't have that.	To som nemohol mať.
It will be gone.	Bude to preč.
And we can't have a job.	A nemôžeme mať prácu.
I think it would be.	Myslím, že by bolo.
I can get behind it.	Môžem sa za tým dostať.
But not if he was still busy.	Ale nie, ak bol stále zaneprázdnený.
I wanted her to be mine.	Chcel som, aby bola moja.
It just happened, that's all.	Jednoducho sa to stalo, to je všetko.
You should see it there.	Máš to tam vidieť.
I know it was good.	Viem, že to bolo dobré.
I'm just .	Som len .
He is only who he appears to be.	Je len tým, kým sa zdá byť.
We need to know what happened there.	Musíme vedieť, čo sa tam stalo.
You know he meant what he said.	Vieš, že to, čo povedal, myslel vážne.
Pretty good actually.	V skutočnosti celkom dobré.
You just had to go.	Len si musel ísť.
But it wasn't always like that.	Nebolo to však vždy tak.
Everyone knows we could.	Každý vie, že by sme mohli.
That was all he had to say to himself.	To bolo všetko, čo musel pre seba povedať.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Mohol robiť, čo chcel.
I didn't care.	Nebolo mi to jedno.
It should have been me.	Mal som to byť ja.
not who knows.	nie kto by vedel.
That she should do it sometime.	Že by to mala niekedy urobiť.
That way you can know what to do.	Takto môžete vedieť, čo máte robiť.
But if it's meant to be, it's meant to be.	Ale ak to tak má byť, tak to má byť.
If he did, he would tell her.	Keby to urobil, povedal by jej to.
That was once too much.	To bolo raz príliš veľa.
Like the one you're wearing.	Ako ten, ktorý máš na sebe.
The child too.	Dieťa tiež.
But he should do other things too.	Ale mal by robiť aj iné veci.
They both had money.	Obaja mali peniaze.
But who can say.	Ale kto môže povedať.
Maybe buy something.	Možno si niečo kúpiť.
It was a good year!.	Bol to dobrý rok!.
But I learned a lot.	Veľa som sa však naučil.
Go for it.	Tak do toho.
And for me too.	A pre mňa tiež.
Have a job.	Mať prácu.
No one was seen.	Nikoho nebolo vidieť.
I doubt it ever will.	Pochybujem, že to niekedy bude.
He did what he set out to do.	Urobil to, na čo prišiel.
This was no place for him.	Toto nebolo miesto pre neho.
But that's not why we're here.	Ale to nie je dôvod, prečo sme tu.
But it's not like you think.	Ale nie je to tak, ako si myslíš.
A man is happy if he has everything.	Muž je šťastný, ak má všetko.
His father might have.	Jeho otec možno áno.
I want to know what could be the problem.	Chcem vedieť v čom môže byť problém.
I certainly wouldn't think so.	To by som si určite nemyslel.
There is no other place for them to be.	Nie je iné miesto, kde by mohli byť.
I asked why.	Spýtal som sa prečo.
Now I was busy.	Teraz som bol zaneprázdnený.
He didn't tell him anything.	Nič mu nepovedal.
Here's your problem.	Tu je tvoj problém.
Something is happening here.	Niečo sa tu deje.
We have, we have.	Máme, máme.
He was interested in everything.	Všetko ho zaujímalo.
But nothing like that.	Ale nič také.
However, this is not the time to go for it.	Nie je však čas ísť do toho.
I was before.	Bol som predtým.
Okay, that's not true at all.	Dobre, to vôbec nie je pravda.
He always knew what he was thinking.	Vždy vedel, čo si myslí.
Just like a guy.	Presne ako chlap.
And that's okay.	A je to v poriadku.
Everyone wanted to be with him.	Každý chcel byť s ním.
There is only one good reason for this.	Je na to len jeden dobrý dôvod.
I need someone here.	Potrebujem tu niekoho.
So this is their day.	Tak toto je ich deň.
However, this does not seem to be the case.	Zdá sa však, že to tak nie je.
But last year alone.	Ale minulý rok sám.
It's not if.	Nie je to keby.
I have to do better.	Musím to urobiť lepšie.
So we did it.	Tak sme to urobili.
It's just good.	Je to jednoducho dobré.
Yes, this is my lucky day.	Áno, toto je môj šťastný deň.
You should have seen me before.	Mal si ma vidieť predtým.
A good time was had by all.	Všetci mali dobrý čas.
But that's all.	Ale to je všetko.
Nobody wants that to happen.	Nikto nechce, aby sa to stalo.
In fact, they still are.	V skutočnosti stále sú.
There would be nothing.	Nebolo by nič.
That's just fine.	To je len dobre.
how are you	Si ako ?
He could go home.	Mohol ísť domov.
Too fast, too fast.	Príliš rýchlo, príliš rýchlo.
John, that was me.	John, to som bol ja.
But he saw that it could not happen.	Ale videl, že sa to nemôže stať.
That was all she said.	To bolo všetko, čo povedala.
They are not here.	Nie sú tu.
But it seems that's not the case anymore.	Ale zdá sa, že to už nie je.
You can do better.	Môžete to urobiť lepšie.
Where are you?.	Kde si?.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Nemusí to tak byť.
Maybe that was the problem.	Možno to bol ten problém.
I started there as a brand new teacher.	Začal som tam ako úplne nový učiteľ.
They had too much.	Mali príliš veľa.
I never will never be.	Nikdy som nikdy nebude.
And again you can see what's going on.	A opäť môžete vidieť, čo sa deje.
He also helped her.	Tiež jej pomohol.
I'm sure he's right.	Som si istý, že má pravdu.
It goes out.	Ide to von.
You were there.	Bol si tam.
There is no reason to work.	Nie je dôvod pracovať.
I couldn't afford it.	Nemohol som si to dovoliť.

You thought wrong.	Myslel si zle.
They shouldn't do that.	Nemali by to robiť.
It made him sick.	Bolo mu z toho zle.
My only problem is.	Môj jediný problém je.
He says yes.	Hovorí áno.
Everything is for yourself.	Všetko je pre seba.
We have serious problems.	Máme vážne problémy.
Maybe it was the money.	Možno to boli peniaze.
But something is wrong with it.	Ale niečo na tom nie je v poriadku.
Like you.	Ako ty.
He just didn't care.	Len mu to bolo jedno.
I'm the same way.	som na tom rovnako.
He knew who it was from anyway.	Aj tak vedel, od koho to je.
Nobody here knows how to do it.	Nikto tu nevie ako na to.
But he doesn't.	Ale nemá.
I have work in the morning.	Ráno mám prácu.
We just were.	Len sme boli.
But it looks good.	Ale vyzerá to dobre.
That's what you should do.	To je to, čo by ste mali robiť.
I can say this.	Môžem povedať toto.
Yes, it does.	Áno, robí.
It's a good idea though.	Je to však dobrý nápad.
I think that must be true.	Myslím, že to musí byť pravda.
He meant it.	Myslel to vážne.
In one day.	Za jeden deň.
He was everything to me.	Bol pre mňa všetkým.
Not long, he realized.	Nie dlho, uvedomil si.
That's really the reason.	To je naozaj dôvod.
You didn't think.	Nemyslel si.
They didn't know about it.	Nevedeli o tom.
I would like to know what it is.	Chcel by som vedieť, čo to je.
He means well and tries hard.	Myslí to dobre a veľmi sa snaží.
It was a little hard, but good.	Bolo to trochu ťažké, ale dobré.
Even as a child.	Ešte ako dieťa.
You have to stick with it.	Musíte pri tom zostať.
I'm not sure what it is.	Nie som si istý, čo to je.
I was too late.	Bol som príliš neskoro.
I would expect that from him.	To by som od neho čakal.
He wasn't sure how that made him feel.	Nebol si istý, ako sa pri tom cítil.
We have to be better.	Musíme byť lepší.
I have to fix it.	Musím to dať do poriadku.
So you said it for me.	Tak si to povedal za mňa.
Nothing is too much.	Nič tam nie je príliš veľa.
You're not ready.	Nie si pripravený.
If she liked you, she would have you.	Keby ťa mala rada, mala by ťa.
He might still get it.	Možno to ešte dostane.
I just don't know how to do it.	Len neviem ako na to.
He came to help.	Prišiel pomôcť.
But all that was gone.	To všetko však bolo preč.
You were rather lucky.	Skôr si mal šťastie.
That's good enough.	To je dosť dobré.
And one knew it, felt it.	A človek to vedel, cítil.
I didn't want anyone to stay too long.	Nechcel som, aby niekto zostal príliš dlho.
I didn't do that.	Neurobil som tak.
He couldn't seem to get out of it.	Zdalo sa, že sa z toho nevedel dostať.
But not so soon.	Ale nie tak skoro.
We were in it.	Boli sme v tom.
No one can help anyone.	Nikto nemôže nikomu pomôcť.
You can leave.	Môžete odísť.
They were the same guy.	Boli to ten istý chlap.
But I can't get it to work.	Ale nemôžem to dostať do práce.
That's the only way it would happen.	Len tak by sa to stalo.
The children were at school.	Deti boli v škole.
We have to talk.	Musíme sa porozprávať.
.	.
I figured all this out on my own.	Na toto všetko som prišiel sám.
Exactly like this.	Presne takto.
That was all they could do.	To bolo všetko, čo mohli urobiť.
Maybe just stay.	Možno len zostať.
I did it myself.	Urobil som to sám.
None of this would be okay anymore.	Nič z toho by už nebolo v poriadku.
More than a week.	Viac ako týždeň.
It's also not exactly what you want.	Tiež to nie je presne to, čo chcete.
As he would later say.	Ako by neskôr povedal.
That was one.	To bol jeden.
I should have done better with him.	Mal som to s ním urobiť lepšie.
One is not.	Jeden nie je.
I always wanted to play.	Vždy som chcel hrať.
You should have left.	Mal si odísť.
I need it.	Potrebujem to.
We'll talk about it in the morning.	Budeme o tom hovoriť ráno.
You with me.	Ty so mnou.
It's too late now.	Teraz je už neskoro.
I felt it again.	Cítil som to znova.
Never has and probably never will.	Nikdy nemal a pravdepodobne ani nikdy nebude.
Maybe not her father.	Možno nie jej otec.
Everyone wants it.	Každý to chce.
It seems like yesterday.	Zdá sa mi to ako včera.
I got it though.	Dostal som to však.
It wasn't that hard either.	Ani to nebolo také ťažké.
It may help you.	Môže vám to pomôcť.
It's a bit late for us anyway.	Aj tak je pre nás trochu neskoro.
But it was a good movie.	Ale bol to dobrý film.
There was none yesterday.	Včera žiadne nebolo.
I'm not sure what he meant.	Nie som si istý, čo tým myslel.
Probably her teacher.	Pravdepodobne jej učiteľ.
Like you said.	Ako si povedal.
He likes people.	Má rád ľudí.
If so, it may still be there.	Ak áno, môže tam byť stále.
It may be too late.	Už môže byť neskoro.
They were all there.	Boli tam všetci.
That's what happened to me.	To je to, čo sa mi stalo.
And my week.	A môj týždeň.
That actually happened.	To sa skutočne stalo.
I can't figure out the problem.	Neviem prísť na problém.
So tired of it.	Tak unavený z toho.
But he wasn't ready, not yet.	Ale nebol pripravený, ešte nie.
They were lucky in that too.	Aj v tom mali šťastie.
Everyone had to come and be ready.	Každý musel prísť a byť pripravený.
So tell me.	Tak mi to povedz.
The only problem is.	Jediný problém je .
One came for him.	Jeden prišiel po neho.
But he was here.	Ale bol tu.
They had money.	Mali peniaze.
But yesterday was a good day for me.	Ale včera bol pre mňa dobrý deň.
And what a life it was.	A aký to bol život.
You have done so much for me.	Urobil si pre mňa tak veľa.
I've done it before.	Už som to robil.
And no one can believe it's true.	A nikto nemôže uveriť, že je to pravda.
Today will be different.	Dnes to bude iné.
He is not alone.	Nie je sám.
But it doesn't have to.	Ale nemusí.
I'm back here now.	Teraz som tu späť.
You gave me an idea.	Dal si mi nápad.
But we are still here.	Stále sme však tu.
Or maybe you don't care.	Alebo ti je to možno jedno.
I'm just tired now.	Teraz som len unavený.
His stuff is pretty good.	Jeho veci sú dosť dobré.
Maybe, but probably not.	Možno, ale pravdepodobne nie.
You can't let him.	Nemôžeš mu to dovoliť.
He stayed there for about a year.	Zostal tam asi rok.
The only problem is that it's not true.	Jediný problém je, že to nie je pravda.
Maybe it's not like that.	Možno to tak nie je.
I only told you one.	Povedal som ti len jeden.
That seems to be the point.	Zdá sa, že o to ide.
Nobody's happy, but nobody's going to do anything about it.	Nikto nie je šťastný, ale nikto s tým nič neurobí.
I just think it will.	Len si myslím, že bude.
It's not difficult.	Nie je to ťažké.
I wish he was here to see it.	Prial by som si, aby tu bol a videl to.
And in fact it is.	A v skutočnosti aj je.
I did it anyway.	Aj tak som to urobil.
But there was no time.	Ale nebol čas.
Pretty soon actually.	V skutočnosti dosť skoro.
That's not you.	To nie si ty.
She always had her way.	Vždy mala svoje.
I never meant to tell you like this.	Nikdy som ti to nechcel takto povedať.
You might want to do that, but anyway.	Možno to budete chcieť urobiť, ale tak či tak.
He had a reason to tell her.	Mal dôvod jej to povedať.
There would be no more.	Viac by už nebolo.
I don't think so.	Nemyslím si ich.
I will do it again.	Urobím to znova.
He really wasn't doing anything right now.	Naozaj teraz nič nerobil.

For my whole life.	Na celý môj život.
They all knew why they were here.	Všetci vedeli, prečo sú tu.
There won't be many more anyway.	Oveľa viac ich aj tak nebude.
We did a lot.	Urobili sme veľa.
But there is more going on.	Deje sa však viac.
It's not that hard.	To nie je také ťažké.
If you wanted to get out, you would.	Ak by ste sa chceli dostať von, urobili by ste to.
It just has to be all or nothing.	Len tam musí byť všetko alebo nič.
It also has .	Má tiež .
Sometimes yes.	Niekedy áno.
Not a single person.	Ani jeden človek.
But that's not all.	To však nie je všetko.
I'll do it later.	Urobím to neskôr.
And that's not okay.	A to nie je v poriadku.

A little better.	Trochu lepšie.
Maybe never.	Možno nikdy.
And he's not the only one who said that.	A nie je jediný, kto to povedal.

I have enough.	Mám dosť.

But it will be too late.	Ale to už bude neskoro.
Although everything seems to be fine.	Aj keď sa zdá, že je všetko v poriadku.
There must be something.	Niečo musí byť.
It was the way he wanted it.	Bolo to tak, ako to chcel.
I suspect they probably do.	Mám podozrenie, že asi áno.
It was true last night.	Včera večer to bola pravda.
You should have it.	Mali by ste ho mať.
How exactly is my life.	Ako je to presne môj život.
I learned a lot.	Veľa som sa naučil.
And probably more than once.	A pravdepodobne viac ako raz.
You should find a lot of them.	Mali by ste ich nájsť veľa.
But good.	Ale dobrý.
I'm not sure if it does.	Nie som si istý, či áno.
I waited a long time.	Čakal som dlho.
It was always hers.	Vždy to bolo jej.
That's what happened here.	To sa tu stalo.
He doesn't know where he is.	Nevie, kde je.
I know exactly what is what.	Presne viem, čo je čo.

I would be happy.	Bol by som šťastný.
But he knew she was worried about herself.	Vedel však, že sa bojí o seba.
But it wasn't like that.	Ale nebolo to tak.
He seems to know too much.	Zdá sa, že vie príliš veľa.
But that's neither here nor there.	Ale to nie je ani tu, ani tam.
He said he had.	Povedal, že mal.
This was a happy time.	Toto bol šťastný čas.
He got help.	Dostal pomoc.
I was everything.	Bol som všetko.
But maybe it was just as well.	Ale možno to bolo rovnako dobre.
They don't seem to be there.	Zdá sa, že tam nie sú.
Maybe he could be, too.	Možno by ním mohol byť tiež.
They wanted to go.	Chceli ísť.
Or I had my three children.	Alebo som mal moje tri deti.
And that's about it.	A to je asi tak všetko.
Not now.	Teraz už nie.
I don't know why this is happening.	Neviem, prečo sa to deje.

Time is time.	Čas je čas.
You want to have children.	Chcete mať deti.
You just have to want it.	Len to musíte chcieť.
That's what you thought.	To si si myslel.
If so, you would tell her the truth.	Ak áno, povedal by si jej pravdu.
I'm not sure where to go.	Nie som si istý, kam mám ísť.
I came here.	Prišiel som sem.
But sometimes it's okay to walk away.	Ale niekedy je v poriadku odísť.
He didn't care what happened to him.	Bolo mu jedno, čo sa mu stalo.
You can stay at home.	Môžete zostať doma.
But now it was gone, just like that.	Ale teraz to bolo preč, len tak.

I could be happy.	Mohol som byť šťastný.
He just has to do it.	Jednoducho to musí urobiť.
More about us here.	Viac o nás tu.

As fast as he can.	Tak rýchlo, ako môže.

Are you ready?.	Si pripravený?.
We all knew it.	Všetci sme to vedeli.

Nobody saw anything.	Nikto nič nevidel.
Yes, yes, exactly.	Áno, áno, presne.
Now it's every week.	Teraz je to každý týždeň.
Maybe you were right.	Možno si mal pravdu.
And that's not what he says.	A to nie je to, čo hovorí.
No one has a problem with that.	Nikto s tým nemá problém.
I can't figure out why that is.	Neviem prísť na to, prečo je to tak.
Maybe he was too old for the job.	Možno už bol na túto prácu príliš starý.
I like it.	Príde mi to.
I was there long enough to see it.	Bol som tam dosť dlho, aby som to videl.
The car will be here until tomorrow.	Auto tu bude do zajtra.

No, he was not.	Nie, nebol.
Not a little bit.	Ani trochu.
Here they are right here.	Tu sú práve tu.

But that's okay.	Ale to je v poriadku.

There are more of us and we are better off.	Je nás viac a je nám lepšie.
A good reason.	Dobrý dôvod.

Never.	Nikdy nie.
He heard it again.	Počul to znova.
Now was his chance.	Teraz bola jeho šanca.
Swim here and there and there.	Plávať tam a tam a tam.

It can wait.	Môže čakať.
I have to work.	Musím pracovať.
It's a good problem to have.	Je to dobrý problém mať.

You did everything.	Všetko si urobil.
This one too.	Aj tento.

It's like .	Je to ako .
That's my advice.	To je moja rada.

I'll be the guy.	Ja budem ten chlap.
I don't want that either.	To nechcem ani ja.
I'm going to see him in the evening.	Idem za ním večer.
But not this.	Ale toto nie.
I have to get them redone.	Musím si ich dať urobiť znova.

Not after what they did to me.	Nie po tom, čo mi urobili.
That can't be.	To nemôže byť.

It was more.	Bolo to viac.
I know what you want to talk about.	Viem, o čom chceš hovoriť.
And it seemed to me that it was.	A zdalo sa mi, že áno.

It's still good, but.	Stále je to dobré, ale.

It will never be again.	Už nikdy nebude.
It's not something that happens quickly.	Nie je to niečo, čo sa deje rýchlo.
This is not a new day.	Toto nie je nový deň.
I didn't know that.	Tak to som nevedel.
And you were.	A ty si bol.

Which is almost exactly what happened.	Čo sa takmer presne stalo.

I want you to be with me.	Chcem, aby si bol so mnou.

I want to get it there.	Chcem to tam dostať.

I have to go out.	Musím ísť von.

And he lost almost everything.	A takmer o všetko prišiel.

I doubt they were ever really together.	Pochybujem, že boli niekedy naozaj spolu.
Although not immediately.	Aj keď nie hneď.
Maybe you are right.	Možno máš pravdu.
It's probably better that way, she told herself.	Asi je to tak lepšie, povedala si.
There was no time to sleep, no reason to sleep.	Nebol čas spať, ani dôvod spať.
I saw him right away.	Hneď som ho videl.
You have to get there.	Musíte sa tam dostať.
I have the car here.	Auto mám tu.
I talked to him.	Hovoril som s ním.
Here it is different.	Tu je to iné.

But they could have had it last year as well.	Ale mohli ho mať aj minulý rok.
There's a chance it's not true.	Je tu šanca, že to nie je pravda.
It doesn't have to stay long!.	To nemusí zostať dlho!.
he said.	povedal.
I'm human too.	Aj ja som človek.
It wasn't good either.	Ani to nebolo dobré.
That was probably a bad idea.	To bol asi zlý nápad.

It was like that before.	Predtým to tak bolo.
I'm sure it's a house.	Som si istý, že je to dom.

But that doesn't matter.	To je však jedno.
I came here for the weekend.	Prišiel som sem na víkend.
It may happen sooner rather than later.	Môže sa to stať skôr ako neskôr.
No one can figure out what's going on.	Nikto nevie prísť na to, čo sa deje.
That's not really a problem anymore.	To už naozaj nie je problém.
I figured this out late last night.	Prišiel som na to včera neskoro večer.
Sometimes he tries to do too much.	Niekedy sa snaží robiť príliš veľa.
But I don't know how to do it.	Ale neviem ako na to.
It's an old house.	Je to starý dom.
That is simply not true at all.	To jednoducho vôbec nie je pravda.
What did you say.	Čo si povedal.
.	.
But it's too late.	Ale je príliš neskoro.
The problem is that it only happens once.	Problém je, že sa to stane len raz.
This man was.	Tento muž bol.
But yes, it happened.	Ale áno, stalo sa.
No one thought anyone would ever come here.	Nikto si nemyslel, že sem niekto niekedy príde.
This one should have no problems.	Tento by nemal mať žiadne problémy.
But nothing more.	Ale nič viac.
But which one?.	Ale ktorý?.
And it was better.	A bolo lepšie.
It's almost her time.	Už je skoro jej čas.
He should never have said such a thing.	Nikdy nemal nič také povedať.
This happens every single day.	Toto sa deje každý jeden deň.
They probably didn't know it was there.	Pravdepodobne nevedeli, že tam je.
That is not the case.	Tým to tak nie je.
No problems.	Žiadne problémy.
We have to play better.	Musíme hrať lepšie.
He was here, but he had to leave.	Bol tu, ale musel odísť.
he asked.	spýtal sa.
Now his life is at stake.	Teraz mu ide o život.
If you have one, you probably already knew.	Ak ho máte, pravdepodobne ste to už vedeli.
For me it would be later.	Pre mňa by to bolo neskôr.
She said what do you want.	Povedala, čo chceš.
What should he do now?	Čo má teraz robiť.
I shouldn't do that.	Nemal by som to robiť.
They already had children.	Už mali deti.
But you already know better.	Ale ty to už vieš lepšie.
You did well.	Urobili ste dobre.
They wanted everything for themselves.	Všetko chceli pre seba.
But this is something more.	Ale toto je niečo viac.
I think it was just fine.	Myslím, že to bolo jednoducho v poriadku.
Today, this week, this month and this year.	Dnes, tento týždeň, tento mesiac a tento rok.
Or with him.	Alebo s ním.
That was the whole problem.	To bol celý ten problém.
Maybe they were right.	Možno mali pravdu.
But you.	Ty však.
Maybe it's too early to tell.	Možno je príliš skoro hovoriť.
He already knows something is up.	Už vie, že sa niečo deje.
I will have you.	Budem ťa mať.
I want to give	chcem dať.
Although not for long.	Aj keď nie na dlho.
It can't be like that anymore.	Už to tak nemôže byť.

It's up to us.	Je to na nás.
Nobody wanted it.	Nikto to nechcel.
And again and again and again.	A znova a znova a znova.
I'm no use to you.	Nie som ti na nič.
That and nothing else.	To a nič iné.
But that is not always the case.	Ale nie vždy to tak je.
Did you have any problems?	Mali ste nejaké problémy?
She was still here.	Stále tu bola.
But you don't want to be here.	Ale ty tu nechceš byť.
He knows exactly what to do.	Presne vie, čo má robiť.
I am sure of it.	Som si tým istý.
But it wasn't always like that for me.	Ale nie vždy to tak bolo pre mňa.
Or maybe that's what you want.	Alebo možno práve to chcete.
And it was better than staying home alone.	A bolo to lepšie ako zostať sám doma.
And it never will be.	A nikdy nebude.
I always wanted to play.	Vždy som chcel hrať.
I think we have the same.	Myslím, že to máme rovnako.

It's not quite like that.	Nie je to celkom tak.
I would say yes.	Povedal by som, že áno.
Plays as .	Hrá ako .
And yes, they would know about it.	A áno, vedeli by o tom.
Please, what could be wrong with it.	Prosím, čo na tom môže byť.
But nobody knew.	Ale nikto nevedel.
I don't want to see.	Nechcem vidieť.
I was on my own.	Bol som na to sám.
It was all true.	Všetko to bola pravda.
It's still here.	Stále je tu.
One must eat.	Človek musí jesť.
This is a little different.	Toto je trochu iné.
We all have jobs here.	Všetci tu máme prácu.
He's a good kid.	Je to dobré dieťa.
Or, maybe it's just me.	Alebo, možno som to len ja.
Her father had it.	Mal to jej otec.
But it's you.	Ale si to ty.
No one has ever seen him either.	Nikto ho tiež nikdy nevidel.
I told her that too.	Povedal som jej to tiež.

And it really isn't.	A to naozaj nie je.
He knows no one was here.	Vie, že tu nikto nebol.
That's not okay.	To nie je v poriadku.
Well and good, but nothing more.	Dobre a dobre, ale nič viac.
You were before.	Boli ste predtým.

It can not be true.	To nemôže byť pravda.
Or maybe a year after that.	Alebo možno rok po tom.
Not good yet, but better.	Ešte nie dobre, ale lepšie.
Not that anyone cares.	Nie je to tak, že by to niekoho zaujímalo.
I'm in if you want me.	Som v tom, ak ma chceš.
We are not who we were.	Už nie sme tým, kým sme boli.
Not today, she told herself.	Dnes nie, povedala si.
Maybe they are.	Možno sú.

It's definitely not a problem.	Určite to nie je problém.
Which is a little different.	Čo je trochu iné.

What is wrong with me? 	Čo to so mnou je?
she said.	povedala.
She had to see people.	Mala ľudí vidieť.

I don't have time for that now.	Teraz na to nemám čas.
You're going to give me trouble.	Budeš mi robiť problémy.
You cant sleep.	Nemôžeš spať.

It's better this way.	Takto je to lepšie.
He went after it.	Išiel za tým.

I really couldn't tell you.	Naozaj by som ti to nevedel povedať.
This was the problem.	Tento bol problém.
He wasn't ready for this.	Na toto nebol pripravený.

He couldn't tell her.	Nemohol jej to povedať.
But you know better.	Ale ty to vieš lepšie.

It's not that hard.	Nie je to také ťažké.
He wished they were.	Prial si, aby boli.
You really.	Ty naozaj .

I thought my time had come.	Myslel som si, že prišiel môj čas.

I asked who.	Spýtal som sa koho.

I have one now.	Teraz jeden mám.
That we don't want anymore.	Že sa nám už nechce.
That's exactly what we like.	Presne to máme radi.
But maybe that's not even true.	Ale možno to ani nie je pravda.
It's always this.	Vždy je to toto.
You need to talk to him.	Musíte sa s ním porozprávať.

But that happens every day.	Ale to sa deje každý deň.

I did a lot of work for him here.	Urobil som tu pre neho veľa práce.
The couple has no children.	Pár nemá deti.
Maybe he shouldn't have said that.	Možno to nemal povedať.
There is still work to do.	Stále je čo robiť.
Now I'm ready to know.	Teraz som pripravený vedieť.
This is not good, not good at all.	To nie je dobré, vôbec nie dobré.

I want to be with you.	Chcem byť s tebou.
That's about it.	To je asi tak všetko.
He doesn't know how.	Nevie ako.

You are my friend.	Si môj priateľ.
It is very difficult for me.	Je to pre mňa veľmi ťažké.

That's what they did.	To je to, čo urobili.

He thought of everything.	Myslel na všetko.
Here are mine.	Tu sú moje.
Unless.	Ak nie.
And that seemed enough.	A to sa zdalo dosť.
I don't have any.	ja žiadne nemám.

Here it is good enough for me.	Tu je to pre mňa dosť dobré.

I know there is a reason behind it all.	Viem, že za tým všetkým je dôvod.
That's where it happened.	Práve tam sa to stalo.
You are still my friend.	Stále si môj priateľ.
He will still be gone.	Stále bude preč.
Where we should be.	Tam, kde máme byť.
And it certainly is.	A to určite je.
We all have time.	Všetci máme čas.
And that's okay.	A to je v poriadku.
But they did and here we are.	Ale urobili to a sme tu.
Maybe she was right.	Možno mala pravdu.
I didn't think it would still be here.	Nemyslel som si, že to tu ešte bude.
He wanted to know everything about us.	Chcel o nás vedieť všetko.
He knows something.	Niečo vie.
I wasn't so sure myself.	Sám som si nebol taký istý.
Maybe it was better that way.	Možno to tak bolo lepšie.
Like in school.	Ako v škole.
Yes, my father would be gone.	Áno, môj otec by bol preč.
It used to not be like that.	Kedysi to tak nebolo.
But that's nothing.	Ale to je nič.
No one is better than this one.	Nikto nie je lepší ako tento.
In one day, everyone could do everything wrong.	V jeden deň mohol každý urobiť všetko zle.
I'm not sure how.	Nie som si istý ako.

I thought everyone.	Myslel som, že každý.
Yes, it looks like that.	Áno, vyzerá to tak.
That is sometimes difficult.	To je niekedy ťažké.
He just waited.	Len čakal.

He really didn't want to have it.	Naozaj to nechcel mať.
It won't be this year.	Tento rok nebude.
But not for very long.	Nie však veľmi dlho.
A lot.	Veľa.
Maybe you already knew that.	Možno ste to už vedeli.

What are you	Čo si .
Tell me all about it.	Povedz mi o tom všetko.
He said it very simply.	Povedal to veľmi jednoducho.
No, no, nothing like that.	Nie, nie, nič také.

We are where we are.	Sme tam, kde sme.
This is certainly true.	Toto je určite pravda.
You can't come here.	Nemôžeš sem prísť.
But that's the day.	To je ale deň.
He didn't want me to leave.	Nechcel, aby som odišiel.
For what he was.	Za to, aký bol.
It's different to have him there every day.	Je iné mať ho tam každý deň.
She said it there.	Tam to povedala.
The problem was that no one knew where he was.	Problém bol v tom, že nikto nevedel, kde je.
He was lucky.	Mal šťastie.
And there were more of them.	A bolo ich viac.
To all of you.	Vám všetkým.
Which may not be what you want.	Čo možno nie je to, čo chcete.

It's hard and you know it.	Je to ťažké a ty to vieš.
We wanted to do it.	Chceli sme to urobiť.
I didn't tell you more.	Viac som ti nepovedal.
One had three.	Jeden mal tri.
It's not difficult at all.	Nie je to vôbec ťažké.
He thinks he has.	Myslí si, že má.
Which is almost certainly the case.	O čo takmer určite ide.
He felt tired all day.	Celý deň sa cítil unavený.
I'm surprised, myself.	Som prekvapený, sám.
That is all.	To je všetko.
I don't want anything from you.	Nič od teba nechcem.
They had plenty of time to get out.	Mali dosť času dostať sa von.
They had a reason for it.	Mali na to dôvod.
He let me go.	Nechal ma ísť.
I could have gone.	Mohol som ísť.
It was still the same movie.	Bol to stále ten istý film.
I'm going there myself.	Sám tam idem.
I should have talked to you about it.	Mal som sa s tebou o tom porozprávať.

I'm having a really bad week.	Mám naozaj zlý týždeň.
Okay, we're fine.	Dobre, máme sa dobre.

Indeed, it is.	Naozaj, je.
It's hard to get into.	Je ťažké sa do toho dostať.
But there is more going on here.	Ale deje sa tu viac.
Decided to.	Rozhodol sa.
You will.	Ty budeš.
But that would be nothing.	Ale to by nebolo nič.
I'm not there yet.	Ešte tam nie som.
I hope he's right.	Dúfam, že má pravdu.
I have to.	Musím .
It's not a happy house.	Nie je to šťastný dom.

But you're human too.	Ale aj ty si človek.
Actually not good at all.	V skutočnosti vôbec nie dobré.
No, not even that.	Nie, ani to nie.
He didn't say no.	Nepovedal nie.

He should have been there.	Mal tam byť.
I did it anyway.	Aj tak som to urobil.
You could have done it at home.	Mohol si to urobiť doma.
Maybe that's true.	Možno je to pravda.
He does it for me too.	Robí to aj pre mňa.

All day at home.	Celý deň doma.
They are things.	Sú to veci.
It could be a year.	Môže to byť rok.

I need it now more than you know.	Teraz to potrebujem viac, ako vieš.

He couldn't quite help it.	Nemohol si celkom pomôcť.
Yes, everyone knows that.	Áno, každý to vie.
She told me you were back.	Povedala mi, že si tu späť.
It's not that we want to have everything right.	Nie je to tak, že by sme chceli mať všetko v poriadku.
I'm not supposed to do that.	Nemám to robiť.
My whole life.	Celý môj život.
One more, she told herself.	Ešte jeden, povedala si.
That he liked me.	Že ma mal rád.

No one could get him there.	Nikto ho tam nemohol dostať.

It's not good for him either.	Nie je to dobré ani pre neho.
That was all they could afford.	To bolo všetko, čo si mohli dovoliť.
You can talk about it.	Môžete sa o tom porozprávať.
But it was his idea to find you.	Bol to však jeho nápad nájsť ťa.

It's never too late.	Nikdy nie je neskoro.
Or he didn't want to.	Alebo nechcel.

As life does.	Ako to život robí.
You'd have to be good to do that.	Aby si to dokázal, musel by si byť dobrý.

I wanted to find a reason to stay.	Chcel som nájsť dôvod zostať.
He had a good reason.	Mal dobrý dôvod.
