I didn’t want to be here myself.	Özüm bu ýerde bolmak islemedim.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It didn't take long for him to decide.	Karar bermek üçin oňa köp wagt gerek däldi.
In fact, he is not a very good guy.	Hakykatdanam, ol gaty gowy ýigit däl.
It would be nice to see the truth.	Hakykaty görmek gowy bolardy.
Such a thing is impossible.	Munuň ýaly zat mümkin däl.
They will not be there.	Olar ol ýerde bolmaz.
Fast food fast.	Çalt nahar çalt.

Something for next year, maybe.	Geljek ýyl üçin bir zat, belki.

This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
He could still do it.	Ol henizem edip bilýärdi.

Something else will happen this time.	Bu gezek başga zat bolar.
Of course, he never thought of such a serious thing.	Elbetde, munuň ýaly çynlakaý zat hakda pikir etmedi.
This will definitely make things better.	Bu, elbetde, zatlary gowy eder.

I could not give	Men berip bilmedim
He could not sleep.	Ol uklap bilmedi.

An idea came to him.	Oňa bir pikir geldi.
This is my first.	Bu meniň ilkinji.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
Maybe even a month.	Belki hatda bir aý.
He couldn't even get a single sound.	Ol hatda ýekeje ses hem alyp bilmedi.
Nothing is good or bad.	Hiç zat gowy ýa-da erbet däl.
I will make you happy	Men seni bagtly ederin.
He was a little crazy.	Biraz däli boldy.

He wanted to be both.	Ikisi bolmak isledi.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
Maybe a few hours.	Belki birnäçe sagat.
That sounds great.	Bu gaty gowy ýaly.
I will.	Etjek.
He said he didn't want to see you.	Ol seni görmek islemedi diýdi.
That should help a lot.	Bu köp kömek etmeli.
This is the only way for them.	Bu olar üçin ýeke-täk ýol.
It just wasn’t that interesting to me.	Diňe meniň üçin beýle gyzykly däldi.
Not good either.	Şeýle hem gowy däl.
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
Happy.	Bagtly.
You have to do better.	Has gowy etmeli.

It takes time.	Wagt gerek.
In fact, we are not.	Aslynda biz ýok.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle etmedi.
I think that's it.	Bu meniň pikirimçe.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu ýerde şeýle.
This was never true.	Bu hiç wagt dogry däldi.
And that's not true.	We beýle dogry däl.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat iş ýaly däldi.
I believe.	Men ynanýaryn.
He didn't tell me.	Ol maňa aýtmady.
What a question.	Näme sorag.
I had.	Mende bardy.
This is not surprising.	Bu gaty geň däl.

This makes it easier.	Bu has aňsat bolýar.
In addition.	Mundan başga.
I hope it was interesting.	Bu gyzykly boldy diýip umyt edýärin.
I can't give you anything	Men saňa hiç zat berip bilemok

He did not know he existed.	Ol özüniň bardygyny bilmeýärdi.
Not just me.	Diňe meniň bilen däl.
They really did exist.	Olar hakykatdanam bardy.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
Now the question is, how?	Indi sorag, nädip?
This is difficult for me.	Bu, meniň üçin kyn.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
I want to be that guy one day.	Bir gün şol ýigit bolmak isleýärin.
Three times three.	Üç gezek iki.
This is great for me.	Bu meniň üçin ajaýyp.
Tell me something new.	Maňa täze bir zat aýdyň.
He thought well.	Ol gowy pikir etdi.
I doubt it, but it is possible.	Muňa şübhelenýärin, ýöne mümkin.
You are very good	Sen gaty gowy
He was not going to do it.	Ol muny etjek däldi.
Everything seems to be going well.	Hemme zat gowy ýaly bolup görünýär.
He gave it to me.	Ol muny maňa berdi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ol ýerde ýalňyşlyk ýok.
So here we are.	Şonuň üçin biz şu ýerde.
It was fun at the time.	Şol wagt hezil boldy.
There was a loud noise.	Gaty ses çykdy.
He didn't care.	Ol bu barada alada etmedi.
He wanted to go to school.	Mekdebe gitmek isledi.
I will do the right thing.	Dogry etjek bolaryn.
He thought he could help.	Kömek edip biljekdigini pikir etdi.
He never thought about it.	Hiç haçan onuň bilen pikir etmedi.
There is one last issue.	Soňky bir mesele bar.
I thought this was right.	Bu dogry diýip pikir etdim.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
This is not a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk däl.
There is another problem for you.	Siziň üçin ýene bir kynçylyk bar.
I bought it for you.	Men muny siziň üçin satyn aldym.
Couldn't be.	Bolup bilmedi.
No one likes to do that.	Hiç kim bu işi etmegi halamaýar.
Another mistake.	Başga bir ýalňyşlyk.
I want to do something more interesting.	Has gyzykly zatlar etmek isleýärin.
We are here.	Biz bu ýerde.
So it will take some time.	Şonuň üçin birneme wagt gerek.
It was never a bad thing for us.	Biziň üçin bu hiç wagt erbet zat däldi.
Because it happened.	Sebäbi ol şeýle boldy.

He did not want to know.	Ol bilmek islemedi.
I haven't seen it before.	Men ozal görmedim.
What happens is that.	Bolýan zatlar nähili bolýar.
It's over.	Bu indi.
I want to marry a girl	Men gyz almak isleýärin
We must not take it anywhere.	Biz hiç ýere 'almaly' däl.

That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň isleýän işi.
There was no one else to see.	Ol ýerde görüp biljek başga hiç kim ýokdy.
They are for that.	Olar munuň üçin.
You are human.	Sen adam.

The answer is.	Jogap iki.
It may even be early.	Hatda ir bolup biler.
You know	Bilýärsiň.
She looks so beautiful.	Ol oňa gaty owadan görünýär.
With us	Biziň bilen.
I think it should be you.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu sen bolmaly.
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
He knows nothing better than that.	Ol mundan gowy zady bilmeýär.
I know when this will happen.	Munuň haçan boljakdygyny bilýärin.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
It could be bad.	Erbet bolup biler.
Quick.	Çalt.
How much.	Näçe.
I never thought about it.	Hiç haçan bu hakda pikir etmedim.
Things to come.	Geljek zatlar.
I don't know what happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilemok.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
He could not promise.	Ol söz berip bilmedi.
So it can't be that bad.	Şonuň üçin beýle erbet bolup bilmez.
This is not really far away.	Bu hakykatdanam uzak däl.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Iş wagty geldi.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
So there is no problem.	Şonuň üçin ol ýerde hiç hili mesele ýok.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
I saw myself.	Men özümi gördüm.
A week, maybe two.	Bir hepde, belki iki bolup biler.
There is no one else, nothing else.	Başga hiç kim ýok, başga hiç zat ýok.
This is a very difficult thing.	Bu gaty kyn zat.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolar.
Nice to meet you again	Seni ýene görmek gowy boldy.
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
The song is great.	Aýdym ajaýyp.
This idea worries me.	Bu pikir meni biynjalyk edýär.
They are many.	Olar köp.
Only the best answer can be found.	Diňe iň gowy jogap bolup biler.
So here we are.	Şonuň üçin biz şu ýerde.
He has no choice.	Oňa mümkinçilik ýok.

Life was fun again.	Durmuş ýene gyzykly boldy.
Something is wrong here.	Bu ýerde bir zat dogry däl.
It may have to be.	Bolmaly bolmagy mümkin.
I think that's me.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu men.
He is not here.	Ol bu ýerde däl.

You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
That must be a mistake!	Bu ýalňyşlyk bolmaly!
Great	Ajaýyp.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat däldi.
This is not easy.	Bu beýle aňsat däl.
Here it is, before and after.	Ine, ine, öň we soň.
Every crazy person is crazy.	Her bir däli adam däli.
It will be better for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin has gowy bolar.
I never saw it.	Men muny asla görmedim.
This is not really my thing.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň zadym däl.
I got you	Men seni aldym
Maybe, maybe.	Belki, belki.
It will only be tonight.	Diňe şu gije bolar.
That should be sufficient enough.	Bu ýeterlik bolmaly.
She's fine tonight.	Ol şu gije gowy.
I thought.	Men pikir etdim.
He did well.	Gowy etdi.
Both words are correct.	Iki söz hem dogry.
Not even close.	Hatda, ýakyn ýaly däl.
It's hard to see.	Muny görmek kyn.
I think that's a bad thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu erbet zat.
That was not the case before.	Ozal beýle däldi.
You know, I never wanted you.	Bilýärsiň, men seni hiç haçan islemedim.
I didn't think of anything else.	Başga zat hakda pikir etmedim.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
He did not answer.	Jogap bermedi.
He didn't know it.	Ol muny bilmeýärdi.
no	ýok.
He was not against it.	Ol muňa garşy däldi.
Of course I don't think so.	Elbetde pikir etmeýärin.
It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
He offers things.	Ol zatlary teklip edýär.
For good reason.	Gowy sebäp bilen.
Everyone.	Her kim.
I offered to help.	Kömek etmegi teklip etdim.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Bir zatlar etmegiň wagty.
He knows what he can do.	Näme edip biljekdigini bilýär.
This is not the case either.	Bu hem däl.
I couldn't be happier.	Has bagtly bolup bilmedim.
A lot has happened.	Köp zatlar boldy.
He didn't do that to me.	Ol maňa beýle etmedi.
He came and went.	Geldi we gitdi.
I couldn't worry about it anymore.	Indi bu barada alada edip bilmedim.
Someone can get it.	Kimdir biri alyp biler.
There is no better time now.	Häzirki wagtda has gowy wagt ýok.
She doesn't need you anymore.	Ol saňa indi gerek däl.
The next one is the next one.	Indiki we indiki.
There is a word for that.	Munuň üçin bir söz bar.
She lives very close to me.	Ol maňa gaty ýakyn ýaşaýar.
I don't mind anymore.	Men indi garşy däl.
Because it's great.	Sebäbi ajaýyp.
And then,	Soň bolsa,
We have to do the right thing.	Biz dogry zatlary etmeli.
He really did.	Hakykatdanam şeýle etdi.
Not beautiful at all.	Asla owadan däl.
That's the way it is now.	Indi şeýle boldy.
Something else is here now.	Bu ýerde indi başga zat.

No no no.	Ýok ýok ýok.
Something different with them.	Olar bilen başga bir zat.
And so it was.	Ol hem şeýle boldy.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe bu barada akylly bolmaly.
It was evening.	Agşam boldy.
He went out at night.	Ol gije çykdy.
This is often the case.	Hakykatdanam köplenç şeýle bolýar.
He could not see.	Ol görüp bilmedi.
I found it easy to leave.	Men gitmegi aňsat gördüm.
This request is not good.	Bu haýyş gowy däl.
We will need it.	Bize gerek bolar.
Too big for me	Meniň üçin gaty uly

You are against me.	Sen maňa garşy.

He thought it was not.	Şol wagt däl diýip pikir etdi.
There is another concern.	Başga bir alada bar.
In fact, it is very difficult.	Aslynda bu gaty kyn.
You really have to do the same.	Aslynda şol bir zady etmeli.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu dogry alada.

That's what happened today.	Ine, şu gün şeýle boldy.
He got it.	Ol aldy.
Nothing is fast enough.	Hiç zat ýeterlik çalt däl.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.

It shouldn't have happened, but it did.	Bolmaly däldi, ýöne şeýle boldy.
He advised.	Ol maslahat berdi.
It was not beautiful.	Bu owadan däldi.

That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şonuň ýaly.
You have to do something about it.	Bu barada bir zat etmeli.

In fact, he had nothing else to do.	Aslynda onuň edip biljek başga zady ýokdy.
There is no such thing now.	Häzir beýle zat ýok.
Always beautiful	Elmydama owadan.
You may have to get another one !.	Başga birini almaly bolmagy mümkin!.
He only knows that.	Muny diňe bilýär.
It happens.	Bu bolýar.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
I'm in the right place.	Men dogry ýerde.
Why not?	Näme üçin beýle däl?

No words.	Söz ýok.

Then it came to me.	Soň maňa geldi.
I'm sure it will.	Boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
It seems very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly ýaly.
It seemed impossible.	Mümkin däl ýalydy.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
There must be a reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi bolmaly.
I heard it myself.	Muny özüm eşitdim.
He wants nothing more.	Ol mundan başga hiç zat islemeýär.
He didn't want to help her.	Oňa kömek etmek islemedi.
How to respond?	Nädip jogap bermeli?
Which is good.	Haýsy gowy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
This is really great for them.	Bu olar üçin hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
It was very difficult to be here.	Bu ýerde bolmak gaty kyn boldy.
They are difficult.	Olar kyn.
Too many people.	Gaty köp adam.
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
That's right.	Dogry.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
Must get.	Almaly.
He really knows what happened.	Ol hakykatdanam näme bolandygyny bilýär.
This is a job, this is a job.	Bu iş, bu bir iş.
He will too.	Ol hem eder.
And then you have to tell him.	Soň bolsa oňa aýtmaly.
We have to do something.	Biz bir zat etmeli.
It's a little closer to home.	Bu öýe biraz ýakyn.
This time there seemed to be no question.	Bu gezek hiç hili sorag ýok ýalydy.
Nowadays everyone does everything.	Häzirki wagtda her kim hemme zady edýär.
This is not the only problem.	Diňe bu mesele däl.
Of course, there was little life there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde durmuş kän däldi.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
This was not the case at all.	Bu düýbünden beýle däldi.
I am nothing	Men hiç zat däl
This is a big deal.	Bu uly mesele.

There is something very interesting about this.	Bu hakda gaty gyzykly zatlar bar.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
There is a reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi bar.
Then he stayed with her for another year.	Soň bolsa ýene bir ýyl onuň bilen galdy.
I had fun.	Men hezil etdim.
This will not be the case for you.	Siziň üçin beýle bolmaz.
He never knew.	Ol hiç wagt bilmeýärdi.
That sounds good.	Bu gowy ýaly.
It has to be bad for that.	Munuň üçin erbet bolmaly.
He hoped it would not happen.	Ol beýle bolmaz diýip umyt etdi.
For a while.	Biraz wagt bäri.
It may or may not be good.	Gowy bolup biler, ýa-da bolmaz.
That sounds really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy ýaly.
He decided to try something else.	Başga bir zady synap görmek kararyna geldi.
I really saw it.	Men ony hakykatdanam gördüm.
Not so today.	Bu gün beýle däl.
She is at home.	Ol öýde.
Then he rested for a week.	Soň bolsa bir hepde dynç aldy.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
You can't help it.	Oňa kömek edip bolmaz.
He said he was happy.	Ol bagtly diýdi.
It seemed a little easy.	Biraz aňsat ýalydy.
I don't think that's a good idea.	Gowy pikir däl öýdemok.
There is something about it, like something close.	Bu hakda bir zat bar, ýakyn bir zat ýaly.
We can do better than that.	Mundan has gowy edip bileris.
Not many answers.	Jogap kän däl.
I'm so weird	Men beýle geň.
No one knew it.	Muny hiç kim bilmeýärdi.
Someone likes it.	Kimdir biri halaýar.
Several times, even.	Birnäçe gezek, hatda.
At that time.	Şol wagt.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
It really came to me.	Bu hakykatdanam maňa geldi.
Me.	Ine.
Of course it is.	Elbetde şeýle.
She is ready.	Ol edil taýyn.
I think anyone can trouble us.	Kim bize kynçylyk berip biler diýip pikir edýärin.
From now on	Mundan beýläk
In fact, much more can be said.	Aslynda has köp zady aýdyp bolar.
There was no food in the house.	Öýde nahar ýokdy.
This did nothing for him.	Bu onuň üçin hiç zat etmedi.
Something bad.	Erbet bir zat.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
He must be as big as I am.	Ol meniň ýaly uly bolsa gerek.
I can only enjoy it.	Men diňe lezzet alyp bilerin.
There is nothing against it.	Oňa garşy hiç zat ýok.
This is really strange.	Bu hakykatdanam geň görünýär.
You're so crazy, aren't you?	Sen gaty däli, şeýlemi?
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
It keeps me busy.	Meni meşgul edýär.
I'm here tomorrow.	Men ertir şu ýerde.
It's not about the sound.	Ses hakda däl.
Oh, right?	Aý, şeýlemi?
I heard a voice.	Bir ses eşitdim.
Everything will be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolar.
There is a reason for hope.	Umyt üçin sebäp bar.
I was stupid.	Men samsyk boldum.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
It seemed like a long time.	Uzak wagt ýalydy.
This may not be enough.	Bu hatda ýeterlik däl bolup biler.
If anyone can help me.	Kimdir biri maňa kömek edip bilýän bolsa.
He replied that it was too late.	Ol gijä galdy diýip jogap berdi.
Of course, this is a mistake.	Elbetde, bu ýalňyşlyk.
That's right- this is not about money.	Dogry, pul söz däl.
What happened	Näme boldy?
Everything will be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolar.
That can't be the case.	Şeýle zat bolup bilmez.
We are.	Biz şeýle.
Because it is.	Sebäbi şeýle.
I don't really care.	Men hakykatdanam alada etmeýärin.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Maybe?	Mümkin?
I can't get it today.	Men ony şu gün alyp bilemok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu biynjalyk pikir.
I think we can do that.	Muny edip bileris öýdýän.
I am here.	Men şu ýerde.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Me and me, me and me.	Men we men, men we men.
This is very true.	Munuň özi gaty dogry.
Like me, I believe.	Men ýaly, ynanýaryn.
He had never done that before.	Ozal beýle zat etmedi.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
They are not necessarily.	Olar hökman däl.
This will happen.	Bu zat bolar.
What year is it now?	Indi haýsy ýyl?
Maybe there is a possibility.	Belki bir mümkinçilik bar.
She was not beautiful.	Ol owadan däldi.
Maybe he'll come back to it.	Belki, oňa gaýdyp geler.
Everything was very fast.	Hemme zat gaty çalt boldy.
This man.	Bu adam.
Just about the girl.	Diňe gyz hakda.
So young.	Şonuň üçin ýaş.
We are not bad.	Biz erbet däl.
You can tell me.	Maňa aýdyp bilersiňiz.
There has to be a better way.	Has gowy ýol bolmaly.
Really weird.	Hakykatdanam geň.
I didn't even see it.	Men hatda görmedim.
I have no money	Mende pul ýok
I know.	Men bilýärin.
Oh, there's a problem here.	Aý, bu ýerde bir mesele bar.
He knows this is not the case.	Ol munuň ýokdugyny bilýär.
I don't trust you	Men saňa ynanamok
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däl.
This did not bother him.	Bu ony biynjalyk etmedi.
Police were everywhere.	Polisiýa hemme ýerde bardy.
A prisoner.	Bir tussag.
Oh, one more thing.	Aý, ýene bir zat.
She had to pay attention.	Oňa üns bermeli boldy.
I don’t know how that could be possible.	Munuň nädip mümkin bolup biljekdigini bilemok.
It's very easy to do that.	Muny etmek gaty aňsat.
Maybe he can say that too.	Mümkin, muny hem aýdyp biler.
What a bad thing!	Bu nähili erbet zat!
It could be worse.	Has erbet bolup biler.
I'm fine with that.	Men muňa gowy.
He took everything from me.	Ol hemme zady menden aldy.
Which, of course, we did.	Haýsy, biz.
Almost no one was ready for it.	Munuň üçin hiç kim diýen ýaly taýyn däldi.
I can’t really be with him and do a lot of things.	Men hakykatdanam onuň bilen bolup, köp zatlary edip bilemok.
I never believe that.	Men muňa hiç haçan ynanamok.
In fact, it is not possible.	Aslynda bu mümkin däl.
It wasn't long.	Uzak däldi.
That could be the case.	Şeýle bolup biler.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I want to get this.	Men muny almak isleýärin.
This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
He thought it was a good thing.	Gowy bir zat diýip pikir etdi.
Because he hadn't been there for a long time.	Sebäbi ol beýle uzak wagt bäri ýokdy.
And then another.	Soň bolsa başga.
I am alone now.	Men indi ýeke özüm.
Ma'am.	Bu.
She began to fall asleep.	Ol uklap başlady.
Never enough.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik däl.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolmaz.
I don't think many people know.	Köp adam bilmeýär öýdemok.
It's just interesting to me.	Bu diňe meniň üçin gyzykly.
You can do the same.	Muny hem edip bilersiňiz.
It was fun.	Bu hezil boldy.
There is a lot of work to be done here.	Bu ýerde iş köp.
We need a few things.	Bize birnäçe zat gerek.
This guy is just having fun !.	Bu ýigit diňe hezil edýär!.
Of course this is possible.	Elbetde bu mümkin.
It should be.	Bolmaly.
That's right.	Dogry.
I didn't care.	Men muňa alada etmedim.
I don't know about that.	Men beýle zady bilemok.
Take it.	Bu ol.
I am not.	Men beýle däl.
They really did exist.	Olar hakykatdanam bardy.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu dogry.
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele.
Three months.	Üç aý.
There is a job.	Bir iş bar.
About money.	Pul hakda.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
The former is difficult.	Öňküsi kyn.
Often bad advice.	Köplenç erbet maslahat.
It won't be good.	Gowy bolmaz.
All night, really.	Bütin gije, hakykatdanam.
This is true.	Bu söz dogry.
The question is what to do next.	Indiki näme etmeli diýen sorag.
And then he got it.	Soň bolsa ony aldy.
He didn't have to go far.	Uzak gitmeli däldi.
It doesn't do anything for you.	Bu siziň üçin hiç zat etmeýär.
He is two people.	Ol iki adam.
And that's great.	Bu hem ajaýyp zat.
I did.	Men etdim.
He no longer wanted to be there.	Indi ol ýerde bolmak islemedi.
He thought you needed it.	Ol saňa gerek, diýip pikir etdi.
We need it.	Bu bize gerek.
It will take months.	Birnäçe aý gerek bolar.
Today, not tomorrow.	Bu gün, ertir däl.
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
I think it's good.	Gowy öýdýän.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
I don't do that.	Men muny etmeýärin.
I had no hope.	Maňa umyt ýokdy.
I don't need it this morning.	Maňa şu gün irden gerek däl.
It’s about doing something else.	Bu başga bir zat etmek hakda.
There was only one reason for this.	Munuň ýeke-täk sebäbi bardy.
This is about me.	Bu men hakda.
It happens.	Bu bolýar.
That's a lot for me.	Bu meniň üçin köp zat.
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
I really think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, hakykatdanam şeýle.
It wasn't bad.	Erbet däldi.
It's good to go.	Gitmek gowy.
I actually saw a lot.	Aslynda gaty köp gördüm.
That would be nice.	Bu gowy bolar.
He says he has to.	Etmelidigini aýdýar.
He said this quickly.	Ol muny çalt aýtdy.
That's all you have to do.	Bu seniň etmeli zadyň.
He told me once.	Ol maňa bir gezek aýtdy.
It will be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolar.
He immediately went to work.	Ol derrew işe gitdi.
I think it's time.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu wagt geldi.
It's very close.	Bu gaty ýakyn.
Of course it will.	Elbetde geler.
This is not the case.	Bu däl.
They are not many.	Olar kän däl.
Not so today.	Bu gün beýle däl.
He knew it, and he didn't do much.	Ol muny bilýärdi we kän bir zat etmedi.
He comes here.	Ol şu ýere gelýär.
You are the only one	Sen ýeke-täk
I didn't have enough time.	Mende ýeterlik wagt ýokdy.
I told the truth.	Men hakykaty aýtdym.
Something was wrong.	Bir zat dogry däldi.
You have to do something.	Bir zat etmeli.
Now there was more.	Indi has köp zat bardy.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, ýok.
I don't think he will be older than me.	Ol menden uly bolar öýdemok.
opposed him.	oňa garşy çykdy.
It's always interesting.	Bu elmydama gyzykly.
No need, because he says it all today.	Gerek däl, sebäbi şu gün hemmesini aýdýar.
And then it happens.	Soň bolsa şeýle bolýar.
Okay.	Bolýar.
One is new.	Biri täze.
He knew it was there.	Ol munuň bardygyny bilýärdi.
This was the first for me.	Bu meniň üçin ilkinji boldy.
One is not very good.	Biri gaty gowy däl.
You can see it today.	Şu gün görüp bilersiňiz.
He is no longer with us.	Ol indi biziň bilen däl.
Everyone wants an answer.	Her kim jogap isleýär.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Indi wagt boldy.

Something that is possible.	Mümkin bolup biljek zat.
What to do now?	Indi näme etmeli?
Everyone knows everything.	Hemmeler hemme zady bilýär.

This is a very serious matter.	Bu gaty çynlakaý mesele.
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
It was not very beautiful.	Bu gaty bir owadan däldi.

There was something else about him.	Ol hakda başga bir zat hem bardy.
She is OK now.	Häzir ol gowy.
It's too late.	Gijä gitdi.

Maybe too much.	Belki gaty köp.
I don't know anything	Men hiç zady bilemok
Then came the call.	Soň bolsa jaň geldi.
He will return home next week.	Geljek hepde öýüne gaýdyp geler.
Not many people think so.	Köp adam hakda beýle pikir etmeýär.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
I doubt this will happen.	Munuň boljakdygyna şübhelenýärin.
He knew it was there.	Ol munuň bardygyny bilýärdi.
This is indeed the case.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle.
I didn't do that.	Men muny etmedim.
They are really great.	Olar hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
Can you suggest something else?	Başga bir zat teklip edip bilersiňizmi?
He knows nothing about it.	Ol hiç zat hakda hiç zat bilmeýär.
Nothing to worry about.	Alada etjek zat ýok.
There was no way out.	Bu ýerde hiç hili ýol ýokdy.

It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
This is something new.	Bu täze bir zat.
We are not there yet.	Biz entek ol ýerde ýok.
A lot of people do that.	Köp adam muny edýär.
Not a month, but a month.	Aý däl, bir aý.
He knew it would be difficult to do that.	Muny etmegiň özüne kyn boljakdygyny bilýärdi.
I had to do it for two weeks.	Iki hepde etmeli boldy.
I need help with this.	Munuň üçin kömek gerek.
He knew that something was wrong with me.	Ol meniň bilen bir zadyň dogry däldigini bilýärdi.
They were really hard.	Olar hakykatdanam kyn boldy.
It was like that.	Bu hem ýalydy.
No one wanted to talk to him.	Onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýän adam ýokdy.
I thought we could never be together.	Hiç haçan bile bolup bilmeris öýdüpdim.
You know that.	Muny bilersiňiz.
Of course, this was not good.	Elbetde, bu gowy däldi.
I can't tell you right now.	Men saňa häzir aýdyp biljek däl.
I'll call you tomorrow.	Ertir saňa jaň ederin.
I think he knows something.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol bir zady bilýär.
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
It's very difficult to do.	Ony etmek gaty kyn zat.
This is really difficult.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn.
I did the same thing again.	Men ýene şol zady etdim.
He never thought of it that way.	Ol muny asla pikir etmedi.
He just wants to talk.	Ol diňe gürleşmek isleýär.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
You have to be prepared for that.	Munuň üçin hem taýyn bolmaly.
I've only been here.	Men diňe şu ýerde boldum.
It's early, so there's still time.	Ir, şonuň üçin entek wagt bar.
You have to stop doing that.	Muny etmegi bes etmeli.
He is crazy and no longer knows himself.	Ol däli we özüni indi bilmeýär.
Something happened to that girl.	Şol gyz bilen bir zat boldy.
He did it and it's great.	Muny etdi we gaty gowy.
He decided to say it.	Ol muny aýtmak kararyna geldi.
Something bad will happen.	Erbet bir zat bolar.

There is no help for that.	Munuň üçin kömek ýok.
It was early in the morning.	Bu ir bilen boldy.
I haven't seen it before.	Men ozal görmedim.
These things are just fun.	Bu zatlar diňe gyzykly.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
This is really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly.
Strange, but very good.	Geň, ýöne gaty gowy.
He still lives there.	Ol henizem şol ýerde ýaşaýar.
He doesn't seem right.	Ol maňa dogry däl ýaly.
Now he had two.	Indi onuň ikisi bardy.
I'm scared.	Men gorkýaryn.
What you need, what you need.	Size gerek zat, size gerek zat.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda muny etmek dogry.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
The question is, is that really the case?	Sorag, hakykatdanam şeýlemi?

I'm better now.	Men häzir has gowy.
No one but me.	Menden başga hiç kim däl.
She was not beautiful at all.	Ol asla owadan däldi.

That's it.	Ine, şeýle.
What an interesting book!	Nähili gyzykly kitap!
He thought he would.	Etjekdigini pikir etdi.

No one wants to be that guy.	Hiç kim ol ýigit bolmak islemeýär.
Good year	Gowy ýyl.
He did not know about it.	Ol bu barada bilmeýärdi.
Everything was and is here.	Bu ýerde hemme zat bardy we bar.

Now it's easier to do.	Indi etmek has aňsat.

There is nothing beautiful here.	Bu ýerde owadan zat ýok.
He never thought.	Ol hiç wagt pikir etmedi.
This is something else.	Bu başga zat.

I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
We can try it now.	Häzir synap bileris.
I can't go there now.	Men häzir ol ýere baryp bilemok.

I want to talk to you.	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.

And then he cares.	Soň bolsa ony alada edýär.
Of course, this is how it looks.	Elbetde, şeýle görünýär.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilenok.

Excuse me, can you help me?	Bagyşlaň, maňa kömek edip bilersiňizmi?
Because that's not true.	Sebäbi bu dogry däl.

It was great.	Bu uly boldy.
He knew what he was doing.	Ol näme edenini bilýärdi.
He didn't want to be anywhere else.	Başga bir ýerde bolmak islemedi.
The problem was, he couldn't tell.	Mesele, aýdyp bilmedi.
We can see this with them here.	Muny olar bilen şu ýerde görüp bileris.
Of course it is.	Elbetde şeýle.
There was so much he didn't know.	Onuň bilmeýän köp zady bardy.

Of course, he didn't think so.	Elbetde, ol muny pikir etmedi.

This makes me very anxious.	Bu meni gaty biynjalyk edýär.
It will be difficult now.	Indi kyn bolar.
I didn’t find it very difficult to get a book.	Kitap almak gaty kyn görmedim.
He didn't need anything.	Oňa bir zat gerek däldi.
Why do this?	Näme üçin beýle etmeli?
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.

I need life.	Maňa durmuş gerek.
In fact, many people do not agree.	Aslynda köp adam muňa razy däl.

This is good for them.	Bu olar üçin gowy.
I got it.	Men aldym.

He is not here.	Ol bu ýerde däl.
Of course.	Elbetde.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
He knew nothing about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat bilmeýärdi.
I don't know much about it.	Men bu hakda kän bilemok.

This is a complete lie.	Bu düýbünden ýalan.
I told her about you.	Men oňa sen hakda aýtdym.
This is a good day for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy gün.
Not now.	Şu wagt däl.
I don't think so.	Beýle pikir eder öýdemok.

He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
It should be enough to vote.	Ses bermek üçin ýeterlik bolmaly.
This is for you.	Bu siziň özüňiz üçin.
I will not have those things.	Men ol zatlar bolmaz.
Something about him worried him.	Ol hakda bir zat ony biynjalyk etdi.
It's not easy to relax.	Dynç almak aňsat däl.
He is not here.	Ol bu ýerde däl.
You have to decide today.	Şu gün karar bermeli.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
I was never like that before.	Men ozal beýle däldim.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
I really thought about it.	Men hakykatdanam bu hakda pikir etdim.
Great job.	Ajaýyp iş.
Whatever you want	Islän zady.

This is also a very good thing.	Bu hem gaty gowy zat.
Now the problem is this.	Indi mesele şu boldy.
That says a lot.	Bu köp zady aýdýar.
There is no way to do that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili ýol ýok.
This is different.	Bu başga.
Of course, there was no question.	Elbetde, sorag ýokdy.
I can't say enough good things about them.	Men olar hakda ýeterlik gowy zatlar aýdyp biljek däl.
I know a lot.	Men köp zady bilýärin.
This is not the only thing.	Bu ýöne bir zat däl.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
This is another matter.	Bu başga bir mesele.

He was right.	Ol dogry aýtdy.
That's it.	Ine, şol ýerde.

Okay.	Bolýar.
It was good to see him.	Ony görmek gowy boldy.
That's more.	Bu has köp.
So much now.	Indi gaty köp.
A few years, maybe more.	Birnäçe ýyl, belki has köp.
This is worse.	Bu has erbet.
He couldn't do it anymore.	Ol indi edip bilmedi.
He said no one was at home.	Öýde hiç kimiň ýokdugyny aýtdy.
He tells me every day.	Ol maňa her gün aýdýar.
No one can call.	Hiç kim jaň edip bilenok.
These are two completely different things.	Bu düýbünden başga iki iş.
This was not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däldi.
Of course, that will be the reason.	Elbetde, munuň sebäbi bolar.
I can't get it	Men alyp bilemok

I will do what is right to do right.	Dogry etmek üçin zerur zatlary ederin.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
I'm sure he can.	Edip biljekdigine ynanýaryn.
Of course I am.	Elbetde, men bar.
This is not just an idea.	Bu diňe bir pikir däl.
That's right, someone else.	Dogry, başga biri.
This book seemed like a great idea.	Bu kitap şeýle ajaýyp pikir ýalydy.
I'll be there.	Men şol ýerde bolaryn.
He was right about that.	Ol bu barada dogry aýtdy.
That's a lot for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty köp.
They were no more.	Olar indi ýokdy.
I think maybe.	Mümkin diýip pikir edýärin.
This is for me.	Bu meniň üçin.
You know, he did it.	Bilýärsiň, ol muny etdi.
I couldn't even see.	Men hatda görüp bilmedim.
It will be here.	Bu ýerde bolar.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
And that’s good, good.	Şeýle hem, bu gowy, gowy.
He was right about that.	Ol bu barada dogry aýtdy.
No one there can harm you.	Ol ýerde hiç kim size zyýan berip bilmez.
Now you are the one who will help me.	Indi sen maňa kömek etjek sen.
A long time ago.	Köp wagt mundan ozal.
This is not very good.	Bu gaty gowy däl.
I'm sure he'll do well.	Onuň gowy etjekdigine ynanýaryn.
Everything will be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolar.
How old are you 	Näçe ýyl?
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
He often does this.	Ol muny köplenç edýär.
It might be better for the book.	Kitap üçin has gowy bolmagy mümkin.
Okay.	Bolýar.
You are beautiful	Sen ajaýyp.
I had no such thing.	Mende beýle zat ýokdy.
He had work to do.	Onuň etmeli işi bardy.
This is not very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly däl.
This may be an interesting question.	Bu gyzykly sorag bolup biler.
I had to.	Men etmeli boldum.
I am not myself right now.	Men şu wagt özüm däl.
It's never enough.	Hiç haçan munuň üçin ýeterlik däl.
Bad, very bad.	Erbet, gaty erbet.
Now he knew he wanted more.	Indi has köp zat isleýändigini bilýärdi.
No one helped him.	Hiç kim oňa kömek etmedi.
Just like before.	Edil öňküsi ýaly.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Gaty köp ýol bar.
He said too much.	Gaty köp diýdi.
Another time.	Başga wagt.
Why do this?	Näme üçin muny etmeli?
I could do nothing	Men hiç zat edip bilmedim
I could not get there.	Men ol ýere baryp bilmedim.
I thought there was something.	Bir zat bar öýdüpdim.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
He needs this message as much as ever.	Oňa bu habar öňküsi ýaly zerur.
Someone came out yesterday.	Biri düýn çykdy.
I couldn't get it	Men alyp bilmedim
Life is too much nowadays.	Häzirki wagtda durmuş gaty köp.
Short and concise.	Gysga we gysga.
For a while	Biraz wagt.
He came.	Ol geldi.
It was already there.	Öňem bardy.
Then there was one.	Soň bolsa biri bardy.
This is the answer.	Bu jogap.
No one can do that right now.	Şu wagt hiç kim edip bilmez.
Is he still there?	Ol henizem barmy?
Oh, what a job!	Aý, bu nähili iş!
Just for you	Diňe seniň üçin.
I often do.	Men köplenç edýärin.
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
We are somewhere now.	Biz häzir bir ýerde.
Big and hard.	Uly we kyn.
It didn't really help.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek etmedi.
I don't really know much about him.	Men ol hakda hakykatdanam kän bilemok.
That's enough for me.	Bu meniň üçin ýeterlik.
I'm sorry, I can't	Bagyşlaň, edip bilemok
There is no such thing.	Şeýle mümkinçilik ýok.
He is stupid.	Ol samsyk.
For this	Munuň üçin
There are two people here.	Bu ýerde iki adam bar.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
The first day.	Ilkinji gün.
We are not so far away today.	Häzirki wagtda biz beýle uzak däl.
He must have done a lot to do that.	Muny etmek üçin köp iş eden bolmaly.
This is working time.	Bu iş wagty.
It doesn't even seem to be there.	Hatda ol ýerde ýok ýaly.
This is not true at all.	Bu asla dogry däl.
Man, it looks great.	Adam, gaty gowy görünýär.
Not for the money.	Pul üçin däl.
I want to have a rest this year.	Bu ýyl dynç almak isleýärin.
There is a better way.	Has gowy ýol bar.
I didn't want that.	Men muny islemedim.
He must have known.	Ol bilýän bolmaly.
He cared for us.	Ol bize alada etdi.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
I didn't know anything.	Men hiç zady bilmeýärdim.
Help me	Maňa kömek et
He said good.	Gowy diýdi.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
I think that's necessary too.	Bu hem zerur diýip pikir edýärin.
I'm so scared.	Men gaty gorkýaryn.
Not every idea is a good idea.	Her pikir gowy pikir däl.
He did not know if there was a call or something.	Ol jaň etmegiň ýa-da başga bir zadyň bardygyny bilmedi.
I did nothing wrong.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedim.
Of course.	Elbetde.
This is good, but not very good.	Bu gowy, ýöne gaty gowy däl.
He told me that.	Ol maňa muny aýtdy.
Doing something for you.	Siziň üçin bir iş etmek.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gyzykly iş.
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
I saw one.	Men birini gördüm.
He told me later.	Ol maňa soň aýtdy.
Oh, very good question.	Aý, gaty gowy sorag.
Of course, you don't have to answer that.	Elbetde, oňa jogap bermek hökman däl.
What's so weird about that ???	Bu ýerde geň zat näme ???.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu beýle däl ýaly.
Must be beautiful.	Owadan bolmaly.
A young girl.	Bir ýaş gyz.
He gave it to me.	Ol meni berdi.
What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Nähili ajaýyp, aýdyp bilersiňiz.
He sounded like one.	Ol edil biri ýaly ses berdi.
I didn't know how to do it.	Men muny nädip etmelidigini bilmedim.
Not you	Sen däl.
This time it's harder.	Bu gezek has kyn.
He just doesn't know anything.	Ol diňe bir zady bilmeýär.
Of course, he was not ready to go.	Elbetde, ol gitmäge taýyn däldi.
Good for me.	Meniň üçin gowy.
Of course, that was not the case now.	Elbetde, häzir beýle däldi.
There are three possible reasons for this.	Munuň üç sebäbi bolup biler.
Not much anymore.	Indi kän däl.
She is very, very smart.	Ol gaty, akylly.
I have	Mende bar.
He told her the truth.	Ol oňa hakykaty aýtdy.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
Another sound came out.	Başga bir ses çykdy.
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat däl zat.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
This is not an impossible problem.	Bu mümkin däl mesele däl.
I can't do everything today or this week.	Şu gün ýa-da şu hepde hemme zady edip bilemok.
Now it is the same.	Indi ol hem şeýle boldy.
Not good	Gowy däl
Of course, what happens here.	Elbetde, bu ýerde näme bolýar.
Man cannot be what he wants to be.	Adam islän zady bolup bilmez.
That was not a lie.	Bu ýalan däldi.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
This is the only time.	Bu ýekeje gezek.
He did not want to tell anyone.	Ol hiç kime aýtmak islemedi.
Three hours ago.	Üç sagat öň.
Maybe once or twice, then it will be fine.	Belki bir ýa-da iki gezek, soň gowy bolar.
It's not like me.	Bu meniň ýaly däl.
It was hard to get to work.	Işe gitmek kyn boldy.
He couldn't figure out why he wanted to talk to them.	Näme üçin olar bilen gürleşmek isleýändigini pikir edip bilmedi.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
This is the only way.	Bu ýeke-täk ýol.
Only you have to be.	Diňe sen bolmaly.
I can't get it	Men ony alyp bilemok
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
This is a big deal.	Bu uly iş.
It's been the last few days.	Soňky birnäçe gün boldy.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
He can't get it.	Ol alyp bilmeýär.
Maybe we.	Belki biz.
It seems to be a problem.	Mesele bolmaly ýaly.
I don’t know how to do that.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilemok.
He replied.	Muňa jogap edip aýtdy.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Only you are there.	Diňe sen bar.
Neither we nor them.	Biz ýa-da olar däl.
That sounds very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly ýaly.
It takes a lot of work to get it right.	Dogry etmek üçin köp iş gerek.
I must have seen it.	Men muny hökman gördüm.
I can help.	Men kömek edip bilerin.
You are better than me	Sen menden has gowy.
I didn't think much.	Men kän pikir etmedim.
It's just weird.	Bu diňe geň.
There was only one person who could.	Bolup biljek ýekeje adam bardy.
We can have a short rest.	Gysga dynç alyp bileris.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
A month and no more.	Bir aý we indi ýok.
It would be nice if it was, but not so.	Bolsa gowy bolardy, ýöne beýle däl.
Now he just couldn't go.	Indi ol diňe gidip bilmedi.
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
One person answered.	Bir adam jogap berdi.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
It's easy!	Bu aňsat!
They will be new.	Olar täze bolar.
He is coming too.	Ol hem gelýär.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
Of course you have to go.	Elbetde gitmeli.
Maybe it will never happen.	Belki, ol asla bolmaz.
Everything is nothing.	Hemme zat hiç zat däl.
He has decided for you and me.	Ol seniň we meniň üçin karar berdi.
There was really nothing to do at home.	Öýde hakykatdanam etmeli zat ýokdy.
In fact many times.	Aslynda köp gezek.
That would be enough.	Bu ýeterlik bolar.
It was like this all summer.	Bütin tomus şeýle boldy.
Because they seem to know more than I do.	Sebäbi olar menden has köp zady bilýän ýaly.
It was great.	Bu ajaýyp boldy.
He talked about me.	Ol meniň hakda aýtdy.
There will be more.	Diňe has köp zat bolar.
He was never close to leaving.	Ol hiç haçan gitmäge ýakyn däldi.
Anyone can say that.	Her kim muny aýdyp biler.
There was no problem.	Mesele ýokdy.
She likes it with everyone.	Ol hemmeler bilen halaýar.
She looked pretty.	Ol ýeterlik owadan ýalydy.
Too big for just the two of us.	Diňe ikimiz üçin gaty uly.
He can do things like that.	Munuň ýaly zatlary edip biler.
To the party.	Oturylyşyga.
I want to talk about something else.	Başga bir zat hakda gürleşmek isleýärin.
This is for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin.
You need it now, you need it fast.	Size indi gerek, çalt gerek.
It was not difficult to help him.	Oňa kömek etmek kyn däldi.
You have to take it and leave quickly.	Ony alyp, çalt gitmeli.
That should not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däldi.
I can do better than you.	Men senden has gowy edip bilerin.
He says a lot.	Köp zat aýdýar.
For help.	Kömek üçin.
He did not do so.	Edil beýle etmedi.
No one paid much attention.	Hiç kim kän bir üns bermedi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu iň gowy zat.
No problem, just a few questions.	Mesele ýok, diňe birnäçe sorag.
Only there.	Diňe şol ýerde.
No one wants to do that.	Hiç kim muny etmek islemeýär.
That's another word.	Bu başga bir söz.
Someone else decided that.	Muny başga biri karar berdi.
This is not difficult.	Bu kyn däl.
Good.	Gowy.
There is everything here.	Bu ýerde bar zat bar.
About many things.	Köp zatlar hakda.
He had not yet spoken to police.	Ol entek polisiýa hiç zat aýtmady.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
There are two reasons.	Iki sebäp bar.
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
He was there alone.	Ol ýerde, ýeke özi bardy.
Necessary.	Zerur.
Why is that?	Näme üçin beýle bolýar?
Someone has to do it.	Kimdir biri etmeli.
He did a good job for that.	Ol munuň üçin gowy iş etdi.
This.	Iki.
It was not possible.	Mümkin däldi.
He just can't do it.	Ol diňe edip bilmeýär.
It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
It is almost impossible to answer.	Hakykatdanam jogap bermek mümkin däl diýen ýaly.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu wagt şeýle.
This idea is not new.	Bu pikir täze däl.
You need more.	Size has köp zat gerek.
I'm questioning everything now.	Men häzir hemme zady sorag edýärin.
It must be difficult.	Kyn bolmaly.
He really is.	Ol hakykatdanam.
It's just crazy.	Bu diňe däli.
Today is not far.	Bu gün uzak däl.
I think he is the only one.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ýeke-täk.
This is the reality of life.	Bu durmuş hakykaty.
I can't.	Men edip bilemok.
He does now.	Indi edýär.
I wasn’t home much that summer.	Şol tomus öýde kän däldim.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ol bir owadan gyz.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
Everyone is the best.	Her kim bu iň gowy adam.
'It's over.'	', boldy'.
I'll call the police.	Men polisiýa jaň ederin.
This could be a big mistake.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk bolup biler.
Only a few.	Diňe birnäçe.
I'll call you tomorrow morning.	Ertir irden jaň ederin.
He was no longer such a person.	Ol indi beýle adam däldi.
A really good book.	Hakykatdanam gowy kitap.
He did not want to think about it.	Ol bu barada pikir etmek islemedi.
He can return now.	Ol häzir gaýdyp biler.
It was as if he wanted to tell us something.	Ol bize bir zat aýtmak isleýän ýalydy.
There is nothing you can do now.	Indi edip biljek zady ýok.
Great	Ajaýyp.
I couldn't get it	Men ony alyp bilmedim
Not good at all.	Elbetde gowy däl.
It really did exist.	Hakykatdanam bardy.
The smart money went elsewhere.	Akylly pul başga ýere gitdi.
It was not easy.	Iş aňsat däldi.
Someone must be an adult.	Kimdir biri uly adam bolmaly.
Maybe a good idea.	Belki gowy pikir.
There was a beautiful man there.	Ol ýerde bir owadan adam bardy.
They are bad.	Olar erbet.
Borrowing often seems easy.	Karz almak köplenç aňsat görünýär.
This is not the case.	Bu, şeýle däl.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
I was there and I did.	Men ol ýerde boldum we etdim.
Also.	Şeýle hem.
This meat is very difficult.	Bu et gaty kyn.
He couldn't do anything else.	Başga zat edip bilmedi.
OK, no.	Bolýar, ýok.
They are.	Olar şeýle.
"You can be right," he said.	Ol: "Dogry aýdyp bilersiňiz" -diýdi.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Belki, belki, belki.
Another reason.	Başga bir sebäp.
I need help.	Maňa kömek gerek.
It's summer there.	Ol ýerde tomus.
I got a lot of help.	Men köp kömek aldym.
I hope so.	Men şeýle eder diýip umyt edýärin.
That's so bad.	Ine, şeýle erbet.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
Has this ever been a good thing?	Bu hiç haçan gowy zat etmedi?
I can go back to school.	Men mekdebe gaýdyp bilerin.
This is true for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin dogry.
Of course not.	Elbetde, bu ýerde beýle däl.
Isn't that weird? 	Bu geň, şeýlemi?
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şonuň ýaly.
Now it will be better in the near future.	Indi ýakyn wagtda has gowy bolar.
I didn't want to do that.	Men muny etmek islemedim.
He was not there.	Ol ol ýerde ýokdy.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
We are still here.	Biz henizem şu ýerde.
In fact many times.	Aslynda köp gezek.
I'm ready now.	Men häzir taýyn boldum.
Great for us.	Biziň üçin ajaýyp.
Of course, this is not an easy task.	Elbetde, bu aňsat iş däl.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
Definitely happy.	Elbetde bagtly.
Whatever you want	Islän zady.
If it was difficult, he could not say.	Bu kyn bolsa, aýdyp bilmedi.
I was alone.	Men ýeke boldum.
Nothing good.	Gowy zat ýok.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
There are many things.	Köp zatlar bar.
What a good idea.	Nähili gowy pikir.
I can't do it right now	Edil şu wagt edip bilemok
That's it.	Munuň özi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, şol bir adam.
In fact, it could be easier.	Aslynda bu has aňsat bolup biler.
I loved this job.	Bu işi gaty gowy gördüm.
This has only happened once.	Bu diňe bir gezek boldy.
I thought you were someone else.	Men seni başga biri diýip pikir etdim.
This is not for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin däl.
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
This is so stupid.	Bu gaty samsyk.
We need them and they need us.	Bize mätäç we olar bize mätäç.
This is everything and everything else.	Bu hemme zat we başga zatlar.
Then he went home again.	Soň bolsa ýene öýüne gitdi.
Not really enough.	Aslynda ýeterlik däl.
I do that	Men muny edýärin
Not long.	Uzak däl.
He came home.	Ol öýüne geldi.
I had to do it.	Men muny etmeli boldum.
Not great, not great.	Ajaýyp däl, ajaýyp.
He could never really tell.	Ol hiç haçan hakykatdanam aýdyp bilmedi.
Of course it should be.	Elbetde şeýle bolmaly.
I really know that.	Men muny hakykatdanam bilýärin.
He doesn't know that.	Muny bilmeýär.
I want to do that right.	Men muny dogry etmek isleýärin.
He told her the truth.	Oňa hakykaty aýtdy.
It doesn't seem right.	Dogry däl ýaly.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
There was something else.	Başga bir zat hem bardy.
He did not immediately respond.	Ol derrew jogap bermedi.
What happened here today was not a mistake.	Şu gün bu ýerde bolup geçen zatlar ýalňyşlyk däldi.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
How long should I go?	Näçe wagt gitmeli?
It's not that bad.	Ol beýle erbet däl.
I have something.	Mende bir zat bar.
This may be true.	Munuň özi dogry bolup biler.
Now there was absolutely no way to do that.	Indi muny etmäge düýbünden ýol ýokdy.
I had to worry.	Alada etmeli boldum.
No one can say no to us.	Hiç kim bize “ýok” diýip bilmez.
It can help if needed.	Gerek bolsa kömek edip biler.
Here	Bu ýerde.
It couldn't be easier.	Çynlakaý aňsat bolup bilmedi.
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
You can even say something.	Hatda bir zat aýdyp bilersiňiz.
This is my hope.	Bu maňa umyt.
No problem.	Mesele bolmaz.
There is no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýok.
Of course.	Elbetde.
That was not enough.	Bu entek ýeterlik däldi.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
Couldn't be.	Bolup bilmedi.
Buying more, of course.	Elbetde has köp zat satyn almak.
This is crazy.	Bu däli zat.
I don’t know why or when it happened.	Näme üçin ýa-da haçan bolandygyny bilemok.
What a strange word.	Nähili geň söz.
I have to be there	Men ol ýerde bolmaly
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I didn't know why or how.	Näme üçin ýa-da nädip bilmedim.
It was not easy to do that.	Muny etmek aňsat däldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Uly mesele.
I haven't thought about it yet.	Men entek pikir etmedim.
I don't want to think about anything.	Men hiç zat hakda pikir etmek islämok.
Every year.	Her ýyl.
He didn't want to talk to me.	Ol meniň bilen gürleşmek islemedi.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
A little	Biraz.
I have	Mende bar
That's a lot of noise.	Bu gaty köp ses.
He took us completely.	Ol bizi doly aldy.
I only heard about it yesterday.	Men bu hakda diňe düýn eşitdim.
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
It turned out well.	Gowy çykdy.
I thought about it for a few days.	Bu hakda birnäçe gün pikir etdim.
For help	Kömek üçin
It could be better.	Has gowy bolup biler.
The police are not coming.	Polisiýa gelenok.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
It will not be difficult to do that.	Muny etmek kyn bolmaz.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
Maybe that night.	Belki, şol gije.
So it was hard to know.	Şonuň üçin muny bilmek kyn boldy.
He can't get it.	Ol muny alyp bilenok.
It was a close call.	Bu ýakyn jaň boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, muny etmeli.
And then there was nothing.	Soň bolsa hiç zat ýokdy.
He will.	Ol eder.
This time he answered.	Bu gezek jogap berdi.
You have to give it to him.	Oňa bermeli.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
You may need it.	Size gerek bolup biler.
I think this will be really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
Everything is there.	Ol ýerde hemme zat bar.
He is not himself.	Ol özi däl.
There are two possible reasons for this.	Belki, munuň iki sebäbi bar.
Both are on the ground.	Ikisi-de ýerde.
This book was very difficult, but not difficult.	Bu kitap gaty kyn, ýöne kyn däldi.
That was not the case before.	Ozal beýle däldi.
This is a really difficult decision.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn karar.
I heard that.	Men muny eşitdim.
This is often the case.	Bu köplenç şeýle bolýar.
I believe this could be something else.	Munuň başga bir zat bolup biljekdigine ynanýaryn.
He is crazy about me.	Ol meniň hakda däli.
For several years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
We will never be.	Biz asla bolmaz.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki, muny etmek zerur däl bolsa gerek.
I'm not at home.	Men öýde däl.
I was completely alone.	Men düýbünden ýeke boldum.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
This is not a thing.	Bu bir zat däl.
And still go to school.	We henizem mekdebe gitmek.
I can't think of any good reason.	Hiç hili gowy sebäp hakda pikir edip bilemok.
That's what I did.	Ine, men etdim.
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
He immediately reported the matter to police.	Derrew polisiýa habar berdi.
So sorry	Şonuň üçin bagyşlaň.
There is one person now.	Häzirki wagtda bir adam bar.
I'm serious.	Men çynlakaý.
Not necessarily.	Hökman däl.
What happened.	Näme boldy.
I want that	Men muny isleýärin
It just takes time.	Oňa diňe wagt gerek.
Of course.	Elbetde.
A lot of guys came.	Köp ýigit geldi.
He thought no one else could.	Başga hiç kim edip bilmez diýip pikir etdi.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
No words were needed.	Hiç hili söz gerek däldi.
He has to go and he has to go now.	Ol gitmeli we şu wagt gitmeli.
It's you.	Bu sen.
Not at all.	Hiç haçan däl.
I have to say.	Men aýtmaly.
It's not easy to answer.	Jogap bermek aňsat däl.
He seemed to be fine with that.	Ol munuň bilen gowy ýalydy.
Not that week.	Şol hepde däl.
He is already gone.	Ol eýýäm gitdi.
What?	Näme?
No one.	Hiç kim ýok.
That's great.	Munuň özi gaty gowy.
I don't need that kind of work.	Maňa beýle iş gerek däl.
This is so bad!	Bu gaty erbet!
They will not agree.	Olar gaty razy bolmaz.
It is as if no one knows the truth.	Hiç kim hakykaty bilmeýän ýaly.
You don't have to do everything.	Hemme zady etmeli däl.
I hope this was good for you too.	Bu hem siziň üçin gowy boldy diýip umyt edýärin.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat gaty gowy.
He didn't want to do anything else.	Oňa başga bir zat etmek islemedi.
He will be here.	Ol şu ýerde bolar.
Maybe the police are back.	Belki, polisiýa gaýdyp geldi.
It's not tomorrow.	Iş ertir däl.
The voice called again.	Ses ýene jaň etdi.
Nothing very interesting here.	Bu ýerde gaty gyzykly zat ýok.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
Good job	Gowy iş.
He was not there.	Ol ýerde ýokdy.
No one really thinks so.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam beýle pikir etmeýär.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
No, not yet.	Ýok, entek däl.
He did not want to do that before.	Mundan ozal beýle etmek islemedi.
No one wants it at all.	Hiç kim muny asla islemeýär.
It's beautiful, it's beautiful.	Bu ajaýyp, düýbünden ajaýyp.
It seems interesting.	Gyzykly ýaly.
It's really hard.	Hakykatdanam gaty kyn.
Not many, but several.	Köp däl, ýöne birnäçe.
I will do it	Men muny ederin
Maybe it will be good.	Belki gowy bolar.
He didn't have to.	Ol bolmaly däldi.
I don't know anything about myself	Özüm hakda hiç zat bilemok
It could be.	Bu bolup biler.
It happened too.	Ol hem boldy.
He decided to do it.	Ol bu barada karar berdi.
It's long gone.	Uzak gitdi.
He destroyed me.	Ol meni ýok etdi.
So it takes time.	Şonuň üçin wagt gerek.
I will be.	Men bolaryn.
In fact, more.	Aslynda has köp.
It's been a long time coming.	Aslynda gaty uzak wagt.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
I still enjoyed doing it.	Men henizem muny etmek bilen hezil etdim.
Happy	Bagtly
I have to be here.	Men şu ýerde bolmaly.
There can be no other reason.	Başga bir sebäp bolup bilmez.
Go, have fun.	Bar, hezil et.
It seemed impossible.	Mümkin däl ýalydy.
Everyone wants money!	Her kim pul isleýär!
Just say it out loud.	Diňe gaty ses bilen aýdyň.
Of course, nothing else will happen.	Elbetde, başga hiç zat bolmaz.
He was very good tonight.	Ol şu gije gaty gowy boldy.
He says.	Ol aýdýar.
It was not like that.	Bu onuň ýaly däldi.
It can even be good.	Ol hatda gowy bolup biler.
To let us know.	Bize habar bermek üçin.
In fact, every word.	Aslynda her söz.
What a difficult question.	Bu nähili kyn sorag.
There were a lot of people for me.	Meniň üçin köp adam bardy.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
He left this morning.	Ol şu gün irden gitdi.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
I never did that.	Men hiç wagt beýle zady etmedim.
Isn't that bad? 	Erbet dälmi?
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
I hope so.	Bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
There was no time for that.	Munuň üçin wagt ýokdy.
Adam.	Adam.
It may take a little while.	Biraz köp zat gerek bolup biler.
You seemed to need me.	Sen maňa gerek ýalydy.
It's coming.	Gelýär.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
He is right there.	Ol edil şol ýerde.
We are happy together.	Biz bilelikde bagtly.
It was still new.	Bu henizem täze boldy.
That sounds like a weird question.	Bu geň sorag ýaly.
It’s not just an easy task.	Diňe bu aňsat iş däl.
I never had to go there.	Men ol ýere hiç haçan gitmeli däldim.
I've had it for a long time.	Mende köp wagt boldy.
I'm not that big.	Men beýle uly däl.
Really with someone.	Hakykatdanam kimdir biri bilen.
He has said this before.	Ol muny öňem aýtdy.
And today it will be difficult.	Bu gün bolsa kyn bolar.
They need you here.	Olar size şu ýerde gerek.
It was impossible to be ready for him.	Oňa taýyn bolmagy mümkin däldi.
It must be you.	Bu sen bolmaly.
They are not.	Olar beýle däl.
There was nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.
It's beautiful and.	Bu owadan we.
Knowing he was crazy.	Onuň däli bolandygyny bilmek.
This can never happen.	Bu hiç zat bolup bilmez.
I couldn't even get it.	Muny hatda alyp bilmedim.
I have nothing to do.	Etjek zadym ýok.
Only happy, happy, happy.	Diňe bagtly, bagtly, bagtly.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu seniň etjek zadyň.
I'm new here.	Men bu ýerde täze.
So we are still together.	Şonuň üçin biz henizem bile.
I think three months is too short.	Meniň pikirimçe, üç aý gaty gysga.
He didn't want anything.	Ol hiç zat islemedi.
I can't do it tonight.	Şu gije edip bilemok.
It's a big deal.	Uly zat bolýar.
I don't know	Men muny bilemok
He hoped	Ol umyt etdi
He didn't have to do that either.	Ol muny hem etmeli däldi.
The sound is also bad.	Ses hem erbet.
It's hard to get that.	Muny almak kyn.
I saw the truth.	Men hakykaty gördüm.
He did too.	Ol hem etdi.
About two things.	Iki zat hakda.
We can't be here all night.	Biz bu ýerde bütin gije bolup bilmeris.
This is a crazy song.	Bu däli aýdym.
Just not right.	Diňe dogry däl.
He did a good job.	Gowy iş etdi.
I have to.	Men etmeli.
You have to do that.	Şeýle etmeli.
I don't need anything.	Maňa hiç zat gerek däl.
He took everything.	Ol hemme zady aldy.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
He is coming back.	Ol gaýdyp gelýär.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I really don't mind.	Men hakykatdanam garşy däl.
Not now, not yet.	Häzir däl, entek däl.
It really is.	Hakykatdanam şeýle.
No one said anything about it.	Hiç kim bu barada hiç zat aýtmady.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
Now is the time.	Indi wagt geldi.
It did.	Bu etdi.
I don't think twice.	Iki gezek pikir etmeýärin.
It was a weekend.	Dynç güni boldy.
A voice came out, of course.	Bir ses çykdy, elbetde.
No one is going to help you.	Hiç kim size kömek etjek däl.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
There was also no one.	Şeýle hem hiç kim ýokdy.
Then this police can do whatever they want.	Soň bu polisiýa islän zadyny edip biler.
You have to call the police.	Polisiýa jaň etmeli.
This is not what we need.	Bu bize zerur zat däl.
I had to leave this morning.	Şu gün ir gitmeli boldum.
He was a little surprised.	Ol birneme geň galdy.
Except for me, of course.	Menden başga, elbetde.
I have no idea.	Mende düýbünden pikir ýok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu, bir zat bolsa, gowy habar.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
I could not	Bolup bilmedim
"We have to do something," he said.	Ol: "Biz bir zat etmeli" -diýdi.
That's great	Bu uly
What's going on here?	Bu ýerde näme bolýar.
Nothing will be easy.	Hiç zat aňsat bolmaz.
Of course, I could never do that.	Elbetde, beýle zady asla edip bilmedim.
I think it will be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
He bought her a book.	Ol oňa kitap satyn aldy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
I don't know what caused it.	Muňa näme sebäp bolandygyny bilemok.
Anything can happen then.	Şol wagt hemme zat bolup biler.
It was not just us.	Bu diňe biz däldi.
I hope so.	Şeýle eder diýip umyt edýärin.
I didn't see it that way.	Men beýle görmedim.
That alone was not possible.	Diňe bu mümkin däldi.
We need it the most right now.	Häzirki wagtda biz oňa iň mätäç.
They look very young.	Olar gaty ýaş görünýär.
I'm not for that money.	Men bu pul üçin däl.
He told me everything.	Ol maňa hemmesini aýtdy.
Money.	Pul.
Of course you have to do that.	Elbetde, muny etmeli.
He ignored it.	Ol muňa üns bermedi.
I was very busy.	Men gaty meşgul boldum.
I need it.	Maňa gerek.
I'm happy about that.	Men muňa begenýärin.
This is not possible.	Bu gaty mümkin däl.
I can't help it.	Men oňa kömek edip bilemok.
Then an adult came.	Soň uly adam geldi.
There are several interesting reasons for this.	Munuň üçin birnäçe gyzykly sebäp bar.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
He has been doing this for two years.	Iki ýyl bäri şeýle edýär.
I don't need anything else.	Başga bir zat gerek däl.
I can't take it anymore	Indi alyp bilemok
It's very difficult here.	Bu ýerde gaty kyn.
I would agree with that.	Men muňa razy bolaryn.
That's all you have to do.	Bu seniň etmeli zadyň.
He is right there.	Ol edil şol ýerde.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
Oh, well said.	Aý, gowy aýtdy.
I hope so, maybe.	Biraz umyt edýärin, belki.
You know, really beautiful.	Bilýärsiň, hakykatdanam owadan.
I do nothing.	Men hiç zat etmeýärin.
Two men came to the rescue.	Iki adam kömek etmäge geldi.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili zat ýokdy.
Today is not the day.	Bu gün ol gün däl.
Ma'am.	Bu.
Often there was no problem.	Köplenç mesele ýokdy.
It can't be about money once.	Bir gezek pul hakda bolup bilmez.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
With you	Seniň bilen
I was not for that.	Men munuň üçin däldim.
I need a watch.	Sagat gerek.
He could not get it.	Ol muny alyp bilmedi.
He was surprised to see her.	Ony görüp geň galdy.
This is very good news.	Bu gaty bagtly habar.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
He is not very good.	Ol gaty gowy däl.
Long time no see	Uzak wagt.
He gave everything.	Ol hemme zady berdi.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
She looks younger.	Ol has ýaş görünýär.
I thought it would be good.	Oňa gowy bolar öýdüpdim.
Maybe very good.	Belki gaty gowy.
This is absolutely.	Bu düýbünden.
That's a good idea.	Bu gowy teklip.
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
This man	Bu adam
He just asked a question.	Ol diňe sorag berdi.
It won't be that bad.	Bu beýle erbet bolmaz.
It's hard to call.	Jaň etmek kyn.
It was not difficult.	Kyn däldi.
Everything and everyone.	Hemme zat we hemmeler.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
It was also short.	Şeýle hem, ol gysga boldy.
I didn’t really think much.	Men hakykatdanam kän pikir etmedim.
Because it is.	Sebäbi şeýle.
You have to report it to the police.	Polisiýa habar bermeli.
He said it could happen.	Bolup biljekdigini aýtdy.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Has gowy ýol.
So young and beautiful.	Şonuň üçin ýaş we owadan.
No one is happy.	Hiç kim bagtly däl.
This was not a strange request.	Bu geň haýyş däldi.
Doing everything right, but these things can still happen.	Hemme zady dogry etmek, ýöne bu zatlar henizem bolup biler.
Of course, this is not the only issue.	Elbetde, bu ýeke-täk mesele däl.
I only have myself.	Mende diňe özüm bar.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I am nothing.	Men hiç zat däl.
There must be someone who doesn't.	Kimdir biri ýok adam bolmaly.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe bir ýa-da ikisi etmeli.
It can't be new.	Täze bolup bilmez.
In fact, probably.	Aslynda, ähtimal.
It was impossible to say.	Muny aýtmak mümkin däldi.
It may seem easy, but it is not.	Bu aňsat ýaly bolup biler, ýöne beýle däl.
This is for us too.	Bu hem biziň üçin.
Maybe not.	Belki beýle bolmaz.
Of course, he did not agree with me.	Elbetde, ol menden razy däldi.
He went too far.	Ol gaty uzak gitdi.
I want it now.	Men şu wagt isleýärin.
It makes him very human.	Bu ony gaty adam edýär.
I have something to do.	Meniň etmeli zadym bar.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
I know a lot about you.	Men senden köp zady bilýärin.
For her and me.	Onuň we meniň üçin.
That’s when things started to get interesting.	Şol wagt zatlar gyzykly bolup başlady.
This is strange for me.	Meniň üçin bu geň.
I knew it wasn't going to happen.	Munuň beýle bolmaly däldigini bilýärdim.
There was a loud noise.	Gaty ses çykdy.
I didn't know that.	Men muny bilmeýärdim.
I'll have to call him.	Men oňa jaň edip, jaň etmeli bolaryn.
What happened	Näme boldy?
Okay.	Bolýar.
I am alone	Men ýeke.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
It wasn't the best day, but it wasn't the worst.	Iň gowy gün däldi, ýöne erbet däldi.
You know it's for money.	Munuň pul üçin bardygyny bilýärsiň.
You can do the same.	Şeýle hem edip bilersiňiz.
Only permission.	Diňe rugsat.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
A lot of things.	Köp zat.
I know.	Men bilýärin.
Maybe he can't do it with me.	Belki, ol meniň bilen edip bilmez.
You have to help.	Kömek etmeli.
Of course, there was something wrong.	Elbetde, bu ýerde ýalňyşlyk bardy.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
It will always be.	Elmydama bolar.
I did.	Men etdim.
No one answered.	Hiç kim jogap bermedi.
Also, they are not in a better place.	Şeýle hem, olar has gowy ýerde däl.
Definitely great.	Elbetde, gaty gowy.
He can do anything.	Hemme zady edip bilýär.
I decided.	Men karar berdim.
To give, to give, to give.	Bermek, bermek, bermek.
To the party.	Oturylyşyga.
This is an interesting question.	Bu gyzykly sorag.
Who lives here?	Bu ýerde kim ýaşaýar?
Whatever.	Näme bolsa.
He doesn't like us.	Ol bizi halamaýar.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
It was not his thing.	Bu onuň zady däldi.
He even called the police.	Ol hatda polisiýa jaň etdi.
Good.	Gowy.
He did not answer me.	Ol maňa jogap bermedi.
A week ago.	Bir hepde öň.
I didn't have to say that.	Men beýle zatlary aýtmaly däldim.
I hope this helps!	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin!
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň sebäbi we ol menden sorady.
Big.	Uly.
No need.	Gerek däldi.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
What a mistake.	Nähili ýalňyşlyk.
Of course, this is not money.	Elbetde, bu pul däl.
There has to be a better way.	Has gowy ýol bolmaly.
This man did not.	Bu adam etmedi.
He wanted to.	Ol isledi.
I have a better idea.	Mende has gowy pikir bar.
This may be strange.	Bu geň bolup biler.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
I haven't done it yet.	Men entek etmedim.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
There was no problem.	Kynçylyk ýokdy.
I can't think of anything else.	Başga hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilemok.
One day he had an idea.	Bir gün oňa bir pikir geldi.
I must have seen this before.	Men muny öňem gören bolmaly.
He objected.	Ol muňa garşy çykdy.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
Everyone wants money.	Her kim pul isleýär.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
I do not agree with that.	Men muňa razy däl.
We are not like that at all.	Biz asla beýle däl.
Vote for us.	Bize ses bermek.
He did not want to call me with this message.	Ol bu habar bilen maňa jaň etmek islemedi.
You have to do a lot.	Köp etmeli.
You have to worry.	Alada etmeli.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I can't think of it.	Men bu barada pikir edip bilemok.
I'm not ready.	Men beýle taýyn däl.
Then again a week later.	Soň bolsa bir hepde soň ýene bir gezek.
He is right there.	Ol edil şol ýerde.
I don't know what.	Men näme bilemok.
He was there again.	Ol ýerde ýene bardy.
We will never know that.	Muny hiç haçan bilmeris.
I don’t think he had much.	Meniň pikirimçe, onuň kän zady ýokdy.
I'd like to have one.	Men saňa birini almak isleýärin.
This is not for me.	Bu meniň üçin däl.
Good and bad.	Gowy we erbet.
It's over.	Bu indi.
Because he is.	Sebäbi ol.
He is not good at all.	Ol asla gowy däl.
I think that's great.	Bu gaty gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
He thought he must have seen it somewhere.	Ol muny bir ýerde gören bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
It could have been worse, and it was.	Has erbet bolup biler we şeýle boldy.
Maybe it will.	Belki bolar.
I have to go now.	Men häzir gitmeli.
So it can’t be too much.	Şonuň üçin kän bolup bilmez.
He always does the same thing.	Elmydama şol bir zady edýär.
He will take care of you.	Ol size alada eder.
You have to do this every morning!	Muny her gün irden etmeli!.
This is really strange.	Bu hakykatdanam geň.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
He can get it.	Ol alyp biler.
Not everyone was so happy.	Hemmeler beýle bir bagtly däldi.
It would be right.	Dogry bolardy.
It was very new.	Gaty täze boldy.
I know, I don't like it here.	Bilýän, bu ýerde halamok.
He said it would be good.	Gowy boljakdygyny aýtdy.
I don't know much about him.	Men ol hakda kän bilemok.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
It is not wise to do so.	Etmek akylly zat däl.
I can tell you completely, that's not the case.	Size doly aýdyp bilerin, beýle däl.
There is no time like the present.	Häzirki ýaly wagt ýok.
Big is good.	Uly bolsa gowy.
You can do better.	Has gowy edip bilersiňiz.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
He knew he had to do something.	Ol bir zatlar etmelidigini bilýärdi.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
It's not about them.	Bu olar hakda däl.
How wonderful it is.	Bu nähili ajaýyp.
The pleasure was not so happy.	Lezzet beýle bir bagtly däldi.
He went to work.	Ol işe gitdi.
I didn't do that.	Men bu meseläni beýle etmedim.
He asked what he could do for them.	Olar üçin näme edip biljekdigini sorady.
It's been a few years.	Birnäçe ýyl boldy.
She is actually a very beautiful girl.	Aslynda gaty owadan gyz.
A lot of fun.	Köp gyzykly.
It seems like a few hours.	Birnäçe sagat ýaly görünýär.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine iň uly mesele.
It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
It will no longer be.	Ol indi bolmaz.
No one answered.	Hiç kim jogap bermedi.
I had that opportunity.	Mende şeýle mümkinçilik bardy.
This decision was correct.	Bu karar dogry boldy.
We don't need it.	Bize gerek däl.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
This time something else happened.	Bu gezek başga zat boldy.
We are not there yet.	Biz entek ýok.
This is not true today.	Bu gün bu dogry däl.
He asked.	Ol sorady.
I hope it helps!	Kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin!
He did a short job about it.	Ol hakda gysga iş etdi.
It really can't be helped.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek edip bolmaz.
That's a lot.	Bu köp boldy.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty ajaýyp.
What's the big deal? 	Uly mesele näme?
he says.	ol aýdýar.
And a great opportunity.	We uly mümkinçilik.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
It will be great.	Ol ajaýyp bolar.
It will not be difficult.	Bu kyn bolmaz.
That's enough for me.	Bu meniň üçin ýeterlik.
It says a lot about you, about them.	Bu sen hakda, olar hakda köp zat aýdýar.
We tell you that.	Biz muňa aýdyň.
In fact, this is not true.	Aslynda bu dogry däl.
This is not really enough.	Bu hakykatdanam ýeterlik däl.
Weekend	Dynç güni.
OK, maybe not.	Bolýar, belki ýok.
That's good.	Gowy hem.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
It's easy everywhere.	Hemme ýerde aňsat bolýar.
Someone else.	Başga biri.
There is no problem here.	Bu ýerde hiç hili mesele ýok.
He gave everything.	Ol hemme zady berdi.
It's weird, isn't it?	Geň bir zat, şeýlemi?
Not so.	Beýle däl.
He returned a week later.	Bir hepde soň bolsa gaýdyp geldi.
And then more difficult.	Soň bolsa has kyn.
It's really beautiful.	Aslynda gaty owadan.
He asked that morning.	Ol şol gün irden sorady.
There was no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýokdy.
Three things happened today.	Şu gün üç zat boldy.
He will do it.	Ol muny eder.
There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
He became more serious.	Ol has çynlakaý boldy.
He has to go now.	Ol indi gitmeli.
No one knows the truth.	Hiç kim hakykaty bilmeýär.
I never knew.	Men hiç wagt bilmeýärdim.
This is a long time.	Bu köp wagt.
But this is not true.	Bu ýöne dogry däl.
Most words.	Iň köp söz.
I definitely agree.	Men hökman razy.
He wants to be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolmak isleýär.
I was not.	Men beýle däldim.
Not much.	Köp däl.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Who wants the next one.	Indiki kim isleýär.
I have no other choice. '	Mende başga ýol ýok '.
He didn't want to do anything.	Ol hiç zat etmek islemedi.
He has time and plenty.	Onuň wagty bar we köp.
There was no one.	Hiç kim ýokdy.
I was not at all surprised.	Men düýbünden geň görmedim.
It was like a few hours.	Birnäçe sagat ýalydy.
I never had my own thing.	Hiç haçan öz zadym ýokdy.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe özi bilen alada etmeli.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
He got it fast.	Ol muny çalt aldy.
To do well.	Gowy etmek.
I didn't know what.	Men näme bilmedim.
It can't be right, it can't be right.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez, dogry bolup bilmez.
This is a very good question.	Bu gaty gowy sorag.
A lot happens.	Köp zat bolýar.
It was a short journey.	Bu gysga ýol boldy.
That was the case at the time.	Şol wagt şeýle boldy.
Of course, this is a very difficult issue.	Elbetde, bu gaty kyn mesele.
I beg you	Maňa haýyş edýärin.
It didn't look good to him.	Oňa gowy däl ýalydy.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
A few days, usually a week.	Birnäçe gün, köplenç bir hepde.
She was worried.	Onuň üçin alada galdy.
I said a lot about myself.	Özüm hakda gaty köp zat aýtdym.
It can be very difficult.	Gaty kyn bolup biler.
I want to spend time with you alone.	Seniň bilen ýeke wagt isleýärin.
You can try this.	Muny synap bilersiňiz.
The biggest mistake	Iň uly ýalňyşlyk
Seems to say more.	Has köp zat aýtmak isleýän ýaly.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu dogry jogap ýok sorag.
The same is true this year.	Bu ýyl hem edil şonuň ýaly.
I do that	Men muny edýärin
No one knew.	Hiç kim hiç zady bilmeýärdi.
Nothing is enough.	Hiç zat ýeterlik däl.
I'm really happy for her.	Men onuň üçin hakykatdanam bagtly.
It's a little hard to say.	Söz bilen aýtmak biraz kyn.
Because a big bad thing must be very stupid.	Sebäbi uly erbet zat gaty samsyk bolmaly.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
What?	Näme?
She is worried.	Ol alada edýär.
Then again.	Soň ýene.
Now he had to admit, he got it.	Indi boýun almaly boldy, aldy.
I did it twice.	Iki gezek etdim.
No one can help you.	Hiç kim size kömek edip bilmez.
I'm like everyone else.	Men hemmeler ýaly.
Not smart.	Akylly däl.
That day has come.	Şol gün geldi.
I thought it would be better tomorrow.	Ertir has gowy bolar diýip pikir etdim.
I know he doesn't.	Men onuň ýokdugyny bilýärin.
I don't know how that happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilenok.
This is his.	Bu onuň.
I can promise you.	Men size söz berip bilerin.

Something else can happen.	Başga bir zat bolup biler.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
No more sun.	Indi gün ýok.
They are bad.	Olar erbet.
This did not help.	Bu kömek etmedi.
We are not young.	Biz ýaş däl.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
There seems to be only one way to do that.	Munuň üçin diňe bir ýol bar ýaly.
I thought it was really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy diýip pikir etdim.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
It doesn't seem like it anymore.	Indi beýle däl ýaly.
This is the right time.	Bu dogry wagt.

He told us everything.	Ol bize hemme zady aýtdy.
We are not alone.	Biz ýeke däl.
I do very well	Men gaty gowy edýärin
No one should have said that.	Hiç kim muny aýtmaly däldi.
He already knew.	Öň bilýärdi.

I need an answer.	Maňa jogap gerek.
You always have to tell the truth.	Elmydama hakykaty aýtmaly.
This is not the case for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin beýle däl.
There is no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýok.
You are not ready yet.	Siz entek taýyn däl.

No one else knows this exists.	Munuň bardygyny başga hiç kim bilenok.
There was no one in the house.	Öýde hiç kim ýokdy.
This man.	Bu adam.
There are two weeks.	Iki hepde bar.
He was really alone now.	Ol hakykatdanam indi ýeke boldy.
We just can't do it.	Diňe edip bilmeris.
Of course, now it's his.	Elbetde, indi onuň.
The more, the better.	Has köp, has gowy bolar.
It wasn’t just crazy.	Bu diňe däli däldi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki hakykatdanam şeýle.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
This is strange now.	Bu indi geň.
I still don't know what to do.	Näme etmelidigimi henizem bilemok.

So the time has come.	Şonuň üçin wagt geldi.

For the future.	Geljek üçin.

Really nice guy.	Hakykatdanam ajaýyp ýigit.

At most two.	Iň köp iki.
Not many people can do that.	Köp adam muny edip bilenok.
He did not ask himself any questions.	Ol özüne hiç hili sorag bermedi.

About everyone and everything.	Hemmeler we hemme zat hakda.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty ajaýyp.
Well, man.	Gowy, adam.
Hard and absolutely beautiful.	Gaty we düýbünden owadan.
You are one of them.	Sen onuň biri.

How is this possible?	Bu nädip mümkin?
No one else said that.	Muny başga hiç kim aýtmady.

It was today.	Bu gün boldy.
You are very young	Sen gaty ýaş
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.

Just like a year ago.	Bir ýyl öňküsi ýaly.

He could do it all.	Ol hemmesini edip bilýärdi.
I still did.	Men henizem etdim.
I heard a short voice.	Gysga ses eşitdim.

Difficult, but not impossible.	Kyn, ýöne mümkin däl.
Good.	Gowy.
You will be happy every once in a while.	Her gezek bir gezek bagtly bolarsyňyz.
The police have yet to respond.	Polisiýa entek muňa jogap bermeli däl.
There was something strange about it.	Bu ýerde geň bir zat bardy.

No one did that.	Hiç kim muny etmedi.
He did very well.	Ol gaty gowy etdi.
This is the first time he has done this.	Ol muny ilkinji gezek etdi.
So there are things like that.	Şonuň üçin şeýle zatlar bar.
I think something like that should happen.	Munuň ýaly bir zat bolmaly diýip pikir edýärin.
I have to go	Men gitmeli
Of course he does.	Elbetde şeýle edýär.
This is a big deal.	Bu uly mesele.
He could see it.	Ol muny görüp bilýärdi.
A few months ago.	Birnäçe aý öň.
I know that.	Muny bilýärin.
He did nothing else.	Mundan başga hiç zat etmedi.
Is there any help? 	Kömek barmy?
It's been here for three years.	Bu ýerde üç ýyl bäri.

I'm serious here.	Men bu ýerde çynlakaý.
He did the same.	Ol hem şeýle etdi.
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
I let him.	Men oňa ýol berdim.
I have a lot of doubts about that.	Men muňa gaty şübhelenýärin.
You can't help it.	Oňa kömek edip bolmaz.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
I bought it	Men ony satyn aldym
I think he's there.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şol ýerde.
He did nothing to find out what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilmek üçin hiç zat etmedi.
There was something about him.	Ol hakda bir zat bardy.
Last time for you	Iň soňky gezek siziň üçin
I can never say.	Hiç wagt aýdyp bilemok.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
Only there.	Diňe şol ýerde.
Both.	Ikisi.
Of course not.	Elbetde ýok.
Maybe a few years ago.	Belki birnäçe ýyl ozal.
I do not know.	Bilemok.
It was fun.	Gyzykly boldy.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
This is not a problem for you.	Bu siziň üçin mesele däl.
He knew it by heart.	Ol muny gaty ýatdan bilýärdi.
It should be good.	Ol gowy bolmaly.
Difficult, difficult, difficult.	Kyn, kyn, kyn.
Everyone wants to do more.	Her kim has köp zat etmek isleýär.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
I have	Mende bar
Somehow.	Bir hili.
So it was not enough to know.	Şonuň üçin bilmek ýeterlik däldi.
He is not young.	Ol ýaş däl.
Not too hard.	Gaty kyn däl.
I thought we were happy together.	Biz bilelikde bagtly diýip pikir etdim.
You have to go home.	Öýe gitmeli.
Good.	Gowy.
She is no more.	Ol indi gelenok.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
Not necessarily.	Hökman däl.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
Because that's it.	Sebäbi ol şol.
It's as if no one can help her.	Hiç kim oňa kömek edip bilmeýän ýaly.
Many times	Köp gezek.
That's the problem.	Ine, kynçylyk gelýär.
You have the opportunity.	Size mümkinçilik boldy.
He knew he had to.	Etmeli däldigini bilýärdi.
He did not want to.	Ol islemedi.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
He never did that.	Ol muny hiç wagt etmedi.
He said he had.	Ol bardygyny aýtdy.
He has no business.	Onuň işi ýok.
I trust you completely.	Men size doly ynanýaryn.
How can this be? 	Bu nädip bolup biler?
It's three o'clock.	Sagat üç boldy.
Anyone can do that.	Her kim muny edip biler.
He was completely alone.	Ol düýbünden ýeke boldy.
He never did and never will.	Hiç haçan etmedi we bolmaz.
I have never seen so much.	Hiç haçan beýle köp görmedim.
Someone else.	Başga biri.
I can give you a job.	Men size iş berip bilerin.
To him, to himself.	Oňa, özüne.
He doesn't need anything.	Oňa hiç zat gerek däl.
This is just a day.	Bu diňe bir gün.
What does a person do for a living?	Adam durmuş üçin näme edýär?
She is worried.	Ol alada edýär.
I think that's different for everyone.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hemmeler üçin başga.
And then there is the hard time.	Soň bolsa gaty kyn wagt.
Current	Häzirki.
It will never happen to them.	Hiç haçan olar bilen düýbünden bolmaz.
Nowadays no one does that and things look good.	Häzirki wagtda hiç kim muny etmeýär we zatlar gowy görünýär.
This is the first issue.	Bu ilkinji mesele.
They are not now.	Olar häzir däl.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
That's right.	Dogry ýaly.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Not money right now.	Häzirki wagtda pul däl.
And now there is no reason for anyone to think so.	Indi bolsa hiç kimiň pikir etmegine hiç hili sebäp ýok.
They were everywhere.	Olar hemme ýerde bardy.
There is only one.	Diňe biri bar.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
It looks better.	Has gowy görünýär.
I knew it.	Men muny bilýärdim.
Maybe three.	Belki üç bolup biler.
Very good with me.	Meniň bilen gaty gowy.
Difficult but interesting.	Kyn, ýöne gyzykly.
In fact, everyone.	Aslynda hemmeler.
I always knew.	Men hemişe bilýärdim.
I do nothing.	Hiç zat etmeýärin.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
Many people did.	Köp adam şeýle etdi.
I think we need that.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu bize gerek.
I didn’t want to hurt anyone.	Men hiç kime zyýan bermek islemedim.
It must be so interesting.	Şeýle gyzykly bolmaly.
He could do whatever he wanted with him.	Onuň bilen islän zadyny edip bilýärdi.
He will not object.	Ol muňa garşy bolmaz.
Okay.	Bolýar.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
Of course this is not true.	Elbetde bu dogry däl.
'or go'.	'ýa-da gitmek'.
He gave it to me.	Maňa berdi.
That girl was crazy.	Ol gyz däli boldy.
This is not necessarily a good thing.	Bu hökman gowy zat däl.
I'm not sure why this still exists.	Munuň näme üçin henizem bardygyny doly bilemok.
In fact, it is a lie.	Hakykatdanam, bu ýalan.
What? 	Näme?
If it hadn't been for that before, it would have been now.	Öň çynlakaý däl bolsa, indi bolardy.
It was not necessary.	Bu gerek däldi.
I don’t know why this happened.	Munuň näme üçin bolandygyny bilemok.
Just something else.	Diňe başga bir zat.
It took me and myself.	Bu meni we özümi aldy.
I think this is very necessary.	Bu gaty zerur diýip pikir edýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine iň gyzykly zat.
There must be someone else.	Başga biri bolmaly.
Of course it is.	Elbetde şeýle.
This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
He asked me if I had enough.	Ol menden we meniň üçin ýeterlik diýip sorady.
This is still true.	Bu henizem dogry.
I don't know what to do.	Näme etmelidigini bilenok.
This is also not true.	Bu hem dogry däl.
About us.	Biz hakda.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
It will never be enough.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik bolmaz.
Isn't that what you want?	Bu seniň isleýän zadyň dälmi?
I'm scared.	Men gorkýaryn.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilenok.
Because there weren't many.	Sebäbi kän däldi.
Of course, he knew nothing.	Elbetde, hiç zat bilmeýärdi.
He is just a bad person.	Ol diňe erbet adam.
I'm worried.	Alada edýärin.
In fact, nothing.	Aslynda hiç zat.
They are not like us.	Olar biziň ýaly däl.
No one can.	Hiç kim edip bilmez.
Tonight	Bu gije.
Two guys came out.	Iki ýigit çykdy.

Only, it will not.	Diňe, bolmaz.
He was also surprised.	Ol hem geň galdy.

This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
Very beautiful.	Gaty owadan.

That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
Oh, no.	Aý, ýok.

This is the only way.	Bu ýeke-täk ýol.
For three months.	Üç aý bäri.

He does what he wants to do.	Etjek bolýan zadyny edýär.
He started going to her.	Oňa baryp başlady.
It was fun at the time.	Şol wagt hezil boldy.
Good girl	Gowy gyz.
He had to do more.	Has köp zat etmeli boldy.
There may be two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bolup biler.
Strange thing.	Geň zat.
Many people did.	Köp adam etdi.
They are not so bad.	Olar beýle erbet däl.
He just wanted to help.	Ol diňe kömek etjek boldy.
Really hard to see.	Hakykatdanam gaty görmek.
It will do the same.	Bu hem edil şonuň ýaly eder.
They should be.	Olar bolmaly.
There is something or not.	Bir zat bar ýa-da ýok.
Another time.	Başga bir gezek.
We can't do that.	Biz muny edip bilmeris.
In fact, I have nothing to do with it.	Aslynda meniň etjek zadym ýok.
He could not see me.	Ol meni görüp bilmedi.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
This is not true.	Bu dogry habar däl.
It will be.	Bolar.
This is an interesting idea.	Bu gyzykly pikir.
He told her a few things.	Oňa birnäçe zatlar aýtdy.
They will help you. "	Olar size kömek eder "-diýdi.
He had to do what he had to do.	Etmeli zadyny etmeli boldy.
So everything will be fine.	Şonuň üçin hemme zat gowy bolar.
He is coming to get me.	Ol meni almak üçin gelýär.

If you need more for this.	Munuň üçin has köp zat gerek bolsa.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
He wanted to go.	Ol gitmek isledi.
He could sing.	Ol aýdym aýdyp bilýärdi.

I always do that.	Men elmydama şeýle edýärin.
I advised her to go.	Men oňa gitmegi maslahat berdim.
This is a problem.	Bu kynçylyk.

Two people offered me a job.	Iki adam maňa iş teklip etdi.
He had nothing to do.	Onuň edip biljek zady ýokdy.
I'm sorry, man.	Bagyşlaň, adam.
No one could make me.	Hiç kim meni edip bilmedi.
This is for him.	Bu onuň üçin.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.

"It simply came to our notice then.	"Diýdi.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
I have to.	Men etmeli.
This seems to be a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele ýaly bolup görünýär.
Everything was difficult here.	Bu ýerde hemme zat kyn boldy.
Everyone should do that.	Her kim muny etmeli.
Of course it was.	Elbetde şeýle boldy.
Life is so beautiful.	Durmuş şeýle bir owadan.
This was not very true.	Bu gaty dogry däldi.
There is always such an opportunity.	Elmydama şeýle mümkinçilik bar.
Good, but not necessary.	Gowy, ýöne zerur däl.
So it should be an interesting day.	Şonuň üçin gyzykly gün bolmaly.

They will need you.	Olar size gerek bolar.
I want to go	Men gitmek isleýärin
He said he had.	Ol bardygyny aýtdy.
He gave you.	Ol seni berdi.
The book did not exist before.	Kitap ozal ýokdy.

He said a lot.	Ol gaty köp zat aýtdy.
Maybe very new.	Belki gaty täze.
He helped her.	Ol oňa kömek etdi.
The sound is too loud.	Ses gaty uly.
What's wrong with me? 	Maňa näme bolýar?

You can see what he did to her.	Oňa näme edenini görüp bilersiňiz.

It would be great.	Ajaýyp bolardy.
All stupid, bad.	Hemme samsyk, erbet.

I fully believe that.	Men muňa doly ynanýaryn.
It was his first time there.	Ol ol ýere ilkinji gezek geldi.
It was impossible to answer.	Jogap bermek mümkin däldi.
You have to do something about it. 	Munuň bilen bir zat etmeli. 
A few hours late.	Birnäçe sagat gijä galdy.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.

Not very interesting.	Kän gyzykly däl.

He thought there was something strange about it.	Bu barada geň bir zat bar diýip pikir etdi.
So much fun !!!! 	Gaty hezil !!!!

They both knew the truth.	Ikisi-de hakykaty bilýärdi.

This is really bad.	Hakykatdanam bu erbet.
I'm here for you.	Men seniň üçin şu ýerde.
That didn't help.	Bu kömek edip bilmedi.
What do we really need?	Hakykatdanam bize näme gerek?
If there is anyone there.	Kimdir biri bar bolsa şol ýerde.
You are human.	Sen adam.
There has to be something you can do to help him.	Oňa kömek etmek üçin edip biljek bir zady bolmaly.
He did the same.	Ol hem şeýle etdi.
Does anyone know?	Hiç kim bilýän zady barmy?
Everyone should have a rest.	Her kim dynç almaly.
Not for himself.	Özi üçin däl.
That's right.	Bu dogry zat.
It's too big for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty uly.
You didn't have to be there.	Ol ýerde bolmak hökman däldi.
Not really that bad.	Aslynda beýle erbet däl.
It was really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn boldy.
I don't think that's a bad thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu erbet zat däl.
It was crazy.	Bu däli boldy.
We are here.	Bizi şu ýerde.
It must be very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly bolmaly.
He did not call police.	Ol polisiýa jaň etmedi.
He immediately went with her.	Ol derrew onuň bilen gitdi.
No one told me.	Hiç kim maňa aýtmady.
I can do that	Men muny edip bilerin
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat zat däl.
Stop it!	Muny bes et!
I'm fine with that.	Men munuň bilen gowy boldum.
I think this is the last thing you need.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu iň soňky zerur zat.
He ignored it.	Ol muňa üns bermedi.
Sounds like crazy.	Däli ýaly ses.
Plenty and great.	Köp we ajaýyp.
He could not do anything until then.	Oňa çenli hiç zat edip bilmedi.
Whoever did it is the same.	Ony kim eden bolsa, şol bir zat.
This seems to be true.	Bu dogry ýaly.
I will make you happy	Men seni bagtly ederin.
Such a thing is possible.	Şeýle zat mümkin.
Of course, he didn't have time.	Elbetde, onuň wagty ýokdy.
I am the only one who can do that.	Muny edip biljek ýeke-täk men.
Maybe he can't do anything.	Belki hiç zat edip bilmez.
How I must have stopped it.	Men muny nädip bes eden bolmaly.
I still will.	Men henizem ederin.
So there is no one here.	Şonuň üçin bu ýerde hiç kim ýok.

Of course, he is right.	Elbetde, ol gaty dogry.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle zat däl.
No one but me could do that.	Munuň bilen menden başga hiç kim edip bilmedi.
A few other guys came out.	Başga birnäçe ýigit çykdy.
It was not at all.	Bu düýbünden däldi.
That's what happened.	Ol şeýle boldy.
Do whatever you want	Islän zadyny etmek.
He did not want to.	Islemedi.
This is for today.	Bu şu gün üçin.
That was not enough for him.	Bu onuň üçin ýeterlik däldi.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
He was good to me.	Ol maňa gowy boldy.
I was trying to figure it out.	Özüni pikir ederin diýip pikir etjek boldum.
This is strange for us.	Bu biziň üçin geň.
Many books.	Köp kitap.

Hours later, police also arrested him.	Birnäçe sagat soň polisiýa hem ony tussag etdi.
He called to talk to me.	Ol meniň bilen gürleşmek üçin jaň etdi.

There is no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýok.
No food.	Nahar ýok.
Not now.	Häzir däl.
There was nothing else.	Başga zat ýokdy.
The night is coming.	Gije gelýär.

Two things about this.	Bu hakda iki zat.
Give what you want.	Islän zadyny bermek.
One month, probably.	Bir aý, ähtimal.

Of course he will.	Elbetde eder.

You are really beautiful.	Siz hakykatdanam owadan.
There is no such thing as a good book.	Gowy kitap ýaly zat ýok.

It can't be too serious.	Gaty çynlakaý zat bolup bilmez.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
You don't have to do anything.	Hiç zat etmeli däl.

You can only do this many times.	Muny diňe köp gezek edip bilersiňiz.

You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
Now and then.	Indi we soň.

I have never seen this before.	Bu gün öň hiç wagt görmedim.
I don't think he likes it that much.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny gaty halamaýar.
It was great to see him.	Muny görmek onuň üçin gaty gowy boldy.
Bar.	Bar.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.

Every time something new happened, something more difficult happened.	Her gezek täze bir zat, has kyn zat bardy.
It does.	Muny edýär.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
He didn't even have to say it.	Hatda muny aýtmaly däldi.

Of course he will.	Elbetde, umyt eder.
Maybe it was nothing.	Belki hiç zat däldi.

Time to call for help.	Kömek üçin jaň etmegiň wagty.
I saw.	Men gördüm.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Onuň üçin edip biljek zady ýokdy.
Maybe there's something really wrong here.	Belki, bu ýerde hakykatdanam bir zat bar bolsa gerek.
Maybe one day it will be.	Belki bir gün şeýle bolar.
For the first time	Ilkinji gezek
He's gone now.	Ol indi gitdi.

Often this is not true.	Köplenç bu dogry däl.
In fact, this is not true.	Aslynda bu söz düýbünden dogry däl.
This time it is not.	Bu gezek beýle däl.
An idea came to my mind.	Maňa bir pikir geldi.

I think this will be a great thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy zat bolar.
The sun has risen.	Gün çykdy.
It's really beautiful.	Bu hakykatdanam owadan.
No one can take it.	Hiç kim alyp bilmez.
Good idea, but we can't get it.	Gowy pikir, ýöne biz muny alyp bilmeris.
We will never know.	Biz hiç haçan bilmeris.
It looks great.	Bu gaty gowy görünýär.
This is probably true.	Bu dogry bolsa gerek.
You are really close.	Siz hakykatdanam ýakyn.

Much can be said about this.	Bu hakda köp zat aýdyp bolar.
Two more calls are coming.	Başga iki jaň gelýär.
It was very difficult.	Gaty kyn boldy.
I asked you a question.	Men size bir sorag berdim.
I don’t have a reason for that, but it did.	Mende munuň sebäbi ýok, ýöne şeýle boldy.
No one can go.	Hiç kim gidip bilmez.
He didn't think so.	Ol pikir etmedi.
He did not know how to do it.	Nädip biljekdigini bilmeýärdi.
You know that now.	Muny indi bilýärsiň.

And then he came back.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp geldi.
Of course not at the moment.	Elbetde, häzirki wagtda däl.
There was nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.

Very interesting news.	Gaty gyzykly habar.

Too many people.	Gaty köp adam.

This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.

I am good and happy.	Men gowy we bagtly.
I know that, and you know that.	Men muny bilýärin we sen muny bilýärsiň.
The first two weeks were tough.	Ilkinji iki hepde kyn boldy.

Then came again.	Soň ýene geldi.

This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
They are smart.	Olar akylly.
It was nothing for him.	Bu onuň üçin hiç zat däldi.
You have to get him a message.	Oňa habar almaly.

He has to go now.	Ol indi gitmeli.
That's a lot.	Bu köp boldy.
Probably a lot.	Mümkin köp.

The same person fell asleep.	Şol bir adam uklap galdy.

Then things went crazy.	Soň zatlar däli boldy.
Such a wonderful sound.	Şeýle ajaýyp ses.
This was not possible at all.	Bu düýbünden mümkin däldi.
A lot of things happen.	Köp zatlar bolýar.
I want to take care.	Men alada etmek isleýärin.

One day everything will be really good.	Bir gün hemme zat hakykatdanam gowy bolar.

It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
He asked.	Ol haýyş etdi.
He did it.	Muny etdi.
I really don't like it	Men ony hakykatdanam halamok
Someone wants to get it.	Kimdir biri muny almak isleýär.
No one can really tell.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam aýdyp bilmez.
You just have to get it.	Diňe ony almaly.
Everyone is different.	Her bir adam başga.
This is his last job.	Bu onuň soňky işi.

There was nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde geň zat ýokdy.

Strange things.	Geň zatlar.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
Of course, he didn't say much about me.	Elbetde, ol meniň hakda ol hakda kän zat aýtmady.

Just like before.	Edil öňküsi ýaly.
He decided.	Ol karar berdi.

There is no one else, he just came this morning.	Başga hiç kim ýok, ol diňe şu gün irden geldi.
He just couldn't contain himself.	Diňe özüni alyp bilmedi.

He has to do it.	Ol muny etmeli.
Immediately.	Derrew.
I want to talk about them.	Men olar hakda gürleşmek isleýärin.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.

Last meal.	Iň soňky nahar.
It will not be difficult.	Kyn bolmaz.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I knew nothing about it.	Men bu barada hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
The man knew nothing.	Ol adam hiç zat bilmeýärdi.
This is very difficult for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty kyn.
He could not say.	Ol aýdyp bilmedi.
Of course, this is the way.	Elbetde, bu ýol.
It's also harder to do.	Şeýle hem etmek has kyn.
We have to go together tonight.	Şu gije bilelikde gitmeli.
I want to ask you a question.	Size bir sorag bermek isleýärin.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.

I hope this sounds interesting.	Bu gyzykly ýaly bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
They were no more.	Olar indi beýle däldi.
This is not easy.	Bu beýle aňsat däl.
He didn't pay attention.	Oňa üns bermedi.
His presence was short-lived.	Onuň bolmagy gysga boldy.

She did something beautiful for me.	Ol meniň üçin owadan bir zat etdi.
The smartest of all.	Her ýerde iň akylly.

He already wanted it again.	Ol eýýäm ony ýene isledi.
He took her home.	Öýüne alyp gitdi.
The next best thing.	Indiki iň gowy zat.

He surprised me.	Ol maňa geň galdy.

More for me.	Meniň üçin has köp zat.
Police said it was not.	Polisiýa munuň ýokdugyny aýtdy.
He must have seen it.	Ony gören bolmaly.
No longer a problem.	Indi mesele däl.
Of course not tonight.	Elbetde, bu gije däl.

I don't think it will happen for a while.	Biraz wagt bolar diýip pikir etmeýärin.
I bought it	Men ony satyn aldym
It's been a week night.	Bir hepde gije boldy.
Not really, but it was.	Aslynda beýle däl, ýöne şeýle ýalydy.
I just can't say.	Men diňe aýdyp biljek däl.
He had what he needed.	Oňa zerur zatlar bardy.

He may be alone.	Ol ýeke-täk bolup biler.
Which is stupid because it's there.	Haýsy samsyk, sebäbi şol ýerde.

It was not bad news.	Erbet habar däldi.
And now here it is.	Indi bolsa şu ýerde.

And the big money is too much.	Uly pul bolsa gaty köp.
You can do these things.	Bu zatlary edip bilersiňiz.
No questions asked.	Sorag ýok.
No one wants that!	Hiç kim muny islemeýär!
Ma'am.	Bu.

It was bad.	Erbet hem bardy.
He wanted to see me one last time.	Ol meni soňky gezek görmek isledi.
He ignored it.	Ol muňa üns bermedi.
It was very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat boldy.
It's good to think about something.	Bir zat hakda pikir etmek gowy.
I do it very well.	Men muny gaty gowy edýärin.
Often this is very good.	Köplenç bu gaty gowy.
This is very difficult for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty kyn.
Maybe he knows.	Belki bilýän bolsa gerek.
This is unlikely to happen.	Munuň bolmagy mümkin däl.
He said he would come again tonight.	Ol şu gije ýene geler diýdi.
Just never enough.	Diňe hiç wagt ýeterlik däl.
A few hundred.	Birnäçe ýüz.
This person seems to be in trouble.	Bu adam kynçylyk ýaly görünýär.
He wants to do something.	Ol bir zatlar etmek isleýär.
I got a tip.	Maslahat aldym.
This, of course.	Bu, elbetde.
He was right.	Ol muny dogry aýtdy.

They were not against him.	Olar oňa garşy däldi.
Whatever he did.	Näme eden bolsa.
It can happen many times, only once or never.	Köp gezek bolup biler, diňe bir gezek ýa-da hiç haçan.
I have nothing to give anymore.	Indi bermeli zady ýok.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
He thought I was crazy.	Men däli boldum, diýip pikir etdi.
That would be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolardy.
The day before, it could be a week or a month.	Bir gün öň, bir hepde ýa-da bir aý bolup biler.
Not many people that day.	Şol gün kän bir adam däl.
Not today.	Bu gün däl.

This seems strange to many.	Bu köp adam üçin geň görünýär.
There seemed to be nothing he could do.	Edip biljek zady ýok ýalydy.

Many questions.	Köp sorag.
And now it happens at home.	Indi bolsa, öýde bolýar.

He started it.	Ol muny başlady.
He should never have agreed.	Ol hiç wagt razy bolmaly däldi.
It will take a long time to help.	Kömek bermek üçin köp wagt gerek bolar.
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
He did not have to say anything else.	Oňa başga zat aýtmak hökman däldi.
This is not the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek däl.
For something new and new.	Täze we täze bir zat üçin.

He was not home yet.	Ol henizem öýde däldi.
That's it.	Ol şol.
He did not say anything about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat aýtmady.
It was hard, but it was necessary.	Kyn boldy, ýöne zerur boldy.

I've seen it everywhere.	Men muny hemme ýerde gördüm.
It was not about that.	Bu hakda däldi.
And then he started taking it.	Soň bolsa ony alyp başlady.
In fact, they are.	Aslynda olar.
No one else did much to help.	Başga hiç kim kömek etmek üçin kän bir zat etmedi.
This is not life for you.	Bu siziň üçin durmuş däl.
You don't have to know anything else.	Başga zady bilmek hökman däl.
I will need it	Maňa gerek bolar
Just getting there seems faster.	Diňe ol ýere gitmek has çalt görünýär.
I am busy.	Men meşgul.

For the first time, he understood me.	Ilkinji gezek maňa düşündi.
This is not a good thing.	Bu gowy zat däl.
That's it.	Bu zat.
No one.	Hiç kim ýok.
That's a good question.	Bu gowy sorag.
Looks really good, good, human.	Hakykatdanam gowy, gowy, adam ýaly bolup görünýär.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
He also did not want to.	Şeýle hem, ol islemedi.
There is another possibility.	Başga bir mümkinçilik bar.
Just worry.	Diňe alada etmek.
He gave it to me.	Ol maňa berdi.
You have to be ready.	Siz taýyn bolmaly.
There were several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bardy.
I really did.	Men hakykatdanam etdim.
To be really crazy.	Hakykatdanam däli bolmak.
He was there that day.	Ol şol gün bardy.
He could not help it here.	Bu ýerde oňa kömek edip bilmedi.
Must do.	Hökman etmeli.
Everything is right.	Hemme zat dogry.
I know what he wants.	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärin.
And not so much.	We beýle köp däl.
Tell the truth.	Dogry hakykaty aýdyň.

You are better than me	Sen menden gowy.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
I saw it.	Men muny gördüm.
I think he let me.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol maňa rugsat berdi.
What to do?	Näme etmeli?
It can't be.	Ol bolup bilmez.
More people went to work that year.	Şol ýyl has köp adam işe gitdi.

He may be right.	Dogry aýdyp biler.
There was some money.	Biraz pul bardy.

Just one thing.	Diňe bir zat.
Not just immediately.	Diňe derrew däl.
This is very important.	Bu gaty zerur.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I thought about it a lot.	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim.
Maybe not a good idea.	Belki gowy pikir däl.
He will be the same.	Ol hem şol bolar.
I had to go.	Men gitmeli boldum.
I knew it was going to happen.	Munuň boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
There was nothing else I could do.	Başga edip biljek başga zady ýokdy.
Today is a big day.	Bu gün uly gün.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
Not with a girl.	Gyz bilen däl.
Good.	Gowy.
Therefore	Şonuň üçin
This is worse.	Bu has erbet.
I told her she was OK.	Men onuň erbet däldigini aýtdym.
This should be reported to the police.	Muny polisiýa habar bermeli.
They are one person.	Olar bir adam.
There will be more.	Has köp zat bolar.
He was amazed at this.	Munuň üçin oňa haýran galdy.

Not really that young.	Aslynda beýle ýaş däl.
No one knew much about it.	Hiç kim bu hakda köp zat bilmeýärdi.

You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe bir zat etmeli.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.

These things are very bad.	Bu zatlar gaty erbet.
No worries.	Alada ýokdy.
Everything is fine now.	Häzir hemme zat gowy.
He wanted to go home.	Öýüne gitmek isledi.
This can never be enough.	Bu hiç haçan ýeterlik bolup bilmez.
This is not with me.	Munuň özi meniň bilen däl.
He gave us everything.	Ol bize bar zady berdi.
This seems very strange to me.	Bu maňa gaty geň görünýär.
New life is always coming later.	Täze durmuş hemişe soň gelýär.
He does just that.	Diňe şeýle edýär.
Men.	Men.
It will be really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy bolar.
I did not have.	Mende ýokdy.
I want to help you.	Size kömek etmek isleýärin.
It was great.	Ajaýyp boldy.
It was really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy boldy.
He was here last night.	Ol düýn agşam şu ýerde.

There was something else about him.	Ol hakda başga zat bardy.
That was great.	Munuň özi gaty gowy boldy.

I think that could be the problem.	Meniň pikirimçe, munuň üçin mesele bolup biler.
I didn't know what it was like.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilmedim.
He could not call her.	Ol oňa jaň edip bilmedi.
What to do if there is no tomorrow?	Ertir ýok bolsa näme etmeli?
Now you know.	Indi bilýärsiň.
For better or worse.	Gowy ýa-da erbet üçin.
I thought about it too.	Men bu hakda hem pikir etdim.

There was no problem.	Kynçylyk ýokdy.
You don't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däl.
I hope this is not you.	Bu sen däl diýip umyt edýärin.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
It didn't seem right.	Bu dogry däl ýalydy.
I did that last year.	Men muny geçen ýyl etdim.
This is not a problem.	Bu bir kynçylyk däl.
This is bad for you.	Bu siziň üçin erbet.
He has to be somewhere.	Ol şu ýerde bir ýerde bolmaly.
I would have.	Mende bolardy.
I hope it will be sooner.	Has ir bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
I didn’t know it would.	Munuň etjekdigini bilmeýärdim.
It's hard, isn't it?	Bu gaty kyn, şeýlemi?
I was happy.	Men bagtly boldum.
She is a girl.	Ol bir gyz.
No words.	Söz ýok.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
And many.	We köp.
I am happy.	Men bagtly.

Too many.	Gaty köp.
He said a lot.	Ol köp zat diýdi.
I don't want that anymore.	Indi muny islämok.
There was a large police force.	Uly polisiýa bardy.
Maybe so now.	Belki, häzir şeýle.
This is a big deal.	Bu uly mesele.
I'll have to do something.	Men bir zat etmeli bolaryn.
I did not know	Men bilmedim
Not available at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda ýok.
He is absolutely right.	Ol düýbünden dogry.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He didn't know it was going to happen.	Ol munuň etmeli bir zat boljakdygyny bilmeýärdi.
Of course you are.	Elbetde özüňiz.
Okay.	Bolýar.
This is a complete lie.	Bu düýbünden ýalan.
In short.	Gysga.
He still didn't think about it.	Ol henizem oňa pikir etmedi.
This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
With a man.	Bir adam bilen.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
He will do so.	Ol şeýle eder.
Of course I can't tell you that.	Elbetde, muny size aýdyp biljek däl.
He can behave.	Özüni alyp biler.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
We can do nothing.	Biz hiç zat edip bilmeris.
This is very complete.	Bu gaty doly.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu dogry däl.
I knew it.	Men muny gowy bilýärdim.
I don’t know why she cares so much about a girl.	Näme üçin bu bir gyz hakda beýle alada edýändigini bilemok.
This is another possibility.	Bu başga bir mümkinçilik.
Now it's time to dump her and move on.	Indi söz çykdy.
Tomorrow, of course, tomorrow.	Ertir, elbetde, ertir.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
There will be enough opportunity for that.	Munuň üçin ýeterlik mümkinçilik bolar.
What is this 	Bu näme?
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Someone like you	Kimdir biri seniň ýaly
The problem is, someone did it.	Mesele, kimdir biri etdi.
With them	Olar bilen.
Things get interesting here.	Bu ýerde zatlar gyzykly bolýar.
Maybe it shouldn't be money.	Belki pul bolmaly däl.
She had to go home.	Öýüne gitmeli boldy.
This is great news!	bu gaty gowy habar!
I didn't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däldim.

He is no better.	Ol mundan gowy däl.
Why do it?	Näme üçin etmeli?
This was not a mistake.	Bu hiç hili ýalňyşlyk däldi.
Is this really the case?	Bu hakykatdanam şeýlemi?
Good.	Gowy.
In fact, once upon a time there was only one guy.	Aslynda, bir gezek diňe bir ýigit.
And then he came back.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp geldi.
Of course he couldn't.	Elbetde, edip bilmedi.

I really can't say.	Men hakykatdanam aýdyp bilemok.
Police arrested him.	Polisiýa ony tussag etdi.
I don't have to do anything.	Men bir zat etmeli däl.
You have to lend it to him for that.	Munuň üçin oňa karz bermeli.
You are there for me	Sen meniň üçin bar
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
This is what happens.	Bu şeýle bolýar.
This is a wonderful day.	Bu ajaýyp gün.
It's beautiful, isn't it?	Bu owadan, şeýlemi?
In fact, it is impossible to do so.	Aslynda muny etmek mümkin däl.
He said.	Ol şeýle diýdi.
This is a big mistake.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk.
He lives alone.	Ol ýeke ýaşaýar.
And so it is.	Bu hem şeýle.
Everything seemed very difficult.	Hemme zat gaty kyn ýalydy.
That should be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolmaly.
Then he rested for two months and two months.	Soň bolsa iki aý we iki aý dynç aldy.
You are bad!	Sen erbet!
You have no other answer.	Size başga jogap ýok.
We are not against it.	Biz muňa garşy däl.
I'm worried.	Men alada edýärin.
No one ever knows.	Hiç haçan hiç kim bilenok.
He doesn't want to take it anymore.	Mundan beýläk almak islemeýär.
Not necessarily new.	Hökman täze zatlar däl.
It may be necessary.	Zerur bolup biler.
It just looks stupid.	Diňe samsyk ýaly görünýär.
It doesn't look like much.	Bu gaty uzak ýaly däl.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
Everything that happens will happen twice.	Bolýan hemme zat iki gezek bolar.
He rested.	Ol dynç aldy.
I said that.	Men muny aýtdym.
There was no other way.	Indi başga ýol ýokdy.
We are.	Biz.
He did not.	Beýle etmedi.
How can I go about it?	Bu barada nädip gidip bilerin?
This is also a lie.	Bu hem ýalan.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Diňe hiç zat ýok.
"It's impossible," he said.	Ol "mümkin däl" diýdi.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
Who is he	Ol kim.
Good, but the same.	Gowy, ýöne şol bir.
Almost everyone does.	Hemmeler diýen ýaly edýär.
There is a girl.	Bir gyz bar.
Because it will be so.	Sebäbi şeýle bolar.
If possible, tonight.	Mümkin bolsa, şu gije.
Of course, he doesn't want to be anything at the moment.	Elbetde, ol şol wagt hiç zat bolmak islemeýär.
Nothing new here.	Bu ýerde täze zat däl.
Now he's gone too.	Indi ol hem gitdi.
He was almost there.	Ol diýen ýalydy.
It didn't have to be that way.	Munuň ýaly bolmaly däldi.
You can see that.	Muny görüp bilersiňiz.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu uly zat.
I had to give him the right time.	Men oňa dogry wagt bermeli boldum.
So that could be a better thing.	Şonuň üçin bu has gowy zat bolup biler.
Such a day will come.	Şeýle gün geler.
One every day.	Her gün biri.
This is a very difficult decision.	Bu gaty bir karar.
It seemed like it hadn't been there for a long time.	Uzak wagt bäri ýok ýalydy.
A lot has happened.	Köp zat boldy.
Because he is.	Sebäbi ol.
You don’t have to worry about them to see that.	Muny görmek üçin olar hakda alada etmeli däl.
That was no longer the case.	Bu indi dogry däldi.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
I don’t know, not really.	Bilmedim, aslynda däl.
He really did exist.	Ol hakykatdanam bardy.
They are very good.	Olar gaty gowy.
It could be something.	Ol bir zat bolup biler.
It could be help.	Kömek bolup biler.
That makes me right now.	Bu meni häzir edýär.
He told me everything.	Ol maňa hemme zady habar berdi.
No one can say what to do.	Hiç kim näme etmelidigini aýdyp bilmez.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, iň soňky isleýän zady.
We need someone else.	Bize başga biri gerek.

He said something else.	Ol başga bir zat diýdi.
To worry.	Alada etmek üçin.
This is a great opportunity.	Bu ajaýyp mümkinçilik.
You are the best thing that ever happened to me.	Sen meniň bilen bolup geçen iň gowy zat.
I know now.	Men häzir bilerin.
Strange idea.	Geň pikir.
He called.	Ol jaň etdi.
Of course, there was one.	Elbetde, biri bardy.
That's very beautiful.	Ine, gaty owadan.
There was a loud noise.	Gaty ses çykdy.
I want to	Men isleýärin
He was not human.	Ol adam däldi.
For good news.	Gowy habar üçin.
Good now	Häzir gowy.
This is not for nothing.	Bu hiç zat üçin däl.
This can be difficult.	Bu kyn bolmagy mümkin.
And then one day it happened.	Soň bolsa bir gün şeýle boldy.
It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
I have an idea.	Mende bir pikir bar.
He took several others.	Birnäçe başga birini aldy.
Once and only once he was here.	Bir gezek we diňe bir gezek ol şu ýerde boldy.
Really the other way around.	Hakykatdanam, başga ýol.
He knows that too.	Muny hem bilýär.
He stayed home all day.	Ol bütin gün öýde galdy.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Saňa aýtmak islemedim.
That must be true.	Bu dogry bolmaly.
Of course I didn't.	Elbetde etmedim.
It doesn't seem to be.	Beýle däl ýaly.
There should be a lot.	Köp bolmaly.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu dogry bolup bilmez.
Of course, it wasn't that bad.	Elbetde, beýle erbet däldi.
It may be very interesting, but it is not for everyone.	Bu gaty gyzykly bolup biler, ýöne bu hemmeler üçin däl.
I can never talk about it.	Men bu hakda hiç wagt gürläp bilemok.
, we.	, we.
He will do it once and twice for himself.	Ony özi üçin bir gezek we iki gezek eder.
It was just like that.	Diňe bir ýalydy.
Good.	Gowy.
The help is great	Kömek gaty gowy
It looks stupid.	Bu samsyk ýaly görünýär.
Okay.	Bolýar.
When did he come	Ol haçan geldi?
He still has to call.	Ol henizem jaň etmeli.
We can't do these things right now.	Häzirki wagtda bu zatlary hem edip bilmeris.
He did.	Ol şeýle etdi.
I can only speak for myself.	Men diňe özüm üçin gürläp bilerin.
There was only one.	Diňe bardy.
The pleasure is gone.	Lezzet gitdi.
He has been there twice.	Ol ol ýerde iki gezek boldy.
This is great!	Bu ajaýyp!
The only thing was that he didn't want to go.	Diňe bir zat, ol gitmek islemedi.
What do you think?	Siziň pikiriňizçe näme?
Good.	Gowy.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
Not a bad thing.	Erbet iş däl.
He wanted to talk to me.	Meni gürleşmek isledi.
I'll do it in the morning.	Men muny irden ederin.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
She was worried.	Ol alada galdy.
I fully believe that.	Men muňa doly ynanýaryn.
It turned out really well	Hakykatdanam gowy çykdy
Who did that?	Muny kim etdi?
I'll call you tomorrow.	Ertir size jaň ederin.
Not the right time.	Dogry wagt däl.
I'm sorry for you.	Seniň üçin gynanýaryn.
Bad.	Erbet.
That was not the case.	Munuň özi beýle däldi.
No one knew why this happened.	Munuň näme üçin bolandygyny hiç kim bilmedi.
It's not easy to do.	Etmek aňsat däl.
He had to go there.	Ol şol ýere gitmeli boldy.
I have never seen anything like it.	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim.
That's how bad they are.	Ine, olar nähili erbet.
It's just weird.	Bu diňe geň.
This will never happen.	Bu hiç haçan bolmaz.
What can you think?	Näme pikir edip bilersiňiz.
He told me to do it.	Ol maňa etmelidigini aýtdy.
It makes it more interesting.	Bu has gyzykly edýär.
Actually no, no.	Aslynda ýok, ýok.
I can't say how it happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny aýdyp bilemok.
Quick and fresh request.	Çalt we täze haýyş.
He did not promise.	Ol söz bermedi.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty ajaýyp.
Two hours from now.	Mundan beýläk iki sagat.
I have to say he has it.	Oňa bardygyny aýtmaly.
It's too early to tell.	Şu wagt aýtmak gaty ir.
This is a very good book.	Bu gaty gowy kitap.
You don't have to think badly of anything.	Hiç zat hakda erbet pikir etmeli däl.
I can't do anything	Hiç zat edip bilemok
I just have to tell you.	Men diňe size aýtmaly.
That's the way it is today.	Bu gün şeýle boldy.
You are no one	Sen hiç kim däl
This is my last.	Bu meniň iň soňky.
It looks good on me.	Bu maňa gowy görünýär.
These are really great things.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp zatlar.
I didn't even know it.	Hatda muny bilmeýärdim.
Not a good answer.	Gowy jogap däl.
Everyone.	Hemmeler.
Saying something, but not really saying it.	Bir zatlar aýtmak, ýöne hakykatdanam aýtmak däl.
She was home alone, so there was no problem.	Ol ýeke öýde, şonuň üçin hiç hili mesele ýokdy.
Someone has to buy it.	Kimdir biri ony satyn almaly bolýar.
I am still young	Men henizem ýaş.
It was never beautiful.	Hiç haçan owadan däldi.
I think it was great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy boldy.
Nothing was wrong.	Hiç zat mesele däldi.
It was great to see her last night.	Düýn agşam ony görmek gaty gowy boldy.
Someone who can vote.	Ses berip biljek biri.
It looks better.	Has gowy görünýär.
He can't do that.	Ol muny edip bilmeýär.
He does this for you.	Ol siziň üçin bu işi edýär.
I heard that.	Men muny eşitdim.
I had to tell you.	Men saňa aýtmaly boldum.
A little good.	Biraz gowy.
It took a long time.	Bu köp wagt aldy.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Beýle etjek hiç zat ýok.
Which is strange.	Haýsy geň.
This is a great hope.	Bu uly umyt.
He went and did it now.	Ol gidip, indi etdi.
Of course not.	Elbetde, ýok.
Everything should be fine now.	Häzir hemme zat gowy bolmaly.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
You know	Bilýärsiň.
The two are always together.	Ikisi hemişe bile.
Someone had to help there.	Biri ol ýerde kömek etmeli boldy.
There is something easier, of course.	Elbetde has aňsat bir zat bar.
This meal was just good.	Bu nahar diňe gowy boldy.
He did not want to see it.	Ol muny görmek islemedi.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
I really don't know	Men hakykatdanam bilemok
It can be good and bad.	Bu gowy we erbet bolup biler.
No need.	Gerek däl.
There seems to be nothing.	Bir zat ýok ýaly.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu beýle däl ýaly.
In a word.	Söz bilen.
The day was not enough.	Gün ýeterlik däldi.
I have nothing to worry about.	Alada etjek zadym ýok.
I really tried.	Men hakykatdanam synap gördüm.
Now tell the truth.	Indi hakykaty aýdyň.
I know one thing.	Men bir zady bilýärin.
Tell me this.	Muny maňa aýdyň.
Not with me, but with him.	Meniň bilen däl, onuň bilen.
Not here.	Bu ýerde däl.
You are nothing to me.	Sen meniň üçin hiç zat däl.
In fact, no one was there.	Aslynda hiç kim ýokdy.
He was not ready for it.	Ol muňa düýbünden taýyn däldi.
I found it difficult.	Men muny kyn gördüm.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
I have to take care of myself.	Özüm hakda alada etmeli.
Not much.	Kän däldi.
No answer!	Jogap ýok!
Of course, they are not.	Elbetde, olar bir zat däl.
He could not get it.	Ol muny alyp bilmedi.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Munuň ýaly bolmaly däl.
I really need it.	Maňa gaty gerek.
We need more money.	Bize has köp pul gerek.
Like the police now.	Häzirki wagtda polisiýa ýaly.
He wants to know what happened to me.	Maňa näme bolandygyny bilmek isleýär.
He just thought of himself.	Ol diňe özüni pikir etdi.
I was completely rested.	Men doly dynç aldym.
Of course he did that to me.	Elbetde, maňa şeýle etdi.
Another way.	Başga ýol.
Like.	Ýaly .
This statement is incorrect.	Bu söz dogry däl.
He just gave bad advice.	Ol diňe erbet maslahat berdi.
He destroyed.	Ol ýok etdi.
I know this a lot.	Men muny köp bilýärin.
Tomorrow.	Ertir.
He had to decide for himself.	Ol özüne karar bermeli boldy.
He said he was ready for you.	Ol size taýyn diýdi.
Of course, he was not there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde ýokdy.
He did not allow it.	Ol oňa rugsat bermedi.
He knew what to do.	Näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
I hoped it would be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt etdim.
The night is fast approaching.	Gije çalt gelýär.
You are not them and they are not you.	Sen olar däl we olar sen däl.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
I want to be very bad there.	Men ol ýerde gaty erbet bolmak isleýärin.
I can't sleep	Men uklap bilemok
Who knows what might happen.	Näme bolup biljekdigini kim bilýär.
I have done this many times.	Men muny köp gezek etdim.
He does just that.	Diňe şeýle edýär.
I don't think we should go?	Biz gitmeli öýdemok?
They came now.	Olar indi.
.	.
In fact, it has been a while.	Aslynda birneme wagt boldy.
The time was not right.	Wagt dogry däldi.
This is not easy.	Bu beýle aňsat däl.
He actually wanted to know.	Aslynda bilmek isledi.
Great too.	Uly hem.
There is a weekend.	Dynç güni bar.
No one paid much attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa kän bir üns bermedi.
There is no answer to that.	Oňa jogap ýok.
Not worth buying.	Satyn almaly däl.
He never said that.	Ol muny hiç haçan aýtmady.
One night	Bir gije.
I think they are good.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar gowy.
He knows that something is wrong.	Bir zadyň gaty dogry däldigini bilýär.
I want nothing more than you.	Men senden başga zat islämok.
Oh! 	Aý!
This is not his business.	Bu onuň işi däl.
And you are absolutely right.	Siz bolsa düýbünden dogry.
Not true.	Dogry däl.
Good news.	Gowy habar.
Couldn't be long.	Uzak bolup bilmedi.
It works well.	Gowy iş edýär.
It would be for that.	Munuň üçin bolardy.
I don't want to do that.	Men muny etmek islämok.
Police arrived an hour earlier.	Polisiýa bir sagat öň geldi.
It was as if he just wanted to talk to me.	Ol diňe meniň bilen gürleşmek isleýän ýalydy.
Now everyone is happy.	Indi hemmeler bagtly.
I tried to call.	Jaň etjek boldum.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
Not much.	Köp däl.
He knows a lot.	Ol köp zady bilýär.
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
He answered that.	Ol muňa jogap berdi.
Also.	Şeýle hem.
This is the next thing.	Bu indiki iş.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe mesele.
He is not here and will not harm you.	Ol bu ýerde däl we size zyýan berip bilmez.
He would be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolardy.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
You have to do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly etmeli.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
About him.	Ol hakda.
Of course he is.	Elbetde, ol hem.
Of course he can.	Elbetde edip biler.
You or anyone else.	Siz ýa-da başga hiç kim.
He really didn't.	Ol hakykatdanam etmedi.
Here I am.	Ine, meniň bilen.
One word for that.	Munuň üçin ýekeje söz.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
He is still here.	Ol henizem şu ýerde.
I never thought he would do that.	Onuň beýle zat etjekdigini hiç wagt pikir etmedim.
I didn't even know it existed.	Hatda henizem bardygyny bilmeýärdim.
Of course this is possible.	Elbetde bu mümkin.
I need advice.	Maňa maslahat gerek.
Who knows where it will be next week.	Geljek hepde nirede boljakdygyny kim bilýär.
Nothing happened.	Hiç zat ýokdy.
Nothing else.	Başga zat ýok.
He was already there.	Ol öňem bardy.
I became such a person.	Men şeýle adam boldum.
And now it's back.	Indi bolsa ýene geldi.
I look really crazy.	Men hakykatdanam däli ýaly.
A lot of things would be great.	Köp zat ajaýyp bolardy.
More than me.	Menden başga, has köp zat.
That's the way it is	Edil şonuň ýaly
Okay, maybe just a job.	Bolýar, belki diňe bir iş.
Anyone can.	Her kim edip biler.
Anyway, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Näme bolsa, şu ýerde bolaryn.
And then he did another one.	Soň bolsa başga birini etdi.
That could be great.	Bu uly bolup biler.
Just tell us this and that.	Diňe bize muny we.
He did not do this to anyone else.	Ol muny başga hiç kime etmedi.
Not a bad idea.	Erbet pikir däl.
There is no other option.	Başga mümkinçilik ýok.
There was a man.	Bir adam bardy.
There is no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýok.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
I hope it will be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
Today is the best day.	Bu gün iň gowy gün.
He didn't help much.	Ol kän bir kömek etmedi.
Something really bad.	Hakykatdanam erbet bir zat.
It's really beautiful.	Aslynda gaty owadan.
The moon is very good.	Aý gaty gowy.
And now you.	Indi bolsa sen.
That never happened.	Munuň özi hiç wagt ýokdy.
This road is very difficult.	Bu ýol gaty kyn.
Just so hard.	Edil gaty kyn.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Şeýle hem bolmaly däl.
I had a word.	Mende bir söz bardy.
He did it.	Muny etdi.
I got a few things from you.	Men senden birnäçe zat aldym.
There may be one or more reasons for this.	Munuň bir ýa-da birnäçe sebäbi bolup biler.
Nor is it true.	Şeýle hem, dogry däl.
That's right.	Gaty dogry.
I couldn't sleep.	Men uklap bilmedim.
She is very smart.	Ol gaty akylly.
I don't like myself	Men özümi halamok
Now you have to make two decisions.	Indi iki karar bermeli.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
I don't know anything about you	Men sen hakda hiç zat bilemok
Almost by the way.	Uly ýol bilen diýen ýaly.
Today was a wonderful day.	Bu gün ajaýyp gün boldy.
Nor was this true.	Şeýle hem bu dogry däldi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Gitmeli wagt geldi.
Now I have a new girl	Indi täze gyz aldym
Very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly.
It could be good with you.	Bu siziň bilen gowy bolup biler.
There is no problem there.	Ol ýerde kynçylyk ýok.
Because it's bigger than me.	Sebäbi bu menden uly.
I've seen more.	Men has köp zady gördüm.
I hope so.	Bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
He doesn’t think about anything other than work.	Işden başga zat hakda pikir etmeýär.
possible	mümkin.
A year ago.	Bir ýyl ozal.
I was nothing and no one.	Men hiç zat we hiç kim däldim.
He did not want to give.	Ol bermek islemedi.
You need help.	Size kömek gerek.
In fact, there is no other way.	Aslynda indi başga ýol ýok.
Who lives in that house?	Şol öýde kim ýaşaýar?
I'm not that.	Men ol däl.
It's mine, but.	Bu meniň, ýöne.
For many people.	Köp adam üçin.
I think this is everywhere.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hemme ýerde.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
That was not the question.	Bu sorag däldi.
He doesn't care about anything.	Hiç zat hakda alada etmeýär.
Now there is one.	Indi biri bar.
It won't happen again.	Indiki bolmaz.
Time is hard.	Wagt kyn.
Here or somewhere nearby.	Bu ýerde ýa-da ýakyn bir ýerde.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp gowy görünýär.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
It's over.	Bu indi.
There are many books here.	Bu ýerde köp kitap bar.
He didn't do that!	Ol muny etmedi!
It's closer.	Bu has ýakyn.
He thought he was something.	Ol özüni bir zat diýip pikir etdi.
The future is not an opportunity.	Geljek, mümkinçilik däl.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
Good job	Gowy iş.
Of course, he had to go.	Elbetde, ol gitmeli boldy.
He didn't do very well.	Ol gaty gowy iş etmedi.
We are together all day.	Biz bütin gün bile.
No one did it to him.	Oňa hiç kim muny etmedi.
Here's what happened.	Ine, näme boldy.
He doesn't have much.	Oňa kän zat ýok.
I had to do something.	Men bir hili etmeli boldum.
There is something else here.	Bu ýerde başga bir zat bar.
One thing for sure.	Elbetde bir zat.
At the moment.	Häzirki wagtda.
Maybe a good thing.	Belki gowy zat.
Probably too many times.	Mümkin gaty köp gezek.
It didn’t seem so bad.	Bu beýle erbet däl ýalydy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu sorag bolsa.
This seems impossible.	Bu mümkin däl ýaly.
That shouldn't be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däl.
Everyone has to go.	Her kim gitmeli.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I need it fast.	Maňa çalt gerek.
He knew how to do it.	Ol muny nädip etmelidigini bilýärdi.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Hakykatdanam, ol hem şeýle boldy.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
I think that's a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
This is really strange.	Bu hakykatdanam geň görünýär.
It was not a problem.	Kynçylyk däldi.
That alone was not enough.	Diňe ýeterlik däldi.
Indeed, there is.	Hakykatdanam, bar.
They are not.	Olar däl.
What can he do?	Näme edip biler.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
She started going.	Ol gidip başlady.
He can't do that.	Ol muny edip bilmeýär.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
It looks very good there, bad.	Ol ýerde gaty gowy görünýär, erbet.
Now there is a question about that.	Indi bu barada sorag bar.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I did not know	Men bilmedim
You can do that.	Muny edip bilersiňiz.
There is no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýok.
Oh, no, not tonight.	Aý, ýok, bu gije däl.
This may be the first.	Bu ilkinji bolup biler.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
She is so beautiful.	Ol şeýle bir owadan.
The problem is not new.	Kynçylyk täze habar däl.
It was a great night.	Bu gije gaty hezil boldy.
You are crazy	Sen däli.
Which is correct?	Haýsy dogry?
It was not this morning.	Bu gün irden ýokdy.
These are two questions.	Bu iki sorag.
In fact, it has nothing to do with it.	Hakykatdanam, oňa hiç zat ýok.
It doesn't seem like much right now.	Şu wagt gaty gerek däl ýaly.
Definitely happy about that.	Elbetde, bu barada bagtly.
A lot of work.	Köp iş.
There is no one but me.	Menden başga hiç kim ýok.
It's not just about money.	Bu diňe pul hakda däl.
It made me feel good	Meni gowy etdi
It's just coming.	Diňe gelýär.
He will never agree!	Ol hiç haçan razy bolmaz!
She is always so happy.	Ol elmydama şeýle bagtly.
When did it happen	Haçan boldy.
Who does it.	Ony kim edýär.
I believe it is possible.	Mümkin bolup biljekdigine ynanýaryn.
The job is to take care of that.	Iş bu barada alada etmeli.
Now it’s not just an idea.	Indi bu diňe pikir däl.
It shouldn't be here	Bu ýerde bolmaly däl
They are.	Olar.
That is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle bolmaly däl.
I think this is a decision, a decision.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu karar, karar.
You don't have to know now.	Häzir bilmek hökman däl.
They can be both.	Ikisi hem bolup biler.
He needs someone like you.	Oňa seniň ýaly biri gerek.
No one said that.	Hiç kim muny aýtmady.
He is always thinking of new things.	Elmydama täze zatlar hakda pikir edýär.
It can't be good.	Gowy bolup bilmez.
It's not just about you and what you want.	Diňe sen hakda we isleýän zadyň hakda däl.
How is this possible?	Bu nädip mümkin?
What a bad idea.	Nähili erbet pikir.
We can go	Biz gidip bileris
Someone else, of course.	Elbetde, başga biri.
I thought about it a lot.	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim.
The man is gone.	Ol adam gitdi.
He was not young, but short.	Ol ýaş däldi, ýöne gysga.
So the time is short.	Şonuň üçin wagt gysga.
I want it badly.	Men muny erbet isleýärin.
There is no way, no way.	Diňe ýol ýok, ýol ýok.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
I need someone	Maňa kimdir biri gerek
That would always be the case, both.	Elmydama şeýle bolardy, ikisi.
It took the most time to get it.	Muny almak üçin iň köp wagt gerek boldy.
That's right.	Dogry.
There is so much to worry about now.	Häzir sizi biynjalyk etmek üçin gaty köp.
Of course, he doesn't know.	Elbetde, özi bilenok.
He never said what he would do.	Ol näme etjekdigini hiç wagt aýtmady.
This allowed us.	Bu bize mümkinçilik berdi.
Talk to him.	Onuň bilen gürleşmek.
I think this is it.	Meniň pikirimçe, şu.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
There is nothing better to do.	Etmek üçin has gowy zat ýok.
This is not beautiful.	Bu owadan däl.
This is a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý mesele.
We have to go there.	Biz ol ýere gitmeli.
He was arrested.	Ony tussag etdi.
I am happy.	Men bagtly.
You will be happier.	Siz has bagtly bolarsyňyz.
This is a very difficult decision.	Bu gaty kyn karar.
We ol.	We ol.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
Never.	Hiç haçan.
Maybe more.	Belki has köp bolmagy mümkin.
The strangest thing happened yesterday.	Iň geň zat düýn boldy.
He wanted a lot.	Köp zady isledi.
Next.	Indiki.
I hope it helps.	Kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
He did it now.	Ol muny indi etdi.
I knew it well enough.	Men ony ýeterlik bilýärdim.
You can get it easier.	Muny has aňsat alyp bilersiňiz.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He knew these things.	Bu zatlary bilýärdi.
I didn't see it that way.	Men ony beýle görmedim.
I didn't do that to hurt anyone.	Men muny hiç kime zyýan bermek üçin etmedim.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I do it at home.	Men muny öýde edýärin.
He should never have been an adult.	Ol hiç wagt uly adam bolmaly däldi.
Of course not.	Elbetde men däl.
Of course, there is work to be done.	Elbetde, iş hem bar.
This is a question.	Bu sorag.
This is difficult, but not impossible.	Bu kyn, ýöne mümkin däl.
Of course.	Elbetde.
The bad news came last month.	Erbet habar geçen aý geldi.
It's just like now.	Bu edil häzirki ýaly.
We are ready for that.	Biz muňa taýyn.
Okay, so maybe not everyone.	Bolýar, şonuň üçin hemmeler ýaly däl bolmagy mümkin.
A lot of things.	Köp zat.
Oh, that's bad.	Aý, bu erbet.
I need help.	Maňa kömek etmeli.
It doesn't have to be you or me anymore.	Indi sen ýa-da men bolmaly däl.
In fact, it may be the only one.	Aslynda, ýeke-täk bolmagy mümkin.
In fact, it was.	Aslynda, şeýle boldy.
He didn’t think about the possibility.	Mümkinçilik hakda pikir etmedi.
It had to do him the most damage.	Bu oňa iň köp zyýan bermeli boldy.
Maybe no one knows.	Belki hiç kim bilmez.
At that time.	Şol wagt.
He had to decide.	Ol karar bermeli boldy.
Of course there is.	Elbetde, bar.
It may even take two or three weeks, or a month.	Hatda iki ýa-da üç hepde, ýa-da bir aý gerek bolup biler.
I can't borrow anything for that idea.	Bu pikir üçin hiç hili karz alyp bilemok.
Now there is a problem.	Indi bir mesele bar.
He does not do any of this.	Ol munuň hiç birini etmeýär.
Better now.	Häzir has gowy.
No time now.	Indi wagt ýok.
I think that's right.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry zat.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
No need.	Gerek däl.
Only so.	Diňe şeýle.
There is no question about that.	Bu hakda sorag ýok.
That could be a problem.	Bu bir mesele bolup biler.
They are more interesting.	Olar has gyzykly.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
He couldn't tell her, he couldn't see her.	Ol oňa aýdyp bilmedi, ony görüp bilmedi.
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu dogry däl.
I need it	Maňa gerek
That year.	Şol ýyl.
Because there was nothing to do.	Sebäbi etmeli hiç zat ýokdy.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
Something you can do.	Bir zat edip biljek bir zady.
I don't know how he did it.	Men muny nädip edendigini bilemok.
It is very, very fast and not very beautiful.	Bu gaty, çalt we gaty owadan däl.
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.	Erbet däldi, ýöne beýle hem gowy däldi.
I don't know what.	Men näme bilemok.
The easy answer is two.	Aňsat jogap ikisi.
This can be really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet bolup biler.
Of course it is possible.	Elbetde mümkin.
There must be something good out there.	Ol ýerde gowy zatlar bar bolsa gerek.
This is a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý iş.
I have to be good.	Men gowy bolmaly.
That's all.	Diňe şu.
We just need more.	Bize diňe köp zat gerek.
It's just that.	Bu diňe.
he asked.	diýip sorady.
The moon is very interesting.	Aý gaty gyzykly.
We are not like you.	Biz seniň ýaly däl.
Tell me what happened.	Näme bolandygyny aýdyň.
Have fun once.	Bir gezek hezil etmeli.
I stayed there one night.	Men ol ýerde bir gije bir gije boldum.
You know that can't happen.	Munuň bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärsiň.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
He apologized for the inconvenience.	Munuň üçin ötünç sorady.
He started to bother me.	Ol meni biynjalyk edip başlady.
They are no more.	Olar indi ýok.
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Something or someone.	Bir zat ýa-da kimdir biri.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Munuň özi gaty gyzykly bolmaz.
That's it.	Ine, şol ýerde.
There is no one to help me.	Maňa kömek etjek adam ýok.
I care a lot.	Men gaty köp alada edýärin.
It would be harder.	Bu has kyn bolardy.
I can go with that.	Men munuň bilen gidip bilerin.
This made him anxious.	Bu bolsa ony biynjalyk etdi.
It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
We must have done better.	Biz has gowy eden bolmaly.
In fact, it can be very difficult.	Aslynda, gaty kyn bolup biler.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
Even.	Hatda.
The girl is very beautiful.	Gyz gaty owadan.
There.	Ol ýerde.
This is smarter than you.	Bu senden akylly.
He couldn't even answer.	Ol hatda jogap berip bilmedi.
Now or never.	Indi ýa-da hiç haçan.
This path is easier.	Bu ýol has aňsat.
Me	Ine
In fact, no one can do that.	Aslynda hiç kim edip bilmez.
The only reason for this is.	Munuň ýeke-täk sebäbi.
This was not a big deal.	Bu kän bir mesele däldi.
I'm stupid	Men samsyk.
Only if you need money.	Diňe pul gerek bolsa.
We can be here.	Biz şu ýerde bolup bileris.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
It is also large.	Ol hem uly.
This is a great idea.	Bu ajaýyp pikir.
Seems like a lot of money.	Köp pul ýaly bolup görünýär.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
He is just.	Ol diňe.
And then there you are.	Soň bolsa sen bar.
He didn't have to do that.	Ol beýle etmeli däldi.
Now is the time.	Indi wagt geldi.
In fact, he could not do anything about it.	Hakykatdanam, bu hakda başga hiç zat edip bilmedi.
Because it happened.	Sebäbi şeýle boldy.
The reason for this is huge.	Munuň sebäbi gaty uly.
That word sounds weird.	Bu söz bir hili geň görünýär.
I was no more.	Indi men ýokdy.
It's very close.	Bu gaty ýakyn.
They really are.	Hakykatdanam olar.
I know things.	Men zatlary bilýärin.
No one really knows much about it.	Hiç kim bu hakda hakykatdanam köp zat bilmeýär.
Life was never like that.	Durmuş hiç wagt beýle däldi.
He knows that.	Muny bilýär.
He said he could not sleep.	Ol uklap bilmedi diýdi.
He gave me life.	Ol maňa durmuş berdi.
The worst part is.	Iň erbet zat.
We must.	Biz hökman etmeli.
So the problem is.	Şonuň üçin kynçylyk şu.
No more news.	Indi bu habar ýok.
In fact, this is not the case.	Aslynda bu dogry däldi.
We are there.	Biz şol ýerde.
I will do what is necessary to make this happen.	Munuň bolmagy üçin zerur zatlary ederin.
It just caused a lot of work.	Diňe köp işe sebäp boldy.
There is no one better than me.	Menden has gowy adam ýok.
Everywhere.	Hemme ýerde.
I am human.	Men adam.
How did he get this job?	Bu işi nädip aldy?
The work seemed insufficient.	Işi ýeterlik däl ýalydy.
I need a long break.	Maňa uzak dynç gerek bolar.
What a strange thing.	Nähili geň zat.
I just can't go back there.	Men diňe şol ýere gaýdyp bilemok.
You don't have to.	Bu size gerek däl.
No need.	Gerek däldi.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
There is no question about that.	Munuň üçin bir sorag ýok.
It seemed so easy.	Bu gaty aňsat ýalydy.
This is absolutely stupid.	Bu düýbünden samsyk.
The worst thing I can do.	Edip biljek iň erbet zady.
There.	Ol ýerde.
How long is it left?	Näçe wagt galdy
I thought you were.	Men sen diýip pikir etdim.
He was still there.	Ol henizem bardy.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
There is something else to decide.	Karar bermeli başga bir zat bar.
This is absolutely wonderful.	Bu düýbünden ajaýyp.
I saw him doing great.	Ony ajaýyp edýändigini gördüm.
The bad news is that.	Erbet habar muny etdi.
Something is happening.	Bir zat bolýar.
Because, of course.	Sebäbi, elbetde.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
Tomorrow is a big day.	Ertir uly gün.
Not here.	Bu ýerde däl.
I reported it to the police.	Men polisiýa habar berdim.
No problem, no problem, no worries.	Mesele ýok, mesele ýok, alada ýok.
What can we do about it?	Bu barada näme edip bileris?
There was a problem.	Birneme kynçylyk bardy.
He wanted it.	Ol muny isledi.
This is the right decision.	Bu dogry karar.
It's a really good thing.	Hakykatdanam gaty gowy zat.
It will be a good day.	Gowy gün bolar.
Of course, it's very difficult now.	Elbetde, häzir gaty kyn.
He is not stupid at all.	Ol düýbünden samsyk däl.
This is a difficult question.	Bu kyn sorag.
It did a good job.	Bu gowy iş etdi.
No more.	Indi ýok.
There is another.	Başga biri bar.
Big.	Uly.
He had a chance.	Oňa mümkinçilik bardy.
There is no future.	Geljek hiç zat ýok.
I have to decide.	Men karar bermeli.
No one wants to hurt.	Hiç kim zyýan bermek islemeýär.
He was very surprised.	Ol gaty geň galdy.
I don't believe it anymore.	Men indi muňa ynanamok.
Like a night	Gije ýaly.
The two are different.	Ikisi başga.
Because he didn't.	Sebäbi beýle etmedi.
I can't think of it now.	Indi bu barada pikir edip bilemok.
So you have to decide.	Şonuň üçin size karar bermeli.
And he does.	We şeýle edýär.
No work.	Iş ýok.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
This time someone closer to home.	Bu gezek öýe has ýakyn biri.
Only here.	Diňe şu ýerde.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
It was new and fresh.	Täze we täze boldy.
I think that was the case.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle boldy.
I'm not crazy	Men däli däl.
Nothing.	Hiç zat.
So it was weird.	Şonuň üçin bu geň boldy.
I just want to let you know.	Diňe size habar bermek isleýärin.
Tomorrow is tomorrow.	Ertir gün.
Oh, very good.	Aý, gaty gowy.
Once upon a time.	Bir gezek.
Maybe it will come in time.	Belki, wagt bilen geler.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I didn't think about it.	Men bu hakda hiç zat pikir etmedim.
I don't know him very well	Men ony beýle gowy bilemok
So you really don't have to say anything.	Şonuň üçin hakykatdanam hiç zat aýtmaly däl.
How long can you go?	Näçe wagt gidip bilersiňiz?
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Not much.	Kän däl.
I didn't want to.	Men islemedim.
Good.	Gowy.
I was myself again.	Men ýene özüm boldum.
We can still enjoy it.	Biz henizem lezzet alyp bileris.
Not only that.	Diňe däl.
A year ago.	Bir ýyl ozal.
We do not agree.	Biz razy däl.
Who said what.	Kim näme diýdi.
One is too much.	Biri gaty köp.
Nothing big.	Uly zat ýok.
That's not true.	Ol gaty dogry däl.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
He was right.	Ol muny dogry aýtdy.
It's not about the problem.	Bu kynçylyk hakda däl.
That would be nice.	Bu gowy bolar.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda muny indi etmeli.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
I'm not like anyone here.	Men bu ýerde hiç kim ýaly däl.
We are not ready for that yet.	Biz entek muňa taýyn däl.
I'm sorry for everything.	Hemme zat üçin gynanýaryn.
They are not really bad.	Olar hakykatdanam erbet däl.
I have to tell him.	Men oňa aýtmaly.
And money helps.	Pul bolsa kömek edýär.
This is not easy.	Bu beýle aňsat däl.
That should be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolmaly.
I think this is the best idea.	Bu meniň pikirimçe iň gowy pikir.
There was no call.	Jaň ýokdy.
That can't be true!	Bu dogry bolup bilmez!
He could see.	Ol görüp bilýärdi.
There was another man there.	Ol ýerde başga bir adam bardy.
He does this for everyone.	Muny hemmeler üçin edýär.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
No one did anything.	Hiç kim hiç zat etmedi.
Then something wonderful happens.	Soň ajaýyp bir zat bolýar.
She looks really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy görünýär.
Maybe there is someone else.	Belki başga biri bar.
You could say that trouble is his job.	Kynçylyk onuň işi diýip bilersiňiz.
This is nothing.	Bu hiç zat däl.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
I am human	Men adam
Worse.	Has erbet.
In fact, it was nothing.	Aslynda bu hiç zat däldi.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
There were a few questions.	Birnäçe sorag bardy.
It was good here.	Bu ýerde gowy boldy.
I don't want the truth.	Men hakykaty islämok.
I still have.	Men henizem bar.
It's still bad.	Ol henizem erbet.
The problem is not so.	Mesele, beýle däl.
We, you and I.	Biz, sen we men.
He was crazy.	Ol däli boldy.
That's not the reason.	Munuň sebäbi däl.
It could be.	Bu bolup biler.
You don't have to do anything.	Hiç zat etmeli däl.
It will not happen again.	Indi beýle bolmaz.
I want to do that again.	Men muny ýene bir gezek etmek isleýärin.
You should be happy and go soon.	Size bagtly, gysga wagtda gitmeli.
Something went wrong here.	Bu ýerde ýalňyşlyk boldy.
It shouldn't have been.	Bolmaly däldi.
This, of course, is a problem.	Bu, elbetde, bir mesele.
This is another matter.	Bu başga bir iş.
You don't have to do anything else.	Başga bir zat etmeli däl.
This is not clear.	Bu aýdyň däl.
He told me "no."	Ol maňa "ýok" diýdi.
It should be.	Bu bolmaly.
The police are here.	Polisiýa şu ýerde.
Maybe a lot.	Belki köp zat bolup biler.
You know, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Bilýärsiň, ol hiç kimi alyp bilenok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu düýbünden hemme zat.
This must be difficult for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin kyn bolsa gerek.
Strange, right?	Geň, şeýlemi?
You don't have to go anywhere.	Nirä gitmeli däl.
Oh, the last thing.	Aý, iň soňky zat.
I haven't seen you in a few weeks.	Birnäçe hepde bäri seni görmedim.
Has anyone seen it?	Ony gören barmy?
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
Because they were nothing.	Sebäbi olar hiç zat däldi.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
Man is smart.	Adam akylly.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
You can have a little rest.	Biraz dynç alyp bilersiňiz.
He will do very well.	Ol gaty gowy iş eder.
How to do this and what to get.	Muny nädip etmeli we näme almaly.
For me.	Meniň üçin.
I knew better.	Men has gowy bilýärdim.
This is crazy.	Bu däli.
Probably not such a bad thing.	Belki, beýle erbet zat däl bolsa gerek.
It's been a long time.	Köp wagt boldy.
He was not ready, he was not ready.	Ol taýyn däldi, taýyn däldi.
The word came out.	Söz çykdy.
I could not say anything.	Men hiç zat gürläp bilmedim.
I think it will help, of course.	Elbetde, bu kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin.
You can do this yourself.	Muny özüňiz edip bilersiňiz.
That was the case last year.	Geçen ýyl şeýle boldy.
They are fun!	Olar hezil!
Great job.	Uly iş.
This is great for you.	Bu siziň üçin ajaýyp.
It was bad.	Bu erbet boldy.
What will I do?	Näme etjek?
This is not the case.	Bu däl.
I called you several times.	Men saňa birnäçe gezek jaň etdim.
He took another.	Başga birini aldy.
I only care about you.	Men diňe sen hakda alada edýärin.
I'm not interested.	Men gyzykly däl.
I think that's right.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry.
Everyone is different.	Her bir adam başga.
Faster and faster and faster.	Has çalt we has çalt we has çalt.
It was here.	Bu ýerde boldy.
Nor will it be.	Şeýle hem bolmaz.
He wanted to do everything.	Ol hemme zady etmek isledi.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
Today is the day.	Bu gün gün boldy.
Of course, there is so much to talk about.	Elbetde, gürleşmek üçin gaty köp zat bar.
They were not there.	Olar ol ýerde däldi.
We are wonderful.	Biz ajaýyp.
I have no choice.	Mende başga ýol ýok.
There are a lot of people.	Adam köp.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
It can be as close as ever.	Öňküsi ýaly ýakyn bolup biler.
He even wants to.	Ol hatda isleýär.
It exists now, and then it disappears.	Häzirki wagtda bar, soň bolsa ýok bolýar.
I knew it would happen.	Boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
Now there is something else.	Indi ýene bir zat bar.
Not at all possible.	Asla mümkinçilik ýok.
It will not be the last time.	Iň soňky gezek hem bolmaz.
I was not.	Men beýle däldim.
This seems to be true.	Bu dogry ýaly.
You can say two words.	Iki söz aýdyp bilersiňiz.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
I'll call him.	Men oňa jaň ederin.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
Beautiful to see.	Görmek üçin owadan.
You can try.	Synap bilersiňiz.
Because we are human.	Sebäbi biz adam.
The money is there.	Pul şol ýerde.
They are close to home.	Olar öýe ýakyn.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Meniň üçin bu çynlakaý sebäp.
The food is there.	Nahar şol ýerde.
Probably more.	Has köp bolmagy ähtimal.
I was with him.	Men onuň bilen bile boldum.
Because there is another sound.	Sebäbi başga bir ses bar.
There has to be a better way!	Has gowy ýol bolmaly!
We are here.	Biz şu ýerde.
There has to be another way.	Bu hakykatdanam başga bir ýol bolmaly.
The evening came quickly.	Agşam çalt geldi.
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şonuň ýaly boldy.
This is a very serious matter.	Bu gaty çynlakaý mesele.
I was happy here.	Bu ýerde bagtly boldum.
It was a difficult evening.	Agşam kyn boldy.
No one likes it.	Hiç kim ony halamaýar.
I believe it would be very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly bolardy diýip ynanýaryn.
It's just money.	Bu diňe pul.
Never serious.	Hiç haçan çynlakaý däl.
I hope it will be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
There will be plenty here.	Bu ýerde köp bolar.
Once, he promised himself.	Bir gezek, özüne söz berdi.
I am very new.	Men gaty täze.
A happy person can tell.	Bir bagtly adam aýdyp biler.
It seems very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly ýaly.
Police arrested him.	Polisiýa ony tussag etdi.
He had no business here.	Bu ýerde onuň işi ýokdy.
She started going.	Ol gidip başlady.
And then he helped me.	Soň bolsa maňa kömek etdi.
Right here, every time it happens.	Edil şu ýerde, her gezek bolýar.
Of course, this was not a lie.	Elbetde, bu düýbünden ýalan däldi.
They are just there.	Olar diňe şol ýerde.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle.
We can never do that.	Biz hiç haçan edip bilmeris.
It would be bigger.	Bu has uly bolardy.
Well, not good.	Gowy, gowy däl.
That's all you have to do.	Diňe seniň etmeli zadyň.
What could happen.	Näme bolup biler.
It seems impossible.	Mümkin däl ýaly.
Interesting.	Gyzykly.
There is no answer to that.	Oňa jogap ýok.
This is great news.	Bu ajaýyp habar.
You can only do that.	Diňe muny edip bilersiňiz.
He was not.	Özi däldi.
I tried a few.	Birneme synap gördüm.
This meal wants you more.	Bu nahar size has köp zat isleýär.
In fact, always.	Aslynda hemişe.
No one did that.	Hiç kim muny etmedi.
It can take time.	Wagt alyp biler.
Because it is.	Sebäbi şeýle.
It must be gone.	Ol ýok bolmaly.
He wanted more for us.	Ol biziň üçin has köp zat isledi.
Sorry now	Indi bagyşlaň.
I think there is something.	Bir zat bar öýdýän.
We are here.	Biz şu ýerde.
Life is great!	Durmuş gaty gowy!
This is a very new thing.	Bu gaty täze zat.
Something happened to me that day.	Şol gün maňa bir zat boldy.
It just looks good.	Diňe gowy görünýär.
Many people did two things.	Köp adam iki iş etdi.
I can't do that either.	Meni hem etmek mümkin däl.
You don't have to see that.	Muny görmek hökman däl.
There is only one reason.	Diňe bir sebäp ýok.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
We can be really smart.	Biz hakykatdanam akylly bolup bileris.
Night.	Gije.
I know, I'm not alone.	Bilýärin, men ýeke däl.
I don't want to say anything else.	Başga zat aýtmak islämok.
I think so.	Bolýar diýip pikir edýärin.
It just can't be right.	Diňe dogry bolup bilmez.
Offered last night.	Düýn agşam teklip etdi.
Of course I know that.	Elbetde, muny bilýärin.
These things.	Bu zatlar.
Not very fun.	Gaty hezil däl.
In fact, he was not.	Aslynda ol ýokdy.
I have to tell the truth.	Hakykaty aýtmaly.
We are good.	Biz gowy.
It could be good.	Gowy bolup biler.
Must agree.	Razy bolmaly.
Everything seemed far, far away.	Hemme zat uzak, uzak ýalydy.
Really good.	Hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
We are still happy together.	Biz henizem bilelikde bagtly.
This will be a big challenge.	Bu uly kynçylyk bolar.
He has been there for a year.	Ol bir ýyl bäri şol ýerde.
For the first time	Ilkinji gezek
You will have to do better next time.	Indiki gezek has gowy etmeli bolarsyňyz.
This is not good for anyone.	Bu hiç kim üçin gowy däl.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
And great.	We ajaýyp.
I had fun this week.	Bu hepde hezil etdim.
He did not mind much.	Ol kän bir garşy däldi.
It was as if he could see it.	Ony görüp bilýän ýalydy.
Can you give it to me?	Maňa berip bilersiňizmi?
Now we can do this in an easy or difficult way.	Indi muny aňsat ýa-da kyn ýol bilen edip bileris.
It will take money.	Munuň üçin pul gerek bolar.
It was hard, it was hard.	Kyn, kyn boldy.
This is not what I want.	Bu meniň isleýän zadym däl.
It was nothing.	Bu hiç zat däldi.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
To me, this is not good and often not bad.	Meniň üçin bu has gowy däl we köplenç erbet däl ýaly.
I told him the truth.	Men oňa hakykaty aýtdym.
Probably stupid.	Mümkin, samsyk.
Maybe not so badly.	Belki beýle erbet bolmaz.
Then there was the meal.	Soň bolsa nahar bardy.
This was no longer possible.	Bu indi mümkin däldi.
I'll be fine one night.	Bir gije gowy bolaryn.
He really came to earth.	Ol hakykatdanam ýere geldi.
That's a good idea.	Aslynda gowy pikir.
Just like being at home.	Edil öýde bolmak ýaly.
He's just a great guy.	Ol diňe ajaýyp ýigit.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Good day	Gowy gün.
He never told the truth.	Ol hiç haçan hakykaty aýtmady.
You are different.	Siz başga.
Bad for him.	Onuň üçin erbet.
What about	Näme hakda?
Mom! 	Bu!
He can't love things very much.	Ol zatlary gaty gowy görüp bilmeýär.
That would be the case here.	Bu ýerde şeýle bolardy.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
He is a really good guy.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy ýigit.
This time it seemed too big to me.	Bu wagt maňa gaty uly ýalydy.
This seems impossible at all.	Bu düýbünden mümkin däl ýaly.
It's not easy for me anymore.	Meniň üçin indi aňsat däl.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
More lies.	Has köp ýalan.
He was very surprised.	Ol gaty geň galdy.
He was very good to me.	Ol maňa gaty gowy boldy.
Only the girl is here.	Diňe gyz şu ýerde.
I have to do something	Men bir zat etmeli
Everyone is great with it.	Hemmeler onuň bilen ajaýyp.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
Actually one.	Aslynda bir.

That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
I don’t know how he does it.	Men muny nädip edýändigini bilemok.
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu düýbünden dogry däl.
Same thing every year.	Her ýyl şol bir zat.
We we.	We we.
Of course, he didn't want to.	Elbetde, ol islemedi.
OK, not good.	Bolýar, gowy däl.
You know, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Bilýärsiň, ol gaty akylly.
That's right.	Hatda dogry.

I have to do that.	Men muny etmeli.
Even.	Hatda.
It's just you and me.	Bu diňe sen we men.
There was so much I didn't know.	Bilmeýän köp zady bardy.

He has to do it all himself.	Munuň hemmesini özi etmeli.
Is there	Ol ýerde barmy?
One.	Biri.
He came again tomorrow.	Ertir ýene geldi.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda beýle etmeli däl.
Maybe a little more.	Belki birneme kän.
This may be the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek bolup biler.
I told him what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny aýtdym.

You have to go	Sen gitmeli
I arrested him.	Men ony tussag etdim.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.

Tom returned an hour later.	Tom bir sagat soň gaýdyp geldi.
Everyone wants to talk about it.	Her kim bu hakda gürleşmek isleýär.

That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu ýerde şeýle.
About no one else.	Başga hiç kim hakda.
Whatever happens, happens.	Näme bolýar, bolýar.
As good as you are.	Özüňiz ýaly gowy.
Now it's time to dump her and move on.	Indi muny etmegiň wagty geldi.
He will never know.	Ol hiç haçan bilmez.
I don't know how, but it is.	Nädip bilemok, ýöne şeýle.
He wanted someone else, but he thought better.	Başga birini isledi, ýöne has gowy pikir etdi.
I thought they were gone.	Olar gitdi öýdüpdim.
There is not even an answer.	Hatda jogap ýok.

It could be a good thing.	Gowy bir zat bolup biler.
So he didn’t have to be anything.	Şonuň üçin ol hiç zat bolmaly däldi.
They are not the only option.	Olar diňe bir mümkinçilik däl.
I'm so scared of him.	Men onuň üçin gaty gorkýaryn.
Song.	Aýdym.
I do not agree.	Men razy däl.
It was not an easy decision.	Bu aňsat karar däldi.
You have to be very close.	Siz gaty ýakyn bolmaly.

This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.

There.	Ol ýerde.
It was really hard to see that.	Muny görmek hakykatdanam kyn boldy.

For the right time.	Dogry wagt üçin.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
There is no answer to that.	Oňa jogap ýok.
Of course, this will not be easy.	Elbetde, bu aňsat bolmaz.
Not bad, just not good.	Erbet däl, diňe gowy däl.
What is this	Bu näme.
Then he fed us.	Soň bolsa bize nahar berdi.
Good news to think about.	Pikir edip biljek gowy habar.
They still had something to do.	Entek etmeli zatlary bardy.
I have a lot of money.	Mende köp pul bar.
It can be really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy bolup biler.
Oh, that's very interesting.	Aý, bu gaty gyzykly.

That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
There was nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.

Something like this will not happen to you anymore.	Munuň ýaly zat saňa indi bolmaz.
Another good way.	Başga bir gowy ýol.
He had no time.	Onuň wagty ýokdy.
This is not really the best idea.	Bu hakykatdanam iň gowy pikir däl.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Gitmeli wagt geldi.
Of course, it will take some money.	Elbetde, munuň üçin birneme pul gerek bolar.

And not just with them.	Şeýle hem, diňe olar bilen däl.
This is the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek boldy.

He asked me for money.	Ol menden pul sorady.
He was no more.	Ol indi beýle däldi.
The two men did not.	Iki adam etmedi.
I don't have to worry about you.	Men sizi biynjalyk etmeli däl.

It's not like that, it won't be.	Munuň ýaly zat däl, beýle bolmaz.
Both are good.	Ikisi-de, ikisi-de gowy.

Oh, one more thing.	Aý, ýene bir zat.
So they are absolutely necessary.	Şonuň üçin olar düýbünden zerur.
It could be worse.	Has erbet bolup biler.
It was as if someone else was there.	Ol ýerde başga biri bar ýalydy.
He has to be with her now.	Ol häzir onuň bilen bolmaly.
I thought everything was very interesting.	Hemme zat gaty gyzykly diýip pikir etdim.
Where to go	Nirä gitmeli.
There are two possible reasons for this.	Belki, munuň iki sebäbi bar.
He came here yesterday.	Düýn bu ýere geldi.
An opportunity, perhaps.	Bir mümkinçilik, belki.
I was alone.	Men ýeke boldum.
It will not be difficult.	Kyn bolmaz.
Okay, last but not least.	Bolýar, bu barada iň soňky.
He arrested me.	Ol meni tussag etdi.
I want to talk to him.	Men onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.

It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
It's morning.	Irden boldy.
So the most interesting thing for me is to be difficult.	Şonuň üçin meniň üçin kyn bolmak iň gyzykly zat.
She must be at home.	Ol öýde bolmaly.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu wagt saňa dogry jogap.
Of course, this may take some time.	Elbetde, bu birneme wagt alyp biler.
Because he was no more.	Sebäbi ol indi däldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe iş.

And now.	Indi bolsa.

Who knows, you may be happy in the near future.	Kim bilýär, ýakyn wagtda bagtly bolup bilersiňiz.
You don't have to see it again.	Ony ýene görmek hökman däl.

Oh, no.	Aý, ýok.
He is such a good man.	Ol şeýle gowy adam.

This is very serious for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty çynlakaý.
What's next.	Indiki näme.
Everything, but everything is too much for him.	Hemme zat, ýöne hemme zat onuň üçin gaty köp.
I think that could be about me.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu meniň hakda bolup biler.
I never had to worry about anything.	Hiç haçan bir zat hakda alada etmeli däldim.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu mesele şu ýerde.
You have to pay attention.	Üns bermeli.
There was a good reason for that.	Munuň gowy sebäbi bardy.
He didn't do that.	Ol beýle zat etmedi.
He said he wanted to talk.	Ol gürleşmek isleýändigini aýtdy.
Almost now.	Häzir diýen ýaly.

It wasn’t really that bad.	Aslynda beýle erbet däldi.
And one day he does.	Bir gün bolsa şeýle edýär.
Maybe there is another reason.	Belki başga bir sebäbi bar.
So now you have a great opportunity.	Şonuň üçin indi siziň üçin ajaýyp bir mümkinçilik bar.

In fact, it already exists.	Aslynda, eýýäm bar.

You are beautiful	Sen owadan.

He also does this.	Mundan başga, muny edýär.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
That must be true.	Bu dogry bolmaly.
Of course we can't.	Elbetde, edip bilmeris.
I could do nothing to help her.	Men oňa kömek etmek üçin hiç zat edip bilmedim.
He will not object.	Ol muňa garşy bolmaz.
We just have to do it.	Biz diňe etmeli.
I can't do anything	Men hiç zat edip bilemok
Not bad.	Erbet däl.

Same thing.	Edil şol bir zat.
Whoever did that to me.	Kim maňa muny eden bolsa.
The sound bothers me.	Ses meni biynjalyk edýär.

And then.	Soň bolsa.
He was alone.	Ol ýeke boldy.
This time it was somewhere else.	Bu gezek başga ýerde boldy.
She had never been so beautiful before.	Ol ozal beýle owadan däldi.
What good advice this is.	Bu nähili gowy maslahat.
I enjoyed it.	Men lezzet aldym.

Good question!	Gowy sorag!
You only have to ask one or two questions.	Diňe bir ýa-da iki sorag bermeli.

Of course, there was no such thing.	Elbetde, beýle zat ýokdy.
He said it took time.	Wagt gerek diýdi.

Someone has to do that.	Kimdir biri muny etmeli.
There was also a full moon that day.	Şol gün doly aý hem bardy.
He just can't help it.	Ol diňe oňa kömek edip bilmeýär.
So it's very easy and impossible.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty aňsat we mümkin däl kyn.
It could be worse!	Has erbet bolup biler!.
I think he came here for you.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol bu ýere seniň üçin geldi.

Something is left.	Bir zat galdy.

It may have bothered you.	Seni biynjalyk eden bolmagy mümkin.
He had a chance.	Oňa mümkinçilik bardy.
Nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýok.
He had never thought of that before.	Ozal beýle pikir etmedi.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
He did not want to talk about it.	Ol bu hakda gürleşmek islemedi.
More	Has köp.
I just thought.	Men diňe pikir etdim.
I heard	Eşitdim
I said no.	Men onuň ýokdugyny aýtdym.
He may have tried something once.	Bir wagt bir zady synap gören bolmagy mümkin.
This could be the reason.	Munuň sebäbi bolup biler.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
In fact, there is no such thing as good or bad.	Aslynda gowy ýa-da erbet zat ýok.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Stupid.	Samsyk.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, beýle däl.
She is really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy.
This is certainly not the case.	Bu, elbetde dogry däl.
I had a little rest.	Biraz dynç aldym.
Of course, this is a difficult issue.	Elbetde, bu kyn mesele.
They were there for us.	Olar bize bardy.
Now this is not very interesting.	Indi bu gaty bir gyzykly däl.
No hard day.	Kyn gün ýok.

What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Siziň üçin nähili gowy zat.
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýok.
I thought it was a good idea.	Gowy pikir diýip pikir etdim.
Good to see you again	Seni ýene görmek gowy zat.
Then there was no other way.	Soň başga ýol ýokdy.
The answer is nothing.	Jogap hiç zat däl.
This is a concern.	Bu alada.
That's too much for anyone.	Bu hiç kim üçin gaty köp.

I believe in him completely.	Men oňa doly ynanýaryn.

That sounds interesting.	Bu gyzykly ýaly.
It seemed like a great idea at the time.	Şol wagt gaty gowy pikir ýalydy.

There was something disturbing there.	Ol ýerde biynjalyk bir zat bardy.
The work is not too bad.	Iş gaty erbet däl.

That's a lot of people.	Bu gaty köp adam.
I heard it myself yesterday.	Düýn ony özüm eşitdim.
Very good for the first time.	Ilkinji gezek gaty gowy.
He no longer wanted to think about such things.	Indi munuň ýaly zatlar hakda pikir etmek islemedi.
I did not offer to help.	Kömek etmegi teklip etmedim.
This is an interesting question.	Bu gyzykly sorag.
It was really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn boldy.
It could be several months.	Birnäçe aý bolup biler.
I was very tired.	Men gaty boldum.
He wants to talk.	Ol gürleşmek isleýär.
I have a lot.	Mende köp.
I want you	Men seni isleýärin
He began to see the problem.	Meseläni görüp başlady.
The only thing that matters is this.	Munuň bilen ýeke-täk zat.

This is crazy.	Bu däli.
He began to speak.	Ol gürläp başlady.
He never said that.	Ol muny hiç haçan aýdyp bilmedi.

This is a more interesting question.	Bu has gyzykly sorag.
I thought about it.	Bu hakda pikir etdim.
I didn't really think so.	Aslynda beýle pikir etmedim.

Someone knew about money.	Kimdir biri pul hakda bilýärdi.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
I have never seen anything like it.	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim.
You can try it yourself.	Muny özüňiz synap bilersiňiz.
There is also no sound.	Şeýle hem ses ýok.
He has an idea.	Oňa bir pikir gelýär.
He was very good to me.	Ol maňa gaty gowy boldy.
If only there was one thing.	Diňe bir zat bar bolsa.

There will be a lot of questions this week.	Bu hepde köp sorag bolar.
It's been three years.	Bu hakykatdanam üç ýyl boldy.
Actually about the two of us.	Aslynda ikimiz hakda.
In fact, it is not.	Aslynda ol beýle däl.
It can't be good.	Gowy bolup bilmez.
No one paid attention.	Hiç kim muňa üns bermedi.
No one should go.	Hiç kim gitmeli däl.
Not always.	Hemişe däl.
Maybe he shouldn’t have done anything.	Belki, hiç zat etmeli däldi.
He didn't know where to go.	Ol nirä gitmek isleýändigini bilmeýärdi.
No one is new.	Hiç kim täze adam däl.
And then the most important thing.	Soň bolsa, iň zerur zat.
Good.	Gowy.
A man	Bir adam.
Something bad.	Erbet bir zat.
Where are they	Olar nirede?
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
I caused it.	Men muňa sebäp boldum.
It comes with being human.	Bu adam bolmak bilen gelýär.
He could not speak.	Ol gürläp bilmedi.
He was with them.	Ol olar bilen boldy.
I've seen it and it still looks good to me.	Men muny gördüm we henizem maňa gowy görünýär.
He is better.	Ol has gowy.
So we can be better.	Şonuň üçin has gowy bolup bileris.
There is still plenty of time for more.	Has köp zat üçin entek köp wagt bar.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
He wants to see her again.	Ony ýene bir gezek görmek isleýär.
What a good idea.	Nähili gowy pikir.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Also, two years ago.	Mundan başga, iki ýyl ozal başga bir gezek.
There are three possible reasons for this.	Munuň üç sebäbi bolup biler.
This is the last.	Bu iň soňky.
Quick.	Çalt.
We are here.	Biz şu ýerde.
I couldn't sleep tonight.	Şu gije uklap bilmedim.
Must do.	Etmeli.
Every morning	Her gün irden.
He was not himself.	Ol özi däldi.
Another person.	Başga adam.
We can't do it yet.	Biz entek edip bilmeris.
Here it is.	Ine iki.
I am a young man.	Men ýigit.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, edil şonuň ýaly bolmaly.
He took her home.	Ony öýüne alyp gitdi.
Everyone could see that.	Muny hemmeler görüp bilýärdi.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
He said he could definitely help.	Ol hökman kömek edip biljekdigini aýtdy.
He really does.	Hakykatdanam şeýle edýär.
Just stupid.	Diňe samsyk.
Good.	Gowy.
Here he comes.	Ine, ol gelýär.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
One person is good and one person is not good.	Bir adam gowy, bir adam gowy däl.
Nothing and no one.	Hiç zat we hiç kim.
He knows what he knows.	Bilýän zadyny bilýär.
A tip.	Bir maslahat.
Makes me crazy.	Meni däli edýär.
How crazy this is.	Bu nähili däli.
It was good there.	Ol ýerde gowy boldy.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
I can get there easily.	Men ol ýere ýeterlik aňsat baryp bilerin.
Stop doing that.	Muny etmegi bes et.
There are only a few words left.	Diňe birnäçe söz galdy.
Maybe not at all.	Belki asla bolmaz.
That's what I'm trying to do.	Etjek bolýan zady.
Of course, he didn't do it alone.	Elbetde, muny ýeke özi etmedi.
This is what made us human.	Bu bizi adam eden zat.
It takes a while here.	Bu ýerde biraz wagt gerek.
The question is what to do about it?	Sorag bu hakda näme etmeli?
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
This is not new.	Bu täze däl.
She is very happy.	Ol gaty bagtly.
Anyone can see someone else.	Her kim başga birini görüp biler.
Looks a little bad there.	Ol ýerde birneme erbet görünýär.
What time is it	Wagt näçe?
I've never done that before.	Men ozal beýle zady etmedim.
It can't hurt me.	Bu maňa zyýan berip bilmez.
I had a lot of fun.	Gaty hezil etdim.
It takes money.	Munuň üçin pul gerek.
I did.	Men etdim.
Everything was fast.	Hemme zat çalt boldy.
He did it again.	Ol ýene etdi.
There is no money there.	Ol ýerde pul ýok.
I do not want	Men islämok
This must have happened a few years ago.	Bu birnäçe ýyl ozal bolup geçen bolmaly.
Why do it!	Näme üçin etmeli!
It's not just about me.	Bu diňe men hakda däl.
I don't want to be anywhere else.	Başga bir ýerde bolmak islämok.
I think he says the same thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, edil şonuň ýaly aýdýar.
That should be the answer.	Bu jogap bolmaly.
With a girl	Gyz bilen.
He doesn't come home.	Öýüne gelenok.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
This sound, the way, the way, is more interesting.	Bu ses, ýol, ýol, has gyzykly.
Everyone always wants more than enough.	Her kim elmydama ýeterlik däl köp zady isleýär.
Good way	Gowy ýol.
Oh, they were still there.	Aý, olar henizem bardy.
To me	Maňa.
I thought about you this morning.	Şu gün irden sen hakda pikir etdim.
More about that in the near future.	Bu barada has ýakyn wagtda.
Everything is happening now.	Hemme zat indi bolýar.
Maybe not.	Belki beýle bolmaz.
That was not true for me.	Meniň üçin bu dogry däldi.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
I'm not beautiful.	Men owadan däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu siziň etmeli.
'.	'.
He just wanted to talk to her.	Ol diňe onuň bilen gürleşmek isledi.
You can sleep better from now on.	Mundan beýläk gowy uklap bilersiňiz.
That's not enough.	Ol ýeterlik däl.
So this is not for me.	Şonuň üçin bu meniň üçin ýok.
It was just a weird day.	Bu diňe geň gün boldy.
What is this	Bu näme.
Take it with you.	Bile alyp gitmek.
No work, no money.	Iş ýok, pul ýok.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
He didn't have to say it, he knew it.	Ol muny aýtmaly däldi, bilýärdi.
Question, what.	Sorag, näme.
He needs a good man.	Oňa gowy adam gerek.
With a question.	Sorag bilen.
This is very good news.	Bu gaty gowy habar.
I still don't have an answer.	Mende henizem jogap ýok.
Not now, maybe not now.	Indi däl, belki indi bolmaz.
I still can't believe it.	Men henizem ynanamok.
It was very difficult for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty kyn boldy.
Not too much.	Gaty kän däl.
I didn't see that	Men muny görmedim
This is not true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry däl.
It made him happy.	Bu oňa lezzet berdi.
You have to be hard.	Siz gaty bolmaly.
It's great to see you again.	Seni ýene görmek gaty gowy zat.
What did this do to me?	Bu meniň üçin näme etdi.
He was with her too.	Ol hem onuň bilen boldy.
It doesn't take long.	Munuň üçin köp wagt gerek däl.
He already understood.	Ol eýýäm düşündi.
I tried.	Men synap gördüm.
No more. '	Indi ýok '.
No such thing was needed.	Munuň ýaly zat gerek däldi.
It is nothing.	Ol hiç zat däl.
Of course it can.	Elbetde bolup biler.
I think he will.	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle eder.
He does not agree.	Ol razy däl.
You have to give everything.	Hemme zady bermeli.
Please!	Haýyş edýärin!
He decided, he didn't decide.	Ol karar berdi, karar bermedi.
Not often.	Köplenç däl.
He thought it was possible.	Mümkin diýip pikir etdi.
I hope it will be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
We can't do that here.	Bu ýerde muny edip bilmeris.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
This, of course.	Bu, elbetde.
It's hard.	Kyn zat.
The girl agreed to go with him.	Gyz özi bilen gitmäge razy boldy.
It's not just about money.	Bu diňe pul hakda däl.
I never thought about it.	Men bu hakda hiç wagt pikir etmedim.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I had never thought of that before.	Bu hakda öňem pikir etmedim.
He may be right.	Dogry aýdyp biler.
That's what happened.	Ol şeýle boldy.
Help me	Maňa kömek et
Just one.	Diňe bir.

Everything was fine until last week.	Geçen hepde çenli hemme zat gowy boldy.
A lot has happened.	Köp zat boldy.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
We are not close.	Biz ýakyn däl.
They thought it would be better.	Olar has gowy bolardy diýip pikir etdi.
She had to answer a lot.	Oňa köp jogap bermeli boldy.
Something about them.	Olar hakda bir zat.
I said next week.	Geljek hepde aýtdym.
He was not human either.	Ol hem adam däldi.
This is the only way.	Bu ýeke-täk ýol.
They didn’t seem happy.	Olar bagtly ýaly däldi.
Of course, it will not be long.	Elbetde, ol uzak bolmaz.
This is very crazy.	Bu gaty däli.
And for him, there was everything.	Onuň üçin bolsa, bar zady bardy.
I did, I did.	Etdim, men etdim.
I'm in the right place.	Men dogry ýerde.
It was the same as before.	Öňküsi ýalydy.

Of course, it looks good.	Elbetde, ol gowy görünýär.

No word on why.	Näme üçin söz ýok.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.

Maybe this will be the case.	Belki, bu bir zat bolar.
This is an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş.
He could say a lot.	Ol köp zady aýdyp bilýärdi.
This, man.	Bu, adam.
He was everywhere.	Ol hemme ýerde ýalydy.
Then something happens.	Soň bir zat bolýar.
There was a problem.	Bir mesele bardy.

This was the last.	Bu iň soňky boldy.
New year	Täze ýyl.
No one.	Adam ýok.
It was a great three weeks.	Üç hepde gaty gowy boldy.
I just couldn’t get it.	Men diňe alyp bilmedim.
In fact, there is not much.	Aslynda gaty köp zat ýok.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I made no mistake.	Mende hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýokdy.
With that.	Bu bilen.
This was not very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal däldi.
When to go?	Haçan gitmeli?
He said it was very good.	Ol gaty gowy diýdi.
Of course I knew.	Elbetde, bilýärdim.
Maybe he thought.	Belki, pikir etdi.
I was there for three days.	Men ol ýerde üç gün boldum.
Because it is really a lie.	Sebäbi hakykatdanam ýalan.
Crazy about that.	Bu hakda däli.
Now, you have to decide.	Indi, size karar bermeli.
It was hard.	Bu kyn boldy.
I believe in him.	Men oňa ynanýaryn.
It looks pretty good.	Ol düýbünden diýen ýaly gowy görünýär.
That's the way it is.	Ine, şeýle bolar.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilmez.
We can't do that.	Muny edip bilmeris.
I received a message from you.	Men size habar aldym.
Nothing.	Hiç zat däl.
It's not even close.	Bu hatda ýakyn hem däl.
I don't have to go anywhere.	Men hiç ýere gitmek hökman däl.
It didn’t seem to be against it.	Muňa garşy däl ýalydy.
Nothing else.	Başga zat däl.
It's not just here.	Bu diňe şu ýerde däl.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Maybe not.	Belki beýle bolmaz.
And then there would be enough time for that.	Soň bolsa munuň üçin ýeterlik wagt bolardy.
This is nothing.	Bu hiç zat däl.
What are they	Olar näme?
Had to pay attention.	Üns bermeli boldy.
I have a strange problem.	Mende geň bir mesele bar.
And then here it is.	Soň bolsa şu ýerde.
I had no problem with it.	Men onuň bilen hiç hili mesele görmedim.
I thought about it.	Men bu barada pikir etdim.
I should have known better.	Men has gowy bilýän bolmaly.
The police are there now.	Polisiýa häzir bar.
Maybe it already exists.	Belki, eýýäm bar.
You have to ask that.	Muny sorag etmeli.
Here he is, taking me.	Ine, meni aldy.
He must have known that.	Ol muny bilýän bolmaly.
I thought about getting it.	Almak hakda pikir etdim.
It seems strange to me.	Maňa geň görünýär.
This is not surprising.	Bu gaty geň däl.
He is doing very well.	Ol gaty gowy iş edýär.
You have to call the police.	Polisiýa jaň etmeli.
He is still there.	Ol henizem şol ýerde.
I tried to do everything myself.	Hemme zady özüm etjek boldum.
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
He could not say for sure if he had already done so.	Ol muny eýýäm edendigini aýdyp bilmedi.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
At that time.	Şol wagt.
Here's what happened.	Ine, näme boldy.
You can have a little rest.	Biraz dynç alyp bilersiňiz.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
There was a reason for this, but it was not the only one.	Munuň sebäbi bardy, ýöne ýeke däl.
He did it himself.	Özüni şeýle etdi.
This was not the way.	Bu ýol däldi.
No one has been able to do that since.	Mundan beýläk hiç kim edip bilmedi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
We have to go.	Biz gitmeli.
It is not difficult for me to make this decision.	Meniň üçin bu karar bermek kyn däl.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
This is interesting	Bu gyzykly
She is happy.	Ol bagtly.
There is no reason to do it here.	Bu ýerde etmegiň sebäbi ýok.
What could be better?!.	Has gowy näme bolup biler?!.
Oh, great.	Aý, ajaýyp.
This man did just that.	Bu adam oňa diňe bir zat etdi.
It will be difficult for him.	Bu onuň üçin kyn bolar.

Of course it was great with me.	Elbetde, bu meniň bilen gaty gowy boldy.
Now more.	Indi has köp.
I really want to relax	Men hakykatdanam dynç almak isleýärin
It wasn't that bad.	Bu beýle erbet däldi.
This is a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý mesele.
I'm fine.	Men gowy.
He understood.	Ol düşündi.
I was close to him.	Men oňa ýakyn boldum.
He thought it was strange and wonderful.	Ol nähili geň we ajaýyp diýip pikir etdi.
They have to be one thing or another.	Olar bir zat ýa-da başga bir zat bolmaly.
I have to report everything immediately.	Hemme zady derrew maňa habar bermeli.
I'll call him today.	Men oňa şu gün jaň ederin.
I don't think that's right.	Munuň üçin dogry däl öýdemok.
He knew it, but it didn't help.	Ol muny bilýärdi, ýöne birneme kömek etmedi.
He tried to call me.	Ol maňa jaň etjek boldy.
You have to give one.	Birini bermeli.
Maybe they are not enough.	Belki, olar ýeterlik däl.
I don’t know if he did or not.	Edendigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilemok.
Everyone knew that.	Muny hemmeler bilýärdi.
That's right.	Dogry.
Because he was not himself.	Sebäbi onuň özi däldi.
He greeted me with a long voice.	Ol meni uzak ses bilen garşy aldy.
He knew it wasn't going to happen.	Ol munuň özi däldigini bilýärdi.
You can do something like this.	Munuň ýaly bir zat edip bilersiňiz.
We are there.	Biz şol ýerde.
You must be crazy.	Sen däli bolmaly.
I did it myself.	Muny özüm etdim.
Of course you know that.	Elbetde, muny bilýärsiň.
Life.	Durmuş.
We are no more.	Biz indi hiç kim däl.
Bad moon	Erbet aý.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.

There is no work for you there.	Ol ýerde siziň üçin iş ýok.
You are just wonderful	Siz diňe bir ajaýyp
Everything seems to be right.	Hemme zat edil dogry ýaly görünýär.
You have to be smart.	Akylly bolmaly.
It started well, he looked like a good guy.	Gowy başlady, ol gowy ýigit ýalydy.
There will be other things.	Başga zatlar bolar.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
In fact, it is very difficult.	Aslynda bu gaty kyn.
You have to get everything right.	Hemme zady dogry almaly.
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
There was no one.	Hiç kim ýokdy.
I was fine.	Men gowy boldum.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
Not for him.	Onuň üçin däl.

It looked really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy ýalydy.
You think he's a good guy.	Siziň pikiriňizçe ol gowy ýigit.

That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, beýle däl.
He knows everything.	Ol hemme zady bilýär.
Of course, this was nothing new.	Elbetde, bu täze zat däldi.
Maybe not everywhere.	Belki hemme ýerde däl.
This is not a difficult task.	Bu kyn mesele däl.
I have something to tell you.	Men saňa bir zat aýtmaly.
He did too.	Ol hem etdi.
It may not be possible, but it is.	Mümkin däl bolmagy mümkin, ýöne şeýle bolýar.
It was not just a sound.	Bu diňe bir ses däldi.
I tried it, but I couldn't.	Men muny synap gördüm, ýöne edip bilmedim.
It was really good for me.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň üçin gowy boldy.
I knew he had it.	Men onuň bardygyny bilýärdim.
I tried them all.	Men hemmesini synap gördüm.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.

I bought a few things	Birnäçe zat satyn aldym
He was not there.	Ol ýerde ýokdy.

I can't tell you anything	Men saňa hiç zat aýdyp biljek däl
They weren't even thinking.	Olar hatda pikir hem däldi.
The answer was why not.	Näme üçin beýle däl diýen jogap boldy.
Three times last night.	Düýn agşam, üç gezek.
"Good girl," she said.	Ol: "Gowy gyz" -diýdi.
He must be crazy.	Ol däli bolmaly.
So we are not.	Şonuň üçin biz beýle däl.
There was no other way for him.	Onuň üçin bu başga ýol däldi.
It was not serious.	Bu çynlakaý däldi.
He didn't have much time.	Kän wagty ýokdy.
Not a beautiful one.	Bir owadan däl.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I think he does a great job.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gaty gowy iş edýär.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
He answered with the same answer twice.	Ol şol bir jogap bilen iki gezek jogap berdi.
The answer is no good.	Jogap, asla gowy däl.
No questions asked.	Sorag ýok.
I need a new challenge, it will be fun.	Maňa täze kynçylyk gerek, gyzykly bolar.
This was not the case.	Mümkinçilik beýle däldi.
That's fine with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy.
She is a beautiful girl.	Ol ajaýyp gyz.
I was not.	Men beýle däldim.
It may even be necessary.	Hatda zerur bolup biler.

It's too late tonight.	Şu gün agşam gaty köp.

I did it myself.	Men muny özüm etdim.
I didn't think that would be possible for me.	Bu meniň üçin mümkin bolar öýdemokdym.
Then he realized.	Soň düşündi.
He did not say anything.	Ol hiç zat aýtmady.
It will be.	Bu bolar.
He can't do anything.	Hiç zat edip bilmeýär.
This may still be the case.	Bu henizem bolup biler.
Hope is something.	Umyt bir zat.
It's beautiful, of course, but it has nothing to do with it.	Elbetde owadan, ýöne hiç hili işi ýok.
I could be that guy.	Men ol ýigit bolup bilerin.
I do that	Men muny edýärin
This is interesting	Bu gyzykly
It was great to see.	Görmek gaty gowy boldy.
So you have to decide.	Şonuň üçin karar bermeli.
I was fine.	Men gowy boldum.
I think a lot of people do that.	Meniň pikirimçe, köp adam şeýle edýär.
Last time.	Soňky gezek.
That's what happens.	Ine, şeýle bolýar.
Maybe more time.	Belki has köp wagt.
Once upon a time, it wasn't a big deal.	Bir gezek geldi, kän bir mesele däl.

Not there.	Ol ýerde ýok.

I'm fine.	Men gowy.
It was actually yesterday.	Aslynda düýn boldy.
He thought it was time.	Wagt geldi diýip pikir etdi.
This is indeed true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry.
I was bad.	Men erbet boldum.
It will be the same tomorrow.	Ertir hem şeýle bolar.
I don't do that anymore.	Indi beýle zatlary etmeýärin.

As of now	Häzirki ýaly.

It's time to dump her and move on.	Onuň gitmeli wagty geldi.
No more.	Indi ýok.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
What do you need	Size näme gerek.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
How many people live here?	Bu ýerde näçe adam ýaşaýar?
What happened.	Näme boldy.
This is now possible.	Bu indi mümkin.
I'm the worst	Men iň erbet
It's too big	Bu gaty uly
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
I didn't know that before.	Öň bilmedim.
It won't be bad.	Bu erbet bolmaz.
He behaved like a fool.	Özüni samsyk ýaly alyp bardy.
I just want to talk.	Men diňe gürleşmek isleýärin.
He took her there.	Ol şol ýere alyp bardy.
There is nothing more serious.	Has çynlakaý zat ýok.
So that is not enough.	Şonuň üçin bu ýeterlik däl.
Why?	Näme üçin?
Bad for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin erbet.
You are there.	Sen şol ýerde.
I did a lot.	Men gaty köp zat etdim.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Do you want to buy here?	Bu ýerde satyn almak isleýärsiňizmi?
I had a lot of fun today.	Bu gün gaty hezil etdim.
This is crazy.	Bu däli.
No one can ask a question.	Hiç kim sorag berip bilmez.
No sound.	Ses ýok.
Really crazy.	Hakykatdanam, däli.
He thought he needed help.	Kömek almaly bolsa gerek diýip pikir etdi.
Definitely.	Hökman.
You have to buy it now.	Ony şu wagt satyn almaly.
This is exactly what happened.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
No one wants to.	Hiç kim islemeýär.
Many people come every year.	Her ýyl köp adam gelýär.

This is a decision.	Bu karar.
Here, at home.	Bu ýerde, öýde.
Because it is not.	Sebäbi beýle däl.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
He did not ask any questions about it.	Ol bu barada hiç hili sorag bermedi.
Couldn't be.	Bolup bilmedi.
Oh, time.	Aý, wagt.
It was nothing but fun.	Bu hezil etmekden başga zat däldi.
There has to be a better way.	Has gowy ýol bolmaly.
He should be here too.	Ol hem şu ýerde bolmaly.
I never had money.	Mende hiç wagt pul ýokdy.
Looks younger.	Has ýaş görünýär.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
Probably.	Mümkin.
I think he never did.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hiç wagt etmedi.
That's not the point.	Bu ýerde mesele däl.
You have to go.	Gitmeli.
That's a lot!	Bu gaty köp!
This will not be a big deal.	Bu gaty bir iş bolmaz.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
He knew he was there.	Ol özüniň bardygyny bilýärdi.
He seems to know a lot about them.	Olar hakda köp zat bilýän ýaly.
I had to go to work tomorrow.	Ertir işe gitmeli boldum.
Maybe a hundred.	Belki ýüz.
The future is not like that.	Geljek beýle däl.
This is another matter.	Bu başga mesele.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
That's exactly what happened.	Bu edil şeýle boldy.
Good.	Gowy.
now the question was.	indi sorag boldy.
It had to be destroyed for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin ýok etmeli boldy.
He is someone and you are not.	Ol kimdir biri, siz bolsa hiç kim däl.
I had no problem.	Mende hiç hili mesele ýokdy.
You have to tell me what happened.	Näme bolandygyny maňa aýtmaly.
No one else knows or knows.	Başga hiç kim bilmez ýa-da bilmez.
Because it happens a lot.	Sebäbi bu köp bolýar.
Many people will come.	Köp adam geler.
Saying it out loud is another thing.	Gaty ses bilen aýtmak başga zat.
Last but not least.	Iň soňky.
It wasn't that bad last year, was it?	Geçen ýyl beýle erbet däldi, şeýlemi?
No one asked him a question.	Hiç kim oňa sorag bermedi.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
This is a new day.	Bu täze gün.
We are here.	Biz şu ýerde.
I'm not good.	Men gowy däl.
You are too big	Siz gaty uly
I don’t even want to do that.	Men hatda muny etmek islämok.
I know that myself.	Muny özüm bilýärin.
Everyone knew everything.	Her kim hemme zady bilýärdi.
I can't stop worrying.	Alada etmegi bes edip bilemok.
He was a little surprised.	Ol birneme geň galdy.
It was good with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy boldy.
He knows what happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilýär.
In fact, many.	Aslynda köp.
Then he went out to see what had happened.	Soň bolsa näme bolandygyny görmek üçin çykdy.
No one comes to talk to me.	Hiç kim meniň bilen gürleşmek üçin gelenok.
It doesn't seem right.	Dogry däl ýaly.
He did not want to do that anymore.	Ol mundan beýläk etmek islemedi.
Not a bad thing.	Erbet zat däl.
He could no longer see.	Ol indi görüp bilmedi.
And then he said.	Soň bolsa aýtdy.
Not even close.	Hatda ýakyn däl.
Not there.	Ol ýerde däl.
I just didn’t want to.	Men diňe islemedim.
I will do very well now.	Indi gaty gowy ederin.
This is us.	Bu biz.
Definitely smart.	Elbetde, akylly.
In fact, he knew nothing.	Aslynda ol hiç zady bilmeýärdi.
The question is how.	Sorag nädip boldy.
Time is short.	Wagt gysga.
Something to give.	Bermeli bir zat.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň, ine şeýle.
It looks great.	Bu ajaýyp görünýär.
We are good.	Biz gowy.
I really don't know.	Men hakykatdanam bilemok.
It was as if he wanted to.	Muny isleýän ýalydy.
He called and told me.	Ol jaň etdi we maňa aýtdy.
There is no such thing at home.	Öýde beýle zat ýok.
It's been a while	Biraz wagt boldy
Probably.	Mümkin.
We need to rest.	Biz dynç almaly.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
He comes here.	Ol şu ýere gelýär.
I think this is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk diýip pikir edýärin.
It will take some time.	Birneme wagt gerek.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
To help him.	Oňa kömek etmek üçin.
It was possible.	Bu mümkin boldy.
Everyone wants money.	Her kim pul isleýär.
Now.	Indi.
It won't happen anymore.	Indi bolmaz.
I didn't need to.	Maňa gerek däldi.
I don’t want to be arrested, but it’s a mistake.	Meni tussag etmek islämok, ýöne ýalňyşlyk.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
Not his thing.	Onuň zady däl.
The opportunity was immediately clear.	Mümkinçilik derrew aýdyň boldy.
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şonuň ýaly boldy.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Big girl	Uly gyz.
I'll be fine	Men gowy bolaryn
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
I haven't been able to get there yet.	Men entek ol ýere baryp bilmedim.
I lied about it.	Men muny ýalan etdim.
I want to be here and see this.	Bu ýerde bolmak we bu zady görmek isleýärin.
I saw what he could do last night.	Düýn agşam näme edip biljekdigini gördüm.
A long time ago.	Köp wagt ozal.
He wanted me.	Ol meni isledi.
So close.	Şonuň üçin ýakyn.
Not much, not much.	Kän däl diýen ýaly gaty kän.
Nothing is more than words.	Hiç zat diňe söz däl.
Long time no see	Uzak wagt
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
Maybe three times.	Belki üç gezek.
The same idea applies to him.	Edil şonuň ýaly pikir hem oňa gelýär.
He hadn't done anything for weeks.	Birnäçe hepde bäri hiç zat etmedi.
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
It was just that.	Bu edil şonuň ýalydy.
It was not his business.	Bu onuň işi däldi.
I do nothing	Men hiç zat etmeýärin
I think that's great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy.
I can see that a lot.	Men muny köp görüp bilýärin.
Sorry for everything.	Hemme zat üçin bagyşlaň.
I have nothing to do.	Meniň etjek zadym ýok.
I think it went a little earlier.	Meniň pikirimçe, birneme öň gitdi.
How did he say that?	Ol muny nädip aýtdy.
Another way.	Başga bir ýol.
This will be really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet bolar.
A year ago.	Bir ýyl mundan ozal.
This book is not new.	Bu kitap täze däl.
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şeýle boldy.
Two weeks? 	Iki hepde?
It's great to think about it.	Bu hakda pikir etmek gaty ajaýyp.
Of course, I will do more with them.	Elbetde, olar bilen has köp iş ederin.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
She is a really good girl.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy gyz.
Not a problem at all.	Asla mesele däl.
He didn't want to.	Ol muny islemedi.
There will be a day tomorrow.	Ertir bir gün bolar.
The word came out.	Söz çykdy.
He didn't do it anymore and he can't do it.	Indi etmedi we edip bilmeýär.
I need such help.	Maňa şeýle kömek gerek.
It didn’t seem like a big deal.	Bu uly bir zat däl ýalydy.
That's fine with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy.
I can do it. '	Edip bilerin '.
Just then it came to me.	Edil şol wagt maňa geldi.
I still want one.	Men henizem birini isleýärin.
It was nice to see him here.	Ony şu ýerde görmek gowy boldy.
This is not happy.	Bu bagtly däl.
I did it	Men muny etdim
And you are not.	Sen bolsa beýle däl.
He told me so.	Ol maňa şeýle diýdi.
There are two reasons for doing this.	Muny etmegiň iki sebäbi bar.
You have to do that	Muny etmeli
Needless to say.	Muny aýtmak hökman däldi.
He gave me the money.	Ol maňa pul berdi.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
which one is really great ???.	aslynda haýsy ajaýyp ???.
He asked for an answer.	Jogap sorady.
Ol.	Ol.
Now there is no time to worry about that.	Indi bu barada alada etmäge wagt ýok.
Only.	Diňe.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
There was nothing to worry about.	Alada etmeli zat ýokdy.
This looks great on me.	Bu maňa gaty gowy görünýär.
I was a little surprised.	Birneme geň galdy.
You know	Bilýärsiň.
For good reason.	Gowy sebäp bilen.
I don't know how that helps.	Munuň nähili kömek edýändigini bilemok.
I don’t have to decide anymore.	Men indi karar bermeli däl.
How is that possible?	Ol ýerde nädip mümkin.
I think it's great.	Ajaýyp diýip pikir edýärin.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
And then something happened.	Soň bolsa bir zat boldy.
I question that.	Men muny sorag edýärin.
Everything is possible now.	Häzirki wagtda hemme zat mümkin.
I saw what he was doing for you.	Onuň siziň üçin näme edýändigini gördüm.
I agree with that.	Men muňa razy boldum.
I'll be fine now.	Men häzir gowy bolaryn.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
I never did that again.	Men muny ýene etmedim.
Not a big deal.	Uly mümkinçilik däl.
We both have.	Ikimizem bar.
I'm afraid that's the case.	Bu mesele diýip gorkýaryn.
Of course he didn't.	Elbetde, aýtmady.
Really far away.	Hakykatdanam gaty uzak.
He lives.	Ol ýaşaýar.
You can tell me the truth.	Maňa hakykaty aýdyp bilersiňiz.
The man is a happy young man.	Adam bagtly ýigit.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
It was really a collaborative effort.	Bu, hakykatdanam, bilelikde iş boldy.
She is wonderful.	Ol ajaýyp.
When	Haçan.
He is not going to do that.	Ol muny etjek däl.
It will be difficult for him.	Bu oňa kyn bolar.
Life is so fast.	Durmuş gaty çalt bolýar.
I hoped it would happen.	Islän zady bolar diýip umyt etdim.
There is no one else like us.	Biz ýaly başga adam ýok.
Where are they	Olar nirede?
How does he do that?	Ol muny nädip edýär?
Every week	Her hepde.
I'm not you	Men sen däl
This is not a problem at all.	Bu düýbünden mesele däl.
Here it is today.	Ine, şu gün.
I was fine with that.	Men muňa gowy boldum.
He didn't even call.	Ol hatda jaň etmedi.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
This is also strange for me.	Bu hem meniň üçin geň.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
This cannot be done.	Muny edip bolmaz.
There will never be enough money for them.	Olar üçin hiç wagt ýeterlik pul bolmaz.
He wanted to do the same.	Edil şol bir zady etmek isledi.
This allowed us.	Bu bize mümkinçilik berdi.
I agree with that.	Men bu pikir bilen razy bolaryn.
That's what happened to me once.	Bir gezek maňa şeýle boldy.
Many	Köp.
No one likes it.	Hiç kim ony halamaýar.
This and nothing else.	Bu we başga hiç zat ýok.
You are the best	Sen iň gowy.
I saw him thinking about it.	Men onuň bu hakda pikir edýändigini gördüm.
He wanted to do it.	Ol muny etjek boldy.
He said this.	Ol muny aýtdy.
Tonight	Bu gije.
There was no other way.	Bu ýerde başga ýol ýokdy.
There must be something.	Bir zat bolmaly.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
I didn't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däldim.
This may still be the case.	Bu entek hem bolup biler.
Someone can say something.	Kimdir biri bir zat aýdyp biler.
Of course, this is the case.	Elbetde, bu mesele.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
What a bad thing this is.	Bu nähili erbet zat.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
There were other things.	Başga zatlar hem bardy.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
He came back.	Ol gaýdyp geldi.
This week and next week.	Bu hepde we indiki hepde.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň zat.
I still will.	Men henizem ederin.
Last time.	Iň soňky gezek.
Not the smartest idea.	Iň akylly pikir däl.
The police have yet to arrest anyone.	Polisiýa entek hiç kimi tussag etmeli däl.
He is not even close.	Ol hatda ýakyn hem däl.
Everyone knows the truth.	Her bir adam hakykaty bilýär.
Everyone is different.	Her bir adam başga.
We can only be here.	Biz diňe şu ýerde bolup bileris.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
he thought.	diýip pikir etdi.
One has to do it for oneself.	Adam muny özi üçin etmeli.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
We still need it.	Bize henizem gerek.
I couldn't sleep last night.	Düýn gije uklap bilmedim.
Seems like a good idea.	Gowy pikir ýaly bolup görünýär.
I tried it for the first time yesterday.	Düýn ilkinji gezek synap gördüm.
You have to give him some credit.	Oňa birneme karz bermeli.
I have to be short.	Men gysga bolmaly.
Very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly.
It works well.	Gowy iş edýär.
He was not as human as last week.	Ol geçen hepde ýaly adam däldi.
Of course, he didn't.	Elbetde, ol beýle etmedi.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
It may even disappear.	Ol hatda ýok bolmagy hem mümkin.
It's been a long time.	Köp wagt boldy.
He did not know why.	Näme üçin bilmedi.
She is really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy.
I thought it was good.	Gowy diýip pikir etdim.
he said.	ol aýtdy.
It was a bad day.	Bu onuň erbet güni boldy.
Really good idea.	Hakykatdanam gowy pikir.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
It's hard to see.	Muny görmek kyn.
There is a way to his house.	Onuň öýüne bir ýol bar.
And then it would be.	Soň bolsa şeýle bolardy.
This seems strange to me.	Bu meniň üçin geň görünýär.
I told you so.	Men saňa bu hakda aýtdym.
I care about them.	Men olar hakda alada edýärin.
He will come to you.	Ol saňa geler.
And then he just told me what to do.	Soň bolsa diňe maňa näme etmelidigini aýtdy.
I can't be that smart.	Men beýle akylly bolup bilemok.
It was two.	Iki boldy.
He did not say anything about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat aýtmady.
I got one.	Men birini aldym.
There is someone.	Kimdir biri bar.
You don't have to talk about it.	Bu hakda gürleşmek hökman däl.
And then we.	Soň bolsa biz.
Who is he	Ol kim.
The answer was good.	Jogap gowy boldy.
One person can do it.	Bir adam edip biler.
This is about me.	Bu men hakda.
It's not like I'm the one who did it.	Bu işi eden meniň özüm ýaly däl.
This is not surprising.	Bu gaty geň däl.
There should be more.	Has köp zat bolmaly.
The time will come.	Wagty geler.
I don't want to be here.	Men bu ýerde bolmak islämok.
Everyone.	Hemmeler.
I don't know anything else	Men başga zady bilemok
It would have to go.	Bu gitmeli bolardy.
It won't happen later.	Soň bolmaz.
To get it.	Ony almak üçin.
What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Bu nähili gowy iş.
It was short.	Ol gysga boldy.
Tonight	Şu gije.
He did not know himself.	Ol özüni bilmeýärdi.
I want to be beautiful.	Men owadan bolmak isleýärin.
He didn't have to.	Ol bolmaly däldi.
How was that?	Bu nähili boldy.
He allowed it.	Ol rugsat berdi.
He helped me a lot.	Ol maňa köp kömek etdi.
Now you can only tell me.	Indi diňe maňa aýdyp bilersiňiz.
It was for me.	Ol meniň üçin boldy.
This is not a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat däl.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.

This can also be easy.	Bu hem aňsat bolup biler.
More	Has köp.
How can this be?	Bu nähili bolup biler?
It's hard to do that.	Muny etmek kyn.
He didn't think much of it.	Ol hakda kän pikir etmedi.
We have to do this.	Biz bu işi etmeli.
And he knew in that look that he was in for a treat.	We munuň munuň ony has köp isleýändigini bilýärdi.
One year he had a really good guy.	Bir ýyl hakykatdanam gowy ýigit bardy.
I immediately got one.	Men derrew birini aldym.
I think he's smart.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol akylly.
Now for you	Häzir seniň üçin
He never wanted to be.	Ol hiç wagt bolmak islemedi.
He is nothing to me anymore.	Ol meniň üçin indi hiç zat däl.
There was no question about it.	Bu barada hiç hili sorag ýokdy.
You have to do that.	Şeýle etmeli.
It really does seem to be there.	Hakykatdanam ol ýerde bar ýaly.
I could never tell.	Men hiç haçan aýdyp bilmedim.
For many people.	Köp adam üçin.
No one in that house was good.	Şol öýde hiç kim gowy däldi.
I am human.	Men adam.
He disappeared completely.	Ol düýbünden ýok boldy.
I didn't want to.	Men islemedim.
It almost happened.	Bu diýen ýaly boldy.
No news.	Habar ýok.
This is a great opportunity.	Bu uly mümkinçilik.
I didn't think I'd be here this morning.	Irden bu ýerde bolaryn öýdemokdym.
I know, smart.	Bilýärin, akylly.
He wanted it and took it away.	Ol ony isledi, alyp gitdi.
It just so happened.	Bu diňe şeýle boldy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Need more.	Has köp zat gerek.
This is about us.	Bu biz hakda.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.

I think this will be the case.	Bu mesele bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
I really know that.	Men muny hakykatdanam bilýärin.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
He decided to do it.	Ol bu barada karar berdi.
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
Actually a little too much.	Aslynda birneme köp.
I didn't think much of it.	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmedim.
There is no money, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Pul ýok "-diýdi.
Bar.	Bar.
He does what he wants to do.	Etjek bolýan zadyny edýär.
Will be back to get more.	Has köp zat almak üçin gaýdyp geler.
It will be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolar.
In fact, the idea was not new.	Aslynda bu pikir täze däldi.
She thought like a girl.	Ol gyz ýaly pikir etdi.
To get you	Seni almak üçin
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň, bagyşlaň.
I was not ready for that.	Men muňa beýle taýyn däldim.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
One can hope !.	Biri umyt edip biler!.
I didn't really do much.	Men hakykatdanam kän zat etmedim.
Something strange about them.	Olar hakda birneme geň zat.
In fact, it is strange.	Aslynda bu geň.
She seems to know a lot about that girl.	Şol gyz hakda köp zat bilýän ýaly.
They are not the only ones.	Olar diňe bir däl.
This is work.	Bu iş.
This is very difficult for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty kyn.
I'm not very good.	Men gaty gowy däl.
Once he helped us.	Bir gezek bize kömek etdi.
Each.	Her biri.
Next summer.	Indiki tomus.
I didn’t help the police much.	Men polisiýa kän bir kömek etmedim.
I care about myself.	Men özüm hakda alada edýärin.
Because it's bad.	Sebäbi ol erbet.
Money was nothing.	Pul hiç zat däldi.
I don't think it's there yet.	Entek ol ýerde bar öýdemok.
And he took the money with him.	We özi bilen pul aldy.
He did the only thing he could do.	Etjek bolýan ýeke-täk zadyny etdi.
He thought nothing of it.	Ol bu hakda başga hiç zat pikir etmedi.
What a thing.	Haýsy zat.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
To be with him.	Onuň bilen bolmak.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
There is no question about that.	Bu barada hiç hili sorag ýok.
I said it would be.	Boljakdygyny aýtdym.
I never saw him.	Hiç haçan ony görmedim.
He does the same.	Ol hem şeýle edýär.
Money can only get you so much.	Pul diňe size köp zat alyp biler.
You are beautiful	Sen ajaýyp
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
I don’t think he paid enough attention to it.	Oňa ýeterlik üns bermedi öýdýän.
He told us what to do.	Ol bize näme etjekdigini aýtdy.
There has to be a better way.	Has gowy ýol bolmaly.
That could be a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat bolup biler.
He wants to be someone else.	Ol başga adam bolmak isleýär.
Often this doesn't seem to be the case anymore.	Köplenç bu indi beýle däl ýaly bolup görünýär.
About it.	Bu hakda.
No problem.	Hiç hili mesele ýok.
What happened to him?	Oňa näme boldy?
He is now.	Ol şu wagt.
He did not answer me immediately.	Ol derrew maňa jogap bermedi.
There is no right way.	Dogry ýol ýok.
Need help? 	Kömek gerek?
I gave it to him.	Men oňa berdim.

Before that.	Mundan has öň.
It really does.	Bu hakykatdanam edýär.
The answer is still no.	Jogap henizem ýok.
He was there.	Ol bardy.
That's enough for me.	Bu meniň üçin ýeterlik.
Really, really	Hakykatdanam, hakykatdanam
I did nothing.	Men hiç zat etmedim.
He didn't think about it.	Ol bu barada pikir etmedi.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
He could not decide.	Ol karar berip bilmedi.
He did not know what had happened to him.	Ol özüne näme bolandygyny bilmeýärdi.
This is not a bad thing.	Bu gaty erbet däl.
He told you that you could tell me.	Maňa aýdyp bilersiňiz diýip, size aýtdy.
There was another reason.	Başga bir sebäp bardy.
He does it.	Ol muny edýär.
How interesting!	Nähili gyzykly!
I have a very good idea.	Mende gaty gowy pikir bar.
It seemed like a good idea.	Gowy pikir ýalydy.
They are everywhere.	Olar hemme ýerde.
He didn't know how to do it.	Muny nädip bilýändigini bilmeýärdi.
This man wants something.	Bu adam bir zat isleýär.
You don't think so.	Siziň pikiriňizçe, ol ýok.
This is different.	Bu başga.
Because you are not	Sebäbi sen däl
It made me crazy.	Bu meni däli etdi.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
Not too much.	Gaty kän däl.
It will be the same for you.	Bu hem siziň üçin şeýle bolar.
If only one thing.	Diňe bir zat bolsa.
Everyone was really good.	Her kim hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
He was always there.	Elmydama bardy.
There was nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýokdy.
It's a long way off.	Bu uzak ýol.
I have to go.	Men gitmeli adam.
I had.	Mende bardy.
He can.	Ol biler.
He could not.	Ol edip bilmedi.
It was great.	Gaty gowy boldy.
We need this for a big issue.	Bize gerek, bu uly mesele üçin.
There was enough hope for two people.	Iki adam üçin ýeterlik umyt bardy.
There was one.	Biri bardy.
Tom didn't answer.	Tom jogap bermedi.
He thought the song was about him.	Bu aýdym onuň hakda, diýip pikir etdi.
Couldn't think of a better life.	Gowy durmuş hakda pikir edip bilmedi.
You will be wonderful.	Ajaýyp bolarsyňyz.
I heard it.	Men ony eşitdim.
Then do something.	Soň bir zatlar et.
There is no good work here.	Bu ýerde gowy iş ýok.
He wanted it.	Ol muny isledi.
That would be nice.	Bu gowy bolardy.
I am single now.	Men häzirki wagtda ýeke.
This or that is nothing.	Bu ýa-da hiç zat däl.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
I can't sleep another night.	Başga bir gije uklap bilemok.
I think there is a problem here.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýerde bir mesele bar.
Because you are so beautiful.	Sebäbi sen şeýle ajaýyp.
No talking to that guy.	Ol ýigit bilen gürleşmek ýok.
This is an opportunity.	Bu bir mümkinçilik.
That's right- this is not about me.	Ol hem gaty dogry.
This is not true for me.	Bu maňa dogry däl.
This is too young for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty ýaş.
Like new.	Täze ýaly.
He will return.	Ol gaýdyp geler.
They are different.	Olar başga.
How am I there?	Men ol ýerde nähili
I couldn't do that with you.	Muny seniň bilen edip bilmedim.
It’s not a good thing to be right now.	Häzirki wagtda bolmak gowy zat däl.
I doubt it could be.	Mümkin bolup biljekdigine şübhelenýärin.
Bad and good.	Erbet we gowy.
You are a very good person.	Sen gaty gowy adam.
This is also a lie.	Bu hem ýalan.
This is not a new issue.	Bu täze mesele däl.
It was here before.	Bu ýerde öňem bardy.
Very good for you	Siziň üçin gaty gowy
Like me, today.	Meniň ýaly, şu gün.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda bu şeýle.
He is just like you and me.	Ol edil sen we meniň ýaly.
I don't have to.	Men hökman däl.
I owe him	Oňa karz
It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
This is worse.	Bu has erbet.
I had to be with someone.	Men kimdir biri bilen bolmaly boldum.
The book is very interesting.	Kitap gaty gyzykly.
I need more.	Maňa has köp gerek.
I didn't do it well.	Men oňa gowy iş etmedim.
He couldn't think.	Ol pikir edip bilmedi.
I can hope!	Men umyt edip bilerin!
For money.	Pul üçin.
Strangely enough.	Geň zat diýen ýaly.
We are very good together.	Biz bilelikde gaty gowy.
Sorry, there are two questions.	Bagyşlaň, iki sorag bar.
Good, but we're here.	Gowy, ýöne biz şu ýerde.
A guy	Bir ýigit.
He is someone else.	Ol başga biri.
That's not the case there.	Ol ýerde beýle däl.
Okay, we need more help.	Bolýar, bize has köp kömek gerek.
Next time, maybe.	Indiki gezek, belki.
Then, two weeks later, we're here.	Soň, iki hepde soň, biz şu ýerde.
You can see it for yourself.	Muny özüňiz görüp bilersiňiz.
What is this	Bu näme?
Everyone.	Hemmeler.
It wasn't even easy.	Bu hatda aňsat däldi.
I don't like it	Men ony halamok
I'm not questioning that.	Men muny sorag etmeýärin.
Please? 	Haýyş edýärin?
I need you	Siz maňa gerek.
Here he is, taking me.	Ine, meni aldy.
.He came out	.Ol çykdy
He doesn't want to talk.	Ol gürleşmek islemeýär.
Faster, faster.	Has çalt, has çalt.
He didn't let me go.	Ol maňa hiç zat bilen gitmäge ýol bermedi.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
I want something to worry about.	Alada etmeli bir zat isleýärin.
They are interesting.	Olar gyzykly.
The two are very close.	Bu ikisi gaty ýakyn.
.	.
He said this.	Ol muny aýtdy.
I never saw it.	Hiç haçan görmedim.
I was not really myself.	Men hakykatdanam özüm däldim.
I didn't know how to do it.	Men muny nädip bilýändigini bilmeýärdim.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
It can be difficult.	Kyn bolup biler.
He arrived a little early.	Ol birneme ir geldi.
Maybe not for you, but for me.	Belki seniň üçin däl, meniň üçin.
It would be better.	Bu has gowy bolardy.
Okay, that's interesting.	Bolýar, bu gyzykly.
We have to hope.	Biz umyt etmeli.
I may or may not agree.	Men razy bolup bilerin ýa-da bolmaz.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
He knows very serious things.	Ol gaty çynlakaý zatlary bilýär.
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
The question is, of course, when.	Sorag, elbetde, haçan.
I have nothing	Mende hiç zat ýok
I could be crazy.	Men däli bolup bilerin.
OK, but it wasn't.	Bolýar, ýöne beýle däldi.
Maybe another time.	Belki başga bir gezek.
It took a long time.	Uzak wagt aldy.
I didn't have to say that.	Muny aýtmaly däldi.
No one did.	Hiç kim etmedi.
He started talking, but the man didn't let her.	Ol gürläp başlady, ýöne adam oňa rugsat bermedi.
He calls me.	Ol maňa jaň edýär.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
No need anymore.	Indi zerur däl.
It's hard to say why he didn't.	Näme üçin beýle etmedi, muny aýtmak kyn.
There is so much for you today.	Bu gün siziň üçin köp zatlar bar.
He has.	Ol bar.
I couldn't do anything else.	Başga bir zat edip bilmedim.
There is a good reason for this.	Munuň gowy sebäbi bar.
Not really good or bad.	Aslynda doly ýa-da gowy däl.
It is impossible to do so.	Muny etmek mümkin däl.
He didn't want to.	Derrew islemedi.
Not next week.	Indiki hepde ýok.
Ol.	Ol.
He is so serious.	Ol şeýle bir çynlakaý.
Why would he do that?	Näme üçin beýle eder?
I still do.	Men henizem şeýle.
This man.	Bu adam.
In fact, he didn't say much.	Aslynda ol beýle kän zat aýtmady.
I am very happy about that.	Men muňa gaty begenýärin.
I think we should do this together.	Muny bilelikde etmeli diýip pikir edýärin.
It's something else.	Ol başga zat.
No one but me knows.	Menden başga hiç kim bilenok.
There is something.	Bir zat bar.
I do not know.	Men bilemok.
This is bad.	Bu erbet.
It was good to see.	Görmek gowy boldy.
Long way to go.	Uzak ýol.
It can't be good.	Gowy bolup bilmez.
Not a good thing.	Gowy zat däl.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
Someone else will.	Başga biri hem eder.
There was something he wanted to see.	Boljakdygyny görmek isleýän zady bardy.
He calls us.	Bize jaň edýär.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Not much, maybe.	Köp däl, belki.
As before.	Öňküsi ýaly.
I have seen this issue once.	Bu meseläni bir gezek gördüm.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili erbet zat ýok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu ýerde bolmaly.
It has been strange for months.	Birnäçe aý bäri geň galdy.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
That's all.	Bu hemme zat.
This is really the case for me.	Bu, hakykatdanam, meniň üçin.
Many people did.	Köp adam etdi.
It was a good idea.	Gowy pikir boldy.
It's not me.	Bu men däl.
Not here.	Bu ýerde ýok.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu ýok.
That's a lot.	Bu hakykatdanam köp bolýar.
There is a problem.	Mesele bar.
And so it is.	Bu hem şeýle.
This is not for me.	Bu meniň üçin däl.
It was very difficult to see him there.	Ony şol ýerde görmek gaty kyn boldy.
I really don't believe this will happen.	Munuň boljakdygyna hakykatdanam ynanamok.
And still nothing.	We henizem hiç zat ýok.
Lots, lots of things.	Köp, köp zat.
Of course, this is not the case for me.	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin däl.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
She is beautiful.	Ol gyz owadan.
No one asked questions.	Hiç kim sorag bermedi.
I don't know when that happened.	Men munuň haçan bolandygyny bilemok.
I didn’t always know how to do it.	Hemişe etmegi bilmeýärdim.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Belki bu gowy zat.
How did he do that?	Muny nädip etdi?
They don’t even exist.	Olar hatda ýok.
This is great	Bu ajaýyp
He was not there yesterday.	Ol düýn ýokdy.
Whatever.	Näme bar bolsa.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
It was really good.	Aslynda gowy boldy.
We are almost here.	Biz şu ýerde diýen ýaly.
It's just fun to say.	Diňe aýtmak gyzykly.
Tomorrow is a long day.	Ertir uzak gün.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Probably not.	Mümkin beýle däl bolsa gerek.
What can you see there? 	Ol ýerde näme görüp bilersiňiz?
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Great food.	Gaty gowy nahar.
She was worried.	Ony biynjalyk etdi.
Not so.	Şeýle hem däl.
He knows everything about it.	Ol bu hakda hemme zady bilýär.
I agreed to do that.	Men muny etmäge razy boldum.
He is not stupid.	Ol samsyk däl.
That day	Şol gün.
Okay, maybe he will and maybe he won’t.	Bolýar, belki eder we belki bolmaz.
Now life must be like this.	Indi durmuş şeýle bolmaly.
For several years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri.
He is a very young man.	Ol gaty ýigit.
He said he did not know why he did so.	Näme üçin beýle edendigini bilmeýändigini aýtdy.
You know, good for me.	Bilýärsiň, sen meniň üçin gowy.
He called me.	Maňa jaň etdi.
Because we are not.	Sebäbi biz beýle däl.
We can hope.	Umyt edip bileris.
No one told me.	Hiç kim maňa aýtmady.
I can't speak for everyone.	Men hemmeler üçin gürläp bilemok.
I am the one who should be with you.	Men seniň bilen bolmaly adam.
No one could take us so fast.	Hiç kim bizi beýle çalt alyp bilmedi.
No one else knows.	Başga hiç kim bilmez.
I didn't know what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilmedim.
That can't be a smart idea.	Bu akylly pikir ýaly bolup bilmez.
How is that	Bu nähili.
Like last week.	Geçen hepde ýaly.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
No one needs that kind of money.	Hiç kime beýle pul gerek däl.
You are not like me	Sen meniň ýaly däl
It was evening.	Agşam boldy.
A lot of money.	Köp pul.
He was there.	Ol ýerde bardy.
Interesting opportunity, but not so.	Gyzykly mümkinçilik, ýöne beýle däl.
Why not?	Näme üçin beýle däl?
It helped me.	Bu maňa kömek etdi.
About many things.	Köp zatlar hakda.
What happened?	Bu näme boldy.
I think there must be time for them.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar üçin wagt bolmaly.
She didn't have to tell him.	Oňa aýtmaly däldi.
There really was no other option.	Hakykatdanam başga mümkinçilik ýokdy.
This is the answer.	Bu jogap.
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Interesting, but there is still a problem.	Gyzykly, ýöne henizem bir mesele bar.
He told us.	Ol bize aýtdy.
Almost everyone.	Hemmeler diýen ýaly.
And now here it is.	Indi bolsa şu ýerde.
Much more could be done.	Has köp zat edip bolardy.
Not just one, many.	Diňe bir däl, köp.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
He just wants to help.	Ol diňe kömek etjek bolýar.
Neither was.	Ikisi-de ýokdy.
These are good things.	Bu gowy zatlar.
Now everyone had work to do.	Indi her kimiň etmeli işi bardy.
I don't think that's enough.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýeterlik däl.
He was like a good man.	Ol gowy adam ýalydy.
He said.	Ol şeýle diýdi.
This will be an issue.	Bu mesele bolar.
Nothing else can happen.	Başga hiç zat bolup bilmez.
I thought he would be very happy.	Ol gaty bagtly bolar öýdüpdim.
This is strange.	Bu geň ýerde.
It's really beautiful.	Bu hakykatdanam owadan.
He was very good to me.	Ol maňa gaty gowy boldy.
Of course, this is not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däl.
Why is that?	Näme üçin beýle bolýar?
He got it.	Ol aldy.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
You have to do something.	Bir zat etmeli.
He is with me.	Ol meniň bilen.
Not too bad, really.	Gaty erbet däl, hakykatdanam.
No matter how bad it is.	Bu näçe erbet bolsa.
That's the way life is.	Durmuş şeýle.
No need to work.	Iş gerek däl.
Good day	Gowy gün.
That can't be the other way around.	Bu siziň üçin başga ýol bolup bilmez.
To be with him.	Onuň bilen bolmak.
He will not be against you.	Ol size garşy bolmaz.
I think it can help you.	Size kömek edip biler öýdýän.
This is not it!	Bu däl!
I think that could be the problem.	Bu mesele bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
Now the problem.	Indi mesele.
There are two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar.
I said that.	Men muny aýtdym.
Police are questioning him.	Polisiýa ony sorag edýär.
How is that	Bu nähili?
That would be true.	Bu dogry bolar.
You have to do bad things.	Erbet zatlar etmeli.
Everyone wants to help him.	Her kim oňa kömek etmek isleýär.
I don’t know how to do that.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilemok.
There must be someone else.	Başga biri bolmaly.
This was not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däldi.
Of course it will be.	Elbetde şeýle bolar.
No wonder there.	Ol ýerde geň zat ýok.
A little	Biraz.
There were several.	Birnäçe bardy.
I just want to go	Men diňe gitmek isleýärin
Something is left.	Bir zat galdy.
Gone.	Gitdi.
I don't like it there	Men ol ýerde halamok
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gaty dogry zat.
It will not take long.	Munuň üçin köp wagt gerek bolmaz.
He said.	Ol şeýle diýdi.
I make it one, it makes me one.	Men ony bir edýärin, ol meni bir edýär.
Existence only.	Diňe bar bolmak.
Not such a big deal.	Beýle uly mesele däl.
That would be a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk bolar.
There was plenty of time to be together.	Bile bolmak üçin köp wagt bardy.
For himself or for himself.	Özi ýa-da özi üçin.
What time is it?	Sagat näçe?
He did what he did.	Ol edenini etdi.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
He did not know.	Ol bilmedi.
Right here.	Edil şu ýerde.
This year is bigger.	Bu ýyl has uly.
I'm here and there.	Men şu ýerde we ol ýerde.
That was not the question.	Bu sorag däldi.
And no one has to.	Şeýle hem hiç kim etmeli däl.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
Can anyone help me?	Maňa kömek edip biljek barmy?
It doesn't seem to be there.	Ol ýerde ýok ýaly.
There is a problem here.	Bu ýerde mesele bar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu sen we muny bilýärsiň.
They are not for me.	Olar meniň üçin däl.
These are two for me.	Bu meniň üçin iki.
I am not a police officer.	Men polisiýa däl.
It's time.	Wagt boldy.
He is like everyone else.	Ol hemmeler ýaly.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Muny diňe bir gezek etmeli.
I allowed myself to be taken away.	Men özümi alyp gitmäge rugsat berdim.
Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
I am here.	Men şu ýerde.
It was a good day.	Gowy gün boldy.
Just then there was a loud noise.	Edil şol wagt gaty ses çykdy.
This is a completely different person.	Bu düýbünden başga biri.
I can't see everything.	Men hemme zady görüp bilemok.
He wanted to do it right.	Ony dogry etmek isledi.
This is his last job.	Bu onuň soňky işi.
This is really happening in a very short time.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gysga wagtda bolýar.
This is often the case.	Köplenç bu.
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
This is certainly true.	Bu, elbetde, dogry.
What is this	Bu näme.
He also went with someone.	Ol hem kimdir biri bilen gitdi.
He was not once.	Ol bir gezek däldi.
What a good idea.	Nähili gowy pikir.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
I'm fine now.	Men eýýäm gowy boldum.
He knows.	Ol bilýär.
No one is so beautiful.	Hiç bir adam beýle owadan däl.
We are the worst	Biz iň erbet
It came out later.	Soň çykdy.
A word	Bir söz.
They are nothing.	Olar hiç zat däl.
I couldn't see it that way.	Men ony beýle görüp bilmedim.
Surprised.	Geň galdy.
It's been a long time coming.	Uzak ýol boldy.
Call him.	Oňa jaň etmek.
"I'm sorry."	Bagyşlaň "diýdi.
There were good things.	Gowy zatlar bardy.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
Help me	Maňa kömek et
He wanted to say more.	Has köp zat aýtmak isledi.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
We are very close to him.	Biz oňa gaty ýakyn.
I had enough.	Mende ýeterlik zat bardy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu akylly pikir.
He can hope again tomorrow.	Ertir ýene umyt edip biler.
In the morning.	Irden.
OK, you can.	Bolýar, edip bilersiňiz.
I can tell you too.	Size hem aýdyp bilerin.
I can see it there.	Men ony şol ýerde görüp bilýärin.
Time does it.	Wagt muny edýär.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
A week later.	Bir hepde soň.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
She looked pretty.	Ol ýeterlik owadan ýalydy.
I'm going to do this.	Men bu zady etjek.
Not many people come here.	Bu ýere köp adam gelenok.
Tell me later.	Menden soň aýdyň.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
No other way.	Başga ýol däl.
Really happy.	Hakykatdanam bagtly.
He called me.	Ol maňa jaň etdi.
This is it.	Bu bolsa.
I can't do it anymore	Indi edip bilemok
No more.	Indi ýok.
He said no, he couldn't do that.	Ol ýok, ýok, muny edip bilmedi diýdi.
He often does.	Ol köplenç şeýle edýär.
I think that's the way it is for money.	Meniň pikirimçe, pul üçin bu ýol.
This life seemed very long.	Bu durmuş gaty uzak ýalydy.
I want it	Men ony isleýärin
There are only two ways.	Diňe iki ýol bar.
And right now, we seem to be there.	Şu wagt bolsa, biz bar ýaly.
Everyone is against us.	Hemmeler bize garşy.
This is a great job.	Bu ajaýyp iş.
I want it so bad.	Men beýle erbet isleýärin.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
I did nothing wrong.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedim.
Maybe one day, but not yet.	Belki bir gün, ýöne entek ýok.
I'm not interested.	Men gyzykly däl.
Not enough time.	Wagt ýeterlik däl.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
As it was two years ago.	Iki ýyl öňküsi ýaly.
I will never be ready.	Men hiç wagt taýyn bolmaz.
I'm not going to do that.	Men muny etjek däl.
One reason is that we do not need it.	Munuň bir sebäbi, bize gerek däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň üçin munuň özi bar.
You can do something else.	Başga bir zat edip bilersiňiz.
Maybe it's just me.	Belki diňe men.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
I don't need money	Maňa pul gerek däl
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe bir zat.
No work.	Iş ýok.
It could be the same.	Şeýle hem bolup biler.
She must be happy.	Ol bagtly bolmaly.
It's great to be here.	Bu ýerde bolmagy gaty gowy.
Here's what happened.	Ine, näme boldy.
I'm better now.	Men häzir has gowy.
There was no other reason.	Başga bir sebäp ýokdy.
"Everything is happening," he said.	"Bolýan zatlar bolýar" -diýdi.
Big guy	Uly ýigit.
Just not enough.	Diňe ýeterlik däl.

It will be here.	Bu ýerde bolar.
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat.
It wasn't him.	Bu ol däldi.
Excuse me, please.	Bagyşlaň, haýyş edýärin.
By the way, this is a bad thing.	Söz, bu erbet zat.
He can answer me.	Ol maňa jogap berip biler.
It's easy to be good.	Gowy bolmak gaty aňsat.
This is my last.	Bu meniň iň soňky.
That was not the case before.	Ozal beýle däldi.
Until last week.	Geçen hepde çenli.
This man.	Bu adam.
And then we.	Soň bolsa biz.
I had enough.	Mende ýeterlik zat bardy.
It has been a wonderful week.	Bu ajaýyp hepde boldy.
He's just a guy.	Ol diňe ýigit.
It's not about me.	Bu men hakda däl.
She is a girl.	Ol gyz.
So it will be interesting.	Şonuň üçin bu gyzykly bolar.
Then a hundred more.	Soň ýene ýüz.
Do well	Gowy et.
You don't have to go there.	Ol ýere gitmeli däl.
It won't be fast.	Çalt bolmaz.
We can't agree.	Biz razy bolup bilmeris.
I didn't think so.	Beýle diýip pikir etmedim.
Not anymore.	Indi däl.
I never had to.	Men hiç haçan etmeli däldim.
He rested.	Dynç aldy.
There is no reason to do that yet.	Muny entek etmäge hiç hili sebäp ýok.
It was not there before.	Bu ýerde öň ýokdy.
He sang to her.	Ol oňa aýdym aýtdy.
Both will.	Ikisi hem eder.
It would be nice tonight.	Bu gije gowy bolardy.
It was really hard for me.	Bu meniň üçin hakykatdanam kyn boldy.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
Okay.	Bolýar.
It happened every day.	Her gün boldy.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
I can	Edip bilýän
No one wanted these things.	Hiç kim bu zatlary islemedi.
I have to go now	Men indi gitmeli
Who knows what happened.	Näme bolandygyny kim bilýär.
This is a big challenge for us today.	Bu gün biziň bilen bu uly kynçylyk.
We can't go anywhere today.	Bu gün hiç ýere gidip bilmeris.
They are there.	Olar ol ýerde.
I can be with anyone and everything.	Her kim we hemme zat bilen bile bolup bilýärin.
So now you can think of one.	Şonuň üçin indi biri hakda pikir edip bilersiňiz.
There is a possible concern.	Bolup biljek alada bar.
He thought it was a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir etdi.
I really don't know why.	Näme üçin hakykatdanam bilemok.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
What next.	Indiki näme hakda.

He is here tonight.	Ol şu gije şu ýerde.
Do something	Bir zatlar et.
I have no such thing	Mende beýle zat ýok
Money helped, but it was not the only thing.	Pul kömek etdi, ýöne bu ýekeje zat däldi.
We have to do this for everyone.	Muny hemmeler üçin etmeli.
That's right.	Gaty dogry.
What's up 	Näme bolýar?

It's too early in the evening.	Agşam gaty ir.
The message was short.	Habar gysga boldy.
They are good with it.	Olar munuň bilen gowy.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilmez.
Of course, that was not the case.	Elbetde, beýle zat däldi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Muny etmegiň wagty geldi.
I knew better now.	Men indi has gowy bilýärdim.
We don't even know what happened to you.	Saňa näme bolandygyny hatda bilmeris.
Will definitely be back.	Elbetde gaýdyp geler.
He said.	Diýdi.
Everyone is different.	Hemmeler başga.

Why is he 	Näme üçin ol?
Of course, this is great.	Elbetde, bu gaty gowy.
At the time, he was not worried.	Şol wagt ol biynjalyk däldi.
It will be big.	Uly bolar.
There is nothing against it.	Oňa garşy hiç zat ýok.
No one else can.	Başga hiç kim edip bilmez.
He can't think of anything to offer.	Ol teklip etjek hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilmez.
I didn't know what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilmedim.
He knows nothing, of course, very young.	Ol hiç zady bilmeýär, elbetde, gaty ýaş.
I do this often.	Men muny köplenç edýärin.
Time is short, but it can be done.	Wagt gysga, ýöne edip bolýar.
He said there was something we needed to talk to.	Ol biziň bilen gürleşmek üçin zerur bir zadyň bardygyny aýtdy.
Really?	Hakykatdanam?
It's about you.	Ol sen hakda.
How could he not say.	Nädip aýdyp bilmedi.
Two, maybe three years.	Iki, belki üç ýyl.
Not two, not three.	Iki däl, üç däl.
I did not see	Men görmedim
This is not very good.	Bu gaty gowy däl.
I think someone else said it best.	Başga bir adam muny iň gowy aýtdy diýip pikir edýärin.
There was an opportunity.	Bu mümkinçilik bardy.
The time was short.	Wagt gysga boldy.
It was not.	Bu ýokdy.
I've only seen it a few times.	Men ony diňe birnäçe gezek gördüm.
Well, he said again.	Gowy, ýene aýtdy.

This is difficult for many people.	Bu köp adam üçin kyn.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç bir ýerde ýeterlik zat ýok.
Not too big.	Gaty uly däl.
The timing was great.	Wagty gaty gowy boldy.
There was nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.

Then he gave it to me.	Soň bolsa ony maňa berdi.
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It was not difficult.	Bu kyn däldi.
To be human.	Adam bolmak.

I'm right there.	Men edil şol ýerde.

It should be interesting.	Gyzykly bolmaly.
He wants to talk to you.	Ol siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýär.
This is really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty kyn.
She would be really beautiful.	Ol hakykatdanam owadan bolardy.

There was a big mistake today.	Bu gün uly ýalňyşlyk boldy.

This is the first time I've seen him.	Men ony ilkinji gezek gördüm.
I think that's a good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.

I'm not stupid	Men samsyk däl
This is not beautiful.	Bu owadan däl.
I was fine with them.	Men olar bilen gowy boldum.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
He responded immediately.	Ol derrew jogap berdi.
Everything is completely new.	Hemme zat düýbünden täze.
Never enough.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik däl.

Maybe I thought.	Belki pikir etdim.
A few days are a month.	Birnäçe gün bir aý bolýar.
This is a lot with me.	Bu meniň bilen köp bolýar.
He wanted to go now.	Ol indi gitmek isledi.

I really	Men hakykatdanam.
I can think of a way.	Men bir ýol hakda pikir edip bilerin.

They were not.	Olar beýle däldi.
The same is true here.	Bu ýerde edil şol bir zat.
I wanted to help.	Kömek etjek boldum.
He could not sleep last night.	Düýn agşam uklap bilmedi.

Everything seems very serious.	Hemme zat gaty çynlakaý görünýär.
He did very well.	Ol gaty gowy etdi.

He went too.	Ol hem gitdi.
We don't need that.	Bu bize gerek däl.
You are there	Sen şol ýerde
Not really good, but very bad.	Aslynda gaty gowy däl, ýöne gaty erbet.

There was no one else there.	Ol ýerde başga hiç kim ýokdy.
There is no one else like him.	Onuň ýaly başga biri ýok.
Not just today.	Diňe şu gün däl.
There was no one to help him.	Oňa kömek etjek hiç kim ýokdy.
I hope this doesn't happen to you.	Bu siziň üçin beýle bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
He is a really big man.	Ol hakykatdanam uly adam.
You have to rest.	Dynç almaly.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
It will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek bolar.

Police arrested him.	Polisiýa ony tussag etdi.
You will need it now.	Size indi gerek bolar.
Many	Köp.
He must be older than me.	Ol menden uly bolsa gerek.
Tell us this and you can go home.	Muny bize aýdyň we öýe gidip bilersiňiz.
I didn't see the time.	Men wagty görmedim.
That's a lot.	Bu köp boldy.
I can't do anything about it.	Men ol hakda hiç zat edip bilemok.
This can be very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly bolup biler.

This is a bigger man.	Bu has uly adam.
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.

The sun had risen, but he did not know.	Gün çykdy, ýöne bilmedi.
Couldn't be.	Bolup bilmedi.
He did not.	Etmedi.
Great idea.	Ajaýyp pikir.
I can say that.	Men muny aýdyp bilerin.
They have to be here.	Olar şu ýerde bolmaly.

It's only been a few weeks.	Diňe birnäçe hepde boldy.

Just like you	Edil seniň ýaly
Help came quickly.	Kömek çalt geldi.
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
He never said that.	Ol muny hiç haçan aýtmady.

It gave me a bit of a hint.	Bu maňa birneme habar berdi.
I think so too.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hem.
Life is beautiful!	Durmuş owadan!
Now he was like anyone else.	Häzir ol başga adam ýalydy.
OK, then do.	Bolýar, soň et.
He did it for me.	Ol meniň üçin etdi.

He is a very good man.	Ol gaty gowy adam.
It's fast and easy.	Bu çalt we aňsat.

There could be another way.	Başga bir ýol bolup biler.
Another person.	Başga bir adam.
I do this "I".	Muny "men" edýärin.
He knows that.	Ol muny bilýär.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
I did it.	Men muny etdim.
You are absolutely crazy.	Sen düýbünden däli.

He went to himself.	Ol özüne gitdi.
A meal, please.	Bir nahar, haýyş.
It's very easy to go.	Gitmek gaty aňsat.
He didn't have to pay attention.	Oňa üns bermeli däldi.
It's different, but not good.	Bu başga, ýöne gowy däl.
Then a few more days came and went.	Soň ýene birnäçe gün geldi we gitdi.
This is a great opportunity for you.	Bu siziň üçin uly mümkinçilik.

You are right now	Sen şu wagt
We are alone	Ikimiz ýeke.

We don't need a problem.	Bize kynçylyk gerek däl.
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
Every day here as before.	Bu ýerde her gün öňküsi ýaly.
I was never happy.	Men hiç wagt bagtly däldim.
This will help you.	Bu size kömek eder.
He lent me.	Ol maňa karz berdi.
I thought about it.	Ol hakda pikir etdim.
He does the same.	Edil şol bir zady edýär.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
This is a serious matter.	Bu has çynlakaý bir zat.
It was a close call.	Bu ýakyn jaň boldy.
Something better for us.	Biziň üçin has gowy zat.
I think here.	Bu ýerde pikir edýärin.
It's not that hard.	Aslynda beýle kyn däl.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
You have to tell him that.	Oňa muny aýtmaly.
I did the necessary things.	Zerur zatlary etdim.

Of course why?	Elbetde näme üçin?
This is not difficult for me.	Bu meniň üçin kyn däl.
That would always be the case.	Elmydama şeýle bolardy.
That would be the right thing to do.	Dogry zat bolardy.
He is a wonderful man.	Ol ajaýyp adam.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
Tell her what to do.	Oňa näme etmelidigini aýdyň.
He thought he knew.	Bilýändigini pikir etdi.

Two ways.	Iki ýol.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
A word	Bir söz.
It will one day.	Bu bir gün bolar.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
No one likes it.	Hiç kim ony halamaýar.
This is a new path.	Bu täze ýol.
You can borrow for two weeks.	Iki hepde karz alyp bolar.
There was no decision.	Karar ýokdy.
Big.	Uly.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
You can take me, or not.	Meni alyp bilersiňiz, ýa-da ýok.
He needs me.	Ol maňa mätäç.
It's a pleasure.	Bu bir lezzet.
This is not possible.	Bu iş mümkin däl.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
It could hurt me.	Ol maňa zyýan berip biler.
You will be fine.	Gowy bolarsyňyz.
He said he had.	Ol bardygyny aýtdy.
He will do the same.	Ol hem şeýle eder.

Need help.	Kömek bolmaly.
It's about having fun.	Bu hezil etmek hakda.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
I want to do the same.	Muny hem edil şonuň ýaly etmek isleýärin.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
I don't care about myself.	Men özüm hakda alada etmeýärin.
You know what it was like.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilýärsiň.
Because we can't do much about it.	Sebäbi bu hakda köp zat edip bilmeris.
Tell me this is not the case.	Munuň beýle däldigini aýdyň.
I knew nothing.	Men hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
It's fast.	Bu çalt.
It just exists.	Ol diňe bar.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
He will.	Ol eder.
I want it here.	Men ony şu ýerde isleýärin.
I am happy for him.	Men onuň üçin bagtly.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
He doesn't need it.	Oňa mätäç däl.
I have to go	Men gitmeli
I went and told him.	Men baryp, oňa aýtdym.
He does what he does well.	Her edenini gowy edýär.
Of course he knows.	Elbetde, bilýär.
I got it.	Men ony aldym.
I can still.	Men henizem mümkin.
Only one person can do that.	Muny diňe bir adam edip bilmez.
He was not here.	Bu ýerde ýokdy.
About everything.	Hemme zat hakda.
This is his job.	Bu onuň işi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, meni adam etjek zat.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, zatlar şeýle.
I think there is something wrong here.	Bu ýerde ýalňyşlyk bar diýip pikir edýärin.
I didn't even see him that night.	Şol gije ony hatda görmedim.
He thought you were crazy.	Ol sen hakda däli diýip pikir etdi.
What could happen	Näme bolup biler
There is a lot of money now.	Häzirki wagtda köp pul bar.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
That too.	Munuň hem bardygyny.

It seemed good.	Gowy ýalydy.
That was not the case.	Bu dogry zat däldi.
There is enough for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin ýeterlik zat bar.
He told me that morning.	Şol gün irden maňa aýtdy.
What else can he do?	Başga näme edip biler?
He didn't have to do that either.	Muny hem etmeli däldi.
He also admitted this.	Ol hem muny boýun aldy.
It was hard for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin kyn boldy.
He made the last call.	Iň soňky jaň etdi.
You are at home	Sen öýde.
I want you	Men seni isleýärin
He asked if he was alone.	Ol özüniň ýeke däldigini sorady.
He looks crazy.	Ol däli ýaly bolup görünýär.
Everything was not perfect.	Hemme zat ajaýyp däldi.
What a year.	Näme ýyl.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
These are two things.	Bu iki zat.
I can agree with that.	Men muňa razy bolup bilerin.
You can actually do that.	Aslynda muny edip bilersiňiz.
You are smart	Sen akylly.
They are a business.	Olar bir iş.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat ajaýyp.
I told him one last time.	Men oňa soňky gezek aýtdym.
We are very good.	Biz gaty gowy.
In fact, it was.	Aslynda bu boldy.
It will happen, it will definitely happen.	Bu bolar, hökman bolar.
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däl.
I tried.	Synap gördüm.
He really did.	Ol hakykatdanam etdi.
You can stop worrying about it.	Bu barada alada etmegi bes edip bilersiňiz.
He was very surprised.	Ol gaty geň galdy.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
Here they are.	Ine, olar.
The sooner the better.	Näçe ir bolsa gowy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil özi.
He said he could no longer do so.	Ol indi beýle zady edip bilmejekdigini aýtdy.
He likes it here.	Ol muny şu ýerde halaýar.
I'm worried about him.	Men ol hakda gaty alada edýärin.
There are actually a few.	Aslynda birnäçe.
Maybe he'll be back with her now.	Belki, indi onuň bilen gaýdyp geler.
He did not answer.	Ol oňa jogap bermedi.
How to do this?	Muny nädip etmeli?
I know you have.	Seniň bardygyny bilýärin.
Not long, but enough.	Uzak däl, ýöne ýeterlik.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
What did he say?	Ol näme diýdi.
I told her.	Men oňa aýtdym.
He seemed to be gone.	Ol ýok ýalydy.
It seemed like a good idea.	Iň gowy pikir ýalydy.
Of course, this is not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däl.
Not always easy.	Elmydama aňsat däl.
This is new for them.	Bu olar üçin täze.
They are completely false.	Olar düýbünden ýalan.
It was hard for me.	Bu meniň üçin kyn boldy.
I could not speak	Men gürläp bilmedim
No big deal was needed.	Uly zat gerek däldi.
You just have to be there.	Ol ýerde diňe sen bolmaly.
Nothing made me happy.	Hiç bir iş meni bagtly etmedi.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
In fact, they are completely different.	Aslynda olar düýbünden başga.
Not there.	Ol ýerde däl.
We need to help.	Bize kömek etmeli.
Good day	Gowy gün.
I know.	Men bilýärin.
Now or never!	Häzir ýa-da hiç haçan!

He could not see her in the morning and evening.	Irden agşam ony görüp bilmedi.
A really interesting book.	Hakykatdanam gyzykly kitap.
More	Has köp.
It was for me.	Bu meniň üçin boldy.

Very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly.
How is this possible?	Bu nädip mümkin bolup biler?
He knew that too.	Ol hem muny bilýärdi.
I will be here for two hours.	Men bu ýerde iki sagat bolaryn.
This was not the way.	Bu ýol däldi.
He thought he was there again.	Ol ýene şol ýerde diýip pikir etdi.
It seemed good with that.	Munuň bilen gowy ýalydy.
That's the way it is today.	Bu gün şeýle.
It seemed impossible.	Mümkin däl ýalydy.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
He should never be harmed.	Oňa hiç wagt zyýan bermeli däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Hakykatdanam, bu zerur zat.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle, ol gaty ses bilen aýtdy.
He tried to help her.	Oňa kömek etjek boldy.
That's the way life is.	Bütin durmuş şeýle.
Nothing can be done about it.	Bu barada hiç zat edip bolmaz.
It still exists.	Ol henizem bar.
Even.	Hatda.
If only there was one problem.	Diňe bir mesele bar bolsa.
Being busy does not necessarily make me happy.	Iş bilen meşgul bolmak meni hökman bagtly etmeýär.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
Why not? 	Näme üçin beýle däl?
I gave him everything.	Men oňa hemme zady berdim.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
It seems so bad.	Bu gaty erbet ýaly.
He knows nothing.	Ol hiç zady bilmeýär.
He could not help it.	Ol kömek edip bilmedi.
That's a lot.	Bu köp.
The same can be said here.	Bu ýerde hem şeýle bolup biler.
Nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýok.
They were not like me.	Olar meniň ýaly däldi.
That's what happened here.	Ine, şu ýerde näme boldy.
I hope it will be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolmaz.
Well, man.	Gowy, adam.
This is another day and so is another idea.	Bu başga bir gün we şonuň üçin başga bir pikir.
The man was right.	Ol adam dogry aýtdy.
This is good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy.
Not only that, man.	Diňe ýok, adam.
This is last week.	Bu geçen hepde.
That's what happens.	Şeýle zat bolýar.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
I think everyone should pay attention to themselves.	Meniň pikirimçe, her kim özüne üns bermeli.
He could not do it later.	Soň edip bilmedi.
Often a smart girl.	Köplenç akylly gyz.
Strange thing.	Geň zat.
She is as beautiful as pleasure.	Ol lezzet ýaly owadan.
I had no such thing.	Mende beýle zat ýokdy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu bir hili dogry.
That's a lot.	Bu köp zat.
Like you	Seniň ýaly
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
What a happy man he is.	Ol nähili bagtly adam.
There is a reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi bar.
I'm not very good at that.	Men muňa gaty gowy däl.
He really is.	Hakykatdanam ol.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmeli däl.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, beýle bolmaz.
Always about you	Elmydama sen hakda.
I want to help	Kömek etmek isleýärin
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
Just a few short.	Diňe birnäçe gysga.
I do not like	Men halamok
Now nothing else.	Indi başga hiç zat ýok.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
He came back at that time.	Şol wagt gaýdyp geldi.
I did it myself.	Men muny özüm etdim.
Not good, maybe.	Gowy däl, mümkin.
I made a big mistake.	Men oňa uly ýalňyşlyk etdim.
That's it.	Munuň özi.
He never had a job.	Onuň hiç wagt işi ýokdy.
Money is not a word.	Pul söz däl.
It must have happened before.	Oňa öňem bolup geçen bolmaly.

Don't come twice.	Iki gezek gelenok.
Wants to receive a message.	Habar almak isleýär.
The idea was not to think about it.	Bu pikir bu hakda pikir etmek däldi.

You have to go to school.	Mekdebe gitmeli.
She is beautiful.	Ol owadan.
Such a pleasure.	Şeýle lezzet.

I can't do more	Has köp zat edip bilemok
This is better.	Bu has gowy.
I want you alone.	Men seni ýeke özüm isleýärin.
How beautiful!	Nähili owadan!
Not possible, but it is possible.	Mümkin däl, ýöne bu mümkin.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
There is not much opportunity for him to leave.	Onuň gitmegi üçin kän bir mümkinçilik ýok.
Now was not the time for many words.	Indi köp söz üçin wagt däldi.
I think that will happen one day.	Bir gün şeýle bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
I know this is for me.	Munuň meniň üçin bardygyny bilýärin.
This cannot be said here.	Muny bu ýerde aýdyp bolmaz.
Where is this 	Bu nirede?
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Then he returned immediately.	Soň bolsa derrew gaýdyp geldi.
This is really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet.
That's it.	Şol.
A few things.	Birnäçe zat.
This is true or not.	Bu dogry ýa-da ýok.
The sound is great.	Ses gaty gowy.
He knows everything.	Ol hemme zady bilýär.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
This is not for us.	Bu biziň üçin däl.
This can happen at all.	Bu düýbünden bolup biler.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
I'm ready to go now.	Men häzir gitmäge taýyn.
I have no choice.	Mende mümkinçilik ýok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe şeýle.
Here is the answer.	Ine jogap.
This year was the worst.	Bu ýyl iň erbet ýyl boldy.
It doesn't have to be difficult.	Kyn bolmak hökman däl.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Until that night.	Şol gije çenli.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle.

I may be the last.	Iň soňky bolup bilerin.
Because they are different.	Sebäbi olar başga.
He knows what happened to me.	Ol maňa näme bolandygyny bilýär.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
I seem to have	Mende bar ýaly.
So it could be someone else.	Şonuň üçin başga biri bolup biler.
It's been a long time coming.	Uzak wagt gelýär.
It was there again.	Ol ýerde ýene boldy.
It would be better.	Bu has gowy bolardy.
It's just fun.	Ol diňe hezil edýär.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
It will still take time.	Oňa entek wagt gerek bolar.
Never, never, never.	Hiç haçan, hiç haçan, hiç haçan.
I would suggest it.	Men oňa teklip etjek.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
Not just in words.	Diňe söz bilen däl.
Not even life.	Durmuş hem däl.
Not just him.	Diňe onuň däl.
He came here yesterday	Düýn bu ýere geldi
Just do the right thing.	Diňe dogry zady et.
He knew it and he knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi we bilýändigini bilýärdi.
I visited once.	Bir gezek baryp gördüm.
No one could see me there.	Ol ýerde meni hiç kim görüp bilmedi.
I don't want you here	Men seni bu ýerde islämok
It may sound like bad news.	Erbet habar ýaly bolup biler.
I am always	Men elmydama.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu mesele, ýöne gowy mesele.
Good.	Gowy.
This is a difficult task for me.	Bu meniň üçin has kyn mesele.
We can think of another.	Bu hakda başga bir pikir edip bileris.
I don't know how to do it, you can help.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilemok, kömek edip bilersiňiz.
This will be the case.	Bu şeýle bolar.
He did it alone.	Ol ýeke özi etdi.
That's the way it is now.	Häzir şeýle.
It's very easy to do that.	Muny etmek gaty aňsat.
No one is coming.	Hiç kim gelenok.
He wants to get it.	Ol muny almak isleýär.
It will never happen.	Bu asla bolmaz.
Now that day.	Indi şol gün.
He did something.	Birneme etdi.
I think he was right about that.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol bu barada dogry aýtdy.
Not just a book.	Diňe bir kitap däl.
Had to go a little.	Biraz gitmeli boldy.
I'm not really.	Men aslynda beýle däl.
This is really strange.	Bu hakykatdanam geň.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
It will be.	Bolar.
It looks good on me.	Bu maňa gowy görünýär.
I have to worry about you.	Men sen hakda gaty alada etmeli.
In fact, nothing.	Aslynda hiç zat ýok.
He just knew he didn't want to be alone.	Diňe ýeke bolmak islemeýändigini bilýärdi.
I couldn't give him money.	Men oňa pul berip bilmedim.
I don't need that.	Maňa bu gerek däl.
In fact several times.	Aslynda birnäçe gezek.
Yesterday.	Düýn.
I can tell you a lot right now.	Men saňa şu wagt köp zady aýdyp bilerin.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
No one can.	Hiç kim edip bilmez.
The closest thing to you.	Size iň ýakyn zat.
I can't be with him	Men onuň bilen bolup bilemok
which one	haýsy.
This makes him crazy.	Bu ony däli edýär.
It looks great every time.	Her gezek gaty gowy görünýär.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
Such things.	Şeýle zatlar.
He can tell you.	Ol size aýdyp biler.
The last few years have been very difficult.	Soňky birnäçe ýyl gaty kyn boldy.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly zat.
If so, that's a good idea.	Şeýle bolsa, gowy pikir.
Because he could.	Sebäbi edip bilýärdi.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
It was not a sound.	Bu ses däldi.
That it is not.	Munuň ýokdugyny.
Whatever happens, it will happen.	Näme bolar, bolar.
He will come here.	Ol şu ýere geler.
Of course not as beautiful as you.	Elbetde, seniň ýaly ajaýyp däl.
I think this guy.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýigit.
You can't go anywhere else.	Başga ýere gidip bolmaz.
This is not really easy.	Bu hakykatdanam aňsat däl.
It's a little hard.	Biraz gaty kyn.
The problem is not so.	Mesele, beýle däl.
Both are gone.	Ikisi-de gitdi.
What is this	Bu näme?
This is not much.	Bu kän däl.
Just fine.	Diňe gowy.
This is not a good thing.	Bu gowy iş däl.
I had so much fun with that.	Munuň bilen gaty hezil etdim.
There is no one for them.	Olar üçin hiç kim ýok.
Please, man.	Haýyş edýärin, adam.
Here it is.	Ine, ses.
I really do.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle edýärin.
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şeýle boldy.
I could not see	Görüp bilmedim
He had never done that before.	Ol ozal beýle zat etmedi.
There will never be an easy answer to that.	Oňa hiç haçan aňsat jogap bolmaz.
That was the question.	Bu sorag boldy.
A week later something else happened.	Bir hepde soň başga bir zat boldy.
Of course, he didn't say that.	Elbetde, ol beýle zat aýtmady.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol beýle däldi.
Good?	Gowy?
You don't need to	Size gerek däl
This is really something.	Bu hakykatdanam bir zat.
Close to school	Mekdebe ýakyn.
This is true of many things.	Bu köp zat dogry.
Who is new?	Täze kim?
The last issue.	Iň soňky mesele.
Will definitely be back.	Elbetde gaýdyp geler.
They are also fast.	Olar hem çalt.
Every day after work.	Her gün işden soň.
She is smart.	Ol akylly.
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele.
You have to go	Sen gitmeli
For a bad person.	Erbet adam üçin.
Still here.	Henizem şu ýerde.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
I think that's enough.	Bu ýeterlik diýip pikir edýärin.
It will be fast.	Bu çalt bolar.
I knew it was going to be good.	Munuň gowy boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
You are not fired	Sen işden däl
They look great.	Olar gaty gowy görünýär.
He had something.	Onuň bir zady bardy.
He wanted to know more about her.	Ol hakda has köp bilmek isledi.
He realized that this could happen.	Munuň bolup biljekdigine düşündi.
I didn't see you there.	Men seni ol ýerde görmedim.
I got something	Men bir zat aldym
Everyone just had fun.	Her kim diňe hezil etdi.
He understood.	Ol düşündi.
'	' diýdi.
So it's not a problem here.	Şonuň üçin bu ýerde mesele däl.
He fully answered that.	Ol muňa doly jogap berdi.
This is nothing.	Bu hiç zat däl.
I think he did the right thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol dogry zady etdi.
In fact, we both have.	Hakykatdanam, ikimizem bar we.
I had to go.	Men gitmeli boldum.
Because it will be interesting.	Sebäbi gyzykly bolar.
So nothing else.	Şonuň üçin başga zat ýok.
OK, good, good.	Bolýar, gowy, gowy.
You have to call	Jaň etmeli
I didn't think you could do that.	Muny edip bilersiňiz diýip pikir etmedim.
It just seemed so good.	Diňe hakykatdanam gaty gowy ýalydy.
For an adult	Uly adam üçin
Life for life.	Durmuş üçin durmuş.
That sounds good.	Bu gowy ýaly.
I really want to talk to you.	Men hakykatdanam siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
That word	Şol söz.
He knows nothing about the future.	Geljek hakda hiç zat bilmeýär.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
Life is too short.	Durmuş gaty gysga.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
I never think about it.	Men ol hakda hiç wagt pikir etmeýärin.
He knew in that look that he had failed, but he could not help himself.	Munuň dogry däldigini bilýärdi, ýöne özüne kömek edip bilmedi.
In fact, this is not the case.	Aslynda bu düýbünden dogry däldi.
We can do that together.	Muny bilelikde edip bileris.
I hoped not.	Men däl diýip umyt etdim.
He was everywhere.	Ol hemme ýerde bardy.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
That's what happened to me.	Meniň üçin bu boldy.
If you need a good reason, here it is.	Gowy sebäp gerek bolsa, ine şu.
It's gone now.	Indi gitdi.
I want to be something.	Men bir zat bolmak isleýärin.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
Everyone often does.	Her kim köplenç edýär.
Okay, not a hundred.	Bolýar, ýüz däl.
Maybe it's not that bad.	Belki, ol beýle erbet däl.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
In fact, this is the best year for me.	Aslynda bu meniň üçin iň gowy ýyl.
There are a number of issues.	Birnäçe mesele bar.
This is very difficult.	Munuň özi gaty kyn.
Of course, there is no answer.	Elbetde, jogap ýok.
He asked for help.	Ol kömek sorady.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Diňe şeýle boldy.
We need more ideas.	Bize has köp pikir gerek.
Now you have to do something about it.	Indi ol hakda bir zat etmeli.
He is coming back.	Ol gaýdyp gelýär.
You don't have to be present.	Häzir bolmak hökman däl.
Not just now.	Diňe häzir däl.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
Couldn't go twice.	Iki gezek gidip bilmedi.
Elsewhere.	Başga bir ýerde.
I thought.	Men pikir etdim.
I know life is hard for you.	Bilýärin, durmuş seniň üçin gaty kyn.
This is what you need.	Bu size gerek.
It would be easier.	Bu has aňsat bolardy.
It was a great day.	Bu ajaýyp gün boldy.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy boldy.
He can see it.	Ony görüp bilýär.
Now he is here.	Indi ol şu ýerde.
Me or them.	Men ýa-da olar.
I don’t have to worry much there.	Men ol ýerde kän alada etmeli däl.
That's great.	Ine, gaty gowy.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
This is the hardest question.	Bu iň kyn sorag.
We had nothing to give.	Bize bermeli zat ýokdy.
I should be better.	Men has gowy bolmaly.
We can do it together !.	Bilelikde edip bileris!.
I was not there.	Men ol ýerde däldim.
The food here is great.	Bu ýerde nahar gaty gowy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gaty dogry söz.
I know it happened.	Men onuň bolandygyny bilýärin.
It won't be beautiful.	Bu owadan bolmaz.
It was not the time to find out.	Muny bilmek üçin wagt däldi.
I'm not like you	Men seniň ýaly däl
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
Just being there was enough.	Diňe şol ýerde bolmak ýeterlik ýalydy.
Seriously, another one.	Çynlakaý, ýene bir.
I am very close	Men gaty ýakyn
Very close.	Gaty we ýakyn.
He can't see me.	Ol meni görüp bilmeýär.
I didn't know that.	Men muny bilmedim.
They need us now.	Olar indi bize mätäç.
There are only two people.	Diňe iki adam bar.
You can make it interesting.	Muny gyzykly edip bilersiňiz.
Just like you	Edil seniň ýaly
This time you have to do it right.	Bu gezek ony dogry etmeli.
He called again.	Ol ýene jaň etdi.
It's so easy now.	Indi gaty aňsat.
Maybe it would be better with that.	Belki, munuň bilen gowy bolardy.
So you are against me, or against me.	Şonuň üçin sen meniň bilen, ýa-da maňa garşy.
Close to him.	Oňa garşy ýakyn.
How did he know that?	Muny nädip bilýärdi.
There is no answer to that.	Muňa jogap ýok.
OK, OK.	Bolýar, bolýar.
There was a word for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin bir söz bardy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Maybe this time around it won’t be long.	Belki, bu gezek hem uzak bolmaz.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, dogry däl.
This is the biggest news.	Bu iň uly habar.
This is the last.	Bu iň soňky.
It was not enough.	Ol ýeterlik däldi.
And now enough.	Indi bolsa ýeterlik.
Not yet, not at all.	Entek däl, düýbünden däl.
To go	Gitmek
They are beautiful.	Olar owadan.
What is this	Bu näme?
You can see that too.	Muny hem görüp bilersiňiz.
It doesn't seem to be that difficult.	Bu beýle kyn däl ýaly.
Like you	Seniň ýaly
Who is this man	Bu adam kim?
It was very difficult for them.	Olar üçin gaty kyn boldy.
You will never have to do that.	Muny hiç haçan etmeli bolmaz.
We are.	Biz şeýle.
Bad news.	Erbet habar.
You can see it for yourself here.	Bu ýerde özüňiz görüp bilersiňiz.
That sounds good too.	Bu hem gowy ses.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
It will be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolar.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
This is not a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele däl.
Nothing really helped.	Hiç zat hakykatdanam kömek etmedi.
That was good too.	Bu hem gowy boldy.
Something went wrong.	Bir zat erbet boldy.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
I bought it right away.	Men ony derrew satyn aldym.
Now with you	Indi seniň bilen
He will not worry.	Oňa alada bolmaz.
She is young and beautiful.	Ol ýaş we owadan.
Of course this will help.	Elbetde bu kömek eder.
That will be the case.	Şeýle bolar.
Now with you	Indi seniň bilen
It was fun.	Bu gyzykly boldy.
There is a problem.	Bir mesele bar.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
Someone took it.	Kimdir biri alyp gitdi.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
Two hours every morning.	Her gün irden iki sagat.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Then he started singing with her.	Soň bolsa onuň bilen aýdym aýdyp başlady.
Good day for that.	Munuň üçin gowy gün.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
Everywhere else.	Başga hemme ýerde.
Of course, this is for me.	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin.
If everything is fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolsa.
They are here.	Olar şu ýerde.
He did not know why.	Näme üçin bilmedi.
What! 	Näme!
It's hard for us to talk.	Biz gürleşmek kyn.
he asked.	diýip sorady.
What to do?	Näme etmeli?
This guy can do it.	Bu ýigit edip biler.
For work.	Iş üçin.
This is a difficult but necessary task.	Bu kyn, ýöne zerur mesele.
It took longer.	Bu has köp wagt aldy.
I've seen it once or twice.	Men muny bir ýa-da iki gezek gördüm.
The sound is different.	Ses başga.
For the first time, he was right.	Ol ilkinji gezek dogry aýtdy.
There were two other girls there.	Ol ýerde başga iki gyz bardy.
He never does.	Ol hiç haçan etmeýär.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
He did something very good for us.	Ol biziň üçin gaty gowy zat etdi.
She really wants to be with him.	Ol hakykatdanam onuň bilen bile bolmak isleýär.
It was as if he had never been there before.	Ozal ol ýerde ýok ýalydy.
What is this	Bu näme?
Of course, such a thing can be done.	Elbetde, beýle zady edip bolar.
That was it.	Bu hem boldy.
I do better every day.	Her gün has gowy edýärin.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
A few months.	Birnäçe aý.
He doesn't think so.	Ol beýle pikir etmeýär.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
He couldn't get it fast.	Ony çalt alyp bilmedi.
Of course, we can't do that.	Elbetde, beýle zat edip bilmeris.
If you have to do something, you have to do it well.	Bir iş etmeli bolsa, gowy etmeli.
That fool would be right.	Bu samsyk dogry bolar.
What a good idea.	Nähili gowy pikir.
Like the last two years.	Soňky iki ýyl ýaly.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
It's very difficult.	Ol gaty kyn.
And then it gets serious.	Soň bolsa çynlakaý bolýar.
This is not a big deal.	Munuň özi beýle bir uly zat däl.
I saw it.	Men ony gördüm.
It doesn't even seem like a bad thing.	Bu hatda gaty erbet ýaly däl.
This is a call.	Bu jaň.
He asked me a few questions.	Ol menden birnäçe zat sorady.
They still had something to do.	Entek etmeli zatlary bardy.
It would be interesting.	Gyzykly bolardy.
I am happy.	Men bagtly.
In fact, it is not clear.	Aslynda bu aýdyň däl.
I never saw you	Men seni hiç haçan görmedim
I knew it was never enough.	Munuň hiç haçan ýeterlik däldigini bilýärdim.
I knew what it was going to be like.	Munuň näme boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
I allowed it.	Men rugsat berdim.
There were three people against me.	Maňa garşy üç adam bardy.
Not a loan.	Karz däl.
He couldn't even speak.	Ol hatda gürläp hem bilmedi.
I think he is right.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol dogry.
Not good with that.	Munuň bilen gowy däl.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
If anyone knew, they knew it.	Kimdir biri bilýän bolsa, muny bilýärdi.
I called him last month.	Geçen aý men oňa jaň etdim.
Good things here.	Bu ýerde gowy zatlar.
Of course there is no answer.	Elbetde jogap ýok.
Not the clearest decision.	Iň aýdyň karar däl.
Good question why?	Näme üçin gowy sorag?
There was no way out.	Diňe ýol ýokdy.
I've seen you many times.	Men seni köp gezek gördüm.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
You can go to it a lot.	Siz oňa köp baryp bilersiňiz.
It's hard to say right now.	Häzir aýtmak kyn.
I'm still thinking about you.	Men henizem sen hakda pikir edýärin.
I don't know how.	Nädip bilemok.
What	Näme
There is another question with each answer.	Her jogap bilen başga bir sorag bar.
This is interesting.	Munuň özi gyzykly.
I think that's a good thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy zat.
It should be.	Bolmaly.
I am human.	Men adam.
No words.	Söz ýok.
What happened 	Näme boldy?
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Someone goes somewhere and does something.	Kimdir biri bir ýere gidip, bir zatlar edýär.
This is not good news.	Bu gowy habar däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Häzirki wagtda hemmeler şeýle edýär.
This is a big mistake.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk.
He will return.	Ol gaýdyp geler.
I wanted to do something.	Men bir zatlar etjek boldum.
I don't want anything	Men hiç zat islämok
Not necessarily.	Hökman däl.
This is not possible for me.	Meniň üçin bu mümkin däl.
I even agreed to that.	Men hatda muňa razy boldum.
Adam did it.	Adam muny etdi.
He will definitely do this.	Bu mesele hakda hökman eder.
Not just an idea.	Diňe bir pikir däl.
He is very good to me.	Ol maňa gaty gowy.
I am never alone.	Men hiç haçan ýeke däl.
It could be good.	Gowy bolup biler.
He left and he stayed.	Ol gitdi we ol galdy.
No one else knows.	Başga hiç kim bilmez.
There are two things to do today.	Şu gün etmeli iki işi bar.
About it.	Bu hakda.
After work.	Işden soň.
I think it's very difficult.	Bu hakda gaty kyn pikir edýärin.
It is always there for me.	Ol hemişe meniň üçin bolýar.
Time, it seems, is never enough.	Wagt, hiç haçan ýeterlik däl ýaly.
There is no question about such things here.	Bu ýerde beýle zatlar hakda sorag ýok.
They are not.	Olar hem däl.
He didn't think much of it.	Ol muny kän pikir etmedi.
Because it happened.	Sebäbi ol şeýle boldy.
What time is it?	Wagt näçe bolmaly?
Now with that.	Indi munuň bilen.
He asked me.	Ol menden sorady.
Of course, this is also strange.	Elbetde, bu hem geň.
I'm not there yet.	Men entek ýok.
You have to stop this.	Muny bes etmeli.
This message	Bu habar
It looks really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp görünýär.
Another week later.	Bir hepde soň ýene biri.
I have to go	Men gitmeli
Time.	Wagt.
He thought it would not be long.	Uzak bolmaz, diýip pikir etdi.
Surprisingly, he was not there.	Geň galdy, ol ýerde ýokdy.
I'm really good	Men hakykatdanam gowy
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolmaz.
That alone will not be the case.	Diňe beýle bolmaz.
Of course, he doesn't need much.	Elbetde, oňa kän bir zat gerek däl.
And then he did it again.	Soň bolsa ýene etdi.
There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
I hope it makes it big.	Uly eder diýip umyt edýärin.
What is it now.	Häzirki wagtda näme.
He was not good.	Ol gowy däldi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, öňküsi ýaly bolýar.
Not interesting anymore.	Indi gyzykly däl.
This, of course, was not interesting.	Bu, elbetde, gyzykly däldi.
So I have to tell you what to do.	Şonuň üçin maňa näme etmelidigimi aýtmaly.
It was no longer possible to go home.	Indi öýe gitmek mümkin däldi.
Good.	Gowy.
He made it as fast as ever.	Ol muny edil öňküsi ýaly çalt etdi.
Good advice.	Gowy maslahat.
There is no good answer to that.	Muňa hiç hili gowy jogap ýok.
I was alone that evening.	Şol gün agşam ýeke boldum.
There is nothing to do.	Etmeli iş ýok.
No one can tell me what happened.	Hiç kim maňa näme bolandygyny aýdyp bilmez.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Right now	Ine, şu wagt.
What a beautiful thing for a beautiful reason.	Owadan sebäp üçin nähili owadan zat.
Nothing will happen.	Hiç zat bolmaz.
Definitely good.	Elbetde gowy.
You have to be yourself.	Siziň özüňiz bolmaly.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
I couldn't do that anymore.	Men indi muny edip bilmedim.
Of course not.	Elbetde ýok.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
Police arrested him.	Polisiýa ony tussag etdi.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
It should be.	Bolmaly.
Maybe enough.	Belki ýeterlik bolar.
Then came.	Soň geldi.
He said it would be good.	Ol munuň gowy boljakdygyny aýtdy.
He will have to help us.	Ol bize kömek etmeli bolar.
For yourself.	Özüňiz üçin.
Okay, maybe next month.	Bolýar, belki indiki aý.
Everyone knows about them.	Hemmeler olar hakda bilýär.
Not the police, not the police.	Polisiýa däl, polisiýa däl.
Would you like to go with me?	Meniň bilen gitmek isleýärsiňizmi?
She was worried.	Ol alada galdy.
I'm just human.	Men diňe adam.
He and he are together.	Ol we özi bilelikde.
Very difficult, but very young.	Gaty kyn, ýöne gaty ýaş.
It's not easy for me to do that.	Muny etmek meniň üçin aňsat däl.
He is a very good man.	Ol gaty bir adam.
He was already like them.	Ol eýýäm olar ýalydy.
There was no question about it.	Bu hakda hiç hili sorag ýokdy.
Good to see you again	Seni ýene görmek gowy zat.
I don't know what he did to her.	Oňa näme edenini bilemok.
It’s a good thing to be busy here.	Bu ýerde meşgul bolmak gowy zat.
Not so.	Şeýle däl.
I want to know that.	Muny bilmek isleýärin.
He didn't even want it.	Ol hatda muny islemedi.
He did not call.	Ol jaň etmedi.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
At night.	Gijä.
More	Has köp.
We need to rest.	Biz dynç almaly.
She likes it.	Ol ony halaýar.
I want to talk to him today.	Men şu gün onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
He was not himself.	Ol özi däldi.
I don't know what happened now.	Indi näme bolandygyny bilemok.
I do.	Men şeýle edýärin.
It will be there.	Ol ýerde bolar.
He was no more.	Ol indi beýle däldi.
I don't want to be alone.	Men ýeke bolmak islämok.
We can be really smart.	Biz hakykatdanam akylly bolup bileris.
He could not think so.	Ol beýle pikir edip bilmedi.
He asked.	Sorag berdi.
And smart.	Akylly hem.
I was worried.	Meni biynjalyk etdi.
Of course you can.	Elbetde edip bilersiňiz.
No no no.	Ýok ýok ýok.
It will never happen today.	Bu gün hiç haçan bolmaz.
What am i	Men näme?
He said he could.	Edip biljekdigini aýtdy.
This is a question to answer.	Bu size jogap bermek üçin bir sorag.
"I'm not happy," he said.	Ol: "Men bagtly däl.
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
I can't do anything about it.	Men ol hakda hiç zat edip bilemok.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
She was so beautiful	Ol gaty owadan boldy
I don’t know who else could be.	Başga kim bolup biljekdigini bilemok.
A lot of things here.	Bu ýerde köp zatlar.
The right way.	Dogry ýol.
Not just work.	Diňe bir iş däl.
Now he knew.	Indi bilýärdi.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Bu hakda edip biljek zady ýokdy.
She was not a beautiful person.	Ol owadan adam däldi.
I knew it wasn't going to be easy.	Munuň aňsat bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärdim.
This seems to have happened many years ago.	Bu köp ýyl mundan ozal bolup geçen ýaly.
You have to tell us.	Bize aýtmaly.
This year is different.	Bu ýyl başga.
Now there is an interesting idea.	Indi gyzykly bir pikir bar.
They look beautiful.	Olar owadan görünýär.
Not for work, but for leisure.	Iş üçin däl, dynç almak üçin.
This is new to me.	Bu meniň üçin täze.
This is often true.	Bu köplenç dogry.
He came out to help.	Kömek üçin çykdy.
I can try.	Synap bilerin.
She was no longer just a beautiful girl.	Ol indi diňe bir owadan gyz däldi.
Just one thing.	Diňe bir zat.
It's good to be human.	Adam bolmak gowy zat.
He can help.	Ol kömek edip biler.
What a stupid thing to do.	Näme samsyk zat etmeli.
I had a problem.	Men mesele boldum.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
To rest	Dynç almak.
Why?	Näme üçin?
This is a decision.	Bu karar.
This is the first time.	Bu ýerde ilkinji gezek.
Which one is the most.	Iň köp haýsy.
I do this a lot.	Men muny köp edýärin.
There was no other way.	Indi başga ýol ýokdy.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I can call him.	Men oňa jaň edip bilerin.
Everything is there	Hemme zat bar
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, edil şonuň ýaly.
I'm not there yet.	Men henizem ýok.
He was absolutely right.	Ol düýbünden dogry aýtdy.
This is too much time for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty köp wagt.
He needs those things.	Oňa şol zatlar gerek.
We can't agree.	Biz razy bolup bilmeris.
If one day.	Bir gün bolsa.
I'm sure it will.	Boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
They just look happy.	Olar diňe bagtly ýaly görünýär.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
I need it	Maňa gerek
I called him and he didn't answer.	Men oňa jaň etdim, ol jogap bermedi.
It was not much.	Ol kän zat däldi.
It should be the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly bolmaly.
Not necessarily.	Hökman däl.
The girl is back.	Gyz gaýdyp geldi.
No working hours.	Iş wagty ýok.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
Because you can tell.	Sebäbi aýdyp bilersiňiz.
There was nothing against it.	Oňa garşy hiç zat ýokdy.
I'm ready	Men taýyn boldum.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I think that's a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
It was like this tonight.	Bu agşam şeýle boldy.
He would have to do that.	Ol muny etmeli bolardy.
To be with me	Meniň bilen bolmak
I don't know exactly what happened.	Näme bolandygyny doly bilemok.
He left with her an hour ago.	Bir sagat öň özi bilen gitdi.
I do not fully believe this.	Men muňa doly ynanamok.
He did something.	Bir zat etdi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, beýle däl.
I think it's over now.	Meniň pikirimçe, häzir boldy.
Question for the first time.	Ilkinji gezek sorag.
This is how life is today.	Ine, häzirki durmuş nähili.
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
What is the reason for this?	Munuň sebäbi näme.
He decided.	Ol karar berdi.
It's really cool.	Aslynda ajaýyp.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
He seems to know a lot about her.	Ol hakda köp zat bilýän ýaly.
Not much.	Kän däl.
Just bad.	Diňe erbet.
I tried it myself.	Özüm synap gördüm.
Until then.	Oňa çenli.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I don't do that	Men muny etmeýärin
I heard worse.	Has erbet eşitdim.
Just wonderful.	Diňe ajaýyp.
These are good things.	Bu gowy zatlar.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
This is everywhere.	Bu hemme ýerde.
It was never necessary.	Bu hiç wagt zerur däldi.
It's hard for me to answer that.	Muňa jogap bermek maňa kyn.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
Okay, maybe one.	Bolýar, belki biri.
Really	Hakykatdanam.
That was not the only idea.	Bu ýekeje pikir däldi.
It's beautiful.	Bu owadan.
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
This is a really bad idea.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet pikir.
It can be very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly bolup biler.
Not so today.	Bu gün beýle däl.
I voted for him.	Men oňa ses berdim.
For more money.	Has köp pul üçin.
More than likely.	Mümkin has köp.
So easy.	Şeýle aňsat.
The problem is money.	Mesele pul.
He advised her to think about it.	Oňa bu barada pikir edendigini maslahat berdi.
He thought he was not against it.	Muňa garşy däl diýip pikir etdi.
This is more.	Bu has köp zat.
A lot of things are not right.	Köp zat dogry däl.
That could be the case.	Bu şeýle bolup biler.
I'm calling	Men jaň edýärin
A lot of money.	Köp pul.
The problem.	Mesele.
There was no sun.	Gün ýokdy.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
Welcome.	Gowy gelýär.
Man, this is going to be a big deal.	Adam, bu gaty uly mesele bolar.
Summer is such a long time.	Tomus şeýle bir köp wagt.
Another question why should be right.	Näme üçin dogry bolmaly başga mesele.
Enough for now.	Häzirki üçin ýeterlik.
That, too, was completely wrong.	Bu hem doly dogry däldi.
He is new here.	Ol bu ýerde täze.
This is not smart.	Bu akylly däl.
He has two jobs.	Onuň iki işi bar.
It's hard.	Bu zat kyn.
I really want it.	Men ony gaty isleýärin.
I did nothing.	Men hiç zat etmedim.
This	Şu.
He can give it immediately.	Ol derrew berip biler.
Who else will be interesting.	Indiki kim gyzykly bolar.
Then he went home.	Soň öýüne gitdi.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
I think about a lot of things.	Köp zatlar hakda pikir edýärin.
What is this 	Bu näme?
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Such an opportunity does not exist at present.	Şeýle mümkinçilik häzirki wagtda ýok.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I just didn’t think much of it.	Diňe bu hakda gaty pikir etmedim.
Couldn't decide.	Karar berip bilmedi.
Of course, this will not be the last time.	Elbetde, bu soňky gezek bolmaz.
It was a great day.	Bu ajaýyp gün boldy.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolardy.
I think he tried to help me in a strange way.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol maňa geň ýol bilen kömek etjek boldy.
That man is smart.	Ol adam akylly.
Why do so many people come here?	Näme üçin bu ýere köp adam gelýär?
He didn't even want to think.	Ol hatda pikir etmek islemedi.
Not only that.	Diňe ol däl.
It looks good, of course.	Elbetde gowy görünýär.
I don't think that's right.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry däl.
He is close here.	Ol şu ýerde ýakyn.
Now he is here.	Indi ol şu ýerde.
I'm fine.	Men özüm gowy.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Munuň hakykatdanam bolmagy zerur.
That's it.	Edil şu.
Life is full.	Durmuş doly.
Very good now.	Häzir gaty gowy.
I just can't go	Diňe gidip bilemok
I had to get this job.	Men bu işi almaly boldum.
Where did everyone go?	Hemmeler nirä gitdi?
I have always been beautiful.	Men elmydama owadan boldum.
I need help.	Kömek gerek.
This is certainly not the case.	Bu, elbetde, dogry däl.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
This can be a problem.	Bu hökman bir mesele bolup biler.
We don't need help.	Bize kömek gerek däl.
Just an hour.	Diňe bir sagat.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I'm not questioning that.	Men muny sorag etmeýärin.
Closer to him.	Oňa has ýakyn.
Of course there is a reason for this.	Elbetde munuň bir sebäbi bar.
Where are we	Biz nirede
Work has begun.	Iş başlady.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
Like a man.	Adam ýaly.
Maybe not about that.	Belki bu hakda ýok.
Not in the language of hard books.	Gaty kitap dilinde däl.
I admire everyone.	Men hemmeler ýaly haýran.
He did not call anyone.	Ol hiç kime jaň etmedi.
He didn't have to.	Ol hökman däldi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I don’t know how, but it went with the money.	Nädip bilemok, ýöne pul bilen gitdi.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
We can't agree.	Biz razy bolup bilmeris.
Just like you now	Edil häzir seniň ýaly.
I just thought it would be nice to see you.	Diňe seni görmek gowy bolar öýdüpdim.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
Not so.	Beýle zat däl.
There is no short answer to that.	Muňa gaty gysga jogap ýok.
This can help.	Bu kömek edip biler.
Now there it is.	Indi ol ýere bar.
She is as beautiful as she is.	Ol edil özi ýaly owadan.
I'll have to do it myself.	Muny özüm etmeli bolaryn.
This is a difficult question.	Bu kyn sorag.
To be so.	Şeýle bolmak.
I'm there.	Men şol ýerde.
He arrived just this morning.	Ol edil şu gün irden geldi.
He was alone there.	Ol ýerde ýeke boldy.
In fact, it is not.	Aslynda beýle bolmaz.
I can't see that this could be bad for you.	Munuň siziň üçin erbet bolup biljekdigini görüp bilemok.
He said again.	Ol ýene aýtdy.
You have to do the same.	Şeýle hem etmeli.
I think about it a lot.	Men bu hakda gaty köp pikir edýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň sebäbi şeýle.
No more.	Indi ýok.
Not much, he understood quickly.	Kän däl, çalt düşündi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Munuň bir sebäbi bar bolsa gerek.
What else to do here?	Bu ýerde başga näme etmeli?
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
He could not get it.	Ol alyp bilmedi.
Just being so close to her made her so hard.	Diňe oňa şeýle ýakyn bolmak ony gaty etdi.
It must be night.	Gije bolmaly.
He didn't have to do that.	Ol muny etmeli däldi.
It was very full.	Gaty doly ýalydy.
I was not there.	Men ol ýerde däldim.
I still don't know what to do.	Näme etmelidigimi henizem bilemok.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
Of course he couldn't.	Elbetde edip bilmedi.
He came back for her.	Ol onuň üçin gaýdyp geldi.
It couldn't go anywhere.	Bu hiç ýere gidip bilmedi.
I could never do that.	Men muny hiç haçan edip bilmedim.
OK, you don't need to.	Bolýar, size gerek däl.
This seems to me to be a mistake.	Bu maňa ýalňyşlyk ýaly bolup görünýär.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Twice every time.	Hemme gezek iki gezek.
He really couldn't do that.	Ol hakykatdanam muny edip bilmedi.
This is for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin.
It's very difficult to decide.	Karar bermek gaty kyn.
All you need is	Diňe zerur zat.
You have to tell him that.	Oňa muny aýtmaly.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, edil şonuň ýaly.
Everything seemed easy.	Hemme zat aňsat ýalydy.
You have to take it, you have to take it, you have to take it!	Ony almaly, almaly, almaly!
It looks right to you.	Saňa dogry görünýär.
He thought so too.	Ol hem şeýle pikir etdi.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
He's gone now.	Ol indi gitdi.
This was a big mistake.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk boldy.
There was one person, only one person.	Ol ýerde bir adam, diňe bir adam bardy.
The former.	Öňküsi.
One, two, many.	Bir, iki, köp.
Of course, there was someone.	Elbetde, kimdir biri bardy.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
It will be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolar.
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
He tried to call you last night.	Düýn agşam size jaň etjek boldy.
I thought it was good.	Gowy diýip pikir etdim.
She was worried.	Alada bilen alada galdy.
They are busy and happy.	Olar meşgul we bagtly.
There are a lot of people.	Adam köp.
I don’t know why there was a disturbance.	Näme üçin biynjalyk bolandygyny bilemok.
What does the problem look like? 	Mesele näme bolup görünýär?
This makes him human.	Bu bolsa ony adam edýär.
He thought it was such a wonderful evening.	Şeýle ajaýyp agşam diýip pikir etdi.
They were nothing to me.	Olar meniň üçin hiç zat däldi.
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
This is not surprising enough.	Bu ýeterlik geň däl.
Of course, this was not the case for me.	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin däldi.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
Then two more.	Soň ýene iki.
We can buy.	Satyn alyp bileris.
I found a way.	Men bir ýol gördüm.
It will help us.	Bize kömek bolar.
Seriously? 	Çynlakaý?
Of course	Elbetde,
He knew.	Ol bilýärdi.
Ready this time.	Bu gezek taýyn.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
Not everyone can.	Hemmeler edip bilmeýär.
So this is possible, but not interesting.	Şonuň üçin bu mümkin, ýöne gyzykly däl.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
Big things in fact.	Aslynda uly zatlar.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
He will be here too.	Ol hem şu ýerde bolar.
We can see it.	Biz ony görüp bileris.
It just wasn’t there anymore.	Diňe indi ýokdy.
I have to sing for them.	Olar üçin aýdym aýtmaly.
It was good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy boldy.
A few bad months, a few good months.	Birnäçe erbet aý, birnäçe gowy aý.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
He did nothing.	Hiç zat etmedi.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
There is a year.	Bir ýyl bar.
It's too early.	Bu entek ir.
This is a job.	Bu bir iş.
What could be wrong with him?	Oňa näme zyýan berip biler?
Now I think about myself.	Häzir özüm hakda pikir edýärin.
This path no longer exists.	Bu ýol indi ýok.
I now know what he thinks.	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini indi bilýärin.
I had to go.	Men gitmeli boldum.
There must be someone else.	Başga biri bolmaly.
This is more interesting.	Bu has gyzykly.
I think he is.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
Okay, not for you.	Bolýar, siziň üçin däl.
He has always been good to me.	Ol maňa hemişe gowy geldi.
It doesn't take long.	Uzak wagt gerek däl.
Not even a thing.	Hat-da bir zat däl.
In fact, more.	Aslynda has köp.
To be very close.	Gaty ýakyn bolmak.
Of course, there was something.	Elbetde, bir zat bardy.
I hope the help comes.	Kömek geler diýip umyt edýärin.
I did not have.	Mende ýokdy.
Maybe one or two more.	Belki, ýene bir ýa-da iki.
He started calling her.	Ol oňa jaň edip başlady.
I said that.	Men muny aýtdym.
And now it's time to dump her and move on.	Indi bolsa bu işe başlady.
Everyone does a few things.	Her kim birnäçe iş edýär.
I don't have to do that	Men muny etmeli däl
Money for something.	Bir zat üçin pul.
He doesn't like it.	Ol muny halamaýar.
It was not immediately.	Derrew däldi.
I can't see you like that	Men seni beýle görüp bilemok
I was very close.	Men gaty ýakyn boldum.
He took it from you.	Ol muny senden aldy.
Maybe there is one worse.	Belki has erbet biri bar.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
No it's not.	Ýok beýle däl.
We can't do that.	Muny edip bilmeris.
Good.	Gowy.
He knows he can do it.	Edip biljekdigini bilýär.
Not you anymore	Indi sen däl
He has to rest.	Ol dynç almaly.
I just want to be myself.	Diňe özüm bolmak isleýärin.
It wasn't smart.	Bu akylly däldi.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
This is not smart for me.	Meniň üçin bu akylly däl.
Now I can speak to them in their own language.	Indi olar bilen öz dilinde gürläp bilerin.
Even short hopes.	Hatda gysga umyt.
I had to go.	Men gitmeli boldum.
This is not very good.	Bu gaty gowy däl.
Good man	Gowy adam.
What happened	Näme boldy?
It was nothing.	Bu hiç zat däldi.
I never knew such a thing would happen.	Munuň ýaly zadyň boljakdygyny hiç wagt bilmeýärdim.
I have to be.	Men bolmaly.
He is like us.	Ol biziň ýaly.
He did not ask questions.	Ol sorag bermedi.
Really help us.	Hakykatdanam bize kömek et.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
He likes it too.	Ol hem muny halaýar.
He thought I was thinking now.	Ol häzir pikir edýärin diýip pikir etdi.
Only he was no more.	Diňe ol indi beýle däldi.
This is for me.	Bu meniň üçin.
They are so beautiful	Olar gaty owadan
Can you help?	Kömek edip bilersiňizmi?
It was good to see that.	Muny görmek gowy boldy.
I really need to take care of myself.	Men hakykatdanam özüm hakda alada etmeli.
This is not the only thing.	Bu ýöne bir zat däl.
He stayed.	Ol galdy.
Then he started working.	Soň bolsa işe başlady.
Good news.	Gowy habar.
He is not.	Ol beýle däl.
He came home.	Öýüne geldi.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
It wasn't that close.	Bu beýle ýakyn däldi.
It will be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolar.
I doubt it will be easy.	Munuň aňsat boljakdygyna şübhelenýärin.
There is no right way for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin dogry ýol ýok.
He took it from me.	Ol menden aldy.
There has been no response for a week.	Bir hepde bäri hiç hili jogap ýok.
Not enough money.	Pul ýeterlik däl.
This is not true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry däl.
Not there, but there.	Ol ýerde däl, ýöne şol ýerde.
There was never enough money.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik pul ýokdy.
He could not see anyone there.	Ol ýerde hiç kimi görüp bilmedi.
A lot of things.	Köp zat.
We can go home.	Öýe gidip bileris.
I knew it could happen.	Munuň bolup biljekdigini bilýärdim.
We are someone	Biz kimdir biri
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
I can tell you what he thinks.	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini aýdyp bilerin.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
They are so beautiful.	Olar gaty owadan.
He will come as one.	Ol biri ýaly geler.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Biraz hezil etmegiň wagty geldi.
In fact, I can't do it right now.	Aslynda şu wagt edip bilemok.
He could not sleep.	Ol uklap bilmedi.
It looks great.	Gaty gowy görünýär.
He couldn't even think about it tomorrow.	Ertir hem bu barada pikir edip bilmedi.
The thought did not bother him.	Bu pikir ony biynjalyk etmedi.
I was not there for them.	Men olar üçin ýokdy.
I did.	Men etdim.
One, not much.	Biri, kän däl.
Time is hard.	Wagt kyn.
It's getting harder.	Kyn bolýar.
No one paid much attention.	Hiç kim kän bir üns bermedi.
I have a song.	Mende bir aýdym bar.
This is us.	Bu biz.
How?	Nädip?
He never told himself what had happened.	Özüne näme bolandygyny hiç wagt aýtmady.
That's not enough yet.	Bu entek ýeterlik däl.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
This is the last.	Bu iň soňky.
This time it's easy.	Bu gezek aňsat.
Of course not.	Elbetde, bilmeýär.
It was also new.	Bu hem täze boldy.
I saw this somewhere.	Men muny şu ýerde bir ýerde gördüm.
And then it started.	Soň bolsa başlady.
Seriously, there are so many.	Çynlakaý, gaty köp zat bar.
He took her away.	Ony alyp gitdi.
This is often true.	Bu köplenç dogry.
Good suggestion.	Gowy teklip.
Quick.	Çalt.
I think something happened.	Bir zat boldy öýdýän.
It doesn't do that.	Muny etmeýär.
He really did.	Ol hakykatdanam etdi.
Many	Köp.
Just like you	Özüňiz ýaly.
I'll do it right.	Dogry etjek.
It does something for me.	Bu maňa bir zat edýär.
He immediately understood.	Ol derrew düşündi.
Only one thing for us.	Biziň üçin diňe bir zat.
What is this sound?	Bu ses näme?
He seemed to know what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýän ýalydy.
I think it would be good.	Gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
He is absolutely right.	Ol bu barada düýbünden dogry aýdýar.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
We are really here.	Biz hakykatdanam şu ýerde.
I can't agree	Men razy bolup bilemok
You will have to go somewhere else.	Başga bir ýere gitmeli bolarsyňyz.
There is no question about that.	Bu hakda hiç hili sorag ýok.
Okay, bigger.	Bolýar, has uly.
More work will be needed.	Has köp iş gerek bolar.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
This is a bit of a concern.	Bu birneme alada.
I am happy here.	Men bu ýerde bagtly.
I think that's right.	Bu dogry diýip pikir edýärin.
Really bad things.	Hakykatdanam erbet zatlar.
He had time.	Onuň wagty bardy.
More on that tomorrow.	Ertir bu barada has köp zat.
He knew we had it.	Ol biziň bardygyny bilýärdi.
Not really.	Aslynda dogry däl.
He was there too.	Ol hem bardy.

Too many questions.	Gaty köp sorag.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Biraz hezil etmegiň wagty geldi.
He could take everything now.	Ol indi hemme zady alyp bilýärdi.
Very close and very beautiful.	Gaty ýakyn we gaty owadan.
Couldn't be better.	Gowy bolup bilmedi.
In fact, there are many.	Aslynda gaty köp.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
Someone told me he just wanted to give me money.	Bir adam maňa diňe pul bermek isleýändigini aýtdy.
I will be crazy.	Men däli bolaryn.
This bothered him.	Bu oňa biynjalyk boldy.
Good sound.	Gowy ses.
He doesn't think about it.	Ol bu hakda pikir etmeýär.
It's easy to see why.	Munuň beýle bolandygyny görmek aňsat.
He would have been here before.	Ol öňem şu ýerde bolardy.
That would be really nice.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy bolardy.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
Maybe it wasn’t such a smart idea.	Belki, beýle akylly pikir däldi.
They are not there.	Olar ol ýerde däl.
In fact, he is already there.	Aslynda, ol eýýäm şol ýerde.
He said he had to say it now.	Ol muny indi aýtmaly diýdi.
Someone has to do something about it.	Kimdir biri bu barada bir zat etmeli.
It will be good because it must be good.	Ol gowy bolar, sebäbi ol gowy bolmaly.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Köp gün meniň üçin gowy bolsa gerek.
He agreed.	Ol razy boldy.
He called me today.	Ol şu gün maňa jaň etdi.
He didn't want it.	Ol ony islemedi.
We don't need it.	Bize gerek däl.
I can do well.	Men gowy edip bilerin.
Today is possible.	Bu gün mümkin.
You have to be.	Sen bolmaly.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
What?	Näme?
It doesn't have to be anything.	Oňa hiç zat bolmaly däl.
Why?	Näme üçin?
I didn't do that well.	Men beýle gowy etmedim.

He must be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolmaly.

That was not enough.	Ol muňa ýeterlik däldi.
What did he do?	Ol näme etdi.

Something would happen.	Bir zat bolardy.
He says there.	Ol şol ýerde aýdýar.
This, of course.	Bu, elbetde.
He welcomed me.	Ol meni garşy aldy.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Eýýäm bir zatlar etmegiň wagty geldi.
It can be very difficult for him, maybe too much.	Özüne gaty kyn bolup biler, belki gaty köp.
Nor will it be.	Şeýle hem bolmaz.
He never did.	Ol hiç haçan beýle däl.
There may actually be more.	Aslynda has köp bolup biler.
I have tried this several times.	Muny birnäçe gezek synap gördüm.
He did it now.	Häzir etdi.
It was nice to see him.	Ony görmek maňa gowy boldy.
He paid attention to me.	Ol maňa üns berdi.
It was bad.	Erbet gowy boldy.
Everything helps.	Her bir zat kömek edýär.
I have no idea.	Mende beýle pikir ýok.
He will be my first.	Ol meniň ilkinji bolar.
It is impossible to say for sure.	Hakykatdanam aýtmak mümkin däl.
That's a lot of money.	Bu gaty köp pul.
I will be here	Men şu ýerde bolaryn
I don't want to be someone else.	Başga biri bolmak islämok.
I'm really happy!	Men hakykatdanam bagtly!
This is not the best thing.	Bu iň gowy zat däl.
This is not a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat däl.
There was nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýokdy.
I asked another question.	Başga sorag berdim.
I was early.	Men ir boldum.
This is very good advice.	Bu gaty gowy maslahat.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
It was a little difficult.	Bu birneme kyn boldy.

It used to be.	Ozal bar.
I can go back again.	Başga bir gezek gaýdyp bilerin.
Why you	Näme üçin sen?
A few months.	Birnäçe aý.
I didn't do that.	Men muny etmedim.
I can only enjoy it.	Men diňe lezzet alyp bilerin.
The news was not good.	Habar gowy däldi.
Just what happens.	Diňe näme bolýar.
So that must be true.	Şonuň üçin bu dogry bolmaly.
He wanted to be.	Bolmak isledi.
Because they need to.	Sebäbi olar zerur.
OK, interesting.	Bolýar, gyzykly.
I didn't want to talk to anyone right now.	Häzirki wagtda hiç kim bilen gürleşmek islemedim.
This is not a lie.	Bu ýalan däl.
He did it.	Bu oňa etdi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Diňe şeýle umyt edip bolar.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
I never did that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmedim.
He could not do so.	Ol beýle edip bilmedi.

He needs you for that.	Munuň üçin ol size mätäç.
I couldn't tell you	Men size habar berip bilmedim
That's the way it is today.	Häzirki wagtda şeýle bolmaly.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýok.
He wanted to know what he was thinking.	Ol näme pikir edýändigini bilmek isledi.
I was somewhere in the evening.	Men agşam bir ýerde boldum.
It can be good or bad.	Bu gowy ýa-da erbet bolup biler.
He could see nothing.	Ol hiç zady görüp bilmedi.
Good.	Gowy.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
I think maybe he'll need help.	Meniň pikirimçe, belki, oňa kömek gerek bolar.
That's great.	Bu hem uly.
He did not want to do that.	Ol beýle etmek islemedi.
More roads.	Has köp ýol.
Life is harder.	Durmuş has kyn.
I can't answer that.	Men muňa jogap berip bilemok.
I knew he knew everything.	Men onuň hemme zady bilýändigini bilýärdim.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
No matter how good it is.	Bu näçe gowy bolsa.
He wants to see me.	Ol meni nädip görmek isleýär.

It has to be somewhere.	Bu ýerde bir ýerde bolmaly.
You know, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Bilýärsiň, muny et.
The news is bad, very bad.	Habar erbet, gaty erbet.

That's fine with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy.
I've tried it now.	Men häzir synap gördüm.
I don't want to do that.	Men muny etmek islämok.
He had to stop it now or at all.	Muny indi ýa-da asla bes etmeli boldy.
You are so beautiful	Siz gaty ajaýyp
We don't need help.	Bize kömek gerek däl.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.

You will have to do this.	Muny etmeli bolar.
I can see everything.	Men hemme zady görüp bilýärin.
They are here.	Olar şu ýerde.

There was no such person.	Beýle adam ýokdy.
He can do anything.	Ol hemme zady edip biler.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda muňa düýbünden garşy.
I'll be fine with you.	Men saňa gowy bolaryn.
He can go.	Ol gidip biler.
It gets interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolýar.

Sorry, this is not good news for you.	Bagyşlaň, bu siziň üçin has gowy habar däl.

He agrees with me.	Ol meniň bilen razy.
Who's there 	Ol ýerde kim bar?
Every time.	Her gezek.

And then he came out.	Soň bolsa çykdy.
Probably a few years.	Birnäçe ýyl gerek bolsa gerek.
What happened, happened.	Näme boldy, boldy.

Nothing else.	Başga zat ýok.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He helped me a lot.	Ol maňa köp kömek etdi.
There will be other things.	Başga zatlar bolar.

He is already here.	Ol öňem şu ýerde.
This was no longer the case.	Bu indi däldi.
You have it, it doesn't exist yet.	Sen bar, ol entek ýok.

Of course, everyone knew that.	Elbetde, muny hemmeler bilýärdi.

It looks really big.	Hakykatdanam uly ýaly görünýär.
This is a problem.	Bu bir mesele.

He did a great, wonderful job.	Uly, ajaýyp iş etdi.

Once upon a time he didn't want anything bad for himself.	Bir gezek özüne erbet zat islemedi.
She was ready to go.	Ol gitmäge taýyn boldy.
Who we are.	Biz kim.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.

For me, but not really.	Meniň üçin, ýöne hakykatdanam däl.

Everything about him really existed.	Ol hakda hemme zat hakykatdanam bardy.
He had a lot to say.	Onuň aýdyp biljek köp zady bardy.

Of course, he didn't know.	Elbetde, bilmeýärdi.
One two, one two.	Bir iki, bir iki.

The future is long.	Uzak geljek.

I have a question.	Mende bir sorag bar.
It was not a good thing.	Gowy zat däldi.
It's too short.	Ol gaty gysga.
Because you are fast.	Sebäbi sen çalt.
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
There is nothing that anyone can see.	Hiç kimiň görüp biljek zady ýok.
I think it's good this time.	Meniň pikirimçe bu gezek gowy.
This will never happen.	Bu hiç haçan bolmaz.
Nor will it be.	Şeýle hem bolmaz.
It took three years.	Munuň üçin üç ýyl aldy.
This may be strange.	Bu geň bolup biler.
This is very crazy.	Bu gaty däli.
The only reason for this is.	Munuň ýeke-täk sebäbi.
To enjoy, to give.	Lezzet almak, bermek.

It can help you.	Size kömek edip biler.
This is often the case with everyone.	Muny köplenç hemmeler bilýär.
Do it now	Indi et.

You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Size gitmek üçin diňe bir zat gerek.
Of course, this is a difficult issue.	Elbetde, bu kyn mesele.
The man said goodbye.	Adam gowy diýdi.
So this should not be the case.	Şonuň üçin bu mesele bolmaly däl.
I often do this now.	Men köplenç şu wagt edýärin.
That's a lot.	Bu birneme köp.

I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
This man offered me a job.	Bu adam maňa iş teklip etdi.

That can't be easy.	Bu aňsat bolup bilmez.
He doesn't care about such things.	Ol beýle zatlar hakda birneme alada etmeýär.

And then he came out.	Soň bolsa çykdy.
Because there is something.	Sebäbi bir zat bar.

Everything is perfect for everyone.	Hemme zat hemmeler üçin ajaýyp ýerde ajaýyp.
He hasn't thought about his job yet.	Ol entek öz işi hakda pikir edip bilmedi.
You have to do the right thing.	Zerur zatlary etmeli.
They are full.	Olar doly.
I never saw it.	Men muny hiç haçan görmedim.
The reason for this is me.	Munuň sebäbi bolsa men.

There was no hope and only one thing to do.	Umyt ýokdy we diňe bir etmeli zat bardy.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu ýerde gowy zat.

In fact, it can't be.	Aslynda beýle bolup bilmez.
I can't say enough.	Men ýeterlik diýip biljek däl.
This is a new year.	Bu täze ýyl.
It will take a few days.	Birnäçe gün gerek bolar.
He actually said that.	Aslynda muny aýtdy.
Good.	Gowy.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe dogry bolmaly.
Maybe you can help.	Belki kömek edip bilersiňiz.
No one helped him.	Hiç kim oňa kömek etmedi.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman däl.
Not a new person.	Täze adam däl.
Strange is my thing.	Geň zat ýaly meniň zadym.
I think he did something wrong.	Onuň erbet iş edendigini pikir edýärin.
Of course he will.	Elbetde eder.
He has to decide.	Ol karar bermeli.
The money came quickly.	Pul çalt geldi.
This is good news.	Bu gowy habar.
Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
Often this is a good thing.	Köplenç bu gowy zat.
No one has to tell me.	Hiç kim maňa aýtmaly bolmaz.
This time he agreed to go with me.	Bu gezek ol meniň bilen gitmäge razy boldy.
I tried this.	Muny synap gördüm.
This is not difficult either.	Bu hem kyn däl.
He could buy anything he wanted.	Islän zadyny satyn alyp bilýärdi.
He had to stop it.	Ol muny bes etmeli boldy.
Who is this?	Bu kim.
Of course, nothing else.	Elbetde, başga bir zat ýok.
I always	Men hemişe .
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
He came.	Ol geldi.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
Not everyone.	Hemmeler däl.
He says he can't do that.	Muny edip bilmeýändigini aýdýar.
No one knew about you.	Hiç kim sen hakda bilmeýärdi.
He is no more.	Ol indi hiç zat däl.
It would be almost impossible to do that.	Muny etmek mümkin däl diýen ýaly bolardy.
Here it is today.	Ine, şu gün.
I still can't believe it.	Henizem ynanamok.
There was not much there.	Ol ýerde kän zat ýokdy.
I couldn't stop thinking about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etmegi bes edip bilmedim.
There were probably two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bardy, ähtimal.
I can't think of anything.	Men näme pikir edip bilemok.
In fact, they are as bad as ever.	Aslynda, olar öňküsi ýaly erbet.
He thought it was good.	Gowy, diýip pikir etdi.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
Tell him the same thing.	Oňa edil şol bir zady aýdyň.
That was the problem.	Bu mesele boldy.
"I'm sorry," he said.	Bagyşlaň, diýdi.
So another way for me.	Şonuň üçin meniň üçin başga ýol.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
Going to work	Işe gitmek
I had to either fully admit it or leave.	Men ýa doly boýun almaly ýa-da gitmeli boldum.
Big enough for me alone.	Diňe meniň üçin ýeterlik uly.
Wonderful life with you.	Seniň bilen ajaýyp durmuş.
It seemed impossible.	Mümkin däl ýalydy.
So it will be very short.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty gysga bolar.
I'm kind of	Men bir hili.
Not just them.	Diňe olar däl.
This is for him.	Bu onuň üçin.
This is a great thing for this week.	Bu hepde üçin gaty gowy zat.
How is that	Bu nähili?
It's at home.	Bu öýde.
This morning, I think.	Ine, şu gün irden meniň pikirimçe.
You have to do better.	Has gowy etmeli.
It was really fun.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly boldy.
Just here and there.	Diňe şu ýerde we gitdi.
He is no longer young.	Ol indi ýaş däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe bir zat.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
This is a complete lie.	Bu düýbünden ýalan.
He told her.	Ol oňa aýtdy.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
You have nothing here.	Bu ýerde size hiç zat ýok.
The problem is you.	Mesele sen.
I knew he was there.	Ol ýerde bardygyny bilýärdim.
I know a lot.	Men gaty köp zady bilýärin.
Oh! 	Aý!
I didn't think about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim.
No one really knows.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam bilenok.
I can't answer that.	Men muňa jogap berip bilemok.
We can do it completely!	Muny doly edip bileris!
It was not good at all.	Bu düýbünden gowy däldi.
Everyone came with him.	Hemmeler onuň bilen geldi.
I have	Mende bar
It's very easy to do that.	Muny etmek gaty aňsat.
The question is difficult.	Sorag kyn.
I don't believe it.	Men oňa ynanamok.
There is everything for that.	Munuň üçin bar zat bar.
He knew something.	Ol bir zady bilýärdi.
I want to do something wonderful.	Ajaýyp bir zat etmek isleýärin.
I can't be like them.	Men olar ýaly bolup bilemok.
It's a lie, but it's a lie.	Bu gaty ýalan, ýöne ýalan.
This is not a good word.	Bu gowy söz däl.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Elbetde has gowy durmuş.
I can't tell anyone.	Hiç kime aýdyp bilemok.
It will be now.	Indi bolar.
I hope it doesn't happen again.	Indiki hem bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
Nothing serious.	Çynlakaý zat ýok.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
What? 	Näme?
He knew what he was doing.	Ol näme edýändigini bilýärdi.
I can say that.	Men muny aýdyp bilerin.
He could not sleep.	Ol uklap bilmedi.
He said the same.	Ol hem şeýle diýdi.
I gave him everything.	Men oňa hemme zady berdim.
I agree.	Men razy.
He just came back yesterday.	Ol diňe düýn gaýdyp geldi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, biri etdi.
He has to go himself.	Ol özi gitmeli.
I want to do something, to be someone.	Bir zat etmek isleýärin, kimdir biri bolmak.
I'm not very lucky.	Men kän bir mümkinçilik däl.
This is a difficult thing.	Bu kyn zat.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
Now he understands.	Indi düşündi.
This is a serious matter!	Bu çynlakaý iş!
In fact, this is often the case.	Aslynda bu köp wagt bolýar.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa ýol bermedi.
No one knows what will happen tomorrow.	Ertir näme boljakdygyny hiç kim bilmeýär.
It looks good on me.	Maňa gowy görünýär.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
He is a young man.	Ol ýigit.
Of course, I hope to do it again.	Elbetde, ýene bir gezek ederin diýip umyt edýärin.
I would be fine with you.	Men saňa gowy bolardy.
I took a lot of time for him.	Men onuň üçin köp wagt aldym.
There is something for that.	Munuň üçin bir zat bar.
What an idea.	Nähili pikir.
Maybe we can go somewhere else.	Belki başga ýere gidip bileris.
It's about now.	Bu häzir hakda.
She seemed so close.	Ol şeýle ýakyn ýalydy.
This is not clear.	Bu aýdyň däl.
Okay.	Bolýar.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.

This makes me a little worried.	Bu meni birneme biynjalyk edýär.
It will be.	Bolar.
That sounds great.	Bu gaty gowy ýaly.
That sounds very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly ýaly.
I want to know how to do this.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilmek isleýärin.
He will do the right thing.	Dogry zady eder.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
This, of course, is not what happened.	Bu, elbetde, bolup geçen zat däl.
He wants to see you.	Ol sizi görmek isleýär.
Better yet.	Has gowy we has gowy.
He said more.	Has köp zat diýdi.
What is the closest?	Iň ýakyn näme?
I had to tell him.	Men oňa aýtmaly boldum.
A strange but interesting book.	Geň, ýöne gyzykly kitap.
He did it now.	Indi etdi.
There was a lot there.	Ol ýerde köp zat bardy.
You can have more.	Siz has köp zat bolup bilersiňiz.
Of course not.	Elbetde, size däl.
You have to answer me.	Maňa jogap bermeli.
This made me even more anxious.	Bu meni has biynjalyk etdi.

I'm sure he will.	Etjekdigine ynanýaryn.
What a sound.	Näme ses.
I couldn't get it	Men ony alyp bilmedim
That's very difficult.	Ine gaty kyn.
He did a lot of people.	Ol köp adam etdi.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I had never seen him before.	Ony öň görmedim.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle.
Do it right this time.	Bu gezek dogry et.
Must do.	Etmeli.
It will be a wonderful day, tomorrow will be a wonderful day.	Bu ajaýyp gün bolar, ertir ajaýyp gün bolar.
No need.	Gerek däldi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I knew the truth.	Men hakykaty bilýärdim.
No one did.	Hiç kim etmedi.
It would be nice to see you again.	Seni ýene görmek gowy bolardy.
I got myself today.	Men şu gün özümi aldym.
It wasn't that close.	Bu beýle ýakyn däldi.
I didn't want that.	Men muny islemedim.
You have to do more than two things.	Iki zady has köp etmeli.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, munuň sebäbi.
Not just for me.	Diňe meniň üçin däl.
And now.	Indi bolsa.
I know he can.	Edip biljekdigini bilýärin.

What good news to see.	Görmek hakda nähili gowy habar.
There will always be and will be.	Elmydama bolar we bolar.
This is good news and bad news.	Bu gowy habar we erbet habar.
I believe it will be good.	Gowy boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
Even short.	Hatda gysga.
Maybe something happened.	Belki bir zat bolup biler.
Maybe not just the sun.	Belki diňe gün däl.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
He asked what else was there.	Başga näme bardygyny sorady.
It looks good on me.	Maňa gowy görünýär.
You can go home.	Öýe gidip bilersiňiz.
Who won't	Kim bolmaz?
No one can say that.	Muny hiç bir adam aýdyp bilmez.
He didn't want to do anything anymore.	Ol indi hiç zat etmek islemedi.
He told me it would not happen.	Ol maňa beýle bolmaz diýdi.
I know this isn't much.	Munuň kän däldigini bilýärin.
It came to us.	Bize geldi.
It was too bad to leave.	Gitmek gaty erbet boldy.
I didn't know better.	Men mundan gowy bilmedim.
Who cares.	Kimiň wagty geldi diýen pikir.
It happens every day.	Her gün bolýar.
That was not the case.	Munuň sebäbi däldi.
He knew it for the first time.	Ol ilkinji gezek bilýärdi.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
It could not have been easier.	Aňsat bolup bilmedi.
Bad idea.	Erbet pikir.
I thought about it a lot.	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim.
Maybe it's not such a good idea to think about it now.	Belki, indi bu hakda pikir etmek beýle gowy pikir däl.
Very close.	Gaty ýakyn.
Then a few more.	Soň ýene birnäçe.
You are very smart	Siz gaty akylly
He did it completely.	Ony doly etdi.
There was no time.	Wagt ýokdy.
It's just too hard.	Diňe gaty kyn.
Maybe.	Belki, mümkin.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
I did.	Men etdim.
It should be.	Bolmaly.
Nothing was the same as before.	Hiç zat öňküsi ýaly däldi.
There can be many reasons for this.	Munuň köp sebäbi bolup biler.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
Can't call anymore	Indi jaň edip bolmaz
He is a good man.	Ol gowy adam.
She really has to go to school.	Ol hakykatdanam mekdebe gitmeli.
He got it all.	Hemmesini aldy.
A few days maybe.	Birnäçe gün belki.
In fact, it was not his business.	Aslynda bu onuň işi däldi.
First time, last time.	Ilkinji gezek, soňky gezek.
About to do.	Etmek hakda.
So do we.	Biz hem şeýle.
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
I didn’t know anyone else did that anymore.	Mundan beýläk hiç kimiň muny edenini bilmeýärdim.
It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
This, of course, was new.	Bu, elbetde, täze boldy.
And then he thought.	Soň bolsa pikir etdi.
Of course, every month.	Elbetde, her aý.
I want to be someone	Men kimdir biri bolmak isleýärin
This is also possible.	Bu hem mümkin.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
There is nothing else you can do.	Başga edip biljek zady ýok.
Good thing about that.	Bu hakda gowy zat.
What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Hakykatdanam ajaýyp zat.
He just didn't want to.	Ol diňe islemedi.
No wonder there.	Ol ýerde geň däl.
She was worried.	Ol biynjalyk boldy.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
There seems to be only one book.	Diňe bir kitap bar ýaly.
I agree with him.	Men onuň bilen razy boldum.
Maybe not good.	Belki gowy däl.
I told you the truth.	Men saňa hakykaty aýtdym.
There will be three.	Üç bolar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu bir däli, ine şeýle.
He says a lot about them.	Olar hakda köp zat aýdýar.
Not just for work, but for everything.	Diňe iş üçin däl, hemme zat üçin.
You need this or that.	Size bu ýa-da başga zat gerek.
The answer is not here.	Jogap bu ýerde däl.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu dogry däl ýaly.
A long way to go.	Hakykatdanam uzak ýol.
This is bad news.	Bu erbet habar.
Same thing.	Edil şol bir zat.
This will be the case.	Bu şeýle bolar.
What an idea.	Näme pikir.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
There was time for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin wagt bardy.
He did it three times.	Ol muny üç gezek etdi.
Forgive me already.	Öňem bagyşlaň.
He knew he didn't want to do that.	Ol muny islemeýändigini bilýärdi.
He ignored it.	Ol muňa üns bermedi.
That should be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaly.
What.	Näme.
And it was fun.	We hezil boldy.
He didn't know everything and nothing.	Ol hemme zady we hiç zady bilmeýärdi.
I couldn't think of anything else.	Başga zat hakda pikir edip bilmedim.
This should help him a little.	Bu oňa birneme kömek etmeli.
Something that will destroy you.	Seni ýok etjek zat.
It's a lot of fun.	Bu gaty hezil.
He didn't even do that.	Ol hatda beýle etmedi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ol ýerde gaty bir zat ýok.
For me, these are two.	Meniň üçin bu ikisi.
This time it's just me.	Bu gezek diňe men.
Nothing was good.	Hiç zat gowy däldi.
This is a really good book.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy kitap.
Impossible	Mümkin däl
Probably not.	Mümkin däl bolsa gerek.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
I am closer.	Men has ýakyn.
Really good.	Hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
Because he is there.	Sebäbi ol şol ýerde.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
No one could.	Hiç kim edip bilmedi.
In fact it is very complete.	Aslynda gaty doly.
This is not about the girl today.	Ine, şu gün gyz hakda däl.
Don't you agree?	Razy dälmi?
I want him to do that.	Men muny etmegini isleýärin.
He must have known that.	Ol muny bilýän bolmaly.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
This is another time.	Bu başga wagt.
They can be really good.	Olar hakykatdanam gowy bolup biler.
They already existed.	Olar öňem bardy.
OK, not you.	Bolýar, sen däl.
So we are not at all.	Şonuň üçin biz asla beýle däl.
In fact, it is not.	Aslynda ýok, beýle däl.
This is a problem.	Bu kynçylyk.
We can't really go anywhere.	Biz hakykatdanam hiç ýere gidip bilmeris.
I didn't care about anyone.	Men hiç kime alada etmedim.
I think that's what he is.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu onuň özi.
He is.	Ol şeýle.
Because there was a lot of noise.	Sebäbi gaty ses bardy.
I can do that, no problem.	Men muny edip bilerin, mesele ýok.
All you have to do is tell the truth.	Bar etmeli zady, hakykaty aýtmak.
Well, he didn't tell anyone.	Gowy, ol hiç kime aýtmady.
Nothing.	Hiç zat däl.
I want something else.	Başga bir zat isleýärin.
This is the only way.	Bu ýeke-täk ýol.
I have to give him some advice.	Men oňa birneme maslahat bermeli.
That's the way it is.	Ine, şeýle bolar.
I was myself.	Men özüm boldum.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
He could not say.	Ol aýdyp bilmedi.
He sang the most beautiful song.	Iň owadan aýdym aýtdy.
He even did that.	Hatda şeýle etdi.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
What a bad thing!	Bu nähili erbet zat!

This time it will be.	Bu gezek şeýle bolar.
Always have, always will.	Elmydama bar, hemişe bolar.

Wonderful things there.	Şol ýerde ajaýyp zatlar.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili zat ýok.
No words for that.	Munuň üçin söz ýok.
There seems to be nothing here. "	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýok ýaly "-diýdi.
That should be good.	Bu gowy bolmaly.
It would be nice to see more of it.	Ony has köp görmek gowy bolardy.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
He also began to say a few words.	Şeýle hem, ol birnäçe söz aýdyp başlady.
Only, he didn’t have enough time.	Diňe, onuň ýeterlik wagty ýokdy.

It was a good evening.	Gowy agşam boldy.
Man, he was crazy.	Adam, däli boldy.
The word is really close.	Söz hakykatdanam ýakyn.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa gaty ynanamok.
I'm happy about that.	Men muňa begenýärin.
He will come with us.	Ol biziň bilen geler.
This is a serious mistake.	Bu çynlakaý ýalňyşlyk.
I'm not for them.	Men olar üçin däl.
I think they are happy.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar bagtly.
Good news for me.	Meniň üçin gowy habar.
There was no one but him.	Işden başga adam ýokdy.
Maybe someone knows more.	Belki kimdir biri has köp zady biler.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Dogry zady etmegiň wagty.
I haven't seen it before	Men ozal görmedim
Every issue is stupid.	Her mesele samsyk.
Singing makes us happy.	Aýdym aýtmak bizi bagtly edýär.
There is no reason.	Sebäbi ýok.
I do it every day.	Men her gün edýärin.
It has to be somewhere.	Ol bir ýerde bolmaly.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Ol bu hakda gürleşmek islemeýär.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.

It looks great on me.	Maňa gaty gowy görünýär.

Oh, one more thing.	Aý, ýene bir zat.

It could be the same.	Şeýle hem bolup biler.
I still do.	Men henizem edýärin.
For today	Bu gün üçin
Not enough time for that.	Munuň üçin wagt ýeterlik däl.
Had to do it once.	Bir gezek etmeli bolardy.
It was like a mess.	Ol biynjalyk ýalydy.
He will not agree.	Ol muňa razy bolmaz.
I had to do everything myself.	Hemme zady özüm etmeli boldum.
I doubt that.	Men muňa şübhelenýärin.
Of course, this is no longer possible.	Elbetde, bu indi mümkin däl.
This is his job.	Bu onuň işi.
Quick about that, right?	Bu barada çalt, şeýlemi?
That's right.	Dogry.
It's as if he did it himself.	Ony edil özi eden ýaly.

It's too big right now.	Häzirki wagtda gaty uly.
Needless to say.	Muny aýtmak hökman däl.

This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
Good things are really good.	Gowy zatlar hakykatdanam gowy.

I do not agree.	Men muňa razy bolmaz.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.

And then something else.	Soň bolsa başga zat.

Okay, not much.	Bolýar, kän däl.
This morning.	Bu, şu gün irden.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Bu pikir dogry bolmaly.
No one said it would happen.	Hiç kim munuň beýle boljakdygyny aýtmady.
There will be no one else.	Başga biri bolmaz.
I want to answer well.	Gowy jogap bermek isleýärin.
Another issue.	Başga bir mesele.
Summer couldn't take it anymore.	Tomus indi alyp bilmedi.
True, but not very true.	Dogry, ýöne gaty dogry däl.
I don't know what happened to me.	Mende näme bolandygyny bilemok.
Nothing else can be said.	Başga hiç zat aýdyp bolmaz.
Not much time.	Kän wagt ýok.
He needs it.	Oňa mätäç.
Great to see you again	Seni ýene görmek ajaýyp.
Who you are and who you are.	Sen kim we şol.

For a day.	Bir gün üçin.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
He didn't think about it.	Ol ol hakda pikir etmedi.
Something very bad is coming to him.	Oňa gaty gowy däl bir zat gelýär.
That's right.	Dogry.
This book is this book.	Bu kitap şu kitap.

She is very happy.	Ol gaty bagtly.
He must have known.	Ol bilýän bolmaly.
Right now	Şu wagt.
They are very impressed.	Olar gaty haýran.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
There was no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýokdy.
One thing for sure.	Elbetde, bir zat.
With this book.	Bu kitap bilen.
Too many, maybe.	Gaty köp, belki.
There seemed to be someone else.	Başga biri bolmaly ýalydy.

Must be now.	Häzir bolmaly.
He left and returned several times.	Ol gidip, birnäçe gezek gaýdyp geldi.
What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Biziň üçin nähili ajaýyp.

All is well.	Hemmeler gowy.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
There are two suggestions.	Iki teklip bar.
You have to be happy.	Bagtly bolmaly.
We need something new, something new.	Bize täze, täze bir zat gerek.
Very good, probably.	Gaty gowy, ähtimal.
Who doesn't like it.	Kim ony halamaýar.
No one knows.	Muny hiç kim bilmez.
In fact it seems.	Aslynda görünýär.

I don't know about that.	Men bu barada bilemok.
He is better than me today.	Ol şu gün menden has gowy.
This is indeed the case.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle.

In fact there is.	Aslynda bar.
He called the police.	Ol polisiýa jaň etdi.
I really tried.	Men hakykatdanam synap gördüm.
It's too fast.	Ol gaty çalt.
Maybe, maybe.	Belki, belki.
This was not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däldi.
We didn't need that.	Bize beýle zat gerek däldi.
This is not a new issue.	Bu täze mesele däl.
It has been a long way.	Bu uzak ýol boldy.
For the time being.	Wagt üçin.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Hakykatdanam, beýle etmeli däl.
"They are everywhere," he said.	"Olar hemme ýerde" -diýdi.
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
Today was the same day.	Bu gün şol bir gün boldy.
It was like the right time.	Bu dogry wagt ýalydy.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
I didn't have to say that.	Men muny aýtmaly däldim.
I can't take it anymore	Men indi alyp bilemok
This is not easy at all.	Bu asla aňsat däl.
To rest	Dynç almak.
This is not fun at all.	Bu asla gyzykly däl.
This cannot be done.	Muny edip bolmaz.
I never saw it.	Men muny hiç wagt görüp bilmedim.
It takes two.	Iki gerek.
There is really a problem.	Hakykatdanam kynçylyk gelýär.
She can't help herself.	Özüne kömek edip bilmeýär.
He did.	Ol etdi.
Good.	Gowy.
They were still there.	Olar henizem bardy.
I don't want it.	Men ony islämok.
It should be easy to do that.	Muny etmek aňsat bolmaly.
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolardy.
Of course, things should not go that way.	Elbetde, zatlar beýle gitmeli däl.
No one paid attention.	Hiç kim üns bermedi.
This time a girl.	Bu gezek bir gyz.
This will be the last.	Bu iň soňky bolar.
It was a day for him.	Bu onuň üçin bir gün boldy.
He did it for her.	Ol muny onuň üçin etdi.
I could see now.	Men indi görüp bilýärdim.
Now it’s hard to think about it.	Indi bu hakda pikir etmek kyn.
Here's another idea.	Ine, başga bir pikir.
That was never the case for us.	Bu biziň üçin hiç wagt mesele däldi.
He said it was very good news.	Ol bu gaty gowy habar diýdi.
I didn't think much of it.	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmedim.
This is not what he wants.	Bu onuň isleýän zady däl.
Bad things are good.	Erbet zat gowy.
That's a lot of work.	Bu gaty köp iş.
He fed her.	Oňa nahar berdi.
Good day	Gowy gün.
I can't be like you and be someone else.	Men ýaly bolup, başga biri bolup bilemok.
He went too far.	Ol gaty uzak gitdi.
There has to be more to it.	Munuň üçin has köp zat bolmaly.
A long time ago.	Köp wagt ozal.
This is crazy.	Bu däli.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
In fact, I got a call.	Aslynda maňa jaň geldi.
I saw him do that.	Men onuň muny edýändigini gördüm.
This is often the case.	Köplenç şeýle bolýar.
In fact, that year.	Aslynda şol ýyl.
And then there’s the thing to go or go.	Soň bolsa, gitmeli ýa-da gitmeli bir zadyň bar.
I don't think so today.	Bu gün beýle bolmaz öýdemok.
You are a wonderful person.	Sen ajaýyp adam.
He said.	Ol şeýle diýdi.
I saw him do that.	Men onuň muny edýändigini gördüm.
Very good advice for me.	Maňa gaty gowy maslahat.
There was nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýokdy.
It will take several years.	Munuň üçin birnäçe ýyl gerek bolar.
Maybe it would be nice.	Belki gowy bolardy.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
Only those two things.	Diňe şol iki zat.
I need work.	Iş gerek.
.	.
No one wants that.	Hiç kim muny islemeýär.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
I knew he would do it.	Etjekdigini bilýärdim.
I told you the truth.	Men saňa hakykaty aýtdym.
It all started.	Bu zatlar başlady.
Okay, that sounds good.	Bolýar, bu gowy ýaly.
One of the two things will happen now.	Iki zadyň biri indi bolar.
There was someone else in the house.	Öýde başga biri bardy.
I can see the problem.	Meseläni görüp bilýärin.
About bad times.	Erbet wagt hakda.
It's hard for me.	Bu meniň üçin kyn.

Tell me this.	Muny maňa aýdyň.
This may still be the case.	Bu henizem bolup biler.
Only here.	Diňe şu ýerde.
He knew he couldn't do it.	Edip bilmejekdigini bilýärdi.
I think everyone should!	Meniň pikirimçe, hemmeler etmeli!
It must be so good just one night.	Diňe bir gije şeýle gowy bolmaly.
Things were great for them.	Olar üçin zatlar gaty gowy boldy.
All that is needed.	Diňe zerur.
It was not difficult.	Bu gaty kyn däldi.
It started.	Bu başlady.
It's fun to be with her.	Onuň bilen bolmak gyzykly.
The thought troubled him.	Bu pikir ony biynjalyk etdi.
In fact, this is not true.	Aslynda bu dogry däl.
It's just not possible to do that.	Diňe munuň ýaly etmegi mümkin däl.
I know this is not the right thing to do.	Munuň dogry zat däldigini bilýärin.
Can anyone suggest something that can help?	Kömek edip biljek bir zady teklip edip biljek barmy?
Not about that.	Bu hakda däl.
It's something else.	Ol başga bir zat.
There could be another problem.	Başga bir mesele bolup biler.
It shouldn't be too hard.	Gaty kyn bolmaly däl.
There is nothing about being human.	Adam bolmak hakda hiç zat ýok.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
This can never happen.	Bu hiç wagt bolup bilmez.
The future, more.	Geljek, has köp zat.
He did not want to pay attention.	Üns bermek islemedi.
He did such a good job.	Şeýle gowy iş etdi.
Today is a beautiful day, isn't it?	Bu gün owadan gün, şeýlemi?
No one could say.	Hiç kim aýdyp bilmedi.
It was great.	Gaty gowy boldy.
He thought to himself.	Ol özüni pikir etdi.
You have to do this.	Bu işi etmeli.
That morning.	Şol gün irden.
I have it now.	Indi mende bar.
You will need it.	Size gerek bolar.
It was not for me.	Bu meniň üçin däldi.
She is really happy.	Ol hakykatdanam bagtly.

It may take some time.	Biraz wagt alyp biler.
Ol.	Ol.
Not really smart.	Dogry akylly däl.

I hope it helps.	Kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
Happy for him.	Onuň üçin bagtly.
I want that.	Men muny isleýärin.
I knew nothing about them.	Men olar hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
Not so much.	Näçe däl.
I don't have to do that	Men muny etmeli däl
I can't help you	Size kömek edip bilemok
There is a problem.	Mesele bar.
Of course I didn't.	Elbetde, beýle etmedim.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
Therefore.	Şonuň üçin.
I still hope it is complete.	Entek doly diýip umyt edýärin.

What a difficult decision!	Bu nähili kyn karar!
To do something	Bir zatlar etmek
Now he is	Indi ol.
It was good for them.	Bu olar üçin gowy boldy.
Something would happen now.	Häzirki wagtda bir zat bolardy.
There was no reason.	Sebäp ýokdy.
There, somewhere.	Şol ýerde, bir ýerde.
So there was one before.	Şonuň üçin mundan ozal biri bardy.
Of course not together.	Elbetde bilelikde däl.
Definitely a lie.	Elbetde, ýalan.
He advised me.	Ol maňa maslahat berdi.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
How much is this	Bu näçe?
It was very difficult for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty kyn boldy.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Interesting, wonderful things.	Gyzykly, ajaýyp zatlar.
Like a few days.	Birnäçe gün ýaly.
I hope we can.	Bileris diýip umyt edýärin.
We can do that, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Muny edip bileris "-diýdi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu kim.
Does he even know?	Ol hatda bilýärmi?
In fact, they are not the same thing.	Aslynda olar bir zat däl.
Everyone says that.	Muny hemmeler aýdýar.
It is not right to do so.	Muny etmek dogry däl.
This is not a good thing at all.	Bu düýbünden gowy zat däl.
I don't want any problems.	Men hiç hili kynçylyk islämok.
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
It took a lot of work.	Bu işe köp iş gitdi.
There can be several reasons.	Birnäçe sebäp bolup biler.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Aslynda beýle bolmaly däl.
He would be happy for the first time.	Ol ilkinji gezek bagtly bolardy.
In your opinion.	Siziň pikiriňizçe.

And then it's not too hard.	Soň bolsa ol gaty kyn däl.
Maybe this will help.	Belki bu kömek eder.
She looked very young.	Ol gaty ýaş ýalydy.
Nor will it be.	Şeýle hem bolmaz.
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly mümkinçilik ýok.

Then three more.	Soň ýene üç.
Now there are many questions to ask.	Indi bu ýerde bermeli köp sorag bar.
I know this can't be easy.	Munuň aňsat bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärin.
I gave him the money.	Men oňa pul berdim.
It was not to be known.	Muny bilmek däldi.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman bolmaz.
He will not worry.	Oňa alada bolmaz.
Nothing, nothing, nothing.	Hiç zat, hiç zat, hiç zat.
I know enough.	Men ýeterlik bilýärin.
They will be very complete.	Olar gaty doly bolar.

It was very possible.	Bu gaty mümkin boldy.
Of course, the correct answer is not necessarily.	Elbetde, dogry jogap hökman däl.
Not much.	Kän zat ýok.
He could not help it.	Ol muňa kömek edip bilmedi.
The biggest challenge is coming.	Iň uly kynçylyk gelýär.
I have no such thing.	Mende beýle zat ýok.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
They are something else.	Olar başga bir zat.
It seems so stupid.	Bu gaty samsyk ýaly.
It will not be so.	Şeýle bolmaz.
You can do this yourself.	Muny özüňiz edip bilersiňiz.
I got another one.	Başga birini aldym.
I sang about it.	Bu hakda aýdym.
I did a very bad job.	Men gaty erbet iş etdim.
Police arrived.	Polisiýa geldi.
He took me.	Ol meni aldy.

I tried it several times.	Birnäçe gezek synap gördüm.
Excuse me, what is this.	Bagyşlaň, bu näme.
He can be a very difficult person.	Ol gaty kyn adam bolup biler.
It is impossible to do anything else.	Başga zatlar etmek mümkin däl.
It was really great.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp boldy.
I know, it's not good to say that.	Bilýärin, muny aýtmak gowy däl.
This will not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaz.
It's more beautiful there.	Ol ýerde has owadan.
Why not?	Näme üçin beýle etmeli däl?
Money is not everything.	Pul hemme zat däl.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe şeýle boldy.
I've seen it a lot.	Men muny köp gördüm.
It will be bad.	Bu erbet bolar.
Of course, that didn't help.	Elbetde, bu kömek etmedi.

Oh, no.	Aý, ýok.
Police arrived.	Polisiýa geldi.

There were three people against me.	Maňa garşy üç adam bardy.
Okay, for us.	Bolýar, biziň üçin.
It will be.	Bu bolar.
He will not be at home.	Ol öýde bolmaz.
Maybe it will be good.	Belki gowy bolar.
He has been here a long time.	Ol bu ýerde köp wagt boldy.
There was enough time to go.	Gitmek üçin ýeterlik wagt bardy.
Everyone is happy, very happy.	Hemmeler bagtly, gaty bagtly.
It's been a long time coming.	Uzak wagt geldi.
He is a good man.	Ol gowy adam.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He was surprised.	Ol muňa geň galdy.
In fact, there was nothing he could do about it.	Aslynda onuň üçin edip biljek zady ýokdy.
This seems to be a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk bar ýaly bolup görünýär.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
He responded quickly.	Ol çalt jogap berdi.
This should not be the case.	Bu mesele bolmaly däl.
This is not the case either.	Bu hem däl.
I did not object.	Men muňa garşy däldim.
Damage.	Zyýan.
It can't happen anymore.	Indi bolup bilmez.
There is no answer to that.	Munuň üçin jogap ýok.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
It would be a better time.	Has gowy wagt bolardy.
This time it was not bad.	Bu gezek erbet däldi.
I will think about it further.	Bu barada mundan beýläk pikir ederin.
You really need it	Size gaty zerur
Nothing.	Hiç hili zat ýok.
He wanted to.	Ol isledi.
He can help here.	Ol bu ýerde kömek edip biler.

I don’t want to do these things.	Men bu zatlary etmek islämok.
This is a really good thing, really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy zat, hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
One is never enough.	Biri hiç wagt ýeterlik däl.
I've never done that before.	Men ozal beýle zady etmedim.

You have to do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly etmeli.
Of course, it's close here.	Elbetde, bu ýerde ýakyn.

They are just beautiful.	Olar diňe owadan.

That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolardy.

It’s a pleasure he will never know again.	Mundan beýläk hiç wagt bilmez ýaly lezzet.

Of course, there was a better life elsewhere.	Elbetde, başga bir ýerde has gowy durmuş bardy.
It won’t be his last, but he doesn’t know it yet.	Bu onuň iň soňky bolmaz, ýöne entek muny bilenok.

There could be a way.	Bir ýol bolup biler.
He asked what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny sorady.
I'd like to see more.	Has köp zady görmek isleýärin.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda şu gün iki gezek görmek ýeterlik.
We can't answer that.	Biz muňa jogap berip bilmeris.
It needs to be completely eradicated.	Oňa düýbünden ýok etmeli.
The problem is different.	Mesele başga.
It also comes back beautifully and wonderfully.	Şeýle hem, ajaýyp we geň gaýdyp gelýär.

This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
I told her calm down and we would take care of her.	Men oňa hiç zat etmeli däldigini aýtdym.
He wanted to help.	Kömek bermek isledi.
When needed	Haçan gerek bolsa.
Of course, there was something.	Elbetde, bir zat bardy.
With them now.	Häzirki wagtda olar bilen.
He said he wanted to buy.	Satyn almak isleýändigini aýtdy.
When did this happen?	Bu haçan boldy?
There was always something.	Elmydama bir zat bardy.
Of course, this was not true.	Elbetde, bu düýbünden dogry däldi.
Will be back tomorrow.	Ertir gaýdyp geler.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
At the moment.	Häzirki wagtda.
We can't go home anymore.	Indi ikimizem öýe gaýdyp bilmeris.
No one is coming.	Hiç kim gelenok.
That's how life is.	Durmuş şeýle boldy.
I still want to.	Men henizem isleýärin.
That can't be the case.	Bu kän bir ýaly bolup bilmez.
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýok.
I have never tried it.	Hiç haçan synap görmedim.
It's fun, but it's a lot.	Bu gyzykly, ýöne köp bolýar.
There.	Ol ýerde.
There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
Coming home.	Öýüne gelýär.
I don't want to suggest anything else.	Başga bir zat teklip etmek islämok.
Not everything is new.	Hemme zat täze däl.
Just what can happen.	Diňe näme bolup biler.
You didn't have to be happy.	Bagtly bolmak hökman däldi.
Something big happened.	Uly bir zat boldy.
This is good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy.
No one can take it from you.	Hiç kim senden alyp bilmez.
It won't be long for me.	Bu meniň üçin uzak bolmaz.
Because it will definitely happen.	Sebäbi hökman bolar.
He is close.	Ol ýakyn.
It's about me, man.	Bu meniň üçin adam hakda.
Not necessarily in one place.	Hökman bir ýerde däl.
He didn't have to do anything.	Hiç zat etmeli däldi.
This is good news and bad news.	Bu gowy habar we erbet habar.
He is not.	Ol ýok.
He knows something.	Ol bir zady bilýär.
I'm not that good.	Men beýle bir gowy däl.
Tell me something else.	Maňa başga bir zat aýdyň.
I will not be there	Men ol ýerde bolmaz
He tells me everything.	Ol maňa hemme zady aýdýar.
This was not a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý zat däldi.
He still does.	Ol henizem şeýle etdi.
This is his job.	Bu onuň işi.
A lot of people went to work.	Köp adam işe gitdi.
It doesn't take weeks or months.	Birnäçe hepde ýa-da aý gerek däl.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
The moon looks great tonight.	Aý şu gije uly ýaly görünýär.
I know again.	Men ýene bir gezek bilýärin.
We.	We.
He thought it was good.	Gowy diýip pikir etdi.
You are the best	Sen iň gowy.
No one can do that for us.	Hiç kim muny biziň üçin edip bilmez.
Someone else if necessary.	Gerek bolsa başga biri.
I wonder if he was here.	Men onuň şu ýerde bolandygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny bilýärin.
There was nothing else for them here.	Bu ýerde olar üçin başga zat ýokdy.
Of course, there is no problem.	Elbetde, mesele ýok.
I thought it was something like that.	Munuň ýaly bir zat diýip pikir etdim.
It will never happen.	Bu asla bolmaz.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
It's not just me.	Muny diňe men däl.
It is not good for anyone to have too much.	Hiç zadyň köp bolmagy hiç kim üçin gowy däl.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
You have to do this every day.	Muny her gün etmeli.
He really had to go.	Ol hakykatdanam gitmeli boldy.
I can't get it	Men muny alyp bilemok
It was not good.	Gowy däldi.
I was not really happy.	Men hakykatdanam bagtly däldim.
There must be something wrong.	Biraz ýalňyşlyk bolmaly.
There was no other option.	Başga mümkinçilik ýokdy.
Oh! 	Aý!
So we can't say that.	Şonuň üçin bu hiç zat diýip bilmeris.
I'm not against it.	Men oňa garşy däl.
There was no police.	Polisiýa ýokdy.
I thought it was weird to say that.	Muny aýtmak gaty geň zat diýip pikir etdim.
We don't need more.	Bize has köp zat gerek däl.
No one cared and didn't care.	Hiç kim alada etmedi we üns bermedi.
I haven't seen much.	Men kän görmedim.
I knew something was wrong.	Bir zadyň dogry däldigini bilýärdim.
He agreed and admitted.	Ol razy boldy we boýun aldy.
He started giving it to me.	Ol maňa berip başlady.
Maybe not so good.	Belki beýle gowy däl.
I often do.	Men köplenç edýärin.
And then there was enough time for that.	Soň bolsa munuň üçin ýeterlik wagt bardy.
He can say whatever he wants.	Islän zadyny aýdyp biler.
It's really bad.	Ol hakykatdanam erbet.
He did just that.	Edil şonuň ýaly etdi.
I am not now.	Men häzir däl.
This was not what he had always wanted.	Bu onuň hiç wagt islän zady däldi.
I was not good enough for him.	Men oňa ýeterlik däldi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki, meni birneme biynjalyk eden bolsa gerek.
It's hard to know.	Muny bilmek kyn.
He was not the only one who made a mistake here.	Ol bu ýerde ýalňyşlyk eden ýeke-täk adam däldi.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Of course.	Elbetde.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
He had to make a decision.	Bir karar bermeli boldy.
Of course, this is not the case.	Elbetde, bu mesele däl.
This book is definitely interesting.	Bu kitap elbetde gyzykly.
It has been a long and long way.	Bu uzak we uzak ýol boldy.
I think these are the best things.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu iň gowy zatlar.
This is the way.	Bu ýol.
That was not the case before.	Öň beýle däldi.
He was very busy.	Özüni gaty meşgul etdi.
I want to be right.	Dogry etmek isleýärin.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu gaty gowy.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat gowy.
They were everywhere.	Olar hemme ýerde bardy.
Not too much.	Gaty köp däl.
Probably just one or two.	Mümkin, diňe ýekeje ikisi.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
I didn't see it that badly.	Men muny beýle erbet görmedim.
There is something for everyone here.	Bu ýerde hemmeler üçin bir zat bar.
The question will be when.	Sorag haçan bolar.
I know, because it happened to me.	Bilýärin, sebäbi bu meniň bilen boldy.
At home.	Öýde.
He didn't want to be who he was.	Ol kim bolmak islemedi.
I know what he will do.	Men onuň näme etjekdigini bilýärin.
Why is that? 	Näme üçin beýle?
Things happen, life happens.	Bolýan zatlar bolýar, durmuş bolýar.
He did not report it.	Ol muny habar bermedi.
This will be the case.	Bu şeýle bolar.
This is a great opportunity.	Bu uly mümkinçilik.
He didn't say much.	Ol kän zat aýtmady.
Do something else.	Başga bir zat et.
Nothing for you.	Seniň üçin hiç zat ýok.
This is his job.	Bu onuň işi.
This was not a request.	Bu haýyş däldi.
Not there.	Ol ýerde ýok.
Long time no see	Uzak wagt.
He borrowed.	Ol karz aldy.
Oh, very good.	Aý, gaty gowy.
In fact, he didn't.	Aslynda ol hem etmedi.
I think it won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz öýdýän.
He did it three times.	Ol muny üç gezek etdi.
I didn't want to talk to him anymore.	Indi onuň bilen gürleşmek islemedim.
That was never enough for me.	Bu meniň üçin hiç wagt ýeterlik däldi.
He did not decide.	Ol karar bermedi.
He must have thought about it before.	Ozal bu barada pikir eden bolmaly.
Not me.	Maňa däl.
Maybe he can't see anything.	Belki, ol hiç zady görüp bilmez.
Most reported.	Iň köp habar berdi.
Maybe this will help.	Belki bu kömek eder.
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
I knew it.	Men muny bilýärdim.
No one did.	Hiç biri etmedi.
There is no one else to help me.	Maňa kömek etjek başga adam ýok.
Also.	Şeýle hem.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu beýle däl ýaly.
He allowed it, he knew it.	Oňa rugsat berdi, muny bilýärdi.
I thought it was good.	Gowy diýip pikir etdim.
I didn't think about it.	Men bu barada hiç zat pikir etmedim.
Enough to see.	Görmek üçin ýeterlik.
I don't know what that will be like.	Munuň nähili boljakdygyny bilemok.
I do not know.	Men bilemok.
He didn't know how.	Nädip bilýändigini bilmedi.
The good man is coming back.	Gowy adam gaýdyp gelýär.
He is there now.	Häzir ol ýerde.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle.
Tell me now.	Häzir aýdyň.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
Of course it came.	Elbetde, geldi.
He left that night.	Ol şol gije gitdi.
He did it several times.	Birnäçe gezek etdi.
You have to do better.	Munuň üçin has gowy iş etmeli.
It will be good now.	Häzir gowy bolar.
In fact, I don't think so.	Aslynda beýle pikir etmeýärin.
Often you can do this yourself.	Köplenç muny özüňiz edip bilersiňiz.
That's a good idea.	Bu gaty gowy pikir.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Ol munuň hökman däldigini bilýärdi.
He did nothing.	Ol hiç zat etmedi.
It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
I had so much fun doing that.	Muny etmek üçin gaty hezil boldum.
He started telling me what happened that day.	Ol maňa şol gün näme bolandygyny aýdyp başlady.
The answer is not clear.	Jogap aýdyň däl.
This is what.	Bu, näme.
And you are the only one	Sen bolsa diňe
He was surprised to see her.	Ony görüp geň galdy.
He must be right.	Ol dogry bolmaly.
Is there anyone there?	Ol ýerde kimdir biri barmy?
They are fast and really easy.	Olar çalt we hakykatdanam aňsat.
I am a young girl, I am a young girl.	Men ýaş gyz, ýaş gyz men.
As before.	Öňküsi ýaly.
Maybe too much.	Belki gaty köp.
He thought it was great too.	Ol hem gaty gowy diýip pikir etdi.
He fell asleep immediately.	Ol derrew uklap galdy.
This is still the case.	Bu henizem.
Today he lives another day.	Bu gün başga bir gün ýaşaýar.
It's really hard to make it interesting.	Aslynda muny gyzykly etmeli gaty kyn.
This time is very close.	Bu wagt gaty ýakyn.
He didn't seem to be able to go.	Ol hakykatdanam gidip bilmeýän ýalydy.
First and last and only.	Ilkinji we iň soňky we diňe.
He never received an answer.	Ol hiç haçan jogap alyp bilmedi.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda bu zatlary özi etmeýär.
I know, because that's what happened to me.	Bilýärin, sebäbi meniň bilen şeýle boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hakykatdanam bu hakda.
Good word	Gowy söz.
It won't happen.	Ol bolmaz.
Where did he go?	Ol nirä gitdi?
He could not allow himself to think so.	Özüniň beýle pikir etmegine ýol berip bilmedi.
Because someone must be.	Sebäbi kimdir biri hökman bolmaly.
Just for today.	Diňe şu gün üçin.
It will be very bad.	Bu gaty erbet bolar.
No one.	Hiç kim ýok.
Seeing this happen, he did nothing.	Munuň hem bolandygyny görüp, hiç zat etmedi.
Almost no one knew about you.	Hiç kim sen hakda bilmeýärdi diýen ýaly.
And then the girl.	Soň bolsa gyz.
You can also ask questions.	Sorag hem berip bilersiňiz.
It was just now.	Diňe şu wagt bardy.
There was no police.	Hiç hili polisiýa ýokdy.
So we have to go.	Şonuň üçin biz gitmeli.
Not just for me.	Diňe meniň üçin däl.
He said another time.	Başga bir wagt aýtdy.
Too hard, too full.	Gaty gaty, özi bilen doly.
Not much.	Kän däl.
He seemed to want to help her.	Oňa kömek etmek isleýän ýalydy.
I really trust you.	Men saňa hakykatdanam ynanýaryn.
It is a good thing to be.	Bolmak gowy mesele.
I have never seen anything like it.	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim.
Not yet.	Entek däl.
He was not much.	Ol köp adam däldi.
This purchase will be my last.	Bu satyn almak meniň iň soňky bolar.
Then there was something.	Soň bir zat bardy.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
And now there is.	Indi bolsa bar.
It only took one time.	Diňe bir gezek gerek boldy.
They are also new.	Olar hem täze.
Now you can.	Indi edip bilersiňiz.
In fact, I didn't know what to expect.	Aslynda munuň näme bolup biljekdigini bilmeýärdim.
He even says time.	Hatda wagty hem aýdýar.
I want you now	Men seni häzir isleýärin
It's fast enough.	Ol ýeterlik çalt.
This is a very difficult task.	Bu gaty kyn iş.
It's been a week.	Bir hepde boldy.
Why do you think this happened?	Siziň pikiriňizçe näme üçin beýle boldy?
I'm fine with it.	Men onuň bilen gowy.
This is different.	Bu başga.
How was that?	Bu nähili boldy.
This is a serious proposal.	Bu çynlakaý teklip.
No problem.	Kynçylyk ýok.
He didn't do that.	Ol beýle zat etmedi.
Everything is fast here.	Bu ýerde hemme zat çalt bolýar.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Munuň öz hakykaty bar.
I know this is not good.	Munuň gowy däldigini bilýärin.
We are close.	Biz ýakyn.
That's exactly what happened here.	Edil şu ýerde bolup geçen zat.
You can't help it.	Oňa kömek edip bolmaz.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
He obeyed.	Ol boýun boldy.
There are usually two possibilities.	Köplenç iki mümkinçilik bar.
Good, but not very good.	Gowy, ýöne gaty gowy däl.
Someone is right.	Kimdir biri dogry aýdýar.
It can't be.	Ol bolup bilmez.
It has been around for many years.	Köp ýyl bäri gelýär.
In fact, it could be worse.	Aslynda bu erbet bolup biler.
There is no reason.	Sebäbi ýok.
There is only one thing.	Diňe ýekeje zat bar.
So that's always the case.	Şonuň üçin elmydama şeýle bolýar.
He allowed it.	Ol muňa ýol berdi.
I will arrest you.	Men seni tussag ederin.
It seemed impossible.	Bu nähili mümkin däl ýalydy.
A few days ago.	Birnäçe gün öň.
I can only advise.	Men diňe maslahat berip bilerin.
What a bad day!	Bu nähili erbet gün!
If this is often the case.	Bu köplenç bir mesele bolsa.
In fact, it may not be possible.	Aslynda mümkin däl bolmagy mümkin.
That's the way it is.	Ine, şonuň ýaly.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
This was never true.	Bu hiç haçan dogry däldi.
He didn't think of anything else.	Başga zat hakda pikir etmedi.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
He took me away.	Ol meni alyp gitdi.
She must have known she wasn't a girl.	Ol özüniň gyz däldigini hökman bilýärdi.
Good guy	Gowy ýigit.
I could never do that.	Men muny hiç haçan edip bilmedim.
I have a question.	Mende bir sorag bar.
He wanted it for another reason.	Başga bir sebäp bilen muny isledi.
I'll be there and.	Men ol ýerde bolaryn we.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
I saw it quickly.	Men muny çalt gördüm.
There is no girl in the house anymore.	Öýde indi gyz ýok.
He rested for a week.	Ol bir hepde dynç aldy.
I have to go to work.	Men işe gitmeli.
Really bad.	Hakykatdanam erbet.
You need a better book.	Size has gowy kitap gerek.
I just want to make the best decision.	Diňe iň gowy karar bermek isleýärin.
I didn't think much.	Kän pikir etmedim.
It's been two years.	Iki ýyl boldy.
Almost everyone.	Hemmeler diýen ýaly.
He gave her something.	Oňa bir zatlar berdi.
There was not much else for him.	Onuň üçin başga köp zat ýokdy.
He left just like he did.	Ol edil özi ýaly gitdi.
This is new.	Bu täze.
I knew what he wanted.	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärdim.
There is no reason.	Sebäbi ýok.
He has nothing.	Onuň hiç zady ýok.
In fact there is.	Aslynda bar.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
This is how it should be this year.	Bu ýyl şeýle bolmaly.
I didn't want to be arrested.	Meni tussag etmek islemedim.
An idea immediately came to his mind.	Derrew oňa bir pikir geldi.
I think that's all.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hemme zat.
OK, it's for you.	Bolýar, siziň üçin bar.
Good.	Gowy.
There is a lot going on here.	Bu ýerde köp zat bolýar.
Not much, but it should be two or three.	Köp gerek däl, ýöne iki ýa-da üç bolmaly.
He thought he was a good man.	Ol gowy adam diýip pikir etdi.
I didn't know that.	Muny bilmeýärdim.
I was so bad.	Men gaty erbet boldum.
It could be.	Ol bolup biler.
There is no news.	Hiç haçan habar ýok.
This year is nothing new.	Bu ýyl täze zat däl.
I don't do that	Men muny etmeýärin
So it is not interesting.	Şonuň üçin bu gyzykly däl.
She couldn't go anymore.	Ol indi gidip bilmedi.
No one can take it from you.	Hiç kim muny senden alyp bilmez.
Until then, always.	Oňa çenli, hemişe.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Belki, bu gowy zat.
He was like.	Ol ýalydy.
I know, but the question is why.	Bilýärin, ýöne sorag näme üçin.
So he will definitely be back here.	Şonuň üçin hökman şu ýere gaýdyp geler.
You can only do this for me.	Muny diňe meniň üçin edip bilersiňiz.
I could be more, better.	Men has köp, has gowy bolup bilerin.
There is no book I can do for you.	Siziň üçin edip biljek kitap ýok.
Okay, okay, that's not right.	Bolýar, bolýar, bu dogry däl.
There will be no problem.	Kynçylyk bolmaz.
I haven't seen it yet	Men entek görmedim
This watch made us so.	Bu sagat bizi şeýle etdi.
That could be the case.	Bu şeýle bolup biler.
The next one is short.	Indiki gysga.
I don't have to tell anyone.	Hiç kime aýtmaly däl.
I heard it was great.	Gaty gowy diýip eşitdim.
It was not for me.	Bu meniň üçin däldi.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman dogry däl.
This is a really good thing.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy zat.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I want it all.	Men hemmesini isleýärin.
We can do this in two ways.	Muny iki ýol bilen edip bileris.
She doesn't know what could happen to her.	Oňa näme bolup biljekdigini bilenok.
This is not a big deal.	Bu uly bir zat däl.
I told her, but it's good.	Oňa aýtdym, ýöne gowy.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
There is a lot about that.	Bu hakda köp zatlar bar.
That began to seem strange.	Munuň özi geň bolup başlady.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Dogry däli zat.
Maybe I'll be back tonight.	Belki, şu gije gaýdyp bilerin.
Okay.	Bolýar.
He could not do anything happier.	Ol bagtly zady edip bilmedi.
Not available for several years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri ýok.
I never wanted to hurt you.	Hiç haçan saňa zyýan bermek islemedim.
I don't know anything about that.	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilemok.
Maybe there is.	Belki bar bolmagy mümkin.
This is no longer the case.	Bu indi mesele däl.
You have to stop this now.	Muny indi bes etmeli.
Of course.	Elbetde.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
This is great for me.	Bu meniň üçin ajaýyp.
Only then.	Diňe şol wagt.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
I couldn't, I couldn't.	Men edip bilmedim, edip bilmedim.
For several years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri.
What if	Näme bolsa?
It took a while.	Birneme wagt gerek boldy.
Like everything.	Hemme zat ýaly.
For a big reason.	Uly sebäp üçin.
It would be crazy.	Bu däli bolar.
That weekend	Şol dynç güni.
Someone can help if needed.	Kimdir biri zerur bolsa kömek edip biler.
He called.	Jaň etdi.
It was really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn boldy.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
I don't want to go there.	Men ol ýere gitmek islämok.
As beautiful as it is now.	Edil häzirki ýaly ajaýyp.
It's easy at home.	Öýde bu aňsat.
It will definitely be.	Bu hökman bolar.
He did more.	Ol has köp zat etdi.
There was no way to do that.	Munuň üçin mümkinçilik ýokdy.
If it's not one thing, it's another.	Bu bir zat däl bolsa, başga zat.
Worse.	Has erbet.
Which is not bad, but it's not good either.	Haýsy erbet däl, ýöne bu hem gowy däl.
Really	Hakykatdanam.
It seemed good.	Gowy ýalydy.
It could be the same.	Şeýle hem bolup biler.
Can you give me some money?	Maňa pul berip bilersiňizmi?
He only makes money.	Diňe pul edýär.
Police work.	Polisiýa işi.
This is something else.	Bu başga zat.
It will be interesting to see.	Görmek gyzykly bolar.
Not this time.	Bu gezek däl.
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
The same can be said here.	Bu ýerde hem şeýle bolup biler.
He bought a book.	Ol kitap satyn aldy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilenok.
There will be time for that.	Munuň üçin wagt bolar.
The two are absolutely the same.	Ikisi düýbünden bir zat.
They are very good.	Olar gaty gowy.
As you wish.	Ony islän ýaly.
He is a bad man.	Ol erbet adam.
Doing the right thing.	Dogry etmek.
This is true right now.	Bu häzirki wagtda dogry.
He doesn't like anyone.	Ol hiç kimi halamaýar.
Life, then nothing.	Durmuş, soň hiç zat.
This is still a lie.	Bu henizem ýalan.
I am young	Men ýaş
I don't want you	Men seni islämok
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şeýle boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şol bir zat.
You are one	Sen bir.
The same can be said here.	Bu ýerde hem edil şonuň ýaly aýdyp bolar.
Only one is coming.	Diňe biri gelýär.
I haven't seen him in months.	Men ony birnäçe aý bäri görmedim.
He can be of great help to us.	Ol bize uly kömek edip biler.
Of course you know.	Elbetde bilýärsiň.
Bar.	Bar.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Everyone knows now.	Her kim indi bilýär.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
A long time ago.	Köp wagt mundan ozal.
He didn't really care.	Aslynda ol hakda alada etmedi.
One or two.	Bir ýa-da iki.
To make it big.	Uly etmek üçin.
It was never about me.	Bu hiç wagt men hakda däldi.
It's easy to do that.	Muny etmek aňsat.
Of course, tonight.	Elbetde, bu agşam.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
It happened to me too.	Bu hem meniň bilen boldy.
They are stupid.	Olar samsyk.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle etmedi.
In fact, this is the only problem.	Aslynda bu ýeke-täk mesele.
This book looks interesting.	Bu kitap gyzykly görünýär.
You are still	Sen henizem sen.
I had.	Mende bardy.
Only two did not vote.	Diňe ikisi ses bermedi.
I am the best.	Men iň gowy.
I've never done that before.	Men muny öň hiç wagt etmedim.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
There were several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bardy.
He could not go.	Ol gidip bilmedi.
I will not be as happy as before.	Men mundan öňküsi ýaly bagtly bolmaz.
I will be close	Men ýakyn bolaryn
No one else can do it for you.	Başga hiç kim seniň üçin edip bilmez.
It's too young.	Bu gaty ýaş.
He is with her.	Ol onuň bilen.

It doesn't make me feel bad or anything.	Bu meni erbet ýa-da başga bir zat etmeýär.

This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
This is the problem.	Bu mesele şu.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
I am against it.	Men muňa garşy.

The time is near.	Wagt ýakyn.
Say nothing about me.	Men hakda hiç zat aýtmak.
It was great.	Bu ajaýyp boldy.
To see	Görmek.

She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
What a question.	Bu nähili sorag.
The police were shocked.	Polisiýa geň galdy.
It keeps you busy.	Bu sizi meşgul edýär.
I couldn't do that.	Men muny edip bilmedim.
He is not human.	Ol adam däl.

Just for one thing.	Diňe bir zat üçin.
He made no mistake about it.	Ol görüp biljek hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedi.
I couldn't do that.	Men muny edip bilmedim.
He will perish.	Ol ýok bolar.
It was not good with him.	Bu onuň bilen gowy däldi.
If only he could see.	Diňe görüp bilýän bolsa.
No one wanted to do that.	Hiç kim muny etmek islemedi.
He thought he didn't like me.	Ol meni halamaýar diýen pikir berdi.
This is not the first time.	Ilkinji gezek däl.
I have only one hope.	Mende diňe bir umyt bar.
We don't need to talk.	Bize gürleşmek gerek däl.
I had to.	Men etmeli boldum.
"It's not like that," he said.	Ol: "Aslynda beýle däl" -diýdi.

With someone else.	Başga biri bilen.

I'm not going to do anything stupid.	Men samsyk zat etjek däl.
This is just one.	Bu diňe bir.
He didn't have to be here.	Ol bu ýerde bolmaly däldi.
He had to do that.	Muny etmeli boldy.
It seems easy.	Bu aňsat ýaly.
I don't need it.	Maňa gerek däl.
He does too.	Ol hem edýär.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
I hope so.	Şeýle bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
I wondered why it was too late.	Näme üçin gijä galdy diýip pikir etdim.
There is something here.	Bu ýerde bir zat bar.
That was not the case.	Bu mesele däldi.
I have never seen a place like this before.	Men hiç wagt beýle ýerde görmedim.

I didn't care so much.	Men beýle alada etmedim.
It's a wonderful night.	Bu ajaýyp gije.
He could do nothing now.	Indi hiç zat edip bilmedi.
This is not a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat däl.
He was no more.	Ol indi ýokdy.
That was not enough for us.	Bu biziň üçin ýeterlik däldi.
Not much.	Köp däl.
Tomorrow will be another difficult day.	Ertir ýene bir kyn gün bolar.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
In fact, there was always.	Aslynda, elmydama bardy.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
There is nothing else to talk about.	Başga gürleşmek üçin başga zat ýok.
I've been here for a month.	Men bu ýerde bir aý.
This is possible for me.	Meniň üçin bu mümkin.
He went to work.	Ol işe gitdi.
Two years ago.	Iki ýyl öň.
Something similar happened at home last weekend.	Geçen dynç güni öýde edil şonuň ýaly zat.
He took her home.	Ony öýüne alyp gitdi.
There are a lot of people.	Adam köp.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Dogry bolmak gaty gowy bolsa, ähtimal.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
This is his reality.	Bu onuň hakykaty.
This is not a bad idea anymore.	Indi bu erbet pikir däl.

Life is good!	Durmuş gowy!.

This decision seems really strange.	Bu karar hakykatdanam geň görünýär.
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
This is a very bad thing.	Bu gaty erbet zat.
He just wanted to know what he knew.	Diňe onuň bilýändigini bilmek isledi.
You know that.	Muny gowy bilýärsiň.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
Not true.	Dogry däl.
This can always be the best way for me to be alone.	Bu meniň üçin hemişe onuň iň gowy ýeke galmagy bolup biler.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
That should be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolmaly.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
Of course, there was no time for that.	Elbetde, munuň üçin wagt ýokdy.

OK, that's enough.	Bolýar, ýeterlik.

There was no sound in the house.	Öýde ses ýokdy.

Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
They would be somewhere else.	Olar düýbünden başga bir ýerde bolardy.
He wanted to give her everything.	Oňa hemme zady bermek isledi.
He likes a lot.	Ol köp zady halaýar.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Where did he go?	Ol nirä gitdi?
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň özi hezil edýär.
You can do the same.	Şeýle hem edip bilersiňiz.
I think that's a bad thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu erbet zat.
You and I can still be.	Sen we men, henizem bolup biler.

Now everything would be fine.	Indi hemme zat gowy bolardy.
I was not ready to go.	Men gitmäge taýyn däldim.

Something else is wrong with me.	Meniň bilen başga zat.
Me.	Ine.

He knew better now.	Ol indi has gowy bilýärdi.
Of course, he is still young.	Elbetde, ol henizem ýaş.

Many people are difficult.	Köp adam kyn.

I got the message.	Habar aldym.
He must be crazy.	Ol däli bolmaly.
She sings beautifully.	Ol owadan aýdym aýdýar.

Looks like you shouldn't.	Etmeli däl ýaly bolup görünýär.
You have to do this every year.	Muny her ýyl etmeli.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
It shouldn't have gone like this.	Munuň ýaly gitmeli däldi.
I did not know	Men bilmedim
No one told him to do it.	Hiç kim oňa muny etmegi aýtmady.
He will too.	Ol hem eder.
I do bad things.	Men erbet zatlar edýärin.
There is a reason for this.	Munuň bir sebäbi bar.
You don't need to.	Size gerek däl.
It was not good.	Gowy däldi.
You are great at that.	Siz muňa ajaýyp.
You can do that for me.	Muny meniň üçin edip bilersiňiz.
The help was right.	Kömek dogry boldy.
I haven't seen so much in one place.	Bir ýerde beýle köp görmedim.
It was not much money.	Bu has köp pul däldi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
We are here.	Biz şu ýerde.
This is his job.	Bu onuň işi.
He never wanted it.	Ol muny hiç haçan islemedi.
They are a book for me.	Meniň üçin olar kitap.
Do it	Muny et.
I don't need it.	Ol maňa gerek däl.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I thought about you.	Men sen hakda pikir etdim.
I just can't tell you.	Diňe saňa aýdyp biljek däl.
I thought about it.	Men bu barada pikir etdim.
Strange things.	Geň zatlar.
No one was hurt.	Hiç kim zyýan bermedi.
Only today is such a day.	Diňe şu gün şeýle gün bolýar.
It was like nothing at the time.	Şol wagt hiç zat ýaly däldi.
There is someone there who can help you.	Ol ýerde size kömek edip biljek biri bar.
I couldn't care less.	Men alada edip bilmedim.
You don't have to do that.	Şeýle etmeli däl.
I saw it.	Men muny gördüm.
Because she is beautiful.	Sebäbi ol owadan.
I know it could be worse.	Munuň has erbet bolup biljekdigini bilýärin.
It may be possible.	Mümkin bolup biler.
Tell me this.	Muny meniň bilen aýdyň.
Good or bad.	Gowy ýa-da erbet.
Too many, maybe.	Gaty köp, mümkin.
He didn't care.	Oňa alada etmedi.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
We need to help him.	Biz oňa kömek etmeli.
I hope he knows what he's doing.	Näme edýändigini bilýär diýip umyt edýärin.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
Which one.	Haýsy.
Of course, this is not good news.	Elbetde, bu gowy habar däl.
She was amazed.	Ol muňa haýran galdy.
I don't do that	Men muny etmeýärin
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
A few days.	Birnäçe gün.
This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
One does not think it is possible, but it is.	Biri mümkin diýip pikir etmeýär, ýöne şeýle boldy.
This is really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly.
This bar is beautiful, isn't it?	Bu bar owadan, şeýlemi?
That makes me happy.	Bu bolsa meni bagtly edýär.
He would be happy for the first time.	Ilkinji gezek bagtly bolardy.
In fact, he was not a bad person.	Aslynda ol erbet adam däldi.
It's good to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy zat.
I did.	Men etdim.
This will be the last.	Bu iň soňky bolar.
Of course he had to.	Elbetde etmeli boldy.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Munuň üçin hiç zat ýokdy.

He did it.	Muny etdi.
It should be this year.	Bu ýyl bolmaly.
In fact, he asked me three times.	Aslynda, ol menden üç gezek sorady.
I paid attention.	Men üns berdim.
This is just an offer.	Bu diňe teklip.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
It took a while.	Biraz wagt gerek boldy.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
You are the best	Sen iň gowy.
Okay, man.	Bolýar, adam.
I am that girl.	Ol gyz men.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.

Nothing new now.	Indi hiç zat täze däl.
He could not get it.	Ol muny alyp bilmedi.
Three people.	Üç adam.
That's what he told me.	Ine, ol maňa aýtdy.
There is no such thing at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda beýle zat ýok.
I was alone.	Men ýeke boldum.
The problem is a lie.	Mesele ýalan.
Too many, even.	Gaty köp, hatda.
We are together	Biz bilelikde.

Only two.	Diňe iki.
This time it's faster.	Bu gezek has çalt.

There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
There were two other people here.	Bu ýerde başga iki adam bardy.
This is really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly.
Money is nothing.	Pul hiç zat däl.
I got it	Men muny aldym
It's not me anymore.	Bu indi men däl.
He said it should be stopped.	Ol muny bes etmeli diýdi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şonuň üçin aýtmaly.
I was worried about you.	Men sen hakda alada etdim.
Oh, I can't do much for that.	Aý, munuň üçin kän zat edip bilemok.
I am here.	Men şu ýerde.
Of course it can.	Elbetde bolup biler.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
No one is going to do that for you.	Hiç kim seniň üçin muny etjek däl.
I'm not against it.	Men muny etmäge garşy däl.
I think there were a lot of people.	Meniň pikirimçe, köp adam bardy.
We don't need that.	Bize beýle zat gerek däl.
And we can give life.	We durmuş berip bileris.
Man, that's great.	Adam, gaty gowy.
Of course, this is not an easy task.	Elbetde, bu aňsat iş däl.
It makes things really easy.	Bu zatlary hakykatdanam aňsat edýär.
Of course, there was nothing there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.
Take care, he decided.	Alada et, ol karar berdi.
It doesn't help us much.	Bu bize kän bir kömek etmeýär.
That's right.	Şeýle.
I don't need that.	Maňa beýle gerek bolmaz.
This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
I can be there for you.	Men siziň üçin şol ýerde bolup bilerin.
There is no one who can help you.	Size kömek edip biljek adam ýok.
Not only that, of course.	Diňe elbetde däldi.
I have no problem.	Mende hiç hili mesele ýok.
Someone did, of course.	Kimdir biri etdi, elbetde.
Which will be.	Haýsy bolar.
He will too.	Ol hem eder.
She was worried.	Ol alada galdy.
In fact, it is his job.	Aslynda bu onuň işi.
He never answered.	Ol asla jogap bermedi.
You never have to say much.	Hiç haçan köp zat aýtmaly däl.
I have a lot to do.	Meniň etmeli köp zadym bar.
he thought.	diýip pikir etdi.
More opportunities for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin has köp mümkinçilik.
I'm very good at it.	Men muňa gaty gowy.
He will come home tomorrow evening.	Ertir agşam öýüne geler.
And then.	Soň bolsa.
Good.	Gowy.
He does well for himself.	Ol özi üçin gowy edýär.
It will take longer.	Oňa has köp wagt gerek bolar.
This is something bigger than me.	Bu menden uly bir zat.
Of course, this will not be easy.	Elbetde, bu aňsat bolmaz.
He didn't have much to do.	Onuň has köp isleýän zady ýokdy.
We are good together.	Biz bilelikde gowy.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, şeýle etdi.
This is a great job.	Bu gaty gowy iş.
In fact, there is no such thing.	Aslynda beýle zat ýok.
This is really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty erbet.
It was here for the first time.	Bu ýerde ilkinji gezek boldy.
A long time ago.	Köp wagt öň.
Everything is money.	Bar zady pul.
Of course, he was not there for the money.	Elbetde, ol pul üçin ýokdy.
There is a lot of help for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin köp kömek bar.
The problem is still there.	Mesele henizem bar.
There may be an opportunity tomorrow, but then again it is not possible.	Ertir bir mümkinçilik bolup biler, ýöne soň ýene mümkin däl.
We need to help you to help you.	Size kömek etmek üçin bize kömek etmeli.
It will be easier to do this twice.	Muny iki gezek etmek has aňsat bolar.
He has been there for a year.	Ol bir ýyl bäri şol ýerde.
He could not get it.	Ol alyp bilmedi.
Because that's the whole point.	Sebäbi bu hakykatdanam bütin mesele.
Of course, this was not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däldi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde ýalňyşlyk ýok.
He said why not.	Näme üçin beýle däldigini aýtdy.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
Just a book.	Diňe kitap.
Why not go now? 	Näme üçin indi gitmeli däl?
It's too short.	Ol gaty gysga.
.	.
It will be too.	Bu hem bolar.
One should not go.	Biri gitmeli däl.
Maybe next summer?	Belki indiki tomus?
So that seems to be the case.	Şonuň üçin bu mesele ýaly bolup görünýär.
It's very close here.	Bu ýerde gaty ýakyn.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I have a lot.	Mende köp zat bar.
More	Has köp.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu ýerde gyzykly bolýar.
Now everywhere.	Indi hemme ýerde.
I thought he was a really good guy.	Men hakykatdanam gaty gowy ýigit diýip pikir etdim.
Not just himself.	Diňe özi däl.
He did not say anything about them.	Ol olar hakda hiç zat aýtmady.
I knew.	Men bilýärdim.
He can't do that.	Ol muny edip bilmeýär.
Time is hard for us right now.	Häzirki wagtda biziň üçin wagt kyn.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Diňe şeýle bolýar.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, etdi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He never paid much attention to me.	Ol maňa hiç wagt kän üns bermedi.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
And then to me.	Soň bolsa maňa.
Maybe more.	Belki has köp.
He doesn't know what to do.	Ol näme edýändigini bilenok.
It was great to be able to do that.	Muny edip bilmek gaty gowy boldy.
He did not allow it.	Ol oňa rugsat bermedi.
This time another time.	Bu gezek başga gezek.
He could not say anything.	Ol hiç zat aýdyp bilmedi.
Happy for him.	Onuň üçin bagtly.
I still know.	Men henizem bilýärin.
It will come next week.	Geljek hepde geler.
Everything looked beautiful.	Hemme zat owadan ýalydy.
So that's just me.	Şonuň üçin bu diňe men.
He was a little crazy.	Birneme däli boldy.
I think it might be interesting.	Gyzykly bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
Not ‘we’ or ‘they’.	'Biz' ýa-da 'olar' däl.
Like last week.	Geçen hepde ýaly.
This is not new to me.	Bu meniň üçin täze däl.
It's coming.	Gelýär.
There were not many requests for it.	Oňa hiç hili haýyş kän däldi.
The answer seems to be a lot.	Jogap, köp zat ýaly.
I can't sleep	Men uklap bilemok
Now something else.	Indi başga bir zat.
I trust you	Men saňa ynanýaryn.
Not fast.	Çalt däl.
He just said he didn't want to.	Ol diňe islemeýändigini aýtdy.
This guy is good.	Bu ýigit gowy.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
It's been a while.	Birneme wagt boldy.
And then it could be very good.	Soň bolsa gaty gowy bolup biler.
What is a man	Adam näme?
Nothing for me right now.	Häzir meniň üçin hiç zat ýok.
He called me.	Ol maňa jaň etdi.
There was no way to get it.	Ony almak üçin hiç hili mümkinçilik ýokdy.
I'm good for you	Men seniň üçin gowy boldum.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
Too many now.	Häzir gaty köp.
That's right.	Dogry.
It will also be the last.	Şeýle hem iň soňky bolar.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
I think that's great.	Bu gaty gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
He is right here.	Ol edil şu ýerde.
I didn't have enough today.	Mende şu gün ýeterlik zat ýokdy.
It seemed like the right decision at the time.	Şol wagt dogry karar ýalydy.
I don't know about that.	Men bu hakda bilemok.
This is great	Bu gaty gowy
He would be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolardy.
Another time, he thought elsewhere.	Başga bir gezek, başga bir ýerde pikir etdi.
I am happy for you.	Men siziň üçin begenýärin.
We can't do that anymore.	Indi edip bilmeris.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
He was not happy.	Ol bagtly däldi.
It's over.	Soň boldy.
I don't know how to do that.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilenok.
I don't know what happened now.	Indi näme bolandygyny bilemok.
What happens next is what happens.	Soň näme bolsa, näme bolýar.
This can be fun.	Bu gyzykly bolup biler.
Of course, he did so immediately.	Elbetde, ol derrew şeýle etdi.
This is an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş.
So this is a very difficult decision.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty kyn karar.
We are.	Biz.
It took a few months.	Birnäçe aý aldy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He had a lot to do.	Onuň etmeli köp zady bardy.
There is something really wonderful about it.	Bu ýerde hakykatdanam ajaýyp bir zat bar.
Not there.	Ol ýerde ýok.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
They are never enough.	Olar hiç haçan ýeterlik däl.
It does for a lot of guys.	Bu köp ýigit üçin edýär.
I had never thought of that before.	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim.
They are not crazy.	Olar däli däl.
I did it myself.	Men muny özüm etdim.
It's really beautiful.	Hakykatdanam gaty owadan.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
I think this is very true and good advice.	Bu gaty dogry we gowy maslahat diýip pikir edýärin.
It was not today.	Bu gün däldi.
Whatever it is and whatever it is.	Bu näme bolsa we näme bolsa.
Because he knew.	Sebäbi ol bilýärdi.
Then you can tell me.	Soň maňa aýdyp bilersiňiz.
I want something else	Başga bir zat isleýärin
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
I want to go with you again.	Men ýene seniň bilen gitmek isleýärin.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
That man helped me.	Ol adam maňa kömek etdi.
They still exist.	Olar henizem bar.
I thought about it a lot.	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim.
It really is.	Hakykatdanam şeýle.
I will.	Ederin.
To us.	Bize.
This can take several hours.	Bu birnäçe sagat alyp biler.
The police did not inform us.	Polisiýa bize habar bermedi.
He is no more.	Indi ol ýok.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
What is this	Bu näme.
It was hard.	Bu kyn boldy.
He tells you.	Ol saňa aýdýar.
I only got one.	Men diňe birini aldym.
I want to see you there.	Seni ol ýerde görmek isleýärin.
What is this, nothing else.	Bu näme, başga hiç zat däl.
He can do nothing for us.	Ol bize hiç zat edip bilmeýär.
He did not.	Ol bermedi.
I didn't really think about it.	Men hakykatdanam bu hakda pikir etmedim.
Maybe it already exists.	Belki, eýýäm bar.
I hardly believe it here.	Bu ýerde diýen ýaly ynanamok.
Not many answers.	Jogap kän däl.
It really came.	Hakykatdanam geldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine gyzykly zat.
I never saw it.	Hiç haçan görmedim.
I think they are great.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar gaty gowy.
You don't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däl.
So you can	Şonuň üçin edip bilersiňiz
This could be done in two ways.	Muny iki ýol bilen edip bolardy.
Oh well.	Aý, gowy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there. "	Bu ajaýyp "diýdi.
I think so, but a few things can be said.	Meniň pikirimçe, ýöne birnäçe zady aýdyp bolar.
This is just a day.	Bu diňe bir gün.
This is not the case either.	Bu hem däl.
It's been a long night.	Gije köp boldy.
The New Moon is clearly visible tonight.	Täze Aý şu gije aýdyň görünýär.
You can really see everything.	Siz hakykatdanam hemme zady görüp bilersiňiz.
He can.	Ol biler.
So this is a difficult issue.	Şonuň üçin bu kyn mesele.
Easy for him.	Onuň üçin aňsat.
An hour must have passed.	Bir sagat geçen bolmaly.
I didn't know anything else.	Men başga zatlary bilmeýärdim.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
I may still have it.	Mende henizem bar bolmagy mümkin.
Now, he thought.	Häzir, pikir etdi.
Of course, this is not me.	Elbetde, bu men däl.
I did not know	Bilmedim.
I'm sorry, but he said.	Bagyşlaň, ýöne aýtdy.
I can't help it	Men muňa kömek edip bilemok
I'm not kidding about that.	Men beýle zat hakda kyn däl.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He doesn't seem to be able to see me.	Ol meni görüp bilýän ýaly däl.
He did too.	Ol hem etdi.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
Many people do.	Köp adam şeýle edýär.
Maybe even a few hours.	Mümkin, hatda birnäçe sagat.
Maybe there is such a thing.	Belki, şeýle bir zat bar.
It even seemed stupid to him.	Bu hatda oňa samsyk ýalydy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
I think it was very strange.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty geň galdy.
She is great with him.	Ol onuň bilen ajaýyp.
I didn't have to go.	Men gitmeli däldim.
There are several reasons for this.	Ine, munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
Oh, one more thing.	Aý, ýene bir zat.
Calls you	Size jaň edýär.
It's me again.	Bu ýene men.
This is not new.	Bu täze däl.
It's good to be here with him.	Onuň bilen şu ýerde bolmak gowy zat.
Of course, he had nothing to say or do.	Elbetde, onuň aýdyp biljek ýa-da edip biljek zady ýokdy.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He doesn't really like me. "	Ol meni hakykatdanam halamaýar "-diýdi.
It was not a good thing.	Gowy zatlar däldi.
They are not.	Olar ýok.
He can't go to you.	Ol size baryp bilmez.
You don't have to do that anymore.	Indi muny etmeli däl.
That's right- this is about me.	Dogry, men hakda ýeterlik.
I always think of him as someone else.	Men ony hemişe başga bir adam diýip pikir edýärin.
We are good at it.	Biz muňa gowy.
I think it's good.	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
I didn't think it was a good idea.	Gowy pikir diýip pikir etmedim.
Tell him.	Oňa aýdyň.
He told her he wanted everything.	Ol özüne hemme zady isleýändigini aýtdy.
It seemed good.	Gowy ýalydy.
It's not easy.	Muny etmek aňsat däl.
I don't know why.	Näme üçin bilemok.
He couldn't think of these things.	Ol bu zatlar hakda pikir edip bilmedi.
This is not true.	Hakykatdanam bu dogry däldi.
When did it happen	Haçan boldy?
It was an easy day.	Bu aňsat gün boldy.
It's better there.	Ol ýerde has gowy.
He may have done this before.	Ol muny öňem eden bolmagy mümkin.
That's right.	Edil şeýle.
One is not very good.	Biri gaty gowy däl.
Okay, close enough to it.	Bolýar, oňa ýeterlik ýakyn.
Probably not.	Mümkin, hökman däl.
I have a few suggestions.	Mende birnäçe teklip bar.
Where is this	Bu "nirede"
This is a very good question.	Bu gaty gowy sorag.
He allowed her to leave.	Ol gitmäge rugsat berdi.
Of course, you are not very good.	Elbetde, sen gaty gowy däl.
You must have seen it!	Muny gören bolmaly!
He knew a lot about himself.	Ol özi hakda köp zat bilýärdi.
Good things and bad things.	Gowy zatlar we erbet zatlar.
He is alone.	Ol ýeke.
I have a few quick questions.	Mende birnäçe çalt sorag bar.
He told me he did.	Ol maňa şeýle edendigini aýtdy.
That would be nice.	Bu, belki, gowy bolardy.
The right person, the right time.	Dogry adam, dogry wagt.
She is beautiful, beautiful, but she will not be.	Ol owadan, owadan, ýöne beýle bolmaz.
This is a new path.	Bu täze ýol.
He is as big as you.	Ol siziň ýaly uly.
That sounds like a bad idea.	Bu erbet pikir ýaly.
I thought about you.	Men sen hakda pikir etdim.
And then he did something good.	Soň bolsa gowy zat etdi.
He is a bad man.	Ol erbet adam.
Not about me.	Men hakda däl.
This is a very bad thing.	Bu gaty erbet zat.
It's not really easy to say that.	Muny aýtmak hakykatdanam aňsat däl.

Ma'am.	Bu.
It gave me a great idea.	Maňa gaty gowy pikir berdi.

I decided.	Men karar berdim.
That would be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolardy.
Not so bad now.	Indi beýle erbet däl.
How are you	Nähili?
This was his first.	Bu onuň ilkinji boldy.
It's back.	Bu gaýdyp geldi.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
It’s been such a week for me.	Bu meniň üçin şeýle hepde boldy.
This is a very difficult thing to do.	Bu etmek gaty kyn zat.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He ignored it.	Ol muňa üns bermedi.
Something for tomorrow.	Ertir üçin bir zat.
I'm afraid to do something.	Men bir zatlar etmekden gorkýaryn.
I was not happy.	Men bagtly däldim.
It was not difficult.	Bu gaty kyn däldi.

This is really hard for us.	Bu hakykatdanam biziň üçin kyn.
For the future.	Geljek üçin.
I went there.	Men ol ýere baryp gördüm.
Maybe a lot, or not so much.	Belki köp zat, ýa-da beýle kän däl.
It was hard to talk to him.	Onuň bilen gürleşmek kyn boldy.
Nothing will happen to you.	Saňa hiç zat bolmaz.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
He is closer now.	Ol indi has ýakyn.
He had to do it.	Ol etmeli boldy.
He asked.	Diýip sorady.
About it.	Bu barada.
I thought it was good.	Gowy diýip pikir etdim.
You have to worry.	Alada etmeli.
The time seemed short.	Wagty gysga ýalydy.
You will need money for something.	Bir zat üçin size pul gerek bolar.
Okay.	Bolýar.
He knows that too.	Muny hem bilýär.
He did not want to do that.	Ol muny etmek islemedi.
I don't want to talk about it.	Bu hakda gürleşmek islämok.
This is probably the hardest thing.	Bu iň kyn zat bolsa gerek.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
I don't want to be that person anymore.	Indi ol adam bolmak islämok.
We are not.	Biz beýle däl.
Okay, good for him.	Bolýar, onuň üçin gowy.
This should not be enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl bolmaly.
I'm not happy.	Men bagtly däl.
Someone else does.	Başga biri edýär.
Really beautiful.	Hakykatdanam owadan.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
He wanted to know what he wanted to know.	Ol bilmek isleýän zadyny bilmek isledi.
He thought I did.	Men pikir etdim diýip pikir etdi.
It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
He asked me a few questions about myself.	Ol maňa özüm hakda birnäçe sorag berdi.
Do more now.	Indi has köp iş et.
I don't know what he did to you.	Onuň saňa näme edenini bilemok.
It can be a word or a lot.	Bir söz ýa-da köp bolup biler.
I don't know anything about that.	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilemok.
I do not mind doing this again.	Men muny ýene bir gezek etmäge garşy däl.
Maybe a long time.	Belki köp wagt.
Now there was no problem.	Indi hiç hili kynçylyk ýokdy.
I tried a little.	Biraz synap gördüm.
She looks so young and looks so beautiful.	Ol gaty ýaş görünýär we gaty owadan görünýär.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
What do you need.	Näme gerek.
Then he went home.	Soň bolsa öýüne gitdi.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň, bagyşlaň
You have to worry.	Alada etmeli.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
You are very new	Siz gaty täze
At the time, I didn't know that.	Şol wagt men muny bilmeýärdim.
Money, of course.	Elbetde, pul.

Of course, this will not be wonderful.	Elbetde, bu ajaýyp bolmaz.
There.	Ol ýerde.
I still have that problem.	Mende henizem şol mesele bar.
He understood correctly.	Dogry düşündi.
No problem.	Hiç hili mesele ýok.
This question is very difficult for me.	Bu sorag meniň üçin gaty kyn.
That probably says something good about us.	Bu, belki, biz hakda gowy zat aýdýar.
Anyone can do that.	Her kim muny edip biler.
I didn't want to think about it.	Bu hakda pikir etmek islemedim.
It took me a long time to tell the truth.	Maňa hakykaty aýtmak üçin köp wagt boldy.
This is a song.	Bu aýdym.
I called once, but no more.	Men bir gezek jaň etdim, indi ýok.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
One wonders why he didn't do the other.	Biri näme üçin başga birini etmedi diýip pikir edýär.
Then he had to let me go.	Soň bolsa meni alyp gitmäge rugsat bermeli boldy.
You are very strange to me.	Sen meniň üçin gaty geň.
A lot of guys do that.	Köp ýigit muny edýär.
I really want that	Men muny hakykatdanam isleýärin
It could be tomorrow.	Ertir bolup biler.
He wanted to be big.	Uly bolmak isledi.
At the same time,	Edil şol wagt,
Not a beautiful person, but not a bad person.	Owadan adam däl, ýöne erbet däl.
This is a short book.	Bu gysga kitap.
It really happened.	Bu hakykatdanam boldy.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle etmeli.
It would be great.	Gaty gowy bolardy.
I never have	Mende hiç wagt ýok
Do it right	Dogry et.
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
It seemed like a great thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat ýalydy.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
It's just hard to do.	Diňe muny etmek kyn.

It's me.	Bu men.
He didn’t, but he knows.	Ol ýokdy, ýöne bilýär.

He made no mistake.	Ol hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedi.
He did a lot for me.	Ol meniň üçin köp zat etdi.
There was life, there was no more.	Durmuş bardy, indi ýokdy.
No one could.	Hiç kim edip bilmedi.
Because he doesn't know.	Sebäbi ol bilmez.
There was nothing else for him here.	Bu ýerde onuň üçin başga zat ýokdy.
This year will be a very interesting one.	Bu ýyl gaty gyzykly ýyl bolar.
I'm sorry last night.	Düýn agşam bagyşlaň.
I haven't tried it.	Men synap görmedim.
The day has come.	Gün geldi.
No one is going to help me.	Hiç kim maňa kömek etjek däl.
I never wanted to.	Men muny asla islemedim.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
He still didn't know everything about her.	Ol entek ol hakda hemme zady bilmeýärdi.
Not for us.	Bize däl.
I couldn't do it before.	Öň doly edip bilmedim.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
That's a good word.	Bu gowy söz.
She now lives alone.	Ol indi ýeke ýaşaýar.
The man replied in a serious voice.	Ol adam çynlakaý ses bilen jogap berdi.
That was the answer.	Bu jogap boldy.
This book will be interesting for school.	Bu kitap mekdebe gyzykly bolar.
Not much, not much.	Gaty, kän däl.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly zat.
You can only see it.	Ony diňe görüp bilersiňiz.
What a day he thought.	Ol nähili gün diýip pikir etdi.
In fact, it is not difficult to do so.	Aslynda beýle etmek kyn däl.
This is him.	Bu onuň özi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Great	Ajaýyp.
Now, the time has come.	Häzir, wagt geldi.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
The two are different.	Ikisi başga.
It takes time to worry.	Alada etmek üçin wagt gerek.
Not us, not me.	Biz däl, men däl.
It was like a message.	Bu habar ýalydy.
To have fun, of course.	Elbetde hezil etmek üçin.
It was very, very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn, kyn boldy.
The idea was great.	Bu pikir gaty gowy boldy.
This is often not the case.	Bu köplenç dogry däl.
You're stupid, you don't have to be here.	Sen samsyk, bu ýerde bolmak hökman däl.
This is very clear.	Bu gaty aýdyň.
Then came a new idea.	Soň bolsa oňa täze bir pikir geldi.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
Whatever you need.	Size näme gerek bolsa.
I had a reason.	Mende bir sebäp bardy.
Nothing else.	Başga ýok.
Something interesting about them	Olar hakda bir gyzykly zat
He didn't seem to mind.	Ol maňa erbet bir zat däl ýalydy.
The problem is here.	Mesele şu ýerde.
I don’t think anyone is really bad.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam erbet däl diýip pikir edýärin.
That could be the case.	Şeýle bolup biler.
Seriously.	Çynlakaý.
I need another way.	Maňa ýene bir ýol gerek.
This seems to be true.	Bu dogry ýaly.
Really everywhere.	Hakykatdanam hemme ýerde.
What he wants.	Isleýän zady.
It's hard to do that.	Muny etmek kyn.
You must be a girl	Sen gyz bolmaly
Something is wrong here.	Bu ýerde bir zat dogry däl.
There is a good reason for this.	Munuň üçin gowy sebäp bar.
That was never the case.	Bu hiç wagt mesele däldi.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu nähili.
Those things were not enough.	Ol zatlar ýeterlik däldi.
Three.	Üç.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň üçin söz.
I can't even do it.	Men hatda edip bilemok.
You can sleep.	Siz uklap bilersiňiz.
Everything has its time.	Her zadyň wagty bar.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
Everything seems to be right.	Hemme zat dogry ýaly.
He began to return home.	Ol öýüne gaýdyp başlady.
He did not give it to her.	Ol oňa bermedi.
It must be a lot of fun.	Köp gyzykly bolmaly.
He took everything from me.	Ol menden hemme zady aldy.
No one else did.	Başga hiç kim muny etmedi.
It was great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy boldy.
You will be here.	Siz şu ýerde bolarsyňyz.
This is the last business day, he said.	Bu, iň soňky iş güni diýdi.
Very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly.
They are already here.	Olar eýýäm şu ýerde.
It's really easy.	Hakykatdanam aňsat.
There are several possibilities.	Birnäçe mümkinçilik bar.
Offering the same thing.	Şol bir zady teklip etmek.
I want it.	Men ony isleýärin.
A few books.	Birnäçe kitap.
There is no correct answer.	Dogry jogap ýok.
Oh right.	Aý, dogry.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
Tonight, he thought it would be the last night.	Şu gije, bu gije iň soňky bolar diýip pikir etdi.
He said he knew.	Bilýändigini aýtdy.
You have to go for it.	Munuň üçin gitmeli.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
It was the worst.	Iň erbet boldy.
I believe it would be very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly bolardy diýip ynanýaryn.
I think there is a reason for that.	Munuň bir sebäbi bar diýip pikir edýärin.
You have to go and rest.	Gidip dynç almaly.
Every year.	Her ýyl.
There has to be a better word.	Has gowy söz bolmaly.
Of course it does.	Elbetde, bu hökman edýär.

You have to do that.	Şeýle etmeli.
Of course it will be good.	Elbetde gowy bolar.
Girl, I care about you.	Gyz, men sen hakda alada edýärin.
Maybe no one was good enough.	Belki, hiç kim ýeterlik däldi.
You are not enough	Siz ýeterlik däl

The answer, of course, is many.	Jogap, elbetde, köp.
Which is it.	Bu haýsy.
No money.	Pul ýok.

It gave me a lot.	Bu maňa köp zat berdi.
We are happy.	Biz bagtly.
Everything was fine for me.	Hemme zat meniň üçin gowy boldy.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
This is not money.	Bu pul däl.
I can't do a single thing.	Men ýekeje işi hem edip bilemok.
He did not think it was possible.	Mümkin diýip pikir etmedi.
There is a reason for this.	Munuň bir sebäbi bar.
He did not say that.	Ol muny aýtmady.
Just to help.	Diňe kömek etmek üçin.
I'm at home.	Men öýde.

I agree with that a lot.	Men muňa köp razy boldum.
The police took him away.	Polisiýa ony alyp gitdi.

This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl ýaly.
It could be worse.	Has erbet bolup biler.
He did not say anything about his work.	Ol öz işi hakda hiç zat aýtmady.
We can't get that.	Muny alyp bilmeris.
I hope we can do it next year.	Geljek ýyl edip bileris diýip umyt edýärin.
Not many people know about it.	Bu barada köp adam bilmeýär.

For him.	Onuň üçin.
Not much.	Kän däldi.
He responded immediately.	Ol derrew jogap berdi.
There was no book.	Kitap ýokdy.

I'll call you in the morning.	Irden saňa jaň ederin.
You have to go with him.	Sen onuň bilen gitmeli.
It will do the same.	Bu hem eder.
It looks good on me.	Maňa gowy görünýär.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
You can do this yourself.	Muny özüňiz edip bilersiňiz.
This is not even possible.	Bu hatda mümkin däl.
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
There was no time for that.	Munuň üçin wagt ýokdy.
This is serious.	Bu çynlakaý.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
It's actually the same song.	Aslynda şol bir aýdym.
This is not true for me.	Bu meniň üçin dogry däl.

This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
I can't say	Men aýdyp biljek däl
I don't know why.	Näme üçin bilemok.
The answer is short and concise.	Jogap gysga we gysga.
I was not so good.	Men beýle gowy däldim.
And we.	We biz.

That fact must be taken into account. "	Hakykatdanam, bu gaty dogry ýaly.
Maybe there are many answers.	Belki köp jogap bar.

I didn't do anything good here.	Men bu ýerde hiç hili gowy iş etmedim.
This is good news.	Bu gowy habar.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Men sizi biynjalyk etmek islemedim.

It must be something like this.	Munuň ýaly bir zat bolmaly.
Good job	Gowy iş.
He is not coming.	Ol gelenok.
Gone a year ago.	Bir ýyl ozal gitdi.
Of course, I didn't do that for money.	Elbetde, muny pul üçin etmedim.
He advised me.	Ol seni maňa maslahat berdi.

That's right- this is not about me.	Bu ýeterlik dogry.
There was no reason.	Sebäbi ýokdy.
I thought it was a stupid decision.	Bu samsyk karar diýip pikir etdim.
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
Besides, this is not the case.	Mundan başga, beýle däl.
You have to be right for that.	Munuň üçin dogry bolmaly.

I know how long it has been around.	Näçe wagt bäri bardygyny bilýärin.
Can anyone suggest something that can help?	Kömek edip biljek bir zady teklip edip biljek barmy?
You know, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Bilýärsiň, beýle bolmaly däl.
He could no longer think of it.	Ol indi bu barada pikir edip bilmedi.

He did a lot.	Ol gaty köp zat etdi.

It's very difficult now.	Häzir gaty kyn zat.
It's too short to say.	Muny aýtmak gaty gysga.
This is a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý mesele.

No one could see it, but no one could see it.	Hiç kim ony görüp bilmedi, ýöne hiç kimi görüp bilmedi.
Maybe he's here.	Belki, ol şu ýerde.
There is a lot you can do to relax there.	Şol ýerde dynç almak üçin köp zat edip bilersiňiz.

So much for that.	Munuň üçin köp zat.

For the police.	Polisiýa üçin.

The problem is money.	Mesele pul.

Now you have to decide.	Indi karar bermeli.
The news made him very anxious.	Bu habar ony gaty biynjalyk etdi.
How and where, and why, and why, and why.	Hemme zat haýsy we nirede we nädip we näme üçin, näme üçin, näme üçin boldy.

Maybe it was good.	Belki, bu gowy boldy.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.

You don't need much.	Kän zat gerek däl.
I really knew that.	Muny hakykatdanam bilýärdim.
It was very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly boldy.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Muny diňe bir gezek etmeli.

I will be a bad person.	Erbet adam bolaryn.

He is good.	Ol gowy.
Three or more.	Üç ýa-da has köp.

It would only be months and years.	Diňe aý we ýyl bolardy.
With two girls.	Iki gyz bilen.
It takes a day to relax and have fun.	Dynç almak we hezil etmek üçin bir gün gerek.
Someone had to do it.	Kimdir biri etmeli boldy.

Now he is gone.	Indi ol gitdi.
There is no answer to that.	Oňa jogap ýok.
It would be faster and better.	Bu has çalt we has gowy bolardy.
This time it could be better.	Bu gezek ol has gowy bolup biler.
It would be somewhere else for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin başga ýerde bolardy.

No one can see me.	Hiç kim meni görüp bilmeýär.
That's it.	Boldy.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
You don't have to tell him anything.	Oňa hiç zat aýtmak hökman däl.
I thought it was really serious.	Men hakykatdanam çynlakaý diýip pikir etdim.
He did everything right.	Ol hemme zady dogry etdi.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
Everyone was there.	Hemmeler ol ýerde bardy.
This is not interesting.	Bu gyzykly däl.
Actually the same thing.	Aslynda şol bir zat.
He didn't want to talk.	Ol gürleşmek islemedi.
Now she is worried.	Indi ol alada edip başlady.
I advised her to go home.	Men oňa öýe gitmegi maslahat berdim.
It's a little weird.	Ol birneme geň.
They can be very interesting.	Olar gaty gyzykly bolup biler.
It comes to him.	Oňa gelýär.
You will not need it.	Size gerek bolmaz.
This is not a big deal.	Bu uly zat däl.
Couldn't sleep tonight.	Bu gije uklap bilmedi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
This is not the case today.	Häzirki wagtda beýle däl.
It was like somewhere else.	Ol başga bir ýerde ýalydy.
Someone did.	Kimdir biri etdi.
I don't want you to worry about things like that.	Munuň ýaly zatlar üçin sizi biynjalyk etmek islämok.
There are good or bad days.	Gowy ýa-da erbet gün bar.
This, of course, was not possible at all.	Bu, elbetde, düýbünden mümkin däldi.
This was not very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal däldi.
Fast and loud.	Çalt we gaty ses.
I was there every night.	Men her gije boldum.
I haven't called him yet.	Men entek oňa jaň etmedim.
I liked it.	Gowy gördüm.
He couldn't do that either.	Şeýle hem edip bilmedi.
I'm still yours.	Men henizem seniň.
Really smart.	Hakykatdanam akylly.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Just one.	Diňe bir.
Maybe next time.	Belki indiki gezek.
These things are just that.	Bu zatlar diňe.
I really know that.	Men muny hakykatdanam bilýärin.
It's about work.	Bu hili iş hakda.
One day everything will be gone.	Bir gün hemme zat ýok bolar.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman däl.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
He will not need it.	Oňa mätäç bolmaz.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
There was no one else there, only us.	Ol ýerde asla başga hiç kim ýokdy, diňe biz.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
It's too long, too long.	Bu uzak, gaty uzak.
I just did it.	Men diňe bir iş etdim.
You know what's in there.	Ol ýerde näme bardygyny bilýärsiň.
No need to rest.	Dynç gerek däl.
I'm scared.	Men gorkýaryn.
Do it yourself.	Muny özüňiz et.
It always seemed to be needed.	Hemişe gerek ýalydy.
I was there.	Men ol ýerde boldum.
I really don't need it.	Maňa hakykatdanam gerek däl.
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty kyn mesele.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
He was always there.	Elmydama bardy.
He didn't think about it.	Ol hiç hili pikir etmedi.
I will only be here for a year.	Men bu ýerde diňe bir ýyl bolaryn.
I will have so much fun.	Şeýle hezil ederin.
He just said what he was thinking.	Ol diňe näme pikir edýändigini aýtdy.
It really bothered him.	Hakykatdanam ony biynjalyk etdi.
I just can't think of it.	Diňe bu hakda pikir etmek bilenok.
He knew he couldn't do it.	Ol muny edip bilmejekdigini bilýärdi.
There are so many problems.	Mesele gaty köp.
This is the worst time.	Bu iň erbet wagt.
This seems very strange.	Bu gaty geň görünýär.
Everything was no longer possible.	Hemme zat indi mümkin däldi.
No harm done.	Zyýan bermeli däl.
He has been thinking about these things for a long time.	Uzak wagt bäri bu zatlar hakda pikir edýär.
No longer needed.	Mundan beýläk zerur däl.
I never want to worry about money.	Hiç wagt pul hakda alada etmek islämok.
I have to.	Mende bolmaly.
This is about you and me now.	Bu indi sen we men hakda.
He must be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolmaly.
He stayed there all day.	Ol ol ýerde bütin gün galdy.
Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
It was good with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy boldy.
I don't like it	Muny halamok
He will do so.	Ol şeýle eder.
This is an interesting book.	Bu gyzykly kitap.
No one answered me.	Hiç kim maňa jogap bermedi.
I can't see anything	Men hiç zady görüp bilemok
A lot of time.	Wagt köp.
He can see so much.	Ol gaty köp zady görüp bilýär.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I bought a new book.	Men täze kitap satyn aldym.
I could not go.	Men gidip bilmedim.
Now he didn't have to worry about anything.	Indi ol hiç zat hakda alada etmeli däldi.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
It will be good, but you have to rest.	Gowy bolar, ýöne dynç almaly.
What a guy.	Nähili ýigit.
I gave myself.	Men özümi berdim.
I agree.	Men razy.
Of course it is.	Elbetde şeýle bolýar.
There is no one else like you.	Seniň ýaly başga hiç kim ýok.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
Great for summer.	Tomus üçin ajaýyp.
I am here.	Men şu ýerde.
He realized that it could be serious.	Çynlakaý bolup biljekdigine düşündi.
There should be more.	Ol ýerde has köp bolmaly.
I gave.	Men berdim.
The sun.	Gün.
This is not enough.	Bu gaty ýeterlik däl.
What does he do?	Ol näme edýär?
I did a great job.	Men gaty gowy iş etdim.
He is not that stupid !!.	Ol beýle samsyk däl !!.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
Life is good.	Durmuş gowy.
I'm new here.	Men bu ýerde täze.
He was often absent.	Ol köplenç ýokdy.
You don't need both.	Size ikimizem gerek däl.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
The right question.	Dogry sorag.
He still has to be here.	Ol henizem şu ýerde bolmaly.
Someone was there.	Ol ýerde kimdir biri bardy.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
He came alone.	Ol ýeke geldi.
There were beautiful things.	Owadan zatlar bardy.
It was possible.	Bu mümkin boldy.
We can help you.	Biz size kömek edip bileris.
Something happened to him.	Oňa bir zat boldy.
It makes me crazy.	Bu meni däli edýär.
He did not do it once.	Bir gezek etmedi.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I hope it never happens again.	Hiç haçan beýle bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
He knows this is not good for him.	Munuň özi üçin gowy däldigini bilýär.
To do	Etmek.
And now.	Indi bolsa.
I know, I never wanted that.	Bilýän, men muny hiç haçan islemedim.
I can't tell you much.	Men saňa kän zat aýdyp biljek däl.
I'll do whatever I need.	Näme gerek bolsa ederin.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
Someone will come.	Kimdir biri geler.
I still do most of the time.	Men henizem köplenç edýärin.
Because it was clear.	Sebäbi aýdyň boldy.
This is my first time here.	Men bu ýerde ilkinji gezek.
There may be several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bolup biler.
I never saw him again.	Men ony ýene görmedim.
Really much.	Hakykatdanam köp.
He lives there.	Ol ýerde şol ýerde ýaşaýar.
It started.	Ol başlady.
No one should.	Hiç kim etmeli däl.
It seemed interesting.	Gyzykly ýalydy.
Someone who knows how to do these things.	Bu zatlary nädip etmelidigini bilýän adam.
Two words to you	Size iki söz
He gave it to me.	Ol muny maňa berdi.
Nothing happened.	Hiç zat ýokdy.
It was not in the right place.	Dogry ýerde däldi.
He said no one needed to worry.	Hiç kime alada gerek däl diýdi.
I almost know that.	Muny bilýän ýaly diýen ýaly.
We are very young.	Biz gaty ýaş.
There is damage.	Zyýan bar.
Of course, I should never have done that.	Elbetde, muny hiç haçan etmeli däldim.
This is not very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly däl.
Maybe it will.	Belki bolar.
Now that's the question.	Indi bu sorag.
He must have wanted it too much.	Ony gaty köp isleýän bolmaly.
It makes me crazy.	Bu meni däli edýär.
Of course no one is going to do that.	Elbetde muny hiç kim etjek däl.
I knew he was going to do it.	Men muny etjekdigini bilýärdim.
We have to do something and fast!	Biz bir zat etmeli we çalt!
Tell him.	Oňa aýdyň.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
Must be immediately.	Derrew bolmaly.
Must be everywhere.	Hemme ýerde bolmaly.
He knows nothing now.	Ol indi hiç zady bilenok.
I hope you're not alone tonight.	Şu agşam özüňiz däl diýip umyt edýärin.
Many years ago.	Köp ýyl mundan ozal.
He really is.	Ol hakykatdanam.
I was not there	Men ol ýerde däldim
Only a fool will even think about talking to them.	Diňe samsyk hatda olar bilen gürleşmek hakda pikir eder.
I hope someone can help me.	Kimdir biri maňa kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
I can't go now.	Men häzir gidip bilemok.
He was good.	Ol gowy boldy.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
To be happy	Bagtly bolmak.
Because something was serious.	Sebäbi bir zadyň çynlakaý bir zady bardy.
The time was short.	Wagt gysga boldy.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
He stopped calling.	Ol jaň etmegini bes etdi.
That's fine with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
I'll be fine	Men gowy bolaryn
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
I was almost happy for him.	Men onuň üçin bagtly diýen ýaly boldum.
Ma'am.	Bu.
It was a really great night.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp gije boldy.
That alone was not enough.	Diňe ýeterlik däldi.
Not much.	Kän däl.
I think this is the future.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu geljek.
I hope it will be really good.	Men hakykatdanam gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
I am happy today.	Men şu gün bagtly.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
I did not.	Men etmedim.
It seems to be there.	Aslynda ol ýerde bar ýaly.
Immediately the police called.	Derrew polisiýa jaň etdi.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Two years ago.	Iki ýyl mundan ozal.
Not that month.	Şol aý däl.
It was hard for me.	Bu meniň üçin kyn boldy.
Something about that.	Bu hakda bir zat.
I think that’s what it’s all about.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu näme hakda.
There was no one.	Hiç kim ýokdy.
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu dogry däl.
They are very good.	Olar gaty gowy.
That day	Şol gün.
I saw.	Men gördüm.
He should be at home most of the time.	Ol köplenç öýde bolmaly.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
That's enough for me.	Bu meniň üçin ýeterlik.
So it will not be. 	Şonuň üçin beýle bolmaz. 
Now someone can go.	Indi kimdir biri baryp biler.
He is always there.	Ol hemişe şol ýerde.
Very interesting things to see.	Görmek üçin gaty gyzykly zatlar.
I think that could be the reason.	Munuň sebäbi bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
It was a good day.	Bu gowy gün boldy.
I think you can do that.	Muny edip bilersiňiz diýip pikir edýärin.
They are not difficult for you.	Olar siziň üçin kyn däl.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
Maybe you should go.	Belki gitmeli.
Not good, but very good.	Gowy däl, ýöne gaty gowy.
There is a lot here.	Bu ýerde köp zat.
It would be great to see that.	Muny görmek gaty gowy bolardy.
I have never done such a big thing before.	Men ozal beýle uly zady etmedim.
Couldn't be.	Bolup bilmedi.
He knew.	Ol bilýärdi.
They are very large.	Olar gaty uly.
Not difficult, but very necessary.	Kyn däl, ýöne gaty zerur.
It's faster and easier.	Bu has çalt we aňsat.
You are everywhere.	Sen hemme ýerde.
It will take some time.	Birneme wagt gerek bolar.
There was no other option.	Başga mümkinçilik ýokdy.
I doubt anything good will happen.	Gowy bir zat boljakdygyna şübhelenýärin.
This girl wants everything.	Bu gyz hemme zady isleýär.
Because he did.	Sebäbi şeýle etdi.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
Tell me.	Aýdyň.
Maybe he did it once.	Belki, bir gezek şeýle eden bolsa gerek.
There was something else about him.	Ol hakda başga zat bardy.
Now tell me.	Indi maňa aýdyň.
That's all we need.	Ol bize gerek zat.
Not too big.	Gaty uly däl.
It should be fun.	Bu hezil bolmaly.
We can do this for you.	Muny siziň üçin erbet edip bileris.
It takes two things.	Munuň üçin iki zat gerek.
Really	Hakykatdanam.
Not like a girl.	Gyz ýaly däl.
Good job.	Iş gowy.
Adult.	Uly adam.
I have to go tonight.	Şu gije gitmeli.
One is new.	Biri täze.
The first day is fast but not enough.	Çalt, ýöne ýeterlik däl ilkinji güni.
I think everything is possible.	Hemme zat mümkin diýip pikir edýärin.
Everyone wants to know about it.	Her kim bu hakda bilmek isleýär.
He objected, but no one paid attention.	Ol garşy çykdy, ýöne hiç kim üns bermedi.
A long way to go last year.	Geçen ýyl gaty uzak ýol.
The problem.	Mesele.
There is someone there who wants to talk to you.	Ol ýerde siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýän biri bar.
And so it was.	Ol hem şeýle boldy.
A week later.	Bir hepde soň.
I know he knows.	Bilýändigini bilýärin.
There was no time for that.	Munuň üçin wagt ýokdy.
I didn't mean to offend him.	Men oňa aýtmak islemedim.
He always does that.	Elmydama şeýle edýär.
Good.	Gowy.
I know enough.	Men muny ýeterlik bilýärin.
Now this is a difficult issue.	Indi bu kyn mesele.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu şeýle gyzykly pikir.
I got one here	Bu ýerde birini aldym
I only saw it yesterday.	Men ony diňe düýn gördüm.
It takes several years.	Munuň üçin birnäçe ýyl gerek.
Because that's what happened to you, you know better.	Sebäbi saňa şeýle boldy, has gowy bilýärsiň.
There was no way to do that.	Muny etmäge hiç hili ýol ýokdy.
We can do something about it.	Bu hakda bir zat edip bileris.
This is not interesting.	Bu gyzykly däl.
I never did that, but what.	Men muny hiç haçan etmedim, ýöne näme.
Of course not.	Elbetde, sen däl.
He could not go.	Ol gidip bilmedi.
There is the police.	Polisiýa bar.
I had no such thing.	Mende beýle zat ýokdy.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
What do you think we can do?	Siziň pikiriňizçe näme edip bileris?
Seems to want more.	Has köp zat isleýän ýaly.
You have to be right.	Dogry bolmaly.
I did it again.	Men ýene etdim.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
You know about it.	Bu barada bilýärsiň.
Really the same idea.	Hakykatdanam şol bir pikir.
For the next two weeks.	Indiki iki hepde üçin.
You really can.	Siz hakykatdanam edip bilersiňiz.
That's great.	Bu ajaýyp zat.
Besides, this time it was not.	Mundan başga, bu gezek beýle däldi.
Because you	Sebäbi sen.
Many were surprised.	Köp adam geň galdy.
Do it, or someone else.	Muny, ýa-da başga birini et.
I can't be mad.	Maňa däli bolup bilemok.
This can be easy.	Bu aňsat bolup biler.
So many.	Şeýle köp.
There is nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýok.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
In fact, it is very easy.	Aslynda bu gaty aňsat.
Many people.	Köp adam.
That's weird, isn't it?	Bu gaty geň, şeýlemi?
I never thought about it.	Men bu barada hiç hili pikir etmedim.
He must have seen it.	Ony gören bolmaly.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It's too early in the morning.	Irden gaty ir.
I could not see anyone	Hiç kimi görüp bilmedim
Here we can do something new every day.	Bu ýerde her gün täze bir zat edip bileris.
An interesting question remains.	Gyzykly sorag galdy.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
Because he could.	Sebäbi edip bilýärdi.
I think that's right.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry.
Needless to say.	Muny aýtmak gerek bolsa gerek.
I know it exists.	Men onuň bardygyny bilýärin.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldim.
It was very close.	Gaty ýakyn boldy.
We have to promise to go with us.	Biz bilen gitmäge söz bermeli.
I'm not coming back	Men gaýdyp gelenok
This is different.	Bu başga.
He knows he doesn't care.	Alada etmeýändigini bilýär.
It could be.	Bu bolup biler.
He is the same.	Ol edil şol bir.
He knows exactly what he is doing.	Näme edýändigini doly bilýär.
At the time, I thought it was a good idea.	Şol wagt gowy pikir diýip pikir etdim.
he said.	özi aýtdy.
I want to think about who did it.	Kimiň muny edendigini pikir etmek isleýärin.
You didn't have to think about it.	Bu hakda pikir etmeli däldi.
That's exactly what happens.	Edil şeýle bolýar.
You can help me here.	Bu ýerde maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz.
I'm busy this morning.	Men şu gün irden meşgul.
The man came again that night.	Adam şol gije ýene geldi.
Not so easy before.	Öň gaty aňsat däl.
And you are here.	Sen bolsa şu ýerde.
He was still there.	Ol henizem bardy.
Of course, I can see that.	Elbetde, men muny görüp bilerin.
She is not happy.	Ol bagtly däl.
I have never seen anything like it.	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim.
It's there.	Ol ýerde bar.
That can't be true!	Bu dogry bolup bilmez!
Not just yet.	Diňe entek däl.
I didn't have to tell him.	Men oňa aýtmaly däldim.
Nothing will be the same as before.	Hiç zat öňküsi ýaly bolmaz.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Diňe, bu zerur zat.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Gowy, aýdyň zatlar.
This is no longer true.	Bu indi dogry däl.
Good.	Gowy.
I got it.	Men aldym.
Only one thought.	Diňe biri pikir berdi.
You have to do more for that.	Munuň üçin has köp zat etmeli.
She was worried.	Ol alada galdy.
He could not and should not.	Edip bilmedi we etmeli däldi.
I saw it myself.	Men muny özüm gördüm.
This will not be possible.	Bu mümkin bolmaz.
For a while	Biraz wagt.
He was no longer young.	Ol indi ýaş däldi.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
This was the first for me.	Bu meniň üçin ilkinji boldy.
A lot of people are there.	Köp adam ol ýerde.
This is the reality of life.	Bu durmuş hakykaty.
He can	Edip biler
This is a difficult decision.	Bu kyn karar.
A person or something.	Adam ýa-da bir zat.
It's almost as good as seeing it.	Ony görmek ýaly ajaýyp diýen ýaly.
That will not happen again.	Indi beýle zat bolmaz.
Not a man.	Bir adam däl.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
He called again.	Ol ýene jaň etdi.
Talk a little bit.	Biraz gürleşmek.
He was not ready.	Ol taýyn däldi.
He agreed with me.	Ol meniň bilen razy boldy.
Not really my thing.	Aslynda meniň zadym däl.
He was not a happy man.	Ol bagtly adam däldi.
I think that's me.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu men.
He was still there.	Ol henizem bardy.
He does too.	Ol hem edýär.
This can be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolup biler.
I can decide for myself here.	Bu ýerde özüm üçin karar berip bilerin.
I really have to give it another go.	Men hakykatdanam ýene bir gezek bermeli.
He did not ask any questions.	Ol hiç hili sorag bermedi.
There was something else.	Bu başga bir zat bardy.
So the short answer is, you don't have to do anything.	Şonuň üçin gysga jogap, hiç zat etmeli däl.
For the first time, he understood.	Ilkinji gezek düşündi.
It's very easy for them.	Bu olar üçin gaty aňsat.
This is nothing.	Bu hiç zat däl.
You don't have to ask a question.	Sorag bermeli däl.
He knows how to have fun.	Nädip hezil etmelidigini bilýär.
I think this idea should be clear.	Bu pikir aýdyň bolmaly diýip pikir edýärin.
He thought about leaving and getting help.	Gitmek we kömek almak hakda pikir etdi.
Not too much.	Gaty köp däl.
She's crazy about a girl.	Ol gyz hakda däli.
Worry now	Indi alada et.
So can you.	Siz hem şeýle bolup bilersiňiz.
To worry about	Alada etmek.
Too big of course.	Elbetde gaty uly.
This is a great, wonderful question.	Bu ajaýyp, ajaýyp sorag.
"There must be a lot of people there," he said.	Ol: "Ol ýerde gaty köp adam bar bolsa gerek" -diýdi.
That first week was really hard.	Şol ilkinji hepde hakykatdanam kyn boldy.
The food was great.	Nahar gaty gowy boldy.
Maybe he knows something about it.	Belki, bu hakda bir zat bilýän bolsa gerek.
He did not know if he could do it or not.	Edip biljekdigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilmedi.
It can be several years and many hours.	Birnäçe ýyl we köp sagat bolup biler.
Almost there.	Ol ýerde diýen ýaly.
How strange.	Nähili geň.
He didn't want to worry about them.	Ol olar hakda alada etjek däldi.
He was crazy.	Ol däli boldy.
It didn't seem to be happening anymore.	Indi beýle bolmaz ýalydy.
There are two ways to do this.	Bu barada iki ýol ýok.
He did everything.	Ol hemme zady etdi.
You know that.	Muny bilýärsiň.
Not many, but several.	Köp däl, ýöne birnäçe.
There is nothing for us there.	Ol ýerde biziň üçin hiç zat ýok.
We need an answer.	Bize jogap gerek.
The reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi.
Sorry, but.	Bagyşlaň, ýöne.
She had fun too.	Ol hem hezil etdi.
Not there	Ol ýerde ýok
Of course, he couldn't see me.	Elbetde, ol meni görüp bilmedi.
We don't need much.	Bize kän zat gerek däl.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, şeýle boldy.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
You don't have to do anything else.	Başga hiç zat etmeli däl.
As beautiful and beautiful as you are.	Özüňiz ýaly ajaýyp, ajaýyp.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
Now there was someone.	Indi kimdir biri bardy.
I don't think you'll need it either.	Şeýle hem size gerek bolar öýdemok.
I'm nothing anymore	Men indi hiç zat däl
How to get it.	Ony nädip almaly.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
Here is one that will help you.	Ine size kömek etjek biri.
He immediately began to make noise.	Derrew ses edip başlady.
Like everyone else.	Hemmeler ýaly.
He came out immediately.	Derrew çykdy.
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
He could not sleep.	Ol uklap bilmedi.
In fact, it is not.	Aslynda beýle hökman däl.
Money should still be there.	Pul henizem şol ýerde bolmaly.
It should be.	Bolmaly.
Of course there is.	Elbetde bar.
Definitely.	Elbetde hökman.
This is not a good thing.	Bu gowy zat däl.
He understood me.	Ol maňa düşündi.
Oh, he is.	Aý, ol.
You have to go somewhere.	Bir ýere gitmeli.
It looks great.	Gaty gowy görünýär.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
I can't agree.	Men razy bolup bilemok.
It is very difficult to decide if it is good or bad.	Gowy ýa-da erbet bolsa, karar bermek gaty kyn.
Good news.	Gowy habar.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Muny şeýle etmeli.

Because it has to be that way.	Sebäbi şeýle bolmaly.
He could not see me.	Ol meni görüp bilmedi.

There was nothing else to be there.	Ol ýerde bolmaly başga zat ýokdy.

Now we can both enjoy it.	Indi ikimizem lezzet alyp bileris.
It doesn't have to be.	Ol bolmaly däl.
It was night.	Gije boldy.
It happened to him.	Bu onuň bilen boldy.
It was yesterday.	Düýn şol gün boldy.
He wanted more time.	Ol has köp wagt isledi.
I gave it to him.	Men oňa berdim.
You don't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däl.
I was worried about you.	Men sen hakda alada etdim.
Hope is beautiful.	Umyt owadan zat.
What did he get.	Ol näme aldy.
He did.	Ol etdi.
Such work is not easy.	Şeýle iş aňsat däl.
Oh, I don't have to tell you that.	Aý, muny maňa aýtmak hökman däl.
Taking a new path home.	Öýe täze ýol alyp.
This is a big deal.	Bu uly mesele.
That's a bad idea.	Bu erbet pikir.
Do it well.	Ony gowy et.
Mon.	Sen.
We have to tell you something.	Bize bir zat aýtmaly.
You can see for yourself.	Özüňiz görüp bilersiňiz.
Many words	Köp söz.
He didn't have to do that.	Ol muny etmeli däldi.
I decided.	Men karar berdim.
I'm not doing that right.	Men muny dogry etmeýärin.
I know he did.	Men onuň edenini bilýärin.
Now, he couldn't care less.	Häzir, ol bu barada alada edip bilmedi.
Tell me who did it.	Muny kimiň edenini aýdyň.
I have nothing to say to him.	Oňa aýdyp biljek zady ýok.
No more.	Indi ýok.
There can only be one or the other.	Diňe bir ýa-da başga bir zat bolup biler.
It was such a wonderful day.	Şeýle ajaýyp gün boldy.
He knows that too.	Muny hem bilýär.
I'll have to go to work.	Men işe gitmeli bolaryn.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
Right here, right now.	Edil şu ýerde, edil şu wagt.
They also have.	Olar hem bar.
He said he wanted me.	Ol meni isleýändigini aýtdy.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
Oh, that's interesting.	Aý, bu gyzykly.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
Doing what happens.	Bolýan zatlary etmek.
They are wonderful.	Olar ajaýyp.
I think that day will be soon.	Şol gün ýakyn wagtda bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
That's a lot of ideas.	Bu köp pikir.
In fact, it is often the case.	Aslynda, köplenç beýle etmeli däl.
The idea is this.	Pikir şu.
Men.	Men.
It didn't look like it.	Ol beýle däl ýalydy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
He wants to be like me.	Ol hem meniň ýaly isleýär.
This is it.	Bu şu ýerde.
In fact, it could be a problem.	Aslynda bu mesele bolup biler.
I want more time.	Has köp wagt isleýärin.
It was good once with him.	Bu onuň bilen bir gezek gowy boldy.
You will be next.	Indiki bolarsyňyz.
It really helped.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek etdi.
Not a problem.	Mesele däl.
In fact, I don't think so.	Aslynda beýle pikir etmeýärin.
Maybe you can think a little about yourself.	Belki, özüňiz hakda birneme pikir edip bilersiňiz.
I thought it was just me.	Men diňe özüm diýip pikir etdim.
I can never be	Men hiç wagt bolup bilemok
I thought about it a lot.	Men bu barada köp pikir etdim.
You can say that.	Muny aýdyp bilersiňiz.
Then came the necessities.	Soň zerur zatlar geldi.
You can try this.	Muny synap görüp bilersiňiz.
This should not be enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl bolmaly.
They are still with me.	Olar henizem meniň bilen.
The problem seemed to be too great.	Kynçylyk gaty uly ýalydy.
This man was almost there for me.	Bu adam maňa diýen ýalydy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
It would be great.	Ajaýyp bolardy.
You will need it.	Size gerek bolar.
You have to go.	Gitmeli.
I should never have done that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmeli däldim.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
Not every night, of course.	Elbetde, her gije däl.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ol ýerde erbet zat ýok.
That's it.	Ol şol.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
I couldn't sleep.	Men uklap bilmedim.
Now, here it is.	Indi, şu ýerde.
It was not an easy decision.	Bu aňsat karar däldi.
Someone today.	Biri şu gün.
It was not happy.	Bu bagtly däldi.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
I want it so bad that it's good.	Gowy bolmagy üçin gaty erbet isleýärin.
Oh, very good.	Aý, gaty gowy.
He did not want trouble.	Ol kynçylyk islemedi.
It was as good as anything.	Her zat ýaly mümkin boldy.
Work, work	Iş, iş
They were there once.	Olar bir gezek bardy.
He could not do anything about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat edip bilmedi.
I thought it was okay.	Bolýar diýip pikir etdim.
We are here.	Biz şu ýerde.
Not everyone can get what they want.	Her kim islän zadyny alyp bilmez.
This is a strange word.	Bu bir geň söz.
I don’t know how he knows, but he knows.	Nädip bilýändigini bilemok, ýöne bilýär.
'	'
Always this time.	Hemişe bu gezek.
You have dinner.	Size nahar bar.
I have to tell you the truth.	Maňa hakykaty aýtmaly.
I am very impressed with that.	Men muňa gaty haýran.
Adam.	Adam.
It's really stressful.	Hakykatdanam gaty biynjalyk.
He knows this very well.	Ol muny gaty gowy bilýär.
I found it difficult.	Men muny kyn gördüm.
He was there too.	Ol hem bardy.
Must vote.	Ses bermeli.
Happy with me	Men bilen bagtly
It would be interesting.	Gyzykly bolardy.
I didn't think about it.	Bu hakda pikir etmedim.
He is so busy.	Ol şeýle bir meşgul.
It's easier.	Bu has aňsat.
Maybe too much.	Belki gaty köp.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
He said, "You."	Ol: «Sen» diýdi.
Is that so? 	Bu şeýlemi?
Very strange news.	Gaty geň habar.
I'm not stupid	Men samsyk däl
That shouldn't be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däl.
Just like that.	Edil şol wagt ýaly.
I can't see it	Men muny görüp bilemok
Good time for that.	Munuň üçin gowy wagt.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Everyone did.	Hemmeler şeýle etdi.
Not really a good thing at all.	Aslynda aslynda gowy zat däl.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
This is a little bit that I want to draw your attention to.	Bu size üns bermek isleýän biraz.
It's already morning.	Bu eýýäm irden.
I think that should be true.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry bolmaly.
She had a lot of fun.	Ol gaty hezil etdi.
There is no hope here.	Bu ýerde umyt ýok.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
This was not really an issue for us.	Bu hakykatdanam biziň üçin asla mesele däldi.
I will never be so hard.	Men hiç haçan beýle kyn bolmaz.
I'm having fun	Men hezil edýärin
In fact, that's exactly what he wants.	Aslynda bu onuň isleýän zady.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
And then he did.	Soň bolsa etdi.
That's right.	Dogry ýaly.
I have a lot to do.	Meniň etmeli köp zadym bar.
He has.	Ol bar.
Of course he can.	Elbetde edip biler.
This was not really a question.	Bu hakykatdanam sorag däldi.
I heard about it.	Men bu hakda eşitdim.
And then he did it again.	Soň bolsa ýene etdi.
Good job	Gowy iş.
In fact, he has said this several times.	Aslynda muny birnäçe gezek aýtdy.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
That says a lot.	Bu köp zady aýdýar.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I think I really should.	Men hakykatdanam almaly diýip pikir edýärin.
He did not do well for himself.	Ol özi üçin gowy iş etmedi.
Oh, no.	Aý, ýok.
He didn't need any more advice.	Oňa başga maslahat gerek däldi.
It would be better.	Has gowy bolardy.
Of course I did.	Elbetde etdim.
I can't tell you.	Maňa aýdyp biljek däl.
This issue has been around for some time.	Birnäçe wagt bäri bu mesele bolup gelýär.
Good job!	Gowy iş!
Me, it's me.	Men, bu men.
Very close.	Gaty ýakyn.
Ma'am.	Bu.
He started home.	Ol öýe başlady.
You are there.	Sen şol ýerde.
He has been here only a month.	Ol bu ýerde diňe bir aý boldy.
Similarly,	Edil şonuň ýaly,
I can't see	Men görüp bilemok
He started working.	Ol işe başlady.
It was not a good word for them.	Olar üçin bu gowy söz däldi.
There was no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
The man has been dead for several weeks.	Ol adam birnäçe hepde boldy.
It will not be happy, but it will be.	Bagtly bolmaz, ýöne bolar.
And then it's not pretty.	Soň bolsa, owadan däl.
It's over.	Soň boldy.
I'm not sure how this happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny doly bilemok.
They are still for you.	Olar henizem siziň üçin.
That year.	Şol ýyl.
I think this is great.	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir edýärin.
It could be the same.	Şeýle hem bolup biler.
I knew.	Men bilýärdim.
He needs something bad.	Oňa bir erbet zat gerek.
.	.
I can't think of any song.	Hiç hili aýdym hakda pikir edip bilemok.
You have to go now	Indi gitmeli
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
You have to go now.	Indi gitmeli.
He is always at home.	Ol hemişe öýde bolýar.
Everyone wants to.	Hemmeler isleýär.
He decided to do what he did.	Eden zadyny etmek kararyna geldi.
It helps, but it is not necessary.	Kömek edýär, ýöne zerur däl.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
He was just not right.	Ol diňe dogry däldi.
He knows this very well.	Ol muny gaty gowy bilýär.
I took a different path.	Men başga ýol aldym.
Maybe he is.	Belki, ol.
I think that would be great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy bolar.
The decision does not do that.	Karar beýle zat etmeýär.
Now it's as bad as ever.	Indi öňküsi ýaly erbet.
This will not be true.	Bu dogry bolmaz.
He didn't want to talk.	Ol gürleşmek islemedi.
That's what he called her.	Ine, oňa jaň etdi.
It really happened.	Bu hakykatdanam boldy.
That's it.	Ýol.
It really is.	Hakykatdanam şeýle.
I'm big	Men uly
I can't think of anything else.	Başga zat hakda pikir edip bilemok.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
It can't be, it can't be, it can't be, it can't be.	Bolmaz, bolmaz, bolup bilmez, bolup bilmez.
He took it.	Ony aldy.
Now you have to do it.	Indi muny şeýle etmeli.
I know there is more to it.	Munuň üçin has köp zadyň bardygyny bilýärin.
I need this.	Bu maňa gerek.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ol hakykatdanam şeýle etmeli.
The book is somewhere, probably.	Kitap bir ýerde, ähtimal.
I think it would be good.	Gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
It must be wonderful to be so beautiful.	Şeýle bir ajaýyp bolmak ajaýyp bolmaly.
Really great help for us.	Hakykatdanam biziň üçin uly kömek.
Someone has to say that.	Kimdir biri muny aýtmaly.
I did it once.	Bir gezek etdim.
This is a great opportunity.	Bu uly mümkinçilik.
Because we are not.	Sebäbi biz ýok.
I think you can do it well.	Oňa gowy edip bilersiňiz diýip pikir edýärin.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
Always there	Elmydama bar.
It will be.	Bolar.
Of course, there is no such thing.	Elbetde, munuň ýaly zat ýok.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
Now he is gone.	Indi ol gitdi.
So that's bad.	Şonuň üçin bu erbet.
He did not want to go there.	Ol ol ýere gitmek islemedi.
Here's how you can help.	Ine, oňa kömek edip bilersiňiz.
Where is he now	Häzir nirede.
You are very smart	Sen gaty akylly
Everyone is different.	Her bir adam başga.
There are two possibilities here.	Bu ýerde iki mümkinçilik bar.
Something can happen twice.	Iki gezek bir zat bolup biler.
Police immediately arrested him.	Polisiýa ony derrew tussag etdi.
He wanted nothing more than this.	Bu iş bilen başga hiç zat islemedi.
I don't want that	Men muny islämok
There is a reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi bar.
This is one.	Bu bir.
The night was crazy.	Gije däli boldy.
Which is hard, man.	Haýsy kyn, adam.
This is not crazy.	Bu däli däl.
This is not easy for him.	Bu onuň üçin aňsat däl.
I will be with you	Men seniň bilen bolaryn
It was a great meal.	Bu ajaýyp nahar boldy.
She is beautiful.	Ol owadan.
He said it was not.	Ol beýle däldigini aýtdy.
I have	Mende bar
Of course, he didn't tell me that.	Elbetde, ol muny maňa aýtmady.
Two, nothing.	Iki, hiç zat ýok.
Not from me.	Menden däl.
That this could happen several times.	Munuň birnäçe gezek bolup biljekdigini.
I made money like that.	Munuň ýaly pul aldym.
He knew what to do.	Näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
You have to rest.	Dynç almaly.
OK!	Bolýar!
It has to go.	Bu gitmeli.
Now he thought.	Indi pikir etdi.
He needs to get some more for him.	Ol onuň üçin ýene birneme almaly.
You don't have to do that	Muny etmeli däl
Maybe never.	Belki hiç wagt bolmaz.
You are still here.	Sen henizem şu ýerde.
No no no.	Ýok ýok ýok.
One day he rested.	Bir gün dynç aldy.
I really want to.	Men gaty isleýärin.
I don't want that	Men muny islämok
I don't know how that happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilemok.
I think it will come soon.	Meniň pikirimçe, ýakyn wagtda geler.
They are no more.	Olar indi ýok.
Where to rest?	Nirede dynç almaly?
And then it happens.	Soň bolsa şeýle bolýar.
A lot can happen.	Köp zat bolup biler.
It still exists.	Ol henizem bar.
He admitted this.	Ol muny boýun aldy.
Maybe you can help me.	Belki, maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz.
I saw him yesterday morning.	Men ony düýn irden gördüm.
I'm not very ready.	Men gaty taýyn däl.
I need something very bad.	Maňa gaty erbet zat gerek.
Only so.	Diňe şeýle.
It took a lot of work.	Bu köp iş etmeli boldy.
Sounds a little crazy.	Biraz däli ýaly.
You have to stop this.	Muny bes etmeli.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
I hope so.	Umyt edýärin.
He called several times.	Birnäçe gezek jaň etdi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Nothing like that anymore.	Indi beýle zat ýok.
It's been a few days.	Birnäçe gün boldy.
I really	Men hakykatdanam.
We are there.	Biz şol ýerde.
I've had a few.	Mende birnäçe boldy.
I hope this is not the case.	Bu dogry däl diýip umyt edýärin.
It's too far.	Entek gaty uzak.
There is something for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin bir zat bar.
It was like everything.	Hemme zat ýalydy.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
You can see it immediately.	Derrew görüp bilersiňiz.
Bad word, even.	Erbet söz, hatda.
Not that year, not that year.	Şol ýyl däl, hiç ýyl däl.
He just didn't say anything to himself.	Diňe indi özüne hiç zat aýtmady.
There really isn’t much here.	Hakykatdanam bu ýerde kän bir zat ýok.
He did just that.	Ol edil şeýle etdi.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
And he started with nothing.	Ol bolsa hiç zat bilen başlady.
Better yet, maybe.	Has gowy, belki.
I have not tried this.	Men muny synap görmedim.
Really enough.	Hakykatdanam, ýeterlik.
We should not be taken away.	Bizi alyp gitmeli däl.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
And then he got permission.	Soň bolsa, rugsat aldy.
Who is the most beautiful girl here?	Bu ýerde iň owadan gyz kim?
How can you do that?	Muny nädip edip bilersiňiz.
Almost a lot.	Köp diýen ýaly.
What is this?	Bu näme?.
Surprisingly, one day it came.	Geň galdy, bir gün geldi.
No news.	Habar ýok.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
This is not much.	Bu kän däl.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
He doesn't seem to be able to do that.	Muny edip bilmeýän ýaly.
I didn't think of any help.	Hiç hili kömek bermek hakda pikir etmedim.
To do that	Muny etmek.
I can't think of anything like that.	Men bu hakda beýle pikir edip bilemok.
That's a bad idea for me.	Bu meniň üçin erbet pikir.
He did not immediately respond.	Ol derrew jogap bermedi.
And then,	Soň bolsa,
This was not very true.	Bu gaty dogry däldi.
You will have to call him.	Oňa jaň etmeli bolarsyňyz.
I'll help you if I need to.	Maňa gerek bolsa, size kömek ederin.
Only.	Diňe.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
What would happen?	Näme bolardy?
Here he is.	Ine, ol şu ýerde.
Because it wasn’t just me.	Sebäbi bu diňe men däldi.
Two people and me.	Iki adam we men.
It doesn't seem to be a big deal.	Bu uly bir zat däl ýaly.
He knew a lot about her.	Ol hakda köp zat bilýärdi.
Enough once.	Bir gezek ýeterlik.
He is telling the truth.	Ol hakykaty aýdýar.
I don't do that much.	Men beýle kän etmeýärin.
I can see it for myself.	Men muny özüm görüp bilýärin.
What happens, what happens.	Näme bolýar, näme bolýar.
I think so.	Men şeýle pikir edýärin.
You can only answer that.	Muňa diňe jogap berip bilersiňiz.
Help for today	Şu gün üçin kömek
And that is exactly what happened.	Bu bolsa öňküsi ýaly boldy.
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
It will be more difficult.	Bu has kyn bolar.
This is very possible.	Bu gaty mümkin.
He did it.	Ony şeýle etdi.
There were other things.	Başga zatlar bardy.
Everyone seems to be against you.	Her kim size garşy bir zat ýaly bolup görünýär.
He decided.	Ol karar berdi.
This is not for us.	Bu biziň üçin ýok.
Not here.	Bu ýerde däl.
I really	Men hakykatdanam.
Bad, you're stupid.	Erbet, sen samsyk.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Okay, that’s not really the word.	Bolýar, aslynda bu söz däl.
There was no thought.	Hiç hili pikir ýokdy.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
Of course, this was not the case.	Elbetde, bu beýle däldi.
In fact, there is no other way.	Aslynda başga ýol ýok.
What a summer!	Nähili tomus!
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
You can tell.	Siz aýdyp bilersiňiz.
We are not very good at it.	Biz muňa gaty gowy däl.
I do not have and will not.	Mende ýok we bolmaz.
I think there is a good reason for that.	Munuň gowy sebäbi bar öýdýärin.
Here we are for them.	Ine, biz olar üçin.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
I am a girl.	Men gyz.
It was good for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin gowy boldy.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
One day it's just too much for you.	Bir gün diňe seniň üçin gaty köp bolýar.
It was against me.	Bu maňa garşy çykdy.
Did he do it right? 	Dogry etdi?
Not long.	Uzak däl.
She was a girl.	Gyz boldy.
I can't say what he thinks.	Onuň näme pikir edýändigini aýdyp bilemok.
Seriously, that would be great.	Çynlakaý, bu gaty gowy bolar.
He just wanted to see you one last time.	Diňe sizi soňky gezek görmek isledi.
He does the same.	Ol hem şeýle edýär.
I thought about you yesterday.	Düýn sen hakda pikir etdim.
I thought about it again.	Bu hakda ýene pikir etdim.
Right now there is no work.	Edil häzir hiç hili iş ýok.
He had to do it.	Ol bu işi etmeli boldy.
Of course, I thought many times.	Elbetde, köp gezek pikir etdim.
I can see again.	Men ýene görüp bilýärin.
No one else knows about it.	Bu hakda başga hiç kim bilenok.
He didn't have to be.	Onuň özi bolmaly däldi.
This was not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däldi.
I want to be with them.	Men olar bilen bile bolmak isleýärin.
This is a question.	Bu sorag.
You have to do almost everything.	Her zat diýen ýaly etmeli.
You have an opportunity.	Size bir mümkinçilik bar.
No one knows	Hiç kim bilenok
Really	Hakykatdanam.
Everything was there.	Ol ýerde hemme zat bardy.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
I didn't need to.	Maňa gerek däldi.
We are not there yet.	Biz entek ýok.
I really need it	Maňa hakykatdanam gerek
I saw it	Men muny gördüm
I had no idea.	Mende hiç hili pikir ýokdy.
And then he gave.	Soň bolsa berdi.
He never wanted to enjoy it.	Ol hiç wagt lezzet bermek islemedi.
It’s also about being human.	Bu hem adam bolmak hakda.
No one.	Hiç kim ýok.
I really need it.	Maňa hakykatdanam gerek.
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
She is happy.	Ol bagtly.
I have a few questions.	Mende birnäçe sorag bar.
And then he said, but not now.	Soň bolsa aýtdy, ýöne häzir däl.
Such a long time	Şeýle uzak wagt.
To see if it exists.	Onuň bardygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny görmek üçin.
That doesn't help much.	Bu maňa köp kömek edip bilmez.
I really do.	Men hakykatdanam edýärin.
Trouble, he was right.	Kynçylyk, dogry aýtdy.
I don't know about anyone else	Başga hiç kim hakda bilemok
This book is for everyone and everyone.	Bu kitap her kim we hemmeler üçin.
She was great.	Ol gaty gowy boldy.
This is because of this.	Munuň sebäbi şu.
He did nothing else.	Mundan başga hiç zat etmedi.
I don't think so.	Men pikir etmeýärin.
Just right.	Diňe dogry.
That won't be good for me either.	Bu hem meniň üçin gowy bolmaz.
I hope so.	Dogry diýip umyt edýärin.
I think it would be great.	Ajaýyp bolardy diýip pikir edýärin.
I asked to leave every year.	Her ýyl gitmegi haýyş etdim.
Now there is.	Indi bar.
I was with someone.	Men kimdir biri bilen boldum.
The only reason.	Diňe sebäbi.
Everything seems to be right.	Hemme zat dogry ýaly.
Anyone can say whatever they want.	Her kim islän zadyny aýdyp biler.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Of course it is possible.	Elbetde, mümkin.
Here it is, it came, it came.	Ine, geldi, geldi, geldi.
Hope is here.	Umyt şu ýerde.
No need for a reason anymore.	Indi bir sebäp gerek däl.
Of course, one day he told me to do something.	Elbetde, bir gün maňa bir zat et diýdi.
This makes him very anxious.	Bu bolsa ony gaty biynjalyk edýär.
This is not yet true.	Munuň üçin entek dogry däl.
I do nothing.	Men hiç zat etmeýärin.
I think it might be interesting.	Gyzykly bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
They are not like you.	Olar seniň ýaly däl.
I was somewhere.	Men bir ýerde boldum.
It just can't be me.	Bu diňe men bolup bilemok.
It won't be too bad.	Gaty erbet bolmaz.
Lots and lots of money.	Köp we köp pul.
Someone knows better.	Biri has gowy bilýär.
This is not the right way to go.	Bu dogry ýol däl.
There was something.	Bir zat bardy.
It could be worse.	Has erbet bolup biler.
For life.	Durmuş üçin.
That's right- this is about time.	Dogry, bir gezek.
Not really about that.	Aslynda bu hakda däl.
This is better.	Bu has gowy.
It would be harder to be human.	Adam bolmak has kyn bolardy.
He asked me.	Ol menden sorady.

They are not good for me.	Olar meniň üçin gowy zat däl.
Like a few days.	Birnäçe gün ýaly.
This is about me now.	Bu indi men hakda.
Quick question.	Çalt sorag.
Of course	Elbetde,
There is such a thing.	Şeýle bir zat bar.
This is a word.	Munuň özi bir söz.
The moon is very happy.	Aý gaty bagtly.
I knew it.	Men muny gowy bilýärdim.
That shouldn't be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däl.
It may take months to do that.	Belki, muny etmek üçin birnäçe aý bar bolsa gerek.
Not much.	Kän däl.
I do not have.	Mende ýok.
The same is true today.	Häzirki wagtda hem şeýle bolýar.
Of course it can be said in a better way.	Elbetde has gowy söz bilen aýdyp bolar.
It may take some time.	Munuň üçin birneme wagt gerek bolup biler.
Now you know better than to do that.	Indi muny etmekden has gowy bilýärsiň.
It won't be long	Uzak bolmaz
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
I think he did.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şeýle etdi.
She didn't need another girl.	Oňa başga bir gyz gerek däldi.
So we have.	Şonuň üçin biz bar.
There was something wrong with that.	Bu hakda diňe dogry däl bir zat bardy.
He asked.	Ol muny sorady.
It used to be.	Ozal bardy.
Of course, tonight.	Elbetde, bu agşam.
I was in the right place at the right time.	Dogry ýerde we dogry wagtda boldum.
I hope I can help.	Kömek edip bilerin diýip umyt edýärin.
No one told me about it.	Bu hakda hiç kim maňa aýtmady.
'	'
I didn’t think it was possible.	Mümkin diýip pikir etmedim.
That's it.	Ine, şeýle.
Okay.	Bolýar.
He is everything and everything else.	Ol hemme zat we başga zat.
They are here.	Olar şu ýerde.
It could be worse here.	Bu ýerde has erbet bolup biler.
This is not easy, it is not.	Bu aňsat däl, aslynda beýle däl.
I have heard this many times.	Men muny köp gezek eşitdim.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
I know he will.	Etjekdigini bilýärin.
Almost at home	Öýde diýen ýaly
That man lives in that house.	Ol adam şol öýde ýaşaýar.
I have to be ready for it.	Men oňa taýyn bolmaly.
Whatever you need.	Näme gerek bolsa.
Last night	Düýn agşam.
I wonder what will happen.	Näme bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
We can't be together.	Biz bile bolup bilmeris.
Three years	Üç ýyl
That makes it great.	Bu ajaýyp edýär.
They are on the ground.	Olar ýerde.
That's the way it is now.	Indi şeýle boldy.
Great	Ajaýyp.
This is not clear.	Bu aýdyň däl.
If he has to, he has to.	Ol etmeli bolsa, etmeli.
It was hard for me.	Bu meniň üçin kyn boldy.
He just couldn't say everything.	Ol diňe hemme zady aýdyp bilmedi.
It should be fun !.	Gyzykly bolmaly!.
I hope it helps.	Size kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
Then we had two.	Soň ikimiz bardy.
He is right.	Dogry aýdýar.
I really	Men hakykatdanam.
Very interesting news.	Gaty gyzykly habar.
He can't go back there anymore.	Indi ol ýere gaýdyp bilmeýär.
He understood that.	Ol muňa düşündi.
He knew it by heart.	Ol muny ýatdan bilýärdi.
About time.	Wagt hakda.
Maybe he doesn't know.	Belki bilmez.
You don't have to do anything else here.	Bu ýerde başga hiç zat etmeli däl.
I did not call	Men jaň etmedim
He didn't think about it.	Ol bu hakda pikir etmedi.
Not just him.	Diňe, onuň özi däldi.
To do with it.	Onuň bilen etmek.
Tell me about it.	Bu hakda maňa aýdyň.
We have to be fast now.	Biz häzir çalt bolmaly.
He also came back here.	Ol hem bu ýere gaýdyp geldi.
No one knew what he was doing or what he was doing.	Hiç kim ony ýa-da näme edenini bilmeýärdi.
I didn't do that often.	Men muny köplenç etmedim.
They are at home.	Olar öýde.
He seemed stupid.	Ol samsyk ýalydy.
It was really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy boldy.
I have it now.	Mende häzir bar.
It would be a good day.	Gowy gün bolardy.
The answer, of course.	Jogap, elbetde.
It started.	Ol başlady.
Three for two.	Iki üçin üç.
He thought how strange.	Nähili geň, diýip pikir etdi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe bir zat.
He advised me.	Ol maňa maslahat berdi.
This is indeed true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry.
I'm sorry about that.	Men oňa gynanýaryn.
What to do today?	Bu gün näme etmeli?
I'm just thinking about you.	Men diňe sen hakda pikir edýärin.
It doesn't have to be.	Bolmagy hökman däl.
He now lives there.	Ol häzir şol ýerde ýaşaýar.
He said it was not.	Ol beýle däldigini aýtdy.
And then two things happened.	Soň bolsa iki zat boldy.
There was a good reason for that.	Munuň gowy sebäbi bardy.
He was not at home at all.	Öýde asla ýokdy.
He was nowhere.	Ol hiç ýerde däldi.
Everyone sang.	Hemmeler aýdym aýtdy.
I saw how it was with him.	Men onuň bilen nähili bolandygyny gördüm.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
I care about you.	Men sen hakda alada edýärin.
It would be nice to be home.	Öýde bolmak gowy bolardy.
Only good things.	Diňe gowy zatlar.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
Time for a message.	Habar üçin wagt.
It's too early to say.	Muny aýtmak üçin entek ir.
Very good, very good.	Gaty gowy, gaty gowy.
How it should be.	Bu nähili bolmaly.
What do you think he is doing?	Siziň pikiriňizçe ol nähili iş edýär?
More questions came.	Has köp sorag geldi.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
This is often the case.	Köplenç şeýle bolýar.
He thought something else.	Başga zat diýip pikir etdi.
Just a song.	Diňe aýdym.
Give me a hard day	Maňa kyn gün bermek
And then you.	Soň bolsa sen.
Not just himself.	Diňe özi däl.
It may or may not happen.	Bolup biler, bolup bilmez.
I really don't know	Men hakykatdanam bilemok
Maybe it would be great.	Belki gaty gowy bolardy.
Immediately there was another man.	Derrew başga bir adam boldy.
Now everything seemed to be gone.	Indi hemme zat ýok ýalydy.
No one helped him.	Hiç kim oňa kömek etmedi.
It must be very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly bolmaly.
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
He is now alone.	Ol indi ýeke boldy.
I think that's right.	Bu dogry diýip pikir edýärin.
And then he stayed there.	Soň bolsa ol ýerde galdy.
You have to rest.	Dynç almaly.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
Many, many times.	Köp, köp gezek.
I can already tell.	Men eýýäm aýdyp bilerin.
And then he got it twice.	Soň bolsa iki gezek aldy.
It's a smart thing to do.	Bu etmek gaty akylly zat.
Good.	Gowy.
Something was definitely wrong there.	Ol ýerde bir zat hökman dogry däldi.
No problem.	Kynçylyk ýok.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolmaz.
I can do it now	Men indi edip bilerin
He knows now.	Ol indi bilýär.
No one knows what message they can get.	Hiç kimiň haýsy habar alyp biljekdigini bilenok.
He is right there.	Ol edil şol ýerde.
Not as it is now.	Häzirki ýaly däl.
Strange, really weird.	Geň, hakykatdanam gaty geň.
I did not know	Bilmedim.
There is not much there.	Ol ýerde kän zat ýok.
He gave me the best advice.	Ol maňa iň gowy maslahat berdi.
A lot of work.	Köp iş.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
This idea is not new.	Bu pikir täze däl.
Then he went to school.	Soň bolsa mekdebe gitdi.
We were good at the time.	Biz şol wagt gowy.
He wants to go there.	Ol şol ýere baryp görmek isleýär.
Nothing and never.	Hiç zat we hiç haçan.
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
He also admitted this.	Ol hem muny boýun aldy.
I am happy for you.	Men seniň üçin begenýärin.
Just one of these many things is enough, too much.	Bu köp zadyň diňe biri ýeterlik, gaty köp.
It would be beautiful once.	Bir gezek owadan bolardy.
I am a girl.	Men gyz.
And back home	We öýe gaýdyp
Too many nowadays.	Häzirki wagtda gaty köp.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
At the same time	Şol bir wagtda.
He will do well.	Ol gowy eder.
He still does.	Ol henizem şeýle etdi.
That was not the case last year.	Geçen ýyl beýle däldi.
I think it should be great.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gaty gowy bolmaly.
I know, he didn't do that.	Bilýän, muny etmedi.
I know something that can help	Kömek edip biljek bir zady bilýärin
In fact, this is not true.	Aslynda bu düýbünden dogry däl.
It would be nice if possible.	Mümkin bolsa gowy bolardy.
I was no longer human	Men indi adam däldim
I need help.	Maňa kömek etmeli.
You don't have to decide.	Karar bermek hökman däl.
Not a bad thing.	Erbet zat däl.
There is a good reason for this.	Munuň gowy sebäbi bar.
Of course, this is for me.	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin.
I'm crazy enough to do that	Men muny etmäge ýeterlik däli
It was really bad.	Hakykatdanam erbet boldy.
That will be the case.	Şeýle bolar.
Someone to worry about.	Maňa alada etjek biri.
He was not going to do anything.	Ol hiç zat etjek däldi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolýar.
Which should be interesting.	Haýsy gyzykly bolmaly.
I knew everything about him	Men ol hakda hemme zady bilýärdim
You have to do it well.	Muny gowy etmeli.
He came back.	Ol gaýdyp geldi.
Oh, that's a bad thing.	Aý, bu erbet zat.
I saw and thought at the time.	Men şol wagt gördüm we pikir etdim.
I'm not like that yet.	Men henizem beýle däl.
More about us about them.	Biz hakda olar hakda has köp.
I hope it helped you.	Size kömek etdi diýip umyt edýärin.
I saw it once.	Men ony bir gezek gördüm.
I'm worried about him	Men ol hakda gaty alada edýärin
I will be alone.	Men ýeke özüm bolaryn.
It is very difficult for me, but it is necessary.	Meniň üçin gaty kyn, ýöne bu zerur.
And now I do it for myself.	Ine, indi muny özüm üçin edýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, häzir olar şeýle, bu gaty uly mesele däl.
That's all.	Diňe şol zat.
We have to.	Biz etmeli.
You and I are one.	Sen 'men, biz bir.
I know he doesn't.	Onuň ýokdugyny bilýärin.
This is us.	Bu biz.
I want to talk about you	Men sen hakda gürleşmek isleýärin
Something that can’t happen here	Bu ýerde bolup bilmeýän zat
Good.	Gowy.
I thought it would be easy	Aňsat bolar öýdüpdim
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
I think we are different	Meniň pikirimçe, biz başga
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hakda bolmaly.
It will be great tomorrow.	Ertir ajaýyp bolar.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
I didn’t know better at the time	Men şol wagt has gowy bilmeýärdim
The same thing.	Şol bir zat.
I didn't even see it.	Men hatda ony görmedim.
A lot was possible there.	Şol ýerde köp zat mümkin boldy.
I didn't want to know more	Has köp bilmek islemedim
I didn't want to see that	Muny görmek islemedim
Everything already looks good.	Eýýäm hemme zat gowy görünýär.
It's a lot of fun	Bu gaty hezil
Of course I will	Elbetde ederin
I thought everyone was gone	Hemmeler ýok boldy öýdüpdim
I didn't have to tell anyone	Hiç kime aýtmaly däldim
There were two people.	Iki adam bardy.
He is the only one.	Ol ýeke-täk.
This is not clear.	Bu aýdyň däl.
It's about fun.	Bu hezil hakda.
I make it very difficult.	Men muny gaty kyn edýärin.
I'm not anywhere	Men hiç ýerde däl
This is a good thing for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy zat.
I don't think he knows about it.	Ol bu hakda bilýär öýdemok.
I doubt it will.	Boljakdygyna şübhelenýärin.
Maybe it will help.	Belki kömek eder.
So you can buy.	Şonuň üçin satyn alyp bilersiňiz.
I didn't even see you	Men hatda seni görmedim
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol beýle däl.
Smart guy good guy	Akylly ýigit, gowy ýigit.
This is certainly not a new idea.	Bu, elbetde, düýbünden täze pikir däl.
The caller immediately understood.	Jaň eden adam derrew düşündi.
It really did tell me something.	Bu hakykatdanam maňa bir zat diýdi.
It should be.	Bu bolmaly.
Like you	Seniň ýaly
You don't need anyone here.	Bu ýerde size hiç kim gerek däl.
Just me	Diňe maňa.
Only here.	Diňe şu ýerde.
It's the smartest thing to do.	Bu etmek iň akylly zat.
I don't like it anymore	Men indi halamok
There was an interesting reason for that.	Munuň üçin gyzykly bir sebäp bardy.
He cares about the bar.	Ol bar hakda alada edýär.
I still don't often.	Men henizem köplenç beýle däl.
He already knew that.	Ol muny eýýäm bilýärdi.
The offer was surprising.	Teklip geň galdy.
I don't care about anything else	Başga zat hakda alada etmeýärin
He gave himself up.	Ol özüni berdi.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
This is really nothing.	Bu hakykatdanam hiç zat däl.
They are not.	Olar beýle zat däl.
This is just a song.	Bu diňe aýdym.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň etjek zady.
There was no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýokdy.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
I told her everything about you	Men oňa sen hakda hemme zady aýtdym
Not as before.	Öňküsi ýaly däl.
I can't do anything	Hiç zat edip bilemok
I have to do things right	Men zatlary dogry etmeli
He is right.	Dogry aýdýar.
There is a long way to go.	Uzak ýol bar.
I didn’t know what he was doing now	Men onuň indi näme edendigini bilmedim
Just do these things.	Diňe şu zatlary et.
This is an interesting word.	Bu gyzykly söz.
I can't be alone with him	Men onuň bilen ýeke bolup bilemok
In fact, I never thought of it that way	Aslynda asla pikir etmedim
He doesn't want to do that either.	Ol hem muny etmek islemeýär.
I want to help you	Size kömek etmek isleýärin
I hope he can help me	Ol maňa kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin
I saw something else strange	Başga bir geň zady gördüm
He is still there.	Ol henizem şol ýerde.
I agree	Men razy boldum
This is good.	Bu gowy.

In fact, there are so many.	Aslynda hemme ýerde gaty köp.
Everyone is happy again.	Hemmeler ýene bagtly.

I don't want to talk about leaving.	Gitmek hakda başga gürleşmek islämok.
It would be a good watch.	Gowy sagat bolardy.
I hope it comes.	Geler diýip umyt edýärin.
He just wanted to see you.	Ol diňe seni görmek isledi.
I can't see	Men görüp bilemok
It always has been and always will be.	Elmydama bardy we hemişe bolar.
He said.	Diýdi.

This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
You know things.	Sen zatlary bilýärsiň.
They are not even close.	Olar hatda ýakyn hem däl.
I'm sorry about that	Men oňa gynanýaryn
Of course, this will not be necessary.	Elbetde, bu zerur bolmaz.
Everything was new.	Hemme zat täze boldy.
That can't be good.	Bu gowy bolup bilmez.
It was not like this in the morning.	Irden beýle däldi.
It was great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy boldy.
Just do the right thing.	Diňe dogry zady et.
I never do that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmeýärin.
It seems right to me.	Maňa dogry görünýär.
In fact, I had nothing to do with it	Aslynda etmeli zadym ýokdy
I actually suggested.	Aslynda teklip etdim.
He told me he had to do it again.	Ol maňa ýene bir gezek etmelidigini aýtdy.
I have to tell the police about it.	Men bu barada polisiýa aýtmaly.
This does not have to be the case.	Munuň beýle bolmagy hökman däl.
This is not the answer.	Bu jogap däl.
What do you think should be done?	Siziň pikiriňizçe näme etmeli?
I had no answer	Mende jogap ýokdy
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.

A few hours at a time.	Her gezek birnäçe sagat.
He said.	Ol şeýle diýdi.
There is no hope.	Umyt ýok.
I stayed here one night	Men bu ýerde bir gije boldum
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
I want to help you	Size kömek etmek isleýärin
It takes a few steps to do that.	Munuň üçin birneme ýol gerek.
That will be the case.	Şeýle bolar.
What else is needed?	Başga näme gerek?
I thought he might think about leaving	Ol gitmek hakda pikir edip biler öýdüpdim
I could not think of it again	Men bu hakda ýene pikir edip bilmedim
The problem was not there.	Mesele ol ýerde däldi.
I don’t care too much about that	Men bu barada gaty bir alada etmeýärin
he said.	- diýdi.
This can happen to you too.	Bu hem siziň üçin bolup biler.

I just want to be together	Men diňe bile bolmak isleýärin
I can't say anything	Men hiç zat aýdyp biljek däl
There are two issues here.	Bu ýerde iki mesele bar.
Not good, but good.	Gowy däl, ýöne gowy.
There was no one yet.	Entek hiç kim ýokdy.
This is not beautiful.	Bu owadan däl.
I didn't have to go	Men gitmeli däldim
I'm fine with that.	Men munuň bilen gowy.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.

This has always been the case.	Elmydama şeýle boldy.
I got it.	Men aldym.
If you have to, you have to go.	Bolmaly bolsa gitmeli.
I've given it to you before	Men muny öňem berdim
I have to be.	Bolmak üçin men bolmaly.
Serious things here.	Bu ýerde çynlakaý zatlar.
He didn't want anything.	Ol hiç zady islemedi.
There was nothing you could do about it.	Seniň edip biljek zadyň ýokdy.
I have to give it to you	Men muny size bermeli
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Mesele şeýle.
It will be a big night.	Uly gije bolar.

This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
That’s about that summer.	Ine, şol tomus hakda.

He was not ready for that.	Ol muňa taýyn däldi.
I couldn't tell you how many times	Size näçe gezek aýdyp bilmedim
There is no one to help you.	Size kömek etjek hiç kim ýok.
He returned a week later.	Bir hepde soň gaýdyp geldi.

Three times late.	Üç gezek gijä galdy.
I knew it was impossible	Munuň mümkin däldigini bilýärdim
Only two months.	Diňe iki aý.

I didn't think about it	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim
There are several reasons for this	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar
I think that's a good thing	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy zat
He doesn't like anyone.	Ol hiç kimi halamaýar.
You don't have to answer it.	Oňa jogap bermek hökman däl.

This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.

He called to let me know.	Ol maňa habar bermek üçin jaň etdi.
That was the problem.	Bu mesele boldy.
I am against it.	Men muňa garşy.
I think it will be good for his job	Öz işi üçin gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
And it was fun.	We hezil boldy.

And then it happened.	Soň bolsa şeýle boldy.

No one knows everything about me.	Hiç kim meniň hakda hemme zady bilmeýär.
There was a man who thought about it.	Bu hakda pikir eden bir adam bardy.
I had to answer.	Men jogap bermeli boldum.
I want to do it all with you	Hemmesini seniň bilen etmek isleýärin
There may be more.	Has köp bolup biler.

OK, that's me.	Bolýar, bu men.

It was the same now.	Indi edil şonuň ýalydy.
This is easy money.	Bu aňsat pul.
He decided something about it.	Ol hakda bir zatlar karar berdi.
Everything should be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolmaly.

OK, that's me.	Bolýar, bu men.
He thinks he doesn't really like me	Ol hakykatdanam meni halamaýar öýdýän

He couldn't see it very well.	Ol muny gaty görüp bilmedi.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I promised him	Men oňa söz berdim

I think you are very good	Meniň pikirimçe, siz gaty gowy
There are two possible reasons for this.	Muny iki sebäp bolup biler.
Must have offered before.	Öň teklip eden bolmaly.

They must have wanted me so badly.	Olar meni gaty erbet islän bolmaly.
I don't know how he did that.	Muny nädip edendigini bilemok.
What did I do?	Men näme etdim.
There seemed to be no one right with him.	Hiç haçan onuň bilen dogry adam ýok ýalydy.

That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
Everyone does that.	Her kim muny edýär.

It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
No idea.	Asla pikir ýok.

Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
That was his decision.	Bu onuň kararyna geldi.

It's hard to see those things.	Şol zatlary görmek kyn.

Not good.	Gowy däl.
I never thought it would be so difficult	Munuň beýle kyn boljakdygyny pikir etmedim
It was as if you really wanted to.	Siz hakykatdanam isleýän ýalydy.
You have to enjoy it	Mundan lezzet almaly

I think there was a reason for that	Meniň pikirimçe, munuň sebäbi bardy

This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
You have to do something.	Bir zat etmeli.
The news was for me.	Habar meniň üçin boldy.
He makes me crazy.	Ol meni däli edýär.
You and no one else.	Siz we başga hiç kim ýok.

I have seen him several times	Men ony birnäçe gezek gördüm
I'll be smarter.	Men has akylly bolaryn.

Something like that is a big deal.	Munuň ýaly bir zat bolsa gaty uly zat.
He is just a strange man.	Ol diňe geň adam.
I know everyone wants to know	Her kimiň bilmek isleýändigini bilýärin
I didn’t know everything yet	Men entek hemme zady bilmedim

Someone else there.	Ol ýerde başga biri.
All you need to see is.	Diňe görmek zerur.
It really is.	Hakykatdanam şeýle.
I haven't been here in a while	Men bu ýerde birnäçe wagt bäri ýok
I think it was very difficult for him.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu oňa gaty kyn boldy.
Then it was a good time.	Soň gowy wagt boldy.
It's been a serious year.	Çynlakaý ýyl boldy.

I know it shouldn't be, but it did	Bolmaly däldigini bilýärin, ýöne şeýle etdi
I had no money	Mende pul ýokdy
It may disappear.	Ol ýok bolmagy mümkin.
You have to do a few things	Birnäçe zat etmeli
I really believe that.	Men muňa hakykatdanam ynanýaryn.
Like him	Ol ýaly.
It’s an issue that can’t do anything to help.	Kömek etmek üçin hiç zat edip bilmeýän mesele.
I really hope so.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle umyt edýärin.
I didn't want to talk about it	Bu hakda gürleşmek islemedim
He was not stupid.	Ol samsyk däldi.

Lots of crazy stuff.	Köp däli zatlar.

I have to be myself	Meniň özüm bolmaly
Last time I tried	Soňky gezek synap gördüm
In fact several times.	Aslynda birnäçe gezek.
I didn't really know that	Men muny hakykatdanam bilmeýärdim

Not just an idea.	Diňe bir pikir däl.

It won't happen to me.	Bu meniň bilen bolmaz.
I can't say that for myself	Muny özüm üçin aýdyp biljek däl
It was a good summer.	Tomus güni gowy boldy.
To be human.	Adam bolmak.
Because that's not the only thing that happened.	Sebäbi bu diňe bir bolup geçen zat däl.
He has been crazy for a week.	Bir hepde däli boldy.

This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
Of course, we can't.	Elbetde, biz beýle bolup bilmeris.

Three ideas this time.	Bu gezek üç pikir.
They are everywhere.	Olar hemme ýerde.
It looks really stupid to me.	Meniň üçin hakykatdanam samsyk ýaly görünýär.
I made another life for myself	Özüm üçin başga bir durmuş etdim
Just being a good person, being a great person.	Diňe gowy adam bolmak, ajaýyp adam bolmak.
I can't help it	Oňa kömek edip bilemok

He did not call again	Ol ýene jaň etmedi
That's right with me.	Dogry meniň bilen.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
Nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýok.

There or not.	Ol ýerde ýa-da ýok.
You have to do the best you can.	Iň gowy zady etmeli.
This is not new.	Bu täze däl.
Many things.	Köp zatlar.
A lot of people couldn’t get it.	Köp adam muny alyp bilmedi.

Oh, he said.	Aý, ol aýtdy.

This is no longer true.	Indi bu dogry däl.
I hoped it wasn’t about them yet	Men henizem olar hakda däl diýip umyt etdim
I've never been so smart	Men hiç wagt beýle akylly däldim

Tell him you think it's a good idea.	Gowy pikir bolar öýdýän oňa aýdyň.
She would be a beautiful girl.	Ol owadan gyz bolardy.

Here is the reason.	Ine, sebäp.
It's getting fun now.	Ol indi gyzykly bolýar.

It doesn't have to be this way.	Munuň ýaly bolmagy hökman däl.
For this.	Munuň üçin.
Then to me.	Soň maňa.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
I think it will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek bolar öýdýärin.
It was not very beautiful.	Bu gaty bir owadan däldi.
He destroyed it.	Ol ony ýok etdi.
You know, you know that.	Muny bilýärsiň, bilýärsiň.
I think that's really true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry diýip pikir edýärin.
I didn't do anything wrong	Men erbet zat etmedim

It's easy for me.	Meniň üçin bu aňsat.
I was never a happy person	Men hiç wagt bagtly adam däldim

Of course, no decision has to be made tonight.	Elbetde, bu gije hiç hili karar bermeli däl.

I want to do this	Bu işi etmek isleýärin
Money is one of the reasons.	Pul munuň bir sebäbi.
So you don't have to worry about them.	Şonuň üçin olar hakda alada etmeli däl.
I felt like I knew everything	Hemme zady bilýän ýaly boldum

I think it's good, but it's very short	Gowy, ýöne gaty gysga diýip pikir edýärin

And then he did nothing	Soň bolsa hiç zat etmedi
I could not speak.	Men gürläp bilmedim.
She is so beautiful.	Ol şeýle bir owadan.
I never saw him again.	Men ony ýene görmedim.
I'm sorry, but so be it.	Bagyşlaň, ýöne şeýle.
Not just an issue.	Diňe bir mesele däl.
I didn't think about it	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim

He doesn't seem to know.	Ol muny bilmeýän ýaly.
It will still take time	Oňa entek wagt gerek bolar
Just one.	Diňe bir.
I knew he could and would do it	Edip biljekdigini we etjekdigini bilýärdim
To be ready for it.	Oňa taýyn bolmagy üçin.

That was the problem.	Bu mesele boldy.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.

This is a bigger issue.	Bu has uly mesele.
I can't say enough good things about it.	Bu hakda ýeterlik gowy zat aýdyp bilemok.
I had a lot to do tonight	Şu gije etmeli köp zadym bardy
Now a lot of things are becoming clear	Indi köp zat aýdyň bolýar
I gave you a lot of time	Men saňa köp wagt berdim
Another voted.	Başga biri ses berdi.
And now he wants to know everything.	Indi bolsa hemme zady bilmek isleýär.
He made no mistake.	Ol hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedi.
He could tell when he had done a lot.	Haçan köp iş edendigini aýdyp bilýärdi.
They are still a problem.	Olar henizem mesele.
I think you need food.	Size nahar gerek diýip pikir edýärin.
He can be very right.	Ol gaty dogry aýdyp biler.
I decided	Men karar berdim
I've been here before	Men öňem şu ýerde boldum
I totally agree with that.	Men muňa doly razy.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Munuň gaty köp zady bar.
I really have to go now	Men hakykatdanam häzir gitmeli
Not only that.	Diňe däl.
I can't take it alone	Men ony ýeke alyp bilemok
I'm so scared.	Men gaty gorkýaryn.
Once upon a time.	Bir gezek.
I want to go with you	Men seniň bilen gitmek isleýärin
I know what he wants this time.	Bu gezek näme isleýändigini bilýärin.
I think this will be the first	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ilkinji bolar
Of course, I didn't think that would be helpful.	Elbetde, bu kömek edip bolmaz diýip pikir etdim.
Many books.	Köp kitap.
And that's not the reason.	Munuň sebäbi hem däl.
I can go home and sleep	Öýe gidip, uklap bilerin
I think he will come back to me	Maňa gaýdyp geler öýdýän
There are two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar.
He did nothing for you.	Ol saňa hiç zat etmedi.
I knew what to do.	Näme etmelidigini bilýärdim.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
Of course, this is a must.	Elbetde, bu wagt hökman.
I did it once.	Men muny bir gezek etdim.
It came to me.	Maňa geldi.
No, no.	Näme ýok, ýok.
Tell you more.	Size has köp zat aýtmak.
I don't know about that.	Men bu barada bilemok.
I care a lot for him	Men onuň üçin köp alada edýärin
He has to go.	Ol gitmeli.
He told her.	Ol oňa aýtdy.
I'm afraid not	Kän däl diýip gorkýaryn
It looks really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly görünýär.
It could be that.	Bu hem bolup biler.
I can't help it.	Men oňa kömek edip bilemok.
I have it everywhere	Mende hemme ýerde bar
That's great.	Bu ajaýyp zat.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
There was only so much good.	Diňe gaty gowy bir zat bardy.
Money can be fun.	Pul gyzykly bolup biler.
He thought it was long.	Uzak, diýip pikir etdi.
I shouldn't have done that	Men beýle etmeli däldim
This seems very strange.	Bu gaty geň görünýär.
I didn't know it was happening	Men munuň bolandygyny bilmedim
He hasn't been here for a long time.	Ol bu ýerde köp wagt bäri ýok.
I had nothing to do.	Meniň etjek zadym ýokdy.
I can't think anymore	Men indi pikir edip bilemok
I only had one question	Mende diňe bir sorag bardy
This could be more difficult this week.	Bu hepde has kyn bolup biler.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
Will be back to get more.	Has köp zat almak üçin gaýdyp geler.
Couldn't make another decision.	Başga bir karar berip bilmedi.
It's good, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Gowy "-diýdi.
I have other things	Mende başga zatlar bar
This is coming.	Bu gelýär.
Good and really.	Gowy we hakykatdanam.
The reason is the same.	Munuň sebäbi hem şeýle.
I knew it right away	Men muny derrew bilýärdim
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
And then again.	Soň bolsa ýene.
There is damage.	Zyýan bar.
Not really.	Aslynda ýok.
I thought a lot	Men köp pikir etdim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu şeýle bolmaly.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
He told me so.	Ol maňa şeýle diýdi.
This morning	Şu gün irden.
Very good, very good.	Gaty gowy, gaty gowy.
I thought about it a lot today	Men bu gün ol hakda köp pikir etdim
This is a great idea.	Bu ajaýyp pikir.
I decided.	Men karar berdim.
Good life	Gowy durmuş.
Money too.	Pul hem.
I don't want anything else	Başga zat islämok
I almost didn't	Men diýen ýaly etmedim
You are so beautiful	Sen gaty owadan
This is not the answer.	Bu jogap däl.
I tried to call him last night.	Düýn agşam oňa jaň etjek boldum.
If not here's a new product just for you!	Sebäbi ýok bolsa, hiç zat.
I couldn't go to you	Men saňa baryp bilmedim
I thought about the future	Geljek hakda pikir etdim
It looks so bad.	Bu gaty erbet görünýär.
I thought about it all day	Men ol hakda bütin gün pikir etdim
What do you think?	Siziň pikiriňizçe näme?
He did not want to talk to anyone.	Ol hiç kim bilen gürleşmek islemedi.
For me.	Meniň üçin.
It should be more interesting	Has gyzykly bolmaly
I want to be like that	Men şeýle bolmak isleýärin
This is possible.	Bu mümkin.
I could not see	Görüp bilmedim
He may have hoped long ago.	Köp wagt mundan ozal umyt eden bolmagy mümkin.
Of course, I didn’t want to bother him anymore.	Elbetde, men ony mundan beýläk biynjalyk etmek islemedim.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Oňa gaty çynlakaý zat ýok.
He gave what he wanted.	Islän zadyny berdi.
I had to admit this morning.	Şu gün irden boýun almaly boldum.
A lot has happened.	Köp zat boldy.
I think he wants me for him	Meniň pikirimçe, ol meni meniň üçin isleýär
I want to help you	Size kömek etmek isleýärin
He couldn't do that either.	Şeýle hem edip bilmedi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şeýle zatlar bolmaly.
This may not seem like a good idea.	Munuň özi gyzykly däl ýaly bolup biler.
Of course he wants to say a word about it.	Elbetde, bu barada bir söz aýtmak isleýär.
I could no longer be with anyone	Men indi hiç kim bilen bolup bilmedim
I don't need it.	Maňa gerek bolmaz.
I haven't been close to him in a while	Birnäçe wagt bäri oňa ýakyn däldim
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
It was fast.	Çalt boldy.
It will be easy for you.	Bu siziň üçin aňsat bolar.
I'm still here.	Men henizem şu ýerde.
You have to think about us.	Biz hakda pikir etmeli.
She is very smart.	Ol gaty akylly.
I couldn't think of anything else	Başga zat hakda pikir edip bilmedim
It's just like you.	Bu edil seniň ýaly.
Of course, nothing good.	Elbetde, gowy zat ýok.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
There are two things there.	Ol ýerde iki zat.
I have to take you back	Men seni ýene alyp gitmeli
Together with the next.	Indiki bilen bilelikde.
Of course singing is nothing.	Elbetde aýdym aýtmak hiç zat däl.
It was good to be home.	Öýde bolmak gowy boldy.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
In fact, this has been the case for some time.	Aslynda birneme wagt bäri şeýle boldy.
I'm not completely happy	Men doly bagtly däl
I still think that's right.	Men henizem dogry diýip pikir edýärin.
I knew he would be there	Men onuň şol ýerde boljakdygyny bilýärdim
I didn’t know anyone else who could help me	Maňa kömek edip biljek başga birini bilmeýärdim
I couldn't be that person anymore	Indi ol adam bolup bilmedim
I didn't get much	Men kän zat alyp bilmedim
It was new to me.	Bu meniň üçin täze boldy.
I couldn't do that	Men beýle zady edip bilmedim
It can never happen.	Hiç haçan bolup bilmez.
Not complete and certainly not the only one.	Doly däl we elbetde diňe däl.
There is no way to report this.	Bu barada habar bermek üçin hiç hili ýol ýok.
I'd like to see it.	Men ony görmek isleýärin.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
It went faster.	Ol has çalt gitdi.
He did it fast.	Çalt etdi.
This is good news.	Bu gowy habar.
I loved it.	Gaty gowy gördüm.
It's ready to go.	Bu gitmäge taýyn.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
Here and now.	Bu ýerde we häzir.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
Can you tell me how to do this?	Muny nädip etmelidigini aýdyp bilersiňizmi?
I was with them	Men olar bilen bile boldum
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
Everything is still in place.	Hemme zat henizem bir ýerde.
I know it's not new	Men onuň täze däldigini bilýärin
He wants to.	Ol isleýär.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
I just didn't need it	Maňa diňe gerek däldi
He does the same.	Ol hem edil şonuň ýaly edýär.
I can't go back for just one job	Diňe bir iş üçin gaýdyp bilemok
I think he will actually do that.	Meniň pikirimçe, aslynda şeýle eder.
It's like you.	Bu seniň ýaly.
It's just bad.	Bu diňe erbet.
Even beautiful.	Hatda owadan.
I told her I needed help.	Men oňa kömek etmelidigini aýtdym.
You know that.	Muny gowy bilýärsiň.
Happy day	Bagtly gün.
He did it himself.	Muny özi etdi.
I have to go with that	Men munuň bilen gitmeli
I told you.	Men saňa aýtdym.
We are not.	Biz beýle däl.
I can sing a little.	Biraz aýdym aýdyp bilerin.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
In fact, it was with us.	Aslynda bu biziň bilen boldy.
Who does that.	Kim muny edýär.
This is for you	Bu seniň üçin
I don't think so.	Bu näme bolýar öýdemok.
I tried to please you	Men seni razy etjek boldum
It can be fun to try.	Synap görmek gyzykly bolup biler.
I thought last night	Düýn agşam pikir etdim
Only one remained.	Diňe biri galdy.
Once a very smart man told me	Bir gezek gaty akylly adam maňa aýtdy
I tried again last night	Düýn agşam ýene synap gördüm
I was one a few years ago	Birnäçe ýyl mundan ozal bir boldum
The strangest thing.	Iň geň zat.
We have to do this to help us.	Bize kömek etmek üçin muny etmeli.
I did it for him	Men muny oňa etdim
How good is this	Bu nähili gowy?
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe oňa rugsat bermeli.
I can give you a job	Men size iş berip bilerin
He does it all.	Ol düýbünden edýär.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, şeýle.
That's a good question	Bu ýerde gaty gowy sorag
No money.	Pul ýok.
I need you	Men saňa gerek
He was surprised to see me.	Ol meni görüp geň galdy.
Closer.	Has ýakyn.
Big mistake.	Uly ýalňyşlyk.
They are there.	Olar şol ýerde.
I'm already busy	Men eýýäm meşgul boldum
Not a bad thing.	Erbet zat däl.
This is the clearest thing.	Bu iň aýdyň zat.
I will be with them	Men olar bilen bile bolaryn
That's what happened.	Şeýle boldy.
No one here wants to help.	Bu ýerde hiç kim kömek etmek islemeýär.
Okay.	Bolýar.
And then.	Soň bolsa.
I didn't mean to offend you	Bu zady saňa etmek islemedim
It would also be easy.	Şeýle hem aňsat bolardy.
Whoever wanted to say everything, absolutely everything.	Kim hemme zady, düýbünden hemme zady aýtmak isledi.
I know what to do	Näme etmelidigini bilýärin
Now I have to tell you.	Indi saňa aýtmaly.
This is the reality of life.	Bu durmuş hakykaty.
This is very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal.
He is still here.	Ol henizem şu ýerde.
You have to promise me.	Sen maňa söz bermeli.
These things.	Bu zatlar.
He probably needs someone.	Oňa kim gerek bolsa gerek.
Not a bad idea.	Erbet pikir däl.
I just have to go	Men diňe gitmeli
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
Help is easier.	Kömek has aňsat.
It has been around for some time	Birnäçe wagt bäri bar
He gave it.	Ol muny berdi.
The last thing you want.	Iň soňky isleýän zady.
I found it easy	Munuň aňsat bolandygyny gördüm
I need time alone	Maňa ýeke wagt gerek
There	Şol ýerde.
That shouldn't be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däl.
I was not ready for you.	Men saňa taýyn däldim.
I have to rest.	Men dynç almaly.
He did.	Ol şeýle etdi.
He went there.	Ol şol ýere gitdi.
At present, this has not been possible.	Häzirki wagtda bu has dogry bolup bilmedi.
He was not ready for that.	Ol muňa taýyn däldi.
I know it does	Munuň maňa edýändigini bilýärin
I just didn’t see it	Men muny diňe görmedim
I could have called him, but he couldn't	Men oňa jaň edip bilýärdim, ýöne ol maňa jaň edip bilmedi
He was late.	Ol gijä galdy.
I'm not crazy yet	Men entek däli däldim
You have to rest.	Dynç almaly.
He didn't have much money.	Kän pul ýokdy.
It always has been and always will be.	Hemişe boldy we hemişe bolar.
Something was wrong here.	Bu ýerde bir zat dogry däldi.
I could not tell the truth	Dogry aýdyp bilmedim
I have to go to this school	Men bu mekdebe gitmeli
I fully believe that.	Men muňa doly ynanýaryn.
Not just us.	Diňe biz däl.
One day, one thing, another.	Bir gün bir zat, başga bir zat başga.
', and it happens.'	', we bolýar'.
I bought more books yesterday	Düýn has köp kitap satyn aldym
Something wonderful about you and me.	Seniň we meniň ýaly ajaýyp bir zat.
It is impossible to answer.	Jogap bermek mümkin däl.
Bad, we really need it.	Erbet, bize hakykatdanam zerur.
I have to do this alone	Muny ýeke özüm etmeli
He likes it.	Ol muny halaýar.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
There is giving, there is receiving.	Bermek bar, almak hem bar.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
This is also very good.	Bu hem gaty gowy.
Once upon a time I got very good advice.	Bir gezek gaty gowy maslahat aldym.
Dinner time.	Nahar wagty.
I wondered what he was doing.	Men onuň näme edýändigini pikir etdim.
I'm really big	Men hakykatdanam uly
He will agree.	Ol razy bolar.
No questions asked.	Sorag ýok.
I didn't even see it	Men hatda ony görmedim
Not surprisingly.	Geň däl.
I never thought	Men asla pikir etmedim
I want to do something good	Gowy bir zat etmek isleýärin
I can do something for you	Men seniň üçin bir zat edip bilerin
She is not happy.	Ol bagtly däl.
Until next week !.	Geljek hepde çenli !.
This is probably not the case.	Bu hatda dogry däl bolsa gerek.
He doesn't know it yet.	Ol entek muny bilenok.
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
Of course not.	Elbetde hökman däldi.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
He can't do anything.	Ol hiç zat edip bilmeýär.
I confessed everything	Men hemme zady boýun aldym
So it's easier to see.	Şonuň üçin görmek has aňsat.
I can't rest	Dynç alyp bilemok
I saw something strange	Geň bir zat gördüm
I told you so much	Men saňa gaty köp zat aýtdym
Everything is fine now.	Häzir hemme zat gowy.
Like a man.	Adam ýaly.
It only took a few times.	Diňe birnäçe gezek gerek boldy.
I can say those things	Men ol zatlary aýdyp bilerin
There was more.	Has köp zat bardy.
Who knows what he's thinking.	Kim näme pikir edýändigini bilýär.
I should know.	Men bilýän bolmaly.
That would have been the case a few months ago	Birnäçe aý mundan ozal şeýle bolardy
He did it for me.	Bu meniň üçin etdi.
He was like me.	Ol meniň ýalydy.
He never had to tell her, because he knew	Oňa hiç haçan aýtmak hökman däldi, sebäbi ol bilýärdi
I thought it was great	Gaty gowy geldi öýdüpdim
The police know that.	Polisiýa muny bilýär.
I didn't do anything like that	Men onuň ýaly zady etmedim
I was not there.	Men ol ýerde däldim.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
What happened to him?	Oňa näme boldy?
I don't think so.	Hakykatdanam beýle bolmaz diýip pikir etmeýärin.
A madman	Bir däli.
I want you with everything	Men seni hemme zat bilen isleýärin
It could be something very big.	Gaty uly bir zat bolup biler.
I have to do this one day	Men muny bir gün etmeli
There are a lot of things to do.	Etmeli birneme köp zat bar.
Life is good now.	Durmuş häzir gowy.

Not just fun.	Diňe gyzykly däl.
Every path is just wonderful.	Her bir ýol diňe ajaýyp.
I couldn't help it.	Men oňa kömek edip bilmedim.
There is only one problem.	Diňe bir mesele bar.
And with them.	We olar bilen.
The message is coming	Habar gelýär
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Dogry bolmak gaty gowy zat.
There is no such thing everywhere.	Hemme ýerde beýle zat ýok.
I had fun last night	Düýn agşam hezil etdim
Maybe this will help.	Belki bu kömek eder.
I can't think of it with anyone else	Men ony başga biri bilen pikir edip bilemok
I have a lot.	Mende köp zat bar.
This also seems to be true.	Bu hem dogry ýaly bolup görünýär.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu şeýle bolmaly.
Such a thing would not be right.	Munuň ýaly zat dogry bolmaz.
I could not go to school	Men mekdebe baryp bilmedim
She seemed happy.	Ol bagtly ýalydy.
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
Difficult, but not impossible.	Kyn, ýöne mümkin däl.
It's been a long time.	Köp wagt boldy.
You are right.	Siz dogry.
I don't know what happened to him	Oňa näme bolandygyny bilemok
It's been a long time.	Köp boldy.

It's more beautiful.	Has ajaýyp.
Here it is now.	Ine, häzir.
Not good or bad.	Gowy ýa-da erbet däl.
I will always be early	Men elmydama ir bolaryn
Not against it.	Muňa garşy däl.
I do not believe so.	Men beýle ynanamok.
Whether he knows it himself or not is another matter.	Muny özi bilýärmi ýa-da başga mesele.
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
It was good to say that.	Muny aýtmak gowy boldy.
This was not the case at all.	Bu asla beýle däldi.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
That's the way it is today.	Bu gün şeýle boldy.
I had a day off	Bir gün dynç aldym
Here's another one.	Ine, başga biri.
Very interesting guy.	Gaty gyzykly ýigit.
I don't want anyone to do that	Muny hiç kime islämok
There was nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde geň zat ýokdy.
Ol.	Ol.
I think this is something else for me	Bu meniň üçin başga bir zat diýip pikir edýärin
It's very difficult to do that.	Muny etmek gaty kyn.
The reason for this is not enough.	Munuň sebäbi ýeterlik däl.
I think you should go	Sen gitmeli öýdýän
This can take a few days or longer.	Bu birnäçe gün ýa-da has köp wagt alyp biler.
Not like him.	Özi ýaly däl.
The girl does.	Gyz edýär.
I'm so scared	Özümi gaty gorkýaryn
She is wonderful.	Ol ajaýyp.
In fact, he had a great time.	Aslynda onuň ajaýyp wagty bardy.
I didn't need a song right now	Maňa şu wagt aýdym gerek däldi
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
I've seen it a lot.	Men muny gaty köp gördüm.
You will be wonderful for that.	Munuň üçin ajaýyp bolarsyňyz.
The answer came almost immediately	Jogap derrew diýen ýaly gaýdyp geldi
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
I haven't seen anything yet	Men henizem bir zady görüp bilmedim
It was not time for work.	Iş üçin wagt däldi.
Where is he	Ol nirede?
Maybe he can do it now.	Belki, indi edip biler.
Maximum months.	Iň köp aý.
Maybe it can go somewhere.	Belki, bu bir ýere gidip biler.
It will take time and time.	Wagt we wagt gerek bolar.
You don't have to do anything.	Hiç zat etmeli däl.
This meal was just good.	Bu nahar diňe gowy boldy.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýok.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
I am alone	Men ýeke.

The worst thing that could happen is.	Bolup biljek iň erbet zat.
He can do more.	Ol has köp zady edip biler.
I think life is good	Durmuş gowy diýip pikir edýärin
I do not.	Men ýok.

You have no good news yet	Size entek gowy habar ýok
As before.	Öňküsi ýaly.
In fact, it was not.	Aslynda beýle däldi.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
He can talk.	Ol gürläp biler.
I really didn't know.	Men hakykatdanam bilmedim.
I haven't seen anything like this in years	Köp ýyl bäri beýle zady görmedim
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
I thought who did that	Kim muny etdi diýip pikir etdim
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ol ýerde beýle ajaýyp zat ýok.
No way.	Hiç hili ýok.
I only had one question.	Mende diňe bir sorag bardy.
This year has been a wonderful year	Bu ýyl ajaýyp ýyl boldy
Nothing will happen to you here.	Bu ýerde size hiç zat bolmaz.
he thinks.	diýip pikir edýär.
Of course it should be.	Elbetde, hökman şeýle bolmaly.
I may be here for another two weeks	Men bu ýerde ýene iki hepde bolup bilerin
Not necessarily like us.	Hökman biziň ýaly däl.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
I haven't been like this in a while.	Birnäçe wagt bäri beýle däldim.
I think it exists now	Meniň pikirimçe, ol häzir bar
No questions asked.	Sorag ýok.
Maybe that's the way it is.	Belki, bu hem şeýle.
You know what he wants.	Onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärsiň.
There is no question about them anymore.	Indi olar hakda sorag ýok.
I don't think you're right	Meniň pikirimçe, sen dogry däl
He can do that.	Ol muny edip biler.
Not just a guy.	Diňe bir ýigit däl.
I can't just be with you	Men diňe siziň bilen bolup bilemok
I think that's good news.	Bu gowy habar diýip pikir edýärin.
The two of us.	Ikimiz.
He said nothing.	Ol hiç zat däl diýdi.
I'm still good.	Men entek gowy zat.
In fact, he didn't even know it.	Aslynda, muny özi hem bilmeýärdi.
Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
I thought it would be here	Men şu ýerde bolar öýdüpdim
I didn't know it existed	Men onuň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
I can't do anything for you today	Bu gün seniň üçin hiç zat edip bilemok
That's what happened.	Ol şeýle boldy.
I did it	Men muny etdim
Good news.	Gowy habar.
I will not have such a life	Mende beýle durmuş bolmaz
Then came another thought.	Soň oňa başga bir pikir geldi.
About time.	Wagt hakda.
No one could.	Hiç kim edip bilmedi.
I borrowed it at night	Men ony gije karz aldym
No one should have said that.	Hiç kim muny aýtmaly däldi.
That would be great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp bolardy.
I know.	Men bilýärin.
I just didn’t think about it	Diňe bu hakda pikir etmedim
Maybe that would be enough.	Belki, bu ýeterlik bolardy.
Only.	Diňe.
It should be like this from now on.	Mundan beýläk şeýle bolmaly.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
He was still there.	Ol henizem bardy.
Who else could it be.	Başga kim bolup biler.
I didn't really think so	Aslynda beýle pikir etmedim
I was not there and no one told me much	Men ol ýerde däldim we hiç kim maňa kän zat aýtmady
That's exactly what happens.	Edil şeýle bolýar.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
I was about to call you today	Şu gün saňa jaň etjek boldum
We have to be together.	Biz bilelikde bolmaly.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim
It was great.	Gaty gowy boldy.
This is good for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy.
It was as if nothing had happened.	Hiç zat ýok ýalydy.
He decided.	Ol karar berdi.
I have always told you the truth	Men size hemişe hakykaty aýtdym
Not even about it.	Bu hakda hatda däl.
I thought it was the top three	Iň köp üç diýip pikir etdim
I can try there	Men ol ýerde synap görüp bilerin
I can get this very easily	Men muny gaty aňsat alyp bilerin
Something happened to him.	Oňa bir zat boldy.
There is a good reason for this	Munuň üçin gowy sebäp bar
It will be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolar.
One job every year.	Her ýyl bir iş.
There is a lot there.	Ol ýerde köp zat bar.
Not the most interesting.	Iň gyzykly däl.
There is no time for that.	Munuň üçin wagty ýok.
I know he did	Men muny edenini bilýärin
I can be honest.	Dogry aýdyp bilerin.
Not much.	Kän däl.
I took it and gave it to him	Men ony alyp, oňa berdim
I want everything now	Men häzir hemme zady isleýärin
I really did	Men hakykatdanam etdim
It's easy to do that.	Muny etmek aňsat.
It seems to have done well.	Gowy eden ýaly.
I agree with that, it’s great for me	Men muňa razy boldum, ol meniň üçin ajaýyp
Not often, but there is a possibility.	Köplenç däl, ýöne mümkinçilik bar.

And then there you are.	Soň bolsa sen bar.
There may be more.	Has köp bolmagy mümkin.
I don't think so.	Men pikirimçe beýle däl.
Of course, I'm happy about that	Elbetde, men muňa begenýärin
I could not speak	Men gürläp bilmedim
I think it already existed	Meniň pikirimçe, öňem bardy
It seemed like the right thing to do	Onuň üçin dogry zat ýalydy
That sounds great.	Bu gaty gowy ýaly.
Something about that.	Bu barada bir zat.
I couldn't take it anymore	Indi alyp bilmedim
This is really strange.	Bu hakykatdanam geň görünýär.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
Not this time or here.	Bu gezek ýa-da bu ýerde däl.
An opportunity to talk to a beautiful girl	Owadan gyz bilen gürleşmek üçin mümkinçilik
I wonder who this could be	Munuň kim bolup biljekdigine haýran
I didn't mean to offend you	Men hiç zat aýtmak islemedim
I need an answer.	Maňa jogap gerek.
I still didn't want to go with him	Men entek onuň bilen gitmek islemedim
And it will never happen.	We asla beýle bolmaz.
I knew you had more	Saňa has köp zadyň bardygyny bilýärdim
I told him the truth	Men oňa hakykaty aýtdym
I may already have it	Mende eýýäm bar bolmagy mümkin
This is not for everyone, but here it is.	Bu hemmeler üçin däl, ýöne ine şu.
I want to talk to him again	Men onuň bilen ýene gürleşmek isleýärin
I didn't see it that way	Men muny beýle görmedim
Of course I do.	Elbetde edýärin.
They must have done something.	Olar bir zatlar eden bolmaly.
It already existed.	Bu öňem bardy.
Not many people know that.	Köp adam muny bilmeýär.
That would be nice.	Bu gowy bolardy.
That man was not stupid.	Ol adam samsyk däldi.
He said something good about me.	Ol meniň hakda bir gowy zat aýtdy.
There is more here.	Bu ýerde has köp zat bar.
That's it.	Bu şol.
Of course, he didn't have to do that.	Elbetde, muny etmeli däldi.
No one was there that night.	Şol gije hiç kim ýokdy.
It was good with us.	Bu biziň bilen gowy boldy.
no	ýok.
It was not necessary to see him again	Ony ýene görmek hökman däldi
I hope this helps!	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin!
It turned out well.	Gowy çykdy.
I know	Men bilýärin
This is a big decision.	Bu uly karar.
I never knew what had happened	Näme bolandygyny hiç wagt bilmedim
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Oh, he really did.	Aý, hakykatdanam şeýle etdi.
It's hard for me.	Bu meniň üçin kyn.
It was for me.	Bu meniň üçin boldy.
I didn't think so.	Men muňa pikir etmedim.
It was possible to answer a few.	Birnäçe jogap bermek mümkin boldy.
This is difficult.	Bu kyn.
I can't speak.	Men gürläp bilemok.
It could not be.	Ol bolup bilmedi.
Now everything is different.	Häzir hemme zat başga.
He said something else.	Bu başga bir zat diýdi.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
Not many questions.	Kän sorag däl.
He did nothing wrong.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedi.
I did not object	Meniň özüm garşy däldim
One two three.	Bir iki üç.
I'm not going to do that.	Men muny etjek däl.
It was good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy boldy.
No one thought about it because it was not an issue.	Hiç kim bu barada pikir etmedi, sebäbi bu mesele däldi.
At the same time	Şol bir wagtda.
It will definitely be.	Bu düýbünden bolar.
He said this himself.	Muny özi aýtdy.
I don't think I'll be happy.	Men bagtly bolaryn öýdemok.
Faster.	Has çalt.
You are here.	Sen şu ýerde.
This was not the case.	Munuň ýaly zat beýle däldi.
Now something else.	Indi başga zat.
In this house, he is here.	Bu öýde, ol şu ýerde.
There is a month	Bir aý bar
He immediately said no.	Ol derrew ýok diýdi.
It was great.	Gaty gowy boldy.
It makes one thing clear.	Bu bir zady aýdyň aýdýar.
This is not much.	Bu kän zat däl.
What will he do?	Ol näme eder?
I need something new	Maňa täze bir zat gerek
This is not new.	Bu täze däl.
There is a good reason to worry.	Alada etmegiň gowy sebäbi bar.
He wants a little more.	Biraz köp zat isleýär.
A week or two can be.	Bir hepde, iki bolup biler.
I think everything should be fine	Meniň pikirimçe hemme zat gowy bolmaly
I tried it myself.	Özüm synap gördüm.
I can't believe he really will be mine	Men onuň hakykatdanam meniň boljakdygyna ynanamok
I think it's about time	Wagt hakda boldy öýdýän
That day is not over yet.	Şol gün entek gelenok.
I had no such thing	Mende beýle zat ýokdy
I haven't seen anything yet	Men entek hiç zat görmedim
Not in a place like this.	Munuň ýaly ýerde däl.
Oh, that's great.	Aý, bu gaty gowy.
This is not a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat däl.
Of course for you and me.	Elbetde, sen we meniň üçin.
There was no one else there.	Ol ýerde başga hiç kim ýokdy.
You can do that	Muny edip bilersiňiz
I hope this helps you.	Bu size kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
It did.	Bu etdi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Indi geldi.
You are not enough	Siz ýeterlik däl
Not good.	Gowy däl.
I think he needs it	Meniň pikirimçe, oňa mätäç
Really good	Hakykatdanam gaty gowy
He was just like me.	Ol edil meniň ýalydy.
Something else can happen.	Başga bir zat bolup biler.
The problem was still there.	Mesele henizem bardy.
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
You can go back to work or school.	Işe ýa-da mekdebe gaýdyp bilersiňiz.
It doesn't make me happy.	Bu meni bagtly etmeýär.
Then something happened to me.	Soň maňa bir zat geldi.
That was not the case.	Bu beýle zat däldi.
I can't rest	Men dynç alyp bilemok
I don't want to worry	Meni biynjalyk etmek islämok
She was worried.	Ony biynjalyk etdi.
The worst.	Iň erbet.
Please this time.	Bu gezek haýyş edýärin.
This is not possible	Bu mümkin däl
It would be nice if someone agreed with me.	Kimdir biri meniň bilen razy bolsa gowy boldy.
I don't know if he can do it	Edip biljekdigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilemok
I just had to say it	Men muny diňe aýtmaly boldum
Of course not.	Elbetde ýok.
I knew it was going to be a big deal	Munuň uly bir zat boljakdygyny bilýärdim
He just wanted to see her.	Ol diňe ony görmek isledi.
There was no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi hem ýokdy.
I saw this last week.	Men muny geçen hepde gördüm.
I tried and gave it a try once	Bir gezek synap gördüm we berdim
I didn't want to do that, but it did.	Men muny islemedim, ýöne şeýle boldy.
So if a lot of this is true.	Şonuň üçin bu köp zat dogry bolsa.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Today was the worst day.	Bu gün iň erbet gün boldy.
I told him he was not crazy	Men oňa däli däldigini aýtdym
There was a lot of work to be done.	Bu ýerde gaty köp iş bardy.
There is always a reason.	Elmydama bir sebäp bar.
It should be the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly bolmaly.
She began to worry.	Ol alada edip başlady.
This is exactly the style of governing the country that he has used in Russia.	Munuň ýaly hakykatdanam diňe köplenç bolýar.
It's a long way off and it will take you a while.	Bu gaty uzak ýol we size birnäçe wagt gerek bolar.
I was not in the right place	Dogry ýerde däldim
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly zat.
I told you so.	Men saňa aýdyp berdim.
I think that could be the problem.	Bu mesele bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
I had it this morning.	Mende şu gün irden bardy.
There is more.	Has köp zat bar.
No one is the same as the next one.	Hiç kim edil indiki ýaly däl.
This is something else.	Bu başga zat.
I'm happy about that.	Men muňa begenýärin.
He had to do something.	Ol bir zatlar etmeli boldy.
I reported this	Men muny habar berdim
You can also see.	Şeýle hem görüp bilersiňiz.
It's as if no one really knows.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam bilmeýän ýaly.
He is alone.	Ol ýeke.
There is no such thing now.	Häzir beýle zat ýok.
He gave it to you.	Ol saňa berdi.
Then he can call me.	Soň meni jaň edip biler.
You don't have to worry about those things.	Şol zatlar hakda alada etmeli bolmaz.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
It seemed very right at the time.	Şol wagt gaty dogry ýalydy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I didn't know what had happened	Näme bolandygyny bilmedim
Now tell me what happened.	Indi näme bolandygyny aýdyň.
This is stupid too.	Bu hem samsyk.
There is no question about that.	Bu barada hiç hili sorag ýok.
You know	Bilýärsiň.
I think it is clear here and now	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýerde we şu wagt aýdyň görünýär
I called him, and he answered	Men oňa jaň etdim, ol bolsa jogap berdi
I was not very good about it	Men bu hakda gaty gowy däldim
You must be aware that this is not the case	Munuň beýle däldigini bilýän bolmaly
Maybe in the morning.	Belki, irden bolar.
I need something else	Maňa başga zat gerek
In fact, they are.	Hakykatdanam, olar.
I need some advice from you	Maňa senden bir maslahat gerek
You can see me	Meni görüp bilersiňiz
I never did that to him	Men oňa hiç wagt beýle zat etmedim
Of course, this is the right decision.	Elbetde, bu dogry karar.
Not immediately.	Derrew däl.
You may be right	Dogry aýdyp bilersiňiz
Often this is not the case.	Köplenç bu mesele däl.
Beautiful.	Owadan.
We need help.	Bize kömek gerek.
This will no longer be the case.	Bu indi beýle bolmaz.
I'm doing the right thing here	Men bu ýerde dogry zady edýärin
I just want to be there for you	Men diňe siziň üçin şol ýerde bolmak isleýärin
To be necessary	Zerur bolmak.
You have to be there now.	Häzir ol ýerde bolmaly.
There will be time for such a word.	Şeýle söz üçin wagt bolar.
I don't know what he's doing there	Men onuň ol ýerde näme edýändigini bilemok
I just want an answer	Diňe bir jogap isleýärin
Of course he can't.	Elbetde, muny edip bilmeýär.
It should be given to him.	Bu oňa bermeli.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
This year they are.	Bu ýyl olar.
We can get it.	Biz alyp bileris.
I have	Mende bar.
Nothing about him.	Özi hakda hiç zat ýok.
I had to go with them	Men olar bilen gitmeli boldum
You have to do it the other way around.	Muny başga ýol bilen etmeli.
I think maybe	Mümkin diýip pikir edýärin
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
They exist now.	Olar häzir bar.
He gave way a little.	Biraz ýol berdi.
He did.	Ol şeýle etdi.
I'm not crazy or anything	Men däli ýa-da başga zat däl
At the time, no one thought about it.	Şol wagt hiç kim bu barada hiç zat pikir etmedi.
I never do that myself	Men muny hiç haçan özüm etmeýärin
He didn't have to say that.	Ol muny aýtmaly däldi.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
The girl, of course, knew what she wanted.	Gyz elbetde näme isleýändigini bilýärdi.
I was not alone here	Men bu ýerde ýeke däldim
In fact, this is a very serious matter.	Aslynda bu gaty bir zat.
This is only once.	Bu diňe bir gezek.
I think that's great	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy
There can only be one way.	Diňe bir ýol bolup biler.
I tried	Synap gördüm
Good day	Gowy gün.
I'll do the first thing tomorrow morning	Ertir irden ilkinji zady ederin
It takes time and it's not fun.	Munuň üçin wagt gerek we gyzykly däl.
I always think so	Elmydama şeýle bolar diýip pikir edýärin
That's when we were.	Ine, şol wagt biz.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
Not much here.	Bu ýerde kän däl.
Then another person.	Soň başga bir adam.
I was not going to help	Men kömek etjek däldim
I think we can be together	Bilelikde bolup bileris diýip pikir edýärin
I was not crazy	Men däli däldim
I did not object	Men muňa garşy däldim
I can't talk about a lot of people	Köp adam hakda aýdyp biljek däl
I still can't believe it	Men henizem ynanamok
There was nothing that anyone could do about it.	Hiç kimiň edip biljek zady ýokdy.
Where are you	Sen nirede?.
I can't have too much	Mende gaty köp zat bolup bilmez
This is very serious.	Bu gaty çynlakaý.
You are a big girl	Sen uly gyz
I can't do anything about it	Men bu barada hiç zat edip bilemok
And then he came back.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp geldi.
This was not what he wanted.	Bu onuň isleýän zady däldi.
It was never about money.	Bu hiç wagt pul hakda däldi.
He didn't want to.	Ol muny islemedi.
Just like them.	Edil olar ýaly.
He understood.	Ol düşündi.
That's what happened.	Hemmeler şeýle boldy.
Maybe it would be a good thing.	Belki gowy zat bolardy.
What will he do?	Ol näme eder.
It would be very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat bolardy.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat ajaýyp.
I don't believe it will ever happen.	Hiç haçan boljakdygyna ynanamok.
I was never like that before	Men ozal beýle däldim
This guy just thinks a lot about himself	Bu ýigit diňe özi hakda köp pikir edýär
Not many people knew that.	Muny köp adam bilmeýärdi.
Something will happen.	Bir zat bolar.
Adam.	Adam.
He said it was not.	Ol beýle däldigini aýtdy.
Loans are easier this year.	Karz bu ýyl has aňsat.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
I can't hurt her that much	Men oňa beýle zyýan berip bilemok
He does this in a number of ways.	Muny birnäçe ýol bilen edýär.
I did whatever I wanted, I did whatever I wanted	Islän zadyny etdim, islän wagty etdim
I know it all.	Muny hemmeler ýaly bilýärin.
I was there for two weeks	Men ol ýerde iki hepde boldum
There was something strange about it.	Bu ýerde geň bir zat bardy.
Then he fell asleep.	Soň bolsa uklap galdy.
Many times	Köp gezek.
I think he was surprised	Meniň pikirimçe, ol geň galdy
I was not really surprised	Men hakykatdanam geň görmedim
Because it must have happened.	Sebäbi ol hökman şeýle boldy.
I want to do this	Bu işi etmek isleýärin
I could not go to him	Men oňa baryp bilmedim
I think it would be better.	Has gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
He will help us.	Ol bize kömek eder.
It's different for you.	Bu siziň üçin başga.
I have never seen it so interesting	Hiç haçan beýle gyzykly görmedim
I can get you another one	Men saňa başga birini alyp bilerin
This idea, of course, was not new.	Bu pikir, elbetde, täze däldi.
Of course, he is right.	Elbetde, dogry aýdýar.
I haven't seen him in a few days	Birnäçe gün bäri ony görmedim
He did.	Ol şeýle etdi.
I told her everything	Men ol hakda hemme zady aýtdym
Not every summer.	Her tomus beýle däl.
I think tomorrow will be a good day	Ertir gowy gün bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I want to get this	Men muny almak isleýärin
I think he can do it this time	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gezek muny edip biler
We need this guy.	Bize bu ýigit gerek.
I hope it will be good	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
No one knows what it will be like.	Onuň nähili boljakdygyny hiç kim bilenok.
This time I could be.	Bu gezek men bolup bilerin.
I can't think of another way	Başga ýol hakda pikir edip bilemok
I can't do anything myself	Men özüm hiç zat edip bilemok
That's a lot.	Bu köp boldy.
Makes everything interesting.	Hemme zady gyzykly edýär.
Of course, this was not the case for me.	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin däldi.
You are not a thing, you are a man.	Siz bir zat däl, bir adam.
Really great idea.	Hakykatdanam ajaýyp pikir.
You have to call him and tell him.	Oňa jaň edip, aýtmaly.
He told me he didn't know.	Ol maňa bilmeýändigini aýtdy.
So it is.	Şonuň üçin şeýle bar.
I thought we could really do it.	Hakykatdanam edip bileris diýip pikir etdim.
I hoped it would	Elbetde bolar diýip umyt etdim
I only did this once.	Men muny diňe bir gezek etdim.
No decision to make or call.	Karar bermek ýa-da jaň etmek üçin karar ýok.
It was fun.	Bu hezil boldy.
I never thought it would happen	Munuň boljakdygyny asla pikir etmedim
I will never be good and it is not bad	Men hiç haçan gowy bolmaz we bu erbet däl
I couldn't sleep	Men uklap bilmedim
I want to give it to her	Men oňa bermek isleýärin
I have a quick question.	Mende çalt sorag bar.
It seems impossible to eliminate a problem	Bir meseläni ýok etmek mümkin däl ýaly
That alone was not the issue.	Munuň özi mesele däldi.
This was not the case	Bu beýle däldi
He doesn't know, and he never will.	Ol bilmeýär we asla bilmez.
I agree with that statement	Men bu söz bilen gaty razy
Not really that bad.	Aslynda gaty erbet däl.
It's morning.	Irden boldy.
It's really good, big.	Aslynda gaty gowy, uly.
Very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly.
This is absolutely crazy.	Bu düýbünden däli.
This is not new.	Bu täze däl.
This is a strange idea.	Bu geň pikir.
The first vote was three more.	Ilkinji ses ýene üç boldy.
To see it.	Ony görmek üçin.
I thought it came too fast.	Gaty çalt geldi öýdüpdim.
I called before	Men ozal jaň etdim
I will do this again	Muny ýene bir gezek ederin
I never wanted to hurt him	Men oňa hiç wagt zyýan bermek islemedim
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
I had to do it myself	Muny özüm etmeli boldum
He is not.	Ol däl.
Nothing serious yet.	Entek çynlakaý zat ýok.
For a while.	Birnäçe wagt bäri.
Just one thing.	Diňe bir zat.
I could not see me, but nowhere and everywhere	Meni görüp bilmedim, ýöne hiç ýerde we hemme ýerde
I really didn’t mind much	Men hakykatdanam kän bir garşy däldim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň bilen gowy zat.
He did a lot of things right.	Dogry hem köp zatlar etdi.
That could be bad.	Bu erbet bolup biler.
I really want to see	Hakykatdanam görmek isleýärin
It is also easier to be.	Şeýle hem bolmak has aňsat.

Everything.	Hemme zat.
I didn’t care about anything anymore	Indi hiç zat hakda alada etmedim
What would it be like.	Bu nähili bolardy.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
I have to do it right now.	Men edil şu wagt etmeli.

I trust you completely	Men saňa doly ynanýaryn
There was also a lot going on.	Şeýle hem, köp zat boldy.
That's right.	Dogry boldy.
This is what happened here.	Bu ýerde şu boldy.

Just a question of when and what to do.	Diňe haçan we haýsy iş hakda sorag.
I think she is happy.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol bagtly.
This is a bit strange for me.	Bu meniň üçin birneme geň.
Something was wrong.	Bir zat gaty dogry däldi.
That tells you something.	Bu size bir zat aýdýar.
It also helps.	Bu hem kömek edýär.
I did something for you	Men seniň üçin bir zat etdim
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
It has to be good for something.	Bir zat üçin gowy bolmaly.
He was not there to take me away.	Ol meni alyp gitmek üçin ýokdy.
I'll be worse tomorrow	Ertir has erbet bolaryn
He said he could do it.	Ol muny edip biljekdigini aýtdy.
He doesn't either.	Ol hem ýok.
I had to give it a go	Men muňa bermeli boldum
I know these things	Men bu zatlar hakda bilýärin
It takes a bit of work.	Biraz iş gerek.
It's crazy, but it's fun.	Bu däli, ýöne gaty gyzykly.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
It's kind of good.	Bu bir hili gowy.
This is a beautiful thing.	Bu owadan zat.
I can't tell you more	Men saňa has köp zat aýdyp biljek däl
I do the same thing every day	Her gün şol bir zady edýärin

Very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly.
I don't have to	Men hökman däl
And now the same thing could happen.	Indi bolsa edil şonuň ýaly bir zat bolup biler.
Not very good here.	Bu ýerde gaty gowy däl.

And then it happened	Soň bolsa şeýle boldy
There is no other word for this.	Munuň üçin başga söz ýok.
I never questioned that	Men muny hiç haçan sorag etmedim
I have a lot of fun.	Men gaty hezil edýärin.
It could be the same.	Şeýle hem bolup biler.
We are not ready for that.	Biz munuň üçin taýyn däl.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
I was not ready to do that again	Men muny ýene etmäge taýyn däldim
A little bit about that.	Bu barada birneme.
I think it will be interesting	Gyzykly bolar öýdýän
I really don't know anything about that.	Men hakykatdanam bu barada hiç zat bilemok.
It will not be so.	Şeýle bolmaz.
He is a really good man.	Hakykatdanam gowy adam.
I didn't do that	Men muny etmedim
I'm fine with that.	Men muňa gowy.
I didn't want to hope	Umyt etmek islemedim

He said he did so a month ago	Bir aý öň şeýle edendigini aýtdy
Of course it should be.	Elbetde, şeýle bolmaly.
It's hard to see.	Ony görmek kyn.
I think you'll have to do it tonight.	Şu gije etmeli bolarsyňyz öýdýän.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
I don't want that	Men muny islämok
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
For a while, no one was there.	Birnäçe wagt bäri ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
Of course, there was already.	Elbetde, öňem bardy.
You can tell me.	Maňa aýdyp bilersiňiz.
It doesn't seem like tomorrow.	Ertir ýok ýaly.
I have to say something about that.	Bu hakda bir zat aýtmaly.
I could not speak.	Men gürläp bilmedim.
This is very interesting and a big challenge.	Bu gaty gyzykly we uly kynçylyk.
In fact, there is a lot of money right now.	Aslynda häzirki wagtda gaty köp pul bar.
I think that's for sure	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hökman
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
He said it again.	Ol muny ýene aýtdy.
More next week.	Geljek hepde has köp.
It was even more fun.	Bu has gyzykly boldy.
I will not be the last	Men iň soňky bolmaz
He can help us.	Ol bize kömek edip biler.
I was not ready to do that, of course not with him	Men muny etmäge taýyn däldim, elbetde onuň bilen däl
That man is stupid.	Ol adam samsyk.
I got things	Men zatlary aldym
I was so scared that day	Men şol gün gaty gorkýaryn
It was not easy to decide.	Karar bermek aňsat däldi.
I had never thought of that before	Bu hakda öňem pikir etmedim
We have more now.	Biz häzir has köp.
This is also a lie	Bu hem ýalan
I always know that	Men bu hakda elmydama bilýärin
It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
That's why he's here.	Munuň üçin ol şu ýerde.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
Three, two, one.	Üç, iki, bir.
Which is true, you can do.	Haýsy dogry, edip bilersiňiz.
I'm older now.	Men häzir has uly adam.
I don't need that	Maňa bu zat gerek däl
It will be difficult.	Kyn bolar.
Of course he knew.	Elbetde, ol bilýärdi.
I only need two days	Maňa diňe iki gün gerek
It's not just me.	Bu diňe men däl.
The reason is clear.	Munuň sebäbi aýdyň.
Somewhere	Bir ýerde.
No more.	Indi ýok.
It looks stupid.	Bu samsyk ýaly görünýär.
He doesn't know you.	Ol seni bilmeýär.
I will do everything.	Men hemme zady ederin.
Tell us something.	Bize bir zat aýtmak.
I can't take that time	Men ol wagty alyp bilemok
It doesn't seem to be.	Aslynda ýok ýaly.
Of course it was.	Elbetde şeýle boldy.
Only this guy was not as happy as you.	Diňe bu ýigit siziň ýaly bagtly däldi.
He wants to please you.	Seni razy etmek isleýär.
I have already tried	Men eýýäm synap gördüm
I think he was worried	Meniň pikirimçe, ol alada galdy
Not interesting.	Gyzykly zat däl.
He was not always.	Ol hemişe däldi.
Where is he?	Ol nirede?.
I'll have to arrest someone.	Men birini tussag etmeli bolaryn.
I'm not the only one.	Men diňe şol adam däldim.
I hope it doesn't, but who knows	Bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin, ýöne kim bilýär
This is a bit true.	Bu birneme dogry.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I made myself so stupid	Özümi şeýle samsyk etdim
She is beautiful.	Ol owadan.
I became such a person	Men şeýle adam boldum
Then the only question is.	Soň ýekeje sorag şu.
You don't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däl.
They were not.	Olar beýle däldi.
I'm not against it.	Men muňa garşy däl.
No one told him.	Hiç kim oňa aýtmady.
You have to help him.	Oňa kömek etmeli.
It was as if no one was home.	Öýde hiç kim ýok ýalydy.
I knew it right now	Men muny şu wagt bilýärdim
I think this is a mistake	Bu ýalňyşlyk diýip pikir edýärin
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
I had to help.	Kömek etmeli boldum.
Not too many people.	Gaty köp adam däl.
He wants to talk to you about it.	Ol bu hakda siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýär.
Here's how you do	Ine, sen nähili
Three other people came out.	Başga üç adam çykdy.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
This is certainly a good question.	Bu, elbetde gowy sorag.
Not a bad person.	Erbet adam däl.
I didn't want to give myself up	Özümi bermek islemedim
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
I can't say that anymore	Indi muny aýdyp biljek däl
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
I didn't mean to offend you	Men muny gaty ses bilen aýtmak islemedim
I was	Men boldum.
It was good with him.	Bu onuň bilen gowy boldy.
I care about him a lot	Men oňa gaty alada edýärin
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu pikir etmek gowy zat.
Nothing more.	Mundan başga hiç zat ýok.
I think that's very likely.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty ähtimal.
This is good, very good.	Bu gowy, gaty gowy.
I have yet to see who did it	Kimiň muny edenini henizem görmedim
He cannot be a happy man.	Ol bagtly adam bolup bilmez.
It will be something.	Bu bir zat bolar.
I did.	Men etdim.
Maybe you just have to relax.	Belki diňe dynç almaly.
I can't think of anything	Men hemme zady pikir edip bilemok
I need you enough	Men saňa ýeterlik bolmaly
I think it will be good	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gowy bolar
It looks really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy görünýär.
I had nothing.	Mende hiç zat ýokdy.
I will be here with you.	Men şu ýerde seniň bilen bolaryn.
Just one thing.	Diňe bir zat.
He decided that what he needed was a little fun.	Oňa zerur zat birneme hezil boldy, diýip karar berdi.
It seemed possible.	Bu mümkin ýalydy.
The next thing.	Indiki zat.
It's been a while.	Birnäçe boldy.
I really think so	Hakykatdanam şeýle eder öýdýärin
He said.	Diýdi.
It was new to me.	Bu meniň üçin täze boldy.
This is not necessary.	Bu zerur däl.
No one paid much attention to me.	Hiç kim maňa beýle kän üns bermedi.
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
I can't tell you much about it	Bu hakda size köp zat aýdyp biljek däl
I am no more.	Men indi däl.
Does it really exist ???.	Hakykatdanam barmy ???.
It just didn't seem right.	Diňe dogry ýaly däldi.
He knew he would never do it.	Hiç haçan etmejekdigini bilýärdi.
I've been with him for a while.	Men onuň bilen biraz wagt boldum.
I often think about it	Men köplenç ol hakda pikir edýärin
I couldn't think of anything else	Başga zat hakda pikir edip bilmedim
Together and happy	Bile we bagtly.
He wanted to be alone.	Ol ýeke bolmak isledi.
Of course there was.	Elbetde bardy.
You know he does.	Etjekdigini bilýärsiň.
I think it looks good.	Gowy görünýär öýdýän.
I'm not a very good person.	Men hakykatdanam gaty gowy adam däl.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
It had to help.	Bu kömek etmeli boldy.
I think it could be better.	Has gowy zat bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
What is this	Bu näme?
It will be bad.	Bu erbet bolar.
I don’t know why anyone wants this job.	Hiç kimiň bu işi näme üçin isleýändigini bilemok.
He said it was not.	Ol beýle däldigini aýtdy.
I think he even knew what was going to happen.	Meniň pikirimçe, hatda näme boljakdygyny bilýärdi.
I need more help, and you can help me	Maňa has köp kömek gerek, siz bolsa maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz
This is not what I want.	Bu meniň isleýän zadym däl.
I could not allow it	Men muny etmäge rugsat berip bilmedim
As beautiful as you are.	Özüňiz ýaly ajaýyp.
This is not a guy.	Bu bir ýigit däl.
He thought I could do that	Muny edip bilerin diýip pikir etdi
I am not.	Men beýle däl.
So there will be no lies, not really and.	Şonuň üçin ýalan bolmaz, hakykatdanam däl we.
Of course he can.	Elbetde muny edip biler.
I never saw him	Men ony hiç wagt görmedim
Thinking about harming him.	Oňa zyýan bermek hakda pikir etmek.
He was completely insane.	Ol düýbünden däli boldy.
Easy to see.	Görmek aňsat.
I don’t know if that actually exists or not.	Aslynda munuň bardygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny bilemok.
This is the only way.	Bu diňe bir ýol.
I didn’t want to think about it right now	Men häzir bu hakda pikir etmek islemedim
I saw something else.	Başga bir zady gördüm.
I can't do it anymore	Indi edip bilemok
I have never seen such a thing	Men beýle zady görmedim
That makes me right now.	Bu meni häzir edýär.
I don't think that's a bad idea.	Bu erbet pikir däl diýip pikir edýärin.
That night	Şol gije.
I have to be really ready for work	Men hakykatdanam işe taýyn bolmaly
There are two things.	Iki zat bolýar.
In fact, this is not always the case.	Aslynda bu hemişe dogry däl.
I will not be here anymore.	Men mundan beýläk bolmaz.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat däldi.
He knows now.	Ol indi bilýär.
I had a strange idea.	Maňa geň bir pikir geldi.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
I can fully recommend it	Men oňa doly maslahat berip bilerin
I didn't see you there.	Men seni ol ýerde görmedim.
I'm with you here	Men seniň bilen şu ýerde
I always have, always will, always will	Men elmydama, hemişe bar, hemişe bolar
Nor will it be.	Şeýle hem bolmaz.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
In fact, it was not a lie.	Aslynda bu ýalan däldi.
I want to talk to you about it	Bu hakda size gürleşmek isleýärin
The book bothered him	Kitap ony biynjalyk etdi
You need to rest fast.	Çalt dynç almaly.
Tomorrow is tomorrow.	Ertir gün.
I don't think he should have gone	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gitmeli däldi
This is the right decision.	Bu dogry karar.
Thinking about something else.	Başga bir zat hakda pikir etmek.
I'm worried about him	Men ol hakda gaty alada edýärin
It would be really interesting to see that.	Muny görmek hakykatdanam gyzykly bolardy.
I didn't want to ask any more questions	Mundan başga sorag bermek islemedim
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
I didn't mean to offend you	Men saňa beýle erbet bolmak islemedim
I'm interested.	Men gyzykly.
It makes me happy.	Bu meni bagtly edýär.
I didn't even see it	Men ony hatda görmedim
He hoped so.	Ol şeýle umyt etdi.
I think he has already gone to work	Meniň pikirimçe, ol eýýäm işe gitdi
No words.	Hiç hili söz ýok.
Too many now.	Häzir gaty köp.
I was not so happy this month	Bu aý beýle bir bagtly däldim
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
Okay, good job.	Bolýar, gowy iş.
Nothing comes.	Hiç zat gelenok.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bu hakda hiç zat ýok.
That's right.	Dogry.
I thought it looked very difficult	Gaty kyn görünýär öýdüpdim
I did really badly	Men hakykatdanam erbet etdim
I loved it.	Gaty gowy gördüm.
There is a very good reason for this	Munuň gaty gowy sebäbi bar
He said, of course, something new.	Ol, elbetde, täze zat diýdi.
I need someone else, someone else.	Maňa başga, başga biri gerek.
He had to answer that.	Ol muňa jogap bermeli boldy.
He is now that guy.	Ol indi şol ýigit.
Here are two more people.	Ine, ýene iki adam.
Not today, not tomorrow, next week or next month.	Bu gün däl, ertir däl, indiki hepde ýa-da indiki aý.
Maybe you can tell.	Belki aýdyp bilersiňiz.
He is a good guy.	Ol gowy ýigit.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
He did.	Ol etdi.
I want to be there for him	Men onuň üçin şol ýerde bolmak isleýärin
It wasn't long.	Uzak däldi.
Not for a while	Birnäçe wagt bäri ýok
I've been with you all day	Men bütin gün seniň bilen boldum
I hope this will be good with you	Bu siziň bilen gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
I am for that too.	Men hem munuň üçin.
Not so happy.	Şeýle bagtly ýok.
He hadn't been noticed before.	Oňa öňem üns bermedi.
I destroyed everything for you	Men seniň üçin hemme zady ýok etdim
There is no question about that.	Bu hakda hiç hili sorag ýok.
I didn't know it was going to bother you	Munuň sizi biynjalyk etjekdigini bilmedim
I don't want to hurt you	Men size zyýan bermek islämok
This is bad.	Bu erbet.
He could still see it.	Ol henizem ony görüp bilýärdi.
You have to worry about it.	Ol hakda alada etmeli.
I think he already knew	Meniň pikirimçe, ol eýýäm bilýärdi
It should be stopped immediately.	Muny derrew bes etmeli.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
It wasn't long.	Uzak däldi.
I haven’t done that in years	Birnäçe ýyl bäri beýle etmedim
I want to do something completely stupid	Men düýbünden samsyk bir zat etmek isleýärin
There is no shortcut to a great sound.	Ajaýyp ses üçin gysga ýol ýok.
He can do that.	Muny edip biler.
Of course he knew that.	Elbetde, muny bilýärdi.
I hope this is not bad	Munuň erbet däldigini umyt edýärin
I want more	Mundan has köp zat isleýärin
Which would be nice.	Haýsy gowy bolardy.
I was never myself	Men asla özüm däldim
What?	Näme?
Maybe you can tell.	Belki aýdyp bilersiňiz.
A long time ago	Köp wagt mundan ozal
There would be a lot of attention and a lot of people.	Köp üns we köp adam bolardy.
He is ready for it.	Ol muňa taýyn.
Big to you	Uly saňa
Here we are.	Ine, biz kim.
I had to tell him a lot	Men oňa gaty köp zat aýtmaly boldum
I am just like that.	Men edil şonuň ýaly.
A month ago it seemed impossible.	Bir aý öň bu mümkin däl ýalydy.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
Every day has been a wonderful day.	Her gün ajaýyp gün boldy.
I hope this is good news for him	Bu onuň üçin gowy habar diýip umyt edýärin
He does more.	Has köp zat edýär.
I think it's time for him to call me.	Meniň pikirimçe, onuň maňa jaň eden wagty geldi.
It was not hard to see.	Ony görmek kyn däldi.
No one wanted to.	Hiç kim islemedi.
It's beautiful.	Bu owadan.
You have to do it right	Dogry etmeli
We can't.	Biz edip bilmeris.
The girl is fine.	Gyz gowy.
I have to get and get.	Men almaly we almaly.
I think that could be something	Meniň pikirimçe, bu bir zat bolup biler
He wanted it.	Ol muny isledi.
In fact, they are there.	Aslynda olar şol ýerde.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
It will take time, maybe a long time.	Oňa wagt gerek, belki uzak wagt gerek bolar.
Everyone knows.	Hemmeler biler.
Who is he	Ol kim.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň etjek bolýan zady.
There is good news for you.	Siziň üçin gowy habar bar.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
This is crazy.	Bu däli.
I saw what happened	Näme bolandygyny gördüm
It really helps me.	Bu hakykatdanam maňa kömek edýär.
Good song.	Gowy aýdym.
The problem was not there before.	Mesele bu ýerde öňem ýokdy.
I can do that	Men muny edip bilerin
What are you	Sen näme
I was not that worried	Men beýle bir biynjalyk däldim
It should be now.	Indi bu bolmaly.
Now is not the time.	Häzirki wagtda wagt däl.
This is a crazy proposal.	Bu däli teklip.
That was never the case.	Bu hiç haçan mesele däldi.
This is what you want.	Bu seniň isleýän zadyň.
This is indeed possible.	Bu hakykatdanam mümkin.
I want a close one	Men ýakyn birini isleýärin
There must be another way.	Başga bir ýol bolmaly.
I got a few answers from him	Men oňa birnäçe jogap aldym
I told her again.	Men oňa ýene bir gezek aýtdym.
It's hard for me to buy anything	Men hiç zat satyn almak kyn
It won't happen anymore.	Indi bolmaz.
He never said that.	Ol muny hiç haçan aýtmady.
I don't know how long it has been around.	Näçe wagt bäri bardygyny bilemok.
I have to get it now	Men ony indi almaly
I can't see anything else	Başga zat görüp bilemok
I can be honest	Dogry aýdyp bilerin
I felt like I knew nothing	Hiç zat bilmeýän ýaly boldum
There are actually two things.	Aslynda iki zat.
I need some advice and someone to talk to	Maňa birneme maslahat we gürleşmek üçin biri gerek
It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
I can't give you time or attention	Men size wagt ýa-da üns berip bilemok
Not great or anything else, but good.	Ajaýyp ýa-da başga zat däl, ýöne gowy.
I really care about you	Men hakykatdanam seni alada edýärin
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
It's weird.	Ol geň.
I need a job	Maňa iş gerek
It could be.	Bolup biler.
Maybe a lot of life.	Belki köp durmuş.
I can't see him anymore	Men ony indi görüp bilemok
I still want to be with you	Men henizem siziň bilen bolmak isleýärin
Hopefully this will be the last time this year	Bu ýyl iň soňky gezek bolar diýip umyt edýärin
He is right.	Dogry aýdýar.
This is not even the case.	Bu hatda beýle däl.
This is not a good time.	Bu gowy wagt däl.
Then the police.	Soň polisiýa.
There will be something that will help us somewhere.	Bir ýerde bize kömek etjek bir zat bolar.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
I am not such a person.	Men beýle adam däl.
I don't know if there's anything worse	Has erbet zadyň bardygyny bilemok
He tells me everything.	Ol maňa hemme zady aýdýar.
I did it.	Men muny etdim.
Bad time	Erbet wagt.
You have to go together.	Bile gitmeli.
I almost never saw him at home	Men ony öýde görmedim diýen ýaly
We can go now.	Häzir gidip bileris.
I knew this very well	Men muny gaty gowy bilýärdim
Oh no, that's not good.	Aý ýok, bu gowy däl.
He did the only thing he could think of.	Ol pikir edip biljek ýekeje zady etdi.
This word	Bu söz.
I couldn't sleep	Men uklap bilmedim
There was nothing else to do about it.	Munuň üçin başga zat ýokdy.
I think it should be good	Gowy bolmaly diýip pikir edýärin
There.	Ol ýerde.
Here's how he knew it was going to be here.	Ine, şu ýerde boljakdygyny nädip bilýärdi.
Everything was still there.	Hemme zat henizem bardy.
It was the same as before.	Bu öňküsi ýaly boldy.
Of course, there was a reason for that.	Elbetde, munuň bir sebäbi bardy.
I really don't know	Men hakykatdanam bilemok
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
I have more questions.	Mende has köp sorag bar.
That's what happened.	Hemme zat şeýle boldy.
In fact, it is not necessary to know.	Aslynda bilmek hökman däl.
I could not find a way	Men hiç hili ýol görüp bilmedim
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Muny ajaýyp ýyl etmek üçin size zerur.
That's all there is to it.	Munuň bilen hemme zat dogry.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I have nothing wrong with them.	Meniň olar bilen erbet zadym ýok.
This was not really for me.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň üçin däldi.
You have to tell him not to	Oňa etmezligi aýtmaly
Correct answer.	Dogry jogap.
It's not just me.	Bu diňe men däl.
I still couldn't fall asleep	Men henizem uklap bilmedim
I think he just wanted to do the right thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol diňe dogry zady etjek boldy.
I had to do it	Men muny etmeli boldum
I told you the truth	Men saňa hakykaty aýtdym
I did this every weekend	Muny her dynç güni etdim
It started to seem like a very bad idea.	Bu gaty erbet pikir ýaly bolup başlady.
What should you be	Sen näme bolmaly
I couldn't say anything about myself	Özüm hakda bir zat aýdyp bilmedim
I have to have something	Men bir zat bolmaly
There will be an opportunity.	Bir mümkinçilik bolar.
He made a short promise	Gysga bir söz berdi
I want it now	Men ony şu wagt isleýärin
I really want that	Men muny gaty isleýärin
I am the only one.	Diňe men bar.
I think that's what happened	Bolýan zat diýip pikir edýärin
He never said a word or said anything.	Ol hiç haçan söz ýa-da hiç zat aýtmady.
I have something to do before	Mundan öňem etmeli zadym bar
I have to be with him now.	Men häzir onuň bilen bolmaly.
This was not an easy task	Bu aňsat iş däldi
Can you think of anything else?	Başga bir zat hakda pikir edip bilersiňizmi?
I know he can	Biljekdigini bilýärin
I thought you were there	Seni bar öýdüpdim
I hoped it would not be against it.	Men muňa garşy bolmaz diýip umyt etdim.
This is not even possible because the error is nothing.	Bu hatda mümkin däl, sebäbi ýalňyşlyk hiç zat däl.
This will not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaz.
I never thought about it.	Men bu hakda asla pikir etmedim.
He was there all day.	Ol bütin gün şol ýerde boldy.
That's all there is to it.	Bu diňe şu.
This is a big deal.	Bu uly mesele.
Himself or me.	Özi ýa-da men.
He knew.	Ol bilýärdi.
I didn't want to do that	Men muny etmek islemedim
There must be a good opportunity for that.	Munuň üçin gowy bir mümkinçilik bar bolsa gerek.
This is for you.	Bu siziň özüňiz üçin.
I'm not like that yet.	Men entek beýle däl.
How long has it been?	Näçe wagt boldy.
It was a day.	Bu bir gün boldy.
It's as if he did something he couldn't do.	Onuň edip bilmeýän zadyny eden ýaly.
It will be just a word.	Bu diňe bir söz bolar.
I may need more time	Maňa has köp wagt gerek bolup biler
There seemed to be nothing else to do.	Başga etmeli zat ýok ýalydy.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl ýaly.
I have a lot of questions	Mende köp sorag bar
Often not.	Köplenç ýok.
I was right.	Dogry aýtdym.
I think that would be nice	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy bolardy
I do things right	Men zatlary dogry edýärin
I couldn’t do anything bad to help	Kömek etmek üçin bir erbet zat edip bilmedim
Me.	Ine.
I am really happy.	Men hakykatdanam bagtly.
This time I am not.	Bu gezek men däl.
I suggest you do this	Muny etmegi teklip edýärin
The worst part is.	Iň erbet zat.
You know how it can be.	Onuň nähili bolup biljekdigini bilýärsiň.
I have it here	Mende şu ýerde bar
We are not like you.	Biz seniň ýaly däl.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
Tell me about it.	Bu hakda maňa aýdyň.
I'm not you!	Men seni däl!
Doing something else.	Başga bir zat etmek.
I couldn't tell anyone about it	Men ol hakda hiç kime aýdyp bilmedim
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
I still don't want to talk about it.	Men entek bu hakda gürleşmek islämok.
I will not be with him	Men onuň bilen bolmaz
Both things are right.	Iki zat hem dogry.
You have no choice.	Size başga ýol ýok.
He got it.	Ol aldy.
I know a lot about you	Men senden köp zady bilýärin
He promised that life would come.	Durmuş bolmaly, diýip söz berdi.
I told her I had to call	Men oňa jaň etmelidigini aýtdym
He lives here.	Ol şu ýerde ýaşaýar.
I promised him	Men oňa söz berdim
Enough about me now.	Indi men hakda ýeterlik.
This is now, the future or both.	Bu indi, geljek ýa-da ikisi.
I didn't see anyone or anything	Men hiç kimi ýa-da hiç zady görmedim
I wonder if he was here	Men onuň şu ýerde bolandygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny bilýärin
You must.	Siz hökman.
I think it helped to be here	Bu ýerde bolmak kömek etdi diýip pikir edýärin
He doesn't do that.	Ol bu işi etmeýär.
He also needs to know everything.	Şeýle hem, ol hemme zady bilýän bolmaly.
This can be difficult.	Muny etmek kyn bolup biler.
I can say that, but it would be a lie	Muny aýdyp bilerin, ýöne ýalan bolar
It will be great.	Ajaýyp bolar.
I tried.	Men synap gördüm.
I knew it would happen.	Elbetde boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
I have this strange problem.	Mende bu geň mesele bar.
Here are a few.	Ine, birnäçe.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
I still have that problem	Mende henizem şol mesele bar
They are so beautiful.	Olar gaty ajaýyp.
I couldn't help it	Men muňa kömek edip bilmedim
It will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek.
They have nothing for me.	Olar mende hiç zat ýok.
The same thing happens now.	Edil şol bir zat indi bolýar.
I heard he really cared about me	Onuň hakykatdanam meni alada edýändigini eşitdim
I don’t know how he does it	Muny nädip edýändigini bilemok
There are several reasons.	Birnäçe sebäp bar.
I don’t have to think about that	Men bu hakda pikir etmeli däl
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
I did it.	Men bu işi etdim.
I have to tell the truth	Men hakykaty aýtmaly
This road does a lot of things.	Bu ýol köp zat edýär.
This is true.	Bu söz dogry.
I think there is a good idea	Gowy pikir bar diýip pikir edýärin
I have to tell the truth.	Hakykaty aýtmaly.
I helped you	Men size kömek etdim
Strange thing.	Geň zat.
That will be the case.	Şeýle bolar.
Now you can sleep easily.	Indi aňsat uklap bilersiňiz.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
This is not difficult at all.	Bu asla kyn däl.
It should be.	Bolmaly.
Which one.	Haýsy.
There is nothing new about this.	Bu barada täze zat ýok.
I just want to be close to you	Men diňe size ýakyn bolmak isleýärin
He has been here for several years.	Ol bu ýerde birnäçe ýyl bäri.
I think it will	Ol şeýle bolar diýip pikir edýärin
She is at home.	Ol öýde.
Here's how you can help.	Ine, nädip kömek edip bilersiňiz.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Has gowy ýol.
They are not happy.	Olar bagtly däl.
Absolutely nothing.	Elbetde hiç zat.
I really don't need it.	Maňa hakykatdanam gerek däl.
Only then could I say no to him	Diňe şol wagt oňa "ýok" diýip bilmedim
Now something is possible, it was never possible before.	Indi bir zat mümkin, bu öň hiç wagt mümkin däldi.
In fact, no one cares.	Aslynda hiç kim hiç zat däl.
I have to tell him the truth	Men oňa hakykaty aýtmaly
It was almost.	Bir diýen ýalydy.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
He knew what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilýärdi.
He still did it.	Ol henizem muny etdi.
It will always be there	Elmydama şol ýerde bolar
This is the last word.	Bu soňky söz.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I believe it can help you	Size kömek edip biljekdigine ynanýaryn
I never thought about it	Men bu hakda asla pikir etmedim
I have to be ready for that	Men muňa taýyn bolmaly
I had no money	Mende pul ýokdy
You know, no.	Bilýärsiň, ýok.
This is a real issue.	Bu hakykatdanam bir mesele.
It's a lie.	Bu ýalan hakda.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
I think that's bad.	Bu erbet diýip pikir edýärin.
I will never be in this house again	Men bu öýde ýene bolmaz
I miss you so much	Men seni gaty erbet isleýärin
It was good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy boldy.
I just thought it myself	Men muny diňe özüm pikir etdim
He would be ready for that.	Ol muňa taýyn bolardy.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
It looks better.	Bu has gowy görünýär.
No one could do that.	Hiç kim muny edip bilmedi.
I had a lot of questions	Mende köp sorag bardy
Good stuff, great !.	Gowy zatlar, gaty gowy !.
Who are you	Bu sen kim.
As before, he was alone.	Öňküsi ýaly, özi ýeke boldy.
I don't care about myself	Men özüm hakda alada etmeýärin
It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
I can't speak much. 	Men has köp gürläp bilemok. 
I have to tell you what happened that night.	Şol gije näme bolandygyny maňa ýene bir gezek aýtmaly.
I didn't know yesterday	Düýn bilmedim
He did not want to do that.	Ol muny etmek islemedi.
I couldn't really tell	Aslynda aýdyp bilmedim
I really want to go.	Men hakykatdanam gitmek isleýärin.
I think everyone knows	Meniň pikirimçe, hemmeler bilýär
I thought he would do it	Men muny eder öýdüpdim
I think about it a lot.	Men bu hakda köp pikir edýärin.
We will never know.	Biz hiç haçan bilmeris.
He could not be here.	Ol bu ýerde bolup bilmedi.
I never saw him	Men ony asla görmedim
I knew there was something wrong with that	Munuň üçin bir zadyň bardygyny bilýärdim
There was a problem here.	Bu ýerde kynçylyk bardy.
This is a really good question.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy sorag.
That helped a little.	Bu birneme kömek etdi.
This is bad for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin erbet.
It's me.	Bu men.
I tried it several times.	Birnäçe gezek synap gördüm.
I found it very difficult.	Men muny gaty kyn gördüm.
He said the same thing.	Ol hem muny aýtdy.
Adult.	Uly adam.
I didn't want to talk to him	Men onuň bilen gürleşmek islemedim
I had fun.	Men hezil etdim.
He thought well	Gowy pikir etdi
Man, you have to go for it.	Adam, sen munuň üçin gitmeli.
Happy for you, happy for me.	Seniň üçin bagtly, meniň üçin bagtly.
What did I think of them?	Olar hakda näme hakda pikir etdim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Indi şeýle boldy.
I never liked it	Men muny hiç haçan gowy görmedim
He was not a man.	Bu adam däldi.
I was very worried about you there	Men ol ýerde sen hakda gaty alada etdim
She can't answer him.	Ol oňa jogap berip bilmeýär.
I knew why he did that	Näme üçin beýle edendigini bilýärdim
This is really interesting to me.	Bu meniň üçin hakykatdanam gyzykly.
Here is the problem.	Ine, mesele.
I did the necessary things	Zerur zatlary etdim
I was not myself.	Men özüm däldim.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda muny aýtmaly däl.
I didn't do it today	Men bu gün etmedim
I am very happy to see him.	Men ony görüp gaty begenýärin.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
He wanted it and got it.	Ol ony isledi we aldy.
He didn't want to.	Ol muny islemedi.
We are really weird.	Biz hakykatdanam geň zat.
I gave him the money	Men oňa pul berdim
I didn't know it existed	Men onuň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
I have to be happy right now.	Men şu wagt bagtly bolmaly.
What a crazy time.	Nähili däli wagt.
He wants to be something.	Ol bir zat bolmak isleýär.
Not good either.	Şeýle hem gowy däl.
I think that is the answer.	Bu jogap diýip pikir edýärin.
Nothing can be done.	Hiç zat edip bolmaz.
It should be good.	Gowy bolmaly.
I borrowed for you	Men seniň üçin karz aldym
I have never been like you	Men hiç wagt seniň ýaly bolup bilmedim
I really think so	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle diýip pikir edýärin
I thought it was great.	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim.
We can't do anything interesting this week.	Bu hepde gyzykly bir zat edip bilmeris.
Good to see you	Seni görmek gowy zat.
He will be closer.	Ol has ýakyn bolar.
It can do a lot, but nothing really good.	Köp zat edip biler, ýöne hakykatdanam gowy zat ýok.
I am not that person	Men ol adam däl
He just says it himself.	Diňe özüni aýdýar.
He asked who was there.	Ol kimiň bardygyny sorady.
I'm not good.	Men gowy däl.
I have never seen such a thing	Men asla beýle zady görmedim
Because he couldn't.	Sebäbi edip bilmedi.
He could not be himself.	Ol özi bolup bilmedi.
I didn't know what to do	Näme etmelidigimi bilmedim
Bad sound.	Erbet ses.
I don't trust anyone.	Men hiç kime ynanamok.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, beýle däl.
This is absolutely possible.	Bu düýbünden mümkin.
He came.	Ol geldi.
I have a call to make	Jaň etmek üçin maňa jaň bar
You have to do better.	Has gowy etmeli.
They weren't really enough.	Olar hakykatdanam ýeterlik däldi.
He can't help anyone right now.	Ol häzir hiç kime kömek edip bilmeýär.
Bar, gone, gone.	Bar, gitdi, gitdi.
I just know it can be done	Edip boljakdygyny diňe bilýärin
I totally agree	Men doly razy bolaryn
This is not the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek däl.
I was not ready an hour ago	Bir sagat öňem taýyn däldim
The next thing, he's gone.	Indiki zat, ol gitdi.
I know no one else knows about it	Bu hakda başga hiç kimiň bilmeýändigini bilýärin
Someone is ours.	Kimdir biri biziň.
I was really crazy.	Men hakykatdanam däli boldum.
Such a wonderful song.	Şeýle ajaýyp aýdym.
No decision.	Karar ýok.
He told her this several times.	Oňa muny birnäçe gezek aýtdy.
I'm so scared.	Men gaty gorkýaryn.
It helped us.	Bu bize kömek etdi.
I hope you are well.	Gowy bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin.
He was a little surprised.	Ol birneme geň galdy.
I tried to call him again	Men oňa ýene jaň etjek boldum
That's all you have to do	Ine, seniň bar zadyň
Police.	Polisiýa.
I didn't really know.	Aslynda bilmedim.
Not so big.	Şeýle bir uly däl.
That's what he wanted.	Ol muny şeýle isledi.
I decided.	Men karar berdim.
Because he seemed happy.	Sebäbi ol bagtly ýalydy.
I couldn't even answer him	Men oňa hatda jogap berip bilmedim
Great place.	Ajaýyp ýerde.
That should be sufficient enough.	Bu ýeterlik bolmaly.
Then he gave her a book.	Soň bolsa oňa kitap berdi.
It took a while.	Biraz wagt gerek boldy.
You have to do this together.	Muny bilelikde etmeli.
It takes money.	Munuň üçin pul gerek.
I didn't know how to do it	Muny nädip etmelidigimi bilmedim
I haven't thought about it for a long time.	Köp wagt bäri bu hakda pikir etmedim.
I had to do that	Men muny şeýle etmeli boldum
I had no one left	Mende indi adam ýokdy
This also seems strange.	Bu hem geň görünýär.
They are.	Olar.
He took me a bit.	Ol meni birneme aldy.
I knew he didn't want to hurt me	Men onuň maňa zyýan bermek islemeýändigini bilýärdim
I saw everything.	Men hemme zady gördüm.
This will not always be the case.	Elmydama beýle bolmaz.
I never objected	Men muňa asla garşy däldim
This or that, or not.	Bu ýa-da olar, ýa-da ýok.
I've tried things like this	Seniň ýaly zatlary synap gördüm
I can do things for you	Men seniň üçin zatlar edip bilerin
They can also be many.	Şeýle hem olar köp bolup biler.
I had a lot of fun	Men gaty hezil etdim
I do.	Men edýärin.
This is good news.	Bu gowy habar.
There was so much to hope for.	Munuň üçin umyt etmek gaty kän boldy.
So we can only do one thing about it.	Şonuň üçin bu hakda diňe bir zat edip bileris.
I'm really sorry	Men hakykatdanam gynanýaryn
It's just about money now.	Ol häzir diňe pul hakda.
This is not a man.	Bu adam däl.
I think it will be interesting	Bu gyzykly bolar diýip pikir edýärin
It's too late.	Köp gitdi.
Not to be outdone.	Üns bermeli däl.
In fact, there was nothing to do.	Aslynda etmeli zat ýokdy.
He could not help himself.	Ol özüne kömek edip bilmedi.
Everyone.	Hemmeler.
This is exactly what happens here.	Bu ýerde edil şu bolýar.
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
What happened	Näme boldy?
It was never just the two of them.	Hiç haçan diňe ikisi däldi.
No one could see me.	Hiç kim meni görüp bilmedi.
Excellent three.	Ajaýyp üç.
He understood that and allowed me to do so.	Ol muňa düşündi we maňa rugsat berdi.
I'm not doing anything else.	Men başga zat etmeýärin.
Here is a way.	Ine bir ýol.
I don't do that again	Men muny ýene etmeýärin
He told me.	Ol maňa aýtdy.
I need it now	Maňa indi gerek
He could do nothing.	Ol hiç zat edip bilmedi.
There are two issues there.	Ol ýerde iki mesele bar.
I just didn’t want to say anything	Men diňe bir zat aýtmak islemedim
If anyone can help me.	Kimdir biri maňa kömek edip bilýän bolsa.
We can do that.	Muny edip bileris.
We are with him.	Biz onuň bilen.
I did this a week ago	Men muny bir hepde öň etdim
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Not her, but she looks so beautiful.	Ony däl, ýöne gaty owadan görünýär.
I told her what had happened	Men oňa näme bolandygyny aýtdym
Long, hard road	Uzak, kyn ýol
Now something else.	Indi başga zat.
Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh!	Bir zatlar hakda gürleşmek.
I think young.	Meniň pikirimçe ýaş.
I have seen this happen many times.	Munuň köp gezek bolandygyny gördüm.
His job was not good.	Onuň işi gowy däldi.
I just want to be myself	Men diňe özüm bolmak isleýärin
I can do this with you all day	Men muny bütin gün seniň bilen edip bilerin
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
He has to do everything himself.	Hemme zady özi etmeli.
I didn't want to talk	Men gürleşmek islemedim
It came out.	Çykdy.
There is a problem.	Mesele bar.
He said there was no way.	Ol hiç hili ýol ýok diýdi.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
In fact, I was pretty good at it	Aslynda men munuň ýaly gowy boldum
It could be that.	Bu hem bolup biler.
I have to go to work	Men işe gitmeli
I will be everything to you	Men seniň üçin hemme zat bolaryn
I think he really likes me	Meniň pikirimçe, ol meni hakykatdanam halaýar
He doesn't want to think.	Ol pikir etmek islemeýär.
I want to be happy.	Men bagtly bolmak isleýärin.
I've never done that before.	Men muny ozal etmedim.
I decided.	Men karar berdim.
I had no idea he had so much	Oňa gaty köp zadyň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
You have to be clear about that.	Bu barada aýdyň bolmaly.
This is not new.	Bu täze däl.
I just rested	Men diňe dynç aldym
I have never seen anything like it before.	Ozal beýle zat görmedim.
This is a new issue.	Bu täze mesele.
I had to help her.	Men oňa kömek etmeli boldum.
That was never the case.	Bu hiç haçan mesele däldi.
This seems to be true.	Bu dogry ýaly.
I was not crazy at all	Men düýbünden däli däldim
I didn't think so myself	Men özüm öýdemokdym
He and he.	Ol we özi.
I knew better	Men has gowy bilýärdim
Because he is not.	Sebäbi ol ýok.
I knew he had it	Men onuň bardygyny bilýärdim
He was everywhere.	Ol hemme ýerde bardy.
In fact, I didn't do that	Aslynda beýle etmedim
Only so.	Diňe şeýle.
This is the hardest thing.	Bu iň kyn zat.
I'm not fast	Men çalt däl
I can't say whether he knows it or not	Bilýändigini ýa-da ýokdugyny aýdyp bilemok
I know tomorrow morning	Ertir irden bilýärin
Now the interesting things are coming.	Indi gyzykly zatlar gelýär.
Really, you are wonderful.	Hakykatdanam, sen ajaýyp.
Neither do we.	Biz hem däl.
I couldn’t get much help there	Men ol ýerde kän bir kömek alyp bilmedim
Of course you can call.	Elbetde jaň edip bilersiňiz.
He did three things.	Üç zat etdi.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
Nothing serious, just fun.	Çynlakaý zat ýok, diňe gyzykly.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, muny etmeli.
I'm crazy, that's a lot	Men däli boldum, bu köp zat
This is a big day.	Bu uly gün.
He wants to.	Ol isleýär.
I'll do whatever I need	Näme gerek bolsa ederin
This should not be so difficult.	Bu beýle kyn bolmaly däl.
He can't, he can't, he can't.	Ol edip bilmeýär, edip bilmeýär, edip bilmeýär.
There is a lot of news for them	Olar üçin köp habar bar
He had no hope.	Oňa umyt ýokdy.
Is it already there?	Öňem barmy?
There are more people out of work.	Işden has köp adam bar.
I could not allow it	Men muňa rugsat berip bilmedim
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman däl.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
Go back to school.	Mekdebe gaýdyp bar.
Always do that	Elmydama muny et.
I hope it will be good	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
He said every year.	Ol her ýyl aýtdy.
I can't tell you	Men saňa aýdyp biljek däl
I have nothing wrong with them.	Olar bilen erbet zadym ýok.
I didn't mean to offend you	Men muny siziň üçin islemedim
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu dogry däl ýaly.
There is no such thing as a 'problem'.	Munuň ýaly 'mesele' ýok.
Really beautiful.	Hakykatdanam owadan.
I have a problem.	Mende bir mesele bar.
I think that word came out about me	Bu söz meniň hakda çykdy öýdýän
No one called me.	Hiç kim maňa jaň etmedi.
I need a little rest	Maňa ýene biraz dynç gerek
For me, these are two.	Meniň üçin bu ikisi.
I only have a few questions	Mende diňe birnäçe sorag bar
He didn't just say that.	Ol muny diňe bir aýtmady.
I thought long and hard about it.	Bu hakda uzak we kyn pikir etdim.
With a book.	Kitap bilen.
He will never know.	Ol hiç wagt bilmez.
They are very difficult.	Olar gaty kyn.
I knew what he was going to do	Men onuň näme etjekdigini bilýärdim
I had to stop it	Men muny bes etmeli boldum
There is good and bad.	Gowy we erbet zat bar.
She must be a girl.	Ol gyz bolmaly.
Right there, there really is something.	Edil şu ýerde, hakykatdanam bir zat bar.
"It's not me," he said.	Ol: "Bu men däl" -diýdi.
I can almost see it	Men ony diýen ýaly görüp bilýärin
What.	Näme.
I also knew about him	Men ol hakda hem bilýärdim
This is the last resort.	Bu soňky ýol.
There was no man.	Adam ýokdy.
Not at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda däl.
About something.	Bir zat hakda.
He doesn't care about such things.	Ol beýle zatlar hakda alada etmeýär.
I can see everything about me	Men hakda hemme zady görüp bilýärin
I couldn't take it	Men özümi alyp bilmedim
He knew a lot.	Ol köp zady bilýärdi.
Only now it was the worst.	Diňe indi iň erbet boldy.
I have such good news	Mende şeýle gowy habar bar
Maybe it's just me.	Belki, bu diňe men.
Not just this morning.	Diňe şu gün irden däl.
It was good too.	Gowy hem bardy.
In fact, several times this evening.	Aslynda şu agşam birnäçe gezek.
If for a reason.	Sebäp üçin bolsa.
I'll do it tomorrow	Ertir muny ederin
I still don't know how	Men entek nädip bilemok
I can't get a job	Men iş alyp bilemok
I didn’t want to hurt him	Men oňa zyýan bermek islemedim
I didn't think so	Men pikir etmedim
It may take several hours.	Birnäçe sagat bolup biler.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Men hiç zat aýtmak islemedim.
Of course he would be there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde bolardy.
I didn't mean to offend you	Men saňa zyýan bermek islemedim
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
He was absolutely right.	Ol düýbünden dogry aýtdy.
I have never had such a thing	Mende hiç wagt beýle zat ýokdy
Now he understands.	Indi düşündi.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
I haven't seen the Sun in a few weeks	Birnäçe hepde bäri Güni görmedim
You are really close.	Siz hakykatdanam ýakyn.
Nice to meet you too	Seni hem görmek gaty gowy.
This was not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däldi.
We are two years old.	Biz iki ýyl.
This is still a bit strange.	Bu henizem birneme geň.
I seemed to have it.	Mende bar ýalydy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hakykatdanam başga zat.
I was not coming	Men geljek däldim
Of course, it was the right word.	Elbetde, dogry söz boldy.
I think there is an idea there	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ýerde bir pikir bar
I can't do that	Men munuň bilen edip bilemok
Must be at home once	Öýde bir gezek bolmaly
He had never done that before.	Ol ozal beýle etmedi.
Maybe he doesn’t know how that happened.	Belki, munuň nädip bolandygyny bilenok.
I had to go far	Uzak gitmeli boldum
It seemed impossible.	Bu mümkin däl ýalydy.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
With us, for the most part.	Biz bilen, köplenç.
He is not coming.	Ol gelenok.
This is possible.	Bu mümkin.
And then he realized.	Soň bolsa düşündi.
I can be there.	Men şol ýerde bolup bilerin.
That's it.	Ol şol.
I should never have done that	Men muny hiç haçan etmeli däldim
You are with him.	Sen onuň bilen.
I can't think of a possibility	Mümkinçilik hakda pikir edip bilemok
This time I was very close	Men bu gezek gaty ýakyn boldum
Of course there is.	Elbetde bar.
There is a serious reason for this.	Munuň çynlakaý sebäbi bar.
You can say it twice	Iki gezek aýdyp bilersiňiz
That was the last word.	Soňky söz boldy.
I didn't even see it	Men hatda görmedim
I knew what he wanted.	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärdim.
Work.	Iş.
I have been there for three years	Men ol ýerde üç ýyl boldum
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
What was the answer?	Bu näme, jogap boldy.
He could not do that.	Ol beýle zat edip bilmedi.
No one wants to talk.	Hiç kim gürleşmek islemeýär.
This is for life.	Bu durmuş üçin.
There was no decision for me.	Meniň üçin hiç hili karar ýokdy.
I can't see this happening	Munuň bolandygyny görüp bilemok
When did this happen.	Bu haçan boldy.
I thought this was a great idea	Bu gaty gowy pikir diýip pikir etdim
It could be like next month.	Geljek aý ýaly bolup biler.
I had a few things to do	Birnäçe etmeli zadym bardy
I'll call him	Men oňa jaň etjek
I was the reason for that	Men munuň sebäbi boldum
Here it is.	Ine, ýok.
There is a serious mistake.	Çynlakaý bir ýalňyşlyk bar.
I just want to talk to him	Men diňe onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
Two people said.	Iki adam aýtdy.
And then.	Soň bolsa.
There were a lot of people there.	Ol ýerde köp adam bardy.
I will not have	Mende bolmaz
Many times before.	Öň köp gezek.
I still do.	Men henizem edýärin.
I can’t really be with him and do a lot of things	Men hakykatdanam onuň bilen bolup, köp zatlary edip bilemok
I'm not good at that.	Men munuň bilen gowy däl.
He is a very good guy.	Ol gaty gowy ýigit.
A week later.	Bir hepde soň.
You are not him	Sen ol däl
It was very bad last night.	Düýn gije gaty erbet boldy.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
Maybe.	Belki.
There must be a reason for that.	Munuň üçin bir sebäp bolmaly.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
I have to do something.	Men bir zatlar etmeli.
I think he is right	Dogry aýdýar öýdýän
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
You don't even have to talk to me.	Hatda meniň bilen gürleşmek hökman däl.
I didn't know what he wanted	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilmedim
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolup bilmez.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
That day	Şol gün.
I don’t know how to do that	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilemok
It didn't hurt him.	Bu oňa zyýan bermedi.
She is smart.	Ol akylly.
He knew it wasn't long.	Uzak däldigini bilýärdi.
I received a lot of messages and welcomed them all	Köp habar aldym we hemmesini garşy aldym
Oh no, no, no.	Aý ýok, ýok, ýok.
I'm not good at all.	Men asla gowy däl.
How can he help me? 	Ol maňa nädip kömek edip biler?
he thought.	diýip pikir etdi.
Do something bad.	Erbet bir zat et.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
I can't speak right	Dogry gürläp bilemok
Maybe there is an opportunity.	Belki, bir mümkinçilik bar.
That could be the case.	Şeýle bolup biler.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilenok.
He had to make a decision	Bir karar bermeli boldy
I know, I'm not very smart	Bilýärin, gaty akylly däl
An hour ago	Bir sagat öň
He said you know.	Bilýärsiň diýdi.
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty kyn mesele.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He said no.	Ol ýok diýdi.
Strange and wonderful	Geň we ajaýyp zat
I'm not asking for that idea.	Bu pikir hakda haýyş etmeýärin.
This is great, really.	Bu gaty gowy, hakykatdanam şeýle.
I had to give it to him	Men oňa bermeli boldum
That can't be bad.	Bu erbet bolup bilmez.
I can't say more now	Men häzir has köp zat aýdyp biljek däl
This is crazy.	Bu däli.
I didn’t even have to do much	Hatda köp iş etmeli däldim
To be the same as before.	Öňküsi ýaly bolmak.
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
I'm afraid it's not far away	Men asla uzak däl diýip gorkýaryn
The reason for this would be very interesting to us.	Munuň sebäbi, biziň bilen gaty gyzykly bolardy.
He is a good man.	Ol gowy adam.
I think this will be great	Bu ajaýyp bolar diýip pikir edýärin
The worst mistake	Iň erbet ýalňyşlyk
Impossible, but very good.	Mümkin däl, ýöne gaty gowy.
And so it was.	Bu hem şeýle boldy.
I have never been happier	Men hiç wagt bagtly bolup görmedim
I saw it once.	Bir gezek gördüm.
It will not happen again.	Mundan beýläk bolmaz.
I know this very well	Men muny gaty gowy bilýärin
There are two answers.	Iki jogap bar.
Something similar could happen tomorrow.	Ertir hem edil şonuň ýaly bir zat bolup biler.
Of course I was crazy	Elbetde däli boldum
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
You can do it here.	Bu ýerde edip bilersiňiz.
What! 	Näme!
How	Nädip
He is still here.	Ol henizem şu ýerde.
I have a lot.	Mende gaty köp.
A girl can do worse	Bir gyz has erbet edip biler
I'm sure he'll do well.	Gowy etjekdigine ynanýaryn.
I want that	Men muny isleýärin
Good things are there.	Gowy zatlar şol ýerde.
He said.	Ol aýtdy.
I don't think they were ready for me	Meniň pikirimçe, olar meniň üçin taýyn däldi
I can only go	Men diňe gidip bilerin
I'm not a bad person.	Men erbet adam däl.
That didn't help much.	Bu kän kömek etmedi.
Why? 	Näme üçin?
I still want to do a few things with you	Men henizem siziň bilen birnäçe zat etmek isleýärin
He didn't have to be here.	Ol bu ýerde bolmaly däldi.
I noticed that, too	Men hem muňa üns berdim
I think it looks really beautiful right now	Meniň pikirimçe, häzirki wagtda hakykatdanam owadan görünýär
I don't think he has anything to say	Onuň aýdyp biljek zady ýok öýdýän
Nothing can be a lie.	Hiç zat ýalan bolup bilmez.
That was the case last night.	Düýn agşam şeýle boldy.
I will be a good guy	Men gowy ýigit bolaryn
I knew something like this was going to happen	Munuň ýaly bir zadyň boljakdygyny bilýärdim
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Siz diňe etmeli.
And very smart.	We gaty akylly.
Three weeks ago.	Üç hepde öň.
I couldn't think of him anymore	Men indi ol hakda pikir edip bilmedim
He did it alone.	Ol ýeke-täk etdi.
It's really bad, but we can't help it.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet, ýöne biz oňa kömek edip bilmeris.
I couldn't do it alone	Men muny ýeke edip bilmedim
Maybe more.	Belki has köp bolmagy mümkin.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
I didn’t know if he did or not	Onuň edendigini ýa-da etmeýändigini bilmedim
He did not answer.	Muňa jogap bermedi.
It happened again.	Bu ýene boldy.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
Only this year.	Diňe şu ýyl.
There is nothing very interesting about it.	Bu hakda gaty bir gyzykly zat ýok.
Neither is he.	Ol hem däl.
I have to be there tonight.	Men şu gije şol ýerde bolmaly.
You know it, but it doesn't.	Muny bilýärsiň, ýöne beýle däl.
I couldn't do that for a while.	Men muny birneme edip bilmedim.
One way or another.	Bir ýa-da başga.
Of course, this is a fun week for us.	Elbetde, bu biziň üçin gyzykly hepde.
I must have done something	Men bir zatlar eden bolmaly
It may disappear.	Ol ýok bolmagy mümkin.
He thought it was strange.	Bu geň zat diýip pikir etdi.
I answered that.	Men muňa jogap berdim.
I just thought about the police	Men diňe polisiýa hakda pikir etdim
You really have to pay more attention.	Hakykatdanam has köp üns bermeli.
This is very serious.	Bu gaty çynlakaý.
I think that was the case	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle boldy
Everything is complete.	Hemme zat doly.
I think it needs to be clear.	Munuň aýdyň bolmagy zerur diýip pikir edýärin.
There is a very short time here.	Bu ýerde gaty gysga wagt bar.
For us.	Biziň üçin.
Maybe next.	Belki indiki.
There must be a good reason for that.	Munuň gowy sebäbi bolmaly.
You will not be short.	Sen gysga bolmaz.
Maybe you can give it a try.	Belki synap görüp bilersiňiz.
He wants to be.	Ol bolmak isleýär.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň sebäbi hem şu.
Decided for a few days.	Birnäçe gün karar berdi.
I can see it now	Men ony häzir görüp bilýärin
He gave her everything.	Oňa bar zady berdi.
It's not easy yet.	Bu henizem aňsat däl.
In fact, there is no money.	Aslynda pul ýok.
I know something bad happened there	Şol ýerde erbet bir zadyň bolandygyny bilýärin
Everyone else is there.	Başga hemmeler bar.
He didn't say anything to me.	Ol maňa hiç zat aýtmady.
I don't have to do that	Men muny etmeli däl
Of course, there was no such thing.	Elbetde, beýle zat ýokdy.
I've heard it three times	Men muny üç gezek eşitdim
She can't help herself.	Özüne kömek edip bilmeýär.
I saw you twice a few weeks ago	Birnäçe hepde öň seni iki gezek gördüm
Who can say such a thing.	Kim beýle zady aýdyp biler.
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýok.
Of course, it is very difficult.	Elbetde, ol gaty kyn.
Only sound and sound.	Diňe ses we ses.
I just want to give myself to him	Men diňe özümi oňa bermek isleýärin
I just thought about leaving	Men diňe gitmek hakda pikir etdim
I have so much fun with you	Men siziň bilen gaty hezil
That's a lot.	Bu köp.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
I didn't always have one	Elmydama mende ýokdy
I haven't seen him in a while	Men ony birnäçe wagt bäri görmedim
Not now, not now.	Indi däl, indi däl.
I would like to visit there one day.	Bir gün ol ýere baryp görmek isleýärin.
I knew the truth	Men hakykaty bilýärdim
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
I do very well.	Men gaty gowy edýärin.
I can't decide right now	Men häzir karar berip bilemok
It was hard.	Bu kyn boldy.
He is really here.	Ol hakykatdanam şu ýerde.
I think that's good advice	Bu gowy maslahat diýip pikir edýärin
I was busy for a while	Biraz wagt meşgul boldum
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, edil şonuň ýaly.
I want to be here.	Men şu ýerde bolmak isleýärin.
Of course, that was not enough.	Elbetde, bu ýeterlik däldi.
I thought it looked bad	Erbet görünýär öýdüpdim
We can think together.	Biz bilelikde pikir edip bileris.
I have a lot of doubts about that.	Men muňa gaty şübhelenýärin.
I didn't do that	Men muny etmedim
Not so today.	Bu gün beýle däl.
I've only seen it twice.	Men ony diňe iki gezek gördüm.
I know enough to do that	Muny etmäge ýeterlik bilýärin
This is indeed the case.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle.
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle bolmaly däldi
Really smart.	Hakykatdanam akylly.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
Life seemed very short.	Durmuş gaty gysga ýalydy.
I am a very big man	Men gaty uly adam
He doesn't like you.	Ol seni halamaýar.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
I paid attention to him	Men oňa üns berdim
I have seen him many times	Men oňa gaty köp gezek gördüm
The problem is not new.	Kynçylyk täze däl.
That's more.	Bu has köp.
I didn’t know why he was worried	Näme üçin alada edýändigini bilmedim
I thought it would be harder	Munuň has kyn boljakdygyny pikir etdim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there. "	Ol gaty dogry ”.
I hope no one else paid attention	Başga hiç kim üns bermedi diýip umyt edýärin
I need it here	Maňa şu ýerde gerek
I can't see, but I don't mind	Men görüp bilemok, ýöne maňa garşy däl
This is not the only thing.	Bu diňe bir zat däl.
He is just like him.	Bu edil onuň ýaly adam.
We can say that.	Muny aýdyp bileris.
He knows nothing.	Ol hiç zady bilmeýär.
Time seemed not to be there.	Wagt ol ýerde ýok ýalydy.
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şeýle boldy.
I can see it.	Men ony görüp bilýärin.
Of course not in the near future.	Elbetde ýakyn wagtda däl.
You are somewhere	Sen bir ýerde.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Not like them.	Olar ýaly däl.
I can see so much.	Men şeýle köp zady görüp bilýärin.
He must have done the right thing	Dogry bir zat eden bolmaly
I knew it as a book.	Men muny kitap ýaly bilýärdim.
It's not hard work, it's something to do.	Kyn iş däl, etmeli bir iş.
I couldn't even do it	Men hatda muny edip bilmedim
The problem will be the sound.	Mesele ses bolar.
He knew full well.	Ol muny doly bilýärdi.
I didn't want to talk about it	Bu hakda gürleşmek islemedim
Mostly.	Köplenç.
I admire you very much	Men size gaty haýran
You are younger than me	Sen menden has ýaş.
I answered.	Men jogap berdim.
I still can't.	Men henizem edip bilemok.
This is a wonderful life.	Bu ajaýyp durmuş.
I did everything myself.	Men hemme zady özüm etdim.
I bought it and decided to do it myself	Ony satyn alyp, özüm karar berdim
He told me that.	Ol maňa muny aýtdy.
I didn’t want to think that way.	Men beýle pikir etmek islemedim.
I need money today.	Maňa şu gün pul gerek.
I think it just takes time	Meniň pikirimçe, oňa diňe wagt gerek
It will be easier now.	Indi aňsat bolar.
Of course it happened.	Elbetde boldy.
We are everywhere.	Biz hemme ýerde.
He came himself.	Ol özi geldi.
I could go there every day	Men ol ýere her gün baryp bilýärdim
It was a good evening.	Gowy agşam boldy.
It looks great.	Gaty gowy görünýär.
He wants to go.	Ol gitmek isleýär.
There will be a lot that night.	Şol agşam köp zat bolar.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
Tell me.	Maňa aýdyň.
I don't know how long it has been there	Ol ýerde näçe wagt bolandygyny bilemok
He knows that.	Ol muny bilýär.
Thought does nothing.	Pikir hiç hili zat etmeýär.
That's the way it is.	Şeýle bolýar.
I did it myself	Muny özüm etdim
Stupid stupid.	Samsyk samsyk.
No news.	Habar ýok.
I just had to get you	Men diňe seni almaly boldum
Then life happens.	Soň durmuş bolýar.
This is a debt to you.	Bu size karz.
I know he did it for me.	Munuň meniň üçin edendigini bilýärin.
Seems to have helped a bit.	Biraz kömek eden ýaly.
No one else knows.	Başga hiç kim bilmez.
I couldn't see it.	Men ony görüp bilmedim.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I didn't know that.	Men muny bilmeýärdim.
It's too far to see.	Köp zady görmek gaty uzak.
This is for us and for us.	Bu biziň üçin we biz hakda.
He had to do it.	Ol muny etmeli boldy.
That's great.	Bu ajaýyp zat.
I know, I did something stupid.	Bilýän, samsyk bir zat etdim.
It was not night.	Ol gije däldi.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
I have been here several times	Men bu ýerde birnäçe gezek boldum
Of course, everyone knows that.	Elbetde, muny hemmeler bilýär.
It can't be right.	Dogry bolup bilmez.
It was great for us.	Bu biziň üçin gaty gowy boldy.
I trust you very much	Men saňa gaty ynanýaryn
That there is nothing else.	Başga zadyň ýokdugyny.
Whatever you need!	Size näme gerek bolsa!
I heard that.	Men muny eşitdim.
Many days are hard.	Köp gün kyn.
I think it looks great	Meniň pikirimçe, gaty gowy görünýär
You have to go now.	Indi gitmeli.
I didn't know anything about him or her	Men ol hakda ýa-da ol hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
Really good	Hakykatdanam gaty gowy
I knew something was going to happen	Bir zadyň boljakdygyny bilýärdim
That's right.	Dogry.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman däl.
I was very concerned about this issue.	Bu mesele hakda gaty alada etdim.
Only he can say that.	Diňe muny aýdyp biler.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
I think it will only take a few days.	Diňe birnäçe gün gerek bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
I want to talk about it	Men bu hakda gürleşmek isleýärin
It was not necessary to see him again.	Ony ýene görmek hökman däldi.
There is a good reason for that.	Munuň hem gowy sebäbi bar.
That was not the case before.	Ozal beýle däldi.
He is here today.	Ol şu gün şu ýerde.
I have something better.	Mende has gowy zat bar.
I care about you	Men sen hakda alada edýärin
Everything is new.	Hemme zat täze.
Of course, he couldn't get what he wanted.	Elbetde, islän zadyny alyp bilmedi.
No one told me.	Hiç kim maňa aýtmady.
This is a big decision.	Bu uly karar.
I told her she was OK	Men onuň erbet däldigini aýtdym
I knew nothing about it	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
I have a reason.	Mende sebäp bar.
I still do that.	Men henizem muny edýärin.
In fact, it is not.	Aslynda, beýle däl.
I can't tell anyone about it	Bu hakda hiç kime aýdyp biljek däl
I almost didn't care anymore	Indi alada etmedim diýen ýaly
Not good, but he told himself it would be.	Gowy däl, ýöne şeýle bolar diýip, özüne aýtdy.
Many and many.	Köp we köp.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
I didn't care about tomorrow	Ertir hakda alada etmedim
He said.	Ol şeýle diýdi.
You don't have to do that.	Beýle etmeli däl.
I'm very worried about that.	Men bu barada gaty alada edýärin.
I want to be with you	Men siziň bilen bolmak isleýärin
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
What happened?	Bu näme boldy.
I called again.	Men ýene jaň etdim.
It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
I was not	Men beýle däldi
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
We are here.	Biz şu ýerde.
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
He took me.	Ol meni aldy.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
This is interesting.	Munuň özi gyzykly.
We need it every day now.	Bize indi her gün gerek.
And now there would be two.	Indi bolsa iki bolardy.
He will be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolar.
I can't hire him	Men ony işe alyp bilemok
I tried to call him	Men oňa jaň etjek boldum
He did not know.	Ol bilmedi.
I had to do it for him	Men onuň üçin muny etmeli boldum
Everything.	Hemme zat.
I didn't mean to offend you, but I do.	Saňa aýtmak islemedim, ýöne bar.
Because it was not.	Sebäbi beýle däldi.
I couldn't sleep	Men uklap bilmedim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe iş.
Bad thing, even.	Erbet bir zat, hatda.
Everything will be new.	Hemme zat täze bolar.
He can't tell us.	Ol bize aýdyp bilmeýär.
I know, I always do	Bilýän, men elmydama edýärin
For two reasons.	Bu iki sebäp üçin.
To be here	Şu ýerde bolmak.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, muňa garşy bolmaz.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
I knew what he wanted	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärdim
He will do what he has to do.	Etmeli zadyny eder.
That he would do it.	Muny etjekdigini.
Last but not least.	Iň soňky.
Not here.	Bu ýerde däl.
The decision was made.	Karar çykdy.
It took me a while to figure it out.	Muny bilmek üçin biraz wagt aldym.
I am several years older	Menden birnäçe ýaş uly
I hope everything is fine	Hemme zat gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
There was no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
The reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi.
I told you what happened	Men saňa näme bolandygyny aýtdym
Okay, we're fine.	Bolýar, biz gowy.
I have to tell him.	Men oňa aýtmaly.
She is trying to help me.	Ol maňa kömek etjek bolýar.
A long time ago.	Köp wagt mundan ozal.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
Bar	Bar
Because you are good.	Sebäbi sen gowy.
I didn't know that.	Men muny bilmeýärdim.
I didn't want to go anywhere else	Başga ýere gitmek islemedim
I always had	Mende elmydama bardy
I had to go.	Men gitmeli boldum.
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
It's so easy.	Munuň ýaly aňsat.
He didn't want to go last night.	Düýn gije gitmek islemedi.
Everything about him.	Ol hakda hemme zat.
Often the same thing.	Köplenç şol bir zat.
I saw it myself.	Men muny özüm gördüm.
No one did that.	Hiç kim muny etmedi.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
Everyone is doing the same	Her kim şol bir zady edýär
The answer was interesting.	Jogap gyzykly boldy.
Not bad, not bad.	Ajaýyp däl bolsa, erbet däl.
He allowed it to do so.	Ol muny etmäge rugsat berdi.
It came out.	Çykdy.
Something bad.	Bir zat erbet.
I didn't have to worry about it	Men onuň hakda alada etmeli däldim
Maybe never.	Belki hiç wagt bolmaz.
Something was wrong, he knew it.	Bir zat erbet däldi, muny bilýärdi.
Always on the ground.	Elmydama ýere.
I didn't mean to offend him	Men oňa aýtmak islemedim
This is great for you.	Bu size gaty gowy.

Not this time either.	Bu gezek hem däl.
I am very good and very happy.	Men gaty gowy we gaty bagtly.
There was already one of you today.	Şu gün eýýäm senden biri bardy.
I couldn't see anyone else, only him	Başga birini görüp bilmedim, diňe özi
I admire and enjoy it	Men muňa gaty haýran we hezil edýärin
I want to be with them	Men olar bilen bile bolmak isleýärin
As long as it takes.	Näçe wagt gerek bolsa.
Not surprisingly.	Geň däl.
No one did that.	Hiç kim muny etmedi.
You can be happy.	Bagtly bolup bilersiňiz.
This is not much.	Bu kän däl.
And then	Soň bolsa
I have not always been like that	Men elmydama beýle däldim
This is what we need most.	Bu bize iň zerur zat.
I usually need two nights	Maňa köplenç iki gije gerek
I'll do better next time	Indiki gezek has gowy ederin
I was with him.	Men onuň bilen bile boldum.
I can make you crazy	Men seni däli edip bilerin.

That will be the case.	Şeýle zat bolar.
Please. "	Haýyş edýärin "diýdi.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
I hope everyone has a great day	Her kimiň ajaýyp güni bolar diýip umyt edýärin
This is often the case.	Köplenç şeýle bolýar.
That would be a stupid question.	Bu samsyk sorag bolardy.
Does he know 	Ol bilýärmi?
It would be bad.	Erbet bir zat bolardy.
The reason is enough.	Munuň sebäbi ýeterlik.
I could not allow it	Men muňa rugsat berip bilmedim
It’s about what actually happened.	Aslynda bolup geçen zatlar hakda.
There are many short answers.	Gysga jogap köp.

Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
I never did that	Men muny hiç haçan etmedim
I didn't want to do that.	Men muny etmek islemedim.
I was so stupid	Men gaty samsyk boldum
Not about that.	Bu hakda däl.
You have to pay attention.	Üns bermeli.
This is never a guy.	Bu hiç haçan ýigit däl.
We must.	Biz hökman etmeli.
There is no serious problem with it.	Onuň bilen çynlakaý mesele ýok.
This is not good news.	Bu gowy habar däl.
There must be something else.	Başga bir zat bolmaly.

Such things are not for us.	Munuň ýaly zatlar biziň üçin däl.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
This, of course, was difficult for me	Bu, elbetde, meniň üçin kyn boldy
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
You actually have to go home	Aslynda öýe gitmeli
Everyone should agree.	Hemmeler razy bolmaly.

I care about you.	Men sen hakda alada edýärin.
Why? 	Näme üçin?
We have to go with him.	Biz onuň bilen gitmeli.
I've heard all about it	Men bu hakda hemme zady eşitdim
I don't know what happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilemok.
Everyone wants one.	Her kim birini isleýär.
It looks like this to me.	Maňa edil şonuň ýaly görünýär.
It's too short.	Bu gaty gysga.
He did it, and he did it.	Ol muny etdi, ol hem etdi.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
I can't take it anymore	Indi alyp bilemok
It's too bad.	Ol gaty erbet.
No big deal for them.	Olar üçin uly mesele ýok.
It will be.	Bu bolar .
I didn’t have to suggest that	Men muny teklip etmeli däldim
Not often.	Köplenç däl.
He will return.	Ol gaýdyp geler.
The time was short.	Wagt gysga boldy.
No one paid attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa üns bermedi.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
He was not stupid.	Ol samsyk däldi.
He was not there.	Ol ýerde ýokdy.
No one seemed to mind.	Hiç kim muňa garşy däl ýalydy.
I have confessed many things to you before.	Men ozal size köp zady boýun aldym.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
That's right.	Ol dogry.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu meniň üçin gaty zerur.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
I thought maybe everything would be fine	Belki hemme zat gowy bolup biler diýip pikir etdim
He calls me there.	Ol ýerde maňa jaň edýär.
He is still here.	Ol henizem şu ýerde.
This is good for them.	Bu olar üçin gowy.
This is very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal.
I don't know, that's a very good question.	Bilmedim, bu gaty gowy sorag.
That's what makes a great person.	Ine, ajaýyp adam edýär.
In fact, he did not.	Aslynda ol beýle etmedi.
I want to do what he wants	Men onuň isleýän zadyny etmek isleýärin
I don't believe that	Men muňa ynanamok
I had no problem	Mende hiç hili mesele ýokdy
I will never be	Men hiç wagt bolmaz
I didn't really think you could	Aslynda sen bolup biler öýdemokdym
This is interesting to me.	Bu meniň üçin gyzykly bir zat.
Not really.	Aslynda dogry däl.
I want to see you	Men seni görmek isleýärin
You have to do more.	Has köp zat etmeli.
You have to let him know what is going on	Bolýan zatlary oňa habar bermeli
And then there would be time for him.	Soň bolsa oňa wagt bolardy.
How bad is that.	Bu nähili erbet.
He is not coming back.	Ol gaýdyp gelenok.
I didn’t want to hurt him	Men oňa zyýan bermek islemedim
There should be more.	Has köp zat bolmaly.
I think it would be good	Gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I did a lot of work today.	Bu gün köp iş etdim.
I told her not to do that	Men oňa beýle etmeli däldigini aýtdym
I really need to offer to help her	Men hakykatdanam oňa kömek etmegi teklip etmeli
So you have to do more.	Şonuň üçin has köp zat etmeli.
I didn't think so	Men muny pikir etmedim
He did it right.	Dogry etdi.
I have not always been like that	Men hemişe beýle däldim
I knew nothing about him	Men ol hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
We can only ask so many questions.	Diňe köp sorag berip bileris.
I'm not that smart	Men beýle akylly däl
And then everything is fine, but.	Soň bolsa hemme zat gowy, ýöne.
I will always be there	Men elmydama şol ýerde bolaryn
There is a year.	Bir ýyl bar.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
These are two songs.	Bu iki aýdym.
I didn't think about it	Men bu hakda hiç zat pikir etmedim
I had to.	Men etmeli boldum.
I was not ready for that	Men muňa taýyn däldim
I can't take it anymore	Men ony indi alyp bilemok
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
He was not now.	Ol häzir däldi.
He couldn't do anything else because he didn't know anything else.	Başga hiç zat edip bilmedi, sebäbi başga zady bilmeýärdi.
I think it will be good.	Gowy bolar öýdýän.
Thinking about it.	Muny pikir etmek.
You know, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Gowy we gowy bilýärsiň, bu beýle däl.
You have the answer	Size jogap bar
I can't say a word to you	Men saňa bir söz aýdyp biljek däl
I did not know	Bilmedim
This is not very interesting	Bu gaty gyzykly däl
I never thought it would happen.	Munuň boljakdygyny asla pikir etmedim.
Time is of the essence.	Wagt hiç zat däl.
We are not.	Biz beýle däl.
I want a girl	Men bir gyz isleýärin
In fact, it seems to me that this is true.	Aslynda, bu maňa dogry ýaly görünýär.
It started this week.	Ol şu hepde başlady.
It won't even be that hard.	Bu hatda beýle kyn hem bolmaz.
It was a strange day.	Geň gün boldy.
I am really happy for you	Men siziň üçin hakykatdanam bagtly
I told you this morning	Men size şu gün irden aýtdym
I have to be like everyone else	Men hemmeler ýaly bolmaly
This or that way.	Bu ýa-da başga bir ýol.
I think that's it	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şol
Oh, something else.	Aý, başga bir zat.
It's only been a week.	Bu diňe bir hepde.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
I want to do well here	Bu ýerde gowy etmek isleýärin
I didn't need it	Men oňa mätäç däldim
Just two words.	Diňe iki söz.
There is a good reason for this.	Munuň üçin gowy sebäbi bar.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Okay, he knew he wasn't.	Bolýar, ol özüniň däldigini bilýärdi.
Good job	Gowy iş.
In fact, I'm not sure he would do that	Aslynda onuň muny etjekdigine ynanamok
I believe now.	Men häzir ynanýaryn.
It's really hard.	Hakykatdanam gaty kyn.
These things.	Bu zatlar.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu ýalňyşlyk boldy.
We need a reason.	Bize bir sebäp gerek.
This is not a book.	Bu kitap däl.
He seemed to be doing well and well.	Ol hem gowy, hem gowy iş eden ýalydy.
He knows all about us.	Ol biz hakda hemme zady bilýär.
About time.	Wagt hakda.
I didn't have that.	Mende beýle däldi.
I always have fun there.	Men ol ýerde elmydama hezil edýärin.
I want to be close to you	Men size ýakyn bolmak isleýärin
I just can't think of one	Men diňe beýle pikir edip bilemok
I didn't know how to do it	Muny nädip etmelidigimi bilmedim
I need it	Maňa gerek
What happened to him?	Oňa näme boldy?
Of course not now.	Elbetde, häzir däl.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
This morning	Şu gün irden.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
This is a very serious matter.	Bu gaty çynlakaý mesele.
It will no longer be.	Ol indi bolmaz.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
I just can't help you	Men diňe size kömek edip bilemok
I haven't seen it in years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri görmedim.
This can go away.	Bu gidip biler.
I made the right decision	Dogry karar berdim
Something would happen.	Bir zat bolardy.
Only there.	Diňe şol ýerde.
You have to pay attention.	Üns bermeli.
I can't take anything anymore	Indi hiç zat alyp bilemok
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
I didn't do it to hurt you.	Men saňa zyýan bermek üçin etmedim.
You are a completely different person.	Sen düýbünden başga adam.
Because it's not fun.	Sebäbi bu gyzykly däl.
I can't be with you	Men seniň bilen bolup bilemok
To be fair.	Dogry bolmagy üçin.
I am just me.	Men diňe men.
I just thought about myself	Men diňe özüm hakda pikir etdim
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
That would be a huge mistake.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk bolar.
He is everywhere.	Ol hemme ýerde.
I have to do something.	Men bir zat etmeli.
I could only get it	Men diňe alyp bilýärdim
I don't think so	Bu pikir kän däldi öýdýän
No one paid attention.	Hiç kim üns bermedi.
It's hard for me.	Men muňa kyn.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
So there is really no right or wrong.	Şonuň üçin hakykatdanam dogry ýa-da ýalňyşlyk ýok.
That could be good news for us.	Bu bolsa biziň üçin gowy habar bolup biler.
Enough about money.	Pul hakda ýeterlik.
I'm not ready for the word.	Men söz bilen taýyn däl.
I have to be there for you.	Men seni ol ýerde bolmaly.
There are such things.	Şeýle zatlar bar.
Of course he wants to talk to you.	Elbetde, siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýär.
Tell me what happened.	Saňa näme bolandygyny aýdyň.
I need it here	Maňa şu ýerde gerek
I want to think about this and you	Bu we sen hakda pikir etmek isleýärin
I have seen this several times.	Men muny birnäçe gezek gördüm.
I really think it will help you	Hakykatdanam size kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin
This man came.	Bu adam geldi.
Concerned neo-hippies and their global warming, i'll tell ya.	Elbetde alada etmek, ýöne köp adam üçin.
I have come a long way.	Men gaty köp ýol aldym.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I thought it was impossible.	Mümkin däl diýip pikir etdim.
At that time.	Şol wagt.
It wasn't too bad.	Bu gaty erbet däldi.
Speak quickly.	Çalt aýdyň.
Everyone is great.	Hemmeler ajaýyp.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
I think they are great	Meniň pikirimçe, olar gaty gowy
It may be possible.	Mümkinçilik bolup biler.
I never saw it.	Men muny hiç haçan görmedim.
It’s hard to go anywhere anymore.	Mundan beýläk hiç ýere gitmek kyn.
There are not many questions and answers	Köp sorag we jogap ýok
Actually three.	Aslynda üç.
I've already thought about it	Men eýýäm bu barada pikir etdim
Of course, there was nothing he could do.	Elbetde, edip biljek zady ýokdy.
We can't call him.	Biz oňa jaň edip bilmeris.
I doubt it could be.	Mümkin bolup biljekdigine şübhelenýärin.
This is very strange.	Bu zat gaty geň.
I can't make you happy	Men seni bagtly edip bilemok
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolar.
You are there.	Sen şol ýerde.
They are not time.	Olar wagt däl.
Now nothing hurt.	Indi hiç zat zyýan bermedi.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I have never seen anything like this before.	Munuň ýaly zady öň görmedim.
It can help.	Kömek edip biler.
Of course, this was not me.	Elbetde, bu men däldim.
I need everything	Maňa hemme zat gerek
I can't think of anything else.	Başga pikir edip bilemok.
I want to be with him	Men onuň bilen bile bolmak isleýärin
It could be great.	Ajaýyp bolup biler.
I never thought about it that much.	Hiç haçan bu hakda kän pikir etmedim.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
He said he did.	Ol hakykatdanam şeýle etdi diýdi.
I thought about it, okay	Bu hakda pikir etdim, bolýar
I was not that person	Men ol adam däldim
No more.	Indi ýok.
You have to get it.	Muny almaly.
What a stupid thought.	Nähili samsyk pikir.
He will do the right thing with her.	Ol onuň bilen dogry eder.
Okay, today is such a day for you.	Bolýar, bu gün siziň üçin şeýle gün.
Something else came to my mind.	Maňa başga bir zat geldi.
I just can't seem to care	Men diňe özüm hakda alada edip bilemok
I think it's just talk.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu diňe gürleşmek.
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle erbet däldi
I had to go for help	Kömek üçin gitmeli boldum
He did not tell anyone.	Ol hiç kime aýtmady.
There is nothing wrong with that	Bu ýerde gaty ajaýyp zat ýok
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
Often he is right.	Köplenç dogry aýdýar.
I haven't been like this in a while	Birnäçe wagt bäri beýle däldim
This is not a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat däl.
Without you	Sen sen
You have to be right.	Dogry bolmaly.
I called him	Men oňa jaň etdim
I'm thinking of saying that	Muny aýtmak hakda pikir edýärin
I don't think that's possible	Bu mümkin däl diýip pikir edýärin
I think they are also very beautiful and beautiful	Meniň pikirimçe, olar hem gaty owadan we owadan
I don't think so anymore.	Indi beýle pikir etmeýärin.
If anyone can, we can.	Kimdir biri edip bilýän bolsa, edip bileris.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
No one is going to help me.	Hiç kim maňa kömek etjek däl.
.	.
I want to be close to him	Men oňa ýakyn bolmak isleýärin
I really hope so	Aslynda şeýle bolar diýip umyt edýärin
She came home to her first home.	Ilkinji öýüne täze öýüne geldi.
There was no one else to think about at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda pikir edip biljek başga hiç kim ýokdy.
And then it got harder.	Soň bolsa has kyn boldy.
This will be the case	Bu şeýle bolar
He told me, too, but not now.	Ol hem maňa aýtdy, ýöne häzir däl.
Oh, there's something else.	Aý, ýene bir zat bar.
I didn't want to talk to them about anything	Men olar bilen hiç zat hakda gürleşmek islemedim
He tells you what he thinks	Ol size näme hakda pikir edýändigini aýdýar
Not good.	Gowy däl.
Nothing is required here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat hökman däl.
There is still something here.	Bu ýerde henizem bir zat bar.
Isn't that something? 	Bu bir zat dälmi?
I heard about them.	Men olar hakda eşitdim.
I'm not good	Men gowy däl
He could only return home.	Ol diňe öýüne gaýdyp bilýärdi.
Oh, it can't be.	Aý, bolup bilmez.
I was very close to him	Men oňa gaty ýakyn boldum
It would be great for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty gowy bolardy.
I couldn't say a word.	Men bir söz aýdyp bilmedim.
I have a happy idea.	Bagtly pikir bar.
She was not a girl.	Ol gyz däldi.
I didn't have to do that	Muny etmeli däldim
I don’t know what that could be	Munuň näme bolup biljekdigini bilemok
Neither of them could do anything.	Ikisi-de hiç zat edip bilmedi.
I have so much	Mende gaty köp zat bar
I couldn't really tell.	Aslynda aýdyp bilmedim.
I know he's crazy about you	Men onuň sen hakda däli bolandygyny bilýärin
One of the three things.	Üç zadyň biri.
The reason is life.	Sebäp durmuş.
I can say that it happened	Munuň bolandygyny aýdyp bilerin
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
We just need a little more time.	Bize diňe biraz köp wagt gerek.
I do.	Men şeýle edýärin.
We need to rest.	Biz dynç almaly.
I knew he knew the truth	Men onuň hakykaty bilýändigini bilýärdim
The song is great.	Aýdym gaty gowy.
She is beautiful.	Ol owadan.
He couldn't do it anymore.	Ol muny indi edip bilmedi.
It's supposed to be this morning.	Şu gün irden bolmaly.
This time there is no problem.	Bu gezek hiç hili mesele ýok.
I could still tell he wasn't here	Men henizem onuň bu ýerde däldigini aýdyp bilýärdim
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
In fact, he did.	Aslynda aldy.
Stupid, he told himself.	Samsyk, özüne aýtdy.
I think someone told him.	Kimdir biri oňa aýtdy öýdýän.
This is not the only option.	Bu ýeke-täk mümkinçilik däl.
This is not the case for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin beýle däl.
This man was trying to destroy it.	Bu adam muny ýok etjek boldy.
It's very difficult.	Gaty kyn.
I could not see anything immediately	Men derrew hiç zady görüp bilmedim
It's time to dump her and move on.	Şol wagt indi we şu ýerde.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I want something better.	Men has gowy zat isleýärin.
It will come tomorrow.	Ertir geler.
I didn't know what he was doing together.	Bilelikde näme edenini bilmedim.
This time it's closer.	Bu gezek has ýakyn.
I know what happened	Näme bolandygyny bilýärin
He was with me.	Ol meniň bilen boldy.
It will be tomorrow.	Ertir bolar.
I didn't think twice	Iki gezek pikir etmedim
There is something for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin bir zat bar.
I must have thought about it myself	Men ol hakda özüm hakda pikir eden bolmaly
You have nothing to do.	Seniň etjek zadyň ýok.
I couldn't do that to him.	Men oňa muny edip bilmedim.
Time to time.	Wagt wagt.
I haven’t done that in years	Birnäçe ýyl bäri beýle etmedim
What happened	Näme boldy?
This is the first time I've seen him	Men ony ilkinji gezek gördüm
He has to.	Ol etmeli.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
This is indeed true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry.
We can decide in the morning.	Irden karar berip bileris.
I couldn’t be happier for him	Men onuň üçin has bagtly bolup bilmedim
Not everyone can do that.	Hemmeler muny edip bilenok.
He did.	Ol şeýle etdi.
I didn't want to think about something bad	Erbet bir zat hakda pikir etmek islemedim
I want to go home	Men öýe gitmek isleýärin
The problem is there.	Mesele şol ýerde.
You have to be there tomorrow	Ertir gün ol ýerde bolmaly
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
I never had to borrow	Men hiç wagt karz almaly däldim
He was right again.	Ol ýene dogry aýtdy.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
This is indeed the case.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle.
The question is close.	Sorag ýakyn.
I didn't see that.	Men muny görmedim.
Where is he	Ol nirede.
I'm somewhere else	Men başga ýerde
This is a problem.	Bu bir mesele.
Now they have a short week.	Häzir olar gysga bir hepde.
I can't say anything else.	Men başga zat aýdyp biljek däl.
Now there are two.	Indi ikisi bar.
The clock was not there.	Sagat ol ýerde däldi.
There are also a few here.	Şeýle hem bu ýerde ýerde birnäçe bar.
He was alone.	Ol ýeke boldy.
I said no, but it's a lie	Etmeýändigini aýtdym, ýöne ýalan
I do this a lot myself.	Men muny özüm köp edýärin.
Another asked.	Başga biri sorady.
Another tip from me.	Menden başga bir maslahat.
In fact, it is easier said than done.	Aslynda bu aňsat iş.
Everyone does that.	Her kim şeýle edýär.
I couldn't do anything else	Başga zat edip bilmedim
You don't have to go crazy.	Bu däli gitmek hökman däl.
That's how I get it.	Men ony şeýle alyp bilerin.
He didn't think about it at the time.	Ol şol wagt bu barada pikir etmedi.
I think it's too far.	Bu gaty uzak diýip pikir edýärin.
I think there is enough now	Meniň pikirimçe, indi ýeterlik zatlar bar
You don't have to worry	Alada etmeli däl
Maybe you should really go now.	Belki hakykatdanam indi gitmeli.
That would be something.	Bu bir zat bolardy.
He’s not a guy who doesn’t know what he’s doing.	Ol näme edýändigini bilmeýän ýigit däl.
It was fast.	Çalt boldy.
I think it was great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy boldy.
Of course he does.	Elbetde şeýle edýär.
This is not for them.	Bu olar üçin däl.
I tried.	Synap gördüm.
He likes me.	Ol meni halaýar.
It can't be.	Ol bolup bilmez.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Haýyş edýärin, haýsy ýyl.
It was not a happy life.	Bu bagtly durmuş däldi.
I think he must have known that	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny bilýän bolmaly
I want to keep myself busy	Özümi meşgul etmek isleýärin
You know, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Munuň hiç zat däldigini bilýärsiň.
I know it's not true.	Dogry däldigini bilýärin.
I didn't know that	Munuň beýle däldigini bilmedim
This is good.	Bu gowy.
Also more money.	Şeýle hem has köp pul.
This is not something new.	Bu täze zat ýaly däl.
I will do this often	Men muny köplenç ederin
Required.	Gerek.
I have already said a lot	Men eýýäm köp zat aýtdym
I only saw it yesterday	Men ony diňe düýn gördüm
I didn't see it then.	Men ol wagt görmedim.
Someone else has to do something else	Başga biri başga işi etmeli
A few bad months, a few good months	Birnäçe erbet aý, birnäçe gowy aý
I can't do that	Men muny edip bilemok
I want to be human again	Men ýene adam bolmak isleýärin
This road is not enough !!!.	Bu ýol ýeterlik däl !!!.
He was surprised to see me.	Ol meni görüp geň galdy.
He seemed to be gone.	Ol ýok ýalydy.
I just want to talk to you	Men diňe siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
I can't think of another reason	Başga bir sebäp hakda pikir edip bilemok
Absolutely right.	Elbetde dogry.
He will need more.	Oňa has köp zat gerek bolar.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
It didn't seem like a good idea to me.	Meniň üçin gowy pikir ýaly däldi.
I don't know anything	Men hiç zady bilemok
The worst.	Iň erbet.
It looks stupid, but.	Bu samsyk ýaly görünýär, ýöne.
I really did.	Men hakykatdanam etdim.
I knew it was going to happen someday	Munuň bir gün boljakdygyny bilýärdim
I just thought about myself.	Men diňe özüm hakda pikir etdim.
It helps a lot.	Ol gaty kömek edýär.
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle etmeli däl
Maybe not there yet.	Belki, entek ol ýerde ýok.
He is a man.	Ol adam.
No call time.	Jaň wagty ýok.
I just couldn't go	Diňe gidip bilmedim
Several times.	Birnäçe gezek.
This is for me.	Bu meniň üçin.
I have already admitted this	Men muny eýýäm boýun aldym
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hökman däl
It was not fun.	Bu gyzykly däldi.
You can get it.	Muny alyp bilersiňiz.
I had to get it now	Indi almaly boldum
I can only be with them	Men diňe olar bilen bolup bilerin
He wanted to know what he could do about them.	Ol olar hakda näme edip biljekdigini bilmek isledi.
I think that will be the case	Meniň pikirimçe, edil şonuň ýaly bolar
You have to do the right thing.	Dogry bir zat etmeli.
I've never done that before.	Men ozal beýle zady etmedim.
I think you can do that	Muny edip bilersiňiz diýip pikir edýärin
He couldn't sleep that night.	Şol gije uklap bilmedi.
You have to take a lot.	Köp zat almaly.
Maybe he didn’t do it in a short time.	Belki, gysga wagtda etmedi.
That's not good either.	Bu hem beýle gowy däl.
It's hard to tell him anything.	Oňa hiç zat aýtmak kyn.
I was in the right place	Men dogry ýerde boldum
Who are you	Bu sen kim
I had to tell him.	Men oňa aýtmaly boldum.
I visited him several times	Men oňa birnäçe gezek baryp gördüm
I didn't care about myself	Özüm hakda alada etmedim
He did not do so that day.	Şol gün ol muny etmedi.
I have not been home for several days	Birnäçe gün bäri öýde däldim
He had to give.	Ol bermeli boldy.
Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
That seemed strange.	Bu geň ýalydy.
There is no such way.	Munuň ýaly ýol ýok.
I thought so.	Men şeýle pikir etdim.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
I wanted to do something good.	Gowy bir zat etjek boldum.
He told me.	Ol maňa aýtdy.
I got good news.	Gowy habar aldym.
You can really tell.	Hakykatdanam aýdyp bilersiňiz.
He said he knew.	Bilýändigini aýtdy.
Of course, if he did, he wouldn't mind	Elbetde, beýle eden bolsa, garşy bolmaz
Probably for money.	Mümkin pul üçin.
There is no way.	Asla ýol ýok.
There are two reasons.	Iki sebäbi bar.
This is a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý mesele.
I can give him whatever he wants	Men oňa islän zadyny berip bilerin
It really does happen.	Bu hakykatdanam bolýar.
I can't see anything about it	Men ol hakda hiç zat görüp bilemok
I was not alone	Men ýeke däldim
So everything seems strange to him.	Şonuň üçin hemme zat edil özi ýaly geň görünýär.
Not much.	Kän däl.
It can't be much fun.	Kän gyzykly bolup bilmez.
Indeed, it already exists.	Hakykatdanam, eýýäm bar.
What did he do?	Ol näme etdi?
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň üçin ýeke-täk zat.
And it doesn't look like anyone is trying to help.	We hiç kimiň kömek etjek bolýan ýaly däl.
Great book.	Ajaýyp kitap.
I couldn't tell what he was thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini aýdyp bilmedim
I think he should take me.	Meniň pikirimçe, meni alyp gitmeli.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
He destroyed it.	Ol ony ýok etdi.
Full.	Doly.
It just doesn't seem right to me.	Bu diňe maňa dogry däl ýaly.
Which will be.	Haýsy bolar.
I had to go to work at the time	Şol wagt işe gitmeli boldum
I did it once.	Men muny bir gezek etdim.
Oh, but he did.	Aý, ýöne etdi.
This is a problem.	Bu bir mesele.
I haven't seen anyone seriously for a long time	Köp wagt bäri hiç kimi çynlakaý görmedim
You must have seen this.	Muny gören bolmaly.
He is also good.	Ol hem gowy.
Here	Bu ýerde.
No one seems to be home right now.	Häzirki wagtda hiç kim öýde däl ýaly.
I thought.	Men pikir etdim.
I don’t like it here or there	Men bu ýerde ýa-da ol ýerde halamok
I never know	Men hiç wagt bilemok
I have to get one	Men birini almaly
Of course.	Elbetde.
He didn't care.	Oňa alada etmedi.
He doesn't think so.	Ol beýle pikir etmeýär.
I haven't seen anything bad	Erbet bir zat görmedim
I think he is.	Men ol diýip pikir edýärin.
He voted against her.	Oňa garşy ses berdi.
Another guy.	Başga bir ýigit.
I heard it once.	Men ony bir gezek eşitdim.
I was so stupid	Men gaty samsyk boldum
I couldn't think of it	Men bu hakda pikir edip bilmedim
I want to be right	Dogry etmek isleýärin
There is nothing new there.	Ol ýerde täze zat ýok.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
It seems impossible.	Mümkin däl ýaly.
It didn't seem right to me.	Bu meniň üçin dogry iş ýaly däldi.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
He was still with me.	Ol henizem meniň bilen boldy.
Too much.	Gaty köp zat.
Not really.	Hakykatdanam beýle däl.
This is not just for me.	Bu diňe meniň üçin däl.
I don't know what happened to him	Onuň bilen näme bolandygyny bilemok
They are for everyone.	Olar hemmeler üçin.
I can be here for you.	Men bu ýerde siziň üçin bolup bilerin.
I have never thought of such a thing.	Mesele hakda beýle pikir görmedim.
I answered.	Men jogap berdim.
It's always been a challenge for me.	Bu meniň üçin elmydama kyn zat.
This is interesting for working hours.	Bu iş wagty üçin gyzykly.
I think that's right	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry ýaly
He didn't give much.	Kän bermedi.
Will definitely be back.	Elbetde gaýdyp geler.
Really and really gone.	Hakykatdanam we hakykatdanam gitdi.
He thought it was great.	Gaty gowy diýip pikir etdi.
Nothing was enough for him.	Oňa hiç zat ýeterlik däldi.
There was no chance for one.	Biri üçin mümkinçilik ýokdy.
I knew it was for me	Munuň meniň üçin bolandygyny bilýärdim
It took two weeks.	Iki hepde gerek boldy.
He knew he could do it.	Edip biljekdigini bilýärdi.
I thought fast.	Men çalt pikir etdim.
It's hard to call.	Jaň etmek kyn.
They and we have.	Olar we biz bar.
You are so beautiful	Siz gaty ajaýyp
He immediately went there.	Ol derrew şol ýere gitdi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
That's what he knows.	Bu onuň bilýän zady.
Then it will be a lie.	Soň bolsa ýalan bolar.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
Well, not very smart.	Gowy, gaty akylly däl.
She looks really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy ýaly.
He said he did.	Ol şeýle edendigini aýtdy.
There was no way.	Asla ýol ýokdy.
We are both young.	Ikimizem ýaş.
The sun.	Gün.
I almost did that.	Men muny diýen ýaly etdim.
Something went wrong.	Bir ýerde ýalňyşlyk boldy.
I thought about it a lot	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim
You are very fast	Siz gaty çalt
I still think it's gone	Henizem ýok boldy öýdýän
It's not good to be there.	Ol ýerde bolmagy gowy däl.
I need more time.	Maňa has köp wagt gerek.
That's the way it is.	Şeýle bolýar.
A little younger road.	Biraz ýaş ýol.

Of course it was.	Elbetde şeýle boldy.
He hoped so.	Ol şeýle umyt etdi.
You can tell it will happen.	Boljakdygyny aýdyp bilersiňiz.
It was like a girl for him.	Bu onuň üçin gyz ýalydy.
I can't do it right now	Men edil şu wagt edip bilemok
I doubt that.	Men muňa şübhelenýärin.
No one knows.	Muny hiç kim bilenok.
I often won't	Men köplenç bolmaz
I am not happy every day	Men her gün bagtly däl
I'm not with you	Men seniň bilen däl.
I saw something from you	Men senden bir zat gördüm
It was really crazy for us.	Bu, biziň üçin hakykatdanam däli boldy.
I promised him	Men oňa söz berdim
Mine! 	Meniň!
I want to make it very fast, if possible.	Mümkin bolsa, muny gaty çalt etmek isleýärin.
I trust you	Men saňa ynanýaryn
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
No one knew he was here.	Hiç kim onuň şu ýerde bolandygyny bilmeýärdi.
I can't see the bad thing	Erbet zady görüp bilemok
This seems very strange.	Bu gaty geň görünýär.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
I'm bad	Men erbet
I can't get it	Men muny alyp bilemok
Too many.	Gaty köp.
Okay, okay, that's not right.	Bolýar, bolýar, bu dogry däl.
He did not agree.	Ol muňa razy däldi.
He said more.	Ol has köp zat aýtdy.
I think they are ready now	Meniň pikirimçe, olar häzir taýyn
We will need a few things.	Bize birnäçe zat gerek bolar.
There is the right person.	Dogry adam bar.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
You are mine	Sen meniň.
I immediately agreed	Men derrew razy boldum
It was not a happy sound.	Bu bagtly ses däldi.
I am absolutely fine	Men düýbünden gowy
I'm not ready for that yet	Men entek muňa taýyn däldim
I want to do something	Men bir zat etmek isleýärin
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
You, me, everyone.	Sen, men, hemmeler.
Of course it can.	Elbetde bolup biler.
At home and with him.	Öýde we onuň bilen.
Good.	Gowy.
It was not a bad word.	Erbet söz däldi.
This is not for me.	Bu meniň üçin däl.
I think you'll have to buy us something	Bize bir zat satyn almaly bolarsyňyz öýdýärin
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
He could do nothing for me.	Ol maňa hiç zat edip bilmedi.
I'm fine.	Men gowy.
I wondered why he did that	Näme üçin beýle etdi diýip pikir etdim
I think you can do better.	Has gowy edip bilersiňiz diýip pikir edýärin.
There is no answer to that.	Muňa jogap ýok.
I have to agree, yes	Men razy bolmaly, şeýle
Must be the last.	Iň soňky bolmaly.
He stayed for that.	Ol munuň üçin galdy.
That would be great.	Bu gaty akylly bolardy.
I could not say anything	Men hiç zat aýdyp bilmedim
I have never been there	Men ol ýere hiç wagt baryp görmedim
You are one thing	Sen bir zat.
We need.	Biz zerur.
Seriously.	Çynlakaý.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.

He began to be human.	Ol adam bolup başlady.
This is every day.	Bu her gün.
How was he?	Ol nähili boldy.
It may take some time, but it can be done.	Birneme wagt gerek bolup biler, ýöne edip bolar.
It will be at home tomorrow.	Ertir öýde bolar.
I think you're something else	Meniň pikirimçe sen başga zat
I'll be crazy about you	Men sen hakda däli bolaryn.
I didn't need to talk.	Maňa gürleşmek gerek däldi.
It's been two years now.	Indi iki ýyl.
I could go alone.	Men ýeke özüm gidip bilýärdim.
I couldn't do these things	Men bu zatlary edip bilmedim
Strange here.	Bu ýerde geň.
This can take longer.	Bu has köp wagt alyp biler.
She can't go home.	Öýüne baryp bilmeýär.
I think he did.	Meniň pikirimçe, şeýle etdi.
The last time I saw him	Men onuň bilen iň soňky gezek gördüm
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
Big mistake with an adult	Uly adam bilen uly ýalňyşlyk
I don't need it anymore	Maňa indi gerek däl
I immediately got one	Men derrew birini aldym
I don't like anything about you	Men sen hakda hiç zat halamok
I loved it	Men muny gaty gowy gördüm
You just have to do it for a week.	Diňe bir hepde etmeli.
I have something to tell you	Men saňa bir zat aýtmaly
Not a word, nothing is nothing.	Bir söz däl, hiç zat hiç zat däl.
I couldn't do anything myself.	Özümi hiç zat edip bilmedim.
I thought it would be interesting.	Gyzykly bolar öýdüpdim.
I didn’t really care about money	Men hakykatdanam pul hakda alada etmedim
I wonder what it will be like	Onuň nähili boljakdygyna haýran
Well, nothing great.	Gowy, ajaýyp zat ýok.
He thought I did.	Men pikir etdim diýip pikir etdi.
In fact, I had nothing else to do.	Hakykatdanam, meniň etmeli başga zadym ýokdy.
It's beautiful.	Bu owadan.
I don't know what happened to me	Mende näme bolandygyny bilemok
Good, good.	Gowy, gowy.
I want to destroy it	Men ony ýok etmek isleýärin
He decided to take her away immediately.	Derrew alyp gitmek kararyna geldi.
I took another and did the same	Başga birini alyp, şol bir zady etdim
There seems to be no reason.	Sebäbi ýok ýaly.
I didn't think I would.	Men bolaryn öýdemokdym.
I can give you what you need	Size zerur zatlary berip bilerin
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I can't see no one	Hiç kimiň ýokdugyny görüp bilemok
The answer is bad.	Jogap erbet.
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat.
I don't think so at all	Men asla hiç zat pikir etmeýärin
He gave her advice and great ideas.	Oňa maslahat we ajaýyp pikir berdi.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
That was not really the case.	Hakykatdanam beýle däldi.
There was something more difficult about you.	Sen hakda has kyn zat bardy.
I thought it was weird	Bu geň zat diýip pikir etdim
That's right.	Bu dogry.
This will be really frustrating.	Bu hakykatdanam biynjalyk bolar.
That was not really the case.	Ol aslynda beýle däldi.
This is not the case with life.	Durmuş üçin beýle zat däl.
Coming back tomorrow	Ertir gaýdyp gelýär
You have to rest.	Dynç almaly.
I think he knew.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol bilýärdi.
Here he comes.	Ine, ol gelýär.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
I could not see	Men görüp bilmedim
It was good for us.	Bu biziň üçin gowy boldy.
She is very serious.	Ol gaty çynlakaý.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I can't say for tomorrow	Ertir üçin aýdyp biljek däl
Just do something.	Diňe bir zatlar et.
He was home again.	Ol ýene öýde boldy.
I want to do that	Muny etmek isleýärin
Somewhere, maybe, but never together.	Bir ýerde, belki, ýöne hiç haçan bilelikde bolmaz.
I was a little quick	Men birneme çalt boldum
I really had.	Mende hakykatdanam bardy.
I know it will happen	Boljakdygyny bilýärin
He said he did.	Ol muny edendigini aýtdy.
I saw no other way.	Başga ýol görmedim.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
He is not a serious person.	Ol çynlakaý adam däl.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle etmedi.
He knew it, he knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi, muny bilýärdi.
He could always say the right thing.	Elmydama dogry zady aýdyp bilýärdi.
It was new to me.	Bu meniň üçin täze boldy.

I am everything you have	Men seniň bar zadyň

I was like that.	Men şeýle boldum.
I know that, and he knows it	Men muny bilýärin we ol bilýär
And then there was another good idea.	Soň bolsa, başga bir gowy pikir bardy.
I can't do this anymore	Indi bu işi edip bilemok
I think there is a possibility	Mümkinçilik bar diýip pikir edýärin
You may be right.	Dogry aýdyp bilersiňiz.
I actually cared about you	Aslynda sen hakda alada etdim
It will be difficult.	Kyn bolar.
He only did it twice.	Diňe iki gezek etdi.
I always thought.	Men hemişe pikir etdim.
Then things got really fast.	Soň zatlar gaty çalt boldy.
There is a book somewhere.	Ol ýerde bir ýerde kitap bar.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
I'll take care of it today.	Men bu gün alada ederin.
I didn’t even do that	Men hatda muny etmedim
I knew it was going to be good	Men onuň gowy boljakdygyny bilýärdim
It also seemed like a good life to me.	Bu hem meniň üçin gowy durmuş ýalydy.
I'm ready for it	Men muňa taýyn boldum
I thought it was fun	Gaty hezil diýip pikir etdim
He is the man he wants.	Ol isleýän adam.
I have to go	Men gitmeli
I don’t think that’s bad.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu erbet däl.
I really know	Hakykatdanam bilýärin
Knowing you shouldn't.	Etmeli däldigini bilmek.
I knew it was for me	Munuň meniň üçin bardygyny bilýärdim
Seriously, just like that.	Çynlakaý, edil şonuň ýaly.
Really far away	Hakykatdanam gaty uzak
I didn't see anyone	Men hiç kimi görmedim
I'll be fine for nothing	Men hiç zat üçin gowy bolaryn
I was not ready for that	Men muňa taýyn däldim
This is work.	Bu iş.
Not a bad thing at all.	Hiç haçan erbet zat däl.
There was nothing else I could do.	Başga edip biljek başga zady ýokdy.
I knew he wanted to do something else	Başga zatlar etmek isleýändigini bilýärdim
Only.	Diňe.
Someone is smart.	Biri akylly.
I need your help	Maňa kömek etmegine mätäç
The problem is, it's too long to visit every week.	Mesele, her hepde baryp görmek üçin gaty uzak.
Maybe it will be good.	Belki gowy bolar.
I can see so much	Men şeýle köp zady görüp bilýärin
It didn't work out.	Hiç hili ýol bermedi.
I can't think of anyone else	Başga hiç kim hakda pikir edip bilemok
This is also true.	Bu hem dogry.
He will be there too.	Ol hem şol ýerde bolar.
Tell me what it was like for you.	Siziň üçin nähili bolandygyny aýdyň.

New life together	Bilelikde täze durmuş
He doesn't know anything else.	Başga zady bilmeýär.

Actually a lot like you.	Aslynda seniň ýaly köp zat.
There was no one else.	Başga biri ýokdy.
You must have seen this.	Muny gören bolmaly.

I thought this was a good idea	Bu gowy pikir diýip pikir etdim
What does this do?	Bu näme edýär.
Not many people can.	Köp adam edip bilmeýär.
I did nothing	Men hiç zat etmedim
I think that's a good idea	Bu gaty gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin
No one is perfect.	Hiç kim doly däl.
It's great, but it's still not human.	Bu gaty gowy, ýöne henizem adam däl.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
This book.	Bu kitap.

Everything worries me.	Hemme zat meni biynjalyk edýär.
They are so beautiful.	Olar gaty owadan.
Of course you can.	Elbetde edip bilersiňiz.
I'm not sure anyone would do that	Hiç kimiň muny etjekdigine ynanamok
He could be a guy.	Ol ýigit bolup biler.
I can't say enough about his work	Men onuň işi hakda ýeterlik zat aýdyp biljek däl
I couldn't make you happy	Men seni bagtly edip bilmedim
It wasn't that close.	Ol beýle ýakyn wagty däldi.

He thought.	Ol, pikir etdi.
No one there said anything about his work.	Ol ýerde hiç kim onuň işi barada bir zat aýtmady.
That's the way it is.	Ine, şeýle bolar.
Nothing bad.	Erbet zat ýok.

You are not alone	Sen ýeke däl
He did not want to leave.	Ol gitmek islemedi.
There will be no other way.	Munuň üçin başga ýol bolmaz.
She is also a good girl.	Ol hem gowy gyz.

He did it right.	Dogry etdi.
Now it will be something.	Indi bu bir zat bolar.
It helped a lot.	Bu köp kömek etdi.
I don't think that's a big deal.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu beýle uly mesele däl.

Let me know.	Maňa habar bermek.

This is not a question.	Bu ýerde sorag däl.

Maybe for a good reason.	Belki, gowy sebäp bilen.
This must be for me.	Bu meniň üçin bolmaly.
For a while I didn’t see anyone there	Biraz wagt ol ýerde hiç kimi görmedim

Only one night here.	Diňe şu ýerde bir gije.
I think that could be a big deal	Meniň pikirimçe, uly bir mesele bolup biler

He said no and left.	Ol ýok diýdi we gitdi.
I know everything about him	Men ol hakda hemme zady bilýärin
I was not in a good place.	Men gowy ýerde däldim.
A man picked it up and took it away.	Bir adam ony alyp, alyp gitdi.
He did not want to know it himself.	Muny özi bilmek islemedi.
So this is another book.	Şonuň üçin bu başga bir kitap.
No one can take it from me.	Hiç kim muny menden alyp bilmez.
I'll have to do something about it	Men bu barada bir zat etmeli bolaryn
Worst thing to see.	Görmek üçin iň erbet zat.
I think he really tells the truth	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hakykatdanam hakykaty aýdýar

Good.	Gowy.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.

There could be a better way.	Has gowy ýol bolup biler.
It may be possible.	Mümkin bolup biler.
I hoped it could be someone.	Kimdir biri bolup biler diýip umyt etdim.
There is worse news.	Has erbet habar bar.
It was great to see her again.	Ony ýene görmek gaty gowy boldy.
I still didn't know anything	Men henizem hiç zady bilmeýärdim
I never wanted to hurt him	Men oňa hiç wagt zyýan bermek islemedim
Tell me something about the future.	Geljek hakda bir zat aýdyň.
I think she is beautiful	Meniň pikirimçe, ol owadan
I haven't been there in a while	Birnäçe wagt bäri ol ýerde däldim
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.

And now it is.	Indi bolsa şeýle.

You are as many as I am	Sen meniň ýaly köp
Of course I couldn't	Elbetde edip bilmedim
They are also large.	Olar hem uly.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.

I am stupid, very stupid	Men samsyk, gaty samsyk

The next thing.	Indiki zat.
Tip.	Maslahat.

You can do a lot of good things.	Siz köp gowy zatlar edip bilersiňiz.
Two hours of fun!	Iki sagat hezil!

I want to go by myself	Özüm gitmek isleýärin
I couldn't sleep	Men uklap bilmedim
I didn't really think so.	Aslynda beýle pikir etmedim.
There was no reason to go home.	Öýe gitmäge hiç hili sebäp ýokdy.
He couldn't tell, he didn't want to know.	Ol aýdyp bilmedi, bilmek islemedi.
I really didn't	Mende hakykatdanam ýokdy
You have to tell me what happened.	Näme bolandygyny maňa aýtmaly.

I couldn't say how	Nädip aýdyp bilmedim
There was once.	Bir gezek bardy.

The clock is bad.	Sagat erbet.

Maybe so, maybe not.	Belki şeýle, belki ýok.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilenok.

That is no longer the case.	Munuň indi beýle däldigini.
This time something else happened.	Bu gezek başga bir zat boldy.
He said he didn't want one.	Birini islemeýändigini aýtdy.

This is what keeps him busy.	Bu bolsa ony meşgul edýär.
I couldn't do that to him	Men oňa muny edip bilmedim
I was not ready for that	Men muňa taýyn däldim
I did very well there	Men ol ýerde gaty gowy etdim
I'm thinking of doing something right now	Men häzir bir iş etmek hakda pikir edýärin
I could not answer immediately	Men derrew jogap berip bilmedim
I thought it would be great	Bu gaty gowy bolar diýip pikir etdim
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
In fact, there may be someone there.	Aslynda, ol ýerde kimdir biri bolup biler.
I thought something short could happen.	Gysga bir zat bolup biler öýdüpdim.
Now it's too late.	Indi ol gijä galdy.
This is the best thing that ever happened to him.	Bu onuň bilen bolup geçen iň gowy zat.
I think he might be somewhere	Men onuň bu ýerde bir ýerde bolmagy ähtimal
I hope one day he can do it with everyone.	Bir gün muny hemmeler bilen edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
There was nothing else.	Başga zat ýokdy.
Not much, but at home.	Kän däl, ýöne öýde.
in fact i'm so happy now !!.	aslynda men indi gaty bagtly !!.
I think that's a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
The answer was immediate.	Jogap derrew boldy.
The problem is there.	Mesele şol ýerde.
I didn't think so, but it really is	Beýle bolar öýdemokdym, ýöne hakykatdanam şeýle
You and me	Sen we men.
She is worried about something.	Ol bir zat hakda alada edýär.
He wants to.	Ol isleýär.
I never wanted to hurt him	Men oňa hiç wagt zyýan bermek islemedim
And then he did it again.	Soň bolsa ýene etdi.
I gave it to the police	Men polisiýa berdim
I think it will take some time	Oňa biraz wagt gerek diýip pikir edýärin
He called you.	Ol saňa jaň etdi.
I'm not short at all	Men asla gysga däl
No one can take that.	Hiç kim muny alyp bilmez.
That's the way life is.	Durmuş şeýle.
I bought it for a year	Bir ýyl satyn aldym
What happened was never enough.	Bolýan zatlar hiç wagt ýeterlik däldi.
It actually looks great.	Aslynda gaty gowy ýaly.
Of course, the issue is different.	Elbetde, mesele başga bir zat.
I think it would be great	Ajaýyp bolardy diýip pikir edýärin
This is not a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat däl.
It was not like that before.	Ol ozal beýle däldi.
I heard you	Men seni eşitdim.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
You don't have to tell me that	Saňa muny aýtmak hökman däl
I can do better for you	Men saňa has gowy edip bilerin
Of course, there is no such thing.	Elbetde, beýle zat ýok.
There is something else there.	Ol ýerde başga bir zat bar.
Who can say such a thing.	Kim beýle zady aýdyp biler.
He could tell her something and he did it.	Oňa bir zat aýdyp bilýärdi we etdi.
It's money.	Bu pul.
I knew something had happened	Bir zadyň bolandygyny bilýärdim
She worries about something, but she doesn't want to talk about it.	Ol bir zat hakda alada edýär, ýöne bu hakda gürleşmek islemeýär.
I heard another voice, this time closer	Başga bir ses eşitdim, bu gezek has ýakyn
I hope it will be interesting	Gyzykly bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I heard about it this morning	Bu hakda şu gün irden eşitdim
He started again.	Ol ýene başlady.
I know, that's a bad thing.	Bilýän, bu gaty erbet zat.
I could not go to him	Men oňa baryp bilmedim
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe şeýle.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
Maybe not.	Belki, belki ýok.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He once offered.	Bir gezek ol teklip etdi.
I have a lot to go	Meniň gitmeli köp zadym bar
I think that might be the idea for me.	Bu meniň üçin pikir bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
She can't answer him	Ol oňa jogap berip bilmeýär
Then it will be in the next place.	Soň bolsa indiki ýerde bolar.
It could be, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Bolup biler "-diýdi.
It should be the same.	Şeýle hem bolmaly.
I hope this is not the case	Munuň sebäbi däl diýip umyt edýärin
Why	Näme üçin .
He would be quick and smart.	Ol çalt we akylly bolardy.
That decision was wrong.	Bu karar ýalňyşlyk boldy.
In fact, it was not bad.	Aslynda bu erbet däldi.
I think it could be someone else	Başga biri bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin
No tonight.	Bu gije ýok.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
How bad for him.	Onuň üçin nähili erbet.
You have to be responsible for everything.	Hemme zat üçin jogap bermeli.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, bu hakda gaty ajaýyp zat.
It seemed like a lot.	Bu birneme kän ýalydy.
It must be.	Bu hökman bolmaly.
He called himself.	Ol özüne jaň etdi.
You don't have a good answer	Size gowy jogap ýok
It's too early.	Bu entek ir.
I didn't know he could do that.	Onuň beýle zat edip biljekdigini bilmeýärdim.
I had a great time	Mende gaty ajaýyp wagt boldy
He is still there.	Ol henizem şol ýerde.
I couldn't do it again	Men muny ýene edip bilmedim
I can see you	Men seniň bilen görüp bilýärin
He knew he was not right.	Dogry pikir etmeýändigini bilýärdi.
I don't think I'm wrong.	Mende hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok öýdemok.
I'm there, man.	Men şol ýerde, adam.
I never knew	Men asla bilmeýärdim
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
He tried to help her.	Oňa kömek etjek boldy.
Let me tell you - it was a scary place	Meni sorag etmek islemeýändigini aýdyp bilerin
No one but me was good.	Menden başga hiç kim maňa gowy däldi.
He did not.	Ol bermedi.
Now everything is different.	Häzir hemme zat başga.
That's the way it is	Edil şonuň ýaly
I think that's a good thing	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin
I was crazy about him	Men ol hakda däli boldum
I thought we were great together	Biz bilelikde ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim
I thought that might be the case.	Munuň şeýle bolmagy mümkin diýip pikir etdim.
I don't have to.	Men hökman däl.
It's good, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Gowy "-diýdi.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda bu şeýle.
I can't see anymore	Indi görüp bilemok
I think that's possible	Bu mümkin diýip pikir edýärin
I decided it would be a bad call	Erbet jaň boljakdygyna karar berdim
I really don't know how	Hakykatdanam nädip bilemok
I'm not stupid at all	Men düýbünden samsyk däl
I can't be beautiful	Men owadan bolup bilemok
There was no sound.	Ses ýokdy.
Of course he can.	Elbetde edip biler.
Everyone is here.	Hemmeler şu ýerde.
The man could no longer go home.	Adam, indi öýe baryp bilmedi.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
He did not think of such things.	Ol beýle zatlar hakda pikir etmedi.
I just have to get the money	Men diňe pul almaly
I wanted to suggest this	Men muny teklip etjek boldum
There is a question.	Bir sorag bar.
Of course, that was not the case.	Elbetde, bu dogry däldi.
I'm talking about it.	Men bu barada.
One thing for sure.	Munuň üçin bir zat.
Money, money, money	Pul, pul, pul
You have to do it now.	Indi etmeli.
I couldn't be happier	Men hakykatdanam bagtly bolup bilmedim
Not good enough.	Gowy ýeterlik däl.
And for some as a baby gets older, he or she will outgrow this.	Bu hem biziň üçin birnäçe gün boldy.
I thought it was a bad call	Erbet jaň diýip pikir etdim
I got the money	Men pul aldym
I don't think any words are bad.	Hiç hili söz erbet däl öýdemok.
I didn't need attention	Maňa üns gerek däldi
This way, this way.	Bu ýol, şu ýol.
I need someone to help me	Maňa kömek etjek biri gerek
Long time no see	Kän wagt.
Maybe you should be ready to go	Mümkin, gitmäge taýyn bolmaly
I promised him.	Men oňa söz berdim.
Okay, here.	Bolýar, şu ýerde.
It's you	Bu sen
I am happier now	Men häzir has bagtly
Not enough yet.	Entek ýeterlik bolmaz.
I want to, but.	Men isleýärin, ýöne.
Maybe the only thing.	Belki ýekeje zat.
You can do good or bad.	Gowy ýa-da erbet edip bolýar.
Another, then another.	Başga biri, soň ýene biri.
This is crazy.	Bu däli.
I can give you everything here	Bu ýerde size hemme zady berip bilerin
In your opinion, this is very strange.	Siziň pikiriňizçe bu gaty geň.
I really need a break	Maňa hakykatdanam dynç gerek
He had no qualms.	Onuň hiç hili hili hili ýokdy.
For a while.	Birneme wagt bäri.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I thought one would be enough	Biri ýeterlik bolar öýdüpdim
No news, bad news.	Habar ýok, erbet habar.
I hope he only calls one day	Diňe bir gün jaň eder diýip umyt edýärin
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
He is absolutely right.	Ol düýbünden dogry.
I did not know	Bilmedim
Everyone is here.	Hemmeler bu ýerde.
I think maybe.	Mümkin diýip pikir edýärin.
I couldn't do it before.	Men ozal edip bilmedim.
Some kind of message	Bir hili habar
I can't do anything else	Başga bir zat edip bilemok
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu men bolmaly.
Several people came	Birnäçe adam geldi
I never wanted to go	Men hiç haçan gitmek islemedim
This is a difficult decision.	Bu kyn karar.
I can't think.	Men pikir edip bilemok.
Everyone.	Her kim.
They may be faster than you.	Olar senden has çalt bolup biler.
It's not that bad.	Ol beýle erbet däl.
Not in my opinion.	Mende däl, pikir.
That is what happened to them.	Olar üçin bu şeýle boldy.
Must be somewhere in the house.	Öýde bir ýerde bolmaly.
I can't do anything for them	Men olar üçin hiç zat edip bilemok
He said he could not.	Edip bilmejekdigini aýtdy.
He wanted to do it himself.	Muny özi etmek isledi.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
That may be enough for both of us.	Diňe ikimiz üçin ýeterlik bolup biler.
I advised that it would be better this morning.	Şu gün irden gowy boljakdygyny maslahat berdim.
He's another guy.	Ol başga ýigit.
I have never seen anything like it.	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim.
I have not tried this again.	Men muny ýene synap görmedim.
You don't have to take it.	Muny almak hökman däl.
It's really hard.	Aslynda beýle kyn.
I thought it would be good.	Gowy bolar öýdüpdim.
I didn't think so.	Men bu hakda beýle pikir etmedim.
Sorry, that's not the case.	Bagyşlaň, beýle däl.
A lot of people started this	Köp adam muňa başlady
No one can take it.	Hiç kim alyp bilmez.
I didn't know it existed	Men onuň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
Life is not like that.	Durmuş beýle däl.
Just wonderful	Diňe ajaýyp
I knew that.	Muny gowy bilýärdim.
This song is for you	Bu aýdym siziň üçin
I was a little nervous	Men birneme biynjalyk boldum
Everyone is there.	Hemmeler şol ýerde.
He didn't want to.	Ol muny islemedi.
Maybe he can help her.	Belki, oňa kömek edip biler.
So interesting.	Şeýle gyzykly.
Of course, something came out.	Elbetde, bir zat çykdy.
You don't have to take long.	Kän wagt almaly däl.
You don't have to do that	Muny etmeli däl
What can I do for this? 	Munuň üçin näme edip bilerin?
I hope it will be easy for you today	Bu gün siziň üçin aňsat bolar diýip umyt edýärin
There are three ideas.	Üç pikir bar.
You have to call	Jaň etmeli
I didn't think so	Men muny pikir etmedim
He had no time for me.	Onuň meniň üçin ýok wagty ýokdy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
It's hard to say.	Söz bilen aýtmak kyn.
This happens to me.	Bu meniň bilen bolýar.
Not a bad night alone	Diňe bir gije erbet däl
He wants to know what happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilmek isleýär.
I do not want to answer immediately	Derrew jogap bermek islämok
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
I'm scared.	Men gorkýaryn.
He was not going to do it again.	Ol muny ýene etjek däldi.
I can only recommend the first two.	Diňe ilkinji ikisi hakda maslahat berip bilerin.
It's just young.	Bu diňe ýaş.
It was a good life for us here.	Bu ýerde biziň üçin gowy durmuş boldy.
I couldn't even answer	Men hatda jogap berip bilmedim
I didn't see it that way.	Men ony beýle görmedim.
Then everything went bad.	Soň hemme zat erbet boldy.
You have to pay attention.	Üns bermeli.
It may seem too fast.	Bu gaty çalt ýaly bolup biler.
I thought it was so beautiful	Bu gaty owadan diýip pikir etdim
You have to decide.	Karar bermeli.
I still think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, henizem şeýle.
One question.	Bir sorag.
Maybe nothing.	Belki hiç zat däl.
You don't have to do that.	Şeýle etmeli däl.
I think it would be good	Gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
No one answered him.	Hiç kim oňa jogap bermedi.
He had a lot of time.	Onuň köp wagty bardy.
Probably.	Mümkin.
I didn't need anything else	Maňa başga zat gerek däldi
We can do that here too.	Bu ýerde hem edip bileris.
He had a job for me.	Onuň meniň üçin işi bardy.
I can't tell you more	Men saňa has köp zat aýdyp biljek däl
It was new at the time.	Şol wagt täze boldy.
Maybe you can make it better	Belki, ony has gowy edip bilersiňiz
She is beautiful.	Ol owadan.
He took me home.	Ol meni öýüne alyp gitdi.
I haven't thought about these things in months	Birnäçe aý bäri bu zatlar hakda pikir etmedim
Now he had to do something.	Indi ol bir zatlar etmeli boldy.
I do now.	Men häzir edýärin.
He can't get anything else.	Ol başga zady alyp bilmez.
I gave it to him.	Men oňa berdim.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
They are so beautiful.	Olar gaty owadan.
I really need it, man.	Maňa hakykatdanam gerek, adam.
Many were surprised	Köp adam geň galdy
It will always be possible	Mümkin hemişe bolar
I can't get it	Men muny alyp bilemok
I just want one thing and one thing	Men diňe bir zady we diňe bir zady isleýärin
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
Okay.	Bolýar.
He took it too hard or too far.	Ol muny gaty kyn ýa-da gaty uzak aldy.
Hours every day.	Her gün sagat.
Something else is great.	Uly başga zat.
I don’t want to do these things	Men bu zatlary etmek islämok
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
It may take some time.	Biraz wagt alyp biler.
Someone does that.	Kimdir biri muny edýär.
It takes time.	Wagt gerek.
I thought about it right away.	Bu derrew pikir etdim.
Of course not.	Elbetde, edil şonuň ýaly däl.
He knew this very well.	Ol muny gaty gowy bilýärdi.
Good, good, good.	Gowy, gowy, gowy.
Tell him for me.	Oňa meniň üçin aýdyň.
I didn't do well.	Gowy iş etmedim.
Good.	Gowy.
The song wasn’t too bad either.	Aýdym hem gaty erbet däldi.
This is certainly true.	Bu, elbetde, dogry.
I think it's beautiful	Bu owadan diýip pikir edýärin
Maybe not.	Belki beýle däldi.
Quick answer.	Çalt jogap.
It's not just me.	Muny diňe men däl.
He didn't answer, he left.	Ol jogap bermedi, ol gitdi.
I can't say anything else right now	Şu wagt başga zat aýdyp biljek däl
No one told me.	Hiç kim maňa aýtmady.
It's hard to see.	Görmek gaty kyn.
I didn’t do it for money	Men muny pul üçin etmedim
This is not an interesting idea.	Bu gyzykly pikir däl.
A year ago.	Bir ýyl mundan ozal.
This can be both good and bad.	Bu hem gowy, hem erbet zat bolup biler.
They were nothing.	Olar hiç zat däldi.
I know how good it will be	Munuň nähili gowy boljakdygyny bilýärin
Correct answer.	Dogry jogap.
Enjoy as you never know.	Hiç wagt bilmeýän ýaly lezzet.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
What happened	Bu näme boldy?
It wasn't smart.	Bu akylly däldi.
It would be an easy meal.	Ol aňsat nahar bolardy.
I think that's for sure	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hökman
I think he's big	Meniň pikirimçe, ol uly
It didn't hurt me.	Bu maňa zyýan berip bilmedi.
That's not enough for me.	Bu meniň üçin ýeterlik däl.
He asked her.	Ol oňa haýyş etdi.
That being said.	Muny aýdyp bolar.
Just one.	Diňe bir.
I've heard enough.	Men ýeterlik eşitdim.
It was not the right time.	Dogry wagt däldi.
I don't want it anymore	Indi islämok
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
This is indeed true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry.
I thought everything would be fine	Hemme zat gowy bolar öýdüpdim
We can't.	Biz edip bilmeris.
A lot of people like it.	Köp adam muny halaýar.
I don’t know if it still exists.	Entek bardygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny bilemok.
I actually thought there was nothing	Aslynda hiç zat ýok diýip pikir etdim
This will destroy it.	Bu ony ýok eder.
Two, no, three people.	Iki, ýok, üç adam.
For the first time.	Munuň üçin ilkinji gezek.
I thought it was something else	Başga bir zat diýip pikir etdim
There was another.	Başga biri bardy.
I've always been like that.	Men hemişe şeýle boldum.
I am the only one who can do that.	Muny edip biljek ýeke-täk men.
It won't be like that tomorrow.	Ertir beýle bolmaz.
I certainly do not.	Men hökman beýle etmeýärin.
The idea is here.	Pikir şu ýerde.
I'm glad to see you	Men sizi görüp begenýärin
Only good thing this time.	Diňe şu gezek gowy zat.
This is very difficult for me.	Bu meniň üçin düýbünden kyn.
I can't let that happen	Men muňa rugsat berip bilemok
So do what he has to do.	Şonuň üçin onuň etmeli zadyny etmek.
A lot for one person.	Bir adam üçin köp zat.
I already have it together.	Mende eýýäm bilelikde bar.
This is a great day for us.	Bu, biziň üçin uly gün.
They will not.	Olar bolmaz.
I'm in a good place now	Men häzir gowy ýerde
I don't know anything about that	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilemok
They are also numerous.	Şeýle hem olar köp.
He is very human.	Ol gaty adam.
I think so too.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hem şeýle.
Really have to go !!!.	Hakykatdanam gitmeli !!!.
I thought what happened	Näme boldy diýip pikir etdim
It's not about what it is.	Bu näme hakda däl.
He knows a lot.	Ol muny köp bilýär.
Great to see.	Görmek gaty gowy.
I think no one wants to	Hiç kim islemeýär öýdýän
I really couldn't say much	Men hakykatdanam kän zat aýdyp bilmedim
It's very close.	Bu gaty ýakyn.
This is nothing new.	Bu hakykatdanam täze zat däl.
This is not the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek däl.
Not really close.	Hakykatdanam ýakyn däl.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
Really a request, then a decision	Hakykatdanam haýyş, soň bolsa karar
I got a good answer	Gowy jogap aldym
Everything together	Hemme zat bilelikde.
Where to go	Nirä gitmeli

A lot of people came out here tonight.	Bu gije köp adam bu ýere çykdy.
The night had already arrived, and he was alone.	Gije eýýäm geldi, ol ýeke boldy.

I thought he was himself	Men onuň özi diýip pikir etdim
I care so much about you.	Men sen hakda gaty alada edýärin.
He also thought it might be interesting.	Şeýle hem gyzykly bolup biler diýip pikir etdi.
This is something else.	Bu başga zat.
The time was great.	Wagt gaty gowy boldy.
I think he knows, of course.	Elbetde, bilýär öýdýän.
I didn't have to	Men almaly däldim
He admitted this.	Muny boýun aldy.
I knew it could only happen	Munuň diňe bir zat bolup biljekdigini bilýärdim
I can't call the police	Men polisiýa jaň edip bilemok
He said no one was at home.	Öýde hiç kimiň ýokdugyny aýtdy.
Maybe not much, but.	Belki köp däl, ýöne.
I didn't need anyone	Maňa hiç kim gerek däldi
I know how that happened	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilýärin
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
It was not difficult.	Bu kyn däldi.
He didn't have to do that, and he knew it.	Muny etmek hökman däldi we ol muny bilýärdi.
I never called him	Men oňa asla jaň etmedim
I really need a job	Men işe gaty mätäç
Isn't that great?	Bu gaty uly dälmi?
Like a lot of things.	Köp zat ýaly.
Great	Ajaýyp.
I am the only one who can help him now	Häzir oňa kömek edip biljek ýeke-täk men
I was alone	Men ýeke boldum
In fact, it was not a big deal.	Aslynda bu kän bir iş däldi.
Of course, that was the problem.	Elbetde, bu mesele boldy.
He said it was good.	Ol gowy diýdi.
I have to be happy for him	Men onuň üçin bagtly bolmaly
He didn't say a word either.	Ol hem söz aýtmady.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, köp däl.
No one really paid attention.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam üns bermedi.
The news was not just bad.	Habar diňe erbet däldi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Must answer well.	Gowy jogap bermeli.
I didn't think it would be long	Uzak bolar öýdemokdym
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
That's how I really saw you	Men seni hakykatdanam şeýle gördüm
I couldn't see it.	Men ony görüp bilmedim.
That could be you	Bu siz bolup bilersiňiz
I had one	Mende bir gezek bardy
This time is different.	Bu wagt başga.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
No need anymore.	Indi zerur däl.
I think there were three	Meniň pikirimçe, üç boldy
I know this very well	Men muny gaty gowy bilýärin
The adult calls again.	Uly adam ýene jaň edýär.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I thought it was interesting	Bu gyzykly diýip pikir etdim
Someone else will.	Başga biri eder.
I can give it a try.	Synap görüp bilerin.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
This is, I think, a mistake.	Bu, meniň pikirimçe, ýalňyşlyk.
I told you once	Men saňa bir gezek aýtdym
That alone is not enough.	Munuň özi ýeterlik däl.
I don't know how it happened	Nädip bolandygyny bilemok
I need you	Size gerek bolmak isleýärin
I haven't seen him since this morning	Men ony irden bäri görmedim
I always want to give, give, give.	Hemişe bermek, bermek, bermek isleýärin.
I thought about it.	Men bu barada pikir etdim.
You have to do something for me.	Sen meniň üçin bir zat etmeli.
For a bad day.	Erbet gün üçin.
If necessary, you.	Gerek bolsa, siz.
Because it will be so.	Sebäbi şeýle bolar.
I'm not against it.	Men muňa garşy däl.
He must have thought about it before	Bu hakda öňem pikir eden bolmaly
I have to do it myself	Muny özüm etmeli
I helped with that	Munuň üçin kömek etdim
I thought it was really hard	Men hakykatdanam kyn diýip pikir etdim
I thought you were someone else	Men seni başga biri diýip pikir etdim
What would it be like for her.	Ol onuň üçin nähili bolardy.
If he is happy.	Bagtly bolsa.
I can only speak for myself	Men diňe özüm üçin gürläp bilerin
Only two, no more.	Diňe iki, indi ýok.
I just want to be.	Men diňe bolmak isleýärin.
Not for this reason.	Bu üçin däl.
I know a lot	Men köp zady bilýärin
Something different this time.	Bu gezek başga zat.
I can't do that to you	Men seni beýle edip bilemok
She makes it so beautiful.	Ol şeýle bir owadan edýär.
It will be.	Ol bolar.
It's been a long time coming.	Uzak wagt boldy.
I want to go by myself	Özüm gitmek isleýärin
Good job	Gowy iş
He will be mad.	Ol däli bolar.
I did not agree.	Men düýbünden razy däldim.
It was a long night for him.	Bu onuň üçin köp gije boldy.
The problem is not new.	Mesele täze däl.
You are not stupid	Sen samsyk däl
Too much for that.	Munuň üçin gaty köp.
I did something today	Şu gün bir zat etdim
I was there for a few days	Men ol ýerde birnäçe gün boldum
I didn't think he could do that	Men muny edip biler öýdemokdym
It would be harder now.	Bu indi has kyn bolardy.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
This has been a difficult day for us.	Bu, biziň üçin kyn gün boldy.
It's actually a big time.	Aslynda uly wagt.
This seems to me to be a mistake.	Bu maňa ýalňyşlyk ýaly bolup görünýär.
I never asked like you.	Hiç haçan seniň ýaly haýyş etmedim.
It was not such a big deal.	Bu beýle bir uly zat däldi.
I don't know what happened to that.	Munuň bilen näme bolandygyny bilemok.
I didn't have to worry	Meni alada etmeli däldi
You must have seen this too.	Muny hem gören bolmaly.
It was a great day.	Bu ajaýyp gün boldy.
he said.	' ol aýtdy.
This will not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaz.
They have to be there.	Olar şol ýerde bolmaly.
I'm sorry about that	Men oňa gynanýaryn
I just didn’t have to think about it.	Diňe bu hakda pikir etmeli däldim.
It's not hard to see.	Ony görmek kyn däl.
I'm fine with that	Men munuň bilen gaty gowy
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
I can't say what he thinks	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini aýdyp bilemok
I haven't been there in a while	Biraz wagt ol ýerde däldim
I'm sorry already	Men eýýäm bagyşlaň
You are there	Sen şol ýerde
Ses.	Ses.
She cares.	Ol özüni alada edýär.
It helps a lot.	Bu köp kömek edýär.
Not a bad thing.	Erbet zat däl.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
It was like that.	Munuň özi ýalydy.
It's a lot of people.	Bu köp adam.
He said this.	Ol muny aýtdy.
I am very young	Men gaty ýaş
Please	Haýyş edýärin
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
He said he could do it.	Ol muny edip biljekdigini aýtdy.
I can't believe it anymore	Indi muňa ynanamok
I could never do that	Men muny hiç haçan edip bilmedim
I wanted to do something	Men bir zatlar etjek boldum
I both saw and heard	Men ikimizem gördüm we eşitdim
I still have this problem	Mende henizem bu mesele bar
Maybe this will be all right.	Belki, bu hemme zat gowy bolar.
I don't think that's right.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry däl.
He is there now.	Häzir ol ýerde.
That would be something.	Bu bir zat bolardy.
Everything was for me.	Özüm üçin hemme zat bardy.
I think something else could happen	Başga bir zat bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin
Bad for us.	Biziň üçin erbet.
Bigger and better.	Uly we has gowy.
I don't think that's enough	Umyt ýeterlik däl diýip pikir edýärin
I can't go back to good work.	Gowy işe gaýdyp bilemok.
I found it very strange	Men muny gaty geň gördüm
I think we should go now	Meniň pikirimçe, indi gitmeli
I think about things	Men zatlar hakda pikir edýärin
You are there.	Sen şol ýerde.
I can't answer	Men jogap berip bilemok
I'm calling again.	Men ýene jaň edýärin.
I have to decide now	Men indi karar bermeli
This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
I need someone, that's what you want.	Maňa kimdir biri gerek, bu seniň isleýän zadyň.
Of course you are beautiful.	Elbetde sen owadan.
The last issue seems to be the issue here.	Soňky mesele şu ýerde mesele bolup görünýär.
I still couldn't say anything	Men henizem hiç zat aýdyp bilmedim
He didn't say much about it.	Ol bu hakda kän zat aýtmady.
I told you about it once	Men bu hakda size bir gezek aýtdym
Many people will agree.	Köp adam razy bolar.
With or without.	Bile ýa-da ýok.
I was not fast enough	Men ýeterlik çalt däldim
This is nothing.	Bu hiç zat däl.
It was the same.	Edil şonuň ýalydy.
I never want to be away from you	Men hiç wagt senden uzak bolmak islämok
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
Does anyone want to go?	Gitmek isleýän barmy?
I think the time is near	Meniň pikirimçe, wagty ýakyn
In fact, he did not want to do that.	Aslynda beýle etmek islemedi.
He wanted to do it.	Ol muny etjek boldy.
Not for us.	Biz üçin däl.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Munuň zerur däldigini bilýärdi.
I was good for one thing and one thing only	Men diňe bir zat we diňe bir zat üçin gowy boldum
Next year, maybe.	Geljek ýyl, belki.
No work.	Iş ýok.
It's something else.	Ol başga bir zat.
Who he is and who he is.	Ol kim we ol kim.
Help me here	Maňa şu ýerde kömek et
It was not easy for me.	Bu meniň üçin aňsat däldi.
The girl was right.	Gyz dogry aýtdy.
Not me, not you.	Menden däl, sen bolmaz.
I can't think of it now	Indi bu hakda pikir edip bilemok
I trust him more	Oňa has köp ynanýaryn
This is just a meal.	Bu diňe bir nahar.
He could not.	Ol edip bilmedi.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
I've always been like that	Men elmydama şeýle boldum
I didn't know it would be so hard for you	Siziň üçin gaty kyn boljakdygyny bilmedim
I think we can help you	Size kömek edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin
I can't give you everything	Men saňa hemme zady berip bilemok
Of course, this is the case.	Elbetde, bu mesele.
There was a good reason for that.	Munuň hem gowy sebäbi bardy.
I was there before.	Men öňem bardy.
I had something else	Başga bir zadym bardy
It was new to me	Bu meniň üçin täze boldy
This can be a challenge for him.	Bu onuň üçin kynçylyk bolup biler.
It would be nice, but not impossible.	Gowy bolardy, ýöne mümkin däl.
I haven't seen it in a long time	Köp wagt bäri görmedim
Do something that will make you happy.	Seni bagtly etjek bir zat et.
I was worried about that	Men bu barada alada etdim
I can't be destroyed	Meni ýok edip bolmaz
This is not fast.	Bu çalt däl.
It could be something else.	Munuň üçin başga bir zat bolup biler.
It's just that.	Bu diňe.
We have to be.	Biz bolmaly.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Mümkin, ýöne aňsat däl.
I didn’t have to agree to go with them	Olar bilen gitmäge razy bolmaly däldim
Nothing can happen to us	Bize hiç zat bolup bilmeýär
I don't want money	Men pul islämok
There was nothing to do anymore.	Indi etmeli iş ýokdy.
'.	'.
It didn't help at all.	Bu asla kömek etmedi.
We are both short.	Ikimizem gysga.
I knew he would be there	Men onuň şol ýerde boljakdygyny bilýärdim
It looks good on me.	Bu maňa gowy görünýär.
Doing the right thing.	Dogry etmek.
She is a very beautiful person.	Ol gaty owadan adam.
I know, there's a lot.	Bilýärin, köp zat bar.
I think he knows what he's doing	Näme edýändigini bilýär öýdýän
This is a job, just a job.	Bu bir iş, diňe bir iş.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
That would be worse.	Bu has erbet bolardy.
The reason for this is not clear.	Munuň sebäbi düýbünden aýdyň däl.
I don't think it's going to be easy	Bu aňsat bolmaz diýip pikir edýärin
I am happy today	Men şu gün bagtly
A few weeks.	Birnäçe hepde.
Who knew how long.	Kim näçe wagt bilýärdi.
I was not surprised	Men beýle geň görmedim
This will never happen.	Bu hiç haçan bolmaz.
He didn't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däldi.
There were three more with him.	Bu ýerde onuň bilen ýene üç adam bardy.
Not once, never.	Bir gezek däl, hiç wagt däl.
This word is a lie.	Bu söz ýalan.
Why? 	Näme üçin?
And then it's great.	Soň bolsa gaty gowy.
You are a person who is always and never is.	Siz hemişe we hiç wagt ýok adam.
I can do this	Men bu işi edip bilerin
He has many times	Ol köp gezek
I didn't want to answer him	Men oňa jogap bermek islemedim
It was crazy.	Bu däli boldy.
I must have done this a long time ago.	Men muny köp wagt öň eden bolmaly.
We are not.	Biz beýle däl.
It just exists.	Ol diňe bar.
I can't get it	Men muny alyp bilemok
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
Say it right.	Dogry aýdyň.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Dogry bolmak gaty gowy zat.
You may have the best answer.	Iň gowy jogap bolup bilersiňiz.
This is a big mistake	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk
I have several.	Mende birnäçe bar.
I know what he knows	Men onuň bilýän zadyny bilýärin
There is a reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi bar.
I knew it.	Men bu hakda bilýärdim.
He would have to go too.	Ol hem gitmeli bolardy.
We can really do that.	Hakykatdanam edip bileris.
I think he did.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şeýle etdi.
He knows what to do.	Näme etmelidigini biler.
It's easy and fun.	Bu aňsat we gyzykly.
He came out, he came out.	Ol çykdy, çykdy.
Just one day.	Diňe bir gün.
That's it.	Boldy et.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
They are there.	Olar şol ýerde.
I have to be there now	Men häzir ol ýerde bolmaly
I really don't care.	Men hakykatdanam bu barada alada edip bilemok.
I think he went somewhere	Meniň pikirimçe, ol nirä gitdi
I can be that way	Men şeýle bolup bilerin
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I decided	Men karar berdim
Everyone everyone.	Hemmeler hemmeler.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ol indi alyp bilmedi.
From work to work	Işden we işe
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
This is no one.	Bu hiç kim däl.
He had nothing to do.	Onuň edip biljek zady ýokdy.
It's good to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy zat.
I got one.	Birini aldym.
I knew what was in there	Men ol ýerde näme bardygyny bilýärdim
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki, olar üçin kyn.
I never wanted to hurt him	Men oňa hiç wagt zyýan bermek islemedim
I didn't really think so	Aslynda beýle pikir etmedim
Many people do.	Köp adam edýär.
I haven't seen you in a long time	Men seni köp wagt bäri görmedim
This, of course, is great for us.	Bu, elbetde, biziň üçin uly.
You can also get it.	Şeýle hem alyp bilersiňiz.
I totally agree.	Men doly razy.
Not everyone, no.	Hemmeler däl, ýok.
I hope he will be a better person.	Has gowy adam bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
I think it should be me	Meniň pikirimçe, bu men bolmaly
I told her I needed help	Men oňa kömek etmelidigini aýtdym
It was everywhere.	Hemme ýerde bardy.
I could not speak	Men gürläp bilmedim
I thought he liked you	Ol seni halaýar öýdüpdim
He doesn't have much.	Oňa kän zat ýok.
Thought and thought.	Pikir we pikir.
I can't offer it to you.	Men muny size teklip edip bilemok.
I was close to him	Men oňa ýakyn boldum
It's been a week.	Bu bir hepde boldy.
I didn’t want to hurt him	Men oňa zyýan bermek islemedim
I didn't do anything today	Bu gün hiç hili iş etmedim
I think something really could happen together	Hakykatdanam bilelikde bir zat bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin
What did he do?	Ol näme etdi.
He said it was not good.	Ol munuň gowy däldigini aýtdy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hakykatdanam iş.
Oh! 	Aý!
I really can't think	Men hakykatdanam pikir edip bilemok
Nothing good.	Gowy zat ýok.
I did everything alone	Men hemme zady ýeke etdim
He took the money.	Ol pul aldy.
That was not the case for us.	Bu biziň üçin beýle däldi.
It's harder to know now.	Muny indi bilmek has kyn.
Such a day	Şeýle gün.
I don't do that anymore	Indi beýle etmeýärin
I hope this helped you	Bu size kömek etdi diýip umyt edýärin
OK? 	Bolýar?
He is himself.	Ol özi.
I also think I should go tonight	Şeýle hem şu gije gitmeli diýip pikir edýärin
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ol indi alyp bilmedi.
You need time.	Size wagt gerek.
I thought about it tonight.	Men bu gije ol hakda pikir etdim.
I couldn’t love it so much	Men gaty gowy görüp bilmedim
I think that's it	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şol
I can love it now	Häzir gaty gowy görüp bilýärin
It's not just me.	Bu diňe menden däl.
It's very easy to do that.	Muny etmek gaty aňsat.
We can agree.	Razy bolup bileris.
Maybe not everything.	Belki hemme zat däl.
Good song.	Gowy aýdym.
He advised me.	Ol maňa maslahat berdi.
I know this may sound strange.	Munuň geň bolup biljekdigini bilýärin.
I believe that very much	Men muňa gaty ynanýaryn
He thought he should call the police	Ol polisiýa jaň etmeli diýip pikir etdi
I haven't seen him in a while.	Men ony birnäçe wagt bäri görmedim.
Everything was possible.	Hemme zat mümkin boldy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Really a little.	Hakykatdanam biraz.
He does a few other things.	Başga birnäçe zatlar edýär.
You have to go home.	Öýe gitmeli.
This idea comes to me.	Bu pikir maňa gelýär.
Can you help me?	Maňa kömek edip bilersiňizmi?
I was not very close	Men gaty ýakyn däldim
It looks better to me.	Maňa has gowy görünýär.
I don’t know if this thing exists or not.	Bu zadyň bardygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny bilemok.
He did the impossible.	Mümkin däl zady etdi.
I just have to be ready	Men diňe taýyn bolmaly
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Long time no see	Kän wagt.
Tonight is tomorrow and then tonight.	Bu gije ertir, soň bolsa şu gije.
He thought maybe anything could happen.	Belki hemme zat bolup biler diýip pikir etdi.
I can't help you much	Men size kän kömek edip bilemok
So here we are.	Şonuň üçin biz şu ýerde.
There should be more.	Has köp zat bolmaly.
It's been a long time coming.	Bu ýerde köp wagt bäri bar.
Way for him.	Onuň üçin ýol.
Probably not.	Mümkin ýa-da ýok.
I have nothing to do today	Bu gün meniň etjek zadym ýok
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
This is nothing.	Bu hiç zat däl.
I just have to tell you	Men diňe size aýtmaly
I've seen it twice now	Men muny indi iki gezek gördüm
It was a great time for everyone	Hemmeler üçin ajaýyp wagt boldy
I didn't have to call	Men jaň etmeli däldim
I don't know how.	Nädip bilemok.
You know that.	Muny bilersiňiz.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
No one knows what happened.	Näme bolandygyny hiç kim bilenok.
I didn’t know what that could be	Munuň näme bolup biljekdigini bilmeýärdim
To make her happy.	Ony bagtly etmek üçin.
I didn't need anything	Maňa hiç zat gerek däldi
There was nothing else that night.	Şol gije başga hiç zat ýok.
He can't do anything.	Hiç zat edip bilmez.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
It was a good day.	Gowy gün boldy.
She is a beautiful person.	Ol owadan adam.
I didn’t have to tell him these things	Men oňa bu zatlary aýtmaly däldim
No one paid much attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa kän bir üns bermedi.
You have to go.	Gitmeli.
Of course, a few years ago now.	Elbetde, indi birnäçe ýyl mundan ozal.
I doubt it will	Boljakdygyna şübhelenýärin
Now you have to do it.	Indi muny etmeli.
Of course, I knew he would do it	Elbetde, onuň etjekdigini bilýärdim
I think it takes a while	Meniň pikirimçe, ýeke wagt gerek
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Everything is beautiful.	Hemme zat owadan.
I thought whoever did it would come back	Muny kim eden bolsa, gaýdyp geler öýdüpdim
Okay.	Bolýar.
I did what he did.	Men onuň edenini etdim.
I think he's a handsome guy.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol owadan ýigit.
You can only call once.	Diňe bir gezek jaň edip bolýar.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
I didn’t want to hurt anyone	Men hiç kime zyýan bermek islemedim
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Belki, belki, belki.
This time he did it.	Bu gezek muny etdi.
That will be the case.	Şeýle bolar.
And still at home.	Öýde bolsa henizem.
She really enjoys it.	Ol hakykatdanam onuň bilen gaty hezil edýär.
Mon.	Sen.
This is just a matter of time.	Bu diňe bir mesele.
I really need it	Maňa hakykatdanam gerek
Really bad night.	Hakykatdanam erbet gije.
I never thought so.	Hiç wagt beýle pikir etmedim.
I think he is alone at home	Meniň pikirimçe, öýde ýeke bolýar
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
Really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy.
I only know this because he told me	Men muny diňe bilýärin, sebäbi ol maňa aýtdy
You know	Bilýärsiň.
I don't want to talk now.	Men häzir gürleşmek islämok.
I always do it in a new place	Men elmydama täze ýerde edýärin
A lot of guys, of course.	Elbetde, köp ýigit.
This is not possible	Bu mümkin däl
I did nothing wrong last night	Düýn agşam hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedim
Like this	Bu ýaly.
It seems impossible at all.	Asla mümkin däl ýaly.
I did nothing	Men hiç zat etmedim
Good.	Gowy.
A little too much.	Biraz köp.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň sebäbi boldy.
Not true with another suggestion.	Başga teklip bilen dogry däl.
You know he doesn't.	Onuň ýokdugyny bilýärsiň.
I saw the truth	Men hakykaty gördüm
Because it is impossible to exist.	Sebäbi munuň bar bolmagy mümkin däl.
I had nothing to do with it	Muny etjek zadym ýokdy
This is not possible	Bu mümkin däl
I saw it immediately	Men derrew gördüm
A lot of time for that.	Munuň üçin köp wagt.
It doesn't seem to be.	Beýle däl ýaly.
This is my own thing.	Bu meniň öz zadym.
I am no one	Men hiç kim däl
I can do almost anything here	Men bu ýerde hemme zady diýen ýaly edip bilerin
Gone are the days	Birnäçe gün ozal gitdi
There are two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar.
I still think about it	Men henizem bu hakda pikir edýärin
Three years ago.	Üç ýyl ozal.
He started very young.	Ol gaty ýaş başlady.
Of course not.	Elbetde ýok.
I didn't think about it	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim
These are great things.	Bu uly zatlar.
There.	Ol ýerde.
He could not be here.	Ol bu ýerde bolup bilmedi.
Now you	Indi sen.
Too big to talk to him.	Ol bilen gürleşmek üçin gaty uly.
Maybe not.	Belki ýok.
You have to be with them.	Olar bilen bile bolmaly.
It takes money.	Munuň üçin pul gerek.
I don’t know what that could be	Munuň näme bolup biljekdigini bilemok
This is also strange.	Bu hem geň.
I just have to do something	Men diňe bir zat etmeli
It's a lot of things together.	Bu bilelikde köp zat.
I don't want to be alone again	Men ýene ýeke bolmak islämok
A lot about nothing.	Hiç zat hakda köp zat.
I never want to hurt you	Men size hiç wagt zyýan bermek islämok
He is not.	Ol beýle däl.
It should be easy.	Aňsat bolmaly.
It will always be and always will be.	Elmydama bolar we hemişe bolar.
He knew.	Ol bilýärdi.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
That would be the case for many.	Köp adam üçin bu şeýle bolardy.
I shouldn't have been there	Men ol ýerde bolmaly däldim
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
It can be difficult for many people.	Köp adam üçin kyn bolup biler.
He is right this morning.	Ol şu gün irden gaty dogry aýdýar.
What's up	Näme bolýar?
He could not see.	Ol görüp bilmedi.
He lives there.	Ol ýerde ýaşaýar.
I'm with you here	Men şu ýerde seniň bilen
I didn't know he could do it	Edip biljekdigini bilmeýärdim
I hope this helps! 	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin! 
Of course, now we are both the same.	Elbetde, indi ikimizem bir.
There is no such thing as them.	Olar ýaly zat ýok.
I could sleep.	Men uklap bilýärdim.
A lot of money.	Pul köp.
He did the same.	Ol hem edil şonuň ýaly etdi.
Of course, everyone has the same opinion about their work.	Elbetde, her kimiň öz işi barada şol bir pikir bar.
I really think about it	Men hakykatdanam bu hakda pikir edýärin
I saw it.	Men ony gördüm.
Good.	Gowy.
So is he.	Ol hem şeýle.
He can do whatever he wants.	Islän zadyny edip biler.
He paid more attention to her.	Ol oňa has köp üns berdi.
I can't do that again	Men muny ýene edip bilemok
No one has done that before.	Mundan öň hiç kim muny etmedi.
Big.	Uly.
No one knew much about him.	Hiç kim ol hakda köp zat bilmeýärdi.
It looks beautiful, of course.	Elbetde, owadan görünýär.
It will be a long way for us.	Bu biziň üçin uzak ýol bolar.
All he had to do was rest and hope.	Ol diňe dynç almaly we umyt etmeli boldy.
I must have seen this earlier	Men muny has ir gören bolmaly
I think that's a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin.
You can't help it.	Oňa kömek edip bolmaz.
This is a very good thing for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy zat.
I knew it all day	Men muny bütin gün bilýärdim
The bar gave.	Bar berdi.
I think he's very crazy	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gaty däli
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
He did.	Ol şeýle etdi.
Me and you	Men we sen.
It was hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn boldy.
I have to leave tomorrow	Ertir ir gitmeli
It should be.	Bu bolmaly.
About when and what word.	Haçan we haýsy söz hakda.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Then three, then two.	Soň üç, soň iki.
I didn't know that	Men muny bilmeýärdim
He must have thought about it before	Bu hakda öňem pikir eden bolmaly
He is not coming.	Ol gelenok.
He didn't know what to think.	Ol onuň hakda näme pikir edýändigini bilmeýärdi.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
I can't give you anything anymore	Men saňa eýýäm bir zat berip bilemok
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
We have to tell you what really happened here.	Bu ýerde hakykatdanam näme bolandygyny bize aýtmaly.
I have a better way.	Mende has gowy ýol bar.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but it will be.	Belki şu gün däl, belki ertir däl, ýöne bolar.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
I don't want that at all	Men muny asla islämok
Of course, they are right.	Elbetde, olar dogry.
We can't do that anymore.	Indi edip bilmeris.
There seemed to be no problem.	Mesele ýok ýalydy.
I never did that	Men muny hiç haçan etmedim
Just like us, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Edil biziň ýaly "-diýdi.
I do this every morning	Men muny her gün irden edýärin
I don't really know that.	Men muny hakykatdanam bilemok.
I had no such thing	Mende beýle zat ýokdy
They agree.	Olar gaty razy.
I must	Men hökman
I only have one question	Mende diňe bir sorag bar
Same thing tomorrow.	Ertir şol bir zat.
I only know that this is not true	Munuň dogry däldigini diňe bilýärin
I don't believe that	Men muňa gaty ynanamok
He took me home.	Ol meni öýüne alyp gitdi.
There are other things out there.	Ol ýerde başga zatlar hem bar.
Why, he couldn't say.	Näme üçin, aýdyp bilmedi.
Okay.	Bolýar.

I want to do something really good	Men hakykatdanam gowy zady etmek isleýärin
Of course not.	Elbetde mümkin däl.
He didn't seem to need the money.	Oňa pul gerek däl ýalydy.
It's over now.	Indi boldy.
Ol.	Ol.
We can't.	Biz edip bilmeris.
He says he doesn't know.	Bilmeýändigini aýdýar.
Now that sounds really interesting.	Indi bu hakykatdanam gyzykly ýaly.
They are not there yet.	Olar entek ýok.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
You are either with him or against him.	Siz ýa-da onuň bilen, ýa-da oňa garşy.
Night.	Gije.
No one spoke.	Hiç kim söz aýtmady.
I want to do something	Men bir zat etmek isleýärin
He had nothing better to do.	Onuň has gowy etmeli zady ýokdy.
I know.	Men bilýärin.
I didn't know it existed	Munuň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
I am right here	Men şu ýerde dogry
It is also not necessary.	Şeýle hem zerur däl.
I felt like I was gone	Men ýok ýaly boldum
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
I could go.	Men gidip bilýärdim.
The short answer is yes.	Gysga jogap, şeýle boldy.
Big mistake	Uly ýalňyşlyk
Interesting.	Gyzykly.
I am completely happy.	Men doly bagtly.
Oh, great.	Aý, ajaýyp.
I thought he wanted it that way	Men muny şeýle isleýär öýdüpdim
Maybe it will come soon.	Belki, ýakyn wagtda geler.
In fact, I can't answer that	Aslynda men muňa jogap berip bilemok
Today I am one of them.	Bu gün onuň biri men.
There was no problem.	Kynçylyk ýokdy.
You can do this in a number of ways.	Muny birnäçe ýol bilen edip bilersiňiz.
It's as if he did what he was supposed to do.	Etjek bolýan zadyny hem eden ýaly.
Of course, that's just me.	Elbetde, bu diňe men.
I'm not the only one.	Men diňe beýle däl.
And then he didn't.	Soň bolsa etmedi.
All work.	Hemme iş.
Because it doesn't help anyone.	Sebäbi bu hiç kime kömek etmeýär.
He really said that.	Ol muny hakykatdanam aýtdy.
You have to rest.	Dynç almaly.
I want to do all this myself	Munuň hemmesini özüm etmek isleýärin
It is in a very difficult place.	Ol gaty kyn ýerde.
It looks very difficult now.	Häzir gaty kyn görünýär.
Okay.	Bolýar.
This should not be too difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolmaly däl.
Of course, not everywhere.	Elbetde, hemme ýerde däl.
Of course you can.	Elbetde edip bolar.
Tell me what to do.	Näme etmelidigimi aýdyň.
It was very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly boldy.

Good.	Gowy.
I don't know what happened there.	Ol ýerde näme bolandygyny bilemok.
I always need help	Maňa elmydama kömek gerek
Then he thought.	Soň bir pikir etdi.
I think everything is possible	Hemme zat mümkin diýip pikir edýärin
I have to tell you something about myself	Saňa özüm hakda bir zat aýtmaly
I have a strange request	Mende geň bir haýyş bar
You have to help.	Kömek etmeli.
Someone else.	Başga biri.
Now this is the worst.	Indi bu iň erbet.
Often this is very good.	Köplenç bu gaty gowy.
He did the right thing.	Ol dogry zady etdi.
Maybe it was too short.	Belki gaty gysga boldy.
No more police.	Indi polisiýa ýok.
They just need you right now.	Olar diňe şu wagt size mätäç.
I didn't want to do that again	Men muny ýene etmek islemedim
We can go or see it.	Biz gidip bileris ýa-da ony görüp bilersiňiz.
He didn't think about it.	Ol bu barada pikir etmedi.
This will help you.	Bu size kömek eder.
Now tell me.	Indi aýdyň.
I can't see it	Men muny görüp bilemok
I was not myself	Men özüm däldim
What else can we do?	Başga näme edip bileris?
The big thing is good.	Uly zat gowy.
I'm scared.	Men gorkýaryn.
He did not respond.	Ol muňa jogap bermedi.
I actually loved it	Aslynda gaty gowy gördüm
This seems strange.	Bu düýbünden geň görünýär.
It's been a while.	Birneme wagt boldy.
I don't want to do that myself.	Özümi beýle etmek islämok.
I think time is of the essence	Wagt şeýle diýip pikir edýärin
He didn't want to be there.	Ol ol ýerde islemedi.
I had only one opportunity and only one opportunity	Mende diňe bir mümkinçilik we diňe bir mümkinçilik bardy
No no no.	Ýok ýok ýok.
Just for the money.	Diňe pul üçin.
I have enough	Mende ýeterlik
I actually thought it was great.	Aslynda gaty gowy diýip pikir etdim.
He couldn't speak either.	Ol hem gürläp bilmedi.
I could tell him everything	Men oňa hemme zady aýdyp bilýärdim
Maybe he can do it now.	Belki, indi edip biler.
No it's not.	Ýok bu däl.
I had to do that for me	Muny meniň üçin etmeli boldum
I told you yesterday	Düýn saňa aýtdym
I don't know, man.	Bilmedim, adam.
He came home with the two of them.	Ol ikisi bilen öýüne geldi.
You didn't have to know that	Muny bilmek hökman däldi
Never.	Hiç haçan asla.
This is not complete yet.	Bu entek doly däl.
I know what he wants	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärin
I knew there was more to it	Munuň üçin has köp zadyň bardygyny bilýärdim
Absolutely ready to go.	Gitmäge düýbünden taýyn.
There was nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.
Bad, it started to go really well.	Erbet, bu hakykatdanam gowy gidip başlady.
No one knows what he's doing.	Hiç kim onuň näme edýändigini bilenok.
I think he wants to see me	Meniň pikirimçe, ol meni görmek isleýär
Of course, this is what happened to me.	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin şeýle boldy.
I can't do everything	Men hemme zady edip bilemok
Because he was still there.	Sebäbi ol henizem bardy.
It was so crazy	Bu gaty däli boldy
I want it very badly.	Men gaty erbet isleýärin.
As you know.	Bilýän ýaly.
It was great.	Gaty gowy boldy.
It's kind of weird.	Bu bir hili geň.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
I really need to relax for a while	Men hakykatdanam biraz wagt dynç almaly
Of course it is.	Elbetde şeýle.
I couldn't go to you	Men saňa baryp bilmedim
I didn't do that	Men muny etmedim
Why? 	Näme üçin?
Now I have to tell you	Indi saňa aýtmaly
I called three times yesterday	Düýn üç gezek jaň etdim
I didn't have to make you tonight	Men seni şu gije etmeli däldim
I don’t know why this happened.	Munuň näme üçin beýle bolandygyny bilemok.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
I think he knows what happened	Meniň pikirimçe, näme bolandygyny bilýär
I have to go already	Men eýýäm gitmeli
This is not a new idea.	Bu indi täze pikir däl.
It looks like this.	Ol şeýle görünýär.
Hours and hours every night.	Her gije sagat we sagat.
I was only one night for him	Men onuň üçin diňe bir gije boldum
He helped, but not enough.	Ol kömek etdi, ýöne ýeterlik däldi.
I think that's great.	Bu ajaýyp zat diýip pikir edýärin.
He can and will care.	Ol biler we alada eder.
He can't tell me enough about you.	Ol maňa sen hakda ýeterlik zat aýdyp bilmez.
I would like another watch	Maňa ýene bir sagat gerek bolar
For.	Üçin.
I want more	Mundan has köp zat isleýärin
He knew what he was doing that night.	Ol şol gije näme edýändigini bilýärdi.
Now you are here.	Indi sen şu ýerde.
He can do something else.	Başga bir zat ýaly edip biler.
This was not my thing.	Bu meniň zadym däldi.
This happens every year.	Bu her ýyl bolýar.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
I asked you to call if possible	Mümkin bolsa, size jaň etmegini haýyş etdim
Just to try things out.	Diňe zatlary synap görmek üçin.
I want a better life	Men has gowy durmuş isleýärin
Now I don't want to think about it	Indi bu hakda pikir etmek islemedim
I had to give him something	Men oňa bir zat bermeli boldum
I still couldn't love it	Men henizem ony gowy görüp bilmedim
And then he said that.	Soň bolsa muny aýtdy.
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
What a wonderful day.	Nähili ajaýyp gün.
I wish you all the best	Men siziň üçin has gowy isleýärin
I didn't think you could get it	Ony alyp bilersiňiz öýdemokdym
I didn't know what he was doing	Men onuň näme edenini bilmedim
Not much.	Kän däl.
Together to talk about it.	Bu barada gürleşmek üçin bilelikde.

Only once.	Diňe bir gezek.
There is only one word.	Diňe söz bar.
Now no one can harm us.	Indi hiç kim bize zyýan berip bilmez.
It may be possible.	Mümkin bolup biler.
Maybe one day he'll be back here.	Belki, bir gün ol bu ýere gaýdyp geler.
Couldn't go	Gidip bilmedi
In fact, there will be no time.	Hakykatdanam, wagt bolmaz.
Not anymore.	Indi däl.
You need great help.	Size uly kömek gerek.
He must be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolmaly.
A person must be completely or permanently absent	Adam düýbünden bolmaly ýa-da ýok bolmaly
They weren't necessarily.	Olar hökman däldi.
They or not.	Olar ýa-da başga zat däl.
Well, no big deal.	Gowy, uly mesele ýok.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
That money was nothing.	Bu pul hiç zat däldi.

Very bad idea.	Gaty erbet pikir.
He came home today.	Ol şu gün öýüne geldi.
I had to say something.	Men bir zat aýtmaly boldum.
There were only two.	Bu ýerde diňe ikisi bardy.
No one had called him before.	Ozal hiç kim oňa jaň etmedi.
He wanted to help.	Ol kömek etmek isledi.
It takes two.	Iki gerek.

I think both are gone.	Meniň pikirimçe, ikisi-de gitdi.
He could still be at home, but he could sleep.	Ol henizem öýde bolup bilýärdi, ýöne uklap bilýärdi.

I already called him	Men eýýäm oňa jaň etdim
Meat or will.	Et ýa-da eder.
We will not be far away.	Biz uzak bolmaz.
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle erbet däldi
I had to do it yesterday	Düýn etmeli boldum
I have to go to work	Men işe gitmeli
I know what he doesn't know	Men onuň bilmeýän zadyny bilýärin
I tried to call the police	Men polisiýa jaň etjek boldum
I'm happy about that.	Men muňa begenýärin.
Here and there.	Ine we şu ýerde.
We are still here.	Biz henizem şu ýerde.
That could be a good thing.	Bu gowy zat bolup biler.

We are so close now.	Biz häzir şeýle ýakyn.
This is a very difficult task.	Bu gaty kyn iş.
And then he did.	Soň bolsa etdi.
He didn't really know.	Ol hakykatdanam bilmeýärdi.
It will be everything, there will be no one else.	Ol hemme zat bolar, başga hiç kim bolmaz.
He said he would.	Etjekdigini aýtdy.
This is very clear.	Munuň özi gaty aýdyň.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
He couldn't think of anything.	Ol hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilmedi.
I only did this once.	Men muny diňe bir gezek etdim.
I know	Bilýän
It's actually worse.	Aslynda has erbet.
I don't know what day	Haýsy gün bilemok
Of course.	Elbetde.

You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe etmeli.
This is not necessarily a bad thing.	Bu hökman erbet zat däl.
I couldn't take a word	Men bir söz alyp bilmedim
To be great.	Uly bolmak üçin.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I did it yesterday and today	Düýn we şu gün etdim
I never saw him	Men ony hiç haçan görüp bilmedim
Which could be.	Haýsy bolup biler.
The last answer is a single word.	Iň soňky jogap ýekeje söz.
And great for us.	We biziň üçin ajaýyp.
It really did exist.	Hakykatdanam bardy.
I thought you might suggest something.	Belki bir zat teklip edip bilersiňiz diýip pikir etdim.
I didn't think much	Men kän pikir etmedim
I had to help her	Men oňa kömek etmeli boldum
He said there was nothing wrong with that.	Mende hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok diýdi.
It will help me.	Maňa kömek eder.

She was very impressed.	Oňa gaty haýran galdy.
I was not alone	Men beýle ýeke däldim
That alone cannot be the case.	Diňe beýle bolup bilmez.
He just comes.	Ol diňe gelýär.

I have never been able to give myself completely.	Men hiç wagt özümi doly berip bilmedim.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
I don't think so.	Men pikir etmeýärin.
We may never know which way it happened.	Haýsy ýol bilen bolup geçen bolsa, belki asla bilmeris.
I will help you.	Men size kömek etjek.
So there is no one.	Şonuň üçin hiç bir adam ýok.
I haven't seen him in a week	Men ony bir hepde bäri görmedim
I knew there was something strange about you	Sen hakda geň bir zadyň bardygyny bilýärdim
OK, that's right.	Bolýar, şeýle.

I don't know how.	Nädip bilemok.
It can't be you.	Bu sen bolup bilmez.
Is that so?	Bu şeýlemi?
They were not human.	Olar adam däldi.
It wasn't fast enough.	Ol ýeterlik çalt däldi.
There is never such a big man.	Hiç haçan beýle uly adam ýok.
Everything will help.	Hemme zat kömek eder.
At that time	Şol wagt
There was no other word for it.	Munuň üçin başga söz ýokdy.
Another way.	Başga ýol hem.
I think it will be interesting.	Gyzykly bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
This is good news.	Bu gowy habar.

I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
And then in the morning.	Soň bolsa irden.
One of the two things.	Iki zadyň biri.

No one.	Hiç kim ýok.
Isn't that possible?	Bu mümkin dälmi?
It took a while	Bu birneme wagt aldy
I can only say a lot.	Men diňe köp zady aýdyp bilerin.

What is this	Bu näme.
And then he did.	Soň bolsa etdi.

You have to agree.	Siz razy bolmaly.

You are a good person	Sen gowy adam
He didn't do it very well.	Ol muny gaty gowy etmedi.
Maybe he wants to upset me.	Belki, ol meni biynjalyk etmek isleýär.

This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
I wonder why he didn't.	Näme üçin bermedi diýip pikir edýärin.
I haven't seen it before.	Men ozal görmedim.
He was like a man.	Adam ýalydy.
He wondered why he shouldn't give it to her tonight.	Näme üçin bu gije oňa bermeli däl diýip pikir etdi.
He told me a lot about it.	Ol maňa bu hakda köp zat aýtdy.
He wanted, he wanted.	Ol isledi, isledi.
You have to go for a while	Biraz wagt gitmeli
I heard a loud noise	Gaty ses eşitdim

Police, maybe.	Polisiýa, belki.
Not just us, everyone.	Diňe biz däl, hemmeler.
We are not one.	Biz bir däl.

It can tell you a lot.	Saňa köp zat aýdyp biler.
It was good for him.	Bu oňa gowy geldi.
I thought it might be the last time.	Iň soňky gezek bolup biler diýip pikir etdim.
He doesn't care about you, he doesn't care about himself.	Ol sen hakda alada etmeýär, özi hakda alada etmeýär.
I'm happy, man.	Men bagtly, adam.
I called one night.	Bir gije jaň etdim.
I'm still thinking about it.	Men henizem ol hakda pikir edýärin.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.

Badly intelligent.	Erbet akylly.
I really saw him that night	Men ony hakykatdanam şol gije gördüm
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.

Okay.	Bolýar.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I have no choice	Mende başga ýol ýok

He wanted to do it.	Etmegini isledi.
He is there too.	Ol hem şol ýerde.
He said he did not.	Muny etmeýändigini aýtdy.
Tell me who did it.	Muny kimiň edenini aýdyň.
No requests at this time	Häzirki wagtda haýyş ýok
I'm so full of you	Men senden gaty doly
I can't let that happen	Men muňa ýol berip bilemok
I had fun with him yesterday	Düýn onuň bilen hezil etdim

He did these things.	Bu zatlary etdi.
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
He admitted this.	Ol muny boýun aldy.
Maybe we can get busy.	Belki, meşgul bolup bileris.
I hope one day I will be so good	Diňe bir gün şeýle gowy bolaryn diýip umyt edýärin

He can't do that either.	Muny hem edip bilmeýär.
I really have to go	Men hakykatdanam gitmeli
Only so.	Diňe şeýle.
He hadn't done that in years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri beýle zat etmedi.
This may be possible.	Bu mümkin bolup biler.
There is nothing or nothing here.	Bu ýerde hemme zat ýa-da hiç zat ýok.
I didn't have to tell him anything	Men oňa hiç zat aýtmaly däldim
We are you.	We sen.
I need some more time.	Maňa ýene birnäçe wagt gerek.

I have to go seriously	Men çynlakaý gitmeli
I really need money	Maňa hakykatdanam pul gerek
I don't know what happened to me.	Maňa näme bolandygyny bilemok.
He had work to do.	Onuň etmeli işi bardy.
You don't have to talk about it.	Bu hakda gürleşmek hökman däl.
He didn't think so.	Ol beýle pikir etmedi.
Be honest, with us and yourself.	Dogry aýdyň, biziň we özüňiz bilen.
I saw him, he told me	Men ony gördüm, maňa aýtdy
This is not the first time he has done so.	Ol munuň ilkinji gezek beýle däldigini aýdýar.
It could be.	Bu bolup biler.
It's easy to see me.	Meni görmek aňsat.
I haven't seen it before	Men ozal görmedim
She really doesn't like it.	Ol hakykatdanam halamaýar.
It was good for me.	Ol meniň üçin gowy boldy.
That must be the final decision.	Bu soňky karar bolmaly.
He helps us.	Ol bize kömek edýär.
I didn't know anything about this guy.	Men bu ýigit hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
He said he would.	Etjekdigini aýtdy.
He didn't have to.	Ol hökman däldi.
I was with them this morning	Men irden olar bilen boldum
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
There was nothing wrong with that	Özüm üçin ýekeje zat ýokdy
No one told him how to do it.	Hiç kim oňa muny nädip etmelidigini aýtmady.
There is more to it.	Has köp zat bolýar.
I informed him	Men oňa habar berdim
And it will be.	We bolar.
I can tell you something.	Men size bir zady aýdyp bilerin.
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
It will be.	Bu bolar.
Not really good, but really bad.	Aslynda gaty gowy däl, ýöne hakykatdanam gaty erbet.
You think that's great.	Siziň pikiriňizçe bu gaty gowy.

I have to do it right.	Men muny dogry etmeli.
I couldn't take it anymore	Indi alyp bilmedim
One for you and one for me.	Biri seniň üçin, biri meniň üçin.
I was with him.	Men onuň bilen boldum.
Of course, this is the case now.	Elbetde, häzir şeýle bolýar.
This year has been very difficult.	Bu ýyl gaty kyn boldy.
Hope is back.	Umyt gaýdyp geldi.
We have to go	Biz gitmeli
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
I knew it, and it didn't bother me	Men muny bilýärdim we bu meni biynjalyk etmedi
It was a good night.	Gowy gije boldy.
This is not us.	Bu biz däl.
This is it.	Bu şu.
It's a beautiful young thing	Ajaýyp ýaş zat
There must be a reason.	Bir sebäp bolmaly.
I need time.	Maňa wagt gerek.
I agree with that	Men muňa razy boldum
It should be possible	Mümkin bolmaly
He is such a good man.	Ol şeýle bir gowy adam.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Good guy	Gowy ýigit.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu meniň üçin edil şonuň ýaly.

Mostly.	Köplenç.
Only three days.	Diňe üç gün.
There are a number of issues.	Ol ýerde birnäçe mesele bar.
Because it was not right.	Sebäbi bu dogry däldi.
I knew there was something wrong	Bir zadyň bardygyny bilýärdim
Who knows, man.	Kim bilýär, adam.
He understood.	Ol düşündi.
We have to do it again, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Muny ýene bir gezek etmeli "-diýdi.
It's just about him.	Bu edil özi hakda.
What a bad thing this is.	Bu nähili erbet iş.
Of course I can't, but he can	Elbetde muny edip bilemok, ýöne edip biler
I want to enjoy	Men lezzet almak isleýärin
Almost no one.	Hiç kim diýen ýaly däl.
He knows better.	Ol has gowy bilýär.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
He often does this.	Ol muny köplenç edýär.
He did not want to pay attention.	Üns bermek islemedi.
He had to answer.	Ol jogap bermeli boldy.
I want to be here for them.	Men olar üçin şu ýerde bolmak isleýärin.
I didn’t know how that could be	Munuň nähili bolup biljekdigini bilmedim
I heard about it yesterday	Bu hakda düýn eşitdim
He will do so.	Şeýle eder.
I was alone this time	Men bu gezek ýeke boldum
They are together.	Olar bilelikde.

Just the right time.	Diňe dogry wagt.

It was not true.	Dogry däldi.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.

This is really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly.
Nothing.	Bir zat ýok.
You should never do that.	Muny hiç haçan etmeli däl.
This may take some time.	Bu birneme wagt alyp biler.
I thought it would be better for me tonight	Bu gije meniň üçin has gowy bolar diýip pikir etdim
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
I still have to decide	Men henizem karar bermeli
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
He is a good man.	Ol gowy adam.
He is right.	Dogry aýdýar.
This is good news.	Bu gowy habar.
I have not seen it so completely.	Men beýle doly görmedim.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Olar bilen etjek zady, zady.
I knew it was going to be really bad.	Munuň hakykatdanam erbet boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
I should never have said that	Men muny hiç haçan aýtmaly däldim
I informed him that he was there	Men oňa bardygyny habar berdim
That's right.	Bu dogry.
That's what happened to me.	Bu meniň üçin şeýle boldy.
I have a completely different idea	Mende düýbünden başga pikir bar
This is not always easy.	Bu hemişe aňsat däl.
I want those things for myself	Şol zatlary özüm üçin isleýärin
I do it alone.	Men muny ýeke edýärin.
I have to be busy.	Men meşgul bolmaly.
Only I can be.	Diňe men bolup bilerin.

I can't be with you anymore	Indi seniň bilen bolup bilemok
I will always be there for you.	Men elmydama seniň üçin bolaryn.

They are right there.	Olar edil şol ýerde.
OK, that's it.	Bolýar, ine şeýle.
I never saw him.	Men ony hiç haçan görmedim.
I have no such thing.	Mende beýle zat ýok.
I can't be fooled anymore	Meni indi samsyk edip bolmaz
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
There is no question about that.	Bu barada hiç hili sorag ýok.
Nothing happens every time.	Her gezek hiç zat ýok.
That's a good word.	Bu gowy söz.
Not so crazy.	Beýle däli däl.
I have no such thing.	Mende beýle zat ýok.
You have to admit that.	Muny boýun almaly.
Not true today.	Bu gün dogry däl.
He said it had happened before.	Ol munuň ozal bolandygyny aýtdy.
Another person.	Başga bir adam.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
I'll do one for you.	Men seniň üçin birini ederin.
Visible every day.	Her gün görünýär.
It was a little crazy here.	Bu ýerde birneme däli boldy.
This time there were several.	Bu gezek birnäçe boldy.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
It just seems to be the way to go.	Diňe bir ýol ýaly görünýär.
I don't like anyone right now	Häzirki wagtda hiç kimi halamok
In fact many times.	Aslynda köp gezek.
I'm not against it.	Men muňa garşy däl.
I can tell you he doesn't want to	Onuň islemeýändigini aýdyp bilerin
I couldn't let you	Men size rugsat berip bilmedim
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ol ýerde uly geň zat ýok.
Maybe too much.	Belki gaty köp.
I know what happened	Näme bolandygyny bilýärin
Today was not the day to do that.	Bu gün muny etjek gün däldi.
I have a question.	Mende bir sorag bar.
I shouldn't have done that to him	Men oňa beýle etmeli däldim
If a person is stupid, he can't help it	Adam samsyk bolsa, oňa kömek edip bilmez
You need to get more.	Has köp zat almaly.
There are a few things.	Birnäçe zat bar.
He thought there.	Ol ýerde pikir etdi.
What a new thing.	Nähili täze zat.
I could see him with them	Men ony olar bilen görüp bilýärdim
Then everything was still there.	Soň hemme zat henizem bardy.
Please return there.	Haýyş edýärin, ol ýere gaýdyp bilersiňiz.
I saw.	Men gördüm.
I don't think he can do anything but help us	Bize kömek etmekden başga zat edip bilmez diýip pikir edýärin
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
I could not return	Men gaýdyp bilmedim
He thought there would be no mistake this time around.	Bu gezek ýalňyşlyk bolmaz diýip pikir etdi.
I didn't think it would be difficult	Munuň kyn boljakdygyny pikir etmedim
This is not a big deal.	Bu uly mesele däl.
That was a concern.	Bu alada boldy.
I think you know a lot.	Köp zady bilýärsiň öýdýän.
I'll be early.	Men ir bolaryn.

He did it for me.	Muny maňa etdi.
Ma'am.	Bu.

What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Nähili ajaýyp zat.
Everything there is really beautiful.	Şol ýerde hemme zat hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
Really, right away.	Hakykatdanam, derrew.
That's what happens.	Ine, şeýle bolýar.
You can help us.	Bize kömek edip bilersiňiz.
I had no choice	Mende hiç hili mümkinçilik ýokdy
That day was the last day.	Şol gün iň soňky gün boldy.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
Why does everyone want it?	Näme üçin her kim ony isleýär?
I want to do everything with you	Hemme zady seniň bilen etmek isleýärin
I have to be here for you	Men seniň üçin şu ýerde bolmaly
I can't get anything right now	Men şu wagt hiç zat alyp bilemok
I have been here several times	Men bu ýerde birnäçe gezek boldum
I couldn't be that person	Men ol adam bolup bilmedim
What will he do?	Ol näme eder.
We have to go, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Biz gitmeli "-diýdi.
In fact, there were a few more.	Aslynda ýene birnäçe adam bardy.

I already know enough	Men eýýäm ýeterlik bilýärin
Of course.	Elbetde.
I can't be with a man	Men bir adam bilen bolup bilemok
No one was home at the time.	Şol wagt hiç kim öýde ýokdy.

I just want to go home	Men diňe öýe gitmek isleýärin

It was not a great sound.	Bu ajaýyp ses däldi.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
The only problem is.	Diňe mesele sebäp bolýar.
I never did.	Men hiç haçan etmedim.
I don't think that was enough	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýeterlik däldi
I didn’t want a big problem	Uly kynçylyk islemedim
He hoped it would not happen.	Ol beýle bolmaz diýip umyt etdi.
Last week was a bad week.	Geçen hepde erbet hepde boldy.
Man, what a meal.	Adam, nähili nahar.
Another issue and absolutely good.	Başga bir mesele we düýbünden gowy.
Maybe that's a good thing.	Belki, bu gowy zat.
I think this is very difficult	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty kyn
No one knew it.	Hiç kim ony bilmeýärdi.
I thought it would be easy	Munuň aňsat boljakdygyny pikir etdim
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
I can only think of one thing	Men diňe bir zat hakda pikir edip bilerin
I know not everyone can do that	Her kimiň muny edip bilmejekdigini bilýärin
I think you have a good reason for that	Siziň munuň gowy sebäbi bar öýdýän
It was like that.	Bu onuň ýalydy.
You are not	Sen beýle däl
I told you only one.	Men saňa diňe birini aýtdym.
There was a problem here.	Bu ýerde kynçylyk bardy.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
I was with him.	Men onuň bilen boldum.
I want to do this myself.	Muny özüm etmek isleýärin.
That was not the case before.	Ozal beýle däldi.
It's hard to get that.	Muny almak kyn.
He could see it now.	Ol muny indi görüp bilýärdi.
I didn't think much of it	Men ol hakda kän pikir etmedim
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, men däl.
And now he knows better.	Indi bolsa, ol has gowy bilýär.
What is this	Bu näme bolýar.
He wants to make me better.	Ol meni has gowy etmek isleýär.
A little	Biraz.
It will never happen.	Bu asla bolmaz.
There is something for everyone there.	Ol ýerde hemmeler üçin bir zat bar.
It can be hard to pay attention.	Üns bermek kyn bolup biler.
I can't be with you	Men seniň bilen bolup bilemok
Everything looks good.	Hemme zat gowy görünýär.
It was necessary.	Zerur boldy.
Whenever	Haçan bolsa.
This is not wonderful.	Bu ajaýyp däl.
He asked again.	Ol ýene sorady.

In fact, almost everything.	Aslynda hemme zat diýen ýaly.
Probably not anymore.	Indi mümkin däl bolsa gerek.
No words for that.	Munuň üçin söz ýok.
You need an answer now.	Size häzir jogap gerek.

A few hundred years.	Birnäçe ýüz ýyl.

This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
It also makes you happy.	Bu hem sizi bagtly edýär.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
It can't be, it just can't be.	Bolup bilmeýär, diňe edip bilmeýär.
I knew it was nothing	Munuň hiç zat däldigini bilýärdim
I called him again	Men oňa ýene jaň etdim
I didn't do anything with me.	Men bilen hiç zat etmedim.
He knows nothing.	Ol hiç zady bilmeýär.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.

There are several good reasons for doing so.	Muny etmegiň birnäçe gowy sebäbi bar.
Not here.	Bu ýerde ýok.
He said it was fast.	Ol munuň çalt bolandygyny aýtdy.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.

Too many.	Gaty köp.

Maybe not much.	Belki kän däl.
Often this is good.	Köplenç bu gowy.

There is a problem.	Kynçylyk bar.

What happened to him this year?	Bu ýyl oňa näme boldy.
I may need it tonight	Maňa şu gije gerek bolmagy mümkin
This is not the case at all	Bu düýbünden ýok
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.

He never thought of it that way.	Ol muny asla pikir etmedi.
So this is not the worst thing.	Şonuň üçin bu iň erbet zat däl.
I can't make another call	Başga bir jaň edip bilemok
There is a strange problem.	Geň bir mesele bar.
I'm so scared of that	Men muňa gaty gorkýaryn

Of course, this is not a new idea.	Elbetde bu täze pikir däl.

He is not here.	Ol bu ýerde däl.
One evening he left again.	Bir gün agşam ol ýene gitdi.

Not only that, he agrees.	Diňe özi däl, razy.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.

You have to do this for me	Muny meniň üçin etmeli
He stayed there for three years.	Ol üç ýyl şol ýerde galdy.

I knew this was not true	Munuň dogry däldigini bilýärdim
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
This is a problem.	Bu bir mesele.
No tomorrow.	Ertir ýok.
I did it once, but not now.	Bir gezek etdim, ýöne indi beýle däl.
Maybe for the first time.	Belki ilkinji gezek.
I need help.	Kömek gerek.
You need something or other.	Size zerur ýa-da başga bir zat gerek.
It's very difficult for him.	Oňa gaty kyn.
This is probably a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele bolsa gerek.
I think it's great	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ajaýyp
Only.	Diňe.
Do better.	Has gowy et.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
I'm not ready for that.	Men muňa taýyn däl.
And then he does.	Soň bolsa edýär.
I only know the truth	Men diňe bir hakykaty bilýärin
She seems happy.	Ol bagtly ýaly.
Nothing now.	Häzir hiç zat ýok.
He didn't do that.	Ol beýle zat etmedi.
The sound was very immediate	Ses gaty derrew boldy
Maybe not much.	Belki kän däl.
I just thought of something, and it happened	Men diňe bir zat hakda pikir etdim, şeýle boldy
I told her it was not a good day.	Men oňa gowy gün däldigini aýtdym.
Now he knew.	Indi bilýärdi.
He started so young.	Ol şeýle ýaş başlady.
I think it will help	Kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin
What happened last night was great.	Düýn agşam bolup geçen zatlar gaty gowy boldy.
I know two things now	Men indi iki zady bilýärin
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
I couldn't think of anything	Men hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilmedim
Someone has to go.	Biri gitmeli.
I think he wanted it for me too	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hem meniň üçin isledi
Long time no see	Kän wagt.
I'm worried right now.	Men şu wagt alada edýärin.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Not enough to do.	Etmek ýeterlik däl.
This is not my first.	Bu meniň ilkinji däl.
He thought maybe not.	Ol, belki, beýle däl diýip pikir etdi.
He did it and that's enough.	Ol muny etdi we ýeterlik.
It really does exist.	Hakykatdanam bar.
I can't do it tonight	Men şu gije edip bilemok
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
What made you come here?	Seni bu ýere näme sebäp etdi?
You can do that	Muny edip bilersiňiz
More questions, maybe.	Has köp sorag, belki.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
I am not.	Men, beýle däl.
It was good with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy boldy.
I have already said a lot	Men eýýäm gaty köp zat aýtdym
I've only seen it twice	Men muny diňe iki gezek gördüm
I think it's good	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin
I couldn't sleep all night	Men bütin gije uklap bilmedim
Life can be hard.	Durmuş kyn bolup biler.
I can't really answer better	Men hakykatdanam has gowy jogap berip bilemok
Me.	Ine.
That would be great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp bolardy.
No more.	Indi ýok.
I'll call you in the morning	Irden saňa jaň ederin
This can be both good and bad.	Bu hem gowy, hem erbet zat bolup biler.
There are two ways to do this.	Munuň üçin iki ýol bar.
I thought it was not very good	Bu gaty gowy däl diýip pikir etdim
I think this is very stupid	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty samsyk
Isn't that so?	Beýle dälmi?
You can see this as bad.	Muny erbet diýip görüp bilersiňiz.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, hakykatdanam şeýle.
It was a little good.	Bu birneme gowy boldy.
I'm not much younger than you	Men senden kän ýaş däldim
I thought it would help you	Size kömek eder öýdüpdim
For a very good reason.	Gaty gowy sebäp üçin.
I can't do anything about it	Men bu hakda hiç zat edip bilemok
There has to be a better way.	Has gowy ýol bolmaly.
That should be sufficient enough.	Bu ýeterlik bolmaly.
He asked me another question.	Ol maňa ýene sorag berdi.
In fact, he no longer wanted to talk about it.	Aslynda indi bu hakda gürleşmek islemedi.
Good.	Gowy.
Maybe not good.	Belki gowy däl.
It sounds stupid, but it's a big reason.	Bu samsyk ýaly görünýär, ýöne gaty uly sebäp.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
I hadn't called him in a few days	Birnäçe gün bäri oňa jaň etmedim
I don't have to be here with him	Men onuň bilen bu ýerde bolmaly däl
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I haven't seen him in two days	Men ony iki gün bäri görmedim
OK, not again.	Bolýar, ýene däl.
I said.	Men aýtdym.
Often there was no money for it.	Köplenç munuň üçin pul ýokdy.
I didn't think about it	Men bu hakda hiç zat pikir etmedim
I never had to go.	Men hiç haçan gitmeli däldim.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
Nothing else.	Başga zady ýok.
I did not want to know the truth myself.	Hakykaty özüm bilmek islemedim.
Now this is it.	Indi bu iki.
For the truth of this.	Munuň hakykaty üçin.
This may take some time.	Bu birneme wagt alyp biler.
Of course, I had nothing to do with it	Elbetde, munuň bilen hiç zat etmeli däldim
I think this will be good for him	Bu onuň üçin gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
I had a lot of fun.	Men gaty hezil etdim.
There is a problem here	Bu ýerde bir mesele bar
Nothing can take that away.	Hiç zat muny alyp bilmez.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Bu hakda edip biljek zady ýokdy.
This is not the case either.	Bu hem däl.
I could love it now	Men indi has gowy görüp bilýärdim
I can say that myself.	Muny özüm aýdyp bilerin.
This man is crazy.	Bu adam däli bolýar.
I can't buy anymore	Indi satyn alyp bilemok
Came home	Öýe geldi.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmeli däl.
I'm there.	Men ol ýerde bar.
That's a good thing for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin gaty gowy zat.
Here they are!	Ine, olar!
I could do it all day	Men muny bütin gün edip bilýärdim
I didn't think he would do it.	Ony eder öýdemokdym.
There are actually two reasons.	Aslynda iki sebäp bar.
That's what happened.	Şeýle boldy.
So you have a number of options.	Şonuň üçin size birnäçe mümkinçilik bar.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
Not a bad life here.	Bu ýerde erbet durmuş däl.
Work.	Iş.
Okay, he fell asleep.	Bolýar, ol uklap galdy.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
I think about it every day	Men ol hakda her gün pikir edýärin
I think he said that.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny aýtdy.
He called me today.	Ol şu gün maňa jaň etdi.
This is better.	Bu has gowy.
Same thing.	Edil şol bir zat.
I haven't seen it in a while	Biraz wagt bäri görmedim
I want that	Men muny isleýärin
This is often true.	Bu köplenç dogry.
A little	Biraz.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I know something else	Men başga zady bilýärin
It may not be good, but it is.	Belki gowy bolmaz, ýöne şeýle.
Of course it should	Elbetde bolmaly
I did not.	Men etmedim.
I didn’t want to think too much about it	Bu barada gaty köp pikir etmek islemedim
I was with him.	Men onuň bilen boldum.
Of course, I didn't do that	Elbetde, beýle zady etmedim
Of course this is possible.	Elbetde bu mümkin.
I really didn't mind	Men hakykatdanam muňa garşy däldim
I may have.	Mende bolup biler.
That's great.	Bu ajaýyp zat.
There was no other time.	Başga wagt ýokdy.
What is this	Bu näme.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
Strange thing.	Geň zat.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gowy pikir, ýöne bu dogry däl.
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
He would need it every day or two.	Her gün ýa-da iki gün oňa gerek bolardy.
He wanted it, he got it.	Isledi, aldy.
I got it by mistake.	Men ony ýalňyşlyk bilen aldym.
He is not human.	Ol adam däl.
How to do this?	Muny nädip etmeli?
I'm with them.	Men olar bilen.
What is this	Bu näme?
I never thought of doing something like this	Munuň ýaly bir zat etmek hakda hiç zat pikir etmedim
That's the way it is today.	Bu gün şeýle boldy.
I don't care so much about you.	Men sen hakda beýle alada etmeýärin.
I had to do something.	Men bir zat etmeli boldum.
There was a man with them.	Olar bilen bir adam bardy.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
I couldn't tell you	Saňa aýdyp bilmedim
I think this is a great thing for you	Bu siziň üçin gaty gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin
So this is not a problem.	Şonuň üçin bu mesele däl.
He is not stupid.	Ol samsyk däl.
Such things happen.	Şeýle zatlar bolýar.
It took time.	Wagt gerek boldy.
This is the guy we need.	Bu bize gerek ýigit.
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
He had a chance.	Oňa bir mümkinçilik bardy.
I did a very bad job	Men gaty erbet iş etdim
He just had to go. 	Ol diňe gitmeli boldy. 
This is not strange or stupid.	Bu geň ýa-da samsyk däl.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
This is really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet.
The reason! 	Sebäp!
'	' diýdi.
I told her what had happened	Men oňa näme bolandygyny aýtdym
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
In fact, there was no short and long way.	Aslynda gysga we uzak ýol ýokdy.
I didn't do that.	Men muny etmedim.
A madman	Bir däli.
I don't think so	Bu gaty erbet däl öýdýän
It's been a long time coming.	Uzak wagt geldi.
This is a close question.	Bu ýakyn sorag.
It seems to have made more noise.	Has köp ses eden ýaly.
I thought it would be me.	Bu men bolar öýdüpdim.
I never did that	Men hiç wagt beýle zady etmedim
He was not there.	Ol ýerde ýokdy.
Only himself and this wonderful sound	Diňe özi we bu ajaýyp ses
I only got one.	Men diňe birini aldym.
Now this.	Indi bu.
Good, really good.	Gowy, hakykatdanam gowy.
Ma'am.	Bu.
He wants something.	Bir zat isleýär.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
I'll be here tomorrow	Men ertir şu ýerde bolaryn
It doesn't seem to be.	Beýle däl ýaly.
I want the truth.	Men hakykaty isleýärin.
I knew he wasn't serious	Men onuň çynlakaý däldigini bilýärdim
Of course.	Elbetde.
You may need something for yourself.	Özüňiz üçin zatlar gerek bolup biler.
It's good, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Gowy "-diýdi.
He did not want to do that.	Ol muny etmek islemedi.
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
It was not very good to see him.	Ony görmek gaty gowy däldi.
Okay, maybe he will do it now.	Bolýar, belki häzir eder.
He stayed there that night.	Ol şol gije şol ýerde galdy.
It actually looks beautiful now.	Aslynda indi owadan görünýär.
I think he's really gone.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hakykatdanam gitdi.
Why really?	Hakykatdanam näme üçin?
I knew what he was thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilýärdim
I knew it was going to happen, but	Munuň boljakdygyny bilýärdim, ýöne
This is very difficult for us.	Bu biziň üçin gaty kyn.
They are beautiful things.	Olar owadan zatlar.
It does well.	Gowy edýär.
I think that's great.	Bu gaty gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
There is no money at all.	Hatda pul ýok.
He said it was not.	Ol beýle däldigini aýtdy.
I never got to him.	Men oňa hiç wagt baryp bilmedim.
He did not report it.	Ol muny habar bermedi.
I thought it might be gone.	Belki ýok bolar öýdüpdim.
He couldn't think of one.	Ol bir gezek pikir edip bilmedi.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
I couldn't get enough	Men ýeterlik bolup bilmedim
Of course not twice.	Elbetde iki gezek däl.
There was no problem.	Mesele ýokdy.
He is with me right now.	Ol şu wagt meniň bilen.
I thought he could help me	Ol maňa kömek edip biler diýip pikir etdim
What more do you need?	Mundan başga näme gerek?
It's been a long time coming	Bu eýýäm uzak ýol boldy
He was there too.	Ol hem bardy.
I didn’t want any of that	Men munuň hiç birini islemedim
It's you.	Bu sen.
He could even tell.	Hatda aýdyp bilýärdi.
I need it fast	Maňa bu zat çalt gerek
I can't go again	Men ýene gidip bilemok
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
I do it just for fun.	Men muny diňe hezil etmek üçin edýärin.
It was not easy to do that.	Muny etmek aňsat däldi.
Of course, this may take some time.	Elbetde, bu birneme wagt alyp biler.
I tried to help him.	Men oňa kömek etjek boldum.
It was as if he was trying to do it.	Etjek bolýan ýalydy.
I couldn't be that way	Men beýle bolup bilmedim
It's there, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Ol ýerde "diýdi.
About it.	Bu barada.
I'm happy about that	Men muňa begenýärin
You are not with me	Sen meniň bilen däl
No one cares.	Hiç kim bu barada alada etmeýär.
Sounds like fun work.	Gyzykly iş ýaly.
The word came out.	Söz çykdy.
He didn't tell me about it.	Ol bu hakda maňa aýtmady.
In fact, he said no.	Aslynda ol ýok diýdi.
I think he just wanted to talk	Meniň pikirimçe, ol diňe gürleşmek isledi
Good young	Gowy ýaş.
I really can't	Men hakykatdanam edip bilemok
Easy and easy.	Aňsat we aňsat.

He got it a few days ago.	Birnäçe gün ozal aldy.
It's an opportunity.	Ol bir mümkinçilik.
He will make it happy.	Ol muny bagtly eder.
This is not a lie.	Bu ýalan däl.
You will have to tell the truth.	Siz hakykaty aýtmaly bolarsyňyz.
It can be difficult.	Kyn bolup biler.
You don't have to do that yourself.	Muny özüňiz etmeli däl.

She is wonderful.	Ol ajaýyp.
Everything seems to be there.	Hemme zat bar ýaly.

I won't be like that anymore	Men indi beýle bolmaz
I need help.	Maňa kömek gerek.
Here's how.	Ine, nähili.
Had to call.	Jaň etmeli boldy.
This is new.	Bu täze.
It really should be.	Hakykatdanam bolmaly.
It seemed so good to me.	Bu maňa gaty gowy ýalydy.

No one wants to hurt you.	Hiç kim size zyýan bermek islemeýär.
Even a very good thing.	Hatda gaty gowy zat.
I don't know, but it will be interesting to know.	Bilmedim, ýöne bilmek gyzykly bolar.

How did he know that?	Muny nädip bilýärdi.
She is at home.	Ol öýde.

The new day has come	Täze gün geldi
You can always do it.	Elmydama edip bilersiňiz.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I gave it to you once	Men saňa bir gezek berdim
He said this month.	Şu aý aýtdy.
To give him a new life.	Oňa täze durmuş bermek.
You can't really worry about that.	Bu barada hakykatdanam alada edip bolmaz.
He didn't have to go far.	Uzak gitmeli däldi.
There are many people	Köp adam bar
No idea.	Hiç hili pikir ýok.
They were the only ones here.	Bu ýerde diňe olar bardy.
It did me good.	Bu maňa gowy etdi.
It's hard to be.	Kyn bolmak kyn.

How to get it?	Nädip almaly?
He wanted to be right	Dogry etmek isledi
I knew it would happen.	Boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
Of course, this is not a good thing.	Elbetde, bu gowy zat däl.
There was a good reason for that	Munuň gowy sebäbi bardy
It is not enough to be here alone.	Diňe şu ýerde bolmak ýeterlik däl.
He was not.	Ol däldi.
She came home two days ago.	Iki gün ozal öýüne geldi.
I can only speak for myself now	Men indi diňe özüm üçin gürläp bilerin

As long as it takes.	Näçe wagt gerek bolsa.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.

You are so beautiful	Sen gaty owadan
And then he was happy.	Soň bolsa bagtly boldy.

I hope he doesn't want a loan	Karz islemeýär diýip umyt edýärin
With a new job.	Täze iş bilen.
It was a good day.	Gowy gün boldy.

He is telling the truth.	Ol hakykaty aýdýar.
No money at all.	Asla pul ýok.

We can't help it.	Biz muňa kömek edip bilmeris.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmek hökman däl.
This is also true.	Bu hem dogry.
I had to go with him	Men onuň bilen gitmeli boldum
I was alone.	Men ýeke özüm boldum.

He wants to go back to school and do something for himself.	Mekdebe gaýdyp, özüne bir zatlar etmek isleýär.
He can't help it.	Ol muňa kömek edip bilmez.
I didn't want to know that	Muny bilmek islemedim
I have to be with you	Men seniň bilen bolmaly

It's about you.	Bu sen hakda.
I really didn't know what he was doing for a living	Durmuş üçin näme edenini hakykatdanam bilmeýärdim
It was another day for me.	Bu maňa başga bir gün boldy.
Also not new.	Şeýle hem täze däl.
I wondered what had happened to him.	Men oňa näme boldy diýip pikir etdim.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.

Why? 	Näme üçin?

It's been a few weeks.	Birnäçe hepde bäri bar.
Now I want to do that.	Indi şeýle etmek isleýärin.

I thought it was a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir etdim.
It happened.	Ol boldy.
This is exactly what happened.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
This is what you want.	Bu seniň isleýän zadyň.

Something better for us	Biziň üçin has gowy zat
He is not like him today.	Ol şu gün özi ýaly däl.
This is a very strange answer.	Bu gaty geň jogap.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.

This time it will be the last.	Bu gezek iň soňky bolar.
No words.	Söz ýok.
It can't be that hard.	Bu beýle kyn bolup bilmez.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şeýle pikir etmeli.
Absolutely different now.	Häzir düýbünden başga.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
I couldn't rest anymore	Indi dynç alyp bilmedim
He wants to be there.	Ine, şol ýerde bolmak isleýär.
I didn't even have to say anything	Men hatda hiç zat aýtmaly däldim
The problem.	Mesele.
In fact, he was not crazy.	Aslynda oňa däli däldi.
It sounds too long.	Muňa gaty uzak ses.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Uly mesele.
Good.	Gowy.
I did it just to be good.	Men muny diňe gowy bolmak üçin etdim.
I never thought about it	Men bu barada hiç wagt pikir etmedim

I never did that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmedim.
He was not a bad person.	Erbet adam däldi.
Everything.	Hemme zat.
I have something for you	Meniň saňa bir zadym bar
I think it's been a while.	Biraz wagt boldy öýdýän.
Of course, that was for me	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin boldy
He is with us.	Ol biziň bilen.
He, he, he.	Ol, ol, ol.
I can't think of anything.	Hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilemok.
Not much.	Kän zat däl.
It works well.	Bu gowy iş edýär.
More than that.	Has köp zat.
I was actually here again, but this time for them	Aslynda ýene şu ýerde boldum, ýöne bu gezek olar üçin
I can enjoy it	Mundan lezzet alyp bilerin
I thought it was someone	Men muny kimdir biri diýip pikir etdim
I think something hurt you.	Meniň pikirimçe, bir zat size zyýan berdi.
I was up early	Men ir gije boldum
So you are here.	Şonuň üçin sen şu ýerde.
No one.	Biri ýok.
There is no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýok.
Of course, that was not enough for you.	Elbetde, ol siziň üçin ýeterlik däldi.
I'm not against it.	Men muňa garşy däl.
It can and will happen.	Bu bolup biler we bolar.
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
I can't give you more	Men size has köp zat berip bilemok
I don't believe he will.	Men onuň muny etjekdigine ynanamok.
I really didn't know.	Men hakykatdanam bilmedim.
This is another matter.	Bu başga mesele.
It will not happen again.	Mundan beýläk bolmaz.
I have this problem.	Mende bu mesele bar.
The police then took him away	Soň polisiýa ony alyp gitdi
Everything was possible.	Hemme zat mümkin boldy.
The worst part is.	Iň erbet zat.
I think he likes me	Meniň pikirimçe, ol meni halaýar
Somewhere	Bir ýerde.
It just has to be the two of us.	Bu diňe ikimiz bolmaly.
I think it could be, but it doesn't seem to be very likely	Bolup biler öýdýärin, ýöne gaty ähtimal däl ýaly
I really don't.	Men hakykatdanam ýok.
He's gone now.	Ol indi gitdi.
So full	Şeýle bir doly
I thought someone like you could help me	Seniň ýaly biri maňa kömek edip biler öýdüpdim
This is not necessary.	Bu zerur däl.
Which is not.	Haýsy däl.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
I have heard that this may be true.	Munuň dogry bolup biljekdigini eşitdim.
This is not a short book.	Bu gysga kitap däl.
That person is very good.	Ol adam gaty gowy.
It could be the same.	Şeýle hem bolup biler.
Not a good answer.	Gowy jogap däl.
I just can't say right now	Diňe şu wagt aýdyp biljek däl
I have never seen anything like it before.	Munuň ýaly zady öňem görmedim.
The next few times.	Indiki birnäçe gezek.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
Two for two.	Iki üçin iki.
This is great!	Bu gaty ajaýyp!
This is for me.	Bu meniň üçin.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
The good news is, you don't have to worry.	Gowy habar, alada etmeli däl.
A little too much.	Biraz köp.
The next way is gone	Indiki ýol hem gitdi
Of course it was.	Elbetde ýalydy.
I paid attention and it was great.	Üns berdim we bu gaty gowy boldy.
You really are yourself.	Siz hakykatdanam özüňiz.
I thought it was great.	Gaty gowy geldi öýdüpdim.
He never wants to go anywhere or do anything.	Ol hiç wagt hiç ýere gitmek ýa-da bir zat etmek islemeýär.
I thought he would come back	Men gaýdyp geler öýdüpdim
This is serious.	Bu çynlakaý bolýar.
Of course, this is the case.	Elbetde, bu mesele.
I think everyone does that	Her kim muny edýär diýip pikir edýärin
This is clear.	Bu aýdyň.
I did not know immediately	Men derrew bilmedim
I could do nothing	Men hiç zat edip bilmedim
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
I didn't know what had happened to him	Onuň bilen näme bolandygyny bilmedim
Of course they were.	Elbetde, olar bardy.
I can't do anything else	Başga hiç zat edip bilemok
Do it now	Indi et.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
It can be short.	Gysga bolup biler.
Not much.	Kän däl.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people	Edil şonuň ýaly etmäge taýyn bolmaly
There has never been a problem before.	Öň hiç wagt mesele ýokdy.
Sorry, this feature is no longer available.	Bagyşlaň, bu mümkinçilik indi ýok.
I have to do things right	Men zatlary dogry etmeli
This is the first time I've been scared.	Men ilkinji gezek gorkýaryn.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
I don't think so.	Men ol hakda pikir etmeýärin.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
He too.	Ol hem.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
For the first time	Ilkinji gezek
I think that's all	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hemme zat
I gave myself completely and fully	Özümi doly we doly berdim
Of course, I didn't think that would be helpful	Elbetde, bu kömek edip bolmaz diýip pikir etdim
How much is the question?	Sorag näçe?
Maybe we can do that here.	Belki, muny şu ýerde edip bileris.
Probably.	Mümkin.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
They are very good at it.	Olar bu barada gaty gowy zat.
He wants to talk to us.	Ol biziň bilen gürleşmek isleýär.
There was no reason to do that.	Etmeli sebäbi ýokdy.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat gaty gowy.
Then there are other things.	Soň başga zatlar bar.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
There is no news.	Ol ýerde habar ýok.
It should be a lot of money.	Bu köp pul bolmaly.
He asked what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny sorady.
Not for you, but for me.	Seniň üçin däl, meniň üçin.
He did not allow it.	Ol rugsat bermedi.
No more worries.	Indi alada ýok.
We really need to stop doing that.	Biz hakykatdanam muny etmegi bes etmeli.
I can see it, he took it.	Men ony görüp bilýärin, ony özüne aldy.
Just right.	Diňe dogry.
He left.	Ol özi gitdi.
I don’t think that was good.	Munuň gowy bolandygyny pikir etmeýärin.
It took a month.	Bir aý gerek boldy.
I have to go	Men gitmeli
Because he has nothing new.	Sebäbi onuň täze zady ýok.
What not.	Näme däl.
How much did it cost?	Näçe gitdi
I'm smarter than you	Men senden has akylly.
Do something and do well.	Bir zady et we gowy et.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
he said.	' ol aýtdy.
Whatever happens, it will happen.	Näme bolar, bolar.
I hoped it would come	Asla geler diýip umyt etdim
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
Just like before.	Edil öňküsi ýaly.
Not true.	Dogry däl.
I thought it would be a good day	Bu gün gowy gün bolar öýdüpdim
He hoped it would not take long.	Kän wagt gerek bolmaz diýip umyt etdi.
This is a very strange idea.	Bu gaty geň pikir.
It was not fun.	Bu gyzykly däldi.
I was not good enough.	Men ýeterlik däldim.
I hope not for the last time.	Soňky gezek däl diýip umyt edýärin.
It takes two months.	Iki aý gerek.
Go for it.	Munuň üçin gitmek.
So he was crazy.	Şonuň üçin däli boldy.
The short answer is 'not himself'.	Gysga jogap 'özi däl'.
I did something else	Men başga zat etdim
I have no, no	Mende ýok, ýok
I want him to do something about it	Bu hakda bir zat etmegini isleýärin
There were several reasons for calling.	Jaň etmegiň birnäçe sebäbi bardy.
Bad thing.	Erbet zat.
It will not happen again.	Indi beýle bolmaz.
I knew, I was very worried.	Bilýärdim, gaty alada etdim.
One thing.	Bir zat.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman däl.
I think something could happen in the near future	Meniň pikirimçe ýakyn wagtda bir zat bolup biler
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe bir uly zat.
It just seems a little silly.	Diňe birneme samsyk ýaly görünýär.
I've been to someone before	Men öň kimdir biri bilen boldum
I only have one, and that's enough	Mende diňe bir bar we bu ýeterlik
There is no clear reason for this.	Munuň aýdyň sebäbi ýok.
You are not human	Sen adam däl
He knows a lot.	Ol muny köp bilýär.
He tried to help.	Kömek etjek boldy.
They should be.	Olar bolmaly.
Everything was hard, it was like work.	Hemme zat kyn, iş ýalydy.
I really want you	Men seni hakykatdanam isleýärin
This is more likely.	Bu has ähtimal.
We have to be clear.	Biz aýdyň bolmaly.
I didn’t want to think anymore	Indi pikir etmek islemedim
Ma'am.	Bu.
Good.	Gowy.
Nothing is right.	Hiç zat dogry däl.
I just didn’t want to think about it	Diňe bu hakda pikir etmek islemedim
I don't want anything else	Mundan başga zat islämok
Of course it was.	Elbetde, ol şeýle boldy.
I was worried about him	Men onuň hakda alada etdim
Life was never like that.	Durmuş hiç wagt beýle däldi.
Of course, it wasn't that bad.	Elbetde, beýle erbet däldi.
Of course I didn't.	Elbetde etmedim.
I couldn't do it again	Men ýene edip bilmedim
Of course different	Elbetde başga
They are.	Olar.
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele.
This is it.	Bu özi.
He said OK.	Bolýar diýdi.
I did it.	Men muny etdim.
I was not good enough for him	Men onuň üçin ýeterlik däldim
It's hard to go.	Gitmek kyn.
What did he do to me?	Ol maňa näme etdi.
He was right.	Ol gaty dogry aýtdy.
In fact, it seems impossible.	Aslynda, mümkin däl iş ýaly bolup görünýär.
I can't answer it	Men oňa jogap berip bilemok
You have to do it for the first time.	Ilkinji gezek etmeli.
Really short.	Hakykatdanam gysga.
There is still a chance for you and him.	Siziň we onuň üçin henizem bir mümkinçilik bar.
If so, you may be wondering.	Şeýle bolsa, bu barada has gowy pikir edip bilersiňiz.
I told her everything	Men oňa hemme zady aýtdym
I'll do the right thing	Dogry zady ederin
Maybe a little.	Belki birneme.
I can't tell anyone else	Başga hiç kime aýdyp bilemok
I could not go home.	Men öýe baryp bilmedim.
I have a better idea	Mende has gowy pikir bar
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, iň gowy zat.
He said it there.	Ol ýerde muny aýtdy.
I never did	Men hiç wagt edip bilmedim
You can do more with this.	Munuň bilen has köp zat edip bilersiňiz.
I knew he was there for me	Onuň meniň üçin bardygyny bilýärdim
It will not be possible tomorrow.	Ertir mümkin bolmaz.
The same thing happened with the previous one.	Edil şol bir zat öňküsi ýaly boldy.
There may be more, but there must be more.	Has köp zat bolup biler, ýöne bu köp zat bolmaly.
I didn’t always know that	Men muny hemişe bilmeýärdim
You're not ready yet.	Siz entek muňa taýyn däl.
There is very good advice there.	Ol ýerde gaty gowy maslahat bar.
Nothing about you here.	Bu ýerde sen hakda hiç zat ýok.
Not bad.	Erbet däl ýaly.
Incredibly beautiful	Ajaýyp owadan.
Ma'am.	Bu.
Everything is just that.	Hemme zat diňe.
I can't think of him that way	Men onuň beýle pikir edip bilemok
I can't think right now	Men şu wagt pikir edip bilemok
Something here.	Bu ýerde bir zat.
He can do the same.	Şeýle hem edip biler.
OK, you can go.	Bolýar, gidip bilersiňiz.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
They are us.	Olar biz.
There are two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar.
I think where to go	Meniň pikirimçe, nirä gitmeli
There was no one.	Hiç kim ýokdy.
I know this is not an easy task	Munuň aňsat iş däldigini bilýärin
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ol meniň üçin gowy zat.
Now this is really bad.	Indi bu hakykatdanam erbet.
I think he will help me	Ol maňa kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin
Okay, not at all, but almost.	Bolýar, düýbünden däl, ýöne diýen ýaly.
Only a few remained.	Diňe birnäçe adam galdy.
He asked how it was.	Nädip bolandygyny sorady.
I saw him, he was with someone.	Men ony gördüm, ol kimdir biri bilen boldy.
To tell the truth.	Hakykaty aýtmak üçin.
Not true.	Dogry däl.
He was with the police.	Ol polisiýa bardy.
I can hardly speak	Men gürläp bilemok diýen ýaly
Something could happen next.	Soň bir zat bolup biler.
I don't do that	Men muny etmeýärin
As good as anything is now.	Hemme zat ýaly häzir gowy.
So often that is the case.	Şonuň üçin köplenç şeýle bolýar.
I have said this three times.	Men muny üç gezek aýtdym.
I wasn’t even close.	Men hatda ýakyn hem däldim.
Now another.	Indi başga.
Not surprisingly.	Geň däl.
I want it again	Men ony ýene isleýärin
Strange or really smart.	Geň ýa-da hakykatdanam akylly.
No money.	Pul ýok.
Maybe something is right.	Belki, dogry bir zat bolmagy mümkin.
So there seemed to be an opportunity there.	Şonuň üçin ol ýerde bir mümkinçilik bar ýalydy.
It's hard for me.	Bu meniň üçin kyn.
This was not the only thing.	Bu diňe bir zatlar däldi.
I got this every week	Muny her hepde aldym
A lot of time.	Wagt köp.
The police can see us.	Bizi polisiýa görüp biler.
I didn't want to do that	Men muny etmek islemedim
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I have never been so happy	Men hiç wagt beýle bagtly däldim
Can anyone still do this?	Muny entek edip biljek barmy?
A lot can happen.	Köp zat bolup biler.
It really helps.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek edýär.
This cannot happen to them	Bu olar üçin bolup bilmez
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
He thought it would be nice to see him.	Ony görmek gowy bolar diýip pikir etdi.
Good and good.	Gowy we gowy.
I call every year.	Her ýyl jaň edýärin.
I had to do it.	Men muny etmeli boldum.
He understood me.	Ol maňa düşündi.
Because, of course, that was not the case.	Sebäbi, elbetde, beýle däldi.
I tried everything.	Men hemme zady synap gördüm.
Better news.	Has gowy habar.
I agree.	Men razy.
No idea is stupid.	Hiç hili pikir samsyk däl.
I had to do something about it	Men ol hakda bir zat etmeli boldum
One day he will be there.	Bir gün ol ýerde bolar.
This is different for me.	Bu meniň üçin başga.
I still have	Men henizem bar
Say strange things.	Geň zatlary aýdyň.
This is different.	Bu başga.
Not the best answer, but not the worst.	Iň gowy jogap däl, ýöne erbet däl.
I can do better than you	Men senden has gowy edip bilerin
I could see it.	Men ony görüp bilýärdim.
You have nothing.	Saňa hiç zat ýok.
I tried to call him yesterday	Düýn oňa jaň etjek boldum
It may be the only sound here.	Ol bu ýerde ýeke-täk ses bolup biler.
I told him the truth.	Men oňa hakykaty aýtdym.
In fact, they are very fast.	Aslynda olar gaty çalt.
I want to live with him	Men onuň bilen durmuş isleýärin
Maybe very good.	Belki gaty gowy.
The good news is, it's disappearing.	Gowy habar, ýok bolýar.
I couldn't think of anything else to do	Başga bir zat etmek hakda pikir edip bilmedim
Girl, what do you want?	Gyz, saňa näme gerek bolar.
We both need to stop doing that.	Ikimizem muny etmegi bes etmeli.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
I never worried.	Men hiç wagt alada etmedim.
I knew it wasn't him	Men onuň däldigini bilýärdim
Then he decided.	Soň bolsa karar berdi.
You must have seen it.	Siz ony gören bolmaly.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
I was there to enjoy	Men lezzet almak üçin şol ýerde boldum
Not interesting anymore.	Indi gyzykly däl.
There was only one thing about it.	Bu hakda diňe bir zat bardy.
This too.	Bu hem.
I called again	Men başga gezek jaň etdim
I thought it was time	Wagt geldi diýip pikir etdim
This gave him hope.	Bu oňa umyt berdi.
I have a problem.	Mende bir mesele bar.
I didn't need it anymore	Maňa indi gerek däldi
How is he	Ol nähili
Oh, very good.	Aý, gaty gowy.
It will be strange today.	Bu gün geň bolar.
It may take years.	Bize birnäçe ýyl gerek bolup biler.
I don’t think it’s the best idea to tell him.	Oňa aýtmak iň gowy pikir däl öýdemok.
I hope there is no problem	Mesele bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin
I could not answer that.	Men muňa jogap berip bilmedim.
Great, just great.	Ajaýyp, diňe ajaýyp.
I tried everything.	Men hemme zady synap gördüm.
It's good to see you here.	Seni şu ýerde görmek gowy zat.
I'm just there to get it	Men ony diňe almak üçin bar
This will be good for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy bolar.
I didn't know what to do with it	Munuň näme edip biljekdigini bilmeýärdim
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
He did it three times.	Üç gezek etdi.
There seems to be nothing here.	Bu ýerde bir zat ýok ýaly.
There is no hope, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Umyt ýok "-diýdi.
I don't do that	Men muny etmeýärin
I have heard this many times	Men muny birnäçe gezek eşitdim
I need it here	Maňa şu ýerde gerek
It's been here since yesterday	Düýn bäri şu ýerde

Bad!	Erbet!
New life.	Täze durmuş.
You are here.	Sen şu ýerde.
He can't even do it.	Ol hatda edip bilmeýär.
I don't think so	Men onuň hakda beýle pikir etmeli däl
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
I just had to get it	Men ony diňe almaly boldum
He was still there.	Ol henizem bardy.
You shouldn't and shouldn't do that.	Muny etmeli däl we etmeli däl.
It was very difficult for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty kyn boldy.
I'm not that.	Men ol däl.
No one could do what they really wanted to do.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam etjek bolýan zadyny edip bilmedi.
I couldn't think of it	Men bu hakda pikir edip bilmedim
That must be true.	Bu dogry bolmaly.
Not good anymore.	Indi gowy däl.
Then the next and the next.	Soň indiki we indiki.
I have to go today	Men şu gün gitmeli
I may be ready to leave tomorrow	Ertir gitmäge taýyn bolup bilerin
Maybe he can't do that anymore.	Belki, ol indi muny edip bilmez.
It's impossible to do that.	Muny etmek mümkin däl zat.
Then he will definitely come back here.	Soň bolsa hökman şu ýere gaýdyp geler.
He was right.	Ol muny dogry aýtdy.
I already knew about it	Men ol hakda eýýäm bilýärdim
There are more.	Has köp bolýar.
That could be a question.	Bu sorag bolup biler.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
Only you and I are there.	Diňe sen we men bar.
I will not be stupid	Men samsyk bolmaz
We can't both promise.	Ikimizem söz alyp bilmeris.
I didn't care.	Alada etmedim.
I didn't see it that way	Men ony beýle görmedim
It was not fast.	Bu çalt däldi.
I want her to help me	Men onuň maňa kömek etmegini isleýärin
This is really cool.	Bu çynlakaý ajaýyp.
It’s kind of weird and wonderful.	Bu bir hili geň we ajaýyp.
There was no other reason.	Başga bir sebäp ýokdy.
Maybe he wanted to do more.	Belki, köp zatlar etmegini isledi.
You can get it now.	Muny şu wagt alyp bilersiňiz.
That would be great.	Bu gaty uly bolardy.
Everything is beautiful and beautiful.	Hemme zat ajaýyp we owadan.

There was so much he didn't know.	Onuň bilmeýän köp zady bardy.
I couldn't see it	Men muny görüp bilmedim
I don't know anything about that	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilemok
It was hard to decide.	Karar bermek kyn boldy.
I think in the morning.	Irden pikir edýärin.
In fact, he did.	Aslynda şeýle etdi.
I just thought about it	Men bu hakda diňe pikir etdim
Not yet.	Entek ýok.

And then with the moon.	Soň bolsa aý bilen.

They still exist.	Olar henizem bar.

Probably a year.	Mümkin ýyl ýaly.
Many other things are not right.	Başga kän zat dogry däl.
I have to be there	Men ol ýerde bolmaly
I didn't really need it.	Maňa hakykatdanam gerek däldi.
He understood now.	Ol indi düşündi.
That would be really interesting	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly bolardy
It wasn't time yet.	Entek wagt däldi.
I helped him do that last year	Men oňa geçen ýyl muny etmäge kömek etdim
Once he was gone.	Bir gezek ol gitdi.
In fact, it is more.	Aslynda bu has köp zat.
Here it comes now.	Ine, indi gelýär.

Great thing.	Uly zat.
He knew he didn't have to.	Bolmaly däldigini bilýärdi.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
Not necessarily money.	Hökman pul däl.
The most interesting.	Iň gyzykly.
One person answered.	Bir adam jogap berdi.
There will be no other way.	Başga ýol bolmaz.
He did not want to harm.	Ol zyýan bermek islemedi.
This will help.	Bu kömek eder.
That is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle bolmaly däl.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
No one else is going to do that.	Başga hiç kim muny etjek däl.
I haven't been able to get to him yet	Men henizem oňa baryp bilmedim
He is coming.	Ol gelýär.
That's bad news.	Ol erbet habar.
Needless to say.	Indi aýtmaly däl.
And then it gets serious.	Soň bolsa çynlakaý bolýar.
I knew he was thinking of something	Men onuň bir zat hakda pikir edýändigini bilýärdim
He wanted to help.	Kömek etmek isledi.
You can only get it.	Diňe alyp bilersiňiz.
That's what he called you.	Ine, ol saňa jaň etdi.
You need to rest a little	Biraz dynç almaly
I shouldn’t have been so hard	Men beýle kyn bolmaly däldim
No one can come to me	Hiç kim maňa baryp bilmez
This has been a very difficult year for me.	Bu, meniň üçin gaty kyn ýyl boldy.
It wasn't that good.	Bu beýle gowy däldi.
I got a little mistake or something	Biraz ýalňyşlyk ýa-da bir zat aldym
There is a very good reason.	Gaty gowy sebäp bar.
It has to be bad for every good time.	Her gowy wagt üçin erbet bolmaly.
I still can't answer	Men henizem jogap berip bilmedim
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
She wanted to have fun.	Ol hezil etjek boldy.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
That was no longer the question.	Indi bu sorag däldi.
I can't even do it.	Men hatda edip bilemok.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
I didn't know anything else	Men başga zady bilmeýärdim
It will be next.	Indiki bolar.
I immediately bought one.	Men derrew birini satyn aldym.
New.	Täze.
Who is not	Kim däl.
Now he had something to do.	Indi onuň etmeli bir işi bardy.
Can he even see?	Ol hatda görüp bilýärmi?
No one could tell me what to do.	Hiç kim maňa näme etmelidigimi aýdyp bilmedi.
It was hard for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin kyn boldy.
It was today.	Bu gün boldy.
I allowed him to do whatever he wanted	Men oňa islän zadyny etmäge rugsat berdim
And so it was.	Ol hem şeýle boldy.
This is me	Bu özüm.
I have an idea right now	Mende şu wagt bir pikir bar
And for some as a baby gets older, he or she will outgrow this	Bir gyz bolsa, beýle köp iş edip bilmedi
New day	Täze gün.
I have to go to the police today.	Men şu gün polisiýa gitmeli.
That's it.	Munuň özi.
He did not want to harm anyone.	Ol hiç kime zyýan bermek islemedi.
We are for them.	Biz olar üçin.
He called.	Ol jaň etdi.
There is a better way.	Has gowy ýol bar.
I would agree with that	Men muňa razy bolaryn
No one had thought about it before	Bu barada öň hiç kim pikir etmedi
That happens a lot.	Bu gaty köp bolýar.
Me and something else, something else	Men we başga bir zat, başga bir zat boldum
They will be.	Olar bolar.
He made her happy.	Ony bagtly etdi.
He must be ready.	Ol taýyn bolmaly.
he thought	diýip pikir etdi
I can do anything for you	Men seni her zat edip bilerin
She was worried.	Ol alada galdy.

Of course, nothing will happen.	Elbetde, hiç zat bolmaz.
It's too bad.	Ol gaty erbet.

What happened	Näme boldy?
Sorry, this is too bad.	Bagyşlaň, bu gaty erbet.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I thought it would help	Kömek eder öýdüpdim
I want to tell him.	Men oňa aýtmak isleýärin.
I knew what he was doing	Men onuň näme edýändigini bilýärdim
No one wants to.	Hiç kim islemeýär.
The problem is with him.	Mesele onuň bilen.
There was no other option.	Başga mümkinçilik ýokdy.
Now he was not.	Indi ol beýle däldi.
No one knows everything.	Hiç kim hemme zady bilmeýär.
He is not good.	Ol gowy däl.
I couldn't tell anyone	Hiç kime aýdyp bilmedim
This is a bit strange.	Bu birneme geň.
It was then.	Şol wagt boldy.
I can't see how this happened	Munuň nähili bolandygyny görüp bilemok
He could not promise.	Ol söz berip bilmedi.
There was no sound.	Ses ýokdy.
I know, but it's not good	Bilýärin, ýöne ol gowy däl
I think this would be a great book.	Bu gaty gowy kitap bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
He really needs to do something about it.	Ol hakykatdanam bu barada bir zat etmeli.
He never did that.	Ol muny hiç wagt etmedi.
I couldn't say anything else	Başga bir zat aýdyp bilmedim
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
Now I hope he can really think.	Indi hakykatdanam pikir edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
I do not have.	Mende ýok.
I'm not very good.	Men kän gowy däl.
I thought it was good	Gowy diýip pikir etdim

Oh, he will be very happy.	Aý, ol gaty bagtly bolar.
This will not happen.	Bu bolmaz.
You have to answer it.	Oňa jogap bermeli.
I do this completely for you	Men muny doly siziň üçin edýärin
I probably have nothing to do with it	Mende onuň bilen hiç zat ýok bolsa gerek
This is also a lie.	Bu hem ýalan.
I don't think so	Diňe şeýle bolar öýdemok
More	Has köp.
The same is true with us.	Edil şol bir zat biziň bilen.
He seemed lonely.	Ol ýeke ýalydy.
That sounds great.	Bu gaty gowy ýaly.
It doesn't have to be one.	Bir bolmaly däl.
Everything is here	Bu ýerde hemme zat bar
No way.	Bolmaz.
No one seems to be home.	Hiç kim öýde däl ýaly.
It wasn't long.	Uzak däldi.
We can do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly edip bileris.
This is stupid.	Bu samsyk.
That's all there is to it.	Bar etmeli zady.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
All the way	Bütin ýol.
I just thought of something	Men diňe bir zat hakda pikir etdim
He did not want to know that.	Ol muny bilmek islemedi.

Many, many years now.	Köp, indi köp ýyl.
It would be great.	Ol gaty ajaýyp bolardy.
Of course we can't.	Elbetde edip bilmeris.

I didn't see it that badly	Men muny beýle erbet görmedim
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
He had to do it.	Ol etmeli boldy.
I can do anything.	Men hemme zady edip bilerin.
A lot of people do that	Köp adam muny edýär
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there. "	Ol beýle däl "-diýdi.
The only reason for this was.	Munuň ýaly ýeke-täk sebäp boldy.
It's actually the same issue.	Aslynda şol bir mesele.

It took a year.	Bir ýyl gerek boldy.
That may be true.	Dogry bolup biler.
I must have done this a few hours ago.	Men muny birnäçe sagat öň eden bolmaly.
I hope this is true for everyone	Bu hemmeler üçin dogry bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I really enjoyed it	Mundan gaty lezzet aldym
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
He agreed.	Ol muňa razy boldy.
He then resigned.	Soň bolsa işden çykdy.
For a few days.	Birnäçe gün bäri.
It would be necessary.	Zerur bolardy.
He had some hope	Oňa ýene birneme umyt geldi
I got it once	Men ony bir gezek aldym
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa ýol bermedi.
This is not for me.	Bu meniň üçin däl.
Here's another one.	Ine, başga biri.
It's been a long time coming.	Bu köp wagt boldy.
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
Interesting about that.	Bu hakda gyzykly.

I can't think of them	Men olar hakda pikir edip bilemok
We are good at it.	Biz muňa gowy.
There is so much to do.	Ol ýerde gaty köp zat bar.
I couldn't sleep thinking about you yesterday	Düýn sen hakda pikir edip uklap bilmedim

I don't know what's going on there	Ol ýerde näme bardygyny bilemok
It was the best decision.	Iň gowy karar boldy.
I have to tell him something else	Men oňa başga bir zat aýtmaly
This book helped me go easier.	Bu kitap maňa has aňsat gitmäge kömek etdi.
There is nothing to pay attention to.	Üns bermeli zat ýok.
More is coming.	Has köp zat gelýär.

It was not there at the time.	Şol wagt ýokdy.
Then he went home.	Soň bolsa öýüne bardy.
I thought about it.	Men bu barada pikir etdim.
I want to give myself up	Men özümi bermek isleýärin
I didn't know he was going to do it	Men onuň muny etjekdigini bilmeýärdim
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
I didn’t need it yet, but it was young at night	Maňa entek gerek däldi, ýöne gije ýaş
I've never seen this before.	Öň muny görmedim.
You are in one place today, somewhere else tomorrow.	Sen şu gün bir ýerde, ertir başga bir ýerde.
You are right now	Sen şu wagt

She is also beautiful.	Ol hem owadan.
Not everyone.	Her bir adam hem däl.
I will not need any help	Maňa hiç hili kömek gerek bolmaz
In fact, it was impossible.	Aslynda bu mümkin däldi.
It's always been, maybe it will always be.	Elmydama boldy, belki hemişe bolar.
This is not a bad idea.	Bu erbet pikir däl.
I must have arrested you	Men seni tussag eden bolmaly
More interesting.	Has gyzykly.
I don't believe that	Men muňa ynanamok
I'm not ready for that	Men muňa taýyn däl

Here it is today.	Ine, şu gün.
And he was good to us.	Ol bolsa bize gowy boldy.
Couldn't be.	Bolup bilmedi.
Tonight, if possible.	Şu gije, mümkin bolsa.
This seems very strange.	Bu gaty geň görünýär.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, muny etmeli.
I heard that.	Men muny eşitdim.
I gave him a job.	Men oňa iş berdim.
This is not advice.	Bu maslahat däl.
Not really surprising.	Hakykatdanam geň däl.
Nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýok.
It’s still crazy, but the only way.	Bu henizem däli, ýöne ýeke-täk ýol.
I need to do more.	Men has köp zat etmeli.
He would be.	Ol bolardy.
He asked me what he could do.	Ol menden näme edip biljekdigini sorady.
That would be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolardy.
Great thing, just the same.	Ajaýyp zat, edil şol bir zat.
Hope is good.	Umyt gowy.
Nothing can be worse.	Hiç zat erbet bolup bilmez.
I have done this several times.	Men muny birnäçe gezek etdim.
Just what helped me.	Diňe maňa kömek eden zat.
He doesn't even know it.	Ony özi hem bilmeýär.
It's fast and easy.	Bu çalt we aňsat.
I knew better than that	Men mundan has gowy bilýärdim
It took a while.	Biraz wagt aldy.
I just told him he couldn't take it.	Men oňa diňe ony alyp bilmejekdigini aýtdym.
I didn’t know what could happen at the time.	Şol wagt näme bolup biljekdigini bilmeýärdim.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
And that's not the case.	We beýle däl.
Summer is here.	Tomus geldi.
I think he already was	Meniň pikirimçe, ol öňem bardy
This is just advice.	Bu diňe maslahat.
Okay, maybe that should be the case.	Bolýar, belki şeýle bolmaly.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Maybe one thing or another.	Belki bir zat ýa-da bir zat.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Maybe there is a reason for that.	Belki munuň bir sebäbi bar.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat däldi.
I've never done that before.	Men muny ozal etmedim.
I can do that	Men muny edip bilerin
Okay, no big deal.	Bolýar, uly mesele ýok.
It's actually worse.	Aslynda has erbet.
It takes life.	Munuň üçin durmuş gerek.
Of course it can.	Elbetde bolup biler.
He didn't do anything easy for me.	Ol meniň üçin aňsat zat etmedi.
You have to get another job	Başga bir iş almaly
You're home again.	Sen ýene öýde.
The idea was not new.	Bu pikir düýbünden täze däldi.
I thought it was great	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim
Not a word.	Bir söz däl.
I thought there was some hope.	Biraz umyt bar öýdüpdim.
I have it and it looks great	Mende bar we gaty gowy görünýär
I didn't want to do that	Men muny etmek islemedim
The last thing you want is something else.	Iň soňky isleýän zady başga.
It's hard to do well	Ony gowy etmek kyn
Really one of the most.	Hakykatdanam, iň köp biri.
We are happy for that.	Munuň üçin biz bagtly.
This time.	Sagat iki.
I had a lot of opportunities	Mende gaty köp mümkinçilik bardy
I think that's a good question now.	Meniň pikirimçe, indi bu gowy sorag.
I can't see much.	Men gaty görüp bilemok.
It just seems right.	Diňe dogry ýaly.
I didn’t want to hurt him anymore	Mundan beýläk oňa zyýan bermek islemedim
I think that's the word	Meniň pikirimçe, bu söz
He said he was not happy.	Ol özüniň bagtly ýaly däldigini aýtdy.
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
I'm worried about that.	Men muňa alada edýärin.
Hard and relaxing.	Gaty we dynç.
I think they are great	Meniň pikirimçe, olar gaty gowy
I didn't know what it would be like	Munuň nähili boljakdygyny bilmedim
Maybe you should do that.	Belki muny etmeli.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
I never knew he could do these things	Bu zatlary edip biljekdigini hiç wagt bilmeýärdim
I had to go home and rest	Öýe gidip dynç almaly boldum
It took two hours.	Iki sagat gerek boldy.
I thought it was very good and very smart	Gaty gowy we gaty akylly diýip pikir etdim
He tried to help	Kömek etjek boldy
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
It was not a call.	Bu jaň däldi.
Of course not here.	Elbetde, bu ýerde ýok.
Already happy	Öňem bagtly.
There was no good news.	Iň gowy habar ýokdy.
I wish you all the best tonight	Şu gije bize gowy zat isleýärin
I called him every hour, but he didn't answer	Men oňa her sagat jaň etdim, ýöne jogap bermedi
I want to be clear.	Aýdyň bolmak isleýärin.
I can't talk like that.	Mende beýle gürleşmek bolmaz.
Not a lot of ideas.	Köp pikir däl.
It was just one night.	Bu diňe bir gije boldy.
Good.	Gowy.
I only have one.	Mende diňe bar.
I didn't mind	Men birneme garşy däldim
Stop now	Indi bes et.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
OK, maybe not.	Bolýar, belki ýok.
I haven't thought about it for years	Birnäçe ýyl bäri bu hakda pikir etmedim
And then again.	Soň bolsa ýene.
Not very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly däl.
It still is.	Ol henizem şeýle boldy.
I can't let him do that	Men oňa muny etmäge rugsat berip bilemok
I have to.	Mende bolmaly.
It was almost impossible to do.	Edip bilmejekdigini diýen ýalydy.
Of course, this was not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däldi.
They look really cool.	Olar hakykatdanam ajaýyp görünýär.
I think that made him crazy	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ony däli etdi
I don't think anything will come of it	Hiç zat geler öýdemok
There is no help for that.	Munuň üçin kömek ýok.
No more.	Indi ýok.
I had enough for him one day	Men oňa bir gün ýeterlik boldum
This was not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däldi.
It really does exist.	Hakykatdanam bar.
I have a lot to do	Meniň etmeli köp zadym bar
Today	Şu gün.
That's a lot about me.	Bu meniň hakda gaty köp.
He was never there.	Ol hiç wagt ýokdy.
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu dogry däl.
You have to do well in the morning.	Irden gowy etmeli.
It just looks right.	Diňe dogry görünýär.
I'm not like that anymore	Men indi beýle däldim
In fact, they are not.	Aslynda olar ýok.
I decided	Men karar berdim
I didn't see anyone.	Men hiç kimi görmedim.
For this.	Munuň üçin.
It turned out to be very hard.	Ol gaty gaty ýaly diýen ýaly çykdy.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy boldy.
It shouldn't be right.	Dogry bolmaly däl.
I am still myself.	Men henizem özüm.
No one can take it from you.	Hiç kim muny senden alyp bilmez.
Just to talk.	Diňe gürleşmek üçin.
Not even the future.	Geljek hem däl.
I just don't need it	Maňa diňe gerek bolmaz
I haven't seen you in a few weeks	Birnäçe hepde bäri seni görmedim
No one was, was and is.	Hiç kim ýok, bardy we bar.
And then he really started to worry.	Soň bolsa hakykatdanam alada edip başlady.
I think that's a good thing	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy zat
What am i	Men näme?
Everyone has time.	Her kimiň wagty bar.
I'm just scared one day	Men diňe bir gün gorkýaryn
He had something to do.	Onuň etmeli zatlary bardy.
Everyone else is somewhere else.	Hemmeler munuň bilen başga ýerde.
I'm just a guy.	Men diňe bir ýigit.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
That's right.	Bu dogry zat.
I had nothing to worry about	Alada etjek zadym ýokdy
That's right.	Dogry.
Man, you have the greatest time.	Adam, sen iň uly wagt.
Tell me what happened.	Näme bolandygyny aýdyň.
There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
It looks interesting, of course.	Elbetde gyzykly görünýär.
You have to admit that	Muny boýun almaly
That may be true.	Dogry bolup biler.
I can tell her about you and me	Men oňa sen we men hakda aýdyp bilerin
You are not	Sen beýle däl
I only have one person for work	Mende diňe iş üçin adam bar
I can't be with a man	Men adam bilen bolup bilemok
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Munuň kömek etmejekdigini bilýärdi.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
He could not see it for himself.	Muny özi görüp bilmedi.
I am such a happy girl !!.	Men şeýle bagtly gyz !!.
I didn't know anything else	Men başga zady bilmeýärdim
I bought a new one last year	Geçen ýyl täze satyn aldym
That's exactly what happened	Bu düýbünden şeýle boldy
I'm not like that anymore	Men indi beýle däl
No one can have fun.	Hiç kim hezil edip bilenok.
I never did that.	Men asla beýle etmedim.
I can't allow it right now	Men şu wagt rugsat berip bilemok
I hope this doesn't bother you too much	Bu sizi gaty biynjalyk etmeýär diýip umyt edýärin
I didn't know that	Men muny bilmedim
He was a little crazy.	Biraz däli boldy.
I didn't want to go to a party	Oturylyşyga gitmek islemedim
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilenok.
I couldn't think of anything else	Başga zat hakda pikir edip bilmedim
I gave	Men berdim
On the ground	Ýerde.
Whatever you want	Islän zady.
He will be you	Ol sen bolar
You can call it a good life.	Gowy durmuş diýip bilersiňiz.
Good things can still happen.	Gowy zatlar henizem bolup biler.
Of course I couldn't.	Elbetde edip bilmedim.
He has to leave today.	Ol şu gün gitmeli.
Not much time.	Wagt kän däldi.
He doesn't know.	Ol bilmeýär.
He had to go.	Ol gitmeli boldy.
I can't see it	Men muny görüp bilemok
Very good offer	Gaty gowy teklip
I didn’t really think it could be right	Aslynda dogry bolup biler diýip pikir etmedim
I'll call you	Men size jaň ederin
I knew what this could do.	Munuň näme edip biljekdigini bilýärdim.
This is no longer possible.	Indi bu mümkin däl.
I just need time	Maňa diňe wagt gerek
We need help.	Bize kömek gerek.
It helped me a lot.	Bu maňa uly kömek etdi.
And he promised that today would be the best day.	We şu gün iň gowy gün boljakdygyna söz berdi.
He could not think so.	Ol beýle pikir edip bilmedi.
Sounds like a good thing.	Gowy bir zat ýaly.
I was not here for myself	Men bu ýerde özüm üçin däldim
A young man a few years ago.	Birnäçe ýyl ozal bir ýigit.
It seems to me like money.	Bu maňa pul ýaly bolup görünýär.
I don't want to do that.	Men, muny etmek islämok.
Strange and wonderful.	Geň we ajaýyp zat.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim
We are not like that yet.	Biz entek beýle däl.
I need to be a better person	Men has gowy adam bolmaly
What do I think about me that causes this?	Muňa sebäp bolýan meniň hakda näme hakda pikir edýärin.
I can do many things	Men köp zatlar edip bilerin
I think he knows everything.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hemme zady bilýär.
He knows where he wants to be.	Nirede bolmak isleýändigini bilýär.
He doesn't want that either.	Ol hem muny islemeýär.
I didn't really think so	Aslynda beýle pikir etmedim
I want it here tomorrow	Ertir ony şu ýerde isleýärin
It’s hard to think of anything else	Başga zat hakda pikir etmek kyn
Of course there is.	Elbetde bar.
This is not the biggest issue.	Munuň özi iň uly mesele däl.
I couldn't give myself to him	Men oňa özümi berip bilmedim
He didn't want to think about it right now.	Ol edil häzir onuň hakda pikir etmek islemedi.
It's great to see you here.	Seni şu ýerde görmek gaty gowy.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
He said it was enough.	Ol ýeterlik diýdi.
This can be difficult.	Bu kyn bolup biler.
I was not ready for that	Men muňa taýyn däldim
Of course, that was no longer the case.	Elbetde, bu indi dogry däldi.
Morning and night.	Irden we gije.
Work.	Iş.
I'm better now	Men häzir has gowy
If there is anything else.	Başga bir zat bar bolsa.
This is not much.	Bu kän däl.
Everyone wants something new and new.	Her kim täze we täze bir zat isleýär.
I had no such thing.	Mende beýle zat ýokdy.
We are close to him.	Biz oňa ýakyn.
I had to do something about it.	Men bu barada bir zat etmeli boldum.
I don't think so.	Beýle bolmaz öýdemok.
I can do it again	Men ýene edip bilerin
Couldn't have been better.	Has gowy bolup bilmedi.
I answered, "She is beautiful."	Men jogap berdim, ol owadan diýdi
I saw worse.	Men has erbet gördüm.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
I'll be there	Men şol ýerde bolaryn
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
I could do nothing for him	Men onuň üçin hiç zat edip bilmedim
I said there was more	Has köp zadyň bardygyny aýtdym
I'm sorry, man.	Bagyşlaň, adam.
She is not at home.	Ol öýde däl.
I didn't know what he knew	Men onuň bilýän zadyny bilmedim
Today is a new day.	Bu gün täze gün.
I knew he wasn't far away	Men onuň uzak däldigini bilýärdim
No one was there	Hiç kim köp däldi
I never saw him.	Men ony hiç wagt görmedim.
He is not ready yet.	Ol entek taýyn däl.
I'll be there again	Men ýene şol ýerde bolaryn
It just seemed to me possible.	Bu diňe maňa mümkin ýalydy.
This is him.	Bu onuň özi.
It was not an easy year.	Bu aňsat ýyl däldi.
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
So we can definitely see things.	Şonuň üçin zatlary hökman görüp bileris.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I have seen this issue once	Bu meseläni bir gezek gördüm
I saw enough.	Men ýeterlik gördüm.
It's been a long night.	Bu gije uly wagt boldy.
I was not good for such a person	Men beýle adam üçin gowy däldim
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
It could be.	Bu bolup biler.
I didn't know anyone was there	Men ol ýerde hiç kimiň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
I don’t know what he wants to talk about	Näme hakda gürleşmek isleýändigini bilemok
Do you believe	Ynanýarsyňyzmy?
I hope not.	Bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
I did it	Men muny etdim
I had to call the police	Men polisiýa jaň etmeli boldum
Crazy for that.	Munuň üçin däli.
I can take you home in the morning	Men seni irden öýe alyp bilerin
The song is not for today.	Aýdym şu gün üçin däl.
I must have done that	Men muny eden bolmaly
I need it tomorrow morning	Maňa ertir irden gerek
This may be the first for me.	Bu meniň üçin ilkinji bolup biler.
I'm here for you	Men seniň üçin şu ýerde
I still can't see anyone	Men henizem hiç kimi görüp bilemok
I have to hope for that	Men muňa umyt etmeli
It happens every hour, every day.	Her sagat, her gün bolýar.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
This is either us or them.	Bu ýa-da biz ýa-da olar.
This is great news.	Bu ajaýyp habar.
I have nothing to do	Etjek zadym ýok
True, no one knows when it will happen.	Dogry, haçan boljakdygyny hiç kim bilenok.
Why is that?	Näme üçin beýle bolýar?
An idea came to him	Oňa bir pikir geldi
A lot of things are great.	Köp zat gaty gowy.
I want it very badly.	Men ony gaty erbet isleýärin.
Tomorrow may be a difficult day.	Ertir kyn gün bolup biler.
I think it will help	Bu kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin
There is no other word for this.	Munuň üçin başga söz ýok.
It was like the sun and the moon for him.	Onuň üçin gün we aý ýalydy.
Not much there.	Ol ýerde kän däl.
I made a strange decision that day	Şol gün geň bir karar berdim
He does the same.	Edil şol bir zady edýär.
Men.	Men.
They are us.	Olar biz.
I really do this for you	Men muny hakykatdanam siziň üçin edýärin
It's never about me.	Bu hiç wagt men hakda däl.
It's been a long day, of course.	Elbetde, uzak gün boldy.
That's all there is to it.	Hakykatdanam ol hakda hemme zat.
Nothing like it is now.	Häzirki ýaly zat ýok.
I can't have too much.	Mende gaty köp zat bolup bilmez.
Of course not.	Elbetde, bilmeýär.
That may be true today.	Bu gün dogry bolup biler.
This is a very difficult thing.	Bu gaty kyn zat.
I want to see you again	Seni ýene görmek isleýärin
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
Just a question.	Diňe bir sorag.
The reason.	Sebäp.
This is almost impossible.	Bu mümkin däl diýen ýaly.
No more questions.	Indi sorag ýok.
I agree. "	Men razy "-diýdi
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu sebäp boldy.
You may need three.	Size üç gerek bolup biler.
I'll take care of you	Men sen hakda alada ederin
I couldn't get this job	Bu işi alyp bilmedim
I did nothing wrong here	Men bu ýerde hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedim
I didn't think so	Men mundan başga pikir etmedim
This is the largest.	Bu iň uly.
We don't have to.	Biz hökman däl.
It was new.	Bu täze boldy.
Not myself.	Meniň özüm däl.
I did it for him.	Men onuň üçin etdim.
He is another bad man.	Ol başga bir erbet adam.
I hope you are very happy.	Siz gaty bagtly bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin.
You know that.	Muny bilýärsiň.
I was surprised	Geň gördüm
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
A little	Biraz.
I think so	Meniň pikirimçe, şeýle edýär
How strange.	Nähili geň.
He said yours.	Ol seniň diýdi.
Neither did he.	Şeýle hem etmedi.
In fact, he could see everything.	Aslynda hemme zady görüp bilýärdi.
I was ready this time.	Men bu gezek taýyn boldum.
I can't destroy what I don't have	Men ýok zady ýok edip bilemok
I have seen a lot and I can help you	Köp zady gördüm we size kömek edip bilerin
I knew nothing about him	Men ol hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
There is no help for this now.	Häzir munuň üçin kömek ýok.
A long way to school every day.	Her gün mekdebe uzak ýol.
I never wanted anyone else	Men hiç haçan başga birini islemedim
This does not help.	Bu kömek etmeýär.
Stupid, but not that stupid.	Samsyk, ýöne beýle samsyk däl.
Because he was there.	Sebäbi ol bardy.
I'll think about it	Men bu barada pikir ederin
I was not there	Men ol ýerde däldim
It's somewhere.	Ol bir ýerde.
When i did	Haçan etmedim.
It was as if no one else knew.	Mundan başga hiç kim muny bilmeýän ýalydy.
I hope today is a better day for you	Bu gün siziň üçin has gowy gün diýip umyt edýärin
I know he will	Etjekdigini bilýärin
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
I cared for you	Men seniň üçin alada etdim
It didn't hurt me.	Bu maňa zyýan bermedi.
He ignored it.	Ol muňa üns bermedi.
It was difficult.	Kyn boldy.
They are very difficult.	Olar gaty kyn.
I still do.	Men henizem edýärin.
Of course, too much.	Elbetde, gaty köp.
I do not know.	Men bilemok.
Then he voted.	Soň bolsa ses berdi.
I couldn't do it alone	Men muny ýeke edip bilmedim
It's easy to obey.	Oňa boýun bolmak aňsat.
Not really.	Aslynda ýok.
This is a completely different problem.	Bu düýbünden başga kynçylyk.
It's been a while.	Birneme wagt boldy.
Now you know what to do.	Indi näme etmelidigini bilýärsiň.
Then it was not necessary.	Soň hökman däldi.
This may take some time.	Bu birneme wagt bolup biler.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
I didn’t really want to know.	Aslynda bilmek islemedim.
.	.
It should never have happened.	Hiç haçan bolmaly däldi.
This word is happy.	Bu söz bagtly.
This seems strange to me.	Bu maňa geň görünýär.
Only he seemed to be gone.	Diňe ol ýok ýalydy.
In fact, I had nothing	Aslynda mende hiç zat ýokdy
It's not everywhere, every time.	Ol hemme ýerde, her gezek bolmaly ýaly däl.
I've been with everyone	Hemmeler bilen boldum
Offered.	Teklip etdi.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Of course not now.	Elbetde häzir däl.
He never did.	Hiç haçan etmedi.
And he came out this week.	Şu hepde bolsa şu ýere çykdy.
I had no such thing anymore	Mende indi beýle zat ýokdy
I beg you	Men senden haýyş edýärin
I think things can always be bad	Meniň pikirimçe, zatlar hemişe erbet bolup biler
I don't think so	Men pikirimçe beýle däl
I got a new book yesterday	Düýn täze kitap aldym
This is not the case.	Bu däl.
Too many now.	Häzir gaty köp.
I didn’t care about anything or anyone	Men hiç zat ýa-da hiç kim hakda alada etmedim
I didn't think that would happen	Munuň boljakdygyny pikir etmedim
It will be easy.	Bu aňsat bolar.
It didn't tell me much.	Bu maňa kän zat aýtmady.
At home, he hoped.	Öýde, umyt etdi.
He said it was often there.	Ol köplenç şol ýerde bolýar diýdi.
None is easy and none is immediate.	Hiç biri aňsat däl we hiç biri derrew däl.
He thought it would be easy to give.	Bermek nähili aňsat bolar diýip pikir etdi.
Just what comes.	Diňe näme gelýär.
Very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly.
It's too early to tell.	Muny aýtmak ir.
I think you can take me home	Meni öýe alyp bilersiňiz diýip pikir edýärin
He never said that.	Ol muny hiç haçan aýtmady.
It often takes time.	Köplenç wagt gerek.
I have to destroy it	Men ony ýok etmeli
He did.	Ol şeýle etdi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, beýle däl.
The idea was not always there	Bu pikir hemişe ýokdy
He wanted to take her.	Ol alyp gitmek isledi.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
We can never get another one.	Hiç haçan başga birini alyp bilmeris.
And then another.	Soň bolsa başga.
I didn't know what it was like	Men onuň nähili bolandygyny bilmedim
Stupid, young, me.	Samsyk, ýaş, men.
Maybe even the best two.	Belki hatda iň gowy iki.
I just have to be myself	Men diňe özüm bolmaly
Every night there was another reason	Her gije başga bir sebäp bardy
I want to rest there.	Men ol ýere dynç almak isleýärin.
It came out.	Çykdy.
This did not happen.	Bu bolup bilmedi.
I know, I just thought of one	Bilýän, men diňe birini pikir etdim
There seemed to be no help for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili kömek ýok ýalydy.
I couldn't think of that	Men beýle pikir edip bilmedim
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
It's a long way off.	Bu uzak ýol.
I never thought of it that way	Men muny asla pikir etmedim
Whatever you want	Islän zady.
You are there.	Sen şol ýerde.
It's easy and fun!	Bu aňsat we gyzykly!.
It's kind of bad.	Bu bir hili erbet.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
I really have to go	Men hakykatdanam gitmeli
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
It may take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek bolup biler.
He could not do that.	Muny edip bilmedi.
Good!	Gowy!
I think he is a good man.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gowy adam.
That's all I had to do	Men muny diňe şeýle etmeli boldum
This is also available.	Bu hem bar.
I can do something there	Men ol ýerde bir zatlar edip bilerin
I didn't know how	Men nädip bilmedim
About being with someone.	Kimdir biri bilen bolmak hakda.
I've been there for the last month.	Men soňky bir aý bäri boldum.
He could not do that.	Muny edip bilmedi.
He has not done so for years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri beýle etmedi.
I'm serious	Men düýbünden çynlakaý
So it should be.	Şonuň üçin şeýle bolmaly.
He wanted it.	Ol muny isledi.
We need.	Biz zerur.
I think about it every day.	Men ony her gün pikir edýärin.
He did the same.	Şeýle hem etdi.
He was alone, he knew a lot.	Ol ýeke boldy, muny köp bilýärdi.
That's what I did with them.	Men olar bilen şeýle boldum.
I can't sleep	Men uklap bilemok
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
Now or never.	Indi ýa-da hiç haçan.
I just can't stop thinking about you	Diňe sen hakda pikir etmegi bes edip bilemok
I will not be that person	Men ol adam bolmaz
Not too long.	Gaty uzak däl.
I hope this helps a little	Bu birneme kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin
I think that could be the problem.	Bu mesele bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I can't give you anything	Men saňa hiç zat berip bilemok
I am just a man	Men diňe bir adam
It should be what you need	Size gerek zat bolmaly
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şonuň ýaly.
I often think of you.	Men sen hakda köplenç pikir edýärin.
It seemed serious.	Çynlakaý ýalydy.
I wasn't there the day before	Bir gün öň ol ýerde däldim
In fact, there would be plenty.	Aslynda, elbetde, köp bolardy.
There is better work there.	Ol ýerde has gowy iş bar.
Now something else.	Indi başga zat.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
It's a good idea to take another chance.	Başga bir mümkinçilik almak gowy zat.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
I don't know yet	Men entek bilmedim
I really can't answer right now.	Men hakykatdanam şu wagt jogap berip bilemok.
I don't know what happened to me.	Mende näme bolandygyny bilemok.
There is a reason for everything.	Hemme zadyň sebäbi bar.
I saw strange things and then everyone came back	Geň zatlary gördüm, soň hemmeler gaýdyp geldi
You can do those things.	Şol zatlary edip bilersiňiz.
It's really beautiful.	Bu hakykatdanam owadan.
Get help	Kömek almak
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
It will help him.	Oňa kömek eder.
Everything will be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolar.
A little stupid.	Biraz samsyk.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
Not for the money.	Pul üçin däl.
I have no high hopes	Mende uly umyt ýok
I've been there for a while	Biraz wagt boldum
This is great for him.	Bu onuň üçin ajaýyp.
It was today.	Bu gün boldy.
No need.	Gerek däl.
Same every day.	Her gün şol bir.
I thought it was beautiful too	Bu hem gaty owadan diýip pikir etdim
Where is he	Ol nirede.
I have something else	Mende başga bir zat bar
There is no time this morning.	Şu gün irden wagt ýok.
Himself.	Özi.
He could see nothing.	Ol hiç zady görüp bilmedi.
He also said he wanted one.	Ol hem birini isleýändigini aýtdy.
She is very smart.	Ol gaty akylly.
A lot of people just want a good answer.	Köp adam diňe gowy jogap almak isleýär.
I already have.	Men eýýäm bar.
He did not report earlier.	Ol ozal habar bermedi.
I hope it doesn't get there.	Ol ýerde bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
He doesn't know much about anything.	Ol hiç zat hakda köp zat bilmeýär.
This is very bad advice.	Bu gaty erbet maslahat.
I was not like that at the time	Men ol wagt beýle däldim
It will be great there.	Ol ýerde gaty gowy bolar.
He said no.	Ol ýok diýdi.
Only one thing can happen.	Diňe bir zat bolup biler.
You don't have to worry about the future.	Geljek hakda alada etmeli däl.
This is an issue now.	Bu indi bir mesele.
He did just that.	Edil şonuň ýaly etdi.
This is great news.	Bu ajaýyp habar.
I can take some time	Biraz wagt alyp bilerin
I had to do something about it	Bu hakda bir zat etmeli boldum
Buying one thing or another.	Bir zady ýa-da başga zady satyn almak.
Of course, there is news here.	Elbetde, bu ýerde habar bar.
I can't tell you yet	Size entek aýdyp biljek däl
I will be here	Men şu ýerde bolaryn
We don't have to.	Biz hökman däl.
He was good to me.	Ol maňa gowy boldy.
He may be young.	Ol ýaş bolup biler.
I can't even call right now	Men hatda häzir jaň edip bilemok
I think there were a lot of people	Meniň pikirimçe, köp adam bardy
I just want to be with her forever	Men diňe onuň bilen hemişe bile bolmak isleýärin
I want time.	Wagt isleýärin.
This worries me the most.	Bu gitmek meni iň biynjalyk edýär.
It was good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy boldy.
That's right.	Dogry.
I just want to do everything.	Men diňe hemme zady etmek isleýärin.
Someone was here.	Bu ýerde kimdir biri bardy.
It will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek.
Most.	Iň köp.
Of course, there was someone in this house.	Elbetde, bu öýde kimdir biri bardy.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
I'm not ready for that	Men muňa taýyn däl
He went very well.	Ol gaty gowy gitdi.
The problem was time.	Mesele wagt boldy.
He wanted it.	Ol muny isledi.
He knows about you.	Ol sen hakda bilýär.
I haven't seen him much.	Men ony kän görmedim.
I really want to talk to you	Men hakykatdanam siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
You can see it.	Ony görüp bilersiňiz.
I promised it would be the last	Men onuň iň soňky boljakdygyna söz berdim
I think it's gone now	Häzir gitdi öýdýän
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
Now.	Häzir.
I would like to have a rest here	Bu ýerde dynç almak isleýärin
I have to go now.	Men häzir gitmeli.
Everyone was there.	Ol ýerde hemmeler bardy.
That's all you have to do.	Bu seniň etmeli zadyň.
He couldn't help it.	Ol oňa kömek edip bilmedi.
I was crazy yesterday	Düýn däli boldum
Of course he was there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde bardy.
There is nothing new about this.	Bu barada täze zat ýok.
He told the truth.	Ol hakykaty aýtdy.
This time we can do better.	Bu gezek has gowy edip bileris.
About it.	Bu barada.
I thought it was great	Bu gaty gowy diýip pikir etdim
Just beautiful.	Diňe owadan.
I don't think so	Men beýle pikir etmeli däl
I couldn't tell her what to do	Men oňa näme etmelidigini aýdyp bilmedim
I stayed with him for a few more hours	Men onuň bilen ýene birnäçe sagat boldum
He didn't seem happy.	Ol bagtly ýaly däldi.
I can't do that to you again	Men muny saňa ýene edip bilemok
Impossible, for them.	Mümkin däl, olar üçin.
He lives here.	Ol şu ýerde ýaşaýar.
I couldn't tell anyone the truth	Hiç kime hakykaty aýdyp bilmedim
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
This can be a couple of things.	Bu birnäçe zat bolup biler.
There will be no big deal anywhere else.	Başga bir ýerde uly mesele bolmaz.
Of course, this is not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däl.
I don't need much.	Maňa kän zat gerek däl.
Man, that's his job.	Adam, onuň işi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Edil şonuň ýaly zat.
I think I'm not really human	Hakykatdanam adam däl öýdýän
I saw it today.	Men şu gün gördüm.
I can't take it anymore	Men muny indi alyp bilemok
We are not against it.	Biz muňa garşy däl.
Good job	Gowy iş.

Now it is completely gone.	Indi düýbünden ýok boldy.

I was very worried.	Men gaty alada etdim.
I'm good to go.	Men gitmek gowy.

He wants to go home.	Öýüne gitmek isleýär.
He said this.	Ol muny aýtdy.
What a happy, happy man.	Nähili bagtly, bagtly adam.
I thought something really was going to happen	Hakykatdanam bir zat bolar öýdüpdim
I must go	Men hökman gitmeli
A few years ago.	Birnäçe ýyl mundan öň.
It will come.	Bu geler.
It will take weeks, months.	Birnäçe hepde, birnäçe aý gerek bolar.
Not just once.	Diňe bir gezek däl.
I did not object.	Men muňa garşy däldim.
That's right.	Dogry.
I know what to do	Näme etmelidigini bilýärin
It seemed so good to me.	Maňa gaty gowy ýalydy.
I knew nothing about him	Men ol hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
This job is great.	Bu iş gaty gowy.
Of course, this can be difficult.	Elbetde, bu kyn bolup biler.
I didn’t want you here, but now you	Men seni bu ýerde islemedim, ýöne indi sen
I highly doubt it will happen now	Indi boljakdygyna gaty şübhelenýärin
I didn’t want to hurt him	Men oňa zyýan bermek islemedim
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, ol etmeli.
I didn't have much to do	Meniň etmeli köp zadym ýokdy
There was something else.	Başga bir zat bardy.
What a bad thing this is.	Bu nähili erbet zat.
It's about everything.	Bu hemme zat hakda.
Too bad.	Gaty erbet.
Ma'am	Bu
What a day!	Nähili gün!
He agreed to do it.	Ol bu işi etmäge razy boldy.
Now he could go to work.	Indi ol işe gidip bilýärdi.
Isn't that beautiful?	Bu owadan dälmi?
You need to know this.	Muny bilmek gerek.
Okay, things go.	Bolýar, zatlar bolýar.
Everyone here is different.	Bu ýerde hemmeler başga.
It really helps.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek edýär.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolmaz.
This will not be the case for us.	Bu biziň üçin beýle bolmaz.
I don't have to tell anyone.	Hiç kime aýtmaly däl.
We can tell.	Biz aýdyp bileris.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, uly kynçylyk.
I was very worried about you	Men sen hakda gaty alada etdim
I'll take care of that.	Men muňa alada ederin.
I have to ask you a question	Size bir sorag bermeli
He was always there for her.	Elmydama onuň üçin bardy.
This is another matter.	Bu başga mesele.
It's good to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy zat.
He did it again.	Ol muny ýene etdi.
He called me again.	Ol maňa ýene jaň etdi.
No one knew, no one wanted to know.	Hiç kim bilmedi, hiç kim bilmek islemedi.
He said he never did such good things for me.	Ol hiç wagt meniň üçin beýle gowy zatlar etmedi diýdi.
I only do this to help you.	Men muny diňe size kömek etmek üçin edýärin.
I do not.	Men ýok.
There are many problems.	Mesele köp.
I can't go there	Men ol ýere baryp bilemok
It was not fun.	Bu gyzykly däldi.
I can only hope it will	Diňe bolar diýip umyt edip bilerin
That's right.	Dogry dogry.
he says	ol aýdýar
He didn't have to do that.	Ol beýle etmeli däldi.
He could not go today.	Ol şu gün gidip bilmedi.
I'll be there or for a while.	Men ol ýerde ýa-da biraz wagt bolaryn.
It should be time.	Wagty bolmaly.
Good job	Gowy iş.
This was not a bad purchase.	Bu erbet satyn almak däldi.
You have to stop this.	Muny bes etmeli.
I think it was good	Bu gowy boldy öýdýän
I couldn't sleep.	Men uklap bilmedim.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
It will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek bolar.
There was no such thing as a full-time job.	Doly iş ýaly zat ýokdy.
This is unlikely to happen.	Munuň beýle bolmagy mümkin däl.
I think everyone is ready to do something new.	Meniň pikirimçe, her kim täze zatlar etmäge taýyn.
I didn't try again	Men ýene synap görmedim
He looked good at the time.	Ol şol wagt gowy ýalydy.
It's fast too.	Bu hem çalt.
He obeyed.	Ol boýun boldy.
I had to do it for myself	Muny özüm üçin etmeli boldum
Oh, there is hope where there is life.	Aý, durmuş bar ýerde umyt bar.
Interesting question.	Gyzykly sorag.
This is also difficult for us.	Bu hem biziň üçin kyn.
He tried to suggest.	Teklip etjek boldy.
There is no one else here.	Bu ýerde başga hiç kim ýok.
I don't think it's right to tell you.	Saňa aýtmak dogry däl öýdýärin.
It will be us.	Bu biz bolar.
There may be a problem	Mesele bolup biler
I can't be crazy	Men däli bolup bilemok
I thought it would be interesting.	Gyzykly bolar öýdüpdim.
They are very good.	Olar gaty gowy.
Now another.	Indi başga.
Today was a very difficult day.	Bu gün gaty kyn gün boldy.
I just have to go	Men diňe gitmeli
These things are not.	Bu zatlar däl.
I don't really know the problem.	Meseläni hakykatdanam bilemok.
It's easier.	Bu has aňsat.

I got you something	Men saňa bir zat aldym
I don't know what happened to him.	Men onuň näme bolandygyny bilemok.
I need you	Maňa senden gerek
And so it is.	Şeýle hem bolýar.
I never liked it	Men muny hiç haçan gowy görmedim
I hope it comes	Geler diýip umyt edýärin
No one could tell him what had happened.	Hiç kim özüne näme bolandygyny aýdyp bilmedi.
Nor is it against it.	Şeýle hem garşy däl.
I have	Mende bar
It's hard for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin kyn.
There was no news.	Hiç haçan habar ýokdy.
I hope it wasn't too much for him	Bu onuň üçin gaty kän däldi diýip umyt edýärin
I'm sure this will happen	Munuň boljakdygyna ynanýaryn
He had never been before.	Ol öňem ýokdy.
He told me once.	Ol maňa bir gezek aýtdy.
To see	Görmek üçin.
I just bought one	Men diňe birini satyn aldym
He wanted to be there.	Ol isledi, şol ýerde.
Now no one spoke.	Indi hiç kim söz aýtmady.
Arrest him.	Ony tussag et.
I am not human	Men adam däl
I can't think of him	Men onuň bilen pikir edip bilemok
I want to do it all again	Hemmesini ýene bir gezek etmek isleýärin
It was new, not so bad.	Täze boldy, beýle erbet däldi.
We can do something about it.	Bu barada bir zat edip bileris.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
Crazy enough to do that.	Muny etmäge ýeterlik däli.
That was not the case.	Bu mesele däldi.
Now there is nothing wrong.	Indi ýalňyşlyk ýok.
You have to do better	Has gowy iş etmeli
Of course, it wasn't very beautiful.	Elbetde, gaty bir owadan däldi.
I can only hope so	Diňe şeýle bolar diýip umyt edip bilerin
Once upon a time.	Bir gezek.
It must be really cool	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp bolmaly
That was the answer.	Bu jogap boldy.
I just want to go	Men diňe gitmek isleýärin
There was no other reason for doing so.	Muny etmegiň başga sebäbi ýokdy.
I believe in him completely	Men oňa doly ynanýaryn
Something else, something else.	Başga bir zat, başga bir zat.
I fired him	Men ony işden aldym
You have to do something.	Bir zatlar etmeli.
I had to go	Men gitmeli boldum
He will need help tomorrow.	Ertir oňa kömek gerek bolar.
There will be more tomorrow.	Ertir özi has köp bolar.
This is not possible at all.	Bu düýbünden mümkin däl.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Kynçylyk gaty köp.
I didn't mean to offend you	Men sizi biynjalyk etmek islemedim
I have a lot of money	Mende köp pul bar
I think so.	Men pikir edýärin.
It could be worse.	Bu has erbet bolup biler.
You don't have to say or do anything.	Hiç zat aýtmak ýa-da etmek hökman däl.
He is with them now.	Ol häzir olar bilen.
That's great news.	Ol uly habar.
Maybe not much.	Belki kän bolmaz.
It really came to me	Bu hakykatdanam maňa geldi
Every word	Her söz.
It was a must.	Hökman boldy.
I don't want to say anything that could hurt you.	Size zyýan berip biljek bir zat aýtmak islämok.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
He left again.	Ol ýene gitdi.
I think he did a great job	Ajaýyp bir iş etdi diýip pikir edýärin
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hökman däldi
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle däl.
I did, but not now	Men etdim, ýöne indi däl
There was already one of you today	Şu gün eýýäm senden biri bardy
What a word.	Näme söz.
It's over now.	Indi boldy.
He can help you.	Ol size kömek edip biler.
I can't really get it	Men ony hakykatdanam alyp bilemok
','.	','.
It just seemed so interesting.	Edil gyzykly bir zat ýalydy.
I'll just be fine	Men diňe gowy bolaryn
It's easy to do that.	Muny etmek aňsat.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
There are two possible reasons for this.	Munuň iki ähtimal sebäbi bar.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat däldi.
He was already there.	Ol öňem bardy.
I gave it to him.	Men oňa berdim.
I think that would be a good idea	Bu gowy pikir bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I told you so much	Men saňa gaty köp zat aýtdym
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
It was the worst.	Bu iň erbet boldy.
Always	Hemişe.
I did that last year.	Men muny geçen ýyl etdim.
I don't know what is bad.	Erbet zat bilemok.
All right, he said.	Bolýar, diýdi.
Now never.	Indi hiç haçan.
I told you a lot	Men saňa köp zat aýtdym
I have to tell him	Men oňa aýtmaly
There seemed to be no problem.	Mesele ýok ýalydy.
I think that's what he wants.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu onuň isleýän zady.
Because that's not the case.	Sebäbi bu beýle däl.
I took it and answered	Men ony alyp, jogap berdim
I didn't want to go there	Men ol ýere gitmek islemedim
Everyone did something.	Her kim bir zatlar etdi.
Good job, man.	Gowy iş, adam.
I didn't mind that much	Men muňa kän bir garşy däldim
It was a lot of fun.	Gaty hezil boldy.
Of course I can tell	Elbetde, aýdyp bilerin
At that time.	Şol wagt.
It's three o'clock in the morning.	Indi irden üç boldy.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
I never knew it would be so good	Munuň şeýle gowy bolup biljekdigini hiç wagt bilmeýärdim
I want it all for myself, and he got it	Hemmesini özüm üçin isleýärin, ol hem aldy
I found this strange	Munuň geň däldigini gördüm
It will be one of two things.	Iki zadyň biri bolar.
It was fun.	Bu gyzykly boldy.
I never thought about it	Men bu hakda hiç wagt pikir etmedim
I'm not alone yet.	Men entek özüm ýok.
Maybe as good as you	Belki seniň ýaly gowy.
I thought it turned out really well	Bu hakykatdanam gowy çykdy diýip pikir etdim
I could only do so much right now	Men edil şu wagt diňe köp zat edip bilýärdim
I've given it to you before	Men muny öňem berdim
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şonuň ýaly boldy.
You are young	Sen ýaş.
There is no problem here.	Bu ýerde hiç hili mesele ýok.
I don't know anything	Men asla hiç zady bilemok
He told me.	Ol maňa aýtdy.
I saw you	Men seni gördüm
I didn't want to talk about it	Bu hakda gürleşmek islemedim
They are not very good.	Olar gaty gowy däl.
He wondered if there was anything else to it. 	Munuň üçin başga bir zat barmy diýip pikir etdi. 
This is really strange.	Bu hakykatdanam geň zat.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
He was like another man.	Ol başga adam ýalydy.
How it should be.	Bu nähili bolmaly.
It's too bad.	Ol gaty erbet.
I am very short.	Men gaty gysga.
You have to be ready next time	Indiki gezek taýyn bolmaly
I want to be like him.	Men onuň ýaly bolmak isleýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
I couldn't say no to him	Men oňa "ýok" diýip bilmedim
I'm a really good guy	Men hakykatdanam gaty gowy ýigit
He said it would only take one year.	Ol munuň diňe bir ýyl boljakdygyny aýtdy.
No problem, life happens.	Mesele ýok, durmuş bolýar.
He could not sleep.	Ol uklap bilmedi.
I'm here if you need anything.	Bir zat gerek bolsa men şu ýerde.
I don't know anymore	Men indi bilemok
Time.	Wagt.
I'm so scared of that.	Men muňa gaty gorkýaryn.
In short.	Gysga.
More	Has köp.
He has not yet responded.	Ol henizem jogap bermedi.
I want you and only you	Men seni we diňe seni isleýärin
This is not very good.	Bu gaty gowy däl.
You need it again	Size ýene bir gezek gerek
I knew about these things	Men bu zatlar hakda bilýärdim
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu dogry däl.
And then he said something else.	Soň bolsa başga bir zat aýtdy.
Many	Köp.
I know something good	Men gowy zady bilýärin
This is nothing for me.	Bu meniň üçin hiç zat däl.
Maybe someone else.	Belki başga biri.
What he can do, maybe, will help.	Onuň edip biljek zady, belki kömek eder.
I knew this was not true	Munuň hakykatdanam däldigini bilýärdim
He understood.	Oňa düşündi.
This can be bad for the job.	Bu iş üçin erbet bolup biler.
There was something else he wanted to do.	Başga bir isleýän zady bardy.
It may take weeks, months.	Birnäçe hepde, aý gerek bolup biler.
It could be good !.	Gowy bolup biler!.
This can take a long time.	Bu gaty köp wagt alyp biler.
I think it will be something every year	Meniň pikirimçe, bu her ýyl bir zat bolar
I got an easier question	Has aňsat sorag aldym
No one paid attention to me.	Hiç kim maňa üns bermedi.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
So is everyone.	Hemmeler hem şeýle.
Maybe one day it will.	Belki, bu bir gün bolar.
He doesn't know what to do.	Ol näme edýändigini bilenok.
No one.	Hiç kim ýok.
I don't know anything at all	Men düýbünden hiç zady bilemok
I care a lot	Men köp zat hakda alada edýärin
I saw it myself	Muny özüm gördüm
I have this message for him	Mende onuň üçin bu habar bar
Ol.	Ol.
Saying something else is completely false.	Başga bir zat aýtmak düýbünden ýalan.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
Isn't that the right way to go? 	Bu, dogry ýol dälmi?
.	.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I can do something else.	Başga bir zat edip bilýärin.
Help quickly	Çalt kömek et
She is also happy.	Şeýle hem ol bagtly.
So it could be something.	Şonuň üçin bu bir zat bolup biler.
You know, I'm still worried about you	Bilýärsiň, men henizem sen hakda alada edýärin
At that moment, he decided to go home.	Şol wagt öýüne gitmek kararyna geldi.
He answered you.	Ol saňa jogap berdi.
It will come in a different way.	Başga ýol bilen geler.
Not just a request.	Diňe haýyş däl.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
The work was necessary for me.	Iş meniň üçin zerur boldy.
I thought it was good.	Gowy diýip pikir etdim.
He wanted me here.	Ol meni şu ýerde isledi.
I never cared about you	Men hiç wagt sen hakda alada etmedim
It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Money made things possible.	Pul zatlary mümkin etdi.
I can't love it	Men ony gowy görüp bilemok
I want this for myself	Muny özüm üçin isleýärin
I don't want to talk about the problem.	Kynçylyk hakda gürleşmek islämok.
Must do.	Etmeli.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
You are not.	Siz beýle däl.
Indeed, it is.	Hakykatdanam, şeýle.
This is really difficult.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn.
I think this makes me stupid	Bu meni samsyk edýär öýdýän
It wasn’t easy or fun.	Bu aňsat ýa-da gyzykly däldi.
Just weird.	Diňe geň.
Nothing more.	Mundan başga hiç zat ýok.
impossible.	mümkin däl.
Then he returned to work.	Soň bolsa işe gaýdyp geldi.
I want to know	Men bilmek isleýärin
He would have been happy before.	Ol öňem bagtly bolardy.
I was there for a year	Men ol ýerde bir ýyl boldum
We are stupid, but.	Biz samsyk, ýöne.
I can't rest	Men dynç alyp bilemok
Everything seemed good here.	Bu ýerde hemme zat gowy ýalydy.
That can't even be true.	Bu hatda dogry hem bolup bilmez.
Today is life.	Bu gün şu, durmuş.
I thought it was very beautiful	Gaty owadan diýip pikir etdim
You have to do this several times	Muny birnäçe gezek etmeli
This is very close to you.	Bu siziň üçin gaty ýakyn.
Of course I helped	Elbetde kömek etdim
I believe this could be something else	Munuň başga bir zat bolup biljekdigine ynanýaryn
Now there is one.	Indi biri bar.
I have seen him several times	Men ony birnäçe gezek gördüm
I am not	Men beýle däl
I gave it to him	Men muny berdim
They weren't like you.	Olar seniň ýaly däldi.
One hour and I'm sorry.	Bir sagat we bagyşlaň.
I really want to help	Men hakykatdanam kömek etmek isleýärin
She had to do it.	Oňa muny etmeli boldy.
I have to give you everything	Men saňa hemme zady bermeli
Not much.	Kän däldi.
So do another one, another one, another one.	Şonuň üçin ýene birini, ýene birini, ýene birini et.
I will not be the only adult there	Men ol ýerde ýekeje uly adam bolmaz
I think we can do that	Muny edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin
This is not a smart thing to do.	Bu akylly zat däl.
I could not answer him	Men oňa jogap berip bilmedim
Still close at the time.	Şol wagt henizem ýakyn.
I rested for a few days	Birnäçe gün dynç aldym
I couldn't do it here	Men bu ýerde edip bilmedim
Of course, there was no reason for that.	Elbetde, munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýokdy.
This is a big deal.	Bu uly mesele.
Of course, something different with us.	Elbetde, biziň bilen başga zat.
It really is.	Hakykatdanam şeýle.
We are there.	Biz şol ýerde.
This is a really good question.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy sorag.
Easy for me.	Meniň üçin aňsat.
This is not difficult.	Bu kyn däl.
So it is easier for me.	Şonuň üçin bu meniň üçin has aňsat.
How true is it today?	Bu gün nädip dogry?
I don't have anything.	Maňa hiç zat gelenok.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
It really does exist.	Hakykatdanam bar.
I didn't see anyone	Men hiç kimi görmedim
I saw him do that.	Men onuň muny edýändigini gördüm.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
Maybe never.	Belki hiç haçan bolmaz.
Is there help?	Ol ýerde kömek barmy?
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
This is often true.	Bu köplenç dogry.
It's been two weekends	Iki dynç güni boldy
I've heard it a lot	Men muny gaty köp eşitdim
And then he couldn't sleep again.	Soň bolsa ýene uklap bilmedi.
Enough is enough.	Elbetde ýeterlik.
Until then.	Oňa çenli.
I need everything	Maňa hemme zat gerek
A good word kept him busy.	Gowy söz ony meşgul etdi.
Of course, he was not there to see me.	Elbetde, ol meni görmek üçin ýokdy.
I know something happened to him	Onuň bilen bir zadyň bolandygyny bilýärin
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
You can too.	Siz hem edip bilersiňiz.
You have to do something.	Bir zatlar etmeli.
I will help.	Men kömek etjek.
I don't need anything right now.	Maňa şu wagt zat gerek däl.
Life is not like that.	Durmuş beýle däl.
It was great.	Gaty gowy boldy.
Always about me and just about me.	Elmydama men we diňe men hakda.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şeýle zat.
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolar.
I can give it to myself	Muny özüm berip bilerin
Not as before.	Öňküsi ýaly däl.
I thought it would be fun	Munuň gyzykly boljakdygyny pikir etdim
We have one and two.	Biz bir we iki ýaly bar.
I can tell you about it one day	Bu hakda bir gün size aýdyp bilerin
I was never beautiful	Men asla owadan däldim
It was a lot of fun for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty gyzykly boldy.
And then there was everyone else.	Soň bolsa başga hemmeler bardy.
Don't go for less that your full potential.	Uzak gitmeli däl.
I'm a little sorry for him.	Men oňa birneme gynanýaryn.
There is only one thing here	Diňe şu ýerde bir zadym bar
There were those things.	Ol zatlar bardy.
You are new here	Siz bu ýerde täze
I only heard one voice	Men diňe bir ses eşitdim
I tried again.	Men ýene synap gördüm.
The last two weeks have been with me.	Soňky iki hepde meniň bilen boldy.
He never had to go.	Ol hiç haçan gitmeli däldi.
Well, I do.	Gowy, men.
He was well aware of this.	Ol muny gowy bilýärdi.
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle bolmaz
Nothing now.	Häzir hiç zat ýok.
Early and often.	Ir we köplenç.
I saw what happened to him.	Men oňa näme bolandygyny gördüm.
Of course, there is a problem.	Elbetde, bir mesele bar.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
I only heard the sound once	Men diňe bir gezek ses eşitdim
I knew something had happened	Bir zadyň bolandygyny bilýärdim
That was not the case at the time.	Şol wagt bu dogry däldi.
I can't be together every day and all night	Her gün we bütin gije bile bolup bilemok
So it should be good there.	Şonuň üçin ol ýerde gowy bolmaly.
This is for us.	Biziň üçin bu.
No one.	Hiç kim ýok.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
Who is he	Ol kim?
This is smart.	Bu akylly.
I will not be here anymore	Men mundan beýläk bolmaz
I need something for	Maňa bir zat gerek
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Edil şonuň ýaly kömek gerek.
I thought so.	Beýle bolar öýdüpdim.
I know this well.	Men muny gowy bilýärin.
He went there.	Ol şol ýere gitdi.
Not the last.	Soňky däl.
This is another.	Bu başga biri.
Because	Sebäbi.
Maybe there is.	Belki bar bolmagy mümkin.
Everything is an opportunity.	Hemme zat bir mümkinçilik.
I was happy again	Men ýene bagtly boldum
I will be here for you	Men bu ýerde siziň üçin bolaryn
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
This will not happen.	Bu bolmaz.
Maybe I'm doing the same thing	Mümkin, edil şonuň ýaly zady edýärin
He wanted to be like that.	Ol şeýle bolmak isledi.
I think he's a bad person	Meniň pikirimçe, ol erbet adam
I heard that yesterday	Düýn şeýle eşitdim
I think that's weird.	Meniň pikirimçe bu geň.
He knows the truth.	Ol hakykaty bilýär.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I don't have to be stupid	Men samsyk bolmaly däl
I thought it would be easier.	Has aňsat bolar öýdüpdim.
This is work.	Bu iş.
This cannot be life.	Bu durmuş bolup bilmez.
I gave him something	Men oňa bir zat berdim
We need it.	Ol bize gerek.
This is not a request.	Bu haýyş däl.
I never thought about it	Men bu barada hiç wagt pikir etmedim
If you have to, you have to go.	Bolmaly bolsa gitmeli.
I didn't do it that morning	Men ol gün irden etmedim
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I actually feel sorry for him.	Aslynda oňa gynanýaryn.
Not at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda däl.
I thought it was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy diýip pikir etdim.
No one did that.	Muny hiç kim etmedi.
I just need time.	Maňa diňe wagt gerek.
I thought he knew	Ol bilýärmi diýip pikir etdim
Really much.	Hakykatdanam köp.
Two more things are enough here	Bu ýerde ýene iki zat ýeterlik
Everyone, every age.	Her bir adam, her ýaş.
He said he did.	Ol şeýle etdi diýdi.
It won't be beautiful.	Bu owadan bolmaz.
Maybe for us.	Belki biziň üçin.
I think that's the right question.	Bu dogry sorag diýip pikir edýärin.
I really don't think so.	Men hakykatdanam ony beýle pikir etmeýärin.
These are just two.	Bu diňe ikisi.
Tell us about it.	Bu hakda bize aýdyň.
I'll call again later.	Soň ýene jaň ederin.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
He never said.	Ol hiç haçan aýtmady.
I'm not full anymore	Men indi doly däl
This is a great opportunity.	Bu uly mümkinçilik.
Seriously.	Çynlakaý.
There is nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýok.
I got one here	Men şu ýerde birini aldym
I agree.	Men razy boldum.
I don't think that can be helped	Meniň pikirimçe, bu kömek bolup bilmez
This is what happens.	Bu şeýle bolýar.
Seems like he can never do the right thing	Hiç haçan dogry bir zat edip bilmeýän ýaly
I must have done more	Men has köp zat eden bolmaly
I am a young man.	Men, ýigit.
It doesn't seem to bother him.	Bu ony biynjalyk eden ýaly däl.
I want one.	Men birini isleýän.
He had so much fun doing it.	Muny etmek bilen gaty hezil etdi.
Everything will be fine now.	Häzir hemme zat bolar.
Of course, he didn't think about it.	Elbetde, ol bu barada hiç zat pikir etmedi.
I hope you don't mind	Muňa garşy däl diýip umyt edýärin
I really can't say.	Men hakykatdanam aýdyp biljek däl.
I'm not with you	Men seniň bilen däl
I don’t want to be like that anymore.	Mundan beýläk beýle bolmak islämok.
I can't say what he can do.	Näme edip biljekdigini aýdyp biljek däl.
I haven't seen it before.	Men ozal görmedim.
He went home.	Öýüne gitdi.
You can't really worry about that.	Bu barada hakykatdanam alada edip bolmaz.
Big, big.	Uly, uly.
OK, except me.	Bolýar, menden başga.
This was not possible	Bu mümkin däldi
I couldn't do that anymore	Men muny indi edip bilmedim
I must have called	Men jaň eden bolmaly
I had a hard day there	Men ol ýerde bir gün kyn boldum
Time is short.	Wagt gysga.
He just wants to go to school	Ol diňe mekdebe gitmek isleýär
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
It was nothing.	Ol bir zat däldi.
It was a good life.	Gowy durmuş boldy.
I think he was late	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gijä galdy
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Munuň üçin has köp zadyň bardygyny bilýän bolmaly.
This is also not possible.	Bu hem mümkin däl.
I can't see it	Men ony görüp bilemok
Because he came back to her.	Sebäbi oňa gaýdyp geldi.
I received a strange call this morning	Şu gün irden maňa geň jaň geldi
I didn't really think so	Aslynda beýle pikir etmedim
He said OK.	Bolýar diýdi.
I'm not sure he'll do that	Onuň muny etjekdigine ynanamok
I think he really cares about me	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hakykatdanam meni alada edýär
He has to go.	Ol gitmeli.
I make everything possible	Men hemme zady mümkin edýärin
That was it.	Bu boldy.
We need work.	Bize iş gerek.
That's it.	Boldy et.
No other sound.	Başga ses ýok.
And he wants to make you happy.	We sizi bagtly etmek isleýär.
It was fun.	Gyzykly boldy.
I do this for you.	Men muny siziň üçin edýärin.
I thought it was a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir etdim.
I have great news	Mende ajaýyp habar bar
So that's it.	Şonuň üçin bu şeýle.
This time it is still visible.	Bu gezek henizem görünýär.
You have to do this again.	Muny ýene bir gezek etmeli.
I could do nothing	Men hiç zat edip bilmedim
A man like me.	Meniň ýaly adam.
I will be better.	Men has gowy bolaryn.
That's it.	Ine, şeýle.
Not really.	Aslynda dogry däl.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
He is in a happy place.	Ol bagtly ýerde.
He knows nothing better.	Ol mundan gowy zat bilmeýär.
I can't be a bad person for him anymore.	Indi onuň üçin erbet adam bolup bilemok.
I still have that book.	Mende henizem şol kitap bar.
I can get it	Men ony alyp bilerin
He did nothing else.	Mundan başga hiç zat etmedi.
She wants to help.	Kömek etmek isleýär.
I had to do that	Muny etmeli boldum
That can't be a good thing.	Bu gowy zat bolup bilmez.
He understood now.	Ol indi düşündi.
I believe that	Men muňa ynanýaryn
I haven't seen anyone else	Başga birini görmedim
Where is he	Ol nirede?
It's hard to decide.	Karar bermek kyn.
There are several reasons.	Birnäçe sebäp bar.
That's how I responded	Men oňa şeýle jogap berdim
Of course he knew that.	Elbetde, muny bilýärdi.
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolar.
Because it's not you.	Sebäbi sen däl bir zat.
In fact, no one bothered me.	Hakykatdanam, meni hiç kim biynjalyk etmedi.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
Here is the problem.	Ine, mesele.

He didn't want to either.	Şeýle hem islemedi.
It was great to do that.	Muny etmek gaty gowy boldy.

I think that's a good thing	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
I still don't know what to do	Entek näme etmelidigimi bilmedim
What happened 	Näme boldy?
he thought.	diýip pikir etdi.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
I have to go with you	Men seniň bilen gitmeli
I saw him again.	Men ony ýene gördüm.
I just didn’t have much hope that it would happen.	Diňe onuň boljakdygyna kän bir umyt etmedim.
The problem is you.	Mesele sen.
I saw it immediately	Men derrew ony gördüm
I think a lot of people are	Meniň pikirimçe, köp adam şeýle
You can do this yourself.	Muny özüňiz edip bilersiňiz.
I just thought about it, it happened	Men bu hakda diňe pikir etdim, şeýle boldy
It was not something he knew very well.	Onuň gaty gowy bilýän zady däldi.
This is unlikely to happen.	Munuň beýle bolmagy mümkin däl.
She was worried.	Ol özüni biynjalyk etdi.
I did not have.	Mende ýokdy.
I didn't know that.	Men muny bilmeýärdim.
You have to do something.	Bir zat etmeli.
He is close to you now.	Ol häzir saňa ýakyn.
I think you'll be fine here	Bu ýerde gowy bolarsyňyz öýdýän
It wasn't bad.	Erbet däldi.
I think we can still help him	Oňa henizem kömek edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin
I can't say anymore.	Indi aýdyp biljek däl.
I didn't think much of it	Men oňa kän pikir etmedim
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele.
I don’t have to do this all day.	Men muny bütin gün etmeli däl.
I can rest for tomorrow	Ertir üçin dynç alyp bilerin
Good.	Gowy.
There was no such thing here.	Bu ýerde beýle zat ýokdy.
The time was short.	Wagt gysga boldy.
And that's fine with this.	Munuň üçin bolsa gowy.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
I call once	Bir gezek jaň edýärin
Of course something was wrong.	Elbetde bir zat dogry däldi.
He thinks no.	Ol ýok diýip pikir edýär.
Of course	Elbetde
I don't want to be	Bolmak islämok.
A lot can happen	Köp zat bolup biler
Bad song.	Erbet aýdym.
I don't think so	Meni halamaýar öýdýärin
Oh, that guy.	Aý, ol ýigit.
This is not a good thing.	Bu gowy iş däl.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
She is a beautiful person.	Ol owadan adam.
He seemed very close to her.	Oňa gaty ýakyn ýalydy.
I am very good.	Men gaty gowy.
Another time.	Başga wagt.
Like this	Bu ýaly.
I was worried about you.	Men sen hakda alada etdim.
Someone do that.	Biri muny et.
That's what happened tonight.	Bu gije şeýle boldy.
It could be a very close call!	Bu gaty ýakyn jaň bolup biler!
He never said much.	Ol hiç wagt kän zat aýtmady.
I don't agree with you anymore	Men indi senden razy däl
That's all there is to it.	Diňe şu, başga hiç zat ýok.
Why worry?	Näme üçin alada etmeli?
It was a great day.	Bu ajaýyp gün boldy.
Last year was a wonderful day	Geçen ýyl ajaýyp gün
I really couldn't get that	Men hakykatdanam beýle zady alyp bilmedim
Everyone should give me more time.	Her kim maňa has köp wagt bermeli.
He must have known better than to worry	Alada etmekden has gowy bilýän bolmaly
This is our first.	Bu biziň ilkinji.
I can do everything right	Men hemme zady dogry edip bilerin
I was not good at it	Men munuň üçin gowy däldim
He knew he wanted more.	Ol has köp zady isleýändigini bilýärdi.
There is no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýok.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
There was no job for a man like him.	Onuň ýaly adam üçin iş ýokdy.
Good.	Gowy.
He knew he couldn't sleep.	Ol uklap bilmejekdigini bilýärdi.
I think it needs to be clear	Munuň aýdyň bolmagy zerur diýip pikir edýärin
That could be the case.	Bu hem şeýle bolup biler.
I can tell you that something is wrong	Bir zadyň dogry däldigini aýdyp bilerin
I hoped it would be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt etdim.
This is a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý mesele.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
Of course he wanted to.	Elbetde, isledi.
He knew he could do it.	Edip biljekdigini bilýärdi.
Something could happen to him.	Oňa bir zat bolup biler.
I didn’t care enough	Men ýeterlik alada etmedim
He wants to know.	Ol bilmek isleýär.
Good day	Gowy gün.
I think everything is fine	Hemme zat ajaýyp diýip pikir edýärin
I arrested him.	Men ony tussag etdim.
They are not smart.	Olar akylly däl.
They are instantly beautiful.	Olar derrew ajaýyp.
I was no one.	Men hiç kim däldim.
There is a big clock.	Uly sagat bar.
It's easy. "	Bu aňsat "diýdi.
And then he did.	Soň bolsa etdi.
Good, good.	Gowy, gowy.
I have to go now	Men indi gitmeli
I can take care of myself.	Men özüm hakda alada edip bilerin.
I did not see bad	Erbet görmedim
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
How was that?	Bu nähili boldy.
That's it.	Ine, şeýle.
Long week	Uzak hepde.
I care a lot about you	Men sen hakda köp alada edýärin
That must be something.	Bu bir zat bolmaly.
I have had it for several years.	Mende birnäçe ýyl bäri bar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there. "	Iň zerur "-diýdi.
I didn't know it at the time	Men şol wagt muny bilmeýärdim
The same reason.	Şol bir sebäp.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
I couldn't be there	Men ol ýerde bolup bilmedim
You are a good boy	Sen gowy ýigit
Of course nothing new.	Elbetde täze zat ýok.
This is us.	Bu biz.
I said that.	Men muny aýtdym.
Nothing last.	Soňky hiç zat ýok.
We are not far away.	Biz uzak däl.
He is not such a person.	Ol beýle adam däl.
So there is no reason.	Şonuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
I didn't have to do that	Men muny etmeli däldim
I am no one	Men hiç kim däl
I could be worse	Men has erbet bolup bilerin
There may be several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bolup biler.
I think that's a good idea	Bu gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin
Even the last.	Hatda iň soňky.
I had a few, and now the sun is up	Mende birnäçe bardy, indi gün çykdy
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
I can give you a good time	Men size gowy wagt berip bilerin
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
Maybe there was already.	Belki, eýýäm bardy.
Like him	Ol ýaly.
Oh, one more thing.	Aý, ýene bir zat.
Wonderful evening there.	Ol ýerde ajaýyp agşam.
Now this is something.	Indi bu bir zat.
Another time.	Başga wagt.
This did not happen to them.	Bu olar bilen bolup bilmedi.
I don't think so now.	Häzir beýle däl öýdemok.
I hope this helps you.	Bu size kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
In fact, I don't want to talk about it	Aslynda bu hakda gürleşmek islämok
He really is.	Ol hakykatdanam.
It was the last.	Iň soňky boldy.
He is right.	Ol bu barada dogry aýdýar.
This is not an option.	Bu mümkinçilik däl.
I am here.	Men şu ýerde.
I really don't agree.	Men hakykatdanam razy däl.
I think that's it.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu bar.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
Both must agree.	Ikisi-de razy bolmaly.
We shouldn't be, but that's the way it is.	Biz bolmaly däl, ýöne şeýle.
There was only one word for that.	Munuň üçin ýeke-täk söz bardy.
I never thought about it, maybe	Men bu barada hiç haçan pikir etmedim, belki
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
I called you once	Men saňa bir gezek jaň etdim
It's really nice to see you.	Seni görmek hakykatdanam gowy zat.
It took a while.	Biraz wagt gerek boldy.
I always think of myself	Özümi hemişe pikir edýärin
That's right.	Bu dogry.
I haven't done it yet, not at all	Men henizem etmedim, düýbünden däl
Ma'am.	Bu.
The clock could not do anything.	Sagat hiç zat edip bilmedi.
I just know it's not the right time	Diňe munuň dogry wagt däldigini bilýärin
No one helped to do that.	Muny etmäge hiç kim kömek etmedi.
I did and I got it	Men etdim we aldym
I could no longer be that person	Men indi ol adam bolup bilmedim
He already understood that.	Ol munuň özi üçin eýýäm düşündi.
Definitely a difficult issue.	Elbetde kyn mesele.
There was still something for him.	Onuň üçin henizem bir zat bardy.
I'm not alone anymore	Men indi diňe özüm däl
That's all there was to it.	Diňe şu bardy.
I just didn’t want to	Men diňe islemedim
I hope someone knows what to do	Biri näme etmelidigini bilýär diýip umyt edýärin
It was not an interesting night for me.	Bu meniň üçin gyzykly gije däldi.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
I bought it myself	Men muny özüm satyn aldym
I couldn't take it anymore	Indi alyp bilmedim
I know.	Men bilýärin.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
Here it is.	Ine, biri.
A few weeks later.	Birnäçe hepde soň.
I saw what he wanted.	Men onuň isleýän zadyny gördüm.
I couldn't be stupid	Men samsyk bolup bilmedim
He can't think of anything else.	Başga hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilmez.
I didn't know if he was there or not	Onuň bardygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny bilmedim
It doesn't take much to be happy.	Bagtly bolmak üçin kän zat gerek däl.
I believe in him.	Men oňa ynanýaryn.
You can help me.	Maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz.
I even told him a lot.	Men oňa hatda köp zat aýtdym.
Maybe someone is there.	Belki, ol ýerde kimdir biri bar bolsa gerek.
I do nothing	Men hiç zat etmeýärin
This is a completely different matter.	Bu düýbünden başga mesele.
It was fast.	Bu çalt boldy.
He thinks about you a lot.	Ol sizi köp pikir edýär.
That would be a huge problem.	Bu gaty uly mesele bolar.
I am single now.	Men häzirki wagtda ýeke.
I didn't have to say much	Men beýle köp zat aýtmaly däldim
Do good	Gowy iş et.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu düýbünden dogry däl.
He can take it somewhere.	Ony bir ýere alyp biler.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, şeýle bolar.
That would be nice enough.	Bu ýeterlik gowy bolardy.
This will not happen.	Bu bolmaz.
He understood her.	Ol oňa düşündi.
There will be more.	Has köp zat bolar.
This is probably not the case.	Bu beýle däl bolsa gerek.
One thing for sure.	Elbetde, bir zat.
It would be great	Ajaýyp bolardy
He knew nothing about them.	Ol olar hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdi.
Now I know what to do.	Indi näme etmelidigimi bilýärin.
In fact, I did not object	Aslynda men muňa garşy däldim
Okay, it helps.	Bolýar, kömek edýär.
I can't see it yet	Men ony entek görüp bilemok
Almost, but not at all.	Diýen ýaly, ýöne düýbünden däl.
It's close.	Bu ýakyn.
I was not there enough.	Men ol ýerde ýeterlik däldim.
That's what he wants.	Bu onuň isleýän zady.
For.	Üçin.
I couldn't do that to him	Men oňa muny edip bilmedim
Not so.	Şeýle hem däl.
I even want it, this is the first one for me	Hatda muny isleýärin, bu meniň üçin ilkinji
He did so.	Şeýle etdi.
You can only make one decision.	Diňe bir karar alyp bilersiňiz.
There is nothing against it.	Oňa garşy hiç zat ýok.
It is absolutely beautiful and beautiful.	Bu düýbünden owadan we ajaýyp.
He said this.	Ol muny aýtdy.
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
Man, that's great.	Adam, bu gaty gowy.
I couldn't make another decision	Men başga karar berip bilmedim
This is bad.	Bu erbet.
In fact, they are one.	Aslynda olar bir.
That makes us great.	Bu bizi ajaýyp edýär.
I couldn't be happier for them	Çynlakaý olar üçin has bagtly bolup bilmedim
Okay.	Bolýar.
There is something for everyone here.	Bu ýerde hemmeler üçin bir zat bar.
There will be money somewhere.	Bir ýerde pul bolar.
I think there is something else	Meniň pikirimçe, başga bir zat bar
Now there is something else.	Indi başga zat bar.
Not possible.	Mümkinçilik däl.
And then he took us.	Soň bolsa bizi alyp gitdi.
I didn’t want to hurt him	Men oňa zyýan bermek islemedim
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
Several times, even.	Birnäçe gezek, hatda.
Maybe this will help	Belki bu kömek eder
No one said much.	Hiç kim kän zat aýtmady.
I know it shouldn't be, but it was	Bolmaly däldigini bilýärin, ýöne şeýle boldy
He immediately called me.	Ol derrew maňa jaň etdi.
This is very likely to be true.	Munuň dogry bolmagy gaty ähtimal.
This morning the police called me	Şu gün irden polisiýa maňa jaň etdi
I think that's a good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
That will never happen.	Hiç wagt beýle bolmaz.
What will happen now.	Indi näme bolar.
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
There is nothing wrong with that anymore.	Munuň üçin indi hiç zat ýok.
For you	Seniň üçin
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty ajaýyp.
It's time.	Wagty geldi.
That's it.	Edil şu.
Because it is.	Sebäbi şeýle.
I asked a few questions	Birnäçe sorag berdim
I thought it was too young	Bu gaty ýaş diýip pikir etdim
It doesn't have to be one or the other.	Bir ýa-da başga bir bolmaly däl.
It's really easy.	Bu hakykatdanam aňsat.
I loved it	Men muny gaty gowy gördüm
In fact, I did not object	Aslynda muňa garşy däldim
Now it may be gone.	Häzir ol ýok bolup biler.
I will always be here	Men hemişe şu ýerde bolaryn
I will do the same this year.	Bu ýyl hem edil şonuň ýaly ederin.
You have to be there for that	Munuň üçin şol ýerde bolmaly
I'm sorry, I needed a bit	Bagyşlaň, maňa birneme gerek boldy
I have to go and be ready	Men gitmeli we taýyn bolmaly
I think it's a great thing to think about.	Bu hakda pikir etmek gaty gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
Maximum years or two years	Iň köp ýyl ýa-da iki ýyl
I didn't really think so	Aslynda beýle pikir etmedim
There are two possible reasons for this.	Belki, munuň iki sebäbi bar.
I thought it was just one night	Diňe bir gije boldy öýdüpdim
I can't see anything here	Men bu ýerde hiç zady görüp bilemok
It looks great.	Ajaýyp ýaly görünýär.
I often think about it	Men bu hakda köplenç pikir edýärin
It was not his business.	Bu onuň işi däldi.
I have to help her.	Men oňa kömek etmeli.
I didn't have to say that.	Men muny aýtmaly däldim.
He is not here either.	Ol hem şu ýerde däl.
This is not the last time I have done this	Men muny soňky gezek etmedim
There was food everywhere.	Hemme ýerde nahar bardy.
I thought about the sun	Men gün hakda pikir etdim
I have no choice	Mende başga ýol ýok
This made the job quick and easy.	Bu işi çalt we aňsat etdi.
They seemed full of people to me.	Olar meniň üçin doly adam ýalydy.
I really had to rest	Men hakykatdanam dynç almaly boldum
It's easy to get fired.	Işden gitmek aňsat.
No more.	Indi ýok.
It was completely gone yesterday	Düýn düýbünden ýokdy
I don't know anything about them	Men olar hakda hiç zat bilemok
He did not allow me.	Ol maňa rugsat bermedi.
He is coming.	Ol gelýär.
I have enough	Mende ýeterlik zat bar
Not beautiful.	Owadan däl.
I tried something	Men bir zady synap gördüm
How wonderful would that be?	Bu nähili ajaýyp bolardy?
I couldn't speak anymore	Men indi gürläp bilmedim
It should be the same.	Şeýle hem bolmaly.
He was good to us.	Ol bize gowy boldy.
He doesn't like me either.	Ol hem meni halamaýar.
Long time no see	Uzak wagt
I didn't want to talk about it	Men bu hakda gürleşmek islemedim
I didn't want to do that	Şeýle etmek islemedim
It doesn't matter to him.	Bu onuň üçin hiç hili alada däl.
I thought something might happen to you.	Saňa bir zat bolup biler öýdüpdim.
I don't know how	Nädip bilemok
I told her calm down and we would take care of her.	Men oňa zyýan bermeli däldigini aýtdym.
It's interesting to me.	Meniň üçin gyzykly zat.
I just saw it.	Men diňe bir gördüm.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ol hakda ýalan zat ýok.
This was not the only reason.	Munuň ýeke-täk sebäbi däldi.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
What's the matter?	Mesele näme?
I told her I was OK	Men oňa hiç haçan garşy däldigini aýtdym
This did not help.	Bu kömek etmedi.
There are several possibilities here.	Bu ýerde birnäçe mümkinçilik bar.
Then one left.	Soň bolsa biri galdy.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I still think this is true.	Bu henizem dogry diýip pikir edýärin.
I can't tell you everything	Men saňa hemme zady aýdyp biljek däl
I did not	Men etmedim
Not a very good thing.	Gaty gowy zat däl.
As before.	Öňküsi ýaly.
I had to do something else	Başga bir zat etmeli boldum
It cannot be seen anywhere.	Ony hiç ýerde görüp bolmaz.
It sounded like advice to me.	Bu meniň üçin maslahat ýalydy.
It seemed interesting there.	Ol ýerde gyzykly ýalydy.
I think that's the idea	Meniň pikirimçe, bu pikir
This is often the case.	Bu hatda köplenç gowy boldy.
Maybe I need more time.	Belki, maňa has köp wagt gerek.
I did it with you today	Men bu gün seniň bilen etdim
This is strange.	Bu geň.
Then he comes back and tells me everything about it.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp gelýär we maňa bu hakda hemme zady aýdýar.
This is not a girl.	Bu gyz däl.
No need for that.	Munuň üçin zerur däl.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Indi bu hakda gürleşmek islämok.
I decided	Men karar berdim
I found it strange.	Men muny geň gördüm.
I can only think of two.	Men diňe iki hakda pikir edip bilerin.
There is good news and bad news tonight	Şu gije gowy habar we erbet habar bar
He was completely crazy about me.	Ol meniň hakda düýbünden däli boldy.
Interesting.	Gyzykly.
I agree with that.	Men muňa razy boldum.
I have been here several times	Men bu ýerde birnäçe gezek boldum
Even a girl.	Hatda gyz.
He does this every day.	Ol muny her gün edýär.
First time, then many times.	Ilkinji gezek, soň bolsa köp gezek.
The question is not easy.	Sorag aňsat däl.
There is no one but me.	Menden başga hiç kim ýok.
How.	Nähili.
You can only see it.	Muny diňe görüp bilersiňiz.
Seems like a good idea.	Gowy pikir ýaly bolup görünýär.
I saw someone else	Men başga birini gördüm
I'm ready to go now.	Men häzir gitmäge taýyn.
We, we.	We, we.
That would be really nice.	Bu hakykatdanam bir zat bolardy.
This is really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet.
It does.	Şeýle edýär.
I have a question	Mende bir sorag bar
Of course, no one can.	Elbetde, hiç kim bolup bilmez.
A guy	Bir ýigit.
There was something else about them.	Olar hakda başga zat bardy.
But that is not possible.	Bu ýöne mümkin däl.
Two things can be seen here.	Iki zat şu ýerde görünýär.
Maybe not at home tonight	Belki, şu gije öýde bolmaz
He doesn't want to do that.	Ol muny etmek islemeýär.
He is.	Ol şeýle.
I can't even see what's there	Ol ýerde näme bardygyny hem görüp bilemok
I was not happy.	Men bagtly däldim.
I hoped it would not be against it	Men muňa garşy bolmaz diýip umyt etdim
You are nothing to him.	Sen onuň üçin hiç zat däl.
For him.	Onuň üçin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there	Muny gowy eden zat
It was not his business.	Bu onuň işi däldi.
They are not difficult now.	Olar häzir kyn däl.
I have to go there immediately	Men derrew ol ýere gitmeli
Good.	Gowy.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim
This is not a question.	Bu sorag däl.
Almost no one did.	Hiç kim diýen ýaly etmedi.
This is new.	Bu täze.
I saw it myself.	Men muny özüm gördüm.
This is not an impossible problem.	Bu mümkin däl mesele däl.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
To get.	Almak üçin.
Not really you	Aslynda sen däl
It's kind of gone	Ol bir hili gitdi
I can't do it anymore	Indi edip bilemok
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
I have never thought of such a thing	Munuň ýaly zatlar hakda hiç wagt pikir etmedim
We have.	Biz bar.
The man is strange.	Adam geň.
No one helped him.	Hiç kim oňa kömek etmedi.
For him, it was nothing.	Onuň üçin bu hiç zat däldi.
I may have.	Mende bolup biler.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
There may be two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bolup biler.
Great guy	Ajaýyp ýigit.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
They really are.	Olar hakykatdanam şeýle.
I can relax a bit	Biraz dynç alyp bilerin
I look like a fool	Men samsyk ýaly
We are not much here.	Biz bu ýerde kän däl.
I need someone there	Ol ýerde kimdir biri gerek
I told her everything	Men oňa hemme zady aýtdym
I didn't think much of it	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmedim
That's a lot of questions.	Bu gaty köp sorag.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
The same crazy issue.	Şol bir däli mesele.
I can't get it	Men muny alyp bilemok
There.	Ol ýerde.
This is me	Bu özüm.
I think there will be more	Has köp zat bolar diýip pikir edýärin
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
You have to buy more.	Has köp zat satyn almaly.
There is another here.	Bu ýerde başga biri bar.
I had so much fun doing that	Muny etmek üçin gaty hezil boldum
Not there.	Ol ýerde däl.
This is the best way.	Bu iň gowy ýol.
I'm fine now	Men häzir gowy
He is as much as I am.	Ol meniň ýaly köp.
Not just for me, but for everyone.	Diňe meniň üçin däl, hemmeler üçin.
It really helped me.	Bu hakykatdanam maňa kömek etdi.
I do everything for you	Men seniň üçin hemme zady edýärin
I think he might still be a little busy	Onuň henizem birneme meşgul bolmagy mümkin diýip pikir edýärin
Not long.	Uzak däl.
I'm calling again.	Men ýene jaň edýärin.
It's closer, though.	Bu has ýakyn, ýöne.
He doesn't like me.	Ol meni halamaýar.
He would need it.	Oňa mätäç bolardy.
It makes me happy.	Meni bagtly edýär.
I'm not sure he'll do that	Onuň muny etjekdigine ynanamok
I doubt that.	Men muňa şübhelenýärin.
She likes it.	Ol ony halaýar.
That's right- this is not about me.	Munuň üçin gaty dogry.
I believe that because the way is different.	Men muňa ynanýaryn, sebäbi ýol başga.
Who does he think of?	Ol kim hakda pikir edýär?
I wondered what he would think of it	Men bu hakda näme pikir eder diýip pikir etdim
You have to pay attention.	Üns bermeli.
I think he did something clever	Meniň pikirimçe, bu akylly bir zat etdi
It was nothing more.	Bu başga zat däldi.
I think it will be bad	Bu erbet bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I'm so sorry for her	Men onuň üçin gaty gynanýaryn
This often happens.	Bu köplenç bolýar.
Everyone thinks so.	Hemmeler şeýle pikir edýär.
So that was not the case.	Şonuň üçin bu mesele däldi.
I thought about it.	Men bu barada pikir etdim.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I think he gave it to me	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny maňa berdi
It's not that good anymore.	Indi beýle gowy däl diýen ýaly.
Everything that can happen.	Bolup biljek her bir iş.
I can see it for myself	Men muny özüm görüp bilýärin
In fact, I didn't think much of it at the time	Aslynda şol wagt kän pikir etmedim
I didn't know what had happened	Näme bolandygyny bilmedim
He is not there yet.	Ol entek ýok.
I'm sure it will work out.	Gowy iş etjekdigine ynanýaryn.
For better or worse, this is a fact of life.	Gowy ýa-da erbet, bu durmuş hakykaty.
And that's not the case.	We beýle däl.
What is this, for himself.	Bu näme, özi üçin.
Now I can do something to help	Häzir kömek etmek üçin bir zat edip bilerin
Maybe that's a good thing.	Belki, bu gowy zat.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim
I will think a lot about you.	Men sen hakda köp pikir ederin.
I was not at the time	Men şol wagt däldim
Okay, that's weird.	Bolýar, bu geň.
He is a good man.	Ol gowy adam.
I do this once.	Men muny bir gezek edýärin.
I didn't have to go with a girl	Bir gyz bilen gitmeli däldim
This is crazy.	Bu bir däli.
Not so, not anymore.	Beýle däl, indi däl.
This can be both good and bad.	Bu hem gowy, hem erbet bolup biler.
I think it will help well	Gowy kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin
I didn’t want to sound stupid	Men samsyk ses bermek islemedim
I told you.	Men saňa aýtdym.
Sing that day.	Şol gün aýdym aýdyň.
I had everything, everything everyone wanted	Mende hemme zat, her kimiň islän zady bardy
To go	Gitmek
Nothing can be done.	Hiç zat edip bolmaz.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
Tell him.	Oňa aýdyň.
I want this with you	Muny seniň bilen isleýärin
I'll be fine.	Men gowy bolaryn.
I have to go and get it	Men gitmeli we almaly
That was not a lie.	Bu ýalan däldi.
This is work.	Bu iş.
The bad news is everywhere.	Erbet habar hemme ýerde.
I have a lot to say.	Köp zat aýtmaly.
I think this is great	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir edýärin
I have nothing to worry about	Alada etjek zadym ýok
This is a question.	Bu sorag.
I still think that's right	Men henizem dogry diýip pikir edýärin
I could not see	Men görüp bilmedim
It would only be a month and something else.	Diňe bir aý we başga bir zat bolardy.
I can't go home anymore	Indi öýe baryp bilemok
I'm worried about something	Men bir zat hakda gaty alada edýärin
I don't want to think about it.	Bu hakda pikir etmek islämok.
He says he wants to give it to me.	Muny maňa bermek isleýändigini aýdýar.
He did not call police.	Ol polisiýa jaň etmedi.
This is crazy.	Bu däli.
It should take several years.	Birnäçe ýyl gerek bolmaly.
Which is good.	Haýsy gowy.
I think he is serious	Meniň pikirimçe, ol çynlakaý
Not hard to get, no, not hard to get.	Almak kyn däl, ýok, almak kyn däl.
He told me that.	Ol muny maňa aýtdy.
I told her I didn't have to	Men oňa hökman däldigini aýtdym
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
It's been a long time coming.	Köp wagt geldi.
Of course it can.	Elbetde bolup biler.
I think there is another way	Başga bir ýol bar diýip pikir edýärin
This is not the case tonight.	Şu gün agşam beýle däl.
This is giving and receiving.	Bu bermek we almak.
He just stayed there.	Ol diňe şol ýerde galdy.
He has something to do.	Onuň etmeli işi bar.
This is not so much.	Bu beýle kän däl.
I can't even do it.	Hatda edip bilemok.
What?	Näme?
I don't think so, but it could be.	Beýle pikir etmeýärin, ýöne bolup biler.
There really is no other way.	Hakykatdanam başga ýol ýok.
It's very close.	Bu gaty ýakyn.
Next time	Indiki wagtda.
Very good stuff here.	Bu ýerde gaty gowy zatlar.
They are different things.	Olar başga zatlar.
I can help with the answer	Jogap bilen kömek edip bilerin
There is no such thing now.	Häzir beýle zat ýok.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
They were not.	Olar beýle däldi.
I didn’t think it was possible	Mümkin däl diýip pikir etmedim
I couldn't even see	Men hatda görüp bilmedim
There is no sound here.	Bu ýerde ses ýok.
Now is not the time.	Indi wagt däl.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
I was happy.	Men bagtly boldum.
Hard way.	Kyn ýol.
I know this is not always easy.	Munuň elmydama aňsat däldigini bilýärin.
I doubt he can see me	Meni görüp biljekdigine şübhelenýärin
I don't have that much time	Mende beýle köp wagt ýok
The work is very difficult.	Iş gaty kyn.
I did, it was good	Men etdim, gowy boldy
I'm not really surprised.	Men hakykatdanam geň däl.
Maybe three.	Belki üç bolup biler.
It should be, but where.	Ol bolmaly, ýöne nirede.
I couldn't do it	Men oňa edip bilmedim
Someone else did.	Başga biri etdi.
I don't believe that	Men muňa ynanamok
He knew it was going to happen.	Ol munuň boljakdygyny bilýärdi.
Maybe he's here.	Belki, ol şu ýerde.
You need it now.	Häzirki wagtda size gerek.
I could never do that	Men muny hiç haçan edip bilmedim
Probably not.	Beýle däl bolsa gerek.
In fact, he was surprised.	Aslynda ol geň galdy.
I don't need it anymore	Maňa indi gerek däl
I've done it twice now	Men indi iki gezek etdim
I never liked it.	Men muny hiç haçan gowy görmedim.
These are serious things.	Bu çynlakaý zatlar.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
Is that so?	Ol şeýlemi?
He is not.	Ol beýle zat däl.
I hoped it was the same	Öňküsi diýip umyt etdim
Not long.	Uzak däl.

Just like now	Edil şu wagt ýaly.
This is not a good thing.	Bu gowy zat däl.
It's not good to buy.	Almak gowy däl.
I thought it was great	Gaty gowy diýip pikir etdim
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
I had to let you know.	Maňa habar bermeli boldum.
I have to be at home.	Men öýde bolmaly.
I did everything right	Men hemme zady dogry etdim
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
I want to be such a good person.	Munuň ýaly gowy adam bolmak isleýärin.
It was necessary, he said.	Zerur boldy, özi aýtdy.
He had not been home for many years.	Ol köp ýyl bäri öýde ýokdy.
It just seemed right.	Bu edil dogry ýalydy.
I think that will definitely be the case	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hökman bolar
He was absolutely right.	Ol düýbünden dogry aýtdy.
I still think.	Men henizem pikir edýärin.
This is a good thing for them.	Bu olar üçin gowy zat.
I didn’t really help him much	Men oňa hakykatdanam kän kömek etmedim
Of course, everyone does that.	Elbetde, her kim muny edýär.
Then he told us.	Soň bize aýtdy.
I'm thinking of you	Men sen hakda pikir edýärin
Only tonight.	Diňe şu gije.
He knew it by heart.	Ol muny ýatdan bilýärdi.
I think that helped him	Bu oňa kömek etdi diýip pikir edýärin
That would be bad.	Bu erbet bolardy.
It was too short.	Bu gaty gysga boldy.
The sound is incorrect.	Ses dogry däl.
I hope you can do the same	Muny hem edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt edýärin
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
Only this makes you a bad person.	Diňe bu sizi erbet adam edýär.
There was only one problem.	Diňe bir mesele bardy.
I just can't tell you	Diňe saňa aýdyp biljek däl
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
This is often not the case.	Köplenç beýle däl.
It was as if nothing had happened.	Hiç zat ýok ýalydy.
I'd like to see more.	Has köp zady görmek isleýärin.
He is not crazy at all.	Ol düýbünden däli däl.
Not me, man.	Men däl, adam.
Maybe something else.	Belki başga zatlar.
Impossible, too fast.	Mümkin däl, gaty çalt.
I don't believe that	Men muňa ynanamok
It was good for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy boldy.
That's what happened to me.	Meniň üçin şeýle boldy.
Not true.	Dogry däl.
It can be very difficult for him.	Oňa gaty kyn bolup biler.
He says two things.	Iki zady aýdýar.
Big.	Uly.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
What can we say about that?	Bu barada näme aýdyp bileris?
He had to let you know.	Ol size habar bermeli boldy.
I told the truth, I couldn't do it anymore	Men hakykaty aýtdym, indi edip bilmedim
I got it all on my own	Hemmesini ýeke özüm aldym
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan söz.
I was not against it at all	Men asla garşy däldim
Something about the sun.	Gün hakda bir zat.
He had no choice.	Oňa mümkinçilik ýokdy.
I know he can.	Edip biljekdigini bilýärin.
There may be two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bolup biler.
Of course I had fun	Elbetde hezil etdim
It's a really good job	Aslynda gaty gowy iş
This year has been great.	Bu ýyl gaty gowy zatlar boldy.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
One, two, three.	Bir, iki, üç.
I told you so.	Men saňa bu hakda aýtdym.
He took it.	Ol ony aldy.
I don't believe that	Men muňa ynanamok
I don't have to give it to you	Men muny saňa bermeli däl
That's what happened.	Ol şeýle boldy.
There are more reasons to do this	Muny etmegiň has köp sebäbi bar
There was no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýokdy.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
When, he can't say.	Haçan, aýdyp bilmeýär.
This is the last time.	Bu soňky gezek.
I would agree with that	Men muňa razy bolaryn
I didn't see it that way	Men ony beýle görmedim
New hope.	Täze umyt.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, munuň sebäbi.
Therefore.	Şonuň üçin.
I hope it helps.	Kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
He does it.	Ol muny edýär.
It only happens one day.	Bu diňe bir gün bolýar.
I don't care.	Men bu barada alada etmeýärin.
This is more difficult.	Bu has kyn.
I didn't do it myself	Men bu işi özüm etmedim
I really will.	Men hakykatdanam ederin.
Impossible, but difficult.	Mümkin däl, ýöne kyn.
That sounds like a good idea to me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy pikir ýaly.
I never thought something like this would happen	Munuň ýaly bir zadyň boljakdygyny hiç wagt pikir etmedim
It was already there.	Öňem bardy.
I'm not good enough for you	Men senden ýeterlik däl
Then he will come back.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp geler.
So both are the same thing.	Şonuň üçin ikisi-de bir zat.
What a man he was.	Ol nähili adam däldi.
I had to stop doing that	Men muny etmegi bes etmeli boldum
He will do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly eder.
This is bad.	Bu erbet.
I did it a few years ago, it's easier and faster.	Mundan birnäçe ýyl ozal etdim, has aňsat we çalt.
There could be more.	Has köp zat bolup biler.
I have to be.	Men bolmaly.
I'll take care of that.	Men bu barada alada etjek.
He is not today.	Ol şu gün däl.
Of course he wants to be there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde bolmak isleýär.
At that time.	Ol wagt.
Does he know or not?	Bilýärmi ýa dälmi?
I think this is a great book	Bu gaty gowy kitap diýip pikir edýärin
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gowy pikir, ýöne bu dogry däl.
We need life.	Bize durmuş gerek.
You have to do whatever you want.	Islän zadyny etmeli.
It will always be.	Hemişe bolar.
You are happy	Sen bagtly
This is our last.	Bu biziň iň soňky.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim
Why? 	Näme üçin?

It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
I think you should go there	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ýere gitmeli
Something seems wrong to me.	Bir zat maňa gaty dogry däl ýaly.
Now at home.	Indi öýde.
Who knows.	Kim bilýär.
Not much to do, but one thing.	Köp etmeli däl, ýöne bir zat.
Maybe not for everyone, but it was for me.	Belki hemmeler üçin däl, ýöne meniň üçin boldy.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Şol wagt indi.
I want to be with you	Men siziň bilen bolmak isleýärin
If anything.	Bir zat bar bolsa.
I trust you completely	Saňa doly ynanýaryn
I haven't seen him much	Men ony kän görmedim
I heard someone.	Birini eşitdim.
I could do nothing about it.	Men bu barada hiç zat edip bilmedim.
The man would be fine	Adam gowy bolardy
That would be the case.	Bu edil şeýle bolardy.
He knew he was going to do it.	Etjekdigini bilýärdi.
I couldn't pay attention to him	Men oňa üns berip bilmedim
I really don't need anything	Maňa hakykatdanam hiç zat gerek däl
Only they.	Diňe olar.
That alone will not be the case.	Diňe beýle bolmaz.
Good, very good.	Gowy, gaty gowy.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
Now he could see.	Indi görüp bilýärdi.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.

I admire you for that	Munuň üçin saňa haýran
He said he wanted to go home.	Öýüne gitmek isleýändigini aýtdy.
And it will never happen.	We asla bolmaz.
Everyone is for themselves	Her bir adam özi üçin
I just couldn’t be	Diňe bolup bilmedim
I didn't see anything	Men hiç zat görmedim
I immediately thought of you	Men derrew sen hakda pikir etdim
It doesn't seem to be there.	Ol ýerde ýok ýaly.
Of course, he knew it now.	Elbetde, ol häzir bilýärdi.
I was not the same person	Men şol bir adam däldim

I'm sorry and I'm worried	Bagyşlaň we alada edýärin
You may agree.	Razy bolup bilersiňiz.
If not here's a new product just for you!	Bu dynç güni däl bolsa, ýakyn wagtda.
Not surprisingly, you might think.	Geň däl, pikir edip bilersiňiz.
I think this will be good for me	Bu meniň üçin gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
He is not even an adult.	Ol hatda uly adam hem däl.
That's one thing.	Ine bir zat.
This question is very difficult.	Bu sorag gaty kyn.
There were only two people in the house.	Öýde diňe iki adam bardy.
I never thought of you	Men seni asla pikir etmedim
I saw everything	Men hemme zady gördüm
Okay.	Bolýar.
I want to make you happy	Men seni bagtly etmek isleýärin
Here he comes home.	Ine, öýüne gelýär.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.

I think that is the answer	Meniň pikirimçe, bu jogap
This is a year ago.	Bu bir ýyl ozal.
I never wanted to, but I did it for work	Hiç haçan islemedim, ýöne iş üçin etdim
You have to do something.	Bir zatlar etmeli.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
It exists and it does not.	Ol bar we ýok.
I thought about it	Men bu hakda pikir etdim
It didn't take long to decide.	Karar bermek üçin köp wagt gerek däldi.
I was not happy.	Men bagtly däldim.
I saw a lot there	Men ol ýerde köp zady gördüm
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
This is every day.	Bu her gün.
Of course, I didn't see it that way.	Elbetde, özümi beýle görmedim.
I'll do something else.	Başga bir zat ederin.
You can do the same.	Şeýle hem bolup bilersiňiz.
I just saw it	Men täze gördüm
She is really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy.
The same thing.	Şol bir zat.
She really wants it	Ol hakykatdanam erbet isleýär
What was the reason for this?	Mende näme sebäp bardy?
I already have a problem	Mende öňem bir mesele bar
It was a long strange night.	Uzak geň gije boldy.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I tried it several times.	Birnäçe gezek synap gördüm.
I think there are two things here.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýerde iki zat bar.
I can't speak	Men gürläp bilemok
For good reason.	Gowy sebäp bilen.
I can't go anywhere	Men hiç ýere gidip bilemok
It was a good meal.	Gowy nahar boldy.
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
He could not return.	Ol ýere gaýdyp bilmedi.
I couldn’t think of a worse idea	Has erbet pikir hakda pikir edip bilmedim
It was two in the morning.	Irden iki boldy.
You are not like us	Sen biziň ýaly däl
I didn’t think he wanted to talk about it	Ol bu hakda gürleşmek isleýär öýdemokdym
To worry about	Alada etmek.
Man cannot buy anywhere, anywhere	Adam hiç ýerde, hiç ýerde satyn alyp bilmez
It may take several hours.	Birnäçe sagat bolup biler.
Now you know everything.	Indi hemme zady bilýärsiň.
I can't do anything	Men hiç zat edip bilemok
I think that's his job	Meniň pikirimçe, bu onuň işi
I don't think that's the case	Bu mesele däl öýdemok
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda beýle etmeli däl.
He did not call again.	Ol ýene jaň etmedi.
Everyone did it.	Hemmeler muny etdi.
He had to go.	Ol gitmeli boldy.
I hope it helped you	Size kömek etdi diýip umyt edýärin
The man obeyed.	Ol adam boýun boldy.
I can tell completely.	Men doly aýdyp bilerin.
I think it's a while	Biraz wagt galdy öýdýän
I can't see how this happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny görüp bilemok.
I hoped it wasn’t money	Pul däl diýip umyt etdim
You will need something else.	Size başga bir zat gerek bolar.
There was no sound.	Ses hatda ýokdy.
That's great.	Ajaýyp zat.
It was a lot for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty köp zat boldy.
The question came up again.	Sorag ýene geldi.
I couldn't really tell	Men hakykatdanam aýdyp bilmedim
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle däl.
In fact, I didn't know it existed	Aslynda onuň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
Sounds really bad.	Hakykatdanam erbet ýaly.
I helped him, and he knows that	Men oňa kömek etdim, ol muny bilýär
I'm like you	Men seniň ýaly
I was a little nervous	Men birneme biynjalyk boldum
He really does.	Ol hakykatdanam şeýle edýär.
Neither did he.	Şeýle hem etmedi.
She doesn't care.	Oňa alada ýok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Oňa garşy edil şonuň ýaly.
Is there such a thing?	Şeýle zat barmy?
It was fun.	Bu gyzykly boldy.
This is a great idea.	Bu ajaýyp pikir.
Of course, I didn't have fun	Elbetde, hezil etmedim
I didn't think much	Men kän pikir etmedim
I don't know what he wants.	Näme isleýändigini bilenok.
It's just not enough.	Diňe onuň bolmagy ýeterlik däl.
I didn't even see it	Men hatda ony görmedim
This is not the case.	Bu hem şeýle, hem beýle däl.
The night is worse.	Gije has erbet.
I hope so	Beýle bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin
I can't say anything bad about them	Men olar hakda asla erbet zat aýdyp biljek däl
I'll call you a few times	Men size birnäçe jaň ederin
I wondered why he did that	Näme üçin beýle etdi diýip pikir etdim
We both need to rest.	Ikimizem dynç almaly.
I can't do that	Muny edip bilemok
I had it myself.	Mende özüm bardy.
It's hard, but it's fun.	Bu gaty kyn, ýöne gyzykly.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gaty kyn, hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
He asked what he was doing and told him.	Ol näme edýändigini sorady we oňa aýtdy.
It may take weeks.	Birnäçe hepde gerek bolup biler.
A lot of bad things happen	Köp erbet zatlar bolýar
Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
That's all there is to it.	Bu hakykatdanam bar zat.
I don't think so.	Beýle bolmagy mümkin diýip pikir etmeýärin.
I can think for myself	Men özüm pikir edip bilerin
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
I didn't know what to do next	Indiki näme etmelidigimi bilmedim
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
You have to worry about something.	Bir zat hakda alada etmeli.
There will be no such opportunity anymore.	Mundan beýläk beýle mümkinçilik bolmaz.
This is a question.	Bu sorag.
I will even help.	Men hatda kömek ederin.
These things are good!	Bu zatlar gowy!
It takes time to get ready	Oňa taýyn bolmak üçin wagt gerek
And then there were the many.	Soň bolsa köp boldy.
I tried.	Synap gördüm.
This is a big decision.	Bu uly karar.
He is a good guy.	Ol gowy ýigit.
This is not true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry däl.
I really want it	Men ony hakykatdanam gowy isleýärin
I saw this happen.	Munuň bolandygyny gördüm.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
He didn't think so.	Ol beýle pikir etmedi.
OK, that's right.	Bolýar, dogry.
He can't help it.	Oňa kömek edip bilmeýän ýaly.
I'll take it.	Men ol.
I bought it for a while	Biraz wagt satyn aldym
He was the first to start working.	Ilkinji bolup işe başlady.
They were completely new to both of us.	Olar ikimiz üçin düýbünden täze boldy.
I could not see myself completely	Men özümi doly görüp bilmedim
I know how to stop it	Ony nädip bes etmelidigini bilýärin
That can't be good.	Bu gowy bolup bilmez.
He did nothing.	Ol hiç zat etmedi.
Just one night	Diňe bir gije.
You have to be happy.	Sen bagtly bolmaly.
I hoped he was there for the money	Men onuň pul üçin bardygyny umyt etdim
This is something new.	Bu täze zat.
He bought it here.	Ol muny şu ýerde satyn aldy.
I think he knew that too	Meniň pikirimçe, muny hem bilýärdi
And then he told himself.	Soň bolsa özüne aýtdy.
It was a little too much for him today.	Bu gün onuň üçin birneme kän boldy.
It can't be more accurate here.	Bu ýerde has dogry bolup bilmez.
It took two months.	Iki aý gerek boldy.
He can't do it anymore.	Indi edip bilmeýär.
Then he returned very early.	Soň bolsa gaty ir gaýdyp geldi.
He is.	Ol şeýle.
It was great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy boldy.
Tell me everything.	Maňa hemme zady aýdyň.
He never had to do that.	Oňa asla beýle etmek gerek däldi.
These three.	Bu üç.
I was here for that.	Men munuň üçin şu ýerde boldum.
And then it was left.	Soň bolsa galdy.
I could do nothing about it	Men bu hakda hiç zat edip bilmedim
I only saw one.	Diňe birini gördüm.
I'll call him.	Men oňa jaň ederin.
How wonderful life is.	Durmuş nähili ajaýyp.
It was last night.	Düýn gije şol gije boldy.
I knew he had it	Men onuň bardygyny bilýärdim
When does this happen?	Bu haçan bolýar.
I am that, but more.	Men şol, ýöne has köp.
This is not a good time.	Bu gowy wagt däl.
I hope it will be one	Bir bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I didn't know anything else	Başga zat hakda bilmedim
He said it was not bad	Ol erbet däl diýdi
He was right.	Ol gaty dogry aýtdy.
We need to help him more.	Oňa has köp kömek etmeli.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
I couldn't see right.	Dogry görüp bilmedim.
I am right here.	Men şu ýerde dogry.
I didn't do that	Men beýle etmedim
We can do this.	Bu işi edip bileris.
I know more about them	Men olar hakda has köp zat bilýärin
He is still there.	Ol henizem şol ýerde.
This can never happen.	Bu hiç haçan bolup bilmez.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şonuň ýaly bolmaly.
It's kind of.	Bu bir hili.
He's gone now.	Ol indi gitdi.
I can't do anything about it	Men bu hakda hiç zat edip bilemok
I can't think of it anymore	Men indi bu barada pikir edip bilemok
You really are	Siz hakykatdanam
I really didn't know what to do	Hakykatdanam näme etmelidigimi bilmedim
He came.	Ol geldi.
You don't have to do that.	Şeýle etmeli däl.
It will take a lot more work.	Munuň üçin entek has köp iş gerek bolar.
I don't think that's possible.	Bu mümkin däl diýip pikir etmeýärin.
I couldn't see anything, I just heard	Men hiç zady görüp bilmedim, diňe eşitdim
It's not too big.	Ol gaty uly däl.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
These things are good.	Bu zatlar gowy.
I could never be mad at him	Men oňa hiç wagt däli bolup bilmedim
Next.	Indiki.
He wants to know everything.	Hemme zady bilmek isleýär.
I'm still worried about you	Men henizem sen hakda alada edýärin
I was never that person	Men asla beýle adam däldim
There was always something wrong.	Elmydama bir zat ýokdy.
One week, earlier if necessary	Bir hepde, zerur bolsa has ir
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
This is no longer the case.	Bu indi mesele däl.
It was good for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy boldy.
Just like me	Edil meniň ýaly.
I got something good.	Gowy zat aldym.
I really have to go	Men hakykatdanam gitmeli
He was immediately there	Derrew şol ýerde boldy
So it was fun.	Şonuň üçin bu gyzykly boldy.
I had to tell her something	Men oňa bir zat aýtmaly boldum
There was something better.	Iň gowy zady bardy.
I was worried about that	Men bu barada alada etdim
He said no.	Ol indi ýok diýdi.
The news was not good.	Habar gowy däldi.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
I got you something	Men saňa zat aldym
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
I'm not against it.	Men muňa garşy däl.
I knew it would happen	Munuň hem boljakdygyny bilýärdim
I thought about it yesterday	Düýn bu hakda pikir etdim
An hour.	Bir sagat.
You, me, these two guys.	Sen, men, bu iki ýigit.
Not you	Sen däl
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
This time I could not go all night	Bu gezek bütin gije baryp bilmedim
There is so much.	Gaty köp zat bar.
You are with me now	Sen indi meniň bilen
He must have seen what he did yesterday.	Düýn edenini gören bolmaly.
I gave him three days to decide	Karar bermek üçin oňa üç gün berdim
That's exactly what happened to me.	Aslynda maňa şeýle boldy.
He is not now.	Ol şu wagt däl.
This is nothing.	Bu hiç zat däl.
I really have to go.	Men hakykatdanam gitmeli.
Nowadays no one does that.	Häzirki wagtda hiç kim muny etmeýär.
That's right- this is not about me.	Bu meniň üçin dogry.
Just what you know or don't know yet.	Diňe bilýän ýa-da entek bilmeýän zady.
I hope this is something you are ready to do	Bu siziň etmäge taýyn bir zat diýip umyt edýärin
I hope you are very happy.	Gaty bagtly bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin.
He had fun.	Ol hezil etdi.
He could not tell the truth.	Ol dogry aýdyp bilmedi.
I want to see something else	Başga bir zady görmek isleýärin
I can do it again this time	Bu gezek hem edip bilerin
The problem is me.	Mesele men.
I have a lot of doubts about that	Men muňa gaty şübhelenýärin
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Nothing for me.	Meniň üçin hiç zat ýok.
The good things he did	Köp eden gowy zatlary
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
It made me crazy.	Bu meni däli etdi.
I haven't seen you in a while	Birnäçe wagt bäri seni görmedim
I feel sorry for him now.	Men häzir oňa gynanýaryn.
Oh, he knew everything.	Aý, ol hemme zady bilýärdi.
That's the way it is.	Şeýle bolýar.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
I can do something for you	Men siziň üçin bir zat edip bilerin
I've only been there twice	Men ol ýerde diňe iki gezek boldum
I think so	Meniň pikirimçe şeýle bolar
I must know that	Men muny bilýän bolmaly
It will not be easy.	Hökman aňsat bolmaz.
I thought about it and it's there	Men ol hakda pikir etdim we ol şol ýerde
It's too big.	Ol gaty uly.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
I couldn't sleep	Men uklap bilmedim
He could only hope.	Ol diňe umyt edip bilýärdi.
He is a man.	Ol adam.
I want to tell you everything	Men saňa hemme zady aýtmak isleýärin
I can't see right	Dogry görüp bilemok
I fully believe that	Men muňa doly ynanýaryn
He didn't have to.	Ol hökman däldi.
He knows.	Ol bilýär.
Now you don't really need money.	Indi sen, hökman pul gerek däl.
I thought he wanted to know	Ol bilmek isleýär öýdüpdim
They are very bad.	Olar gaty erbet.
A man	Bir adam.
I don't really believe that.	Men muňa hakykatdanam ynanamok.
In fact, I didn't think so.	Aslynda beýle pikir ýokdy.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
I think he's gone	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gitdi
Now you have a decision.	Indi saňa karar bar.
I don't have it anymore.	Mende indi ýok.
He is just like me.	Ol edil meniň ýaly.
I didn’t want to be alone again	Men ýene ýeke bolmak islemedim
I trust you, but that's great	Saňa ynanýaryn, ýöne bu gaty gowy
I have never done anything wrong.	Hiç haçan erbet zat etmedim.
You are not serious and he is.	Siz çynlakaý däl we ol.
I didn’t really know what he could do	Aslynda onuň näme edip biljekdigini bilmeýärdim
In fact, I didn't do anything.	Aslynda hiç zat etmedim.
I couldn't be with him	Men onuň bilen bolup bilmedim
For myself or for giving.	Özüm üçin ýa-da bermek üçin.
You need to hire someone to help you.	Size kömek etmek üçin birini işe almaly.
Of course I don't know.	Elbetde bilemok.
I heard he didn't	Onuň ýokdugyny eşitdim
Now they are.	Indi olar bar.
I have seen this happen several times	Munuň birnäçe gezek bolandygyny gördüm
Everything caused me.	Hemme zat maňa sebäp boldy.
It can't be more accurate here.	Bu ýerde has dogry bolup bilmez.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Of course, there was no question.	Elbetde, ol ýerde sorag ýokdy.
I would have.	Mende bolardy.
I think that's great	Bu gaty gowy diýip pikir edýärin
I have to give it to you.	Maňa bermeli.
It's beautiful.	Bu owadan.
They both do the same.	Ikisi-de şol bir işi edýär.
I thought about it	Men bu pikir hakda pikir etdim
Absolutely not there.	Ol ýerde düýbünden ýok.
I could not	Men edip bilmedim
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
I was happy.	Men bagtly boldum.
I only heard one voice.	Men diňe bir ses eşitdim.
He will probably come in the evening.	Ol, belki, agşam geler.
You have to do better.	Munuň üçin has gowy iş etmeli.
I didn't care.	Alada etmedim.
I was trying to figure it out	Özüni pikir ederin diýip pikir etjek boldum
Probably not.	Belki ýokdy.
It just bothers me.	Bu diňe meni biynjalyk edýär.
I can't see it anywhere	Men ony hiç ýerde görüp bilemok
There is time.	Wagt bar.
It will be the same.	Bu edil şonuň ýaly bolar.
You are human.	Sen adam.
He will return.	Ol gaýdyp geler.
It was not yesterday or today.	Ol düýn ýa-da şu gün däldi.
I said it, but it wasn't me	Men aýtdym, ýöne menden däldi
Oh, this year.	Aý, şu ýyl.
In fact, it was not.	Aslynda beýle bolmaly däldi.
They are.	Olar.
So that's great.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty gowy.
I asked him three questions.	Men oňa üç sorag berdim.
He is alone.	Ol ýeke.
I'm not a guy anymore.	Men indi ýigit däl.
He said he knew and would.	Bilýändigini we biljekdigini aýtdy.
He wants it.	Ol muny isleýär.
There must be something.	Bir zat bolmaly.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
I have already decided	Men eýýäm karar berdim
I have never been able to do that	Men hiç wagt beýle zady edip bilmedim
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
We need it.	Bize gerek.
Such a good girl.	Şeýle gowy gyz.
What can we do to help you today?	Bu gün size näme kömek edip bileris?
I'm not that girl anymore	Men indi ol gyz däl
I've seen it before.	Men muny öňem gördüm.
I am very smart myself.	Men özüm gaty akylly.
About what they know.	Bilýän zatlary hakda.
I didn't want to call anyone	Hiç kime jaň etmek islemedim
Someone can answer that.	Kimdir biri muňa jogap berip biler.
I have to do everything myself	Hemme zady özüm etmeli
Strange.	Geň.
I will be fine alone this year	Bu ýyl ýeke özüm gowy bolaryn
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýere gelýär.
Everything seems to be fine.	Hemme zat gowy ýaly.
I saw that he did not want to talk about it	Men onuň bu hakda gürleşmek islemeýändigini gördüm
This is great	Bu gaty ajaýyp
I think this girl	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gyz
Nothing will happen.	Hiç zat bolmaz.
Of course, I was immediately.	Elbetde, derrew boldum.
I'm having fun here.	Men bu ýerde hezil edýärin.
It was not what he wanted.	Ol islän zady däldi.
I can get it here tomorrow	Men ony ertir bu ýere alyp bilerin
It's very easy to see.	Muny görmek gaty aňsat.
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
Good for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin gowy.
That's a lot of money.	Bu gaty köp pul.
This is not a big deal.	Bu beýle bir uly mesele däl.
He did not call police.	Ol polisiýa jaň etmedi.
That morning.	Şol gün irden.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
And very young.	We gaty ýaş.
I saw you here a while ago	Men sizi bu ýerde birneme öň gördüm
I didn't want to go home	Öýe gitmek islemedim
It would be bad.	Erbet bolardy.
And then the face.	Soň bolsa ýüz.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
And then he got it.	Soň bolsa ony aldy.
I don't have to worry about that	Men bu barada alada etmeli däl
We can.	Biz edip bileris.
This must be very difficult for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty kyn bolmaly.
I know this is difficult for you	Munuň saňa kyn bolandygyny bilýärin
I can't go there anymore	Indi ol ýere gidip bilemok
It was not easy.	Bu beýle aňsat däldi.
All you can say is.	Diňe aýdyp bilersiňiz.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
I can't give it to him	Men oňa berip bilemok
Of course, this is not an easy task.	Elbetde, bu aňsat iş däl.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh!	Bu hakda gürleşmek.
Only more.	Diňe has köp.
He did not do such a thing.	Munuň ýaly zat etmedi.
Not a girl.	Bir gyz däl.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
I didn't have to go far	Uzak gitmeli däldim
Great, but weird.	Ajaýyp, ýöne geň.
This book looks great.	Bu kitap gaty gowy görünýär.
Not just them.	Diňe olar däl.
He doesn't want to see me anymore.	Ol meni indi görmek islemeýär.
He would have agreed a few years ago.	Birnäçe ýyl ozal razy bolardy.
I didn't want to see him again	Men ony ýene görmek islemedim
Then the police called.	Soň polisiýa jaň etdi.
I'm fine.	Men gowy.
So this is not true.	Şonuň üçin bu dogry däl.
Is there still the same thing here or not?	Bu ýerde henizem şol bir zat barmy ýa dälmi?
This is clear.	Bu aýdyň.
Another one, another one.	Başga biri, başga biri.
I knew it wasn't going to bother me, but it did	Munuň meni biynjalyk etmeli däldigini bilýärdim, ýöne şeýle etdi
He was not a prisoner.	Ol tussag däldi.
It helped, but not enough.	Bu kömek etdi, ýöne ýeterlik däldi.
They were not there tonight.	Bu gije olar ýokdy.
This is still possible.	Bu henizem mümkin.
I thought you were great	Sen ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim
It will be good for him too.	Bu hem oňa gowy bolar.
The police want to talk to you.	Polisiýa siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýär.
I am just a happy person	Men diňe bir bagtly adam
This is happening everywhere.	Bu hemme ýerde bolýar.
I didn't want to talk to him like that.	Men onuň bilen beýle gürleşmek islemedim.
I didn’t want it or not	Men muny islemedim ýa-da islemedim
No need.	Gerek däldi.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
There.	Ol ýerde.
It seemed like a good idea.	Gowy pikir ýalydy.
I think that's great	Bu gaty gowy diýip pikir edýärin
I heard about you	Men sen hakda eşitdim
I haven't been like this in a while.	Birnäçe wagt bäri beýle däldim.
Not everyone knows everything.	Hemme zat hemme zady bilmeýär.
Of course, this is possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin.
It's just too hard.	Diňe gaty kyn.
There is one there.	Ol ýerde biri bar.
I couldn't do anything better now.	Men indi has gowy zat edip bilmedim.
I always want to be with you	Men hemişe siziň bilen bolmak isleýärin
Not much anymore.	Indi kän däl.
I can't answer you because	Men saňa jogap berip bilemok, sebäbi
He is still somewhere.	Ol henizem bir ýerde.
It made me happy.	Meni bagtly etdi.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
This is probably a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele bolsa gerek.
Someone else.	Başga biri.
Just knowing that.	Diňe muny bilmek.
There may be several reasons for this.	Aslynda munuň birnäçe sebäbi bolup biler.
Do whatever you want	Islän zadyny et.
To be here	Bu ýerde bolmak.
Be in the morning	Irden ol.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat gowy.
I can't believe it anymore.	Indi muňa ynanamok.
He also has.	Ol hem bar.
I did nothing for you or me	Men seniň ýa-da meniň üçin hiç zat etmedim
She seemed to know everything about him.	Ol hakda hemme zady bilýän ýalydy.
I gave him a job.	Men oňa iş berdim.
You have to help him.	Oňa kömek etmeli.
Not at all.	Asla ýok.
It's been two weeks.	Iki hepde uzak wagt.
I can't be in one place.	Men bir ýerde bolup bilemok.
Not everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilmeýär.
Life is great.	Durmuş gaty gowy.
I didn't see that	Men muny görmedim
I've heard a lot about you.    	Men sen hakda köp eşitdim.    
I saw something interesting	Gyzykly bir zady gördüm
This was not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman beýle däldi.
This is a really good thing I think.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň pikirimçe gaty gowy zat.
Then again last night.	Soň ýene düýn agşam.
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
He seemed completely stupid.	Ol düýbünden samsyk ýalydy.
You know what that does to me.	Munuň meni näme edýändigini bilýärsiň.

There is no one.	Hiç bir adam ýok.
He wanted to.	Ol isledi.
It will be more difficult.	Bu has kyn bolar.
The police did nothing.	Polisiýa hiç zat etmedi.

No one there wants to see you.	Ol ýerde hiç kim seni görmek islemeýär.
I knew nothing about him	Men ol hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
Once upon a time I was like myself.	Men bir gezek özüm ýaly boldum.

Can anyone help me?	Maňa kömek edip biljek barmy?
This is a good thing for me right now.	Bu meniň üçin şu wagt gowy zat.

Of course, he is right.	Elbetde, dogry aýdýar.
It will be interesting.	Gyzykly bolar.
I could do nothing about it	Men bu barada hiç zat edip bilmedim

You are a wonderful person.	Siz, ajaýyp ajaýyp adam.

Something else is right.	Başga bir zat dogry.
There are only two issues.	Diňe iki mesele.
It's fun to be with her.	Onuň bilen bolmak gyzykly.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
You don't have to say a word.	Bir söz aýtmak hökman däl.
He already knew that.	Ol muny eýýäm bilýärdi.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
Knowing that it happened.	Bolandygyny bilmek.

This is so.	Bu şeýle.
I can't help it anymore	Men oňa indi kömek edip bilemok
He also objected.	Ol hem muňa garşy çykdy.
I did not want help	Kömek islemedim
It helps him do that.	Oňa muny etmäge kömek edýär.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
How long has it been?	Näçe wagt boldy.
I asked you a question.	Size bir sorag berdim.

I am very good	Men gaty gowy
I didn’t think it was that bad	Munuň beýle erbet bolandygyny pikir etmedim
This can be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolup biler.
It did him a disservice.	Bu oňa birneme zyýan berdi.
This is life.	Bu durmuş.
I think this will be a very, very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy, gaty gowy zat bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
It will never happen.	Bu asla bolmaz.
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
It is important to know what can happen.	Näme bolup biljekdigini bilmek zerur.
Then you have to rest.	Soň dynç almaly.
I'm somewhere else.	Men başga bir ýerde.
So you can think about it.	Şonuň üçin bu hakda pikir edip bilersiňiz.
Sounds good.	Gowy zat ýaly.

I don't know why.	Näme üçin bilemok.
That was not the case.	Bu mesele däldi.
I don't know what happened	Näme bolandygyny bilemok
He tried to help.	Kömek etjek boldy.
Not next time.	Indiki gezek ýok.
He will do it now.	Indi muny eder.
This will help you.	Bu size kömek eder.
It was very difficult	Bu gaty kyn boldy
He could see nothing.	Ol hiç zat görüp bilmedi.
Because it is clear.	Sebäbi aýdyň görünýär.
They are never necessarily.	Olar hiç haçan hökman däl.
This may take some time	Bu birneme wagt bolup biler
It was a little too much for him today	Bu gün onuň üçin birneme kän boldy
It will be easier for us.	Bu biziň üçin has aňsat bolar.
The same stupid things.	Şol bir samsyk zatlar.

I stopped thinking a lot about those things	Men ol zatlar hakda köp pikir etmegi bes etdim
I never thought this would happen	Munuň beýle boljakdygyny hiç wagt pikir etmedim
You can go and get ready.	Gidip, taýyn bolup bilersiňiz.
If the worst is to happen.	Iň erbet zat bolmaly bolsa.

Everyone wants something.	Her kim bir zat isleýär.
I had to give it to him	Men oňa bermeli boldum
I just didn’t want to talk about it	Diňe bu hakda gürleşmek islemedim
He doesn't do that for me.	Muny meniň üçin etmeýär.
I know this is not the case	Munuň beýle däldigini bilýärin
The most beautiful thing he didn't really know.	Iň owadan zat, hakykatdanam bilmeýärdi.
Anyone and everyone can do that.	Muny her kim we her kim edip biler.
I have no one else	Mende başga hiç kim ýok
What could be the reason for this?	Munuň sebäbi näme bolup biler?
Not necessarily twice.	Iki gezek hökman bolup bilmez.
It’s not much, but it’s life.	Bu kän däl, ýöne durmuş.
I don't want to talk about it.	Bu hakda gürleşmek islämok.
I was not ready for that	Men muňa beýle taýyn däldim
Help me now.	Indi maňa kömek et.
This is a beautiful thing.	Bu owadan zat.

Does he even know that or not?	Ol hatda muny bilýärmi ýa dälmi?
I couldn't tell him anything	Men oňa hiç zat aýdyp bilmedim
He didn't care.	Ol alada etmedi.
Maybe you can think of them.	Belki, olar hakda pikir edip bilersiňiz.
He was surprised, surprised.	Ol geň galdy, geň galdy.
And then he does the same thing.	Soň bolsa edil şol bir zady edýär.
It's long gone.	Uzak gitdi.
You are not a bad person	Sen erbet adam däl
I could not say anything	Men hiç zat aýdyp bilmedim
Everyone knows how this happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny hemmeler bilýär.
I didn't do anything else	Başga zat etmedim
That's right.	Bu dogry.

That's what I want to know.	Ol ýerde bilmek isleýän zady.
A girl who can be more.	Has köp bolup biljek gyz.
So this is a mistake.	Şonuň üçin bu ýalňyşlyk.

Looks like a good guy.	Gowy ýigit ýaly bolup görünýär.

He is not alone.	Ol ýeke-täk däl.
He seemed to want more.	Has köp zady isleýän ýalydy.
This will be the case.	Bu şeýle bolar.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
Not as long as it is, but enough.	Onuň ýaly uzak däl, ýöne ýeterlik.

He gave me a lot, and now he is gone.	Ol meniň üçin köp zat berdi, indi gitdi.
There are two things you can do.	Iki zat edip bilersiňiz.

There was this guy.	Bu ýigit bardy.
I already know how to do this	Bu işi nädip etmelidigini eýýäm bilýärin
I can love you	Men seni gowy görüp bilýärin
I can't really say enough about everything and everything	Men hakykatdanam hemme zat we hemmeler hakda ýeterlik zat aýdyp bilemok
There was another person.	Başga adam boldy.
He helped you.	Ol size kömek etdi.
There must be another way.	Başga ýol bolmaly.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
I never knew what to do about it	Men bu barada näme etmelidigimi hiç wagt bilmeýärdim
Now this is crazy.	Indi bu däli.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
You have to give it to him.	Oňa bermeli.
I don’t have to think about that	Men bu hakda pikir etmeli däl
Only a few.	Diňe birnäçe.
It will be a good challenge for him. "	Bu onuň üçin gowy kynçylyk bolar "-diýdi.
So this is not possible.	Şonuň üçin bu mümkin däl.
I don't care about you	Men sen hakda alada etmeýärin
I still thought I should call the police	Men henizem polisiýa jaň etmeli diýip pikir etdim
We both have to go.	Ikimizem gitmeli.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
I call in the morning.	Irden jaň edýärin.
There were so many ways here.	Bu ýerde gaty köp ýol bardy.
It was not an easy decision	Bu aňsat karar däldi
I saw it myself.	Men muny özüm gördüm.
I think he understood.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol düşündi.
I only had to leave for a few days	Diňe birnäçe gün gitmeli boldum
I haven't seen it this year.	Men bu ýyl muny görmedim.
Of course, he was not there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde ýokdy.
I know how it was	Onuň nähili bolandygyny bilýärin
One for him, one for me.	Biri onuň üçin, biri meniň üçin diýdi.
This was not the case.	Beýle bolmak beýle däldi.
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýok.
There was never a reason.	Hiç haçan sebäp ýokdy.
Won't be home tonight	Şu gije öýde bolmaz
So that's a good thing.	Şonuň üçin bu gowy zat.
I didn't care before	Men ozal alada etmedim
This will help us.	Bu bize kömek eder.
Maybe not very well.	Belki gaty gowy bolmaz.
I was there one morning.	Men ol ýerde bir gün irden boldum.
I know this can happen to you	Munuň seniň bilen bolup biljekdigini bilýärin
Everything will be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolar.
I hope so	Dogry bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men munuň kän däldigini aýtdym
I told him a lot of truth	Men oňa köp hakykaty aýtdym
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
I didn't think much of it	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmedim
I couldn't tell you that	Muny saňa aýdyp bilmedim
This is not the last time.	Bu soňky gezek däl.
Nothing will happen.	Dogry zat bolmaz.
This was not about the girl, it was not at all.	Bu gyz hakda däl, asla beýle däldi.
He must have been here, but it was too late.	Ol şu ýerde bolmaly, ýöne gijä galdy.
I couldn't tell him.	Men oňa aýdyp bilmedim.
He didn't pay attention to that either.	Ol hem muňa üns bermedi.
This is not the answer.	Bu jogap däl.
You are very close	Siz gaty ýakyn
I must have seen something	Men bir zady gören bolmaly
Maybe for the first time.	Belki ilkinji gezek.
This is a difficult decision.	Bu kyn karar.
I could see it all	Men hemmesini görüp bilýärdim
There was only a girl there.	Ol ýerde diňe gyz bardy.
No one else can give that.	Muny başga hiç kim berip bilmez.
Easier to get.	Almak has aňsat.
It's not that bad. "	Bu beýle erbet däl "-diýdi.
This is a very serious matter.	Bu hakykatdanam çynlakaý zat.
Nothing to worry about.	Alada etmeli zat ýok.
It's not that difficult.	Bu beýle kyn däl.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
I called	Men jaň etdim
You know that.	Muny bilýärsiň.
He is right.	Dogry aýdýar.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
Interesting.	Gyzykly.
They are not at home.	Olar öýde däl.
I should never have let her go with me	Men ony hiç wagt meniň bilen gitmäge ýol bermeli däldim
I hope he knows what he's doing	Näme edýändigini bilýär diýip umyt edýärin
It was not about him.	Ol hakda däldi.
I couldn't do it like that	Men onuň ýaly edip bilmedim
I had fun last night.	Düýn agşam hezil etdim.
I don't know about that.	Men bu hakda bilemok.
I think that's right	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry
I didn't know better	Men has gowy bilmedim
I have to do something	Men bir zat etmeli
You have to be crazy about these things	Bu zatlary berip, däli bolmaly
I didn't want to call him	Men oňa jaň etmek islemedim
He knew it.	Muny özi bilýärdi.
It's been here for three months.	Üç aý bäri şu ýerde.
I couldn't think.	Men pikir edip bilmedim.
He has to.	Ol etmeli.
I told her how it was	Oňa nädip bolandygyny aýtdym
I did that last year	Men muny geçen ýyl etdim
He was with several hundred people.	Ol birnäçe ýüz adam bilen bardy.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
I couldn't sleep anymore	Indi uklap bilmedim
Of something.	Bir zadyň.
I told her it had been a few weeks	Men oňa birnäçe hepde bolandygyny aýtdym
I didn't do it now.	Men häzir etmedim.
This seems serious.	Bu çynlakaý ýaly.
You must be aware that this is not possible.	Munuň mümkin däldigini bilýän bolmaly.
This is good for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy.
I want to go tomorrow	Ertir gitmek isleýärin
For good reason.	Gowy sebäp bilen.
I can't believe it anymore.	Indi ynanamok.
I couldn’t even ask any questions	Hatda hiç hili sorag berip bilmedim
That sounds like a strange idea.	Bu geň pikir ýaly bolup görünýär.
Not you	Sen däl.
No one told him.	Hiç kim oňa aýtmady.
This is no longer true.	Bu indi dogry däl.
He will need it.	Oňa gerek bolar.
I think he should know	Bilýän bolmaly öýdýän
The decision was made.	Karar muny etdi.
I really didn't know	Men hakykatdanam bilmedim
I rested for two days	Iki gün dynç aldym
You are no longer a police officer.	Sen indi polisiýa däl.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
Of course, this is not a bad thing.	Elbetde bu erbet zat däl.
he thought.	diýip pikir etdi.
I can never get an answer	Men hiç haçan jogap alyp bilemok
I can't promise more	Men has köp söz berip bilemok
That would be really nice.	Bu hakykatdanam bir zat bolardy.
I'm not there yet	Men entek ýok
I think this may be true	Bu dogry bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin
So this is not possible.	Şonuň üçin bu mümkin däl.
He had to go.	Ol gitmeli boldy.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
This question is currently under discussion.	Bu sorag häzirki wagtda.
It was new.	Ol täze boldy.
I want to do it for him	Men onuň üçin muny etmek isleýärin
I knew he didn't want to see me	Men onuň meni görmek islemeýändigini bilýärdim
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
It will be the hardest.	Bu iň kyn bolar.
I didn't help much.	Kän kömek etmedim.
He told them not to vote.	Kime ses bermeli däldigini aýtdy.
Really, next week.	Hakykatdanam, indiki hepde.
No one can take me here.	Hiç kim meni bu ýere alyp bilmez.
Of course it will help.	Elbetde, kömek eder.
We are both good.	Ikimizem gowy.
You don't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däl.
Just like him.	Edil onuň ýaly.
Work, stuff.	Iş, zat.
I really trust you	Men saňa hakykatdanam ynanýaryn
It's time to dump her and move on.	Gitmeli wagt geldi.
He could not say.	Ol aýdyp bilmedi.
I saw it.	Men ony gördüm.
I think it should hurt	Zyýan bermeli diýip pikir edýärin
I'm so sorry for him.	Men oňa gaty gynanýaryn.
I have to get it soon	Men ony ýakyn wagtda almaly
I can't say more about that	Men bu hakda has köp zat aýdyp biljek däl
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
It is impossible to get more.	Has köp zady almak mümkin däl.
I thought it was good	Gowy diýip pikir etdim
I don’t think this will be his last.	Bu onuň iň soňky bolar öýdemok.
She had to go home.	Öýüne gitmeli boldy.
Surprisingly, this was not the case.	Geň zat, bu dogry däldi.
Why buy a new one?	Näme üçin täze satyn almaly?
I want to go	Men gitmek isleýärin
It seems impossible.	Mümkin däl ýaly.
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
He asked a question.	Ol sorag berdi.
This is a decision.	Bu karar.
This will be my first time.	Bu meniň ilkinji gezek bolar.
I am always there for you	Men elmydama siziň üçin
I still don't know how he did it.	Onuň muny nädip edendigini henizem bilemok.
I couldn't tell you	Men saňa aýdyp bilmedim
He answered that.	Ol muňa jogap berdi.
I didn't even try	Hatda synap görmedim
You have to do this.	Bu işi etmeli.
This is very serious.	Bu gaty çynlakaý.
I am very good.	Men gaty gowy.
It seems to me like money.	Bu maňa pul ýaly bolup görünýär.
I think he did it just to hurt me.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny diňe maňa zyýan bermek üçin etdi.
The night is coming.	Gije gelýär.
He did too.	Ol hem etdi.
It could be a long time.	Uzak wagt bolup biler.
Only for this week.	Diňe şu hepde üçin.
I'm stupid	Men samsyk.
Ma'am.	Bu.
I'm sorry about that	Men oňa gynanýaryn
Great for relaxing.	Dynç almak üçin ajaýyp.
Only there.	Diňe şol ýerde.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
I said this to say	Muny aýtmak üçin aýtdym
He doesn't have to worry about it.	Ol bu barada alada etmeli däl.
This is what you want.	Bu seniň isleýän zadyň.
I always know that	Men muny hemişe bilýärin
That was not really the case.	Bu hakykatdanam mesele däldi.
I need more than you	Maňa senden has köp zat gerek
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I don't have to	Mende beýle bolmaly däl
He was there.	Ol ýerde bardy.
He knows a lot, a lot.	Köp zat köp zat bilýär.
I must have done something	Men bir zat eden bolmaly
Now what happened.	Indi mesele näme boldy.
That was really bad.	Ine, hakykatdanam erbet boldy.
I have to do that.	Men muny etmeli.
If this is true everywhere, then here it is.	Bu hemme ýerde dogry bolsa, bu ýerde has dogry.
It just has to be fun.	Diňe gyzykly bolmaly.
A good and really beautiful girl	Gowy we hakykatdanam owadan gyz
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
And here it is.	Ine, bu hem bar.
Do you have	Siz barmy?
This is a must.	Bu hökman.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
It was already there.	Öňem bardy.
He wanted to be close to her.	Oňa ýakyn bolmak isledi.
I want to do better	Has gowy zatlar etmek isleýärin
Something could happen.	Bir zat bolup biler.
I couldn't go that far	Men beýle gidip bilmedim
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
I'm sorry to hear that, but that's not the case.	Munuň üçin gynanýaryn, ýöne bu beýle däl.
Now he didn't say the right time.	Indi dogry wagty aýtmady.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hili zat.
It was everywhere.	Hemme ýerde bardy.
Not a book.	Kitap däl.
I think there could be a lot of noise	Gaty köp ses bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin
We have to go.	Biz gitmeli.
That day was not like today.	Şol gün bu gün ýaly däldi.
Maybe a few weeks.	Belki birnäçe hepde.
I always do that	Men muny elmydama edýärin
It takes more time to figure out how to do it.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilmek üçin has köp wagt gerek.
Good question how	Gowy sorag nädip boldy
He wants, he wants.	Ol isleýär, isleýär.
I need another problem	Maňa başga kynçylyk gerek

There was a lot.	Köp zat bardy.
I hope not.	Bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
Next week.	Geljek hepde.
I need it.	Maňa gerek.
I heard about them	Men olar hakda eşitdim
I couldn't do anything like that anymore	Indi hiç zat ýaly edip bilmedim
I was with him an hour ago	Men onuň bilen bir sagat öňem boldum
A lot of fun.	Köp gyzykly.
I care about him.	Men onuň hakda alada edýärin.
It's been a few years.	Birnäçe ýyl boldy.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
Of course, there is no other way.	Elbetde, başga ýol ýok.
I didn't want to talk to them	Men olar bilen gürleşmek islemedim
It's been three days.	Üç gün boldy.
I want to go with him	Men onuň bilen gitmek isleýärin
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
He was not like you.	Ol seniň ýaly däldi.
Maybe this week.	Belki, şu hepde bolar.
I thought about it again last night	Düýn agşam bu barada ýene birneme pikir etdim
There is no such thing.	Ol ýerde beýle zat ýok.
There is something about that.	Bu hakda bir zat bar.
These things can be good or bad.	Bu zatlar gowy ýa-da erbet bolup biler.
I knew nothing about him	Men ol hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
Okay, not so.	Bolýar, beýle däl.

He does what he wants to do.	Etjek bolýan zadyny edýär.
So that's what happens.	Şonuň üçin zatlar şeýle bolýar.
It was not very interesting.	Bu gaty bir gyzykly däldi.
I didn’t think about the future, just the present	Geljek hakda, diňe şu wagt hakda pikir etmedim
I think that's a big deal.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty uly mesele.
I really need it	Maňa gaty zerur
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men munuň mümkin däldigini aýtdym
I just had fun, enough.	Diňe hezil etdim, ýeterlik.
What a word.	Nähili söz.
One can only talk about one thing	Biri diňe bir zat hakda bolup biler
It was not good to go there.	Ol ýere gitmek gowy däldi.
I hope he still thinks so	Ol henizem şeýle pikir edýär diýip umyt edýärin
I really want that	Men muny gaty isleýärin
Things live there.	Ol ýerde zatlar ýaşaýar.
It was not so difficult to do what he did.	Eden zadyny etmek beýle bir kyn däldi.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
No problem here.	Bu ýerde mesele ýok.
Couldn't be.	Bolup bilmedi.
Of course not here.	Elbetde, bu ýerde däl.
I think something else can happen to me now	Meniň pikirimçe, häzir meniň üçin başga zat bolup biler
Good, very good.	Gowy, gaty gowy.
The same is true for you.	Bu siziň üçin hem edil şonuň ýaly.
I couldn't sleep	Men uklap bilmedim
It was not good at all.	Bu asla gowy däldi.
I was home for two days	Men iki gün öýde boldum
I did this a few weeks ago	Men muny birnäçe hepde öň etdim
I don't want to be bad.	Erbet bolmak islämok.
This is no longer necessary.	Bu indi zerur däl.
Not much time.	Wagt köp däl.
I couldn't see it.	Men ony görüp bilmedim.
He just didn't know why.	Diňe näme üçin bilmedi.

Of course no one.	Elbetde hiç kim ýok.
I got it now, he knew it	Men ony häzir aldym, ol muny bilýärdi
He wanted to know.	Ol bilmek isledi.
I'm not ready for that.	Men muňa taýyn däl.
I couldn't think anymore	Indi pikir edip bilmedim
He never wanted anything else.	Ol hiç wagt başga zat islemedi.
I had so many questions, no answers	Mende gaty köp sorag bardy, jogap ýok
Of course, this is not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däl.
Absolutely wonderful.	Elbetde ajaýyp.
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
Right? 	Dogry?
I have to give it to him	Men oňa bermeli
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
You can go too.	Siz hem gidip bilersiňiz.
It's a little late.	Biraz gijä galdy.
I knew it was going to happen	Munuň boljakdygyny bilýärdim
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
In fact, this is not true.	Aslynda bu düýbünden dogry däl.
I really couldn't help it.	Men hakykatdanam kömek edip bilmedim.
Whether you know it or not, everyone knows it.	Sen ýa-da ýok, muny hemmeler bilýär.
I gave it all	Men hemmesini berdim
Someone is coming back.	Kimdir biri gaýdyp gelýär.
Life is hard.	Bütin durmuş kyn.
This is absolutely necessary.	Bu düýbünden zerur.
He says a lot.	Köp zat aýdýar.
I heard what happened to you	Saňa näme bolandygyny eşitdim
I am no longer myself.	Men indi özüm däl.
I want to be with you	Men seniň bilen bolmak isleýärin

Of course I did, but it seemed good.	Elbetde boldum, ýöne ol gowy ýalydy.

That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, gaty çynlakaý mesele bar.
It doesn't seem to be interesting to me.	Bu meniň üçin gyzykly ýaly däl.
I don't know any other way.	Başga ýol bilemok.
I knew he could see me	Meni görüp biljekdigini bilýärdim
How can we make this interesting?	Muny nädip gyzykly edip bileris?
He asked for help.	Kömek sorady.
I had to let you know	Men size habar bermeli boldum
Had a great weekend.	Dynç güni ajaýyp dynç aldy.
I have always been	Men hem hemişe boldum
It was for me.	Bu meniň üçin boldy.
I never saw him like that.	Men onuň ýaly görmedim.
I didn't know how long it had been there	Ol ýerde näçe wagt bolandygyny bilmedim
Today	Bu gün.
This is the correct answer.	Bu dogry jogap.
I think it will be good.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gowy bolar.
I can only talk about them	Men diňe olar hakda gürläp bilerin
I didn't want to talk to him anymore	Indi onuň bilen gürleşmek islemedim
I could tell her to go home.	Men oňa öýe gitmegi aýdyp bilýärdim.
That is not the case.	Ol mesele däl.
I just know that very well	Men diňe gaty gowy bilýärin
I said something big would be needed	Uly bir zadyň gerek boljakdygyny aýtdym
There is no way now.	Indi bir ýol ýok.
This is a really difficult decision.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn karar.
It wasn't that hard to do.	Muny etmek beýle bir kyn däldi.
It was then that an idea came to him	Şol wagt oňa bir pikir geldi
I think that's a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
Not a man.	Bir adam däl.
I can still help him.	Men henizem oňa kömek edip bilerin.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolar.
I didn't see anything else.	Başga zat görmedim.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I have never seen him want such a thing.	Men onuň beýle bir zat isleýändigini hiç wagt görmedim.
No big deal.	Uly mesele ýok.
They are very fast.	Olar gaty çalt.
I want to go with them	Men olar bilen gitmek isleýärin
He was not ready.	Ol taýyn däldi.
I can't say it yet	Men entek muny aýdyp biljek däl
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there. "	Bu bir iş "-diýdi.
He couldn't do it at the time.	Şol wagt edip bilmedi.
So it is.	Şonuň üçin şeýle.
It would be better elsewhere.	Başga bir ýerde has gowy bolardy.
I can see for myself	Men özüm görüp bilýärin
You have to do that	Muny etmeli
He will take care of you.	Ol saňa alada eder.
I was never crazy.	Men hiç haçan däli däldim.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmek hökman däl.
I've had a few.	Mende birnäçe boldy.
I am not alone.	Men ýeke däl.
I was no longer that person	Men indi ol adam däldim
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
How nice it would be!?.	Bu nähili gowy bolardy!?.
This is not the only case.	Bu diňe bir däl.
Tell me what happened.	Näme bolandygyny aýdyň.
There is a lot of hard work for me	Meniň üçin gaty kyn iş bar
I didn't even know it existed	Munuň bardygyny hatda bilmeýärdim
He is not stupid.	Ol samsyk däl.
A month from now is not good for me	Mundan beýläk bir aý meniň üçin gowy däl
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu gaty ähtimal däl ýaly.
Whatever is here.	Bu ýerde näme bar bolsa.
He will.	Ol eder.
And then.	Soň bolsa.
I don't like it at all	Men muny asla halamok

She must be a girl.	Gaty gyz bolmaly.

Tell me where it will be.	Nirede boljakdygyny aýdyň.
How good it is!	Bu nähili gowy!
I knew there was more to it.	Has köp zadyň bardygyny bilýärdim.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
I am the only one.	Men diňe bir.
We need more.	Bize has köp zat gerek.
Here is some money	Ine birnäçe pul
We are no longer two people, but one man.	Biz indi iki adam däl, bir adam.
There is a reason for this.	Ine, munuň bir sebäbi bar.
Very good guy	Gaty gowy ýigit.
Actually the same thing.	Aslynda şol bir zat.
Not you and me	Sen we men däl.

I knew nothing about him.	Men ol hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
She looks great.	Ol gaty ajaýyp görünýär.
OK! 	Bolýar!
There is still nothing there.	Ol ýerde henizem hiç zat ýok.
I can't see it right	Men ony dogry görüp bilemok
And now he has done it again.	Indi bolsa muny ýene etdi.
I was very worried	Men gaty alada etdim
No for an answer	Jogap üçin ýok
Of course not every time.	Elbetde her gezek däl.
Time may be running out.	Wagt ýok bolmagy mümkin.
I'm older now	Men indi uly
I can't do that to him this time	Men bu gezek oňa muny edip bilemok
He almost did.	Ol diýen ýaly etdi.
Who knows what this will be.	Munuň näme boljakdygyny kim bilýär.
I didn't know it at the time, but it happened.	Men şol wagt bilmedim, ýöne şeýle boldy.
We can't be	Biz bolup bilmeris
In fact, they are here.	Aslynda, olar edil şu ýerde.
Not a good thing.	Gowy zat däl.
I am smart	Men akylly
Of course, they are not serious.	Elbetde, olar çynlakaý däl.

It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
It could be me.	Bu men bolup bilerin.
I don't know how.	Nädip çynlakaý bilemok.
I didn’t want to make a decision.	Men karar bermek islemedim.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
He told me he had.	Ol maňa bardygyny aýtdy.
You really are	Siz hakykatdanam
It would be great to know what happened to him	Oňa näme bolandygyny bilmek gaty gowy bolardy
It can't be.	Bolup bilmez.
It can't really be bad.	Aslynda erbet bolup bilmez.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Dogry işi ýokdy.
He wanted to go.	Ol gitmek isledi.
I just want to go, go, go	Diňe gitmek, gitmek, gitmek isleýärin

He stayed there for two weeks.	Ol ol ýerde iki hepde galdy.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
He came to her with attention.	Ol oňa üns bilen geldi.
No songs this time.	Bu gezek aýdym ýok.
This is where it happens.	Ine, şu ýerde bolýar.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
This has not been the case for years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri beýle zat ýokdy.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Nähili ajaýyp iş bolmaly.
Money is money.	Pul - bu pul.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Today	Bu gün.
I'm still there	Men henizem şol ýerde
What a stupid question to ask.	Näme samsyk sorag bermeli.
I can't be here with you	Men bu ýerde siziň bilen bolup bilemok
I doubt he can do anything	Her zady edip biljekdigine şübhelenýärin
You are really interesting.	Siz hakykatdanam gaty gyzykly.
It takes time.	Munuň üçin wagt gerek.
Just a tip.	Diňe bir maslahat.
This is likely to be the case.	Munuň şeýle bolmagy ähtimal.
I think that's possible	Bu mümkin diýip pikir edýärin
I really don't think so.	Men hakykatdanam pikir etmeýärin.
I didn't have a chance	Mende mümkinçilik ýokdy
I didn't have a chance.	Mende mümkinçilik ýokdy.
It was really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty kyn boldy.
There is a good reason for this.	Munuň üçin gowy sebäp bar.
I could not return home	Men ol öýe gaýdyp bilmedim
No more.	Indi ýok.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
One week if needed	Gerek bolsa bir hepde
We will need help.	Bize kömek gerek bolar.
I have to go and get help	Men gidip, kömek almaly
I need something from you	Maňa senden bir zat gerek
I gave him everything	Men oňa hemme zady berdim
I thought it was easy enough	Bu ýeterlik aňsat diýip pikir etdim
Everyone wants to say something.	Her kim öz zadyny aýtmak isleýär.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
He had no time.	Onuň wagty ýokdy.
That's right.	Dogry bar.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
I can't tell you anything else	Men saňa başga zat aýdyp biljek däl
I think he knows what to do	Meniň pikirimçe, ol näme etmelidigini biler
How can he?	Nädip biler?
I have done this several times	Men muny birnäçe gezek etdim
It just seemed right.	Edil dogry zat ýalydy.
I know this will be a little strange	Munuň birneme geň boljakdygyny bilýärin
I did a good job there.	Men ol ýerde gowy iş etdim.
I hope you can help me with something	Maňa bir zat bilen kömek edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt etdim
If bad.	Erbet bolsa.
I have to say it was good	Munuň gowy bolandygyny aýtmaly
I called him.	Men oňa jaň etdim.
I shouldn't have been here	Men bu ýerde bolmaly däldim
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He will be happy and help you.	Ol bagtly bolar we size kömek eder.
And then it was bad for a few weeks.	Soň bolsa birnäçe hepde erbet boldy.
Because he knows.	Sebäbi ol bilýär.
I didn't want to be taken seriously	Çynlakaý gürleşmek islemedim
I think we can do that	Muny edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin
Looks new !.	Täze ýaly görünýär !.
He told me what to do.	Ol maňa näme etmelidigimi aýtdy.
In your opinion, it is very good.	Siziň pikiriňizçe, ol gaty gowy.
I am in a very happy place right now	Men şu wagt gaty bagtly ýerde boldum
I don't do that	Men muny etmeýärin
No need to buy.	Satyn almak hökman däl.
Oh, something else.	Aý, başga bir zat.
They are not smart.	Olar akylly däl.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
He always knows everything.	Ol hemme zady hemişe bilýär.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
They are in the last place.	Olar soňky ýerde.
Not just me.	Diňe maňa däl.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
I was stupid to say that	Muny aýtmak samsyk boldum
I did not know immediately	Men derrew bilmedim
I wasn't going to do much today	Bu gün kän bir iş etjek däldim
I thought it would be interesting to know.	Muny bilmek gyzykly bolar diýip pikir etdim.
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şeýle boldy.
I could not try one	Birini synap görüp bilmedim
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
He thought it would not happen.	Ol beýle bolmaz diýip pikir etdi.
It never seemed to be enough.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik däl ýalydy.
I can only enjoy it.	Men diňe lezzet alyp bilerin.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
I want to do something else	Başga bir zat etmek isleýärin
Only if he knows what to do to help her.	Diňe oňa kömek etmek üçin näme etmelidigini bilýän bolsa.
I never did.	Men hiç haçan etmedim.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
I didn't have that opportunity	Mende beýle mümkinçilik ýokdy
I think this will be good for you	Bu siziň üçin gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I thought it was weird	Bu geň zat diýip pikir etdim
You are not me	Sen men däl '
It didn't hurt me anymore.	Indi maňa zyýan bermedi.
A lot of things here	Bu ýerde köp zatlar
I shouldn't be here	Men bu ýerde bolmaly däl
I hoped not for three years	Üç ýyl däl diýip umyt etdim
I was everything and everyone.	Men hemme zat we hemmeler boldum.
I really have to go home.	Men hakykatdanam öýe gitmeli.
Of course, it's hard for them.	Elbetde, olar üçin kyn.
I think there is more to it	Meniň pikirimçe, mundan has kän
I don't like you like you do.	Men seni seniň ýaly halamok.
I just have to go.	Men diňe gitmeli.
This is not the case.	Bu edil beýle däl.
This is not very interesting yet.	Bu henizem gaty gyzykly däl.
This is who we are.	Bu biz kim.
I'm worried.	Men alada edýärin.
Of course I will	Elbetde ederin
I can get another job	Başga iş alyp bilerin
He went somewhere.	Bir ýere gitdi.
I told you about it	Men ol hakda size aýtdym
Last but not least.	Iň soňky.
I didn't know what happened to me	Mende näme bolandygyny bilmedim
It will be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolar.
I know he can sing	Aýdym aýdyp biljekdigini bilýärin
I was there for three days.	Men ol ýerde üç gün boldum.
I can't do anything	Men hiç zat edip bilemok
What happened to him.	Ol näme boldy.
I think it did a great job	Bu gaty gowy iş etdi diýip pikir edýärin
Good.	Gowy.
I didn't want to.	Men ýene islemedim.
It seemed like a lot.	Bu gaty köp ýalydy.
It's actually worse.	Aslynda has erbet.
I thought you could say that	Muny aýdyp bilersiňiz öýdüpdim
I can't even help you	Men hatda size kömek edip bilemok
A completely new person in your opinion	Siziň pikiriňizçe düýbünden täze adam
I didn't want to be	Men bolmak islemedim
He apologized.	Ol ötünç sorady.
You won't be better.	Sen has gowy bolmaz.
Everything looks great here.	Bu ýerde hemme zat ajaýyp görünýär.
I saw it myself	Men muny özüm gördüm
I know this makes him very anxious.	Munuň ony gaty biynjalyk edýändigini bilýärin.
He did not say.	Ol aýtmady.
I couldn't stop thinking about him	Men ol hakda pikir etmegi bes edip bilmedim
In fact, it looks better.	Aslynda bu has gowy görünýär.
Nothing will happen to you here.	Bu ýerde size hiç zat bolmaz.
Something happened to him.	Oňa bir zat boldy.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
Just do it!	Diňe et!
Of course you can.	Elbetde edip bilersiňiz.
And then to me. 	Soň bolsa maňa. 
This is not what it should be.	Bu bolmaly zat däl.
It could be close.	Bu ýakyn bolup biler.
I do not agree with that.	Men muňa razy däl.
It was hard.	Ol kyn boldy.
More	Has köp.
I'm not against it.	Oňa garşy däl.
That's it.	Ine, şeýle.
I should never have given up	Men hiç haçan bermeli däldim
He had been there for two days.	Ol iki gün bäri bardy.
I didn't want to go	Men gitmek islemedim
I didn't need another girl.	Maňa başga gyz gerek däldi.
It always seemed so stupid.	Elmydama şeýle samsyk ýalydy.
I thought about the future	Geljek hakda pikir etdim
I was busy	Men iş bilen meşgul boldum
I shouldn’t have been happier anymore	Men mundan beýläk bagtly bolmaly däldim
He is not.	Ol beýle däl.
This is good for them.	Bu olar üçin gowy.
I didn’t really know how to do it.	Aslynda muny nädip etmelidigini bilmedim.
It doesn't have to be much.	Kän bir zat bolmaly däl.
I just want to talk to you	Men diňe siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
Who we are.	Biz kim.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
You don't have to tell him much.	Oňa kän zat aýtmak hökman däl.
I saw.	Men gördüm.
No one knows, that's just the way it is.	Hiç kim bilenok, diňe şeýle bolýar.
I want the right fun	Dogry hezil isleýärin
Good.	Gowy.
I can't do it anymore	Indi edip bilemok
It comes every night.	Her gije gelýär.
Anyone can do that.	Her kim muny edip biler.
Every day is a new day.	Her gün täze gün.
And then I heard it again.	Soň bolsa ýene eşitdim.
It's been a few days.	Birnäçe gün boldy.
I haven't seen it in two years	Iki ýyl bäri görmedim
I couldn't think of them	Men olar hakda pikir edip bilmedim
I was not happy	Men bagtly däldim
I don’t know why he doesn’t.	Näme üçin beýle etmeýändigini bilemok.
About it.	Bu hakda.
Because that's exactly what happened.	Sebäbi hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
I think this is really necessary	Bu hakykatdanam zerur diýip pikir edýärin
Good guy	Gowy ýigit.
How true it is.	Ol nähili dogry.
All I can do now is buy time.	Häzirki wagtda edip biljek zady, wagt satyn almak.
I have so much.	Mende gaty köp zat bar.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
Only visible to you.	Diňe size görünýär.
I knew he wasn't ready	Men onuň taýyn däldigini bilýärdim
I think about it every day.	Men ol hakda her gün pikir edýärin.
It's easier.	Bu has aňsat.
He did not want to leave.	Ol gitmek islemedi.
Not for a week.	Bir hepde däl.
So it should be an interesting day.	Şonuň üçin gyzykly gün bolmaly.
He doesn't need it.	Oňa mätäç däl.
No one was there.	Hiç kim hiç kim däldi.
I don't like it like you do.	Men muny seniň ýaly halamok.
That was no longer the case.	Indi beýle däldi.
I am a new person	Men täze adam boldum
In fact, I did very well	Aslynda gaty gowy etdim
And then he asked.	Soň bolsa sorady.
If you need anything else, say so.	Başga bir zat gerek bolsa, aýdyň.
Three years.	Üç ýyl.
I was like a young girl again	Men ýene ýaş gyz ýaly boldum
I don't trust you anymore	Indi saňa ynanamok
It's good to talk to you.	Siziň bilen gürleşmek gowy.
No one knows what this will be like.	Munuň nähili boljakdygyny hiç kim bilenok.
Will definitely be back again.	Elbetde ýene gaýdyp geler.
It could be somewhere now.	Ol häzir bir ýerde bolup biler.
I just heard it.	Men muny diňe eşitdim.
I have never been so happy	Men beýle bagtly bolup görmedim
I didn’t see it with his work	Men onuň işi bilen görmedim
That doesn't seem to be the case now.	Häzir beýle däl ýaly.
I couldn't say anything else	Başga zat aýdyp bilmedim
For me and you	Meniň we seniň üçin.
It was really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn boldy.
This is not difficult.	Bu kyn däl.
There are only a few hours left for this.	Munuň üçin diňe birnäçe sagat galdy.
I have a few questions	Mende birnäçe sorag bar
The answer is we don’t need it.	Jogap, bize zerur däl.
I want to do that	Men muny etmek isleýärin
He did it, but it didn't help me.	Ol muny etdi, ýöne maňa kömek etmedi.
I didn't see what happened	Näme bolandygyny görmedim
As if he did.	Şeýle eden ýaly.
I couldn't tell anymore.	Indi aýdyp bilmedim.
Like this	Munuň ýaly.
I told her it wasn't good	Men oňa gowy däldigini aýtdym
I am no longer myself	Men indi özüm däl
There is really nothing new.	Hakykatdanam, täze zat ýok.
This is happening everywhere.	Bu hemme ýerde bolýar.
I just didn't think so	Diňe beýle pikir etmedim
I know what happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilýärin.
I had enough this morning	Şu gün irden ýeterlik boldum
I think that's a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
I already knew what he was thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini eýýäm bilýärdim
I can give you the time or the things you need	Size wagt ýa-da zerur zatlary berip bilerin
Needless to say, but so be it	Muny aýtmaly däl, ýöne şeýle
It's really big.	Bu hakykatdanam uly.
I didn't, but only	Etmedim, ýöne diňe
You don't really need much.	Size hakykatdanam kän zat gerek däl.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
I don’t think there’s much he can say about that	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hakda onuň aýdyp biljek zady kän däl
Something seemed to be against me this morning.	Şu gün irden bir zat maňa garşy ýalydy.
I think he did a great job	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gaty gowy iş etdi
No one else can do that.	Muny başga hiç kim edip bilmez.
This is the best book to worry about.	Bu alada barada iň gowy kitap.
What am I doing	Men näme edýärin
With me	Meniň bilen.
I thought it would be good once	Bir gezek gowy bolar öýdüpdim
He was not alone.	Diňe özi däldi.
Now there is only one thing that matters.	Indi munuň diňe bir işi bar.
He wanted her to call him.	Ol özüne jaň etmegini isledi.
Everyone is gone.	Hemmeler gitdi.
I didn't see him this morning	Men ony şu gün irden görmedim
I can't sleep	Men uklap bilemok
I know, it seems like a long way off	Bilýärin, gaty uzak ýaly görünýär
I still can't think of anything	Men henizem hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilemok
I can't, or I haven't.	Edip bilemok, ýa-da entek ýok.
I want to do this for myself	Muny özüm üçin etmek isleýärin
The first girl	Ilkinji gyz
OK, but they were.	Bolýar, ýöne olar bardy.
I can help	Kömek edip bilerin
I still have the opportunity	Mende henizem mümkinçilik bar
It was night.	Gije boldy.
He never had to.	Ol hiç haçan hökman däldi.
This is just a human being.	Bu diňe adam.
This is difficult.	Bu kyn.
There were two reasons.	Iki sebäp bardy.
I was with you yesterday	Düýn seniň bilen boldum
It's easy for a person to talk.	Adam üçin gürleşmek aňsat.
I got such a good idea	Şeýle gowy pikir aldym
I tried everything.	Men hemme zady synap gördüm.
I really have to go	Men hakykatdanam gitmeli
I want to think it will be good	Gowy bolar diýip pikir etmek isleýärin
I was alone again	Men ýene ýeke boldum
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şeýle zerur.
Serious call	Çynlakaý jaň
This was not new.	Bu täze däldi.
So you have to make the right decision.	Şonuň üçin dogry karar bermeli.
I want to help her	Men oňa kömek etmek isleýärin
It happened.	Ol boldy.
I think this is great.	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir edýärin.
It's easy to do that.	Muny etmek aňsat.
I knew it wasn't going to happen	Munuň bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärdim
Of course, this is a close question.	Elbetde, bu ýakyn sorag.
He is always his own.	Elmydama onuň özi.
I was stupid	Men samsyk boldum
I can't see what it will do	Munuň näme etjekdigini görüp bilemok
I don't need that.	Munuň üçin maňa gerek däl.
I can go for a while	Biraz wagt gidip bilerin
No wonder there.	Ol ýerde geň zat ýok.
It's very difficult now.	Indi gaty kyn.
I did nothing	Men hiç zat etmedim
Not all the time.	Bütin wagt däl.
He said it was not.	Ol beýle däldigini aýtdy.
He wanted to talk to me.	Ol meniň bilen gürleşmek isledi.
It was fun.	Gyzykly boldy.
If not.	Däl bolsa.
Oh, that wasn't good.	Aý, bu gowy däldi.
I doubt he will ever	Onuň hiç haçan etjekdigine şübhelenýärin
I couldn't see anymore	Indi görüp bilmedim
He actually said that.	Aslynda muny aýtdy.
I know what he wants	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärin
I didn't think much of it at the time	Men şol wagt kän pikir etmedim
There is nothing against you.	Saňa garşy hiç zat ýok.
There must be someone else.	Başga bir adam bolmaly.
He still does.	Ol henizem edýär.
This is really crazy.	Bu hakykatdanam däli.
He was not, he was not.	Ol beýle däldi, indi däldi.
He did not call her.	Ol oňa jaň etmedi.
I was not good for him.	Men onuň üçin gowy däldim.
I tried it and it was great	Synap gördüm, gaty gowy boldy
These are really two.	Bu hakykatdanam ikisi.
Now the good news.	Indi gowy habar.
In the evening the young man came.	Agşam ýigit geldi.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I didn't know what he wanted	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilmedim
I think it will be next year for him	Onuň üçin indiki ýyl bolar diýip pikir edýärin
He is not here.	Ol bu ýerde däl.
This fool did it.	Bu samsyk muny etdi.
I'm not against it.	Men muňa garşy däl.
That's right.	Ol dogry.
In fact, it was a very easy task.	Aslynda bu gaty aňsat iş boldy.
I know he really wants to see you	Onuň hakykatdanam seni görmek isleýändigini bilýärin
The same answer.	Şol bir jogap.
It seems impossible.	Mümkin däl ýaly.
All I have to do is leave	Meniň etmeli bir zadym galdy
I can't say that	Men muny aýdyp biljek däl
He doesn't need it.	Oňa mätäç däl.
Very loud	Gaty ses.
Then he returned to work.	Soň bolsa işe gaýdyp geldi.
This was not true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry däldi.
It was an interesting day.	Bu gyzykly gün boldy.
No one paid attention.	Hiç kim üns bermedi.
So it will be fast.	Şonuň üçin bu çalt bolar.
This seems impossible.	Bu mümkin däl ýaly.
Easy.	Aňsat.
I tried to call him yesterday	Düýn oňa jaň etjek boldum
You don't have to.	Şeýle hem etmeli däl.
They are beautiful and even more beautiful.	Olar ajaýyp, hatda has ajaýyp.
I heard it very well	Men ony gaty gowy eşitdim
You have to worry about that.	Bu barada alada etmeli.
I just thought about it.	Men bu hakda diňe pikir etdim.
I tried.	Men synap gördüm.
I think she looks beautiful	Meniň pikirimçe, ol owadan görünýär
I thought about it	Men bu barada pikir etdim
I can't sleep	Men uklap bilemok
Strange, he thought.	Geň, diýip pikir etdi.
This seems to be true for me.	Bu edil meniň üçin dogry ýaly.
Maybe not	Belki beýle bolmaz
He has already said a lot.	Ol eýýäm gaty köp zat aýtdy.
I did it.	Men ony etdim.
This was not very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal däldi.
I saw it once.	Men ony bir gezek gördüm.
I didn't care about anyone but you	Senden başga hiç kime alada etmedim
Not much here.	Bu ýerde kän däl.
Of course, I have never seen anything like it	Elbetde, munuň ýaly zady görmedim
Police arrived.	Polisiýa geldi.
You had a chance.	Size bir mümkinçilik boldy.
I want to help you	Size kömek etmek isleýärin
This will drive you crazy.	Bu sizi däli eder.
He is no longer for me.	Ol indi meniň üçin däl.
If anyone knows.	Kimdir biri bilýän bolsa.
And he wanted to be there.	We ol ýerde bolmak isledi.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He never wanted to get it.	Ol muny hiç haçan almak islemedi.
I think he took me home.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol meni öýüne alyp gitdi.
I'll do it tonight.	Şu gije ederin.
He told her he had called.	Oňa jaň edendigini aýtdy.
The girl thought how beautiful she was.	Gyz nähili owadan diýip pikir etdi.
I didn't think about it	Men bu hakda näme pikir etmedim
More	Has köp.
And now he's doing it for us.	Indi bolsa ol muny bize edýär.
I think there is a job here	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýerde bir iş bar
I had never seen him before.	Men ony öň görmedim.
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
This has only happened once.	Bu diňe bir gezek boldy.
Of course, the police did not think so.	Elbetde, polisiýa beýle pikir etmedi.
I really need it now	Maňa hakykatdanam şu wagt gerek
I think this is a wise decision.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu akylly karar.
He knew he was there.	Ol özüniň bardygyny bilýärdi.
Good.	Gowy.
I saw everything	Men hemme zady gördüm
I never wanted to hurt you.	Men hiç haçan saňa zyýan bermek islemedim.
I really like it.	Bu hakykatdanam halaýar.
I'm not for that money.	Men bu pul üçin däl.
I think you need it	Meniň pikirimçe, ol size gerek
It was kind of good.	Bu bir hili gowy boldy.
Here we are.	Ine, biz şol ýerde.
I trust you	Men saňa ynanýaryn.
I think that's the problem now	Meniň pikirimçe, bu indi mesele
It should be fun.	Aslynda gyzykly bolmaly.
How to be	Nädip bolmaly.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I can't see who is doing it	Kimiň edýändigini görüp bilemok
There is a lot of hope there.	Ol ýerde köp umyt bar.
I was not as happy as you	Men seniň ýaly bagtly däldim
This is from me.	Bu menden.
I hoped it would not be against it	Muňa garşy bolmaz diýip umyt etdim
You are here	Siz şu ýerde
I think that word came out about me.	Bu söz meniň hakda çykdy öýdýän.
All day, no.	Bütin gün, ýok.
I always do that	Men muny hemişe edýärin
Nothing can be easier.	Hiç zat aňsat bolup bilmez.
It takes several years.	Birnäçe ýyl gerek.
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa ýol bermedi.
Now this is just a mistake.	Indi bu diňe bir ýalňyşlyk.
Just like him.	Edil edil özi ýaly.
This is indeed the case.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle.
I will never do that	Men muny hiç haçan etjek däl
I think a lot of people will do that	Meniň pikirimçe, köp adam şeýle eder
I want to be good with him	Men onuň bilen gowy bolmak isleýärin
I was no more.	Men indi däldim.
I have to go somewhere	Men bir ýere gitmeli
I need more.	Maňa has köp zat gerek.
Here is the problem.	Ine, mesele.
How is that	Bu nähili?
It may also be extinct.	Şeýle hem ýok bolmagy mümkin.
I'm sorry, but so be it.	Bagyşlaň, ýöne şeýle.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
I still have hope for him	Meniň pikirimçe, oňa henizem umyt bar
This year.	Bu ýyl.
It was completely obeyed.	Bu düýbünden boýun boldy.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolardy.
He had only one thing.	Onuň diňe ýekeje zady bardy.
There could be more.	Has köp zat bolup biler.
This is not a man.	Bu adam däl.
I want to talk to you	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
I don’t know if it happened or not.	Onuň bolandygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny bilemok.
This is already very bad.	Bu eýýäm gaty erbet.
You can always get another job.	Elmydama başga bir iş alyp bilersiňiz.
I did nothing.	Men hiç zat etmedim.
I knew nothing about it	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
That morning.	Şol gün irden.
I knew it for the first time	Men ilkinji gezek bilýärdim
This is not much.	Bu kän däl.
An idea came to him.	Oňa bir pikir geldi.
Of course there was.	Elbetde bardy.
No one paid attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa üns bermedi.
That should be good.	Bu gowy bolmaly.
I can't help you anymore.	Indi saňa kömek edip bilemok.
I knew it by heart.	Men muny ýatdan bilýärdim.
In fact, it will not be so difficult.	Aslynda beýle kyn bolmaz.
I have to be there	Men ol ýerde bolmaly
Every now and then for the next month.	Indi we indiki aý üçin her gün.
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
He said I was not alone	Men ýeke däldim diýdi
Very good for us.	Biziň üçin gaty gowy.
Who or what.	Kim ýa-da näme bolsa.
I knew nothing	Men hiç zat bilmeýärdim
I had nothing else.	Menden başga zat ýokdy.
I thought it was just you	Diňe sen bolmaly diýip pikir etdim
Always a man.	Elmydama adam.
I don't need it anywhere else.	Maňa başga ýerde gerek däl.
There was nothing to worry about.	Alada etmeli zat ýokdy.
He no longer wanted to think about it.	Ol indi bu barada pikir etmek islemedi.
Of course I still do.	Elbetde, henizem edýärin.
He never needed a job	Oňa asla iş gerek däldi
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I haven't seen you all day	Men seni bütin gün görmedim
Maybe there’s a lot there.	Belki, ol ýerde gaty köp zat bar.
It seemed great.	Ajaýyp ýalydy.
I could never do it.	Hiç haçan edip bilmedim.
There was so much I didn't know.	Entek bilmeýän gaty köp zat bardy.
He knew something else.	Ol başga bir zady bilýärdi.
You are here	Sen şu ýerde
Every day, every night and every hour.	Her gün, her gije we her sagat.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilenok.
I can't see a bad thing here	Men bu ýerde bir erbet zady görüp bilemok
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
This is a problem for me.	Bu meniň üçin bir mesele.
He did nothing.	Ol hiç zat etmedi.
Of course it is.	Elbetde, şeýle.
Actually a few hours.	Aslynda birnäçe sagat.
You are for me.	Meniň üçin sen.
It was his day.	Bu onuň güni boldy.
It will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek.
I really do.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle edýärin.
I don't care about them as much as I do.	Men olar üçin edil meniň ýaly alada etmeýärin.
He did it to me.	Ol maňa etdi.
I do not agree with you	Men senden razy däl
Does he know about it or not?	Bu hakda bilýärmi ýa dälmi?
I don't think that would be a good idea.	Bu gaty gowy pikir bolmaz öýdemok.
I could not see anything	Men hiç zat görüp bilmedim
I need time for myself	Maňa özüm üçin wagt gerek
Good question	Gowy sorag
I just want to be.	Men diňe bolmak isleýärin.
I can't do it anymore	Indi edip bilemok
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
I really believe that	Men muňa hakykatdanam ynanýaryn
I couldn't do anything else	Başga bir zat edip bilmedim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şol bir zat.
She is very difficult, but she is smart.	Ol gaty kyn, ýöne akylly.
Then there is the sound.	Soň bolsa ses ýok.
Then comes the sound.	Soň bolsa ses gelýär.
I know he did it, but never again.	Munuň bu işi edendigini bilýärin, ýöne indi hiç haçan.
I'm so scared.	Men gaty gorkýaryn.
I got a good idea about it	Men bu barada gowy pikir aldym
It seems right to me, but it doesn't seem to be.	Maňa dogry görünýär, ýöne beýle däl ýaly.
I still think about it every day.	Men henizem bu hakda her gün pikir edýärin.
There is something there.	Ol ýerde bir zat bar.
Maybe I should just go	Belki, men diňe gitmeli
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
It's very difficult.	Ol gaty kyn.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýok.
And then the next one.	Soň bolsa indiki.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
Long, long ago.	Uzak, öň.
Something else is there.	Ol ýerde başga zat.
Everything will be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolar.
I couldn't see what he was doing	Men onuň näme edenini görüp bilmedim
I'm not home yet	Men entek öýde däl
He calls me saying that everything will be fine.	Hemme zadyň gowy boljakdygyny aýdyp, maňa jaň edýär.
No one is good.	Hiç kim gowy däl.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
That made him happy.	Bu ony bagtly etdi.
Not much this time.	Bu gezek kän däl.
I haven't been here for many years	Men bu ýerde köp ýyl bäri ýok
The problem is not enough.	Mesele ýeterlik däl.
He said no.	Ol ýok diýdi.
And then he came back with that song.	Soň bolsa şol aýdym bilen gaýdyp geldi.
I have never been able to do the right thing	Men hiç wagt dogry zat edip bilmedim
A month or a month.	Bir aý ýa-da bir aý.
This time he came alone.	Bu gezek ol ýeke geldi.
Almost literally.	Bu söz bilen diýen ýaly.
I think the time is right	Wagty dogry diýip pikir edýärin
Are you like that	Sen şeýlemi?
This time, I didn't have to say that	Bu gezek hem muny aýtmaly däldim
A few issues.	Birnäçe mesele.
I couldn't see it.	Men ony görüp bilmedim.
Not a good song.	Gowy aýdym däl.
I need help	Kömek gerek
I'm so sorry for them	Men olar üçin gaty gynanýaryn
This is certainly true.	Bu, elbetde, dogry.
What's the matter?	Mesele näme?
I've been here a lot.	Men bu ýerde köp boldum.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
I can't promise it will happen either.	Munuň hem boljakdygyna söz berip bilemok.
He did his best.	Ol iň gowy zatlary etdi.
You and the girl.	Sen we gyz.
I know this can happen	Munuň bolup biljekdigini bilýärin
I never thought this would help me so much	Munuň maňa köp kömek etjekdigini asla pikir etmedim
And then he knew nothing.	Soň bolsa hiç zat bilmedi.
That person will not be mine.	Ol adam meniň bolmaz.
Then another.	Soň başga biri.
No sound.	Ses ýok.
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
I care about them.	Men olar hakda alada edýärin.
I can tell him the truth too	Men oňa hakykaty hem aýdyp bilerin
Nothing more.	Mundan başga hiç zat ýok.
There will be no other option now.	Indi başga bir mümkinçilik bolmaz.
Good.	Gowy.
Oh, the sound.	Aý, ses.
Now or forever.	Indi ýa-da hemişe.
This can be a good and bad thing.	Bu gowy we erbet zat bolup biler.
I was alone at home	Men öýde ýeke boldum
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
We need to help him.	Biz oňa kömek etmeli.
I'm really good	Men hakykatdanam gowy
More than that.	Has köp zat.
A little too good, I think	Biraz gaty gowy, meniň pikirimçe
I have seen and heard many things	Men köp zady gördüm we eşitdim
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
No one told me.	Hiç kim maňa aýtmady.
I think there are many things.	Meniň pikirimçe, köp zatlar bar.
He already knew that.	Ol muny eýýäm bilýärdi.
Those three words.	Şol üç söz.
I am not.	Men beýle däl.
It even makes us.	Bizi hatda edýär.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
Because it was so new.	Sebäbi gaty täze boldy.
I will never be at home with myself.	Men hiç wagt özüm bilen öýde bolmaz.
It should be.	Bu bolmaly.
This is not a big deal for me.	Bu meniň üçin uly bir zat däl.
I want to be with him	Men onuň bilen bile bolmak isleýärin
There is no possibility for that.	Munuň üçin mümkinçilik ýok.
He does too.	Ol hem edýär.
I already know about those two	Men ol ikisi hakda eýýäm bilýärin
If there is one thing, he needs more.	Bir zat bar bolsa, oňa has köp zat gerek.
I can always take care of you	Men elmydama siziň hakda alada edip bilerin
I will have to make a lot of decisions.	Köp karar bermeli bolaryn.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
He must have seen me.	Ol meni gören bolsa gerek.
It was fast.	Bu çalt boldy.
These are wonderful things.	Bu ajaýyp zatlar.
He asked me for something.	Ol menden bir zat isledi.
He does the right thing.	Dogry edýär.
It will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
I got a little weird answer.	Biraz geň jogap aldym.
I thought this was the right thing to do	Muny dogry zat diýip pikir etdim
He said it was not.	Ol beýle däl diýdi.
I called him.	Men oňa jaň etdim.
Not everything can happen.	Hemme zat bolup bilmez.
There were two people.	Iki adam bardy.
I know better	Men has gowy bilýärin
That should be sufficient enough for us.	Bu biziň üçin ýeterlik bolmaly.
Okay, one day.	Bolýar, bir gün.
It's over.	Bu indi.
Other than me.	Menden başga.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
I was not alone all night	Men bütin gije ýeke däldim
I want to be right	Dogry etmek isleýärin
No news is good news.	Hiç hili habar gowy habar däl.
Because it is.	Sebäbi şeýle.
What are we.	Biz näme.
The answer, of course, is yes.	Jogap, elbetde edip biler.
He said that every day.	Ol her gün şeýle diýdi.
In fact, I didn't need her to do that	Aslynda onuň muny etmegine mätäç däldim
I shouldn’t have hurt him	Men oňa zyýan bermeli däldim
I can't think of anyone who can do it better.	Ony has gowy edip biljek adam hakda pikir edip bilemok.
In fact, it was not necessarily tonight.	Aslynda bu agşam hökman däldi.
No one told me about it	Bu hakda hiç kim maňa aýtmady
I thought about it twice	Men bu barada iki gezek pikir etdim
That's what happens.	Ine, şeýle bolýar.
He thought he wanted to go home	Öýe gitmek isleýärin, diýip pikir etdi
He only did it twice	Diňe iki gezek etdi
I think that's a difficult question, too	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hem kyn sorag
I can be happy tonight	Şu gije bagtly bolup bilerin
I saw this happen.	Munuň bolandygyny gördüm.
I'm not into it	Men oňa däl
I was never alone with him	Men onuň bilen hiç haçan ýeke däldim
It did.	Bu etdi.
Now we.	Indi biz.
Bad, bad, bad.	Erbet, erbet, erbet.
Now he can do it for you too !.	Indi ol hem siziň üçin edip biler!.
This word	Bu söz.
I must have thought about it.	Men bu barada pikir eden bolmaly.
I can't tell her about it	Men oňa ol hakda aýdyp biljek däl
I just need a little time	Maňa diňe biraz wagt gerek
He didn't know me.	Ol meni bilmeýärdi.
Not bad, this time.	Erbet däl, bu gezek.
That book is such a wonderful book.	Şol kitap şeýle ajaýyp kitap.
He is for himself.	Ol özi üçin.
We have to go.	Biz gitmeli.
It really does happen.	Bu hakykatdanam bolýar.
Every year it destroys me completely.	Her ýyl meni düýbünden ýok edýär.
He did not want to answer.	Ol jogap bermek islemedi.
The more, the better.	Has köp, has gowy bolar.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I think this is a very good idea.	Bu pikir gaty gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin.
I have no money	Mende pul ýok
Yesterday was a weekend.	Düýn dynç güni boldy.
I'm sorry.	Men gynanýaryn.
For good.	Gowy üçin.
I don't know what he thinks	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilemok
It happens so fast.	Şeýle çalt bolýar.
I care about you.	Men saňa alada edýärin.
Of course, I hope it never happens	Elbetde, hiç haçan bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin
I have not been so happy and full for years	Birnäçe ýyl bäri beýle bagtly we doly bolup görmedim
And then he couldn't say anything else.	Soň bolsa başga bir zat aýdyp bilmedi.
Every morning	Her gün irden.
Oh no, that wasn't good.	Aý ýok, bu gowy däldi.
This is the police.	Bu polisiýa.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
Many things.	Köp zatlar.
You can pay attention	Üns berip bilersiňiz
I couldn’t be happier with them	Men olar bilen has bagtly bolup bilmedim
I want to think about it	Bu hakda pikir etmek isleýärin
I asked a question about the case	Iş hakda sorag berdim
No decision is made.	Hiç bir karar karar däl.
I don't know how.	Nädip bilemok.
I can get this somewhere	Men bu zady bir ýere alyp bilerin
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, edil şonuň ýaly.
I don't need that.	Maňa bu gerek däl.
Maybe like one or two.	Belki bir ýa-da iki ýaly.
It's a lot, but it's necessary.	Bu köp, ýöne zerur.
Then there is the sound.	Soň ses däl.
Do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly et.
He is the same.	Ol edil şol bir.
I was still on the ground	Men henizem ýerde boldum
I didn't see it	Men ony görmedim
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
I can't get these things for too much	Bu zatlary gaty köp zat üçin alyp bilemok
You don't have to do anything, you have to go somewhere.	Hiç zat etmeli däl, nirä gitmeli.
Of course, I already knew you	Elbetde, seniň öňem bilýärdim
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
This and that happened to me.	Bu we meniň bilen boldy.
Because there is nothing here.	Sebäbi bu ýerde hiç zat ýok.
I just think about it	Men diňe onuň hakda pikir edýärin
He doesn't have to tell me twice.	Ol maňa iki gezek aýtmaly däl.
I thought it was great	Ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim
He thought it was very close.	Gaty ýakyn, diýip pikir etdi.
It's too early for now.	Häzirki wagtda munuň üçin entek ir.
That could be really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy bolup biler.
I had to give him whatever he wanted	Men oňa islän zadyny bermeli boldum
How good is that	Bu nähili gowy.
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men munuň uly bir zat däldigini aýtdym
In fact, no words will be enough.	Hakykatdanam, hiç bir söz ýeterlik bolmaz.
It's there.	Ol ýerde bar.
Today	Bu gün.
I just want to do everything	Men diňe hemme zady etmek isleýärin
If there is such a thing.	Şeýle zat bar bolsa.
You need money	Size pul gerek
Ma'am.	Bu.
Of course, this is not the case.	Elbetde, bu beýle däl.
There was nothing for him	Onuň üçin hiç zat ýokdy
Right now and right now.	Edil şu wagt we şu wagt.
I did it to make you crazy	Men seni däli etmek üçin etdim
I'm not that good.	Men, beýle gowy däl.
Oh! 	Aý!
Smarter than me	Menden has akylly.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
Really bad news.	Hakykatdanam erbet habar.
I have seen this many times.	Men muny köp gezek gördüm.
This can take several years.	Bu birnäçe ýyl alyp biler.
I was worried.	Men alada etdim.
No one did that.	Hiç kim beýle zady etmedi.
There are actually two reasons.	Aslynda iki sebäp.
This is never a good decision.	Bu hiç haçan gowy karar däl.
So it’s hard for them.	Şonuň üçin olar üçin kyn.
It was the same with him.	Ol hem edil şonuň ýalydy.
I do not want	Men islämok
Not enough hope.	Umyt ýeterlik däl.
I had nothing	Mende hiç zat ýokdy
I'm next	Men indiki
He was kind of surprised.	Ol bir hili geň galdy.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
It just wasn’t right.	Diňe dogry däldi.
And it's not fun.	We gyzykly däl.
I am here.	Men şu ýerde.
I know.	Men bilýärin.
It was a wonderful night.	Bu ajaýyp gije boldy.
I think so	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şeýle
I think that's what happened here	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýerde şeýle boldy
They are so stupid.	Olar gaty samsyk.
Not another word.	Başga söz däl.
Can't be right.	Dogry bolup bilmeýän.
He had to give something somewhere.	Bir ýerde bir zat bermeli boldy.
I make you very, very big	Men sizi gaty uly, uly
We can help.	Biz kömek edip bileris.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
I told her this was not a good idea	Men oňa munuň gowy pikir däldigini aýtdym
I hope it can be	Bolup biler diýip umyt edýärin
Not too fast.	Gaty çalt däl.
It can't be.	Ol bolup bilmez.
It's about money.	Bu pul hakda.
So sorry	Şonuň üçin bagyşlaň.
He always wants to do everything for himself.	Elmydama özi üçin hemme zady etmek isleýär.
Not necessarily.	Mümkin bolmagy hökman däl.
They are needed for me.	Meniň üçin olar zerur.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Mundan beýläk bolmaz diýip umyt etmeli.
I can't think of anyone	Hemmeler üçin pikir edip bilemok
He's gone now.	Ol indi gitdi.
Of course I did.	Elbetde etdim.
It can't hurt him.	Oňa zyýan berip bilmez.
I know he will agree	Onuň razy boljakdygyny bilýärin
In fact, there are many	Aslynda gaty köp zat
He has a lot to do.	Ol köp etmeli.
I called him, but there was no answer.	Men oňa jaň etdim, ýöne jogap ýok.
Call the police	Polisiýa jaň etmek
We need to give more.	Bize has köp zat bermeli.
It will be very fun here.	Ine, bu ýerde gaty hezil eder.
I can't do that right now.	Men muny şu wagt edip bilemok.
Right here.	Edil şu ýerde.
One problem may be time.	Bir mesele wagt bolup biler.
That would always be the case.	Elmydama şeýle bolardy.
I didn't have to call you	Men saňa jaň etmeli däldim
Of course, it will be easier to do.	Elbetde, etmek has aňsat zat bolar.
I still care about him	Men henizem onuň hakda alada edýärin
This is very likely to be the case here.	Bu ýerde şeýle bolmagy gaty ähtimal.
I can't give it to you	Men saňa berip bilemok
Of course, I didn't need to	Elbetde, maňa gerek däldi
I'm crazy about you	Men sen hakda däli
Now I am arresting you	Indi seni tussag edýärin
I couldn't get this job	Men bu işi alyp bilmedim
I hope this will be good with you	Bu siziň bilen gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
A little weird, but not bad	Biraz geň, ýöne erbet däl
I didn’t want to hurt anyone	Men hiç kime zyýan bermek islemedim
I do more now.	Men häzir has köp zat edýärin.
This seems to be a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele ýaly.
That's all you have to do.	Bu seniň etmeli zadyň.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
I can tell completely	Men doly aýdyp bilerin
Everything is against me.	Hemme zat maňa garşy.
He couldn't do much, he made him crazy	Köp zat edip bilmedi, ony däli etdi
I saw about you	Men sen hakda gördüm
Surprisingly, he was not.	Geň, sebäbi ol ýokdy.
A long time ago	Köp wagt mundan ozal
That seemed to help a lot.	Bu bolsa köp kömek eden ýalydy.
This was not the answer.	Bu jogap däldi.
I was no one.	Men düýbünden hiç kim däldim.
I have it at home.	Mende öýde bar.
I have to let him know	Men oňa habar bermeli
This is never the case.	Hiç haçan beýle däl.
A few weeks later.	Birnäçe hepde soň.
A few people came out, but not many	Birnäçe adam çykdy, ýöne kän däl
I never thought it would happen	Men onuň bolandygyny asla pikir etmedim
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolar.
Good, but not enough.	Gowy, ýöne ýeterlik däl.
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Oh no, no! 	Aý ýok, ýok!
please	haýyş edýärin.
"It simply came to our notice then," he said.	Ol: "Bolup biler" -diýdi.
Bad news and probably good news.	Erbet habar we ähtimal gowy habar.
I'm never good enough	Men hiç wagt ýeterlik däl
He likes it too.	Ol hem muny halaýar.
I had to do something fast	Men çalt bir zat etmeli boldum
I couldn't see it that way	Men ony beýle görüp bilmedim
There is no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýok.
I can't think of anything	Men hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilemok
This can be fun.	Bu gyzykly bolup biler.
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men munuň hiç zat däldigini aýtdym
Life is beautiful.	Durmuş owadan.
There will be good problems.	Gowy kynçylyk bolar.
He was right.	Ol dogry aýtdy.
Really big.	Hakykatdanam uly.
That would be the right thing to do.	Bu dogry zat bolardy.
So this is a bit difficult.	Şonuň üçin bu birneme kyn.
He knew it, but he didn't ask questions.	Ol muny bilýärdi, ýöne sorag bermedi.
I'm not home yet	Men henizem öýde däldim
I thought about it again, but not seriously.	Bu hakda ýene pikir etdim, ýöne çynlakaý däl.
A few years ago.	Birnäçe ýyl mundan ozal.
I didn't know what happened to me	Mende näme bolandygyny bilmedim
I think that would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
It was not easy either.	Bu hem aňsat däldi.
Very nice.	Gaty ajaýyp.
It's almost there, ready.	Ol ýerde diýen ýaly, taýyn diýen ýaly bir zat.
Now would be the time to do that.	Indi muny etmegiň wagty bolardy.
It was the same.	Edil şonuň ýalydy.
I must have done better	Men has gowy eden bolmaly
I know.	Men bilýärin.
A year or two later, the same is true.	Bir ýa-da iki ýyl soň, edil şonuň ýaly.
Not much nowadays.	Häzirki wagtda köp däldi.
There was a reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi bardy.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
I have to go somewhere	Men bir ýere gitmeli
Right there and then.	Edil şol ýerde we soň.
He was also alone.	Ol hem ýeke boldy.
The moon is good.	Aý gowy.
I don't do that.	Men beýle zat etmeýärin.
Do it today.	Şu gün et.
He said he did.	Ol şeýle etdi diýdi.
For work	Iş üçin
It was the best fun ever.	Iň gowy gyzykly boldy.
I still have them and they are good	Mende henizem bar we olar gowy
He had fun.	Ol hezil etdi.
Which is good.	Haýsy gowy.
Police were everywhere.	Polisiýa hemme ýerde bardy.
That was no big deal.	Bu uly mesele däldi.
You can't go anywhere	Hiç ýere baryp bolmaz
I need to do more.	Maňa has köp zat etmek gerek.
I want you here.	Men sizi şu ýerde isleýärin.
We need time.	Bize wagt gerek.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
Bar!	Bar!
This is a wonderful thing.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp zat.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
I think it was great	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy boldy
He was not there yet.	Ol entek ýokdy.
I need money.	Mende pul bolmaly.
This is likely.	Bu ähtimal.
On the weekend, I even took a break	Dynç güni, hatda dynç aldym
He seemed to be able to do everything.	Her zady edip bilýän ýalydy.
He had time.	Wagty bardy.
I still agree with that	Men henizem muňa razy boldum
So there was no one.	Şonuň üçin hiç kim ýokdy.
He could do nothing now.	Indi hiç zat edip bilmedi.
I've never done that before.	Men ozal beýle etmedim.
I didn't have much trouble	Mende kän bir mesele ýokdy
I have to be here.	Men şu ýerde bolmaly.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
I know this is not true	Munuň dogry däldigini bilýärin
Sounds good.	Gowy ýaly.
I just thought.	Men diňe pikir etdim.
Here's who the guy is.	Ine, ýigit kim.
I can't do it yet	Men entek edip bilemok
Of course, I don't want that to happen.	Elbetde, beýle bolmak islämok.
I never liked it.	Men hiç haçan gowy görmedim.
I have no choice	Mende başga ýol bolmaz
It's beautiful there.	Ol ýerde owadan.
It was a very easy decision.	Bu gaty aňsat karar berdi.
I already said that.	Men muny eýýäm aýtdym.
I call him.	Men oňa jaň edýärin.
I'm not good enough	Men oňa ýeterlik däl
Same age	Şol bir ýaş.
We are close.	Biz ýakyn.
This is also easy.	Bu hem aňsat.
Often this is not true.	Köplenç bu dogry däl.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
I've never done that before	Men ozal beýle etmedim
Oh you bad!	Aý sen erbet!
He doesn't do that now.	Häzir muny etmeýär.
He was assisted by three others.	Oňa başga üç adam kömek etdi.
This is not the first time, of course.	Elbetde, ilkinji gezek däl.
He didn't have to do that.	Ol muny etmeli däldi.
He is right.	Ol dogry aýdýar.
I want to do something about it.	Men bu barada bir zat etmek isleýärin.
He may have just wanted a job.	Ol diňe bir iş islän bolmagy mümkin.
He is not.	Ol ýok.
More than that.	Has köp zat.
Not big or bad.	Uly ýa-da erbet däl.
And then he thought better.	Soň bolsa has gowy pikir etdi.
Someone does that.	Kimdir biri muny edýär.
The same	Şol bir.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
All you can say is.	Diňe aýdyp bilersiňiz.
I couldn't say that	Men muny aýdyp bilmedim
I do not have.	Mende ýok.
It shouldn't be now.	Häzir bolmaly däl.
I haven't seen anyone in a few days	Birnäçe gün bäri hiç kimi görmedim
Because it's fun	Sebäbi hezil
This is not the case.	Bu däl.
I hope this guy knows what he's doing	Bu ýigit näme edýändigini bilýär diýip umyt edýärin
Now there is something else.	Indi başga bir zat bar.
I really think so	Hakykatdanam şeýle diýip pikir edýärin
A few people.	Birnäçe adam.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
I did it for him	Men onuň üçin etdim
We can both go.	Ikimizem gidip bileris.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
Must be smarter.	Has akylly bolmaly.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
I just didn’t want to go there with him	Men diňe onuň bilen ol ýere gitmek islemedim
I think they exist.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar bar.
I'm worried about that.	Men muny biynjalyk edýärin.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
This cannot happen to them.	Bu olar üçin bolup bilmez.
I've been like this all day.	Men bütin gün şeýle boldum.
More beautiful	Has owadan.
I can't be in two places	Iki ýerde bolup bilemok
It sounded like bad news to him.	Bu oňa erbet habar ýalydy.
I haven't done it yet	Men entek etmedim
I think that person likes you.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol adam seni halaýar.
That's right.	Dogry.
Somewhere, then somewhere else.	Bir ýerde, soň başga bir ýerde.
That's all I have.	Bu meniň hemme zadym.
It was with you for the first time.	Ilkinji gezek seniň bilen boldy.
This is not the right thing to do.	Bu dogry zat däl.
There was another man	Başga bir adam bardy
I did it to hurt you	Men muny size zyýan bermek üçin etdim
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
He told her "no."	Ol oňa "ýok" diýdi.
This was his first time.	Bu onuň ilkinji gezek boldy.
Never enough.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik däl.
I heard it last night	Düýn agşam eşitdim
I saw what he did to me	Men onuň maňa näme edenini gördüm
We are good.	Biz gowy.
He doesn't know what happened to you.	Ol saňa näme bolandygyny bilenok.
The answer is already there.	Jogap eýýäm bar.
These are very difficult things.	Bu gaty kyn zatlar.
This is just a fact of life.	Bu diňe durmuş hakykaty.
I had an idea.	Mende bir pikir bardy.
I thought it was great	Gaty gowy diýip pikir etdim
It's not you.	Bu sen däl.
He must have known this morning.	Ol şu gün irden bilýän bolsa gerek.
Maybe it will help.	Belki kömek eder.
I was very worried	Men gaty biynjalyk boldum
It wasn't hard anymore, was it? 	Bu indi kyn däldi, şeýlemi?
he thought.	diýip pikir etdi.
It can never happen.	Hiç haçan bolup bilmez.
I have to be ready to go.	Men gitmäge taýyn bolmaly.
I wasn’t even mad at him	Men oňa hatda däli hem däldim
There was no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
I will always be close	Men elmydama ýakyn bolaryn
Of course, I know what happened	Elbetde, näme bolandygyny bilýärin
I hope he can help us	Ol bize kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin
Time was not an issue.	Wagt mesele däldi.
I told you, it's not good	Saňa aýtdym, gowy däl
You must be aware that something is wrong	Bir zadyň dogry däldigini bilýän bolmaly
It should be the same.	Şeýle hem bolmaly.
I really can't	Men hakykatdanam edip bilemok
I want it here tomorrow	Men ony ertir şu ýerde isleýärin
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
There is time.	Wagt bar.
You can do better!	Has gowy edip bilersiňiz!
He is busy.	Ol meşgul.
No one knew what to do with it.	Munuň bilen näme etmelidigini hiç kim bilmeýärdi.
She wants to help.	Kömek etmek isleýär.
This is another way.	Bu başga ýol.
I haven't seen you yet.	Men entek seni görmedim.
Only those two things.	Diňe şol iki zat.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
He does nothing.	Ol hiç zat etmeýär.
In fact, I was very busy	Aslynda gaty meşgul boldum
Nothing else will happen tonight.	Bu gije başga hiç zat bolmaz.
It does.	Bu edýär.
I thought of something else	Başga zat hakda pikir etdim
You still need it.	Size henizem gerek.
What a difficult year.	Nähili kyn ýyl.
What was he trying to do?	Näme etjek boldy.
We need it.	Bu bize gerek.
You have to be close to me tonight	Şu gije size ýakyn bolmaly
This is very likely	Bu gaty ähtimal
He gave no reason for his decision	Kararyna hiç hili sebäp bermedi
You have to go for help	Kömek üçin gitmeli
The biggest thing.	Iň uly zat.
This is a big mistake.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk.
Just two hundred years ago.	Diňe iki ýüz ýyl ozal.
He was not here either.	Ol hem bu ýerde däldi.
He just wants to be with me.	Ol diňe meniň bilen bolmak isleýär.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
I haven't been there yet	Men entek ol ýerde däldim
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
What's up now 	Indi näme bar?
.	.
It's worse now.	Indi has erbet.
They are two completely different proposals.	Olar düýbünden başga iki teklip.
I would like to say a few words about this	Bu hakda birnäçe söz aýtmak isleýärin
This is the most interesting.	Bu iň gyzykly.
I hope everything goes well with her	Hemme zat onuň bilen gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
Help me now.	Indi maňa kömek et.
I couldn't really help.	Men çynlakaý kömek edip bilmedim.
I know what this is all about	Bu zadyň näme edýändigini bilýärin
We don't need a new one.	Bize täze gerek däl.
There is no future.	Geljek ýok.
This is not the case with me.	Bu bolsa meniň ýaly däl.
Not as before.	Öňküsi ýaly däl.
He is no more.	Ol häzir ýok.
It will not be so easy.	Bu beýle aňsat bolmaz.
It could be, but it really wasn't.	Bolup biler, ýöne hakykatdanam beýle däldi.
And then it started.	Soň bolsa başlady.
Of course, he didn't.	Elbetde, ol beýle zat etmedi.
I couldn't get one	Men birini alyp bilmedim
No one wanted to do that.	Hiç kim muny etmek islemedi.
I've been here before.	Men öňem şu ýerde boldum.
This should not be the case, but it is.	Bu beýle bolmaly däl, ýöne şeýle.
That's a good idea.	Bu gaty gowy pikir.
I had to do it	Men bu işi etmeli boldum
I have to do that	Men muny etmeli
I had to respond quickly	Men çalt jogap bermeli boldum
There is hope and help.	Umyt we kömek bar.
The answer is often not beautiful.	Jogap köplenç owadan däl.
I do not.	Men ýok.
I have two things to report	Habar bermeli iki zadym bar
I was not there that year	Men ol ýyl ol ýerde däldim
Okay, maybe not so clear.	Bolýar, belki beýle aýdyň däl.
This road is easy.	Bu ýol aňsat.
Also.	Şeýle hem.
I know how long this has been around	Munuň näçe wagt öň bolandygyny bilýärin
Please, for me.	Haýyş edýärin, meniň üçin.
I thought she was very happy.	Gaty bagtly diýip pikir etdim.
I do not have this.	Bu mende ýok.
There was no problem here.	Bu ýerde hiç hili mesele ýokdy.
I have to say that.	Muny aýtmaly.
Oh, not a big deal.	Aý, gaty uly zat däl.
we	biz.
She is very young.	Ol gaty ýaş.
There is no one else like you.	Seniň ýaly başga adam ýok.
He did that to me last week.	Ol maňa geçen hepde şeýle etdi.
It makes him more human for me.	Ony meniň üçin has adam edýär.
That's it.	Ine, şol ýerde.
They just don’t exist.	Olar diňe ýok.
And for.	We üçin.
No one wants to talk to me.	Hiç kim meniň bilen gürleşmek islemeýär.
It was just good.	Diňe gowy boldy.
I just hope it helps	Diňe kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin
No adult.	Uly adam ýok.
I can't say anything else about the future	Geljek hakda başga zat aýdyp biljek däl
Because they are.	Sebäbi olar şeýle.
Not really there.	Aslynda ol ýerde däl.
He knew what he was doing.	Ol munuň näme edenini bilýärdi.
I think the guy is already here	Meniň pikirimçe, ýigit öňem şu ýerde
He never wanted it.	Ol muny hiç haçan islemedi.
I will do everything to be with you	Seniň bilen bolmak üçin her zat ederin
We are not ready for that.	Biz muňa taýyn däl.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Not a serious matter.	Çynlakaý mesele däl.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim
He was not a man to be betrayed.	Ol özüni bermeli adam däldi.
I have to admit that this was good for me.	Munuň maňa gowy bolandygyny boýun almaly.
He took it.	Ol ony aldy.
It's too short.	Bu gaty gysga.
I didn't want to go	Men gitmek islemedim
You are different.	Siz başga.
The night is wonderful.	Gije ajaýyp.
I need to know that he knows everything about it	Men onuň bu hakda hemme zady biljekdigini bilýän bolmaly
I knew it.	Men muny bilýärdim.
I never did that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmedim.
Anyone can do this right now.	Her kim muny şu wagt edip biler.
I had a lot to do tomorrow	Ertir etmeli köp zadym bardy
Not long.	Uzak däl.
This is certainly possible.	Bu, elbetde mümkin.
I didn't see it that way.	Men beýle görmedim.
I don't believe that	Men muňa ynanamok
Yourself.	Özüňiz.
He does it.	Ol muny edýär.
I am no longer for myself	Men indi özüm üçin däl
I thought it wasn't smart	Bu akylly däl diýip pikir etdim
It looks great on me.	Maňa gaty gowy görünýär.
Maybe too short.	Belki gaty gysga bolmagy mümkin.
You don't have to worry about it.	Oňa alada etmeli däl.
I have always been and will always be	Men hemişe boldum we hemişe bolaryn
Everything was very fast.	Hemme zat gaty çalt boldy.
I didn't want to go with him	Men onuň bilen gitmek islemedim
I had a lot of fun.	Men gaty hezil etdim.
He did just that.	Edil şonuň ýaly etdi.
I didn't have to tell anyone	Men hiç kime aýtmaly däldim
I was smart	Men akylly boldum
Good thing, but weird	Gowy zat, ýöne geň
It's more fun, but only once.	Bu has gyzykly, ýöne diňe bir gezek bolýar.
That should be sufficient enough.	Bu onuň üçin ýeterlik bolmaly.
I reported the call to police again	Bu jaň hakda ýene polisiýa habar berdim
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
How is that?	Munuň “nähili”.
I haven't seen him in three years	Men ony üç ýyl bäri görmedim
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Munuň sebäbi ýok bolsa gerek.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
I couldn't make another mistake	Başga bir ýalňyşlyk edip bilmedim
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
You are very good	Siz gaty gowy
I can't think anymore	Men indi pikir edip bilemok
This cannot be a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk bolup bilmez.
I don't have to answer it	Men oňa jogap bermeli däl
Of course.	Elbetde.
It should be.	Bu bolmaly.
It seemed like a big deal.	Bu gaty uly zat ýalydy.
It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
I don’t even want to think about it.	Bu hakda hatda pikir etmek hem islämok.
And maybe.	We mümkin.
I got it.	Bizi aldym.
I have always been pleased with you	Men elmydama senden razy boldum
He didn't know it.	Ol muny bilmeýärdi.
The two were one.	Ikisi bir boldy.
I can't say no to him	Men oňa "ýok" diýip biljek däl
It turned out really well.	Aslynda gaty gowy çykdy.
Nothing bad will happen.	Erbet zat bolmaz.
Not enough time.	Wagt ýeterlik däl.
I knew it now.	Men indi bilýärdim.
I knew he would never do that again	Onuň mundan beýläk beýle zat etmejekdigini bilýärdim
I want to say it exists	Men onuň bardygyny aýtmak isleýärin
I hope someone can help here.	Bu ýerde kimdir biri kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
I didn't need anything else	Maňa başga zat gerek däldi
He must have thought about it before	Bu hakda öňem pikir eden bolmaly
I only care about you	Men diňe siziň üçin alada edýärin
It could be for you.	Bu siziň üçin bolup biler.
Not much.	Kän däl.
It's too big for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty uly.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
This word again	Bu söz ýene
I'm not that stupid	Men beýle samsyk däl
Always beautiful	Elmydama owadan.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat däldi.
This seemed unlikely.	Bu ähtimal däl ýalydy.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
It can never be bought.	Hiç wagt satyn alyp bolmaz.
The moon is there.	Aý şol ýerde.
I can make another decision	Başga karar berip bilerin
I really want to help	Men hakykatdanam kömek etmek isleýärin
You are two people	Siz iki adam
I hope so.	Beýle bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
I can say these things	Men bu zatlary aýdyp bilerin
They were for me.	Olar meniň üçin boldy.
He climbed to the ground.	Ol gaty ýere çykdy.
Not necessarily.	Hökman däl.
It was not bad for him.	Bu onuň üçin erbet däldi.
I don't think so	Men muny etjek ýaly däl
I can't bother you.	Men sizi biynjalyk edip bilemok.
If there is no other issue now.	Indi başga mesele ýok bolsa.
Of course.	Elbetde.
We are really happy.	Biz hakykatdanam bagtly.
One day he came home.	Bir gün öýüne geldi.
I didn’t do anything about it, now he’s gone	Men bu barada hiç zat etmedim, indi ol gitdi
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu doly akylly.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
It can be fun.	Gyzykly bolup biler.
Do you think so?	Siziň pikiriňizçe şeýlemi?
Oh, there is something else.	Aý, başga bir zat bar.
You are the best	Sen iň gowy.
The next way is gone.	Indiki ýol hem gitdi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I don't know anything	Hiç zat bilemok
I was so mad at him	Men oňa şeýle bir däli boldum
This seems strange.	Bu geň zat ýaly.
That would be nice.	Şeýle bolsa has gowy bolardy.
This is just an idea.	Bu diňe bir pikir.
How can it be crazy?	Nädip däli bolup biler?
Not here.	Bu ýerde ýok.
I don't know how.	Nädip boljakdygyny bilemok.
I'm not far from here	Men bu ýerde uzak däl
I bought myself yesterday	Düýn özümi satyn aldym
Maybe it will.	Belki bolar.
I'm sorry to hear that.	Men size gynanýaryn.
How to tell you.	Size nädip aýtmaly.
I have to agree	Men razy bolmaly
That's it.	Bu şol.
I was crazy.	Men däli boldum.
Actually one thing.	Aslynda bir zat.
There was nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.
I didn't want to talk about it anymore	Indi bu hakda gürleşmek islemedim
It's a lot of people.	Bu köp adam.
With a guy.	Bir ýigit bilen.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Uly mesele.
He is not new to us.	Ol biziň üçin täze däl.
There is something else.	Başga zat bar.
He did not want to do that.	Ol muny etmek islemedi.
I did it once	Bir gezek etdim
I can be.	Men bolup bilerin.
I know, I really do	Bilýän, hakykatdanam edýärin
I will never be good again.	Men indi hiç haçan gowy bolmaz.
All he can say to her.	Oňa aýdyp biljek zatlary.
Then something will happen.	Soň bir zat bolar.
As a matter of fact.	Aslynda sorag ýaly.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
I want to be close to you	Men siziň bilen ýakyn bolmak isleýärin
I think he could fall asleep	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny uklap biler
This was not what he wanted.	Bu onuň islän zady däldi.
Something that is not the same as before.	Öňküsi ýaly däl bir zat.
Someone is coming.	Kimdir biri gelýär.
Everyone should do that.	Her kim muny etmeli.
It could have been a few years ago.	Birnäçe ýyl mundan ozal bolup biler.
He knows this now.	Ol muny indi bilýär.
I still don't believe it	Men henizem muňa ynanamok
I was alone.	Men ýeke boldum.
That will be enough for him.	Onuň üçin bu ýeterlik bolar.
Oh, they're there.	Aý, olar şol ýerde.
I had fun tonight	Şu gije hezil etdim
You didn't have to do that.	Muny etmek hökman däldi.
This is nothing.	Bu hiç zat däl.
I don't think it's that bad	Ol beýle erbet däl öýdýärin
They are enough.	Olar ýeterlik.
He just wanted to know.	Ol diňe bilmek isledi.
I knew it	Men muny bilýärdim
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
I can't be the reason.	Men munuň sebäbi bolup bilemok.
I knew nothing about them	Men olar hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
He is not.	Ol beýle däl.
I hope you can help me.	Maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt edýärin.
Who is this?	Bu kim.
There was something for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin bir zat bardy.
This is not just a job for me.	Bu meniň üçin diňe bir iş däl.
I loved it so much	Men edil şonuň ýaly gaty gowy gördüm
I just can't see the problem.	Meseläni diňe görüp bilemok.
I don’t think it’s that weird	Meniň pikirimçe, ol beýle geň däl
Good money	Gowy pul
No harm done. 	Zyýan ýok. 
I didn’t want to hurt him or you	Men oňa ýa-da saňa zyýan bermek islemedim
I've never seen this before	Men muny öňem görmedim
He is no more.	Ol häzir ýok.
I found it interesting	Men ony gyzykly gördüm
This is everywhere.	Bu hemme ýerde.
I can't do that to you.	Men seni muny edip bilemok.
Too bad, really.	Gaty erbet, hakykatdanam.
I have to be somewhere.	Men bir ýerde bolmaly.
I thought she was beautiful	Men owadan diýip pikir etdim
I'm not going to do that	Men muny etjek däl
He gave it to her.	Ol ony oňa berdi.
Strange things happen.	Geň zatlar bolýar.
We can.	Biz edip bileris.
Everyone wants to do that.	Her kim muny etmek isleýär.
This word is certainly not new.	Bu söz elbetde täze däl.
I really have to go	Men hakykatdanam gitmeli
I think it was good	Meniň pikirimçe, gowy boldy
No one offered to help me.	Hiç kim maňa kömek etmegi teklip etmedi.
I don't know anything else.	Mundan başga hiç zat bilemok.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
I only heard about it today	Men bu hakda diňe şu gün habar aldym
It's easy to say.	Muny aýtmak aňsat.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
It would be nice for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy bolardy.
I was so stupid to do that	Muny etmek üçin şeýle samsyk boldum
Because that's it.	Sebäbi ol şu.
Not good, but not bad.	Gowy däl, ýöne erbet däl.
I have been hearing about it for months	Bu hakda birnäçe aý bäri eşitdim
What happened to you	Saňa näme boldy?
Definitely didn't help.	Hökman kömek etmedi.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
I need you	Sen maňa gerek
I think it could be	Bolup biler öýdýärin
He was needed.	Ol zerur boldy.
He always has.	Ol hemişe bar.
This is not the first time.	Ilkinji gezek däl.
Maybe he has something.	Belki, oňa bir zat bar bolsa gerek.
Everything is the same.	Hemme zat bir zat.
Immediately the police called.	Derrew polisiýa jaň etdi.
You have to decide on a few things.	Birnäçe zat barada karar bermeli.
You need something else.	Size başga zat gerek.
I knew what he was doing	Men onuň näme edýändigini bilýärdim
He gave me hope.	Ol maňa umyt berdi.
Because he did it.	Sebäbi muny etdi.
I can do everything well.	Men hemme zady gowy edip bilerin.
Same song.	Şol bir aýdym.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
This is not a long road.	Bu uzak ýol däl.
No one questioned that.	Hiç kim muny sorag etmedi.
I just couldn't tell anyone	Diňe hiç kime aýdyp bilmedim
You have a good suggestion	Size gowy teklip bar
There was something, but not enough.	Bir zat bardy, ýöne ýeterlik däldi.
It was not about anyone.	Hiç kim hakda däldi.
I thought he would do it	Men muny eder öýdüpdim
He did.	Ol şeýle etdi.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
I know what he's thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilýärin
You know, it's good for me.	Bilýärsiň, bu meniň üçin gowy.
I know you still have	Siziň henizem bardygyny bilýärin
They didn't need it.	Olar oňa mätäç däldi.
What is this	Bu näme?
This can be detrimental.	Bu zyýan berip biler.
He was always there.	Ol hemişe bardy.
That's what happened.	Ol şeýle boldy.
I can't do anything about it anymore	Men indi bu barada hiç zat edip bilemok
Also the worst.	Şeýle hem iň erbet.
Everyone is against it.	Hemmeler muňa garşy.
I think that could be the case	Meniň pikirimçe, şeýle bolup biler
.	.
Many people.	Köp adam.
I didn't know what to do	Näme etmelidigimi bilmedim
I think about it.	Men bu hakda pikir edýärin.
I didn't even know it existed	Men onuň bardygyny hatda bilmeýärdim
I haven’t seen anything in the last year	Soňky bir ýyl bäri hiç zat görmedim
He was never.	Ol hiç wagt däldi.
I don't know how.	Nädip bilemok.
There, or there, or there.	Ol ýerde, ýa-da ol ýerde, ýa-da şol ýerde.
This week is short.	Bu hepde gysga.
A lot of work.	Köp iş.
I already knew he wouldn't help	Onuň hiç hili kömek etmejekdigini öňem bilýärdim
Good.	Gowy.
It will be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolar.
Good for them today.	Bu gün olar üçin gowy.
Maybe he doesn't know anything better.	Belki, mundan has gowy zady bilmez.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bu barada ýalňyşlyk ýok.
That's right- they are.	Dogry, olar.
Today	Bu gün.
Not this morning.	Şu gün irden däl.
Young man this morning.	Şu gün irden ýigit.
What a good man.	Nähili gowy adam.
I had a lot.	Mende köp zat bardy.
I really can't get it	Men hakykatdanam alyp bilemok
What a beautiful girl.	Nähili owadan gyz.
I think about it a little more	Bu hakda ýene birneme pikir edýärin
Time.	Wagt .
I didn't have one before	Mende öňem ýokdy
He is new to you.	Ol siziň üçin täze.
Answer.	Jogap.
This is absolutely wonderful.	Bu düýbünden ajaýyp.
This can be done alone or with help.	Muny ýeke ýa-da kömek bilen edip bolýar.
I really thought about it	Men hakykatdanam bu hakda pikir etdim
It's very difficult.	Ol gaty kyn.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
You can do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly edip bilersiňiz.
I still think so	Men henizem bar diýip pikir edýärin
In fact three times.	Aslynda üç gezek.
It's not about money.	Bu pul hakda däl.
It's easy and fun.	Bu aňsat we gyzykly.
It makes you happy.	Ol sizi bagtly edýär.
I became a better person	Men has gowy adam boldum
This is the last.	Bu iň soňky.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
He still didn't want to call anyone.	Ol henizem hiç kime jaň etmek islemedi.
I have money and life is wonderful	Mende pul bar we durmuş ajaýyp
I would like to visit you	Men size baryp görmek isleýärin
Couldn't hurt.	Zyýan berip bilmedi.
These things often happen.	Bu zatlar köplenç bolýar.
I saw it right away	Men derrew muny gördüm
The last few months have been very difficult.	Soňky birnäçe aý gaty kyn boldy.
It doesn't help.	Kömek etmeýär.
It's fast.	Bu çalt.
He knew.	Ol bilýärdi.
What did he do with it.	Näme bilen etdi.
I didn't see you there	Men seni ol ýerde görmedim
I can't really see anything else	Men hakykatdanam başga zady görüp bilemok
I really think about it a lot	Men hakykatdanam onuň hakda köp pikir edýärin
I'm not going to do that	Men muny etjek däl
I can't say.	Men aýdyp biljek däl.
This is not the case at all.	Bu düýbünden ýok.
Something bigger than me.	Menden has uly zat.
This seems to be true.	Bu dogry ýaly.
It takes a year to find out if it helped or not.	Kömek edendigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilmek üçin bir ýyl gerek.
It can always be better	Elmydama has gowy bolup biler
It was good to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy boldy.
I hope this works out for me.	Bu meniň üçin has gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
Necessary work	Zerur iş
I can take you to school	Men seni mekdebe alyp bilerin
OK, good.	Bolýar, gowy.
He often calls me.	Ol köplenç maňa jaň edýär.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman beýle däl.
It's fast, big.	Ol çalt, uly.
It's very difficult.	Gaty kyn.
Serious call	Çynlakaý jaň
Oh, okay, okay.	Aý, bolýar, gowy.
It's really smart.	Aslynda gaty akylly.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
You have to be there	Sen şol ýerde bolmaly
I was so bad at night.	Gije gaty erbet boldum.
I was there for a few days	Birnäçe gün boldum
A man who knows nothing.	Hiç zady bilmeýän adam.
Good weekend	Dynç güni gowy.
Now that can only be good !.	Indi bu diňe gowy bolup biler!.
It was not his business.	Bu onuň işi däldi.
I need it with me right now	Maňa şu wagt meniň bilen gerek
So it is not surprising to anyone.	Şonuň üçin bu hiç kime geň däl.
I really looked bad	Men hakykatdanam erbet gördüm
He wants it for himself	Ol özüni özi üçin isleýär
I think you should call me	Meniň pikirimçe, maňa jaň etmeli
he says.	ol aýdýar.
I really care about him	Men onuň hakda hakykatdanam alada edýärin
This bought me some time.	Bu maňa birnäçe wagt satyn aldy.
I hoped he didn't pay attention	Üns bermedi diýip umyt etdim
They weren't going to do it.	Olar muny etjek däldi.
Seeing the truth.	Hakykaty görmek.
It's just not smart.	Bu diňe akylly däl.
I think it makes me feel bad or something.	Bu meni erbet ýa-da bir zat edýär öýdýän.
This could be the reason	Munuň sebäbi bolup biler
This is often not the case.	Köplenç beýle däl.
He wanted to help.	Kömek etmegini isledi.
I have	Mende bar.
No one else did.	Başga hiç kim muny etmedi.
You have to be ready for that.	Munuň üçin taýyn bolmaly.
I really don't know	Men hakykatdanam bilemok
I have to be ready for that.	Men muňa taýyn bolmaly.
They really don't exist.	Olar hakykatdanam ýok.
Nothing else is possible.	Başga bir zat mümkin däl.
I can lend you	Men saňa karz berip bilerin
I could not see anything	Men hiç zady görüp bilmedim
I think he knows that.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny bilýär.
I couldn't see it	Men ony görüp bilmedim
I really don’t believe it, right	Hakykatdanam ynanamok, dogry
I believe that very much.	Men muňa gaty ynanýaryn.
Maybe not stupid at all.	Belki asla samsyk däl.
This is very new.	Bu gaty täze.
I've always been like that	Men elmydama şeýle boldum
I don't think it's there.	Ol ýerde bar öýdemok.
I'll call you tomorrow	Ertir saňa jaň ederin
This is what happens.	Bu şeýle bolýar.
I had to do the right thing	Dogry zady etmeli boldum
I almost suggested you	Men size diýen ýaly teklip etdim
Not yet.	Entek ýok.
I think that was good	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy boldy
You can do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly edip bilersiňiz.
I knew it.	Men muny bilýärdim.
I feel sorry for him now	Men oňa häzir gynanýaryn
I knew nothing about it	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
OK, you can go.	Bolýar, gidip bilersiňiz.
What does he do.	Ol näme edýär.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
They were nothing.	Olar hiç zat däldi.
This will be my next.	Bu meniň indiki bolar.
That says a lot.	Bu köp zady aýdýar.
This is the first time	Bu ilkinji gezek
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, ol maslahat berdi.
It was good to talk to him.	Onuň bilen gürleşmek gowy boldy.
So he had to do something fast.	Şonuň üçin ol çalt bir zat etmeli boldy.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
he asked.	diýip sorady.
We will never know.	Biz asla bilmeris.
Three years.	Üç ýyl.
I thought it was a good year.	Gowy ýyl diýip pikir etdim.
I called him.	Men oňa jaň etdim.
I actually think it could be good.	Aslynda bu gowy bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Size zerur bolmaly.
If one is needed.	Biri zerur bolsa.
The two are different.	Ikisi başga.
He fell asleep like you did.	Ol seniň ýaly uklap galdy.
He's a great guy.	Ol bir ajaýyp ýigit.
I hope it will be good	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
It shouldn't be bad.	Erbet bolmaly däl.
Everyone!	Her kim!
No one could.	Hiç kim edip bilmedi.
I will do this for you	Men muny siziň üçin ederin
A girl who doesn't know	Bilmeýän gyz
I thought tomorrow	Ertir pikir etdim
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
I am not.	Men beýle däl.
A year long	Bir ýyl uzak wagt
I have to do that	Men muny etmeli
I couldn't think of anything	Men hiç zat pikir edip bilmedim
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
He did not want to be happy.	Ol bagtly bolmak islemedi.
I thought it went well	Gowy gitdi öýdüpdim
I didn't really think about it	Men bu hakda hakykatdanam pikir etmedim
Of course.	Elbetde.
So we are there.	Şonuň üçin biz şol ýerde.
I got you another question.	Men saňa başga bir sorag aldym.
To be myself	Özüm bolmak
There are several reasons.	Birnäçe sebäp.
Of course there was someone.	Elbetde kimdir biri bardy.
I don't think we need anything	Bize hiç zat gerek däl öýdýän
I want one night	Bir gije isleýärin
This song is for us.	Bu aýdym biziň üçin.
I'm not crazy	Men däli däl
I had a lot of fun last night	Düýn agşam gaty hezil etdim
And then he did nothing.	Soň bolsa hiç zat etmedi.
This is not the case this year.	Bu ýyl beýle däl.
Only a few will do.	Diňe birnäçe adam eder.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda beýle etmeli däldi.
This can be tried.	Muny synap bolýar.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
I could tell he wasn't happy	Men onuň bagtly däldigini aýdyp bilýärdim
It will be difficult.	Kyn bolar.
I don't have to tell you anything.	Maňa bir zat aýtmak hökman däl.
This is the only thing.	Bu ýekeje zat.
I thought really fast	Men hakykatdanam çalt pikir etdim
I didn't mean to offend him	Men oňa hiç zat aýtmak islemedim
A month ago and I only cared about myself.	Bir aý öň we diňe özüm hakda alada etdim.
It will help you do that.	Muny etmäge kömek eder.
It's like crazy.	Bu däli ýaly.
I thought he did a good job.	Gowy iş etdi öýdüpdim.
That will not happen.	Şeýle zat bolmaz.
Doing the same is the right thing to do.	Dogry etmek şol bir zat.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
I got it yesterday	Men ony düýn aldym
This is never the case.	Hiç haçan beýle däl.
I am just a man	Men diňe bir adam
He had to do better things over time.	Wagty bilen has gowy zatlary etmeli boldy.
He did, but he didn't.	Ol etdi, ýöne etmedi.
Really good guy	Hakykatdanam gowy ýigit
He did it for me.	Ol muny meniň üçin etdi.
I told her he would be home tomorrow	Men oňa ertir öýde boljakdygyny aýtdym
I thought this was a really good thing	Munuň özi hakykatdanam gowy zat diýip pikir etdim
I knew something was up, but it wasn't	Bir zadyň bardygyny bilýärdim, ýöne beýle däl
He does what he wants.	Islän zadyny edýär.
I did this twice.	Men muny iki gezek etdim.
I don't want it any other way.	Başga ýol bilen islämok.
In fact, it's good.	Aslynda bu gowy.
I already knew he wouldn't	Onuň etmejekdigini eýýäm bilýärdim
I knew nothing about them	Men olar hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
I knew he would never do it	Men onuň asla etmejekdigini bilýärdim
It can't be here.	Ol bu ýerde bolup bilmez.
There was no one else to call.	Başga jaň etjek adam ýokdy.
Everyone knows the truth.	Hakykaty hemmeler bilýär.
Of course the sound.	Elbetde ses.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
I have to tell you something once	Saňa bir gezek bir zat aýtmaly
It wasn't me.	Bu men däldi.
I haven't seen it in a while	Biraz wagt bäri görmedim
The problem is huge.	Mesele munuň üçin gaty uly.
I don't think that's the case.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu bir däl.
I was like a fool	Men samsyk ýaly boldum
If possible	Mümkin bolsa.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim
He thought it looked good.	Gowy görünýär diýip pikir etdi.
This is not for a loved one.	Bu ýakyn adam üçin däl.
You and he are one.	Sen we ol bir.
He wanted to give her everything.	Oňa hemme zady bermek isledi.
He thought he was happy.	Ol bagtly diýip pikir etdi.
Just like you	Siz ýaly.
I wanted to do that	Men muny etjek boldum
I am a difficult person to buy	Satyn almak kyn adam men
There was no one.	Hiç kim ýokdy.
A guy like that has to go somewhere to have fun.	Onuň ýaly ýigit hezil etmek üçin bir ýere gitmeli.
I think the time has come	Meniň pikirimçe, wagt geldi
No wonder.	Geň zat ýok.
He didn't do that yesterday.	Düýn muny etmedi.
He can do that.	Ol muny edip biler.
He asked for help.	Kömek sorady.
I want to do that right.	Men muny dogry etmek isleýärin.
It's as if he never knew.	Hiç haçan bilmeýän ýaly däl.
He is as good as everyone else.	Ol hemmeler ýaly gowy.
It makes it more accurate.	Has dogry edýär.
Not a bad thing.	Erbet zat däl.
I didn't do anything good	Men gowy zat etmedim
I think everything is fine	Hemme zat gowy diýip pikir edýärin
I am very good	Men gaty gowy
I think that's enough tonight	Bu gije ýeterlik diýip pikir edýärin
A long time ago.	Köp wagt mundan ozal.
I shouldn't have done that	Men beýle etmeli däldim
No word yet on this.	Bu barada entek senden söz ýok.
No new messages.	Täze habar ýok.
This statement was not false.	Bu söz ýalan däldi.
I thought it wasn't really good	Aslynda gowy däl öýdüpdim
We have to be better.	Biz has gowy bolmaly.
I do not want	Men islämok
Really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy.
They just don’t exist.	Olar diňe ýok.
Okay, what.	Bolýar, näme.
This is not the case at all.	Bu düýbünden bir zat däl.
He does everything right	Ol hemme zady dogry edýär
I couldn't get enough of it.	Men oňa ýeterlik bolup bilmedim.
I couldn't do it right now	Şu wagt edip bilmedim
Not so.	Beýle däl.
Everyone knows what they are doing.	Her kim näme edýändigini bilýär.
Really	Hakykatdanam.
It was not easy for me.	Bu meniň üçin beýle aňsat däldi.
Last time, too, it took a while.	Geçen gezek hem birneme wagt gerek boldy.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly zat.
I can't tell you anymore	Indi saňa aýdyp biljek däl
I know this is not true.	Munuň dogry däldigini bilýärin.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
The word was astonishing.	Bu söz haýran galdy.
It will do the same.	Bu hem eder.
If you have time.	Wagty bolsa.
Good job.	Iş gowy.
I can't do that anymore	Men indi edip bilemok
I really don't need it	Maňa hakykatdanam gerek däl
There was a greater opportunity here.	Bu ýerde has uly mümkinçilik bardy.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
Not even a lie.	Hatda ýalan hem däl.
He even said that.	Ol hatda şeýle diýdi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Muny etmek dogry.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
I have seen this many times.	Muny köp gezek gördüm.
Everything was fine	Hemme zat gaty gowy boldy
It was as good as ever.	Öňküsi ýaly gowy boldy.
Maybe someday he'll be back.	Belki, bir gün bu ýere gaýdyp geler.
I hope everyone has a great day	Her kimiň ajaýyp güni bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I never knew it	Men muny asla bilmeýärdim
I can see it again.	Men ony ýene görüp bilerin.
I really don't know what happened this time.	Hakykatdanam bu gezek näme bolandygyny bilemok.
He does other things.	Başga zatlar hem edýär.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu beýle däl ýaly.
I don't want to do that	Men muny etmek islämok
Here's another one.	Ine, başga biri.
I knew it was impossible	Munuň mümkin däldigini bilýärdim
Not that night or ever.	Şol gije ýa-da hiç wagt däl.
He was late.	Ol gijä galdy.
That's what happened to me.	Meniň üçin bu boldy.
No one.	Hiç kim ýok.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
They can be more.	Olar has köp bolup biler.
Not for you.	Özüňiz üçin däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hakykatdanam iş.
It was not easy to see.	Görmek aňsat däldi.
He just did it.	Ol diňe bu işi etdi.
This cannot be done	Muny edip bolmaz
There was nothing for me.	Meniň üçin hiç zat ýokdy.
I saw him there.	Men ony şol ýerde gördüm.
Now I can't think for myself	Indi diňe özüm üçin pikir edip bilemok
I couldn't help it, I didn't want to help	Men oňa kömek edip bilmedim, kömek etmek islemedim
He said it was not.	Ol munuň beýle däldigini aýtdy.
They are more crazy.	Olar has däli.
This is the first time I've heard of it	Men muny ilkinji gezek eşitdim
I can't go on my own	Men özüm gidip bilemok
And I don't need you.	Sen bolsa, maňa gerek däl.
I heard him call me	Onuň maňa jaň edýändigini eşitdim
I think you should be	Meniň pikirimçe sen bolmaly
I wonder what that will be like.	Munuň nähili boljakdygyna haýran.
There is no sound.	Ol ýerde ses ýok.
He lives today.	Ol şu gün ýaşaýar.
No calls, nothing.	Jaň ýok, hiç zat ýok.
I already got a good girl	Men eýýäm gowy gyz aldym
She is really beautiful.	Ol hakykatdanam owadan.
I think it would be good	Gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
This is very important.	Bu gaty zerur.
How is it now.	Häzirki wagtda nähili.
This is never fun.	Bu hiç wagt gyzykly däl.
Great man	Ajaýyp adam
She looked good.	Ol gowy ýalydy.
I didn't think anyone was like me	Hiç kim meniň ýaly däl öýdemokdym
OK, that's right.	Bolýar, şeýle.
I really need to get a watch	Men hakykatdanam sagat almaly
Then he will have to decide for himself.	Soň bolsa özi karar bermeli bolar.
How is this possible?	Bu nädip mümkin?
It was too much to hope for.	Bu umyt etmek üçin gaty köp boldy.
I'll be home for him.	Men onuň üçin öýde bolaryn.
How wonderful it is.	Bu nähili ajaýyp.
It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
I'm not like anything else	Men başga zat ýaly däl
Nothing interesting.	Hiç hili gyzykly zat ýok.
He was mad at you.	Ol saňa däli boldy.
I still couldn't speak	Men henizem gürläp bilmedim
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
I can't believe it will happen	Onuň boljakdygyna ynanamok
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
You have to worry about that.	Bu barada alada etmeli.
Maybe everything will be fine.	Belki hemme zat gowy bolar.
It didn’t seem to be against it.	Muňa garşy däl ýalydy.
It seemed easy.	Bu aňsat ýalydy.
And maybe that's right.	We belki dogry bolar.
I can't say how it happened	Munuň nähili bolandygyny aýdyp biljek däl
This is good with us.	Bu biziň bilen gowy.
I never thought	Men asla pikir etmedim
The obvious reason.	Munuň aýdyň sebäbi.
I'm glad to do that	Men muny etmäge begenýärin
The first time he said something about you.	Ilkinji gezek ol sen hakda bir zat aýtdy.
He was right	Ol muny gaty dogry aýtdy
I will still be here	Men henizem şu ýerde bolaryn
Not everyone, not always, is often enough.	Hemmeler däl, hemişe däl, köplenç ýeterlik.
They have to be somewhere.	Olar bir ýerde bolmaly.
He is a really good guy.	Ol hakykatdanam ajaýyp ýigit.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
No questions, no answers.	Sorag ýok, jogap ýok.
I want that.	Men muny isleýärin.
A guy	Bir ýigit.
They are just stupid.	Olar diňe samsyk.
I can't destroy him or you	Men ony ýa-da seni ýok edip bilemok
Not until you.	Size çenli däl.
The future is gone.	Geljek indi gitdi.
This should give us more time to buy.	Bu bize has köp wagt satyn almaly.
It's not just money.	Bu diňe pul däl.
He said no, for today.	Ol ýok, şu gün üçin şeýle diýdi.
It looks better to me.	Maňa has gowy görünýär.
Not much.	Kän däldi.
Many	Köp.
There was no problem.	Mesele ýokdy.
Impossible, but possible !.	Mümkin däl, ýöne mümkin!.
I hope so.	Çynlakaý diýip umyt edýärin.
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, muňa garşy däldi
Maybe one day it will be.	Belki bir gün şeýle bolar.
I never thought so.	Men asla beýle pikir etmedim.
From now on, you and I.	Mundan beýläk sen we men.
I could not go home	Men öýe gaýdyp bilmedim
That would be a lie.	Bu ýalan bolar.
Maybe you can really help me.	Belki, maňa hakykatdanam kömek edip bilersiňiz.
I never saw him.	Men ony hiç haçan görmedim.
I couldn't see it	Men ony muny görüp bilmedim
I want to be happy with her here	Men bu ýerde onuň bilen bagtly bolmak isleýärin
This will help me.	Bu bolsa maňa kömek eder.
I thought it was too much	Gaty köp diýip pikir etdim
This time it would be the first.	Bu gezek ilkinji bolardy.
You can do one or the other.	Birini ýa-da başga birini edip bilersiňiz.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Gowy, şeýle bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
Then he realized.	Soň düşündi.
I had no such idea	Mende beýle pikir ýokdy
Looks like the right way.	Dogry ýol ýaly bolup görünýär.
That's what I think of him	Men onuň hakda şeýle pikir edýärin
This is the biggest question.	Bu iň uly sorag.
I am not and cannot be.	Men däl we bolup bilemok.
I hoped it would.	Bolar diýip umyt etdim.
This is great news.	Bu ajaýyp habar.
I need some help.	Biraz kömek etmeli.
I think they are.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar hökman.
He wants to know what happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilmek isleýär.
I already think of her as a girl	Men eýýäm ony gyz diýip pikir edýärin
It would be great to know what happened to him.	Oňa näme bolandygyny bilmek gaty gowy bolardy.
No one can see it.	Hiç kim ony görüp bilmeýär.
I have to take it	Men ony alyp gitmeli
Good or bad.	Gowy ýa-da erbet.
Everything is still there.	Hemme zat henizem.
It costs a lot of money.	Köp pul gerek.
This is it.	Bu şu.
No one wanted me.	Hiç kim meni islemedi.
Not you	Sen däl, men.
I knew no one would do that.	Hiç kimiň etmejekdigini bilýärdim.
I knew nothing about money.	Men pul hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
We are together	Biz bile.
I was alone	Men ýeke boldum
I still don't know what to do.	Näme etmelidigini henizem bilemok.
Of course, this is not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däl.
A little weird, but good	Biraz geň, ýöne gowy
That's what happened this week.	Bu hepde şeýle boldy.
I can't say anything better about anyone	Hiç kim hakda has gowy zat aýdyp biljek däl
I have called you several times over the past few weeks	Birnäçe hepde bäri size birnäçe gezek jaň etdim
he said.	' -diýdi.
I think that should be the hope	Munuň özi umyt bolmaly diýip pikir edýärin
Big.	Uly.
I told her everything	Men oňa hemme zady aýtdym
This is not a big deal.	Bu uly mesele däl.
There was something else that was not there before.	Başga bir zat bardy, öňem ýokdy.
He doesn't know better.	Ol has gowy bilmeýär.
I was right	Dogry aýtdym
It was a wonderful night.	Bu ajaýyp gije boldy.
Here you go	Ine, sen şol
He understood that.	Ol muňa düşündi.
I wasn’t really that good.	Men hakykatdanam beýle gowy däldim.
I think it was like that	Meniň pikirimçe, bu onuň ýalydy
Not here, he couldn't.	Bu ýerde däl, edip bilmedi.
This is a real lie.	Bu hakykatdanam ýalan.
It will definitely be big.	Elbetde uly bolar.
Something else came to her.	Oňa başga bir zat geldi.
Such a stupid mistake.	Şeýle samsyk ýalňyşlyk.
I am here almost every day	Men bu ýerde her gün diýen ýaly
Then he returns home.	Soň bolsa öýüne gaýdyp gelýär.
I was not at all surprised.	Men asla geň görmedim.
I heard good things	Gowy zatlar eşitdim
Because there was nothing to do.	Sebäbi etmeli zat ýokdy.
I didn't know what he was thinking	Onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilmedim
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I didn't think much of it	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmedim
I've never done that before.	Men ozal beýle etmedim.
You can tell the truth.	Hakykaty aýdyp bilersiňiz.
He wants to be like you.	Ol siziň ýaly bolmak isleýär.
No one could say.	Hiç kim aýdyp bilmedi.
I don't want that at all.	Men muny asla islämok.
Is that so?	Bu şeýlemi?
Of course.	Elbetde.
I didn't have to say much	Kän zat aýtmak hökman däldi
I'm stupid	Men samsyk.
It was also a good month for him.	Bu hem onuň üçin gowy aý boldy.
I got it today	Men ony şu gün aldym
Until then, no.	Oňa çenli, ýok.
He hoped it would be so.	Şeýle bolar diýip umyt etdi.
I agree with you	Men senden gaty razy
There is no other word for this.	Munuň üçin başga söz ýok.
I'm fine with that.	Men munuň bilen gowy.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
You can help.	Siz kömek edip bilersiňiz.
I know a lot that can help you	Size kömek edip biljek köp zady bilýärin
I've seen it twice.	Men ony iki gezek gördüm.
I think this is it	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şu
They will never be.	Olar asla bolmaz.
He is a lot of people.	Ol köp adam.
That's more.	Bu has köp.
I told her how to do it	Men oňa nädip etmelidigini aýtdym
He wants to go.	Ol gitmek isleýär.
This is not life.	Bu durmuş däl.
I can't say sorry	Bagyşlaň diýip biljek däl
There was everything about him.	Ol hakda hemme zat bardy.
I will never have it.	Men hiç haçan onuň bolmaz.
In fact, there is no right way.	Aslynda dogry ýol ýok.
It really does exist.	Hakykatdanam bar.
Every night	Her gije.
Nothing can be done about it.	Bu barada hiç zat edip bolmaz.
You don't have to do that for yourself	Muny seniň üçin etmeli däl
This is a difficult task to do every day.	Bu her gün etmek kyn iş.
I'm thinking again tonight	Şu gün agşam ýene pikir edýärin
I know this.	Men bu işi bilýärin.
Not you, no, not you.	Sen däl, ýok, sen däl.
One thing.	Bir zat.
He thought it might take three days.	Üç gün gerek bolup biler diýip pikir etdi.
I decided	Men karar berdim
I am the only one for you.	Men seniň üçin ýeke-täk zat.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Always a bad idea.	Elmydama erbet pikir.
Everyone knew that.	Muny hemmeler bilýärdi.
There is also a meal.	Şeýle hem nahar bar.
No one could go.	Hiç kim gidip bilmedi.
I didn't know that	Men muny bilmeýärdim
He is no more.	Ol indi ýok.
I believe this will be the best way	Munuň iň gowy ýol boljakdygyna ynanýaryn
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
I didn’t want to admit it	Men muny boýun almak islemedim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there	Bu diňe şeýle
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
You have to do that	Muny etmeli
This is not a good thing.	Bu gowy zat däl.
I often don't	Men köplenç beýle däl
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu iki däl, ýekeje sorag.

We are like everyone else.	Biz hemmeler ýaly.
That's what you want.	Ol seniň islän zadyň.
I couldn't tell what he was thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini aýdyp bilmedim
He is here and very close.	Ol şu ýerde we gaty ýakyn.

I still want to be that guy.	Men henizem ol ýigit bolmak isleýärin.
He lives there.	Ol şol ýerde ýaşaýar.
Of course, this was not the case here.	Elbetde, bu ýerde beýle däldi.
I'm not ready yet	Men entek taýyn däldim
He did whatever he wanted.	Islän zadyny etdi.
Bad thing.	Erbet zat.
He was no longer right.	Ol indi dogry däldi.
I'll do it myself.	Muny özüm ederin.
It turned out well.	Gowy çykdy.
This week is here, that week is there.	Bu hepde şu ýerde, şol hepde şol ýerde.
It's great for that.	Ol munuň üçin ajaýyp.
I think he knew something was up	Meniň pikirimçe, bir zadyň bardygyny bilýärdi
I want to have fun.	Men hezil etmek isleýärin.
I really think I should go now	Hakykatdanam indi gitmeli diýip pikir edýärin
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I was not very good	Men kän gowy däldim
That’s the only reason everyone wants to talk to me.	Her kimiň meniň bilen gürleşmek isleýän ýeke-täk sebäbi şol.
I didn't know it existed	Munuň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
That's the way it is.	Ol şeýle bolýar.

I do now.	Indi edýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu uly zat.
I hope it will be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
Not here.	Bu ýerde däl.
I didn't think about it	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim
Not so.	Beýle däl.
He wanted to talk now.	Ol indi gürleşmek isledi.
He could never do that.	Ol muny hiç wagt edip bilmedi.
I can think of another	Başga pikir edip bilerin
I don't have much to do	Meniň kän etmeli zadym ýok
He wanted to know and he didn't want to know.	Ol bilmek isledi we bilmek islemedi.
No one wants to.	Hiç kim islemeýär.
We have to be.	Biz bolmaly.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Muny aýdyp bolmaz "-diýdi.
I didn’t want to be here	Men bu ýerde bolmak islemedim
I don't want to be like that	Men onuň ýaly bolmak islämok
Like a lot of things.	Köp zat ýaly.
In fact, it takes a lot of fun today	Aslynda şu gün biraz hezil gerek
I don't know what happened to him	Oňa näme bolandygyny bilemok
I already did that	Men muny eýýäm etdim
I was not so happy	Men beýle bagtly däldim
I don't think so	Men beýle pikir etmeli däl
This time it was difficult.	Bu gezek kyn boldy.
Not much.	Kän bir zat däl.
This is his job.	Bu onuň işi.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
The answer should not be difficult.	Jogap kyn bolmaly däl.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
What a day it was.	Bu nähili gün boldy.
The man was right.	Adam dogry aýtdy.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
I don’t know where he wants to go with her.	Onuň bilen nirä gitmek isleýändigini bilemok.
He just knew.	Ol diňe bilýärdi.
I wanted to do something	Men bir zatlar etjek boldum
It could be worse.	Has erbet bolup biler.
He didn't have to do it, but he did.	Muny etmeli däldi, ýöne etdi.
It's very interesting.	Ol gaty gyzykly.
Everyone wants to be happy.	Her kim bagtly bolmak isleýär.
This is probably true.	Bu dogry bolsa gerek.
I can get another one	Başga birini alyp bilerin
He doesn't do that for you.	Ol muny siziň üçin etmeýär.
This is against you.	Bu saňa garşy.
I can offer you to go there	Men size ol ýere gitmegi teklip edip bilerin
Not a bad mistake.	Erbet ýalňyşlyk däl.
He thought so.	Ol şeýle diýip pikir etdi.
For work.	Iş üçin.
I didn’t care about anything anymore	Indi hiç zat hakda alada etmedim
It was good to help.	Kömek etmek gowy boldy.
He looks crazy.	Ol däli ýaly görünýär.
I just need a way	Maňa diňe bir ýol gerek
He could rest there.	Ol ýerde dynç alyp bilýärdi.
He didn't want to do that yet.	Ol entek muny islemedi.
She was amazed.	Ol muňa haýran galdy.
There is no other way	Başga ýol ýok
There was another and another.	Başga biri we başga biri bardy.
I can't see no one.	Hiç kimiň ýokdugyny görüp bilemok.
I couldn't speak much.	Men has köp gürläp bilmedim.
I'll be fine	Men gowy bolaryn
I never had to go	Men hiç haçan gitmeli däldim
I gave him something.	Men oňa bir zat berdim.
He doesn't think about it.	Ol bu hakda pikir etmeýär.
I didn't think much of it	Bu hakda kän pikir etmedim
He could not do it alone.	Ol ýeke özi edip bilmedi.
I have never seen anything more beautiful.	Men has owadan zady görmedim.
I just had a crazy idea	Mende diňe däli pikir bardy
This has happened so many times.	Bu gaty köp gezek boldy.
I think it could even take money for that	Munuň üçin hatda pul hem alyp biler öýdýärin
Not many people can afford it.	Köp adam muny alyp bilmeýär.
I did this almost every day.	Men muny bütin gün diýen ýaly etdim.
There are probably two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar bolsa gerek.
That's exactly what happened.	Bu edil şeýle boldy.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
Every summer.	Her tomus.
I thought it was great.	Ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim.
Now that is strange.	Indi bu geň zat.

This is probably not the case.	Bu dogry däl bolsa gerek.
This is strange.	Bu geň.

No it's not.	Ýok beýle däl.
I didn't know what happened to me	Mende näme bolandygyny bilmedim
There must be a reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi bolmaly.
It was a few calls.	Bu birnäçe jaň boldy.
Here's something.	Ine, bir zat.
I have something new.	Mende täze bir zat bar.
He could not go.	Ol gidip bilmedi.
So we have to decide.	Şonuň üçin biz karar bermeli.
You are either against us or against us.	Siz ýa-da biziň bilen, ýa-da garşy.
I know what happened to you	Saňa näme bolandygyny bilýärin
No one did anything.	Hiç kim hiç zat etmedi.
We are not together	Biz bile däl.
To be very good.	Gaty gowy bolmak.
I didn't think about it	Men bu barada pikir etmedim
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
I'll be better at home.	Men öýde has gowy bolaryn.
There was no other sound.	Başga ses ýokdy.
This is a huge deal.	Bu gaty uly iş.
He didn't know anything else.	Ol başga zat bilmeýärdi.
I am always and here	Men hemişe we şu ýerde
It looks good on me.	Bu maňa gowy görünýär.
This often happens.	Bu köplenç bolýar.
I am completely different	Men düýbünden başga zat
This is not a bad idea.	Bu erbet pikir däl.
There will be another opportunity.	Başga bir mümkinçilik bolar.

He was good to me.	Ol maňa gowy boldy.
He is such a good man.	Ol şeýle gowy adam.
You have to do this.	Bu işi etmeli.
It was impossible.	Iş mümkin däldi.
Of course he couldn't.	Elbetde, edip bilmedi.
I have to do that.	Men muny etmeli.
He can't go.	Ol gidip bilmeýär.
He needs to worry more.	Ol has köp alada etmeli.
This is an easy decision.	Bu aňsat karar.
Money is probably the biggest.	Pul iň uly bolmagy ähtimal.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
I never thought about it.	Men bu hakda hiç wagt pikir etmedim.
I really didn't want to go	Men hakykatdanam gitmek islemedim
It takes time.	Munuň üçin wagt gerek.
I couldn't do anything about it.	Bu hakda hiç zat edip bilmedim.
Not far, not far.	Uzak däl, uzak däl.
I must have helped you	Men saňa kömek eden bolmaly
No one at home knows.	Öýde hiç kim bilenok.

He said it was not.	Ol beýle däldigini aýtdy.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
It's so beautiful there.	Ol ýerde gaty owadan.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
It would be better.	Bu has gowy bolardy.

He returned home.	Öýüne gaýdyp geldi.
that's right	dogry.
I called again.	Men ýene bir gezek jaň etdim.
I don't think so.	Beýle bolar öýdemok.
I didn't have to	Entek etmeli däldi
I have to admit that this was the first one for me	Munuň meniň üçin ilkinji bolandygyny boýun almaly
I could not go to the police	Men polisiýa baryp bilmedim
She is also a girl.	Şeýle hem bir gyz.
This is not an idea.	Bu pikir däl.
He objected.	Ol muňa garşy çykdy.
For tonight	Bu gije üçin.
He is such a good guy.	Ol şeýle bir gowy ýigit.
He noticed that.	Ol muňa üns berdi.
This is a great time.	Bu ajaýyp wagt.
The future is really something.	Geljek hem hakykatdanam bir zat.
I didn't think about it	Men bu barada pikir etmedim
I just had to relax and do it	Diňe dynç almaly we muny etmeli boldum
This is good for us.	Bu biziň üçin gowy.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
Not a difficult decision.	Kyn karar däl.
Now everything seemed possible to him.	Häzir oňa hemme zat mümkin ýalydy.
I want something wonderful with you	Men siziň bilen ajaýyp bir zat isleýärin
I could never sleep	Men asla uklap bilmedim
It's time for him.	Onuň üçin wagt geldi.
I didn’t do it for money	Men muny pul üçin etmedim
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
This is true of many things.	Bu köp zat dogry.
They are so beautiful.	Olar gaty owadan.
I need help.	Kömek gerek.
I don't have to tell you that	Muny saňa aýtmaly däl
So it took a while.	Şonuň üçin birneme wagt gerek boldy.
I knew it wasn't there	Men onuň ýokdugyny bilýärdim
I thought you needed more trouble	Size has köp kynçylyk gerek diýip pikir etdim
I thought he really liked me	Ol meni hakykatdanam halaýar diýip pikir etdim
She is no longer beautiful.	Ol indi beýle owadan däl.
He was always there.	Ol hemişe bardy.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Seems like a good idea	Gowy pikir ýaly bolup görünýär
She didn't have to tell him.	Oňa aýtmaly däldi.

I did not know that such a thing could happen	Munuň ýaly bir zadyň bolup biljekdigini bilmeýärdim
I can't see myself with anyone	Özümi hiç kim bilen görüp bilemok
This is really for them.	Bu hakykatdanam olar üçin.
He may have asked her to do it.	Ol muny etmegini haýyş eden bolmagy mümkin.
There is more.	Has köp zat bar.
There will be nothing to worry about.	Alada etjek zat bolmaz.
It was a good week.	Bu gowy hepde boldy.

Good money for time, great money.	Wagt üçin gowy pul, uly pul.
Not a bit.	Biraz däl.

He also did not call.	Şeýle hem, jaň etmedi.

This is very serious.	Bu gaty çynlakaý.

The song was good and good.	Aýdym gowy we gowy boldy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, indi beýle däl.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
Nothing he does with a book can hurt him.	Kitap bilen eden hiç zady oňa zyýan berip bilmez.
This is really good news.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy habar.
That would be really strange.	Bu hakykatdanam geň bolar.
I know, I heard you.	Bilýän, seni eşitdim.
I think everyone did that	Meniň pikirimçe, hemmeler şeýle etdi
In fact, I wasn't anywhere	Aslynda men hiç ýerde däldim
This made him anxious.	Bu ony biynjalyk etdi.
There are only two jobs.	Diňe iki iş bar.
Not now, not tonight.	Häzir däl, şu gije däl.
Gone together.	Bilelikde gitdi.
He did not want to talk to anyone.	Ol hiç kim bilen gürleşmek islemedi.
I called again	Men ýene jaň etdim
Looks like a man.	Adam ýaly bolup görünýär.
Almost everyone does.	Hemmeler diýen ýaly edýär.

He just does the right thing.	Diňe dogry zady edýär.
Nothing will happen now.	Indi hiç zat bolmaz.

There are several ways.	Birnäçe ýol bar.

Of course in the morning.	Elbetde irden.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.

Crazy life.	Däli durmuş.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Edil şu wagt wagt geldi.
You don't have to be right.	Dogry bolmak hökman däl.
I was in a bad place	Men erbet ýerde boldum
Time is of the essence.	Wagt hem mesele.
I took a week off to be with them	Olar bilen bolmak üçin bir hepde dynç aldym
I have seen him several times	Men ony birnäçe gezek gördüm
He could see nothing.	Ol hiç zady görüp bilmedi.
Really nice guy	Hakykatdanam ajaýyp adam
Worse.	Has erbet.
I've never done that before	Men ozal beýle zat etmedim
There must be good news somewhere.	Bir ýerde gowy habar bolmaly.
You know, there's a lot of trouble there.	Bilýärsiň, ol ýerde köp kynçylyk bar.
This is the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek boldy.
He gave me the money.	Ol maňa pul berdi.
I didn't do enough	Men ýeterlik iş etmedim
Good night	Şu gije gowy.
I believe that very much.	Men muňa gaty ynanýaryn.
Nothing calls.	Hiç zat jaň etmeýär.
He wants to do it again.	Ol muny ýene bir gezek etmek isleýär.
I can't take it anymore	Men muny indi alyp bilemok
I have money	Mende pul bar
This is nothing.	Bu hiç hili zat däl.
I haven't done it yet	Men entek edip bilmedim
Okay.	Bolýar.
I already know what he thinks	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini eýýäm bilýärin
An idea came to him.	Oňa bir pikir geldi.
More	Has köp.
It could be the same.	Şeýle hem bolup biler.
Of course I can	Elbetde, alyp bilerin
Something big is coming.	Uly bir zat gelýär.
I called him and he told me everything	Men oňa jaň etdim, ol maňa hemme zady aýtdy
I'm sorry about that.	Munuň üçin gynanýaryn.
It was no longer enough.	Indi ýeterlik däldi.
It was not a pleasure for him.	Bu onuň üçin lezzet däldi.
It's not enough to be good.	Gowy bolmak ýeterlik däl.
I'd like to make an offer	Teklip bermek isleýärin
I couldn't get enough of it	Men muňa ýeterlik bolup bilmedim
I could not say anything.	Men hiç zat aýdyp bilmedim.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
I can tell the time	Wagt hem aýdyp bilerin
Not there.	Ol ýerde ýok.
Tell me a little bit about it.	Bu hakda maňa biraz aýdyň.
There are so many good things going on there.	Ol ýerde gaty gowy zatlar bar.
It's really fast.	Bu hakykatdanam çalt.
Absolutely right.	Elbetde, dogry.
I can't help it	Men oňa kömek edip bilemok
One year.	Bir ýyl.
It was as if he wanted to.	Ol islän ýalydy.
I saw that this was the case	Men munuň şeýle bolandygyny gördüm
That fact must be taken into account. "	Hakykatdanam bu söz ýok.
Because it doesn’t have to be that way.	Sebäbi beýle bolmaly däl.
She was amazed.	Oňa haýran galdy.
I just have to do it	Men muny diňe etmeli
In fact, it was not necessary to do so	Aslynda muny etmek hökman däldi
It's not easy.	Muny etmek aňsat däl.
That's it.	Bu zat.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
I can see us as we are now	Bizi edil häzirki ýaly görüp bilýärin
I couldn't be with him anymore	Men indi onuň bilen bolup bilmedim
He was not even close.	Ol hatda ýakyn hem däldi.
And then he came back.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp geldi.
So there is no such thing.	Şonuň üçin beýle zat ýok.
I think we can do that	Muny edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin
Someone is mine.	Kimdir biri meniň.
There is no answer.	Ol ýerde jogap ýok.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
I want to do that and we can do that.	Muny etmek isleýärin we edip bileris.
He let me go and do it	Maňa gitmäge we muny etmäge rugsat berdi
He knows it and he doesn't know it.	Muny bilýär we bilmez.
It's easy to do that.	Muny etmek aňsat.
I didn't think so	Men muny pikir etmedim
I could not go	Men gidip bilmedim
I had no such thing	Mende beýle zat ýokdy
Not only good.	Diňe gowy däl.
He is just like us.	Ol edil biziň ýaly.
I wanted to do more than that	Mundan has köp zat etjek boldum
I need help.	Kömek gerek.
This is the first thing.	Bu ilkinji zat.
I tried to call her, but there was no answer	Men oňa jaň etjek boldum, ýöne jogap ýok
You really are yourself	Siz hakykatdanam özüňiz
I will be with that man.	Men ol adam bilen bile bolaryn.
Even where.	Hatda nirede.
He could not ask for it himself.	Onuň üçin özi sorag edip bilmedi.
This will be the last.	Bu iň soňky bolar.
I did not agree	Men muňa razy däldim
I know this is not just me.	Munuň diňe özüm däldigini bilýärin.
This is not bad	Bu erbet däl
I'm sure he can do that	Munuň düýbünden edip biljekdigine ynanýaryn
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I always call.	Men elmydama jaň edýärin.
He can call.	Jaň edip biler.
This can often happen.	Bu köplenç bolup biler.
I don't know anything about him	Men ol hakda hiç zat bilemok
I hope you can help me	Maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt edýärin
He was not either.	Ol hem däldi.
He doesn't have to.	Ol hökman däl.
I let him.	Men oňa rugsat berdim.
The weekend was so good.	Dynç güni şeýle gowy boldy.
I could not go	Men gidip bilmedim
I think that's the way it is	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle bolýar
No answer yet.	Entek jogap ýok.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
That will be the case.	Şeýle bolar.
This is not a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý zat däl.
I'm not alone anymore	Men indi ýeke däldim
You are young, beautiful, beautiful.	Sen ýaş, owadan, ajaýyp.
Not from me.	Menden däl.
He lives for it.	Munuň üçin ýaşaýar.
I could see the problem	Meseläni görüp bilýärdim
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
They are not there yet.	Olar henizem ýok.
It's easier to think of it now.	Ony indi pikir etmek has aňsat.
Something like this could happen.	Munuň ýaly zat bolup biler.
This is a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý iş.
I didn’t know if he knew it or not.	Men onuň muny bilýändigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilmedim.
I called him, but he didn't answer	Men oňa jaň etdim, ýöne ol jogap bermedi
I couldn't think of anything.	Men hiç zat pikir edip bilmedim.
I will destroy them all	Hemmesini ýok ederin
Because he was crazy.	Sebäbi däli boldy.
Definitely not right.	Hökman dogry däl.
You don't have to do that, you know.	Muny etmeli däl, bilýärsiň.
That's a good idea.	Bu gaty gowy pikir.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
I don't know at all	Men asla bilemok
I will do it	Men muny ederin
There was no way to find out.	Muny bilmek üçin hiç hili ýol ýokdy.
I did not want to give him false hope	Men oňa ýalan umyt bermek islemedim
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
I thought you should be here.	Sen şu ýerde bolmaly diýip pikir etdim.
I totally agree with that.	Men muňa doly razy.
I thought it was there	Men ol ýerde bar öýdüpdim
I can't see it	Men ony görüp bilemok
Now you have to rest.	Indi dynç almaly.
I think you're crazy	Sen däli diýip pikir edýärin
I thought it was interesting	Bu gyzykly diýip pikir etdim
He is not.	Ol beýle däl.
This is not just what happened here.	Bu diňe şu ýerde bolup geçen zat däl.
It's not easy to do that.	Muny etmek aňsat zat däl.
I can't get everything	Men hemme zady alyp bilemok
I had to do these things alone	Bu zatlary ýeke özüm etmeli boldum
I think it’s great to visit here	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýere baryp görmek gaty gowy
We are one.	Biz bir.
He objected.	Garşy çykdy.
He just doesn’t want a lot of people.	Ol diňe köp adam islemeýär.
In fact for many years.	Aslynda köp ýyl.
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
He did it very well	Ol muny gaty gowy etdi
If he did it once, he could do it again.	Bir gezek eden bolsa, ýene edip biler.
I saw him this morning	Men ony irden gördüm
I didn't know what to do with him	Onuň bilen näme etmelidigimi bilmedim
I seriously doubt that	Men muňa çynlakaý şübhelenýärin
And he sings.	We aýdym aýdýar.
I really don't know how long that will last	Hakykatdanam munuň näçe wagt boljakdygyny bilemok
I think that's the problem	Bu mesele diýip pikir edýärin
For several years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri.
If he is happy.	Bagtly bolsa.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I'm worried about you	Men saňa gaty alada edýärin
This is the last time.	Bu gezek iň soňky gezek.
Now he is gone.	Indi ol gitdi.
I can't do that	Men muny edip bilemok
There is something.	Bir zat bar.
He can still do it.	Ol henizem edip biler.
What’s not there, what’s not.	Ol ýerde näme bar däl, näme ýok.
It always worries me about something.	Elmydama meni bir zat hakda alada edýär.
There is another.	Başga biri bar.
He is right here.	Ol edil şu ýerde.
This is not fast.	Bu çalt däl.
Double fast.	Iki gezek çalt.
He did not want to tell the truth.	Ol hakykaty aýtmak islemedi.
I obeyed him.	Men oňa boýun boldum.
I have another suggestion	Mende başga bir teklip bar
Everyone knows about them	Hemmeler olar hakda bilýär
This is a very bad opportunity.	Bu gaty erbet mümkinçilik.
He does what he wants.	Ol isleýän zadyny edýär.
This may be true.	Munuň dogry bolmagy mümkin.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Diňe hiç zat ýok.
Great for summer.	Tomus üçin ajaýyp.
He is a man.	Ol adam.
What is this?	Bu näme?.
Definitely happy.	Elbetde bagtly.
This seems a little common to all.	Bu hemmeler üçin birneme kän görünýär.
There are two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar.
Of course you know that.	Elbetde, muny bilýärsiň.
Not one, many.	Bir däl, köp.
He is a smart guy.	Ol akylly ýigit.
You know, there's a lot.	Bilýärsiň, köp zat bar.
I am a very good person.	Men gaty gowy adam.
I have nothing.	Mende hiç zat ýok.
It will be worse.	Bu has erbet bolar.
Maybe next time.	Belki indiki gezek.
I have said this once before.	Men muny öňem bir gezek aýtdym.
He can't go here.	Ol bu ýere size baryp bilmez.
Bad things can happen.	Erbet zatlar bolup biler.
Gone in the morning.	Irden gitdi.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I can't go back there	Men ol ýere gaýdyp bilemok
I could control myself	Men özümi alyp bilýärdim
He knows exactly what he is doing to me.	Ol maňa näme edýändigini gowy bilýär.
I didn't have to tell him anything	Men oňa hiç zat aýtmaly däldim
I'm really interested	Men hakykatdanam gyzykly
There was no time.	Wagt ýokdy.
Not to mention that.	Bu hakda söz ýok.
I can't take it anymore	Indi alyp bilemok
It's me.	Bu men.
I thought what happened	Näme boldy diýip pikir etdim
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
He asked after you.	Ol senden soň sorady.
Of course, he was not quite right yet.	Elbetde, ol entek gaty dogry däldi.
This is the first time I've heard of him.	Men onuň hakda ilkinji gezek eşitdim.
It looks like this.	Şeýle görünýär.
That was not the case.	Munuň sebäbi däldi.
I can't think of it	Men bu hakda pikir edip bilemok
I didn't have to say that	Muny aýtmaly däldim
It makes me crazy.	Bu meni däli edýär.
You can think well.	Gowy pikir edip bilersiňiz.
I could be so stupid.	Men gaty samsyk bolup bilerin.
Only the two of us.	Diňe ikimiz.
In the morning.	Irden.
He does so and how.	Ol şeýle edýär we nädip.
I don't want it here.	Men bu ýerde islämok.
Isn't it his happy day?	Onuň bagtly güni dälmi?
He thought it was a bad thing	Ol bir hili erbet zat diýip pikir etdi
You have to think it's impossible	Mümkin däl diýip pikir etmeli
It could be.	Bolup biler.
I didn't have to go home	Öýe gitmeli däldim
Of course, it's different, but it's different.	Elbetde, ol başga, ýöne başga.
I haven't tried it yet.	Men entek muny synap görmedim.
This, of course, can be thought of.	Bu, elbetde, pikir edip bolar.
I know he wants you too	Onuň hem seni isleýändigini bilýärin
It doesn't have to be that way.	Şeýle hem bolmaly däl.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
This seems very strange.	Bu gaty geň görünýär.
I can't take money from you	Men senden pul alyp bilemok
You have to do this for me.	Muny meniň üçin etmeli.
Well, everything is fine.	Gowy, hemme zat gowy.
It helps.	Bu kömek edýär.
This is a very strange question.	Bu birneme geň sorag.
Everything will be fine	Hemme zat gowy bolar
Seems like a good idea.	Gowy pikir ýaly bolup görünýär.
I just need advice.	Maňa diňe bir maslahat gerek.
There is not much to do.	Munuň üçin kän zat ýok.
He did a good job.	Gowy iş etdi.
I can't help it.	Men oňa kömek edip bilemok.
A few years	Birnäçe ýyl
I really	Men hakykatdanam
I need something big	Maňa uly bir zat gerek
He did not know it would be the last.	Ol munuň iň soňky boljakdygyny bilmeýärdi.
It can't be serious.	Çynlakaý bolup bilmez.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu ýerde dynç almaly.
I didn't think so	Men muny pikir etmedim
I want to be a guy	Men ýigit bolmak isleýärin
That's fine with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy.
I should never have done that	Men muny hiç haçan etmeli däldim
It is both easy and difficult to answer.	Jogap bermek hem aňsat, hem gaty kyn.
There	Şol ýerde.
You can do it yourself.	Özüňiz edip bilersiňiz.
I can't see anything right now	Men häzir hiç zady görüp bilemok
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolardy.
Great	Ajaýyp.
I didn't think about it	Men bu barada pikir etmedim
Okay, not too hard.	Bolýar, gaty kyn däl.
I am really good and not beautiful	Men hakykatdanam gowy we owadan däl
He is not here.	Ol bu ýerde däl.
He asked what he would do that evening.	Ol agşam näme etjekdigini sorady.
I didn't need to.	Maňa gerek däldi.
I had never thought of that before.	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I did not know	Bilmedim.
I decided	Men karar berdim
These two are different.	Bu ikisi başga.
I didn't want to talk to anyone	Hiç kim bilen gürleşmek islemedim
The first night he was here	Ilkinji gije ol şu ýerde boldy
he asked.	diýip sorady.
He needs attention, he needs care.	Oňa üns gerek, alada gerek.
There are two issues with this idea.	Bu pikir bilen iki mesele bar.
This is a really good thing.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy zat.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I couldn't think anymore.	Indi pikir edip bilmedim.
They can be a lot of work.	Olar köp iş bolup biler.
Must be only once.	Diňe bir gezek bolmaly.
Very good question.	Gaty gowy sorag.
I was not ready to do that	Men muny etmäge taýyn däldim
I thought about one thing, I thought of another	Bir zat hakda pikir etdim, başga bir zat pikir etdi
The problem.	Kynçylyk.
This is for us.	Bu biziň üçin.
I've never seen you with a girl before.	Men seni öň hiç wagt gyz bilen görmedim.
And good reason.	We gowy sebäp.
I want to be like you	Men seniň ýaly bolmak isleýärin
Of course it happened.	Elbetde boldy.
It's a bit.	Ol birneme.
Just like me	Edil özüm ýaly.
He must have thought about it.	Ol bu barada pikir eden bolmaly.
Stop right away.	Derrew bes et.
Only if he can speak.	Diňe gürläp bilýän bolsa.
I knew it was going to be a big deal.	Munuň uly bir zat boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
He thought I knew it	Men muny bilýärin diýip pikir etdi
No one said.	Hiç kim aýtmady.
I didn't think that would happen	Munuň boljakdygyny pikir etmedim
Now I had to decide	Indi karar bermeli boldum
He is not here.	Ol bu ýerde däl.
This, of course.	Bu, elbetde.
I don't think they're human.	Olar adam däl öýdemok.
No need to go any further.	Mundan beýläk gitmek hökman däl.
I had a lot of questions	Mende köp sorag bardy
She is very young.	Ol gaty ýaş.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
It was not a good thing.	Gowy zat däldi.
It was great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy boldy.
I don't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmeýärin.
It will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek bolar.
Just what he hoped for.	Diňe onuň umyt eden zady.
The impossible was possible.	Mümkin däl zat mümkin boldy.
He started to worry a little.	Biraz alada edip başlady.
I hope it comes.	Geler diýip umyt edýärin.
It does.	Şeýle edýär.
It's not like he stopped doing that	Muny etmegi bes eden ýaly däl
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
Speak loudly.	Gaty ses bilen aýdyň.
I had a lot of fun there	Men ol ýerde gaty hezil etdim
It wasn't bad.	Erbet däldi.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
He never knew.	Ol hiç wagt bilmeýärdi.
It can never happen again.	Başga hiç wagt bolup bilmez.
Of course he does.	Elbetde, şeýle edýär.
There was nothing that could help me.	Maňa kömek edip biljek hiç zady ýokdy.
He just seemed to know what to do.	Ol diňe näme etmelidigini bilýän ýalydy.
I couldn't go anymore	Men indi gidip bilmedim
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
Of course, I am not alone.	Elbetde, men ýeke däl.
Together	Bilelikde.
This was not the case for me.	Bu meniň üçin beýle däldi.
He can't do anything else.	Başga hiç zat edip bilmez.
No need.	Gerek däldi.
He told me the truth.	Maňa hakykaty aýtdy.
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu dogry däl.
This is back to you.	Bu siziň üçin gaýdyp gelýär.
I saw you and thought you were so beautiful	Men seni gördüm we gaty owadan diýip pikir etdim
A week later.	Soň bir hepde.
I think so	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle
I really can't think of it	Hakykatdanam, bu hakda pikir edip bilemok
There is more.	Has köp zat bar.
Happy to do that.	Muny etmek üçin bagtly.
I only have one message	Mende diňe bir habar bar
She is so weird.	Ol şeýle bir geň.
I have	Mende bar.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
It's bad.	Ol erbet.
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Munuň dogry bolup bilmejekdigini aýtdy.
Now it was fun.	Indi bu gyzykly boldy.
There is a possibility.	Mümkinçilik bar.
Good! 	Gowy!
Had a good evening	Agşam hezil etdi.
I was home alone and alone	Men öýde ýeke özüm we ýeke özüm boldum
A new challenge.	Täze kynçylyk.
It's great to be right.	Dogry bolmak gaty gowy.
There were a lot of people there.	Ol ýerde gaty köp adam bardy.
Who knows if something will happen.	Bir zadyň boljakdygyny kim bilýär.
It will not happen again.	Indi beýle bolmaz.
I'm not sure he'll do that	Onuň muny etjekdigine ynanamok
He never spoke to her.	Ol hiç haçan oňa söz aýtmady.
I don't think so	Wagt ýokdy öýdýän
I think we can do more and better.	Has köp we has gowy edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin.
Someone had to do it.	Kimdir biri etmeli boldy.
I never knew enough.	Men hiç wagt ýeterlik bilmedim.
This is a difficult task for me.	Bu meniň üçin kyn mesele.
I have to help her	Men oňa kömek etmeli
I just couldn't say it before	Diňe öň aýdyp bilmedim
I know it's not easy to be here	Bu ýerde bolmak aňsat däldigini bilýärin
It will not happen again.	Indi beýle bolmaz.
It's good to have, but it takes time.	Bolmagy gowy zat, ýöne muny etmek üçin wagt gerek.
I could never do that	Men muny hiç wagt edip bilmedim
Maybe he did it.	Belki, muny eden bolsa gerek.
I think there's a message here	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýerde habar bar
Just not fast enough or smart.	Diňe ýeterlik çalt ýa-da akylly däl.
I've been thinking about this for a while	Birnäçe wagt bäri bu hakda pikir edýärin
He has to do it for himself.	Muny özi üçin etmeli.
It's just that.	Bu diňe.
You are that	Sen şol.
This is me.	Bu düýbünden men.
I think this can help	Bu kömek edip biler diýip pikir edýärin
I didn't think it was a good idea	Gowy pikir diýip pikir etmedim
I know a few things about you.	Men sen hakda birnäçe zady bilýärin.
This is a great book.	Bu ajaýyp kitap.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
He is a very serious man.	Ol gaty çynlakaý adam.
I'm not human for this	Men bu iş üçin adam däl
More	Has köp.
Not true.	Dogry däl.
Not that night, not another night.	Şol gije däl, başga bir gije däl.
I can't think of it.	Men bu hakda pikir edip bilemok.
I didn't know that	Men ol hakda bilmeýärdim
I have to call the police	Men polisiýa jaň etmeli
He wanted to be with her.	Onuň bilen bile bolmak isledi.
I had a lot of fun.	Men gaty hezil etdim.
Not now, but at the time.	Häzir däl, şol wagt şeýle boldy.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
He can give and he can.	Ol berip biler we alyp biler.
Everyone is there.	Hemmeler ol ýerde.
Anyone can.	Her kim edip biler.
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat.
He had work to do now.	Häzir etmeli işi bardy.
There is nothing for the future.	Geljek üçin hiç zat ýok.
It’s actually kind of cool.	Aslynda bir hili ajaýyp.
Just not enough.	Diňe ýeterlik däl.
You can do one or the other.	Birini ýa-da başga birini edip bilersiňiz.
I think this book will help	Bu kitap kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin
Just every day.	Diňe her gün.
I knew who could do it and who couldn't	Kimiň edip biljekdigini we kimiň edip bilmejekdigini bilýärdim
And you are me	Sen bolsa men.
I thought about what he did to me	Onuň maňa eden zatlary hakda pikir etdim
It seems like a really easy job for me.	Bu meniň üçin hakykatdanam aňsat iş ýaly.
I tried it several times	Birnäçe gezek synap gördüm
That's all we need.	Bize zerur zat.
That highway must be something.	Şol uly ýol bir zat bolmaly.
She has to call another.	Oňa başga bir jaň etmeli.
I did some work for them	Men olar üçin birneme iş etdim
Now there were bigger things to worry about.	Indi alada etmeli has uly zatlar bardy.
I just didn’t see how	Diňe nädip görmedim
Maybe it’s not just money.	Belki, bu diňe pul däl.
Life can be so easy.	Durmuş şeýle aňsat bolup biler.
I didn't know it happened	Munuň bolandygyny bilmedim
I thought about it a lot.	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim.
I don't know now	Men häzir bilemok
And then the girl.	Soň bolsa gyz.
It may seem difficult to do so.	Muny etmek kyn ýaly bolup biler.
I'm glad to see you there	Men sizi ol ýerde görüp begenýärin
There was nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.
Happy.	Bagtly.
That will no longer be the case.	Mundan beýläk beýle bolmaz.
Here we are.	Ine, biz şu ýerde.
This can be fun.	Bu gyzykly bolup biler.
I really didn't know	Men hakykatdanam bilmedim
This is the reason and therefore.	Bu sebäp we şonuň üçin.
I still couldn't tell.	Men henizem aýdyp bilmedim.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
I was worried about you.	Men sen hakda alada etdim.
In fact, I haven't done anything yet	Aslynda entek hiç iş etmedim
Now it’s two and two.	Indi iki we iki boldy.
He is very human.	Ol gaty adam.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu iş boldy.
I thought he did it himself	Muny özi etdi öýdüpdim
The last mistake.	Iň soňky ýalňyşlyk.

There is work to be done here.	Bu ýerde iş bolýar.
This makes it impossible to exist anymore	Bu bolsa mundan beýläk bar bolmagy mümkin däl edýär
You have nothing to say.	Seniň aýdyp biljek zadyň ýok.
It happens here.	Bu ýerde bolýar.
I have something for you.	Meniň saňa bir zadym bar.
What am I going to do about it now?	Indi bu barada näme etjek?
I must.	Men hökman etmeli.
I told her I could do it, of course	Men oňa elbetde edip biljekdigini aýtdym
OK, you can do it now.	Bolýar, indi edip bilersiňiz.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda muny etmek bilen çynlakaý bir pikir edip bolar.
I know what he wants to do	Men onuň näme etmek isleýändigini bilýärin
This is still short.	Bu henizem gysga.
This will take care of you.	Bu siziň üçin alada eder.
I was not.	Men ýokdy.
It will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek.
I didn't want to think about them	Men olar hakda pikir etmek islemedim
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
I was almost alone there	Men ol ýerde ýeke diýen ýaly boldum
Work.	Iş.
It would be nice to do that.	Muny etmek gowy bolardy.
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
This makes them interesting.	Bu olar üçin gyzykly edýär.
I could not get it	Meni alyp bilmedim

They are every year.	Olar her ýyl.

This is not really a problem.	Bu hakykatdanam mesele däl.
For the first time	Ilkinji gezek
It makes you human.	Bu sizi adam edýär.

He said he didn't have to worry	Alada etmeli däl diýdi
The problem.	Mesele.

You have to be serious.	Çynlakaý bolmaly.
He never paid attention	Oňa hiç wagt üns bermedi
We have two	Ikimiz bar
He told her a lot.	Ol oňa köp zady aýtdy.
I can try it on myself.	Özümi synap görüp bilerin.
What he did was great.	Eden zady gaty gowy boldy.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
It works great.	Ajaýyp iş edýär.
He didn't want to think about it right now.	Ol edil häzir onuň hakda pikir etmek islemedi.
You have to destroy me and make me fast	Meni ýok etmeli we çalt etmeli
He stayed there.	Ol ýerde galdy.
We didn't need the money.	Bize pul gerek däldi.
I want to help you	Size kömek etmegini isleýärin
He could see it.	Ol muny görüp bilýärdi.
It's very interesting to do that.	Muny etmek gaty gyzykly.
He gave it to me.	Ol maňa berdi.
I trust you completely	Men saňa doly ynanýaryn
That should be great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp bolmaly.
Things are possible.	Bolýan zatlar mümkin.
I wonder how he could.	Nädip biljekdigine haýran.
I thought there was hope with him	Onuň bilen umyt bar diýip pikir etdim
Why left? 	Näme üçin galdy?
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Not like us.	Biz ýaly däl.
Maybe too much.	Belki gaty köp.
When, why and how to do it.	Haçan, näme üçin we nädip etmeli.
This is not an easy task	Bu aňsat iş däl
The decision was made.	Karar muny etdi.
A good man can never be a liar	Gowy adam hiç haçan ýalan bolup bilmez
This will not be true.	Bu dogry bolmaz.
I think something bad happened	Meniň pikirimçe erbet bir zat boldy
I'm ready for it.	Men muňa taýyn boldum.
She is happy now.	Ol häzir bagtly.
I don’t think he’s alone.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ýeke däl.
He is not.	Ol däl.
I'm so scared.	Men gaty gorkýaryn.
I'm scared.	Men gorkýaryn.
One cannot make any mistake today.	Adam häzirki wagtda hiç hili ýalňyşlyk edip bilmez.
In fact, this is often the case.	Aslynda, bu köplenç beýle däl.
I don't know who he is.	Kimiň bardygyny bilemok.
An interesting new challenge.	Gyzykly täze kynçylyk.
Not with the police.	Polisiýa bilen däl.
I did nothing for you.	Men saňa hiç zat etmedim.
Talk to someone.	Kimdir biri bilen gürleşmek.
I got it again.	Men ony ýene bir gezek aldym.
I can't go home	Men öýe gaýdyp bilemok
It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
You really don't have to do much about anything.	Hakykatdanam hiç zat hakda köp zat etmeli däl.
It takes time.	Munuň üçin wagt gerek.
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
Life is bad.	Durmuş bir erbet.
Not for that.	Munuň üçin däl.
He was very surprised.	Ol gaty geň galdy.
I got the money	Men pul aldym
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Still very close.	Entek gaty ýakyn.
No one did anything.	Hiç kim hiç zat etmedi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Diňe hiç zat ýok.
I never had to worry about it before	Mundan öň hiç wagt alada etmeli däldim
I don’t have to do it myself yet	Men entek özümi etmeli däl
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
I actually hoped it would make her happy	Aslynda ony bagtly eder diýip umyt etdim
He is no more.	Ol häzir ýok.

I can speak for myself	Men özüm üçin gürläp bilerin
I didn't even have to say that	Men muny hatda aýtmaly däldim
A long time ago.	Köp wagt mundan ozal.
I was with him for a week	Men onuň bilen bir hepde boldum
He never told me why he did that.	Ol näme üçin beýle edendigini maňa hiç wagt aýtmady.
I haven't done that yet	Men entek muny etmedim
I thought it would be good	Gowy bolar öýdüpdim
I don't want to hurt you that much	Men saňa beýle zyýan bermek islämok
I need a week.	Maňa bir hepde gerek.
I don’t even know what happened to him	Onuň bilen näme bolandygyny hatda bilemok
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilmez.
He did not ask another question.	Ol başga sorag bermedi.
I am a prisoner.	Men tussag.
Okay, tomorrow is a week.	Bolýar, ertir bir hepde.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
Not at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda däl.
They should be.	Olar bolmaly.
Always	Hemişe.
That sounds like a good idea to me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy pikir ýaly bolup görünýär.
I can't do that for you	Men muny seniň üçin edip bilemok
Not true yet.	Entek dogry däl.
Not really surprising.	Hakykatdanam geň däl.
It's just hard for us.	Bu diňe biziň üçin kyn.
"It simply came to our notice then.	" diýdi.
Talk to him.	Onuň bilen gürleşmek.
Nothing was the same as before.	Hiç zat öňküsi ýaly däldi.
We have to go	Biz gitmeli
What happened.	Näme boldy.
In fact, nothing.	Aslynda hiç zat ýok.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I couldn't tell him that.	Oňa muny aýdyp bilmedim.
This can be tried.	Muny synap bolar.
I thought about a lot of things at the time	Şol wagt gaty köp zat hakda pikir etdim
I was them.	Men olar boldum.
I just couldn't sleep	Men diňe uklap bilmedim
I didn't want to see you here	Men sizi bu ýerde görmek islemedim
Even a few days ago.	Hatda birnäçe gün ozal.
I'm so sorry for him.	Men oňa gaty gynanýaryn.
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
I have never seen anything like this before	Munuň ýaly zady öň görmedim
This is just a matter of time.	Bu diňe bir mesele.
I can do that for you	Men muny siziň üçin edip bilerin
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
Someone was somewhere.	Kimdir bir ýerde bardy.
I couldn’t even enjoy it	Men hatda lezzet alyp bilmedim
The same thing.	Şol bir zat.
No one told me that.	Hiç kim muny maňa aýtmady.
These things happened.	Bu zatlar boldy.
He said something else.	Başga bir zat diýdi.
Not much.	Kän däl.
She looked very young.	Ol gaty ýaş ýalydy.
I have to get it.	Men almaly.
It was not right, but it had to be done.	Bu dogry däldi, ýöne etmeli boldy.
It was like nothing.	Hiç zat ýaly däldi.
Something else is coming.	Başga bir zat gelýär.
I told you.	Men saňa aýtdym.
It's too bad.	Ol gaty erbet.
I caused it.	Men muňa sebäp boldum.
I'm sure there will be a weekend.	Geljek dynç güni boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
He thought it was strange.	Geň diýip pikir etdi.
He did not want to think about it.	Ol bu hakda pikir etmek islemedi.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
They were not very smart.	Olar gaty akylly däldi.
Three for one girl.	Bir gyz üçin üç.
That must be a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk bolmaly.
What is this	Bu näme.
He thought he was right.	Ol dogry aýtdy, diýip pikir etdi.
I was there last year	Men ol ýerde geçen ýyl boldum
There was no one else and no money.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy we pul ýokdy.
Now it is.	Indi şeýle.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
I could get these things	Men bu zatlary alyp bilýärdim
He has nothing.	Oňa hiç zat ýok.
He didn't have a hard time.	Onuň gaty kyn wagty ýokdy.
It would be nice to have him go.	Onuň gitmegi gowy bolar.
I have to stop doing that	Men muny etmegi bes etmeli
I didn't want to know anymore	Indi bilmek islemedim
I need it several times	Maňa birnäçe gezek gerek
You know, the big deal.	Bilýärsiň, uly mesele.
I was worried it wouldn't happen	Bolmaz diýip alada etdim
It's very interesting	Ol gaty gyzykly
It's weird, but it's there.	Bu geň, ýöne şol ýerde.
He was also worried.	Ol hem alada galdy.
I can try this again	Men muny ýene synap görüp bilerin
I think it's great.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ajaýyp.
I didn't know that.	Men muny bilmeýärdim.
Nothing happened.	Hiç zat ýokdy.
You have to do something good	Gowy zat bilen etmeli
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
I didn't do that.	Men beýle etmedim.
I could not answer and did not know	Men jogap berip bilmedim we bilmedim
He likes money.	Ol pul halaýar.
I just asked a question	Men diňe bir sorag berdim
Such a good guy	Şeýle gowy ýigit.
Is that so?	Ol şeýlemi?
I gave you this job.	Men saňa bu işi berdim.
He doesn't have to do that.	Ol muny etmeli däl.
I just wanted to do a good job	Diňe gowy iş etjek boldum
To do this.	Muny etmek üçin.
Something other than me.	Menden başga zat.

Everyone does that.	Hemmeler şeýle edýär.
Things you want to see.	Görmek isleýän zatlary.
She looks serious.	Ol çynlakaý görünýär.
I am happy for them.	Men olar üçin bagtly.
That's it.	Şol.
I don't think so	Kän zat däl öýdýän
This time.	Bu gezek.
This seems strange.	Bu geň görünýär.
Oh, he wanted that.	Aý, muny isledi.
This is new to him.	Bu onuň üçin täze.
Just like now	Edil häzirki ýaly.
It didn't happen, but it does.	Bolup bilmedi, ýöne şeýle.
He did so that night.	Şol gije şeýle etdi.
In fact, I haven't seen it in a while	Aslynda muny biraz wagt görmedim
He could still do it.	Ol henizem edip bilýärdi.
I know what he did to you	Onuň saňa näme edenini bilýärin
That's all there is to it.	Etmeli zady.
That's it.	Ine, şeýle.
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
I was there for a few days.	Men ol ýerde birnäçe gün boldum.
I'll do something for you.	Men seniň üçin bir zat ederin.
I thought it was great	Ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim
He has to do that to me.	Ol maňa muny etmeli.
Needless to say, now.	Indi hakykatdanam aýtmak hökman däl.
He doesn't like me either.	Ol hem meni halamaýar.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
How can this be.	Bu nähili bolup biler.
I can't see it anywhere	Men ony hiç ýerde görüp bilemok
It really helps.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek edýär.
I saw him this morning	Men ony şu gün irden gördüm
He didn't tell her anything bad.	Oňa bir erbet zat hakda aýtmady.
I'm still worried about him, but it's not	Men henizem onuň hakda alada edýärin, ýöne beýle däl
You don't have to decide now.	Indi karar bermek hökman däl.
may be	bolup biler.
I hope everyone can help.	Her kim kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
I've been with him for two years	Men onuň bilen iki ýyl boldum
It was a good day.	Gowy gün boldy.
This can be a long way off.	Bu uzak ýol bolup biler.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
Then another.	Soň ýene bir.
I never saw it	Hiç haçan görmedim
There is a reason for this	Munuň bir sebäbi bar
I had to do some very difficult things	Birneme gaty kyn zatlar etmeli boldum
I don't think it's possible.	Mümkin däl öýdemok.
He is a very good guy.	Ol gaty gowy ýigit.
Of course, this still needs work.	Elbetde, bu henizem işe mätäç.
There is a word.	Söz bar.
Somewhat strange.	Birneme geň.
I thought it would do great	Men muny gaty gowy eder öýdüpdim
I'm not going to do that	Men muny etjek däl
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
This is smart.	Bu akylly.

I was not at all surprised	Men asla geň görmedim
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I don't know what happened	Näme bolandygyny bilemok
I think maybe you can do that	Meniň pikirimçe, belki muny edip bilersiňiz
In fact, it doesn't take long.	Aslynda kän wagt gerek däl.
It will be.	Bu bolar.
I really didn't think so	Men hakykatdanam pikir etmedim
It may or may not happen.	Bolup biler, bolup bilmez.
I want to talk to you.	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
She is not a girl.	Ol gyz däl.
This morning	Şu gün irden.
We are against it.	Biz garşy.
He must have done something good	Gowy bir zat eden bolmaly

I found this very interesting	Muny gaty gyzykly gördüm
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
There will be no problem.	Hiç hili mesele bolmaz.
You are like me	Sen meniň ýaly.
I responded immediately	Men derrew jogap berdim
I know it's not true	Dogry däldigini bilýärin
I have something to do	Meniň etmeli zadym bar
Someone happened to me.	Biri maňa boldy.
He did that.	Bu zat etdi.
It already existed.	Bu öňem bardy.
No problem here.	Bu ýerde kynçylyk ýok.
I really know that	Men muny hakykatdanam bilýärin
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
Often he said "no".	Köplenç ol "ýok" diýdi.
I couldn’t think of the right answer	Dogry jogap hakda pikir edip bilmedim
Last but not least.	Iň soňky.
You have to help to help.	Kömek etmek üçin kömek etmeli.
Of course, I allowed it	Elbetde, oňa rugsat berdim
He knew he could give.	Berip biljekdigini bilýärdi.
I couldn't think of them	Men olar hakda pikir edip bilmedim

That would be too much.	Bu gaty köp bolardy.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
Many, many hours.	Köp, köp sagat.
That was never enough for me.	Meniň üçin bu hiç wagt ýeterlik däldi.
I was alone at the time	Men şol wagt ýeke boldum
There is no one else there.	Ol ýerde başga hiç kim ýok.
It was not life.	Bu durmuş däldi.
There was never a question about it.	Bu hakda hiç haçan sorag ýokdy.
It was really hard	Bu hakykatdanam kyn boldy
It takes a lot of money.	Munuň üçin köp pul gerek.
I immediately got one.	Men derrew birini aldym.

Of course it can.	Elbetde bolup biler.
I didn’t know it wasn’t	Men onuň däldigini bilmedim
And then.	Soň bolsa.
So there is no single answer to that.	Şonuň üçin munuň üçin ýekeje jogap ýok.
They were there too.	Olar hem bardy.
There were a number of issues.	Birnäçe mesele bardy.
I want an answer.	Jogap isleýärin.
This is difficult for them.	Bu olar üçin kyn.
I couldn’t be happier for someone	Men biri üçin has bagtly bolup bilmedim
I had to do it again	Men ony ýene meşgul etmeli boldum
I heard you for the first time	Men seni ilkinji gezek eşitdim
Today is the day to give.	Bu gün bermeli gün.

Until then, everything is fine.	Oňa çenli hemme zat gowy.
Just great, great, great.	Diňe ajaýyp, ajaýyp, ajaýyp.

This is better.	Bu has gowy.
I almost never saw it	Men muny görmedim diýen ýaly
I need to get closer.	Maňa has ýakyn gerek.
I think it takes a bit of work	Meniň pikirimçe, bu biraz iş gerek
He thinks about things.	Ol zatlar hakda pikir edýär.
It's very, very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn, gaty kyn.
I'm worried about that	Men muny biynjalyk edýärin
You don't have to worry	Alada etmeli däl
No sound at all.	Asla ses ýok.

Then do it again.	Soň bolsa ýene bir gezek et.
Everything looks good.	Hemme zat gowy görünýär.
It's about it.	Ol bu hakda.

I have to agree with him	Men onuň bilen razy bolmaly
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I did it for you	Men muny siziň üçin etdim
This is something new.	Bu täze bir zat.
This may be strange	Bu geň bolup biler

I didn't mean to offend you	Men muny aýtmak islemedim
I hope it comes back to haunt me soon	Diňe ýakyn wagtda özüne geler diýip umyt edýärin
That could be the right thing to do.	Bu dogry bir zat bolup biler.
This, of course, helps.	Bu, elbetde kömek edýär.
There is another issue.	Başga bir mesele bar.
So that’s something completely different.	Şonuň üçin bu düýbünden başga zat.
Until then.	Oňa çenli.

In fact, it is impossible.	Aslynda mümkin däl.
I'm sorry about that.	Men oňa gynanýaryn.

He just said he did a good job.	Ol diňe gowy iş etdi diýdi.

Man, you know that.	Adam, muny bilýärsiň.

I gave them almost everything	Hemmesini diýen ýaly berdim
She should be home now.	Ol häzir öýde bolmaly.

I have seen it and I have not seen it	Men muny gördüm we görmedim
There was no time to worry.	Bu barada alada etmäge wagt ýokdy.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
You really have to do that.	Siz hakykatdanam şeýle etmeli.

Many hours of fun.	Köp sagat hezil.
I'm just somewhere else	Men diňe başga bir ýerde
I just couldn’t take him home	Men ony diňe öýüne alyp gidip bilmedim
Girl, I asked you a question.	Gyz, saňa bir sorag berdim.

Not so today.	Bu gün beýle däl.

That was not the case for him.	Onuň üçin beýle däldi.
Right here.	Edil şu ýerde.
I hope this happens.	Bu bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
He gave way.	Ol bir ýol berdi.
I couldn't get it	Ony alyp bilmedim
There	Şol ýerde.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.

I didn’t think of anything or anyone	Men hiç zat ýa-da hiç kim hakda pikir etmedim
He can't go.	Ol gidip bilmeýär.
Every day and every day.	Her gün we her gün.
This is nothing new or strange.	Bu täze ýa-da geň zat däl.
This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
More than that.	Has köp zat.
This year was enough.	Bu ýyl ýeterlik boldy.

It will be good.	Gowy bolar.

It could be serious.	Çynlakaý bolup biler.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda muny alyp bilmeýär.
I don't think it's necessary	Zerur diýip pikir etmeýärin
I need something better	Maňa has gowy zat gerek
I thought about visiting there	Men ol ýere baryp görmek hakda pikir etdim
I have a few questions	Mende birnäçe sorag bar

He called and he called.	Jaň etdi we jaň etdi.
I have an idea.	Mende bir pikir bar.
I'm not like you	Men seniň ýaly däl
He is close here.	Ol şu ýerde ýakyn.
There is no one else.	Mundan başga hiç kim ýok.
In your opinion.	Siziň pikiriňizçe.
I think it was that night.	Meniň pikirimçe, şol gije boldy.
I think so	Bu şeýle diýip pikir edýärin
I can actually be good at that	Aslynda munuň üçin gowy bolup bilerin

Of course, I'm worried about that	Elbetde, men muňa alada edýärin

That should be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolmaly.
You can get it.	Siz ony alyp bilersiňiz.

He lives.	Ol ýaşaýar.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
I don't know how to do that	Muny nädip etmelidigimi bilemok
This is the only answer.	Bu ýeke-täk jogap.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
That's exactly what he does there.	Edil şol ýerde näme edýär.
He wanted it, and no wonder.	Ol muny isledi, hiç hili geň zat ýok.
Too short.	Gaty gysga.
It almost happened.	Bu diýen ýaly boldy.
I want to help you do that.	Muny etmäge kömek etmek isleýärin.
I am the right person	Men dogry adam
I am a bad person	Men erbet adam
I never saw you	Men seni asla görüp bilmedim
The police told me so.	Polisiýa maňa şeýle diýdi.
I could still see it	Men henizem ony görüp bilýärdim
Of course.	Elbetde.
In fact, he had known for months.	Aslynda, ol birnäçe aý bäri bilýärdi.

Only two were not difficult.	Diňe ikisi şonuň üçin kyn däldi.
She is beautiful, but she is crazy.	Ol owadan, ýöne däli.
Why did he do that?	Näme üçin beýle etdi?
This is just an idea.	Bu diňe pikir.
He did not cast a single vote	Ol ýekeje ses hem bermedi
I can't say what he wants	Men onuň näme isleýändigini aýdyp bilemok
Too fast for him.	Özi üçin gaty çalt.
It's not you	Bu sen däl
I heard about it later.	Bu barada soň eşitdim.

I have never tried it.	Hiç haçan synap görmedim.
There is time.	Wagt bar.
He took one.	Birini aldy.
I didn't know that	Men muny bilmedim
He was arrested.	Ony tussag etdi.
I don't know what he's doing.	Onuň näme edýändigini bilenok.
That should be easy enough.	Bu düýbünden aňsat bolmaly.
Talking to an adult.	Uly adam bilen gürleşmek.
There is no correct answer.	Dogry jogap ýok.
It will be several hours.	Bu birnäçe sagat bolar.
She was worried.	Ony biynjalyk etdi.
This is still difficult.	Bu henizem kyn.
I really don't believe it	Men hakykatdanam ynanamok
Anyone can see this.	Muny her kim görüp biler.
Also, this may not be good.	Şeýle hem, bu gowy bolup bilmez.
So I need it.	Şonuň üçin maňa gerek.
We need help and urgency.	Bize kömek we çalt gerek.
A few years ago.	Birnäçe ýyl ozal.
Actually like you.	Aslynda seniň ýaly.
I have a big problem.	Mende uly mesele bar.
It was great.	Gaty gowy boldy.
I have a lot of doubts about that.	Men muňa gaty şübhelenýärin.

That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
I have given you what you need	Size zerur zatlary berdim
I hope so.	Elbetde şeýle bolar diýip umyt edýärin.

It could be.	Bolup biler.
It will be good	Gowy bolar
I'm older now	Men häzir has uly adam
I had to call twice.	Iki gezek jaň etmeli boldum.
No one can.	Hiç kim edip bilmez.
Next month will be another one.	Geljek aý başga biri bolar.
Good.	Gowy.
I really don't hope so	Men hakykatdanam umyt etmeýärin
I never do that	Men hiç wagt beýle zatlary etmeýärin
In fact, more.	Aslynda has köp.
Maybe you shouldn't.	Belki etmeli däl.
I can't do that	Men muny edip bilemok
You know	Bilýärsiň.
I saw that he was never alone	Men onuň hiç haçan ýeke däldigini gördüm
What a week.	Näme hepde.
He knows this well.	Ol muny gowy bilýär.
I didn't have to tell him	Men oňa aýtmaly däldim
Isn't that right?	Şeýle dälmi?
I really don't think so	Men hakykatdanam hiç wagt pikir etmeýärin
I'm sorry about that	Men muňa gynanýaryn
It's still very close.	Bu henizem gaty ýakyn bir zat.
He must have known.	Ol bilýän bolmaly.
Now I have to do something	Indi bir zat etmeli boldum
What a way.	Nähili ýol.
I haven't tried it yet.	Men entek synap görmedim.
It wasn’t fun, but then life didn’t have to be that fun.	Bu gyzykly däldi, ýöne soň durmuş beýle gyzykly bolmaly däldi.
I never did that.	Men asla beýle etmedim.
I do not know.	Men bilemok.
He asked me for money.	Ol menden pul sorady.
I have to get it.	Men ony almaly.
I didn't really think about it	Men hakykatdanam bu hakda pikir etmedim
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
It seems like a good idea.	Maňa gowy zatlar ýaly bolup görünýär.
I don't know what will happen next.	Indiki näme boljakdygyny bilemok.
He just has to do it.	Ol diňe etmeli.
Today is the day	Bu gün gün.
I couldn't get the right answer	Dogry jogap alyp bilmedim
What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Bu nähili ajaýyp!.
Not immediately.	Derrew däl.
Right now he had something to do.	Edil häzirki wagtda onuň etmeli işi bardy.
It may take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek bolup biler.
I just had to go and do it myself	Diňe gidip, özüm etmeli boldum
And then there will be more.	Soň bolsa has köp bolar.
I didn't know that.	Men muny bilmeýärdim.
So are they.	Olar hem şeýle.
No one knows what to do about it.	Hiç kim munuň näme etmelidigini bilenok.
Of course, that was not the case.	Elbetde, bu dogry däldi.
You have to pay attention.	Üns bermeli.
I already had enough money	Mende eýýäm ýeterlik pul bardy
Let me tell you - it was a scary place.	Muny size aýdyp bilerin, gowy bolmaz.
I have a lot.	Mende köp.
I think this is more likely	Meniň pikirimçe, bu has ähtimal
He told me he would take care of me.	Ol maňa alada etjekdigini aýtdy.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bu barada ýalňyşlyk ýok.
This is great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy.
Just more questions.	Diňe has köp sorag.
I want to go with him	Men onuň bilen gitmek isleýärin

Of course not.	Elbetde däl.
I can't try everything !.	Hemme zady synap görüp bilemok!.
He doesn't do that.	Ol beýle zat etmeýär.

Here's what's going on right now.	Ine, şu wagt näme bolýar.
It was a big deal at the time.	Şol wagt gaty uly mesele boldy.
If anything, I'm here	Bir zat gerek bolsa, men şu ýerde

This is strange.	Bu geň.
Today was another day.	Bu gün başga bir gün boldy.
I want to see you happy	Men sizi bagtly görmek isleýärin
I am really a prisoner	Men hakykatdanam tussag
I heard you very well	Men seni gaty gowy eşitdim

Nothing this year.	Bu ýyl hiç zat.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Not completely needed	Doly gerek däl
Good guy	Gowy ýigit.
Everywhere, doing something.	Her ýerde, bir zat etmek.

Maybe not surprisingly.	Belki geň zat däl.
There must be one, of course.	Elbetde, biri bolmaly.

It does.	Şeýle edýär.
He was well aware of this.	Ol muny gowy bilýärdi.

That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
I am alone.	Diňe özüm bar.
You don't have to be like them.	Olar ýaly, olar ýaly bolmak hökman däl.
I was not good enough to do anything bad	Erbet bir zat etmek üçin ýeterlik däldim
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
There was no one.	Hiç kim ýokdy.
I am already very busy today	Men şu gün eýýäm gaty meşgul boldum
Damage.	Zyýan.
I haven't seen anyone yet	Men henizem hiç kimi görüp bilmedim
I'm very bad	Mende gaty erbet
I heard you there.	Men seni ol ýerde eşitdim.
I knew what he wanted.	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärdim.
He knows that.	Ol muny bilýär.
Maybe it will disappear.	Belki ýok bolar.
Stop worrying too much about me.	Men hakda gaty köp alada etmegi bes et.
I had to help you	Men size kömek etmeli boldum
I don't need that.	Maňa beýle gerek däl.
Not necessarily.	Hökman däl.
I can get more work.	Men has köp iş alyp bilerin.
I didn't expect that	Men muňa umyt etmedim
Good girl	Gowy gyz.
I have never seen anything like it	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim
I didn't need anyone	Maňa hiç kim gerek däldi
He did not want to leave.	Ol gitmek islemedi.
I'd like to try this on	Muny synap görmek isleýärin
No book is easy.	Hiç bir kitap aňsat däl.
Is that so?	Bu şeýlemi?
Maybe this is something else for you.	Belki, bu siziň üçin başga zat.
Time is what you need right now.	Wagt şu wagt size gerek zat.
This is not really surprising.	Bu hakykatdanam geň däl.
I am still for you	Men henizem seniň üçin
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I knew he was going to do it	Men muny etjekdigini bilýärdim
He told her everything.	Ol oňa hemme zady aýtdy.
I didn't think otherwise	Başga pikir etmedim
I couldn't do it now	Häzir edip bilmedim
I called in a bad time.	Erbet wagtda jaň etdim.
You don't have to think that way.	Beýle pikir etmeli däl.
It was not easy either.	Bu hem aňsat däldi.
I was not fast enough	Men ýeterlik çalt däldim
I am so easy.	Men beýle aňsat.
It was like weeks and weeks.	Birnäçe hepde we hepde ýaly boldy.
I was not for him.	Men onuň üçin däldim.
You have to do better at home.	Öýde has gowy iş etmeli.
This is an interesting thing.	Bu gyzykly bir zat.
So here we are.	Şonuň üçin biz şu ýerde.
It seemed like more.	Bu has köp ýalydy.
I couldn't do that to you	Men muny saňa edip bilmedim
I can do it.	Mümkin edip bilerin.
There was always another problem.	Elmydama başga bir kynçylyk bardy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, biz däl.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
We will never know.	Biz hiç haçan bilmeris.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I didn't see him anywhere	Men ony hiç ýerde görmedim
??.	??.
I knew it would do	Munuň etjekdigini bilýärdim
I have been here for two days	Men bu ýerde iki gün boldum
We can never go.	Hiç wagt gidip bilmeris.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
Must be fast.	Çalt bolmaly.
He was here, and then he was there.	Ol şu ýerde, soň bolsa şol ýerde boldy.
What was there.	Ol ýerde näme bardy.
I didn’t want to go and see things.	Men gidip zatlary görmek islemedim.
He could not help me.	Ol maňa kömek edip bilmedi.
There were still a few hours.	Entek birnäçe sagat bardy.
This is not interesting.	Bu gyzykly däl.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
Just an idea.	Diňe bir pikir.
Everything happens twice.	Hemme zat iki gezek bar.
I can't tell him what he did	Men oňa näme edenini aýdyp bilemok
I had to tell you that	Men saňa muny aýtmaly boldum
I can't say enough good things about them	Men olar hakda ýeterlik gowy zat aýdyp biljek däl
You need	Size gerek.
It really doesn't exist.	Ol hakykatdanam ýok.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
I have no idea	Mende ýok diýen pikir bar
I'm not anywhere	Men hiç ýerde däl
I think he will help me	Ol maňa kömek eder öýdýärin
I had no money	Mende pul ýokdy
I can go there.	Men ol ýere baryp bilerin.
Sorry, but many times.	Bagyşlaň, ýöne köp gezek.
This is not possible	Bu mümkin däl
I have to go to work	Men işe gitmeli
There was another.	Başga biri bardy.
I haven't seen it before	Men ozal görmedim
I'm sure he can tell you about those things	Ol saňa şol zatlar hakda aýdyp biljekdigine ynanýaryn
You can see it here.	Muny şu ýerde görüp bilersiňiz.
In fact, the two of us were almost there.	Aslynda, ikimiz diýen ýalydy.
It can be very fast now.	Indi gaty çalt bolup biler.
These are very interesting things.	Bu gaty gyzykly zatlar.
I think this is a mistake.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýalňyşlyk.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
I want good and bad.	Gowy we erbet zady isleýärin.
He could not help himself.	Ol özüne kömek edip bilmedi.
I take it seriously	Men ol hakda çynlakaý alada edýärin
That would be good news.	Bu gowy habar bolar.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
I don't know anything	Men hiç zady bilemok
I knew it was going to happen	Munuň boljakdygyny bilýärdim
I wanted to help you	Men size kömek etjek boldum
It has to be a new word.	Bu täze söz bolmaly.
In fact, he did.	Aslynda şeýle etdi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He didn't want to.	Ol gaty islemedi.
I couldn't do anything else	Başga bir zat edip bilmedim
This is exactly the style of governing the country that he has used in Russia.	Bu edil häzirki wagtda.
Of course, they are not ready now.	Elbetde, olar häzir taýyn däl.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
A lot of fun.	Köp gyzykly.
It can be very fast.	Bu gaty çalt bolup biler.
It was night.	Bu gije boldy.
Maybe something else.	Belki başga bir zat bolup biler.
Here, man.	Ine, adam.
I have no problem.	Mende hiç hili mesele ýok.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu gaty ähtimal däl ýaly.
He didn't say anything.	Oňa hiç zat aýtmady.
I thought it would be harder	Has kyn bolar öýdüpdim
Of course girl.	Elbetde gyz.
It's really easy to do that.	Muny etmek hakykatdanam aňsat.
He did not know.	Ol bilmeýärdi.
Very good everywhere.	Hemme ýerde gaty gowy.
Okay, maybe that won't be too hard.	Bolýar, belki bu gaty kyn bolmaz.
He doesn't want to.	Ol islemeýär.
I must have seen it	Men muny gören bolmaly
Definitely beautiful.	Elbetde owadan.
I had to tell him more	Men oňa has köp zat aýtmaly boldum
I did it right	Dogry etdim
This will not be true.	Bu dogry bolmaz.
How much would that be?	Bu näçe iş bolardy.
Must do.	Etmeli.
He had nothing	Oňa düýbünden hiç zat ýokdy
I can't do that, you know.	Muny edip bilemok, bilýärsiň.
Really thinking about it.	Hakykatdanam bu hakda pikir etmek.
He is a man, but we are not against him.	Ol adam, ýöne biz oňa garşy däl.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
I promised him	Men oňa söz berdim
I can't think	Pikir edip bilemok
She was amazed.	Ol muňa haýran galdy.
Maybe a girl.	Bir gyz belki.
I told her this was not the case.	Men oňa munuň zerur däldigini aýtdym.
This is a wonderful thing.	Bu düýbünden ajaýyp zat.
Then it was two.	Soň iki boldy.
He is now.	Ol şu wagt.
Maybe I don't like it	Belki halamok
He didn't think so.	Ol beýle pikir etmedi.
Needless to say, it will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolup bilmejekdigini aýtmaly däl.
I am absolutely stupid.	Men düýbünden samsyk.
The same can be said now.	Häzir edil şonuň ýaly bolup biler.
Something about him made me look like a guy.	Ol hakda bir zat meni ýigit ýaly etdi.
It's been a long time coming.	Hakykatdanam gaty uzak wagt.
I think we can do that	Muny edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin
Most days	Iň köp gün
Not everyone did.	Hemmeler etmedi.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
How wonderful is this?	Bu nähili ajaýyp?
I think it's great	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ajaýyp
He didn't have to answer to anyone.	Ol hiç kime jogap bermeli däldi.
I was not ready for that	Men muňa taýyn däldim
He did it all.	Ol hemmesini etdi.
I think you can be right	Dogry aýdyp bilersiňiz öýdýän
No work is long.	Hiç bir iş uzak däl.
I let him go with me.	Özüm bilen gitmäge rugsat berdim.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I don’t think they are right for me.	Olar meniň üçin dogry däl öýdemok.
Now I know this is not the case	Munuň beýle däldigini indi bilýärin
I wondered when someone came here the last time	Kimdir biri bu ýere soňky gezek haçan geldi diýip pikir etdim
He did not want to see her again.	Mundan beýläk görmek islemedi.
Everyone could see that	Muny her kim görüp bilýärdi
I thought she was beautiful.	Men owadan diýip pikir etdim.
He is just like me.	Ol edil meniň ýaly.
It must be interesting to be that person.	Şol adam bolmak gyzykly bolmaly.
It's really hard.	Hakykatdanam gaty kyn.
I have never seen anything like them	Men olar ýaly zady görmedim
It's just us.	Bu diňe biz.
I'm so stupid	Men şeýle bir samsyk
The next question.	Indiki sorag.
I just can’t be good this year, I can’t even be great	Bu ýyl diňe gowy bolup bilemok, hatda ajaýyp hem bolup bilemok
So much for that.	Munuň üçin köp zat.
I tried this, but it didn't work.	Muny synap gördüm, ýöne hiç zat etmedi.
In fact, that's a lot.	Aslynda bu gaty köp.
It was good with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy boldy.
I couldn't get it	Men ony alyp bilmedim
I'm serious.	Men çynlakaý.
There are two ideas left.	Iki pikir galdy.
You are more	Siz has köp
What a strange question.	Nähili geň sorag.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
I would never do such a thing	Men hiç haçan beýle zatlary etjek däldim
Of course not.	Elbetde adam däl.
No problem.	Mesele bolmaz.
I have to be with him	Men onuň bilen bolmaly
Maybe only one person.	Belki diňe bir adam.
I have something full	Mende doly zat bar
I haven't been there in a while	Biraz wagt ol ýerde däldim
I do this for you	Men muny siziň üçin edýärin
There was no sound at all.	Asla ses ýokdy.
It will not be difficult.	Bu kyn bolmaz.
And the girl.	Gyz hem.
I thought it would be here	Men şu ýerde bolar öýdüpdim
I can definitely do that	Men muny hökman edip bilerin
I do this to make it interesting.	Muny gyzykly etmek üçin edýärin.
I knew these things together	Bilelikde bu zatlary bilýärdim
I was not such a guy	Men beýle ýigit däldim
He could not go home.	Ol öýe baryp bilmedi.
You have to worry about something.	Bir zat hakda alada etmeli.
Now it would be something !.	Indi bu bir zat bolardy!.
She is really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
They are always alone.	Olar elmydama ýeke.
So the problem is false.	Şonuň üçin mesele ýalan.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Hakykatdanam häzirki wagtda şeýle.
I really enjoyed it	Mundan gaty bir lezzet aldym
He was surprised and surprised.	Ol geň galdy we geň galdy.
Like one day.	Bir gün ýaly.
You don't have to do anything.	Hiç zat etmeli bolmaz.
I couldn't be happier anywhere else	Başga bir ýerde bagtly bolup bilmedim
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
You can try this.	Muny synap görüp bilersiňiz.
A short, happy voice	Gysga, bagtly ses
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
A lot of fun.	Köp gyzykly.
I told you it was a job	Saňa aýtdym, bu bir iş
I did, I did.	Etdim, men etdim.
There must be a reason for that.	Şonuň üçin bir sebäp bolmaly.
I do that.	Men muny edýärin.
I seriously doubt it.	Men çynlakaý şübhelenýärin.
There is no hope.	Umyt ýok.
I can't say that	Men muny aýdyp biljek däl
I don't care so much	Men beýle alada etmeýärin
I think that was good.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy boldy.
I just had to get it	Men diňe almaly boldum
This guy did whatever he wanted.	Bu ýigit islän zadyny etdi.
There is something everywhere.	Her ýerde bir zat bar.
The police came here.	Polisiýa bu ýere geldi.
Who do you think?	Siziň pikiriňizçe kim?
This has happened three times.	Üç gezek şeýle boldy.
I really want to.	Men hakykatdanam isleýärin.
I'm not there anymore	Men indi ol ýerde däl
Not so.	Beýle däl.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
I had another idea	Mende başga pikir bardy
Of course, nothing else.	Elbetde, başga bir zat ýok.
I just want to talk to you	Men diňe siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
Of course.	Elbetde.
It may have happened once.	Bir gezek bolup geçen bolmagy mümkin.
You can just enjoy it.	Diňe lezzet alyp bilersiňiz.
I didn't know about you	Men sen hakda bilmeýärdim
You may be right.	Dogry aýdyp bilersiňiz.
Really necessary.	Hakykatdanam zerur.
I didn't see anything	Men hiç zat görmedim
I need a loan.	Karz gerek.
because it must be so.	sebäbi şeýle bolmaly.
I think it exists now.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol häzir bar.
He will return home this weekend.	Ol şu dynç güni öýüne geler.
There is only one possibility.	Diňe bir mümkinçilik bar.
I have never seen anything so bad.	Mende hiç haçan erbet zat görmedim.
He may be right.	Dogry aýdyp biler.
I just want to be with myself	Men diňe özüm bilen bolmak isleýärin
It could be something.	Ol bir zat diýen bolmagy mümkin.
I don't want you	Men seni islämok
You don't have to know that	Muny bilmek hökman däl
Of course after me !.	Menden soň elbetde !.
Not really much.	Aslynda kän zat ýok.
So you have to decide for yourself.	Şonuň üçin özüňiz karar bermeli.
He is the same person.	Ol şol bir adam.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
You can tell right away.	Derrew aýdyp bilersiňiz.
I can do it tomorrow	Ertir edip bilerin
It would be great.	Gaty gowy bolardy.
He could not.	Ol edip bilmedi.
Thought tomorrow.	Ertir pikir etdi.
Everything is new here.	Bu ýerde hemme zat täze.
Probably.	Mümkin.
I think that's a good idea.	Bu gaty gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin.
This is worse.	Bu has erbet.
He is a man.	Ol adam.
I can see that now.	Men muny indi görüp bilýärin.
It will be.	Bu bolar.
I didn’t want to do any of that	Men munuň hiç birini etmek islemedim
I think it looks really good	Hakykatdanam gowy görünýär öýdýän
The time is too short.	Wagt gaty gysga.
This is serious.	Bu çynlakaý.
I called again	Men ýene bir gezek jaň etdim
I do not have and will not	Mende ýok we bolmaz
It's hard to see you now	Men seni indi görmek kyn
It's really big.	Aslynda gaty uly.

I am very happy	Men gaty bagtly
I've had enough	Men ýeterlik boldum
You are too fast to leave	Sen gitmäge gaty çalt
I think he can do whatever he wants	Islän zadyny edip biler diýip pikir edýärin
I didn't want to go with them	Men olar bilen gitmek islemedim
This can never happen.	Bu asla bolup bilmez.
It's not like I stopped thinking about it	Men ol hakda pikir etmegi bes eden ýaly däl
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
I hadn’t worried about that before	Men ozal bu barada alada etmedim
Stupid, but he was there.	Samsyk, ýöne ol ýerde bardy.
They are good together.	Olar bilelikde gowy.
It was possible to answer a few.	Birnäçe jogap bermek mümkin boldy.
See, but then no one knows.	Görmek, ýöne soň hiç kim bilenok.
I agree with that	Men muňa razy boldum
Why not? 	Näme üçin beýle däl?
It turned out really well.	Hakykatdanam gowy çykdy.
It takes two people	Iki adam gerek
He thought there must be another way.	Başga bir ýol bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
It shouldn't be, but it's okay, man.	Bolmaly däl, ýöne bolýar, adam.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Edil şonuň ýaly zerur zat.
He got a new life.	Täze durmuş aldy.
She is so beautiful.	Ol şeýle ajaýyp.
No one is happy.	Hiç kim bagtly däl.
It wasn’t fun anymore, it was crazy.	Indi hezil däldi, däli boldy.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
I want to be something	Men bir zat bolmak isleýärin
Not now, not tomorrow.	Indi däl, ertir däl.
I couldn't help it	Men oňa kömek edip bilmedim
Must be fast.	Çalt bolmaly.
I know, he thought.	Bilýärin, diýip pikir etdi.
I think that time has come	Meniň pikirimçe, ol wagt geldi diýip pikir etdi
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Complete destruction is impossible.	Doly ýok etmek mümkin däl.
He immediately understood.	Ol derrew düşündi.
I can see everything	Men hemme zady görüp bilýärin
I think you should give it to him	Meniň pikirimçe, oňa bermeli
I couldn't help it.	Kömek edip bilmedim.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
I really hope that doesn't happen	Aslynda beýle bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin
Being somewhere.	Bir ýerde bolmak.
I could not bear to worry	Alada etjek bolup bilmedim
I think the same thing could happen now	Meniň pikirimçe, häzirki wagtda şol bir zat bolup biler
I think about it every day	Men ol hakda her gün pikir edýärin
I really need it	Maňa gaty gerek
They are no more.	Indi olar ýok.
The next few weeks.	Indiki birnäçe hepde.
Not with you	Seniň bilen däl.
You have to do something else	Başga birini etmeli
He did not lend.	Karz bermedi.
He knew everything.	Ol hemme zady bilýärdi.
It took me to you.	Bu meni size alyp gitdi.
The next thing.	Indiki zat.
This is life.	Bu durmuş.
He informed her.	Ol oňa habar berdi.
This is very likely to be the case.	Munuň şeýle bolmagy gaty ähtimal.
If you need something, I'll be there.	Size bir zat gerek bolsa, men şol ýerde bolaryn.
I could not answer with words	Men söz bilen jogap berip bilmedim
I was bad.	Erbet boldum.
I didn't do anything to you last night.	Düýn agşam seni hiç zat etmedim.
I know he'll be here	Onuň şu ýerde boljakdygyny bilýärin
please	haýyş edýärin.
I had to buy time	Wagt satyn almaly boldum
I don’t even know how that happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny hatda bilemok.
I will destroy you for this	Munuň üçin seni ýok ederin
I couldn't do it alone	Men muny ýeke edip bilmedim
I think this will be a great thing	Bu gaty gowy zat bolar diýip pikir edýärin
Everywhere.	Her ýerde.
I responded immediately	Men derrew jogap berdim
Just to see.	Diňe görmek üçin.
Serious about how everyone can be right.	Her kimiň nädip dogry bolup biljekdigine çynlakaý.
Where there is, but verbally.	Nirä bar, ýöne söz bilen.
I think it's good for something	Bir zat üçin gowy diýip pikir edýärin
There was something interesting about the whole thing.	Bütin iş hakda gyzykly bir zat bardy.
So he came here for something else.	Şonuň üçin ol başga bir zat üçin şu ýere geldi.
I didn't want to talk about them	Men olar hakda gürleşmek islemedim
I can't see yet	Men entek görüp bilemok
No one knew better than that.	Hiç kim mundan gowy bilmeýärdi.
Someone comes to you if you need advice.	Kimdir biri maslahat gerek bolsa, saňa gelýär.
I can be hard	Men kyn bolup bilerin
It's over now.	Bu indi boldy.
This is not new either.	Bu hem täze däl.
No one else is me.	Başga hiç kim men däl.
I think you can do worse	Has erbet edip bilersiňiz öýdýän
It looks serious, but it's not.	Çynlakaý görünýär, ýöne aslynda beýle däl.
You have to make the right decision	Dogry karar bermeli
It's very difficult.	Gaty kyn.
I think it was good	Gowy boldy diýip pikir edýärin
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
I heard about it later	Bu hakda soň eşitdim
He will take care of you.	Ol sizi alada eder.
It was here before.	Bu ýerde öňem bardy.
Probably not.	Belki, ýok.
I do everything wrong	Men hemme zady erbet edýärin
It seemed like a great idea at the time.	Şol wagt gaty gowy pikir ýalydy.
He has not yet responded.	Ol henizem jogap bermedi.
That can't be the case.	Bu kän bir ýaly bolup bilmez.
I don't want a problem here	Men bu ýerde kynçylyk islämok
How beautiful is this?	Bu nähili owadan?
You might think this is not so bad.	Munuň beýle erbet däldigini pikir edip bilersiňiz.
He couldn't sleep that night.	Şol gije uklap bilmedi.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
Because it was not very difficult before.	Sebäbi öňem gaty kyn däldi.
I can tell there.	Men ol ýerde aýdyp bilerin.
I love it so much.	Men gaty gowy görüp bilýärin.
I told him myself.	Men oňa özüm aýtdym.
Three days later a full song came out	Üç gün soň doly aýdym çykdy
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
This is certainly true.	Bu elbetde dogry.
I couldn't see it anywhere	Men ony hiç ýerde görüp bilmedim
I hope you will.	Bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin.
And every year a lot of people do that.	Her ýyl bolsa köp adam muny edýär.
A lot of time.	Wagt köp.
I know why he did that.	Näme üçin beýle edendigini bilýärin.
I did it for him	Men oňa şeýle etdim
I didn't know that	Men bu hakda bilmeýärdim
He can talk.	Ol gürläp biler.
We are only for you today.	Biz şu gün diňe siziň üçin.
It was fast.	Bu çalt boldy.
Of course, it will be better now.	Elbetde, indi has gowy bolar.
That's it.	Edil şu.
There is only one way to get this thing.	Bu zady almak üçin ýekeje mümkinçilik bar.
I do more now	Men häzir has köp zat edýärin
I didn't see that.	Men muny görmedim.
I was just stupid	Men diňe samsyk boldum
He would be a wise man	Akylly adam bolardy
I don't believe he will do it	Men onuň muny etjekdigine ynanamok
He wants something.	Bir zat isleýär.
I can't do everything the same as before	Hemme zady öňküsi ýaly edip bilemok
I was completely alone	Men düýbünden ýeke boldum
This is really possible.	Hakykatdanam bu mümkin.
He actually lives here.	Aslynda bu ýerde ýaşaýar.
For a while	Biraz wagt.
I called a few nights ago	Birnäçe gije mundan ozal jaň etdim
I was not stupid.	Men samsyk däldim.
I know you have	Seniň bardygyny bilýärin
I can't do everything	Men hemme zady edip bilemok
Now i have you	Indi sen mende bar.
Why is it so late?	Näme üçin beýle gijä galdy?
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
I found it interesting	Men muny gyzykly gördüm
Which ones.	Olar haýsy.
I can never go back with him	Men onuň bilen hiç haçan gaýdyp bilemok
I can't tell you anything else	Men saňa başga zat aýdyp bilemok
He hasn't arrived yet.	Ol henizem gelenok.
This is an offer.	Bu teklip.
I can decide now	Men indi karar berip bilerin
I need it tonight	Maňa şu gije gerek bolar
I think it would be great	Ajaýyp bolardy diýip pikir edýärin
I saw what he was doing.	Men onuň näme edýändigini gördüm.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
I didn't do that	Men beýle zady etmedim
This is often not the case.	Bu köplenç beýle däl.
He knows, he wants.	Bilýär, isleýär.
Maybe this morning.	Belki şu gün irden.
I can see that now.	Men muny indi görüp bilýärin.
I thought it was great	Bu gaty gowy diýip pikir etdim
This was not an easy task	Bu aňsat iş däldi
And then he took it away.	Soň bolsa alyp gitdi.
I think it was closer	Has ýakyn boldy diýip pikir edýärin
He doesn't want to know.	Ol bilmek islemeýär.
He had help, and that's a lot.	Oňa kömek bardy, bu köp zat.
A guy who often wants.	Köplenç isleýän ýigit.
More interesting, more difficult work.	Has gyzykly, has kyn iş.
I knew he wasn't thinking about it	Men onuň hakda pikir etmeýändigini bilýärdim
He did not want to go there.	Ol ol ýere gitmek islemedi.
Not only is this not the case here.	Diňe şu ýerde däl ýaly däl.
I can't do that	Men muny edip bilemok
Someone is there.	Kimdir biri ol ýerde.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I couldn't see it that way	Men ony beýle görüp bilmedim
He knew it wasn't going to happen.	Munuň beýle däldigini bilýärdi.
I never wanted to hurt you	Men hiç haçan saňa zyýan bermek islemedim
This is not a big deal.	Bu hakykatdanam uly mesele däl.
I already knew that	Men muny öňem bilýärdim
Working hours	Iş wagty
He cannot be arrested.	Ony tussag edip bolmaz.
I can't see what he's thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini görüp bilemok
So it should be with everyone.	Şonuň üçin hemmeler bilen bolmaly.
I didn't see him anywhere that day	Şol gün men ony hiç ýerde görmedim
The same is true for this person.	Bu adam üçin hem edil şonuň ýaly.
Everything is there.	Bar zat bar.
This can be really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet bolup biler.
I thought what happened	Näme boldy diýip pikir etdim
I'm serious.	Men çynlakaý.
This will not be easy.	Bu aňsat zat bolmaz.
Reason or not.	Sebäp ýa-da ýok.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I just can't do what everyone wants	Her kimiň diňe isleýän zadyny edip bilemok
This is not just a word.	Bu diňe bir söz däl.
It will be a long night.	Uzak gije bolar.
I can try you	Men sizi synap görüp bilerin
I'm not good enough to do that.	Men muny etmek üçin ýeterlik däl.
There and then.	Ol ýerde we soň.
It really is.	Hakykatdanam şeýle.
I didn't think about it	Men bu barada pikir etmedim
Not everyone can do that.	Hemmeler muny edip bilenok.
The sound was strange.	Ses geň galdy.
You have to do something else.	Başga bir zat etmeli.
Maybe I am.	Mümkin men.
All that was left was enough.	Diňe ýeterlik zat galdy.
And then more.	Soň bolsa has köp.
That's it.	Ol şol.
I know no one cares about me	Hiç kimiň meniň hakda pikir etmeýändigini bilýärin
I did not propose.	Men teklip etmedim.
It's really hard to say.	Söz bilen aýtmak hakykatdanam kyn.
In fact for a long time	Aslynda köp wagt
I cared for him	Men onuň üçin alada etdim
I have a quick question	Mende çalt sorag bar
Three and three.	Üç we üç.
So both are correct.	Şonuň üçin ikisi hem dogry.
It makes you human.	Seni adam edýär.
We are like everyone else.	Biz hemmeler ýaly.
He had not been here for some time.	Ol bu ýerde birnäçe wagt bäri ýokdy.
Not complete.	Doly däl.
I have enough to do.	Etmeli zadym ýeterlik.
Because you know better.	Sebäbi sen gowy bilýärsiň.
He was late.	Ol gijä galdy.
He must have done that.	Muny eden bolmaly.
I had to go	Men gitmeli boldum
You must be crazy.	Sen däli bolmaly.
Now I know what to do	Indi näme etmelidigimi bilýärin
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, görmek gyzykly zat.
You have what you want	Seniň isleýän zadyň bar
He did not want to think about it.	Ol bu hakda pikir etmek islemedi.
I have to worry about things	Men zatlar hakda alada etmeli
Of course I believe and I think so.	Elbetde ynanýaryn we şeýle pikir edýärin.
So he was not going to help.	Şonuň üçin ol kömek etjek däldi.
Of course you know something.	Elbetde, bir zady bilýärsiň.
This is a complete lie.	Bu düýbünden ýalan.
I didn’t have to say that because it wasn’t right	Muny aýtmaly däldim, sebäbi bu dogry däl
Things are big these days.	Häzirki wagtda zatlar uly.
I let him	Men oňa ýol berdim
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
Great for tonight.	Bu gije üçin ajaýyp.
I saw and heard everything	Men hemme zady gördüm we eşitdim
The offer is a little late.	Teklip biraz gijä galdy.
You have to take a lot.	Köp zat almaly.
I want to talk to you	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
I can get it from you	Men ony senden alyp bilerin
I hope nothing more is needed.	Mundan başga hiç zat gerek bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
That's all you need.	Bu size gerek zat.
I'll do it myself.	Muny özüm ederin.
He did not know how this could happen, but he did know.	Munuň nädip bolup biljekdigini bilmeýärdi, ýöne bilýärdi.
What happened.	Näme boldy.
I never thought this would happen	Munuň beýle boljakdygyny asla pikir etmedim
I knew something was wrong	Bir zadyň dogry däldigini bilýärdim
Not everyone is like you.	Hemmeler seniň ýaly däl.
Many people left.	Köp adam gitdi.
Of course I can and will.	Elbetde edip bilerin we ederin.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
I often thought about it.	Men bu hakda köplenç pikir etdim.
I didn't see it that badly.	Men muny beýle erbet görmedim.
I am here	Men şu ýerde
It's very easy to do that.	Muny etmek gaty aňsat.
Better man	Has gowy adam.
Here are a few.	Ine birnäçe.
A lot of noise.	Köp ses.
There was something very strange about him.	Ol hakda gaty geň bir zat bardy.
I don't care.	Men alada etmeýärin.
It just seems so hard and so much work.	Diňe gaty kyn we gaty köp iş ýaly bolup görünýär.
This is the first time he has thought of this.	Ol muny ilkinji gezek pikir etdi.
Bad thing, the worst	Erbet mesele, iň erbet
He will do it.	Ol muny eder.
He wanted to see her again.	Ony ýene görmek isledi.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
I didn't think so before.	Biraz öň beýle pikir etmedim.
I can do anything for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin hemme zady edip bilerin.
That sounds like good news.	Bu gowy habar ýaly bolup görünýär.
I had a good evening	Agşam hezil etdim
When	Haçan.
Always there.	Elmydama şol ýerde.
He never said it would be clear.	Munuň aýdyň boljakdygyny hiç wagt aýtmady.
I want to be home with him	Men onuň bilen öýde bolmak isleýärin
I thought he did a really good job.	Ol hakykatdanam gaty gowy iş etdi öýdüpdim.
The first two years have been difficult.	Ilkinji iki ýyl kyn boldy.
He is not.	Ol beýle däl.
That's what happened to me.	Bu meniň bilen şeýle boldy.
I can't figure out who it could be	Kim bolup biljekdigini pikir edip bilemok
He can help you.	Ol size kömek edip biler.
So it always is.	Şonuň üçin hemişe bolýar.
I tried to call.	Jaň etjek boldum.
This is also not true.	Bu hem dogry däl.
Now he looks right.	Indi ol dogry görünýär.
I was fine with them	Men olar bilen gowy boldum
I didn't want to talk about it	Bu hakda gürleşmek islemedim
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
I thought about it.	Bu hakda pikir etdim.
I can't care less	Alada edip bilemok
Maybe call.	Belki jaň etmek mümkin.
Great time.	Ajaýyp wagt.
You have to report it.	Muny habar bermeli.
Do it every year.	Her ýyl et.
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
So beautiful	Şeýle bir owadan.
A lot of things are great.	Köp zat gaty gowy.
I couldn't do that	Men bu zady edip bilmedim
I only did this once.	Men muny diňe bir gezek etdim.
Absolutely right.	Elbetde dogry.
I'm not going to do anything about it.	Men bu hakda hiç zat etjek däl.
I never did that	Men muny hiç haçan etmedim
There will be no good things there, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Ol ýerde hiç hili gowy zat bolmaz "-diýdi.
About this book.	Bu kitap hakda.
It wasn't even what he did.	Bu hatda onuň eden işi däldi.
There is a reason for that.	Şonuň üçin munuň sebäbi bar.
I was a little worried about that	Men bu barada birneme alada etdim
I really tried	Men hakykatdanam synap gördüm
Not only that.	Diňe beýle däldi.
I trust you completely	Men saňa doly ynanýaryn
I'll take care of it right away.	Men derrew bu barada alada ederin.
I want to know more	Has köp zady bilmek isleýärin
You can help me.	Maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz.
This is not the case today.	Häzirki wagtda beýle däl.
Ses.	Ses.
I had nothing but you	Mende senden başga hiç zat ýokdy
Right now you	Edil şu wagt sen.
I just couldn't speak	Diňe gürläp bilmedim
It can be very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly bolup biler.
I had an idea last night	Düýn agşam bir pikir etdim
I can’t always be an adult for both of us	Elmydama ikimiz üçin uly adam bolup bilemok
There was a lot of police this time.	Polisiýa bu gezek gaty köp boldy.
Which is correct.	Haýsy dogry.
Someone can help me.	Kimdir biri maňa kömek edip biler.
It doesn't have to be one.	Bir bolmaly däl.
He is now.	Ol häzir.
I knew him better now.	Men ony indi has gowy bilýärdim.
I didn't even see it	Men hatda ony görmedim
It's been a long time coming.	Uzak wagt bäri gitdi.
It was not a bad idea.	Erbet pikir däldi.
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
I will be myself	Men özüm bolaryn
He could have done very well.	Ol gaty gowy edip bilýärdi.
There are two ways to do this.	Bu hakda iki ýol ýok.
I could not stay here long	Men bu ýerde uzak bolup bilmedim
I do it as a guy like you	Men muny özüňiz ýaly ýigit edýärin
In fact, this is not true.	Aslynda bu dogry däl.
That's a good thing	Gowy bir zat
This is a good thing for you.	Bu siziň üçin gowy zat.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
You have to do it now.	Indi etmeli.
Not so today.	Beýle däl, şu gün.
Not with you	Seniň bilen däl.
I hope something interesting happens tomorrow	Ertir gyzykly bir zat bolar diýip umyt edýärin
There is a young man there.	Ol ýerde bir ýigit bar.
He wants to see you and is here.	Ol sizi görmek isleýär we şu ýerde.
I didn't think it would be a problem	Mesele bolar öýdemokdym
It looks good now.	Häzir gowy görünýär.
It's not for me to say that.	Muny aýtmak meniň üçin däl.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
I only care about you	Men diňe sen hakda alada edýärin
I still don't know	Men henizem bilemok
Couldn't answer.	Jogap bolup bilmedi.
Maybe not at all.	Belki, asla bolmaz.
Of course, I didn't think about it	Elbetde, bu barada hiç zat pikir etmedim
I have heard this many times	Men muny köp gezek eşitdim
I didn’t think that could happen	Munuň bolup biljekdigini pikir etmedim
I couldn't see what he was doing	Men onuň näme edýändigini görüp bilmedim
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
I do that.	Men muny edýärin.
I couldn't get it	Men alyp bilmedim
He is coming.	Ol gelýär.
I got it, but he asked me for it	Men muny aldym, ýöne ol meni senden isledi
Now it really is.	Indi hakykatdanam şeýle.
She is absolutely gorgeous and beautiful.	Ol düýbünden ajaýyp we ajaýyp.
Maybe another time.	Belki başga bir wagt.
He came here.	Ol şu ýere geldi.
He would be what we need.	Ol bize gerek zat bolardy.
You have to go two.	Iki gitmeli.
I didn't know much about him	Men ol hakda köp zat bilmeýärdim
He came home.	Bu öýe geldi.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
She had to help herself.	Özüne kömek etmeli boldy.
This is new.	Bu täze.
He hoped it would be quick.	Çalt eder diýip umyt etdi.
I did not object	Men muňa garşy däldim
No one reported such a thing.	Hiç kim munuň ýaly zady habar bermedi.
It's always interesting to see that.	Muny görmek hemişe gyzykly.
I found it clever.	Men muny akylly gördüm.
It can't be.	Bolmagy mümkin däl.
This is hope.	Bu umyt.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I have to get it	Men ony almaly
There is no one here who can help you.	Bu ýerde hiç kimiň size kömek edip biljek zady ýok.
I had to stop it	Men muny bes etmeli boldum
I have no idea	Mende düýbünden pikir ýok
I haven't seen anything like this here	Munuň ýaly zady şu ýerde görmedim
It had to hurt.	Zyýan bermeli boldy.
What will happen 	Näme bolar?
I can't be	Men bolup bilemok
I have to go for an hour.	Bir sagat gitmeli.
So there are other things.	Şonuň üçin başga zatlar hem bar.
That's all there is to it.	Bu diňe şu.
This is a very bad decision.	Bu gaty erbet karar.
I told her everything about you	Men oňa sen hakda hemme zady aýtdym
Things like this do everything well.	Munuň ýaly zatlar hemme zady gowy edýär.
More or less bad.	Köp ýa-da hiç biri erbet däl.
I don't know why he thinks that	Näme üçin beýle pikir edýändigini bilemok
I didn't want to see him again.	Ony ýene görmek islemedim.
He knows everything.	Ol hemme zady bilýär.
He needs you.	Ol size mätäç.
A lot of things.	Köp zat.
What was the weekend like?	Dynç güni nähili boldy.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
I couldn't think of anything.	Men hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilmedim.
No worries, it's a difficult issue.	Alada ýok, kyn mesele.
He was everywhere.	Ol hemme ýerde bardy.
I don't believe he will do it	Men onuň muny etjekdigine ynanamok
This is happening everywhere.	Bu hemme ýerde bolýar.
She is really beautiful to me.	Ol meniň üçin hakykatdanam owadan.
Everyone knows the truth.	Hakykaty hemmeler bilýär.
This has to tell us something.	Bu bize bir zat aýtmaly.
This can never happen.	Bu hiç haçan bolup bilmez.
He allowed it.	Oňa rugsat berdi.
This is what you think.	Siziň pikiriňizçe bu şu.
I thought about it more this morning	Bu gün irden bu hakda has köp pikir etdim
Then came an idea.	Soň bolsa oňa bir pikir geldi.
I told you.	Men saňa aýtdym.
I'm very interested.	Men gaty gyzykly.
There is no interesting way.	Gyzykly ýol ýok.
There must be another person there.	Ol ýerde başga bir adam hem bar bolsa gerek.
It should never have been a big song.	Hiç haçan uly aýdym bolmaly däldi.
I never saw him	Men ony hiç haçan görmedim
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
I need help here.	Bu ýerde maňa kömek gerek.
It can and does happen often.	Hakykatdanam bolup biler we köplenç bolýar.
He came immediately.	Derrew geldi.
He has always been very good to me.	Ol meniň üçin hemişe gaty gowy boldy.
A lot of people don’t like it.	Köp adam muny halamaýar.
There is also.	Şeýle hem bar.
At home on the weekend	Dynç güni öýde.
A year ago.	Bir ýyl mundan ozal.
I was crazy again	Men ýene däli boldum
I saw it another day.	Başga bir gün gördüm.
It takes several hours.	Birnäçe sagat gerek.
I didn’t want to let that happen	Men muňa mümkinçilik bermek islemedim
It's faster now.	Indi has çalt.
One day	Bir gün.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu hakda pikir etmeli bolmaly.
The night was good.	Gije gowy boldy.
I know this very well	Men muny gaty gowy bilýärin
Because it has to be very fast.	Sebäbi gaty çalt bolmaly.
He did not report to police.	Ol polisiýa habar bermedi.
There is no question.	Ol ýerde sorag ýok.
I'll think about you	Men sen hakda pikir ederin
I think that's what he wants.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu onuň isleýän zady.
Two years ago.	Iki ýyl öň.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
I think this is very difficult.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty kyn.
It really happened.	Bu hakykatdanam boldy.
I care about you	Men siziň üçin alada edýärin
He didn't tell me.	Ol maňa aýtmady.
Isn't it interesting?	Gyzykly dälmi?
Now no one has done that.	Indi hiç kim muny etmedi.
Of course, this was not always the case.	Elbetde, bu hemişe beýle däldi.
Of course I still do	Elbetde, henizem edýärin
Absolutely right.	Elbetde, dogry.
That's what he did.	Bu onuň eden zady.
He went there today to get it.	Ol almak üçin şu gün ol ýere gitdi.
This is not what happened today.	Şu gün bolup geçen zatlar beýle bolmaly däldi.
You know, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Bilýärsiň, ony has gowy.
Someone else has to do that.	Başga biri muny etmeli.
Not surprisingly.	Gaty geň zat ýok.
Fast and easy.	Çalt we aňsat.
This was last week.	Bu geçen hepde boldy.
I don't like it anywhere	Men hiç ýerde halamok
I can only go home	Men diňe öýe gidip bilerin
He could do nothing.	Ol hiç zat edip bilmedi.
One voice is only one voice	Bir ses diňe bir ses
I can't think of the right word	Dogry söz hakda pikir edip bilemok
It would be nice	Gowy bolardy
What could be the problem?	Mesele näme bolup biler?
It takes a job.	Munuň üçin bir iş gerek.
I couldn't even see anything	Men hatda hiç zady görüp bilmedim
There is no complete answer.	Muňa doly jogap ýok.
Not just himself.	Diňe özi däl.
Sorry, not enough time.	Bagyşlaň, wagt ýeterlik däl.
Someone else helps me here once.	Başga biri maňa bu ýerde bir gezek kömek edýär.
He thought a lot.	Ol köp pikir etdi.
I have tried myself many times	Özümi köp gezek synap gördüm
Coming home very quickly.	Öýe gaty çalt gelýär.
I didn't know if he wanted to talk to me	Onuň meniň bilen gürleşmek isleýändigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilmedim
I just help.	Men diňe kömek edýärin.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
He would be happy.	Bagtly bolardy.
Which will be.	Haýsy bolar.
I have been there twice	Men ol ýerde iki gezek boldum
I didn't have that problem.	Mende bu mesele ýokdy.
It's easy to do it all.	Hemmesini etmek aňsat.
I only care about you.	Men diňe sen hakda alada edýärin.
I think it's good.	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
No permission required.	Rugsat gerek däl.
This time there was nothing.	Bu gezek hiç zat ýokdy.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
I never thought of seeing you again	Men seni ýene görmek hakda pikir etmedim
He's gone now.	Ol şu wagt gitdi.
This is the police.	Bu polisiýa.
I'm thinking about next year.	Indiki ýyl hakda pikir edýärin.
It shouldn't be too hard.	Gaty kyn bolmaly däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe gowy iş.
I know a little bit about first aid	Ilkinji kömek hakda birneme bilýärin
Okay, maybe something else.	Bolýar, belki ýene bir zat.
Of course not yet.	Elbetde, entek ýok.
He ignored it.	Ol muňa üns bermedi.
I knew then	Men şol wagt bilýärdim
They must be crazy.	Olar däli bolmaly.
I am completely with you	Men doly siziň bilen
This is often true.	Bu, köplenç dogry.
There are two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar.
I did it myself	Men muny özüm ýeterlik etdim
I don't know why.	Näme üçin bilemok.
It can't be like that.	Munuň ýaly bolup bilmez.
It's too loud.	Bu gaty ses.
He was new here.	Ol bu ýerde täze boldy.
There may be an opportunity there.	Ol ýerde bir mümkinçilik bolup biler.
Not difficult.	Kyn däl.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Munuň gaty köp zady bar.
It should be easy to see.	Ony görmek aňsat bolmaly.
I called because it sounds crazy	Men jaň etdim, sebäbi bu däli ýaly
I don't know if this happened or not.	Munuň bolandygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny bilemok.
He started working.	Ol işe başlady.
I have done this several times before	Men muny öňem birnäçe gezek etdim
Just an idea.	Diňe bir pikir.
I knew nothing about it	Men bu barada hiç zat bilmeýärdim
No help was required for this	Munuň üçin hiç hili kömek gerek däldi
I can't tell anyone but you	Men senden başga hiç kime aýdyp bilemok
I'm still worried about that.	Men henizem bu barada alada edýärin.
I couldn't take it anymore	Indi muny alyp bilmedim
No need to buy.	Satyn almak hökman däl.
I can try again	Men ýene synap görüp bilerin
Very good day	Gaty gowy gün.
There was nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.
I didn't think of anything else	Bu hakda başga zat pikir etmedim
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
No need for a reason.	Sebäp gerek däl.
Now he is alone.	Indi ol ýeke boldy.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Munuň iň ähtimal sebäbi.
This month a few years ago.	Birnäçe ýyl ozal şu ​​aý.
Actually a lot like you	Aslynda seniň ýaly köp zat
In a good voice	Gowy ses bilen.
I know, weird.	Bilýän, geň.
I'm almost nowhere	Men hiç ýerde diýen ýaly däl
I have no idea	Mende asla pikir ýok
I didn't want to see him again	Men ony ýene görmek islemedim
You will have to help me here.	Bu ýerde maňa kömek etmeli bolarsyňyz.
I don't think I should say anything else	Başga hiç zat aýtmaly däl öýdýän
I could see it.	Men muny görüp bilýärdim.
I can't see you today	Men bu gün sen hakda görüp bilemok
I never wanted anything else.	Men hiç wagt başga zat islemedim.
If there is a next time.	Indiki gezek bar bolsa.
In fact, there is no problem.	Aslynda hiç hili mesele ýok.
Time is short.	Wagt gysga.
What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Adam bolmak nähili gowy zat.
I don’t know if he knows that or not.	Muny bilýändigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilemok.
I was not.	Men beýle däldim.
Good guy	Gowy ýigit.
He is now a man.	Ol indi adam.
I told her everything.	Men oňa hemme zady aýtdym.
He did not want to speak to police.	Ol häzir polisiýa bilen gürleşmek islemedi.
I don't believe that	Men muňa ynanamok
I can't do that anymore	Men muny indi edip bilemok
It turned out.	Bu çykdy.
He could not speak.	Ol gürläp bilmedi.
I have never had enough of that	Men muňa hiç wagt ýeterlik bolup bilmedim
He did the same.	Ol hem şeýle etdi.
It's not time at all, it's nothing.	Bu asla wagt däl, bu hiç zat däl.
What causes this?	Muňa näme sebäp bolýar?
I think it would be great	Ajaýyp bolar diýip pikir edýärin
Of course it will be good.	Elbetde gowy bolar.
Here	Bu ýerde.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I'm still the same	Men henizem şol bir
I haven’t thought that way in years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri beýle pikir etmedim.
I can't take it anymore	Indi alyp bilemok
I had to help you.	Men size kömek etmeli boldum.
I think you need someone who wants you	Seni isleýän biri gerek diýip pikir edýärin
Only two or three are really good.	Diňe iki ýa-da üç hakykatdanam gowy.
This was not possible.	Bu beýle mümkin däldi.
I never had to go with him	Men onuň bilen hiç wagt gitmeli däldim
It didn't work.	Bu etmedi.
Then he returned home.	Soň bolsa öýüne gaýdyp geldi.
I can tell you this here	Muny size şu ýerde aýdyp bilerin
Nothing now.	Häzir hiç zat ýok.
I have no help, nothing	Mende kömek ýok, hiç zat ýok
I want more	Mundan has köp zat isleýärin
So it wasn’t close.	Şonuň üçin ýakyn däldi.
There was no word yet.	Entek söz ýokdy.
I want to talk about you.	Men sen hakda gürleşmek isleýärin.
Now both words are everywhere.	Indi iki söz hem hemme ýerde.
That's the way it is now.	Indi şeýle boldy.
This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe şeýle.
This is great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy.
There is no way to know this.	Muny bilmek üçin ýol ýok.
This is not very true.	Bu gaty dogry däl.
So it will be very difficult.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty kyn bolar.
I haven't thought of that yet	Men entek beýle pikir etmedim
I really need help.	Maňa hakykatdanam kömek gerek.
What to do with it.	Munuň bilen näme etmeli.
This seems to be the right answer.	Bu dogry jogap ýaly bolup görünýär.
I couldn't help it, it just came out	Men oňa kömek edip bilmedim, diňe çykdy
I gave it to him	Men ony oňa berdim
They were there last night.	Düýn gije olar bardy.
I saw it somewhere else.	Başga bir ýerde bolandygyny gördüm.
Not for anyone else, just for myself.	Başga hiç kim üçin däl, diňe özüm üçin.
Now that's bad.	Indi bu erbet.
I'm not full	Men doly däl
I couldn't get here fast enough	Men bu ýere ýeterlik çalt baryp bilmedim
I am the last person to be with him right now.	Men şu wagt onuň bilen bile bolmaly iň soňky adam.
You know that.	Muny bilýärsiň.
I have always loved this job	Bu işi elmydama gowy gördüm
I want to say what happened.	Näme bolandygyny aýtmak isleýärin.
That could be the case.	Bu şeýle bolup biler.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He did a really good job	Ol hakykatdanam gaty gowy iş etdi
I can see that now.	Men muny indi görüp bilýärin.
We are absolutely fine.	Biz düýbünden gowy.
I didn't think about it	Men bu barada hiç zat pikir etmedim
Every night	Her gije.
What now	Indi näme?
In fact, he didn't.	Aslynda beýle etmedi.
I thought about that night	Şol gije hakda pikir etdim
I can't care less about him	Men onuň hakda alada edip bilemok
There is no way.	Hiç hili ýol ýok.
I've been here for an hour	Men bir sagat boldum
That seems to me to be the message.	Bu maňa habar ýaly bolup görünýär.
I only know that this is not true.	Munuň dogry däldigini diňe bilýärin.
I helped him because he asked me to.	Men oňa kömek etdim, sebäbi ol menden haýyş etdi.
I couldn't promise it.	Men muňa söz berip bilmedim.
I don't have to give him anything	Men oňa hiç zat bermeli däl
I didn't do that for you	Men muny seniň üçin etmedim
This is not true, it is not true.	Bu dogry däl, bu dogry däl.
He is an interesting guy.	Ol gyzykly ýigit.
I don’t really know why he does that	Aslynda näme üçin beýle edýändigini bilemok
She looked very young.	Ol gaty ýaş ýalydy.
Helps.	Kömek edýär.
I always think of you	Men sen hakda hemişe pikir edýärin
He thought he had to tell the truth	Ol hakykaty aýtmaly, diýip pikir etdi
Okay, maybe better.	Bolýar, belki has gowy.
She is so young.	Ol şeýle ýaş.
It was not easy to be with	Bilen bolmak aňsat däldi
I won't need it tonight	Bu gije maňa gerek bolmaz
We can't do that anymore.	Indi edip bilmeris.
I could not go	Men gidip bilmedim
I definitely got it	Men muny hökman aldym
It's me.	Bu men.
I need police.	Maňa polisiýa gerek.
This is better.	Bu has gowy.
Not every girl is like that.	Her bir gyz beýle däl.
It will be better for him.	Bu onuň üçin has gowy bolar.
I can't see anymore	Men indi görüp bilemok
Older than me	Menden uly
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
He agreed.	Ol muňa razy boldy.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Of course not.	Elbetde bolmaz.
Of course, that's the way it is.	Elbetde, edil şeýle bolýar.
I do not mind	Men asla garşy däl
It could be worse.	Elbetde has erbet bolup biler.
It's big enough.	Ol ýeterlik uly.
Close to home	Öýe ýakyn.
I had a really bad, crazy night.	Hakykatdanam erbet, däli gije boldum.
I have to give her a break	Men oňa dynç bermeli
OK! 	Bolýar!
He didn't have to go far.	Uzak gitmeli däldi.
I care a lot for you and always have	Men siziň üçin gaty köp alada edýärin we elmydama bar
This is often something else.	Bu, köplenç başga zat.
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly mümkinçilik ýok.
He worries about that.	Ol muňa alada edýär.
That's what I do.	Bu men edýärin.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
This will stop it.	Bu ony bes eder.
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men munuň mümkin däldigini aýtdym
I don't want to talk to you	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek islämok
I have this song.	Mende bu aýdym bar.
This is not the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek däl.
A few, but not many	Birnäçe, ýöne kän däl
I haven't seen him in months	Men ony birnäçe aý bäri görmedim
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Beautiful and beautiful.	Owadan we ajaýyp.
I did what everyone would do	Her kimiň etjek zadyny etdim
I have very good news	Mende gaty gowy habar bar
I didn't do that.	Men beýle etmedim.
I still didn't know anything about it.	Men henizem ol hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
I was not for him	Men onuň üçin däldi
I want to do that with him	Men onuň bilen muny etmek isleýärin
Of course, it was really good.	Elbetde, hakykatdanam gaty gowy boldy.
No idea.	Hiç hili pikir ýok.
He only has things.	Onuň diňe zatlary bar.
He is a good man.	Ol gowy adam.
Everything is interesting, and so it is.	Hemme zat gyzykly, bu hem şeýle.
He didn't either.	Ol hem etmedi.
There are actually two things.	Aslynda iki zat.
I already got something very interesting	Men eýýäm gaty gyzykly bir zady aldym
I have a lot to do today.	Bu gün etmeli köp zadym bar.
You can be.	Siz bolup bilersiňiz.
Okay, not yet.	Bolýar, entek däl.
Good news.	Gowy habar.
I believe it can be.	Bolup biljekdigine ynanýaryn.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I have something and it happened	Mende bir zat bar we ol şeýle boldy
I did not know right.	Dogry bilmedim.
A man who will never be	Aslynda asla bolmaz adam
I'm a little worried about that.	Men bu barada birneme alada edýärin.
I hope he can be there	Ol şol ýerde bolup biler diýip umyt edýärin
I can't do that for you	Men muny seniň üçin edip bilemok
This has always been the case for me.	Bu meniň üçin hemişe şeýle boldy.
I don't know anything about him.	Men ol hakda hiç zat bilemok.
They are not.	Olar ýok.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu dogry däl ýaly.
OK, you can.	Bolýar, edip bolýar.
I think he wants to do the right thing	Meniň pikirimçe, ol dogry zady etmek isleýär
It wasn't that good anymore.	Indi beýle gowy däldi.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilenok.
I was with him that day.	Şol gün men onuň bilen boldum.
A lot of noise.	Köp ses.
It was the same for him.	Bu hem onuň üçin edil şonuň ýalydy.
I gave you a long time ago	Men size köp wagt mundan ozal berdim
I didn't have a good answer	Mende gowy jogap ýokdy
Maybe an hour.	Belki bir sagat.
It shouldn't have been.	Bolmaly däldi.
I don't think that's possible	Bu mümkin däl diýip pikir edýärin
I know more.	Men has köp zady bilýärin.
This is a good thing	Bu gowy zat
It should be.	Bolmaly.
I knew it would happen	Boljakdygyny bilýärdim
I never do anything myself	Hiç haçan özüm hiç zat etmeýärin
We can see a lot.	Biz köp zady görüp bileris.
He can do just that	Ol muny edil şu ýerde edip biler
Okay.	Bolýar.
I have to promise	Men söz bermeli
I never thought this could happen	Munuň bolup biljekdigini hiç wagt pikir etmedim
He really did exist.	Ol hakykatdanam bardy.
I could not see him anymore	Men ony indi görüp bilmedim
I had hope.	Mende umyt bardy.
I heard you yesterday.	Düýn seni eşitdim.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
I think that should be good	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy bolmaly
I never thought it would happen	Munuň boljakdygyny asla pikir etmedim
One night	Bir gije.
What a happy, good, intelligent man.	Nähili bagtly, gowy, akylly adam.
It did me good.	Bu maňa gowy etdi.
He did nothing else.	Ol başga hiç zat etmedi.
I think that's a good idea	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy pikir
No one likes it.	Hiç kim ony halamaýar.
This is not an interesting task.	Bu gyzykly bir iş däl.
I'm not with anyone.	Men hiç kim bilen däl.
He made many decisions.	Ol köp karar berdi.
This is not very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly däl.
I think that's a good answer.	Bu gowy jogap diýip pikir edýärin.
Oh, everything.	Aý, hemme zat.
In fact, you have no choice.	Hakykatdanam, size başga ýol ýok.
It's still hard to see.	Ony görmek henizem kyn.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu meniň üçin gerek.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I never saw it.	Men muny hiç wagt görmedim.
That's enough for me.	Bu meniň üçin ýeterlik.
I had to go with him.	Men onuň bilen gitmeli boldum.
Of course, that is not all.	Elbetde, diňe bir zat däl.
I haven't seen anyone, only you	Hiç kimi görmedim, diňe sen
I really need one last time	Maňa hakykatdanam soňky gezek gerek
Because he couldn't.	Sebäbi edip bilmedi.
I have you.	Sen mende bar.
There is a long way to go	Uzak ýol bar
I'm sure it will	Boljakdygyna ynanýaryn
I don't like this	Men bu işi halamok
Because it's not you.	Sebäbi bu sen däl.
Maybe not a good thing.	Belki gowy zat däl.
I am so happy for her and you	Men onuň we siziň üçin gaty begenýärin
I didn't need that.	Maňa beýle gerek däldi.
I did not know	Bilmedim
He is often here.	Ol köplenç şu ýerde.
It does well.	Gowy edýär.
I need a break	Maňa biraz dynç gerek
This is not difficult.	Bu kyn däl.
I don't care about money.	Men pul hakda alada etmeýärin.
He didn't have much time.	Kän wagty ýokdy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu ýerde şeýle.
We can't say.	Biz aýdyp bilmeris.
He is no more.	Ol indi ýok.
I didn’t want to talk to him anymore	Men ony mundan beýläk gürleşmek islemedim
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I could tell him something	Men oňa bir zat aýdyp bilýärdim
I know very well	Men gaty gowy bilýärin
He is very close.	Ol gaty ýakyn.
Happy to help	Kömek etmekden has bagtly
I'll take care of that.	Men muňa alada ederin.
And then he didn't call her.	Soň bolsa oňa jaň etmedi.
I am happy for you.	Men seniň üçin begenýärin.
He thought I could do it	Men muny edip bilerin diýip pikir etdi
It still exists.	Ol henizem bar.
I couldn't say that	Men muny aýdyp bilmedim
I shouldn't have let you	Men saňa ýol bermeli däldim
This is exactly what happened.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
I asked her to leave.	Men onuň bilen gitmegi haýyş etdim.
It didn't work out very well.	Kän gowy iş etmedi.
I did nothing.	Men hiç zat etmedim.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
It's very beautiful here.	Bu ýerde gaty owadan.
That was not enough.	Ol muňa ýeterlik däldi.
I want to tell her this	Men oňa muny aýtmak isleýärin
Something could happen to you	Siziň üçin bir zat bolup biler
It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
He has already returned.	Ol eýýäm gaýdyp geldi.
All I have to say is that this will not be surprising	Diňe bir zat aýtmaly, bu geň bolmaz
I'm still scared	Men henizem gorkýaryn
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Good job, everyone.	Gowy iş, hemmeler.
I was not at all surprised	Men asla geň görmedim
I didn’t see it as a big deal	Men muny uly bir zat diýip görmedim
There is good news.	Gowy habar bar.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
He did great things.	Ajaýyp zatlar etdi.
He was not far away.	Ol beýle uzak däldi.
Nothing else.	Başga bir zat däl.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Muny habar bermek dogry bolsa gerek.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
The idea comes later.	Pikir soň gelýär.
This is something new.	Bu täze zat.
The same thing.	Şol bir zat.
I'm not there yet.	Men henizem ýok.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
Just like you	Edil seniň ýaly.
I called him.	Men oňa jaň etdim.
I really didn't see it	Men hakykatdanam görmedim
This is a really good thing.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy zat.
This is for me.	Bu meniň üçin.
I just thought about it	Men bu hakda diňe pikir etdim
I can't live like that there	Men ol ýerde beýle durmuş alyp bilemok
Now I can give it to you	Indi saňa berip bilerin
He just couldn't help himself.	Ol diňe özüne kömek edip bilmedi.
I knew it was together	Bilelikde bolandygyny bilýärdim
It's too early.	Bu entek has ir.
I thought someone should go with me	Kimdir biri meniň bilen gitmeli diýip pikir etdim
In a loud voice.	Gaty ses bilen.
Long time no see	Kän wagt.
This is a request.	Bu haýyş.
I already have a job	Mende eýýäm bir iş bar
This is an easy lie.	Bu aňsat ýalan.
Not human.	Adam däl.
I can't see this case	Men bu işi görüp bilemok
Not about the good stuff.	Gowy zat hakda däl.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I did it yesterday and the day before	Düýn we bir gün öň etdim
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I can't think of it	Men bu hakda pikir edip bilemok
I really didn't know	Men hakykatdanam bilmedim
That time has come.	Şol wagt indi geldi.
I did not want to give it to me	Meni bermek islemedim
I called him, but he didn't answer	Men oňa jaň etdim, ýöne ol jogap bermedi
This is not the case now.	Bu mesele häzir däl.
He said it was nothing new.	Ol munuň täze zat däldigini aýtdy.
They are human.	Olar adam.
We can only do so much.	Biz diňe köp zady edip bileris.
We are there.	Biz şol ýerde.
What do I know now?	Men indi näme bilen bilýärin.
I even thought about doing it again	Hatda ýene bir gezek etmek hakda pikir etdim
And it will never happen.	We asla bolmaz.
I know this is not all	Munuň hemme zat däldigini bilýärin
I can't do everything for you	Men seniň üçin hemme zady edip bilemok
Because they don’t exist.	Sebäbi olar ýok.
Now he had no one, nothing.	Indi onuň hiç kim, hiç zady ýokdy.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
Not like me.	Men ýaly däl.
It's been a while.	Birneme wagt bäri çykdy.
It will be the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly bolar.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
This.	Iki.
I didn't need anyone to talk to	Maňa gürleşmek üçin biri gerek däldi
I could not speak	Men gürläp bilmedim
No answer yet.	Häzir jogap ýok.
I think he even started to relax	Meniň pikirimçe, hatda dynç alyp başlady
I was not ready for them	Men olar üçin taýyn däldim
You can do that.	Muny edip bilersiňiz.
There is no final answer.	Soňky jogap ýok.
Of course he did.	Elbetde, etdi.
He gave it to me.	Ol maňa berdi.
I don't want to be here	Men bu ýerde bolmak islämok
Is that really the case?	Hakykatdanam şeýlemi?
Everyone is doing young things here.	Her kim bu ýerde ýaş zatlar edýär.
I just want to be that way.	Men diňe şeýle bolmak isleýärin.
You are really beautiful.	Siz hakykatdanam owadan.
It was for today.	Bu gün üçin boldy.
Here's another one.	Ine, başga biri.
Maybe today.	Belki, şu gün.
That's more.	Bu has köp.
He never did and never will.	Hiç haçan etmedi we bolmaz.
That may have been the last thing he did.	Bu onuň iň soňky eden işi bolup biler.
I can't think of anything to do	Etjek zadym hakda pikir edip bilemok
That's the way it is now.	Häzir şeýle.
I can take care of myself	Men özüm hakda alada edip bilerin
There is nothing wrong with you.	Ol ýerde size hiç zat ýok.
Not many people.	Adam kän däl.
And now that day has come.	Indi bolsa şol gün geldi.
He was not there to take me away.	Ol meni alyp gitmek üçin däldi.
I tried it last night	Düýn agşam synap gördüm
Just like last year.	Geçen ýyl ýaly.
He wanted one.	Birini isledi.
Now tell me.	Indi aýdyň.
I have nothing yet.	Mende entek hiç zat ýok.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
I question that.	Men muny sorag edýärin.
He can take you	Seni alyp biler
This is certainly possible.	Bu, elbetde mümkin.
I saw him this morning	Men ony şu gün irden gördüm
I'll take care of it tonight.	Men şu agşam alada ederin.
This is really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet.
He needs me now.	Ol maňa häzir mätäç.
He doesn't do that.	Ol muny etmeýär.
I don't think so	Men bu hakda pikir etmeýärin
Someone has to say.	Kimdir biri aýtmaly.
I never did that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmedim.
It doesn't help anyone.	Bu hiç kime kömek etmeýär.
I knew he was crazy about me	Onuň maňa däli bolandygyny bilýärdim
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
I had a great time myself	Özümi gaty gowy dynç aldym
I didn’t really want to know.	Aslynda bilmek islemedim.
I knew what it was like	Munuň näme bolup biljekdigini bilýärdim
I have to ask a big question	Men uly sorag bermeli
I should never have told him that	Men oňa muny hiç haçan aýtmaly däldim
Of course.	Elbetde.
It was a good decision.	Gowy karar boldy.
Tonight	Bu gije.
I never thought it would happen.	Munuň boljakdygyny asla pikir etmedim.
Adam was certainly right.	Adam elbetde dogry aýtdy.
I just want the truth	Men diňe hakykaty isleýärin
.	.
In fact, it's not even close.	Aslynda, hatda ýakyn hem däl.
He asked not.	Ol beýle däl diýip sorady.
I never wanted to	Men hiç haçan islemedim
I can't tell you what to do	Näme etmelidigimi aýdyp bilemok
I didn't have to worry	Alada etmeli däldim
For two weeks.	Iki hepde bäri.
These two are interesting.	Bu ikisi gyzykly.
No one knew.	Hiç kim hiç zat bilmeýärdi.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Not really.	Hakykatdanam hökman däl.
Oh, it looks so beautiful.	Aý, gaty owadan görünýär.
It would be difficult, but it would be possible.	Kyn bolardy, ýöne mümkin bolardy.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly däl.
This is really strange	Bu hakykatdanam geň
It was still difficult.	Bu henizem kyn boldy.
He said there could be a problem.	Mesele bolup biler diýdi.
Of course it is possible.	Elbetde mümkin.
In fact, he did not.	Hakykatdanam, beýle etmedi.
I almost don't believe it	Men muňa ynanamok diýen ýaly
Okay, back to having a little fun.	Bolýar, biraz hezil gaýdyp gelýär.
I didn't know anything.	Men hiç zady bilmeýärdim.
I didn't know that	Men muny bilmeýärdim
I didn't want to see me	Meni görmek islemedim
Tell me.	Aýdyň.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
I have something after that	Mundan soň bir zadym bar
Something else would have to go there.	Başga bir zat ol ýere gitmeli bolardy.
Knowing that he can do anything.	Her zady edip biljekdigini bilmek.
This is often not necessary.	Bu köplenç zerur däl.
I told him a lot	Men oňa köp habar berdim
I'm not a big deal	Men uly kynçylyk däl
Of course, not all the time.	Elbetde, bütin wagt däl.
I didn't do anything good here	Men bu ýerde hiç hili gowy iş etmedim
More with the sun.	Gün bilen has köp.
This year is different.	Bu ýyl başga.
You are human.	Sen adam.
I couldn't do that to him	Men oňa muny edip bilmedim
This was nothing new for me.	Bu meniň üçin täze zat däldi.
No one else.	Başga hiç kim däl.
I always think about it	Men bu hakda hemişe pikir edýärin
This is often not the case.	Köplenç beýle däl.
Every face was new.	Her ýüz täze boldy.
I'm sorry, but so be it.	Bagyşlaň, ýöne şeýle.
I almost did nothing	Men hiç zat etmedim diýen ýaly
This is a problem.	Bu bir mesele.
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
You have to be here.	Siz şu ýerde bolmaly.
I'm not happy at all	Men asla bagtly däl
He was no one.	Ol hiç kim däldi.
It was as if he had done it.	Muny eden ýalydy.
And then what happened.	Soň bolsa näme boldy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
There was nothing else I could do.	Başga edip biljek başga zady ýokdy.
I had to take it twice	Iki gezek almaly boldum
He said he hoped it would come.	Geler diýip umyt edýändigini aýtdy.
This can take several years.	Bu birnäçe ýyl alyp biler.
Maybe this will help.	Belki bu kömek eder.
That year.	Şol ýyl.
I've always been there	Elmydama şol ýerde bolýan adam boldum
I thought about life	Durmuş hakda pikir etdim
A lot of people are like me.	Köp adam meniň ýaly.
I was really good	Men hakykatdanam gowy boldum
He did it there again.	Ol ýerde ýene etdi.
I don't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmeýärin.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Munuň ýaly zadyň wagty geldi.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
I didn’t want to think anymore	Indi pikir etmek islemedim
You will all be.	Siz hemmeler bolarsyňyz.
I allowed him to do whatever he wanted	Men oňa islän zadyny etmäge rugsat berdim
He thought it was strange.	Geň zat diýip pikir etdi.
We can't do that.	Muny edip bilmeris.
No one else can take this job.	Bu işi başga hiç kim alyp bilmez.
Of course, it was today for me.	Elbetde, meniň üçin bu gün boldy.
It was not interesting to me.	Bu meniň üçin gyzykly däldi.
This is really interesting	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly
I don't know what to try	Näme synap görüp biljekdigini bilemok
we.	we.
That was not the case for me.	Meniň üçin beýle däldi.
Is that so?	Bu şeýlemi?
I can't do anything about it	Men bu barada hiç zat edip bilemok
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
He gave no reason for his decision.	Kararyna hiç hili sebäp bermedi.
This is a beautiful word.	Bu owadan söz.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
Alone, I did nothing	Men ýeke özüm, hiç zat etmedim
I really want to try it.	Hakykatdanam synap görmek isleýärin.
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
For sound.	Ses üçin.
He would be there too.	Ol hem şol ýerde bolardy.
I never saw you	Men seni asla görüp bilmedim
I think it can't hurt	Zyýan berip bilmez öýdýän
In fact, he did not do that.	Aslynda ol beýle zat etmedi.
This is new to me.	Bu meniň üçin täze.
I was with this man	Men bu adam bilen boldum
I really didn't know anything about it	Men hakykatdanam bu hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
Must be with me.	Meniň bilen bolmaly.
I rested	Men dynç aldym
I'm right here	Men, edil şu ýerde
In fact, I didn't do anything	Aslynda hiç hili iş etmedim
I had to answer.	Men jogap bermeli boldum.
I can't call yet	Entek jaň edip bilemok
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
It was a serious matter.	Çynlakaý iş boldy.
I will be with you from now on	Mundan beýläk seniň bilen bolaryn
I won’t be much here	Men bu ýerde has köp bolmaz
I can't tell her.	Men oňa aýdyp bilemok.
I can't do it right now	Men şu wagt edip bilemok
It can't be.	Ol bolup bilmez.
I thought there was only one.	Diňe biri bar öýdüpdim.
This can be very good for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty gowy bolup biler.
For you too.	Seniň üçin hem.
I will do everything right.	Men hemme zady dogry etjek.
You have to help him.	Oňa kömek etmeli.
I advised him to do	Etmegi maslahat berdim
I can get good things	Gowy zatlar alyp bilerin
Bigger is better.	Uly bolsa has gowy.
He did not answer.	Oňa jogap bermedi.
Three meals.	Üç nahar.
I tried to destroy it	Men ony ýok etjek boldum
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
It was good for me.	Bu maňa gowy boldy.
It was life.	Durmuş boldy.
I asked you a question.	Size bir sorag berdim.
Maybe it won't be good.	Belki gowy bolmaz.
Only one sound all night.	Bütin gije diňe bir ses.
Every idea is a good idea.	Her pikir gowy pikir.
It looks bad.	Erbet görünýär.
I have to say something else.	Başga bir zady aýtmaly.
OK, maybe not.	Bolýar, belki ýok.
He gave her good advice.	Oňa gowy maslahat berdi.
I thought about it a lot	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim
And it's too big.	We gaty uly.
It was a very interesting day.	Bu gaty gyzykly gün boldy.
I could not do that once	Men muny bir gezek edip bilmedim
For this.	Munuň üçin.
He no longer needed it.	Oňa indi gerek däldi.
You don't have to worry about it right now.	Şu wagt oňa alada etmeli däl.
Help and more.	Kömek we başga bir zat.
There is no answer.	Jogap bolmaz.
In fact, this is not true.	Aslynda bu dogry däl.
Oh no, no.	Aý ýok, ýok.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
This is a great opportunity.	Bu ajaýyp mümkinçilik.
What happens	Näme bolýar.
Nothing can be done.	Hiç zat edip bolmaz.
Saying something, maybe.	Bir zatlar aýtmak, belki.
I know this is not easy for you either.	Munuň hem size aňsat däldigini bilýärin.
I still believe that.	Men muňa henizem ynanýaryn.
He is not like you.	Ol seniň ýaly däl.
The reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi.
There is nothing I can do about it.	Maňa edip biljek hiç zadyň ýok.
He is a difficult man.	Ol kyn adam.
I think it may take some time	Biraz wagt gerek bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin
Who was that.	Kim şeýle boldy.
I can't do anything here	Men bu ýerde hiç zat edip bilemok
Of course, I couldn't tell him that	Elbetde, men oňa muny aýdyp bilmedim
Anything can happen.	Hemme zat bolup biler.
I can't figure out why.	Näme üçin beýle däldigini pikir edip bilemok.
About life.	Durmuş hakda.
I thought it was a good thing	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir etdim
I can't go home again	Men ýene öýe gaýdyp bilemok
I don't do that anymore.	Indi muny etmeýärin.
That's bad.	Munuň özi erbet.
I didn’t actually see that	Aslynda muny görmedim
I couldn't think of it	Men bu hakda pikir edip bilmedim
He couldn't do anything else.	Başga bir zat edip bilmedi.
Life is not easy.	Durmuş aňsat däl.
He would be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolardy.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
I was so bad about that.	Men muňa gaty erbet boldum.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
Because you are here.	Sebäbi sen şu ýerde.
Now he has decided.	Indi ol karar berdi.
Weekend	Dynç güni
I've never seen you here before	Men sizi öň bu ýerde görmedim
I'm just a voice tonight	Men şu gije diňe ses
This is no longer the case.	Bu indi mesele däl.
I heard good things about you.	Men sen hakda gowy zat eşitdim.
He must be you.	Ol sen bolmaly.
And no one.	Şeýle hem hiç bir adam.
Many	Köp.
Only you and I this time.	Diňe sen we men bu gezek.
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
I didn't see that happen	Munuň bolandygyny görmedim
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
I have to destroy it, but not time	Men ony ýok etmeli, ýöne wagt däl
It's fun to be with her	Onuň bilen bolmak gyzykly
I haven't seen him in a few weeks	Birnäçe hepde bäri ony görmedim
He could not see anyone anywhere.	Ol hiç ýerde hiç kimi görüp bilmedi.
This could happen one day.	Bu bir gün bolup biler.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
He did the same.	Ol hem edil şonuň ýaly etdi.
I didn't want to go anywhere with him	Men onuň bilen hiç ýere gitmek islemedim
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I can talk about it now.	Men häzir bu barada gürläp bilerin.
Sounds great.	Gaty gowy ýaly.
I really want to help you	Men hakykatdanam size kömek etmek isleýärin
They are close to there.	Olar ol ýere ýakyn.
I hope there is still some time left	Henizem ýene birnäçe wagt galdy diýip umyt edýärin
We need to do better.	Biz has gowy etmeli.
She was worried.	Ol alada galdy.
They are nothing.	Olar hiç zat däl.
It will take more people.	Munuň üçin has köp adam gerek bolar.
I've been alone before	Mundan has öň ýeke boldum
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
I took some time yesterday	Düýn biraz wagt aldym
They were not.	Olar beýle däldi.
We.	We.
I did nothing	Men hiç zat etmedim
It's really close.	Aslynda gaty ýakyn.
I'm still	Men henizem.
I can't think of it.	Men bu hakda pikir edip bilemok.
He may have to leave. "	Gitmeli bolmagy mümkin "-diýdi.
It will be interesting to see.	Muny görmek gyzykly bolar.
There is a problem.	Dogry bir mesele bar.
I hope it will be good tomorrow	Ertir gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I didn't know it existed	Munuň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
I didn't think much of it	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmedim
Bad, bad things.	Erbet, erbet zatlar.
That should be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolmaly.
I can't get it.	Men muny alyp bilemok.
I didn't have to tell you yet	Men entek size habar bermeli däldim
I can do it elsewhere	Başga bir ýerde edip bilerin
He never had a chance.	Oňa hiç wagt mümkinçilik ýokdy.
He did it very well.	Ol muny gaty gowy etdi.
He came out again.	Ol ýene çykdy.
There is no such thing at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda beýle zat ýok.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
It's hard for me.	Bu meniň üçin kyn.
I just thought it was possible	Diňe mümkin diýip pikir etdim
I didn't do anything about it	Men muňa hiç zat etmedim
Here's the question.	Ine sorag.
Not so with you.	Seniň bilen beýle däl.
He can still do something.	Ol henizem bir zatlar edip biler.
I have never seen it here	Men bu ýerde hiç wagt görmedim
I can't think of one right now	Häzirki wagtda birini pikir edip bilemok
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
These things will help you.	Bu zatlar size kömek eder.
Of course, there is an opinion on this.	Elbetde, bu barada pikir bar.
I knew in that look that he had succeeded	Munuň garşy däldigini bilýärdim
He asserted that his confession had been obtained through torture.	Munuň dogry däldigini aýtdy.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
He regained consciousness.	Ol özüne geldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu şeýle bolmaly.
I almost got something	Bir zat diýen ýaly aldym
I can't try.	Synap görüp bilemok.
He made it really big.	Ony hakykatdanam uly etdi.
It should be good.	Gowy bolmaly.
I still can't believe it	Men henizem ynanamok
I knew what he wanted	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärdim
I think maybe you should go home	Meniň pikirimçe, belki öýe gitmeli
I have been there several times	Men ol ýerde birnäçe gezek boldum
I didn't want to talk anymore.	Indi gürleşmek islemedim.
It's a job and it's just a job.	Bu bir iş we diňe bir iş.
I just had to say it out loud	Diňe muny gaty ses bilen aýtmaly boldum
They are new.	Olar täze.
In fact, it is not difficult.	Hakykatdanam, bu gaty kyn däl.
It was completely new to me.	Bu meniň üçin düýbünden täze boldy.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
So it was not a good idea	Şonuň üçin beýle gowy pikir däldi
I can't say for sure	Dogry diýip biljek däl
He could not say anything to her.	Oňa hiç zat aýdyp bilmedi.
I can't say no to him	Men oňa "ýok" diýip biljek däl
This was not surprising.	Bu geň däldi.
I saw you	Men seni gördüm
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
It's hard for us to talk.	Biz gürleşmek kyn.
A few girls.	Birnäçe gyz.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
It looks so easy.	Bu beýle aňsat görünýär.
Okay, that's better.	Bolýar, bu has gowy.
Really difficult decision.	Hakykatdanam kyn karar.
The work was beautiful.	Iş owadan boldy.
Of course I do.	Elbetde, şeýle edýärin.
I think it's good to go.	Meniň pikirimçe, gitmek gowy.
I knew it wasn't going to happen	Munuň asla mümkin däldigini bilýärdim
I know, but I don't know.	Bilýän, ýöne bilmeýän ýaly.
I was this guy.	Men bu ýigit boldum.
He told me everything.	Ol maňa hemme zady aýtdy.
I didn't care	Men bu barada alada etmedim
I haven't done this in a long time	Men muny köp wagt bäri etmedim
Just not there for me	Diňe, meniň üçin ol ýerde däl
Many hours.	Köp sagat.
He is a very beautiful and intelligent man.	Ol gaty owadan we akylly adam.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly zat.
I will think about you and him every day	Men sen hakda we ol hakda her gün pikir ederin
They are so beautiful.	Olar gaty ajaýyp.
I already loved it so much	Men ony eýýäm gaty gowy gördüm
He had to do it himself.	Muny özi etmeli boldy.
For this I am new, please	Munuň üçin men täze, haýyş edýärin
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
I shouldn't have done that.	Men beýle etmeli däldim.
This thought bothered me.	Bu pikir meni biynjalyk etdi.
Just an idea.	Diňe bir pikir.
I couldn't sleep last night	Düýn gije uklap bilmedim
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
He could see now.	Ol indi görüp bilýärdi.
He never did.	Ol hiç haçan etmedi.
There was really no money.	Hakykatdanam pul ýokdy.
I have to do things right	Men zatlary dogry etmeli
I thought before, he thought.	Öň pikir etdim, diýip pikir etdi.
No one can really help.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam kömek edip bilmez.
You are the only one	Sen diňe sen
There was time for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin wagt bardy.
He could do that, he could do that.	Ol muny edip bilýärdi, nädip bilýärdi.
He is the most.	Ol iň köp.
It wasn't really me.	Bu aslynda men däldi.
This is also easy.	Bu hem aňsat.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
I didn't have to be anywhere else	Başga bir ýerde bolmaly däldim
Once or twice.	Bir gezek ýa-da ikisi.
Only once.	Diňe bir gezek.
I never knew.	Hiç haçan bilmedim.
Something strange happened.	Geň bir zat boldy.
I need something you know	Maňa bilýän zadyň gerek
What are we	Biz näme
It should be.	Bolmaly.
Of course, he was no more.	Elbetde, ol indi ýokdy.
That's how good it was that day.	Ine, şol gün nähili gowy.
I couldn't get enough	Men ýeterlik bolup bilmedim
Two weeks as before.	Iki hepde öňküsi ýaly.
I will do whatever I want	Islän zadyny ederin
I did these things for him.	Men bu zatlary onuň üçin etdim.
Nothing else	Başga zat ýok
I couldn't do that with anyone else	Başga biri bilen beýle zatlary edip bilmedim
I did nothing	Men hiç zat etmedim
I can't answer it	Men oňa jogap berip bilemok
I just had a clear idea	Mende diňe bir aýdyň pikir bardy
This is difficult.	Bu kyn.
I think today is a good day	Bu gün gowy gün diýip pikir edýärin
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
I tried it everywhere.	Men hemme ýerde synap gördüm.
I hope someone can help me.	Biri maňa kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
One thing and another.	Bir zat we başga bir zat.
Something will happen.	Bir zat bolar.
I couldn't go home, not yet	Öýe gaýdyp bilmedim, entek däl
We are not.	Biz beýle däl.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
I need a few more days	Maňa ýene birnäçe gün gerek
Of course, today is not the day.	Elbetde, bu gün gün däl.
I can't do anything	Men hiç zat edip bilemok
I am very happy about that.	Men muňa gaty begenýärin.
They have to go.	Olar gitmeli.
And then it gets worse.	Soň bolsa has erbet bolýar.
To give you what you need	Size zerur zatlary bermek üçin
It was good to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy boldy.
There is now.	Häzir bar.
There is only sound.	Diňe ses bar.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Islän zadyny edip bilýärdi.
For a big day.	Uly gün üçin.
He would be himself.	Ol özi bolardy.
He is not alone.	Ol ýeke däl.
Today was a great day.	Bu gün gaty gowy gün boldy.
You have to do the same.	Şeýle hem etmeli.
It was never just about that.	Bu hiç haçan diňe bu barada däldi.
It will do a great job, of course.	Elbetde, gaty gowy iş eder.
He can't agree.	Ol razy bolup bilmez.
He went home.	Öýüne gitdi.
You don't have to worry about me.	Sen meniň hakda alada etmeli däl.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
I know that now.	Men muny indi bilýärin.
What time is it now?	Indi ýene haýsy wagt?
It should always be that way	Elmydama şeýle bolmaly
Life is coming fast.	Durmuş çalt gelýär.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda bu köp bolýar.
I think that's a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
Not only that.	Diňe beýle däl.
I can't buy it	Men muny satyn alyp bilemok
I didn't know then.	Men şol wagt bilmedim.
I'm really sorry.	Men hakykatdanam bagyşlaň.
I have to be there	Men ol ýerde bolmaly
Here it is!	Ine, şu ýerde!
I gave him some advice, but it was not enough	Men oňa bir maslahat berdim, ýöne ýeterlik däldi
Not necessarily, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Hökman däl "-diýdi.
I just do.	Men diňe edýärin.
I really need it.	Maňa gaty gerek.
I'm there.	Men şol ýerde.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
We need it.	Biz oňa mätäç.
There was time.	Wagt bardy.
Just stop now.	Diňe şu wagt bes et.
I never thought he would do that	Onuň beýle zat etjekdigini hiç wagt pikir etmedim
Now we are alone.	Indi biz ýeke.
I have two things for you	Meniň saňa iki zat bar
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
I heard about it once	Men ol hakda bir gezek eşitdim
He must.	Ol hökman.
It's like something else.	Bu başga zat ýaly.
I could always talk to him	Men onuň bilen elmydama aýdyp bilýärdim
I think this is a good time	Meniň pikirimçe, bu wagt gowy zat
I have never had such a thing before	Mende öňem beýle zat ýokdy
He is not ready yet	Ol entek taýyn däl
Three people	Üç adam
I had to buy him something else.	Men oňa başga bir zat satyn almaly boldum.
He was really alone.	Ol hakykatdanam ýeke boldy.
I was not	Men beýle däldim
Not everyone can say that.	Muny hemmeler hakda aýdyp bolmaz.
There is no reason.	Sebäp ýok.
Of course you have to.	Elbetde etmeli.
I know, just an idea.	Bilýän, diňe bir pikir.
I have good news for you.	Size gowy habar aldym.
What should he do?	Ol näme etmeli?
That would be nice.	Bu gowy bolar.
I don’t know how he does it	Muny nädip edýändigini bilemok
It could be.	Bolup biler.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
I have a lot to do	Meniň etmeli köp zadym bar
It will be interesting, but not for them.	Bu gyzykly bolar, ýöne olar üçin däl.
I believe this will be good	Munuň gowy boljakdygyna ynanýaryn
I think that's possible.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ähtimal.
I could only hope.	Men diňe umyt edip bilýärdim.
I was worried about you	Men sen hakda alada etdim
I couldn't help it.	Men muňa kömek edip bilmedim.
He said this twice.	Ol muny iki gezek aýtdy.
Bad things can never hurt you.	Erbet zatlar size hiç wagt zyýan berip bilmez.
Not to anyone.	Hiç kime däl.
He must have done this a long time ago.	Muny köp wagt öň eden bolmaly.
This can happen to you too.	Bu hem siziň üçin bolup biler.
This is very possible.	Bu gaty mümkin.
They will never be.	Olar asla bolmaz.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
It's interesting to talk about it.	Bu hakda onuň bilen gürleşmek gyzykly.
There is something wrong with that.	Ol ýerde dogry däl bir zat bar.
He wanted everyone to know that he had done this.	Her kimiň muny edenini bilmek isledi.
I am an adult	Men uly adam
This is absolutely.	Bu düýbünden.
Anyone can see.	Islän adam görüp biler.
I have never seen such a beautiful thing.	Men beýle owadan zady görmedim.
I know he wants to see you	Men seni görmek isleýändigini bilýärin
A little money	Biraz pul
No words.	Hiç hili söz ýok.
This is not just about us.	Bu diňe bir biz hakda däl.
I didn’t know what that could be	Munuň näme bolup biljekdigini bilmeýärdim
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
It's just the two of us.	Bu diňe ikimiz.
Not about that.	Bu hakda däl.
Maybe not now, not like before.	Belki, indi däl, öňküsi ýaly däl.
I think it was great	Meniň pikirimçe, gaty gowy boldy
There is nothing against it.	Oňa garşy hiç zat ýok.
I thought about it a lot	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I don't know why.	Näme üçin bolandygyny bilemok.
A lot of things.	Köp zat.
Interesting to see.	Görmek gyzykly.
He had to go.	Ol gitmeli boldy.
I didn’t want to answer that	Men muňa jogap bermek islemedim
Not good.	Gowy däl.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
He thought it would be good.	Ol gowy bolar diýip pikir etdi.
Not a word.	Söz däl.
The problem is, it won't happen again.	Mesele, mundan beýläk bolmaz.
He didn't need anything else.	Oňa başga zat gerek däldi.
He asked what was going on.	Ol näme bardygyny sorady.
He is already here.	Ol eýýäm şu ýerde.
I tried it once	Bir gezek synap gördüm
Life can be hard.	Durmuş kyn bolup biler.
It's just for you.	Ol siziň üçin diňe bir zat.
It will be like this many days in the morning.	Köp gün irden şeýle bolar.
Oh, very good.	Aý, gaty gowy.
I really don't know why.	Näme üçin hakykatdanam bilemok.
Of course, there is something for that.	Elbetde, munuň üçin bir zat bar.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
This is another question.	Bu başga sorag.
A little crazy.	Biraz däli.
It seems so stupid.	Bu gaty samsyk ýaly.
Only a few.	Diňe birnäçe.
He always knows what to do.	Elmydama näme etmelidigini bilýär.
I let him go	Men oňa gitmäge rugsat berdim
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
He must have thought about it three years ago	Bu pikir hakda üç ýyl ozal pikir eden bolmaly
I didn't have to do anything	Men hiç zat etmeli däldim
I thought it was really good	Hakykatdanam gowy boldy diýip pikir etdim
I will do many things	Men köp zatlar ederin
Nothing else will happen.	Başga hiç zat bolmaz.
Someone else is doing it better.	Başga biri muny has gowy edýär.
Right here.	Edil şu ýerde.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu seniň etjek zadyň.
I agreed and made several calls.	Men razy boldum we birnäçe jaň etdim.
He did not question it.	Ol muny sorag etmedi.
It was very bad this morning.	Şu gün irden gaty erbet boldy.
The only thing that really matters.	Hakykatdanam etmeli ýekeje zat.
An hour, one night, or a week later.	Bir sagat, bir gije ýa-da bir hepde soň.
I think I can do it this time	Bu gezek edip bilerin öýdýärin
She really cares.	Ol hakykatdanam alada edýär.
I hope you can help a little	Biraz kömek edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt edýärin
Not for much.	Köp zat üçin däl.
I'm not good enough	Men oňa ýeterlik däl
I want to talk to them	Men olar bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
I did nothing here	Men bu ýerde hiç zat etmedim
He is not. 	Ol beýle däl. 
I never worried about money	Men asla pul hakda alada etmedim
They really do exist.	Olar hakykatdanam bar.
They are not one thing.	Olar bir zat däl.
You will never be	Sen asla bolmaz
Good.	Gowy.
Nothing was very good for us.	Hiç zat biziň üçin gaty gowy däldi.
Great news.	Gaty gowy habar.
This is not a thing.	Bu bir zat däl.
I have it.	Ol mende bar.
You have to do whatever you want.	Islän zadyny etmeli.
This will be really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy bolar.
There are so many types it's hard to say	Häzirki wagtda gaty köp zat bar
I thought it would be a little easier	Bu birneme aňsat bolar öýdüpdim
It's good to do that.	Muny etmek gowy.
Better yet.	Has gowy.
I knew it could only happen.	Munuň diňe bir zat bolup biljekdigini bilýärdim.
You don't have to be like that.	Sen olar ýaly bolmaly däl.
I just wasn’t that good	Diňe beýle gowy däldim
I shouldn't have done that.	Men beýle etmeli däldim.
I couldn't sleep anymore	Men indi uklap bilmedim
I know, I don't have to go.	Bilýän, gitmeli däl.
It has happened several times.	Birnäçe gezek boldy.
This is not a book.	Bu beýle kitap däl.
This should not be too difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolmaly däl.
He knew now.	Ol indi bilýärdi.
He said no.	Asla beýle däl diýdi.
I am just.	Men diňe.
I think this looks great.	Bu gaty gowy görünýär diýip pikir edýärin.
He didn't pay attention to it for a few days.	Birnäçe gün muňa üns bermedi.
Of course, he is complete.	Elbetde, ol özüni doly.
I'm not there yet.	Men entek ýok.
I didn't know that before	Men ozal bilmedim
I think about them every day	Men olar hakda her gün pikir edýärin
No need to buy.	Satyn almak hökman däl.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
They were no longer there for him.	Olar häzir onuň üçin asla ýokdy.
In fact, this is not new news.	Aslynda bu täze habar däl.
There will be a reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi bolar.
Why? 	Näme üçin?
I must have called	Men jaň eden bolmaly
You are the only one.	Sen diňe bir.
You are one day older than me	Sen menden bir gün uly
He could make time.	Ol wagt edip bilýärdi.
He had to stop doing it for himself.	Özüne etmegi bes etmeli boldy.
Nothing will happen to him.	Oňa hiç zat bolmaz.
Maybe you'll be fine with that.	Belki, munuň bilen gowy bolarsyňyz.
In fact, he seemed happy.	Aslynda ol bagtly ýalydy.
I was a little worried	Biraz alada etdim
I paid a lot of attention to him	Men oňa gaty köp üns berdim
Both answers helped.	Iki jogap hem kömek etdi.
No one paid attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa üns bermedi.
Now he really wants one.	Indi ol hakykatdanam birini isleýär.
I never had a reason	Mende hiç wagt sebäp ýokdy
He knew this very well.	Ol muny gaty gowy bilýärdi.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
I didn’t think I should go there	Men ol ýere gitmeli diýip pikir etmedim
He told her the truth.	Ol oňa hakykaty aýtdy.
Not yet.	Entek ýok.
I think he's a good guy	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gowy ýigit
It's not good or bad.	Bu gowy ýa-da erbet däl.
This time he went with it	Bu gezek ol munuň bilen gitdi
It just seemed right.	Edil dogry zat ýalydy.
It was really fast.	Bu hakykatdanam çalt boldy.
I remember that.	Men muny ýatdan bilýärin.
It's a difficult task for a human being.	Adam üçin kyn mesele.
He is the same.	Ol hem edil şonuň ýaly.
He can be right.	Ol dogry aýdyp biler.
I had a bit of a hard time with you this morning	Şu gün irden saňa birneme kyn boldum
I didn't call anyone	Men hiç kime jaň etmedim
I haven't seen him again	Men ony indi görmedim
There was no such thing here.	Bu ýerde beýle zat ýokdy.
Maybe for them.	Belki olar üçin.
He knows he has to call.	Jaň etmelidigini bilýär.
I know what's going on there	Men ol ýerde näme bardygyny bilýärin
This is really huge for me.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň üçin gaty uly.
I am that person.	Men ol adam.
I will.	Men ederin.
Not everyone can say one thing.	Her kim bir zady aýdyp bilmez.
There are two more people in the house	Öýde ýene iki adam bar
I was mad at you at the time	Şol wagt saňa däli boldum
The biggest issue here.	Bu ýerde iň uly mesele.
I just can't get it today	Diňe şu gün alyp bilemok
I never saw him do that	Haçan muny edenini görmedim
I didn’t want to be here myself	Özüm bu ýerde bolmak islemedim
It's hard to do.	Işi etmek ýeterlik kyn.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
I never saw him.	Ony hiç haçan görmedim.
He really knew it.	Ol muny hakykatdanam bilýärdi.
This is for them.	Bu olar üçin.
He really did exist.	Ol hakykatdanam bardy.
Interesting, interesting, interesting !.	Gyzykly, gyzykly, gyzykly !.
I told him no	Men oňa munuň ýokdugyny aýtdym
I have to take it all with me now	Hemmesini indi özüm bilen almaly
I think so	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şeýle
This is one.	Bu bir.
It was a few years ago.	Mundan birnäçe ýyl ozal bardy.
Things are a little more interesting here.	Bu ýerde zatlar birneme gyzykly bolýar.
I can't get much	Men kän zat alyp bilemok
Right now	Şu wagt.
That's a good word.	Bu gowy söz.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I couldn't sleep last night	Düýn agşam uklap bilmedim
Three.	Üç.
He is one for you.	Ol siziň üçin bir.
I couldn't see it	Men muny görüp bilmedim
Nothing yet.	Entek hiç zat ýok.
I can call now	Häzir jaň edip bilerin
No time.	Wagt ýok.
Necessary.	Zerur.
he asked.	diýip sorady.
We are very close.	Biz gaty ýakyn.
It took a while.	Bu birneme wagt aldy.
I know there is still much to be done	Entek entek köp zadyň bardygyny bilýärin
He said again.	Ol ýene aýtdy.
He didn't think so.	Ol beýle däl diýip pikir etdi.
One, nothing stupid.	Biri, samsyk zat ýok.
Next time.	Indiki gezek.
So the song had to go.	Şonuň üçin aýdym gitmeli boldy.
He took her home.	Ol öýüne alyp gitdi.
It would be better for them.	Bu olar üçin has gowy bolardy.
Do it right this time	Bu gezek dogry et
Must be somewhere.	Bir ýerde bolmaly.
What's going on here?	Bu ýerde näme bolýar.
I gave it to him.	Men oňa berdim.
I've never done that before	Men ozal beýle zady etmedim
I had to give it to him	Men oňa bermeli boldum
I can't say anything about it	Men bu barada hiç zat aýdyp biljek däl
I think it's about time.	Meniň pikirimçe, wagt hakda.
The girl did everything.	Gyz hemme zady etdi.
Often they don’t want any help.	Köplenç hiç hili kömek islemeýär.
I can't say anything yet	Men entek hiç zat aýdyp biljek däl
We are really happy for you.	Biz siziň üçin hakykatdanam bagtly.
One day I might try this again.	Bir gün muny ýene synap görüp bilerin.
I haven’t done it in years	Birnäçe ýyl bäri etmedim
You or someone.	Siz ýa-da kimdir biri.
I didn't know about you	Men sen hakda bilmeýärdim
That's what happens.	Ine, şeýle bolýar.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat däldi.
Of course there is a mistake.	Elbetde ýalňyşlyk bar.
I have to do it myself	Muny özüm etmeli
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
I couldn't see it.	Men muny görüp bilmedim.
I know everything about you	Men sen hakda hemme zady bilýärin
Really nice guy	Hakykatdanam ajaýyp adam
Maybe not so bad.	Belki, beýle erbet däl bolsa gerek.
I didn't know that myself	Muny özüm bilmedim
I know what to do about it.	Bu barada näme etmelidigimi bilýärin.
The last thing to go.	Iň soňky gitmeli zat.
Few people knew.	Birnäçe adam bilýärdi.
I never thought he would do such a thing	Munuň ýaly bir zat etjekdigini asla pikir etmedim
This is everywhere.	Bu hemme ýerde.
I thought he could help you	Ol size kömek edip biler öýdüpdim
That was not the case.	Bu mesele däldi.
For two or three weeks, even.	Iki ýa-da üç hepde, hatda.
I didn't care about anyone but me	Menden başga hiç kim hakda alada etmedim
I thought it would be good	Gowy bolar öýdüpdim
I didn't see it.	Men ony görmedim.
Maybe someone would be home.	Belki kimdir biri öýde bolardy.
I didn't know much about him.	Men ol hakda köp zat bilmeýärdim.
No one else can do that.	Muny başga hiç kim edip bilmez.
I have decided that tomorrow will be a good day	Men karar berdim, ertir gowy gün bolar
He is not me, not now.	Ol meni däl, häzir däl.
You need to rest a little	Biraz dynç almaly
They are no more.	Indi olar ýok.
In fact, it was two years late.	Aslynda iki ýyl gijä galdy.
He does.	Ol şeýle edýär.
He couldn't see it, but he didn't have to.	Ony görüp bilmedi, ýöne soň gerek däldi.
This is the last thing he did.	Bu onuň iň soňky eden işi.
And so it was.	Şeýle hem boldy.
I can't let that happen	Men muny etmäge rugsat berip bilemok
It didn't look bad.	Erbet däl ýalydy.
Maybe he will too.	Belki, ol hem eder.
I am very happy to do that	Muny etmäge gaty begenýärin
I didn't see that.	Men muny görmedim.
Bad bad	Erbet erbet.
Everything is right.	Hemme zat dogry.
I have to be that way, please	Mende şeýle bolmaly, haýyş edýärin
I never saw him	Men ony hiç wagt görmedim
He got it all.	Ol hemmesini aldy.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I'm sorry about that	Men oňa gynanýaryn
It will be like this tomorrow.	Ertir şeýle bolar.
I thought it would be good	Gowy bolar öýdüpdim
He didn't have to do anything good.	Gowy bir zat etmeli däldi.
It's hard to see.	Muny görmek kyn.
I can help you and you	Men size we size kömek edip bilerin
I don't need any help.	Maňa hiç hili kömek gerek däl.
This is what happened here.	Bu ýerde şeýle boldy.
I can't promise it.	Men muňa söz berip bilemok.
Well, that's right.	Gowy, dogry.
These are very difficult things.	Bu gaty kyn zatlar.
That's what he wants.	Bu onuň isleýän zady.
I told her things, but she didn't tell me the truth	Men oňa zatlar aýtdym, ýöne hakykaty däl
This is not an idea.	Bu pikir däl.
I still don't want to think about it	Men entek bu hakda pikir etmek islemedim
It will no longer be necessary.	Mundan beýläk zerur bolmaz.
I thought we could do it with someone	Biri bilen edip bileris öýdüpdim
This is not very difficult.	Bu gaty bir kyn däl.
No one has done this before.	Muny öň hiç kim etmedi.
Not much else.	Başga kän däl.
Meat, meat, meat.	Et, et, et.
I still want to do that	Men henizem muny etmek isleýärin
Good.	Gowy.
One hour, two hours, three hours.	Bir sagat, iki sagat, üç sagat.
I never wanted to destroy someone else	Men hiç haçan başga birini ýok etmek islemedim
Good, really good.	Gowy, hakykatdanam gowy.
I can't tell you about it anymore	Indi bu hakda size aýdyp biljek däl
Of course I said.	Elbetde aýtdym.
I did what I wanted	Men islän zadyny etdim
I didn’t know if this was something for me	Munuň meniň üçin bir zadyň bardygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny bilmedim
I heard a sound at night	Gije bir ses eşitdim
I think they have so much fun	Meniň pikirimçe, olar şeýle bir hezil
Okay.	Bolýar.
You are not a good person	Sen gowy adam däl
I can see you next week	Geljek hepde sizi görüp bilerin
I didn't have to say that.	Men muny aýtmaly däldim.
You can go	Siz gidip bilersiňiz
I gave him what he needed	Men oňa zerur zatlary berdim
I was ready for it	Men oňa taýyn boldum
Not just a little bit, just a little bit.	Diňe biraz köp däl, diňe birneme köp däl.
I thought he did a good job	Gowy iş etdi öýdüpdim
Of course man.	Elbetde adam.
I did not know	Bilmedim.
Not at all.	Hiç zat bilen däl.
You don't think so.	Siziň pikiriňizçe bolmaz.
What a wonderful day it was!	Bu nähili ajaýyp gün boldy.
They are not the only option.	Olar diňe bir mümkinçilik däl.
Not a good idea at all.	Hiç haçan gowy pikir däl.
He thought he couldn't do that to us.	Ol muny bize edip bilmez diýip pikir etdi.
Everything was there, everything he wanted and more.	Hemme zat bardy, islän zady we başga zatlar.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly zat.
Just two weeks.	Diňe iki hepde.
I am very lonely.	Men gaty ýeke.
I didn't want to	Men ol wagt islemedim
I think that should be the case.	Meniň pikirimçe şeýle bolmaly.
He will not object.	Ol birneme garşy bolmaz.
This is a really good thing.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy iş.
She was worried.	Ol alada galdy.
Not interesting anymore.	Indi gyzykly däl.
It's not like you.	Bu seniň ýaly däl.
I just thought the time had come	Diňe wagt geldi öýdüpdim
I didn't care	Men muňa alada etmedim
He did everything together.	Hemme zady bilelikde etdi.
Nothing really can happen.	Hakykatdanam, hiç zat bolup bilmez.
I know that.	Men bu hakda bilýärin.
The time was short.	Wagt gysga boldy.
There are two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar.
He was there too.	Ol hem bardy.
He could have gone there.	Ol şol ýere gidip bilýärdi.
And then he didn't.	Soň bolsa etmedi.
I don't want anything from you	Men senden hiç zat islämok
The problem is you.	Mesele sen.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I didn't see myself that way	Özümi beýle görmedim
This did not help.	Bu kömek etmedi.
I can give you what you need	Size zerur zatlary berip bilerin
I was very close to him	Men oňa gaty ýakyn boldum
I could not go.	Men gidip bilmedim.
It looks great, of course.	Elbetde, gaty gowy görünýär.
No one wanted to.	Hiç kim islemedi.
In fact, he had to go to school.	Hakykatdanam, ol mekdebe gitmeli boldy.
I had no problem	Mende hiç hili mesele ýokdy
Someone has to do it.	Kimdir biri etmeli.
He seems to know a few things.	Birnäçe zady bilýän ýaly.
I always thought of him	Men ol hakda hemişe pikir etdim
There was worse news.	Has erbet habar bardy.
I think it will be good	Gowy bolar öýdýän
Me or mine.	Men ýa-da meniň.
You always	Siz elmydama.
There seemed to be no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýok ýalydy.
Can anyone help me?	Maňa kömek edip biljek barmy?
He knows this well.	Ol muny gowy bilýär.
I will not be alone anymore	Men mundan beýläk ýeke bolmaz
This is very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal.
I knew it was for me	Munuň meniň üçin bolandygyny bilýärdim
He wants to talk to you.	Ol siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýär.
He hopes.	Ol umyt edýär.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
Will be back tomorrow.	Ertir gaýdyp geler.
Of course he will.	Elbetde eder.
So it was difficult for him.	Şonuň üçin bu onuň üçin kyn boldy.
Not really many people.	Bu hakykatdanam kän adam däl.
I think that's all	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hemme zat
He thought it was good.	Gowy, diýip pikir etdi.
It would be easy.	Bu aňsat bolardy.
That morning.	Şol gün irden.
I can't think of it	Men bu hakda pikir edip bilemok
I have to be somewhere	Men bir ýerde bolmaly
I want to do better	Has gowy etmek isleýärin
A bad voice called.	Erbet ses jaň etdi.
I couldn't sleep well	Men gowy uklap bilmedim
Life is not like that.	Durmuş beýle däl.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
Something.	Bir hili zat.
I often think so.	Men köplenç şeýle pikir edýärin.
We are like them.	Biz olar ýaly.
No one called him.	Hiç kim oňa jaň etmedi.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle.
It will take several years.	Birnäçe ýyl gerek bolar.
He didn't have to say much.	Oňa has köp zat aýtmak gerek däldi.
I think it's good to go	Meniň pikirimçe, gitmek gowy
I didn't have to do that	Men muny etmeli däldim
It takes a while to get a few things	Birnäçe zady almak üçin biraz wagt gerek
This is because of you.	Munuň sebäbi seniň üçin.
That's all we need.	Edil bize gerek zat.
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
It will be easy.	Bu aňsat bolar.
He did a great job.	Ol gaty gowy iş etdi.
There is no weekend.	Dynç güni ýok.
I'm fine with that.	Men munuň bilen gowy boldum.
He was well aware of this.	Ol muny gowy bilýärdi.
I doubt this will happen much.	Munuň köp zat boljakdygyna şübhelenýärin.
You don't have to go this time.	Bu gezek gitmeli däl.
You can tell	Aýdyp bilersiňiz.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people	Munuň bardygyny bilmek gerek
He said sorry.	Bagyşlaň diýdi.
Talk to you soon	Siziň bilen gürleşmek
I knew nothing about it	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim
I have a lot to do	Meniň etmeli köp zadym bar
Maybe it already exists.	Belki, eýýäm bar.
Also.	Şeýle hem.
There is no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýok.
I'm there and right now	Men şol ýerde we häzirki wagtda
I think that's what happened to him	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hem onuň üçin edil şonuň ýaly boldy
Here they are.	Ine, olar şol ýerde.
I am not.	Men beýle däl.
You can do it at night.	Gije edip bilersiňiz.
That's not enough.	Ol ýeterlik däl.
It's me.	Bu men.
He was already there.	Ol öňem bardy.
I can say everything	Men hemme zady aýdyp bilerin
He is different from me.	Ol menden başga.
I know this may sound strange	Munuň geň bolup biljekdigini bilýärin
I haven't seen anyone else here all day	Bütin gün bu ýerde başga birini görmedim
We just need a good person.	Bize diňe gowy adam gerek.
I thought of you.	Men, seni pikir etdim.
Then a little more.	Soň ýene birneme.
It was just like him.	Edil edil özi ýalydy.
I did not want to know	Bilmek islemedim.
I have to be here for them	Men olar üçin şu ýerde bolmaly
I could be worse	Men has erbet bolup bilerin
OK, he thought.	Bolýar, diýip pikir etdi.
I took the time to talk to her this morning	Şu gün irden onuň bilen gürleşmek üçin wagt aldym
It's always a mistake.	Elmydama ýalňyşlyk.
I thought about you	Men sen hakda pikir etdim
He called her.	Ol oňa jaň etdi.
He asked for help.	Kömek isledi.
He reported the worst to her.	Iň erbet pikir edip, oňa habar berdi.
he asked	diýip sorady
I wanted to do one	Birini etjek boldum
That’s how I got it and relaxed	Men muny şeýle aldym we dynç aldym
I didn't want to ask you a question	Men senden sorag bermek islemedim
I don't think he told me the whole truth.	Ol maňa doly hakykaty aýtdy öýdemok.
Good.	Gowy.
I know he wants to help.	Kömek etmek isleýändigini bilýärin.
It should be good.	Gowy bolmaly.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
A lot of money.	Köp pul.
This is not the case.	Mesele beýle däl.
He came out and really did.	Ol çykdy we hakykatdanam etdi.
I know, but what he doesn't know can't hurt him	Bilýärin, ýöne bilmeýän zady oňa zyýan berip bilmeýär
I can't say why right now	Näme üçin edil şu wagt aýdyp biljek däl
There was one thing and another.	Bir zatlar we başga zatlar bardy.
I think you have to do that	Meniň pikirimçe, muny hökman etmeli
He allowed it.	Ol oňa mümkinçilik berdi.
I think that's right	Bu dogry diýip pikir edýärin
We need to help him.	Biz oňa kömek etmeli.
I think you should take a break	Biraz dynç almaly diýip pikir edýärin
Handsome man	Owadan adam.
She has to help herself.	Özüne kömek etmeli.
This is not possible.	Bu beýle mümkin däl.
I knew it wasn't going to happen	Munuň bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärdim
A beautiful girl like you should not be alone	Seniň ýaly owadan gyz ýeke bolmaly däl
One sound or sound may be different	Bir ses ýa-da ses başga bolup biler
It was a strange night.	Bu geň gije boldy.
It's great to see that.	Muny görmek gaty gowy.
It can't happen anymore.	Indi bolup bilmez.
There was really no one to tell	Hakykatdanam aýdyp biljek adam ýokdy
I really want to talk to you.	Men hakykatdanam siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
Good.	Gowy.
This time it is not possible.	Bu gezek mümkin däl.
He could control himself.	Ol özüni alyp bilýärdi.
A few hours ago.	Birnäçe sagat öň.
The most beautiful thing.	Iň owadan zat.
Here are a few things to do.	Ine, hökman etmeli birnäçe zat.
They look happy.	Olar bagtly ýaly görünýär.
I am always with you	Men elmydama seniň bilen
I think you can be right	Dogry aýdyp bilersiňiz öýdýän
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
And then the question.	Soň bolsa sorag.
You have to tell him what happened.	Näme bolandygyny oňa aýtmaly.
It will come in time.	Wagt bilen geler.
He said no.	Ol indi ýok diýdi.
I gave it to him	Men oňa berdim
This is the first time I've seen it	Men muny ilkinji gezek gördüm
I haven't been able to get it yet	Men henizem alyp bilmedim
I couldn’t be mad at that	Men muňa däli bolup bilmedim
I couldn't sleep	Men uklap bilmedim
Bad, bad luck.	Erbet, erbet kynçylyk.
This makes you weird.	Bu size geň zatlar edýär.
I can't do that to you anymore	Indi muny saňa edip bilemok
It's very easy to see.	Muny görmek gaty aňsat.
I want to do the same	Edil şonuň ýaly etmek isleýärin
And then there's everyone else.	Soň bolsa başga hemmeler bar.
I saw and heard it	Men muny gördüm we eşitdim
It was a fun night.	Bu gije hezil boldy.
I want to be a little more prepared.	Biraz has taýyn bolmak isleýärin.
I think it will be sooner	Has ir bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I can't see myself with him	Men onuň bilen özümi görüp bilemok
You may be next.	Indiki bolup bilersiňiz.
Of course, he didn't know the first thing.	Elbetde, ol bu barada ilkinji zady bilmeýärdi.
Once upon a time there was a reason for this.	Bir gezek munuň sebäbi bardy.
This is difficult.	Bu kyn.
I'm still thinking about it.	Men henizem ol hakda pikir edýärin.
I couldn't think of a word	Hiç hili söz hakda pikir edip bilmedim
I can't	Edip bilemok
Not so with him.	Onuň bilen beýle däl.
I said it would be	Boljakdygyny aýtdym
It will be easy for us.	Bu biziň üçin aňsat bolar.
I can't take it anymore	Indi alyp bilemok
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däl.
It's not like anything else.	Bu başga hiç zat ýaly däl.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
There seemed to be nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýok ýalydy.
This is a very difficult task.	Bu gaty kyn iş.
Maybe in the near future, but not yet.	Belki ýakyn wagtda, ýöne entek ýok.
I just can't do it	Diňe muny edip bilemok
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu beýle däl.
He could not see anyone.	Ol hakda hiç kimi görüp bilmedi.
I think this is a mistake	Bu ýalňyşlyk diýip pikir edýärin
I was not bad	Mende erbet däldi
I know a lot about you	Men sen hakda köp zat bilýärin
.	.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
After that, I was left with only one thing	Mundan soň diňe ýekeje zadym galdy
It's time to dump her and move on.	Üns bermeli wagt.
I didn't want to be there	Men ol ýerde bolmak islemedim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň üçin gowy zat.
I thought about leaving	Men gitmek hakda pikir etdim
I didn't care	Men ol hakda alada etmedim
It could be him.	Bu onuň bolup biler.
I knew you were there	Seniň bardygyny bilýärdim
The next thing.	Indiki zat.
It was the same with him.	Ol hem edil şonuň ýalydy.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Gaty jogap üçin bagyşlaň.
Oh, please.	Aý, haýyş edýärin.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
This has happened once.	Bu bir gezek boldy.
He did it again.	Ol ýene etdi.
I want to be alone for that	Munuň üçin ýeke bolmak isleýärin
I didn't want to do that	Men muny etmek islemedim
This, of course, will not happen.	Bu, elbetde, asla bolmaz.
I thought about it a lot	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim
Good, good.	Gowy, gowy.
He is crazy about you.	Ol sen hakda däli.
I called him, but he didn't answer me	Men oňa jaň etdim, ýöne ol maňa jogap bermedi
I could not exist	Men bar bolup bilmedim
How can I do that?	Muny nädip edip bilerin?
What a stupid question to ask.	Näme samsyk sorag bermeli.
I had to do that before	Muny öňem etmeli boldum
I can still do that	Men henizem muny edip bilerin
we can	edip bileris.
I haven't seen it in years	Birnäçe ýyl bäri görmedim
he asked.	diýip sorady.
I thought it might be good	Bu gowy bolup biler diýip pikir etdim
I must have called him already	Men oňa eýýäm jaň eden bolmaly
Anyone can say something.	Her kim bir zat aýdyp biler.
I just want to	Men diňe isleýärin
I have a tip	Mende bir maslahat bar
I need to rest tonight	Maňa şu gije dynç almaly
I hope he can't tell	Ol aýdyp bilmez diýip umyt etdim
Every time.	Her gezek.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
We can't do that.	Muny edip bilmeris.
I couldn't get it	Men muny alyp bilmedim
I can't speak for everyone	Hemmeler üçin gürläp bilemok
That's it.	Ine, şeýle.
They are not something like that.	Olar munuň ýaly zat däl.
That's what he did for me.	Ine, ol meniň üçin etdi.
I had no such thing	Mende beýle zatlar ýokdy
Someone else and he would be.	Başga biri we ol bolardy.
He cannot speak or think like a man.	Adam ýaly gürläp ýa-da pikir edip bilmeýär.
It seems to be somewhere else.	Başga bir ýerde bolýan ýaly.
It's very interesting to see that	Muny görmek gaty gyzykly
This is really difficult.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn.
He is good.	Ol gowy.
He was just like that.	Ol edil edil şonuň ýalydy.
I'm not sure yet	Men entek doly ynanamok
Now say it carefully.	Indi muny üns bilen aýdyň.
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
I visited there once	Men ol ýere bir gezek baryp gördüm
I have never seen anything like it.	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim.
I know it exists.	Men onuň bardygyny bilýärin.
This is not the only case.	Bu diňe beýle däl.
He does too.	Ol hem edýär.
I had.	Mende bardy.
No wonder here.	Bu ýerde geň zat ýok.
The man did not pay attention to her.	Ol adam oňa üns bermedi.
It's you.	Bu sen.
It is not enough for you.	Ol siziň üçin ýeterlik däl.
I only have one thing for him	Mende onuň üçin diňe bir zat bar
Only one thing could be done.	Diňe bir zat edip bolardy.
I couldn't care less	Men alada edip bilmedim
He knew very well.	Ol gaty gowy bilýärdi.
I thought it was very beautiful.	Gaty owadan diýip pikir etdim.
This is very bad news.	Bu gaty erbet habar.
Someone else answered him.	Oňa başga biri jogap berdi.
Only if he can get a message to her.	Diňe oňa habar alyp bilýän bolsa.
You didn't have to be here	Bu ýerde bolmak hökman däldi
I can't see it that way	Men ony beýle görüp bilemok
No questions asked.	Sorag ýok.
He is just.	Ol diňe.
I told her I was crazy	Men oňa aýdyp, däli boldum
I want to go home and	Öýe gitmek isleýärin we
It's easier to do it once.	Bir gezek etmek has aňsat.
Someone had to do that	Kimdir biri muny etmeli boldy
Not such a good idea.	Beýle gowy pikir däl.
How to do this?	Muny nädip etmeli?
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
The same is true for me.	Bu meniň üçin hem edil şonuň ýaly.
I will always be there for you	Men elmydama siziň üçin bolaryn
I told you a few times	Men saňa birnäçe gezek aýtdym
He did it next year.	Indiki ýyl etdi.
So the young man responded quickly and quickly.	Şonuň üçin bu ýigit çalt we çalt jogap berdi.
I know this is possible	Munuň nädip mümkin bolup biljekdigini bilýärin
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
I have never seen anything like it	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim
Of course, no one thought about it.	Elbetde, bu barada hiç kim pikir etmedi.
It happened in a very short time.	Bu gaty gysga wagtda boldy.
He has to go.	Ol gitmeli.
This is not the time for this.	Bu munuň üçin wagt däl.
Then he wanted to go home.	Soň bolsa öýüne gitmek isledi.
I have never seen anything like it	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim
I thought it was great	Ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim
I can't say what he thinks	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini aýdyp bilemok
This thought did not bother me.	Bu pikir meni biynjalyk etmedi.
The money was not bad.	Pul erbet däldi.
Not so for the last three.	Soňky üç üçin beýle däl.
Okay.	Bolýar.
That would be great.	Bu gaty uly bolar.
I want to do that.	Men muny etmek isleýärin.
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
Not one.	Biri däl.
I couldn't quite tell what he was doing	Men onuň näme edýändigini doly aýdyp bilmedim
Maybe next.	Belki indiki.
You can go.	Siz baryp bilersiňiz.
There was no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýokdy.
I know this can't be easy.	Munuň aňsat bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärin.
He didn't care about anything else at the time.	Ol şol wagt başga bir zat hakda alada etmedi.
This is the stupidest.	Bu iň samsyk.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
That's more.	Bu has köp.
I shouldn't be that hard	Men beýle kyn bolmaly däl
may be	bolup biler.
I care about him and him	Men oňa we ol hakda alada edýärin
That's right.	Dogry ýaly.
It must be hard.	Ol gaty bolmaly.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
It was bad.	Bu erbet boldy.
He will do so.	Şeýle eder.
I know a lot.	Men köp zady bilýärin.
Thinking the worst, I immediately responded	Iň erbet pikir edip, derrew jogap berdim
I still have.	Mende henizem bar.
I couldn't care less	Alada edip bilmedim
I hoped everything would be fine	Hemme zat gowy bolar diýip umyt etdim
He is not alone as he is.	Ol özi ýaly ýeke däl.
The last word.	Soňky söz.
This is more money for us.	Bu biziň üçin has köp pul.
Whatever.	Näme bolsa.
He took it.	Ol ony aldy.
Of course he is.	Elbetde, ol.
Not good, but good.	Gowy däl, ýöne gowy.
He wants to see you too.	Ol hem seni görmek isleýär.
I don't want money	Men pul islämok
Here it is today.	Ine, şu gün.
I had to do it.	Men muny etmeli boldum.
This is a strange thing.	Bu bir geň zat.
It will not be necessary.	Bu zerur bolmaz.
I think this is the only one	Bu ýeke-täk bar diýip pikir edýärin
What happened	Näme boldy?
He was still there.	Ol henizem bardy.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I can't take it anywhere	Men ony hiç ýere alyp bilemok
There was something strange about him.	Ol hakda geň bir zat bardy.
I think that's the only thing	Meniň pikirimçe, bu diňe bir zat
I think they always were	Meniň pikirimçe, olar hemişe bardy
No one likes it.	Hiç kim ony halamaýar.
I was not good.	Men gowy däldim.
That's what happened.	Ol şeýle boldy.
Many years ago.	Köp ýyl mundan ozal.
Those two.	Şol ikisi.
The answer is no.	Jogap, ýok.
I saw it last week.	Men ony geçen hepde gördüm.
He got what he wanted.	Islän zadyny aldy.
I just want to be needed	Men diňe zerur bolmak isleýärin
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men munuň mümkin däldigini aýtdym
Ready to go home.	Öýe gitmäge taýyn.
This year he was the best.	Bu ýyl ol iň gowy boldy.
I wanted to give myself to him, he thought	Özümi oňa bermek isleýärin, diýip pikir etdi
He called right.	Dogry jaň etdi.
Being right is one thing.	Dogry bolmak bir zat.
I want a lot to do	Men muny etmek üçin köp zat isleýärin
I think he'll do it very well	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny gaty gowy eder
No one wanted to talk about it.	Hiç kim bu hakda gürleşmek islemedi.
It was never enough.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik däldi.
It doesn't seem like much.	Kän ýaly däl ýaly.
I didn't even see it.	Men muny hatda görmedim.
I can't get it right	Men muny dogry alyp bilemok
I couldn't think of anything	Men asla pikir edip bilmedim
Of course they were.	Elbetde, olar bardy.
I have something to worry about	Meniň alada etmeli zadym bar
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
You and he	Sen we ol.
There was something wrong.	Dogry däl bir zat bardy.
Now this is interesting.	Indi bu gyzykly.
I have nothing	Mende hiç zat ýok
I had a very strange year	Mende gaty geň ýyl boldy
Great and good for them.	Ajaýyp, olar üçin gowy.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
Better yet.	Has gowy.
Of course, he started taking it.	Elbetde, ony alyp başlady.
I was great for you	Men siziň üçin ajaýyp boldum
We have to go.	Biz gitmeli.
We are not.	Biz beýle däl.
He resigned.	Ol işden çykdy.
He also did not tell the truth.	Ol hem hakykaty aýtmady.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Dogry zatlary ýok.
I don't know what.	Men näme bilemok.
I couldn't help it	Oňa kömek edip bilmedim
I can't be that stupid	Men beýle samsyk bolup bilemok
Good.	Gowy.
I hope you can do it	Hakykatdanam edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt edýärin
That could be the case.	Bu şeýle bolup biler.
I had to keep myself busy	Özümi meşgul etmeli boldum
Of course.	Elbetde.
He didn't tell you anything.	Ol size bu barada hiç zat aýtmady.
It was crazy.	Bu däli boldy.
I need more.	Maňa has köp zat gerek.
I just need to see	Meni diňe görmek gerek
Nor can he.	Şeýle hem, edip bilmeýär.
It was very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly boldy.
Does he know or not?	Bilýärmi ýa dälmi?
I have very bad news	Mende gaty erbet habar bar
I gave everything	Men hemme zady berdim
Of course not.	Elbetde ýok.
This is one.	Bu bir.
I gave him a lot.	Men oňa köp zat berdim.
This is not a new idea.	Bu täze pikir däl.
I have	Mende bar.
I can't say anymore	Indi aýdyp biljek däl
I never saw him again	Men ony ýene görmedim
It's very difficult to do that.	Muny etmek gaty kyn.
He couldn't think of anything.	Ol hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilmedi.
I can't see how doing more can help me.	Has köp iş etmegiň maňa nähili kömek etjekdigini görüp bilemok.
I could not go to him	Men oňa baryp bilmedim
That's what happened.	Şeýle boldy.
He wants to tell everyone the truth.	Her kime hakykaty aýtmak isleýär.
I could always only visit	Elmydama diňe baryp görüp bilýärdim
I think this is very difficult	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty kyn
I was worried	Meni biynjalyk etdi
This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
He will not be at home.	Ol öýde bolmaz.
I told you and I told you already	Men saňa aýtdym we eýýäm aýtdym
To answer.	Jogap bermek üçin.
It didn't have to be this big.	Munuň ýaly uly zat bolmaly däldi.
He may be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolup biler.
This is the last time he did this.	Ol muny iň soňky gezek etdi.
This girl.	Bu gyz.
I saw you	Men seni gördüm
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
It looks great.	Gaty gowy görünýär.
Maybe in the near future.	Belki ýakyn wagtda.
This will not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaz.
We are beautiful	Biz owadan.
I must have called you	Men saňa jaň eden bolmaly
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
No one can do anything.	Hiç kim hiç zat edip bilmez.
Man, that would be great.	Adam, gaty gowy bolardy.
Of course he did.	Elbetde, muny etdi.
I can't do that	Men muny edip bilemok
I can't go back to work yet	Men entek işe gaýdyp bilemok
It can't be here.	Bu ýerde bolup bilmez.
He doesn't want to go.	Ol gitmek islemeýär.
That's right.	Dogry.
Now only two.	Indi diňe ikisi.
So it's easy for me to talk about it.	Şonuň üçin bu hakda gürleşmek maňa aňsat.
I never had so much fun	Hiç haçan beýle hezil etmedim
It was never enough.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik däldi.
I know this can only happen tonight	Munuň diňe şu gije bolup biljekdigini bilýärin
And then I thought so badly	Soň bolsa gaty erbet pikir etdim
Definitely good.	Elbetde, gowy.
About me.	Men hakda.
It is close, very close.	Bu ýakyn, gaty ýakyn.
It has always been, always will be.	Elmydama boldy, hemişe bolar.
I just didn't know what it was going to be like	Diňe munuň nähili boljakdygyny bilmedim
That's great.	Bu ajaýyp zat.
I can't vote	Men ses berip bilemok
Not a good idea.	Gowy pikir däl.
I didn't have to go.	Men gitmeli däldim.
I haven't thought about it yet	Men entek pikir etmedim
Great night in a great place	Ajaýyp ýerde ajaýyp gije
There may be two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bolup biler.
It was not necessary to say it out loud	Ony gaty ses bilen aýtmak hökman däldi
I wanted to do something good for you	Men size gowy zat etjek boldum
No other way.	Başga ýol däl.
Okay, really.	Bolýar, hakykatdanam.
No harm done.	Zyýan ýok.
I have to be with him	Men onuň bilen bolmaly
And today it was "just like that."	Bu gün bolsa "edil şonuň ýaly" boldy.
This is a complete lie.	Bu düýbünden ýalan.
Bar.	Bar.
In fact, it's about doing the right thing.	Aslynda, zerur zatlary etmek hakda.
It's been here for a month.	Bir aý bäri şu ýerde.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
I had.	Mende bardy.
To go with him.	Onuň bilen gitmäge.
This was also not true.	Bu hem dogry däldi.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
You are young	Sen ýigit.
Really good time	Aslynda gowy wagt
I took it three times	Men ony üç gezek aldym
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
I was in a very difficult place	Men gaty kyn ýerde boldum
There are three reasons for this.	Munuň üç sebäbi bar.
I haven't seen it yet, nothing can happen	Men entek görmedim, hiç zat bolup bilmez
I heard a voice.	Men bir ses eşitdim.
So very beautiful.	Şonuň üçin gaty owadan.
And then nothing.	Soň bolsa hiç zat.
It may be the last	Iň soňky bolmagy mümkin
I was not ready for that	Men muňa taýyn däldim
What's up	Näme bolýar?
Interesting night	Gyzykly gije.
There were several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bardy.
He wants me right away.	Derrew meni isleýär.
I've heard a lot about you	Men sen hakda köp eşitdim
I'll call you there	Men saňa şol ýerde jaň ederin
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
And I'm crazy	Men bolsa däli
We can't talk about tomorrow.	Ertir hakda aýdyp bilmeris.
Talking about things helps.	Zatlar bilen gürleşmek kömek edýär.
No one was anywhere.	Hiç kim hiç ýerde ýokdy.
I thought there was enough meat	Et ýeterlik diýip pikir etdim
Of course, he is a very young man.	Elbetde, ol gaty ýaş ýigit bolýar.
I have to give it to you	Men saňa bermeli
I just know it happened.	Bolandygyny diňe bilýärin.
I've heard so much already	Men eýýäm gaty köp eşitdim
You have to get it.	Ony almaly.
Who will be next?	Indiki kim bolar?
It will be.	Bu bolar.
I can't even speak	Men hatda gürläp bilemok
I'm so stupid	Men gaty samsyk.
I told you he was crazy about you.	Saňa aýtdym, ol sen hakda däli.
I did.	Men etdim.
This is very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal.
I just can't do it for you right now	Diňe şu wagt saňa edip bilemok
What, what.	Näme, näme.
Because there is no one here who can help.	Sebäbi bu ýerde kömek edip biljek hiç kim ýok.
And then you have to decide.	Soň bolsa karar bermeli.
He is a wonderful man.	Ol ajaýyp adam.
I really can't say.	Men hakykatdanam aýdyp biljek däl.
I can't think of it	Men bu hakda pikir edip bilemok
She wants to help.	Kömek etmek isleýär.
Too many people.	Gaty köp adam.
I have never been able to do such a thing	Men hiç wagt beýle zatlary edip bilmedim
Big big	Uly uly
He did not want to go home.	Öýüne gitmek islemedi.
You are absolutely	Siz düýbünden.
I can't think of it	Men bu hakda pikir edip bilemok
I thought it was just me.	Men diňe özüm diýip pikir etdim.
I don't know anything about myself	Men özüm hakda hiç zat bilemok
I can do it or someone else.	Men ýa-da başga birini edip bilerin.
There is nothing else I can say about it.	Bu hakda aýdyp biljek başga zat ýok.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
In fact, it's not too bad.	Aslynda bu gaty erbet däl.
When did you come	Haçan geldi.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat däldi.
It took him all summer.	Oňa bütin tomus gerek boldy.
He did not ask any questions.	Ol hiç hili sorag bermedi.
Not there	Ol ýerde ýok
Not there.	Ol ýerde ýok.
He seemed unable to speak.	Ol gürläp bilmeýän ýalydy.
I'm sorry	Men gynanýaryn
This is not a big deal.	Bu gaty bir zat däl.
I am always	Men elmydama.
I thought it would take a while.	Oňa biraz wagt gerek diýip pikir etdim.
I've tried this before and couldn't.	Men muny öň synap gördüm we edip bilmedim.
Young at night.	Gije ýaş.
This is really strange.	Bu hakykatdanam geň.
I already had a day	Mende eýýäm bir gün bardy
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
Not such a big deal.	Munuň ýaly uly bir zat däl.
This is not for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin däl.
I called, but no one answered.	Men jaň etdim, ýöne hiç kim jogap bermedi.
Tell me! 	Aýdyň!
really	hakykatdanam.
I think there is a word for that.	Meniň pikirimçe, munuň üçin bir söz bar.
The problem is not right.	Mesele dogry däl.
Of course there is.	Elbetde bar.
What do you think is needed?	Siziň pikiriňizçe näme gerek?
I fully believe that	Men muňa doly ynanýaryn
So good.	Şonuň üçin gowy.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
I need someone who really wants to help	Maňa hakykatdanam kömek etmek isleýän biri gerek
I've tried this before	Muny öňem synap gördüm
The offer was not enough.	Teklip ýeterlik däldi.
I was like a fool	Men samsyk ýaly boldum
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hem onuň üçin, hem garşy.
It can help you.	Size kömek edip biler.
I didn't want to go.	Men gitmek islemedim.
It went with him.	Bu onuň bilen gitdi.
Man cannot harm.	Adam zyýan berip bilmez.
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa ýol bermedi.
It's beautiful.	Bu owadan.
It really is.	Hakykatdanam şeýle.
Maybe it will be easier for you.	Belki, bu siziň üçin has aňsat bolar.
He really knew it.	Ol muny hakykatdanam bilýärdi.
He was very good to us.	Ol bize gaty gowy boldy.
I can't say.	Men aýdyp biljek däl.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
No one paid attention.	Hiç kim muňa üns bermedi.
That was not the case.	Bu mesele däldi.
He knows what he knows.	Ol bilýän zadyny bilýär.
Things are coming to me.	Maňa zatlar gelýär.
It's great to be able to say that.	Muny aýdyp bilmek ajaýyp zat.
For the first time, I'm really scared	Men ilkinji gezek hakykatdanam gorkýaryn
Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
It's too short.	Bu gaty gysga.
He could not say it.	Ol muny aýdyp bilmedi.
You can really do that.	Muny hakykatdanam edip bilersiňiz.
It was a crazy night.	Bu däli gije boldy.
I couldn't take it anymore	Men muny indi alyp bilmedim
I can be very difficult with you	Men seniň bilen gaty kyn bolup bilerin
Of course, he did not ask the right question.	Elbetde, ol dogry sorag bermedi.
Now there is.	Indi bar.
It was never like the right time.	Hiç haçan dogry wagt ýaly däldi.
He complied.	Ol muňa boýun boldy.
I can do that, no problem	Muny edip bilerin, mesele ýok
I think it's the same thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, edil şol bir zat ýaly.
I only have this	Mende diňe şu bar
It's good, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Gowy "-diýdi.
I can't think of that	Men beýle pikir edip bilemok
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
It was nothing.	Ol hiç zat däldi.
I thought it was someone else.	Başga biri diýip pikir etdim.
This is something else	Bu başga zat
What? 	Näme?
he said.	ol aýtdy.
No one could see anything.	Hiç kim hiç zady görüp bilmedi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
She is very smart.	Ol gaty akylly.
This is not life.	Bu durmuş däl.
I am one thing, nothing else.	Men bir zat, başga zat ýok.
To enjoy	Lezzet bermek.
I'll do the first thing in the morning	Irden ilkinji zady ederin
Everything is right	Hemme zat dogry
I think they are great too	Meniň pikirimçe, olar hem ajaýyp
Good idea, man.	Gowy pikir, adam.
I can't take it anymore	Men indi alyp bilemok
I disagree and disagree.	Men muňa razy däl we razy däl.
She didn't seem to care.	Oňa alada ýok ýalydy.
He doesn't think about anything else.	Başga hiç zat hakda pikir etmeýär.
I haven't done anything for a long time	Köp wagt bäri hiç zat etmedim
He didn't stop thinking about the man.	Ol adam hakda pikir etmegini bes etmedi.
I was really.	Men hakykatdanam boldum.
A little	Biraz.
I have to help with that	Men muňa kömek etmeli
Not much.	Kän däl.
Because, you know, that's what he did to me.	Sebäbi, bilýärsiň, bu onuň maňa eden zady.
They need to be there.	Olar zerur we şol ýerde bolmaly.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ol indi alyp bilmedi.
Today was a great day	Bu gün gaty uly gün boldy
Of course it is impossible to know this.	Elbetde muny bilmek mümkin däl.
I will never be	Men asla bolmaz
I only do this with you	Men muny diňe seniň bilen edýärin
I didn't have to do much	Kän etmeli däldim
Always there.	Elmydama şol ýerde.
I didn’t think it was possible	Mümkin diýip pikir etmedim
This is not smart.	Bu akylly däl.
I didn't think otherwise	Başga pikir etmedim
I want the next one.	Indiki isleýärin.
That's all.	Bu hemme zat.
I want to be as close as we can	Biz ýaly ýakyn bolmak isleýärin
Here they are.	Ine, olar şol ýerde.
I know there is something	Bir zadyň bardygyny bilýärin
I hope it helps.	Kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
I never thought otherwise.	Men hiç haçan başga pikir etmedim.
I think a lot of people do that	Meniň pikirimçe, köp adam şeýle edýär
Then things started to go awry.	Soň geň zatlar bolup başlady.
For this and that alone.	Munuň üçin we diňe şu.
I know it's not easy for you	Siziň üçin aňsat däldigini bilýärin
There would really be only one person.	Hakykatdanam, diňe bir adam bolardy.
I can't tell you anymore	Indi saňa aýdyp biljek däl
Of course it will.	Elbetde geler.
What it looks like now.	Häzirki wagtda nähili görünýär.
The hardest thing.	Iň kyn zat.
I thought about me.	Men hakda pikir etdim.
Something interesting about that.	Bu hakda gyzykly zat.
You and I.	Sen we ikimiz.
Everything.	Hemme zat.
It will take money.	Munuň üçin pul gerek bolar.
You will be happy.	Siz bagtly bolarsyňyz.
No worries here.	Bu ýerde alada bolmaz.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň sebäbi şeýle boldy.
I have another problem.	Mende başga bir mesele bar.
It was not the next or the next.	Indiki ýa-da indiki zat däldi.
I can't say what he did with it	Munuň bilen näme edenini aýdyp bilemok
I didn't want to be there	Men ol ýerde bolmak islemedim
I could not be happier	Men beýle bagtly bolup bilmedim
I think this is something more serious	Bu has çynlakaý bir zat diýip pikir edýärin
No no	Ýok Ýok.
It can even be fun.	Hatda gyzykly bolup biler.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu şeýle.
It's really early	Hakykatdanam gaty öň
I had nothing.	Mende hiç zat ýokdy.
I think it's really beautiful	Meniň pikirimçe, hakykatdanam owadan
I did bad things.	Men erbet zatlar etdim.
I had no such thing	Mende beýle zat ýokdy
I am not alone	Men ýeke däl
Of course.	Elbetde.
I didn’t want to take it until then	Men oňa çenli almak islemedim
I was so bad to you	Men saňa gaty erbet boldum
He did.	Ol şeýle etdi.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I could do nothing	Men hiç zat edip bilmedim
Maybe he didn't either.	Belki, ol hem etmedi.
He is like you.	Ol seniň ýaly.
I couldn't see you like that	Men seni beýle görüp bilmedim
I will be with you	Men seniň bilen bolaryn
It's not about anything.	Bu bir zat hakda däl.
Not about a guy.	Bir ýigit hakda däl.
Whatever he wanted to do, it would be nice.	Oňa näme etjek bolsa, gowy bolardy.
I will need it.	Men muny zerur ederin.
I can do that, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Muny edip bilerin "-diýdi.
So it's bigger.	Şonuň üçin bu has uly.
There was everything there.	Ol ýerde bar zat bardy.
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolardy.
Maybe never.	Belki hiç haçan bolmaz.
I don't want help	Kömek islämok
I didn't have a chance	Mende mümkinçilik ýokdy
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He did not ask any questions.	Ol hiç hili sorag bermedi.
I thought it was good.	Gowy diýip pikir etdim.
He just said he wanted to see us right away.	Diňe bizi derrew görmek isleýändigini aýtdy.
That must be a good thing.	Bu gowy zat bolmaly.
I thought about it a lot.	Men bu hakda gaty pikir etdim.
I just know it happened	Munuň bolandygyny diňe bilýärin
I can do it again.	Men ýene edip bilerin.
You can get it.	Siz alyp bilersiňiz.
With	Bilen.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I must have done something.	Men bir zat eden bolmaly.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I didn’t think it existed anymore	Indi bar diýip pikir etmedim
Not good, not bad.	Gowy däl, erbet däl.
I can't be like that	Men beýle bolup bilemok
To do this.	Muny etmek üçin.
That's right.	Dogry.
And then? 	Soň bolsa?
he thought.	diýip pikir etdi.
I know he cares about you a lot	Onuň saňa gaty alada edýändigini bilýärin
A little weird, but good	Biraz geň, ýöne gowy
I didn't think he could do that	Muny edip biler öýdemokdym
I didn't know anything	Men hiç zady bilmeýärdim
I haven't seen him in months	Men ony birnäçe aý bäri görmedim
I can't be	Men bolup bilemok
You are not stupid	Sen samsyk däl.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Muny diňe bir gezek etmeli bolarsyňyz.
Of course not.	Elbetde ýok.
I saw him three days ago	Men ony üç gün ozal gördüm
This was not possible for him.	Bu onuň üçin mümkin däldi.
I don't think that's right.	Bu dogry däl öýdemok.
They weren't that bad.	Olar beýle erbet däldi.
This is the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek boldy.
I haven't seen it yet	Munuň henizem bardygyny görmedim
I am now alone	Men indi ýeke özüm boldum
Good fun stuff.	Gowy gyzykly zatlar.
He asked for help.	Ol özüne kömek sorady.
He was not ready for it.	Ol muňa asla taýyn däldi.
Of course, I would like to know more about this	Elbetde, bu hakda has köp bilmek isleýärin
You have to go. "	Sen gitmeli "diýdi.
So weird.	Şonuň üçin geň.
I'm here for you.	Men seniň üçin bu ýerde.
I didn't do anything good here.	Bu ýerde hiç hili gowy iş etmedim.
I can't tell her the truth	Men oňa hakykaty aýdyp biljek däl
I still don't know what he wants from me	Onuň menden näme isleýändigini henizem bilmedim
I thought it was really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy diýip pikir etdim.
A few meals.	Birnäçe nahar.
An idea came to him	Oňa bir pikir geldi
Ma'am.	Bu.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
You don't have to do that.	Şeýle etmeli däl.
It seems very difficult to say more.	Has köp zady aýtmak gaty kyn ýaly.
I hope it is there.	Ol ýerde bar diýip umyt edýärin.
Because, of course, no one could do that.	Sebäbi, elbetde, hiç kim muny edip bilmedi.
I have another suggestion	Mende başga bir teklip bar
Okay.	Bolýar.
This is not very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn däl.
Because he said he would.	Sebäbi etjekdigini aýtdy.
I think that's what happened here	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýerde şeýle boldy
Couldn't hurt.	Zyýan berip bilmedi.
Sorry, but no.	Bagyşlaň, ýöne ýok.
I believe and that is enough	Men ynanýaryn we bu ýeterlik
Maybe not very good.	Belki gaty gowy däl.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people	Diňe seni etmeli
I have to go home now	Men indi öýe gitmeli
I also want to help	Şeýle hem kömek etmek isleýärin
That seemed right.	Bu dogry ýalydy.
Just a matter of time.	Diňe bir mesele.
I did this several times, and no one helped	Muny birnäçe gezek etdim, hiç kim kömek etmedi
I'm not that stupid.	Men beýle samsyk däl.
Man, but more.	Adam, ýöne has köp.
I didn't know anything	Men hiç zady bilmeýärdim
They are crazy.	Olar däli.
I thought it was a good thing	Bu gaty gowy zat diýip pikir etdim
I have never seen anything like it	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim
It should not be harmed.	Oňa zyýan bermeli däl.
I admire that.	Men muňa haýran.
Whatever you need.	Size näme gerek bolsa.
There was no chance.	Hiç hili mümkinçilik ýokdy.
I have to go so far	Men beýle uzak gitmeli
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
Just as easy.	Edil şonuň ýaly aňsat.
I didn't want that.	Men muny islemedim.
I hoped it would.	Bolar diýip umyt etdim.
I never knew.	Men hiç haçan bilmedim.
I thought it was great	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim
He says.	Ol aýdýar .
He helped me.	Ol maňa kömek etdi.
That's the way it is.	Şonuň ýaly.
He thought he must be crazy.	Ol däli bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
This is not a big deal.	Bu uly mesele däl.
It comes from you.	Bu senden gelýär.
I just want to be with you tonight	Diňe şu gije siziň bilen bolmak isleýärin
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
I had something to do	Meniň etmeli zadym bardy
This is not necessarily a bad thing.	Bu hökman erbet zat däl.
These are interesting things.	Bu gyzykly zatlar.
No one said that.	Muny hiç kim aýtmady.
This seems to be true.	Bu dogry bolup görünýär.
I know better than to do that.	Muny etmekden has gowy bilýärin.
This is not easy for him.	Bu onuň üçin aňsat däl.
I know better	Men has gowy bilýärin
I couldn't do anything else	Başga zat edip bilmedim
We are not really like that.	Biz hakykatdanam beýle däl.
I did the right thing.	Dogry bir zat etdim.
Not a good day for me.	Meniň üçin gowy gün däl.
I think it's good.	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
I never saw it.	Men muny hiç haçan görmedim.
In fact.	Aslynda.
Okay, here it is.	Bolýar, ine şu.
This is very crazy.	Bu gaty däli.
I do this.	Men bu işi edýärin.
Of course there was.	Elbetde bardy.
There is no one here but me.	Bu ýerde menden başga hiç kim ýok.
It was good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy boldy.
I am three years old	Men üç ýaş uly
He was here, there, everywhere.	Ol şu ýerde, ol ýerde, hemme ýerde bardy.
I didn't think much	Men kän pikir etmedim
You don't have to go together.	Bile gitmeli däl.
He came out immediately	Ol derrew çykdy
He is not.	Ol beýle däl.
I won’t be much here	Men bu ýerde has köp bolmaz
I could do nothing	Men hiç zat edip bilmedim
I didn't see much at the time.	Men şol wagt gaty görmedim.
Not even that hard.	Hatda beýle kyn däl.
I said everything.	Men hemme zady aýtdym.
It will.	Bu eder.
I think so	Meniň pikirimçe, şeýle boldy
I've always been like that.	Men elmydama şeýle boldum.
I think so	Men bu hakda şeýle pikir edýärin
No one knows much about them.	Hiç kim olar hakda köp zat bilmeýär.
He does this a lot.	Muny köp edýär.
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele.
There, right there.	Ol ýerde, edil şol ýerde.
I don't know how that happened	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilemok
I know it will happen.	Boljakdygyny bilýärin.
I thought no one could be there	Ol ýerde hiç kim bolup bilmez diýip pikir etdim
It wasn't bad.	Erbet däldi.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, muňa garşy bolmaz.
Next year will be a bright year for him.	Geljek ýyl hem onuň üçin aýdyň ýyl bolar.
Not there.	Ol ýerde ýok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň ýaly iş.
She was worried.	Ony biynjalyk etdi.
It would be easier.	Bu has aňsat bolardy.
This is for us too.	Bu hem biziň üçin.
He understood that.	Ol muňa düşündi.
Of course not.	Elbetde bolmaz.
It's been a year	Bir ýyl uzak boldy
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there	Mende diňe şeýle bolýar
Last year was great.	Geçen ýyl ajaýyp boldy.
I saw it a few weeks ago	Men ony birnäçe hepde öň gördüm
I saw what he did to you.	Men saňa näme edenini gördüm.
I need time alone	Maňa ýeke özüm wagt gerek
OK, a lot.	Bolýar, köp.
He thought about it.	Ol muny pikir etdi.
I just want to go	Men diňe gitmek isleýärin
This will happen soon.	Bu ýakyn wagtda bolar.
I think there are two reasons for this	Munuň iki sebäbi bar diýip pikir edýärin
Of course, I was not a good person	Elbetde, gowy adam däldim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Aslynda bu hakda.
You are still very young.	Sen entek gaty ýaş.
I could have gotten there faster	Men ol ýere has çalt baryp bilýärdim
And a little bit about them.	We olar hakda biraz.
He wanted her to have fun today.	Ol şu gün onuň hezil etmegini isledi.
I was there.	Men ol ýerde boldum.
He said he was right, you know.	Ol aýtdy, dogry aýdýar, bilýärsiň.
A man came out.	Bir adam çykdy.
Neither way can.	Iki ýol hem bolup bilmez.
There is no book here	Bu ýerde kitap ýok
This is one way or another.	Bu bir ýa-da başga.
I couldn't decide.	Men karar berip bilmedim.
I think it should be great	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gaty gowy bolmaly
I don't need anything.	Maňa hiç zat gerek däl.
I will not be like that	Mende beýle bolmaz
Maybe you should go home	Belki, öýe gitmeli
He gave it to me.	Ol maňa berdi.
No one had to tell me that.	Muny maňa hiç kim aýtmaly däldi.
So I have to say that.	Şonuň üçin muny aýtmaly.
He did not tell me when or where he would be.	Ol maňa haçan, haçan boljakdygyny aýtmady.
It took time.	Bu wagt aldy.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
An idea came to him	Oňa bir pikir geldi
I knew he didn't want to be there	Men onuň ol ýerde bolmak islemeýändigini bilýärdim
I never thought of it that way	Men bu hakda asla beýle pikir etmedim
I thought everything was fine.	Hemme zat diýip pikir etdim.
I have to go	Men gitmeli
You can call us.	Bize jaň edip bilersiňiz.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim
Many times	Köp gezek.
No money, no good life.	Pul ýok, gowy durmuş ýok.
Just one.	Diňe bir.
You didn't have to know that.	Muny bilmek hökman däldi.
That can't be too bad, can it?	Bu gaty erbet bolup bilmez, şeýlemi?
I recommended this.	Men muny maslahat berdim.
Now many people know.	Indi köp adam bilýär.
It seemed so good.	Bu gaty gowy ýalydy.
I think it could be.	Belki bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
I haven't seen it before	Men ozal görmedim
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
I think someone said something to me.	Kimdir biri maňa bir zat aýtdy öýdýän.
I could not be happier	Men beýle bagtly bolup bilmedim
I can sleep.	Men uklap bilerin.
I didn't really think about it	Aslynda bu hakda pikir etmedim
It took me a year to do that.	Muny etmek üçin maňa bir ýyl gerek boldy.
There is money.	Pul bar.
It takes a little help.	Munuň üçin biraz kömek gerek.
You know it will always be.	Munuň hemişe boljakdygyny bilýärsiň.
This is not really difficult.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn däl.
I didn’t want to do any of that	Men munuň hiç birini etmek islemedim
Now no one can tell me anything.	Indi hiç kim maňa hiç zat aýdyp bilmez.
I don't want to go there again	Men ýene ol ýere gitmek islämok
I always have	Mende hemişe bar.
He took us all day.	Bizi bütin gün alyp gitdi.
I gave him time	Men oňa wagt berdim
He said a hundred times that he did not mind.	Oňa garşy däldigini ýüz gezek aýtdy.
That's the way it is.	Ine, şonuň ýaly.
It was great today.	Bu gün ajaýyp boldy.
I thought they were gone	Olar gitdi öýdüpdim
I have been there several times	Men ol ýerde birnäçe gezek boldum
I need it now	Maňa indi gaty gerek
I thought about telling you every day	Men saňa her gün aýtmak hakda pikir etdim
I have done this many times.	Men muny köp gezek etdim.
I could no longer go to work or school	Indi işe ýa-da mekdebe gidip bilmedim
I think that's why we are	Meniň pikirimçe, munuň sebäbi biz
Now they are.	Indi olar.
Difficult question.	Kyn sorag.
I don't think he's anywhere.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol bir ýerde däl.
Oh, that's bad.	Aý, bu erbet.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
The reason for this must be clear	Munuň sebäbi aýdyň bolmaly
No more.	Indi ýok.
You have to tell him not to.	Oňa beýle etmezligi aýtmaly.
You don't have to worry about anything.	Hiç zat hakda alada etmek hökman däl.
I think it would be good	Gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I can't say how it will be	Munuň nähili boljakdygyny aýdyp biljek däl
I should never have done that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmeli däldim.
The first two are songs and lyrics	Ilkinji ikisi aýdym we söz
I had to advise	Men maslahat bermeli boldum
I heard what happened	Näme bolandygyny eşitdim
Everything will be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolar.
I do better.	Men has gowy edýärin.
I wonder how long this will last	Munuň näçe wagt boljakdygyna haýran
I want it all.	Hemmesini isleýärin.
That's all there is to it.	Bu hakda diňe bir zat.
I don't have to help you	Men size kömek etmeli däl
There may be two messages.	Iki habar bolmagy ähtimal.
In fact, it was not a single word.	Aslynda bu ýekeje söz däldi.
Next week.	Indiki hepde.
I need help, please.	Maňa kömek gerek, haýyş.
I think there is someone for everyone	Meniň pikirimçe, hemmeler üçin kimdir biri bar
I don't need you	Sen maňa gerek däl
This is still true.	Bu henizem dogry.
We are.	Biz.
He took one.	Birini aldy.
I couldn't do anything else	Başga zat edip bilmedim
That's it.	Biz şol.
They were not and are not.	Olar beýle däldi we häzir ýok.
Many people went there	Ol ýere köp adam gitdi
I got it	Men aldym
In fact, we can't.	Aslynda edip bilmeris.
Only a few.	Diňe birnäçe.
No more work.	Indi iş ýok.
He will take care of it.	Ol muňa alada eder.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
There are two ways to do this.	Bu hakda iki ýol ýok.
This is often the case.	Köplenç şeýle bolýar.
He wants more.	Ol has köp zat isleýär.
A lot of time.	Wagt köp.
They have.	Olar bar.
This is very modern.	Bu gaty häzirki.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
I doubt this will happen	Munuň boljakdygyna şübhelenýärin
This does not seem to be the case	Bu beýle däl ýaly
I think this is a very difficult issue for us.	Bu biziň üçin gaty kyn mesele diýip pikir edýärin.
I never wanted to hurt you	Men hiç haçan size zyýan bermek islemedim
I'm sure he'll do well.	Gowy etjekdigine ynanýaryn.
If there is no better way, he will.	Has gowy ýol ýok bolsa, eder.
He hurt you.	Ol size zyýan berdi.
I have already done this for myself	Men muny eýýäm özüm üçin etdim
This is not a big deal.	Bu uly mesele däl.
I thought he was worried about me	Ol meniň hakda alada edýär öýdüpdim
I want to see you here.	Men sizi bu ýerde görmek isleýärin.
He is serious.	Ol çynlakaý.
I'm not that happy.	Men beýle bagtly däl.
I still want it	Men henizem ony isleýärin
I still said it very well.	Men henizem gaty gowy aýtdym.
He did something.	Ol bir zatlar etdi.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
It all started with him.	Bu oňa başlady.
He was never disturbed.	Ony hiç wagt biynjalyk etmedi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu ýerde gowy zat.
He immediately agreed.	Ol derrew razy boldy.
This is unlikely.	Bu ähtimal däl.
I couldn't see how he could do it	Onuň nädip edip biljekdigini görüp bilmedim
I know it's not fun	Munuň gyzykly däldigini bilýärin
So you have to do something about it.	Şonuň üçin bu hakda bir zat etmeli.
In fact.	Aslynda.
Someone who knew he was there took it.	Ol ýerde bardygyny bilýän biri aldy.
This should not be easy.	Muny etmek aňsat däl bolmaly.
He knew he was there.	Ol bardygyny bilýärdi.
Never will, never will.	Hiç haçan bolmaz, bolmaz.
That's it.	Ol hem şol.
I know one thing	Men bir zady bilýärin
I think it's very beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan diýip pikir edýärin.
I couldn't do that to him	Men oňa muny edip bilmedim
They are completely different.	Olar düýbünden başga.
I'm talking about you	Men sen hakda
I think that's a good thing	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy zat
It's hard for me to say that	Maňa muny aýtmak kyn
I don't need that	Maňa beýle gerek bolmaz
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
I know this can't be easy	Munuň aňsat bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärin
I have tried many things	Men köp zady synap gördüm
I know it will be good.	Gowy boljakdygyny bilýärin.
That was not the case with me.	Bu meniň bilen beýle däldi.
They are.	Olar.
I almost	Men diýen ýaly
I want to help you	Size kömek etmek isleýärin
He was not big to me.	Ol meniň üçin uly däldi.
Sorry, I can't even say that.	Bagyşlaň, hatda muny aýdyp bilenok.
Now I hope it helps.	Indi maňa kömek eder diýip umyt etdim.
He said he would help me.	Maňa kömek etjekdigini aýtdy.
Not today.	Bu gün däl.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýok.
It will not be easy for you.	Bu siziň üçin aňsat bolmaz.
I was home alone all night	Men bütin gije öýde ýeke boldum
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
I have never seen anything like it.	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim.
Nothing else is needed.	Başga hiç zat gerek däl.
Even then.	Şol wagt hem.
Just for him.	Diňe onuň üçin.
I am always alone, really alone	Men elmydama ýeke, hakykatdanam ýeke
I want to offer you	Size teklip bermek isleýärin
There was a lot of work.	Iş köp boldy.
I didn't call you.	Men saňa jaň etmedim.
I could be crazy.	Men däli bolup bilerin.
This is the case now.	Bu indi şeýle.
I didn't call	Meniň jaň etmedim
Maybe it's nothing.	Belki bu hiç zat däl.
Good.	Gowy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Diňe şeýle bolmaly.
Not for you	Seniň üçin däl
I want to be there for you.	Men siziň üçin şol ýerde bolmak isleýärin.
And then there are always the ones with him.	Soň bolsa hemişe onuň bilen bile bolýar.
I would like to make a request	Men haýyş etmek isleýärin
Lots and lots of books.	Köp we köp kitap.
He asked for help.	Ol kömek sorady.
Not much.	Kän däldi.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
I didn't know why he did that	Näme üçin beýle edendigini bilmedim
I don't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmeýärin.
You are everything.	Sen hemme zat.
All the time	Bütin wagt.
I am not.	Men däl.
He had no hope.	Oňa umyt ýokdy.
That sounds kind of interesting to me.	Bu meniň üçin bir hili gyzykly ýaly.
You have to help him.	Oňa kömek etmeli.
I'm not good at that.	Men munuň bilen gowy däl.
I didn't think much of it	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmedim
They really did exist.	Olar hakykatdanam bardy.
Without you	Sen sen
Not enough time.	Wagt ýeterlik däldi.
It's not just me.	Bu diňe men däl.
I've always been here	Men hemişe şu ýerde boldum
I can't think of anything else	Başga hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilemok
He was not happy.	Ol bagtly däldi.
I think he wants to talk to you	Meniň pikirimçe, ol siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýär
I haven't been there in a long time	Köp wagt bäri ol ýerde däldim
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
I shouldn’t have hurt him	Men oňa zyýan bermeli däldim
I got another message	Başga bir habar aldym
There is no time for that.	Munuň üçin wagt ýok.
He would be there tomorrow morning.	Ertir irden ol ýerde bolardy.
I don't have to worry about that.	Men bu barada alada etmeli däl.
I want to do these things	Men bu zatlary etmek isleýärin
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
I am the best guy	Men iň gowy ýigit
You don't have to do much.	Köp etmeli däl.
They are very good.	Olar gaty gowy.
I wasn't going to do that	Men muny etjek däldim
Nothing was too difficult for them	Hiç zat olar üçin gaty kyn däldi
I can't have that.	Mende beýle zat bolup bilmez.
I can't help you there	Men ol ýerde size kömek edip bilemok
There was a problem.	Bir mesele bardy.
It was a great day.	Bu ajaýyp gün boldy.
I think it can do a great job	Bu gaty gowy zat edip biler diýip pikir edýärin
Not a bit.	Biraz däl.
I think this will be a great thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
Every year I think of you now	Her ýyl şu wagt sen hakda pikir edýärin
The answer is money.	Jogap pul.
We are two people.	Biz iki adam.
I haven't tried it yet, but I want it soon	Men entek synap görmedim, ýöne ýakyn wagtda isleýärin
He didn't need anything.	Oňa hiç zat gerek däldi.
This will not be a problem.	Bu hiç hili mesele bolmaz.
This is what happens.	Bu şeýle bolýar.
There are still a few months left	Entek ýene birnäçe aý bar
I can't take it anymore	Men indi alyp bilemok
It would be fun tonight.	Bu agşam gyzykly bolardy.
You are very close to that.	Siz muňa gaty ýakyn.
I want to do that.	Muny etmek isleýärin.
I don't think he will do it tonight.	Ony şu gije eder öýdemok.
Maybe something new every week.	Belki her hepde täze bir zat.
This made him anxious.	Bu bolsa ony biynjalyk etdi.
That working day.	Şol iş güni.
I didn't do enough for them	Men olar üçin ýeterlik zat etmedim
I didn't love myself that much	Özümi beýle gowy görmedim
And then he left.	Soň bolsa ol gitdi.
It was good for the first time.	Ilkinji gezek gowy boldy.
We can't do that.	Biz muny edip bilmeris.
The question is how to do it.	Sorag muny nädip etmeli.
There is a reason for this.	Munuň bir sebäbi bar.
Knowing this is not his job.	Muny bilmek onuň işi däl.
I will help him.	Men oňa kömek ederin.
Because it is different	Sebäbi başga
That says a lot.	Bu köp zady aýdýar.
I just need time	Maňa diňe wagt gerek
There is no answer at all.	Asla jogap ýok.
He did not want to talk to anyone at the moment.	Ol şu wagt hiç kim bilen gürleşmek islemedi.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
I didn't need any books to say that.	Maňa muny aýtmak üçin hiç hili kitap gerek däldi.
You know that's not the case.	Munuň beýle däldigini bilýärsiň.
It didn’t seem to be against it.	Muňa garşy däl ýalydy.
Work, work, work.	Iş, iş, iş.
I was crazy.	Men däli boldum.
I should have known better	Men has gowy bilýän bolmaly
I hoped everything would be fine	Hemme zat gowy bolar diýip umyt etdim
I couldn't sleep	Men uklap bilmedim
I haven't seen it yet	Men entek görmedim
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I have to	Men etmeli
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
That's great.	Bu ajaýyp zat.
I had to stop it now	Men muny indi bes etmeli boldum
One week is enough	Bir hepde ýeterlik
I didn't have one before	Mende öňem ýokdy
I'm fine with that	Men munuň bilen gowy boldum
Oh, that must be very difficult for them.	Aý, bu olar üçin gaty kyn bolmaly.
Once or twice, maybe more.	Bir ýa-da iki gezek, belki has köp.
Definitely interesting.	Elbetde gyzykly.
He knew more.	Ol has köp zady bilýärdi.
To know what to do.	Näme etmelidigini bilmek üçin.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
I have to do that now	Men muny indi etmeli
Of course together.	Elbetde bilelikde bilelikde.
In fact, there are many.	Aslynda gaty köp.
It was fun.	Bu hezil boldy.
I saw him there.	Ony şol ýerde gördüm.
I already know what happened	Näme bolandygyny eýýäm bilýärin
It takes time for these things.	Bu zatlar üçin wagt gerek.
It was such a strange sound.	Şeýle geň ses boldy.
I really believe that.	Men muňa hakykatdanam ynanýaryn.
If you need more, please let us know.	Has köp zat gerek bolsa, bize aýdyň.
Only this morning	Diňe şu gün irden.
Maybe it would be better for us.	Belki, bu biziň üçin gowy bolardy.
He knows this well.	Ol muny gowy bilýär.
Everyone is doing something great.	Her kim muny uly bir zat edýär.
I thought everyone would be happy	Hemmeler bagtly bolar öýdüpdim
I thought of it another way.	Munuň üçin başga ýol bilen pikir etdim.
Not two.	Iki däl.
He wanted to.	Ol isledi.
I never did.	Hiç wagt wagt etmedim.
She is beautiful.	Ol owadan.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
I haven't seen it yet	Men ony entek görüp bilmedim
I agree, very strange	Men razy, gaty geň
What happened?	Bu näme boldy.
He can help me.	Ol maňa kömek edip biler.
He reported the matter to police.	Ol polisiýa habar berdi.
It was not happy.	Bu bagtly däldi.
This could also be a mistake.	Bu hem ýalňyşlyk bolup biler.
You can answer, or not.	Jogap berip bilersiňiz, ýa-da ýok.
We are human.	Biz adam.
I'm not with them anymore	Men indi olar bilen däl
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
I can't buy it	Men muny satyn alyp bilemok
I did.	Men etdim.
I never wanted to hurt you	Men hiç haçan size zyýan bermek islemedim
A little stupid.	Biraz samsyk.
I heard something	Men bir zat eşitdim
There was no sound.	Ses ýokdy.
It wasn't three yet.	Entek üç däldi.
There is only one.	Diňe biri bar.
I know what he's thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilýärin
Only once.	Diňe bir gezek.
So I don't owe you anything.	Şonuň üçin maňa karz ýok.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
Not such a good idea.	Beýle gowy pikir däl.
I am good for other things	Men başga zatlar üçin gowy
He still couldn't sleep well.	Ol henizem gowy uklap bilmedi.
I can't say enough	Muny ýeterlik diýip biljek däl
I think you can see what he can do.	Onuň edip biljek zadyny görüp bilersiňiz diýip pikir edýärin.
I already have	Mende eýýäm bar
I must have a reason.	Mende bir sebäp bolmaly.
Not for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin däl.
I couldn't tell you that.	Men saňa muny aýdyp bilmedim.
I didn't know much about him	Men ol hakda kän bilmeýärdim
I can't worry about that right now	Men häzir bu barada alada edip bilemok
Of course he will think so.	Elbetde, beýle pikir eder.
He was there, but he could not see it.	Ol ýerde bardy, ýöne ony görüp bilmedi.
I have to pay attention to that	Men muňa üns bermeli
I can try another one	Başga birini synap görüp bilerin
This is not us.	Bu biz däl.
It was now.	Indi bardy.
I gave it my all	Men oňa hemmesini berdim
Now you can.	Indi edip bilersiňiz.
Police wanted to call.	Polisiýa jaň etmek isledi.
I think the money is good	Pul gowy diýip pikir edýärin
Several times.	Birnäçe gezek.
I hope it's not just for me.	Diňe meniň üçin däl diýip umyt edýärin.
I tried it everywhere	Men hemme ýerde synap gördüm
I can't do that	Men beýle zat edip bilemok
There are more opportunities.	Has köp mümkinçilik bar.
He said he would take care of it immediately.	Derrew alada etjekdigini aýtdy.
I know he wants to tell you	Bilýärin, saňa özi aýtmak isleýär
What a way.	Nähili ýol.
He could not say anything else.	Başga bir zady aýdyp bilmedi.
I called him and he didn't answer	Men oňa jaň etdim, ol jogap bermedi
This and that.	Bu we başga.
There is no answer to this at this time.	Häzirki wagtda muňa jogap ýok.
I hope he didn't	Ol muny etmedi diýip umyt edýärin
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
To be so.	Şeýle bolmak.
I didn't do that	Men ol zatlary etmedim
Still have to do it here.	Entek şu ýerde etmeli.
I hope it helps.	Size kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
With this thought came another thought.	Bu pikir bilen başga bir pikir geldi.
I know.	Men bilerin.
I gave it to him	Men ony oňa berdim
I did not object	Men muňa garşy däldim
I don't want that anymore	Indi muny islämok
No one could do that.	Hiç kim muny edip bilmedi.
This is a must.	Bu hökman.
This is great for you.	Bu siziň üçin ajaýyp.
It was like a good day.	Gowy gün ýalydy.

I don’t seem to be helping him	Men oňa kömek etjek ýaly däl
I'm everywhere, but nowhere	Men hemme ýerde, ýöne hiç ýerde
I hope so.	Şeýle eder diýip umyt edýärin.
The question is why?	Sorag näme üçin?
I can say that about myself	Muny özüm hakda aýdyp bilerin
I haven't seen it so interesting in a long time	Köp wagt bäri beýle gyzykly görmedim
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle zat däl.
I couldn't see it anywhere	Men ony hiç ýerde görüp bilmedim
I still feel sorry for him.	Men oňa henizem gynanýaryn.
Just to try.	Diňe synap görmek üçin.
I want to do that	Men muny etmek isleýärin
He had to do that.	Muny etmeli boldy.
New things are possible.	Täze zatlar mümkin bolýar.
I think that's enough	Bu ýeterlik diýip pikir edýärin
This is a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý mesele.
He asked about you.	Ol sen hakda sorady.
The biggest problem is.	Iň uly mesele bar.
Nothing can happen.	Hiç zat bolup bilmez.
I think it's good	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin
We need it now	Bize indi gerek
I want to be somewhere else.	Başga bir ýerde, başga bir ýerde bolmak isleýärin.
Wants to go with you	Seniň bilen gitmek isleýär.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.

There was something.	Bir zat bardy.
I will destroy you	Men seni ýok etjek men

I think it was good	Bu gowy boldy diýip pikir edýärin
You need this advice.	Size bu maslahat gerek.
Only the Sun can do that.	Muny diňe Gün edip biler.
It was new.	Bu täze boldy.
You need	Size gerek.
This idea is different.	Bu pikir başga.
Everyone is coming.	Hemmeler gelýär.
I thought it was the best thing	Iň ajaýyp zat diýip pikir etdim
This is a question of when and not.	Bu haçan we ýok diýen sorag.

I have repeatedly told him not to think so	Men oňa beýle pikir etmezligi birnäçe gezek aýtdym
I think that's a good idea	Bu gaty gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin
I'm having fun!	Men hezil edýärin!
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele.
It can't be.	Bolup bilmez.
I thought it was good	Gowy diýip pikir etdim
Not really.	Hakykatdanam beýle däl.
I shouldn't have done that	Men beýle etmeli däldim
Not much yet.	Entek kän däl.
There is a reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi hem bar.
It sounded really good.	Çynlakaý gaty gowy ses çykdy.
It was very possible.	Bu gaty mümkin boldy.
He did not want it for himself or for them.	Muny özi ýa-da olar üçin islemedi.
He is no longer with us.	Ol indi biziň bilen däl.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
I'm more interested.	Men has gyzykly.
It's too fast.	Bu gaty çalt.
There are two issues with this.	Munuň bilen iki mesele bar.
I've never thought of that before	Men ozal hiç kim hakda beýle pikir etmedim
I'm fine today	Men şu gün gaty gowy
I was not really there	Men hakykatdanam ol ýerde däldim
I have seen this many times.	Men muny köp gezek gördüm.

Many people came.	Köp adam geldi.

At that time and there.	Şol wagt we ol ýerde.
I'm not good enough	Men ýeterlik däl
Then he was really surprised.	Soň hakykatdanam geň galdy.
The man was very upset.	Ol adam gaty biynjalyk boldy.
So that everything will be easy.	Hemme zat aňsat bolar ýaly.
We can do that.	Muny edip bileris.

He couldn't get much.	Ol kän bir zat alyp bilmedi.
I need money	Maňa pul gerek
A word for everything	Hemme zat üçin söz
And then he can do something about it.	Soň bolsa bu hakda bir zat edip biler.
I couldn't take a long break.	Uzak dynç alyp bilmedim.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
I can't see you anymore	Men seni indi görüp bilemok
It would be great.	Ajaýyp bolardy.
I never wanted to hurt you	Men hiç haçan saňa zyýan bermek islemedim

You have to be clear about that.	Bu barada aýdyň bolmaly.
You really are.	Siz hakykatdanam şeýle.
I can't speak right away	Men derrew gürläp bilemok
I just thought it might be good	Diňe gowy bolup biler öýdüpdim
I knew he wouldn't help me	Onuň maňa kömek etmejekdigini bilýärdim
This is both good and bad.	Bu hem gowy, hem erbet.
It's easy for you.	Bu siziň üçin aňsat.
He can tell you things.	Ol size zatlary aýdyp biler.
A little weird, but good.	Biraz geň, ýöne gowy.
I could see it now	Men muny indi görüp bilýärdim

Which is good, because it wasn't.	Haýsy gowy zat, sebäbi beýle däldi.
You are absolutely right.	Siz düýbünden dogry.

I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I hoped it was the same	Öňküsi diýip umyt etdim

Money is probably the biggest.	Pul iň uly bolmagy ähtimal.
It happens a lot.	Bu köp bolýar.
I knew it was there	Men onuň bolandygyny bilýärdim
Not everyone was able to get it	Hemmeler muny alyp bilmedi

This time I was really crazy	Men bu gezek hakykatdanam däli boldum
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
This is his first job.	Bu onuň ilkinji işi.

The next one is worse.	Indiki bolsa has erbet.
I have something to tell you	Men saňa bir zat aýtmaly
I really have to go home	Men hakykatdanam öýe gitmeli

I will have fun with you	Men siziň bilen hezil etjek

That day has come.	Şol gün geldi.

I didn't see that	Men muny görmedim
He did not know what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilmeýärdi.
He got it fast.	Ol çalt aldy.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I couldn't sleep anymore	Indi uklap bilmedim
This was not a new idea.	Bu düýbünden täze pikir däldi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Diňe oňa hiç zat ýok.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.

This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
We can't report it or do anything about it.	Biz bu barada habar berip bilmeris ýa-da bu barada hiç zat edip bilmeris.
It should be short and accurate	Gysga we dogry bolmaly
It's been a while.	Bu birneme wagt boldy.
He is not there yet.	Ol entek ýok.
Someone.	Kimdir biri.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
In fact, he didn't pay attention.	Aslynda, muňa üns bermedi.
How hard it is for you.	Siziň üçin nähili kyn.
There are three reasons for this.	Munuň üç sebäbi bar.
In fact, this is often the case.	Aslynda köplenç şeýle bolýar.
And then there was the surprise.	Soň bolsa iň geň galdy.

I can do beautiful things	Men owadan iş edip bilerin
I had no choice	Mende başga ýol ýokdy
She is very good at it.	Ol bu barada gaty gowy.
He answered.	Ol jogap berdi.
The message was short.	Habar gysga boldy.
You have to do a lot.	Köp zat etmeli.
I have to go to school	Men mekdebe gitmeli
I think that's what he is	Meniň pikirimçe, bu onuň özi
That's what happened.	Ol şeýle boldy.
I thought something had happened.	Bir zat boldy öýdüpdim.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
I had to call you	Men saňa jaň etmeli boldum
I can always go back	Men elmydama gaýdyp bilerin
I agree.	Men razy boldum.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
It's hard to do that.	Muny etmek kyn.
Maybe good, maybe bad.	Belki gowy, belki erbet.
Of course, I was once	Elbetde, men bir gezek boldum
I have a very big problem	Mende gaty uly mesele bar
Of course, he couldn't afford it.	Elbetde, ony satyn alyp bilmedi.
I'm not going to help me on the weekend.	Dynç güni maňa kömek etjek däl.
In fact, there is more.	Aslynda, has köp zat bar.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
That's right.	Dogry.
We can't help it.	Biz oňa kömek edip bilmeris.
I can't get any work done	Men hiç hili iş alyp bilemok
There must be someone else.	Başga biri bolmaly.
I said it would happen	Munuň boljakdygyny aýtdym
Just talk to me.	Diňe meniň bilen aýdyň.
Everything looks so good.	Hemme zat gaty gowy görünýär.
Another voice answered him, then another voice.	Başga bir ses oňa jogap berdi, soň başga ses.
You can sing like that.	Şonuň ýaly aýdym aýdyp bilersiňiz.
It’s not a lot of money, but it really helps a lot.	Bu kän pul däl, ýöne hakykatdanam köp kömek edýär.
It's not easy, it's hard for them.	Bu aňsat däl, olar üçin kyn.
I didn't know it existed	Men onuň bardygyny bilmedim
It seemed good.	Gowy ýalydy.
Now I can say something about you	Häzir sen hakda bir zat aýdyp bilerin
He will do so.	Ol şeýle eder.
He just didn’t pay attention to us.	Ol diňe bize üns bermedi.
The next one is this.	Indiki biri iki.
I did not call and did not visit	Men oňa jaň etmedim we baryp görmedim
I thought he had it.	Men ony bar diýip pikir etdim.
It wasn't me.	Bu men däldi.
This is very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolardy.
It seems to be a problem and it is.	Bu kynçylyk ýaly bolup görünýär we şeýle.
At the same time	Şol bir wagtda.
I tried the next thing	Indiki zady synap gördüm
That's not enough yet.	Bu entek ýeterlik däl.
A lot of noise.	Köp ses.
I can see so many and wonderful things	Men gaty köp we ajaýyp zatlary görüp bilýärin
I think there is enough for today	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gün üçin ýeterlik zat bar
I never think about money	Men hiç wagt pul hakda pikir etmeýärin
Hard for him, but very good for us.	Onuň üçin kyn, ýöne biziň üçin gaty gowy.
I do not have	Mende ýok
I thought it might be hard for you.	Bu size kyn bolup biler diýip pikir etdim.
I didn’t do it there	Men ol ýerde etmedim
It was good for that.	Munuň üçin gowy boldy.
I could do nothing for him anymore	Men onuň üçin indi hiç zat edip bilmedim
We have to go.	Biz gitmeli.
What happened.	Näme boldy.
Only yesterday when he was not there.	Düýn ýok wagty diňe şol ýerde.
I could not see anything	Men hiç zady görüp bilmedim
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
He never said that.	Ol hiç haçan beýle zat aýtmady.
I couldn't, it's the weirdest thing	Edip bilmedim, bu iň geň zat
That's right.	Bu dogry.
Only so.	Diňe şeýle.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
This is us.	Bu biz.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Ine, indi alada.
It would be great to see that.	Muny görmek gaty gowy bolardy.
I know that	Men muny bilýärin
This is also a lie.	Bu hem ýalan.
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
Things were great at the time.	Şol wagt zatlar gaty gowy boldy.
He wants to take me.	Ol meni almak isleýär.
As for the girl, she really was.	Gyz hakda bolsa, ol hakykatdanam bardy.
Someone like me.	Meniň ýaly biri.
I thought something was serious	Çynlakaý bir zat boldy öýdüpdim
I think he knows now	Meniň pikirimçe, ol häzir bilýär
Only you are there.	Diňe sen bar.
Then he decided.	Soň bolsa karar berdi.
I knew it was going to happen someday	Munuň bir gün boljakdygyny bilýärdim
In fact, it has nothing to do with it.	Hakykatdanam, oňa hiç zat ýok.
No one paid attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa üns bermedi.
Now you know.	Indi bilýärsiň.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
He said there was nothing else there.	Ol ol ýerde başga zadyň ýokdugyny aýtdy.
A fool	Bir samsyk.
I am never alone with him	Men onuň bilen hiç wagt ýeke däl
I didn't care much	Men kän alada etmedim
I bought it that day	Men ony şol gün satyn aldym
Everything is fine	Hemme zat ajaýyp
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
There was someone here to help me	Bu ýerde maňa kömek etjek biri bardy
I can only agree.	Men diňe razy bolup bilerin.
I think it will be very difficult.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty kyn bolar.
I saw this last week	Men muny geçen hepde gördüm
Several people return in the evening.	Agşam sagat birnäçe adam gaýdyp gelýär.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I only have one day left	Mende diňe bir gün galdy
I didn’t have to tell him it wasn’t good	Oňa gowy däldigini aýtmaly däldim
Good news for them.	Olar üçin gowy habar.
The best thing about it is.	Bu hakda iň gowy zat.
Then, of course, he was the first to return home.	Soň bolsa, elbetde, ilkinji bolup öýe gaýdyp geldi.
Good question	Gowy sorag
I didn't know anything about you.	Men sen hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
I haven't seen him in months	Men ony birnäçe aý bäri görmedim
We are now one.	Biz indi bir.
To do something	Bir zatlar etmek.
I did something stupid, everyone knows	Samsyk bir zat etdim, hemmeler bilýär
We are.	Biz.
I thought it was summer	Bütin tomus bar diýip pikir etdim
I haven't thought much about it before	Men ozal bu barada kän pikir etmedim
Needless to say.	Muny aýtmak gerek.
He does too.	Ol hem edýär.
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
This is not a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir däl.
What is this mistake?	Bu ýalňyşlyk näme?
The only person I know.	Men bilýän ýekeje adam.
Not necessarily.	Hökman däl.
I don't need it.	Maňa gerek däl.
That was a big deal for me.	Bu meniň üçin uly mesele boldy.
One year.	Bir ýyl.
I don’t even have to tell you that	Muny hatda saňa aýtmaly däl
I need it very badly.	Maňa gaty erbet gerek.
He was not there.	Ol ýerde ýokdy.
Only everything is fine.	Diňe hemme zat gowy.
I am beautiful	Men owadan.
I can't see much	Men bir zady gaty görüp bilemok
I think it was great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy boldy.
I didn't mean to offend you	Men muny aýtmak islemedim
Things like that happen.	Munuň ýaly zatlar bolýar.
I don't want to do that	Men muny etmek islämok
It was as if he was trying to do something else.	Başga bir zat etjek bolýan ýalydy.
Everyone is gone.	Hemmeler gitdi.
I want to be a better person	Men has gowy adam bolmak isleýärin
He didn't think about it.	Ol iş hakda pikir etmedi.
This can take a long time.	Bu köp wagt alyp biler.
You can help me.	Maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz.
I didn't have to say that	Men ol zatlary aýtmaly däldim
Who didn't.	Kim etmedi.
I didn't know enough	Men ýeterlik bilmedim
I want to talk about it	Men bu barada gürleşmek isleýärin
Great guy just to do something for you.	Diňe siziň üçin bir zat etjek ajaýyp ýigit.
That bothered you.	Bu sizi biynjalyk etdi.
He realized this very quickly.	Ol muňa gaty çalt düşündi.
I only have two hundred people	Mende diňe iki ýüz adam bar
I'm at home.	Men öýde.
I thought he liked me	Ol meni halaýar diýip pikir etdim
Here's what happens.	Ine, näme bolýar.
I know everything will be fine	Hemme zadyň gowy boljakdygyny bilýärin
I didn't know that before.	Men ozal bilmedim.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bu hakda başga hiç zat etmeli däl.
This may still be the case.	Bu henizem bolup biler.
He couldn't even help her.	Ol hatda oňa kömek edip bilmedi.
You know, seriously.	Bilýärsiň, çynlakaý.
I seriously doubt it will	Onuň boljakdygyna çynlakaý şübhelenýärin
Better now.	Häzir has gowy.
By doing so.	Muny etmek bilen.
I thought it would be fun.	Bu gyzykly bolar diýip pikir etdim.
I don't want to go	Men gitmek islämok
I did it once.	Bir gezek özümi etdim.
I did it now.	Men indi etdim.
And then two things happen that day.	Soň bolsa, şol gün iki zat bolýar.
A week later another book came out	Bir hepde soň başga bir kitap çykdy
I know what he wants.	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärin.
He went to her and answered.	Oňa baryp, jogap berdi.
We are not ready for that.	Biz muňa taýyn däl.
I still couldn't tell	Men henizem aýdyp bilmedim
Then he could sleep at night.	Soň bolsa gije uklap bilýärdi.
I don't want to talk to you.	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek islämok.
Right now	Ine, şu wagt.
I didn't care.	Men alada etmedim.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu şeýle bolmaly.
It's really something.	Ol hakykatdanam bir zat.
I was really good for a while	Biraz wagt hakykatdanam gowy boldum
He allowed me to help you.	Maňa size kömek etmäge mümkinçilik berdi.
He is crazy about us.	Ol biz hakda däli.
Everyone is for themselves.	Her bir adam özi üçin.
In fact it takes two or three.	Aslynda iki ýa-da üç gerek.
That he is not alone.	Onuň ýeke däldigini.
This is new to me.	Bu meniň üçin täze.
I knew nothing	Men hiç zat bilmeýärdim
For help	Kömek üçin
That should be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaly.
Who knows.	Kim bilýär.
There is no such thing here.	Bu ýerde beýle zat ýok.
Maybe not at all	Belki asla bolmaz
I don't want anyone else	Başga birini islämok
I told you.	Men saňa aýtdym.
Oh, that's too short.	Aý, bu gaty gysga.
How did he know?	Nädip bilýärdi.
I could tell right away	Men derrew aýdyp bilýärdim
I think he was worried.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol alada galdy.
Probably the worst case scenario.	Iň erbet wagt belki.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I was not.	Men beýle däldim.
He could do nothing for her.	Ol onuň üçin hiç zat edip bilmedi.
There are several reasons for this	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar
It's a difficult task for a human being	Adam üçin kyn mesele
I do not have.	Mende ýok.
When did it come out?	Haçan çykdy.
This is also a very good thing.	Bu hem gaty gowy zat.
I can tell you what he thinks	Onuň pikir edýändigini aýdyp bilerin
Maybe there is something for them.	Belki, olar üçin bir zat bar bolsa gerek.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Irden has gowy, hakykatdanam.
Nothing can be said.	Hiç zat aýdyp bolmaz.
Great man, good man	Uly adam, gowy adam
Maybe something else.	Belki başga bir zat hem bolup biler.
I did everything.	Men hemme zady etdim.
I did nothing for you	Men saňa hiç zat etmedim
And then again.	Soň bolsa ýene bir gezek.
He had a new idea	Oňa täze pikir geldi
I have	Mende bar.
There was no problem.	Mesele ýokdy.
So it was very difficult to do that.	Şonuň üçin muny etmek gaty kyn boldy.
I could do nothing else	Men başga hiç zat edip bilmedim
There is nothing wonderful about it	Bu hakda ajaýyp zat ýok
It doesn't seem right.	Dogry däl ýaly.
I can't do anything about it	Men ol hakda hiç zat edip bilemok
Try something new.	Täze bir zady synap görmek.
Probably not.	Belki, beýle bolmaly däldi.
I have never seen anything like it	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim
Definitely full.	Elbetde doly.
Enough now.	Häzirki wagtda ýeterlik.
I'm sorry, but so be it.	Bagyşlaň, ýöne şeýle.
I can let him	Men oňa rugsat berip bilerin
Just talk and talk.	Diňe gürleşmek we gürleşmek.
It's like crazy.	Bu däli ýaly.
He was not much.	Ol kän däldi.
I will destroy you	Men seni ýok etjek men
I was very impressed	Mende gaty haýran galdy
He called her.	Ol oňa jaň etdi.
He was not such a person.	Ol beýle adam däldi.
Of course, there is still time for that.	Elbetde, munuň üçin entek wagt bar.
I'm ready for you	Men saňa taýyn
This is true for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin dogry.
Not bad, just good.	Erbet däl, diňe gowy.
He could never do it.	Hiç haçan edip bilmedi.
They should be this week.	Olar şu hepde bolmaly.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
Summer is off.	Tomus dynç aldy.
I can help with that.	Men muňa kömek edip bilerin.
I don't have to say that	Men muny aýtmaly däl
I can't say.	Men aýdyp biljek däl.
I could tell him everything	Men oňa hemme zady aýdyp bilýärdim
I know what happened	Näme bolandygyny bilýärin
This is it.	Bu şu.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýok.
Everyone knows this is not true.	Munuň dogry däldigini her kim biler.
I am just a man.	Men diňe bir adam.
Life is bad.	Durmuş erbet.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
So that's great.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty gowy.
This is new.	Bu täze.
I do now.	Men häzir edýärin.
This is for us too.	Bu hem biziň üçin.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
This is not true.	Munuň özi dogry däl.
We are not against it.	Biz garşy däl.
There was nothing like that before.	Öňküsi ýaly hiç zat ýokdy.
In fact, I didn't see the point	Aslynda munuň bir mesele bolandygyny görmedim
Not here.	Bu ýerde däl.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
Of course I do.	Elbetde, ynanýaryn.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
In fact, there are only two.	Aslynda diňe iki adam.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
I can tell you too	Size hem aýdyp bilerin
This allowed us to do	Bu bize etmäge mümkinçilik berdi
You can help.	Kömek edip bilersiňiz.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
I told you.	Men saňa aýtdym.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
Why does everyone want to go somewhere else?	Näme üçin her kim başga ýere gitmek isleýär?
Of course, I didn't think so	Elbetde, beýle pikir etmedim
Something interesting about that.	Bu hakda gyzykly zat.
I actually spent two months there.	Aslynda ol ýerde iki aý boldum.
It's everywhere	Hemme ýerde bar
Such a good man.	Şeýle gowy adam.
They are there, right there.	Olar şol ýerde, edil şol ýerde.
I think there is something there.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ýerde birneme bar.
It seemed interesting.	Bu gyzykly ýalydy.
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
That was nothing new.	Bu hem täze zat däldi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I'm really scared of you.	Men hakykatdanam seniň üçin gorkýaryn.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
We both came.	Ikimiz indi.
He could not promise it.	Ol muňa söz berip bilmedi.
Now those things are needed.	Indi ol zatlar gerek.
I think they have something else to do or something else	Başga etmeli zatlary ýa-da başga zatlary bar öýdýän
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
He did really well.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy etdi.
Not really.	Aslynda ýok.
Very close.	Gaty ýakyn.
He asked me for a job	Ol maňa iş sorady
For the first time, he ignored it.	Ilkinji gezek muňa üns bermedi.
This is great news	Bu uly habar
When	Haçan.
So you can go faster.	Şonuň üçin has çalt gidip bilersiňiz.
This is exactly what happened.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
To be better.	Has gowy bolmak.
I asked you a question	Men size bir sorag berdim
No one else wanted bad news.	Hiç kim mundan başga erbet habar islemedi.
I think he still does	Meniň pikirimçe, ol henizem şeýle edýär
Hopefully.	Umyt edip bolar.
She is just the eldest girl.	Ol diňe iň uly gyz.
Not many people knew that.	Muny köp adam bilmeýärdi.
I didn't think much of it	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmedim
I have money and stuff	Mende pul we zatlar bar
I could only speak for myself	Men diňe özüm üçin gürläp bilýärdim
Easy money, he told himself.	Aňsat pul, özüne aýtdy.
I can't say more right now.	Şu wagt has köp zat aýdyp biljek däl.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
He may be right.	Dogry aýdyp biler.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu bolmaly.
This is not a problem.	Munuň özi mesele däl.
For the next.	Indiki üçin.
Not human.	Adam däl.
I'm not against it.	Men beýle işe garşy däl.
It's good to go.	Gitmek gowy.
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
I just want to go	Men diňe gitmek isleýärin
Not really a bad person.	Aslynda erbet adam däl.
You must be aware that this is not possible	Munuň mümkin däldigini bilýän bolmaly
Not much there.	Ol ýerde kän däl.
Make it clear today.	Bu gün has aýdyň.
It looks really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy görünýär.
I still want to help you	Men henizem size kömek etmek isleýärin
There is a reason for this.	Munuň bir sebäbi bar.
It could just be me.	Bu diňe men bolup biler.
I think this is great	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir edýärin
He is the only one who can do it today.	Ol şu gün edip biljek ýeke-täk adam.
You don't have to buy the same thing.	Şol bir zady almaly däl.
I don't want to do anything else.	Başga bir zat etmek islämok.
The reason for everything	Hemme zadyň sebäbi
We are the most interesting.	Biz iň gyzykly.
Full.	Doly.
You have to decide.	Karar bermeli.
It would be very difficult for them.	Bu olar üçin gaty kyn bolardy.
Still gone.	Henizem gitdi.
What a girl there is	Ol ýerde nähili gyz bar
I tried other things	Başga zatlary synap gördüm
If necessary	Gerek bolsa.
I know what he's thinking	Men onuň näme hakda pikir edýändigini bilýärin
There was a time.	Bir wagt bardy.
It should be good.	Gowy bolmaly.
There must be two hundred people here.	Bu ýerde iki ýüz adam bolmaly.
It would be easy.	Bu aňsat bolardy.
The last question.	Soňky sorag.
They are smart.	Olar akylly.
OK, that's enough.	Bolýar, ýeterlik.
I know this best.	Men muny iň gowy bilýärin.
Not for himself.	Özi üçin däl.
I couldn't say no to him	Men oňa "ýok" diýip bilmedim
That's what I think of him.	Men onuň hakda şeýle pikir edýärin.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
I want to give it to you	Muny saňa bermek isleýärin
I've seen it happen before	Munuň öňem bolandygyny gördüm
This is good.	Bu gowy.
Of course he does.	Elbetde şeýle edýär.
He knew how to help.	Nädip kömek edip biljekdigini bilýärdi.
.	.
Those things are gone now.	Indi ol zatlar ýok.
Not for a few days.	Birnäçe gün däl.
I am not.	Men beýle däl.
He knows it's hard for you.	Siziň üçin kyn bolandygyny bilýär.
It may be two o'clock in the morning.	Belki, irden sagat iki bolup biler.
I didn’t think it was possible	Mümkin diýip pikir etmedim
I thought it was good	Gowy diýip pikir etdim
They are so worried.	Olar şeýle alada.
I think they must have happened this morning	Meniň pikirimçe, olar şu gün irden bolup geçen bolmaly
He was right.	Ol gaty dogry aýtdy.
Maybe so.	Mümkin şeýle bolar.
And now the two of us.	Indi bolsa ikimiz.
That's more	Bu has köp
It happened to me	Bu meniň bilen boldy
I told you so.	Men bu hakda size aýtdym.
This song is great	Bu aýdym ajaýyp
For him and for him.	Onuň we onuň üçin.
I think he knew that	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny bilýärdi
This is great news.	Bu ajaýyp habar.
If not too bad.	Gaty erbet däl bolsa.
That's what he said.	Ine, ol näme diýdi.
Okay, maybe every week.	Bolýar, belki her hepde.
This is his job.	Bu onuň işi.
I want more	Mundan has köp zat isleýärin
No one wanted that.	Hiç kim muny islemedi.
Bad.	Erbet.
I can't just buy one	Men diňe birini satyn alyp bilemok
In fact, it is.	Hakykatdanam, bu şeýle.
There is no such thing here.	Bu ýerde beýle zat ýok.
I couldn't say anything else	Indi başga zat aýdyp bilmedim
I can see myself	Men özümi görüp bilýärin
So that’s a big deal.	Şonuň üçin bu uly mesele.
I could do nothing for him	Men oňa hiç zat edip bilmedim
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
Need more help.	Has köp kömek etmeli.
I want to be happy for them.	Men olar üçin bagtly bolmak isleýärin.
What.	Näme.
I couldn't think of anything else to do	Başga etjek zadym hakda pikir edip bilmedim
I can be whatever you want	Islän zadyň bolup bilerin
I have no answer	Mende jogap ýok
Everyone wants me.	Meni hemmeler isleýär.
This is new to me.	Bu meniň üçin täze bolýar.
I want to talk to you	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
This can be difficult to ask.	Muňa sorag bermek kyn bolup biler.
I haven't seen him much	Men ony kän görmedim
They are there.	Olar şol ýerde.
It may take a few days.	Birnäçe gün gerek bolup biler.
I will have nothing else	Mende başga zat bolmaz
Two years ago.	Iki ýyl mundan ozal.
I didn’t know why he wanted to see it	Näme üçin görmek isleýändigini bilmedim
It's just money.	Bu diňe pul.
That or the sound.	Şol ýa-da ses.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
It happened, but not often.	Bu boldy, ýöne köplenç däl.
I can actually get some more	Aslynda ýene birneme alyp bilerin
It looks better.	Bu has gowy görünýär.
Not for me yet.	Entek maňa däl.
I have to give it to him	Men oňa bermeli
In fact, there was nothing he could do about it	Aslynda onuň üçin edip biljek zady ýokdy
You never have to do anything twice.	Hiç haçan iki gezek hiç zat etmeli däl.
Really weird.	Hakykatdanam gaty geň.
I couldn't get any answers	Men hiç hili jogap alyp bilmedim
Often the work is not so difficult.	Köplenç iş beýle kyn däl.
The message has arrived, you can tell.	Habar geldi, aýdyp bilersiňiz.
In fact, this man is nowhere to be found.	Aslynda bu adam hiç ýerde ýok.
It's a long way off.	Bu uzak ýol.
He had an hour left.	Ol bir sagat galdy.
I just couldn't sleep	Men diňe uklap bilmedim
Of course, this is the case.	Elbetde, bu mesele.
I can't see it again	Men muny ýene görüp bilemok
There is nothing new or interesting here.	Bu ýerde täze ýa-da gyzykly zat ýok.
I admire you very much	Men size gaty haýran
I think he wants you	Meniň pikirimçe, ol sizi isleýär
A lot of bad things have happened	Köp erbet zatlar boldy
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman däl.
This is never easy.	Bu hiç haçan aňsat däl.
I wanted to help	Kömek etjek boldum
I need a man	Maňa adam gerek
The time was short.	Wagt gysga boldy.
There was no time to answer.	Jogap bermek üçin wagt ýokdy.
He started again.	Ol ýene başlady.
He was as surprised as anyone.	Ol hemmeler ýaly geň galdy.
This will do the right thing for you.	Bu siziň üçin dogry zady eder.
I only have one message.	Mende diňe bir habar bar.
Everyone had fun.	Her kim hezil etdi.
I don't know if this is the case.	Munuň bardygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny bilenok.
You can try it for a week.	Ony bir hepde synap görüp bilersiňiz.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
What fun.	Nähili hezil.
A week later.	Soň bir hepde.
I think this is a really bad thing	Bu hakykatdanam erbet zat diýip pikir edýärin
He knows that.	Ol muny bilýär.
He made me very anxious.	Ol meni gaty biynjalyk etdi.
It's not just money.	Bu diňe pul däl.
You know he can.	Biljekdigini bilýärsiň.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
I haven't seen it yet	Men ony entek görmedim
I asked him a lot of questions	Men oňa köp sorag berdim
No one has ever done that.	Hiç kim bu meseläni hiç wagt etmedi.
I think it will be difficult.	Bu kyn bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
Not me, no.	Men däl, ýok.
I know what this does to us	Munuň bize näme edýändigini bilýärin
I didn't know what it was	Munuň näme bolandygyny bilmedim
I really need to stop doing that.	Men hakykatdanam muny etmegi bes etmeli.
It was evening, and one morning it was.	Agşam bardy, bir gün irden bardy.
I've only done this twice.	Men muny diňe iki gezek etdim.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şeýle zat.
It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
Of course, he said.	Elbetde, ol aýtdy.
You have	Sen bar
I knew what to do	Näme etmelidigini bilýärdim
It looks great.	Bu gaty gowy görünýär.
I think it could be worse	Has erbet bolmagy mümkin diýip pikir edýärin
I think that's right	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry
It was a good day for me.	Munuň ýaly bir gün üçin gowy iş boldy.
He helped her.	Oňa kömek etdi.
He could see nothing.	Ol hiç zady görüp bilmedi.
I'm happy with that	Men munuň bilen bagtly
I've always been there	Men hemişe şol ýerde boldum
There was something.	Bir zat bardy.
I am very good.	Men gaty gowy.
Of course for a reason.	Elbetde bir sebäp.
It's not just me.	Bu diňe men däl.
This is a great idea.	Bu ajaýyp pikir.
It was not enough to do.	Etmek ýeterlik däldi.
I just did something stupid	Men diňe samsyk bir zat etdim
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I'm so scared.	Men gaty gorkýaryn.
Good question.	Gowy sorag.
And now you are very good to me.	Indi bolsa sen maňa gaty gowy.
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şeýle boldy.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
And then it happened.	Soň bolsa boldy.
I can't go to school	Men mekdebe baryp bilemok
He took me here.	Ine, meni şu ýere alyp gitdi.
I was stupid to tell you at the time	Şol wagt saňa aýtmak samsyk boldum
Tell me about it.	Ol hakda maňa aýdyň.
There is great news for you	Siziň üçin uly habar bar
He is a young man.	Ol ýigit.
He seems to be doing nothing.	Hiç zat edip bilmeýän ýaly.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
I didn’t want to do much about it	Bu hakda kän bir zat etmek islemedim
I call, but there is no answer	Men jaň edýärin, ýöne jogap ýok
So he must have thought about it before.	Şonuň üçin bu hakda öňem pikir eden bolmaly.
We need it	Bize gerek
I thought we should go	Biz gitmeli diýip pikir etdim
I don't have to	Mende bolmaly däl
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
Just like him.	Edil onuň ýaly.
This is very strange, very strange.	Bu gaty geň, gaty geň.
There was hope	Umyt boldy
He did not want to take it.	Ol muny almak islemedi.
I had fun.	Men hezil etdim.
Another if there is a call.	Jaň bar bolsa başga.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, sen karar bermeli.
This seems strange.	Bu geň görünýär.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe dogry zat.
I was not always an adult	Men elmydama uly adam däldim
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
I let him.	Men oňa rugsat berdim.
I do nothing	Men hiç zat etmeýärin
There are several possibilities.	Birnäçe mümkinçilik bar.
And then it happened to him.	Soň bolsa oňa boldy.
Looks a little happy now.	Häzir birneme bagtly görünýär.
Did it help?	Bu kömek etdi?
Everything there is wonderful.	Ol ýerde hemme zat ajaýyp.
I didn't know what to do with them	Olar bilen näme etmelidigimi bilmedim
I saw no way and no way	Hiç hili ýol we ýol görmedim
I had a good night	Gowy gije boldum
I don't believe that	Men muňa ynanamok
No one really knew why he did that.	Aslynda näme üçin beýle edenini hiç kim bilmeýärdi.
What a strange question.	Nähili geň sorag.
Not like me.	Men ýaly däl.
No more.	Indi ýok.
I can't do that to him	Men oňa muny edip bilemok
Not just now.	Diňe şu wagt däl.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
It's great there.	Ol ýerde gaty gowy.
I have an idea.	Mende bir pikir bar.
I want to answer you	Men size jogap bermek isleýärin
I'm worried about you	Men seni biynjalyk edýärin.
No answer needed.	Jogap gerek däl.
He knows that.	Ol muny bilýär.
Really long ago	Hakykatdanam köp wagt ozal
There was just no one.	Diňe hiç kim ýokdy.
Something like seeing twice.	Iki gezek görmek ýaly bir zat.
You have to do the same.	Edil şol bir zady etmeli.
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
I couldn’t do anything else with that	Munuň bilen başga bir zat edip bilmedim
It was not difficult.	Bu gaty kyn däldi.
What did he do?	Ol näme etdi?
It should be.	Bu bolmaly.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
Is that so?	Ol şeýlemi?
He said it, he said it.	Ol muny aýtdy, şeýle diýdi.
It looks worse.	Has erbet görünýär.
I had to admit he knew what he was doing	Onuň näme edýändigini bilýändigini boýun almaly boldum
Nothing is nothing.	Hiç zat hiç zat däl.

I bought a few good books for him	Men onuň üçin birnäçe gowy kitap satyn aldym
I heard it here.	Men muny şu ýerde eşitdim.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman dogry etmedi.
Maybe he didn't really want to.	Belki, hakykatdanam islemedi.
There was a good reason for that.	Munuň üçin gowy sebäp bardy.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Just a matter of time.	Diňe bir mesele.
No one paid attention to us.	Hiç kim bize üns bermedi.
It's beautiful and beautiful.	Bu ajaýyp we ajaýyp.

You can do it.	Ony edip bilersiňiz.

This will not be true a few hundred years later	Mundan birnäçe ýüz ýyl soň bu dogry bolmaz
He will do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly eder.
I am nothing and everything.	Men hiç zat we hemme zat däl.
You have to get a few things	Birnäçe zat almaly
And then.	Soň bolsa.
It should not be allowed.	Oňa rugsat bermeli däl.
It will not be so.	Ol beýle bolmaz.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu dogry ýol.
I can't help you anymore	Men size ýene kömek edip bilemok
It probably takes a lot of time to make a decision.	Karar bermek üçin gaty köp wagt gerek bolsa gerek.
It was a year ago.	Bir ýyl mundan ozal bardy.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
I had to do it again	Men muny ýene etmeli boldum
I don't want it	Men ony islämok
He is a very bad man.	Ol gaty erbet adam.
He started working.	Ol işe başlady.
I want something	Men bir zat isleýärin
He wanted to tell the truth.	Ol hakykaty aýtmak isledi.
I just want the truth.	Men diňe hakykaty isleýärin.
Maybe nothing at all.	Belki asla hiç zat ýok.
It's good, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Gowy "-diýdi.
He could do nothing.	Ol hiç zat edip bilmedi.
I didn't care anymore.	Indi alada etmedim.
Not really, that's bad.	Çynlakaý däl, bu erbet.
He told himself everything would be fine.	Ol özüne hemme zadyň gowy boljakdygyny aýtdy.
Maybe it helped.	Belki kömek eden bolsa gerek.
That was the problem.	Bu mesele boldy.
I had nothing	Mende hiç zat ýokdy
I can't	Men edip bilemok
Of course.	Elbetde.
It would be very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat bolardy.
I can't say enough good things about him	Men ol hakda ýeterlik gowy zatlar aýdyp biljek däl
I think it looks so beautiful	Bu gaty owadan görünýär diýip pikir edýärin
There are many reasons for this.	Munuň köp sebäbi bar.
In fact, he is very good.	Aslynda ol gaty gowy.
We can't say for sure.	Dogry aýdyp bilmeris.
We are together	Biz bilelikde.
This is more likely.	Bu has ähtimal.
No problem here.	Bu ýerde mesele ýok.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I think it turned out well	Gowy çykdy diýip pikir edýärin
I can't tell you about them right now	Men häzir olar hakda size aýdyp biljek däl
This is bad news.	Bu erbet habar.
I was happy	Men bagtly boldum
I don't know what happened to him	Men oňa näme bolandygyny bilemok
I was fine.	Men gowy boldum.
Of course, there was no question.	Elbetde, sorag ýokdy.
I'm not good enough	Men ýeterlik däl
I'm here today.	Men şu gün şu ýerde.
I already had it.	Mende öňem bardy.
I can't agree with that	Men muňa razy bolup bilemok
I did nothing wrong here	Bu ýerde hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedim
I want to say that	Men muny aýtmak isleýärin
Because that's right.	Sebäbi bu dogry.
He asked what he could actually do.	Aslynda näme edip biljekdigini sorady.
It will not be the first time.	Ilkinji gezek bolmaz.
I have money, I have a lot of money	Mende pul bar, köp pul bar
A big challenge for	Üçin uly kynçylyk
There was something like an hour there.	Ol ýerde bir sagat ýaly bir zat bardy.
I often.	Men köplenç.
I have	Mende bar.
I'll be here if you need anything.	Size bir zat gerek bolsa şu ýerde bolaryn.
I think he always has	Meniň pikirimçe, ol elmydama bar
All I can say about them is.	Men diňe olar hakda aýdyp bilerin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe bir zat.
He must have seen it earlier	Hakykatdanam muny has ir gören bolmaly
I have bad news.	Mende erbet habar bar.
It will one day.	Bu bir gün bolar.
It is likely to be many weeks.	Köp hepde bolmagy ähtimal.
He did the only thing.	Ol ýeke-täk zady etdi.
This is my first time.	Bu meniň ilkinji gezek.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
With that.	Munuň bilen.
I think that's what he wants	Bu isleýän zady öýdýän
Whatever was there was not human.	Ol ýerde näme bar bolsa, adam däldi.
He is crazy.	Ol däli.
It's harder to do that.	Muny etmek has kyn.
Because he knows it better.	Sebäbi muny has gowy bilýär.
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hakda hiç zat ýok
There is no problem here.	Bu ýerde hiç hili mesele ýok.
What, this.	Näme, şu.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
I couldn't say a word about it.	Men bu barada bir söz aýdyp bilmedim.
It's been a few years.	Birnäçe ýyl boldy.
I didn't want to do that	Men muny etmek islemedim
You will need it.	Size gerek bolar.
I've heard a lot about you	Men sen hakda köp eşitdim
Just like now	Edil häzirki ýaly.
It may be helpful to answer.	Jogap bermek üçin kömek bolup biler.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim
Bad man.	Erbet, adam.
That's what happened to me.	Bu meniň üçin şeýle boldy.
It does two things.	Bu iki zady edýär.
There should be a little more tomorrow	Ertir birneme köp bolmaly
We are ready for that.	Biz muňa taýyn.
I don't want to be here.	Men bu ýerde bolmak islämok.
I want to talk to you	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
I miss you so much	Men seni gaty isleýärin
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
I couldn't speak or think	Men gürläp ýa pikir edip bilmedim
By going home.	Öýe gitmek bilen.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
She is a really beautiful girl.	Ol hakykatdanam ajaýyp gyz.
We can go somewhere with that.	Munuň bilen bir ýere baryp bileris.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
In fact, there are things like that.	Aslynda onuň ýaly zatlary bar.
It's hard to see anything.	Hiç zady görmek kyn.
I know, this is life.	Bilýärin, bu durmuş.
I had something very good	Mende gaty gowy zat bardy
Not everyone is like me.	Hemmeler meniň ýaly däl.
I couldn't let that happen	Men muňa ýol berip bilmedim
I didn't know there was such a thing	Munuň ýaly zadyň bardygyny bilmedim
It really happened.	Bu hakykatdanam boldy.
I said that.	Men muny aýtdym.
It's kind of interesting.	Bu bir hili gyzykly.
This is different.	Bu başga.
More money.	Has köp pul.
I can't see it myself	Muny özüm görüp bilemok
It was like a lot of work.	Köp iş ýalydy.
This was not his first time, of course.	Elbetde, bu onuň ilkinji gezek däldi.
It's not for me, though.	Bu meniň üçin däl, ýöne.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
Summer, of course.	Elbetde, tomus.
This is everything and nothing.	Bu hemme zat we hiç zat däl.
I want to go there one day	Bir gün ol ýere gitmek isleýärin
It was as if everyone knew about it.	Hemmeler bu hakda bilýän ýalydy.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal bu hakda asla pikir etmedim
I thought about it this morning	Men bu hakda irden pikir etdim
He did.	Ol şeýle etdi.
So not too bad.	Şonuň üçin gaty erbet däl.
It really happened.	Bu hakykatdanam boldy.
In fact, I didn't know that	Aslynda muny bilmeýärdim
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili erbet zat ýok.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
Must be for everyone!	Hemmeler üçin hökman bolmaly!
It was as if he had seen me for the first time.	Ol edil meni ilkinji gezek gören ýaly boldy.
It always happens here.	Bu ýerde hemişe bolýar.
This is a real possibility, but not the only one.	Bu hakykatdanam bir mümkinçilik, ýöne ýeke-täk zat däl.
I can give it a try	Muny synap görüp bilerin
I didn't think so!	Men beýle pikir etmedim!.
I don't have much to do today	Bu gün etmeli köp zadym ýok
I saw a lot here	Men bu ýerde köp zady gördüm
Everyone was right.	Hemmeler dogry aýtdy.
He has been out of work for some time.	Birnäçe wagt bäri işden çykdy.
I was not ready for that	Men muňa taýyn däldim
Someone there told me.	Ol ýerde bir adam maňa aýtdy.
Of course I knew this was not for me	Elbetde munuň meniň üçin däldigini bilýärdim
More, more.	Köp, has köp.
Now you can go home.	Indi öýe gaýdyp bilersiňiz.
I hope someone can tell	Kimdir biri aýdyp biler diýip umyt edýärin
I haven't seen it yet	Men henizem ony görüp bilmedim
I was so bad for a week	Bir hepde gaty erbet boldum
I saw this happen.	Munuň bolandygyny gördüm.
I told you he knows everything	Men saňa hemme zady bilýändigini aýtdym
I thought it was for me	Bu meniň üçin diýip pikir etdim
Why so many?	Näme üçin beýle köp?
I thought of something	Men bir zat hakda pikir etdim
Because he probably knows.	Sebäbi ol bilýän bolsa gerek.
In addition.	Mundan başga.
I don't care.	Men bu barada alada etmeýärin.
I really don't need it.	Maňa hakykatdanam gerek däl.
He took it right and took it himself.	Dogry alyp, özi alyp gitdi.
What is this	Bu näme.
He seems to know something about them.	Olar hakda bir zat bilýän ýaly.
It takes work.	Munuň üçin iş gerek.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
I think a lot about you	Men sen hakda köp pikir edýärin
I knew it was just bad news	Munuň diňe erbet habar bolup biljekdigini bilýärdim
He thought he needed something.	Ol özüne gerek zat diýip pikir etdi.
He was right.	Ol dogry aýtdy.
If you need it.	Gerek bolsa size.
She looked like a really beautiful person.	Ol hakykatdanam owadan adam ýalydy.
You know, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Bilýärsiň, bu ajaýyp.
Good.	Gowy.
There was something strange about it.	Bu ýerde geň bir zat bardy.
I just have a quick question	Mende diňe çalt sorag bar
Good.	Gowy.
Why is it so good?	Näme üçin beýle gowy?
I agree again.	Men ýene razy.
I have this job	Mende bu iş bar
It makes him human.	Bu ony adam edýär.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
It was a while ago.	Bu birneme öňem bardy.
Of course, this is very strange.	Elbetde, bu gaty geň.
Not really.	Hakykatdanam beýle däl.
You are nothing	Sen hiç zat däl
There was no work for him.	Onuň üçin hiç hili iş ýokdy.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
You have to do some work today	Bu gün biraz iş etmeli
He gave it to me.	Ol maňa berdi.
He may or may not do so.	Ol muny edip biler ýa-da edip bilmez.
How many, can't tell.	Näçe, aýdyp bilmeýär.
The reason for this is us. 	Munuň sebäbi bolsa biz. 
It's hard to know what to do.	Näme etmelidigini bilmek kyn.
He was still there.	Ol henizem bardy.
In fact, it could be next time.	Aslynda indiki gezek bolup biler.
This is not an easy decision.	Bu aňsat karar däl.
It's been a week	Bu ýerde bir hepde
He knows that.	Muny bilýär.
Serious money.	Çynlakaý pul.
He would be gone.	Ol ýok bolardy.
I thought.	Men pikir etdim.
And then it was everywhere.	Soň bolsa hemme ýerde boldy.
I had to call him	Men oňa jaň etmeli boldum
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat gowy.
I think he knows that too	Meniň pikirimçe, muny hem bilýär
I can't do it all for you	Hemmesini seniň üçin edip bilemok
This was not the first time.	Bu hem ilkinji gezek däldi.
Then he returned to work.	Soň bolsa işe gaýdyp geldi.
I am not such a person.	Men beýle adam däl.
He called and he called.	Jaň etdi we jaň etdi.
That can't be the case now.	Ol häzir beýle bolup bilmez.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
He seemed to want to help her.	Oňa kömek etmek isleýän ýalydy.
I hope this is not a mistake	Bu ýalňyşlyk däl diýip umyt edýärin
It happens.	Bu bolýar.
I still don't believe it	Men entek muňa ynanamok
We can do that too.	Muny hem edip bileris.
This is not the case.	Bu däl.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
I was not.	Men beýle däldim.
In fact, there is nothing new.	Aslynda täze zat ýok.
It would be harder to do that.	Muny etmek has kyn bolardy.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda kän etmeli däl.
It's not just you.	Bu diňe siz däl.
This is not for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin däl.
He wants more.	Has köp zat isleýär.
This is an impossible task.	Bu mümkin däl mesele.
I need money	Maňa pul gerek
It's not that easy.	Diňe beýle aňsat däl.
No one answered.	Hiç kim jogap bermedi.
I thought so at the time	Men şol wagt şeýle pikir etdim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Muny etmek üçin şeýle bolup biler.
I couldn't see it anywhere	Men ony hiç ýerde görüp bilmedim
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
Of course, he knew why.	Elbetde, näme üçin muny etmelidigini bilýärdi.
I have never been able to do that	Men hiç wagt beýle zady edip bilmedim
I have money	Mende pul bar
He returned to work in the morning.	Ir bilen işe gaýdyp geldi.
This is not the case either.	Bu hem däl.
I can tell you the truth.	Men size hakykaty aýdyp bilerin.
They are bad.	Olar erbet.
In a short time	Gysga wagtda.
Everything was crazy.	Hemme zat däli boldy.
He said for a few days	Birnäçe gün diýdi
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
Great song.	Ajaýyp aýdym.
I even thought about something else last night	Hatda düýn agşam başga bir zat hakda pikir etdim
It came again last week.	Geçen hepde ýene geldi.
I did not object	Men muňa garşy däldim
Only they or me	Diňe olar ýa-da men
It sounded like bad news to him.	Bu oňa erbet habar ýalydy.
It was kind of like.	Ol bir hili ýalydy.
Next time.	Indiki gezek.
I did something easier	Has aňsat zady etdim
It was night.	Gije boldy.
Of course where it should be.	Elbetde nirede bolmaly.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
He did not know.	Ol bilmeýärdi.
Many hours.	Köp sagat.
I can't do that much.	Men beýle köp zat edip bilemok.
Not so easy.	Munuň ýaly aňsat däl.
He knew that.	Muny bilýärdi.
Not bad, but not good.	Erbet däl, ýöne gowy däl.
He told her a lot.	Ol oňa köp zady aýtdy.
We both need it here.	Ikimizem şu ýerde zerur.
I know these things	Men bu zatlar hakda bilýärin
I'm really sorry about that.	Men muňa hakykatdanam gynanýaryn.
That's all he needs.	Oňa gerek zat.
He did it later.	Soň etdi.
Maybe you can help me	Belki, maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz
It was too short to try something.	Bir zady synap görmek gaty gysga boldy.
The same is true today.	Edil häzirki wagtda edil şonuň ýaly.
No one is coming here anymore.	Indi bu ýere hiç kim gelenok.
You have nothing.	Saňa hiç zat ýok.
Maybe there is another way.	Belki başga bir ýol bar bolsa gerek.
This is difficult.	Bu kyn.
I just can't stop thinking about it	Diňe bu hakda pikir etmegi bes edip bilemok
I didn't have to know anything else	Maňa başga zady bilmek hökman däldi
I saw it here.	Men ony şu ýerde gördüm.
It was too short for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gysga boldy.
That alone was not enough.	Diňe ýeterlik däldi.
I have always been close to him	Men oňa hemişe ýakyn boldum
I had enough of it.	Men oňa ýeterlik boldum.
It should be here for three days.	Bu ýerde üç gün bolmaly.
I think that's for sure	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hökman
Elsewhere.	Başga ýerde ýok.
I thought he was you	Men ol sen diýip pikir etdim
He could not do anything about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat edip bilmedi.
He is a good guy.	Ol gowy ýigit.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
There really is no other way.	Hakykatdanam başga ýol ýok.
I can do this very well.	Muny gaty gowy edip bilerin.
It's not anywhere.	Bu hiç ýerde däl.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Of course not.	Elbetde ýok.
There was money somewhere.	Bir ýerde pul bardy.
This is exactly what happened.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
He gave it to me a while ago.	Ol maňa birneme öň berdi.
This was not what he had hoped for.	Bu onuň umyt eden zady däldi.
There was no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýokdy.
To be surprised.	Geň bolmak.
I got it today.	Men ony şu gün aldym.
I can't help it	Men oňa kömek edip bilemok
Now he knew.	Indi bilýärdi.
I can't do it anymore	Indi edip bilemok
I haven't been able to tell before	Men öňem aýdyp bilmedim
I think he decided	Meniň pikirimçe, ol karar berdi
Coming too fast.	Gaty çalt gelýär.
I saw what happened.	Näme bolandygyny gördüm.
I have never been so happy.	Men hiç wagt beýle bagtly däldim.
It wasn't that serious.	Şeýle çynlakaý däldi.
I must have seen this before	Men muny öňem gören bolmaly
It could be that.	Ol hem bolup biler.
I want more	Men has köp zat isleýärin
I always want that	Men muny hemişe isleýärin
It was very frustrating	Bu gaty biynjalyk boldy
Came for the last three weeks.	Soňky üç hepde üçin geldi.
That's enough, I'm busy here.	Men ýeterlik, bu ýerde meşgul.
It was not the last time.	Ol soňky gezek däldi.
I didn't know it could happen	Bolup biljekdigini bilmedim
He said.	Ol şeýle diýdi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Indi geldi.
I even told him a lot.	Men hatda oňa köp zady aýtdym.
I did not know	Bilmedim
Not just me.	Diňe menden däl.
It's hard to do well.	Gowy etmek gaty kyn.
I didn't want to talk to him about it	Men onuň bilen bu hakda gürleşmek islemedim
Bad man	Erbet adam
I did a lot tonight	Men şu gije köp zat etdim
I told her everything	Men oňa bu hakda hemme zady aýtdym
He has helped me many times.	Ol maňa köp gezek kömek etdi.
I knew him better now.	Men ony indi has gowy bilýärdim.
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
A good person can be bad	Gowy adam erbet bolup biler
He is still there.	Ol henizem şol ýerde.
Do it once.	Bir gezek et.
You don't have to worry about anything	Hiç zat hakda alada etmeli däl
I enjoyed it.	Mundan lezzet aldym.
Nothing can happen.	Hiç zat bolup bilmez.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
I want that	Men muny isleýärin
You are not crazy	Sen däli däl
He said he wanted to talk to me.	Ol meniň bilen gürleşmek isleýändigini aýtdy.
I can't tell you anything	Men saňa hiç zat aýdyp biljek däl
I thought, no.	Men pikir etdim, ýok.
Can you do this for me?	Muny meniň üçin edip bilersiňizmi?
There is no one like me.	Meniň ýaly adam ýok.
I think so.	Men şeýle pikir edýärin.
I can't let anyone do that	Hiç kime beýle etmäge rugsat berip bilemok
I heard what happened today	Şu gün näme bolandygyny eşitdim
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men munuň mümkin däldigini aýtdym
I am with them and they are with me	Men, olar bilen we olar, meniň bilen
I was not for that.	Men munuň üçin däldim.
I don't want to talk about it.	Men bu hakda gürleşmek islämok.
Nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýok.
Everything will be fine.	Hemme zat bolar.
I'm calling	Men jaň edýärin
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
I had to lend him	Men oňa karz bermeli boldum
I think that’s more	Meniň pikirimçe, bu has köp
To vote.	Ses bermek üçin.
It's bigger than me now.	Bu indi menden uly.
It was difficult.	Kyn boldy.
Now I think there is someone	Indi kimdir biri barmy diýip pikir edýärin
I haven't tried it yet.	Entek synap görmedim.
With someone	Biri bilen.
There is no future.	Geljek ýok.
I think it will be good	Gowy bolar öýdýän
There is nothing more beautiful.	Has owadan zat ýok.
It can't hurt.	Zyýan berip bilmez.
I have to give it to him	Men oňa bermeli
There is another, more obvious reason.	Başga bir, has aýdyň sebäp bar.
A lot of work this week.	Bu hepde gaty köp iş.
I don't know anything about you	Men sen hakda hiç zat bilemok
He did not respond.	Ol muňa jogap bermedi.
You are there.	Sen şol ýerde.
This is a very interesting thing.	Bu gaty gyzykly zat.
I can sleep at night now	Men häzir gije uklap bilýärin
There was only one thing.	Diňe bir zat bardy.
I still don't believe it	Men henizem muňa ynanamok
There is good news for you	Siziň üçin gowy habar bar
It could be good.	Gowy bolup biler.
Someone should always be worried.	Elmydama kimdir biri biynjalyk bolmaly.
I thought he would come back	Men gaýdyp geler öýdüpdim
More	Has köp.
I must have done it myself.	Muny özüm eden bolmaly.
I was not, and he was not	Men beýle däldim, ol hem däldi
The sun is beautiful.	Gün owadan.
He was greeted by many people everywhere	Ony hemme ýerde köp adam garşy aldy
He was absolutely right.	Ol düýbünden dogry aýtdy.
I'm not as young as they used to be.	Men olar ýaly ýaş däl.
Short time	Gysga wagt.
I don't know anything about him.	Men ol hakda hiç zat bilemok.
It's very difficult.	Gaty kyn.
I hope I helped you.	Size kömek etdim diýip umyt edýärin.
I was there again	Men ýene şol ýerde boldum
It was hard.	Bu kyn boldy.
It's very close to me.	Bu maňa gaty ýakyn.
I knew it was real	Munuň hakykatdanam bardygyny bilýärdim
In fact, the idea came to him.	Aslynda bu pikir oňa geldi.
Of course, this is not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däl.
I know this will be bad	Munuň erbet boljakdygyny bilýärin
I could not say anything	Men hiç zat aýdyp bilmedim
It is no longer new, it is not new.	Ol indi täze däl, indi täze däl.
That was the decision he made.	Bu oňa karar berdi.
It's been a long time.	Köp boldy.
Where is the problem.	Mesele nirede.
Money seemed like a good thing at the time.	Şol wagt pul gowy zat ýalydy.
I hope so	Beýle bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin
You really have to take a lot.	Hakykatdanam köp zat almaly.
Ma'am.	Bu.
I think there is more to it	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ýerde has köp zat bar
There was something very difficult about him.	Ol hakda gaty kyn zat bardy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şol bir zat.

I hope this is as good as it gets!	Bu hem edil şonuň ýaly gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin!
Oh! 	Aý!
And then summer comes.	Soň bolsa tomus gelýär.
This is another matter.	Bu başga mesele.
I never saw him	Men ony asla görmedim
I tried to call there, but could not find an answer	Men ol ýere jaň etjek boldum, jogap alyp bilmedim
It won't be that smart anymore	Indi beýle akylly bolmaz
It's great there.	Ol ýerde gaty gowy.
I can’t just be here one night	Men bu ýerde diňe bir gije bolup bilemok
Only.	Diňe.
I think it will actually be very close.	Aslynda gaty ýakyn bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
I'm not young anymore	Men indi ýaş däl
A new challenge.	Täze kynçylyk.
I want to be there to help	Kömek etmek üçin şol ýerde bolmak isleýärin
This statement was incorrect.	Bu söz dogry däldi.
He was there too.	Ol hem bardy.
I can't say enough about this book.	Bu kitap hakda ýeterlik zat aýdyp biljek däl.
There will never be enough for that.	Munuň üçin hiç wagt ýeterlik bolmaz.
Now something else.	Indi başga zat.
I've had a few.	Mende birnäçe boldy.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
It was not good.	Gowy däldi.

I never thought it would be so fast	Munuň çalt boljakdygyny pikir etmedim
All the time	Hemme gezek.
Of course we can now.	Elbetde, indi edip bileris.
He thought he could even fall asleep again.	Ol hatda ýene uklap biler diýip pikir etdi.
I know now.	Men indi bilýärin.
Always there	Hemişe bar.
I was fine	Men özüm gowy boldum
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Oh, something else.	Aý, başga zat.
I haven't tried anything	Men hiç zady synap görmedim
A girl for a girl	Bir gyz üçin bir gyz
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
I'm ready for it	Men muňa taýyn boldum
We will never know.	Biz hiç haçan bilmeris.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
I could always tell him the truth	Men oňa hemişe hakykaty aýdyp bilýärdim
I didn't see it that way	Men ony beýle görmedim
It will not happen immediately.	Derrew bolmaz.
We are at the moment.	Biz häzirki wagtda.
He received, not.	Aldy, däl.
I can tell you something	Men size bir zady aýdyp bilerin
I couldn’t do it at home	Men muny öýde edip bilmedim
What to do?	Näme etmeli?
It seemed wonderful to him.	Onuň üçin bu ajaýyp ýalydy.
Just like now	Edil şu wagt ýaly.
Of course, this is a very good decision.	Elbetde, gaty gowy karar.
There was no other way for us.	Biziň üçin başga ýol ýokdy.
I already knew it would happen	Munuň boljakdygyny öňem bilýärdim
I told you yesterday	Düýn saňa aýtdym
I didn't know it existed	Munuň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
There are two issues.	Iki mesele bar.
I need to get someone	Maňa kimdir birini almaly
Even if there is.	Hatda bar bolsa.
Maybe there is a good reason for that.	Belki, munuň gowy sebäbi bar.
I couldn't get enough	Men ýeterlik bolup bilmedim
Good.	Gowy.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
I'll make it big.	Men ony uly ederin.
This was not the case	Bu beýle däldi
I didn't have to call you yesterday	Düýn saňa jaň etmeli däldim
I can't do it anymore	Indi edip bilemok
I just know something happened	Men diňe bir zadyň bolandygyny bilýärin
From now on	Mundan beýläk
And now it is not.	Indi bolsa beýle däl.
He went there, but returned immediately.	Ol ýere gitdi, ýöne derrew gaýdyp geldi.
The problem was the way.	Mesele ýol boldy.
For nothing, for fun.	Hiç zat üçin, hezil üçin.
I think there was such a mistake before	Meniň pikirimçe, ozal beýle ýalňyşlyk bardy
Hope can help.	Umyt kömek edip biler.
I'm crazy, that's all.	Men däli boldum, ine şeýle.
Nothing can be done right now.	Şu wagt hiç zat edip bolmaz.
He still didn't look like a bad person to me.	Ol henizem maňa erbet adam ýaly däldi.
You are the worst	Iň erbet sen.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu dogry däl ýaly.
Necessary thing.	Zerur zat.
I know why he did it to me	Näme üçin meni beýle etmegine sebäp bolandygyny bilýärin
This could be the reason.	Munuň sebäbi bolup biler.
Of course you can do these things.	Elbetde, bu zatlary edip bilersiňiz.
In fact, it is not new.	Hakykatdanam, bu täze däl.
This is always the case for me.	Meniň üçin hemişe şeýle bolýar.
I still have to give	Men entek bermeli
I can definitely say that this is not my thing.	Munuň hökman meniň zadym däldigini aýdyp bilerin.
Nowadays, probably.	Häzirki wagtda, ähtimal.
He stayed there for three years	Ol üç ýyl şol ýerde galdy
So we can see that.	Şonuň üçin muny görüp bileris.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
I was ready this time	Men bu gezek taýyn boldum
It was not his business.	Bu onuň işi däldi.
I can do it myself	Muny özüm edip bilerin
This is not a job for me.	Bu meniň üçin iş däl.
We need something better.	Bize has gowy zat gerek.
That was not the case.	Bu mesele däldi.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
Of course I did.	Elbetde etdim.
I'm fine.	Men gowy.
I didn't, but he can't be alone	Etmedim, ýöne ol ýeke bolup bilmeýär
No worries, no worries.	Alada ýok, alada ýok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň bilen iş.
I didn't see it that way.	Men özümi beýle görmedim.
There was a loud noise	Gaty ses geldi
I need two days	Maňa iki gün gerek
They are one.	Olar bir.
I didn't think much of it	Men bu hakda gaty kyn pikir etmedim
He agreed.	Ol muňa razy boldy.
They were like something.	Olar bir zat ýalydy.
I can get it tonight, you can do it tomorrow	Şu gije alyp bilerin, ertir edip bilersiňiz
I just had to call him	Men oňa diňe jaň etmeli boldum
I thought it might be interesting.	Gyzykly bolup biler diýip pikir etdim.
A lot of time.	Wagt köp.
No one did much for it.	Hiç bir adam munuň üçin kän bir zat etmedi.
Not now, not the time he needs it most.	Indi däl, oňa iň mätäç wagty däl.
Good job, but just one job	Gowy iş, ýöne diňe bir iş
I made a bad decision	Erbet karar berdim
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
Every time.	Her gezek.
I have never tried this	Men muny hiç haçan synap görmedim
You need to rest a little.	Biraz dynç almaly.
I have to go now	Men indi gitmeli
I couldn’t really see things	Men zatlary hakykatdanam görüp bilmedim
I knew about you, but	Men sen hakda bilýärdim, ýöne
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I never thought I would be so happy	Men beýle bagtly bolaryn öýdemokdym
I don’t even think.	Hatda pikir etmeýärin.
I think it would be good	Gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
He doesn't have enough time for that.	Munuň üçin oňa ýeterlik wagt ýok.
He said no.	Ol indi ýok diýdi.
He was not there today.	Bu gün ol ýokdy.
He is also two people.	Şeýle hem, ol iki adam.
It took me three hours.	Munuň üçin üç sagat wagt aldym.
I don't do this at home	Men muny öýde hiç zat etmeýärin
I couldn't do anything wrong.	Men hiç hili ýalňyşlyk edip bilmedim.
I don't care.	Men muňa alada etmeýärin.
He is with us tonight.	Ol şu gije biziň bilen.
I didn't want to know that	Muny bilmek islemedim
I really don't know anything about it.	Men hakykatdanam hiç zat hakda hiç zat bilemok.
I think about it every day	Men ony her gün pikir edýärin
This is good.	Bu gowy.
I called, but no one was there	Jaň etdim, ýöne ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy
It has to be very close.	Bu gaty ýakyn bolmaly.
I got it.	Men aldym.
You have to go	Sen gitmeli
He will do the same today.	Ol şu gün şeýle eder.
And the money is there.	Pul bolsa şol ýerde.
More interesting.	Has gyzykly.
He was there.	Ol bardy.
This time there will be no mistake.	Bu gezek ýalňyşlyk bolmaz.
Good.	Gowy.
At that moment, I tried to call her	Şol wagt oňa jaň etjek boldum
You can see it there.	Şol ýerde görüp bilersiňiz.
Not surprisingly.	Geň däl.
I gave	Men berdim
He never worried about much.	Ol hiç wagt köp zat hakda alada etmedi.
The first two reasons are incorrect.	Ilkinji iki sebäp dogry däl.
I was very worried.	Köp alada galdy.
There.	Ol ýerde.
Morning and evening.	Irden we agşam.
The reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi.
At that time.	Şol wagt.
What a wonderful way to screw people over.	Bu zat nähili gowy!
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
He didn't tell me that.	Ol muny maňa aýtmady.
I paid full attention to it.	Men oňa doly üns berdim.
No one can do that.	Hiç kim muny edip bilmez.
I am not one	Men bir däl
I knew he would never buy it.	Hiç haçan satyn alyp bilmejekdigini bilýärdim.
No one could say a word.	Hiç kim bir söz aýdyp bilmedi.
Not just now.	Diňe häzir däl.
Both answers say the same thing.	Iki jogap hem bir zady aýdýar.
I never thought much	Men hiç haçan kän pikir etmedim
I want to be happy for you	Men siziň üçin bagtly bolmak isleýärin
It's so easy and beautiful.	Bu gaty aňsat we ajaýyp.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
I haven't been able to do that yet.	Men entek beýle zady edip bilýän adam bolup bilmedim.
There are many possibilities for this.	Munuň üçin köp mümkinçilik bar.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
What do you think of me that causes this?	Muňa sebäp bolýan meniň hakda näme hakda pikir edýärin
I must have seen it	Men muny gören bolmaly
I just thought so	Diňe şeýle diýip pikir etdim
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I thought it would be crazy, but it wasn't	Men däli bolar öýdüpdim, ýöne beýle däldi
I just didn't need a watch	Maňa diňe sagat gerek däldi
I really helped him	Men oňa hakykatdanam kömek etdim
I always do that	Men muny elmydama edýärin
It did a lot for me.	Bu meniň üçin köp zat etdi.
I can make a few suggestions	Birnäçe teklip berip bilerin
I was crazy.	Men däli boldum.
It's not about him.	Ol hakda däl.
I have a man	Mende bir adam bar
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
I'll do it here	Men muny şu ýerde ederin
He knows that.	Muny bilýär.
He didn't know how to do it.	Ol muny nädip bilýändigini bilmeýärdi.
There are many reasons for this.	Munuň köp sebäbi bar.
I can already see	Men eýýäm görüp bilýärin
Just two days.	Diňe iki gün.
Something impossible happened.	Mümkin däl zat boldy.
There is a man here for you.	Bu ýerde siziň üçin bir adam bar.
I do this for money	Men muny pul üçin edýärin
I could not see anything	Men hiç zady görüp bilmedim
I didn't think of anyone else	Başga biri hakda pikir etmedim
I didn't think about it.	Men oňa pikir etmedim.
He didn't know that anymore.	Ol indi beýle däldi, bilýärdi.
He has nothing.	Oňa hiç zat ýok.
This is a difficult task for us.	Bu biziň üçin kyn mesele.
He was not, he could not go.	Ol beýle däl, oňa baryp bilmedi.
Not bad at all.	Aslynda erbet däl.
I can't tell you what	Men saňa näme aýdyp biljek däl
It's been a long time.	Köp wagt boldy.
Good.	Gowy.
I should never have said that	Men hiç haçan aýtmaly däldim
He does not know.	Bilmeýär.
I was no longer young.	Men indi ýaş däldim.
I couldn't get enough of it	Men oňa ýeterlik bolup bilmedim
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people	Muny etmekden has gowy bilýän bolmaly
Who knows how many people.	Kim bilýär näçe adam.
I can't do enough	Men ýeterlik edip bilemok
It's great to have such fun.	Şeýle hezil etmek gaty gowy zat.
It's not just here.	Bu diňe şu ýerde däl.
He told me.	Ol maňa aýtdy.
I must have done those things	Men ol zatlary eden bolmaly
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilenok.
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
I almost did these things	Men bu zatlary diýen ýaly etdim
I think that's one thing	Meniň pikirimçe, bu bir zat
Of course.	Elbetde.
Why should everyone be crazy every day?	Näme üçin her gün her kime däli bolmaly?
I know it's not far away	Onuň uzak däldigini bilýärin
I am the only one here.	Men bu ýerde ýekeje adam.
He wanted to.	Ol isledi.
Strange, he thought.	Geň zat, diýip pikir etdi.
It was never for me.	Bu meniň üçin hiç wagt däldi.
I didn't think so.	Beýle bolar öýdemokdym.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
He wanted to know if he could help.	Kömek edip biljekdigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilmek isledi.
I hope this will be good with you.	Bu siziň bilen gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
What a crazy life.	Nähili däli durmuş.
I should never have agreed.	Men muňa hiç wagt razy bolmaly däldim.
There is no way to know this.	Muny bilmek üçin hiç hili ýol ýok.
Something was wrong about him.	Ol hakda bir zat dogry däldi.
I didn't think it was necessary	Zerur diýip pikir etmedim
It was really good.	Hakykatdanam gaty gowy boldy.
I should never have done that	Men muny hiç haçan etmeli däldim
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle zat ýok
What a bad word.	Nähili erbet söz.
Nothing was good.	Hiç zat gowy däldi.
It's not that bad.	Bu beýle erbet däl.
I haven't done it yet	Men entek etmedim
So it must be something else.	Şonuň üçin bu başga bir zat bolmaly.
That would be enough for many people.	Köp adam üçin ýeterlik bolardy.
Only two now.	Häzir diňe ikisi.
Just one day and time.	Diňe bir gün we wagt.
This seems very strange.	Bu gaty geň görünýär.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
There are too many answers to this, or not.	Muňa gaty köp jogap bar, ýa-da ýok.
A week later he called again.	Bir hepde soň ýene jaň etdi.

You can and should do better.	Has gowy edip bilersiňiz we etmeli.
Money from you	Pul senden
Who is he	Ol kim.
I can still help him	Men henizem oňa kömek edip bilerin
I got the better news for you.	Men size has gowy habar aldym.
It just can't happen.	Diňe bolup bilmez.
I heard a voice	Men ses eşitdim
I believe he can help me	Maňa kömek edip biljekdigine ynanýaryn
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
I don't want to talk about them.	Men olar hakda gürleşmek islämok.
No one called.	Hiç kim jaň etmedi.
I don’t know how to do that.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilemok.
It's hard to see.	Ony görmek gaty kyn.
I told you and I told you.	Men saňa aýtdym we aýtdym.
I had no problem.	Mende hiç hili mesele ýokdy.
She is really beautiful.	Ol hakykatdanam owadan.
I wasn't very good at it.	Men muňa kän bir gowy däldim.
This is once.	Bu bir gezek.
I can't give him anything he wants	Men oňa islän zadyny berip bilemok
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Maybe.	Belki.
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, muny edip bilmedi
There is something wrong with this guy.	Bu ýigit bilen bir zat bar.
I hope it will be enough once	Bir gezek ýeterlik bolar diýip umyt edýärin
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there. "	Bu "-diýdi.
I didn't mind that.	Men muňa birneme garşy däldim.
Maybe not.	Belki beýle däl.
It's hard to think otherwise.	Başga pikir etmek gaty kyn.
Now somewhere else.	Indi başga bir ýerde.
It's been a week.	Bu hepde boldy.
You will have to do something else.	Başga bir zat etmeli bolarsyňyz.
Maybe not for me, but for you.	Belki meniň üçin däl, seniň üçin.
Nothing can happen.	Hiç zat bolup bilmez.
I never wanted to hurt anyone	Men hiç haçan hiç kime zyýan bermek islemedim
He really can't.	Ol hakykatdanam edip bilmeýär.
I have to go	Men gitmeli
This is really difficult.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn.
You know what it was like.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilýärsiň.
I can't go to the police	Men polisiýa baryp bilemok
I knew it was for me	Munuň meniň üçin bolandygyny bilýärdim

I'll do it again.	Mundan beýläk ederin.
The same two.	Şol bir ikisi.
I need some help.	Biraz kömek isleýärin.
There was no one else to do it.	Muny etjek başga adam ýokdy.
There was something else, something very strange.	Başga bir zat, gaty geň zat bardy.
It was great to see that.	Muny görmek gaty gowy boldy.
Strange, right?	Geň zat, şeýlemi?
There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
Good job, once again.	Gowy iş, ýene bir gezek.

What, what happened?	Näme, näme boldy?
It was nothing.	Bu hiç zat däldi.
I think it happened before	Menden öňem bardy öýdýän
I didn't mean to offend you	Men saňa zyýan bermek islemedim
I haven't thought about it twice before.	Bu hakda öňem iki gezek pikir etmedim.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
He will be right.	Ol dogry bolar.
I have to leave immediately	Men derrew gitmeli
He thought it was strange.	Geň zat diýip pikir etdi.
I can do it myself	Muny özüm edip bilerin
No one wanted to.	Hiç kim islemedi.

It was not necessary to see this now	Muny häzir görmek hökman däldi
There is a problem now.	Häzirki wagtda bir mesele bar.
I've been here a long time.	Men bu ýerde köp wagt boldum.
And then I couldn't sleep.	Soň bolsa uklap bilmedim.
I thought it was good	Gowy diýip pikir etdim
He did well for himself.	Özi üçin gowy etdi.
I can't do that myself	Muny özüm edip bilemok
I have nothing for him	Mende onuň üçin zat ýok
This is the reality of life.	Bu durmuş hakykaty.
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
We are completely happy !!.	Biz doly bagtly !!.
Right there, right then and there.	Edil şol ýerde, edil şol wagt.
I didn't mean to offend you	Men muny gaty ses bilen aýtmak islemedim
I want to know more.	Has köp zady bilmek isleýärin.
I think he likes you.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol seni halaýar.
Not for a day.	Bir gün üçin däl.
I was very worried about you.	Men sen hakda gaty alada etdim.
I want to give it to her	Men oňa bermek isleýärin
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
It was just that.	Edil edil şonuň ýalydy.
This is really difficult.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn.
The bad news is completely different.	Erbet habar düýbünden başga zat.
The night was just a night.	Gije diňe gije boldy.
The time was not long ago.	Wagt öň däldi.
Seriously.	Çynlakaý.
I thought it might be.	Bolup biler öýdüpdim.
I didn't know that before	Men bu hakykaty öňem bilmeýärdim
What?	Näme?
I didn’t want to go anywhere with this guy	Bu ýigit bilen hiç ýere gitmek islemedim
You can't be loved.	Sizi has gowy görüp bolmaz.
I knew he wasn't that good	Men onuň beýle gowy däldigini bilýärdim
He knew better.	Ol has gowy bilýärdi.
I don’t seem to be helping him	Men oňa kömek etjek ýaly däl
Not for me.	Meniň üçin däl.
It can be beautiful.	Bu owadan bolup biler.
Great day and great week!	Ajaýyp gün we ajaýyp hepde!
It will not happen again.	Indi beýle bolmaz.
I didn't really know that	Men muny hakykatdanam bilmeýärdim
This is nothing new.	Bu hakykatdanam täze zat däl.
Okay.	Bolýar.
You can go now	Indi gidip bilersiňiz
I'm fine with that	Men munuň bilen gowy boldum
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
I have several calls	Mende birnäçe jaň bar
I made another life for myself.	Özüm üçin başga bir durmuş etdim.
He does this for you	Ol siziň üçin bu işi edýär
There was nothing wonderful about me.	Men hakda ajaýyp zat ýokdy.
I don’t know what that could be	Munuň näme bolup biljekdigini bilemok
I'll call him.	Men oňa jaň etjek.
You can get it.	Siz alyp bilersiňiz.
You know that now.	Muny indi bilýärsiň.
I am really better.	Men hakykatdanam has gowy.
I know, that's weird	Bilýärin, bu geň söz
I was a little worried there	Men ol ýerde birneme alada etdim
He always knows that.	Elmydama muny bilýär.
He says he wants to talk to you.	Siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýändigini aýdýar.
He never did.	Ol hiç haçan etmedi.
I really like it	Hakykatdanam halaýar diýip umyt edýärin
I haven't done anything wrong yet.	Men entek erbet zat etmedim.
Maybe you shouldn't	Belki etmeli däl
That's not a word.	Bu söz däl.
He was crazy.	Ol däli boldy.
It should be.	Bolmaly.
It's easy to do that.	Muny etmek aňsat.
The night was more fun.	Gije has gyzykly boldy.
This is an easy question.	Bu aňsat sorag.
Who knows what will happen next.	Indiki näme bolar, kim bilýär.
He doesn't need it.	Oňa mätäç däl.
It's actually worse.	Aslynda has erbet.
I think it will be great	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gaty gowy bolar
I did it.	Men muny etdim.
This is really you.	Bu hakykatdanam sen.
He seemed to want to help her.	Oňa kömek etmek isleýän ýalydy.
I want to do that.	Men muny etmek isleýärin.
We are different.	Biz başga.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki munuň sebäbi bolup biler.
I want to know	Men bilmek isleýärin.
He was there.	Ol ýerde bardy.
I can take this a little longer	Muny biraz uzak alyp bilerin
I knew something was going to happen	Bir zadyň boljakdygyny bilýärdim
I did everything for him	Men onuň üçin hemme zady etdim
I actually did the same thing twice	Aslynda iki gezek şol bir zady etdim
I never thought about it	Men bu barada hiç wagt pikir etmedim
It's time.	Bu sagat.
No one has done that before.	Mundan öň hiç kim muny etmedi.
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
He is right.	Dogry aýdýar.
It's just that.	Bu diňe.
I thought it had to be different	Başga ýol bilen bolmaly diýip pikir etdim
He knew he wasn't there.	Ol ýokdugyny bilýärdi.
I just want to be smart.	Diňe akylly bolmak isleýärin.
No.	Ýok.
I was worried about that	Men bu barada alada etdim
Good.	Gowy.
Just for me.	Diňe meniň üçin.
Slightly good, but no big deal	Biraz gowy, ýöne uly mesele ýok
.	.
He must have done it a few years ago	Birnäçe ýyl mundan ozal eden bolmaly
And then another one.	Soň bolsa başga biri.
How can you tell?	Nädip aýdyp bilersiňiz
He agrees with me.	Ol menden razy.
For dinner	Nahar üçin.
I can't say if he knows anything else	Başga bir zady biljekdigini ýa-da ýokdugyny aýdyp biljek däl
There is no news.	Hatda habar ýok.
You need	Size gerek.
There, you can go now.	Ol ýerde, häzir gidip bilersiňiz.
It will definitely be.	Ol hökman bolar.
It actually takes a year.	Aslynda bir ýyl gerek.
No one can do that.	Hiç kim muny edip bilmez.
I knew this was not true	Men munuň dogry däldigini bilýärdim
I can take care of myself for a few days	Birnäçe gün özüm hakda alada edip bilerin
Almost impossible.	Mümkin däl diýen ýaly.
It was fast.	Çalt boldy.
No one knows this better than you.	Muny senden gowy bilýän ýok.
Another night.	Gije başga.
He no longer calls me at home.	Ol indi meni öýde jaň etmeýär.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I knew something was wrong	Bir zadyň edil şu wagt däldigini bilýärdim
I can't try	Synap görüp bilemok
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I want it for myself	Men ony özüm üçin isleýärin
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
I didn't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däldim.
Of course there is.	Elbetde bar.
I had enough	Mende ýeterlik boldy
I can't see it here	Men bu ýerde görüp bilemok
An idea came to him	Oňa bir pikir geldi
I can take you home right now	Men seni şu wagt öýe alyp bilerin
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
I made the right decision	Dogry karar berdim
That's what he told me.	Ine, ol maňa aýtdy.
They are very easy.	Olar gaty aňsat.
He can't do that.	Ol muny edip bilmeýär.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
He was allowed to take her home.	Ony öýüne alyp gitmäge rugsat berdi.
About time.	Wagt hakda.
I'm sure he'll do well.	Gowy etjekdigine ynanýaryn.
I can't think of anything and nothing can happen yet	Men pikir edip bilemok we henizem hiç zat bolup bilemok
I think that was the case	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle boldy
So it was really hard.	Şonuň üçin bu hakykatdanam kyn boldy.
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu dogry däl.
I think this may be true even for many people	Köp adam üçin bu hatda dogry bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
There should be more people here.	Bu ýerde has köp adam bolmaly.
They are very complete.	Olar gaty doly.
This will also help the police.	Bu polisiýa hem kömek eder.
I need some help	Maňa biraz kömek gerek
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Bolýar, aslynda beýle zat ýok.
I can't give myself to him anymore	Indi özümi oňa berip bilemok
This is not the case with him today.	Bu gün onuň bilen düýbünden dogry däl.
No such idea.	Beýle pikir ýok.
If only there was one.	Diňe bir bar bolsa.
For him.	Onuň üçin.
I don't know anything, I don't really know anything	Men hiç zady bilemok, aslynda hiç zat bilemok
If so, no worries.	Şeýle bolsa, alada ýok.
Of course, not everyone.	Elbetde, bu hemmeler däl.
It doesn't seem to be against it.	Muňa garşy däl ýaly.
It should be fast and easy.	Bu çalt we aňsat bolmaly.
She is really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy.
A lot of people did that.	Köp adam muny etdi.
I know how it can be	Men onuň nähili bolup biljekdigini bilýärin
More, maybe.	Has köp, mümkin.
I really do and it's too bad.	Men hakykatdanam edýärin we gaty erbet.
It seemed a little early for that.	Munuň üçin birneme ir ýalydy.
He has help here.	Bu ýerde oňa kömek bar.
I still don't have an answer	Mende henizem jogap ýok
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
I'm new here.	Men bu ýerde täze.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
Really good.	Aslynda gowy.
I can't do it right now	Men edil şu wagt edip bilemok
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I am good and happy.	Men gowy we bagtly.
The sun has risen.	Gün çykdy.
It has to be somewhere else at that time	Şol wagt başga bir ýerde bolmaly
Not only that.	Diňe şeýle däl.
I hope so	Şeýle bolar diýip umyt etdim
This is just one.	Bu diňe bir.
There is nothing new.	Hiç hili täze zat ýok.
I did nothing good against him	Men oňa garşy gowy zat etmedim
I have something to tell you	Men saňa bir zat aýtmaly
It told you something.	Bu size bir zadyň bardygyny aýtdy.
I heard something about it	Men bu hakda bir zat eşitdim
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
Not just you.	Diňe siz däl.
I think about you every night	Her gije sen hakda pikir edýärin
He thought he would come back.	Ol gaýdyp geler diýip pikir etdi.
It just takes time.	Diňe wagt gerek.
I had no choice	Mende başga ýol ýokdy
I thought you were happy for me	Sen meniň üçin bagtly diýip pikir etdim
Not anyone else.	Başga biri däl.
Needless to say.	Muny aýtmak hökman däldi.
He really knew how to do things.	Ol hakykatdanam zatlary nädip etmelidigini bilýärdi.
He didn't want me here.	Ol meni bu ýerde islemedi.
This makes me a little worried.	Bu bolsa meni birneme biynjalyk edýär.
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
I only know about him	Men diňe ol hakda bilýärin
He told me that.	Ol maňa muny aýtdy.
He did it well.	Ol muny gowy etdi.
I should never think of anything	Men asla hiç zat hakda pikir etmeli däl
It will be interesting.	Gyzykly bolar.
This man is not like that.	Bu adam beýle däl.
Next?	Indiki?
This is not something to do.	Bu etmeli zat däl.
That could be good.	Bu gowy bolup biler.
I got it.	Men ony aldym.
I really have to go.	Men hakykatdanam gitmeli.
I couldn't say that	Men ol zatlary aýdyp bilmedim
This is not enough at all.	Bu asla ýeterlik däl.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
No new books.	Täze kitap ýok.
This is what you want.	Bu seniň isleýän zadyň.
I can't be home today	Men bu gün öýde bolup bilemok
It's about money.	Bu pul hakda.
This book.	Bu kitap.
There is no other option.	Başga mümkinçilik ýok.
He is the only one.	Ol ýeke-täk.
It would be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolardy.
Of course there is a problem.	Elbetde bir mesele bar.
It's a weekend.	Bu dynç güni.
I only care about you	Men diňe sen hakda alada edýärin
I think he just needs a break	Meniň pikirimçe, oňa diňe dynç gerek
I thought	Men pikir etdim
Probably not.	Gerek däl bolsa gerek.
Not for what they did.	Eden zatlary üçin däl.
I knew what had happened	Näme bolandygyny bilýärdim
I didn’t want any of that	Men munuň hiç birini islemedim
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
I agreed with him and said a lot.	Men onuň bilen razy boldum we köp zat aýtdym.
Maybe this will help you too.	Belki, bu hem size kömek eder.
I was worried for a good reason.	Gowy sebäp bilen alada etdim.
I think he can be arrested.	Ony tussag edip bolar öýdýärin.
This is not interesting.	Bu gyzykly däl.
So it was really difficult for them.	Şonuň üçin olar üçin hakykatdanam kyn boldy.
The time is coming.	Wagt gelýär.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
Here you are.	Bu ýerde özüňiz bar.
So it was very interesting to me	Şonuň üçin bu meniň üçin gaty gyzykly boldy
I didn't have to say no to the answer	Jogap üçin “ýok” almaly däldim
he said.	- diýdi.
It is also very good.	Şeýle hem gaty gowy.
I think they still exist	Meniň pikirimçe, olar henizem bar
Good.	Gowy.
He couldn't be bothered.	Ol biynjalyk bolup bilmedi.
Ma'am.	Bu.
I couldn’t think of those things	Men ol zatlar hakda pikir edip bilmedim
I couldn’t love it so much	Men gaty gowy görüp bilmedim
It helped me a lot.	Maňa köp kömek etdi.
I think it will be interesting	Gyzykly bolar diýip pikir edýärin
This is indeed true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry.
They are new.	Olar täze.
You can do this completely.	Muny düýbünden edip bilersiňiz.
I have to do this alone	Muny ýeke özüm etmeli
He cares about you.	Ol siz hakda alada edýär.
I'm sorry, but so be it	Bagyşlaň, ýöne şeýle
Right now	Edil şu wagt.
I think that's enough for today	Bu gün üçin ýeterlik diýip pikir edýärin
Not really close.	Hakykatdanam ýakyn däl.
He never did it alone.	Ol hiç wagt ýeke özi etmedi.
There is only one question left.	Diňe bir sorag galdy.
You can go back to work.	Işe gaýdyp bilersiňiz.
This is just an idea.	Bu diňe bir pikir.
I could not say anything.	Men hiç zat aýdyp bilmedim.
I just can't think of anything else to do	Diňe başga bir zat etmek hakda pikir edip bilemok
I had to report it	Men oňa habar bermeli boldum
Of course I will.	Elbetde ederin.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
Nothing else is possible.	Başga hiç zat mümkin däl.
He did not answer me.	Ol maňa jogap bermedi.
He is a young man.	Ol ýigit.
I didn't want to think about it	Bu hakda pikir etmek islemedim
How to do this?	Muny nädip etmeli?
It exists now.	Ol häzir bar.
Big and fast	Uly we çalt
I have something better	Mende has gowy zat bar
Two questions please.	Iki sorag haýyş edýärin.
This was no longer possible.	Bu indi mümkin däldi.
You are always in one place.	Siz elmydama bir ýerde.
You can go back here.	Bu ýere gaýdyp bilersiňiz.
I never saw him again.	Men ony ýene görmedim.
He did nothing.	Ol hiç zat etmedi.
I hope everything is fine	Hemme zat gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
More	Has köp.
I can't sleep much	Men gaty uklap bilemok

And then.	Soň bolsa.

That man was not big.	Ol adam uly däldi.
Very human.	Gaty adam.

There seemed to be no other way.	Başga ýol ýok ýalydy.
This is not much.	Bu kän däl.

We are just human.	Biz diňe adam.

Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
I can't think of that	Men beýle pikir edip bilemok
He still couldn't get it.	Ol henizem alyp bilmedi.
I bought it today	Men şu gün satyn aldym

I couldn't take a word	Men bir söz alyp bilmedim
I think that's possible	Bu mümkin diýip pikir edýärin
Of course it was.	Elbetde, ol şeýle boldy.

There is nothing against you	Saňa garşy hiç zat ýok
Of course there is.	Elbetde bar.

They are with us.	Olar biziň bilen.
I have never tried such a big thing	Hiç haçan beýle uly zady synap görmedim

He wanted to help.	Kömek etmek isledi.

He thought he should.	Etmeli diýip pikir etdi.
Great evening	Ajaýyp agşam
I think that was a good idea at the time.	Şol wagt gowy pikir ýalydy öýdýän.
I don't think that's a good idea	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy pikir däldi

She looked really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy ýalydy.

To be there for him.	Onuň üçin şol ýerde bolmak.
He did not tell anyone about it.	Ol bu barada hiç kime aýtmady.

He did it alone.	Ol muny ýeke özi etdi.
You have to go there tomorrow	Ertir ol ýere gitmeli

Once or twice together.	Bir gezek ýa-da ikisi bilelikde.

I have had it for several years.	Mende birnäçe ýyl bäri bar.
What is this	Bu näme.
I didn't see it	Men ony görmedim
I knew he had it.	Men onuň bardygyny bilýärdim.
Things to know next.	Indiki bilmek üçin zatlar.
I'm worried about that.	Men bu barada alada edýärin.
I'm fine with that.	Men munuň bilen gowy.
That month.	Şol aý.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu hakda.
I have a problem.	Mende bir mesele bar.
Well done.	Gowy, gaty haýyş.
So new and young.	Şonuň üçin täze we ýaş.
I was nobody, so it wasn't for me	Men hiç kim däldim, şonuň üçin bu meniň üçin däldi
Of course.	Elbetde.
It's good, but it's different.	Bu gowy, ýöne başga.
What a wonderful day.	Nähili geň gün.
He wants the truth.	Hakykaty isleýär.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu biziň üçin edil şol bir ýol.
Something else is here.	Bu ýerde başga zat.
He was right.	Ol muny dogry aýtdy.
He said it was too bad.	Ol gaty erbet diýdi.
I had a lot of fun today	Bu gün gaty hezil etdim
There is something worse.	Has erbet zat bar.
There is not much for him there.	Ol ýerde onuň üçin kän zat ýok.
You can do the same.	Şeýle hem edip bilersiňiz.
I never liked him	Men oňa asla gowy görmedim
I think that's it	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şol
I just didn’t think you would need it so fast	Diňe saňa beýle çalt gerek bolar öýdemokdym
It's just a smart idea.	Bu diňe akylly pikir.
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etjekdigini bilýärdi.
This time it was good.	Bu gezek gowy boldy.
Surprisingly, he didn't call again ???.	Geň zat, ol ýene jaň etmedi ???.
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
Completely different	Doly başga
I can't do that alone	Men muny ýeke edip bilemok
I am right	Dogry edýärin
I think there is a reason for that	Munuň bir sebäbi bar diýip pikir edýärin
I didn't think about it.	Men bu barada pikir etmedim.
There is nothing wrong with you.	Ol ýerde size hiç zat ýok.
I want to know if it exists	Men onuň bardygyny bilmek isleýärin
What's the matter?	Mesele näme?
It will only happen.	Diňe bolar.
I thought you were still here	Sen henizem şu ýerde diýip pikir etdim
Something is wrong.	Bir zat dogry däl.
Not just easy.	Diňe aňsat däl.
What did he do?	Ol näme etdi?
I think it can only help	Diňe kömek edip biler diýip pikir edýärin
He didn't tell me much.	Ol maňa kän zat aýtmady.
She lives at home.	Öýde ýaşaýar.
I got it from you	Men ony senden aldym
It looks fresh and good.	Täze we gowy görünýär.
This is indeed the case	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle
Here they are now.	Ine, indi olar bar.
I had to be here	Men şu ýerde bolmaly boldum
Not there.	Ol ýerde ýok.
He apologized.	Ol ötünç sorady.
The girl came out.	Gyz çykdy.
I think you can do it well	Oňa gowy edip bilersiňiz diýip pikir edýärin
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
This is a big deal	Bu gaty uly mesele
It won't be easy and it won't be fast.	Bu aňsat bolmaz we çalt bolmaz.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
It may be possible.	Mümkin bolup biler.
I haven't seen him in years	Men ony birnäçe ýyl bäri görmedim
I still don’t fully believe that	Men henizem muňa doly ynanamok
He was left with only one thought	Diňe bir pikir bilen galdy
He was just like that.	Ol edil şonuň ýalydy.
Of course no one is going to do that.	Elbetde muny hiç kim etjek däl.
I can go one night	Bir gije gidip bilerin
Only he did not say so.	Diňe ol muny beýle aýtmady.
Of course not.	Elbetde, çynlakaý zat däl.
It really helped.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek etdi.
I'm worried about that	Men muňa uly alada edýärin
I can't say sorry	Bagyşlaň diýip biljek däl
I have to be good now.	Men häzir gowy bolmaly.
Of course big.	Elbetde uly.
He asked for help.	Ol kömek sorady.
There was something really good about it	Hakykatdanam gowy bir zat bardy
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I have already decided on this	Men muny öňem karar berdim
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
Can anyone help me?	Maňa kömek edip biljek barmy?
Not today.	Bu gün däl.
Nice to meet you	Seni görmek gaty gowy.
I've been here for a few months	Men bu ýerde birnäçe aý boldum
It can't be that way.	Beýle bolup bilmez.
It was very interesting for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gyzykly boldy.
I didn't know what could happen	Näme bolup biljekdigini bilmedim
It's fast.	Bu çalt.
He didn't have much time.	Kän wagty ýokdy.
This can be difficult.	Bu kyn bolup biler.
Who got it.	Muny kim aldy.
It looks great.	Gaty gowy görünýär.
I haven't been able to get home yet	Men entek öýe baryp bilmedim
And then a few more.	Soň bolsa ýene birnäçe.
I haven't seen it in a while	Biraz wagt bäri görmedim
I don't know why he thinks so.	Näme üçin pikir edýändigini bilenok.
There was someone.	Kimdir biri bardy.
I had no one	Mende hiç kim ýokdy
Maybe you can tell me.	Belki, maňa aýdyp bilersiňiz.
I hope he makes you happy	Ol sizi bagtly eder diýip umyt edýärin
No one wanted to answer that.	Hiç kim muňa jogap bermek islemedi.
I think we can do that	Muny edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin
It was too much for him tonight.	Bu gije onuň üçin gaty köp boldy.
He couldn't do anything for this guy.	Bu ýigit üçin hiç hili iş edip bilmedi.
Of course he will come to you.	Elbetde, ol saňa geler.
It happens every day.	Her gün şeýle bolýar.
I couldn't get enough of it	Men oňa ýeterlik bolup bilmedim
He was not at home.	Ol öýde ýokdy.
Only human beings do this.	Muny diňe adam edýär.
So there is a concern.	Şonuň üçin bir alada bar.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
He went somewhere else.	Başga ýere gitdi.
I didn't mean to offend you	Men sizi entek biynjalyk etmek islemedim
Bad thing, he was there too.	Erbet, ol hem bardy.
I did not object at the time	Men şol wagt garşy däldim
In fact, he had to leave the day before.	Aslynda ol geçen gün gitmeli boldy.
We both have.	Ikimizem bar.
That was not the case for me.	Meniň üçin bu mesele däldi.
I really enjoyed it	Mundan gaty lezzet aldym
Every day	Her gün.
I was with the police once	Men bir gezek polisiýa bilen boldum
I am myself.	Men özüm.
Good night	Gije gowy.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
I didn't think so	Men bu hakda beýle pikir etmedim
No other problem.	Başga kynçylyk ýok.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
I couldn't sleep	Men uklap bilmedim
The answer is the same.	Jogap bir hili.
Now there is.	Indi bar.
Seems like the easiest way.	Iň aňsat ýol ýaly görünýär.
I think that was enough	Meniň pikirimçe, ýeterlik boldy
I was very worried.	Men gaty alada etdim.
He makes me crazy.	Ol meni däli edýär.
I'm not anywhere.	Men hiç ýerde däl.
I could not speak	Men gürläp bilmedim
I think that is very true	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gaty dogry
I had no idea what he was doing	Men onuň näme edýändigini bilmeýärdim
I hope this works out	Munuň gowy boljakdygyna umyt edýärin
That's all there is to it.	Bu diňe şu.
Good.	Gowy.
Coming soon.	Çalt gelýär.
He thought about it himself.	Ol bu hakda özi pikir etdi.
I haven't done anything else for a long time	Köp wagt bäri başga zat etmedim
We just need time.	Bize diňe wagt gerek.
It's good to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy zat.
Not necessarily.	Hökman däl.
I did, but that was not enough.	Men etdim, ýöne bu ýeterlik däldi.
Just like him.	Edil özi ýaly.
I was worried about that.	Men bu barada alada etdim.
That's all you have to do.	Bu seniň etmeli zadyň.
A lot to come.	Geljek köp zat.
I thought about things	Men zatlar hakda pikir etdim
He was crazy.	Ol däli ýalydy.
There is something for everyone here.	Bu ýerde hemmeler üçin bir zat bar.
Not very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly däl.
I'm so scared	Men gaty gorkýaryn
I hope there will be more like this.	Munuň ýaly zatlar köp bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
It should be the same.	Şeýle hem bolmaly.
There is no news here.	Bu ýerde habar ýok.
I think that's enough for today	Bu gün üçin ýeterlik diýip pikir edýärin
The police came here.	Polisiýa bu ýere geldi.
No one else can do that.	Hiç kim muny başga ýol bilen edip bilmez.
A little while ago.	Birneme öň.
That man did.	Ol adam şeýle etdi.
I can't call her home	Men oňa öýe jaň edip bilemok
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
I didn't want to think about it.	Bu hakda pikir etmek islemedim.
He did not know.	Ol bilmeýärdi.
I will help you	Men size kömek etjek
And then he didn't.	Soň bolsa etmedi.
And then someone did.	Soň bolsa biri etdi.
I can't be like that anymore	Men indi beýle bolup bilemok
I am here	Men şu ýerde
There. 	Ol ýerde. 
Ma'am.	Bu.
Time can't get worse.	Wagt has erbet bolup bilmez.
This is difficult for him.	Bu onuň üçin kyn.
I can never see that	Men muny hiç haçan görüp bilemok
This is so stupid.	Bu gaty samsyk.
You have to go	Sen gitmeli
They are in one place.	Olar bir ýerde.
You are here for him.	Sen onuň üçin şu ýerde.
This is really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gyzykly.
Maybe not today.	Belki şu gün däl.
Maybe no one is there.	Belki ol ýerde hiç kim ýok.
Someone to get something.	Kimdir biri zat almak üçin.
I know that's not what I'm trying to do	Etjek bolýan zadyň däldigini bilýärin
Of course, it's very difficult now.	Elbetde, häzir gaty kyn.
I don't like anything very easy.	Men gaty aňsat zady halamok.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
I have done this many times.	Men muny köp gezek etdim.
I had to go far, far away	Uzak, uzak gitmeli boldum
This guy is so bad.	Bu ýigit gaty erbet.
It is also very beautiful.	Şeýle hem gaty ajaýyp.
Is there another way?	Başga ýol barmy?
It wasn't like you.	Bu seniň ýaly däldi.
It's time.	Wagt boldy.
I want to go with you	Men seniň bilen gitmek isleýärin
I gave him everything	Men oňa hemme zady berdim
I can't give a reason for that.	Munuň üçin bir sebäp berip bilemok.
We are there again.	Biz ýene şol ýerde.
I already know how to do it.	Muny nädip etmelidigini eýýäm bilýärin.
It wasn't too bad.	Bu gaty erbet däldi.
I do not agree with that	Men muňa razy däl
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I thought a lot	Men köp pikir etdim
I'm not going to do that.	Muny etjek däl.
He could do nothing.	Ol hiç zat edip bilmedi.
What a new idea.	Nähili täze pikir.
It will be.	Ol bolar.
I hope one day I will be like her	Bir gün onuň ýaly bolaryn diýip umyt edýärin
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
There is no other good word for it.	Munuň üçin başga gowy söz ýok.
He will do the same again next year.	Geljek ýyl ýene şeýle eder.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I never like it, I don't like it	Hiç haçan halamok, halamok
I can't see anything	Men hiç zady görüp bilemok
Maybe not.	Belki beýle däldi.
There are several good reasons.	Birnäçe gowy sebäp bar.
This made him anxious.	Bu ony biynjalyk etdi.
I called immediately.	Men derrew jaň etdim.
No help.	Kömek ýok.
I'm not for that money	Men bu pul üçin däl
I called three times	Üç gezek jaň etdim
He said he could do it.	Ol bu işi edip biljekdigini aýtdy.
It’s hard to know what actually happened.	Aslynda näme bolandygyny bilmek kyn.
There	Şol ýerde.
She looks great and knows it.	Ajaýyp görünýär we muny bilýär.
I decided on the latter.	Soňky barada karar berdim.
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men oňa hiç zat etmeli däldigini aýtdym
He could do nothing.	Ol hiç zat edip bilmedi.
I can do it right.	Dogry edip bilerin.
Ma'am.	Bu.
I don’t know why he does that, but it seemed right.	Näme üçin beýle edýändigini bilenok, ýöne dogry ýalydy.
It was very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly boldy.
It takes a while for everyone.	Her kim üçin biraz wagt gerek.
And time.	We wagt.
This is very new.	Bu gaty täze.
I had no idea what he was doing	Men onuň näme edýändigini bilmeýärdim
Now he understands.	Indi düşündi.
I think they still exist	Meniň pikirimçe, olar henizem bar
I can help you with something.	Men size bir zat bilen kömek edip bilerin.
Good guy	Gowy ýigit
I'll be early	Men ir bolaryn
Maybe that's a good thing.	Belki, bu gowy zat.
This is last week.	Bu geçen hepde.
Then it came to me.	Soň maňa geldi.
I didn’t care for anything	Men hiç zat üçin alada etmedim
This was not possible	Bu mümkin däldi
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
Now the question is, is that so?	Indi sorag, şeýlemi?
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
This idea is not new.	Bu pikir täze däl.
In fact.	Aslynda.
Once, twice, then again.	Bir gezek, iki gezek, soň ýene.

He's smart, you know that.	Ol akylly, muny bilýärsiň.
He doesn't have to do that.	Ol muny etmeli däl.
I can see.	Men görüp bilýärin.
I don't need anyone	Maňa hiç kim gerek däl
I can't be the only one I know	Men bilýän ýekeje adam bolup bilemok
That's right.	Dogry.
Going somewhere else.	Başga bir ýere gitmek.
This is not true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry däl.
Okay, that's a lie.	Bolýar, bu ýalan.
This may have been two years ago.	Bu, belki, iki ýyl ozal bolup biler.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
He will come.	Geler.
He took it.	Ol alyp gitdi.
You will have to worry about that.	Munuň üçin alada etmeli bolarsyňyz.
I really want to be that	Men hakykatdanam şol bolmak isleýärin
No one told me that.	Hiç kim muny maňa aýtmady.
There was no need to answer it either	Oňa jogap bermek hem zerur däldi
There was no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýokdy.
That it can only happen.	Munuň diňe özi bolup biljekdigini.
Good and easy.	Gowy we aňsat.
He wanted to do it.	Ol muny etjek boldy.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe bir zat.
It can't be like that.	Munuň ýaly bolup bilmez.
I made the right decision.	Dogry karar berdim.
The same is true for me.	Bu meniň üçin hem edil şonuň ýaly.
It's a lot of fun.	Bu gaty hezil.
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
This is exactly what we need.	Bu edil bize gerek zat.
No questions asked.	Sorag ýok.
It was too much.	Gaty köp boldy.
If he could sleep, he could sleep.	Uklap bilýän bolsa, uklap bilýärdi.
The adult could not get it	Uly adam alyp bilmedi
The reason for this must be clear.	Munuň sebäbi aýdyň bolmaly.
You need to rest a little	Biraz dynç almaly
I really had to stop doing that	Men hakykatdanam muny etmegi bes etmeli boldum
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
I can't do that myself	Muny özüm edip bilemok
Not last night.	Düýn gije däl.
I think everything will be back soon.	Hemme zat çalt gaýdyp geler diýip pikir edýärin.
I'm sorry now.	Men häzir gynanýaryn.
This is good news.	Bu gowy habar.
I can't do that anymore	Men muny indi edip bilemok
I think it would be very interesting.	Meniň pikirimçe, gaty gyzykly zat bolardy.
I had such a wonderful response.	Mende şeýle ajaýyp jogap boldy.
Good, very bad.	Gowy, gaty erbet.
I don't know yet	Men entek bilemok
It was not a good day.	Bu gowy gün däldi.
I can do it elsewhere.	Başga bir ýerde edip bilerin.
Two weeks, maybe.	Iki hepde, belki.
I still believe that	Men henizem muňa ynanýaryn
I took the floor last night	Düýn agşam söz aldym
Good.	Gowy.
It sounded good.	Gowy ses aldy.
Do it now	Indi et.
There was no sun.	Gün ýokdy.
It's a sound.	Bu ses.
It really helped me.	Bu maňa hakykatdanam kömek etdi.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
I know what can and will happen	Näme bolup biljekdigini we mümkin boljakdygyny bilýärin
I think everyone did well tonight	Bu gije hemmeler gowy etdi diýip pikir edýärin
Someone who can decide.	Karar berip biljek biri.
It was not like that.	Bu onuň ýaly däldi.
He got it.	Ol aldy.
I can't think.	Men pikir edip bilemok.
I often think about it	Men köplenç ol hakda pikir edýärin
No one wants to talk about it.	Hiç kim bu hakda gürleşmek islemeýär.
He left for me.	Ol meniň üçin gitdi.
I can even buy it myself	Hatda özüm satyn alyp bilerin
Mon.	Sen.
I just need it this week	Maňa diňe şu hepde gerek
You have to do something this time	Bu gezek bir zat etmeli
I'm not busy	Men meşgul däl
This is no longer possible.	Indi bu mümkin däl.
Not beautiful, of course.	Elbetde owadan däl.
I could not tell.	Men aýdyp bilmedim.
You know about me.	Sen meniň hakda bilýärsiň.
What could be the reason?	Munuň sebäbi näme bolup biler.
I can even help you	Hatda size kömek edip bilerin
This seems right to me.	Bu maňa dogry ýaly.
Same thing.	Edil şol bir zat.
I can't think of anything else	Başga zat hakda pikir edip bilemok
I know, I really do.	Bilýän, hakykatdanam edýärin.
He said, of course, something new.	Ol, elbetde, täze zat diýdi.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, şeýle boldy.
Just a word, nothing else.	Diňe söz, başga hiç zat ýok.
He can only do one or the other.	Ol diňe birini ýa-da başga birini edip biler.
Here's how.	Ine, nähili.
It seemed so good.	Gaty gowy ýalydy.
I didn't know anything better	Men has gowy zat bilmeýärdim
There is something new.	Täze bir zat bar.
In fact, they were.	Aslynda olar bardy.
I didn't know that.	Men muny bilmeýärdim.
Not every day.	Her gün däl.
He objected.	Ol garşy çykdy.
I know there is more to it	Munuň üçin has köp zadyň bardygyny bilýärin
I just want one, but I can't get it	Men diňe birini isleýärin, ýöne ony alyp bilemok
I'll be fine	Men özüm gowy bolaryn
He told me that.	Maňa muny aýtdy.
I know what he wants to do	Men onuň näme etmek isleýändigini bilýärin
It's so easy.	Munuň ýaly aňsat.
It was a good evening.	Gowy agşam boldy.
That may be enough.	Bu ýeterlik bolup biler.
There is something for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin bir zat bar.
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
I saw what it would be like	Munuň nähili boljakdygyny gördüm
This will really help.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek eder.
In fact, not at all.	Aslynda asla diýen ýaly däl.
You always have to tell the truth	Elmydama hakykaty aýtmaly
I think this is it.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu.
I'm sure it will work out	Gowy iş etjekdigine ynanýaryn
This is good news.	Bu gowy habar.
What an interesting word.	Nähili gyzykly söz.
Say it right.	Dogry aýdyň.
He had something to do.	Onuň etmeli zatlary bardy.
The mind is not beautiful, it is not very intelligent.	Akylly owadan däl, gaty akylly däl.
I am a bad person	Men erbet adam
I got it once and it took me an hour.	Bir gezek aldym, maňa bir sagat gerek boldy.
It was very difficult to decide.	Karar bermek gaty kyn boldy.
Why not take some time to enjoy?	Näme üçin lezzet almak üçin biraz wagt gerek däl?
Not interesting.	Gyzykly däl.
I didn't mean to offend you	Men sizi biynjalyk etmek islemedim
Everything will be clear next week.	Geljek hepde hemme zat aýdyň bolar.
More than that.	Has köp zat.
I told her what had happened	Men oňa näme bolandygyny aýtdym
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
You are absolutely	Siz düýbünden.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
I just want to allow it.	Men oňa diňe rugsat bermek isleýärin.
I need you so much to give me a hard day.	Maňa kyn gün bermek üçin maňa gaty mätäç.
He was almost there.	Ol diýen ýalydy.
Then a long way home.	Soň bolsa öýe uzak ýol.
I knew something bad was going to happen this morning	Şu gün irden erbet bir zadyň boljakdygyny bilýärdim
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
In fact, there is such a thing	Aslynda munuň ýaly mesele bar
He didn't tell us anything else.	Ol bize başga zat aýtmady.
Probably a long time.	Uzak wagt gerek bolsa gerek.
One morning he left.	Bir gün ir gitdi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
There is nothing easy about it.	Bu hakda aňsat zat ýok.
Of course he can't see.	Elbetde, görüp bilmeýär.
It's great to be able to do that.	Muny edip bilmek gaty gowy zat.
I did that last night	Men muny düýn agşam etdim
You have a great time.	Siz gaty uly wagt.
I don't know how that happened	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilemok
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
This is not good news.	Bu gowy habar däl.
This is a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý mesele.
I can't help it, it's too bad.	Men oňa kömek edip bilemok, ol gaty erbet.
I was busy there	Men ol ýerde meşgul boldum
One day, that night.	Bir gün, şol gije.
In fact, this is a lie.	Aslynda bu ýalan.
He had to go.	Ol gitmeli boldy.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
It just looks so good.	Diňe gaty gowy görünýär.
His departure seemed imminent	Onuň gitmegi ýakyn ýalydy
I don't think so	Men beýle pikir etmeýärin
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Muny etmek ähtimal.
This is very interesting to me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gyzykly.
I can't answer at all	Men asla jogap berip bilemok
I had no choice.	Mende başga ýol ýokdy.
He has to go far.	Ol uzak gitmeli.
He is right.	Ol bu barada dogry aýdýar.
I had no reason.	Mende hiç hili sebäp ýokdy.
In fact, I couldn't be happier	Aslynda has bagtly bolup bilmedim
This time	Bu wagt
Why? 	Näme üçin?
Maybe you should go home	Belki, öýe gitmeli
I don't do much here.	Men bu ýerde kän bir iş etmeýärin.
Which would be great.	Haýsy ajaýyp bolardy.
Crazy there.	Ol ýerde däli.
he thought.	diýip pikir etdi.
Full advice is always the best way	Doly maslahat elmydama iň gowy ýol
I couldn't see how it was	Onuň nähili bolandygyny görüp bilmedim
It will not be better here.	Bu ýerde has gowy bolmaz.
He can do whatever he wants.	Islän zadyny edip biler.
I was never like that before	Men ozal beýle däldim
He wanted to tell her everything.	Oňa hemme zady aýtmak isledi.
There is no one just for us.	Diňe biziň üçin hiç kim ýok.
For the first time for him.	Onuň üçin ilkinji gezek.
He did so.	Şeýle etdi.
Everything that can happen	Bolup biljek her bir iş
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I was very worried about that	Men bu barada gaty biynjalyk boldum
You have to do the same.	Şeýle hem etmeli.
I didn't call him.	Men oňa jaň etmedim.
I think this helps him.	Bu oňa kömek edýär diýip pikir edýärin.
He is nothing to me.	Ol meniň üçin hiç zat däl.
I can't see it.	Ony görüp bilemok.
Now he is back.	Indi gaýdyp gelýär.
Then I offered myself	Soň özümi teklip etdim
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat.
This was not surprising.	Bu geň däldi.
There was hope.	Umyt bardy.
I hope it never happens	Hiç haçan bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
I really believe that	Men muňa hakykatdanam ynanýaryn
It will be.	Bu bolar.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
That was a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir boldy.
You are amazed.	Siz haýran.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I have to be happy.	Men bagtly bolmaly.
There was no problem.	Kynçylyk ýokdy.
I think that would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
I think it helped a lot	Bu köp kömek etdi diýip pikir edýärin
He is a really good man.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy adam.
I still know.	Men henizem bilýärin.
I am not.	Men däl.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
Maybe you should go	Belki gitmeli
We are not against it.	Biz muňa garşy däl.
I did a good job with that	Bu bilen gowy iş etdim
I could relax.	Men dynç alyp bilýärdim.
There must be one.	Biri bolmaly.
It should be the same.	Şeýle hem bolmaly.
I had no idea it was like that	Men onuň beýle bolandygyny bilmeýärdim
I thought it would be time	Wagt bolar diýip pikir etdim
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
Who and what is this.	Bu kim we näme.
It looks great, of course.	Elbetde ajaýyp görünýär.
You can do the same.	Şeýle hem edip bilersiňiz.
Nothing was wrong.	Hiç hili zat dogry däldi.
In fact, there are many.	Aslynda gaty köp.
Just one thing.	Diňe bir zat.
I had never thought of that before	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim
It can't be different.	Başga bolup bilmez.
I want to be right	Dogry etmek isleýärin
He said he did not know.	Bilmeýändigini aýtdy.
I have to go to call	Men jaň etmek üçin gitmeli
This was not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Dogry etmeli zat.
She was like a good girl.	Gowy gyz ýalydy.
Apparently.	Görünýär.
Of course, this is not possible for everyone.	Elbetde, bu hemme zat üçin mümkin däl.
I had to do that before	Men muny öňem etmeli boldum
This man.	Bu adam.
This person is very good	Bu adam gaty gowy
I just have to go somewhere else	Men diňe başga ýere gitmeli
Same thing next time.	Indiki gezek şol bir zat.
It was never bad.	Hiç haçan erbet däldi.
I think she would be beautiful	Meniň pikirimçe, ol owadan bolardy
I can't let that happen	Men muny etmäge rugsat berip bilemok
You know, really hard.	Bilýärsiň, gaty kyn.
I can't call	Men jaň edip bilemok
You have to go	Sen gitmeli
I didn't see him today	Men ony şu gün görmedim
I had to give it to him	Men oňa bermeli boldum
I saw you last night	Düýn gije seni gördüm
We are now.	Biz häzir.
I agree.	Men razy.
He could only hope.	Ol diňe umyt edip bilýärdi.
I only got one	Men diňe birini aldym
It was not.	Beýle däldi.
Not good at all.	Hiç haçan gowy däl.
I never wanted that.	Men muny hiç haçan islemedim.
You will have what you want	Seniň isleýän zadyň bolar
I did not know	Men bilmedim
Well, someone else said.	Gowy, başga biri aýtdy.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
I promised you	Men size söz berdim
And you are for me.	Sen bolsa meniň üçin sen.
I just want to be with you	Men diňe siziň bilen bolmak isleýärin
I should never have said that	Men muny hiç haçan aýtmaly däldim
He knows it and he doesn't know it.	Ol muny bilýär we bilmeýär.
I want to be with you longer	Men siziň bilen has uzak bile bolmak isleýärin
I just had an idea	Men diňe bir pikir aýtdym
He didn't need anyone else.	Oňa başga bir adam gerek däldi.
You are not	Sen beýle däl.
It's not for you, it's not for you.	Bu seniň üçin däl, hakykatdanam beýle däl.
Go and do something.	Bar, bir zatlar et.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
And then you have to go.	Soň bolsa gitmeli.
In fact, no one is serious	Aslynda hiç kim çynlakaý däl
Only very good.	Diňe gaty gowy.
He gave me everything.	Maňa hemme zady berdi.
This is not easy, of course.	Bu aňsat däl, elbetde.
I thought about it a lot	Men ol hakda köp pikir etdim
I didn't want to see him	Men ony görmek islemedim
I'm not ready for that yet	Men entek muňa taýyn däl
How are they.	Olar nähili.
She had to help me.	Ol maňa kömek etmeli boldy.
It's very difficult to call.	Bu jaň etmek gaty kyn.
More	Has köp.
This is a very serious matter.	Bu gaty çynlakaý mesele hakda.
I seem strange	Men geň zat ýaly
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
I didn't know what happened to me	Mende näme bolandygyny bilmedim
In fact, it is not.	Aslynda beýle bolmaz.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda muny etmek bilen çynlakaý bir pikir edip bolar.
Of course not.	Elbetde, ýok.
I never thought it would happen	Munuň boljakdygyny asla pikir etmedim
This is not just a day.	Bu diňe bir gün däl.
He agreed to do the same.	Ol hem muny etmäge razy boldy.
That's all he needs.	Bu oňa zerur zat.
That's fine with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy.
Do something for a person	Adam üçin bir zat et
He was just like a happy guy.	Ol edil bagtly ýigit ýalydy.
I'm very worried about that	Men bu barada gaty alada edýärin
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
I just didn’t want to talk	Diňe gürleşmek islemedim
I had to call immediately	Men derrew jaň etmeli boldum
Then the police called.	Soň polisiýa jaň etdi.
I didn't have to do that to him.	Men oňa muny etmeli däldim.
He could not see much.	Ol köp zady görüp bilmedi.
Many people.	Köp adam.
We have to go	Biz gitmeli
Not really.	Hakykatdanam däl.
As before.	Öňküsi ýaly.

This was no longer possible.	Indi bu mümkin däldi.
He was not alone here.	Bu ýerde ol ýeke däldi.

This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
This may still be the case.	Bu henizem bolup biler.
It is also not necessary.	Şeýle hem zerur däl.
Then another, then another, then another.	Soň başga, soň başga, soň başga.
The girl is very young.	Gyz gaty ýaş.
He didn't tell us anything else.	Ol bize başga zat aýtmady.
Not happy.	Bagtly däl.
You are very young.	Siz düýbünden ýaş.
There were several others.	Başga birnäçe adam bardy.
For the first time ever	Hemme zat üçin ilkinji gezek
If it was difficult, he could not say.	Bu kyn bolsa, aýdyp bilmedi.
I really don't know	Hakykatdanam bilemok
Of course you have to go.	Elbetde gitmeli.
A book told me this once	Bir kitap maňa muny bir gezek aýtdy
Someone today.	Bu gün kimdir biri.
I just wasn’t good at it at the time.	Diňe şol wagt hiç hili gowy däldim.
This is one.	Bu bir.
Such an interesting book.	Şeýle gyzykly kitap.
Of course I said no.	Elbetde beýle däldigini aýtdym.
Maybe?	Mümkin?
I tried to do the right thing	Dogry etjek boldum
I said at the time.	Men şol wagt aýtdym.
I couldn't see it.	Men ony görüp bilmedim.
There is a lot going on right now	Häzirki wagtda köp zat bolup biler
We can't get anything else.	Başga zat alyp bilmeris.
I was very fast	Men gaty çalt boldum
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
I don't know anything about him	Men ol hakda hiç zat bilemok
Then I asked him a question	Soň men oňa bir sorag berdim
No words at all.	Asla söz ýok.
I haven't thought much about it yet	Men entek bu hakda kän pikir etmedim
I didn't care about anything else	Başga zat hakda alada etmedim
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I'm talking about me now.	Men häzir men hakda.
It's too early.	Bu entek ir.
I don't think it was easy	Meniň pikirimçe, bu aňsat däldi
I thought it might be good	Gowy bolup biler öýdüpdim
Everything is right.	Hemme zat dogry.
This seems very strange.	Bu gaty geň görünýär.
It took time.	Bu wagt aldy.
I couldn't get it	Men muny alyp bilmedim
Then it was very strange.	Soň gaty geň boldy.
I think that's right	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry zat
Then do it again.	Soň bolsa ýene bir gezek et.
He says whatever he wants.	Islän zadyny aýdýar.
He is crazy about you.	Ol sen hakda däli.
I hope this happens soon.	Bu çalt bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
I haven't told you before	Men saňa öňem aýdyp bilmedim
Even someone came back.	Hatda biri gaýdyp geldi.
I didn't want to hope.	Umyt etmek islemedim.
I have to go now	Men indi gitmeli
It can't hurt a bit	Biraz zyýan berip bilmez
Interesting for me.	Meniň üçin gyzykly.
I saw him, he was with someone	Men ony gördüm, ol kimdir biri bilen boldy
There is a problem here	Bu ýerde bir mesele bar
You and I, what are we.	Sen we men, biz näme.
They weren't going to do it.	Olar muny etjek däldi.
It was just for him.	Bu diňe onuň üçin boldy.
A lot of things happen	Köp zatlar bolýar
It also seems smart.	Bu hem akylly ýaly.
It took several hours.	Birnäçe sagat gerek boldy.
It has been around for two years.	Iki ýyl bäri bar.
I want to marry a girl	Gyz almak isleýärin
I don't know what to try.	Näme synap görüp biljekdigini bilemok.
He didn't really say much.	Ol hakykatdanam kän bir zat aýtmady.
This is likely.	Bu, ähtimal.
I am very impressed	Mende gaty haýran
Then a few more people came.	Soň ýene birnäçe adam geldi.
He wanted to.	Ol isledi.
Too big.	Gaty uly.
I think about it	Bu hakda pikir edýärin
I'm afraid to do worse in order to do better.	Has gowy etjek bolup has erbet etmekden gorkýaryn.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe şeýle etmeli.
I find myself very happy and happy	Özümi gaty bagtly we begenýärin
I can't be that person	Men ol adam bolup bilemok
I want to tell him that it was good	Oňa gowy bolandygyny aýtmak isleýärin
I was never like that	Men hiç wagt beýle däldim
I want to be her.	Men onuň bolmak isleýärin.
That's it.	Ine, şol.

Almost anything you want.	Islän zady diýen ýaly.
I thought it might help you	Size kömek edip biler öýdüpdim
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
I shouldn’t have been so stupid	Men beýle samsyk bolmaly däldim
This guy will do the same.	Bu ýigit hem şeýle eder.
I know it exists	Men onuň bardygyny bilýärin
Maybe three times.	Belki üç gezek.
I was already worried.	Men eýýäm alada etdim.
Just like you	Siz ýaly.
Had to get a little.	Biraz almaly boldy.
He doesn't like it.	Ol muny halamaýar.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
I never needed it.	Maňa hiç wagt gerek däldi.
Everything would be bad.	Hemme zat erbet bolardy.
I have a very good watch.	Mende gaty gowy sagat bar.
I was happy	Men bagtly boldum
Not so.	Beýle däl.
Maybe not.	Belki ýok.
They are completely false	Olar düýbünden ýalan
There is no one but me.	Menden başga hiç kim ýok.
What is this	Bu näme.
Do the following.	Indiki zatlary et.
I just want to talk to you.	Men diňe siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
I have never been able to buy one	Men hiç haçan satyn alyp bilmedim
I saw everything.	Men hemme zady gördüm.
It's like a book.	Bu edil kitap ýaly.
This is another question.	Bu başga sorag.
It looks great with everything.	Hemme zat bilen ajaýyp görünýär.
They do not exist at the moment.	Olar häzirki wagtda ýok.

I should never have told you that	Men bu hakda size hiç haçan aýtmaly däldim

Where is the next one.	Indiki nirede.
I can do better	Men has gowy edip bilerin
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
No one wanted to know	Hiç kim bilmek islemedi
I didn't see him do that.	Men onuň muny edenini görmedim.
I have nothing to do	Meniň etjek zadym ýok
You are beautiful, young man.	Sen ajaýyp, ýigit.
Okay.	Bolýar.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
I'm not as young as they used to be	Men olar ýaly ýaş däl
I had fun there	Men ol ýerde hezil etdim
Any last person who can do that.	Muny edip biljek her soňky adam.
I think they are right.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar dogry.
So there was no mistake.	Şonuň üçin ýalňyşlyk ýokdy.
I want it as bad as yours	Muny seniň ýaly erbet isleýärin
For several years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
I hope dinner time is close	Nahar wagty ýakyn bolup biler diýip umyt edýärin
I couldn't stop thinking about him	Men ol hakda pikir etmegi bes edip bilmedim
I didn't see it that way	Men ony beýle görmedim
You have to do it now.	Şu wagt etmeli.
Of course there is no sound.	Elbetde ses ýok.
It will be at home tomorrow.	Ertir öýde bolar.
I can't do anything else	Başga zat edip bilemok
I know very well what he did	Onuň edenini gowy bilýärin
I'd like to see it.	Men ony görmek isleýärin.
I never thought it would happen	Munuň boljakdygyny asla pikir etmedim
I thought it was impossible	Mümkin däl diýip pikir etdim
I was the only one here	Men bu ýerde ýeke özüm boldum
I didn't care about anything.	Hiç zat hakda alada etmedim.
I hope you can do something about it.	Munuň bilen bir zatlar edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt edýärin.
It bothered me a lot.	Bu meni gaty erbet biynjalyk etdi.
I think it's good and bad.	Gowy we erbet zat diýip pikir edýärin.
Of course it is.	Elbetde şeýle.

Very good.	Gaty gowy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Indi şeýle boldy.
It was good with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy boldy.
I haven't tried anything like that.	Şeýle bir zady synap görmedim.
Not too fast.	Gaty çalt däl.
About the possibility.	Mümkinçilik hakda.
Someone will be there for you.	Biri siziň üçin bolar.
He has done this several times.	Ol muny birnäçe gezek etdi.
He came back to me.	Ol maňa gaýdyp geldi.
Definitely a challenge, but not impossible.	Elbetde kynçylyk, ýöne mümkin däl.
Seeing someone might have happened to him.	Kimdir birini görmek onuň üçin bolup geçen bolmagy mümkin.
I have a lot	Mende köp zat bar
I hope so.	Umyt edýärin.
Really weird.	Hakykatdanam gaty geň.
So I think about it.	Şonuň üçin bu barada pikir edýärin.

That fact must be taken into account. "	Munuň özi hem bar.
I want something else	Başga bir zat isleýärin
Maybe like you.	Mümkin seniň ýaly.

That's the way it is today.	Häzirki wagtda şeýle boldy.
Not a problem.	Mesele däl.
I think this is with me too.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hem meniň bilen.
I have good news	Mende gowy habar bar
You have to sing bad.	Erbet aýdym aýtmaly.
I didn’t care about being with someone	Men kimdir biri bilen bolmak hakda alada etmedim
He went out here once.	Ol bu ýere bir gezek çykdy.
Here is the answer.	Ine jogap.
Of course he did.	Elbetde, pikir etdi.
It was kind of fun.	Bu bir hili hezil boldy.
The problem is here.	Mesele şu ýerde.
I had to take it alone	Men ony ýeke almaly boldum
Nor was it.	Şeýle hem däldi.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
It will not be so.	Şeýle bolmaz.
I can't say what happened.	Näme bolandygyny aýdyp biljek däl.
New book.	Täze kitap.
He can't do that.	Ol muny edip bilmeýär.
I told her I could do it better.	Ony nädip has gowy edip biljekdigini aýtdym.
He is with us every day.	Ol her gün biziň bilen bolýar.
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
I always do that	Men muny elmydama edýärin
Always visible.	Elmydama görünýär.
It should be good.	Gowy bolmaly.
Bar.	Bar.
I can't think of anything to do.	Etjek zadym hakda pikir edip bilemok.
He could not call her.	Oňa jaň edip bilmedi.
I had to do it	Men muny etmeli boldum
He was not against it at all.	Ol asla garşy däldi.
It was a lot of fun today.	Bu gün gaty gyzykly boldy.
Everything is possible !.	Hemme zat mümkin!.
It is also very beautiful.	Şeýle hem gaty ajaýyp.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy zat bolardy.
This is the future.	Bu geljek.
I think he decided to leave that day	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şol gün ir gitmek kararyna geldi
Neither I nor I	Men ikimizem, ikimizem däldim
I can love it a little bit	Men ony birneme gowy görüp bilýärin
I know what to do with her	Men onuň bilen näme etmelidigimi bilýärin
Time eliminates many problems.	Wagt köp meseläni ýok edýär.
This will be a big challenge.	Bu uly kynçylyk bolar.
he asked.	' diýip sorady.
He gave her no chance.	Ol özüne hiç hili mümkinçilik bermedi.
It took us a long time.	Bu bize köp wagt aldy.
She must be a girl.	Ol gyz bolmaly.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde bize zyýan berip biljek zat ýok.
She wanted to tell him.	Ol oňa aýtmak isledi.
He said he had to go, he had to go.	Ol gitmeli, gitmeli diýdi.

I think it will be all right now	Meniň pikirimçe, ol häzir hemme zat bolar
Everyone looks great.	Her kim gaty gowy görünýär.
What a wonderful response time.	Haýsy ajaýyp jogap wagty.
I don't know anyone who knows that.	Muny bilýän birini bilemok.
I can't see what's going to happen next	Indiki näme boljakdygyny görüp bilemok
He didn't actually do it, and it was a little difficult.	Aslynda muny etmedi we bu birneme kyn boldy.
One day gone.	Bir gün gitdi.
Good for me.	Meniň üçin gowy.
I didn't do anything wrong	Erbet zat etmedim
I never did that, but he took me away	Men muny hiç haçan etmedim, ýöne ol meni alyp gitdi
It can't be bad.	Erbet bolup bilmez.
He told me yesterday.	Ol düýn maňa aýtdy.
It takes an hour.	Bir sagat gerek.
There was another reason for this.	Munuň başga bir sebäbi bardy.
I think someone knows	Kimdir biri bilýär öýdýän
I think life is really great	Durmuş hakykatdanam ajaýyp diýip pikir edýärin
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
I'm really happy for her.	Men onuň üçin hakykatdanam bagtly.

This is life.	Bu durmuş.

I'm just like anyone else.	Men häzir başga adam ýaly.
He offered her.	Oňa teklip etdi.
At that time, everything was different.	Şol wagt hemme zat başga.
No one was ready for that.	Munuň üçin hiç kim taýyn däldi.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy boldy.
I thought it must be the reason	Munuň sebäbi bolmaly diýip pikir etdim
He could be that person again.	Ol ýene şol adam bolup biler.
Of course, this is good.	Elbetde, bu gowy.
At that time.	Şol wagt.
.	.
We don't need that idea.	Bize beýle pikir gerek däl.
I can't go there with you	Men seniň bilen ol ýere gidip bilemok
That's what happened to me.	Meniň üçin bu şeýle boldy.
I know it exists.	Men onuň bardygyny bilýärin.
I had no other words	Mende başga söz ýokdy

Now it's time for him.	Indi onuň üçin wagt geldi.
I don’t think it was necessary to say that	Meniň pikirimçe, muny aýtmak hökman däldi
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He is not a good man.	Ol gowy adam däl.
I bought it.	Men satyn aldym.
Many people came there.	Ol ýere köp adam geldi.
I'll call the police	Men polisiýa jaň ederin
I need a home at short notice	Maňa gysga wagtda öýde gerek
And then a little more.	Soň bolsa ýene birneme.
I'm fine with that	Men munuň bilen gowy boldum
I think that's the problem.	Bu mesele diýip pikir edýärin.
This is not really new.	Bu hakykatdanam täze däl.
It could have been better.	Has gowy edip bolardy.
Good because he had a lot.	Gowy, sebäbi onuň köp zady bardy.
I've never done that before	Men muny ozal etmedim
I can't see it very well	Men muny gaty görüp bilemok
I knew it wasn't going to happen	Men munuň etmejekdigini bilýärdim
This is bad for business.	Bu iş üçin erbet.
I think this is the only way	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýeke-täk ýol
He was well aware of this.	Ol muny gowy bilýärdi.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
A lot of people did that.	Köp adam muny etdi.
I can't go home anymore	Men indi öýe gaýdyp bilemok
There is not much I can do about it.	Bu hakda edip biljek zadym kän däl.
It's me again.	Bu ýene men.
Everything will be fine for you here.	Bu ýerde hemme zat siziň üçin gowy bolar.
I saw no other way.	Başga ýol görmedim.
That day	Şol gün.
There are other things.	Başga zatlar hem bar.
He said it was good.	Ol gowy diýdi.
I'm not against it.	Men muňa garşy däl.
I really need to do something about it.	Men hakykatdanam bu barada bir zat etmeli.
There are good things.	Gowy zatlar bar.
I really need it	Maňa gaty gerek
Now there are two.	Indi ikisi bar.
I told you it wasn't.	Saňa aýtdym, ol däldi.
Just like now	Edil häzirki ýaly.
This is very possible.	Bu gaty mümkin.
I am nothing and everything	Men hiç zat we hemme zat däl
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
Long.	Uzak.
We are happy.	Biz bagtly.
I agree	Men razy bolaryn
Not complete at all.	Asla doly däl.
He was there to do it.	Ol bu işi etmek üçin bardy.
He was also a little surprised to see me.	Ol hem meni görüp birneme geň galdy.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
There is a problem.	Mesele bar.
I knew the truth	Men hakykaty bilýärdim
I immediately thought of you.	Men derrew sen hakda pikir etdim.
He could not do that.	Muny edip bilmedi.
It takes twice as long.	Munuň üçin iki gezek gerek.
I had never thought of that before.	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim.
She is not at home.	Ol öýde däl.
I thought about myself	Özüm hakda pikir etdim
I wonder where this could be	Munuň nirede bolup biljekdigine haýran
Good.	Gowy.
You have something to do for me	Meniň üçin seniň etmeli zadyň bar
I have to tell him one day.	Oňa bir gün aýtmaly.
He was very good to me.	Ol maňa gaty gowy boldy.
This is not a good advice.	Bu beýle gowy maslahat däl.
Now he is back.	Indi ol gaýdyp geldi.
Talking about it is not about saying something new.	Bu hakda aýtmak, täze zat aýtmak däl.
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
I loved it	Men muňa gaty gowy gördüm
This is difficult for him.	Bu onuň üçin kyn.
I think this will be a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
I am gone	Men ýok boldum
I had to do something better for myself	Özüm üçin has gowy zady etmeli boldum
He never wanted it.	Ol hiç wagt ony islemedi.
We can't help it.	Biz oňa kömek edip bilmeris.
This is nothing.	Bu hiç hili zat däl.
That's a lot.	Bu köp boldy.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
This is a big decision.	Bu uly karar.
It looks interesting!	Bu gyzykly görünýär !.
Oh no, he wasn't.	Aý ýok, ol beýle däldi.
It took a long time.	Bu gaty köp wagt aldy.
There would always be a lot to do.	Elmydama etmeli köp zat bolardy.
The best life.	Iň gowy durmuş.
There was no problem.	Hiç hili kynçylyk ýokdy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
He knows what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini biler.
I had to go every day	Her gün gitmeli boldum
Indeed, it is.	Hakykatdanam, şeýle.
It's too fast.	Ol gaty çalt.
I was not good for anything	Men hiç zat üçin gowy däldim
What did he do?	Ol näme etdi.
I think there is one tomorrow morning	Ertir irden biri bar öýdýän
Not for him.	Onuň üçin däl.
I knew it, and he knew it	Men muny bilýärdim we ol hem bilýärdi
I only knew two things	Men diňe iki zady bilýärdim
It's fast, big.	Ol çalt, uly.
A lot of good things to do for you	Size etjek köp gowy zat
It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
He could see nothing now.	Ol indi hiç zady görüp bilmedi.
I knew nothing.	Men hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
I can do that	Men muny edip bilerin
I have never seen a better person here	Men bu ýerde has gowy adam görmedim
I have done this many times.	Men muny köp gezek etdim.
He did a bad job.	Ol erbet iş etdi.
He told her no one was there.	Oňa bu ýerde hiç kim ýok diýdi.
I need a few more days with him	Maňa onuň bilen ýene birnäçe gün gerek
I am not at all.	Men asla beýle däl.
He knew things.	Ol zatlary bilýärdi.
I have never seen anything like it	Men munuň ýaly zady görmedim
This is great and really necessary.	Bu ajaýyp we hakykatdanam zerur.
I didn’t care that much at the time	Men şol wagt beýle alada etmedim
He worries about that.	Ol muňa alada edýär.
I can't do that right now	Men muny şu wagt edip bilemok
Not often.	Köplenç däl.
They will not be here.	Olar bu ýerde bolmaz.
I don't think much of it.	Men ol hakda kän pikir etmeýärin.
I thought it wasn't smart.	Bu akylly däl diýip pikir etdim.
He had no time for himself.	Onuň özi üçin wagt ýokdy.
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
I can't, I can't	Mende bolup bilmez, bolmaz
I cared for him	Men onuň üçin alada etdim
Of course, he didn't want to leave.	Elbetde, ol gitmek islemedi.
I knew he wouldn't do it	Men muny etmejekdigini bilýärdim
Not even that.	Hatda beýle däl.
I do not have	Mende ýok
I think that happens to everyone.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hemmeler bilen bolýar.
Now that's all he wants.	Häzir onuň isleýän zady.
I hope he doesn't like it too much	Ol muny gaty halamaýar diýip umyt edýärin
Of course he knew.	Elbetde bilýärdi.
I do not mind.	Muňa garşy däl.
Of course he did.	Elbetde, bu işi etdi.
He started going every night.	Ol her gije gidip başlady.
I didn't really see when it happened	Haçan bolandygyny hakykatdanam görmedim
Maybe it will help.	Belki kömek eder.
I thought and it happened	Men pikir etdim we boldy
I don't think so	Beýle bolmagy mümkin diýip pikir etmeýärin
Looks like a good guy.	Gowy ýigit ýaly görünýär.
There are several answers here.	Bu ýerde birnäçe jogap bar.
Even two people.	Hatda iki adam.
That sounds great.	Bu gaty gowy ýaly.
You are not yet complete.	Siz entek doly däl.
It's about money.	Bu pul hakda.
I was there for a short time.	Men ol ýerde gysga wagt boldum.
Maybe he knows.	Belki bilýän bolsa gerek.
He didn't care about anything right now.	Ol şu wagt hiç zat hakda alada etmedi.
I don't know anything about that	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilemok
He is a wonderful man.	Ol ajaýyp adam.
That could be the case.	Şeýle bolup biler.
I'm sorry, but I have to go	Bagyşlaň, ýöne gitmeli
They need us.	Olar bize mätäç.
I didn’t think long and hard about it	Bu hakda uzak we gaty pikir etmedim
You don't really need much	Hakykatdanam köp zat gerek däl
I think you can help me.	Maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz diýip pikir edýärin.
In fact, this is not always the case.	Aslynda bu hemişe beýle däl.
I think this will be good for you	Bu siziň üçin gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I didn’t want to vote short	Gysga ses bermek islemedim
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
Here are two more.	Ine, ýene iki.
Everything is here and almost ready to go.	Hemme zat şu ýerde we gitmäge taýyn diýen ýaly.
I can get myself here	Men özümi şu ýerde alyp bilerin
I think it was great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy boldy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
I can't give it to you	Men saňa berip bilemok
No more worries.	Başga alada ýok.
I didn't have to do that.	Men muny etmeli däldim.
I didn't have to tell you	Men saňa aýtmaly däldim
Neither is he.	Ol hem däl.
There is no rest.	Dynç ýok.
I was quick.	Men çalt boldum.
I haven't thought about it for years	Birnäçe ýyl bäri ol hakda pikir etmedim
Another opportunity will come.	Başga bir mümkinçilik geler.
It looks weird.	Geň görünýär.
It will take some time to get it.	Ony almak üçin birneme wagt gerek.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
That's the word.	Bu söz hem.
Always great.	Hemişe ajaýyp.
He needs to do something about it quickly.	Ol bu barada çalt bir zat etmeli.
There was a clearer answer.	Has aýdyň jogap bardy.
The two guys are still young.	Iki ýigit henizem ýaş.
He hadn't been there for years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri ol ýerde ýokdy.
I just had to tell him	Men oňa diňe aýtmaly boldum
I gave him everything	Men oňa hemme zady berdim
I no longer believe	Men indi ynanamok
I often do.	Men köplenç edýärin.
That day must be.	Ol gün bolmaly.
A few years.	Birnäçe ýyl.
What can you give?	Näme berip bilersiňiz?
There is no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýok.
I could not see anything.	Men hiç zat görüp bilmedim.
The night is still young.	Gije henizem ýaş.
It was a lot of fun doing it.	Muny etmek gaty hezil boldy.
I was very close to him.	Men oňa gaty ýakyn boldum.
Everyone is gone.	Hemmeler gitdi.
No one knows if it will happen or not.	Boljakdygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny hiç kim bilenok.
He did not inform her that he wanted to do so.	Ol muny etmek isleýändigini oňa habar bermedi.
It should never have happened.	Hiç haçan beýle bolmaly däldi.
I wondered what had happened to him	Men oňa näme boldy diýip pikir etdim
I think they are something else.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar başga zat.
That could be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolup biler.
I just couldn’t recommend it	Diňe maslahat berip bilmedim
I can't help it	Men kömek edip bilemok
I didn't do much.	Men kän etmedim.
I couldn't get it	Men muny alyp bilmedim
Time was everywhere.	Wagt hemme ýerde bardy.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
I couldn't see it that way	Men ony beýle görüp bilmedim
I decided, and that's it	Men karar berdim we bu şeýle boldy
We are so far away.	Biz şeýle uzak.
I can't really do anything else	Men hakykatdanam başga zat edip bilemok
I didn't think about myself.	Özüm hakda pikir etmedim.
In his own language.	Öz dilinde.
He didn't care much.	Ol kän alada etmedi.
I called several more times	Men ýene birnäçe gezek jaň etdim
I think this can help	Bu kömek edip biler diýip pikir edýärin
Most likely.	Iň ähtimal.
I didn't know what happened to him	Oňa näme bolandygyny bilmedim
Nothing was easy for him.	Oňa hiç zat aňsat däldi.
He said tonight.	Ol şu gije aýtdy.
No one thinks about it.	Hiç kim bu hakda hiç zat pikir etmeýär.
Of course, I was not happy	Elbetde, men bagtly däldim
I actually had to go	Aslynda gitmeli boldum
I am not.	Men beýle däl.
What is this 	Bu näme?
he asked.	' diýip sorady.
I can't do anything	Men hiç zat edip bilemok
I didn't want to talk about it anymore	Indi bu hakda gürleşmek islemedim
No one said anything.	Hiç kim hiç zat aýtmady.
So it may not be him.	Şonuň üçin bu onuň däl bolmagy mümkin.
We need more answers.	Bize has köp jogap gerek.
We are not alone.	Biz ýeke däl.
It was a strange day.	Geň gün boldy.
So it can't be that bad.	Şonuň üçin beýle erbet bolup bilmez.
A lot of things were very fast	Köp zat gaty çalt boldy
It's still a long way off.	Bu entek gaty uzak.
I have to go to call	Men jaň etmek üçin gitmeli
This was not true for me.	Bu maňa dogry däldi.
He and I.	Ol we men.
I can't get a job there	Men ol ýere iş alyp bilemok
I really don't have to.	Men hakykatdanam etmeli däl.
This is another matter.	Bu başga mesele.
I have to go tonight	Men şu gije gitmeli
I know how that happened	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilýärin
It won't be like that tomorrow.	Ertir beýle bolmaz.
Of course he does.	Elbetde, pikir edýär.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
You can go	Siz gidip bilersiňiz
It's time to dump her and move on.	Onuň gitmeli wagty geldi.
I only cared about you	Men diňe sen hakda alada etdim
There are good and bad things here.	Bu ýerde gowy we erbet zatlar bar.
I didn't have to	Men beýle bolmaly däldim
He could not.	Ol edip bilmedi.
I have to do this alone	Muny ýeke özüm etmeli
It was not enough.	Ol ýeterlik däldi.
That and nothing else.	Diňe şol we başga hiç zat ýok.
Not alone.	Diňe ýeke däl.
There is nothing and no one to see that there is nothing.	Hiç zat ýok we hiç zadyň ýokdugyny görmek üçin hiç kim ýok.
Right now	Şu wagt.
I didn't really know anything else.	Men hakykatdanam başga zady bilmeýärdim.
I thought it would be me	Bu men bolar öýdüpdim
He's just a guy.	Ol diňe ýigit.
It can be good, it can't be good.	Gowy bolup biler, gowy bolup bilmez.
I'm not busy at all.	Men asla meşgul däl.
It's not night yet.	Entek gije däl.
I didn't see it that way	Men ony beýle görmedim
It can even help.	Bu hatda kömek edip biler.
I thought it looked a little strange	Biraz geň görünýär öýdüpdim
I think he thinks so	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny pikir edýär
I can't give you anything very difficult	Men saňa gaty kyn zat berip bilemok
It turned out well.	Gowy çykdy.
He is not stupid.	Ol samsyk däl.
That's where it went.	Ine, nirä gitdi.
I could see you.	Men seni görüp bilýärdim.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly	Mümkin, edil şonuň ýaly etmeli
There is so much to do here.	Bu ýerde gaty köp zat etmeli.
He did not decide.	Ol karar bermedi.
Very new to me!	Meniň üçin gaty täze!
Of course, man did.	Elbetde, adam şeýle etdi.
Man, but he wasn't there.	Adam, ýöne ol ýerde ýokdy.
It's always there.	Ol ýerde hemişe bar.
I could do something else.	Men başga bir zat edip bilýärdim.
I don't want to know that	Muny bilmek islämok
I couldn't do it anymore	Indi edip bilmedim
This is not for anyone else.	Bu, başga hiç kim üçin däl.
Of course I didn’t try anything	Elbetde hiç zady synap görmedim
Long, long ago	Uzak, öňem
And then I can go back to you	Soň bolsa size gaýdyp bilerin
The thought troubled him.	Bu pikir ony biynjalyk etdi.
Here he is again.	Ine, ol ýene.
I will not have	Mende bolmaz
It can't be bad.	Erbet bolup bilmez.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu şeýle bolmaly.
Next week.	Indiki hepde.
I thought he did something really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy zatlar etdi öýdüpdim.
I don't think he took her home.	Ony öýüne alyp gitdi öýdemok.
I couldn't help it	Men kömek edip bilmedim
It's beautiful.	Bu owadan.
I took everything from you	Men hemme zady senden aldym
I can give it a try	Muny synap görüp bilerin
I know that	Muny bilýärin
Until tonight.	Şu gije çenli.
Someone else did.	Başga biri etdi.
Just two questions.	Diňe iki sorag.
This seems strange.	Bu geň görünýär.
He wants you for something else.	Başga bir zat üçin seni isleýär.
Not today, not at all.	Bu gün däl, hiç wagt däl.
I had never thought of them before	Men olar hakda öňem pikir etmedim
Just one thing.	Diňe bir zat.
He took me too much.	Ol meni gaty köp aldy.
I don't know what to do	Näme etmelidigimi bilemok
I called the police to see if they could help	Kömek edip biljekdigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilmek üçin polisiýa jaň etdim
I saw.	Men gördüm.
It could be a lot, but it was not.	Ol köp zat bolup biler, ýöne beýle däldi.
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
This is not what we need.	Bu bize zerur zat däl.
There was still something to do.	Entek etmeli bir zady bardy.
It takes money.	Munuň üçin pul gerek.
I had no answer, it just came out	Mende jogap ýokdy, diňe çykdy
I couldn't sleep that night	Şol gije uklap bilmedim
Of course there is life.	Elbetde durmuş bar.
I did a lot of work for him here	Men onuň üçin bu ýerde köp iş etdim
Of course I can't.	Elbetde edip bilemok.
I didn’t know anyone could sleep like that	Hiç kimiň beýle uklap biljekdigini bilmeýärdim
I was very busy	Men iş bilen gaty meşgul boldum
I had something else	Mende başga bir zat bardy
Not much anymore.	Indi kän däl.
Who is this really?	Bu hakykatdanam kim.
And they are good.	Olar bolsa gowy.
One is easy.	Biri aňsat.
I just want to help	Men diňe kömek etmek isleýärin
So it can be the most.	Şonuň üçin iň köp bolup biler.
I don't think there's another word for that.	Munuň üçin başga söz ýok öýdýän.
He doesn't know anything else.	Ol başga zady bilmeýär.
Probably not.	Mümkin däl bolsa gerek.
I can't see it	Men muny görüp bilemok
What a guy.	Nähili ýigit.
He wants to be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolmak isleýär.
Whatever you want	Islän zady.
I could barely see	Men görüp bilmedim diýen ýaly
It is worth seeing.	Ony görmek gerek.
It can only be good with money.	Ol diňe pul bilen gowy bolup biler.
I have never been mad at him	Men oňa hiç wagt däli bolup bilmedim
I did everything myself	Hemme zady özüm etdim
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýa-da ýalňyşlyk ýokdy.
He was surprised to see me.	Ol meni görüp geň galdy.
It never seemed to be enough.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik däl ýalydy.
Interesting.	Gyzykly.
I want to talk to them very badly	Men olar bilen gaty erbet gürleşmek isleýärin
That is often not the case.	Ol köplenç beýle däl.
I was not that person	Men ol adam däldim
Tip.	Maslahat.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
I think there are several reasons for this	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar diýip pikir edýärin
He only cares about himself.	Ol diňe özi hakda alada edýär.
I didn't know enough	Men ýeterlik bilmedim
Often this is not a big deal.	Köplenç bu uly mesele däl.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
I knew that everything would be very, very difficult.	Hemme zadyň gaty, hakykatdanam, gaty kyn boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
Not a big guy.	Uly ýigit däl.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
This was never a lie.	Bu hiç haçan ýalan däldi.
Not only was she beautiful.	Diňe onuň owadan bolmagy däldi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Sounds good to me.	Meniň üçin gowy zat ýaly.
I knew he was going to call	Jaň etjekdigini bilýärdim
I have to do it alone	Men muny ýeke özüm etmeli
That shouldn't be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däl.
So it is best to take two weeks off.	Şonuň üçin iki hepde dynç almak gowy.
It was good for them.	Bu olar üçin gowy boldy.
Then everything went well.	Soň hemme zat gowy boldy.
It was very bad.	Gaty erbet boldy.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
I know, I never thought about it	Bilýän, men bu hakda hiç haçan pikir etmedim
I had to do it, someone had to do it.	Etmeli boldy, kimdir biri muny etmeli boldy.
There was never a reason for that	Muňa hiç wagt sebäp ýokdy
It should be very short, very short.	Gaty gysga, gaty gysga bolmaly.
I can agree.	Men razy bolup bilerin.
I couldn't sleep for three nights	Üç gije uklap bilmedim
The biggest problem.	Iň uly mesele.
I didn't really do anything	Men hakykatdanam hiç zat etmedim
I was worried about you.	Men sen hakda alada etdim.
I have never seen this before	Men muny öň görmedim
I just didn’t want to	Diňe islemedim
He is a good man.	Ol gowy adam.
He wants to be happy.	Bagtly bolmak isleýär.
I never saw him again	Men ony ýene görmedim
I told her something today	Men oňa şu gün bir zat aýtdym
I didn't know why he did that	Näme üçin beýle edendigini bilmedim
I am really happy for you.	Men siziň üçin hakykatdanam bagtly.
Not so now.	Häzir beýle däl.
More difficult.	Has kyn.
I had such a time.	Mende şeýle wagt boldy.
I was nothing to you	Men saňa hiç zat däldim
No one knew it.	Muny hiç kim bilmeýärdi.
I didn't have to go.	Men gitmeli däldim.
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
I can	Men edip bilerin
It's not that far.	Bu beýle uzak däl.
What else?	Başga näme bar?
No one has done much about it.	Hiç kim bu barada uly bir zat etmedi.
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
I knew in that look that he had done it several times before.	Munuň öňem birnäçe gezek muny edendigini bilýärdim.
I thought it would be great for you	Bu siziň üçin ajaýyp bolar diýip pikir etdim
I never like it, I don't like it.	Hiç haçan halamok, halamok.
This is a great decision.	Bu ajaýyp karar.
Good night	Gowy gije.
It was almost a night before.	Öňem bir gije diýen ýalydy.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
He came out again.	Ol ýene çykdy.
This is a really bad idea.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet pikir.
It just takes time.	Diňe wagt gerek.
I saw you	Men seni gördüm
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
I thought that would be worrying	Munuň özi alada eder öýdüpdim
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
I don't think you have to worry about anything.	Hiç zat hakda alada etmeli däl öýdemok.
He knows better.	Ol has gowy bilýär.
They are not.	Olar beýle zat däl.
He can do it himself.	Muny özi edip biler.
When did this happen.	Bu haçan boldy.
It does two things.	Bu iki zady edýär.
It's worse now.	Indi has erbet.
Everyone knows that.	Bu barada hemmeler bilýär.
I couldn't think of anything with him	Men bu hakda onuň bilen hiç hili pikir edip bilmedim
I am not.	Men däl.
He doesn't have to say that yet.	Ol entek muny aýtmaly däl.
I am no more.	Men indi ýok.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I could see the Sun now	Men indi Güni görüp bilýärdim
I hope so.	Bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
Good job	Gowy iş.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
This is not life.	Bu durmuş däl.
I gave him the money.	Men oňa pul berdim.
Tonight or tomorrow.	Şu gije ýa-da ertir.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
I can't do these things myself	Bu zatlary özüm edip bilemok
Stop doing that.	Muny etmegi bes et.
I could not see	Görüp bilmedim
You have an offer	Size teklip bar
Last time.	Soňky gezek.
Not bad, not good, nothing.	Erbet däl, gowy däl, hiç zat däl.
There is still a lot of work to be done.	Bu ýerde entek köp iş bar.
You know that.	Muny bilýärsiň.
I thought it was the best thing	Iň gowy zat diýip pikir etdim
I can't think of them that way	Men olar hakda beýle pikir edip bilemok
I know everything about him	Men ol hakda hemme zady bilýärin
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
He just knew he couldn't go.	Diňe gidip bilmejekdigini bilýärdi.
I did everything right.	Men hemme zady dogry etdim.
Not really fast.	Hakykatdanam çalt däl.
I didn’t care for anything	Men hiç zat üçin alada etmedim
I don't think so	Men beýle pikir etmeýärin
It must be good to go.	Gitmek gowy bolmaly.
Oh, well, that's weird.	Aý, bolýar, bu geň.
He did it twice.	Iki gezek etdi.
I don't know	Men muny bilemok
There is no answer here.	Bu ýerde jogap ýok.
I think what happened	Näme boldy diýip pikir edýärin
It didn't work out.	Gowy etmedi.
This may be the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek bolup biler.
I did nothing wrong	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedim
The police are here.	Polisiýa şu ýerde.
The first answer.	Ilkinji jogap.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
That should be sufficient enough.	Bu ýeterlik bolmaly.
No one can say that.	Muny hiç kim aýdyp bilmez.
Many questions.	Köp sorag.
I think this is a great idea.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ajaýyp pikir.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
I thought about it	Men bu hakda pikir etdim
A little while ago.	Biraz öň.
I can promise you	Men size söz berip bilerin
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şeýle üns hemme zat.
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men munuň mümkin däldigini aýtdym
I had nothing for him	Mende onuň üçin ýekeje zat ýokdy
He never did much.	Ol hiç wagt kän bir zat etmedi.
I have to decide	Men karar bermeli
I must have seen what he was going to do	Men onuň näme etjekdigini gören bolmaly
I didn't have a very good answer	Mende gaty gowy jogap ýokdy
He could not afford it.	Ol muny berip bilmedi.
This is a difficult question.	Bu kyn sorag.
I thought.	Men pikir etdim.
Okay, very hard.	Bolýar, gaty kyn.
I never liked it so much	Men muny hiç wagt gaty gowy görmedim
The police want that.	Polisiýa muny isleýär.
I was not	Men beýle däldim
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
And with him.	We onuň bilen.
I don't want to help you	Size kömek etmek islämok
I can't think of anything at all	Men asla hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilemok
Tomorrow is today, today is yesterday.	Ertir şu gün, şu gün düýn bolýar.
I think this would be a great book	Bu gaty gowy kitap bolar diýip pikir edýärin
We are not really here.	Biz aslynda bu ýerde däl.
I'm not really into that.	Men hakykatdanam beýle zat däl.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
It took a few days.	Birnäçe gün aldy.
This is not the case either.	Bu hem däl.
I never want to go!	Men hiç haçan gitmek islämok!
This is not a problem.	Munuň özi mesele däl.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I couldn't care less.	Men bu barada alada edip bilmedim.
I had nothing better	Mende has gowy zat ýokdy
I could be someone else	Men başga biri bolup bilerin
Of course there is no news.	Elbetde hiç wagt habar ýok.
All I have to do is be smart.	Men diňe akylly bolmak üçin etmeli.
That alone will not be the case.	Diňe beýle bolmaz.
Not with this.	Bu bilen däl.
I did not suggest such a thing	Men beýle zady teklip etmedim
No wonder here.	Bu ýerde geň zat ýok.
It can always be.	Elmydama bolup biler.
He never cares.	Ol hiç wagt alada etmeýär.
He didn't tell me about it.	Ol bu hakda maňa aýtmady.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
I'm not good at it.	Men muňa gowy däl.
Then the police called.	Soň polisiýa jaň etdi.
I wanted to suggest this	Men muny teklip etjek boldum
And then there was the book.	Soň bolsa kitap boldy.
I didn't have to go far	Uzak gitmeli däldim
It would be nice to see him.	Ony görmek gowy bolar.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
Nothing, probably.	Hiç zat, ähtimal.
She sings.	Bu aýdym aýdýar.
I want it	Men ony isleýärin
I am now.	Men häzir.
I do this once every time	Men muny her gezek bir gezek edýärin
He knew a lot, a lot.	Köp zat köp zady bilýärdi.
He can still sleep.	Ol henizem uklap biler.
Everyone comes here.	Hemmeler bu ýere gelýär.
I think that's right.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry.
I loved it	Men muny has gowy gördüm
Who knows what can help.	Näme kömek edip biljekdigini kim bilýär.
I didn't think of anything	Men hiç zat pikir etmedim
And then he came out.	Soň bolsa çykdy.
Three nights this week, three nights a week ago.	Bu hepde üç gije, bir hepde öň üç gije.
Of course you can.	Elbetde edip bilersiňiz.
I was happy to see you	Seni görüp hezil etdim
I've been a bit like you	Men seniň ýaly birneme boldum
They seem new.	Olar täze ýaly.
I only have one last question.	Mende diňe soňky bir sorag bar.
He had no answer.	Oňa jogap ýokdy.
You have to get everything right	Hemme zady dogry almaly
No way.	Bolmaz.
I had so much fun with it	Men munuň bilen gaty hezil etdim
Okay, not so bad.	Bolýar, beýle erbet däl.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
Not about that.	Bu hakda däl.
I didn't mean to offend you	Men saňa zyýan bermek islemedim
This is not the case now.	Bu mesele häzir däl.
I have a lot of doubts about that.	Men muňa gaty şübhelenýärin.
This is always the case.	Elmydama şeýle bolýar.
I want to tell her this.	Men oňa muny aýtmak isleýärin.
Tell me.	Aýdyň.
The answer is still no.	Jogap henizem ýok.
I know, but the question is why	Bilýärin, ýöne sorag näme üçin
Not much.	Kän däl.
Okay.	Bolýar.
This is something else.	Bu başga zat.
Something else will happen.	Başga bir zat bolar.
I know a few things about myself	Özüm hakda birnäçe zady bilýärin
No answer yet.	Entek jogap ýok.
He calls me there.	Ol ýerde maňa jaň edýär.
I'm not doing anything for you	Men saňa hiç zat etmeýärin
There is no other option.	Başga mümkinçilik ýok.
I want to go home like you	Seniň ýaly öýe gitmek isleýärin
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu şeýle boldy we muny bilýär.
Maybe not.	Belki beýle bolmaz.
Oh, that's bad.	Aý, bu erbet.
How good!	Nähili gowy!
There may be two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bolup biler.
I thought it was impossible	Bu mümkin däl diýip pikir etdim
Maybe so.	Belki şeýle bolar.
He was already there.	Ol eýýäm bardy.
Just a new person.	Diňe bir täze adam.
Work.	Iş.
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu dogry däl.
I couldn't say a word	Men hiç hili söz aýdyp bilmedim
I know how bad it is	Men munuň nähili erbet isleýändigini bilýärin
It always has been and always will be.	Elmydama bardy we hemişe bolar.
I can never see anything	Men asla hiç zat görüp bilemok
He was not right.	Ol dogry däldi.
This is serious.	Bu çynlakaý.
Maybe not.	Belki beýle bolmaz.
It's really beautiful to see.	Görmek hakykatdanam ajaýyp zat.
Tomorrow is a new day.	Ertir täze gün.
I want to talk to him	Men onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
Take the sun.	Gün almak.
Someone has to do something with it now.	Kimdir biri indi onuň bilen bir zat etmeli.
She is happy.	Ol bagtly.
There is no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýok.
They have to be something.	Olar bir zat bolmaly.
You don't have to.	Şeýle hem etmeli däl.
We are in a new place right now.	Biz şu wagt täze ýerde.
I had one of everything.	Mende hemme zadyň biri bardy.
Now he is gone.	Indi ol gitdi.
We don't know anymore.	Indi bilmeris.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
He is not present.	Ol şu wagt ýok.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
I have to call	Men jaň etmeli
He didn't know much.	Ol köp zady bilmeýärdi.
Not much can be done.	Köp zat bolup bilmez.
He wanted me there.	Ol meni şol ýerde isledi.
So the time has come.	Şonuň üçin wagt geldi.
The time must be right.	Wagty dogry bolmaly.
I couldn't get the best news.	Iň gowy habar alyp bilmedim.
I can answer now.	Men indi jogap berip bilerin.
I'm not ready to do that yet	Men entek muny etmäge taýyn däldim
Only there.	Diňe şol ýerde.
I did, the problem is still there	Men etdim, mesele henizem bar
I am happy.	Men bagtly.
At the same time,.	Şol bir wagtda,.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I said that.	Men muny aýtdym.
And then forgive yourself.	Soň bolsa özi üçin bagyşlaň.
I can't see much	Men köp zady görüp bilemok
He always does that today.	Häzirki wagtda elmydama şeýle edýär.
You really are something.	Siz hakykatdanam bir zat.
This is not really the case.	Bu hakykatdanam beýle däl.
A little hard.	Biraz kyn.
One wonders why he did that	Biri näme üçin beýle etdi diýip pikir edýär
So I need some help.	Şonuň üçin maňa biraz kömek gerek.
Too many every day.	Her gün gaty köp.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
That's it.	Bu şol.
There was a big reason for that.	Munuň üçin uly bir sebäp bardy.
I had to tell you	Saňa aýtmaly boldum
I'm so scared of him	Men ony gaty gorkýaryn
I called him and he said again.	Men oňa jaň etdim, ol ýene aýtdy.
Only we are happy.	Diňe biz bagtly.
I didn't have that opportunity	Mende beýle mümkinçilik ýokdy
I didn't see that.	Men muny görmedim.
This is for you.	Bu siziň üçin.
I already did.	Men eýýäm etdim.
Great road.	Uly ýol.
Of course, he is not here.	Elbetde, ol bu ýerde däl.
I really don't care	Men hakda hakykatdanam alada etmeýärin
This was the first.	Bu ilkinji boldy.
No working hours.	Iş wagty ýok.
It can only be a few days.	Diňe birnäçe gün bolup biler.
I'm not working for that.	Munuň üçin iş etmeýärin.
I got something else here	Men şu ýerde başga bir zady aldym
I couldn't stop thinking about him or myself.	Men ol hakda ýa-da özüm hakda pikir etmegi bes edip bilmedim.
He decided to do it.	Ol bu barada karar berdi.
I'd like to try this on.	Muny synap görmek isleýärin.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
That's all we need.	Bu bize gerek zat.
I was still me, but in reality it was not	Men henizem men boldum, ýöne aslynda beýle däldi
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
In fact, no one did.	Aslynda hiç kim etmedi.
Not just you.	Diňe siz däl.
I can't, I can't, I can't	Men edip bilemok, edip bilemok, edip bilemok
I may need someone to help me.	Maňa kömek etjek biri gerek bolup biler.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy iş.
This, of course, was difficult for me.	Bu, elbetde, meniň üçin kyn boldy.
No one was going to do that for you.	Hiç kim seniň üçin muny etjek däldi.
He told himself this.	Ol özüne muny aýtdy.
I was not surprised or mad	Men geň görmedim ýa-da däli däldim
What a day.	Näme gün.
Of course, this is possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin.
It can be short, but it can be fun.	Gysga bolup biler, ýöne gyzykly hem bolup biler.
I did it for you.	Men muny saňa etdim.
I think we can help you	Size kömek edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin
And then you have to go.	Soň bolsa gitmeli.
I can tell you something	Men sen hakda zatlar aýdyp bilerin
The answer is nothing.	Jogap hiç zat däl.
We need something else.	Bize başga zat gerek.
I think he should rest	Meniň pikirimçe, ol dynç almaly
I have to be like everyone else.	Men hemmeler ýaly bolmaly.
I need more time	Maňa has köp wagt gerek
You are very interesting	Siz gaty gyzykly
He needs it.	Oňa mätäç.
I don't want to do that.	Men beýle etmek islämok.
In fact, I never thought about it	Aslynda bu hakda asla pikir etmedim
This is how it looks.	Ine, şeýle görünýär.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	Şol wagt gowy pikir ýalydy.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I can do it myself now	Muny indi özüm edip bilerin
I can't do that	Men muny beýle edip bilemok
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Belki, belki, belki.
You have to rest.	Dynç almaly.
I never cared	Men asla alada etmedim
I hope it will be good	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I noticed that.	Men muňa üns berdim.
This guy.	Bu ýigit.
He will only destroy you.	Ol diňe sizi ýok eder.
He left quickly.	Ol çalt gitdi.
He was not ready yet.	Ol entek taýyn däldi.
I just know it's not enough to be there.	Diňe şol ýerde bolmak ýeterlik däldigini bilýärin.
I have enough for you today.	Bu gün saňa ýeterlik boldum.
Just fine.	Diňe gowy.
What happened to you is really bad.	Saňa näme boldy hakykatdanam erbet.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, hakykatdanam geň zat.
I hope you can help.	Kömek edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt edýärin.
I'm calling	Men jaň edýärin
This is not a new book.	Bu täze kitap däl.
You don't have to say it out loud	Munuň ýaly zatlary gaty ses bilen aýtmaly däl
"Sorry, no."	Bagyşlaň, ýok "diýdi.
Such things.	Şeýle zatlar.
I can't, it's a wonderful thing	Edip bilemok, bu ajaýyp zat
Not many people know what they want	Köp adam näme isleýändigini bilenok
I will call you every evening	Her gün agşam saňa jaň ederin
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
I called several times, but there was no answer	Birnäçe gezek jaň etdim, ýöne jogap ýok
You need to rest a little	Biraz dynç almaly
I know he knows.	Bilýändigini bilýärin.
I'll make it fast.	Men ony çalt ederin.
This is really good news.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp habar.
I had to do it myself.	Muny özüm etmeli boldum.
I could do it myself	Men muny özüm edip bilýärdim
This is a job.	Bu bir iş.
Another way.	Başga ýol.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
He had two other people with him.	Onuň bilen başga iki adam bardy.
He could do nothing.	Ol hiç zat edip bilmedi.
You have to answer for that.	Munuň üçin jogap bermeli.
Like everyone else.	Hemmeler ýaly.
One thing for sure.	Elbetde, bir zat.
I can tell you a lot about it	Men size bu barada köp zat aýdyp bilerin
In the same way, the sun has risen.	Edil şonuň ýaly, gün çykdy.
Of course, I didn't think so	Elbetde, muny siziň pikiriňizçe pikir etmedim
I didn't have to go that far	Men beýle gitmeli däldim
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
It's morning.	Irden boldy.
I saw no other way	Başga ýol görmedim
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
I know, because he told me that	Bilýärin, sebäbi ol maňa şeýle diýdi
I can't tell you about it	Men bu hakda size aýdyp biljek däl
I am the only one there.	Men ol ýerde ýekeje men.
There is no one but me.	Menden başga hiç kim ýok.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Bu gaty kyn bolmaly däl "-diýdi.
A year left, and then he came back.	Bir ýyl galdy, soň bolsa gaýdyp geldi.
I just thought.	Men diňe pikir etdim.
They are not that far away.	Olar beýle uzak däl.
I have to decide	Men karar bermeli
He could not say it.	Ol muny aýdyp bilmedi.
Now another.	Indi başga.
Not just the best.	Diňe iň gowy zat däldi.
I can't take another day anymore	Indi başga gün alyp bilemok
I am just a man	Men diňe bir adam
In addition.	Mundan başga.
Of course, it can't be complete.	Elbetde, doly bolup bilmez.
Maybe he knows.	Belki bilýän bolmagy mümkin.
I hope it will be good	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I didn't want to do that	Men muny etmek islemedim
I can't do that to you	Men muny saňa edip bilemok
I know this can't be true	Munuň dogry bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärin
So it takes a few weeks.	Şonuň üçin birnäçe hepde gerek.
This is certainly true.	Bu, elbetde, gaty dogry.
There is nothing that anyone can do about it.	Hiç kimiň edip biljek zady ýok.
I have to call the police	Men polisiýa jaň etmeli
I think it takes time	Wagt gerek diýip pikir edýärin
Sorry, he said.	Bagyşlaň, ol aýtdy.
I shouldn't have hurt you	Men saňa zyýan bermeli däldim
Now it's not easy, but it's possible.	Indi bu aňsat däl, ýöne mümkin.
A few years.	Birnäçe ýyl.
This is a way.	Bu bir ýol.
I didn't know why	Näme üçin şol wagt bilmedim
It was a great weekend.	Dynç güni gaty gowy boldy.
Once again.	Ýene bir gezek.
He took everything.	Bar zadyny aldy.
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däl.
Then he started working again.	Soň bolsa ýene işe başlady.
I have to be.	Men bolmaly.
I'm just thinking about you	Men diňe sen hakda pikir edýärin
In fact, it is very good.	Aslynda bu gaty gowy.
Of course very fast.	Elbetde gaty çalt.
I care, for you every day	Alada edýärin, her gün siziň üçin
He can't take me anywhere.	Ol meni hiç ýere alyp bilmez.
You are stupid	Sen samsyk.
Of course, he is not serious.	Elbetde, ol çynlakaý däl.
You are there	Sen şol ýerde
Not yet	Entek däl
Things to do.	Bar etmeli zatlary.
And it will be with us.	We biziň bilen bolar.
There is good news for you	Siziň üçin gowy habar bar
I think you can do better	Has gowy edip bilersiňiz diýip pikir edýärin
On the ground	Ýerde.
To give hope	Umyt bermek.
They are for you.	Olar siziň üçin.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
I can do what I can't do	Men edip bilmeýän zadyny edip bilerin
It was not.	Däldi.
I never worried about that	Men bu barada asla alada etmedim
I didn't have much time	Mende beýle köp wagt ýokdy
And then there was the book.	Soň bolsa kitap boldy.
This is a complete lie.	Bu düýbünden ýalan.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
There is another call. 	Başga bir jaň bar. 
You can go home.	Öýe gidip bilersiňiz.
I don't know how to tell you.	Men saňa nädip aýdyp biljekdigini bilemok.
I have never been able to harm you	Men saňa hiç wagt zyýan berip bilmedim
He doesn't like it.	Ol muny halamaýar.
Great day just for everyone	Diňe hemmeler üçin ajaýyp gün
Maybe something happened.	Belki bir zat bolup geçen bolsa gerek.
Here is the good news.	Ine gowy habar.
You really aren't something like that.	Siz hakykatdanam onuň ýaly zat däl.
He did nothing.	Ol hiç zat etmedi.
I don't agree with you right now.	Men şu wagt senden razy däl.
He must.	Ol hökman.
I heard.	Men eşitdim.
It's everywhere now	Häzirki wagtda hemme ýerde
I can promise you.	Men size söz berip bilerin.
Because it was never a problem for me.	Sebäbi bu meniň üçin hiç wagt mesele däldi.
I saw it beautifully	Men owadan gördüm
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
It was not difficult.	Kyn däldi.
I never wanted to hurt him	Men oňa hiç wagt zyýan bermek islemedim
This is great	Bu gaty gowy
It was never necessary.	Bu hiç haçan zerur däldi.
It looks weird.	Geň görünýär.
It's good, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Gowy "-diýdi.
Not you or him.	Size ýa-da oňa däl.
There must be someone about it.	Bu hakda biri bolmaly.
This is not true here.	Bu ýerde dogry däl.
I didn’t have to say it out loud	Men muny gaty ses bilen aýtmaly däldim
As it was two years ago.	Iki ýyl öňküsi ýaly.
He did not want to.	Ol islemedi.
I can do that, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau	Muny edip bilerin "-diýdi
I really want you there	Men sizi hakykatdanam şol ýerde isleýärin
Then he fell asleep.	Soň bolsa uklap galdy.
I don't have to do that	Men muny etmeli däl
Only.	Diňe.
I can't do that right now	Men muny şu wagt edip bilemok
I went to the police and confessed	Polisiýa baryp, boýun aldym
I gave it my all	Men oňa hemmesini berdim
I had all the attention	Mende hemme üns bardy
Because it takes a lot of time to do something new.	Sebäbi täze bir zat etmek üçin gaty köp wagt gerek.
You know one thing.	Bir zady bilýärsiň.
Immediately the issue is different.	Derrew mesele başga.
I just need time	Maňa diňe wagt gerek
I know everything about you	Men sen hakda hemme zady bilýärin
So this is not a question.	Şonuň üçin bu sorag däl.
He didn't know it anymore.	Oňa indi bilmeýärdi.
time	wagt.
There must be something wrong.	Biraz ýalňyşlyk bolmaly.
The time is too short.	Wagt gaty gysga.
I stopped calling him	Men oňa jaň etmegi bes etdim
I was nowhere	Men hiç ýerde däldim
Just a book.	Diňe kitap.
You are very close	Siz gaty ýakyn
Who knew, but one thing.	Kim bilýärdi, ýöne bir zat.
I can buy you time	Men size wagt satyn alyp bilerin
You don't really need something big.	Size hakykatdanam uly zat gerek däl.
I didn't have to tell him	Men oňa aýtmaly däldim
He can be right.	Ol dogry aýdyp biler.
He knew everything.	Ol hemme zady bilýärdi.
I think this is for me	Meniň pikirimçe, bu meniň üçin
I got the message yesterday	Düýn habar aldym
That's what I got from you.	Men senden şeýle aldym.
There was no such thing.	Şeýle mesele ýokdy.
You have to do more than that	Mundan has köp zat etmeli
A lot of people know about the girl.	Gyz hakda gaty köp adam bilýär.
I really don't know	Men hakykatdanam bilemok
I don’t think anyone else paid attention	Başga hiç kim üns bermedi öýdemok
I immediately bought one	Men derrew birini satyn aldym
I think it will be interesting	Bu gyzykly bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I don't know anything about him	Men ol hakda düýbünden hiç zat bilemok
He said this.	Ol muny aýtdy.
That's all.	Bu hemme zat.
I thought it was great	Bu gaty gowy diýip pikir etdim
They are very difficult.	Olar gaty kyn.
I think he did it very well	Meniň pikirimçe, muny gaty gowy alyp bardy
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Stupid, but very good.	Samsyk, ýöne gaty gowy.
Oh, from now on.	Aý, mundan beýläk.
He must be alone there.	Ol ýerde ýeke özi bolmaly.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
I have to do something about it	Men bu hakda bir zat etmeli
I'm so sorry this week	Şu hepde gaty gynanýaryn
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
They are wonderful.	Olar ajaýyp.
He knows what.	Ol näme bilýär.
I think it will be faster.	Bu has çalt bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
I said a lot.	Men gaty köp zat aýtdym.
He knows about me.	Ol meniň hakda bilýär.
In a loud voice.	Gaty ses bilen.
He decided to do it.	Ol bu barada karar berdi.
He gave it to me.	Ol maňa berdi.
I know you have.	Siziň bardygyny bilýärin.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
Good.	Gowy.
I never want to be alone	Men hiç haçan ýeke bolmak islämok
Now that is strange.	Indi bu geň.
I think he is very good.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gaty gowy.
This too.	Bu hem.
In fact, he took me twice.	Aslynda, meni iki gezek aldy.
No one wants that!	Hiç kim muny islemeýär!
Maybe not.	Belki beýle däldi.
I didn't know what he could do	Men onuň näme edip biljekdigini bilmeýärdim
The police want to talk to you.	Polisiýa siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýär.
I don't know how to do that	Muny nädip edip biljekdigini bilemok
I'm so scared of him	Men oňa gaty gorkýaryn
No one did.	Hiç kim etmedi.
You are one	Sen bir.
I know what he's doing	Men onuň näme edýändigini bilýärin
I can't even rest for a week.	Hatda bir ýerde bir hepde dynç alyp bilemok.
I have to get it.	Men almaly.
He did not say anything.	Ol hiç zat aýtmady.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Uly mesele.
Of course, this is the case here.	Elbetde, bu ýerde şeýle.
That's right.	Dogry.
I can even agree with you	Men hatda siziň bilen razy bolup bilerin
I can get it tonight	Men ony şu gije alyp bilerin
In fact, for us, this problem didn’t even exist.	Aslynda, biziň üçin bu mesele hatda ýokdy.
I don't want it anymore	Indi islämok
This is a stupid question.	Bu samsyk sorag.
It makes me happy.	Bu meni bagtly edýär.
That's it.	Bu zat.
You can be a girl	Siz gyz bolup bilersiňiz
Where is he now?	Ol indi nirede.
It was great.	Gaty gowy boldy.
Of course it should be.	Elbetde, şeýle bolmaly.
I thought he would have fun	Ol hezil eder öýdüpdim
I let him do it	Men oňa muny etmäge rugsat berdim
He wanted to go.	Ol gitmek isledi.
It was not good for us.	Bu biziň üçin gowy däldi.
He had a chance.	Oňa mümkinçilik bardy.
I never saw him again	Men ony ýene görmedim
I didn't know what to do	Meni näme etmelidigimi bilmedim
Of course, both are true.	Elbetde, iki zat hem dogry.
I'm worried right now	Men şu wagt alada edýärin
I didn’t want to talk about these crazy things again	Bu däli zatlar hakda ýene gürleşmek islemedim
I want to be like that	Men şeýle bolmak isleýärin
You don't have to worry about anything.	Hiç zat hakda alada etmeli däl.
It's over now.	Bu indi boldy.
He is not alone.	Ol ýeke däl.
Of course.	Elbetde.
So tell me what happened.	Şonuň üçin maňa näme bolandygyny aýdyň.
I think they're last	Meniň pikirimçe, olar soňky ýerde
He does a lot tonight.	Ol şu gije köp zat edýär.
He did not want to give up.	Ol özüni bermek islemedi.
I'll do it right away.	Men derrew ederin.
I had a lot of fun	Gaty hezil etdim
He comes here every year.	Ol bu ýere her ýyl gaýdyp gelýär.
Of course, he called.	Elbetde, jaň etdi.
That's a lot.	Bu hakykatdanam köp zat.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
It won't be a month.	Bir aý bolmaz.
I just thought of myself there	Men diňe özümi şol ýerde pikir etdim
I really enjoyed it	Menden gaty lezzet aldym
Everyone knew that.	Muny hemmeler bilýärdi.
She is worried.	Ony biynjalyk edýär.
He got it later.	Soň aldy.
I care about everything	Men hemme zat hakda alada edýärin
I will help you	Size kömek etjek bolaryn
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
It seemed like an impossible task.	Mümkin däl mesele ýalydy.
I'll have to do that.	Men muny etmeli bolaryn.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
He wanted another voice.	Başga bir ses isledi.
That sounds really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy ýaly.
It happened.	Ol boldy.
He asked how this could be.	Ol munuň nähili bolup biljekdigini sorady.
I can't help it.	Men muňa kömek edip bilemok.
He will.	Ol eder.
I knew he would never do it.	Men hiç haçan etmejekdigini bilýärdim.
I thought about going home	Öýe gitmek hakda pikir etdim
So good.	Şonuň üçin gowy.
I decided	Men karar berdim
I know he cares	Men onuň alada edýändigini bilýärin
Only one person.	Diňe bir adam.
I want to be great	Ajaýyp bolmak isleýärin
Because he knows.	Sebäbi ol bilýär.
I tried everything	Men hemme zady synap gördüm
It will not be good either.	Şeýle hem gowy bolmaz.
I don't need it.	Ol maňa gerek däl.
I can't do that	Men muny edip bilemok
I want to know how	Nädip boljakdygyny bilmek isleýärin
Every last one is great.	Her soňky ajaýyp.
This is not serious.	Bu çynlakaý däl.
There are no people here.	Bu ýerde adam ýok.
This is good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy.
I had no choice.	Mende hiç hili mümkinçilik ýokdy.
You need great help.	Size uly kömek gerek.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
I am always here.	Men hemişe şu ýerde.
I think it has to be somewhere.	Meniň pikirimçe, bir ýerde bolmaly.
I don't think he wanted to go	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gitmek islemedi
We may never know what happened.	Näme bolandygyny, belki, asla bilmeris.
They are clear.	Olar aýdyň.
I didn't mean to offend you	Saňa aýtmak islemedim
I couldn't be happier	Men has bagtly bolup bilmedim
They too.	Olar hem.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
He could not decide.	Ol karar berip bilmedi.
I can't say more.	Has köp zat aýdyp biljek däl.
Maybe he knows something.	Belki, ol bir zady bilýär.
He has done this several times.	Ol muny birnäçe gezek etdi.
It's really easy.	Hakykatdanam aňsat.
Of course not.	Elbetde däl.
Nothing else will happen.	Başga hiç zat bolmaz.
About him.	Ol hakda.
I didn’t know how this could be possible	Munuň nädip mümkin boljakdygyny bilmedim
The question is who to buy.	Mesele kimi satyn almaly.
This is indeed the case.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
Now there is.	Indi bar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle bolmaly.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
He later admitted that he had done the same.	Soň bolsa özüni hem edendigini boýun aldy.
Another way.	Başga ýol.
He knows everything.	Ol hemme zady bilýär.
What really happens.	Aslynda näme bolýar.
Available now.	Häzirki wagtda bar.
I never thought about it.	Men bu barada hiç wagt pikir etmedim.
I don't want to talk to you	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek islämok
I tried to help her, but she didn't help me	Men oňa kömek etjek boldum, ýöne ol kömek etmedi
I think it's good.	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
Not only bad.	Diňe erbet däldi.
Maybe this book will help a little.	Belki bu kitap birneme kömek eder.
There was no Sun this summer.	Bu tomus Gün ýokdy.
I've been here for a month	Men bu ýerde bir aý
This is strange	Bu geň zat
I never knew he would think that way	Men onuň beýle pikir edýändigini hiç wagt bilmeýärdim
I think we can do that	Muny edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin
No wonder.	Geň zat ýok.
This time it was not a lie.	Bu wagt ýalan däldi.
It is not yet, but it will be soon.	Ol entek däldi, ýöne ýakyn wagtda bolar.
Maybe he can help me.	Belki, ol maňa kömek edip biler.
Tonight is for us.	Bu gije biziň üçin.
It could be a sound.	Bu ses bolup biler.
It's really beautiful.	Bu hakykatdanam owadan.
For me.	Meniň üçin.
You are very young	Sen gaty ýaş
I was very concerned about this issue	Bu mesele hakda gaty alada etdim
These are good things.	Bu gowy zatlar.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
A little, but not a lot.	Biraz, ýöne kän däl.
I have my own.	Meniň özüm bar.
I, of course, will	Men, özüm, elbetde şeýle ederin
It's really fun and easy to get.	Muny hakykatdanam gyzykly we almak gaty aňsat.
Then came the sound.	Soň ses geldi.
He, of course, told me.	Ol, elbetde, maňa aýtdy.
Not enough time.	Wagt ýeterlik däl.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
They are not stupid.	Olar samsyk däl.
I had to rest a bit	Biraz dynç almaly boldum
Man, they are beautiful.	Adam, olar owadan.
Now it's time to dump her and move on.	Indi muny etmegiň wagty geldi.
I could not admit to doing what was right	Dogry edenini boýun alyp bilmedim
This is about me.	Bu meniň hakda.
I did it right away	Men derrew etdim
He got what he wanted.	Islän zadyny aldy.
I will definitely do that.	Muny hökman hökman ederin.
Another person	Başga adam
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
I hope this will be good for you.	Bu siziň üçin gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
It was a good time for everyone	Hemmeler üçin gowy wagt boldy
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
Of course tell.	Elbetde aýdyň.
This can help.	Bu kömek edip biler.
A good life here is impossible for me	Bu ýerde gowy durmuş meniň üçin mümkin däl
Just with you	Diňe seniň bilen.
I hope it will be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
.	.
I know this is for me.	Munuň meniň üçin bolandygyny bilýärin.
I have no problem.	Mende hiç hili mesele ýok.
I don't know him	Men ony bilemok
Couldn't be	Bolup bilmedi
The last question was yesterday.	Iň soňky sorag düýn boldy.
I can't say it happened this time.	Bu gezek şeýle boldy diýip biljek däl.
Someone had to tell him.	Kimdir biri oňa aýtmaly bolardy.
Not just anywhere else.	Diňe başga ýere däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu meniň hakda iň gowy zat.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Just talk.	Diňe gürleşmek.
I can't go to the police, but you can	Polisiýa baryp bilemok, ýöne edip bilersiňiz
You are not close at all.	Siz asla ýakyn däl.
I think I have to do something.	Diňe bir zat etmeli öýdýän.
This is great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy.
I didn’t really have to.	Men hakykatdanam hökman däldim.
We are no longer alone.	Biz indi ýeke däl.
In fact, there is no other way.	Aslynda başga ýol ýok.
I was the next weekend	Indiki dynç güni boldum
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
What happened is crazy.	Näme boldy däli.
He was there, just not enough.	Ol bardy, diňe ýeterlik däldi.
He likes it right away and they do.	Ony derrew halaýar we olar bolýar.
I think it should be.	Meniň pikirimçe bolmaly.
I am a really happy person	Men hakykatdanam bagtly adam
I know this is not the case now	Häzir beýle däldigini bilýärin
There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
He almost can't do it.	Ol muny edip bilmeýär diýen ýaly.
Not just an opportunity.	Diňe bir mümkinçilik däl.
That's a good thing.	Ine, bir gowy zat.
Maybe you can tell me.	Belki, maňa aýdyp bilersiňiz.
I saw him last night	Men ony düýn gije gördüm
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
This is a complete lie.	Bu düýbünden ýalan.
He knows more.	Ol has köp zady bilýär.
He shouldn't be here.	Ol bu ýerde bolmaly däl.
He didn't want it.	Ol ony islemedi.
Not only that.	Diňe beýle däl.
Two things are required.	Iki zat hökman.
I already knew that	Men muny öňem bilýärdim
I think so.	Men pikir edýärin.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
I'm close now	Men häzir ýakyn
We can go back again.	Başga bir gezek gaýdyp bileris.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
I hope he already has.	Ol eýýäm bardy diýip umyt edýärin.
I can't do it right now	Edil şu wagt edip bilemok
I can see that.	Men muny görüp bilýärin.
Tell me it's not bad.	Erbet däldigini aýdyň.
I can call now.	Häzir jaň edip bilerin.
I couldn't get it right now	Häzirki wagtda alyp bilmedim
It seemed like a long time.	Uzak ýalydy.
I just want to be	Men diňe bolmak isleýärin
He even offered me more money.	Ol hatda maňa has köp pul teklip etdi.
In short.	Gysga.
He will never know.	Ol hiç haçan bilmez.
That's one.	Biri şol.
I think it turned out really well.	Hakykatdanam gowy çykdy diýip pikir edýärin.
You might think so.	Şeýle pikir edip bilersiňiz.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow.	Belki bu gün däl, belki ertir däl.
I'll call right away	Men derrew jaň ederin
In fact, he did not.	Aslynda muny etmedi.
A lot of people like it.	Köp adam muny halaýar.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
I hope it will be good	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
That was not the case before.	Ozal beýle däldi.
It was not good.	Gowy däldi.
he said.	diýdi.
He knows what to do.	Näme etmelidigini biler.
He is no longer here.	Indi ol bu ýerde däl.
I want to go somewhere else	Men düýbünden başga ýere gitmek isleýärin
You can't help it.	Oňa kömek edip bolmaz.
Everything seems to be the only thing.	Her bir zat diňe ýeke-täk bir zat ýaly bolup görünýär.
I'm new to it.	Men oňa täze.
Not too fast.	Gaty çalt däl.
I think it will be possible	Mümkin bolar diýip pikir edýärin
There was even a girl.	Hatda bir gyz bardy.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
I just have to be alone	Men diňe ýeke bolmaly
What happened?	Bu näme boldy.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, edil şonuň ýaly bolýar.
Not enough today.	Bu gün ýeterlik däl.
I'm not with the police.	Men polisiýa bilen däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
I hope this helps you.	Munuň size kömek etjekdigine umyt etdim.
I knew he was not crazy	Men onuň däli däldigini bilýärdim
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa ýol bermedi.
He never thought he would do it.	Aslynda muny etjekdigini hiç wagt pikir etmedi.
He wanted to.	Ol isledi.
I have nothing wrong with them	Olar bilen erbet zadym ýok
I know how crazy this is, but it happened	Munuň nähili däli bolandygyny bilýärin, ýöne şeýle boldy
They are for him.	Olar onuň üçin.
Only, really.	Diňe, hakykatdanam.
I told her what had happened.	Men oňa näme bolandygyny aýtdym.
This is my thing.	Bu meniň zadym.
Very good at home.	Öýde gaty gowy.
He did not tell anyone.	Ol hiç kime aýtmady.
I think that's the only thing for him	Meniň pikirimçe, bu onuň üçin diňe bir zat
What a bad thing this is.	Bu nähili erbet iş.
I was not alone here.	Men bu ýerde ýeke däldim.
I believe this can be done for you too	Munuň hem siziň üçin edip biljekdigine ynanýaryn
I need an early night	Maňa ir gije gerek
We and they are not.	Biz we olar ýok.
He did a great job.	Ajaýyp iş etdi.
There is a reason for this.	Munuň bir sebäbi bar.
There is nothing here.	Bu ýerde bar ýok.
I almost always do that.	Men muny hemişe diýen ýaly edýärin.
I never knew it could be so fast	Munuň çalt bolup biljekdigini hiç wagt bilmeýärdim
I should never give a reason.	Maňa hiç wagt sebäp bermeli däl.
I thought there would be a lot of good things	Gowy zatlar köp bolar öýdüpdim
I have to ask you a few questions	Size birnäçe sorag bermeli
I don’t have a good idea about that right now.	Häzir bu hakda gowy pikir ýok.
I'm happy about that.	Men muňa begenýärin.
It took a while, but it happened.	Biraz wagt gerek boldy, ýöne şeýle boldy.
I couldn't get enough of it	Men muňa ýeterlik bolup bilmedim
I almost trust you	Men saňa ynanýaryn diýen ýaly
I didn't think so	Men beýle pikir etmedim
Ma'am.	Bu.
I heard about it.	Men bu hakda eşitdim.
That would be something.	Bu bir zat bolardy.
I still feel sorry for him	Men henizem oňa gynanýaryn
Then someone else started.	Soň başga biri başlady.
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Munuň nähili boljakdygyny aýtdym
I won't be here long	Men bu ýerde uzak bolmaz
Please immediately.	Derrew haýyş edýärin.
He would be here right now.	Ol şu wagt şu ýerde bolardy.
I was the first to see this	Muny ilkinji bolup gören men boldum
This will not be the case with you.	Bu siziň bilen beýle bolmaz.
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
These things are smart.	Bu zatlar akylly.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
He even said it would happen.	Ol hatda boljakdygyny aýtdy.
I have never been happier	Men hiç wagt bagtly bolup görmedim
It's not like that.	Bu onuň ýaly däl.
I'm not that stupid	Men gaty samsyk däl
You are not much.	Sen kän zat däl.
I had to pay attention	Üns bermeli boldum
He took it almost immediately.	Ol derrew diýen ýaly alyp gitdi.
Then both.	Soň ikisi-de.
I haven't called in two weeks.	Iki hepde bäri jaň etmedim.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
It won't be long.	Bu indi kän bolmaz.
No big deal.	Uly mesele ýok.
I had to say something	Men bir zat aýtmaly boldum
I've been everywhere	Men hemme ýerde boldum
Oh, no, nothing like that.	Aý, ýok, beýle zat ýok.
This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
That's a lot.	Bu birneme köp.
I couldn't think of anything and no one else	Hiç zat we başga hiç kim hakda pikir edip bilmedim
Something is wrong, still.	Bir zat dogry däl, henizem.
I just thought it was right	Diňe dogry zat diýip pikir etdim
He didn't either.	Ol hem etmedi.
Not everyone was able to do that.	Hemmeler muny edip bilmedi.
I said a lot.	Men köp zat aýtdym.
This happens with them.	Bu olar bilen bolýar.
I can get it	Men muny alyp bilerin
It will be better in the morning.	Irden has gowy bolar.
I never wanted you here	Men seni bu ýerde hiç haçan islemedim
I just can't do it	Diňe edip bilemok
I'm sorry she can't sing	Gynanýaryn, sebäbi aýdym aýdyp bilmeýär
I had no such thing	Mende beýle zat ýokdy
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
No more meat.	Indi et ýok.
It didn't seem to be there.	Ol ýerde bar ýaly däldi.
I will be close if I need something	Bir zat gerek bolsa, ýakyn bolaryn
I haven't seen you all summer	Men seni bütin tomus görmedim
You may be next.	Indiki bolup bilersiňiz.
I thought it would be okay	Men muňa garşy bolmaz diýip pikir etdim
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
I know, it's a big mistake.	Bilýärin, uly ýalňyşlyk.
I want to be us	Biz bolmak isleýärin
This is not what he needed.	Bu oňa zerur kömek däl.
I am new.	Men täze.
I could not see anything	Men hiç zady görüp bilmedim
I told you a lot.	Men saňa köp zat aýtdym.
I knew nothing.	Men hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
I was like that.	Men şeýle boldum.
It was crazy.	Bu däli boldy.
For this time	Bu gezek üçin
I don't think it's possible to do that	Muny etmek mümkin däl öýdemok
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şeýle boldy.
It's hard to tell.	Habar bermek kyn.
I hope it will be one.	Bir bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
This is a complete lie.	Bu düýbünden ýalan.
I am against it.	Men muňa garşy.
He said he understood.	Ol düşündi diýdi.
I just have to do these things	Men diňe şu zatlary etmeli
He knows what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini biler.
I thought he was gone	Men ol gitdi öýdüpdim
Where are you now	Häzir sen nirede
Something was wrong.	Bir zat dogry däldi.
I can't see him anymore	Men ony indi görüp bilemok
Of course, he said.	Elbetde, ol aýtdy.
Now he is a full man	Indi ol doly adam
I knew he had it.	Men onuň bardygyny bilýärdim.
I think no news is good news	Hiç hili habar gowy habar däl öýdýän
I need it	Maňa mätäç bolmagy gerek
It would be right to do that.	Haçan muny etmek dogry bolar.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
I didn't care what happened	Bolýan zatlar hakda alada etmedim
I had to do something	Men bir zat etmeli boldum
It's easier.	Bu has aňsat.
He never knew it.	Ol muny hiç wagt bilmeýärdi.
It will not happen again.	Mundan beýläk bolmaz.
It was not so difficult.	Muny etmek beýle kyn däldi.
It's easy and fun.	Bu aňsat we gyzykly.
He seemed to want to talk.	Ol gürleşmek isleýän ýalydy.
He didn't want anything else with him.	Ol onuň bilen başga hiç zat islemedi.
I think he can still answer you.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol henizem saňa jogap berip biler.
That was not the case before.	Ozal beýle däldi.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
He was right.	Dogry aýtdy.
It's too early to say.	Munuň üçin iş entek ir.
It actually makes it interesting.	Aslynda muny gyzykly edýär.
There is a bit of a problem there	Ol ýerde birneme kynçylyk
I know a lot, you know	Köp zady bilýärin, bilýärsiň
He can really do it.	Hakykatdanam edip biler.
I can't say right now	Häzir aýdyp biljek däl
He can't either.	Ol hem edip bilmeýär.
Ma'am.	Bu.
I just have to do it.	Men diňe etmeli.
No one wanted to give him a job.	Hiç kim oňa iş bermek islemedi.
I could not see that this was possible	Munuň mümkin boljakdygyny görüp bilmedim
He does the same.	Edil şol bir zady edýär.
Life was hard.	Durmuş kyn boldy.
I heard that.	Men muny eşitdim.
There was a problem here.	Bu ýerde mesele bardy.
I have to let you know	Men size habar bermeli
What's next	Indiki näme?
I'll call in the morning.	Irden jaň ederin.
So here we are.	Şonuň üçin biz şu ýerde.
Can anyone help me?	Maňa kömek edip biljek barmy?
That's all we need.	Bu bize gerek zat.
Too much time and money.	Gaty köp wagt we pul.
I saw something	Men bir zady gördüm
There is so much to think about.	Bu pikir üçin köp zat.
I once reported on them here.	Olar hakda bu ýerde bir gezek habar berdim.
He was already there.	Ol öňem bardy.
I have enough money	Mende ýeterlik pul bar
I am very good	Men gaty gowy
I could do nothing	Men hiç zat edip bilmedim
It will never happen.	Bu asla bolmaz.
Of course not today.	Elbetde, bu gün däl.
It may still be possible here.	Bu ýerde henizem mümkin bolup biler.
That can't be the case.	Bu kän bir ýaly bolup bilmez.
I'll call tonight.	Men şu gije jaň ederin.
Must be together.	Bile bolmaly.
It's already three.	Bu eýýäm üç.
I can tell him now	Men oňa häzir aýdyp bilerin
It looks stupid	Bu samsyk ýaly görünýär
I really don't believe it.	Hakykatdanam ynanamok.
Too much.	Gaty köp zat.
An idea came to him	Oňa bir pikir geldi
It could be.	Bu bolup biler.
I can't see you, only me	Men seni görüp bilemok, diňe men
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Uly zat, bolýar.
I said last night	Düýn agşam aýtdym
I have everything	Mende bar zat bar
I was very worried about you	Men sen hakda gaty alada etdim
There is only one problem.	Diňe bir mesele bar.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
I didn't know it would happen	Munuň boljakdygyny bilmedim
He is right.	Ol muny dogry aýdýar.
He is not alone.	Ol ýeke däl.
He can't take me anywhere.	Ol meni hiç ýere alyp bilmez.
I thought about it a lot	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim
I will.	Men ederin.
I must still have helped	Men henizem kömek eden bolmaly
So that’s the first big thing.	Şonuň üçin bu ilkinji uly zat.
I don't have to say that.	Men muny aýtmaly däl.
He asked you several times.	Ol senden birnäçe gezek sorady.
I think it's too early to call.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu jaň etmek üçin entek ir.
Telling him the truth.	Oňa hakykaty aýtmak.
He wanted something else.	Başga bir zat isledi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde ýalňyşlyk ýok.
I haven’t thought about this book in years	Birnäçe ýyl bäri bu kitap hakda pikir etmedim
I've heard it all	Men hemme zady gaty eşitdim
Something bad happened.	Erbet bir zat boldy.
I don’t know why, how or anything else.	Näme üçin, nädip ýa-da başga bir zat bilemok.
I think that will be enough	Bu ýeterlik bolar diýip pikir edýärin
He gave me an idea.	Maňa bir pikir berdi.
I will always do.	Men elmydama ederin.
No need to know anymore.	Indi bilmek hökman däl.
I just want to go home.	Men diňe öýe gitmek isleýärin.
To be difficult.	Kyn bolmak.
I didn't have to go	Men gitmeli däldim
It's easier for me.	Bu meniň üçin has aňsat.
Because time is money.	Sebäbi wagt pul.
He had nothing to say.	Onuň aýdyp biljek zady ýokdy.
As it was a few years ago.	Birnäçe ýyl öňküsi ýaly.
I've been with you for a long time	Men siziň bilen köp wagt boldum
We can't take it.	Biz alyp gidip bilmeris.
There is no life now.	Indi durmuş ýok.
I think it's time.	Meniň pikirimçe wagt geldi.
I was not only beautiful.	Men diňe owadan däldim.
Life is so new.	Durmuş şeýle täze.
Maybe this will help.	Belki bu kömek eder.
I just can't go with anything	Men diňe hiç zat bilen gidip bilemok
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe üns bermeli.
I need some help	Biraz kömek almaly
I question everything	Men hemme zady sorag edýärin
It seems impossible.	Mümkin däl ýaly bolup görünýär.
Of course he hoped.	Elbetde, umyt etdi.
I've only been here a week	Men bu ýerde diňe bir hepde boldum
He never, ever, ever did.	Ol hiç haçan, hiç haçan, hiç haçan etmedi.
He did not want to leave.	Ol gitmek islemedi.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It would be nice for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy bolardy.
I'm happy, but not with everything	Men bagtly, ýöne hemme zat bilen däl
He thought there must be some reason.	Birnäçe sebäp bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
You must be aware that this is not possible	Munuň mümkin däldigini bilýän bolmaly
I think he knew better	Meniň pikirimçe, ol has gowy bilýärdi
I don't think so	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle erbet däldi
This is the first time he has done this.	Bu muny ilkinji gezek etdi.
We have to be fast.	Biz çalt bolmaly.
They were very good to us.	Olar bize gaty gowy boldy.
I almost didn't.	Men diýen ýaly etmedim.
I am often at home	Men köplenç öýde
Now he has done it.	Indi ol muny etdi.
There are probably two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar bolsa gerek.
I think that would be nice.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy bolardy.
Not for the faint of heart.	Munuň ýaly zat üçin däl.
Who are you	Bu sen kim
I promised	Men söz berdim
I'm so scared.	Men gaty gorkýaryn.
Everyone is for their own time.	Her bir adam öz wagty üçin.
You can go there.	Şol ýere gidip bilersiňiz.
I don’t come here often	Men bu ýere köplenç gelenok
You can decide for yourself whether this is a good idea or not.	Bu gowy ýa-da ýok bolsa, özüňiz karar berip bilersiňiz.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
Now he sings.	Indi aýdym aýdýar.
We have two.	Ikimiz bar.
You can think of.	Pikir edip bilersiňiz.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Belki ertir gije.
I didn't want to think about it	Men ol hakda pikir etmek islemedim
No more.	Indi ýok.
Maybe not.	Belki beýle däldi.
I got it and it was great.	Men aldym we gaty gowy.
Sounds great.	Ajaýyp gyzykly ýaly.
I seemed to have it.	Mende bar ýalydy.
Of course three.	Elbetde üç.
I was there for two hours this morning	Şu gün irden ol ýerde iki sagat boldum
Something else.	Başga zat.
I'm very worried.	Men gaty alada edýärin.
There and there.	Ol ýerde we ol ýerde.
OK, very good.	Bolýar, gaty gowy.
I think this will help a lot	Bu gaty uly kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin
Definitely.	Hökman.
I've never done that before	Men muny öň hiç wagt etmedim
Very good, maybe.	Gaty gowy, mümkin.
Makes it interesting.	Gyzykly edýär.
Not at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda däl.
He wanted to know more.	Has köp zady bilmek isledi.
I only knew one thing	Men diňe bir zady bilýärdim
I can't do it here	Men bu ýerde edip bilemok
I think you really need to	Size hakykatdanam gerek diýip pikir edýärin
I can take it with all my life	Bütin durmuş bilen alyp bilerin
You know that.	Muny bilýärsiň.
I never saw him again that weekend	Şol dynç güni ony ýene görmedim
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I thought about it	Men bu hakda pikir etdim
I have one more thing to do today	Şu gün ýene bir etmeli zadym bar
He is there too.	Ol hem şol ýerde.
I can't say anything else now	Indi başga zat aýdyp biljek däl
There are several ways.	Birnäçe ýol bar.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people	Diňe biraz dynç almaly
You have to worry more.	Has köp alada etmeli.
He thought you needed it	Ol saňa gerek diýip pikir etdi
For me, for you	Meniň üçin, seniň üçin
It looks bad.	Bu erbet görünýär.
He needs more.	Oňa has köp zat gerek.
I could not see anything.	Men hiç zady görüp bilmedim.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
You can do other things too.	Başga zatlary hem edip bilersiňiz.
There is a lot going on right now	Häzirki wagtda köp zat bar
I will be here	Men şu ýerde bolaryn
He said there.	Ol şol ýerde diýdi.
He says it will be good, but he knows it.	Gowy boljakdygyny aýdýar, ýöne bilýär.
I don't want that	Men muny islämok
Man, that's great.	Adam, bu gaty gowy.
More for that.	Munuň üçin has köp zat.
Coming home.	Öýüne gelýär.
I can't really talk about it	Men bu hakda hakykatdanam gürläp bilemok
I don't have to go anywhere	Men hiç ýere gitmeli däl
Couldn't be.	Bolup bilmedi.
He is nothing to me.	Ol meniň üçin hiç zat däl.
This is a big mistake.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk.
He was right.	Ol muny dogry aýtdy.
It could be.	Ol bolup biler.
It should be.	Bolmaly.
Who is he	Ol kim.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He could see now.	Ol indi görüp bilýärdi.
I knew it would happen.	Boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
They really don't exist.	Olar hakykatdanam ýok.
There was never a question about it.	Bu hakda hiç haçan sorag ýokdy.
No problem here.	Bu ýerde kynçylyk ýok.
I didn't think about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim.
What happens	Näme bolýar.
I really hope so.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle umyt edýärin.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle etmedi.
I don't think he did that.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol beýle zat etmedi.
They are very interesting.	Olar gaty gyzykly.
I still have it somewhere	Mende henizem bir ýerde bar
The problem will be somewhere else.	Mesele başga bir ýerde bolar.
Someone has to do it.	Kimdir biri etmeli.
I think he knows something	Meniň pikirimçe, ol bir zady bilýär
He didn't want to go far.	Uzak gitmek islemedi.
I am not myself.	Men özüm däl.
And then he comes to her.	Soň bolsa oňa gelýär.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
He had nothing to say, nothing to do.	Onuň aýdyp biljek zady, edip biljek zady ýokdy.
There have also been a number of suggestions.	Şeýle hem, birnäçe teklip geldi.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
I think about it a lot.	Bu hakda köp pikir edýärin.
I need it	Maňa gerek
I could do nothing else	Men başga hiç zat edip bilmedim
No purchase.	Satyn almak ýok.
I knew what he was doing	Munuň näme edýändigini bilýärdim
He stayed there.	Ol şol ýerde galdy.
That was the case last night.	Düýn agşam şeýle boldy.
I couldn't have that.	Mende beýle zat bolup bilmedi.
I didn’t think he would come here immediately	Derrew bu ýere geler öýdemokdym
Nor is it.	Şeýle hem ýok.
Someone did that.	Kimdir biri muny etdi.
He is not alone.	Ol ýeke däl.
He doesn't like it right now.	Ol häzirki wagtda özüni halamaýar.
That would be great for you.	Bu siziň üçin ajaýyp bolardy.
It's not like that.	Munuň ýaly däl.
It will take many years.	Köp ýyl gerek bolar.
How wonderful it is.	Bu nähili ajaýyp.
He already knew that.	Ol muny eýýäm bilýärdi.
I have always been here.	Men elmydama şu ýerde boldum.
What did he do?	Ol näme etdi.
I really have to go	Men hakykatdanam gitmeli
I can tell him more tomorrow	Ertir oňa has köp zat aýdyp bilerin
Because they are nothing.	Sebäbi olar hiç zat däl.
The problem must be something else.	Mesele başga bir zat bolmaly.
It didn't have to go away.	Bu gitmeli däldi.
I've been here for a few weeks	Men bu ýerde birnäçe hepde boldum
I want to live with you	Men seniň bilen durmuş isleýärin
I know, you're not alone.	Bilýän, sen ýeke däl.
This was not a book.	Bu beýle kitap däldi.
I know this is not always the case	Munuň hemişe beýle däldigini bilýärin
He is crazy.	Ol däli.
I can't say anything more.	Mundan başga hiç zat aýdyp biljek däl.
I can't go back yet	Men entek gaýdyp bilemok
I did it completely.	Men düýbünden etdim.
I want to do this	Men bu işi etmek isleýärin
I thought	Men pikir etdim
Me and myself.	Men we ýeke özüm.
Probably more	Mümkin has ähtimal
I don't need it anymore	Munuň üçin indi maňa gerek bolmaz
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolardy.
He, he.	Ol, ol.
Do it, do it.	Muny et, et.
He was right.	Ol dogry aýtdy.
Of course, this is a good thing.	Elbetde, bu gowy zat.
I didn't want to give him anything	Men oňa hiç zat bermek islemedim
This is strange.	Bu geň.
It was not for me.	Bu meniň üçin däldi.
I think there are a few.	Meniň pikirimçe, birnäçe bar.
Of course.	Elbetde.
You have to be here.	Siz şu ýerde bolmaly.
I can't do that	Men muny edip bilemok
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
This is not the case at all.	Bu düýbünden beýle däl.
I know now.	Men indi bilýärin.
He could not speak.	Ol gürläp bilmedi.
This is still the case.	Bu henizem şeýle.
Three.	Üç.
How to do it.	Muny nädip etmeli.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, köplenç däl.
It didn't help him.	Oňa kömek etmedi.
To be a word.	Söz bolmak.
He would be at home.	Ol öýde bolardy.
Who knows next time.	Indiki gezek kim bilýär.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I thought about it myself	Bu mesele hakda özüm pikir etdim
I got a lot of books this week	Şu hepde köp kitap aldym
I don't know enough to say that it is not.	Beýle däldigini aýtmak üçin ýeterlik bilemok.
He got what he wanted	Islän zadyny aldy
What tomorrow	Ertir näme?
He can't do that.	Ol muny edip bilmeýär.
It was nothing more.	Diňe başga zat däldi.
He is the best guy at work right now.	Ol şu wagt iş üçin iň gowy ýigit.
Every week, of course.	Her hepde, elbetde.
I have to agree with him.	Men onuň bilen razy bolmaly.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
And then there was the book	Soň bolsa kitap boldy
It doesn't seem to be.	Aslynda ýok ýaly.
It will be.	Bu bolar.
First time vacation.	Ilkinji gezek dynç almak.
I really want to do that.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle etmek isleýärin.
And then he called, and he really answered.	Soň bolsa jaň etdi, hakykatdanam jogap berdi.
That sounds great.	Bu gaty gowy ýaly.
I saw what happened to him	Men oňa näme bolandygyny gördüm
A few days later I found it very strange	Birnäçe gün soň gaty geň gördüm
This is a strange man.	Bu geň adam.
I totally agree.	Men doly razy.
I hope we can do it next year	Geljek ýyl edip bileris diýip umyt edýärin
There were many reasons for this.	Munuň köp sebäbi bardy.
Not much.	Köp däl.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I knew he was going to call the police	Men onuň polisiýa jaň etjekdigini bilýärdim
Long way to go.	Uzak ýol.
I saw something there	Men ol ýerde bir zady gördüm
It looks really beautiful	Hakykatdanam owadan görünýär
He is no more.	Ol indi ýok.
Too much good can be bad for you.	Gowy zadyň gaty köp bolmagy siziň üçin erbet bolup biler.
You must be crazy.	Sen däli bolmaly.
I bought it myself	Muny özüm satyn aldym
He could not see it.	Ol muny görüp bilmedi.
I always trust you	Men elmydama saňa ynanýaryn
Because it looks like that.	Sebäbi şeýle görünýär.
He could not get the job done or anyone else.	Ol bu işi ýa-da başga birini alyp bilmedi.
It could be with him.	Bu onuň bilen bolup biler.
I didn't think about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim.
Both thought.	Ikisi-de pikir etdi.
This is often the case.	Köplenç şeýle.
I need it this morning	Maňa şu gün irden gerek
I can do that for you	Men muny siziň üçin edip bilerin
I never thought it would be that hard	Aslynda beýle kyn bolar öýdemokdym
Bar.	Bar.
I have to do that	Men muny etmeli
One question.	Bir sorag.
In fact, it is often the case.	Aslynda köplenç beýle däl.
I doubt he can do anything	Onuň hiç zat edip biljekdigine şübhelenýärin
Not at all.	Asla ýok.
They are not lies.	Olar ýalan däl.
Ma'am.	Bu.
It does a great job.	Uly iş edýär.
I called the police.	Men polisiýa jaň etdim.
It's been a few weeks.	Birnäçe hepde boldy.
I didn't see it	Men ony görmedim
I want to be with you.	Men siziň bilen bolmak isleýärin.
I knew he was going to do it	Men muny etjekdigini bilýärdim
He just doesn't come.	Diňe ol gelenok.
There is a lot of damage	Köp zyýan bolýar
It does a lot of good.	Köp zady gowy edýär.
I told you the truth	Men saňa hakykaty aýtdym
It won't be that hard.	Bu beýle kyn bolmaz.
He bought it.	Ol ony satyn aldy.
It can't be.	Ol bolup bilmez.
I don't want to hurt him	Men oňa zyýan bermek islämok
I think he really enjoyed it	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hakykatdanam lezzet aldy
This is still the best way to go.	Bu henizem iň gowy ýol.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Here is the best answer.	Ine iň gowy jogap.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly bolýar.
I think that was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň pikirimçe gaty gowy boldy.
He never did.	Ol hiç haçan etmedi.
This will not be possible for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin mümkin bolmaz.
This will help a lot.	Bu köp kömek eder.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
Very good stuff here.	Bu ýerde gaty gowy zatlar.
I couldn't do that to him.	Men oňa muny edip bilmedim.
I did the right thing	Dogry bir zat etdim
A lot can happen.	Köp zat bolup biler.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
I can do it well	Men muny gowy edip bilerin
Of course not.	Elbetde men däl.
I can get it.	Men ony alyp bilerin.
That's what happens.	Ine, şeýle bolýar.
You have to get it.	Muny almaly.
I thought this idea was great.	Bu pikir ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim.
I'm scared of you right now	Häzirki wagtda senden gorkýaryn
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
It's good to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy zat.
He agreed.	Ol razy boldy.
In fact several times	Aslynda birnäçe gezek
I don't know exactly what to do	Näme etmelidigimi doly bilemok
What did I do? 	Men näme etdim?
'nothing'	'hiç zat'
He and I.	Ol ol we men.
He never called much.	Hiç haçan kän jaň etmedi.
I didn't think of you	Men sen hakda pikir etmedim
That sounds like a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir ýaly.
This is a great opportunity.	Bu ajaýyp mümkinçilik.
She had to get help.	Kömek almaly boldy.
I have to help you	Men size kömek etmeli
She is so young.	Ol şeýle ýaş.
It tells me he wants to be here.	Bu maňa şu ýerde bolmak isleýändigini aýdýar.
Something wrong.	Dogry däl bir zat.
I don't think he knows anything.	Ol hiç zady bilmeýär öýdemok.
As bad as the police.	Polisiýa ýaly erbet.
Something else.	Başga zat.
I have a lot of money	Mende gaty köp pul bar
I'm sure he will.	Etjekdigine ynanýaryn.
I even like it.	Hat-da halaýar.
I will never have enough	Mende hiç wagt ýeterlik bolmaz
There is a month.	Bir aý bar.

I couldn’t just relax and be like myself	Dynç alyp, diňe özüm ýaly bolup bilmedim
I trust you very much	Men saňa uly ynanýaryn
I thought about it.	Men bu barada pikir etdim.
That's more.	Bu has köp.
We are beautiful, bad.	Biz owadan, erbet.
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
I got it once and it took me an hour	Bir gezek aldym, maňa bir sagat gerek boldy
Things like that happen.	Munuň ýaly zatlar bolýar.
A man like you and me	Sen we meniň ýaly adam
This has not always been the case.	Bu hemişe beýle däldi.

Not long.	Uzak däl.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle.
I think this looks great	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy görünýär

Stupid offer.	Samsyk teklip.
Now there is something for that.	Indi munuň üçin bir zat bar.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe şeýle bolar.
They are absolutely right.	Olar düýbünden dogry.

I did it right	Dogry etdim
It would be as good as tomorrow	Ertir ýaly gowy bolardy
In fact, it is impossible.	Aslynda mümkin däl.
I hope you can call me	Maňa jaň edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt edýärin
Not long.	Uzak däl.
I didn’t do very well	Men gaty gowy iş etmedim
This is nothing new.	Bu täze zat däl.
That's all.	Bu hemme zat.
I can't do that to him	Men oňa muny edip bilemok
In fact, I can't say anything else	Aslynda bu hakda başga zat aýdyp biljek däl
Trouble at home.	Öýde kynçylyk.
He was a little worried.	Biraz alada etdi.
I know this for sure	Men muny doly bilýärin
He doesn't want to talk to you.	Ol siziň bilen gürleşmek islemeýär.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
It is very easy to know.	Ony bilmek gaty aňsat.
I can't care less about him tonight	Men bu gije onuň hakda alada edip bilemok
It was like a few days.	Birnäçe gün ýalydy.
You don't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däl.
Good for him.	Onuň üçin gowy.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
Now you and I.	Indi sen we men.
I thought there was nothing that could help me.	Maňa kömek edip biljek zat ýok diýip pikir etdim.
I didn't have to go anywhere	Men hiç ýere gitmeli däldim
Life should not have been so difficult.	Durmuş beýle kyn bolmaly däldi.
It's me.	Bu men.
I think someone else	Başga biri diýip pikir edýärin
I think the timing is great	Wagty gaty gowy diýip pikir edýärin
I couldn't get it anymore.	Men ony indi alyp bilmedim.
Then he fell asleep.	Soň bolsa uklap galdy.
No one told me anything about them.	Hiç kim olar hakda maňa hiç zat aýtmady.
There is nothing else there.	Ol ýerde başga zat ýok.
He was immediately there.	Derrew şol ýerde boldy.
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
He didn't give her time.	Oňa wagt bermedi.
This is really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty erbet.
I should never have hired him	Men ony hiç haçan işe almaly däldim
No one did.	Biri etmedi.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Beýle ajaýyp zat ýokdy.
He is with us.	Ol biziň bilen.
I don't have much.	Mende gaty köp zat ýok.
It's hard to talk to me.	Ol meniň bilen gürleşmek kyn.
I hope you are very happy	Siz gaty bagtly bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin
We have to go.	Biz gitmeli.
I need more	Maňa has köp zat gerek
Maybe that wasn’t enough.	Belki, bu ýeterlik däldi.
Here's how you can do it.	Ine, muny nädip edip bilersiňiz.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Mümkin, ýöne ýeterlik däl.

He knows this, but he does not know how.	Muny bilýär, ýöne nädip bilýändigini bilenok.
I now know why this happened.	Munuň näme üçin bolandygyny indi bilýärin.
Something to do for me.	Meniň üçin etmeli bir zat.
I've seen you many times	Men seni köp gezek gördüm
As long as it takes.	Näçe wagt gerek bolsa.
That's why it's interesting.	Ine, şonuň üçin gyzykly.
Anyone.	Islän adam.
They are close.	Olar ýakyn.
I didn't do that	Men muny etmedim
I shouldn’t have been so crazy	Men beýle däli bolmaly däldim
I will help you.	Men size kömek ederin.
This is short.	Bu gysga.
Good question.	Gowy sorag.
There was no other question.	Mundan başga sorag ýokdy.
I just couldn't sleep	Diňe uklap bilmedim
This has been crazy for the past few months.	Bu soňky birnäçe aý iş bilen däli boldy.
It started with the good news.	Gowy habar bilen başlady.
This is not a big deal.	Bu beýle bir uly zat däl.
He just couldn't help himself.	Ol diňe özüne kömek edip bilmedi.
I didn't know that	Men muny bilmeýärdim
Not so.	Şeýle hem däl.
I can't do that anymore	Men muny indi edip bilemok
It was a wonderful day.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp gün boldy.
It's kind of.	Ol bir hili.
I couldn't be mad at him	Men oňa däli bolup bilmedim
I can't say he didn't either	Ol hem etmedi diýip biljek däl
I don't have enough time	Mende ýeterlik wagt ýok
Each path is different.	Her ýol başga.
I want to talk to him	Men onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty owadan.
He is doing very well.	Ol gaty gowy iş edýär.
Of course we can.	Elbetde edip bileris.

I don’t know how he did it, but he did.	Muny nädip edendigini bilemok, ýöne etdi.
Speak loudly.	Gaty ses bilen aýdyň.
I don't think that's right	Bu dogry däl öýdemok
I want to go with him	Men onuň bilen gitmek isleýärin
He could do nothing for her.	Onuň üçin hiç zat edip bilmedi.
I'm sorry about that	Men muňa gynanýaryn
He couldn't think.	Ol pikir edip bilmedi.
I thought it was weird	Bu geň zat diýip pikir etdim
I believe that	Men muňa ynanýaryn
Tell me.	Aýdyň.
I don't really know.	Aslynda bilemok.
This is not the case for me.	Bu meniň üçin beýle däl.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
I told him almost everything	Men oňa hemme zady diýen ýaly aýtdym
No harm done.	Zyýan ýok.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
He never did.	Ol hiç haçan etmedi.
I had a question.	Maňa bir sorag geldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şonuň ýaly.
They are not going to bother me.	Olar meni biynjalyk etjek däl.
No one knows.	Muny hiç kim bilenok.
There is enough for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin ýeterlik zat bar.
You have to make it easy tonight	Şu gije aňsat etmeli
You are that man	Sen şol adam
There is a mistake here.	Bu ýerde ýalňyşlyk bar.
I hurt you.	Men saňa zyýan berdim.
To be honest	Dogry aýtmak.
I’m not just doing this for me.	Men muny diňe meniň üçin etmeýärin.
I knew it wasn't going to work out	Munuň dogry bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärdim
I hope it doesn't get bad.	Erbet bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
Here	Bu ýere.
The reason is very good.	Munuň sebäbi gaty gowy.
Why did that happen? 	Näme üçin beýle boldy?

He is not very smart.	Ol gaty akylly däl.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
I think he needs time	Meniň pikirimçe, oňa wagty gerek
You didn't have to say a word to him.	Oňa bir söz aýtmak hökman däldi.
There can be no reason.	Sebäbi bolup bilmez.
I think that's great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy.
I knew what was going on there	Men ol ýerde näme bolandygyny bilýärdim
Everything is fast.	Hemme zat çalt bolýar.
What if	Näme bolsa?
Aren't we just like that?	Biz diňe şeýle dälmi?
He thought there must be a reason for that.	Elbetde, munuň bir sebäbi bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
This makes you crazy.	Bu sizi däli edýär.
In fact, it could be.	Aslynda bu bolup biler.

Everything seems possible.	Hemme zat mümkin ýaly.
At that time.	Şol wagt.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň zady, aýdyp bilersiňiz.
Maybe it was never about us.	Belki, bu hiç wagt biz hakda däldi.
He is not right for you.	Ol siziň üçin dogry däl.
Of course, he wanted to go with her.	Elbetde, onuň bilen gitmek isledi.
I could not see the sun	Güni görüp bilmedim
In fact, it was.	Aslynda bardy.
Smart ass	Akylly samsyk.

I paid attention.	Üns berdim.
You have to do it yourself.	Özüňiz etmeli.
He didn't want to think about anything else.	Başga näme hakda pikir etmek islemedi.
It doesn't like anything else.	Bu başga zady halamaýar.
And you don't need anything.	We size hiç zat gerek däl.
Many people could not get it	Köp adam ony alyp bilmedi
There was not much.	Kän zat ýokdy.

An idea came to my mind.	Maňa bir pikir geldi.
I can't get everything	Men hemme zady alyp bilemok
I had no idea.	Pikir ýokdy.
He never told me that.	Ol hiç haçan maňa beýle zat aýtmady.
Maybe I let him know	Belki, oňa habar berdim

That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu başga zat, ýok.

You really have to destroy it.	Siz hakykatdanam ony ýok etmeli.
For or against it.	Munuň üçin ýa-da garşy.

This is another way.	Bu başga bir ýol.
Here is the answer.	Jogap şu.

I am such a person.	Men şeýle adam.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
This is good for them.	Bu olar üçin gowy.
That's exactly what I did.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle boldum.
I saw that he was not alone	Men onuň ýeke däldigini gördüm
It seemed like a bit of a nightmare.	Bu gije birneme bar ýalydy.
No one wants that.	Hiç kim muny islemeýär.
I could not go home	Men öýe gaýdyp bilmedim
I'll be there, near you	Men şol ýerde, size ýakyn ýerde bolaryn
This idea is correct.	Bu pikir dogry.
Long time no see	Köp wagt.
It cannot be an easy question to answer.	Size jogap bermek aňsat sorag bolup bilmez.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
I had to give him something	Men oňa bir zat bermeli boldum
Good.	Gowy.
There is nothing for you.	Ol ýerde siziň üçin hiç zat ýok.
I knew something like this was going to happen	Munuň ýaly bir zadyň boljakdygyny bilýärdim
Really great night	Hakykatdanam ajaýyp gije
I was so stupid	Ajaýyp samsyk boldum
He likes to go there.	Ol ol ýere gitmegi halaýar.
This is not a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat däl.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
I just couldn't do it	Edil şonuň ýaly edip bilmedim
There is something completely wrong about it.	Ol hakda düýbünden dogry däl bir zat bar.
He said two words.	Iki söz aýtdy.
I didn't think much	Men kän pikir etmedim
I can give you one	Men saňa birini berip bilerin
I want to go	Men gitmek isleýärin
This, I think.	Bu, meniň pikirimçe.
It's hard for me to buy anything.	Men hiç zat satyn almak kyn.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
This is serious.	Bu çynlakaý.
I hope this is enough	Bu ýeterlik bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I don't think there is another way.	Başga ýol bar öýdemok.
I was not harmed.	Zyýan görüp bilmedim.
I had to do better.	Men has gowy etmeli boldum.
He did not decide.	Ol karar bermedi.
No more.	Indi ýok.
A slightly beautiful face	Birneme owadan ýüz
I do nothing	Men hiç zat etmeýärin
I did it for the first time	Ilkinji gezek etdim
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
I have been here for the last three days	Men bu ýerde soňky üç gün boldum
It is coming very fast.	Ol gaty çalt gelýär.
I need two more	Maňa ýene iki zat gerek
We have to do something.	Biz bir zat etmeli.
I didn't know it would happen	Munuň boljakdygyny bilmedim
Because it has to be that way.	Sebäbi şeýle bolmaly.
I have a lot	Men köp zat
I can see it.	Men ony görüp bilýärin.
I'm not here to have fun	Men bu ýerde hezil etmek üçin däl
The answer to us.	Bize jogap.
The first two.	Ilkinji ikisi.
In fact, twice before.	Aslynda öň iki gezek.
He just got it right.	Ony diňe dogry ýere aldy.
Surprisingly, there was only one person.	Geň galdy, ýekeje adam bardy.
I didn't see anything	Men hiç zat görmedim
I don't need it yet	Maňa entek gerek däl
I thought he was right	Dogry aýdyp biler öýdüpdim
I knew it was going to be bad news.	Erbet habar boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
He thought it was easy.	Aňsat diýip pikir etdi.
A little strange.	Biraz geň.
Of course, something could happen to him.	Elbetde, oňa bir zadyň bolmagy mümkin.
It seemed to help.	Kömek etjek ýalydy.
I thought it would be	Bolar diýip pikir etdim
I just couldn’t get enough	Diňe ýeterlik bolup bilmedim
I didn't want to know	Men bilmek islemedim
New life in a new place	Täze ýerde täze durmuş
He was not there either.	Ol hem ýokdy.
I hired her two months ago	Men ony iki aý öň işe aldym
I'm sorry about that.	Men oňa gynanýaryn.
It was really fun here.	Bu ýerde hakykatdanam gyzykly boldy.
I really hope so	Hakykatdanam şeýle eder diýip umyt edýärin
I may need it later	Maňa soň gerek bolup biler
I think this will be really interesting	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I still don't know how it happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny henizem bilemok.
He had to give something.	Bir zat bermeli boldy.
He called me.	Ol maňa jaň etdi.
I thought it would be	Bolar öýdüpdim
And then he comes back.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp gelýär.
This is not a guy.	Bu ýigit däl.
In fact, I haven't tried it yet	Aslynda entek synap görmedim
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
He thought it was a difficult thing.	Kyn bir zat diýip pikir etdi.
I can't say how or when it will happen	Nädip ýa-da haçan boljakdygyny aýdyp bilemok
I've never been as smart as you	Men hiç wagt seniň ýaly akylly däldim
I wonder what the future holds	Geljek näme geler diýip pikir edýärin
I haven't thought about it for months	Birnäçe aý bäri ol hakda pikir etmedim
There.	Ol ýerde.
I didn't see the time	Men wagty görmedim
I think this will really help	Bu hakykatdanam kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin
This is for you	Bu seniň üçin
Just for us.	Diňe biziň üçin.
This led to him.	Bu bolsa ony özüne alyp bardy.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki, munuň sebäbi ýokdy.
We can do it twice.	Iki gezek edip bileris.
Of course it is.	Elbetde şeýle.
I could do it all day	Men muny bütin gün edip bilýärdim
It's too much and right.	Ol gaty köp we dogry.
That will be the case.	Şeýle bolar.
He is out now.	Ol indi çykdy.
She looks beautiful.	Ol owadan görünýär.
Of course, he was not alone.	Elbetde, ol ýerde ýeke däldi.
Interesting for them.	Olar üçin gyzykly.
Ma'am.	Bu.
In fact, you can see it now.	Aslynda muny şu wagt görüp bilersiňiz.
It's hard to think.	Muny pikir etmek kyn.
This is very new to me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty täze.
We can't both talk.	Ikimizem gürläp bilmeris.
I had a lot.	Mende köp bardy.
She sings loudly.	Gaty ses bilen aýdym aýdýar.
I think it was good.	Gowy boldy diýip pikir edýärin.
I was not good enough for him	Men oňa ýeterlik däldim
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people	Diňe biraz dynç almaly
He is with us now.	Ol häzir biziň bilen.
I was not smart.	Men akylly däldim.
It's too fast.	Bu gaty çalt.
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
It won’t be fun and it won’t be easy.	Bu gyzykly bolmaz we aňsat bolmaz.
I didn’t do it to be bad	Erbet bolmak üçin etmedim
All day, every day.	Bütin gün, her gün.
Must have its own thing	Öz zady bolmaly
I needed to, but now I don't	Zerur etdim, ýöne indi ýok
I really didn't know	Men hakykatdanam bilmedim
Okay, maybe not at all.	Bolýar, belki düýbünden bolmaz.
I had nothing better	Mende has gowy zat ýokdy
This is what happened here.	Bu ýerde şeýle boldy.
I think that's right	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry
Nothing will happen here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat bolmaz.
Of course, he had help.	Elbetde, oňa kömek bardy.
I got it.	Men ony aldym.
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
I know enough	Men muny ýeterlik bilýärin
That's what happened.	Şeýle boldy.
I heard it once	Men ony bir gezek eşitdim
I was not good enough for it	Men munuň üçin ýeterlik däldim
I knew it	Men muny bilýärdim
Because it is.	Sebäbi şeýle.
Which way to go?	Haýsy ýol bolmaly.
This is his job.	Bu onuň işi.
I never had.	Mende asla ýokdy.
I couldn’t say she was really beautiful	Men ony hakykatdanam owadan diýip bilmedim
This is bad.	Bu erbet.
Okay, that looks pretty bad.	Bolýar, bu gaty erbet görünýär.
Probably not for the answer.	Belki, jogap üçin ýok.
I couldn't do anything else	Başga zat edip bilmedim
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Of course not.	Elbetde dogry däl.
I thought about it a little more	Bu hakda ýene birneme pikir etdim
I know a lot	Men köp zady bilýärin
In fact, it's not even close.	Aslynda bu ýakyn hem däl.
I knew it was enough	Men muny ýeterlik bilýärdim
It's not you	Bu sen däl
Those two guys are really good.	Şol iki ýigit hakykatdanam gowy.
Same voice	Şol bir ses.
I think it could be another year	Başga bir ýyl bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin
Now he can go home.	Indi öýe gaýdyp biler.
I just want to be here	Men diňe şu ýerde bolmak isleýärin
I really want to go home	Men hakykatdanam öýe gitmek isleýärin
There were two ways to do this.	Bu hakda iki ýol ýokdy.
He seemed to know a lot.	Köp zady bilýän ýalydy.
Everyone has what they want.	Her kimiň isleýän zady bar.
I do this with great care	Muny şeýle uly üns bilen edýärin
Just to say something.	Diňe bir zat aýtmak üçin.
He could not help it.	Ol muňa kömek edip bilmedi.
I can't hire this.	Men muny işe alyp bilemok.
I didn't know what happened to me	Mende näme bolandygyny bilmedim
There was time for that.	Munuň üçin wagty bardy.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
He was never.	Ol hiç wagt beýle däldi.
This time it was the same.	Bu gezek hem şeýle boldy.
He did not do that.	Muny etmedi.
I rested	Men dynç aldym
Now everyone can come back.	Indi her kim gaýdyp biler.
Now it's just me.	Indi diňe men.
Every day is a different day for everyone.	Her gün hemmeler üçin başga gün.
I gave him something.	Men oňa bir zat berdim.
I totally agree with that.	Men muňa doly razy.
I was not ready for it	Men oňa taýyn däldim
Maybe this is not necessary.	Belki, bu zerur däl.
With great.	Ajaýyp bilen.
There was another issue	Başga bir mesele bardy
It is not yet available.	Häzirki wagtda ol entek ýok.
It was so bad.	Bu gaty erbet boldy.
I have to tell him.	Men oňa aýtmaly.
He left this morning.	Ol şu gün irden gitdi.
This is good, I think.	Bu meniň pikirimçe gowy.
I don't know any better.	Men mundan gowy bilemok.
Of course he had to give something.	Elbetde, bir zat bermeli boldy.
That could be great.	Bu uly bolup biler.
Bad idea.	Erbet pikir.
He does it for her.	Ol muny onuň üçin edýär.
The problem is there.	Mesele şol ýerde.
Maybe not.	Belki bolmaz.
That is why we.	Şonuň üçin biz.
Just being with me.	Diňe meniň bilen bolmak.
I will be here.	Men şu ýerde bolaryn.
I was a little worried.	Biraz alada etdim.
I didn't have to go that far	Men beýle gitmeli däldim
I will call him every day	Men oňa her gün jaň ederin
I could no longer be alone with him	Men indi onuň bilen ýeke bolup bilmedim
I've been everywhere.	Men hemme ýerde boldum.
I'm calling, nothing.	Men jaň edýärin, hiç zat.
I am very difficult with everyone.	Men hemmeler bilen gaty kyn.
It should be like this.	Munuň ýaly bolmaly.
He is there, here.	Ol şol ýerde, şu ýerde.
It's hard to see.	Muny görmek gaty kyn.
Definitely not.	Hökman beýle däl.
I know what he wants	Men onuň isleýän zadyny bilýärin
This is hope, perhaps.	Bu umyt, belki.
Maybe not.	Belki ýok.
I didn't do that.	Men muny etmedim.
There is so much against us.	Bize garşy gaty köp zat bar.
This can make someone crazy.	Bu kimdir birini däli edip biler.
I can't take it anymore	Men muny indi alyp bilemok
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
He knows what to do.	Näme etmelidigini bilýär.
He thought he was very smart.	Ol gaty akylly diýip pikir etdi.
I'm sure he'll agree	Razy boljakdygyna ynanýaryn
He knew her well enough to know that.	Ol muny bilmek üçin ony gowy bilýärdi.
You know he can.	Biljekdigini bilýärsiň.
There is a good reason to think so.	Beýle pikir etmegiň gowy sebäbi bar.
You don't have to answer	Jogap bermek hökman däl
Which one.	Haýsy.
They were not home yet.	Olar henizem öýde däldi.
I heard what happened last night	Düýn agşam näme bolandygyny eşitdim
We need these things.	Bize bu zatlar gerek.
I told you so	Men muny size aýtdym
Oh no, no, no.	Aý ýok, ýok, ýok.
I immediately told him what had happened	Men oňa näme bolandygyny derrew aýtdym
I could tell he didn't want to say it.	Men onuň aýtmak islemeýändigini aýdyp bilýärdim.
It should be, but it is not.	Bolmaly, ýöne beýle däl.
I knew it	Men muny bilýärdim
The day has come.	Gün geldi.
I must have thought about it.	Men bu barada pikir eden bolmaly.
I'm not really.	Men aslynda beýle däl.
This too.	Bu hem.
I got a little and I want a lot	Biraz aldym we köp zat isleýärin
He could see it, but he couldn't go.	Ol muny görüp bilýärdi, ýöne baryp bilmedi.
I can't tell you what to do	Näme etmelidigimi aýdyp bilemok
Not so with this book.	Bu kitap bilen beýle däl.
Ma'am.	Bu.
Of course he knew that.	Elbetde, muny bilýärdi.
Just what.	Diňe näme.
Worse.	Has erbet.
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men munuň dogry däldigini aýtdym
I don't think there are two ways to do that	Bu hakda iki ýol ýokdy öýdýän
Everything will be clear.	Hemme zat aýdyň bolar.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
I didn't want to ask any questions	Men hiç hili sorag bermek islemedim
I can recommend this myself.	Muny özüm maslahat berip bilerin.
He wants what he wants.	Islän zadyny isleýär.
This can't be helped.	Bu kömek edip bolmaz.
I didn't want to talk to him	Men onuň bilen gürleşmek islemedim
I haven't seen anything yet	Men henizem hiç zady görüp bilmedim
It was not beautiful.	Owadan däldi.
I can't think of anything more interesting.	Has gyzykly zat hakda pikir edip bilemok.
We have to go.	Biz gitmeli.
I'm very good at it	Men muňa gaty gowy
Too many.	Gaty köp.
Everyone is young.	Hemmeler ýaş.
I could not go anywhere	Men hiç ýere gidip bilmedim
I don't know anything about you	Men sen hakda hiç zat bilemok
I didn't do it right	Dogry etmedim
I can borrow and lend you	Men karz alyp, size karz berip bilerin
I think that's about it.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hakda.
He had a daughter with him.	Onuň bilen bir gyz bardy.
This has been a bit good before.	Bu öň birneme gowy boldy.
The thought did not bother him.	Bu pikir ony biynjalyk etmedi.
He tried to do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly etjek boldy.
It's hard for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin kyn.
It happened, but not completely.	Bu şeýle boldy, ýöne doly däldi.
I have enough trouble	Mende ýeterlik kynçylyk bar
I have been thinking the same thing for weeks.	Birnäçe hepde bäri şol bir zady pikir edýärin.
I got everything today.	Şu gün hemme zady aldym.
I know a little.	Men birneme bilýärin.
I didn't think he could see me completely	Ol meni doly görüp biler öýdemokdym
I was no longer that girl	Men indi ol gyz däldim
And then we can tell.	Soň bolsa aýdyp bileris.
It must be difficult.	Bu kyn bolmaly.
You have to be smart.	Akylly bolmaly.
I don't believe that	Men muňa gaty ynanamok
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gaty bir zat.
I'm scared of something young	Men ýaş zat üçin gorkýaryn
It's not very close.	Bu gaty ýakyn däl.
I called about it several times.	Bu barada birnäçe gezek jaň etdim.
Only once.	Diňe bir gezek.
I still have to	Mende henizem bolmaly
Just to give you an idea.	Diňe bir pikir bermek üçin.
That will never happen to me.	Meniň üçin asla beýle bolmaz.
I'm sure it will.	Boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
Twice.	Iki gezek.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
Bad.	Erbet.
I think well.	Gowy pikir edýärin.
He doesn't want me.	Ol meni islemeýär.
It doesn't seem right.	Dogry däl ýaly.
It was not good.	Gowy däldi.
Really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy.
No longer a problem.	Indi mesele däl.
It's tonight.	Bu şu gije.
Not a good idea.	Gowy pikir däl.
He couldn't think of anything.	Ol hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilmedi.
The right age.	Dogry ýaş.
I hope this helped you.	Bu size kömek etdi diýip umyt edýärin.
We can go back.	Biz gaýdyp bileris.
He thought it was not really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy däl diýip pikir etdi.
It's not about them.	Bu olar hakda däl.
It seemed very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn ýalydy.
There was no other good reason.	Mundan başga hiç hili gowy sebäp ýokdy.
A maximum of two months	Iň köp iki aý
I want to talk to him	Men onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
Of course.	Elbetde.
I didn’t do much at the time	Men şol wagt kän bir zat etmedim
I could see it all.	Men hemmesini görüp bilýärdim.
This is crazy.	Bu, däli.
It will not be easy to say.	Muny aýtmak aňsat bolmaz.
It's bad, it's bad.	Ol erbet, gaty erbet.
He answered.	Jogap berdi.
I'm so glad to see you	Men sizi görüp gaty begenýärin
He can't go.	Ol gidip bilmeýär.
I'll do it right	Dogry ederin
I was very close.	Men gaty ýakyn boldum.
He told me he would be happy.	Ol maňa bagtly boljakdygyny aýtdy.
It was fast.	Ol çalt boldy.
A lot of people know that.	Köp adam muny bilýär.
And he thinks that's a good thing.	We bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýär.
In fact, many people say that.	Aslynda, köp adam muny aýdýar.
I think there is something here	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýerde bir zat bar
I knew it right away.	Men muny derrew bilýärdim.
It could be.	Bu bolup biler.
I didn't think so	Men muny pikir etmedim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu ýerde bolmaly.
That alone was not enough.	Munuň özi ýeterlik däldi.
I was not a good person	Men gowy adam däldim
Call the police	Polisiýa jaň etmek
I didn’t do anything to make myself do that	Özümi beýle etmek üçin hiç zat etmedim
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
I can give you a try	Size synap görüp bilerin
I think we can see that here.	Muny şu ýerde görüp bileris diýip pikir edýärin.
This is often not the case.	Köplenç beýle däl.
I could be someone else	Men başga adam bolup bilerin
This is really difficult.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn.
This year he was alone.	Bu ýyl ol ýeke boldy.
I just want you tonight	Diňe şu gije seni isleýärin
You are happy	Sen bagtly.
It will be a little more.	Bu birneme has köp bolar.
He could not sleep.	Ol uklap bilmedi.
I tried to do it myself.	Muny özüm etjek boldum.
She had to go home.	Öýüne gitmeli boldy.
I'm not good	Men gowy däl
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
I can't sleep anymore	Indi uklap bilemok
There were two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bardy.
I don't need money	Maňa pul gerek däl
Not just why, just how.	Näme üçin däl, diňe nädip.
It's about a girl.	Bu gyz hakda.
I had to destroy something	Bir zady ýok etmeli boldum
I'm not good.	Men gowy däl.
I call the police.	Men polisiýa jaň edýärin.
I don't know what's going on here	Bu ýerde näme bardygyny bilemok
Someone else is with him.	Başga biri onuň bilen.
I always knew the truth	Men hemişe hakykaty bilýärdim
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
Must do.	Etmeli.
You can go back there	Şol ýere gaýdyp bilersiňiz
Work.	Iş.
It's beautiful.	Bu owadan.
Himself, but not himself.	Özi, ýöne özi däl.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
It wasn't so good yesterday.	Düýn bir gün beýle gowy däldi.
It can't be that way.	Beýle bolup bilmez.
It was very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly boldy.
I have everything.	Mende hemme zat bar.
I just hope it is here	Diňe şu ýerde diýip umyt edýärin
Beautiful, beautiful that everyone wants.	Her kimiň isleýän owadan, owadan.
I already have it together	Mende eýýäm bilelikde bar
I was worried about you	Men sen hakda alada etdim
What he knows is here, now, and now.	Onuň bilýän zady şu ýerde, şu wagt we şu wagt.
You have what you want	Seniň islän zadyň bar
No one will know that this exists.	Munuň bardygyny hiç kim bilmez.
I can't do anything about it	Men onuň bilen hiç zat edip bilemok
Maybe it's time to call again.	Belki, ýene jaň etmegiň wagty geldi.
Now.	Häzir.
I gave you a book.	Men saňa kitap berdim.
We can't do that.	Muny edip bilmeris.
Strange sound.	Geň ses.
He wants to see me.	Ol meni görmek isleýär.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
I think it should be new	Meniň pikirimçe, täze bolmaly
It is absolutely right to do so.	Muny etmek düýbünden dogry.
He said you could be right.	Dogry aýdyp bilersiňiz diýdi.
This is not really a bad thing.	Bu aslynda erbet däl.
I could not see anything.	Men hiç zat görüp bilmedim.
Of course, the summer is wonderful.	Elbetde, tomus ajaýyp.
Everything seemed easy to me.	Hemme zat maňa aňsat ýalydy.
It takes several hours.	Birnäçe sagat gerek.
And then he did something about it.	Soň bolsa bu barada bir zat etdi.
I know, I can see you	Bilýän, seni görüp bilýärin
I don't know anything, I didn't do anything	Hiç zat bilemok, hiç zat etmedim
It was like the right time.	Dogry wagt ýalydy.
It's great for everyone.	Ol hemmeler üçin gaty gowy.
He is not as young as before.	Ol öňküsi ýaly ýaş däl.
I never knew what had happened to him	Men onuň bilen näme bolandygyny asla bilmeýärdim
I really care about you	Men hakykatdanam seni alada edýärin
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
It could be both.	Bu ikisi hem bolup biler.
It turned out well.	Gowy çykdy.
It's weird.	Ol geň.
I care about him the most	Men ony iň köp alada edýärin
This time he was right, very right.	Bu gezek ol dogry aýtdy, gaty dogry.
Very young	Köp ýaş.
I don't know what he's doing there.	Men onuň ol ýerde näme edýändigini bilemok.
This will not be good.	Bu gowy bolmaz.
It was hard for me to get this.	Muny almak maňa kyn boldy.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
I do it almost every day	Men her gün diýen ýaly edýärin
Until then.	Oňa çenli.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It was great for that.	Munuň üçin gaty gowy boldy.
The answer, of course.	Jogap, elbetde.
He didn't even ask questions.	Ol hatda sorag bermedi.
This is what happens.	Bolýan zat şu.
I can't do that often	Men muny köplenç edip bilemok
Maybe you can do that.	Belki muny edip bilersiňiz.
Maybe it helped	Belki kömek eden bolsa gerek
I didn't want to think about anything	Bir zatlar hakda pikir etmek islemedim
Good and bad things.	Gowy we erbet zatlar.
I just had to go	Men diňe gitmeli boldum
It was very hard against him.	Oňa garşy gaty boldy.
I don't know what to do about it.	Munuň näme etmelidigini bilemok.
I can say that now	Muny häzir aýdyp bilerin
I've only seen it twice.	Men muny diňe iki gezek gördüm.
It will not be so.	Ol beýle bolmaz.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It was not beautiful.	Bu owadan däldi.
It was so crazy.	Bu gaty däli boldy.
I'm so scared.	Men gaty gorkýaryn.
I think that's the right word	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry söz
I'll take care of that	Men muňa alada ederin
No moon.	Aý ýok.
I can't get there yet	Men entek ol ýere baryp bilemok
I called several times	Men birnäçe gezek jaň etdim
There must be someone.	Kimdir biri bolmaly.
I want to be closer to him	Men oňa has ýakyn bolmak isleýärin
I can sleep easily now	Men indi aňsat uklap bilýärin
The man is right.	Adam dogry aýdýar.
Right now.	Ine, edil şu wagt.
Of course, he helped her.	Elbetde, oňa kömek etdi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Something with me.	Meniň bilen bir zat.
This will never happen.	Bu hiç wagt bolmaz.
I think you should do that	Muny etmeli diýip pikir edýärin
There is nothing really new.	Hakykatdanam täze zat ýok.
He did not.	Ol etmedi.
I'm not good for you	Men siziň üçin gowy däl
I was stupid, now I'm gone	Men samsyk boldum, indi ýok boldy
He still had a chance.	Oňa henizem mümkinçilik bardy.
I heard him call me.	Onuň maňa jaň edýändigini eşitdim.
This is the last.	Bu iň soňky.
Maybe I didn't do it like you did	Mümkin, muny seniň ýaly etmedim
This was not the worst.	Bu iň erbet däldi.
It was for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin boldy.
I hope he does well	Men oňa gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
Nice to meet you	Seni görmek gaty gowy.
I don't really know.	Aslynda bilemok.
He will have to answer me.	Ol maňa jogap bermeli bolar.
I can't do that for you	Men muny seniň üçin edip bilemok
I care about myself	Men özüm hakda alada edýärin
Bad thing, of course, but help came.	Erbet bir zat, elbetde, ýöne kömek geldi.
No one wanted to be here.	Hiç kim bu ýerde bolmak islemedi.
I never do that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmeýärin.
In your opinion, this will be easier.	Siziň pikiriňizçe bu aňsat bolar.
A year ago it would have been easy	Bir ýyl ozal aňsat bolardy
It must be difficult.	Kyn bolmaly.
No work today.	Bu gün iş ýok.
I want this a lot	Men muny köp isleýärin
This is a complete lie.	Bu düýbünden ýalan.
I was very worried about him	Men ol hakda gaty alada etdim
There was no other good reason.	Mundan başga hiç hili gowy sebäp ýokdy.
And then the work took him away again.	Soň bolsa iş ony ýene alyp gitdi.
He was like another man.	Ol başga bir adam ýalydy.
I can give it to you.	Men saňa berip bilerin.
This is a big deal.	Bu uly mesele.
That may seem easy.	Bu aňsat ýaly bolup biler.
So the truth of something is not its own truth.	Şonuň üçin bir zadyň hakykaty öz hakykaty däl.
This did not help.	Bu kömek etmedi.
Just wonderful things.	Diňe ajaýyp zatlar.
I hope there is something good for me	Meniň üçin gowy zat bar diýip umyt edýärin
I want to talk to you about it.	Bu hakda size gürleşmek isleýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Muny şeýle etmeli.
We can't help you.	Biz size kömek edip bilmeris.
I think this is the case	Meniň pikirimçe, bu iş şu
it's over now	indi boldy.
I told him the truth	Men oňa hakykaty aýtdym
I was myself again	Men ýene özüm boldum
This is really nothing.	Bu hakykatdanam hiç zat däl.
I am just a man.	Men diňe bir adam.
Not difficult things.	Kyn zatlar däl.
He did not know that such a thing existed.	Munuň ýaly zadyň bardygyny bilmeýärdi.
Good and bad things.	Gowy we erbet zatlar.
I could not tell.	Men aýdyp bilmedim.
This did not answer.	Bu jogap bermedi.
Crazy, man, crazy.	Däli, adam, däli.
He needs it.	Oňa mätäç.
I saw it here.	Men ony şu ýerde gördüm.
I'm afraid to call her.	Men oňa jaň etmekden gorkýaryn.
This is a smart job.	Bu akylly iş.
That can't be the case anymore.	Mundan beýläk beýle bolup bilmez.
I trust you	Men saňa ynanýaryn.
Right here, right now.	Edil şu ýerde, edil şu wagt.
Police arrived at home to let her know.	Polisiýa oňa habar bermek üçin öýüne geldi.
They were never close.	Olar hiç haçan ýakyn däldi.
So they have to be both themselves and themselves.	Şonuň üçin olar hem özi, hem özi bolmaly.
I saw it.	Men muny gördüm.
Only tonight.	Diňe şu gije.
We can still get there.	Biz henizem ol ýere baryp bileris.
I still know who will know how long	Kimiň näçe wagt biljekdigini henizem bilýärin
I thought of you today	Bu gün sen hakda pikir etdim
I haven't seen you in a long time	Men seni köp wagt bäri görmedim
I just don’t believe it	Men diňe ynanamok
Of course not about you.	Elbetde sen hakda däl.
I heard well.	Gowy eşitdim.
Something is wrong here.	Bu ýerde bir zat dogry däl.
I'm sure everything will be fine	Hemme zadyň gowy boljakdygyna ynanýaryn
I think this should be a good thing	Bu gowy zat bolmaly diýip pikir edýärin
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat.
I think he will.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şeýle eder.
Life is hard here.	Bu ýerde durmuş kyn.
Such a strange thing for me.	Meniň üçin şeýle geň zat.
In fact, there is nothing wrong with that.	Hakykatdanam, indi ýalňyşlyk ýok.
It's really weird.	Aslynda gaty geň.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
Just tell me.	Diňe aýdyň.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke-täk däldi.
There.	Ol ýerde.
No one knew he was here.	Hiç kim onuň şu ýerde bolandygyny bilmeýärdi.
It's money.	Bu pul.
Oh no, never.	Aý ýok, hiç haçan.
I just can't call him	Men oňa diňe jaň edip bilemok
This has been going on for some time.	Bu birneme wagt bäri gelýär.
I asked him a lot of questions	Men oňa köp sorag berdim
Maybe not at all!	Belki asla garşy bolmaz!
We are not there yet.	Biz entek ol ýerde ýok.
He also knew the truth.	Ol hakykaty hem bilýärdi.
It could be.	Bu bolup biler.
I was not at all surprised	Men düýbünden geň görmedim
I think that made it very interesting	Meniň pikirimçe, muny gaty gyzykly etdi
I have several calls.	Mende birnäçe jaň bar.
I'll be everything to you	Men saňa hemme zat bolaryn
He may have done that.	Muny eden bolmagy mümkin.
I found it very strange	Men muny gaty geň gördüm
He got it.	Ol aldy.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
He decided he had to go.	Kömek, gitmeli boljakdygyna karar berdi.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
I always think about it	Men bu hakda hemişe pikir edýärin
Not a good day.	Gowy gün däl.
That will be the case.	Şeýle bolar.
I didn’t see him much last year	Geçen ýyl men ony kän görmedim
I thought it was a lot.	Bu köp zat diýip pikir etdim.
Everyone knows this is not true.	Munuň dogry däldigini hemmeler bilýär.
I don't know how	Nädip bilemok
He hasn't done anything twice yet.	Ol henizem iki gezek hiç zat etmedi.
This is a concern.	Bu alada.
Because you have to do it right.	Sebäbi muny dogry etmeli.
In fact, it is possible that this happened.	Aslynda munuň bolup geçen bolmagy ähtimal.
Too much, too fast.	Gaty köp, gaty çalt.
You can call him and see.	Oňa jaň edip görüp bilersiňiz.
I don't know about that.	Men beýle zatlar hakda bilemok.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
Yesterday again	Düýn ýene
You don't have to worry about me.	Men hakda alada etmeli däl.
You don't have to do that.	Beýle etmeli däl.
She is another girl now.	Ol indi başga bir gyz.
Bad day with bad things	Erbet zatlar bilen erbet gün
I can't do that, not right now	Men muny edip bilemok, häzir däl
This or that.	Bu ýa-da biz.
I don't believe that	Men muňa ynanamok
I know that	Men bu barada bilýärin
Of course he came back to help.	Elbetde, kömek etmek üçin gaýdyp geldi.
Long way to go.	Uzak ýol.
I still can't see anything	Men henizem hiç zady görüp bilemok
I think that's a good question.	Bu gowy sorag diýip pikir edýärin.
Which one.	Haýsy.
I was in that house	Men şol öýde boldum
I was crazy	Men däli boldum
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
He may have hoped long ago	Köp wagt mundan ozal umyt eden bolmagy mümkin
It will be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolar.
He is right.	Dogry aýdýar.
There or not.	Ol ýerde ýa-da ýok.
I always think so	Men elmydama şeýle pikir edýärin
Actually a week later	Aslynda bir hepde soň
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
It seems.	Ol görünýär.
They have to be everywhere.	Olar hemme ýerde bolmaly.
I'm sorry about that	Men oňa gynanýaryn
It seemed the most interesting.	Iň gyzykly ýalydy.
It told me a lot.	Bu maňa köp zady aýtdy.
There were a lot of people there	Ol ýerde köp adam bardy
I will not be happy anymore.	Men mundan beýläk bagtly bolmaz.
It takes time.	Oňa wagt gerek.
I know what he's doing	Men onuň näme edýändigini bilýärin
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
He is a wonderful man.	Ol ajaýyp adam.
He made many decisions.	Köp karar berdi.
I need some time	Maňa biraz wagt gerek
This book destroyed me.	Bu kitap meni ýok etdi.
They are both really young.	Ikisi-de hakykatdanam gaty ýaş.
I thought it was weird	Bu geň zat diýip pikir etdim
I'm questioning everything now.	Men häzir hemme zady sorag edýärin.
I don't want anything	Men hiç zat islämok
Maybe more now.	Belki indi has köp.
There was no time for that.	Munuň üçin wagt ýokdy.
I can’t even think about it	Bu hakda hatda pikir edip bilemok
That should be interesting!	Bu gyzykly bolmaly!
Bad, just bad.	Erbet, diňe erbet.
I was not like that	Men olar ýaly zat däldim
I want to do that	Men muny etmek isleýärin
I could only speak for myself.	Men diňe özüm üçin gürläp bilýärdim.
He is not.	Ol ýok.
I can only tell you that	Men muny diňe size aýdyp bilerin
And then one.	Soň bolsa bir.
Not good at all.	Elbetde gowy däl.
Not too fast.	Gaty çalt däl.
This did not bother him.	Bu ony biynjalyk etmedi.
I think the idea seems very strange	Meniň pikirimçe, pikir gaty geň görünýär
Not much, now.	Kän däl, indi.
That would be nice.	Bu birneme gowy bolardy.
She is a girl.	Ol gyz.
I can tell you a lot	Muny size köp zat aýdyp bilerin
Maybe not right now, but it will.	Belki, edil häzir däl, ýöne şeýle eder.
I have done this many times	Men muny köp gezek etdim
He did what he really needed to do.	Ol hakykatdanam zerur zady etdi.
That's what he told me.	Ine, ol maňa aýtdy.
This is also the easiest week.	Bu hem iň aňsat hepde.
Just like us.	Edil biziň ýaly.
Serious, very easy and very good.	Çynlakaý, gaty aňsat we gaty gowy.
Good.	Gowy.
To everyone.	Her kimiň özüne.
I had to go somewhere else	Men düýbünden başga ýere gitmeli boldum
This seems to be the idea.	Bu pikir ýaly bolup görünýär.
He will do it.	Muny eder.
I do not know when and how	Haçan we nädip bilemok
If good.	Gowy bolsa.
I always think of him	Men ol hakda hemişe pikir edýärin
I want to be able to do that.	Muny edip bilmek isleýärin.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
It really did exist.	Bu hakykatdanam bardy.
It was not a good day.	Bu gowy gün däldi.
This is not what he needs now.	Bu oňa häzir zerur zat däldi.
Another time.	Başga bir gezek.
I know it's not the police.	Polisiýa däldigini bilýärin.
It was really bad for a few days.	Birnäçe gün hakykatdanam erbet boldy.
I think you should go home now	Meniň pikirimçe, indi öýe gitmeli
It's hard to answer.	Oňa jogap bermek kyn.
You still have to think twice	Entek ýene iki pikir etmeli
Now that may be the case.	Indi bu mesele bolup biler.
I need to be more with him.	Men onuň bilen has köp bolmaly.
I think this looks great	Bu gaty gowy görünýär diýip pikir edýärin
Whatever you want	Islän zady.
This is a long, strange time.	Bu köp wagt, geň wagt.
He can't speak.	Ol gürläp bilmeýär.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
I offered him money, but he said no	Men oňa pul teklip etdim, ýöne ol ýok diýdi
I know he will agree	Men onuň razy boljakdygyny bilýärin
It will not be right.	Dogry bolmaz.
I have to be fast.	Men çalt bolmaly.
I didn't care	Men bu barada alada etmedim
Things like that.	Munuň ýaly zatlar.
I can't see that this could be bad for you	Munuň siziň üçin erbet bolup biljekdigini görüp bilemok
No time now.	Indi wagt ýok.
It never makes sense to me.	Bu meniň üçin hiç wagt pikir etmeýär.
I am a good person.	Men gowy adam.
There is no reason.	Sebäbi ýok.
I had one.	Mende biri bardy.
I still have.	Mende henizem bar.
It makes me crazy.	Bu meni däli edýär.
He can help you.	Ol size kömek edip biler.
He said he would.	Etjekdigini aýtdy.
I know he's not anywhere.	Men onuň hiç ýerde däldigini bilýärin.
I couldn't see him, but he was there	Men ony görüp bilmedim, ýöne ol şol ýerde
He is too young to know such a thing.	Ol beýle zady bilmek üçin gaty ýaş.
Of course to give and to give.	Elbetde bermek we bermek.
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
They still exist.	Olar henizem bar.
I just thought, you know.	Diňe pikir etdim, bilýärsiň.
I called several places	Birnäçe ýere jaň etdim
What happened was not the case.	Näme boldy, beýle däldi.
Bar.	Bar.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Of course, he is right.	Elbetde, dogry aýdýar.
You, me, can't do that alone.	Sen, men, muny ýeke edip bilmeris.
I still want to.	Men henizem isleýärin.
This is exactly what happened here and there.	Bu edil şu ýerde we şu ýerde.
He had no choice.	Oňa mümkinçilik ýokdy.
I will help you here.	Men size şu ýerde kömek ederin.
So be prepared.	Şonuň üçin taýyn bolmaly.
I told her it would be fun	Men oňa gyzykly boljakdygyny aýtdym
There are more faces.	Has köp ýüz görünýär.
I don't know anything about this issue.	Bu mesele hakda hiç zat bilemok.
I’m not here to enjoy	Men lezzet almak üçin bu ýerde däl
I have to tell you.	Men saňa aýtmaly.
I just couldn’t tell him	Men oňa diňe aýdyp bilmedim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň edip biljek zady.
He was ready for it.	Ol muňa taýyn boldy.
This seems to be true.	Bu dogry ýaly.
I didn't want to talk anymore	Indi gürleşmek islemedim
He could not do that.	Muny edip bilmedi.
Not a complete person.	Doly adam däl.
Almost time.	Wagt diýen ýaly.
We can't see that.	Biz muny görüp bilmeris.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
No one told us anything.	Hiç kim bize hiç zat aýtmady.
The call came.	Jaň geldi.
Not surprising, but good.	Geň däl, ýöne gowy.
He wanted me here.	Ol meni şu ýerde isledi.
I don't know what happened to me.	Mende näme bolandygyny bilemok.
We can also try.	Şeýle hem synap görüp bileris.
There is someone there.	Ol ýerde kimdir biri bar.
This is great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
It's never about anyone else.	Hiç haçan başga adam hakda däl.
I knew it was crazy	Munuň ony däli edendigini bilýärdim
This is really the only answer.	Bu hakykatdanam ýeke-täk jogap.
This will definitely help.	Bu, elbetde, kömek eder.
Bad news.	Erbet habar.
What an interesting man.	Nähili gyzykly adam.
Of course, he was not there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde ýokdy.
I don't know much about it.	Men bu hakda kän bilemok.
Not much, not necessarily hard.	Köp däl, hökman kyn hem däl.
That's it.	Ol şol.
She is with a girl.	Ol bir gyz bilen.
Of course, he already was.	Elbetde, ol öňem bardy.
He has to do it himself.	Muny özi etmeli.
Not a very good job.	Gaty gowy iş däl.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
I was not crazy about him	Men oňa däli däldim
Not surprisingly.	Muňa geň däl.
Things are happening here.	Bu ýerde zatlar bolýar.
Now it's hard.	Indi bu kyn.
I haven't seen anything like this in a while	Birnäçe wagt bäri beýle zat görmedim
I didn’t want to think about anything	Men hiç zat hakda pikir etmek islemedim
No need for words.	Söz gerek däl.
He said he wanted to go home.	Öýüne gitmek isleýändigini aýtdy.
No work.	Iş ýok.
We can go home now.	Häzir öýe gaýdyp bileris.
I knew it was going to happen	Munuň şeýle boljakdygyny bilýärdim
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
Only one will.	Diňe biri eder.
It will be difficult.	Bu kyn bolar.
I just can't do it	Men oňa diňe edip bilemok
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
What happened ?! 	Näme boldy?!
I don't know everything	Men hemme zady bilemok
Actually a bit.	Aslynda birneme.
Good.	Gowy.
I do not.	Men ýok.
I had no money	Mende pul ýokdy
I don't want to be there.	Men ol ýerde islämok.
We can't do anything about it.	Biz ony hiç zat edip bilmeris.
I'm older now	Men indi uly
Not just humans.	Diňe adam däl.
I knew there was no one else here	Bu ýerde başga hiç kimiň ýokdugyny bilýärdim
He was here, he was not.	Ol şu ýerde, ol ýokdy.
I have a lot to do	Meniň etmeli köp zadym bar
He is just like me.	Ol edil meniň ýaly.
Maybe not too bad.	Belki gaty erbet bolmaz.
I think it will be good	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gowy bolar
I immediately obeyed	Men derrew boýun boldum
There were several.	Birnäçe bardy.
I spent an hour with him	Men onuň bilen bir sagat boldum
I think you should go	Meniň pikirimçe sen gitmeli
I'm not good at anything.	Men başga hiç zat üçin gowy däl.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu dogry däl.
I think it's been a while	Meniň pikirimçe, bu iki wagt boldy
Really interesting.	Hakykatdanam gyzykly.
Really good question	Hakykatdanam gaty gowy sorag
He couldn't do anything.	Ol bir zat edip bilmedi.
Right here.	Edil şu ýerde.
I do not have and will not.	Mende ýok we bolmaz.
I think something big will happen in the near future	Meniň pikirimçe ýakyn wagtda uly bir zat bolar
It's time.	Bu sagat.
Then something started to happen.	Soň bir zat bolup başlady.
I'll do it myself	Muny özüm ederin
It didn't hurt anyone.	Bu hiç kime zyýan bermedi.
I told her calm down and we would take care of her	Men munuň menden başga hiç kim hakda däldigini aýtdym
I decided	Men karar berdim
I know this may sound strange	Munuň geň bolup biljekdigini bilýärin
And then so be it.	Soň bolsa şeýle.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ol edil şeýle.
Even then	Şol hatda.
I have the most girls against me.	Maňa garşy iň köp gyz bar.
He returned to the ground again.	Ol ýene ýere gaýdyp geldi.
If possible	Mümkin bolsa.
I can't do anything else	Başga zat edip bilemok
That may sound good.	Bu gowy ýaly bolup biler.
Just no, no, no.	Diňe ýok, ýok, ýok.
That's all.	Bu hemmeler.
I thought he was a little young	Biraz ýaş diýip pikir etdim
He decided to take her away immediately.	Derrew alyp gitmek kararyna geldi.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I did not know	Men bilmedim
It wasn’t always fun.	Elmydama gyzykly däldi.
Oh, no, this is another guy.	Aý, ýok, bu başga ýigit.
I wondered why he did that	Näme üçin beýle etdi diýip pikir etdim
Not good, but better.	Gowy däl, ýöne has gowy.
He stayed there that night.	Ol gije şol ýerde galdy.
I know how difficult it can be	Onuň nähili kyn bolup biljekdigini bilýärin
In fact, there is no reason for that.	Aslynda munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
It was as if he really knew.	Hakykatdanam bilýän ýalydy.
I could see it now	Men muny indi görüp bilýärdim
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
He could tell too.	Ol hem aýdyp bilýärdi.
I can't call you anymore	Indi saňa jaň edip bilemok
I couldn't tell anyone about it	Men bu barada hiç kime aýdyp bilmedim
He did well there.	Ol ýerde gowy etdi.
I didn't know that	Men ol hakda bilmeýärdim
They are always together.	Olar elmydama bile.
This will be difficult enough.	Bu ýeterlik kyn bolar.
I think so too	Şeýle hem şeýle bolmaly diýip pikir edýärin
There is nothing beautiful here	Bu ýerde owadan zat ýok
Everyone.	Hemmeler.
It wasn't you.	Bu sen däldi.
It will take work and time.	Iş we wagt gerek bolar.
What was the weekend like?	Dynç güni nähili boldy.
That time is not right now.	Şol wagt häzir däl.
It happens on its own.	Özi bolýar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu hakda.
I have many, many ideas now	Mende häzir köp, köp pikir bar
I always think of him	Men ol hakda hemişe pikir edýärin
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
I couldn't do anything else	Başga bir zat edip bilmedim
It was as if he couldn't do it anymore.	Indi muny edip bilmeýän ýalydy.
I told her everything.	Men oňa hemme zady aýdyp berdim.
I have no such thing.	Mende beýle zat ýok.
I have already tried everything	Men eýýäm hemme zady synap gördüm
It was good for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin gowy boldy.
I am very good	Men gaty gowy
He wanted it.	Ol muny isledi.
I gave him a lot	Men oňa köp zat berdim
Coming back tomorrow.	Ertir gaýdyp gelýär.
There is something for everyone !.	Hemmeler üçin bir zat bar!.
I've never seen this before, it's bad	Bu ýerde öň hiç wagt görmedim, bu erbet
Not tonight.	Bu gije däl.
He did the same last year.	Geçen ýyl hem edil şonuň ýaly etdi.
It will no longer be needed.	Mundan beýläk mätäç bolmaz.
They didn't have to do that.	Olar beýle etmeli däldi.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
Of course, that was not the case.	Elbetde, bu dogry däldi.
I allowed it.	Men rugsat berdim.
In fact, it is wonderful.	Aslynda bu gaty ajaýyp.
This is the former.	Bu öňküsi.
I didn’t want more trouble	Has köp kynçylyk islemedim
I was so close to him today	Men bu gün oňa gaty ýakyn boldum
I am no longer a prisoner.	Men indi tussag däl.
There is an answer.	Jogap bar.
I am an adult	Men uly adam
I thought it would be fun	Aslynda gyzykly bolar öýdüpdim
How are they.	Olar nähili.
I can tell you that.	Muny size aýdyp bilerin.
This is really smart.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty akylly.
He has nothing.	Oňa hiç zat ýok.
You are beautiful	Sen ajaýyp
I didn’t know he could sing so well	Onuň şeýle gowy aýdym aýdyp biljekdigini bilmeýärdim
There is a lot we can do here.	Bu ýerde biz köp zat edip bileris.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
It seems interesting.	Gyzykly ýaly.
I didn't have to give.	Men bermeli däldim.
I can get more. "	Has köp zat alyp bilerin "-diýdi
I'm almost there.	Men ol ýerde diýen ýaly.
I never wanted to hurt him	Men oňa hiç wagt zyýan bermek islemedim
In fact, it should be easy to do so.	Aslynda muny etmek gaty aňsat bolmaly.

They look really happy.	Olar hakykatdanam bagtly ýaly görünýär.
With the message.	Habar bilen.
This is a weekend before.	Bu öň dynç güni.

All I could think about was him	Men diňe ol hakda pikir edip bilýärdim
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
Because it is different.	Sebäbi başga.
I need someone who knows what he's doing	Maňa näme edýändigini bilýän biri gerek
Life is hard.	Durmuş gaty kyn.
He thought it was necessary.	Ol zerur diýip pikir etdi.
He stayed that way with me.	Ol meniň bilen şeýle galdy.
You can see it there.	Ony şol ýerde görüp bilersiňiz.
A little fast	Biraz çalt
I thought about it.	Men bu zat hakda pikir etdim.
What will happen	Näme bolar?
I knew this was not true	Munuň dogry däldigini bilýärdim
He must have called an hour ago.	Ol bir sagat öň jaň eden bolmaly.
This is an easy life.	Bu aňsat durmuş.
I hope it helps.	Kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
I believe it will be good	Gowy boljakdygyna ynanýaryn
I thought it was very interesting	Bu gaty gyzykly diýip pikir etdim
He had only one thing.	Onuň ýekeje ýekeje zady bardy.
I tried to call him last night	Düýn agşam oňa jaň etjek boldum
It's too fast.	Bu gaty çalt.
This is about us.	Ine, biz hakda.
How good is this	Bu nähili gowy?
We are still	Biz henizem.
I was a good girl.	Men gowy gyz boldum.
This may be the case for you.	Bu siziň üçin şeýle bolup biler.
No one wanted it.	Hiç kim ony islemedi.
It can't be like that.	Munuň ýaly bolup bilmez.
Not complete.	Doly däl.
I can't do much about it.	Bu hakda kän zat edip bilemok.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty ajaýyp.
You have to rest for a few hours	Birnäçe sagat dynç almaly
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Men edip bilemok, edip bilemok, edip bilemok.
I knew he wouldn't call	Men onuň jaň etmejekdigini bilýärdim
It's just that.	Bu diňe.
I was nothing	Men indi hiç zat däldim
There is no word on this.	Bu barada habar ýok.
Not at all.	Asla beýle zat däl.
Everything will be possible.	Bar bolup biljek hemme zat bolar.
I am the only one.	Diňe men bar.
I called, but there was no answer	Men jaň etdim, ýöne jogap ýok
Now even.	Indi hatda.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
Everyone knew it.	Hemmeler ony bilýärdi.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilmez.
I don't like it at all	Men muny asla halamok
It really happened.	Bu hakykatdanam boldy.
This is possible.	Bu mümkin.
It shouldn't have been that hard, but who knows.	Bu beýle kyn bolmaly däldi, ýöne kim bilýär.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
He did not want to do that.	Ol muny etmek islemedi.
I think it should be interesting.	Gyzykly bolmaly diýip pikir edýärin.
This was not a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk däldi.
This may be the last	Bu bolsa iň soňky bolup biler
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
Maybe it will come with age.	Belki ýaş bilen geler.
I could not agree to that	Men muňa razy bolup bilmedim
He allowed it.	Oňa rugsat berdi.
He can do that.	Ol muny edip biler.
Of course he can't.	Elbetde, edip bilmeýär.
He went to work	Işe gitdi
They are bad for work.	Olar iş üçin erbet.
Now or forever.	Indi ýa-da hemişe.
One year	Bir ýyl
I should never have done such a thing	Munuň ýaly zady hiç wagt etmeli däldim
That's all there is to it.	Ine, şu ýerde zerur zat.
What could be better?!.	Has gowy näme bolup biler?!.
I told him the truth and only the truth	Men oňa hakykaty we diňe hakykaty aýtdym
Not much this time.	Bu gezek kän däl.
Not of course, but probably.	Elbetde däl, ýöne ähtimal.
The reason is very good.	Munuň sebäbi gaty gowy.
I had no problem	Mende hiç hili mesele ýokdy
Other things can happen.	Başga zatlar bolup biler.
Someone should be at home.	Kimdir biri öýde bolmaly.
He offered me money.	Ol maňa pul teklip etdi.
He could not say.	Ol aýdyp bilmedi.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
I had to buy it for a while	Biraz wagt satyn almaly boldum
I liked it	Gowy gördüm
I don't know what happened	Näme bolandygyny bilemok
I thought it was weird	Bu gaty geň zat diýip pikir etdim
I want to be there for you	Men siziň üçin şol ýerde bolmak isleýärin
Of course, he didn't know it was there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde bardygyny bilmeýärdi.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
That would be great.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp bolardy.
Because every day life is really hard.	Sebäbi her gün durmuş hakykatdanam kyn.
I think that could be the case.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle bolup biler.
I hope it will be good	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I thought.	Men pikir etdim.
I can see it everywhere	Men ony hemme ýerde görüp bilýärin
Today is hard for me.	Bu gün meniň üçin kyn.
I did this again and again.	Men muny ýene birnäçe gezek etdim.
I never thought much	Men hiç wagt kän pikir etmedim
This is not a thing.	Bu bir zat däl.
There was no other way.	Başga ýol däldi.
Why are we like that?	Näme üçin biz şeýle?
Oh no, not me.	Aý ýok, men däl.
He always does it well	Elmydama muny gowy edýär
Why is he even here?	Näme üçin ol hatda şu ýerde?
Now.	Indi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
It's very difficult to talk to someone.	Kimdir biri bilen gürleşmek gaty kyn.
I told her.	Men oňa aýtdym.
It is necessary for this.	Munuň üçin zerur.
He is not.	Ol ýok.
I will be.	Men bolaryn.
It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
I can't do that.	Men beýle zat edip bilemok.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
This is his job.	Bu onuň işi.
He thought it was good.	Gowy diýip pikir etdi.
Everyone is late.	Hemmeler gijä galdy.
I didn't know what happened to you	Saňa näme bolandygyny bilmedim
Nothing else can be done.	Başga hiç zat edip bolmaz.
Of course I will.	Elbetde ederin.
It shouldn't be too hard.	Gaty kyn bolmaly däl.
I don't want that for anyone.	Muny hiç kim üçin islämok.
I don't know exactly what to do.	Näme etmelidigimi doly bilemok.
No one could get it.	Hiç kim alyp bilmedi.
I couldn't really tell	Men hakykatdanam aýdyp bilmedim
I never do that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmeýärin.
He has to, but he can't.	Etmeli, ýöne edip bilmez.
About him.	Ol hakda.
He says everything about her.	Ol hakda hemme zady aýdýar.
I had nothing to do.	Meniň etjek zadym ýokdy.
I was so crazy about that.	Men muňa gaty däli boldum.
This is the first thing.	Bu ilkinji zat.
Why did that happen?	Näme üçin beýle boldy?
I can't say anything else	Başga zat aýdyp biljek däl
I have a question	Mende bir sorag bar
I am everything you have	Men seniň bar zadyň
It took a while.	Biraz wagt gerek boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň sebäbi boldy.
It wasn't just me.	Bu diňe men däldi.
That alone can be good	Bu diňe gowy bolup biler
I could be a better person for you	Men siziň üçin has gowy adam bolup bilerin
I only have one question	Mende diňe bir sorag bar
I thought I would be	Men bolaryn öýdüpdim
We can't.	Biz edip bilmeris.
And then I'll have to worry about it	Soň bolsa ol hakda alada etmeli bolaryn
I thought it might be necessary	Gerek bolmagy mümkin diýip pikir etdim
I think so	Meniň pikirimçe, edil şonuň ýalydy
I am really someone else	Men hakykatdanam başga biri
We just need one.	Bize diňe biri gerek.
I took it and answered	Men alyp, jogap berdim
The only reason.	Diňe sebäbi.
Which is bigger.	Haýsy uly.
Of course he can.	Elbetde edip biler.
The money is there.	Pul şol ýerde.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
It was a long way home.	Öýe uzak ýol boldy.
In fact, it didn't bother me.	Aslynda bu meni biynjalyk etmedi.
I didn't want to know.	Men bilmek islemedim.
I think he was still there	Meniň pikirimçe, ol henizem bardy
I was very good.	Men gaty gowy boldum.
I'd like to see this.	Men muny görmek isleýärin.
It came to me.	Maňa geldi.
It will be.	Bu bolar.
It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
I have no such thing	Mende beýle zatlar ýok
I want to help her.	Men oňa kömek etmek isleýärin.
I was not so close to you	Men saňa beýle ýakyn däldim
I'm here, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Men şu ýerde "-diýdi.
I do not.	Men ýok.
It’s not really a question of whether he exists or not.	Aslynda onuň bardygyny ýa-da ýokdugyny sorag däl.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
I've been there for a month	Men bir aý boldum
I'm sure he will, of course.	Elbetde, etjekdigine ynanýaryn, ýöne.
Of course he knows.	Elbetde bilýär.
They are very easy to go.	Olar gitmek gaty aňsat.
There was someone to help me.	Maňa kömek etjek bir adam bardy.
I thought it would be sometime, but	Bir wagt bolar diýip pikir etdim, ýöne
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
I really care about you	Men hakykatdanam sen hakda alada edýärin
I hope one day	Bir gün geler diýip umyt edýärin
I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.	Bagyşlaň, ýöne bu şeýle.
In some places, however, it has completely disappeared.	Birnäçe ýerde bolsa düýbünden ýok boldy.
Maybe he will.	Belki eder.
We are very easy.	Biz gaty aňsat.
Now you are here.	Indi sen şu ýerde.
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
Can you say the same?	Edil şonuň ýaly aýdyp bilersiňizmi?
There may be two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bolup biler.
He was there.	Ol ýerde bardy.
In fact, it was not.	Aslynda beýle däldi.
It was no more.	Indi ýokdy.
I need help.	Kömek gerek.
No one is ever good or bad.	Hiç kim hiç wagt gowy ýa-da erbet däl.
There are many people.	Köp adam bar.
I had to be ready to go to school	Mekdebe gitmäge taýyn bolmaly boldum
I still can't believe it	Men henizem ynanamok
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
They are so beautiful.	Olar gaty owadan.
He's gone, he's gone.	Ol gitdi, gitdi.
That's a good idea.	Bu gaty gowy pikir.
Of course, the night would be better.	Elbetde, gije has gowy bolardy.
The last time was the worst.	Iň soňky gezek iň erbet boldy.
I think we can do better.	Has gowy edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin.
Faster.	Has çalt.
"Okay, I'll take care of it," he said.	Bolýar, alada ederin diýdi.
I have to be with him	Men onuň bilen bolmaly
From now on	Mundan beýläk
Here it is today.	Ine, şu gün ertir gitdi.
Time is always	Wagt hemişe.
I have an idea.	Mende bir pikir bar.
He can do something too.	Şeýle hem bir zatlar edip biler.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I know it will happen	Boljakdygyny bilýärin
This is better.	Bu has gowy.
We are nothing.	Biz hiç zat däl.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
The next lie, the next lie.	Indiki ýalan, indiki ýalan.
It's been many years.	Köp ýyl boldy.
I was with him for three years	Men onuň bilen üç ýyl boldum
I just can't seem to get close to it	Diňe oňa ýakyn bolmak hakda pikir edip bilemok
Maybe someone can help me.	Belki kimdir biri maňa kömek edip biler.
This is not necessarily a bad thing.	Bu hökman erbet zat däl.
You may need it.	Size gerek bolup biler.
I think it will be good	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gowy bolar
I didn't want to see you like that	Seni beýle görmek islemedim
I doubt it will be the same as before	Munuň öňküsi ýaly boljakdygyna şübhelenýärin
There will never be a problem with it.	Onuň bilen hiç wagt mesele bolmaz.
I thought it was great	Gaty gowy diýip pikir etdim
I'll call you.	Men saňa jaň ederin.
It was not difficult to do that.	Muny etmek kyn däldi.
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat.
He is still there.	Ol henizem şol ýerde.
This is not a big deal.	Bu kän bir zat däl.
There is enough money there.	Ol ýerde ýeterlik pul bar.
It is impossible to do so.	Muny etmek mümkin däl.
I think that's a good thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy zat.
We are not together	Biz bile däl.
This could be the reason.	Munuň sebäbi bolup biler.
He needs someone like you.	Oňa seniň ýaly biri gerek.
He wants it very badly.	Ol muny gaty erbet isleýär.
I was happy.	Men bagtly boldum.
I said he could	Edip biljekdigini aýtdym
It wasn’t just about debt.	Bu diňe karz hakda däldi.
I couldn't see much.	Men gaty görüp bilmedim.
I have enough	Mende ýeterlik zat bar
This could be a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk bolup biler.
He didn't think much.	Ol kän pikir etmedi.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I didn't know much about it	Men bu hakda kän zat bilmeýärdim
She is there to get a girl.	Ol gyz almak üçin şol ýerde.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
Things get interesting here.	Bu ýerde zatlar gyzykly bolýar.
I can't help myself.	Özüne kömek edip bilemok.
Maybe this is a bad answer.	Belki, bu erbet jogap.
I didn't see him do that	Men onuň muny edenini görmedim
They are nothing.	Olar bir zat däl.
It turned out beautiful.	Owadan çykdy.
I know how to do it	Seni nädip etmelidigini bilýärin
I haven't slept much in the last few nights	Soňky birnäçe gije gaty uklap bilmedim
I thought something could happen	Bir zat bolup biler öýdüpdim
Bad, very good.	Erbet, gaty gowy.
I didn't have to tell you that	Men saňa muny aýtmaly däldim
One last thing.	Soňky bir zat.
I didn't want to do anything with the girl	Gyz bilen hiç zat etmek islemedim
I hope it will be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
He knew very well now.	Ol indi gaty gowy bilýärdi.
I believe in him completely	Men oňa doly ynanýaryn
I hope something like this is not needed.	Munuň ýaly bir zat zerur bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
I had nothing to give.	Maňa bermeli zady ýokdy.
That night, that was often not the case.	Şol gije, köplenç beýle däldi.
I'm always scared	Men hemişe gorkýaryn
I gave you everything.	Men saňa hemme zady berdim.
About bad times.	Erbet wagt hakda.
Why did he do that?	Näme üçin beýle etdi?
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
I visited it once last year.	Geçen ýyl bir gezek baryp gördüm.
I don't trust you	Men saňa ynanamok
No need to worry.	Alada etmegiň sebäbi ýok.
I didn't want to talk about it.	Men bu hakda gürleşmek islemedim.
I thought better of you.	Men senden has gowy pikir etdim.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
I had so much fun with that	Munuň bilen gaty hezil etdim
I trust you completely	Men size doly ynanýaryn
It's as if he wants something.	Bir zat isleýän ýaly.
I can't say what he thinks	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini aýdyp bilemok
Close to him	Oňa ýakyn.
I haven't seen anyone else.	Başga hiç kimi görmedim.
I hope you don't mind	Muňa garşy bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin
I have not been able to test myself in this way	Özümi beýle synap görüp bilmedim
She is just beautiful.	Ol diňe owadan.
That didn't help either.	Bu hem kömek etmedi.
I thought about it	Men bu hakda pikir etdim
The future has come.	Geljek indi.
I had a lot of fun this year.	Bu ýyl gaty hezil etdim.
He thought I was scared.	Men gorkýaryn diýip pikir etdi.
I'm not like you	Men seniň ýaly däl
I couldn't have that	Mende beýle zat bolup bilmedi
I think this is very interesting	Bu gaty gyzykly diýip pikir edýärin
I believe in him.	Men oňa ynanýaryn.
Two days, two nights.	Iki gün, iki gije.
There was only one last thing.	Diňe bir soňky zat bardy.
He shouldn't be here.	Ol bu ýerde bolmaly däl.
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
The problem is not that.	Mesele ol däl.
I just want to go there	Men diňe ol ýere gitmek isleýärin
This was not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däldi.
There seemed to be no question about it.	Bu hakda hiç hili sorag ýok ýalydy.
No money.	Pul ýok.
Someone has to get it.	Kimdir biri almaly.
He told me he was doing it.	Ol maňa muny edýändigini aýtdy.
I didn’t think it was necessary before	Öň zerur diýip pikir etmedim
About everything.	Hemme zat hakda.
The sun did not help because it did not exist.	Gün hiç hili kömek etmedi, sebäbi ýokdy.
It will not be enough for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin ýeterlik bolmaz.
I can't do anyone else like that	Munuň ýaly başga birini edip bilemok
I knew he couldn't say no	Men onuň "ýok" diýip bilmeýändigini bilýärdim
You are not	Sen beýle däl
I will be a completely different person	Men düýbünden başga adam bolaryn
Must agree.	Razy bolmaly.
In the past, everything was nothing.	Öň hemme zat hiç zat däldi.
This is not an issue or an issue.	Bu mesele ýa-da hiç zat däl.
He does it.	Ol muny edýär.
I haven't tried it yet, but in the near future	Men entek synap görmedim, ýöne ýakyn wagtda
I had never been so close before	Men ozal beýle ýakyn däldim
It would be a lie to say something else.	Başga bir zat aýtmak ýalan bolar.
I didn't do that for me	Muny meniň üçin etmedim
I didn't think about it	Men bu barada hiç zat pikir etmedim
It's too big.	Ol gaty uly.
I didn't want anything.	Men hiç zady islemedim.
This may take some time.	Bu birneme wagt alyp biler.
I saw it twice.	Iki gezek gördüm.
I don’t want to help him anymore	Oňa mundan beýläk kömek etmek islämok
Other things.	Başga zatlar.
This is not my year.	Bu meniň ýyl däl.
I think it's good.	Gowy öýdýän.
I didn't see it that way.	Men ony beýle görmedim.
It's really easy.	Bu hakykatdanam aňsat.
I called him again	Men oňa ýene jaň etdim
This made me anxious.	Bu zat meni biynjalyk etdi.
That will be the case.	Şeýle bolar.
This is not something to worry about.	Bu alada etmeli zat däl.
The last few times I let you know	Soňky birnäçe gezek size habar berdim
I am a girl	Men gyz
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty owadan.
I have to do something good for her	Men onuň üçin gowy zat etmeli
For several years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri.
In fact, this is a bit of a lie.	Aslynda bu biraz ýalan.
Everything is new.	Hemme zat täze.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
I called you several times	Men saňa birnäçe gezek jaň etdim
I want to be good to her	Men oňa gowy bolmak isleýärin
It was not for me.	Bu meniň üçin däldi.
Only you have to be	Diňe seniň bolmaly
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
He had more.	Oňa has köp zat bardy.
I want to talk to him	Men onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
This makes him a little worried.	Bu, ony birneme biynjalyk edýär.
No one was right.	Hiç kim dogry aýtmady.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
I let him.	Men oňa rugsat berdim.
He told you something about a man.	Bir adam hakda size bir zat aýtdy.
Isn't that an easy question?	beýle aňsat sorag dälmi?
Now they are everywhere.	Indi olar hemme ýerde.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
It should be interesting.	Gyzykly bolmaly.
I did not want to go to this school	Bu mekdebe gitmek islemedim
I have done many things	Men köp zatlar etdim
I have to be with you	Men seniň bilen bolmaly
Too bad for him.	Onuň üçin gaty erbet.
So you have to do it.	Şonuň üçin hökman etmeli.
I did it myself	Bu işi özüm etdim
Of course, I was not crazy	Elbetde, däli däldim
I think this is the right thing to do.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry bir zat etmeli.
I can say that he is very happy	Men onuň gaty begenýändigini aýdyp bilerin
I can't take it anywhere else.	Men muny başga ýere alyp bilemok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle gowy bolup bileris.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
This was not a new idea.	Bu täze pikir däldi.
This is not for him.	Bu onuň üçin däl.
I'm not for that.	Men bu iş üçin däl.
I think that helped me a bit.	Bu maňa birneme kömek etdi diýip pikir edýärin.
Opportunity for a new life	Täze durmuş üçin mümkinçilik
Oh, no, that's not it.	Aý, ýok, beýle däl.
Nothing good.	Gowy zat ýok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Edil şonuň ýaly etmeli ýaly.
I can't call him	Men oňa jaň edip bilemok
I can see a lot for myself	Özüm üçin köp zady görüp bilýärin
I have to take it quickly	Men ony çalt alyp gitmeli
I couldn't think of another way	Başga ýol hakda pikir edip bilmedim
This can take a long time.	Bu köp wagt alyp biler.
Not at that time.	Şol wagt däl.
To be beautiful is not to be beautiful.	Owadan bolmak owadan bolmak däl.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
The police were very helpful.	Polisiýa gaty kömek etdi.
Of course, there is.	Elbetde, bar ýaly.
I've been there a long time	Men köp wagt boldum
In fact, I didn't think much of it	Aslynda bu hakda kän pikir etmedim
It was not beautiful.	Bu owadan däldi.
Nothing new about the idea.	Pikir hakda hiç zat täze däl.
Anyway.	Her hili.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
He thought it would be at home.	Öýde şeýle bolar diýip pikir etdi.
I am not.	Men beýle däl.
I want to go too far	Men gaty köp gitmek isleýärin
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
Too much indeed.	Hakykatdanam gaty köp.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
That shouldn't be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däl.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
I bought it	Men ony satyn aldym
I can't help you	Men size kömek edip bilemok
That's all he needs.	Bu oňa gerek zat.
The man also started working.	Ol adam hem işe başlady.
This is his time.	Bu onuň wagty.
I don’t know what that could be.	Munuň näme bolup biljekdigini bilemok.
Of course it happened.	Elbetde boldy.
There is a lot here.	Bu ýerde köp zat bar.

We must destroy it.	Biz ony ýok etmeli.
He has to go with you.	Ol seniň bilen gitmeli.
It will be us.	Bu biz bolar.

In fact, just like me.	Aslynda edil meniň ýaly.

You also have to vote.	Şeýle hem ses bermeli.
No words.	Hiç hili söz ýok.
And then it got serious again.	Soň bolsa ýene çynlakaý boldy.
I hope you are well.	Gowy bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin.
Tell me what happened.	Näme bolandygyny maňa aýdyň.
Anything at home.	Islän zady öýde.

A lot of work.	Köp iş.
I did it.	Men muny etdim.
I had no idea there was such a thing	Munuň ýaly zadyň bardygyny bilmeýärdim
It would be easy.	Bu aňsat bolardy.
I doubt that.	Men muňa şübhelenýärin.
He took one.	Birini aldy.
I have to be.	Men bolmaly.
I didn't really care	Men hakykatdanam alada etmedim
I don’t have to say anything bad about it.	Men ol hakda erbet zat aýtmaly däl.
Many times	Köp gezek.
Several, even.	Birnäçe, hatda.
I think he is serious	Meniň pikirimçe, ol çynlakaý
Not many people know that.	Muny köp adam bilmeýär.
I didn't want to do that	Men munuň ýaly zady etmek islemedim
I can't do that because I didn't have to	Men muny edip bilemok, sebäbi ýokdy
'.	'.
He did not.	Beýle etmedi.
This is, of course, a mistake.	Bu, elbetde, ýalňyşlyk.
It's not like you	Bu seniň ýaly däl
He is now asleep.	Ol indi uklap galdy.
He didn't even care.	Ol hatda alada etmedi.
I was here a few years ago	Birnäçe ýyl mundan ozal bu ýerde boldum
He is still with us.	Ol henizem biziň bilen.
It should never have been a big song.	Hiç haçan uly aýdym bolmaly däldi.
It will be a long night.	Bu uzak gije bolar.
I called him yesterday	Düýn oňa jaň etdim
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
I was a little busy there	Men ol ýerde birneme meşgul boldum
This is for you.	Bu seniň üçin.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
They are so new and beautiful.	Olar gaty täze we owadan.
This is not serious.	Bu çynlakaý däl.
That's it.	Bu zat.
You know	Bilýärsiň.
Of course it can.	Elbetde bolup biler.
It is also very good.	Şeýle hem gaty gowy.
I really do.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle edýärin.
It can't be that easy.	Bu gaty aňsat bolup bilmez.
I can't say he has to do anything else	Başga bir zat etmelidigini aýdyp bilemok
It sounds bad, but it doesn't.	Bu erbet ýaly görünýär, ýöne beýle däl.
I think that's enough	Bu ýeterlik diýip pikir edýärin
Of course.	Elbetde.
I have something to do right now	Şu wagt etmeli bir zadym bar
'year'	'ýyl'
I want a lot to be with you	Seniň bilen bolmak üçin köp zat isleýärin
That seemed like a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir ýalydy.
He didn't have to.	Ol hökman däldi.
It's a wonderful evening.	Bu ajaýyp agşam.
I knew it would be hard	Kyn boljakdygyny bilýärdim
It can be the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly bolup biler.
I did nothing for you	Men saňa hiç zat etmedim
They are new every morning.	Olar her gün irden täze.
I didn't need to.	Maňa gerek däldi.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Edil şonuň ýaly etmegiň wagty geldi.
Right here.	Edil şu ýerde.
Oh, how he wanted to go.	Aý, nädip gitmek isledi.
I can't say right now	Şu wagt aýdyp biljek däl
There were other things.	Başga zatlar bardy.
He likes me.	Ol meni halaýar.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
He says he doesn't know.	Bilmeýändigini aýdýar.
I haven't seen a really interesting one	Hakykatdanam gyzykly birini görmedim
I'm ready for it	Men muňa taýyn
Nothing.	Hiç hili zat ýok.
I didn’t think it was possible	Mümkin diýip pikir etmedim
I saw him there.	Men ony şol ýerde gördüm.
I want to be a better person.	Men has gowy adam bolmak isleýärin.
He is not like us.	Ol biziň ýaly däl.
Not necessary, but probably not a bad idea.	Gerek däl, ýöne erbet pikir däl bolsa gerek.
We can do a lot.	Biz köp zady edip bileris.
You are a wonderful person	Sen ajaýyp adam
I always knew that	Men muny elmydama bilýärdim
I knew it was going to happen	Munuň boljakdygyny bilýärdim
He was very surprised.	Ol gaty geň galdy.
Good job	Gowy iş.
She is worried.	Ony biynjalyk edýär.
I couldn't do anything myself	Özümi hiç zat edip bilmedim
This is a problem.	Bu kynçylyk.
I just want money	Men diňe pul isleýärin
He could no longer help himself.	Indi özüne kömek edip bilmedi.
I know him very well	Men ony gaty gowy bilýärin
Now or never.	Häzir ýa-da hiç haçan ýok.
I don't have to give you another way	Men saňa başga ýol bermeli däl
He really wanted to do that for us.	Ol hakykatdanam biziň üçin muny dogry etmek isledi.
She is wonderful.	Ol ajaýyp.
I can't be everywhere and I can't do everything right away	Men hemme ýerde bolup bilemok we hemme zady derrew edip bilemok
Everyone is one.	Hemmeler kimdir biri.
In fact, I have	Aslynda mende bar
It's easy for me.	Bu meniň üçin aňsat.
This may still be the case.	Bu henizem bolup biler.
I said that.	Men muny aýtdym.
That's a lot for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty köp.
I can do anything for everyone	Hemmeler üçin hemme zady edip bilerin
In fact, it was.	Aslynda ol şeýle boldy.
I can't do anything wrong	Men erbet zat edip bilemok
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
It would be easy.	Bu aňsat bolardy.
And then we're there.	Soň bolsa biz şol ýerde.
We can only get so much.	Biz diňe köp zady alyp bileris.
I didn't see anything	Men hiç zady görmedim
Everything will be fine.	Hemme zat bolar.
I didn't think about it.	Men bu hakda hiç zat pikir etmedim.
He does just that.	Diňe şeýle edýär.
I couldn't say that.	Men muny aýdyp bilmedim.
It's been a difficult year.	Kyn ýyl boldy.
You have to call him.	Oňa jaň etmeli.
I want to talk to you	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
Just like now	Edil häzirki ýaly.
Something could really happen.	Hakykatdanam bir zat bolup biler.
I think that could be a big concern	Bu uly alada bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin
Good.	Gowy.
He knew everything and everything.	Ol hemme zady we hemme zady bilýärdi.
I'm already here.	Men öňem şu ýerde.
Everything is very difficult.	Hemme zat gaty kyn.
I want to be young again	Men ýene ýaş bolmak isleýärin
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Very nice.	Gaty ajaýyp.
At the time, I thought it was a good idea	Şol wagt gowy pikir diýip pikir etdim
I heard.	Men eşitdim.
I don't know anything about that	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilemok
Everything is up tonight	Şu gije hemme zat bar
I think he likes you	Meniň pikirimçe, ol sen hakda halaýar
He could not go anywhere.	Ol hiç ýere gidip bilmedi.
I can get it myself	Muny özüm alyp bilerin
I have no one at all	Mende asla adam ýok
How are you there?	Ol ýerde nähili.
I want to know right away.	Derrew bilmek isleýärin.
You only have to call once.	Diňe bir gezek jaň etmeli.
I could not allow it	Men muňa rugsat berip bilmedim
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I have been doing this for many years	Men muny köp ýyl bäri edýärin
This was not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däldi.
That's right.	Dogry.
Time is not just with us.	Wagt diňe biziň bilen däl.
This is not the case this year.	Bu ýyl beýle däl.
Only answer.	Diňe jogap.
I really think so.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle pikir edýärin.
I can take care of me	Men hakda alada edip bilerin
There are actually two things.	Aslynda iki zat.
They must have seen me.	Olar meni gören bolmaly.
I can't think of anything else to do	Başga etjek zadym hakda pikir edip bilemok
He knows that.	Ol muny bilýär.
I think it's good	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin
It's hard.	Kyn zat.
You are that man	Sen şol adam
She is not beautiful.	Ol owadan däl.
Too hard for you.	Siziň üçin gaty kyn bolmak.
I want that	Men muny isleýärin
It really helped me.	Bu hakykatdanam maňa kömek etdi.
That was not the case for us.	Bu biziň üçin beýle däldi.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
No one cared.	Hiç kim hiç zat hakda alada etmedi.
I had to go home	Men öýe gitmeli boldum
He does just that.	Edil şonuň ýaly edýär.
The news was good.	Habar gowy boldy.
I want to be with you completely	Men siziň bilen doly bile bolmak isleýärin
I am here.	Men şu ýerde.
They are not the only ones.	Olar diňe bir däl.
Nothing bad.	Erbet zat ýok.
Very, very, very!	Gaty, gaty, gaty!
I had to let you know	Size habar bermeli boldum
I didn't have to do that alone	Muny ýeke özüm etmeli däldim
Only one remained.	Diňe biri galdy.
I don't know anything about that.	Bu hakda hiç zat bilemok.
Do it for you	Muny seniň üçin et.
He is not even young.	Ol hatda ýaş hem däl.
The problem is different.	Mesele başga.
Of course, everyone is.	Elbetde, hemmeler şeýle.
I thought about the girl	Gyz hakda pikir etdim
I can't try	Synap bilemok
I want to be like him	Men onuň ýaly bolmak isleýärin
Next time, next time.	Indiki gezek, indiki gezek.
Of course, he didn't say that.	Elbetde, ol muny aýtmady.
Of course I didn't	Elbetde etmedim
I could sleep well	Gowy uklap bilýärdim
For you.	Siziň üçin.
I thought it would be really fast.	Bu hakykatdanam çalt iş bolar öýdüpdim.
I'm sorry about that	Men oňa gynanýaryn
They are many.	Olar köp.
It will not happen again.	Mundan beýläk bolmaz.
He didn't think so.	Ol muny pikir etmedi.
He never called the police.	Ol hiç haçan polisiýa jaň etmedi.
Of course they exist or should be.	Elbetde olar bar ýa-da bolmaly.
It will always be that way.	Hemişe şeýle bolar.
I only have one person	Mende diňe adam bar
Of course, I didn't want that	Elbetde, men muny islemedim
I want to be that person	Men ol adam bolmak isleýärin
Somewhere	Bir ýerde.
Of course, I knew right away	Elbetde, derrew bilýärdim
You are his.	Sen onuň.
He was still there.	Ol ýerde henizem bardy.
You need to call quickly.	Çalt jaň etmeli.
And then nothing happened.	Soň bolsa hiç zat ýok boldy.
He knows this is not the case.	Ol beýle däldigini bilýär.
This should not be so difficult.	Bu beýle kyn bolmaly däl.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe bir zat etmeli.
Not only good.	Diňe gowy däl.
I think the police should call	Polisiýa jaň etmeli diýip pikir edýärin
This is not really the case.	Bu hakykatdanam bir ýa-da hiç zat däl.
It's a very difficult task.	Ol gaty kyn iş.
I had enough.	Mende ýeterlik boldy.
He can talk.	Ol gürläp biler.
I can never see anything	Men asla hiç zady görüp bilemok
There is a good reason for this.	Munuň üçin gowy sebäp bar.
I can't tell you about it	Men bu hakda size aýdyp biljek däl
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda indi beýle bolýar.
He apologized.	Bu ötünç sorady.
Not there now.	Häzir ol ýerde ýok.
They should be.	Olar bolmaly.
I called.	Men jaň etdim.
He thought it was never enough.	Hiç wagt ýeterlik däl diýip pikir etdi.
There were so many ways for one.	Ol ýerde biri üçin gaty köp ýol bardy.
I tried another.	Başga synap gördüm.
At that time.	Şol wagt.
I can't speak for a girl	Men gyz üçin gürläp bilemok
When and when.	Haçan we haçan.
Too many, so crazy.	Gaty köp, gaty däli ýalydy.
Not many answers.	Jogap köp däl.
This is smart.	Bu akylly.
I didn't have to tell him	Men oňa aýtmaly däldim
Ask you a question.	Size sorag.
He did not want any help.	Ol hiç hili kömek islemedi.
I didn't see him tonight	Men ony şu gije görmedim
A lot, but not with us	Köp zat, ýöne biziň bilen däl
I thought he wanted to talk too	Ol hem gürleşmek isleýär öýdüpdim
I couldn't go to school today	Bu gün mekdebe gidip bilmedim
I am very good	Men gaty gowy
Good song.	Gowy aýdym.
I can't think of those things	Men ol zatlar hakda pikir edip bilemok
It will be a good time.	Gowy wagt bolar.
I got it and it didn't bother me	Men muny aldym we meni biynjalyk etmedi
You would be easy.	Siz aňsat bolardy.
I didn't mean to offend him	Men oňa hiç zat aýtmak islemedim
I just want to talk to you	Men diňe siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
He likes you.	Ol sizi halaýar.
I did it once myself	Bir gezek muny özüm etdim
This is a really good thing.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy zat.
It was even harder.	Bu hatda kyn boldy.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Indi ol hakda gürleşmek islämok.
To get it.	Ony almak üçin.
Fast food for a quick life.	Çalt durmuş üçin çalt nahar.
I will not be here myself	Özüm bu ýerde bolmaz
I have only one option	Mende diňe bir mümkinçilik bar
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
The next challenge came.	Indiki kynçylyk geldi.
I can't do anything	Men hiç zat edip bilemok
In fact, he did	Aslynda şeýle diýdi
This is different for me.	Meniň üçin bu başga.
I don't know enough.	Men ýeterlik bilemok.
I could still see it	Men henizem ony görüp bilýärdim
I was not serious.	Men çynlakaý däldim.
There was something wrong.	Dogry däl bir zat bardy.
This will not happen either.	Bu hem bolmaz.
Maybe not at all	Belki asla bolmaz
It was with him.	Onuň bilen boldy.
I'm full of you	Men doly sen
I will do better this time	Bu gezek has gowy ederin
I saw it yesterday.	Men ony düýn gördüm.
Good.	Gowy.
Not as before.	Öňküsi ýaly däl.
He was not alone.	Diňe özi däldi.
I don't have to give myself up	Men özümi bermeli däl
It can be a good and full life	Gowy we doly durmuş bolup biler
They are here.	Olar şu ýerde.
This is not true	Bu dogry däl
I just thought it was very interesting.	Diňe gaty gyzykly diýip pikir etdim.
To get you	Seni almak.
That's what he last saw	Men onuň iň soňky gören zady
Of course, it was a long way off.	Elbetde, uzak ýol boldy.
It's easy to say.	Ony aýtmak aňsat.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, ýeterlik däl.
There was plenty of working time.	Iş wagty köp boldy.
I can't take it anymore	Indi alyp bilemok
Don't go for less that your full potential	Uzak gitmeli däl
I allowed him to do whatever he wanted with me	Men onuň bilen islän zadyny etmegine rugsat berdim
I can't say.	Men aýdyp biljek däl.
Something like this will always happen.	Munuň ýaly zat hemişe bolar.
Not this year.	Bu ýyl däl.
I thought everything was fine	Hemme zat gowy diýip pikir etdim
She really wants it.	Ol hakykatdanam erbet isleýär.
This way, better.	Bu ýol, has gowy.
I'm fine with that.	Men muňa gowy.
There will be little to do.	Onuň etmeli işi kän bolmaz.
I was with him	Men onuň bilen bile boldum
Not just for himself.	Diňe özi üçin däl.
Really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy.
I hope it helps.	Size kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
He was ready for it.	Ol muňa taýyn boldy.
It's too crazy here.	Bu ýerde gaty däli.
He could see it, but he couldn't go.	Ol muny görüp bilýärdi, ýöne baryp bilmedi.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
It's nothing, but it's nothing.	Bu hiç zat däl, ýöne bir zat däl.
That's the way it is today.	Bu gün şeýle boldy.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
Not surprisingly.	Geň däl.
I am not one	Men bir däl
I didn't know what he wanted	Men onuň isleýän zadyny bilmeýärdim
That could be a bad idea.	Bu erbet pikir bolup biler.
He did not respond.	Ol hiç hili jogap bermedi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şonuň ýaly.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe gowy iş.
I am that person.	Men ol adam.
Sorry, he said again.	Bagyşlaň, ol ýene aýtdy.
I can get it	Men ony alyp bilerin
I can see it there	Men ony şol ýerde görüp bilýärin
It's very easy and fun.	Bu gaty aňsat we gyzykly.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
In short.	Gysga.
It came very quickly.	Gaty çalt geldi.
Just something else.	Diňe başga bir zat.
It may take months.	Munuň üçin birnäçe aý gerek bolsa gerek.
The idea is nothing	Pikir hiç zat däl
I have never seen her so beautiful	Men ony beýle owadan görmedim
I heard something else.	Men ýene bir zat eşitdim.
Now I know, once, if not.	Indi bilýärin, bir gezek, ýok bolsa.
I have a lot to do	Meniň etmeli köp zadym bar
He did not say anything about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat aýtmady.
Where is he	Ol nirede.
I didn't bother him	Men ony biynjalyk etmedim
It's too short.	Bu gaty gysga.
I didn't know what he was thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilmedim
I never do anything early.	Men hiç wagt ir zat etmeýärin.
I know he told you that, but it wasn't true	Bilýärin, saňa muny aýtdy, ýöne bu dogry däldi
I think there must be something wrong	Bir hili ýalňyşlyk bolmaly diýip pikir edýärin
I gave everything and tried everything else	Men hemme zady berdim we başga zatlary synap gördüm
It really does exist.	Hakykatdanam bar.
Now a completely new one is coming.	Indi düýbünden täze biri gelýär.
I thought this was a great idea	Bu ajaýyp pikir diýip pikir etdim
I hoped it wasn’t too big	Gaty uly däl diýip umyt etdim
What about him? 	Ol hakda näme?
no	ýok.
It can be big.	Uly bolup biler.
It’s hard to say that’s a good thing.	Muny gowy zat diýip aýtmak kyn.
I also think this is a very good idea	Şeýle hem bu gaty gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin
I could never do that.	Men muny hiç haçan edip bilmedim.
I called three times	Üç gezek jaň etdim
I can't do anything here.	Men bu ýerde hiç zat edip bilemok.
I couldn’t be mad with him	Men onuň bilen däli bolup bilmedim
I had enough	Mende ýeterlik zat bardy
It was the worst night ever.	Bu, iň erbet gije boldy.
I just thought about going home	Men diňe öýe gitmek hakda çynlakaý pikir etdim
I always think of them	Men olar hakda hemişe pikir edýärin
I knew what he was thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilýärdim
I don't believe it.	Men oňa ynanamok.
Someone knows.	Kimdir biri biler.
There is time, there is still hope.	Wagt bar, henizem umyt bar.
I can't get it home fast enough	Ony öýe ýeterlik çalt alyp bilemok
For me, it was a human reason.	Meniň üçin bu adam sebäbi boldy.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
We need this man.	Bu adam bize gerek.
I knew what he was thinking	Men onuň näme hakda pikir edýändigini bilýärdim
He stayed there.	Ol şol ýerde galdy.
I have not tried this	Men muny synap görmedim
That was not the case for me.	Meniň üçin bu beýle däldi.
I think that makes him happy	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ony bagtly edýär
I can't hurt anyone with that.	Munuň bilen hiç kime zyýan berip bilemok.
I don't know why.	Näme üçin beýle bolandygyny bilemok.
I did not object	Men muňa garşy däldim
You can be yourself or someone else.	Özüňiz ýa-da başga biri bilen bolup bilersiňiz.
I haven't seen anything about it at all	Men bu barada düýbünden hiç zat görmedim
It takes a year to do.	Etmek üçin bir ýyl gerek.
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat zat däl.
Then the girl came.	Soň gyz geldi.
He never does anything else.	Ol hiç wagt başga zat etmeýär.
I can't say that.	Men muny aýdyp biljek däl.
I could do nothing	Men hiç zat edip bilmedim
I don't want anything	Men hiç zat islämok
Maybe it was nothing.	Belki hiç zat däldi.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
One is here, one is there.	Biri şu ýerde, biri ol ýerde.
I don’t know what happened there, but one thing.	Ol ýerde näme bolandygyny bilemok, ýöne bir zat.
Last night	Düýn gije.
This is not smart.	Bu akylly däl.
Two years ago.	Iki ýyl ozal.

This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
Where is he	Ol nirede?

I hope it will be easier.	Has aňsat bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
I do two things very well	Iki zady gaty gowy edýärin

He was right.	Ol gaty dogry aýtdy.
Not much.	Kän däl.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Diňe bar bolmak üçin hiç zat ýok.
I thought it was great	Bu gaty gowy diýip pikir etdim
I can do something for you.	Men siziň üçin bir zat edip bilerin.
I agree with that	Men muňa razy
Tomorrow again.	Ertir ýene.
Bad man	Erbet adam.
So you don't have to go anywhere else.	Şonuň üçin başga ýere gitmek hökman däl.

This is a good decision for me.	Bu, meniň üçin gowy karar.
I thought it was good	Gowy diýip pikir etdim
This will not happen.	Bu bolmaz.
It was a great day.	Bu ajaýyp gün boldy.
This is with us too.	Bu hem biziň bilen.
I like everything.	Hemme zat halaýar.
He thought so.	Ol şeýle diýip pikir etdi.

Just by being there.	Diňe şol ýerde bolmak bilen.
And then there is and.	Soň bolsa bar we.
I just didn’t want to talk	Diňe gürleşmek islemedim

It was not very big.	Bu gaty uly däldi.
This and that	Bu we başga
It's very beautiful here.	Bu ýerde gaty owadan.

Something else.	Başga bir zat.

In the morning.	Irden.
He did more.	Has köp zat etdi.
I didn't think anyone would know that	Muny hiç kim biler öýdemokdym
It could be a few hours early in the evening	Agşam birnäçe sagat ir gowy bolup biler
I still don’t fully believe that	Men henizem muňa doly ynanamok
A man	Bir adam.
It didn't work.	Bu etmedi.
Many people did.	Köp adam şeýle etdi.
I told her.	Men oňa aýtdym.
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
I had to go with him	Men onuň bilen gitmeli boldum
I couldn't take it anymore	Indi alyp bilmedim
It's time.	Wagty geldi.
For them, that's what they want to do.	Olar üçin bu etmek isleýän zady.
The timing was not right.	Wagty dogry däldi.
It will be.	Ol bolar.
It's not that bad.	Bu beýle erbet däl.
Just self-indulgence, maybe.	Diňe özüni meşgul etmek, belki.
I didn't even know how to do it	Nädip etmelidigimi hem bilmeýärdim
I can give you something	Men saňa bir zat berip bilerin
I could always tell him the truth	Men oňa hemişe hakykaty aýdyp bilýärdim
Before or after.	Öň ýa-da indi.
I have to say more.	Maňa has köp zat aýtmaly.
They were there now.	Olar indi bardy.
This is not for us.	Bu biziň üçin däl.
I can go back to talk to him tomorrow	Ertir onuň bilen gürleşmek üçin gaýdyp bilerin
You can do this well.	Muny gowy edip bilersiňiz.
We need help.	Bize kömek gerek.
This is not just for me.	Bu diňe meniň üçin däl.
I didn't think so.	Men pikir etmedim.
Closer to home.	Öýe has ýakyn.
There is time.	Wagt bar.
I never have	Mende hiç wagt ýok
I could do that	Men muny edip bilýärdim
I saw it all.	Men hemmesini gördüm.
Will come back with another question.	Başga bir sorag bilen gaýdyp geler.
This is a question.	Bu sorag.
I never knew it could be so fast	Munuň beýle çalt bolup biljekdigini hiç wagt bilmeýärdim
This is a big deal.	Bu uly mesele.
And then to report.	Soň bolsa habar bermek üçin.
There really is no other way.	Hakykatdanam başga ýol ýok.
I was young again.	Men ýene ýaş boldum.
No one knows everything.	Hiç kim hemme zady bilmeýär.
He says it made him a better person.	Munuň özüni has gowy adam edendigini aýdýar.
I did this to help you	Men muny size kömek etmek üçin etdim
I think we will never know	Hiç haçan bilmeris öýdýän
I take care of myself.	Men özüm alada edýärin.
I want to say that.	Muny aýtmak isleýärin.
He just says he doesn't like you.	Diňe senden razy däldigini aýdýar.
I got everything right	Men hemme zady gowy aldym
Many people do, but not so.	Köp adam edýär, ýöne beýle däl.
I thought it better	Men muny has gowy pikir etdim
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
I can't go to it	Men oňa baryp bilemok
He did a great job.	Ajaýyp iş etdi.
I want that	Men muny isleýärin
You are another person.	Sen başga adam.
And talk.	We gürleşmek.
I think this looks good on you	Meniň pikirimçe, bu size gowy görünýär
It's fun, but it's bad.	Bu gyzykly, ýöne erbet.
You are a smart guy	Sen akylly ýigit
I have never said that before	Men muny öňem aýdyp bilmedim
I don't know what happened to him.	Oňa näme bolandygyny bilemok.
It looks great now.	Häzir gaty gowy görünýär.
I still don't know how.	Men entek nädip bilemok.
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
It's weird to talk about that.	Bu hakda gürleşmek geň zat.
I know a lot about you	Men senden köp zady bilýärin
I don’t really know much about that.	Men bu hakda hakykatdanam köp zat bilemok.
This is what the book does	Bu kitap şeýle edýär
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He thought it was possible.	Ol mümkin diýip pikir etdi.
Everything is fine with me.	Hemme zat meniň bilen gowy.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
It seemed impossible.	Bu mümkin däl ýalydy.
Sounds like fun.	Gaty hezil ýaly.
I couldn't hurt him anymore	Men oňa mundan beýläk zyýan berip bilmedim
As before.	Öňküsi ýaly.
You can still do it.	Siz henizem edip bilersiňiz.
Good to see you again	Seni ýene görmek gowy zat.
It is impossible to do so.	Muny etmek mümkin däl.
I can't see	Görüp bilemok
You should know better.	Siz has gowy bilýän bolmaly.
I can never hurt you	Men saňa hiç wagt zyýan berip bilemok
He didn't care.	Oňa alada etmedi.
It can also be very difficult.	Şeýle hem gaty kyn bolup biler.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
I thought it would never happen	Munuň asla bolmaz diýip pikir etdim
You have to do this fast	Muny çalt etmeli
I didn’t want to think it was the right idea.	Dogry pikir diýip pikir etmek islemedim.
He came and went.	Geldi we gitdi.
I haven't seen you in a while.	Birnäçe wagt bäri seni görmedim.
Always there.	Elmydama şol ýerde.
This is not the case.	Bu däl.
I can't answer right now	Men häzir jogap berip bilemok
I saw everything	Men hemme zady gördüm
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
They are not happy.	Olar bagtly däl.
There were a number of issues.	Birnäçe mesele bardy.
I'm not good enough for you	Men senden ýeterlik däl
That's the way life is.	Durmuş şeýle.
What a night	Näme gije.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ol indi alyp bilmedi.
I need you	Sen maňa gerek
There was nothing else there.	Ol ýerde başga zat ýokdy.
I'm fine with that.	Men muňa gowy.
I couldn't think of anything else to do there	Men ol ýerde başga hiç zat etmek hakda pikir edip bilmedim
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy boldy.
Nothing else.	Başga zat ýok.
He hoped it would.	Ol şeýle bolar diýip umyt etdi.
Okay, not good, not before.	Bolýar, gowy däl, öňem däl.
I think he came here today	Meniň pikirimçe, şu gün ol şu ýere geldi
I think maybe.	Mümkin diýip pikir edýärin.
Of course, I will do this again	Elbetde, muny ýene bir gezek ederin
This time it was very bad.	Bu gezek gaty erbet boldy.
I knew it was there	Men munuň bardygyny bilýärdim
I didn't think about it	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim
If possible	Mümkin bolsa.
I could only see it	Men ony diňe görüp bilýärdim
That day	Şol gün.
You can visit.	Siz baryp görüp bilersiňiz.
I was there with them	Men olar bilen şol ýerde boldum
It doesn't even have to be here.	Bu ýerde hatda bolmaly däl.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
A little new, the police later realized.	Biraz täze, polisiýa soň düşündi.
I could tell what he was thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini aýdyp bilýärdim
I am always	Men hemişe men.
I think they are beautiful	Meniň pikirimçe, olar owadan
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
All life is here.	Bütin durmuş şu ýerde.
I gave it to him	Men onuň üçin berdim
I don't have to worry about it	Men onuň hakda alada etmeli däl
It did us a disservice.	Bu bize birneme zyýan berdi.
I can't even sing	Men hatda aýdym aýdyp bilemok
I hoped there would be more.	Has köp bolardy diýip umyt etdim.
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat.
Maybe I thought.	Belki pikir etdim.
Of course, he knew a lot.	Elbetde, köp zady bilýärdi.
I have a lot of money	Mende köp pul bar
That night there was no right.	Bu gije ol ýerde dogry däldi.
I had never thought of that before.	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim.
How strange.	Nähili geň.
There is something intelligent and wonderful for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin akylly we ajaýyp bir zat bar.
I could go for it	Men munuň üçin gidip bilýärdim
I can do good things	Men gowy zatlar edip bilerin
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
It has been here for a long time.	Bu ýerde köp wagt bäri bardy.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly	Mümkin, samsyk ýalydy
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I want to talk to you	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
I hope this is not too bad for you	Bu siziň üçin gaty erbet däl diýip umyt edýärin
I don’t want to think about it anymore	Indi bu hakda pikir etmek islämok
No one did anything.	Hiç kim hiç zat etmedi.
I didn't need it right now	Maňa edil şu wagt gerek däldi
I didn't think it would be beautiful	Bu owadan bolar öýdemokdym
I think it looks better	Meniň pikirimçe, bu has gowy görünýär
I'm glad to see you	Men sizi görüp begenýärin
It's just that.	Bu diňe.
I didn’t love or care about myself	Özümi gowy görmedim ýa-da alada etmedim
I didn't have fun.	Men hezil etmedim.
I did nothing wrong	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedim
Today	Şu gün.
Good.	Gowy.
I actually thought about doing it.	Aslynda muny etmek hakda pikir etdim.
Seems like a good idea.	Gowy pikir ýaly bolup görünýär.
Now everything is different	Indi hemme zat başga
I hoped it would be enough today	Bu gün ýeterlik bolar diýip umyt etdim
Man wants.	Adam isleýär.
I hope to be there tomorrow	Ertir şol ýerde bolaryn diýip umyt edýärin
They are things.	Olar zatlar.
One will suffice.	Biri ýeterlik bolar.
Maybe it's you.	Belki, bu sen.
I think it even makes us	Bu bizi hatda edýär öýdýän
Anytime	Islän wagty.
You don't need to	Size gerek däl
I was very worried	Men gaty alada etdim
No one agrees to do that.	Hiç kim muny etmäge razy däl.
You have to do it now.	Muny indi etmeli.
Not many people know that.	Muny köp adam bilmeýär.
I've tried this before	Muny eýýäm bir gezek synap gördüm
Awesome awesome.	Ajaýyp ajaýyp.
Of course, now I'm worried	Elbetde, indi alada etdim
He can give it to you.	Ol size berip biler.
So this is not really the answer.	Şonuň üçin bu hakykatdanam jogap däl.
You can do something about it.	Bu hakda bir zat edip bilersiňiz.
Everyone wanted to talk to him.	Her kim onuň bilen gürleşmek isledi.
I never thought about it	Men bu barada hiç wagt pikir etmedim
I'm not crazy anymore	Men indi däli däldim
I have to.	Mende bolmaly.
It takes a book or it can be two or three.	Munuň üçin kitap gerek ýa-da iki ýa-da üç bolup biler.
It could be me.	Bu men bolup bilerin.
This is not a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý zat däl.
This is a good and bad thing.	Bu gowy we erbet zat.
As before.	Ine, öňküsi ýaly.
He doesn't do that.	Ol muny etmeýär.
I can't help it	Men oňa kömek edip bilemok
I know this very well	Men muny gaty gowy bilýärin
I did not object.	Men muňa garşy däldim.
They and you.	Olar we siz.
I think it was never a good time	Hiç bir wagt gowy wagt ýaly däldi öýdýän
I'm sure it will help	Kömek etjekdigine ynanýaryn
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
No one else was like him.	Başga hiç kim onuň ýaly däldi.
Not much, but it definitely helped.	Kän däl, ýöne hökman kömek etdi.
I think it's ready for the road	Bu ýol üçin taýyn diýip pikir edýärin
No message can be a message.	Hiç bir habar habar bolup bilmez.
Something to give.	Bermeli bir zat.
There were several reasons for his decision	Kararyna birnäçe sebäp berdi
You have to decide.	Siz muňa karar bermeli.
This is a wonderful day.	Bu ajaýyp gün.
It did.	Bu etdi.
It won't be good.	Gowy bolmaz.
Why or why not.	Näme üçin ýa-da näme üçin ýok.
It gave me a very good idea.	Bu maňa gaty gowy pikir berdi.
Right here, right now.	Edil şu ýerde, edil şu wagt.
Only so.	Diňe şeýle.
I know it can be difficult	Kyn bolup biljekdigini bilýärin
The food is great.	Nahar gaty gowy.
A little more, maybe.	Biraz köp, belki.
A lot of work, but good	Köp iş, ýöne gowy
Which one is it.	Ol haýsy.
I agree with him	Men onuň bilen razy boldum
There should be no problem.	Mesele bolmaly däl.
You need to	Size gerek bolmaly.
I couldn't call	Jaň edip bilmedim
I can say that a lot	Men muny köp zat aýdyp bilerin
You have to rest.	Dynç almaly.
I know what he wants	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärin
There is no way to know this.	Muny bilmek üçin ýol ýok.
He just told the truth.	Ol diňe hakykaty aýtdy.
He never harmed her.	Ol hiç wagt oňa zyýan bermedi.
I do this very badly	Men muny gaty erbet edýärin
I was not serious.	Men çynlakaý däldim.
Now I have an idea.	Indi bir pikir bar.
Is that so?	Bu şeýlemi?
In fact, never.	Aslynda hiç haçan.
I'm doing it right now	Men şu wagt edýärin
I don't care.	Men bu barada alada etmeýärin.
It will be difficult.	Bu kyn bolar.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Häzir has gowy durmuş.
This is not new.	Bu düýbünden täze däl.
I will be very short	Men gaty gysga bolaryn
You have to worry.	Alada etmeli.
I didn't think much	Kän pikir etmedim
Not necessarily for good.	Gowy üçin hökman däl.
Nothing can be clearer.	Hiç zat has aýdyň bolup bilmez.
That would be nice.	Bu gowy bolar.
I thought a lot about you	Men sen hakda köp pikir etdim
In fact, it is a must have.	Aslynda, hökman etmeli.
I think that's why we are.	Meniň pikirimçe, munuň sebäbi biz.
I could not see anyone	Men hiç kimi görüp bilmedim
This idea gave us hope.	Bu pikir bize umyt berdi.
I have, about me.	Mende, men hakda.
Nothing else can and cannot happen.	Başga bir zat bolup bilmez we bolup bilmez.
I can't go now	Men häzir gidip bilemok
I don't think he can do anything but help us.	Bize kömek etmekden başga zat edip bilmez diýip pikir edýärin.
This can never happen.	Bu hiç wagt bolup bilmez.
This was not an easy task.	Bu aňsat zat däldi.
Maybe too much.	Belki, gaty köp.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
I knew nothing else.	Men başga hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
He must have done the right thing	Dogry bir zat eden bolmaly
"Everyone got it," he said.	"Hemmeler aldy" -diýdi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şeýle adam.
They were everywhere.	Olar hemme ýerde bardy.
We can't answer.	Biz jogap berip bilmeris.
I can't think of anything right now	Men häzir hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilemok
My last suggestion.	Men soňky teklip.
I couldn't tell him the truth	Men oňa hakykaty aýdyp bilmedim
Which is correct.	Haýsy dogry.
Work is work, and money is money	Iş bir iş, pul bolsa pul
I really need two.	Maňa hakykatdanam iki gerek.
They have fun.	Olar hezil edýär.
I am very happy at home	Men öýde gaty bagtly
I did a few things with him	Men onuň bilen birnäçe zatlar etdim
He said he did not know.	Bilmeýändigini aýtdy.
It looks serious.	Çynlakaý görünýär.
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
He can get it.	Ol alyp biler.
No one else paid attention to him.	Başga hiç kim oňa üns bermedi.
He's gone, he's gone.	Ol gitdi, ol gitdi.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Last thought.	Soňky pikir.
You know, there's one.	Näme bilýärsiň, biri bar.
There is a reason for this.	Munuň bir sebäbi bar.
I'm ready for it	Men munuň üçin taýyn boldum
I do not have.	Mende ýok.
Why did he come? 	Näme üçin geldi?
I knew more than that	Men mundan has köp zady bilýärdim
I have a word.	Mende bir söz bar.
I just want to help.	Men diňe kömek etmek isleýärin.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
I didn't want to be with him.	Men onuň bilen bile bolmak islemedim.
Worst time.	Iň erbet wagt.
Good.	Gowy.
In fact, they were not alone.	Aslynda olar ýeke däldi.

It's not too early.	Bu entek ir däl.
I thought about everything	Men hemme zady pikir etdim
Which one.	Haýsy.
I had no one else	Mende başga adam ýokdy
I didn't do it at all.	Men düýbünden etmedim.

I can lend you	Men size karz berip bilerin
I don't know who did it.	Kimiň edenini bilemok.
I saw it.	Men ony gördüm.
Life seemed good.	Durmuş gowy ýalydy.
I wanted to suggest the same thing	Men edil şol zady teklip etjek boldum
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
I didn't know that at all	Men muny düýbünden bilmeýärdim
Now no one wants to go there.	Indi hiç kim ol ýere gitmek islemeýär.
I haven't seen it before.	Men ozal görmedim.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Mümkin bolup biler, sebäbi bu dogry bolup biler.
It's interesting because it can't do that.	Bu gyzykly, sebäbi muny edip bilmeýär.
He made no mistake.	Ol hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedi.
He had a chance.	Oňa mümkinçilik bardy.
You are me	Sen men.
I don't know what he's doing there	Men onuň ol ýerde näme edýändigini bilemok
They are nowhere.	Olar hiç ýerde däl.
I think it still exists	Meniň pikirimçe, ol henizem bar
This is the biggest thing.	Bu iň uly zat.
It was a good life for us here	Bu ýerde biziň üçin gowy durmuş boldy

Lots of opportunities.	Köp mümkinçilik.
I have a lot of money	Mende köp pul bar
It was as if he could take it all.	Hemmesini alyp bilýän ýalydy.
Today was a great day.	Bu gün gaty gowy gün boldy.

It was good.	Gowy boldy.
I am no more	Men eýýäm ýok
It's really cool.	Aslynda ajaýyp.
He can't speak.	Ol gürläp bilmeýär.
It would be interesting.	Gyzykly bolardy.
You are not really good.	Siz hakykatdanam gaty gowy däl.

This can be difficult.	Bu kyn bolup biler.
I wasn't going to do that	Men muny etjek däldim
I could never tell him.	Men oňa hiç haçan aýdyp bilmedim.
He needs me.	Ol maňa mätäç.
You are completely different.	Siz düýbünden başga ýerde.
I had nothing	Mende hiç zat ýokdy
I'll do it tonight	Men şu gije şeýle ederin
This can only happen.	Bu diňe bolup biler.
I'm still here.	Men henizem şu ýerde.

I didn't think so	Beýle bolar öýdemokdym
It would be nice	Gowy bolardy
Of course, this is both good and bad.	Elbetde, bu hem gowy, hem erbet zat.

Now there is another problem.	Häzir başga bir mesele bar.
I thought about it a lot	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim
I think they look weird	Meniň pikirimçe, olar geň görünýär
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
He came himself.	Ol özi geldi.
I thought it was a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir etdim.
A lot of people just want a good answer	Köp adam diňe gowy jogap almak isleýär
I think a lot of people will.	Meniň pikirimçe, köp adam eder.
I couldn't think of anything worse	Başga bir erbet zat hakda pikir edip bilmedim
There was more noise.	Has köp ses çykdy.
I'm there again.	Men ýene şol ýerde.
He will not be young.	Ol ýaş bolmaz.
He voted.	Ol ses berdi.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
Not good news.	Gowy habar däl.
I don’t know what happened there, but he’s not with them anymore.	Ol ýerde näme bolandygyny bilemok, ýöne ol indi olar bilen däl.
It's his job to know that.	Muny bilmek onuň işi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Hakykatdanam, bu dogry.
I want it very badly.	Men ony gaty erbet isleýärin.
I know he was happy	Men onuň bagtly bolandygyny bilýärin
This is bad.	Bu erbet.
Excuse me, can you let me in?	Bagyşlaň, maňa rugsat berip bilersiňizmi?
The same is true with credit.	Karz bilen hem edil şonuň ýaly.
Everyone knew about him.	Ol hakda hemmeler bilýärdi.
Not two.	Iki däl.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
This is a good and bad thing.	Bu gowy we erbet zat.
He lives there.	Ol şol ýerde ýaşaýar.
You don't have to worry about it.	Oňa alada etmeli däl.
He could not answer.	Jogap hem berip bilmedi.
I couldn't help it.	Men oňa kömek edip bilmedim.
I can't do anything else	Başga hiç zat edip bilemok
He must have done it a few years ago	Birnäçe ýyl mundan ozal eden bolmaly
I said it would be easy	Aňsat boljakdygyny aýtdym
I think that's too much.	Bu gaty köp diýip pikir edýärin.
Not much, not so fast.	Kän däl, beýle çalt däl.
This was not the case, and he did not need it here.	Bu beýle däldi, bu ýerde oňa zerur zat ýokdy.
I don’t know what he would think of that	Men onuň bu barada näme pikir etjekdigini bilemok
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I just want a better life for her	Men diňe onuň üçin has gowy durmuş isleýärin
It won't be that bad.	Bu beýle erbet bolmaz.
A lot of people want to see that.	Köp adam muny görmek isleýär.
I had nothing.	Mende hiç zat ýokdy.
Several people asked about it.	Birnäçe adam bu hakda sorady.
Let me tell you - it was a scary place	Saňa aýdyp bilerin, dogry hiç wagt aňsat däl
I didn't want to go anywhere	Men hiç ýere gitmek islemedim
I want to be there.	Men şol ýerde bolmak isleýärin.
I know how to do it	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilýärin
Then you have to call	Soň saňa jaň etmeli
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
I asked a question	Men bir sorag berdim
Something wanted me.	Bir zat meni isledi.
The call is coming	Jaň gelýär
The problem.	Mesele.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
The question was who knew.	Sorag kim bilýärdi.
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
Like the police.	Polisiýa ýaly.
I have to agree.	Men razy bolmaly.
Good.	Gowy.
I thought he would come back with her	Onuň bilen gaýdyp geler öýdüpdim
Giving us a lot of time is good for us.	Bize gaty köp wagt berip, bize gowy.
He did not want to.	Ol islemedi.
I didn't know what he was thinking	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilmeýärdim
I didn't think much of it	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmedim
There was still hope.	Entek umyt bardy.
That should be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolmaly.
He didn't tell me anything.	Maňa hiç zat aýtmady.
Here's one.	Ine, şu ýerde biri.
I don't know what he thinks	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilemok
I think it would be good	Gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin
I can't always be here	Men bu ýerde hemişe bolup bilemok
Bad bad	Erbet erbet
I have been with him several times.	Men onuň bilen birnäçe gezek boldum.
We have to be here.	Biz şu ýerde bolmaly.
I'm not good anymore	Men indi gowy däl
It's been such a long year.	Şeýle uzak ýyl boldy.
I never wanted to hurt you	Hiç haçan saňa zyýan bermek islemedim
I couldn't see it anymore	Indi muny görüp bilmedim
There is a very good reason for this.	Munuň üçin gaty gowy sebäp bar.
It's very difficult now.	Häzirki wagtda gaty kyn.
Question and Answer.	Sorag we jogap.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
I want to go there.	Men ol ýere gitmek isleýärin.
I just thought it would always be there	Men diňe hemişe şol ýerde bolar öýdüpdim
He really did go.	Ol hakykatdanam gitdi.
We can't say that out loud.	Muny gaty ses bilen gürläp bilmeris.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki, muny etmek gyzykly bolmagy üçin eden bolsa gerek.
This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
I didn't mean to offend him	Men oňa muny aýtmak islemedim
There seems to be something really going on.	Hakykatdanam bir zady bar ýaly.
He had never thought of that before.	Ol ozal beýle pikir etmedi.
That's all for me.	Meniň üçin hemme zat.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
That was the last word.	Şeýle soňky söz boldy.
It's not me.	Bu men däl.
You will have to be there.	Şol ýerde bolmaly bolarsyňyz.
Why? 	Näme üçin?
Nothing good.	Hiç zat gowy däl.
This is good and true.	Munuň özi gowy we dogry.
I want to go tomorrow	Ertir gitmek isleýärin
Something at home.	Öýde bir zat.
Many people come every year.	Her ýyl köp adam gelýär.
I had to pay attention.	Üns bermeli boldum.
It will be really big.	Hakykatdanam uly bolar.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
I can recommend a few and there are	Birnäçe maslahat berip bilerin we bar
I was in the right place.	Men edil dogry ýerde boldum.
I want to see you there!	Men sizi ol ýerde görmek isleýärin!
I don’t think anyone else is here.	Bu ýerde başga hiç kim ýok öýdemok.
He thought it was too soon.	Ol gaty gysga wagtda diýip pikir etdi.
He also knew.	Ol hem bilýärdi.
That would have to be.	Bu etmeli bolardy.
You are not enough	Siz ýeterlik däl
I want to talk all night	Men bütin gije gürleşmek isleýärin
He thinks he doesn't like me	Ol meni halamaýar öýdýän
Enough is enough.	Elbetde ýeterlik.
He thought better.	Ol has gowy pikir etdi.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
You have nothing now.	Indi seniň hiç zadyň ýok.
I hope everything is fine	Hemme zat gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin
I told him he was	Men oňa bardygyny aýtdym
I didn’t want to be a cop	Men polisiýa bolmak islemedim
We have to.	Biz etmeli.
And then it was there.	Soň bolsa şol ýerde boldy.
He knows what he's doing.	Ol näme edýändigini bilýär.
I didn't think so	Bolýar diýip pikir etmedim
I already said that	Men muny eýýäm aýtdym
This is young	Bu ýaş
I always think about them	Men elmydama olar hakda pikir edýärin
I have hope.	Maňa umyt gelýär.
It may seem strange to say that.	Muny aýtmak geň zat ýaly bolup biler.
He had to stop thinking like that.	Ol beýle pikir etmegi bes etmeli boldy.
This should be the easiest.	Bu iň aňsat bolmaly.
Good and bad.	Gowy we erbet zat.
Of course this is possible.	Elbetde bu mümkin.
They are too early.	Olar gaty ir.
I knew it	Men muny bilýärdim
He didn't think so.	Ol beýle pikir etmedi.
It was lunch.	Nahar boldy.
I'm not one	Men däl biri
That should not be the case.	Bu dogry bolmaly däl.
There was another way.	Başga bir ýol bardy.
I have to do it now	Men indi etmeli
I tried.	Synap gördüm.
One is nothing.	Biri hiç zat däl.
He didn't think so.	Ol muny pikir etmedi.
I saw him do that.	Men onuň muny edýändigini gördüm.
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
Not three times.	Üç gezek däl.
I didn't want to think about it	Bu hakda pikir etmek islemedim
No problem here.	Bu ýerde mesele ýok.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Aslynda beýle zat bolmaz
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýok.
I told her it was OK	Men oňa gowy boljakdygyny aýtdym
All the time	Bütin wagt.
I have never seen a problem.	Hiç haçan mesele görmedim.
She is still well.	Ol henizem gowy galdy.
I've seen it everywhere	Men ony hemme ýerde gördüm
I thought there was something serious about it	Men onuň üçin çynlakaý bir zat bar öýdüpdim
Because it is different.	Sebäbi başga.
A little	Biraz.
Of course I will	Elbetde, ýene bir gezek ederin
I didn't think much of it	Men ol hakda kän pikir etmedim
Now it's interesting.	Indi gyzykly.
We can do better.	Biz has gowy edip bileris.
Last but not least	Iň soňky
Just for fun.	Diňe hezil etmek üçin.
Seems like a problem.	Kynçylyk ýaly görünýär.
He does it well and looks happy.	Ol muny gowy edýär we bagtly ýaly görünýär.
We don't think so.	Biz beýle däl ýaly.
He would have to do that.	Muny etmeli bolardy.
I don't want to talk to anyone about it.	Bu hakda hiç kim bilen gürleşmek islämok.
I don't think so now.	Men häzir pikir etmeýärin.
It's not just you.	Bu diňe siz däl.
I have a lot of doubts about that.	Men muňa gaty şübhelenýärin.
There has to be a better way.	Has gowy ýol bolmaly.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
There is no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýok.
That's it.	Bu zat.
.	.
Okay.	Bolýar.
They are everywhere.	Olar hemme ýerde.
It looks good right now.	Şu wagt gowy görünýär.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Munuň özi karar bermeli däl.
I have to tell him.	Oňa aýtmaly.
You can see this last year.	Muny geçen ýyl görüp bilersiňiz.
He was very worried.	Ol köp alada etdi.
Necessary things.	Zerur zatlar.
She is beautiful.	Ol owadan.
I know things everywhere.	Men hemme ýerde zatlary bilýärin.
we can't go	gidip bilmeris
They are many.	Olar köp.
I'm so sorry for him.	Men oňa gaty gynanýaryn.
He hasn't told me much yet.	Ol entek maňa kän zat aýtmady.
You only need one place.	Size diňe bir ýerde gerek.
There was no such time before.	Ozal beýle wagt ýokdy.
I'm thinking of calling you.	Men size jaň etmek hakda pikir edýärin.
I told you everything.	Men saňa hemme zady aýtdym.
They are really hard.	Olar hakykatdanam kyn.
I didn't think about it.	Men bu barada pikir etmedim.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle.
It was good to go.	Gitmek gowy boldy.
I'm sorry for her.	Men onuň üçin gynanýaryn.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu beýle däl ýaly.
He is alone and alone.	Ol özüne we ýeke özi.
Someone and everyone is ready to do it.	Kimdir biri we her kim etmäge taýyn.
I trust you	Men saňa ynanýaryn.
It was not for them.	Bu olar üçin däldi.
There was nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.
He bought it.	Ol ony satyn aldy.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
We need it this year.	Bize şu ýyl gerek.
Not much, enough.	Kän däl, ýeterlik.
Needless to say.	Hiç zat aýtmak hökman däl.
I didn't think much.	Kän pikir etmedim.
He didn't have to do that.	Ol muny etmeli däldi.
What happened to him?	Oňa näme boldy.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
This has always been the case for me.	Bu meniň üçin hemişe şeýle boldy.
There was someone else that night.	Şol gije başga biri bardy.
In fact, there is no such thing.	Aslynda beýle zat ýok.
Not for you.	Siziň üçin däl.
I will	Etjek
It was great to see that.	Muny görmek gaty gowy boldy.
He is for me.	Ol meniň üçin.
How is this possible?	Bu nädip mümkin?
I should never have said that.	Men muny hiç haçan aýtmaly däldim.
There was no girl.	Gyz ýokdy.
I know these things	Men bu zatlar hakda bilýärin
Of course.	Elbetde.
I thought it looked great.	Ajaýyp görünýär öýdüpdim.
A complete thing.	Doly bir zat.
I know this is not enough	Munuň ýeterlik däldigini bilýärin
To see it.	Ony görmek üçin.
It wasn't that hard.	Bu beýle kyn däldi.
He may or may not do so	Ol muny edip biler ýa-da edip bilmez
You don't have to be here	Siz bu ýerde bolmaly däl
I didn't think about it	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim
I will always be with you	Men elmydama siziň bilen bolaryn
Interesting idea.	Gyzykly pikir.
We really need it.	Bize hakykatdanam zerur.
I need more time.	Maňa has köp wagt gerek.
He returned two weeks later.	Iki hepde soň gaýdyp geldi.
He wants to talk.	Ol gürleşmek isleýär.
Only once.	Diňe bir gezek.
I have to do something	Men bir zat etmeli
He can get it.	Ol muny alyp biler.
He took her away.	Ony alyp gitdi.
This is indeed the case.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle.
He said good.	Gowy diýdi.
I didn’t want to bother him anymore.	Ony mundan beýläk biynjalyk etmek islemedim.
I can't say anymore	Indi aýdyp biljek däl
I had no other choice, he told himself	Mende başga ýol ýokdy, ol özüne aýtdy
They will be many.	Olar köp bolar.
It should be in the morning.	Irden bolmaly.
I think that's a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin.
In your opinion he is.	Siziň pikiriňizçe ol.
I am human.	Men adam.
Wants to do	Etmek isleýär.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bolýar soňky sorag.
I didn't even see it.	Men hatda ony görmedim.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu dogry ýol.
He did not pay attention.	Ol üns bermedi.
I must	Men hökman
I am for him.	Men onuň üçin.
He had to do something to keep himself busy.	Özüni meşgul etmek üçin bir zat etmeli boldy.
Just a question.	Diňe bir sorag.
He can't even sleep.	Ol hatda uklap hem bilmez.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
They are not so good.	Olar beýle gowy däl.
I can	Men edip bilerin
There is almost no hope.	Umyt ýok diýen ýaly.
He got it.	Ol muny aldy.
Another way.	Başga ýol.
I fully believe that.	Men muňa doly ynanýaryn.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
He wants it now, too.	Ol hem indi isleýär.
It's good to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy zat.
He has no time for me.	Onuň meniň üçin hiç wagt wagty ýok.
He was not ready yet.	Ol entek taýyn däldi.
If only with hope.	Diňe umyt bilen bolsa.
You have to go.	Gitmeli.
I can't do anything	Men hiç zat edip bilemok
This is different.	Bu başga.
That should not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däldi.
Someone else.	Başga biri.
He is.	Ol şeýle.
Maybe here.	Belki şu ýerde.
You need to rest a little.	Biraz dynç almaly.
Okay.	Bolýar.
So that's great.	Şonuň üçin bu uly.
I can do better than you.	Men senden has gowy edip bilerin.
It will be easy enough.	Bu ýeterlik aňsat bolar.
It would be a good meal tomorrow.	Ertir gowy nahar bolardy.
Of course.	Elbetde.
This is a serious mistake.	Bu çynlakaý ýalňyşlyk.
It will continue to be so.	Mundan beýläk şeýle bolar.
I'm ready for it.	Men muňa taýyn.
There were several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bardy.
He was still there.	Ol henizem bardy.
One thing for sure.	Elbetde, bir zat.
Because it was right.	Sebäbi bu dogry boldy.
It looked really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy ýalydy.
Anxiety, of course.	Elbetde, biynjalyk.
Concerned neo-hippies and their global warming, i'll tell ya.	Bu barada alada.
If someone needs it, they just call.	Kimdir biri oňa mätäç bolsa, ol diňe jaň edýär.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Ol özüni hiç haçan doly bilmeýändigini bilýärdi.
Of course, this is not good.	Elbetde, bu gowy däl.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
What happened, happened.	Näme boldy, boldy.
This is an idea.	Bu bir pikir.
She is worried.	Ol biynjalyk bolýar.
Seriously beautiful.	Çynlakaý owadan.
Dinner together tonight.	Şu gün agşam, bile nahar.
I can't do that for you	Men muny seniň üçin edip bilemok
Of course not.	Elbetde, ol ýok.
Because the time has come.	Sebäbi wagt geldi.
I was never like that.	Men hiç wagt beýle däldim.
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
Same thing.	Edil şol bir zat.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
Now it worries me.	Indi meni biynjalyk edýär.
Couldn't be	Bolup bilmedi
They are not stupid.	Olar samsyk däl.
It was new.	Bu täze boldy.
Good job	Gowy iş.
I may be what you need.	Size gerek zat bolup bilerin.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
He objected to me again.	Ol ýene maňa garşy çykdy.
I don’t think he’s an interesting person anymore.	Meniň pikirimçe, indi gyzykly adam däl.
He can.	Edip biler.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
He must have been a very good man.	Ol gaty gowy adam bolsa gerek.
I want to do something.	Men bir zat etmek isleýärin.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde ýalňyşlyk ýok.
You have to borrow for that.	Munuň üçin karz almaly.
A year ago.	Bir ýyl ozal.
This is a completely different idea.	Bu düýbünden başga pikir.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
It's just crazy.	Bu diňe däli.
How to know and know this.	Muny nädip bilmek we bilmek.
Of course.	Elbetde.
No one said that.	Muny hiç kim aýtmady.
I thought he just liked beautiful things.	Ol diňe owadan zatlary halaýar diýip pikir etdim.
There is no help at home.	Öýde kömek ýok.
None.	Hiç biri.
Now he is here.	Indi ol şu ýerde.
Quick.	Çalt.
I know that now.	Men muny indi bilýärin.
And then a little weird.	Soň bolsa birneme geň bolýar.
I didn't see it that way.	Men ony beýle görmedim.
I think everyone does that.	Her kim muny edýär diýip pikir edýärin.
I don't know what happened to him.	Oňa näme bolandygyny bilemok.
I have an idea.	Mende bir hili pikir bar.
He is still	Ol henizem.
Now he seems to want to talk more.	Indi has köp gürleşmek isleýän ýaly.
This is not very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn däl.
This is often not the case.	Köplenç beýle däl.
Everything is beautiful.	Owadan hemme zat mesele.
He was there for them, but it was not for me.	Ol olar üçin bardy, ýöne meniň üçin beýle däldi.
This is something else.	Bu başga zat.
Probably not.	Mümkin, hiç wagt däl.
He said a lot.	Ol gaty köp zat aýtdy.
I'm never good enough.	Men hiç wagt ýeterlik däl.
I am happy for him.	Men onuň üçin bagtly.
He knew it would never happen.	Munuň hiç haçan bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärdi.
He needs it, he must be.	Oňa mätäç, hökman bolmaly.
He could not say anything else.	Ol başga zat aýdyp bilmedi.
He was another man.	Ol başga bir adam boldy.
These are wonderful things.	Bu ajaýyp zatlar.
Nothing can be said about that.	Bu hakda hiç zat aýdyp bolmaz.
Not for the first time, either.	Ilkinji gezek däl, şeýle hem.
I am very fast.	Men gaty çalt.
This is not an idea.	Bu pikir däl.
These three must be big.	Bu üç uly bolsa gerek.
If everyone else had done that.	Başga hemmeler muny eden bolsa.
What a man he is.	Ol nähili adam.
How good is that	Bu nähili gowy.
So it was very difficult.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty kyn boldy.
This is not a problem.	Munuň özi mesele däl.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
There is always something you want.	Elmydama başga bir zat isleýän zat bar.
The next one is the next one.	Indiki we indiki.
Of course it was.	Elbetde şeýle boldy.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
It's two hours late.	Iki sagat gijä galdy.
Everyone wants to do that.	Her kim muny etmek isleýär.
I need someone	Maňa kimdir biri gerek
He was amazed.	Muňa haýran galdy.
Of course, I thought many times.	Elbetde, köp gezek pikir etdim.
He made the decision himself.	Ol özi karar berdi.
Only with me.	Diňe meniň bilen.
There was no one in the house.	Öýde hiç kim ýokdy.
It seems right to me.	Maňa dogry ýaly görünýär.
He had to do something.	Ol bir zatlar etmeli boldy.
Everyone knows what happened.	Näme bolandygyny hemmeler bilýär.
It's very interesting.	Ol gaty gyzykly.
To make a good call.	Gowy jaň etmek üçin.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
It could be worse.	Has erbet bolup biler.
You have a problem.	Mesele bar sen.
You know, like, a good book or something.	Gowy kitap ýa-da bir zat ýaly bilýärsiň.
I can speak now.	Men häzir gürläp bilerin.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
I didn’t know any better.	Men mundan has gowy bilmedim.
I think it's good for him.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol onuň üçin gowy.
He asked.	Ol sorady.
We are never ready.	Biz hiç wagt taýyn däl.
We are.	Biz şeýle.
So it would be a good time.	Şonuň üçin gowy wagt bolardy.
This is a big question.	Bu uly sorag.
He never wanted to.	Ol hiç haçan islemedi.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
It's too early in the morning.	Irden gaty ir.
And then he started talking.	Soň bolsa gürläp başlady.
I just had to do it.	Men diňe etmeli boldum.
He couldn't think.	Ol pikir edip bilmedi.
In fact, I need it.	Aslynda, maňa gerek.
Only two.	Diňe ikisi.
And now he's back.	Indi bolsa gaýdyp geldi.
I often wonder.	Men köplenç haýran.
Okay, here it is.	Bolýar, ine şu ýerde.
What is the closest.	Iň ýakyn näme.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
In a good place.	Gowy ýerde.
Almost no one yet.	Entek hiç kim ýok diýen ýaly.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Dogry däldigini aýdyň.
It's like a book.	Bu edil kitap ýaly.
I knew it was going to happen.	Munuň şeýle boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
I'll do something else.	Men başga bir zat ederin.
You are stupid	Sen samsyk.
Not everyone is there.	Hemmeler ol ýerde däl.
I can't do anything at all	Men düýbünden hiç zat edip bilemok
You can also be a very happy person by buying.	Siz hem satyn alyp, gaty bagtly adam bolup bilersiňiz.
It was not good.	Gowy däldi.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He did not do so for questioning.	Muny sorag etmek üçin etmedi.
He wanted it badly.	Ol muny erbet isledi.
He did not want to see her.	Ol ony görmek islemedi.
This is not harmful.	Bu zyýan däl.
He could no longer do anything about it.	Ol indi bu barada hiç zat edip bilmedi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
In the evening.	Agşam.
This will make me anxious.	Bu meni biynjalyk eder.
I have three.	Mende üç.
Life is weird.	Durmuş geň.
It’s been like a week for me.	Bu maňa bir hepde ýaly boldy.
He did well.	Gowy etdi.
I did it for you, for us.	Men muny seniň üçin, biziň üçin etdim.
This may be very true.	Bu gaty dogry bolup biler.
I can't see	Men görüp bilemok
It seemed very fast, of course.	Elbetde, gaty çalt ýalydy.

Maybe the last time.	Belki iň soňky gezek.
He asked you.	Ol senden sorady.
He doesn't have to.	Ol hökman däl.
What he did.	Öz eden işi.
It was the same.	Şeýle hem ýalydy.
I did it.	Men muny etdim.
No one was as young as they used to be.	Hiç kim öňküsi ýaly ýaş däldi.
I don't even know.	Hatda bilemok.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
It's fun to do that.	Muny etmek gyzykly.
This was not what he wanted.	Bu onuň isleýän zady däldi.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
Really, I'm doing better now.	Hakykatdanam, häzir has gowy edýärin.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman dogry däl.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmek hökman däl.
She is very strange.	Ol gaty geň.
This is a concern.	Bu alada.
That's right- this is not about me.	Meniň üçin bu dogry.
This is not easy nowadays.	Häzirki wagtda bu aňsat däl.
It really stuck with me.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň bilen galdy.
Tomorrow is another day.	Ertir başga bir gün.
Not just to do something.	Diňe bir zat etmek üçin däl.
I never thought of him that way.	Men ol hakda hiç wagt beýle pikir etmeýärin.
I did this several times, and no one helped.	Muny birnäçe gezek etdim, hiç kim kömek etmedi.
I don't need anything from you.	Maňa senden hiç zat gerek däl.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
He allowed it.	Ol ýol berdi.
I'm too young to do that.	Men muny etmek üçin gaty ýaş.
More, more please.	Has köp, has köp haýyş edýärin.
This is a big mistake.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
I really don't believe it.	Men hakykatdanam ynanamok.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
Only him and me.	Diňe özi we men.
I'll do it myself.	Muny özüm etjek.
He can't get it.	Ol muny alyp bilenok.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
He was very concerned about this.	Ol muňa uly alada etdi.
In fact, he did not want to say it out loud.	Aslynda muny gaty ses bilen aýtmak islemedi.
I don't think so.	Beýle pikir eder öýdemok.
There was another way.	Başga bir ýol bardy.
This was not the case this year.	Bu ýyl beýle däldi.
I knew it would do.	Munuň etjekdigini bilýärdim.
He was with me yesterday.	Ol düýn meniň bilen boldy.
It's been a few days.	Birnäçe gün boldy.
I have to go home.	Men öýe gitmeli.
There is no right way.	Dogry ýol ýok.
This was not surprising.	Bu geň däldi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
It looks just like the current one.	Bu, edil häzirki ýaly görünýär.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Hakykatdanam, ine şu.
That's the way life is.	Bütin durmuş şeýle.
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
He still couldn't see.	Ol henizem görüp bilmedi.
I don't have it anymore.	Indi mende ýok.
I can't say enough about it.	Men bu hakda ýeterlik zat aýdyp biljek däl.
This helped him a lot for the first time.	Bu oňa ilkinji gezek gaty köp kömek etdi.
Just beautiful.	Edil owadan.
Just like he did every morning.	Edil her gün irden eden zady ýaly.
Maybe he and he.	Belki, ol we ol.

You can only be yourself.	Siz diňe özüňiz bolup bilersiňiz.
I've been here a long time.	Men bu ýerde gaty uzak boldum.
He did not want to be called off.	Ol muny gaty ses bilen boýun almak islemedi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I am happy.	Men bagtly.
One thing.	Bir zat.
You have to be smart.	Akylly bolmaly.
I decided.	Men karar berdim.
This is not for you.	Bu seniň üçin däl.
This is for us.	Bu biziň üçin.
What he saw.	Gören zatlary.
What to do	Näme etmeli
Of course not.	Elbetde bolup bilmez.
Too young to know that.	Muny bilmek üçin gaty ýaş.
It helped that way.	Munuň ýaly kömek etdi.
It was also impossible to go.	Şeýle hem gitmek mümkin däldi.
This time he let me.	Ol bu gezek maňa rugsat berdi.
They were not.	Olar beýle däldi.
You are young	Sen ýigit.
Why? 	Näme üçin?

I said it would be.	Boljakdygyny aýtdym.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.

So that's great.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty gowy.
He didn't want to.	Ol muny islemedi.
He did not want to do that.	Ol muny etmek islemedi.

Not once, but twice.	Bir gezek däl, iki gezek.
For many things.	Köp zatlar üçin.
He didn't have to.	Ol hökman däldi.
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle aňsat.
This did not happen.	Bu bolup bilmedi.
Maybe he wants someone else now.	Belki, indi başga birini isleýär.
Why? 	Näme üçin?
So we can hope.	Şonuň üçin umyt edip bileris.
Everyone knew that.	Muny hemmeler bilýärdi.

She still doesn't know.	Ol henizem bilenok.
It was amazing.	Bu ajaýyp däli boldy.
What else is there?	Ol ýerde başga näme bar?

This is a big, big deal.	Bu uly, uly mesele.

This does not seem to be the case.	Bu beýle däl ýaly.
He gave it to her.	Oňa berdi.
Of course, the man wanted to talk.	Elbetde, ol adam gürleşmek isledi.
It seemed very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly ýalydy.

Of course he objected.	Elbetde garşy çykdy.

And then he came back.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp geldi.
He must.	Ol hökman.
It's okay because good things can't happen.	Bolýar, sebäbi gowy zatlar bolup bilmeýär.
This was not a big deal.	Bu kän bir mesele däldi.

He was very upset.	Ol gaty galdy.
He will call later	Soň jaň eder

A little fast.	Biraz çalt.
The message is there.	Habar şol ýerde.

These are two things.	Bu iki zat.

It was too much.	Gaty köp boldy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.

Now it's a problem.	Indi bir mesele.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
He objected.	Ol muňa garşy çykdy.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
So it is difficult.	Şonuň üçin bu kyn.
Maybe two big	Belki, iki uly
This is an easy way.	Bu aňsat ýol.
I'm thinking of calling.	Jaň etmek hakda pikir edýärin.
Good for most people.	Köp adam üçin gowy.
He doesn't seem to be helping himself.	Özüne kömek etjek ýaly däl.
He really likes you.	Ol sizi hakykatdanam halaýar.

I think there are two reasons for this.	Meniň pikirimçe, munuň iki sebäbi bar.
The next big thing.	Indiki uly zat.
He could not go to work.	Ol işe gidip bilmedi.
Now that's the reason.	Indi munuň sebäbi.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
I think this is the right decision.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu düýbünden dogry karar.

This is not true for me.	Bu maňa dogry däl.
They weren't necessarily.	Olar hökman däldi.
I got a little help here for this answer.	Bu jogap üçin şu ýerde biraz kömek aldym.
I saw something very bad.	Men gaty erbet zat gördüm.
I didn’t try with anything, I tried.	Hiç zat bilen synap görmedim, synap gördüm.
This seems very strange.	Bu gaty geň görünýär.

You are good to him	Siz oňa gowy

They are one thing.	Olar bir zat.
Who are you	Sen kim

This is what happens.	Bu şeýle bolýar.
You are the only one who will call me.	Maňa jaň etjek ýeke-täk sen.
I just didn’t do it this year.	Diňe şu ýyl etmedim.
He didn't care about anything.	Ol hiç zat üçin alada etmedi.
They are happy.	Olar bagtly.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu uly zat.
I'm not a bad person.	Men erbet adam däl.
Okay.	Bolýar.
What to do, what to do.	Näme etmeli, näme etmeli.
There was still time to do something.	Entek bir zatlar etmäge wagt bardy.
He could not see it.	Ol muny görüp bilmedi.
To help me.	Maňa kömek etmek üçin.
The man was very difficult.	Adam gaty kyn boldy.
Everyone except me.	Menden başga hemmeler.
I should have known better.	Men has gowy bilýän bolmaly.

Both are here.	Ikisi-de şu ýerde.
It should be the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly bolmaly.
This idea was not new to him at all.	Bu pikir onuň üçin asla täze däldi.
In fact, they are worse off.	Aslynda olar has erbet.
Really interesting.	Hakykatdanam gyzykly.
No problem.	Mesele bolmaz.
There seems to be no one at home.	Öýde hiç kim ýok ýaly.
He didn't have to do that.	Ol beýle etmeli däldi.
Now he had other things to worry about.	Indi onuň başga alada etmeli zatlary bardy.
It doesn't seem to be here.	Bu ýerde zerur däl ýaly.
He agreed.	Ol razy boldy.
She is so young.	Ol şeýle ýaş.

Now he fully understood.	Häzir ol doly düşündi.
He wanted to talk to you very badly.	Ol seniň bilen gaty erbet gürleşmek isledi.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
Now it seems to me more interesting.	Indi bu maňa has gyzykly görünýär.
There was no mention of me.	Men hakda söz ýokdy.
An issue, an idea.	Bir mesele, pikir.
There will be no one else.	Başga hiç kim bolmaz.
You can even do another one.	Hatda başga birini edip bilersiňiz.
Next.	Indiki.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Bu zat oňa bardy.
I thought about things.	Men zatlar hakda pikir etdim.

This is not surprising.	Bu geň zat däl.
That person is really there.	Ol adam hakykatdanam şol ýerde.
It's back.	Gowy gaýdyp geldi.
Now he knows.	Indi bilýär.

Two months ago.	Iki aý mundan ozal.
No wonder.	Hakykatdanam geň zat ýok.
This was not possible with me.	Meniň bilen bu mümkin däldi.
I knew it.	Men muny bilýärdim.
He only cares about you.	Ol diňe sen hakda alada edýär.
This did not help.	Bu kömek etmedi.
Now you	Indi sen.
It's really easy.	Bu hakykatdanam aňsat.
He got it.	Ol muny aldy.
Really bad idea.	Hakykatdanam erbet pikir.
Of course, I can't do anything about it.	Elbetde, munuň bilen hiç zat edip bilemok.
Maybe not tomorrow.	Belki ertir däl.
And that’s not a great thing.	Şeýle hem bu ajaýyp zat däl.
What is this	Bu näme.
Then there is the problem.	Soň bolsa bir mesele bar.
Two days, three days, it's hard to say.	Iki gün, üç gün, muny aýtmak kyn.
What.	Näme.
The problem really wasn't that person.	Hakykatdanam mesele ol adam däldi.
Maybe he's already here.	Belki, ol eýýäm şu ýerde.
That would always be the case.	Elmydama şeýle bolardy.
It will be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolar.
I think there is a lot for us.	Meniň pikirimçe, biziň üçin köp zat bar.
In a few places today.	Bu gün birnäçe ýerde.
She looked so beautiful.	Ol gaty owadan ýalydy.
He went there for a week, the next week.	Ol ýerde bir hepde, indiki hepde gitdi.
He was never going to do that.	Ol muny hiç haçan etjek däldi.
There was no one there but you and me.	Ol ýerde sen we menden başga hiç kim ýokdy.
I heard someone who could help.	Kömek edip biljek birini eşitdim.
I can do a lot with that.	Munuň bilen köp zat edip bilerin.
I had never seen him before.	Ony öň görmedim.
There is another.	Başga biri bar.
I thought what happened.	Näme boldy diýip pikir etdim.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
I don't know what he's doing.	Men onuň näme edýändigini bilemok.
What a thing.	Näme zat.
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat.

He really does something.	Ol hakykatdanam bir iş edýär.
I can say too much.	Gaty köp aýdyp bilerin.
I will be.	Men bolaryn.
The answer will be.	Jogap bolar.
It seemed easy.	Bu aňsat ýalydy.
I thought it was the best thing.	Iň gowy zat diýip pikir etdim.
I just think so. "	Men diňe pikir edýärin "-diýdi.
He bought me a lot.	Ol maňa köp zat satyn aldy.
He thought it was wrong.	Ol dogry däl diýip pikir etdi.
He was there again.	Ol ýerde ýene bardy.
It was never about money.	Bu hiç wagt pul hakda däldi.
This is not a mistake.	Bu hiç hili ýalňyşlyk däl.
He seemed to know about things.	Ol zatlar hakda bilýän ýalydy.
She was wonderful and helped me a lot.	Ol ajaýyp we maňa köp kömek etdi.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
I want to be the last.	Iň soňky bolmak isleýärin.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
It was like crazy.	Bu däli ýalydy.
This statement is incorrect.	Bu söz dogry däl.
And then he could tell her everything.	Soň bolsa oňa hemme zady aýdyp bilýärdi.
Here is another reason.	Ine, başga bir sebäp.
I have to tell you the truth.	Men saňa hakykaty aýtmaly.
Bad news.	Erbet, erbet habar.
Not a single person.	Hiç bir adam däl.
There was no one.	Hiç kim ýokdy.
He wanted that too.	Ol hem muny isledi.
The last volume.	Iň soňky tom.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Muny diňe bir gezek etmeli.
What a wonderful idea.	Nähili ajaýyp pikir.
He asked in a loud voice.	Gaty ses bilen sorady.
It may take time.	Wagt gerek bolup biler.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
That person is very good at home.	Ol adam öýde gaty gowy.
It looks great and looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär we gaty gowy görünýär.
I'll be fine.	Men gowy bolaryn.
I knew one.	Men birini bilýärdim.
Life is what you want it to be.	Durmuş islän zadyň.
He has now returned to that school.	Ol indi şol mekdebe gaýdyp geldi.
Just so weird.	Diňe gaty geň.
He had fun.	Ol hezil etdi.
I am just a man.	Men diňe bir adam.
How good it would be.	Bu nähili gowy bolardy.
It wasn’t really that bad.	Aslynda beýle erbet däldi.
I've only seen it twice.	Men muny diňe iki gezek gördüm.
Now tell me.	Indi aýdyň.
This is a good decision.	Bu gowy karar.
I don't want to help her.	Men oňa kömek etmek islämok.
Life is not like that.	Durmuş beýle däl.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp ýaly görünýär.
I decided on that.	Men muňa karar berdim.
This is certainly not the case.	Bu, elbetde, asla beýle däl.
It's too fast.	Bu gaty çalt.
You must.	Siz hökman.
Probably not.	Mümkin, beýle däl bolsa gerek.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
This year.	Bu ýyl.
You know, but those things happen.	Bilýärsiň, ýöne şol zatlar bolýar.
Everyone still lives together.	Her kim henizem bile ýaşaýar.
I don't know about you, but it makes me want to talk.	Men sen hakda bilemok, ýöne bu meni gürleşmek isleýär.
That would be it.	Ol şeýle bolardy.
It's been a long time.	Köp wagt boldy.
This was not the case with us.	Bu biziň bilen beýle däldi.
It's you.	Bu sen.
The next question.	Indiki sorag.
Everyone already knows that.	Bu hakda eýýäm hemmeler bilýär.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
This is really something.	Bu hakykatdanam bir zat.
This will not always be the case.	Elmydama beýle bolmaz.
It was nice to see him there.	Ony şol ýerde görmek gowy boldy.
I did it once.	Men muny bir gezek etdim.
There was nothing else he could tell her.	Oňa aýdyp biljek başga zat ýokdy.
You have to go now.	Indi gitmeli.
You really have to do that.	Hakykatdanam muny etmeli.
I know what.	Men näme bilýärin.
And then it happens again.	Soň bolsa ýene bolýar.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
That was good.	Ine, gowy boldy.
This was not what he wanted.	Bu onuň isleýän zady däldi.
He can be right.	Ol dogry aýdyp biler.
Therefore.	Şonuň üçin.
Nothing else can happen.	Başga zat bolup bilmez.
There is no way now	Indi ýol ýok
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
I actually had it.	Aslynda mende bardy.
This is something new for them.	Bu olar üçin täze zat.
It should be.	Bu bolmaly.
What is this	Bu näme bolýar.
Someone must have called him to tell him what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny aýtmak üçin kimdir biri oňa jaň eden bolmaly.
He didn't want it.	Ol ony islemedi.
This is another day for you.	Siziň üçin bu başga bir gün.
I believe.	Men ynanýaryn.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
I don't think so.	Başga zat pikir etmeýärin.
It's about you.	Bu sen hakda.
I can't help it	Men kömek edip bilemok
There is some work to be done.	Ol ýerde bir hili işi bar.
It's just crazy.	Bu diňe däli.
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu hakda.
One day he was surprised by this strange reason.	Bir gün bu geň bir sebäp bilen geň galdy.
Every word was hard.	Her söz kyn boldy.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
He could not reach her.	Ol oňa baryp bilmedi.
He was not crazy.	Ol däli däldi.
OK, clear.	Bolýar, aýdyň.
I have a lot to do.	Meniň etmeli köp zadym bar.
Who knows how it happened there.	Ol ýerde nädip bolandygyny kim bilýär.
There was no sound.	Hiç hili ses ýokdy.
That's right- this is not about me.	Ol gaty dogry.
I often think of something like this.	Munuň ýaly zady köplenç pikir edýärin.
She is worried.	Ol alada edýär.
Now.	Indi.
It's a beautiful thing.	Bir owadan zat.
He wants to see you.	Ol seni görmek isleýär.
This is completely strange.	Bu düýbünden geň.
No problem.	Kynçylyk ýok.
Very likely to be interesting.	Gyzykly bolmagy gaty ähtimal.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
Everything is there.	Hemme zat şol ýerde.
Not much.	Köp zat däl.
It will never be and will never be.	Hiç haçan bolmaz we bolmaz.
I have to stop doing that.	Men muny etmegi bes etmeli.
Now everything is clear.	Indi hemme zat aýdyň boldy.
Word.	Söz.
Now tell me.	Indi aýdyň.
Not surprisingly there.	Ol ýerde kän bir geň däl.
Not a bad person.	Erbet adam däl.
No one did because no one was there.	Hiç kim etmedi, sebäbi ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
It was the same as before.	Öňküsi ýalydy.
Someone knows that very well.	Biri gaty gowy bilýär.
Money, money, money	Pul, pul, pul
He is completely insane.	Ol düýbünden däli.
It was like that.	Bu onuň ýalydy.
This is absolutely beautiful.	Bu düýbünden owadan.
It was so crazy.	Bu gaty däli boldy.
I do not believe so.	Men beýle ynanamok.
These are not two people.	Bu iki adam däl.
This is what I want.	Bu meniň isleýän zadym.
I didn't really think about it.	Men bu hakda hakykatdanam pikir etmedim.
No one knows.	Muny hiç kim bilenok.
I couldn't hurt him.	Men oňa zyýan berip bilmedim.
Last year was a very difficult year for me.	Geçen ýyl meniň üçin gaty kyn ýyl boldy.
It was impossible to say.	Muny aýtmak mümkin däldi.
I think that's a good thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy zat.
It was great.	Uly ýalydy.
I'm not that girl.	Men ol gyz däl.
If necessary, you.	Gerek bolsa, siz.
It should be the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly bolmaly.
I only have two questions.	Mende diňe iki sorag bar.
The police already exist.	Polisiýa eýýäm bar.
He knew full well.	Ol muny doly bilýärdi.
He will think a lot.	Ol köp pikir eder.
A lot has happened.	Köp zat boldy.
In fact, he had no business here.	Hakykatdanam, bu ýerde onuň işi ýokdy.
I want to talk about you.	Men sen hakda gürleşmek isleýärin.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I can't help you	Men size kömek edip bilemok
I decided.	Men karar berdim.
For help	Kömek üçin
.	.
Nothing seems to be true or complete.	Hakykatdanam hiç zat dogry ýa-da doly däl ýaly.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
No one ever wanted to do anything.	Hiç kim asla hiç zat etmek islemedi.
That may be enough for me.	Bu meniň üçin ýeterlik bolup biler.
Money is time.	Pul wagt.
It helped.	Bu kömek etdi.
No sound.	Ses ýok.
That's great.	Bu uly.
I was busy.	Men meşgul boldum.
They are right there.	Olar edil şol ýerde.
I have something.	Mende bir zat bar.
Not much time.	Wagt köp däl.
He gave me good news.	Ol maňa gowy habar berdi.
Just a matter of time.	Diňe bir mesele.
Maybe this is also the case.	Belki bu hem bolup biler.
It may be great.	Bu onuň ajaýyp bolmagy mümkin.
Anything can happen.	Hemme zat bolup biler.
I really believe that.	Men muňa hakykatdanam ynanýaryn.
We had hope.	Bize umyt bardy.
Me	Ine
I'm not against it.	Men muňa garşy däl.
Of course you are.	Elbetde, sen ýigit.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ýok.
Not interesting anymore.	Indi gyzykly däl.
bar.	bar.
So no one wanted it.	Şonuň üçin hiç kim ony islemedi.
Isn't that the right way to go?	Bu, dogry ýol dälmi?
That's right.	Bu dogry.
No one else knows about such things.	Beýle zatlar hakda başga hiç kim bilenok.
He has done this several times.	Ol muny birnäçe gezek etdi.
I know this is not an easy task.	Munuň aňsat iş däldigini bilýärin.
The question is.	Sorag şeýle.
This is often not the case.	Köplenç beýle däl.
I do this a lot.	Men muny köp edýärin.
You have to do this often.	Muny köplenç etmeli.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
It will be up to you.	Bu saňa bolar.
I'll take care of you.	Men saňa alada ederin.
He didn't need it.	Oňa mätäç däldi.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
He didn't say anything to me.	Ol maňa hiç zat aýtmady.
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa ýol bermedi.
Who are you	Sen kim
He didn't either.	Ol hem etmedi.
He said meat together.	Bilelikde et diýdi.

This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He did not say anything about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat aýtmady.
No money.	Pul ýok.
We are there.	Biz şol ýerde.
There was a problem with that.	Bu barada birneme kynçylyk bardy.
In fact, it has been around for some time.	Aslynda, ol birnäçe wagt bäri bardy.
This is often the case.	Bu köplenç beýle däldi.
No one else can.	Başga hiç kim edip bilmez.
In fact, it is more likely.	Hakykatdanam, bu has ähtimal.
I think that could be the problem.	Bu mesele bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
It shouldn't be.	Bolmaly däl.
He will come.	Geler.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu mesele şu ýerde.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
This is not interesting to me.	Bu meniň üçin gyzykly däl.
I was like that.	Men şeýle boldum.
He must.	Ol hökman.
I know he can.	Biljekdigini bilýärin.
Such damage.	Şeýle zyýan.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
Every year is beautiful.	Her ýyl owadan.
It took a long time.	Bu gaty köp wagt aldy.
They are not just there.	Olar diňe ol ýerde däl.
This is a very difficult issue.	Hakykatdanam gaty kyn mesele.
There should never have been a question.	Hiç haçan sorag bolmaly däldi.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Everything was there.	Hemme zady bardy.
He did not want to know.	Ol bilmek islemedi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Same thing.	Edil şol bir zat.
I have money.	Ine pul.
He doesn't know about me.	Ol meniň hakda bilmeýär.
It seems right to me.	Maňa dogry ýaly görünýär.
That would be nice.	Bu gowy bolardy.
Someone else was always there.	Başga biri hemişe bardy.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
I hoped there would be a book to do that.	Muny etjek kitap bolar diýip umyt etdim.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
Sorry, but he is.	Bagyşlaň, ýöne ol.
It could be here.	Bu ýerde bolup biler.
How was that? 	Bu nähili boldy?
It made it very bad.	Muny gaty erbet etdi.
Hurry up	Çalt et.
It was a good idea.	Gowy pikir boldy.
It would be better there.	Ol ýerde has gowy bolardy.
No one wanted to buy those things.	Hiç kim ol zatlary satyn almak islemedi.
I'm fast.	Men çalt.
Of course you can.	Elbetde edip bilersiňiz.
You're crazy right now.	Sen şu wagt däli.
I knew it was never going to happen.	Munuň indi ýa-da hiç wagt däldigini bilýärdim.
No one could.	Hiç kim edip bilmedi.
Now he is gone.	Indi ol gitdi.
It was a good day.	Bu gowy gün boldy.
Of course, this is a very good thing.	Elbetde, bu gaty gowy zat.
We can't do that	Muny edip bilmeris
So something else can happen.	Şonuň üçin başga bir zat bolup biler.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
It started.	Ol başlady.
He knew that too.	Muny hem bilýärdi.
This is not a book.	Bu kitap däl.
I thought it was good.	Bu gowy diýip pikir etdim.
This is a really good thing.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy zat.
If you need it, you will need it.	Size gerek bolsa, size gerek bolar.
This is an easy thing to do.	Bu etmek aňsat zat.
If not today, tomorrow.	Bu gün däl bolsa, ertir.
This is no longer the case.	Bu indi beýle däl.
This is not a big deal, but a big one.	Bu uly mesele däl, ýöne bir mesele.
I was not alone.	Men ýeke däldim.
Good book.	Gowy kitap.
He did well.	Gowy etdi.
He said.	Diýdi.

I can't answer that for you.	Men size bu barada jogap berip bilemok.
You need a lot of things.	Size köp zat gerek.
They go early.	Olar ir.
I don't like what happened here.	Bu ýerde bolup geçen zatlary halamok.
Maybe that helped.	Belki bu kömek etdi.
I think that’s complete.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu doly.
I don't think so.	Beýle bolar öýdemok.
He thought I had taken you.	Men seni aldym, diýip pikir etdi.
You are now yourself.	Siz indi özüňiz.
So not only that.	Şonuň üçin diňe bir däl.
They have to agree.	Olar razy bolmaly.
You need to be with this person.	Bu adam bilen bile bolmak gerek.
You have to do this for me.	Muny meniň üçin etmeli.
This girl can't be.	Bu gyz bolup bilmez.
It's coming now.	Indi gelýär.
A few years later he went to work for me.	Birnäçe ýyl soň ol ​​meniň üçin işe gitdi.
It was as if he had nothing to do with it.	Bu onuň hiç bir işi däl ýalydy.
This is a great day for me.	Bu meniň üçin ajaýyp gün.

I can't say anything else right now.	Şu wagt başga zat aýdyp biljek däl.
He was no longer human.	Ol indi adam däldi.
And you can be just like us.	Siz bolsa edil biziň ýaly bolup bilersiňiz.
He told me that.	Ol maňa muny aýtdy.
Everything is there.	Hemme zat şol ýerde.
I have a better idea.	Mende has gowy pikir bar.

And then another one.	Soň bolsa başga biri.
Something new.	Täze zat.

I am for this.	Men munuň üçin.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle.
I care about myself.	Men özüm hakda alada edýärin.
This will not be true.	Bu dogry bolmaz.
I'm just worried.	Men diňe bir biynjalyk.
We are not enough for you.	Biz siziň üçin ýeterlik däl.
He wanted to go to work.	Ol işe gitmek isledi.
It's too fast.	Ol gaty çalt.
Of course, that's just me.	Elbetde, bu diňe men.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmek hökman däl.
It was hard to buy.	Satyn almak kyn boldy.
We need to rest.	Biz dynç almaly.
I think that's what it is.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu näme.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He was not crazy.	Ol däli däldi.
You are serious.	Siz çynlakaý.
In fact for several years.	Aslynda birnäçe ýyl.
The next one is the next one.	Indiki we indiki.
So easy and fast.	Şeýle aňsat we çalt.

Oh, he said.	Aý, ol aýtdy.

We can't say that.	Muny aýdyp bilmeris.
He just knows it.	Ol muny diňe bilýär.

The problem is for me.	Mesele meniň üçin.
The police are coming.	Polisiýa gelýär.
You can see that.	Muny görüp bilersiňiz.
It really happened.	Bu hakykatdanam boldy.
Not only that, but everywhere.	Diňe bu däl, hemme ýerde.
Many people.	Köp adam.
This is the last week.	Bu soňky hepde.
You can be right, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Dogry aýdyp bilersiňiz "-diýdi.
No one is like me to you.	Hiç kim meniň üçin seniň ýaly däl.
It doesn't even have to be something.	Hatda bir zat bolmak hökman däl.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
The sun.	Gün.
Couldn't help it.	Oňa kömek edip bilmedi.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
Many good things come.	Köp gowy zatlar gelýär.
He will too.	Ol hem eder.
It's not good to be that guy.	Şol ýigit bolmak gowy däl.
You have to go long and fast.	Uzak, çalt gitmeli.
They are not at home.	Olar öýde däl.
I'm not smart enough.	Men ýeterlik akylly däl.
Often this is true.	Köplenç bu dogry.
You know the future.	Geljek ýaly bilýärsiň.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle etmedi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
The reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi.
There is something very strange here.	Bu ýerde gaty geň bir zat bar.
No one knew what could happen.	Näme bolup biljekdigini hiç kim bilmeýärdi.
It's hard to see.	Muny görmek size kyn.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
This and only that.	Bu we diňe.
I still don't believe it.	Bu iş hakda henizem ynanamok.
One hour left.	Bir sagat galdy.
You are so beautiful.	Siz gaty ajaýyp.
If possible.	Bu mümkin bolsa.
It was not good to see.	Görmek gowy däldi.
It was not an easy decision.	Bu aňsat karar däldi.
The reason is me.	Munuň sebäbi men.
He has to tell me what to do.	Ol maňa näme etmelidigimi aýtmaly.
She is so young and beautiful and.	Ol şeýle ýaş we owadan we.
I just do it and that's it.	Men diňe edýärin we bu.
They are completely different things.	Olar düýbünden başga zatlar.
It's really hard to say.	Muny hakykatdanam aýtmak kyn.
Because he didn't do that.	Sebäbi ol beýle etmedi.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
The timing is great.	Wagty gaty gowy.
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýok.
I have no answer.	Mende jogap ýok.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
You have to help.	Kömek etmeli.
It's not just about you.	Bu diňe sen hakda däl.
There were good things too.	Gowy zatlar hem boldy.
He did it for me.	Ol muny maňa etdi.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
Now it's a bit.	Häzir ol birneme.
Someone else is gone.	Başga biri gitdi.
Ma'am.	Bu.
She is not happy.	Ol bagtly däl.
Life is hard.	Durmuş kyn.
It's me and you.	Bu men we sen.
No one will object to that.	Hiç kim muňa garşy bolmaz.
That would be nice.	Bu gowy bolar.
Probably.	Mümkin.
This is not just for me.	Bu diňe meniň üçin däl.
So there are some weird things going on here.	Şonuň üçin bu ýerde gaty geň zatlar bar.
I did.	Men etdim.
I decided.	Men karar berdim.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, indi beýle bolmaz.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
You have to go home.	Öýe gitmeli.
Long enough for something else to happen.	Başga bir zadyň bolmagy üçin ýeterlik uzak.
And he wants to be like them.	We olar ýaly bolmak isleýär.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
He said.	Ol şeýle diýdi.
Here for life.	Durmuş üçin şu ýerde.
It's been a long time.	Bu uzak wagt.
I can't say why right now.	Näme üçin edil şu wagt aýdyp biljek däl.
Of course.	Elbetde.
That's exactly what happens.	Ine, edil şeýle bolýar.
A lot of people do that.	Köp adam muny edýär.
Here he goes.	Ine, ol gitdi.
Not tomorrow either.	Ertir hem däl.
Somewhere	Bir ýerde.
Of course, he doesn't want to see us.	Elbetde, ol bizi görmek islemeýär.
He could not speak.	Ol gürläp bilmedi.
I didn't think much.	Men kän pikir etmedim.
Not much.	Kän däl.
Advice on things.	Zatlar hakda maslahat bermek.
It's very easy and fast.	Bu gaty aňsat we çalt.
I had to give it to him.	Men oňa bermeli boldum.
I can help.	Kömek edip bilerin.
Okay, maybe really right now.	Bolýar, belki hakykatdanam şu wagt.
I couldn't help it.	Men oňa kömek edip bilmedim.
This is very crazy.	Bu gaty däli.
That's the way it is now.	Häzir şeýle.
They really are.	Olar hakykatdanam.
He offered it to me.	Ol maňa teklip etdi.
He destroyed it.	Ol ony ýok etdi.
It was also not beautiful.	Şeýle hem owadan däldi.
Nothing can be done for him.	Onuň üçin hiç zat edip bolmaz.
Maybe you should relax.	Belki, dynç almaly.
We can't take it anymore.	Biz indi alyp bilmeris.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
This is the only one.	Bu ýeke-täk.
Now he could do nothing.	Indi ol hiç zat edip bilmedi.
He could not speak.	Ol gürläp bilmedi.
Tom thought.	Tom, pikir etdi.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
This can happen.	Bu zat bolup biler.
He did not decide.	Ol karar bermedi.
As good as new.	Täze ýaly gowy.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
She was like a girl to herself.	Ol özüne gyz ýalydy.
You don't have to do anything else.	Başga bir zat etmeli däl.
Not now, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Häzir däl "-diýdi.
I saw it now.	Men indi gördüm.
This is not the case.	Bu iş däl.
This is the problem.	Mesele şu.
I don't know why he does that.	Näme üçin beýle edýändigini bilemok.
In fact, the idea did not say anything about them.	Aslynda, pikir olar hakda hiç zat aýtmady.
I want to	Men isleýärin
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
You could say something else.	Siz entek başga bir zat diýip bilersiňiz.
The word is there, but not enough.	Söz şol ýerde, ýöne ýeterlik däl.
He also could not see her.	Şeýle hem, ony görüp bilmedi.
It was nothing.	Bu hiç zat däldi.
There is hard work.	Kyn işi bar.
More for the next person.	Indiki adam üçin has köp zat.
About it.	Bu hakda.
It wasn't that bad.	Bu beýle erbet däldi.
I don't believe it.	Men oňa ynanamok.
That's a lot.	Bu köp.
This was not news.	Bu habar däldi.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
Well, man.	Gowy, adam.
You know	Bilýärsiň.
This is very easy for many people.	Köp adam üçin bu gaty aňsat.
This is not a big deal.	Bu uly mesele däl.
Of course, that was for me.	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin boldy.
That's right- this is not about you.	Dogry bolsa, siziň üçin gaty gowy.
He wanted to be closer now.	Ol indi ýakyn bolmak isledi.
The last few years.	Soňky birnäçe ýyl.
He could not go.	Ol gidip bilmedi.
Of course it takes time, but it helps.	Elbetde wagt gerek, ýöne kömek edýär.
This is not the case.	Bu iş däl.
Always, always, there was someone else there.	Elmydama, elmydama, ol ýerde başga biri bardy.
I offered to help her, but she refused.	Men oňa kömek etmegi teklip etdim, ýöne ol maňa rugsat bermedi.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
Someone gave it to me.	Kimdir biri maňa berdi.
It really helps.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek edýär.
This is probably not the case today.	Häzirki wagtda beýle däl bolsa gerek.
You really shouldn't report it here.	Hakykatdanam bu ýerde habar bermeli däl.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke-täk däldi.
Not to be outdone.	Üns bermeli däl.
It's kind of.	Bu bir hili.
He never wants to go anywhere or do anything.	Ol hiç haçan hiç ýere gitmek ýa-da bir zat etmek islemeýär.
It could be that.	Munuň ýaly bolmagy mümkin.
A few years ago.	Birnäçe ýyl mundan ozal.
This is now possible.	Bu indi mümkin.
It will.	Bu eder.
Really	Hakykatdanam
There is no one to help her.	Oňa kömek etjek hiç kim ýok.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I did it.	Men muny etdim.
We are not human.	Biz adam däl.
This will never happen.	Bu hiç haçan bolmaz.
Nothing big.	Uly zat ýok.
Long time no see	Uzak wagt
It's only been a month.	Bu diňe bir aý boldy.
He must have done this a few years ago.	Ol muny birnäçe ýyl ozal eden bolmaly.
I can still see it.	Men henizem ony görüp bilýärin.
It can't be, but it really is.	Bu bolup bilmez, ýöne hakykatdanam şeýle.
He can do that.	Ol muny edip biler.
No one gave me anything.	Hiç kim maňa hiç zat bermedi.
They appear.	Olar görünýär.
That's the way it is.	Ine, şeýle bolar.
It's a bad night.	Bu erbet gije.
Now there is.	Indi bar.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty owadan.
I think that's a good thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy zat.
I am here every night.	Men her gije şu ýerde.
No worries.	Hiç hili alada ýok.
I have to tell you now.	Indi maňa aýtmaly.
Only you and me.	Diňe sen we men.
I believe it can be done.	Edip boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
I worry about the future.	Geljek hakda alada edýärin.
You are in the right place.	Siz dogry ýerde.
Ma'am.	Bu.
He doesn't have to decide.	Ol karar bermeli däl.
I didn't want to do that.	Muny etmek islemedim.
Damage knows that.	Zyýan muny bilýär.
I didn't see you and.	Men seni görmedim we.
It wasn't enough.	Oňa ýeterlik däldi.
They are very good.	Olar gaty gowy.
Both are this year.	Ikisi-de şu ýyl.
I think she is happy.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol bagtly.
I told her what had happened.	Men oňa näme bolandygyny aýtdym.
Who knows.	Kim bilýär.
I don't think there is a question about that.	Bu hakda sorag ýok öýdemok.
Then he went to work.	Soň bolsa işe gitdi.
He can't do it again.	Ol muny ýene edip bilmeýär.
Here he is.	Ine, ol kim.
I didn't think so.	Beýle eder öýdemokdym.
Why	Näme üçin
He is as good as anyone.	Ol hemmeler ýaly gowy.
I don't know about him.	Men ol hakda bilemok.
Who knows, maybe.	Kim bilýär, bolup biler.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I did and I did.	Men etdim we etdim.
That's a good thing.	Aslynda gowy zat.
It was good for him.	Bu oňa gowy boldy.
Good with me.	Gowy meniň bilen.
Not so good either.	Şeýle hem beýle bir gowy däl.
It was not like that.	Bu pikir ýaly däldi.
Not much.	Kän däl.
What is happening is not right.	Bolýan zatlar dogry däl.
I don't think it's possible.	Mümkin däl öýdemok.
Nothing can be so easy.	Hiç zat beýle aňsat bolup bilmez.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
You can suggest this.	Muny teklip edip bilersiňiz.
How?	Nädip?
The only problem is, it doesn't exist yet.	Diňe kynçylyk, ol entek ýok.
He wanted to do it.	Ol muny etjek boldy.
Good.	Gowy.
He has to go.	Ol gitmeli.
This is better.	Bu has gowy.
Seriously.	Çynlakaý iş.
He was not.	Özi ýokdy.
Too much indeed.	Hakykatdanam gaty köp.
Long time no see	Köp wagt.
This is absolutely necessary.	Bu düýbünden zerur.
There is no one to call her.	Oňa jaň etjek adam ýok.
That's exactly what happened.	Bu edil şeýle boldy.
This is not the case with me.	Bu meniň bilen beýle däl.
I can never do that.	Men muny asla edip bilemok.
You are the last	Sen iň soňky
He called me.	Ol maňa jaň etdi.
It didn't hurt you.	Ol size zyýan bermedi.
Like him, he was no longer young.	Onuň ýaly, ol indi ýaş däldi.
He immediately asked for help.	Derrew kömek sorady.
He was no longer against it.	Ol indi muňa garşy däldi.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
They are completely different.	Olar düýbünden başga.
This will not be the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek bolmaz.
He didn't know it.	Ol muny bilmeýärdi.
No one does that.	Hiç kim muny etmeýär.
Good, very good.	Gowy, gaty gowy.
Life is so weird.	Durmuş şeýle geň.
Last year was an interesting year.	Geçen ýyl gyzykly ýyl.
He knew exactly what he was thinking.	Ol hakykatdanam näme pikir edýändigini bilýärdi.
He wants the truth.	Ol hakykaty isleýär.
This year will not be.	Bu ýyl bolmaz.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň zady.
I'm worried right now.	Men şu wagt alada edýärin.
They were not for me.	Olar meniň üçin ýokdy.
It would have been easier for him.	Bu onuň üçin has aňsat bolardy.
I enjoyed it.	Men lezzet aldym.
Everything would be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolardy.
Maybe one day.	Belki bir gün.
Good job for him.	Oňa gowy iş.
I really care a lot.	Men hakykatdanam köp alada edýärin.
Oh right.	Aý, dogry.
He said he did not think so.	Dogry pikir etmeýändigini aýtdy.
It will be.	Ol bolar.
In fact, there must be no word.	Aslynda söz ýok bolmaly.
Good way	Gowy ýol.
What? 	Näme?
Of course.	Elbetde.
he says.	ol aýdýar.
We have to go.	Biz gitmeli.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bolýar soňky sorag.
I don't want to go	Men gitmek islämok
Something better for us.	Biziň üçin has gowy zat.
Maybe that's the problem.	Belki, bu mesele.
It's like a guy.	Bu ýigit ýaly.
Bad.	Erbet.
Not very good for anything else.	Başga zat üçin kän gowy däl.
Of course not.	Elbetde ýok.
I want to help.	Kömek etmek isleýärin.
Therefore.	Şonuň üçin.
Tell me something.	Maňa bir zat aýdyň.
I am very good.	Men gaty gowy.
Now he could not do that.	Indi ol muny edip bilmedi.
How about that?	Bu hakda nähili?
I want to do better.	Men has gowy etmek isleýärin.
In fact, he is not.	Aslynda ol ýok.
It was difficult for him.	Bu oňa kyn boldy.
Did he answer?	Ol jogap berdi?
He got it.	Ol aldy.
Last week didn't seem to be enough.	Geçen hepde ýeterlik däl ýaly.
We are very good, but not enough.	Biz gaty gowy, ýöne ýeterlik däl.
There were two or three people.	Iki ýa-da üç adam bardy.
There is only one way.	Diňe bir ýol bar.
I can take myself home.	Men özümi öýe alyp bilerin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, edil şonuň ýaly.
You have to go for two days.	Iki gün gitmeli.
Every time it seemed like a worse idea.	Her gezek has erbet pikir ýalydy.
Just being with him.	Diňe onuň bilen bolmak.
No one really knows everything.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam hemme zady bilmeýär.
This is not much.	Bu kän däl.
I called again.	Men ýene bir gezek jaň etdim.
I'm so scared.	Men gaty gorkýaryn.
And then he thought it was impossible.	Soň bolsa mümkin däl diýip pikir etdi.
no	ýok.
This is not a bad thing.	Bu gaty erbet däl.
Every day	Her gün.
That would be the worst case scenario.	Bu, iň erbet zat bolardy.
That's a good idea.	Bu gaty gowy pikir.
This is not a bad thing.	Bu gaty erbet däl.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
It's been a few days.	Birnäçe gün boldy.
That's it.	Bu olar.
It actually looks the same as before.	Aslynda edil öňküsi ýaly görünýär.
In fact, it can be very clever.	Aslynda bu gaty akylly bolup biler.
I think they still exist.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar henizem bar.
I hope someone can help.	Kimdir biri kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
So it was very interesting.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty gyzykly boldy.
There is no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýok.
Not a bit.	Biraz däl.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
Ma'am.	Bu.
There is no good guy, no bad guy.	Gowy ýigit ýok, hemmeler erbet adam.
This should not be the case.	Bu mesele bolmaly däl.
I heard that.	Muny eşitdim.
It's been three years.	Üç ýyl boldy.
Now it's easier to go.	Indi gitmek has aňsat.
He described it as a challenge.	Ol muny kynçylyk ýaly aýtdy.
It's just me.	Bu diňe meniň bilen bir zat.
He did nothing to leave.	Ol gitmek üçin hiç zat etmedi.
It was good to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy boldy.
Good.	Gowy.
Mon.	Sen.
He said.	Ol şeýle diýdi.
I trust you	Men saňa ynanýaryn.
I really don't want to	Men hakykatdanam islämok
I think faster than you.	Men senden has çalt pikir edýärin.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.
I want to do that	Men muny etmek isleýärin
Maybe nothing will happen.	Belki hiç zat bolmaz.
Definitely a great time and will definitely do it again.	Elbetde ajaýyp wagt we hökman ýene bir gezek eder.
He could not speak.	Ol gürläp bilmedi.
It may even disappear.	Ol hatda ýok bolmagy hem mümkin.
I'll be right back.	Men çalt bolaryn.
There seemed to be no help for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili kömek ýok ýalydy.
You don't need help.	Size kömek gerek däl.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
No more questions.	Indi sorag ýok.
As it happens.	Bolýan ýaly.
In fact, it is not possible.	Aslynda beýle mümkin däl.
It could be worse.	Has erbet bolup biler.
Nothing anymore.	Indi ýok zat.
He will worry about it.	Ol muny biynjalyk eder.
They weren't that big.	Olar beýle uly däldi.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
What will I do with them?	Olar bilen näme etjek?
There was no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýokdy.
There can be no reason.	Sebäbi bolup bilmez.
Often more.	Köplenç has köp.
This is good news.	Bu gowy habar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gaty bir zat.
Okay.	Bolýar.
He could not do it at all.	Ol düýbünden edip bilmedi.
This time it was.	Bu wagt şeýle boldy.
He told you.	Ol saňa aýtdy.
And how long will it take.	We näçe wagt gerek bolar.
He helped me.	Ol maňa kömek etdi.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
This is a very bad thing.	Bu gaty erbet zat.
And the present.	We häzirki.
I'm at home.	Men öýde.
I was on my way.	Men ýol boldum.
He had been there before, but only once.	Ol öňem bardy, ýöne diňe bir gezek.
Dinner time.	Nahar wagty.
He never did and never will.	Hiç haçan etmedi we bolmaz.
We are not very stupid here.	Biz bu ýerde gaty samsyk däl.
We cannot tell the truth now.	Häzir hakykaty aýdyp bilmeris.
That day	Şol gün.
There is nothing new here.	Bu ýerde täze zat ýok.
There is very good meat there.	Ol ýerde gaty gowy et bar.
Nothing to worry about.	Alada etmeli zat ýok.
It's harder to do that now.	Indi muny etmek has kyn.
That person is not me.	Ol adam men däl.
I trust him a lot.	Men oňa köp ynanýaryn.
You are with me	Sen meniň bilen
There was nothing new about him.	Ol ýerde oňa täze zat ýokdy.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolardy.
Now it would be something.	Indi bu bir zat bolardy.
Not much.	Köp däl.
No one is coming for you.	Hiç kim seniň üçin gelenok.
We are happy.	Biz bagtly.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
Only here and here and now.	Diňe şu we şu ýerde we häzir.
Maybe he didn't.	Belki, beýle etmedi.
I did it again.	Men ýene etdim.
Gone a few hours ago.	Birnäçe sagat ozal gitdi.
I had enough.	Mende ýeterlik zat bardy.
You have to be very close.	Siz gaty ýakyn bolmaly.
It's not just me.	Bu diňe men däl.
We are both one.	Ikimizem bir.
There is nothing you can do about it.	Ony islän zadyny alyp biljek zat ýok.
It was the best fun ever.	Iň gowy gyzykly boldy.
I'm the one who can make her happy.	Men ony bagtly edip biljek adam.
You can get it there, but it doesn't.	Ony şol ýerde alyp bilersiňiz, ýöne ýok.
Bad things happen.	Erbet zatlar bolýar.
It was not for him.	Bu onuň üçin däldi.
She is truly wonderful.	Ol hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
He took me home.	Ol meni öýüne alyp gitdi.
I told you.	Men saňa aýtdym.
Everyone knows what to do.	Her kim näme etmelidigini bilýär.
They are just fun.	Olar diňe gyzykly.
They are absolutely necessary.	Olar düýbünden zerur zatlar.
I believe that now.	Men muňa häzir ynanýaryn.
Why vote?	Näme üçin ses bermeli?
There is a lot to know here.	Bu ýerde bilmek üçin köp zat bar.
Oh! 	Aý!
et, et	et, et
So there is a long way to go.	Şonuň üçin gaty uzak ýol bar.
That's all there is to it.	Munuň özi bar.
We can even see things that don't exist.	Hatda ýok zatlary hem görüp bileris.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
And then he comes back.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp gelýär.
This is what happened to him.	Bu onuň üçin şeýle boldy.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
? 	?
Great and great in your opinion.	Siziň pikiriňizçe ajaýyp we ajaýyp.
No wonder there.	Ol ýerde geň zat ýok.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
There was a lot of work.	Iş köp boldy.
He took her home.	Öýüne alyp gitdi.
I really can't help you	Men hakykatdanam size kömek edip bilemok
It has been around for a long time.	Köp wagt bäri bardy.
Time for man.	Adam üçin wagt.
She thought of herself as beautiful.	Owadan, özi hakda pikir etdi.
That's it.	Ol şol.
This time it's different.	Bu gezek başga.
I don't think you're good.	Meniň pikirimçe, sen gowy däl.
That's what happened.	Ol şeýle boldy.
How is that	Bu nähili?
Now or never thought.	Indi ýa-da hiç haçan pikir etmedi.
I don't know anything	Men hiç zat bilemok
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
This is bad.	Bu erbet.
It was as if he didn't know.	Bilmeýän ýalydy.
Can anyone help me?	Maňa kömek edip biljek barmy?
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolmaz.
What you really need to do is better.	Hakykatdanam etmeli zatlary has gowy.
Maybe not so good.	Belki beýle gowy däl.
She knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Ol ony bagtly etmejekdigini bilýärdi.
He lives here.	Ol şu ýerde ýaşaýar.
This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
I can see now.	Men indi görüp bilýärin.
He never wanted me.	Ol meni asla islemedi.
It was for me.	Bu meniň üçin boldy.
I'm such a bad girl.	Men şeýle erbet gyz.
He doesn't want to go with me.	Ol meniň bilen gitmek islemeýär.
He often had only a few hours left.	Köplenç oňa birnäçe sagat galdy.
He had something to go home.	Öýüne gitmeli bir zady bardy.
I bought one	Birini satyn aldym
This is the first issue.	Bu ilkinji mesele.
These are very bad things.	Bu gaty erbet zatlar.
Just interesting.	Diňe gyzykly.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.

I think this is a great idea.	Bu ajaýyp pikir diýip pikir edýärin.
Because it is no more.	Sebäbi indi ýok.
He did not want to think about it.	Ol bu hakda pikir etmek islemedi.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däl.
To answer.	Jogap bermek.
You have to buy me	Meni satyn almaly
New life in a new place.	Täze ýerde täze durmuş.
Then another good day, another good day.	Soň ýene bir gowy gün, ýene bir gowy gün.

Now he didn't know if he wanted to or not.	Indi ol isleýändigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilmedi.

It was great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy boldy.
I just couldn’t do it that day.	Men diňe şol gün edip bilmedim.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Many people do.	Köp adam edýär.

He is crazy.	Ol däli.

No need.	Gerek däl.
In fact, I don't want to talk about it.	Aslynda bu hakda gürleşmek islämok.
It was not a night.	Bir gije däldi.

Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
Because he is wonderful.	Sebäbi ol ajaýyp.
There is a year to go.	Munuň üçin bir ýyl bar.
He is someone.	Ol kimdir biri.
He came.	Ol geldi.
Ir bar.	Ir bar.
The problem is here.	Mesele şu ýerde gelýär.
No question.	Bu sorag ýok.
That's it.	Boldy.
It would be really nice to see him.	Ony görmek hakykatdanam gowy bolardy.
We are alone now.	Biz indi ýeke.
Last but not least	Iň soňky
There is no other reason.	Başga sebäp ýok.
You can do that.	Muny edip bilersiňiz.
He was not going to do it.	Ol muny etjek däldi.
It was new to me.	Bu meniň üçin täze boldy.
I didn't even try.	Hatda synap görmedim.
Just one thing.	Diňe bir zat.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
He knew he would never fall asleep.	Ol hiç wagt uklap bilmejekdigini bilýärdi.
It took a while.	Biraz wagt gerek boldy.
Not about that.	Bu hakda däl.
Adult.	Uly adam.
We, we, we.	Biz, biz, biz.
No one wants that.	Hiç kim muny islemeýär.
No word yet.	Bu wagt söz ýok.
A month, maybe more.	Bir aý, belki has köp.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
OK and.	Bolýar we.
Couldn't buy it.	Ony satyn alyp bilmedi.
You have to do that	Muny etmeli
So it was very worrying.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty biynjalyk boldy.
There were three messages.	Üç habar bardy.

In fact, he was not.	Aslynda ol däldi.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.

He is like me.	Ol meniň ýaly.
This and that.	Bu we şu.
It's really nice to see her.	Aslynda ony görmek hakykatdanam gowy.
That should not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däldi.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
It was like something else.	Bu başga zat ýalydy.
He was surprised to see me.	Ol meni görüp geň galdy.
This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
Maybe a little too much.	Belki birneme gaty köp bolsa gerek.
This is even more strange.	Bu has geň.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I know what happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilýärin.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Muny diňe bir gezek etmeli.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
Now tell me what happened.	Indi näme bolandygyny aýdyň.
Not just yet.	Diňe entek däl.
Someone needs to help him.	Kimdir biri oňa kömek bermeli.
I'm not that guy.	Men ol ýigit däl.
Because no one else can.	Sebäbi başga hiç kim edip bilmez.
It's somewhere.	Ol bir ýerde.
He wants to talk to you.	Ol siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýär.
Right here.	Edil şu ýerde.
I have something.	Mende bir zat bar.
There is bad news.	Erbet habar bar.
It was not difficult, it was not difficult.	Bu kyn däl, kyn däldi.
It seemed so close.	Bu gaty ýakyn ýalydy.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
This has been true for some time.	Bu birnäçe wagt bäri dogry bolup gelýär.
There is no such thing at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda beýle zat ýok.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
If there was a problem, they had to call immediately.	Mesele bar bolsa, derrew jaň etmeli boldy.
And that's it.	We şol.
Did he do something?	Ol bir zatlar etdi?
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.

It's not just about being.	Diňe bolmak ýok.
It also looks very beautiful.	Bu hem gaty owadan görünýär.
He would have been here before.	Ol öňem şu ýerde bolardy.
We can only do this once.	Muny diňe bir gezek edip bileris.
This is more for me.	Bu meniň üçin has köp zat.
It could be money.	Bu pul bolup biler.
It's too short.	Bu gaty gysga.
I can't really tell you.	Men saňa hakykatdanam aýdyp biljek däl.
Actually about the two of us.	Aslynda ikimiz hakda.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I do not mind.	Men garşy däl.
This is not true and it is not.	Bu dogry däl we dogry däl.
Now he can do whatever he wants, he can do whatever he wants.	Indi islän zadyny edip biler, islän zadyny edip biler.
It really was tonight.	Ol hakykatdanam şu gije boldy.
This is a great job.	Bu ajaýyp iş.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
I knew it wasn't there.	Munuň ýokdugyny bilýärdim.
The girl was right.	Gyz dogry aýtdy.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
He does a lot of things.	Köp zatlar edýär.
You can do this in a number of ways.	Muny birnäçe ýol bilen edip bilersiňiz.
He never did that.	Ol muny hiç haçan etmedi.
She is still well.	Ol henizem gowy galdy.
I want to help her.	Men oňa kömek etmek isleýärin.
Nothing can happen.	Hiç zat bolup bilmez.
I do not have.	Mende däl.
That should not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däldi.
Just for himself.	Diňe özi üçin.
They just don’t exist.	Olar diňe ýok.

You have to stop it.	Ony bes etmeli.
So we have.	Şonuň üçin biz bar.
So you have to get the job done.	Şonuň üçin bu işi almaly.
This is for the future.	Bu geljek üçin.
He took me.	Ol meni aldy.
This can never happen.	Bu hiç zat bolup bilmez.
Not so.	Şeýle hem däl.
This is definitely true.	Bu hökman dogry.
I would suggest this again.	Muny ýene bir gezek teklip ederin.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Erbet zat ýokdy.
It won't be long.	Kän bolmaz.
I had nothing.	Mende hiç zat ýokdy.
There is a lot.	Köp zat bar.
It was a wonderful night.	Bu ajaýyp gije boldy.
He didn't have to give it to her anymore.	Oňa indi bermeli däldi.
Not necessarily.	Hökman däl.
The man would be fine.	Adam gowy bolardy.
That's right- they are.	Dogry, olar.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
Therefore.	Şonuň üçin.
We can't go to the police.	Polisiýa baryp bilmeris.
Definitely a good thing.	Elbetde gowy zat.

Too many lies.	Gaty köp ýalan.
Why would that be?	Näme üçin beýle bolar?
You are here	Sen şu ýerde
Whatever next.	Indiki näme bolsa.
You can be yourself.	Özüňiz bolup bilersiňiz.
There were two issues.	Iki mesele bardy.

This is a great idea.	Bu uly pikir.
Not a bad thing.	Erbet zat däl.
It seems very difficult, but not impossible.	Gaty kyn ýaly görünýär, ýöne mümkin däl.

Too many people.	Adam gaty köp.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.

That's right.	Bu dogry.
Not long.	Uzak däl.

This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
There were too many answers.	Jogap gaty köp boldy.
I'm not worried yet.	Men henizem biynjalyk däl.

Now to vote.	Indi ses bermek üçin.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
So it was fun.	Şonuň üçin gyzykly boldy.
I think this is a really good thing for us.	Bu biziň üçin hakykatdanam gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
He did not want to do that again.	Ol mundan beýläk beýle etmek islemedi.
He knows nothing.	Ol hiç zady bilmeýär.
Another way.	Başga bir ýol.
I didn't want to be like that.	Men beýle bolmak islemedim.
So it was really good for us.	Şonuň üçin bu hakykatdanam biziň üçin gowy boldy.
In fact, it was.	Aslynda ol şeýle boldy.
Of course you have to do that.	Elbetde şeýle etmeli.
What is this 	Bu näme?
It can't be.	Bolup bilmez.
Here	Bu ýere.
Life doesn't have to be this way.	Durmuş munuň ýaly zatlary etmeli däl.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
We must.	Biz hökman etmeli.
They both have to be there.	Ikisi-de şol ýerde bolmaly.

He can't see you today.	Ol bu gün seni görüp bilmeýär.
This was not the case at all.	Bu asla beýle däldi.
He does better and better.	Ol has gowy we has gowy edýär.
I'll be there	Men şol ýerde bolaryn
It looks very bad right now.	Häzirki wagtda gaty erbet görünýär.
Worst idea.	Iň erbet pikir.
I knew nothing about it.	Men bu barada hiç zat bilmeýärdim.
So tell us the truth.	Şonuň üçin bize hakykaty aýdyň.
At the moment you have nothing.	Häzirki wagtda size hiç zat ýok.
I thought it would be better.	Men has gowy bolar öýdüpdim.
A long time ago.	Köp wagt öň.
Just one night	Diňe bir gije.

Here is the good news.	Ine, gowy habar.
I had never thought of that before.	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim.
Not tomorrow, not next week, today.	Ertir däl, indiki hepde däl, şu gün.
It won't happen anymore.	Indi bolmaz.
Someone has to pay attention.	Kimdir biri üns bermeli.
A few hours left.	Birnäçe sagat galdy.
If there is a problem, we are.	Mesele bar bolsa, biz.
Not my thing.	Meniň zadym däl.
There is no right person.	Dogry adam ýok.
Now there was always something.	Indi elmydama bir zat bardy.

He will help me.	Ol maňa kömek eder.

You can do everything right and still be.	Hemme zady dogry edip bilersiňiz we henizem bolýar.
Not enough for just one person.	Diňe ýeterlik adam üçin ýeterlik däl.
There is no good reason for that.	Munuň üçin gowy sebäp ýok.
There was nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.
It took months to do.	Etmek üçin birnäçe aý gerek boldy.
You can do the same.	Muny hem edip bilersiňiz.
He knew nothing about us.	Ol biz hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdi.
I saw it yesterday.	Men ony düýn gördüm.
It was nothing.	Bu hiç zat däldi.
This seems to have already happened.	Bu eýýäm bolup geçen ýaly.

It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.

This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.

With another person.	Başga bir adam bilen.
He wanted to know.	Ol bilmek isledi.
This, of course, was not the case.	Bu, elbetde, dogry däldi.
He had to go.	Ol gitmeli boldy.
It's good to be together.	Bile bolmak gowy zat.
Something bad.	Biraz erbet zat.
I care about him a lot.	Men oňa köp alada edýärin.
Sorry, that's not the case.	Bagyşlaň, beýle däl.
Good sound.	Gowy ses.
He thinks this is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýär.
Really long time.	Hakykatdanam uzak wagt.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Belki ertir gije.
It should not be difficult to be with them.	Olar bilen bolmak kyn bolmaly däl.
It must be.	Bu hökman bolmaly.
How	Nädip
There was always something to do.	Elmydama etmeli bir zady bardy.
I doubt that.	Men muňa şübhelenýärin.
This is not a bad thing.	Bu erbet mesele däl.
I knew it all.	Men muny doly bilýärdim.
Not many people know that.	Köp adam muny bilmeýär.
He said this himself.	Muny özi aýtdy.
He immediately offered.	Ol derrew teklip etdi.
Everyone knew that.	Muny hemmeler bilýärdi.
It may be possible, but it is not.	Mümkin bolup biler, ýöne bu mümkin däl.
In fact, he did not say a word.	Aslynda hiç söz aýtmady.
I never thought he could take it all.	Hemmesini alyp biljekdigini hiç wagt pikir etmedim.
I'm scared.	Men däli gorkýaryn.
That's it.	Ine, şeýle.
It wasn’t me, but it was almost.	Bu men däldi, ýöne diýen ýalydy.
Maybe it's good.	Belki, ol gowy.
It turned out very easily.	Bu gaty aňsat çykdy.
And then things get interesting.	Soň bolsa zatlar gyzykly bolýar.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
At most two.	Iň köp ikisi.
I think so.	Men şeýle pikir edýärin.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Ony çalt etmelidigini bilýärdi.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
There are two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar.
I just didn't need a book.	Maňa diňe kitap gerek däldi.
This made him anxious.	Bu ony biynjalyk etdi.
This is a very bad thing.	Bu gaty erbet zat.
I'm so scared.	Men şeýle gorkýaryn, diýen ýaly.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
This is me now.	Bu indi men.
This is not very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn däl.
He understood that.	Ol muňa düşündi.
He went crazy.	Ol däli bolup gitdi.
We can say a lot.	Köp zady aýdyp bileris.
He did not inform her.	Ol oňa habar bermedi.
I was so bad.	Men gaty erbet boldum.
It sounds crazy, but it's not.	Bu däli ýaly görünýär, ýöne beýle däl.
Not much.	Kän däl.
This is very agreeable now.	Bu indi gaty razy.
Only good things can happen.	Diňe gowy zat bolup biler.
Somewhere, we need it.	Ol bir ýerde, bize mätäç.
Once upon a time.	Bir gezek.
Not you, not them.	Sen däl, olar däl.
I almost did.	Men diýen ýaly etdim.
It exists today.	Ol häzirki wagtda bar.
Couldn't get enough noise.	Gaty ses alyp bilmedi.
This is not difficult.	Bu kyn däl.
I didn't really think about it.	Men bu hakda hakykatdanam pikir etmedim.
He took her away.	Ony alyp gitdi.
She thought she was not beautiful.	Ol owadan däl diýip pikir etdi.
I doubt that.	Men muňa şübhelenýärin.
This is still a great way.	Bu henizem ajaýyp ýol.
I hope it never happens again.	Mundan beýläk hiç haçan hökman bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Başga köp zatlar bilen edip bilersiňiz.
That, of course, happened to me.	Bu, elbetde, meniň üçin boldy.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
Who we are	Biz kim
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ol ýerde hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
This is not clear.	Bu aýdyň däl.
I can't sleep alone	Men ýeke uklap bilemok
It happened to him.	Bu oňa boldy.
I know he will.	Etjekdigini bilýärin.
Maybe not.	Belki beýle däl.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
A lot has happened.	Köp zat boldy.
Then he had to leave.	Soň bolsa gitmeli boldy.
That's all there was to it.	Diňe şu bardy.
He said.	Ol şeýle diýdi.
This is good news and bad news.	Bu hem gowy habar, hem erbet habar.
In fact, it was not.	Aslynda beýle däldi.
This thing was everywhere.	Bu zat hemme ýerde bardy.
This seems to be true.	Bu dogry bolup görünýär.
We can go back tomorrow evening.	Ertir agşam gaýdyp bileris.
This is another day.	Bu başga bir gün.
It's worse tonight.	Bu gije has erbet.
They are smarter.	Olar has akylly.
They really did exist.	Hakykatdanam olar bardy.
I only have a few quick questions.	Mende diňe birnäçe çalt sorag bar.
There are good things.	Gowy zatlary bar.
No one is going to do that for you.	Hiç kim seniň üçin muny etjek däl.
You can't just go	Diňe gidip bolmaz
It was not good.	Gowy däldi.
We have to go.	Biz gitmeli.
Last message.	Iň soňky habar.
We can do nothing.	Biz hiç zat edip bilmeris.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
He was really there.	Ol ýerde hakykatdanam bardy.

That was a good thing.	Munuň özi gowy boldy.
Here is the answer now.	Ine, häzir jogap.
It's like crazy.	Bu däli ýaly.
Quick.	Çalt.
This is life.	Bu durmuş.
I want to be right.	Dogry etmek isleýärin.
I just didn't think that would happen.	Diňe beýle bolar öýdemokdym.
Oh how good.	Aý nähili gowy.
There is definitely a problem with what happens.	Bolýan zatlar bilen hökman bir mesele bar.
He will never know.	Ol hiç haçan bilmez.
Of course he couldn't.	Elbetde, edip bilmedi.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda bu şeýle.
It tells me one of two things.	Bu maňa iki zadyň birini aýdýar.
He does this in a number of ways.	Muny birnäçe ýol bilen edýär.
Bad thing, he didn't need it anymore.	Erbet, oňa indi gerek däldi.
Not much here.	Bu ýerde kän däl.
In fact, it is not far away.	Aslynda gaty uzak däl.
A few people asked me about it.	Bu hakda menden birnäçe adam sorady.
He can see that.	Ol muny görüp bilýär.
It will be beautiful.	Bu owadan zat bolar.
Of course, this is me.	Elbetde, bu men.
There was a good reason for that.	Munuň gowy sebäbi bardy.
It's been a day.	Bir gün boldy.
I don't do that anymore.	Indi beýle etmeýärin.
Just a word.	Diňe söz.
What a wonderful meal.	Nähili ajaýyp nahar.
This is good and bad.	Bu gowy we erbet.
I know.	Men bilýärin.
Not such a good idea anymore.	Indi beýle gowy pikir däl.
Worry, worry, worry.	Alada, alada, alada.

It's good to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy zat.
This is not short.	Bu gysga däl.
I didn't help.	Men kömek etmedim.
You don't have to know anything else.	Başga bir zady bilmek hökman däl.
Tomorrow will be a better day.	Ertir, has gowy gün bolar.
Of course, you are busy.	Elbetde, sen meşgul.
He didn't either.	Ol hem etmedi.

It also looks beautiful.	Şeýle hem owadan görünýär.
I always care about everything and I care about it.	Hemişe hemme zat hakda alada edýärin we alada edýärin.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
What a day	Bu nähili gün.
He said he had.	Ol bardygyny aýtdy.
Now the sun is nowhere to be found.	Indi gün, asla hiç ýerde ýok.
No fun here.	Bu ýerde hezil ýok.
All I need is you	Maňa diňe gerek
What happened.	Näme boldy.
Maybe another time.	Belki başga bir gezek.
This is it.	Bu bolsa.
That would be nice.	Bu gowy bolardy.

Book, book, book.	Kitap, kitap, kitap.
There seems to be a problem.	Mesele bar ýaly.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
You should never do that.	Muny hiç haçan etmeli däl.
Many words	Köp söz.
I have so much fun!	Men gaty hezil!
He knew in that look that he had succeeded.	Ol hiç kimiň etmejekdigini bilýärdi.
She was worried.	Ol alada galdy.
To be smart.	Akylly bolmak.
It didn't do anything good.	Bu hiç hili gowy zat etmedi.

You're not even there	Sen hatda ol ýerde däl
What did he say?	Ol näme diýdi?

Maybe something can be done in the near future.	Belki ýakyn wagtda bir zat edip bolar.
You are either with us or with them.	Siz ýa-da biziň bilen, ýa-da olar bilen.
I did nothing else.	Mundan başga hiç zat etmedim.
Only me	Diňe men.
No one should, but someone should.	Hiç kim etmeli däl, ýöne kimdir biri etmeli.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
It's easy to say.	Aýtmak aňsat.
Maybe one day.	Belki bir gün.
He doesn't like it.	Ol muny halamaýar.
I had so much fun all week.	Bütin hepde gaty hezil etdim.
There will be no one else.	Başga biri bolmaz.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu şeýle bolmaly.
Something is going on there.	Ol ýerde bir zat bolýar.
You are so beautiful	Sen gaty owadan
This will be the case.	Bu şeýle bolar.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle etmedi.
He took one and two.	Bir we iki aldy.
It's been a short day.	Gysga bir gün boldy.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Men ol hakda mundan beýläk gürleşmek islämok.
So here it is.	Şonuň üçin şu ýerde.
This is also not true.	Bu hem dogry däl.
Of course, it can be very good.	Elbetde, gaty gowy bolup biler.
Why not? 	Näme üçin beýle däl?

Actually two lives.	Aslynda iki durmuş.
She is very smart.	Ol gaty akylly.
I think this is great.	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir edýärin.
He cares about that.	Bu alada barada alada edýär.
We are really bad.	Biz hakykatdanam erbet.
These are wonderful things.	Bu ajaýyp zatlar.
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
This is really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty kyn.
This is not a good idea.	Bu gowy üns däl.
I don't like it	Men ony halamok
Maybe a year.	Belki bir ýyl.
I'm new to this job.	Men bu iş üçin täze.
Bad, very bad.	Erbet, gaty erbet.
This was not even possible.	Bu hatda mümkin däldi.
That's the way it is at home.	Öýde şeýle.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu dogry däl.
I immediately rejoice and fear.	Men derrew begenýärin we gorkýaryn.
So weird!	Gaty geň!
There is nothing here.	Bu ýerde bar ýok.
This is a very bad idea.	Bu gaty erbet pikir.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
Just like now	Edil häzirki ýaly.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
You know that.	Muny bilýärsiň.
Maybe I don't think it's time.	Belki, munuň wagty geldi öýdemok.
The day before yesterday.	Düýn bir gün öň.
I immediately decided that this was a guy for me.	Bu meniň üçin ýigit diýip derrew karar berdim.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa rugsat bermedi.
By being something.	Bir zat bolmak bilen.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýok.
We can't help you anymore.	Indi size kömek edip bilmeris.
And then he says.	Soň bolsa aýdýar.
You are bad	Sen erbet
And he says good things about you.	We sen hakda gowy zatlar aýdýar.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He knows this can happen.	Munuň şeýle bolup biljekdigini bilýär.
And for good reason.	We gowy sebäp bilen.
There was definitely nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde hökman bir zat dogry däldi.
Of course about money.	Elbetde pul hakda.
He was there for himself.	Ol özi üçin bardy.
This is not really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy däl.
There are a few other things like this.	Munuň ýaly ýene birnäçe zat bar.
I have to stop this.	Men muny bes etmeli.
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
There was no time.	Wagty ýokdy.
Now everything is fine.	Indi hemme zat gowy boldy.
That seems reasonable.	Bu ýeterlik görünýär.
We are right now.	Biz häzir şeýle.
He wanted to ask a question.	Bir sorag bermek isledi.
Nor will it be good alone.	Şeýle hem, ýeke özi gowy bolmaz.
It is impossible to do the right thing.	Dogry bir zat etmek mümkin däl.
Not yet, he said.	Entek däl, özi aýtdy.
What to do?	Näme etmeli?
He will not object to that at all.	Ol muňa asla garşy bolmaz.
In fact, this is often the case.	Hakykatdanam, köplenç şeýle bolýar.
Too bad.	Gaty erbet.
I think so.	Men munuň ýaly pikir edýärin.
That's a lot of money, no question.	Bu gaty köp pul, sorag ýok.
He is a really good man.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy adam.
That man did.	Ol adam şeýle etdi.
I don't need it anymore.	Maňa indi gerek däl.
He had to go to work.	Ol işe gitmeli boldy.
It should be great, but it is not.	Ajaýyp bolmaly, ýöne beýle däl.
You are here again.	Siz ýene şu ýerde.
You don’t have to offer much here.	Bu ýerde kän teklip bermeli däl.
This is not true of me.	Bu men hakda dogry däl.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
Just a few answers.	Diňe birnäçe jogap.
It did.	Bu etdi.
Me.	Ine.
I'm sure it will.	Boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
And then there is nothing.	Soň bolsa asla hiç zat ýok.
I am a bad person	Men erbet adam
And then.	Soň bolsa.
This is often the case.	Bu köplenç şeýle bolýar.
This is not always true.	Bu söz hemişe dogry däl.
It wasn't very interesting.	Kän gyzykly däldi.
This is great too.	Bu hem ajaýyp.
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
We need a lot like you.	Bize seniň ýaly köp zat gerek.
That's what it does.	Ine, şeýle edýär.
They don't need us.	Olar bize mätäç däl.
Very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly.
There is plenty of time to go.	Gitmek üçin köp wagty bar.
Then he started talking.	Soň bolsa gürläp başlady.
Do what is necessary to make you happy.	Seni bagtly etmek üçin zerur zatlary et.
It just couldn’t happen.	Diňe bolup bilmedi.
I think you're a good person.	Meniň pikirimçe sen gowy adam.
This is not surprising to me.	Bu meniň üçin geň däl.
It's been a while.	Ol ýerde birnäçe wagt boldy.

He did a great job.	Ol gaty gowy iş etdi.
I think that's enough.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýeterlik.
He forgot.	Ol ýatdan çykdy.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
He wanted to help her, but she wouldn't let him.	Oňa kömek etmek isledi, ýöne oňa rugsat bermedi.
It was a good working day.	Bu gowy iş güni boldy.
Always new.	Elmydama täze.
This makes me really crazy.	Bu meni hakykatdanam däli edýär.
He said it would probably be this week.	Ol, belki, şu hepde boljakdygyny aýtdy.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
In fact, the opposite is true.	Aslynda düýbünden garşy.
Sorry, this is not the case.	Bagyşlaň, bu beýle däl.
For next things	Indiki zatlar üçin
I had to decide.	Men karar bermeli boldum.
Then you can do whatever you need.	Şol wagt näme gerek bolsa, edip bilersiňiz.
Here's what's going on right now.	Ine, şu wagt näme bolýar.
Two young girls.	Iki ýaş gyz.
He really did exist.	Ol hakykatdanam bardy.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
There is something about money.	Pul hakda bir zat bar.
Really	Hakykatdanam.
You are yourself	Siz özüňiz
There was no one.	Hiç kim ýokdy.
I don't even know why.	Näme üçin hatda bardygyny bilemok.
It's too fast for that.	Munuň üçin gaty çalt.
Best hope for the future.	Geljek üçin iň gowy umyt.
They are one and two.	Olar bir we iki.
I promised.	Men söz berdim.
This is difficult for him.	Bu onuň üçin kyn.
I wonder if this could happen fast.	Munuň çalt bolup biljekdigine haýran.
I think so and I hope so.	Şeýle pikir edýärin we umyt edýärin.
There was nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.
He will do it.	Muny eder.
I thought about everything.	Men hemme zat hakda pikir etdim.
He is the only one who can say.	Ol aýdyp biljek ýeke-täk adam.
Not enough time.	Wagt ýeterlik däldi.
There was a problem.	Mesele bardy.
Worse things will come.	Has erbet zatlar geler.
I think it will never happen.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hiç haçan bolmaz.
You have to go now	Indi gitmeli
Not easy, of course, but bad.	Elbetde aňsat däl, ýöne erbet däl.
This work is very interesting.	Bu iş gaty gyzykly edýär.
No decision yet.	Indi karar ýok.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Nothing can happen.	Hiç zat bolup bilmez.
She thought it was very beautiful.	Ol gaty owadan diýip pikir etdi.
It has always been good for me.	Bu meniň üçin elmydama gowy boldy.
Something to help.	Kömek etjek zat.
The work is good.	Iş gowy.
It was also new.	Bu hem täze boldy.
No one knows.	Bu barada hiç kim bilenok.
No more debt.	Indi karz ýok.
He came to help.	Ol kömek etmek üçin geldi.
About time.	Wagt hakda.
I do the same.	Men edil şol bir zady edýärin.
It always has been and always will be.	Elmydama bardy we hemişe bolar.
I can't be mad at anyone.	Men hiç kime däli bolup bilemok.
Shortcut.	Gysga ýol.
He didn't tell me how he knew.	Ol maňa nädip bilýändigini aýtmady.
It's summer.	Tomus güni boldy.
Whatever you need.	Näme gerek bolsa.
That sounds really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp ýaly.
Tomorrow, even.	Ertir, hatda.
It's been two nights.	Bu iki gije boldy.
Then he fell asleep.	Soň bolsa uklap galdy.
This is a big deal.	Bu uly mesele.
He can't do that to me.	Ol muny maňa edip bilmeýär.
This may still be the case.	Bu henizem bolup biler.
This will really help us.	Bu hakykatdanam bize kömek eder.
This song should be.	Bu aýdym bolmaly.
They are not alone.	Olar ýeke-täk däl.
I really want to do more.	Men hakykatdanam köp zatlar etmek isleýärin.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
He is back with us now.	Ol indi biziň bilen gaýdyp geldi.
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
You can go now	Indi gidip bilersiňiz
No more for me.	Indi meniň üçin ýok.
I think more will come.	Meniň pikirimçe has köp zat geler.
A few things.	Birnäçe zat.
It's okay to go now.	Häzir gitmek dogry.
He wanted it.	Ol muny isledi.
He gave it to her.	Ol oňa berdi.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde asla ýalňyşlyk ýokdy.
It was still new.	Ol henizem täze boldy.
Everything is there now.	Häzir bar zat.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
There is so much to do.	Bu ýerde gaty köp zat bar.
I question everything.	Men hemme zady sorag edýärin.
You can tell	Aýdyp bilersiňiz.
He was not crazy, no.	Ol däli däldi, ýok.
He lives here.	Ol şu ýerde ýaşaýar.
I will not always be there.	Men hemişe ol ýerde bolmaz.
He could sing.	Ol aýdym aýdyp bilýärdi.
Not for a lot of money.	Köp pul üçin däl.
I have to tell you about it.	Men bu hakda size aýtmaly.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Great man	Ajaýyp adam.
I don't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmeýärin.
It's there, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Ol ýerde "diýdi.
Of course we can't.	Elbetde edip bilmeris.
There is no one here yet.	Bu ýerde entek hiç kim ýok.
This is just a word.	Bu diňe bir söz.
You have to be happy and have a rest.	Bagtly bolmaly we dynç almaly.
He may be right.	Dogry aýdyp biler.
It turned out well.	Gowy çykdy.
This is serious.	Bu çynlakaý bolýar.
I think it could be better then.	Şeýle bolsa has gowy bolup biler diýip pikir edýärin.
Seeing something else.	Başga bir zady görmek.
Everyone got it.	Hemmeler aldy.
He had to do it himself.	Muny özi etmeli boldy.
No one could see.	Hiç kim görüp bilmedi.
This is a really good idea.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy pikir.
He is the same as before.	Ol öňküsi ýaly.
Okay.	Bolýar.
This is easy money.	Bu aňsat pul.
Not much.	Kän däl.
That's the way life is.	Durmuş şeýle.
It can be the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly bolup biler.
I couldn't sleep again.	Men ýene uklap bilmedim.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
No one else could do that.	Muny başga hiç kim edip bilmedi.
Never far away	Hiç wagt uzak däl.
It could be.	Ol bolup biler.
He did it at the same time.	Ol muny bir wagtda etdi.
A few days ago.	Birnäçe gün ozal.
This is another.	Bu başga biri.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
There are two possibilities here.	Bu ýerde iki mümkinçilik bar.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
I will never, ever will.	Mende hiç haçan bolmaz, bolmaz.
I did this and other things.	Men muny we başga zatlary etdim.
He said tonight.	Ol şu gije gije diýdi.
The advice is completely different.	Maslahat düýbünden başga zat.
This was not what he wanted to do.	Bu onuň etmek isleýän işi däldi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
And then he did something wonderful and wonderful.	Soň bolsa ajaýyp we ajaýyp bir zat etdi.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle däl.
It was not good.	Gowy däldi.
He was probably surprised.	Ol, belki, geň galdy.
Many people will agree.	Köp adam razy bolar.
He decided.	Ol karar berdi.
Impossible, but something will happen.	Mümkin däl, ýöne bir zat bolar.
Just having fun.	Diňe hezil etmek.
Of course not.	Elbetde, hökman däl.
Not for us.	Biz üçin däl.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
I almost got the right answer.	Dogry jogap aldym diýen ýaly.
I confessed.	Men boýun aldym.
Always here to help us.	Bize kömek etmek üçin elmydama şu ýerde.
He doesn't do that often.	Ol muny köplenç etmeýär.
We can't agree with that.	Biz muňa razy bolup bilmeris.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Bu hakykatdanam çynlakaý bolmaly.
I can't get it.	Ony alyp bilemok.
We can only go so fast.	Biz diňe şeýle çalt gidip bileris.
I think that’s a lot of work.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty köp iş.
You have to do it yourself.	Muny özüňiz etmeli.
Just a short thought.	Diňe gysga bir pikir.
This may be the case.	Munuň şeýle bolmagy mümkin.
No one called to find out what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny bilmek üçin hiç kim jaň etmedi.
He thought it was a very bad mistake.	Ol gaty erbet ýalňyşlyk diýip pikir etdi.
This is happening everywhere.	Bu hemme ýerde bolýar.
Nothing can be done about it.	Bu hakda hiç zat edip bolmaz.
It may be easy to be surprised.	Onuň geň galmagy aňsat bolup biler.
I heard about it.	Men bu hakda eşitdim.
He thought it wasn't much.	Ol kän däl diýip pikir etdi.
I never saw him.	Ony hiç kim bilen görmedim.
I do not fully believe this.	Men muňa doly ynanamok.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
Hard and hard.	Gaty we gaty.
He will not be there to help her.	Oňa kömek etmek üçin ol ýerde bolmaz.
I will do everything.	Men her zat ederin.
Not good for himself.	Özüne gowy däl.
Then there is the time.	Soň bolsa wagt bar.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Of course, this is not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däl.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
Of course, this is not true at all.	Elbetde, bu asla dogry däl.
I already said.	Men eýýäm aýtdym.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
It's too short to say.	Muny aýtmak gaty gysga.
Needless to say, it happened.	Bolandygyny aýtmak hökman däl.
I always want something impossible.	Elmydama mümkin däl zady isleýärin.
No one was on the ground.	Hiç kim ýerde däldi.
It's not like that.	Munuň ýaly zat däl.
He arrived this morning.	Şu gün irden geldi.
There are actually two issues here.	Aslynda bu ýerde iki mesele bar.
I want to.	Men isleýärin.
There was something else.	Başga bir zat hem bardy.
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
In fact many times.	Aslynda köp gezek.
This is another.	Bu başga bir.
This word is probably.	Bu söz, ähtimal.
This idea is not new at all.	Bu pikir düýbünden täze däl.
And then he came back.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp geldi.
The problem is the same.	Mesele şol bir.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
You should never do that.	Asla beýle etmeli däl.
He is not.	Ol ýok.
I hope for the future.	Geljek hakda umyt edýärin.
I could not see how it could be so serious.	Nädip çynlakaý bolup biljekdigini görüp bilmedim.
I am a happy person.	Men bagtly adam.
He knew this very well.	Ol muny gaty gowy bilýärdi.
This time it happened.	Bu gezek şeýle boldy.
Someone knows something.	Kimdir biri bir zady bilýär.
There is a man.	Bir adam bar.
Really full	Hakykatdanam doly
There was a young man.	Bir ýigit bardy.
Nothing is more than that.	Hiç zat diňe özi däl.
That should not be the case.	Bu aýdyň bolmaly däl.
He thought he knew.	Ol bilýärdi, diýip pikir etdi.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Diňe gaty köp zat bar.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
It could happen again tonight.	Bu gije ýene bolup biler.
They are still together.	Olar henizem bile.
Something happened to me.	Maňa bir zat boldy.
It wasn't his job, he wanted to tell her.	Bu onuň işi däldi, oňa aýtmak isledi.
He said it was not good.	Ol munuň gowy däldigini aýtdy.
I'll take care of you.	Men seniň üçin alada ederin.
He couldn't be serious.	Ol çynlakaý bolup bilmedi.
Very good now.	Indi gaty gowy.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle bolmaz.
Many people.	Köp adam.
It was impossible to say right now.	Häzir aýtmak mümkin däldi.
He objected.	Garşy çykdy.
I need help.	Maňa kömek etmeli.
Maybe he'll come back next summer, maybe he won't.	Belki indiki tomus gaýdyp geler, belki bolmaz.
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
He decided to go home early.	Öýüne ir gitmek kararyna geldi.
In fact, there is no other way.	Aslynda başga ýol ýok.
This is work.	Bu iş.
The case called me.	Iş maňa jaň etdi.
This is exactly what happened.	Bu hakykatdanam nähili boldy.
It's kind of interesting.	Bu bir hili gyzykly.
You are crazy, man.	Sen däli, adam.
Right here.	Edil şu ýerde.
I'm fine.	Men gowy.
This is a challenge for us.	Bu bolsa biziň üçin kynçylyk.
Probably.	Mümkin.
Maybe he told me that.	Belki, ol muny maňa aýtdy.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
Nothing more was needed.	Mundan başga hiç zat gerek däldi.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
It would be easier to do that.	Şeýle etmek has aňsat bolardy.
Of course, he was not.	Elbetde, onuň özi ýokdy.
A week ago I went crazy for him, now nothing.	Bir hepde öň onuň üçin däli boldum, indi hiç zat.
Good job!	Gowy iş!
He didn't do that anymore.	Indi beýle etmedi.
One night	Bir gije.
This is not true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry däl.
Of course, I didn't want to.	Elbetde, islemedim.
He can't speak.	Ol gürläp bilmeýär.
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
He was not young.	Ol ýaş däldi.
He is everything to me.	Ol meniň hemme zadym.

Of course.	Elbetde.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
Appears a year ago.	Bir ýyl mundan ozal görünýär.

Also, no.	Şeýle hem, ýok.
Everyone has something to do.	Her kimiň etmeli işi bar.
In your opinion.	Siziň pikiriňizçe.

This is a stupid idea.	Bu samsyk pikir.
He apologized again.	Ol ýene ötünç sorady.

A little happy.	Biraz bagtly.
Something like this happened.	Munuň ýaly zatlar boldy.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu dogry däl ýaly.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
You have to answer that.	Muňa jogap bermeli.
Oh, so short.	Aý, gaty gysga.
I actually didn’t see anything.	Aslynda hiç zat görmedim.
Not everything is the same.	Hemme zat beýle däl.
Working hours.	Iş wagty.
He responded immediately.	Ol derrew jogap berdi.
Of course, they were not the only ones.	Elbetde, diňe olar däldi.
The sun is gone.	Gün gitdi.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
It would be great to be right.	Dogry bolmak gaty gowy bolardy.
Of course this will be true.	Elbetde bu dogry bolar.
I can't call either.	Men hem jaň edip bilemok.
He can't do that.	Ol muny edip bilmez.
In fact, you could say that.	Aslynda muny aýdyp bilersiňiz.
The problem is here.	Mesele şu ýerde.
He just can't do it.	Ol diňe edip bilmeýär.
I have to tell you one last thing.	Size soňky bir zady aýtmaly.
This is not the worst thing.	Bu iň erbet zat däl.
They were not.	Olar beýle däldi.
He could tell.	Ol aýdyp bilýärdi.
We need another person.	Bize ýene bir adam gerek.
This is a great help.	Bu uly kömek.
Someone had to lend.	Kimdir biri karz bermeli boldy.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
There is a lot going on.	Köp zat gelýär.
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
I don't have to tell you anything else.	Saňa başga zat aýtmaly däl.
Everything about them is different.	Olar hakda hemme zat başga.
He thought it was now.	Ol indi boldy diýip pikir etdi.
Of course, this is great.	Elbetde, bu gaty gowy.
It was not a good night.	Bu gowy gije däldi.
This book is just new.	Bu kitap edil täze.
Only.	Diňe.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
He asked me what he did for a living.	Ol menden durmuş üçin näme edendigini sorady.
About life.	Durmuş hakda.
He was like a man.	Adam ýalydy.
He will do the right thing.	Dogry eder.
Just then the Moon came out.	Edil şol wagt Aý çykdy.
This is not good at all.	Bu asla gowy däl.
Now he is being helped by two other people.	Indi oňa başga iki adam kömek edýär.
Maybe he'll do something himself.	Belki, özi bir zat eder.
I'm busy now.	Men häzir meşgul boldum.
You have to go	Sen gitmeli
Oh, not in many words.	Aý, köp söz bilen däl.
This did not happen.	Bu bolup bilmedi.
He doesn't need it.	Oňa mätäç däl.
Then he came out again.	Soň bolsa ýene çykdy.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, diňe isleýän zadyny edýär.
I want to be there to see him.	Men ony görmek üçin şol ýerde bolmak isleýärin.
I really do.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle edýärin.
Not always the right answer.	Elmydama dogry jogap däl.
This is a difficult question.	Bu kyn sorag.
That can't be good.	Bu gowy bolup bilmez.
This is what happens.	Bu şeýle bolýar.
I didn't see him.	Men onuň bilen görmedim.
Nothing this time.	Bu gezek hiç zat.
He could not.	Ol edip bilmedi.
You don't have to be beautiful.	Owadan bolmak hökman däl.
This is worse.	Bu has erbet.
Okay, that's not true at all.	Bolýar, bu asla dogry däl.
He always knew what he was thinking.	Elmydama onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilýärdi.
It told me something.	Bu maňa bir zat aýtdy.
Just like a guy.	Edil ýigit ýaly.
Good.	Gowy.
I couldn't be that way.	Men beýle bolup bilmedim.
He will perish.	Ol ýok bolar.
It was easy for me to get it.	Muny almak maňa aňsat boldy.
It gets a little difficult.	Biraz kyn bolýar.
There is a lot of damage.	Zyýan köp.
Whoever did this took it away.	Kim muny eden bolsa, ony alyp gitdi.
I still think that's right.	Men henizem dogry diýip pikir edýärin.
Why is it still here?	Näme üçin henizem şu ýerde?
I've seen it twice.	Men ony iki gezek gördüm.
Who knows what.	Näme, kim bilýär.
It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
Like everyone else.	Hemmeler ýaly.
More, even.	Has köp, hatda.
I am just me.	Men diňe men.
Now it was just fun.	Indi diňe lezzet bardy.
She looked very young.	Ol gaty ýaş ýalydy.
Hopefully, right?	Umyt edip bolar, şeýlemi?
The police are coming.	Polisiýa gelýär.
He was worried all night.	Ol bütin gije alada galdy.
I do a really good job.	Men hakykatdanam gaty gowy iş edýärin.
There was absolutely nothing there.	Ol ýerde düýbünden hiç zat ýokdy.
I am a very good guy.	Men gaty gowy ýigit.
This is a good and bad thing.	Bu gowy we erbet zat.
Of course, he is crazy.	Elbetde, ol däli.
Sorry, I can't help you there.	Bagyşlaň, ol ýerde size kömek edip bilemok.
Such a great tip.	Şeýle ajaýyp maslahat.
Nor will it be the last.	Şeýle hem ol iň soňky bolmaz.
There are several such.	Şeýle birnäçe bar.
I'm not crazy about him.	Men oňa däli däl.
I don't know anything else.	Mundan başga hiç zat bilemok.
It's really fun to do that.	Muny etmek hakykatdanam gyzykly.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
Maybe it helped?	Belki kömek etdi?
He gave a little.	Biraz berdi.
I paid attention to him.	Men oňa üns berdim.
It was like an impossible task.	Bu mümkin däl iş ýalydy.
Not always true for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin hemişe dogry däl.
who doesn't know	kim bilmez.
It will work for you.	Iş saňa eder.
I never did anything else.	Hiç haçan başga iş görmedim.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
It took a while.	Biraz wagt aldy.
It's been a good year!	Gowy ýyl boldy!
Probably for you.	Mümkin, siziň üçin.
There was so much going on here.	Bu ýerde gaty köp zat boldy.
I can't find a way.	Men bir ýol görüp bilemok.
That wasn't a big deal.	Bu gaty ýalan däldi.
I doubt this will happen.	Munuň boljakdygyna şübhelenýärin.
I'm not young	Men bu ýaş däl
He did what he was supposed to do.	Etjek zadyny etdi.
Of course, this is too big for one person.	Elbetde, bu bir adam üçin gaty uly.
At that time, now.	Şol wagt, indi.
Of course, this is a bad way.	Elbetde, bu bir erbet ýol.
There are two issues here.	Bu ýerde iki mesele bar.
Except for me.	Elbetde, menden başga.
You can only get one or two calls.	Diňe bir ýa-da iki jaň alyp bilersiňiz.
Here is the guy.	Bu ýerde ýigit.
Because they are so new.	Sebäbi olar gaty täze.
There is only one good reason for this.	Munuň diňe bir gowy sebäbi bar.
I need one here.	Maňa şu ýerde biri gerek.
A year ago.	Bir ýyl mundan ozal.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şeýle boldy, gitdi.
This cannot be done everywhere.	Muny hemme ýerde edip bolmaz.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, häzirki wagtda şeýle görünýär.
I was busy.	Men meşgul boldum.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I couldn't care less.	Alada edip bilmedim.
This is stupid.	Bu samsyk.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
You have to do better.	Mundan has gowy etmeli.
It was like two years ago.	Iki ýyl mundan ozal ýalydy.
Oh, oh, do something.	Aý, aý, bir zatlar et.
He must have seen me before.	Meni öň gören bolmaly.
Needless to say.	Indi aýtmaly däl.
I can do it again this year.	Bu ýyl ýene edip bilerin.
It was not what made him bad.	Ony erbet eden zat däldi.
The job is better now.	Iş indi has gowy.
Because it's me, it's just me.	Sebäbi bu men, diňe men.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
Maybe he didn't have time.	Belki, onuň wagty ýokdy.
Work, work.	Iş, iş.
Will definitely be back.	Elbetde gaýdyp geler.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
He didn't know what to think.	Ol näme pikir edýändigini bilmeýärdi.
He looks just like anyone.	Ol edil kim ýaly görünýär.
It was fast.	Bu çalt boldy.
Just fine.	Diňe gowy.
He did not know.	Ol bilmedi.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
Good.	Gowy.
That's bad.	Ine, erbet.
It was great to talk to him.	Ol bilen gürleşmek gaty gowy boldy.
Where are you	Siz nirede?.
They are not us.	Olar biz däl.
There is no way out.	Kän ýol ýok.
This is a very good book.	Bu gaty gowy kitap.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
To help me.	Maňa kömek etmek üçin.
Who knows what he thought.	Kim näme pikir edendigini bilýär.
Here's a tip.	Ine bir maslahat.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
Together these two books are what you need.	Bu iki kitap bilelikde size gerek zat.
It just helped him.	Diňe oňa kömek etdi.
He called a few weeks later.	Birnäçe hepde soň jaň etdi.
Too bad.	Gaty erbet.
She seemed very happy.	Ol gaty bagtly ýalydy.
That's how you should be.	Siz şeýle bolmaly.
No one knows the truth.	Hakykaty hiç kim bilenok.
This was not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däldi.
Then there is the meal.	Soň bolsa nahar bar.
I think about it every day.	Men ony her gün pikir edýärin.
Something like this could be really true.	Munuň ýaly bir zat hakykatdanam dogry bolup biler.
No need.	Gerek däl.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
He did not report to police.	Ol polisiýa habar bermedi.
That's not a word.	Bu söz däl.
I didn't do that.	Men beýle etmedim.
Not only that.	Diňe ol däl.
No one can help anyone.	Hiç kim hiç kime kömek edip bilmez.
He can get whatever he needs.	Näme gerek bolsa, alyp biler.
It seems happy.	Bu bagtly ýaly.
I could not.	Men edip bilmedim.
And then, just like that, he left.	Soň bolsa, edil şonuň ýaly, ol gitdi.
It's not really that far.	Bu hakykatdanam beýle uzak däl.
I'm fine.	Men gowy.
There was a time.	Şol wagt bardy.
Then he called me.	Soň bolsa maňa jaň etdi.
So no one wanted to talk to us.	Şonuň üçin hiç kim biziň bilen gürleşmek islemedi.
In fact, it still exists.	Aslynda henizem bar.
No one else.	Başga hiç kim däl.
The work is not good.	Işi gowy däl.
He didn't, and he knew it.	Ol ýokdy we muny bilýärdi.
There is no way.	Hiç hili ýol ýok.
It can't be more accurate here.	Bu ýerde has dogry bolup bilmez.
No such problem is needed.	Munuň ýaly kynçylyk gerek däl.
This is the police.	Bu polisiýa.
Everyone wants an answer.	Her kim jogap isleýär.
Not many people did.	Köp adam etmedi.
I'm sorry for you.	Seniň üçin gynanýaryn.
There is nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýok.
Too bad for me.	Meniň üçin gaty erbet.
No one knows how to do that.	Muny nädip etmelidigini hiç kim bilenok.
Why not just once?	Näme üçin diňe bir gezek däl?
He couldn't really think about it.	Aslynda bu hakda pikir edip bilmedi.
Like you	Seniň ýaly
He cannot be arrested.	Ony tussag edip bolmaz.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
For good reason.	Gowy sebäp bilen.
They are bad.	Olar erbet.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
Just a word.	Diňe söz.
We have to be better.	Biz has gowy bolmaly.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ol ýerde hiç zat kän däl.
How should we be.	Biz nähili bolmaly.
No one.	Adam ýok.
Work will always be.	Iş hemişe bolar.
To go	Gitmek
This book was good.	Bu kitap gowy boldy.
This is a complete lie.	Bu düýbünden ýalan.
This is not a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk däl.
Maybe somewhere.	Belki, bir ýerde.
He just gave bad advice.	Ol diňe erbet maslahat berdi.
Like one day.	Bir gün ýaly.
She had to be questioned.	Ony sorag etmeli boldy.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
That's what happened.	Şeýle boldy.
Maybe you won't need it right away.	Belki, derrew size gerek bolmaz.
This man, man.	Bu adam, adam.
He can still get it.	Ol entek alyp biler.
Little did he know it would be the last time.	Soňky gezek boljakdygyny bilmeýärdi.
He came to help.	Kömek üçin geldi.
It can be big.	Uly bolup biler.
This is the last person.	Bu iň soňky adam.
This is stupid.	Bu samsyk zat.
It can't be good.	Gowy bolup bilmez.
No way to do it at home.	Öýde etmäge mümkinçilik ýok.
Tell me.	Aýdyň.
That's all you have to do.	Bu seniň etmeli zadyň.
Like him	Ol ýaly.
I can say that.	Muny aýdyp bilerin.
He did not want to see her again.	Ony ýene görmek islemedi.
It didn't work out.	Bu hiç zat etmedi.
Oh, that's great.	Aý, bu gaty gowy.
No more.	Indi ýok.

This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
That's right.	Edil şeýle.
This is indeed the case.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle.
It's a sound.	Bu ses.
I hope he does.	Men muny eder diýip umyt edýärin.
No one.	Biri ýok.
That sounds like a lie.	Bu hem ýalan ýaly.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat däldi.
I'm stupid	Men samsyk.
I did it myself.	Men muny özüm etdim.
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
Debt can destroy you.	Karz sizi ýok edip biler.
The meat is gone.	Et ýok boldy.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
This girl.	Bu gyz.
You, with me.	Sen, meniň bilen.
It is not such a book.	Ol beýle kitap däl.
I need it	Maňa gerek
It was great.	Uly ýalydy.
It can help you.	Size kömek edip biler.
The message is coming.	Habar gelýär.
Someone did it for me.	Biri meniň üçin etdi.
I still can't get it	Men henizem alyp bilemok
They are so beautiful.	Olar şeýle bir owadan.
The girl can really do things there.	Gyz hakykatdanam ol ýerde zatlary edip biler.
This is not very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly däl.
There can be no question about that.	Bu barada hiç hili sorag bolup bilmez.
It's harder to do that.	Muny etmek has kyn.
That alone cannot be said.	Muny diňe aýdyp bolmaz.
This is not the answer.	Bu jogap däl.
Everyone wants that.	Her kim muny isleýär.
I have a lot of doubts about that.	Men muňa gaty şübhelenýärin.
This is too big for me and too big.	Bu meniň üçin gaty uly we gaty uly.
It wasn’t that hard either.	Şeýle hem beýle kyn däldi.
Okay, maybe not good.	Bolýar, belki gowy däl.
Can you do better?	Gowy edip bilersiňizmi?
This is an easy thing to do.	Bu etmek aňsat zat.
Last call.	Iň soňky jaň.
Together with everyone	Hemmeler bilen bilelikde.
If so, he may still be there.	Şeýle bolsa, ol henizem şol ýerde bolup biler.
He will come.	Ol geler.
It happened to me.	Bu meniň bilen boldy.
This is exactly what happened.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
I can't go to it.	Men oňa baryp bilemok.
The two men did not.	Iki adam muny etmedi.
He has a lot to do.	Onuň etmeli köp işi bar.
Someone came for him.	Biri onuň üçin geldi.
Ma'am.	Bu.
It was not yesterday.	Düýn ýokdy.
I can do a lot of damage.	Men köp zyýan alyp bilerin.
Once, twice, then several times.	Bir gezek, iki gezek, soň ýene birnäçe gezek.
I had to call you.	Men saňa jaň etmeli boldum.
He can do two things right now.	Şu wagt iki zady edip biler.
I will be short too.	Men hem gysga bolaryn.
Sing to me, young man.	Maňa aýdym aýdyň, ýaş.
You really can't	Siz hakykatdanam mümkin däl
This is him.	Bu onuň özi.
Three boys, one girl.	Üç ýigit, bir gyz.
He came back once.	Bir gezek gaýdyp geldi.
What a life this is.	Bu nähili durmuş.
That sounds great.	Bu gaty gowy ýaly.
He may think of something better than doing it.	Etmekden has gowy zat hakda pikir edip biler.
We are not a big deal.	Biz uly bir iş däl.
You don't need	Sen mätäç däl
This is not the case for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin beýle däl.
This time it is not.	Bu gezek beýle däl.
He is not alone.	Ol ýeke däl.
He is a serious man.	Ol çynlakaý adam.
There is always something for them.	Olar üçin elmydama bar.
He was also a little surprised.	Ol hem birneme geň galdy.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele.
This too.	Bu hem.
You can get it.	Siz muny alyp bilersiňiz.
How long will it take?	Näçe wagt gerek bolar?
He is a man	Ol adam
It's not fast.	Ol çalt däl.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Because, of course, he would be alone.	Sebäbi, elbetde, ol ýeke bolardy.
Very soon	Köp ýakyn wagt.
I don’t even like it.	Men hatda ony halamok.
There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
It's very interesting.	Ol gaty gyzykly.
We can do that here.	Muny şu ýerde edip bileris.
About it.	Bu hakda.
No one is happy, but no one can do that.	Hiç kim bagtly däl, ýöne hiç kim bu barada hiç zat edip bilmez.
I think he will.	Meniň pikirimçe, eder.
There was no word.	Asla söz ýokdy.
I have to be very happy.	Men gaty bagtly bolmaly.
It's impossible.	Ajaýyp mümkin däl.
I know this is not easy.	Munuň aňsat däldigini bilýärin.
The money is back.	Pul gaýdyp geldi.
It should be the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly bolmaly.
I never wanted to tell you that.	Hiç haçan saňa beýle zat aýtmak islemedim.
How beautiful they are.	Olar nähili owadan.
No one called him.	Hiç kim oňa jaň etmedi.
Something similar happened yesterday and today.	Düýn, şu gün edil şonuň ýaly bir zat boldy.
They are never enough.	Olar hiç haçan ýeterlik däl.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
It was great to see that.	Muny görmek gaty gowy boldy.
This is absolutely wonderful for me.	Bu meniň üçin düýbünden ajaýyp.
He helped me.	Ol maňa kömek etdi.
It's hard to see.	Muny görmek kyn.
This is not a big deal.	Bu hakykatdanam uly bir zat däl.
There were two things for me.	Meniň üçin iki zat bardy.
I got my last job.	Iň soňky işi aldym.
He came to me with difficulty.	Ol maňa kynçylyk bilen geldi.
I think it's here.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýerde.
I told you one.	Men saňa birini aýtdym.
I do not.	Men ýok.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
It's just like him.	Bu edil onuň ýaly.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Mümkin, ýöne ýok.
It's really easy.	Bu hakykatdanam aňsat.
It just doesn't have to be everything there.	Diňe şol ýerde hemme zat ýa-da hiç zat bolmaly däl.
We need to pay attention.	Bize üns bermeli.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
Of course, he can be busy.	Elbetde, ol köp iş bilen meşgul bolup biler.
Someone else did.	Başga biri etdi.
There is also.	Şeýle hem bar.
Not a man.	Bir adam däl.
I didn't see it as such.	Men muny hiç bir iş ýaly görmedim.
Everything has to be new.	Hemme zat täze bolmaly.
A little good.	Biraz gowy.
Life is wonderful.	Durmuş ajaýyp.
Suggestion	Teklip
This, of course, is very strange.	Bu, elbetde, gaty geň.
I will do it myself.	Men özüm ederin.
Great tomorrow	Ertir ajaýyp.
He now welcomed her.	Ol indi ony garşy aldy.
So you are short.	Şonuň üçin sen gysga.
I think it is the first time for everything.	Hemme zat üçin ilkinji gezek bar öýdýän.
It's not bad to be busy.	Iş bilen meşgul bolmak erbet däl.
Now this is really a worry.	Indi bu hakykatdanam biynjalyk.
He knew a lot.	Ol köp zady bilýärdi.
I have enough	Mende ýeterlik.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
He did enough.	Ol ýeterlik etdi.
In fact, there is no problem.	Aslynda hiç hili mesele ýok.
It’s like making a few calls.	Birnäçe jaň etmek ýaly.
This is indeed the case.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle.
Not a bad thing.	Erbet zat däl.
He already knows that.	Ol muny eýýäm bilýär.
No harm done.	Zyýan ýok.
This seems impossible.	Bu mümkin däl ýaly.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
That was the case last night.	Düýn agşam şeýle boldy.
You can try this.	Muny synap görüp bilersiňiz.
Too much.	Gaty köp zat.
Of course, that's what he did.	Elbetde, onuň eden işi.
Of course, there was someone else.	Elbetde, başga biri bardy.
This is not necessarily a good thing.	Bu hökman gowy zat däl.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
There must be something.	Bir zat bolmaly.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
Of course, the problem is not immediate.	Elbetde, mesele derrew däl.
It's easier.	Bu has aňsat.
I had no reason.	Mende hiç hili sebäp ýokdy.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle.
I was not stupid about that.	Men bu barada samsyk däldim.
It seems right.	Dogry ýaly görünýär.
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolar.
This is a great day for me.	Bu meniň üçin ajaýyp gün.
It's actually too early.	Aslynda gaty ir.
It's not you	Bu sen däl
You can only call time.	Diňe wagt jaň edip bilersiňiz.
They are nothing.	Olar hiç zat däl.
He is serious.	Ol çynlakaý.
It was good to see him again.	Ony ýene görmek gowy boldy.
It will satisfy me.	Bu meni razy eder.
They are very bad.	Olar gaty erbet.
There was a problem, not enough.	Kynçylyk bardy, ýeterlik däldi.
Just stop.	Diňe bes et.
There he comes to his senses.	Ol ýerde özüne gelýär.
No one else can.	Başga hiç kim edip bilmez.
It was here.	Bu ýerde boldy.
Only there.	Diňe şol ýere bar.
Long, this time.	Uzak, bu gezek.
He said he had.	Ol bardygyny aýtdy.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
It's not that good.	Bu beýle bir gowy däl.
He got help.	Ol kömek aldy.
Maybe he did it.	Belki, muny eden bolsa gerek.
Of course, this is not an easy task.	Elbetde, bu aňsat iş däl.
There is so much here.	Bu ýerde gaty köp.
It's a wonderful evening.	Bu ajaýyp agşam.
You really can.	Siz hakykatdanam edip bilersiňiz.
She seems to know a lot.	Ol gaty köp bilýän ýaly.
You can make it human again.	Ony ýene adam edip bilersiňiz.
There is one last issue.	Soňky bir mesele bar.
I think this is crazy.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu däli.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
Someone like you or me.	Sen ýa-da seniň ýaly biri.
It doesn't seem to be there.	Ol ýerde ýok ýaly.
Big? 	Uly?
It was not great.	Bu ajaýyp däldi.
I found it very difficult.	Men oňa gaty kyn boldum.
Fast and fun.	Çalt we gyzykly.
It was almost big.	Uly diýen ýalydy.
Only one will.	Diňe biri eder.
This is not difficult.	Bu kyn däl.
That was not enough.	Bu entek ýeterlik däldi.
This is very new.	Bu gaty täze.
There is another way.	Başga ýol bar.
Of course, this is just a lie.	Elbetde, bu diňe ýalan.
I'll do it again.	Men muny ýene ederin.
He didn't think so, he understood.	Ol muny beýle pikir etmedi, düşündi.
I didn't see anything	Men hiç zat görmedim
Then he fell asleep.	Soň bolsa uklap galdy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, elbetde ýok.
I haven't seen it so interesting in a long time.	Köp wagt bäri beýle gyzykly görmedim.
He didn't have to do that.	Ol beýle etmeli däldi.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Bu pikir hakykatdanam dogry bolup biler.
I'm too bad for that.	Men muňa gaty erbet.
I want to talk to you more.	Siz bilen has köp gürleşmek isleýärin.
He said only one or two words.	Ol diňe bir ýa-da iki söz aýtdy.
He didn't give me much of a chance.	Ol maňa kän bir mümkinçilik bermedi.
She was amazed.	Oňa haýran galdy.
This word is a lie.	Bu söz ýalan.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
Of course, I believe in it.	Elbetde, men oňa ynanýaryn.
He was really there for me.	Ol hakykatdanam meniň üçin bardy.
They are also very fun.	Şeýle hem olar gaty hezil.

It happened and it happened.	Bu boldy we boldy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
This is the worst week.	Bu, iň erbet hepde.
Good.	Gowy.
This is really different.	Bu hakykatdanam başga.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe muny etmeli.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
It wasn't really good.	Aslynda gowy däldi.

It helped.	Bu kömek etdi.
I've heard it twice.	Iki gezek eşitdim.
I couldn't get enough	Men ýeterlik bolup bilmedim
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
He doesn't want to talk.	Ol gürleşmek islemeýär.
The answer is the same.	Jogap şol bir ýerde.
No one agrees.	Hiç kim muňa razy däl.
Maybe it could be.	Belki, ol hem bolup biler.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Aslynda bu hakda.
Not as before.	Öňküsi ýaly däl.
Not many people do.	Köp adam beýle däl.
This is also complete.	Bu hem doly.

Only this time it was not fast enough.	Diňe bu gezek ýeterlik çalt däldi.

He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
It was not fun either.	Bu hem gyzykly däldi.
He did just that.	Edil şonuň ýaly etdi.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
So it took a lot of time to visit.	Şonuň üçin baryp görmek üçin gaty köp wagt gerek boldy.
Everyone is different.	Hemmeler başga.
The last few days have been absolutely crazy.	Soňky birnäçe gün düýbünden däli boldy.
In addition.	Mundan başga.
It's not that difficult.	Bu beýle kyn däl.
In fact, you should.	Aslynda etmeli.

You don't have to, but you can.	Gerek däl, ýöne edip bilersiňiz.
Both did.	Ikisi-de etdi.
Because that's the right thing for me.	Sebäbi bu meniň üçin dogry zat.
He cares about you.	Ol sen hakda alada edýär.
I didn't do it today.	Men bu gün etmedim.
It was yesterday.	Bu düýn boldy.
This time it's just a girl.	Bu gezek diňe bir gyz.
It went faster.	Bu has çalt gitdi.
It's been a long time.	Köp boldy.
You will have to do this.	Muny etmeli bolar.
Time to time.	Wagt wagt.
A week later.	Soň bir hepde.

It will come to me.	Maňa geler.
In fact, it doesn't exist.	Aslynda bu bar däl.
It's hard to admit.	Muny boýun almak kyn.
He will do it.	Ol muny eder.
I have no such thing.	Mende beýle zat ýok.
The girl was amazed.	Gyz oňa haýran galdy.
I do not believe so.	Men beýle ynanamok.
That's it.	Ine, şol.

Nor is it enough.	Şeýle hem bu ýeterlik däl.
Good word	Gowy söz.

He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
In fact, it is not.	Aslynda beýle bolmaz.
It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
You are the only one for me.	Sen meniň üçin ýeke-täk.
I hope it will be good for you today as well.	Bu gün hem siziň üçin gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
Everything has been great for years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri hemme zat ajaýyp.
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu dogry däl.

OK, you can relax now.	Bolýar, indi dynç alyp bilersiňiz.
That's what he does.	Ine, ol şeýle edýär.
It will be good.	Ol gowy bolar.
What was there.	Ol ýerde näme bardy.
He didn't know what to think.	Ol näme pikir edýändigini bilmeýärdi.
This time it bothered him.	Bu gezek ony biynjalyk etdi.
I have too much.	Men gaty köp.
Must admit.	Boýun almaly.
So you don't have to worry about me.	Şonuň üçin meniň hakda alada etmeli däl.
Big money.	Uly pul.
Of course, he is right.	Elbetde, dogry aýdýar.
Even so, owning one is still beyond the reach of the average person.	Hatda bu oňa gaty gowy görünýär.
He didn't answer me.	Meniň bilen hiç zat jogap bermedi.
It was really fun.	Hakykatdanam has gyzykly boldy.
There was no money at all.	Asla pul ýokdy.
And then just agree.	Soň bolsa diňe razy.
This is definitely a good thing.	Bu, elbetde, gaty gowy zat.
Good, very bad.	Gowy, gaty erbet.

She is not happy.	Ol bagtly däl.

He made me crazy.	Ol meni däli etdi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň özi edil şol ýerde.
This is not a good reason.	Bu gowy sebäp däl.
I am a good person.	Men gowy adam.
I always want to do something else.	Elmydama başga bir zat etmek isleýärin.
You will need more tomorrow.	Ertir has köp zat gerek bolar.
It's hard to do that.	Muny etmek kyn.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
This is not really a problem.	Bu hakykatdanam mesele däl.
That's what happened.	Ol şeýle boldy.
What happened ?! 	Näme boldy?!
I bought it for you	Men ony siziň üçin satyn aldym
You have to go now.	Indi gitmeli.
Maybe no one paid attention.	Belki, hiç kim üns bermedi.
It's kind of interesting.	Bu bir hili gyzykly.
Okay.	Bolýar.
That was not the case.	Bu mesele däldi.
I am not alone.	Men ýeke däl.
I think it would be good.	Gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
He did not want to see her.	Ol ony görmek islemedi.
I'm fine with that.	Men munuň bilen gowy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Häzirki wagtda bu iş.
He did it well.	Ol muny ajaýyp alyp bardy.
Great, so great.	Ajaýyp, şeýle ajaýyp.
It took us two months.	Bize iki aý gerek boldy.
I actually did.	Aslynda etdim.
I said he could.	Edip biljekdigini aýtdym.
So beautiful	Şeýle bir owadan.
Of course he will.	Elbetde muny eder.
This is not a bad life.	Bu erbet durmuş däl.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
He did not say how difficult it would be for me.	Ol meniň üçin nähili kyn boljakdygyny aýtmady.
This is very worrying.	Bu gaty biynjalyk.
One more thing to do.	Has köp etmeli bir zat.
I just don’t want to go right now.	Diňe şu wagt gitmek islämok.
Next time.	Indiki gezek.
I've seen a lot.	Men gaty köp gördüm.
It's not about the word.	Bu söz hakda däl.
I had to do more.	Has köp zat etmeli boldum.
There are three issues.	Üç mesele bar.
I think this book will help.	Bu kitap kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin.
This is new.	Bu täze.
Many people are good.	Köp adam gowy.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň üçin gowy zat.
Life has been hard for me.	Durmuş meniň üçin kyn boldy.
He will agree with me.	Ol menden razy bolar.
There was something else here.	Bu ýerde başga zat bardy.
It does.	Bu şeýle edýär.
He didn't want to talk.	Ol gürleşmek islemedi.

Nothing else is needed.	Başga hiç zat gerek däl.
She is very young.	Ol gaty ýaş.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy.
Here is what we need.	Bu ýerde bize zerur zatlar bar.
No one knew.	Hiç kim bilmeýärdi.
I'm ready to go.	Men gitmäge taýyn.
To be complete.	Doly bolmak.
It really bothers me.	Hakykatdanam meni biynjalyk edýär.
Not a bit.	Biraz däl.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
He took it for granted.	Ol muny özüne aldy.
He paid attention.	Üns berdi.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
You have to be clear about that.	Bu barada aýdyň bolmaly.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
He did it very well.	Ol muny gaty gowy etdi.
It seems like a lot of work.	Bu iş üçin köp kynçylyk ýaly bolup görünýär.
There was no way for him.	Oňa hiç hili ýol ýokdy.
They are not words yet.	Olar entek söz däl.
I'll be that guy	Men ol ýigit bolaryn
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
Now he seems to know something about it.	Häzir ol hakda bir zat bilýän ýaly.
He could say whatever he wanted.	Islän zadyny aýdyp bilýärdi.
This is something new.	Bu täze zat.
Immediately surprised.	Derrew haýran galdy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
It was a good day.	Bu gowy gün boldy.
One last thing.	Soňky bir zat.
Today is two weeks.	Şu gün iki hepde.
So pleasure is not a good thing.	Şonuň üçin lezzet gowy zat däl.
Today	Bu gün.
He calls to tell me.	Maňa aýtmak üçin jaň edýär.
This is not a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk däl.
He thought a lot.	Ol köp pikir etdi.
It was great.	Bu ajaýyp boldy.
This is a happy life.	Bu bagtly durmuş.
Many people can do that.	Köp adam muny edip biler.
OK, we can't.	Bolýar, edip bilmeris.
Good reason.	Gowy sebäp.
Someone is still there.	Kimdir biri henizem şol ýerde.
Not for nothing or for anyone.	Hiç zat ýa-da hiç kim üçin däl.
I have no idea.	Mende hiç wagt pikir ýok.
You can see that.	Muny görüp bilersiňiz.
Then he decided to do it.	Soň bolsa muny etmek kararyna geldi.
I never thought it would be good.	Munuň gowy bolup biljekdigini hiç wagt pikir etmedim.
So he can't take me.	Şonuň üçin ol meni alyp bilmeýär.
He is at home here.	Ol şu ýerde öýde.
Younger and more beautiful.	Has ýaş we has owadan.
It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
So this issue is very difficult.	Şonuň üçin bu mesele gaty kyn.
He is still here.	Ol henizem şu ýerde.
We can't call the police.	Polisiýa jaň edip bilmeris.
Seems like the worst thing.	Iň erbet zat ýaly.
It could be a good thing.	Gowy zat bolup biler.
It won't be me.	Bu men bolmaz.
I'm doing well.	Men gowy iş edýärin.
It may be interesting to know.	Bilýän gyzykly bolup biler.
Nothing at all about this watch.	Bu sagat hakda asla hiç hili zat ýok.
He seems to be able to see me.	Ol meni görüp bilýän ýaly.
I didn't care about anything else.	Başga zat hakda alada etmedim.
Maybe you will be happy.	Belki bagtly bolarsyňyz.
I think it's good.	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
It didn't happen, but it did.	Bolup bilmedi, ýöne edil şol ýerde.
Elsewhere.	Başga bir ýerde.
He took it from me.	Ol muny menden aldy.
He did not tell me what had happened.	Ol maňa näme bolandygyny aýtmady.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I hope you can do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt edýärin.
I saw it.	Men muny gördüm.
It makes me happy.	Ol meni bagtly edýär.
He was not yet alone, never alone.	Ol henizem däldi, hiç haçan ýeke däldi.
I've heard it all.	Men bu hakda hemmesini eşitdim.
He didn't want to be here.	Ol bu ýerde bolmak islemedi.
I am smart.	Men akylly.
It will be the same with everything.	Hemme zat bilen şeýle bolar.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Belki, belki, belki.
I thought for a while tonight.	Şu gije birneme pikir etdim.
They look completely human.	Olar düýbünden adam ýaly görünýär.
You are not.	Siz beýle däl.
No one really knows this.	Muny hakykatdanam hiç kim bilenok.
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
He did not respond.	Ol muňa jogap bermedi.
You have to go somewhere.	Bir ýere gitmeli.
They weren't necessarily.	Olar hökman däldi.
This is often not the case.	Köplenç beýle däl.
And then something happened.	Soň bolsa bir zat boldy.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Everything was fine there.	Ol ýerde hemme zat gowy boldy.
He didn't really say anything about money.	Ol hakykatdanam pul hakda bir zat aýtmady.
There is a very good reason for this.	Munuň gaty gowy sebäbi bar.
She is very smart.	Ol gaty akylly.
There was enough reason for that.	Munuň üçin ýeterlik sebäbi bardy.
I think he did.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol şeýle etdi.
Not at all, not at all.	Asla däl, asla ýok.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
Life was good today.	Bu gün durmuş gowy boldy.
He needs attention.	Oňa üns gerek.
What happened now.	Häzirki wagtda näme boldy.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
It looks serious.	Çynlakaý görünýär.
She had to answer.	Oňa jogap bermeli boldy.
So there is nothing to worry about.	Şonuň üçin alada etmeli zat ýok.
With	Bilen.
This is not a new day.	Bu täze gün däl.
He called.	Jaň etdi.
You know	Bilýärsiň.
He hadn't thought that before.	Ol eýýäm beýle pikir etmedi.
I didn't know that.	Men muny bilmeýärdim.
I think it's there.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ýerde.
It was the same with him.	Ol hem edil şonuň ýalydy.
It's as if everyone knows something.	Her kim bir zady bilýän ýaly.
Sorry, something went wrong.	Bagyşlaň, bir ýalňyşlyk boldy.
Not just a good idea.	Diňe gowy pikir däl.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Şeýle hem bolmaly däl.
It turned out well.	Gowy çykdy.
It took time.	Wagt gerek boldy.
He ignored it.	Ol muňa üns bermedi.
In good time	Gowy wagtda.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
He knew he had to do something about it.	Ol bu barada bir zat etmelidigini bilýärdi.
He had a new problem.	Oňa täze bir kynçylyk geldi.
There must be someone somewhere.	Bir ýerde biri bolmaly.
Unfortunately, he did not think so.	Erbet, ol beýle pikir etmedi.
Probably.	Mümkin.
This is the easiest way.	Bu iň aňsat ýol.
The debt is huge.	Karz gaty uly.
That could be bad.	Bu erbet bolup biler.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
Only me and her.	Diňe men we onuň.
Not yet.	Entek beýle däl.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe bir pikir bermeli.
I got something else	Başga bir zat aldym
This can be difficult, but not impossible.	Bu kyn bolup biler, ýöne mümkin däl.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
Of course he wants to see her again.	Elbetde, ony ýene görmek isleýär.
There is something strange.	Geň bir zat bar.
Good.	Gowy.
No one ever questioned that.	Hiç kim muny asla sorag etmedi.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
He knows this.	Muny özi bilýär.
You are here.	Sen şu ýerde.
He took it twice.	Iki gezek aldy.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
This is a really bad thing.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet zat.
You have to get one, they are great.	Birini almaly, olar ajaýyp.
That would always be the case.	Elmydama şeýle bolardy.
He said something very bad.	Ol gaty erbet zatlar aýtdy.
We are here.	Biz bu ýerde.
That man was crazy.	Ol adam däli boldy.
He knew everything about me.	Ol meniň hakda hemme zady bilýärdi.
I don't want to do that	Men muny etmek islämok
He must have thought about it.	Ol bu barada pikir eden bolmaly.
He thinks it's impossible.	Mümkin däl diýip pikir edýär.
There was a close call yesterday.	Düýn ýakyn jaň boldy.
About time.	Wagt hakda.
Only here, now, was there.	Diňe şu ýerde, indi bardy.
Of course he will.	Elbetde eder.
This thing can go away.	Bu zat gidip biler.
He called again, as before.	Öňküsi ýaly, ýene jaň etdi.
There is another.	Başga biri bar.
I will call every evening.	Her gün agşam jaň ederin.
We don't need it anymore.	Bize indi gerek däl.
It would be great for everyone.	Her kim üçin ajaýyp bolardy.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
No one else could.	Başga hiç kim edip bilmedi.
I don't need money	Maňa pul gerek däl
It may take years.	Birnäçe ýyl gerek bolup biler.
It seemed too far.	Bu gaty uzak ýalydy.
This also bothered him.	Bu hem ony biynjalyk etdi.

Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
This is always the case.	Elmydama şeýle bolýar.

For good reason.	Gowy sebäp bilen.
I called to tell you.	Saňa aýtmak üçin jaň etdim.
No one paid attention to us.	Hiç kim bize üns bermedi.
If you have something to say, say it.	Bir zat aýtmaly bolsa, aýdyň.
Of course I can.	Elbetde edip bilerin.
This is really serious.	Bu hakykatdanam çynlakaý.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Long, yes.	Uzak, şeýle.
You don't seem to be.	Siz beýle däl ýaly.
I think that should be the case.	Meniň pikirimçe, şeýle bolmaly.
He didn't care.	Oňa alada etmedi.
He did not want help.	Ol kömek islemedi.
This is exactly the style of governing the country that he has used in Russia.	Bu edil şu gün.
Every last.	Her soňky.
It looks very beautiful, but very false.	Gaty owadan görünýär, ýöne gaty ýalan.
He thought it was today.	Ol şu gün diýip pikir etdi.
The book is great.	Kitap gaty gowy.
He was not at home.	Ol öýde ýokdy.
I think this is happy.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu bagtly.
He made her smart.	Ony akylly etdi.
It wasn't bad.	Bu erbet däldi.
They are right there.	Olar edil şol ýerde.

Good.	Gowy.
Sounds good.	Gowy ýaly.
Do it by voice.	Ses bilen etmek.
This is for him.	Bu onuň üçin.

We are not really alone.	Ikimizem aslynda ýeke däl.
We can do whatever it takes.	Näme gerek bolsa, edip bileris.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
He is everywhere.	Ol hemme ýerde.
It's something like life.	Bu durmuş ýaly bir zat.
He is here this morning.	Ol şu gün irden şu ýerde.
He never needed me.	Ol maňa hiç wagt mätäç däldi.
He had to go.	Ol gitmeli boldy.
It always takes time.	Munuň üçin elmydama wagt gerek.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
I thought you were.	Sen diýip pikir etdim.
You need	Saňa gerek .
No one paid attention before.	Öň hiç kim üns bermedi.

Okay, not this morning.	Bolýar, şu gün irden däl.
Maybe they're not that good.	Belki, olar beýle gowy däl bolsa gerek.

This is just a man.	Bu diňe bir adam.
I did it.	Men muny eden men.
This was suggested by several people.	Muny birnäçe adam teklip etdi.
Only a month left.	Diňe bir aý galdy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň özi doly.
I could not answer.	Men jogap berip bilmedim.
That must be good.	Bu gowy bolsa gerek.
Because there really is no problem here.	Sebäbi bu ýerde hakykatdanam mesele ýok.
There he seemed to need it.	Ol ýerde oňa mätäç ýalydy.
No one knows everything.	Hiç kim hemme zady bilmeýär.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gaty gowy boldy.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Men edip bilemok, edip bilemok, edip bilemok.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.

That's it.	Edil şu.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
You also have to be smart.	Şeýle hem akylly bolmaly.
It can't seem like a big deal.	Uly bir zat ýaly bolup bilmez.
It was so bad.	Bu gaty erbet boldy.
They are not alone.	Olar ýeke däl.
The next issue.	Indiki mesele.

It was good to talk to you.	Siziň bilen gürleşmek gowy boldy.

This is really difficult.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn.
I just have to say it.	Men muny diňe aýtmaly.
It's too late.	Ol gaty gijä galdy.
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat.
That makes me bad.	Bu meni erbet edýär.
Nothing, not even.	Hiç zat däl, hatda.
No need.	Gerek däldi.
It can't be fast for you.	Bu siziň üçin çalt bolup bilmez.

He did so last year.	Geçen ýyl şeýle etdi.
He called three times.	Üç gezek jaň etdi.
So he may not do that anymore.	Şonuň üçin indi beýle etmezligi mümkin.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
A lot of things don’t seem to have helped.	Köp zat kömek eden ýaly däl.
That alone is not enough.	Munuň özi ýeterlik däl.
He didn't need me for that.	Ol munuň üçin maňa mätäç däldi.
He seems to know a lot about it.	Bu hakda köp zat bilýän ýaly.
I can think of a song.	Bir aýdym hakda pikir edip bilerin.
It's been a month.	Şeýle aý boldy.
That's great.	Ajaýyp zat.
From now on.	Mundan beýläk.
You could say goodbye.	Gowy diýip bilersiňiz.
What happened?	Bu näme boldy.
It seemed good.	Gowy ýalydy.
That was not the question.	Bu sorag däldi.
Now he understands more and more how this can happen.	Munuň nähili bolup biljekdigine indi has köp düşündi.
And then he can't speak.	Soň bolsa gürläp bilenok.
This question did not exist at all.	Bu sorag düýbünden ýokdy.
It's been a long time coming.	Uzak wagt boldy.
It's hard for me.	Meniň üçin kyn.
So it must be very good.	Şonuň üçin gaty gowy bolmaly.
He does not question that.	Ol muny sorag etmeýär.
He thought it was good.	Ol gowy diýip pikir etdi.
I thought about it and thought about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etdim we pikir etdim.
Maybe in another way.	Belki başga bir ýol bilen bolup biler.
Serious, but good.	Çynlakaý, ýöne gowy.
You are not	Siz ýok.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Go to school	Mekdebe gitmek.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmeli däl.
There is another reason.	Başga bir sebäp bar.
He needs money.	Oňa pul gerek.
This is absolutely crazy.	Bu düýbünden däli.
Tell me why this bothers you.	Munuň näme üçin sizi biynjalyk edýändigini aýdyň.
He knows everything.	Ol hemme zady biler.
Not three.	Üç däl.
He could have been a happier person.	Oňa bagtly adam bolup bilýärdi.
We can never go there.	Biz hiç haçan ol ýere baryp bilmeris.
He was not there before.	Ozal ol ýerde ýokdy.
Thought and thought.	Pikir we pikir.
I'm not stupid at all.	Men düýbünden samsyk däl.
I actually thought about doing it.	Aslynda muny etmek hakda pikir etdim.
It was a lot of fun.	Gaty hezil boldy.
No one.	Hiç kim.
There will be good news about this.	Bu hakda gowy habar bolar.
This time it happened.	Bu gezek şeýle boldy.
About vacation.	Dynç almak hakda.
It seems to be true, it is not.	Dogry ýaly bolup görünýär, beýle däl.
We can answer this in two ways.	Muňa iki ýol bilen jogap berip bileris.
What did he do?	Ol näme etdi.
There is never much good.	Hiç haçan gowy zat kän däl.
I know a lot about him, but not everything.	Men ol hakda köp zat bilýärin, ýöne hemme zat däl.
This will not be enough.	Bu ýeterlik bolmaz.
It seemed impossible.	Bu mümkin däl ýalydy.
He did not know what he was thinking.	Ol hakda näme pikir edýändigini bilmeýärdi.
New every year.	Her ýyl täze.
Now there was nothing he could do about it.	Indi bu hakda edip biljek zady ýokdy.
There is no one here.	Bu ýerde asla hiç kim ýok.
Not so beautiful now.	Indi beýle ajaýyp däl.
It was a good time for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin gowy wagt boldy.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
Faster.	Has çalt.
A lot of people are already doing this.	Muny eýýäm köp adam edýär.
Everyone.	Hemmeler.
He never had time.	Onuň hiç wagt wagty ýokdy.
This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
If it's fast, it's clear.	Çalt bolsa, aýdyň.
It didn't hurt.	Bu erbet pikir etmedi.
If so, that's a good idea.	Şeýle bolsa, gowy pikir.
I didn't think so.	Men pikir etmedim.
I called.	Men jaň etdim.
This was not what he needed from me.	Bu onuň menden zerur zady däldi.
I was not.	Men beýle däldim.
There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
The police did not tell us.	Polisiýa bize hiç zat aýtmady.
She was amazed.	Oňa haýran galdy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle bolmaly.
It is very easy to buy.	Satyn almak gaty aňsat.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu sebäp boldy.
I had a better idea.	Mende has gowy pikir bardy.
Of course I will be there again.	Elbetde, ýene şol ýerde bolaryn.
He thought it was fun.	Ol hezil diýip pikir etdi.
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däl.
I also got this right away.	Bu hem derrew aldym.
I could see it.	Men ony görüp bilýärdim.
He needs more.	Oňa has köp zat gerek.
Such a difficult, difficult thing.	Şeýle kyn, kyn zat.
There was no man.	Adam ýokdy.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
This is not the answer.	Bu jogap däl.
This is a difficult meal.	Bu kyn nahar.
It could be faster.	Bu has çalt bolup biler.
We can't go there.	Biz ol ýere baryp bilmeris.
It was good for me.	Bu maňa gowy boldy.
I want to help her.	Men oňa kömek etmek isleýärin.
He had to rest.	Ol dynç almaly boldy.
I had to decide.	Men karar bermeli boldum.
Also	Şeýle hem
He did a lot for me.	Ol meniň üçin köp zat etdi.
About these things.	Bu zatlar hakda.
It seems very crazy.	Bu gaty däli ýaly.
This can take a long time.	Bu köp wagt alyp biler.
There can be no more question about this issue now.	Indi bu mesele barada başga sorag bolup bilmez.
He did not want to know everything about her.	Ol hakda hemme zady bilmek islemedi.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa biraz ynanamok.
Easy to answer.	Jogap bermek aňsat.
It won't be beautiful.	Bu owadan bolmaz.
He was there.	Ol ýerde bardy.
Being in the right place at the right time.	Dogry wagtda dogry ýerde bolmak.
That can't be really easy.	Bu hakykatdanam aňsat bolup bilmez.
She thought she must be a girl.	Ol gyz bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
There was always a reason.	Elmydama bir sebäp bardy.
The answer confirms this fact.	Jogap bu hakykaty boýun aldy.
She is no longer beautiful.	Ol indi owadan däl.
Now it's different with you.	Indi seniň bilen başga.
Sing about it.	Bu hakda aýdym aýdyň.
What else does he know.	Başga näme bilýär.
It looks great.	Bu ajaýyp görünýär.
I have to stop thinking about it.	Men ol hakda pikir etmegi bes etmeli.
You need to get more.	Has köp zat almaly.
Very close to that.	Munuň üçin gaty ýakyn.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
I don't need them.	Maňa olar maňa mätäç däl.
This is really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy bolýar.
It looks very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly görünýär.
She is also very beautiful.	Ol hem gaty owadan.
Great	Ajaýyp.
The problem is still there.	Mesele henizem bar.
We are never alone.	Biz hiç haçan ýeke däl.
This is not new.	Bu täze däl.
Where are you now	Sen şu wagt nirede?
Of course, this cannot be against me.	Elbetde, bu maňa garşy bolup bilmez.
The strangest thing happened to me yesterday.	Iň geň mesele düýn maňa boldy.
I'm with him.	Men onuň bilen.
Okay, now he is.	Bolýar, indi ol.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Onuň üçin hiç hili erbet zat ýok.
A lot of people seemed really interesting.	Köp adam hakykatdanam gyzykly ýalydy.
Great for that.	Diňe munuň üçin ajaýyp.
He knows everything about someone.	Kimdir biri hakda hemme zady bilýär.
He was not a bad person.	Erbet adam däldi.
Maybe next summer.	Belki indiki tomus.
They were there.	Olar düýbünden bardy.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
I never saw it.	Men muny asla görmedim.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
Smart and smart.	Akylly we akylly.
He didn't want to.	Derrew islemedi.
I think? 	Meniň pikirimçe?
This is not a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk däl.
Many people do.	Köp adam edýär.
Two hours later.	Iki sagat soň.
This is about me.	Bu men hakda.
I'm very bad.	Men gaty erbet.
I didn't expect that to happen.	Beýle bolar diýip umyt etmedim.
You have to do this for me.	Muny meniň üçin etmeli.
This seems unlikely.	Bu ähtimal däl ýaly.
I really enjoyed it.	Mundan gaty lezzet aldym.
He did very well there.	Ol ýerde gaty gowy etdi.
Faster and better.	Has çalt we has gowy.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Nothing.	Hiç zat däl.
This is coming.	Bu gelýär.
They were nothing.	Olar hiç zat däldi.
It will take money.	Munuň üçin pul gerek bolar.
A short time ago	Gysga wagt öň
It works well.	Gowy iş edýär.
He didn't have to do what he did.	Eden zadyny etmeli däldi.
You're just there.	Sen diňe şol ýerde.
I am the police	Men polisiýa
Fast and.	Çalt we.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
He had to do it.	Ol etmeli boldy.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Onuň gitmeli wagty geldi.
This is a bad apology.	Bu erbet ötünç.
I hope it will be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
Why not, no good reason.	Näme üçin ýok, gowy sebäp ýok.
Maybe with him.	Belki, onuň bilen.
This too.	Bu hem.
They are not as beautiful as we are.	Olar biziň ýaly owadan däl.
It has been a very bad year.	Bu gaty erbet ýyl boldy.
What are we going to do with you?	Biz siziň bilen näme etjek?
He doesn't even know what he wants.	Hatda näme isleýändigini bilenok.
I agree.	Men razy.
He must be here.	Ol şu ýerde bolmaly.
which one would be great 	haýsy ajaýyp bolar?
???.	???.
It happens here every day.	Bu her gün bu ýerde bolýar.
It was only one day.	Bu diňe bir gün boldy.
The same thing happens there.	Şol bir zat şol ýerde bolýar.
Okay, he could see that.	Bolýar, muny görüp bilýärdi.
This is either true or false.	Bu ýa dogry ýa-da ýalan.
He said it was not.	Ol beýle däldigini aýtdy.
He never wanted to talk about it.	Ol hiç haçan bu hakda gürleşmek islemedi.
This is strange.	Bu, iň geň zat.
No more there.	Indi ol ýerde ýok.
It's good to know.	Diňe bilmek gowy.
I have more.	Mende has köp zat bar.
It won't be for you.	Ol seniň üçin bolmaz.
Like a lot of work.	Gaty köp iş ýaly.
It can't be.	Bolup bilmez.
This is a way.	Bu bir ýol.
I want this a lot.	Men muny köp isleýärin.
I'm not doing too badly.	Men gaty erbet iş etmeýärin.
I have never seen such a thing before.	Ozal beýle zady görmedim.
Always a boy and a girl.	Elmydama ýigit we gyz.
Big things.	Uly zatlar.
Nothing happened there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat bolup bilmedi.
Everything is bad, bad, bad.	Hemme zat erbet, erbet, erbet.
Surprisingly, this does not seem to be the case.	Geň zat, bu aňsat däl ýaly.
I think there should be more.	Has köp bolmaly diýip pikir edýärin.
I need something else.	Maňa ýene bir zat gerek.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat gowy.
He is nowhere.	Ol hiç ýerde däl.
I do it myself.	Men muny özüm edýärin.
This is not a worry.	Bu biynjalyk däl.
I'm worried.	Meni biynjalyk edýär.
You will do it.	Sen muny etjek.
It's better there.	Ol ýerde has gowy.
It's easy for me.	Bu meniň üçin aňsat.
I called him one day.	Men oňa bir gün jaň etdim.
A lot has happened here a while ago.	Köp zat bu ýerde birneme öň bardy.
He could not sleep.	Ol uklap bilmedi.
I think that's weird.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu geň.
One thing he knows he has to do.	Etmelidigini bilýän bir zat.
It will be really difficult to know.	Muny bilmek hakykatdanam kyn bolar.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
He did not want to go	Gitmek islemedi
It was just for fun.	Diňe hezil üçin boldy.
It will be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolar.
I don't have to be bad.	Meni erbet etmek hökman däl.
That's great.	Bu uly.
He didn't want anything for himself.	Ol özi üçin hiç zat islemedi.
Because nothing, nothing.	Sebäbi hiç zat ýok, hiç zat ýok.
Beautiful face.	Owadan ýüz.
He said this.	Ol muny aýtdy.
This is not a good reason.	Bu gowy sebäp däl.
What can we do to help?	Näme kömek edip bileris?
It will be.	Bolar.
Of course he knew that.	Elbetde, muny bilýärdi.
He could still speak.	Ol henizem gürläp bilýärdi.
We can do it together.	Biz bilelikde edip bileris.
Another person.	Başga adam.
Maybe there's something wrong.	Belki ýalňyşlyk bar bolsa gerek.
This can take longer.	Bu has köp wagt alyp biler.
That's a lot.	Bu köp.
He didn't tell me.	Ol maňa aýtmady.
How bad can that be? 	Bu nähili erbet bolup biler?
He said he understood, of course.	Ol, elbetde, düşündi diýdi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
This is not necessarily a bad thing.	Bu hökman erbet zat bolup bilmez.
He cannot be persuaded.	Ony razy edip bolmaz.
Not just at the same time.	Diňe bir wagtda däl.
This is what happened here.	Bu ýerde şu boldy.
This is indeed possible.	Bu hakykatdanam mümkin.
The first time he was very smart.	Ilkinji gezek gaty akylly boldy.
I only care about you.	Men diňe sen hakda alada edýärin.
Whatever it is.	Aslynda näme bolsa.
This was never the right time.	Bu hiç wagt gaty dogry wagt däldi.
I thought we could be together last night.	Soňky gije bile bolup bileris öýdüpdim.
Both or both may be correct.	Ikisi ýa-da ikisi hem dogry bolup biler.
It was impossible to see.	Görmek mümkin däldi.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
How can we do that?	Muny nädip edip bileris?
About it.	Bu hakda.
No one knew anything or anyone.	Hiç kim hiç zady ýa-da hiç kimi bilmeýärdi.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
He took something from me.	Ol menden bir zat aldy.
Nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýok.
This morning	Bu düýn irden.
The sound is good, it can be a little good.	Ses gowy, biraz gowy bolup biler.
Not everyone is like you.	Hemmeler seniň ýaly däl.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Hakykatdanam, şu gün başga bir ýerde boldy.
The sooner the better, the better.	Näçe ir bolsa gowy gitdi.
Not many people know that.	Muny köp adam bilmeýär.
It seems like everything will never happen.	Hemme zat hiç wagt bolmaz ýaly.
He wanted to do it.	Ol bu işi etjek boldy.
I don’t know how to do that.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilemok.
"It simply came to our notice then," he said.	Ol: "Bu men bolup bilerin" -diýdi.
Right here and now.	Edil şu ýerde we häzir.
In fact, I know this is not the case.	Aslynda munuň beýle däldigini bilýärin.
This is not really surprising.	Bu hakykatdanam geň däl.
This is no longer the case.	Indi bu mesele däl.
New to work	Işe täze
Not much.	Gaty bir zat ýok.
Maybe there was no time for that.	Belki, munuň üçin wagty ýokdy.
Money is good too.	Pul hem gowy.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
The police knew.	Polisiýa bilýärdi.
Someone had to do something.	Kimdir biri bir zat etmeli boldy.
This is not the only case.	Bu diňe bir däl.
This is what everyone wants.	Bu hemmeler isleýär.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
I hope it is good for you.	Ol siziň üçin gowy diýip umyt edýärin.
I'm thinking of two now.	Men häzir iki hakda pikir edýärin.
I knew it.	Men muny bilýärdim.
Now the problem.	Indi mesele.
Big guy	Uly ýigit.
It will be tonight, or it will never be.	Bu gije bolar, ýa-da asla bolmaz.
He paid close attention.	Ol çalt üns berdi.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
We can't do that.	Muny edip bilmeris.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Every job is hard.	Her bir iş kyn.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň etjek bolýan zady.
This is something completely new.	Bu düýbünden täze zat.
Interesting and giving.	Gyzykly we bermek.
He thought so.	Ol şeýle pikir etdi.
He has to go.	Ol gitmeli.
Of course, this is not necessarily the case.	Elbetde, bu hökman dogry däl.
He decided.	Ol karar berdi.
This morning	Bu gün irden.
It is there, but it is not.	Ol ýerde bar, ýöne ýok.
To tell the truth here.	Bu ýerde hakykaty aýtmak üçin.
Maybe he doesn't know.	Belki bilmez.
In fact, it is easy.	Aslynda bu aňsat.
There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
He took it very badly.	Ol muny gaty erbet aldy.
This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
Three years	Üç ýyl
There is something about them.	Olar hakda bir zat bar.
I didn’t know it would be so great.	Munuň beýle ajaýyp boljakdygyny bilmedim.
I need a job.	Maňa iş gerek.
I saw how this could be.	Munuň nähili bolup biljekdigini gördüm.
We are full.	Biz doly.
You don't need money	Size pul gerek däl
There was a time.	Şol wagt bardy.
It's also easy to do.	Muny etmek hem aňsat.
I called him.	Men oňa jaň etdim.
It was like another morning.	Bu gün irden başga bir gün ýalydy.
Just like now	Edil häzirki ýaly.
That didn't make me happy.	Bu meni bagtly etmedi.
The new year has come.	Täze ýyl geldi.
You did it.	Muny eden sen.
It also helped a lot.	Bu hem köp kömek etdi.
He wanted, he wanted.	Ol isledi, isledi.
This is always the case.	Elmydama şeýle bolýar.
He wants to be with you.	Ol siziň bilen bolmak isleýär.
They are not just words.	Olar diňe bir söz däl.
One thing is for sure.	Bu hakda bir zat maňa dogry däl.
The only thing I can see.	Diňe görüp bilýän bir zady.
He knew what.	Näme bilýärdi.
It looked really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy ýalydy.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It started to get interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolup başlady.
It will not be the last.	Iň soňky bolmaz.
It is also not necessary.	Şeýle hem zerur däl.
No more.	Indi ýok.
I have everything.	Mende bar zat bar.
I bought something for myself.	Men özüm üçin bir zat satyn aldym.
I don't have to be happy.	Men bagtly bolmaly däl.
It was bad.	Bu erbet boldy.
It's just too hard.	Diňe gaty kyn.
This is more difficult.	Bu has kyn.
It was like a road to go.	Bu gitmeli ýol ýalydy.
Almost never.	Hiç haçan ýok diýen ýaly.
It will always be there.	Elmydama şol ýerde bolar.
Everyone has a good time.	Her kimiň wagty gowy.
Anyone want to try this out?	Muny synap görmek isleýän barmy?
Not once.	Bir gezek däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe bir zat.
No one paid attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa üns bermedi.
Good for you.	Munuň üçin saňa gowy.
You will have to go with us.	Biz bilen bile gitmeli bolarsyňyz.
I couldn't do that.	Men beýle edip bilmedim.
This is a really bad decision.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet karar.
Is that still the case?	Bu henizem şeýlemi?
Probably more than me.	Menden has köp bolsa gerek.
He wanted to do it all.	Ol hemmesini etjek boldy.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
Not new.	Täze zatlar däl.
This is a job.	Bu bir iş.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gaty dogry sorag.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ol indi alyp bilmedi.
I couldn't think of that.	Men beýle pikir edip bilmedim.
He is with someone else.	Ol başga biri bilen.
It's really bad.	Aslynda gaty erbet.
I didn't think so.	Beýle bolar öýdemokdym.
Not for me but for them.	Meniň üçin olar üçin däl.
It will be good for him.	Oňa gowy bolar.
No one could see.	Hiç kim görüp bilmedi.
Of course, the same person.	Elbetde, şol bir adam.
Because he is so stupid.	Sebäbi gaty samsyk.
And then home.	Soň bolsa öýe.
Now everyone is for themselves.	Indi her bir adam özi üçin.
Immediately the two prisoners went with us.	Derrew iki tussag biziň bilen gitdi.
She is beautiful everywhere, everywhere.	Ol hemme ýerde, hemme ýerde owadan.
Is that right here?	Ine, şu ýerde?
He is already gone.	Ol eýýäm gitdi.
Because it is never the case.	Sebäbi hiç wagt beýle däl.
How was that?	Bu nähili boldy?
This is not the right word.	Bu dogry söz däl.
I couldn't do it anymore.	Indi edip bilmedim.
I need more.	Maňa has köp zat gerek.
He really did something wrong with you.	Ol hakykatdanam seniň bilen erbet iş etdi.
She is not happy yet.	Ol henizem bagtly däl.
He never did these things.	Ol bu zatlary hiç wagt etmedi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
It works great and is a bit fast.	Bu gaty gowy iş edýär we birneme çalt.
It's very easy to go.	Gitmek gaty aňsat.
I can't say anything anymore.	Men indi hiç zat aýdyp biljek däl.
Very young man.	Gaty ýigit.
He didn't want anything.	Bar zady islemedi.
He doesn't want to be good.	Ol gowy bolmak islemeýär.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
That can't be good.	Bu gowy bolup bilmez.
There is only one or the other.	Diňe bir ýa-da başga bir zat bar.
It can't be.	Ol bolup bilmez.
We will never be.	Biz asla bolmaz.
Of course, he knew nothing.	Elbetde, ol hiç zady bilmeýärdi.
He was not much.	Ol köp adam däldi.
It was like three people.	Üç adam ýalydy.
Too many words.	Gaty köp söz.
Doing this again.	Muny ýene bir gezek etmek.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
Nothing like this will happen.	Munuň ýaly başga zat bolmaz.
Not there.	Ol ýerde däl.
I care about you the most.	Men seniň üçin bu barada iň köp alada edýärin.
How was that?	Bu nähili boldy?
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
Of course, he started talking.	Elbetde, ol gürläp başlady.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu şeýle bolmaly, sebäbi bu gaty görünýär.
There are always more.	Hemişe zatlar has köp bolýar.
He lives there.	Ol şol ýerde ýaşaýar.
The food is great.	Nahar ajaýyp.
He didn't even think about it.	Ol hatda pikir etmedi.
This may be a bit strange.	Bu birneme geň bolup biler.
He did not vote yesterday.	Düýn ses bermedi.
This is bad for business.	Bu iş üçin erbet.
There is no idea.	Ol ýerde pikir ýok.
This will never happen.	Bu hiç haçan bolmaz.
This is not a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk däl.
That's exactly what you did.	Edil seniň eden zadyň.
It happens almost every morning.	Her gün irden diýen ýaly bolýar.
He took me home.	Ol meni öýüne alyp gitdi.
I couldn't even think.	Men hatda pikir edip bilmedim.
Maybe he doesn't think so.	Belki, beýle pikir etmeýär.
It's just not possible.	Bu diňe mümkin däl.
They are very smart.	Olar gaty akylly.
Here and now.	Şu ýerde we häzir.
This, of course, was difficult for me.	Bu, elbetde, meniň üçin kyn boldy.
This does not have to be the case.	Munuň beýle bolmagy hökman däl.
I grieve every day.	Men her gün gynanýaryn.
Another life.	Başga bir durmuş.
It seemed interesting.	Gyzykly ýalydy.
I can't go to the police.	Men polisiýa baryp bilemok.
There will be a lot of bad things.	Köp erbet zatlar bolar.

She was very worried.	Ol gaty biynjalyk boldy.
No one knew.	Hiç kim hiç zat bilmeýärdi.

What a word.	Näme söz.
It can even help you.	Ol hatda size kömek edip biler.
He bought it.	Ol satyn aldy.
You don't have to be anything.	Saňa hiç zat bolmaly däl.

You can get a little too loud.	Biraz gaty ses alyp bilersiňiz.
It was crazy.	Bu däli boldy.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
They are beautiful and everything is beautiful.	Olar owadan we hemme zat owadan.
What a strange word.	Nähili geň söz.
I definitely agree.	Men hökman razy.
I no longer needed what I could give.	Maňa indi berip biljek zatlary gerek däldi.
I hope you don't have to do that anymore.	Mundan beýläk beýle etmeli däl diýip umyt edýärin.
This is a completely different matter.	Bu düýbünden başga mesele.
Sing, sing, sing.	Aýdym, aýdym aýdyň, aýdym aýdyň.
Good.	Gowy.
He knew he had to.	Etmeli däldigini bilýärdi.
He didn't tell me about you and the last night.	Ol maňa sen we soňky gije hakda aýtmady.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, muny bilýär.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
The first three years were wonderful.	Ilkinji üç ýyl ajaýyp boldy.
This book is here to help you.	Bu kitap size kömek etmek üçin şu ýere gelýär.
It went faster.	Ol has çalt gitdi.
Great for them.	Olar üçin ajaýyp.

In fact, they are different.	Hakykatdanam, olar düýbünden başga zat.
Nothing, nothing.	Hiç zat, hiç zat.
It really happened to me.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň bilen boldy.
It looks weird.	Geň görünýär.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
This is the last day.	Bu soňky gün.
I think that's a good idea.	Bu gaty gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin.
This is another one.	Bu onuň başga biri.
That was not the question.	Bu sorag däldi.
You are not for me.	Meniň üçin sen däl.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I know what he's thinking.	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilýärin.
This time he got it.	Ol bu gezek aldy.
Too much work for me.	Meniň üçin gaty köp iş.

Great help during working hours.	Iş wagty gaty uly kömek.
This is not something to worry about.	Bu alada etmeli zat däl.

I was worried about you here.	Men bu ýerde özüňiz hakda alada etdim.
I think this is great.	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir edýärin.
Two or three hours.	Iki ýa-da üç sagat.
It was almost there at the time.	Şol wagt diýen ýaly bardy.
Why bother with it?	Näme üçin ony biynjalyk etmeli?
He lives now and forever.	Ol häzir we hemişe ýaşaýar.
Here's another one.	Ine, başga biri.
At home.	Öýde.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
This is a crazy lie.	Bu däli ýalan.
You can always do something new.	Elmydama täze bir zat edip bilersiňiz.
Not much.	Gaty bir zat ýok.
It doesn't seem to be here.	Bu ýerde däl ýaly.
Of course, he did nothing wrong.	Elbetde, hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedi.

Oh, this is crazy.	Aý, bu däli.
In fact, it may be smart.	Aslynda bu akylly bolup biler.

You are a wonderful person.	Siz hakykatdanam ajaýyp adam.
I said.	Men aýtdym.
He can never do that here.	Muny bu ýerde hiç wagt edip bilmeýär.
I'll have to call	Men jaň etmeli bolaryn
This was not the case at all.	Bu asla beýle däldi.
Not bad money.	Erbet pul däl.
A bit likely.	Biraz ähtimal.
She was worried.	Ol alada galdy.
You are not a police officer.	Siz polisiýa däl.
This has always been the case.	Bu hemişe şeýle boldy.
We are with you!	Biz siziň bilen!
He is this morning.	Ol şu gün irden.
I don't want to talk to you.	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek islämok.
Maybe he can't say anything.	Belki, ol hiç zat aýdyp bilmez.
He likes it.	Ol muny halaýar.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Bu hakykatdanam ýeterlik bolmaly.
This time it was.	Bu wagt şeýle boldy.
I have something.	Mende bir zat bar.
There was no one to help me.	Maňa kömek etjek adam ýokdy.
Everything was fast.	Hemme zat çalt boldy.
It wasn't much for me.	Meniň üçin bu kän däldi.
This is not a new issue.	Bu täze mesele däl.
Like the last road.	Iň soňky ýol ýaly.
With almost everything.	Köp zat bilen diýen ýaly.
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
Of course, it may take some time.	Elbetde, birnäçe wagt gerek bolup biler.
There are a lot of problems nowadays.	Häzirki wagtda köp kynçylyk.
It was like that.	Ine, onuň ýalydy.
Maybe a little too good.	Belki gaty gowy biraz.
Must give to get.	Almak üçin bermeli.
Strange, good.	Geň, gowy.
This can take a long time.	Bu gaty köp wagt alyp biler.
She was amazed.	Ol muňa haýran galdy.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.

Everyone helped.	Hemmeler kömek etdi.
I couldn't buy it anymore.	Indi satyn alyp bilmedim.
You know a little bit.	Biraz bilýärsiň.
No one wanted to hire him.	Hiç kim ony işe almak islemedi.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
They are very interesting.	Olar gaty gyzykly.
And for good reason.	We gaty gowy sebäp bilen.
This is nothing new.	Bu täze zat däl.
Looks like another life.	Başga bir durmuş ýaly bolup görünýär.

This is nothing.	Bu hiç hili zat däl.
Then he came home.	Soň bolsa öýüne geldi.
He was not ready for them tomorrow.	Ertir olar üçin taýyn däldi.
With this man.	Bu adam bilen.
.	.
It took a while to see it.	Muny görmek üçin biraz wagt gerek boldy.

And then it was there.	Soň bolsa şol ýerde boldy.
We have two this year.	Bu ýyl ikimiz bar.
She is still well.	Ol henizem gowy galdy.
The last time it was better.	Iň soňky gezek has gowy boldy.
I never knew it.	Men muny hiç haçan bilmeýärdim.
That night	Şol gije.
Someone has to be there to worry.	Kimdir biri alada edip, şol ýerde bolmaly.
It is not right to talk about these things.	Bu zatlar hakda gürleşmek dogry däl.
So it is impossible to say what he is doing.	Şonuň üçin näme edýändigini aýtmak mümkin däl.
My last confession.	Iň soňky boýun aldym.
Always very fast.	Elmydama gaty çalt.
He started to go crazy.	Ol däli bolup başlady.
The next issue.	Mesele indiki.
You don't have to.	Şeýle hem etmeli däl.
We are not close.	Biz ýakyn däl.
Nothing else will happen to him.	Onuň bilen başga hiç zat bolmaz.
It was good with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy boldy.
It was too much.	Ol gaty köp boldy.
It always looks so beautiful.	Elmydama şeýle owadan görünýär.
I have to give something	Men bir zat bermeli
The answer is probably no.	Jogap, belki ýok.
Definitely not the last.	Elbetde iň soňky däl.
Only at night.	Diňe gije.
He did not say that.	Ol muny aýtmady.
It was just like the last time.	Edil soňky gezek ýalydy.
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
This is not an interesting night for anyone.	Bu hiç kim üçin gyzykly gije däl.
Very cool stuff.	Gaty ajaýyp zatlar.
Aren't you against me?	Sen maňa garşy dälmi?
This is really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
Things that happen.	Bolýan zatlar.
The time has come.	Wagt ýakyn wagtda geldi.
I think it looks better.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu has gowy görünýär.
In fact, it is the other way around.	Aslynda bu başga ýol.
Maybe have fun.	Belki hezil et.
I thought it was good.	Gowy diýip pikir etdim.
I did not have.	Mende ýokdy.
Work is calling me.	Iş maňa jaň edýär.
Of course he has.	Elbetde, ol bar.
This is a meal for a few people.	Bu birnäçe adam üçin nahar.
In short.	Gysga.
We are alone here.	Biz bu ýerde ýeke.
It will never happen.	Bu asla bolmaz.
He did not hope.	Ol umyt etmedi.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
What can anyone say?	Her kim näme aýdyp biler?
He said he would.	Boljakdygyny aýtdy.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
A few months is nothing.	Birnäçe aý hiç zat däl.

There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
I'm new here	Men bu ýerde täze
Of course he knew that.	Elbetde, muny bilýärdi.
A man like him was never ready.	Onuň ýaly adam hiç wagt düýbünden taýyn däldi.
This is not just a job for him.	Bu onuň üçin diňe bir iş däl.
All day and all night.	Bütin gün we agşam.
I do not agree with that.	Men muňa razy däl.
I never thought it would be so hard.	Munuň gaty kyn boljakdygyny hiç wagt pikir etmedim.
I have no such worries.	Mende beýle alada ýok.
That sounds very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly ýaly.
I can be two.	Men iki bolup bilerin.
The most necessary time.	Iň zerur wagty.
This is often not the case.	Köplenç beýle däl.
It will do the same.	Bu hem edil şonuň ýaly eder.
He knew these things.	Bu zatlary bilýärdi.

This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
He didn't need it.	Oňa mätäç däldi.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
They would be there.	Olar şol ýerde bolardy.
This is more serious.	Bu has çynlakaý.
These three people were not necessarily.	Bu üç adam hökman däldi.
I have to go.	Men gitmeli.
It was fast.	Bu çalt boldy.
He has already said a lot.	Ol eýýäm gaty köp zat aýtdy.
I think he's still somewhere.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol henizem bir ýerde.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
It is impossible to say.	Muny aýtmak mümkin däl.
Not a bad thing.	Erbet zat däl.
Of course he didn't, I can't even answer.	Elbetde pikir etmedi, hatda jogap berip bilemok.
It wasn't much.	Bu kän däldi.
This problem can be really difficult.	Bu kynçylyk hakykatdanam kyn bolup biler.
He is not.	Ol ýok.
He could not see her.	Ol ony görüp bilmedi.
There is no such thing here.	Bu ýerde beýle zat ýok.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolardy.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
I already told you.	Size eýýäm aýtdym.
He did at that time.	Şol wagt etdi.
Similarly, he asked for more money.	Edil şonuň ýaly, has köp pul sorady.
What happened.	Näme boldy.
This is not good for you or them.	Bu siziň ýa-da olar üçin gowy däl.
This is a good thing.	Bu bir gowy zat.
It wasn't too bad.	Bu gaty erbet däldi.
There is still a lot of work to be done.	Entek gaty köp iş bar.
That would be a great help to them.	Bu olar üçin uly kömek bolardy.
He hoped it would not happen.	Ol beýle bolmaz diýip umyt etdi.
He will do it.	Ol muny eder.
I can't see anything	Bir zady görüp bilemok
I want to talk to them.	Men olar bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
It was even better last year.	Geçen ýyl has gowy boldy.
This is for him.	Bu onuň üçin.
Smart and smart.	Akylly we akylly.
This should not be enough for you.	Bu siziň üçin ýeterlik däl bolmaly.
I couldn't tell him anymore.	Men oňa indi aýdyp bilmedim.
Neither did he.	Şeýle hem etmedi.
It wasn't very good.	Gaty gowy däldi.
I wasn't really like that.	Men aslynda beýle däldim.
There.	Ol ýerde.
Probably never.	Mümkin, hiç haçan edip bilmedi.
How long should we be?	Biz näçe wagt bolmaly.
He will.	Ol eder.
Always, for everything.	Elmydama, hemme zat üçin.

They are not ready yet.	Olar entek taýyn däl.
I often think about it.	Men köplenç bu hakda pikir edýärin.
I am a lot of people	Men köp adam
I shouldn’t have let him make me crazy.	Meni däli etmegine ýol bermeli däldim.
Today and tomorrow are two such days.	Bu gün we ertir şeýle iki gün.
Maybe it would have been better then to have him.	Muny oňa alyp gitmek, belki şol wagt gowy bolardy.
I can't be with you	Men seniň bilen bolup bilemok
He never said much.	Ol hiç wagt kän zat aýtmady.
That was not always the case.	Ol hemişe beýle däldi.
They are many.	Olar köp.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
It's been a long year.	Uzak ýyl boldy.
This may seem like a long time.	Bu uzak wagt ýaly bolup biler.
Three years.	Üç ýyl.
He doesn't seem to mind.	Oňa garşy däl ýaly.
A maximum of two days.	Iň köp iki gün.
He could be himself.	Ol özi bolup biler.
He did not call police.	Ol polisiýa jaň etmedi.
He did a great job for us.	Ol biziň üçin gaty gowy iş etdi.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
Only you and me.	Diňe sen we men.
I am the only one here.	Men bu ýerde ýekeje adam.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Of course, this is often not the case.	Elbetde, köplenç beýle bolmaz.

He can get it very well, too.	Ony hem gaty gowy alyp biler.
It bothered me a lot.	Ol meni köp biynjalyk etdi.
That person is missing.	Ol adam ýok.

I thought we might need it.	Bize gerek bolup biler öýdüpdim.
So they are here.	Şonuň üçin olar şu ýerde.

Loans are bad for you.	Karz siziň üçin erbet.

Now he is gone.	Indi ol gitdi.

Who doesn't have time.	Kimiň wagty ýok.
He is new here.	Ol bu ýerde täze.
Maybe that will be enough.	Belki, bu ýeterlik bolar.

This is just an idea.	Bu diňe bir pikir.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
He began to speak.	Ol gürläp başlady.
Everything was very fast.	Hemme zat gaty çalt boldy.
Maybe it will be better in the morning.	Belki, irden has gowy bolar.
If anyone can answer you.	Kimdir biri size jogap berip biljek bolsa.
I did a lot.	Men köp zat etdim.
Good to see.	Görmek gowy.

He can't take you.	Ol seni alyp bilmez.
It looks better.	Bu has gowy görünýär.
Things have been great for a while.	Birnäçe wagt bäri zatlar gaty gowy.
I'm afraid of that.	Men bu barada gorkýaryn.
This can happen in two ways.	Bu iki ýol bilen bolup biler.
Maybe the same thing would happen now.	Belki, häzir edil şol bir zat bolardy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu, hiç hili sorag ýok.

Only these two.	Diňe şu ikisi.
There is no problem with them.	Olar bilen hiç hili mesele ýok.

It's not that far.	Bu beýle uzak däl.
Now it could happen to me again.	Indi maňa ýene bolup biler.

It can't be right.	Dogry bolup bilmez.
The same is true.	Bu hem edil şonuň ýaly.
In my opinion, this money should never have been borrowed.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu pul hiç wagt karz almaly däldi.

So there are two possibilities.	Şonuň üçin iki mümkinçilik bar.
Things are different here.	Bu ýerde zatlar başga.

It may take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek bolup biler.
You know, always good news.	Bilýärsiň, bu hemişe gowy habar.

It was time.	Bu wagt boldy.
He is himself.	Ol özi.
Who else could it be.	Başga kim bolup biler.
I admire that.	Men muňa haýran.
So it may take some time.	Şonuň üçin biraz wagt bolup biler.
It's too much.	Gaty köp bolýar.
He wants a new life.	Täze durmuş isleýär.
So there is only sound.	Şonuň üçin diňe ses bar.

Another one, then another.	Başga biri, soň başga biri.
I think it turned out really well.	Hakykatdanam gowy çykdy diýip pikir edýärin.
The man is beautiful.	Adam owadan.
Of course, he was not there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde ýokdy.
This seems impossible.	Bu mümkin däl ýaly.
The offer is good.	Teklip gowy.
I just need someone to talk to.	Maňa diňe gürleşmek üçin kimdir biri gerek.
And then it's not like that.	Soň bolsa beýle däl.
This time it is not.	Bu gezek beýle däl.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Sizi biynjalyk etmek islemedim.
Nothing for me.	Meniň üçin hiç zat ýok.

I don't know about that.	Men bu barada bilemok.
Really, you have to go now.	Hakykatdanam, indi gitmeli.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
You don't always have to talk.	Elmydama gürleşmek hökman däl.
That night and then.	Şol gije we soň.
Good.	Gowy.
I am happy for them.	Men olar üçin bagtly.
It's like work now.	Häzir iş ýaly.
He had to do something about it.	Ol bu barada bir zat etmeli bolardy.
That's why he called me.	Ine, maňa jaň etmegine sebäp boldy.
I saw it.	Men ony gördüm.
Two this week.	Şu hepde iki.
You are with me	Sen meniň bilen
This is not an offer.	Bu teklip däl.

It never happened.	Hiç haçan ýokdy.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.

Not just with him.	Diňe onuň bilen däl.
Maybe right away.	Belki derrew.
He knew what was going on there.	Ol ýerde näme bardygyny bilýärdi.
No one spoke.	Hiç kim söz aýtmady.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
He could only go once or twice.	Ol diňe bir ýa-da iki gezek baryp bilýärdi.
In fact, it is very beautiful.	Aslynda bu gaty owadan.
I have to agree with him.	Men onuň bilen razy bolmaly.

It's been two days.	Iki gün boldy.
He didn't give me anything.	Ol maňa hiç zat bermedi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu dogry sorag.
It must be a lot of fun.	Gaty hezil bolmaly.
It's three o'clock.	Sagat üç boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, häzir şeýle pikir edýär.
The song is really great.	Aýdym hakykatdanam ajaýyp.

Of course, this cannot be a lie.	Elbetde, bu ýalan bolup bilmez.

We need it.	Bize zerur.
It's bad, it's bad.	Ol erbet, gaty erbet.

Nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýok.
The damage was great.	Zyýan gaty uly boldy.
He is not smart.	Ol akylly däl.

You have to pay attention.	Üns bermeli.
A little good.	Biraz gowy.

It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
I was alone.	Men ýeke-täk boldum.

I am not.	Men beýle däl.
Everyone got the money.	Hemmeler pul aldy.
There is no clock for him.	Onuň üçin sagat ýok.
Today was not the day.	Bu gün ol gün däldi.
And then he told me one day.	Soň bolsa maňa bir gün aýtdy.

Of course not.	Elbetde beýle bolmaz.
I don't want to hurt you.	Men size zyýan bermek islämok.

Life should be easy.	Durmuş aňsat bolmaly.
I don't really know.	Aslynda bilemok.

He knew that too.	Ol hem muny bilýärdi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
He could not help himself.	Ol özüne kömek edip bilmedi.
He knew nothing about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat bilmeýärdi.
They are very close.	Olar gaty ýakyn.
I'm thinking of you!	Men sen hakda pikir edýärin!
I saw it.	Men ony gördüm.
He didn't need anything.	Oňa hiç zat gerek däldi.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
I beg your pardon.	Men muňa gaty haýyş edýärin.
Neither way can.	Iki ýol hem bolup bilmez.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
Today is another day.	Bu gün başga gün.
I had nothing.	Mende hiç zat ýokdy.
Of course he couldn't.	Elbetde, edip bilmedi.
This can really happen.	Bu hakykatdanam bolup biler.
You can also get it.	Şeýle hem alyp bilersiňiz.
I'm still different.	Men henizem başga.
She had a lot of fun.	Ol gaty hezil etdi.
This is just for me.	Bu diňe meniň üçin.

In the morning he left.	Irden ol gitdi.

He is very.	Ol gaty.
Aren't they beautiful?	Olar owadan dälmi?
I think it's good.	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
One year it was two, then three.	Bir ýyl iki, soň üç boldy.
This is not the case either.	Bu hem däl.
One day I long for it.	Bir gün gaty isleýärin.
This is really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet.
Everyone helped.	Hemmeler kömek etdi.
It can never happen.	Ol hiç haçan bolup bilmez.
This is for them.	Bu olar üçin.
He was there.	Ol bardy.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
Life has never been easier.	Durmuş hiç haçan aňsat däldi.
Then there was the girl.	Soň gyz bardy.
I have a lot to do.	Meniň etmeli köp zadym bar.
There was no answer to that.	Munuň üçin jogap ýokdy.
There was a reason for that.	Munuň bir sebäbi bardy.
I think you should probably give him a few words.	Meniň pikirimçe, belki, oňa birnäçe söz bermeli.
He said something very good.	Gaty gowy zat diýdi.
He realized that this would be the biggest problem.	Iň uly mesele boljakdygyna düşündi.
He didn't even want to talk to her.	Hatda onuň bilen gürleşmek islemedi.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
This is no longer interesting.	Bu indi gyzykly däl.
Actually two hours.	Aslynda iki sagat.
Everyone seems happy enough.	Her kim ýeterlik bagtly görünýär.
I am a good person.	Men gowy adam.
I can't think right now.	Men şu wagt pikir edip bilemok.
Man, you know that.	Adam, sen muny bilýärsiň.
Maybe this is true.	Belki munuň dogry bolmagy mümkin.
I, of course.	Men, elbetde.
I don’t think much about it.	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmeýärin.
I can't think of a better word.	Has gowy söz hakda pikir edip bilemok.
You know he can't.	Edip bilmeýändigini bilýärsiň.
I never thought it would happen.	Munuň boljakdygyny asla pikir etmedim.

He also has.	Ol hem bar.
There could be more.	Has köp zat bolup biler.
I hope this doesn't happen to me.	Bu meniň bilen bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
This is a very serious matter.	Bu gaty çynlakaý bir zat.
This is a really good thing.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy zat.
He did not vote.	Hiç zat ses bermedi.
He was not mad at me.	Ol maňa däli däldi.
Worst idea	Iň erbet pikir
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
This required a new departure.	Munuň üçin täze gitmek zerur boldy.
It's a really good thing.	Aslynda gaty gowy zat.
It has always been for me.	Ol hemişe meniň üçin boldy.
I thought this guy could do nothing wrong.	Bu ýigit hiç hili ýalňyşlyk edip bilmez öýdüpdim.
Everything was still there.	Hemme zat henizem bardy.
Of course there is a way.	Elbetde bir ýol bar.
It will be very bad.	Bu gaty erbet bolar.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.

No one is so smart.	Hiç kim beýle akylly däl.
You have to buy it seriously.	Çynlakaý satyn almaly.
And then he came back.	Soň bolsa gaýdyp geldi.
Everything has to go.	Hemme zat gitmeli.
He tells me this almost every day.	Ol maňa muny her gün diýen ýaly aýdýar.
It seemed good to be right.	Dogry bolmak gowy ýalydy.
He said he would think about it.	Ol bu barada pikir etjekdigini aýtdy.
I have a few answers.	Mende birnäçe jogap bar.
I can take it and I can be good with it.	Meni alyp bilerin we munuň bilen gowy bolup bilerin.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He didn't want you.	Ol seni islemedi.
I know enough to do that.	Muny etmäge ýeterlik bilýärin.
Maybe not enough.	Belki ýeterlik däl.
There is always someone.	Elmydama biri bar.
He had to go.	Ol gitmeli boldy.
That was good too.	Bu hem gowy boldy.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
The question is where and how.	Sorag nirede we nädip.
The sooner the better.	Näçe çalt bolsa gowy.
That would be really nice.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy bolardy.
That's all.	Bu hemme zat.
It looks beautiful.	Bu owadan görünýär.
I really enjoyed it.	Men hakykatdanam lezzet aldym.

Question about the future.	Geljek hakda sorag.
He has already confessed twice.	Ol eýýäm iki gezek boýun aldy.
It must be really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly bolmaly.
There are a lot of people there.	Ol ýerde köp adam.
He doesn't know.	Ol bilmeýär.
Me.	Ine.
What is this	Bu näme bolýar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň özi söz.
It's three o'clock in the morning.	Indi irden sagat üç boldy.
It's weird to see myself.	Özümi görmek gaty geň.
I did something today.	Şu gün bir zady etdim.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Munuň hökman bolmagy hökman däl.
He thought we could do better than that, of course.	Elbetde, mundan has gowy edip bileris diýip pikir etdi.
He stayed with her.	Ol onuň bilen galdy.
Of course there is.	Elbetde bar.
Then came the idea.	Soň bir pikir geldi.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
This is a great song.	Bu ajaýyp aýdym.

They are not happy.	Olar bagtly däl.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
Where can he be.	Ol nirede bolup biler.
I don't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmeýärin.
It was the best decision.	Iň gowy karar boldy.
He didn't think about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat pikir etmedi.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
No one can take that.	Muny hiç kim alyp bilmez.
This seemed unlikely.	Bu, gaty ähtimal däl ýaly boldy.
This word is certainly not new.	Bu söz elbetde täze däl.
Really crazy, really cool.	Hakykatdanam däli, hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
I'm not against it.	Men muňa garşy däl.

A week ago.	Bir hepde öň.
Okay, it looks good.	Bolýar, gowy görünýär.

It was a good night.	Gowy gije boldy.
He destroyed it for them.	Ol muny olar üçin ýok etdi.
He never knew what had caused him.	Oňa näme sebäp bolandygyny hiç wagt bilmeýärdi.
What a wonderful guy.	Nähili ajaýyp ýigit.
You are not there	Sen ol ýerde däl
Oh, they're here.	Aý, olar şu ýerde.
He didn't care about anything else.	Başga bir zat hakda alada etmedi.
He was crazy.	Ol däli boldy.
Okay, well, very good.	Bolýar, gowy, gaty gowy.
It was yesterday and today.	Bu düýn boldy we şu gün.

It was good.	Gowy boldy.
It should also be bad.	Şeýle hem erbet bolmaly.
Not yet.	Entek ýok.
He never did.	Ol hiç haçan edip bilmedi.
This is for me.	Bu meniň üçin.
Not bad, not bad at all.	Erbet däl, asla erbet däl.
No one else paid attention.	Başga hiç kim üns bermedi.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
He could do whatever he wanted.	Islän zadyny edip bilýärdi.
This is a really difficult issue.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn mesele.
They are.	Olar.
She doesn't care.	Oňa alada ýok.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu ýok.
I did not have.	Mende ýokdy.
It looks great on me.	Maňa gaty gowy görünýär.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
Because you are not ours.	Sebäbi sen biziň däl.
It's two o'clock.	Sagat iki boldy.
I didn't see myself that way.	Özümi beýle görmedim.
This was not good news.	Bu gowy habar däldi.

They are human too.	Olar hem adam.
I was very good at it.	Men muňa gaty gowy boldum.

The question is here.	Sorag şu ýerde.
Life will be fun.	Durmuş gyzykly bolar.
He will have a lot of fun.	Ol gaty hezil eder.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
I'm very good at it.	Men muňa gaty gowy.
It looks great.	Gaty gowy görünýär.
He did not want to answer.	Ol jogap bermek islemedi.
He said it was not.	Ol beýle däldigini aýtdy.
It was not with him.	Bu onuň bilen däldi.
.	.
I didn't think so.	Men muňa pikir etmedim.
This is not difficult.	Bu kyn däl.
A little, to tell the truth.	Biraz, hakykaty aýtmak üçin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şonuň ýaly.

You have nothing	Sen hiç zat ýok
This is a strange time.	Bu geň wagt.
Bigger for something.	Bir zat üçin has uly.
It will be fast and easy.	Çalt we aňsat bolar.
He could not control himself anymore.	Ol indi özüni alyp bilmedi.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
This was not for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin däldi.
This is not good or bad.	Munuň özi gowy ýa-da erbet däl.
A few years ago.	Birnäçe ýyl mundan ozal.
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
He fell asleep again.	Ol ýene uklap galdy.
He has now admitted this.	Ol muny indi boýun aldy.
In your opinion, to find out.	Muny bilmek üçin siziň pikiriňizçe.
I want a word with you	Siziň bilen bir söz isleýärin
It could be a beautiful thing.	Bu owadan zat bolup biler.

Really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy.
Of course you have to go.	Elbetde, gitmeli.
I just want to say.	Diňe aýtmak isleýärin.

Nothing can happen.	Hiç zat bolup bilmez.
I'm not ready for the party.	Men oturylyşyga taýyn däl.
I couldn't help it.	Men oňa kömek edip bilmedim.
Why now?	Näme üçin indi?
You have to do well.	Gowy etmeli.
Why is that possible?	Näme üçin beýle bolup biler?
You have to do it now.	Muny indi etmeli.
He couldn't get one.	Ol birini alyp bilmedi.
It's too early.	Bu entek ir.
Not just me, everyone.	Diňe men däl, hemmeler.
Several times.	Birnäçe gezek.
He said it was not possible.	Ol munuň mümkin däldigini aýtdy.
He knows everything about you.	Ol sen hakda hemme zady bilýär.
No one seems to know what happened.	Näme bolandygyny hiç kim bilenok ýaly.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili erbet zat ýok.
That's all.	Diňe şol.
This is a great time.	Bu gaty uly wagt.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
No news, bad news.	Habar ýok, erbet habar.
Seriously this time.	Bu gezek çynlakaý.
There was nothing else I could do.	Başga edip biljek başga zady ýokdy.
He took it somewhere.	Bir ýere alyp gitdi.
I need something to go.	Gitmek üçin bir zat gerek.
He asked about it a while ago.	Ol bu barada birneme öň sorady.
He did not make such a request.	Ol beýle haýyş etmedi.
The worst.	Iň erbet.
It was great for me.	Meniň üçin bu gaty gowy boldy.
There was little hope.	Umyt kän däldi.
There is nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýok.
Great to see.	Görmek gaty gowy.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
This is a great offer for many.	Köp adam üçin bu ajaýyp teklip.
I don't know what caused it.	Muňa näme sebäp bolandygyny bilemok.
This is difficult.	Bu kyn.
It would be wise to do that.	Muny etmek akylly bolardy.
It will be very difficult for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty kyn bolar.
Good news.	Gowy habar.
I don't think he wants to go home.	Öýüne gitmek isleýär öýdemok.
Very, very, very! 	Gaty, gaty, gaty!

He decided.	Ol karar berdi.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
That's all there is to it.	Diňe şu bar.
It can happen and it can happen now.	Bu bolup biler we indi bolup biler.
It was very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly boldy.

The night is coming.	Gije gelýär.

Not immediately.	Derrew däl.
That was no big deal.	Bu ajaýyp söz däldi.
I'm not good	Men gowy däl
I just want to be alone.	Men diňe ýeke bolmak isleýärin.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.

It's actually kind of beautiful.	Aslynda bir hili owadan.
In fact, he is.	Aslynda ol şol.
It's really beautiful.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty owadan.
No one had to answer.	Hiç kim jogap bermeli däldi.
Bar bar.	Bar bar.
Another time.	Başga wagt.
He does.	Ol şeýle edýär.

Go for it.	Munuň üçin gitmek.
They are not like us.	Olar biziň ýaly däl.
He did well.	Gowy etdi.
That's great.	Munuň özi gaty gowy.
It's too late.	Gijä galdy.
I really want to know more about you.	Men hakykatdanam sen hakda has köp bilmek isleýärin.
This is not an idea.	Bu pikir däl.
And then something happens.	Soň bolsa bir zat bolýar.
Too far.	Gaty uzak.

He does so well.	Ol şeýle gowy edýär.

She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.

New error.	Täze ýalňyşlyk.
No work.	Iş ýok.
I'll take care of that.	Men muňa alada ederin.
He had to do something about it.	Ol bu barada bir zat etmeli boldy.
I need them.	Olar maňa gerek.
He could not go any further.	Ol mundan uzak gidip bilmedi.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
He didn't pay attention.	Oňa üns bermedi.
Of course, there are many ways.	Elbetde, gaty köp ýol bar.
Not for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin däl.
That's big enough.	Bu ýeterlik uly.
This is another way.	Bu başga ýol.
His stuff is great.	Onuň zatlary gaty gowy.
That would be it.	Ine, şeýle bolardy.
Then came the idea.	Soň bir pikir geldi.
I got permission from him.	Men onuň bilen rugsat aldym.
This is often not necessary.	Bu köplenç zerur däl.
He may already be there.	Ol eýýäm şol ýerde bolmagy mümkin.
Also.	Şeýle hem.
I couldn't do it anymore	Men indi edip bilmedim
Of course you have to be crazy.	Elbetde, däli bolmaly.
He thought it would happen.	Boljakdygyny pikir etdi.
Then came the call.	Soň bolsa jaň geldi.
There was no reason, but he did.	Sebäbi ýokdy, ýöne etdi.
I know, great.	Bilýärin, ajaýyp.
What can we say?	Näme aýdyp bileris?
This is too big for us.	Bu biziň üçin gaty uly.
Maybe a face.	Belki ýüz bolup biler.
Not always.	Elmydama ýok.
He didn't have to.	Ol hökman däldi.
It helped.	Bu kömek etdi.
Three people.	Üç adam.
He also asked me a question.	Şeýle hem, ol maňa sorag berdi.
It's money, money, money.	Bu pul, pul, pul.
I want to see you there!	Men sizi ol ýerde görmek isleýärin!
It's really like life.	Hakykatdanam durmuş ýaly.
That would be a problem.	Mesele bolardy.
Today	Bu gün.
It was almost.	Bu diýen ýalydy.
A few days.	Birnäçe gün.
Maybe just crazy.	Belki diňe däli.
Good and bad things.	Gowy we erbet zatlar.
The same is true for us.	Biziň üçin hem edil şonuň ýaly.
I never mind.	Hiç wagt muňa garşy däl.
He always did.	Elmydama etdi.
Even.	Hatda.
Two years, even.	Iki ýyl, hatda.
He will return to work there.	Ol şol ýere işe gaýdyp geler.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
It could be that.	Ol hem bolup biler.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
I still think.	Men henizem pikir edýärin.
I had.	Mende bardy.
No one can do that.	Hiç kim muny edip bilmez.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
You are the most beautiful	Sen iň owadan.
It's not bad at all and it's not good.	Bu düýbünden erbet däl we gowy däl.
Everyone will think it's weird.	Her kim muny etmek geň zat diýip pikir eder.
He did not harm himself.	Ol özüne zyýan bermedi.
I think a lot.	Men köp pikir edýärin.
This is no longer the case.	Bu indi beýle däl.
I saw a girl here.	Men şu ýerde bir gyz gördüm.
All the way	Bütin ýol.
No one called me.	Hiç kim maňa jaň etmedi.
It's a job for them.	Olar üçin bu bir iş.
Just for him.	Diňe onuň üçin.
They are also very good.	Olar hem gaty gowy.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	Şol wagt gowy pikir ýalydy.
They are for you and me.	Olar seniň we meniň üçin.
Myself, myself, myself was very good.	Özüm, özüm, özüm gaty gowy boldum.
Good job	Gowy iş.
He was late.	Ol gijä galdy.
And then he came.	Soň bolsa geldi.
Maybe you can make it really short.	Belki, hakykatdanam gysga edip bilersiňiz.
He gave it to me.	Ol muny maňa berdi.
He really is.	Ol hakykatdanam.
You have to think very badly about it.	Ol hakda gaty erbet pikir etmeli.
I was worried about that.	Men bu barada alada etdim.
And then it happens.	Soň bolsa şeýle bolýar.
A word and no more.	Bir söz we indi ýok.
Nothing, because nothing.	Hiç zat ýok, sebäbi hiç zat ýok.
No sound.	Ses ýok.
I'm a little skeptical.	Men muňa birneme şübhelenýärin.
He knew nothing.	Ol hiç zady bilmeýärdi.
The moon has risen.	Aý çykdy.
I think about them every day.	Men olar hakda her gün pikir edýärin.
This is not easy at all.	Bu asla aňsat däl.
You are here for him.	Sen onuň üçin şu ýerde.
Good news.	Gowy habar.
In fact, almost always.	Aslynda hemişe diýen ýaly.
It should also be short.	Şeýle hem gysga bolmaly.
He doesn't need it.	Oňa mätäç däl.
There is no other way.	Elmydama başga ýol däl.
What fun.	Nähili hezil.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe birnäçe zat etmeli.
I lent	Men karz berdim
That's a lot.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty köp zat.
He wants it everywhere.	Ol hemme ýerde isleýär.
I'm not good at all.	Men asla gowy däl.
He asked me about it several times.	Ol menden ol hakda birnäçe gezek sorady.
You need it now.	Size indi gerek.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
This is not a big deal for most people.	Köp adam üçin bu uly bir mesele däl.
Everything should be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolmaly.
He understood that now.	Ol muňa indi düşündi.
It's time.	Bu sagat.
It won't happen.	Ol bolmaz.
I don't like it at all	Men asla halamok
Now.	Indi.
Talk to someone.	Biri bilen gürleşmek.
Now that's right.	Indi dogry.
It can't be that happy next time.	Indiki gezek beýle bagtly bolup bilmez.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
Neither did he.	Şeýle hem etmedi.
It was not against us.	Bu bize garşy däldi.
You are the best!	Sen iň gowy!.
What a bad idea.	Nähili erbet pikir.
There was something else, too.	Şeýle hem, başga bir zady bardy.
Right here.	Edil şu ýerde.
They both started.	Ikisi-de başlady.
I'm sure this will be interesting too.	Munuň hem gyzykly boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
He did something.	Bir zat etdi.
He was busy.	Ol özüni meşgul etdi.
I really care.	Men hakykatdanam alada edýärin.
It was good for them.	Bu olar üçin gowy boldy.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I thought.	Men pikir etdim.
I'm not against you.	Men saňa garşy däl.
He did one day.	Bir gün etdi.
I even bought it.	Men hatda satyn aldym.
There is no shortcut here.	Bu ýerde gysga ýol ýok.
No one bothered anyone.	Hiç kim hiç kimi biynjalyk etmedi.
I am here.	Men şu ýerde.
And now it's time.	Indi bolsa geldi.
Something with that.	Munuň bilen bir zat.
He doesn't want to go home with me.	Ol meniň bilen öýe gitmek islemeýär.
You are very smart.	Sen gaty akylly.
Please. "	Haýyş edýärin "diýdi.
It's you and me.	Bu sen we men.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty ajaýyp.
That could be good.	Bu gowy bolup biler.
One message.	Biri habar.
I think that's really a lot.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hakykatdanam köp zat.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
He apologized.	Ol ötünç sorady.
He could have loved her so much.	Ony gaty gowy görüp bilýärdi.
Here it is.	Ine, indi.
It was really good twice.	Iki gezek hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
He did what he did for me just for you.	Ol meniň üçin edenini edil seniň üçin etdi.
He did nothing.	Ol hiç zat etmedi.
Adult.	Uly adam.
He had nothing of his own.	Onuň özüne hiç zady ýokdy.
Of course there is.	Elbetde, bar.
It can be fun.	Gyzykly bolup biler.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
There is a problem.	Mesele bar.
He needs work.	Oňa iş gerek.
Because that's not enough.	Sebäbi bu ýeterlik däl.
There are two people.	Iki adam bar.
It looks new.	Ol täze görünýär.
What he saw troubled him.	Gören zatlary ony biynjalyk etdi.
We can get him something else.	Biz oňa başga bir zat alyp bileris.
I think it would be a good idea.	Gowy pikir bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
Then he wanted to see me again.	Soň bolsa meni ýene görmek isledi.
Really	Hakykatdanam.
He will just do it.	Ol diňe eder.
He had to do something and it was fast.	Ol bir zat etmeli boldy we çalt.
No one.	Hiç kim däldi.
This time he was right.	Bu gezek ony dogry aýtdy.
Beautiful, very beautiful.	Owadan, gaty owadan.
It was no longer fun.	Indi beýle hezil däldi.
Just for fun.	Diňe hezil üçin.
He came.	Ol geldi.
Going to work every day makes me happy.	Her gün işe gitmek meni bagtly edýär.
We are there tonight.	Şu gün agşam biz şol ýerde.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
Really serious.	Hakykatdanam çynlakaý.
He could not help it.	Ol kömek edip bilmedi.
It's easy.	Bu aňsat.
A long week.	Uzak bir hepde.
Such a wonderful day	Şeýle ajaýyp gün.
Now everyone is against me.	Indi hemmeler maňa garşy.
This is what I want.	Bu meniň isleýän zadym.
Seeing, of course.	Görmek, elbetde.
It takes a lot of work.	Köp iş gerek.
This is not a thing.	Bu bir zat däl.
That could be a big deal.	Bu uly mesele bolup biler.
He was with her this morning.	Karar bilen şu gün irden onuň bilen boldy.
No one offered to help her.	Hiç kim oňa kömek etmegi teklip etmedi.
It was for them.	Bu olar üçin boldy.
Now everyone asked.	Indi hemmeler sorady.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu düýbünden dogry däl.
There are two reasons for this.	Munuň iki sebäbi bar.
Every now and then.	Her gezek we derrew.
Good answer.	Gowy jogap.
Very good now.	Häzir gaty gowy.
There were two possibilities.	Iki mümkinçilik bardy.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
.	.
Maybe you can help.	Belki kömek edip bilersiňiz.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
I never knew it could be so good.	Munuň beýle gowy bolup biljekdigini hiç wagt bilmeýärdim.
This is better.	Bu has gowy.
This is a difficult thing to do.	Bu etmek kyn zat.
This can take several hours.	Bu birnäçe sagat alyp biler.
I decided.	Men karar berdim.
He took me away.	Meni alyp gitdi.
It could not be.	Ol bolup bilmedi.
You can only decide.	Diňe karar berip bilersiňiz.
It could be more.	Ol has köp bolup biler.
This is really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty kyn.
Maybe he knows.	Belki bilýän bolsa gerek.
You have no choice.	Size başga ýol ýok.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
It's about you.	Bu sen hakda.
He did.	Etdi.
I don't need it.	Maňa gerek däl.
This could not have been worse.	Bu erbet bir zat bolup bilmedi.
I'm weird.	Men geň ýaly.
Good.	Gowy.
Not there.	Ol ýerde däl.
I gave it to him.	Men oňa berdim.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe boýun bolmaly.
He wants it.	Ol muny isleýär.
That should never have happened.	Bu hiç wagt beýle bolmaly däldi.
In fact, nothing.	Aslynda hiç zat ýok.
It was crazy.	Bu däli boldy.
In fact, the food is great.	Aslynda nahar gaty ajaýyp.
A short, good word.	Gysga, gowy söz.
He is never.	Ol hiç wagt däl.
Maybe it will be good.	Belki, ol gowy bolar.
He will do it three more times.	Muny ýene üç gezek eder.
That was the answer.	Bu jogap boldy.
It’s not like a job or something.	Bu bir iş ýa-da bir zat ýaly däl.
I am really new.	Men hakykatdanam täze.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Men saňa öňem aýtmak islemedim.
This, of course, is not a lie.	Bu, elbetde, ýalan däl.
You can see it.	Ony görüp bilersiňiz.
Of course, he was not there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde ýokdy.
This is possible.	Bu mümkin.
This is a big question.	Bu uly sorag.
This year has been an interesting one.	Bu ýyl gyzykly ýyl boldy.
Not for a reason.	Bir sebäp üçin däl.
How can I do that?	Muny nädip edip bilerin?
This is really good news.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy habar.
You have to stop it.	Ony hökman bes etmeli.
It was even better for him to do so.	Oňa hatda şeýle etmek hem gowy boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu birneme mesele.
Don't go for less that your full potential.	Uzak gitmeli däl.
Really here.	Hakykatdanam şu ýerde.
He wanted to be with her.	Onuň bilen bile bolmak isledi.
Not at all, it will only bother you.	Asla beýle däl, bu diňe sizi biynjalyk eder.
It's over now.	Indi boldy.
Nothing is right for me yet.	Meniň üçin entek hiç zat dogry däl.
There was no time for that.	Munuň üçin wagt ýokdy.
I am happy now.	Men häzir bagtly.
Maybe I thought.	Belki pikir etdim.
This is a new opportunity.	Bu täze bir mümkinçilik.
He was never right.	Ol hiç haçan dogry däldi.
Arrived.	Geldi.
It gets better.	Has gowy bolýar.
Of course there is.	Elbetde, biri bar.
Isn't that fun?!.	Bu hezil ýaly dälmi?!.
I thought it was great.	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim.
He does so well.	Ol şeýle gowy edýär.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, beýle däl.
I thought about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etdim.
Everyone is ready to go.	Hemmeler gitmäge taýyn.
He was not there at all.	Ol düýbünden ýokdy.
He did what he did because he did.	Ol edenini etdi, sebäbi etdi.
He hoped.	Umyt etdi.
Long time no see	Köp wagt.
He gave someone else this morning.	Ol şu gün irden başga birini berdi.
That is what happened.	Şeýle zatlar boldy.
He told me everything.	Ol maňa hemme zady aýtdy.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
You know what it was like.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilýärsiň.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
She is at home.	Ol öýde.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, biz etmeli.
I still think.	Men henizem pikir edýärin.
He thought he was an easy man.	Aňsat adam diýip pikir etdi.
Said the good girl.	Gowy gyz diýdi.
She was no longer beautiful.	Ol indi owadan däldi.
He also came back here.	Ol hem bu ýere gaýdyp geldi.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I have no choice.	Mende başga ýol ýok.
Now he is gone.	Indi ol gitdi.
He was next.	Ol indiki boldy.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
Then came another thought.	Soň oňa başga bir pikir geldi.
I still don't want to give much.	Men entek kän bermek islämok.
Maybe it will help.	Belki kömek eder.
None, I think.	Hiç biri, meniň pikirimçe.
We can say that it exists.	Munuň bardygyny aýdyp bileris.
Is that so?	Bu şeýlemi?
All life	Bütin durmuş.
Every year has been difficult.	Her ýyl kyn boldy.
I want a hundred people.	Men ýüz adam isleýärin.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
This is good for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy.
Probably.	Mümkin, mümkin.
I called home.	Men öýe jaň etdim.
Answer.	Jogap.
I hope this will be good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
You are different	Sen başga.
There were two girls.	Iki gyz bardy.
He will do it.	Muny eder.
This is not good for a guy.	Bir ýigit üçin bu gowy däl.
It has not always been easy.	Elmydama beýle aňsat däldi.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
I do not believe this will ever happen.	Munuň hiç haçan boljakdygyna ynanamok.
That would be great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp bolardy.
It was new to me.	Bu meniň üçin täze boldy.
If there is one thing, there is another way.	Bir zat bar bolsa başga ýol.
He knew he didn't want to do that.	Ol muny islemeýändigini bilýärdi.
I never needed much rest.	Maňa hiç wagt kän dynç gerek däldi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He said no.	Ol ýok diýdi.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
He understood that.	Ol muňa düşündi.
Who can do that?	Muny kim edip biler?
He is still here.	Ol henizem şu ýerde.
I couldn't sleep last night.	Düýn gije uklap bilmedim.
He never does that twice.	Ol muny hiç haçan iki gezek etmeýär.
This is very interesting.	Bu bolsa gaty gyzykly.
So every thought is different.	Şonuň üçin her bir pikir başga.
Not once.	Bir gezek däl.
I always want to know more.	Elmydama has köp bilmek isleýärin.
Not just anyone.	Diňe hiç kim däl.
You have to tell me everything.	Hemmesini maňa aýtmaly.
He helps you.	Ol size kömek edýär.
That's what happens.	Ine, şeýle bolýar.
He had fun.	Ol hezil etdi.
He did nothing.	Ol hiç zat etmedi.
Maybe a few more.	Belki, ýene birnäçe.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle däl.
This is always possible for you.	Bu siziň üçin elmydama mümkin.
I'll have to tell you.	Men saňa aýtmaly bolaryn.
This is a long time.	Bu köp wagt.
So the good news is, the problem is elsewhere.	Şonuň üçin gowy habar, mesele başga ýerde.
That's a lot of work.	Bu gaty köp iş.
Of course he did.	Elbetde muny etdi.
It will be for you too.	Bu hem siziň üçin bolar.
She was not beautiful.	Ol owadan däldi.
Tonight	Şu gije.
Permitting was not easy for him.	Rugsat bermek onuň üçin aňsat däldi.
We need it.	Bu bize gerek.
This is not the only thing.	Bu ýöne bir zat däl.
I hope someone can help.	Kimdir biri kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
There was no sound.	Ses ýokdy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şonuň ýaly.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
Not very close, but close enough.	Gaty ýakyn däl, ýöne ýeterlik ýakyn.
Only.	Diňe.
And then he did it again.	Soň bolsa ýene etdi.
If this statement is true, then it is a lie.	Bu söz dogry bolsa, ýalan.
Everyone was there.	Hemmeler ol ýerde bardy.
Of course, this is not enough.	Elbetde, bu ýeterlik däl.
So there is no reason.	Şonuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
He did not decide.	Ol karar bermedi.
Nothing serious.	Çynlakaý zat ýok.
This is how it looks to me.	Bu maňa nähili görünýär.
No one can hurt me again.	Hiç kim maňa ýene zyýan berip bilmez.
Not even next month.	Geljek aý hem däl.
Tomorrow is tomorrow.	Ertir ertir.
I saw why he wanted it that way.	Näme üçin beýle isleýändigini gördüm.
I hope it never happens.	Hiç haçan bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
I gave it to him.	Men oňa berdim.
This is the hardest thing.	Bu iň kyn zat.
Another person every week.	Her hepde başga bir adam.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
This is not bad at all.	Bu asla erbet däl.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmeli däl.
Good thing you already have it.	Gowy zat, siz eýýäm gaty kyn.
I'm afraid of myself.	Men özüm diýip gorkýaryn.
A crazy man	Bir däli adam.
Maybe very close.	Belki gaty ýakyn.
Not now.	Häzir ýok.
This is a problem.	Bu bir mesele.
I almost got it.	Men diýen ýaly aldym.
He is with me.	Ol meniň bilen.
Almost every night	Her gije diýen ýaly.
He is here, there.	Ol şu ýerde, şol ýerde.
He thinks he knows.	Bilýändigini pikir edýär.
Sounds really good.	Çynlakaý gaty gowy ýaly.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki, polisiýa jaň eden bolsa gerek.
I think it's a big mistake.	Meniň pikirimçe uly ýalňyşlyk.
Only they or me.	Diňe olar ýa-da men.
Oh, so be it.	Aý, şeýle bolmaly.
It was good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy boldy.
For him and for you.	Onuň we seniň üçin.
This is good too.	Bu hem gowy.
You are good	Sen gowy.
This is a very good question.	Bu gaty gowy sorag.
No one should have been harmed.	Hiç kim zyýan bermeli däldi.
It's over.	Bu indi.
It comes with work.	Bu iş bilen gelýär.
I will do it	Men muny etjek
Is there a better way?	Has gowy ýol barmy?
And then he got it twice.	Soň bolsa iki gezek aldy.
They are very bad.	Olar gaty erbet.
Right there.	Edil şol ýerde.
There was another person who helped us.	Bize kömek eden başga bir adam bardy.
I'm not bad.	Men erbet däl.
That shouldn't be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däl.
Maybe not.	Belki beýle däl.
This will be next week.	Bu, indiki hepde bolar.
He was not like me.	Ol meniň ýaly däldi.
He will come back to you.	Ol size gaýdyp geler.
What is this	Bu näme bolýar.
It even makes us.	Bu bizi hatda edýär.
Crazy	Däli.
They are so beautiful.	Olar gaty ajaýyp.
He knew there was something wrong.	Ol bir zadyň bardygyny bilýärdi.
Of course not.	Elbetde, onuň eden zady däl.
Strange thing.	Has geň zat.
There will be a lot of people there.	Ol ýerde köp adam bolar.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
This is for me.	Meniň üçin bu.
I can go	Men gidip bilerin
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň üçin iň gowy zat.
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet iş.
We have to be smart.	Biz akylly bolmaly.
I am alone.	Men özüm ýeke.
It was great for me.	Bu meniň üçin ajaýyp boldy.
There are a lot of bad things.	Erbet zatlar kän.
I never knew.	Men hiç wagt bilmedim.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hili zat.
You can do more.	Has köp zatlary edip bilersiňiz.
He probably knows that.	Ol muny bilýän bolsa gerek.
Whoever this is.	Bu kim üçin bolsa.
I don't want to be in this house.	Men bu öýde bolmak islämok.
I couldn't think of anything else right now.	Häzirki wagtda başga zat hakda pikir edip bilmedim.
It looks better now.	Häzir has gowy görünýär.
He needs something.	Oňa bir zat gerek.
I have no money	Mende pul ýok
This is the best year for me.	Bu meniň üçin iň gowy ýyl.
The word came out.	Bu söz çykdy.
I should have known better.	Men has gowy bilýän bolmaly.
Smart, maybe, but not very smart.	Akylly, mümkin, ýöne gaty akylly däl.
I hope so.	Bolýar diýip umyt edýärin.
No one was hurt.	Hiç kim zyýan bermedi.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
He wanted to do it all night.	Ol muny bütin gije etmek isledi.
I agree with that.	Men muňa razy.
He doesn't want to know that.	Muny bilmek islemeýär.
He was not stupid and made no mistake.	Ol samsyk däl we hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedi.
I believe he can help us right away.	Derrew bize kömek edip biljekdigine ynanýaryn.
.	.
I didn't want to do that.	Men muny etmek islemedim.
It seems like I don't know.	Muny eýýäm bilmeýän ýaly.
He did a great job.	Uly iş etdi.
We can't do enough.	Biz ýeterlik edip bilmeris.
He is coming to you.	Ol size gelýär.
I just want to help.	Men diňe kömek etmek isleýärin.
What a difficult decision.	Bu nähili kyn karar.
You are still beautiful	Sen henizem owadan.
More questions, maybe.	Has köp sorag, belki.
They were not alone here.	Olar bu ýerde ýeke däldi.
He gave her an idea.	Oňa bir pikir berdi.
It doesn't exist at all.	Ol düýbünden ýok.
It should be a great evening.	Ajaýyp agşam bolmaly.
So it will be very interesting.	Şonuň üçin gaty gyzykly bolar.
You have to do something about it.	Bu hakda bir zat etmeli.
No words.	Söz ýok.
He arrested me.	Ol meni tussag etdi.
Here we will never agree.	Bu ýerde biz hiç haçan razy bolmaz.
I told her.	Men oňa aýtdym.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
Not everything or nothing right now.	Şu wagt hemme zat ýa-da hiç zat däl.
This is a wonderful word.	Bu ajaýyp söz.
Weekend	Dynç güni.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolýar.
It wasn't fun anymore.	Indi gyzykly däldi.
No one knew it.	Muny hiç kim bilmeýärdi.
How is that	Bu nähili?
We still have.	Biz henizem bar.
probably.	ähtimal.
Here is the reason.	Ine, sebäp.
It wasn't that bad before.	Ozal beýle erbet däldi.
It will take many years.	Munuň üçin köp ýyl gerek.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
Needless to say.	Muny aýtmaly däl.
Because it happened.	Sebäbi şeýle boldy.
That's a lot for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty köp.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
One thing for sure.	Elbetde, bir zat.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
It can never happen here.	Bu ýerde hiç wagt bolup bilmez.
I called, I called, there was no answer.	Men jaň etdim, jaň etdim, jogap ýok.
You really shouldn't do that.	Hakykatdanam, beýle zatlary etmeli däl.
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
Maybe not for a year.	Belki bir ýyl däl.
I was there.	Men ol ýerde boldum.
He could not say anything for himself.	Özi üçin bir zat aýdyp bilmedi.
There are two ways to do this.	Bu hakda iki ýol ýok.
He was not a man.	Bu adam däldi.
It was not his thing either.	Ol hem onuň zady däldi.
It's too late.	Munuň üçin gijä galdy.
And then do hard.	Soň bolsa gaty et.
The problem is, I don't know how.	Mesele, nädip bilenok.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
He did it right.	Dogry etdi.
This time it was better.	Bu gezek has gowy boldy.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
He does it several times.	Birnäçe gezek edýär.
Maybe not.	Belki bolmaz.
I can't think of anything to do.	Etjek zadym hakda pikir edip bilemok.
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolar.
I hope you enjoy the ride.	Seniň gitmek gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
I am better	Men has gowy
He calls me.	Ol maňa jaň edýär.
That's enough for him.	Bu onuň üçin ýeterlik.
We are almost ready.	Biz taýyn diýen ýaly.
It would be crazy for him.	Bu onuň üçin däli bolar.
Of course there was.	Elbetde, bardy.
To think that there is only so much.	Diňe köp zat bar diýip pikir etmek.
What a fool.	Nähili samsyk.
He knew there would be a reason.	Munuň bir sebäbi boljakdygyny bilýärdi.
I know that shouldn't be the case.	Beýle bolmaly däldigini bilýärin.
One or two.	Bir ýa-da iki.
This is a completely new challenge.	Bu düýbünden täze kynçylyk.
That's a lot.	Bu köp.
He just says he doesn't like you.	Diňe senden razy däldigini aýdýar.
Not too big.	Gaty uly däl.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Of course I was worried.	Elbetde alada etdim.
He did something else.	Başga bir zat hem etdi.
It can also be challenging and enjoyable.	Şeýle hem kynçylyk we lezzet berip biler.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
Now nothing was easy.	Indi hiç zat aňsat däldi.
I agree.	Men razy bolaryn.
Today is not the day.	Bu gün gün däl.
I can't get it	Men muny alyp bilemok
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
He hasn't seen it yet.	Ol entek görüp bilmedi.
I care a lot.	Men köp alada edýärin.
More seemed to be better.	Has köp zat has gowy ýalydy.
I was stupid, but there was.	Meni samsyk, ýöne bardy.
Take care of you	Siz hakda alada etmek.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Well, good for you	Gowy, siziň üçin gowy
I don't need anything else.	Maňa başga zat gerek däl.
I had to take that seriously.	Muňa çynlakaý üns bermeli boldum.
There is nothing against it.	Oňa garşy hiç zat ýok.
I care a lot.	Men gaty köp alada edýärin.
Just like you	Siz ýaly.
This is a really big deal.	Bu bir mesele hakykatdanam iki mesele.
I can't tell you.	Men saňa aýdyp biljek däl.
That's it.	Edil şu.
We are really happy.	Biz hakykatdanam bagtly.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
He needs something to talk about.	Oňa gürleşmek üçin bir zat gerek.
I think you just have to relax.	Meniň pikirimçe, diňe dynç almaly.
He wants more money.	Has köp pul isleýär.
That seemed right.	Bu dogry ýalydy.
I think he's really smart.	Meniň pikirimçe, hakykatdanam akylly.
Nothing can harm him.	Hiç zat oňa zyýan berip bilmez.
I already did.	Men eýýäm etdim.
Now we have both.	Indi ikimizem bar.
Why? 	Näme üçin?
I know this may not be easy for you.	Munuň siziň üçin aňsat bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärin.
He is still gone.	Ol henizem gitdi.
This is a difficult thing.	Bu kyn zat.
Here's what.	Ine näme.
We need everyone.	Bize her bir adam gerek.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman däl.
I thought it was good.	Gowy diýip pikir etdim.
Maybe you can tell me.	Belki, maňa aýdyp bilersiňiz.
What is right for you is not right for everyone.	Siziň üçin dogry zat hemmeler üçin dogry däl.
This is easy to answer.	Bu jogap bermek aňsat.
In fact, it is a mistake.	Aslynda ýalňyşlyk.
I have to give it to you.	Men muny saňa bermeli.
He said he did not know.	Bilmeýändigini aýtdy.
It was a full moon last night.	Düýn gije doly Aý boldy.
He called her.	Ol oňa jaň etdi.
Shouldn't this be something?	Bu hiç zat bolmaly dälmi?
You are not smart	Sen akylly däl
A new sound came out.	Täze ses çykdy.
You're just a girl.	Sen diňe gyz.
Of course, it was fun.	Elbetde, şol wagt hezil eden ýalydy.
He gave her hope.	Oňa umyt berdi.
I think it would be great.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gaty gowy bolardy.
That was the word.	Ol söz boldy.
You are someone else	Sen başga biri
You are no longer	Sen indi däl
Who can be better.	Kim has gowy bolup bilmez.
He never thought it would happen.	Beýle boljakdygyny asla pikir etmedi.
One day, somewhere else.	Ol bir gün, başga bir ýerde.
It didn't seem right to me.	Bu meniň üçin dogry iş ýaly däldi.
I called his house.	Men onuň öýüne jaň etdim.
Just be there and be quick.	Diňe şol ýerde bolmaly we çalt bolmaly.
All he needs is time.	Oňa zerur zat wagt.
That sounds like a good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat ýaly.
This is not about me at all.	Bu düýbünden men hakda däl.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
Last night	Iň soňky gije.
This book is for you	Bu kitap siziň üçin
I am very close	Men gaty ýakyn
There was always this weird stuff.	Elmydama bu geň zatlar bardy.
There is no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýok.
Great and bad.	Ajaýyp we erbet.
One voice, one man.	Bir ses, bir adam.
It was not happy.	Bu bagtly däldi.
Maybe not always easy.	Belki elmydama aňsat däl.
It's bigger than me.	Bu menden uly.
The man was surprised.	Ol adam geň galdy.
It came out.	Çykdy.
I'm fine right now.	Men şu wagt gaty gowy.
There is no money at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda pul ýok.
He is not one and will never be.	Ol bir däl we hiç haçan bolmaz.
She looked very young.	Ol gaty ýaş ýalydy.
No more work.	Indi iş ýok.
You can make more money there.	Ol ýerde has köp pul alyp bilersiňiz.
That can't be the case.	Bu kän bir ýaly bolup bilmez.
Almost everywhere.	Hemme ýerde diýen ýaly.
There is always tomorrow.	Elmydama ertir bar.
There, there, and there.	Ol ýerde, ol ýerde we ol ýerde.
No problem here.	Bu ýerde kynçylyk ýok.
Maybe he'll come to you.	Belki, ol saňa geler.
These things happen.	Bu zatlar bolýar.
This often happens.	Bu köplenç bolýar.
I think it's too late.	Gijä galdy öýdýän.
She can't sleep.	Ol uklap bilmeýär.
I can do things better.	Men zatlary has gowy edip bilýärin.
He was there to get it.	Ol ýere almak üçin bardy.
Life looks like this.	Durmuş şeýle bolup görünýär.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
This is not possible at all.	Bu asla mümkin däl.
Everyone wants it.	Her kim ony isleýär.
Not as young as before.	Öňküsi ýaly ýaş däl.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle däl.
I told her this morning.	Men oňa şu gün irden aýtdym.
You are in the same house.	Sen bir öýde.
You can see it now.	Ony indi görüp bilersiňiz.
Oh, maybe another time.	Aý, belki başga bir wagt.
You are also the most beautiful.	Siz hem iň owadan.
That will never happen.	Hiç haçan beýle zat bolmaz.
Life was good.	Durmuş gowy boldy.
Once, then again.	Bir gezek, soň ýene.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
This is a very good question.	Bu gaty gowy sorag.
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele.
Not just a few things.	Diňe birnäçe zat däl.
Not a good day.	Gowy gün däl.
Have fun every time.	Her gezek hezil.
I thought it might be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolup biler diýip pikir etdim.
This is nowhere and everywhere.	Bu hiç ýerde we hemme ýerde.
Oh, that's good.	Aý, bu gowy.
She still looked good.	Ol henizem gowy ýalydy.
Why even here?	Näme üçin hatda şu ýerde?
I will help you.	Men size kömek ederin.
They are completely different.	Olar düýbünden başga zat.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda bu başga bir zat ýaly bolup görünýär.
I never did that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmedim.
This way.	Bu ýol bilen.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
Of course, it was the next.	Elbetde, ol indiki boldy.
I have to go.	Men gitmeli.
Of course you have to.	Elbetde etmeli.
It can be done quickly.	Çalt edip bolýar.
No one here could say what he was thinking.	Bu ýerde hiç kim onuň näme pikir edýändigini aýdyp bilmedi.
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
There is no book here.	Bu ýerde kitap ýok.
I know what he wants.	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilýärin.
He does something.	Ol bir zatlar edýär.
This was not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däldi.
Now tonight.	Indi şu gije bar.
That's bad advice.	Bu erbet maslahat.
They are everywhere about us.	Olar biziň hakda hemme ýerde.
Too much attention to it.	Oňa köp üns bermek.
He said it could happen.	Bolup biljekdigini aýtdy.
That would always be the case.	Elmydama şeýle bolardy.
I hope he does.	Muny eder diýip umyt edýärin.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
It could be about a year.	Bir ýyl ýaly bolup biler.
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele ýok.
No more meat for me now.	Indi meniň üçin et ýok.
He knew everything.	Hemme zady bilýärdi.
The idea seemed interesting.	Bu pikir gyzykly ýalydy.
I couldn't get it right now.	Men häzir muny alyp bilmedim.
I think it exists now.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol häzir bar.
Not just now.	Diňe häzir däl.
Everyone is for themselves.	Her bir adam özi üçin.
Bad mistake.	Erbet ýalňyşlyk.
Bad, very good.	Erbet, gaty gowy.
I want to do this for myself.	Muny özüm üçin etmek isleýärin.
Actually two or three.	Aslynda iki ýa-da üç.
Crazy	Däli.
I had enough.	Mende ýeterlik boldy.
It can make you crazy.	Seni däli edip biler.
Several times a night.	Her gije birnäçe gezek.
He didn't have to tell you.	Ol saňa aýtmaly däldi.
I'll do it here.	Men muny şu ýerde ederin.
I never thought of him.	Men oňa hiç wagt pikir etmedim.
It's too far.	Şeýle hem gaty uzak.
I'll take care of that.	Men muňa alada ederin.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
I can't do it again	Men ýene edip bilemok
Of course not.	Elbetde, bu ýerde beýle däl.
You have to call the police.	Polisiýa jaň etmeli.
Very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly.
It wasn't much.	Bu kän däldi.
Why worry?	Näme üçin alada etmeli?
Who, why, how.	Kim, näme üçin, nädip.
Something beautiful and stupid.	Owadan we samsyk bir zat.
It was just one day.	Bir gün ýöne bir gün boldy.
We can't see anything else at home right now.	Häzir öýde başga zat görüp bilmeris.
I'm not good enough.	Men oňa ýeterlik däl.
Of course, this is only true.	Bu, elbetde, diňe dogry.
He will come here.	Bu ýere geler.
You must be aware of this.	Bu hakda bilýän bolmaly.
I think it will take some time.	Oňa biraz wagt gerek diýip pikir edýärin.
This time he did nothing.	Bu gezek hiç zat etmedi.
What happened to him.	Ol näme boldy.
He wants to go there.	Ol ýere gitmek isleýär.
I didn’t always do that.	Men muny elmydama etmedim.
I can't see	Men görüp bilemok
It's easy to tell you.	Size aýtmak aňsat.
You will need some help here.	Bu ýerde biraz kömek gerek bolar.
Two months was not enough here.	Bu ýerde iki aý ýeterlik däldi.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
It's too early.	Gaty ir.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
The money is still there.	Pul henizem bar.
Even one is too much.	Hatda biri gaty köp.
Just what you need.	Diňe zerur zatlar.
He never spoke.	Ol hiç haçan söz aýtmady.
It’s hard to vote well.	Gowy ses bermek kyn.
Not even like a girl.	Hatda gyz ýaly däl.
I don’t have to do that alone.	Men muny ýeke etmeli däl.
I don't know how that happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilenok.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Me.	Ine.
That guy too.	Şol ýigit hem.

Not really new.	Aslynda täze däl.
From now on with you.	Mundan beýläk seniň bilen.
Here it is.	Ine, biri.
It looks crazy.	Bu däli ýaly bolup görünýär.
It's been a good week.	Gowy hepde boldy.
It's really smart.	Aslynda gaty akylly.
This is a fast job.	Bu çalt iş.
It will be bad for the job.	Iş üçin erbet bolar.
It's weird.	Bir geň zat.
Because why not.	Sebäbi näme üçin ýok.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
He did not want to be with them.	Ol olar bilen bolmak islemedi.
There is something there.	Ol ýerde bir zat bar.
That sounds great.	Bu gaty gowy ýaly.
You will need a book for this.	Munuň üçin kitap gerek bolar.
It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
Not even life.	Durmuş hem däl.
There is something wonderful about it.	Bu ýerde ajaýyp bir zat bar.
Of course not now.	Elbetde, häzir däl.
I haven't seen much.	Men kän görmedim.
Maybe it's really there.	Belki, hakykatdanam ol ýerde.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň sebäbi şeýle.
He came.	Ol geldi.
This bar.	Bu bar.
They weren't there much.	Olar ol ýerde kän däldi.
It was tonight.	Bu gije bardy.
No one is going to help me.	Hiç kim maňa kömek etjek däl.
If there is another.	Başga biri bar bolsa.
Nothing new.	Hiç zat täze däl.
No work.	Iş ýok.
You can tell me tomorrow.	Ertir maňa aýdyp bilersiňiz.
I think this is a great way.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy ýol.

He did not want to talk about it.	Ol bu hakda gürleşmek islemedi.
It's been a week.	Bir hepde boldy.
I couldn't think.	Men pikir edip bilmedim.
I have to tell you tonight.	Şu gije saňa aýtmaly.
You know, I've seen it a few times.	Bilýärsiň, men ony birnäçe gezek gördüm.
It took him a long time to respond.	Oňa jogap bermek üçin köp wagt gerek boldy.
Who sings?	Kim aýdym aýdýar?
Must be fun!	Gyzykly bolmaly!
That's a lot.	Bu köp boldy.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle däl.
He was like that.	Ol şeýle adam ýalydy.
That's all he needs right now.	Ine, häzir oňa zerur zat.
He knows this very well.	Ol beýle zady gowy bilýär.
It was good with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy boldy.
I am no more	Men indi ýok
He did well.	Gowy etdi.
Not old enough to know better.	Mundan has gowy bilmeýän ýeterlik ýaş.
I think that's possible.	Bu mümkin diýip pikir edýärin.
I decided.	Men karar berdim.
I can't do anything about it	Men onuň bilen hiç zat edip bilemok
I still need	Maňa henizem gerek.
I always do.	Men elmydama edýärin.
In fact.	Aslynda.
Now we have the opportunity to do something about it.	Indi bu hakda bir zat etmäge mümkinçilik bar.
There was no one and nothing.	Ol ýerde hiç kim we hiç zat ýokdy.
He thinks this is a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir diýip pikir edýär.
You don't have to think about it.	Bu hakda pikir etmek hökman däl.
I didn't want to go there.	Men ol ýere gitmek islemedim.
He must have known better.	Ol has gowy bilýän bolmaly.
What a good man.	Nähili gowy adam.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
No time for anything else.	Başga zat üçin wagt ýok.
I didn't think much of it.	Men bu hakda kän pikir etmedim.
I don't need anything.	Menden hiç zat gerek däl.
There is still a lot to do!	Entek etmeli köp zat galdy!.
This is also true.	Bu hem dogry.
He could see now.	Ol indi görüp bilýärdi.
The future, the future.	Geljek, geler.
This is strange for me.	Meniň üçin bu geň.
This is not a mistake.	Bu bir ýalňyşlyk däl.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
This did not bother me.	Bu bolsa meni biynjalyk etmedi.
He could not go.	Ol gidip bilmedi.
And for some as a baby gets older, he or she will outgrow this.	Uly bolsa hökman gowy däl.
He returned to work.	Ol işe gaýdyp geldi.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman mesele däl.
I did a great job.	Men gaty gowy iş etdim.
It was evening.	Agşam boldy.
He will do so.	Şeýle eder.
The hardest part is agreeing.	Iň kyn mesele, razy.
That alone is not enough.	Diňe bu ýeterlik däl.
He told me he wasn't there that day.	Ol maňa şol gün ýokdugyny aýtdy.
A man came out for what he could get.	Bir adam alyp biljek zady üçin çykdy.
We are not police.	Biz polisiýa däl.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
This song is great.	Bu aýdym gaty gowy.
The sound came out.	Ses çykdy.
He wants to talk.	Ol gürleşmek isleýär.
Often not enough.	Köplenç ýeterlik däl.
This can be good or bad.	Bu gowy ýa-da erbet zat bolup biler.
He got one.	Ol birini aldy.

It looks great.	Bu gaty gowy görünýär.
I think you will agree.	Meniň pikirimçe, muňa razy bolarsyňyz.
I only happen once.	Men diňe bir gezek bolýar.
Something very new for him.	Onuň üçin gaty täze bir zat.
One thing for sure.	Elbetde, bir zat.
Everything worked out.	Hemme zat köp iş etdi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
He did just that.	Edil şonuň ýaly etdi.
The food was not bad, but good.	Nahar erbet däldi, ýöne gowy.
We have to, but we can't.	Biz etmeli, ýöne edip bilmeris.
In addition.	Mundan başga.
It's not like once.	Bu bir gezek ýaly däl.
It's actually a lot, but it's very interesting.	Aslynda gaty köp, ýöne gaty gyzykly.
This is nothing new for me.	Bu meniň üçin täze zat däl.
Fastest now.	Häzirki wagtda iň çalt.
In fact, many.	Aslynda köp.
It makes it possible.	Mümkinçilik ýaly edýär.
It would be interesting to see that.	Muny görmek gyzykly bolardy.
You can pay attention.	Üns berip bilersiňiz.
You have to be hard.	Siz gaty bolmaly.
This is a job.	Bu bir iş.
There was always hope.	Elmydama umyt bardy.
This is a mistake.	Bu düýbünden ýalňyşlyk.
This is also difficult.	Bu hem kyn.
I do not ask.	Men haýyş etmeýärin.
I don't want to do that.	Men muny etmek islämok.
It must be the first time.	Ilkinji gezek bolmaly.
He never paid attention.	Oňa hiç wagt üns bermedi.
Of course, this is very bad.	Elbetde, bu gaty erbet.
I can't be mad at you for that.	Munuň üçin saňa däli bolup bilemok.
Something could happen there.	Ol ýerde bir zat bolup biler.
I need help.	Kömek isleýärin.
It's more serious, but it's really interesting.	Bu has çynlakaý, ýöne hakykatdanam gyzykly bir zat.
It comes later.	Soň gelýär.
He likes to do these things.	Ol bu zatlary etmegi halaýar.
I don't know.	Men muny bilemok.
It will be fun, everyone will be there.	Gyzykly bolar, hemmeler şol ýerde bolar.
He said he hoped everything would be fine.	Hemme zadyň gowy boljakdygyna umyt edýändigini aýtdy.
Nothing can be the same as before.	Hiç zat öňküsi ýaly bolup bilmez.
Too many people.	Adam gaty köp.
I was a little short yesterday.	Düýn biraz gysga boldum.
It's great to know that.	Muny bilmek gaty gowy zat.
Maybe this will help.	Belki bu kömek eder.
I want to go	Men gitmek isleýärin
Wants to get	Almak isleýär.
It was as if no one knew anything about him.	Hiç kim ol hakda hiç zat bilmeýän ýalydy.
I want to be right.	Dogry etmek isleýärin.
Same thing.	Edil şol bir zat.
To whom he said as before.	Kime öňküsi ýaly aýtdy.

Of course, he was right.	Elbetde, ol gaty dogry aýtdy.
There is a way.	Bir ýol bar.
Everything about them.	Olar hakda hemme zat.

This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
And then it's good.	Soň bolsa gowy.
Please, it helped me.	Haýyş edýärin, maňa kömek etdi.
I have to do that	Men muny etmeli
This is really the first word.	Bu hakykatdanam ilkinji söz.
This time last year I was worried.	Geçen ýyl bu gezek alada etdim.
He seemed to know it very well.	Ony gaty erbet bilýän ýalydy.
Today was not a good day.	Bu gün gowy gün däldi.
Really	Hakykatdanam.
This is a very strange idea.	Bu gaty geň pikir.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
The last few years.	Soňky birnäçe ýyl.
In fact, this is not the case.	Aslynda bu beýle däl.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
This is not possible at all.	Bu düýbünden mümkin däl.
He is with one or two people.	Ol bir ýa-da iki adam bilen.
Where are they	Olar nirede?
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
I won't be here long.	Men bu ýerde uzak bolmaz.
It will also destroy you.	Şeýle hem, sizi ýok eder.
No one did anything.	Hiç kim hiç zat etmedi.
I have to sing.	Aýdym aýtmaly.
I don't care anymore.	Indi alada etmeýärin.
Hard, but absolutely necessary.	Gaty, ýöne düýbünden zerur.
Too stupid, too stupid.	Gaty samsyk, gaty samsyk.
He didn't know better.	Ol has gowy bilmeýärdi.
Of course, there is a reason for this.	Elbetde, munuň sebäbi bar.
We had two.	Ikimiz bardy.
I really don't know.	Men hakykatdanam bilemok.

Maybe so for him.	Belki, onuň üçin şeýle.
I'm not serious about that.	Men muňa düýbünden çynlakaý däl.
I'm a good cop	Men gowy polisiýa
That alone would be very interesting.	Diňe bu gaty gyzykly bolardy.
He knew it now.	Ol muny indi bilýärdi.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň zat.
This is good and good.	Bu gowy we gowy.
At the time, he did something strange.	Şol wagt ol geň bir zat etdi.
That's what you want.	Ine, seniň isleýän zadyň.
It was good to have a rest.	Dynç almak gowy boldy.
It was good to be home.	Öýde bolmak gowy boldy.
He too.	Ol hem.
It was a crazy night for both of us.	Bu ikimiz üçin däli gije boldy.
Then it wasn’t about him, he understood.	Soň bu onuň hakda däldi, düşündi.
Bad day	Erbet gün.
It took several years.	Birnäçe ýyl gerek boldy.
That's it.	Ine, şeýle.
This was not the case at all.	Bu düýbünden beýle däldi.
You know	Bilýärsiň.
A kind of sound.	Bir hili ses.
I think it was good.	Gowy boldy diýip pikir edýärin.
In fact, there was no other way.	Aslynda başga ýol ýokdy.
He was no longer human.	Ol indi adam däldi.
It's really cool.	Aslynda gaty ajaýyp.
He can tell now.	Häzir aýdyp biler.
Credit.	Karz.
I think about myself.	Men özüm hakda pikir edýärin.
He said who did it.	Ol muny kim etdi diýdi.
He promised me a lot.	Ol maňa köp söz berdi.
He told her he was not alone.	Ol özüne ýeke däldigini aýtdy.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
I don't know anything	Men hiç zat bilemok
Not long.	Uzak däl.
Good news for me.	Meniň üçin gowy we erbet habar.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Good.	Gowy.
He will come soon.	Ol gysga wagtda geler.
I even thought about doing it again.	Hatda ýene etmegi pikir etdim.
This is a big deal for me.	Bu meniň üçin uly zat.
Which one.	Haýsy.
It doesn't make anyone happy.	Bu hiç kimi bagtly etmeýär.
Now it was just me.	Häzir diňe özüm ýalydy.
Good job	Gowy iş.
I think everything is fine.	Meniň pikirimçe, hemme zat gowy.
Too bad for them.	Olar üçin gaty erbet.

Just a few hours.	Diňe birnäçe sagat.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
Never, or never.	Hiç haçan, ýa-da hiç haçan diýen ýaly.
So that shouldn’t be the case.	Şonuň üçin bu hiç zat bolmaly däl.
This is for us.	Bu biziň üçin.
Such a good thing.	Munuň ýaly gowy zat.
I hope it will be one.	Bir bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
I think you can do worse.	Has erbet edip bilersiňiz öýdýän.
He really did exist.	Ol hakykatdanam bardy.
Because he couldn't.	Sebäbi edip bilmedi.
And then he does.	Soň bolsa edýär.
I want something else.	Başga bir zat üçin isleýärin.
That makes us.	Bu bizi edýär.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp ýaly görünýär.
One thing for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin bir zat.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
That could be the case.	Şeýle bolup biler.
Next time a stupid idiot.	Indiki gezek samsyk samsyk.
He was always there.	Elmydama bardy.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, edil şeýle.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki, şu wagt bolup geçen bolsa gerek.
It was so bad.	Bu gaty erbet boldy.
I knew there would be more.	Has köp zadyň boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
This is serious.	Bu çynlakaý.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.

This idea seems very interesting.	Bu pikir gaty gyzykly ýaly.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
Okay, we're here.	Bolýar, biz şu ýerde.

No one can harm us.	Hiç kim bize zyýan berip bilmez.
You are nothing	Sen hiç zat däl
I didn't think so.	Men beýle pikir etmedim.

There was no money.	Pul ýokdy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Munuň üçin hiç zat ýok.
It would be bad.	Erbet bolardy.
Nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýok.
I don’t know how that could be.	Munuň nädip bolup biljekdigini bilemok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe gowy iş.
Someone will be there soon.	Kimdir biri ýakyn wagtda şol ýerde bolar.
The question is what will happen next.	Sorag indiki näme bolar.
It seemed impossible.	Mümkin däl ýalydy.
He did not agree.	Ol muňa razy däldi.
He arrived very early this morning.	Ol şu gün irden gaty kyn geldi.
This must be for me.	Bu meniň üçin bolmaly.

So no problem.	Şonuň üçin mesele ýok.
Do it yourself.	Hemmesini özüňiz.
Only a hundred people came.	Diňe ýüz adam geldi.

It’s fun, but a little difficult.	Bu gyzykly, ýöne birneme kyn.
He asked about me.	Ol meniň hakda sorady.
I never thought.	Men asla pikir etmedim.
You can do it in two places.	Iki ýerde edip bilersiňiz.
Everything is possible.	Hemme zat mümkin.
This is a very difficult thing.	Bu gaty kyn zat.
About who.	Kim hakda.
Life is hard for me.	Meniň üçin durmuş gaty kyn.

You'll have to go somewhere else.	Başga bir gitmeli bolarsyňyz.

It's been a long time coming.	Uzak wagt boldy.
For good and bad.	Gowy we erbet üçin.

This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, has geň zat.
Maybe nothing will happen.	Belki asla hiç zat bolmaz.

I can't do that	Men munuň ýaly zady edip bilemok
This is not for me.	Bu meniň üçin däl.
He couldn't do that either.	Şeýle hem edip bilmedi.
There was a lot of noise.	Köp ses çykdy.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Gaty gowy zatlar gaty köp.
Often this was not the case.	Köplenç beýle däldi.
There was no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýokdy.
This is never the case.	Hiç wagt beýle däl.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
Nothing too big.	Gaty uly zat ýok.
It should be the same.	Şeýle hem bolmaly.
He knew nothing about life.	Durmuş hakda hiç zat bilmeýärdi.
Good advice.	Gowy maslahat.
It was yesterday.	Bu düýn boldy.
We are still new.	Biz entek täze.
I do not know.	Men bilemok.
Of course, that was the case.	Elbetde, bu şeýle boldy.
He was already there.	Ol öňem bardy.
This is not at home.	Bu öýde däl.
This decision is correct.	Bu karar dogry.
I couldn't	Edip bilmedim
I know a lot.	Men köp zady bilýärin.
Now no one can help.	Indi hiç kim kömek edip bilmez.
At this point no one said anything.	Bu wagt hiç kim hiç zat aýtmady.
So it was difficult.	Şonuň üçin bu kyn boldy.
This is it.	Bu şu.
Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
He thinks it's okay.	Bolýar diýip pikir edýär.

You can even see this.	Muny hatda görüp bilersiňiz.

There was no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýokdy.
He does more.	Ol has köp zat edýär.
I had to help.	Men kömek etmeli boldum.
I don't think that's a good thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy zat däl.
Nothing to do with you.	Seniň bilen hiç zat ýok.
Maybe there was nothing there.	Belki, ol ýerde asla hiç zat ýokdy.
Man this is very difficult.	Adam bu gaty kyn.
No one will agree.	Hiç kim muňa razy bolmaz.
It could be good.	Gowy bolup biler.
Only two.	Diňe iki.
It won't be fun.	Bu gyzykly bolmaz.
I can't go to it	Men oňa baryp bilemok
Many people.	Köp adam.
I still think he can.	Henizem edip biler öýdýärin.
It was me.	Bu men boldum.
He wants to do it himself.	Muny özi etmek isleýär.
Looks like the last one.	Iň soňky ýaly görünýär.
This is a very interesting issue.	Bu gaty gyzykly mesele.
He told me everything about it.	Ol maňa bu hakda hemme zady aýtdy.
That's it.	Ine, şol ýerde.
I can't see how to help it.	Muňa nädip kömek edip boljakdygyny görüp bilemok.
For everyone, or nothing.	Hemmeler üçin, ýa-da hiç zat däl.
So he had to go.	Şonuň üçin ol gitmeli boldy.
Even so, owning one is still beyond the reach of the average person.	Hatda bu gaty köp.
What did he think?	Ol näme diýip pikir etdi.
I'm not bad.	Men erbet däl.
Of course, I don't want that again.	Elbetde, men muny ýene islämok.
In fact, it is not me.	Aslynda bu men däl.
So many challenges and so much fun.	Gaty köp kynçylyk we gaty gyzykly.
It didn't bother me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etmedi.
It will take time.	Wagt gerek bolar.
I don't want to be someone else.	Başga biri bolmak islämok.
It just has to be good.	Ol diňe gowy bolmaly.
I thought you knew.	Bilýärsiň öýdüpdim.
What is this	Bu näme.
This is a very good question.	Bu gaty gowy sorag.
This is not very good.	Bu gaty gowy däl.
He did not know what it would be like.	Onuň nähili boljakdygyny bilmeýärdi.
Not good, but good.	Gowy däl, ýöne gowy.
Just then the sound.	Edil şol wagt ses.
He did not want to hurt her.	Ol oňa zyýan bermek islemedi.
He gave it.	Ol muny berdi.
I thought it was great.	Ajaýyp diýip pikir etdim.
He didn't think so.	Ol pikir etmedi.
Now no one can harm you.	Indi hiç kim size zyýan berip bilmez.
One or two words.	Bir ýa-da iki söz.
So he had to go.	Şonuň üçin gitmeli boldy.
That's great!	Bu gaty gowy!
You have to decide later.	Soň karar bermeli.
He had to give it to her.	Ol oňa bermeli boldy.
This month.	Bu aý.
He couldn't help it.	Ol oňa kömek edip bilmedi.
I need it very badly.	Maňa gaty erbet gerek.
That was the problem.	Bu mesele boldy.
We can't call.	Biz jaň edip bilmeris.
He never wanted to talk to her.	Ol onuň bilen asla gürleşmek islemedi.
I really want to visit here one day.	Men hakykatdanam bir gün bu ýere baryp görmek isleýärin.
I'm sure everything will be fine.	Hemme zadyň gowy boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
Here	Şu ýerde.
He didn't need a word.	Oňa söz gerek däldi.
He knows where he wants to go.	Nirä gitmek isleýändigini bilýär.
Never.	Asla.
In fact, it was almost always.	Aslynda bu hemişe diýen ýalydy.
There was no one else.	Şeýle hem biri ýokdy.
Only a handful of people can do that.	Muny diňe birnäçe adam edip biler.
The clock is ticking.	Sagat ýakyn.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
What.	Näme.
This is not a lie.	Bu ýalan däl.
It's great to be right.	Dogry bolmak gaty gowy.
No words for that.	Munuň üçin söz ýok.
A week	Bir hepde.
No work.	Iş ýok.
It actually comes.	Aslynda gelýär.

It was as if he wanted the same thing.	Edil şol bir zady isleýän ýalydy.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
He knew everything now.	Ol indi hemme zady bilýärdi.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
And then there was no one.	Soň bolsa hiç kim ýokdy.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I knew he could hurt me.	Onuň maňa zyýan berip biljekdigini bilýärdim.
There were a number of issues.	Birnäçe mesele bardy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ol hakda bolmaly.
This is working time.	Bu iş wagty.
This decision cannot be more accurate.	Bu karar has dogry bolup bilmez.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Many questions, not enough answers yet.	Köp sorag, henizem ýeterlik jogap ýok.
This is for me.	Bu meniň üçin.
This is not surprising to me.	Bu meniň üçin geň däl.
I've heard a lot about you.	Men sen hakda köp eşitdim.
He is not ready for that.	Ol muňa taýyn däl.
It won't be overnight.	Bir gije bolmaz.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Başga birini etmegiň wagty geldi.
A lot of people live there.	Ol ýerde köp adam ýaşaýar.
This can be serious.	Bu çynlakaý bolup biler.
He wants it.	Muny özi isleýär.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
This statement was not false.	Bu söz ýalan däldi.
I hope you agree.	Razy bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin.
This is very possible.	Bu gaty mümkin.
I didn't want to.	Islemedim.
A few months ago.	Birnäçe aý öň.
He wants to do it all night.	Ony bütin gije etmek isleýär.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He told me several times.	Ol maňa birnäçe gezek aýtdy.
Sound bar.	Ses bar.
It turned out really well.	Hakykatdanam gowy çykdy.
He knows it, but he doesn't know it.	Muny bilýär, ýöne bilmeýär.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
Here's a question.	Ine bir sorag.
No one can see me.	Hiç kim meni görüp bilmeýär.
Because there is no answer.	Sebäbi jogap ýok.
There he confessed.	Ol ýerde muny boýun aldy.
He didn't want me anymore.	Ol meni indi islemedi.
Couldn't get there.	Ol ýere baryp bilmedi.
This is a problem for me.	Meniň üçin bu bir mesele.
It should be.	Bu bolmaly.
He did it now.	Indi etdi.
He would always be there.	Elmydama ol ýerde bolardy.
Okay, okay, that's not right.	Bolýar, bolýar, bu dogry däl.
This can be fun.	Bu gyzykly bolup biler.
Maybe that's the problem.	Belki, bu mesele bolup biler.
It seemed like the best thing to do.	Iň gowy zat ýalydy.
It looks serious.	Bu çynlakaý görünýär.
In fact, life is good.	Aslynda durmuş gowy.
This time he took me with him.	Bu gezek meni özi bilen alyp gitdi.
It's not really beautiful.	Bu hakykatdanam owadan däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu bir zat, şeýlemi?
I had enough money.	Mende ýeterlik pul bardy.
He doesn't seem to be worried.	Ol biynjalyk däl ýaly.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp.
He decided to do it.	Ol muny etmek kararyna geldi.
It took a long time to say that.	Muny aýtmak üçin köp wagt aldy.
You can see this clearly here.	Muny şu ýerde aýdyň görüp bilersiňiz.
The next big issue.	Indiki uly mesele.
I don't care.	Men alada etmeýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hem gowy zat.
I will destroy everything.	Men hemme zady ýok ederin.
It has always been about money.	Bu elmydama pul hakda boldy.
Anyone can and should and should.	Her kim edip biler we etmeli we etmeli.
I thought this was not a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir däl diýip pikir etdim.
Me.	Ine.
He does not.	Ol beýle etmeýär.
He didn't need time.	Oňa wagt gerek däldi.
Of course not always.	Elbetde, hemişe däl.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
He knew what to do.	Ol näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
This is often not the case.	Bu köplenç mesele däl.
He has no time for me.	Onuň meniň üçin wagty ýok.
I can't hurt you.	Men saňa zyýan berip bilemok.
A little strange.	Biraz geň.
Everyone would be better off.	Hemmeler has gowy bolardy.
It seemed too far now.	Häzir gaty uzak ýalydy.
There were so many good things about him.	Ol hakda gaty gowy zatlar bardy.
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
He can't do that.	Ol muny edip bilmeýär.
This is a bad thing.	Bu bir erbet zat.
It was a good day.	Gowy gün boldy.
You are that	Sen şol
He can't say no.	Ol ýok diýip bilmeýär.
He still had a chance.	Oňa henizem mümkinçilik bardy.
In fact, it's not good or bad.	Aslynda bu gowy ýa-da erbet däl.
I didn't want to.	Men islemedim.
Now we need a new one.	Indi bize täze biri gerek.
He did not know he was here.	Ol bu ýerde bolandygyny bilmeýärdi.
In fact, nothing.	Aslynda hiç zat ýok.
You are a smart girl	Sen akylly gyz
That was not the case.	Bu mesele däldi.

Okay.	Bolýar.

How interesting it would be.	Bu nähili gyzykly bolardy.
It should never have happened.	Bu hiç wagt bolmaly däldi.

What's wrong with me?	Maňa näme bolýar.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
These things happened.	Bu zatlar boldy.
Maybe not.	Belki ýok.
I didn’t always know that.	Men muny hemişe bilmeýärdim.
In fact, there was not much to do.	Aslynda ol ýerde kän zat ýokdy.
He left tomorrow.	Ertir ol gitdi.
It wasn't that close.	Ol beýle ýakyn wagty däldi.
Maybe he can just be good with money.	Belki, ol diňe pul bilen gowy bolup biler.
No one likes you.	Hiç kim seni halamaýar.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
It may not be this year, but it will.	Bu ýyl bolup bilmez, ýöne eder.
It would be nice if everyone had to go.	Her kim gitmeli bolsa gowy bolardy.
There are more.	Ol ýerde has köp.
He was crazy.	Ol däli boldy.

Maybe he just needs a job.	Belki, oňa diňe bir iş gerek.
It seems to have helped.	Kömek eden ýaly.

The worst.	Iň erbet.
He helped us a lot.	Ol bize köp kömek etdi.
I saw it last night.	Düýn agşam gördüm.

OK, no more.	Bolýar, indi ýok.
Everything would be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolardy.
This girl is great	Bu gyz gaty gowy
Worse and more interesting.	Has erbet we has gyzykly.
She thought she was beautiful.	Ol owadan diýip pikir etdi.
In fact, it was not enough time.	Aslynda, ýeterlik wagt däldi.
Not true.	Dogry däl.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu düýbünden dogry däl.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
He then apologized.	Soň bolsa ötünç sorady.
This is very bad for him.	Bu oňa gaty erbet.
He is not a good man.	Ol gowy adam däl.
Good job for him.	Oňa gowy iş.
I have something to do.	Meniň etmeli zadym bar.

This is a big reason.	Bu uly sebäp.
It would be great.	Gaty gowy bolardy.
A wonderful night two weeks ago.	Iki hepde öň bir ajaýyp gije.
That may be true.	Dogry bolup biler.
I hope someone can help.	Kimdir biri kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.

I've seen it everywhere.	Men ony hemme ýerde gördüm.
So no.	Şonuň üçin asla ýok.
I could not see	Men görüp bilmedim
One last week.	Biri geçen hepde.
This is not an easy song either.	Bu hem aňsat aýdym däl.
Then it happens.	Soň bu bolýar.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
You don't have to be that bad.	Sen beýle erbet bolmaly däl.
I want to talk to him.	Men onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
He does what he wants.	Islän zadyny edýär.
It wasn't so much back then.	Ol wagt beýle bir kän däldi.
This is really great!	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy!
This happens too many times.	Bu gaty köp gezek bolýar.
This is a difficult issue.	Bu bir kyn mesele.
I can do this faster.	Men muny has çalt edip bilerin.
It's very easy for you.	Bu siziň üçin gaty aňsat.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu dogry ýol.

Faster and probably worse.	Has çalt we ähtimal has erbet.
Oh, come on, come on.	Aý, gelýär, gelýär.
You can take a little care.	Biraz alada edip bilersiňiz.
OK, no worries.	Bolýar alada ýok.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
Really weird.	Hakykatdanam gaty geň.
It's not about you.	Bu sen hakda däl.
Here's what you need to know.	Ine, seniň etmeli zadyň.
He didn't even advise.	Maslahat hem etmedi.
I did not call	Men jaň etmedim
There was no sound.	Ses ýokdy.
Just for himself.	Diňe özi üçin.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
He could not answer.	Ol muňa jogap berip bilmedi.
Maybe one day, maybe two.	Belki bir gün, belki iki.
It may take several hours.	Birnäçe sagat bolup biler.
Someone does that.	Kimdir biri muny edýär.
Now it will be bad.	Indi bu erbet bolar.
No advice.	Maslahat gerek däl.
In short.	Gysga.
Of course it can.	Elbetde bolup biler.
Every night	Her gije.
It makes me crazy.	Bu meni däli edýär.
Everyone wants it.	Her kim ony isleýär.
I have to be somewhere or other.	Men bir ýa-da başga bir ýerde bolmaly.
He did not say what it was like.	Ol munuň nähili bolandygyny hiç zat aýtmady.
I couldn't see right.	Dogry görüp bilmedim.
Okay.	Bolýar.
He can't say what he wants.	Islän zadyny aýdyp bilmeýär.
It's really beautiful.	Aslynda owadan.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
I saw you	Men seni gördüm
Both words are false.	Iki söz hem ýalan.
They already look happier.	Olar eýýäm has bagtly görünýär.
I help her a lot.	Men oňa köp kömek edýärin.
She was almost happy.	Ol bagtly diýen ýalydy.
This is crazy.	Bu bir däli.
I hope it will be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
There is no reason to do that.	Muny etmäge hiç hili sebäp ýok.
He wanted it.	Ol muny isledi.
Of course, there is one thing.	Elbetde, munuň hökman bir zady bar.
This is the weirdest thing.	Bu iň geň zat.
He was worried about us.	Ol biziň bilen biynjalyk boldy.
It was not necessary yet.	Bu henizem zerur däldi.
Maybe someone else here can help you.	Belki, bu ýerde başga biri size kömek edip biler.
I often think of this man.	Bu adam hakda köplenç pikir edýärin.
He was good to me.	Ol maňa gowy boldy.
Once for me.	Bir gezek meniň üçin.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
This work is serious.	Bu iş çynlakaý.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
I can't do anything else about it.	Men bu hakda başga zat edip bilemok.
It will.	Bu eder.
This is last year.	Bu geçen ýyl.
This is not impossible.	Bu mümkin däl ýerde däl.
I think this is great.	Bu ajaýyp diýip pikir edýärin.
Only two people disagree.	Diňe iki adam muňa razy däl.
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
It shouldn't be here at this time.	Bu wagt bu ýerde bolmaly däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu karar gelýär.
This is exactly what happened.	Bu düýbünden boldy.
There is always something to do.	Elmydama etmeli bir zat bar.
He is right and he knows that.	Dogry aýdýar we muny bilýär.
What happened?	Bu näme boldy.
It was fun.	Bu hezil boldy.
As you wish.	Ony islän ýaly.
The next one had to go.	Indiki gitmeli boldy.
Just a suggestion.	Diňe bir teklip.
He gave it to me.	Ol maňa berdi.
He was very surprised.	Ol gaty geň galdy.
This is not difficult.	Bu kyn däl.
Okay, maybe not yet.	Bolýar, belki entek ýok.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
She is very happy.	Ol gaty bagtly.
Everyone knows that about me.	Muny men hakda hemmeler bilýär.
This was the first, most obvious reason.	Bu ilkinji, iň aýdyň sebäp boldy.
No book could do that.	Hiç bir kitap muny edip bilmedi.
Great book.	Ajaýyp kitap.
I'm sure that will always be the case.	Elmydama şeýle boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
I don't want that	Men muny islämok
I thought they should be.	Bu olar bolmaly diýip pikir etdim.
This is the song.	Bu aýdym şeýle.
Not bad, though.	Erbet däl, ýöne.
He was not stupid.	Ol samsyk däldi.
Not bad, but not very good.	Erbet däl, ýöne gaty gowy däl.
This is not a bad idea.	Bu erbet pikir däl.
He knew this very well.	Ol muny gaty gowy bilýärdi.
You also have to be happy.	Şeýle hem bagtly bolmaly.
It can't be money.	Bu pul bolup bilmez.
Now he couldn't care less.	Häzir ol bu barada alada edip bilmedi.
Where is he	Ol nirede?
It's been a long time coming.	Uzak wagt boldy.
He knows better than to do that.	Muny etmekden has gowy bilýär.
There is no one to help us.	Bize kömek etjek adam ýok.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
Maybe he likes it.	Belki halaýar.
Not a month went by.	Bir aý kän däldi.
It won't be very good.	Bu gaty gowy bolmaz.
More difficult, but easier.	Has kyn, ýöne has aňsat.
It's about being happy.	Bu bagtly bolmak.
I could be busy.	Men işe almak bilen meşgul bolup bilerin.
I didn’t want to destroy it.	Men muny ýok etmek islemedim.
Quickly, it wasn’t.	Çalt, beýle däldi.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
Ma'am.	Bu.
Well, at least I didn't go down without explaining myself first.	Gowy, ol düýbünden pikir etdi.
Strange or not.	Geň ýa-da ýok.
She seems to know.	Ol bilýän ýaly.
I would like to have a rest here	Bu ýerde dynç almak isleýärin
They are fast.	Olar çalt.
Maybe a hope or two, nothing serious.	Belki bir umyt ýa-da iki, çynlakaý zat ýok.
Just two questions.	Diňe iki sorag.
Good a few times.	Birnäçe gezek gowy.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
I think this is often true.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu köplenç dogry.
Then he came home and.	Soň bolsa öýüne geldi we.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
They are for us and only for us.	Olar biziň we diňe biziň üçin.
Big problem.	Uly kynçylyk.
Maybe it will never be.	Belki, hiç haçan bolmaz.
It started working.	Bu işe başlady.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
I think he likes it.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ony halaýar.
I want to do that	Men muny etmek isleýärin
It didn’t seem very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal däl ýalydy.
I can often talk and talk about it.	Men köplenç bu hakda aýdyp we gürläp bilerin.
So things don't go as planned.	Şonuň üçin zatlar gaty çynlakaý däl ýaly.
We are not the same as before.	Biz öňküsi ýaly däl.
I never know	Men hiç haçan bilemok
And that came to the fore.	Bu bolsa oňa ýere geldi.
I am always the same.	Men hemişe şol bir.
You have to be ready for tomorrow.	Bu gün ertir üçin taýyn bolmaly.
Today	Bu gün.
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
I saw it.	Men ony gördüm.
He agrees with her.	Ol onuň bilen razy.
I don't like it.	Bu meni halamaýar.
We can hope.	Biz umyt edip bileris.
This is bad for you.	Bu siziň üçin erbet.
This is probably true.	Bu dogry bolsa gerek.
You have to get it.	Muny almaly.
It will always be the sun.	Ol elmydama gün bolar.
He will do whatever he wants.	Islän zadyny eder.
How is this even possible?	Bu hatda nädip mümkin?
I know it all.	Muny hemmeler ýaly bilýärin.
Several times.	Birnäçe gezek.
And then it happens to you.	Soň bolsa saňa bolýar.
I'm stupid for him.	Men onuň üçin samsyk.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
He has been there for a long time.	Ol köp wagt bäri şol ýerde.
Can't vote.	Ses berip bilmeýär.
He could not help it.	Ol kömek edip bilmedi.
He will still be human.	Ol entek adam eder.
I did it.	Men muny etdim.
This was not the only reason.	Munuň ýeke-täk sebäbi däldi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Munuň bilen düýbünden ýalňyşlyk ýok.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle däl.
Not us tomorrow.	Ertir biz däl.
He was late.	Ol gijä galdy.
Of course it is possible.	Elbetde mümkin.
You don't have to get permission	Rugsat almaly däl
This should be what you need.	Bu size gerek zat bolmaly.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
A man will.	Bir adam eder.
Here's something else.	Ine başga bir zat.
There is no reason.	Sebäbi ýok.
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Anyone can do that.	Her kim muny edip biler.
I know right away what this is all about.	Munuň näme edýändigini derrew bilýärin.
He can do whatever he wants.	Islän zadyny edip biler.
This is very new.	Bu gaty täze.
New things.	Täze zatlar.
I was worried about something.	Bir zat hakda alada etdim.
I couldn't think of anything.	Men hiç zat hakda pikir edip bilmedim.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
One thing or another.	Bir zat ýa-da başga bir zat.
There he was greeted.	Ol ýerde ony garşy aldy.
This is crazy.	Bu bir däli.
He says he doesn't.	Ol muny etmeýändigini aýdýar.
Only once.	Diňe bir gezek.
This has always been good for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin hemişe gowy boldy.
No one knows.	Muny hiç kim bilenok.
This is too much for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty köp bolýar.
I want to help next year!	Geljek ýyl kömek etmek isleýärin!
It looks like this to you.	Size şeýle görünýär.
She is a girl.	Ol bir gyz.
I don't want one anymore	Indi birini islämok
Impossible, but very difficult.	Mümkin däl, ýöne gaty kyn.
Okay, not much.	Bolýar, kän däldi.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda, maňa şu wagt geldi.
Of course, there was already.	Elbetde, öňem bardy.
Bad for you	Siziň üçin erbet
This is a man, a voice.	Bu bir adam, bir ses.
This is a problem.	Bu bir kynçylyk.
You will also have to take two every day.	Şeýle hem her gün iki almaly bolarsyňyz.
Incorrect and incorrect.	Dogry däl we dogry däl.
He just thought.	Ol diňe pikir etdi.
I have no questions.	Mende sorag ýok.
In fact, this is not true.	Aslynda bu düýbünden dogry däl.
You don't have to lend me money.	Maňa karz bermek hökman däl.
There is always another day.	Elmydama başga bir gün bar.
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
There is no problem.	Ol ýerde mesele ýok.
He did not tell her.	Ol oňa aýtmady.
No money.	Pul ýok.
This is very good advice.	Bu gaty gowy maslahat.
He could not destroy it.	Ol ýok edip bilmedi.
No other suggestion.	Başga teklip ýok.
Something could happen to him.	Oňa bir zat bolup biler.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
He had never thought of that before.	Ol ozal beýle pikir etmedi.
We are really different.	Biz hakykatdanam başga.
Of course, something else could be the right way to go.	Elbetde, başga bir zat dogry ýol bolup biler.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
This is a very big day for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty uly gün.
I hope it will be interesting.	Gyzykly bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
Good, but difficult.	Gowy, ýöne kynçylyk.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
That's the way it is today.	Bu gün şeýle boldy.
Offered to help.	Kömek etmegi teklip etdi.
Several times.	Birnäçe gezek.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
Only here.	Diňe şu ýerde.
We have to.	Biz etmeli.
I think there is more to it.	Meniň pikirimçe, munuň üçin has köp zat bar.
I can't talk for long	Uzak gürläp bilemok
That didn't help.	Bu kömek edip bilmedi.
I did not	Men etmedim
Didn't call last night.	Düýn gije jaň etmedi.
He didn't really think he wanted to know.	Aslynda bilmek isleýändigini pikir etmedi.
He did just that.	Ol muny edil edil şonuň ýaly etdi.
This should be a really good thing.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy zat bolmaly.
There is a problem.	Bir mesele bar.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
I saw and heard there.	Ol ýerde gördüm, eşitdim.
This can be seen in two ways.	Muny iki ýol bilen görmek bolýar.
Of course, there aren't many.	Elbetde, ol ýerde kän däl.

It's really hard.	Hakykatdanam, gaty kyn.
He said he didn't care.	Alada etmeýändigini aýtdy.

Maybe more.	Belki has köp.
Definitely a good thing.	Elbetde gowy zat.
They are really smart.	Olar hakykatdanam gaty akylly.
I think that's great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy.
He did not agree.	Ol muňa razy däldi.
I really don't know.	Men hakykatdanam bilemok.
Something happened and.	Bir zat boldy we.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Munuň üçin hiç zat ýokdy.
There are only two.	Bu diňe iki bolýar.
Here is the book.	Ine, kitap näme.
He was no longer able to do so.	Ol indi däl, oňa muny edip bilmedi.
He did two things.	Iki iş etdi.
Now there is another problem.	Indi ýene bir mesele bar.
You know you have	Seniň bardygyny bilýärsiň.
What a crazy year.	Nähili däli ýyl.

This is not surprising either.	Bu hem geň däl.
This is a really good thing for us.	Biziň üçin bu hakykatdanam gowy zat.
This man did not.	Bu adam etmedi.
He seemed stupid.	Ol samsyk ýalydy.
No one paid attention.	Hiç kim üns bermedi.
It was good yesterday.	Düýn gowy boldy.
Very loud	Gaty ses.
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa ýol bermedi.
I'm not happy today.	Men bu gün bagtly däl.
I do it just for me.	Men muny diňe meniň üçin edýärin.
It happened immediately.	Ol derrew boldy.
Not really a good thing.	Aslynda gowy zat däl.
This made him anxious.	Bu ony biynjalyk etdi.
The big day has come.	Uly gün geldi.
Last Monday	Geçen duşenbe.
Just an idea.	Diňe bir pikir.
Only one thing bothered him.	Ony diňe bir zat biynjalyk etdi.
Definitely available.	Hökman bar.
A good book can do no harm to it.	Gowy kitap bolsa hiç zat oňa zyýan berip bilmez.
No later.	Soň ýok.
So he was not the only one.	Şonuň üçin ol diňe özi däldi.
He didn't say anything to me.	Ol maňa hiç zat aýtmady.
This is me	Bu özüm.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
That should be good enough.	Bu ýeterlik gowy bolmaly.
Adam.	Adam.
In your opinion.	Siziň pikiriňizçe.
He did not say anything about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat aýtmady.
It is not difficult to do this now.	Häzirki wagtda muny etmek kyn zat däl.
Gone.	Gitdi.
Good.	Gowy.
I can do anything.	Men hemme zady edip bilerin.
He could not say it.	Ol muny aýdyp bilmedi.
Just tell me.	Diňe aýdyň.
I did nothing.	Men hiç zat etmedim.
We can't go back there anymore.	Indi ol ýere gaýdyp bilmeris.
He said a lot.	Ol köp diýdi.
Now he knows better.	Indi ol has gowy bilýär.
Today is life.	Bu gün şu, durmuş.
This is work.	Bu iş.
Now we can do better.	Indi has gowy edip bileris.
This was not possible for them.	Bu olar üçin mümkin däldi.
This is a girl.	Bu bir gyz.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
Now this is interesting.	Indi bu gyzykly.
Not so.	Şeýle hem däl.
It wasn't long.	Uzak däldi.
He told the truth.	Ol hakykaty aýtdy.
I have to say something for that.	Munuň üçin bir zat aýtmaly.
The message has arrived.	Habar geldi.
What is it, right?	Bu näme, şeýlemi?
I heard about you	Men sen hakda eşitdim
It may not be so.	Ol beýle däl bolmagy mümkin.
She needs someone to help her.	Oňa kömek etjek biri gerek.
He didn't care anymore.	Ol indi alada etmedi.
This is a wonderful day.	Bu ajaýyp gün.
Oh, he knew it.	Aý, ol muny gowy bilýärdi.
He wanted to talk to her.	Ol onuň bilen gürleşmek isledi.
In fact, more is coming.	Aslynda has köp zat gelýär.
Of course something bad will happen.	Elbetde erbet zat bolar.
Just do it.	Diňe et.
Such a stupid answer.	Şeýle samsyk jogap.
Not with him.	Onuň bilen däl.
The night is still young.	Gije henizem ýaş.
I got a lot here.	Men bu ýerde gaty köp zat aldym.
They are such a mess.	Olar şeýle bir biynjalyk.
It really happened.	Bu hakykatdanam boldy.
No one gave him anything.	Hiç kim oňa hiç zat bermedi.
He has said this several times.	Ol muny birnäçe gezek aýtdy.
She enjoyed it.	Ol uly lezzet aldy.
Something bigger than me.	Menden uly bir zat.
You can call me	Maňa jaň edip bilersiňiz
Just a word.	Diňe bir söz.
That's not enough.	Ol ýeterlik däl.
This is not even a wonderful thing.	Bu hatda ajaýyp zat däl.
What could happen.	Näme bolup biler.
I do it myself.	Men özüm edýärin.
You don't need much.	Size köp zat gerek däl.
Not for three days.	Üç gün däl.
Of course it should be.	Elbetde şeýle bolmaly.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
You can't do more, you can't buy more.	Has köp zat edip bolmaz, has köp zat satyn alyp bolmaz.
I think about it a lot.	Men bu hakda köp pikir edýärin.
I have an idea.	Mende pikir bar.
Really beautiful.	Hakykatdanam owadan.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
He can help you.	Ol size kömek edip biler.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe iş.
It’s not hard to see that this is the case.	Munuň beýle bolandygyny görmek kyn däl.
Too young for something.	Bir zat üçin gaty ýaş.
He was nowhere.	Ol hiç ýerde däldi.
There is another issue.	Başga bir mesele bar.
It's just that.	Bu diňe.
There were not many people there.	Ol ýerde gaty köp adam ýokdy.
I think it's been a long time.	Bu uzak wagt boldy öýdýän.
She behaved beautifully.	Ol owadan alyp bardy.
The sooner the better, maybe.	Näçe ir bolsa gowy bolar, belki.
It's not too early.	Şeýle hem ir däl.
It will only be two weeks.	Diňe iki hepde bolar.
Of course, this was not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däldi.
So they are not really good.	Şonuň üçin olar hakykatdanam gowy däl.
The next decision is very easy.	Indiki karar gaty aňsat bolýar.
She looks weird.	Ol geň görünýär.
We can help you quickly.	Size çalt kömek edip bileris.
It was good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy boldy.
He can't, he shouldn't go.	Ol edip bilmeýär, gitmeli däl.
The pleasure is too much for me.	Lezzet meniň üçin gaty köp bolýar.
One thing for sure.	Elbetde, bir zat.
I'm with him.	Men onuň bilen.
This is not really difficult.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn däl.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
You will need it.	Size gerek bolar.
I'm sorry, really.	Bagyşlaň, hakykatdanam.
It didn't bother me much.	Bu meni gaty biynjalyk etmedi.
There is nothing wrong with agreeing to do so.	Muny etmäge razy bolmak bilen hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
It was very close and there was a call.	Bu jaň etmek üçin gaty ýakyn we bardy.
She is really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy.
He took me here.	Meni şu ýere alyp gitdi.
Not everyone did.	Hemmeler etmedi.
And then he started talking.	Soň bolsa gürläp başlady.
I haven't seen you since yesterday.	Düýn bäri seni görmedim.
Very strange.	Gaty geň.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
This is not really difficult.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn däl.
Maybe there is another way.	Belki başga bir ýol bar.
There is a reason for that.	Şonuň üçin munuň sebäbi bar.
I am you.	Men saňa.
Offers help.	Kömek etmegi teklip edýär.
This will happen soon.	Bu ýakyn wagtda bolar.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
He did it early.	Ol ir etdi.
He could not do anything about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat edip bilmedi.
We can't allow that.	Biz muňa rugsat berip bilmeris.
Of course, this was not the case before.	Elbetde, öň beýle däldi.
Australian time.	Awstraliýa wagty.
I don't think about the future.	Geljek hakda pikir etmeýärin.
This is for him.	Bu onuň üçin.
You have to do a good job with that.	Munuň bilen gowy iş etmeli.
We are not.	Biz beýle däl.
Not surprisingly.	Gaty geň zat ýok.
I need some help.	Biraz kömek isleýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şol wagt bu dogry ýol bolsa gerek.
You have to let it go.	Oňa rugsat bermeli.
You can't go anywhere	Hiç ýere gidip bolmaz
That's all.	Diňe şu.
You really are.	Siz hakykatdanam şeýle.
There is something really wrong.	Hakykatdanam erbet bir zat bar.
You have to get money.	Pul almaly.
If at all.	Asla bar bolsa.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
It wasn't like me.	Bu meniň ýaly däldi.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Men muny şeýle aýtmaly.
This is even better.	Bu hatda gowy.
Why should it be so difficult?	Näme üçin beýle kyn bolmaly?
I really have to go home.	Men hakykatdanam öýe gitmeli.
He does the right thing.	Dogry edýär.
It would be just like that.	Bu edil şu ýaly bolardy.
They are too many.	Olar gaty köp.
What a beautiful word.	Nähili owadan söz.
No one wanted him here.	Hiç kim ony bu ýerde islemedi.
Nothing like last time.	Soňky gezek ýaly zat ýok.
He did not say why.	Näme üçin ol aýtmady.
It's already beautiful.	Bu eýýäm owadan.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şeýle.
A few weeks, maybe.	Birnäçe hepde, belki.
His things must be there, somewhere.	Onuň zatlary şol ýerde, bir ýerde bolmaly.
Really	Hakykatdanam
He was with me all day.	Ol bütin gün meniň bilen boldy.
It was a great decision.	Bu ajaýyp karar boldy.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
I am very difficult.	Men gaty kyn.
It will come next time.	Indiki gezek geler.
I did the most.	Iň köp iş etdim.
He just does it for me.	Ol diňe meniň üçin edýär.
There, there.	Ol ýerde, şol ýerde.
That's a lot.	Bu gaty köp zat.
I want everyone to do this with me.	Her kimiň muny meniň bilen etmegini isleýärin.
He thinks about it.	Ol hakda pikir edýär.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I don't care.	Men bu barada alada etmeýärin.
I called	Men jaň etdim
I gave it to him.	Men oňa berdim.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe biri etmeli.
Not really young.	Dogry ýaş däl.
Two weeks ago.	Iki hepde öň.
He asked what to do.	Näme etmelidigini sorady.
I never thought.	Men hiç haçan pikir etmedim.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
There, somewhere.	Ol ýerde, bir ýerde.
I think he wanted to talk to me.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol meniň bilen gürleşmek isledi.
I think this is the only way.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýeke-täk ýol.
Now he understands.	Indi düşündi.
This is not true at all.	Bu asla dogry däl.
Everything was there.	Ol ýerde hemme zat bardy.
I also think this is a good thing.	Şeýle hem bu gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
It happened again this morning.	Şu gün irden ýene bir gezek boldy.
This is not the case at all.	Bu asla ýok.
A lot of trouble.	Köp kynçylyk.
I could not say anything.	Men hiç zat aýdyp bilmedim.
If not now.	Häzir däl bolsa.
I had to agree.	Men razy bolmaly boldum.
It was not for me.	Bu meniň üçin däldi.
He tells me things.	Ol maňa zatlar aýdýar.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
He wants to go.	Ol gitmek isleýär.
How it should be.	Bu nähili bolmaly.
I didn’t think it would be beautiful.	Men bu owadan bolar öýdemokdym.
He advised.	Ol maslahat berdi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
The man was very surprised.	Ol adam gaty geň galdy.
He seems to have done a great job.	Ol gaty gowy iş eden ýaly.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
No one answered.	Hiç kim jogap bermedi.
Longer, worse.	Uzak, has erbet.
Until then, you can buy it.	Oňa çenli, ony satyn alyp bilersiňiz.
I know about you	Men sen hakda bilýärin
In fact, there is nothing wrong with that.	Aslynda uly zat ýok.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
Where are they	Olar nirede.
In fact, he told me he wanted to rest.	Aslynda, maňa dynç almak isleýändigini aýtdy.
Everyone is doing something to relax.	Her kim dynç almak üçin bir zat edýär.
You will never be like us.	Sen hiç wagt biziň ýaly bolmaz.
Right now	Edil şu wagt.
I thought the food was great.	Nahar gaty gowy diýip pikir etdim.
Now he had everything.	Indi onuň hemme zady bardy.
It's early tomorrow.	Ertir iň ir.
It has nothing else to do.	Başga işi ýok.
That was right for him.	Bu onuň üçin dogry boldy.
Far-sightedness was no problem.	Uzak görmek hiç hili mesele däldi.
Another good person.	Başga bir gowy adam.
One day too many.	Bir gün gaty köp.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
There was no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
It takes a few steps to do that.	Munuň üçin birneme ýol gerek.
Tell me about it.	Maňa bu hakda aýdyň.
It's just meat.	Bu diňe et.
Impossible, but possible.	Mümkin däl, ýöne mümkin.
These are wonderful things.	Bu ajaýyp zatlar.
Maybe a few hours.	Belki birnäçe sagat.
May go tomorrow.	Ertir gidip biler.
He didn't have to do that.	Muny etmeli däldi.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
I don't want to hurt him.	Men oňa zyýan bermek islämok.
We have to go	Biz gitmeli
This is something else!	Bu başga bir zat!
At home in the morning.	Irden öýde.
Permission is a completely different matter.	Rugsat bermek düýbünden başga mesele.
It does not exist and never will.	Ol ýok we asla bolmaz.
I think he knew that.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny bilýärdi.
There was no such thing as them.	Olar ýaly zat ýokdy.
He had to give something.	Bir zat bermeli boldy.
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
.	.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
This is bad.	Bu erbet.
No one paid attention to me.	Hiç kim maňa üns bermedi.
What a job.	Bu nähili iş.
Of course I can agree.	Elbetde, razy bolup bilerin.
I just believe in myself.	Men diňe maňa ynanýaryn.
It is possible, but very likely.	Bu mümkin, ýöne gaty ähtimal.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç haçan dogry zat ýok.
Only one thing can happen, but one thing.	Diňe bir zat bolup biler, ýöne bir zat.
For this.	Munuň üçin.
In fact, it often happens the other way around.	Aslynda, köplenç başga ýol bilen bolýar.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Indi bu hakda gürleşmek islämok.
This is a question.	Bu sorag.
That's exactly what life has been like for the past two weeks.	Geçen iki hepde durmuş hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
Who are we and who are we?	Bu kim we biz.
A long way, of course.	Elbetde uzak ýol.
He didn't care.	Oňa alada etmedi.
He was not ready.	Ol taýyn däldi.
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däl.
It has to be better against it.	Oňa garşy has gowy bolmaly.
It's not bad, it's not bad.	Bu erbet däl, bu erbet däl.
I was so surprised today.	Bu gün gaty geň gördüm.

I'm not good anymore.	Men indi gowy däl.

And then he does the same thing.	Soň bolsa edil şol bir zady edýär.
It could be the same.	Şeýle hem bolup biler.
Not much.	Kän däl.
He didn't have time, he didn't want to know.	Wagty ýokdy, bilmek islemedi.
It won't be long.	Kän bir kän bolmaz.
This person is trying to help.	Bu adam kömek etjek bolýar.
It will take some time.	Oňa birneme wagt gerek bolar.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
Good things happen and bad things happen.	Gowy zatlar bolýar we erbet zatlar bolýar.
This is a difficult question.	Bu kyn sorag.
Bad thing.	Erbet zat.
I still want it.	Men henizem ony isleýärin.
She looks really beautiful.	Ol hakykatdanam owadan görünýär.
He said he wanted more.	Has köp zat isleýändigini aýtdy.
The meal was the same.	Nahar hem şeýle boldy.
He needs advice.	Oňa maslahat gerek.

No one else is offering such a thing.	Başga hiç kim munuň ýaly zady teklip etmeýär.
He can't go.	Ol gidip bilmeýär.

Maybe now I just want to have fun.	Belki, häzir diňe hezil etmek isleýärin.
One man could not do it alone.	Bir adam muny ýeke edip bilmedi.
It really helped us.	Bu hakykatdanam bize kömek etdi.
Not all the time.	Bütin wagt däl.
He asked for help.	Ol kömek sorady.

He did not say a word.	Ol hiç hili söz aýtmady.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet zat däl.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
I often think of you.	Men seni köplenç pikir edýärin.
You are not alone	Sen ýeke däl
He thought he couldn't sleep.	Ol uklap bilmeýär diýip pikir etdi.
A few tips can be given.	Birnäçe maslahat berip bolar.
There was this problem too.	Bu mesele hem bardy.
I'll call him.	Men oňa jaň ederin.
He called.	Ol jaň etdi.
Great, you're here.	Ajaýyp, sen şu ýerde.
I'm sure everything will be fine.	Hemme zadyň gowy boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýok.
You can do that.	Munuň üçin edip bilersiňiz.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, beýle däl.
I do not have.	Mende ýok.
Maybe he's still there.	Belki, ol henizem şol ýerde.
He never said or did anything.	Hiç haçan hiç zat aýtmady ýa-da hiç zat etmedi.
It would be nice to tell him.	Oňa aýtmak gowy bolardy.
Of course.	Elbetde.
This is what happened here.	Bu ýerde şeýle boldy.
In fact, it didn't take much.	Aslynda kän bir zat gerek däldi.
He told her the truth.	Ol oňa hakykaty aýtdy.
He seemed to need it.	Ol özüne mätäç ýalydy.
This song is great.	Bu aýdym ajaýyp.
There seems to be a problem.	Mesele bar ýaly.
I asked a question about it, but there was no answer.	Men bu barada sorag berdim, ýöne jogap ýok.
Many people.	Köp adam.
He really didn't exist.	Ol hakykatdanam ýokdy.
That's a big question.	Bu gaty sorag.
For a while he didn't bother.	Birneme wagt bäri ol muny biynjalyk etmedi.
It was great to do that.	Muny etmek gaty gowy boldy.
Which is great.	Haýsy ajaýyp.
Because there is a book for everyone there.	Sebäbi ol ýerde hemmeler üçin kitap bar.
Tom doesn't have to.	Tom hökman däl.
That is what happened.	Munuň özi şeýle boldy.
I was the only one there.	Men ol ýerde ýeke özüm boldum.
Then he had to worry about what had happened.	Soň bolsa bolup geçen zatlar hakda alada etmeli boldy.
I can do something.	Men bir zady edip bilerin.
I just think about it.	Men bu hakda diňe pikir edýärin.
There is always a good reason.	Elmydama gowy sebäp bar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Häzirki wagtda doly zat.
Everyone should agree.	Her kim razy bolmaly.
It says.	Bu aýdýar.
He wanted to get it.	Ol muny almak isledi.
Not at all.	Asla beýle zat däl.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
I do not have.	Mende ýok.
There was something.	Bir zat bardy.
I am very fast	Men gaty çalt
To be human.	Adam bolmak .
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
You don't have to answer.	Jogap bermeli däl.
I do not like	Men halamok
There was a girl.	Bir gyz bardy.
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
So it is not surprising to me.	Şonuň üçin bu meniň üçin geň däl.
I could do that.	Men muny edip bilýärdim.
This is not necessarily a good thing.	Bu hökman gowy zat däl.
The message has arrived.	Habar geldi.
Life is really beautiful.	Durmuş hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
He really wants me.	Ol meni hakykatdanam isleýär.
All he had to do was call.	Ol diňe jaň etmek üçin galdy.
He needs advice.	Oňa maslahat gerek.
This is permission.	Bu rugsat.
This is likely.	Bu ähtimal.
Do more.	Has köp zat et.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
It was another day.	Bu başga bir gün boldy.
He promised her.	Oňa söz berdi.
I admire him now.	Men oňa häzir haýran.
He did not call.	Ol jaň etmedi.
I just thought.	Men diňe pikir etdim.
The girl is impossible	Gyz mümkin däl
I'm sure that will be the case.	Edil şonuň ýaly boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
Such lies.	Munuň ýaly ýalan zatlar.
I do not agree with that.	Men muňa razy däl.
We fully agree.	Biz muňa doly razy.
Monday was a great day for me.	Duşenbe meniň üçin gaty gowy gün boldy.
I'm always scared	Men hemişe gorkýaryn.
Bad thing, it was fast.	Erbet, bu çalt boldy.
Of course we can do better, no?	Elbetde, has gowy edip bileris, ýok?
Maybe for a while.	Belki birneme wagt bolar.
This is a week ago today.	Bu bir hepde öň şu gün.
Three.	Üç.
They are the same.	Olar hem edil şonuň ýaly.
This seems to be a difficult issue.	Bu kyn mesele ýaly.
There is something here.	Bu ýerde bir zat bar.
He will.	Ol eder.
The watch will help.	Sagat kömek eder.
It's not easy to decide.	Karar bermek aňsat däl.
And then so be it.	Soň bolsa şeýle.
I am the police	Men polisiýa
She doesn't have to worry.	Ol alada etmeli däl.
She looked like a really nice and nice person.	Ol hakykatdanam owadan we gowy adam ýalydy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu uly zat.
That's right.	Dogry.
I don't do this last thing.	Men bu soňky zady etmeýärin.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
Still single.	Entek ýekeje.
A lot of work.	Köp iş.
This is a full day job.	Bu doly iş güni.
No one knows.	Muny hiç kim bilenok.
I never thought about it.	Men ol hakda hiç wagt pikir etmedim.
Of course not so hard.	Elbetde, beýle kyn däl.
It's easy to say.	Muny aýtmak aňsat.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
It seemed too far.	Bu gaty uzak ýalydy.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýok.
What happened yesterday	Düýn näme boldy.
"It simply came to our notice then.	Ol: "Gowy.
This is a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat.
I did it.	Men muny etdim.
He did no harm.	Ol hiç hili zyýan bermedi.
You are not serious.	Siz çynlakaý däl.
They are very good.	Olar gaty gowy.
There are several possibilities for this.	Munuň üçin birnäçe mümkinçilik bar.
There is no such person here.	Bu ýerde beýle adam ýok.
Now he wants to talk to us.	Indi ol ikimiz bilen gürleşmek isleýär.
I'm not worried.	Men birneme biynjalyk däl.
And then it happened.	Soň bolsa şeýle boldy.
These are two issues.	Bu iki mesele.
I don’t know why he would be there.	Näme üçin ol ýerde boljakdygyny bilemok.
I was not even human.	Men hatda adam däldim.
There is a problem here.	Bu ýerde bir mesele bar.
This is also possible.	Bu hem mümkin.
I exist for one thing and one thing only.	Men diňe bir zat we diňe bir zat üçin bar.
He helps me.	Ol maňa kömek edýär.
In fact, there was no other way.	Aslynda munuň üçin başga ýol ýokdy.
You know everything about me.	Sen meniň hakda hemme zady bilýärsiň.
It wasn't too much.	Gaty kän däldi.
This is good and bad.	Bu gowy we erbet.
Not at all next week.	Indiki hepde asla ýok.
I'm scared.	Men gorkýaryn.
There was nothing to worry about.	Alada etmeli zat ýokdy.
You have to go now.	Indi gitmeli.
This is not necessary.	Bu biraz gerek däl.
This seems strange.	Bu bir geň zat ýaly.
Not last night.	Düýn agşam däl.
He thinks he can do whatever he wants.	Islän zadyny edip biljekdigini pikir edýär.
Can't get here fast enough.	Bu ýere ýeterlik çalt baryp bilmeýär.
I have a lot of things like that.	Mende şeýle zatlar köp.
I was on the ground.	Men ýerde boldum.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu dogry zat we akylly zat.
Here we are now.	Ine, biz häzir.
I don't know what he thinks.	Men onuň näme pikir edýändigini bilemok.
Maybe that wasn’t good.	Belki bu gowy däldi.
Everyone knew about it.	Bu barada hemmeler bilýärdi.
He knew.	Ol bilýärdi.
Everyone wants to.	Her kim isleýär.
Not always easy.	Elmydama aňsat däl.
Everything looks so good.	Hemme zat gaty gowy görünýär.
He thought there must be a hundred people there.	Ol ýerde ýüz adam bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
It could be very close now.	Häzir gaty ýakyn bolup biler.
It was very frustrating.	Bu gaty biynjalyk boldy.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn.
I have	Mende bar.
You have to do everything right for you.	Hemme zady siziň üçin dogry etmeli.
He wants to do it.	Ol muny etmek isleýär.
I've seen it before.	Men ony eýýäm gördüm.
These things are not the same thing.	Bu zatlar bir zat däl.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
We are not.	Biz beýle däl.
So now you have to be that way.	Şonuň üçin indi sen şeýle bolmaly.
I'll take care of you	Men sen hakda alada ederin.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, etmeli bolardy.
This is not what he did.	Bu onuň eden zady däl.
He didn't think so.	Ol beýle pikir etmedi.
I'm just not doing anything.	Diňe hiç zat etmeýärin.
He couldn't tell her it wasn't crazy.	Oňa munuň däli däldigini aýdyp bilmedi.
It took a few days.	Birnäçe gün gerek boldy.
A few hours.	Birnäçe sagat.
They are not there.	Olar ol ýerde däl.
Of course I know something.	Elbetde, bir zadyň bardygyny bilýärin.
There seems to be only one way to do that.	Munuň üçin diňe bir ýol bar ýaly.
It was as if he didn't know it.	Ol muny bilmeýän ýalydy.
One word, only one word from you.	Bir söz, diňe senden bir söz.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, zatlar gyzykly bolýar.
Not now, one day.	Häzir däl, bir gün.
He does the same today.	Häzirki wagtda ol hem şeýle edýär.
It will not be difficult.	Bu kyn bolmaz.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde erbet zat ýokdy.
This is what happens.	Bu zatlar şeýle bolýar.
I don’t want to think about it until next week.	Geljek hepde çenli bu hakda pikir etmek islämok.
The new year is coming.	Täze ýyl gelýär.
He wants, he even wants.	Isleýär, hatda isleýär.
I think this is really serious.	Bu hakykatdanam çynlakaý diýip pikir edýärin.
Of course, talking is not easy.	Elbetde, gürleşmek aňsat däl.
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
I didn't think twice.	Iki gezek pikir etmedim.
I think it would be good.	Gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
He always says such good things about you.	Elmydama sen hakda şeýle gowy zatlar aýdýar.
The book bought it.	Kitap ony satyn aldy.
Probably not.	Belki, beýle bolmaz.
With that guy	Şol ýigit bilen.
You are not short either.	Sen hem gysga däl.
I saw it.	Men ony gördüm.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
It was very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly boldy.
The problem here is that everyone is different.	Bu ýerde mesele her kim başga.
What did he do there?	Ol ýerde näme etdi.
Making the right decision at the right time.	Dogry wagtda dogry karar bermek.
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
This is also the case.	Bu hem bolýar.
There	Şol ýerde.
I do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly edýärin.
I think there is something for that.	Meniň pikirimçe, munuň üçin bir zat bar.
Not much.	Kän däl.
Isn't that strange?	Bu geň dälmi?
He understood.	Ol düşündi.
really true	hakykatdanam gaty dogry.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
Everyone will think that the police are you.	Her kim, polisiýa özüňiz diýip pikir eder.
This was not the first time.	Bu hem ilkinji gezek däldi.
He told himself.	Ol özüne aýtdy.
He knew he wouldn't do it.	Etmejekdigini bilýärdi.
This time is different.	Bu wagt başga.
In fact, I do not believe it.	Aslynda men muňa ynanamok.
He behaved well.	Özüni gowy alyp bardy.
He did it.	Bu işi etdi.
At the time, it was almost impossible.	Şol wagt mümkin däl diýen ýaly.
I'd like to buy some.	Birneme satyn almak isleýärin.
Of course two.	Elbetde iki.
What not.	Näme däl.
This is crazy.	Bu däli.
There was something else.	Başga bir zat bardy.
He is not ready for that either.	Ol hem muňa taýyn däl.
There are also three books.	Şeýle hem üç kitap.
A lot of people, people.	Köp adam, adam.
In fact, I know nothing for me.	Aslynda meniň üçin bir zadyň ýokdugyny bilýärin.
I didn't do much.	Kän iş etmedim.
Not time.	Wagt däl.
He called the police.	Ol polisiýa jaň etdi.
He understood that.	Ol muňa düşündi.
You can do it elsewhere.	Başga bir ýerde edip bilersiňiz.
It can and will happen.	Bu bolup biler we bolar.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
That could be a problem.	Bu bir mesele bolup biler.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
It will take money.	Munuň üçin pul gerek bolar.
There is a way.	Bir ýol bar.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I didn't think, I didn't think.	Pikir etmedim, pikir etmedim.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle boldy.
I called home again and there was no answer.	Men ýene öýe jaň etdim, henizem jogap ýok.
He came to me, then he left.	Maňa geldi, soň gitdi.
These are two things.	Bu iki zat.
Maybe something else.	Belki başga bir zat bolup biler.
It doesn't help anyone.	Bu hiç kime kömek etmeýär.
He arrived this morning.	Ol şu gün irden geldi.
I don’t think about it every day right now.	Häzirki wagtda bu barada her gün pikir etmeýärin.
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
I don't think that's enough.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu iş ýeterlik däl ýaly.
There is the police.	Polisiýa bar.
I am a completely different person.	Men düýbünden başga adam.
This is not good at all.	Bu düýbünden gowy däl.
I wonder what this could be.	Munuň näme bolup biljekdigine haýran.
I don't think so.	Beýle edýär öýdemok.
They were there.	Olar bardy.
They really are.	Olar hakykatdanam.
He went there.	Ol şol ýere gitdi.
Once or twice, maybe more.	Bir ýa-da iki gezek, belki has köp.
I got everything.	Men hemme zady aldym.
I don't know how to do that.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilenok.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Where to go?	Nirä gitmeli?
I hope so for you.	Seniň üçin şeýle umyt edýärin.
And then.	Soň bolsa.
I must know that.	Men muny bilýän bolmaly.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
He does a few things.	Birnäçe zady edýär.
I think it's good.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol gowy.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
There seems to be no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýok ýaly.
You have to worry more.	Has köp alada etmeli.
Who knows what might happen.	Näme bolup biljekdigini kim bilýär.
There was good news there.	Ol ýerde gowy habar bardy.
There was something else.	Başga bir zat bardy.
Not complete yet.	Entek doly däl.
Now you can see it for yourself.	Indi muny özüňiz görüp bilersiňiz.
I was so bad.	Men gaty erbet boldum.
He must be with us.	Ol biziň bilen bolmaly.
He can tell.	Ol aýdyp biler.
There are more books.	Has köp kitap bar.
He was completely alone.	Ol düýbünden ýeke boldy.
I don't need it.	Maňa gerek däl.
There is another issue.	Başga bir mesele bar.
They were not enough.	Olar ýeterlik däldi.
I think that is absolutely true.	Meniň pikirimçe, düýbünden dogry.
Good.	Gowy.
Such a bad girl	Şeýle erbet gyz.
Nor is he alone.	Şeýle hem bu ýeke özi däl.
This is really good news.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp habar.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Actually a year.	Aslynda bir ýyl.
She was not a stupid young girl who knew nothing.	Ol hiç zady bilmeýän samsyk ýaş gyz däldi.
He may have already done that.	Ol muny eýýäm eden bolmagy mümkin.
And then no.	Soň bolsa ýok.
He never did that.	Hiç haçan beýle zat etmedi.
It will be next.	Indiki bolar.
I want someone	Men kimdir birini isleýärin
No longer available.	Indi mümkinçilik ýok.
There was something strange.	Geň bir zat bardy.
The best answer is to give it a try.	Iň gowy jogap, synap görmek.
This is a wonderful thing.	Bu gaty ajaýyp zat.
Strange, but not a big deal.	Geň, ýöne uly mesele däl.
He seemed stupid.	Ol samsyk ýalydy.
Of course, you have to do the same.	Elbetde, edil şonuň ýaly etmeli.
This is a problem.	Bu bir mesele.
I believe in him.	Men oňa ynanýaryn.
Many things are possible.	Köp zat mümkin.
A few other things, not many.	Başga birnäçe zat, kän däl.
This is really good news.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy habar.
I know this is not true.	Munuň dogry däldigini bilýärin.
OK, maybe not.	Bolýar, belki ýok.
No one else can do that.	Muny başga hiç kim edip bilmez.
We are happy.	Biz bagtly.
Not in a good place.	Gowy ýerde däl.
She doesn't know yet.	Ol entek bilenok.
We really are.	Biz hakykatdanam.
We are everything.	Biz hemme zat.
Everything was fine at the time.	Şol wagt hemme zat gowy boldy.
These are just things.	Bu diňe zatlar.
She was amazed.	Ol muňa haýran galdy.
Not in many words.	Kän söz bilen däl.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
It looks better.	Has gowy görünýär.
He has to give it tonight.	Ol şu gije bermeli.
It looks great.	Bu gaty gowy görünýär.
I have nothing to worry about.	Alada etjek zadym ýok.
"It's not a big deal," he said.	"Bu kän bir mesele däl" -diýdi.
It was no longer enough.	Indi ýeterlik däldi.
You are with me	Sen meniň bilen
I hope so.	Şeýle umyt edýärin.
I'm really good.	Men hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
That was not the case with me.	Bu meniň bilen beýle däldi.
He thought he wouldn't do it.	Ol muny etjek däl diýip pikir etdi.
If possible	Mümkin bolsa.
It is very difficult and difficult for me to know.	Men bilýän gaty kyn we kyn.
I'm fine.	Men gowy.
They are no more.	Olar indi ýok.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
He said it would be interesting.	Ol munuň gyzykly boljakdygyny aýtdy.
Have a great day here.	Bu ýerde gaty gowy gün.
Only better, better.	Diňe has gowy, has gowy.
I can get it	Men muny alyp bilerin
You are the only one	Sen ýeke-täk
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, asla beýle bolmaly däl.
Maybe an hour, a maximum.	Belki bir sagat, iň köp.
He stayed there.	Ol şol ýerde galdy.
I had to go home.	Men öýe gitmeli boldum.
I think it will be interesting.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gyzykly bolar.
So you don’t have to worry.	Şonuň üçin alada etmeli däl.
It was like a mess.	Bu gaty biynjalyk ýalydy.
You don’t even have to admit anything.	Hatda hiç zady boýun almaly däl.
I had fun.	Men hezil etdim.
I can hurt you.	Men saňa zyýan berip bilerin.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
I have to go	Men gitmeli
I think that's a lie.	Bu ýalan diýip pikir edýärin.
He made me so happy.	Ol meni şeýle bagtly etdi.
I don't want to	Men indi islämok
It could be.	Bolup biler.
It's easy and fast to do this.	Bu etmek aňsat we çalt bir zat.
He wanted to know everything about me.	Ol meniň hakda hemme zady bilmek isledi.
Just not close enough.	Diňe ýeterlik ýakyn däl.
There may be three.	Üç bolup biler.
You can call us.	Bize jaň edip bilersiňiz.
I think that's a good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat diýip pikir edýärin.
This girl.	Bu gyz.
This is good and true.	Bu gowy we dogry.
He knew he wanted to give her money.	Oňa pul bermek isleýändigini bilýärdi.
Maybe in the near future.	Belki ýakyn wagtda.
He came to pick me up.	Ol meni alyp gitmäge geldi.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
There are so many.	Ol ýerde gaty köp.
And then he was surprised.	Soň bolsa geň galdy.
In fact, it wasn't that bad for me.	Aslynda ol meniň üçin beýle erbet däldi.
Now he is back.	Indi ol ýene geldi.
So this idea is not surprising to me.	Şonuň üçin bu pikir meniň üçin geň däl.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
He is in a good place.	Ol gowy ýerde.
He does it all.	Ol hemmesini edýär.
You have to give him what he wants.	Oňa nädip isleýändigini bermeli.
I can recommend it to everyone.	Hemmeler üçin maslahat berip bilerin.
That could be good.	Bu gowy bolup biler.
We can only try.	Diňe synap bileris.
It was really good tomorrow.	Hakykatdanam, ertir gaty gowy boldy.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
You have to go.	Sen gitmeli.
OK, it wasn't.	Bolýar, beýle däldi.
One thing for sure.	Elbetde bir zat.
This is not an easy life.	Bu aňsat durmuş däl.
No one wants to.	Hiç kim islemeýär.
This is not really the case.	Bu hakykatdanam beýle däl.
Please.	Ine haýyş.
.	.
He took it upon himself.	Ony özüne aldy.
It took two years.	Iki ýyl gerek boldy.
I heard about it.	Men ol hakda eşitdim.
I can't do anything for you.	Men seni hiç zat edip bilemok.
He was nothing to her.	Ol onuň üçin hiç zat däldi.
I know he can.	Biljekdigini bilýärin.
Now tell me what happened.	Indi näme bolandygyny aýdyň.
I've been to this guy once.	Men bu ýigit bilen bir gezek boldum.
It may or may not help.	Bu kömek edip biler ýa-da bolmaz.
He came.	Ol geldi.
Such a decision is not against us.	Şeýle karar bize garşy däl.
Not a good way.	Gowy ýol däl.
Nothing bothered him.	Hiç zat ony biynjalyk etmedi.
You can call and see.	Jaň edip görüp bilersiňiz.
Of course it's gone.	Elbetde gitdi.
Someone must have seen this before.	Kimdir biri muny öň gören bolmaly.
He could not go at all.	Asla gidip bilmedi.
He was not good with it.	Ol munuň bilen gowy däldi.
This is a very serious matter.	Bu gaty çynlakaý zat.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
So this will not be the case.	Şonuň üçin bu mesele bolmaz.
There will be no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim bolmaz.
It took a long time.	Munuň üçin köp wagt gerek boldy.
I need money fast	Çalt pul gerek
I am nothing	Men hiç zat däl
It was decided to arrest me.	Meni tussag etmek üçin karar çykdy.
Maybe one day it will be.	Belki bir gün şeýle bolar.
I can't say.	Men aýdyp biljek däl.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
That would be great.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp bolar.
That may be enough for him.	Onuň üçin bu ýeterlik bolup biler.
He didn't pay attention to me.	Ol maňa üns bermedi.
That should be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolmaly.
This is not good for work.	Bu iş üçin gowy däl.
It may be possible.	Mümkin bolup biler.
Like a problem.	Kynçylyk ýaly.
You really need money to buy.	Hakykatdanam, satyn almak üçin pul gerek.
Then he understood me.	Soň maňa düşündi.
It can be made more beautiful if necessary.	Zerur bolsa, has owadan edip bolýar.
One day, one day.	Bir gün, bir gün.
I don't trust you anymore.	Indi saňa ynanamok.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
He was nowhere.	Ol hiç ýerde däldi.
Of course, this can be a good reason.	Elbetde, munuň üçin gowy sebäp bolup biler.
I still thought you were.	Men henizem sen diýip pikir etdim.
I bought it to try.	Muny synap görmek üçin satyn aldym.
It was new.	Bu täze boldy.
This is likely.	Bu ähtimal.
Now he couldn't help it.	Indi ol kömek edip bilmedi.
I couldn't get it anymore.	Men ony indi alyp bilmedim.
This last word is not a lie.	Bu soňky söz ýalan däl.
I don't think so.	Beýle bolar öýdemok.
You have no hope.	Size umyt ýok.
It wasn’t really that bad.	Aslynda beýle erbet däldi.
Mary would agree.	Merýem razy bolardy.
The question is how to do it.	Sorag muny nädip etmeli.
It always seems like a good year for something.	Elmydama bir zat üçin gowy ýyl bar ýaly.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
He was not just a good man.	Ol diňe gowy adam däldi.
I do a lot of things.	Men gaty köp zat edýärin.
I don't think so.	Bolmaly däl öýdýärin.
That day	Şol gün.
Two people came out.	Iki adam çykdy.
This is nothing.	Bu hiç zat däl.
You know it exists.	Onuň bardygyny bilýärsiň.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
Not just with money.	Diňe pul bilen däl.
No one but me knows this.	Munuň bardygyny menden başga hiç kim bilenok.
This is exactly the style of governing the country that he has used in Russia.	Bu adam hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
Good.	Gowy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle etmedi.
Not an adult.	Uly adam däl.
There is nothing better than to do.	Etmekden gowy zat ýok.
Oh! 	Aý!
He made her crazy.	Ony däli etdi.
You can get it.	Siz alyp bilersiňiz.
He can say whatever he wants.	Islän zadyny aýdyp biler.
Things get interesting here.	Bu ýerde zatlar gyzykly bolýar.
He could not agree.	Ol muňa razy bolup bilmedi.
Of course, this worries you.	Elbetde, bu sizi biynjalyk edýär.
I think that's right.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry.
Probably.	Mümkin.
No one thought, but it was.	Muny hiç kim pikir etmedi, ýöne şeýle boldy.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I don't think that's a bad idea.	Bu erbet pikir däl diýip pikir edýärin.
I know that is not the case.	Aslynda beýle däldigini bilýärin.
These things are very interesting.	Bu zatlar gaty gyzykly.
It will be the same.	Edil şeýle bolar.
It was fun.	Gyzykly boldy.
Bar.	Bar.
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
It was a wonderful night.	Ajaýyp gyzykly gije boldy.
You have what you want.	Seniň islän zadyň bar.
It can be very fast.	Bu gaty çalt bolup biler.
Everything.	Her bir zat.
Please help someone.	Kimdir biri oňa kömek etmegini haýyş edýärin.
This is not necessarily a bad thing.	Bu hökman erbet zat däl.
Enjoy a lot.	Köp lezzet almak.
This is the easiest.	Bu iň aňsat.
He gave it.	Ol muny berdi.
He could not do anything.	Hiç hili edip bilmedi.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
In addition.	Mundan başga.
Really on the ground.	Hakykatdanam ýere.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
How can this be done?	Muny nädip edip bolar?
The answer is complete and complete.	Jogap doly we doly.
I do it myself.	Men muny özüm edýärin.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolardy.
I'm not stupid	Men samsyk däl.
He knew something strange.	Geň bir zady bilýärdi.
Not somewhere.	Bir ýerde däl.
Bad, bad, very bad.	Erbet, erbet, gaty erbet.
I can take it once or twice.	Bir ýa-da iki gezek alyp bilerin.
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
The news made you anxious.	Habar sizi biynjalyk etdi.
That was not the question.	Bu sorag däldi.
Of course, this was not the case for me.	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin däldi.
Just for fun.	Diňe hezil üçin.
It seems impossible for us.	Biziň üçin mümkin däl ýaly bolup görünýär.
He knew he was still thinking about it.	Ol henizem bu hakda pikir edýändigini bilýärdi.
It's very easy to do that.	Muny etmek gaty aňsat.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
There should be only one reason.	Diňe bir sebäp bolmaly.
There was no one to bother me.	Meni biynjalyk etjek adam ýokdy.
Such a good idea.	Şeýle gowy pikir.
No news.	Habar ýok.
It will not be enough to do a good job.	Kän gowy iş etmek ýeterlik bolmaz.
A girl, maybe.	Bir gyz, belki.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
That's all we need.	Bize zerur zat.
Nothing will happen.	Bolmaly zatlar bolmaz.
I couldn’t say or do anything to make it right.	Dogry etmek üçin hiç zat aýdyp bilmedim ýa-da edip bilmedim.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
I need an answer.	Maňa jogap gerek.
Now it's hard to say.	Indi aýtmak kyn.
The easiest thing.	Iň aňsat mesele.
Only good or bad.	Diňe gowy ýa-da erbet.
He thought about it many times.	Ol bu barada köp gezek pikir etdi.
Not only that.	Diňe beýle däl.
I was the first to report this.	Men muny ilkinji bolup habar berdim.
He said.	Ol aýtdy.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
He hadn't gone far yet.	Ol entek uzak gidip bilmedi.
More people did.	Has köp adam etdi.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolardy.
I don't want to	Men indi islämok
Then he called again.	Soň ýene jaň etdi.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolmaz.
Meat is easy.	Et aňsat.
It looked really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy ýalydy.
That's the way it is with me.	Ine, meniň bilen şeýle.
Maybe he will do it now.	Belki, häzir eder.
Life was too short.	Durmuş gaty gysga boldy.
Not bad, just another.	Erbet däl, diňe başga.
Something else will happen after that.	Mundan soň başga bir zat bolar.
I found this very interesting.	Men muny gaty gyzykly gördüm.
That's what happened.	Ine, ol şeýle boldy.
Okay.	Bolýar.

This is a wonderful day.	Bu ajaýyp gün geldi.
This is a job.	Bu bir iş.
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
For two weeks off.	Iki hepde dynç almak üçin.
That must be true.	Bu dogry bolmaly.
He came to help.	Ol kömek etmek üçin geldi.
OK, OK.	Bolýar, bolýar.
Good.	Gowy.
There was nothing, but there was something.	Bir zat ýokdy, ýöne bir zat bardy.
Destroy it all.	Hemmesini ýok et.
Here is a way.	Ine bir ýol.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
I think you have to do it now.	Meniň pikirimçe, muny indi etmeli.
Maybe he knows something.	Belki, bir zady biler.
You have to go	Sen gitmeli
These are good things.	Bu gowy zatlar.

He came back to me.	Ol maňa gaýdyp geldi.
It will be good tomorrow.	Ertir gowy bolar.
It will always be interesting.	Elmydama gyzykly bolar.
I can't think of that.	Men beýle pikir edip bilemok.
Well, you're good.	Gowy, sen gowy.
One day is enough each month.	Her aý bir gün ýeterlik.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu men bolmaly.
I still think it's a bad idea.	Men henizem erbet pikir diýip pikir edýärin.
He allowed us to.	Ol bize ýol berdi.
I'm sure he will.	Etjekdigine ynanýaryn.
Life was hard.	Durmuş kyn boldy.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
I have to tell him.	Men oňa aýtmaly.
I saw it.	Men ony gördüm.
He asked for a big time.	Uly wagt sorady.
He couldn't do enough.	Ol ýeterlik edip bilmedi.
We are.	Biz.
We are with them.	Biz olar bilen.
It will be at home tomorrow.	Ertir öýde bolar.
Not good at all.	Asla gowy däl.
No way.	Bolmaz.
I was with him.	Men onuň bilen bir boldum.
It's worse.	Ol has erbet.
The question is not about us.	Sorag biz hakda däl.
I hope not.	Bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
No one can do that.	Muny hiç kim edip bilmez.
She is smart.	Ol akylly.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde erbet zat ýokdy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ol indi sebäp boldy.
Everything for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin hemme zat.
Stop now	Indi bes et.
I'm crazy about you	Men saňa däli.
I hope he does well.	Gowy eder diýip umyt edýärin.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle.
This is true for everyone today.	Bu häzirki wagtda hemmeler üçin dogry.
There! 	Ol ýerde!

He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
I will always be with you.	Men hemişe siziň bilen bolaryn.
He called the police and arrived immediately.	Ol polisiýa jaň etdi we derrew geldi.
Oh, that's good.	Aý, bu gowy.
It will be interesting too.	Bu hem gyzykly bolar.
He did not promise.	Ol söz bermedi.
Often he was not at home.	Köplenç ol öýde däldi.
It's tomorrow.	Ertir geldi.
It's as if he doesn't know if this can go away, but one way or another.	Munuň gidip biljekdigini bilmeýän ýaly, ýöne bir ýol.
He is no more.	Ol indi ýok.
What a guy.	Nähili ýigit.
This can take several days.	Bu birnäçe gün alyp biler.
It would be great to see that.	Muny görmek gaty gowy bolardy.
Everything but me.	Menden başga hemme zat.
Not so.	Şeýle hem däl.
The meal was good.	Nahar gowy boldy.
There was also no one to think about it.	Şeýle hem bu hakda pikir etjek adam ýokdy.
She wants to enjoy it.	Ol lezzet almak isleýär.
Too much, he could say.	Gaty köp, ol aýdyp biler.
The two are completely different.	Ikisi düýbünden başga.
Not for two years now.	Indi iki ýyl däl.
Not really.	Aslynda däl.
You are a good person	Sen gowy adam
Maybe that wasn’t right.	Belki, bu dogry däldi.
This is already great.	Bu eýýäm ajaýyp.
I can see now.	Men şu wagt görüp bilýärin.
No need to worry.	Alada etmegiň sebäbi ýok.
I don't know.	Bilmeýän.
I think you are very stupid.	Meniň pikirimçe, sen gaty samsyk.
This is an interesting question.	Bu gyzykly sorag.
It helps a lot.	Ol gaty kömek edýär.
He was a little surprised.	Ol birneme geň galdy.
We do not agree with that.	Biz muňa razy däl.
Something good about him this year.	Bu ýyl ol hakda bir zat gowy.
I do not believe so.	Men beýle ynanamok.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Gaty dogry sorag.
He looks like a good man.	Gowy adam ýaly bolup görünýär.
I advised him not to.	Etmezligi maslahat berdim.
I'm not sure he'll do that again.	Men onuň ýene şeýle etjekdigine ynanamok.
It should not be too difficult to know.	Muny bilmek gaty kyn bolmaly däl.
This is not really a problem.	Bu hakykatdanam kynçylyk däl.
I couldn't really tell.	Aslynda aýdyp bilmedim.
He is for me.	Ol meniň üçin.
I'll be early.	Men has ir bolaryn.
You know, for me.	Bilýärsiň, meniň üçin.
It's easy.	Aňsat zat.
You need it now.	Size şu wagt gerek.
He came immediately.	Derrew geldi.
He went to her.	Ol oňa gitdi.
The sun has risen.	Gün çykdy.
That's fine with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
He is very human.	Ol gaty adam.
It can't be that way.	Ol beýle bolup bilmez.
Not here.	Bu ýerde ýok.
I don't know how.	Men nädip bilemok.
It should never be.	Hiç haçan bolmaly däl.
It will be difficult to decide.	Karar bermek kyn bolar.
Now there may be a problem.	Indi bir mesele bolup biler.
There was something about it.	Bu barada bir zat bardy.
He didn't want one either.	Ol hem birini islemedi.
Great day	Ajaýyp gün.

He has done many things now.	Köp zatlary indi etdi.
The girl was alone.	Gyz ýeke boldy.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.

He went there and went quickly.	Ol ýerde we edil çalt gitdi.
This is not really a bad thing.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet däl.
I was so stupid.	Men şeýle samsyk boldum.
No one knows for sure.	Munuň üçin hiç bir adam bilmeýär.
They are just like us.	Olar hem biziň ýaly.
Okay, another one.	Bolýar, ýene biri.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
I didn't see anyone with him.	Men onuň bilen hiç kimi görmedim.

I told her I needed help.	Men oňa kömek etmelidigini aýtdym.
It will be too.	Bu hem bolar.
I think it takes time.	Meniň pikirimçe wagt gerek.
The first two years have always been the hardest.	Ilkinji iki ýyl hemişe iň kyn boldy.
This could not have been true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmedi.
He is not such a person.	Ol beýle adam däl.
There must be someone else.	Başga biri bolmaly.

Everything is strange.	Hemme zat geň.
This is very bad news.	Bu gaty erbet habar.

You have to get everything right.	Hemme zady dogry almaly.
He wants an answer right away.	Derrew jogap isleýär.
It's back.	Gowy gaýdyp geldi.
I don't think many people think so.	Köp adam beýle pikir etmeýär öýdýän.
The time was short.	Wagt gysga boldy.
He will call one last time.	Soňky gezek jaň eder.
This is a great job.	Bu ajaýyp iş.
There is always another way.	Elmydama başga ýol bar.
He is not there yet.	Ol entek ýok.

This work is very difficult.	Bu iş gaty kyn.
It helped a lot.	Bu gaty köp kömek etdi.

He did it here.	Bu ýerde etdi.

You can give me one.	Maňa birini berip bilersiňiz.
It was so bad.	Bu gaty erbet boldy.

Of course, this is a serious matter.	Elbetde, bu çynlakaý mesele.

That's what happened to me.	Meniň üçin ol şeýle boldy.
There was something there.	Ol ýerde bir zat bardy.
This is crazy.	Bu däli.

This is a very good person.	Bu gaty gowy adam.
Everything is very fast.	Hemme zat gaty çalt.
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.

Here's what you need to do	Ine, sen etmeli
It will not happen again.	Indi beýle bolmaz.

Life seemed wonderful.	Durmuş ajaýyp ýalydy.

This seemed unlikely.	Bu ähtimal däl ýalydy.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
It was not always a lie.	Elmydama ýalan däldi.
It's always easy with someone else.	Başga biri bilen elmydama aňsat.
I don't care about a person.	Men bir adam hakda alada etmeýärin.
I haven't thought about it for a long time.	Bu hakda köp wagt bäri pikir etmedim.
For me.	Meniň üçin.
Bar.	Bar.

Someone was stupid.	Kimdir biri samsyk boldy.

This morning	Bu irden.
Everything was still there, no one.	Hemme zat henizem bardy, hiç kim ýokdy.

Similarly, he is gone.	Edil şonuň ýaly, ol gitdi.
He answered.	Ol jogap berdi.
He could see it all.	Ol hemmesini görüp bilýärdi.

And then he said he didn't want to.	Soň bolsa islemeýändigini aýtdy.
And then he did.	Soň bolsa etdi.

I want to be happy.	Men bagtly bolmak isleýärin.
Not two.	Iki däl.
He doesn't want to go home.	Öýüne gitmek islemeýär.
This was my first concern.	Bu ilkinji alada boldy.
You should never think so.	Hiç wagt beýle pikir etmeli däl.
If so, he probably knows everything.	Şeýle bolsa, hemme zady bilýän bolsa gerek.
Good.	Gowy.
That's how I called you most of the time.	Men saňa köplenç şeýle jaň etdim.
I hoped he would.	Men şeýle eder diýip umyt etdim.
Yesterday, he did just that.	Düýn, edil şeýle etdi.

The problem.	Mesele.
And it will be an interesting time.	We gyzykly wagt bolar.

He knew he knew.	Bilýändigini bilýärdi.
This is a bit new.	Bu birneme täze.
I didn't have to do that.	Men muny etmeli däldim.
A girl can definitely do something with it.	Bir gyz hökman munuň bilen bir zat edip biler.
He must have seen it.	Ol muny gören bolmaly.
He is not stupid.	Ol samsyk däl.
Not very interesting.	Kän gyzykly däl.

It may be possible.	Mümkinçilik bolup biler.
You are close	Siz ýakyn.
Nothing happened.	Hiç zat ýokdy.
Do it yourself.	Muny özüňiz et.
Then the sound came again.	Soň ses ýene geldi.
I thought she was beautiful.	Men owadan diýip pikir etdim.
There is no right or wrong.	Dogry ýa-da ýalňyşlyk ýok.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
In fact, I couldn't think of anything better.	Aslynda has gowy zat hakda pikir edip bilmedim.

That's what he did.	Bu onuň eden zady.
No one spoke.	Hiç kim söz aýtmady.
There seemed to be no hope at all.	Asla umyt ýok ýalydy.
Only no one can do that.	Diňe muny hiç kim edip bilmez.
You can see the problem again.	Meseläni ýene bir gezek görüp bilersiňiz.
I gave everything.	Men hemme zady berdim.
Of course, I don't believe it.	Elbetde, men oňa ynanamok.
The problem is, we can't do it.	Kynçylyk, edip bilmeris.
He is ready for it.	Ol muňa taýyn.
That idea didn't really help.	Bu pikir hakykatdanam kömek etmedi.
He didn't say much.	Ol kän zat aýtmady.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.

He came home and called me.	Öýüne geldi we maňa jaň etdi.
And many.	We köp.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.

You only	Sen diňe
I did it alone.	Men muny ýeke etdim.

Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Bolmagy gaty bagtly bolsa gerek.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
It gets shorter, even.	Has gysga bolýar, hatda.
They weren't even close.	Olar hatda ýakyn hem däldi.

This will be the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek bolar.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Bu ýerde edip biljek zady ýokdy.
It’s not a bit of a hassle.	Bu birneme biynjalyk däl.
He never comes home.	Ol hiç wagt öýe gelenok.
The first two books were so interesting.	Ilkinji iki kitap şeýle gyzykly boldy.

I think that made him crazy.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ony däli etdi.
So you have to make the right decision.	Şonuň üçin dogry karar bermeli.
It just won't happen.	Bu diňe bolmaz.
It tells you a lot.	Bu size köp zady aýdýar.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I don't want to hurt you.	Men saňa hiç hili zyýan bermek islämok.
This is now possible.	Bu indi mümkin bolup biler.
He had another job.	Başga bir işi bardy.
He did not say anything about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat aýtmady.
They are very fast.	Olar gaty çalt.
I can't say it out loud.	Men muny gaty ses bilen aýdyp bilemok.
He just didn't do it.	Diňe beýle etmedi.
He must have thought about you.	Ol sen hakda pikir eden bolmaly.
It just doesn't work.	Diňe hiç hili işi ýok.
He did not say that, but he did not.	Ol muny aýtmady, ýöne hökman däldi.
That's great.	Ine, gaty gowy.
He can see.	Ol görüp bilýär.
Now the fastest.	Indi iň çalt.
Another quick question.	Başga bir çalt sorag.
How could he not?	Nädip edip bilmedi?
There is damage everywhere.	Hemme ýerde zyýan bar.
Everything was still there.	Hemme zat henizem bardy.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
Not about that.	Bu hakda däl.
I didn't know, I never wanted a girl.	Bilmedim, hiç haçan gyz islemedim.
Can anyone help me?	Maňa kömek edip biljek barmy?
Where is the damage?	Zyýan nirede?
He had to do something.	Ol bir zatlar etmeli boldy.
This is nothing new.	Bu täze zat däl.
It was clear.	Bu aýdyň boldy.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
They just don’t exist.	Olar diňe ýok.
One, two, three.	Bir, iki, üç.
Of course, now he is also very busy.	Elbetde, indi ol hem gaty meşgul.
It was like that.	Ol şeýle bir ýalydy.
Everything looks good.	Hemme zat gowy görünýär.
It can be seen.	Muny görüp bolýar.
I am the same.	Men edil şol bir.
He did what he knew.	Ol bilýän zadyny etdi.

Rest is bad.	Dynç almak erbet.
This is bad.	Bu erbet.
Not as before.	Öňküsi ýaly däl.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
No suggestions.	Hiç hili teklip ýok.
Of course, there is nothing new about this.	Elbetde, bu barada täze zat ýok.
I'm here for you right now.	Men şu wagt siziň üçin boldum.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
This is really different.	Bu hakykatdanam başga.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He has nothing to say.	Onuň aýdyp biljek zady ýok.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
Just seeing everything.	Diňe hemme zady görmek.
I can't go to the police	Polisiýa baryp bilemok
Wonderful madman.	Ajaýyp däli.
I want to.	Men isleýärin .
I think that's a good thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy iş.
In fact, this is often the case.	Hakykatdanam, bu köp gezek dogry.
I thought it was too much.	Bu gaty köp ýalydy öýdüpdim.
An hour, then two.	Bir sagat, soň iki.
Of course, one is a very bad thing.	Elbetde, biri gaty erbet iş.
She is not beautiful.	Ol owadan däl.
OK, another time.	Bolýar, başga bir gezek.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
It seemed good to him.	Bu oňa gowy ýalydy.
This is a great idea.	Bu ajaýyp pikir.
He calls me.	Ol maňa jaň edýär.
It could be something else.	Bu başga bir zat bolup biler.
There was the same problem.	Şol bir mesele bardy.
He didn't think about what he wanted.	Ol isleýän zady hakda pikir etmedi.
He wanted to talk about it.	Ol bu hakda gürleşmek isledi.
No time now.	Indi wagt ýok.
He stayed there for a few days.	Ol birnäçe gün şol ýerde galdy.
Nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýok.
There was no one else there.	Ol ýerde başga hiç kim ýokdy.
It's too fast.	Ol gaty çalt.
This is smart.	Bu akylly.
It was nothing.	Bu hiç zat däldi.
The time has come.	Wagt geldi.
He said it was not.	Ol beýle däldigini aýtdy.
No calls.	Jaň ýok.
That's right- this is not about me.	Hakykatdanam, bu dogry.
Because it's not me.	Sebäbi bu men däl.
I can't see it	Men muny görüp bilemok
You can do that at that time.	Şol wagt edip bilersiňiz.
It didn't work out.	Islän zady bolup bilmedi.
Stupid stupid to make me think that way.	Samsyk samsyk meni beýle pikir etmek üçin.
He just knows it happened.	Munuň bolandygyny diňe bilýär.
Very stupid.	Gaty samsyk.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
It's good, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Gowy "-diýdi.
You have to pay attention.	Üns bermeli.

For good reason.	Gowy sebäp bilen.
It will be better tomorrow.	Ertir has gowy bolar.

This is very serious.	Bu gaty çynlakaý.

Money is there.	Pul ol ýerde.
How good it must be.	Nädip gowy bolmaly.

Very good.	Gaty gowy.
I did something for him.	Men oňa bir zat etdim.
It was not just a life.	Bu diňe bir durmuş däldi.
I don't need it.	Maňa gerek bolmaz.
I don't want to think about it.	Bu hakda pikir etmek islämok.
The new day has come.	Täze gün geldi.
This is not the case.	Bu iş däl.
I'm not bad.	Men erbet däl.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.

Not always, but it happened.	Hemişe däl, ýöne boldy.
He gave a lot to her.	Ol onuň üçin köp zat berdi.

This is very difficult.	Munuň özi gaty kyn.
Surprisingly, he is right.	Geň zat, ol dogry aýdýar.

I know a lot about a lot of things.	Köp zatlar hakda gaty gowy bilýän.
You have to tell him and you have to tell him now.	Oňa aýtmaly we indi aýtmaly.
Of course it was good.	Elbetde gowy boldy.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
He will take care of you.	Ol size alada eder.
"I am more than you are," he said.	Ol: "Men senden has köp" diýdi.
Present and future.	Häzirki we geljek.
I did not know.	Men bilmedim.
It's a good thing to be happy.	Bagtly bolmak gaty gowy zat.
He said it was good for you.	Ol siziň üçin gowy diýdi.
This is a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele.
I'll do it somewhere else.	Men muny başga bir ýerde ederin.
He did nothing.	Hiç zat etmedi.
He was right.	Ol dogry aýtdy.
He tried to help her.	Oňa kömek etjek boldy.
He understood now.	Ol indi düşündi.
Not tonight.	Bu gije däl.
How good it was.	Bu nähili gowy boldy.
He just did what he wanted to do.	Ol diňe etjek bolýan zadyny etdi.
I didn't want to be like that.	Men beýle bolmak islemedim.
I don't think so yet.	Meniň pikirimçe, entek ýokdy.
It looks good, but it's just an idea.	Gowy görünýär, ýöne bu diňe pikir.
You have to allow it.	Munuň üçin rugsat bermeli.
There is only one way to do that.	Munuň üçin ýekeje ýol bar.
He actually said it for himself.	Aslynda muny özi üçin aýtdy.
No one but me.	Menden başga hiç kim däl.
Too many questions, not enough answers.	Gaty köp sorag, ýeterlik jogap ýok.

I can do it well.	Ony gowy edip bilerin.
This is not a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk däl.

No one reported.	Hiç kim habar bermedi.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
Life is busy.	Durmuş meşgul bolýar.
It is impossible to know.	Muny bilmek mümkin däl.
He is the only one.	Ol ýeke-täk.
No one can oppose it.	Hiç kim muňa garşy bolup bilmez.
He is nothing to me.	Ol meniň üçin hiç zat däl.
The new year will be better.	Täze ýyl has gowy bolar.
We can't talk here.	Biz bu ýerde gürläp bilmeris.
And that’s a wonderful thing.	Şeýle hem, bu ajaýyp bir zat.
And with you.	We seniň bilen.
Maybe so.	Belki düýbünden şeýle.

There was no one there but me.	Ol ýerde menden başga hiç kim ýokdy.
I didn’t want to see that anymore.	Men muny indi görmek islemedim.
Of course, he didn't want to talk about it.	Elbetde, bu hakda gürleşmek islemedi.
You are very good	Siz gaty gowy
Nothing will be good anymore.	Hiç zat indi gowy bolmaz.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
Like life.	Durmuş ýaly.
I can't be like that again.	Men ýene beýle bolup bilemok.
It's full.	Bu doly.
I don't like it at all	Men muny asla halamok
Of course he is with you.	Elbetde, ol seniň bilen.
Three years ago and now.	Üç ýyl ozal we indi.
This is not a new issue.	Bu täze mesele däl.
Maybe very serious.	Belki gaty çynlakaý.
Enough once.	Bir gezek ýeterlik.
He did it himself.	Muny özi etdi.
He fully understood.	Ol doly düşündi.
This is a very difficult decision.	Bu gaty kyn karar.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
I could not answer.	Men jogap berip bilmedim.
You can go now.	Indi gidip bilersiňiz.
I still believe it.	Men henizem ynanýaryn.
You can see it now.	Häzirki wagtda muny görüp bilersiňiz.
It would be great for that.	Ol munuň üçin ajaýyp bolardy.
Hope for like two weeks.	Iki hepde ýaly umyt.
There was something else.	Başga bir zat bardy.
I'm really sorry for you.	Aslynda saňa gynanýaryn.
So there is no problem here.	Şonuň üçin bu ýerde hiç hili mesele ýok.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
There must be one or the other.	Bir ýa-da başga bir zat bolmaly.
This has never been the case before.	Ozal beýle asla beýle däldi.
We are not smart enough.	Biz ýeterlik akylly däl.
I can't see it here.	Men bu ýerde görüp bilemok.
To see	Görmek üçin.
You have to answer that.	Muňa jogap bermeli.
It seemed to happen.	Bolýan ýalydy.
In fact, they are not the same thing.	Aslynda olar bir zat däl.
He always knew that.	Ol muny hemişe bilýärdi.
Of course.	Elbetde .
To no one	Hiç kime.
Tom didn't care anymore.	Tom indi alada etmedi.
Must admit.	Boýun almaly.
It was really fast.	Bu hakykatdanam çalt boldy.
Maybe very good.	Belki gaty gowy.
He is still with us.	Ol henizem biziň bilen.
That's fine with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy.
He didn't say anything to me.	Ol maňa hiç zat aýtmady.
It's just weird.	Bu diňe geň.
It takes a decision.	Munuň üçin karar gerek.
Good.	Gowy.
What you really need.	Hakykatdanam zerur zatlar.
I am a very bad person	Men gaty erbet adam
It's not hard to see.	Muny görmek kyn däl.
Now he has something else.	Häzirki wagtda onuň başga bir zady bar.
He is always close to us.	Ol elmydama bize ýakyn.
He never wanted to pay that much.	Ol hiç wagt beýle köp pul bermek islemedi.
This is not the same.	Bu bir däl.
What a week.	Näme hepde.
Good job	Gowy iş.
He began to worry.	Ol özüni biynjalyk edip başlady.
This should be done immediately.	Bu derrew etmeli.
Always in the right place.	Elmydama dogry ýerde.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
They are very difficult, which is good.	Olar gaty kyn, bu gowy.
Life is great.	Durmuş gaty gowy.
That's all we need.	Bu bize gerek zat.
Now someone wanted to say it again.	Indi kimdir biri muny ýene aýtmak isledi.
It just doesn't have to be that way.	Diňe beýle bolmaly däl.
I do well.	Men gowy edýärin.
This is for someone else.	Bu başga biri üçin.
I allowed the police to call.	Men polisiýa jaň etmäge mümkinçilik berdim.
This is a serious mistake.	Bu çynlakaý ýalňyşlyk.
Nothing good can happen.	Gowy hiç zat bolup bilmez.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň zat.
It would be nice to be home.	Öýde bolmak gowy bolardy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu dogry däldi.
What a great help they are.	Olar nähili uly kömek.
They really did exist.	Olar hakykatdanam bardy.
I am not.	Men däl .
It looks really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy ýaly.
It's too fast.	Bu gaty çalt.
Nothing, but everything is there.	Hiç zat ýok, ýöne hemme zat bar.
This guy never did the right thing.	Bu ýigit hiç wagt dogry zat etmedi.
You will need a book to answer it well.	Oňa ýeterlik jogap bermek üçin kitap gerek bolar.
He comes every day.	Ol her gün gelýär.
He told me he had to call.	Ol maňa jaň etmelidigini aýtdy.
Good and good things.	Gowy we gowy zatlar.
There is only one thing left.	Diňe bir zat galdy.
Not true, but there is.	Dogry däl, ýöne bar.
I'm just thinking about it now.	Men indi diňe bu hakda pikir edýärin.
You don't have to say that.	Munuň ýaly zatlary aýtmaly däl.
This is a very difficult task.	Bu gaty kyn iş.
At the moment.	Häzirki wagtda.
Of course, this was not easy at all.	Elbetde, bu asla aňsat däldi.
Of course, it will come soon.	Elbetde, ýakyn wagtda geler.
He never said it would be easy.	Munuň aňsat boljakdygyny hiç wagt aýtmady.
For me	Meniň üçin
Tonight would be the best.	Bu gije iň gowy bolardy.
This is a completely different problem.	Bu düýbünden başga kynçylyk.
He came out alone.	Ol ýeke-täk çykdy.
Just one year, maybe two.	Diňe bir ýyl, belki iki.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hem bir iş.
Everything looks good to me.	Hemme zat maňa gowy görünýär.
Where is life?	Durmuş nirede.
How? 	Nädip?
This did not happen.	Bu bolup bilmedi.
Thought about me.	Men hakda pikir.
The best thing that can happen.	Bolup biljek iň gowy zat.
Life is too short.	Durmuş gaty gysga.
This is someone who doesn't know.	Bu, bilmeýän biri.
Like two weeks.	Iki hepde ýaly.
And for some as a baby gets older, he or she will outgrow this.	Başga biri üçin bolsa has gyzykly.
I think that's a good idea.	Bu gaty gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin.
He said it was good.	Ol gowy diýdi.
The next question was, why was it after me.	Indiki sorag, näme üçin menden soň boldy.
It can't do anything.	Bu hiç zat edip bilmez.
If anyone can, we can.	Kimdir biri edip bilýän bolsa, edip bileris.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, munuň sebäbi.
Today was not a bad day.	Bu gün erbet gün däldi.
Other things can happen.	Başga zatlar bolup biler.
This is great for anyone.	Bu hem biri üçin ajaýyp.
This year is the first.	Bu ýyl ilkinji.
This is something new for me.	Bu meniň üçin täze zat.
He said it was not just him.	Ol munuň diňe özi däldigini aýtdy.
This can be a problem.	Bu bir kynçylyk bolup biler.
This is very worrying.	Bu gaty biynjalyk.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
I hope it will be good.	Gowy bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
I even told her about you.	Men hatda oňa sen hakda aýtdym.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
You really aren't.	Siz hakykatdanam beýle däl.
Now he knows what to do.	Indi näme etmelidigini bilýär.
That would be great fun.	Bu gaty gyzykly bolardy.
This gave him hope.	Bu oňa umyt berdi.
Long, long	Uzak, uzak
He will not need it.	Oňa zerur bolmaz.
He is here. "	Ol şu ýerde "diýip pikir etdi.
All you have to do now is work.	Häzirki wagtda diňe işi etmeli.
It was fast.	Ol çalt boldy.
You just know.	Siz diňe bilýän.
In fact, it was.	Aslynda bu boldy.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
He is a really good guy.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy ýigit.
Because you know.	Sebäbi bilýärsiň.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
Oh no, that can only be bad.	Aý ýok, bu diňe erbet bolup biler.
Something was wrong with him.	Onuň bilen bir zat dogry däldi.
I'm afraid of you	Men senden gorkýaryn.
No one else could get it.	Başga hiç kim alyp bilmedi.
I got a lot.	Men köp zat aldym.
It turned out.	Bu çykdy.
I want to see you there.	Seni ol ýerde görmek isleýärin.
That's a lot.	Bu köp boldy.
It should be the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly bolmaly.
Complete error.	Doly ýalňyşlyk.
I know, just weird things.	Bilýän, diňe geň zatlar.
Good for him because no one else likes him.	Onuň üçin gowy, sebäbi başga hiç kim ony halamaýar.
How does he know?	Ol nädip bilýär?
Nothing was right.	Hiç zat dogry däldi.
He reported that he had.	Ol bolandygyny habar berdi.
I have to help.	Men kömek etmeli.
The question is how.	Sorag nädip.
It was a great day.	Bu ajaýyp gün boldy.
Good.	Gowy.
Only you, here and now.	Diňe sen bar, şu ýerde we häzir.

He agreed and allowed it.	Ol muňa razy boldy we oňa ýol berdi.

There is still a problem.	Entek bir mesele galdy.
The night will definitely be good.	Gije hökman gowy bolar.
How is that even possible?!.	Bu hatda nädip mümkin?!.
Not everyone was so happy.	Hemmeler beýle bir bagtly däldi.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
Even the police couldn't help me.	Hatda polisiýa maňa kömek edip bilmedi.
Not a thing.	Bir zat däl.
I'm here for him.	Men onuň şu ýerde, bir ýerde.
They are nothing to me.	Olar meniň üçin hiç zat däl.
He always wants me.	Ol meni hemişe özi isleýär.
We must destroy it.	Biz ony ýok etmeli.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
He was not either.	Ol hem däldi.
This is my first.	Bu meniň ilkinji.
It was not very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly däldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gaty geň, bu iş.
This is a new life.	Bu täze durmuş.
They are not just for me.	Olar diňe meniň üçin däl.
He said he did not want to see you again tonight.	Ol şu gije seni ýene görmek islemeýändigini aýtdy.
Very necessary.	Gaty zerur.
Of course, this was not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däldi.

Too many ways.	Gaty köp ýol.
No one did it to him.	Hiç kim oňa muny etmedi.

This is not a guy.	Bu ýigit däl.
He knows that.	Muny bilýär.
Three weeks left.	Üç hepde galdy.
You don't have to agree.	Razy bolmak hökman däl.
You can be.	Siz bolup bilersiňiz.
He had to do something.	Ol bir zatlar etmeli boldy.
There was no sound anywhere.	Hiç ýerde ses ýokdy.
Nothing now.	Häzir hiç zat ýok.

You don't have to do that.	Muny etmeli däl.
He can't get it.	Ol muny alyp bilenok.

It will be closest to us.	Bize iň ýakyn bolar.

Why was there no other girl?	Näme üçin başga bir gyz ýokdy?
It was also a full moon.	Şeýle hem, doly Aý boldy.
It just helps.	Diňe kömek edýär.
I do not know.	Men bilemok.
He is not coming.	Ol gelenok.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
Of course, this is not good.	Elbetde, bu gowy däl.

I will be like you	Men seniň ýaly bolaryn.
Not this morning.	Bu gün irden däl.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.

You can actually say bad things.	Aslynda erbet aýdyp bilersiňiz.
"All right," he said.	Ol: "Bolýar" -diýdi.
That's all.	Hemme zat şeýle.
He was anxious to leave.	Ol gitmek üçin biynjalyk boldy.
He makes it very difficult.	Ol muny gaty kyn edýär.

No one knows why.	Näme üçin hiç kim bilenok.
A few big short things.	Birnäçe uly gysga zatlar.
Really great night.	Hakykatdanam ajaýyp gije.
Of course this can happen.	Elbetde bu bolup biler.
I hope this helps!	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin!

They are very strange.	Olar gaty geň.
It will always be that way.	Elmydama şeýle bolar.
He wants it badly.	Ol muny erbet isleýär.
Now or never.	Häzir ýa-da hiç haçan.
She is really smart.	Ol hakykatdanam gaty akylly.
I never saw you like that.	Men seni beýle görmedim.
Hard, but not great.	Gaty, ýöne ajaýyp däl.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
It was crazy to think that.	Muny pikir etmek däli boldy.
I've never seen one before.	Men ozal hiç wagt görmedim.
What a disturbing thought.	Nähili biynjalyk pikir.
It was not so much.	Bu beýle kän däldi.
He was no longer alive.	Ol indi durmuş däldi.
It's easy to do that.	Muny etmek ýeterlik aňsat.
I have a message.	Mende habar bar.
She returned home.	Ol öýe gaýdyp geldi.
You will never be happy with that.	Munuň bilen hiç wagt bagtly bolmaz.
I could not speak.	Men gürläp bilmedim.
Here it is.	Ine, şu.
It can be good for a meal or two.	Nahar ýa-da iki nahar üçin gowy bolup biler.
He didn't want to.	Ol muny islemedi.
You are already here.	Siz eýýäm şu ýerde.

This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
You are me	Sen eýýäm men.
He may be worried about himself tomorrow.	Ertir özi hakda alada edip biler.
He doesn't need any advice on this.	Oňa bu barada hiç hili maslahat gerek däl.
It never comes.	Hiç haçan gelenok.
There is a reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi bar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu boldy, indi bolar.
Bad bad	Erbet erbet.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.

Surprisingly, this is not the case.	Geň zat, bu beýle däl.

Tell him he's crazy to think about.	Oňa pikir etmek üçin däli bolandygyny aýdyň.
In fact, they are worse off.	Aslynda olar has erbet.
It will be something.	Bu bir zat bolar.

Everything is against me.	Hemme zat maňa garşy.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
They agree.	Olar gaty razy.
He wants to take me.	Ol meni almak isleýär.
It was a long night.	Bu uzak gije boldy.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.

He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
Not so young anymore.	Indi beýle ýaş däl.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
It's too young to admit it.	Bu işi boýun almak üçin ýaş.
Too much to take.	Almak gaty köp.
He is crazy.	Ol däli.
That sounds good to me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy zat ýaly.
Now is the time.	Indi ýekeje wagt.

There are two possible answers.	Iki jogap mümkin.
Oh! 	Aý!
This is not difficult.	Bu kyn däl.
This was not the time.	Bu wagt däldi.
There is an opportunity here.	Bu ýerde bir mümkinçilik bar.
There was no problem.	Hiç hili kynçylyk ýokdy.
He was very worried.	Ol gaty köp alada etdi.
And then to think like us.	Soň bolsa biziň ýaly pikir etmek.
I hope it will be this year.	Bu ýyl bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
She knew in that look that he had failed her.	Oňa kömek edip bilmejekdigini gaty gowy bilýärdi.

We don’t have to tell you why this happened.	Munuň näme üçin bolandygyny bize aýtmak hökman däl.
He said it would help.	Munuň kömek etjekdigini aýtdy.
He was there, and then he left.	Ol ýerde bardy, soň gitdi.

Please, he thought about it.	Haýyş edýärin, ol bu barada pikir etdi.
Help me	Maňa kömek et.
No books.	Kitap ýok.
That's all he needs.	Bu oňa zerur zat.
This is the person you need.	Bu size zerur adam.
That was not the case before.	Ozal beýle däldi.
What a bad thing this is.	Bu nähili erbet zat.
He is alone.	Ol ýeke.

That's right.	Dogry.

And so it was.	Ol hem şeýle boldy.
That was it.	Bu hem boldy.
He can go.	Ol gidip biler.
He did well.	Gowy etdi.

It was as if he could only help.	Ol diňe kömek edip bilýän ýalydy.

It could be the same.	Şeýle hem bolup biler.
He knows this now.	Ol muny indi bilýär.
Seriously, it looks beautiful.	Çynlakaý, owadan görünýär.
We have to be.	Biz bolmaly.
I don't know.	Men muny bilemok.
There is no way.	Asla ýol ýok.
We are very good.	Biz gaty gowy.
I thought it was stupid.	Bu samsyk ýalydy öýdüpdim.
You still have hope.	Size entek umyt bar.
This is none of it.	Bu onuň hiç biri däl.
It could be.	Bu bolup biler.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
That makes me crazy.	Bu bolsa meni däli edýär.

It was like a good idea right away.	Derrew gowy pikir ýaly boldy.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
It was too bad to leave.	Gitmek gaty erbet boldy.
That's right.	Şeýle.
You should never be alone.	Hiç haçan ýeke bolmaly däl.
You have to go now.	Indi gitmeli.
He didn't really need it.	Aslynda oňa mätäç däldi.
It came to me very quickly.	Maňa gaty çalt geldi.
Everyone has a different job.	Her kimiň başga işi bar.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
This year was a surprise.	Bu ýyl geň boldy.
Sounds good.	Gowy ýaly.
I could never do it.	Hiç haçan edip bilmedim.
He may need it, but he never thinks about it.	Oňa mätäç bolup biler, ýöne bu hakda hiç wagt pikir etmeýär.
This is a very bad thing.	Bu gaty erbet zat.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
This is more difficult.	Bu has kyn.
Something new happened last night.	Düýn agşam täze bir zat boldy.
Not necessarily.	Hökman däl.
I can't do anything	Men hiç zat edip bilemok
Isn't that right? 	Bu dogry dälmi?
I can help more.	Has köp kömek edip bilerin.
They will never be.	Olar asla bolmaz.
Of course, if it's good.	Elbetde, gowy bolsa.
I just need a break.	Maňa diňe dynç gerek.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
This is very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal.
There are actually two reasons for this.	Aslynda munuň iki sebäbi bar.
Last year was the best decision.	Geçen ýyl iň gowy karar.
No permission is required for this.	Munuň üçin rugsat gerek däl.
I often think of you.	Men siziň hakda köplenç pikir edýärin.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
It will not happen again.	Mundan beýläk bolmaz.
The thought troubled him.	Bu pikir ony biynjalyk etdi.
It was great.	Gaty gowy boldy.
No offers to buy.	Satyn almak üçin teklip ýok.
You can see that too.	Muny hem görüp bilersiňiz.
Good.	Gowy.
I was fine.	Men gowy boldum.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
To himself, only to himself.	Özüne, diňe özüne.
It has to be big money.	Bu uly pul bolmaly.
.	.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
Because these things happen.	Sebäbi bu zatlar bolýar.
Must buy.	Satyn almaly.
It was not enough.	Ol ýeterlik däldi.
It's not about him.	Bu ol hakda däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň alyp biljek zady.
Who is close to you?	Kim size ýakyn?
I need advice.	Maňa maslahat gerek.
Me	Ine
The idea is that he can do it alone.	Bu pikir ýeke-täk edip biler diýen pikir.
I am and I am not.	Men bar we men ýok.
This was not possible.	Bu, mümkin däldi.
Not just a good idea.	Diňe gowy pikir däl.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Saňa hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
He got it.	Ol aldy.
It was not so good.	Bu beýle bir gowy däldi.
Nothing good about it.	Bu hakda hiç zat gowy däl.
It will not be difficult.	Bu kyn bolmaz.
I'll go and call.	Men gidip jaň ederin.
You can do the same.	Muny hem edip bilersiňiz.
He is as good as everyone else.	Ol hemmeler ýaly gowy.
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
Do something for me.	Meniň üçin bir zat et.
You shouldn't think so.	Beýle diýip pikir etmeli däl.
It should be the same.	Şeýle hem bolmaly.
No one agrees.	Hiç kim muňa razy däl.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
This is crazy fast.	Bu çalt däli.
I can't	Men edip bilemok
Giving him some advice, but not talking.	Oňa başga bir maslahat bermek, ýöne gürleşmek däl.
What exactly happened.	Aslynda bu näme boldy.
I'll call you tonight.	Şu gije size jaň ederin.
Not here, not here.	Bu ýerde däl, şu ýerde.
It will always be.	Ol hemişe bolar.
It takes a lot of money.	Uly pul gerek.
This is often the case.	Bu hakykatdanam köplenç bolýar.
It didn't seem to be new.	Ol täze zat däl ýalydy.
I just have to go here.	Men diňe şu ýere gitmeli.
I have to be happy.	Men bagtly bolmaly.
And then he answered me.	Soň bolsa maňa jogap berdi.
None, none, none.	Hiç biri, hiç biri, hiç biri.
Always there.	Elmydama şol ýerde.
You have to agree to help.	Kömek etmäge razy bolmaly.
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däl.
Now he has done it.	Indi ol muny etdi.
He seemed to need it.	Oňa mätäç ýalydy.
More interesting.	Has gyzykly.
Looks like a great day.	Ajaýyp gün ýaly bolup görünýär.
He didn't pay attention.	Muňa üns bermedi.
It will be everywhere.	Bu hemme ýerde bolar.
He says he won't.	Etmejekdigini aýdýar.
If there is a next one.	Indiki bar bolsa.
He knows this now.	Ol muny indi bilýär.
Really good question.	Hakykatdanam gaty gowy sorag.
This month is short.	Bu aý gysga.
He did so a week ago.	Bir hepde mundan ozal şeýle etdi.
It was a long and difficult night.	Uzak we kyn gije boldy.
I only have one suggestion.	Mende diňe bir teklip bar.
Because he didn’t want to be close to her.	Sebäbi ol özüne ýakyn bolmak islemedi.
He did it that morning.	Ol şol gün irden etdi.
There are two ways to do this.	Bu barada iki ýol ýok.
Lucky for them, I have.	Olar üçin bagtly, mende bar.
He knows a lot.	Ol köp zady bilýär.
I called you a lot.	Men saňa köp jaň etdim.
He couldn't even see.	Ol hatda görüp bilmedi.
He knew about both.	Ol ikisi hakda bilýärdi.
Maybe you can help us.	Belki, bize kömek edip bilersiňiz.
No one voted for it.	Hiç kim muňa ses bermedi.
This is what happens every day.	Ine, her gün şeýle bolýar.
A week ago.	Bir hepde öň.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
And then he did it again.	Soň bolsa ýene etdi.
There is not much here.	Bu ýerde kän bir zat ýok.
He didn't care.	Ol alada etmedi.
I couldn't go anywhere, I couldn't do anything.	Men hiç ýere gidip bilmedim, hiç zat edip bilmedim.
It is impossible to do so.	Muny etmek mümkin däl.
I can't tell her.	Men oňa aýdyp bilemok.
I can help him.	Men oňa kömek edip bilerin.
I just ask.	Diňe haýyş edýärin.
I know it still exists.	Onuň henizem bardygyny bilýärin.
I have always been his.	Men hemişe onuň.
He says he knows nothing about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat bilmeýändigini aýdýar.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, hatda teklip hem däl.
This is not a quick time.	Bu çalt wagt däl.
To call	Jaň etmek
It really happened.	Bu hakykatdanam boldy.

Must be ready immediately.	Derrew taýyn bolmaly.

It will be.	Bu bolar.
He didn't want to be anywhere.	Ol hiç ýerde bolmak islemedi.
Full book.	Doly kitap.
Everyone knows.	Hemmeler bilýär.
In fact, he did nothing.	Aslynda hiç zat etmedi.
I don't want to be serious.	Çynlakaý bolmak islämok.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
We can try.	Synap bileris.
I don't believe he can.	Edip biljekdigine ynanamok.
Of course things can happen.	Elbetde zatlar bolup biler.
Good here	Bu ýerde gowy.
Thinking about work and money can be very difficult nowadays.	Iş we pul hakda pikir etmek häzirki wagtda gaty kyn ýaly bolup biler.
I heard that.	Men muny eşitdim.
New sound.	Täze ses.
It has been a long day for him.	Bu onuň üçin uzak gün boldy.
I'm so stupid.	Men şeýle bir samsyk.
He asked.	Sorag berdi.
Time is short.	Wagt gysga.
It may have helped more time.	Has köp wagt kömek eden bolmagy mümkin.
This will not be true.	Bu dogry bolmaz.
We can do it all.	Hemmesini edip bileris.
She was beautiful, not beautiful.	Ol owadan, owadan däldi.
It was very interesting for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gyzykly boldy.
He stayed there.	Ol şol ýerde galdy.
I thought it was too big for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty uly diýip pikir etdim.
Nothing can be said.	Hiç zat aýdyp bolmaz.
It was a lot of fun.	Bu gaty hezil boldy.
And then this is the last question.	Soň bolsa bu soňky sorag.
It takes several hours.	Birnäçe sagat gerek.
It turned out well.	Gowy çykdy.
OK, let's go.	Bolýar, gitmeli.
Now it's just me.	Indi diňe men.
I didn't see that.	Men muny görmedim.

There was a reason for that.	Munuň bir sebäbi bardy.
He was not very young.	Ol gaty ýigit däldi.
I'm afraid to think.	Men pikir etmekden gorkýaryn.
It’s nothing, but everything.	Bu hiç zat däl, ýöne hemme zat.
You don't have to answer right away.	Derrew jogap bermeli däl.
About this song.	Bu aýdym hakda.
They were not before.	Olar öň däldi.

And then he started talking.	Soň bolsa gürläp başlady.
You have to pay attention.	Üns bermeli.

This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
There is something really great about it.	Ol ýerde hakykatdanam uly bir zat bar.
You are at home	Sen öýde.
That was not the case at the time.	Şol wagt beýle däldi.
He could go to school.	Mekdebe gidip bilýärdi.
I was crazy for them.	Men olar üçin däli boldum.
It was great.	Bu ajaýyp boldy.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
Nothing else can be done.	Başga hiç zat edip bolmaz.
This is a bad decision.	Bu erbet karar.
It was impossible for him to be here.	Onuň bu ýerde bolmagy mümkin däldi.
Money is good.	Pul gowy.
Everything can be bought.	Hemme zady satyn alyp bolýar.
I should never do that.	Men hiç haçan etmeli däl.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I want to do that right.	Men muny dogry etmek isleýärin.

That's exactly what happened.	Ine, hakykatdanam näme.
He asked me a question.	Ol menden sorag sorady.
I didn't care.	Men muňa alada etmedim.
This is how it looks.	Ine, bu şeýle görünýär.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman bolmaz.
No one is the way.	Hiç kim ýol däl.
No one can take that from me.	Muny hiç kim menden alyp bilmez.
Last year.	Geçen ýyl.
There was a problem.	Mesele bardy.
I have to help her.	Men oňa kömek etmeli.
I don't care about that.	Men ol hakda alada etmeýärin.
He did it now.	Ol indi etdi.
I hope this helped you.	Bu size kömek etdi diýip umyt edýärin.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.

No one is easy.	Hiç biri aňsat däl.
Oh, very good.	Aý, gaty gowy.
How much to pay	Näçe bermeli
I have never seen a problem before.	Meseläni öňem görmedim.

I hope it helps.	Kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
I want to be so good.	Men şeýle gowy bolmak isleýärin.
This is crazy.	Bu däli.
What would a man be like.	Adam nähili bolardy.
He didn't pay attention to you.	Ol saňa üns bermedi.
This is an offer.	Bu teklip.
It would be great for him.	Oňa gaty gowy bolardy.
What a concern.	Nähili alada.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle edýär.
No other way.	Başga ýol däl.

Good news for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin gowy habar.
Time is running out.	Wagt ýok boldy.
Only.	Diňe.
I didn't want anything.	Men hiç zat islemedim.

It will be today and it will be one day.	Bu gün bolar we bir gün bolar.
He knows he's here, isn't he?	Ol özüniň şu ýerde bolandygyny bilýär, beýle däl.
He came up with really difficult things.	Ol hakykatdanam gaty kyn zatlar bilen geldi.
He can't speak.	Ol gürläp bilmeýär.
I really have to go home.	Men hakykatdanam öýe gitmeli.
I want to help you	Size kömek etmek isleýärin
He will not obey us.	Ol bize boýun bolmaz.
He should not be allowed to.	Oňa ýol bermeli däl.
He had to do something about it.	Ol bu barada bir zat etmeli boldy.
The book is crazy.	Kitap däli.
The sound is also very good.	Ses hem gaty gowy.
Surprisingly, he didn’t do it anymore.	Geň zat, ol mundan beýläk etmedi.
He is the only one.	Ol ýeke-täk.
This was not the only thing.	Bu diňe bir zat däldi.
That's right.	Gaty dogry.
Then he came to her.	Soň bolsa oňa geldi.

I'm sorry, please.	Bagyşlaň, haýyş.
That was the decision he made.	Bu oňa karar berdi.
It was really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn boldy.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
This is great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy.
I thought it would be earlier today.	Bu gün öňem bolar diýip pikir etdim.
It was like a few hours for me.	Meniň üçin birnäçe sagat ýalydy.
Because it's too early.	Sebäbi entek ir.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Bolýar gürleşmek üçin wagt.
That was not a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir däldi.
In fact, it is not.	Aslynda ýok, bu dogry däl.
There was something strange about him.	Ol hakda geň bir zat bardy.
Nor is it.	Şeýle hem beýle däl.
Of course, it was hard to get it.	Elbetde, muny almak kyn boldy.
I didn't care.	Alada etmedim.
There is only one answer for one thing.	Bir zat üçin diňe bir jogap ýok.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, beýle etmedi.
I really believe in him.	Men oňa hakykatdanam ynanýaryn.
Here you have to lend it to him.	Bu ýerde oňa karz bermeli.
I am happy for him.	Men onuň üçin bagtly.
I think he is.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol kimdir.
He didn't need to ask me.	Oňa menden haýyş gerek däldi.
Oh! 	Aý!
Of course, this is not the only issue.	Elbetde, bu ýeke-täk däl.
Because there really is only one.	Sebäbi hakykatdanam diňe bir bar.
No debt, no money.	Karz ýok, pul ýok.
There are three cops.	Üç polisiýa bar.
He did the impossible.	Mümkin däl zady etdi.
He could no longer see her.	Ol indi ony görüp bilmedi.
There is so much to do.	Edip biljek zatlary kän.
There are good things.	Gowy zatlar bar.
Now everything is different.	Häzir hemme zat başga.
I heard it once.	Men ony bir gezek eşitdim.

She is so beautiful.	Ol şeýle bir owadan.
We can both.	Ikimizem bolup bileris.
Really interesting stuff.	Hakykatdanam gaty gyzykly zatlar.

They are not.	Olar beýle däl.
This is a wonderful thing.	Bu ajaýyp bir zat.
She is wonderful to me.	Ol meniň üçin ajaýyp.
I did not know	Bilmedim.
He knows more tomorrow.	Ertir has köp zady biler.
I hope the next one will be easier.	Indiki biri has aňsat bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
It would be nice to know that.	Muny bilmek gowy bolardy.

I just heard about them.	Men olar hakda diňe eşitdim.
It won't be too bad.	Gaty erbet bolmaz.

That's the way life is.	Durmuş şeýle.

This is strange.	Bu geň.
She is beautiful, intelligent and very interesting.	Ol owadan, akylly we gaty gyzykly.
This makes me very anxious.	Bu meni gaty biynjalyk edýär.

And then he left.	Soň bolsa ol gitdi.

That would be too much.	Bu gaty köp bolardy.
It will be interesting.	Gyzykly bolar.
It may or may not be very happy for you.	Bu siziň üçin gaty bagtly bolup biler ýa-da bolmaz.
He didn't care.	Alada etmedi.
This is the first challenge.	Bu ilkinji kynçylyk.
I wonder who can talk to her like that.	Kimiň özi bilen beýle gürläp biljekdigine haýran.
Of course, this is not enough.	Elbetde, bu ýeterlik däl.
Why is that?	Näme üçin beýle?
Can do a little better.	Biraz gowy edip biler.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
This time he was not alone.	Bu gezek ol ýeke däldi.
There are many things you can do.	Siz köp zatlar edip bilersiňiz.
I hope he comes back here.	Bu ýere gaýdyp geler diýip umyt edýärin.
It seems easy to me.	Maňa aňsat görünýär.
This is advice.	Bu maslahat.
This is nothing new.	Bu täze zat däl.
In fact advice.	Aslynda maslahat.
He wanted to know everything.	Ol hemme zady bilmek isledi.
Whoever it is	Kim bolsa

Not good.	Gowy däl.

This is not just a good thing.	Bu diňe gowy zat däl.
It's also easy to see.	Muny görmek hem aňsat.
This is for me.	Bu meniň üçin.
Of course, today will be a weekend.	Elbetde, bu gün dynç güni bolar.
Good man	Gowy adam.
He thought you knew something.	Ol bir zat bilýärsiň diýip pikir etdi.
It's always good to see him.	Ony görmek elmydama gowy zat.
It really helped a few people.	Birnäçe adam üçin bu hakykatdanam kömek etdi.
Great to see.	Görmek gaty gowy.
Not many people.	Bu adam kän däl.
It was different today.	Bu gün başga boldy.
This is too much for us.	Bu biziň üçin gaty köp.
I'm sure it will.	Boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
This is really the only thing that matters.	Bu hakykatdanam ýeke-täk zat.
I don't know what happened to him.	Oňa näme bolandygyny bilemok.
No need.	Gerek bolmaz.
This will not happen.	Bu bolmaz.
Here are a few suggestions.	Ine birnäçe teklip.
He could not do that.	Muny edip bilmedi.
He has something to do.	Onuň etmeli bir zady bar.
I just can't say enough about it.	Diňe ol hakda ýeterlik zat aýdyp bilemok.
I heard it all.	Men hemmesini eşitdim.
The damage is very good.	Zyýan gaty gowy.
You don't have to do much.	Has köp zat etmeli däl.
He took it.	Ol alyp gitdi.
There is another interesting issue.	Başga bir gyzykly mesele bar.
Surprisingly, even.	Geň zat, hatda.
A man like me.	Meniň ýaly adam.
You have good news.	Size gowy habar bar.
I thought there was a big chance.	Uly mümkinçilik bar diýip pikir etdim.
I don't need someone like you.	Maňa seniň ýaly adam gerek däl.
That was a lie.	Bu ýalan boldy.
No one suggested it to me.	Hiç kim muny maňa teklip etmedi.
He was surprised.	Oňa geň galdy.
Not available for two weeks.	Iki hepde bäri ýok.
This time it got worse.	Bu gezek has erbet boldy.
Please.	Haýyş edýärin.
It will be good tomorrow.	Ertir gowy bolar.

You just don't have to.	Diňe size gerek däl.
He asked you.	Ol senden sorady.
To get	Almak üçin
It works well.	Gowy iş edýär.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ol ýerde bir mesele.
That would be really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly bolardy.
Very strange.	Gaty geň.
He did so beautifully.	Şeýle bir owadan etdi.
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
He knows this now.	Ol muny indi bilýär.
The police did not tell us much.	Polisiýa bize kän zat aýtmady.
Can you help me?	Maňa kömek edip bilersiňizmi?
Of course we can.	Elbetde edip bileris.
No one really responded.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam jogap bermedi.
She is really smart.	Ol hakykatdanam akylly.
returns	gaýdyp gelýär.
I was very close.	Men gaty ýakyn boldum.
There is not much opportunity here.	Bu ýerde kän mümkinçilik ýok.
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
I didn't think so.	Men muny pikir etmedim.
There is nothing crazy about it.	Ol ýerde däli zat ýok.
With someone as beautiful as you.	Seniň ýaly owadan biri bilen.
He knew he had done that.	Ol munuň ýaly zady edendigini bilýärdi.
Okay, that's weird.	Bolýar, bu geň zat.
That would be enough.	Bu ýeterlik bolar.
Of course, something worries you.	Elbetde, bir zat sizi biynjalyk edýär.
It wasn't really that bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet däldi.
Now there is only one left.	Indi diňe biri galdy.
This, of course, was not the case.	Bu, asla ýokdy.
Not really good at all.	Aslynda gaty gowy däl.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
It was not necessary.	Bu hökman däldi.
I hope this sounds interesting.	Bu gyzykly ýaly bolar diýip umyt edýärin.
I really hate it.	Men hakykatdanam ýüz.
Only left.	Diňe galdy.
In fact, it is a good thing.	Aslynda bu gowy zat.
Of course I will be with you.	Elbetde, men siziň bilen bolaryn.

Not the first time, not the last.	Ilkinji gezek däl, iň soňky däl.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe has köp üns bermeli.
There were three reasons for this.	Munuň üç sebäbi bardy.
Okay, now for them.	Bolýar, indi olar üçin.
What is this 	Bu näme?
I had to ask a question.	Men bir sorag bermeli boldum.
I was very worried tonight.	Bu gije gaty alada etdim.
That's what happens.	Ine, şeýle bolýar.
I must be like you.	Men hökman seniň ýaly.
Good job	Gowy iş.
Nothing else will happen.	Başga hiç zat bolmaz.
The two men were not good.	Iki adam gowy däldi.
In fact, he could not speak.	Aslynda gürläp bilmedi.
Not only that.	Diňe beýle däl.
Maybe we can help.	Belki kömek edip bileris.
I just don't know when.	Diňe haçan bilemok.
This suggestion is good for you.	Bu teklip siziň üçin gowy.
There is no other option.	Başga mümkinçilik ýok.
Last month he promised again.	Geçen aý ýene söz berdi.
It's fast.	Çalt bar.
Next time.	Indiki gezek.
That's it.	Bu zat.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
It wasn't long.	Uzak däldi.
Two mistakes.	Iki ýalňyşlyk.
He asked for it twice.	Iki gezek muny isledi.
I didn't think he would care.	Oňa alada eder öýdemokdym.
I had never seen anything like it before.	Men ozal beýle zady görmedim.
He is here too.	Ol hem şu ýerde.
Can someone help?	Kimdir biri kömek edip biler?
There, somewhere.	Ol ýerde, bir ýerde.
Can be an adult.	Uly adam bolup biler.
Nothing is right.	Hiç zat dogry däl.
I thought about it.	Men bu barada pikir etdim.
That's not enough	Siz muňa ýeterlik däl
I can't help it.	Men muňa kömek edip bilemok.
It's gone.	Bu hem gitdi.
Of course, this is not just a proposal.	Elbetde, bu diňe bir teklip däl.
It may not be the right time.	Dogry wagt däl bolmagy mümkin.
He agreed to do so.	Ol muny etmäge razy boldy.
You have to do this for me.	Muny meniň üçin etmeli.
Where can he be.	Ol nirede bolup biler.
Nothing else can happen.	Başga zatlar bolup bilmez.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ol indi alyp bilmedi.
He couldn't even see me.	Ol hatda meni görüp bilmedi.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
It's not that hard to see.	Ony görmek beýle kyn däl.
I really, really want to.	Hakykatdanam, hakykatdanam isleýärin.
No one could help.	Hiç kim kömek edip bilmedi.
There was something wrong with that.	Bu barada bir erbet zat bardy.
Really, everything.	Hakykatdanam, hemme zat.
He was good to me.	Ol maňa gowy boldy.
Now he wants an answer.	Häzir jogap isleýär.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
Really with you	Hakykatdanam seniň bilen
Of course, they are different.	Elbetde, olar başga zat.
They are nothing.	Olar zat däl.
He didn't say much.	Ol kän zat aýtmady.
Two years, maybe three years.	Iki ýyl, belki üç ýyl.
One, then two, then three.	Bir, soň iki, soň üç.
He cares about you.	Ol sen hakda alada edýär.
This is a great offer.	Bu gaty gowy teklip.
What was he trying to do with himself?	Özi bilen näme etjek boldy.
This is no longer true.	Bu indi dogry däl ýaly.
It's always hard.	Elmydama kyn.
Of course there was no moon.	Elbetde aý ýokdy.
Of course I will !.	Elbetde bolaryn!.
Very hard to know.	Bilýän gaty kyn.
We can do it together!	Bilelikde bilelikde edip bileris!.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
There was no way to find out.	Muny bilmek üçin hiç hili ýol ýokdy.
Necessary, but not enough.	Zerur, ýöne ýeterlik däl.
Probably.	Mümkin.
Because he wanted to.	Sebäbi ol isledi.
It can be long.	Uzak hem bolup biler.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He did not tell her.	Ol oňa aýtmady.
It's hard to say.	Bu zatlar hakda aýtmak kyn.
The food is somewhere.	Nahar bir ýerde.
There seems to be no problem.	Mesele ýok ýaly.
I couldn't tell him more.	Men oňa has köp zat aýdyp bilmedim.
I'm not that person anymore.	Men indi ol adam däl.
He did not know why.	Näme üçin, bilmedi.
The sun has risen.	Gün çykdy.
It helped me a lot.	Maňa gaty köp kömek etdi.
He makes me crazy.	Ol meni däli edýär.
Last but not least.	Iň soňky.
No decision.	Karar ýok.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
I had to do it now.	Men indi etmeli boldum.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
Maybe help will come.	Belki kömek geler.
I've never done that before.	Men ozal beýle zady etmedim.
Two other people have already arrived today.	Bu gün eýýäm başga iki adam geldi.
It takes time.	Munuň üçin wagt gerek.
What should he do? 	Ol näme etmeli?
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
He lives mostly now.	Ol häzirki wagtda köplenç ýaşaýar.
Just what happens.	Diňe näme bolýar.
It would be.	Bu bolardy.
It was a fun day for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin gyzykly gün boldy.
He couldn't sleep much last night.	Düýn agşam kän uklap bilmedi.
He said he did not know.	Bilmeýändigini aýtdy.
Everything would be fine.	Hemme zat gowy bolardy.
A tip.	Bir maslahat.
That's fine with me.	Bu meniň bilen gowy.
I was his.	Men onuň boldum.
He didn't just care about them.	Ol diňe olar hakda alada etmedi.
I think there is something there.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ýerde bir zat bar.
Tomorrow.	Ertir.
I never do that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmeýärin.
He wants everything for himself.	Ol özi üçin hemme zady isleýär.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu bir zat, maňa gaýdyp geldi.
That's right, of course.	Dogry, elbetde.
I think we can say that. "	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle aýdyp bileris "-diýdi.
There was no way out.	Munuň üçin hiç hili ýol ýokdy.
Anyone can say whatever they want.	Her kim islän zadyny aýdyp biler.
It's really hard to say.	Muny aýtmak hakykatdanam kyn.
It would be a few weeks.	Birnäçe hepde bolardy.
I have and.	Özüm bar we.
They have to go.	Olar gitmeli.
It always causes.	Elmydama sebäp bolýar.
The two are very close.	Ikisi gaty ýakyn.

And the best person for the job.	We iş üçin iň gowy adam.
I would like to visit you.	Men size baryp görmek isleýärin.
It was fast.	Bu çalt boldy.
I want to talk about it.	Men bu hakda gürleşmek isleýärin.
Easy money for someone.	Kimdir biri üçin aňsat pul.
I had no such problem.	Mende beýle mesele ýokdy.
It turned out to be more.	Has köp zat bolup çykdy.
Not just that.	Diňe bolmaz.
Because he didn't want to talk.	Sebäbi ol gürleşmek islemedi.
I can't get it right now.	Men häzir muny alyp bilemok.
Now we can worry.	Indi alada edip bileris.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
No one could be with him.	Hiç kim onuň bilen bile bolup bilmedi.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
He called a few hours ago.	Birnäçe sagat ozal jaň etdi.
You already have it	Sen eýýäm bar
Quick and short.	Çalt we gysga.
He took her there.	Ony şol ýerde alyp bardy.
He wanted to know more about her.	Ol hakda has köp bilmek isledi.

This is an interesting thing.	Bu gyzykly bir zat.
Surprised.	Muňa geň galdy.

Okay.	Bolýar.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
I always think about things.	Men elmydama zatlar hakda pikir edýärin.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle bolup bilmez.
This is not the right answer.	Bu dogry jogap däl.
It was one this morning.	Bu gün irden bir boldy.
It's beautiful, it's beautiful.	Bu owadan, ajaýyp.
I really have to go.	Men hakykatdanam gitmeli.
It seems to be everywhere now.	Häzirki wagtda hemme ýerde bar ýaly.
What he knew could not help him.	Bilýän zatlary oňa kömek edip bilmedi.
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýok.
He was almost human.	Ol adam diýen ýalydy.
That should be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolmaly.
It helps a lot.	Bu gaty uly kömek edýär.
There was no one at home at the time.	Şol wagt öýde hiç kim ýokdy.
Not good, not bad.	Gowy däl, erbet däl.
Just so young.	Diňe şeýle ýaş.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu siziň üçin dogry zat.
She had to help me.	Ol maňa kömek etmeli boldy.
What will happen.	Näme bolar.
He is no more.	Ol häzir ýok.

You can do well.	Gowy edip bilersiňiz.
We always have everything, always.	Biz her zat elmydama, hemişe.

The money is here.	Pul şu ýerde.
If necessary.	Zerur bolsa.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
This is not a good thing for us.	Bu biziň üçin gowy zat däl.
And then he did it again.	Soň bolsa ýene etdi.
Interesting fun for me.	Meniň üçin gyzykly gyzykly.
And you are stupid.	Sen bolsa samsyk.
There is a very good reason for this.	Munuň gaty gowy sebäbi bar.
Just three months ago.	Diňe üç aý öň.
Only the two of us.	Diňe ikimiz.
He protested as if he wanted her.	Ol ony isleýän ýalydy, garşy çykdy.
Here is the problem.	Ine, mesele.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
He did not want to rest.	Ol dynç almak islemedi.
I couldn't figure out why someone could be.	Näme üçin kimdir biri bolup biler diýip pikir edip bilmedim.
I called a few times.	Birnäçe jaň etdim.
I never saw him.	Men ony asla görmedim.
How is that with him?	Bu onuň bilen nähili.
There may be a problem.	Mesele bolup biler.
He did not want to be alone again.	Ol ýene ýeke bolmak islemedi.
Making the right decision.	Dogry karar bermek.
This is a big question.	Bu uly sorag.
It would be better now.	Häzirki wagtda has gowy bolardy.
It happened every day, every time.	Bu her gün, her gezek boldy.
I'm not always	Men hemişe däl.

You don't really need to.	Aslynda size gerek däl.
I'm not this guy	Men bu ýigit däl
This was not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däldi.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe hiç zat etmeli däl.
He really wants to do things right.	Ol hakykatdanam zatlary dogry etmek isleýär.
It was fun there.	Ol ýerde hezil boldy.
So it can be done right.	Şonuň üçin ony dogry edip bolýar.
He did everything right.	Ol hemme zady dogry etdi.
It already exists.	Ol eýýäm bar.
Who is not good?	Kim gowy däl?
Nothing now.	Häzir hiç zat ýok.
You have to help.	Kömek etmeli.
Not many people can afford it.	Köp adam muny alyp bilenok.
I thought he already knew.	Ol eýýäm bilýär öýdüpdim.
I am an interesting person.	Men gyzykly adam.
It may be, but not always.	Bu bolup biler, ýöne hemişe däl.
I didn't do that.	Men muny etmedim.
This month is not so good.	Bu aý beýle gowy däl.
It always looks good on me.	Elmydama maňa gowy görünýär.
He had to go.	Ol gitmeli boldy.
And now he is for us.	Ine, indi ol biziň üçin.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu zadyň özi.
Nothing will happen.	Hiç zat bolmaz.

He called again.	Ol ýene jaň etdi.
Do it now.	Şu wagt et.
Not just that.	Diňe bolmaz.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I always know that, everyone knows that.	Men muny hemişe bilýärin, hemmeler bilýär.
There was nothing he could do about it.	Onuň üçin edip biljek zady ýokdy.
How did it come to be today?	Bu gün nädip geldi.
This is difficult.	Bu kyn.
He doesn't even want to.	Ol hatda islemeýär.
I don't know when this will happen.	Munuň haçan boljakdygyny bilemok.
He thought it might be interesting.	Gyzykly bolup biler diýip pikir etdi.
Then things got a little weird.	Soň zatlar birneme geň bolup başlady.
I have to go very badly.	Men gaty erbet gitmeli.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
He is there all day.	Ol bütin gün şol ýerde.
Of course, he called that week.	Elbetde, şol hepde jaň etdi.
A lot of money.	Köp pul.
It didn't seem right.	Bu dogry däl ýalydy.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
It was not his day.	Bu onuň güni däldi.
It just looks good.	Diňe gowy ýaly bolup görünýär.
That's strange.	Ine geň zat.
Too bad.	Köp erbet.
There are several suggestions.	Birnäçe teklip bermek mümkin.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
It's two o'clock in the morning.	Irden sagat iki.
We are everywhere.	Biz hemme ýerde.
He went to school a lot.	Mekdebe köp gitdi.
Of course, it is everywhere.	Elbetde, hemme ýerde bar.
She was worried.	Ol alada galdy.
No one wants to make a decision.	Hiç kim karar bermek islemeýär.
It can't be like a problem.	Mesele ýaly bolup bilmez.
Someone else came to bother me.	Başga biri meni biynjalyk etmek üçin geldi.
I'll call him.	Men oňa jaň ederin.
I didn't know what.	Men näme bilmedim.
He is a man.	Ol adam.
That was right.	Bu dogry boldy.
No, not yet.	Ýok, entek däl.
This work was good.	Bu iş gowy boldy.
I think it was great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy boldy.
Do it today.	Şu gün et.
You can give.	Siz berip bilersiňiz.
That's all you have to do.	Bu seniň etmeli zadyň.
This is serious.	Bu çynlakaý.
He can't hurt me.	Ol maňa zyýan berip bilmez.
This seems very interesting to me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gyzykly ýaly.
It shouldn't go away.	Bu gitmeli däl.
This time he agreed.	Bu gezek ol razy boldy.
He didn't have to do that.	Ol muny etmeli däldi.
What happened.	Näme boldy.
You can answer.	Jogap berip bilersiňiz.
Everything was fine for me.	Hemme zat meniň üçin gowy boldy.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
For him.	Onuň üçin .
It's almost nothing.	Bu hiç zat diýen ýaly däl.
That's it.	Ine, şol ýerde.
He needs his job.	Oňa öz işi gerek.
Often you need more.	Köplenç size has köp zat gerek.
Seems like a lot of work.	Köp iş ýaly bolup görünýär.
This is a very difficult question.	Bu gaty kyn sorag.
He did not want to say that.	Ol muny aýtmak islemedi.
Of course, this is not the case at all.	Elbetde, bu düýbünden däl.
I do everything.	Men hemme zady edýärin.
It's easy, but it's hard to do well.	Aňsat, ýöne gowy etmek kyn.
You have to tell him that.	Oňa muny aýtmaly.
It also seems to be very accurate.	Şeýle hem gaty dogry ýaly bolup görünýär.
I can try this.	Muny synap bilerin.
It must be easy to see.	Muny görmek aňsat bolmaly.
It took a long time.	Bu köp wagt aldy.
I thought it would be interesting.	Gyzykly bolar öýdüpdim.
Everything now.	Häzir hemme zat.
I know he doesn't care about me.	Onuň meniň hakda alada etmeýändigini bilýärin.
And then he said he probably knew.	Soň bolsa, belki bilýändigini aýtdy.
Enough to do.	Etmeli zatlar ýeterlik.
Maybe.	Belki bolup biler.
There are several.	Birnäçe bar.
Only so.	Diňe şeýle.
It can be seen.	Muny görmek bolýar.
There is another reason.	Başga bir sebäp bar.
It won't be big.	Bu uly bolmaz.
It's been a long time coming for me.	Meniň üçin bu gaty köp wagt boldy.
This is not a big deal.	Bu beýle uly mesele däl.
The bad news is completely different.	Erbet habar düýbünden başga zat.
Okay, not yet.	Bolýar, entek ýok.
Not you	Sen däl.
The problem was that no one wanted to buy me.	Mesele hiç kim meni satyn almak islemedi.
I have to help her.	Men oňa kömek etmeli.
I don't do that.	Men muny etmeýärin.
And then he did.	Soň bolsa etdi.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat hem bar.
There were other things.	Başga zatlar hem boldy.
Not that month.	Şol aý däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ol etmeli bir zat.
Now we can do more.	Indi has köp zat edip bileris.
If possible every night.	Mümkin bolsa her gije.
I do not agree.	Men razy däl.
He wondered how long it would take.	Näçe wagt galdy diýip pikir etdi.
More is possible now.	Häzirki wagtda has köp zat mümkin.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
Oh, he will.	Aý, eder.
This is a big mistake and a big deal.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk we uly mesele.
I'm thinking of you.	Men sen hakda pikir edýärin.
He never voted.	Ol hiç haçan ses bermedi.
He told me to call.	Ol maňa jaň et diýdi.
The reason is you.	Munuň sebäbi sen.
This is not always easy.	Bu hemişe aňsat däl.
Me? 	Men?
He is not like you.	Ol seniň ýaly däl.
I have something	Mende bir zat bar
I know there is nothing there.	Men ol ýerde hiç zadyň ýokdugyny bilýärin.
He wants to talk to her.	Onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýär.
So stop it.	Şonuň üçin bes et.
You have to pay attention.	Üns bermeli.
You can help me here.	Bu ýerde maňa kömek edip bilersiňiz.
There are still a few weeks left.	Entek birnäçe hepde bar.
You don't have to think about it at all.	Muny asla pikir etmek hökman däl.
You don't have to answer.	Jogap bermek hökman däl.
That's not enough yet.	Bu entek ýeterlik däl.
I'm there.	Men şol ýerde.
There is a problem.	Mesele bar.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Of course, one day he told me to do something.	Elbetde, bir gün maňa bir zat et diýdi.
This was not a problem at all.	Bu asla kynçylyk däldi.
Too much work and not enough time.	Gaty köp iş we wagt ýeterlik däl.
And then kind of.	Soň bolsa bir hili.
I am not.	Men beýle däl.
Great for him.	Onuň üçin ajaýyp.
He thought there was someone who could help me.	Maňa kömek edip biljek biri bar diýip pikir etdi.
You have to give both to get.	Almak üçin ikisi hem bermeli.
I think that was necessary.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu zerur boldy.
This is the only way.	Bu ýeke-täk ýol.
That's a lot of work, too.	Bu hem gaty köp iş.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
I told him one last time.	Men oňa soňky gezek aýtdym.
This is difficult, but not impossible.	Bu kyn, ýöne mümkin däl.
That's all.	Diňe şu.
I can really recommend it here.	Bu ýerde hakykatdanam maslahat berip bilerin.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
It's great to relax.	Dynç almak gaty gowy.
I thought so.	Men şeýle eder öýdüpdim.
It looks better.	Bu has gowy görünýär.
No more words.	Başga söz ýok.
I am smart.	Men akylly.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
He can do it too.	Ol hem edip biler.
This is difficult.	Bu kyn.
It used to be that way.	Şeýle öňem bardy.
No harm done.	Zyýan ýok.
You are this	Sen şu
He looked like a really good guy.	Ol hakykatdanam ajaýyp ýigit ýalydy.
In fact, I once asked about it.	Aslynda bu hakda bir gezek sorag etdim.
There were other things to do.	Başga etmeli zatlar bardy.
I hope not too long.	Gaty uzak däl diýip umyt edýärin.
I obeyed him.	Men oňa boýun boldum.
That's great.	Gaty gowy zat.
That's what happened to me.	Meniň üçin bu boldy.
He asked for help.	Ol kömek sorady.
He didn't think so.	Ol beýle diýip pikir etmedi.
Almost now.	Häzir diýen ýaly.
The only reason for this is.	Munuň ýeke-täk sebäbi.
What's up?	Näme teklip bar?
It would be crazy.	Bu däli bolar.
Of course not.	Elbetde, bu ýerde beýle däl.
I need something for	Maňa bir zat gerek
I'm a little skeptical right now.	Men häzir birneme şübhelenýärin.
Same word	Şol bir söz.
This is not a question.	Bu sorag däl.
I really have.	Mende hakykatdanam bar.
.	.
I thought so.	Men beýle pikir etdim.
They are so beautiful.	Olar gaty owadan.
This is a big lie.	Bu uly ýalan.
We even.	Biz hatda.
I don't know how that happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilemok.
Very good	Köp gowy.
He just does it.	Ol diňe şeýle edýär.
He likes it the same way.	Edil şonuň ýaly halaýar.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Munuň sebäbi bar bolsa gerek.
I didn't do that.	Men beýle etmedim.
More, more.	Köp, has köp.
Man, you have a great time.	Adam, sen gaty uly wagt.
Nothing else.	Başga zat ýok.
Great, but so be it.	Ajaýyp, ýöne şeýle.
This is a day.	Bu bir gün.
I'm just thinking about what will make me happy.	Meni diňe bagtly etjek zat hakda pikir edýärin.
He didn’t really want to think about it.	Aslynda bu hakda pikir etmek islemedi.
It will be.	Bu bolar.
Short time	Gysga wagt.
It's been a while.	Biraz wagt bäri gelýär.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe onuň bilen gitmeli.
Maybe there is something you can do.	Belki, edip biljek bir zady bar.
He is there.	Ol şol ýerde.
Never the other way around.	Hiç haçan başga ýol bilen däl.
He will help us.	Ol bize kömek eder.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolar.
To see him now.	Ony indi görmek üçin.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
You are stupid and stupid.	Sen samsyk we samsyk.
He said he had.	Ol bardygyny aýtdy.
Now he understands.	Indi düşündi.
How fast, how easy it came.	Nähili çalt, nähili aňsat geldi.
He knew he wasn't there.	Ol ýokdugyny bilýärdi.
That would be great for you.	Bu siziň üçin ajaýyp bolardy.
I don't care so much.	Men beýle alada etmeýärin.
Of course, it bothered him.	Elbetde, ony biynjalyk etdi.
Three times.	Üç gezek.
It's about something else.	Bu başga bir zat hakda.
It doesn't have to be that difficult.	Bu beýle kyn bolmaly däl ýaly.
I want it right.	Dogry isleýärin.
He knew the truth about her.	Ol hakda hakykaty bilýärdi.
There really is no other way.	Hakykatdanam başga ýol ýok.
It's a must have, for any Affiliate, promoting any program.	Etmeli, sebäbi ajaýyp.
That can't be good for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy bolup bilmez.
He only knows so much.	Ol diňe gaty köp zady bilýär.
This is not the case.	Bu däl .
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
So it doesn’t have to be that way.	Şonuň üçin beýle bolmaly däl.
It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
I've had a lot.	Men köp boldum.
You can only see it.	Ony diňe görüp bilersiňiz.
One.	Biri.
That word was there again.	Bu söz ýene bardy.
Probably not.	Muňa garşy däl bolsa gerek.
He does it.	Ol muny edýär.
He never had the time he needed.	Ol özüne mätäç wagty hiç wagt ýokdy.
You are just a human being.	Sen diňe adam.
He got it enough.	Ony ýeterlik aldy.
He wanted to help her.	Oňa kömek etmek isledi.
Maybe next year.	Belki indiki ýyl.
For a long time he was still there.	Uzak wagt bäri ol henizem bardy.
I didn't mean to offend him.	Men oňa muny aýtmak islemedim.
I can give or take.	Men berip bilerin ýa-da alyp bilerin.
No help at all.	Asla kömek ýok.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle zat däl.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He wants it.	Ol muny isleýär.
It's not that big.	Bu beýle uly däl.
It really does exist.	Hakykatdanam bar.
Maybe one more time.	Belki, ýene bir gezek.
This is an idea.	Bu bir pikir.
I know it all.	Men hemmesini bilýärin.
He is really a guy.	Ol hakykatdanam ýigit.
Tell her where and when.	Oňa nirede we haçan bolandygyny aýdyň.
You have to be	Sen bolmaly
You know what it was like.	Onuň nähili bolandygyny bilýärsiň.
He does what he wants to do.	Etjek bolýan zadyny edýär.
One day you can be good and bad.	Bir gün gowy hem erbet bolup bilersiňiz.
He couldn't think of them.	Ol olar hakda pikir edip bilmedi.
I never agreed.	Men hiç haçan razy bolmaly däldim.
You have to be a good guy.	Gowy ýigit bolmaly.
So there is hope.	Şonuň üçin umyt bar.
Really fast.	Hakykatdanam çalt.
Why?	Näme üçin?
And then he said.	Soň bolsa aýtdy.
Anyone else can think of anything they want.	Başga her kim islän zadyny pikir edip biler.
I want to be one.	Bir bolmak isleýärin.
Going somewhere.	Ol ýere bir ýere gitmek.
Everyone knew, and no one did anything.	Hemmeler bilýärdi we hiç kim hiç zat etmedi.
The first time is always the worst.	Ilkinji gezek elmydama iň erbet.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He is really stupid.	Ol hakykatdanam samsyk.
No one paid attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa üns bermedi.
I was very difficult.	Men gaty kyn boldum.
It could be.	Bu bolup biler.
There is really no time.	Hakykatdanam wagt ýok.
He can do whatever he wants.	Islän zadyny edip biler.
He should be here right now.	Ol şu wagt şu ýerde bolmaly.
You are just like him.	Sen edil onuň ýaly.
He can't even speak.	Ol hatda gürläp bilmeýär.
This is really nothing.	Bu hakykatdanam hiç zat däl.
He will come.	Geler.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
Then, of course, he did.	Soň, elbetde etdi.
Doing the same is the right thing to do.	Dogry etmek şol bir zat.
He should do the same.	Ol hem etmeli.
What are you going to do now?	Häzir näme etjek bolýar.
So there must be someone else.	Şonuň üçin başga biri bolmaly.
I was three for three.	Üç üçin üç boldum.
Everyone should go home now.	Her kim indi öýe gitmeli.
This can be very long.	Bu gaty uzak wagt bolup biler.
Then he came to her.	Soň bolsa oňa geldi.
We are really, really close.	Biz hakykatdanam, hakykatdanam ýakyn.
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
He could no longer do so.	Ol indi beýle edip bilmedi.
No questions asked.	Sorag ýok.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bir zat henizem ýok.
It should be good.	Gowy bolmaly.
I can tell you right now.	Men saňa şu wagt aýdyp bilerin.
That can only be a good thing.	Bu diňe gowy zat bolup biler.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
Always there	Elmydama bar.
I gave myself to him.	Men özümi oňa berdim.
They are really good.	Olar hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
The time has come.	Wagt gaýdyp geldi.
This has always been the case.	Hemişe şeýle boldy.
Never necessary.	Hiç haçan zerur däl.
It will take a few days.	Birnäçe gün gerek bolar.
It could actually be here.	Aslynda bu ýerde bolup biler.
He thought it would be better for that.	Ol munuň üçin has gowy bolardy diýip pikir etdi.
He wants to tell us something.	Bize bir zat aýtmak isleýär.
Just like a full-time job.	Diňe doly iş güni ýaly.
If not this year, next year.	Bu ýyl däl bolsa, indiki ýyl.
Impossible to see.	Görmek mümkin däl.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
Maybe that helped.	Belki bu kömek eden bolsa gerek.
Because it will be good.	Sebäbi gowy bolar.
I'm not like that there.	Men ol ýerde edil beýle däl.
Night or night.	Gije ýa-da gije.
It's very difficult to talk to him.	Onuň bilen gürleşmek gaty kyn.
I'm sorry about that.	Men oňa gynanýaryn.
So good.	Şonuň üçin gowy.
He didn't want to think about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat hakda pikir etmek islemedi.
I want to do everything with you.	Men seniň bilen hemme zady etmek isleýärin.
I did it after that.	Mundan soň etdim.
I am stupid	Meni samsyk
I saw you	Men seni gördüm
OK, you can do it now.	Bolýar, indi edip bilersiňiz.
He went everywhere with me.	Meniň bilen hemme ýere gitdi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
There are two issues.	Iki mesele bar.
What else can you really say?	Hakykatdanam başga näme aýdyp bilersiňiz?
He stayed to talk.	Ol gürleşmek üçin galdy.
He can no longer go.	Ol mundan beýläk baryp bilmez.
You can't just go	Diňe gidip bolmaz
I don't know if anyone will do that.	Hiç kimiň beýle etjekdigini bilemok.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
You have to get someone else.	Başga birini almaly.
Of course it happened.	Elbetde boldy.
There is actually one or two other things.	Aslynda başga bir ýa-da iki zat bar.
There was no bad word anywhere.	Hiç ýerde erbet söz ýokdy.
He told me that.	Ol maňa muny aýtdy.
What should we do?	Biz näme etmeli?
This is a wonderful word.	Bu ajaýyp söz.
I am the last	Men iň soňky
This is just life.	Bu diňe durmuş.
This was not the worst.	Bu iň erbet däldi.
A lot has happened.	Köp zat boldy.
It helps us.	Bu bize kömek edýär.
I never saw it.	Men muny hiç haçan görmedim.
I can do anything for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin hemme zady edip bilerin.
He's just a guy.	Ol diňe ýigit.
It seems.	Bu görünýär.
There may be more.	Has köp bolup biler.
I can't say that.	Men muny aýdyp bilemok.
This may be true for you too.	Bu siziň üçin hem dogry bolup biler.
I saw it yesterday.	Düýn ony gördüm.
Why did he do that?	Näme üçin beýle etdi?
I didn't know, myself.	Bilmedim, özüm.
In fact, there was not much.	Aslynda köp zat ýokdy.
He is still there, somewhere.	Ol henizem şol ýerde, bir ýerde.
I'm not that worried.	Men beýle biynjalyk däl.
It could be today.	Bu gün hem bolup biler.
I was stupid.	Men samsyk boldum.
He said he could not speak.	Ol gürläp bilmeýändigini aýtdy.
It's not easy and it's not fast.	Bu aňsat däl we çalt däl.
He allowed it.	Oňa rugsat berdi.
I want to do it tonight.	Şu gije etmek isleýärin.
It was a wonderful night.	Bu ajaýyp gije boldy.
He can't help it.	Oňa kömek edip bilmeýän ýaly.
He did a lot for her.	Ol onuň üçin köp zat etdi.
I don't like that	Men muny halamok
It was like yesterday, but it was already there.	Düýn ýalydy, ýöne öňem bardy.
That's the way it is now.	Häzir şeýle.
This is not a good book either.	Bu hem gowy kitap däl.
He must have thought about it.	Bu hakda pikir eden bolmaly.
It would be a bit.	Biraz bolardy.
We have to tell you something.	Bize bir zat aýtmaly.
This is something else.	Bu başga zat.
I doubt this will happen.	Munuň boljakdygyna şübhelenýärin.
The answer is no.	Jogap beýle däl.
We can do it later.	Soň edip bileris.
He is not ready yet.	Ol entek taýyn däl.
He gave nothing.	Ol hiç zat bermedi.
I don't know anymore.	Indi bilemok.
I can't.	Men edip bilemok.
That's what happens.	Ine, şeýle bolýar.
He couldn't take it anymore.	Ol indi alyp bilmedi.
Now another.	Indi başga.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Men şeýle mümkinçilik berdim.
I know I can help you.	Bilýärin, size kömek edip bilerin.
This was not possible for him.	Onuň üçin bu mümkin däldi.
It was so bad to go that weekend.	Şol dynç güni gitmek gaty erbet boldy.
The problem.	Mesele.
There is a problem.	Bir mesele bar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu hakda pikir etmeli.
In fact, there are two ways to do this.	Aslynda munuň ýaly iki ýol bar.
He does not know how this happened.	Ol munuň nädip bolandygyny bilenok.
They are very good.	Olar gaty gowy.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
I still do.	Men henizem edýärin.
Man, they are beautiful.	Adam, olar owadan.
Of course not in the near future.	Elbetde ýakyn wagtda däl.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I have never seen one like this.	Munuň ýaly birini görmedim.
This is a big deal.	Bu bir uly mesele.
It could be good.	Gowy bolup biler.
It was fast.	Bu çalt boldy.
I was happy.	Men bagtly boldum.
What a crazy day.	Nähili däli gün.
He will do the right thing.	Dogry eder.
Worse, he knew it well.	Erbet, ol muny gowy bilýärdi.
I think it still exists.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol henizem bar.
He is as much as you are.	Ol seniň ýaly köp.
Of course it is.	Elbetde şeýle.
He was there now.	Ol indi bardy.
I thought it would work great.	Uly iş eder öýdüpdim.
I can't see.	Görüp bilemok.
I saw what happened.	Näme bolandygyny gördüm.
Everything is right and there really is.	Her bir zat dogry we hakykatdanam bar.
He is still gone.	Ol henizem gitdi.
They are my thing.	Olar meniň zadym.
I did not.	Men etmedim.
The problem is here.	Mesele şu ýerde.
It won't even be close.	Bu hatda ýakyn hem bolmaz.
Not here, not now, not so.	Bu ýerde däl, häzir däl, beýle däl.
He didn't really think about it.	Ol bu barada hakykatdanam pikir etmedi.
Only one person.	Diňe bir adam.
That's right.	Dogry.
It seemed like a good thing.	Gowy bir zat ýalydy.
I know.	Bilýärin.
Strange, he thought.	Geň, diýip pikir etdi.
This is for me too.	Bu hem meniň üçin.
This time the message came.	Bu gezek habar geldi.
Of course, this is not the only idea.	Elbetde, ýeke-täk pikir däl.
This was not what he did.	Bu onuň eden zady däldi.
This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
Here are two hundred.	Ine iki ýüz.
The problem seems to be too great.	Mesele gaty uly ýaly.
And then.	Soň bolsa.
We both need to rest.	Ikimizem dynç almaly.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
He was then.	Ol şol wagt.
He is very good to me.	Ol meniň üçin gaty gowy.
She looks happy.	Ol bagtly ýaly görünýär.
Of course, this was not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däldi.
It was already there.	Bu wagt öňem bardy.
OK, OK, OK.	Bolýar, bolýar, bolýar.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
The good news is, there is another way.	Gowy habar, başga bir ýol bar.
Something new.	Täze bir zat.
Now and then.	Indi we gowy.
It was short and short.	Gysga we gysga boldy.
I made good money	Gowy pul aldym
I think he says that.	Meniň pikirimçe, muny aýdýar.
He knew.	Ol bilýärdi.
This is always for you.	Bu hemişe siziň üçin.
The answer is different.	Jogap başga.
Bad, bad, bad.	Erbet, erbet, erbet.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
It seemed good.	Gowy ýalydy.
Of course, there was no answer.	Elbetde, jogap ýokdy.
This did not happen.	Bu bolup bilmedi.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
It's you.	Bu sen.
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
You are not with me	Sen meniň bilen däl
Must be only once.	Diňe bir gezek bolmaly.
I just think it's beautiful.	Diňe owadan diýip pikir edýärin.
What other way?	Başga haýsy ýol bar?
So they need us.	Şonuň üçin olar bize mätäç.
Not beautiful at all.	Asla owadan däl.
You can have your own fun.	Öz hezil edip bilersiňiz.
For money, this seemed like a good thing.	Pul üçin bu gaty gowy zat ýalydy.
There is really great advice out there.	Ol ýerde hakykatdanam ajaýyp maslahat bar.
He asked us a question.	Ol bize sorag berdi.
I know, obviously.	Bilýärin, aýdyň.
This, I think.	Bu, meniň pikirimçe.
This is another way to enjoy it.	Bu lezzet almak üçin başga bir ýol.
And then he thought.	Soň bolsa pikir etdi.
This will be a very difficult task.	Bu gaty kyn iş bolar.
Oh, that's interesting.	Aý, bu gyzykly.
I'm serious.	Men düýbünden çynlakaý.
That's all I have.	Ol meniň bar zadym.
I never did that again.	Men muny ýene etmedim.
It's not about destroying it.	Bu ony ýok etmek däl.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
Not to himself.	Özüne däl.
A little help would be a good thing right now.	Biraz kömek edil şu wagt gowy zat bolardy.
He will obey.	Ol boýun bolar.
Very good here.	Bu ýerde gaty gowy.
Everything is there.	Hemme zat bar.
The short answer is everyone.	Gysga jogap hemmeler.
I can't think of it.	Men muny pikir edip bilemok.
Just fast.	Edil çalt.
I didn't know, I didn't know.	Bilmedim, bilmedim.
They weren't really human to me.	Olar meniň üçin hakykatdanam adam ýaly däldi.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
In fact there is.	Aslynda bar.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
I really enjoyed it.	Men hakykatdanam lezzet aldym.
What should he do? 	Ol näme etmeli?
he asked.	diýip sorady.
I have to say that.	Muny aýtmaly.
I want two things at once.	Iki zady bir wagtda isleýärin.
Go, do it.	Bar, muny et.
He apologized.	Ol ötünç sorady.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
It was not a job for a fool.	Bu samsyk adam üçin iş däldi.
I need life.	Maňa durmuş gerek.
Good.	Gowy.
It was not as if he had seen me.	Ol meni gören ýaly däldi.
He can't do that.	Ol muny edip bilmeýär.
You again	Sen ýene
There was no other girl who could be.	Bolup biljek başga gyz ýokdy.
I tried this myself.	Muny özüm synap gördüm.
What happened	Näme boldy?
Two or three days is good.	Iki, üç gün gowy.
Is he there	Ol barmy?
They are almost there.	Olar diýen ýaly.
Of course he knows.	Elbetde bilýär.
Life will never be easy.	Durmuş hiç haçan aňsat bolmaz.
Probably, but not impossible.	Mümkin, ýöne mümkin däl.
The answer is nothing or everything.	Jogap hiç zat ýa-da hemme zat däl.
One night I didn't see much.	Bir agşam beýle köp zady görmedim.
For the first time, there is no answer.	Ilkinji gezek jogap ýok.
Now there are two possibilities.	Indi iki mümkinçilik bar.
It can be good, it can be bad.	Gowy bolup biler, erbet bolup biler.
This will never happen and will never happen.	Bu hiç haçan bolmaz we bolmaz.
He said he wanted to see you.	Seni görmek isleýändigini aýtdy.
Someone had to decide.	Kimdir biri karar bermeli boldy.
Really bad.	Hakykatdanam erbet.
Everything about him is right.	Ol hakda hemme zat dogry aýdýar.
It shouldn't be.	Bolmaly däl.
There has to be something here.	Bu ýerde birneme bolmaly.

Why good.	Näme üçin gowy.
No words.	Söz ýok.
This is asking you a question.	Bu sizi sorag edýär.

Okay.	Bolýar.

This is not a good thing.	Bu gowy zat däl.
And then the last question.	Soň bolsa soňky sorag.
This was not possible at all.	Bu düýbünden mümkin däldi.
He knew everything about her.	Ol ol hakda hemme zady bilýärdi.
She was worried again.	Ol ýene alada galdy.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
Of course, of course.	Elbetde, elbetde.

You don't have to do that.	Muny etmek hökman däl.

Something new this year.	Bu ýyl täze bir zat.
He couldn't get much.	Ol kän zat alyp bilmedi.
It's fast.	Bu çalt bolýar.

Oh, not at home.	Aý, öýde däl.
Of course for me.	Elbetde, meniň üçin.

He must have seen it.	Ony gören bolmaly.
I'm crazy, maybe.	Maňa däli, belki.
Until late at night.	Gijä çenli.
Three days.	Üç gün.
He doesn’t want or need money anymore.	Ol mundan başga pul islemeýär ýa-da gerek däl.
It seems to always be here.	Elmydama şu ýerde bolýan ýaly.
Good.	Gowy.
Of course, he didn't.	Elbetde, ol beýle zat etmedi.

Of course.	Elbetde.
It's as good as it gets now.	Edil häzirki ýaly gaty gowy.

Then he left again.	Soň bolsa ýene gitdi.
It will be interesting.	Gyzykly bolar.
Of course not.	Elbetde, ýokdy.
I told you the truth.	Men saňa bu hakda hakykaty aýtdym.

There are so many.	Ol ýerde gaty köp.
He is busy, but he agrees.	Ol meşgul, ýöne razy.
It's ready to go.	Bu gitmäge taýyn.
There seems to be a problem.	Mesele bar ýaly.
This is no longer true.	Bu indi dogry däl.
It will be interesting to see.	Muny görmek gyzykly bolar.
He never let me.	Ol maňa hiç wagt rugsat bermedi.
You will be.	Sen bolar.
For a while	Biraz wagt
And then, of course, it came out.	Soň bolsa, elbetde, çykdy.
That fact must be taken into account. "	Munuň özi size ol hakda bir zat aýdýar.
The meal was amazing.	Nahar geň boldy.

He gave you to us.	Ol seni bize berdi.

I've been with them for a week.	Men olar bilen bir hepde boldum.
Surprised.	Geň galdy.
There was only one thing about it.	Bu hakda diňe bir zat bardy.
No one bothered.	Hiç kim muny biynjalyk etmedi.
You have to get someone to help him.	Oňa kömek etjek birini almaly.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
He could see nothing now.	Ol indi hiç zady görüp bilmedi.
So it can be detrimental.	Şonuň üçin zyýan berip biler.
Great	Ajaýyp.
You have to hire him.	Ony işe almaly.
I couldn't do that.	Men muny edip bilmedim.
I don't need it.	Maňa gerek däl.
It was new.	Bu täze boldy.
.	.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
Too much money.	Pul gaty köp.
Stupid for work.	Iş üçin samsyk.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gaty dogry sorag.
He should do the same.	Ol hem edil şonuň ýaly etmeli.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Only you and I are there.	Diňe sen we men bar.
It was hard to decide.	Karar bermek kyn boldy.
Couldn't see it.	Ony görüp bilmedi.
He does.	Ol edýär.
Of course, everyone does that.	Elbetde, muny her kim edýär.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
He told me so.	Ol maňa şeýle diýdi.

It seems like a lot.	Bu gaty köp ýaly.
That's how life is.	Durmuş şeýle boldy.
Everyone else said it.	Başga hemmeler muny aýtdy.
It started badly.	Erbet başlady.
Everyone, everywhere.	Her kimiň, hemme ýerde.
I don't need permission	Maňa rugsat gerek däl
This is probably the first time.	Belki, bu ilkinji gezek boldy.
There is something for everyone here.	Bu ýerde hemmeler üçin bir zat bar.
There really was no other way.	Hakykatdanam başga ýol ýokdy.
He had to decide.	Ol karar bermeli boldy.
He has already taken you.	Ol eýýäm seni aldy.
Nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýok.
Because it’s not just him.	Sebäbi bu diňe özi däl.

Police did not allow him to leave.	Polisiýa oňa özi bilen gitmäge rugsat bermedi.
We have more.	Biz has köp.
He also sang.	Ol hem aýdym aýtdy.
There is a problem.	Mesele bar.
He just says whatever he wants.	Ol diňe islän zadyny aýdýar.
I'm sure it will be very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
I think about it.	Men ol hakda pikir edýärin.
This is very likely.	Bu gaty ähtimal.
He was not stupid about money.	Ol pul hakda samsyk däldi.
He is not.	Ol ýok.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
New money is always there.	Täze pul hemişe bolýar.
It was possible.	Bu mümkin boldy.
There are things to worry about.	Alada etmeli zatlary bar.
He is a man.	Ol adam.
It will.	Bu eder.
He is not good at it.	Ol muňa gowy däl.
No one.	Hiç kim ýok.
This will not be good for them or you.	Bu olar ýa-da siz üçin gowy bolmaz.
What a guy.	Nähili ýigit.
I couldn't sleep.	Men uklap bilmedim.
It looks great.	Ajaýyp görünýär.
Not good news at all.	Asla gowy habar däl.
Somewhat correct.	Biraz dogry.
Someone or something.	Kimdir biri ýa-da ol däl bir zat.
He did a lot for me.	Ol meniň üçin köp zat etdi.
We don't need that.	Bize beýle zat gerek däl.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
This is not the case at all.	Bu asla bir zat däl.

Here is the idea.	Ine iki pikir.

He has.	Ol bar.
He is not.	Ol ýok.
It was very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly boldy.
Now everything looks so good.	Häzir hemme zat gaty gowy görünýär.
This is not a good thing.	Munuň özi gowy zat däl.
They just have to be there for it.	Munuň üçin olar diňe bar.
Just a meal.	Diňe bir nahar.
The short answer is the opposite.	Gysga jogap, muňa garşy.
Nothing will happen to you.	Saňa hiç zat bolmaz.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
We are not against anyone.	Biz hiç kime garşy däl.
I could not give it.	Men muny berip bilmedim.
This is really strange.	Bu hakykatdanam geň.
Maybe it was time.	Belki, bu wagt boldy.
He is coming to us.	Ol bize gelýär.
There are actually two ideas.	Aslynda iki pikir bar.
He did better.	Ol has gowy etdi.
He is stupid.	Ol samsyk.
We have the time we need.	Bize gerek wagty bar.
You can talk.	Siz gürläp bilersiňiz.
Big girl	Uly gyz.
This is a good thing for almost everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin diýen ýaly gowy zat.
This is a big deal for everyone.	Bu her kim üçin gaty uly zat.
This is a good thing.	Bu gowy zat.
It's been a good year.	Gowy ýyl boldy.
I could do nothing about it.	Men bu barada hiç zat edip bilmedim.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hakykatdanam, hakykatdanam, bar zat.
It was good to see her happy.	Ony bagtly görmek gowy boldy.
I didn't know it was going to bother you.	Munuň sizi biynjalyk etjekdigini bilmedim.
About many things.	Köp zatlar hakda.
This is the problem, the problem.	Bu mesele, mesele.
So there may be one or two more.	Şonuň üçin ýene bir ýa-da iki bolup biler.
I have known for years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri bilýärin.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
She is beautiful, she is beautiful.	Ol ajaýyp, düýbünden ajaýyp.
This is difficult, but not impossible.	Bu kyn, ýöne mümkin däl.

He is right.	Ol muny dogry aýdýar.
It's easy to talk.	Gaty gürleşmek aňsat.
There seemed to be no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýok ýalydy.
A good voice was not enough.	Gowy ses ýeterlik däldi.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde onuň üçin hiç zat kän däldi.
Not just talking.	Diňe gürleşmek däl.
I can't do that alone.	Men muny ýeke özüm edip bilemok.
He did not say a word.	Ol bir söz aýtmady.
It was not a request as much as possible.	Mümkinçilik ýaly haýyş däldi.
He was fired.	Işden çykdy.
This is not smart.	Bu akylly däl.
What are you	Sen näme
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
Not bad, but worse.	Erbet däl, ýöne has erbet.
Maybe it shouldn't have been that way.	Belki beýle bolmaly däldi.
I need to	Men gerek
Maybe it will take more.	Belki has köp gerek bolar.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
There was something for that.	Munuň üçin bir zat bardy.
It comes every week.	Bu her hepde gelýär.
For this.	Munuň üçin.
I think that's possible.	Bu mümkin diýip pikir edýärin.
Okay, maybe not soon.	Bolýar, belki ýakyn wagtda bolmaz.
There is no time now.	Häzir wagt ýok.
I think about these things.	Men bu zatlar hakda pikir edýärin.
I thought now.	Men indi pikir etdim.
It helped me a lot.	Bu maňa gaty kömek etdi.
Not only that.	Diňe däl.
This is very serious.	Bu gaty çynlakaý.
They are one thing.	Olar bir zat.
No one can see it.	Ony hiç kim görüp bilmeýär.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu beýle däl ýaly.
It did something to him.	Bu oňa bir zat etdi.
This is a new day.	Bu täze gün.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde kyn zat ýok.
It was fun.	Bu gyzykly boldy.
This was not a big deal.	Bu kän bir mesele däldi.
Then there are the other things to do.	Soň etmeli başga zatlar hem bar.
Good.	Gowy.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolardy.
I think it's complete.	Meniň pikirimçe, doly boldy.
It's also about money.	Bu hem pul hakda.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
He seemed unhappy.	Ol bagtly däl ýalydy.
Everything is still there.	Hemme zat henizem.
It was not a big deal at the time.	Şol wagt bu uly bir zat däldi.
He can do it one day.	Bir gün edip biler.
The question is why?	Sorag näme üçin?
Okay.	Bolýar.
Sing a song	Bir aýdym aýtmak.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň, bagyşlaň.
You can do a lot with them.	Olar bilen köp zat edip bilersiňiz.
It was not the best idea.	Iň gowy pikir däldi.
I have no idea.	Bu barada hiç hili pikir ýok.
Once upon a time.	Bir gezek.
It still exists.	Ol henizem bar.
It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
Then he fell asleep.	Soň bolsa uklap galdy.
He knows nothing about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat bilmez.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
It happened.	Ol boldy.
He said.	Diýdi.
I can't do that	Men muny edip bilemok
Someone already existed.	Biri eýýäm bardy.
I didn't know anything else.	Men başga zady bilmeýärdim.
I can give it to you.	Men size berip bilerin.
There was something else.	Başga bir zat hem bardy.
I thought it looked great.	Gaty gowy görünýär öýdüpdim.
He can't get it.	Ol alyp bilmeýär.
One night tonight	Bu gije bir gije.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Of course, one concern.	Elbetde, bir alada.
The time is too short.	Wagt gaty gysga.
And very good.	We gaty gowy.
Of course you have to rest.	Elbetde, dynç almaly.
Now this seems very strange.	Indi bu gaty geň görünýär.
He thought it might be someone.	Kimdir biri bolup biler diýip pikir etdi.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
She is having fun.	Ol hezil edýär.
You already know that.	Muny eýýäm bilýärsiň.
I couldn't see it.	Men ony görüp bilmedim.
He did not answer me.	Ol maňa jogap bermedi.
One is left	Biri galdy
Whatever it is, it is never enough.	Näme bolsa we näme bolsa, hiç wagt ýeterlik däl.
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
He had to leave early.	Ol ir gitmeli boldy.
I can't be here all day.	Men bu ýerde bütin gün bolup bilemok.
You are not ready yet.	Siz entek taýyn däl.
I had money.	Mende pul bardy.
I will never be like that.	Men hiç wagt beýle bolmaz.
No idea.	Asla pikir ýok.
I think that's great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty gowy.
He may be there.	Ol şol ýerde bolup biler.
What happens	Näme bolýar.
He would be alone there.	Ol şol ýerde ýeke bolardy.
There is plenty of time for that.	Munuň üçin köp wagt bar.
Of course.	Elbetde.
At present, this seems to be the case.	Häzirki wagtda munuň dogry bolmagy mümkin ýalydy.
He also asked for an answer.	Şeýle hem, jogap isledi.
You can try it.	Synap görüp bilersiňiz.
I don’t believe it and I don’t believe it.	Men ynanamok we ynanamok.
I saw it myself.	Men muny özüm gördüm.
I can't do anything about it.	Men bu barada hiç zat edip bilemok.
I'm sorry, please.	Bagyşlaň, haýyş.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
He could not sleep.	Ol uklap bilmedi.
Now to do that.	Indi muny etmek üçin.
Maybe something else.	Belki başga zat.
It will not happen immediately.	Derrew bolmaz.
I was alone.	Men ýeke boldum.
The most beautiful day.	Iň ajaýyp gün.
You were never with me.	Sen meniň bilen asla ýokdy.
Someone is on the ground.	Kimdir biri ýerde.
That's a good thing.	Gowy bir zat.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It could be better.	Has gowy bolup biler.
Worse.	Has erbet.
He said he was not there.	Ol ol ýerde ýokdugyny aýtdy.
He could see now.	Ol indi görüp bilýärdi.
It will be clearer tomorrow.	Ertir has aýdyň bolar.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I saw it immediately.	Men ony derrew gördüm.
Maybe it won't be so bad for them.	Belki, olar üçin beýle erbet bolmaz.
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
There may be several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bolup biler.
It could be bad.	Erbet bolup biler.
This is more likely.	Bu has ähtimal.
You are like me	Sen meniň ýaly
This is not a question.	Bu sorag däl.
Not a bad person.	Erbet adam däl.
It is in a short place.	Ol gysga ýerde.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
He didn't know anymore.	Ol indi bilmeýärdi.
There is someone there.	Ol ýerde kimdir biri bar.
He did it and it's great.	Muny etdi we gaty gowy.
This is a very good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat.
Maybe very difficult.	Belki gaty kyn.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
They are just crazy.	Olar diňe däli.
In two places, there will be three in the near future.	Iki ýerde bolsa, ýakyn wagtda üç bolar.
I think it's from me.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu menden.
I don't want a problem.	Men kynçylyk islämok.
I don't want to go home.	Men öýe gitmek islämok.
Let me know	Maňa habar bermek
I am against it.	Men muňa garşy.
He was not there yet.	Ol henizem ýokdy.
Not often, but enough.	Köplenç däl, ýöne ýeterlik.
He did nothing for her.	Oňa hiç zat etmedi.
There was nothing easy about it.	Bu barada aňsat zat ýokdy.
Then you can help.	Soň kömek edip bilersiňiz.
These things took time.	Bu zatlar wagt aldy.
Of course that would be the case.	Elbetde bu iş bolardy.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
This was not good either.	Bu hem gowy däldi.
This is probably a bad idea.	Bu erbet pikir bolsa gerek.
He was alone.	Ol ýeke boldy.
Forgive him.	Ony bagyşlaň.
This is not far off.	Bu uzak däl.
This is not interesting either.	Bu hem gyzykly däl.
I can do that a lot.	Men muny köp edip bilerin.
About the future.	Geljek hakda.
It was really good.	Hakykatdanam gaty gowy boldy.
Then it was all over.	Soň hemmeler boldy.
I hope it's good.	Gowy diýip umyt edýärin.
I did today.	Şu gün etdim.
He did not say anything.	Ol hiç zat aýtmady.
Tell me.	Aýdyň.
It took more time.	Oňa has köp wagt gerek boldy.
He did it once.	Ol muny bir gezek etdi.
Now he didn't want to talk to her or see her.	Häzir onuň bilen gürleşmek ýa-da görmek islemedi.
Everything looks right.	Hemme zat dogry görünýär.
We can't do that.	Muny edip bilmeris.
We have to go.	Biz gitmeli.
This is a very serious mistake.	Bu gaty çynlakaý ýalňyşlyk.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
I suggested here.	Men şu ýerde teklip etdim.
She was worried.	Ony biynjalyk etdi.
No problem.	Hiç hili mesele ýok.
That can't be good.	Munuň gowy bolup bilmez.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I didn't even have to be there.	Men hatda ol ýerde bolmaly däldim.
Time bought.	Wagt satyn aldy.
They are not.	Olar beýle däl.
He can get married today.	Bu gün durmuş alyp biler.
With a little	Biraz bilen.
I told her I could do it, of course.	Men oňa elbetde edip biljekdigini aýtdym.
One year	Bir ýyl
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
Of course.	Elbetde.
There was only one life.	Diňe bir durmuş bardy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, bu ýerde gaty gyzykly bolýar.
I think it takes a lot of work.	Biraz köp iş gerek diýip pikir edýärin.
It's hard to say for sure.	Başga zatlar üçin muny aýtmak has kyn.
I did it now.	Men indi etdim.
This was not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däldi.
He was crazy.	Ol däli boldy.
He could not take it with him.	Ol özi bilen alyp bilmedi.
That's the way it is.	Ol ýol.
The time was good.	Wagty gowy boldy.
Nowadays, almost no one does.	Häzirki wagtda hiç kim diýen ýaly etmeýär.
Nothing like that will ever happen.	Hiç zat munuň ýaly bolmaz.
He hoped he could do better.	Has gowy biljekdigine umyt etdi.
He wants to see it.	Ol muny görmek isleýär.
He helps us.	Ol bize kömek edýär.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Häzirki wagtda geldi.
Monday for purchase.	Satyn almak üçin duşenbe.
That's a lot.	Gaty zat.
I have seen this several times.	Men muny birnäçe gezek gördüm.
This does not exist.	Bu bar däl.
This is something else, something completely new.	Bu başga bir zat, düýbünden täze zat.
Something else is here.	Bu ýerde başga zat.
That day is coming very fast.	Şol gün gaty çalt gelýär.
It was a really interesting answer.	Hakykatdanam gyzykly jogap berdi.
Almost anyone can say anything.	Her kim diýen ýaly bir zat aýdyp biler.
It's one o'clock.	Sagat bir.

One day he said he wanted more.	Bir gün ol has köp zat isleýändigini aýtdy.
He thought it was interesting.	Gyzykly, diýip pikir etdi.
I have never seen one like this.	Munuň ýaly birini görmedim.
The reason is elsewhere.	Munuň sebäbi başga ýerde.
That didn't help.	Bu birneme kömek etmedi.
This is a good police job.	Bu gowy polisiýa işi.
Not for a while.	Biraz wagt däl.
Another job, but that’s it.	Başga bir iş, ýöne ol şol.
He is crazy, really crazy.	Ol däli, hakykatdanam däli.

This is not easy.	Bu aňsat däl.
He took everything.	Bar zadyny aldy.
It didn't hurt me.	Bu maňa zyýan bermedi.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
No one helped me.	Hiç kim maňa kömek etmedi.
He was not like anyone before.	Ozal hiç kim ýaly däldi.
It was not necessary for us.	Bu biziň üçin zerur däldi.
You have to do it, you have to do it.	Muny etmeli, bu işi etmeli.
It came at the right time.	Dogry wagtda geldi.
Of course, he didn't want to hurt her.	Elbetde, oňa zyýan bermek islemedi.
I am human.	Men adam.
This is not possible at all.	Bu düýbünden mümkin däl.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I don't know what he wants.	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilemok.
Who else.	Kim başga.
There would only be two.	Diňe iki bolardy.
It's been a while	Biraz wagt boldy
Oh.	Aý.
It doesn't seem like a big deal.	Bu uly zat däl ýaly.
This book.	Bu kitap.
No permission.	Rugsat ýok.
He wants more.	Has köp zady isleýär.
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
Now he knew what to do.	Indi näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
This is a big mistake.	Bu gaty ýalňyşlyk.
Great for summer.	Tomus üçin gaty gowy.
It's out now.	Indi çykdy.
He stayed one night.	Ol bir gije galdy.
This one is different.	Bu biri başga.
Stop it now	Indi muny bes et.
Everything was fast.	Hemme zat çalt boldy.
So that’s interesting.	Şonuň üçin bu gyzykly.
I have nothing to do.	Meniň etjek zadym ýok.
I don't trust you at all.	Men saňa asla ynanamok.
They are no more.	Indi olar ýok.
There are many, many things that can be done.	Muny edip biljek köp, köp zat bar.
It's too bad at night.	Gije gaty erbet.
That should not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däldi.
He was worried.	Ol alada etdi.
Because it could happen again.	Sebäbi bu ýene bolup biler.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty gowy boldy.
I don't know any other way.	Başga ýol bilemok.
He said you know.	Ol bilýärsiň diýdi.
Almost there! 	Ol ýerde diýen ýaly!
Speak loudly.	Gaty ses bilen aýdyň.
No one knows the truth.	Hiç kim hakykaty bilenok.
I don't have to see anything.	Maňa hiç zat görmek hökman däl.
He was there.	Ol ýerde bardy.
Not big, but different.	Uly däl, ýöne başga.
There is no interesting way.	Gyzykly ýol ýok.
I know better now.	Men indi has gowy bilýärin.
.	.
He was really crazy.	Ol hakykatdanam däli boldy.
Who am i	Men kim
Life only lives.	Durmuş diňe ýaşaýar.
Because it is.	Sebäbi şeýle.
Why did he?	Näme üçin etdi?
I can help you.	Size kömek edip bilerin.
He was wrong, he knew it.	Dogry däldi, muny bilýärdi.
Best night ever	Iň gowy gije.
Maybe next week.	Belki indiki hepde.
I miss you so much	Men seni gaty isleýärin
He gave it to her.	Ol oňa berdi.
Man is always and somewhere else.	Adam hemişe we başga ýerde.
We are here.	Biz şu ýerde.
This year is really bad.	Bu ýyl hakykatdanam erbet.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ol şeýle pikir etmeli.
I'll call the police.	Polisiýa jaň ederin.
Only they.	Diňe olar.
Agree to do.	Etmäge razy.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
We are together	Biz bile.
Could be a better one.	Has gowy biri bolup biler.
This is really important to me.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň üçin zerur.
The former is now a lie.	Öňküsi indi ýalan.
It's great to see you again.	Seni ýene görmek gaty gowy zat.
I don't like it anymore	Indi meni halamok
Everything is right, here.	Hemme zat dogry, şu ýerde.
Not so young.	Şeýle ýaş däl.
You know, like, saltines and their ilk, eh?	Bilýärsiň, ol gowy adam.
We can't do that anymore.	Indi muny edip bilmeris.
Isn't it right now?	Edil şu wagt dälmi?
I am very sorry.	Men gaty gynanýaryn.
I need to do something.	Maňa bir zat etmegi gerek.
It can even be good.	Ol hatda gowy bolup biler.
I couldn't be happier.	Bagtly bolup bilmedim.
We have to make a big decision.	Biz gaty karar bermeli.
This should not be so difficult.	Bu beýle kyn bolmaly däl.
You have to do something about it.	Bu hakda hiç zat etmeli däl.
He wanted to.	Ol isledi .
Hard day	Kyn gün.
There is no answer at all.	Asla jogap ýok.
I think that's it.	Bu meniň pikirimçe.
Not good, but good.	Gowy däl, ýöne gowy.
Something worries you.	Bir zat sizi biynjalyk edýär.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
I found it strange.	Men muny geň gördüm.
He also reported the matter to police.	Ol hem polisiýa habar berdi.
Everything was fast.	Hemme zat çalt boldy.
It's very difficult now.	Häzir gaty kyn.
I think for a long time.	Men uzak pikir edýärin.
I think there is no answer.	Jogap ýok diýip pikir edýärin.
It's been a long time.	Bu uzak wagt.
Oh, that's bad.	Aý, ol erbet.
You have to do it for them.	Muny olar üçin etmeli.
I know it can't happen.	Bolup bilmejekdigini bilýärin.
Okay.	Bolýar.
There will never be a good thing there.	Ol ýerde hiç wagt gowy zat bolmaz.
It's been a long night.	Gije köp boldy.
He must have known it best, he knew it.	Ol muny iň gowy bilýän bolmaly, muny bilýärdi.
I think that's just me.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu diňe meniň bilen galdy.
Besides, he had nothing.	Mundan başga, onuň asla hiç zady ýokdy.
He called me several times.	Ol maňa birnäçe gezek jaň etdi.
You can do this yourself.	Muny özüňiz edip bilersiňiz.
It took him a few weeks.	Oňa birnäçe hepde gerek boldy.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
This is a problem.	Bu mesele.
It was very fast.	Bu gaty çalt boldy.
Just like last year.	Geçen ýyl ýaly.
There was no time at that time.	Şol wagt wagt ýokdy.
It was bad.	Bu erbet boldy.
No one promised.	Hiç kim söz bermedi.
It will be good, it will be bad.	Gowy bolar, erbet bolar.
This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
This decision was correct.	Bu karar dogry boldy.
I was not surprised.	Men geň görmedim.
The weekend was crazy.	Dynç güni däli boldy.
Now more people know that.	Indi muny has köp adam bilýär.
Necessary thing.	Zerur zat.
It's just me.	Bu diňe men.
I don't like you and I don't like you.	Men seni halamok we halamok.
So something could happen.	Şonuň üçin bir zat bolup biler.
In fact, he did it twice.	Aslynda muny iki gezek etdi.
This is not really smart.	Bu hakykatdanam akylly däl.
I have to go home, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Men öýe gitmeli "-diýdi.
It's really easy.	Bu hakykatdanam aňsat.
He never did and never will.	Hiç haçan etmedi we bolmaz.
They have to be there.	Olar ol ýerde bolmaly.
Of course, this is for me.	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin.
There is something wrong here.	Bu ýerde dogry däl bir zat bar.
OK! 	Bolýar!
Nothing was ever needed.	Hiç haçan hiç zat gerek däldi.
Only here.	Diňe şu ýerde.
He didn't pay much attention to me.	Ol maňa kän bir üns bermedi.
I don't know anything about that.	Men bu hakda hiç zat bilemok.
He knew everything.	Ol hemme zady bilýärdi.
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
he thought.	diýip pikir etdi.
No more there.	Indi ol ýerde asla ýok.
This seems impossible.	Bu mümkin däl ýaly bolup görünýär.
It didn't hurt.	Zyýan bermedi.
This was not the case at all.	Munuň özi düýbünden däldi.
This is the reality of life.	Bu durmuş hakykaty.
He did not allow her to think so.	Özüniň beýle pikir etmegine ýol bermedi.
I don't know what happened to him.	Oňa näme bolandygyny bilemok.
Must admit.	Boýun almaly.
To know what to do.	Näme etmelidigini bilmek üçin.
I can go home.	Men öýe gidip bilerin.
I am not myself.	Men özüm däl.
It should be, but it is not.	Şeýle bolmaly, ýöne beýle däl.
He should not have been there.	Ol ol ýerde bolmaly däldi.
We both have to.	Ikimizem etmeli.
There was nothing else I could do now.	Indi edip biljek başga zady ýokdy.
There was a reason for this and there is.	Munuň bir sebäbi bardy we bar.
He responded immediately.	Ol derrew jogap berdi.
So it takes time.	Şonuň üçin wagt gerek.
Good, good guy.	Gowy, gowy ýigit.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
I'm not alone.	Men asla ýeke däl.
He can't help himself.	Özüne kömek edip bilmez.
It didn't work out for me.	Bu meni islemedi.
There is no such thing.	Munuň ýaly zat ýok.
It was a good decision.	Bu gowy karar boldy.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I've never done that before.	Muny öň etmedim.
This is for me.	Meniň üçin bu.
You have to do this once.	Muny bir gezek etmeli.
How many opportunities are there now?	Indi näçe mümkinçilik bar?
This.	Iki.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolardy.
There is no answer.	Jogap bolmaz.
He did not always say a word.	Ol hemişe bir söz aýtmady.
Couldn't be.	Bolup bilmedi.
He did.	Ol etdi.
I can't say when.	Haçan aýdyp biljek däl.
Police are everywhere.	Polisiýa hemme ýerde.
No more people.	Indi adam ýok.
This is not true at all.	Bu düýbünden dogry däl.
Too many people do that.	Muny gaty köp adam edýär.
That was not always the case.	Elmydama beýle däldi.
He didn't have much to do.	Ol etmeli köp zat däldi.
I answered.	Men jogap berdim.
I knew it could happen.	Munuň bolup biljekdigini bilýärdim.
I hope it's good.	Gowy diýip umyt edýärin.
It was not good enough.	Gowy ýeterlik däldi.
It will be very difficult to do that.	Muny etmek gaty kyn bolar.
He gave us everything.	Bar zadyny bize berdi.
Someone else.	Başga biri.
Okay.	Bolýar.
There is no question about that at all.	Bu hakda düýbünden sorag ýok.
Also.	Şeýle hem.
He did not want to do that.	Ol muny etmek islemedi.
This is good news.	Bu gyzykly habar.
Of course, this is too much.	Elbetde, bu gaty köp.
Only you weren't there.	Diňe sen ýokdy.
Several times even.	Birnäçe gezek hatda.
We have to decide.	Biz karar bermeli.
No more.	Indi ýok.
And then it got worse.	Soň bolsa erbet boldy.
It still helps.	Bu henizem kömek edýär.
Not for me.	Meniň üçin däl.
I think it's good.	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
This was not really possible.	Bu hakykatdanam mümkin däldi.
We are in a very different place.	Biz gaty başga ýerde.
I did it very well.	Men muny gaty gowy etdim.
In fact, it used to be impossible.	Aslynda ozal hiç hili mümkinçilik ýokdy.
It wasn't just here.	Edil edil şu ýerde däldi.
I want to make you happy.	Men sizi bagtly etmek isleýärin.
Not there	Ol ýerde ýok
This is his first job.	Bu onuň ilkinji işi.
Everyone knows that.	Muny hemmeler bilýär.
Very young man.	Gaty ýigit.
He did it again.	Ol ýene etdi.
You have an offer.	Size teklip bar.
I could not go	Men gidip bilmedim
I just couldn’t get it today.	Men diňe şu gün alyp bilmedim.
He couldn't get it all.	Ol hemmesini alyp bilmedi.
I was not in a good place.	Men gowy ýerde däldim.
He could not say.	Ol aýdyp bilmedi.
He was not against it.	Ol muňa garşy däldi.
Good.	Gowy.
He knew.	Ol bilýärdi.
I knew it was going to be a big deal.	Munuň uly zat boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
I promised him.	Men oňa söz berdim.
Now he has taken me.	Indi ol meni aldy.
I must be able to see.	Men görüp bilýän bolmaly.
he says.	ol aýdýar.
This is us.	Bu biz.
He said something in his own language.	Öz dilinde bir zat aýtdy.
Now I know what can't happen.	Näme bolup bilmejekdigini indi bilýärin.
It’s not a beautiful face, but it’s not bad.	Bu owadan ýüz däl, ýöne erbet däl.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Such an opportunity.	Şeýle mümkinçilik.
He was a little crazy.	Biraz däli boldy.
I have nothing to do.	Etjek zady ýok.
A lot of work.	Köp iş.
He seemed to be able to do more with his time.	Wagty bilen has köp zat edip bilýän ýalydy.
So there must be another way.	Şonuň üçin başga bir ýol bolmaly.
It was not necessary for me.	Bu meniň üçin zerur däldi.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
He would be.	Ol bolardy.
Often alone would be nice, but not at all.	Köplenç ýeke özi gowy bolardy, ýöne düýbünden däl.
It was great to see.	Görmek gaty gowy boldy.
It seems impossible now.	Bu indi mümkin däl ýaly.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
I didn't want to see that.	Men muny görmek islemedim.
It's been a long time.	Ol ýerde köp wagt boldy.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmeli däl.
Nor is it.	Şeýle hem ýok.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
One day it would be good.	Bir gün gowy bolardy.
I'm not coming	Men gelenok
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
He thought I could go.	Men gidip bilerin diýip pikir etdi.
Someone can say something.	Kimdir biri bir zat aýdyp biler.
It's not me.	Bu men däl.
Really hard to say.	Hakykatdanam aýtmak kyn.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň zady.
He said something.	Ol bir zat diýdi.
It was not quick or easy.	Bu çalt ýa-da aňsat däldi.
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa rugsat bermedi.
We are not really smart.	Biz hakykatdanam gaty akylly däl.
I always think so.	Men elmydama şeýle pikir edýärin.
He is not.	Ol däl.
He could see it all.	Ol hemmesini görüp bilýärdi.
You can see it for yourself.	Muny özüňiz görüp bilersiňiz.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki, bir ýerde bar bolsa gerek.
This is really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet.
I still didn't want to go.	Men henizem gitmek islemedim.
The message was difficult.	Habar kyn boldy.
Almost everything seems to be.	Hemme zat diýen ýaly bolup görünýär.
This was not the case.	Muny etmek beýle däldi.
Of course it should be.	Elbetde bolmaly.
This can only happen.	Bu diňe bolup biler.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
The problem is not money.	Mesele pul däl.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
He has already received the news.	Ol eýýäm habar galdy.
It looks great.	Gaty gowy görünýär.
Really	Hakykatdanam.
This is still great.	Bu henizem ajaýyp.
Life is not against us.	Durmuş bize garşy däl.
You are here	Sen şu ýerde
I'm scared.	Men gorkýaryn.
This is another day.	Bu başga bir gün.
I really want to.	Men gaty isleýärin.
He did not.	Ol beýle etmedi.
You have to admit it exists once or twice.	Bir ýa-da iki gezek bardygyny boýun almaly.
To be big	Uly bolmak
I said the same thing.	Men şol bir zady aýtdym.
This is not a lie at all.	Bu düýbünden ýalan däl.
He did not intend to take anyone away.	Ol hiç kimi alyp gitmegi pikir etmedi.
I did something stupid yesterday.	Düýn samsyk bir zat etdim.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
It looks better.	Ol has gowy görünýär.
Something was wrong with that.	Bu barada bir zat dogry däldi.
Now that's a good word.	Indi bu gowy söz.
I told the truth.	Men hakykaty aýtdym.
She had to get help right away.	Derrew kömek almaly boldy.
He had a bad rest.	Erbet dynç aldy.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
Obedience to it.	Oňa boýun bolmak.
And then a little more.	Soň bolsa ýene birneme.
It will be easier.	Bu has aňsat bolar.
Only.	Diňe.
The same	Şol bir.
Good.	Gowy.
This is not a thing.	Bu bir zat däl.
This is not a thing.	Bu bir zat däl.
This is just for us.	Bu diňe biziň üçin.
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
I had a little rest.	Biraz dynç aldym.
He is no more.	Ol indi ýok.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
It tells you a lot here.	Bu ýerde size gaty köp zat aýdýar.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
It was good to say that.	Muny aýtmak gowy boldy.
It wasn't bad.	Erbet däldi.
I think you can tell.	Aýdyp bilersiňiz öýdýän.
Of course he did.	Elbetde, oňa berdi.
That man called us several times.	Ol adam bize birnäçe gezek jaň etdi.
I didn't think about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim.
He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
I can decide to do those things.	Men ol zatlary etmegi karar edip bilerin.
So fast	Şeýle çalt.
You can do it, but you can do it.	Muny edip bilersiňiz, ýöne hökman edip bilersiňiz.
There was something.	Bir zat bardy.
This was very true.	Bu gaty dogry boldy.
Almost everything.	Hemme zat diýen ýaly.
It's always great.	Elmydama ajaýyp.
For this.	Munuň üçin.
Maybe not tomorrow, but soon.	Belki ertir däl, ýöne ýakyn wagtda.
They are not like you or me.	Olar sen ýa-da meniň ýaly däl.
Not just this time, but before.	Diňe bu gezek däl, öňem.
I'll call him.	Men oňa jaň ederin.
He could see everything.	Ol hemme zady görüp bilýärdi.
That would be great.	Bu uly bolardy.
I had money.	Mende pul bardy.
This is not serious at all.	Bu düýbünden çynlakaý däl.
He didn't bother anyone.	Ol hiç kimi biynjalyk etmedi.
He is not coming.	Ol gelenok.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
I was the only one here.	Men bu ýerde ýeke özüm boldum.
I want to answer that.	Men muňa jogap bermek isleýärin.
Everyone needs it.	Munuň üçin hemmeler gerek.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
The question is when, if not.	Sorag haçan, ýok bolsa.
This is his only business.	Bu onuň ýeke-täk işi.
You can't go home anymore.	Indi öýe gaýdyp bolmaz.
Everything looks new and fresh.	Hemme zat täze we täze görünýär.
He did not say anything about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat aýtmady.
No one knows.	Bu barada hiç kim bilmez.
He can sleep here.	Ol şu ýerde uklap bilýär.
Mary was not the same girl.	Merýem şol bir gyz däldi.
It was short and short.	Gysga we gysga boldy.
You are the only one, the last.	Sen ýeke-täk, iň soňky.
Anything can happen.	Islän zady bolup biler.
This idea is very fast.	Bu pikir gaty çalt.
It really helped.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek etdi.
Tell us the truth.	Bize hakykaty aýdyň.
Can be purchased.	Satyn alyp bolýar.
Everyone knew that.	Muny hemmeler bilýärdi.
He did.	Ol etdi.
He took it and agreed.	Ol muny aldy we razy boldy.
Oh, absolutely.	Aý, düýbünden boldy.
I'm actually fine.	Men aslynda gowy.
I'm not going to do that	Men muny etjek däl
It was a great day.	Bu ajaýyp gün boldy.
Who was not.	Kim beýle däldi.
I think that's smart.	Bu akylly diýip pikir edýärin.
He didn't need anything for it.	Munuň üçin oňa hiç zat gerek däldi.
He was right.	Ol gaty dogry aýtdy.
I know how to do the right thing.	Dogry zady nädip etmelidigini bilýärin.
He left this morning.	Şu gün irden çykdy.
He can't.	Ol edip bilmeýär.
I need it very badly.	Maňa gaty erbet gerek.
There could be more to it than that.	Aslynda mundan has köp zat bolup biler.
I can't say enough about it.	Men bu hakda ýeterlik zat aýdyp biljek däl.
We'll know better next time.	Indiki gezek has gowy bileris.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
I'll be fine with you.	Men saňa gowy bolaryn.
Last but not least.	Iň soňky.

Tell me something.	Maňa bir zat aýdyň.
No words.	Söz ýok.
He agreed with me.	Ol meniň bilen razy boldy.
It must be.	Bu hökman bolmaly.
I can't see anything.	Men hiç zady görüp bilemok.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
He said there.	Ol ýerde aýtdy.
It could be.	Ol bolup biler.
That doesn't seem to be the case with me.	Bu meniň üçin beýle däl ýaly.
There is madness here.	Bu ýerde däli bar.
He said it was not so bad.	Ol beýle erbet däl diýdi.
You don't have to pay attention to it.	Oňa üns bermeli däl.
He just wanted to vote.	Ol diňe ses bermek isledi.
Today was a great day.	Bu gün gaty uly gün boldy.
Someone was with him.	Kimdir biri onuň bilen bardy.
What would it be like.	Bu nähili bolardy.
It was like everyone else.	Hemmeler ýalydy.
It is in a very difficult place.	Ol gaty kyn ýerde.
I thought about everything.	Men hemme zat hakda pikir etdim.
I know it's not complete.	Doly däldigini bilýärin.
Now with you	Indi seniň bilen.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
He helped make me a better person.	Ol meni has gowy adam etmäge kömek etdi.
We can worry about money.	Pul hakda alada edip bileris.
Even that may not be enough.	Hatda bu ýeterlik däl bolup biler.
This will help a lot.	Bu köp kömek eder.
He went for the first time in a week.	Ol ilkinji gezek bir hepde gitdi.
He must have been worried about the police.	Polisiýa barada alada eden bolmaly.
This is something else.	Bu başga zat.
There were no good things.	Gowy zatlar ýokdy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
What a day	Nähili gün.
What a strange man he is.	Ol nähili geň adam.
It always has, maybe, but it's different.	Elmydama bardy, mümkin, ýöne bu başga.
You may be next.	Indiki bolup bilersiňiz.
This is for you.	Bu siziň üçin.
I may need it.	Maňa gerek bolup biler.
You have to do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly etmeli.
Just a bad day, a hard day.	Diňe erbet gün, kyn gün.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
Only no one can do that.	Diňe muny hiç kim edip bilmez.
This is easier said than done.	Bu adam üçin has aňsat.
And then something else happened.	Soň bolsa başga bir zat boldy.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
You have to go immediately.	Derrew gitmeli.
In fact, it's not just money.	Hakykatdanam, bu diňe pul däl.
He said he did not want to see me again.	Ol meni ýene görmek islemeýändigini aýtdy.
I'm not like that yet.	Men henizem beýle däl.
I didn’t care about them.	Men olar hakda alada etmedim.
There will be no problems.	Hiç hili kynçylyk bolmaz.
I never saw anything but fun.	Hiç haçan hezil etmekden başga zat görmedim.
He wanted to say something else.	Başga bir zat aýtmak isledi.
I don't think there can be that much.	Beýle köp bolup biler öýdemok.
He took her away.	Ol ony alyp gitdi.
It was time.	Bu wagt boldy.
No news yet.	Entek habar ýok.
It will.	Bu eder.
Two years ago.	Iki ýyl mundan ozal.
I don't want that	Men muny islämok
He said I could do better than you.	Ol senden has gowy edip bilerin diýdi.
Time is running out.	Wagt çalt gitdi.
There is always a sound.	Elmydama ses bolýar.
This is probably not necessary.	Bu zerur däl bolsa gerek.
It doesn't have to be long.	Uzak bolmaly däl.
This can be difficult.	Muny etmek kyn bolup biler.
Really good.	Hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
He was like you.	Ol seniň ýalydy.
Tell me what it will be like.	Onuň nähili boljakdygyny aýdyň.
I didn't mind that much.	Men muňa kän bir garşy däldim.
There must be something if you need money.	Pul gerek bolsa bir zat bolmaly.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däl.
This is not for everyone.	Bu hemmeler üçin däl.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe gowy bermeli.
He wanted to do something.	Ol bir zat etmek isledi.
It will be good for us.	Bu biziň üçin gowy bolar.
He could not buy.	Ol satyn alyp bilmedi.
He only went one night.	Ol diňe bir gije gitdi.
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
It was like a little.	Ol birneme ýalydy.
I didn't think about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim.
A few days are good.	Birnäçe gün gowy.
He made her crazy.	Ony däli etdi.
Et.	Et.
He himself suggested this to me.	Özi muny maňa teklip etdi.
He will have fun.	Ol hezil eder.
An issue, an idea.	Bir mesele, pikir.
He knows, enough.	Bilýär, ýeterlik.
There is absolutely no good reason for this.	Munuň üçin düýbünden gowy sebäp ýok.
It's over now.	Bu indi boldy.
It was with me everywhere.	Meniň bilen hemme ýerde boldy.
.	.
I hope this doesn't happen to anyone.	Bu hiç kim üçin beýle bolmaz diýip umyt edýärin.
Maybe he knows that.	Belki, muny bilýän bolsa gerek.
There will be more.	Has köp zat bolar.
It's really good.	Aslynda gaty gowy.
Something else can happen.	Başga bir zat bolup biler.
Everything.	Hemme zat.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
Okay.	Bolýar.
So are we.	Ikimizem şeýle.
I hope you are well and happy.	Gowy we bagtly bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin.
Tell him it's really nothing.	Oňa hakykatdanam hiç zat däldigini aýdyň.
Maybe I think about it a lot.	Belki, bu hakda gaty köp pikir edýärin.
This is really me.	Bu hakykatdanam men.
The book is beautiful.	Kitap owadan.
There was a word for that.	Munuň üçin bir söz bardy.
So things can't go wrong.	Şonuň üçin zatlar erbet bolup bilmez.
It's long gone.	Uzak gitdi.
It's back now.	Indi gaýdyp geldi.
Not a day like this.	Munuň ýaly gün däl.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
You don't have to do too much.	Gaty köp zat etmeli däl.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
I am with the police.	Men polisiýa bilen.
It's also easy to get there.	Ol ýere gitmek hem aňsat.
Everyone knows that tomorrow.	Her kim muny ertir bilýär.
We can't say enough.	Muny ýeterlik aýdyp bilmeris.
No further damage is required.	Mundan başga zyýan gerek däl.
There were only a few issues.	Diňe birnäçe mesele bardy.
Maybe not bad.	Belki erbet däl bolsa gerek.
Try something right.	Bir zady dogry synap görmek.
There is a saying like this.	Munuň ýaly söz bar.
All you have to do is call it.	Bar etmeli zady, oňa jaň etmek.
Not yet, not later.	Entek däl, soň däl.
I think he can do that.	Muny edip biler diýip pikir edýärin.
Not much with me.	Meniň bilen kän däl.
I always knew that.	Men muny hemişe bilýärdim.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty ajaýyp.
Even if it exists at all.	Hatda düýbünden bar bolsa.
Not so next time.	Indiki gezek beýle däl.
That was not the case at all.	Bu asla mesele däldi.
She is with a guy.	Ol bir ýigit bilen.
It has been around for a long time.	Uzak wagt bäri bar.
Many people say that the first day is not bad.	Köp adam ilkinji gün erbet däl diýen ýaly.
In fact, it is a very good thing.	Aslynda bu gaty gowy zat.
It could be.	Ol bolup biler.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
Things were not good at home.	Öýde zatlar gowy däldi.
Of course, this will be bad.	Elbetde, bu erbet bolar.
Only one person.	Diňe bir adam.
I had no choice.	Mende başga ýol ýokdy.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda ol bir hili, ýöne alada ýok.
There will be no time.	Wagt bolmaz.
In fact, there is no one else.	Aslynda başga hiç kim ýok.
Everything that comes next.	Geljek hemme zat.
That's all there is to it.	Bar etmeli zady.
In fact before.	Aslynda öň.
We are not here to harm you.	Biz bu ýere zyýan bermek üçin däl.
That shouldn’t have bothered him.	Bu ony biynjalyk etmeli däldi.
It may have helped a little.	Biraz kömek eden bolmagy mümkin.
Smart but good.	Akylly, ýöne gowy.
Who we are for them.	Biz olar üçin kim.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
And now the time has come.	Indi bolsa wagt geldi.
You have to do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly etmeli.
This is a very difficult issue.	Bu gaty kyn mesele.
Tell me when it will be.	Haçan boljakdygyny aýdyň.
I just had to go with him.	Men diňe onuň bilen gitmeli boldum.
There will be a long way to go.	Uzak ýol bolar.
And then he had to say.	Soň bolsa aýtmaly boldy.
He was always there.	Ol elmydama bardy.
He wanted to try something else.	Başga bir zady synap görmek isledi.
You have to make one or two mistakes.	Bir ýa-da iki ýalňyşlyk almaly.
It was not necessary at all.	Bu düýbünden zerur däldi.
In the evening.	Agşam.
This guy is great.	Bu ýigit gaty gowy.
In fact, everything happened.	Aslynda hemme zat boldy.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
I'm sorry, really.	Bagyşlaň, hakykatdanam.
We can't allow that.	Biz muňa rugsat berip bilmeris.
When will the question be?	Sorag haçan bolar?
He knows he exists.	Özüniň bardygyny bilýär.
Tell me what to do.	Näme etmelidigimi aýdyň.
Right now	Şu wagt.
It will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek.
I want to go	Men gitmek isleýärin
You still have	Sen henizem bar.
No one called him.	Hiç kim oňa jaň etmedi.
Someone must have called.	Kimdir biri jaň eden bolmaly.
He didn't even pay attention.	Ol hatda üns bermedi.
I think he did.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol pikir etdi.
He said he had.	Ol özüniň bardygyny aýtdy.
I can't do it yet	Men entek edip bilemok
He asked a question.	Ol bir sorag berdi.
I think about it.	Men bu hakda pikir edýärin.
This is very likely to be the case.	Munuň şeýle bolmagy gaty ähtimal.
There is nothing new there.	Ol ýerde täze zat ýok.
He has.	Ol bar.
Maybe another year.	Belki, ýene bir ýyl.
He told me about it.	Bu hakda maňa aýtdy.
We can't	Biz edip bilmeris
Where did that money go? 	Şol pul nirä gitdi?
who knows	kim bilýär.
I have never seen anything like it.	Munuň ýaly zady hiç wagt görmedim.
I hope not.	Kän däl diýip umyt edýärin.
He knows nothing about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat bilmeýär.
Couldn't be much.	Kän bolup bilmedi.
Doing more damage to it.	Oňa has köp zyýan bermek.
What he did every month.	Her aý eden işi.
Mary was right.	Merýem dogry aýtdy.
Here's what he knows.	Ine, onuň bilýän zady.
It can be kind of hard.	Bu bir hili kyn bolup biler.
Smart, beautiful, smart.	Akylly, owadan, akylly.
He didn't tell me that.	Ol maňa beýle zat aýtmady.
Because it is.	Sebäbi bu.
This or that.	Bu ýa-da.
I never have.	Mende hiç wagt ýok.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Men muny siziň üçin islemedim.
He called you.	Ol saňa jaň etdi.
I thought it looked smart.	Bu meni akylly görünýär diýip pikir etdim.
I did it with him.	Men onuň bilen etdim.
There was a good reason to think so.	Şeýle pikir etmegiň gowy sebäbi bardy.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
It was hard.	Bu kyn boldy.
That's exactly what happened.	Bu edil şeýle boldy.
The answer is nothing.	Jogap hiç zat däl.
Because money.	Sebäbi pul.
And then.	Soň bolsa.
He will do it now.	Indi eder.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
He is the happiest here.	Ol bu ýerde iň bagtly.
It's faster here.	Bu ýerde has çalt.
In fact, he did nothing.	Aslynda hiç zat etmedi.
It's about everything.	Bu hemme zat hakda.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Uly bolmaly bolsa gerek.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
Now they were gone.	Indi olar hiç ýerde ýokdy.
Not just you.	Diňe sen däl.
Now it’s not bad for that.	Indi ol munuň üçin erbet däl.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
He wanted to.	Isledi.
He is not for himself.	Ol özi üçin däl.
If it is good, it is.	Gowy bolsa, bu.
Now it was the same.	Indi ol hem edil şonuň ýalydy.
What happened	Näme boldy?
There is no one to be there.	Ol ýerde bolmaly hiç kim ýok.
We don't need much.	Bize zerur zat kän däl.
There is a problem.	Bir kynçylyk bar.
It was as if he wasn't there.	Ol ýerde ýok ýalydy.
I want that.	Men muny isleýärin.
Of course it should be.	Elbetde bolmaly.
I knew better.	Men has gowy bilýärdim.
It was today.	Bu gün boldy.
Maybe one night.	Belki bir gije.
There is no time for that.	Munuň üçin wagty ýok.
No one wants to hurt you.	Hiç kim size zyýan bermek islemeýär.
He told me.	Ol maňa aýtdy.
Such a beautiful man.	Şeýle owadan adam.
I'll call him	Men oňa jaň etjek
It's very difficult for him.	Oňa gaty kyn.
Not now.	Häzir ýok.
It was not always the case.	Elmydama bir zat däldi.
This is a great way.	Bu ajaýyp ýol.
It should be good.	Gowy bolmaly.
Same thing.	Edil şol bir zat.
Not bad, but not fun.	Erbet däl, ýöne gyzykly däl.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
He is not.	Ol däl.
Maybe not for a year.	Belki bir ýyl däl.
You have to do it twice.	Iki gezek etmeli.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolmaz.
I think you can do that to me.	Muny maňa edip bilersiňiz öýdýän.
The most obvious answer.	Iň aýdyň jogap.
He wanted it and took it away.	Ol ony isledi, alyp gitdi.
This can take days, weeks.	Bu birnäçe gün, hepde alyp biler.
Not immediately.	Derrew däl.
I didn't even know it.	Hatda muny bilmeýärdim.
He got it.	Ol muny aldy.
It's always the same.	Elmydama şol bir zat.
No answer.	Jogap ýok.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
He said good.	Gowy diýdi.
This is a very good word.	Bu gaty gowy söz.
It never seems to be enough.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik däl ýaly.
Not a good day.	Gowy gün däl.
Also three.	Şeýle hem üç.
I think it looks great.	Meniň pikirimçe ajaýyp görünýär.
I did it once.	Bir gezek etdim.
There is no short answer.	Gysga jogap ýok.
It's too loud.	Bu gaty ses.
I don't know how that happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilemok.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He did it a lot.	Ol muny köp etdi.
Someone took it.	Kimdir biri alyp gitdi.
She looks beautiful and maybe she looks beautiful together.	Ol owadan görünýär we belki bilelikde owadan görünýär.
I want to.	Men isleýärin.
It can't be bothered.	Ony biynjalyk edip bolmaz.
It's about everything.	Bu hemme zat hakda.
He did a great job.	Ol gaty gowy iş etdi.
This is not a serious proposal.	Bu çynlakaý teklip däl.
He could not buy.	Ol satyn alyp bilmedi.
Maybe the two of them together.	Belki, ikisi bilelikde.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
I think it's beautiful.	Bu owadan diýip pikir edýärin.
This is not a lie.	Bu ýalan däl.
I was not stupid.	Men samsyk däldim.
Nor will it be the last.	Şeýle hem ol iň soňky bolmaz.
They should be too.	Olar hem bolmaly.
This is new.	Bu täze.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
This is not a good life for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy durmuş ýaly däl.
Like bad news.	Erbet habar ýaly.
I didn't do that.	Men muny etmedim.
Not money, of course.	Elbetde pul däl.
You don't have to be right.	Dogry bolmak hökman däl.
This time	Bu wagt.
It was too much.	Gaty köp boldy.
Forgive me.	Bagyşlaň meni .
Then something wonderful happened.	Soň ajaýyp bir zat boldy.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle bolýar.
It looks the same today.	Şu gün hem edil şonuň ýaly görünýär.
It's not big, but it's big enough.	Bu uly däl, ýöne ýeterlik uly.
In fact, everything is so right.	Aslynda hemme zat gaty dogry.
I could only think of one answer.	Diňe bir jogap hakda pikir edip bilýärdim.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu dogry söz.
In fact, it is possible.	Aslynda bu mümkin.
They are for everyone.	Olar hemmeler üçin.
Really bad.	Hakykatdanam gaty erbet.
In fact, he could not.	Aslynda ol hem edip bilmedi.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.
He made her crazy.	Ol ony däli etdi.
I need help.	Kömek isleýärin.
I always think of him.	Men ol hakda hemişe pikir edýärin.
That's the way it is.	Ine, şeýle bolar.
This is indeed the case.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle.
It will take two hours.	Iki sagat gerek bolar.
He made me happy.	Ol meni bagtly etdi.
I have someone.	Mende kimdir biri bar.
This is not a question.	Bu sorag däl.
This should not be too difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolmaly däl.
He thought he knew it was going to happen.	Munuň boljakdygyny bilýärdim diýip pikir etdi.
He knew he was going to do it.	Etjekdigini bilýärdi.
This can be difficult for him.	Bu onuň üçin kyn bolup biler.
Everyone will be better off.	Hemmeler has gowy bolar.
I've been there a lot.	Men ol ýerde köp boldum.
This is really smart.	Bu hakykatdanam akylly.
They are not alone.	Olar ýeke däl.
Of course.	Elbetde.
Here's what he did yesterday morning.	Ine, düýn irden eden zatlary.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
He wanted another way.	Başga ýol isledi.
Nothing great, but certainly not bad.	Ajaýyp zat ýok, ýöne elbetde erbet däl.
You can go.	Siz gidip bilersiňiz.
It was a good reason.	Gowy sebäp boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu akylly zat.
Both are good with me.	Ikisi-de meniň bilen gowy.
This is strange.	Bu geň.
Of course.	Elbetde.
You have to do it fast.	Ony çalt etmeli.
It was decided.	Karar boldy.
I have to go and call.	Men gidip jaň etmeli.
Everyone is doing this.	Her kim bu işi edýär.
It was good for me.	Bu meniň üçin gowy boldy.
Often they are.	Köplenç olar.
Not everything.	Hemme zat däl.
It would be interesting.	Gyzykly bolardy.
He never did anything interesting.	Ol hiç wagt gyzykly zat etmedi.
The problem is not new.	Mesele täze däl.
Not so now.	Häzir beýle däl.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
That's right.	Dogry.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
He came out with me.	Ol meniň bilen çykdy.
It took a while, of course.	Elbetde birnäçe wagt aldy.
He is a really good man.	Hakykatdanam gowy adam.
I couldn't do that	Men muny edip bilmedim
It's kind of.	Bu bir hili.
This decision is correct.	Bu karar dogry.
Of course it will be.	Elbetde şeýle bolar.
He was not at home.	Ol öýde däldi.
I hope it exists.	Ol bar diýip umyt edýärin.
It was nothing for him.	Bu onuň üçin hiç zat däldi.
It was good for him.	Bu onuň üçin gowy boldy.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmeli däl.
Maybe he will be happy.	Belki bagtly bolar.
It seems to have helped.	Bu kömek eden ýaly.
The idea came back to him.	Pikir oňa gaýdyp geldi.
It's easier to sing with someone.	Kimdir biri bilen aýdym aýtmak has aňsat.
There are as many as I have.	Ol ýerde meniň ýaly köp.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
Very well, he would have to go.	Gaty gowy, ol gitmeli bolardy.

I can't get it	Men ony alyp bilemok
No way.	Mümkinçilik ýok.

Not much tonight.	Bu gije kän däl.
He said it again, almost like a song.	Ol muny ýene bir gezek aýtdy, aýdym ýaly diýen ýaly aýtdy.
I want to talk to him.	Men onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
He is not like you.	Ol seniň ýaly däl.
There will be someone else.	Başga biri bolar.
There will be a lot of work.	Iş köp bolar.
He is a man.	Ol adam.
How to get it.	Nädip almaly.
Only true and false.	Diňe dogry we ýalan.
I thought about it.	Men ol hakda pikir etdim.
It's been a good year.	Gowy ýyl boldy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, ol beýle däldi.
Not a single issue like this is much.	Munuň ýaly ýekeje mesele kän zat däl.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
He was not like that at all.	Ol asla beýle däldi.
I must know that.	Men muny bilýän bolmaly.
It doesn't take much.	Kän gerek bolmaz.
I saw it.	Ony gördüm.
I paid a lot of attention to that.	Men muňa köp üns berdim.
She is really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy.
Will be back to get more.	Has köp zat almak üçin gaýdyp geler.
I'm worse off.	Men has erbet.
This has always been the case.	Hemişe şeýle boldy.
He didn't need anything.	Oňa hiç zat gerek däldi.
I can admit that too.	Muny hem boýun alyp bilerin.
That is what happened.	Şeýle zatlar boldy.
No one knew better than that.	Hiç kim mundan gowy bilmeýärdi.
He said a word.	Ol bir söz aýtdy.
No one could sing.	Hiç kim aýdym aýdyp bilmedi.
We may need it.	Bize gerek bolup biler.
In fact you are the worst	Aslynda sen iň erbet
Not good.	Gowy däl.
I knew it right away.	Men muny derrew bilýärdim.
For the right reason.	Dogry sebäp bilen.
It could be like next month.	Geljek aý ýaly bolup biler.
It didn't work out.	Bu hiç zat etmedi.
In fact the same person.	Aslynda şol bir adam.
You are a good girl	Sen gowy gyz
I was not so happy.	Men beýle bagtly däldim.
It's the same.	Edil şol bir.
I have one after me.	Menden soň biri bar.
One does not think it is possible, but it is.	Biri mümkin diýip pikir etmeýär, ýöne şeýle boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şonuň ýaly bolmaly.
He is a good, beautiful man.	Ol gowy, owadan adam.
A challenge today.	Bu gün bir kynçylyk.
It's not always easy to do that.	Muny etmek elmydama aňsat däl.
Not a big deal.	Uly mesele däl.
There is an answer.	Jogap bar.
That's what happened.	Şeýle boldy.
She looks so beautiful.	Ol gaty owadan adam ýaly bolup görünýär.
Nothing new, not even.	Täze zat ýok, hatda.

In fact, everything is here.	Aslynda hemme zat şu ýerde.
Next time.	Indiki gezek.
When did this happen.	Bu haçan boldy.
He no longer needed it.	Oňa indi gerek däldi.
I could do nothing	Men hiç zat edip bilmedim
There was something else.	Başga bir zat bardy.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu dogry däl.
I found it very disturbing.	Men muny gaty biynjalyk gördüm.
I will make her happy.	Men ony bagtly ederin.
I will oppose it.	Men oňa garşy bolaryn.
I don't think so.	Men bir däl öýdemok.
I should never have done that before.	Muny öň hiç wagt etmeli däldim.
This is not the case.	Bu däl.
No one likes it.	Hiç kim ony halamaýar.
This is not very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn däl.
I'm somewhere else.	Men başga bir ýerde.
He was kind of surprised.	Ol bir hili geň galdy.
Another day, maybe, but not today.	Başga bir gün, belki, ýöne bu gün däl.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
Everyone except me.	Menden başga hemmeler.
Full and complete word.	Doly we doly söz.
There was nothing against it.	Oňa garşy hiç zat ýokdy.
He is now.	Ol häzir.
No need.	Gerek däl.
And then he was there.	Soň bolsa ol ýerde boldy.
I've only been to him twice.	Men onuň bilen diňe iki gezek boldum.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I care more.	Men has köp alada edýärin.
He can only be a very bad person.	Ol diňe gaty erbet adam bolup biler.
I'm sure he knows how to do that.	Muny nädip etmelidigini biljekdigine ynanýaryn.
It may be shorter.	Has gysga bolmagy mümkin.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat gowy.
.	.
This is really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty kyn.
I haven't been able to tell before.	Men ozal aýdyp bilmedim.
You always really need one day.	Elmydama bir gün hakykatdanam size gerek.
I want to go too far now.	Indi gaty köp gitmek isleýärin.
This is not very true.	Bu gaty dogry däl.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
It would be nice if he could see something else.	Başga bir zat gören bolsa gowy bolardy.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
Someone is helping me, which is not true.	Kimdir biri maňa kömek edýär, bu beýle dogry däl.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
Okay, not always serious.	Bolýar, hemişe çynlakaý däl.
I gave you an answer.	Men size bir jogap berdim.
He is telling the truth.	Ol hakykaty aýdýar.
I just want to be close to you.	Men diňe size ýakyn bolmak isleýärin.
It will not always be in the right place.	Elmydama dogry ýerde bolmaz.

Now tell me.	Indi maňa aýdyň.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I really don't like it	Men hakykatdanam halamok
I was so crazy.	Men gaty däli boldum.

Not a big deal, no.	Uly mesele däl, ýok.
There is nothing there.	Ol ýerde hiç zat ýok.
I think it could be.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol hem bolup biler.
He couldn't tell her everything.	Oňa hemme zady aýdyp bilmedi.
They are the police.	Olar polisiýa.
I couldn't help it.	Men oňa kömek edip bilmedim.
I didn't know anything.	Men hiç zady bilmeýärdim.
This can be fun.	Bu gyzykly bolup biler.
This is not a bad thing.	Bu erbet zat däl.
He did not say anything else.	Bu hakda başga hiç zat aýtmady.
I was happy.	Men bagtly boldum.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
Of course, this is the case here.	Elbetde, bu ýerde şeýle.
That's a lot of questions.	Bu gaty köp sorag.
Everything is really easy.	Hemme zat hakykatdanam aňsat.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu beýle däl ýaly.
That could be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolup biler.
Of course not.	Elbetde, bolmaz.
Not the best job, he had to admit.	Iň gowy işi däl, boýun almaly boldy.
I think that makes us smart.	Bu bizi akylly edýär diýip pikir edýärin.
I gave.	Men berdim.
Of course it was.	Elbetde şeýle boldy.
He thinks about it every night.	Ol bu hakda her gije pikir edýär.
Of course, tomorrow.	Elbetde, ertir.
In a new place.	Täze ýerde.
There and there.	Ol ýerde we ol ýerde.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
It's hard to see.	Muny görmek gaty kyn.
This is not the case at all.	Bu düýbünden beýle däl.
There are probably two issues.	Mümkin iki mesele bar.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
You are not good	Sen gowy däl
This is certainly not the case.	Bu, elbetde, dogry däl.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
It always looks that way.	Elmydama şeýle görünýär.
It's almost evening.	Agşam diýen ýaly.
It's over.	Soň boldy.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
This or that sound.	Bu ýa-da ses.
The meal is like this.	Nahar şeýle.
I had to help.	Men kömek etmeli boldum.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
Probably not.	Belki, beýle bolmaz.
This is completely new.	Bu düýbünden täze.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
And the police.	Polisiýa hem.
Can you recommend me?	Maňa maslahat berip bilersiňizmi?
We can recommend this.	Muny maslahat berip bileris.
In fact, it is different.	Aslynda ol başga zat.
He asked me for help.	Ol maňa kömek sorady.
I didn't do anything wrong.	Erbet zat etmedim.
It's not all about you.	Hemme zat sen hakda däl.
That's more.	Bu has köp.
Not anymore.	Indi däl.
The last day was wonderful.	Soňky gün ajaýyp boldy.
Likewise, no one had to go here.	Edil şonuň ýaly, bu ýerde hiç kim gitmeli däldi.
There is one.	Biri bar.
I agree with that.	Men muňa razy.
He was never here either.	Ol hem hiç wagt bu ýerde däldi.
Everything is a bit here.	Bu ýerde hemme zat birneme bar.
No one has done that before.	Mundan öň hiç kim muny etmedi.
He can do it now, he can do it here.	Ol indi edip biler, şu ýerde edip biler.
It took a few months.	Birnäçe aý aldy.
So it almost always happens.	Şonuň üçin elmydama diýen ýaly bolýar.
He is arresting you.	Ol sizi tussag edýär.
For whom	Kim üçin?
Maybe he's there.	Belki, ol şol ýerde.
I can only do things so fast.	Men diňe zatlary gaty çalt edip bilerin.
You know what that does to you.	Munuň saňa näme edýändigini bilýärsiň.
I had no money.	Mende pul ýokdy.
Not good at all.	Asla gowy däl.
I'm right.	Dogry ynanýaryn.
Maybe not so badly.	Belki beýle erbet bolmaz.
The good thing is not really.	Gowy zat aslynda beýle däl.
He was nowhere.	Ol hiç ýerde däldi.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
He came back to us.	Ol bize gaýdyp geldi.
Because life is hard.	Sebäbi durmuş kyn.
I can't do that	Men muny edip bilemok
He knew.	Ol bilýärdi.
Always together, but always alone.	Elmydama bilelikde, ýöne hemişe ýeke.
He will be here right now.	Ol şu wagt şu ýerde bolar.
Probably.	Mümkin.
This is advice.	Bu maslahat.
Here's what you need to do.	Ine, sen etjek zadyň.
It will only be a worry.	Bu diňe biynjalyk bolar.
Of course, this is easy.	Elbetde, bu aňsat.
It could be a shorter time.	Has gysga wagt bolup biler.
I didn’t know about it until last week.	Bu barada geçen hepde çenli bilmedim.
That man remained.	Ol adam galdy.
Almost as good as new.	Täze ýaly diýen ýaly gowy.
For the day	Gün üçin
Several voices sang together.	Birnäçe ses bilelikde aýdym aýtdy.
The money is there.	Pul şol ýerde.
This is a great job.	Bu ajaýyp iş.
I knew it would be there.	Ol ýerde boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
Almost unnecessary.	Gerek däl diýen ýaly.
Next loan.	Indiki karz.
That's right.	Dogry.
He wants more.	Has köp zady isleýär.
It's me or you.	Bu men ýa-da sen.
Of course there is, but not for you.	Elbetde bar, ýöne siziň üçin däl.
It just turned out great.	Edil şonuň ýaly ajaýyp çykdy.
Seeing his work.	Onuň işi görmek.
He never thinks of anything.	Ol asla hiç zat hakda pikir etmeýär.
It was like another time.	Başga wagt ýalydy.
I think you should be that girl.	Meniň pikirimçe sen şol gyz bolmaly.
I got a few answers this week.	Şu hepde birnäçe jogap aldym.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
Do something crazy.	Bir däli et.
You are so beautiful.	Siz gaty owadan.
This was not an interesting time.	Bu gyzykly wagt däldi.
He was not ready to go anywhere.	Ol hiç ýere gitmäge taýyn däldi.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Of course.	Elbetde.
You can do well there.	Şol ýerde gowy edip bilersiňiz.
Best guy	Iň gowy ýigit.
No one else could.	Başga hiç kim edip bilmedi.
Okay.	Bolýar.
It was almost at home.	Öýde diýen ýalydy.
it will not be possible to get	almak mümkin bolmaz.
Tell me if you need help.	Kömek gerek bolsa, aýdyň.
I'm fine with it.	Men onuň bilen gowy.
This will not happen.	Bu bolmaz.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
Correct answer.	Dogry jogap.
It's more interesting.	Ol has gyzykly.
I have to be good.	Men gowy bolmaly.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
This is great too.	Bu hem ajaýyp.
We are very difficult.	Biz gaty kyn.
I heard for an hour.	Bir sagat eşitdim.
He could leave at any time.	Islän wagty gidip bilýärdi.
Good things are not easy.	Gowy zat aňsat däl.
Not a job.	Iş däl.
Nothing bothers him.	Hiç zat ony biynjalyk etmeýär.
He had no time for himself.	Özüne wagt ýokdy.
What happened	Näme boldy?
He was nowhere.	Ol hiç ýerde däldi.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
I was alone.	Men ýeke boldum.
I knew that.	Muny gowy bilýärdim.
That would be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolardy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle etmedi.
Of course, that seemed right to him.	Elbetde, bu onuň üçin dogry ýalydy.
He is coming now.	Ol indi gelýär.
Things are not good right now.	Häzirki wagtda zatlar gowy däl.
This guy doesn't have to.	Bu ýigit hökman däl.
There is so much good here.	Bu ýerde köp gowy zat bar.
Okay.	Bolýar.
He could never do it right.	Hiç haçan dogry edip bilmedi.
Not bad at all, very good.	Asla erbet däl, gaty gowy.
This is not the case at all.	Bu düýbünden bir zat däl.
And then a man.	Soň bolsa bir adam.
What a good thing.	Nähili gowy zat.
Who are you	Sen kim
He was not like that.	Ol ýaly däldi.
I believe it will be good.	Gowy boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
There is not even a single answer.	Hatda ýekeje jogap hem ýok.
I can even decide.	Men hatda karar berip bilerin.
I think this is probably a problem.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu belki bir mesele.
Really great.	Hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
Someone took it.	Kimdir biri ony alyp gitdi.
That's a lot.	Gaty bir zat.
I got it.	Men aldym.
You have to tell me about it.	Bu hakda maňa aýtmaly.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hili iş.
He did not arrest.	Ol tussag etmedi.
It could be great.	Gaty gowy bolup biler.
No one knows what happened next.	Soň näme bolandygyny hiç kim bilenok.
Not too much.	Gaty kän däl.
He can buy.	Ol satyn alyp biler.
This is a problem.	Bu bir mesele.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
I have been here all day.	Men bu ýerde bütin gün boldum.
I actually loved it.	Aslynda gaty gowy gördüm.
It's just me, me, me.	Bu diňe men, men, men däl.
Because there will be one.	Sebäbi biri bolar.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
In fact, you are not.	Aslynda sen beýle däl.
I'm the other way around.	Men başga ýol.
Like two weeks.	Iki hepde ýaly.
Asking this question is not for me.	Bu sorag bermek meniň üçin däl.
No one.	Hiç kim.
I didn't need it anymore.	Maňa indi gerek däldi.
Just a job.	Diňe bir iş.
I called and I called.	Men jaň etdim we jaň etdim.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
That person is missing.	Ol adam ýok.
It may or may not happen.	Bolup biler, bolmaz.
This is stupid, but difficult.	Bu samsyk, ýöne kyn.
So the problem for him is different.	Şonuň üçin onuň üçin mesele başga.
I have to	Mende bolmaly
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
Isn't it wonderful?	Ajaýyp dälmi?
There was a loud noise.	Gaty ses bardy.
I think he wants to talk to me alone.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol meniň bilen ýeke gürleşmek isleýär.
He didn't have to tell anyone.	Ol hiç kime aýtmaly däldi.
It seemed good.	Gowy ýalydy.
I want to think.	Men pikir etmek isleýärin.
I was smart to him.	Men oňa akylly boldum.
I am against it.	Men muňa garşy.
If you have to.	Etmeli bolsa.
Don't go for less that your full potential.	Köp gitmeli däl.
There may be a mistake.	Mümkin ýalňyşlyk bar.
He had nothing to say.	Mundan başga hiç zat aýtmaly däldi.
This is not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däl.
I need them.	Olar maňa gerek.
He doesn't need you.	Ol saňa mätäç däl.
Of course, this is not true.	Elbetde, bu düýbünden dogry däl.
Only you are there.	Diňe sen bar.
I'm new there.	Men ol ýerde täze.
He understood.	Ol düşündi.
And then summer.	Soň bolsa tomus.
He has.	Ol bar.
I was serious.	Men çynlakaý boldum.
Just enough and not much.	Diňe ýeterlik we birneme köp däl.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Okay.	Bolýar.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
It was very difficult for him.	Bu onuň üçin gaty kyn boldy.
It won't be long now.	Indi kän bolmaz.
Very close to us	Bize gaty ýakyn.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Only about himself.	Diňe özi hakda.
It helped.	Bu kömek etdi.
He didn't care.	Ol alada etmedi.
When did it happen	Haçan boldy.
No questions asked.	Sorag ýok.
He really did.	Ol hakykatdanam etdi.
I can't do it with anyone else.	Başga biri bilen edip bilemok.
He is not alone.	Ol ýeke däl.
I can't say.	Men aýdyp biljek däl.
This is the fastest way.	Bu iň çalt ýol.
Here was someone who could help him.	Ine, oňa kömek edip biljek biri bardy.
It bothered me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etdi.
You have to do this every day.	Muny her gün etmeli.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
This should not be too difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolmaly däl.
Borrowing time	Wagt karz almak
I think they are great.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar gaty gowy.
He wants to rest.	Ol dynç almak isleýär.
There is something strange here.	Bu ýerde geň bir zat bar.
It won't happen to me anymore.	Menden soň mundan beýläk bolmaz.
In fact, no one knows.	Aslynda hiç kim bilenok.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
He is trying to do the right thing with me.	Ol meniň bilen dogry etjek bolýar.
He knows better now.	Häzirki wagtda ol has gowy bilýär.
This is about us.	Bu biz hakda.
He was not alone in the house.	Bu öýde ýeke däldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şeýle zat.
I have to give you everything.	Men saňa hemme zady bermeli.
Of course, this was great for me.	Elbetde, bu meniň üçin ajaýyp boldy.
Nothing.	Hiç zat ýok.
I was with him all day.	Men bütin gün onuň bilen.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat däldi.
I didn't have to say a word.	Men bir söz aýtmaly däldim.
This is a very good reason.	Bu gaty gowy sebäp.
It just didn't happen.	Diňe beýle zat ýokdy.
She is really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy.
Right here.	Edil şu ýerde.
He comes here every year.	Ol bu ýere her ýyl gaýdyp gelýär.
Good.	Gowy.
I was crazy about him.	Men ol hakda däli boldum.
This is not very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn däl.
It was not the same as before.	Öňem edil häzirki ýaly däldi.
It will always be right with me.	Elmydama meniň bilen dogry bolar.
If it's tonight.	Bu agşam bolsa.
I can only do so much.	Men diňe köp zady edip bilerin.
It's only been two years.	Bu diňe iki ýyl.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
He did the impossible.	Ol mümkin däl zady etdi.
What happened.	Näme boldy.
Not surprisingly.	Geň däl.
Both questions are difficult.	Iki sorag hem kyn.
He has to go.	Ol gitmeli.
I didn't do that at the time.	Men şol wagt etmedim.
We can never be completely happy.	Biz hiç wagt doly bagtly bolup bilmeris.
It's not that difficult.	Bu beýle kyn däl.
This is really bad.	Bu hakykatdanam erbet.
Okay, we even.	Bolýar, biz hatda.
In fact, I did not object.	Aslynda muňa garşy däldim.
It could be great.	Gaty gowy bolup biler.
It's great to be with her.	Onuň bilen bolmak gaty hezil.
I know, I'm not very smart.	Bilýärin, gaty akylly däl.
Now this way, now, now.	Indi bu ýol, indi, indi.
They were always there.	Olar elmydama bardy.
Must be at home.	Öýde bolmaly.
There are actually two people.	Aslynda iki adam.
I need it, so nothing.	Maňa gerek, şonuň üçin hiç zat ýok.
Who is he, man.	Ol kim, adam.
There seems to be nothing else to do.	Başga edip biljek zady ýok ýaly.
There are two things to worry about.	Alada etmeli iki zat bar.
It would be almost impossible to do that.	Muny etmek mümkin däl diýen ýaly bolardy.
Many people were amazed at this.	Köp adam muňa haýran galdy.
No one paid attention to us.	Hiç kim bize üns bermedi.
Good idea.	Gowy pikir.
Often there is no answer.	Köplenç jogap ýok.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Saňa hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
We are just us.	Biz diňe biz.
Always the way.	Elmydama ýol.
In fact, this is good news.	Aslynda bu gowy habar.
There was no time.	Hiç wagt ýokdy.
It was not a problem.	Mesele däldi.
Tell me something.	Size bir zat aýdyň.
So many wonderful things can be done.	Şonuň üçin köp ajaýyp zatlar edip bolýar.
It seems very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly ýaly.
I'm not difficult.	Men kyn däl.
This will not be the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek bolmaz.
This seems to be the right reason.	Munuň dogry sebäbi ýaly bolup görünýär.
It doesn't do anything to help her.	Bu oňa kömek etmek üçin düýbünden hiç zat etmeýär.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
At the same time every day.	Her gün şol bir wagt.
I can only be myself.	Men diňe özüm bolup bilerin.
Whatever you need.	Näme gerek bolsa.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
I am more beautiful.	Men has ajaýyp.
It can be either.	Bu ýa-da ikisi hem bolup biler.
And then there is the strange thing.	Soň bolsa başga bir geň zat bar.
The last time he seemed to want to help.	Soňky gezek kömek etmek isleýän ýalydy.
I just don't know enough.	Diňe ýeterlik bilemok.
There was no police.	Polisiýa ýokdy.
This is a big mistake.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk.
He did not say.	Ol aýtmady.
Something went wrong.	Bir zat gaty erbet boldy.
As before.	Öňküsi ýaly.
He didn't know it.	Ol muny bilmeýärdi.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
Awesome awesome.	Ajaýyp ajaýyp.
You are different.	Siz başga.
I had never thought of that before.	Bu hakda öňem pikir etmedim.
Maybe you should.	Belki etmeli.
I gave a lot at that time.	Men şol wagt köp zat berdim.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
In fact, he was not a prisoner.	Aslynda ol tussag däldi.
Nothing is or is not.	Hiç zat bir zat däl ýa-da asla ýok.
I'm actually afraid of you.	Aslynda senden gorkýaryn.
Someone is calling this police.	Kimdir biri bu polisiýa jaň edýär.
No one thought about it.	Hiç kim bu barada pikir etmedi.
I did not know.	Men bilmedim.
It could be a good thing.	Gowy zat bolup biler.
No work.	Iş ýok.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty owadan.
I'm not crazy about that.	Men muňa däli däldim.
No one can do that.	Hiç kim muny edip bilmez.
Just to know that it is not.	Diňe däldigini bilmek üçin.
Money was always there.	Pul elmydama bardy.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
A few days left	Birnäçe gün galdy
Something else happened.	Başga bir zat boldy.
This can be very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn bolup biler.
He is right there.	Ol edil şol ýerde.
Maybe there is no police.	Belki, polisiýa ýok.
The chances are great.	Mümkinçilik uly.
I can answer that.	Munuň üçin jogap berip bilerin.
Something about that bothered him.	Bu hakda bir zat ony biynjalyk etdi.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
We are here.	Biz şu ýerde.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman beýle bolmaz.
It will be so.	Ol şeýle bolar.
He had to get permission.	Ol rugsat almaly boldy.
This did not allow me.	Bu maňa rugsat bermedi.
We will need it.	Bize gerek bolar.
he thought.	diýip pikir etdi.
Okay, here it is.	Bolýar, ine şu.
Police arrived.	Polisiýa geldi.
He was not there yet.	Ol entek ýokdy.
They are never fun.	Olar hiç wagt gyzykly däl.
He didn't have to be here.	Ol bu ýerde bolmaly däldi.
Of course it was.	Elbetde şeýle boldy.
I had enough, but it wasn’t very good.	Men ýeterlik boldum, ýöne gaty gowy däldi.
It bothered me to think about it.	Bu hakda pikir etmek meni biynjalyk etdi.
He was right.	Ol özüni dogry aýtdy.
It should be easy today.	Bu gün aňsat bolmaly.
I can see now.	Men indi görüp bilýärin.
It just makes him human.	Diňe ony adam edýär.
In fact, I'm just like you.	Aslynda men seniň ýaly.
Serious mistake.	Çynlakaý ýalňyşlyk.
He didn't want to think about it either.	Ol hem bu hakda pikir etmek islemedi.
He really likes you.	Ol seni hakykatdanam halaýar.
He went to work.	Ol işe gitdi.
Too many now.	Häzir gaty köp.
Money is another matter.	Pul başga mesele.
He did it.	Ol muny etdi.
He made no mistake.	Ol hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedi.
Very crazy.	Gaty däli.
This can take a long time.	Bu köp wagt alyp biler.
He didn't say a word until he got home.	Öýüne çenli iki söz aýtmady.
That seemed right.	Bu dogry ýalydy.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Munuň ýaly bolmaly däl.
Not this week.	Bu hepde däl.
Someone to destroy it.	Kimdir biri ony ýok etmek üçin.
I was the first to admit it.	Men muny ilkinji bolup boýun aldym.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu mesele şu ýerde.
I am a man	Men bir adam
I want a girl	Men bir gyz isleýärin
The police are there.	Polisiýa ol ýerde.
I just told the truth.	Men diňe hakykaty aýtdym.
I want it now	Men indi isleýärin
This always worries me.	Bu meni hemişe biynjalyk edýär.
I knew him very well.	Men ony gaty gowy bilýärdim.
I told you.	Men saňa aýtdym.
Only one night and one night.	Diňe bir gije we bir gije.
He has.	Ol bar.
There is a long way to go.	Uzak ýol bar.
Maybe maybe.	Belki belki mümkin.
I am happy right now.	Men şu wagt bagtly.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
Beautiful, beautiful! 	Owadan, owadan!
We are there.	Biz şol ýerde.
I'm scared and for good reason.	Men gorkýaryn we gowy sebäp bilen.
Okay, not so.	Bolýar, beýle däl.
He is stupid!	Ol samsyk!
Nothing will happen to me.	Maňa hiç zat bolmaz.
Nothing at all, maybe.	Asla hiç zat ýok, belki.
There is no other reason.	Başga sebäp ýok.
It can't help it at all.	Bu oňa asla kömek edip bilmez.
No one is alone.	Hiç kim ýeke däl.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
There was a lot to do.	Etmeli köp zat bardy.
I heard that.	Men muny eşitdim.
Because it is so beautiful.	Sebäbi gaty owadan.
For me, for him, for us.	Meniň üçin, onuň üçin, biziň üçin.
That can't be good.	Bu gowy bolup bilmez.
They need you here.	Olar size şu ýerde gerek.
The time was short.	Wagt gysga boldy.
This can help.	Bu kömek edip biler.
A stupid decision.	Bir samsyk karar.
It can be done now because it can be done.	Indi edip bolýar, sebäbi edip bolýar.
It happened to me this week.	Bu hepde maňa boldy.
In fact.	Aslynda.
And then he could tell her everything.	Soň bolsa oňa hemme zady aýdyp bilýärdi.
Seriously, nothing like that.	Çynlakaý, hiç zat ýaly däl.
I want to be with you.	Men siziň bilen bolmak isleýärin.
They are great and not bad at all.	Olar ajaýyp, asla erbet däl.
I can still.	Men henizem mümkin.
More work for you, sorry.	Size has köp iş, bagyşlaň.
Here it is now.	Ine, indi ýok.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
He didn't care about anything else.	Ol başga bir zat hakda alada etmedi.
Everyone is really good.	Her kim hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
I am older than you	Men senden uly
Voted.	Ses berdi.
Good to see you too	Seni hem görmek gowy zat.
I don't want any problems.	Men hiç hili kynçylyk islämok.
I'm not here.	Men bu ýerde däl.
That's all there is to it.	Bu hakykatdanam bar zat.
He knows how to do it.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilýär.
You are a bad person	Sen erbet adam
I have to tell you.	Men saňa aýtmaly.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I still don't know	Men henizem bilemok
It seems like a long time ago.	Köp wagt geçen ýaly.
It's kind of.	Bu bir hili.
Too weird for me.	Meniň üçin gaty geň.
What, not who.	Näme, kim däl.
I thought it might be.	Bolup biler diýip pikir etdim.
Because he didn't have time like that.	Sebäbi, onuň ýaly wagty ýokdy.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
Not at all.	Asla däl.
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şonuň ýaly boldy.
He couldn't do it anymore.	Ol indi edip bilmedi.
It's been a long month and a long year.	Uzak aý we uzak ýyl boldy.
I think that's interesting.	Bu gyzykly diýip pikir edýärin.
This is not the case yet.	Bu entek beýle däl.
It actually seemed very good there.	Aslynda ol ýerde gaty gowy ýalydy.
I have to go	Men gitmeli
Here's a tip.	Ine bir maslahat.
You are a great boy	Sen ajaýyp ýigit.
I did a very bad job.	Men gaty erbet iş etdim.
He could see me.	Ol meni görüp bilýärdi.
I can't speak anymore	Indi gürläp bilemok
The most beautiful thing.	Iň owadan zat.
In fact, it already exists.	Aslynda ol eýýäm bar.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
Why not?	Näme üçin beýle etmeli däl?
This is great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp.
Of course.	Elbetde.
That should be great.	Bu gaty uly bolmaly.
You are not interesting.	Sen gyzykly däl.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
No one did.	Hiç kim etmedi.
Telling him everything.	Oňa hemme zady aýtmak.
It's been a week.	Bir hepde boldy.
They are also kind of beautiful.	Olar hem bir hili owadan.
He told himself for only a week.	Diňe bir hepde bäri özüne aýtdy.
I didn't know that	Bu hakda bilmedim
Needless to say.	Muny aýtmaly däl.
Now he has more to come.	Indi oňa has köp zat gelýär.
It was another day.	Bu başga bir gün boldy.
No answer.	Jogap däl.
I thought how right.	Men nähili dogry diýip pikir etdim.
We need money.	Bize pul gerek.
This statement is incorrect.	Bu söz dogry däl.
He is smarter than I am now.	Ol häzir menden has akylly.
It’s about doing something else.	Bu başga bir zat etmek hakda.
He could not see anything beautiful about her.	Ol hakda owadan bir zady görüp bilmedi.
They were not the only idea.	Olar diňe bir pikir däldi.
He had a job to do right now.	Edil şu wagt etmeli işi bardy.
Almost everyone came.	Hemmeler diýen ýaly geldi.
It shouldn't have been strange.	Geň zat bolmaly däldi.
This has been the biggest year yet.	Bu entek iň uly ýyl boldy.
No one had to go.	Hiç kim gitmeli däldi.
I was a little busy	Biraz meşgul boldum
This will not be a lie at all.	Bu düýbünden ýalan bolmaz.
He didn't want to do anything.	Ol hiç zat etmek islemedi.
This is a song.	Bu aýdym.
It can't be so beautiful.	Gaty owadan bolup bilmez.
There is nothing that anyone can say.	Hiç kimiň aýdyp biljek zady ýok.
It doesn't have to be that way, but it is.	Beýle bolmaly däl, ýöne şeýle.
He didn't want anything else.	Mundan başga hiç zat islemedi.
A day later.	Bir gün soň.
This is bad.	Bu erbet.
Everything came back to me.	Hemme zat maňa gaýdyp geldi.
Even kind of beautiful.	Hatda bir hili owadan.
Everything is fine now.	Häzir hemme zat gowy.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
Everyone has something to do.	Her kimiň etmeli zady bolmaly.
That would make me crazy too.	Bu hem meni däli eder.
Too much indeed.	Hakykatdanam gaty köp.
Do too much.	Gaty köp et.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
I'm not ready at all.	Men düýbünden taýyn däl.
This is not really a problem.	Bu hakykatdanam mesele däl.
Two hours on the ground.	Iki sagat ýerde.
I promised you.	Men saňa söz berdim.
It was a worry.	Bu biynjalyk boldy.
I had to do that.	Muny etmeli boldum.
I didn’t really think it was possible.	Aslynda mümkin diýip pikir etmedim.
It could be worse.	Has erbet bolmagy mümkin.
This is great for you.	Bu siziň üçin gaty gowy.
You are there.	Sen şol ýerde.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
Who really is	Hakykatdanam kim
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Money can be a concern right now.	Pul häzirki wagtda alada bolup biler.
This is not the case at all.	Bu asla beýle däl.
I'm fast, but not as fast as he used to be.	Men çalt, ýöne onuň ýaly çalt däl.
I have never seen this before.	Men ozal muny görmedim.
This is not one thing or another.	Bu bir zat ýa-da başga zat däl.
I want to say a lot.	Köp zat aýtmak isleýärin.
I didn’t think it was possible.	Mümkin diýip pikir etmedim.
I don't believe that.	Men muňa ynanamok.
He is everything to me.	Ol meniň hemme zadym.
It will take a lot of time for that.	Munuň üçin onuň köp wagty bolar.
In fact, there is no problem.	Aslynda mesele ýok.
Something was wrong at the time.	Şol wagt bir zat dogry däldi.
This is only once.	Bu diňe bir gezek.
No one is like that.	Hiç kim beýle däl.
This is for me.	Bu meniň üçin.
She was amazed.	Ol haýran galdy.
This was not the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek däldi.
These things are not for money.	Bu zatlar pul üçin däl.
Something else.	Başga bir zat.
This is a wonderful thing.	Bu ajaýyp bir zat.
Good.	Gowy.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
Why is there no life there.	Näme üçin ol ýerde durmuş ýok.
Everything.	Hemme zat.
Of course, this was not his first job.	Elbetde, bu onuň ilkinji işi däldi.
I wonder how crazy it would be.	Munuň nähili däli boljakdygyna haýran.
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa rugsat bermedi.
Absolutely wonderful for that.	Munuň üçin düýbünden ajaýyp.
I think that is absolutely true.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu düýbünden dogry.
I knew he could do it.	Edip biljekdigini bilýärdim.
It's not really that bad.	Ol hakykatdanam erbet däl.
It's hard to do that.	Muny etmek kyn.
I have to say that.	Muny aýtmaly.
I think that's a good thing.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy zat.
I won't be all day.	Men bütin gün bolmaz.
It is a good thing to be.	Bolmak gowy mesele.
Because it is not.	Sebäbi beýle däl.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
He never did.	Ol hiç haçan etmedi.
No one really wants to know.	Hiç kim hakykatdanam bilmek islemeýär.
He will care.	Ol alada eder.
You and I and everyone.	Sen we men we hemmeler.
This was never possible.	Bu hiç haçan mümkin däldi.
Can you be	Bolup bilersiňizmi?
There was something to be done.	Etmeli bir zady bardy.
There has to be a serious issue.	Çynlakaý bir mesele bolmaly.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Something else came to her.	Oňa başga bir zat geldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, hemişe onuň özi.
Of course, at the time, they seemed to be very big.	Elbetde, şol wagt olar gaty uly zat ýalydy.
Very close, but no, good.	Gaty ýakyn, ýöne ýok, gowy.
Everyone should buy.	Her kim satyn almaly.
He could sleep tomorrow.	Ertir uklap bilýärdi.
No question is too hard or too stupid.	Hiç hili sorag gaty kyn ýa-da gaty samsyk.
I'm sure he can advise you.	Size maslahat berip biljekdigine ynanýaryn.
The answer was almost always no.	Jogap hemişe diýen ýaly ýokdy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şeýle zat.
In fact, it doesn't take long.	Aslynda kän wagt almaly däl.
I need someone, that's what you want.	Maňa kimdir biri gerek, bu seniň isleýän.
He did not object.	Muňa garşy däldi.
Summer is busy everywhere.	Tomus hemme ýerde meşgul.
That could be a good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat bolup biler.
It also does a great job.	Bu hem gaty gowy iş edýär.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň, ine şeýle.
She is a girl.	Ol gyz.
They are together again.	Olar ýene bilelikde.
He is a smart, smart guy.	Ol akylly, akylly ýigit.
This is very difficult and probably very long.	Bu gaty kyn we belki gaty uzak.
This will never happen.	Bu hiç haçan bolmaz.
Now not everyone agrees and that's fine.	Indi hemmeler muňa razy däl we bu gowy.
That's how it came to be.	Ine, şeýle geldi.
It was not easy.	Bu aňsat däldi.
I'm not with you	Men seniň bilen däl
I advised.	Men maslahat berdim.
I was	Men boldum.
Not too bad yet, but it will be.	Entek gaty erbet däldi, ýöne bolar.
This is how it looks.	Ine, şeýle görünýär.
Too short for someone else.	Başga biri üçin gaty gysga.
We are very good at this.	Biz muňa gaty gowy.
For stupid reason.	Samsyk sebäp bilen.
There is always time.	Elmydama wagt bar.
I hope he can go one day.	Bir gün gidip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
I have two.	Mende iki gezek bar.
It was hard.	Bu kyn boldy.
This book too.	Bu kitap hem.
Okay, you can get it there.	Bolýar, şol ýerde alyp bilersiňiz.
It looks great at the time.	Şol wagt gaty gowy görünýär.
It will be wonderful.	Ajaýyp bir zat bolar.
This will not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaz.
No need to worry.	Alada etmegiň sebäbi ýok.
Here you can see and try for yourself.	Bu ýerde özüňiz görüp we synap bilersiňiz.
Of course there is something.	Elbetde bir zat bar.
He wanted to admit it.	Ol muny boýun almak isledi.
I did.	Men etdim.
I don't know about that.	Men bu zat hakda bilemok.
It's morning and night.	Bu ertir we gije.
I can see it all.	Men hemmesini görüp bilýärin.
He knows this well.	Ol muny gowy bilýär.
Okay, that's great.	Bolýar, bu gaty gowy.
Maybe he never cared about you.	Belki, ol hiç wagt sen hakda alada etmedi.
Who would be better off?	Kime has gowy bolardy?
In fact, I didn't think much of it.	Aslynda kän pikir etmedim.
No sound.	Ses däl.
I don't want to be like that.	Men beýle bolmak islämok.
Can you tell us a little bit about that?	Bu hakda bize birneme aýdyp bilersiňizmi?
He started telling me things.	Ol maňa zatlar aýdyp başlady.
I saw it all.	Men hemmesini gördüm.
Something wonderful happened to me.	Maňa ajaýyp bir zat geldi.
It looked great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp ýalydy.
It was necessary for that.	Munuň üçin bolsa zerur boldy.
he said.	diýdi.
They are very difficult.	Olar gaty kyn bolýar.
It didn’t seem like a bad idea.	Bu erbet pikir däl ýalydy.
It is impossible to talk to him.	Onuň bilen gürleşmek mümkin däl.
There was someone else, there was always someone else.	Başga biri bardy, elmydama başga biri bardy.
And then I can worry about it.	Soň bolsa, bu barada alada edip bilerin.
We can go now	Biz şu wagt gidip bileris
More likely.	Has ähtimal.
He was not ready for that now.	Ol häzir muňa taýyn däldi.
You have to go home.	Öýe gitmeli.
What? 	Näme?
he said.	özi aýtdy.
It always has been and always will be.	Elmydama bardy we hemişe bolar.
I can still help him.	Men henizem oňa kömek edip bilerin.
He too.	Ol hem.
You can help us.	Bize kömek edip bilersiňiz.
Good guy	Gowy ýigit.
It's beautiful here.	Bu ýerde owadan.
There must be another way for me.	Maňa başga ýol bolmaly.
I did not object.	Men muňa garşy däldim.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It’s not a bit of a hassle.	Bu birneme biynjalyk däl.
This was not the case here.	Bu ýerde beýle däldi.
No one wants to confess.	Hiç kim muny boýun almak islemeýär.
I could not be alone	Men ýeke bolup bilmedim
He had nothing to say.	Başga hiç zat aýtmaly däldi.
He could not speak.	Ol gürläp bilmedi.
Maybe it won't be easy.	Belki aňsat bolmaz.
It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
I saw him there.	Men ony şol ýerde gördüm.
In fact, I never thought it would happen.	Aslynda munuň bolup biljekdigini asla pikir etmedim.
He couldn't think of them that way.	Ol olar hakda beýle pikir edip bilmedi.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
This was not surprising.	Bu geň zat däldi.
More fun than worrying about the future.	Geljek hakda alada etmekden has gyzykly ýol.
You have to do this every day.	Muny her gün etmeli.
Just to let you know.	Diňe size habar bermek.
This is no longer possible.	Indi bu mümkin däl.
Really difficult question.	Hakykatdanam kyn sorag.
It was a great day.	Bu ajaýyp gün boldy.
It sounds right, but it doesn't happen.	Bu dogry ýaly görünýär, ýöne bolmaz.
It would be long.	Uzak bolardy.
Not easy.	Aňsat däl.
Even both are good.	Hatda ikisi hem gowy.
He wants you.	Ol seni isleýär.
This may be earlier.	Bu has ir bolup biler.
I was a good person here.	Men bu ýerde birneme gowy adam boldum.
Good stuff is fun.	Gowy zat gyzykly zat.
Not like me.	Men ýaly däl.
It looks like that, maybe.	Şeýle görünýär, belki.
Maybe another week.	Belki ýene bir hepde.
Now may be the time.	Indi wagt bolup biler.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
Maybe it's just me.	Belki, bu diňe men.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
He wanted to do it.	Etjek boldy.
Not with you	Seniň bilen däl.
This has always been the case.	Elmydama şeýle boldy.
Not a big deal.	Uly iş däl.
You will only exist.	Siz diňe bar bolarsyňyz.
Okay, so it wasn’t just me.	Bolýar, şonuň üçin bu diňe men däldi.
Good.	Gowy.
He called the police again.	Ol ýene polisiýa jaň etdi.
It's almost time.	Wagty diýen ýaly.
I saw it myself.	Men muny özüm gördüm.
The problem is, this happens only once.	Mesele bu diňe bir gezek bolýar.
He was not bad.	Ol erbet däldi.
This is not true at all.	Bu asla dogry däl.
I'm calling.	Men jaň edýärin.
.	.
This is no longer the case.	Bu indi mesele däl.
This is a serious matter.	Bu çynlakaý iş.
One more thing.	Ýene bir zat.
He took it and did nothing.	Ol alyp, hiç zat etmedi.
This is an opportunity.	Bu bir mümkinçilik.
Of course, difficult.	Elbetde, kyn.
He must be one or two years older than me.	Ol, menden bir ýa-da iki ýaş uly bolsa gerek.
Nowadays they are everywhere.	Häzirki wagtda olar hemme ýerde.
It doesn't do that.	Muny beýle etmeýär.
And then he wants to talk.	Soň bolsa gürleşmek isleýär.
Police arrested him and arrested him.	Polisiýa ony tussag etdi we tussag etdi.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Summer is here.	Tomus geldi.
Then there is the sound.	Soň bir ses bar.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
He is himself.	Ol özi.
There is almost no work.	Iş ýok diýen ýaly.
Here in this house, here we are.	Ine, şu öýde, biz şu ýerde.
Apparently.	Görünýär.
Now he is alone.	Indi ol ýeke galdy.
I've always been	Men hemişe boldum.
I don't need it	Maňa gerek däl
I really don't like it	Men muny hakykatdanam halamok
I think you should go.	Meniň pikirimçe, gitmeli.
It took a while.	Bu birneme wagt aldy.
He doesn't know anyone else.	Başga birini bilmeýär.
Someone had to go.	Kimdir biri gitmeli boldy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat ajaýyp.
It can't be that way.	Beýle bolup bilmez.
Now he always said that.	Indi ol muny hemişe aýtdy.
Interesting.	Gyzykly.
It really helped a lot.	Bu hakykatdanam köp kömek etdi.
He doesn't want to.	Ol islemeýär.
He asked for an answer.	Ol jogap sorady.
He was with them.	Ol olar bilen boldy.
Everything about him called him.	Ol hakda hemme zat oňa jaň etdi.
So it will take some time.	Şonuň üçin biraz wagt gerek.
This is a good life.	Bu gowy durmuş.
This is serious.	Bu çynlakaý.
Nothing before.	Öň hiç zat ýok.
This may be the case here.	Bu ýerde şeýle bolup biler.
Seriously, these things never happen.	Çynlakaý, bu zatlar hiç haçan.
He said it was not a sound.	Ol munuň ses däldigini aýtdy.
And then what.	Soň bolsa näme.
Of course, everyone is different.	Elbetde, her kim başga.
Makes it all the more interesting.	Hemmesini has gyzykly edýär.
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
This and nothing else.	Bu we başga hiç zat ýok.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
He was here, but he had to leave.	Ol şu ýerde, ýöne gitmeli boldy.
he asked.	' diýip sorady.
He immediately understood.	Derrew düşündi.
Must be one.	Bir bolmaly.
I want you now	Men seni şu wagt isleýärin
That's really a lot.	Bu hakykatdanam köp.
I'm a different person now.	Men indi başga adam.
Bigger and better.	Uly we has gowy.
No one wanted to.	Hiç kim islemedi.
There was no one to say the least.	Aýtmak isleýän adam ýokdy.
This is what is needed.	Bu zerur zat.
It's like something else.	Bu başga zat ýaly.
Of course, this is not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däl.
Good.	Gowy.
Anyway, please.	Näme bolup biler, haýyş edýärin.
This is a bit true.	Bu birneme dogry.
The former is immediate.	Öňküsi derrew.
I was crazy, but not much.	Men däli boldum, ýöne kän däl.
It will be really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly bolar.
Neither we nor we.	Biz we ikimizem däl.
Maybe not anymore.	Belki, indi ýok.
I know what to do.	Näme etmelidigini bilýärin.
I think that was good.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gowy boldy.
Oh, he understands.	Aý, düşündi.
That can't be the case anymore.	Indi beýle bolup bilmez.
Just amazing fun.	Diňe ajaýyp gyzykly.
He was not alone here.	Ol bu ýerde ýeke däldi.
This is a mistake.	Bu bir ýalňyşlyk.
Today, this week, this month and this year.	Şu gün, şu hepde, şu aý we şu ýyl.
What should he do now?	Ol indi näme etmeli?
I shouldn't do that.	Men beýle etmeli däl.
It used to be.	Öň bardy.
He is still here.	Ol henizem şu ýerde.
Good job for the right girl.	Dogry gyz üçin gowy iş.
It's kind of weird.	Bir hili geň ýaly.
I don't know anything about them.	Men olar hakda hiç zat bilemok.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
I can try it on myself.	Özümi synap görüp bilerin.
Not good, but not bad.	Gowy däl, ýöne erbet däl.
Often not necessary.	Köplenç zerur däl.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu hem dogry.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
This thought bothered me.	Bu pikir meni biynjalyk etdi.
That was still not the case.	Bu henizem dogry däldi.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
There is no one around.	Bu barada hiç kim ýok.
It was not enough to see him.	Ony görmek ýeterlik däldi.
Of course, not everyone agrees.	Elbetde, hemmeler muňa razy däl.
He decided.	Ol karar berdi.
I know this is not possible.	Munuň mümkin däldigini bilýärin.
There are a number of issues here.	Bu ýerde birnäçe mesele bar.
Such things.	Şeýle zatlar.
Good.	Gowy.
This gave us time to leave.	Bu bize biraz wagt gitmäge wagt berdi.
Of course it was.	Elbetde, şeýle boldy.
This is not the case this week.	Bu hepde beýle däl.
You have to admit.	Siz boýun almaly.
I want to give.	Men bermek isleýärin.
He should never have said that.	Ol hiç wagt beýle zady aýtmaly däldi.
It's so beautiful.	Bu gaty owadan.
I have a question.	Mende bir sorag bar.
Everything was still there.	Hemme zat henizem bardy.
It took a long time.	Bu gaty köp wagt aldy.
This is a big deal.	Bu uly iş.
In fact, it was a great day.	Aslynda şol gün gaty gowy boldy.
That's a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir.
In fact, there is no such thing.	Aslynda munuň ýaly zat ýok.
I know he never spoke to her.	Bilýärin, hiç haçan oňa söz aýtmady.
He told me.	Ol maňa aýtdy.
She seemed really happy.	Ol hakykatdanam bagtly ýalydy.
He is always here too.	Ol hem hemişe şu ýerde.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
He is not.	Ol däl.
We will.	Biz olar.
What happened 	Näme boldy?
he said.	diýdi.
He didn’t tell me that, someone else said.	Ol maňa muny aýtmady, başga biri aýtdy.
She was very worried.	Ol gaty biynjalyk boldy.
We have to do something.	Biz bir zatlar etmeli.
Permission required.	Rugsat gerek.
He knows no one is here.	Ol bu ýerde hiç kimiň däldigini bilýär.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
Good and good, but no more.	Gowy we gowy, ýöne indi ýok.
He wanted to be one.	Ol bir bolmak isledi.
You used to	Sen ozal
I had never thought of that before.	Men ozal beýle pikir etmedim.
I just said it would be fun.	Diňe gyzykly boljakdygyny aýtdym.
Something seemed wrong.	Bir zat dogry däl ýalydy.
It's too far.	Bu gaty uzak.
I'm not very good at that.	Men muňa gaty gowy däl.
I did everything on my own.	Men hemme zady ýeke özüm etdim.
It was not necessary to see him again.	Ony ýene görmek hökman däldi.
He doesn't do that.	Ol muny etmeýär.
Life is so much fun.	Durmuş gaty gyzykly.
I couldn't get it	Men muny alyp bilmedim
The future is here.	Geljek şu ýerde.
You are the most beautiful	Sen iň owadan
What a stupid question.	Nähili samsyk sorag.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty owadan.
The word came out.	Söz çykdy.
He fell asleep.	Ol uklap galdy.
He didn't have to do that.	Muny etmeli däldi.
It was not so much.	Bu beýle kän däldi.
This is exactly what happened.	Bu hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
And then	Soň bolsa
It's been a night.	Bir gije boldy.
Of course, this is not possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin däl.
What is right for you is right for you.	Siziň üçin dogry zat diňe siziň üçin dogry.
It will be difficult.	Bu kyn bolar.
I do.	Men edýärin.
He said he could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmejekdigini aýtdy.
Of course, this is a big lie.	Elbetde, bu gaty ýalan.
Always, always good.	Elmydama, elmydama gowy.
I was alone.	Men ýeke özüm boldum.
Not really for me, for them.	Aslynda meniň üçin kän däl, olar üçin.
He is still here.	Ol henizem şu ýerde.
Everything is more beautiful.	Hemme zat has owadan.
Definitely hard.	Elbetde kyn.
He is very busy.	Işi bilen gaty meşgul.
So have fun.	Şonuň üçin hezil etmek.
No one could agree.	Hiç kim razy bolup bilmedi.
Who's there	Kim ol ýerde.
He said he wanted to buy.	Satyn almak isleýändigini aýtdy.
Necessary.	Zerur.
I thought it would be good.	Gowy bolar öýdüpdim.
That's exactly what happened.	Munuň özi edil şonuň üçin.
It was two.	Iki boldy.
Bad, it's a long way off.	Erbet, bu uzak ýol.
Of course, there is no problem with that.	Elbetde, munuň üçin kynçylyk ýok.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
This is indeed true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry.
This is also available.	Bu hem bar.
It should be good.	Gowy bolmaly.
It took a while.	Biraz wagt gerek boldy.
Many things are not new.	Kän zat täze däl.
He calls.	Ol jaň edýär.
Of course he did.	Elbetde, muny etdi.
Not today.	Bu gün däl.
This is his business day.	Bu onuň iş güni.
He always knew that.	Ol muny elmydama bilýärdi.
I haven't tried it before.	Men ozal synap görmedim.
Maybe he did a good job.	Belki, onuň eden gowy işi.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Where is he	Ol nirede.
Everyone knows everything.	Hemmeler hemme zady bilýär.
He was no one.	Ol hiç kim däldi.
These things are great	Bu zatlar gaty gowy
Because you are beautiful.	Sebäbi sen owadan.
Now that would be a huge problem.	Indi bu gaty uly mesele bolar.
I really will.	Men hakykatdanam ederin.
He didn't think much.	Ol kän pikir etmedi.
This seems very strange.	Bu gaty geň görünýär.
Not now, not now.	Ol däl, häzir däl.
This is the only thing.	Bu ýeke-täk zat.
He told us to go.	Ol bize gitmeli diýdi.
Of course, this month will be better.	Elbetde, bu aý has gowy bolar.
He was not ready for that.	Ol muňa taýyn däldi.
He could not tell her.	Ol oňa aýdyp bilmedi.
You really are	Siz hakykatdanam
I really don't know what happened this time.	Hakykatdanam bu gezek näme bolandygyny bilemok.
Whatever you need.	Näme gerek bolsa.
He did not immediately respond.	Ol derrew jogap bermedi.
It could be one day.	Bir gün bolup biler.
You can be very good.	Siz gaty gowy bolup bilersiňiz.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
The man advised me.	Ol adam maňa maslahat berdi.
Good if possible.	Mümkin bolsa gowy.
I got one.	Men birini aldym.
Of course, I obeyed.	Elbetde, boýun boldum.
We agree.	Biz muňa razy.
This will also be a problem.	Bu hem bir kynçylyk bolar.
The only reason is definitely.	Diňe sebäbi hökman.
Of course, she was not a girl.	Elbetde, ol gyz däldi.
It's not that difficult.	Bu beýle kyn däl.
He knew nothing about it.	Ol bu barada hiç zat bilmeýärdi.
There is another possibility.	Başga bir mümkinçilik bar.
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
In fact, there are both.	Aslynda ikisi-de iki gezek bar.
He told her.	Ol oňa aýtdy.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
He did not.	Beýle etmedi.
It didn't take long.	Asla wagt gerek däldi.
Almost no one.	Hiç kim diýen ýaly däl.
Too much indeed.	Hakykatdanam gaty köp.
It helped.	Bu kömek etdi.
Tell me a little bit about yourself.	Özüňiz hakda biraz aýdyň.
To do the right thing.	Dogry etmek üçin.
What to do?	Haýsy etmeli?
We need help.	Bize kömek etmegine mätäç.
Nothing happened yet.	Entek bir zat ýokdy.
I hope you agree.	Razy bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin.
So it would be time for him.	Şonuň üçin onuň wagty bolardy.
There would always be something there.	Ol ýerde elmydama bir zat bolardy.
I'm not against it.	Men muňa garşy däl.
Just a song.	Diňe bir aýdym.
He has to go to work.	Ol işe gitmeli.
He had fun today.	Ol şu gün hezil etdi.
We can't go now.	Indi gidip bilmeris.
This is one thing.	Bu bir zat.
This is completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga.
That can only be a good thing.	Bu diňe gowy zat bolup biler.
Say it all.	Hemmesini aýdyň.
There was no answer to that.	Munuň üçin jogap ýokdy.
I didn’t even try.	Men hatda synap görmedim.
What now	Häzir näme?
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
I can't really tell you.	Aslynda saňa aýdyp biljek däl.
No one has ever cared about him before.	Öň hiç kim onuň hakda alada etmedi.
No more money.	Indi pul ýokdy.
The man said everywhere.	Adam hemme ýerde aýtdy.
There is a reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi bar.
I'm here for you.	Men seniň üçin şu ýerde.
You have a problem.	Sen mesele.
This word again	Bu söz ýene
I'm not crazy	Men däli däl.
It seemed impossible.	Mümkin däl ýalydy.
He fell asleep.	Ol uklap galdy.
I hope he does.	Ol eder diýip umyt edýärin.
Of course, it was possible.	Elbetde, mümkin boldy.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
He says he can't take us.	Bizi alyp bilmejekdigini aýdýar.
I will take care of everything.	Men hemme zady alada ederin.
Often only the two of us happen.	Köplenç diňe ikimiz bolýar.
She started talking again.	Ol ýene gürläp başlady.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu gün bize gerek däl zat.
These are really interesting things.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly zatlar.
He says a lot.	Köp zat aýdýar.
I think he did a great job tonight.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gije gaty gowy etdi.
'.	'.
He thought you were too.	Ol hem seniň diýip pikir etdi.
Already always.	Eýýäm hemişe.
I want to talk to you	Men siziň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin
He is already crazy.	Ol eýýäm däli.
He received an immediate response.	Derrew jogap aldy.
And you two girls.	Siz bolsa iki gyz.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
Okay, you can do that.	Bolýar, muny edip bilersiňiz.
There was no reason for that.	Munuň sebäbi ýokdy.
What, have fun.	Näme, hezil et.
He needs you.	Ol saňa mätäç.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
He said it was impossible.	Munuň mümkin däldigini aýtdy.
This will not be the last.	Bu hem iň soňky bolmaz.
This is not the first time.	Bu bir gezek däl.
That’s not the word for me, you.	Meniň üçin bu söz däl, sen.
That's right.	Edil şeýle.
We had two last week.	Geçen hepde ikimiz bardy.
Not always good.	Elmydama gowy däl.
Not to anyone.	Hiç kime däl.
Tell me.	Maňa aýdyň.
Someone told me he just wanted to give me money.	Bir adam maňa diňe pul bermek isleýändigini aýtdy.
It will always be that way.	Elmydama şeýle bolar.
Seems enough together.	Bilelikde ýeterlik ýaly görünýär.
That is the only hope.	Diňe şol umyt.
That could be the case.	Şeýle bolup biler.
He even knew that.	Hatda ol muny bilýärdi.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
You are a big girl	Sen uly gyz
We are not close or anything else.	Biz ýakyn ýa-da başga zat däl.
Of course, there were a lot of people there.	Elbetde, ol ýerde köp adam bardy.
I wondered what else he would think of me.	Men hakda başga näme pikir eder öýdüpdim.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
I'm not going to bother.	Meni biynjalyk etjek däl.
In fact, it is not for me.	Aslynda bu meniň üçin däl.
I didn’t think about questioning what he did.	Men onuň näme edenini sorag etmek hakda pikir etmedim.
I wonder what happened to me.	Maňa näme boldy diýip pikir edýärin.
Of course it is.	Elbetde, şeýle.
Tell me what to do.	Näme etmelidigimi aýdyň.
It happens.	Bu bolýar.
That would be great.	Bu gaty ajaýyp bolardy.
He was late.	Ol gijä galdy.
Oh, she was beautiful too.	Aý, ol hem owadan boldy.
Of course this is a good thing.	Elbetde bu gowy zat.
It's been a while.	Biraz wagt boldy.
It's hard to pay attention.	Üns bermek kyn.
He is almost there.	Ol diýen ýaly.
He had to go.	Ol gitmeli boldy.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
He also came out quickly.	Ol hem çalt çykdy.
That's it.	Edil şu.
Maybe he'll come back.	Belki gaýdyp geler.
Which is bigger.	Haýsy uly.
he asked.	diýip sorady.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
She was amazed.	Oňa haýran galdy.
That first evening was late.	Şol ilkinji agşam gijä galdy.
He could see nothing else.	Başga hiç zat görüp bilmedi.
I didn't think much.	Kän pikir etmedim.
He was not himself.	Ol özi däldi.
Then came another thought.	Soň oňa başga bir pikir geldi.
I need it now.	Maňa şu wagt gerek.
And then it was a lie.	Soň bolsa ýalan boldy.
At that time.	Şol wagt.
What a nice day	Nähili gowy gün.
There is everything for that.	Munuň üçin bar zat bar.
Too bad for work.	Iş üçin gaty erbet.
OK, very good.	Bolýar, gaty gowy.
They are not just beautiful.	Olar diňe bir owadan däl.
I can only speak for myself.	Men diňe özüm üçin gürläp bilerin.
It was hard.	Bu kyn boldy.
It wasn't you.	Aslynda sen däldi.
Nothing else happened.	Başga hiç zat bolup bilmedi.
Not just one.	Diňe bir däl.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Okay, maybe.	Bolýar, mümkin.
Easy, it should be.	Aňsat, bolmaly.
We are together	Biz bilelikde.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle bolmaly däldi.
I can't see anything	Men bir zady görüp bilemok
Someone, something else is here.	Kimdir biri, başga bir zat şu ýerde.
He knew it was there.	Ol munuň bardygyny bilýärdi.
I don't think that's possible.	Bu mümkin däl diýip pikir edýärin.
He was amazed or something.	Ol haýran galdy ýa-da bir zat.
Something wonderful happened.	Ajaýyp bir zat boldy.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
She is so beautiful.	Ol gaty owadan.
I have already seen one.	Men eýýäm birini gördüm.
That evening.	Şol gün agşam.
He couldn't do that either.	Şeýle hem edip bilmedi.
He understood.	Oňa düşündi.
Needless to say, now.	Indi aýtmak hökman däldi.
It will take some time.	Biraz wagt gerek bolar.
And then you have to be alone.	Soň bolsa ýeke-täk bolmaly.
That's a lot of time.	Şol wagt köp.
I saw him this morning.	Men ony şu gün irden gördüm.
That's exactly what happened.	Edil şonuň ýaly boldy.
There is concern about this.	Bu barada alada bar.
That would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolar.
This is a beautiful book.	Bu owadan kitap.
He didn't think about it.	Ol bu hakda pikir etmedi.
That's all.	Diňe şu.
I will not!	Men bolmaz!
No one else could see it.	Başga hiç kim görüp bilmedi.
There were other things.	Başga zatlar hem bardy.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
Great! 	Ajaýyp!
He knew it would be the last.	Munuň iň soňky boljakdygyny bilýärdi.
Of course it was possible.	Elbetde mümkin boldy.
This is a very interesting thing.	Bu gaty gyzykly zat.
More will come.	Has köp zat geler.
Then he came to her.	Soň bolsa oňa geldi.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
He wants to be like that.	Ol şeýle bolmak isleýär.
You have to do it really well.	Muny hakykatdanam gowy etmeli.
.	.
Just something for you.	Diňe seniň üçin bir zat.
I called him.	Men oňa jaň etdim.
I will have no problem.	Menden kynçylyk bolmaz.
There is no answer to that right now.	Häzir oňa jogap ýok.
Of course, I did it again.	Elbetde, ýene bir gezek etdim.
In fact, everything.	Aslynda hemme zat.
He knows that.	Muny bilýär.
I couldn't do that before.	Men muny öň edip bilmedim.
He asked me the right thing.	Ol menden dogry sorady.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
It would be crazy.	Bu däli bolar.
In fact, there is no working time.	Aslynda, iş wagty ýok.
Big.	Uly.
Work will be needed.	Iş gerek bolar.
For a better sound.	Has gowy ses üçin.
I knew it was impossible.	Munuň mümkin däldigini bilýärdim.
This is always the case.	Elmydama şu.
It can't even be done.	Hatda edip bolmaz.
I confessed.	Men boýun aldym.
I have to do it myself.	Muny özüm etmeli.
He could not get it.	Ol muny alyp bilmedi.
He already knew enough about it.	Ol bu hakda eýýäm ýeterlik bilýärdi.
Just like before.	Edil öňküsi ýaly.
I don't do it anymore.	Indi etmeýärin.
He was there, but he was not there.	Ol şol ýerde, ýöne ol ýerde däldi.
Good money.	Gowy pul.
He was not ready for it yet.	Ol entek oňa taýyn bolup bilmedi.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu düýbünden dogry däl.
There was no sound.	Ses ýokdy.
They are very happy.	Olar gaty bagtly.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It just didn't work out.	Diňe gowy bolup bilmedi.
Maybe he shouldn’t have said that.	Belki, ol muny aýtmaly däldi.
The reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi.
There was something very bad about him.	Ol hakda gaty erbet bir zat bardy.
Something is wrong.	Bir zat dogry däl.
I had a day off	Bir gün dynç aldym
There was something about them.	Olar hakda bir zat bardy.
Tonight is for you.	Bu gije siziň üçin.
It's not good, it's not good at all.	Bu gowy däl, asla gowy däl.
He wanted to help her.	Oňa kömek etmek isledi.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
I don't like it at all	Men muny asla halamok
And things, things and other things.	We zatlar, zatlar we başga zatlar.
This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
I just thought.	Men diňe pikir etdim.
Sorry for the inconvenience.	Kynçylyk üçin bagyşlaň.
Someone wants to do that.	Kimdir biri muny etmek isleýär.
There is also no time.	Şeýle hem wagt ýok.
That's more than that.	Bu mundan has kän.
Not much.	Kän däl.
This is not a big deal.	Bu beýle bir uly mesele däl.
This is never fun.	Bu hiç wagt gyzykly däl.
I have it now.	Indi mende bar.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda olar üçin başga zat ýok.
We can do that now.	Muny indi edip bileris.
As you know, just as you know.	Bilýän ýaly, edil bilýän ýaly.
There will only be a lot of opportunity for that.	Munuň üçin diňe köp mümkinçilik bolar.
Great day	Ajaýyp gün.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe bir zat etmeli.
Last but not least.	Iň soňky.
Bad, very bad.	Erbet, gaty erbet.
Not happy.	Bagtly däl.
It was like a girl for him.	Bu onuň üçin gyz ýalydy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň özi bolmaly.
We didn't need much.	Bize kän zat gerek däldi.
He wants to hurt us.	Ol bize zyýan bermek isleýär.
That he can buy.	Satyn alyp biljekdigini.
There is really no other way.	Hakykatdanam başga mümkinçilik ýok.
You can say something else for me.	Meniň üçin başga bir zat aýdyp bilersiňiz.
The police do not want to know.	Polisiýa bilmek islemeýär.
Very true.	Gaty we dogry.
This is really the last question.	Bu hakykatdanam soňky sorag.
Time, it seems, is never enough.	Wagt, hiç haçan ýeterlik däl ýaly.
I didn’t care about myself.	Men özüm hakda alada etmedim.
Of course, she was not beautiful either.	Elbetde, ol hem owadan däldi.
You have to go	Sen gitmeli
Nor is it necessarily.	Şeýle hem hökman däl.
A lot of things in fact.	Aslynda köp zatlar.
I don't help much.	Men kän kömek etmeýärin.
Of course he does.	Elbetde, muny edýär.
It's two o'clock.	Bu iki sagat.
He was very surprised.	Ol muňa gaty geň galdy.
I did a lot of work for him here.	Men bu ýerde onuň üçin köp iş etdim.
Nothing else will happen.	Başga zat bolmaz.
I didn't care.	Men alada etmedim.
Of course it will be.	Elbetde şeýle bolar.
Not a bad life.	Erbet durmuş däl.
This is both good and bad.	Bu hem gowy, hem erbet.
More likely.	Has ähtimal.
I was home all day.	Men bütin gün öýde boldum.
This is the current issue.	Bu häzirki mesele.
He did really well.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy etdi.
He may have known something.	Ol bir zady bilýän bolmagy mümkin.
I don't need it	Maňa gerek däl
This is for me.	Bu meniň üçin.
It would be interesting.	Gyzykly bolardy.
Definitely new.	Elbetde täze.
Seriously.	Çynlakaý aýtdy.
They are very good.	Olar gaty gowy.
Good idea, isn't it?	Gowy pikir, şeýlemi?
I made you a girl.	Men seni gyz etdim.
Sun! 	Gün!
That should not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däldi.
No one knows.	Hiç kim bilenok.
I'm not very good.	Men gaty gowy däl.
She began to worry about the guy.	Ol ýigit hakda alada edip başlady.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
Everyone knew that.	Muny hemmeler bilýärdi.
There is no one but me.	Menden başga hiç kim ýok.
I don't think you should.	Sen bolmaly däl öýdemok.
He never spoke.	Ol hiç haçan söz aýtmady.
He did not ask any questions.	Ol hiç hili sorag bermedi.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
She is so good to me.	Ol maňa şeýle gowy.
This is not his.	Bu onuň däl.
It's actually worse.	Aslynda has erbet.
And then there was the worry again.	Soň bolsa ýene alada galdy.
There is no one else there.	Ol ýerde başga hiç kim ýok.
I hope it's good.	Gowy diýip umyt edýärin.
It will not be easy for you.	Size aňsat bolmaz.
I'll do it right.	Dogry ederin.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu dogry däl.
Not a good word.	Gowy söz däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Diňe şeýle bolýar, mesele seniň.
I know this a lot.	Men muny köp bilýärin.
He said.	Diýdi.
The question is back.	Sorag gaýdyp geldi.
Probably not.	Kän zat däl bolsa gerek.
He didn't do much.	Has köp zat etmedi.
Just for me.	Edil meniň üçin.
What is happening now.	Häzirki wagtda näme bolýar.
You know, here, with me.	Bilýärsiň, şu ýerde, meniň bilen.
He was nobody and nothing.	Ol hiç kim we hiç zat däldi.
Really, really great things.	Hakykatdanam, hakykatdanam ajaýyp zatlar.
That would be true.	Bu dogry bolar.
It was kind of good.	Bu bir hili gowy boldy.
I did not.	Men etmedim.
She looks really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy görünýär.
No one does that.	Hiç kim muny etmeýär.
About it.	Bu hakda.
I don't know how.	Nädip bilemok.
Of course, I don't know anything.	Elbetde, hiç zady bilemok.
OK, maybe that is possible.	Bolýar, belki mümkin bolup biler.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
Okay, both.	Bolýar, ikisi-de bolsa.
It was a wonderful night.	Bu ajaýyp gije boldy.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
Everything was the same.	Hemme zat öňküsi ýalydy.
I am completely crazy.	Men düýbünden däli.
Someone who wants to be with.	Bilen bolmak isleýän biri.
He decided to do something about it.	Ol bu barada bir zat etmek kararyna geldi.
"It's something," he said.	Ol: "Bu bir zat" -diýdi.
What a wonderful life.	Nähili ajaýyp durmuş.
Someone got it.	Kimdir biri aldy.
He did whatever he wanted.	Islän zadyny etdi.
Not a lot of things really happen.	Köp zat hakykatdanam köp däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe iş.
It was clear here.	Bu ýerde aýdyň boldy.
I can do something for you.	Men seniň üçin bir zat edip bilerin.
He is a really good guy.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy ýigit.
He wanted her to call him.	Ol özüne jaň etmegini isledi.
I've had a lot.	Maňa gaty köp zat geldi.
He didn't give me that chance.	Ol maňa beýle mümkinçilik bermedi.
That's one thing.	Ine bir zat.
This is very difficult for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty kyn.
He immediately confessed.	Ol derrew boýun aldy.
Because it will be crazy.	Sebäbi bu däli bolar.
It was a great time.	Bu wagt gaty gowy boldy.
That's what they did.	Bu olar etdi.
That's right.	Dogry.
Bar.	Bar.
In fact, that's exactly what he did.	Aslynda bu onuň eden zady.
I offered you.	Men saňa teklip etdim.
That's the message.	Ol habar.

He helped.	Ol kömek etdi.
Nothing can take that away.	Hiç zat muny alyp bilmez.
That's enough for me.	Ine, meniň üçin ýeterlik.
It already existed.	Bu öňem bardy.
I had to rest.	Men dynç almaly boldum.
He gave me an idea.	Maňa bir pikir berdi.
Everyone knows that.	Bu barada hemmeler bilýär.
It turned out well.	Gowy çykdy.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
He has so much to do.	Ol munuň üçin gaty köp zat.
You will only be fine.	Siz diňe gowy bolarsyňyz.
There is still a way to go.	Entek gitmeli ýol bar.
There was work for him.	Onuň üçin iş bardy.
A few new faces.	Birnäçe täze ýüz.
They are very close now.	Olar indi gaty ýakyn.
She is as beautiful as she is.	Ol edil özi ýaly ajaýyp.
He did not answer.	Ol jogap bermedi.
We can be smart.	Biz akylly bolup bileris.
There are several reasons.	Birnäçe sebäp bar.
One thing bothered me.	Bir zat meni biynjalyk etdi.
This was nothing new.	Bu täze zat däldi.
It was a little fun.	Biraz wagt hezil boldy.
This is still the case.	Bu henizem şeýle bolýar.
I was not like that at all.	Men asla beýle däldim.
Now everything is fine.	Indi hemme zat gowy.
He asked for the impossible.	Mümkin däl zatlary sorady.
He was immediately disturbed.	Ol derrew biynjalyk boldy.
Almost everything.	Hemme zat diýen ýalydy.
One thing for sure.	Elbetde, bir zat.

I'll be there	Men şol ýerde bolaryn
I think it would be great for that.	Munuň üçin gaty gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
Of course, this time it will be the same.	Elbetde, bu gezek hem şeýle bolar.
I just want to do everything.	Men diňe hemme zady etmek isleýärin.
He did not want to go alone.	Ol ýeke gitmek islemedi.

Nothing is easy.	Hiç zat aňsat däl.
Many	Köp.
He thought it through very well.	Ol muny gaty gowy pikir etdi.
This can happen in two ways.	Bu iki ýol bilen bolup biler.
He knows everything.	Ol hemme zady bilýär.
Everyone's truth is a lie.	Her kimiň hakykaty ýalan.
I was like that.	Men şeýle boldum.
Not you.	Saňa däl.
A lot of people told me that.	Köp adam maňa muny aýtdy.
Many, many hours.	Köp, köp sagat.
What bothered me the most.	Meni gaty biynjalyk eden zat.
I think that should be the case.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol düýbünden şeýle bolmaly.
It was still there today.	Bu gün henizem bardy.
Good.	Gowy.
You are still here.	Sen henizem şu ýerde.
This is certainly not the case.	Bu, elbetde, dogry däl.
Everyone needs it.	Hemmeler zerur.
I am young.	Men ýaş.
This is good too.	Bu hem gowy.
Of course, I got the big one.	Elbetde, uly zady aldym.
There is a very good reason for this.	Munuň üçin gaty gowy sebäp bar.
There are so many types it's hard to say.	Muňa sebäp bolup biljek zatlar kän.
I still can't believe it.	Men henizem ynanamok.
I am not.	Men, beýle däl.
Of course, the evening was very difficult.	Elbetde, agşam gaty kyn boldy.
Of course, this is not the case, but it is.	Elbetde, bu ir däl, ýöne şeýle boldy.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.

He thought it would be over.	Ol muny bes et diýip pikir etdi.
How stupid he is.	Ol nähili samsyk.
This is my first.	Bu meniň ilkinji.
I didn’t do any of that.	Men munuň hiç birini etmedim.
This is not the case for me.	Meniň üçin bu beýle däl.
That's what he wants for us right now.	Ine, şu wagt biziň üçin isleýän zady.
There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
There is no problem there.	Ol ýerde kynçylyk ýok.
There weren't many people, so it's good.	Adam köp däldi, şonuň üçin gowy.
This is complete and false.	Bu doly we ýalan.
This is not what you need.	Bu size gerek zat däl.
I just want to be with you.	Men diňe siziň bilen bolmak isleýärin.
It took two days.	Iki gün gerek boldy.
He thinks it's very interesting.	Ol gaty gyzykly diýip pikir edýär.

He didn't know what to do.	Näme kömek et, bilmedi.
Money is good.	Pul gowy.

That seemed reasonable.	Bu ýeterlik ýalydy.
I do not have.	Mende ýok.
Just a few suggestions.	Diňe birnäçe teklip.
I want to be happier.	Men has bagtly bolmak isleýärin.
He must have seen it this morning.	Ony şu gün irden gören bolmaly.
And then he worried about me.	Soň bolsa ol meniň üçin alada galdy.
I'm not ready yet.	Men entek taýyn däl.
He knows everything.	Ol hemme zady bilýär.
This man is bad	Bu adam erbet
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu ýerde umyt bilen şeýle.

It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
I have to say it all.	Hemmesini aýtmaly.
He knew now.	Ol indi bilýärdi.
It just won’t be that fast.	Diňe beýle çalt bolmaz.
This was stated by several people.	Muny birnäçe adam aýtdy.
He called immediately.	Derrew jaň etdi.
He never told me.	Ol maňa hiç haçan aýtmady.
This is strange, but it was not.	Bu geň zat, ýöne beýle däldi.
I stopped thinking about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etmegi bes etdim.
It will not be easy, but it is not possible.	Bu aňsat bolmaz, ýöne mümkin däl.
I allowed him to do whatever he wanted.	Men oňa islän zadyny etmäge rugsat berdim.
Maybe that wasn’t the right thing to do.	Belki, bu dogry zat däldi.
A long time ago, someone was there.	Köp wagt ozal kimdir biri bardy.
The good news is that you can do something now.	Gowy habar, indi bir zat edip bilersiňiz.
You will need it.	Size gerek bolar.
The time is now and now.	Wagt şu wagt we şu wagt.
It's really frustrating to see that.	Muny görmek hakykatdanam biynjalyk.
You need	Size gerek
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
He had no idea.	Onuň bilen hiç hili pikir ýokdy.
Easy.	Aňsat.
In fact, I didn't want to do that.	Aslynda muny etmek islemedim.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
More and more police are coming.	Has köp polisiýa gelýär.
No one thinks about it.	Hiç kim bu barada pikir etmeýär.
In fact, you can do that there.	Aslynda, şol ýerde edip bilersiňiz.
He helped her.	Oňa kömek etdi.
I don’t know how to do that.	Muny nädip etmelidigini bilemok.
I never thought about it.	Men bu hakda asla pikir etmedim.
It was good for him.	Bu oňa gowy boldy.
I did nothing.	Men hiç zat etmedim.
It didn’t seem to be against it.	Muňa garşy däl ýalydy.
This may not be enough.	Bu hatda ýeterlik däl bolup biler.
The advice is correct.	Maslahat dogry.
No one questioned him.	Hiç kim ony sorag etmedi.
This is very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly.
Great to get.	Almak üçin ajaýyp.
I can't agree with that.	Men muňa razy bolup bilemok.
Someone here knows that.	Bu ýerde kimdir biri muny bilýär.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
I think he knew that.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol muny bilýärdi.
Good.	Gowy.
I obeyed.	Men boýun boldum.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
Someone who doesn't need it anymore.	Indi oňa mätäç däl biri.
Today is the last day.	Ine, şu gün iň soňky gün.
Like for the first time.	Ilkinji gezek ýaly.
Right now	Edil şu wagt.
He does everything and does very well.	Hemme zady edýär we gaty gowy edýär.
It didn't help much.	Bu kän bir kömek etmedi.
Not at all.	Asla däl.
No time now.	Indi wagt ýok.
It's so easy.	Munuň ýaly aňsat.
Everything is fine.	Hemme zat gaty gowy.
They will still be.	Olar henizem bolar.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hili zat.
he asked.	diýip sorady.
Just a lie.	Edil ýalan.
She seems happier for that.	Ol munuň üçin has bagtly görünýär.
I just can't do it myself.	Men muny diňe özüm edip bilemok.
Always me, me, me.	Elmydama men, men, men.
He did not want to speak to police.	Ol häzir polisiýa bilen gürleşmek islemedi.
There are several answers to this.	Muňa birnäçe jogap bar.
That sounds interesting.	Bu gyzykly ýaly.
Knowing will help him a lot.	Bilmek oňa köp kömek eder.
Neither responded.	Ikisi-de jogap bermedi.
The girl was amazed.	Gyz haýran galdy.
He knows the truth.	Ol hakykaty bilýär.
He did, he did.	Ol etdi, aldy.
He can't speak.	Ol gürläp bilmeýär.
In fact, it is never possible.	Hakykatdanam, bu hiç wagt mümkin bolup bilmez.
It will be good	Gowy bolar
A man came.	Bir adam geldi.
I called	Men jaň etdim
He could not see her.	Ol ony görüp bilmedi.
No one did much.	Hiç kim kän zat etmedi.
This is always difficult.	Bu elmydama kyn.
There was no time for that.	Munuň üçin wagty ýokdy.
Maybe he gave it to me.	Belki, ol maňa berdi.
This is not yet true.	Bu entek gaty dogry däldi.
Nothing now.	Indi hiç zat ýok.
It should be big enough for you.	Bu siziň üçin ýeterlik uly bolmaly.
This could also be a mistake.	Bu hem ýalňyşlyk bolup biler.
He didn't want to.	Ol muny islemedi.
He didn't have to do anything.	Ol hiç zat etmeli däldi.
This is probably true.	Bu dogry bolsa gerek.
I think the time has come.	Meniň pikirimçe, wagt geldi.
He told me.	Ol maňa aýtdy.
I will always be here.	Men hemişe şu ýerde bolaryn.
I asked you.	Men senden haýyş etdim.
She is still beautiful.	Ol henizem owadan.
Always close	Hemişe ýakyn.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
She is the most beautiful.	Ol iň owadan.
Surprisingly, that was not the case.	Geň zat, beýle däldi.
This was not even true.	Bu hatda dogry hem däldi.
It was not enough.	Ol munuň üçin ýeterlik däldi.
No one was needed.	Hiç biri zerur däldi.
I think that's a good idea.	Bu gowy pikir diýip pikir edýärin.
I'm not that big.	Men beýle uly däl.
.	.
He said you know that too.	Ol hem muny bilýärsiň diýdi.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
Of course not, of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi, elbetde beýle däldi.
It was good to pay attention.	Üns bermek gowy boldy.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Dogry gitmeli zatlar hem ýok.
Now he didn't have to worry about anything.	Indi ol hiç zat hakda alada etmeli däldi.
Not much.	Kän zat ýok.
I didn't know that.	Men muny bilmeýärdim.
It's fun.	Bu hezil.
I'm not.	Men düýbünden ýok.
The last suggestion is not the same as before.	Soňky teklip öňküsi ýaly däl.
Of course there are things you shouldn’t do.	Elbetde etmeli däl zatlar bar.
It could be with him.	Onuň bilen bolup biler.
That may be true.	Dogry bolup biler.
It took a while.	Bu birneme wagt aldy.
He said he could not do that.	Muny edip bilmejekdigini aýtdy.
Whatever happens, it will happen.	Näme bolar, bolar.
A new man came to his house.	Öýüne täze adam geldi.
It looks good.	Gowy görünýär.
So we can't do that either.	Şonuň üçin biz muny hem edip bilmeris.
Mostly.	Köplenç.
They have to be there.	Olar şol ýerde bolmaly.
Everything was possible.	Hemme zat mümkin boldy.
We have to be hard.	Biz gaty bolmaly.
No problem.	Mesele ýok.
I think that's right.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu dogry.
Both are no longer with us.	Ikisi-de indi biziň bilen däl.
That should be good.	Bu gowy bolmaly.
That's all.	Bu hemme zat.
And that would be foolish.	Bu bolsa samsyk bir zat edýär.
I had to help you.	Men saňa kömek etmeli boldum.
To have something happen.	Bir zadyň bolmagy üçin.
I doubt he can.	Edip biljekdigine şübhelenýärin.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
It looks worse.	Bu has erbet görünýär.
It can't hurt.	Zyýan berip bilmez.
I was not surprised.	Ony geň görmedim.
He was alone.	Ol ýeke boldy.
There was never a reason for that.	Munuň hiç haçan sebäbi ýokdy.
I admire you.	Men saňa haýran.
This is something else.	Bu başga bir zat.
I'm not really.	Men hakykatdanam beýle däl.
Which one will it be?	Haýsy bolar?
Oh, here it is.	Aý, ine.
You don't have to do that.	Muny etmek hökman däl.
So we are against it.	Şonuň üçin biz muňa garşy.
Of course, this is easy.	Elbetde, bu aňsat.
It may take time.	Munuň üçin wagt gerek bolup biler.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
It was the last.	Iň soňky boldy.
I had to be with you.	Men seniň bilen bolmaly boldum.
He really knew.	Ol hakykatdanam bilýärdi.
He can do that.	Ol muny edip biler.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He didn't want to talk about it last time.	Geçen gezek bu hakda gürleşmek islemedi.
Everyone has a great time.	Her kimiň wagty gaty gowy.
This question is very difficult.	Bu sorag gaty kyn bolýar.
Not many people know that.	Köp adam muny bilmeýär.
You know he can't.	Edip bilmejekdigini bilýärsiň.
He is often there.	Ol köplenç şol ýerde.
It's two o'clock in the morning.	Irden sagat iki boldy.
Of course it happened.	Elbetde boldy.
It should be that way and it should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly we şeýle bolmaly.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolmaly däl.
It will be very bad.	Bu gaty erbet bolar.
I was very worried about you.	Men sen hakda gaty alada etdim.
He did not allow me.	Ol maňa rugsat bermedi.
This is what happened to me this year.	Bu ýyl meniň üçin şeýle boldy.
We are almost at home.	Biz öýde diýen ýaly.
There is always someone who knows something.	Elmydama bir zady bilýän biri bar.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, şeýle bolar.
I have to be there	Men ol ýerde bolmaly
You don't even have to.	Sen hatda ýok.
This happened a few weeks later.	Bu birnäçe hepde soň boldy.
It was nothing for me.	Bu meniň üçin hiç zat däldi.
She is very smart.	Ol gaty akylly.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak gaty kyn.
That's it.	Ine, şeýle.
There was something about it.	Bu hakda bir zat bardy.
I didn't want to think about it now.	Men häzir onuň hakda pikir etmek islemedim.
I told her everything.	Men oňa hemmesini aýtdym.
It's really hard.	Hakykatdanam gaty kyn.
He didn't want to know either.	Ol hem bilmek islemedi.
We are not there yet.	Biz entek ýok.
I didn't think so.	Men beýle eder öýdemokdym.
I need some help.	Maňa biraz kömek gerek.
I think it turned out really well.	Meniň pikirimçe, hakykatdanam gowy çykdy.
Good for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin gowy.
I want to, but it will be a lie.	Men isleýärin, ýöne ýalan bolar.
Why is that?	Näme üçin beýle bolýar?
Not so bad this time.	Bu gezek beýle erbet däl.
It's always great.	Hemişe gaty gowy.
There was no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýokdy.
I will do everything for you.	Men seniň üçin hemme zady ederin.
He thought it was strange.	Bu geň zat diýip pikir etdi.
So everything will be fine.	Şonuň üçin hemme zat gowy bolar.
It was never bad in the morning.	Irden hiç wagt erbet däldi.
This is great.	Bu ajaýyp.
It's very difficult now.	Indi gaty kyn.
They are beautiful.	Olar owadan.
Then another came.	Soň başga biri geldi.
He did not want to hurt her.	Ol oňa zyýan bermek islemedi.
I could sleep here.	Men bu ýerde uklap bilýärdim.
This is not necessarily the case.	Bu hökman däl, şeýle hem bolmaly däl.
So it was good to talk to him.	Şonuň üçin onuň bilen gürleşmek gowy boldy.
I admire that.	Men muňa haýran.
I am now.	Men häzir.
I can't go there	Men ol ýere baryp bilemok
He did it right away.	Ol derrew etdi.
It wasn't good, but it wasn't bad.	Gowy däldi, ýöne beýle erbet däldi.
He knew something was going to happen to him.	Özüne bir zadyň boljakdygyny bilýärdi.
This will not be possible.	Bu gaty mümkin bolmaz.
Like me, once.	Meniň ýaly, bir gezek.
This was not possible.	Bu mümkin däldi.
There is so much to do.	Ol ýerde gaty köp zat bar.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
This is really it.	Bu hakykatdanam.
This is great for me.	Meniň üçin bu ajaýyp.
He hadn't thought about it for years.	Birnäçe ýyl bäri ol hakda pikir etmedi.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
Not yet tomorrow.	Ertir entek ýok.
Tomorrow was a weekend.	Ertir dynç güni boldy.
He gave it to her.	Ol ony berdi.
There seems to be a reason for the damage.	Zyýan bermek üçin bir sebäp gerek ýaly.
He will come.	Ol geler.
Now everyone does.	Indi hemmeler edýär.
Because now there is nothing.	Sebäbi indi hiç zadyň özi ýok.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
He was no one.	Ol hiç kim däldi.
Now it happens.	Indi bu bolýar.
He does the same.	Ol hem edil şonuň ýaly edýär.
She wants to be alone.	Ol ýeke bolmak isleýär.
I had such an idea about you.	Sen hakda şeýle pikir bardy.
This is not true and it is not.	Bu dogry däl we dogry däl.
I'm not the right person.	Men hakykatdanam dogry adam däl.
I won't need it again.	Maňa ýene gerek bolmaz.
Tell us what happened.	Näme bolandygyny bize aýdyň.
In fact, it is more.	Aslynda, bu has köp.
To be honest.	Dogry aýtmak üçin.
If it is not, it is not.	Ol ýok bolsa, beýle däl.
Maybe this summer.	Belki şu tomus.
She is a girl.	Ol bir gyz.
Who really knows, but he does.	Kim hakykatdanam bilýär, ýöne özi.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
Not a bad person.	Erbet adam däl.
No one did that.	Hiç kim muny etmedi.
That's exactly what happened.	Ol hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
Everything is too much.	Hemme zat gaty köp.
Maybe a new life.	Mümkin täze durmuş.
There is more.	Has köp zat bar.
That's all you have to do.	Bu diňe seniň zadyň.
Impossible, but possible.	Mümkin däl, ýöne mümkin.
Of course.	Elbetde.
I care about you.	Men saňa alada edýärin.
Not much.	Kän däl.
There are three ways.	Üç ýol bar.
It made me a better person.	Bu meni has gowy adam etdi.
The time was short.	Wagty gysga boldy.
I've seen a lot.	Men gaty köp gördüm.
It's not that smart.	Bu beýle akylly däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, şu hakda.
This is a very bad idea.	Bu gaty erbet pikir.
No answer	Jogap ýok
It's a beautiful thing.	Ajaýyp owadan zat.
This is a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk.
I didn't think about it.	Men bu hakda hiç zat pikir etmedim.
I can love you	Men seni gowy görüp bilýärin.
I do this to make it interesting.	Men muny gyzykly etmek üçin edýärin.
Me, never.	Men, hiç haçan ýok.
Just worry and worry.	Diňe alada we alada.
Of course, this is not the only case.	Elbetde bu ýeke-täk däl.
I can't tell you anything else.	Indi saňa başga zat aýdyp biljek däl.
I am completely new.	Men düýbünden täze.
No one could answer us.	Hiç kim bize jogap berip bilmedi.
Here or there.	Bu ýerde ýa-da ol ýerde.
I can't be that smart.	Men beýle akylly bolup bilemok.
I don't do that.	Men beýle zat etmeýärin.
Even for every song.	Hatda her aýdym üçin.
Okay.	Bolýar.
It's very difficult.	Gaty kyn.
Doing a lot of things there.	Ol ýerde köp zatlar etmek.
That was not enough.	Bu gaty bir ýeterlik däldi.
It can't take that.	Bu muny alyp bilmez.
It could be that.	Bu hem bolup biler.
He did something.	Bir zat etdi.
That made it even more interesting.	Bu bolsa has gyzykly etdi.
It was just like that.	Bu edil ýalydy.
It was a little strange.	Biraz geň ýalydy.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
He has already borrowed.	Ol eýýäm karz aldy.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
It seemed really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy ýalydy.
Maybe not.	Belki bolmaz.
What's the big deal?	Uly mesele näme.
He did not know what it was like.	Ol munuň nähili bolandygyny bilmeýärdi.
He could not see her anywhere.	Ol ony hiç ýerde görüp bilmedi.
Of course you can do more.	Elbetde has köp zat edip bilersiňiz.
No need to go any further.	Mundan beýläk gitmek hökman däl.
I saw it happen.	Men munuň bolandygyny gördüm.
Enough now.	Häzirki wagtda ýeterlik.
He took it twice.	Iki gezek aldy.

Every day is new.	Her gün täze.
Always there.	Elmydama şol ýerde.
He is still good.	Ol henizem gowy.
Tell the truth.	Hakykaty aýdyň.
No longer thinking about it.	Indi bu hakda pikir etmeýär.
This is not what you need at all.	Bu size düýbünden zerur zat däl.
This idea seems right to me.	Bu pikir maňa dogry bolup görünýär.
I know it exists.	Men onuň bardygyny bilýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, onuň işi bardy.
It's bad for you.	Ol siziň üçin erbet.
There can be no one.	Bir adam bolup bilmez.
I think that's great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu gaty uly.
I'm sorry about something else.	Başga bir zat hakda gynanýaryn.
You can worry about that later.	Bu barada soň alada edip bilersiňiz.
It will destroy everything.	Bu hemme zady ýok eder.
It's very easy to do that.	Muny etmek gaty aňsat.
.	.
Then there was not much sun.	Soň gün kän däldi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there. "	Ol beýle däl "-diýdi.
I am not alone.	Men ýeke däl.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
I have never seen such a thing.	Men beýle zady görmedim.

Nowhere else.	Başga hiç ýerde däl.
We can't help it.	Biz oňa kömek edip bilmeris.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu hakda hiç zat ýok.
You know one thing.	Bir zady bilýärsiň.
She had to go home.	Öýüne gitmeli boldy.
He will too.	Ol hem eder.
I'm not good enough.	Men oňa ýeterlik däl.
There was an opportunity like that.	Başga zatlar ýaly bir mümkinçilik bardy.
He did not object.	Muňa garşy däldi.
It's about something else.	Bu başga bir zat hakda.
This is for him.	Bu onuň üçin.
He didn't have to go anywhere.	Hiç ýere gitmeli däldi.
That was not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däldi.
There is really no question.	Hakykatdanam hiç hili sorag ýok.

I allowed that.	Men muňa ýol berdim.
Now will be the time.	Indi wagt bolar.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Hakykatdanam doly bolmak üçin umyt bolmaly.
It's better to go home.	Öýe gitmek has gowy.
Then he returned to her.	Soň bolsa oňa gaýdyp geldi.
Neither was.	Ikisi-de ýokdy.
Not many people can do that.	Köp adam muny edip bilmez.
It was not for them.	Bu olar üçin däldi.
He returned to work immediately.	Derrew işe gaýdyp geldi.
No problem here.	Bu ýerde mesele ýok.
Of course, he was alone.	Elbetde, ol ýeke boldy.
There were two votes.	Iki ses boldy.
He knew he had to do something fast.	Çalt bir zat etmelidigini bilýärdi.
That would be really nice.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy bolardy.
It's too early to tell how bad it will be.	Munuň nähili erbet boljakdygyny aýtmak üçin entek ir.

This is not for me.	Bu, meniň üçin ýok.
Nothing was good.	Hiç zat gowy däldi.

It seems like a lot has happened since yesterday.	Düýn bäri köp zat bolup geçen ýalydy.

This is also a lie.	Bu hem ýalan.
There will be no such opportunity anymore.	Mundan beýläk beýle mümkinçilik bolmaz.
Maybe he didn't want to.	Belki, ol islemedi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bütin hakykaty şeýle.
Maybe you can give me some tips.	Belki, maňa birnäçe maslahat berip bilersiňiz.
The day has come.	Gün geldi.

And then he agreed.	Soň bolsa, muňa razy boldy.
You can do this in two ways.	Bu ýerde iki ýol bilen edip bilersiňiz.
He asked himself there.	Ol özüni şol ýerde sorady.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe etmeli.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
He didn't even pay attention.	Ol hatda üns bermedi.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.

This can be both good and bad.	Bu hem gowy, hem erbet zat bolup biler.

So he did it all very well.	Şonuň üçin hemmesini gaty gowy etdi.
I don't want to be that guy.	Men ol ýigit bolmak islämok.
You have to give him some time.	Oňa biraz wagt bermeli.
It's been a long week.	Uzak bir hepde boldy.

You have to go for help.	Kömek üçin gitmeli.
Good here	Bu ýerde gowy.

The voice said.	Ses aýtdy.
You know he can.	Biljekdigini bilýärsiň.
He didn’t want anything and anything else.	Islän zady we başga zat islemedi.
He can't do anything else.	Başga zat edip bilmez.
I was with him.	Men onuň bilen boldum.
We didn't need to.	Bize gerek däldi.
Life was good for them.	Durmuş olar üçin gowy boldy.
It was not easy to go.	Gitmek aňsat däldi.
She has been thinking about it all day, all week.	Ol bu barada bütin gün, bütin hepde pikir edip gelýär.
A lot of trouble.	Köp kynçylyk.
That was not the case before.	Öň beýle däldi.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
He wants more.	Ol has köp zady isleýär.
A girl who is ready to do anything.	Her zady etmäge taýyn gyz.
This is really interesting.	Bu hakykatdanam gyzykly.
Not necessarily here.	Bu ýerde hökman däl.
It never seems to be enough.	Hiç haçan ýeterlik däl ýaly.
No one could.	Hiç kim edip bilmedi.
No one thought it would happen.	Munuň boljakdygyny hiç kim pikir etmedi.
He did something.	Ol bir zatlar etdi.
They are often not.	Olar köplenç beýle däl.
I had to destroy it.	Men ýok etmeli boldum.
He didn't have to say that.	Ol muny aýtmaly däldi.
What are you?!.	Sen näme?!.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Bu karar wagty.
Of course it was a very good answer.	Elbetde, gaty gowy jogap boldy.
I hope this helps.	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
She enjoyed it.	Ol lezzet aldy.
I'll do it tomorrow.	Ertir etjek.
Can't help it anymore.	Indi kömek edip bolmaz.
I don't like to think about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etmegi halamok.
He did it again.	Ol muny ýene etdi.
There is plenty of time for those things.	Şol zatlar üçin köp wagt bar.
A long way to go.	Hakykatdanam uzak ýol.
It was like something new.	Täze bir zat ýalydy.
You have to admit that.	Muny boýun almaly.
No one.	Hiç kim ýok.
That should not be the case.	Bu beýle bolmaly däldi.
I made a lot of mistakes.	Köp ýalňyşlyk aldym.
He looked like a good guy.	Ol gowy ýigit ýalydy.
I do not know	Men bilemok
I had to go home.	Men öýe gitmeli boldum.
What with one thing and another.	Bir zat we başga zat bilen näme.
Definitely hard.	Elbetde kyn.
Of course, there was enough money.	Elbetde, ýeterlik pul bardy.
Maybe to you.	Belki size.
There was nothing else that could have happened.	Başga bolup biljek başga zat ýokdy.
If so, you should pay attention.	Şeýle bolsa, üns bermeli.
It was bad.	Bu erbet boldy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, zerur däl zat.
More interesting.	Has gyzykly.
I'm sorry	Bagyşlaň
He once did something there.	Ol bir gezek ol ýerde bir iş etdi.
OK, let's go.	Bolýar, gitmeli.
There seems to be more hope here.	Bu ýerde has köp umyt bar ýaly.
I never knew.	Men asla bilmedim.
It was really nice to see him.	Ony görmek hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
I don't like it.	Men ony halamok.
This is not really the case.	Hakykatdanam beýle bolmaz.
Everything will be fine now.	Häzir hemme zat gowy bolar.
There must be something else.	Başga zat bolmaly.
I had a summer vacation.	Tomus dynç aldym.
Now.	Indi.
Very good now.	Häzir gaty gowy.
Can anyone help me?	Maňa kömek edip biljek barmy?
So it stayed in one place.	Şonuň üçin bu bir ýerde galdy.
One person answered.	Bir adam jogap berdi.
Someone else would have to do it.	Başga biri etmeli bolardy.
This message already exists.	Bu habar eýýäm bar.
It won't be long.	Uzak bolmaz.
Nothing will be easy.	Hiç zat aňsat bolmaz.
She thought she was a beautiful girl.	Bir owadan gyz diýip pikir etdi.
It should be.	Ol bolmaly.
Okay.	Bolýar.
I find it difficult now.	Men indi muny kyn gördüm.
He was crazy to do that.	Ol muny etmek üçin däli boldy.
I have them.	Olar mende bar.
I don't know anything.	Men hiç zat hakda bilemok.
He immediately agreed.	Ol derrew razy boldy.
Everyone had a great time last year.	Geçen ýyl hemmeler gaty hezil etdi.
It could be a sound.	Bu ses bolup biler.
In fact, there are many.	Aslynda gaty köp.
He was alone.	Ol ýeke boldy.
Not a bad life.	Erbet durmuş däl.
It will not happen again.	Indi beýle bolmaz.
Who can get it now.	Indi kim alyp biler.
Interesting to know.	Bilmek gyzykly.
Then I had something.	Soň mende bir zat boldy.
He has nothing else to tell you.	Ol saňa aýdyp biljek başga zat däl.
It's never too early to do that.	Muny etmek hiç wagt ir däl.
The damage is so bad.	Zyýan şeýle erbet.
This is exactly what happened.	Bu, elbetde, şeýle boldy.
And then you have to go and sing for us.	Soň bolsa gidip, biziň üçin aýdym aýtmaly.
Of course that's right.	Elbetde dogry zat.
He came to the very ground.	Ol gaty ýere geldi.
If you have to do something, do it now.	Bir zat etmeli bolsa, indi et.
It's very easy to do.	Ony etmek gaty aňsat.
Another call came.	Başga jaň geldi.
Anyone can do that.	Her kim muny edip biler.
I didn't want anything else.	Men başga zat islemedim.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
Tomorrow may be a good day for that.	Ertir munuň üçin gowy gün bolup biler.

It's good there.	Ol ýerde gowy.

You know very well that he exists.	Onuň bardygyny gaty gowy bilýärsiň.
He took the day.	Güni aldy.
It will be something else.	Bu başga bir zat bolar.
This is a lie.	Bu ýalan.
He seems to know today.	Ol şu gün bilýän ýaly.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, edil şonuň ýaly.
I just let him do what he wanted to do.	Diňe oňa etjek zadyny etmäge rugsat berdim.
Someone close.	Kimdir biri ýakyn.
It seemed like a lot right now.	Häzirki wagtda gaty köp ýalydy.
And then the next and the next.	Soň bolsa indiki we indiki.
This is really cool.	Bu hakykatdanam ajaýyp.
That's it.	Boldy.
I have so much fun this time.	Men bu gezek gaty hezil.
He asked me.	Ol menden haýyş etdi.
This is still great.	Bu henizem ajaýyp.
He did not immediately respond.	Ol derrew jogap bermedi.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu olar üçin iş.
It happened to me.	Bu meniň bilen boldy.
This is not the case.	Bu ýok.
I am for this.	Men munuň üçin.
This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
He will help us.	Ol bize kömek eder.
Then the police arrived.	Soň polisiýa geldi.
I can't say enough good things about him.	Men ol hakda ýeterlik gowy zatlar aýdyp biljek däl.
Everyone had something to say about themselves.	Her kimiň özi hakda aýdyp biljek bir zady bardy.
No one can see us.	Hiç kim bizi görüp bilmez.
It's also easy and fast to do.	Şeýle hem etmek aňsat we çalt.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hakykatdanam etmeli zat.
I said yesterday.	Düýn aýtdym.
This is often not the case.	Bu, köplenç mesele däl.
You just have to go	Diňe gitmeli
This is crazy.	Bu däli.
He was crazy for her.	Ol onuň üçin däli boldy.
I have to go tonight.	Şu gije gitmeli.
He wanted me.	Ol meni isledi.
In fact, I didn't think so.	Aslynda beýle eder öýdemokdym.
Of course.	Elbetde.
There was no way to do that.	Munuň üçin mümkinçilik ýokdy.
The book, maybe.	Kitap, belki.
He was not there yet.	Ol henizem ýokdy.
I think it's great.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol ajaýyp.
Everyone.	Her kim.
He was there to help.	Ol kömek etmek üçin bardy.

If only he knew.	Diňe bilýän bolsa.
He could not go home.	Öýüne baryp bilmedi.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
Why?	Näme üçin?
They are not there at all.	Olar düýbünden ýok.
I bought it for him	Men oňa satyn aldym
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
I have to go home now.	Men indi öýe gitmeli.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, edil şonuň ýaly.
I just got one.	Men diňe bir zady aldym.
The good news is, that's it.	Gowy habar, şeýle bolýar.

Strange, but it was.	Geň görünýär, ýöne şeýle boldy.
Of course, everyone will do something about it.	Elbetde, her kim munuň bilen bir zatlar eder.
He did well.	Gowy etdi.
Maybe he can come back.	Belki, gaýdyp biler.
Of course I didn't.	Elbetde, etmedim.
Now it was almost time for him to leave.	Indi onuň gitmeli wagty diýen ýalydy.
It's just money.	Bu diňe pul.
I thought so.	Men şeýle pikir etdim.
Now that is strange.	Indi bu geň.
It looks great.	Gaty gowy görünýär.
Oh, something else.	Aý, başga bir zat.
Maybe it can't be.	Belki, ol bolup bilmez.
And work.	We iş.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
There is no question to answer.	Jogap bermek üçin sorag ýok.
There was no one else who could help.	Kömek edip biljek başga adam ýokdy.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
She is a good girl.	Ol gowy gyz.
Faster to avoid unnecessary.	Gerek däl bolmak üçin has çalt.
I was not that stupid.	Men beýle samsyk däldim.
"Everything seemed good," he said.	Ol: "Hemme zat gowy ýalydy" -diýdi.
It will not be so difficult for us.	Bu biziň üçin beýle kyn bolmaz.
Just to make you happy.	Diňe sizi bagtly etmek üçin.
Of course he did.	Elbetde etdi.
It's like you.	Bu, seniň ýaly.
That's it.	Biz şol.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu, olar üçin jogap bermeli zat.
More interesting.	Has gyzykly.
He is a very young man.	Ol gaty ýigit.
Then came the sound.	Soň ses geldi.
This was a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk boldy.
Of course, that was no longer the case.	Elbetde, bu indi dogry däldi.
There is something strange here.	Bu ýerde bir geň zat bar.
You are too big	Sen gaty uly
His presence was short-lived.	Onuň bolmagy gysga boldy.
Not much else.	Başga kän zat ýok.
Appeared everywhere.	Hemme ýerde görünýär.
For me.	Meniň üçin.
Maybe something else.	Belki başga bir zat bolup biler.
I don't like it very much	Men muny gaty halamok
Not good.	Gowy däl.
I had nothing.	Mende hiç zat ýokdy.
It took a long time to do that.	Muny etmek üçin köp wagt gerek boldy.
There will be three.	Üç bolar.
Really good evening.	Hakykatdanam gowy agşam.
There is hope.	Umyt bar.
He now calls me every day.	Ol indi her gün maňa jaň edýär.
Nothing happened.	Hiç zat bile däldi.
If this is large.	Bu uly bolsa.
It was impossible to do that.	Muny etmek mümkin däldi.
It will be easy.	Bu aňsat bolar.
He apologized again.	Ol ýene ötünç sorady.
He didn't have time for that.	Onuň beýle zat üçin wagty ýokdy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle bolmaz.
Because it is very difficult.	Sebäbi bu gaty kyn.
It will be.	Ol bolar.
And we.	We biz.
Great guy	Ajaýyp ýigit.
Which is the problem.	Mesele haýsy.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
I offer another life.	Başga durmuş teklip edýärin.
No one wanted that.	Hiç kim muny islemedi.
It's too big.	Bu gaty uly.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
It should be good !.	Gowy bolmaly!.
I never did.	Hiç haçan etmedim.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
This is what happens.	Bu şeýle bolýar.
This is the first issue.	Bu ilkinji mesele.
I have nothing wrong.	Mende hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
I can do that	Men muny edip bilýärin
I never do that.	Men muny hiç haçan etmeýärin.
I can get it again.	Men ýene alyp bilerin.
You can do everything right.	Hemme zady dogry edip bilersiňiz.
You really have to do it.	Hakykatdanam etmeli.
He must have informed me.	Ol hökman maňa habar berdi.
'.	'.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ine, gyzykly zat.
And now he didn't pay attention.	Indi bolsa oňa üns bermedi.
He was crazy.	Ol däli boldy.
I'm so scared.	Men şeýle gorkýaryn.
Not two, one.	Iki däl, bir.
It's been a long night.	Gije köp boldy.
There seemed to be a number of reasons.	Birnäçe sebäp bar ýalydy.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu onuň zady.
This will be very worrying.	Bu gaty biynjalyk bolar.
Not two.	Iki däl.
There was no life here.	Bu ýerde durmuş ýokdy.
Not everyone can do this.	Bu işi hemmeler edip bilmez.
This has been the case for years.	Bu birnäçe ýyl bäri.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
It doesn't have to be that serious.	Bu çynlakaý bir zat bolmaly däl.
It was bad.	Bu erbet boldy.
No one could speak.	Hiç kim gürläp bilmedi.
It's over.	Soň boldy.
It could be two weeks.	Iki hepde bolup biler.
Of course he knows this is not the case.	Munuň beýle däldigini elbetde biler.
Couldn't be long.	Uzak bolup bilmedi.
For this.	Munuň üçin.
No advice, no work.	Maslahat ýok, iş ýok.
Nothing for them.	Olar üçin hiç zat ýok.
He wanted to call.	Jaň etmegini isledi.
He wasn’t just bad.	Ol diňe bir erbet däldi.
Don't do that anymore.	Indi etmeli däl.
He did not want to see.	Ol görmek islemedi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
There is no one there.	Ol ýerde hiç kim ýok.
For the first time, the two were alone.	Ilkinji gezek ikisi ýeke boldy.
It took two hours.	Iki sagat gerek boldy.
He is not.	Ol ýok.
This is life.	Bu durmuş.
Of course it comes.	Elbetde gelýär.
You have to do better.	Has gowy etmeli.
This is not a big deal.	Bu gaty uly mesele däl.
Everything seemed possible.	Hemme zat mümkin ýalydy.
Almost one or two people.	Bir ýa-da iki adam diýen ýaly.
I think he is right.	Meniň pikirimçe, ol dogry aýdýar.
This is not a close issue.	Bu ýakyn mesele däl.
Three hours.	Üç sagat.
You are so beautiful	Sen gaty owadan.
He was always there.	Elmydama bardy.
I still have a problem.	Mende henizem bir mesele bar.
I was worried about you.	Men saňa uly alada etdim.
Everything is right.	Hemme zat dogry.
This is not surprising at all.	Bu asla geň däl.
That sounds really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy ýaly.
No one wants to be here.	Hiç kim bu ýerde bolmak islemeýär.
I don't care.	Men alada etmeýärin.
He thought faster.	Ol has çalt pikir etdi.
It's not bad to take a long time.	Uzak wagt almak erbet däl.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
Well, this time it's not about you.	Näme, bu gezek sen hakda däl.
I thought it would be good.	Bu gowy bolar öýdüpdim.
I have a quick question.	Mende çalt sorag bar.
You always need	Size hemişe zerur.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Hakykatdanam sen munuň sebäbi.
This is not the right word.	Bu dogry söz däl.
This is who we are.	Bu biz kim.
He is not.	Ol ýok.
Maybe he's fine with me.	Belki, ol meniň bilen gowy.
He had something to do tonight.	Onuň şu gije etmeli zatlary bardy.
You can be completely crazy.	Siz düýbünden däli bolup bilersiňiz.
I hope someone here can help me.	Bu ýerde kimdir biri maňa kömek edip biler diýip umyt edýärin.
He never harmed anyone.	Ol hiç haçan hiç kime zyýan bermedi.
This is no longer the case.	Bu indi däl.
This will not happen.	Bu bolmaz.
This is a concern.	Bu alada.
He could not speak.	Ol gürläp bilmedi.
Everything looks good on him.	Hemme zat oňa gowy görünýär.
Is there a case for this?	Bu mesele üçin bir iş barmy?
It was too much.	Bu gaty köp boldy.
It was nothing.	Bu hiç zat däldi.
Good, good man.	Gowy, gowy adam.
In fact, there is someone.	Aslynda kimdir biri bar.
It's been a while.	Biraz wagt boldy.
She was amazed.	Oňa haýran galdy.
Two hours left.	Iki sagat galdy.
I can't think of a better person than you.	Men senden gowy adam hakda pikir edip bilemok.
I know that.	Men muny bilýärin.
We are not ready for that now.	Biz häzir muňa taýyn däl.
I wondered what could be done.	Näme edip boljakdygyny pikir etdim.
Maybe he can get it next year.	Belki indiki ýyl ony alyp biler.
They are good.	Olar gowy.
He seemed very close to her.	Oňa gaty ýakyn ýalydy.
It was not a bad word.	Erbet söz däldi.
You are better off with us here.	Sen bu ýerde biziň bilen has gowy.
He is not stupid.	Ol samsyk däl.
OK, we can't.	Bolýar, edip bilmeris.
We can't vote.	Ses berip bilmeris.
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
Maybe he needs something.	Belki, oňa gerek zat bolsa gerek.
That was all there was to it and nothing else.	Diňe şu bardy we başga hiç zat ýokdy.
I'm very new to this.	Men muňa gaty täze.
Not only bad, but not very good.	Diňe erbet däl, ýöne gaty gowy däl.
To really do that.	Hakykatdanam muny etmek üçin.
He is with us now.	Ol häzir biziň bilen.
I'll call in the morning.	Irden jaň ederin.
I care about them.	Men olar hakda alada edýärin.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
He has to.	Ol etmeli.
This is for them.	Bu olar üçin.
I've been there for a while.	Men ol ýerde birnäçe wagt boldum.
It seems impossible.	Mümkin däl ýaly.
I did not see.	Görmedim.
It just looks right.	Diňe dogry görünýär.
Oh, the last thing.	Aý, iň soňky zat.
With some work.	Bir hili iş bilen.
It's not really about him.	Bu hakykatdanam ol hakda däl.
I said he could take it for a while.	Biraz wagt alyp biljekdigini aýtdym.
I am no more	Men indi däl
He thought it was too late.	Gijä galdy diýip pikir etdi.
There is no other way.	Başga ýol ýok.
No one needed it.	Hiç kime zerur däldi.
I think I know.	Bilýän öýdýän.
I could no longer be a police officer.	Men indi polisiýa bolup bilmedim.
There was a young man.	Bir ýigit bardy.
More is possible.	Has köp zat mümkin.
Lending is hard.	Karz bermek kyn.
You can too.	Siz hem bolup bilersiňiz.
He never said anything about it.	Hiç haçan bu barada hiç zat aýtmady.
It helped a little.	Biraz kömek etdi.
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
Of course very fast.	Elbetde gaty çalt.
Maybe it wasn't enough to be worried.	Belki, biynjalyk bolmak ýeterlik däldi.
So there is nothing wrong with that.	Şonuň üçin hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýok.
This question has not been asked before.	Bu sorag öňem däldi.
Of course, you are not alone.	Elbetde, size diňe habar däl.
I am happy for him.	Men onuň üçin bagtly.
I thought about it all night.	Men bu hakda bütin gije pikir etdim.
Maybe even.	Mümkin, hatda.
He stayed home.	Ol öýde galdy.
I thought this was an idea.	Bu pikir diýip pikir etdim.
They are crazy.	Olar däli.
It was not difficult.	Bu gaty kyn däldi.
This is strange to me.	Bu meniň üçin geň.
That was the problem.	Bu mesele boldy.
I have no choice.	Mende başga ýol ýok.
To me	Maňa.
He didn't really want to leave.	Ol hakykatdanam gitmek islemedi.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
And then he left.	Soň bolsa gitdi.
How can I go about it?	Bu barada nädip gidip bilerin?
That's a good idea.	Bu barada gaty gowy pikir.
In addition.	Mundan başga.
We can get each.	Her birini alyp bileris.
Nothing good happened.	Gowy zat ýokdy.
He understood her.	Ol oňa düşündi.
I thought about it almost every day.	Bu hakda her gün diýen ýaly pikir etdim.
Not pretty either.	Şeýle hem owadan däl.
I could love it so much.	Men ony gaty gowy görüp bilýärdim.
I must have been surprised.	Men geň gören bolmaly.
He asked me why this was not the case.	Ol menden näme üçin beýle däldigini sorady.
The man who asked her to help him.	Oňa kömek etmegini haýyş eden adam.
! 	!
There was nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýokdy.
It looks like this now.	Häzir şeýle görünýär.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu dogry boldy.
Why would anyone do that?	Näme üçin her kim beýle eder?
I think we can see that every day.	Muny her gün görüp bileris diýip pikir edýärin.
What is this really?	Bu hakykatdanam näme.
He did.	Ol etdi.
Knowing this.	Muny bilmek.
It's been a long time coming.	Uzak wagt boldy.
I didn't see you there.	Men seni ol ýerde görmedim.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däldi.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I'm sorry and I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň we gynanýaryn.
Something went wrong this week.	Bu hepde ýalňyşlyk boldy.
The case is back.	Iş gaýdyp geldi.
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Bu mesele bolsa gerek.
Then he started himself.	Soň özüni başlady.
Okay, not often.	Bolýar, köplenç däl.
We need it	Bize gerek
You can go home.	Öýe gidip bilersiňiz.
They are just beautiful.	Olar diňe owadan.
Of course.	Elbetde.
There must be someone else.	Başga biri bolmaly.
There was no concern here.	Bu ýerde hiç hili alada ýokdy.
I think this will be great.	Bu ajaýyp bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
What do you think is needed?	Siziň pikiriňizçe näme gerek?
You will have to give a lot of time.	Köp wagt bermeli bolarsyňyz.
They are very easy to go.	Olar gitmek gaty aňsat.
That's how it went.	Ol edil şonuň ýaly gitdi.
There were only two people in the house.	Öýde diňe iki adam bardy.
He can borrow for it.	Munuň üçin karz alyp biler.
It can't be.	Ol bolup bilmez.
No harm done.	Zyýan ýok.
How wonderful life is.	Durmuş nähili ajaýyp.
In the right place.	Dogry ýerde.
Who are you 	Sen kim?
He wanted to see her.	Ony görmek isledi.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
I don't want money	Men pul islämok
He was absolutely right.	Ol düýbünden dogry aýtdy.
Of course, this is not enough.	Elbetde, bu ýeterlik däl.
That day was over.	Ol gün boldy.
I am happy for him.	Men onuň üçin bagtly.
That's all there is to it.	Bu ýerde bar zat.
This has always been the case and always should be.	Elmydama şeýle boldy we hemişe bolmaly.
It's been a tough year all year.	Ol indi bütin ýyl gaty kyn boldy.
I never saw him there.	Men ol ýerde hiç wagt görmedim.
He is right.	Ol dogry edýär.
This is not wonderful.	Bu ajaýyp däl.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
Definitely a lot.	Elbetde köp.
Then he understood me.	Soň maňa düşündi.
I took some time to be alone with him.	Men onuň bilen ýeke bolmak üçin biraz wagt aldym.
He said he could not do that.	Muny edip bilmejekdigini aýtdy.
Often young things.	Köplenç ýaş zatlar.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
He was not alone.	Ol ýeke däldi.
No job, no money, no debt.	Iş ýok, pul ýok, karz ýok.
Maybe not for you.	Belki size däl.
He cared about things for me.	Meniň üçin zatlar hakda alada etdi.
I can't really tell when this will happen.	Munuň haçan boljakdygyny hakykatdanam aýdyp biljek däl.
Because no one is you.	Sebäbi hiç kim sen däl.
Not really that bad.	Aslynda gaty erbet däl.
It was hard.	Ol kyn boldy.
I care every day, every day.	Her gün, her gün alada edýärin.
I was not good enough.	Men ýeterlik däldim.
It looks worse.	Has erbet görünýär.
He had a lot of time.	Onuň köp wagty bardy.
All he can think of is himself.	Onuň pikir edip biljek zady onuň özi.
I thought it would be a book.	Kitap bolar öýdüpdim.
This is not an easy task.	Bu aňsat iş däl.
It's too late.	Ol köp gijä galdy.
He is not really human.	Ol hakykatdanam adam däl.
This is us.	Bu biz.
He was no one.	Ol hiç kim däldi.
I don't want to do that	Men muny etmek islämok
Nothing for me here.	Bu ýerde meniň üçin hiç zat ýok.
That's all for us.	Bu biziň üçin hemme zat.
Knowing this is not his job.	Muny bilmek onuň işi däl.
Must admit.	Boýun almaly.
Of course you have to go one day.	Elbetde, bir gün gitmeli.
Now it's possible.	Indi mümkin.
He was the last to do so.	Ol muny iň soňky etjek boldy.
I didn’t want to make him crazy.	Men ony däli etmek islemedim.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu dogry däl ýaly.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Agree with him.	Onuň bilen razy.
This is not what he did to her.	Bu onuň oňa eden zady däl.
Bad for a long time.	Uzak wagt bäri erbet.
Now tell me.	Indi aýdyň.
You have to worry more.	Has köp alada etmeli.
I hope this helps!	Bu kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin!
No one is good or bad at all.	Hiç kim düýbünden gowy ýa-da erbet däl.
She thought she was beautiful.	Ol owadan diýip pikir etdi.
I don't want to talk about it anymore.	Bu hakda mundan beýläk gürleşmek islämok.
To be like him.	Onuň ýaly bolmak.
No one can answer us.	Hiç kim bize jogap berip bilmez.
I'll take care of it right away.	Men derrew bu barada alada ederin.
The girl says she can sing.	Gyz aýdym aýdyp biljekdigini aýdýar.
Nothing was too difficult for them.	Hiç zat olar üçin gaty kyn däldi.
It can be really good.	Ol hakykatdanam gowy bolup biler.
This was not the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek däldi.
I'll be fine.	Men özüm gowy bolaryn.
It's not time.	Ol wagt däl.
So no one should be harmed.	Şonuň üçin hiç kime zyýan bermeli däl.
He is not.	Ol beýle däl.
I didn't have to do that.	Men muny etmeli däldim.
I believe that.	Men muňa ynanýaryn.
This is something completely different.	Bu düýbünden başga zat.
So I thought about it.	Şonuň üçin bir pikir etdim.
A little here.	Bu ýerde birneme.
He is never here when he needs it.	Gerek wagty hiç wagt bu ýerde däl.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
There are other things.	Başga zatlar hem bar.
I am against it.	Men muňa garşy.
It may take several hours.	Birnäçe sagat gerek bolup biler.
He does that to me.	Ol maňa şeýle edýär.
And other things.	We başga zatlar.
I don't think so.	Meniň pikirimçe, beýle bolmaly däl.
One day we can really go there.	Bir gün hakykatdanam ol ýere gidip bileris.
He thought so.	Ol şeýle bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
I hope you are happy.	Bagtly bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin.
He didn't have to worry about anything.	Hiç zat hakda alada etmeli däldi.
I don't have it.	Ol mende ýok.
What a bad word.	Bu nähili erbet söz.
Here we are.	Ine, biz şol ýerde.
You have to do that	Muny etmeli
In fact, it is not.	Aslynda beýle zerur däl.
He did nothing.	Ol hiç zat etmedi.
Nothing will ever happen.	Hiç haçan hiç zat bolmaz.
You are not enough for me	Sen meniň üçin ýeterlik däl
I can't do it today	Men şu gün edip bilemok
I can sing about it.	Bu hakda aýdym aýdyp bilerin.
The sooner the better.	Näçe ir bolsa gowy.
We can go with them.	Olar bilen baryp bileris.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
The girl quickly agreed.	Gyz çalt razy boldy.
No one else wants that.	Muny başga hiç kim islemeýär.
I hope this is the right thing for her.	Bu onuň üçin dogry zat diýip umyt edýärin.
I need them.	Olar maňa gerek.
The right message for the right thing to do.	Dogry iş üçin dogry habar.
I can do it now.	Men indi edip bilerin.
It won't happen anymore.	Indi bolmaz.
Something wonderful and wonderful.	Ajaýyp we ajaýyp bir zat.
There was more.	Has köp zat bardy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
This is worse for me.	Meniň üçin bu has erbet.
This is very worrying.	Bu gaty biynjalyk.
The man had to leave.	Ol adam gitmeli boldy.
Maybe it will help him.	Belki, oňa kömek eder.
Absolutely wonderful.	Elbetde ajaýyp.
If it's bad, it can't help it.	Erbet bolsa, oňa kömek edip bilmez.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
These things cannot make us a better person.	Bu zatlar bizi has gowy adam edip bilmez.
There is nothing against it.	Oňa garşy hiç zat ýok.
For many people.	Köp adam üçin.
You and I are one.	Sen we men bir.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
The girl is crazy.	Gyz däli.
Not time.	Wagt däl.
I will never have anything for you.	Men hiç haçan seniň üçin hiç zat bolmaz.
Good news.	Gowy habar.
She was very worried.	Ol gaty alada galdy.
He will do well here.	Ol bu ýerde gowy eder.
I thought about it a lot.	Men bu barada köp pikir etdim.
And then every month.	Soň bolsa her aý.
It should be the same.	Şeýle hem bolmaly.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
It will be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolar.
They may have already done so.	Olar eýýäm şeýle eden bolmagy mümkin.
Here it is for you	Ine, siziň üçin
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
I have nothing else to do.	Başga etjek zadym ýok.
Of course not.	Elbetde bolmaz.
He didn't think so.	Ol beýle däldi, diýip pikir etdi.
Why not?	Näme üçin beýle däl?
They don't need you.	Olar saňa mätäç däl.
This is not a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk däl.
Maybe it would be better.	Belki has gowy bolardy.
The moon and something else.	Aý we başga bir zat.
This is not difficult at all.	Bu asla kyn däl.
That's right- this is not about me.	Dogry, bu ýalan.
I want to talk to him.	Men onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
He thought he must have seen it somewhere.	Ol muny bir ýerde gören bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
He seemed to have a bigger problem here.	Bu ýerde oňa has uly mesele bar ýalydy.
He didn't think so either.	Ol hem pikir etmedi.
No more debt.	Karz indi ýok.
This worries me.	Bu meni biynjalyk edýär.
This is good.	Bu gowy.
I am very difficult.	Men gaty kyn.
I thought it was really good.	Men hakykatdanam gowy diýip pikir etdim.
Here's what.	Ine, näme.
The moon should not be like that.	Aý beýle bolmaly däl.
There was more.	Has köp zat bardy.
It shouldn't be bad.	Erbet bolmaly däl.
This is good news.	Bu gowy habar.
That was not the case before.	Ozal beýle däldi.
And then the next and the next.	Soň bolsa indiki we indiki.
Great for both of us.	Ikimiz üçin ajaýyp.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däl.
Oh, that's true in many places.	Aý, bu köp ýerde dogry.
It will be next.	Indiki bolar.
I'm very bad.	Men gaty erbet.
He would have to go too.	Ol hem gitmeli bolardy.

He thought there was more to it.	Bu ýerde has köp zat bolmaly diýip pikir etdi.
Many	Köp.
I will do it.	Men muny ederin.
Such a good guy	Şeýle gowy ýigit.
We are very.	Biz gaty.
I don't know how.	Nädip bilemok.
Okay, maybe another word.	Bolýar, belki ýene bir söz.
I thought everyone was there.	Hemmeler bar diýip pikir etdim.
I always knew what could happen.	Näme bolup biljekdigini elmydama bilýärdim.
Oh, next week.	Aý, indiki hepde.
The man is gone.	Ol adam gitdi.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
I got it	Men muny aldym
You are a big guy	Sen uly ýigit
It will never be the same.	Hiç haçan öňküsi ýaly bolmaz.
This is not difficult.	Bu kyn däl.
Something that no one else knows.	Başga hiç kimiň bilmeýän zady.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
It's been a bad week.	Erbet hepde boldy.
He said.	Diýdi.
He knows a lot.	Ol muny köp bilýär.
That's exactly what happened.	Bu edil şol ýerde boldy.
Then I saw another sound.	Soň başga bir ses gördüm.
This is not new news either.	Bu hem täze habar däl.
Next time and next time.	Indiki gezek we indiki gezek.
There is no hope.	Umyt ýok.

He knows something.	Ol bir zady bilýär.
He hopes.	Ol umyt edýär.
I'm fine now	Men häzir gowy
How wonderful it is.	Bu nähili ajaýyp.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
Now, it is necessary today.	Häzir, şu gün zerur.
You just have to	Siz diňe bar
Maybe, maybe.	Belki, belki.
You are new.	Täze özüňiz.
Of course he will.	Elbetde, eder.
Is that really the case?	Ol hakykatdanam şeýlemi?
Such a thing does not exist and cannot happen.	Şeýle zat ýok we bolup bilmeýär.
You are smart	Sen akylly.
You will truly be yourself.	Siz hakykatdanam özüňiz bolarsyňyz.
I couldn't see it.	Men ony görüp bilmedim.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu diňe bir zat.
No one is having fun.	Hiç kim hezil etmeýär.
I thought it was interesting.	Bu gyzykly diýip pikir etdim.
Not so happy for them.	Olar üçin beýle bir bagtly däl.
He doesn't do that.	Ol muny etmeýär.
This is certainly true.	Bu, elbetde dogry.
And absolutely insane.	We düýbünden däli.
Why is that.	Ol näme üçin.
There he said it.	Ol ýerde ol muny aýtdy.
I think you have to be smarter.	Meniň pikirimçe has akylly bolmaly.
It could be great.	Ajaýyp bolup biler.
So it will take some time.	Şonuň üçin biraz wagt gerek bolar.
This is not bad.	Bu erbet däl.
This cannot be true.	Bu dogry bolup bilmez.
That's more.	Bu has köp.
Everything is a lie and nothing.	Hemme zat ýalan we hiç zat ýok.
This is not money.	Bu pul däl.
She had to go home.	Öýüne gitmeli boldy.
First for me	Meniň üçin ilkinji
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
That was not the case before.	Bu öňem kän bir zat däldi.
I didn't think about it.	Men bu hakda pikir etmedim.
Not really, but it should be.	Aslynda däl, ýöne şeýle bolmaly.
I called his house and there was no one in the house.	Men onuň öýüne jaň etdim, öýde hiç kim ýok.
What a bad night	Nähili erbet gije.
It's just crazy.	Bu diňe däli.
Okay.	Bolýar.
That's who he wanted to be.	Ine, ol kim bolmak isledi.
This is not about us.	Bu biz hakda däl.
We have a happier, better way.	Bize bagtly, has gowy ýol bar.
I know very well.	Men gowy bilýärin.
He could not answer.	Ol jogap berip bilmedi.
I just didn’t know then.	Men diňe şol wagt bilmedim.
He took everything from me tonight.	Bu gije hemme zady menden aldy.
Of course.	Elbetde.
No one could help.	Hiç kim kömek edip bilmedi.
What a day	Nähili gün.
I thought there would be a way.	Bir ýol bolar öýdüpdim.
This will be more difficult for them.	Bu olar üçin has kyn bolar.
In fact, you have it yourself.	Aslynda özüňiz bar.
What are you	Sen näme .
Tell me about it.	Bu hakda maňa aýdyň.
I haven't seen it yet	Ony entek görmedim
It will not be possible tomorrow.	Ertir mümkin bolmaz.
It really helped me a lot.	Bu hakykatdanam maňa köp kömek etdi.
I'm not there yet.	Men entek ýok.
This, of course, he could not do.	Bu, elbetde, edip bilmedi.
I hope so.	Dogry diýip umyt edýärin.
He knew he wanted to tell her.	Oňa aýtmak isleýändigini bilýärdi.
I have to	Men etmeli
This is not a sound.	Bu ses däl.
Now that's a good thing.	Indi bu gaty gowy zat.
I never liked it.	Men muny hiç haçan gowy görmedim.
he said.	ol aýtdy.
What is it.	Ol näme.
He seems to be unable to make himself happy.	Ol özüni bagtly edip bilmeýän ýaly.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I don't want to be alone anymore.	Indi ýeke bolmak islämok.
This is not a thing.	Bu bir zat däl.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
He was left alone.	Ol ýeke galdy.
Then it was time to leave.	Soň gitmeli wagt geldi.
He will always be with them.	Elmydama olar bilen bolar.
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
He does the same for me.	Ol hem meniň üçin edýär.
He did not know.	Ol bilmedi.
At home all day	Bütin gün öýde.
They are things.	Olar zatlar.
It could be a year.	Bir ýyl bolup biler.
They are absolutely right.	Olar düýbünden dogry.
Maybe someone else.	Belki başga bir adam.
I can't tell her.	Men oňa aýdyp bilemok.
He doesn't want to.	Islemeýär.
It was really good.	Hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
Because we are different.	Sebäbi biz başga.
It helped me a lot.	Bu maňa köp kömek etdi.
He thought it was good.	Gowy zatlar diýip pikir etdi.
Of course not.	Elbetde beýle däl.
Now everything is possible.	Indi hemme zat mümkin.
I didn't see it.	Men ony görmedim.
We need more votes.	Bize has köp ses gerek.
Everything.	Bar zat.
It won't be bad.	Erbet bolmaz.
I don't want anything from you	Men senden hiç zat islämok
I think you just have to buy one.	Meniň pikirimçe, diňe birini satyn almaly.
The man is very agreeable.	Adam gaty razy.
This road does a lot of things.	Bu ýol köp zat edýär.
What a strange life.	Nähili geň durmuş.
It's been a few weeks.	Birnäçe hepde gitdi.

He decided.	Ol karar berdi.
It would be weird one day.	Başga bir gün geň bolardy.
Okay, we're fine.	Bolýar, biz gowy.
I thought it might be interesting.	Bu gyzykly bolup biler diýip pikir etdim.
This is something new.	Bu täze zat.
Neither was he.	Ol hem beýle däldi.
This is not for everyone, of course.	Bu, elbetde, hemmeler üçin däl.
Really	Hakykatdanam.
They are just like us.	Olar biziň ýaly.

He wants to know everything.	Hemme zady bilmek isleýär.
Not you anymore	Indi sen däl
I heard about it, there are a lot of people.	Men ol hakda eşitdim, köp adam bar.
These are interesting things.	Bu gyzykly zatlar.
He couldn't think of it.	Ol bu barada pikir edip bilmedi.
It should be now.	Indi bolmaly.
Two, no more.	Iki, indi ýok.
Nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýok.
In fact, he never did.	Aslynda ol hiç haçan diýen ýaly etmedi.
And then it's very difficult.	Soň bolsa gaty kyn.
Oh! 	Aý!
So we have it now.	Şonuň üçin biz häzir bar.
They are still smart.	Olar henizem akylly.
They are alone.	Olar ýeke.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
He still can't be himself.	Ol henizem özi bolup bilmeýär.
I know very well	Men gowy bilýärin
They are there when you need them.	Size gerek wagty olar şol ýerde.
He can't, he never will.	Ol edip bilmeýär, asla bolmaz.
You can.	Edip bilersiňiz.
In fact, it helped a little.	Aslynda bu birneme kömek etdi.
This is beautiful too.	Munuň özi hem owadan.
Not yet.	Entek ýok.
Many years ago.	Köp ýyl mundan ozal.

That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
This is not the first time.	Bu ilkinji gezek däl.
You know, but young.	Bilýärsiň, ýöne ýaş.
It was very difficult today.	Bu gün gaty kyn boldy.
Because everyone is beautiful.	Sebäbi hemmeler owadan.
We can help you.	Size kömek edip bileris.
I gave it last night.	Düýn gije berdim.
There are some very interesting things here.	Bu ýerde gaty gyzykly zatlar bar.
He said no.	Ol ýokdugyny aýtdy.
He still worries me.	Ol henizem meni biynjalyk edýär.
Nothing like that will happen.	Munuň ýaly zat bolmaz.
This is not the case today.	Bu gün hem dogry däl.
Now what really.	Indi hakykatdanam näme.
For the night	Gije üçin.
Not really good.	Aslynda gowy däl.
He seemed like the right person to do it.	Muny etmek üçin dogry adam ýalydy.
It was never a problem for him.	Onuň üçin bu hiç wagt kynçylyk däldi.
The sound came again.	Ses ýene geldi.
He wondered what had happened.	Ol näme boldy diýip pikir etdi.
I was very lonely.	Men gaty ýeke boldum.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
It seems very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly ýaly.
Not all day.	Bütin gün ýok.
Obedience to it.	Oňa boýun bolmak.
"It simply came to our notice then," he said.	Ol: "Bolmaly" diýdi.
This is not the time to do that.	Bu hem muny etmegiň wagty däl.
One was never enough.	Biri hiç wagt ýeterlik däldi.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
This will happen many times.	Bu köp gezek bolar.
I hope for a good life.	Gowy durmuş üçin umyt edýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu ýerde gowy zat.
He doesn't know what to do.	Ol näme bilenok.
Maybe he would be there again.	Belki, ol ýene şol ýerde bolardy.
Not very good.	Gaty gowy däl.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
This is really strange.	Bu hakykatdanam geň.
It comes to you quickly.	Size çalt gelýär.
He allowed them to call and call, but no one answered.	Jaň etmegine we jaň etmegine rugsat berdi, ýöne hiç kim jogap bermedi.
That was not the case.	Bu beýle zat däldi.
It went to a party.	Bu bir oturylyşyga gitdi.
I can't give you a month or a day.	Men saňa aý ýa-da gün berip bilemok.
You have to do that.	Muny etmeli.
There was no big deal.	Uly kynçylyk ýokdy.
I admire.	Men haýran.
Almost every word does.	Her söz diýen ýaly edýär.
A few people are calling me.	Birnäçe adam maňa jaň edýär.
We can see that here.	Muny şu ýerde görüp bileris.
Do well	Gowy et.
I don't have to do that.	Men muny etmeli däl.
This is absolutely stupid.	Bu düýbünden samsyk.
She is too young for me.	Ol meniň üçin gaty ýaş.
That may be enough.	Bu ýeterlik bolup biler.
Not anymore.	Indi beýle däl.
He did even more.	Ol hatda has köp zat etdi.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It would be easy.	Bu aňsat bolardy.
This is not interesting.	Bu gyzykly däl.
There is no reason for that.	Munuň üçin hiç hili sebäp ýok.
Because he is smart.	Sebäbi ol akylly.
Not good.	Gowy däl.
Then came the serious word.	Soň çynlakaý söz gaýdyp geldi.
I'm not the only one.	Men diňe özüm däl.
Then he can call me.	Soň meni jaň edip biler.
Not before.	Öňem däl.
Often this can be good.	Köplenç bu gowy bolup biler.
He could not help it.	Ol muňa kömek edip bilmedi.
Maybe this time around, something really different.	Belki bolar, bu gezek hakykatdanam başga zat.
No one was able to get him there.	Hiç kim ony ol ýere alyp bilmedi.
Oh, what a fool.	Aý, samsyk zat.
I'm sorry.	Bagyşlaň.
I haven't seen that much.	Men muny kän görmedim.
He always comes back.	Elmydama gaýdyp gelýär.
Everything bothered him.	Hemme zat ony biynjalyk etdi.
It will not happen again.	Indi beýle bolmaz.
This is, of course, a lie.	Bu, elbetde, ýalan.
I had to stop thinking like that.	Men beýle pikir etmegi bes etmeli boldum.
Of course, he didn't have to do that.	Elbetde, muny etmeli däldi.
It would be another day for them.	Olar üçin bu başga bir gün bolardy.
Similarly, he is gone.	Edil şonuň ýaly, ol gitdi.
Good.	Gowy.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
Must buy.	Satyn almaly.
There is nothing that you can do about it.	Onuň üçin edip biljek gowy zat ýok.
And you and I are together.	Biz bolsa, sen we men bilelikde.
He can do it right.	Dogry edip biler.
We had no choice.	Biziň üçin başga mümkinçilik ýokdy.
You have to go now	Indi gitmeli
It's easier.	Bu has aňsat.
It's great fun.	Bu ajaýyp hezil.
This is unlikely to happen.	Munuň beýle bolmagy ähtimal däl.
It is very easy to see what happened.	Näme bolandygyny görmek gaty aňsat.
You are young	Sen ýaş.
No one knew what had happened.	Näme bolandygyny hiç kim bilmedi.
It could be good.	Gowy bolup biler.
In fact, it was not.	Aslynda beýle däldi.
Not just for me.	Diňe meniň üçin däl.
It didn't have to be that way.	Beýle bolmaly däldi.
Yourself.	Özüňiz.
I'm there	Men ol ýerde
Two things can happen.	Iki zat bolup biler.
I am very sorry.	Men gaty gynanýaryn.
I can't say anything.	Hiç zat aýdyp biljek däl.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
Many people say.	Köp adam aýdýar.
Not at all.	Asla beýle däl.
He thought it was not enough for me.	Ol meniň üçin ýeterlik däl diýip pikir etdi.
It's hard, but it's not.	Bu gaty kyn, ýöne beýle däl.
The moon is not full.	Aý doly däl.
This is a great idea.	Bu ajaýyp pikir.
There was a loud noise.	Gaty ses çykdy.
I think about it often.	Men ol hakda köplenç pikir edýärin.
Often this is not good.	Köplenç munuň bilen gowy däl.
There will be only one.	Diňe bir bolar.
This is a big deal.	Bu uly mesele.
He could not say anything.	Ol hiç zat aýdyp bilmedi.
It turned out to be impossible.	Bu mümkin däl bolup çykdy.
He looks like an adult.	Uly adam ýaly görünýär.
I found it wonderful.	Men muny ajaýyp gördüm.
Good.	Gowy.
He returned early and came with good news.	Ol ir gaýdyp geldi we gowy habar bilen geldi.
No one can take that anymore.	Muny indi hiç kim alyp bilmez.
You need	Size gerek
No one has to tell me.	Hiç kim maňa aýtmaly däl.
We can try it now.	Häzir synap bileris.
It's been a few years.	Birnäçe ýyl boldy.
It's always hard.	Elmydama kyn.
Great if you need advice.	Maslahat gerek bolsa, ajaýyp.
The most interesting question.	Iň gyzykly sorag.
How bad this is!	Bu nähili erbet!
He could not speak.	Ol gürläp bilmedi.
I don't know how.	Nädip bilemok.
It was hard to say.	Muny aýtmak kyn boldy.
This is a great thing for me.	Bu meniň üçin ajaýyp bir zat.
No one else wants it.	Başga hiç kim muny islemeýär.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
Maybe a few times.	Belki birnäçe gezek.
It's really beautiful.	Bu hakykatdanam owadan.
There are two ways.	Iki ýol görünýär.
Three bucks will never be possible.	Üç pul hiç wagt mümkin bolmaz.
There can be both in one place.	Ol ýerde bir ýerde ikisi hem bolup biler.
This is crazy.	Bu bir däli.
Here are a few.	Bu ýerde birnäçe.
This will make you very anxious.	Bu sizi gaty biynjalyk eder.
He does it almost every year.	Her ýyl diýen ýaly edýär.
It was crazy.	Bu däli boldy.
There was nothing wrong with that.	Bu ýerde geň zat ýokdy.
I don't know how that happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny bilemok.
In fact, it can't be easy.	Aslynda aňsat bolup bilmez.
I don't like myself.	Men özümi halamok.
That was not the case.	Bu mesele däldi.
That could be a problem.	Bu bir mesele bolup biler.
How is this for you?	Bu siziň üçin nähili?
He knows what he wants.	Näme isleýändigini bilýär.
This is the answer.	Bu jogap.
He also helps me.	Ol hem maňa kömek edýär.
Going with someone else.	Başga biri bilen gitmek.
Someone had to give way.	Kimdir biri ýol bermeli boldy.
It helps somewhere.	Nirede bolsa kömek edýär.
He didn't want to.	Derrew islemedi.
It doesn't have to be.	Bu bolmaly däl.
Nothing here.	Bu ýerde hiç zat ýok.
That made sense to me.	Bu meniň üçin düşündi.
I think everyone knows that.	Meniň pikirimçe, muny hemmeler bilýär.
It's never fun.	Hiç haçan gyzykly däl.
It didn't matter, it was me.	Mesele däldi, bu men.
I thought I should.	Etmeli diýip pikir etdim.
Always, always about him.	Elmydama, hemişe onuň hakda.
That's right- this is not about us.	Dogry, biz beýle däl.
It should be that way.	Şeýle bolmaly.
He was there.	Ol ýerde bardy.
It seems so good to be right.	Dogry bolmak gaty gowy ýaly.
This is a strange life.	Bu geň durmuş.
This is not a wonderful thing.	Bu hiç hili ajaýyp zat däl.
Nothing can be harder.	Hiç zat kyn bolup bilmez.
I hope it helps.	Size kömek eder diýip umyt edýärin.
The worst.	Iň erbet.
Such an interesting word.	Şeýle gyzykly söz.
He couldn't do it anymore.	Ol indi edip bilmedi.
That bothered you.	Bu sizi biynjalyk etdi.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
Of course it will.	Elbetde bolar.
This may be true.	Bu dogry bolup biler.
Now he is not bad at all.	Indi ol asla erbet däl.
There must be one.	Biri bolmaly.
We are not close.	Biz ýakyn däl.
Always, nothing.	Hemişe, hiç zat.
I need someone who wants me.	Maňa isleýän biri gerek.
I can have fun.	Men hezil edip bilerin.
You have to give it to him.	Sen oňa bermeli.
That's enough for me.	Bu meniň üçin ýeterlik.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Munuň üçin gaty gowy zat.
I think he will.	Ol eder öýdýärin.

It was even worse.	Bu hatda gaty erbet boldy.
This, of course, is strange.	Bu, elbetde geň.
She is also very beautiful.	Ol hem gaty owadan.
I thought about it a lot.	Men bu hakda köp pikir etdim.

I can't say anymore	Indi aýdyp bilemok
He really knows that.	Muny hakykatdanam bilýär.
Of course not.	Elbetde, beýle däldi.

It's as if he saw something interesting.	Gyzykly bir zady gören ýaly.
Good here	Bu ýerde gowy.
I never wanted anything else.	Men hiç wagt başga zat islemedim.
It will not happen again.	Mundan beýläk bolmaz.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şol bir zat.
It doesn't have to be that difficult.	Munuň ýaly kyn bolmaly däl.
I can't think of it anymore.	Men indi bu hakda pikir edip bilemok.
It is usually evening.	Köplenç agşam bolýar.
Now everyone is fast.	Häzir hemmeler çalt.
Stop doing it all	Hemmesini etmegi bes et.
A few questions.	Birnäçe sorag.
We have only one possibility.	Bize diňe bir mümkinçilik bar.
I think this is a mistake.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ýalňyşlyk.
That was not the case either.	Bu hem däldi.
Nothing will happen immediately.	Derrew hiç zat bolmaz.
You can only do it, you can do it.	Diňe edip bilersiňiz, muny edip bilersiňiz.
Great	Ajaýyp.
I couldn't get here fast enough.	Men bu ýere ýeterlik çalt baryp bilmedim.
I can have two things.	Men iki zat bolup bilerin.
And there will be.	We bar bolar.
It looks more like it.	Ol has köp görünýär.
I was very difficult.	Men gaty kyn boldum.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Hiç hili ýalňyşlyk ýa-da zat ýok.
Oh, what else.	Aý, başga näme.
It really helps.	Bu hakykatdanam kömek edýär.
There is nothing for me at home.	Öýde meniň üçin hiç zat ýok.
Then you can relax.	Soň dynç alyp bilersiňiz.
That's right- this is not about me.	Meniň üçin bu dogry.
This is worse.	Bu has erbet.
He would have to do that.	Ol muny etmeli bolardy.
It's always hard.	Elmydama gaty kyn.
He agreed.	Ol muňa razy boldy.
I am very happy about that.	Men muňa gaty begenýärin.

There were a number of issues.	Birnäçe mesele bardy.
That's right.	Bu dogry.
The last day.	Iň soňky gün.

Here, man.	Ine, adam.
This may take some time.	Bu birneme wagt alyp biler.
I hoped it would.	Bolar diýip umyt etdim.
You have to do this very quickly.	Muny gaty çalt etmeli.

Good.	Gowy.
This is just another matter.	Bu diňe başga bir iş.

How could he not.	Nädip bilmedi.
This is a very bad thing.	Bu gaty erbet zat.
It will not be so.	Şeýle bolmaz.

I have to.	Men etmeli.
She looks smart.	Akylly görünýär.
He said he would do the same.	Edil şonuň ýaly etjekdigini aýtdy.
This is not the case for me.	Bu meniň üçin beýle däl.
I think it's good.	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
I didn’t do any of that.	Men munuň hiç birini etmedim.
We are life.	Biz durmuş.

He would be himself.	Ol özi bolardy.
He did something very stupid.	Ol gaty samsyk bir zat etdi.

It could be a few weeks.	Birnäçe hepde bolup biler.
There is no answer here.	Bu ýerde jogap ýok.
This is stupid.	Bu samsyk.
No one paid attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa üns bermedi.
Everything came to me.	Hemme zat maňa geldi.
We just need a good person.	Bize diňe gowy adam gerek.
He will agree.	Ol razy bolar.
You have to do something about it.	Bu barada bir zat etmeli.
I know, he likes to do it.	Bilýän, ol muny etmegi halaýar.

We need to be better.	Biz has gowy bolmaly.

Bad and good.	Erbet we gowy.
He came to us again.	Ol ýene bize geldi.
In addition.	Mundan başga.
Three days before and three days later.	Üç gün öň we üç gün soň.
This is a really big deal.	Bu hakykatdanam uly mesele.

It can't be.	Bolup bilmeýär.
This person is not good.	Bu adam gowy däl.
A week later the answer came.	Bir hepde soň jogap geldi.

When did it happen	Haçan boldy.
I don't believe that	Men muňa ynanamok

This was not a lie at all.	Bu düýbünden ýalan däldi.
We need to be better.	Biz has gowy bolmaly.
I think he knows.	Ol bilýär öýdýän.
Talk to someone.	Biri bilen gürleşmek.
I could not see anything.	Men hiç zady görüp bilmedim.
I am young.	Men ýaş.
It was great for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty gowy boldy.
This is not good at all.	Bu asla gowy däl.
Probably not a bad idea.	Erbet pikir däl bolsa gerek.
You are really good.	Siz hakykatdanam gaty gowy.
If there is anything worse.	Has erbet zat bar bolsa.
You can sleep now.	Häzir uklap bilersiňiz.
The answer came.	Jogap geldi.
He rested.	Ol dynç aldy.
Now he had nothing.	Indi onuň hiç zady ýokdy.
No problem at all.	Asla kynçylyk ýok.
This is a new person.	Bu täze adam.
I need serious help.	Maňa çynlakaý kömek gerek.
There was no one.	Hiç kim ýokdy.
He then returned home to collect the money.	Soň bolsa pul almak üçin öýüne gaýdyp geldi.
It's too bad.	Ol gaty erbet.
Tonight	Bu agşam .
Of course, he is still here.	Elbetde, ol henizem şu ýerde.
A little surprised.	Biraz geň galdy.
Maybe he's not here.	Belki, ol bu ýerde däl.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
Maybe it will help, maybe it won't.	Belki kömek eder, belki bolmaz.
Someone to pay attention to.	Üns bermeli biri.
It was as if he was having fun too.	Onuň hem hezil eden ýalydy.
He didn't either.	Ol hem etmedi.
That sounds great.	Bu gaty gowy ýaly.
I had something else.	Mende ýene bir zat bardy.
I have to say that.	Muny aýtmaly.
That sounds like a good thing.	Bu gaty gowy zat ýaly.
I have already decided.	Men eýýäm karar berdim.

He came.	Ol geldi.
He wants to go to school with you.	Ol siziň bilen mekdebe gitmek isleýär.
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
Now it was like work.	Indi iş ýalydy.
It was not two o'clock yet.	Entek sagat iki däldi.
I have to call him.	Men oňa jaň etmeli.
This watch was very bad.	Bu sagat gaty erbet boldy.
Then came a new idea.	Soň täze pikir geldi.

He can tell you about it.	Ol bu hakda size aýdyp biler.
I knew better.	Men has gowy bilýärdim.
I'm crazy about you	Men sen hakda däli.
No one can do that.	Muny hiç kim edip bilmez.
There are two ways to do this.	Bu hakda iki ýol ýok.
This is his job.	Bu onuň işi.
Okay, so it was.	Bolýar, şeýle boldy.
This is not all or nothing for me.	Bu meniň üçin hemme zat ýa-da hiç zat däl.
I think so.	Men ol hakda şeýle pikir edýärin.
I am not now.	Men häzir däl.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
I'm not for that.	Men bu iş üçin däl.
It would be nice.	Gowy bolardy.
We are stupid	Biz samsyk.
Not always a bad thing.	Elmydama erbet zat däl.
You have to be there to know that.	Muny bilmek üçin şol ýerde bolmaly.

He even knew that.	Hatda ol muny bilýärdi.
So are you	Sen şeýle.
No one told me anything.	Hiç kim maňa bir zat aýtmady.
Life will be very difficult for us.	Durmuş biziň üçin gaty kyn bolar.
This is no longer true.	Bu indi dogry däl.
Maybe that's not true.	Belki, bu gaty dogry däl.
In fact, it is very good.	Aslynda, bu gaty gowy.
He wants it.	Ol muny isleýär.
Stupid, but there is.	Samsyk, ýöne bar.
He doesn't want to talk to her at all.	Onuň bilen asla gürleşmek islemeýär.

That doesn't seem to be the case either.	Bu hem mümkin däl ýaly.
You are a beautiful girl	Sen owadan gyz
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.

That was not the case.	Bu mesele däldi.
Oh, that's what happened every year.	Aý, her ýyl şeýle boldy.

He was not.	Ol beýle däldi.
Of course it can.	Elbetde bolup biler.
He knew it.	Ol muny bilýärdi.
It made me a little stupid.	Bu meni birneme samsyk etdi.

I'm usually fine with that.	Men köplenç munuň bilen gowy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
It was almost.	Bu diýen ýalydy.

I'll do it again.	Men ýene ederin.
Must be new here.	Bu ýerde täze bolmaly.
It was not a difficult task.	Bu gaty kyn iş däldi.
Impossible.	Mümkin däl.
I just want to talk to him.	Men diňe onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň.
The question is when, if not.	Haçan, ýok bolsa sorag.
He doesn't want to tell anyone what to do.	Hiç kime näme etmelidigini aýtmak islemeýär.
It can never happen.	Hiç haçan bolup bilmez.
This is not always the case.	Elmydama beýle däl.
This is absolutely true.	Bu düýbünden dogry.
I don't believe it at all.	Men muňa asla ynanamok.
We don't need it.	Bize gerek däl.

Life would be better.	Durmuş has gowy bolardy.

A few people will.	Birnäçe adam eder.
That's all he needs.	Bu oňa gerek zat.
Things like that are no longer what they used to be.	Munuň ýaly zatlar, indi olar ýaly zat däl.
I thought about it in two ways.	Bu hakda iki ýol hakda pikir etdim.
Not really.	Aslynda beýle däl.
This was not the case.	Bu beýle däldi.
He did well.	Gowy etdi.
There was a sound and it was gone.	Ol ýerde ses çykdy we gitdi.
He did not do that.	Ol muny etmedi.
He thought it was a question for a question.	Sorag üçin bir sorag diýip pikir etdi.
This is another question.	Bu başga bir sorag.
That was it.	Bu boldy.
It looked really good.	Bu hakykatdanam hakykatdanam gaty gowy ýalydy.

We are different.	Bize başga.
So he had to give something.	Şonuň üçin bir zat bermeli boldy.
I want to help	Kömek etmek isleýärin

She seemed happy.	Ol bagtly ýalydy.
It will never be and will never be.	Hiç haçan bolmaz we bolmaz.

This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
That will be the case.	Şeýle bolar.
A little interesting.	Biraz gyzykly.
This will never happen.	Bu hiç haçan bolmaz.
There is a great reason for hope today.	Häzirki wagtda umyt üçin uly sebäp bar.
This is an idea.	Bu bir pikir.
It wasn't bad.	Erbet däldi.
In fact, it was.	Aslynda bardy.

He really responded very well.	Ol hakykatdanam gaty jogap berdi.
It really wasn't what I was looking for.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň ýaly zadym däldi.
He may return immediately tonight.	Ol şu gije derrew gaýdyp biler.
I never got it	Men hiç wagt alyp bilmedim
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
Of course, no one.	Elbetde, hiç kim ýok.
It will always be there.	Elmydama şol ýerde bolar.
He can do whatever he wants.	Islän zadyny edip biler.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Şeýle bir zat.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Wagt geldi, edip bileris.

It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
He took me for a lot of money.	Ol meni köp pul üçin aldy.
He did not want to do that.	Ol muny etmek islemedi.
He knew best.	Ol iň gowy bilýärdi.
He couldn't even see.	Ol hatda görüp bilmedi.
This is so.	Bu şeýle.
There was no one else.	Başga hiç kim ýokdy.
Good things.	Gowy zatlar.
He made no mistake.	Ol hiç hili ýalňyşlyk etmedi.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
There are more problems.	Has köp kynçylyk bar.
Maybe never.	Belki hiç haçan bolmaz.

I just let him do what he wanted.	Men oňa diňe isleýän zadyny etmäge rugsat berdim.
I was happy.	Men bagtly boldum.
This is not really possible for me.	Bu hakykatdanam meniň üçin ähtimal däl.

This will not be good for them at all.	Bu olar üçin asla gowy bolmaz.
A lot of things.	Köp zat.
At the moment.	Häzirki wagtda.
That was not the case at the time.	Şol wagt beýle däldi.
He does things and does them right.	Ol zatlary edýär we dogry edýär.
Ok how is that	Bolýar, bu nähili?
Not always.	Hemişe däl.
I had this beautiful idea.	Mende bu owadan pikir bardy.

He did not say this out loud.	Ol muny gaty ses bilen aýtmady.
This is the only way.	Bu diňe bir ýol.
In fact, it looks longer.	Aslynda, has uzak görünýär.

If this is not enough, there is another problem.	Bu ýeterlik däl bolsa, başga bir mesele bar.
This is worse.	Bu has erbet.
He called me tonight.	Ol şu gije maňa jaň etdi.
You have to say.	Sen aýtmaly.
Looks great, can go for it.	Ajaýyp görünýär, munuň üçin gidip biler.
What he had to do was nothing.	Onuň etmeli zady asla hiç zat däldi.
For some reason.	Bir sebäp bilen.
I know it happened.	Men onuň bolandygyny bilýärin.
Of course.	Elbetde.
He just wants to talk.	Ol diňe gürleşmek isleýär.
That's just right.	Bu diňe dogry.

This is a very good thing for me.	Meniň üçin bu gaty gowy zat.
Good job, everyone !.	Gowy iş, hemmeler !.

That's great.	Bu uly.
In fact, it was not.	Aslynda beýle däldi.
Surprised.	Geň galdy.
This is a call.	Bu jaň.
Obedience to him is not much.	Oňa boýun bolmak kän däl.

This is often true.	Bu köplenç dogry.
Well done.	Gowy, hezil etdi.
That was it.	Bu boldy.

I thought about time.	Wagt hakda pikir etdim.
He went happy.	Ol bagtly gitdi.
Maybe you should do the same.	Belki, şol bir zady etmeli.
There is a good chance that everything will be fine.	Hemme zadyň gowy boljakdygyna gowy mümkinçilik bar.

He can do many things.	Ol köp zady edip biler.
We can try something else.	Başga bir zady synap bileris.

Many things are strange.	Köp zat geň.
He then asked me about the police.	Soň bolsa menden polisiýa hakda sorady.

I couldn't sleep	Men uklap bilmedim
I don't know how.	Men nädip bilemok.

In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Hakykatdanam, ol bu barada pikir etmeli däl.
He did not know what he was thinking.	Ol näme hakda pikir edýändigini bilmeýärdi.

If possible.	Bu mümkin bolsa.
Too fast for an adult.	Uly adam üçin gaty çalt.
It was great.	Bu gaty gowy boldy.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
There are more people out of work.	Işden has köp adam bar.
He did not want to do that.	Ol muny etmek islemedi.
This is the correct answer.	Bu dogry jogap.
Even a beautiful girl.	Hatda owadan gyz.
This is not his business.	Bu onuň işi däl.

No one paid much attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa kän üns bermedi.

This is not enough for a day.	Bu bir gün üçin ýeterlik däl.
I know this may sound strange.	Munuň geň bolup biljekdigini bilýärin.
What's going on here? 	Bu ýerde näme bolýar?
It's here every night this week.	Bu hepde her gije şu ýerde.
He never knew he was there.	Ol özüniň bardygyny hiç wagt bilmeýärdi.
I think so.	Meniň pikirimçe.
It's hard to say.	Muny aýtmak gaty kyn.
I did, but not now.	Etdim, ýöne indi däl.
I was short.	Men gysga boldum.
That's the way it is.	Edil şonuň ýaly.
I have to tell the truth.	Men hakykaty aýtmaly.
It's time!	Wagt geldi!
This is not going to happen here.	Bu ýerde beýle bolmaz.
I was happy at the time.	Men şol wagt bagtly boldum.
I've never done that before.	Men ozal beýle etmedim.
Many questions.	Köp sorag.
Then he came back and asked for more.	Soň bolsa ýene gaýdyp geldi we has köp zat isledi.
We can't do one.	Birini edip bilmeris.
Of course not.	Elbetde, bu ýerde beýle däl.
Three months later.	Soň üç aý.
Full	Doly
This really worries me.	Bu hakykatdanam meni biynjalyk edýär.
I saw it.	Men ony gördüm.
That is the only way.	Ol ýeke-täk ýol.
I did it myself.	Men muny özüm etdim.
Very good.	Gaty gowy.
There is someone else who really wants this job.	Bu işi hakykatdanam isleýän ýaly başga biri bar.
It's always the same mistake.	Elmydama şol bir ýalňyşlyk.
Something happened to him.	Oňa bir zat boldy.
He was there at the time.	Ol şol wagt şol ýerde.
If it's good, something will happen.	Gowy bolsa, bir zat bolar.
He did it next year.	Indiki ýyl etdi.
This has always been the case and will always be.	Bu hemişe şeýle boldy we hemişe bolar.
Just do one thing for me.	Meniň üçin diňe bir zat et.
This is still a few months away.	Bu entek birnäçe aý galdy.
He knew it could be bad.	Erbet bolup biljekdigini bilýärdi.
Bad.	Erbet.
It should not be anywhere.	Ol hiç ýerde bolmaly däl.
Too many already.	Eýýäm gaty köp.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu ýerde şeýle.
It was not good.	Bu gowy däldi.
Not much.	Kän däldi.
I really have to go.	Men hakykatdanam gitmeli.
Maybe today was his happy day.	Belki, bu gün onuň bagtly güni boldy.
It was so bad.	Bu gaty erbet boldy.
He went with them.	Ol olar bilen gitdi.
You're too early.	Sen gaty ir.
Everything is fine, everything is fine.	Hemme zat gowy, hemme zat gowy.
Oh, one more thing.	Aý, ýene bir zat.
It was not easy to go.	Gitmek aňsat däldi.
I think it's good.	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
They are not just for you.	Olar diňe siziň üçin däl.
He wanted to call the police.	Ol polisiýa jaň etmek isledi.
He was always there for me.	Ol meniň üçin elmydama bardy.
It was an offer.	Bu teklip boldy.
It's just a decision.	Bu diňe karar.
How does life do that?	Durmuş muny nädip edýär.
It has to be good for that.	Munuň üçin gowy bolmaly.
He called me this morning.	Ol şu gün irden maňa jaň etdi.
Not good next week.	Geljek hepde gowy däl.
I don't want to go anywhere.	Men hiç ýere gitmek islämok.
It's fast.	Bu çalt.
He wanted to.	Ol isledi.
Not at all.	Asla beýle zat däl.
In fact, it is worse then worthless, it consumes time and resources but returns no sales.	Aslynda bu gaty erbet.
He never spoke to her.	Hiç haçan oňa söz aýtmady.
There should be more.	Has köp bolmaly.
It's easier.	Bu has aňsat.
There was a good reason for that.	Munuň gowy sebäbi bardy.
He took her home.	Öýüne alyp gitdi.
I have	Mende bar.
How good this book is.	Bu kitap nähili gowy.
Right now	Ine, şu wagt.
There are two concerns about this answer.	Bu jogap hakda iki alada bar.
He agreed.	Ol razy boldy.
The reason is complete.	Munuň sebäbi doly.
There was nothing else that anyone could do for me.	Hiç kimiň maňa edip biljek başga zady ýokdy.
There was no money for it.	Bu hakda pul ýokdy.
There was no man.	Adam ýokdy.
In fact, it is very close.	Aslynda bu gaty ýakyn.
He did not allow it.	Ol muňa ýol bermedi.
That can only be a good thing.	Bu diňe gowy zat bolup biler.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
I want to do something about it.	Men bu barada bir zat etmek isleýärin.
I couldn't say a word.	Men bir söz aýdyp bilmedim.
He seemed distant.	Ol özüne uzak ýalydy.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
What is happening here and now.	Edil şu ýerde we häzir näme bolýar.
Maybe that's the thing to do that day.	Belki, şol gün etmeli işi.
He was like a completely different person right now.	Ol edil häzir düýbünden başga adam ýalydy.
That's what I want.	Ine, sen meniň isleýän zadym.
What a day, what a day.	Nähili gün, nähili gün.
This is also good news.	Bu hem iň gowy habar.
It was good.	Gowy boldy.
He will not object.	Ol muňa garşy bolmaz.
How.	Nähili .
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Uly mesele.
It could be more fun.	Has gyzykly bolup biler.
Live song, sing song.	Durmuş aýdym, aýdym aýdyň.
He had to do it.	Ol muny etmeli boldy.
He is coming this time.	Ol şu gezek gelýär.
The girl is gone.	Gyz gitdi.
Good thing.	Gowy zat.
I had something to do.	Meniň etmeli zadym bardy.
This is also true for me.	Bu hem meniň üçin dogry.
It was as if no one was home.	Hiç kim öýde däl ýalydy.
It helped us.	Bu bize kömek etdi.
The idea was crazy.	Bu pikir däli ýalydy.
It's as hard as that.	Onuň ýaly gaty kyn.
It was not good.	Gowy däldi.
There was no one.	Hiç kim ýokdy.
It's hard, but it will be.	Bu gaty kyn, ýöne bolar.
Almost to him.	Oňa diýen ýaly.
To be myself	Özüm bolmak.
Not you	Sen däl
I had to do it twice.	Iki gezek etmeli boldum.
It was for me.	Bu meniň üçin boldy.
We are not just now.	Biz diňe häzir däl.
I think this is a great help.	Bu gaty uly kömek diýip pikir edýärin.
He knew in that look that he had failed.	Ol muny boýun almaly däldigini bilýärdi.
I'm sorry.	Men gynanýaryn.
There was nothing new.	Diňe täze zat ýokdy.
To be.	Bolmak üçin.
Nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýok.
A really great person.	Çynlakaý ajaýyp adam.
Everyone is having fun.	Her kim hezil edýär.
That's exactly what you want.	Edil seniň isleýän zadyň.
It's good to have a month off.	Bir aý dynç almak gowy.
I told her once.	Men oňa bir gezek aýtdym.
You need good.	Size gowy gerek.
This is not a problem.	Bu mesele däl.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
No one was young.	Hiç kim ýaş däldi.
I still do it every time.	Men henizem her gezek edýärin.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
There was so much to answer.	Jogap bermeli köp zat bardy.
Good.	Gowy.
I knew it.	Men muny bilýärdim.
No news, nothing.	Habar ýok, hiç zat.
There are three words.	Üç söz bar.
I know, "said David Cook, chief of The Christian Science Monitor's Washington bureau.	Bilýärin "-diýdi.
That's a lot for me.	Bu meniň üçin köp zat.
And then the next one.	Soň bolsa indiki.
Now or never thought.	Indi ýa-da hiç haçan pikir etmedi.
Not next time.	Indiki gezek däl.
We are very good.	Biz gaty gowy.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
Many things can happen.	Köp zatlar bolup biler.
Of course, there was anxiety.	Elbetde, biynjalyk boldy.
You can say a lot.	Siz köp zat aýdyp bilersiňiz.
I know, I'm scared.	Bilýän, men gaty gorkýaryn.
You and me	Sen we men.
Not bad.	Erbet däl.
He could see nothing at all.	Ol asla hiç zady görüp bilmedi.
There was no reason to do so now.	Häzir beýle etmegine hiç hili sebäp ýokdy.
This is my guy.	Bu meniň ýigit.
There is one for everyone.	Ol ýerde hemmeler üçin biri bar.
Who knows.	Kim bilýär.
Good.	Gowy.
I just want it	Men muny diňe isleýärin
He wanted it.	Ol ony isledi.
I may be there for a while.	Biraz wagt bolup bilerin.
This is the answer.	Bu jogap.
And then he came out.	Soň bolsa çykdy.
Once upon a time.	Bir gezek.
He just said goodbye.	Ol diňe gowy diýdi.
He wasn’t as much with the guy as he was.	Onuň bilen ýigit ýaly kän däldi.
It's a police matter.	Bu polisiýa işi.
I called yesterday	Düýn jaň etdim
It's about something else.	Bu başga bir zat hakda.
It must be a good thing for someone.	Kimdir biri üçin gowy iş bolmaly.
It's very difficult.	Ol gaty kyn.
I don't know anyone else	Başga birini bilemok
This is a very bad thing.	Bu gaty erbet zat.
That would always be the case.	Elmydama şeýle bolardy.
I did everything with him.	Men onuň bilen hemme zady etdim.
I don't think of anyone else.	Başga hiç kim hakda pikir etmeýärin.
The same is true for a job.	Bir iş üçin hem edil şonuň ýaly.
We don't need that.	Bu bize gerek däl.
I knew it would happen.	Boljakdygyny bilýärdim.
They are completely different.	Olar düýbünden başga zat.
I was worried about me.	Men hakda alada etdim.
It’s hard to think like that.	Munuň ýaly pikir etmek kyn.
As before.	Öňküsi ýaly.
One week left.	Bir hepde galdy.
There are still many ways to go.	Entek entek gaty köp ýol bar.
It is not necessary to make an immediate decision.	Derrew karar bermek hökman däl.
That would always be the case.	Elmydama şeýle bolardy.
Maybe life wasn’t that bad.	Belki, durmuş beýle erbet däldi.
Do it really hard.	Bu hakykatdanam gaty köp et.
He could not do that.	Ol muny edip bilmedi.
He knew he was crazy.	Ol meni däli edendigini bilýärdi.
It's not just fun.	Diňe beýle gyzykly däl.
He didn't need it.	Oňa mätäç däldi.
I couldn't say better.	Muny has gowy aýdyp bilmedim.
This will not be the first time today.	Bu gün ilkinji gezek bolmaz.
I am now	Men şu wagt
There is no right answer for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin dogry jogap ýok.
I just hope you are quick enough.	Diňe ýeterlik çalt bolarsyňyz diýip umyt edýärin.
This is not the reason.	Bu sebäp däl.
That man did it.	Ol adam muny etdi.
It really will be.	Hakykatdanam şeýle bolar.
He wants to be here and now.	Ol şu ýerde we häzir bolmak isleýär.
They are really weird.	Olar hakykatdanam geň.
Many things are right.	Köp zat dogry.
I want to be here and now.	Men şu ýerde we häzir bolmak isleýärin.
I didn't think so.	Men pikir etmedim.
It's not just me.	Bu diňe men däl.
I believe it will be good.	Gowy boljakdygyna ynanýaryn.
Okay, there’s a lot.	Bolýar, köp zat bar.
That sounds good.	Bu gowy ýaly.
He was not ready for that.	Ol muňa taýyn däldi.
Really	Hakykatdanam.
He is almost gone.	Ol gitdi diýen ýaly.
It hasn't happened yet.	Entek beýle däldi.
He was still there.	Ol henizem bardy.
This may not always be the case.	Bu hemişe dogry bolup bilmez.
I can't do anything	Men hiç zat edip bilemok
Anyone can see.	Her kim görüp biler.
You know he's making you stupid.	Seni samsyk edýändigini bilýärsiň.
No time.	Wagt ýok.
I still think about it.	Men henizem bu hakda pikir edýärin.
I am here.	Men şu ýerde.
In fact twice.	Aslynda iki gezek.
Probably.	Mümkin.
And he wanted to be there.	We ol ýerde bolmak isledi.
I heard something else.	Başga bir zadyň bardygyny eşitdim.
I think this will help you.	Bu size kömek eder diýip pikir edýärin.
I don't know what will happen next.	Menden soň näme boljakdygyny bilemok.
You can call it.	Siz oňa jaň edip bilersiňiz.
Not for everyone.	Hemmeler üçin däl.
I have been there several times.	Men birnäçe gezek bar.
There is no such way.	Munuň ýaly ýol ýok.
Alone with him.	Onuň bilen ýeke.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu gaty dogry söz.
It will be.	Bolar.
The two looked great together.	Ikisi bilelikde gaty ajaýyp ýalydy.
Because he does.	Sebäbi ol şeýle edýär.
That's all.	Diňe şu.
I'm really nothing.	Men hakykatdanam hiç zat däl.
He is like me.	Ol meniň ýaly.
may be	bolup biler.
This is indeed true.	Bu hakykatdanam dogry.
He really likes you.	Ol seni hakykatdanam halaýar.
Not everyone can do that.	Hemmeler muny edip bilmez.
This is very bad.	Bu gaty erbet.
You know everything about him.	Sen hakda hemme zady bilýärsiň.
Two days.	Iki gün.
He thought it was easy.	Aňsat diýip pikir etdi.
And then no.	Soň bolsa ýok.
They are completely different.	Olar düýbünden başga.
It's hard to do that.	Muny etmek kyn.
Other things can happen.	Başga zatlar bolup biler.
This was not a strange question.	Bu geň sorag däldi.
Not a bad person.	Erbet adam däl.
They are there.	Olar şol ýerde.
Now he understands.	Indi düşündi.
There was no other way.	Başga ýol ýokdy.
This message.	Bu habar.
He surprised me.	Ol maňa geň galdy.
Both things were good.	Iki zat hem gowy boldy.
He didn't know anything else.	Başga zady bilmeýärdi.
Good.	Gowy.
Lots of nights.	Gije köp.
The problem is the same.	Mesele edil şonuň ýaly.
For this!	Bu üçin!
He was not a bad person.	Erbet adam däldi.
He didn't need that much money.	Oňa beýle kän pul gerek däldi.
It was not necessary.	Bu zerur däldi.
There are other things to do.	Başga etmeli zatlar bar.
It did.	Bu etdi.
He was not good with it.	Ol munuň bilen gowy däldi.
This seems impossible.	Bu mümkin däl ýaly.
That can't be.	Bu bolup bilmez.
Why is that?	Näme üçin ol beýle?
By doing this I am driving myself crazy.	Men muny etmek bilen özümi däli edýärin.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
I don't know anything now	Indi hiç zat bilemok
I believe in him.	Men oňa ynanýaryn.
It will be good.	Gowy bolar.
It's long enough here.	Bu ýerde ýeterlik uzak.
Just one.	Diňe bir.
I'm fine with that.	Men munuň bilen gowy boldum.
It took a long time.	Bu köp wagt aldy.
Here he comes.	Ine, ol geldi.
Bad and upset.	Erbet we biynjalyk.
So you have to go.	Şonuň üçin gitmeli.
This is not the case at all.	Bu iş asla beýle däl.
It was no more.	Indi ýokdy.
I thought.	Men pikir etdim.
This is not a big deal.	Bu uly bir zat däl.
You are not bad.	Sen erbet däl.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
Sorry to hear that	Muny görüp bagyşlaň.
Of course, he never did.	Elbetde, ol hiç wagt kän däldi.
This idea is almost everywhere.	Bu pikir hemme ýerde diýen ýaly.
Everything is great for him.	Hemme zat onuň üçin uly zat.
Of course it was good.	Elbetde gowy boldy.
He thought.	Ol pikir etdi.
Things you never know.	Hiç wagt bilmeýän zatlary.
This book.	Bu kitap.
You just have to be there with them.	Diňe olar bilen bilelikde şol ýerde bolmaly.
There is time.	Wagt bar.

This is not a big deal.	Bu gaty uly däl.
There is no one here.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýok.
Hard work.	Kyn iş.
He can do it too.	Ol hem edip biler.
In fact, there is no other way.	Aslynda başga ýol ýok.
He also knew what he wanted to do.	Ol hem näme etmek isleýändigini bilýärdi.
He can do better than me.	Ol menden has gowy edip biler.
She was not a smart girl.	Ol akylly gyz däldi.
Now this is something new.	Indi bu täze bir zat.
The biggest question.	Iň uly sorag.
In fact, she is beautiful.	Aslynda ol bir hili owadan.
You don't have to do everything.	Hemme işi etmeli däl.
I was like, okay?	Men ýaly boldum, bolýar.
Something is wrong with this girl.	Bu gyz bilen bir zat dogry däl.
They were one thing and always were.	Olar bir zat we hemişe bardy.
Of course, he always knew that.	Elbetde, ol muny elmydama bilýärdi.
Good.	Gowy.
This book will not be anywhere else.	Bu kitap başga ýerde bolmaz.
He knows what to do.	Näme etmelidigini bilýär.
Good guy	Gowy ýigit.
This is the man.	Ine, bu adam.
I knew what could happen that night.	Şol gije näme bolup biljekdigini bilýärdim.
He didn't have much to do.	Onuň etmeli işi kän däldi.
How will he do that? 	Ol muny nädip eder?
.	.
It just seems impossible.	Diňe mümkin däl ýaly.
We are we.	Biz biz.
The question here.	Bu ýerde sorag.
I could not see anyone	Men hiç kimi görüp bilmedim
This suggestion is probably correct.	Bu teklip dogry bolsa gerek.
You are complete	Siz doly
He didn't have to worry.	Alada etmeli däldi.
Maybe it can help.	Belki kömek edip biler.
I saw this happen.	Munuň bolandygyny gördüm.
Everyone looks beautiful.	Her kim owadan görünýär.
It will not be easy.	Bu aňsat bolmaz.
'	' diýdi.
I don't know who was here last time.	Soňky gezek bu ýerde kimiň bardygyny bilemok.
He was there again.	Ol ýene bardy.
He came out.	Ol çykdy.
This is never enough for him.	Bu onuň üçin hiç wagt ýeterlik däl.
I never thought it would be easy.	Munuň aňsat boljakdygyny hiç wagt pikir etmedim.
It will always be needed.	Bu oňa hemişe gerek bolar.
It wasn't me.	Bu men däldi.
What is this?	Bu näme?.
He wanted to go, he told me.	Ol gitmek isledi, maňa aýtdy.
We can have those things again.	Biz ýene şol zatlar bolup bileris.
We are there.	Biz ol ýerde.
They are very smart.	Olar gaty akylly.
I saw it myself.	Men ony özüm gördüm.
No worries.	Alada bolmaz.
You can really do something else.	Hakykatdanam başga bir zat edip bilersiňiz.
I couldn't help it	Men oňa kömek edip bilmedim
I think it's great.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ajaýyp.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
She seemed very happy.	Ol gaty bagtly ýalydy.
The good news is, you don't have to.	Gowy habar, size zerur däl.
Of course.	Elbetde.

Had to go with that.	Munuň bilen gitmeli boldy.
It did a lot for me.	Bu meniň üçin gaty köp zat etdi.
It was really good.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy boldy.
The question is different.	Sorag başga.
That can't be the case either.	Bu hem bolup bilmez.
There was no sun today.	Bu gün gün ýokdy.
He may already be here.	Ol eýýäm şu ýerde bolmagy mümkin.
It happens to everyone.	Hemmeler üçin bolýar.
So that's great.	Şonuň üçin bu hem gaty gowy.
One last question.	Soňky bir sorag.
It seems interesting.	Gyzykly ýaly.
It's very easy.	Bu gaty aňsat.
I didn't think about it.	Bu hakda pikir etmedim.
It will take money.	Munuň üçin pul gerek bolar.
I fully believe that.	Men muňa doly ynanýaryn.
It's not just about people.	Bu diňe bir adam hakda däl.
It didn't work out for me at all.	Bu maňa asla hiç zat etmedi.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
And then, just like now, he just had to do something.	Soň bolsa, edil häzirki ýaly, diňe bir zat etmeli boldy.
New issue.	Täze mesele.
Please.	Haýyş.
He didn't want anything else.	Ol başga hiç zat islemedi.
This makes you kind of crazy.	Bu sizi bir hili däli edýär.
Twice once.	Iki gezek bir gezek.
I hope everyone does a great job.	Her kim ajaýyp iş eder diýip umyt edýärin.
Not a single day.	Hiç bir gün däl.
That was not the case last night.	Düýn agşam beýle däldi.
I don't think you can do anything else.	Başga bir zat edip bilersiňiz öýdemok.
No one spoke.	Hiç kim söz aýtmady.
Something to take with me.	Meniň bilen alyp gitmeli bir zat.
This is a problem.	Bu bir kynçylyk.
It's really beautiful.	Hakykatdanam gaty owadan.
I always think of you	Men sen hakda hemişe pikir edýärin.
Of course, this is a very bad idea.	Elbetde, bu gaty erbet pikir.
And of course.	We aýdyň.
Because he does what he wants.	Sebäbi islän zadyny edýär.
Too short.	Gaty gysga.
I was not, and he was not.	Men beýle däldim, ol hem däldi.
What's the matter?	Mesele näme?
Right here, right here.	Edil şu ýerde, şu ýerde.
Here is the last thought.	Ine soňky pikir.
This is a very difficult question.	Bu gaty kyn sorag.
You can do this now.	Muny şu wagt edip bilersiňiz.
The stupidest.	Iň samsyk.
Not long.	Uzak däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu hem gowy zat.
Now this is a good police job.	Indi bu gowy polisiýa işi.
He could not get it.	Ol muny alyp bilmedi.
I'd like to see it again.	Men ony ýene görmek isleýärin.
I don’t like it or believe it.	Men ony halamok ýa-da ynanamok.
In fact, it is.	Aslynda şeýle.
.	.
It was good with you.	Bu siziň bilen gowy boldy.
She is very good.	Ol gaty gowy.
I thought it would be good.	Gowy bolar diýip pikir etdim.
What did he think?	Ol näme hakda pikir etdi.
Every day, but today was good.	Her gün, ýöne şu gün gowy boldy.
Of course not.	Elbetde, özi hakda däl.
These two things are different.	Bu iki zat başga.
He had to stop doing it.	Ol muny etmegi bes etmeli boldy.
I heard that.	Men muny eşitdim.
You didn't need help.	Size kömek gerek däldi.
Every madman.	Her däli.
It was a really difficult day.	Bu hakykatdanam kyn gün boldy.
Maybe he knows everything about something.	Belki, bir zat hakda hemme zady bilýän bolsa gerek.
I think it's good this time.	Bu gezek gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
It's not stupid, it's true.	Bu samsyk däl, dogry.
Too much for us.	Bize gaty köp.
She is really worried.	Ol hakykatdanam gaty biynjalyk.
Too many.	Gaty köp.
It won’t be big yet.	Bu entek uly bolmaz.
It will never be beautiful.	Hiç haçan owadan bolmaz.
They should be better.	Olar has gowy bolmaly.
Very interesting answer.	Gaty gyzykly jogap.
He knows everything.	Ol hemme zady bilýär.
Good, very good.	Gowy, gaty gowy.
How happy we are!	Biz nähili bagtly!
We may need it.	Bize gerek bolup biler.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
One of the most.	Iň köp biri.
I have to.	Men etmeli.
I'm scared.	Men gorkýaryn.
This has always been the case.	Elmydama şeýle boldy.
And then it got really bad.	Soň bolsa gaty erbet boldy.
This is not me.	Bu menden däl.
There is no good answer.	Gowy jogap ýok.
There is something really good going on here.	Bu ýerde hakykatdanam gaty gowy zat bar.
Just like that !.	Edil şu ýaly!.
Of course, being alone was not enough for them.	Elbetde, diňe biziň bolmak olar üçin ýeterlik däldi.
It's too late.	Has gijä galdy.
He does nothing else.	Başga hiç zat etmeýär.
He gave it to me.	Ol maňa berdi.
I'm not having fun anymore.	Indi hezil etmedim.
That could be the only thing.	Bu ýekeje zat bolup biler.
They were everywhere.	Olar hemme ýerde bardy.
This is bad news.	Bu erbet habar.
Seriously serious.	Ajaýyp çynlakaý.
He was right.	Ol maňa dogry aýtdy.
No two nights.	Iki gije ýok.
Just for that.	Diňe munuň üçin.
We need things.	Bize zatlar gerek.
I knew about them.	Men olar hakda bilýärdim.
She looks very young.	Ol gaty ýaş görünýär.
He could still see.	Ol henizem görüp bilýärdi.
To go	Gitmek
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
You must have seen it.	Siz ony gören bolmaly.
Okay.	Bolýar.
Because the same thing.	Sebäbi, şol bir zat.
Everything was fine.	Hemme zat gowy boldy.
The problem.	Mesele.
I think that could be the case.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu şeýle bolup biler.
Probably the next best thing.	Indiki iň gowy zat bolsa gerek.
I do this every day.	Men muny her gün edýärin.
You know	Bilýärsiň.
Maybe I can do that.	Belki muny edip bilerin.
It's a big mistake right now.	Häzirki wagtda uly ýalňyşlyk.
I didn't call him.	Men oňa jaň etmedim.
We need something else.	Bize başga zat gerek.
You have to admit that.	Muny boýun almaly.
I have to call	Men jaň etmeli
I'm not good.	Men gowy däl.
I thought it might be somewhere else.	Başga bir ýerde bolup biler öýdüpdim.
That's what happened.	Ine, şeýle boldy.
Three in the morning	Irden üç.
I can take us there.	Bizi ol ýere alyp bilerin.
He could not go.	Ol gidip bilmedi.
I wish no one was there.	Hiç kimiň ýokdugyny isleýärin.
How good it was.	Ol nähili gowy bolup çykdy.
This is bad news.	Bu erbet habar.
It's a little cool.	Biraz ajaýyp.
That's not enough for me.	Bu meniň üçin ýeterlik däl.
There was always a way.	Elmydama bir ýol bardy.
He will do it tomorrow.	Ertir eder.
The answer was no money.	Jogap pul däldi.
Other things were not enough.	Başga zatlar ýeterlik däldi.
He had nothing else.	Oňa başga zat ýokdy.
Of course, someone must know that.	Elbetde, bu barada kimdir biri bilýän bolmaly.
It's about life.	Bu durmuş hakda.
They are great with it.	Olar munuň bilen ajaýyp.
It was bad.	Bu erbet boldy.
This is a really good thing.	Bu hakykatdanam gowy zat.
It's easier.	Bu has aňsat.
It always has been and always will be.	Elmydama bardy we hemişe bolar.
I still think about them.	Men henizem olar hakda pikir edýärin.
They desperately need us.	Olar bize gaty mätäç.
Too hard.	Gaty gaty.
Another issue today.	Bu gün başga bir mesele.
I'm not far away now.	Men häzir uzak däl.
I have more questions.	Mende has köp sorag bar.
I can speak there.	Men ol ýerde gürläp bilerin.
There.	Ol ýerde.
You are just a human being.	Sen diňe adam.
A bad man is wise.	Erbet adam akylly.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.
This has been the case for him all day.	Bütin gün onuň üçin şeýle boldy.
So there is a big reason for that.	Şonuň üçin munuň uly sebäbi bar.
It's close.	Bu ýakyn.
The problem is bad.	Mesele erbet.
He didn't have to do that.	Ol beýle etmeli däldi.
It can really go away.	Bu hakykatdanam gidip biler.
Only this time.	Diňe şu gezek.
It was good.	Bu gowy boldy.
That and other things.	Bu we başga zatlar.
Only two hours, but very good.	Diňe iki sagat, ýöne gaty gowy.
Very worried.	Gaty alada.
This is not the case at all.	Bu asla beýle däl.
He went with me.	Ol meniň bilen gitdi.
This is not surprising.	Bu geň däl.
That's right.	Dogry.
This seems strange.	Bu geň görünýär.
He is no longer good.	Ol indi gowy däl.
This is an idea.	Bu pikir.
That could be really big.	Bu hakykatdanam uly bolup biler.
I called him.	Men oňa jaň etdim.
Giving is too short.	Bermek gaty gysga.
Of course.	Elbetde.
It's not like you're going against it.	Oňa garşy gitmek seniň ýaly däl.
I think that would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
I think it will be good.	Gowy bolar öýdýän.
I want to talk to him now.	Men häzir onuň bilen gürleşmek isleýärin.
I may have.	Mende bolup biler.
Now this is not always the case.	Indi bu hemişe mesele däl.
Everything happened that night.	Şol gije hemme zat boldy.
Not a big lie.	Uly ýalan däl.
She thought she was beautiful.	Ol owadan diýip pikir etdi.
Tell him.	Oňa aýdyň.
So stupid and stupid.	Şonuň üçin samsyk we samsyk.
Just like last year.	Geçen ýyl ýaly.
He likes it.	Ol muny halaýar.
Very new at the moment.	Häzirki wagtda gaty täze.
It doesn't have to be you or me anymore.	Indi sen ýa-da men bolmaly däl.
No one can call.	Hiç kim jaň edip bilmez.
There are two answers to this.	Muňa iki jogap bar.
One day, maybe.	Bir gün, belki.
He was not even close.	Ol hatda ýakyn hem däldi.
Maybe it will.	Belki bolar.
He is.	Ol şeýle.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
Tell me.	Maňa aýdyň.
What?	Näme?
I think we can do that.	Muny edip bileris diýip pikir edýärin.
Can't help this time.	Bu wagt kömek edip bolmaz.
I am often alone.	Men köplenç ýeke özüm.
I want to say that.	Men muny aýtmak isleýärin.
It's kind of.	Bu bir hili.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
It can be hard.	Gaty bolup biler.
Everything.	Hemme zat.
It was a very interesting book.	Bu gaty gyzykly kitap boldy.
In fact, it is still true.	Aslynda henizem dogry.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
It will not be so.	Beýle bolmaz.
That it would be good.	Gowy boljakdygyny.
I'm not completely stupid.	Men doly samsyk däl.
It's too big for me.	Meniň üçin bu gaty uly.
It's been a long time coming.	Şeýle uzak wagt öň ýalydy.
Beautiful words are true.	Owadan söz dogry.
I hope so.	Men muňa umyt edýärin.
This song is about them.	Bu aýdym olar hakda.
Now he knows you exist.	Indi ol seniň bardygyny bilýär.
It's about a man.	Bu adam hakda.
So there was no other life for him.	Şonuň üçin onuň üçin başga durmuş ýokdy.
You are not just beautiful.	Siz diňe bir owadan däl.
The food is wonderful and fresh.	Nahar ajaýyp we täze.
I didn't see him or her.	Men ony ýa-da ony görmedim.
I haven't done that before.	Öň beýle etmedim.
Now he is alone.	Indi ol ýeke boldy.
He was like an old man.	Uly ýigit ýalydy.
It makes everything better.	Hemme zady has gowy edýär.
I think this is the right decision.	Bu dogry karar diýip pikir edýärin.
You can be of great help.	Siz uly kömek edip bilersiňiz.
That's exactly what happened.	Hakykatdanam şeýle boldy.
They are so stupid.	Olar gaty samsyk.
This is not possible.	Bu mümkin däl.
This is a problem.	Bu bir mesele.
It's a mistake and everyone knows that.	Bir ýalňyşlyk we bu barada hemmeler biler.
Now it's time for him.	Indi onuň üçin wagt geldi.
Of course, there was a reason for that, but that doesn't seem to be the case.	Elbetde, munuň bir sebäbi bardy, ýöne bu mümkin däl ýaly.
It's about money.	Bu pul hakda.
It's always the same with you.	Elmydama seniň bilen şeýle.
Not much can be said about him.	Ol hakda kän zat aýdyp bolmaz.
He knew that day.	Ol şol gün bilýärdi.
Surprisingly.	Munuň bilen geň.
I have nothing else for you right now.	Meniň şu wagt saňa başga zadym ýok.
I will destroy it.	Men ony ýok ederin.
He was home for two weeks.	Ol iki hepde öýde boldy.
It looks very bad.	Ol gaty erbet görünýär.
The new day will come.	Täze gün geler.
This time he is not there.	Bu gezek ol ýerde däl.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe bu barada akylly bolmaly.
It was hard.	Bu kyn boldy.
I never wanted to be a good girl.	Men hiç wagt gowy gyz bolmak islemedim.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Bu düýbünden erbet zat däl.
I think they are very bad.	Meniň pikirimçe, olar gaty erbet.
I know because you're human.	Bilýärin, sebäbi sen adam.
A few weeks ago.	Birnäçe hepde öň.
There was also a book.	Kitap hem bardy.
What to do.	Näme etjek.
He didn't do it for the sake of love.	Gowy görmek üçin etmedi.
They are not there yet.	Olar henizem ýok.
With that.	Bu bilen.
He didn't need the worst news yet.	Oňa häzir däl, has erbet habar gerek däldi.
He said no one was there.	Bu ýerde hiç kim ýok diýdi.
She is a crazy girl.	Ol däli gyz.
He could not allow it.	Ol muňa rugsat berip bilmedi.
It will be possible.	Mümkin bolar.
He already knew what to do.	Ol näme etjekdigini eýýäm bilýärdi.
He understood correctly.	Ol dogry düşündi.
I am still somewhere.	Men henizem bir ýerde bar.
He no longer cared about anyone or anything.	Ol indi hiç kime ýa-da bir zat hakda alada etmedi.
I am no more.	Men indi däl.
Maybe so.	Belki şeýle bolar.
There was something strange about it.	Bu ýerde geň bir zat bardy.
Maybe he didn't have to say anything.	Belki, ol hiç zat aýtmaly däldi.
It was there.	Bu bardy.
I did not know	Bilmedim
There was no hope.	Umyt ýok boldy.
The same thing happened this year.	Bu ýyl hem şeýle boldy.
Ready to go home.	Täze öýüne gitmäge taýyn.
He was young.	Ol ýaş wagty.
It's too short.	Bu gaty gysga.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I'm not there yet.	Men entek ýok.
This is very true.	Bu gaty dogry.
I think it's good.	Gowy diýip pikir edýärin.
This is not necessarily the case either.	Bu hem hökman däl.
That can't be the case.	Bu beýle bolup bilmez.
Just not enough.	Diňe ýeterlik däl.
He is also a good man.	Şeýle hem, ol gowy adam.
This is not good.	Bu gowy däl.
About him.	Ol hakda.
It's a little hard to say.	Söz bilen aýtmak biraz kyn.
I think that would be great.	Bu gaty gowy bolar diýip pikir edýärin.
It should not be harmed.	Oňa zyýan bermeli däl.
Will have to go	Gitmeli bolar.
This is not the case.	Bu beýle däl.
It will never happen.	Bu asla bolmaz.
It looks good.	Gowy ýaly görünýär.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
And then there is never.	Soň bolsa hiç haçan ýok.
So tell me.	Şonuň üçin maňa aýdyň.
I almost.	Men diýen ýaly.
They were not.	Olar däldi.
It will be one of two things.	Iki zadyň biri bolar.
I just have to do it.	Men diňe etmeli.
I believe that very much.	Men muňa gaty ynanýaryn.
He knew and did nothing.	Ol bilýärdi we hiç zat etmedi.
No one thought it would happen, but it did.	Hiç kim beýle bolar diýip pikir etmedi, ýöne şeýle boldy.
It was a good thing he did.	Bu onuň gowy işi boldy.
Everything was difficult.	Hemme zat kyn boldy.
I had no such problem.	Mende beýle mesele ýokdy.
Someone likes it.	Kimdir biri ony halaýar.
In fact, he was not.	Aslynda ol beýle däldi.
This is not easy.	Bu beýle aňsat däl.
Of course, I think about it very well.	Elbetde, bu barada gaty gowy pikir edýärin.
It really should be enough.	Hakykatdanam, ýeterlik bolmaly.
I didn’t really get it right.	Men hakykatdanam dogry görmedim.
Happy to buy !.	Satyn almak bagtly!.
A lot can happen.	Köp zat bolup biler.
I didn't do anything yesterday.	Düýn hiç zat etmedim.
Not a good answer.	Gowy jogap däl.
Not hard, but close.	Gaty däl, ýöne ýakyn.
She is happy.	Ol bagtly.
It's been two weeks.	Iki hepde çykdy.
You have to tell him about them.	Oňa olar hakda habar bermeli.
A few bucks.	Birnäçe pul.
Now he knew it too.	Indi ol hem bilýärdi.
It made him happy.	Bu oňa lezzet berdi.
This is great.	Bu gaty gowy.
Not really an issue.	Hakykatdanam, bir mesele däl.
He wants to know the truth.	Ol hakykaty bilmek isleýär.
There was nothing else I could do.	Başga edip biljek başga zady ýokdy.
Needless to say, now.	Indi aýtmak hökman däl.
And then.	Soň bolsa.
This is what happened.	Bu şeýle boldy.
It was nice to be with someone else.	Başga biri bilen bolmak gowy boldy.
Not so.	Beýle däl.
This was not a mistake.	Bu ýalňyşlyk däldi.
In fact, it will be very difficult.	Aslynda bu gaty kyn bolar.
No way.	Bolmaz.
Of course.	Elbetde.
This was not the case.	Bu iş däldi.
I didn't want to be there.	Men ol ýerde bolmak islemedim.
He is not alone.	Ol ýeke däl.
He was not close to her.	Oňa ýakyn däldi.
He is a bad man.	Ol erbet adam.
Too hard and too fast.	Gaty kyn we gaty çalt.
This is the first time this has happened.	Bu ilkinji we ilkinji gezek boldy.
Here it is.	Ine, şu ýerde.
She is beautiful.	Ol owadan.
Oh, he said.	Aý, ol aýtdy.
He couldn't do it anymore.	Indi edip bilmedi.
It was not for him.	Bu onuň üçin däldi.
It will never happen.	Hiç haçan bolmaz.
You can too.	Siz hem bolup bilersiňiz.
You don't have to tell me that.	Saňa muny aýtmak hökman däl.
Someone else did it.	Başga biri bu işi etdi.
I have to go now.	Maňa şu wagt gitmeli.
I think he really wants that.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu meseläni hakykatdanam isleýär.
And then there was no one there.	Soň bolsa ol ýerde asla ýokdy.
I think it was good.	Gowy boldy diýip pikir edýärin.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu indi mesele.
That's what he did.	Ine, muny şeýle etdi.
There is a reason for this.	Munuň sebäbi bar.
He thought it was fast.	Çalt diýip pikir etdi.
True, there is no bad news.	Dogry, erbet habar ýok.
Maybe he wants that too.	Belki, ol hem muny isleýär.
Of course, this is not always true.	Elbetde, bu hemişe dogry däl.
How bad is that.	Bu nähili erbet.
It seems to be happening right now.	Ol edil häzir bolýan ýaly.
This is not enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl.
He is not.	Ol beýle däl.
That seemed right to him.	Bu oňa dogry ýalydy.
The two would have to go.	Bu ikisi gitmeli bolardy.
Everything will take care of itself.	Hemme zat özi hakda alada eder.
It was a wonderful night.	Bu ajaýyp gije boldy.
I'll take care of that.	Men muňa alada ederin.
This is so stupid.	Bu gaty samsyk.
The future.	Geljek.
I am happy.	Men begenýärin.
I didn't mean to offend you.	Indi aýtmak islemedim.
He just didn’t want to be there.	Ol diňe ol ýerde bolmak islemedi.
It has to be really good.	Hakykatdanam has gowy bolmaly.
I just can't do it	Diňe edip bilemok
I wasn't really like that.	Men aslynda beýle däldim.
This is my hope.	Bu maňa umyt.
A job	Bir iş
So be prepared.	Şonuň üçin taýyn bolmaly.
All together	Hemmeler bilelikde.
It's too fast.	Ol gaty çalt.
Relaxed, ready to go.	Dynç aldy, gitmäge taýyn.
There is no time for that.	Munuň üçin wagty ýok.
That was not the case.	Munuň sebäbi däldi.
Many people did.	Köp adam etdi.
Like everyone else.	Hemmeler ýaly.
It's not me! 	Bu men däl!
.	.
Tell me how it happened.	Munuň nähili bolandygyny aýdyň.
It happened.	Ol boldy.
That's enough.	Bu ýeterlik.
There is no reason.	Sebäp ýok.
A lot of people don’t want to do that.	Köp adam muny etmek islemeýär.
No one else knew he was here.	Bu ýerde bolandygyny başga hiç kim bilmeýärdi.
He did not want her to think badly.	Ol onuň erbet zat pikir etmegini islemedi.
I really do.	Men hakykatdanam şeýle edýärin.
It was lonely.	Bu ýeke boldy.
Something similar.	Edil şonuň ýaly bir zat.
This makes him very anxious.	Bu ony gaty biynjalyk edýär.
I don't need much.	Maňa kän zat gerek däl.
We can do better.	Biz has gowy edip bileris.
He is here.	Ol şu ýerde.
That was the problem.	Bu mesele boldy.
It was not a decision for me.	Bu meniň üçin karar däldi.
Of course not this year.	Elbetde, bu ýyl däl.
Not a problem.	Mesele däl.
I did nothing with him.	Men onuň bilen hiç zat etmedim.
You don't have to worry much.	Kän alada etmeli däl.
That's it.	Ine, şol ýerde.
Always there	Hemişe bar.
I haven't seen much.	Men beýle köp görmedim.
Oh, tell me what you have.	Aý, näme bar bolsa aýdyň.
You have to do one thing or another.	Bir ýa-da başga bir zat etmeli.
It will take us a few days.	Bize birnäçe gün gerek bolar.
Good job	Gowy iş.
He knew nothing but me.	Ol menden başga zady bilmeýärdi.
Not bad! 	Erbet däl!

This is strange.	Bu geň zat.
No one wants that.	Hiç kim muny islemeýär.
There will be more.	Has köp bolar.
I didn't need help.	Maňa kömek gerek däldi.
He is no longer young.	Ol indi ýaş däl.
I think that's possible.	Bu mümkin diýip pikir edýärin.
Something about you	Sen hakda bir zat
need to	gerek.
The same day will come for you.	Şol gün hem siziň üçin geler.
He has said this several times.	Ol muny birnäçe gezek aýtdy.
There are many ways.	Köp ýol bar.
Not for me.	Meniň üçin däl.
He promised to do it.	Etjekdigine söz berdi.
Beautiful year	Owadan ýyl.
He told us to have fun.	Ol bize hezil etmelidigini aýtdy.
He didn't really know.	Ol hakykatdanam bilmeýärdi.
You have to go every day.	Her gün gitmeli.
This is very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn.
I can do it elsewhere.	Başga bir ýerde edip bilerin.
They are not smart.	Olar akylly däl.
There is still some time.	Entek birnäçe wagt bar.
Doing so can drive you crazy.	Şeýle etmek sizi däli edip biler.
Too much, too fast.	Gaty köp, gaty çalt.
It's not like you	Bu seniň ýaly däl
Of course not.	Elbetde dogry däl.
That's right.	Dogry.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
So it just has to be right.	Şonuň üçin diňe dogry bolmaly.
I don't think it should be allowed.	Rugsat bermeli däl öýdemok.
Of course, this is possible.	Elbetde, bu mümkin.
I still want to.	Men henizem isleýärin.
The answer was yes.	Jogap şeýle boldy.
This was not true.	Bu dogry däldi.
Hopefully something better will come.	Has gowy bir zat geler diýen umyt.
This is a big mistake.	Bu uly ýalňyşlyk.
As good as ever.	Öňküsi ýaly gowy.
Not with a loud voice.	Gaty ses bilen däl.
No yesterday.	Düýn ýok.
It was nothing.	Bu hiç zat däldi.
may be	bolup biler.
Everything was just as it was.	Hemme zat edil özi ýaly boldy.
I want to do that.	Men muny etmek isleýärin.
Just for you, beautiful.	Edil saňa, owadan.
This is not the case, and it is not.	Bu kän bir ýaly däl we beýle däl.
No problem.	Hiç hili mesele ýok.
He did not vote.	Ol ses bermedi.
No one knew what had happened to him.	Hiç kim onuň näme bolandygyny bilmeýärdi.
I have to go.	Men gitmeli.
I always had.	Mende elmydama bardy.
I can tell you.	Men size aýdyp bilerin.
That's it! 	Boldy et!
He needs a lot of help.	Oňa uly kömek gerek.
I want to be my own thing.	Men öz zadym bolmak isleýärin.
Very interesting.	Gaty gyzykly.
If so, we are happy.	Şeýle bolsa, biz bagtly.
It would be nice to talk a little bit.	Biraz gürleşmek zerur bolardy.
Not only that.	Diňe bu däl.
I hope you can help.	Kömek edip bilersiňiz diýip umyt edýärin.
Because it’s not just life.	Sebäbi bu diňe durmuş däl.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mundan başga çynlakaý zat ýok.
Everyone here knows this.	Muny bu ýerde hemmeler bilýär.
I want to do two things.	Iki zat etmek isleýärin.
No one should.	Hiç biri bolmaly däl.
That's right- you're right.	Dogry, sen dogry ýerde.
There could be more.	Has köp zat bolup biler.
That sounds great.	Bu gaty gowy ýaly.
Always for her.	Elmydama onuň üçin.
He agrees.	Ol hem muňa razy.
This is really him.	Bu hakykatdanam onuň özi.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Diňe birini etmeli.
The answer came quickly.	Jogap çalt geldi.
Well behaved.	Gowy alyp bardy.
This can make you very anxious.	Bu sizi gaty biynjalyk edip biler.
This is something he knows very well.	Bu onuň gaty gowy bilýän zady.
She is also smart.	Ol hem akylly.
I don't need a problem here.	Maňa bu ýerde kynçylyk gerek däl.
He was still there.	Ol henizem bardy.
He wanted me.	Ol meni isledi.
There may be more.	Has köp bolup biler.
It was very difficult.	Bu gaty kyn boldy.
This is interesting.	Bu gyzykly.
OK, tell me not.	Bolýar, beýle däldigini aýdyň.
He could not do it again.	Ol muny ýene edip bilmedi.
He took her all night.	Bütin gije ony alyp gitdi.
Nowhere.	Hiç ýerde ýok.
Last year.	Geçen ýyl.
It could be.	Bolup biler.
It also seems like a lot of work.	Şeýle hem köp iş ýaly bolup görünýär.
This does not seem to be the case.	Bu gaty ähtimal däl ýaly.
She was happy.	Ol bagtly boldy.
It's too early to say.	Muny aýtmak entek ir.
You have to go more.	Has köp gitmeli.
You are not good	Sen gowy däl
They must be aware of this.	Olar muny bilýän bolmaly.
Of course not.	Elbetde mümkin däl.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
I just helped.	Men diňe kömek etdim.
I have nothing.	Mende hiç zat ýok.
It went well.	Gowy gitdi.
And then never.	Soň bolsa hiç haçan.
He had no time for anyone.	Onuň hiç kim üçin wagty ýokdy.
Great	Ajaýyp.
It was new.	Bu täze boldy.
This is with me.	Bu meniň bilen.
Now everyone is everywhere.	Indi hemmeler hemme ýerde.
It's as if he never did it.	Ol muny hiç wagt eden ýaly.
I still believe that.	Men henizem muňa ynanýaryn.
It was not a pleasure.	Bu bir lezzet däldi.
He understood that.	Ol muňa düşündi.
It can really do that.	Bu hakykatdanam edip biler.
You have to agree to that.	Siz muňa razy bolmaly.
Whether he wanted it or not.	Isledi ýa-da islemedi.
They will not be like him.	Olar onuň ýaly bolmaz.
Really just you and me.	Hakykatdanam diňe sen we men.
He already knew.	Ol eýýäm bilýärdi.
This is a job.	Bu bir iş.
The most interesting really.	Iň gyzykly hakykatdanam.
This will not be good.	Bu gowy bolmaz.
I didn’t know if he would do it or not.	Etjekdigini ýa-da ýokdugyny bilmedim.
I can go	Men baryp bilerin.
This is probably what he did.	Bu onuň eden bolmagy mümkin.
It must have been done by two or two people.	Bu ony iki ýa-da iki adam eden bolmaly.
I do not agree with that.	Men muňa razy däl.
In fact we can say more.	Aslynda has köp zat aýdyp bileris.
Really good job.	Hakykatdanam gowy iş.
This is a bad way.	Bu erbet ýol.
Okay, how do you do that.	Bolýar, muny nädip etmeli.
The impossible was possible.	Mümkin däl zat mümkin boldy.
This is not true.	Bu dogry däl.

He was young.	Ol ýaş wagty.
Money is a thing.	Pul bir zat.
He doesn't need more.	Oňa has köp zat gerek däl.
Good.	Gowy.
Of course very fast.	Elbetde gaty çalt.

This message.	Bu habar.
He knew he would know the right time.	Ol dogry wagty biljekdigini bilýärdi.

I didn't know then.	Men şol wagt bilmedim.
So it was not really new.	Şonuň üçin bu hakykatdanam täze zat däldi.
He just did.	Diňe etdi.
There is another possibility.	Başga bir mümkinçilik bar.
This is a job.	Bu bir iş.
He took me home.	Ol meni öýüne alyp gitdi.
He always did.	Elmydama etdi.
That was not the case before.	Öň beýle däldi.
So this is a very bad thing, a mistake.	Şonuň üçin bu gaty erbet zat, ýalňyşlyk.
It’s not hard to see why this could happen.	Munuň näme üçin bolup biljekdigini görmek kyn däl.
He immediately understood.	Ol derrew düşündi.
He didn't have to.	Ol bolmaly däldi.
He answered me.	Ol maňa jogap berdi.
He needs a man.	Oňa adam gerek.
That can only be a problem.	Bu diňe bir mesele bolup biler.
You know better than that.	Mundan has gowy bilýärsiň.
I didn't know what he wanted.	Men onuň näme isleýändigini bilmeýärdim.
They are alone.	Olar ýeke.
He is very good to me.	Ol meniň üçin gaty gowy.
He no longer wanted to hurt her.	Mundan beýläk oňa zyýan bermek islemedi.
Better a poor horse than no horse at all.	Ol ýerde menden gowy.

There is no better time now.	Häzirki wagtda has gowy wagt ýok.
It should be.	Bu bolmaly.

He bought me.	Ol meni satyn aldy.
These things will happen.	Bu zatlar bolar.

This is smart.	Bu akylly.
I did not know.	Men bilmedim.
He knew there was something else.	Ol başga bir zadyň bardygyny bilýärdi.
I don't know myself	Men özümi bilemok
Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly.	Belki, gaty çalt islän bolmagy mümkin.
There was nothing else here.	Bu ýerde başga hiç zat ýokdy.
A lot of work.	Köp iş.
It always seemed like that.	Elmydama şeýle bolýan ýalydy.
She began to worry about him.	Ol hakda alada edip başlady.
I didn't find it difficult.	Men kyn görmedim.
What he saw was impossible.	Onuň gören zady mümkin däldi.
A lot of money.	Köp pul.
He can’t just be happy.	Ol diňe bagtly bolup bilmeýär.
There is no life in that house.	Şol öýde durmuş ýok.
I want to go	Men gitmek isleýärin
I have never seen anything like it.	Hiç haçan beýle zady görmedim.
I think that was the first week.	Meniň pikirimçe, bu ilkinji hepde boldy.
He didn't know what to think.	Ol näme pikir edýändigini bilmeýärdi.
We can even do more.	Hatda has köp zat edip bileris.

There is almost nothing good about it.	Munuň gowy zady ýok diýen ýaly.
A young man will come.	Bir ýigit geler.

It didn't bother me.	Bu meni biynjalyk etmedi.
Last but not least.	Iň soňky.
I think it could be.	Meniň pikirimçe, bolup biler.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Bu edil şeýle.
That will no longer be the case.	Mundan beýläk beýle bolmaz.
Here's the problem.	Ine, kynçylyk şu ýerde.
I have many times.	Mende köp gezek bar.
This is worse.	Bu has erbet.

There was something about him.	Ol hakda bir zat bardy.
That could be about me.	Bu men hakda bolup biler.
There was another reason.	Başga bir sebäp boldy.
Of course, it can't be that difficult.	Elbetde, beýle kyn bolup bilmez.
I'm worried about that.	Men bu barada alada edýärin.

We are still here.	Biz henizem şu ýerde.
He knew what to do here.	Ol bu ýerde näme etmelidigini bilýärdi.
He doesn't care.	Ol bu barada mesele etmeýär.
It's still a long way off.	Bu entek gaty uzak.
Must be great.	Ajaýyp bolmaly.

Yesterday was a wonderful day.	Düýn ajaýyp gün boldy.
You can lend a lot or just one or two.	Köp karz berip bilersiňiz ýa-da diňe bir ýa-da iki.
This is not far off.	Bu uzak däl.
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.	Ol meniň hakda şeýle pikir etmeli.
This will never happen to him.	Bu onuň üçin asla bolmaz.
Because that's all you need.	Sebäbi size gerek zat.
Then everyone got one.	Soň her kim birini aldy.
He didn't either.	Ol hem etmedi.
Everything is fine now.	Häzir hemme zat gowy.
There was no one.	Hiç biri ýokdy.
It's easy to say.	Muny aýtmak aňsat.
It was too much.	Gaty köp boldy.
This is very strange.	Bu gaty geň zat.
Good.	Gowy.
Why not.	Näme üçin ýok .
Very good all week.	Bütin hepde gaty gowy.

Anyone can do that.	Her kim muny edip biler.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.
I had never thought of that before.	Men ozal bu hakda pikir etmedim.
This is the only thing.	Bu ýeke-täk zat.
So that's the question for you.	Şonuň üçin bu sorag size.
You are always beautiful.	Siz elmydama ajaýyp.
Nothing else.	Başga hiç zat ýok.
I believe that.	Muňa ynanýaryn.
It took a while.	Biraz aldy.

It takes two things.	Munuň üçin iki zat gerek.
Why here?	Näme üçin bu ýerde?

I want it from me.	Men muny menden isleýärin.
He has to be somewhere.	Ol şu ýerde bir ýerde bolmaly.
Why?	Näme üçin?
There is something else.	Başga bir zat bar.
I don't think this will happen anytime soon.	Bu ýakyn wagtda bolar öýdemok.
No one paid much attention to him.	Hiç kim oňa beýle üns bermedi.
This can be very interesting.	Bu gaty gyzykly bolup biler.
Nothing serious.	Hiç zat çynlakaý däl.
He was surprised.	Ol geň galdy.

There are several reasons for this.	Munuň birnäçe sebäbi bar.
There is a problem here.	Bu ýerde bir mesele bar.
The two are completely different.	Iki düýbünden başga zat.
No one could do that.	Bu işi hiç kim edip bilmedi.
Mom? 	Bu?
This is really you.	Bu hakykatdanam sen.
"It's good," he said.	Ol: "Gowy" diýdi.
There is no reason for him to destroy himself.	Özüni hem ýok etmegine hiç hili sebäp ýok.

He wondered what had happened.	Näme boldy diýip pikir etdi.
It doesn't have to be that way.	Bu onuň bolmaly däl.
We will never know why he did that.	Näme üçin beýle etdi, biz hiç haçan bilmeris.
There is another reason.	Başga bir sebäp bar.
Knowing something is not his job, just be clear.	Bir zady bilmek onuň işi däl, diňe aýdyň.
I thought a lot about you.	Men sen hakda köp pikir etdim.
He was well aware of this.	Ol muny gowy bilýärdi.
He did it, he did a wonderful job.	Ol şeýle etdi, ajaýyp iş etdi.

I was just not surprised.	Men diňe geň görmedim.
I allowed that.	Men muňa ýol berdim.
He didn't even let us.	Hatda bize mümkinçilik bermedi.

He was alone here.	Ol bu ýerde ýeke boldy.
They are faster than you.	Olar senden has çalt.
It really helped me.	Bu hakykatdanam maňa kömek etdi.
He doesn’t want to think either.	Ol hem pikir etmek islemeýär.
I don't think that's enough.	Bu ýeterlik däl diýip pikir edýärin.
He was never home.	Ol öýde hiç wagt ýokdy.
What is everyone.	Hemmeler näme.
He is gone.	Ol gitdi.
Not surprisingly, there is no answer.	Geň däl, jogap ýok.
I just can't do it	Diňe edip bilenok
There is no time to do anything about it.	Bu hakda hiç zat etmäge wagt ýok.
What makes you	Seni näme edýär.
It was bad.	Bu erbet boldy.
