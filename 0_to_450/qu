He’s too good not to be.	Payqa ancha allinmi mana kananpaq.
Do the same thing.	Chaynata ruway.

But you are a human being.	Ichaqa qamqa runam kanki.
He had no idea where.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu maypi chayta.

I don't know what's wrong.	Manam yachanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I’m sorry, but I’m not.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa manan.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.

It was a morning like this.	Kay hina paqarinmi karqa.
Angry was good.	Phiñasqa allin kasqa.
Now that’s great.	Kunanqa chayqa ancha allinmi.
I want to be with him more.	Astawan paywan kayta munani.
But the process continues.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa hinallam kachkan.
It was last year.	Qayna wata karqan.
It was a lonely one.	Chayqa sapallanmi karqa.
This or nothing.	Kay icha mana ima.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
They are safe.	Paykunaqa segurom kanku.
Nothing was right.	Manam imapas allinchu karqa.
But don’t let that matter.	Ichaqa ama chaytaqa imananpaschu.

That would certainly work.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin allinta ruwanman.
That’s it.	Chayqa.
You’re probably thinking.	Yaqapaschá yuyaykunki.
Hopefully it will happen soon.	Munaymanmi chaylla pasananta.
Do the right thing.	Chayta ruway.
One day I want to be that person.	Huk punchawmi chay runa kayta munani.
But it is not easy to do so.	Ichaqa manan facilchu chayta ruwayqa.
But not much longer.	Ichaqa manan aswan unaytachu.
What was the wrong thing?	¿Imataq mana allinchu karqa?
Now I know what it is.	Kunanmi yachani ima kasqanmanta.
Why do you want to do this?	¿Imanasqataq kayta ruwayta munanki?
The truth of the matter.	Chiqap kaq.
Yes, it’s beautiful.	Arí, sumaqmi.
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
I want to tell you this.	Kayta willayta munani.
You knew that.	Chaytaqa yacharqanki.
You can’t tell.	Manam yachayta atiwaqchu.

But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
I know it is important.	Yachanim ancha allin kasqanmanta.
But it can’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
He was never here.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kaypichu karqan.

He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
It would be a bad thing to do.	Mana allinchu kanman chay ruwayqa.
It didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu karqa.
He didn’t do much of anything.	Payqa manan anchatachu imatapas ruwarqan.
That wouldn’t be a bad thing.	Chayqa manan mana allinchu kanman.
But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
But he knows he can’t.	Ichaqa yachanmi mana atisqanmanta.
This was a wonderful experience.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I wanted to deal with this as a person.	Kaytaqa runa hinam atipayta munarqani.
I mean a lot of things.	Anchatam niyta munani.
Today was much better.	Kunan punchawqa aswan allinmi karqa.

But, it’s okay.	Ichaqa, allinmi.
But he can’t.	Ichaqa manan atinchu.
It looks beautiful.	Sumaq rikchakun.

But no I don’t know what I am.	Ichaqa manan manan yachanichu imachus kasqayta.
It’s not that bad.	Mana chayna mana allinchu.
I’m glad he did something at home.	Kusikuni wasinpi imatapas ruwasqanmanta.
To do that, you’re right.	Chayta ruwanaykipaq.
You know, always.	Yachanki, sapa kuti.
But! 	Ichaqa!
I wasn’t happy at all.	Manam imapipas kusisqachu karqani.
He doesn’t want to go.	Payqa manam riyta munanchu.
I was really excited to do it.	Chiqaptam kusisqa karqani chayta ruwanaypaq.

He kept going.	Payqa hinallam rirqa.
She was glad he didn’t.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
No, it wasn’t anyone.	Manan, pipas karqan.
It’s probably pretty good.	Yaqapaschá ancha allin.
She says no one likes her.	Payqa ninmi mana pipas gustasqanmanta.
You can’t beat it.	Mana atipayta atiwaqchu.
Otherwise it will fail.	Mana chayqa mana allintachu ruwanqa.
You can’t tell anyone.	Manam pimanpas willayta atiwaqchu.
It’s been two days.	Iskay punchawmi.
I didn’t think about anything.	Manam imapipas piensarqanichu.
He didn’t know how many there were.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu hayk’a kasqanmantaqa.

The greatest man.	Aswan hatun runa.
He really isn’t sure he can do this.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana segurochu kashan kayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.

It’s okay if you don’t want to talk.	Mana rimayta munaspaqa allinmi.

That’s fine with me.	Chayqa allinmi ñuqawanqa.

You’re a very good guy.	Ancha allinmi kanki.
He seemed sad, almost sad.	Payqa llakisqa hinam karqa, yaqa llakisqa hinam karqa.
He was very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa kasqa.

She thought maybe it was the man.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi ichapas chay runa kanman nispa.

I never knew it.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu.
That wasn’t exactly a good thing.	Chayqa manan allintachu allin karqan.
That doesn't mean that.	Chayqa manam chayna niyta munanchu.
It didn’t seem right.	Manam allinchu rikchakurqa.

I almost did it.	Yaqapaschá ruwarqani.
Do whatever you can.	Imapas atisqaykita ruway.
Every person every day.	Sapa runa sapa punchaw.
You need to do this quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwanayki.
He continued to do so.	Hinallam ruwarqa.
What would be wrong with it.	Imataq mana allin kanman.
No one has anything.	Manan pipas imapas kanchu.
He thought that would be wrong.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chay ruwayqa mana allinchu kananta.

You can’t get any bigger than this.	Manan kaymanta aswan hatun kayta atiwaqchu.

Probably never, actually.	Yaqapaschá mana haykapipas, chiqaptaqa.
You have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki.
That wouldn’t have been easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanman karqan.
He was in the morning.	Payqa paqarinmi karqa.
He seemed very frightened.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa hinam karqa.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
I'm asking.	Tapukuni.
I never wanted to, you know.	Manam haykapipas munarqanichu, yachanki.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.

He said it quickly.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan nisqa.
That's good about it.	Allinmi chaymantaqa.

The happy thing.	Kusisqa kaq.
It was obvious why.	Sut’inmi karqan imarayku.
I know what that is like.	Yachanim chay imayna kasqanmanta.
That was not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanan karqan.
But really, there's nothing wrong with it.	Ichaqa chiqaptaqa, manam imapas mana allinchu.
That was a long time ago.	Chayqa unayñan kasharqan.
No, nothing like that.	Manan, manan imapas chay hinachu.
He was injured.	Payqa k’irisqa kasharqan.
What is this? 	¿Imataq kay?
I want to go.	Riyta munani.
But about this.	Ichaqa kaymanta.
It’s not there anymore.	Manañam kachkan.
You were really good.	Chiqaptam allin karqanki.
But he had to do it.	Ichaqa chayta ruwanan karqan.
It’s not that simple.	Manan chay hina facilchu.
He was right, you know.	Payqa allintam nirqa, yachanki.
This was almost always the case.	Chayqa yaqa sapa kutim karqa.
Tonight, it was a wonderful night to say the least.	Kunan tuta, ancha sumaq tuta karqan niyta.
But he’s the one.	Ichaqa payqa.
I’m the same.	Ñuqapas kani.
He was a human being.	Payqa runam karqa.
That doesn’t mean that.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu.
He refused to help her.	Payqa manan yanapayta munarqanchu.
I'm sure it will be.	Seguro kani kanqa.
But to do that, he has to do it right.	Ichaqa chayta ruwananpaqqa allintan ruwanan.
Maybe he should have done it.	Ichapas payqa ruwanan karqa.
I didn’t know you were here.	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi kasqaykita.
This was a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi karqa.
Everyone wants to play.	Tukuy runa pukllayta munan.
He seems to be fine.	Payqa allinmi rikchakun.
This was a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi karqa.
This approach is good on its own.	Kay ruwayqa sapallanmi allin.
Make a game of it.	Huk pukllayta ruway.
You think you can do anything!.	¡Imatapas ruwayta atisqaykita yuyanki!.
How long will this last?	¿Hayk’a tiempon kayqa kanqa?

You’ll find out soon enough.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan yachanki.
He never knew.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu.
He can't help it.	Mana yanapayta atinchu.
It must be bad for me to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqqa mana allinmi kanan.
He was very curious about everything.	Payqa anchatam munarqa tukuy imata yachayta.
Yes, he is fine.	Arí, payqa allinmi kachkan.
Now for a while.	Kunanqa huk tiempo.
But he couldn't be sure.	Ichaqa manan seguro kayta atirqanchu.
But what will it be like?.	Ichaqa, ¿imaynataq kanqa?.
I really don't know why.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
Like anyone else.	Pipas hina.
They’re both tired.	Iskayninkum sayk’usqa kachkanku.
I don't really mean it.	Mana chiqaptachu niyta munani.
Something else went wrong.	Huk imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
I just didn’t know what to do.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta.

He likes it a lot.	Payqa anchatam gustan.

But no one could do better.	Ichaqa manan pipas aswan allinta ruwayta atirqanchu.
He declined to say why.	Payqa manan munarqanchu imarayku chayta niyta.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.

What was the wrong thing?	¿Imataq mana allinchu karqa?
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
I had to do it right.	Allintam ruwanay karqa.
That’s something I don’t know for sure.	Chayqa manan allintachu yachani.
That’s how we are.	Chayna kanchik.
Perhaps that was the case.	Yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
But he knows it.	Ichaqa yachanmi.
Me and me and me and me.	Ñuqapas ñuqapas ñuqapas ñuqapas.
But now, there is nothing.	Ichaqa kunanqa, manan imapas kanchu.
If that’s what you want.	Sichus chayta munanki chayqa.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munanichu.
It will always be there.	Sapa kutim kanqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I'd rather not linger here.	Aswan allinmi kanman kaypi mana unaytachu.
No, you really should.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanayki.
But no one knows how many there are.	Ichaqa manan pipas yachanchu hayk’a kasqanmantaqa.
I’m good at this.	Kaypiqa allinmi kani.
I couldn't figure out what was going on.	Manam atirqanichu chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta.
But that was a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi karqan.
That's not such a bad thing.	Chayqa manam chayna mana allinchu.
Why does he look so sad?	¿Imanasqataq chayna llakisqa rikchakun?
He's badly injured.	Payqa sinchitan k'irisqa kashan.
Everything is excellent.	Tukuy imapas ancha allinmi.
Do your best to do it.	Tukuy atisqaykita ruway.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
It doesn’t matter that.	Chaytaqa manam imananpaschu.
She would rather be alone than unhappy.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman sapallan kay mana kusisqa kasqanmantaqa.
This isn't great, but it's better.	Kayqa manam ancha allinchu, ichaqa aswan allinmi.
He couldn’t believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
It won’t be a good one.	Manam allinchu kanqa.
All night, really.	Tukuy tuta, chiqap.
He is a double-edged sword.	Payqa iskay runam.
I thought it had to be here.	Yuyarqanim kaypi kanan kasqanmanta.
As before, as before.	Ñawpaq hina.
That would do the trick.	Chayqa allintam ruwanman.

I don’t know what’s good.	Manam yachanichu ima allin kasqanmanta.
That’s what you need to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki.
This is going to be interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi kanqa.
And he was with her.	Hinan payqa paywan kasharqan.
But he didn’t want to do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanchu.
I doubt it, but maybe.	Iskayrayani, ichaqa ichapas.
Everyone was like that.	Tukuy runa imayna kasqa.
You just can't say anything, you know?	Qamqa manam imatapas niyta atiwaqchu, ¿yachankichu?

Now was the time.	Kunanmi chay tiempo karqan.
It was like day and night.	Tuta punchaw hinam karqa.

This was now.	Kayqa kunanmi karqan.
Two reasons for, you know, what happened.	Iskay imarayku, yachanki, imachus pasasqanmanta.
He didn't want her to do that.	Payqa manan munarqanchu chayta ruwananta.
First of all, it doesn’t exist.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan kanchu.
But it’s not easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu.
But this is not really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu kayqa.
Maybe that’s what it should be.	Ichapas chayna kanan hina kanman.
That was supposed to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanan karqa.
I didn’t know what happened.	Manam yacharqanichu ima pasasqanmanta.
You can never win.	Manan hayk’aqpas atipayta atiwaqchu.
I know that it is.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta.
He knew he had to do something.	Payqa yacharqanmi imatapas ruwananta.
He doesn't seem right.	Payqa manam allinchu rikchakun.

Something told me he was there.	Imapas niwarqa chaypi kasqanmanta.
He had to continue.	Payqa hinallam kanan karqa.
But that was not the case before that time.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan chay tiempo ñawpaqtaqa.
I’m sorry about this.	Kaymanta llakikuni.

It should get the job done.	Chayqa chay llamkayta ruwananpaqmi kanan.
I really want that.	Chaytaqa anchatam munani.
I’m going to go now.	Kunanqa risaq.
Something is wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
Do it with him.	Paywan ruway.
It wouldn’t be a good thing.	Mana allinchu kanman.
That may or may not be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman, manapaschá allinchu kanman.
We are not that good.	Manam chayna allinchu kanchik.
What’s the possibility.	Imataq kanman.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa.
But it wasn’t that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu karqan.
It was a good day.	Allin punchawmi karqa.
You really were.	Chiqaptam karqanki.
You were with me all day.	Tukuy punchawmi ñuqawan karqanki.
He was a very tough guy.	Payqa ancha sinchi runam karqa.

But he knew what he could do.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi ima ruway atisqanmanta.
He knows he can.	Payqa yachanmi atisqanmanta.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu kanman.
I hope no one gets hurt.	Suyachkani mana pipas k’irisqa kananta.
I don’t think you can do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta atiwaqchu, nispan yuyaykuni.
I can’t tell you anymore.	Manañam willayta atiymanchu.
That doesn’t matter now.	Chayqa manan kunanqa imananpaschu.

Can you do something else?	¿Atiwaqchu huk ruwayta?
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
I’ll do it again.	Hukmanta ruwasaq.
I don’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachanichu.
I had no idea how he would do it.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imayna ruwananta.
It would have been nice.	Sumaqmi kanman karqa.
He doesn’t know anything about anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas imatapas yachanchu.
But first of all.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa.
But it was good.	Ichaqa allinmi kasqa.
I’ll do something like that.	Chayna imatapas ruwasaq.
Obviously it wasn’t good.	Sut’inmi mana allinchu karqan.
It must be a human being.	Huk runam kanan.
But he wanted to know more.	Ichaqa astawan yachayta munarqa.
I can't tell you now.	Kunanqa manam willayta atiymanchu.
That wouldn’t be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanman.
I don’t know if that’s good for you.	Mana yachanichu chay qampaq allinchu icha manachu chayta.

He didn’t know he would.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chayta ruwananta.

That seems to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi rikchakun.
More than that.	Aswan chaymanta.
I mean, hard.	Niyta munani, sinchi.
He is still there.	Payqa hinallam kachkan.

But it was never going to be very good.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas ancha allinchu kanan karqan.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.

He certainly does.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
As if tired,	Sayk’usqa hina, .
She could tell he was angry.	Payqa repararqanmi phiñasqa kashasqanmanta.
I think he was very scared.	Yuyaykuni ancha mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
He wanted to do it.	Payqa ruwayta munarqa.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
That was probably the case.	Chayqa yaqapaschá karqan.
Why should it be so?	¿Imanasqataq chayna kanan.

Of course, this is not easy.	Arí, kayqa manam facilchu.

Yes, you are right there.	Arí, allintam chaypi kachkanki.
He was supposed to be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanan karqa.
I couldn’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu.
The process did not work.	Chay ruwayqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
He never wanted to do that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanchu.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.

That’s what it looked like.	Chayqa rikchakurqa.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.

Everything is too good.	Tukuy imapas llumpay allinmi.
He’ll be here.	Payqa kaypi kanqa.
But that’s a big if.	Ichaqa chayqa hatun sichus.
Maybe it doesn’t matter.	Ichapas manam imananpaschu.
I don't think he really will.	Manam piensanichu chiqaptapuni chayta ruwanqa.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
No, it’s not yet.	Manan, manaraqmi.
I'll do that.	Chaytaqa ruwasaq.
Now it’s there.	Kunanqa chaypi kachkan.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
But that is not the best way to do it.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa aswan allinchu.
But now it doesn't matter.	Kunanqa ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
Very quickly.	Ancha utqaylla.

He was truly the nicest person.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin aswan sumaq runa karqan.

He didn’t do it right.	Manam allintachu ruwarqa.

He says he’s right.	Payqa ninmi.
He was so angry.	Payqa chayna phiñasqa kasqa.

This is obviously wrong.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.

I really don’t want to know.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachayta munanichu.
But he doesn’t want to.	Ichaqa manan munanchu.
I guess that would be up to me.	Chayqa ñuqamanta kanman, nispaymi.
No really means no.	Mana chiqaptam mana niyta munan.
It’s obvious.	Sut’inmi.
Maybe he can do something.	Ichapas imatapas ruwanman.
He’s not as good as he used to be.	Payqa manan ñawpaq hinachu allin.
That was the reason.	Chayqa karqan imarayku.
I don’t want to say that, this means.	Manam munanichu chay niyta, kay niyta munan.

He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
I think that’s a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi nispan yuyaykuni.

Perhaps he was.	Ichapas payqa karqa.
I think he meant it wasn't.	Yuyaykuni mana chayna kasqanmantam niyta munarqa.
He didn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
It doesn’t mean anything.	Mana imatapas niyta munanchu.
She could tell he was nervous.	Payqa repararqanmi mancharisqa kashasqanmanta.
This is not easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
This is really bad.	Kayqa chiqap mana allinmi.

I knew what he was going to do.	Yacharqanim ima ruwananta.
Maybe not though.	Ichapas mana ichaqa.
He would have been here.	Payqa kaypi kanman karqan.
That would be really bad.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin mana allin kanman.
Now, he knew he would.	Kunanqa, yacharqanmi chayta ruwananta.
The day could have been worse.	Chay punchawqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqa.
Maybe there is nothing here.	Ichapas mana imapas kaypichu kachkan.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
It’s going to be good.	Allinmi kanqa.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
But, you know, that’s okay.	Ichaqa, yachanki, chayqa allinmi.
Now it's like he's never been there.	Kunanqa mana hayk'aqpas chaypi kaq hinam.

He knew he could do it alone.	Payqa yacharqanmi sapallan chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.

I’m excited too.	Ñuqapas kusisqam kachkani.
This was not going to be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanan karqa.
Something like that.	Imapas chayna.
You know a lot about it.	Anchatam yachanki.
He knew where he was.	Payqa yacharqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
You want to go.	Riyta munanki.
Now it’s more than ever.	Kunanqa aswan ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
Pretend it doesn’t exist.	Mana kasqanmanta hina ruway.

He wasn't sure what he wanted to do.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan ima ruway munasqanmanta.

I didn’t want to know if he could do it.	Manam yachayta munarqanichu chayta ruwayta atinmanchu icha manachu chayta.
I didn’t mean it.	Manam ñuqaqa niyta munarqanichu.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
Indeed, he was.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa karqan.
I said it didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu nispaymi nirqani.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
I wonder what he’s thinking.	Tapukuni ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
He is not quite here.	Payqa manam allintachu kaypi kachkan.
No, he wasn’t like that.	Manan, payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.

It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.

I don’t really know why though.	Manam yachanichu chiqaptapuni imarayku ichaqa.
She knew what he was thinking.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
That should be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanan.

If that’s what you want.	Sichus chayta munanki chayqa.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
I wonder what that looks like.	Imaynataq chay kasqanmanta tapukuni.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
Something wasn’t right.	Imapas manam allinchu karqa.
It looks new.	Musuq rikchakun.
I am something else.	Ñuqaqa huk imapas kani.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
I don’t care about anything.	Mana imamanta llakikuni.
No, he doesn’t.	Manan, payqa manan.
We’re very, very nice.	Ancha, ancha sumaqmi kayku.
He told me he was scared.	Niwarqa mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
I'm not sure it will.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kananta.
You will have to do everything.	Tukuy imatam ruwanayki kanqa.
You are beautiful.	Sumaqmi kanki.
Other than that, this does.	Huk chaymanta, kay ruwan.
Perhaps that was the case.	Yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
No one can do it!.	¡Manan pipas atinmanchu!.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kasqa.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I’m glad that’s the case.	Kusikuni chayna kasqanmanta.
He knows he can never win.	Payqa yachanmi mana hayk’aqpas atipayta atisqanmanta.
I can't do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwaymanchu.
No, he certainly was.	Manan, payqa cheqaqtapunin karqan.

He told me.	Niwarqa.
She knew what he was thinking.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
What would happen if.	¿Imataq kanman sichus.
Someone has to do that.	Pipas chayta ruwanan tiyan.
He is happy about something.	Payqa imamantapas kusisqam kachkan.
It was so much more interesting.	Ancha aswan sumaqmi karqa.
I think it was there.	Chaypi kasqanmantam piensani.
Of course,.	Riki,.
You’ve never done it before.	Mana hayk’aqpas ruwasqaykita.
He’ll be fine though.	Payqa allinmi kanqa ichaqa.
But he had no idea where he was.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
He declined to disclose his injuries.	Payqa manan k’irisqa kasqanmanta willayta munarqanchu.
Sure, everything would be fine.	Seguro, tukuy imapas allinmi kanman.
There was one man, however.	Huk runan ichaqa karqan.
I don't know how many days it was.	Mana yachanichu hayka punchaw kasqanmanta.
This was really nice.	Kayqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa.

He didn’t seem nervous at all.	Payqa manan imapipas mancharisqa hinachu karqan.
I said he was gone.	Manañam kachkan nispaymi nirqani.

That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
She’s really nice.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi.
I did something.	Imatapas ruwarqani.
You wouldn’t want to be there.	Manam chaypi kaytaqa munawaqchu.
What a beautiful thing for you.	Ima sumaqmi qampaq.
I didn’t want to believe that.	Chaytaqa manam creeyta munarqanichu.
This is neither good nor bad.	Kayqa manam allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
I don't want this to ever happen.	Manam munanichu kay haykapipas pasananta.
Maybe there was something there.	Ichapas chaypi imapas karqa.
It was really really hard.	Chiqaptam chiqap sasa karqa.
I was very much in the mood.	Anchatam karqani.
But that wouldn’t last very long.	Ichaqa manan ancha unaytachu chayqa kanman karqan.
I didn't do much more than that.	Manam chaymantaqa aswan achkatam ruwarqani.
He could never tell her.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa willayta atirqanchu.
I want.	Munani.
Indeed, he did.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
Maybe he did just that.	Ichapas payqa chayta ruwarqa.
New.	Musuq.
But probably not for long.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana unaytachu.
That’s not going to be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
But it was very clear.	Ichaqa ancha sut’inmi karqan.
I don’t want to know.	Manam yachayta munanichu.
I still don't know what it was like.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmanta.
I just couldn’t do it.	Chaylla mana ruwayta atirqanichu.
That might do the trick.	Chayqa ichapas chayta ruwanman.
Maybe that was a good thing.	Ichapas chayqa allin karqa.
He says it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim chaytaqa nin.
He’s pretty good.	Payqa allin allinmi.
Not sure if it is.	Mana segurochu kanchu sichus chayna kasqanmanta.
He had to be quick.	Payqa usqhayllan kanan karqan.
Do this one step at a time.	Chaytaqa hukmanta hukmanta ruway.
I know it doesn't really matter.	Yachanim mana chiqaptachu imapas kasqanmanta.
Things are not that simple.	Imapas manam chayna facilchu.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi kanman.
I am happier now.	Kunanqa aswan kusisqam kachkani.
That means, it’s better.	Chay niyta munan, aswan allinmi.
He would rather be someone else.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman huk runa kay.
I don’t want to do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwayta munanichu.
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Manam chaytaqa imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.
You probably won’t do it right.	Yaqapaschá mana allintachu ruwanki.
I was here.	Kaypi karqani.

Yes, that’s a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi.

Don't you think it's better for you.	¿Manachu yuyanki aswan allin kananpaq qampaq.
Nothing has to go wrong.	Manan imapas mana allinchu kanan.

You want to.	Munanki.
He couldn’t believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
Nothing always, nothing really.	Mana imapas sapa kuti, mana imapas chiqap.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
He wanted to do everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam ruwayta munarqa.
He says that's not the case here.	Payqa ninmi kaypiqa mana chayna kasqanmanta.
You think about something.	Imapipas yuyaykunki.
I knew he would be happy.	Yacharqanim kusisqa kananta.
That’s very much.	Chayqa ancha ancha.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
He probably was.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
He said yes to it.	Payqa arí nisqa.

Just to be sure.	Chaylla seguro kananpaq.
I don’t know what it’s like.	Manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmantaqa.

But it will be good.	Ichaqa allinmi kanqa.
They are very beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanku.
But that will be next week.	Ichaqa chayqa hamuq semanan kanqa.
I didn’t want to say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta munarqanichu.
Maybe it’s much, much bigger.	Ichapas aswan, aswan hatun kanman.
I thought that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Man, it was beautiful.	Runa, sumaqmi karqa.
He was right though.	Payqa allintam ichaqa nirqa.
That was it.	Chayqa karqa.
But, no one knows what will happen.	Ichaqa, manan pipas yachanchu imachus pasananta.
I don’t want to.	Manam munanichu.
It won’t do well!	¡Manan allintachu ruwanqa!
That’s been there for a long time.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi kachkan.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But there is nothing.	Ichaqa manan imapas kanchu.
He actually looks great.	Payqa chiqaptaqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.

He knows you are here.	Payqa yachanmi kaypi kasqaykita.
He wanted to know everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yachayta munarqa.
Nothing else about it.	Mana imapas chaymantaqa.
Otherwise it would be fine.	Mana chayqa allinmi kanman.
He was there, now.	Payqa chaypi kasqa, kunanqa.
It has to be that way.	Chayna kanan tiyan.
But things remained the same.	Ichaqa imapas hinallam karqa.
Maybe he did everything.	Ichapas payqa tukuy imatapas ruwarqa.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
He didn’t mean it.	Payqa manan chayta niyta munarqanchu.
That’s the only thing.	Chayqa sapallanmi.
You never live with me.	Manam haykapipas ñuqawanqa yachankichu.
He was extremely lonely.	Payqa sinchi sapallanmi kasharqan.
It doesn’t mean it’s good.	Mana allinchu niyta munan.

He certainly said that.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta nirqan.
He couldn’t speak.	Payqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
I knew that was the case.	Yacharqanim chayna kasqanmanta.
Why would he do that?	¿Imanasqataq chaynata ruwanman karqa.
It wouldn’t have been right.	Manan allinchu kanman karqan.
More often than not.	Aswan sapa kuti.

He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi kasqa.

If you have to do it.	Sichus ruwanayki kanqa chayqa.
The difficult thing.	Sasa kaq.
It certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
You want to report action.	Ruway willayta munanki.
You are there today.	Kunan punchawmi chaypi kachkanki.
He can't talk for long.	Mana unayta rimayta atinchu.
This process is very important.	Kay ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
He can’t do it.	Manan ruwayta atinchu.
She is scared and worried.	Payqa mancharisqa, llakisqa ima kachkan.
Like, really great.	Imayna, chiqap hatun.
I was okay with it.	Allinmi karqani.
But he is not happy.	Ichaqa manan kusisqachu.
Maybe more time.	Ichapas aswan tiempo.
I don’t really like it.	Manam anchatachu gustan.
That doesn’t mean anything.	Chayqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu.
But, one day, it will be.	Ichaqa, huk punchawmi, kanqa.
Like today.	Kunan hina.
I know what that is like.	Yachanim chay imayna kasqanmanta.
Never knew before.	Mana hayk’aqpas ñawpaqtaqa yacharqanchu.
Everything else.	Tukuy ima.
Where he was supposed to be, what he was supposed to do.	Maypi kanan karqa, ima ruwanan karqa.
Very often, he meant this.	Ancha sapa kuti, payqa kayta niyta munarqa.
Nobody wants to.	Manan pipas munanchu.
It’s not really.	Manam chiqaptachu.
Great day.	Hatun punchaw.
He was that good.	Payqa chayna allinmi karqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
It was more interesting.	Aswan sumaqmi karqa.
Sure, they’re yours.	Seguro, paykunaqa qanpa kanku.
He knew that it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayna kasqanmanta.
Being quick.	Chaylla kay.
It depends on what works for you.	Chayqa imapas qampaq allin kasqanmantam.
They are doing well.	Allinmi kachkanku.
Who did that? 	¿Pitaq chayta ruwarqa?
I don’t really know how or why it happened.	Manam allintachu yachani imayna pasasqanmanta nitaq imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
I think he can.	Yuyaykuni atisqanmanta.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
Now he knew he was doing the right thing.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi allinta ruwasqanmanta.
Everyone is happy.	Lliwmi kusisqa kachkanku.
I never wanted that to happen.	Manam haykapipas munarqanichu chayna kananta.
It’s a new day.	Musuq punchawmi.
I’m not a good guy.	Manam allinchu kani.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
He knows what’s going on.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I know where he is.	Yachanim maypi kasqanmanta.
It doesn't seem right.	Mana allintachu rikchakun.
I don’t want to say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta munanichu.
I know you are busy.	Yachanim ocupasqa kasqaykita.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
I didn’t want to.	Manam munarqanichu.
It was never going to be good.	Manam haykapipas allinchu kanan karqa.
But that wasn’t the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa allinchu karqan.
I don’t really know.	Manam chiqaptaqa yachanichu.
It couldn’t have been any other way.	Manan huk hinachu kanman karqan.
He does this all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwan.
It was never good enough.	Manam haykapipas allinchu karqa.
I don’t know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa.
But someone had to do it.	Ichaqa pipas chayta ruwanan karqan.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
Art.	Sumaq ruway.
I'll be fine.	Allinmi kasaq.
I'll do very well, now.	Ancha allintam ruwasaq, kunan.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu.
There was a man.	Huk runam karqa.
He’s not happy.	Manam kusisqachu.
I'm not so sure that's the case.	Manam chayna segurochu kani chayna kasqanmantaqa.
You have to do this.	Kayta ruwanayki tiyan.
It may not be a good idea.	Manapaschá allinchu kanman.
That’s all.	Chaylla.
But then who knows.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa, ¿pitaq yachan.
Now  .	Kunan .
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I wonder about that.	Chayta tapukuni.
You don’t know anything about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yachankichu.
I'm really excited, actually.	Chiqaptam kusisqa kachkani, chiqaptaqa.
It was a long time ago.	Unayñan ñawpaqtaqa.
Where ever ?.	Maypitaq haykapipas ?.
I thought that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He seemed a little nervous.	Payqa huk chikan mancharisqa hinam karqa.
He doesn’t want to talk to me.	Payqa manan munanchu ñoqawan rimayta.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I really meant it too.	Ñuqapas chiqaptam chaytaqa niyta munarqani.
Don't be too sure though.	Ama ancha segurochu ichaqa.
But something was wrong.	Ichaqa imapas mana allinchu karqa.
It won't work here.	Kaypiqa manam allinchu kanqa.
That’s what she said he said.	Chaytan payqa nisqa payqa nisqa.
Not sure why.	Mana segurochu imarayku.
I can't work it out.	Manam llamk'ayta atiymanchu.
Is it a good idea to do that?.	¿Allinchu chay ruwayqa kanman?.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
I can’t do it.	Manam atiymanchu.
He wasn’t like he was last week.	Payqa manan qayna semana hinachu karqan.
She looked so nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
She’s really nice.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi.
I thought it was great.	Ñuqaqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensarqani.
Maybe a little too much.	Ichapas huk chikan llumpayta.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I’ll do that if I want to.	Chaytaqa ruwasaq munaspaqa.
But this really doesn’t mean much.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin kayqa manan anchatachu niyta munan.
I'm sure that	Seguro kani chay

Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu.

I'll keep doing it.	Hinallam ruwasaq.
I want to be beautiful.	Munani sumaq kayta.
This is not a bad thing.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu.

She was so beautiful now.	Payqa kunanqa ancha sumaqmi kasqa.
I thought nothing of it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu.

But obviously you should.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwanayki.
I wasn’t happy about it.	Manam chaymantaqa kusisqachu karqani.
He never wanted that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa munarqanchu.
Maybe.	Icha.
I could never know.	Manam haykapipas yachayta atirqanichu.
I'm a human being.	Runa kani.
I don't care how bad it is.	Manam imananpaschu imayna mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
I didn’t want to.	Manam munarqanichu.
Things could be worse.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman imapas.
Everything is wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allinchu.
That’s probably it.	Chayqa yaqapaschá.
You can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
It’s not really bad.	Manam chiqap mana allinchu.
I'm not so sure about everything.	Manam chayna segurochu kani tukuy imamanta.
He doesn’t want to come.	Payqa manam hamuyta munanchu.
That was always there.	Chayqa sapa kutim chaypi karqa.
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.
I can’t speak anymore.	Manañam rimayta atinichu.
It doesn’t mean you’re not good enough.	Manam niyta munanchu mana allinchu kasqaykita.
He doesn’t know that.	Payqa manan yachanchu chaytaqa.
It will be strong.	Sinchi kanqa.
Now it doesn’t matter.	Kunanqa manan imananpaschu.
I don’t really want to talk about it.	Manam anchatachu chaymanta rimayta munani.
Then this.	Chaymanta kay.
I'm really looking forward to this.	Kaytaqa anchatam suyachkani.
I didn’t really do much.	Manam chiqaptaqa anchatachu ruwarqani.
That was very clear.	Chayqa ancha sut’inmi karqan.
The coffee is excellent.	Chay kukata ancha allinmi.
I’m afraid that’s not the case.	Manchakuni mana chayna kasqanmanta.
I’m not very good at it.	Manam ancha allinchu kani.
She’s making coffee.	Payqa kukata ruwachkan.
Have a nice day.	Qampaq allin punchaw.
I meant to say that.	Chayta niyta munarqani.

He was, he was.	Payqa karqan, payqa.
Everyone is worried.	Lliwmi llakisqa kachkanku.
I’ll be fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kasaq.
That’s a very bad thing.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi.
He is here today.	Kunanmi kaypi kachkan.
It was a beautiful day.	Chay punchawqa sumaqmi karqa.
But I don’t know.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu.
This is very obvious.	Kayqa ancha sut’inmi.
Don’t pretend anyone ever did.	Ama hayk’aqpas pipas chayta ruwaq hinachu.
He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manan atirqanchu.
I don’t know how to do that.	Manam chayta ruwayta yachanichu.
I can’t really say yet.	Manaraqmi chiqaptaqa niyta atiymanchu.
He knew nothing of what had happened to him.	Payqa manan imatapas yacharqanchu paywan imachus pasasqanmanta.
But he didn’t exactly say no.	Ichaqa manan allintachu nirqan mana nispa.
This is either nothing.	Kayqa icha mana imapas.
This is so quick.	Kayqa chayna utqaylla.
Thirdly, the	Kimsa kaq.
But he kept saying it.	Ichaqa hinallam nirqa.
If anything.	Sichus imapas.
How long had it been.	Hayk’a unayñan karqan.
Maybe he did that.	Ichapas chayta ruwarqa.
He couldn’t have done that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
This means two things.	Kayqa iskay ima niyta munan.
But he wanted to know.	Ichaqa yachayta munarqa.
You are so beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanki.
To be successful, you have to be successful.	Allinta ruwanaykipaqqa allintam ruwanayki.
But that would be a bad thing.	Ichaqa chayqa mana allinmi kanman.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
One person was injured.	Huk runan k’irisqa karqan.
We’re so good together.	Ancha allinmi kuska kayku.
It’s like new.	Musuq hinam.
Very good for you.	Ancha allin qampaq.

This is the worst.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi.

But that’s that.	Ichaqa chay chayta.
But he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
You know, it’s really nice here.	Yachanki, kaypiqa ancha sumaqmi.
Please? 	Ama hina?
He said he wasn’t quite sure.	Payqa manan allintachu seguro kashasqanmanta nisqa.
He doesn't want to talk.	Manam rimayta munanchu.
You don’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachankichu.
Faster, faster.	Aswan utqaylla, aswan utqaylla.
He says something, she says something.	Payqa imatapas nin, payqa imatapas nin.
That’s still the case.	Chayqa hinallam kachkan.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I don’t want to be married.	Manam munanichu casarasqa kayta.
You can’t say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta atiwaqchu.
I look forward to doing that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi anchata suyachkani.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
Make what you want out of this.	Kaymanta ima munasqaykita ruway.
He always wants to play.	Payqa sapa kutim pukllayta munan.
Yes! 	Arí!
That would have been better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan.
But I don’t know for sure.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachani.
I think someone else said it better.	Yuyaykuni huk runa aswan allinta nisqa.
How do you do this?	¿Imaynatataq kayta ruwanki?
But now he was sure.	Ichaqa kunanmi seguro kasqa.
He should be happy.	Payqa kusisqam kanan.

That’s still the case.	Chayqa hinallam kachkan.
I didn’t know they were there.	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi kasqankuta.
The next day.	Paqarin punchaw.
Why would he do that?	¿Imanasqataq chayta ruwanman.
This is a human being.	Kayqa runam.
I don't know.	Manam yachanichu.
He wanted to know how you were doing.	Payqa imayna kasqaykita yachayta munarqa.
He was very frightened.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa kasqa.
It wouldn’t be right.	Manan allinchu kanman.
If all else fails, it went wrong.	Tukuy ima mana allinchu kanman chayqa, mana allintachu rirqa.
They don’t care.	Paykunaqa manan imananpaschu.
You can't come.	Manan hamuyta atiwaqchu.
That’s everything.	Chayqa tukuy imapas.
I said sure enough.	Ñuqaqa segurom nirqani.

Many, many things.	Achka, achka imakuna.
Maybe that would be a good thing.	Ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
That was too early.	Chayqa llumpay ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqa.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
Do it every morning and afternoon.	Sapa paqarin, tarde ima ruway.
Why not?	Imanasqa mana?
He is a strong man.	Payqa sinchi runam.
But he can’t.	Ichaqa manan atinchu.
Now I don't know what to do.	Kunanqa manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.

I'd rather it not happen to him.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana paywan pasananta.
But things are not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu imapas.
Like two years ago.	Iskay wata ñawpaq hina.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
You have to do something.	Imatapas ruwanayki.
He was a man of the past.	Payqa huk runam karqa.
Everything looked great.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
That’s not a bad thing.	Chayqa manan mana allinchu.
More like three.	Aswan kimsa hina.
Not too bad, really.	Mana ancha mana allinchu, chiqap.
It is not good now.	Kunanqa manam allinchu kachkan.
He was tired and sad.	Payqa sayk’usqa, llakisqa ima kasqa.
Good day.	Allin punchaw.
That doesn’t matter.	Chayqa manan imananpaschu.
How can you not.	Imaynatataq mana.
To be with him.	Paywan kuska kananpaq.
What is the characteristic?.	¿Imaynataq kanman?.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.

I don’t mean to say.	Manam niyta munani.
He went away.	Rirqa.
It was a good day.	Allin punchawmi karqa.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
This year’s bigger.	Kay wata aswan hatun.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.

After all, it wasn't that bad.	Tukuy imamanta, mana chayna mana allinchu karqa.
It’s pretty nice, actually.	Allin sumaqmi, chiqaptaqa.
Yes, that is better.	Arí, chayqa aswan allinmi.

Maybe that’s the only good thing.	Ichapas chaylla allin kaq.
I’m still there.	Ñuqaqa chaypi hinallam kachkani.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.

Every week.	Sapa semana.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
He said no, he couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan, manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu nispa.
He does it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim chayta ruwan.
He's still really angry.	Payqa kunankamapas chiqaptam phiñasqa kachkan.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.

He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
Not sure what it is.	Mana segurochu imakuna kasqanmanta.
Maybe he’s a.	Ichapas payqa huk.
It was yesterday, actually.	Qayna punchawmi karqa, chiqaptaqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He knows everything about it.	Payqa tukuy imatam chaymanta yachan.
He was probably not good enough.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu karqan.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
I'm really looking forward to that.	Chaytaqa anchatam suyachkani.
Do it right.	Allinta ruway.

Not anymore.	Manaña.
I don't know what to make of this.	Manam yachanichu kaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
He wasn't here before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam kaypichu karqa.
He was too lonely.	Payqa llumpay sapallanmi karqa.

He probably does that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwan.
I can't believe everything is going well for you.	Manam creeyta atiymanchu tukuy imapas qampaq allin kasqanmanta.
I mean, it's night and day.	Niyta munani, tuta p'unchawmi.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.

He was rather frightened.	Payqa aswan mancharisqa kasharqan.

Everyone means well, but it’s hard.	Tukuy runa allinta niyta munan, ichaqa sasa.
Something wasn’t right.	Imapas manam allinchu karqa.
Needless to say, he was terrified.	Manañam niyta munanichu mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
Of course, it wasn’t.	Arí, manan chay hinachu karqan.
Who knows where the day before.	Pitaq yachan maypi ñawpaq p’unchaw kasqanmanta.
He didn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaymantaqa munarqanchu.

Very nice indeed.	Ancha sumaq chiqap.
He will do it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwanqa.

No, it was better.	Manan, aswan allinmi karqan.
No one can do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.

No, that’s not a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu.

He's right there.	Payqa allintam chaypi kachkan.
Otherwise it will be.	Mana chayqa kanqa.

He doesn’t like it, he says.	Payqa manan gustanchu, nispan nin.

But it was very much like that.	Ichaqa anchatan chhayna karqan.
He is a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam.
I couldn’t believe it would happen.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayna pasananta.
Do that for yourself.	Chaytaqa qampaq ruway.
Do it right.	Allinta ruway.

He would have to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan kanman karqan.
I know what you can do.	Yachanim ima ruway atisqaykita.
But that’s the name.	Ichaqa chay sutinmi.
He says he knows.	Payqa yachanim nin.

He really is a great guy.	Payqa chiqaptam hatun runa.
But this would be a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi kanman.
Maybe that would be a good thing.	Ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
No, it's	Manan, chayqa .
I know that is not an easy task.	Yachanim chay ruwayqa mana facilchu kasqanmanta.
I couldn't believe it, but he was right.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu, ichaqa allintam nirqa.

Join us today!.	¡Kunan punchaw ñuqaykuwan kuska!.
It’s okay to want what you want.	Munasqaykita munaspaqa allinmi.
No one was ever sure.	Manam pipas haykapipas segurochu karqa.
What’s new.	Imataq musuq.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
I don’t want it here.	Manam kaypichu munani.
That would be better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I mean it’s pretty cool.	Niyta munani ancha sumaq kasqanmanta.
I’m always the one.	Ñuqaqa sapa kutim kani.
But no one knows for sure.	Ichaqa manan pipas cheqaqtachu yachan.
How did he say that.	Imaynataq chayta nisqa.
Never, never, never.	Mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas.
I’m actually a human being.	Chiqaptaqa runam kani.
I hope it is.	Suyachkani chayna kasqanmanta.
I thought that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He did it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwarqa.
Now, bigger and bigger.	Kunanqa, aswan hatun aswan hatun.
I don’t know how you can do help.	Mana yachanichu imayna ruwayta atiwaqchu yanapayta.
But it’s obvious.	Ichaqa sut’inmi.
Now that was the day.	Kunanqa chay punchawmi karqa.
Again, the	Hukmanta.
However, this is still important.	Ichaqa, kayqa hinallam ancha allin.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
He looked up quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan qhawarirqan.
No one can do it.	Manan pipas atinmanchu.
I don’t know where it is.	Manam yachanichu maypi kasqanmanta.
Maybe that’s the right thing to do.	Ichapas chayna allin kanman.
Yes.	Arí.
No one knows where you are.	Manan pipas yachanchu maypi kasqaykita.
What will happen, will happen.	Imataq kanqa, kanqa.
He doesn't want to talk.	Mana rimayta munanchu.
It’s never really easy.	Manam haykapipas chiqap facilchu.
He needs coffee.	Payqa kukata necesitan.
Please, man.	Ama hina kaspa, runa.
But he refused to go.	Ichaqa manan riyta munarqanchu.
But nothing worked out.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu karqan.
I knew it would be good.	Yacharqanim allin kananta.
They are completely evil.	Paykunaqa tukuy imamanta mana allin ruwaq kanku.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
But it’s difficult, very difficult.	Ichaqa sasa, ancha sasa.
It really is something.	Chiqaptam imapas.
Who is new.	Pitaq musuq.
That’s not going to be the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu kanqa.
But you’re fine.	Ichaqa allinmi kanki.
He looked up quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan qhawarirqan.
I want to make a game.	Huk pukllayta ruwayta munani.
But, then.	Ichaqa, chaymanta.
That he wouldn’t do it right.	Mana allintachu ruwananta.
I really want to talk to you.	Anchatam qamwan rimayta munani.
He was something.	Payqa imapas karqa.
It’s really bad right now.	Chiqap mana allinmi kunan.
Are you all right?' 	¿Allinchu kachkanki?’, nispa.
No, that’s something.	Manan, chayqa imapas.
But you can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atiwaqchu.
I couldn’t help it.	Mana yanapayta atirqanichu.
That, however, didn’t work.	Chayqa ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
But this was worse.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
I think he’s done well.	Yuyaykuni allinta ruwasqanmanta.
I can’t do it.	Manam atiymanchu.
What do you do?	Imatataq ruwanki?
Now it didn’t seem like anything was going to happen.	Kunanqa manan imapas kanan hinachu karqan.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
It was a very bad experience.	Ancha mana allinmi karqa.
Do you know where this is?	¿Yachankichu maypi kay kasqanmanta?
That’s as safe as it can be.	Chayqa seguro kanman hina seguro kanman.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
He was this, that, and whatever.	Payqa kay, chay, ima karqan.
You were the one.	Qamqa karqanki.
This was a wonderful day.	Kay punchawqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But it wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman.
But it was worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi karqan.
But it’s still there.	Ichaqa hinallam kachkan.
I know that it is.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta.
But if you want to.	Ichaqa munaspaqa.
But.	Ichaqa.
I'm a human being.	Runa kani.
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
I would never have done that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa.
I'll do that.	Chayta ruwasaq.
Did you know they existed.	Yacharqankichu kasqankuta.
But that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa allinmi chayqa.
Who is this guy?	¿Pitaq kay runa?
He would have loved to be here today.	Payqa anchatan munanman karqan kunan p’unchay kaypi kananpaq.
Not yet, not quite.	Manaraq, mana allintachu.
I knew what was going to happen.	Yacharqanim ima kananta.
What was it that happened.	Imataq karqa.
But certainly anything can happen.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin imapas kanman.
Almost a night.	Yaqa huk tuta.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
It’s like this.	Kay hinam.
No one knows why or how.	Manan pipas yachanchu imarayku nitaq imaynatachus chayta.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
I really want to talk.	Anchatan munani rimayta.
That’s a very bad thing.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi.
I don’t want anything.	Manam imatapas munanichu.
What! 	Ima!
Maybe he would have done that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanman karqa.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
He’s been there for a long time now.	Kunanqa unayñan chaypi kashan.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
She really wants to be with him.	Payqa anchatam munan paywan kayta.
I think you did that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwasqaykita.
You certainly do.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanki.
But everything remained the same.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas hinallam karqa.
I know you do that.	Yachanim chayta ruwasqaykita.
It would make a good game, this would.	Allin pukllayta ruwanman, kayqa ruwanman.
He is good enough to play this role.	Payqa allinmi kay ruwayta ruwananpaq.
There was nothing wrong with it.	Manam imapas mana allinchu karqa.
The best ever.	Aswan allin hayk’aqpas.
Things could have been worse.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan imapas.
Someone else did it.	Huk runam chayta ruwarqa.
Maybe a little less.	Ichapas huk chikan pisi.
It’s actually pretty interesting.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi.
Very true.	Sinchi chiqap.
I know you can't talk about it.	Yachanim chaymanta mana rimayta atisqaykita.
Everything is as it should be.	Tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam kachkan.
This looks really nice.	Kayqa chiqap sumaqmi rikchakun.
I think you've done a good job.	Allin llamk'ayta ruwasqaykita yuyani.
That is probably the best thing to do.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan allin ruwayqa kanman.
Obviously, he doesn’t need much.	Sut’inmi, payqa manan anchatachu necesitan.
This, not so much.	Kay, mana anchatachu.
He doesn't seem right.	Payqa manam allinchu rikchakun.
They had to be.	Paykunaqa kanan karqan.
Would you like to go with me?	¿Munawaqchu ñuqawan riyta?
I don’t know if anyone got hurt.	Manam yachanichu pipas k’irisqa kasqanmantaqa.
If not, well don’t.	Mana chayqa, allinmi ama.
I was sure something was wrong.	Seguro karqani imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
They are beautiful.	Paykunaqa sumaqmi kanku.
He did it as quickly as the first.	Chaytaqa ñawpaq kaq hina usqhayllan ruwarqan.
I would never do that now.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqan.
I couldn’t do it.	Manam ruwayta atirqanichu.
I mean, it couldn't be worse.	Niyta munani, manam aswan mana allinchu kanman.
He didn’t want that that after all.	Payqa manan munarqanchu chay chayta tukuy imamanta.
You can’t do that now.	Kunanqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I know where they are.	Yachanim maypi kasqankuta.
The injured one.	K’irisqa kaq.
He and she together.	Paywan paywan kuska.
But it wouldn’t be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanman karqan.
He actually said that.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta nisqa.
I have not seen this before.	Kaytaqa manam ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu.
No, no, no, no.	Mana, mana, mana.
I want to talk to him today.	Kunan punchawmi paywan rimayta munani.
But maybe it’s that good.	Ichaqa ichapas chayna allin kanman.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu.
I’m not sure yet.	Manaraqmi segurochu kani.
That is obviously wrong.	Chay ruwayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.
This didn't matter.	Kayqa manam imananpaschu karqa.
This is almost every day.	Kayqa yaqa sapa punchawmi.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
I know you are faster than me.	Yachanim ñuqamanta aswan utqaylla kasqaykita.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
He is fine now.	Payqa kunanqa allinmi kachkan.
She knew what he meant.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima niyta munasqanmanta.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.	Yacharqanim mana facilchu kanman karqa.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa.
Being human is good.	Runa kayqa allinmi.
But he probably would have.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwanman karqan.
Is that right?.	¿Allinchu chay?.
One, two, many.	Huk, iskay, achka.
First time here.	Ñawpaq kuti kaypi.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
Maybe a.	Ichapas huk.
Everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
Maybe, it looks good.	Ichapas, allinmi rikchakun.
Like, really, really.	Imayna, chiqap, chiqap kaq.
Do it quickly.	Utqaylla ruway.
One day, though.	Huk punchawmi ichaqa.
I wasn’t good either.	Ñuqapas mana allinchu karqani.
That is as it should be.	Chayqa imayna kanan hinam.
Not like this morning.	Mana kunan paqarin hinachu.
I'll do that.	Chayta ruwasaq.
It would be like that.	Chayna kanman.
That’s not easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu.
He would have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanan kanman karqan.
He did something.	Imatapas ruwarqa.
Now I think that is the case.	Kunanqa chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
Who will be the best?	¿Pitaq aswan allin kanqa?
Maybe more than that.	Ichapas aswan achka.
You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
I had a very great day.	Ancha hatun punchawmi karqani.
I think that's his name.	Chayqa sutinmi nispaymi piensani.
However, this approach does not seem to work.	Ichaqa manan kay ruwayqa allinchu rikch’akun.
That’s if you want to help.	Chayqa sichus yanapayta munanki chayqa.
You knew that very well.	Chaytaqa ancha allintam yacharqanki.
I would never have done that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa.
It would be very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi kanman.
This is important, he says.	Kayqa ancha allinmi, nispan nin.
This isn’t going to be like every other time.	Kayqa mana sapa huk kuti hinachu kanqa.
But that wouldn’t always be the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chayqa kanman karqan.
That’s what he had to do.	Chaytan ruwanan karqan.
This can be very useful.	Kayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I know what he thinks.	Yachanim ima piensasqanmanta.
She was beautiful, very beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa, ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He seems very sure.	Payqa ancha seguro hinam kachkan.
That’s going to continue.	Chayqa hinallam kanqa.
I know it was too soon.	Yachanim ancha utqaylla kasqanmanta.
It is.	Kayqa.
What a wonderful experience that was!	¡Chay ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa!
He knew what he had to do.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwanan kasqanmanta.
He was like that.	Payqa hinam karqa.
No one knows how many there are.	Manam pipas yachanchu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
I don't think this is right.	Kayqa manam allinchu kasqanmantam piensani.
He was in a deep state of distress.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan.
If you’re not happy, we’re not happy.	Mana kusisqachu kanki chayqa, manan kusisqachu kayku.
He can’t go to the gym.	Mana riyta atinchu.
If you want to contact us, that’s fine.	Sichus ñuqaykuwan rimayta munanki chayqa, allinmi.
Probably not.	Manapaschá.
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
Very happy, yes.	Ancha kusisqa, arí.
That was a man.	Chayqa huk runam karqa.
He says it went well.	Payqa allintam rirqa nin.
But who needs it.	Ichaqa pitaq necesitan.
Where we are.	Maypi kanchik.
Like, man good.	Imayna, runa allin.
He was a man of the past.	Payqa huk runam karqa.
Not maybe then.	Mana ichapas chaymanta.
It still looks great.	Kunankamapas ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
Being alone is a great thing.	Sapallan kayqa ancha allinmi.
It’s like that.	Chayman rikchakun.
Things went well.	Imapas allintam rirqa.
If you think about it.	Sichus yuyaykunki chayqa.
Probably not.	Manapaschá.
Not at all.	Mana imapipas.
I still don't know what to do.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
Something could be wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman.
I’ve done that.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani.
You may not have known that.	Manapaschá chaytaqa yacharqankichu.
More on that here.	Astawan chaymanta kaypi.
Don't like it.	Ama gustanchu.
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
That was always the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim chayna karqa.
I thought it was pretty good.	Allin allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Obviously, someone was.	Sut’inmi, pipas karqan.
It’s going to be pretty difficult.	Allin sasa kanqa.
Indeed, it was.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
I thought it was great.	Ñuqaqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensarqani.
I wish I knew what it was.	Munaymanmi ima kasqanmanta yachayta.
He was in a deep state of distress.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan.
I thought you were right.	Ñuqaqa allintam nisqaykita piensarqani.
That says something.	Chayqa imatapas ninmi.
Would you like to come?	¿Munawaqchu hamuyta?
This whole thing.	Kay tukuy ima.
What harm could it do?	¿Ima mana allintan ruwanman?
I’m not happy about anything.	Manam imamantapas kusisqachu kani.
He doesn’t like to help.	Payqa manan gustanchu yanapayta.
We’re good, we’re a lot of good.	Allinmi kayku, achka allinmi kayku.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
He didn’t know where he was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
I meant to say that.	Chaytaqa niyta munarqani.
But maybe it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa ichapas mana chayna facilchu kanman.
To make it better.	Aswan allin kananpaq.
But you know better.	Ichaqa aswan allintan yachanki.
Being truthful.	Chiqap kay.
Always.	Sapa kuti.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
I'm so sorry	Anchatam llakikuni
He doesn’t like that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa gustanchu.
He was very curious.	Payqa anchatan yachayta munarqan.
He would probably do it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanman.
It’s that good.	Chayna allinmi.
No one could believe it.	Manan pipas creeyta atirqanchu.
This was indeed a beautiful day.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa sumaq p’unchay karqan.
It just wasn’t good enough.	Chaylla mana allinchu karqa.
I'm going to go now.	Kunanmi risaq.
It’s not very good.	Mana ancha allinchu.
Someone who is good.	Pipas allin kaq.
Not married, nothing.	Mana casarasqa, mana imapas.
But he knew it.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi.
Being good now.	Kunanqa allin kay.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I don’t like it either.	Ñuqapas manam gustanchu.
If you do that.	Sichus chayta ruwanki chayqa.
That would be better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I am not so sure.	Manam chayna segurochu kani.
I knew this would happen.	Yacharqanim kay pasananta.
We are anyone.	Pipas kanchik.
It is no longer good here.	Kaypiqa manañam allinchu.
But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
It looks very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
How does it work.	Imaynatataq.
Yes, it is.	Arí, nispa.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
Today was a good day.	Kunan punchawqa allinmi karqa.
But it wasn’t going to work out.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanan karqan.
I think you’ll be fine.	Allinmi kanki nispaymi piensani.
But that wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
The worst thing you can do.	Aswan mana allin ruway.
Maybe that would be better.	Ichapas chayqa aswan allin kanman.
But this is a really big thing.	Ichaqa kayqa chiqap hatun ima.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I know that you will.	Yachanim chayta ruwanaykipaq.
I knew he knew everything about me.	Yacharqanim ñuqamanta tukuy imata yachasqanmanta.
You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
Be a better person.	Aswan allin runa kay.
I really wanted to.	Chiqaptam munarqani.
Yes! 	Arí!
I know that's a good thing, though.	Yachanim chayqa allin kasqanmanta, ichaqa.
Okay, it’s bigger.	Allinmi, aswan hatun.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I’m happy here.	Kaypi kusisqa kachkani.
I think it’s true.	Chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
He doesn't know why.	Payqa manam yachanchu imanasqa chaytaqa.
That’s the process.	Chay ruway.
It means to do.	Ruway niyta munan.
I’m so, so worried.	Ñuqaqa chayna, ancha llakisqa kani.
Not really good.	Mana chiqap allinchu.
I didn’t want to do this.	Manam kayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
I know he is.	Yachanim payqa kasqanmanta.
More than anything else?	¿Astawan imamanta?
Like last night.	Qayna tuta hina.
But not always.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu.
But it may not mean much.	Ichaqa manapaschá anchatachu niyta munan.
The lonely man.	Sapallan runa.
Now I wonder what will happen.	Kunanqa imachus kanqa nispa tapukuni.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
I didn’t do that right.	Chaytaqa manam allintachu ruwarqani.
She couldn't believe it would happen again.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu hukmanta chay pasananta.
But it’s like doing something.	Ichaqa imatapas ruway hinan.
The second step is to	Iskay kaq ruway.
A lot of it’s not good.	Achka mana allinchu.
I know you are excited about it.	Yachanim chaymanta kusisqa kasqaykita.
What he’s done.	Ima ruwasqanmanta.
You can’t beat that.	Chaytaqa manam atipayta atiwaqchu.
He’s never like this.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hinachu.
No one knows for sure.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan.
He decided to find out what was going on.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi imachus kasqanmanta yachayta.
I really want to know.	Anchatam munani yachayta.
I don’t want to be someone else.	Manam huk runa kayta munanichu.
This is not the best way.	Kayqa manam aswan allinchu.
That’s not a bad thing.	Chayqa manam mana allinchu.
I wasn’t sure if it was right.	Manam segurochu karqani allinchu icha manachu.
This doesn't mean anything.	Kayqa manam imatapas niyta munanchu.
That was a little difficult.	Chayqa huk chhikantan sasa karqan.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmanta.
That’s the most interesting thing.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi.
I didn’t really want to.	Manam anchatachu munarqani.
That would have been a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman karqa.
You are an individual.	Sapa runam kanki.
I was very excited.	Ancha kusisqam karqani.
But now you know.	Kunanmi ichaqa yachanki.
Why are you guys.	Imanasqataq kanki.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
I was very sure of it.	Ancha segurom karqani chaymanta.
The lonely man.	Sapallan runa.
He was very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa kasqa.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
He barely could.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana atirqanchu.
I couldn’t tell.	Manam willayta atirqanichu.
It was a beautiful sight.	Sumaqmi karqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He was very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa kasqa.
It wasn't going to last long.	Manam unaytachu kanan karqa.
That’s still the case.	Chayqa hinallam kachkan.
This isn’t your case.	Kayqa manan qanpa hinachu.
Things are fine now.	Kunanqa imapas allinmi kachkan.
It’s a very good thing that it is.	Ancha allinmi chayna kananpaq.
You’re not sure.	Mana segurochu kanki.
I can’t do it.	Manam ruwayta atiymanchu.
I thought of a new coin.	Musuq qullqita yuyaykurqani.
You are so beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanki.
I don't know what's in it.	Manam yachanichu chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta.
It was obvious they were worried.	Sut’inmi karqan llakisqa kasqankuta.
He was like that.	Payqa hinam karqa.
I'll be good to you.	Allintam qampaq kasaq.
He knows he can do it.	Payqa yachanmi chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
It’s not safe.	Manam segurochu kachkan.
Not quite sure.	Mana allintachu seguro.
Now it's every day.	Kunanqa sapa punchawmi.
He was obviously nervous.	Payqa sut’inmi mancharisqa kasharqan.
But it’s not quite right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu.
Can you help ?.	¿Atiwaqchu yanapayta ?.
I have never seen this before.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa rikurqanichu.
Now, however, he is no longer there.	Kunanmi ichaqa manaña kanchu.
I know why it is.	Yachanim imanasqa kasqanmanta.
Clearly he is.	Sut’inmi payqa kashan.
Nothing was the same as before.	Manan imapas ñawpaq hinachu karqan.
I didn't really think this through.	Kaytaqa manam allintachu piensarqani.
I know you are a good person.	Yachanim allin runa kasqaykita.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
It was better, better.	Aswan allinmi karqan, aswan allinmi karqan.
He wasn’t a good guy.	Payqa manam allinchu karqa.
I'll do it right.	Allintam ruwasaq.
He seemed worried.	Payqa llakisqa hinam karqa.
He was such a nice guy.	Payqa chayna sumaq runam karqa.
He didn't look very good.	Payqa manam ancha allinchu rikchakurqa.
Who’s in the box? 	¿Pitaq chaypi kachkan?
It’s okay with me.	Allinmi ñuqawan.
He didn’t know what they were.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imakuna kasqankuta.
It’s been a long time.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
But it isn’t.	Ichaqa manan.
Not.	Mana.
I knew that was the case.	Chaytaqa yacharqanim.
A lonely week.	Huk sapallan semana.
What he meant by that.	Ima niyta munarqa.
But he wanted to talk about it.	Ichaqa chaymanta rimayta munarqa.
This was a great experience.	Kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But he is a great man.	Ichaqa hatun runam.
I'm pretty uncomfortable here.	Kaypiqa allintam mana allinchu kachkani.
I know they are there.	Yachanim chaypi kasqankuta.
But, that’s what he needs.	Ichaqa, chaytan necesitan.
Indeed, it was.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
He did the right thing.	Payqa allintan ruwarqan.
Maybe it’s a good thing it’s not so bad.	Ichapas allin kanman mana chayna mana allinchu.
But there is no future, not really.	Ichaqa manan hamuq tiempo kanchu, manan cheqaqtachu.
That would continue to be the case.	Chayqa hinallam kanman.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
It doesn’t matter. 	Manam imananpaschu. 
She’s really nice.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi.
Two years, maybe three.	Iskay wata, ichapas kimsa.
He always failed.	Payqa sapa kutim mana allintachu ruwarqa.
Pretending to be an everyday thing would not be easy.	Sapa punchaw imapas hina ruwayqa manam facilchu kanman.
There was no way he could do that.	Manan imapipas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
He really wants to talk.	Payqa chiqaptam rimayta munan.
But it was a great experience.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi karqan.
Both are where they are.	Iskayninkum maypi kasqankuta.
This is certainly a feature.	Kayqa cheqaqtapunin huk ruway.
I was the one.	Ñuqaqa karqani.
Maybe you’re the one.	Ichapas qamqa kanki.
All day long.	Tukuy punchaw.
But he is happy.	Ichaqa kusisqam kachkan.
Tell me what happened, he said.	Willay imakuna pasasqanmanta, nispa.
I knew it was going to happen.	Yacharqanim chayna kananta.
I don't know if this can work.	Mana yachanichu kay llamk'ayta atinmanchu icha manachu chayta.
I mean, it does .	Niyta munani, chayta ruwan .

She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
Everything was great.	Tukuy imapas ancha allinmi karqa.
Actually I was.	Chiqaptaqa karqani.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
No one knows what tomorrow will bring, ever.	Manam pipas yachanchu paqarin imakuna kananta, haykapipas.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.

I still can't believe it.	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu.
I want to know what’s going on here.	Kaypi imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta munani.
I knew that was the case.	Yacharqanim chayna kasqanmanta.
Sad but true.	Llakisqa ichaqa chiqap.
I really meant it too.	Ñuqapas chiqaptam chaytaqa niyta munarqani.
He certainly didn’t seem worried.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana llakisqa hinachu karqan.
That said, it’s not all bad.	Chayta nispa, mana tukuy mana allinchu.
He had to do it alone.	Chaytaqa sapallanmi ruwanan karqan.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Make the time to do it.	Tiempota ruway.
But he knew it was.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chayna kasqanmanta.
It should be clear.	Sut’inmi kanan.
He said it was okay.	Payqa allinmi nisqa.
Which would have been wrong.	Imataq mana allin kanman karqa.
But maybe that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
But maybe that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
But it will be good.	Ichaqa allinmi kanqa.
Not always though.	Mana sapa kutichu ichaqa.
I’m a little worried.	Huk chikan llakisqa kachkani.
But it’s still there.	Ichaqa hinallam kachkan.
I really like this one.	Kayqa anchatam gustan.

This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.

He looks very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa rikch’akun.
Everyone is happy.	Lliwmi kusisqa kachkanku.
It was really good.	Chiqaptam allin karqa.
He’s not a good guy.	Payqa manam allinchu.
You know this is true.	Kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam yachanki.
Be sure of that.	Chaytaqa seguro kay.
The event went very well.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allintam rirqa.

They are terrified of everything.	Paykunaqa tukuy imamanta mancharisqa kachkanku.

Everything else does.	Tukuy imapas ruwan.

He must continue to do so.	Hinallam ruwanan.
He knows everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yachan.

Are you sure about this?.	¿Segurochu kanki kaymanta?.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa.
It won’t be easy.	Manam facilchu kanqa.

Then the third.	Chaymanta kimsa kaq.
Where have you been?	¿Maypitaq karqanki?
You are a good person.	Qamqa huk allin runam kanki.
This process is very important.	Kay ruwayqa ancha allinmi.

No one seemed sure.	Manam pipas seguro hinachu karqa.

They seem pretty safe.	Paykunaqa allin seguro hinam kanku.
That's, well, never.	Chayqa, allinmi, mana hayk'aqpas.
He’s doing well.	Payqa allinmi kachkan.
It looks beautiful.	Sumaq rikchakun.
I knew it wasn't.	Yacharqanim mana chayna kasqanmanta.
That was going to fail.	Chayqa mana allintachu ruwanan karqan.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
Now do it.	Kunanqa ruway.
No one really knows.	Manam pipas chiqaptaqa yachanchu.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
It shouldn’t be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan.
No, certainly not.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin mana.
But he didn't think he would.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chayta ruwananta.
Last year’s performance.	Qayna wata ruway.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
But you never know.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu.
Nothing will ever be right.	Manan hayk’aqpas imapas allinchu kanqa.
That’s a nice thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi.
But I don’t think he will.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykunichu chayta ruwananta.
If you don’t want to buy it.	Mana rantiyta munaspaqa.
I’ve never seen it before.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
He doesn’t though.	Payqa manan ichaqa.
She refused to talk to him.	Payqa manan munarqanchu paywan rimayta.
He certainly couldn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana atirqanchu.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
There with you.	Chaypi qanwan kuska.
Please more, more.	Ama hina kaspa aswan, aswan.
He had to be.	Payqa kanan karqan.
It wouldn’t have been easy.	Manan facilchu kanman karqan.
He wasn’t sure.	Payqa manan segurochu kasqa.
I know that’s the case.	Chaytaqa yachanim.
I wanted to do something to stop it.	Mana chayta ruwananpaqmi imatapas ruwayta munarqani.
Here are some of them.	Kaypi wakin.
Many things.	Achka imakuna.
They are a lot of good.	Paykunaqa achka allinmi kanku.
It’s a very bad thing.	Ancha mana allinmi.

I can’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atinichu.
I knew you wanted time with him.	Yacharqanim paywan tiempota munasqaykita.
I know where he lives.	Yachanim maypi yachasqanmanta.
There was nothing you could do at that time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu karqan.
I can’t say anything.	Manam ima niyta atiymanchu.
I don’t want to know anything.	Manam imatapas yachayta munanichu.
It doesn’t seem to be good enough.	Mana allinchu kanman hina.
I know this is a good thing.	Yachanim kayqa allin kasqanmanta.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
But he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I didn't think it was any better.	Manam piensarqanichu aswan allin kananpaq.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan.
However, this approach is not recommended.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa manan allinchu.
He is a new character.	Payqa huk musuq runam.
I know there are many.	Yachanim achka kasqanmanta.
No, it’s not a good thing.	Manan, manan allinchu.
It shouldn’t be that way.	Manan chay hinachu kanan.

But this is not the case.	Ichaqa manan kayqa.
You have to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanayki.
He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
That must be difficult.	Chayqa sasa kanan tiyan.
It wasn’t a bit good.	Manam huk chikan allinchu karqa.
I know that's something.	Chayqa imapas kasqanmantam yachani.
It needs to do better.	Aswan allintam ruwanan.
I can't buy this.	Kaytaqa manam rantiyta atiymanchu.
Maybe, never.	Ichapas, mana haykapipas.
I said to myself.	nispaymi nirqani.
No one knows how many there are.	Manam pipas yachanchu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manam atiymanchu.
But no one wanted to go.	Ichaqa manan pipas riyta munarqanchu.
They are still there.	Paykunaqa hinallam kachkanku.
Yes, it is.	Arí, nispa.
I don’t think so.	Manam yuyanichu.
All the time,' he said.	Tukuy tiempon’, nispa.
He was very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa kasharqan.
Once, twice, many times.	Huk kuti, iskay kuti, achka kuti.
Today is a great day.	Kunan punchawqa hatun punchawmi.
He is a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam.
Maybe more than that.	Ichapas aswan achka.
One by one, one by one.	Hukmanta hukmanta.
I don't care what it looks like.	Manam imananpaschu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
Maybe there is nothing.	Ichapas mana imapas kanchu.
That was a great man.	Chayqa hatun runam karqa.
No, she was the nicest.	Manan, payqa aswan sumaqmi karqan.
He is always like that.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna.
I didn’t see that coming.	Manam rikurqanichu chay hamunanta.
No, it’s not.	Manan, manan.
This man offered me a job.	Kay runam llamkayta niwarqa.
What is this likely to be.	¿Imaynataq kayqa kanman.
That is not a good thing to do.	Chayna ruwayqa manam allinchu.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
That was supposed to be.	Chayqa kanan karqan.
That was not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanan karqan.
I know it's hard.	Yachanim sasa kasqanmanta.
He was the one.	Payqa karqan.
No one can do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
I’ve never seen it before.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
It seemed that good.	Chayna allinmi rikchakurqa.
The good thing here.	Allin kaq kaypi.
There were three.	Kimsa kasqa.
Maybe it would have been both.	Ichapas iskayninku kanman karqa.
But it’s better.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi.
This is actually not correct.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa manam allinchu.
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
It was today.	Kunanmi karqa.
I’m there again.	Hukmanta chaypi kachkani.
Better not, better not.	Aswan allinmi mana, aswan allinmi mana.
I don’t want to say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta munanichu.
It was such a beautiful place.	Chhayna sumaqmi karqan.
Yes, he certainly did.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
But it doesn’t seem right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu rikch’akun.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
You don’t know what it’s like.	Manam yachankichu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
It’s okay with me.	Allinmi ñuqawan.
You can’t do that anymore.	Chaytaqa manañan ruwayta atiwaqchu.
This is a new year.	Kayqa musuq wata.
He certainly said that.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta nirqan.
He’s doing well.	Payqa allinmi kachkan.
There will be many days.	Achka punchawmi kanqa.
Actually no, it still is.	Chiqaptaqa manam, hinallam kachkan.
It’s obviously the case.	Sut’inmi chay hina kasqanmanta.
As always, it was a bad one.	Sapa kuti hinam mana allin kaq karqa.
He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manan atirqanchu.
I would like to.	Munaymanmi.
I couldn’t believe that.	Chaytaqa manan creeyta atirqanichu.
That means everything.	Chayqa tukuy imatam niyta munan.
More than anything else.	Imamantapas aswan achka.
I’m always right.	Ñuqaqa sapa kutim.
Something wasn’t right.	Imapas manam allinchu karqa.
I didn’t want to be one.	Manam huk kayta munarqanichu.
But today is the day.	Ichaqa kunan punchawmi chay punchaw.
I don’t know why that would happen.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kananta.
I still can't believe it.	Hinallam mana creeyta atinichu.
You’re a human being.	Qamqa runam kanki.
He was busy.	Payqa ocupasqa kasqa.
There was nothing wrong with it.	Manam imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I know too much.	Llumpay achkatam yachani.
He seems very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa hinam kachkan.
I thought you wanted to know.	Yuyarqanim yachayta munasqaykita.
You need to do better.	Aswan allintam ruwanayki.
Now he knew that wouldn't happen.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi chay mana pasananta.
That’s something.	Chayqa imapas.
I didn’t know he was married.	Manam yacharqanichu casarasqa kasqanmanta.
But he cannot speak properly.	Ichaqa manan allintachu rimayta atinman.
There is nothing here for you.	Kaypiqa manam imapas qampaq kanchu.

I wasn’t anyone very happy.	Manam pipas ancha kusisqachu karqani.
I knew it was there.	Yacharqanim chaypi kasqanmanta.
He says something.	Payqa imatapas nin.
For not doing it.	Mana ruwasqanmanta.
No one knows for sure.	Manan pipas cheqaqtachu yachan.
You want it very well.	Ancha allintam munanki.
Are you okay with it?	¿Allinchu kachkanki?
That was always something.	Chayqa sapa kutim imapas karqa.
I know this won’t happen.	Yachanim kay mana pasananta.
Yeah, it’s not that good.	Arí, manam chayna allinchu.
I can’t tell anyone.	Manam pimanpas willayta atiymanchu.
You are now.	Kunanmi kanki.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
What? 	Ima?
He knew what he was doing.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwasqanmanta.
The truth of the matter.	Chiqap kaq.
I want to do something, be someone.	Imatapas ruwayta munani, pipas kayta.
That may not be a good idea.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu kanqa.
Very good though.	Ancha allin ichaqa.
I hope to do it again for sure.	Suyachkani hukmanta ruwayta seguro.
It could be worse, you know.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman, yachanki.
But it is a good thing to do.	Ichaqa allinmi chay ruwayqa.
I didn’t want to share anything about myself.	Manam imatapas ñuqamanta willayta munarqanichu.
More, more, and more.	Aswan, aswan, nispa.
That looks pretty interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
I was very curious.	Ñuqaqa anchatam yachayta munarqani.
I think he was at home.	Yuyaykuni wasinpi kasqanmanta.
But no one knew what to do.	Ichaqa manan pipas yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.
But it isn’t.	Ichaqa manan.
I know he can.	Yachanim atisqanmanta.
No one can be sure.	Manan pipas seguro kayta atinmanchu.
I knew it was going to happen.	Yacharqanim chayna kananta.
But it will take some time.	Ichaqa huk tiempon kanqa.
I am sure it will be good.	Seguro kani allin kananmanta.
I’m sure he will.	Seguro kani chayta ruwananmanta.
I just couldn’t get over it.	Chaylla mana atipayta atirqanichu.
To do that, he said.	Chayta ruwananpaq.
You didn’t know where you were.	Manam yacharqankichu maypi kasqaykita.
Who doesn’t?.	¿Pitaq mana?.
I know it's not much.	Yachanim mana ancha kasqanmanta.
It couldn’t be easier.	Mana aswan facilchu kanman.
It may not be a good thing.	Manapaschá allinchu.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
I meant to say.	Niyta munarqani.
I want to know it’s going to be okay.	Allinmi kananta yachayta munani.
Nothing was the same as before.	Manan imapas ñawpaq hinachu karqan.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.
I didn’t want to.	Manam munarqanichu.
I didn’t see it coming.	Manam hamunanta rikurqanichu.
But it’s probably.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan hinachu karqan.
That’s nice here.	Chayqa sumaqmi kaypi.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
That’s the way it is.	Chayna kay.
This doesn't seem right.	Kayqa manam allinchu rikchakun.
Could he have been able to.	¿Atinmanchu karqan.
I have a way to do this.	Kayta ruwanaypaqqa imaynatachus ruwanay tiyan.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmanta.
That’s going to continue.	Chayqa hinallam kanqa.
Nothing was right.	Manam imapas allinchu karqa.
He knew he didn't want to.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana munasqanmanta.
What.	Ima.
That doesn’t make it any better.	Chayqa manan aswan allintachu ruwan.
No one could do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
He refused to talk.	Payqa manan rimayta munarqanchu.
I will continue to do so.	Hinallam chayta ruwasaq.
But they are not as good as humans.	Ichaqa manan runa hinachu allin kanku.
The second step is to	Iskay kaq ruway.
Something’s not quite right there.	Imapas mana allintachu chaypi.
I'd rather have something else.	Aswan allinmi kanman huk imatapas.
That’s what it’s going to be.	Chayqa kanqa.
But now you know it’s not that easy.	Ichaqa kunanmi yachanki mana chayna facilchu kasqanmanta.
You know exactly why.	Allintam yachanki imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
Pretty busy though.	Allin ocupasqa ichaqa.
He couldn’t tell.	Payqa manan yachayta atirqanchu.
He knows what he did wrong.	Payqa yachanmi mana allin ruwasqanmanta.
But then, that would be good.	Ichaqa chaymanta, chayqa allin kanman.
He can't say anything yet.	Manaraqmi imatapas niyta atinchu.
Everything else	Sapa imapas
I know that for sure.	Chaytaqa allintam yachani.
This is no longer available.	Kayqa manañam kanchu.
Now, if only.	Kunanqa, sichus chaylla.
This should be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi kanan.
I’m glad about it.	Kusikuni chaymanta.
Maybe someone knows more.	Ichapas pipas astawan yachan.
You know you’re beautiful.	Yachanki sumaq kasqaykita.
I’ve never seen it before.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
He doesn’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munanchu.
However, that will no longer work.	Ichaqa, chayqa manañan allinchu kanqa.
Maybe a year.	Ichapas huk wata.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Quick about that, right?	Utqaylla chaymanta, ¿riki?
I don't know what to do now.	Kunanqa manam yachanichu imata ruwanayta.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
Well.	Allin.
But this wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allinchu kanman.
What was wrong with it.	Imataq mana allin karqa.
The human being.	Runa kaq.
I know what he wants.	Yachanim ima munasqanmanta.
It’s not, however.	Manam ichaqa.
No one cares about that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas imananpaschu.
Yes, it’s a good one.	Arí, allinmi.
There isn’t much time.	Manam ancha tiempo kanchu.
I'm still waiting, actually.	Hinallam suyachkani, chiqaptaqa.
I’m glad he wasn’t there.	Kusikuni mana chaypi kasqanmanta.
I didn't think of that.	Chaytaqa manam piensarqanichu.
Here’s the thing.	Kaypiqa.
Less than nothing.	Mana imamanta aswan pisi.
I mean it’s human.	Runa kasqanmantam niyta munani.
Not nearly as much as it should be.	Mana yaqa chay hinachu kanan hina.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan chayqa.
This is no longer so certain today.	Kayqa manañam kunan tiempopiqa chayna segurochu.
I wanted it so badly.	Sinchitan munarqani.
It’s not a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu.
He said it wouldn't work.	Payqa nirqam mana allinchu kananmanta.
I did, but not quite.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani, ichaqa manan allintachu.
It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
You have to keep doing it.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwanayki.
The worst part of it.	Aswan mana allin kaq.
He’s very good at it though.	Payqa ancha allinmi chaypi ichaqa.
Worse than that, even more.	Aswan mana allin chaymanta, astawan.
Alright.	Allinmi.
Maybe it would be good.	Ichapas allin kanman.
He's happy, man.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan, runa.
. . . .	.
However, this was not a very successful process.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa ancha allinchu karqan.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
Actually, maybe both.	Chiqaptaqa, ichapas iskayninku.
He is very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
Maybe the third.	Ichapas kimsa kaq.
One day the other day seemed so much.	Huk punchawmi huk punchawqa anchata rikchakurqa.
That’s really nice.	Chayqa chiqap sumaqmi.
Nobody wants this.	Kaytaqa manam pipas munanchu.
But no, that wasn’t right.	Ichaqa manan, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
I think that’s saying something.	Chayqa imatapas niyta munan, nispa yuyani.
I knew he would.	Yacharqanim chayna ruwananta.
You never know.	Qamqa manam haykapipas yachankichu.
I still wonder if it really is.	Hinallam tapukuni sichus chiqaptapuni chayna kasqanmanta.
He knew he couldn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana atisqanmanta.
That wasn’t easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan.
Today is a beautiful day, isn't it?	Kunan punchawqa sumaq punchawmi, ¿aw?
He is a.	Payqa huk.
He realized what he had done.	Payqa repararqanmi ima ruwasqanmanta.
I know you want to help.	Yachanim yanapayta munasqaykita.
It was such a day.	Chay punchawqa chayna punchawmi karqa.
I hope it doesn’t.	Suyachkani mana chayna kananpaq.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He thought it was.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chay hina kananpaq.
That morning.	Chay paqarin.
That’s what it looked like.	Chayqa rikchakurqa.
That was a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi karqa.
He's really enjoying it.	Payqa chiqaptam chaypi kusisqa kachkan.
I know it probably wasn't right.	Yachanim manapaschá allinchu karqa.
The first year of the	Ñawpaq kaq wata.
But of course that wasn’t the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu karqan.
Nothing about humanity.	Mana imapas runa kaymanta.
He wasn't alone, he said.	Payqa manam sapallanchu karqa, nispa.
He wanted to do this alone.	Payqa sapallanmi kayta ruwayta munarqan.
I am a morning person.	Paqarin runam kani.
It should be about now.	Yaqa kunanmi kanan.
He can't help it.	Mana yanapayta atinchu.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
But yeah, maybe.	Ichaqa arí, ichapas.
But you weren’t here all that time.	Ichaqa manan chay tukuy tiempopiqa kaypichu karqanki.

There is no such thing at this time.	Kay tiempopiqa manan kanchu.
But could it have been so easy.	Ichaqa, ¿chayna facilchu kanman karqa.
But this isn’t it.	Ichaqa kayqa manan.

For example? 	Kay hina?
He recognized the opportunity.	Payqa repararqanmi chay oportunidadta.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.

But it’s not like it used to be.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu.
However, this approach is not very effective.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa mana ancha allinchu.
Everything went well, everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa, tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
I was happy that he was so happy about it.	Kusisqam karqani chaymanta ancha kusisqa kasqanmanta.

It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.

You have to do this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwanayki.

That was not an easy task.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu karqan.

I just didn’t want to talk to him anymore.	Chaylla manaña paywan rimayta munarqanichu.

You are too good a person not to do it.	Qamqa ancha allin runam kanki mana ruwanaykipaq.
He certainly did.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.
He knew he didn't have to.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayta ruwanan kasqanmanta.
That wouldn’t work at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas allinchu kanman.

In fact, it really can be that bad.	Chiqaptaqa, chiqaptam chayna mana allin kanman.

If you’re not happy, do something about it.	Mana kusisqachu kanki chayqa, imatapas ruway.
But that’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu.
He didn’t think about anything.	Payqa manan imapipas yuyaykurqanchu.
He was always busy.	Payqa sapa kutim ocupasqa karqa.
I’m tired of it.	Sayk’usqa kani.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
Now he could do nothing.	Kunanqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
In fact, he always was.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa sapa kutim karqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He has nothing.	Payqa manan imapas kanchu.
It’s a very bad thing.	Ancha mana allinmi.
Maybe that would be a good thing.	Ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
He was like that.	Payqa hinam karqa.
Having a cup of coffee with you would be nice.	Qamwan kuska huk kukata ruwayqa allinmi kanman.
He knew what they were like.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna kasqankuta.
This means now.	Kayqa kunan niyta munan.

Something could be wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman.
Okay, more often than not.	Allinmi, aswan sapa kuti.

One day the other day seemed so much.	Huk punchawmi huk punchawqa anchata rikchakurqa.

It’s not, it’s not.	Manam mana.
But he didn’t want to know for sure.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachayta munarqan.
I don’t want that person to be involved in anything.	Manam munanichu chay runa imapipas chaypi kananta.
No, he doesn’t.	Manan, payqa manan.

He refused to say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas rimayta munarqanchu.
I didn’t want to win.	Manam atipayta munarqanichu.
He told me.	Niwarqa.
He knew something was wrong.	Payqa yacharqanmi imapas mana allin kashasqanmanta.
He didn’t know what a big deal it was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima hatun ruway kasqanmanta.
The first day was good.	Ñawpaq p’unchawqa allinmi karqan.
Many times.	Achka kuti.
That’s what I was.	Chayqa karqani.

But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
All this quick stuff.	Tukuy kay utqaylla imakuna.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmanta.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
He wanted to know where it could be.	Payqa yachayta munarqa maypi kanman chayta.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
I didn’t always do that.	Manam sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwaq kani.
I know that he will.	Yachanim chayna ruwananta.
I don't know why that is.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
Last night.	Qayna tuta.
I think about what will happen.	Yuyaykuni imakuna pasananta.
It was about .	Chayqa karqan yaqa .
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.

Is that right?.	¿Allinchu chay?.
No, it wasn’t.	Manan, manan chay hinachu karqan.
He wants to know everything about everything.	Tukuy imamanta tukuy imamanta yachayta munan.
He was really worried.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin llakisqa kasharqan.
It seems to do that.	Chayta ruwanman hina.
Yes, that’s what he meant.	Arí, chaytan niyta munarqan.
That there was nothing wrong with it.	Mana imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
I wanted to know more.	Astawan yachayta munarqani.

He is always worried.	Payqa sapa kutim llakisqa kachkan.
He said he didn't.	Payqa nirqam mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He was too lonely.	Payqa llumpay sapallanmi karqa.

I don’t mean to say.	Manam niyta munanichu.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
I don’t want to know.	Manam yachayta munanichu.
There is no certainty here.	Kaypiqa manam segurochu.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
All right, all right.	Allinmi, allinmi.
So good, very good.	Chayna allin, ancha allin.
That, perhaps, was a good thing.	Chayqa, ichapas, allin karqa.
But I really wanted him to.	Ichaqa anchatan munarqani chayta ruwananta.
I don’t really know.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani.
Maybe it would be very useful.	Ichapas ancha allin kanman.
He was alone now.	Payqa kunanqa sapallanmi kasqa.
Many, many times.	Achka, achka kuti.
That’s right, one by one.	Chayqa allinmi, hukmanta hukmanta.
He wasn’t alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu karqa.
He was a human being.	Payqa runan karqan.
There may not be enough beauty here.	Kaypiqa manapaschá allintachu sumaq kayqa kanman.
But he didn’t want that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa munarqanchu.
He was more worried about it.	Aswan llakisqa kasqa chaymanta.
He didn’t know what was going to happen.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus kananta.
Not like it is now.	Mana kunan hinachu.
Great performance.	Hatun ruway.
He wanted to know where she was.	Payqa maypi kasqanmanta yachayta munarqa.
It’s not very good.	Ancha mana allinchu.
He continued to do so.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwarqa.
I think he did that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwasqanmanta.
But he was very much like that.	Ichaqa payqa anchatan chay hina karqan.
I knew he was a real person	Yacharqanim chiqap runa kasqanmanta

He will do well.	Payqa allintam ruwanqa.

But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.
Make a lot of money.	Ruway achka qullqita.
I couldn’t be happier.	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atirqanichu.
But, that doesn’t mean anything.	Ichaqa, chayqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu.
Something's wrong there.	Chaypi imapas mana allin.

It wouldn’t be a good thing.	Mana allinchu kanman.
I wasn’t sure what he was doing now	Manam segurochu karqani kunan ima ruwasqanmanta

What’s the possibility.	¿Imataq kanman.
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
You know that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi yachanki.

But that may not really be the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá cheqaqtachu chhayna kanman.
It certainly would be.	Cheqaqtapunin chayna kanman.
Can you do it for yourself.	¿Atiwaqchu qampaq.
A real person.	Chiqap runa.

If you don't have it, you want it really bad.	Mana kanchu chayqa, chiqap mana allintam munanki.
Now he wasn't so sure.	Kunanqa manañam chayna segurochu karqa.
I’m not really worried about that	Manam chaymantaqa anchatachu llakikuni

You were happy.	Kusisqam karqanki.
I can’t say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu.
You can’t be sure.	Manan seguro kayta atiwaqchu.

I knew it was going to happen	Yacharqanim chayna kananta
I knew it was wrong.	Yacharqanim mana allin kasqanmanta.
It is indeed very good.	Cheqaqtapunin ancha allin.
Not much good about it.	Mana ancha allinchu chaymanta.

Nothing is right anymore.	Manañam imapas allinchu.

I didn't think things would be that bad	Manam piensarqanichu imapas chayna mana allin kananta
Maybe he really doesn’t like me	Ichapas payqa chiqaptapuni mana gustawanchu
What would it have been.	Imataq kanman karqa.
Everything else.	Tukuy wakin imakuna.
Everything should be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanan.
He’s not very good.	Payqa manan ancha allinchu.
I know how hard it is for you	Yachanim imayna sasa qampaq kasqanmanta
He knew what he wanted.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima munasqanmanta.

This is not easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu.
I don’t know what to do, really.	Manam yachanichu ima ruwanayta, chiqaptaqa.
I don’t know how he did it.	Manam yachanichu imayna ruwasqanmanta.
What will be the result?.	¿Imataq kanqa?.
In fact, it could have been worse.	Chiqaptaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqa.
But no one knows for sure.	Ichaqa manan pipas allintachu yachan.

I couldn't believe the time would go by so fast	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayna utqaylla tiempo pasananta

Hopefully this never happens	Munaymanmi kay mana haykapipas pasananta

Now, do that.	Kunanqa, chayta ruway.

I wasn't sure how many	Manam segurochu karqani hayka kasqanmantaqa
If anything, it was worse.	Sichus imapas karqan chayqa, aswan mana allinmi karqan.
I know what it is	Yachanim ima kasqanmantaqa
No, not very often.	Manan, manan ancha sapa kutichu.
I am not sure that this is a practice.	Manam allintachu yachani kay ruway kasqanmantaqa.
It’s faster.	Aswan utqaylla.
Of course, there is none today.	Arí, kunan tiempopiqa manan kanchu.
I saw nothing, nothing yet	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu, manaraqmi imatapas
It was wonderful for me too.	Ñuqapas ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I was pretty sure of that	Chaymantaqa allintam seguro karqani
What will he do.	Imatataq ruwanqa.
That’s what you mean.	Chaytaqa niyta munanki.
It could be a week, it could be two weeks.	Huk semanan kanman, iskay semanan kanman.
He's been there a long time, he said	Unayñan chaypi kashan, nispa
I wanted him to be with me all the time	Tukuy tiempon paywan kananta munarqani
But the next day is harder.	Ichaqa paqarin punchawmi aswan sasa.
I don’t want to be sad	Manam munanichu llakisqa kayta
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
Maybe that’s the right thing to do.	Ichapas chayna allin kanman.
There are three of us.	Kimsa kanchik.
This was not the case.	Kayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I knew it was going to be a big deal	Yacharqanim hatun ruway kananta
I thought that was no no.	Chayqa mana mana kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He was in a hurry.	Payqa usqhayllan kasharqan.
That would have been nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman karqa.
Today was the worst.	Kunan punchawmi aswan mana allin karqa.
Nothing else about it.	Mana imapas chaymantaqa.
Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi.
He had to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
I need to do that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwanay.
I was actually really worried	Chiqaptaqa chiqaptam llakisqa karqani
I couldn’t say it was good	Manam niyta atirqanichu allin kasqanmanta
You should have done that a long time ago.	Chaytaqa unayñan ruwanayki karqan.
The process continues to this day.	Chay ruwayqa kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.
I don't want to believe this	Kaytaqa manam creeyta munanichu
That’s really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan.
I didn’t know why he did that	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa chaynata ruwasqanmanta
But it’s not quite there.	Ichaqa manan allintachu chaypi kashan.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
That was the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
Someone else did it	Huk runam chayta ruwarqa
I am beautiful in every way	Tukuy imapipas sumaqmi kani
I couldn’t speak.	Manam rimayta atirqanichu.
This he obviously can’t do.	Kaytaqa payqa sut’inmi mana ruwayta atinchu.
I never knew you existed	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu kasqaykita
But you have to do it right now.	Ichaqa kunanmi allinta ruwanayki.
I wonder if it’s okay	Allinchu kasqanmanta tapukuni
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu.
I never know how to say this	Manam haykapipas kayta niyta yachanichu
I am more certain.	Ñuqaqa aswan segurom kani.
They are there now.	Paykunaqa kunanmi chaypi kachkanku.
I’m glad it’s wrong.	Kusikuni mana allin kasqanmanta.
Yes, such a person.	Arí, chayna runa.
He does, however, do well.	Payqa ichaqa allintam ruwan.
It’s a beautiful day.	Sumaq punchawmi.
But as always, things are never that simple.	Ichaqa sapa kuti hina, manan hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu imapas.
I could not have been happier	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atiymanchu karqa
I didn’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu.
I can’t do anything about that	Chaytaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
I am very, very happy.	Ancha, ancha kusisqam kachkani.
I don’t want to do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munanichu
Where are you?.	Maypitaq kachkanki?.
I didn’t really want to talk to him now	Kunanqa manan anchatachu paywan rimayta munarqani
At one time I was very good.	Huk tiempopiqa ancha allinmi karqani.
I had no intention of doing that	Chay ruwayqa manan yuyaykurqanichu
This is probably a good thing.	Kayqa ichapas allin kanman.
Maybe it would be good.	Ichapas allin kanman.
But that’s pretty much obvious.	Ichaqa chayqa yaqa sut’inmi.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Ichapas huk chikan, ichapas achka.
Something else.	Huk imapas.
Person.	Runa.
He said no, it’s fine.	Payqa manan, allinmi kashan nirqan.
He said that it was not.	Payqa mana chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I would never do that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
He knew this was coming.	Payqa yacharqanmi kay hamunanta.
I didn’t know what to do.	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
This was a great experience.	Kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
How could it be.	Imaynataq kanman.
It means frequently.	Sapa kuti niyta munan.
He was actually quite nice.	Payqa chiqaptaqa allin sumaq runam karqa.
You want to know everything.	Tukuy imata yachayta munanki.
I think tomorrow will be a good day	Paqarinmi allin punchaw kananmanta yuyani
She really wanted to share it with him but she was scared.	Payqa anchatan paywan willayta munarqan ichaqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
I know you are new here.	Yachanim kaypi musuq kasqaykita.
I couldn't believe what was happening	Manam creeyta atirqanichu imakuna pasasqanmanta
I don’t know anything about this really.	Manam imatapas kaymanta yachanichu chiqaptaqa.
A really nice guy.	Chiqap sumaq runa.
You know what.	Yachankichu imata.
He didn't know how to deal with this.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu kayta imayna atipananta.
I wonder what he’ll do about it	Tapukuni imatataq chaymanta ruwanqa nispa
That’s obviously not the case.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
I am still overwhelmed	Hinallam llumpay llakisqa kachkani
I want him to win that.	Chayta atipananta munani.
I never thought it would happen	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna kananta
This seems pretty bad.	Kayqa ancha mana allinmi rikchakun.
I wonder if I like it	Tapukunitaqmi gustawanchu icha manachu chayta
Really, I am very sorry	Chiqaptam, anchata llakikuni
I was excited about something	Imamantapas kusisqam karqani
He told me he didn’t know.	Mana yachanchu niwarqa.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kayqa.
It was the morning.	Paqarinmi karqa.
He wasn’t alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu karqan.
That seems to be the case.	Chayqa kanman hinam.
I didn’t want to be this	Manam kayta munarqanichu
I am fine	Allinmi kachkani
I know this to be true	Kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam yachani
This can be a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinmi kanman.
He is very lonely.	Payqa ancha sapallanmi.
I had no idea how to do it	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imayna ruwanaypaq
I didn't know it was coming	Manam yacharqanichu hamunanta, nispa
That worked out pretty well	Chayqa allintam allinta ruwarqa
' '.	' '.
I really couldn’t tell	Chiqaptaqa manam yachayta atirqanichu
It seemed great at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
That’s what I wanted to know	Chaytan yachayta munarqani
Tomorrow I will be worse	Paqarinmi aswan mana allin kasaq
I didn’t know that.	Manam chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
Then, or afterwards.	Chaymanta, icha chaymanta.
I think he was happy.	Kusisqa kasqanmantam piensani.
Things weren’t quite right.	Imapas manam allintachu karqa.
I’ve always been busy, too busy.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi ocupasqa karqani, llumpay ocupasqa.
He was never too sure about it.	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa llumpayta segurochu karqa.
How beautiful it is.	Imayna sumaqmi.
Now it's like here.	Kunanqa kaypi hinam kachkan.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
I couldn’t speak.	Manam rimayta atirqanichu.
I couldn't figure out why.	Manam imarayku chayna kasqanmantaqa yachayta atirqanichu.
You don’t know what it’s going to be like.	Manan yachankichu imayna kananta.
I’m good at it.	Allinmi kani chaypi.
That, however, was not the case.	Chayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I used to be too	Ñuqapas haykapipas karqani
But you can’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I don’t want to.	Manam munanichu.
I think that's for sure	Chayqa seguro kasqanmantam piensani
But that was not the case here.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan kaypiqa.
He knew he never would.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana hayk’aqpas chayta ruwananta.
He kept going.	Payqa hinallam rirqa.
I'm a .	Ñuqaqa huk.
It’s going to be difficult.	Sasa kanqa.
It would be very useful.	Ancha allinmi kanman.
It didn’t go badly.	Manam mana allintachu rirqa.
Three, two, one.	Kimsa, iskay, huk.
But it’s not anymore.	Ichaqa manañan.
You can’t come here.	Manam kayman hamuyta atiwaqchu.
I'll do everything.	Tukuy imatam ruwasaq.
I couldn’t believe it	Manam creeyta atirqanichu
But not for very long.	Ichaqa manan ancha unaytachu.
Where is it located?.	Maypitaq kachkan?.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
She’s beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I was sure of that	Chaymantaqa segurom karqani
I know what he’s thinking	Yachanim ima yuyaykusqanmanta
We’re better than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan allinmi kayku.
I can’t say anymore though	Manañam ichaqa niyta atiymanchu
I couldn’t have said it	Manam niyta atiymanchu karqa
He said that it was not.	Payqa mana chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.
I knew something was very wrong	Yacharqanim imapas ancha mana allin kasqanmanta
Is it as good as this.	¿Kay hina allinchu.
I was the one.	Ñuqaqa karqani.
But he didn’t know.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu.
I know how hard it is	Yachanim chayna sasa kasqanmanta
I mean the first one was good	Niyta munani ñawpaq kaq allinmi karqa
Maybe it doesn’t matter now	Ichapas kunanqa mana imananpaschu
It’s not a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu.
That’s a good, very good thing.	Chayqa allinmi, ancha allinmi.
But he couldn’t say.	Ichaqa manan niyta atirqanchu.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I really think you should	Chiqaptam piensani chayta ruwanaykipaq
He looked very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam rikchakurqa.
But nothing much.	Ichaqa manan imapas anchatachu.
He was a human being.	Payqa runam karqa.
I didn’t want to talk anymore	Manañam rimayta munarqanichu
That would be a mistake.	Chayna ruwayqa manam allinchu kanman.
I sure wanted to.	Seguro munarqani.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
I know that for sure.	Chaytaqa allintam yachani.
I thought hard about it.	Sinchitan yuyaykurqani.
Another person.	Huk runa.
Here it is now.	Kaypi kunan kachkan.
He was a human being.	Payqa runam karqa.
I wanted to make sure he was right	Allin kasqanmantam seguro kayta munarqani
I spent some time with him.	Huk tiempon paywan karqani.
All right, yes.	Allinmi, arí.
I knew he was here	Yacharqanim kaypi kasqanmantaqa
But it is a very difficult time.	Ichaqa ancha sasa tiempon.
I didn't think it was there	Manam piensarqanichu chaypi kasqanmanta
I mean, tomorrow morning	Niyta munani, paqarin paqarin
I almost wish it were	Yaqapaschá chayna kananta munani
I suspect it doesn’t matter	Sospechani mana imananpaschu
I knew it would be there	Yacharqanim chaypi kananta
I know what they are	Yachanim ima kasqankuta
I still wanted to be with him.	Hinallam paywan kayta munarqani.
I’ve wanted it for a long time	Unayñan munarqani
What was it that happened.	Imataq karqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
This was not going to be good.	Kayqa mana allinchu kanan karqa.
I don't know why anyone would want this job.	Mana yachanichu imarayku pipas kay llamkayta munanman.
He wasn’t always there.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu karqan.
I often wonder if there is another way	Sapa kutim tapukuni huk ruway kanchu icha manachu chayta
I am very happy about that.	Chaymantaqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.
I just didn’t see what a big deal it was	Chaylla mana rikurqanichu ima hatun ruway kasqanmanta
I couldn’t figure that out	Manam chaytaqa yachayta atirqanichu
I never thought he would do so much	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna llumpayta ruwananta
That would certainly do that.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanman.
But there is no time.	Ichaqa manan tiempo kanchu.
I don't know if it really is.	Mana yachanichu sichus chiqaptapuni chayna kasqanmanta.
I can’t do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atinichu.
I always am, I always am, I always will be	Sapa kutim kani, sapa kutim kani, sapa kutim kasaq
I think he’s tired of knowing too much.	Yuyaykuni llumpayta yachasqanmanta sayk’usqa kasqanmanta.
This was not an easy task.	Kayqa manam facilchu karqa.
I was sure there was something there	Seguro karqani chaypi imapas kasqanmanta
Very many.	Ancha achka.
That’s not going to happen here.	Chayqa manan kaypichu kanqa.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
He was there all day.	Payqa tukuy punchawmi chaypi karqa.
I know how to play this well	Kayta pukllayta allinta yachani
I want to do it again	Hukmanta ruwayta munani
Then the big deal.	Chaymanta hatun ruway.
It’s the next day.	Paqarin punchawmi.
I really didn’t know why	Chiqaptaqa manam yacharqanichu imanasqa chaytaqa
I thought about it but I meant it	Chayta yuyaykurqani ichaqa niyta munarqani
Here’s to me.	Kaypi ñuqawan.
There is nothing about it.	Manam imapas chaymantaqa kanchu.
I didn’t really want to talk to him now.	Kunanqa manan anchatachu paywan rimayta munarqani.
The really bad thing.	Chiqap mana allin kaq.
He couldn’t do anything about it.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
He is now the man.	Payqa kunanmi chay runa.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
That was it.	Chayqa karqa.
I wonder what he’s thinking	Tapukuni ima yuyaykusqanmanta
I didn’t know what to do	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanaypaq
Everything was like that.	Tukuy imapas chayna kasqa.
What do you want to do about it?.	¿Imatataq chaymanta ruwayta munanki?.
That’s a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi.
Which would be great.	Imataq ancha allin kanman.
What is that.	Imataq chay.
I never knew there were so many.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna achka kasqanmanta.
You’re not sure.	Manam segurochu kanki.
I hope it was for you	Suyachkani qampaq kasqanmanta
I thought that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani
I never said it right	Manam haykapipas allintachu nirqani
Every day was a great day.	Sapa punchawmi hatun punchaw karqa.
It does a lot more.	Aswan achkatam ruwan.
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
He needs to do better.	Payqa aswan allintan ruwanan.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
First of all.	Ñawpaqtaqa.
He wasn’t like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
It should be a good one.	Allinmi kanan.
I thought it was pretty cool.	Ñuqaqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
You didn’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yacharqankichu.
But not everything is that simple.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imapas chhayna facilchu.
But I knew it was	Ichaqa yacharqanim chayna kasqanmanta
Better than nothing.	Aswan allinmi mana imamantapas.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
I know what that is like	Yachanim chay imayna kasqanmanta
I need to do better	Aswan allinta ruwanay tiyan
It’s either good or bad.	Allinmi icha mana allinchu.
Everything remained the same.	Tukuy imapas hinallam karqa.
He was a human being. 	Payqa runam karqa. 
I really thought you were mad at me	Cheqaqtapunin yuyaykurqani ñoqawan phiñasqa kasqaykita
He and she and him.	Paywan paywan.
But this is.	Ichaqa kay.
I suspect that is the case	Chayna kasqanmantam sospechani
That was not an easy task	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu karqan
I know that he will	Yachanim chayna ruwananta
He looked very nervous.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I knew you could do it wrong	Yacharqanim mana allinta ruwayta atisqaykita
But I couldn’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwayta atirqanichu.
I didn’t want to do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanichu
It was a difficult time.	Chayqa sasa tiempon karqan.
I thought it was true.	Ñuqaqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He knew it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi.
But I want it right.	Ichaqa allintam munani.
I haven’t seen it before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu
It was a good day.	Allin punchawmi karqa.
That doesn’t seem to be the case here.	Kaypiqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
I know what you are not	Yachanim ima mana kasqaykita
It’s not the worst.	Aswan mana allinchu.
Maybe he did just that.	Ichapas payqa chayta ruwarqa.
But he refused to do so	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu
The second step is important.	Iskay kaq ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
I’m really excited.	Chiqaptam kusisqa kachkani.
He was like that.	Payqa hinam karqa.
Time to be gone.	Tiempo manaña kananpaq.
That’s a nice thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi.
I don’t want to talk about it yet.	Manaraqmi chaymantaqa rimayta munanichu.
I didn’t see anyone or anything	Manam pitapas nitaq imatapas rikurqanichu
He was immediately terrified.	Chaylla mancharisqa.
He didn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa munarqanchu.
I want to have a word or two with you	Munani huk iskay simita qanwan rimayta
That won’t always be the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu kanqa.
But someone did it.	Ichaqa pipas chaytan ruwarqan.
I like it quite a bit	Allintam gustan
That’s everything.	Chayqa tukuy imapas.
I was a little nervous, that’s all	Huk chikan mancharisqa karqani, chaylla
I knew he was worried	Yacharqanim llakisqa kasqanmanta
This is not going to work.	Kayqa manan allintachu ruwanqa.
He knew it wouldn’t be easy.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana facilchu kananta.
No, he doesn’t.	Manan, payqa manan.
He couldn’t talk about anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas rimayta atirqanchu.
I didn’t know what it was	Manam yacharqanichu ima kasqanmanta
I couldn’t say no at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan mana niyta atirqanichu
Nothing new about it.	Manam imapas musuq chaymantaqa.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
A little harder than that.	Chaymanta huk chikan aswan sasa.
I know there could be something better than this	Yachanim kaymanta aswan allin imapas kanman
I knew what was coming next.	Yacharqanim chaymanta imakuna hamunanta.
I never know what he's going to do	Manam haykapipas yachanichu ima ruwananta
Do this first.	Ñawpaqtaqa kayta ruway.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan.
I was very curious	Anchatam yachayta munarqani
Some good, some not so good.	Wakin allin, wakin mana chayna allin.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allin runam karqa.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
He knew what was going on.	Payqa yacharqanmi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I’m not sure about that.	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu kani.
He did it right.	Allintam ruwarqa.
I know you want that	Yachanim chayta munasqaykita
I want it so much	Anchatam munani
He refused to go with her.	Payqa manan munarqanchu paywan riyta.
He was alone, as ever.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa, ñawpaq hina.
I hope so, I hope so	Chayta suyachkani, chayta suyachkani
You were a bigger person than me.	Qamqa ñuqamanta aswan hatun runam karqanki.
You know what, no.	Yachanki imata, mana.
I can’t believe it	Manam creeyta atiymanchu
He is happy about something.	Payqa imamantapas kusisqam kachkan.
I think it is wrong.	Mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
I couldn’t really say	Manam chiqaptaqa niyta atirqanichu
I didn’t see this coming	Manam rikurqanichu kay hamunanta
I'll be there tomorrow.	Paqarin punchawmi kasaq.
I thought he would do that	Chayta ruwananpaqmi yuyaykurqani
I want to go there too	Ñuqapas chayman riyta munani
I can't speak for very long. 	Manam ancha unayta rimayta atinichu. 
I just knew there was something here	Chaylla yacharqanim kaypi imapas kasqanmanta
He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi karqa.
I couldn’t say why, really.	Manam niyta atirqanichu imarayku, chiqaptapuni.
I didn’t want to talk to him	Manam paywan rimayta munarqanichu
I was never good at this	Manam haykapipas kaypiqa allinchu karqani
But you never know for sure.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas allintachu yachanki.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
I knew why he did it	Yacharqanim imanasqa chayta ruwasqanmanta
Obviously it wasn’t good.	Sut’inmi mana allinchu karqan.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
It’s not that simple.	Manan chay hina facilchu.
It doesn’t matter.	Manan imananpaschu.
You may never know	Ichapas mana haykapipas yachankichu
I was a man and something else	Runa karqani huk imapas
He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi kasqa.
Every morning they .	Sapa paqarinmi paykunaqa .
I'll do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwasaq.
He doesn’t want to.	Payqa manam munanchu.
He says he’s busy.	Payqa nin ocupasqa kashasqanmanta.
He didn’t want this.	Payqa manan kayta munarqanchu.
It’s going to be tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kanqa.
I know no one knows about this	Yachanim kaymanta mana pipas yachasqanmanta
I know you are scared.	Yachanim mancharisqa kasqaykita.
That’s the way it is.	Chayna kay.
I like it quite a bit	Allintam gustan
I didn’t see that coming.	Manam chay hamunanta rikurqanichu.
I hope you are well.	Suyachkani allin kasqaykita.
I really didn’t know.	Chiqaptaqa manam yacharqanichu.
I know it will be the only thing	Yachanim chaylla kananta
I never thought anything about it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa imatapas yuyaykurqanichu.
I hope he wins.	Suyachkani atipananta.
However, he refused.	Ichaqa, manan munarqanchu.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
A week ago, he didn’t know where he was	Huk semana ñawpaqtaqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta
I wish you were here with me	Munaymanmi kaypi ñoqawan kasqaykita
But it may not be a good idea.	Ichaqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.

Not like it is now.	Mana kunan hinachu.

I didn’t want to talk	Manam rimayta munarqanichu
I didn’t want to say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta munarqanichu.

He didn’t seem worried at all.	Payqa manan imapipas llakisqa hinachu karqan.

Something like that, yeah.	Imapas chayna, arí.
You know very well how important it is.	Qamqa allintam yachanki chayna ancha allin kasqanmanta.
I think this is true	Kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
I did it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwarqani.
This is a great day.	Kayqa hatun punchawmi.

I didn’t want to be yours	Manam qampaq kayta munarqanichu
I really couldn't tell you why	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
I can’t tell you what it is	Manam willayta atinichu ima kasqanmanta
It’s good, though.	Allinmi ichaqa.
I can’t tell you.	Manam willayta atiymanchu.
I know what’s coming	Yachanim ima hamunanta
They are scared and worried.	Paykunaqa mancharisqa, llakisqa ima kachkanku.
I don’t want to do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munanichu.
This doesn't seem right.	Kayqa mana allinchu rikchakun.
I almost certainly did	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqani
I knew what he was going to do	Yacharqanim ima ruwananta
He had to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
He wants it right.	Payqa allintam munan.
I didn’t want to believe it	Manam creeyta munarqanichu
I really like him as a person	Anchatan gustan huk runa hina
I really wanted that	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa munarqani
What is that.	Imataq chay.
How things are going.	Imaynataq imapas kachkan.
I knew this was not going to be easy	Yacharqanim kayqa mana facilchu kananta
I don’t know what it’s like yet	Manaraqmi yachanichu imayna kasqanmantaqa
However, the process would not last long.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa unaytachu kanman.
If only he were with me now.	Sichus kunan ñoqawan kanman karqan chayqa.
Everything remained the same.	Tukuy imapas hinallam karqa.

But he didn’t think about it.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu.
You can't tell how many there are.	Manam hayka kasqanmantaqa yachayta atiwaqchu.
I am very sorry now	Kunanqa anchatam llakikuni
I really want to be here.	Anchatan munani kaypi kayta.
I don’t think that would be right.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman, nispan yuyaykuni.
I knew why, too much had happened	Yacharqanim imarayku, llumpay pasasqanmanta
Yeah, now and then that’s it.	Arí, kunan chaymanta chaylla.
Yeah, something like that.	Arí, imapas chayna kaq.
It was wonderful to be with him again.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa hukmanta paywan kayqa.
Now, however, it is now.	Kunanmi ichaqa kunan.
Maybe he doesn’t know what it’s like.	Ichapas mana yachanchu imayna kasqanmanta.
If you do that.	Sichus chayta ruwanki chayqa.
And he did it.	Hinan payqa ruwarqan.
But that was nice.	Ichaqa chayqa sumaqmi karqan.
This should continue.	Kayqa hinallam kanan.
I have to do it, you know	Ñuqaqa ruwanay tiyan, chayta yachanki
He didn’t know where he was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
I knew what he wanted.	Yacharqanim ima munasqanmanta.
But no, nothing.	Ichaqa manan, manan imapas.
It’s not always the best way to do it though.	Manan sapa kutichu aswan allin ruway ichaqa.
I had to do a few	Iskay kimsa ruwanay karqa
I didn’t know they were there	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi kasqankuta
Everything should be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanan.
No one wants to talk.	Manam pipas rimayta munanchu.
Here’s one that doesn’t.	Kaypi huk mana chayta ruwaq.
Something is seriously wrong.	Imapas sinchi mana allinmi kachkan.
I don’t want to be any different	Manam huk hina kaytaqa munanichu
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
But it wasn’t bad.	Ichaqa manan mana allinchu karqan.

He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
I know what happened	Yachanim imakuna pasasqanmanta
I wanted to do more	Aswan ruwayta munarqani
I didn't know what it was at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manam yacharqanichu ima kasqanmanta
I can't help this anymore	Manañam kayta yanapayta atiymanchu
Then another person.	Chaymanta huk runa.
I couldn’t believe it was real	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chiqap kasqanmanta
You don't know this.	Kaytaqa manam yachankichu.
It’s a very bad thing.	Ancha mana allin kaq.

I want to do this today	Kunan punchawmi kayta ruwanayta munani
I wonder a lot about it.	Achkatam chaymanta tapukuni.
I think he was married to her	Yuyaykuni paywan casarasqa kasqanmanta
No you can’t.	Manan manan atiwaqchu.
I know this for a fact	Kaytaqa allintam yachani
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
He can’t do it.	Mana ruwayta atinchu.
I don't know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He could never have done that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
What! 	Ima!
How did he do it.	Imaynatataq ruwarqa.
I’m sure he’ll do well.	Seguro kani allinta ruwananmanta.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan.
Something will happen.	Imapas kanqa.
I know as well as anyone.	Pipas hinam allinta yachani.
I'll be a good person	Allin runam kasaq
He said he was very busy.	Payqa nirqam ancha ocupasqa kasqanmanta.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
He wasn't supposed to be here.	Payqa manam kaypichu kanan karqa.
Do this regularly.	Kayta sapa kuti ruway.
I know you're not there.	Yachanim mana chaypi kasqaykita.

I was happy that everything was fine	Kusisqam karqani tukuy imapas allin kasqanmanta
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
But you can’t do anything about it.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I really want to win.	Anchatan munani atipayta.
Very, very bad.	Ancha, ancha mana allin.
Maybe it doesn’t exist.	Ichapas mana kanchu.
But I'm pretty sure it doesn't.	Ichaqa ancha segurom kachkani mana kasqanmanta.
He could never get over it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chayta atipayta atirqanchu.
I know what kind of person you are	Yachanim imayna runa kasqaykita
I hope you are not	Suyachkani mana chayna kasqaykita
No more than that.	Mana aswan chaymantaqa.

I want to do this job.	Kay llamkayta ruwayta munani.
That is still not easy.	Chayqa kunankamapas manam facilchu.
I wanted to know where he was	Maypi kasqanmanta yachayta munarqani

This has been around for a long time.	Kayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi kachkan.
I know enough to do that	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi allinta yachani
I didn’t know what that was all about	Manam yacharqanichu imamanta chay kasqanmantaqa
He was really here.	Payqa chiqaptam kaypi karqa.
I knew the consequences	Yacharqanim chaymanta imakuna kananta
I highly doubt that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam iskayrayani.
The doer of the	Chay ruwaq.
All over the place.	Tukuy chaypi.
I didn’t see it coming	Manam hamunanta rikurqanichu
This was a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi karqa.
If it does, that’s great.	Sichus chayta ruwan chayqa, chayqa ancha allinmi.
He doesn’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachanchu.
I didn’t want to talk about it	Manam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu
But he had to do it.	Ichaqa chayta ruwanan karqan.
You don’t know.	Manam yachankichu.
I still can’t do it.	Kunankamapas manam atinichu.
But that’s what you have to do.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwanayki.
I think that's probably so bad	Chayqa ichapas chayna mana allin kasqanmanta piensani
He was a nice guy.	Payqa sumaq runam karqa.
I almost know that it is	Yaqapaschá yachani chayna kasqanmanta
I mean, we’re good together	Niyta munani, kuska allin kanchik
I didn’t know about it.	Manam chaymantaqa yacharqanichu.
He had to do it.	Payqa ruwanan karqan.
Very nice thing.	Ancha sumaq kaq.
It can’t be true.	Mana chiqap kayta atinchu.
I knew something was going to happen	Yacharqanim imapas pasananta
That there is nothing else.	Mana imapas huk kasqanmanta.
I want it to be really quick	Munani chiqap utqaylla kananta
I want to talk about it	Chaymanta rimayta munani
Alright.	Allinmi.
This means something.	Kayqa imapas niyta munan.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I just wasn’t sure why.	Chaylla mana segurochu karqani imarayku.
Maybe it’s better to just say it.	Ichapas allin kanman chaylla niyta.
It’s not the easiest.	Manam aswan facilchu.
I want to do something	Imatapas ruwayta munani
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I didn’t know anything about it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqanichu
He was here today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi kaypi karqa.
I didn’t mean to say.	Ama niyta munarqanichu.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
I couldn’t talk to him anymore	Manañam paywan rimayta atirqanichu
Indeed, he was.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa karqan.
And he said yes.	Hinan payqa arí nisqa.
He’ll be there.	Payqa chaypi kanqa.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Two weeks, at most three.	Iskay semana, aswan achka kimsa.
I don't really know why.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
That he would do it.	Chayta ruwananta.
It’s not here to stay.	Manam kaypichu kachkan.
But this was not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan kayqa.
If you were like some of that.	Sichus wakin chaymanta chay hina karqanki.
I'm sure he thinks so.	Seguro kani chayna piensasqanmanta.
But it wasn’t easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu karqan.
All right, we’re all right.	Allinmi, allinmi kayku.
It was a long time ago.	Unayñan karqan.
I hadn’t thought of that	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu
I didn’t know that.	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu.
I would never have done that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa
I said goodnight.	Allin tuta nispaymi nirqani.
But I’m never like that	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu kani
But he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I wasn’t happy anymore	Manañam kusisqachu karqani
He was here last year.	Payqa qayna wata kaypi karqa.
I'm all over there I've ever been	Ñuqaqa tukuy chaypi kani haykapipas karqani
I didn’t want to tell you	Manam willayta munarqanichu
I should have done that a long time ago	Unayñan chaytaqa ruwanay karqan
That wasn’t the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
It may not be right for you.	Yaqapaschá mana qampaq allinchu kanman.
I didn’t know what it was	Manam yacharqanichu ima kasqanmantaqa
Maybe it never is.	Ichapas mana haykapipas kanchu.
He had to do it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chayta ruwanan karqan.
It looked good.	Allinmi rikchakurqa.
I couldn’t be happier	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atirqanichu
That was supposed to be his real name.	Chayqa chiqap sutinmi kanan karqa.
Maybe it’s up to me	Ichapas ñuqamanta kanqa
I think he’s on to something.	Yuyaykuni imapipas kashasqanmanta.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
What really happened.	Imakuna chiqap pasasqanmanta.
I am a happier person	Aswan kusisqa runam kani
I didn’t want to do it.	Manam ruwayta munarqanichu.
I was so nervous, nervous and excited.	Ancha mancharisqa, mancharisqa, kusisqa ima karqani.
I can’t tell you what’s going to happen	Manam willayta atiymanchu imakuna pasananta
You don’t quite know what to say.	Mana allintachu yachanki ima niyta.
He does what he says he will do.	Nisqanman hinam ruwan.
What’s the possibility.	¿Imataq kanman.
I think it is everything	Ñuqaqa tukuy ima kasqanmantam piensani
No one is ever right or wrong.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
But no, it wasn’t.	Ichaqa manan, manan chay hinachu karqan.
I don’t want to be about that	Manam chaymantaqa munanichu
The practice continues today.	Kunankamapas chay ruwayqa hinallam kachkan.
I'm sure yours isn't.	Seguro kani qampaq kaq mana kasqanmanta.
I didn’t know what he was going to do	Manam yacharqanichu ima ruwananta

It’s not right for you.	Manam qampaq hinachu.

It just doesn’t.	Chaylla mana.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Now I know everything.	Kunanqa tukuy imatam yachani.
Isn’t that something? 	¿Manachu chayqa imapas?
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
I thought maybe it would all work out	Yuyarqanim ichapas tukuy imapas allin kanman nispa
But, that doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa, chayqa manan imananpaschu.
A lot went wrong.	Achkatam mana allintachu rirqa.
I can’t deal with that now	Chaytaqa manan kunanqa atipayta atiymanchu
That would be better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
They are in town now.	Kunanqa llaqtapi kachkanku.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
He is a.	Payqa huk.

I was hurt and angry	K’irisqa, phiñasqa ima karqani
I can't believe he's here	Manam creeyta atinichu kaypi kasqanmanta
I had no intention of doing that	Manam chayta ruwanaypaqqa yuyaykurqanichu

Three, actually.	Kimsa, chiqaptaqa.
He was really angry.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin phiñasqa kasharqan.
I didn’t want this to be about me	Manam munarqanichu kay ñuqamanta kananta

Please, please, please.	Ama hina kaspa, nispa.
I'm not sure that's a bad thing	Manam segurochu kani chay mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I know you want that	Yachanim chayta munasqaykita
Maybe he did just that.	Ichapas payqa chayta ruwarqa.
It should be a good one.	Allinmi kanan.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqa.

I've been waiting all day	Tukuy punchawmi suyachkani
I’m not a good guy.	Manam allinchu kani.

I couldn’t really say.	Manam chiqaptaqa niyta atirqanichu.
But no one could be sure.	Ichaqa manan pipas seguro kayta atirqanchu.

I want the timing to be good	Munani chay tiempo allin kananta
I am so sorry for what happened	Anchatan llakikuni imachus pasasqanmanta
It didn’t go very well.	Manam ancha allintachu rirqa.
Hopefully it would have been good.	Munaymanmi allin kanman karqan.

Both of them.	Iskayninku.
I couldn’t talk about it to anyone.	Manam pimanpas chaymantaqa rimayta atirqanichu.

That’s all it really does.	Chaylla chiqaptapuni ruwan.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu.
Where is it located.	Maypitaq kachkan.
He wasn't sure he could do that.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa.
I want it to be there	Chaypi kananta munani
I didn't know that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantaqa manam yacharqanichu
Or is it, is it?.	Icha, ¿kanchu?.
I will do that more often	Chaytaqa aswan sapa kutim ruwasaq

But he knew it.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
He refused to say anything	Payqa manan imatapas rimayta munarqanchu
That’s the most interesting thing.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi.
I hope you do that	Suyachkani chayta ruwanaykipaq
I knew it would happen, someday	Yacharqanim chayna kananta, huk punchaw
Do you really want that?.	¿Cheqaqtachu chayta munanki?.
The worst part of it.	Aswan mana allin kaq.
I did, really.	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani, chiqaptapuni.
It doesn’t mean anything.	Manam imatapas niyta munanchu.
Maybe he’s tired	Ichapas sayk’usqa kashan
He is doing something right.	Payqa allintam imatapas ruwachkan.

Don't you want that to happen.	Manachu munanki chayna kananta.

I couldn’t believe how successful he was	Mana creeyta atirqanichu allin ruwasqanmanta
In the morning.	Kusikuni.
He didn’t come here very often.	Payqa manan ancha sapa kutichu kayman hamuq.

I know you’re doing the right thing	Yachanim allinta ruwasqaykita
I didn’t know why.	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
I can’t do that now	Chaytaqa manan kunanqa ruwaymanchu
I wonder if it could be here	Tapukuni, kaypichu kanman nispa
Maybe he wasn’t happy	Ichapas mana kusisqachu karqa
You are something.	Qamqa imapas kanki.
Wouldn’t that be nice?.	¿Manachu chayqa sumaq kanman?.
I doubt it.	Iskayrayani.

No one knows this.	Kaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
If you really want to.	Sichus chiqaptapuni munanki chayqa.
I’m feeling really good	Ñuqaqa chiqap allinmi kachkani
There is nothing about it.	Manam chaymantaqa kanchu.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
I want to do something	Imatapas ruwayta munani
I’m not good enough.	Mana allinchu kani.
He would have to do something now.	Payqa kunanmi imatapas ruwanan kanman karqan.
He said he didn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu nirqan.
They would be obvious.	Paykunaqa sut’inmi kanman.
I knew where he lived, now	Yacharqanim maypi yachasqanmanta, kunanqa
But that was a long time ago.	Ichaqa chayqa unayñan karqan.
I couldn’t say anything	Manam imatapas niyta atirqanichu
I am fine.	Allinmi kachkani.
I didn’t want that to be true.	Manam munarqanichu chay chiqap kananpaq.

That couldn’t be worse.	Chayqa manan aswan mana allinchu kanman.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.

It’s like anything else.	Imapas hinam.

I am very happy about this.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kaymanta.

Something was good.	Imapas allinmi karqa.
However, things can go wrong.	Ichaqa, imapas mana allinchu kanman.
I wonder how it will turn out	Tapukuni imaynataq kanqa nispa
Do it right.	Allinta ruway.
I mean, everything	Niyta munani, tukuy imata
That’s a very good, good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi, allinmi.

But nothing worked out.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu karqan.
What’s the bad thing about it.	Imataq mana allin kaq.
I love it, too	Ñuqapas anchatam munani
No one feels at home now.	Kunanqa manam pipas wasinpi hinachu kachkan.
He wasn’t really.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu karqan.
I think he knew.	Payqa yacharqanmi, nispan yuyaykuni.
I wonder what he’ll do about it.	Tapukuni imatataq chaymanta ruwanqa nispa.
I really want to do that	Anchatan munani chayta ruwayta
Very often.	Ancha achka kuti.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Both are extremely difficult.	Iskayninkum sinchi sasa kanku.

Now it was clear what had happened.	Kunanqa sut’inmi karqan imachus pasasqanmanta.
Can you beat it.	Atiwaqchu atipayta.
I’m so excited about it	Anchatam kusisqa kachkani
I knew what he was doing.	Yacharqanim ima ruwasqanmanta.

He really wanted to talk to her today.	Payqa anchatan munarqan kunan p’unchay paywan rimayta.
I know what he wants.	Yachanim ima munasqanmanta.
Never mind how many there are.	Ama hayk’aqpas hayk’a kasqanmantaqa.
I know enough not to do that.	Chaytaqa mana ruwanaypaqmi allinta yachani.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
I knew it would be good	Yacharqanim allin kananta
Clearly something is very, very wrong there.	Sut’inmi chaypi imapas ancha, ancha mana allin kasqanmanta.
But I didn’t know.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanichu.
I didn’t see anyone	Manam pitapas rikurqanichu
That’s a nice thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi.
I’ve never seen that before.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu.
I just didn’t know what was wrong	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imachus mana allin kasqanmanta
He knew something was going to happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi imapas kananta.
I couldn't believe it would ever happen	Manam creeyta atirqanichu haykapipas chayna kananta
I'm really looking forward to it.	Chiqaptam chayta suyachkani.

I couldn’t figure out what was going on	Manam atirqanichu imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta
I couldn’t believe it	Manam creeyta atirqanichu
I can't believe anyone would do this	Manam creeyta atiymanchu pipas kayta ruwananta
We’ve been married for a long time now.	Unayñan casarasqa kayku kunanqa.
I really think it's better.	Chiqaptam piensani aswan allin kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want that	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu
He knew it was wonderful.	Payqa yacharqanmi ancha sumaq kasqanmanta.
That’s what it’s going to be.	Chayqa kanqa.
Did the man look good.	Runa allinchu rikchakurqa.
With him.	Paywan.
But there’s nothing here.	Ichaqa manan imapas kaypiqa kanchu.
I said, maybe tomorrow	nispaymi nirqani, ichapas paqarin
Perhaps things should have been better now.	Ichapas kunanqa imapas allinchu kanan karqa.
This is obvious.	Kayqa sut’inmi.
I always hope it happens	Sapa kutim suyachkani chayna kananta
It may not be the case.	Manapaschá chay hinachu kanman.
But you are not like that person.	Ichaqa manan chay runa hinachu kanki.
Maybe a lot of it.	Ichapas achka.

This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
I want to tell you.	Willayta munani.
I knew what he was doing.	Yacharqanim ima ruwasqanmanta.

I don’t like it now.	Kunanqa manam gustawanchu.
This was a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi karqa.
He obviously agreed	Payqa sut’inmi arí nisqa
He is a human being.	Payqa runam.
It doesn’t matter anymore	Manañam imananpaschu
I will certainly do it.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwasaq.
I hadn’t thought of that	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu
What’s more, you may not know why.	Imataq aswan, manapaschá yachankichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
That seems obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi rikch’akun.
Not sure why.	Mana segurochu imarayku.
That’s what he wants to do.	Chaytan payqa ruwayta munan.
I still didn’t know anything	Kunankamapas manam imatapas yacharqanichu
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
If something goes wrong.	Sichus imapas mana allinchu kanman chayqa.
Now, it hardly seemed right.	Kunanqa, yaqapaschá mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
It was rather lonely.	Aswan sapallanmi karqa.
I knew what they were like	Yacharqanim imayna kasqankuta
It’s not good, it’s not bad.	Manam allinchu, manam mana allinchu.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
He said something to her.	Payqa imatapas nirqam.
I’m sorry, but he can’t.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa manan atinchu.
I know how things are.	Yachanim imapas imayna kasqanmanta.
I just couldn’t believe it.	Chaylla mana creeyta atirqanichu.
Probably nothing.	Yaqapaschá mana imapas.
It is.	Kayqa.
That was something else.	Chayqa huk imapas karqa.
That would never be a good thing.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanman.
I really want to know.	Chiqaptam yachayta munani.
I would love to go with you	Anchatan munani qanwan riyta
He wanted it very much.	Payqa anchatam munarqa.
I didn't know anyone else was here	Manam yacharqanichu pipas huk kaypi kasqanmanta
He did a good job of that.	Payqa allin chayta ruwarqa.
But it isn’t.	Ichaqa manan.
I still didn't know what he was doing, what he was doing	Kunankamapas manam yacharqanichu ima ruwasqanmanta, ima ruwasqanmanta
I didn’t want money	Manam qullqita munarqanichu
I am a real person.	Chiqap runam kani.

I didn’t know he would	Manam yacharqanichu chayta ruwananta

He was angry.	Payqa phiñasqa.

But now it was very unlikely.	Ichaqa kunanqa ancha manapaschá chay hinachu karqan.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu.
I can’t tell you.	Manam willayta atinichu.
I really wanted to help	Anchatam yanapayta munarqani
I wanted to know everything	Tukuy imamanta yachayta munarqani
Hopefully it never happens	Munaymanmi mana haykapipas chayna kananta
It was never going to be the same.	Manan hayk’aqpas huk hinachu kanan karqan.
I could never make it happen	Manam haykapipas chayta ruwanaypaqqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I can't believe he's really gone	Manam creeyta atinichu chiqaptapuni manaña kasqanmantaqa
I know I can’t.	Yachanim mana atisqayta.
There is no third person.	Manam kimsa kaq runa kanchu.

It wasn’t that good.	Manam chayna allinchu karqa.

Alright.	Allinmi.

He would probably do that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwanman.
Yes they are.	Arí paykunaqa kanku.

He didn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.

I couldn't believe it	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atirqanichu

I’m really excited.	Chiqaptam kusisqa kachkani.

I wanted it so badly	Sinchitan munarqani

I don’t really know what he’s doing.	Mana allintachu yachani ima ruwasqanmanta.
He was injured.	Payqa k’irisqa kasqa.
I wanted to know more	Astawan yachayta munarqani
Nothing has ever been so simple.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu karqan.
I'm sure it's good	Seguro kani allin kasqanmanta
I was very nice	Ancha sumaqmi karqani
I'm sure there's nothing	Seguro kani mana imapas kasqanmanta
I know what happened.	Yachanim imakuna pasasqanmanta.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I think about being alone	Sapallan kaypi yuyaykuni
I couldn’t do it before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manam atirqanichu.
No, please.	Manan, ama.
He didn’t think of that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa yuyaykurqanchu.
An object is unique or not.	Huk imapas sapallanmi icha manachu.
Isn’t that great?.	¿Manachu chayqa ancha hatun?.
No, he’s not happy.	Manan, manan kusisqachu.
It just went on and on.	Chayqa hinallam rirqa.
I think there are three	Kimsa kasqanmantam piensani
I pretty much know that	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá yachani
I mean, of course.	Niyta munani, sut’inmi.
Very, very sad.	Ancha, ancha llakisqa.
I don’t know what it’s like	Manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmantaqa
I mean great.	Hatun niyta munani.
Someone else will do it.	Huk runam ruwanqa.
Just not sure what that would be.	Chaylla mana segurochu imachus chay kananmanta.
I'm happy with how it turned out.	Kusisqam kachkani imayna kasqanmanta.
I thought it was really hard	Cheqaqtapunin sinchi sasa kasqanmanta yuyaykurqani
I thought you were someone else	Huk runa kasqaykita yuyaykurqani
I was hurt and angry.	K’irisqa, phiñasqa ima karqani.
I wanted to tell you.	Willayta munarqani.
I did something today	Kunan punchawmi imatapas ruwarqani
But it doesn’t work here.	Ichaqa manan kaypiqa allinchu.
Like really bad.	Chiqap mana allin hina.
I almost wanted him to	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwananta munarqani
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He can't help it.	Mana yanapayta atinchu.
Like a depressed person	Huk llakisqa runa hina
I can't believe that	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atiymanchu
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
I would never have done that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa
I am well aware that this is a very difficult task.	Allintam yachani kay ruwayqa ancha sasa kasqanmanta.
He kept going.	Payqa hinallam rirqa.
But I don’t know how to do it.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imayna ruwayta.
He doesn’t care, really.	Payqa manan imananpaschu, cheqaqtapunin.
It was great to be there	Chaypi kayqa ancha allinmi karqa
I wish he never did	Munaymanmi mana haykapipas ruwananta
I don’t really know.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani.
Now, I don’t care about that.	Kunanqa, manan chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
He said it was okay.	Payqa allinmi nisqa.
I've never seen him now	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu kunanqa
He was supposed to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwananpaqmi kasqa.
You’re either there.	Qamqa icha chaypi kachkanki.
Next year, maybe.	Hamuq wata, ichapas.
I better ask myself	Aswan allinmi tapukuni
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
An injury perhaps.	Huk k’irisqa ichapas.
I’ve always been like that	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqani
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I didn’t know it would be so overwhelming for you	Manam yacharqanichu chayna llumpayta qampaq kananta
I think he would have done that.	Chaytaqa ruwanman karqan nispan yuyaykuni.
I thought something was wrong.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He couldn’t have done that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
A nice feature	Huk sumaq ruway
I don’t want it to be someone else	Manam munanichu huk runa kananta
I don’t want money	Manam qullqita munanichu
Now he knew that wouldn't happen.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi chay mana pasananta.
That’s all.	Chaylla.
He is very happy about it.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan chaymanta.
But it’s not quite right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu.
I wasn't so sure anymore	Manañam chayna segurochu karqani
He is the nicest person.	Payqa aswan sumaq runam.
That would be the worst.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
This was a wonderful day.	Kay punchawqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
I couldn't believe what was happening	Manam creeyta atirqanichu imakuna pasasqanmanta
He loves to talk.	Rimayta anchata munan.
I don’t know why.	Mana yachanichu imarayku.
I think he did that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwasqanmanta.
That nothing would happen.	Mana imapas pasananta.
I think that's his name	Chayqa sutinmi nispaymi piensani
I knew what was involved	Yacharqanim chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta
I didn’t really think about that	Chaytaqa manan allintachu yuyaykurqani
I mean, you want to tell someone	Niyta munani, pimanpas willayta munanki
I should have done it more often	Aswan sapa kutim ruwanay karqa
It went well, apparently.	Allintam rirqa, yaqapaschá.
He did it right	Chaytaqa allintam ruwarqa
I know you are right	Yachanim allin kasqaykita
You are the person who is always never there.	Qamqa kanki sapa kuti mana haykapipas chaypi kaq runa.
Is it right or wrong.	¿Allinchu icha manachu.
I didn’t know what was wrong	Manam yacharqanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta
I’m very tired and overwhelmed	Ancha sayk’usqa, llumpay llakisqa ima kachkani
I should have done that a long time ago.	Unayñan chaytaqa ruwanay karqan.
Everything would be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanman.
No one cares about it.	Manan pipas imananpaschu.
I think you can go now	Yuyaykuni kunan riyta atisqaykita
It didn’t take long.	Mana unaytachu ruwarqa.
I can't talk about it now	Kunanqa manam chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu
I did everything alone	Sapallanmi tukuy imatapas ruwarqani
But he could never say that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayta niyta atirqanchu.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu.
I never knew what it was.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
I said it didn’t matter	Manam imananpaschu nispaymi nirqani

I was very excited.	Ancha kusisqam karqani.
I hope it was good	Suyachkani allin kasqanmanta
Maybe this is a good thing.	Ichapas kayqa allin kanman.
I know you can do the job	Yachanim chay llamkayta ruwayta atisqaykita
That could have been anything.	Chayqa imapas kanman karqa.
The action is beautiful.	Ruwayqa sumaqmi.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
I couldn't believe how fast they were	Manam creeyta atirqanichu imayna utqaylla kasqankuta
I don't know if this thing exists.	Mana yachanichu kay imapas kanchu icha manachu.
That’s what he wanted.	Chaytan payqa munarqan.
But he couldn't be sure.	Ichaqa manan seguro kayta atirqanchu.
But it’s not really like that.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chhayna.
That wasn’t quite the case.	Chayqa manan allintachu karqan.
Tonight morning, then tonight.	Kunan tuta paqarin, chaymanta kunan tuta.
Everyone is everyone.	Tukuy runa tukuy runa.
I had no idea what it was about	Manam piensarqanichu imamanta chayna kasqanmantaqa
It wasn’t very good.	Mana ancha allinchu karqa.
No, two things.	Manan, iskay imakuna.
I don’t know how it is.	Manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmanta.
You know that, you know.	Chaytaqa yachanki.
Nothing can do it.	Manan imapas atinchu.
I doubt that is the case	Iskayrayani chayna kasqanmanta
It was a good day.	Allin punchawmi karqa.
It wasn’t really like that.	Manan cheqaqtachu chhayna karqan.
I thought he knew what you were doing.	Yuyarqanim ruwasqaykita yachasqanmanta.
But he acts quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwan.
But you never really know.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu yachanki.
Well? 	Allin?
I have a way to do this	Kayta ruwanaypaqqa imaynatachus ruwanay tiyan
If you don’t want to.	Mana munaspaqa.
I wasn’t sure of anything	Manam imamantapas segurochu karqani
If you don’t want to, then don’t.	Mana munaspaqa, chaymanta ama.
But he knew that wouldn't happen.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana chay pasananta.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Ichapas, ichapas, ichapas.
Really, I loved it	Chiqaptam, anchatam munarqani
A really bad night.	Chiqap mana allin tuta.
Actually, it’s fine.	Chiqaptaqa, allinmi.
I don't want to talk now.	Manam kunanqa rimayta munanichu.
I don’t know what to say.	Manam yachanichu ima niyta.

That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
More than a little bit.	Aswan huk chikan.

He wanted to speak quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan rimayta munarqan.
I mean, he didn’t think about it	Niyta munani, payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu
That’s better than nothing.	Chayqa aswan allinmi mana imamantapas.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
I couldn’t speak	Manam rimayta atirqanichu
Maybe it should be.	Ichapas chayna kanan.
I know it is true	Yachanim chiqap kasqanmanta
But it probably isn’t.	Ichaqa manapaschá.
He was everything.	Payqa tukuy imapas karqa.

You know, you know.	Yachanki, yachanki.

I just wasn’t sure it was safe here	Chaylla mana segurochu karqani kaypi segurochu kasqanmanta

I am very sad and worried	Ancha llakisqa, llakisqa ima kachkani
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
I can’t do that anymore	Manañan chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
He was terrified.	Payqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
He’s the one.	Payqa.
I’m more afraid of what he’s doing	Aswan manchakuni ima ruwasqanmanta
He says he doesn’t know.	Mana yachanichu nin.
No one knew what that meant.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu chay ima niyta munasqanmanta.
The process was wonderful	Chay ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi karqan
I had no idea it was	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chay kasqanmanta
I know he knows.	Yachanim payqa yachasqanmanta.
I really wonder how true it is.	Chiqaptam tapukuni imayna chiqap kasqanmanta.

He really, really said that.	Payqa chiqaptam, chiqaptam chayta nirqa.
But it’s not really like that.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chhayna.
It’s a very good one.	Ancha allinmi.

No, that wouldn’t be right.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu kanman.

Please forgive me.	Ama hina kaspa pampachaykuway.
That’s what he did.	Chaytan payqa ruwarqan.
But I doubt it is	Ichaqa iskayrayani chayna kasqanmanta
I didn’t want to do it again	Manam hukmanta ruwayta munarqanichu
Maybe it was too fast.	Ichapas ancha utqaylla karqa.
But I’m not sure	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani
They are both of them.	Iskayninkum kanku.
I said that was wrong.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam nirqani.
But okay, okay.	Ichaqa allinmi, allinmi.
No, no, no, no.	Mana, mana, mana.
I actually thought it was great.	Chiqaptaqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I knew something seemed very good	Yacharqanim imapas ancha allin hina kasqanmanta

I mean that in a better way	Chaytaqa aswan allinta niyta munani
He didn’t want this man to be with him.	Payqa manan munarqanchu kay runa paywan kuska kananta.

I know you want someone to do everything right	Yachanim pipas tukuy imata allinta ruwananta munasqaykita
I didn’t really want that.	Manam chiqaptachu chaytaqa munarqani.

He didn’t do it right	Payqa manan allintachu ruwarqan
I think they’re both gone.	Iskayninku manaña kasqankuta yuyani.

Indeed, it was.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.

He’s, like.	Payqa, hina.
I’m not really sure about that.	Manam chiqaptaqa chaymantaqa segurochu kani.

All right, yes.	Allinmi, arí.
But it would have been nice.	Ichaqa sumaqmi kanman karqan.
A bad day was anything	Mana allin punchawqa imapas karqa

I know how bad you want to be	Yachanim imayna mana allinta kayta munasqaykita
You’re doing a good job.	Allintam ruwanki.

I may not have said it right.	Manapaschá allintachu nirqani.
I did it right.	Allintam ruwarqani.
I didn’t want to be like that anymore.	Manañam chayna kaytaqa munarqanichu.
That seemed a little too good to be true.	Chayqa huk chikan ancha allinmi rikchakurqa chiqap kananpaq.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.

That’s not even.	Chay nitaq.

Not anymore of that.	Manaña chaymantaqa.
I don’t think that’s it.	Manam yuyanichu chaytaqa.
I wonder what he’s thinking	Tapukuni ima yuyaykusqanmanta
It was indeed the case.	Chiqaptam chayna karqa.
But he is not sure.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kashan.
Faster than that.	Chaymanta aswan utqaylla.
How are they going to be.	Imaynataq paykunaqa.

Maybe he could do it now.	Ichapas kunanqa ruwayta atinman karqa.
I may have to do it again	Yaqapaschá hukmanta ruwanay kanqa
I could never do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu

But you have to do it right.	Ichaqa allintam ruwanayki.

He said it was true.	Cheqaqtapunin nirqan.
This is just that.	Kayqa chaylla.
You think about something.	Imapipas yuyaykunki.

I didn’t know what was going to happen	Manam yacharqanichu ima pasananta
I had no idea how it would happen	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imayna pasananta
I knew he couldn't do much	Yacharqanim mana ancha ruway atisqanmanta
This should take about a week but probably no longer.	Kayqa yaqa huk semana hinam kanan ichaqa manapaschá aswan unaytachu.
I knew why, but I couldn't say anything	Yacharqanim imanasqa kasqanmanta, ichaqa manam imatapas niyta atirqanichu
He said everything about me was so great.	Payqa nirqam tukuy ima ñuqamanta ancha hatun kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t do that	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta atirqanichu

But he had to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
There was someone here.	Kaypiqa pipas kasqa.

I didn’t make much of it	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa ruwarqani
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I don’t know what that is, what it could have been.	Mana yachanichu imachus chay kasqanmanta, imachus kanman karqan chayta.

That wasn’t the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
Like the first one.	Ñawpaq kaq hina.
I doubt anyone will come today though	Iskayrayani kunan punchaw pipas hamunanta ichaqa
It was better than that.	Aswan allinmi karqa.

I thought, maybe.	Yuyarqanim, ichapas.
I don’t mean to say	Manam niyta munani
Now, not so much.	Kunanqa, mana anchatachu.

I didn’t want to talk to him	Manam paywan rimayta munarqanichu

You don’t really know that.	Chaytaqa manan allintachu yachanki.

I thought he seemed unsure about it.	Yuyarqanim mana seguro hinachu chaypi kasqanmanta.
But I knew it would happen	Ichaqa yacharqanim chayna kananta
Not.	Mana.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.

He wanted it, he wanted it.	Payqa munarqa, munarqa.
I can’t do anything about it	Manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu

For example.	Kay hina.

I didn’t want him to be there	Manam munarqanichu chaypi kananta
Someone else did it.	Huk runam chayta ruwarqa.
Now I know how bad it is	Kunanqa yachanim chayna mana allin kasqanmanta
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He says it’s not the first time he’s done this.	Payqa nin manan ñawpaq kutichu kayta ruwasqanmanta.
This is great, you think.	Kayqa ancha allinmi, nispan yuyaykunki.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
I can't get over how beautiful everything is	Tukuy imapas imayna sumaq kasqanmantaqa manam atipayta atiymanchu

He didn't want her to do that.	Payqa manan munarqanchu chayta ruwananta.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.

But it won’t be good.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanqa.
I really wanted to know that	Chaytaqa anchatam yachayta munarqani
Okay, never do that.	Allinmi, chayta mana hayk’aqpas ruway.

I didn’t mean this	Manam kayta niyta munarqanichu
Is that right?.	¿Allinchu chayna?.
I think he's injured.	Yuyaykuni k'irisqa kasqanmanta.
I suspect it is untrue.	Mana chiqap kasqanmantam sospechani.

He is a beautiful man.	Payqa sumaq runam.
You're going to be injured.	K'irisqa kanki.

Nothing always.	Mana imapas sapa kuti.
That’s really bad.	Chayqa chiqap mana allinmi.
But I stopped thinking about it	Ichaqa manañan chaypi yuyaykurqanichu
I said that it was	Chayna kasqanmantam nirqani
It seems every day.	Sapa punchawmi rikchakun.
I would never do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
It couldn't have been easier.	Manam aswan facilchu kanman karqa.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
I need to do that more often	Chaytaqa aswan sapa kutim ruwanay
Several times, in fact.	Achka kuti, chiqaptaqa.
But he must do it quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanan.
If not, please do.	Mana chayqa, ama hina kaspa ruway.

But he couldn’t do everything.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
I wanted to tell you about it	Chaymanta willayta munarqani
Less than nothing.	Mana imamanta aswan pisi.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
That wasn’t the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.

That’s what he can do.	Chaytan payqa ruwanman.

I couldn’t be that person	Manam chay runa kayta atiymanchu karqa

He couldn't be sure.	Payqa manan seguro kayta atirqanchu.
He probably did it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqan.
It doesn’t seem right.	Mana allinmi rikchakun.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
Now this is really bad.	Kunanqa kayqa chiqap mana allinmi.

He knew it wouldn’t happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kananta.
That was maybe, maybe, the right thing to do.	Chayqa ichapas, ichapas, allin ruway karqa.
Maybe that’s the right thing to do	Ichapas chayna allin kanman
I know you won't	Yachanim mana chayta ruwanaykipaq
I didn’t want to do it	Manam ruwayta munarqanichu
I have never been so happy	Manam haykapipas chayna kusisqachu karqani
Very realistic.	Ancha chiqap kaq.

One day it will be there.	Huk punchawmi chaypi kanqa.
It wasn’t very good.	Manam ancha allinchu karqa.
I still am, actually	Hinallam kachkani, chiqaptaqa
I'm not sure it's true	Manam segurochu kani chiqap kasqanmantaqa
I thought that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani
Didn’t see that coming.	Mana chay hamunanta rikurqanichu.
Maybe it’s too good.	Ichapas ancha allin.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I think it will be just that	Chaylla kanqa nispaymi piensani
Every other day for three weeks.	Sapa iskay punchawmi kimsa semana.
I thought he was very good	Payqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
I had no idea what he was going to do	Manam yuyaykurqanichu ima ruwananmanta
He had things to do.	Payqa imakuna ruwanan karqan.
I told her everything would be fine	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa nispaymi nirqani
It’s a good thing to do.	Allinmi chay ruwayqa.

He was still there.	Payqa hinallam karqa.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I still wasn't sure what he wanted	Hinallam mana segurochu karqani ima munasqanmanta
It’s not good anymore.	Manaña allinchu.
I sure didn’t plan to do this	Seguro mana kayta ruwayta yuyaykurqanichu
That’s what I wanted to do.	Chaytan ruwayta munarqani.
He wanted to know more.	Payqa astawan yachayta munarqa.

But not so well.	Ichaqa manan chay hina allintachu.
This would be a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu kanman.
I had to act quickly	Usqhayllan imatapas ruwanay karqan

It doesn’t matter why.	Manan imananpaschu imarayku.
But now he is .	Ichaqa kunanmi payqa .
That may not be the right thing to do.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
But I can’t say that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa niyta atiymanchu
It’s a good good one.	Allin allinmi.
Great guy.	Hatun runa.
That’s certainly not the case here.	Chayqa seguro manan kaypichu kashan.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I thought things might be difficult	Yuyarqanim imapas sasa kanman nispa
That looked really interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
You knew this.	Kaytaqa yacharqanki.

Married to her.	Paywan casarasqa.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I hadn’t thought it would happen yet	Manaraqmi piensarqanichu chayna kananta
Otherwise, it’s too bad.	Mana chayqa, ancha mana allinmi.
It doesn't seem that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu rikchakun.
He doesn’t know.	Payqa manan yachanchu.
But this wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allinchu kanman.
All year round.	Tukuy wata.
But it wasn’t easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu karqan.
But not this one.	Ichaqa manan kaytaqa.
I couldn’t really talk	Manam chiqaptaqa rimayta atirqanichu
I wasn’t good enough	Manam allinchu karqani

That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
I’m sorry about that.	Ñuqaqa chaymanta llakikuni.
It won’t be any different.	Manan huk hinachu kanqa.
I thought he was very severely injured	Yuyarqanin ancha sinchi k’irisqa kashasqanmanta
But that’s not a bad thing.	Ichaqa manan mana allinchu chayqa.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
I didn’t want to talk about it, either.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu, nitaq.

But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu.
I wonder if no one thought of this before	Tapukunitaqmi ñawpaqtaqa mana pipas kayta yuyaykusqanmanta
I was me and something else, something more	Ñuqaqa karqani ñuqapas huk imapas, imapas aswan
Maybe he was both.	Ichapas payqa iskayninku karqa.

I want him to succeed every time.	Sapa kuti allinta ruwananta munani.

I knew what he was doing	Yacharqanim ima ruwasqanmanta
Not sure what you mean by better.	Mana segurochu ima niyta munanki aswan allin nispa.

He’s not a good guy.	Payqa manam allinchu.
I didn’t know what he was going to do	Manam yacharqanichu ima ruwananta
That went really well.	Chayqa ancha allintam rirqa.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
I never wanted all this to happen, you know	Manam haykapipas tukuy kay pasananta munarqanichu, yachanki
It wasn’t very good at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan ancha allinchu karqan.
He had to do something	Imatapas ruwanan karqan
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
I wanted to talk to you first	Ñawpaqtaqa qanwan rimayta munarqani
I would never be good again	Manañam haykapipas allinchu kayman

He didn't do well here.	Kaypiqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.

I just wasn’t sure where it was	Chaylla mana segurochu karqani maypi kasqanmanta

He knew it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi.
I knew what was going to happen.	Yacharqanim imakuna pasananta.

I didn’t want to do this	Manam kayta ruwayta munarqanichu
But he certainly is.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin payqa.
I think he wanted to talk privately	Yuyaykuni sapallan rimayta munasqanmanta
The process is very interesting.	Chay ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I had no idea it was so late	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayna tarde kasqanmanta
I didn’t know what it was going to be like	Manam yacharqanichu imayna kananta

Maybe this, maybe that.	Ichapas kay, ichapas chay.
It’s actually pretty good.	Chiqaptaqa ancha allinmi.

That’s a very bad thing.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi.

I wasn’t that excited	Manam chayna kusisqachu karqani
I wasn’t always sure he could do it	Manam sapa kutichu seguro karqani chay ruway atisqanmanta
He is sure of it.	Payqa segurom kachkan.
I wonder what it is about me that causes it.	Tapukuni imataq ñuqamanta chayta ruwan.
This, he knew, would be the worst.	Kayqa, yacharqanmi, aswan mana allin kananta.
I think he knows everything.	Yuyaykuni tukuy imata yachan.

She was beautiful, but she wasn't.	Payqa sumaqmi karqan, ichaqa manan chay hinachu kasharqan.
He is long gone.	Payqa unayñan manaña kanchu.
I really want to do that	Anchatan munani chayta ruwayta
It was like every week.	Sapa semana hinam karqa.
No, it's not.	Manan, nispa.
He is doing great today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi ancha allinta ruwachkan.
I had no idea why	Manam piensarqanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa
Why is he.	¿Imanasqataq payqa.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
But it was supposed to be.	Ichaqa chayna kanan karqa.
He seemed very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
All right, he said.	Allinmi, nispa.
Everything is now.	Tukuy imapas kunanmi kachkan.
Maybe he wanted to.	Ichapas munarqa.
I wonder what they are	Tapukuni imakuna kasqankuta
I didn’t know he was married	Manam yacharqanichu casarasqa kasqanmanta
I can’t be human anymore	Manañam runa kayta atiymanchu
Now that’s something.	Kunanqa chayqa imapas.
He is alone.	Payqa sapallanmi.
He certainly is.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
No one knew where they were.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu maypi kasqankuta.
He was there, he was there.	Payqa chaypi kasqa, chaypi kasqa.
I think that is what it is.	Chayqa kasqanmantam piensani.
It just might be.	Chaylla ichapas kanman.
It makes a bigger amount of money.	Aswan hatun qullqita ruwan.
That’s not the case with this.	Chayqa manan kay hinachu.
This is the best.	Kayqa aswan allinmi.
Maybe there was someone there.	Ichapas chaypi pipas karqa.
Make sure you do it.	Chayta ruwanaykipaq hina ruway.
I was tired that day	Chay punchawmi sayk’usqa karqani
I didn’t really think anything of it	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu
He’s doing well.	Payqa allinmi kachkan.
It was like two people.	Iskay runa hinam karqa.
He’s not sure how many.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan hayk’a kasqanmantaqa.
I’m better off.	Aswan allinmi kani.
A beautiful day last year	Qayna wata huk sumaq punchaw
For example.	Kay hina.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
One of these.	Huk chaymanta.
I hadn’t thought of that	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu
That’s what I wanted to tell you	Chaytan willayta munarqani
It was a very great day.	Ancha hatun punchawmi karqa.
I know something is wrong	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam yachani
But he didn't know what to do.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.
He doesn't look very good, either.	Payqa manam ancha allinchu rikchakun, nitaq.
There is no one here.	Manam pipas kaypi kanchu.
They are both great.	Iskayninkum hatun kanku.
Do a nice job.	Sumaq llamkayta ruway.
That would do the trick.	Chayqa allintam ruwanman.
No, that’s not the worst part.	Manan, chayqa manan aswan mana allinchu.
But, what do I know.	Ichaqa, imatataq yachani.
I think you did what you could	Yuyaykuni atisqaykita ruwasqaykita
I didn’t know that at the time	Chaytaqa manan chay tiempopiqa yacharqanichu
I mean, everything.	Niyta munani, tukuy ima.
I wonder how it is	Imayna kasqanmantam tapukuni
I couldn’t be there	Manam chaypi kayta atirqanichu
This is still going on.	Kayqa hinallam kachkan.
You are a beautiful person.	Sumaq runam kanki.
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atirqanichu.
I know you are with him	Yachanim paywan kasqaykita
I really don't want to talk about this	Chiqaptaqa manam kaymanta rimayta munanichu
I don't think that's the case now.	Kunanqa manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensanichu.
This can be very useful.	Kayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
Maybe that’s what this is.	Ichapas chayna kayqa.
I think that's a great thing	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensani
You wouldn’t want to do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munawaqchu.
I just know it’s a bad time	Chaylla yachani mana allin tiempo kasqanmanta
He was very much with her.	Payqa anchatan paywan kasharqan.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
I couldn’t be that person anymore	Manañam chay runa kayta atirqanichu
He was happy and happy.	Payqa kusisqa kusisqa kasqa.
I didn’t see that coming	Manam rikurqanichu chay hamunanta
I didn’t want to	Manam munarqanichu
Pretty much everything is true.	Yaqapaschá tukuy imapas chiqap kanman.
It may not be a good idea.	Manapaschá allinchu kanman.
I know where he lives	Yachanim maypi yachasqanmanta
One good, three bad.	Huk allin, kimsa mana allin.
I used to do it all the time	Ñawpaqtaqa sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwaq kani
That seemed to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
I was so nervous and exhausted.	Ancha mancharisqa, sayk’usqa ima karqani.
But it’s beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi.
I know you don't want to do this	Yachanim kayta ruwayta mana munasqaykita
I didn't care if it was	Manam imananpaschu karqa sichus chayna kasqanmantaqa
It’s just not good enough.	Chaylla mana allinchu.
Here's one.	Kaypi huk.
It’s like new.	Musuq hinam.
No, it certainly is.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
She would have been wonderful	Payqa ancha sumaqmi kanman karqa
Very very strong.	Ancha ancha sinchi.
Almost, but not quite.	Yaqa, ichaqa mana allintachu.
That’s what he wants.	Chaytan payqa munan.
But there was always something.	Ichaqa sapa kutim imapas karqa.
Something.	Imapas.
I think there’s something else involved	Yuyaykuni huk imapas chaypi kasqanmanta
I wasn’t sure about that	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu karqani
I wanted to know everything about it	Chaymanta tukuy imata yachayta munarqani
I have done this successfully.	Kaytaqa allintam ruwarqani.
This is as it should be.	Kayqa imayna kanan hinam.
I thought that was really interesting	Chayqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani
Not this, not that.	Mana kay, mana chay.
Not sure what to do about it.	Mana segurochu chaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
This meant money.	Kayqa qullqita niyta munarqa.
I don’t want to be anything.	Manam imapas kayta munanichu.
I didn’t want to have to do this	Manam munarqanichu kayta ruwanay kasqanmanta
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu.
Great beauty here.	Hatun sumaq kaypi.
I thought about it all along	Chaytaqa tukuy tiempon yuyaykurqani
He keeps saying all this everything is great.	Payqa hinallam nin tukuy kay tukuy ima hatun kasqanmanta.
I hope you will	Suyachkani chaynata ruwanaykipaq
I know what kind of person you are	Yachanim imayna runa kasqaykita
But that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi.
Obviously I did something wrong.	Sut’inmi imapas mana allin ruwasqayta.
I can’t do anything about anything	Manam imamantapas imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
I knew what was going on	Yacharqanim imakuna pasasqanmanta
I couldn’t speak anymore	Manañam rimayta atirqanichu
I’m really a guy.	Cheqaqtapunin kani.
I want to do well here	Kaypiqa allintam ruwayta munani
I didn’t want to talk about it	Manam chaymantaqa rimayta munarqanichu
He probably said it was.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayna kasqanmanta nirqa.
I thought that was really interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Some of this stuff is really, really good.	Wakin kay imakuna chiqap, chiqap allin.
I thought something might be wrong.	Yuyarqanim imapas mana allinchu kanman nispa.
I can’t tell you everything	Manam tukuy imatapas willayta atiymanchu
That he couldn’t do it.	Mana ruwayta atisqanmanta.
He is happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan.
I know it is important	Yachanim ancha allin kasqanmanta
I didn’t really know why he was coming	Manam chiqaptaqa yacharqanichu imanasqa hamunanta
I still think this is true.	Kunankamapas kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
Now it will be fine.	Kunanqa allinmi kanqa.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.	Manañam chaymanta rimayta munanichu.
It doesn’t mean he didn’t.	Manam niyta munanchu mana ruwasqanmanta.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
He does this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwan.
I mean this is what I mean.	Kayta niyta munani.
How very much.	Imayna ancha.
I don't think that will happen	Manam chayna pasananta piensanichu
It just looks so nice.	Chaylla ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
That afternoon.	Chay tarde.
He was never like that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqan.
I think that is true.	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
I just wasn’t sure what was going to happen	Chaylla mana segurochu karqani imachus kananmanta
It almost seems that way.	Yaqapaschá chayna rikchakun.
Do the right thing.	Chayta ruway.
I like it better	Aswan allintam gustan
I know this is true of me.	Yachanim kayqa ñuqamanta chiqap kasqanmanta.
I think it is better.	Aswan allin kasqanmantam piensani.
I can’t help it though	Manam yanapayta atinichu ichaqa
Maybe I was.	Ichapas karqani.
You’re more beautiful.	Aswan sumaqmi kanki.
I'm sure things will work out	Seguro kani imapas allin kananmanta
But no, it’s nice.	Ichaqa manan, sumaqmi.
They are indeed.	Cheqaqtapunin kanku.
I can’t do it.	Manam atiymanchu.
The process is very interesting.	Chay ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I didn’t want to play anymore	Manañam pukllayta munarqanichu
But this was worse.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
But he could not speak.	Ichaqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
I had a good day	Allin punchawmi karqani
I was sure of it.	Seguro karqani.
I’m fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kani.
But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.
I can't believe he would do this	Manam creeyta atinichu kayta ruwananta
Which is the biggest.	Imataq aswan hatun.
I think he’s done well	Yuyaykuni allinta ruwasqanmanta
I don’t like him.	Payqa manan gustawanchu.
All, all, all.	Tukuy, tukuy, tukuy.
If you want to.	Sichus munanki chayqa.
I don’t know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa.
That really could have been something.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin imapas kanman karqan.
I didn’t really think about it at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan allintachu chaypi yuyaykurqani
I didn’t know how to help	Manam yacharqanichu imayna yanapayta
I didn’t know what happened	Manam yacharqanichu ima pasasqanmanta
Something could be wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman.
I hope nothing is wrong	Suyachkani mana imapas mana allinchu kasqanmanta
It's not nearly as good anymore.	Manañam yaqa chayna allinchu.
I didn’t know what to do.	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
I wasn’t like that at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu karqani
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
I couldn't be sure it would do the job	Manam seguro kayta atirqanichu chay llamkayta ruwananmanta
I knew it wasn't	Yacharqanim mana chayna kasqanmanta
It’s a very good one.	Ancha allinmi.
I still think it is	Kunankamapas chayna kasqanmantam piensani
I'll be fine.	Allinmi kasaq.
I am very worried about something	Imamantapas anchatam llakikuni
I am very, very sorry.	Anchatam, anchatam llakikuni.
You can’t buy it.	Manam rantiyta atiwaqchu.
I know he’s tired	Yachanim sayk’usqa kasqanmanta
What’s the right thing to do.	Imataq allin kachkan.
But he couldn't say anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas niyta atirqanchu.
He looked unhappy.	Payqa mana kusisqachu rikchakurqa.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
No, that wasn’t a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
He’s not yet.	Payqa manaraqmi.
Yes, it is.	Arí, chayna.
He should be but where is he.	Payqa kanan ichaqa maypitaq kachkan.
I was pretty sure of that.	Chaymantaqa allintam seguro karqani.
Yeah, it’s that good.	Arí, chayna allinmi.
That lasted about three days.	Chayqa yaqa kimsa punchawmi karqa.
He knew it would happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayna kananta.
Maybe it’s here.	Ichapas kaypi kachkan.
Not so sure.	Mana chayna segurochu.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
He is nothing like that.	Payqa manan imapas chay hinachu.
I thought it was pretty cool	Ñuqaqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani
I did everything right	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwarqani
I thought everything was that fast	Yuyarqanim tukuy imapas chay utqaylla kasqanmanta
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
I really wanted to talk	Anchatam rimayta munarqani
That’s what it is.	Chayqa ima.
He was right about it.	Payqa chiqaptam nirqa.
I can’t tell you	Manam willayta atiymanchu
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
That would have been a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi kanman karqa.
I was extremely tired and exhausted	Sinchi sayk’usqa, sayk’usqa ima karqani
I have to do that wrong	Chaytaqa mana allintachu ruwanay tiyan
I didn’t see anything	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu
Great.	Hatun.
I am not sure of anything here	Kaypiqa manam imamantapas segurochu kani
I know he can.	Yachanim atisqanmanta.
I knew what he was doing.	Yacharqanim ima ruwasqanmanta.
I can't believe that	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atiymanchu
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
It’s probably not going to be a good thing.	Manachá allinchu kanqa.
One, two, three.	Huk, iskay, kimsa.
I can’t play anymore	Manañam pukllayta atinichu
I don’t know if that’s the case.	Manam yachanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
Make it better.	Aswan allinta ruway.
Such a sad ?.	Chayna llakisqa ?.
That’s almost .	Chayqa yaqa .
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
Everything seems fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakun.
I will certainly do it.	Chiqaptam ruwasaq.
In the past, this was not the case.	Ñawpaq tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I didn’t want it to be human	Manam munarqanichu runa kananta
I wonder if he knows	Yachanchu icha manachu chayta tapukuni
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinmi.
I think that's a great thing	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensani
He is the time.	Payqa tiempon.
The action is very important.	Ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
I thought it might be with you	Yuyarqanim qamwan kanman nispa
It would be obvious.	Sut’inmi kanman.
If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t work.	Sichus mana allintachu ruwan chayqa, mana allintachu ruwan.
He knew he would.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwananta.
It’s like today.	Kunan hinam.
I couldn’t have done it	Manam atiymanchu karqa
Very very much so.	Ancha ancha chayna.
He says he's sure.	Payqa segurom nin.
I’m glad he did.	Kusikuni chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Not sure what's wrong.	Mana segurochu ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
He’s probably the one.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayna.
I really want to be just that	Anchatan munani chaylla kayta
I never really thought about that	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas allintachu yuyaykurqani
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I thought it would be uncomfortable	Yuyarqanim mana allinchu kanman nispa
I can’t afford a car yet	Manaraqmi carrota rantiyta atiymanchu
I’m afraid it’s going to be bad.	Manchakuni mana allin kananta.
I knew this was true	Yacharqanim kayqa chiqap kasqanmanta
You want the wrong thing.	Mana allintam munanki.
Maybe it would be good.	Ichapas allin kanman.
You’re not feeling well.	Manam allinchu kachkanki.
I don’t know how, not yet	Manam yachanichu imayna, manaraqmi
I pretty much know what that is.	Yaqapaschá yachani imachus chay kasqanmanta.
He was really hurting.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin k’irisqa kasharqan.
A good one, but that’s all	Allin kaq, ichaqa chaylla
I’m afraid of what’s going to happen	Manchakuni imakuna pasananta
What is that.	Imataq chay.
But no one knows anything.	Ichaqa manan pipas imatapas yachanchu.
It shouldn’t be like this, but it is.	Manan kay hinachu kanan, ichaqa chay hinan.
I knew it was great	Yacharqanim hatun kasqanmanta
That looks nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi rikchakun.
I couldn't say why	Manam niyta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
It was actually really good.	Chiqaptaqa chiqap allinmi karqa.
Maybe more than that sometimes.	Ichapas chaymanta aswan wakin kuti.
How does that look like.	Imaynataq chay rikchakun.
He wanted to do that.	Payqa chayta ruwayta munarqan.
I thought that was really interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I know what you want to do	Yachanim ima ruway munasqaykita
I know what he likes	Yachanim ima gustasqanmanta
Three years.	Kimsa wata.
I knew it was going to happen	Yacharqanim chayna kananta
I didn’t think about anything	Manam imapipas piensarqanichu
To be good again.	Hukmanta allin kananpaq.
I couldn’t tell.	Manam willayta atirqanichu.
The man is a man.	Runa runa.
He was like that.	Payqa hinam karqa.
Everything went away.	Tukuy imapas rirqa.
Not a smoking man.	Mana pitaq runa.
He wanted to go with me, he said.	Payqa munarqa ñuqawan riyta, nispa.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
Maybe there are three.	Ichapas kimsa kanman.
I didn’t want to.	Manam munarqanichu.
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
But it looks good.	Ichaqa allinmi rikchakun.
Very good, actually.	Ancha allinmi, chiqaptaqa.
I don't think it's right or wrong.	Manam allinchu nitaq mana allinchu kasqanmantaqa manam piensanichu.
I knew it was true	Yacharqanim chiqap kasqanmanta
I wonder how it is	Imayna kasqanmantam tapukuni
Okay, actually.	Allinmi, chiqaptaqa.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
A great guy.	Huk hatun runa.
Faster, actually.	Aswan utqaylla, chiqaptaqa.
He was in the city.	Payqa llaqtapi kasqa.
He never really gets to talk to her though.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptapuni paywan rimayta atinchu ichaqa.
I want to know how that is	Imayna chay kasqanmanta yachayta munani
I didn’t want anyone else to be there	Manam munarqanichu huk runa chaypi kananta
I wasn’t happy.	Manam kusisqachu karqani.
I don’t know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa.
This was every day.	Kayqa sapa punchawmi karqa.
I really wanted to talk to him.	Anchatam paywan rimayta munarqani.
That’s what he wants.	Chaytan payqa munan.
No one could say for sure.	Manan pipas seguro niyta atirqanchu.
I didn’t mean that	Manam chaytaqa niyta munarqanichu
I didn't think he wanted to talk about it	Manam piensarqanichu chaymanta rimayta munasqanmanta
He didn't know what to make of this.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu kaymanta imata ruwananta.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I mean, it’s not.	Niyta munani, manam.
I didn’t plan on doing that now	Kunanqa manan chayta ruwayta yuyaykurqanichu
He certainly does.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
But it doesn’t matter	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu
I can’t do anything about it.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
Are you happy now?.	¿Kunanqa kusisqachu kanki?.
All day and night.	Tukuy punchaw tuta.
I really couldn’t say	Chiqaptaqa manam niyta atirqanichu
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Another interesting thing.	Huk sumaq imapas.
I didn’t know what was going to happen	Manam yacharqanichu imakuna pasananta
I always wonder where things went wrong	Sapa kutim tapukuni maypi imapas mana allin kasqanmanta
I know I can’t.	Yachanim mana atisqayta.
Like really bad.	Chiqap mana allin hina.
But that’s a nice thing.	Ichaqa chayqa sumaqmi.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
Is there such a thing?.	¿Kanchu chayna kaq?.
I hope it doesn’t	Suyachkani mana chayna kananta
And it was supposed to be.	Hinan kanan karqan.
She looked so nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
He can’t do that.	Mana chayta ruwayta atinchu.
I know it will go well	Yachanim allinta pasananta
I know it's wrong.	Yachanim mana allin kasqanmanta.
Now he can't.	Kunanqa manam atinchu.
The strong thing.	Sinchi kaq.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
I didn’t want to believe it.	Manam creeyta munarqanichu.
You’ll do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanki.
That's a lot of it.	Chayqa achkatam chaypi kachkan.
I am very sorry about that	Chaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni
Okay, that’s a good thing.	Allinmi, chayqa allinmi.
I would be good all the time	Tukuy tiempo allinmi kayman
I know what you want	Yachanim ima munasqaykita
But I couldn’t do anything about it	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu
I knew it was there	Yacharqanim chaypi kasqanmanta
I want to be here	Kaypi kayta munani
I couldn’t speak	Manam rimayta atirqanichu
Glad he's gone.	Kusisqam payqa manaña kasqanmanta.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kasqanmantaqa.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
I never knew he would be like that.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna runa kananta.
I'd be fine	Allinmi kayman
I didn’t know what he meant	Manam yacharqanichu ima niyta munasqanmanta
I can’t do anything about it	Manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
Such a good thing.	Chayna allin kaq.
I always thought this was bigger	Sapa kutim piensarqani kayqa aswan hatun kasqanmanta
You're right.	Qamqa chiqaptam.
I was a good guy.	Allin runam karqani.
But where is it?.	Ichaqa, ¿maypitaq kachkan?.
This thing is good.	Kay imapas allinmi.
He wants to know everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yachayta munan.
I’ve never seen that before	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu
He wasn’t alone in it.	Payqa manan sapallanchu chaypi kasharqan.
I still wasn’t sure what the truth was.	Manaraqmi segurochu karqani ima chiqap kasqanmantaqa.
A strong one.	Huk sinchi kaq.
I didn't do much more than that	Manam chaymantaqa aswan achkatam ruwarqani
It didn’t matter anymore	Manañam imananpaschu karqa
But you can’t talk.	Ichaqa manan rimayta atiwaqchu.
I doubt it very much	Anchatam iskayrayani
I can't speak now	Kunanqa manam rimayta atinichu
He is a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi.
I didn’t know anything	Manam imatapas yacharqanichu
I want to tell you everything	Tukuy imatam willayta munani
I’m pretty sure of that	Yaqapaschá chaymantaqa seguro kani
Another reality.	Huk chiqap kaq.
He is a human being.	Payqa runam.
That’s obviously not the case.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
That he didn’t have to do that.	Mana chayta ruwanan kasqanmanta.
Do what you want to do.	Munasqaykita ruway.
He knows it.	Payqa yachanmi.
Anything but what he had to do.	Imapas ichaqa ima ruwanan kasqanmanta.
I really want to do that.	Anchatan munani chayta ruwayta.
I hope it’s a good night	Suyachkani allin tuta kananta
I think that’s great	Chayqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensani
I know this must be hard for you	Yachanim kayqa qampaq sinchi kanan kasqanmanta
There is no other way to do it.	Manan huk ruwayqa kanchu.
This process didn’t really do it.	Kay ruwayqa manan cheqaqtachu ruwarqan.
I would like this to happen	Munaymanmi kay pasananta
I think they were scared	Yuyaykuni mancharisqa kasqankuta
I couldn’t do it.	Manam atirqanichu.
I don’t want to say it, but he’s a great guy.	Manam niyta munanichu, ichaqa hatun runam.
But I hadn’t thought of that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu.
I know what will happen	Yachanim imakuna pasananta
I know you can't help it	Yachanim mana yanapayta atisqaykita
You can’t help it.	Mana yanapayta atiwaqchu.
But there was nothing he could do.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
That was always the case.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqa.
It might be there.	Yaqapaschá chaypi kanman.
I knew what was coming	Yacharqanim imakuna hamunanta
I knew what that was like	Yacharqanim chay imayna kasqanmanta
Low.	Pisi.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa.
But it’s not quite right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu.
I had to do it fast.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwanay karqan.
Maybe I want to help	Ichapas yanapayta munani
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
I couldn’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu.
Obviously, he’s not.	Sut’inmi, payqa manan chay hinachu.
It wasn't that easy.	Manam chayna facilchu karqa.
I haven’t been like that in a long time.	Unayñan mana chay hinachu kani.
He was very angry.	Payqa sinchi phiñasqa kasharqan.
I had no idea what was wrong	Manam yuyaykurqanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I am fine.	Allinmi kachkani.
He always wanted to know more.	Payqa sapa kutim astawan yachayta munarqa.
Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi.
Another person, someone.	Huk runa, pitapas.
It's like a process.	Chayqa huk ruway hinam.
What he’s done.	Ima ruwasqanmanta.
He had to be alone.	Payqa sapallanmi kanan karqa.
I didn’t want it or want it	Manam munarqanichu nitaq munarqanichu
I'm hoping this is bad	Kaytaqa mana allintam suyachkani
He couldn’t have been more helpful.	Payqa manan aswan yanapayta atinmanchu karqan.
But do it right.	Ichaqa allinta ruway.
I can't believe he's gone	Manam creeyta atinichu manaña kasqanmanta
It didn't look like much.	Manam anchatachu rikchakurqa.
I wonder if he’s alone.	Sapallanchu kasqanmanta tapukuni.
He did so, but without success.	Chaytan ruwarqan, ichaqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
I don't care where it is.	Manam maypi kasqanmantaqa imananpaschu.
Who could have spoken.	Pitaq rimayta atinman karqan.
Bad.	Mana allin.
The first two things.	Ñawpaq kaq iskay imakuna.
I wanted to tell you something	Imatapas willayta munarqani
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
I almost certainly did	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqani
Maybe it was the real thing.	Ichapas chiqap kaq karqa.
He is a wonderful man.	Payqa huk sumaq runam.
There is no such thing as.	Manam kanchu nispa.
It won’t be easy.	Manan facilchu kanqa.
They are the ones.	Paykunaqa kanku.
But it wasn’t that bad.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu mana allinchu karqan.
But he could never do that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
. . . .	.
He’s alone.	Sapallanmi.
Something really.	Imapas chiqap.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I like it better.	Aswan allintam gustan.
He doesn’t care anymore.	Payqa manañan imananpaschu.
But things were good.	Ichaqa imapas allinmi karqa.
Otherwise, it’s not.	Mana chayqa, manan.
You’re not sure.	Manam segurochu kanki.
That’s going to be a lot harder.	Chayqa aswan sasa kanqa.
I knew you were unhappy	Yacharqanim mana kusisqa kasqaykita
A little scared that he shouldn't be.	Huk chikan mancharisqa mana kananmanta.
I still couldn’t figure out why.	Manaraqmi yachayta atirqanichu imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
I can’t be this person	Manam kay runa kayta atiymanchu
You can’t be sure.	Manan seguro kayta atiwaqchu.
This shouldn’t be the case.	Kayqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
In fact, he probably did.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqa.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
I couldn’t be here anymore	Manañam kaypi kayta atirqanichu
Do the job of the job.	Chay llamkayta ruway.
This is not a good thing	Kayqa manam allinchu
He didn’t know how to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta yacharqanchu.
I didn’t know about it	Manam chaymantaqa yacharqanichu
I want to be right	Allinmi kayta munani
That has always been the case.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
From what he knows.	Yachasqanmanta.
Alright.	Allinmi.
I can't help it now	Kunanqa manam yanapayta atiymanchu
I think you’ll be happy	Yuyaykuni kusisqa kanki
I didn’t want to help	Manam yanapayta munarqanichu
If he had been.	Sichus payqa karqan chayqa.
No.	Manam.
I knew what he could do	Yacharqanim ima ruway atisqanmanta
I didn't think it was that bad	Manam piensarqanichu chayna mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I never thought it would happen	Manam haykapipas chayna kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu
That’s what he wanted.	Chaytan payqa munarqan.
Maybe it was the case.	Ichapas chayna karqa.
It wouldn’t be a good thing.	Mana allinchu kanman.
Please, please.	Ama hina kaspa, ama hina kaspa.
But first, a little background.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa, huk chikan ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
Everything seems fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakun.
Something was very wrong.	Imapas ancha mana allinmi karqa.
Now I like this guy	Kunanqa kay runam gustan
But it won’t be good.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanqa.
I really want to help	Anchatam yanapayta munani
Something no one can really predict.	Imapas mana pipas chiqaptapuni willayta atinchu.
I just didn’t want to talk about it	Chaylla mana chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu
I know that it is not	Yachanim mana chayna kasqanmanta
I really didn’t want to go	Chiqaptaqa manam riyta munarqanichu
He had to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanan karqan.
But there is no one	Ichaqa manan pipas kanchu
I know exactly what it is like	Allintam yachani imayna kasqanmanta
Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi.
I think that is something else	Chayqa huk imapas kasqanmantam piensani
What is the probability?.	¿Imataq kanman?.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munanichu.
It shouldn’t be that way.	Manan chay hinachu kanan.
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
I did it right.	Allintam ruwarqani.
I’m that good at it.	Ñuqaqa chayna allinmi kani.
Now I know this will never work	Kunanqa yachanim kayqa mana haykapipas allinta ruwananta
I couldn’t say anything	Manam imatapas niyta atirqanichu
I think that's what it is	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani
I couldn’t say anything	Manam imatapas niyta atirqanichu
But this is worse.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan mana allinmi.
He said yes to it.	Payqa arí nisqa.
It really wasn't that bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna mana allinchu karqa.
Yes, he is right.	Arí, payqa allintam nin.
He is happier than ever.	Payqa aswan kusisqa kachkan.
They were both of them.	Iskayninkum karqa.
I want to know what’s wrong with him	Paywan ima mana allin kasqanmanta yachayta munani
I haven’t been this happy in a long time	Unayñan mana kay hina kusisqachu kani
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
I’m not sure about that.	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu kani.
Now he wasn't so sure.	Kunanmi ichaqa mana chayna segurochu karqa.
I am not sure why	Manam segurochu kani imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
I want to know more about it	Chaymanta astawan yachayta munani
You’re not here to stay.	Manam kaypichu kachkanki.
I think it would be a great, great thing.	Yuyaykuni hatun, hatun ruway kanman.
That won’t do any good.	Chayqa manan imapipas allintachu ruwanqa.
I know what it’s like.	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
I want it like nothing else	Mana imapas hinam munani
But he knows that is no longer the case.	Ichaqa yachanmi manaña chayna kasqanmantaqa.
This is worse than anything.	Kayqa imamantapas aswan mana allinmi.
I need to do this, to do it on a regular basis	Kayta ruwanay tiyan, sapa kuti ruwanaypaq
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
It’s been around for a long time.	Unayñan kashan.
I didn’t know that before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
The best part of it.	Aswan allin kaq.
I didn’t think much of it at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan anchatachu yuyaykurqani
But nothing was this bad.	Ichaqa manan imapas kay hina mana allinchu karqan.
Things were very wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas ancha mana allinmi karqa.
No, he wasn’t really.	Manan, manan cheqaqtachu payqa karqan.
I thought nothing of it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu.
I certainly didn’t want to.	Cheqaqtapunin mana munarqanichu.
You probably already knew that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa yacharqanki.
I know what happened	Yachanim imapas pasasqanmanta
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
Very, very tired.	Ancha, ancha sayk’usqa.
How do you do this.	Imaynatataq kayta ruwanki.
He's doing better, you know.	Payqa aswan allintam ruwachkan, yachanki.
No, that’s a good thing.	Manan, chayqa allinmi.
I know you will do this	Yachanim kayta ruwanaykita
I think he’s really hurt	Yuyaykuni chiqaptapuni k’irisqa kasqanmanta
No, not probably.	Manan, manan ichapas.
I think it would be good	Allinmi kanman nispaymi
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I knew something good would happen	Yacharqanim imapas allin pasananta
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.
Maybe you’ll do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanki.
I know what that is like	Yachanim chay imayna kasqanmanta
Yes, yes, yes.	Arí, arí, arí.
I didn’t mean, you know, like that	Manam niyta munarqanichu, yachanki, chaynata
I knew it was going to happen	Yacharqanim chayna kananta
Perhaps he does.	Yaqapaschá payqa chayta ruwan.
I think he was worried about me	Yuyaykuni ñuqamanta llakisqa kasqanmanta
I can't believe it happens so fast, but it's wonderful.	Manam creeyta atiymanchu chayna utqaylla pasananta, ichaqa ancha sumaqmi.
That he was so lonely.	Chayna sapallan kasqanmanta.
I hope to go there one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw chayman riyta.
To be unrealistic.	Mana chiqap kananpaq.
Now? 	Kunan?
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
You have to make a play here.	Kaypiqa huk pukllayta ruwanayki tiyan.
There is a third person involved.	Kimsa kaq runam chaypi kachkan.
I don't think he really knows.	Manam piensanichu chiqaptapuni yachan.
The bad thing is.	Mana allin kaq.
But you need to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanayki.
I couldn’t have done it	Manam ruwayta atiymanchu karqa
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
But he is .	Ichaqa payqa .
I mean like a human being	Runa hinam niyta munani
I barely saw anything	Yaqapaschá imatapas rikurqanichu
I just couldn’t do it	Chaylla mana ruwayta atirqanichu
I can't work for you	Manam qampaq llamkayta atiymanchu
But that was never the case.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqan.
I don’t really know what’s going to happen.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imakuna kananta.
I think he didn’t want to talk anymore	Yuyaykuni manaña rimayta munasqanmanta
I still think it is.	Hinallam piensani chayna kasqanmanta.
I think, perhaps, it should be too much	Yuyaykuni, ichapas, llumpay kanan
I want to say one more person.	Huk runa astawan niyta munani.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
I want to know what that is	Imataq chay kasqanmanta yachayta munani
I knew there was a though	Yacharqanim huk ichaqa kasqanmanta
If you want to.	Munaspaqa.
I never saw him want anything like that.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu chaynata imatapas munasqanmanta.
But it couldn’t have been better.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu kanman karqan.
I mean after all, it could always be worse	Niyta munani tukuy imamanta, sapa kuti aswan mana allin kanman
Great guy.	Hatun runa.
That doesn’t matter now.	Chayqa manan kunanqa imananpaschu.
No, please don’t.	Manan, ama hina kaspa.
No one wants that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas munanchu.
You have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki.
A cup of coffee is fine	Huk kukata allinmi
I didn’t want to know more.	Manam astawan yachayta munarqanichu.
It still doesn’t matter.	Kunankamapas manam imananpaschu.
I don’t like that at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas gustanchu.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
Tell him where it will be.	Willay maypi kananta.
I know what it’s like	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta
You are no longer safe.	Qamqa manañam allinchu kachkanki.
This was the case.	Kayqa karqan.
He took it seriously.	Chaytaqa allintan qhawarirqan.
Now, he couldn't do anything about that.	Kunanqa, manan chaytaqa imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
I couldn't tell you this	Kaytaqa manam willayta atirqanichu
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
No one knows what’s going to happen.	Manan pipas yachanchu imachus pasananta.
I know he is lonely	Yachanim sapallan kasqanmanta
It wouldn’t be right.	Manan allinchu kanman.
I think that’s a good thing	Chayqa allinmi nispan yuyaykuni
I couldn’t tell.	Manam willayta atirqanichu.
If there was ever a time.	Sichus hayk’aqllapas huk tiempo karqan chayqa.
I didn't want to play this game anymore	Manañam kay pukllayta pukllayta munarqanichu
It shouldn’t be that way.	Manan chay hinachu kanan.
But it looks good.	Ichaqa allinmi rikchakun.
I did that last year	Chaytaqa qayna wata ruwarqani
I want to go tomorrow	Paqarin riyta munani
He was a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam karqa.
I didn’t want to play again	Manam hukmanta pukllayta munarqanichu
But no one knows what will happen.	Ichaqa manan pipas yachanchu imachus kananta.
I want to know what happened.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta munani.
I can’t say where.	Manam niyta atiymanchu maypi.
I wasn’t really sure	Manam chiqaptachu seguro karqani
Anything else.	Imamantapas.
No one is here long.	Manam pipas unaytachu kaypi kachkan.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Not yet actually	Manaraqmi chiqaptaqa
Do it every day.	Sapa punchaw ruway.
He meant it though.	Payqa ichaqa chaytan niyta munarqan.
You’re the one, you’re not.	Qamqa kanki, manam.
I know you do that.	Yachanim chayta ruwasqaykita.
Yes, you know right.	Arí, allintam yachanki.
All day today, no.	Tukuy punchaw kunan punchaw, manam.
Does anyone know how to do this?.	¿Pipas yachanchu kayta ruwananpaq?.
I was going to do it this afternoon	Kunan tarde ruwanaypaqmi karqani
It was a bad time.	Chayqa mana allin tiempon karqan.
I can’t speak anymore	Manañam rimayta atinichu
That’s always the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim.
I still don't know how he did it.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imayna ruwasqanmanta.
I can never play safe from it	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa allinta pukllayta atiymanchu
Decade.	Chunka wata.
And he did it.	Hinan payqa ruwarqan.
Yes, that’s a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I wasn’t sure if it was right or wrong	Manam segurochu karqani allinchu icha mana allin kasqanmantaqa
Maybe it would have been.	Ichapas chayna kanman karqa.
He can’t believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atinchu.
Maybe it’s true.	Ichapas chiqap kanman.
That’s what you want.	Chaytan munanki.
I just made a new cup of coffee	Chayraqmi huk musuq kukata ruwarqani
Otherwise I wouldn’t do it	Mana chayqa manan ruwaymanchu
I am truly sorry for what happened	Cheqaqtapunin llakikuni imachus pasasqanmanta
I didn't know it was that bad.	Chayna mana allin kasqanmantaqa manam yacharqanichu.
To be no more.	Manaña kananpaq.
There is no.	Kanchu.
As a married couple.	Huk casarasqa hina.
Do your best to do it.	Tukuy atisqaykita ruway.
That’s the kind of thing.	Chayna kaq.
I hope you do well	Suyachkani allinta ruwanaykipaq
But it wasn’t the best.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu karqan.
That day was not like today.	Chay punchawqa manam kunan punchaw hinachu karqa.
It couldn’t have been better.	Manan aswan allinchu kanman karqan.
He wants it, he wants it.	Payqa munan, munan.
The largest one.	Aswan hatun kaq.
Next week.	Hamuq semana.

It’s not easy.	Manam facilchu.
You really can’t beat it.	Chiqaptaqa manam atipayta atiwaqchu.

I didn’t know you were safe.	Manam yacharqanichu seguro kasqaykita.
Indeed, he did.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
Obviously not here.	Sut’inmi mana kaypichu.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kasqanmantaqa.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
If so, that’s fine.	Sichus chayna kanman chayqa, allinmi.
I did, if you will.	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani, munaspaqa.
There is no one.	Manam pipas kanchu.
He wanted to know.	Payqa yachayta munarqa.
I can't say how many.	Manam niyta atiymanchu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
I’ve done this.	Kaytaqa ruwarqani.
I knew it was going to happen	Yacharqanim chayna kananta
But I couldn’t do that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
A little bit sure.	Huk chikan seguro.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
One person was injured	Huk runam k’irisqa karqan
I did that all the time	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwaq kani
I just couldn’t believe he did this	Chaylla mana creeyta atirqanichu kayta ruwasqanmanta
If not, it’s fine.	Mana chayqa, allinmi.
Not like a human being.	Mana runa hinachu.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
I really was, but it looked good.	Ñuqaqa chiqaptam karqani, ichaqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
I couldn’t talk about it	Manam chaymantaqa rimayta atirqanichu
I didn’t want to talk to him anymore	Manañam paywan rimayta munarqanichu
I know it very well	Ñuqaqa ancha allintam yachani
I was okay with it.	Allinmi karqani.
I wish it had been harder	Aswan sasa kanman karqan chayqa, allinmi kanman karqan
Back then you never knew what was going to happen.	Chay tiempopiqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqankichu imachus pasananta.
I don’t know exactly	Manam allintachu yachani
But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.
What would it have been like.	¿Imaynataq kanman karqa.
That’s what it means.	Chayqa niyta munan.
But it was good.	Ichaqa allinmi kasqa.
I can’t say that, not yet	Manam chaytaqa niyta atiymanchu, manaraqmi
At the time, he couldn’t.	Chay tiempopiqa manan atirqanchu.
You have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki.
I didn’t know it existed	Manam yacharqanichu chay kasqanmantaqa
I couldn't see why.	Manam rikurqanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa.
He seemed to be like that.	Payqa chayman rikchakurqa.
But this is best not for long.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan allinmi mana unaytachu.
To be there for you.	Chaypi kananpaq.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Ten weeks without you.	Chunka semana mana qanwan.
I thought that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani chayna kasqanmanta
Anything, please anything.	Imapas, ama hina kaspa imapas.
I knew there was more.	Yacharqanim aswan achka kasqanmanta.
I know this better now	Kaytaqa kunanmi aswan allinta yachani
Very nice guy.	Ancha sumaq runa.
I think that should be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanan nispan yuyaykuni.
Well! 	Allin!
I mean, there’s three of us.	Niyta munani, kimsa kayku.
He probably had no idea what was going to happen.	Payqa manachá imachus pasananta yuyaykurqanchu.
But he was sad and sad.	Ichaqa llakisqa llakisqa kasharqan.
I didn’t see where you did this	Manam rikurqanichu maypi kayta ruwasqaykita
Great performance tonight	Kunan tuta hatun ruway
Something was wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu karqa.
He probably did just that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqan.
Who knows what will come next.	Pitaq yachan imakuna chaymanta hamunanta.
You really are.	Chiqaptam kanki.
Even today.	Kunankamapas.
He wanted to go.	Payqa riyta munarqa.
One by one, one by one.	Hukmanta hukmanta.
But I was fine	Ichaqa allinmi karqani
I would never have done that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa.

This will continue to happen.	Kayqa hinallam kanqa.
He wasn’t up to it.	Payqa manan chayman hinachu karqan.

I know nothing about what is right	Manam imatapas yachanichu imapas allin kasqanmantaqa

I could not do this	Kaytaqa manam ruwayta atirqanichu
I really don't think so.	Chiqaptaqa manam piensanichu.
The third day of the month.	Kimsa kaq p’unchaw.
It’s not anymore.	Manañam.
You want to know what’s going on.	Imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta munanki.

It shouldn’t be that way.	Manan chay hinachu kanan.
He certainly said that.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta nirqan.

I still think about this every day.	Kunankamapas sapa punchawmi kaypi piensani.

You are pretty sure.	Qamqa allin segurom kanki.
Something was terribly wrong, but he didn’t know what it was.	Imapas sinchi mana allinchu kasqa, ichaqa manan yacharqanchu imachus kasqanmanta.

You can’t do it.	Qamqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.

That’s what you need to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki.

This was the worst.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
But he’s a good guy.	Ichaqa allin runa.

I can’t tell you.	Manam willayta atiymanchu.
But he is not happy.	Ichaqa manan kusisqachu kashan.
Yes, it is.	Arí, nispa.
But I will do it soon	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwasaq
Never, you think.	Ama hayk’aqpas, yuyaykunki.
He had to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
He could tell they were happy.	Payqa repararqanmi kusisqa kasqankuta.

I wish things weren't so safe	Munaymanmi imapas mana chayna seguro kananta
He's obviously upset.	Payqa sut'inmi llakisqa kashan.
Maybe he was better.	Ichapas payqa aswan allin karqa.
He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
I don't think it's there.	Manam chaypi kasqanmantaqa piensanichu.
Perhaps he was.	Ichapas payqa karqa.
Maybe everything will work out.	Ichapas tukuy imapas allin kanman.
If it ever does.	Sichus hayk’aqllapas chayta ruwan chayqa.
That’s what he does.	Chaytan payqa ruwan.
I knew nothing about it	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas yacharqanichu
I know something is wrong	Yachanim imapas mana allin kasqanmanta
I was okay with it	Allinmi karqani

Maybe one day it will.	Ichapas huk punchaw chayna kanman.
I am sad and depressed.	Llakisqa, llakisqa ima kachkani.
No one could do it.	Manan pipas atirqanchu.
But it could have been worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan.
I want it so much.	Anchatam munani.
I didn’t know you could do that	Manam yacharqanichu chayta ruwayta atisqaykita
They are still the same today.	Kunankamapas chayna kachkanku.
Yes, it was too good to be true.	Arí, ancha allinmi karqa chiqap kananpaq.
It should take a few days	Iskay kimsa punchawmi ruwanan
Yes, every time.	Arí, sapa kuti.
I am sure that is the case	Chayna kasqanmantam seguro kani
I didn’t know there were so many.	Manam yacharqanichu chayna achka kasqankuta.
I didn’t want to say anything	Manam imatapas niyta munarqanichu

Actually, that’s a good thing.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa allinmi.
He can't be here.	Payqa manam kaypi kayta atinmanchu.
I didn’t know what to do yet	Manaraqmi yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta
I thought that was really cool	Chayqa chiqap sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani
I don’t know exactly	Manam allintachu yachani
I would like this to happen.	Munaymanmi kay pasananta.
I knew he never would	Yacharqanim mana haykapipas ruwananta
A little bit of me	Huk chikan ñuqamanta

I was the first person, now	Ñawpaq kaq runam karqani, kunanqa
I wanted to go again, but I couldn't	Hukmanta riyta munarqani, ichaqa manam atirqanichu
I wonder why he is doing it	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayta ruwachkan nispa
I actually thought it was good	Chiqaptaqa allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
No, this was nice.	Manan, kayqa sumaqmi karqan.
Something bigger than me.	Imapas ñuqamanta aswan hatun kaq.
I know it's not true.	Yachanim mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
I can’t say anymore	Manañam niyta atiymanchu
He couldn’t do this.	Payqa manan kayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
I don't know exactly where it is.	Manam allintachu yachani maypi kasqanmantaqa.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
It was as good as ever.	Ñawpaq hina allinmi karqa.
First this, then that.	Ñawpaqtaqa kayta, chaymanta chayta.
I never knew, really	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu, chiqaptaqa
I probably won’t go that long	Manapaschá chay unaytachu risaq
He doesn’t know any better.	Payqa manan aswan allintachu yachan.
This is like it is.	Kayqa hinam.
I don’t want to do this.	Manam kayta ruwayta munanichu.
Don’t you think so?.	¿Manachu chayta yuyanki?.
But I’m so excited.	Ichaqa anchatam kusikuni.
I know how to play the game.	Pukllayta yachani.
I couldn’t help it, I didn’t want to help it	Manam yanapayta atirqanichu, manam yanapayta munarqanichu
I knew what he meant	Yacharqanim ima niyta munasqanmanta
Half a year.	Kuska wata.
I’ve been doing that for a long time.	Unayñan chaytaqa ruwarqani.
I can't believe that	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atiymanchu
She’s actually really nice.	Payqa chiqaptaqa chiqap sumaqmi.

I did everything right	Tukuy imatapas allintam ruwarqani
It’s a very good one.	Ancha allinmi.
I still couldn't speak	Kunankamapas manam rimayta atirqanichu
He is sad and depressed	Payqa llakisqa, llakisqa ima kachkan
No, indeed, it is.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin, chhayna.
I couldn't believe it was so fast	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chaylla kasqanmantaqa
I will continue to be here	Hinallam kaypi kasaq
For example.	Kay hina.
I didn’t know what to do	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta
It doesn’t have to be a bad thing.	Manan mana allinchu kanan.
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.
I can’t go there	Manam chayman riyta atiymanchu
Just, you were there.	Chaylla, chaypi karqanki.

You were a human being.	Huk runam karqanki.
I didn’t know about anything yet.	Manaraqmi imamantapas yacharqanichu.
He was eager to talk.	Payqa anchatam rimayta munarqa.
I want to be happy here with him	Paywan kaypi kusisqa kayta munani
Better not to have it.	Aswan allinmi mana kananpaq.
I thought it was too much	Llumpay llumpay kasqanmantam piensarqani
I didn’t think so	Manam chayna piensarqanichu
But he says it right.	Ichaqa allintam nin.
I don’t want to.	Manam munanichu.
Everything remains the same.	Tukuy imapas hinallam kachkan.
That was a good thing	Chayqa allinmi karqa
I couldn’t tell	Manam yachayta atirqanichu
He knows it will never happen.	Payqa yachanmi mana hayk’aqpas chayna kananta.
I knew no one would ever do it.	Yacharqanim mana pipas haykapipas ruwananta.
We’re together.	Kuska kanchik.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
A great one.	Huk hatun.
But nothing will work out.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu kanqa.
I would have been the same	Ñuqapas chayna kanman karqa
I said it was right	Allintam nirqani
It’s going to be really great.	Chiqaptam hatun kanqa.
Maybe that’s what it is	Ichapas chayna kasqanmanta
I am here almost every day	Yaqa sapa punchawmi kaypi kachkani
It certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
I want to play too.	Ñuqapas pukllayta munani.
He is a busy man.	Payqa ocupasqa runam.
I wasn’t too happy either	Ñuqapas manam ancha kusisqachu karqani
He wants to go.	Payqa riyta munan.
I think that's what this is	Chayqa kayqa kasqanmantam piensani
I hope there is nothing from this	Suyachkani kaymanta mana imapas kananpaq
I knew it wasn't going to be easy	Yacharqanim mana facilchu kananta
If only he could talk.	Sichus rimayta atinman karqan chayqa.
I think ahead tonight	Kunan tuta ñawpaqmantaraqmi yuyaykuni
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
I can’t believe it	Manam creeyta atinichu
I didn’t really want to be here	Manam anchatachu kaypi kayta munarqani
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
But that wasn’t really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chhayna karqan.
She was so beautiful at the time.	Payqa chay tiempopiqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I have to do this	Kayta ruwanay tiyan
That was probably not a good thing.	Chayqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu karqan.
He wanted to play alone.	Payqa sapallan pukllayta munarqan.
He couldn’t get over it.	Payqa manan chayta atipayta atirqanchu.
I just didn’t know what to say	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu ima niyta
It’s better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinmi.
The bad thing is.	Mana allin kaq.
This week here, that week there.	Kay semana kaypi, chay semana chaypi.
He wanted it very much.	Payqa anchatam munarqa.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
It was always both.	Sapa kutim iskayninku karqa.
I mean a lot of things.	Anchatam niyta munani.
I think they are real now.	Yuyaykuni kunanqa chiqap kasqankuta.
Someone had to be there.	Pipas chaypi kanan karqa.
I wasn’t very good at it	Manam ancha allinchu karqani
He wanted to talk now.	Payqa kunan rimayta munarqa.
But he knew he was there.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chaypi kashasqanmanta.
I didn’t know this existed	Manam yacharqanichu kayqa kasqanmanta
He could never do that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
I don’t know if you had to do that.	Mana yachanichu sichus chayta ruwanayki karqan chayta.
I didn’t want to be here	Manam kaypi kayta munarqanichu
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I didn’t know what it was	Manam yacharqanichu ima kasqanmanta
I didn’t want this to happen again	Manam munarqanichu hukmanta kay pasananta
But that’s what he wanted.	Ichaqa chaytan payqa munarqan.
I know what it’s like.	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta.
No, that wouldn’t be right.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
I can't get over this.	Kaytaqa manam atipayta atiymanchu.
Every night.	Sapa tuta.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
I didn’t want to believe this was real	Manam creeyta munarqanichu kayqa chiqap kasqanmantaqa
I couldn’t say any more.	Manam astawan rimayta atirqanichu.
There is no time for it.	Mana tiempon kanchu.
I want to do this right.	Kayta allinta ruwayta munani.
If anyone can help it would be great.	Sichus pipas yanapayta atinman chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
Then the third.	Chaymanta kimsa kaq.
There never is, not really.	Manam haykapipas kanchu, manam chiqaptaqa.
I wasn’t sure of anything anymore	Manañam imamantapas segurochu karqani
I thought that was really interesting.	Chaytaqa ancha sumaqmi nispaymi piensarqani.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
Anyone knows what happened.	Pipas yachanmi chayna kasqanmantaqa.
But how do I do this?.	Ichaqa, ¿imaynatataq kayta ruwasaq?.
No it isn’t like that.	Manan manan chay hinachu.
I think that was the worst part	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni
It looked very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
Being very good.	Ancha allin kay.
It could be worse.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman.
But it is not so sure.	Ichaqa manan chay hina segurochu.
He’s not sure he can.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan atisqanmanta.
It doesn’t always do that.	Manan sapa kutichu chayta ruwan.
He is such a good guy.	Payqa chayna allin runam.
You need to do this step.	Kay llamk’ayta ruwanayki tiyan.
Yes, he couldn’t.	Arí, manan atirqanchu.
I want her to be happy	Munani kusisqa kananta
Describe how great they are.	Willay imayna hatun kasqankuta.
This would rather be good.	Kayqa aswan allinmi kanman allin kay.
But maybe.	Ichaqa ichapas.
I know you are very happy	Yachanim ancha kusisqa kasqaykita
That was probably the case at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
He noticed it.	Payqa repararqanmi.
He doesn’t care, not anymore.	Payqa manan imananpaschu, manañan.
He doesn’t care, of course.	Payqa manan imananpaschu, sut’inmi.
I know it is important.	Yachanim ancha allin kasqanmanta.
I couldn't say how long	Manam niyta atirqanichu hayka unayta
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
I want to know everything	Tukuy imata yachayta munani
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
He knew how to do it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwayta.
I knew it wasn't	Yacharqanim mana chayna kasqanmanta
Everything seemed fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa.
Not good, great.	Mana allinchu, hatun.
He is the best.	Payqa aswan allinmi.
I haven’t seen it before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu
That’s what he wanted to do.	Chaytan payqa ruwayta munarqan.
Perhaps he asked her to do so.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwananpaq nirqan.
I know that he will	Yachanim chayna ruwananta
I didn’t think anything like that would happen	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayna imapas pasananta
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I never knew why	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta
You can’t be this.	Manam kayta atiwaqchu.
I certainly wouldn’t do that.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chayta ruwaymanchu.
I didn’t know what to do about it	Manam yacharqanichu chaymanta imata ruwanayta
He is such a great guy.	Payqa chayna hatun runam.
But he could never do that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
He knew why.	Payqa yacharqanmi imarayku chayta.
It shouldn’t be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan.
I can’t tell you that yet	Chaytaqa manaraqmi willayta atiymanchu
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
He figured out what to do.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi ima ruwananta.
That’s going to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanqa.
I can’t tell you.	Manam yachayta atinichu.
I’m not sure about anything	Manam imamantapas segurochu kani
I know that it is.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
Maybe a little, maybe a lot.	Ichapas huk chikan, ichapas achka.
It’s not good for anyone.	Mana pimanpas allinchu.
They are the best!!.	Paykunaqa aswan allin kanku!!.
He is doing a good job.	Payqa allintam ruwachkan.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
Don’t know what’s wrong.	Ama yachankichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I thought this would be good	Kayqa allinmi kanman nispaymi nirqani
I thought you were better than this	Kaymanta aswan allin kasqaykita yuyaykurqani
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I don't know.	Manam yachanichu.
I know you can't do that	Yachanim mana chayta ruwayta atisqaykita
Everything was as described.	Tukuy imapas nisqa hinam karqa.
I didn’t know what he meant.	Manam yacharqanichu imamanta rimayta munasqanmanta.
You have to do all of that.	Tukuy chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
I knew this was important	Yacharqanim kayqa ancha allin kasqanmanta
I wasn’t sure.	Manam segurochu karqani.
I know it's hard for you	Yachanim qampaq sasa kasqanmanta
I thought it was really great	Chiqap hatun kasqanmantam piensarqani
But he knows something.	Ichaqa imatapas yachanmi.
He was very frightened.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa kasqa.
It doesn’t exist now.	Manam kunanqa kanchu.
You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
Perhaps he was.	Ichapas payqa karqa.
You know, it was really hard.	Yachanki, chiqaptam sasa karqa.
I really don't care about that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
That wasn’t a good thing	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa
He certainly couldn’t do that here.	Cheqaqtapunin kaypi mana chayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
I didn't know there was more	Manam yacharqanichu aswan achka kasqanmanta
I wonder about it a lot	Anchatam chaymanta tapukuni
Everyone is here.	Lliwmi kaypi kachkanku.
I said okay and everything is fine.	Allinmi nispaymi nirqani tukuy imapas allinmi nispa.
I think you know exactly what this is.	Yuyaykuni allinta yachanki imachus kay kasqanmanta.
It’s actually not bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam mana allinchu.
Maybe that’s actually beauty.	Ichapas chayqa chiqaptaqa sumaq kay.
Twenty years ago, it was.	Iskay chunka wata ñawpaqtaqa, chayna karqa.
It was obvious I wanted to	Sut’inmi karqan munasqayta
More and more.	Astawan astawan.
I don't really worry about that.	Chaytaqa manam anchatachu llakikuni.
She was beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa.
He isn’t.	Payqa manam.
That’s what it does.	Chaytan ruwan.
But it really is.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin.
At first I didn’t know what to do	Ñawpaqtaqa manan yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta
I have to do it right	Allinta ruwanay tiyan
I was never quite right.	Manam haykapipas allintachu karqani.
He is rightly angry.	Payqa allintam phiñasqa kachkan.
It’s so beautiful.	Chayna sumaq.
It means something more.	Aswan imatapas niyta munan.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
I didn’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu.
But that may not be easy.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manapaschá facilchu kanman.
A first, that’s for sure	Huk ñawpaq, chayqa seguro
I hope he does well.	Suyachkani allinta ruwananta.
I wasn’t good at this	Manam kaypiqa allinchu karqani
I was like the sure thing.	Ñuqaqa seguro kaq hinam karqani.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
I was sure something was wrong	Seguro karqani imapas mana allin kananpaq
I didn’t want to be with him	Manam paywan kayta munarqanichu
A wonderful man, indeed	Huk sumaq runa, chiqaptapuni
Being good is not good.	Allin kayqa manam allinchu.
I couldn’t say or do anything.	Manam imatapas niyta nitaq ruwayta atirqanichu.
I actually like this one better.	Chiqaptaqa kayqa aswan allintam gustan.
Explain why.	Willay imanasqa chayta.
I didn’t do it right	Manam allintachu ruwarqani
I wasn’t good either	Ñuqapas mana allinchu karqani
He was the guy.	Payqa chay runam karqa.
I haven’t been able to do that yet	Manaraqmi chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I’m sorry about this.	Kaymanta llakikuni.
But one person doesn’t.	Ichaqa huk runam mana.
Yes, that is better.	Arí, chayqa aswan allinmi.
No, this wasn’t a good thing.	Manan, kayqa manan allinchu karqan.
I know you can do it.	Yachanim atisqaykita.
He knew it wouldn’t happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kananta.
I'm good.	Allinmi kani.
It's really quick.	Chiqaptam utqaylla.
I just can’t help it	Chaylla mana yanapayta atinichu
I'll do that.	Chaytaqa ruwasaq.
I couldn’t be with him anymore	Manañam paywan kayta atirqanichu
Yes, he can do that.	Arí, chaytan payqa ruwanman.
No one knows exactly what to do.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan ima ruwananta.
I know that's really bad.	Yachanim chayqa chiqap mana allin kasqanmanta.
That is not an easy task.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu.
You are truly alone	Chiqaptam sapallayki kachkanki
I can’t do it.	Manam ruwayta atiymanchu.
Not scared or anything.	Mana mancharisqa nitaq ima.
That’s not a bad thing	Chayqa manan mana allinchu
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
He thinks he needs to spend more time with you.	Payqa piensanmi qanwan astawan tiempota pasananta.
It always seems to be.	Sapa kutim yaqapaschá chayna.
I really want to know.	Anchatan munani yachayta.
That’s not going to be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
He did not go easy.	Payqa manam facilchu rirqa.
I think that's what it is	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani
You certainly know that.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa yachanki.
However, it is still not good enough.	Ichaqa, kunankamapas manam allinchu.
This is probably not a good thing.	Kayqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu.
Something was wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I wasn’t sure he would	Manam segurochu karqani chayta ruwananmanta
I mean, really bad.	Niyta munani, chiqap mana allin.
But how do you just do it.	Ichaqa imaynatataq chaylla ruwanki.
I didn’t see what it was	Manam rikurqanichu ima kasqanmanta
I think he is a good man.	Allin runa kasqanmantam piensani.
I'll do this.	Kayta ruwasaq.
That lasted about ten years.	Chayqa chunka wata hinan karqan.
It’s not easy to do.	Manam facilchu ruwayqa.
I thought it was there	Chaypi kasqanmantam piensarqani
That was the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allinmi karqan.
I didn't think of that	Chaytaqa manam piensarqanichu
He did it very well	Chaytaqa ancha allintam ruwarqa
I think you did that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwasqaykita.
I really have no idea how long that will last	Cheqaqtapunin mana yuyaykunichu hayk’a tiempo chay kananta
But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.
But I won’t be here	Ichaqa manan kaypichu kasaq
Twice as fast.	Iskay kuti aswan utqaylla.
He didn’t really want to talk.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu rimayta munarqan.
Probably nothing.	Yaqapaschá mana imapas kanchu.
He is a human being.	Payqa runam.
I wanted to talk more	Astawan rimayta munarqani
What is this?.	Imataq kay?.
I’m hurt as a human being	Runa hinam k’irisqa kani
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
Not one, many.	Mana huk, achka.

That will be the worst.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi kanqa.
I did a bad job	Mana allintam ruwarqani
It didn’t go well.	Manam allintachu rirqa.
I didn’t know what to say to anyone	Manam yacharqanichu pimanpas ima niyta
He had no intention of going.	Payqa manan riyta yuyaykurqanchu.
I don't know what's wrong	Manam yachanichu ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I was never sure why	Manam haykapipas segurochu karqani imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
He does, how.	Payqa ruwan, imaynatataq.
I know you want to help	Yachanim yanapayta munasqaykita
But that wasn’t the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu karqan.
You really want to.	Chiqaptam munanki.
I haven’t tried this yet.	Manaraqmi kayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
Okay, everything is fine.	Allinmi, tukuy imapas allinmi.

I couldn’t talk to him	Manam paywan rimayta atirqanichu
But no, not really.	Ichaqa manan, cheqaqtachu.
Everything will be fine	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa
I just can’t help it.	Chaylla mana yanapayta atinichu.
I knew you were gone.	Yacharqanim manaña kasqaykita.
Then a second one.	Chaymanta huk iskay kaq.
I’ve always wanted to know about it	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaymanta yachayta munarqani
I was very happy too	Ñuqapas ancha kusisqam karqani
I really, really, am	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam, kani
I knew this would probably take some time	Yacharqanim kayqa yaqapaschá huk tiempota pasananta
If he had done this, if he had done that.	Sichus kayta ruwanman karqan, sichus chayta ruwanman karqan chayqa.
Wonderful.	Aswan sumaq.
He is not here.	Payqa manam kaypichu kachkan.
Maybe it was the case.	Ichapas chayna karqa.
I didn't really think this through	Kaytaqa manam allintachu piensarqani
I thought you wanted this.	Kayta munasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
I never thought of that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa piensarqanichu.
He seemed very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa hinam karqa.
I don’t know, really.	Manam yachanichu, chiqaptaqa.
I know that you do.	Yachanim chaynata ruwasqaykita.
Maybe it was true.	Ichapas chiqap karqa.
He’s a little different.	Payqa huk chikan.
I knew it was going to be a big deal.	Yacharqanim hatun ruway kananta.
Said no one, ever.	Nisqa mana pipas, haykapipas.
He couldn’t believe it, he didn’t want to believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu, manan creeyta munarqanchu.
It’s just not good enough.	Chaylla mana allinchu.
Maybe it’s good for you.	Ichapas qampaq allin kanman.
I didn’t mean to say.	Manam niyta munarqanichu.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
But I didn’t want to	Ichaqa manan munarqanichu
I love talking a lot about everything	Tukuy imamanta anchata rimayta anchata munani
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
I couldn’t do it	Manam ruwayta atirqanichu
It’s probably pretty good.	Yaqapaschá ancha allin.
I’m a little different.	Ñuqaqa huk chikan chikan kani.
Very, very big.	Ancha, ancha hatun.
Nothing else can do it.	Manan imapas huk ruwayqa atinmanchu.
He is a strong man.	Payqa sinchi runam.
I think that's what it is	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani

Now that was interesting.	Kunanqa chayqa sumaqmi karqan.
Great! 	Hatun!

It’s too good to be true.	Ancha allinmi chiqap kananpaq.
I really don't know why.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu imarayku.

Someone had to do it.	Pipas chayta ruwanan karqan.
You don’t know about anything.	Manam imamantapas yachankichu.

I didn’t think of that	Manam chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu
I can’t believe how beautiful you are	Mana creeyta atiymanchu imayna sumaq kasqaykita
I couldn’t tell before	Ñawpaqtaqa manam willayta atirqanichu
He can't talk now.	Mana kunan rimayta atinchu.
I really wanted to do it	Chiqaptam ruwayta munarqani
I have never been able to do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa atirqanichu
But he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
You weren’t happy.	Manam kusisqachu karqanki.
I was never able to figure out the true nature of it	Manam haykapipas chiqap imayna kasqanmantaqa yachayta atirqanichu
He doesn’t want to.	Payqa manam munanchu.
I never knew there were so many	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu chayna achka kasqankuta
But not to anyone.	Ichaqa manan pimanpas.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
Maybe too much.	Ichapas anchata.
I don’t know now.	Manam kunanqa yachanichu.
I just didn’t see how	Chaylla mana rikurqanichu imaynatachus chayta
There was nothing wrong with this.	Kaypiqa manam imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I had no idea this happened	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kay pasasqanmanta
I think it will be good	Yuyaykuni allin kanqa
I still couldn't figure it out.	Kunankamapas manam yachayta atirqanichu.
I really don't know what.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu imatam.
This is a good thing though.	Kayqa allinmi ichaqa.
I didn’t think of that either	Ñuqapas manam chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu
I wonder if it does	Tapukunitaqmi sichus chayta ruwan
I don’t want it to be any other way	Manam munanichu huk hina kananta
It went well for a while.	Huk tiempo allintam rirqa.
That would not have been easy.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu kanman karqan.
Tell me something.	Imatapas willay.
I think he is a good man	Allin runa kasqanmantam piensani
He says he’s not sure.	Payqa mana segurochu kani nin.
I didn't think he could keep up	Manam piensarqanichu chayman hina ruwayta atisqanmanta
I know what he wants to do	Yachanim ima ruway munasqanmanta
I wanted to talk to you	Qanwan rimayta munarqani
He was really good.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin allin karqan.
I didn’t know what to say	Manam yacharqanichu ima niyta
I don’t mean to say.	Manam niyta munanichu.
He doesn’t look like much.	Payqa manan anchatachu rikch’akun.
Hard to say, no one really knows for sure.	Sasa niyta, mana pipas chiqaptapuni yachanchu seguro.
I'm going to do that.	Chayta ruwasaq risaq.
She was really nice.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
This is so much better.	Kayqa ancha aswan allinmi.
It is still very fast.	Hinallam ancha utqaylla kachkan.
Probably nothing.	Yaqapaschá mana imapas kanchu.
It was a bit different from everything else.	Tukuy imamanta huk chikan kasqa.
I didn’t know at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manam yacharqanichu
If you think about it, it will be good why.	Sichus yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi kanqa imarayku.
I couldn’t figure out what	Manam imamanta yachayta atirqanichu
That didn’t mean there was nothing here.	Chayqa manan niyta munarqanchu kaypi mana imapas kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to believe it	Manam creeyta munarqanichu
I want to help you	Yanapayta munani
I didn’t intend to do this	Manam kayta ruwayta yuyaykurqanichu
Everything but nothing.	Tukuy imapas ichaqa mana ima.
He’s not really there.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chaypi kashan.
This is not easy	Kayqa manam facilchu
He is happy now.	Payqa kunan kusisqa kachkan.
I think something bad happened	Yuyaykuni huk mana allin kaq pasasqanmanta
I'm afraid.	Manchakuni.
I know that for sure	Chaytaqa allintam yachani
I didn’t know it was there	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi kasqanmanta
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But.	Ichaqa.
I want to know what’s going on.	Imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta munani.
I wanted something more	Astawan imatapas munarqani
But that is no longer the case.	Ichaqa manañan chayqa allinchu.
He was very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa kasharqan.
I didn’t know how to do it	Manam yacharqanichu imayna ruwayta
He actually wanted this thing bad.	Payqa chiqaptaqa kay imapas mana allintam munarqa.
Not quite yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu.
I thought it was very real	Ancha chiqap kasqanmantam piensarqani
He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Why are we the ones.	¿Imanasqataq kanchik.
I'm so sorry.	Anchatam llakikuni.
I mean, really be with him	Niyta munani, chiqaptapuni paywan kay
Hopefully, it will be.	Munaymanmi, chayna kananta.
I know what he means	Yachanim ima niyta munasqanmanta
You think you’re doing the right thing.	Allinta ruwasqaykita yuyanki.
I wonder why that is.	Tapukunitaqmi imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to know what was going on	Manam imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta munarqanichu
I would be fine now	Kunanqa allinmi kayman
He is doing a good job.	Payqa allintam ruwachkan.
I wanted to tell you.	Willayta munarqani.
That was a long time ago.	Chayqa unayñan karqan.
This is obviously wrong.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.
But I don’t like it	Ichaqa manan gustawanchu
What is this.	Imataq kay.
But it can’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
You know, big deal.	Yachanki, hatun ruway.
I didn't know this.	Kaytaqa manam yacharqanichu.
Not here, though.	Mana kaypichu.
I didn’t want to know any more	Manañam astawan yachayta munarqanichu
That’s not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanqa.
That would have been the case.	Chayna kanman karqa.
You have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki tiyan.
That’s really important here.	Chayqa kaypiqa ancha allinmi.
Obviously that wasn’t the case here.	Sut’inmi kaypi mana chay hinachu karqan.
Hopefully it will be sooner rather than later	Munaymanmi aswan utqaylla kananta aswan tarde kananpaq
Such a nice guy.	Chayna sumaq runa.
To do that, he said.	Chayta ruwananpaq.
I'll do it today.	Kunanmi ruwasaq.
I know exactly what he thinks	Allintam yachani ima piensasqanmanta
That would be the coffee.	Chayqa kanman karqan chay kukata.
It looked beautiful.	Sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
I hope all is well with you	Suyachkani tukuy imapas allin kananpaq qampaq
How could it be.	Imaynataq kanman.
I knew he meant it	Yacharqanim chayna niyta munasqanmanta
The first night.	Ñawpaq kaq tuta.
I thought that was really interesting	Chaytaqa ancha sumaqmi nispaymi piensarqani
I doubt it’s that important	Iskayrayani chayna ancha allin kasqanmanta
I did that most of the day.	Chaytaqa yaqa tukuy punchawmi ruwarqani.
If this is what you want.	Sichus kayta munanki chayqa.
I'm really sorry.	Chiqaptam llakikuni.
I am very sorry about that	Chaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni
He knew though.	Payqa yacharqanmi ichaqa.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
This is obvious.	Kayqa sut’inmi.
But it’s not like this.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu.
I didn’t want him to come with me	Manam munarqanichu ñuqawan hamunanta
I was very sure.	Ancha segurom karqani.
This seems almost unlikely.	Kayqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu kanman hina.
It would be wonderful to do so.	Chayta ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman.
I know you have always wanted to go there	Yachanim chayman riyta haykapipas munasqaykita
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
I want to do this right	Kaytaqa allintam ruwayta munani
I'm not sure what's wrong	Manam segurochu kani ima mana allin kasqanmanta
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
That’s not the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu.
I know what night.	Yachanim ima tuta.
I’m sure you’ll do well.	Seguro kani allinta ruwanaykipaq.
He said it wasn't.	Payqa nirqam mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He is with her now.	Payqa kunanmi paywan kachkan.
I wonder how he did it	Tapukuni imaynatataq chayta ruwarqa
I didn’t know you were here	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi kasqaykita
This thing did it.	Kay imapas ruwarqa.
You can’t afford to fail.	Manan atiwaqchu mana allinta ruwanaykipaqqa.
It can still be.	Hinallam kanman.
I know that for a fact	Chaytaqa cheqaqtapunin yachani
Now I think that is the case.	Kunanqa chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
How true, now.	Imayna chiqap, kunan.
I want her to be happy again	Munani hukmanta kusisqa kananta
You know that, man.	Chaytaqa yachanki, runa.
You can’t do anything about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I think you just have to do it	Chaylla ruwanayki kasqanmantam piensani
He was happy now, very happy.	Payqa kunan kusisqa kasqa, ancha kusisqa.
I’m better off.	Aswan allinmi kani.
It was really hard	Chiqaptam sasa karqa
I want it to be a good time	Munani allin tiempo kananta
I just couldn’t tell	Chaylla mana willayta atirqanichu
I know what they are like.	Yachanim imayna kasqankuta.
He is here with me now.	Kunan ñuqawan kaypi kachkan.
He does what he says he will do.	Nisqanman hinam ruwan.
There is no one.	Manan pipas kanchu.
But it certainly isn’t.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu.
That’s the best thing.	Chayqa aswan allinmi.
I almost didn’t see it	Yaqapaschá mana rikurqanichu
That was difficult, very difficult.	Chayqa sasa karqa, ancha sasa.
Saying this.	Kayta nispa.
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
I can’t do anything about that.	Chaytaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
He has always been like that.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
I didn’t mean that	Manam chayta niyta munarqanichu
I knew you meant it	Yacharqanim chayna nisqaykita
That’s really nice.	Chayqa chiqap sumaqmi.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
But that was a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi karqan.
I can’t believe it	Manam creeyta atinichu
That shouldn’t be the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I think that is wrong.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
He knows what’s going on.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I don’t know what it is	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmantaqa
He certainly will though.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ichaqa ruwanqa.
Some other things.	Wakin huk imakuna.
This is really good.	Kayqa chiqap allinmi.
Two very large men.	Iskay ancha hatun runa.
I thought that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
This would be almost too good to be true.	Kayqa yaqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I’m not sure what the big deal is	Manam segurochu kani ima hatun ruway kasqanmanta
I knew this would happen	Yacharqanim kay pasananta
I don’t know what.	Mana yachanichu imata.
I didn’t know he was here	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi kasqanmanta
It was a beautiful sight.	Sumaqmi karqa.
Maybe that was a good thing.	Ichapas chayqa allin karqa.
Now I want to know everything	Kunanqa tukuy imatam yachayta munani
Tom would never be good enough.	Tomqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanman.
I didn’t know what to make of this	Manam yacharqanichu kaymanta imata ruwanaypaq
I almost want him to	Yaqapaschá munani chayta ruwananta
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
That will be more obvious.	Chayqa aswan sut’inmi kanqa.
I didn’t want to say anything	Manam imatapas niyta munarqanichu
The man who.	Chay runa.
I can’t say what will happen	Manam niyta atiymanchu imakuna pasananta
But I really can’t comment on that	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
It didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu karqa.
I didn’t see it all being good	Manam rikurqanichu tukuy imapas allin kananpaq
I couldn’t believe it	Manam creeyta atirqanichu
I almost didn’t want to	Yaqapaschá mana munarqanichu
I was terrified the whole time	Tukuy tiempon mancharisqa karqani
Nothing really big.	Mana imapas chiqap hatun.
But he didn’t do it right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
He was alright though.	Payqa allinmi karqan ichaqa.
I would love to know what it’s like	Anchatan munani imayna kasqanmanta yachayta
I’m afraid of everything.	Tukuy imatam manchakuni.
But not yet, yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi, kunankamapas.
I was with him all day	Tukuy punchawmi paywan karqani
It is a very important thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
I could not have been happier.	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atiymanchu karqa.
This should be interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi kanan.
Things were really good at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa imapas ancha allinmi karqa.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinmi karqa.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa.
I really like this one.	Kayqa anchatam gustan.
I’m a bad person.	Mana allin runam kani.
I was happier than ever	Aswan kusisqam karqani
I meant it right.	Allintam niyta munarqani.
I didn’t know how to do it or what to say	Manam yacharqanichu imayna ruwayta nitaq ima niyta
I’m a good guy	Allin runam kani
I know what it’s like.	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta.
I wonder why he did that	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayta ruwarqa nispa
They don’t care.	Paykunaqa manan imananpaschu.
I can’t tell what he wants	Manam willayta atinichu ima munasqanmanta
I did that every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwaq kani.
I want to know all about it	Tukuy chayta yachayta munani
Not not how.	Mana mana imayna.
I know where he lives.	Yachanim maypi yachasqanmanta.
I really can’t believe it	Cheqaqtapunin mana creeyta atiymanchu
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
I doubt it very much.	Anchatam iskayrayani.
But it’s not anymore.	Ichaqa manañan.
It really doesn’t matter.	Chiqaptaqa manam imananpaschu.
Do something better.	Imatapas aswan allinta ruway.
No one can do it.	Manan pipas atinmanchu.
Well.	Allin.

I know this is not going to be easy	Yachanim kayqa mana facilchu kananta
I can’t do it.	Manam ruwayta atiymanchu.
I really hope not	Chiqaptam suyachkani mana
You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
I know it is true.	Yachanim chiqap kasqanmanta.
I don't know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
But it failed miserably.	Ichaqa sinchitan mana allintachu ruwarqan.
He was terrified.	Payqa mancharisqa kasqa.
She would never be alone again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas sapallanchu kanman karqan.
I know how hard this is	Yachanim kay imayna sasa kasqanmanta
I knew this was going to be bad	Yacharqanim kayqa mana allin kananta
I had to do something now	Kunanmi imatapas ruwanay karqa
I just don’t know.	Chaylla mana yachanichu.
It’s today.	Kunan punchawmi.
I didn't want anyone to get hurt	Manam munarqanichu pipas k'irisqa kananta
That would be a very good thing	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman
It should be clear.	Sut’inmi kanan.
No, this is not a good thing.	Manan, kayqa manan allinchu.
It’s going to be nice.	Sumaqmi kanqa.
Probably more than one.	Yaqapaschá hukmanta aswan achka.
I couldn't do without it	Manam mana chayna kasqanmantaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It was really great.	Chiqaptam ancha allin karqa.
It certainly can be.	Cheqaqtapunin kanman.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
I don’t know what.	Manam yachanichu imata.
I know where this is	Yachanim maypi kay kasqanmanta
This was not a bad thing.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu karqa.
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.
I'm sure you know what it's like.	Seguro yachanki imayna kasqanmanta.
I’m sorry, but you’re human.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa runam kanki.
He can do better.	Payqa aswan allintan ruwanman.
It can mean everything.	Tukuy imatam niyta atinman.
I think there is something here.	Kaypiqa imapas kasqanmantam piensani.
I can’t really say	Manam chiqaptaqa niyta atiymanchu
I am not sure how long it will take	Manam segurochu kani hayka tiempo pasananta
A good guy.	Huk allin runa.
I knew it was late, too late	Yacharqanim tarde kasqanmanta, ancha tarde kasqanmanta
I certainly thought about it.	Cheqaqtapunin chaypi yuyaykurqani.
Really good.	Chiqap allin.
He was that good.	Payqa chayna allinmi karqa.
Everything he had to do.	Tukuy ima ruwanan karqa.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.

That’s when it happened.	Chayqa hayk’aqmi karqan.
I want to know if that is the case	Chayna kasqanmantam yachayta munani
Something was better than nothing.	Imapas aswan allinmi karqa mana imamantapas.
Which is great.	Imataq hatun.
The worst part of it.	Aswan mana allin kaq.
The second is the	Iskay kaq.
I didn’t think anything of it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yuyaykurqanichu.
He knew he had done it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I wonder if it’s okay.	Allinchu kasqanmanta tapukuni.
Says he did, sure.	Nin chayta ruwarqan, seguro.
Like the real thing.	Chiqap kaq hina.
Another wonderful day though	Huk sumaq punchaw ichaqa

I didn’t know where he was	Manam yacharqanichu maypi kasqanmanta
It should be alone.	Sapallan kanan.
He was like that.	Payqa hinam karqa.
I mean, nobody knows that.	Niyta munani, chaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
No one can ever know.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas yachayta atinmanchu.
Probably not quite yet.	Yaqapaschá manaraq allintachu.
But it looks good.	Ichaqa allinmi rikchakun.
I don’t know what it is yet.	Manaraqmi yachanichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
Where was it located.	Maypitaq kasqa.
I couldn’t be happier	Manam aswan kusisqa kayta atirqanichu
It won’t be any less safe.	Manan aswan pisi segurochu kanqa.
I think that's really cool.	Chayqa chiqap sumaq kasqanmantam piensani.
I knew he was scared	Yacharqanim mancharisqa kasqanmanta
I think he’s been sad for a long time	Yuyaykuni unayñan llakisqa kashan
I’m not going to do this right.	Manam allintachu kayta ruwasaq.
Someone else did it.	Huk runam chayta ruwarqa.
That means, it’s very good.	Chayqa, ancha allinmi niyta munan.
He doesn’t want to tell.	Manam willayta munanchu.
I will always be here.	Sapa kutim kaypi kasaq.
It was never bad.	Manam haykapipas mana allinchu karqa.
I don’t care what it is.	Manam imananpaschu ima kasqanmantaqa.
Everything was wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allinchu kasqa.
That was never really the case.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu karqan.

Everything looks nice.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi rikchakun.
That is still the case today.	Chayqa kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.

I never thought he would come here	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu kayman hamunanta
I would never do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
I knew it was going to happen.	Yacharqanim chayna kananta.
Can you believe it?.	¿Creeyta atiwaqchu?.
I never saw that happen	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu chayna pasananta
Someone else has to do it.	Chaytaqa huk runam ruwanan.
In fact, it could have been worse.	Chiqaptaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqa.
This is not the case.	Kayqa manam.
He was very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa kasqa.
He is very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.

Every night, if you want.	Sapa tuta, munaspaqa.
I knew he would	Yacharqanim chayta ruwananta
I have been here for two days	Iskay punchawmi kaypi kachkani
What was there in it.	Imataq chaypi karqa.
Ten good, ten bad.	Chunka allin, chunka mana allin.
If you don’t, never mind.	Mana chayta ruwanki chayqa, ama hayk’aqpas imananpaschu.
I can’t tell you what he did	Manam willayta atiymanchu ima ruwasqanmanta
I don't think it is	Mana chayna kasqanmantam piensani
That’s the best thing.	Chayqa aswan allinmi.
I know what will happen.	Yachanim imakuna pasananta.
But you’ll have to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanayki kanqa.
I don’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachanichu.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
I knew it was going to happen	Yacharqanim chayna kananta
One who doesn’t.	Huk mana ruwaq.
Maybe something else.	Ichapas huk imapas.
I mean, nothing.	Niyta munani, mana imapas.
He didn’t know it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu.
It’s not like every day.	Manam sapa punchaw hinachu.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
I did it right	Allintam ruwarqani
I wouldn’t do that, you know.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu, yachanki.
I’ve wanted to do that for a long time.	Unayñan chayta ruwayta munani.
That really means something.	Chayqa chiqaptam imatapas niyta munan.
But it’s not very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu.
Probably not.	Yaqapaschá mana.
I think that's what it is	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani
I would love to win this	Kayta atipayta anchata munani
In the city.	Llaqtapi.
I didn’t know how to tell what was wrong	Manam yacharqanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta imayna willayta
But he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I know that’s the case.	Chaytaqa yachanim.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
But it can’t be that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu kanman.
I know this is a bad time	Yachanim kayqa mana allin tiempo kasqanmanta
I thought you might want to help.	Yuyarqanim ichapas yanapayta munanki.
I can’t do everything.	Manam tukuy imatapas ruwaymanchu.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
I wonder how it is	Imayna kasqanmantam tapukuni
I couldn't believe it took so long	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chay achka tiempo pasasqanmanta
That’s what I wanted to tell you	Chaytan willayta munarqani
Like a day.	Huk punchaw hina.
I thought that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani
I plan to do this every other day.	Chaytaqa sapa iskay punchawmi ruwanaypaq yuyaykuni.
I’ve done it.	Ñuqaqa ruwarqani.
It doesn’t matter to anyone anymore	Manañam pimanpas imananpaschu
Please.	Ama hina.
I hope not.	Suyachkani mana.
I know something.	Imatapas yachani.
I was very excited.	Ancha kusisqam karqani.
I was hurt too, after all	Ñuqapas k’irisqa karqani, tukuy imamanta
I didn’t know that.	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu.
Quickly, if you will.	Utqaylla, munaspaqa.
I think it is there now.	Kunanqa chaypi kasqanmantam piensani.
That it isn’t.	Mana chayna kasqanmanta.
But someone else did.	Ichaqa huk runam chayta ruwarqa.
That’s the best thing.	Chayqa aswan allinmi.
I don’t want to.	Manam munanichu.
But now he had to do something.	Ichaqa kunanmi imatapas ruwanan karqa.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
It would be very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi kanman.
He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manan atirqanchu.
I didn’t see anything	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu
I didn’t really want that	Manam chiqaptachu chaytaqa munarqani
I can’t do it right	Manam allinta ruwayta atiymanchu
He is a human being.	Payqa runam.
I can’t get over that	Chaytaqa manam atipayta atiymanchu
He couldn’t face this now.	Payqa manan kunanqa kayta atipayta atirqanchu.
I wasn’t happy.	Manam kusisqachu karqani.
Maybe it was the case.	Ichapas chayna karqa.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
You are a bigger person	Aswan hatun runam kanki
He did, apparently.	Payqa ruwarqa, yaqapaschá.
No, it’s not like saying the word.	Manan, manan simita nisqa hinachu.
Why not? 	Imanasqa mana?
But that’s not the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu.
No one is happy.	Manan pipas kusisqachu kashan.
But how about.	Ichaqa imayna.
I know he would have wanted you to	Yachanim payqa munanman karqa chayna kasqaykita
Maybe it doesn’t exist.	Ichapas mana kanchu.
I was tired and angry	Sayk’usqa, phiñasqa ima karqani
New.	Musuq.
I just couldn’t help it	Chaylla mana yanapayta atirqanichu
That’s not always the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
The largest one.	Aswan hatun kaq.
Things could not have gone any better.	Manam aswan allintachu imapas kanman karqa.
I know it will be here	Yachanim kaypi kananta
But the future is bright.	Ichaqa hamuq tiempopiqa sumaqmi kanqa.
I knew he would be unhappy.	Yacharqanim mana kusisqa kananta.
I know this is hard.	Yachanim kayqa sasa kasqanmanta.
I’m really going to go.	Chiqaptam risaq.
I think it would be a great, great thing	Yuyaykuni hatun, hatun ruway kanman
That’s what it means.	Chaytan niyta munan.
The strong one, he is.	Sinchi kaq, payqa.
Nothing is right, nothing is as it should be.	Mana imapas allinchu, mana imapas kanan hinachu.
But.	Ichaqa.
Great man, great man	Hatun runa, hatun runa
I know you are worried	Yachanim llakisqa kasqaykita
No, you can’t.	Manan, manan atiwaqchu.
I think it went well	Allintam rirqa nispaymi piensani
I was sure there was more	Seguro karqani aswan achka kasqanmanta
Else.	Mana chayqa.
I hope you are.	Suyachkani chayna kasqaykita.
He will certainly be better now.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kunanqa aswan allin kanqa.
He wants something.	Imatapas munan.
I’m sorry, too.	Ñuqapas pampachaykuway.
It wasn’t bad, it was really good.	Manam mana allinchu karqa, chiqap allinmi karqa.
I didn’t know about it	Manam chaymantaqa yacharqanichu
I hope you are	Suyachkani chayna kasqaykita
The best part, actually.	Aswan allin kaq, chiqaptaqa.
I can’t believe he would	Mana creeyta atinichu chayta ruwananta
He wants to, you know.	Payqa munan, yachanki.
I know you've been there	Yachanim chaypi kasqaykita
Otherwise I wouldn’t do it.	Mana chayqa manan ruwaymanchu.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
That was not an easy task	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu karqan
It wouldn’t be easy.	Manam facilchu kanman.
I can’t do that	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atiymanchu
You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
For doing the deed.	Chay ruwayta ruwasqanmanta.
He realized that no one wanted to do that	Payqa repararqanmi mana pipas chayta ruwayta munasqanmanta
It certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
You’re going to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwanki.
He knows everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yachan.
It's very clear.	Ancha sut'inmi.
Things might not be right.	Imapas manapaschá allinchu kanman.
He had to do this.	Kayta ruwanan karqan.
I’m sure he did.	Seguro kani chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I knew he was scared	Yacharqanim mancharisqa kasqanmanta
You certainly know something.	Cheqaqtapunin imatapas yachanki.
He certainly did.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.
It could have been worse, you know.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan, yachanki.
Now that would be anything!.	Kunanqa chayqa imapas kanman!.
It’s still going on.	Hinallam kachkan.
I knew this was not going to be easy.	Yacharqanim kayqa mana facilchu kananta.
How that might be he didn't know, but he knew.	Imayna chay kanman chaytaqa manan yacharqanchu, ichaqa yacharqanmi.
I really want a cup of coffee	Anchatam munani huk kukata
I really want to support that	Chaytaqa anchatam yanapayta munani
The best person.	Aswan allin runa.
Here are a few.	Kaypi huk iskay kimsa.
I'm not going to go very long	Manam ancha unaytachu risaq
Yes, I do, too.	Arí, ñuqapas.
It was a long time ago.	Unayñan karqan.
I never thought it would happen	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna kananta
I knew something was wrong	Yacharqanim imapas mana allin kasqanmanta
One by one, one by one.	Hukmanta hukmanta.
I want to make sure it’s just that	Chaylla kasqanmanta seguro kayta munani
I don’t know what to say	Manam yachanichu ima niyta
I thought he did a really great job.	Yuyarqanim chiqap hatun llamkayta ruwasqanmanta.
Otherwise he had a bleak future.	Mana chayqa mana allin hamuq tiempon karqan.
This is what happened to me.	Kay hinam ñuqawanqa karqa.
He realized that he knew that wouldn't happen.	Payqa repararqanmi chay mana pasananta yachasqanmanta.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
Everything will be fine.	Lliwmi allin kanqa.
I don’t want to know anything	Manam imatapas yachayta munanichu
He was a very nice guy.	Payqa llumpay sumaq runam karqa.
I can’t be this.	Manam kayta atiymanchu.
Maybe it was now.	Ichapas kunan tiempo karqa.
In fact, it’s pretty big.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha hatun.
Do it every year.	Sapa wata ruway.
I know how hard it is for you today	Yachanim kunan punchaw qampaq imayna sinchi kasqanmanta
I didn’t want to talk about it	Manam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu
I used to be a happy person.	Ñawpaqtaqa kusisqa runam karqani.
I don't know what to do.	Manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
You can’t do that	Chaytaqa manam atiwaqchu
He wasn't here.	Payqa manam kaypichu karqa.
I couldn’t do this	Manam kaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I didn’t know what to do	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanaypaq
You don’t really know anything yet.	Manaraqmi chiqaptaqa imatapas yachankichu.
I knew it would be good one day	Yacharqanim huk punchaw allin kananpaq
I mean, it’s really good	Niyta munani, chiqap allinmi
I don’t know where it is	Manam yachanichu maypi kasqanmanta
I’m not happy though.	Manam kusisqachu kani ichaqa.
He is present now.	Payqa kunanmi kachkan.
He’s been gone for a long time.	Unayñan manaña kanchu.
I want to know more	Astawan yachayta munani
That says something, actually.	Chayqa imatapas nin, chiqaptaqa.
Something is really wrong.	Chiqaptam imapas mana allinchu.
The right thing to do.	Allin kaq.
I never knew why.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
I am very happy indeed	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chiqaptapuni
Slightly uncomfortably, perhaps .	Pisi mana allintachu, ichapas .
I think that's what it is	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani
It looks good now.	Kunanqa allinmi rikchakun.
I wouldn't be here long	Manam unaytachu kaypi kayman karqa
I still don’t know.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu.
That’s not this.	Chay mana kay.
That would have been really bad.	Chayqa chiqap mana allinmi kanman karqa.
That wasn’t always the case	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina karqan
There’s that.	Chaypi chaymanta.
Two to go.	Iskay rinanpaq.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan.
I didn't think it would happen	Manam piensarqanichu chayna pasananta
This is a good thing for you to do.	Kayqa allinmi qampaq ruwanaykipaq.
I know why he did it.	Yachanim imanasqa chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Now, he knew why.	Kunanqa, payqa yacharqanmi imarayku chayta.
I've never seen that before.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
What’s going to happen? 	¿Imataq kanqa?
No, it doesn’t matter.	Manan, manan imananpaschu.
Maybe you’re on to something.	Ichapas imapipas kachkanki.
If you want to.	Munaspaqa.
It looks like it could be.	Chayqa kanman hinam rikchakun.
I’m so angry and upset.	Ancha phiñasqa, phiñasqa ima kani.
I didn't know what to do	Manañam ima ruwanayta yacharqanichu
It was better than that.	Aswan allinmi karqa.
But you know better.	Ichaqa aswan allintan yachanki.
He knows they are there.	Payqa yachanmi chaypi kasqankuta.
Maybe.	Ichapas.
Now it’s faster.	Kunanqa aswan utqaylla.
He knows where you are.	Maypi kasqaykita yachan.
Probably not.	Manapaschá.
I didn’t really know why	Manam chiqaptaqa yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
I’m a scared person.	Ñuqaqa mancharisqa runam kani.
I think that’s what he wants.	Chaytan payqa munan, nispan yuyaykuni.
I thought he was happy	Kusisqa kasqanmantam piensarqani
He did everything wrong.	Payqa tukuy imatam mana allinta ruwarqa.
I knew it was better than that	Yacharqanim chaymanta aswan allin kasqanmanta
Very, very bad.	Ancha, ancha mana allin.
I know that for sure	Chaytaqa allintam yachani
There isn’t.	Mana kanchu.
This was last week.	Kayqa qayna semanan karqan.
I wish you were here	Munaymanmi kaypi kasqaykita
I don't know what to do	Manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
I almost wished he hadn’t	Yaqapaschá mana chayta ruwananta munarqani
I know how to swim	Nadayta yachani
It would have been nice	Sumaqmi kanman karqa
However, such an approach is uncertain.	Ichaqa manan segurochu chay hina ruwayqa.
I didn’t see anything	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu
That means a lot.	Chayqa anchatam niyta munan.
I know what it’s like.	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta.
No, actually, that's not quite right.	Manan, chiqaptaqa, chayqa manam allintachu.
I don’t want to play there.	Chaypi pukllayta mana munanichu.
But that is not really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chayqa.
It's a very good day.	Ancha allin punchaw.
I wanted to do things right	Allintam imatapas ruwayta munarqani
But he's still not sure it's right.	Ichaqa hinallam mana segurochu kachkan allin kasqanmanta.
I almost got hurt.	Yaqapaschá k’irisqa karqani.
Now he was alone.	Kunanqa sapallanmi kasqa.
I’m a good guy.	Allin runam kani.
I mean you’re human	Runa kasqaykita niyta munani
I knew what was coming next	Yacharqanim chaymanta imakuna hamunanta
You have a great day tomorrow.	Paqarin hatun punchawmi kanki.
This is really hard to do.	Kayqa chiqaptam sasa ruwayqa.
I thought nothing of it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu
Maybe, one day.	Ichapas, huk punchaw.
Three, three.	Kimsa, kimsa.
He is now a man.	Payqa kunanmi runa.
I can’t do this anymore.	Manañam kayta ruwayta atiymanchu.
Do this regularly throughout the day.	Chaytaqa tukuy punchaw sapa kuti ruway.
I want to talk about it	Chaymanta rimayta munani
Maybe it should be.	Ichapas chayna kanan.
I always said it was	Sapa kutim nirqani chayna kasqanmanta
I can't believe this	Kaytaqa manam creeyta atinichu
It’s not that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu.
That’s really nice of me.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqamanta.
I didn’t mean that	Manam chayta niyta munarqanichu
A real person.	Huk chiqap runa.
I don’t know what they are	Manam yachanichu imakuna kasqankuta
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
I mean, he says very sadly	Niyta munani, ancha llakisqa nin
Every night.	Sapa tuta.
I did a lot of wrong things	Achka mana allintam ruwarqani
But he was angry.	Ichaqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
I didn’t know what to say about it	Manam yacharqanichu chaymanta ima niyta
He is a happy man.	Payqa kusisqa runam.
He did it a long time ago.	Payqa unayñan chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I thought nothing of it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa piensarqanichu
I couldn’t go.	Manam riyta atirqanichu.
But I was too good at this	Ichaqa kaypiqa llumpay allinmi karqani
This doesn't seem right.	Kayqa manam allinchu rikchakun.
You can’t be this.	Manam kayta atiwaqchu.
I know what's wrong	Yachanim ima mana allin kasqanmanta
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
It wasn’t easy being with me	Manam facilchu karqa ñuqawan kayqa
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
He certainly was.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin karqan.
He’s not feeling well.	Payqa manan allinchu kashan.
A different approach may not.	Huk hina ruwayqa manapaschá.
I'm always waiting	Sapa kutim suyachkani
But this wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allinchu kanman.
This isn’t the first time.	Kayqa manan ñawpaq kutichu.
I don’t want to have to do it again.	Manam munanichu hukmanta ruwanay kasqanmanta.
I still refused to believe it	Kunankamapas manam creeyta munarqanichu
I want to do it again.	Hukmanta ruwayta munani.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
He didn’t want anything.	Payqa manan imatapas munarqanchu.
He is a beautiful man.	Payqa sumaq runam.
I didn’t really want to know.	Mana chiqaptachu yachayta munarqani.
Actually two things.	Chiqaptaqa iskay imakuna.
I have a lot to do today.	Kunan punchawmi achka ruwanay kachkan.
No, certainly not.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin mana.
I know you are worried	Yachanim llakisqa kasqaykita
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
It wasn’t that good anymore.	Manañam chayna allinchu karqa.
I almost wish it were	Yaqapaschá chayna kananta munani
I was with him that day.	Chay punchawmi paywan karqani.
I can't believe he's sad	Mana creeyta atinichu llakisqa kasqanmanta
But you won’t always succeed.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu allinta ruwanki.
I know a lot more.	Aswan achkatam yachani.
It can never really be man	Mana hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu kanman runa
But I didn’t know what to do	Ichaqa manan yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta
I hope it will be there	Suyachkani chaypi kananta
I can’t do it for you	Manam qampaq ruwayta atiymanchu
I know something is wrong with him	Yachanim imapas mana allin paywan kasqanmanta
You don’t know where you are.	Manam yachankichu maypi kasqaykita.
He knew where he was.	Payqa yacharqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta.
He was a nice guy.	Payqa sumaq runam karqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I was scared, scared, and furious	Mancharisqa, mancharisqa, sinchi phiñasqa ima karqani
He certainly could have done better.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan allinta ruwayta atinman karqan.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
This is a good thing	Kayqa allinmi
I didn’t want to play	Manam pukllayta munarqanichu
I knew it was going to happen	Yacharqanim chayna kananta
I’ve never seen it before.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
I never thought it would happen	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna pasananta
I never really thought it would happen	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa piensarqanichu chayna kananta
This was not what it was supposed to be.	Kayqa manam kanan hinachu karqa.
I didn’t want to say anything about it	Manam chaymantaqa imatapas niyta munarqanichu
He is always here.	Payqa sapa kutim kaypi kachkan.
He is doing a good job.	Payqa allintam ruwachkan.
This was a great experience.	Kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I know you can do anything	Yachanim imatapas ruwayta atisqaykita
You didn’t quite know yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu yacharqanki.
But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.
Do something different.	Huk chikan ruwayta ruway.
I'm sure it will	Seguro kani chayna kananta
Tired of that.	Sayk’usqa chaymanta.
The one that wasn’t injured.	Mana k’irisqa kaq.
I didn’t want to talk to him anymore	Manañan paywan rimayta munarqanichu
But I couldn’t say that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa niyta atirqanichu
But who could that person be?.	Ichaqa, ¿pitaq chay runa kanman?.
I'm not sure how long.	Manam allintachu yachani hayka unayta.
They are human beings.	Paykunaqa runam kanku.
It’s just not here.	Chaylla mana kaypichu.
Maybe there’s something for you	Ichapas qampaq imapas kanman
Then the third.	Chaymanta kimsa kaq.
That was really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi karqa.
Too much time.	Llumpay tiempo.
She was really nice.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
I was there early as usual	Sapa kuti hinam chaypi temprano karqani
This was very bad.	Kayqa ancha mana allinmi karqa.
That was certainly the case.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin karqan.
I don't think that's the case.	Manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensanichu.
I wonder who that person is	Tapukuni pitaq chay runa kasqanmanta
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
First, I’ll make some coffee right away.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaylla kukata ruwasaq.
I think there is some truth to this.	Kaypiqa wakin chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
He is doing very well though.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwachkan ichaqa.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
But this will not be so easy.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu kayqa kanqa.
I know it very well.	Ancha allintam yachani.
Something is very wrong.	Imapas ancha mana allinmi kachkan.
I really wasn’t sure	Chiqaptaqa manam segurochu karqani
I didn’t want that	Chaytaqa manan munarqanichu
Here’s what I need to do	Kaypiqa imakuna ruwanay tiyan
It was pretty obvious why.	Chayqa ancha sut’inmi karqan imarayku.
But you can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atiwaqchu.
I really want to be just that.	Anchatan munani chaylla kayta.
I thought that was the case	Chayqa chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani
I want to work together	Kuska llamkayta munani
I don’t want to be here	Manam kaypi kayta munanichu
Maybe a little too soon.	Ichapas huk chikan ancha utqaylla.
That seems obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi rikch’akun.
I’m asking this.	Kayta tapukuni.
I know you’re doing the right thing	Yachanim allinta ruwasqaykita
If it does, that’s fine.	Sichus chayta ruwan chayqa, allinmi.
He was a human being.	Payqa runam karqa.
But it is very good.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi.
I didn't think anything would be that bad	Manam piensarqanichu imapas chayna mana allin kananpaq
He was too good at this.	Payqa llumpay allinmi karqa kaypi.
You will have to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintan ruwanayki kanqa.
I didn’t know he was here.	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi kasqanmanta.
He said he hoped to come.	Hamuyta suyakusqanmanta nirqa.
I wonder what it is	Tapukuni imataq kasqanmanta
He was the best.	Payqa aswan allinmi karqan.
. . . .	.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
You never knew it.	Qamqa manam haykapipas yacharqankichu.
I want to tell you about something	Imamantapas willayta munani
It’s really important.	Chiqaptam ancha allin.
I just hope no one comes	Chaylla suyachkani mana pipas hamunanta
I didn’t think anyone would get hurt	Manam yuyaykurqanichu pipas k’irisqa kananta
I knew what it could be	Yacharqanim ima kanman chayta
Perhaps they are.	Ichapas chayna kanku.
I knew where he lived	Yacharqanim maypi yachasqanmanta
He was there every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi chaypi karqa.
I didn’t know there were so many	Manam yacharqanichu chayna achka kasqankuta
I almost can’t believe it	Yaqa mana creeyta atinichu
I hope things work out for you	Suyachkani imapas allin kananpaq qampaq
I didn’t know that	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu
Now I really want to know	Kunanqa anchatam yachayta munani
He was all over the place.	Payqa lliwmi kasqa.

I had a good idea of ​​what he was thinking	Allintam yuyaykurqani ima piensasqanmanta
This is neither good nor bad.	Kayqa manam allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.

He knew that now.	Chaytaqa kunanqa yacharqanmi.
But I couldn’t do anything about it	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu
It wasn’t easy.	Manam facilchu karqa.
Maybe it’s not that bad.	Ichapas mana chayna mana allinchu.
I can't say anything about that	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu
I'm not sure this is true.	Manam allintachu yachani kayqa chiqap kasqanmantaqa.

I can’t speak now	Manam kunanqa rimayta atiymanchu
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
Maybe I want to do that	Ichapas chayta ruwayta munani
I know why you did it today	Yachanim imanasqa kunan punchaw ruwasqaykita
You learned a new word today.	Kunan punchawmi huk musuq simita yacharqanki.
I suspect it is.	Sospechani chayna kasqanmanta.
I really want to do that	Anchatan munani chayta ruwanaypaq
I really have to do something	Chiqaptam imatapas ruwanay
I don’t know what.	Manam yachanichu imata.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I'm really looking forward to that.	Chaytaqa anchatam suyachkani.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu.
Now he knew what that thing was.	Kunanqa yacharqanmi imachus chay imapas kasqanmanta.
That is not the case today.	Kunanqa manan chay hinachu.
This isn’t the case.	Kayqa manan kanchu.
That was probably the biggest.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan hatun karqan.
I can’t tell you anymore.	Manañam willayta atinichu.
I haven’t seen it before	Manam ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu
Maybe I’ll have to do it again	Ichapas hukmanta ruwanay kanqa
I thought that was a pretty good move	Chayqa allin allin ruway kasqanmantam piensarqani
He was a very difficult man.	Payqa ancha sasa runam karqa.
I wonder if he knows	Yachanchu icha manachu chayta tapukuni
But now it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan imananpaschu.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
Maybe too soon.	Ichapas ancha utqaylla.
No one can do anything about it.	Manan pipas imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu.
I know very well how good you are.	Ancha allintam yachani imayna allin kasqaykita.
Well.	Allin.
I wasn’t sure how long this would last	Manam segurochu karqani hayka tiempo kayqa kananmanta
But this is a very good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha allinmi.
Something is wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
I can’t do that	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta atiymanchu
I was the one.	Ñuqaqa karqani.
To go with him.	Paywan ripunanpaq.
I don’t know how many there are.	Manam yachanichu hayka kasqanmanta.
He knew it was the right time.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay tiempo allin kasqanmanta.
More on that please.	Astawan chaymanta ama hina kaspa.
It’s not good, but it’s good.	Mana allinchu, ichaqa allinmi.
I don’t want money.	Manam qullqita munanichu.
Not yet.	Manaraq.
A beautiful night.	Huk sumaq tuta.
I want to know why	Imarayku kasqanmanta yachayta munani
He almost refused.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana munarqanchu.
Something doesn't seem right.	Imapas mana allintachu rikchakun.
That’s what it’s going to be.	Chayqa kanqa.
I didn't care that it was	Manam imananpaschu karqa chayna kasqanmantaqa
What is it, is it.	Imataq kachkan, kachkan.
Great great great.	Hatun hatun hatun.
Now this is interesting.	Kunanqa kayqa sumaqmi.
It's actually not too bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam ancha mana allinchu.
I can’t do this now	Kunanqa manan kayta ruwayta atiymanchu
I don't know exactly.	Mana allintachu yachani.
That wasn’t easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan.
Maybe he really means it.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni niyta munan.
Tired but good.	Sayk’usqa ichaqa allin.
I'm sure he is.	Seguro kani payqa kasqanmanta.
He was such a good guy.	Payqa chayna allin runam karqa.
One by one, one by one.	Hukmanta hukmanta.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
He wasn’t alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu karqa.
It looked very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
He wanted everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam munarqa.
Sure, that’s a good thing.	Seguro, chayqa allinmi.
I didn’t want to go.	Manam riyta munarqanichu.
I couldn't figure out where it was	Manam maypi kasqanmantaqa yachayta atirqanichu
He knew how difficult it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna sasa ruway kasqanmanta.
That was pretty safe.	Chayqa ancha segurom karqa.
I am pretty sure of that	Chaymantaqa allintam seguro kani
It’s beautiful.	Sumaqmi.
It is indeed so.	Cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
I am sure of that.	Chaymantaqa segurom kachkani.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.
I can't believe he's gone	Manam creeyta atinichu manaña kasqanmantaqa
I really wanted to know what happened next	Anchatan munarqani chaymanta imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta
I know you won't.	Yachanim mana chayta ruwanaykipaq.
I think very often.	Ancha sapa kutim piensani.
I thought you were someone else.	Huk runa kasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
What? 	Ima?
Yes, yes you are.	Arí, arí qamqa kanki.
That’s really nice.	Chayqa chiqap sumaqmi.
I just didn’t want to believe it	Chaylla mana creeyta munarqanichu
There is no other way to do it.	Manam huk ruwayqa kanchu.
I highly doubt he will come though	Ñuqaqa anchatam iskayrayani payqa hamunanta ichaqa
I wasn’t very happy.	Manam ancha kusisqachu karqani.
She was nicer than that.	Payqa chaymanta aswan sumaqmi karqa.
I wonder what ever happened to him	Tapukunitaqmi ima haykapipas paywan pasasqanmanta
I can’t really say.	Manam chiqaptaqa niyta atiymanchu.
I often wonder what he is doing now.	Sapa kutim tapukuni kunan ima ruwasqanmanta.
Everything is fine	Tukuy imapas allinmi
I couldn’t go there	Manam chayman riyta atirqanichu
Everything else.	Tukuy imapas.
I like it a lot.	Anchatam gustan.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
Man, that would be great.	Runa, chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
This was a very special day	Kayqa ancha hatun punchawmi karqa
More than anything else.	Aswan tukuy imamanta.
You’re going to be happy.	Kusisqam kanki.
Many times.	Achka kuti.
No, it’s not.	Manan, manan.
I know it is not easy for you	Yachanim qampaq mana facilchu kasqanmanta
I never wanted to	Manam haykapipas munarqanichu
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
Thirty-three.	Chunka kimsa chunka.
But everything else.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas.
I think you should do that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
If you want to.	Sichus munanki chayqa.
He was a morning man.	Payqa paqarin runam karqa.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
I want it to be just that	Munani chaylla kananta
I don’t want to help.	Manam yanapayta munanichu.
I hope that it is.	Suyachkani chayna kananpaq.
It probably wouldn’t be better.	Manachá aswan allinchu kanman.
I couldn’t do anything about it	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu
To do that, he said.	Chayta ruwananpaq.
I don’t know what, really.	Mana yachanichu imata, chiqaptapuni.
He was always there.	Sapa kutim chaypi karqa.
I would never do anything	Manam haykapipas imatapas ruwaymanchu karqa
I can’t be this.	Manam kayta atiymanchu.
As always, he probably doesn’t know.	Sapa kuti hina, payqa manapaschá yachanchu.
I don't think that's the case.	Manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensanichu.
That was the first time.	Chayqa ñawpaq kutim karqa.
I can never say how many.	Manam haykapipas niyta atiymanchu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
This was supposed to be.	Kayqa kanan karqan.
I really want to tell you that	Chaytaqa anchatam willayta munani
I didn't think he could do this	Manam piensarqanichu kayta ruway atisqanmanta
This doesn’t mean ‘nice to do’.	Kayqa manan niyta munanchu ‘sumaq ruway’.
Not everything went smoothly.	Manam tukuy imapas allintachu rirqa.
Clearly it’s not.	Sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
First of all, about me.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ñuqamanta.
How am I going to do that.	Imaynatataq chayta ruwasaq.
Man, but more.	Runa, ichaqa aswan.
Probably not.	Manapaschá.
But no one is good enough.	Ichaqa manan pipas allinchu.
I can’t really tell you yet	Manaraqmi chiqaptaqa willayta atiymanchu
He was genuinely excited.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kusisqa kasharqan.
I didn’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu.
I didn’t know what to do	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanaypaq
I didn’t want that.	Chaytaqa manan munarqanichu.
He’s doing well.	Payqa allinmi kachkan.
I know how busy you are	Yachanim imayna ocupasqa kasqaykita
I want to know what’s going on	Imakuna kasqanmanta yachayta munani
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do anything.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana imatapas ruwanaykita.
But you’re still there.	Ichaqa hinallam kachkanki.
I've never seen that before.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
I had to do something	Imapas ruwanay karqa
I’m always there.	Sapa kutim kani.
It’s better than that.	Aswan allinmi chaymantaqa.
I want to know exactly where you are	Maypi kasqaykita allinta yachayta munani
But I know better	Ichaqa aswan allintan yachani
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
He's not sure yet.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kachkan.
I know it’s going to happen.	Yachanim chayna kananta.
It wasn’t a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu karqa.
I always learn something	Sapa kutim imatapas yachani
I didn’t think much of it	Manam anchatachu chaypi piensarqani
I could never figure out what that thing was	Manam haykapipas yachayta atirqanichu ima chay imapas kasqanmantaqa
I won't be here much longer	Manam aswan unaytachu kaypi kasaq
Well, a lot of it.	Allinmi, achka.
He’s better now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan allinmi.
I don’t want to say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta munanichu.
I think that's what it is	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani
But he could never do that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
He is very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
It’s better to be a good person.	Aswan allinmi allin runa kay.
That he’s sure.	Chayqa payqa seguro kasqanmanta.
I am very happy here.	Kaypiqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.
Very, very good	Ancha, ancha allin .
I wasn’t happy about it	Manam chaymantaqa kusisqachu karqani
It was really great.	Chiqaptam ancha allin karqa.
I am sure he will do well.	Payqa allintam ruwananmanta seguro kani.
I thought it was everything.	Tukuy ima kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I still couldn't believe he was with me	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atirqanichu ñuqawan kasqanmanta
I knew he didn't want to be there	Yacharqanim mana chaypi kayta munasqanmanta
I can’t tell you.	Manam willayta atinichu.
I’ve never seen it before	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu
Now they are.	Kunanqa paykunaqa kanku.
Father, father, father.	Ama, ama, ama.
He is no longer available.	Kunanqa manañam kanchu.
I wasn’t in a position to do anything	Manam imatapas ruwanaypaq hinachu karqani
That seemed to be the case.	Chayqa karqan hina.
It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
This process didn’t really do it	Kay ruwayqa manan cheqaqtachu ruwarqan
I may not have said it right	Manapaschá allintachu nirqani
I cannot say what it will be like	Imayna kanqa chaytaqa manam niyta atiymanchu
It didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu karqa.
All very quickly.	Tukuy ancha utqaylla.
I know that for sure	Chaytaqa allintam yachani
I had no idea what would happen	Manam piensarqanichu imakuna pasananta
Yes, yes, yes	Arí, arí, arí .
This isn’t a good thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu.
I am very much about that.	Ñuqaqa chaymantaqa anchatam kani.
I wouldn’t have done anything	Manam imatapas ruwaymanchu karqa
He figured out what to do.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi ima ruwananta.
It’s always the same.	Sapa kutim chayna.
A lot of time.	Achka tiempo.
She is extremely beautiful.	Payqa sinchi sumaqmi.
But now he couldn’t.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan atirqanchu.
I still said it very well.	Kunankamapas ancha allintam nirqani.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
I don’t know why that would happen.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kananta.
He did something about it.	Payqa imatapas ruwarqa.
He was very happy with me.	Payqa ancha kusisqam ñuqawan karqa.
You can’t say it.	Manan niyta atiwaqchu.
He didn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
Maybe a lot, maybe a little bit.	Ichapas achka, ichapas huk chikan.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I thought you would.	Yuyarqanim chayta ruwanaykipaq.
He knew that it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayna kasqanmanta.
He really wanted to talk to her.	Payqa anchatan paywan rimayta munarqan.
I didn’t see how he could	Manam rikurqanichu imayna atisqanmanta
The earlier the better.	Aswan ñawpaqtaqa aswan allinmi.
I mean, yeah.	Niyta munani, arí.
They are the ones.	Paykunaqa kanku.
I'm going to go now.	Kunanmi risaq.
It won’t be easy for you.	Manam facilchu kanqa qampaq.
I was sure of that	Chaymantaqa segurom karqani
He had to do something.	Imatapas ruwanan karqan.
I know it wouldn't be easy	Yachanim mana facilchu kanman
But he seemed happy.	Ichaqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
I didn’t know if he was happy or not	Manam yacharqanichu kusisqachu icha manachu
It wasn’t the case.	Manan chay hinachu karqan.
I know you want to help	Yachanim yanapayta munasqaykita
You certainly do.	Qamqa chiqaptam ruwanki.
I had to do it right	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanay karqa
Night and day.	Tuta punchaw.
If you want to.	Munaspaqa.
He was that good.	Payqa chayna allinmi karqa.
I wonder why that is	Tapukunitaqmi imarayku chayna kasqanmanta
I don’t know what, still	Manam yachanichu imata, kunankamapas
I thought it was really good.	Chiqap allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I really don’t want to know.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachayta munanichu.
I didn’t know why he did it	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa chayta ruwasqanmanta
I'm not sure that's a bad thing.	Manam segurochu kani chay mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
I want to do that one night.	Chayta huk tuta ruwayta munani.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
They are very beautiful.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi kanku.
I hope there is nothing from this.	Suyachkani kaymanta mana imapas kananpaq.
I think I’d better talk to you	Yuyaykuni aswan allin kanman qanwan rimayta
I think it would be a great, great thing.	Yuyaykuni hatun, hatun ruway kanman.
We are two people.	Iskay runam kanchik.
I couldn’t do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
I really want to do that.	Anchatan munani chayta ruwayta.
Maybe something new every week.	Ichapas sapa semana musuq imapas.
This isn’t a good thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu.
It has to be great.	Hatun kanan tiyan.
It has never been easier.	Manam haykapipas aswan facilchu karqa.
I think it would do great good	Yuyaykuni hatun allinta ruwanman
What are you doing here for so long? 	¿Imatataq kaypi unayta ruwanki?
That was a man.	Chayqa huk runam karqa.
He was a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam karqa.
This says a lot.	Kayqa achkatam nin.
Maybe it should be.	Ichapas chayna kanan.
I didn’t really want to.	Manam anchatachu munarqani.
Maybe he did just that.	Ichapas payqa chayta ruwarqa.
. . . .	.
I am not sure why	Manam segurochu kani imarayku kasqanmantaqa
No, it’s better not.	Manan, aswan allinmi mana.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
I didn’t mean you were	Manam niyta munarqanichu chayna kasqaykita
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
But it wouldn’t be a good idea.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman chay ruwayqa.
He’s probably the first person.	Payqa yaqapaschá ñawpaq runa.
He was sad and worried.	Payqa llakisqa, llakisqa kasqa.
If you know, you know.	Yachanki chayqa, yachanki.
He knows the consequences.	Payqa yachanmi chaymanta imakuna kananta.
He’s good at it.	Payqa allinmi chaypi.
Now I have to do this	Kunanqa kayta ruwanay tiyan
He wanted to.	Payqa munarqa.
This means something.	Kayqa imapas niyta munan.
I couldn’t be either	Ñuqapas manam kayta atirqanichu
He wasn’t happy.	Manam kusisqachu karqa.
It does the job.	Chay llamk’ayta ruwan.
I can’t talk about it	Manam chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu
We are human beings.	Runa kanchik.
But of course it’s not.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
I'm so sorry.	Anchatam llakikuni.
Everything is not good for you.	Tukuy imapas manam allinchu qampaq.
I can’t help it	Manam yanapayta atiymanchu
I can't buy that	Chaytaqa manam rantiyta atiymanchu
I couldn't tell you that.	Chaytaqa manam willayta atirqanichu.
Perhaps he should have.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanan karqan.
I know what he thinks	Yachanim ima piensasqanmanta
Wouldn’t that really be better?!.	¿Manachu chayqa chiqaptapuni aswan allin kanman?!.
This was just another one.	Kayqa huk hinallam karqa.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
I'm actually happy	Chiqaptaqa kusisqam kachkani
Yes, it’s all there.	Arí, tukuy chaypi kachkan.
I don't think I'm going to do that	Manam chayta ruwanaypaqqa piensanichu
It’s good to be here.	Allinmi kaypi kayqa.
I still can't talk about it	Kunankamapas manam chaymanta rimayta atinichu
But maybe that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
He’s going to be worse.	Payqa aswan mana allinmi kanqa.
I was a good guy.	Allin runam karqani.
Beautiful afternoon.	Sumaq tarde.
But I couldn’t believe it	Ichaqa manan creeyta atirqanichu
It would be nice if you didn’t want to say why.	Allinmi kanman mana imarayku niyta munaspaqa.
That is certainly the case.	Chayqa segurom kachkan.
I'm still not sure why	Kunankamapas manam segurochu kani imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
I don’t want to be here anymore	Manañam kayta munanichu
I don’t know anymore.	Manañam yachanichu.
I didn't know it before	Ñawpaqtaqa manam yacharqanichu
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
I still wasn’t too sure	Hinallam mana ancha segurochu karqani
I knew it wasn't	Yacharqanim mana chayna kasqanmanta
I can’t seem to help it	Manapaschá yanapayta atiymanchu hina
He wants to go with you.	Qanwan riyta munan.
It was something.	Imapas kasqa.
Maybe it would be very useful.	Ichapas ancha allin kanman.
He is very lonely.	Payqa ancha sapallanmi.
But it was really hard.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sasa karqan.
He was really very.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha karqa.
Either that, or worse.	Icha chay, icha aswan mana allin.
But it was still there.	Ichaqa hinallam karqa.
He didn’t want to seem nervous.	Payqa manan mancharisqa hina kayta munarqanchu.
I’ve done that.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani.
That would certainly be a good thing.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin allin kanman.
I wish you were here with me	Munaymanmi kaypi ñoqawan kasqaykita
That was really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi karqa.
I may not be able to do that	Manapaschá chayta ruwayta atiymanchu
I have said this over and over again.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim nirqani.
I can’t say what it is	Manam niyta atiymanchu ima kasqanmanta
I am feeling much better now	Kunanqa ancha allinmi kachkani
I don’t know, really.	Manam yachanichu, chiqaptaqa.
He is a human being.	Payqa runam.
It is.	Kayqa.
I was fine, too.	Ñuqapas allinmi karqani.
I can’t tell you	Manam willayta atiymanchu
I thought it would be bad	Yuyarqanim mana allinchu kananmanta
I can't speak immediately	Manam chaylla rimayta atinichu
He thought he would be alone.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi sapallan kananta.
That and then there.	Chay chaymanta chaypi.
It’s not that bad.	Mana chayna mana allinchu.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
But I knew there was more to it than that	Ichaqa yacharqanim chaymanta aswan achka kasqanmanta
The sooner the better.	Aswan utqaylla aswan allin.
She knew he was scared.	Payqa yacharqanmi mancharisqa kashasqanmanta.
I know what this is.	Yachanim ima kayqa kasqanmanta.
He kept going.	Payqa hinallam rirqa.
Nothing is certain.	Manan imapas segurochu.
But no one knows for sure.	Ichaqa manan pipas cheqaqtachu yachan.
I can’t say why.	Manam niyta atiymanchu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
I thought that was great	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
Everything seems fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakun.
He was pretty sure it was.	Payqa allintam seguro karqa chayna kasqanmanta.
All very human.	Tukuy ancha runa.
Actually you know better.	Chiqaptaqa qamqa aswan allintam yachanki.
He was pretty sure of that.	Chaymantaqa allintam seguro karqa.
I mean, that’s what I mean.	Chayta niyta munani.
I just wasn’t sure what happened to cause it	Chaylla mana segurochu karqani imachus chayta ruwananpaq pasasqanmanta
I don’t know about that.	Manam chaymantaqa yachanichu.
I knew it probably was	Yacharqanim yaqapaschá chayna kasqanmanta
I know this is a good person	Yachanim kayqa allin runa kasqanmanta
That’s not going to be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
He was a human being.	Payqa runam karqa.
I didn’t want him to be alone	Manam munarqanichu sapallan kananta
The man who.	Chay runa.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
I think you have to do that	Chayta ruwanayki tiyan, nispa yuyani
I know the consequences	Yachanim chaymanta imakuna pasananta
That’s what he wants to do.	Chaytan payqa ruwayta munan.
I would have that tomorrow	Chaytaqa paqarinmi kanman
I just couldn’t speak	Chaylla mana rimayta atirqanichu
I knew it was going to be bad	Yacharqanim mana allin kananta
I don’t know if it’s going to be tonight.	Mana yachanichu kunan tuta kananta.
I think that’s what I want	Yuyaykuni chay munasqayta
That’s the kind of thing.	Chayna kaq.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.

I didn’t see anyone	Manam pitapas rikurqanichu
I really should have done that	Chiqaptam chayta ruwanay karqa
Yes, everything was fine.	Arí, tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
He always knows.	Payqa sapa kutim yachan.
He was, you know.	Payqa karqan, yachanki.
He’s very good about it.	Payqa ancha allinmi chaymanta.
This is a very bad thing.	Kayqa ancha mana allinmi.
I didn’t know there was someone else here	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi huk runa kasqanmanta
He wasn’t happy being married, you know.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kasharqan casarasqa kasqanmanta, chaytan yachanki.
He didn’t know what was wrong with him.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus paywan kashasqanmanta.
I just didn’t see it	Chaylla mana rikurqanichu
Not at all.	Mana imapipas.
Everything was wonderful.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I wonder where he is	Maypi kasqanmantam tapukuni
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
I didn’t know what was in it	Manam yacharqanichu chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta
I was right, she was really nice	Allintam nirqani, payqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa
Hopefully it will be okay.	Munaymanmi allin kananpaq.
I knew it, too.	Ñuqapas yacharqanim.
I always thought he was a great guy	Sapa kutim piensarqani hatun runa kananpaq
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
I know exactly where it is	Maypi kasqanmanta allinta yachani
The angry man was injured	Chay phiñasqa runa k’irisqa karqan
He said, yes, indeed.	Payqa nisqa, arí, chiqaptam.
It’s hard to do this.	Sasa kay ruway.
Maybe good, maybe bad.	Ichapas allin, ichapas mana allin.
Maybe that was too hard.	Ichapas chayqa llumpay sinchi karqa.
But if you want to.	Ichaqa sichus munanki chayqa.
Everything looks great.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
I knew that was the case.	Chaytaqa yacharqanim.
It looked good.	Allinmi rikchakurqa.
I didn’t know how to tell it	Manam yacharqanichu imayna willayta
I couldn’t believe it was real	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chiqap kasqanmanta
I am very, very happy	Ancha, ancha kusisqam kachkani
I’m not sure, but maybe.	Manam segurochu kani, ichaqa ichapas.
More on that here.	Astawan chaymanta kaypi.
He was always there alone.	Payqa sapa kutim sapallan chaypi karqa.
That was always the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim karqa.
Obviously, he agreed.	Sut’inmi, payqa arí nisqa.
I thought it would be hard for you.	Yuyarqanim sasa kanman qampaq.
It should be a good one.	Allinmi kanan.
What is.	Imataq.
I’m not here right now.	Manam kunanqa kaypichu kachkani.
It makes the job better.	Llamk’ayta aswan allinta ruwan.
I do know that though	Chaytaqa yachanim ichaqa
I really wanted to do that	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwayta munarqani
Now I know it's wrong.	Kunanqa yachanim mana allin kasqanmanta.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
But I didn’t think it would be like tonight	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu kunan tuta hina kananta
I'm not sure what's wrong.	Manam segurochu kani ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I want it to be quick	Utqaylla kananta munani
I knew it would happen one day	Yacharqanim huk punchaw chayna kananta
I didn’t know where he lived	Manam yacharqanichu maypi yachasqanmanta

No, it’s not like that.	Manan, manan chay hinachu.
All so fast.	Tukuy chayna utqaylla.

The sooner the better, really.	Aswan utqaylla aswan allin, chiqap.
I want to know what it is	Ima kasqanmanta yachayta munani
Then sometimes.	Chaymanta wakin kuti.
Really nice performance	Chiqap sumaq ruway
I didn’t think much of this before	Ñawpaqtaqa manan anchatachu kaypi yuyaykurqani
But he didn’t want to do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta munarqanchu.
He really wanted to work.	Payqa anchatam llamkayta munarqa.
Maybe you’ll do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanki.
I'll be fine	Allinmi kasaq
I wish I could go there soon.	Munaymanmi chayman riyta chaylla.
I know exactly where it is	Allintam yachani maypi kasqanmanta
I didn’t mean to say	Manam niyta munarqanichu
I didn’t think it would work	Manam piensarqanichu allin kananta
I didn’t know that was the case	Manam yacharqanichu chayna kasqanmanta
I know this is wrong.	Yachanim kayqa mana allin kasqanmanta.
Maybe as many as ten.	Ichapas chunka hina.
I'm a beautiful person.	Sumaqmi kani.
I had no idea you were married to him	Manam yuyaykurqanichu paywan casarasqa kasqaykita
I want to talk about this	Kaymanta rimayta munani
I’ve never seen that before.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas rikurqanichu.
I know everything will be fine	Yachanim tukuy imapas allin kananta
I seriously doubt he will	Sinchitan iskayrayani chayta ruwananta
I wasn’t sure at first.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan segurochu karqani.
He was glad he didn’t have to.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan mana ruwanan kasqanmanta.
I still couldn't figure it out	Kunankamapas manam yachayta atirqanichu
Better now.	Aswan allin kunan.
But it wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman.
I don’t want to go.	Manam riyta munanichu.
Now I did it.	Kunanqa ruwarqani.
I didn’t know anything	Manam imatapas yacharqanichu
I don’t want to talk to you.	Manam qamwan rimayta munanichu.
I knew something was seriously wrong	Yacharqanim imapas hatun mana allin kasqanmanta
It’s like it should be.	Imayna kanan hinam.
He seems to be in shock.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam kachkan.
I was sure something bad had happened	Seguro karqani imapas mana allin pasasqanmanta
Yes, that’s a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi.
The best part of it.	Aswan allin kaq.
Nothing like that here.	Mana imapas chayna kaypi.
He didn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa munarqanchu.
Otherwise, nothing is wrong.	Mana chayqa, mana imapas mana allinchu.
He didn’t know how.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imaynatachus chayta.
I think he’s worried.	Yuyaykuni llakisqa kashasqanmanta.
I didn’t want that to be as bad as it once was.	Manam munarqanichu chay huk kuti hina mana allin kananta.
You know you can’t.	Yachanki mana atisqaykita.
Great man, good man	Hatun runa, allin runa
I know what he means.	Yachanim ima niyta munasqanmanta.
I’m not too sure	Manam anchatachu seguro kani
But that is not the case now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa allinchu chayqa.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
I hope no one gets hurt	Suyachkani mana pipas k’irisqa kananta
Do the right thing.	Chayta ruway.
But it’s not here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu.
I still think positively	Kunankamapas allintam piensani
You can't work.	Manam llamkayta atiwaqchu.
He was a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam karqa.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
But I know what happened	Ichaqa yachanim imakuna pasasqanmanta
That obviously won’t work.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu kanqa.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
I mean, it was just that	Niyta munani, chaylla karqa
I’m not sure though.	Manam segurochu kani ichaqa.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I don’t want to do that.	Manam chayta ruwayta munanichu.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.
I thought it didn't matter	Manam imananpaschu kasqanmantam piensarqani
Nothing is the same as before.	Mana imapas ñawpaq hinachu.
I wanted to talk to him	Paywan rimayta munarqani
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
Such a nice guy.	Chayna sumaq runa.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
I know how hard it is	Yachanim imayna sinchi sasa kasqanmanta
Actually, it doesn’t.	Chiqaptaqa, manam.
He doesn’t know exactly where he is.	Payqa manan allintachu yachan maypi kashasqanmanta.
I didn't think much of this	Kaypiqa manam anchatachu piensarqani
I didn’t think you would actually do it	Manam piensarqanichu chiqaptapuni ruwanaykita
To make it better.	Aswan allin kananpaq.
You know, how do you do that? 	Yachanki, ¿imaynatataq chayta ruwanki?
Not sure why though.	Mana segurochu imarayku ichaqa.
It doesn't matter here.	Kaypiqa manam imananpaschu.
He says no, everything is fine.	Payqa manan, tukuy imapas allinmi nin.
I want something.	Imatapas munani.
The truth of the matter.	Chiqap kaq.
But no, he wanted to play with me.	Ichaqa manam, ñuqawan pukllayta munarqa.
I don’t know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa.
He continued to go.	Hinallam rirqa.
I don't know what's worse	Manam yachanichu ima aswan mana allin kasqanmantaqa
I hope to be there more often	Suyachkani aswan sapa kuti chaypi kayta
You can’t do that now.	Kunanqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I know better than I do.	Aswan allintam yachani.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
I hope today was better	Suyachkani kunan punchaw aswan allin kasqanmanta
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
It’s just something .	Chayqa imapas chaylla .
Everything is as it should be.	Tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam kachkan.
He knows he’s doing the right thing.	Payqa yachanmi allin ruwasqanmanta.
I want to know if it’s right or not.	Allinchu icha manachu chayta yachayta munani.
He was very nice to her.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi paywan karqa.
You want her to be happy.	Munanki kusisqa kananta.
I couldn’t do anything about it	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu
Okay, maybe every week.	Allinmi, ichapas sapa semana.
I couldn’t talk to him	Manam paywan rimayta atirqanichu
I want to make sure it's good	Allin kasqanmantam seguro kayta munani
I didn’t want to come here	Manam kayman hamuyta munarqanichu
That’s what you had to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki karqan.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
What is.	Imataq.
He can’t overcome that.	Mana chayta atipayta atinchu.
I think that’s what you want	Yuyaykuni chaynata munasqaykita
Is that right?.	¿Allinchu chay?.
He is such a wonderful person.	Payqa chhayna sumaq runan.
That was a very bad thing.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi karqa.
There was a man.	Huk runam karqa.
I'm not that happy about it	Manam chayna kusisqachu kani chaymantaqa
Here’s what I mean.	Kaypi niyta munani.
He was very frightened.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa kasqa.
This is never easy.	Kayqa manam haykapipas facilchu.
That’s probably a good thing	Chayqa yaqapaschá allin kasqanmanta
You don’t know if you don’t.	Mana yachankichu icha manachu chayta.
I knew they were scared	Yacharqanim mancharisqa kasqankuta
I am sure of that.	Chaymantaqa segurom kachkani.
It’s not like that.	Manan hinachu.
Then a week later.	Chaymanta huk semana.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
I doubt what the truth is	Iskayrayani ima chiqap kasqanmanta
I still wonder why he didn't	Hinallam tapukuni imanasqataq mana chayna ruwasqanmanta
He makes it about being here.	Payqa kaypi kasqanmantam ruwan.
About a year.	Yaqa huk wata.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
That’s the kind of thing.	Chayna kaq.
This looks very interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
Be happy when you’re alone.	Sapallan kaspa kusisqa kay.
Twice that much.	Iskay kuti chay achka.
If that happens again.	Sichus hukmanta chhayna kanman chayqa.
I actually had no idea he was here	Chiqaptaqa manam piensarqanichu kaypi kasqanmanta
I can’t be sure about that	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu kayman
He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqa kasqa.
But he was right.	Ichaqa allintan chaytaqa nirqan.
I want to make sure it's good	Allin kasqanmantam seguro kayta munani
He doesn’t have to do it alone.	Manam sapallanchu chaytaqa ruwanan.
Now he wasn’t so sure.	Kunanqa manan chay hina segurochu kasqa.
You are or you are not.	Qamqa kanki icha mana.
Which is the truth.	Imataq chiqap kaq.
Alright.	Allinmi.
That doesn’t matter now.	Chayqa manan kunanqa imananpaschu.
I still really worry about that.	Chaymantaqa kunankamapas chiqaptam llakikuni.
Maybe you’ll do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanki.
But he didn’t know.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu.
Now he wasn’t so sure.	Kunanqa manan chay hina segurochu kasqa.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
No one could ever be the first.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas ñawpaq kaq kayta atinmanchu karqan.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
I didn't think it would happen	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kananta
I had no idea how long it would last	Manam yuyaykurqanichu hayka tiempo chayna kananta
He knows that.	Chaytaqa yachanmi.
I knew he was happy	Yacharqanim kusisqa kasqanmanta
I think that is wrong	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam piensani
What did he do.	Imatataq ruwarqa.
Everything, then.	Tukuy, chaymanta.
Nothing had gone wrong yet.	Manaraqmi imapas mana allinchu karqa.
He doesn’t seem overly concerned.	Payqa manan llumpay llakisqa hinachu.
I plan to find out what that is	Chayqa ima kasqanmanta yachayta yuyaykuni
I know what happened	Yachanim imapas pasasqanmanta
I was busy this morning too	Ñuqapas kunan paqarinmi ocupasqa karqani
I can’t believe you do that every night	Mana creeyta atiymanchu sapa tuta chayta ruwasqaykita
I knew he would	Yacharqanim chayta ruwananta
But that wasn’t really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chayqa karqan.
I knew what was going on	Yacharqanim imakuna pasasqanmanta
I know what works for you	Yachanim imakuna qampaq allin kasqanmanta
I’m glad he did	Kusikuni chay ruwasqanmanta
I wonder where he was last night	Qayna tuta maypi kasqanmanta tapukuni
I think you can deal with this	Kayta atipayta atisqaykita yuyani
You are so much of it.	Qamqa anchatam chaymantaqa kanki.
That’s what he does best.	Chaytan payqa aswan allinta ruwan.
I couldn’t cope anymore	Manañam atipayta atirqanichu
I did pretty well.	Allin allintam ruwarqani.
I think someone did something to him.	Yuyaykuni pipas paywan imatapas ruwasqanmanta.
I was so nervous, nervous and excited	Ancha mancharisqa, mancharisqa, kusisqa ima karqani
It doesn’t mean it’s good.	Manam niyta munanchu allin kasqanmantaqa.
A nice feature	Huk sumaq ruway
I can’t do it.	Manam atiymanchu.
I know what happened there	Yachanim chaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta
It didn’t go very well.	Manam ancha allintachu rirqa.
Actually, there is nothing.	Chiqaptaqa, manam imapas kanchu.
But that wouldn’t be the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu kanman.
I just don’t know what to say.	Chaylla mana yachanichu ima niyta.
I’m afraid that’s not the case	Manchakuni mana chayna kasqanmanta
I don’t want that to happen to you	Manam munanichu qamwan chayna pasananta
It’s not that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu.
I was just, you know	Ñuqaqa karqani chaylla, yachanki
I was really busy	Chiqaptam ocupasqa karqani
I hope it won't be too late	Suyachkani mana ancha tarde kananta
But he could never do that.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
I think he wants to talk to you	Yuyaykuni qanwan rimayta munasqanmanta
I know, right?	Yachanim, ¿aw.
It doesn’t seem right.	Manam allinchu rikchakun.
He knows how to do it.	Payqa yachanmi imaynatachus chayta.
He really is something.	Payqa chiqaptam imapas.
I didn’t want to tell you	Manam willayta munarqanichu
But he could not speak.	Ichaqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
I hope, you are very happy here.	Suyachkani, kaypi ancha kusisqa kasqaykita.
That’s probably what you need to do.	Chayqa yaqapaschá ruwanayki kanqa.
But he's still not sure what's wrong with that.	Ichaqa kunankamapas manan segurochu kashan imachus chaymanta mana allin kasqanmanta.
Like late at night.	Tuta tarde hina.
I can’t say it.	Manam niyta atiymanchu.
A lot of time	Ancha achka tiempo
I know this now.	Kaytaqa kunanmi yachani.
They will be the best.	Paykunaqa aswan allinmi kanqa.
He can’t play anymore.	Manañam pukllayta atinchu.
I know how to deal with this	Kayta imayna atipayta yachani
This approach is good on its own	Kay ruwayqa sapallanmi allin
Everything was there.	Tukuy imapas chaypi kasqa.
I had no idea what happened	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imakuna pasasqanmanta
He never wanted to talk to me.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas ñoqawan rimayta munarqanchu.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
you think.	yuyanki.
It's not.	Manachu.
But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.
I know it's not true	Yachanim mana chiqap kasqanmanta
That still seems a little unrealistic.	Chayqa kunankamapas huk chikan mana chiqap hinam kachkan.
I knew this would happen.	Yacharqanim kay pasananta.
He wasn’t up to it.	Payqa manan chayman hinachu kasharqan.
Maybe too much.	Ichapas llumpayta.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
I cannot say that now	Kunanqa manam chaytaqa niyta atiymanchu
I want to go there too	Ñuqapas chayman riyta munani
I always wanted to know more	Sapa kutim astawan yachayta munarqani
I mean, no one is here	Niyta munani, manam pipas kaypichu kachkan
I really wanted to go with him	Cheqaqtapunin paywan riyta munarqani
But I don’t know.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu.
I never knew why	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
But I didn’t want that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa munarqanichu
I know this is going to be hard but do this	Yachanim kayqa sasa kanqa ichaqa kayta ruway
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
That is not the case here.	Chayqa manam kaypichu kachkan.
It didn’t go well.	Manam allintachu rirqa.
He knew it was wrong.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana allin kasqanmanta.
I know what he's going to do	Yachanim ima ruwananta
But then, you can never tell.	Ichaqa chaymanta, mana hayk’aqpas willayta atiwaqchu.
I knew he thought about it	Yacharqanim chaypi piensasqanmanta
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
You just have to do it.	Chaylla ruwanayki tiyan.
I know they are there	Yachanim chaypi kasqankuta
No, no, no, no.	Mana, mana, mana.
I didn't do that very well	Chaytaqa manam ancha allintachu ruwarqani
It wasn’t supposed to be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan karqan.
I didn’t see anything or anyone	Manam imatapas nitaq pitapas rikurqanichu
No, they are not good.	Manan, manan allinchu kanku.
It may not be yours.	Manapaschá qanpa hinachu kanman.
He was a little something.	Payqa huk chikan imapas kasqa.
There's not much anyone can do about it.	Manam anchatachu pipas chaymantaqa ruwayta atinman.
I didn’t do well, not really	Manam allintachu ruwarqani, manam chiqaptachu
I don’t know exactly	Manam allintachu yachani
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
He knew they were gone but he didn't know where they were.	Payqa yacharqanmi manaña kasqankuta ichaqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kasqankuta.
I know they are there	Yachanim chaypi kasqankuta
He didn't want her to do this.	Payqa manan munarqanchu kayta ruwananta.
I don’t want to know	Manam yachayta munanichu
That’s what he did right.	Chaytan allinta ruwarqan.
That may not be easy.	Chayqa manapaschá facilchu kanman.
I wonder how you found out about it	Tapukuni imaynatataq chaymanta yacharqanki
Now maybe a little busy.	Kunanqa ichapas huk chhikanta ocupasqa kanman.
Not.	Mana.
I know you did tonight.	Yachanim kunan tuta ruwasqaykita.
I hope it will be.	Suyachkani chayna kananta.
He knows I want him.	Payqa yachanmi munasqayta.

I didn’t know what it was going to be like	Manam yacharqanichu imayna kananta
I never knew what it was like.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
Anything more.	Imapas aswan.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqan.
I know they are.	Yachanim kasqankuta.
But I knew it wasn't	Ichaqa yacharqanim mana chayna kasqanmanta
I can’t do this	Kaytaqa manam ruwayta atiymanchu
Before.	Ñawpaq.
I thought it was good	Allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
Where was it located.	Maypitaq kasqa.
Maybe that’s the right thing to do.	Ichapas chayna allin kanman.
I think about that a lot	Chaymantaqa anchatam piensani
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
No one knows everything.	Manan pipas tukuy imamanta yachanchu.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
But no one seemed offended.	Ichaqa manan pipas phiñasqa hinachu karqan.
I mean, like never before	Niyta munani, mana hayk’aqpas hina
It doesn’t matter that	Chaytaqa manam imananpaschu
I still want that.	Chaytaqa hinallam munani.
I want to be here faster	Aswan utqaylla kaypi munani
Maybe he was there.	Ichapas chaypi karqa.
But it just seemed too hard.	Ichaqa llumpay sinchi hinallam rikchakurqa.
I didn’t know he was in town	Manam yacharqanichu llaqtapi kasqanmantaqa
I'm asking.	Tapukuni.
Now he is almost always there	Kunanqa yaqa sapa kutim chaypi kachkan
He was a really good guy.	Payqa chiqaptam allin runa karqa.
That’s it now.	Chayqa kunanqa.
But of course you do.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwanki.
He was right!.	¡Allintam nirqa!.
You’re not going to be happy.	Manam kusisqachu kanki.
I know you’re tired	Yachanim sayk’usqa kasqaykita
I was terrified of everything	Tukuy imamanta mancharisqa karqani
I don't worry too much.	Manam anchatachu llakikuni.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
I knew that was the case	Yacharqanim chayna kasqanmanta
I would have loved more coffee	Aswan kukata anchata munani karqan
It’s just so hard so hard so hard.	Chaylla ancha sinchi ancha sinchi ancha sinchi.
That’s about it.	Chayqa chaymanta.
I know exactly what it is like	Allintam yachani imayna kasqanmanta
I can’t help it again	Manan hukmanta yanapayta atiymanchu
I knew it was a big deal	Yacharqanim hatun ruway kasqanmanta
He didn’t want this.	Payqa manan kayta munarqanchu.
It was a wonderful time.	Chay tiempopiqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Maybe he didn’t really want to.	Ichapas mana chiqaptachu munarqa.
That’s pretty tough.	Chayqa ancha sinchi.
I would love to talk to you	Munaymanmi qanwan rimayta
It was a beautiful day.	Sumaq punchawmi karqa.

I really wish he wouldn't	Chiqaptam munani mana chayta ruwananta
I can’t do the talking	Manam rimayta ruwayta atiymanchu
He had to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I have to do it right	Allintam ruwanay
I don't know what's wrong	Manam yachanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta
We are not sure.	Manam segurochu kanchik.

Do it every day.	Sapa punchaw ruway.
Here’s another one.	Kaypi huk kaq.
I don’t know what to say.	Manam yachanichu ima niyta.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
I was scared and worried	Ñuqaqa mancharisqa, llakisqa ima karqani
He really wanted to talk.	Payqa chiqaptam rimayta munarqa.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi karqa.
I don’t think anything of it	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa piensanichu
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa.
They are very beautiful.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi kanku.
I couldn’t do it anymore	Manañan ruwayta atirqanichu
He said everything was going to be fine.	Payqa tukuy imapas allinmi kananta nirqa.
I can’t do it.	Manam ruwayta atiymanchu.
I never thought of that	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanichu
That’s what he knows.	Chayta payqa yachan.
I was okay with it.	Allinmi karqani.
Now he doesn't care about anything.	Kunanqa manam imamantapas imananpaschu.
I had to do it right	Allintam ruwanay karqa
I was here today.	Kunan punchawmi kaypi karqani.
I didn’t know that was the case	Manam yacharqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa
He had to be sure.	Payqa seguro kanan karqan.
It wouldn’t be the first time.	Manam ñawpaq kutichu kanman.

He does it for many days.	Achka punchawmi ruwan.
I can’t talk about it yet	Manaraqmi chaymanta rimayta atiymanchu
The most difficult task.	Aswan sasa ruway.
He knows better.	Aswan allintam yachan.
I didn't know that, actually	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu, chiqaptaqa
What’s not.	Imataq mana.

I want it so much.	Anchatam munani.
I don’t want to know.	Manam yachayta munanichu.
Nothing whatsoever for you.	Mana imapas qampaq imapas.
But, of course it’s not.	Ichaqa, sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
Difficult to tell.	Sasa willay.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.

It was beautiful at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa sumaqmi karqa.
Obviously this wasn’t the first time.	Sut’inmi kayqa manan ñawpaq kutichu karqan.
I wonder if anyone knows of such a thing	Tapukunitaqmi sichus pipas yachan chayna kasqanmanta
That’s what he did.	Chaytan payqa ruwarqan.
I just didn’t see it.	Chaylla mana rikurqanichu.
I’m sure he didn’t.	Seguro kani mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Nothing too bad.	Mana imapas ancha mana allinchu.
Twenty weeks with him, twenty weeks without him.	Iskay chunka semana paywan, iskay chunka semana mana paywan.
I never thought of that!.	¡Manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu!.
I know what he can do	Yachanim ima ruway atisqanmanta

In fact, everything was fine.	Chiqaptaqa, tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
He didn’t know what was wrong.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus mana allin kashasqanmanta.
But he knew that would not be the case.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kananta.
I always wonder what happened to him	Sapa kutim tapukuni imakuna paywan pasasqanmanta
It’s okay with me.	Allinmi ñuqawan.
Why are you so good.	¿Imanasqataq ancha allin kanki.
I probably did the same thing	Ñuqapas yaqapaschá chaynata ruwarqani
He is a	Payqa .

Maybe you’ll succeed, maybe you won’t.	Ichapas allinta ruwanki, ichapas mana.

I know exactly what he can do.	Allintam yachani ima ruway atisqanmanta.
I wanted to talk to you about something	Imamantapas qanwan rimayta munarqani
I want that to be true.	Chaytaqa munani.
I wasn’t sure.	Manam segurochu karqani.
I had no idea he was there	Manam piensarqanichu chaypi kasqanmantaqa
It seemed to do the job.	Chay llamkayta ruwaq hinam karqa.
He was something else, man.	Payqa huk imapas kasqa, runa.
What is the second.	Imataq iskay kaq.
But I am sure of it.	Ichaqa segurom kachkani.
But no, it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan, manan chay hina facilchu.
He couldn’t deal with that now.	Chaytaqa manan kunanqa atipayta atirqanchu.
I have always been with him	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi paywan kuska kani

But no one knows that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa yachanchu.
He did it right.	Allintam ruwarqa.
It’s just not that easy.	Chaylla mana chayna facilchu.
Who is with me?.	¿Pitaq ñuqawan kachkan?.
I know it will be great	Yachanim hatun kananmanta
I strongly think it will do well.	Sinchitan yuyaykuni allinta ruwanqa.
He's really excited.	Payqa chiqaptam kusisqa kachkan.
I can’t seem to do anything about it now	Kunanqa manapaschá imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu hina
It doesn’t mean you’re not good enough.	Manam niyta munanchu mana allinchu kasqaykita.
I’m afraid he wants to do something	Manchakuni imatapas ruwayta munasqanmanta
I couldn’t tell before	Ñawpaqtaqa manam willayta atirqanichu
He doesn’t like to get hurt.	Payqa manan gustanchu k’irisqa kayqa.
They are not good.	Mana allinchu kanku.
He says he’s hurt.	Payqa ninmi k’irisqa kasqanmanta.

It was dark.	Tuta kasqa.
I didn’t know it was going to happen	Manam yacharqanichu chayna kananta

It’s not like everything should be.	Manan tukuy imapas kanan hinachu.
He didn’t know it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu.
This he knew.	Kaytaqa payqa yacharqanmi.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi kasqa.
It was indeed the case.	Chiqaptam chayna karqa.

He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
He refused to say anything	Payqa manan imatapas rimayta munarqanchu
The day will be like the night.	Punchawqa tuta hinam kanqa.
I didn’t want this job anymore	Manañam kay llamkayta munarqanichu
I wanted to know more about it.	Chaymanta astawan yachayta munarqani.
He was a happy man.	Payqa kusisqa runam karqa.
Certainly not.	Cheqaqtapunin mana.
Something is better than nothing.	Imapas aswan allinmi mana imamantapas.

I have never been so happy.	Manam haykapipas chayna kusisqachu karqani.
They don’t care.	Paykunaqa manan imananpaschu.

But something else.	Ichaqa imapas.
It doesn’t matter if you do that.	Chayta ruwayqa manan imananpaschu.
I don't know what to do.	Manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
I didn’t do that right	Chaytaqa manam allintachu ruwarqani
I want to know what makes it	Imataq ruwan chayta yachayta munani
But he could not speak.	Ichaqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munanichu.
I knew it was true	Yacharqanim chiqap kasqanmanta
I know it’s going to go wrong	Yachanim mana allin pasananta
I couldn’t tell him anything	Manam imatapas willayta atirqanichu
I really wanted him to be there	Chiqaptam munarqani chaypi kananta
I wasn’t sure of anything	Manam imamantapas segurochu karqani
But, though.	Ichaqa, ichaqa.
I want to know what they are like	Imayna kasqankuta yachayta munani
He realized why.	Payqa repararqanmi imarayku chayta.

Everything will happen.	Tukuy imapas kanqa.

I mean no, he doesn't	Niyta munani manam, payqa manam

He didn’t want me here.	Payqa manan kaypichu munarqani.
I didn't think it would be so fast	Manam piensarqanichu chayna utqaylla kananta
I thought to myself.	nispaymi yuyaykurqani.
I know what he can do	Yachanim ima ruway atisqanmanta
He was really tired.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin sayk’usqa kasharqan.
I did a very good job	Ancha allintam ruwarqani
All too often.	Tukuy ancha achka kuti.
But that would never work.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chayqa allinchu kanman.
But it’s not easy at all	Ichaqa manan imapipas facilchu

But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.

He couldn’t tell how many there were.	Payqa manan yachayta atirqanchu hayk’a kasqankuta.
I’m afraid of what’s going to happen	Manchakuni imakuna pasananta
I just know what happened	Chaylla yachani imapas pasasqanmanta
I knew he wanted it	Yacharqanim chayta munasqanmanta
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
I couldn’t talk to him anymore	Manañam paywan rimayta atirqanichu
He didn’t want her to get hurt.	Payqa manan munarqanchu k’irisqa kananta.

Yes, yes, yes.	Arí, arí, arí.
I didn’t know he was in this city	Manam yacharqanichu kay llaqtapi kasqanmanta
I didn't mean that, not really	Manam chaytaqa niyta munarqanichu, manam chiqaptachu
I knew something like that was going to happen	Yacharqanim chayna imapas kananmanta
Like today.	Kunan hina.
I thought that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani
I never thought it would be that bad	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna mana allin kasqanmantaqa
He looked very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam rikchakurqa.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
He's doing really well.	Payqa chiqap allintam ruwachkan.
I knew it would be soon	Yacharqanim chaylla kananta
But what was it like.	Ichaqa imaynataq kasqa.
I thought it was great.	Ñuqaqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
This doesn't seem right.	Kayqa manam allinchu rikchakun.
I knew it would be good	Yacharqanim allin kananta
That, however, was not the case	Chayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan
It was a very nice experience	Ancha sumaqmi karqan
I didn’t want to know that	Manam chayta yachayta munarqanichu
A few days after that	Iskay kimsa punchaw chaymanta
Nothing is unique here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas sapallanchu.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
I couldn’t talk to him	Manam paywan rimayta atirqanichu
That really did it.	Chayqa chiqaptam ruwarqa.
I didn’t want to be there at first	Ñawpaqtaqa manan chaypi kayta munarqanichu

Yes, it’s beautiful.	Arí, sumaqmi.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
You can never be sure.	Manan hayk’aqpas seguro kayta atiwaqchu.
I wonder what it is about me that causes it	Tapukuni imataq ñuqamanta chayta ruwan
I’m not going to be good	Manam allinchu kasaq

I don’t care how good it is.	Manam imananpaschu imayna allin kasqanmantaqa.
I couldn’t say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta atirqanichu.

He’s better now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan allinmi.
I really don't know anything about anything.	Chiqaptaqa manam imamantapas imatapas yachanichu.

I can’t say anything	Manam imata niyta atiymanchu

I mean, they’re there.	Niyta munani, chaypi kachkanku.

This is so good this thing!.	¡Kayqa ancha allinmi kay imapas!.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
Not bad really.	Mana mana allinchu chiqap.
He doesn’t know.	Manam yachanchu.

Very good.	Aswan allinmi.
No one really knows.	Manam pipas chiqaptaqa yachanchu.
I can't be hurt	Manam k'irisqa kayta atiymanchu
But I don’t think he could do that	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu, nispaymi yuyaykuni
You know what day it is.	Yachanki ima punchawmi chay punchaw kasqanmanta.
Maybe someone was there.	Ichapas pipas chaypi karqa.
I didn't think it would happen.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kananta.
It takes a lot of it.	Achkatam necesitan.
He seemed fine.	Payqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
But it’s beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi.
Nothing was right.	Manam imapas allinchu karqa.
Clearly, he could never do that	Sut’inmi kashan mana hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atisqanmanta
I didn’t think it was that good	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chayna allin kasqanmantaqa
I couldn’t do anything about it	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu
He was a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam karqa.
No, it’s okay.	Manan, allinmi.
Which is uncertain.	Imataq mana segurochu.
He had to do what he said he would do.	Nisqanman hinam ruwanan karqa.
I think that is true	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani
This one time.	Kay huk kuti.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
This, he said.	Kayta, nispa.
I wonder if anyone was there	Pipas chaypi kasqanmantam tapukuni
The process was a great success.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
I would love some help.	Anchatan munani wakin yanapayta.
Yes, that’s a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
I knew it was going to be bad	Yacharqanim mana allin kananta
I didn’t think this would happen	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kay pasananta
He wasn’t like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Always a bad thing to do.	Sapa kuti mana allin ruway.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
What are you going to do? 	¿Imatan ruwanki?
I haven’t seen it yet	Manaraqmi rikurqanichu
I would not have done this	Kaytaqa manam ruwaymanchu karqa
Otherwise, otherwise, otherwise.	Mana chayqa, mana chayqa, mana chayqa.
I know exactly where it is	Maypi kasqanmanta allinta yachani
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
He can do that.	Payqa chayta ruwanman.
You don't know if it's there.	Chaypi kasqanmantaqa manam yachankichu.
He knew he would be there.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaypi kananta.
He knows how to play well.	Payqa allintam pukllayta yachan.
He’s doing well.	Payqa allinmi kachkan.
But it was a very long time ago.	Ichaqa ancha unayñan karqan.
I didn't think of that	Chaytaqa manam piensarqanichu
He was a very tough guy	Payqa ancha sinchi runam karqa
I want this one.	Kayta munani.
I would never do that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
I want to talk about it again	Hukmanta rimayta munani
I didn’t know anything about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqanichu.
Everything, I want more to come	Tukuy ima, aswan achka hamunanta munani
But that’s not the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa allinchu.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I'm pretty good.	Allin allinmi kani.
He doesn’t know why.	Payqa manan yachanchu imarayku.
I wanted so badly to believe he was tired	Anchatam creeyta munarqani sayk’usqa kasqanpi
I think that's what it is	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani
I knew something bad was going to happen	Yacharqanim imapas mana allin pasananta
It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
What’s that.	Imataq chayta.
That means if you want to be better.	Chayta niyta munan sichus aswan allin kayta munanki chayqa.
Which is great.	Imataq hatun.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
I never wanted to be like that.	Manam haykapipas chayna kaytaqa munarqanichu.
After all, nothing was certain.	Tukuy imamanta, mana imapas segurochu karqa.
But that’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu.
This was probably the first failure.	Kayqa yaqapaschá ñawpaq kaq mana allin ruway karqa.
I thought it was great	Ñuqaqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensarqani
That is the best way to do it.	Chay ruwayqa aswan allinmi.
I had to do some	Wakin ruwanay karqan
But I never knew what it was	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanichu imachus kasqanmanta
That’s what he has to do.	Chaytan ruwanan.
I didn’t want money.	Manam qullqita munarqanichu.
Maybe that’s it.	Ichapas chay.
I would never do that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
I didn’t know that before	Chaytaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa yacharqanichu
I couldn't believe it	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atirqanichu
But it wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman chayqa.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
I want to know what he’s doing	Ima ruwasqanmanta yachayta munani
It was just as he had said.	Nisqanman hinam karqa.
I can’t seem to help it	Manapaschá yanapayta atiymanchu hina
I still don't know for sure.	Kunankamapas manam allintachu yachani.

Actually, do ten of that.	Chiqaptaqa, chayta chunka ruway.
No, that’s not a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu.
I want to know more.	Astawan yachayta munani.

That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I knew something was going to happen	Yacharqanim imapas pasananta
I used to be uncomfortable.	Ñawpaqtaqa manañam allinchu karqani.
Every person.	Sapa runa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I think that's something I should do too	Chayqa ñuqapas ruwanay kasqanmantam piensani
He wasn’t happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu karqan.
I thought it was going to happen	Yuyarqanim chayna kananmanta
That was certainly the case.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
Two good, yeah, yeah.	Iskay allin, arí, arí.
I don’t know that you can do that.	Mana yachanichu chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.

I knew something was wrong now	Yacharqanim kunan imapas mana allin kasqanmanta
I’ll do that as soon as possible.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan ruwasaq.
He knew he didn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
There isn’t.	Mana kanchu.

I didn’t know it was coming.	Manam yacharqanichu hamunanta.

He is doing a good job.	Payqa allintam ruwachkan.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.
He doesn’t know what that might be.	Payqa manan yachanchu imachus chay kanman chayta.
No one can do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
I know you did something with him	Yachanim paywan imatapas ruwasqaykita
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
He didn't look happy.	Payqa manam kusisqachu rikchakurqa.
He is a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I certainly did that.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqani.
He can’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
I’m sure he’ll do well.	Seguro kani allinta ruwananmanta.
He must act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan.
But that was not the case here.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan kaypiqa.
Maybe you’re the one.	Ichapas qamqa kanki.
I can't do it now	Kunanqa manam atiymanchu
It’s really, really good.	Chiqap, chiqap allinmi.
However, that is not yet the case.	Ichaqa, chayqa manaraqmi kanchu.
I'm going to go, he said.	Risaq, nispa.
I think that’s what he meant	Chaytan niyta munarqan, nispan yuyaykuni

You’re going to be very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kanki.
It was supposed to be good.	Allinmi kanan karqa.

That’s what it means.	Chayqa niyta munan.
Maybe it was that good.	Ichapas chayna allin karqa.

You know that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi yachanki.

I don’t know that.	Manam chaytaqa yachanichu.
He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
I doubt it happened that night	Iskayrayani chay tuta pasasqanmanta
I could never say that	Manam haykapipas chayta niyta atirqanichu
That was it.	Chayqa karqa.
No one can tell you this.	Kaytaqa manam pipas willayta atinmanchu.
I want to be with you longer	Aswan unayta qanwan kayta munani
Otherwise, it’s great.	Mana chayqa, ancha allinmi.

I wonder who the newcomer might be.	Tapukuni pitaq kanman chay musuq hamuq.

However, it is not a good thing.	Ichaqa, manan allinchu.

This is certainly a good thing.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa allin.

I just couldn’t believe it.	Chaylla mana creeyta atirqanichu.
Happily not.	Kusisqam mana.
I didn’t see it.	Manam rikurqanichu.
I had no idea what would happen next.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chaymanta imakuna kananmanta.
I know very well what it is like.	Ancha allintam yachani imayna kasqanmanta.
No, no, not really.	Manan, manan, cheqaqtachu.
That’s a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi.

But I can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwayta atiymanchu.
I am very sorry to say	Anchatam llakikuni niyta
He was not alone here.	Kaypiqa manam sapallanchu karqa.

I overdid everything	Tukuy imatam llumpayta ruwarqani
But he doesn't know anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas yachanchu.
He doesn’t like it.	Payqa manam gustanchu.
I can’t be that person	Manam chay runa kayta atiymanchu
I mean he did well	Allintam ruwasqanmanta niyta munani
I mean, how was he	Niyta munani, imaynataq payqa karqa
Everything seemed fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa.

I know it was there	Yachanim chaypi kasqanmanta
That was the angry thing.	Chayqa phiñasqa kasqa.
They are so good together.	Chayna allintam kuska kachkanku.

I think he is a good man	Allin runa kasqanmantam piensani

He didn't know what it was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to play anymore.	Manañam pukllayta munarqanichu.

You want to know.	Yachayta munanki.
I am very sorry about that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni.

This was the case.	Kayqa karqan.
But now he can’t.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan atinchu.
But that’s what he said.	Ichaqa chaytan nirqan.
He was quite the man.	Payqa allintam chay runa karqa.
He is a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi.
I can’t say what it is.	Manam niyta atiymanchu ima kasqanmantaqa.
But that’s pretty much it.	Ichaqa chayqa yaqa hinan.
He can’t do this.	Payqa manan kayta ruwayta atinmanchu.
He was alright though.	Payqa allinmi karqan ichaqa.
He is here with us every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi kaypi ñuqaykuwan kachkan.

I am so happy for you.	Anchatam kusikuni qampaq.
I really wanted to do that	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwayta munarqani
I wish I could talk to him	Munaymanmi karqa paywan rimayta
It’s not going to get any worse than that.	Manam chaymantaqa aswan mana allinchu kanqa.
He wanted to tell her.	Payqa willayta munarqa.
I think that’s not an easy thing to do	Chay ruwayqa mana facilchu kasqanmanta yuyaykuni
I can’t do it.	Manam atiymanchu.
I was happy with you here	Kaypi qanwan kuska kusisqa karqani

This is not a good practice.	Kay ruwayqa manam allinchu.

I hope, you are very happy here	Suyachkani, kaypi ancha kusisqa kasqaykita
I think you’re doing the right thing.	Yuyaykuni allinta ruwasqaykita.
I know it won't happen though.	Yachanim ichaqa mana pasananta.

It had to be quick.	Chayqa usqhayllan kanan karqan.
No.	Manam.

Everything else.	Tukuy imakuna.
I didn’t mean to say.	Manam niyta munarqanichu.
But it isn’t.	Ichaqa manan.
I knew he wouldn't	Yacharqanim mana chayta ruwananta
I would love to know where it is	Anchatan munani maypi kasqanmanta yachayta
This seems good, but it is not good.	Kayqa allinmi rikchakun, ichaqa manam allinchu.
He was there to do the job.	Chay llamkayta ruwananpaqmi chaypi karqa.
All day long.	Tukuy punchaw.
I never knew why	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmantaqa
But it’s not the best.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
I mean, he does it all the time.	Niyta munani, payqa tukuy tiempon chayta ruwan.
You're not really that scared.	Manam chiqaptachu chayna mancharisqa kachkanki.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I wonder where that might be	Maypitaq chay kanman chayta tapukuni
But I did it right.	Ichaqa chaytaqa allintan ruwarqani.
Everything will be fine for you here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa qampaq.
I mean, nobody.	Niyta munani, mana pipas.
He said it was okay.	Payqa allinmi nisqa.
You can’t do anything about it.	Manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I didn’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yacharqanichu.
It’s like it should be.	Imayna kanan hinam.
Not very often.	Mana ancha sapa kutichu.
It won’t be here.	Manam kaypichu kanqa.
I didn’t really think this through	Kaytaqa manan allintachu yuyaykurqani
He was very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa kasqa.
But now they are very good.	Ichaqa kunanqa ancha allinmi kanku.
More on this please.	Astawan kaymanta ama hina kaspa.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
I can't do this now	Kunanqa manam kayta ruwayta atiymanchu
I still couldn't speak	Kunankamapas manam rimayta atirqanichu
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
He was in deep distress at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan.
That would have been the case.	Chayna kanman karqa.
He told her not to do it.	Mana ruwananpaq nisqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
It would be like that.	Chayna kanman.
First of all, it’s the name.	Ñawpaqtaqa, sutinmi.
I know nothing about that	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas yachanichu
That seemed to be the case.	Chayqa karqan hina.
I didn’t see anything.	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu.
Whether that will happen is nobody knows.	Chayna kanqa icha manachu chaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.

I can’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atiymanchu.
I didn’t do much.	Manam anchatachu ruwarqani.
Yes, he wanted to do that.	Arí, chayta ruwayta munarqa.
I’m so excited	Anchatan kusikuni
He didn’t do it right.	Mana allintam ruwarqa.
It’s not the way he says it is.	Manam imayna nisqanman hinachu.
I know how to play the game	Pukllayta yachani
Maybe more than one.	Ichapas hukmanta aswan achka.
With him and me.	Paywan ñuqawan.
I had no idea what had happened to him	Manam yuyaykurqanichu imakuna paywan pasasqanmanta
I certainly wasn’t happy	Cheqaqtapunin mana kusisqachu karqani
Do the right thing.	Chayta ruway.
It can be good, it can be bad.	Allinmi kanman, mana allinchu kanman.
I was a very lonely person	Ancha sapallan runam karqani
I know how it happened	Yachanim imayna pasasqanmanta
That, however, was not the case.	Chayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I thought that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He had it with him the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon chayta paywan kasharqan.
But I’m worse off	Ichaqa aswan mana allinchu kani
I don’t want to know that	Manam chayta yachayta munanichu
I can’t go to the gym.	Manam riyta atiymanchu.
I couldn’t do it anymore	Manañam ruwayta atirqanichu
Very, very happy.	Ancha, ancha kusisqa.
It couldn’t be worse.	Mana aswan mana allinchu kanman.

I want to learn another language	Huk simita yachayta munani
It’s beautiful.	Sumaqmi.

I will act like a good man	Allin runa hinam ruwasaq
Do something about it.	Imatapas ruway.
I just know that you are	Chaylla yachani chayna kasqaykita
In fact, this is not always the case.	Chiqaptaqa manam sapa kutichu chayna.
He wasn’t like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He was very nice to me.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqawan karqa.
He doesn’t know anything.	Payqa manan imatapas yachanchu.
Maybe it’s not a good thing.	Ichapas mana allinchu kanman.
What a great guy.	Ima hatun runa.
And he was angry.	Hinan payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
I didn’t really want to go there	Manam anchatachu chayman riyta munarqani
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I knew everything was going to be hard, really, really hard.	Yacharqanim tukuy imapas sasa kananta, chiqaptapuni, chiqap sasa kananta.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
But it’s not easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu.
Nothing major though.	Mana imapas hatun ichaqa.
I think that's a great thing	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensani
But I'm fine.	Ichaqa allinmi kachkani.
Fortunately, like yesterday.	Ancha kusisqa, qayna punchaw hina.
I just never thought about it, you know	Chaylla mana hayk’aqpas chaypi yuyaykurqanichu, yachanki
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.

He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.

I made the coffee.	Chay kukata ruwarqani.
It’s more intense.	Aswan sinchi.

He wasn’t going to do it any other way.	Payqa manan huk hinachu ruwanan karqan.

I hadn’t thought of that	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu
I don’t know what happened here.	Manam yachanichu kaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
Always.	Sapa kuti.
He knows better than he does.	Payqa aswan allintam yachan.
But I don’t think he will.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykunichu chayta ruwananta.
This was when.	Kayqa karqan hayk’aqmi.
I really need to do something about it.	Cheqaqtapunin chaymantaqa imatapas ruwanay.
I want to tell you something	Imatapas willayta munani

Now it’s worse.	Kunanqa aswan mana allinmi.
It would be nice to do it again.	Hukmanta ruwayqa sumaqmi kanman.
He was tired, very tired.	Sayk’usqa, ancha sayk’usqa kasqa.
I hope he does.	Suyachkani chayta ruwananta.
I never saw this coming	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu kay hamunanta
It’s not that good.	Chayna mana allinchu.
I cannot tell you how this is	Kay imayna kasqanmantaqa manam willayta atiymanchu
I did everything right.	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwarqani.
I wonder what’s wrong	Imataq mana allin kasqanmanta tapukuni
But this is really good.	Ichaqa kayqa cheqaqtapunin allin.
I didn't know what to say or do	Manañam yacharqanichu ima niyta nitaq ima ruwanayta
That was a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
I just know it’s good	Chaylla yachani allin kasqanmanta
This is not the case.	Kayqa manam.
I don’t really want to be there.	Manam chiqaptachu chaypi kayta munani.
It was a difficult day.	Sasa punchawmi karqa.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
But that wouldn’t have been the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman karqan.
I thought it probably was	Yuyarqanim yaqapaschá chayna kasqanmanta
And he said yes.	Hinan payqa arí nisqa.
Nothing, maybe.	Mana imapas, ichapas.
This means that the.	Kayqa niyta munan, chay.

That’s never a good thing.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu.

I didn’t think of anything	Manam imatapas piensarqanichu
They are like new.	Musuq hinam kanku.
I didn’t want to say anything	Manam imatapas niyta munarqanichu
I really wanted to help	Anchatam munarqani yanapayta
He wasn’t good enough.	Payqa manan allinchu karqan.
I thought that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
But it was a better time.	Ichaqa aswan allin tiempon karqan.
I doubt it very much.	Anchatam iskayrayani.
They are not like that.	Paykunaqa manan chay hinachu kanku.
There was nothing wrong with it.	Manam imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I really didn't want to talk about it	Chiqaptaqa manam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu
Yes, he really did say that.	Arí, chiqaptam chaytaqa nirqa.
I can’t do that	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
I hope you are well.	Suyachkani allin kasqaykita.
Do what you want, fine.	Munasqaykita ruway, allinmi.
No, he didn’t want to.	Manan, payqa manan munarqanchu.
There was nothing wrong with it.	Manam imapas mana allinchu karqa.
What a beautiful sight!.	¡Ima sumaqmi!.
It’s probably going to be.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanqa.
I think he was scared	Yuyaykuni mancharisqa kashasqanmanta
I knew it wasn’t going to happen	Yacharqanim mana chayna kananta
Now he does it all the time.	Kunanqa sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwan.
You really are something.	Chiqaptam imapas kanki.
Someone needs to do something with him now.	Pipas kunanmi paywan imatapas ruwanan.
I wish he was here now	Munaymanmi kunan kaypi kananta
He is happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan.
Otherwise, it’s not.	Mana chayqa, manan.
I wonder if anyone knows of such a thing.	Tapukunitaqmi sichus pipas yachan chayna kasqanmanta.
It almost never happened.	Yaqapaschá mana hayk’aqpas chay hinachu karqan.
I can’t tell you what they are like	Manam willayta atiymanchu imayna kasqankuta
He is not here now.	Payqa manan kunanqa kaypichu kashan.

I didn't know what, but nothing was right here	Manam yacharqanichu imata, ichaqa kaypiqa manam imapas allinchu karqa
I was sure that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam seguro karqani
Maybe more than one.	Ichapas hukmanta aswan achka kanman.
I didn’t want that to happen	Manam munarqanichu chayna kananta
But it’s not like this.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu.
The big difference.	Hatun chikan kay.
He is a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
Maybe he could have.	Ichapas atinman karqa.
He kept going.	Payqa hinallam rirqa.
Almost every day.	Yaqa sapa punchaw.

He’s so there though.	Payqa chayna chaypi kachkan ichaqa.
That’s for you.	Chayqa qampaq.
He couldn’t talk to her.	Payqa manan paywan rimayta atirqanchu.
I don’t really care about myself	Manam chiqaptachu ñuqamanta llakikuni
He was a good guy.	Payqa allin runam karqa.
But he wants to make sure he does.	Ichaqa chayta ruwananpaqmi seguro kayta munan.
He doesn’t like it.	Payqa manan gustanchu.
Maybe he’s happy here.	Ichapas kaypi kusisqa kachkan.
Yes, three weeks.	Arí, kimsa semana.
I thought you were safe	Ñuqaqa seguro kasqaykita piensarqani
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t	Manam atiymanchu, manam atiymanchu, manam atiymanchu

But of course it’s not.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
I'm sorry, I don't.	Pampachaykuway, manam, nispa.

It wasn’t a good thing.	Mana allinchu karqa.
He couldn't say that.	Payqa manan chayta niyta atirqanchu.

I didn’t want to do this	Manam kayta ruwayta munarqanichu
I mean, you do.	Niyta munani, qamqa ruwanki.
I can’t do that	Manan chaytaqa ruwaymanchu
I know this would be wrong	Yachanim kayqa mana allinchu kanman
It’s like there’s something.	Imapas kanman hina.
A couple of years.	Iskay kimsa wata.
I never knew it.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu.
That’s not easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu.

That’s pretty interesting, actually.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi, chiqaptaqa.

That’s how it should be.	Chayna kanan.
I really want to win	Anchatan munani atipayta
I really wanted a good time together tonight	Anchatam munarqani kunan tuta kuska allin tiempota
I didn’t know what he meant	Manam yacharqanichu ima niyta munasqanmanta
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Very well, perhaps.	Ancha allinmi, ichapas.
I wasn’t sure what would happen next	Manam segurochu karqani chaymanta imakuna pasananta
He couldn’t do anything else.	Payqa manan huk ruwayta atirqanchu.
Great, he said.	Hatun, nispa.
Otherwise, whatever.	Mana chayqa, imapas.
I don’t really know.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani.

He didn’t want that.	Chaytaqa manan munarqanchu.

That’s everything.	Chayqa tukuy imapas.
Nothing really unique.	Mana imapas chiqap sapallanchu.
Yes that’s a good thing.	Arí chayqa allinmi.

You know something.	Imatapas yachanki.
But I’m not quite sure how to do that.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachani imaynatachus chayta ruwanaypaq.
Being a human being.	Runa kay.
I thought that was great	Chayqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensarqani
No one wants that!.	¡Manan pipas chaytaqa munanchu!.
He said he didn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu nispan nisqa.
I really wanted it to fail	Anchatan munarqani mana allintachu ruwananta
I am an everyday person	Sapa punchaw runam kani
What does he know.	Imatataq yachan.
He said that over and over again.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim nirqa.
That was it.	Chayqa karqa.
I haven’t done enough yet	Manaraqmi allintachu ruwarqani
But that was a long time ago.	Ichaqa chayqa unayñan karqan.
I knew he never would.	Yacharqanim mana haykapipas ruwananta.
I know what he did	Yachanim ima ruwasqanmanta
It should be a good one.	Allinmi kanan.
I don’t want it anymore	Manañam munanichu
At this point I was quickly tired.	Kaypiqa usqhayllan sayk’usqa karqani.
I was sure it was	Seguro karqani chayna kasqanmanta
But this is.	Ichaqa kay.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I wish he wouldn’t do that.	Chayta mana ruwananta munani.
He doesn’t care, though.	Payqa manan imananpaschu, ichaqa.
I would like to talk	Munaymanmi rimayta
Now I am sorry now	Kunanqa kunanmi llakikuni
But he didn’t know that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa yacharqanchu.
This was now.	Kayqa kunanmi karqa.
I wanted to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayta munarqani.
He is alone	Payqa sapallanmi
That should certainly be the case.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin kanan.
. . . .	.
I worry about everything	Tukuy imamanta llakikuni
It’s not like it’s coming.	Mana hamuq hinachu.
He is not here now.	Kunanqa manañam kaypichu kachkan.
But it’s not here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu kashan.
I wish I knew what it was like	Munaymanmi imayna kasqanmanta yachayta
I didn't think it was very good	Manam ancha allin kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
But I could never get over it	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas atipayta atirqanichu
I don't care what it looks like.	Manam imananpaschu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
I think he didn’t want to go	Yuyaykuni mana riyta munasqanmanta
I didn’t want to not tell you	Manam mana willayta munarqanichu
I don’t know where.	Manam yachanichu maypi.
I knew you would do it again	Yacharqanim hukmanta ruwanaykita
Can't say more.	Mana astawan niyta atinchu.
Maybe he knows something.	Ichapas payqa imatapas yachan.
I mean, he wanted to know why	Niyta munani, payqa yachayta munarqan imarayku chayta
It wasn’t easy.	Manam facilchu karqa.
This is indeed the case.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa.
I was excited and nervous	Kusisqa, mancharisqa ima karqani
I was sure of that now.	Chaymantaqa kunanqa segurom karqani.
But I couldn’t do it yet	Ichaqa manaraqmi ruwayta atirqanichu
I don’t know how to say it.	Manam yachanichu imayna niyta.
But that’s what he meant.	Ichaqa chaytan niyta munarqan.
I know you want to talk	Yachanim rimayta munasqaykita
I can’t be sure.	Manam seguro kayta atiymanchu.
Man, they’re beautiful.	Runa, sumaqmi kanku.
That would have been nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman karqa.
That was supposed to be.	Chayqa kanan karqan.
I hope it goes well for you.	Suyachkani allinta qampaq rinanpaq.
He’s a really nice guy.	Payqa chiqap sumaq runam.
But I’ve never seen that before.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
I thought of the story.	Chay willayta yuyaykurqani.
I wonder how he does that	Imaynatataq chayta ruwan nispa tapukuni
I know how to play this game.	Kay pukllayta pukllayta yachani.
You can’t do it.	Manan atiwaqchu.
This is probably not a good thing.	Kayqa manachá allinchu.
It just looks like he has to do something.	Imatapas ruwanan hinallam rikchakun.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
I know that is not the case now	Yachanim kunanqa mana chayna kasqanmanta
I look forward to finding out how it is	Suyachkani imayna kasqanmanta yachayta
He shouldn't be here.	Payqa manam kaypichu kanan.
He didn’t really want to.	Payqa manan anchatachu munarqan.
He was a real person.	Payqa chiqap runam karqa.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi kasqa.
Those two things for sure.	Chay iskay imakuna seguro kasqanmanta.
But it looked nice.	Ichaqa sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
Maybe I will too.	Ichapas ñuqapas chayta ruwasaq.
I don’t care what happens to you anymore	Manañan imananpaschu imachus qanwan pasananta
It’s actually rather interesting.	Chiqaptaqa aswan sumaqmi.
I almost couldn’t believe it	Yaqapaschá mana creeyta atirqanichu
Today is not a good day.	Kunan punchaw mana allinchu.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
It says what it is.	Ima kasqanmantam nin.
I can’t do anything else	Manañam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
That’s all, really.	Chaylla, chiqap.
It means well to you, very well, that kind of thing.	Allintam niyta munan qampaq, ancha allinmi, chayna kaq.
I don't want to believe this	Kaytaqa manam creeyta munanichu
He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam karqa.
I never knew it would happen this fast	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu kay utqaylla pasananta
It seemed like no one else did.	Mana pipas chayta ruwaq hinam karqa.
I never wanted to be like that	Manam haykapipas chayna kaytaqa munarqanichu
He was scared, this.	Payqa mancharisqa kasqa, kayqa.
That’s the one.	Chayqa chay.
I meant to say.	Niyta munarqani.
I never thought of that	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa piensarqanichu
That could have been anything.	Chayqa imapas kanman karqa.
I don’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munanichu.
It’s not like that.	Mana hinachu.
But it doesn't matter now.	Ama kunanqa imananpaschu.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I haven’t seen this before.	Manaraq kayta rikurqanichu.
That’s all, please.	Chaylla, ama hina kaspa.
He could be here now.	Payqa kunan kaypi kanman.
I don’t want to do that again	Manam hukmanta chayta ruwayta munanichu
He knew what he was going to do.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwananta.
I want to believe that.	Chaytaqa creeyta munani.
I didn’t want to know.	Manam yachayta munarqanichu.
I can’t say anymore	Manañam niyta atiymanchu
I can't work on it now.	Kunanqa manañam chaypi llamk'ayta atiymanchu.
Maybe you are, maybe you’re not.	Ichapas kanki, ichapas mana.
It just can’t do it.	Chaylla mana ruwayta atinchu.
He knows how to play.	Payqa pukllayta yachan.
I will always do it.	Sapa kutim ruwasaq.
I couldn’t speak anymore	Manañam rimayta atirqanichu
As always, I want to be better.	Sapa kuti hinam aswan allin kayta munani.
I couldn’t let anything happen to him	Manam atirqanichu imapas paywan pasananta
He probably wasn’t here.	Manapaschá kaypichu karqan.
A man who is out of place	Mana maypi kasqanpi kaq runa
Something wasn’t right.	Imapas manam allinchu karqa.
I thought he was gone	Manaña kasqanmantam piensarqani
But he is not sure.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kashan.
I don’t know that for sure at all	Chaytaqa manan imapipas allintachu yachani
I doubt this is true.	Iskayrayani kayqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
He says he’s right.	Payqa ninmi.
I did something quickly	Imatapas usqhayllan ruwarqani
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
Something is wrong.	Imapas mana allin.
That’s longer.	Chayqa aswan unayta.
I think he’s planning to talk to you	Yuyaykuni qanwan rimayta yuyaykushan
It was such a good thing.	Chayna allinmi karqa.
I just didn’t know what to do about it	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu chaymanta imata ruwanayta
He certainly could.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa atinman karqan.
I wonder who it might be	Pitaq kanman chayta tapukuni
He realized they weren’t right.	Payqa repararqanmi mana allinchu kasqankuta.
I can't tell you now	Kunanqa manam willayta atiymanchu
I would have to do it	Ñuqaqa ruwanay kanman karqan
Being the best you can be.	Aswan allin kaq kay.
I probably don’t like it.	Manapaschá gustawanchu.
I didn’t know where he was	Manam yacharqanichu maypi kasqanmanta
I’m a very nice guy.	Ancha sumaqmi kani.
That would seem to do it.	Chayqa ruwanman hinam kanman.
I still can't believe it, really.	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu, chiqaptapuni.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I’m not sure he knows	Manam segurochu kani yachasqanmanta
I didn’t know it was going to happen	Manam yacharqanichu chayna kananta
He knows what is right and what is wrong.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna allin kasqanmanta, imakuna mana allin kasqanmanta.
I can't say how many.	Manam niyta atiymanchu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
I’ve never seen it before.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
But it may not be a good idea.	Ichaqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
More on this here.	Astawan kaymanta kaypi.
I didn’t want this to happen	Manam munarqanichu kay pasananta
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
I was really excited.	Chiqaptam kusisqa karqani.
Twenty times not.	Iskay chunka kuti mana.
I know what it’s like	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta
That’s the only one.	Chay sapallan.
I know all about it	Tukuy chaymanta yachani
I look forward to this process.	Kay ruwayta suyachkani.
Yes, this is a good thing.	Arí, kayqa allinmi.
I’m sure you’ll do well.	Seguro kani allinta ruwanaykipaq.
I question everything	Tukuy imatam tapukuni
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
Tomorrow will be better.	Paqarinmi aswan allin kanqa.
I didn’t want to be that person	Manam chay runa kaytaqa munarqanichu
I think that would have been a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
It still exists today	Kunankamapas hinallam kachkan
Maybe it was the case.	Ichapas chayna karqa.
But that was a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi karqan.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Ichapas paqarin tuta.
I couldn’t keep up with it	Manam chayman hina ruwayta atiymanchu karqa
He was like that.	Payqa hinam karqa.
I think they’re happy	Yuyaykuni kusisqa kasqankuta
Three for sure.	Kimsa seguro.
There and there.	Chaypi chaypi.
All right, great.	Allinmi, hatun.
But then, he never could.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa, manan hayk’aqpas atirqanchu.
If you want to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayta munaspaqa.
I didn’t mean you didn’t	Manam niyta munarqanichu mana chaynata ruwasqaykita
You can’t do that.	Manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I can't do that here	Chaytaqa manam kaypiqa ruwaymanchu
I can’t talk to him yet.	Manaraqmi paywan rimayta atinichu.
I can’t say what it is	Manam niyta atiymanchu ima kasqanmantaqa
It was supposed to be a good day.	Allin punchawmi kanan karqa.
It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
Maybe both are true	Ichapas iskayninku chiqap kasqankuta
It doesn’t exist in time.	Manan tiempopiqa kanchu.
But I knew it would happen.	Ichaqa yacharqanim chayna kananta.
They aren’t really.	Paykunaqa manan cheqaqtachu kanku.
He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allin runam karqa.
I didn’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yacharqanichu.
I am so glad that it did	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chayna kasqanmanta
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
I mean, please.	Niyta munani, ama hina kaspa.
I knew what he was doing	Yacharqanim ima ruwasqanmanta
I want to know what happened here	Kaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta yachayta munani
He wanted nothing to do with her.	Payqa manan imatapas paywan ruwayta munarqanchu.
I might too, one day	Ñuqapas ichapas, huk punchaw
But now it looks very bad.	Ichaqa kunanqa ancha mana allinmi rikchakun.
He was a great man, a great man.	Payqa hatun runam karqa, hatun runam karqa.
I was sure it would be good	Seguro karqani allin kananmanta
What he’s done.	Ima ruwasqanmanta.
I’m really going to go	Chiqaptam risaq
The very best of the best.	Ancha allin kaq.
I have three people with me	Kimsa runam ñuqawan kachkan
Other than that, he was fine.	Mana chaymantaqa, payqa allinmi karqa.
A seriously injured man.	Sinchi k’irisqa runa.
I know this is not always the case	Yachanim kayqa manam sapa kutichu chayna kasqanmanta
It may not be a good idea.	Manapaschá allinchu kanman.
I know that for sure	Chaytaqa allintam yachani
I think about that a lot.	Chaymantaqa anchatam piensani.
I can’t be sure.	Manam seguro kayta atiymanchu.
I wanted to know if that was the case	Chayna kasqanmantam yachayta munarqani
He’s, he’s.	Payqa, payqa.
He is alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kachkan.
Do this, do that.	Kayta ruway, chayta ruway.
He is not alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu kachkan.
Of course.	Riki.
You’re here to stay.	Kaypi kanki.
I can’t do this.	Manam kayta ruwaymanchu.
I know it now.	Kunanmi yachani.
I doubt that’s all	Iskayrayani chaylla kasqanmanta
That’s still the case.	Chayqa hinallam kachkan.
He wasn’t sure he would do anything happy, ever.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan kusisqa imatapas ruwananmanta, hayk’aqpas.
Three.	Kimsa.
I’ve always been here.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi kaypi karqani.
Not sure if this is correct.	Mana segurochu kayqa allinchu icha manachu.
It still exists today.	Kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.
I just thought of something.	Chayraqmi imapipas yuyaykurqani.
He can't do it.	Payqa manam ruwayta atinmanchu.
You want to do something.	Imatapas ruwayta munanki.
I really want that.	Chaytaqa anchatam munani.
This was a great experience.	Kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He's doing really well.	Payqa chiqaptam allinta ruwachkan.
He says he’s right.	Payqa ninmi.
Not much of a smile.	Mana anchatachu.
He is very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
I didn't think it would be that hard really	Manam piensarqanichu chayna sasa kananta chiqaptapuni
You can’t tell.	Manam willayta atiwaqchu.
But probably not.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana.
Be.	Kay.
I think he liked it a lot	Yuyaykuni anchata gustasqanmanta
Here’s one, here’s another.	Kaypi huk, kaypi huk.
But that won’t be a good thing.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu kanqa.
He can’t be this.	Payqa manan kayta atinmanchu.
He thought it best not to do so.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi mana chayta ruwayqa aswan allin kananpaq.
I did something right	Imatapas allintam ruwarqani
In fact, it’s great.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha allinmi.
I fear the worst thing that could ever happen tomorrow	Manchakuni aswan mana allin kaq paqarin haykapipas pasananta
Not so sure he did.	Mana ancha segurochu kani chay ruwasqanmanta.
It was certainly bigger.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan hatun karqan.
For example,.	Kay hina,.
What did I do with it? 	¿Imatam ruwarqani?
'nothing'.	'mana imapas'.
He was badly injured.	Payqa sinchitan k’irisqa karqan.
I meant to say that.	Chaytaqa niyta munarqani.
I didn’t think it could get any worse	Manam yuyaykurqanichu aswan mana allin kananta
Maybe you know something, maybe you don’t.	Ichapas imatapas yachanki, ichapas mana yachankichu.
I don't think it ever will	Manam piensanichu haykapipas chayna kananta
I’m sure he will.	Seguro kani chayta ruwananmanta.
He certainly did.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.
But you learned quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan yacharqanki.
Nothing was right anymore.	Manañam imapas allinchu karqa.
That’s more.	Chayqa aswan.
I think that would be a good thing	Chayqa allinmi kanman, nispaymi
I mean, hard.	Niyta munani, sinchi.
It wouldn’t be easy.	Manam facilchu kanman.
I can’t do anything about it	Manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu
I know that he will	Yachanim chayna ruwananta
That he was a very strong man.	Ancha sinchi runa kasqanmanta.
He is indeed present.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kashan.
I know you can do this	Yachanim kayta ruwayta atisqaykita
It’s not like that.	Mana hinachu.
I think it should be.	Yuyaykuni chayna kananta.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
She thought maybe it was the man	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi ichapas chay runa kanman nispa
Actually, maybe not.	Chiqaptaqa, ichapas mana.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
I mean one.	Niyta munani huk.
I just didn’t know how he was going to do it	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imayna ruwananta
That was about right.	Chayqa yaqa allinmi karqa.
It wasn’t very good.	Manam ancha allinchu karqa.
I thought you were someone else	Huk runa kasqaykita yuyaykurqani
He doesn’t want to talk to you.	Payqa manan qanwan rimayta munanchu.
You want to know, okay.	Yachayta munanki, allinmi.
That’s you and me, now.	Chayqa qamwan ñuqawan, kunanqa.
I'm really sorry.	Chiqaptam llakikuni.
I can’t deal with it now	Kunanqa manan chayta atipayta atiymanchu
How does he know that.	Imaynataq chayta yachan.
I wasn't really too sure about this	Chiqaptaqa manam anchatachu kaymanta seguro karqani
It could be very bad, it could be good.	Ancha mana allin kanman, allin kanman.
Maybe that wasn’t the right thing to do.	Ichapas chayqa mana allinchu karqa.
He knows that, but he doesn’t know how.	Chaytaqa yachan, ichaqa manan yachanchu imaynatachus chayta yachan.
But it wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman.
I didn’t know that	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu
I just know he’s angry	Chaylla yachani phiñasqa kasqanmanta
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
I can’t do this anymore	Manañam kayta ruwayta atiymanchu
He had no idea what was in it.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imakuna chaypi kashasqanmanta.
He knew what was going to happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus kananta.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
I don't think that's the case	Manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensanichu
But it’s a human being	Ichaqa huk runa
I thought something was very, very wrong	Imapas ancha, ancha mana allin kasqanmantam piensarqani
I knew he knew more.	Yacharqanim astawan yachasqanmanta.
I wasn’t sure what he meant	Mana segurochu karqani ima niyta munasqanmanta
I don’t really know.	Manam chiqaptaqa yachanichu.
This would not be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman.
I knew this was important	Yacharqanim kayqa ancha allin kasqanmanta
I know what it’s like	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta
No one knows this.	Kaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
I think you can say yes	Yuyaykuni arí niyta atisqaykita
Someone said something.	Pipas imatapas nisqa.
I mean nothing happened.	Niyta munani mana imapas pasasqanmanta.
It's like being there again.	Hukmanta chaypi kay hinam.
He said he wanted to talk.	Rimayta munan nispa.
To be able to.	Allin kananpaq.
I knew what was going on there	Yacharqanim chaypi imakuna pasasqanmanta
Obviously this takes some practice.	Sut’inmi kayqa wakin ruwayta munan.
I've always been a little bit like that	Sapa kutim huk chikan chayna karqani
He knew it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi.
But now it’s worse.	Ichaqa kunanqa aswan mana allinmi.
What would happen if.	Imataq kanman sichus.
Isn’t that the only thing.	Manachu chaylla.
Sure he does.	Seguro payqa ruwan.
They are still there.	Paykunaqa hinallam kachkanku.
I thought that was the case.	Chayqa chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I wasn’t really happy about it	Manam chiqap kusisqachu karqani chaymanta
He is not the right person for you.	Payqa manam qampaq hinachu.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan.
All right, all right.	Allinmi, allin.
I hope he isn’t mad at me	Suyachkani mana ñuqawan phiñasqa kananta
I was with him every day	Sapa punchawmi paywan karqani
I don't know.	Manam yachanichu.
I really mean it.	Chiqaptam niyta munani.
Both of them are.	Iskayninkum.
But it’s beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi.
It’s not like any other.	Manam huk hinachu.
! 	!
I said yes and he went from there	Arí nispaymi chaymanta rirqa
No one is sure.	Mana pipas segurochu.
This is indeed the case.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa.
I couldn’t believe this would happen again	Mana creeyta atirqanichu kay hukmanta pasananta
I really was.	Chiqaptam karqani.
Something like that.	Imapas chayna.
I am still the same today	Kunankamapas hinallam kachkani
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
I hope it is, there	Suyachkani chayna kasqanmanta, chaypi
But that’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu.
I know you are not happy here	Yachanim kaypi mana kusisqachu kasqaykita
But it probably should be.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayna kanan.
I hope he does.	Suyachkani chayta ruwananta.
One by one, one by one.	Hukmanta hukmanta.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
He had to do it.	Payqa ruwanan karqan.
I’m not quite sure why.	Manam allintachu yachani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
I want it bad, but it can't be good	Mana allintam munani, ichaqa manam allinchu kanman
It wasn’t the first time.	Manam ñawpaq kutichu karqa.
I know it won't be easy	Yachanim mana facilchu kananta
He must continue to do so.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwanan.
But I don’t know why	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imarayku
I knew this was coming	Yacharqanim kay hamunanta
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
That’s it.	Chayqa.
You never know.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu.
I couldn’t tell either	Ñuqapas manam willayta atirqanichu
I just didn’t want to talk to him anymore	Chaylla manaña paywan rimayta munarqanichu
I really want to go.	Anchatan munani riyta.
That wasn’t easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan.
I didn’t mean this conversation	Manam kay rimayta munarqanichu
I should have done better.	Aswan allintam ruwanay karqa.
That’s probably the case.	Chayqa yaqapaschá kanman.
I very much hope he does	Anchatam suyachkani chayta ruwananpaq
That wasn’t such a bad thing.	Chayqa manan chhayna mana allinchu karqan.
But that was a very long time ago.	Ichaqa chayqa ancha unayñan karqan.
They are both great.	Iskayninkum hatun kanku.
He didn’t know she was there.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chaypi kashasqanmanta.
I thought there was more	Aswan achka kasqanmantam piensarqani
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
But he knew that would not be the case.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kananta.
I don't know why that is.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
I can’t help it, really	Manam yanapayta atiymanchu, chiqaptaqa
One day.	Huk punchaw.
Never thought of doing anything else.	Mana hayk’aqpas huk ruwayta yuyaykurqanchu.
Maybe I like this one	Ichapas kayta gustan
But it wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman.
I hadn’t thought of that.	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu.
All right, whatever.	Allinmi, imapas.
I didn’t mean that.	Manam chayta niyta munarqanichu.
He wasn’t here yet.	Payqa manaraqmi kaypichu karqan.
I knew he wasn't coming	Yacharqanim manaña hamunanta
I hadn’t thought of this	Kaytaqa manam yuyaykurqanichu
He didn't care about that.	Chaytaqa manam imananpaschu karqa.
This is actually a good thing.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa allinmi.
I want to know about this happening	Kay pasasqanmanta yachayta munani
He was never like this.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hinachu karqan.
This process was the best.	Kay ruwayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
I mean, he’s a really good guy	Niyta munani, payqa chiqap allin runam
It's pretty obvious.	Allin sut'inmi.
He is well aware of the consequences.	Payqa allintam yachan chay ruwasqanmanta imakuna pasananta.
Very good.	Aswan allinmi.
I know about everything	Tukuy imamanta yachani
I was there that day	Chay punchawmi chaypi karqani
It shouldn’t be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan.
I couldn’t believe he would do that	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayna ruwananta
I want to do it here	Kaypi ruwayta munani
Tomorrow if you want.	Paqarin munaspaqa.
I know he won't.	Yachanim mana chayta ruwananta.
It may not be a good idea.	Manapaschá allinchu kanman.
Okay, that seems pretty bad.	Allinmi, chayqa ancha mana allinmi rikchakun.
But that doesn’t matter, after all.	Ichaqa manan chayqa imananpaschu, tukuy imamanta.
He is a beautiful man.	Payqa sumaq runam.
I don’t know much about it.	Manam anchatachu yachani.
You never know.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu.
Do the right thing.	Chayta ruway.
If you want to do it, do it.	Ruwayta munanki chayqa, ruway.
I am such a person.	Chayna runam kani.
I may not have said it right	Manapaschá allintachu nirqani
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.

Do what you want to do.	Ruway munasqaykita ruway.
It’s better than good.	Aswan allinmi allin kasqanmantaqa.
Which isn’t a bad thing.	Imataq mana mana allinchu.
But that’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu chayqa.
I didn’t think this would happen	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kay pasananta

I couldn’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu.

Everything was wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allinchu kasqa.

This is very.	Kayqa ancha.
I still don't know how it happened.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imayna pasasqanmanta.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.

If only he were here.	Sichus kaypi kanman karqan chayqa.
I didn’t know he was married.	Manam yacharqanichu casarasqa kasqanmanta.

It was a beautiful day.	Sumaq punchawmi karqa.
I didn’t think it was coming	Manam yuyaykurqanichu chay hamunanta

I knew that was the case	Yacharqanim chayna kasqanmanta
All day, every day.	Tukuy punchaw, sapa punchaw.
I know that for sure	Chaytaqa allintam yachani
I think he’s happy.	Yuyaykuni kusisqa kashasqanmanta.
But it’s worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi.
I don’t like it.	Manam gustanchu.
I’m not sure why he did that.	Manam segurochu kani imarayku chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I anticipate that it might be more difficult	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi yuyaykuni aswan sasa kanman chayta
I’m a very nice guy.	Ancha sumaqmi kani.
It’s not a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu.
I know too much	Llumpay achkatam yachani
But it’s not quite right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu.
But I never knew that	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa yacharqanichu
It’s not easy.	Manan facilchu.
I thought that was too much	Chayqa llumpay kasqanmantam piensarqani
But I want to know a little bit	Ichaqa huk chhikantan yachayta munani
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinmi.
You will do it today.	Kunan punchawmi ruwanki.

But that didn't matter.	Ichaqa manan chayqa imananpaschu karqan.
I was just there.	Chayraqmi karqani.
Probably not.	Yaqapaschá mana.
I often wonder what he is doing now	Sapa kutim tapukuni kunan ima ruwasqanmanta
He knows what he’s going to do.	Payqa yachanmi ima ruwananta.
That wasn’t always the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
But here it is.	Ichaqa kaypi.
I still haven't seen anything	Kunankamapas manam imatapas rikurqanichu
I didn’t know what was wrong	Manam ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa yacharqanichu
I’m very good at this	Kaypiqa ancha allinmi kani
It’s not really.	Manam chiqaptachu.
I didn’t do it right	Manam allintachu ruwarqani
He sensed it had to be someone else.	Payqa repararqanmi huk runa kananta.
All very human.	Tukuy ancha runa.
It is.	Kayqa.
But it’s not the best.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu.
I was so excited about it	Ñuqaqa ancha kusisqam karqani
I still don't know why.	Manam kunankamapas yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I really couldn't believe it.	Chiqaptaqa manam creeyta atirqanichu.
I’m afraid of everything	Tukuy imatam manchakuni
Very much.	Anchata.
Now he realized that this was not the case.	Kunanqa repararqanmi mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
That he wasn't there that night.	Chay tuta mana chaypi kasqanmanta.
You can never know.	Manam haykapipas yachayta atiwaqchu.
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.

You have a lot to do.	Achka ruwanayki kachkan.
I didn’t know how to do that	Manam chayta ruwayta yacharqanichu
You may never know	Ichapas mana haykapipas yachankichu
Little else was wrong with that.	Chaymanta pisi imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I didn’t do much of it at the time	Chay tiempopiqa manan anchatachu chaytaqa ruwarqani
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I'm sure it will.	Seguro kani chayna kananta.

I'll do it right	Allintam ruwasaq
It doesn’t seem right.	Manam allinchu rikchakun.
But then he didn't think so.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan chaytaqa yuyaykurqanchu.
I hadn’t thought of that	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu
He’s actually the best.	Payqa chiqaptaqa aswan allinmi.
I would be a human being	Huk runam kayman
That’s going to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanqa.
He can't go.	Payqa manam riyta atinchu.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.

It wasn’t supposed to be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan karqan.
You’re happy to be there.	Kusisqam kachkanki.
I know this is going to happen	Yachanim kayqa kananta
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
I’m not a good guy.	Manam allinchu kani.
I knew it wasn’t going to happen	Yacharqanim mana chayna kananta
This would be wrong to say.	Kayqa mana allinchu kanman niyta.
This was actually a good thing.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa allinmi karqa.
I’m not a good guy.	Manam allinchu kani.
I didn’t want to say any more.	Manañam astawan rimayta munarqanichu.
That’s a nice thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
No one is right.	Manan pipas allinchu.
He wasn’t sure he liked it.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan gustasqanmanta.
I wish I could talk every night	Munaymanmi sapa tuta rimayta

Maybe not though.	Ichapas mana ichaqa.

It wasn’t like it is now.	Manam kunan hinachu karqa.
No one knew he was here.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu kaypi kashasqanmanta.
It was going to be very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi kanan karqa.
I didn’t see it anymore to pretend	Manañam rikurqanichu hina ruwanaypaq
I wonder if he knows how beautiful it is	Tapukuni sichus yachan imayna sumaq kasqanmanta
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
I couldn’t speak	Manam rimayta atirqanichu
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I was early enough.	Ñuqaqa temprano karqani.
It’s not like anywhere else.	Manam maypi hinachu kachkan.
I’m not good enough for you	Manam qampaq allinchu kani

He wants to play badly.	Mana allinta pukllayta munan.

This one was the best.	Kayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
He was angry and hurt.	Payqa phiñasqa, k’irisqa kasqa.
I loved it so much	Anchatam munarqani
It just didn’t go well.	Chaylla mana allintachu rirqa.
It would mean something.	Imapas niyta munanman.
But I couldn’t tell you that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa willayta atirqanichu
I just thought, you know .	Chaylla yuyaykurqani, yachanki .

Not much, anymore.	Mana anchatachu, manaña.

I don't know if you know this.	Mana yachanichu kayta yachanki icha manachu.
I didn’t think you could do this	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kayta ruwayta atisqaykita
He was angry about something.	Payqa imamantapas phiñasqa kasqa.
But they are not sure.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kanku.
But no one wanted to come.	Ichaqa manan pipas hamuyta munarqanchu.
This was a wonderful experience.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I didn’t always succeed	Manam sapa kutichu allinta ruwarqani
That’s the way it is.	Chayqa hinam.
But it wouldn’t be much longer.	Ichaqa manan aswan unaytachu kanman.
Some bad, some good.	Wakin mana allin, wakin allin.
Maybe he would have.	Ichapas chaytaqa ruwanman karqa.

Something is wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
I don’t want to be here either.	Ñuqapas manam kaypi kayta munanichu.

But I don’t know why	Ichaqa manan imarayku chaytaqa yachanichu
I wish I could, but I don't	Munaymanmi ichaqa mana
Now I question everything.	Kunanqa tukuy imatam tapukuni.
I will never be happy again.	Manañam haykapipas kusisqachu kasaq.
I want to share everything with him	Paywan tukuy imata willayta munani
He is a beautiful man.	Payqa sumaq runam.
I thought he might want to join us	Yuyarqanim ichapas ñuqaykuwan kuska kayta munanman

That would be a little nice.	Chayqa huk chikan sumaqmi kanman.

That was really about it.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin chaymanta karqan.

He is not alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu.
That’ll do it.	Chayqa ruwanqa.
I won’t always be here	Manam sapa kutichu kaypi kasaq

I just know it’s going to be good	Chaylla yachani allin kananta
I don’t know much about it.	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa yachani.

I know you do that.	Yachanim chayta ruwasqaykita.
He had a history of failure.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi mana allintachu ruwaq.

I knew there was no one else here	Yacharqanim kaypiqa mana huk runa kasqanmanta

He was here to stay.	Payqa kaypi kasqa.
I couldn’t believe it	Manam creeyta atirqanichu
I know how hard it is	Yachanim imayna sasa kasqanmanta

I'm very good at it.	Ancha allinmi kani.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
He didn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
But I didn’t want to talk to him	Ichaqa manan paywan rimayta munarqanichu
You can't do it now.	Kunanqa manam atiwaqchu.
I’m glad this happened.	Kusikuni kay pasasqanmanta.
He didn’t want it to be easy.	Payqa manan facilchu kananta munarqan.
Okay, do this.	Allinmi, kayta ruway.
It would have made everything better.	Chayqa tukuy imatam aswan allinta ruwanman karqa.

I am sure it will be good	Seguro kani allin kananmanta
I never thought I would do that	Manam haykapipas chayta ruwanaypaqqa piensarqanichu
There’s nothing like that.	Chaytaqa manan imapas kanchu.
It means something.	Imatapas niyta munan.
Perhaps we are.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanchik.
That may be the case for you.	Chayna kanman qampaq.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.

But no one knows anything.	Ichaqa manan pipas imatapas yachanchu.

Why was that the case?.	¿Imanasqataq chayna karqa?.
I couldn’t speak, I didn’t want to speak	Manam rimayta atirqanichu, manam rimayta munarqanichu
What could be better?!.	¿Imataq aswan allin kanman?!.
I am very happy about that.	Chaymantaqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.

This would be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi kanman.
I knew it was no big deal.	Ñuqaqa yacharqanim mana hatun ruway kasqanmanta.
But that is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kashan.
Of course, he didn’t know she was there.	Arí, manan yacharqanchu chaypi kashasqanmanta.
It has to be that way.	Chayna kanan tiyan.
I thought that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I’m a great guy.	Hatun runam kani.
Now.	Kunan.
I really couldn’t say	Chiqaptaqa manam niyta atirqanichu
I know exactly what is wrong	Allintam yachani ima mana allin kasqanmanta
I will certainly do so.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwasaq.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
There were supposed to be three.	Kimsa kanan karqa.

Would that really be so difficult?.	¿Cheqaqtachu chayqa ancha sasa kanman?.
Everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
Something like that, it was very difficult.	Imapas chayna, ancha sasa karqa.
I'll be there this afternoon	Kunan tarde chaypi kasaq
To succeed, you have to succeed.	Allinta ruwanaykipaqqa mana allintam ruwanayki.

He was better than this, better than that.	Payqa kaymanta aswan allin, chaymanta aswan allin karqan.
Two days, two nights.	Iskay punchaw, iskay tuta.
That’s probably not right with me.	Chayqa ichapas ñuqawanqa mana allinchu kachkan.

This is not easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu.
I still can't believe it	Kunankamapas manam creeyta atinichu
Yes, he can’t.	Arí, manan atinchu.
Performance performance performance.	Ruway ruway ruway ruway.
Maybe he’ll do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanman.
He certainly wasn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu karqan.

No one is ever right or wrong.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.

I know you probably have to do something	Yachanim yaqapaschá imapas ruwanayki kasqanmanta
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I couldn’t do that	Chaytaqa manam atirqanichu
I’m excited about what it can do	Kusikuni imakuna ruway atisqanmanta
I thought it might be something else	Yuyarqanim huk imapas kanman nispa
I’m, like, excited.	Ñuqaqa, hina, kusisqam kachkani.
I wonder why he did that	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayta ruwarqa
He can't help it.	Mana yanapayta atinchu.
Either you have to do something, or you have to do something.	Icha imatapas ruwanayki, icha imatapas ruwanayki.
I didn’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymantaqa rimayta munarqanichu.
No one likes to do that.	Chay ruwayqa manam pipas gustanchu.
I think this will be good	Kayqa allinmi kanqa nispan yuyaykuni
I didn’t want to know.	Manam yachayta munarqanichu.
I wish he would do it more often	Munaymanmi aswan sapa kuti ruwananta

That was something.	Chayqa imapas karqa.
I probably don’t like it	Manapaschá gustawanchu

After all, it’s.	Tukuy imamanta.

I didn’t think it was a bad thing	Manam mana allin ruway kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu
That was the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allinmi karqa.

You’re doing a good job.	Allintam ruwanki.
I think that was his name.	Chayqa sutinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.

I knew what that one thing was going to be	Yacharqanim chay huk imapas ima kananta
He is a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
I said no, I didn't.	Manam nispaymi nirqani.
I really didn’t want to believe it	Cheqaqtapunin mana creeyta munarqanichu
Someone has to do that.	Pipas chayta ruwanan.
I still wasn't happy about it.	Kunankamapas manam kusisqachu karqani chaymantaqa.
I am very happily married.	Ancha kusisqam casarasqa kachkani.

Now I don't know what to say.	Kunanqa manam yachanichu ima niyta.

I knew something was going to happen	Yacharqanim imapas kananta

All this stuff is pretty cool.	Tukuy kay imapas ancha sumaqmi.
I wasn’t sure it was the right thing to do	Manam segurochu karqani allin ruway kasqanmanta
Now this is very good.	Kunanqa kayqa ancha allinmi.

Nothing would be right.	Manan imapas allinchu kanman.
But it’s not here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu.
I didn’t see this coming.	Manam rikurqanichu kay hamunanta.

I'm sure he knew something wasn't quite right.	Seguro kani yachasqanmanta imapas mana allintachu kasqanmanta.
But I couldn’t do that	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu
He loves it so much.	Payqa anchatam munan.
That’s what he did.	Chaytan payqa ruwarqan.
I didn’t know there was such a thing	Manam yacharqanichu chayna imapas kasqanmantaqa
I don't know.	Manam yachanichu.
To make things better.	Imapas allin kananpaq.
Being tired of it.	Sayk’usqa kasqanmanta.
Do whatever you want there.	Chaypi ima munasqaykita ruway.
That’s what I did.	Chaytan ruwarqani.
Some, more.	Wakin, astawan.
That would speed up the process.	Chayqa usqhayllan chay ruwayta ruwanman.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
He was a little nervous.	Payqa huk chhikantan mancharisqa kasharqan.
I know how many there are.	Yachanim hayka kasqanmanta.
I doubt anyone wants to tackle it	Iskayrayani pipas chayta atipayta munasqanmanta
Very, very true.	Ancha, ancha chiqap.
' year'.	' wata'.
But he did what he said he would do.	Ichaqa nisqanman hinam ruwarqa.
Now I have to do something	Kunanmi ima ruwanay kachkan

You are not good at this.	Kaypiqa manam allinchu kanki.

Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I was probably a little uncomfortable	Yaqapaschá huk chhikanta mana allinchu karqani
Probably probably.	Yaqapaschá yaqapaschá.
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
It will take about two days.	Yaqa iskay punchawmi kanqa.
In fact, he was.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa karqa.
I couldn’t talk or anything.	Manam rimayta atirqanichu nitaq imatapas.
Clearly it’s not.	Sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.

It doesn’t matter where.	Manam imananpaschu maypi.
You obviously don’t know anything about it.	Sut’inmi chaymantaqa mana imatapas yachankichu.

It’s just always there.	Chaylla sapa kuti chaypi kachkan.
Not sure what could have gone wrong.	Mana segurochu imachus mana allin kanman karqan chayta.
Now he wants more and more and more.	Kunanqa astawan astawan astawan munan.
That was a great experience	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa

It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I wonder if he’s happy.	Kusisqa kasqanmanta tapukuni.
I didn’t want to tell you anything	Manam imatapas willayta munarqanichu
He certainly said that	Cheqaqtapunin chayta nirqan
Things were still wrong.	Hinallam imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I'm so sorry.	Anchatam llakikuni.

Is that right?.	¿Allinchu chay?.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
I really didn’t want to be	Chiqaptaqa manam kayta munarqanichu
I didn’t really want that	Chaytaqa manan anchatachu munarqani

There is nothing I can do here.	Kaypiqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
But it doesn’t matter now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa imananpaschu.
I don't know why that is.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
I could not believe this.	Kaytaqa manam creeyta atirqanichu.
This is not easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu.
I can't say that.	Chaytaqa manam niyta atiymanchu.
Probably nothing, but he couldn't be sure.	Yaqapaschá mana imapas, ichaqa manan seguro kayta atirqanchu.
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.
I don’t want anything.	Manam imatapas munanichu.

One good often two	Huk allin sapa kuti iskay
Everything is fine with me.	Tukuy imapas allinmi ñuqawanqa.
Almost last night.	Yaqa qayna tuta.

Do this immediately.	Chaytaqa chaylla ruway.

It was a really nice day.	Chiqap sumaq punchawmi karqa.
Not not not not.	Mana mana mana mana.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
He doesn’t want to talk to me.	Payqa manan munanchu ñoqawan rimayta.

I just didn’t want to talk	Chaylla mana rimayta munarqanichu
I didn’t know what he wanted from me	Manam yacharqanichu imata ñuqamanta munasqanmanta
I thought it would be bad, but it wasn’t	Yuyarqanin mana allinchu kananta, ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan
He can’t handle it anymore.	Manaña chayta atipayta atinchu.
I was pretty sure of that	Yaqapaschá chaymanta seguro karqani
They are not, however.	Paykunaqa manan ichaqa.
But that wouldn't matter.	Ichaqa manan chayqa imananpaschu kanman.
I know where they are	Yachanim maypi kasqankuta
That’s what I said.	Chaytan nirqani.

That’s what that means.	Chayqa chay niyta munan.
It was pretty good.	Allin allinmi karqa.
But it looked nice.	Ichaqa sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
I certainly played a part in it	Cheqaqtapunin chaypi huk ruwayta ruwarqani
Not really good.	Mana chiqap allinchu.
I didn’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu.
I need to do this quickly	Kayta utqaylla ruwanay tiyan
It’s been a tough week.	Sinchi semanan karqan.

He was in a state of distress.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan.

Don’t know what it is.	Ama yachankichu ima kasqanmanta.

But he knew he was there.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chaypi kashasqanmanta.
I never want to go.	Manam haykapipas riyta munanichu.

But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu.
I need to do that now	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwanay
Maybe he should have been.	Ichapas payqa kanan karqa.

It was good though.	Allinmi ichaqa karqa.

But that’s all.	Ichaqa chaylla.

I knew what it was like.	Yacharqanim imayna kasqanmanta.

Then he had to be sure.	Chaymantaqa segurom kanan karqa.
Please more, more.	Ama hina kaspa aswan, aswan.
I am very sorry about that.	Anchatam llakikuni chaymanta.

But you need to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanayki.
But it would be nice.	Ichaqa sumaqmi kanman.
He declined to comment further.	Payqa manan munarqanchu astawan rimayta.

But it could be worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.

That was it.	Chayqa karqa.
You knew nothing about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqankichu.

He didn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.

He is very hurt and sad.	Payqa ancha k’irisqa, llakisqa ima kashan.
I can’t do anything about it.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
I mean, probably.	Niyta munani, yaqapaschá.
He wanted it so badly.	Payqa sinchitan munarqan.
Now he couldn't do anything about it.	Kunanqa manan chaymantaqa imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
Of course.	Riki.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
He does something	Imatapas ruwan .
He probably was.	Payqa yaqapaschá karqan.
I’ve done that.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani.
He’s not alone.	Manan sapallanchu.

It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.

You are a very good guy.	Qamqa ancha allinmi kanki.

What do you do about it?.	¿Imatataq chaymanta ruwanki?.
I knew he would.	Yacharqanim chayta ruwananta.

Something always does, you know.	Imapas sapa kutim ruwan, yachanki.
It wasn’t a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu karqa.
That’s something I always enjoy.	Chayqa sapa kutim kusikuni.

I’m happy to be around.	Kusisqam kachkani.
I'm not that happy about it.	Manam chayna kusisqachu kani chaymantaqa.
But he’s not sure where he is now .	Ichaqa manan segurochu kashan kunan maypi kasqanmanta .
He was a lonely man.	Payqa sapallan runam karqa.
I would be very busy.	Ancha ocupasqa kayman.
He had to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
It’s not the best.	Mana aswan allinchu.
He wanted to talk again.	Hukmanta rimayta munarqa.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
Something there, maybe.	Imapas chaypi, ichapas.
That’s what he would have done.	Chaytan payqa ruwanman karqan.
Second, he loves to play the game.	Iskay kaq, payqa anchatam munan pukllayta pukllayta.

But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
But this wasn’t right.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu kasharqan.
Maybe you know why.	Ichapas yachanki imanasqa kasqanmanta.
Yes, it’s not a good thing.	Arí, mana allinchu.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
This can't last long.	Kayqa manam unaytachu kanman.

More than nothing else.	Mana imamanta aswan achka.
This is a very bad thing.	Kayqa ancha mana allinmi.
That was not an easy task.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu karqan.
He looked like he always did.	Payqa sapa kuti hinam rikchakurqa.
That, however, is not the case.	Chayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
But perhaps this was not always the case.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
This would have to do.	Kayqa ruwanan kanman karqan.
You’re not good enough.	Manam allinchu kanki.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He probably needs it.	Yaqapaschá necesitan.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Mana allinchu karqan.
No one was sure why.	Manam pipas segurochu karqa imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
Now, be honest.	Kunanqa, chiqap kay.
You make the first payment.	Ñawpaq kaq qullqita ruwanki.

Well! 	Allin!
I don't know what to do.	Manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
You can’t do any better.	Manan aswan allinta ruwayta atiwaqchu.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
Obviously, he did.	Sut’inmi, chaytaqa ruwarqan.
You don’t know.	Manam yachankichu.
That it isn’t.	Mana chayna kasqanmanta.
But it's obviously wrong.	Ichaqa sut'inmi mana allinchu.

Man, that stuff is good.	Runa, chay imapas allinmi.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.

I'm sure it exists.	Seguro kani kasqanmanta.
He refused to say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas rimayta munarqanchu.
Of course, it’s not that simple.	Arí, manan chay hina facilchu.
Something was seriously wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas sinchi mana allinmi karqa.

But he refused, of course.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu, cheqaqtapunin.
I’m not really good.	Manam chiqap allinchu kani.
He was eager to help.	Payqa anchatan munarqan imapipas yanapayta.
He wanted to tell her that.	Chayta willayta munarqa.
No, not really, but it probably was.	Manam, manam chiqaptachu, ichaqa yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
But then, maybe he was.	Ichaqa chaymanta, ichapas payqa karqan.
You don’t know why.	Mana yachankichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
But he didn’t want to tell her, not yet.	Ichaqa manan willayta munarqanchu, manaraqmi.
You can’t do it.	Manan atiwaqchu.

He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manan atirqanchu.

However, it is not.	Ichaqa, manan chay hinachu.

There is no time.	Manam tiempo kanchu.
I can’t say anything about it.	Manam chaymantaqa imatapas niyta atiymanchu.

That is not the case now.	Kunanqa manan chay hinachu.
I couldn’t believe he would do that.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayna ruwananta.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.

I had a lot to do.	Achka ruwanay karqa.
That is a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
But maybe it was.	Ichaqa ichapas chayna karqa.
That’s what he did last year.	Chaytan qayna wata ruwarqan.
It just wasn't safe.	Chaylla mana segurochu karqa.
But the name did.	Ichaqa sutinmi chaynata ruwarqa.
A lot, maybe.	Achka, ichapas.

No one knew what was going to happen.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imachus pasananta.
There was nothing else wrong.	Manam imapas huk mana allinchu karqa.
That’s what he did.	Chaytan payqa ruwarqan.
Otherwise it looked great.	Mana chayqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
No, it’s not even.	Manan, manan nitaq.
They’re both there, both real.	Iskayninku chaypi kachkanku, iskayninku chiqap.
He wasn’t sure he wanted to.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan munasqanmanta.
That’s not going to be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
It’s not safe.	Manam segurochu.
That is a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
Now this would be wrong.	Kunanqa kayqa mana allinchu kanman.
But this isn’t the case, man.	Ichaqa kayqa manan chay hinachu, runa.

But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I didn’t think much of it.	Manam anchatachu chaypi piensarqani.
I’m glad it didn’t work out.	Kusikuni mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
Clearly this is not the case.	Sut’inmi kayqa manan chay hinachu.
He was great, but not good enough.	Payqa ancha allinmi karqan, ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
No, it wasn’t good.	Manan, manan allinchu karqan.
He didn't know what that might be.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus chay kanman chayta.

It doesn’t get any worse than that.	Manam chaymantaqa aswan mana allinchu.

Always, always, someone else was there.	Sapa kuti, sapa kuti, huk runa chaypi karqa.

Why would that be the case?	¿Imanasqataq chayna kanman.

That really could have been something.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin imapas kanman karqan.

He’s just that.	Payqa chayraqmi.

It had to be quick.	Chayqa usqhayllan kanan karqan.
He did so quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan chayta ruwarqan.
This is probably not a good thing.	Kayqa manachá allinchu kanman.
I can’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atinichu.
Not me, either.	Manam ñuqapas.
Everyone is sad and worried.	Lliwmi llakisqa, llakisqa ima kanku.

Nothing is more certain.	Manan imapas aswan segurochu.

All right, you know.	Allinmi, yachanki.
I think that's about right.	Chayqa yaqa allin kasqanmantam piensani.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu.
That’s really all he said.	Cheqaqtapunin chaylla nisqa.
However, last night .	Ichaqa, qayna tuta .
I probably like it a lot.	Yaqapaschá anchata gustan.
It’s good, it’s not bad.	Allinmi, manam mana allinchu.

He thought nothing of it.	Payqa manan imatapas yuyaykurqanchu.
I wasn’t up to it, really.	Ñuqaqa mana chayman hinachu karqani, chiqaptapuni.
But he knew that.	Ichaqa chaytaqa yacharqanmi.

I didn’t want to believe it.	Manam creeyta munarqanichu.
I really can't say, for sure.	Chiqaptaqa manam niyta atiymanchu, seguro.
This is not correct now.	Kayqa kunanqa manan allinchu.
There had to be something else.	Huk imapas kanan karqa.
It’s not a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu.
I mean, that’s what I mean.	Chayta niyta munani.
That’s what he has to do.	Chaytan ruwanan.
That seems to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi rikchakun.
But there was nothing he could do.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
I want to play this game more often.	Kay pukllayta aswan sapa kuti pukllayta munani.
He said sure enough.	Payqa seguro nisqa.
This would be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi kanman.
Fortunately, that’s not quite right.	Ancha kusisqa, chayqa manan allintachu.
It was more interesting.	Aswan sumaqmi karqa.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
It can’t be all that bad.	Mana tukuy chay mana allin kayta atinchu.

Now he tells her to do something.	Kunanqa imatapas ruwananpaqmi nin.

But I did it.	Ichaqa ruwarqani.
Something was there.	Imapas chaypi kasqa.
But I’ve never been so happy.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hina kusisqachu karqani.

He obviously didn’t know she was married.	Sut’inmi mana yacharqanchu casarasqa kashasqanmanta.
He's sure of it.	Payqa segurom chaymanta.
That’s what it does.	Chaytan ruwan.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
Okay, now is the time.	Allinmi, kunanmi chay tiempo.
I thought something was wrong there.	Chaypi imapas mana allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.

Something had to happen.	Imapas kanan karqa.

This isn’t a good thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu.
It’s almost like he’s scared.	Yaqapaschá mancharisqa hina.

Maybe one day.	Ichapas huk punchaw.
He said that it was.	Payqa nirqam chayna kasqanmanta.
But nothing like that happened.	Ichaqa manan imapas chay hinachu karqan.
But what if.	Ichaqa, ¿imataq kanman sichus.
He said that to me in a good way.	Payqa allin hinam chaynata niwarqa.
You are so beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanki.
I was very clear.	Ancha sut’inmi karqani.
Why not? 	Imanasqa mana?
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.

It is indeed so.	Cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
He was a nice guy.	Payqa sumaq runam karqa.

He knew no one else would.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana pipas chayta ruwananta.

He’s a really good guy.	Payqa chiqap allin runam.

He would be fine, as always.	Payqa allinmi kanman, sapa kuti hina.
Everything was fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
There’s probably something about someone doing it.	Yaqapaschá imapas kanman pipas chayta ruwananpaq.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
What happened to him.	Imakuna pasasqanmanta.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.

But it won’t be here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu kanqa.
But he doesn’t seem happy.	Ichaqa manan kusisqachu rikch’akun.
He can’t do this.	Payqa manan kayta ruwayta atinmanchu.
It can still be.	Hinallam kanman.
Very good, very happy.	Ancha allin, ancha kusisqa.
The second method is better.	Iskay kaq ruwayqa aswan allinmi.
He had wanted it for a very long time.	Payqa ancha unayñan chayta munarqan.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
A few things.	Iskay kimsa imakuna.
He wanted that.	Payqa chaytan munarqan.
He pretended they were not.	Mana kasqankuta hinam ruwarqa.
That was the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
First, he says that.	Ñawpaqtaqa, payqa ninmi chay.
It was better than that.	Aswan allinmi karqan chaymantaqa.
Maybe it was always time.	Ichapas sapa kuti tiempo karqa.
It means in advance.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi niyta munan.
I won’t always be there.	Manam sapa kutichu chaypi kasaq.
I don’t think so.	Manam yuyanichu.
But he didn’t want to tell, and he couldn’t tell.	Ichaqa manan willayta munarqanchu, nitaq willayta atirqanchu.
No one is here yet.	Manaraqmi pipas kaypichu kachkan.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
He was a man after all.	Payqa runan karqan tukuy imamanta.
No one knows about it.	Manam pipas chaymantaqa yachanchu.
He is here to help.	Payqa kaypi kachkan yanapananpaq.
I didn’t want to say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta munarqanichu.
Tonight, if you will.	Kunan tuta, munaspaqa.
I want to go there too.	Ñuqapas chayman riyta munani.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Not much though.	Mana anchatachu ichaqa.
No, that wouldn’t be right.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I know there are many.	Yachanim achka kasqanmanta.
A very tired man.	Ancha sayk’usqa runa.
This was a man.	Kayqa huk runam karqa.

But if you think about it, that’s fine.	Ichaqa chayta yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
He doesn’t always do that.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwan.
Said it was night tonight.	Nisqa kunan tuta tuta kasqanmanta.
He still wanted to.	Payqa hinallam munarqa.
But he knew something.	Ichaqa imatapas yacharqanmi.
That would have been better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan.
I don't really like that.	Chayqa manam anchatachu gustan.
I certainly didn’t want to.	Cheqaqtapunin mana munarqanichu.
He can't speak.	Payqa manam rimayta atinchu.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Mana allin kasqa.
That was the angry thing.	Chayqa phiñasqa kasqa.
I want.	Munani.
She is beautiful though.	Payqa sumaqmi ichaqa.
It was a long time ago.	Unayñan karqan.
He seems very upset.	Payqa ancha llakisqa hinam kachkan.
He was like that.	Payqa hinam karqa.
Maybe you'll get hurt.	Ichapas k'irisqa kanki.
I wish it was here.	Munaymanmi kaypi kananta.
Very scared of it.	Ancha mancharisqa chaymanta.
Everything was secure.	Tukuy imapas segurom karqa.
Needless to say, it was.	Manañam niyta munanichu chayna kasqanmanta.
You never knew how someone would react.	Manan hayk’aqpas yacharqankichu pipas imayna ruwananta.
That says it doesn’t exist.	Chayqa ninmi mana kanchu nispa.
She was beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa.
Someone knows something.	Pipas imatapas yachan.

Everything should be better.	Tukuy imapas aswan allinmi kanan.
I'll probably do that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwasaq.
I'm really looking forward to it.	Chiqaptam chayta suyachkani.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
Sometimes.	Wakin kuti.
I’m not even sure it’s right.	Manam segurochu kani nitaq allin kasqanmanta.
It depends on the number.	Chayqa hayk’a kasqanmantan kanqa.
He looked at her carefully.	Payqa allintan qhawarirqan.
Now it will be fine.	Kunanqa allinmi kanqa.
It looks real.	Chiqap rikchakun.
Now, maybe that’s a good thing.	Kunanqa, ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
No it may not be the case.	Manan manapaschá chay hinachu kanman.
But that wouldn’t be the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu kanman.
How can you not.	Imaynatataq mana.
What could be better than that?.	¿Imataq chaymanta aswan allin kanman?.
No one knows anything about it.	Manan pipas chaymantaqa imatapas yachanchu.

Early afternoon.	Tarde temprano.
Yes, that is not a good thing.	Arí, chayqa manam allinchu.

He is not sure.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan.
Nothing is ever good enough.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas allinchu.

If you think about it, it would be good.	Sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi kanman.
It’s good, it’s very good.	Allinmi ancha allin.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
Great for you.	Hatun qampaq.

He was afraid of it.	Chayman mancharisqa.
They always are.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim kanku.
I really look forward to that.	Chiqaptam chaytaqa suyachkani.
That should be better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanan.
I didn’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu.
But it's clear.	Ichaqa sut'inmi.
Now he was terrified.	Kunanqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
Now, what is it? 	Kunanqa, ¿imataq?
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
And.	Chaymanta.
Make it better.	Aswan allinta ruway.
This is obviously quite.	Kayqa sut’inmi allinta.
I know you want to help.	Yachanim yanapayta munasqaykita.
A lot of things are good.	Achka imapas allinmi.

He must be sure.	Payqa segurom kanan.
He’s the nicest thing here.	Payqa kaypiqa aswan sumaqmi.
I wanted to know about it all.	Tukuy chaymanta yachayta munarqani.
But you don’t know that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa yachankichu.
You are beautiful.	Sumaqmi kanki.
He certainly would.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanman.
Said they were together.	Nisqa kuska kasqankuta.
Who was it.	Pitaq karqan.
He wasn’t supposed to be.	Payqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
He is a very busy man.	Payqa ancha ocupasqa runam.
He is happy about it.	Payqa kusisqam kachkan chaymanta.
If you don’t want to.	Mana munaspaqa.
No, it’s too big.	Manan, ancha hatun.
He wasn’t like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I didn’t know it.	Manam yacharqanichu.
I don't really want to do that.	Chaytaqa manam anchatachu ruwayta munani.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
You don’t know what it’s like here.	Mana yachankichu kaypi imayna kasqanmanta.
You have to do it right.	Allintam ruwanayki.
I hope we can do that.	Suyachkani chayta ruwanaykupaq.
No, no, not even.	Mana, mana, mana nitaq.
This thing is.	Kay imapas.
You knew that.	Chaytaqa yacharqanki.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
Who knows why he didn’t.	¿Pitaq yachan imanasqa mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He knew what he was going to do today.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan p’unchay ima ruwananta.
He knew it wasn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kasqanmanta.
I think that’s going to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanqa nispan yuyaykuni.
He’s obviously not sure.	Sut’inmi mana segurochu kashan.
He was, after all, a man now.	Payqa, tukuy imamanta, kunan runa karqa.
Otherwise I wouldn’t do it.	Mana chayqa manan ruwaymanchu.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
No one seems to know what that could have been.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu imachus chay kanman karqan chayta.
Actually, it’s better.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan allinmi.
We are very much.	Anchatam kanchik.
It would have been wonderful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanman karqa.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
You can’t do that anymore.	Chaytaqa manañan ruwayta atiwaqchu.
Not like before.	Mana ñawpaq hinachu.
Like last night.	Qayna tuta hina.
Not really sure.	Mana chiqap segurochu.
But it wasn’t very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu karqan.
He was alone in his very big house.	Ancha hatun wasinpi sapallan kasqa.
Maybe a little bit.	Ichapas huk chikan.
They’re probably.	Paykunaqa ichapas.
But he seemed very happy.	Ichaqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
Another bad thing.	Huk mana allin ruway.
Not quite, really.	Mana allintachu, chiqaptapuni.
But something else about that.	Ichaqa huk imapas chaymantaqa.
But it seemed fine at the time.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
It has never been easier.	Manam haykapipas aswan facilchu karqa.
If he was very angry.	Sichus ancha phiñasqa karqan chayqa.
I’m excited about that too.	Ñuqapas chaymantaqa kusisqam kachkani.
However, this is not always such a success.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina allin ruwayqa.
Now about that.	Kunanqa chaymanta.
Everything seemed fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa.
It should do everything you want it to do.	Tukuy ima munasqaykita ruwanan tiyan.
Maybe he really likes it.	Ichapas payqa anchata gustan.
It can be pretty difficult.	Allin sasa kanman.
I don’t know, but maybe you do.	Manam yachanichu, ichaqa ichapas yachanki.
But who knows.	Ichaqa pitaq yachan.
But it wasn’t good enough.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kasqa.
He’s anything though.	Payqa imapas ichaqa.
I didn't think that was the case.	Manam chayna kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu.
I thought he would.	Yuyarqanim chayna ruwananta.
They are very good.	Ancha allinmi kanku.
They’re worried about it.	Paykunaqa chaymanta llakisqa kachkanku.
It’s not easy, this is for sure.	Manam facilchu, kayqa segurom.
No one was sure what was going on.	Manam pipas segurochu karqa imakuna kasqanmantaqa.
But maybe that was a good thing.	Ichaqa ichapas chayqa allin karqa.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
As always, alone.	Sapa kuti hina, sapallan.
Well, you can't.	Allinmi, manam atiwaqchu.
This was a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi karqa.
It wasn’t always like that.	Manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I think that’s a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi nispan yuyaykuni.
However, the process would not take much longer.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa aswan unaytachu kanman.
But then there is never.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan hayk’aqpas kanchu.
He shouldn't be here.	Payqa manam kaypichu kanan.
But I’m good at it.	Ichaqa allinmi kani chaypi.
I don’t want that for you.	Manam chaytaqa munanichu qampaq.
It looks like this.	Rikchakun kay hina.
Maybe he's injured.	Ichapas k'irisqa kachkan.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu.
Very reluctant for him to do so.	Ancha mana munanchu payqa chayta ruwananpaq.
It's like one after another after another.	Hukmanta hukmanta hukmanta hinam.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
But he knew that was not the case.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana chhayna kasqanmanta.
He didn't know how to deal with this.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu kayta imayna atipananta.
He took it seriously.	Chaytaqa allintan qhawarirqan.
Never, maybe.	Mana hayk’aqpas, ichapas.
I could never say that.	Manam haykapipas chayta niyta atirqanichu.
That would be nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman.
Maybe it was the worst part.	Ichapas aswan mana allin kaq karqa.
He did everything he said he would do.	Payqa tukuy ima nisqanman hinam ruwarqa.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
No, please don’t.	Manan, ama hina kaspa.
He knows where he is.	Payqa yachan maypi kasqanmanta.
Beautiful, as always.	Sumaq, sapa kuti hina.
Then things got really good.	Chaymantaqa imapas ancha allinmi karqa.
Maybe it meant something.	Ichapas imapas niyta munarqa.
I'm not sure.	Manam segurochu kani.
Yes, he said yes.	Arí, payqa arí nisqa.
But that wasn’t the case, not quite.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan, manan allintachu.
He looked sad, he looked sad.	Payqa llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa, llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
He was home for a week.	Payqa huk semanan wasinpi kasharqan.
That is always the hardest part.	Chayqa sapa kutim aswan sasa ruwayqa.
He wanted it very much.	Payqa anchatan munarqan.
He is a .	Payqa huk .
No, he doesn’t.	Manan, payqa manan.
In fact, they already are.	Chiqaptaqa, ñam chayna kachkanku.

But you need to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanayki.
He was not like the old man.	Payqa manan ñawpaq runa hinachu karqan.
Yes, it should be.	Arí, chayna kanan tiyan.
Please share this with me.	Ama hina kaspa, kayta willay.
It was obviously massive.	Sut’inmi karqan hatun hatun kashasqanmanta.
You want to know, okay.	Yachayta munanki, allinmi.

What is the probability of that? 	¿Imaynataq chay kanman?

They are probably the same.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanku.
No, of course you do.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwanki.

It does a lot of things.	Anchatam ruwan.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
I know you are doing better.	Yachanim aswan allinta ruwasqaykita.
He was scared now.	Payqa kunanmi mancharisqa.
I'm not so sure it will.	Manam chayna segurochu kani chayna kananta.
It looks very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
He didn’t want to be here.	Payqa manan kaypi kayta munarqanchu.
There is no certainty here.	Kaypiqa manam segurochu.
If not, it’s fine .	Mana chayqa, allinmi .

There is nothing here.	Manam imapas kaypichu kachkan.
To do what you don’t want to do.	Mana munasqaykita ruwanaykipaq.

He was a nice guy.	Payqa sumaq runam karqa.
About thirty times more.	Yaqa kimsa chunka kuti aswan achka.

They’re the ones who don’t.	Paykunaqa chay mana.
It was wonderful to be with him again.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa hukmanta paywan kayqa.

But one day he will!.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi ruwanqa!.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
It’s more beautiful.	Aswan sumaqmi.
No one is really happy.	Mana pipas chiqap kusisqachu.
You are a beautiful person.	Sumaq runam kanki.
Maybe it was that good.	Ichapas chayna allin karqa.
But it’s better than nothing.	Ichaqa mana imamantapas aswan allinmi.
But he didn’t really do it.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu ruwarqan.
He always looked pretty good.	Payqa sapa kutim allin allin rikchakurqa.
It doesn’t matter anymore.	Manañam imananpaschu.
But this is really the first.	Ichaqa kayqa cheqaqtapunin ñawpaq kaq.
It doesn’t need much.	Manam anchatachu necesitan.
Maybe he did just that.	Ichapas payqa chayta ruwarqa.
If you’re good, you’re good.	Sichus allin kanki chayqa, allinmi kanki.
He couldn’t speak.	Payqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
I mean, it’s right.	Allintam niyta munani.
It will be unique to you.	Chayqa qampaq sapallan kanqa.
If you really want to know.	Sichus chiqaptapuni yachayta munanki.
That’s probably it.	Chayqa yaqapaschá.
I know it’s going to happen.	Yachanim chayna kananta.
He wasn't very good, and he knew it.	Payqa manan ancha allinchu karqan, chaytaqa yacharqanmi.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
Someone will be there.	Pipas chaypi kanqa.
I knew he could be fast.	Yacharqanim utqaylla kayta atisqanmanta.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
But how do you do it.	Ichaqa imaynatataq ruway.
Maybe you know something.	Ichapas imatapas yachanki.
You do everything on your own.	Tukuy imatam sapallayki ruwanki.
You can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manan atiwaqchu.
Yes, two years.	Arí, iskay wata.
He’s better than that.	Payqa chaymanta aswan allinmi.
He had to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ruwanan karqan.
Can you do it.	¿Atiwaqchu.
That, after all, is what it is.	Chayqa, tukuy imamanta, chayna kasqanmanta.
I would like to.	Munaymanmi.
Today was a very special day.	Kunan punchawqa ancha hatun punchawmi karqa.
That was the worst part.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
I know really well.	Chiqaptam allinta yachani.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He couldn't be sure.	Payqa manan seguro kayta atirqanchu.
It wouldn’t be right on my part.	Mana allinchu kanman ñuqamanta.

Which is great.	Imataq hatun.
There never is, really.	Manam haykapipas kanchu, chiqaptaqa.

It’s not that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu.
I had never seen him before that night.	Mana hayk’aqpas chay tuta ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu.
That’s what I wanted to do again.	Chayqa hukmanta ruwayta munarqani.
I don't think you'll ever do that.	Manam haykapipas chayta ruwanaykipaqqa piensanichu.
No one seems to know why.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu imarayku chaytaqa.
He doesn’t want to.	Payqa manam munanchu.
But it was very interesting.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He still wasn't sure.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kasqa.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
No, that’s not going to work.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
That will be tomorrow.	Chayqa paqarinmi kanqa.
I hope it comes soon.	Suyachkani utqaylla hamunanta.
This was a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi karqa.
Such an approach is not unique.	Chayna ruwayqa manam sapallanchu.
It’s not a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu.
But maybe that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
I was sure of that.	Chaymantaqa segurom karqani.
I was really excited.	Chiqaptam kusisqa karqani.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu.
I can’t tell you yet.	Manaraqmi willayta atinichu.
He is here every three days.	Payqa sapa kimsa punchawmi kaypi kachkan.
I don’t like doing anything.	Manam imatapas ruwayqa gustanchu.
Yeah, okay, sure.	Arí, allinmi, seguro.
I think that’s a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi nispan yuyaykuni.
I thought it was great.	Ñuqaqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensarqani.
But that won’t always be the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
That means you are really good.	Chayqa niyta munan chiqap allin kasqaykita.
The coffee was gone.	Chay kukata manaña kasqa.
Perhaps that was the case here.	Yaqapaschá kaypiqa chayna karqa.
He certainly said that.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta nirqan.
I know what to say.	Yachanim ima niyta.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
I am very happy here.	Kaypiqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.
You may not know that.	Manapaschá chaytaqa yachankichu.
But it wasn’t an easy task.	Ichaqa manan facilchu chay ruwayqa karqan.
Every day is a new day.	Sapa punchawmi musuq punchaw.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Describe whether it is correct or not.	Allinchu icha manachu chayta willay.
He was a bit early.	Payqa huk chhikantan temprano karqan.
He doesn’t really want that.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chaytaqa munan.
I doubt that is the case.	Iskayrayani chayna kasqanmanta.

But this wasn’t unique.	Ichaqa kayqa manan sapallanchu karqan.
You knew that’s it.	Chayta yacharqanki.

But he wasn’t alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu karqan.
This is fairly obvious.	Kayqa allin sut’inmi.

That doesn’t seem to be the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
Now he wants to talk.	Kunanqa rimayta munan.
That would never be a bad thing.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas huk mana allinchu kanman.
He looked very upset about something.	Payqa imamantapas anchata phiñasqa hinam rikchakurqa.
You were so beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi karqanki.
He was very sure.	Payqa ancha segurom karqa.
That is never a good thing.	Chayqa manam haykapipas allinchu.
He doesn't seem to want to talk.	Payqa manapaschá rimayta munanchu hina.
I hope it's not too bad.	Suyachkani mana ancha mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
He doesn’t know much about anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas anchatachu yachan.
Nobody cares anymore.	Manañam pipas imananpaschu.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqa.
One, one, one.	Huk, huk, huk.
He really wanted to be.	Payqa anchatan kayta munarqan.
It didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu karqa.
This is a unique one.	Kayqa sapallanmi.
It looks very interesting.	Ancha munaymanmi rikchakun.
Sure, that’s what he said.	Seguro, chaytan nisqa.
Other than that, you’ll be fine.	Huk chaymanta, allinmi kanki.
But he was such a man.	Ichaqa chayna runam karqa.
He was a really nice guy.	Payqa chiqap sumaq runam karqa.
I never thought of that.	Chaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanichu.
You will certainly do it.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwanki.
At home.	Wasinpi.
He was in a state of distress.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan.
The event went very well.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allintam rirqa.

It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
Maybe it will do well.	Ichapas allinta ruwanman.
He was a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam karqa.

You want to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwayta munanki.
I didn’t know what to do here.	Manam yacharqanichu kaypi imata ruwanayta.

That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
Nothing is unique here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas sapallanchu.
But they are still not sure.	Ichaqa manaraqmi segurochu kanku.
No one else though.	Mana pipas huk ichaqa.
But it’s beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I certainly did it.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwarqani.
He didn’t think about anything.	Payqa manan imapipas yuyaykurqanchu.
Sure, he was terrified.	Seguro, payqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
That’s a good thing though.	Chayqa allinmi ichaqa.
It could have been almost anything.	Yaqa imapas kanman karqa.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
Too much, too good.	Ancha achka, ancha allin.
I didn’t want to do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwayta munarqanichu.

This can't be such a bad thing.	Kayqa manam chayna mana allinchu kanman.

But it wasn’t easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu karqan.
He declined to comment earlier.	Payqa manan ñawpaqtaqa rimayta munarqanchu.
I can’t be like that.	Manam chayna kayta atiymanchu.
I wanted to play more.	Astawan pukllayta munarqani.

It was like everything else.	Tukuy imapas hinam karqa.
No, maybe not the best.	Manan, ichapas mana aswan allinchu.
Nothing would be right.	Manan imapas allinchu kanman.
But someone had to do it.	Ichaqa pipas ruwanan karqan.
As usual, it’s.	Sapa kuti hina.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
Now he always seemed sad.	Kunanqa sapa kutim llakisqa hina karqa.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa.
This doesn't seem right.	Kayqa manam allinchu rikchakun.
I'm sorry.	Llakikuni.
That doesn’t mean that.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu.
There were many such.	Achka chayna karqa.
It’s not the worst.	Manan aswan mana allinchu.
He can’t do it.	Payqa manan atinchu.
I don’t want to make much of it.	Manam anchatachu chaymanta ruwayta munani.
Very nice, very nice.	Ancha sumaq, ancha sumaq.
He did things on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi imatapas ruwaq.
But he knows it well.	Ichaqa allintan chayta yachan.
He loves to work hard.	Payqa anchatam llamkayta munan.
There is no such thing here.	Kaypiqa manam kanchu.
He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manan atirqanchu.
I was in the past.	Ñawpaqtaqa karqani.
This is the worst.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi.
But this doesn’t seem right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu rikch’akun kayqa.
I didn’t see anything, really.	Mana imatapas rikurqanichu, chiqaptaqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
But it’s not anymore.	Ichaqa manañan.
However, this is not a very effective approach.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa ancha allinchu.
It was like that, he knew.	Chay hina kasqa, payqa yacharqanmi.
I know it’s good.	Yachanim allin kasqanmanta.
She didn't know what he was thinking.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima yuyaykusqanmanta.

But if it has to be, it has to be.	Ichaqa sichus chay hina kanan chayqa, chay hina kanan.
He wasn’t like anyone else.	Payqa manan huk hinachu karqan.
It’s actually quite interesting to do.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi ruwayqa.
You don’t have to do something you don’t have to do.	Manan mana ruwanaykipaq hinachu ruwanayki.
It was a good year!.	¡Allin wata karqan!.
In fact, the sooner you learn how to do it, the better.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan utqaylla chay ruwayta yachanki chayqa, aswan allinmi.
I doubt if it ever will be.	Iskayrayani sichus hayk’aqllapas kanqa chayta.
However, it wasn’t.	Ichaqa, manan chay hinachu karqan.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
If anything, it’s worse.	Sichus imapas kanman chayqa, aswan mana allinmi.
It was really nice.	Chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
Not if it’s.	Manam sichus.
It was like two years ago.	Iskay wata ñawpaq hinam karqa.
I mean, it’s okay .	Ñuqaqa, allinmi .
But he is alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi.
He was eager to learn more.	Payqa anchatam munarqa astawan yachayta.
I still think it is.	Kunankamapas chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
Not like a human being.	Mana runa hinachu.
This would not be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman.
I didn’t really want anything.	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas munarqanichu.
A good guy.	Allin runa.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
Where are you?.	Maypitaq kachkanki?.
He didn’t know it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu.
I plan to do that tomorrow.	Paqarin chayta ruwayta yuyaykuni.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
No one wants that to happen.	Manam pipas munanchu chayna kananta.
Clearly this was not the case.	Sut’inmi kashan mana chay hinachu karqan.
That wasn’t easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan.
I knew the consequences.	Yacharqanim chaymanta imakuna kananta.
They’re not here.	Manam kaypichu kachkanku.
I want to do it.	Ruwayta munani.
He’s not a good guy.	Payqa manam allinchu.
He was injured.	Payqa k’irisqa kasqa.
He seemed very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
I couldn’t not do it.	Manam mana ruwayta atirqanichu.
I don’t know what to say.	Manam yachanichu ima niyta.
He says yes to it.	Payqa arí nin.
No one here knows how to do it.	Kaypiqa manam pipas ruwayta yachanchu.
Now that’s a thing of the past.	Kunanqa chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
That’s what you need to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki.
He was the man.	Payqa chay runan karqan.
He doesn’t care about that.	Payqa manan chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
Not a human being.	Mana runa.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
That’s what he meant.	Chaytaqa niyta munarqa.
But it certainly didn’t work out.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana allinchu karqan.
He didn’t know why.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imarayku chayta.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
This was not an easy task.	Kayqa manam facilchu karqa.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmanta.
They are not good.	Mana allinchu kanku.
It wouldn’t be right.	Manan allinchu kanman.
Now is the reality.	Kunanmi chiqap kaq.

Everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
He is no longer available.	Kunanqa manañam kanchu.

Not alone, alone.	Mana sapallanchu, sapallan.
If it was good, great.	Sichus allin karqan chayqa, ancha allinmi.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It’s not safe.	Manam segurochu kachkan.
He wasn’t like that, though.	Payqa manan chay hinachu karqan, ichaqa.
Maybe it was too much.	Ichapas llumpay karqa.
I think that's a great thing.	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensani.
It went on for about a year.	Yaqa huk wata hinam chayna karqa.
But this is not easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kayqa.
Maybe, but probably not.	Ichapas, ichaqa manapaschá.
No one is happy, but no one can do anything about it.	Manan pipas kusisqachu, ichaqa manan pipas imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu.
I think that’s all he’ll do.	Chaylla ruwananta yuyaykuni.
I know it is not easy.	Yachanim mana facilchu kasqanmanta.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He is not alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu.
Many days, he said.	Achka punchawmi, nispa.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Never mind anything.	Mana hayk’aqpas imapas.
I really want to talk about this.	Kaymanta rimayta anchata munani.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
What else would be wrong?.	¿Imataq huk mana allin kanman?.
He was very angry.	Payqa sinchi phiñasqa kasharqan.
He looks a lot like her.	Payqa anchatam rikchakun.
Actually he did well.	Chiqaptaqa allintam ruwarqa.
It didn't look like much.	Manam anchatachu rikchakurqa.
It wouldn’t be right.	Manan allinchu kanman.
That would be more interesting.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi kanman.
Probably never.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
Very nicely said.	Ancha sumaq nisqa.
I suspect maybe you do.	Sospechani ichapas chayta ruwanki.
First, something was wrong.	Ñawpaqtaqa imapas mana allinmi karqa.

I'm not sure that's the case.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kasqanmanta.
No one can do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
He doesn’t know where he is.	Payqa manan yachanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
I know exactly what it is.	Allintam yachani ima kasqanmanta.
But the good thing.	Ichaqa allin kaq.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
He is not unhappy.	Payqa manan mana kusisqachu kashan.
I wasn’t happy to say the least.	Manam kusisqachu karqani niyta.
The biggest one? 	¿Hatun kaq?
He seemed genuinely concerned.	Payqa chiqap llakisqa hinam karqa.
I didn't think he would, no.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna ruwananta, manam.
Do it, please.	Ruway, ama hina kaspa.
Now it’s not.	Kunanqa manan.
He doesn't want to talk.	Payqa manam rimayta munanchu.
That’s what he did.	Chaytan payqa ruwarqan.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
All together now.	Tukuy kuska kunan.
He knows it well enough.	Payqa allintam yachan.
It’s a morning.	Huk paqarinmi.
Unlike the first one.	Mana ñawpaq kaq hinachu.
I was everything.	Ñuqaqa tukuy imapas karqani.
But maybe it was that good.	Ichaqa ichapas chayna allin karqa.
I don't know why that is.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmantaqa.
But it could be worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
This would be a good thing, but probably not.	Kayqa allinmi kanman, ichaqa manapaschá.
Then a week later.	Chaymanta huk semana.
Everyone is very good.	Lliwmi ancha allin kanku.
I never saw anything.	Manam haykapipas imatapas rikurqanichu.
No one knows what that is.	Manan pipas yachanchu imachus chay kasqanmantaqa.
But it’s still not good enough.	Ichaqa manaraqmi allinchu.
No, he couldn’t.	Manan, manan atirqanchu.
You know exactly what that is.	Allintam yachanki chay ima kasqanmanta.
It looks beautiful.	Sumaq rikchakun.
That’s the most interesting thing.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi.
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
I can’t be sure.	Manam segurochu kanman.
You weren’t there that long.	Mana chay unaytachu chaypi karqanki.
I just don’t know what.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imamanta.
It would be very useful.	Ancha allinmi kanman.
I hope something new comes along.	Suyachkani imapas musuq hamunanta.
He did a great job at it.	Payqa ancha allintam chaypi ruwarqa.
But not for too long.	Ichaqa ama llumpay unaytachu.
That doesn’t seem to be a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman hina.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Kaypiqa manam imapas mana allinchu.
I would be annoyed.	Ñuqaqa phiñasqa kayman.
You’re a good guy.	Qamqa allinmi kanki.
No, he’s not here.	Manan, payqa manan kaypichu kashan.
I will continue to do so.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwasaq.
Now this is .	Kunanqa kayta .
Make it act differently.	Huk hina ruwananpaq ruway.
But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.
Don't ever.	Ama hayk'aqpas.
Two weeks today.	Iskay semana kunan punchaw.
He's right that it won't be easy.	Payqa allintam nin mana facilchu kanqa nispa.
I highly doubt that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam iskayrayani.
This was a wonderful experience.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But he doesn’t seem unhappy.	Ichaqa manan mana kusisqachu rikch’akun.
It was supposed to be really nice.	Chiqap sumaqmi kanan karqa.
He knew where he was.	Payqa yacharqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta.
I'm happy with how it turned out, really.	Kusisqam kachkani imayna kasqanmanta, chiqaptapuni.
Which was a good thing.	Imataq allin karqa.
Actually, it was good.	Chiqaptaqa, allinmi karqa.
He was terrified.	Payqa sinchitan mancharisqa kasharqan.
I never saw it coming.	Manam haykapipas hamunanta rikurqanichu.
Otherwise, it’s not.	Mana chayqa, manan.
That wasn’t always to be, however.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu kanan karqan ichaqa.
But he can’t.	Ichaqa manan atinchu.
He was really worried.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin llakisqa kasharqan.
I couldn’t believe that.	Chaytaqa manan creeyta atirqanichu.
I hope it’s better now.	Suyachkani kunan aswan allin kananpaq.
Like a real person.	Chiqap runa hina.
He’d do something a bit different.	Payqa huk chikan imatapas ruwanman.
He did it right.	Payqa allintan chaytaqa ruwarqan.
That was very clear.	Chayqa ancha sut’inmi karqan.
He certainly would.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanman.
The process was a success.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqan.
I don't want to go now.	Kunanqa manam riyta munanichu.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
I really want to know.	Anchatam yachayta munani.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
Do the right thing.	Chayta ruway.
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	Ichapas, ichapas, ichapas.
That’s probably there.	Chayqa ichapas chaypi kachkan.
I know what you mean.	Yachanim imamanta rimayta munasqaykita.
I’m sorry something went wrong.	Pampachaykuway imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
I wasn’t happy at all.	Manam imapipas kusisqachu karqani.
I didn't know that.	Ñuqaqa manam chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
This would be a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinmi kanman.
It was like an inhuman being.	Mana runa hinam karqa.
This isn’t the best though.	Kayqa manan aswan allinchu ichaqa.
After all, he was a great guy.	Tukuy imamanta, payqa hatun runam karqa.
But everything was fine.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
He would never be the same again.	Payqa manañan hayk’aqpas chay hinachu kanman karqan.
Alright.	Allinmi.
This is going to be very interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi kanqa.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
Maybe not so well, but well.	Ichapas mana chayna allintachu, ichaqa allinta.
I’ll be the person.	Chay runam kasaq.
I don’t want that.	Chaytaqa manam munanichu.
Tell them you’re there.	Chaypi kasqaykita willay.
It was a good day.	Chayqa allin punchawmi karqa.
He didn’t mean it.	Payqa manan niyta munarqanchu.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
He is not happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kashan.
But this is not the case.	Ichaqa manan kayqa.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
If you want to.	Sichus munanki chayqa.
Nothing seemed amiss.	Manam imapas mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
I know they are there.	Yachanim chaypi kasqankuta.
But that wasn’t the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa allinchu karqan.
He was scared, now, a little scared.	Payqa mancharisqa, kunan, huk chhikanta mancharisqa.
He is a.	Payqa huk.
But it wasn’t really.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu karqan.
No it’s not good.	Manam manam allinchu.
I know you can do it.	Yachanim ruwayta atisqaykita.
Day the way you want it.	Punchaw imayna munasqaykita.
That went well enough.	Chayqa allintam rirqa.
that’s what he needs.	chaytan necesitan.
Probably someone else.	Yaqapaschá huk runa.
But you know that.	Ichaqa chaytan yachanki.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
He refused to help her.	Payqa manan yanapayta munarqanchu.
Do a good job please.	Allin llamkayta ruway ama hina kaspa.
He needs the money.	Qullqita necesitan.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
He wasn't quite sure.	Payqa manan allintachu seguro kasharqan.
I know you can do it.	Yachanim atisqaykita.
He had to do something about it.	Payqa chaymanta imatapas ruwanan karqan.
Everyone is married.	Lliwmi casarasqa kachkanku.
It was a very bad experience.	Ancha mana allinmi karqan.
I know what the truth is.	Yachanim ima chiqap kasqanmanta.
But he didn’t know about it.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan yacharqanchu.
No one knows everything.	Manan pipas tukuy imatapas yachanchu.
Everything was wonderful.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I can’t, I can’t, I can’t.	Manam atiymanchu, manam atiymanchu, manam atiymanchu.
He is a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi.
Yes, that’s a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi.
In fact, he was sure he would.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa segurom karqa chayna ruwananmanta.
What does that mean.	Imataq chay niyta munan.
That’s what it should be.	Chayqa kanan.
But I couldn’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atirqanichu.
Nothing, either.	Mana imapas, nitaq.
I always did that.	Sapa kutim chayta ruwaq kani.
New every year.	Sapa wata musuq.
I’m sorry about everything that’s happened.	Llakikuni tukuy imakuna pasasqanmanta.
What he’s done.	Ima ruwasqanmanta.
This isn’t your case.	Kayqa manan qanpa hinachu.
No, it’s not.	Manan, manan.
It just never seems to work out.	Chaylla mana hayk’aqpas allintachu ruwanman hina.
It means frequently.	Sapa kuti niyta munan.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqan.
Now, isn’t that interesting.	Kunanqa, ¿manachu chay sumaq.
But he wasn’t human.	Ichaqa manan runa hinachu karqan.
They are better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinmi kanku.
This is not easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu.
It’s beautiful.	Sumaqmi.
He was never alone.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas sapallanchu karqan.
No, that’s not a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu.
The sooner the better.	Aswan utqaylla aswan allin.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I’m really bad at it.	Chiqap mana allinchu kani chaypi.
He knows how to play.	Payqa pukllayta yachan.
We always did that.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwaq kayku.
But it could be worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
No one, really, was good.	Manam pipas, chiqaptaqa, allinchu karqa.
Okay, here it is now.	Allinmi, kaypi kunan kachkan.
That is still the case today.	Chayqa kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.
But that was a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi karqan.
I know this will work.	Yachanim kayqa allinta ruwananta.
It really couldn't be easier.	Chiqaptaqa manam aswan facilchu kanman.
But now everything was fine.	Ichaqa kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqan.
He was extremely excited.	Payqa sinchitan kusisqa kasharqan.
That would be better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
He didn’t really act on it.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chayman hina ruwarqan.
But that was a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi karqan.
Night after night everyone.	Tuta tuta tukuy runa.
But there is nothing, no one.	Ichaqa manan imapas kanchu, manan pipas.
But it won’t be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanqa.
Not much of anything.	Mana ancha imapas.
I don't care what it looks like.	Manam imananpaschu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
Where are you now?.	¿Maypitaq kunan kachkanki?.
I mean, he’s pretty cool.	Niyta munani, payqa ancha sumaqmi.
You’re not happy.	Mana kusisqachu kanki.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
He has to be here.	Payqa kaypi kanan tiyan.
It would be great insurance.	Hatun seguro kanman.
He never wanted to talk about it.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaymanta rimayta munarqanchu.
That’s something, all right.	Chayqa imapas, allinmi.
Everything is bad, bad, bad.	Tukuy imapas mana allin, mana allin, mana allin.
He probably had that.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá karqan.
He's probably with her.	Payqa yaqapaschá paywan kachkan.
He had to do it.	Payqa ruwanan karqan.
Clearly something was wrong.	Sut’inmi imapas mana allinchu kasqa.
But it’s not quite yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi allintachu.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kachkan.
You’re going to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwanki.
There, that’s better.	Chaypi, chayqa aswan allinmi.
Then the other two.	Chaymanta wakin iskay.
But this doesn’t seem right.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu rikch’akun.
I really want that.	Chaytaqa anchatam munani.
He is still there.	Payqa hinallam kachkan.
I thought it was actually great.	Yuyarqanim chiqaptaqa ancha allin kasqanmanta.
Someone had to do something.	Pipas imatapas ruwanan karqan.
He must be tired.	Payqa sayk’usqa kanan.
I hope it works for you.	Suyachkani qampaq allin kananpaq.
No, this was the worst.	Manan, kayqa aswan mana allinmi karqan.
How about here.	Imayna kaypi.
It was as bad as anything.	Imapas hinam mana allinchu karqa.
That’s what it’s going to be.	Chayqa kanqa.
That may not be a bad thing.	Chayqa manapaschá mana allinchu kanman.
I know, in fact, that it is not.	Yachanim, chiqaptaqa, mana chayna kasqanmanta.
What’s the answer?.	¿Imaynataq chaymanta?.
He knew how important it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi chay ruway ancha allin kasqanmanta.
Like, really really.	Imayna, chiqap chiqap.
He was going to do this job.	Payqa kay llamkayta ruwananpaqmi karqa.
I don’t know how to do this.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus kayta ruwanaypaq.
That’s what he wanted to do.	Chaytan payqa ruwayta munarqan.
Not sure what happened.	Mana segurochu imakuna pasasqanmanta.
Yes, it was a good one.	Arí, allinmi karqa.
This was yesterday.	Kayqa qayna punchawmi karqa.
I had barely thought of that.	Chaytaqa yaqapaschá yuyaykurqani.
Everything is fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
It probably doesn’t exist.	Manapaschá kanchu.
Everything is wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allinchu.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
It was a tough three weeks.	Kimsa semanan sinchi sasa karqan.
I know what the truth is.	Yachanim ima chiqap kasqanmanta.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
He has never been happy yet.	Payqa manaraqmi haykapipas kusisqachu kachkan.
It really did, one day here.	Chiqaptam ruwarqa, huk punchaw kaypi.
Everything seems to never happen.	Tukuy imapas mana haykapipas kanman hinam.
It’s just like now.	Kunan hinallam.
He was in a state of distress.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan.
He wanted it, he wanted it.	Payqa munarqa, munarqa.
I can't say anything now.	Kunanqa manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu.
He doesn’t want to be good.	Payqa manam allin kayta munanchu.
It wouldn’t be that good.	Manan chay hina allinchu kanman.
I don’t know where.	Mana yachanichu maypi.
Of course, he knew nothing.	Arí, payqa manan imatapas yacharqanchu.
Very bad, actually.	Ancha mana allin, chiqaptaqa.
I didn't think it would happen.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kananta.
You’re right there.	Allinmi chaypi kanki.
He wants to do that.	Payqa chayta ruwayta munan.
He wanted everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam munarqa.
He was devastated and depressed.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa, llakisqa ima kasharqan.
Maybe that’s all.	Ichapas chaylla.
I was very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi karqani.
But it’s not like this.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu.
Yes, it would be.	Arí, chayna kanman.
I worry every day.	Sapa punchawmi llakikuni.
I'm not quite sure what that is about.	Manam allintachu yachani imamanta chay kasqanmantaqa.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munanichu.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
But I don't think this will work.	Ichaqa manan piensanichu kayqa allinta ruwananta.
That's pretty obvious.	Chayqa ancha sut'inmi.
I truly mean it.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta niyta munani.
It wasn’t very good.	Manam ancha allinchu karqa.
I know you are scared.	Yachanim mancharisqa kasqaykita.
I didn’t think this would happen.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kay pasananta.
That’s a good thing though.	Chayqa allinmi ichaqa.
You’re a human being.	Qamqa runam kanki.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
But he knew, he knew.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi, yacharqanmi.
I know what he thinks.	Yachanim ima piensasqanmanta.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kayqa.
Like every other year.	Sapa iskay wata hina.
There has to be time.	Tiempo kanan tiyan.
If someone doesn’t like me, that’s fine.	Sichus pipas mana gustawanchu chayqa, allinmi.
Obviously that didn’t matter.	Sut’inmi karqan chayqa manan imananpaschu.
Today was the worst.	Kunan punchawqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
This one is more difficult.	Kayqa aswan sasa.
A good one, yes.	Huk allin, arí.
That seemed too good to be true.	Chayqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa mana chiqap kananpaq.
Actually he was right.	Chiqaptaqa payqa allintam nirqa.
But it was beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi karqan.
He’s fast, very fast.	Payqa utqaylla, ancha utqaylla.
I don’t know if you can tell.	Mana yachanichu willayta atisqaykita.
Probably more than me.	Yaqapaschá ñuqamanta aswan achka.
Maybe he isn’t right.	Ichapas payqa mana allinchu kachkan.
I don’t, I can’t, do it.	Manam, mana atiymanchu, ruwayta.
No, it wasn’t good.	Manan, manan allinchu karqan.
I thought that was great.	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He wasn’t always like that.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
However, this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
He knew he wouldn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana ruwananta.
He is not happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kashan.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kasqa.
Perhaps he wanted to do that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwayta munarqan.
A difference of this, a difference of that.	Huk chikan kaymanta, huk chikan chaymanta.
It looks very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
He did it right.	Chaytaqa allintan ruwarqan.
He is here this morning.	Payqa kunan paqarinmi kaypi kachkan.
I just know that you are.	Chaylla yachani chayna kasqaykita.
It’s like you’re not here.	Mana kaypichu kanki hinam.
I think this is a good thing.	Kayqa allin kasqanmantam piensani.
That meant the next morning.	Chayqa paqarin paqarinmi niyta munarqa.
It looks very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
It was like a night.	Huk tuta hinam karqa.
He says he is busy.	Payqa ninmi ocupasqa kasqayta.
There is nothing like that.	Manan imapas chay hinachu.
You were really, really nice.	Chiqap, chiqap sumaqmi karqanki.
The	Chay .
I like it a lot.	Anchatam gustan.
Another great first.	Huk hatun ñawpaq.
Almost everything else.	Yaqa tukuy imamanta.
He did it all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwarqa.
I never knew that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
Hopefully it would have been good.	Munaymanmi allin kanman karqan.
It enhances your personality.	Chayqa aswan allintan ruwan imayna runa kasqaykita.
You'll do well, well.	Allintam ruwanki, allinta.
He can’t be here for long.	Payqa manan unaytachu kaypi kanman.
This seems to be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi rikchakun.
We are human beings.	Runa kanchik.
He certainly wasn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu karqan.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
I loved it so much.	Anchatam munarqani.
The second one.	Chay iskay kaq.
I wonder what’s wrong.	Imataq mana allin kasqanmanta tapukuni.
I never thought it would be that hard.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna sasa kananta.
But how lonely.	Ichaqa imayna sapallan.
I can’t do it.	Manam atiymanchu.
He is still there.	Payqa hinallam kachkan.
Probably, he never could.	Yaqapaschá, mana hayk’aqpas atirqanchu.
I'm still not sure it's right.	Hinallam mana segurochu kani allin kasqanmanta.
You know what you have to do.	Yachanki ima ruwanaykita.
I probably wouldn’t do that.	Manapaschá chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
He was obviously nervous.	Payqa sut’inmi mancharisqa kasharqan.
Very great indeed.	Ancha hatun chiqap.
I didn’t know that.	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu.
She realized what he was thinking.	Payqa repararqanmi ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
No one is sure.	Manan pipas segurochu.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kayqa.
He knew he had to do something.	Payqa yacharqanmi imatapas ruwananta.
I mean, it's not good.	Mana allintam niyta munani.
In fact, it probably was.	Chiqaptaqa, yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
Not like before.	Mana ñawpaq hinachu.
I’m afraid of everything.	Tukuy imatam manchakuni.
I wonder what he thinks.	Tapukunitaqmi ima piensasqanmanta.
Yes, something was wrong.	Arí, imapas mana allinchu karqa.
This he can never do here.	Kaytaqa manan hayk’aqpas kaypiqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
He was in a hurry.	Payqa usqhayllan kasharqan.
But something was wrong.	Ichaqa imapas mana allinmi karqa.
They are always very fast.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim ancha utqaylla kanku.
They are beautiful, everything is beautiful.	Paykunaqa sumaqmi, tukuy imapas sumaqmi.
Before, he was no longer alone.	Ñawpaqtaqa manañam sapallanchu karqa.
All right, right.	Tukuy allin.
I can’t be with you.	Manan qanwan kayta atiymanchu.
He really was something.	Payqa chiqaptam imapas karqa.
That was the worst part.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
Nothing, nothing .	Mana imapas, mana imapas .
Everything is good about it.	Tukuy imapas allinmi chaymanta.
That was the only thing that happened.	Chayqa hinallam karqa.
I am a busy person.	Ocupasqa runam kani.
He didn’t know, he wasn’t sure.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu, manan segurochu karqan.
I was really excited.	Chiqaptam kusisqa karqani.
Very, very happy about it.	Ancha, ancha kusisqa chaymanta.
Just about anything with you a lot.	Yaqa imapas qamwan achka.
The success is uncertain.	Chay allin ruwayqa mana segurochu.
He wasn’t quite right.	Payqa manan allintachu karqan.
No one seemed to be like that.	Manam pipas chayna hinachu karqa.
He did it alone.	Chaytaqa sapallanmi ruwarqa.
You're never sure.	Manam haykapipas segurochu kanki.
Very happy indeed.	Ancha kusisqa chiqap.
It was such a time.	Chay hina tiempon karqan.
But it was like nothing.	Ichaqa mana imapas hinam karqa.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
I couldn’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu.
It can be every week.	Sapa semanan kanman.
I want more and more.	Aswan achkatam munani.
I can’t get over that.	Chaytaqa manam atipayta atiymanchu.
He didn’t want anything.	Payqa manan imatapas munarqanchu.
Very happy, actually.	Ancha kusisqa, chiqaptaqa.
Maybe it was the case.	Ichapas chayna karqa.
But things are not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu imapas.
There with you.	Chaypi qanwan kuska.
That’s probably not the case.	Chayqa manapaschá.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I don’t know if that’s the case.	Mana yachanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
Maybe it’s a little different.	Ichapas huk chikan kanman.
Indeed, he did.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
I was happy!.	¡Kusisqam karqani!.
What do you think of it.	Imatataq yuyanki.
Everyone is here.	Lliwmi kaypi kachkan.
It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
No, he couldn’t.	Manan, payqa manan atirqanchu.
You didn’t know it.	Manam yacharqankichu.
Something wasn’t right.	Imapas manam allinchu karqa.
He’s been here a long time.	Payqa unayñan kaypi kashan.
But he kept saying it.	Ichaqa hinallam nirqa.
You are very very beautiful.	Ancha ancha sumaqmi kanki.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
He really wanted her to be successful.	Payqa anchatan munarqan allin kananpaq.
But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
More often than not.	Aswan sapa kuti.
It looks good.	Allinmi rikchakun.
I don’t mean much.	Manam anchatachu niyta munani.
But they are not unhappy.	Ichaqa manan mana kusisqachu kanku.
Good night, now.	Allin tuta, kunan.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
Maybe he’s scared.	Ichapas payqa mancharisqa kachkan.
It’s available all day.	Tukuy punchawmi kachkan.
He was in the morning.	Payqa paqarinmi karqa.
It wouldn’t be right.	Manan allinchu kanman.
I don’t think so.	Manam yuyanichu.
He told me that today.	Chaytaqa kunan punchawmi niwarqa.
I’ve wanted to do that for a long time.	Chaytaqa unayñan ruwayta munarqani.
I know that to be true.	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam yachani.
But it wasn’t going to work out.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanan karqan.
Not sure what it looks like yet.	Manaraqmi segurochu imayna kasqanmanta.
He says there is nothing.	Payqa ninmi mana imapas kasqanmanta.
If anything he was the nicest.	Sichus imapas payqa aswan sumaqmi karqan.
He must act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ruwanan.
Really fast.	Chiqap utqaylla.
But you do it now.	Ichaqa kunanmi ruwanki.
He had no idea how he was going to do it.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imayna ruwananta.
It depends on a lot of things.	Chayqa achka ima kasqanmantam.
It just doesn’t get any easier than that.	Chaylla mana chaymanta aswan facilchu kanman.
Not sure how it is.	Mana segurochu imaynatachus chayta.
The second worst.	Iskay kaq aswan mana allin.
It’s actually worse than that.	Chiqaptaqa chaymanta aswan mana allinmi.
I’ve never seen it before.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
I am happier than ever.	Aswan kusisqam kachkani.
I still know where he is.	Kunankamapas yachanim maypi kasqanmanta.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi.
Very bad for you.	Ancha mana allin qampaq.
I did that every week.	Chaytaqa sapa semanan ruwaq kani.
This is not going to be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanqa.
I'm not sure why that would be.	Manam segurochu kani imarayku chayna kanman.
Like new.	Musuq hina.
Second, third, .	Iskay kaq, kimsa kaq, .
He wanted to know what he was going to do.	Ima ruwananta yachayta munarqa.
I can’t be happy.	Manam kusisqa kayta atiymanchu.
We are very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kanchik.
No one ever thought of doing that.	Manan pipas chayta ruwananpaqqa hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu.
Today, however, it is not.	Kunan punchawmi ichaqa mana.
Yeah, that’s pretty cool.	Arí, chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
But you’re fine.	Ichaqa allinmi kanki.
I have to get the action right.	Ruwayta allinta ruwanay tiyan.
I didn’t know why.	Manam yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
I don’t know about that.	Manam chaymantaqa yachanichu.
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
That was supposed to be.	Chayqa kanan karqan.
He didn’t want to go.	Payqa manan riyta munarqanchu.
I’m glad he’s here.	Kusikuni kaypi kasqanmanta.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
That it never existed.	Mana hayk’aqpas kasqanmanta.
But obviously, that wasn’t the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kashan, manan chay hinachu karqan.
He knew what was involved.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaypi imakuna kasqanmanta.
Now the good thing.	Kunanqa allin kaq.
But you need to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanayki.
Maybe that’s all.	Ichapas chaylla.
He looked lonely.	Payqa sapallanmi rikchakurqa.
Maybe that’s what it means.	Ichapas chayta niyta munan.
It wouldn’t be right.	Manam allinchu kanman.
Actually, it’s pretty cool.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha sumaqmi.
I know you are really busy.	Yachanim chiqaptapuni ocupasqa kasqaykita.
This is actually a good thing.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa allinmi.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
However, it is better than nothing.	Ichaqa, mana imamantapas aswan allinmi.
Yes, he couldn’t.	Arí, manan atirqanchu.
He knew he was right.	Payqa yacharqanmi allin kasqanmanta.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He was supposed to be happy.	Payqa kusisqa kanan karqan.
He must continue to exist.	Payqa hinallam kanan.
But then, it fails.	Ichaqa chaymanta, mana allintachu ruwan.
Yes, yes, yes.	Arí, arí, arí.
How can this be?.	¿Imaynataq kay kanman?.
But now it wasn’t right.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan allinchu karqan.
He's really excited.	Payqa chiqaptam ancha kusisqa kachkan.
He was obviously excited.	Payqa sut’inmi kusisqa kasharqan.
He refused to talk for a week.	Payqa huk semanan mana rimayta munarqanchu.
But it can’t be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanman chay ruwayqa.
One by one, one by one.	Hukmanta hukmanta.
Yeah, it’s okay, it’s okay.	Arí, allinmi, allinmi.
It may not mean anything.	Manapaschá imatapas niyta munanchu.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
But he didn't seem angry.	Ichaqa manan phiñasqa hinachu karqan.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kasqa.
It was nothing like the first one.	Chayqa manan imapas ñawpaq kaq hinachu karqan.
Not quite sure what to do though.	Mana allintachu yachani imata ruwanaypaq ichaqa.
He couldn’t figure out anything about it.	Payqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa yachayta atirqanchu.
Here he did very well.	Kaypi payqa ancha allintam ruwarqa.
There is nothing here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas kanchu.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
Maybe he’s the one.	Ichapas payqa.
Be happy together.	Kuska kusisqa kay.
He didn’t think about that.	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu.
I’m busy here.	Kaypiqa ocupasqa kachkani.
I think he’s tired.	Sayk’usqa kashasqanmanta yuyaykuni.
If you want to do it, do it.	Ruwayta munanki chayqa, ruway.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
I wish he was.	Munaymanmi payqa.
That would be really nice.	Chayqa chiqap sumaqmi kanman.
Probably not.	Manapaschá.
But of course it would.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwanman.
He doesn’t know how good he is.	Payqa manan yachanchu imayna allin kasqanmanta.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
I know enough to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi allinta yachani.
I never thought it would happen.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna kananta.
I don’t want him to be unhappy.	Manam munanichu mana kusisqa kananta.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
He never could .	Payqa manan hayk'aqpas atirqanchu.
I was good at it.	Allinmi karqani chaypi.
I don’t want to be sad.	Manam munanichu llakisqa kayta.
It's like it never existed.	Mana hayk'aqpas karqan hinan.
I'll be fine.	Allinmi kasaq.
I know how to play the game.	Pukllayta yachani.
Something bad, something beautiful.	Imapas mana allin, imapas sumaq.
I really don’t know.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I want to tell you.	Willayta munani.
You knew that, you knew it early on.	Chaytaqa yacharqanki, ñawpaqmantaraqmi yacharqanki.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.
The bad guy.	Mana allin runa.
Too much time.	Llumpay tiempo.
I want to know more about this.	Kaymanta astawan yachayta munani.
I’m not waiting that long.	Manam chay unaytachu suyachkani.
Everything is just how it is.	Tukuy imapas chaylla imayna kasqanmanta.
Everything was wonderful.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He wasn’t alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu karqa.
A little angry.	Huk chikan phiñasqa.
Not quite sure.	Mana allintachu seguro.
I’m a good guy.	Allin runam kani.
Man, you know that.	Runa, chayta yachanki.
That, however, does not seem to be the case.	Chayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
Okay, okay, very good.	Allinmi, allinmi, ancha allinmi.
That was yesterday, this is today.	Chayqa qayna punchawmi karqa, kayqa kunan punchawmi.
But it’s not anymore.	Ichaqa manañan.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinmi karqa.
He doesn’t know.	Payqa manam yachanchu.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kasqanmantaqa.
However, this process is not always so simple.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina facilchu.
But he didn’t want that.	Ichaqa chaytaqa manan munarqanchu.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
One day, he succeeded.	Huk punchawmi, payqa allinta ruwarqa.
You never know!.	¡Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu!.
They are not happy.	Paykunaqa manam kusisqachu kanku.
He’s that good.	Payqa chayna allinmi.
He thought he would.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta ruwananta.
He probably didn't care.	Payqa manapaschá imananpaschu karqan.
I'll be fine.	Allinmi kasaq.
No one cares about it.	Manan pipas imananpaschu.
But he is .	Ichaqa payqa .
It’s really important.	Chiqaptam ancha allin.
I’m sure he’ll do well.	Seguro kani allinta ruwananmanta.
I couldn’t do that now.	Manam kunanqa chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
Now he had to act quickly.	Kunanqa usqhayllan ruwanan karqan.
But then it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan imananpaschu.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
I’m very good at it.	Ñuqaqa ancha allinmi kani chaypi.
Surely he would have.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa chayta ruwanman karqan.
He always did it.	Payqa sapa kutim ruwarqa.
Two years, more.	Iskay wata, astawan.
Obviously I don’t want to do this.	Sut’inmi mana kayta ruwayta munanichu.
He said it wasn't.	Payqa mana chayna kasqanmanta nirqa.
. . . .	.
It’s today.	Kunan punchawmi.
A few days.	Iskay kimsa punchaw.
That would have been a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman karqa.
It was the second time that morning.	Chay paqarinmi iskay kaq kuti karqa.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
You think you are great things.	Hatun imakuna kasqaykita yuyanki.
You can’t predict that.	Chaytaqa manan willayta atiwaqchu.
He was happy and happy.	Payqa kusisqa kusisqa kasharqan.

That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
I know what he can do.	Yachanim ima ruway atisqanmanta.
He has to do the right thing.	Payqa allintam ruwanan.
It’s good enough for you.	Allinmi qampaq hina.
It’s actually good.	Chiqaptaqa allinmi.
It would be a good idea to do so.	Allinmi kanman chayta ruwayqa.
She knew what he was thinking.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus yuyaykusqanmanta.
. . . .	.
But it doesn’t make it as effective as coffee.	Ichaqa manan kukata hinachu aswan allinta ruwan.
But he is happier alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi aswan kusisqa.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
Why is that the case?.	¿Imanasqataq chayna kanman?.
Man, he was beautiful.	Runa, payqa sumaqmi karqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqan.
That’s what he does.	Chaytan payqa ruwan.

I'm pretty sure this is it.	Yaqa segurom kani kay kasqanmanta.
I want to know.	Yachayta munani.
But I couldn’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atirqanichu.
They don’t care.	Paykunaqa manan imananpaschu.
I wonder what caused it.	Imataq chayta ruwarqa nispa tapukuni.
He is doing it well.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwachkan.
Now he just did it.	Kunanqa chaylla ruwarqa.
He does it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwan.
Things are much better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinmi imapas kachkan.
But that may not be the case.	Ichaqa chayqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
You want to buy it.	Chaytaqa rantiyta munanki.
One day he did it.	Huk punchawmi chayta ruwarqa.
He couldn’t know that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa yachayta atirqanchu.
He seems really sad.	Chiqap llakisqa hinam kachkan.
That’s all.	Chaylla.
It was always like that.	Sapa kutim chayna karqa.
You knew you couldn’t.	Yacharqanki mana atisqaykita.
This would be interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi kanman.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allintam.
I am very sorry about that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni.
I don’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munanichu.
I don’t know what it’s like.	Manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
If you think about this, that’s fine.	Kaypi yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.

That’s between you and me.	Chayqa qamwan ñuqawan.

Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
Something wrong there.	Imapas mana allin chaypi.
He knew he had to do something.	Payqa yacharqanmi imatapas ruwanan kasqanmanta.
But this was a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi karqa.

He knew he didn't want to.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana munasqanmanta.
He looked very good.	Payqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
. . . .	.
He did it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwarqa.
It will do that.	Chayta ruwanqa.
Maybe he knows.	Ichapas payqa yachan.
He never exists.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kanchu.
I didn’t want to know anything.	Manam imatapas yachayta munarqanichu.
But it’s fine if you don’t.	Ichaqa allinmi mana chayta ruwanki chayqa.

I know you’re doing the right thing.	Yachanim allinta ruwasqaykita.
He is doing it well.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwachkan.
You can’t do anything about it.	Manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.

You couldn't say why.	Manam niyta atiwaqchu karqa imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.

He is badly injured.	Payqa sinchitan k’irisqa kashan.

That was too bad.	Chayqa sinchi mana allinchu karqan.
However, this approach is not very effective.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa mana ancha allinchu.
I didn’t want it to happen again.	Manam munarqanichu hukmanta chay pasananta.
Faster, faster, faster.	Aswan utqaylla, aswan utqaylla, aswan utqaylla.

It’s not the best, but it will do just fine.	Manan aswan allinchu, ichaqa allintan ruwanqa.

It doesn’t seem right.	Mana allinchu rikchakun.
I certainly did my best.	Cheqaqtapunin tukuy atisqayta ruwarqani.
It’s always there.	Sapa kutim chaypi kachkan.

All by yourself.	Tukuy sapallayki.
He had to do something.	Imatapas ruwanan karqan.
I didn’t want to.	Manam munarqanichu.
But I refuse to believe that this is the case.	Ichaqa manan creeyta munanichu kay hina kasqanmanta.
It was really, really great.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam hatun karqa.
He is alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kachkan.
But he knew it.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi.
Now I wasn’t sure about that.	Kunanqa manañan chaymantaqa segurochu karqani.
I wish he wouldn’t do anything.	Munaymanmi mana imatapas ruwananta.
There was no better way to do that.	Chaytaqa manan aswan allinchu karqan.

Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa.
You can’t tell anyone.	Manan pimanpas willayta atiwaqchu.

All right, good night.	Allinmi, allin tuta.

Being human is very difficult.	Runa kayqa ancha sasa.
He can’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atinchu.
It was a beautiful day.	Sumaq punchawmi karqa.
I didn’t want to buy it, either.	Manam rantiyta munarqanichu, nitaq.

Indeed, he probably was.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa yaqapaschá karqan.

I wanted to know everything.	Tukuy imatam yachayta munarqani.

Maybe there are more.	Ichapas aswan achka kanman.
No, that’s not a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu.

Everything would be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanman.
He was not quite at home.	Payqa manan allintachu wasinpi kasharqan.
It’s been about two days.	Yaqa iskay punchawmi.

But he wasn't sure he could do it.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kasharqan chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
I mean, nobody.	Niyta munani, mana pipas.
Does anyone know why? 	¿Pipas yachanchu imarayku?
I couldn’t do it.	Manam ruwayta atirqanichu.

It would be very useful.	Ancha allinmi kanman.
It was a man.	Runa kasqa.
He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam karqa.
Maybe the second one.	Ichapas iskay kaq.
A little bit of reality.	Huk chikan chiqap kaq.
He couldn’t do anything about it.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
That was the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allinmi karqa.

Maybe he doesn’t want to.	Ichapas mana munanchu.
There are never two things you can do.	Manam haykapipas iskay ruwayqa kanchu.
That’s what he did, though.	Chaytan ichaqa ruwarqan.
Everything I have to do.	Tukuy ima ruwanay tiyan.
That action wasn’t here, though.	Chay ruwayqa manan kaypichu karqan, ichaqa.
He probably likes it.	Payqa yaqapaschá gustan.
But it was quick.	Ichaqa usqhayllan karqan.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
Someone is doing it.	Pipas chayta ruwachkan.

They are quick good.	Paykunaqa utqaylla allinmi.

That’s still the case.	Chayqa hinallam kachkan.

But he knew he would, someday.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwananta, hayk’aqllapas.

If you want to do it, do it.	Sichus ruwayta munanki chayqa, ruway.
Other than that, it should be fine.	Mana chaymantaqa, allinmi kanan.

It wasn’t a good thing.	Mana allinchu karqa.
That’s not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanqa.
Being a human being.	Runa kay.
It was almost uncomfortable sometimes.	Yaqa mana allinchu karqan wakin kuti.
He did something about it.	Payqa imatapas ruwarqa.
But it’s not the easiest thing to do.	Ichaqa manan aswan facilchu chay ruwayqa.
He had no idea where he was.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu maypi kasqanmanta.
I don’t know why anyone would be there.	Mana yachanichu imarayku pipas chaypi kanman.
But you have to do it accordingly.	Ichaqa chayman hinam ruwanayki.
That was probably the case.	Chayqa yaqapaschá karqan.
No one knows what this is.	Imataq kay kasqanmantaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
Now, it’s better.	Kunanqa, aswan allinmi.
But something is wrong.	Ichaqa imapas mana allinchu kachkan.

I think everybody was scared.	Tukuy runa mancharisqa kasqankuta yuyani.

I don’t really know what to say.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imata niyta.
It’s very interesting here.	Kaypiqa ancha sumaqmi.

But it’s not like anything else.	Ichaqa manan huk hinachu.
I don’t like it.	Manam gustanchu.
He is always worried.	Payqa sapa kutim llakisqa kachkan.

It all wanted to go there.	Tukuy chayman riyta munarqa.
That didn’t matter, though.	Chayqa manan imananpaschu karqan, ichaqa.
Not at all though.	Manan ichaqa.
But nothing will go wrong.	Ichaqa manan imapas mana allinchu kanqa.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
It certainly can be.	Cheqaqtapunin kanman.
But he realized he was married.	Ichaqa repararqanmi casarasqa kashasqanmanta.
I know everything here.	Kaypi tukuy imata yachani.
He knew he wouldn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayta ruwananta.

They are indeed.	Cheqaqtapunin kanku.
But it is very good.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi.
Yesterday, really good performance.	Qayna punchaw, chiqap allin ruway.
You can't do that here.	Chaytaqa manam kaypiqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
You know exactly why he is here.	Qamqa allintam yachanki imanasqa kaypi kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want to do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta munarqanichu.
He didn’t want to play with her.	Payqa manan paywan pukllayta munarqanchu.
This would be a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu kanman.
Not yet, maybe never.	Manaraqmi, ichapas mana haykapipas.
That would really do it.	Chayqa chiqaptam ruwanman.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.

But it was good.	Ichaqa allinmi kasqa.
He wanted to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwayta munarqa.
He is not sure.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan.
Like the real thing.	Chiqap kaq hina.
But, it’s not.	Ichaqa, manañam.
Maybe it’s something else.	Ichapas huk imapas kanman.
It said something about his personality.	Chayqa imatapas nirqam imayna runa kasqanmanta.
I think it’s a good thing.	Allinmi kashasqanmanta yuyaykuni.
I want someone.	Pitapas munani.
I'll be fine.	Allinmi kasaq.
But perhaps he was on to something.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá imapipas kasharqan.
Have a nice day!.	Qampaq allin punchaw!.
It wouldn’t be right.	Manan allinchu kanman.
Here’s the first one.	Kaypi ñawpaq kaq.

He didn’t know where he was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
I know that is not true.	Yachanim chay mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
Why would he do that?.	¿Imanasqataq chayta ruwanman?.
He can’t do it.	Manan ruwayta atinchu.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
Okay, maybe not.	Allinmi, ichapas mana.
But no one knew.	Ichaqa manan pipas yacharqanchu.
There may be three.	Kimsa kanman.
In the morning.	Kusikuni.
I wonder what he’s thinking.	Tapukuni ima yuyaykusqanmanta.
Maybe too soon.	Ichapas ancha utqaylla.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
He wanted to know everything about me.	Payqa tukuy imatam ñuqamanta yachayta munarqa.
No, that wasn’t a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
No, no, that you’re not.	Manan, manan, chay mana kasqaykita.

But obviously, it’s better not.	Ichaqa sut’inmi, aswan allinmi mana.

This would not be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman.
But it looked great.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
But he knew he could do better than that.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chaymanta aswan allinta ruwananta.
I know that he will.	Yachanim chayna ruwananta.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
It was a really great morning.	Chiqaptam hatun paqarin karqa.

I don't think it will happen.	Manam piensanichu chayna kananta.
He was almost angry.	Payqa yaqa phiñasqa kasqa.
This seems to be the case.	Kayqa kanman hinam.
But that’s what it does.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwan.
No, it was nothing of the sort.	Manan, manan imapas chay hinachu karqan.
One day, one day.	Huk punchaw, huk punchaw.
Everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I know it doesn't, not really.	Yachanim mana chayna kasqanmanta, manam chiqaptachu.

I'll be happy.	Kusisqam kasaq.
There was no way he could do that.	Manan imapipas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
I don’t want it anymore.	Manañam munanichu.
That probably doesn’t seem right though.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu rikch’akun ichaqa.
Maybe it was the time.	Ichapas chay tiempo karqa.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
A beautiful one.	Huk sumaq.
I’m sorry, you can’t be this.	Pampachaykuway, manam kayta atiwaqchu.

He looked nervous.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
I am really worried.	Chiqaptam llakisqa kachkani.
I know why that is.	Yachanim imanasqa chaytaqa.

He’s not yet.	Payqa manaraqmi.
That meant you were someone.	Chayqa niyta munarqa pipas kasqaykita.
I couldn’t really say.	Manam chiqaptaqa niyta atirqanichu.

Do something there.	Chaypi imatapas ruway.

Of course, he knew what he was thinking.	Arí, payqa yacharqanmi ima yuyaykusqanmanta.

Don’t be a bad guy.	Ama mana allinchu kay.

That’s what he wanted.	Chaytan payqa munarqan.
He was always very sure that he knew better.	Payqa sapa kutim ancha seguro karqa aswan allinta yachasqanmanta.
He couldn’t do it now.	Payqa manan kunanqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
He looked very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam rikchakurqa.
He knew it wouldn’t happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kananta.
She’s beautiful and good.	Payqa sumaqmi, allinmi.
No, no, it’s okay.	Manan, manan, allinmi.

That meant it.	Chayqa niyta munarqa.
But that is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chayqa kanchu.

But he was there.	Ichaqa chaypi kasharqan.
I am a very lonely person.	Ancha sapallan runam kani.

Then you do it.	Chaymantaqa ruwanki.
He adapted well.	Payqa allintan chayman hina ruwarqan.
But no one knows exactly how much is safer.	Ichaqa manan pipas allintachu yachan hayk’a aswan seguro kasqanmanta.

I'll be a man.	Runa kasaq.
He had to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
You can’t say it doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu niyta atiwaqchu.
How could he not.	Imaynataq mana atinmanchu karqa.
Everything remained the same.	Tukuy imapas hinallam karqa.

All right, he said.	Allinmi, nispa.
He is a depressed man.	Payqa llakisqa runam.
She was beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa.
You cannot tell this to anyone.	Kaytaqa manam pimanpas willayta atiwaqchu.
It looks new.	Musuq rikchakun.

But you can never tell.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas willayta atiwaqchu.
Maybe it’s something else.	Ichapas huk imapas kanman.
That is still the case today.	Chayqa kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.

It was obviously good.	Sut’inmi allin karqan.

Where is the wrong?.	¿Maypitaq mana allin?.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
They are angry and scared.	Paykunaqa phiñasqa, mancharisqa ima kachkanku.
He wanted to talk about it.	Payqa chaymanta rimayta munarqa.

But it can’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
But he was worried.	Ichaqa llakisqa kasharqan.
That’s nice, but it won’t work.	Chayqa sumaqmi, ichaqa manan allinchu kanqa.
He was very nice to me.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqawan karqa.

They’re tough, and that’s a good thing.	Paykunaqa sinchi kanku, chayqa allinmi.

He had to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.

But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
This is obviously wrong.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.
I know it is true.	Yachanim chiqap kasqanmanta.
But what is good.	Ichaqa imataq allin.
But it certainly looks like it.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chayman rikch’akun.
He always wants her with him.	Payqa sapa kutim munan paywan.
He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.

He’s that good.	Payqa chayna allinmi.
I wish you wouldn't.	Munaymanmi mana chayta ruwanaykita.

It's there all day.	Tukuy punchawmi chaypi kachkan.
He didn’t mean it.	Payqa manan chayta niyta munarqanchu.
Everything was wonderful.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi karqa.
But it isn’t.	Ichaqa manan.
I have my doubts here.	Kaypiqa iskayrayani.
No, he’s never alone.	Manan, manan hayk’aqpas sapallanchu.
That didn't seem right.	Chayqa manam allinchu rikchakurqa.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.
A lot of bad things.	Achka mana allin.
No, they certainly are.	Manan, cheqaqtapunin kanku.
It’s actually worse than that.	Chiqaptaqa chaymantaqa aswan mana allinmi.
He is very tired.	Payqa sinchitan sayk’usqa kashan.
He is a human being.	Payqa runam.
He’s been there a long time.	Payqa unayñan chaypi kashan.
I had to do it now.	Kunanmi ruwanay karqa.
I will be for sure!.	¡Cheqaqtapunin kasaq!.
It was very hard you know.	Ancha sasa karqan yachanki.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqan.
A lot of pipes, actually.	Achka pipas, chiqaptaqa.
He was alone, as always.	Payqa sapallanmi karqan, sapa kuti hina.
He was alone at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa sapallanmi kasqa.
It can still be.	Hinallam kanman.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
That’s fine with me.	Chayqa allinmi ñuqawanqa.
Not to anyone.	Mana pimanpas.
That’s what you think.	Chaytan yuyaykunki.
Someone to do that.	Pipas chayta ruwananpaq.
It was a quick one.	Chayqa usqhayllan karqan.
I want to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayta munani.
He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam karqa.
But he was alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi karqan.
It was actually fine.	Chiqaptaqa allintam karqa.
No one could help him.	Manan pipas yanapayta atirqanchu.
He was barely human.	Payqa yaqapaschá runa hina kasqa.
He wanted to do everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam ruwayta munarqa.
He didn’t say much.	Payqa manan anchatachu nisqa.
Two years, maybe three.	Iskay wata, ichapas kimsa.
One, then two, then three.	Huk, chaymanta iskay, chaymanta kimsa.
What is the right thing to do? 	¿Imatan ruwanan?
He agreed to do so.	Chayta ruwananpaqmi arí nisqa.
Of course, not everything is good.	Arí, manam tukuy imapas allinchu.
It really is that quick.	Chiqaptam chayna utqaylla.
He had to do something.	Imapas ruwanan karqa.
There was one this morning.	Kunan paqarin huk karqan.
You can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
That’s a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi.
He refused to believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta munarqanchu.
I’ll do the talking.	Rimayta ruwasaq.
So much goodness.	Chayna achka allin kay.
I don't know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
But it won’t be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanqa.
They are like that.	Paykunaqa hinam kanku.
But, of course, everything went wrong.	Ichaqa, sut’inmi, tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqan.
You mean yes to it.	Arí niyta munanki.
It’s not good, it’s not bad.	Mana allinchu, mana mana allinchu.
But this would be a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi kanman.
A very good one, at least for now.	Huk ancha allin kaq, kunankamapas.
He really wants to do things right.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin munan imatapas allinta ruwayta.
I mean the immediate game.	Chaylla pukllayta niyta munani.
It’s not always the case.	Manam sapa kutichu.
That was probably the case.	Chayqa yaqapaschá karqan.
To be safe.	Seguro kananpaq.
It went well, alright.	Allintam rirqa, allinmi.
. . . .	.
The first step is to do it.	Ñawpaq kaq ruway.
Not yet .	Manaraq .
I’m not good again.	Hukmanta mana allinchu kani.
This happened every single day, always.	Kayqa sapa sapa punchawmi karqa, sapa kutim.
What will happen will happen.	Imataq kanqa kanqa.
He’s not a good guy.	Payqa manam allinchu.
He did everything right.	Payqa tukuy imatam allinta ruwarqa.
He realized he was hurt.	Payqa repararqanmi k’irisqa kashasqanmanta.
I am now a married man.	Kunanqa casarasqa runam kani.
Something will be fine.	Imapas allinmi kanqa.
He knew where he was.	Payqa yacharqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta.
You are a good person.	Qamqa allin runam kanki.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
Be good to him.	Paywan allin kay.
Otherwise it was a really, really nice day.	Mana chayqa chiqap, chiqap sumaq punchawmi karqa.
I didn’t know what.	Manam yacharqanichu imata.
Everything in it.	Tukuy ima chaypi kaq.
That wouldn’t make things worse.	Chayqa manan imatapas aswan mana allintachu ruwanman.
I don’t want that to happen.	Manam munanichu chayna kananta.
You, you don't	Qamqa, manam .
Something was wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu karqa.
That’s a good thing now.	Chayqa kunanqa allinmi.
Sure enough, one day he told me to do something.	Seguro, huk punchawmi niwarqa imatapas ruwanaypaq.
Never not what the future holds.	Mana hayk’aqpas mana imachus hamuq tiempo kanqa chayta.
This would be a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu kanman.
I'll be fine.	Allinmi kasaq.
I really want that to happen.	Chiqaptam munani chayna kananta.
It’s not a good thing.	Manan allinchu.
That’s not easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
Maybe next year.	Ichapas hamuq wata.
I didn’t mean that.	Manam chayta niyta munarqanichu.
But that was a long time ago.	Ichaqa chayqa unayñan karqan.
You knew this.	Kaytaqa yacharqanki.
Not happy with it.	Mana kusisqachu.
Things may not be right.	Manapaschá imapas allinchu kanman.
. . . .	.
Things are as usual here.	Kaypiqa imapas sapa kuti hinam kachkan.
He said that it was.	Payqa nirqam chayna kasqanmanta.
I’ve done that.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani.
But of course this is not the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kayqa mana chay hinachu.
You can't do it.	Atiwaqchu.
I know there is nothing there.	Yachanim chaypi mana imapas kasqanmanta.
Something is wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
However, he is right.	Ichaqa, allintam nin.
Yes, it’s a good one.	Arí, allinmi.
He seemed to fit the bill.	Payqa chayman hinam rikchakurqa.
He’s planning to do it now.	Kunan ruwayta yuyaykushan.
It’s not like that.	Manan chay hinachu.
That’s what it’s going to be.	Chayqa kanqa.
I know everything about it.	Tukuy imatam yachani.
It was never bad.	Manam haykapipas mana allinchu karqa.
He looked nervous.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
You’re a great guy.	Hatun runam kanki.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqa.
I wonder how that happened.	Tapukuni imaynataq chay pasasqanmanta.
I had never seen that before.	Chaytaqa manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
I wonder what that is.	Tapukuni imataq chay kasqanmanta.
Sure it is now.	Seguro kunanmi kachkan.
But doing so well is not easy.	Ichaqa chayta allinta ruwayqa manan facilchu.
Not good, but effective.	Mana allinchu, ichaqa allin ruwaq.
He was lonely and almost depressed.	Payqa sapallanmi kasharqan, yaqapaschá llakisqa kasharqan.
I thought that would be great.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman nispaymi piensarqani.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
I’m not here anymore.	Manañam kaypichu kachkani.
They are really very good.	Chiqaptam ancha allin kanku.
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
It’s going to be pretty good.	Allin allinmi kanqa.
There really is no time.	Chiqaptaqa manam tiempo kanchu.
Now something is wrong.	Kunanqa imapas mana allinmi.
He does everything right.	Tukuy imatapas allintam ruwan.
Sure would do well.	Seguro allinta ruwanman.
To be happy.	Kusisqa kananpaq.
That’s right there.	Chayqa chaypi allinmi.
But it’s not yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi.
But he had to do something right.	Ichaqa allintan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
It’s going to be good.	Allinmi kanqa.
That you’re not alone.	Mana sapallayki kasqaykita.
I didn’t know what to do about it.	Manam yacharqanichu chaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
It should be a good one.	Allinmi kanan.
That means something is wrong.	Chayqa niyta munan imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
But it may not be the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá chay hinachu kanman.
Do it quickly.	Utqaylla ruway.
That’s obviously not the case here.	Chayqa sut’inmi kaypi mana chay hinachu.
The process did not go well.	Chay ruwayqa manam allintachu rirqa.
I don’t know what to say about this.	Manam yachanichu kaymanta ima niyta.
You wouldn’t want that.	Manam munawaqchu chaytaqa.
Never saw him before this afternoon.	Mana hayk’aqpas kunan tarde ñawpaqtaqa rikurqanichu.
I know how hard it is here.	Yachanim kaypi imayna sasa kasqanmanta.
He knew he didn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
But it went well.	Ichaqa allintam rirqa.
But that’s what he meant.	Ichaqa chaytan niyta munarqan.
He wants to tell you something.	Imatapas willayta munan.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
Not yet.	Mana manaraq.
You are, sometimes.	Qamqa kanki, wakin kuti.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
Indeed, it was.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
That wasn’t the worst part.	Chayqa manan aswan mana allinchu karqan.
I’ve never seen it before.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
Be the first!.	¡Ñawpaq kaq kay!.
That was probably the best thing ever.	Chayqa yaqapaschá aswan allin karqan.
I'm not sure anymore either.	Ñuqapas manañam segurochu kani.
But I can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atiymanchu.
I’d love to be there with you.	Chaypi qanwan kuska kayta anchata munani.
What’s strong.	Imataq sinchi.
You want it like you do now.	Kunan hinam munanki.
He doesn’t know how to do it.	Payqa manan yachanchu imayna ruwananta.
Bad, bad, bad.	Mana allin, mana allin, mana allin.
He seems happy.	Payqa kusisqa hinam kachkan.
You know, like before.	Yachanki, ñawpaq hina.
All right, all right, all right.	Allinmi, allinmi, allinmi.
He was happy here.	Payqa kaypi kusisqa kasharqan.
But maybe he will.	Ichaqa ichapas chayta ruwanqa.
He could have done it very hard.	Payqa ancha sinchitan ruwayta atinman karqan.
Here it is for you always.	Kaypi kachkan qampaq sapa kuti.
But of course that wasn’t the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu karqan.
But really, no.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin, manan.
They’re obviously tired.	Sut’inmi sayk’usqa kasqankuta.
I want to do it tonight.	Kunan tuta ruwayta munani.
If you have to do this, you will.	Kayta ruwanayki tiyan chayqa, ruwanki.
He pretends to be sad.	Llakisqa hinam ruwan.
Man, they’re beautiful.	Runa, sumaqmi kanku.
Do it quickly.	Utqaylla ruway.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
He is still not happy.	Payqa kunankamapas manam kusisqachu kachkan.
I could hardly say anything.	Manapaschá imatapas niyta atirqanichu.
Maybe he never could.	Ichapas mana haykapipas atinmanchu karqa.
I don't like this.	Kayqa manam gustawanchu.
What is the right thing to do? 	¿Imatan ruwanan?
He used to do that.	Payqa chaytan ruwaq.
Maybe it’s more accurate.	Ichapas aswan chiqap kanman.
She could tell he was unhappy.	Payqa repararqanmi mana kusisqa kashasqanmanta.
It can be all day long.	Tukuy punchawmi kanman.
He wasn't sure he could do that.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan chayta ruway atisqanmanta.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I was early as usual.	Sapa kuti hinam temprano karqani.
I couldn’t speak.	Manam rimayta atirqanichu.
Now, it better be quick.	Kunanqa, aswan allinmi utqaylla.
It can be good, it can be bad.	Allinmi kanman, mana allinmi kanman.
He can’t do it.	Payqa manan ruwayta atinchu.
But he can’t tell you much about that one.	Ichaqa manan chay hukmanta anchata willayta atinchu.
I know you can do better.	Yachanim aswan allinta ruwayta atisqaykita.
You think you can do what you want.	Munasqaykita ruwayta atisqaykita yuyanki.
Alright.	Allinmi.
However, this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa, kayqa manam allinchu.
I can’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atiymanchu.
But it was always there.	Ichaqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
I wish it was all the time.	Munaymanmi tukuy tiempo kananta.
Now, here’s another thing.	Kunanqa, kaypi huk kaq.
I don’t know how to play this.	Kayta pukllayta mana yachanichu.
Three days after that.	Kimsa punchaw chaymanta.
Every day, in fact.	Sapa punchawmi, chiqaptaqa.
I know you are not happy.	Yachanim mana kusisqachu kasqaykita.
It’s all right.	Lliwmi.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
This doesn’t work well.	Kayqa mana allintachu ruwan.
I'm sure you're tired.	Seguro kani sayk'usqa kasqaykita.
Now of course, of course.	Kunanqa sut’inmi, sut’inmi.
One night maybe.	Huk tuta ichapas.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
He’s the one who does it.	Payqa chaytan ruwan.
You can no longer be sure what will happen.	Manañan seguro kayta atiwaqchu imachus pasananta.
Be the first to be.	Ñawpaq kaq kay.
It must be alone.	Sapallanmi kanan.
You are less than nothing.	Mana imamanta pisi kanki.
This process was successful.	Kay ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
It wasn’t easy.	Manam facilchu karqa.
I mean, anyone.	Niyta munani, pitapas.
Anything anything I don’t want anymore.	Imapas imatapas manañam munanichu.
She looked so nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
He was very angry with her.	Payqa llumpay phiñasqa kasqa paywan.
What is the probability? 	¿Imataq kanman?
This process is anything but quick.	Kay ruwayqa imapas ichaqa utqaylla.
Maybe this was the first time.	Ichapas kayqa ñawpaq kuti karqa.
It was actually nice.	Chiqaptaqa sumaqmi karqa.
. . . .	.
Everything looks great now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas ancha allinmi rikchakun.
Everything is good for you.	Tukuy imapas allinmi qampaq.
I can’t go to the gym.	Manam riyta atiymanchu.
Maybe it was the time.	Ichapas chay tiempo karqa.
He did much better.	Payqa aswan allintan ruwarqan.
However, it wasn’t.	Ichaqa, manan chay hinachu karqan.
It’s a new day.	Musuq punchawmi.
But it doesn’t matter now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa imananpaschu.
Maybe there was a bit of truth in that.	Ichapas chaypi huk chikan chiqap kaq karqa.
There is no time left now.	Kunanqa manañam tiempo kanchu.
This looks very interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
That was not an easy task.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu karqan.
I know he was happy.	Yachanim kusisqa kasqanmanta.
That would be wonderful.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi kanman.
But no no no.	Ichaqa manan manan mana.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
This was supposed to be a good day.	Kayqa allin punchawmi kanan karqa.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
Now, no one knows.	Kunanqa, manam pipas yachanchu.
Clearly it’s not.	Sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
He’s busy but he says yes.	Payqa ocupasqa kashan ichaqa arí nin.
I was very happy.	Llumpay kusisqam karqani.
Something was wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu karqa.
He probably doesn’t.	Payqa manapaschá.
He is a human being.	Payqa runam.
But, please .	Ichaqa, ama hina kaspa .
It was probably a very difficult one.	Yaqapaschá sinchi sasa kaq.
Clearly it was.	Sut’inmi chay hina karqan.
I am so glad that it did.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chayna kasqanmanta.
Better not.	Aswan allinmi mana.
Maybe he will, someday.	Ichapas ruwanman, huk punchaw.
I want it to be here.	Kaypi kananta munani.
That wasn’t quite the case.	Chayqa manan allintachu karqan.
Everything remains the same.	Tukuy imapas hinallam kachkan.
She had never been this happy.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas kay hina kusisqachu karqan.
How did I figure out how to do this.	Imaynatataq kayta ruwanaypaq yuyaykurqani.
Not sure about this.	Mana segurochu kaymanta.
It was early afternoon.	Chayqa karqa tarde temprano.
I can't be here all day.	Manam tukuy punchaw kaypi kayta atiymanchu.
Now to do this.	Kunanqa kayta ruwananpaq.
He is doing very well.	Ancha allintam ruwachkan.
But of course he was there.	Ichaqa sut’inmi payqa chaypi kasharqan.
That worked out fine.	Chayqa allintam ruwarqa.
It looks like they might be.	Paykunaqa kanman hinam rikchakun.
Every day was so fresh.	Sapa punchawmi ancha musuq karqa.
It was a difficult day.	Sasa punchawmi karqa.
It’s better for you.	Aswan allinmi qampaq.
I think it is wrong.	Mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
You never really know.	Qamqa manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa yachankichu.
That’s what he could have been.	Chaytan payqa kanman karqan.
I’ll make you some coffee.	Kukata ruwasaq.
He really didn’t know.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana yacharqanchu.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kayqa.
That was really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi karqa.
He seemed very busy.	Payqa ancha ocupasqa hinam karqa.
I think it’s up to me.	Yuyaykuni ñuqamanta kasqanmanta.
He had a lot of it.	Payqa achkatam karqa.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
There is no one.	Manam pipas kanchu.
It looks very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
This is not good for anything.	Kayqa mana imamantapas allinchu.
I think that’s interesting.	Chayqa sumaqmi nispaymi yuyaykuni.
It went well enough.	Allintam rirqa.
I think it is a bad thing to do.	Mana allin ruway kasqanmantam piensani.
All this is good.	Tukuy kayqa allinmi.
I can’t do anything about that.	Chaytaqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
I’m sure he didn’t.	Seguro kani mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I hope to do this better next year then.	Suyachkani aswan allinta ruwayta kayta hamuq wata chaymanta.
It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
He said I didn't, but maybe.	Payqa nirqam mana ruwasqayta, ichaqa ichapas.
I can’t do this.	Manam kayta ruwaymanchu.
He couldn't say no.	Payqa manan mana niyta atinmanchu karqan.

But something had to happen.	Ichaqa imapas kanan karqan.
Do what you want! 	¡Munasqaykita ruway!
They’re injured.	Paykunaqa k’irisqa kanku.
But of course that wasn’t the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu karqan.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
Happy, happy doing.	Kusisqa, kusisqa ruway.
I’m sure he’s a tough guy.	Seguro kani sinchi runa kasqanmanta.
I’m a human being too.	Ñuqapas runam kani.

Nothing went right.	Manam imapas allintachu rirqa.

I couldn’t do it.	Manam atirqanichu.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I don’t like anyone anymore.	Manañam pitapas gustanchu.
But this would not be the case.	Ichaqa kayqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
He wasn’t good enough.	Payqa manan allinchu karqan.
But he didn’t do much.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu ruwarqan.
He was happy the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon kusisqa kasharqan.

He didn't know what to do.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.
He was worried that something might go wrong.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan imapas mana allinchu kanman chaymanta.
But you can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atiwaqchu.
Otherwise it means nothing.	Mana chayqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu.

He said he was fine.	Payqa allinmi kashasqanmanta nisqa.
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.

This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
No one really knows what happened.	Manan pipas cheqaqtachu yachan imachus pasasqanmanta.

There is no time.	Manam tiempo kanchu.
All very good.	Tukuy ancha allin.
The future was very uncertain.	Hamuq tiempopiqa ancha mana segurochu karqan.
But then, maybe not.	Ichaqa chaymanta, ichapas mana.
It makes the game better.	Chayqa pukllayta aswan allinta ruwan.
He was angry and scared.	Payqa phiñasqa mancharisqa ima kasqa.
He wasn’t like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu kasharqan.
Alright.	Allinmi.
Now he has to do things right.	Kunanmi imapas allinta ruwanan.

It wasn’t very good.	Manam ancha allinchu karqa.
But, you know.	Ichaqa, yachanki.
This was obviously wrong.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu karqan.
Do whatever you want with me.	Ñoqawan ima munasqaykita ruway.
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Here’s a little bit about me.	Kaypi huk chikan ñuqamanta kachkan.
That’s it, it’s not.	Chayqa, manañam.
It was as it should be.	Chayqa imayna kanan hinam karqa.

Okay, he was human.	Allinmi, payqa runam karqa.
It doesn’t matter if you do this.	Kayta ruwayqa manam imananpaschu.
Now it seems very real that something is wrong.	Kunanqa ancha chiqap hinam imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
They are beautiful though.	Paykunaqa sumaqmi ichaqa.
Insurance is important.	Seguro nisqa ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
Now he knows better.	Kunanqa aswan allintam yachan.
Tom was excellent.	Tomqa ancha allinmi karqa.
How did he say that.	Imaynataq chayta nisqa.
Obviously, both would be wrong.	Sut’inmi, iskayninku mana allinchu kanman.
I didn’t know it.	Manam yacharqanichu.
He was very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa kasqa.
He wasn't supposed to be here.	Payqa manan kaypichu kanan karqan.

Tell me something.	Imatapas willay.

In fact, it’s.	Chiqaptaqa.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.

No one is alone.	Manan pipas sapallanchu.
I've always been like that.	Sapa kutim chayna karqani.

I didn’t know about this.	Manam kaymanta yacharqanichu.
I almost certainly did.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqani.
I would be very sad to be	Sinchi llakisqa kayman kay .
But it looked good.	Ichaqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
That’s the kind of thing.	Chayna kaq.
But that was not the case here.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan kaypiqa.
I knew why.	Yacharqanim imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He didn’t want to do anything.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta munarqanchu.
Do something tomorrow.	Paqarin imatapas ruway.
I’ll be fine though.	Allinmi kasaq ichaqa.
I mean, this morning.	Niyta munani, kunan paqarin.
I can’t believe that.	Chaytaqa manan creeyta atiymanchu.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
But the process was not so easy.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu karqan chay ruwayqa.
I thought that would be it.	Chayna kanman nispaymi piensarqani.

You be there, now.	Qamqa chaypi kay, kunanqa.
It looked bad, alright .	Mana allinmi rikchakurqa, allinmi .
Nothing about being tough.	Mana imapas sinchi kaymanta.
You can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I never thought much about it.	Manam haykapipas anchatachu chaymantaqa piensarqani.
I never want to be like that.	Manam haykapipas chayna kaytaqa munanichu.
I had to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanay karqa.
It wasn’t the first time.	Manam ñawpaq kutichu karqa.

Now he was terrified.	Kunanqa mancharisqa kasqa.

Maybe it would be good.	Ichapas allin kanman.
You know what I mean? 	Yachankichu imata niyta munani?
No one is like that.	Manan pipas chay hinachu.
That’s almost .	Chayqa yaqa .

I’m not sure what year it was.	Manam allintachu yachani ima wata kasqanmanta.
It had been a very long time.	Ancha unayñan kasqa.
After all, it’s.	Tukuy imamanta.
Maybe he’s the one.	Ichapas payqa.
You have to do this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwanayki.
He can’t let that happen.	Mana chay pasananta atinchu.
Now he said it all the time.	Kunanqa tukuy tiempon chayta nisqa.
I don't really like this.	Kayqa manam anchatachu gustan.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
He doesn’t want to.	Payqa manam munanchu.
What’s the answer to that? 	¿Imataq chaymanta?
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I may not be happy about it.	Manapaschá chaymantaqa kusisqachu kasaq.
First, he’s right.	Ñawpaqtaqa, payqa allintam nin.
I'm sure it is.	Seguro kani chayna kasqanmanta.
It wasn’t the best.	Manam aswan allinchu karqa.
Anything less than that.	Imapas aswan pisi kaq.
But then, he was there.	Ichaqa chaymanta, payqa chaypi kasqa.
It’s not the worst.	Aswan mana allinchu.
What wasn’t right.	Imataq mana allinchu karqa.
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.

He’s good at it.	Payqa allinmi chaypi.
But you can’t be human now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa runa kayta atiwaqchu.
Maybe it’s not easy.	Ichapas mana facilchu kanman.
He was always alone.	Payqa sapa kutim sapallan karqa.
Maybe it should be.	Ichapas chayna kanan.
Everything is fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
Now I am not so sure.	Kunanqa manam chayna segurochu kani.
Almost everything that could go wrong, went wrong.	Yaqa tukuy imapas mana allintachu rinanpaq, mana allintachu rirqa.
It has always been so.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chhayna karqan.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
Do it a lot.	Anchata ruway.
I think you should.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwanaykipaq.
But I’ll probably go.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá risaq.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.

Now you want to talk.	Kunanqa rimayta munanki.
You can’t do this.	Kaytaqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
Being a human being.	Huk runa kay.
This would not be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman.
I can’t get over that.	Chaytaqa manam atipayta atiymanchu.

That’s what I had to do.	Chaytan ruwanay karqan.
He was a very lonely man.	Payqa ancha sapallan runam karqa.
She said, what do you want.	Payqa nisqa, imatataq munanki.
No, it’s never been.	Manan, manan hayk’aqpas.

He was in a deep state of distress.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
What should he do now.	Imatataq kunan ruwanan.
But nothing is ever that simple.	Ichaqa manan imapas hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu.
It’s like anything else.	Imapas hinam.
But now you know better.	Ichaqa kunanmi aswan allinta yachanki.
No one wants to go first.	Manan pipas ñawpaqtaqa riyta munanchu.
A really great guy.	Chiqap hatun runa.
That looked really interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
But don’t learn to do that.	Ichaqa ama chayta ruwayta yachankichu.
No one thought anyone would ever come here.	Manan pipas yuyaykurqanchu kayman hayk’aqllapas pipas hamunanta.
Perhaps, he is gone now.	Ichapas, kunanqa manaña kanchu.
But he is not happy.	Ichaqa manan kusisqachu kashan.
He already knows what’s going on.	Ñam yachan imapas kasqanmanta.
I am very sorry now.	Kunanqa anchatam llakikuni.
Please what can go wrong.	Ama hina kaspa imataq mana allin kanman.
But no one knew.	Ichaqa manan pipas yacharqanchu.
I mean swimming in it.	Chaypi nadayta niyta munani.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
It’s not exactly that.	Manam allintachu chayna.
It wasn’t very good.	Mana ancha allinchu karqan.
The day went badly.	Chay punchawqa mana allintam rirqa.
However, this may not always be the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
I have always wanted to do something.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi imatapas ruwayta munarqani.
It was still not good enough.	Hinallam mana allinchu karqa.
He realized it was night.	Payqa repararqanmi tuta kasqanmanta.
There is no one.	Manam pipas kanchu.
Yes, it is very beautiful.	Arí, ancha sumaqmi.
He knows exactly what he is going to do.	Allintam yachan ima ruwananta.

He was not alone in this.	Payqa manam sapallanchu kaypi karqa.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
That meant tonight.	Chayqa kunan tuta niyta munarqa.
Perhaps they are.	Ichapas chayna kanku.
It’s not good yet, but it’s better.	Manaraqmi allinchu, ichaqa aswan allinmi.
Maybe this is a big deal.	Ichapas kayqa hatun imapas kanman.
He knew nothing about it.	Payqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqanchu.
If you don’t know what it is, you should.	Mana yachankichu ima kasqanmanta chayqa, chaytan ruwanayki.
She refused to talk to him.	Payqa manan munarqanchu paywan rimayta.
That is certainly difficult.	Cheqaqtapunin chayqa sasa.
He’s always, always good.	Payqa sapa kuti, sapa kuti allin.
Who wants to do that?.	¿Pitaq chayta ruwayta munan?.
He was such a man.	Payqa chayna runam karqa.
He didn’t want another win.	Payqa manan huk atipayta munarqanchu.

He knows there is no one here.	Payqa yachanmi kaypi mana pipas kasqanmanta.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
You’ve always been there.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqanki.
He is a very lonely man.	Payqa ancha sapallan runam.
What’s wrong with me? 	¿Imataq ñuqawan kachkan?
But that would be better.	Ichaqa chayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
Something didn't seem right.	Imapas mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
I’m just not very good at it.	Chaylla mana ancha allinchu kani chaypi.
I did everything alone.	Sapallanmi tukuy imatapas ruwarqani.

I can’t really tell you.	Manam chiqaptaqa willayta atiymanchu.
And he said yes.	Hinan payqa arí nisqa.
But that was a long time ago.	Ichaqa unayñan chayqa karqan.
That, it seems, is yes.	Chayqa, arí hinam.
It’s not easy.	Manan facilchu.
You're right.	Qamqa chiqaptam.

Tell them all about it.	Tukuy chayta willay.
That was me, too.	Chayqa ñuqapas karqani.
It didn’t seem right.	Manam allinchu rikchakurqa.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu.
I’ll do the talking.	Rimayta ruwasaq.
He did the right thing.	Payqa allintan ruwarqan.
This stuff is great.	Kay imapas ancha allinmi.
I am very, very happy.	Ñuqaqa ancha, ancha kusisqam kachkani.
No, no, not really.	Manan, manan, cheqaqtachu.
But that was .	Ichaqa chayqa karqan .
But it seemed to be the case.	Ichaqa chayna kanan hinam karqa.
He was furious with her, after all.	Payqa sinchitan phiñasqa paywan, tukuy imamanta.
Then you will have to do better.	Chaymantaqa astawan allinta ruwanayki kanqa.
Very, very lonely.	Ancha, ancha sapallan.
Actually, that’s a good thing.	Chiqaptaqa, chayqa allinmi.
That’s what you need to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki.
He will be something more, something beyond that.	Payqa kanqa imapas aswan, imapas chaymanta aswan.
That's almost likely.	Chayqa yaqapaschá yaqapaschá kanman.
It’s not always good.	Manam sapa kutichu allin.
Not to anyone.	Mana pimanpas.
Take a swim.	Huk nadayta ruway.
But it wasn’t like it used to be.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu karqan.
This is all good stuff.	Kay tukuy imapas allinmi.
It says a lot.	Achkatam nin.

That would be better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
He couldn’t be more upset.	Payqa manan aswan llakisqa kayta atirqanchu.
He didn’t do it right.	Manam allintachu ruwarqa.
However, they are not.	Ichaqa, manan chay hinachu kanku.
Maybe more than one.	Ichapas hukmanta aswan achka kanman.
But it will take some time.	Ichaqa huk tiempon kanqa.
Then he has to be alone.	Chaymantaqa sapallan kanan tiyan.
It was like a married couple.	Chayqa karqa casarasqa hinam.
You want something more.	Astawan imatapas munanki.
All right, great.	Allinmi, hatun.
He seemed fine.	Payqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
This is a great guy.	Kayqa hatun runam.
He couldn’t have done that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
Maybe he was alone here.	Ichapas kaypi sapallan karqa.
But you’re fine.	Ichaqa allinmi kanki.
He was very angry.	Payqa sinchi phiñasqa kasharqan.
He was terrified.	Payqa mancharisqa kasqa.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
Yes, he said.	Arí nispa.
She was beautiful, for sure.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa, seguro.
But it almost never worked out.	Ichaqa yaqa mana hayk’aqpas allinchu karqan.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
You want to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwayta munanki.
But it would be very useful.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi kanman.
You’re alone in yourself.	Sapallanmi kanki.
He says it’s great.	Payqa ancha allinmi nin.
That’s the only thing.	Chayqa chaylla.
There was nothing wrong with it.	Manam imapas mana allinchu karqa.

Okay, maybe .	Allinmi, ichapas .

You wouldn’t want that, would you?.	Manam chaytaqa munawaqchu, ¿aw?.
I didn’t know how long it would take.	Manam yacharqanichu hayka tiempo pasananta.

It wasn’t supposed to be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan karqan.
No one knows what it is.	Manan pipas yachanchu.
I’m not very good at it.	Manam ancha allinchu kani.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.
Probably not so much.	Yaqapaschá mana anchatachu.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Nothing, really.	Mana imapas, chiqaptaqa.
No, he was angry.	Manan, payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.

You are so unhappy.	Chayna mana kusisqam kanki.
I'm pretty sure he did.	Yaqa segurom kani chayta ruwasqanmanta.

This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
But not everything went well.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imapas allinchu karqan.
He is doing a good job.	Payqa allintam ruwachkan.
He can do it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwanman.
I thought nothing of it.	Chaytaqa manam imatapas piensarqanichu.
Yes, it’s a bad thing.	Arí, mana allinmi.
This makes the process more interesting.	Kayqa aswan sumaq ruwayta ruwan.

Nothing is certain.	Manam imapas segurochu kachkan.

You know something.	Imatapas yachanki.

Today, he cannot make good on his failure.	Kunan tiempopiqa manan allintachu ruwayta atinman mana allin ruwasqanmanta.

He’s bad for you.	Payqa mana allinmi qampaq.

This is not the best way.	Kayqa manam aswan allinchu.
She was certainly enjoying herself.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa kusisqa kasharqan.
It’s always there.	Sapa kutim chaypi kachkan.

This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.

He doesn’t want to come.	Mana hamuyta munanchu.
But this seemed fine.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
Yes, he was alone.	Arí, payqa sapallanmi karqa.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
Okay, it looks good.	Allinmi, allinmi rikchakun.
It was his real name.	Chiqap sutinmi karqa.
He is doing very well on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi ancha allinta ruwachkan.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
But it wasn't too bad yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi llumpay mana allinchu karqa.
I thought that was really interesting.	Chaytaqa ancha sumaqmi nispaymi piensarqani.
He did something about it.	Payqa imatapas ruwarqa.
Do the right thing.	Chayta ruway.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
You were never going to succeed.	Manam haykapipas allintachu ruwanayki karqa.
It was more interesting.	Aswan sumaqmi karqa.
You really can’t tell.	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atiwaqchu.

I never really knew.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa yacharqanichu.

It wouldn’t be too good not to do it.	Mana ancha allinchu kanman mana ruwanaykipaqqa.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
That was obviously wrong.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu karqan.

He wasn't sure what to make of it.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan chaymanta ima ruwananta.

Of course, things could be worse.	Arí, imapas aswan mana allinmi kanman.

Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
It just didn't seem right.	Chaylla mana allintachu rikchakurqa.

Now that doesn’t matter.	Kunanqa manan chayqa imananpaschu.
It just wasn’t good enough.	Chaylla mana allinchu karqa.
He wasn’t happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu karqan.
No one ever wanted that.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas chaytaqa munarqanchu.
But he may not be able to.	Ichaqa manapaschá atinmanchu.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
I’m sorry it wasn’t right.	Pampachaykuway mana allinchu kasqanmanta.

That seems really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi rikchakun.
No one wants to be here.	Manam pipas kaypi kayta munanchu.
Now, whether I can do it, I’m not sure.	Kunanqa, ruwayta atiymanchu icha manachu, mana segurochu kani.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
This whole thing is very interesting.	Kay tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi.

He knows you can.	Payqa yachanmi atisqaykita.
They are not sure.	Paykunaqa manan segurochu kanku.
He always refused.	Payqa sapa kutim mana munarqanchu.
This one was the best.	Kayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
I thought about it almost every day.	Yaqa sapa punchawmi chaypi piensarqani.
He knows how to play.	Payqa pukllayta yachan.
He said he wasn’t sure.	Payqa manan segurochu kashasqanmanta nirqan.
Why would anyone do that?.	¿Imanasqataq pipas chayta ruwanman?.
That’s probably going to happen.	Chayqa yaqapaschá kanqa.

He seems to be angry.	Payqa phiñasqa hinam kachkan.
I’m not sure yet.	Manaraqmi segurochu kani.
But everything went wrong.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
You don’t really know that.	Chaytaqa manan allintachu yachanki.
He had no idea why he was here.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imarayku kaypi kasqanmanta.
He would certainly be good.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin allin kanman.

That has always been the case.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
I wasn’t good enough.	Manam allinchu karqani.
He’s obviously tired.	Payqa sut’inmi sayk’usqa kashan.
I don’t want to do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta munanichu.
Above all, you have to act accordingly.	Tukuy imamantapas chayman hinam ruwanayki.
You have to do this.	Kayta ruwanayki tiyan.
He does things right.	Payqa allintam imatapas ruwan.
It was like this.	Kay hinam karqa.
Okay, more than a little.	Allinmi, aswan huk chikan.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
I can't do it today.	Kunan punchawqa manam atiymanchu.
It’s been bad for a very long time.	Ancha unayñan mana allinchu.
I doubt he was alone.	Iskayrayani sapallan kasqanmanta.
It’s a name.	Sutinmi.
After all, it seems.	Tukuy imamanta, rikchakun.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Nothing else about it.	Mana imapas chaymantaqa.
I'm happy with how it turned out.	Kusisqam kachkani imayna kasqanmanta.

That’s not the worst part.	Chayqa manan aswan mana allinchu.

I don’t want to play this game.	Kay pukllayta mana pukllayta munanichu.
Something is seriously wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas sinchi hatun mana allinmi kachkan.

But it was beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi karqa.
The task will not be easy, however.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu kanqa ichaqa.

This was not always the case.	Kayqa manam sapa kuti hinachu karqa.
I know it's a good thing.	Allintam yachani.
But nobody likes it.	Ichaqa manan pipas gustanchu.
I’m not happy about it.	Manam chaymantaqa kusisqachu kani.
Maybe he could have done better.	Ichapas aswan allinta ruwanman karqa.
I thought it was really good.	Chiqap allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He knows something.	Payqa imatapas yachanmi.
I don’t know how it is.	Manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmanta.

But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.

And he was angry.	Hinan payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chay hina karqan.
Man is very happy.	Runa ancha kusisqa.

It may not be a good idea.	Manapaschá allinchu kanman.
That is what he had to do.	Chaytan payqa ruwanan karqan.
He’s not a good guy.	Payqa manan allinchu.
All right, we’re all right.	Allinmi, allinmi kayku.
He wants to know everything.	Tukuy imata yachayta munan.

Yes, that’s a bad thing.	Arí, chayqa mana allinmi.

It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
I would never, ever, do that.	Manam haykapipas, haykapipas, chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
There is a third person.	Kimsa kaq runam kachkan.
That doesn’t mean they’re bad.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana allinchu kasqankuta.
He didn't want her to do that.	Payqa manan munarqanchu chayta ruwananta.
A couple of days.	Huk iskay punchaw.
Maybe someone else.	Ichapas huk runa.
Always more and more unrealistic.	Sapa kuti aswan aswan mana chiqap kaq.

But this is now.	Ichaqa kunanmi kayqa.

I don’t know that.	Manam chaytaqa yachanichu.
You were alone.	Sapallanmi karqanki.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
But that’s what he wanted.	Ichaqa chaytan payqa munarqan.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I know what it’s like.	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta.
No one can do this.	Manan pipas kaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
I would have never done that either.	Ñuqapas manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa.
Not quite yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu.
I can't believe that.	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atiymanchu.
This is a new character.	Kayqa musuq runam.

You absolutely have to.	Qamqa chiqaptam ruwanayki.
I'm sorry.	Llakikuni.
I’m a pretty tough guy.	Ñuqaqa allin sinchi runam kani.
They are really good.	Chiqaptam allin kanku.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.
All good there.	Tukuy allin chaypi.
That was probably the case.	Chayqa yaqapaschá karqan.
He was in a state of distress.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan.
You don’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachankichu.
Like a human being.	Runa hina.
Great day.	Hatun punchaw.
I'm afraid.	Manchakuni.
But he couldn’t do this alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallan kayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
That wasn’t quite the case.	Chayqa manan allintachu karqan.
If that were the case.	Sichus chayna kanman karqa.
What a beautiful man.	Ima sumaq runa.
I really didn't see it coming.	Chiqaptaqa manam hamunanta rikurqanichu.
But then something.	Ichaqa chaymanta imapas.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I'll do it right.	Allintam ruwasaq.
I’m not there anymore.	Manañam ñuqaqa kanchu.

But it could have been worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan.
Something was really wrong.	Imapas chiqaptam mana allinchu karqa.
He is not alone.	Sapallanmi mana kanchu.
Perhaps that is not a good thing.	Yaqapaschá chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
Here's one.	Kaypi huk.
Maybe it doesn’t exist.	Ichapas mana kanchu.
It will take a while.	Huk tiempon kanqa.
I suspect it is not.	Sospechani mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He should be happy, but he’s not.	Payqa kusisqa kanan, ichaqa manan.
You can’t go from there.	Manam chaymantaqa riyta atiwaqchu.

Everything is very interesting.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi.

He seemed happy.	Payqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
He was originally a .	Payqa ñawpaqtaqa huk .
I know what he can do.	Yachanim ima ruway atisqanmanta.
There was someone every day.	Sapa punchawmi pipas karqa.
But that’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu chayqa.
This isn’t the case.	Manam kayqa kanchu.
Second, the objects.	Iskay kaq, imakuna.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
I’m not sure what happens next.	Manam segurochu kani imakuna chaymanta pasananta.
Which is the first one.	Imataq ñawpaq kaq.
He wants to win here.	Payqa kaypi atipayta munan.
But this was not alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu kayqa karqan.
He didn’t want to do this.	Payqa manan kayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
He acted quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwarqan.
It had to be strong.	Sinchi kanan karqan.
Here he was not sure.	Kaypiqa manam segurochu karqa.
It’s like this.	Kay hinam.
She’s beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi.
What happened to him.	Paywan ima pasasqanmanta.
I would be very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kayman.
But he had to do it.	Ichaqa ruwanan karqan.
No one did it right.	Manam pipas allintachu ruwarqa.
Now they are now.	Kunanqa kunanmi kachkanku.
I'm sure it will all be up tomorrow.	Seguro kani paqarin tukuy imapas kanqa.
That’s the most interesting thing.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
Okay, how about this.	Allinmi, imaynataq kayqa.
That’s just the way it is.	Chayqa chay hinallam.
Here it is, right here.	Kaypi kachkan.
Something like that.	Imapas chayna kaq.
Now there is nothing.	Kunanqa manam imapas kanchu.
But things are not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu imapas.
It was a good year.	Allin wata kasqa.
I know that it is.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta.
Nothing ever could.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas atirqanchu.
You were very happy.	Ancha kusisqam karqanki.
If that wouldn’t work, it would.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman chayqa, allinmi kanman.
Nothing major though.	Mana imapas hatun ichaqa.
Obviously he is.	Sut’inmi payqa.
Of course, it wasn’t easy.	Arí, manan facilchu karqan.
Things weren’t always like that.	Manan sapa kutichu imapas chhayna karqan.
There is no one here.	Manam pipas kaypichu kachkan.
But not in solitude.	Ichaqa manan sapallan kaypichu.
It wouldn’t be a good thing.	Mana allinchu kanman.
We are together every day.	Sapa punchawmi kuska kayku.
This is bad, bad, bad.	Kayqa mana allin, mana allin, mana allin.
However, this may not always be the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
I didn’t want to know more.	Manam astawan yachayta munarqanichu.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
I know he can do it.	Yachanim chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
He is not alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu kashan.
But one day you will know.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi yachanki.
You are always late.	Sapa kutim tarde kanki.
I am a happy person.	Kusisqa runam kani.
I didn’t want him to be there.	Manam munarqanichu chaypi kananta.
I'll do it right.	Allintam ruwasaq.
But, why is it? 	Ichaqa, ¿imarayku?
Then, the third.	Chaymanta, kimsa kaq.
Yes, he will do it.	Arí, ruwanqa.
But it’s still there.	Ichaqa hinallam kachkan.
I’m not happy with it.	Manam kusisqachu kachkani.
I don’t know what’s going to happen now.	Manam yachanichu kunan imakuna pasananta.
He knew something was wrong, very wrong.	Payqa yacharqanmi imapas mana allin kashasqanmanta, ancha mana allin kashasqanmanta.
It wasn’t like it is now.	Manam kunan hinachu karqa.
What's in it.	Imataq chaypi kachkan.
He wanted to tell her.	Willayta munarqa.
But what is it.	Ichaqa imataq.
I just don’t know how.	Chaylla mana yachanichu imaynatachus chayta.
This can actually be a bad thing.	Kayqa chiqaptaqa mana allinmi kanman.
Great for you!.	¡Hatun qampaq!.
But how can this be.	Ichaqa, ¿imaynataq kay kanman.
I still think about it a lot.	Kunankamapas anchatam chaypi piensani.
It looks like a	Rikchakun huk .
I thought that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
I don’t know what to say about that.	Manam yachanichu chaymanta ima niyta.
I really want to know.	Anchatan munani yachayta.
They're not bad, actually.	Paykunaqa manam mana allinchu kanku, chiqaptaqa.
I know something is wrong.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmantam yachani.
That’s what he did, after all.	Chaytan ruwarqan, tukuy imamanta.
Now is the time for that.	Kunanmi chayna tiempo.
I don’t know how to say it.	Manam yachanichu imayna niyta.
More worried than anything else.	Imamantapas aswan llakisqa.
He does it well.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwan.
You were very, very happy about it.	Ancha, ancha kusisqam karqanki chaymanta.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
Maybe something like that works for you.	Ichapas chayna imapas qampaq allin kanman.
He was a good, good man .	Payqa allin, allin runan karqan .
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But he doesn’t want to tell.	Ichaqa manan willayta munanchu.
He was, you know.	Payqa karqan, yachanki.
I wasn’t good at this.	Manam kaypi allintachu karqani.
He looked almost sad.	Yaqa llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
He had always been alone.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi sapallan karqa.
I can’t say what will happen.	Manam niyta atiymanchu imakuna pasananta.
He seemed nervous.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam karqa.
Otherwise, I don’t know what to do.	Mana chayqa, manan yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
This process is very important.	Kay ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
I really, really am.	Chiqaptam, chiqaptam kani.
He really was something.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin imapas karqan.
She looks very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
It could have been tomorrow.	Paqarin kanman karqan.
He didn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
You can’t be here.	Manam kaypi kayta atiwaqchu.
I couldn’t do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atirqanichu.

But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kayqa.
No one seemed sure.	Manam pipas seguro hinachu karqa.
Nothing is like that now.	Kunanqa manan imapas chay hinachu.
Yeah, sorry about that.	Arí, chaymanta pampachaykuway.
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
You certainly do.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanki.
He seemed worried.	Payqa llakisqa hinam karqa.
Which was true, really true.	Imataq chiqap karqa, chiqap chiqap.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
It wouldn’t have been easy.	Manam facilchu kanman karqa.
Probably a lot of things.	Yaqapaschá achka imakuna.
I couldn’t do it.	Manam atirqanichu.
Insurance should be insurance.	Seguro nisqa seguro kanan.
He would love to talk.	Payqa anchatam munanman rimayta.
I want to do the right thing.	Munani chay allin ruwayta.
Isn’t it beautiful?.	¿Manachu sumaq?.
There is no one here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas kanchu.

Now is the time!.	¡Kunanmi chay tiempo!.
That it should be there.	Chaypi kananta.
Good day to you.	Allin punchaw qampaq.
Every morning was bad.	Sapa paqarinmi mana allinchu karqa.
I would rather not do it.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana ruwayqa.
I wish it was here.	Munaymanmi kaypi kanman.
But nothing about it.	Ichaqa manan imapas chaymantaqa.
He says he would love to go.	Payqa anchatam munanman riyta nin.
No one knows exactly why.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan imarayku chaytaqa.
He’s been there a long time.	Payqa unayñan chaypi kashan.
He was obviously excited.	Sut’inmi payqa kusisqa kasharqan.
Everything was pretty good.	Tukuy imapas allin allinmi karqa.
Maybe it’s too fast.	Ichapas ancha utqaylla kasqanmanta.
Both are very difficult.	Iskayninkum ancha sasa.
You certainly know that.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa yachanki.
He said that they were.	Payqa nirqam chayna kasqankuta.
He knows exactly what he is going to do.	Payqa allintam yachan ima ruwananta.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
But it’s okay.	Ichaqa allinmi kachkan.
Yes it should be.	Arí chayna kanan tiyan.
Maybe you want to be honest with him.	Ichapas paywan chiqap rimayta munanki.
This was not the first time.	Kayqa manam ñawpaq kutichu karqa.
I was pretty sure of that.	Yaqapaschá chaymantaqa seguro karqani.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan chayqa.
He was that good.	Payqa chayna allinmi karqa.
Last night.	Qayna tuta.
What are you doing now.	Imatataq kunan ruwanki.
I want to be this.	Munani kayta.
He noticed it.	Payqa repararqanmi.
He looked very unhappy.	Payqa ancha mana kusisqam rikchakurqa.
I didn't want to come so fast.	Manam chayna utqaylla hamuyta munarqanichu.
I did that, but not anymore.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani, ichaqa manañam.
I know that every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi yachani.
Why not? 	Imanasqa mana?
I couldn’t do it.	Manam atirqanichu.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
Which looks good, actually.	Imataq allin rikchakun, chiqaptaqa.
It went well.	Allinmi rirqa.
What’s going on here? 	¿Imataq kaypi kachkan?
. . . .	.
She was as nervous as both of them.	Payqa iskayninku hinan mancharisqa kasharqan.
Not sure about this.	Mana segurochu kaymanta.
It’s more interesting, actually.	Aswan sumaqmi, chiqaptaqa.
But I’m so glad he did.	Ichaqa anchatan kusikuni chayta ruwasqanmanta.
It is still a beautiful day.	Kunankamapas sumaq punchawmi.
Then do what you want.	Chaymanta ruway munasqaykita.
He is not up to it.	Payqa manan chayman hinachu kashan.
But here it is.	Ichaqa kaypi.
Everything is fine, everything is good.	Tukuy imapas allinmi, tukuy imapas allinmi.
I think that’s a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi nispaymi yuyaykuni.
But not much yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi anchatachu.
Sad but true.	Llakisqa ichaqa chiqap.
You can’t say that.	Manan chaytaqa niyta atiwaqchu.
But he would have done that.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwanman karqan.
I wanted to know more.	Astawan yachayta munarqani.
It didn't matter about anything.	Manam imamantapas imananpaschu karqa.
He’s not alone in this, either.	Payqa manan sapallanchu kaypi, nitaq.
Which is the third big.	Imataq kimsa kaq hatun.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
It’s very unpleasant.	Ancha mana sumaqmi.
He couldn’t pretend not to.	Payqa manan mana hinachu ruwayta atirqanchu.
He did something about it.	Payqa imatapas ruwarqa.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
He had to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanan karqan.
He's very badly injured.	Payqa ancha sinchitan k'irisqa kashan.
Probably that’s all.	Yaqapaschá chaylla.
I had to do something.	Imapas ruwanay karqa.
But it’s not very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu.
He looks very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa hinam rikchakun.
He’s a really good guy, you know.	Payqa chiqap allin runam, yachanki.
He still wants to.	Payqa hinallam munan.
He was happy with the result.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan chay ruwasqanmanta.
To be able to do so.	Chayna kananpaq.
There is nothing left, nothing.	Manañam imapas kanchu, manañam.
Not likely to be the case.	Manan chay hinachu kanman yaqapaschá.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Just like today.	Imayna kunan punchaw hina.
Maybe it’s not a good thing.	Ichapas mana allinchu kanman.
Tom knew where he was.	Tomqa yacharqanmi maypi kasqanmanta.
What a day, what a day.	Ima punchaw, ima punchaw.
He didn’t want anything.	Payqa manan imatapas munarqanchu.
It can’t be any other way.	Manan huk hinachu kanman.
It may not always have been, but it is now.	Manapaschá sapa kutichu chayna karqa, kunanmi ichaqa chayna kachkan.
We are very good at it.	Ancha allinmi kanchik.
The process was a success.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqan.

I’m not sure though.	Manam segurochu kani ichaqa.
I knew it was going to happen.	Yacharqanim chayna kananta.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allin runam karqa.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
But he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I'm still not sure.	Kunankamapas manam segurochu kani.
A great one.	Huk hatun.

Now wouldn’t be the first time.	Kunanqa manan ñawpaq kutichu kanman.
The man did it.	Chay runam chayta ruwarqa.
It certainly would be.	Chiqaptam chayna kanman.
I don’t like that.	Chayqa manan gustanchu.
I didn’t think about it.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu.
Now, you probably want to be alone.	Kunanqa, yaqapaschá sapallayki kayta munanki.
I don't want to believe that.	Chaytaqa manam creeyta munanichu.
Yes, it will be very good.	Arí, ancha allinmi kanqa.
It was supposed to be good.	Allinmi kanan karqa.
Indeed, he is.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa.
There is no time.	Manam tiempo kanchu.
But it probably was.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá karqan.
It just wouldn’t be right.	Chaylla mana allinchu kanman.
Alone with him.	Paywan sapallan.
However, this is actually not always a good thing.	Ichaqa, chiqaptaqa manam sapa kutichu kayqa allin.
I’m not really anything.	Manam chiqaptachu imapas kani.
I’ve always wanted it too much.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi llumpayta munarqani.
It was, after all, a lonely day.	Chayqa, tukuy imamanta, sapallan p’unchawmi karqan.
I’d be angry.	Phiñasqa kayman.
Describe the experiences.	Willay imakuna pasasqanmanta.
Like the day before.	Ñawpaq p’unchaw hina.
He has always been like that.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
Everything was great.	Tukuy imapas ancha allinmi karqa.
He was like an unreal person.	Mana chiqap runa hinam karqa.
I want to know about it.	Chaymanta yachayta munani.
He knows what he’s going to do.	Payqa yachanmi ima ruwananta.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu.
I don’t know anything, anymore.	Manañam imatapas yachanichu, manañam.
It would be better than nothing.	Mana imamantapas aswan allinmi kanman.
I was, all right.	Ñuqaqa karqani, allinmi.
He’s doing well.	Payqa allinmi kachkan.
I'll be fine.	Allinmi kasaq.
But this is a very good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha allinmi.
What is three.	Imataq kimsa.
I knew what was going to happen that night.	Yacharqanim chay tuta imakuna pasananta.
He was very, very human.	Payqa ancha, ancha runam karqa.
I don't know what's wrong.	Manam yachanichu ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
He seemed very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
I just didn’t know how.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imaynatachus chayta.
It had been like that for a long time.	Unayñan chay hina kasqa.
I know you do that.	Yachanim chayta ruwasqaykita.
I didn’t think of that.	Mana chayta yuyaykurqanichu.
If you want to.	Munaspaqa.
That would have been a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman karqa.
That it just happened.	Chaylla chayna pasasqanmanta.
He is not sure.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan.
It was a really hard day.	Chiqap sasa punchawmi karqa.
It will continue to be.	Hinallam kanqa.
But he was right.	Ichaqa allintan niwarqan.
. . . .	.
But this was not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allinchu karqan.
Not really looking forward to that.	Mana chiqaptachu chayta suyachkani.
He is not happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kashan.
Every day but today was good.	Sapa punchawmi ichaqa kunan punchawmi allin karqa.
Make it something you can do.	Imapas ruwanaykipaq hina ruway.
Now, .	Kunanqa, .
If not, you’ll find out soon enough.	Mana chayqa, usqhayllan yachanki.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
I still really want to work.	Kunankamapas anchatam llamkayta munani.
It did the job well.	Chayqa allintam chay llamkayta ruwarqa.
That was really nice.	Chayqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
What is?.	¿Imataq?.
He was very happy, he said.	Payqa ancha kusisqam karqa, nispa.
But something isn’t right.	Ichaqa imapas manam allinchu.
He seemed almost sad.	Yaqa llakisqa hinam karqa.
Do it again.	Hukmanta ruway.
Hopefully that means something to you.	Munaymanmi chayqa imapas qampaq niyta munan.
It was good, very good.	Allinmi karqa, ancha allinmi karqa.
Not two nights.	Mana iskay tuta.
He was not to be alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu kanan karqan.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
This means two things.	Kayqa iskay ima niyta munan.
But he learns quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan yachan.
Instead of .	Chaymantaqa .
It looked as good as new.	Musuq hina allinmi rikchakurqa.
Maybe he really did.	Ichapas chiqaptapuni chayta ruwarqa.
He will probably do it.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanqa.
He’s good at that.	Payqa allinmi chayna.
But he knows it won’t come.	Ichaqa yachanmi mana hamunanta.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He'll do it tomorrow.	Paqarinmi ruwanqa.
That was a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi karqa.
Now, however, he was afraid.	Kunanmi ichaqa mancharisqa kasqa.
But nothing is ever that simple.	Ichaqa manan imapas hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu.
But this was not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu karqan.
But that seems to be the case.	Ichaqa chayqa kanman hinan.
I think there is a great truth here.	Kaypiqa hatun chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
Ten days late.	Chunka punchaw tarde.
Like last year.	Qayna wata hina.
I want to talk to him now.	Kunanmi paywan rimayta munani.
Maybe it’s me.	Ichapas ñuqaqa kanman.
I'm not sure why this happened.	Manam segurochu kani imanasqa kay pasasqanmanta.
It’s actually good.	Chiqaptaqa allinmi.
He is no longer good.	Payqa manañam allinchu.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
I didn’t want to be there.	Manam chaypi kaytaqa munarqanichu.
That was the only thing that happened.	Chayqa hinallam karqa.
Too much, too fast.	Ancha achka, ancha utqaylla.
One day, maybe.	Huk punchaw, ichapas.
Do whatever you want with me.	Ruway munasqaykita ñuqawan.
But it would be nice.	Ichaqa allinmi kanman.
You may not know much about something.	Imamantapas manapaschá anchatachu yachanki.
What is the	Imataq chay .
But maybe it’s that good.	Ichaqa ichapas chayna allin kanman.
That’s going to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanqa nispa.
I really really want to say that.	Anchatam anchata munani chayta niyta.
If you don’t want to go there.	Mana chayman riyta munaspaqa.
That’s all, you’re here.	Chaylla, kaypi kachkanki.
This was a great experience.	Kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It’s still true of me, actually.	Hinallam chiqap ñuqamanta, chiqaptaqa.
Now he knows you’re there.	Kunanqa yachanmi chaypi kasqaykita.
I loved it so much.	Anchatam munarqani.
But it certainly was.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
He was always uncomfortable, always tired.	Payqa sapa kutim mana allinchu karqa, sapa kutim sayk’usqa karqa.
Now he was alone.	Kunanqa sapallanmi kasqa.
He certainly did.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
He looks very bad.	Payqa ancha mana allinmi rikchakun.
He had a good day.	Payqa allin punchawmi karqa.
He seemed almost pleased.	Payqa yaqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
They are almost	Paykunaqa yaqa .
That’s what it’s all about.	Chayta nispa.
He is doing very well.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwachkan.
No one is here, he said.	Mana pipas kaypichu, nispa.

I didn’t want to do it either.	Ñuqapas manam ruwayta munarqanichu.
I’m not quite there yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu chaypi kachkani.
So, it was great.	Chayna, ancha allinmi karqa.
This was the case.	Kayqa karqan.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I was really good.	Chiqaptam allin karqani.

He had to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ruwanan karqan.

It’s not a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu.

He doesn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan munanchu chayta ruwayta.
You can’t go to the gym.	Manam riyta atiwaqchu.

But he is not happy.	Ichaqa manan kusisqachu.
Of course, that might not be so good.	Arí, chayqa manapaschá chhayna allinchu kanman.
He couldn't pretend to be nervous here.	Payqa manan kaypiqa mancharisqa hina kayta atirqanchu.
Everyone is very, very nervous.	Lliwmi ancha, ancha mancharisqa kachkanku.

That was the only thing that happened.	Chayqa hinallam karqa.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
That wouldn’t be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanman.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kayqa.
No means no.	Mana niyta munan mana.
He was very angry.	Ancha phiñasqa kasqa.
But that’s what he did.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwarqan.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Can't say what it is.	Mana ima kasqanmanta niyta atinchu.

You have to do it accordingly.	Chayman hinam ruwanayki.

That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Nothing was right.	Manam imapas allinchu karqa.
But then, he was angry.	Ichaqa chaymanta, phiñasqa kasharqan.
You’ll learn quickly.	Usqhayllan yachanki.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
He’s already done it.	Payqa ñam chayta ruwarqa.
But it’s not like it used to be.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu.
You better not do that.	Aswan allinmi mana chayta ruwanaykipaq.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
Both are depressed.	Iskayninkum llakisqa kachkanku.
This is obviously wrong.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.

But yes, he did.	Ichaqa arí, chaytan ruwarqan.
You can’t do this.	Manan kayta ruwayta atiwaqchu.

He looked unsure.	Payqa mana seguro hinam rikchakurqa.
Nothing is easy.	Manan imapas facilchu.

He is always with you.	Payqa tukuy tiempon qanwan kashan.
That’s a good thing, man.	Chayqa allinmi, runa.
Not good, but it could have been worse.	Mana allinchu, ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan.

Almost, but not quite.	Yaqa, ichaqa mana allintachu.

The practice continues today.	Kunankamapas chay ruwayqa hinallam kachkan.

However, it will be good.	Ichaqa, allinmi kanqa.

He was there for the guy.	Payqa chaypi kasqa.

Nobody wants to play with me.	Manam pipas ñuqawan pukllayta munanchu.
In fact, they’re rather unattractive.	Chiqaptaqa, paykunaqa aswan mana sumaqmi kanku.

And he was in a state of shock.	Hinan payqa llakisqa kasharqan.

I want to play the game.	Pukllayta munani.
I want to talk about it.	Chaymanta rimayta munani.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa.

As a married couple.	Huk casarasqa hina.
Maybe one day he will.	Ichapas huk punchaw chayta ruwanman.

Nothing can go wrong.	Manan imapas mana allinchu kanman.

Everything meant no more than one thing.	Tukuy imapas mana hukmanta aswan niyta munarqa.

Maybe more than one.	Ichapas hukmanta aswan achka kanman.
You’re doing well.	Allinmi kachkanki.
But it wasn’t very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu karqan.
Which was fine with him.	Imataq allin karqa paywan.
Which is all right.	Imataq tukuy allin kachkan.
But that was last year.	Ichaqa chayqa karqan qayna wata.

That’s what he did right.	Chaytan allinta ruwarqan.
He can’t do this.	Kaytaqa manan ruwayta atinmanchu.
That’s pretty obvious.	Chayqa ancha sut’inmi.
How about this	Imaynataq kay .
It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
It depends on how good it is.	Imayna allin kasqanmantam kanqa.

Nothing was certain.	Manam imapas segurochu karqa.

There’s almost nothing he won’t do.	Yaqa mana imapas kanchu mana ruwananpaqqa.

This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
Please do this for me.	Ama hina kaspa, kayta ruway.

That was the only thing that happened.	Chayqa hinallam karqa.

He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Maybe they are both.	Ichapas iskayninku kanku.
It is day and night.	Chayqa tuta punchawmi.
I was always the best.	Ñuqaqa sapa kutim aswan allin karqani.
This has been around for a long time.	Kayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi kachkan.

I didn’t see anyone.	Mana pitapas rikurqanichu.
I'm sorry, I don't.	Pampachaykuway, manam.
But that would be a bad thing.	Ichaqa chayqa mana allinchu kanman.

Yeah, they’re tough, okay.	Arí, paykunaqa sinchi kanku, allinmi.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.

He didn’t want to know what happened.	Payqa manan imachus pasasqanmanta yachayta munarqanchu.
There would have been three.	Kimsa kanman karqa.
I didn't think he could.	Manam piensarqanichu atisqanmanta.

Maybe he’s scared.	Ichapas payqa mancharisqa kachkan.
Everyone needs it.	Sapa runam necesitan.
I didn’t want to do this.	Manam kayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
I hope you did better.	Suyachkani aswan allin ruwasqaykita.

Either you knew that or you didn’t.	Icha chayta yacharqanki icha mana.

In fact, it probably is.	Chiqaptaqa, yaqapaschá chayna.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Mana allinchu karqa.
You’re a great guy.	Hatun runam kanki.
Now he is doing better.	Kunanqa aswan allintam ruwachkan.

He was scared and angry.	Payqa mancharisqa, phiñasqa ima kasharqan.

No! 	Manam!
You don’t know what it’s like.	Manam yachankichu imayna kasqanmantaqa.

You just want to do it.	Chaylla ruwayta munanki.
But this was better.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan allinmi karqan.
Probably someone else.	Yaqapaschá huk runa.
That would continue to be the case.	Chayqa hinallam kanman.
You’ll be there for two days.	Iskay punchawmi kanki.
I didn’t want to be that person.	Manam chay runa kaytaqa munarqanichu.
I thought you wanted to know.	Yachayta munasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
I was pretty sure it wasn’t.	Yaqapaschá seguro karqani mana chayna kasqanmanta.
But that’s not what he’s thinking here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu chayta yuyaykushan.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu.
Can you do better?.	¿Atiwaqchu aswan allinta ruwayta?.

But it’s bigger.	Ichaqa aswan hatun.
He can’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
But he does it well.	Ichaqa allintam chaytaqa ruwan.
It looked really good.	Chiqap allinmi rikchakurqa.
I have never seen this before.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa rikurqanichu.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqa.
Yeah, and then some.	Arí, chaymanta wakin.
But one fine day things will go wrong.	Ichaqa huk sumaq punchawmi imapas mana allinchu kanqa.
It was better than nothing.	Mana imamantapas aswan allinmi karqa.
Maybe the second would be better.	Ichapas iskay kaq aswan allin kanman.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
But that would be a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi kanman.
That was the most interesting thing.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi karqa.
I don’t want this to happen.	Manam munanichu kay pasananta.
That’s the best thing here.	Chayqa kaypiqa aswan allinmi.

Everything went wrong, and it still does.	Tukuy imapas mana allintachu rirqa, kunankamapas hinallam kachkan.

He was pretty sure he knew it.	Payqa allintan seguro kasharqan chayta yachasqanmanta.
It’s very, very good.	Ancha ancha allinmi.

I never thought of that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa piensarqanichu.
Nothing new about it.	Manam imapas musuq chaymantaqa.

He doesn’t need to go alone.	Manan sapallanchu riyta necesitan.

That was going to fail.	Chayqa mana allintachu ruwanan karqan.
I’ve done that.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani.
It wasn’t easy.	Manam facilchu karqa.
I don’t know if you know that.	Mana yachanichu chayta yachankichu icha manachu.

No one can do it.	Manan pipas atinmanchu.
But it’s very interesting.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi.
Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi.
He was alone, very lonely.	Payqa sapallanmi kasqa, sinchi sapallanmi kasqa.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
Probably not.	Manapaschá.
If you want to.	Munaspaqa.
He did the right thing.	Payqa allintan ruwarqan.
It certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
But he didn't think so.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa yuyaykurqanchu.
He was unhappily married.	Payqa mana kusisqachu casarasqa karqan.
He didn’t seem worried.	Payqa manan llakisqa hinachu kasqa.

He was a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam karqa.
This was very bad.	Kayqa ancha mana allinmi karqa.
He didn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
It’s tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kachkan.
It doesn't seem right.	Mana allintachu rikchakun.
I really mean that.	Chaytaqa chiqaptam niyta munani.
Otherwise, it’s pretty bad.	Mana chayqa, ancha mana allinchu.

Today will be the best day.	Kunan punchawmi aswan allin punchaw kanqa.
Being a good person.	Allin ruwaq runa kay.

But that’s what he did.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwarqan.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allinchu.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I really can’t.	Chiqaptaqa manam atiymanchu.
You are a sad person.	Llakisqa runam kanki.
You can’t talk about it.	Manam rimayta atiwaqchu.
He doesn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munanchu.
It’s more beautiful.	Aswan sumaqmi.
This is nice, but not very good.	Kayqa sumaqmi, ichaqa manam ancha allinchu.

You’re the one.	Qamqa kanki.
You know, it’s going to be nice.	Yachanki, sumaqmi kanqa.

It’s going to be good.	Allinmi kanqa.
You are so beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanki.

He obviously doesn’t know anything about this.	Sut’inmi kaymanta mana imatapas yachanchu.

That’s what I thought.	Chaytan yuyaykurqani.
He told me exactly what he wanted me to do.	Payqa allintam niwarqa ima ruwanay munasqanmanta.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Almost every day, in fact.	Yaqa sapa punchawmi, chiqaptaqa.
It looks very good.	Ancha allinmi rikchakun.
You’re good at it.	Allinmi kanki chaypi.
Probably not, you know.	Manapaschá, yachanki.
But that wouldn’t have been the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman karqan.
He was still there.	Payqa hinallam karqa.
I’m not a good guy.	Manam allinchu kani.
Not even, either.	Manam nitaq, nitaq.
About three years.	Yaqa kimsa wata.
It makes the game more interesting.	Aswan sumaqmi pukllayta ruwan.
I hope this will be great.	Suyachkani kay hatun kananta.
Maybe he did that.	Ichapas chayta ruwarqa.
I was alone in myself.	Sapallanmi karqani.
He couldn’t be better.	Payqa manan aswan allinchu kanman.
They certainly are.	Cheqaqtapunin paykunaqa kanku.
No one can do this.	Manan pipas kaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
That certainly seemed to be the case now.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin kunanqa kanman hina karqan.
He really wanted to.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin munarqan.
You want to tell.	Willayta munanki.
Is it right for you?.	¿Allinchu qampaq?.
But it probably does.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwan.
He didn’t want to be with her.	Payqa manan paywan kayta munarqanchu.
You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
He doesn’t care why.	Payqa manan imananpaschu imarayku chaytaqa.

Great things all.	Hatun imakuna tukuy.
He said he didn't.	Nirqanmi mana nispa.
It means not worried.	Mana llakisqa niyta munan.

It wouldn’t be the first time.	Manan ñawpaq kutichu kanman karqan.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
That’s next year.	Chayqa hamuq wata.
They are human-like.	Paykunaqa runa hinam kanku.
He never thought he would.	Mana hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu chayta ruwananta.
It really wasn't that bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna mana allinchu karqa.
But he can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwayta atinmanchu.
It says it all really.	Tukuy chayta nin chiqaptapuni.
I like it a lot.	Anchatam gustan.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
That is always very difficult.	Chayqa sapa kutim ancha sasa.
I can’t tell you.	Manam willayta atiymanchu.
He will probably go.	Yaqapaschá payqa rinqa.
It was very human-like.	Ancha runa hinam karqa.
It wasn't the worst.	Manam aswan mana allinchu karqa.
It doesn't matter here.	Kaypiqa manam imananpaschu.

It’s the next day.	Paqarin punchawmi.

But it doesn’t always mean that.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chayta niyta munan.
Otherwise you'll never know.	Mana chayqa manan hayk'aqpas yachankichu.
I think he knows what he’s going to do.	Yuyaykuni ima ruwananta yachan.
That means that the .	Chayqa niyta munan, chay .
But now he was alone.	Ichaqa kunanqa sapallanmi kasqa.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
I thought that was more time.	Chayqa aswan tiempo kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Surely someone wanted to be first.	Cheqaqtapunin ñawpaqtaqa pipas kayta munarqan.
However, this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa, kayqa manam allinchu.

That's obvious.	Chayqa sut'inmi.
That’s a good thing though.	Chayqa allinmi ichaqa.
He seemed very upset.	Payqa ancha llakisqa hinam karqa.
It doesn’t matter.	Manan imananpaschu.
He didn’t want to be there.	Payqa manan chaypi kayta munarqanchu.
I know he won't.	Yachanim mana ruwananta.
You wouldn’t want it for anyone.	Manam pimanpas munawaqchu.

But he didn’t want that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa munarqanchu.
Probably not, but maybe.	Manapaschá, ichaqa ichapas.

No one knows about it.	Manam pipas chaymantaqa yachanchu.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
That’s a man.	Chayqa runa.

But he knew where he was.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta.
He couldn’t have done that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
I think he is a great guy.	Payqa hatun runa kasqanmantam piensani.
Otherwise, it’s not.	Mana chayqa, manan.

Of course, it’s not always that simple.	Arí, manan sapa kutichu chay hina facilchu.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
I don't care what he's going to do.	Manam imananpaschu imakuna ruwananmanta.
Another great achievement.	Huk hatun ruway.
He didn’t know what was wrong with him.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus paywan kashasqanmanta.

Then another, then another.	Chaymanta huk, chaymanta huk.
It’s just so beautiful.	Chaylla ancha sumaqmi.
That’s always the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim.

I couldn’t believe it at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan creeyta atirqanichu.
It didn’t seem to be much good anymore.	Manaña ancha allinchu kanman hina karqan.
He would love for that to happen.	Payqa anchatan munanman chay pasananta.
But it’s not really like that.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chhayna.

He saw it as an opportunity.	Chaytaqa huk oportunidadta hinan qhawarirqan.

That was a big maybe.	Chayqa hatun ichapas karqa.
That’s obviously wrong.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.

Here are a few.	Kaypi huk iskay kimsa.
I know it's wrong.	Yachanim mana allin kasqanmanta.
I didn't think it would happen.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kananta.
It was a very beautiful day.	Ancha sumaq punchawmi karqa.

Maybe it’s something similar.	Ichapas chayna kaq imapas kanman.
I've never been here before.	Manam haykapipas kaypichu karqani.
However, this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
There's a guy.	Chaypi kaq.
He’s the best in his position.	Payqa aswan allinmi maypi kasqanpi.
Obviously, it’s not.	Sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu.
He was really hurting.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin k’irisqa kasharqan.
He said that he did.	Payqa nirqam chayna ruwasqanmanta.
But they are not like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanku.
He is not well now.	Payqa kunanqa manam allinchu.
Do it, do it now!.	Ruway, kunan ruway!.
I didn’t think anything of it, you know.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yuyaykurqanichu, yachanki.

He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa.

It’s really nice.	Chiqap sumaqmi.
Maybe you’re the one.	Ichapas chayna kanki.
Surely everything would be fine now.	Cheqaqtapunin kunanqa tukuy imapas allin kanman.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
. . . .	.
You know that’s what you know.	Chayta yachanki.
The wrong thing to do.	Mana allinta ruway.
I mean, the second one.	Niyta munani, iskay kaq.

He can’t do this.	Kaytaqa manan ruwayta atinmanchu.

That would have been the.	Chayqa kanman karqan chay.

More like a smile.	Aswan hina.
It’s obvious.	Sut’inmi kashan.
I hope he does well.	Suyachkani allinta ruwananta.
I think he knew.	Yuyaykuni payqa yacharqanmi.
Obviously that’s not going to work.	Sut’inmi chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
That was today.	Chayqa kunan punchawmi karqa.
He could have been better.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan.
That was just that.	Chayqa chayraqmi karqan.
He thought it was the right thing to do.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chay ruway allin kananpaq.
Can't work maybe.	Mana llamk'ayta atinchu ichapas.
I know that’s a good thing.	Chaytaqa allintan yachani.
If he can’t, it’s too bad.	Mana atinchu chayqa, ancha mana allinmi.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
Maybe it’s something else.	Ichapas huk imapas kanman.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I didn’t want it or want it.	Manam munarqanichu nitaq munarqanichu.

He was such a man.	Chayna runam karqa.
For about ten years.	Yaqa chunka wata.
I really want to be just that.	Anchatan munani chaylla kayta.

This was probably a very good thing.	Kayqa yaqapaschá ancha allin karqa.
But it wasn’t the best.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu karqan.
That’s not a bad thing.	Chayqa manan mana allinchu.
Here’s the first one.	Kaypi ñawpaq kaq.
He told the story well.	Payqa allintan willarqan.
After all, someone has to do it.	Tukuy imamanta, pipas ruwanan tiyan.

But, it looks good.	Ichaqa, allinmi rikchakun.
It’s a good day.	Allin punchawmi.
No, that’s a good thing.	Manan, chayqa allinmi.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.
That was the only thing that happened.	Chayqa hinallam karqa.
I hope he doesn't get hurt.	Suyachkani mana k'irisqa kananpaq.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
You do it all the time.	Qamqa sapa kutim ruwanki.
I sure hope he does.	Seguro suyachkani chayta ruwananpaq.
But it’s probably.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá.
That’s probably the single biggest thing.	Chayqa ichapas sapallan aswan hatun kaq.
He doesn’t know yet.	Payqa manaraqmi yachanchu.
I think you want that.	Chayta munasqaykita yuyani.
It’s not easy, in this city.	Manam facilchu, kay llaqtapi.
He refused to talk.	Payqa manan rimayta munarqanchu.
Better to be sure.	Aswan allinmi seguro kay.
He didn't know what to do.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.
It’s always something.	Sapa kutim imapas.
He didn’t do everything right.	Payqa manam tukuy imatapas allintachu ruwarqa.

He doesn't know why.	Payqa manam yachanchu imanasqa chaytaqa.

It’s actually pretty interesting.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi.
But it wasn’t easy to do.	Ichaqa manan facilchu karqan chayta ruwayqa.
I thought everything was that fast.	Yuyarqanim tukuy imapas chay utqaylla kasqanmanta.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
The bad thing is.	Mana allin kaq.
Yes, it certainly does.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.

I wish you were here with us.	Munaymanmi kaypi ñuqaykuwan kasqaykita.

I mean now, you know, today.	Niyta munani kunan, yachanki, kunan punchaw.
There is nothing about it.	Chaymantaqa manam imapas kanchu.

It was a lonely one.	Chayqa sapallanmi karqa.
He had to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan karqan.

You’ll be happier.	Aswan kusisqam kanki.
He wasn’t sure.	Payqa manan segurochu kasqa.
I'm not sure.	Manam segurochu kani.
He can't do anything.	Mana imatapas ruwayta atinchu.

He doesn’t exist.	Payqa manan kanchu.
But it was very bad.	Ichaqa ancha mana allinmi karqa.
That was actually great.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It’s not going to be that way.	Manan chay hinachu kanqa.
It was better than that.	Aswan allinmi karqan.
Do this.	Ruway kay.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
He wanted to do something wrong.	Imapas mana allinta ruwayta munarqa.
I couldn’t be sure.	Manam seguro kayta atirqanichu.

But, be a good person.	Ichaqa, allin runa kay.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
I couldn't believe it was happening.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu chayna kasqanmantaqa.
Maybe it would be good.	Ichapas allin kanman.
He can’t help it.	Payqa manan yanapayta atinchu.
It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
I couldn’t do it.	Manam ruwayta atirqanichu.

I didn’t think it would work.	Manam piensarqanichu allin kananta.

But no, not really.	Ichaqa manan, cheqaqtachu.
It might not be so bad now.	Manapaschá kunanqa chhayna mana allinchu kanman.

There is no other way you can do that.	Manan huk ruwayqa kanchu chayta ruwanaykipaq.

Yes, it is.	Arí, chayna.
But he can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan ruwayta atinmanchu.

I'd rather collaborate with you here.	Aswan allinmi kanman kaypi qanwan kuska llamk'ayta.
I don't really know why that is.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.

But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kayqa.
I don't know why that is.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But someone was there.	Ichaqa pipas chaypi kasqa.
He will do that today.	Chaytaqa kunan punchawmi ruwanqa.
He was a bit of a loner.	Payqa huk chhikantan sapallan karqan.
He was happy here.	Payqa kaypi kusisqa kasqa.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
It just never worked out.	Chaylla mana hayk’aqpas allinchu karqan.
Is that really the case though.	¿Cheqaqtachu chayna ichaqa.
I know he is home.	Yachanim wasinpi kasqanmanta.

Maybe one day it will.	Ichapas huk punchaw chayna kanman.
But he had no idea how to do it.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imaynatachus ruwananta.
You can’t be this.	Manam kayta atiwaqchu.

If you know the answer.	Sichus yachanki chayqa.

It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
You’re going to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwanki.
That was the way it was at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa chayna hinam karqa.

Surely tomorrow would be better.	Cheqaqtapunin paqarin p’unchay aswan allin kanman.
Yes, as a matter of fact.	Arí, chiqap hina.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
Maybe he did that.	Ichapas chayta ruwarqa.
But something was wrong.	Ichaqa imapas mana allinchu karqa.
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.
I'm sure it doesn't mean that.	Seguro kani mana chayta niyta munanchu.

Now it’s okay.	Kunanqa allinmi.

I'll do that.	Chaytaqa ruwasaq.
He can no longer speak.	Manaña rimayta atinchu.
He didn’t want to talk about it.	Payqa manan chaymanta rimayta munarqanchu.
He probably would have.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanman karqan.
I really want that to happen.	Anchatam munani chayna kananta.
Both were excellent.	Iskayninkum ancha allin karqa.
Yes, that seems like a foregone conclusion.	Arí, chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi rikchakun.

That was quite something.	Chayqa ancha imapas karqa.
Okay, that’s a good thing.	Allinmi, chayqa allinmi.

It wouldn’t be any other way.	Mana huk hinachu kanman.
He had to be sure.	Payqa seguro kanan karqan.
He was truly the nicest person.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin aswan sumaq runa karqan.
He wants to work.	Payqa llamkayta munan.
This, however, is not a good thing.	Kayqa ichaqa manan allinchu.
It doesn’t matter, it doesn’t.	Manam imananpaschu, manañam.
He is very happy.	Ancha kusisqam kachkan.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
It just can’t be done.	Chaylla mana atinchu.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.

This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
What is it, is it.	Imataq kachkan, kachkan.
What is happening now.	Kunan imakuna pasasqanmanta.
He didn’t always do that, anymore.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwaq, manañan.
You can’t say that.	Manam chaytaqa rimayta atiwaqchu.
That means there is a reality.	Chayqa niyta munan huk chiqap kasqanmanta.
I don’t know how it is.	Manam yachanichu imayna kasqanmanta.
But that wouldn’t be the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu kanman.
That’s what I’m so excited about.	Chayqa anchatam kusikuni.
Now here’s the hard part.	Kunanqa kaypi sinchi kaq.
Do it right.	Allinta ruway.
I never thought it would happen.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna kasqanmanta.
Actually, he was right.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa allintam nirqa.
That's obviously wrong.	Chayqa sut'inmi mana allinchu.
But you know it well.	Ichaqa allintan yachanki.
He’s better than that.	Payqa chaymantaqa aswan allinmi.
Everything is happy.	Tukuy imapas kusisqam kachkan.
First of all, it’s beautiful.	Ñawpaqtaqa sumaqmi.
I knew what it would be like.	Yacharqanim imayna kananta.
It’s accordingly.	Chayman hinam.
It’s never a good thing.	Manam haykapipas allinchu.
There is no better way to do it.	Manan aswan allin ruwayqa kanchu.
But it’s really good.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin allin.
All right that way, maybe.	Allinmi chayna, ichapas.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqa.
But he doesn’t want to be here.	Ichaqa manan kaypi kayta munanchu.
I didn't want to work there anymore.	Manañam chaypi llamkayta munarqanichu.

I didn’t see anyone.	Manam pitapas rikurqanichu.
I was with him the whole time.	Tukuy tiempon paywan karqani.
He is not happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kashan.
He couldn’t do anything about it.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
This is obvious.	Kayqa sut’inmi.
He seems like a nice guy.	Sumaq runa hinam rikchakun.
It shouldn’t be a good thing.	Manam allinchu kanan.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
It may not be the case.	Manapaschá chay hinachu kanman.
He is very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.

Here’s about it .	Kaypiqa chaymanta .
He doesn’t want to be alone.	Payqa manam sapallan kayta munanchu.
If you’re not happy, we’re not happy.	Mana kusisqachu kanki chayqa, manan kusisqachu kayku.
He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I think he expected that.	Chayta suyakusqanmanta yuyaykuni.
That’s not a good thing anymore.	Chayqa manañam allinchu.
However, it’s not quite.	Ichaqa, manan allintachu.
I'm injured.	K'irisqa kani.
Maybe it was there all along.	Ichapas tukuy tiempo chaypi karqa.
How could he do that.	Imaynatataq chayta ruwanman karqa.
All right, all right.	Allinmi, allinmi.
But it was a good thing.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan chayqa.
But he couldn't tell her that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa willayta atirqanchu.
That or nothing.	Chayqa icha mana imapas.
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa atiymanchu.
He was such a tough guy.	Payqa chayna sinchi runam karqa.
No, it’s not a good thing.	Manan, manan allinchu.
I don’t know what to do.	Manam yachanichu imata ruwanayta.
Actually, it’s not very good.	Chiqaptaqa, mana ancha allinchu.
But it doesn’t seem like the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan allinchu rikch’akun chay ruwayqa.
It looked beautiful.	Sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
This doesn't mean anything.	Kayqa manam imatapas niyta munanchu.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
I'm a little busy.	Ñuqaqa huk chikan ocupasqa kachkani.
Above all else.	Tukuy imamanta aswan hatun.
Obviously this is so.	Sut’inmi kayqa chhayna kasqanmanta.
This means the former.	Kayqa ñawpaq kaq niyta munan.
I'm sure he is.	Seguro kani payqa kasqanmanta.
He knows what it’s all about.	Payqa yachanmi imamanta kasqanmanta.
I don't know what to do about it.	Manam yachanichu chaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
Now, at least.	Kunanqa, aswan pisi.
But you never know.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu.

I am, of course.	Ñuqapas kani, sut’inmi.
It's all about what's important to you.	Tukuy imapas qampaq imakuna ancha allin kasqanmantam.
There, that’s a good guy.	Chaypi, chayqa allin runa.
He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam karqa.
Now you never can.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas atiwaqchu.
He was very tired.	Payqa llumpay sayk’usqa kasqa.

No one can do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
You want to.	Munanki.

That should be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanan.
Which is the truth.	Imataq chiqap kasqanmanta.
I don’t like that.	Chayqa manam gustanchu.
Very good.	Aswan allinmi.
He was badly injured.	Payqa sinchitan k’irisqa karqan.
Now you have to do it.	Kunanqa ruwanayki tiyan.

If you know what you need to do, do it.	Ima ruwanaykita yachanki chayqa, ruway.
Happy birthday early.	Kusisqa p'unchaw temprano.

But that was not the case at the time.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I know exactly how it is.	Yachanim allinta imayna kasqanmanta.
One, two, three weeks.	Huk, iskay, kimsa semana.
But nothing seems right.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu rikchakun.

It will probably be all day.	Yaqapaschá tukuy punchaw kanqa.
This was not always a good thing.	Kayqa manam sapa kutichu allin karqa.
What do you think is the biggest thing?.	¿Imataq aswan hatun kasqanmanta yuyanki?.
I was tired all day.	Tukuy punchawmi sayk’usqa karqani.
I never wanted that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa munarqanichu.
I always did that.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwaq kani.
That seems to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi rikchakun.
You’ll learn quickly.	Usqhayllan yachanki.
But it’s better now than nothing.	Ichaqa aswan allinmi kunan mana imamantapas.
Things did not go well.	Imapas manam allintachu rirqa.
But, maybe not.	Ichaqa, ichapas mana.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
He didn’t say that exactly.	Payqa manan chayta allintachu nisqa.

I mean everything is like that.	Tukuy imapas chayna kasqanmantam niyta munani.
This means something is wrong.	Kayqa imapas mana allin kasqanmantam niyta munan.

But, it’s not really.	Ichaqa, manan cheqaqtachu.
Everyone, however .	Tukuy runa ichaqa .

He did it all the time.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim ruwarqa.
That was his name.	Chayqa sutinmi kasqa.
You’re doing a good job.	Allintam ruwanki.
Maybe there was something there.	Ichapas chaypi imapas karqa.
He knew what this was about.	Payqa yacharqanmi imamanta kayqa kasqanmanta.
I never saw that not happening.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu chayna mana pasananta.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I ask myself very often.	Ancha sapa kutim tapukuni.
I know how bad it is.	Yachanim imayna mana allin kasqanmanta.
He’ll do it.	Payqa ruwanqa.
He couldn’t get over it.	Payqa manan chayta atipayta atirqanchu.
Everything seemed so difficult.	Tukuy imapas ancha sasa hinam karqa.
Yes, he looked a little annoyed.	Arí, huk chikan phiñasqa hinam rikchakurqa.

He had been around for a long time.	Payqa unayñan kasqa.

Maybe someone did it.	Ichapas pipas chayta ruwarqa.
It wasn’t the best.	Manam aswan allinchu karqa.
That’s a very bad thing.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi kasqa.
Perhaps it does.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwan.
Everyone is tired.	Lliwmi sayk'usqa kachkanku.
This was as it should be.	Kayqa imayna kanan hinam karqa.
It was a difficult day.	Sasa punchawmi karqa.

Why do you want someone else to be.	¿Imanasqataq munanki huk runa kananta.
You want to tell that story.	Chay willayta willayta munanki.
If you know, or not.	Sichus yachanki, icha mana.
You’re doing a good job.	Allintam ruwanki.
If he has done so.	Sichus chayta ruwarqan chayqa.
I wonder how that would have happened.	Tapukuni imaynataq chay kanman karqa.
That wasn’t a bad thing.	Chayqa manam mana allinchu karqa.
He was never bad.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas mana allinchu karqan.
But it’s very interesting.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi.
He would be angry.	Payqa phiñasqa kanman.
Actually, it was worse.	Chiqaptaqa, aswan mana allinmi karqa.
He can't do anything.	Mana imatapas ruwayta atinchu.
It almost seemed like he wanted to play.	Yaqapaschá pukllayta munanman hina karqa.
It’s not the easiest.	Manan aswan facilchu.
That would be a bad thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa mana allinchu kanman.
He was very nice to me.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqawan karqa.

I really think he was scared.	Chiqaptam piensani mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
He’s alone.	Sapallanmi.
He doesn’t want to believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta munanchu.
I didn’t know that.	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu.

He doesn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa munanchu.

Forgive me, now.	Pampachaykuway, kunan.
But that doesn’t always have to be the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanan.

Yes, that's obvious.	Arí, chayqa sut'inmi.
Obviously, this wouldn’t work.	Sut’inmi, kayqa manan allinchu kanman.
That would not have worked at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas allinchu kanman karqan.
I couldn’t play the game.	Manam pukllayta atirqanichu.

Maybe he said he did.	Ichapas chayna ruwasqanmanta nirqa.
But he didn’t think of anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas yuyaykurqanchu.
I hope you never do.	Suyachkani mana haykapipas ruwanaykipaq.

This is the worst.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi.

But he can’t do it alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu chaytaqa ruwanman.

Everything is always a maybe.	Tukuy imapas sapa kutim huk ichapas.

It’s not good for you.	Mana allinchu qampaq.
I’m sure it wouldn’t have been easy.	Seguro kani mana facilchu kanman karqan.
But it’s a human being.	Ichaqa huk runa.
He had to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanan karqan.
Not so much, maybe.	Mana anchatachu, ichapas.
He wanted to do this well.	Payqa allintam kayta ruwayta munarqa.

Nothing can go wrong.	Manan imapas mana allinchu kanman.

This was a wonderful experience.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I am not so sure.	Manam chayna segurochu kani.
Maybe you need to do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanayki kanqa.
If something is wrong, it is wrong.	Sichus imapas mana allinchu chayqa, manan allinchu.

That’s what he needs.	Chaytan necesitan.

He was not supposed to be happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu kanan karqan.

I don't know that to be true.	Chaytaqa manam yachanichu chiqap kananpaq.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.

Is it right or wrong?.	¿Allinchu icha manachu?.
It won't last very long, at all events.	Mana ancha unaytachu kanqa, tukuy imapipas.

Where is he now.	Maypi kunan kachkan.

I have to do it right.	Allinta ruwanay tiyan.
He is here alone.	Payqa sapallanmi kaypi kachkan.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu.

However, it is not.	Ichaqa, manan chay hinachu.
That’s what I think.	Chaytan yuyaykuni.

That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
I know all about it.	Tukuy chaymanta yachani.
He is truly successful.	Cheqaqtapunin allin ruwaq.
However, it actually greatly speeds up the process.	Ichaqa, chiqaptaqa anchatam chay ruwayta utqaylla ruwan.
But you will need to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanayki kanqa.
Not a bad thing.	Mana mana allintachu.

I don't think it's true.	Mana chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
Maybe it will fail again.	Ichapas hukmanta mana allintachu ruwanman.
He hadn’t been here in a long time.	Unayñan mana kaypichu kasqa.
But no, that wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan, chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
It’s too bad, you can’t.	Llumpay mana allinmi, manam atiwaqchu.
Why is that the case?.	¿Imanasqataq chayna?.

He seemed more frightened than angry.	Payqa aswan mancharisqa hinan karqan phiñasqa kasqanmantaqa.

That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.

He would have to do this very quickly.	Payqa kayta ancha utqaylla ruwanan kanman karqa.

That’s because he didn’t do it right.	Chayqa mana allinta ruwasqanmanta.
Maybe someone else.	Ichapas huk runa.
I'm really looking forward to this.	Kaytaqa anchatam suyachkani.
But it was worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.

You’re new in town.	Llaqtapi musuq kanki.

Nothing was right here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas allinchu karqa.

Will it be a good idea?.	¿Allinchu kanqa?.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.

However, this is not a very effective approach.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa ancha allinchu.
If you do, then it would be good.	Sichus chayta ruwanki chayqa, chaymantaqa allinmi kanman.
Something is better than nothing.	Imapas aswan allinmi mana imamantapas.

Of course, he knew he wasn't alone.	Arí, payqa yacharqanmi mana sapallan kasqanmanta.

Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
In fact, they’re the worst.	Chiqaptaqa, paykunaqa aswan mana allinmi kanku.

He didn't seem right.	Payqa mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
I couldn’t say what it was.	Manam niyta atirqanichu ima kasqanmanta.
But you have to do it right.	Ichaqa allintan ruwanayki.
He had to continue.	Payqa hinallam kanan karqa.
He doesn’t want to.	Payqa manan munanchu.
Now, there is no one.	Kunanqa, manam pipas kanchu.
That’s never a good thing.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu.

He could be here tomorrow.	Payqa paqarinmi kaypi kanman.
He was busy.	Payqa ocupasqa kasharqan.
Here’s one, here’s another.	Kaypi huk, kaypi huk.
If someone wants to do something on their own, that’s fine.	Sichus pipas sapallan imatapas ruwayta munan chayqa, allinmi.
Yes, it would be.	Arí, chayna kanman.
I like it quickly.	Utqaylla gustan.
I know you do that.	Yachanim chayta ruwasqaykita.
But he knows it.	Ichaqa yachanmi.
He knew what it would be like.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna kananta.
It was obvious that it wasn’t right.	Sut’inmi karqan mana allinchu kashasqanmanta.
It wouldn’t be the first time.	Manan ñawpaq kutichu kanman.
It would be very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi kanman.
Things should be interesting here.	Kaypiqa imapas sumaqmi kanan.

You are a very good person.	Qamqa ancha allin runam kanki.

But someone did it.	Ichaqa pipas chaytan ruwarqan.
Either that, or he doesn’t exist.	Icha chay, icha payqa mana kanchu.
I can’t say it.	Manam niyta atiymanchu.
This thing here.	Kay imapas kaypi.
But it’s not easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu.

This process does.	Kay ruwayqa ruwan.
I hope he does well.	Suyachkani allinta ruwananta.
That’s something.	Chayqa imapas.
Now, he wasn’t so sure.	Kunanqa, manan chay hina segurochu kasqa.

Tomorrow is a day.	Paqarin huk punchaw.
But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
Maybe it won’t last long.	Ichapas mana unaytachu kanman.
But then that’s it.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa chay.
Everything you have to do.	Tukuy ima ruwanayki tiyan.
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
Other than that, it could have been anyone.	Mana chaymantaqa, pipas kanman karqan.
I want him to succeed.	Munani allinta ruwananta.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
I thought I wouldn’t.	Mana nispaymi yuyaykurqani.
I really want to know.	Anchatam yachayta munani.
He knew what he was doing.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwasqanmanta.

It shouldn’t be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan.
Maybe it’s true.	Ichapas chiqap kanman.
That would have been the case.	Chayna kanman karqa.
This is how it will be.	Kay hinam kanqa.
He knows better than he does.	Payqa aswan allintam yachan.

I think he knows better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinta yachan, nispan yuyaykuni.
This was the case.	Kayqa karqan.

Then next week.	Chaymanta hamuq semana.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
I'm afraid I won't.	Manchakuni mana.
Is it right?.	¿Allinchu?.
A quick one.	Huk utqaylla.
This doesn't seem right.	Kayqa mana allinchu rikchakun.
All day, all night.	Tukuy punchaw, tukuy tuta.
I want to talk to him.	Paywan rimayta munani.
Not easy to do, for sure.	Mana facilchu ruway, seguro.
It’s not there anymore.	Manañam kachkan.

I didn’t know where he was.	Manam yacharqanichu maypi kasqanmanta.
I couldn't believe it.	Chaytaqa manam creeyta atirqanichu.
Everyone is happy.	Lliwmi kusisqa kachkanku.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
I’m not very good at it.	Manam ancha allinchu kani.
It was a little lonely.	Chayqa huk chikan sapallanmi karqa.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Kaypiqa manam imapas mana allinchu.
It doesn't really mean.	Mana chiqaptapuni niyta munan.
One by one, one by one.	Hukmanta hukmanta.
But we are happy.	Ichaqa kusisqam kanchik.
I don't care about that either.	Ñuqapas manam chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
That was obviously wrong.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu karqan.
Nothing was that simple.	Manam imapas chayna facilchu karqa.
I didn’t know that at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan chaytaqa yacharqanichu.

She would have preferred to be alone with him.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan paywan sapallan kayta.
I didn’t see anything.	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu.
Nobody wants to.	Manan pipas munanchu.
Perhaps, too difficult.	Ichapas, ancha sasa.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Two, three years ago.	Iskay, kimsa wata ñawpaq.
This would be great if you wanted to.	Kayqa ancha allinmi kanman munaspaqa.
He’s almost.	Payqa yaqa.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
That’s what it does.	Chaytan ruwan.
But, yeah, maybe.	Ichaqa, arí, ichapas.
You can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I'll keep doing it.	Hinallam ruwasaq.
That’s what it does.	Chaytan ruwan.
He realized that.	Payqa chayta repararqanmi.
It’s going to be good.	Allinmi kananmanta.
It will certainly be better.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan allin kanqa.

Hopefully he will do better.	Munaymanmi aswan allinta ruwananpaq.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
This should be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi kanan.
That made it better.	Chayqa aswan allintam ruwarqa.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
I thought you were a nice person.	Sumaq runa kasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
Maybe a lot of things.	Ichapas achka imakuna.
One night.	Huk tuta.
Then he will go.	Chaymantaqa rinqa.

Yes, you do.	Arí, qamqa ruwanki.
Here it is, right here.	Kaypi kachkan.
You can’t predict that.	Manan chaytaqa willayta atiwaqchu.
He seemed very, very happy.	Payqa ancha, ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
I’m sure it’s going to be great.	Seguro kani ancha hatun kananmanta.
He can't do it.	Payqa manam ruwayta atinmanchu.
Would it be here.	¿Kaypichu kanman.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
You know everything.	Tukuy imatam yachanki.
He told me not to do it.	Niwarqa ama ruwanaypaq.
He is now the man.	Payqa kunanmi chay runa.

It’s a very difficult thing to do.	Ancha sasa ruway.

In the city.	Llaqtapi.
Not like it is now.	Mana kunan hinachu.
I'm more certain about it.	Aswan segurom kani chaymanta.
A really good one.	Chiqap allin kaq.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
I'm really looking forward to that.	Chaytaqa anchatam suyachkani.
I meant nice.	Sumaqmi niyta munarqani.
He looked unhappy.	Payqa mana kusisqachu rikchakurqa.
He was very clear.	Payqa ancha sut’inmi karqan.
That’s the only thing.	Chayqa sapallanmi.
He was such a nice guy.	Payqa chayna sumaq runam karqa.
Not sure what to do about it.	Mana segurochu chaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
He had to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
He probably did just that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqa.
Indeed, he still is.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa kunankamapas kashan.
It’s very, very nice.	Ancha ancha sumaqmi.
You're not sure anymore.	Manañam segurochu kanki.
He can’t do it.	Payqa manan atinchu.
I’m not quite sure why.	Manam allintachu yachani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
You know very well that it is not.	Allintam yachanki mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He knows what is coming.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna hamunanta.
It was always like that.	Sapa kutim chayna karqa.
Nothing about me.	Mana imapas ñuqamanta.
I mean, it might be early, but .	Niyta munani, ichapas temprano kanman, ichaqa .
That did the job.	Chayqa chay llamkayta ruwarqa.
Once again two.	Huk kuti iskay.
It’s a good thing here.	Kaypiqa allinmi kachkan.
He wanted to know.	Payqa yachayta munarqa.
It would be like that.	Chayna kanman.
That's how fast.	Chay hina utqaylla.
I couldn’t really help anyone.	Manam chiqaptaqa pitapas yanapayta atirqanichu.
I’m better at it.	Aswan allinmi kani chaypi.
I can’t tell you.	Mana willayta atiymanchu.
It certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwan.
That meant it.	Chayqa niyta munarqa.
He doesn’t, really.	Payqa manan, cheqaqtachu.
Maybe it was there, after all.	Ichapas chaypi karqa, tukuy imamanta.
I almost certainly did.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqani.
It will be about two years.	Iskay wata hinam kanqa.
That’s not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanqa.
They’re injured.	Paykunaqa k’irisqa kanku.
He seemed very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
That’s not going to be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
Don’t really want to.	Ama chiqaptachu munanki.
Man, this was good.	Runa, kayqa allinmi karqa.
So, it would be great.	Chayna, ancha allin kanman.
But things are no longer right here.	Ichaqa manañan kaypiqa allinchu kashan.
He really doesn't.	Payqa chiqaptam mana.
But he refused to talk to her.	Ichaqa manan paywan rimayta munarqanchu.
Now it’s not.	Kunanqa manañam.
It means it was a good day.	Niyta munan allin punchaw kasqanmanta.
But it can’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
Now I want to know.	Kunanqa yachayta munani.
I would never do that now.	Kunanqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
Yes, but it’s not.	Arí, ichaqa manan.
Not bad but not all that good either.	Mana mana allinchu ichaqa mana tukuy chay allinchu nitaq.
I mean, never.	Niyta munani, mana hayk’aqpas.
But it is very good.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi.
I know that’s the case.	Chaytaqa yachanim.
I don’t know what to say.	Manam yachanichu ima niyta.
You are a human being.	Runa runam kanki.
I think you do it all the time.	Yuyaykuni tukuy tiempo chayta ruwanki.
Both are important.	Iskayninkum ancha allin.
Everything is not right.	Tukuy imapas manam allinchu.
The man was good.	Runa allinmi karqa.
He's very tired, very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk'usqa, ancha sayk'usqa.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
Maybe the second one.	Ichapas iskay kaq.
It was a beautiful, beautiful day.	Sumaq, sumaq punchawmi karqa.
This is not a bad thing.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu.
I know you are busy.	Yachanim ocupasqa kasqaykita.
Too many, one after another.	Ancha achka, hukmanta hukmanta.
But things were not going well.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan imapas.
That will be next week.	Chayqa hamuq semanan kanqa.
She is sad and lonely.	Payqa llakisqa, sapallanmi.
I’m here to stay.	Ñuqaqa kaypi kachkani.
He doesn’t know anything.	Payqa manan imatapas yachanchu.
But, maybe not always.	Ichaqa, ichapas mana sapa kutichu.
He didn’t know how to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta yacharqanchu.
He can’t afford the money.	Mana qullqita atinchu.
I can’t do that anymore.	Manañam chaytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu.
Hopefully it will be soon.	Munaymanmi chaylla kananta.
Alright? 	Allinmi?
. . . .	.
It was all day long.	Tukuy punchawmi karqa.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
Not much of a smile.	Mana anchatachu.
I didn't mean that, not really.	Manam chaytaqa niyta munarqanichu, manam chiqaptachu.
But that wouldn’t have been the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman karqan.
I was okay with it.	Allinmi karqani.
That has always been true.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chiqap karqa.
Maybe you’ll get hurt.	Ichapas k’irisqa kanki.
This went on for about a week, maybe two.	Kayqa yaqa huk semana hinam karqa, ichapas iskay semana.
Why are they.	¿Imanasqataq kanku.
I think that is wrong.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
But he refused to talk to me.	Ichaqa manan ñoqawan rimayta munarqanchu.
I am very much afraid of that.	Chaytaqa anchatam manchakuni.
I know that for sure.	Chaytaqa allintam yachani.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
I did everything wrong.	Tukuy imatam mana allinta ruwarqani.
He wasn’t happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu karqan.
I did the right thing.	Ñuqaqa allintam ruwarqani.
She knew he knew what she was thinking.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima yuyaykusqanmanta yachasqanmanta.
Very good guy.	Ancha allin runa.
He was indeed very happy.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ancha kusisqa kasharqan.
He’ll be the one.	Payqa kanqa.
Today was that day.	Kunan punchawmi chay punchaw karqa.
It was said yes.	Arí nisqa karqan.
Everything was wonderful.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi karqa.

I didn’t want to believe that.	Chaytaqa manam creeyta munarqanichu.
I was indeed.	Cheqaqtapunin karqani.
But if he is.	Ichaqa sichus payqa kanman chayqa.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I was sure tomorrow would be better.	Seguro karqani paqarin aswan allin kananta.
Nothing was certain.	Manam imapas segurochu karqa.
She was beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa.
But this is obvious.	Ichaqa kayqa sut’inmi.
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
I can’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atinichu.
It didn't look very good.	Manam ancha allinchu rikchakurqa.
This is very clearly not the case.	Kayqa ancha sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
Maybe he did it very badly.	Ichapas ancha mana allinta ruwarqa.
I never knew it would fail.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu mana allinta ruwananpaqqa.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
Not sure what he means.	Mana segurochu ima niyta munasqanmanta.
. . . .	.
You were the one.	Qamqa karqanki.
It wouldn’t be good at all.	Manan imapipas allinchu kanman.
It's pretty obvious.	Allin sut'inmi.
But he still wanted to play.	Ichaqa hinallam pukllayta munarqa.
You really have to do something.	Cheqaqtapunin imatapas ruwanayki.
Could that really be the case.	¿Cheqaqtachu chayna kanman.
He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi karqa.
This couldn't be better.	Kayqa manam aswan allinchu kanman.
Of course, it wasn't that easy.	Arí, manam chayna facilchu karqa.
Yes, it is very good.	Arí, ancha allinmi.
That is as it should be.	Chayqa imayna kanan hinam.
I think it's just that.	Chaylla kasqanmantam piensani.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
I don't think he will.	Manam piensanichu chaynata ruwananta.
But now it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan imananpaschu.
But he doesn’t want to.	Ichaqa manan munanchu.
Not like before.	Mana ñawpaq hinachu.
It’s certainly not good enough.	Cheqaqtapunin mana allinchu.
If you want to be happy, you will be happy.	Kusisqa kayta munaspaqa, kusisqam kanki.
It was better than beautiful.	Sumaq kasqanmantaqa aswan allinmi karqa.
It is still doing well.	Hinallam allinta ruwachkan.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But this cannot do it.	Ichaqa manan kayqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
No.	Manam.
You are here today.	Kunanmi kaypi kachkanki.
I always wonder.	Sapa kutim tapukuni.
That’s a very bad thing.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi.
Perhaps he will have to do it now.	Yaqapaschá kunanqa ruwanan kanqa.
No one knew where he was.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
Okay, that’s great.	Allinmi, chayqa ancha allinmi.
He took the initiative.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi imatapas ruwarqan.
Are you sure?.	¿Segurochu kanki?.
It’s not good enough now.	Kunanqa mana allinchu.
He obviously doesn't want that.	Sut'inmi mana munanchu chayta.
There is no tomorrow.	Manam paqarin kanchu.
I just don’t know what to say.	Chaylla mana yachanichu ima niyta.
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
The process was a great one.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqan.
That lasted about a week.	Chayqa huk semana hinam karqa.
Everything looks nice.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi rikchakun.
Other than that, this does.	Huk chaymanta, kay ruwan.
However, he is happy now.	Ichaqa, kunanqa kusisqam kachkan.
I guess something is wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman nispaymi suyachkani.
What? 	Ima?
You don't know what they are here.	Kaypiqa manam yachankichu imakuna kasqankuta.
I am quite happy about that.	Chaymantaqa allintam kusisqa kachkani.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
If you want to be someone, do something.	Pipas kayta munaspaqa imatapas ruway.
Maybe he doesn’t.	Ichapas payqa mana.
But in this day and age.	Ichaqa kay tiempopiqa.
He will be like a good guy.	Allin ruwaq hinam kanqa.
Yes, very much so.	Arí, anchata.
Sure he did that.	Seguro chayta ruwarqan.
That’s never going to work.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanqa.
That's still pretty great, though.	Chayqa hinallam ancha hatun, ichaqa.
Never mind that.	Ama hayk’aqpas chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
At the time, he was angry that this was the case.	Chay tiempopiqa phiñasqa kasharqan chhayna kasqanmanta.
He was always there.	Payqa sapa kutim karqa.
It could be better but it doesn’t seem right.	Aswan allinmi kanman ichaqa manan allinchu rikch’akun.
But it was a bit awkward.	Ichaqa huk chhikantan mana allinchu karqan.
That’s what you need to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki.
He was too good to be true.	Payqa llumpay allinmi karqa.
He will certainly do it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwanqa.
Can you do it.	¿Atiwaqchu.
Someone had to be better than that.	Pipas chaymanta aswan allin kanan karqa.
But it’s okay if you don’t want to.	Ichaqa mana munaspaqa allinmi.
Not always.	Mana sapa kutichu.
There were three.	Kimsa kasqa.
Maybe he is, maybe he isn't.	Ichapas payqa kachkan, manapaschá.
But it’s not easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu.
Maybe not so much.	Ichapas mana anchatachu.
He doesn’t know like any other.	Payqa manan huk hinachu yachan.
I don't know this for sure.	Kaytaqa manam allintachu yachani.
Hopefully, it will be nice.	Munaymanmi, sumaqmi kanqa.
Very very, I'm really sorry.	Ancha ancha, chiqaptam llakikuni.
Still maybe.	Hinallam ichapas.
But you can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atiwaqchu.
It was probably that good.	Yaqapaschá chayna allin karqa.
Not to anyone.	Mana pimanpas.
Probably the second one.	Yaqapaschá iskay kaq.
Probably not.	Manapaschá.
It’s a very good one.	Ancha allinmi.
But I want to say this.	Ichaqa kayta niyta munani.
You don’t know what they are like.	Manan yachankichu imayna kasqankuta.
Art.	Sumaq ruway.
That was some of the best.	Chayqa wakin aswan allinmi karqa.
He was such a man.	Payqa chayna runam karqa.
I’m still exhausted.	Hinallam sayk’usqa kachkani.
It was always busy.	Sapa kutim ocupasqa karqa.
He never knows anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas imatapas yachanchu.
But then you knew that, of course.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa chaytan yacharqanki, sut’inmi.
She knew he knew it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta yachasqanmanta.
He had to do something today.	Kunan punchawmi imatapas ruwanan karqa.
Three, two, one.	Kimsa, iskay, huk.
If that’s all there is to it.	Sichus chaylla kanman chayqa.
Now now that.	Kunanqa kunan chayta.
But no one can help him.	Ichaqa manan pipas yanapayta atinmanchu.
That’s it, nothing.	Chayqa, mana imapas.
He knows he’s doing the right thing.	Payqa yachanmi allin ruwasqanmanta.
I wasn’t sure at all.	Manam imapipas segurochu karqani.
He doesn’t want to go there.	Mana chayman riyta munanchu.
He does it well.	Payqa allintam chaytaqa ruwan.
I said it was right.	Allintam nirqani.
If it is, of course.	Sichus kashan chayqa, cheqaqtapunin.
You never really know.	Manam haykapipas chiqaptaqa yachankichu.

He had no idea how he was going to do it.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imayna ruwananta.
I don’t know where it is.	Manam yachanichu maypi kasqanmanta.
That was the only thing that happened.	Chayqa hinallam karqa.
I’m waiting for something to happen.	Suyachkani imapas pasananta.
I couldn’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atirqanichu.
He wasn’t happy about it.	Payqa manan chaymanta kusisqachu kasharqan.
I mean, maybe.	Niyta munani, ichapas.
He seemed fine now.	Payqa kunanqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
This is indeed the case.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa chhayna.
What a beautiful experience that was.	Ima sumaqmi chayqa karqa.
I wanted to play it.	Chayta pukllayta munarqani.
He was tired and angry.	Payqa sayk’usqa, phiñasqa ima kasqa.
He said everything about me was so great.	Payqa nirqam tukuy ima ñuqamanta ancha hatun kasqanmanta.
Here’s everything.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas kachkan.
I really hope he does.	Chiqaptam suyachkani chayta ruwananta.
That is a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
He had to do something.	Imatapas ruwanan karqan.
Very likely he did.	Ancha yaqapaschá chaynata ruwarqa.
You want to be consistent.	Chayman hina kayta munanki.
I’m glad about it.	Kusikuni chaymanta.
He didn’t want this.	Payqa manan kayta munarqanchu.
First of all, it’s the name.	Ñawpaqtaqa, sutinmi.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Kaypiqa manam imapas mana allinchu.
I certainly did that.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqani.
He wants to talk about me.	Payqa ñuqamanta rimayta munan.
In fact, they’re both great.	Chiqaptaqa, iskayninkum ancha allin.
You're going to be injured.	K'irisqa kanki.
But if you want to.	Ichaqa munaspaqa.
That would be a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi kanman.
The immediacy was important.	Chaylla ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I'm really looking forward to that.	Chaytaqa anchatam suyachkani.
He might do something.	Yaqapaschá imatapas ruwanman.
Like everything else.	Tukuy imapas hina.
Almost too much.	Yaqa llumpay.
I knew it before.	Ñawpaqtaqa yacharqanim.
But now there is no time.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan tiempo kanchu.
What’s the matter with it.	Imataq chaymanta.
Like, a lot of it.	Imayna, achka chaymanta.
But no, it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan, manan chay hina facilchu.
I'm probably the one.	Yaqapaschá chayna kani.
She knew what he meant.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima niyta munasqanmanta.
He thought maybe he could.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi ichapas chayta ruwayta atinman nispa.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
Three days at most.	Kimsa punchaw aswan achka.
That this man could believe that, about me.	Chayta kay runa creeyta atisqanmanta, ñuqamanta.
The only one, in fact.	Chay sapallan, chiqaptaqa.
I'm not sure there is one.	Manam segurochu kani huk kasqanmanta.
Then he seemed almost happy.	Chaymantaqa yaqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
That day is today.	Chay punchawqa kunan punchawmi.
It was indeed the case.	Chiqaptam chayna karqa.
. . . .	.
Maybe one day it will.	Ichapas huk punchaw chayna kanman.
Every day here is like the day before.	Kaypiqa sapa punchawmi ñawpaq punchaw hina.
This wasn’t always the case.	Kayqa manan sapa kuti hinachu karqan.
It was safer.	Aswan segurom karqa.
First of all, it’s time.	Ñawpaqtaqa tiempon.
But he was worried.	Ichaqa llakisqa kasharqan.
I guess I thought so.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa piensarqani.
Of course, that’s the first thing you learn.	Arí, chaytan ñawpaqtaqa yachanki.
It wasn’t always that way.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna karqa.
Not nearly as good.	Mana yaqa allinchu.
I think it was there.	Chaypi kasqanmantam piensani.
Indeed, he did.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
They are a	Paykunaqa huk .
This morning, early, first thing.	Kunan paqarin, temprano, ñawpaq kaq.
He didn’t want to say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas niyta munarqanchu.
He was there for the guy.	Payqa chaypi kasqa.
It is not yet	Manaraqmi .
They’re new here.	Paykunaqa kaypi musuq kanku.
That’s not going to work though.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa ichaqa.
I can’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atiymanchu.
About every three weeks.	Yaqa sapa kimsa semana.
Good as new.	Musuq hina allin.
It would be the only thing.	Chaylla kanman.
This, however, is a good thing.	Kayqa ichaqa allinmi.
She’s much nicer now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan sumaqmi.
It’s all good though.	Tukuy allinmi ichaqa.
I know, that's it.	Yachanim, chayta.
Both are safe.	Iskayninkum seguro kachkanku.

That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
He never wanted to know.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yachayta munarqanchu.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
Maybe it would have been.	Ichapas chayna kanman karqa.
He probably did it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I don’t know how to describe it.	Manan yachanichu imaynatachus willayta.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu.
This is really interesting.	Kayqa chiqap sumaqmi.
He shouldn't be here.	Payqa manam kaypichu kanan.
Man, all very human.	Runa, tukuy ancha runa.
Maybe it’s almost likely.	Ichapas yaqapaschá kanman.
You’re going to do that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwanki.
She was really nice.	Payqa chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
However, this approach is not very effective.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa mana ancha allinchu.
This is the one here.	Kay kaypi kaq.
But if you do, you do.	Ichaqa chayta ruwanki chayqa, ruwanki.
That is once every year.	Chayqa sapa wata huk kutim.
Anything could be better.	Imapas aswan allinmi kanman.
I’m not happy about it.	Manam chaymantaqa kusisqachu kani.
I'm fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kachkani.
It won’t be that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu kanqa.
This should be good!.	¡Kayqa allinmi kanan!.
I wonder what his name is.	Ima sutinmi nispa tapukuni.
I suspect it did.	Sospechani chay ruwasqanmanta.
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.
He is very happy to be here.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan kaypi kasqanmanta.
You knew that very well.	Chaytaqa allintam yacharqanki.
It looked uncertain.	Mana segurochu rikchakurqa.
Which looks nicer.	Imataq aswan sumaq rikch’akun.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
They are that good.	Paykunaqa chayna allinmi kanku.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
But he can’t.	Ichaqa manan atinchu.
She looks very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
I'm not sure if it's too much.	Manam segurochu kani sichus ancha achka kasqanmanta.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
Really, anything though.	Chiqaptaqa, imapas ichaqa.
What do you want from me?.	¿Imatataq ñuqamanta munanki?.
I've never seen that before.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
That doesn’t matter.	Chayqa manan imananpaschu.
If anything happens.	Sichus imapas kanman chayqa.
But very quickly.	Ichaqa ancha utqaylla.
This can be very useful.	Kayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
It’s not, it’s not.	Manam mana.
Great day, tomorrow.	Hatun punchaw, paqarin.
But I did it right.	Ichaqa chaytaqa allintan ruwarqani.
I knew he would.	Yacharqanim chayta ruwananta.
That’s obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi.
I can’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atiymanchu.
He wasn't sure he would.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan chayta ruwananmanta.
Perhaps that was the case.	Yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
I thought that was great.	Chayqa ancha allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Beautiful thing.	Sumaq kaq.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
That’s something interesting.	Chayqa imapas sumaqmi.
I would love to know that.	Chayta yachayta anchata munani.
Do it again if you want.	Munaspaqa hukmanta ruway.
Make it so'.	Chayna kananpaq ruway'.
He was really human.	Payqa chiqaptam runa karqa.
He was right, it was great.	Payqa allintam nirqa, ancha allinmi karqa.
I wonder about that.	Chayta tapukuni.
It was a beautiful day.	Chay punchawqa sumaqmi karqa.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan chayqa.
But he never could.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas atirqanchu.
It’s not there anymore.	Manañam kanchu.
I didn’t see it.	Manam rikurqanichu.
If that’s what you want.	Sichus chayta munanki chayqa.
He was very tough.	Payqa ancha sinchitan karqan.
That’s what he could do.	Chaytan payqa ruwayta atinman karqan.
I hope all is well.	Suyachkani tukuy imapas allin kananpaq.
But he would not be able to speak.	Ichaqa manan rimayta atinmanchu karqan.
He was sure of it now.	Payqa kunanmi chaymanta seguro kasqa.
It would be wrong not to do so.	Mana chayta ruwayqa mana allinchu kanman.
I wouldn't do it again.	Manañam hukmanta ruwaymanchu karqa.
You certainly do.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanki.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
Now I did it.	Kunanqa ruwarqani.
He would be better.	Payqa aswan allinmi kanman.
I think he is.	Payqa chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
But I'm sure it's wrong.	Ichaqa segurom kani mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
I'm not so sure anymore.	Manañam chayna segurochu kani.
He was like that.	Payqa chayna hinam karqa.
That’s the time.	Chay tiempon.
Here is a first step.	Kaypi huk ñawpaq kaq ruway kachkan.
But he was such a great man.	Ichaqa chhayna hatun runan karqan.
Yes, it was a good one.	Arí, allinmi karqa.
He knew that.	Chaytaqa yacharqanmi.
Obviously I wanted to be there.	Sut’inmi chaypi kayta munarqani.
I was never good enough.	Manam haykapipas allinchu karqani.
He’s really good.	Payqa chiqap allinmi.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
But it won’t be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanqa.
It wouldn’t be right.	Manam allinchu kanman.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
Hopefully it was good.	Munaymanmi allin kasqanmanta.
Like, really new.	Imayna, chiqap musuq.
Here, or here.	Kaypi, icha kaypi.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
But nothing is wrong.	Ichaqa manan imapas mana allinchu.
Nothing was right.	Manam imapas allinchu karqa.
I am an everyday person.	Sapa punchaw runam kani.
It means a lot.	Achkatam niyta munan.
This was a wonderful experience.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Yes, he knows where he is.	Arí, maypi kasqanmantam yachan.
He was a great guy.	Hatun runam karqa.
Now that was a good guy.	Kunanqa chayqa allin runan kasqa.
It's safer, for you.	Aswan segurom, qampaq.
That wasn’t always the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
It’s really, really nice.	Chiqap, chiqap sumaqmi.
I was busy, but busy in a good way.	Ocupasqa karqani, ichaqa allintam ocupasqa karqani.
I know they are there.	Yachanim chaypi kasqankuta.
Man, what a day.	Runa, ima punchaw.
About being alone.	Sapallan kaymanta.
It wouldn’t be a bad thing.	Mana mana allinchu kanman.
It’s not good in every way.	Tukuy imapipas mana allinchu.
I was okay with it.	Allinmi karqani.
He knew where he was.	Payqa yacharqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta.
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
I almost wanted to go.	Yaqapaschá riyta munarqani.
It should be faster.	Aswan utqaylla kanan tiyan.
That’s not going to be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
Otherwise, try this step.	Mana chayqa, kay ruwayta ruway.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
It wasn’t quite there yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu karqa.
He should have been very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kanan karqa.
That’s what he told me.	Chaytan payqa willarqan.
Who really knows.	Pitaq chiqaptapuni yachan.
But here it is not.	Ichaqa kaypiqa manan.
Faster than me, even.	Aswan utqaylla ñuqamanta, astawan.
I don’t really want to.	Manam anchatachu munani.
No one could ever know.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas yachayta atinmanchu karqan.
You know everything.	Tukuy imatam yachanki.
Now forgive me.	Kunanqa pampachaykuway.
Yes, it is very good.	Arí, ancha allinmi.
But this is not easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kayqa.

But it won’t be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanqa.
I didn’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu.
He doesn’t though.	Payqa manan ichaqa.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
It was always there.	Sapa kutim karqa.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
Everything is not very good.	Tukuy imapas manam ancha allinchu.
That’s what it says.	Chaytan nin.
This is the best.	Kayqa aswan allinmi.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan.
This means that.	Kayqa niyta munan.
I know something is very wrong.	Yachanim imapas ancha mana allin kasqanmanta.
This is good for you.	Kayqa allinmi qampaq.
That seems to be the case.	Chayqa kanman hinam.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allinchu.
All right, now.	Allinmi, kunanqa.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He seemed a little more worried, now.	Payqa aswan pisi llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa, kunanqa.
Now then.	Kunan chaymanta.
He knew they were both tired.	Payqa yacharqanmi iskayninku sayk’usqa kasqankuta.
No, it’s not a bad thing.	Manan, manan mana allinchu.
It still looked great.	Hinallam ancha sumaq rikchakurqa.
That was supposed to be.	Chayqa kanan karqan.
No one wanted to talk to him.	Manan pipas paywan rimayta munarqanchu.
But it won’t be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanqa.
That was yesterday.	Chayqa qayna punchawmi karqa.
He really wanted to be.	Payqa anchatan kayta munarqan.
That's not too bad.	Chayqa manam ancha mana allinchu.
Obviously something is wrong.	Sut’inmi imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
Is it really?.	¿Cheqaqtachu?.
I know all about it.	Tukuy chaymanta yachani.
I want it so much.	Anchatam munani.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
That’s going to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanqa.
It was actually quite interesting.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I'm there all day.	Tukuy punchawmi chaypi kachkani.
It is .	Kayqa .
I have been there many times.	Achka kutim chaypi karqani.
I hope this is not true.	Suyachkani kayqa mana chiqap kananpaq.
He is a human being.	Payqa huk runam.
I’m probably here now.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá kaypi kachkani.
I'll do it for you.	Qampaq ruwasaq.
I didn’t think of that.	Manam chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu.
He is with us now.	Payqa kunanmi ñuqaykuwan kachkan.
Now I am ready to do that.	Kunanqa chayta ruwanaypaqmi kachkani.
There is a greater good in it.	Aswan hatun allinmi chaypi kachkan.
Not sure what it is.	Mana segurochu imakuna kasqanmanta.
It says what it is.	Ima kasqanmantam nin.
He wasn't sure anyone did.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan pipas chayta ruwasqanmanta.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
But now it was.	Ichaqa kunanmi chayna karqa.
But everything will be fine.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
He had to do that today.	Chaytaqa kunan punchawmi ruwanan karqa.
You can’t buy anything.	Manam imatapas rantiyta atiwaqchu.
If you know what you want now, that’s great.	Kunan munasqaykita yachanki chayqa, ancha allinmi.

There is nothing here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas kanchu.
All day, every day.	Tukuy punchaw, sapa punchaw.
I couldn’t get over it.	Manam chaytaqa atipayta atirqanichu.
He’s not alone.	Manan sapallanchu.
It wasn’t like it used to be.	Manan ñawpaq hinachu karqan.
I don’t want to have to do that.	Manam munanichu chayta ruwanay kasqanmantaqa.
Everything will be fine.	Lliwmi allin kanqa.
He is alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kachkan.
It was obvious.	Sut’inmi karqan.
A beautiful day.	Huk sumaq punchaw.
Everything seemed fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa.
There was always something.	Sapa kutim imapas karqa.
I think it might be good for you.	Yuyaykuni, qampaq allin kanman.
He really wanted to believe it.	Payqa anchatan munarqan chayta creeyta.
I don’t have it either.	Manam ñuqapas kanchu.
He knew he had to do something.	Payqa yacharqanmi imatapas ruwananta.
I’ll be there tomorrow.	Paqarinmi chaypi kasaq.
He doesn’t exist.	Payqa manan kanchu.
It will be very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi kanqa.
It sure looks like it though.	Seguro rikchakun chayman hina ichaqa.
I don’t want to do it either.	Manam ñuqapas ruwayta munanichu.
But it was worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi karqan.
He never knew what happened.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu imachus pasasqanmanta.
I don’t want to talk.	Manam rimayta munanichu.
Do something to improve your performance.	Imatapas ruway aswan allinta ruwanaykipaq.
I didn’t see anyone.	Mana pitapas rikurqanichu.
I can’t do that now.	Chaytaqa manam kunanqa ruwaymanchu.
It was great to have him all that time.	Ancha allinmi karqa chay tukuy tiempo paywan kayqa.
I've been here all week.	Tukuy semana kaypi kachkani.
It’s actually worse.	Chiqaptaqa aswan mana allinmi.
He certainly said that.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa nirqan.
Now I don't know what to say.	Kunanqa manam yachanichu ima niyta.
No one knows anything.	Manan pipas imatapas yachanchu.
But maybe you know? 	Ichaqa, ¿yaqapaschá yachanki?
. . . .	.
You’re a human being.	Qamqa runam kanki.
Why, of course it is.	Imarayku, sut’inmi chayna.
That’s a good, good thing.	Chayqa allinmi, allinmi.
He knew he would act accordingly.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayman hina ruwananta.
More on that, please.	Astawan chaymanta, ama hina kaspa.
That was obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi karqan.
He certainly wasn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu karqan.
Tell me what the date is.	Willay ima punchawmi.
That would be nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman.
Maybe it was something else.	Ichapas huk imapas karqa.
It’s a very good one.	Ancha allinmi.
But we’re not sure anymore.	Ichaqa manañan segurochu kayku.
He thought that was all.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chaylla kasqanmanta.
I don’t want to be like that.	Manam munanichu chayna kayta.
Perhaps that was the case.	Yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
However, I think it is true.	Ichaqa, chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
She looks very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
It shouldn’t be that way.	Manan chay hinachu kanan.
Either that, or he wanted to know.	Icha chayta, icha payqa yachayta munarqa.
I wonder if he’s scared.	Tapukunitaqmi mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
This was a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi karqa.
I think that's a good thing.	Chayqa allin kasqanmantam piensani.
I doubt that’s all.	Iskayrayani chaylla kasqanmanta.
But no one knows for sure.	Ichaqa manan pipas allintachu yachan.
I’d probably be the first one.	Yaqapaschá ñawpaq kaq kayman.
. . . .	.
More than one, actually.	Aswan hukmanta, chiqaptaqa.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
More than one thing, in every way.	Hukmanta aswan imapas, tukuy imapipas.
He didn’t always do that.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwaq.
That doesn’t matter.	Chayqa manan imananpaschu.
But he was scared.	Ichaqa mancharisqa.
Here, in the city.	Kaypi, llaqtapi.
He couldn’t say no.	Payqa manan niyta atirqanchu.
But it won’t be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanqa.
Yesterday was the second time.	Qayna punchawmi iskay kaq kuti karqa.
This is not a bad thing.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu.
She really wanted to be with him.	Payqa anchatan munarqan paywan kayta.
Not sure about that.	Mana chaymanta segurochu.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I like it a lot.	Anchatam gustan.
Will do it again for sure.	Hukmanta ruwanqa seguro.
I'll do it today.	Kunanmi ruwasaq.
I did that very well.	Chaytaqa ancha allintam ruwarqani.
He is more of a morning person.	Payqa aswan paqarin runam.
He was pretty sure it was.	Payqa allintam seguro karqa chayna kasqanmanta.
This is a little good.	Kayqa huk chikan allinmi.
I hope you are well.	Suyachkani allin kasqaykita.
That’s what I’m going to do.	Chaytan ruwasaq nispa.
Not sure how it happened.	Mana segurochu imayna pasasqanmanta.
I want to know what they are like.	Imayna kasqankuta yachayta munani.
This can be very difficult.	Kayqa ancha sasa kanman.
A really great guy.	Chiqap hatun runa.
Obviously, it’s too late.	Sut’inmi, ancha tarde.
Fast, very fast.	Utqaylla, ancha utqaylla.
Was that always the case? 	¿Sapa kutichu chhayna karqan?
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
He seemed nervous.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam karqa.
I'm always really tired.	Sapa kutim chiqap sayk'usqa kani.
Yes, it’s a good one.	Arí, allinmi.
Everyone is there.	Lliwmi chaypi kachkanku.
He now really knows what he wants.	Payqa kunanqa cheqaqtapunin yachan ima munasqanmanta.
But it’s really hard to do.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sasa ruwayqa.
He should be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanan.
He wasn't sure why he was there.	Payqa manan segurochu kasharqan imarayku chaypi kasqanmanta.
I couldn’t tell.	Manam yachayta atirqanichu.
You never know what might happen.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu imakuna pasananta.
The process was a success.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqan.
That’s what he does.	Chaytan payqa ruwan.
He is not that good.	Payqa manam chayna allinchu.
It went very well.	Ancha allintam rirqa.
Else, .	Mana chayqa, .
They are very good.	Paykunaqa ancha allinmi kanku.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
Everyone is everything.	Tukuy runa tukuy ima.
First, he was a human being.	Ñawpaqtaqa runam karqa.
It didn’t do much of anything.	Manam anchatachu imatapas ruwarqa.
He was like that.	Payqa hinam karqa.
But, as always.	Ichaqa, sapa kuti hina.
He is doing everything on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi tukuy imata ruwachkan.
It’s just not good enough.	Chaylla mana allinchu.
No one wants to know.	Manam pipas yachayta munanchu.
As now, he will be human.	Kunan hina, payqa runa kanqa.
I know better, you know .	Aswan allinta yachani, yachanki .
I couldn’t say that anymore.	Manañan chayta niyta atirqanichu.
I know he didn't.	Yachanim mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
I wonder about this.	Kaymanta tapukuni.
But of course that wasn’t the case.	Ichaqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu karqan.
You know exactly where it is.	Qamqa allintam yachanki maypi kasqanmanta.
I don’t know exactly.	Manam allintachu yachani.
Maybe you know it.	Ichapas yachanki.
However, this is not a very effective approach.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa ancha allinchu.
It was the most wonderful day!.	¡Aswan sumaq punchawmi karqa!.
A real person.	Chiqap runa.
I couldn’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanichu.
I know where that is.	Yachanim maypi chay kasqanmanta.
It wouldn’t be a good thing.	Mana allinchu kanman.
But I’m not sure he did.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kani chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Everything about this is beautiful.	Kaymanta tukuy imapas sumaqmi.
He is not sure.	Payqa manan segurochu kashan.
I didn’t want him to win.	Manam munarqanichu atipananta.
I know how to swim.	Nadayta yachani.
Tom couldn't believe it.	Tomqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
That’s not good you know.	Chayqa manan allinchu yachanki.
Then there’s the.	Chaymanta chaypi.
I was never sure.	Manam haykapipas segurochu karqani.
But he couldn’t tell.	Ichaqa manan yachayta atirqanchu.
But if you can’t talk about it, you can’t.	Ichaqa manan chaymanta rimayta atiwaqchu chayqa, manan atiwaqchu.
This is the best way.	Kaytaqa aswan allinmi.
This may not be so simple.	Kayqa manapaschá chayna facilchu kanman.
I never thought he would.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna ruwananta.
He was a pipeline.	Payqa pipas kasqa.
As always, .	Sapa kuti hina, .
He is a real person.	Payqa chiqap runam.

Everything is nice though.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi ichaqa.

Do what you want, what you want.	Munasqaykita, munasqaykita ruway.
That seems to be the case.	Chayqa kanman hinam.
But you wouldn’t want to.	Ichaqa manan munawaqchu.

You can’t beat it.	Mana atipayta atiwaqchu.

He probably doesn’t.	Payqa manapaschá.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
He looked at her carefully.	Payqa allintan qhawarirqan.

Almost no one knows why anymore.	Yaqapaschá manaña pipas yachanchu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
He doesn’t know any better.	Payqa manan aswan allintachu yachan.

That’s what he didn’t want.	Chaytan payqa mana munarqanchu.
No, he doesn’t care.	Manan, payqa manan imananpaschu.

Other than that, he was fine.	Mana chaymantaqa, payqa allinmi karqa.

Being that way.	Chayna kaspa.
Indeed, he did.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
He couldn’t get over it.	Payqa manan chaytaqa atipayta atirqanchu.

He can't help it.	Mana yanapayta atinchu.
He said something about it being a bad day.	Payqa imatapas nirqam mana allin punchaw kasqanmanta.

No one can tell the truth.	Manan pipas cheqaqtachu rimayta atinman.
He knows you’re not up to it.	Payqa yachanmi mana chayman hinachu kasqaykita.
Faster and faster.	Aswan utqaylla aswan utqaylla.

He wanted to do some solo work.	Payqa wakin sapallan llamk’ayta ruwayta munarqan.

I'm going to go, he said.	Risaq, nispa.
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.

It’s better than one.	Hukmanta aswan allinmi.
He told her not to do anything.	Imapas mana ruwananpaqmi nisqa.
Which is a bad guy.	Imataq mana allin ruwaq.
That looked really interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
But the name is good.	Ichaqa sutinmi allin.

He is doing a good job.	Payqa allintam ruwachkan.

But no, it had to be better than that.	Ichaqa manan, chaymanta aswan allin kanan karqan.

He was happy to have someone.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan pipas kasqanmanta.
He acted quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwarqan.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.

In fact, there is no one.	Chiqaptaqa manam pipas kanchu.
But, then, it was always there.	Ichaqa, chaymantaqa, ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
He seemed worried about what to do next.	Payqa llakisqa hinam karqa ima ruwananmanta.
You don’t want it right.	Mana allintachu munanki.

There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.

That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I wasn’t happy at all.	Manam imapipas kusisqachu karqani.
Nothing will ever quite do that.	Manam imapas haykapipas chaytaqa allintachu ruwanqa.

Never, ever.	Mana hayk’aqpas, hayk’aqpas.

Now it’s worse.	Kunanqa aswan mana allinmi.
He was very clearly alone.	Payqa ancha sut’inmi sapallan kasharqan.
That’s not going to work.	Chayqa manan allintachu ruwanqa.
He wants to know something.	Payqa imatapas yachayta munan.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
He knows exactly what he means.	Payqa allintan yachan ima niyta munasqanmanta.
He wants to believe that’s all there is to it.	Chaylla kasqanpi creeyta munan.
No one knows where.	Manan pipas yachanchu maypi.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.

He is busy today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi ocupasqa kachkan.
But, but, but.	Ichaqa, ichaqa, ichaqa.
He said it was okay.	Payqa allinmi nisqa.
He wasn't so sure.	Payqa manam chayna segurochu karqa.
Make that the first step.	Chayta ñawpaq kaq ruway.

Alright.	Allinmi.

And he was angry about it.	Hinan chaymanta phiñasqa kasharqan.

I can’t get over it.	Manam chaymantaqa atipayta atiymanchu.

He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manan allintachu chaytaqa ruwarqan.

It’s bigger than that.	Chaymanta aswan hatun.
That was always the case.	Chayqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
But there was nothing he could do.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
I'm sure no one is.	Seguro kani mana pipas kasqanmanta.

I can’t share this information with anyone.	Kay willayta mana pimanpas willayta atiymanchu.

However, this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
I don’t like him.	Payqa manan gustawanchu.
That wasn’t certain.	Chayqa manan segurochu karqan.
It was a long time ago.	Unayñan karqan.

No, not really .	Manan, manan cheqaqtachu .

Now,  .	Kunan, .
I really didn’t want to.	Chiqaptaqa manam munarqanichu.
However, it wasn’t a good one.	Ichaqa, manan allinchu karqan.
That always made everything worse.	Chayqa sapa kutim tukuy imata aswan mana allinta ruwaq.

That’s what it means.	Chayqa niyta munan.

All right, all right, all right.	Allinmi, allinmi, allinmi.

To be truthful.	Chiqap kananpaq.
If not, it’s fine.	Mana chayqa, allinmi.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kasqa.

Indeed, he was.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa karqan.
That’s what it says.	Chaytan nin.

He always seemed so alone.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna sapallan rikchakurqa.
But it wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman.
Too much of everything.	Llumpay tukuy ima.
He knew they were scared.	Payqa yacharqanmi mancharisqa kasqankuta.
That didn’t mean he couldn’t do it again.	Chayqa manan niyta munarqanchu manaña hukmanta ruwayta atisqanmanta.

It was a great experience, but a very difficult day.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa, ichaqa ancha sasa punchawmi karqa.
But it was still a bad day.	Ichaqa hinallam mana allin punchaw karqa.
I never wanted this.	Manam haykapipas kaytaqa munarqanichu.

Please do it now.	Ama hina kaspa kunan ruway.
And he was with her.	Hinan payqa paywan kasharqan.
He didn’t seem worried.	Payqa manan llakisqa hinachu karqan.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.

He doesn’t know why.	Payqa manan yachanchu imarayku.
Alright .	Allinmi .
He doesn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan munanchu chayta ruwayta.
Such a nice man, so to go.	Chayna sumaq runa, chayna rinanpaq.
But then it’s not good enough.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa mana allinchu.

You just have to keep doing it.	Qamqa hinallam ruwanayki.

But it won’t get any better.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu kanqa.
A few days, a week, maybe two.	Iskay kimsa punchaw, huk semana, ichapas iskay.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.

Maybe he’ll be here tonight.	Ichapas kunan tuta kaypi kanqa.
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
Why does it take so much time.	¿Imanasqataq chay ruwayqa ancha tiempota necesitan.
No one can believe it.	Manan pipas creeyta atinmanchu.
No, he’s not alone.	Manan, manan sapallanchu.
Not all that well.	Mana tukuy chay allintachu.
He looked at her sternly.	Payqa sinchitan qhawarirqan.

He couldn’t get over it.	Payqa manan chaytaqa atipayta atirqanchu.
It's not that bad here.	Kaypiqa manam chayna mana allinchu.

It's good, it's good, it's good.	Allinmi allinmi allin.
He looked fine, which was good.	Payqa allinmi rikchakurqa, chayqa allinmi karqa.
The process continues.	Chay ruwayqa hinallam kachkan.
He’s not here, though .	Payqa manan kaypichu kashan, ichaqa .

I’m not sure what to do.	Ñuqapas chayna kani.
Very nice, very nice.	Ancha sumaq, ancha sumaq.
I was okay with it.	Allinmi karqani.
He was nothing like that.	Payqa manan imapas chay hinachu karqan.
He didn’t want to buy anything.	Payqa manan imatapas rantiyta munarqanchu.
More every day.	Aswan sapa punchaw.
Like really angry.	Chiqap phiñasqa hina.
That’s the only thing.	Chayqa chaylla.
You may never know how many there are.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas yachankichu hayk’a kasqanmantaqa.
I think it should be good on its own.	Yuyaykuni sapallan allin kananta.
I don't know.	Manam yachanichu.
Clearly it’s not.	Sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
He probably didn't know that.	Payqa manapaschá chaytaqa yacharqanchu.
That can be difficult.	Chayqa sasa kanman.
This isn't the worst though.	Kayqa manam aswan mana allinchu ichaqa.
It was a good morning.	Allin paqarinmi karqa.

I don’t want to do this though.	Manam ichaqa kayta ruwayta munanichu.
However, this may not be a good idea.	Ichaqa, manapaschá allinchu kanman kayqa.
He had been there for a long time.	Unayñan chaypi kasharqan.
But no, he was alone.	Ichaqa manan, payqa sapallanmi kasharqan.
It doesn’t really mean that there is a future.	Manam chiqaptachu niyta munan hamuq tiempo kasqanmantaqa.
Good day.	Allin punchaw.

Maybe something new every week.	Ichapas sapa semana musuq imapas.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
Now it’s okay.	Kunanqa allinmi.
That’s not going to be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
This is good for you.	Kayqa allinmi qampaq.
He knows it now.	Payqa kunanmi yachan.
I really hope it never ever happens.	Chiqaptam suyachkani mana haykapipas haykapipas pasananta.

I’m not too sure yet.	Manaraqmi ancha segurochu kani.
But the coffee was good.	Ichaqa chay kukata allinmi kasqa.
Maybe it won’t work.	Ichapas mana allinchu kanqa.
But I couldn’t figure it out.	Ichaqa manan chayta yachayta atirqanichu.
We are not happy.	Manam kusisqachu kanchik.
No one could believe it, no one.	Manan pipas creeyta atirqanchu, manan pipas.

He had to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanan karqan.
That seemed to be the case.	Chayqa kanman hinam karqa.
I didn’t know that at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan chaytaqa yacharqanichu.
You know that very well.	Chaytaqa allintam yachanki.

That’s not what this is at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas kayqa.
It could still be worse.	Kunankamapas aswan mana allinmi kanman.

But now he is fine.	Ichaqa kunanqa allinmi kashan.
I know he doesn't really like it.	Yachanim mana anchatachu gustasqanmanta.
But it wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa mana allinchu kanman.
It wouldn’t be a good thing.	Mana allinchu kanman.
It wasn’t always that way.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna karqa.
Someone could have been very, very hurt.	Pipas ancha, ancha k’irisqa kanman karqan.

But it doesn’t work out.	Ichaqa manan allintachu ruwan.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Maybe you didn’t know.	Ichapas mana yacharqankichu.
That means someone is here.	Chayqa niyta munan pipas kaypi kasqanmanta.

That was great, that was good.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa, chayqa allinmi karqa.
He is nobody.	Payqa manan pipas kanchu.
He didn't really mean it.	Manam chiqaptachu chaynata niyta munarqa.

Really really really.	Chiqap chiqap chiqap.
He didn’t really want to talk.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu rimayta munarqan.
It’s the same thing.	Chayna hinam kachkan.
It had been a long time now.	Unayñan kunanqa karqan.

This is worse than anything.	Kayqa imamantapas aswan mana allinmi.
I wasn’t that good either.	Ñuqapas manam chayna allinchu karqani.

This is not what it used to be.	Kayqa manam ñawpaq hinachu.
I really wish he would do it more often.	Chiqaptam munani aswan sapa kuti chayta ruwananta.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
But now you know.	Kunanmi ichaqa yachanki.
I don’t want to be that real.	Manam chayna chiqap kayta munanichu.
Maybe now was the time.	Ichapas kunanqa chay tiempo karqa.
But it was good.	Ichaqa allinmi kasqa.
Obviously you should.	Sut’inmi chayta ruwanayki.
How beautiful it is.	Imayna sumaqmi.
Maybe you were a little angry.	Ichapas pisi phiñasqa karqanki.
He says this because he doesn’t want to.	Kaytaqa ninmi mana munasqanmanta.
This approach is wrong, and maybe that’s all.	Kay ruwayqa mana allinchu, ichapas chaylla.
Almost too good.	Yaqa ancha allin.
But, who knows.	Ichaqa, ¿pitaq yachan.
Once, twice, three times.	Huk kuti, iskay kuti, kimsa kuti.
But he did it right.	Ichaqa allintan ruwarqan.

He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
Yes that’s a good thing.	Arí chayqa allinmi.
He wants to be alone.	Sapallan kayta munan.
He was in a state of distress.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan.
Is that right?.	¿Allinchu chay?.
They are very nice now.	Kunanqa ancha sumaqmi kanku.
It’s not a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu.

He was injured.	Payqa k’irisqa kasqa.
However, it is not.	Ichaqa, manan chay hinachu.

But then he seemed very happy.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa ancha kusisqa hinam karqa.
But he must act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan.
It didn’t do very well.	Mana ancha allintachu ruwarqan.
He’s there for you.	Payqa chaypi kachkan.
But first, you really have to do it.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa cheqaqtapunin ruwanayki.

That was not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanan karqan.
He’s doing it right.	Payqa chayta ruwachkan.
He angrily refuses.	Payqa phiñasqa mana munanchu.

Okay, okay, whatever.	Allinmi, allinmi, imapas.

But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I was better off.	Aswan allinmi karqani.
I can’t tell you.	Manam willayta atiymanchu.

He still wasn't sure it was true.	Payqa hinallam mana segurochu karqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
He had a tough day yesterday.	Payqa qayna punchawmi sinchi punchaw karqa.
He did well, he did well.	Allintam ruwarqa, allintam ruwarqa.
You just can’t seem to help it.	Chaylla mana yanapayta atiwaqchu hina.

Maybe you are, maybe you’re not.	Ichapas kanki, ichapas mana.

Maybe never again.	Ichapas manaña haykapipas.
He knew why she was so happy.	Payqa yacharqanmi imarayku ancha kusisqa kashasqanmanta.
That wasn’t the right thing to do.	Chayqa manan allinchu kasharqan.
He seemed happy.	Payqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
Nothing will ever be right.	Manan imapas hayk’aqpas allinchu kanqa.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqan.
I cannot be like that here.	Kaypiqa manam chayna kayta atiymanchu.

Most certainly so.	Aswan seguro chay hina.
We are not good at everything.	Tukuy imatam mana allinchu kanchik.

But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
He did it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwarqa.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
That was thoroughly inappropriate.	Chayqa allintam mana allinchu karqa.

I want to work there.	Chaypi llamk'ayta munani.
That's great, actually.	Chayqa ancha allinmi, chiqaptaqa.

They are no longer good.	Manañam allinchu kanku.
It was a very bad experience.	Llumpay mana allinmi karqa.
I’m waiting for him to come.	Suyachkani hamunanta.
Okay, that’s a good thing.	Allinmi, chayqa allinmi.
But he kept saying it.	Ichaqa hinallam nirqa.
I don’t really know what this is.	Manam allintachu yachani ima kayqa kasqanmanta.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
He’s really thinking about it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaypi yuyaykushan.
You can be sure that is not the case now.	Chayqa kunan mana chayna kasqanmantam seguro kanki.

That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
That would have been better.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanman karqan.
They are both married.	Iskayninkum casarasqa kachkanku.
He wasn’t sure of anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas segurochu kasqa.
That meant a big man.	Chayqa hatun runa niyta munarqa.

Yeah, yeah, whatever.	Arí, arí, imapas.
That’s what you need to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki.
He would be fine if he were.	Payqa allinmi kanman chayqa.
He doesn’t always know.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu yachan.

To be no more.	Manaña kananpaq.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Payqa manam chaymanta rimayta munanchu.
I was pretty good, he was better.	Ñuqaqa allin allinmi karqani, payqa aswan allinmi karqa.
I don't think this will really do it.	Manam piensanichu kayqa chiqaptapuni ruwananta.
Obviously something happened.	Sut’inmi imapas pasasqanmanta.
But you probably know that.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa yachanki.
I know I’m going to go here.	Yachanim kayman riyta.
That wasn’t easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan.
I don’t want to go.	Manam riyta munanichu.
I didn’t think he would be that kind of person.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna runa kananta.
But it is very good.	Ichaqa ancha allinmi.
It looks good.	Allinmi rikchakun.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Perhaps he was.	Ichapas payqa karqa.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He wanted it so much.	Anchatam munarqa.
It does everything very quickly in a hurry.	Tukuy imatam ruwan ancha utqaylla utqaylla.
He was a happy man.	Payqa kusisqa runam karqa.
I wanted to talk about it.	Chayta rimayta munarqani.
I didn’t know it.	Manam yacharqanichu.
I think he wasn’t happy.	Yuyaykuni mana kusisqachu kasqanmanta.
Nothing else about it.	Mana imapas chaymantaqa.
But does he seem tired?.	Ichaqa, ¿sayk’usqa hinachu kashan?.
I really wish that wasn't the case.	Chiqaptam munani mana chayna kananta.
Yes, rather late.	Arí, aswan tarde.
But things are thoroughly wrong here.	Ichaqa kaypiqa allintan mana allinchu kashan.
He can’t believe what happened.	Payqa manan creeyta atinchu imachus pasasqanmanta.
He is not here.	Payqa manam kaypichu kachkan.
He never knew how to be alone.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yacharqanchu sapallan kayta.
But I doubt it.	Ichaqa iskayrayani.
Which is true for you.	Imataq chiqap qampaq.
He looks very good.	Payqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.
But I want to know why.	Ichaqa imarayku chayna kasqanmanta yachayta munani.
I don’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munanichu.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But then he refused.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan munarqanchu.
He was in deep distress.	Payqa sinchitan llakisqa kasharqan.
I wonder what it is.	Tapukuni imataq kasqanmanta.
It wasn't going to be that easy.	Manam chayna facilchu kanan karqa.
Do it accordingly.	Chayman hina ruway.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
. . . .	.
He is happy now.	Payqa kunanqa kusisqam kachkan.
But that is a good thing to do.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa allinmi.
Not sure how it could be better.	Mana segurochu imayna aswan allin kanman.
It’s not the first time, you know.	Manam ñawpaq kutichu, yachanki.
This looks very interesting.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.

I don’t know why, really.	Mana yachanichu imarayku, chiqaptapuni.
I know it’s going to happen.	Yachanim chayna kananta.
Otherwise, it’s too bad.	Mana chayqa, ancha mana allinmi.
He didn’t want anything to go wrong.	Payqa manan imapas mana allinchu kananta munarqan.
But maybe.	Ichaqa ichapas.
He knew he wanted to play.	Payqa yacharqanmi pukllayta munasqanmanta.
I didn’t know why.	Manam yacharqanichu imarayku.
He was there alone with her all day.	Payqa sapallanmi chaypi tukuy punchaw paywan karqa.
I wouldn’t do that to anyone.	Manam pitapas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
I am sure of that.	Chaymantaqa segurom kachkani.
There is no such thing now.	Kunanqa manam kanchu.
That looks pretty interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
Nobody likes that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas gustanchu.
That seemed unlikely.	Chayqa manapaschá hinachu karqan.
Many, many times.	Achka, achka kuti.
But he kept doing it.	Ichaqa hinallam ruwarqa.
It will be a very interesting year.	Ancha sumaq wata kanqa.

He was very lonely.	Payqa ancha sapallanmi kasqa.
Certainly not.	Cheqaqtapunin mana.
Lots of things, maybe.	Achka imakuna, ichapas.
He really had to do it.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwanan karqan.

That stuff isn’t right.	Chay imapas manam allinchu.
A few days, a week at the most.	Iskay kimsa punchaw, huk semana aswan achka.

It wasn’t a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu karqa.
It was never going to be that easy.	Manam haykapipas chayna facilchu kanan karqa.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He wanted it to be real.	Payqa munarqa chiqap kananta.
He loves to talk about it.	Payqa anchatam munan chaymanta rimayta.
He did much better.	Payqa aswan allintan ruwarqan.
He was very angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa kasharqan.
Great great great.	Hatun hatun hatun.
Maybe yes, maybe not.	Ichapas arí, ichapas mana.

I mean that’s a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi niyta munani.
Is that right?.	¿Allinchu chayna?.
I don't know .	Manam yachanichu .
That was a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
Now it’s not so good.	Kunanqa manaña ancha allinchu.
It wasn’t very good.	Manam ancha allinchu karqa.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
I’m almost happy.	Yaqa kusisqam kachkani.
It didn’t go well.	Manam allintachu rirqa.
He was really quick today.	Payqa chiqaptam kunan punchawqa utqaylla karqa.
Maybe tomorrow night.	Ichapas paqarin tuta.
He obviously wasn’t happy at all.	Payqa sut’inmi mana imapipas kusisqachu kasqa.
He doesn’t know what he wants.	Manam yachanchu ima munasqanmanta.
But everything is good and bad.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi mana allinchu.
One day is another day.	Huk p'unchawqa huk p'unchawmi.

Needless to say, he wasn't happy.	Manañam niyta munanichu mana kusisqachu kasqanmanta.
But it is not certain.	Ichaqa manan segurochu.

He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
I wasn’t good enough.	Manam allinchu karqani.
I still know almost nothing about it.	Kunankamapas yaqa mana imatapas chaymantaqa yachanichu.
But it’s not like it is now.	Ichaqa manan kunan hinachu.
That’s what I’m so excited about.	Chayqa anchatam kusikuni.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
In fact, it looked great today.	Chiqaptaqa, kunan punchawqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa.
Yes, then.	Arí, chaymanta.
I doubt it very much.	Anchatam iskayrayani.
But he didn’t do it right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
But I don’t know how to do it.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imayna ruwayta.
It doesn’t seem to be good enough.	Mana allinchu kanman hina.
But things are better than they are now.	Ichaqa imapas aswan allinmi kunan imayna kasqanmantaqa.

He said it was okay.	Payqa allinmi nisqa.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
He didn’t take it seriously.	Payqa manan allintachu qhawarirqan.
Maybe there’s an insurance policy.	Ichapas kanman huk seguro.
Yes, it certainly is.	Arí, cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
Now he’s injured.	Kunanqa k’irisqa kashan.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
You can’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atiwaqchu.

No one knew they were there together.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu kuska chaypi kasqankuta.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
Now I’m sorry.	Kunanqa llakikuni.
More on this, please.	Astawan kaymanta, ama hina kaspa.
But it never worked out.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu karqan.
One day he was there.	Huk punchawmi chaypi karqa.

He agrees to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwananpaqmi arí nin.
How do I do this?.	¿Imaynatataq kayta ruwasaq?.

I'd be fine.	Allinmi kayman.
I was a happy person.	Kusisqa runam karqani.
It was a beautiful sight.	Sumaqmi karqa.
But he's not sure he can.	Ichaqa manan segurochu kashan atisqanmanta.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.

Follow the instructions.	Nisqanman hina ruway.
This wasn’t the case before.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan kay hinachu karqan.

Maybe not as much as before.	Ichapas mana ñawpaq hinachu.
I know it's a good thing.	Allintam yachani.
I said it was okay.	Allinmi nispaymi nirqani.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I am very, very happy.	Ancha ancha kusisqam kachkani.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
I really want to know what's wrong.	Chiqaptam yachayta munani ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I wish I could stop talking.	Munaymanmi manaña rimayta.
He looked better now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan allinmi rikchakurqa.
But maybe this is too hard.	Ichaqa ichapas kayqa llumpay sasa kanman.
This, however, does not seem to be the case.	Kayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
I'm sure about it.	Seguro kani chaymanta.
But he wasn’t quite there.	Ichaqa manan allintachu chaypi kasharqan.
But he says that’s not always the case.	Ichaqa nin manan sapa kutichu chhayna kasqanmanta.
Obviously it does .	Sut'inmi chaytaqa ruwan.
This doesn't mean anything.	Kayqa manam imatapas niyta munanchu.

I mean, it has to be.	Niyta munani, kanan tiyan.
I want to help with something.	Imapipas yanapayta munani.

You know very well how important it is.	Qamqa allintam yachanki chayna ancha allin kasqanmanta.
He wanted to know everything.	Payqa tukuy ima yachayta munarqa.
But that was not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kasharqan.
I'm still not quite sure about this.	Kunankamapas manam allintachu kaymanta seguro kani.
I don’t know anything about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yachanichu.
It probably depends on the circumstances.	Yaqapaschá imapas pasasqanmanta kanqa.
Probably not.	Yaqapaschá mana.
But obviously you should.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwanayki.
I don’t know exactly yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu yachani.
I’m glad that’s the case.	Kusikuni chayna kasqanmanta.

You’ll be there all week.	Tukuy semana chaypi kanki.
He was very angry.	Payqa sinchi phiñasqa kasharqan.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
He knew what it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima kasqanmanta.
Nothing was right.	Manam imapas allintachu karqa.
Indeed, he did.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.

I hadn’t thought of that.	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu.
It wasn’t always that way.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna karqa.

It certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
But, you know, that’s okay.	Ichaqa, yachanki, chayqa allinmi.
I really didn’t want that.	Chiqaptaqa manam chaytaqa munarqanichu.

If only that were the case.	Sichus chay hina kanman karqan chayqa.

You have to do everything on your own.	Tukuy imatam sapallayki ruwanayki.

I thought it might be too much for you.	Yuyarqanim ichapas qampaq llumpay kanman nispa.

He was nervous and scared, he said.	Payqa mancharisqa, mancharisqa ima kasqa, nispa.

Before that, more.	Manaraq chaymanta, astawan.
He is happy about something.	Payqa imamantapas kusisqam kachkan.

But this was a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi karqa.

He's tired all the time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon sayk'usqa kashan.
It's already a bit there.	Ñam huk chikan chaypi kachkan.

He had to do something.	Imatapas ruwanan karqan.
One quick thing though.	Huk utqaylla kaq ichaqa.

It’s better here.	Kaypiqa aswan allinmi.
I think it means two things.	Yuyaykuni iskay ima niyta munan.

I know you are happy.	Yachanim kusisqa kasqaykita.
I think this often, very often.	Kayta sapa kuti, ancha sapa kuti yuyani.
But that wasn’t the case, of course.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan, cheqaqtapunin.

I know this is hard.	Yachanim kayqa sasa kasqanmanta.
That's what you do.	Chayqa imatam ruwanki.
He told her not to do it.	Mana ruwananpaq nisqa.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
He was really good at it.	Payqa chiqaptam chaypi allin karqa.
That would do it, sure.	Chayqa ruwanman, seguro.
I thought that was true.	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensarqani.
If you’re someone else, probably not.	Sichus huk runa kanki chayqa, yaqapaschá mana.

Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.

He was terrified.	Payqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
It’s going to be difficult.	Sasa kanqa.
He knew he couldn’t do it there.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chaypi ruway atisqanmanta.
I like it a lot.	Anchatam gustan.
He was a new man.	Payqa musuq runam karqa.
I think that’s too much.	Ñuqaqa chayta llumpayta yuyani.

He agreed to do so.	Chayta ruwananpaqmi arí nisqa.

He was a human being.	Payqa runam karqa.
I’d rather not.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
I want to say something.	Imatapas niyta munani.
I want to do it faster.	Aswan utqaylla ruwayta munani.
He looked up quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan qhawarirqan.
No one wants to talk about it.	Manam pipas chaymanta rimayta munanchu.
That is doing the wrong thing.	Chayqa mana allintam ruwachkan.
Everything went wrong from there.	Tukuy imapas chaymanta mana allintachu rirqa.

I am very sorry about that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni.

It was a beautiful experience.	Sumaqmi karqan.
You can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manan atiwaqchu.
I doubt it was bad.	Iskayrayani mana allin kasqanmanta.
It’s not good anymore.	Manañam allinchu.
He seemed happy.	Payqa kusisqa hinam karqa.

But if you do, that’s fine.	Ichaqa chayta ruwanki chayqa, allinmi.
That would be a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi kanman.

He didn't know if he would, but he didn't know.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chayta ruwananta icha manachus chayta, ichaqa manan yacharqanchu.

He can do it now.	Payqa kunanmi ruwayta atinman.

You can’t do it again.	Manan hukmanta atiwaqchu.
He shouldn’t be like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu kanan.

He was supposed to be happy.	Payqa kusisqa kanan karqan.
You either do this or you don’t.	Kayta ruwanki icha mana.

Today is the third day.	Kunan punchawmi kimsa punchaw.

No one knew where he was.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
That seemed to be the case.	Chayqa kanman hinam karqa.

It certainly would be.	Chiqaptam chayna kanman.
It’s just not here.	Chaylla mana kaypichu.

A really bad guy.	Chiqap mana allin runa.
Nothing easy about it.	Mana imapas facilchu chaymanta.
I couldn’t tell you.	Manam niyta atirqanichu.
He had to be tired.	Payqa sayk’usqa kanan karqan.
That was always a bad thing to do.	Chayqa sapa kutim mana allin ruway karqa.
I couldn’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atirqanichu.
I can't say anything about that.	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas niyta atiymanchu.
It’s not a good thing to do.	Manan allinchu chay ruwayqa.
Nothing was right.	Manam imapas allinchu karqa.
Nothing else.	Manaña imapas.
That was the only thing that happened.	Chayqa hinallam karqa.

He was scared, that was all.	Payqa mancharisqa, chaylla karqa.
That’s great, man.	Chayqa ancha allinmi, runa.
Fortunately, there seemed to be plenty.	Ancha kusisqa, achka hinam karqa.

He did a little bit wrong.	Payqa huk chhikantan mana allintachu ruwarqan.
Forgive me, forgive me.	Pampachaykuway, pampachaykuway.
I don’t care about that now.	Kunanqa manan chaymantaqa imananpaschu.

I couldn’t get over it.	Manam atipayta atirqanichu.
Now you have to do that again.	Kunanqa hukmanta chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
He said he wasn't feeling well.	Payqa mana allinchu kashasqanmanta nirqa.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
He couldn’t have done that.	Manan chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.

Wouldn’t that be great?.	¿Manachu chayqa hatun kanman?.
Can’t say how good it was.	Mana rimayta atinchu imayna allin kasqanmanta.

It’s not that bad.	Mana chayna mana allinchu.
That wasn’t the case, happily.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu karqan, kusisqa.
Last night, maybe.	Qayna tuta, kanman.
You have been with us for a very long time.	Ancha ñawpaqmantaraqmi ñuqaykuwan kachkanki.

He couldn't keep up with her.	Payqa manan paywan kuska kayta atirqanchu.

If he wanted to do that, fine.	Sichus chayta ruwayta munarqan chayqa, allinmi.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
I can’t do it.	Manam ruwayta atiymanchu.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
That is not an easy task.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu.

He was there the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon chaypi kasharqan.
I don’t want to be this.	Manam kayta munanichu.

There is no certainty that this will happen.	Manan kanchu seguro kay pasananta.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqan.
I think that's his name.	Chayqa sutinmi nispaymi piensani.
I know it’s coming.	Yachanim hamunanta.

You have to do it right.	Allintam ruwanayki.
I don’t know how you figure that out.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus chayta yuyaykunki chayta.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
But that is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kashan.
But it doesn’t matter now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa imananpaschu.
He knows he’s here.	Payqa yachanmi kaypi kashasqanmanta.
He couldn’t believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
All is well here.	Tukuy allinmi kaypi.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
I didn’t really want to do it.	Manam anchatachu ruwayta munarqani.

That's a lot of good.	Chayqa achka allinmi.
I know where you are.	Yachanim maypi kasqaykita.

It would be very useful.	Ancha allinmi kanman.
I mean, this one.	Niyta munani, kayta.
It’s a good one.	Allinmi kachkan.

It’s not easy.	Manam facilchu.
He said yes to it.	Payqa arí nisqa.

He wasn’t like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu kasharqan.

I was, like, two.	Ñuqaqa karqani, hina, iskay.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
Man, that was bad.	Runa, chayqa mana allinchu karqan.
Doing just about anything would be better.	Yaqa tukuy imatapas ruwayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
The first is the	Ñawpaq kaq.
He is doing a good job.	Payqa allintam ruwachkan.
Said it was nothing.	Nisqa mana imapas kasqanmanta.
You know, he's fine.	Yachanki, payqa allinmi kachkan.
Something didn't seem quite right.	Imapas mana allintachu rikchakurqa.
He doesn’t really know what it is.	Payqa manan allintachu yachan imachus kasqanmanta.
Another big no no.	Huk hatun mana mana.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
Yes, I do, too.	Arí, ñuqapas.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kasqa.
But it is not so sure.	Ichaqa manan chay hina segurochu.
Everything went well, everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa, tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
I never saw that coming.	Mana hayk’aqpas chay hamunanta rikurqanichu.
You do it, you do it.	Qamqa ruwanki, ruwanki.

Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
He will do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanqa.
He was in deep distress.	Payqa sinchitan llakisqa kasharqan.
I really want to do that.	Anchatan munani chayta ruwayta.
Not everything is safe or secure.	Manan tukuy imapas segurochu nitaq segurochu.
He is sure of it.	Payqa segurom chaymantaqa kachkan.
But he didn’t want to be here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu kayta munarqan.
He did it right.	Payqa allintan chaytaqa ruwarqan.
But, it’s okay now.	Ichaqa, kunanqa allinmi.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
You think about something.	Imapipas yuyaykunki.
It should be clear.	Sut’inmi kanan.
Maybe it will be more interesting for you.	Ichapas aswan sumaq kanqa qampaq.
The right thing, the right thing .	Allin kaq, allin kaq .
That means that it is difficult to do so.	Chayqa niyta munan, chayta ruwayqa sasa kasqanmanta.
You have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki tiyan.
You are or you are not.	Qamqa kanki icha mana.
I don’t want to tell you anything.	Manam imatapas willayta munanichu.
He couldn’t speak.	Payqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
No one has that.	Chaytaqa manan pipas kanchu.
It's almost always like a day.	Yaqa sapa kuti huk punchaw hinam.
That means a lot of talking and then more talking.	Chayqa niyta munan achka rimayta chaymanta aswan rimayta.
Yes, he was, he was.	Arí, payqa karqan.
He can't win, you know.	Payqa manam atipayta atinchu, yachanki.

He had to do the right thing.	Payqa allintam ruwanan karqa.
He's a very nice guy, actually.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam, chiqaptaqa.
He’ll be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa.
That means something.	Chayqa imapas niyta munan.
Yes please, do it.	Arí ama hina kaspa, ruway.
It was to continue.	Chayqa hinallam kanan karqa.
But it had been a long time.	Ichaqa unayñan kasqa.
I just ask myself.	Chaylla tapukuni.
That seems a bit excessive.	Chayqa huk chikan llumpay hinam.
He is eager to succeed.	Payqa anchatam munan allinta ruwayta.
It may never happen again.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas chay hinachu kanqa.
He’s not like that though.	Payqa manan chay hinachu ichaqa.
I am still very depressed.	Hinallam sinchi llakisqa kachkani.
That may not have been a good thing.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu karqan.
This is going to be tough.	Kayqa sinchi sasa kanqa.
I wonder why that is.	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayna kasqanmanta.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He can’t, of course.	Payqa manan atinchu, sut’inmi.
You’re not here to stay.	Manam kaypichu kachkanki.
That’s not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanqa.
I just didn’t know what to do.	Chaylla mana yacharqanichu imata ruwanayta.
He had to do something first.	Ñawpaqtaqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
Here's a date.	Kaypi huk p'unchaw.
You certainly wouldn’t want things to be like that.	Cheqaqtapunin mana munawaqchu imapas chhayna kananta.
He didn’t know where he was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
He was always so happy.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna kusisqa karqa.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Everyone is sure of it.	Lliwmi chaymantaqa seguro kachkanku.

But this is very interesting.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
This is a man.	Kayqa runa.
Make this what you want.	Kayta ruway munasqaykita.
He did the right thing.	Payqa allintan ruwarqan.
This one really wanted to.	Kayqa chiqaptam munarqa.

He said it was something.	Payqa imapas kasqanmantam nirqa.
Yes, he knew it.	Arí, payqa yacharqanmi.

This can be very useful.	Kayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
Actually it would be good.	Chiqaptaqa allinmi kanman.
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
It’s going to be tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kanqa.
It probably wasn’t good enough.	Manapaschá allinchu karqan.
But that was the past.	Ichaqa chayqa ñawpaq tiempon karqan.
Of course, you never knew what was going to happen.	Arí, manam haykapipas yacharqankichu ima pasananta.

That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Maybe a lot of things.	Ichapas achka imapas.
That would be nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman.
I'll go, for so long.	Risaq, chayna unayta.
He seemed nervous.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam karqa.
He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manan atirqanchu.
Maybe, but probably not.	Ichapas, ichaqa manapaschá.
Maybe it will do well.	Ichapas allinta ruwanman.
That’s a good, very good thing.	Chayqa allinmi, ancha allinmi.
But then you don’t know.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa manan yachankichu.

The former is better.	Ñawpaqtaqa aswan allinmi.

That was nothing you could do.	Chayqa manan imapas atiwaqchu karqan.
That’ll be something.	Chayqa imapas kanqa.

But this is not the case now.	Ichaqa manan kay hinachu kunanqa.
He really doesn’t know anything.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa mana imatapas yachanchu.

Obviously something is wrong.	Sut’inmi imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.

Something is good.	Imapas allinmi.
He couldn’t face this now.	Payqa manan kunanqa kayta atipayta atirqanchu.

You can’t do it.	Manam atiwaqchu.

But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
But it was beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi karqa.
I can never tell.	Manam haykapipas willayta atiymanchu.
He can’t believe he did.	Payqa manan creeyta atinchu chayta ruwasqanmanta.

I often wonder what he is doing now.	Sapa kutim tapukuni kunan ima ruwasqanmanta.

It would have been nice.	Sumaqmi kanman karqa.
Now this is a good guy.	Kunanqa kayqa allin runam.
But of course you knew that.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chaytaqa yacharqanki.
Maybe it never seemed like it.	Ichapas mana haykapipas chayna hinachu karqa.
You just didn’t know.	Chaylla mana yacharqankichu.
But I don’t think he will.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykunichu chayta ruwananta.

You don’t know what it’s going to be like.	Mana yachankichu imayna kananta.
I really couldn't tell you why.	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atirqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.

He didn’t want to know what was in it.	Payqa manan yachayta munarqanchu imakuna chaypi kashasqanmanta.
Okay, he didn't say that exactly.	Allinmi, manam chaytaqa allintachu nirqa.
Now there is nothing.	Kunanqa manam imapas kanchu.
I would never have done that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa.
Indeed, it was.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
What is the third.	Imataq kimsa kaq.
Hopefully it will happen soon.	Munaymanmi chaylla pasananta.
He refused to say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas rimayta munarqanchu.
He had no idea what had happened.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imachus pasasqanmanta.
You have to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanayki.

Never, never, never.	Mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas.
But it wasn’t really.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu karqan.
That shouldn’t be the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
Actually, this is not good.	Chiqaptaqa kayqa manam allinchu.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.

But then, then, nothing.	Ichaqa chaymanta, chaymanta, mana imapas.
It’s not like it’s here.	Manam kaypi hinachu.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Obviously, he didn’t know what to do.	Sut’inmi, payqa manan yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.

I had always wanted to go there.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayman riyta munarqani.

That’s right, yes.	Chayna, arí.
He can’t do anything about it.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta atinmanchu.
It would never be right.	Manam haykapipas allinchu kanman.
He knows you are busy.	Payqa yachanmi ocupasqa kasqaykita.
He must be a good man.	Payqa allin runam kanan.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa.
It doesn’t exist anymore.	Manañan chaytaqa kanchu.
He was happy, he said.	Payqa kusisqa kasqa, nispa.
Such a man, such a man.	Chayna runa, chayna runa.
He would love to talk to you.	Payqa anchatam munanman qamwan rimayta.

That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
He always wanted to be there.	Payqa sapa kutim chaypi kananta munarqa.
I wanted to tell him not to do that.	Chaytaqa ama ruwananpaqmi niyta munarqani.
Follow the instructions.	Nisqanman hina ruway.
I was scared, really really scared.	Mancharisqa karqani, chiqap chiqap mancharisqa.
But it never worked out.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu karqan.
Someone had to do it.	Pipas chayta ruwanan karqan.
You can’t do anything about it.	Manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Loneliness is a bad thing.	Sapallan kayqa mana allinmi.
He was like that.	Payqa chayna hinam karqa.
You may never know how many there are.	Manapaschá hayk’aqpas yachankichu hayk’a kasqanmantaqa.
I think you did that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwasqaykita.
But this is not really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu kayqa.
He doesn’t care anymore.	Payqa manañan imananpaschu.
That really says something.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin imatapas nin.
Nothing more, or less.	Mana imapas aswan, nitaq pisi.
Almost there, but not quite.	Yaqa chaypi, ichaqa mana allintachu.

But he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I didn't think anyone would.	Manam piensarqanichu pipas chayta ruwananta.
No! 	Manam!
He doesn’t live here.	Payqa manam kaypichu tiyan.
He was beautiful, you know.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa, yachanki.
He had never been so sure.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hina segurochu karqan.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
It's actually bad actually.	Chiqaptaqa mana allinmi chiqaptaqa.
It didn't look safe.	Manam segurochu rikchakurqa.
The third day of the month.	Kimsa kaq p’unchaw.
Yes, it was such a day.	Arí, chayna punchawmi karqa.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmanta.

It’s good to be here.	Kaypi kayqa allinmi.
He said it wasn't.	Payqa mana chayna kasqanmanta nirqa.
I’m going to do the right thing.	Ñuqaqa allintam ruwasaq.
But this morning.	Ichaqa kunan paqarinmi.
Someone has to do it.	Pipas ruwanan tiyan.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
It would be better to do so now.	Aswan allinmi kanman kunan chayta ruwayqa.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
Maybe it was the case.	Ichapas chayna karqa.
But it wasn’t easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu karqan.
I never saw this coming.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu kay hamunanta.
There’s just no time.	Chaylla mana tiempo kanchu.
I didn’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta munarqanichu.
I wonder why that is.	Tapukunitaqmi imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
But he couldn’t be.	Ichaqa manan kayta atirqanchu.
He is here now.	Payqa kunanmi kaypi kachkan.
He wasn’t going to do it alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu chayta ruwanan karqan.
Do the first step.	Ñawpaq kaq ruwayta ruway.
He's doing really well.	Payqa chiqaptam allinta ruwachkan.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It’s not a good thing to do.	Manan allinchu chay ruwayqa.
It looked very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
Very good but so, very bad.	Ancha allin ichaqa chayna, ancha mana allin.
That’s what it does, though.	Chaytan ichaqa ruwan.
I knew that was the case.	Chaytaqa yacharqanim.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa.
It’s not anymore.	Manañam.
In fact, it was as if he had never been there.	Chiqaptaqa, mana haykapipas chaypi kaq hinam karqa.
He’s very, very good.	Payqa ancha ancha allinmi.
No one wants that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas munanchu.

Everything was wonderful.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi karqa.

I really want to help.	Anchatam yanapayta munani.
This would not be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman.
That means you are a better person now.	Chayqa kunan aswan allin runa kasqaykita niyta munan.
The first day would have been better.	Ñawpaq p’unchay aswan allin kanman karqan.
He didn't seem right.	Payqa manam allinchu rikchakurqa.
Almost every night now, in fact.	Yaqa sapa tuta kunan, chiqaptaqa.
Why why why.	Imarayku imarayku.
. . . .	.
A great one.	Huk hatun.
He does well at it.	Payqa allintam chaypi ruwan.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
Clearly, this is not the case.	Sut’inmi kashan mana chay hinachu.
You are like a human being.	Huk runa hinam kanki.
It wasn’t easy.	Manam facilchu karqa.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
That’s obviously wrong.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.
It doesn’t matter anymore.	Manañam imananpaschu.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Please, please.	Ama hina kaspa.
He obviously loved it.	Payqa sut’inmi chayta anchata munarqan.
He didn’t think you would.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu chayta ruwanaykita.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
First of all, it wouldn’t work.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan allinchu kanman.
I doubt it ever will.	Iskayrayani haykapipas chayna kananta.
There’s no real me.	Manam chiqap ñuqaqa kanchu.
Fortunately he was.	Ancha kusisqa payqa karqan.
But something else.	Ichaqa huk imapas.
It can’t be that simple.	Manan chay hina facilchu kanman.
That was maybe, maybe, the right thing to do.	Chayqa ichapas, ichapas, allin ruway karqa.
I don’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachanichu.
We’re all right.	Allinmi kanchik.
You may not know.	Manapaschá yachankichu.

Great performance here.	Hatun ruway kaypi.
I want to know the whole story.	Tukuy willayta yachayta munani.
I know how to play the game.	Pukllayta yachani.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
Of course, it still takes time.	Arí, hinallam tiempota necesitan.
But it’s not that good.	Ichaqa manan chay hina allinchu.
That it is not true.	Mana chiqap kasqanmanta.
But that’s what he did.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwarqan.
But that is no longer the case.	Ichaqa manañan kunanqa chay hinachu.
Maybe too well.	Ichapas ancha allinta.
I wanted to talk to you first.	Ñawpaqtaqa qanwan rimayta munarqani.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
If you don’t want to, you don’t.	Mana munaspaqa manam.
I’m going to do this right.	Kayta allinta ruwasaq.
I didn’t want to be here.	Manam kaypi kayta munarqanichu.
He had to do it.	Payqa ruwanan karqan.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He didn't know that was the case.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chhayna kasqanmantaqa.
I thought that was really, really cool.	Chayqa chiqap, chiqap sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Tomorrow is a great day.	Paqarinmi hatun punchaw.
He probably did it.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqan.
You know, always bigger.	Yachanki, sapa kuti aswan hatun.
But there was something.	Ichaqa imapas karqa.
I’m afraid it’s there.	Manchakuni chaypi kasqanmanta.
It will be a little different.	Huk chikan chikan kanqa.
It’s not there anymore.	Manañam kanchu.
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
Perhaps he was.	Ichapas payqa karqa.
But I never really thought about that much before.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa anchatachu yuyaykurqani ñawpaqtaqa.
He is not seriously injured.	Payqa manan anchatachu k’irisqa kashan.
Here he is alone.	Kaypiqa sapallanmi.
It was such a day.	Chayna punchawmi karqa.
That is what he refused to do.	Chaytan payqa mana ruwayta munarqanchu.
It should have been a long time ago.	Unayñan kanan karqan.
There was a man.	Huk runam karqa.
That was no, no.	Chayqa karqan manan, manan.
That’s like here, like here.	Chayqa kaypi hina, kaypi hina.
You’re pretty busy, after all.	Allin ocupasqa kanki, tukuy imamanta.
Anything else.	Imamantapas.
That would have been a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman karqa.
But in the present day.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa.
That's obviously wrong.	Chayqa sut'inmi mana allinchu.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Manam yachanichu ima pasananta.
He was angry and upset.	Payqa phiñasqa, phiñasqa ima kasqa.
Do it there, not here.	Chaypi ruway, ama kaypichu.
But otherwise, not really.	Ichaqa mana chayqa, manan cheqaqtachu.
He seemed happy and carefree.	Payqa kusisqa mana llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Please, can you please.	Ama hina kaspa, ¿atiwaqchu.
You know how to talk.	Rimayta yachanki.
I didn’t know why, really.	Manam yacharqanichu imarayku, chiqaptapuni.
You are a better person.	Aswan allin runam kanki.
I just want to help.	Chaylla yanapayta munani.
He knew where he was.	Payqa yacharqanmi maypi kashasqanmanta.
It’s not that simple.	Manan chay hina facilchu.
Much, much happier!.	¡Aswan, aswan kusisqa!.
That’s not a good thing though.	Chayqa manan allinchu ichaqa.
I’m not unhappy.	Manam mana kusisqachu kani.
He made a lot of money.	Achka qullqita ruwarqa.
But you can’t tell.	Ichaqa manan willayta atiwaqchu.
Yes, that is better.	Arí, chayqa aswan allinmi.
This one does.	Kayqa ruwan.
It wouldn’t be a good thing.	Mana allinchu kanman.
I never thought it would happen.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chayna kananta.
This process was not very successful.	Kay ruwayqa mana ancha allinchu karqa.
It was a wonderful day.	Chay punchawqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I wonder why that is.	Tapukunitaqmi imanasqataq chayna kasqanmanta.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
I'll do that.	Chayta ruwasaq.
Three times daily for two to three days.	Kimsa kuti sapa punchaw iskay kimsa punchaw.
It’s very, very nice.	Ancha, ancha sumaqmi.
I wonder about that.	Chayta tapukuni.
He was pretty much alone now.	Payqa kunanqa yaqa sapallanmi kasqa.
I know what’s coming.	Yachanim ima hamunanta.
Not angry like that.	Mana phiñasqa chayna.
Like, really great.	Imayna, chiqap hatun.

Everything is fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
I couldn’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu.
Now it doesn’t matter.	Kunanqa manan imananpaschu.
I can’t speak to you.	Manam rimayta atinichu.
I am there every day.	Sapa punchawmi chaypi kachkani.
Everything is as it should be.	Tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam.
He was quick, but there was something about him.	Payqa usqhayllan karqan, ichaqa imapas paywan kasharqan.
That was the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allinmi karqa.
The action is very important.	Ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
Other than that, nothing.	Huk chaymanta, mana imapas.
He doesn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu.
I just know there are a lot of them.	Chaylla yachani achka kasqanmanta.
I really want to know.	Chiqaptam yachayta munani.
It still needs a lot of work though.	Hinallam achka llamkayta necesitan ichaqa.

All very good.	Tukuy ancha allin.
But it was a long time ago now.	Ichaqa unayñan kunanqa karqan.
Can’t say too much.	Mana llumpayta niyta atinchu.
I don’t want to know.	Manam yachayta munanichu.
But that doesn’t matter here.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manan kaypiqa imananpaschu.
It just had to be.	Chaylla kanan karqa.
This is not going to be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanqa.
I can’t seem to do this.	Manapaschá kayta ruwayta atiymanchu hina.
No, more than that.	Manan, chaymanta aswan.
He had been depressed for a long time.	Payqa unayñan llakisqa kasharqan.
He knew it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi.
I'm fine with it.	Ñuqaqa allintam kachkani.
If he is sure.	Sichus payqa seguro kashan chayqa.
It’s really hard to do.	Cheqaqtapunin sasa ruwayqa.
Yes, that would be a bad thing.	Arí, chayqa mana allinmi kanman.
The earlier the better.	Aswan ñawpaqtaqa aswan allinmi.
I don’t really know what it’s like.	Manam allintachu yachani imayna kasqanmanta.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
That 's	Chayqa .
He wanted to talk to me.	Payqa ñuqawan rimayta munarqa.
This is not unique.	Kayqa manam sapallanchu.
I wish you would do it soon.	Munaymanmi chaylla ruwanaykita.
This one does that perfectly.	Kayqa chaytaqa allintam ruwan.
Be sure of that.	Chaymanta seguro kay.
But something else.	Ichaqa imapas.
He is terrified of everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta mancharisqa kachkan.
No one is alone here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas sapallanchu kachkan.
But that was a bad thing.	Ichaqa chayqa mana allinmi karqan.
He was such a man.	Payqa chayna runam karqa.
He was such a man.	Payqa chayna runam karqa.
I always thought that.	Sapa kutim chaytaqa piensarqani.
I almost can’t believe it.	Yaqa mana creeyta atinichu.
What will it be for you?.	¿Imataq qampaq kanqa?.
All very quickly.	Tukuy ancha utqaylla.
He is alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kachkan.
You know it never happened.	Yachanki mana haykapipas chayna kasqanmanta.
Nothing else much.	Mana imapas huk anchatachu.
I want to do that more.	Chayta astawan ruwayta munani.

That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
You have to do something.	Imatapas ruwanayki.
Tomorrow would do better.	Paqarinmi aswan allinta ruwanman.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
I really can’t tell.	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atinichu.
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
I couldn’t really say anything.	Manam chiqaptaqa imatapas niyta atirqanichu.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I know it’s going to happen.	Yachanim chayna kananta.
I was very uncomfortable.	Anchatam mana allinchu karqani.
More than this.	Aswan kaymanta.
That's good .	Chayqa, allinmi .
He says it’s okay.	Payqa allinmi nin.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He was alone now.	Payqa kunanqa sapallanmi kasqa.
Something more beautiful.	Imapas aswan sumaq.
You never know, really.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu, chiqaptaqa.
But you can’t do anything about it.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
You will do it one day.	Huk punchawmi ruwanki.
That's actually not that good.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa manam chayna allinchu.
Second, nothing else.	Iskay kaq, mana imapas.
He couldn’t believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
Maybe you do, maybe you don’t.	Ichapas chayta ruwanki, ichapas mana.
Maybe a.	Ichapas huk.
I'm good.	Allinmi kani.
I was the best.	Ñuqaqa aswan allinmi karqani.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
I don't know if you know.	Mana yachanichu yachanki icha manachu.
He would be alone there otherwise.	Payqa sapallanmi chaypi kanman mana chayqa.
That made the game.	Chayqa chay pukllayta ruwarqa.
But he is not as angry as I am.	Ichaqa manan ñoqawan hinachu phiñasqa kashan.
Where is it located? 	Maypitaq kachkan?
I was a new person.	Musuq runam karqani.
It’s always been there.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
It’s going to be tomorrow.	Paqarinmi kanqa.
Something is really wrong.	Chiqaptam imapas mana allinchu.
You know that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi yachanki.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
I never knew why.	Manam haykapipas yacharqanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
One though.	Huk ichaqa.
I didn’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu.
That means a lot, actually.	Chayqa anchatam niyta munan, chiqaptaqa.
I don't care what it looks like.	Manam imananpaschu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
Now, actually.	Kunanqa, chiqaptaqa.
I can’t believe it.	Mana creeyta atinichu.
I’m sorry this happened.	Pampachaykuway kay pasasqanmanta.
But he couldn’t go.	Ichaqa manan riyta atirqanchu.
That is every day of every week of the year.	Chayqa sapa wata sapa semana sapa punchawmi.
That was the most interesting thing.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi karqa.
He always refused.	Payqa sapa kutim mana munarqanchu.
I’m not at all sure he did.	Manam imapipas segurochu kani chay ruwasqanmanta.
It meant so much.	Anchatan niyta munarqan.
I am not sure if it is.	Manam segurochu kani sichus chayna kasqanmantaqa.
He wanted to know everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yachayta munarqa.
He didn’t want that anymore.	Payqa manañan chayta munarqanchu.
He didn’t really want to know.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu yachayta munarqan.
What he’s done.	Ima ruwasqanmanta.
It really is.	Chiqaptam chayna.
I don't ever want that to happen.	Manam haykapipas chayna kananta munanichu.
It was a wonderful day.	Chay punchawqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
A nice one, actually.	Huk sumaq, chiqaptaqa.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
I don’t like it.	Manam gustawanchu.
New Year's Eve.	Musuq wata.
This is obvious.	Kayqa sut’inmi.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allin runam karqa.
Today would be nice, okay.	Kunan punchawqa sumaqmi kanman, allinmi.
It will be very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi kanqa.
This was indeed a beautiful day.	Cheqaqtapunin kayqa sumaq p’unchay karqan.
Everything is as it should be.	Tukuy imapas kanan hinam kachkan.
What a very nice sight.	Ima ancha sumaqmi.
But he said a lot.	Ichaqa achkatam nirqa.
I think he might be a little angry.	Yuyaykuni huk chhikanta phiñasqa kanman.
It’s not always good.	Manan sapa kutichu allin.
That probably didn't seem right.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu rikchakurqa.
You don’t know that.	Chaytaqa manam yachankichu.
He had to do it right.	Payqa allintan chayta ruwanan karqan.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
That's going to be really bad.	Chayqa chiqap mana allinmi kanqa.
It’s all very important to be good.	Tukuy ancha allinmi allin kay.
He didn’t seem nervous.	Payqa manan mancharisqa hinachu karqan.
But it probably will be.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá kanqa.
He wished he wasn’t so tired.	Payqa mana chayna sayk’usqa kananta munarqa.
Perhaps that is not simple or easy.	Yaqapaschá chayqa manan facilchu nitaq facilchu.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
This is not a very good thing.	Kayqa manam ancha allinchu.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
I couldn’t get over it.	Manam atipayta atirqanichu.
But now it’s okay.	Ichaqa kunanqa allinmi.
This second approach is more interesting.	Kay iskay kaq ruwayqa aswan sumaqmi.
I mean what it is.	Niyta munani imachus kasqanmanta.
Yes, he was alone.	Arí, payqa sapallanmi kasqa.
He said it was a big deal.	Payqa hatun ruway kasqanmantam nirqa.
But it was nice, you know.	Ichaqa sumaqmi karqan, yachanki.
Now I don't know what to do.	Kunanqa manam yachanichu imata ruwanaypaq.
That would have been it.	Chayqa kanman karqan.
You will have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki kanqa.
But it is likely that .	Ichaqa yaqapaschá .
I am very sorry about that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
It can’t be this.	Mana kayta atinchu.
It wasn’t safe at all.	Manan imapipas segurochu karqan.
I'm always here.	Sapa kutim kaypi kachkani.
I was okay with it.	Allinmi karqani.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I know he didn't.	Yachanim mana chayta ruwasqanmanta.
He probably would have.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanman karqan.
But it’s not very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu.
It’s really hard.	Chiqaptam sinchi.
But something else.	Ichaqa huk imapas.
But that doesn’t mean anything.	Ichaqa chayqa manan imatapas niyta munanchu.
It was like last time.	Qayna kuti hinam karqa.
He seemed really upset.	Payqa chiqap phiñasqa hinam karqa.
He will go every day.	Sapa punchawmi rinqa.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Too much, every week.	Llumpay, sapa semana.
He was a human being.	Payqa runam karqa.
You have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki.
I wonder about it all.	Tukuy chaymanta tapukuni.
If yes, that’s fine.	Sichus arí, allinmi.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He was everything.	Payqa tukuy imapas karqa.
You know, before .	Yachanki, manaraq .
You’ll be all morning.	Tukuy paqarinmi kanki.
Such a person.	Chayna runa.
But, a couple of things.	Ichaqa, huk iskay imakuna.
That doesn’t really do it.	Chayqa manan cheqaqtachu ruwan.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
It’s always the same.	Sapa kutim chayna.
He was human, once.	Payqa runam karqa, huk kuti.
Everything seemed fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa.
I can’t not be there.	Manam mana chaypi kayta atiymanchu.
You’re good at this.	Kaypiqa allinmi kanki.
I don't want to do it here.	Kaypiqa manam ruwayta munanichu.
I was never sure about that.	Manam haykapipas chaymantaqa segurochu karqani.
Not sure where.	Mana segurochu maypi.
But it would be nice.	Ichaqa sumaqmi kanman.
Actually more than one.	Chiqaptaqa aswan hukmanta.
That wasn’t easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan.
I don't know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa kasqanmanta.
This process is very important.	Kay ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
He was such a great guy.	Payqa chayna hatun runam karqa.
He wants to talk to her.	Paywan rimayta munan.
Maybe he’s difficult.	Ichapas payqa sasa kanman.
He couldn’t be this.	Payqa manan kayta atirqanchu.
It didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu karqa.
They don’t care.	Paykunaqa manan imananpaschu.
He would have been hurt.	Payqa k’irisqa kanman karqan.
I really wanted to win this.	Kayta atipayta anchata munarqani.
That is not an easy task.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu.
I wonder where he is.	Maypi kasqanmanta tapukuni.
I really like it here.	Kaypiqa anchatam gustan.
Great, that’s better.	Hatun, chayqa aswan allinmi.
We haven’t been this happy in a long time.	Unayñan mana kay hina kusisqachu kayku.

It was going to be a beautiful day.	Sumaq punchawmi kanan karqa.
Now it’s okay.	Kunanqa allinmi.
I certainly did that.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqani.
It’s not good otherwise.	Mana allinchu mana chayqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa.

I didn’t want that to happen.	Manam munarqanichu chayna kananta.

He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
He had no idea what would happen next.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imachus chaymanta pasananta.
He was a new man.	Payqa musuq runam karqa.

She really wanted to be with him.	Payqa anchatam munarqa paywan kayta.
He never really was.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu karqan.

He doesn’t want to.	Manam munanchu.

He had to do the right thing.	Payqa allintam ruwanan karqa.

I can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwaymanchu.
I know otherwise it is true.	Yachanim mana chayqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
But it was really hard to do.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sasa karqan chayta ruwayqa.
Yes, that was a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi karqa.
Obviously I've done something wrong.	Sut'inmi imapas mana allin ruwasqayta.
He was in a state of distress.	Payqa llakisqa kasharqan.
Everyone is good.	Lliwmi allin kanku.
No, it’s not.	Manan, manan.

Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu karqa.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.

It was a very serious injury.	Ancha sinchi k’irisqa karqan.
You can’t do it here.	Kaypiqa manan atiwaqchu.

He is not up to it.	Payqa manan chayman hinachu kashan.

Do whatever you want.	Ima munasqaykita ruway.

That is not a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa manan allinchu.
You still want him to fail.	Hinallam munanki mana allinta ruwananta.

You’re not good enough.	Manam allinchu kanki.

Everyone is really excited.	Lliwmi chiqaptapuni kusisqa kachkanku.
I’m not sure about that.	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu kani.
I’ve always wanted to say that.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayta niyta munarqani.
Performance was excellent.	Ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
That everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allin kasqanmanta.
Maybe the third one.	Ichapas kimsa kaq kaq.
I’m not sure what the best course of action would be.	Manam segurochu kani ima aswan allin ruway kanman chayta.
He is not here now.	Payqa manan kunanqa kaypichu kashan.
He seemed very upset.	Payqa ancha llakisqa hinam karqa.
I want to, too!.	¡Ñuqapas munani!.
He had no idea where he was.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
Where is it located? 	¿Maypitaq kachkan?
I know what will happen.	Yachanim imakuna pasananta.
I never wanted to be any different.	Manam haykapipas huk hina kaytaqa munarqanichu.
He really wanted to be there.	Payqa anchatan munarqan chaypi kayta.
It’s beautiful.	Sumaqmi.
He really wants to talk to you.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin qanwan rimayta munan.
He couldn’t have known.	Payqa manan yachayta atinmanchu karqan.
He was happy to do so.	Payqa kusisqam chayta ruwarqa.
It won’t be easy.	Manam facilchu kanqa.
But this is worse.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan mana allinmi.
That was all good.	Chayqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
He wanted to go.	Payqa riyta munarqa.
Have a nice day!!!.	Qampaq allin punchaw!!!.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
Maybe this is it.	Ichapas kay.
It will probably be here.	Kaypiqa yaqapaschá kanqa.
But everything went wrong.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
I wasn’t sure about that though.	Manam chaymantaqa segurochu karqani ichaqa.
That was certainly the case.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin karqan.
Yeah, that seems better.	Arí, chayqa aswan allinmi rikchakun.
They probably still exist.	Yaqapaschá kunankamapas kachkanku.
You don’t know what happened to me.	Mana yachankichu imachus ñuqawan pasasqanmanta.
He can't come.	Payqa manam hamuyta atinmanchu.
I’m really excited.	Chiqaptam kusisqa kachkani.
The worst part of it.	Aswan mana allin kaq.
He is doing it all on his own.	Payqa sapallanmi tukuy chayta ruwachkan.
Such a great guy.	Chayna hatun runa.
I’d be happy too.	Ñuqapas kusisqa kayman.
It's not that bad here.	Kaypiqa manam chayna mana allinchu.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
I couldn’t believe that.	Chaytaqa manan creeyta atirqanichu.
Almost too big.	Yaqa ancha hatun.
I know this is hard.	Yachanim kayqa sasa kasqanmanta.
Yes, it is	Arí, chayqa .
If that’s all.	Sichus chaylla.
What does it say? 	¿Ima nin?

No one knows for sure.	Manan pipas allintachu yachan.
I really like him.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa gustan.
I’m not happy with it.	Manam kusisqachu kani.
But they are not very good.	Ichaqa manan ancha allinchu kanku.
I’m a human being.	Ñuqaqa runam kani.
I almost want him to.	Yaqapaschá munani chayta ruwananta.
It’s never that simple.	Manan hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu.
But I’m a little worried about something.	Ichaqa imamantapas huk chhikantan llakikuni.
But everything seemed too much.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas llumpay hinam karqa.
That wasn’t a bad thing.	Chayqa manam mana allinchu karqa.
He was always alone.	Sapa kutim sapallan karqa.
That seemed unlikely.	Chayqa manapaschá hinachu karqan.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
He loves to talk about me.	Payqa anchatam munan ñuqamanta rimayta.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.
He is doing a good job.	Payqa allintam ruwachkan.
Everything is excellent.	Tukuy imapas ancha allinmi.
It would be more human.	Aswan runa hina kanman.
Now, though, it’s! 	¡Kunanmi ichaqa!
. . . .	.
Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi.
I wonder why.	Tapukuni imarayku.
This, however, is not easy.	Kayqa ichaqa manan facilchu.
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
You are not good at this.	Kaypiqa manam allinchu kanki.
What’s wrong with that.	Imataq mana allinchu.
I don’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachanichu.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kasqanmantaqa.
I don't know.	Manam yachanichu.
How do you do it.	Imaynatataq ruwanki.
Tomorrow is a big day.	Paqarin hatun punchawmi.
Indeed, it was.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
I don’t know how to talk.	Manam yachanichu imayna rimayta.
He looked bad, really bad.	Payqa mana allinchu rikchakurqa, chiqap mana allinchu.
Otherwise the process will fail.	Mana chayqa chay ruwayqa mana allintachu ruwanqa.
I know it is the right thing to do.	Yachanim allin ruway kasqanmanta.
I knew this would happen.	Yacharqanim kay pasananta.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manan atirqanchu.
This is not good man.	Kayqa manam allinchu runa.
Maybe that’s the right thing to do.	Ichapas chayna allin kanman.
Less than that.	Aswan pisi chaymanta.
It just doesn’t.	Chaylla mana.
I still think it is.	Hinallam piensani chayna kasqanmanta.
He wants to win.	Payqa atipayta munan.
Perhaps he will do so.	Yaqapaschá chaynata ruwanman.
But it wasn’t like anything else.	Ichaqa manan huk hinachu karqan.
He can’t do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atinmanchu.
But he is a good man.	Ichaqa allin runam.
He didn't know what to do.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.
I couldn’t say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta atirqanichu.
I really couldn’t tell.	Chiqaptaqa manam willayta atirqanichu.
But he probably knows that.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa yachan.
No one knows what to do with him.	Manan pipas yachanchu paywan ima ruwananta.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan.
All right, all right.	Allinmi, allinmi.
I don't know what to do here.	Manam yachanichu kaypi imata ruwanaypaq.
It’s not like it’s not human.	Manan mana runa hinachu.
You knew that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam yacharqanki.
You can’t talk about it.	Manam chaymanta rimayta atiwaqchu.
It’s not the best.	Manam aswan allinchu.
Here is something else.	Kaypi huk imapas kachkan.
This one, in fact.	Kayqa, chiqaptaqa.
You always know it's there.	Sapa kutim yachanki chaypi kasqanmanta.
I hope it was the right thing to do.	Suyachkani allin ruway kasqanmanta.
It’s like last time.	Qayna kuti hinam.
I was sure of it.	Seguro karqani.
Someone has to do something.	Pipas imatapas ruwanan.
He’s better than what happened to me!.	¡Payqa aswan allinmi ñuqawan pasasqanmanta!.
That’s what he did.	Chaytan payqa ruwarqan.
Who can be a bad guy.	Pitaq mana allin ruwaq kanman.
Such a one.	Chayna huk.
Clearly a man.	Sut’inmi huk runa.
He was pretty sure of that.	Payqa allintan chaymanta seguro kasharqan.
I didn’t really want anything.	Manam imamantapas anchatachu munarqani.
I thought there was no one.	Mana pipas kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Not sure how it is.	Mana segurochu kani imaynatachus chayta.
That’s a thing now.	Chayqa kunanqa imapas.
It’s never been.	Manam haykapipas.
You really do it.	Chiqaptam ruwanki.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
Now this is very good.	Kunanqa kayqa ancha allinmi.
He is truly happy.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kusisqa kashan.
It’s hard to say if it’s a good thing.	Sasa niyta sichus allin kanman chayta.
I want everything.	Tukuy imatam munani.
It’s not bad or good.	Manam mana allinchu nitaq allinchu.
I know you can do this.	Yachanim kayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
It wasn’t like in the city.	Manam llaqtapi hinachu karqa.
He couldn’t do anything about it.	Payqa manan imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
Everything else.	Tukuy ima.
He says yes to it.	Payqa arí nin.
He didn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
This is all good.	Kayqa tukuy allinmi.
Which is the least.	Imataq aswan pisi kaq.
But he refused to speak.	Ichaqa manan rimayta munarqanchu.
That looks pretty interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
There is no wrongdoing.	Manam mana allin ruwayqa kanchu.
Nothing was right.	Manam imapas allinchu karqa.
Maybe you can’t.	Ichapas mana atiwaqchu.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
He is very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
You’re not always like that.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna kanki.
There is a man there.	Huk runam chaypi kachkan.
I didn’t see it coming.	Manam hamunanta rikurqanichu.
But it’s very interesting.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi.
Everything is too fast and too much.	Tukuy imapas ancha utqaylla, llumpay.
He could never have had that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa atinmanchu karqan.
I can’t believe it either.	Ñuqapas manam creeyta atinichu.
This is not going to be easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu kanqa.
A couple, now and then that’s it.	Huk iskay, kunan chaymanta chaylla.
I’m glad he’s nice to her.	Kusikuni paywan sumaq kasqanmanta.
It didn’t go well.	Manam allintachu rirqa.
He realized he wasn’t alone.	Payqa repararqanmi mana sapallanchu kashasqanmanta.
If you know how to.	Sichus yachanki imaynatachus chayta.
That was the worst part.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
It doesn’t make anything better.	Manam imatapas aswan allintachu ruwan.
He was a little worried.	Payqa huk chhikantan llakisqa kasharqan.
There really isn’t.	Chiqaptaqa manam kanchu.
I want to talk to you.	Rimayta munani.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
They are both of them.	Iskayninkum kanku.
I will never be happier or happier.	Manam haykapipas aswan kusisqachu nitaq aswan kusisqachu kasaq.
I don’t want to know.	Manam yachayta munanichu.
Something was wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kasqa.
I hope he was happy.	Suyachkani kusisqa kasqanmanta.
Both are really good.	Iskayninkum chiqap allin kanku.
You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
He wanted to know where she was.	Payqa maypi kasqanmanta yachayta munarqa.
But it doesn’t work out.	Ichaqa manan allintachu ruwan.
This seems very good.	Kayqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.
The best thing for you.	Aswan allin kaq qampaq.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu kanman.
That may not be a bad thing.	Chayqa manapaschá mana allinchu kanman.
I’m sorry about this.	Kaymanta llakikuni.
Actually, it’s pretty good.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha allin.
He probably did just that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqan.
I really don’t know.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu.
If you think about it, that’s fine.	Sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa, allinmi.
Maybe it would be good.	Ichapas allin kanman.
One day everything would be better.	Huk punchawmi tukuy imapas aswan allin kanman.
Great performance indeed.	Hatun ruway chiqap.
Which is great.	Imataq hatun.
He acted like a really nice guy.	Payqa chiqaptam sumaq runa hina ruwarqa.
But it is not an easy task.	Ichaqa manan facilchu chay ruwayqa.
It looked like a lot of one like that.	Chayqa rikchakurqa achka huk chayna.
This was a great experience.	Kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Very early, obviously.	Ancha temprano, sut’inmi.
But it was like yesterday.	Ichaqa qayna punchaw hinam karqa.
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
It’s not very good.	Mana ancha allinchu.
Clearly not.'	Sut’inmi mana’, nispa.
He seemed fine.	Payqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
Everyday thing, this.	Sapa punchaw imapas, kay.
But it certainly looks nice.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sumaq rikch’akun.
Maybe more than one.	Ichapas hukmanta aswan achka.
He was a nice guy.	Payqa sumaq runam karqa.
I know exactly what he did.	Allintam yachani ima ruwasqanmanta.
Nothing could be simpler.	Manan imapas aswan facilchu kanman.
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
You didn’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yacharqankichu.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
I don't think it's a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu kasqanmantam piensani.
Hopefully you can go.	Munaymanmi riyta atisqaykita.
That’s something he never thought about.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas yuyaykurqanchu.
I think that was the right thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
However, they are human beings.	Ichaqa, paykunaqa runan kanku.
I’ve done this.	Kaytaqa ruwarqani.
Do it better, faster, and better .	Aswan allinta, aswan utqaylla, aswan allinta ruway .
I'm not sure there's anything else.	Manam segurochu kani huk imapas kasqanmanta.
Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi.
You don’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yachankichu.
No, that wasn’t a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
Everything is nice and went well.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi, allintam rirqa.
But probably not much longer.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana aswan unaytachu.
He was very unhappy.	Payqa ancha mana kusisqachu kasqa.
I mean this is what I mean.	Kayta niyta munani.
It’s good to be here.	Allinmi kaypi kayqa.
He is always in town.	Sapa kutim llaqtapi kachkan.
I know it is true.	Yachanim chiqap kasqanmanta.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
But maybe it’s something.	Ichaqa ichapas imapas kanman.
But it is not certain.	Ichaqa manan segurochu.
He is not here.	Payqa manam kaypichu kachkan.
He needs to be here.	Payqa kaypi kananta necesitan.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
That means now.	Chayqa kunan niyta munan.
Everything seems fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakun.
He wasn't really sure why.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu seguro kasharqan imarayku chayta.
This process was very uncomfortable.	Kay ruwayqa ancha mana allinchu karqa.
Can you do it for yourself.	¿Atiwaqchu qampaq.
Almost every day.	Yaqa sapa punchaw.
But it could be worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
That went well enough.	Chayqa allintam rirqa.
I didn’t think of that.	Manam chaytaqa yuyaykurqanichu.
This is how it was supposed to be.	Kay hinam kanan karqa.
He is a human being.	Payqa runam.
I can't say yes now.	Kunanqa manam arí niyta atiymanchu.
I am a single person person.	Ñuqaqa sapallan runa runam kani.
He certainly didn’t want to be.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana chay hina kayta munarqanchu.
He knows it well enough.	Payqa allintam yachan.
But his name was there.	Ichaqa sutinmi chaypi kasqa.
Every day is something new.	Sapa punchawmi imapas musuq kaq.
It’s certainly better together.	Cheqaqtapunin aswan allin kuska.
Maybe you want to make sure from me that everything is fine.	Ichapas ñuqamanta seguro kayta munanki, tukuy imapas allin kasqanmanta.
Not sure what this is about.	Mana segurochu imamanta kayqa.
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
I want to talk to him.	Paywan rimayta munani.
There was one man, however.	Huk runan ichaqa karqan.
You are as good as anyone.	Pipas hina allinmi kanki.
It was never easy.	Manam haykapipas facilchu karqa.
More, now, more.	Aswan, kunan, aswan.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
This one seems rather interesting.	Kayqa aswan sumaqmi rikchakun.
Something, like, that.	Imapas, hina, chay.
Everything he didn’t do.	Tukuy ima mana ruwasqanmanta.
But he had to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanan karqan.
That wasn’t the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Do your best to do it.	Tukuy atisqaykita ruway.
Maybe it was more than one.	Ichapas hukmanta aswan achka karqa.
It’s not anymore.	Manañam.
He wanted more.	Payqa aswan achkatam munarqa.
I don’t want to be here anymore.	Manañam kaypi kayta munanichu.

I wasn’t so sure.	Manam chayna segurochu karqani.
This was too bad.	Kayqa llumpay mana allinmi karqa.
That was supposed to be.	Chayqa kanan karqan.
But obviously this is wrong.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kayqa mana allinchu.
Two weeks alone.	Iskay semana sapallan.
But of course he was.	Ichaqa sut’inmi payqa karqan.
What do you mean by that.	Ima niyta munanki.
However, he did not elaborate on his plans.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu willarqan chay yuyaykusqanmanta.

It’s never a bad thing.	Manam haykapipas mana allinchu.
It’s all good, though.	Tukuy imapas allinmi, ichaqa.

But here, no, not really.	Ichaqa kaypi, manan, manan cheqaqtachu.

He doesn’t know how to do it.	Payqa manan yachanchu imayna ruwananta.

No, it wasn’t anyone.	Manan, pipas karqan.
He knew it was the best.	Payqa yacharqanmi aswan allin kasqanmanta.

I was happy at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa kusisqam karqani.

About three weeks.	Yaqa kimsa semana.
He wasn’t a good guy.	Payqa manam allinchu karqa.
He had to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan karqan.

He is like three.	Payqa kimsa hinam kachkan.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.

No one could do it.	Manan pipas atirqanchu.
I couldn’t do anything about it.	Manam imatapas ruwayta atirqanichu.

This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
Not better, not worse.	Mana aswan allinchu, mana aswan mana allinchu.
He didn’t know where he was.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.

It’s not a good thing to do.	Mana allinchu imatapas ruwayqa.

Everything is beautiful.	Tukuy imapas sumaq sumaqmi.
He said he didn't think so.	Payqa nirqam mana chayna piensasqanmanta.

He couldn’t speak.	Payqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
It doesn’t always have to be that way.	Manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanan.
He is a beautiful man.	Payqa sumaq runam.
He knew what he was going to do.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwananta.
But I can’t do it.	Ichaqa manan atiymanchu.
He would have to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ruwanan kanman karqan.

What’s wrong with me? 	¿Imataq ñuqawan kachkan?
He realized what it was.	Payqa repararqanmi imachus kasqanmanta.
I’ve always wanted to go.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi riyta munarqani.
I know that for sure.	Chaytaqa allintam yachani.
Otherwise, maybe not so much.	Mana chayqa, ichapas mana anchatachu.
No no no no no.	Mana mana mana mana mana.
He wanted it yesterday.	Payqa qayna punchawmi munarqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
It wasn’t bad, actually.	Manam mana allinchu karqa, chiqaptaqa.
It was a little uncomfortable.	Huk chikan mana allinchu karqa.
You are here today.	Kunan punchawmi kaypi kachkanki.
Everything seemed fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa.
It wasn’t really like that.	Manam chiqaptachu chayna karqa.
I can’t do it right.	Manam allinta ruwayta atiymanchu.
But he refused to do so.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu.
I really don’t want to be.	Chiqaptaqa manam kayta munanichu.
This thing is pretty hard.	Kay imapas ancha sinchi.
In fact, it says much more than that.	Chiqaptaqa, chaymanta aswan achkatam nin.
It can be very lonely.	Ancha sapallanmi kanman.
That wasn’t the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Me too.	Ñuqapas.
That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
He knows it isn’t.	Payqa yachanmi mana chayna kasqanmanta.
He doesn’t always like it.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chayta gustan.
This should do what you want.	Kayqa munasqaykita ruwanan tiyan.
Tell me what.	Willay imata.
That may have played a role.	Chayqa yaqapaschá huk ruwayta ruwarqan.
For the sake of everything.	Tukuy ima allin kananpaq.
It probably wasn’t good enough.	Manapaschá allinchu karqan.
It certainly isn’t.	Cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu.
But if you want to do this it’s fine with me.	Ichaqa kayta ruwayta munanki chayqa allinmi ñuqawan.
That may not be a good thing.	Chayqa manapaschá allintachu kanman.
He was happy for a while.	Payqa huk tiempon kusisqa kasharqan.
You seem to be happy.	Kusisqa hinam kanki.
I did everything I could.	Tukuy imatam ruwarqani.
I’m sorry about all that.	Tukuy chaymanta llakikuni.
It’s going to be good.	Allinmi kanqa.
Nothing has to go wrong.	Manan imapas mana allinchu kanan.
That seemed unlikely.	Chayqa manapaschá hinachu karqan.
He wanted it very much.	Payqa anchatam munarqa.
To do this alone.	Kayta sapallan ruwananpaq.
What a beautiful day.	Ima sumaq punchawmi.
But, why is it? 	Ichaqa, ¿imarayku?
He knew nothing about it.	Payqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqanchu.
I think you can tell.	Yuyaykuni willayta atisqaykita.
That’s not an easy thing to do.	Chayqa manan facilchu ruwayqa.
I know a lot more about myself now.	Kunanqa aswan achkatam ñuqamanta yachani.
It couldn't have been easier.	Manam aswan facilchu kanman karqa.
He had to do the wrong thing.	Payqa chay mana allintam ruwanan karqa.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
That 's	Chayqa .
I couldn’t do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta atirqanichu.
This is not good for you.	Kayqa manam allinchu qampaq.
This would not be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman.
I just couldn’t do it to do it.	Chaylla mana ruwayta atirqanichu chayta ruwanaypaq.
I don't know exactly where it is.	Manam allintachu yachani maypi kasqanmanta.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
I'd be nice.	Sumaqmi kayman.
What will happen tomorrow.	Imataq paqarin kanqa.
He really seemed to want to help.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin yanapayta munanman hina karqan.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
If you weren’t happy enough.	Sichus mana allintachu kusisqa karqanki chayqa.
This seems to be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi rikchakun.
He was there all morning.	Payqa tukuy paqarinmi chaypi karqa.
He knows what’s going on.	Payqa yachanmi imakuna pasasqanmanta.
Which isn’t a bad thing.	Imataq mana mana allinchu.
Almost no one there, ever.	Yaqa mana pipas chaypi, hayk’aqpas.
I wouldn’t be able to go.	Manam riyta atiymanchu karqa.
If it’s too good to be true, probably.	Sichus ancha allin kanman chayqa, yaqapaschá.
They don’t care.	Paykunaqa manan imananpaschu.
I wonder why that is.	Tapukunitaqmi imarayku chayna kasqanmanta.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Ichaqa manan mana allinchu.
Do it quickly.	Utqaylla ruway.
I can’t be this.	Manam kayta atiymanchu.
No, that’s a good thing.	Manan, chayqa allinmi.
I'm not sure.	Manam segurochu kani.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I hadn’t thought of that.	Chaytaqa manan yuyaykurqanichu.
I want it to be beautiful.	Munani sumaq kananta.
He seems very happy though.	Payqa ancha kusisqam rikchakun ichaqa.
Now he wasn't so sure.	Kunanqa manañam chayna segurochu karqa.
He used to be a good guy.	Ñawpaqtaqa allin runam karqa.
It can't work.	Mana llamk'ayta atinchu.
I am not like that now.	Kunanqa manan chay hinachu kani.
I know he knows.	Yachanim payqa yachasqanmanta.
It wasn’t always like that.	Manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I thought that was the case.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Very quickly like that.	Ancha utqaylla chayna hina.
He couldn't tell what it was.	Payqa manan yachayta atirqanchu imachus kasqanmanta.
She’s beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi.
Still not sure how that happened.	Hinallam mana segurochu imayna chay pasasqanmanta.
Maybe not, maybe yes.	Ichapas mana, ichapas arí.
It’s better here.	Aswan allinmi kaypi.
I’d rather not.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana.
I didn't think of that.	Chaytaqa manam piensarqanichu.
He didn’t think about anything.	Payqa manan imapipas yuyaykurqanchu.
He doesn’t care about that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa imananpaschu.
But it is not the	Ichaqa manan chay .
Someone else did this.	Huk runam kayta ruwarqa.
No one else could have done that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa atinmanchu karqan.
This can often be difficult.	Chay ruwayqa sapa kutim sasa kanman.
It’s that beautiful.	Chayna sumaqmi.
Not like today.	Mana kunan punchaw hinachu.
He looked worried.	Payqa llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
He is a .	Payqa huk .
But, he doesn’t know that.	Ichaqa, manan chaytaqa yachanchu.
He had to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
No, nothing like that.	Manan, manan imapas chay hinachu.
He’s not the same as he used to be.	Payqa manan ñawpaq hinachu.
Everything was fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I was with him every day.	Sapa punchawmi paywan karqani.
That’s what it means.	Chayqa niyta munan.
You’re going to do it.	Qamqa ruwanki.
This will be a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi kanqa.
He is doing very well.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwachkan.
It’s a good morning.	Allintam paqarin.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas manam allinchu.
I want to tell you.	Willayta munani.
It’s probably there.	Yaqapaschá chaypi kachkan.
Now he wasn't so sure.	Kunanqa manañam chayna segurochu karqa.
I'm still hoping it doesn't happen at all.	Hinallam suyachkani mana imapipas pasananta.
I thought he might be.	Yuyarqanim payqa kanman nispa.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
This is never a good thing.	Kayqa manam haykapipas allinchu.
It means bigger money.	Astawan hatun qullqita niyta munan.
Maybe too much.	Ichapas llumpayta.
He looks great now.	Payqa kunanqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.
I thought maybe it would be good.	Yuyarqanim ichapas allin kanman nispa.
Great great beautiful.	Hatun hatun sumaq.
A lot, actually.	Achka, chiqaptaqa.
Everyone is terrified.	Lliwmi mancharisqa kachkanku.
I can’t do that yet.	Manaraqmi chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
That was a long time ago now.	Chayqa unayñan karqan kunanqa.
But that was a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi karqan.
He's actually there now.	Payqa chiqaptaqa kunanmi chaypi kachkan.
It’s not the worst.	Manan aswan mana allinchu.
I'm so sorry.	Anchatam llakikuni.
I think you can do better.	Aswan allinta ruwayta atisqaykita yuyaykuni.
But they are not like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanku.
For example,   .	Kay hina, .
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
If only there had been.	Sichus kanman karqan chayqa.
It’s like last week.	Qayna semana hinam.
He’s a good guy.	Payqa allinmi.
I didn’t know about anything.	Manam imamantapas yacharqanichu.
It’s not right for you.	Manam qampaq hinachu.
Maybe that’s what he meant.	Ichapas chayta niyta munarqa.
That was a good thing now.	Chayqa kunanqa allinmi karqa.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
He knows there aren't that many.	Payqa yachanmi mana chayna achka kasqanmanta.
He knew what was coming.	Payqa yacharqanmi imakuna hamunanta.
It’s not like someone who hasn’t been hurt.	Manan mana k’irisqa runa hinachu.
It seemed to do it.	Chayqa ruwaq hinam karqa.
But I don't know what to do.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imata ruwanayta.
He wanted to know where she was.	Maypi kasqanmanta yachayta munarqa.
It means something.	Imatapas niyta munan.
I thought maybe there was more to you.	Yuyarqanim ichapas aswan achka qampaq kanman nispa.
I’m not really worried.	Manam chiqaptachu llakikuni.
He realized he wanted to.	Payqa repararqanmi munasqanmanta.
Otherwise, everything is fine.	Mana chayqa, tukuy imapas allinmi.
He is very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
No one ever refused to play with me.	Manan pipas hayk’aqpas mana munarqanchu ñoqawan pukllayta.
You are such a wonderful person.	Chayna sumaq runam kanki.
Something is very wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas ancha mana allinmi.
He wasn’t happy.	Payqa manan kusisqachu karqan.
That it is good.	Allin kasqanmanta.
. . . .	.
It’s a difficult thing to do.	Sasa ruway.
He is doing very well.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwachkan.
Yeah, that’s good.	Arí, chay allin.
Maybe he was too tired.	Ichapas payqa llumpayta sayk’usqa karqa.
No, that wouldn’t be right.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
He knows what he wants.	Payqa yachanmi ima munasqanmanta.
That's his real name.	Chayqa chiqap sutinmi.
Everything would be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanman.
It doesn’t have to be right or wrong.	Manan allinchu nitaq mana allinchu kanan.
He wants to know.	Yachayta munan.
I’ll probably do it.	Yaqapaschá ruwasaq.
But no one knows.	Ichaqa manan pipas yachanchu.
Perhaps he can do that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa atinman.
It’s okay, though.	Allinmi, ichaqa.
No, it’s never been.	Manan, manan hayk’aqpas.
I don’t really want to.	Manam anchatachu munani.
That would continue to be the case.	Chayqa hinallam kanman.
That’s not a .	Chayqa manan huk .
I'll be fine with you.	Allintam qamwan kasaq.
I knew it would be so good.	Yacharqanim chayna allin kananta.
Maybe it would be good.	Ichapas allin kanman.
But this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna.
Not much good about it.	Mana ancha allinchu chaymanta.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
Sometimes more.	Wakin kuti aswan.
He had to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
Tomorrow will be bad.	Paqarinmi mana allin kanqa.
. . . .	.
He seemed devastated.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa hinan karqan.
More here, here, and here.	Astawan kaypi, kaypi, kaypi ima.
He thought he would be happy.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi kusisqa kananta.
In fact, it’s.	Chiqaptaqa.
I am well aware that it is so important.	Allintam yachani chayna ancha allin kasqanmanta.
Everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
I couldn't say how many.	Manam niyta atirqanichu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
He doesn't want to be there.	Payqa manam chaypi kayta munanchu.
He does that here, he said.	Chaytaqa kaypi ruwan, nispa.
He was better than good.	Payqa aswan allinmi karqan allin kasqanmantaqa.
It doesn’t mean anything.	Manam ima niyta munanchu.
Maybe it would be good.	Ichapas allin kanman.
I wasn’t so sure.	Manam chayna segurochu karqani.
That’s a .	Chayqa huk .
Here it says.	Kaypiqa ninmi.
I hope something comes of that.	Suyachkani chaymanta imapas hamunanta.
But it could have been.	Ichaqa chayna kanman karqa.
I think that is true.	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.
I can’t do anything right.	Manam imatapas allinta ruwayta atiymanchu.
I’d rather never do it again, ever.	Aswan allinmi kanman manaña hayk’aqpas ruwaymanchu, hayk’aqpas.
Someone else did it.	Huk runam chayta ruwarqa.
That’s not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanqa.
I thought you would.	Yuyarqanim chayta ruwanaykipaq.
She could tell he was nervous.	Payqa repararqanmi mancharisqa kashasqanmanta.
Someone else is doing better.	Huk runam aswan allinta ruwachkan.
But when, however, is uncertain.	Ichaqa hayk’aqmi ichaqa mana segurochu.
But he doesn't know anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas yachanchu.
It didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu karqa.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
I want to do it again.	Hukmanta ruwayta munani.
This is all.	Kay tukuy.
I didn’t know he could do that.	Manam yacharqanichu chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
You’ll have to do better.	Aswan allin ruwanayki kanqa.
You knew something was wrong there.	Chaypi imapas mana allin kasqanmantam yacharqanki.
He wants to do this.	Payqa kayta ruwayta munan.
You will certainly do it.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwanki.
I wish it was a simpler task.	Munaymanmi aswan sasa ruway kayta.
He doesn't know anything.	Mana imatapas mana yachanchu.
It doesn’t look like anything should happen.	Manan imapas kanan hinachu rikch’akun.
Everything had to be perfect.	Tukuy imapas allintam kanan karqa.
The best part of it.	Aswan allin kaq.
But maybe it’s something.	Ichaqa ichapas imapas kanman.
If you are, finish.	Sichus kanki chayqa, tukuy.
I didn’t know what it was.	Mana yacharqanichu ima kasqanmanta.
Otherwise, it seems fine.	Mana chayqa, allinmi rikchakun.
I'm still not quite sure what that is all about.	Kunankamapas manam allintachu yachani imamanta chay kasqanmanta.
Otherwise, it’s fine.	Mana chayqa allinmi.
He seems to be fine.	Payqa allinmi rikchakun.
But he knew he would.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwananta.
He thought he probably would.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi yaqapaschá chayta ruwananta.
I'm not sure anymore.	Manañam segurochu kani.
Very good, very good.	Ancha allin, ancha allin.
I mean really big.	Chiqap hatun niyta munani.
What a man.	Ima runa.
You never know what might happen.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu imakuna pasananta.
I can’t say it.	Manam niyta atiymanchu.
The right thing to do.	Allin kaq.
I didn’t want to know more either.	Ñuqapas manam astawan yachayta munarqanichu.
Maybe it was the case.	Ichapas chayna karqa.
For what he did.	Chay ruwasqanmanta.
They are indeed.	Cheqaqtapunin kanku.
Anything would do it.	Imapas ruwanman.
It didn’t look bad.	Manam mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
I wish I could have.	Munaymanmi karqan chayta.
I hope you do well.	Suyachkani allinta ruwanaykipaq.
Yes, of course he did.	Arí, sut’inmi chayta ruwarqan.
It could have been better.	Aswan allinmi kanman karqan.
That’s a good thing for you.	Chayqa allinmi qampaq.
He didn’t want to come.	Payqa manan hamuyta munarqanchu.
I couldn’t tell.	Manam willayta atirqanichu.
You can’t, obviously.	Manan atiwaqchu, sut’inmi.
He doesn’t want to.	Payqa manam munanchu.
I don't think so.	Manam chaytaqa piensanichu.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I really wanted to know.	Cheqaqtapunin yachayta munarqani.
I'm not sure that's the case.	Manam segurochu kani chayna kasqanmantaqa.
But they are still unhappy.	Ichaqa hinallam mana kusisqachu kachkanku.
You know everything is going to be okay.	Yachanki tukuy imapas allin kananta.
First, what’s wrong with it.	Ñawpaqtaqa, ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I am so happy for you.	Anchatam kusikuni qampaq.
I mean, like good.	Niyta munani, allin hina.
It’s good, though.	Allinmi ichaqa.
Otherwise, it’s probably not.	Mana chayqa, manachá.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
He knew what he was going to do.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwananta.
But that is not the case now.	Ichaqa kunanqa manan chay hinachu.
Everything went wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allintachu rirqa.
I think he was very scared.	Yuyaykuni ancha mancharisqa kasqanmanta.
Not sure what it is though.	Mana segurochu ima kasqanmanta ichaqa.
They are always there for you.	Paykunaqa sapa kutim qampaq kachkan.
I'm sure.	Seguro kani.
But he kept going.	Ichaqa hinallam rirqa.
You can’t do it.	Manan atiwaqchu.
But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.
I hope things work out for you.	Suyachkani imapas allin kananpaq qampaq.
It would be like that.	Chayna kanman.
Yes you do.	Arí qamqa ruwanki.
I hope it will be soon.	Suyachkani chaylla kananta.

I’m a more current person.	Aswan kunan runa kani.
About a year.	Yaqa huk wata.
I told her everything would be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa nispaymi nirqani.
He wanted to talk.	Payqa rimayta munarqa.
I'll do something, please.	Imatapas ruwasaq, ama hina kaspa.
I can’t even afford it.	Manam nitaq atiymanchu.
I know it is not easy.	Yachanim mana facilchu kasqanmanta.
That was fine, after all.	Chayqa allinmi karqa, tukuy imamanta.
For example.	Kay hina.
It has always been important.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi ancha allin karqa.
If, if, if .	Sichus, sichus, sichus .
It is indeed so.	Cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I’ve never seen it before.	Manam haykapipas rikurqanichu.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa.
Perhaps that was the case.	Yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
That doesn’t always work.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu allinta ruwan.
It seems every day.	Sapa punchawmi rikchakun.
It may not be a good idea.	Manapaschá allinchu kanman.
I hope it is.	Suyachkani chayna kasqanmanta.
Very bad for you.	Ancha mana allinmi qampaq.
Yeah, he’s really, really good.	Arí, payqa chiqap, chiqap allinmi.
Here’s the big one.	Kaypi hatun kaq.
A really good guy.	Chiqap allin runa.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
He seemed angry.	Payqa phiñasqa hinam karqa.
What's with you.	Imataq qamwan kachkan.
I know he will do it.	Yachanim chayta ruwananta.
I mean, it has to be real, that’s all.	Niyta munani, chiqap kanan, chaylla.
If that’s not good enough.	Chay mana allinchu kanman chayqa.
A truly lonely man.	Chiqap sapallan runa.
He didn’t want to do it.	Mana ruwayta munarqanchu.
He does it all the time.	Sapa kutim chayta ruwan.
This approach fails.	Kay ruwayqa mana allintachu ruwan.
I thought it was pretty cool.	Ñuqaqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
He is not .	Payqa manan .
I don't care what it looks like.	Manam imananpaschu imayna kasqanmantaqa.
Okay, that was a good thing.	Allinmi, chayqa allinmi karqa.
He seemed so sure.	Payqa ancha seguro hinam karqa.
I'm afraid there may be more than that.	Manchakuni aswan achka kanman chaymanta.
Maybe like always.	Ichapas sapa kuti hina.
No one knows what it is.	Manan pipas yachanchu.
He seems to be fine.	Payqa allinmi rikchakun.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
Now he probably knows.	Kunanqa yaqapaschá yachan.
That’s right, maybe not.	Chayqa allinmi, manapaschá.
Perhaps they are.	Ichapas chayna kanku.
It’s there all the time.	Tukuy tiempon chaypi kashan.
No, things are fine.	Manan, imapas allinmi.
That's good .	Chayqa, allinmi .
That’s the best thing.	Chayqa aswan allinmi.
But this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna.
I am very happy about this.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani kaymanta.
They are not what they are now.	Paykunaqa manan kunan hinachu kanku.
Every day is like a year.	Sapa punchawmi huk wata hina.
He wasn’t really there.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chaypi kasharqan.
This doesn't seem right.	Kayqa manam allinchu rikchakun.
But it certainly isn’t.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana.
Today was a very good day.	Kunan punchawqa ancha allin punchawmi karqa.
But it was beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi karqa.
Shouldn’t you do that.	Manachu chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
Maybe one day it will be that good.	Ichapas huk punchaw chayna allin kanman.
It was a great day.	Chayqa hatun punchawmi karqa.
Something was here.	Imapas kaypi karqa.
Do whatever you want with him.	Paywan ima munasqaykita ruway.
Very fast indeed.	Ancha utqaylla chiqap.
I can’t say yet.	Manaraqmi niyta atiymanchu.
I want to win.	Ñuqaqa atipayta munani.
. . . .	.
. . . .	.
It means a lot.	Anchatam niyta munan.
Now this does not exist.	Kunanqa kayqa manam kanchu.
I mean for sure.	Seguro niyta munani.
Now he will do that.	Kunanqa chaytan ruwanqa.
Alone, always alone.	Sapallan, sapa kuti sapallan.
That’s a good thing, actually.	Chayqa allinmi, chiqaptaqa.
We always pretended you were with us.	Sapa kutim ñuqaykuwan kasqaykita hina ruwaq kayku.
This was something.	Kayqa imapas karqa.
He's doing well now.	Payqa kunanqa allintam kachkan.
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
It's safer.	Aswan segurom.
You’re going to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwanki.
I did it right.	Allintam ruwarqani.
. . . .	.
It doesn’t mean that.	Manan chayta niyta munanchu.
But this is still the case.	Ichaqa kayqa hinallam kachkan.
Which was to say, angry.	Imataq niyta karqa, phiñasqa.
He certainly doesn’t.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana.
That is not a good thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa manam allinchu.
In fact, they are.	Chiqaptaqa, paykunaqa kanku.
You know a lot of things.	Achkatam yachanki.
It’s not very good.	Mana ancha allinchu.
Maybe it was the case.	Ichapas chayna karqa.
That was obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi karqan.
He had to do something.	Payqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
But now it was, like last night.	Ichaqa kunanmi chayna karqa, qayna tuta hina.
I’m a human being.	Ñuqaqa runam kani.
I want to do more and more.	Astawan astawan ruwayta munani.
It was actually quite nice.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He was hurt and angry.	Payqa k’irisqa, phiñasqa ima kasharqan.
He knows you are here.	Payqa yachanmi kaypi kasqaykita.
He didn’t really do anything.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu imatapas ruwarqan.
No, of course not.	Manan, sut’inmi mana.
I thought he might be alone.	Yuyarqanim sapallan kanman nispa.

However, this would not be the safest.	Ichaqa manan kayqa aswan segurochu kanman.
He knew that it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayna kasqanmanta.
This can be unsafe.	Kayqa mana segurochu kanman.
It’s been like that for a long time.	Unayñan chay hina kashan.
It was a lonely one.	Chayqa sapallanmi karqa.
That was probably the case at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa yaqapaschá chayna karqa.

That was really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi karqa.
That is the best way to do it.	Chay ruwayqa aswan allinmi.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
This isn’t the first time.	Kayqa manan ñawpaq kutichu.
Always alone.	Sapa kuti sapallayki.
Something beautiful, something good.	Imapas sumaq, imapas allin.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
That will be the best.	Chayqa aswan allinmi kanqa.
Do a great job.	Hatun llamkayta ruway.
He wasn’t always there.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu karqan.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
I'm still waiting.	Hinallam suyachkani.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
Actually he was happy.	Chiqaptaqa payqa kusisqam karqa.
It was a bad thing.	Mana allinmi karqa.
But it really is.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
That’s the name of it.	Chayqa sutinmi.
It certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwan.
And he said, 'It's.	Hinan payqa nisqa.
Everything remains the same.	Tukuy imapas hinallam kachkan.
But things are not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu imapas.
I don't know what to make of this.	Manam yachanichu kaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
I don’t know how to do this.	Manam yachanichu kayta ruwayta.
It was supposed to be a good day.	Allin punchawmi kanan karqa.
It wasn’t good to be here.	Mana allinchu karqa kaypi kayqa.
Actually, not quite.	Chiqaptaqa, manam allintachu.
It’s good for you.	Allinmi qampaq.
The third step was more interesting.	Kimsa kaq ruwayqa aswan sumaqmi karqa.
But nothing about it seems right.	Ichaqa manan imapas chaymantaqa allinchu rikch’akun.
First of all, it doesn’t matter.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan imananpaschu.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
If anything seemed upset.	Sichus imapas phiñasqa hina karqan.
I hope there is nothing from this.	Suyachkani kaymanta mana imapas kananpaq.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
That you are here with me.	Kaypi ñuqawan kasqaykita.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
A weekly routine is important.	Sapa semana ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
But I don’t think he could do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu, nispaymi yuyaykuni.
But he knew how to do it.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi imayna ruwananta.
This is a wonderful man.	Kayqa huk sumaq runam.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa.
You can’t say it anymore.	Manañam niyta atiwaqchu.
Anyone, that’s all.	Pipas, chaylla.
At first nothing was right.	Ñawpaqtaqa manan imapas allinchu karqan.
No, he wasn't sure he liked that better.	Manan, manan segurochu karqan chayta aswan gustasqanmanta.
I really don't know what to make of this.	Chiqaptaqa manam yachanichu kaymanta imata ruwanaypaq.
That he wanted better.	Aswan allinta munasqanmanta.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
Now you are a different person.	Kunanqa huk runam kanki.
If you want to know what that thing is.	Sichus yachayta munanki imachus chay imapas kasqanmanta.
You know that it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam yachanki.
That’s always the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim chayna.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqan.
Of course, he probably would.	Arí, yaqapaschá chaytaqa munanman.
That’s another though.	Chayqa huk ichaqa.
I’m afraid it’s going to happen.	Manchakuni chayna kananta.
That was a little uncomfortable.	Chayqa huk chikan mana allinchu karqa.
That’s right, yes.	Chayqa arí.
It wasn’t what he said it would be.	Manam nisqanman hinachu karqa.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
To be non-existent.	Mana kananpaq.
I could never have done that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwayta atiymanchu karqa.
It wasn’t all that good.	Manam tukuy chay allinchu karqa.
It would be better.	Aswan allinmi kanman.
If you think it would be good.	Sichus yuyanki chayqa allinmi kanman.
Everything is good here.	Kaypiqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
I mean, he still is.	Niyta munani, payqa hinallam kachkan.
I didn’t know it.	Manam yacharqanichu.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
It was his greatest moment.	Chayqa karqan aswan hatun tiempon.
Today with me.	Kunan punchaw ñuqawan.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
He was the guy.	Payqa chay runam karqa.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
What kind of person.	Imayna runa.
Now I have serious doubts about this.	Kunanqa anchatam iskayrayani kaymanta.
That’s really nice of me.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi ñuqamanta.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
Maybe he did that.	Ichapas chayta ruwarqa.
That’s always the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim chayna.
He will certainly be tired here.	Cheqaqtapunin kaypi sayk’usqa kanqa.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
That might not be such a bad thing.	Chayqa manapaschá chhayna mana allinchu kanman.
One day and one night and one day.	Huk punchaw huk tuta huk punchaw.
It wasn't that easy.	Manam chayna facilchu karqa.
Would this be a good idea.	Allinchu kanman kayqa.
That’s what I thought.	Chaytan yuyaykurqani.
Not really, he said that yesterday.	Mana chiqaptachu, qayna punchawmi chayta nirqa.
That was a period of time.	Chayqa huk tiempon karqan.
I really wanted to go.	Anchatam riyta munarqani.
Two or three.	Iskay kimsa.
I’m sure that would have been better.	Seguro kani chay ruwayqa aswan allin kanman karqan.
Maybe it’s just that.	Ichapas chaylla kanman.
I want to tell you why.	Willayta munani imarayku chayta.
I didn’t want to do it.	Manam ruwayta munarqanichu.
He was always like that.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna karqa.
We are, together.	Kanchik, kuska.
I'm not sure.	Manam segurochu kani.
Maybe he can’t.	Ichapas mana atinmanchu.
I don’t think it will do well.	Manam allintachu ruwananta yuyani.
This is not a bad thing.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu.
He was tired and angry.	Payqa sayk’usqa, phiñasqa ima kasqa.
He can’t be this.	Payqa manan kayta atinmanchu.
But, yes, that means a lot.	Ichaqa, arí, chay ruwayqa anchatam nin.
That worked out fine.	Chayqa allintam ruwarqa.
It’s not the case.	Manan chay hinachu kashan.
A week, maybe, every year.	Huk semana, ichapas, sapa wata.
That wasn’t the case.	Chayqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
It’s a very good day.	Ancha allin punchawmi.
Not very well, either.	Mana ancha allintachu, nitaq.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He’s more human than I am.	Payqa ñuqamanta aswan runa.
Now it’s worse.	Kunanqa aswan mana allinmi.
Performance was nothing bad.	Ruwayqa mana ima mana allinchu karqa.
Several times in fact.	Achka kuti chiqaptaqa.
I'll do it right.	Allinta ruwasaq.
Maybe it’s true.	Ichapas chiqap.
Everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
He didn’t know what was wrong.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imachus mana allin kashasqanmanta.
No one seemed right.	Manam pipas allinchu rikchakurqa.
Do it alone, you know.	Sapallan ruway, yachanki.
It’s always a process.	Sapa kutim huk ruway.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
Why did this happen?'	¿Imanasqataq kay karqa?’, nispa.
However, this is not a good practice.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa manam allinchu.
I think it’s a good thing to do.	Allinmi kanman chayta ruwayqa, nispan yuyaykuni.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
If anything he was a good man.	Sichus imapas allin runa karqan.
He doesn't want anything.	Payqa manam imatapas munanchu.
Don't know when you're actually there, either.	Ama yachankichu hayk'aqpas chiqap chaypi kasqaykita, nitaq.
He couldn’t tell her anything.	Payqa manan imatapas willayta atirqanchu.
Happy with me.	Kusisqa ñuqawan.
I knew you could.	Yacharqanim atisqaykita.
You never know what’s going to happen.	Manan hayk’aqpas yachankichu imachus pasananta.
Yes, according to another statement.	Arí, huk nisqanman hina.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
Maybe as many as ten.	Ichapas chunka hina.
This is somebody.	Kayqa wakin runam.
But he knew he didn't like it.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chayta mana gustasqanmanta.
That, as always, was great.	Chayqa, sapa kuti hina, ancha allinmi karqa.
But nothing worked out.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu karqan.
It’s no longer about anything.	Manañam imamantapas kanchu.
But he knew it would never be good.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi mana hayk’aqpas allin kananta.
But it was a bit difficult.	Ichaqa huk chhikantan sasa karqan.
No, and it doesn’t mean better.	Manan, nitaq aswan allin niyta munanchu.
He said he couldn’t do it.	Mana ruwayta atisqanmanta nisqa.
I have so much to do.	Anchatam ruwanay kachkan.
There was a third person.	Kimsa kaq runam karqa.
How was it going to be.	Imaynataq karqa.
It’s a good thing.	Allinmi kasqanmanta.
He wasn’t always like that.	Payqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I’m so, so worried.	Ñuqaqa chayna, ancha llakisqa kani.
You, man.	Qamqa, runa.
But that wasn’t the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu karqan.
It was no longer a good thing.	Manañam allinchu karqa.
I'm not sure, now.	Manam segurochu kani, kunanqa.
That is certainly the case.	Chayqa segurom kachkan.
It was like day and night.	Tuta punchaw hinam karqa.
It could have been something.	Imapas kanman karqa.
He is still there.	Payqa hinallam kachkan.
It was supposed to be yesterday.	Qayna punchawmi kanan karqa.
He said he wanted to come.	Hamuyta munan nispa.
That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do anything.	Chayqa manan niyta munanchu mana imatapas ruwanaykita.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
He didn’t really want that.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chaytaqa munarqan.
It’s not like that anymore.	Manañan chay hinachu.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
Does anyone know what that could have been.	¿Pipas yachanchu imachus chay kanman karqan chayta.
But I don’t know how to say it.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imayna niyta.
After all, they’re human.	Tukuy imamanta, paykunaqa runa kanku.
He doesn’t care about that anymore.	Chaytaqa manañan imananpaschu.
Otherwise, nothing means anything.	Mana chayqa, manam imapas imatapas niyta munanchu.
What was that that was.	Imataq chay karqa.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
It certainly would be.	Cheqaqtapunin chayna kanman.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
It does the job.	Chaytaqa ruwan.
Someone wanted to talk to him.	Pipas paywan rimayta munarqa.
Something he hasn’t done yet.	Imapas manaraq ruwasqanmanta.
Yeah, that’s for sure.	Arí, chayqa seguro.
Anything but what he had to do.	Imapas ichaqa ima ruwanan kasqanmanta.
In fact, there is nothing.	Chiqaptaqa manam imapas kanchu.
I thought that would be nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman nispaymi nirqani.
I’m all right.	Tukuy allinmi kani.
It was good but this was great.	Allinmi karqa ichaqa kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Everything seemed unreal.	Tukuy imapas mana chiqap hinam karqa.
It wasn’t like anything else.	Manan huk hinachu karqan.
I didn’t know what you were going to do.	Manam yacharqanichu imata ruwanaykita.
Forgive me, please.	Pampachaykuway, ama hina kaspa.
I mean very quickly.	Niyta munani ancha utqaylla.
You probably didn’t know that.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa mana yacharqankichu.
Now, that’s .	Kunanqa, chayqa .
They are really nice though.	Paykunaqa chiqap sumaqmi ichaqa.
Today with us always.	Kunan punchaw ñuqaykuwan sapa kuti.
I know that for sure.	Chaytaqa allintam yachani.
He had to do this tough.	Payqa kayta sinchitan ruwanan karqan.
The strong thing.	Sinchi kaq.
It was really great.	Chiqaptam ancha allin karqa.
Yes he is.	Arí payqa.
You probably know something about it.	Yaqapaschá chaymantaqa imatapas yachanki.
He didn't know what to do.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima ruwananta.
I didn't really think about it.	Chaytaqa manam allintachu piensarqani.
I didn’t want to talk about it.	Manam chaymantaqa rimayta munarqanichu.
Now it’s not really.	Kunanqa manan cheqaqtachu.
I want to say something.	Imatapas niyta munani.
It’s not, however.	Manam ichaqa.
Indeed, he was.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa karqan.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
But it won’t be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanqa.
He can be sure of that.	Payqa chaymanta seguro kanman.
I didn’t want to do that.	Manam chaynata ruwayta munarqanichu.
It shouldn’t be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan.
Someone was hurt.	Pipas k’irisqa karqan.
I want to tell you.	Willayta munani.
He’s pretty good.	Payqa allin allinmi.
But he doesn’t always do that.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chaytaqa ruwan.
That’s right for you.	Chayqa qampaq hinam.
That is still the case today.	Chayqa kunankamapas hinam kachkan.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
I hope this year won’t be the case.	Suyachkani kay wata mana chayna kananta.

It’s so good!.	¡Ancha allinmi!.

You know that very well.	Chaytaqa allintan yachanki.
I’m not that bad.	Manam chayna mana allinchu kani.
It’s not always the case.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna.
It wasn’t always like that.	Manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
I suspect now it may be.	Sospechani kunanqa ichapas chayna kasqanmanta.
No one to help him.	Mana pipas yanapananpaq.
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
How very great.	Imayna ancha hatun.
That was a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
That was the worst part.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
Then this year.	Chaymanta kay wata.
I know where he lives.	Yachanim maypi yachasqanmanta.
I mean to do that.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi niyta munani.
The event will take place tomorrow.	Chay ruwayqa paqarinmi kanqa.
Tomorrow is a great day.	Paqarin hatun punchaw.
If anyone can help, that would be great.	Pipas yanapayta atinman chayqa, ancha allinmi kanman.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allin runam karqa.
No one knows that.	Chaytaqa manam pipas yachanchu.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
I want this not to happen.	Kay mana kananta munani.
Everyone is very busy.	Lliwmi ancha ocupasqa kachkanku.
Yes, yes, yes.	Arí, arí, arí.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
Otherwise, it’s not.	Mana chayqa, manan.
It seems to be the case.	Chayna kanman hina.
I was very uncomfortable.	Ancha mana allinchu karqani.
No one knows exactly why.	Manam pipas allintachu yachan imanasqa kasqanmantaqa.
He desperately needs help.	Payqa anchatan necesitan yanapayta.
You know nothing about it.	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas yachankichu.
You weren’t really sure about it.	Manam chiqaptachu chaymanta seguro karqanki.
Everything was wonderful.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But it’s not like it is now.	Ichaqa manan kunan hinachu.
A little bit about it.	Huk chikan chaymanta.
He is very happy to do so.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan chayta ruwananpaq.
He did it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwarqa.
Nothing else about it.	Mana imapas chaymantaqa.
That is not the case at that time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu.
You don’t really think about it.	Manan anchatachu chaypi yuyaykunki.
But he can't do anything.	Ichaqa manan imatapas ruwayta atinchu.
This continued to be the case.	Kayqa hinallam karqa.
Someone lives there.	Chaypi pipas yachan.
I would never have done that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa ruwaymanchu karqa.
Some other person.	Wakin huk runa.
He had to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanan karqan.
First of all, everything if it’s better.	Ñawpaqtaqa, tukuy ima sichus aswan allin kanman chayqa.
This was the worst.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi karqa.
I don’t think it’s right.	Manam allintachu piensani.
That was supposed to be.	Chayqa kanan karqan.
But it’s a human being.	Ichaqa runam.
Maybe too well.	Ichapas ancha allinta.
He’s seriously injured.	Payqa sinchi k’irisqa kashan.

It’s a very bad thing.	Ancha mana allinmi.

I am not sure about that now.	Kunanqa manam chaymantaqa segurochu kani.
He couldn’t say that.	Payqa manan chayta niyta atirqanchu.

But he didn’t say it right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu nirqan.
Who knows what he’ll do tonight.	Pitaq yachan kunan tuta imakuna ruwananta.
I know he will, .	Yachanim chayna ruwananta, .
He knew it would be bad.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana allin kananta.

But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.

You were always alone here.	Kaypiqa sapa kutim sapallayki karqanki.
Now, you know that.	Kunanqa, chayta yachanki.

He was really happy.	Payqa chiqap kusisqam karqa.
I probably should do that.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanay.
Hopefully it will be a success.	Munaymanmi allin ruway kananpaq.
But things are not as they used to be.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu imapas kashan.

I’m glad, actually.	Kusikuni, chiqaptaqa.
He knew, but he didn't care.	Payqa yacharqanmi, ichaqa manan imananpaschu.

Then one day.	Chaymanta huk punchaw.
Everything is fine there for sure.	Tukuy imapas allinmi chaypi seguro.

But he had to do it.	Ichaqa chayta ruwanan karqan.
That’s the only thing.	Chaylla ima.
He did this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwarqa.
In fact, it probably could have been worse.	Chiqaptaqa ichapas aswan mana allin kanman karqa.
Well! 	Allin!
Not to anyone.	Mana pimanpas.
He had to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanan karqa.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.

But he knew that this was not the case.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chay ruwayqa mana hinachu kasqanmanta.
I suspect it won’t happen again this year.	Sospechani manaña kay wata hukmanta pasananta.
Not you and me.	Mana qamwan ñuqawanqa.

I want things to work out.	Munani imapas allin kananpaq.
This is for you.	Kayqa qampaq.
But he is not alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu.
He really wanted to be there.	Payqa anchatan munarqan chaypi kayta.
No, well, not alone.	Manan, allinmi, manan sapallanchu.
It doesn’t matter to anyone.	Manan pitapas imananpaschu.

Not sure what though.	Mana segurochu imamanta ichaqa.
But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.

He can't work.	Payqa manam llamkayta atinchu.
He cannot speak.	Payqa manan rimayta atinchu.
Then the third.	Chaymanta kimsa kaq.
You're beautiful, he said.	Sumaqmi kanki, nispa.
It's obviously not good enough.	Sut'inmi mana allinchu.
Why can’t it be easy.	¿Imanasqataq mana facilchu kanman.
Now I really want to know.	Kunanqa anchatam yachayta munani.
About three times.	Yaqa kimsa kuti.
Accordingly, he was married.	Chayman hinam payqa casarasqa karqa.
This was not an easy task.	Kayqa manam facilchu karqa.
He sensed something was going to happen.	Payqa repararqanmi imapas pasananta.
They are still there.	Paykunaqa hinallam kachkanku.

Both for sure, maybe three.	Iskayninku seguro, ichapas kimsa.
Very late, actually.	Ancha tarde, chiqaptaqa.
Have a nice day.	Qampaq allin punchaw.
But it was not easy at the time.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa manan facilchu karqan.
I don’t want to, after all.	Manam munanichu, tukuy imamanta.
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.
He was supposed to be like that.	Payqa chayna kanan karqa.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
He wanted to win this thing.	Payqa kay imatapas atipayta munarqan.
Almost, but no.	Yaqa, ichaqa manan.
You’ll think of this.	Kayta yuyanki.
He was totally uncomfortable.	Payqa tukuy imamanta mana allinchu kasqa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
It’s really important.	Chiqaptam ancha allin.
There is nothing here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas kanchu.
That would certainly do that.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwanman.
That meant he was here.	Chayqa kaypi kasqanmantam niyta munarqa.
You know exactly what you want.	Qamqa allintam yachanki ima munasqaykita.
Did you never know.	Manachu haykapipas yacharqankichu.

Something is better than nothing.	Imapas aswan allinmi mana imamantapas.
He still refuses to talk to her.	Kunankamapas manam munanchu paywan rimayta.
Yes, he seemed overwhelmed.	Arí, llumpay llakisqa hinam karqa.

Now it's like he's never been there.	Kunanqa mana hayk'aqpas chaypi kaq hinam.
I wanted to come here.	Kayman hamuyta munarqani.
He didn’t think about it.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu.

No, there is no time.	Manan, manan tiempo kanchu.
You know, this is a hard day.	Yachanki, kayqa sasa p’unchawmi.

But he is alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi kashan.
I just didn’t want to know.	Chaylla mana yachayta munarqanichu.
Yes, that’s a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi.
I don’t want to do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta munanichu.

Why is that the case?.	¿Imanasqataq chayna?.
But not much else.	Ichaqa manan anchatachu hukmanta.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
He was too good to be true.	Payqa llumpay allinmi karqa.
I have to do this.	Kayta ruwanay tiyan.
He didn’t think that would happen here.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu kaypiqa chhayna kananta.
I think he’s almost happy.	Yuyaykuni yaqa kusisqa kashasqanmanta.
I know that it is.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta.
But he knows that won’t happen.	Ichaqa yachanmi chay mana pasananta.
He was really angry.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin phiñasqa kasharqan.
But he was angry.	Ichaqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
I know almost nothing.	Yaqa mana imatapas yachanichu.
He doesn’t care about that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa imananpaschu.
It certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwan.
You learn to shop better.	Aswan allinta rantiyta yachanki.
Another great achievement.	Huk hatun ruway.
But it’s not a bad thing.	Ichaqa manan mana allinchu.
He seemed almost pleased.	Payqa yaqa kusisqam rikchakurqa.
If you’re not happy, we’re not happy.	Mana kusisqachu kanki chayqa, manan kusisqachu kayku.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
Nice, but not hugely great.	Sumaq, ichaqa mana hatun hatun.
All about it, everything about it.	Tukuy chaymanta, tukuy imapas chaymanta.
That’s what he told me.	Chaytan niwarqan.
He certainly should.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa ruwanan.
He’s not a nobody.	Payqa mana pipas.
It was a wonderful day.	Chay punchawqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
The process can take up to three days.	Chay ruwayqa kimsa punchawmi kanman.
I would like to.	Munaymanmi.
But, it had to be.	Ichaqa, kanan karqan.
He seems to be in shock.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam kachkan.
He was a little nervous.	Payqa huk chhikantan mancharisqa kasharqan.
You knew all along.	Tukuy tiempon yacharqanki.
I will continue to do so.	Hinallam chayta ruwasaq.
He does that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi ruwan.
I’m not a good guy.	Manam allinchu kani.
Indeed, it was.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina karqan.
He refused to help her.	Payqa manan yanapayta munarqanchu.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasqa.
That’s not the case though.	Chayqa manan ichaqa.
He’s alone though.	Payqa sapallanmi ichaqa.
You can’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atiwaqchu.
But no, not really.	Ichaqa manan, manan cheqaqtachu.
This is a unique one.	Kayqa sapallanmi.

The only one, you ever were.	Chay sapallan, hayk’aqllapas karqanki.
He knew there would be no future here.	Payqa yacharqanmi kaypi mana hamuq tiempo kananta.
It was never good enough.	Manam haykapipas allinchu karqa.
I don’t think he’ll do well there.	Manam chaypi allintachu ruwananta yuyani.
He had always wanted it too much.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi llumpayta munarqa.
I love to play the game.	Pukllayta anchata munani.
I did that last year.	Chaytaqa qayna wata ruwarqani.
You want it to be good.	Munanki allin kananta.
He could have done that yesterday.	Chaytaqa qayna punchawmi ruwanman karqa.
Yes, he is very happy.	Arí, payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
That was yesterday.	Chayqa qayna punchawmi.

This has to be yesterday.	Kayqa qayna punchawmi kanan.
Maybe it almost was.	Ichapas yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
It wasn’t the right fit.	Manam chayman hinachu karqa.
He was, for sure.	Payqa karqan, seguro.
That seemed to be the case.	Chayqa karqan hina.
I'll go more often.	Aswan sapa kutim risaq.
But he kept doing it.	Ichaqa hinallam chayta ruwarqa.
No one knew how to help.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imayna yanapayta.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
I don’t want to either.	Manam ñuqapas munanichu.
That has always been the case.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
He was very good to her.	Payqa ancha allintam paywan ruwarqa.
Not yet, however.	Manaraqmi ichaqa.
I didn’t want to do this.	Manam kayta ruwayta munarqanichu.
I had to do a lot of things.	Achkatam imatapas ruwanay karqa.
It's almost too good to be true.	Yaqa ancha allinmi chiqap kananpaq.
He always did that.	Payqa sapa kutim chayta ruwaq.
I feel better here.	Aswan allintam kaypi kachkani.
That was now.	Chayqa kunanmi karqan.
I’m glad he’s not here.	Kusikuni mana kaypi kasqanmanta.
No one could do everything perfectly.	Manan pipas tukuy imatapas allinta ruwayta atirqanchu.
Maybe he’s the one.	Ichapas payqa chayna kanman.
But this is worse.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan mana allinmi.
It was two weeks.	Iskay semanan karqan.
He knew how to do it right.	Payqa yacharqanmi allinta ruwayta.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
He can’t beat it.	Payqa manam atipayta atinchu.
He did it very well.	Chaytaqa ancha allintam ruwarqa.
Maybe that’s the right thing to do.	Ichapas chayna allin kanman.
But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
Next year maybe.	Hamuq wata ichapas.
That 's	Chayqa .
Yeah, that’s nice.	Arí, chayqa sumaqmi.
Almost like that.	Yaqa chayna.
It looked so bad.	Ancha mana allinmi rikchakurqa.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi karqa.
I'm sure it is.	Seguro kani chayna kasqanmanta.
Now he went on and on.	Kunanqa payqa hinallam rirqa.
I’m sure he’ll do well.	Seguro kani allinta ruwananmanta.
Can’t help with that.	Mana chaypi yanapayta atinchu.
I doubt it will happen.	Iskayrayani chayna kananta.
They’re not as, well, happy as they used to be.	Paykunaqa manan ñawpaq hinachu, allinmi, kusisqa hinachu kanku.
I think he wants to be home.	Yuyaykuni wasinpi kayta munasqanmanta.
This is not always the case.	Kayqa manam sapa kutichu chayna.
Very, very fast.	Ancha, ancha utqaylla.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu kachkan.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa mana allinchu karqa.
He never really says anything.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas cheqaqtachu imatapas nin.

No, it’s not.	Manan, manan.
Like all night long.	Tukuy tuta hina.
Maybe there’s something else there.	Ichapas chaypi huk imapas kanman.
They are not that good.	Paykunaqa manam chayna allinchu kanku.
She was eager to say yes.	Payqa anchatan munarqan arí niyta.
It made more money.	Aswan qullqita ruwarqa.
Everything is better.	Tukuy imapas aswan allinmi.
In fact, it was more every day.	Chiqaptaqa sapa punchawmi aswan achka karqa.
That’s what he told me.	Chaytan niwarqan.
Not much here, either.	Mana ancha kaypi, nitaq.
It was about thirty.	Yaqa chunka kimsa chunka kasqa.
He does this a lot.	Payqa anchatam kayta ruwan.
Hopefully there isn’t.	Munaymanmi mana kanchu.
He’s very nice about it.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi chaymanta.

You don’t quite know how to do that.	Mana allintachu yachanki imaynatachus chayta ruwanki chayta.

You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
You’re probably going to be.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanki.
I couldn’t get over how good it was.	Manam atipayta atirqanichu imayna allin kasqanmantaqa.
But no one could do anything about it.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaymantaqa imatapas ruwayta atirqanchu.
I know that it is.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta.
Everything is fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.
He can’t do anything.	Manan imapipas ruwayta atinmanchu.
He knows what he did wrong.	Payqa yachanmi mana allin ruwasqanmanta.
It looks really nice.	Chiqap sumaqmi rikchakun.

It will be safer.	Aswan seguro kanqa.
He knew, he knew.	Payqa yacharqanmi, payqa yacharqanmi.
Now it’s not good.	Kunanqa mana allin.
Maybe it’s too good.	Ichapas ancha allin.
I knew this was the case.	Kaytaqa yacharqanim.
He looked like anyone.	Payqa pimanpas rikchakurqa.

Anything, everything, nothing.	Imapas, tukuy ima, mana ima.
This was, all right.	Kayqa karqan, allinmi.
This is not the best way.	Kayqa manam aswan allinchu.

No, that wouldn’t be right.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
There’s nothing wrong with it, really.	Manam imapas mana allinchu, chiqaptaqa.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
That wasn’t a bad thing.	Chayqa manan mana allinchu karqan.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
I thought it would be quick.	Utqaylla kananta yuyaykurqani.
You have to do it right now.	Kunanmi allinta ruwanayki.
But it doesn't seem very nice.	Ichaqa manan ancha sumaq hinachu.

But you’ll have to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanayki kanqa.
I would like this to happen.	Munaymanmi kay pasananta.

He was sure something was wrong.	Payqa segurom karqa imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Mana allinchu karqan.

Being a good person.	Allin runa kay.
The great thing is.	Hatun kaq.
Nothing there now.	Mana imapas chaypi kunanqa.
But he didn't want to say anything bad.	Ichaqa manan mana allin rimayta munarqanchu.
He was a man of the past.	Payqa huk runam karqa.
He was sad and worried.	Payqa llakisqa, llakisqa ima kasqa.
Now I knew it.	Kunanqa yacharqanim.
All right, all right, he said.	Allinmi, allinmi, nispa.
I did that, yes.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani, arí.
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.

Today is a good day.	Kunan punchawqa allinmi.
Not the second.	Mana iskay kaq.
They are happy.	Paykunaqa kusisqam kachkanku.

This seemed like it would work.	Kayqa allin kanman hinam rikchakurqa.
Does anyone know what that means?.	¿Pipas yachanchu chay niyta munan?.
I didn’t mean it now.	Manam kunanqa niyta munarqanichu.
That’s what I had to do first.	Chaytan ñawpaqtaqa ruwanay karqan.
It’s more interesting that way.	Aswan sumaqmi chayna.
Maybe you’re a newbie.	Ichapas huk musuq kaq kanki.
About everything now.	Tukuy imamanta kunan.
He was a nice guy.	Payqa sumaq runam karqa.

Such a great guy.	Chayna hatun runa.

He was happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqam karqa.
But he refuses to talk to her.	Ichaqa manan munanchu paywan rimayta.

We are not good at this.	Kaypiqa manam allinchu kanchik.
I think this is all good.	Kayqa tukuy allinmi nispan yuyaykuni.
But it can’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
This is probably not a good thing.	Kayqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu.
He really doesn’t know.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana yachanchu.
He knew he wouldn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana ruwananta.
Once, he told me he wasn't there.	Huk kuti, niwarqa mana chaypi kasqanmanta.
I thought, well, you want to know.	Yuyarqanim, allinmi, yachayta munanki.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
Probably did such a good job.	Yaqapaschá chayna allin llamkayta ruwarqa.
It was probably too big.	Yaqapaschá sinchi hatun karqan.
Being an individual.	Sapa runa kay.
He's really into it.	Payqa chiqaptam chaypi kachkan.
It doesn’t mean that.	Mana niyta munan.
In fact, it’s great.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha allinmi.
Maybe it was worse.	Ichapas aswan mana allin karqa.
It’s okay with me.	Allinmi ñuqawan.
It wasn’t very good.	Manam llumpay allinchu karqa.
This seemed bad, bad, bad.	Kayqa mana allin, mana allin, mana allin hinam karqa.
Almost always.	Yaqa sapa kutim.
I am not so sure about that.	Chaymantaqa manam chayna segurochu kani.
He knew this was not so.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayqa mana chhayna kasqanmanta.
That’s going to happen.	Chay pasananta.
He declined to say how much.	Payqa manan hayk’a kasqanmanta willayta munarqanchu.

It was a beautiful experience.	Sumaqmi karqan.

He knew it wasn't.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana chayna kasqanmanta.
But now was truly a better time.	Ichaqa kunanqa cheqaqtapunin aswan allin tiempo karqan.
Hopefully it never happens.	Munaymanmi mana haykapipas chayna kananta.
It’s okay with me.	Allinmi ñuqawan.
Nowadays, it seems like pretty much everything is about me.	Kunan tiempopiqa yaqa tukuy imapas ñuqamanta hinam kachkan.
But he told me to do it.	Ichaqa ruwanaypaqmi niwarqa.
He was worried now.	Payqa kunanmi llakisqa kasqa.
She is as beautiful as ever.	Payqa ñawpaq hina sumaqmi.
He knows you can do it.	Payqa yachanmi chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
But he probably did.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqan.
I hope he's not married.	Suyachkani mana casarasqa kasqanmanta.
The more you do the more you learn.	Astawan ruwanki astawan yachanki.
He knows he can’t do it.	Payqa yachanmi mana ruwayta atisqanmanta.
That's pretty obvious.	Chayqa ancha sut'inmi.

Everything is fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi kachkan.

No way, it’s not good.	Mana imayna, mana allinchu.
Tired, tired.	Sayk'usqa, sayk'usqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
He says he can’t help it.	Mana yanapayta atinchu nin.
I know that it is not.	Yachanim mana chayna kasqanmanta.
I know you want more from me.	Yachanim aswan imatapas ñuqamanta munasqaykita.
He doesn’t want to.	Payqa manam munanchu.

They are not sure.	Paykunaqa manan segurochu kanku.
I thought there was more, maybe.	Yuyarqanim aswan achka kasqanmanta, ichapas.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
It was supposed to be good.	Allinmi kanan karqa.
And he was terrified.	Hinan payqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
You are so beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi kanki.
You can’t talk about it.	Mana rimayta atiwaqchu.
Make a statement.	Huk rimayta ruway.

Yes, he knows a lot about this.	Arí, payqa anchatam kaymanta yachan.

Do the right thing.	Chayta ruway.
No, it’s not.	Manan, manan.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
You will have to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanayki kanqa.
That’s pretty much it actually.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chiqaptaqa.

Less than that is good.	Aswan pisi chaymanta allin.
They are very nice though.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi ichaqa.
He refused to believe it.	Mana creeyta munarqanchu.
Nothing was right.	Manan imapas allinchu karqan.
I think of him as a bad person.	Mana allin runa hinam piensani.
That’s all, it’s .	Chaylla, chayqa .
Okay, a couple of things.	Allinmi, huk iskay imakuna.
I know how hard it is.	Yachanim chayna sasa kasqanmanta.
Two truths, in fact.	Iskay chiqap, chiqaptaqa.

Neither did I.	Nitaq ñuqapas.
But that is not the right thing to do.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manan allinchu.
But it’s not always bad or bad.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu mana allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.

It was really nice.	Chiqaptam sumaq karqa.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.

I am here to make this right.	Kayta allinta ruwanaypaqmi kaypi kachkani.
Here’s the good, here’s the bad.	Kaypi allin, kaypi mana allin.

It wasn’t always that way.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna karqa.
He did that with some success.	Chaytaqa wakin allintam ruwarqa.

Why not, then.	¿Imanasqataq mana.
I didn’t do it right.	Manam allintachu ruwarqani.
Better for you.	Aswan allin qampaq.
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.
You have to do things right.	Imatapas allintam ruwanayki.
No, it’s okay.	Manan, allinmi.
Maybe it’s faster, maybe not.	Ichapas aswan utqaylla kanman, ichapas mana.

He certainly does.	Cheqaqtapunin payqa ruwan.
I am very happy about it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chaymanta.
This is clearly not the case here.	Kayqa sut’inmi kaypiqa mana chay hinachu.
Can you maybe.	¿Atiwaqchu ichapas.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
I still don't know why.	Kunankamapas manam yachanichu imanasqa chaytaqa.
Do the action.	Chay ruwayta ruway.
But maybe second best.	Ichaqa ichapas iskay kaq allin kaq.
He was sure of that.	Chayna kasqanmantam payqa seguro karqa.
It didn’t go well.	Mana allintachu rirqa.
That will be the worst.	Chayqa aswan mana allinmi kanqa.
Actually things weren't right about this.	Chiqaptaqa imapas manam allinchu karqa kaymanta.

There is no time.	Manam tiempo kanchu.
You were so beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi karqanki.
Something did this.	Imapas kayta ruwarqa.
But then, maybe .	Ichaqa chaymantaqa, ichapas .
I couldn’t have said it.	Manam niyta atiymanchu karqa.
It’s better though.	Aswan allinmi ichaqa.
She’s beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi.
But maybe you knew that.	Ichaqa ichapas chayta yacharqanki.
But this isn’t it.	Ichaqa kayqa manan.
No you can’t.	Manan manan atiwaqchu.
You want to do better.	Munanki aswan allin ruwayta.

Again he couldn’t.	Hukmanta mana atirqanchu.
Do it again.	Hukmanta ruway.
I didn’t want to tell you.	Manam willayta munarqanichu.

No, he would do what he had to do.	Manan, imachus ruwananta ruwanman karqan.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
I'd be fine.	Allinmi kayman.
They’re probably.	Paykunaqa ichapas.
This was still very interesting though.	Kayqa hinallam ancha sumaq karqa ichaqa.
This should be really interesting.	Kayqa chiqaptam sumaq kanan.
This means you’ll have to do more work.	Kayqa niyta munan aswan llamk’ayta ruwanayki tiyan.
Obviously he couldn’t do that.	Sut’inmi mana chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
But not after that.	Ichaqa mana chaymantaqa.
This is doing very well.	Kayqa ancha allintam ruwachkan.
Perhaps this did not seem right.	Yaqapaschá kayqa mana allintachu rikchakurqa.
Today is a good day.	Kunan punchawmi allin punchaw.
He wasn’t really upset.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu phiñasqa kasharqan.
It’s not a good idea to do that.	Mana allinchu chayta ruwayqa.
He is here now.	Payqa kunanmi kaypi kachkan.
Maybe it should be.	Ichapas kanan.
He didn't want to say anything at the time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan imatapas niyta munarqanchu.

He was very happy.	Payqa llumpay kusisqam karqa.
It was like an inhuman being.	Mana runa hinam karqa.

You are really there.	Chiqaptam chaypi kachkanki.

He seemed to do that a lot actually.	Payqa chaytaqa anchata ruwaq hinam karqa chiqaptaqa.

Very good at nothing.	Ancha allin mana imapipas.

There was nothing you could do at that time.	Chay tiempopiqa manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu karqan.

It doesn’t get any worse than that.	Manam chaymantaqa aswan mana allinchu.
He was a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam karqa.
He can’t beat that!.	¡Manan chayta atipayta atinchu!.
But that’s a very good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa ancha allinmi.
He is not very good.	Payqa manam ancha allinchu.
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.
What’s the right thing to do.	Imataq allin kachkan.
That there should be no one.	Mana pipas kananta.
The best part of it.	Aswan allin kaq.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
I hope he does well here.	Suyachkani kaypi allinta ruwananta.
I don't know why he's here.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa kaypi kasqanmanta.
It’s always been there.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi karqan.
It certainly means that.	Cheqaqtapunin chay niyta munan.
I know that it is.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta.
A good guy.	Allin runa.
There is no such thing as a fact.	Manam imapas kanchu chayta huk chiqap hina.
He is not here.	Payqa manan kaypichu kashan.
Something was wrong there.	Chaypi imapas mana allinchu karqa.
When will it be available? 	¿Hayk’aqmi kanqa?
. . . .	.
I don’t want to say anything.	Manam imatapas niyta munanichu.
They seem to be here all the time now.	Kunanqa tukuy tiempo kaypi hina kachkanku.
It was always like that.	Sapa kutim chayna karqa.
Maybe you know, maybe you don’t.	Ichapas yachanki, ichapas mana.
That was not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanan karqan.
A good man though.	Allin runa ichaqa.

Much more time.	Aswan achka tiempo.
But it certainly isn’t.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana.
Do you know why?.	¿Yachankichu imarayku?.
But it isn’t.	Ichaqa manan.
He is no longer alone.	Manaña sapallanchu.
Today was the worst.	Kunan punchawmi aswan mana allin karqa.
He said he was there against his will.	Payqa nirqam mana munasqanmanta chaypi kasqanmanta.
He never wanted to.	Mana hayk’aqpas munarqanchu.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
That said a lot.	Chayqa anchatam nirqa.
The next morning was fine.	Paqarin paqarinmi allin karqa.
Otherwise, it’s not.	Mana chayqa, mana.
But he wanted to know.	Ichaqa yachayta munarqa.
I was the guy who was.	Ñuqaqa chay runam karqani.
But it was supposed to be.	Ichaqa chayna kanan karqa.
Everything went very well.	Tukuy imapas ancha allintam rirqa.
All alone.	Tukuy sapallan.
He doesn’t know exactly.	Payqa manan allintachu yachan.
But it is wonderful that he does.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwan chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
It's never good, really.	Manam haykapipas allinchu, chiqaptaqa.
I’ve always wanted to do that.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayta ruwayta munarqani.
I’m in the position.	Ñuqaqa kachkani.
Why, why now.	Imarayku, imarayku kunan.
It really wasn't too bad.	Chiqaptaqa manam ancha mana allinchu karqa.
Maybe ten won’t be good enough.	Ichapas chunka mana allinchu kanqa.
I want to make a game.	Huk pukllayta ruwayta munani.
It was a lonely one.	Chayqa sapallanmi karqa.
No one should be so happy.	Manan pipas chay hina kusisqachu kanan.
He wanted to believe it.	Chaytaqa creeyta munarqa.
A lot, though.	Achka, ichaqa.
We’re better than that.	Chaymantaqa aswan allinmi kayku.
He hasn’t done much yet.	Payqa manaraqmi anchatachu ruwan.
This should now be clearer.	Kayqa kunanqa aswan sut’inmi kanan.
Is he the one?	¿Payqa?
I’ve wanted to do that for a long time.	Chaytaqa unayñan ruwayta munarqani.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He was scared, now.	Payqa mancharisqa, kunanqa.
For more information.	Astawan kananpaq.
This is a good one this year.	Kayqa allinmi kay wata.
I'm fine, actually.	Allinmi kachkani, chiqaptaqa.
But he couldn’t be, not really.	Ichaqa manan kayta atirqanchu, manan cheqaqtachu.
Like, it’s very difficult.	Imayna, ancha sasa.
He is a single person.	Payqa huk sapallan runam.
I mean, that was pretty bad.	Niyta munani, chayqa ancha mana allinmi karqa.
More on that here.	Chaymanta astawan kaypi.
But here it is.	Ichaqa kaypi.
He always says he can tell.	Payqa sapa kutim willayta atisqanmanta nin.
That’s not the right thing to do.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmanta.
Something must be.	Imapas kanan.
I am sure of that.	Chaymantaqa segurom kachkani.
I didn’t see anything.	Manam imatapas rikurqanichu.
I know exactly what it is like.	Allintam yachani imayna kasqanmanta.
I'm good.	Allinmi kani.
What a beautiful man.	Ima sumaq runa.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
That’s a good thing about it.	Chayqa allinmi chaymantaqa.
In fact, he did it alone.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwarqa.
But at least it looks like it.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá chayna rikchakun.
Maybe something was wrong.	Ichapas imapas mana allinchu karqa.
That has always been the case.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
What! 	Ima!
But that wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
It was a very special day.	Chayqa ancha hatun punchawmi karqa.
I think it's just that.	Chaylla kasqanmantam piensani.
But okay, everything is fine now.	Ichaqa allinmi, kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
He knew he was there.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaypi kashasqanmanta.
We are not happy.	Mana kusisqachu kanchik.
But it won’t be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanqa.
But, of course he did.	Ichaqa, sut’inmi chayta ruwarqan.
You’re happy, right?.	Kusisqam kachkanki ¿aw?.
It makes everything more uncertain and more interesting.	Tukuy imata aswan mana seguro kananpaq, aswan sumaq kananpaq ima ruwan.
I can't say that.	Chaytaqa manam niyta atiymanchu.
Do it, and you’ll do better.	Chayta ruway, aswan allintan ruwanki.
Nothing is right or wrong.	Manan imapas allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
Who wants money.	Pitaq qullqita munan.
I can’t be that uncertain.	Manam chayna mana seguro kayta atiymanchu.
I hope it will be good on its own.	Suyachkani sapallan allin kananta.
That was really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi karqa.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
That’s not a bad thing.	Chayqa manam mana allinchu.
This can never be easy.	Kayqa manan hayk’aqpas facilchu kanman.
But yes, he really did.	Ichaqa arí, cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwarqan.
Otherwise, nothing will work.	Mana chayqa manan imapas allinchu kanqa.
This is a new year.	Kayqa musuq wata.
Do it now.	Kunan ruway.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
But if it isn’t.	Ichaqa mana chayqa.
It was a good day.	Allin punchawmi karqa.
She was beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa.
Now I am a human being.	Kunanqa runam kani.
Not good but not bad.	Mana allinchu ichaqa mana mana allinchu.
I didn’t know what it was.	Manam yacharqanichu ima kasqanmanta.
I’m not very happy either.	Ñuqapas manam ancha kusisqachu kani.
But you are beautiful in a different way.	Ichaqa huk hina sumaqmi kanki.
This, or that.	Kay, icha chay.
Everything seemed wrong.	Tukuy imapas mana allintachu rikchakurqa.
He can't help it.	Mana yanapayta atinchu.
I'll do it now, that's all.	Kunanmi ruwasaq, chaylla.
You're tired of it.	Sayk'usqa kanki.
That would be human.	Chayqa runa hinam kanman.
But it can’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
He never knows.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas yachanchu.
But it should be here soon.	Ichaqa usqhayllan kaypi kanan.
In fact, it’s better than that.	Chiqaptaqa, chaymantaqa aswan allinmi.
But he is not alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu.
Hopefully, it wouldn’t be too bad.	Munaymanmi, mana ancha mana allinchu kanman.
He had to be.	Payqa kanan karqan.
Someone did that.	Pipas chayta ruwarqa.
I know where they are together.	Yachanim maypi kuska kasqankuta.
I am very happy with it.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani.
I wasn’t so sure.	Manam chayna segurochu karqani.
He’s not the best.	Payqa manan aswan allinchu.

I would love to go there one day.	Munaymanmi huk punchaw chayman riyta.
That would be quick.	Chayqa utqaylla kanman.
He refused to share it with her.	Payqa manan paywan willayta munarqanchu.
I don’t want to talk.	Manam rimayta munanichu.
You’ve been married for a long time.	Unayñan casarasqa kanki.
He is very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allin runam karqa.
That is not human.	Chayqa manan runa hinachu.
That was a wonderful thing to be married to.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa casarasqa kayqa.
I really look forward to it again.	Chiqaptam hukmanta suyachkani.
I'm sure it will be good.	Seguro kani allin kanqa.
I was there all the time.	Tukuy tiempo chaypi karqani.
I will do everything right.	Tukuy imatam allinta ruwasaq.
But he was probably alone.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá sapallan kasharqan.
What is he, he is.	Imataq payqa.
I suspect it is.	Sospechani chayna kasqanmanta.
It won’t be a good one.	Mana allinchu kanqa.
There isn’t a yes.	Manam kanchu arí.
I don’t think it’s going to be a big deal.	Manam yuyanichu huk hatun ruway kananta.
Do it tomorrow.	Paqarin ruway.
I didn’t want that, but this was fine.	Manam chaytaqa munarqanichu, ichaqa kayqa allinmi karqa.
I don't really know why.	Manam chiqaptachu yachani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
No, that wasn’t a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
He was angry now.	Payqa kunanqa phiñasqa kasqa.
He does a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwan.
Okay maybe a little bit.	Allinmi ichapas huk chikan.
He is a beautiful man.	Payqa sumaq runam.
I can’t tell you.	Manam willayta atinichu.
He knows you are here with him.	Payqa yachanmi kaypi paywan kasqaykita.
It’s probably the case.	Yaqapaschá chayna kanman.
That seemed to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
Obviously, he was wrong.	Sut’inmi, payqa mana allintachu nisqa.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
I was the one.	Ñuqaqa karqani.
Kani was ten.	Kani chunka karqan.
Someone was at home.	Pipas wasinpi kasqa.
It’s a great way to do it there.	Chaypi ruwayqa ancha allinmi.

I wasn’t good enough.	Manam allinchu karqani.
It’s so much more interesting.	Ancha aswan sumaqmi.
No, it won’t be good.	Manan, manan allinchu kanqa.
I am very happy about that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam kusikuni.
This was not an easy task.	Kayqa manam facilchu karqa.
Very perhaps it would be right.	Ancha ichapas allinta kanman.
Yesterday was a great day!.	¡Qayna punchawmi ancha allin punchaw karqa!.
It was always like that.	Sapa kutim chayna karqa.
That would have been the case.	Chayna kanman karqa.
No, actually.	Manam, chiqaptaqa.
He says it’s okay.	Payqa allinmi nin.
Angry was good.	Phiñasqa allin kasqa.
I'm sure it is.	Seguro kani chayna kasqanmanta.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
That was the best thing ever.	Chayqa aswan allinmi karqan.
No, he couldn’t have done that.	Manan, manan chayta ruwayta atinmanchu karqan.
You can never have that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa atiwaqchu.
I’m fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kani.
I don’t ask too many questions.	Manam anchatachu tapukuni.
It was supposed to be late.	Tarde kanan karqa.
He was very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa kasqa.
That seemed nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
Perhaps that was the case.	Yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
Not really sure why.	Mana chiqaptachu yachani imanasqa kasqanmanta.
It’s probably not going to be a good thing.	Manachá allinchu kanqa.

Something could be wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.

That’s a good thing though.	Chayqa allinmi ichaqa.
This is not humane.	Kayqa mana runa hinachu.
You had to do something.	Imatapas ruwanayki karqan.
That was completely wrong.	Chayqa tukuy imapipas mana allinmi karqa.
I’d be better off too.	Ñuqapas aswan allinmi kanman.
I know that for sure.	Chaytaqa allintam yachani.
I’m not really worried.	Manam chiqaptachu llakikuni.

More than that.	Aswan chaymanta.
Maybe tonight’s performance will be.	Ichapas kunan tuta ruwayqa kanqa.
That worked out very well.	Chayqa ancha allintam ruwarqa.
He’s doing well.	Payqa allinmi kachkan.
I don’t worry too much about it.	Manam anchatachu chaymantaqa llakikuni.
I was like I was.	Ñuqaqa hinam karqani.
However, it is very good.	Ichaqa, ancha allinmi.
I thought that was really interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
Obviously it’s not good.	Sut’inmi mana allinchu.
Maybe he was the one.	Ichapas payqa chayna karqa.
He had to continue.	Payqa hinallam kanan karqa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.

You know this, you know.	Kayta yachanki.
He really didn't want her to do this.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana munarqanchu kayta ruwananta.
They're tired and scared.	Paykunaqa sayk'usqa, mancharisqa ima kachkanku.
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
I think he could have done that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwayta atinman karqan.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I mean, really, almost never.	Niyta munani, chiqap, yaqa mana haykapipas.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqan.
Would it be better.	Aswan allinchu kanman.
Nothing, now, no one.	Mana imapas, kunanqa, manam pipas kanchu.
But that wouldn’t be right.	Ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
He couldn’t do it.	Payqa manan atirqanchu.
He did that in the past.	Ñawpaqtaqa chaytan ruwarqan.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
Like, really nice.	Imayna, chiqap sumaq.
I know what he likes.	Yachanim ima gustasqanmanta.
He is a bad guy.	Payqa mana allin runam.

But it’s busy.	Ichaqa ocupasqa kashan.
He looked sad.	Llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
Yes, she was beautiful.	Arí, payqa sumaqmi karqa.
Now, it’s nice.	Kunanqa, sumaqmi.
That has always been the case.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
I know that it is.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta.
Yes, he will be happy.	Arí, payqa kusisqam kanqa.
I know this to be true.	Kayqa chiqap kasqanmantam yachani.
That would be a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
More recently.	Aswan kunan.

This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
But that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi.
I don’t care about that.	Manam chaymantaqa imananpaschu.
I know it is important.	Yachanim ancha allin kasqanmanta.
This is not a bad thing.	Kayqa manam mana allinchu.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But everything was fine.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.

That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
He wasn't quite sure what he meant.	Payqa manan allintachu seguro kasharqan ima niyta munasqanmanta.
You were so beautiful.	Ancha sumaqmi karqanki.
Which was so good.	Imataq chayna allin karqa.
He’s a really great guy.	Payqa chiqap hatun runam.
Maybe that was a little quick on my part.	Ichapas chayqa huk chikan utqaylla ñuqamanta karqa.
He is all right.	Payqa tukuy allinmi.
Obviously he can’t do that anymore.	Sut’inmi kashan manaña chayta ruwayta atinmanchu.
He was probably here.	Payqa yaqapaschá kaypi karqan.
No one knows how to do that.	Pipas chayta ruwayta yachanchu.
You’re something.	Imapas kanki.
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
I know what it’s like.	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta.

This was a wonderful experience.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
It could have been something.	Imapas kanman karqan.
You really mean it.	Chiqaptam niyta munanki.
That was a beautiful thing.	Chayqa sumaqmi karqa.
What would it have been.	Imataq kanman karqa.
He knew what he was going to do.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwananta.
He couldn’t believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
It just does it.	Chaylla ruwan.
In fact, it could be worse than that.	Chiqaptaqa chaymantaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman.
Maybe this does.	Ichapas kay ruwan.
It looked pretty good.	Allin allinmi rikchakurqa.
He did that yesterday, in fact.	Chaytaqa qayna punchawmi ruwarqa, chiqaptaqa.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Too much coffee, no coffee.	Llumpay kukata, mana kukata.
But nobody cares.	Ichaqa manan pipas imananpaschu.
No one can do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.

This can be really hard sometimes.	Kayqa chiqap sasa kanman wakin kuti.

To be quick, you know.	Utqaylla kananpaq, yachanki.
He was a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam karqa.
Everything is fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi.
I’m going to do it right away.	Ñuqaqa chaylla ruwasaq.
He was terrified.	Payqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
Obviously he wasn’t hurt.	Sut’inmi mana k’irisqa karqan.
Now he plans to do just that.	Kunanqa chayta ruwayta yuyaykushan.
He wants to say something, but he can’t.	Imatapas niyta munan, ichaqa manan atinchu.

He knew where he was now.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan maypi kashasqanmanta.
It’s probably going to be.	Yaqapaschá kanqa.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
But is that really the case? 	Ichaqa, ¿cheqaqtachu chayna?

But it was a bad thing.	Ichaqa mana allinmi karqan.
That’s what it looked like.	Chayqa rikchakurqa.
You didn’t know what happened.	Manam yacharqankichu ima pasasqanmanta.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu.
That’s right, sadly.	Chayqa allinmi, llakisqa.
That’s what he would have done.	Chaytan payqa ruwanman karqan.
I will do that, probably very soon.	Chaytaqa ruwasaq, ichapas ancha utqaylla.
It probably wasn’t good enough.	Manapaschá allinchu karqan.
But he still couldn’t do it right.	Ichaqa manaraqmi allinta ruwayta atirqanchu.
Yes, that would be a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi kanman.
But he didn’t know.	Ichaqa manan yacharqanchu.
Where are they?.	¿Maypitaq kachkanku?.
He was a man of good character.	Payqa allin ruwaq runan karqan.
He was very nervous today.	Payqa kunan punchawmi anchata mancharisqa.
They are still the best.	Paykunaqa kunankamapas aswan allinmi.

Everything is beautiful.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi.
Almost nothing else can do that.	Yaqapaschá mana imapas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.

Nobody likes it.	Manan pipas gustanchu.

Be happy, be happy, be good.	Kusisqa kay, kusisqa kay, allin kay.
Then another, bigger one.	Chaymanta huk, aswan hatun.

He's quite happy about it.	Payqa chaymantaqa allintam kusisqa kachkan.
No, it wasn’t good.	Manan, manan allinchu karqan.
There, there, there.	Chaypi, chaypi.
Of course, that will never work.	Arí, chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanqa.
Very sad indeed.	Ancha llakisqa chiqap.
No, it wouldn’t be right.	Manan, manan allinchu kanman.

I don’t really like it.	Manam anchatachu gustan.

Of course, he couldn’t do that.	Arí, manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
They are very nice.	Paykunaqa ancha sumaqmi.

I want her to be happy.	Munani kusisqa kananta.
I'll do it today.	Kunanmi ruwasaq.

You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
He didn’t seem upset at all.	Payqa manan imapipas phiñasqa hinachu karqan.
He would have continued.	Payqa hinallam kanman karqa.
It’s just not very good.	Chaylla mana ancha allinchu.
That’s not easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu.
But he didn’t want that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa munarqanchu.

He can’t beat it.	Mana atipayta atinchu.
I don’t really like it.	Manam anchatachu gustan.
He didn’t know that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa yacharqanchu.
No, it's not	Manan, manan .

You can’t do anything about it.	Manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.

Okay, a little bit.	Allinmi, huk chikan.

That was a really big deal.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin ancha hatun ruway karqan.

Okay, that’s better.	Allinmi, chayqa aswan allinmi.

He didn’t do much of anything.	Payqa manan anchatachu imatapas ruwarqan.

No one is really good now.	Kunanqa manam pipas chiqaptaqa allinchu.

That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I’m sorry, but that’s not right.	Pampachaykuway, ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu.
Otherwise it would make things worse.	Mana chayqa aswan mana allintan ruwanman.

No, it’s not.	Manan, manan.

Now he was angry.	Kunanqa phiñasqa kasqa.

That would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman.
He said that it was.	Chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.

That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But he knows why.	Ichaqa yachanmi imanasqa chayta.

I didn’t know what it was like though.	Manam yacharqanichu imayna kasqanmanta ichaqa.
He couldn’t be this.	Payqa manan kayta atirqanchu.

You’re tired.	Sayk’usqa kanki.
He was a little annoyed.	Payqa huk chhikantan phiñasqa kasharqan.

Where was he all last year.	Maypitaq tukuy qayna wata karqa.
No one knew what had happened to him.	Manan pipas yacharqanchu imachus paywan pasasqanmanta.

It’s like something new.	Imapas musuq kaq hinam.

Everything seemed as it should be.	Tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam rikchakurqa.

He had a very nice conversation with her.	Paywan ancha sumaq rimayta ruwarqa.
I wish I had a good time with him.	Munaymanmi paywan allinta rimayta.
Do it right.	Allinta ruway.
I think he is something else.	Payqa huk imapas kasqanmantam piensani.
He is doing very well.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwachkan.
Both would be great.	Iskayninkum ancha allin kanman.
We’re very good at it.	Ancha allinmi kayku.
Do that first.	Ñawpaqtaqa chayta ruway.
He was obviously upset now.	Payqa sut’inmi kunanqa phiñasqa kasharqan.
Something to get the job done.	Imapas chay llamkayta ruwananpaq.
Here’s what I mean.	Kaypi niyta munani.
He says it's not good.	Mana allinchu nispa nin.
It looks really bad.	Chiqaptam mana allin rikchakun.

He is alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kachkan.
You don’t know why.	Manam yachankichu imanasqa chaytaqa.

He knew what this was.	Payqa yacharqanmi imachus kay kasqanmanta.
Maybe it was the time.	Ichapas chay tiempo karqa.
Some bad, some good.	Wakin mana allin, wakin allin.
I was very curious.	Anchatam yachayta munarqani.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I know that now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi yachani.
I’m alone in myself.	Sapallanmi kani.
That would have a negative effect.	Chayqa mana allintam ruwanman.
Yes, yes, yes.	Arí, arí.
But he could not speak.	Ichaqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
That wouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanman.
Everyone seems so happy.	Lliwmi ancha kusisqa hina kanku.
That was not a good thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa mana allinchu karqa.

He was sure of it.	Payqa seguro kasqa chaymanta.
It was a really great day.	Chiqaptam hatun punchaw karqa.

He doesn’t want to go.	Payqa manam riyta munanchu.
You can’t not, it’s not like this.	Manan mana atiwaqchu, manan kay hinachu.

Indeed, he did.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.

Do it now.	Kunan ruway.
Very, very sad.	Ancha, ancha llakisqa.

That’s obviously not the case.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
They are just that.	Paykunaqa chaylla kanku.
I wonder why.	Tapukuni imarayku.
There is no second option.	Iskay kaq ruwayqa manam kanchu.

More than a little bit.	Aswan huk chikan.
That’s what you’re doing.	Chayta ruwasqaykita.
That’s not going to be any good.	Chayqa manan imapas allinchu kanqa.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
But no one thought of it.	Ichaqa manan pipas yuyaykurqanchu.
It doesn’t do it right.	Mana allintachu ruwan.
Everything about it.	Tukuy ima chaymanta.

Nothing was like it is now.	Manan imapas kunan hinachu karqan.
That would have been a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman karqa.
It won’t be a good one.	Mana allinchu kanqa.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I had a lot to do.	Achka ruwanay karqa.

This was a great experience.	Kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I didn’t want to be here.	Manam kaypi kaytaqa munarqanichu.
I think that is true.	Chayqa chiqap kasqanmantam piensani.

I can't believe it, actually.	Mana creeyta atinichu, chiqaptaqa.

Of course, you know better than that.	Arí, chaymantaqa aswan allintan yachanki.

Now, here’s one.	Kunanqa, kaypi huk.

I know you mean well.	Yachanim allinta niyta munasqaykita.
I didn't think about this.	Kaypiqa manam piensarqanichu.
I’m afraid that’s wrong.	Manchakuni chay mana allin kasqanmanta.
That’s what it does.	Chaytan ruwan.
It was a very good experience.	Ancha allinmi karqa.
There used to be ten.	Ñawpaqtaqa chunka karqan.
Obviously, that wasn’t the case.	Sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu karqan.
Everything looks great.	Tukuy imapas ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.

That’s not going to be easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu kanqa.

I know what it is now.	Yachanim kunan ima kasqanmanta.
He is good enough to be bad.	Payqa allinmi mana allin kananpaq.
That’s if you want it.	Chayqa munanki chayqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqan.
Both were excellent.	Iskayninkum ancha allin karqa.
He's fine here.	Payqa kaypiqa allinmi kachkan.
He is a bad guy.	Payqa mana allin runam.
He had things to do.	Payqa imakuna ruwanan karqan.
But it really doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana imananpaschu.
I wasn’t up to it.	Manam chayman hinachu karqani.
No one can do that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa ruwayta atinmanchu.
Of course, this is still very uncertain.	Arí, kayqa kunankamapas ancha mana segurochu kachkan.

This was a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinmi karqa.
He was furious.	Payqa phiñasqa kasharqan.

He was not very happy.	Payqa manam ancha kusisqachu karqa.
He wanted to know everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta yachayta munarqa.
Now he’s the one.	Kunanqa payqa.

But he may not be alone.	Ichaqa manapaschá sapallanchu kanman.
But I don’t know.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu.
He couldn’t get over this.	Payqa manan kaytaqa atipayta atirqanchu.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu.

I thought he would be happy.	Yuyarqanim kusisqa kananta.
But that is not really the case.	Ichaqa manan cheqaqtachu chayqa.
I told him to do it.	Chayta ruwananpaqmi nirqani.
He knows where he’s supposed to be.	Payqa yachanmi maypi kananta.
Do it for someone.	Pimanpas ruway.
I have too much to do tomorrow.	Paqarinmi llumpayta ruwanay kachkan.

That’s not easy though.	Chayqa manan facilchu ichaqa.

But it is a good thing to do.	Ichaqa allinmi chay ruwayqa.
He did this every day.	Chaytaqa sapa punchawmi ruwarqa.
He seems depressed.	Payqa llakisqa hinam kachkan.
It was actually too bad.	Chiqaptaqa llumpay mana allinmi karqa.
He would be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanman.
That was supposed to be.	Chayqa kanan karqan.
But he was injured.	Ichaqa k’irisqa kasharqan.
It’s not a good idea to do that.	Mana chayta ruwayqa mana allinchu.
Maybe this was the future.	Ichapas kay hamuq tiempo karqa.
She was so beautiful.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi kasqa.
More on this here.	Astawan kaymanta kaypi.

He refused to believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta munarqanchu.
I want this job.	Kay llamkayta munani.
But he wouldn’t be alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu kanman karqan.
Maybe he can do it now.	Ichapas kunanqa ruwayta atinman.
I don’t want that.	Manam chaytaqa munanichu.
I don’t know that it’s going to happen.	Manam yachanichu chayna kananta.
This was a great experience.	Kayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I know it’s good.	Yachanim allin kasqanmanta.
However, this approach is not recommended.	Ichaqa kay ruwayqa mana allinchu.
He said he would be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanqa nispa.
Which was nice.	Imataq sumaq karqa.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.

Maybe he really wasn't that good.	Ichapas payqa chiqaptaqa mana chayna allinchu karqa.
He couldn’t tell the truth.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu willayta atinman karqan.
Not sure what you mean here.	Mana segurochu kaypi ima niyta munanki.

It would be nice though.	Allinmi kanman ichaqa.
But, something.	Ichaqa, imapas.

He almost seemed scared.	Yaqapaschá mancharisqa hina kasqa.
I question everything.	Tukuy imatam tapukuni.

Of course, that wasn’t a good thing.	Arí, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
I couldn’t tell him anything.	Manam imamantapas willayta atirqanichu.

This was the worst ever.	Kayqa sinchi mana allinmi karqan hayk’aqpas.
That was really quite difficult.	Chayqa chiqaptam ancha sasa karqa.
Great, great, great.	Hatun, hatun, hatun.
I want to do it right.	Allintam ruwayta munani.
He’s a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam.
You’re a good guy.	Allin runam kanki.
This is not a very good thing.	Kayqa manam ancha allinchu.
I wanted to talk more.	Astawan rimayta munarqani.
But it may not be a good idea.	Ichaqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
That was it.	Chayqa karqa.
I mean, he's not here anymore.	Niyta munani, manañam kaypichu kachkan.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu.
Maybe a lot of it.	Ichapas achka.
It’s good, it’s nice.	Allinmi, sumaqmi.
This was a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi karqa.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
Maybe it’s not so bad.	Ichapas mana ancha mana allinchu kanman.
But he couldn't be sure.	Ichaqa manan seguro kayta atirqanchu.
I think that’s great.	Chayqa ancha allinmi nispaymi piensani.
I couldn’t have done it.	Manam atiymanchu karqa.
How do you know that.	Imaynatataq chayta yachanki.
Yes, everything is fine.	Arí, tukuy imapas allinmi.
Maybe he can do something.	Ichapas imatapas ruwayta atinman.
Certainly not.	Cheqaqtapunin mana.
She’s beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi.
But then, well, it was.	Ichaqa chaymanta, allinmi, chayna karqa.
He was happy now.	Payqa kunanmi kusisqa kasharqan.
He will not be alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu kanqa.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
Maybe it was too early.	Ichapas ancha temprano karqa.
That’s not easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu.
I highly doubt that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam iskayrayani.
He and she and him.	Paywan paywan.
You are a very good person.	Ancha allin runam kanki.
There were two repetitions.	Iskay kuti kutim karqa.
But nothing is wrong.	Ichaqa manan imapas mana allinchu.
Would it have been that easy.	¿Chayna facilchu kanman karqa.
Something was terribly wrong.	Imapas sinchi mana allinmi karqa.
I look forward to possibly working with you!.	¡Suyachkani ichapas qamwan llamkayta!.
I said sure enough.	Ñuqaqa segurom nirqani.
He would have to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan kanman karqan.
I’m fine, too.	Ñuqapas allinmi kachkani.
He told me to do it.	Chayta ruwanaypaqmi niwarqa.
Not yet, maybe never.	Manaraqmi, ichapas mana haykapipas.
This would be really useful.	Kayqa chiqaptam allin kanman.
It wasn’t supposed to be like this.	Manan kay hinachu kanan karqan.
He wasn’t alone.	Manam sapallanchu karqa.
Nothing is right anymore.	Manañam imapas allinchu.
Really really difficult.	Chiqap chiqap sasa.
I know it's wrong.	Yachanim mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
How did you know?.	¿Imaynatataq yacharqanki?.
But you have to do it accordingly.	Ichaqa chayman hinan ruwanayki.
This was not always true.	Kayqa manam sapa kutichu chiqap karqa.
Maybe he would have.	Ichapas payqa chayta ruwanman karqa.
Nobody wanted that.	Manan pipas chaytaqa munarqanchu.
Yes, it was a good one.	Arí, allinmi karqa.
He is a human being.	Payqa runam.
I’m not so sure about that.	Manam chaymantaqa anchatachu seguro kani.
But they certainly are not.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin mana chay hinachu kanku.
That was a long time ago.	Chayqa unayñan karqan.
That looks pretty interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi rikchakun.
He would be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanman.
He is doing it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chaytaqa ruwachkan.
You never know.	Manam haykapipas yachankichu.
But this is a very good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha allinmi.
You were happy.	Kusisqam karqanki.
He’s obviously upset.	Payqa sut’inmi phiñasqa kashan.
I know why it is.	Yachanim imanasqa kasqanmanta.
I don’t think it would be right not to.	Manam allinchu kanman mana chaytaqa piensanichu.
How could it be.	Imaynataq kanman.
He is such a	Payqa chayna .
I can’t tell you everything.	Manan tukuy imatapas willayta atiymanchu.
He declined to say why.	Payqa manan munarqanchu imarayku chayta niyta.
He knew he never would.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana hayk’aqpas chayta ruwananta.
Which was a good thing.	Imataq allin karqa.
That's pretty frequent.	Chayqa ancha sapa kutim.
These two.	Kay iskay.
He’s doing well.	Payqa allinmi kachkan.
Everything seems fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakun.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
It does almost anything.	Yaqa tukuy imatam ruwan.
She was excited, but nervous.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan, ichaqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
He did it right.	Allintam ruwarqa.
. . . .	.
I am pretty sure of that.	Chaymantaqa allintam seguro kani.
He kept going.	Payqa hinallam rirqa.
He knows what he can do.	Payqa yachanmi ima ruway atisqanmanta.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
He looked worried now.	Payqa kunanqa llakisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
She’s beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi.
I was indeed exhausted earlier.	Cheqaqtapunin ñawpaqtaqa sayk’usqa karqani.
He couldn’t say anything.	Payqa manan ima niyta atirqanchu.
Two things, actually.	Iskay imapas, chiqaptaqa.
He can't talk now.	Mana kunan rimayta atinchu.
You don’t know anything about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yachankichu.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
It’s going to be good.	Allinmi kanqa.
You are the one who is.	Qamqa chay runam kanki.
Another very good thing.	Huk ancha allin kaq.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kayqa.
But it will be good.	Ichaqa allinmi kanqa.
Perhaps he did.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwarqan.
They are so beautiful.	Chayna sumaqmi kanku.
I want it so much.	Anchatam munani.
He seemed happy.	Payqa kusisqa hinam karqa.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
You’re doing well.	Allinmi kachkanki.
I’m not sure he knows.	Manam segurochu kani yachasqanmanta.
It’s neither good nor bad.	Manan allinchu nitaq mana allinchu.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
It’s not very good.	Mana ancha allinchu.
Another bad day.	Huk mana allin punchaw.
Then a second one.	Chaymanta huk iskay kaq.
One night, one day.	Huk tuta, huk punchaw.
Something is quite wrong.	Imapas allintam mana allinchu.
I’m sorry you can’t.	Mana atiwaqchu nispaymi llakikuni.
Not in this greatness.	Mana hatun kaypichu.
That’s what I meant.	Chaytan niyta munarqani.
He is yours now.	Payqa kunanmi qanpa.
Maybe nothing at all.	Ichapas mana imapas.
I’m sorry, I didn’t know you were someone else.	Pampachaykuway, mana yacharqanichu huk runa kasqaykita.
You don’t know how it is.	Manan yachankichu imaynatachus chaytaqa.
Now it’s more than ever.	Kunanqa aswan ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
I look forward to working with you.	Suyachkani qamwan llamkayta.
I wanted this one.	Kaytaqa munarqani.
Great guy.	Hatun runa.
Maybe it was.	Ichapas karqa.
That was it.	Chayqa karqan.
But he knows it happened, now.	Ichaqa yachanmi chay pasasqanmanta, kunanqa.
It was a wonderful experience.	Chay ruwayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
They are still the same today.	Kunankamapas chayna kachkanku.
I thought that would be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi kanman nispaymi piensarqani.
No one seemed to mind being there.	Manam pipas chaypi kasqanmantaqa mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
But you need to act quickly.	Ichaqa usqhayllan ruwanayki.
That’s what you want.	Chaytan munanki.
He had to do that.	Chaytaqa ruwanan karqan.
You’ll think about it.	Chaytaqa yuyaykunki.
That was very clear.	Chayqa ancha sut’inmi karqan.
He said he really was.	Payqa nirqam chiqaptapuni kasqanmanta.
Maybe there’s something there.	Ichapas chaypi imapas kanman.
I haven’t seen anyone yet.	Manaraqmi pitapas rikurqanichu.
But nothing like that happened, not really.	Ichaqa manan imapas chay hinachu karqan, manan cheqaqtachu.
He knew he could.	Payqa yacharqanmi atisqanmanta.
I would love to talk to you.	Anchatan munani qanwan rimayta.
Now, there is no one here.	Kunanqa, kaypiqa manam pipas kanchu.
That means all the time.	Chayqa tukuy tiempo niyta munan.
No one seems to know why.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu imanasqa chaytaqa.
I can’t do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atiymanchu.
But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
It’s going to be good.	Allinmi kanqa.
Nothing was right here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas allinchu karqa.
That’s really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi.
. . . .	.
Beautiful thing.	Sumaq imapas.
I know it was there.	Yachanim chaypi kasqanmanta.
I'll be fine there.	Allinmi chaypi kasaq.
The failure is not always a bad thing.	Chay mana allin ruwayqa manan sapa kutichu mana allinchu.
But he was alone.	Ichaqa sapallanmi kasqa.
But this would be interesting.	Ichaqa kayqa sumaqmi kanman.
Someone is here.	Pipas kaypi kachkan.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
This was a wonderful experience.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
It might be like this.	Yaqapaschá kay hina kanman.
It just isn’t.	Chaylla manachu.
The first is the first.	Ñawpaq kaq ñawpaq kaq.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan kayqa allinchu.
I never could.	Manam haykapipas atirqanichu.
It’s all beautiful.	Tukuy sumaqmi.
There is no one here.	Manam pipas kaypichu kachkan.
What is it now? 	¿Imataq kunan?
That’s really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi.
No more anyone else.	Manañam manaña pipas.
Like last night.	Qayna tuta hina.
I hope it’s a big success.	Suyachkani hatun allin kananpaq.
Better that way, better that way.	Aswan allin chayna, aswan allin chayna.
All right, all right, all right.	Allinmi, allinmi, allinmi.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Mana imapas kanchu.
You want to know more.	Astawan yachayta munanki.
He said, and so did I.	Payqa nisqa, ñuqapas.
But this isn’t the worst part.	Ichaqa manan kayqa aswan mana allinchu.
That is, today is a good day.	Chayqa, kunan punchawmi allin punchaw.
He said he didn’t care.	Payqa manan imananpaschu nispan nisqa.
I don’t want that to happen to him.	Manam munanichu paywan chayna kananta.
He wanted to tell her.	Payqa willayta munarqa.
It means you can’t do more than that.	Niyta munan mana chaymanta aswan ruwayta atiwaqchu.
I’m really excited.	Chiqaptam kusisqa kachkani.
I’m not a nobody.	Ñuqaqa mana pipas kani.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas manam allinchu.
That was the only thing.	Chayqa chaylla karqa.
He doesn’t care why.	Payqa manan imananpaschu imarayku.
He is a strong man.	Payqa sinchi runam.
The lonely man.	Sapallan runa.
I can’t do that.	Manam chaytaqa ruwaymanchu.
If if .	Sichus sichus .
I didn’t want to.	Manam munarqanichu.
It looks very good.	Ancha allinmi rikchakun.
It really does.	Chiqaptam ruwan.
It does a lot more.	Aswan achkatam ruwan.
He doesn't know what to do.	Payqa manan yachanchu ima ruwananta.
It’s not bad, but it’s not good.	Manam mana allinchu, ichaqa manam allinchu.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
It doesn’t matter though.	Manam imananpaschu ichaqa.
You think you are right.	Qamqa allintam nisqaykita yuyanki.
She was so beautiful.	Payqa llumpay sumaqmi karqa.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
But it doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan imananpaschu.
Being a human being.	Runa kaspa.
But, he really needs it.	Ichaqa, cheqaqtapunin necesitan.
. . . .	.
Some of the action was great.	Wakin ruwayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
Otherwise, nothing is wrong.	Mana chayqa, mana imapas mana allinchu.
I'm not sure what happened to this.	Manam segurochu kani kaymanta ima pasasqanmanta.
He was tired the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon sayk’usqa kasharqan.
I am almost too happy now.	Kunanqa yaqa llumpay kusisqam kachkani.
He had no idea what was going to happen to him today.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu kunan p’unchay imachus paywan pasananta.
He knows that’s the case.	Payqa yachanmi chayta.
I didn't think it would happen.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kananta.
He was a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaq runam karqa.
He knew how to do it.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna ruwayta.
But he is not alone.	Ichaqa manan sapallanchu kashan.
But I knew it would happen.	Ichaqa yacharqanim chayna kananta.
He’ll do it.	Payqa ruwanqa.
That’s what I am.	Chayna kani.
Maybe it was a good thing.	Ichapas allinmi karqa.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu ima kasqanmanta.
In fact, this makes it worse.	Chiqaptaqa kayqa aswan mana allintam ruwan.
It’s all good really.	Tukuy allinmi chiqaptapuni.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kasqa.
I'm there all day.	Tukuy punchawmi chaypi kachkani.
From being tired.	Sayk’usqa kaymanta.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
But nothing worked out.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu karqan.
But of course you do.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwanki.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I wish he would.	Munaymanmi chayta ruwananta.
I mean there will be three.	Kimsa kanqa nispaymi.
Now he can do nothing.	Kunanqa manam imatapas ruwayta atinchu.
I think, really, she’s wonderful.	Yuyaykuni, chiqaptapuni, payqa ancha sumaqmi.
I’m afraid that’s the case.	Manchakuni chayna kasqanmanta.
Yes, we are that good.	Arí, chayna allinmi kanchik.
This will fail.	Kayqa mana allintachu ruwanqa.
I didn’t always do that.	Manam sapa kutichu chayta ruwarqani.
Hopefully, it was good.	Munaymanmi, allinmi karqa.
He wasn’t up to it yet.	Payqa manaraqmi chayman hinachu kasqa.
That it wasn’t right.	Mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
But it had to be quick.	Ichaqa usqhayllan kanan karqan.
She could tell he was angry.	Payqa repararqanmi phiñasqa kashasqanmanta.
In fact, twenty to be exact.	Chiqaptaqa, iskay chunka chiqap kananpaq.
It’s really, really good.	Chiqap, chiqap allinmi.
It has always been huge.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi hatun hatun karqa.
He will not be alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu kanqa.
He was angry and sad.	Payqa phiñasqa, llakisqa ima kasqa.
I’m asking myself now.	Kunanmi tapukuni.
I don’t know what to do with him now.	Manam yachanichu kunan paywan ima ruwanayta.
But this is happening fast.	Ichaqa kayqa usqhayllan kashan.
It would probably do well.	Yaqapaschá allinta ruwanman.
But he had to do something.	Ichaqa imatapas ruwanan karqan.
He says everything is fine.	Payqa tukuy imapas allinmi nin.
But you can’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
He was probably nervous.	Payqa yaqapaschá mancharisqa kasharqan.
He used to .	Payqa ñawpaqtaqa .
I’m not sure what’s going to happen to him.	Manam segurochu kani imakuna paywan pasananta.
It’s a lot more interesting now.	Kunanqa aswan sumaqmi.
But maybe this was wrong.	Ichaqa ichapas kayqa mana allinchu karqa.
Today is a new day.	Kunan punchawmi musuq punchaw.
Not like a human being.	Mana runa hinachu.
A new reality.	Huk musuq chiqap.
But no one knows that.	Ichaqa manan pipas chaytaqa yachanchu.
Which is the least.	Imataq aswan pisi.
That’s what you know.	Chaytan yachanki.
I mean, it was all day.	Niyta munani, tukuy punchawmi karqa.
It would mean a lot.	Anchatam niyta munanman.
She’s beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi.
Monday was a bad day.	Lunes punchawqa mana allin punchawmi karqa.
This is going to be worse than that.	Kayqa chaymanta aswan mana allinmi kanqa.
Not sure why it works for you.	Mana segurochu imarayku qampaq allin kasqanmanta.
I want better.	Aswan allintam munani.
This wasn’t a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu karqa.
He knew this was tough.	Payqa yacharqanmi kayqa sinchi sasa kasqanmanta.
There is nothing here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas kanchu.
I knew today was going to be hard.	Yacharqanim kunan punchaw sasa kananta.
He certainly was.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin karqan.
He would be fine.	Payqa allinmi kanman.
Beautiful guy.	Sumaq runa.
That didn't seem right.	Chayqa mana allinchu rikchakurqa.
You are a beautiful person every day.	Sapa punchawmi sumaq runa kanki.
You don’t know anything about it.	Manam imatapas chaymantaqa yachankichu.
He seemed nervous.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam karqa.
He looked nervous.	Payqa mancharisqa hinam rikchakurqa.
He was always like that.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna karqa.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
I hope this is true.	Suyachkani kayqa chiqap kananpaq.
But it’s not quite right.	Ichaqa manan allintachu.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
He has always been better than me.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi ñuqamanta aswan allin karqa.
Nobody likes it.	Manam pipas gustanchu.
It wasn’t always that way.	Manam sapa kutichu chayna karqa.
There was so much of it.	Ancha achkatam karqa.
Maybe that’s what it should be.	Ichapas chayna kanan hina kanman.
That’s going to continue.	Chayqa hinallam kanqa.
I wanted to do it right.	Allintam ruwayta munarqani.
That wasn’t easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan.
I hope you don't.	Suyachkani mana chayta ruwanaykipaq.
He would be useful here.	Payqa kaypiqa allinmi kanman.
He is with us now.	Payqa kunanmi ñuqaykuwan kuska kachkan.
I always pretended to be angry with him.	Sapa kutim paywan phiñasqa hina ruwaq kani.
But he didn’t do it right.	Ichaqa manan chaytaqa allintachu ruwarqan.
Maybe there is something wrong with me.	Ichapas imapas mana allin ñuqawan kachkan.
What, man.	Imataq, runa.
This is a yes.	Kayqa arí.
Twenty or thirty will do just fine.	Iskay chunka kimsa chunka allinta ruwanqa.
I knew you could do it.	Yacharqanim chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
He seems very angry about it.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa hinam chaymanta.
He wanted it very much.	Payqa anchatam munarqa.
Not sure where though.	Mana segurochu maypi ichaqa.
No, actually.	Manam, chiqaptaqa.
Not here, he said.	Mana kaypichu, nispa.
I didn’t want to talk to him.	Manam paywan rimayta munarqanichu.
It can’t be any other way.	Manan huk hinachu kanman.
I’ve already said too much.	Ñam llumpayta nirqani.
I'm fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kachkani.
I’m not really sure.	Manam chiqaptaqa segurochu kani.
It was every day.	Sapa punchawmi karqa.
But not everything was so happy.	Ichaqa manan tukuy imapas chhayna kusisqachu karqan.
He always had something for you.	Payqa sapa kutim qampaq imapas karqa.
He can’t be alone in this.	Payqa manan kaypiqa sapallanchu kanman.
You want the wrong thing.	Mana allintam munanki.
But this will obviously fail.	Ichaqa kayqa sut’inmi mana allintachu ruwanqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
This is not the case.	Kayqa manam.
He doesn’t know about anything.	Payqa manan imamantapas yachanchu.
But it’s not that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu.
He must act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan ruwanan.
Maybe that would be a good thing.	Ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
That would be really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi kanman.
He doesn’t have much.	Payqa manan anchatachu.
But nothing is right.	Ichaqa manan imapas allinchu.
It just doesn't seem right.	Chaylla mana allinchu rikchakun.
They are very tough.	Paykunaqa ancha sinchitan kanku.
Not sure what happened.	Mana segurochu imakuna pasasqanmanta.
I mean, really, really good.	Niyta munani, chiqap, chiqap allin.
But maybe it is.	Ichaqa ichapas chayna kanman.
I think that is very wrong.	Chayqa ancha mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
He said he really liked it.	Payqa anchatam gustasqanmanta nirqa.
One by one, one by one.	Hukmanta hukmanta.
He seemed fine.	Payqa allintam rikchakurqa.
Indeed he was.	Chiqaptam payqa karqa.
For what he did.	Chay ruwasqanmanta.
But he was afraid.	Ichaqa mancharisqa kasharqan.
I didn’t know that.	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu.
It was really great.	Chiqaptam ancha hatun karqa.
I didn’t know what to say.	Mana yacharqanichu ima niyta.
You think that it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam yuyanki.
That’s what it looked like.	Chayqa rikchakurqa.
That doesn’t make it any better.	Chayqa manan aswan allintachu ruwan.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
He was happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqa kasqa.
He knew they weren't now.	Payqa yacharqanmi kunan mana kasqankuta.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
I mean everything.	Tukuy imatam niyta munani.
You're tired of it.	Sayk'usqa kanki.
I’ve done that.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani.
I can’t help it.	Manam yanapayta atiymanchu.
You were the best.	Aswan allinmi karqanki.
I think it was the third.	Kimsa kaq kasqanmantam piensani.
That’s still the case.	Chayqa hinallam kachkan.
If anyone can do this.	Pipas kayta ruwayta atinman chayqa.
He didn't do well here.	Kaypiqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
This was not going to be easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu kanan karqa.
She said, yes please.	Payqa nisqa, arí ama hina kaspa.
That’s, nothing.	Chayqa, manam imapas.
This should be really interesting.	Kayqa chiqap sumaqmi kanan.
The new one wasn’t good enough.	Musuq mana allinchu karqa.
It could very well be true.	Ancha allintam chiqap kanman.
But he didn’t think about it.	Ichaqa manan yuyaykurqanchu.
I never thought he would.	Manam haykapipas piensarqanichu chaynata ruwananta.
Maybe a little less.	Ichapas huk chikan pisi.
This is a good thing.	Kayqa allinmi.
He was tired and sad.	Payqa sayk’usqa, llakisqa ima kasqa.
It was really nice.	Chiqap sumaqmi karqa.
I don’t mean to say.	Manam niyta munanichu.
It would be quick.	Utqaylla kanman.
That lasted about a week.	Chayqa yaqa huk semanan karqan.
But it is not certain.	Ichaqa manan segurochu.
It wasn’t very good.	Manam ancha allinchu karqa.
A cup of coffee.	Huk kukata.
I’m really excited.	Chiqaptam kusisqa kachkani.
What is it with him?.	¿Imataq paywan kachkan?.
But of course this is wrong.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin kayqa mana allinchu.
Can't say for sure.	Mana seguro niyta atinchu.
This is the process.	Kay ruwayqa.
Probably not, but it looks like it.	Manapaschá, ichaqa chayman rikchakun.
Now was the time.	Kunanmi chay tiempo karqan.
He was injured.	Payqa k’irisqa kasharqan.
This would not be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman.
I can’t beat it.	Manam atipayta atiymanchu.
He is such a good guy.	Payqa chayna allin runam.
Here’s a little bit.	Kaypi huk chikan.

Bigger, actually.	Aswan hatun, chiqaptaqa.
I’m afraid it’s going to be bad.	Manchakuni mana allin kananta.
I want to do a lot.	Achkatam ruwayta munani.
But he said yes.	Ichaqa arí nisqa.
The right thing to do.	Allin kaq.

Hopefully more than one.	Munaymanmi aswan hukmanta.
They certainly are.	Cheqaqtapunin chay hina kanku.
It’s okay with me.	Allinmi ñuqawanqa.
Yes, that would be a good thing.	Arí, chayqa allinmi kanman.
He wasn’t like that.	Payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
That’s a very good thing to say.	Chayqa ancha allin nisqa.
He doesn't want anything.	Manam imatapas munanchu.
That will make it better.	Chayqa aswan allintan ruwanqa.
Two, maybe three years.	Iskay, ichapas kimsa wata.
I didn’t see that.	Manam chaytaqa rikurqanichu.
Very, very scared.	Ancha, ancha mancharisqa.
I didn’t do it right.	Manam allintachu ruwarqani.
Obviously, he wasn’t.	Sut’inmi, payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
I never saw anyone.	Manam haykapipas pitapas rikurqanichu.
He knew what he wanted.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima munasqanmanta.
I thought you wanted to know.	Yachayta munasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
Maybe he wants to talk about it.	Ichapas chaymanta rimayta munan.
He would be good alone.	Payqa sapallanmi allin kanman.
He was alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kasqa.
I made a cup of coffee.	Huk kukata ruwarqani.
That is, if you will.	Chayqa, munaspaqa.
More about this.	Astawan kaymanta.
Bad, bad, and bad.	Mana allin, mana allin, mana allin ima.
But he refused to go.	Ichaqa manan riyta munarqanchu.
He thought nothing of it.	Payqa manan imatapas yuyaykurqanchu.
There is nothing about it.	Chaymantaqa manam imapas kanchu.
No, he doesn’t like it.	Manan, payqa manan gustanchu.
He wants to go every day.	Payqa sapa punchawmi riyta munan.
You don’t quite know yet.	Manaraqmi allintachu yachanki.
That was probably not a good thing.	Chayqa yaqapaschá mana allinchu karqan.
He was in a deep state of distress.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan.
He was a great guy.	Hatun runa kasqa.
Yes, it was a bad thing.	Arí, mana allinmi karqa.
That was obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi karqan.
He realized that.	Chaytaqa repararqanmi.
But no, it wasn’t.	Ichaqa manan, manan chay hinachu karqan.
But that’s that.	Ichaqa chay chayta.
I’m not quite sure, but .	Manam allintachu yachani, ichaqa .
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
Maybe you should do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanayki.
He doesn't want to do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwayta munanchu.
Maybe it doesn’t exist.	Ichapas mana kanchu.
I never thought it was that good.	Manam haykapipas chayna allin kasqanmantaqa piensarqanichu.
That something was wrong with him.	Paywan imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
He knows how to do it.	Payqa yachanmi imayna ruwayta.
But no, probably not.	Ichaqa manan, yaqapaschá mana.
He says he’s right.	Payqa ninmi.
Not another.	Mana huk.
Obviously it’s not good.	Sut’inmi mana allinchu.
Even today.	Kunankamapas.
Certain.	Wakin.
Which is great, obviously.	Imataq hatun, sut’inmi.
But it won’t be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanqa.
That was supposed to be.	Chayqa kanan karqan.
You were badly hurt.	Sinchitan k’irisqa karqanki.
He would have to do it.	Payqa ruwanan kanman karqan.
Everything seemed fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakurqa.
I was so nervous and scared.	Ancha mancharisqa, mancharisqa ima karqani.
That was something interesting.	Chayqa imapas sumaqmi karqa.
He went fast, fast.	Payqa utqaylla, utqaylla rirqa.
But he did it very quickly.	Ichaqa ancha usqhayllan chayta ruwarqan.
Every day doesn't seem easy.	Sapa punchawqa manam facilchu hinachu kachkan.
I just can’t figure out why.	Chaylla mana yachayta atinichu imarayku chayta.
It was almost a good thing.	Yaqa allinmi karqa.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
That it’s actually not good enough.	Chiqaptaqa mana allinchu kasqanmanta.
That shouldn’t be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanan.
But I don’t know.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu.
It’s good, though.	Allinmi ichaqa.
That’s what you know.	Chaytan yachanki.
He didn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa munarqanchu.
He will certainly be.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kanqa.
You don’t know what it is yet.	Manaraqmi yachankichu ima kasqanmantaqa.
He really wanted to talk to you.	Payqa anchatan qanwan rimayta munarqan.
Nobody cares here.	Kaypiqa manam pipas imananpaschu.
There’s just nothing left.	Chaylla manaña imapas kanchu.
I'll do it quickly.	Utqaylla ruwasaq.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqan.
Something wrong, very wrong.	Imapas mana allin, ancha mana allin.
I know it doesn't really matter.	Yachanim mana chiqaptachu imapas kasqanmanta.
He is probably very happy.	Payqa yaqapaschá ancha kusisqa kashan.
Now you know it.	Kunanmi yachanki.
In fact, it’s great.	Chiqaptaqa, ancha allinmi.
But I don’t like it.	Ichaqa manan gustanchu.
Pretend you’re not with us.	Mana ñuqaykuwan kasqaykita hina ruway.
He isn’t feeling well.	Payqa manam allinchu kachkan.
That’s the kind of thing.	Chay hina ruway.
I don’t want to say it anymore.	Manañam niyta munanichu.
This was a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi karqa.
He’s not a good guy.	Payqa mana allinchu.
You are a good person, after all.	Allin runam kanki, tukuy imamanta.
I know no one else can.	Yachanim mana pipas atisqanmanta.
He didn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa munarqanchu.
I’m very tired.	Ancha sayk’usqa kani.
That ? 	Chay ?
It’s a good one.	Allinmi kachkan.
Yes, she is beautiful.	Arí, payqa sumaqmi.
I know there are many.	Yachanim achka kasqanmanta.
That was obviously wrong.	Chay ruwayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu karqan.
That lasted about two weeks.	Chayqa yaqa iskay semana hinam karqa.
It will be quick.	Utqaylla kanqa.
He still does that today.	Kunankamapas chaytan ruwan.
I didn’t think you could do this.	Manam yuyaykurqanichu kayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
All the time, maybe.	Tukuy tiempo, ichapas.
He had to do it alone.	Payqa sapallanmi chayta ruwanan karqan.
Yes, it is good.	Arí allinmi.
He’s not really there.	Payqa manan cheqaqtachu chaypi kashan.
But he couldn’t do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
The man went with us.	Chay runam ñuqaykuwan rirqa.
They are like new.	Musuq hinam kanku.
But that wouldn’t be the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chayqa allinchu kanman.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
But it’s not yet.	Ichaqa manaraqmi.
The really great one.	Chiqap hatun kaq.
He’s great, but he’s very .	Payqa ancha allinmi, ichaqa ancha .
He couldn’t speak.	Payqa manan rimayta atirqanchu.
The most difficult part.	Aswan sasa kaq.
Maybe that would be a good thing.	Ichapas chayqa allin kanman.
I’m not good enough for you.	Manam qampaq allinchu kani.
This would not be a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman.
That wasn’t a bad thing.	Chayqa manam mana allinchu karqa.
That’s nothing really.	Chayqa manan imapas cheqaqtachu.
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.
There is no one.	Manam pipas kanchu.
He can’t do that.	Mana chayta ruwayta atinchu.
Maybe they’re better off without me.	Ichapas mana ñuqawanqa aswan allin kachkanku.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
Every day was great.	Sapa punchawmi ancha allin karqa.
I don’t know any other language.	Manam huk rimayta yachanichu.
I am well aware of that.	Chaymantaqa allintam yachani.
I certainly did it.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwarqani.
But he said that it was.	Ichaqa chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.
Nothing was right here.	Kaypiqa manam imapas allinchu karqa.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Perhaps no one knows.	Manapaschá pipas yachanchu.
No, it’s never that simple.	Manan, manan hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu.
Beautiful, hurt, and angry.	Sumaq, k’irisqa, phiñasqa ima.
But everything was as it should be.	Ichaqa tukuy imapas imayna kanan hinam karqa.
Everything would be fine saying.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanman nispa nispa.
I probably should have.	Yaqapaschá chayta ruwanay karqan.
He wasn’t sure at all.	Payqa manan imapipas segurochu kasqa.
He is always there for you.	Payqa sapa kutim qampaq kachkan.
No! 	Manam!
The great thing is.	Hatun kaq.
It had been a very long time now.	Kunanqa ancha unayñan kasqa.
But of course it does.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chaytaqa ruwan.
I know that for sure.	Chaytaqa allintam yachani.
This means that if you are a nice person.	Kayqa niyta munan, sichus sumaq runa kanki chayqa.
He still wasn't sure.	Payqa manaraqmi segurochu kasqa.
But it’s not that simple anymore.	Ichaqa manañan chay hina facilchu.
He couldn’t believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
I'm not sure what happened.	Manam segurochu kani ima pasasqanmanta.
One day, one day .	Huk punchaw, huk punchaw .
I’m a human being.	Ñuqaqa runam kani.
It was obvious.	Sut’inmi karqan.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
Now forgive me.	Kunanqa pampachaykuway.
But no, he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan, manan atirqanchu.
He was angry and scared.	Payqa phiñasqa mancharisqa ima kasqa.
No, that's not a good thing.	Manan chayqa manan allinchu.
I would like to.	Munaymanmi.
But of course it does.	Ichaqa sut’inmi chayta ruwan.
It may not be the case.	Manapaschá chay hinachu kanman.
They are now.	Paykunaqa kunanmi kanku.
Very excited.	Ancha kusisqa.
He did it all the time.	Payqa sapa kutim chaytaqa ruwaq.
That’s two years.	Chayqa iskay wata.
I didn’t do very well.	Manam anchatachu allinta ruwarqani.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Maybe it’s better.	Ichapas aswan allin kanman.
Yes, it was a great experience.	Arí, ancha allinmi karqa.
I should have done this the other day.	Ñawpaq p'unchawmi kayta ruwanay karqan.
I didn’t know this would happen.	Manam yacharqanichu kay pasananta.
I don’t think he can do that.	Mana chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta yuyani.
I can't work now.	Kunanqa manam llamkayta atiymanchu.
. . . .	.
That might not be such a bad thing.	Chayqa manapaschá chhayna mana allinchu kanman.
He knew he could do it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwayta atisqanmanta.
Then, maybe, something else.	Chaymanta, ichapas, huk imapas.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
He should be very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kanan.
I’m not sure about this yet.	Manaraqmi kaymanta segurochu kani.
Very very much.	Ancha ancha.
Here, do this.	Kaypi, kayta ruway.
Maybe too big.	Ichapas ancha hatun.
Obviously, it’s not.	Sut’inmi, manan chay hinachu.
But it was like always.	Ichaqa sapa kuti hinan karqan.
I think this is wrong.	Kayqa mana allin kasqanmantam piensani.
I know that it is not.	Yachanim mana chayna kasqanmanta.
But it was still there.	Ichaqa hinallam karqa.
It is better than everything and nothing.	Tukuy imamanta, mana imamantapas aswan allinmi.
There is nothing I can do here.	Kaypiqa manam imatapas ruwayta atiymanchu.
But things weren't quite right here.	Ichaqa kaypiqa manam imapas allintachu karqa.
No, everything is fine.	Manan, tukuy imapas allinmi.
He said, 'It's.	Payqa nirqam.
He was pretty sure of that.	Payqa allintam chaymantaqa seguro karqa.
Don’t you think so?.	¿Manachu yuyanki?.
Being that person.	Chay runa kay.
Looks like it will continue.	Hinallam kanqa hinam rikchakun.
But of course you know all about it.	Ichaqa sut’inmi tukuy chaymanta yachanki.
He wanted to do that.	Chayta ruwayta munarqa.
Sure about it.	Seguro chaymanta.
Inappropriate.	Manam allinchu.
That seemed nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
It’s all there.	Tukuy chaypi kachkan.
Not sure why though.	Ichaqa manan segurochu imarayku chayta.
I'm not here, actually.	Manam kaypichu kachkani, chiqaptaqa.
I mean, it’s there.	Niyta munani, chaypi kachkan.
I wish it was.	Munaymanmi chayna kasqanmanta.
That’s right, you guys.	Chayqa allinmi, qamqa.
Yes that’s good.	Arí chay allin.
I think he was worried about me.	Yuyaykuni ñuqamanta llakisqa kasqanmanta.
Nothing is right.	Manam imapas allinchu.
Too many, in fact.	Ancha achka, chiqaptaqa.
Yes, he certainly is.	Arí, payqa cheqaqtapunin chay hina kashan.
He has been there since ten.	Payqa chunka ñawpaqmantaraqmi chaypi kachkan.
He doesn’t exist.	Payqa manam kanchu.
But that’s a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa allinmi.
He was very curious.	Payqa anchatam yachayta munarqa.
That's a lot of	Chayqa ancha .
This obviously doesn’t seem right.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu rikch’akun.
He knows what this is like.	Payqa yachanmi kay imayna kasqanmanta.
You know that’s what you know.	Chayta yachanki.
What's in it.	Imataq chaypi kachkan.
He wanted to be sure of everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta seguro kayta munarqan.
Probably so well.	Yaqapaschá chayna allinta.
No one wants it now.	Kunanqa manam pipas munanchu.
He was badly injured.	Payqa sinchitan k’irisqa karqan.
Do whatever you can.	Imapas atisqaykita ruway.
He didn’t want to do that.	Payqa manan chayta ruwayta munarqanchu.
Never more, once less.	Mana hayk’aqpas aswan, huk kuti pisi.
But it looked good.	Ichaqa allinmi rikchakurqa.

He was really angry.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin phiñasqa kasharqan.
A good man does that.	Allin runam chayta ruwan.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
That is as it should be.	Chayqa imayna kanan hinam.
That’s not always the case.	Chayqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna.
Then the big one.	Chaymanta hatun kaq.
Three times faster.	Kimsa kuti aswan utqaylla.
I’m the same.	Ñuqapas kani.
No, you can’t do that.	Manan, manan chaytaqa ruwayta atiwaqchu.
He had to act quickly.	Payqa usqhayllan imatapas ruwanan karqan.
What’s the answer?.	¿Imaynataq chaymanta?.
In fact, it’s worse than that.	Chiqaptaqa, chaymantaqa aswan mana allinmi.
This is the best.	Kayqa aswan allinmi.
Something that is sometimes uncomfortable.	Imapas wakin kuti mana allin kaq.
It's all very clear now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas ancha sut'inmi.
You were happy.	Kusisqam karqanki.
He's obviously there.	Payqa sut'inmi kashan.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
I ask myself that question all the time.	Sapa kutim chayta tapukuni.
What a great guy.	Ima hatun runa.
Too much of anything can go wrong.	Llumpay imapas mana allinchu kanman.
He looked very unhappy.	Payqa ancha mana kusisqam rikchakurqa.
It didn’t seem right.	Manam allinchu rikchakurqa.
I couldn’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atirqanichu.
That’s the most interesting thing.	Chayqa aswan sumaqmi.
But things aren't quite right yet.	Ichaqa imapas manaraqmi allinchu kachkan.
That may not have been a good thing.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu karqan.
He does, how.	Payqa ruwan, imaynatataq.
That's today, actually.	Chayqa kunan punchawmi, chiqaptaqa.
He doesn’t have time.	Payqa manan tiempon kanchu.
No one knows how long the process could take.	Manan pipas yachanchu hayk’a tiempo chay ruwayqa kanman chayta.
Otherwise it might not be much.	Mana chayqa manapaschá anchatachu kanman.
He did a very good job.	Payqa ancha allintam ruwarqa.
. . . .	.
Yes, it’s his real name.	Arí, chiqap sutinmi.
Maybe you’re scared.	Ichapas mancharisqa kachkanki.
But it wasn’t easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu karqan.
It’s pretty nice.	Allin sumaqmi.
This thing did it.	Kay imapas ruwarqa.
I don’t know why this would be.	Mana yachanichu imarayku kay kanman.
But it was a good one.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan.
. . . .	.
That means so much.	Chayqa ancha achkatam niyta munan.
I know this is true.	Yachanim kayqa chiqap kasqanmanta.
They are a human being.	Paykunaqa huk runam.
He was always there.	Payqa sapa kutim chaypi karqa.
I had to do it right.	Chaytaqa allintam ruwanay karqa.
If it does, that’s great.	Sichus chayta ruwan chayqa, chayqa ancha allinmi.
But this is not the case.	Ichaqa kayqa manan chay hinachu.
It’s all right!.	¡Tukuy allinmi!.
You can’t do anything about it.	Manan imatapas ruwayta atiwaqchu.
That’s not going to be a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu kanqa.
But it’s a lot more interesting than that.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa aswan sumaqmi.
This was a great day.	Kayqa hatun punchawmi karqa.
If anyone can help.	Sichus pipas yanapayta atinman chayqa.
Maybe more depressed.	Ichapas aswan llakisqa.
I mean that in a better way.	Chaytaqa aswan allinta niyta munani.
I just pretended not to.	Mana chayta ruwanaypaq hinallam ruwarqani.
He probably would have.	Yaqapaschá chaytaqa ruwanman karqan.
It’s obviously very successful.	Sut’inmi ancha allinta ruwasqanmanta.
That, that’s all.	Chay, chaylla.
You really have to do something.	Cheqaqtapunin imatapas ruwanayki.
It was a good day.	Allin punchawmi karqa.
But this one pretty much did it.	Ichaqa kayqa yaqapaschá chayta ruwarqan.
Still not the worst.	Hinallam mana aswan mana allinchu.
That’s a very good thing for you.	Chayqa ancha allinmi qampaq.
He wouldn’t be alone anymore.	Manañan sapallanchu kanman karqan.
He’s the one.	Payqa.
He doesn’t seem upset at all.	Payqa manan imapipas phiñasqa hinachu kashan.
But this doesn’t matter.	Ichaqa manan kayqa imananpaschu.
I don’t know why.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa.
I don’t really want to do that.	Manam anchatachu chayta ruwayta munani.
It's very similar here.	Kaypiqa anchatam rikchakun.
They are the ones.	Paykunaqa kachkanku.
He doesn’t want to, he said.	Manam munanchu, nispa.
I’m wondering, too.	Ñuqapas tapukuni.
He didn’t know you could do that.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu chayta ruwayta atisqaykita.
This looked interesting.	Kayqa sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
Did you know that.	Yacharqankichu.
I’m not really into it.	Manam chiqaptaqa chayman hinachu kachkani.
Almost everything else.	Yaqa tukuy imamanta.
It doesn’t matter to anyone.	Manam pimanpas imananpaschu.
He did not yet know how that would be.	Imayna chay kanman chaytaqa manaraqmi yacharqanchu.
He seems happy.	Payqa kusisqa hinam kachkan.
I am much better now.	Kunanqa aswan allinmi kani.
He was better than this.	Payqa kaymanta aswan allinmi karqa.
But it didn’t work out.	Ichaqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
He was pretty sure he knew.	Payqa allintan seguro kasharqan yachasqanmanta.
I mean, it’s fine.	Niyta munani, allinmi.
That didn’t mean it.	Chayqa manan niyta munarqanchu.
But I think you’re right.	Ichaqa allinmi kasqaykita yuyaykuni.
I mean, that’s what I mean.	Chayta niyta munani.
That’s what it does.	Chaytan ruwan.
The best part of it.	Aswan allin kaq.
But I don’t want to do that.	Ichaqa manan chayta ruwayta munanichu.
But he looked hard.	Ichaqa sinchitan qhawarirqan.
But it’s not here.	Ichaqa manan kaypichu kashan.
That’s a good thing, not a bad thing.	Chayqa allinmi, manam mana allinchu.
He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manan allintachu ruwarqan.
You have to do this.	Kayta ruwanayki tiyan.
Then you’re going to.	Chaymantaqa qamqa.
You should do this regularly.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim ruwanayki.
He was still there.	Payqa hinallam karqa.
It wasn’t as good as it used to be.	Manam ñawpaq hinachu allin karqa.
But he is not here now.	Ichaqa manan kunanqa kaypichu kashan.
Everyone is there.	Lliwmi chaypi kachkanku.
He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi karqa.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
They are very secure.	Paykunaqa ancha segurom kanku.
This process is still inadequate.	Kay ruwayqa kunankamapas mana allinchu kachkan.
No one took it seriously.	Manan pipas chaytaqa allintachu qhawarirqan.
I know why you are here.	Yachanim imanasqa kaypi kasqaykita.
Otherwise, he would be alone.	Mana chayqa, sapallanmi kanman.
It was all there.	Tukuy chaypi kasqa.
It’s not easy at all.	Manan imapipas facilchu.
I question everything.	Tukuy imatam tapukuni.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
It was like a day.	Huk punchaw hinam karqa.
Nothing seemed right.	Manam imapas allin hinachu rikchakurqa.
Tomorrow, he might do something.	Paqarin, imatapas ruwanman.
I know what it is.	Yachanim ima kasqanmanta.
He said that it was.	Chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.
What a good guy.	Ima allin runa.
But then everything was fine.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
I know that is wrong.	Chayqa mana allin kasqanmantam yachani.
Yes, you are right.	Arí, allintam chaytaqa ruwanki.

I don't know why that is.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa chayna kasqanmanta.
But one day you will succeed.	Ichaqa huk punchawmi allinta ruwanki.
He couldn’t do that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.
Success is not certain.	Allin ruwayqa manan segurochu.
He couldn’t do that before.	Payqa manan ñawpaqtaqa chayta ruwayta atirqanchu.
He was really bad.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin mana allin karqan.
But this was not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
Nothing more than that.	Mana imapas aswan chaymantaqa.
But you’re beautiful.	Ichaqa sumaqmi kanki.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
I know you are worried.	Yachanim llakisqa kasqaykita.

He knows what you are.	Payqa yachanmi ima kasqaykita.
Not bad, not good.	Mana mana allinchu, mana allinchu.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.

You want to buy more.	Astawan rantiyta munanki.
Yes, such a person.	Arí, chayna runa.

I don’t think of it any other way.	Manam huk hinachu piensani.
I thought you were someone else.	Huk runa kasqaykita yuyaykurqani.
He knows what you need to do.	Payqa yachanmi imatapas ruwanaykita.
No one could do this right.	Manan pipas kayta allinta ruwayta atirqanchu.

Do, please, anything.	Ruway, ama, imatapas.
I really want that.	Chaytaqa anchatam munani.

I think that's good for you.	Chayqa qampaq allin kasqanmantam piensani.
That should be everything.	Chayqa tukuy imapas kanan.
Maybe they're a little too fast.	Ichapas huk chikan llumpay utqaylla kachkanku.
That is always a bad thing.	Chayqa sapa kutim mana allinchu.
Maybe a little too well though.	Ichapas huk chikan ancha allinta ichaqa.
He wanted it very badly.	Ancha mana allintam munarqa.
But before that.	Ichaqa manaraq chaymanta.
I happily said yes.	Kusisqam arí nirqani.
You’re human, that’s all.	Runa kanki, chaylla.

That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu karqan.
But it may not be the case.	Ichaqa manapaschá hinachu kanman.
I was almost excited.	Yaqapaschá kusisqa karqani.
He certainly did.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
But this is a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa allinmi.
But it doesn’t seem to be that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu kanman hina.
You’re a good guy.	Allin runam kanki.
Better than that.	Aswan allin chaymanta.

I wish he would come over.	Munaymanmi chayman hamunanta.
Very new fact.	Ancha musuq chiqap.
He couldn’t face this now.	Payqa manan kunanqa kayta atipayta atirqanchu.
He knew how to do it, but he couldn’t do it.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna ruwayta, ichaqa manan ruwayta atirqanchu.
That was very clear last year.	Chayqa ancha sut’inmi karqan qayna wata.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
A lot, he said.	Achka, nispa.
I don't know why this happened.	Manam yachanichu imanasqa kay pasasqanmanta.
It’s very nice.	Ancha sumaqmi.
There is no other way to do it.	Manam huk ruwayqa kanchu.
Couldn’t be happier!.	¡Manan aswan kusisqa kayta atinmanchu!.
I was just so tired.	Chayraqmi ancha sayk'usqa karqani.
Then it will do the action.	Chaymantaqa ruwayta ruwanqa.
But he was here yesterday.	Ichaqa qayna punchawmi kaypi karqa.
I didn’t know anything.	Manam imatapas yacharqanichu.
He was devastated and depressed.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa, llakisqa ima kasharqan.
I wish I could avoid that.	Chayta mana ruwanaypaqmi munani.
This approach can be useful.	Kay ruwayqa allinmi kanman.
I really want that.	Chaytaqa anchatam munani.
He was right with her.	Payqa allintam paywan karqa.
You’re a bad guy.	Mana allin runam kanki.
But it wasn’t that simple.	Ichaqa manan chay hina facilchu karqan.
That it’s just not the greatest thing.	Chaylla mana aswan hatun kaq kasqanmanta.
Nothing is certain.	Manan imapas segurochu.
I'm sure everything will be fine.	Seguro kani tukuy imapas allin kananta.

You just didn't know that was true.	Chaylla mana yacharqankichu chay chiqap kasqanmanta.
You’re not good enough.	Manam allinchu kanki.
I am not sure what happened.	Manam segurochu kani imakuna pasasqanmanta.
He doesn't know what's wrong.	Payqa manam yachanchu ima mana allin kasqanmantaqa.
I thought it was good.	Ñuqaqa allin kasqanmantam piensarqani.
You’re a good guy.	Allinmi kanki.
Everything was wonderful.	Tukuy imapas sumaqmi karqa.
Actually, he was right.	Chiqaptaqa, payqa allintam nirqa.
I'm not sure.	Manam segurochu kani.
Everything went well.	Tukuy imapas allintam rirqa.
I wasn’t good enough.	Manam allinchu karqani.
It's really not that bad to do.	Chiqaptaqa manam chayna mana allinchu ruwayqa.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
That has always been the case.	Ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqa.
That’s a good thing though.	Chayqa allinmi ichaqa.
I was happy to be there.	Kusisqam karqani.
Nothing now.	Mana imapas kunanqa.
But he doesn’t want to.	Ichaqa manan munanchu.
I want to, too.	Ñuqapas munani.
But really, it won't work.	Ichaqa chiqaptaqa, manam allinchu kanqa.
The worst part of it.	Aswan mana allin kaq.
He does something.	Payqa imatapas ruwan.
You will find out one day.	Chaytaqa huk punchawmi yachanki.
It’s now.	Kunanmi.
Now I did it.	Kunanqa ruwarqani.
I want to know how and why he did it.	Imayna ruwasqanmanta, imarayku ruwasqanmanta yachayta munani.
She is very nice as always.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi sapa kuti hina.
But it doesn’t seem that bad.	Ichaqa manan chay hina mana allinchu rikch’akun.
He said it over and over and over again.	Chaytaqa sapa kutim sapa kutim nirqa.
To be with him.	Paywan kuska kananpaq.
Do more than that.	Chaymanta astawan ruway.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
Here, he can’t.	Kaypiqa, manam atinchu.
It may have been a while.	Yaqapaschá huk tiempo karqan.
Perhaps he wants to buy time.	Yaqapaschá tiempota rantiyta munan.
I mean he was worried.	Payqa llakisqa kasqanmantam niyta munani.
But this seems excessive.	Ichaqa kayqa llumpay hinam.
This is obviously wrong.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.
What would be wrong with it.	Imataq mana allin kanman.
I'd be nice.	Sumaqmi kayman.
Not about anything.	Mana imamanta.
He did as he was told.	Nisqanman hinam ruwarqa.
Not as happy as before.	Mana ñawpaq hinachu ancha kusisqa.
But you're going to get hurt.	Ichaqa k'irisqa kanki.
It will be safe, all right.	Seguro kanqa, allinmi.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
Very good indeed.	Ancha allin chiqap.
He had been like that for a long time.	Payqa unayñan chhayna kasqa.
Maybe that’s all he really wants.	Ichapas chaylla chiqaptapuni munan.
She was beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi karqa.
That’s a very good thing.	Chayqa ancha allinmi.
I don’t want to.	Manam munanichu.
He doesn’t want to.	Payqa manam munanchu.
He was pretty sure of that.	Payqa yaqapaschá chaymanta seguro kasharqan.
That’s the big reason why.	Chay hatun imarayku.
Not sure what's wrong.	Mana segurochu ima mana allin kasqanmanta.
I probably said that.	Yaqapaschá chayta nirqani.
But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.
He wants to go with you.	Qanwan riyta munan.
I know that for sure.	Chaytaqa allintam yachani.
I used to be happy.	Ñawpaqtaqa kusisqam karqani.
Then, the second one.	Chaymanta, iskay kaq.
Almost inhumanly so.	Yaqa mana runa hina chayna.
That’s a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinmi.
No one wants that.	Manam pipas chayta munanchu.
I just wanted him to leave.	Chaylla munarqani ripunanpaq.
I know that he did.	Yachanim chayna ruwasqanmanta.

No, never, never.	Manan, mana hayk’aqpas, mana hayk’aqpas.
I don’t know not to work.	Manam yachanichu mana llamkayta.

He acted like a very scared person.	Payqa ancha mancharisqa runa hinam ruwarqa.
That seemed too good to be true.	Chayqa ancha allinmi rikchakurqa mana chiqap kananpaq.
I know what it’s like.	Yachanim imayna kasqanmanta.

I’m glad to be with you.	Kusikuni qanwan kaspa.
I'm pretty sure no one could say that.	Yaqa segurom kani mana pipas chay niyta atisqanmanta.
The process can take some time.	Chay ruwayqa huk tiempon kanman.
That 's	Chayqa .
But first, some background.	Ichaqa ñawpaqtaqa wakin ñawpaqmantaraqmi.
But not for very long.	Ichaqa manan ancha unaytachu.
It still does, in fact.	Hinallam ruwan, chiqaptaqa.
But, not sure how about that.	Ichaqa, mana segurochu imaynatachus chaymanta.
He doesn’t like it.	Payqa manam gustanchu.
He was like that.	Payqa hinan karqan.
I wish it were the case.	Munaymanmi chayna kananta.
That seemed to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi rikchakurqa.
Someone must be a non-performer.	Pipas mana ruwaq runa kanan.
I mean, yeah, please.	Niyta munani, arí, ama hina kaspa.

He didn’t know how he knew that, but he did.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu imaynatachus chayta yachasqanmanta, ichaqa yacharqanmi.
I wish you could.	Munaymanmi atisqaykita.
I thought that was a pretty good move.	Chayqa allin allin ruway kasqanmantam piensarqani.
How? 	Imayna?
I thought, now it will have to be someone else.	Yuyarqanim, kunanqa huk runam kanan kanqa.
But it’s not the best.	Ichaqa manan aswan allinchu.
It’s okay with me.	Allinmi ñuqawan.
Something is certainly right here.	Cheqaqtapunin kaypi imapas allin kashan.
Tougher now.	Aswan sinchi kunan.
He said that it was.	Chayna kasqanmantam nirqa.
I really am a very nice person.	Chiqaptam ancha sumaq runa kani.
But he knew he would.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi chay ruwananta.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
No one was quite sure.	Manam pipas allintachu seguro karqa.
He should be happy.	Payqa kusisqa kanan.
Like, like now.	Imayna, kunan hina.
I wonder if that’s the case.	Tapukuni sichus chayna kanman chayta.
One day is like another.	Huk punchawmi huk punchaw hina.
It was a great year.	Hatun wata karqan.
It was a good day.	Allin punchawmi karqa.
He knew the consequences.	Payqa yacharqanmi chaymanta imakuna kananta.
I was afraid to tell anyone.	Pimanpas willayta mancharisqa karqani.

Do what you do, everything you do.	Ruway ruwasqaykita, tukuy ruwasqaykita.

But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
If you don’t want to know this.	Kayta mana yachayta munaspaqa.
He’s not happy.	Manam kusisqachu.
But that wouldn’t be the right thing to do.	Ichaqa manan chay ruwayqa allinchu kanman.
No, that wasn’t a good thing.	Manan, chayqa manan allinchu karqan.
He didn’t want to do that.	Chaytaqa manan ruwayta munarqanchu.
It just wouldn’t be right.	Chaylla mana allinchu kanman.

You don’t know.	Mana yachankichu.

What’s the best thing.	Imataq aswan allin.

Okay, never mind.	Allinmi, mana haykapipas.

It’s bad, sometimes.	Mana allinmi, wakin kuti.
No, he doesn't.	Manan payqa manan.

That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.

Nothing went right.	Manam imapas allintachu rirqa.
Maybe it should be.	Ichapas chayna kanan.
But I didn’t make it into a big deal.	Ichaqa manan hatun ruwaymanchu ruwarqani.
That’s what he wants.	Chaytan payqa munan.
He couldn’t say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas niyta atirqanchu.
There was an injury.	Huk k’irisqa karqan.
You know, in this city .	Yachanki, kay llaqtapi .

He can do that tomorrow.	Payqa paqarinmi chayta ruwanman.
Otherwise it would be fine.	Mana chayqa allinmi kanman.
I really wanted to be there.	Anchatan munarqani chaypi kayta.
That was a really hard time.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin sasa tiempo karqan.
Perhaps it would have been better if you had .	Ichapas aswan allin kanman karqa qamqa .
An early day.	Huk ñawpaq p’unchaw.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
I wasn’t happy anymore.	Manañam kusisqachu karqani.
He seemed really happy.	Payqa chiqap kusisqa hinam karqa.
It’s hard to tell now.	Sasa kunan willay.
Do a little different.	Huk chikan ruway.
They are very, very tough.	Paykunaqa ancha, ancha sinchi kanku.
Everything else would be secondary.	Tukuy imapas iskay kaq kanman.

That’s what I think.	Chaytan yuyaykuni.
Fortunately he wasn’t alone.	Ancha kusisqa mana sapallanchu karqa.
No, it doesn’t seem like it.	Manan, manan chay hinachu rikch’akun.

You were here at night.	Tuta kaypi karqanki.

But things still went wrong.	Ichaqa hinallam tukuy imapas mana allinchu karqa.
This is the best way to keep it simple.	Kayqa aswan allinmi mana sasa ruway kananpaq.
Unless you’re beautiful, of course.	Manachus sumaq kanki chayqa, sut’inmi.

You know that very well.	Chaytaqa allintam yachanki.
That’s going to continue.	Chayqa hinallam kanqa.
He will be sure.	Payqa segurom kanqa.
He did it in a serious way.	Chaytaqa sinchitan ruwarqan.
It was a good time.	Allin tiempon karqan.
You never knew what he was going to do.	Manam haykapipas yacharqankichu ima ruwananta.

He was depressed.	Payqa llakisqa kasqa.
He is very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam kachkan.
He knows nothing about her not being here anymore.	Manam imatapas yachanchu manaña kaypi kasqanmantaqa.
That’s the way it is.	Chhayna kanman.
Maybe next year, right?.	Ichapas hamuq wata, ¿aw?.
However, this may not be the right approach.	Ichaqa manapaschá chay ruwayqa allinchu kanman.
It wouldn’t have been bad.	Manam mana allinchu kanman karqa.
It might not be that bad.	Manapaschá chayna mana allinchu kanman.
Some good, some not so good.	Wakin allin, wakin mana chayna allin.
The third person.	Kimsa kaq runa.
Maybe you’ll do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanki.
Okay, that’s a good thing.	Allinmi, chayqa allinmi.
I think it’s fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi nispan yuyaykuni.
But he actually said it.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa nirqan.
Nobody says much.	Manam pipas anchatachu nin.
You’re going to do it.	Chaytaqa ruwanki.
Do one big thing every day.	Sapa punchawmi huk hatun llamkayta ruway.
He said it was all right.	Allinmi nispa nirqa.
Maybe it’s a good thing.	Ichapas allin kaq kanman.
I wonder how it is.	Imayna kasqanmantam tapukuni.
He was very much with her.	Payqa anchatan paywan kasharqan.
You’re not that good.	Chayna mana allinchu kanki.
That is as it should be.	Chayqa imayna kanan hinam.
Do something, not that.	Imatapas ruway, mana chayta.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
Or do you not want to deal with it?.	Icha, ¿manachu chayta atipayta munanki?.
I knew it would be good.	Yacharqanim allin kananta.
Everything was fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi karqa.
That was not an easy task.	Chay ruwayqa manan facilchu karqan.

I didn’t want to do anything.	Manam imatapas ruwayta munarqanichu.
Yes, you know all about it.	Arí, chaymantaqa tukuy imatam yachanki.
He’s not a good guy.	Payqa manan allinchu.

I wasn't sure either.	Ñuqapas manam segurochu karqani.
He almost refused.	Payqa yaqapaschá mana munarqanchu.
Something was good.	Imapas allinmi karqa.
There is no duality.	Manam iskay kay kanchu.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
Otherwise it’s all good.	Mana chayqa tukuy allin.
I don’t like him.	Payqa manan gustawanchu.
It was the next day.	Paqarin punchawmi karqa.
I would love to know that.	Chayta yachayta anchata munani.
Who was it.	Pitaq karqan.

He was a little unsure.	Payqa huk chhikantan mana segurochu kasqa.
But maybe there was something.	Ichaqa ichapas imapas karqa.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I was a good guy.	Allin runam karqani.
It’s been around for a long time now.	Kunanqa unayñan kashan.
Something is wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu kachkan.

It’s good here.	Kaypiqa allinmi.
It’s all right there.	Allinmi chaypi.
This is still not really good.	Kayqa manaraqmi chiqap allinchu.
He refused to say anything.	Payqa manan imatapas rimayta munarqanchu.
That certainly would be the case here.	Cheqaqtapunin kaypiqa chhayna kanman.
He was sure there was nothing.	Payqa segurom karqa mana imapas kasqanmanta.
He didn’t know what, if anything, that might be.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu ima, sichus imapas kanman chayqa, chay kanman.

He was genuinely excited.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin kusisqa kasharqan.

He knew how bad it was.	Payqa yacharqanmi imayna mana allin kasqanmanta.
He knew he had done it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta ruwasqanmanta.
Something in there.	Imapas chaypi.
What is the characteristic?.	¿Imaynataq kanman?.
That wouldn’t be so good.	Chayqa manan chay hina allinchu kanman.
He didn’t want that.	Payqa manan chaytaqa munarqanchu.
It would be better not to do so.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana chaynata ruwayqa.
The way it is.	Imayna kasqanmanta.
This is obviously not the case.	Kayqa sut’inmi mana chay hinachu.
But it wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
How? 	Imayna?
Something bigger.	Imapas aswan hatun.
I'm sorry about that.	Chayna kasqanmantam llakikuni.
But that’s what he did.	Ichaqa chaytan ruwarqan.
However, it is recommended that you do this more frequently.	Ichaqa allinmi kanman chayta aswan sapa kuti ruwanaykipaq.
I just couldn’t figure out why.	Chaylla mana yachayta atirqanichu imarayku chayta.

This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.

It was better than that.	Aswan allinmi karqa.
He would like to know everything.	Payqa tukuy imatam yachayta munanman.
He did that to her now.	Chaytaqa kunanmi paywan ruwarqa.
They seem very angry.	Paykunaqa ancha phiñasqa hinam kanku.

I’ll be fine now.	Kunanqa allinmi kasaq.

I know it's beautiful now.	Yachanim kunan sumaq kasqanmanta.
Every day was something else.	Sapa punchawmi huk imapas karqa.
I suspect it’s good.	Sospechani allin kasqanmanta.
He certainly does.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa ruwan.
He had to be alone.	Sapallanmi kanan karqa.
It’s nothing like what came before.	Manan imapas ñawpaq hamuq hinachu.
Maybe there is, but probably not.	Ichapas kanman, ichaqa manapaschá.
You are the one who is.	Qamqa chay runam kanki.
It never means that.	Manam haykapipas chaytaqa niyta munanchu.

I’m afraid to talk.	Manchakuni rimayta.
Why does it have to be anything else?.	¿Imanasqataq huk imapas kanan?.
He looked very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam rikchakurqa.
That may not be the best option.	Chayqa manapaschá aswan allinchu kanman.
He probably still is.	Payqa yaqapaschá kunankamapas kashan.
He knew it would be bad.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana allin kananta.
He seemed overwhelmed.	Payqa llumpay llakisqa hinam karqa.

But it wasn’t a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu karqan.
This would not have been a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu kanman karqa.
You’ll learn more.	Astawan yachanki.
He refused to talk.	Payqa manan rimayta munarqanchu.
But it could have been worse.	Ichaqa aswan mana allinmi kanman karqan.
I’m not happy with it.	Manam kusisqachu kani.
He is alone.	Payqa sapallanmi.
He knew what he was going to do.	Payqa yacharqanmi ima ruwananta.

Better than nothing maybe, but .	Aswan allinmi mana imamantapas ichapas, ichaqa .
It wasn’t a bad thing.	Manam mana allinchu karqa.
He didn’t know, he didn’t want to.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu, manan munarqanchu.
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
Someone has to do something.	Pipas imatapas ruwanan.

He had always been good.	Payqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi allin kasqa.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Manam imapas kanchu.
I can't do it anymore.	Manañam ruwayta atiymanchu manañam.
I don’t want to.	Manam munanichu.
But it had to be clear.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kanan karqan.
Everything would be like last year.	Tukuy imapas qayna wata hinam kanman.
. . . .	.
He was in a deep state of distress.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan.
Such a person.	Chayna runa.
You are always angry.	Sapa kutim phiñasqa kanki.
He was a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allinmi kasqa.
He’s obviously very unwell.	Payqa sut’inmi ancha mana allinchu kashan.
Okay, they're not that good.	Allinmi, manam chayna allinchu kanku.
Everything is not right.	Tukuy imapas manam allinchu.

He had to be.	Payqa kanan karqan.
I said something wrong.	Imatapas mana allintam nirqani.
Maybe it’s early.	Ichapas temprano kanman.
Obviously, this is not correct.	Sut’inmi, kayqa manan allinchu.
It was really great.	Chiqaptam ancha allin karqa.
But it won’t be the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanqa.
I just couldn’t talk about it.	Chaylla mana chaymanta rimayta atirqanichu.
It couldn’t have been very well otherwise.	Manan ancha allintachu huk hina kanman karqan.
That would have been nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi kanman karqa.
I can’t be that person.	Manam chay runa kayta atiymanchu.

It didn't seem that good.	Manam chayna allinchu rikchakurqa.
It wasn’t always like that.	Manan sapa kutichu chhayna karqan.
He didn’t mean that.	Chaytaqa manan niyta munarqanchu.
I think he’s lonely.	Yuyaykuni sapallan kasqanmanta.
But probably not.	Ichaqa yaqapaschá mana.
Why that would be, no one knows.	Imarayku chayna kananta, mana pipas yachanchu.
What a beautiful man.	Ima sumaq runa.
But that is not an easy task.	Ichaqa chay ruwayqa manan facilchu.
It would mean something.	Imapas niyta munanman.
But I am well aware that this cannot be very safe.	Ichaqa allintam yachani kayqa manam ancha segurochu kanman.
They are doing well.	Allinmi kachkanku.
Nothing else ever.	Mana imapas huk hayk’aqpas.
He didn’t know it.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu.

It didn’t go well.	Manam allintachu rirqa.
But, not always.	Ichaqa, manan sapa kutichu.
I can’t say it.	Manam niyta atiymanchu.
But obviously this is wrong.	Ichaqa sut’inmi kayqa mana allinchu.
I am very happy indeed.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani chiqaptapuni.
No, not exactly.	Manan, manan allintachu.
You know a lot of things.	Achkatam yachanki.
It was a very tough time.	Chayqa ancha sinchi tiempon karqan.
Many, many times.	Achka, achka kuti.
There is no other way to do it.	Manan huk ruwayqa kanchu.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
I didn’t know what to do.	Manam yacharqanichu ima ruwanayta.
He is a strong, strong man.	Payqa sinchi, sinchi runam.

Now that’s what he does.	Kunanqa chaytan ruwan.

If you think about it, all the better.	Sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa, aswan allinmi.

He was angry now.	Payqa kunanqa phiñasqa kasqa.

He wanted to do something with her.	Payqa imatapas paywan ruwayta munarqa.
Is it a good idea? 	¿Allinchu kanman?
This is not a good practice.	Kay ruwayqa mana allinchu.
That’s what he wanted.	Chaytan payqa munarqan.
Maybe he’ll do that.	Ichapas chayta ruwanman.
Like, really really just.	Imayna, chiqap chiqaptapuni chaylla.
He is fine now.	Payqa kunanqa allinmi kachkan.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.

I don’t know how all this will all work out.	Mana yachanichu imaynatachus tukuy kay tukuy kanqa chayta.
It’s actually pretty interesting.	Chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi.

It couldn’t have been good, you knew.	Mana allinchu kanman karqan, chaytan yacharqanki.
He had no idea how good he was.	Payqa manan yuyaykurqanchu imayna allin kasqanmanta.
That’s not a bad thing.	Chayqa manam mana allinchu.
I can't say that.	Chaytaqa manam niyta atiymanchu.
No one knows where he is.	Manan pipas yachanchu maypi kashasqanmanta.
That seemed to be a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi rikchakurqa.

He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.

But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.

He does what he says he will do.	Nisqanman hinam ruwan.
He really wanted to do that.	Payqa anchatan munarqan chayta ruwayta.

I don’t want to say why.	Manam imarayku niyta munanichu.
He could never do that.	Payqa manan hayk’aqpas chaytaqa ruwayta atirqanchu.

You don’t know what happened.	Mana yachankichu ima pasasqanmanta.

He would be here if he could be.	Payqa kaypi kanman karqan sichus kayta atinman chayqa.

Great, actually.	Hatun, chiqaptaqa.
But this could be better.	Ichaqa kayqa aswan allinmi kanman.
That would be obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi kanman.
Maybe it won’t do well.	Ichapas mana allintachu ruwanqa.
He knew it would happen.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayna kananta.
He was here to stay.	Payqa kaypi kasqa.
He seems fine otherwise.	Payqa allinmi rikchakun mana chayqa.

I’m afraid of everything.	Tukuy imatam manchakuni.
I didn't think he would.	Manam piensarqanichu chayta ruwananta.
Hopefully not always.	Munaymanmi mana sapa kutichu.

This thing was good.	Kay imapas allinmi karqa.
Nobody likes it.	Manan pipas gustanchu.
Very happy about it.	Ancha kusisqa chaymanta.

Someone had to do it.	Pipas chayta ruwanan karqan.
Not good of me.	Mana allinchu ñuqamanta.
But it doesn’t exist.	Ichaqa manan kanchu.
He desperately wanted to win.	Payqa sinchitan atipayta munarqan.
Then it wasn't much better.	Chaymantaqa manam ancha allinchu karqa.
There is no one.	Manan pipas kanchu.

Now I want to work.	Kunanqa llamkayta munani.

It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
He said he couldn't say for sure.	Payqa nirqa mana seguro niyta atisqanmanta.
Everyone is happy, tired but happy.	Lliwmi kusisqa, sayk’usqa ichaqa kusisqa.
He certainly said that.	Cheqaqtapunin chaytaqa nirqan.
That’s pretty much it actually.	Chayqa yaqapaschá chiqaptaqa.
He thought he would.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta ruwananpaq.

No one, really.	Mana pipas, chiqaptapuni.
Alone, it wasn’t.	Sapallan, manan chay hinachu karqan.

But that’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa chayqa manan allinchu.
Everyone is there.	Lliwmi chaypi kachkanku.
It wasn’t very good.	Ancha mana allinchu karqa.
Yes, yes	Arí, arí .
He didn’t know she was angry.	Payqa manan yacharqanchu phiñasqa kashasqanmanta.
But now he was a man.	Kunanmi ichaqa runa kasqa.
That may not always be the case.	Chayqa manapaschá sapa kutichu kanman.
But it’s not anymore.	Ichaqa manañan.
Maybe both of them.	Ichapas iskayninku.
If he ever did that.	Sichus hayk’aqllapas chayta ruwarqan chayqa.

It was very clear.	Ancha sut’inmi karqan.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
I couldn’t believe he would do it right away.	Chaylla ruwananta mana creeyta atirqanichu.
Here’s how the process works.	Kaypi imaynataq chay ruwayqa kachkan.
But it went well.	Ichaqa allintam rirqa.
He’s really hurting.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin k’irisqa kashan.
That was a wonderful experience.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
This would be useful here.	Kayqa kaypiqa allinmi kanman.
He was happy to be there.	Payqa kusisqa kasharqan.
That’s a good man.	Chayqa allinmi runa.
Here’s why I want to tell you why.	Kaypi imarayku kasqanmanta willayta munani.
Like, really sad.	Imayna, chiqap llakisqa.
I wouldn’t be happy.	Mana kusisqachu kayman.
He was there day and night.	Payqa tuta punchawmi chaypi karqa.
Maybe that’s what it is.	Ichapas chayna kasqanmanta.
I didn’t want this to happen.	Manam munarqanichu kay pasananta.
That’s really good.	Chayqa chiqap allinmi.
That’s not a very good thing.	Chayqa manan ancha allinchu.
That’s the best time ever.	Chayqa aswan allin tiempon.
Tell us now!.	¡Kunan willay!.

I couldn’t help it anymore.	Manañam yanapayta atirqanichu.
If it’s the former, that’s not so good.	Sichus ñawpaq kaq kanman chayqa, chayqa manan ancha allinchu.
Nothing seemed worried.	Mana imapas llakisqa hinachu karqa.
Otherwise, he would be very seriously injured.	Mana chayqa, payqa ancha sinchitan k’irisqa kanman.
I thought that was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi nispaymi piensarqani.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
Someone said that.	Pipas chayta nisqa.
Here’s to me.	Kaypi ñuqawan.
Make it more realistic.	Aswan chiqap ruway.
I don’t think you do.	Manam yuyanichu chayta ruwasqaykita.

It would be nice to do that.	Chayta ruwayqa sumaqmi kanman.
She said yes she is.	Payqa nirqanmi arí payqa nispa.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
He seems a little nervous.	Payqa huk chikan mancharisqa hinam kachkan.
He was a great guy.	Payqa hatun runam karqa.
I don’t know why yet, or who.	Manaraqmi yachanichu imarayku, nitaq pitapas.
I know you don't want to do that.	Yachanim mana chayta ruwayta munasqaykita.
Something could be wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman.
Maybe, maybe not.	Ichapas, manapaschá.
But he was there.	Ichaqa chaypi kasharqan.
Which is fine, if you think about it.	Imataq allin, sichus chaypi yuyaykunki chayqa.
You’re a great guy.	Qamqa hatun runam kanki.
He didn’t think about anything.	Payqa manan imapipas yuyaykurqanchu.
It wasn’t a good thing.	Manam allinchu karqa.
He was very nice to her.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi paywan karqa.
I don’t want to be this.	Manam kayta munanichu.
It won’t be easy.	Manam facilchu kanqa.
Maybe it should be.	Ichapas chayna kanan.
Where we are.	Maypi kanchik.
I don’t want to play into it.	Chayman pukllayta mana munanichu.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
But this is by no means certain.	Ichaqa manan imapipas segurochu kayqa.
I know he can't.	Yachanim mana atisqanmanta.
Isn't anything like it used to be.	Manachu imapas ñawpaq hinachu.
What could be better!?.	¿Imataq aswan allin kanman!?.
You were badly hurt.	Sinchitan k’irisqa karqanki.
But that’s a big if.	Ichaqa chayqa hatun sichus.
Maybe he should have.	Ichapas chayta ruwanan kanman karqa.
I was injured.	K'irisqa karqani.
Be here with me.	Kaypi ñuqawan kay.
I am now.	Kunanqa kani.
He knows he won’t.	Payqa yachanmi mana chayta ruwananta.
But here’s the second thing.	Ichaqa kaypi iskay kaq kaq.
Everyone is here tonight.	Lliwmi kunan tuta kaypi kachkanku.
But he refused to be there with her.	Ichaqa manan munarqanchu paywan kuska chaypi kayta.
Can't tell you about this yet.	Manaraqmi kaymanta willayta atinchu.
Now do this.	Kunanqa kayta ruway.
I think that’s a great thing to do.	Chay ruwayqa ancha allinmi, nispan yuyaykuni.
He probably was.	Payqa yaqapaschá chayna karqa.
That’s what he did best.	Chaytan aswan allinta ruwarqan.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
He should be here soon.	Payqa usqhayllan kaypi kanan.
I don’t know what’s going to happen.	Manam yachanichu ima pasananta.
That something is wrong.	Imapas mana allin kasqanmanta.
He thought he would.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi chayta ruwananpaq.
I guess I know something.	Yaqapaschá imatapas yachani.
Very, very good thing.	Ancha, ancha allin kaq.
A bit of everything, really.	Huk chikan tukuy imamanta, chiqaptapuni.
But he knew he had to do something.	Ichaqa yacharqanmi imatapas ruwananta.
Of course, he wasn’t.	Arí, payqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
She could tell he was nervous.	Payqa repararqanmi mancharisqa kashasqanmanta.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.
Two things here.	Iskay imakuna kaypi.
I don’t want to know more about it.	Manam chaymanta astawan yachayta munanichu.
He’s alone though.	Payqa sapallanmi ichaqa.
Otherwise it was great.	Mana chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He was a good guy.	Payqa allinmi kasqa.
I don’t know, maybe.	Manam yachanichu, ichapas.
You can’t tell.	Manan yachayta atiwaqchu.
It looks like that.	Chayna rikchakun.
It is a very important thing to do.	Chayta ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
They seem happier.	Aswan kusisqa hinam kanku.
It didn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu karqa.
That he could well believe.	Allinta creeyta atisqanmanta.
That really did it.	Chayqa chiqaptam ruwarqa.
It was clear he never would.	Sut’inmi karqan mana hayk’aqpas ruwananta.
Nobody, but nobody.	Mana pipas, ichaqa mana pipas.
You weren’t good enough’.	Mana allinchu karqanki’.
But it’s okay.	Ichaqa allinmi kachkan.
I’ve done that.	Chaytaqa ruwarqani.
I really like that.	Chayqa anchatam gustan.
I really want to talk.	Anchatan munani rimayta.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
I'll do it quickly.	Utqaylla ruwasaq.
Other than that, the process was successful.	Mana chaymantaqa, chay ruwayqa allinmi karqa.
But I don’t know why.	Ichaqa manan yachanichu imarayku chayta.
Something was wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allinchu karqa.
That was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqa.
One person, two people.	Huk runa, iskay runa.
Terrified of everything.	Tukuy imamanta mancharisqa.
Something seemed really wrong.	Imapas chiqap mana allin hinam karqa.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
I think that was a good thing.	Chayqa allinmi karqan, nispan yuyaykuni.
He had been a lonely man for a long time.	Unayñan sapallan runa kasqa.
It’s not quite right.	Manam allintachu.
I am so sorry about everything.	Anchatam llakikuni tukuy imamanta.
Like, somebody is doing this.	Imayna, wakin runa kayta ruwachkan.
He was genuinely frightened.	Cheqaqtapunin mancharisqa karqan.
He said he was sure.	Payqa seguro kasqanmantam nirqa.
It was beautiful, as always.	Sumaqmi karqa, sapa kuti hina.
I’m more unsure.	Aswan mana segurochu kani.
He said that he did.	Payqa nirqam chayna ruwasqanmanta.
But nothing about it.	Ichaqa manan imapas chaymantaqa.
There really could be a lot of things.	Chiqaptam achka imakuna kanman.
He can't go.	Payqa manam riyta atinmanchu.
Today was a good day.	Kunan punchawqa allin punchawmi karqa.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
I knew you would.	Yacharqanim chayta ruwanaykipaq.
He was there the whole time.	Payqa tukuy tiempon chaypi karqan.
I know nothing about that.	Chaymantaqa manam imatapas yachanichu.
Is this a good thing?.	¿Allinchu kayqa?.
He had wanted it for a long time.	Payqa unayñan chayta munarqan.
Like last year.	Qayna wata hina.
Someone told me.	Pipas niwarqa.
Everything is almost too good to be true.	Tukuy imapas yaqa ancha allinmi.
But no, this wasn’t enough yet.	Ichaqa manan, kayqa manaraqmi allinchu karqan.
Now it’s gone.	Kunanqa manaña kanchu.
I know this for a fact.	Kaytaqa allintam yachani.
He wished he wouldn't.	Munarqa mana chayta ruwananta.
But he couldn’t.	Ichaqa manan atirqanchu.
I was excited all morning.	Tukuy paqarinmi kusisqa karqani.
Yes, he was right.	Arí, payqa allintam nirqa.
Now it’s okay.	Kunanqa allinmi.
First, make a good cup of coffee.	Ñawpaqtaqa allin kukata ruway.
There are so many more of us.	Anchatam aswan achka kanchik.
Nothing is right.	Manan imapas allinchu.
It’s good to be with you.	Allinmi qanwan kayqa.
It was like he was scared of me.	Chayqa ñuqamanta mancharisqa hinam karqa.
What am I going to do.	Imatam ruwasaq.
I’m glad he did.	Kusikuni chayta ruwasqanmanta.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu karqa.
Something was there.	Imapas chaypi kasqa.
The name says it all.	Sutinmi tukuy chayta nin.
He did well in it.	Payqa allintan chaypi ruwarqan.
Yes, that is what he had to do.	Arí, chaytan ruwanan karqan.
If not, please specify your preferences.	Mana chayqa, ama hina kaspa willay imakuna munasqaykita.
Now it will be yours.	Kunanqa qampaq kanqa.
That was everything.	Chayqa tukuy imapas karqa.
Now be quick.	Kunanqa utqaylla kay.
But at the time, we didn’t care.	Ichaqa chay tiempopiqa manan imananpaschu kayku.
Many times.	Achka kuti.
Nothing here yet.	Manaraqmi kaypi imapas.
I meant, that’s all.	Niyta munarqani, chaylla.
It was there all the time.	Tukuy tiempo chaypi kasqa.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
Indeed, he did.	Cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
He looked tired and exhausted.	Payqa sayk’usqa, sayk’usqa hinan karqan.
Everything was great.	Tukuy imapas ancha allinmi karqa.
Everything is fine now.	Kunanqa tukuy imapas allinmi.
Nothing, then .	Mana imapas, chaymanta .
More than he was worried.	Aswan llakisqa kasqanmantaqa.
I mean, what could have been why.	Niyta munani, imataq kanman karqan imarayku.
He didn't care about that.	Chaytaqa manam imananpaschu karqa.
This would be the case.	Kayta ruwanman.
I was yours, once.	Ñuqaqa qampaq karqani, huk kuti.
Not much anymore.	Manaña anchatachu.
One of these.	Huk chaymanta.
I didn't think it would happen.	Manam piensarqanichu chayna kananta.
That was actually pretty interesting.	Chayqa chiqaptaqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
Every day is difficult.	Sapa punchawmi sasa.
Here are ten of us.	Kaypi chunka kanchik.
This is the one.	Kayqa chay.
I knew it would never work out.	Yacharqanim mana haykapipas allin kananta.
I didn’t think much of it.	Mana anchatachu chaypi yuyaykurqani.
That’s a very bad thing.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi.
Not now though.	Mana kunan ichaqa.
It was very early, after all.	Ancha temprano karqan, tukuy imamanta.
That’s obviously wrong.	Chayqa sut’inmi mana allinchu.
I know that for sure.	Chaytaqa allintam yachani.
There isn’t.	Manam kanchu.
No.	Manam.
The best part of it.	Aswan allin kaq.
Then the truth.	Chaymanta chiqap.
I did something.	Imatapas ruwarqani.
She’s beautiful.	Payqa sumaqmi.
I know it happened too late.	Yachanim ancha tarde pasasqanmanta.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
I've never been here before.	Manam haykapipas kaypichu karqani.
That, however, was not the case.	Chayqa ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqan.
He would be alone.	Payqa sapallanmi kanman.
That meant if this was good, it could come again.	Chayqa niyta munarqa sichus kay allin kanman chayqa, hukmanta hamuyta atinman.
I'm very happy, I mean.	Ancha kusisqam kachkani, niyta munani.
She was more beautiful now.	Payqa kunanqa aswan sumaqmi kasqa.
Things could be worse.	Aswan mana allinmi kanman imapas.
It was not easy as to why.	Imarayku kasqanmantaqa manam facilchu karqa.
That was a very bad thing.	Chayqa ancha mana allinmi karqa.
I don’t want to know anything.	Manam imatapas yachayta munanichu.
It won’t be the first time.	Manan ñawpaq kutichu kanqa.
I did this job the night before.	Kay llamk’ayta ruwarqani ñawpaq tuta.
I don’t want to be second.	Manam iskay kaq kayta munanichu.
It would be a good one.	Allinmi kanman.
But it isn’t.	Ichaqa manan.
I don’t want to talk anymore.	Manañam rimayta munanichu.
He is not alone.	Payqa manan sapallanchu.
But this looks interesting.	Ichaqa kayqa sumaqmi rikchakun.
Very nice second and third for sure.	Ancha sumaq iskay kaq kimsa kaq seguro.
I didn’t mean to say no to that.	Manam chayta mana niyta munarqanichu.
But it’s really hard.	Ichaqa cheqaqtapunin sinchi sasa.
I think that's what it is.	Chayna kasqanmantam piensani.
Nobody likes it.	Manam pimanpas gustanchu.
That was certainly the first step.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin ñawpaq kaq ruway karqan.
That’s the way it is.	Chay hina.
He did a good job.	Allin llamkayta ruwarqa.
Yes, this is a very good thing.	Arí, kayqa ancha allinmi.
But it can’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
He’s a really nice guy.	Payqa chiqap sumaq runam.

I wonder what’s wrong with him.	Tapukuni imataq paywan kachkan nispa.
Something isn’t right.	Imapas mana allinchu.
Why? 	Imanasqa?
They are	Paykunaqa .
Maybe you don’t know you don’t.	Ichapas mana yachankichu mana ruwasqaykita.
That’s probably what he said.	Chayqa yaqapaschá nirqa.
That’s what he said.	Chayqa nisqa.
But it won’t be easy.	Ichaqa manan facilchu kanqa.
But this is a very good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa ancha allinmi.
That’s obvious.	Chayqa sut’inmi.
It’s going to be nice.	Sumaqmi kanqa.
He was very upset and angry.	Payqa ancha phiñasqa, phiñasqa ima kasqa.
That’s not a good thing.	Chayqa manan allinchu.
But this was not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manan allinchu karqan.
It’s been there for a long time.	Unayñan chaypi kashan.
You will do very well here.	Kaypiqa ancha allintam ruwanki.
I can’t say that.	Manam chaytaqa niyta atiymanchu.
An earlier one then almost worse.	Huk ñawpaq chaymanta yaqa aswan mana allin.
Yes, a good person is good.	Arí, allin runa allinmi.
It was a good year.	Allin wata karqa.
He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam karqa.
That may not be the right thing to do.	Chayqa manapaschá allinchu kanman.
I hope everything will be fine.	Suyachkani tukuy imapas allin kananta.
Maybe it’s there.	Ichapas chaypi kanman.
Hopefully everything goes well.	Munaymanmi tukuy ima allin kananpaq.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
What is it, he said.	Imataq, nispa.
But this wouldn’t be a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu kanman kayqa.
Maybe one day, someone will.	Ichapas huk punchaw, pipas ruwanqa.
I think you did a great job.	Yuyaykuni ancha hatun llamkayta ruwasqaykita.
But that is not the case today.	Ichaqa kunan tiempopiqa manan chay hinachu kashan.
This is not easy.	Kayqa manam facilchu.
I can’t believe it.	Manam creeyta atinichu.
Yeah, that’s nice.	Arí, chayqa sumaqmi.
I'll keep going.	Hinallam risaq.
It was still going on.	Hinallam karqa.
But it’s very interesting.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi.
That’s the time.	Chay tiempon.
He would be really, really busy.	Payqa chiqap, chiqap ocupasqa kanman.
I was hurt, yes.	K’irisqa karqani, arí.
But it’s very interesting.	Ichaqa ancha sumaqmi.
Something told him not to go there.	Imapas nirqam chayman ama rinanpaq.
They had to be.	Paykunaqa kanan karqan.
He was eager to help.	Payqa anchatan yanapayta munarqan.
Time does it.	Tiempo ruwan.
He did a good job of it.	Payqa allintam ruwarqa.
If anyone can do that.	Sichus pipas chayta ruwayta atinman chayqa.
I need to do this quickly.	Kayta utqaylla ruwanay tiyan.
I didn’t know that.	Chaytaqa manam yacharqanichu.
But it’s not a good thing.	Ichaqa manan allinchu.
He knows a lot about it.	Payqa anchatam yachan.
Something seemed wrong here.	Kaypiqa imapas mana allin hinam karqa.
We’re about ten of us.	Chunka hinam kanchik.
Do it regularly.	Sapa kuti ruway.
I don’t want to make it too long.	Manam ancha unaytachu ruwayta munani.

I really want you to be there.	Anchatam munani chaypi kasqaykita.
I'd rather be here.	Aswan allinmi kaypi kachkani.
What is the third.	Imataq kimsa kaq.
But he knew nothing about it.	Ichaqa manan imatapas chaymantaqa yacharqanchu.
This seems very good.	Kayqa ancha allinmi rikchakun.
The right thing to do.	Allin kaq.
It was worse now.	Kunanqa aswan mana allinchu kasqa.
He is still there.	Payqa hinallam kachkan.
I am very sorry about that.	Anchatam chaymanta llakikuni.
He wasn’t easy.	Payqa manan facilchu karqan.
Me too.	Ñuqapas.
He refused to believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta munarqanchu.
Everything else perhaps.	Tukuy imapas ichapas.
But he couldn't say that.	Ichaqa manan chayta niyta atirqanchu.
It’s not safe at all.	Manam imapipas segurochu.
It was a beautiful day.	Sumaq punchawmi karqa.
You have always been like that.	Qamqa ñawpaqmantaraqmi chayna karqanki.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
She was very nice.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi karqa.
They are nothing like that.	Paykunaqa manan imapas chay hinachu kanku.
Maybe it’s the same.	Ichapas chayna kanman.
No coffee for you.	Mana kukata qampaq.
He is everything.	Payqa tukuy imapas.
He was in a deep state of distress.	Payqa sinchi llakisqa kasharqan.
He doesn't seem happy to be here.	Payqa manam kusisqachu rikchakun kaypi kasqanmantaqa.
What do you know that he didn’t?.	¿Imatataq yachanki mana chayta ruwasqanmanta?.
I really want that.	Chaytaqa anchatam munani.
He was very happy.	Ancha kusisqa karqan.
Can't say why.	Mana imarayku niyta atinchu.
I think that's where it's at.	Chayqa chaypi kasqanmantam piensani.
He is a very genuine person.	Payqa ancha chiqap runam.
That's good.	Chayqa allinmi.
Now he did that.	Kunanqa chayta ruwarqa.
That wasn’t easy.	Chayqa manan facilchu karqan.

Three quick ones.	Kimsa utqaylla.
He said the truth.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin nirqan.
I didn’t really want to do it.	Manam anchatachu ruwayta munarqani.
That went well enough.	Chayqa allintam rirqa.
It was the best time ever.	Chayqa aswan allin tiempon karqan.
I'll be happy to do that for you.	Kusisqam chayta ruwasaq qampaq.
It’s not a good thing.	Mana allinchu.

This is a very interesting one.	Kayqa ancha sumaqmi.

If you want to.	Sichus munanki chayqa.
I can't say how many.	Manam niyta atiymanchu hayka kasqanmantaqa.
But it didn’t work out before.	Ichaqa manan ñawpaqtaqa allinchu karqan.
He knows exactly where he needs to be.	Payqa allintam yachan maypi kananta.
Maybe this is a good thing.	Ichapas kayqa allin kanman.

It would mean something.	Imapas niyta munanman karqa.
That was a long time ago.	Chayqa unayñan karqan.
I really don't know everything.	Chiqaptaqa manam tukuy imatapas yachanichu.
That means he’s there.	Chayqa niyta munan payqa chaypi kachkan.
I know that it is not.	Yachanim mana chayna kasqanmanta.
There is so much background.	Ancha achka ñawpaqmantaraqmi kachkan.
But I didn’t want to talk.	Ichaqa manan rimayta munarqanichu.
You never know.	Qamqa manam haykapipas yachankichu.
I hope one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw.
Do the best you can do.	Aswan allin ruway atisqaykita ruway.
I don't know what to do here.	Manam yachanichu kaypi imata ruwanaypaq.
I would be like that person.	Chay runa hinam kayman.
Here he was not sure.	Kaypiqa manam segurochu karqa.
He wasn't quite sure where he was.	Payqa manan allintachu seguro kasharqan maypi kasqanmanta.
You knew that a long time ago.	Unayñan chaytaqa yacharqanki.
It doesn’t mean anything anymore.	Manañam imatapas niyta munanchu.
First this, then that.	Ñawpaqtaqa kayta, chaymanta chayta.
But it shouldn’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan.
He said he couldn’t.	Mana atisqanmanta nisqa.
Construction was quick.	Ruwayqa usqhayllan karqan.
It’s a very good one.	Ancha allinmi.
They are not here.	Paykunaqa manan kaypiqa kanchu.
He couldn’t believe it.	Payqa manan creeyta atirqanchu.
This was obvious.	Kayqa sut’inmi karqan.
This is a beautiful one.	Kayqa sumaqmi.
The whole day was great.	Tukuy punchawmi ancha allin karqa.
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
That’s never a good thing.	Chayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu.
He knew how to deal with it.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta imayna atipananta.
He's faster though.	Payqa aswan utqaylla ichaqa.
The real thing, maybe.	Chiqap kaq, ichapas.
He is with you now.	Payqa kunanmi qanwan kachkan.
But I wasn’t like that.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu karqani.
No one wants to be uncertain.	Manan pipas mana seguro kayta munanchu.
Needless to say that was never a good thing.	Manañam niyta munanichu chayqa manam haykapipas allinchu karqa.
He had to do it.	Payqa ruwanan karqan.
Something could have gone wrong.	Imapas mana allinchu kanman karqa.
It’s been around for a long time.	Unayñan kashan.
I can't believe he's here.	Manam creeyta atinichu kaypi kasqanmanta.
But it would be a bad thing.	Ichaqa mana allinmi kanman.
That’s a very nice thing.	Chayqa ancha sumaqmi.
Alright.	Allinmi.
That would be a bad thing.	Chayqa mana allinchu kanman.
Nothing too bad.	Mana imapas ancha mana allinchu.
But it can’t be that way.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanman.
Nothing about me.	Mana imapas ñuqamanta.
That will always be the case.	Chayqa sapa kutim kanqa.
He really wanted to do it.	Payqa anchatam ruwayta munarqa.
Good, very good, but not good.	Allin, ancha allin, ichaqa mana allinchu.
I mean, he’s a good guy.	Niyta munani, payqa allin runam.
I don’t know what yet.	Manaraqmi yachanichu imata.
He doesn’t want to go.	Payqa manam riyta munanchu.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
Not scared or anything.	Mana mancharisqa nitaq ima.
You can’t beat it.	Mana atipayta atiwaqchu.
Yes, there it is.	Arí, chaypi.
Two afternoons.	Iskay tarde.
I meant to say.	Niyta munarqani.
He was always so good.	Payqa sapa kutim chayna allin karqa.
This process is very important.	Kay ruwayqa ancha allinmi.
You’ll find out soon enough.	Chaytaqa usqhayllan yachanki.
He was injured.	Payqa k’irisqa kasharqan.
I was worried all day.	Tukuy punchawmi llakisqa karqani.
He certainly did.	Cheqaqtapunin ruwarqan.
Which was a good thing.	Imataq allin karqa.
Thirty more wounded.	Kimsa chunka aswan k’irisqa.
It didn't look right.	Manam allintachu rikchakurqa.
I'm still here.	Hinallam kaypi kachkani.
He wasn’t alone.	Payqa manam sapallanchu karqa.
No one knows why.	Manan pipas yachanchu imarayku chaytaqa.
About being good.	Allin kaymanta.
There will be a day.	Huk punchawmi kanqa.
I think you should do that.	Yuyaykuni chayta ruwanayki tiyan.
It was a very nice experience.	Ancha sumaqmi karqa.
But it’s good.	Ichaqa allinmi.
You can’t do that.	Chaytaqa manam ruwayta atiwaqchu.
But this is not a good thing.	Ichaqa kayqa manam allinchu.
He was very tired.	Payqa ancha sayk’usqa kasqa.
Otherwise you’ll be fine.	Mana chayqa allinmi kanki.
He was very happy.	Payqa ancha kusisqam karqa.
He knows what he wants to do.	Payqa yachanmi ima ruway munasqanmanta.
If that’s what you want.	Sichus chayta munanki chayqa.
He didn’t want to.	Payqa manan munarqanchu.
Now he does it all the time.	Kunanqa tukuy tiempon chayta ruwan.
He wanted to do it.	Payqa ruwayta munarqa.
I want to talk to you.	Rimayta munani.
No, it’s not.	Manan, manan.
He was probably nervous.	Payqa yaqapaschá mancharisqa kasharqan.
He was hardly alone.	Payqa yaqapaschá sapallan kasharqan.
No one is alone.	Manan pipas sapallanchu.
Obviously it wasn’t right.	Sut’inmi mana allinchu kasharqan.
Never.	Mana hayk’aqpas.
This is not a good thing.	Kayqa manam allinchu.
Today would have been a great day.	Kunan punchawqa hatun punchawmi kanman karqa.
It should be beautiful.	Sumaq kanan.
Yes, every single day.	Arí, sapa sapa punchaw.
Now, he probably wanted her to.	Kunanqa, yaqapaschá chayta ruwananta munarqan.
That’s what it does.	Chayqa ruwan.
But this was a long time ago.	Ichaqa kayqa unayñan kasharqan.
He was angry about everything.	Payqa tukuy imamanta phiñasqa kasqa.
He knew he didn't like that.	Payqa yacharqanmi chayta mana gustasqanmanta.
You do it all the time.	Tukuy tiempon chayta ruwanki.
I always think so.	Sapa kutim chaynata piensani.
Monday was such a day.	Lunes punchawmi chayna punchaw karqa.
I hope it's not too late now.	Suyachkani kunan mana ancha tarde kananpaq.
If it looked good, that was a good thing.	Allinmi rikchakurqa chayqa allinmi karqa.
He is a good guy.	Payqa allin runam.
I'm so sorry.	Anchatam llakikuni.
This process continued.	Kay ruwayqa hinallam karqa.
Why is it there? 	¿Imanasqataq chaypi?
I like this one better.	Kayqa aswan allintam gustan.
He’s doing well.	Payqa allinmi kachkan.
But I’m not quite sure how.	Ichaqa manan allintachu yachani imaynatachus chayta.
If anyone can help it would be great.	Sichus pipas yanapayta atinman chayqa ancha allinmi kanman.
Of course, this was not always the case.	Arí, manam sapa kutichu chayna karqa.
That’s the kind of thing.	Chayna kaq.
Perhaps he would like to.	Yaqapaschá payqa munanman.
I don’t know how many there are.	Manam yachanichu hayka kasqanmanta.
That was not good at all.	Chayqa manan imapipas allinchu karqan.
I don’t know what, really.	Mana yachanichu imata, chiqaptapuni.
This is a bad thing.	Kayqa mana allinmi.
Something that is important to you.	Imapas qampaq ancha allin kaq.
But things are never that simple.	Ichaqa manan hayk’aqpas chay hina facilchu imapas.
You have to do something.	Imatapas ruwanayki.
This isn’t so much now.	Kayqa manan anchatachu kunanqa.
That is perhaps the most difficult task.	Chay ruwayqa yaqapaschá aswan sasa ruwayqa.
So true, so true, so true.	Chayna chiqap, ancha chiqap, ancha chiqap.
Make it safer.	Aswan seguro kananpaq ruway.
He is a very good guy.	Payqa ancha allin runam.
I don’t like it, but it’s good.	Manam gustanchu, ichaqa allinmi.
But it was a good first step.	Ichaqa allinmi karqan ñawpaq kaq ruway.
This would never be a good thing.	Kayqa manan hayk’aqpas allinchu kanman.
He knew it was wrong.	Payqa yacharqanmi mana allin kasqanmanta.
What’s the right thing.	Imataq allin.
She was very sad and depressed.	Payqa ancha llakisqa, sinchi llakisqa ima kasqa.
Not sure of it.	Mana segurochu.
It doesn’t matter.	Manam imananpaschu.
You have to keep doing it.	Chaytaqa hinallam ruwanayki.
Maybe it’s .	Ichapas chayqa .
Maybe that was that.	Ichapas chay chay karqa.
He seemed very lonely.	Payqa ancha sapallanmi rikchakurqa.
But now, of course, he is.	Ichaqa kunanqa, sut’inmi, payqa kashan.
He’s too nice not to.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi mana ruwananpaq.
Not much there really.	Mana anchatachu chaypi chiqaptaqa.
I don’t know about that.	Chaytaqa manam yachanichu.
However, this doesn’t seem quite right.	Ichaqa, kayqa manan allintachu rikch’akun.
It couldn’t be easier.	Manan aswan facilchu kanman.
If you want to.	Sichus munanki chayqa.
That certainly did it.	Chayqa cheqaqtapunin chayta ruwarqan.
He did it accordingly.	Chayman hinam chayta ruwarqa.
I don’t know what it is.	Manam yachanichu imamanta.
It is indeed so.	Cheqaqtapunin chhayna.
Something really wrong.	Imapas chiqap mana allintachu.
I will never be good enough.	Manam haykapipas allinchu kasaq.
That seemed nice.	Chayqa sumaqmi rikchakurqa.
That wasn’t a good thing.	Chayqa manam allinchu karqa.
I couldn’t tell.	Manam willayta atirqanichu.
The process is unique.	Chay ruwayqa sapallanmi.
He thought today would be better.	Payqa yuyaykurqanmi kunan p’unchay aswan allin kananta.
Maybe it’s here.	Ichapas kaypi kachkan.
I know they are here.	Yachanim kaypi kasqankuta.
That’s okay, though.	Chayqa allinmi, ichaqa.
Everything will be fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi kanqa.
They are here every day.	Sapa punchawmi kaypi kachkanku.
Things are not that simple.	Imapas manam chayna facilchu.
He knows how that happened.	Payqa yachanmi imayna chay pasasqanmanta.
I did it right.	Allintam ruwarqani.
He doesn’t exist.	Payqa manam kanchu.
This is a very good thing.	Kayqa ancha allinmi.
But never again.	Ichaqa manaña hayk’aqpas.
I’m sure there’s more.	Seguro kani aswan kasqanmanta.
He didn’t do it right.	Payqa manam allintachu ruwarqa.
He’s worried about me.	Payqa ñuqamanta llakisqa kachkan.
You want to be quick.	Utqaylla kayta munanki.
But it was not to be.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu kanan karqan.
Otherwise it will fail.	Mana chayqa mana allintachu ruwanqa.
Who was here, or there.	Pitaq kaypi karqa, icha chaypi.
He wasn’t happy.	Manam kusisqachu karqa.
I don’t want that to happen.	Manam munanichu chayna kananta.
She’s a very nice guy.	Payqa ancha sumaqmi.
I am very sorry about that.	Anchatam llakikuni chaymanta.
Everything seems fine.	Tukuy imapas allinmi rikchakun.
That's, well, never.	Chayqa, allinmi, mana hayk'aqpas.
That is today.	Chayqa kunan punchawmi.
But one after the other.	Ichaqa hukmanta hukmanta.
That was a great experience.	Chayqa ancha allinmi karqa.
He was like a man.	Payqa huk runa hinam karqa.
I have to do this all the time.	Kaytaqa sapa kutim ruwanay.
I am very sorry about that.	Chaymantaqa anchatam llakikuni.
Really, really, really really.	Chiqap, chiqap, chiqap chiqap.
That wasn’t very good.	Chayqa manan ancha allinchu karqan.
I know it is, actually.	Yachanim chayna kasqanmanta, chiqaptaqa.
This is very obvious.	Kayqa ancha sut’inmi.
He is with her now.	Payqa kunanmi paywan kachkan.
If you want to go.	Riyta munaspaqa.
I hope to be there one day.	Suyachkani huk punchaw chaypi kayta.
If there was one thing to do, it was good.	Sichus huk ruway karqan chayqa, allinmi karqan.
The third cup of coffee.	Kimsa kaq kukata.
It was a good one.	Allinmi karqa.
No, but .	Manan, ichaqa .
Not sure why.	Mana segurochu imarayku.
I need to do better.	Aswan allinta ruwanay tiyan.
But it is not the case.	Ichaqa manan chay hinachu.
I'd rather not be there.	Aswan allinmi kanman mana chaypi kayqa.
Probably two or three.	Yaqapaschá iskay kimsa.
This could be the worst thing ever.	Kayqa aswan mana allinmi kanman imapipas.
It didn’t seem real.	Manam chiqap hinachu karqa.
Yes, he wants to talk to you.	Arí, payqa qanwan rimayta munan.
He truly means every word.	Payqa cheqaqtapunin sapa simita niyta munan.
I’m not going to do it any other way.	Manam huk hinachu ruwasaq.
I am very happy here.	Kaypiqa ancha kusisqam kachkani.
He knew he was a good man.	Payqa yacharqanmi allin runa kasqanmanta.
He knows where he is.	Payqa yachanmi maypi kasqanmanta.
That was, once upon a time.	Chayqa karqan, huk kuti.
Too much too much.	Llumpay llumpay.
That’s what you had to do.	Chaytan ruwanayki karqan.
However, this is not always the case.	Ichaqa manan sapa kutichu chhayna kanman.
But it’s a lot more interesting than that.	Ichaqa chaymantaqa aswan sumaqmi.
That’s fast, for sure.	Chayqa utqaylla, seguro.
No, please .	Manan, ama hina kaspa .
I couldn’t tell.	Manam willayta atirqanichu.
This was the second time.	Kayqa iskay kaq kutim karqa.
Of course, this wouldn’t be right.	Arí, kayqa manan allinchu kanman.
Obviously this has to be there.	Sut’inmi kayqa chaypi kanan.
He knew, man.	Payqa yacharqanmi, runa.
This is very obvious.	Kayqa ancha sut’inmi.
But it won’t do very well.	Ichaqa manan ancha allintachu ruwanqa.
I may not have done anything wrong.	Manapaschá mana allintachu ruwarqani.
He wasn’t sure what.	Payqa manan segurochu kasqa imamanta.
Who is this? 	Pitaq kay?
I can’t believe it.	Mana creeyta atinichu.
He is alone in the scene.	Payqa sapallanmi kachkan.
He’s clear he wants to.	Payqa sut’inmi munasqanmanta.
I thought that was really interesting.	Chayqa ancha sumaq kasqanmantam piensarqani.
